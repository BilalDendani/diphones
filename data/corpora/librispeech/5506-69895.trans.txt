5506-69895-0000 HE WAS SITTING ON THE FENCE AT THE END OF HIS GARDEN AND SURVEYING THE GREAT BUN HILL GAS WORKS WITH AN EYE THAT NEITHER PRAISED NOR BLAMED ABOVE THE CLUSTERING GASOMETERS THREE UNFAMILIAR SHAPES APPEARED THIN WALLOWING BLADDERS THAT FLAPPED AND ROLLED ABOUT AND GREW BIGGER AND BIGGER AND ROUNDER AND ROUNDER

5506-69895-0003 WHAT THEY DROPPED AS BALLASE
5506-69895-0004 I SUPPOSE WE GOT TO CALL EM LADIES SAID MISTER TOM SMALLWAYS
5506-69895-0005 THROWING GRAVEL AT PEOPLE IT AIN'T WHAT I BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO CONSIDER LADYLIKE WHETHER OR NO MISTER STRINGER NODDED HIS HEAD APPROVINGLY AND FOR A TIME THEY CONTINUED TO REGARD THE SWELLING BULKS WITH EXPRESSIONS THAT HAD CHANGED FROM INDIFFERENCE TO DISAPPROVAL
5506-69895-0006 MISTER TOM SMALLWAYS WAS A GREEN GROCER BY TRADE AND A GARDENER BY DISPOSITION HIS LITTLE WIFE JESSICA SAW TO THE SHOP AND HEAVEN HAD PLANNED HIM FOR A PEACEFUL WORLD
5506-69895-0007 UNFORTUNATELY HEAVEN HAD NOT PLANNED A PEACEFUL WORLD FOR HIM HE LIVED IN A WORLD OF OBSTINATE AND INCESSANT CHANGE AND IN PARTS WHERE ITS OPERATIONS WERE UNSPARINGLY CONSPICUOUS VICISSITUDE WAS IN THE VERY SOIL HE TILLED
5506-69895-0008 AND OVERSHADOWED BY A HUGE BOARD THAT PROCLAIMED IT NOT SO MUCH A GARDEN AS AN ELIGIBLE BUILDING SITE HE WAS HORTICULTURE UNDER NOTICE TO QUIT THE LAST PATCH OF COUNTRY IN A DISTRICT FLOODED BY NEW AND OTHER THINGS
5506-69895-0009 HE DID HIS BEST TO CONSOLE HIMSELF TO IMAGINE MATTERS NEAR THE TURN OF THE TIDE YOU'D HARDLY THINK IT COULD KEEP ON HE SAID MISTER SMALLWAYS AGED FATHER COULD REMEMBER BUN HILL
5506-69895-0010 AS AN IDYLLIC KENTISH VILLAGE HE HAD DRIVEN SIR PETER BONE UNTIL HE WAS FIFTY AND THEN HE TOOK TO DRINK A LITTLE AND DRIVING THE STATION BUS
5506-69895-0011 THEN HE RETIRED HE SAT BY THE FIRESIDE A SHRIVELLED VERY VERY OLD COACHMAN FULL CHARGED WITH REMINISCENCES AND READY FOR ANY CARELESS STRANGER HE COULD TELL YOU OF THE VANISHED ESTATE OF SIR PETER BONE LONG SINCE CUT UP FOR BUILDING
5506-69895-0012 AND HOW THAT MAGNATE RULED THE COUNTRY SIDE WHEN IT WAS COUNTRY SIDE OF SHOOTING AND HUNTING AND OF CACHES ALONG THE HIGH ROAD OF HOW WHERE THE GAS WORKS IS WAS A CRICKET FIELD AND OF THE COMING OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE
5506-69895-0013 THE CRYSTAL PALACE WAS SIX MILES AWAY FROM BUN HILL A GREAT FACADE THAT GLITTERED IN THE MORNING AND WAS A CLEAR BLUE OUTLINE AGAINST THE SKY IN THE AFTERNOON AND OF A NIGHT A SOURCE OF GRATUITOUS FIREWORKS FOR ALL THE POPULATION OF BUN HILL
5506-69895-0014 AND THEN HAD COME THE RAILWAY
5506-69895-0015 AND THEN DRAINAGE AND THE WATER VANISHED OUT OF THE OTTERBOURNE AND LEFT IT A DREADFUL DITCH AND THEN A SECOND RAILWAY STATION BUN HILL SOUTH AND MORE HOUSES AND MORE MORE SHOPS MORE COMPETITION
5506-69895-0016 PLATE GLASS SHOPS A SCHOOL BOARD RATES OMNIBUSES TRAMCARS GOING RIGHT AWAY INTO LONDON ITSELF BICYCLES MOTOR CARS AND THEN MORE MOTOR CARS A CARNEGIE LIBRARY
5506-69895-0017 YOU'D HARDLY THINK IT COULD KEEP ON SAID MISTER TOM SMALLWAYS GROWING UP AMONG THESE MARVELS BUT IT KEPT ON
5506-69895-0018 EVEN FROM THE FIRST THE GREEN GROCER'S SHOP WHICH HE HAD SET UP IN ONE OF THE SMALLEST OF THE OLD SURVIVING VILLAGE HOUSES IN THE TAIL OF THE HIGH STREET HAD A SUBMERGED AIR AN AIR OF HIDING FROM SOMETHING THAT WAS LOOKING FOR IT
5506-69895-0019 THEY LEVELLED THAT UP SO THAT ONE HAD TO GO DOWN THREE STEPS INTO THE SHOP TOM DID HIS BEST TO SELL ONLY HIS OWN EXCELLENT BUT LIMITED RANGE OF PRODUCE BUT PROGRESS CAME SHOVING THINGS INTO HIS WINDOW
5506-69895-0020 FOREIGN APPLES APPLES FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLES FROM CALIFORNIA APPLES FROM CANADA APPLES FROM NEW ZEALAND PRETTY LOOKIN FRUIT BUT NOT WHAT I SHOULD CALL ENGLISH APPLES SAID TOM BANANAS UNFAMILIAR NUTS
5506-69895-0021 GRAPE FRUITS MANGOES THE MOTOR CARS THAT WENT BY NORTHWARD AND SOUTHWARD GREW MORE AND MORE POWERFUL AND EFFICIENT WHIZZED FASTER AND SMELT WORSE
5506-69895-0022 THERE APPEARED GREAT CLANGOROUS PETROL TROLLEYS DELIVERING COAL AND PARCELS IN THE PLACE OF VANISHING HORSE VANS MOTOR OMNIBUSES OUSTED THE HORSE OMNIBUSES EVEN THE KENTISH STRAWBERRIES GOING LONDONWARD IN THE NIGHT TOOK TO MACHINERY
5506-69895-0023 AND CLATTERED INSTEAD OF CREAKING AND BECAME AFFECTED IN FLAVOUR BY PROGRESS AND PETROL AND THEN YOUNG BERT SMALLWAYS GOT A MOTOR BICYCLE TWO
5506-69895-0024 BERT IT IS NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN WAS A PROGRESSIVE SMALLWAYS NOTHING SPEAKS MORE ELOQUENTLY OF THE PITILESS INSISTENCE OF PROGRESS AND EXPANSION IN OUR TIME THAN THAT IT SHOULD GET INTO THE SMALLWAYS BLOOD
5506-69895-0025 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ADVANCED AND ENTERPRISING ABOUT YOUNG SMALLWAYS BEFORE HE WAS OUT OF SHORT FROCKS HE WAS LOST FOR A WHOLE DAY BEFORE HE WAS FIVE
5506-69895-0026 HE HAD A REAL PISTOL TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM BY A REAL POLICEMAN WHEN HE WAS TEN AND HE LEARNT TO SMOKE NOT WITH PIPES AND BROWN PAPER AND CANE AS TOM HAD DONE BUT WITH A PENNY PACKET OF BOYS OF ENGLAND AMERICAN CIGARETTES HIS LANGUAGE SHOCKED HIS FATHER BEFORE HE WAS TWELVE
5506-69895-0027 AND SPENDING IT ON CHIPS COMIC CUTS ALLY SLOPER'S HALF HOLIDAY CIGARETTES AND ALL THE CONCOMITANTS OF A LIFE OF PLEASURE AND ENLIGHTENMENT ALL OF THIS WITHOUT HINDRANCE TO HIS LITERARY STUDIES WHICH CARRIED HIM UP TO THE SEVENTH STANDARD
5506-69895-0028 AT AN EXCEPTIONALLY EARLY AGE I MENTION THESE THINGS SO THAT YOU MAY HAVE NO DOUBT AT ALL CONCERNING THE SORT OF STUFF BERT HAD IN HIM HE WAS SIX YEARS YOUNGER THAN TOM
5506-69895-0029 AND FOR A TIME THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO UTILISE HIM IN THE GREEN GROCER'S SHOP WHEN TOM AT TWENTY ONE MARRIED JESSICA WHO WAS THIRTY AND HAD SAVED A LITTLE MONEY IN SERVICE BUT IT WAS NOT BERT'S FORTE TO BE UTILISED HE HATED DIGGING
5506-69895-0030 AND WHEN HE WAS GIVEN A BASKET OF STUFF TO DELIVER A NOMADIC INSTINCT AROSE IRRESISTIBLY IT BECAME HIS PACK AND HE DID NOT SEEM TO CARE HOW HEAVY IT WAS NOR WHERE HE TOOK IT SO LONG AS HE DID NOT TAKE IT TO ITS DESTINATION
5506-69895-0031 GLAMOUR FILLED THE WORLD AND HE STRAYED AFTER IT BASKET AND ALL SO TOM TOOK HIS GOODS OUT HIMSELF AND SOUGHT EMPLOYERS FOR BERT WHO DID NOT KNOW OF THIS STRAIN OF POETRY IN HIS NATURE
5506-69895-0032 AND BERT TOUCHED THE FRINGE OF A NUMBER OF TRADES IN SUCCESSION DRAPER'S PORTER CHEMIST'S BOY DOCTOR'S PAGE JUNIOR ASSISTANT GAS FITTER
5506-69895-0033 MILK CART ASSISTANT GOLF CADDIE AND AT LAST HELPER IN A BICYCLE SHOP HERE APPARENTLY HE FOUND THE PROGRESSIVE QUALITY HIS NATURE HAD CRAVED HIS EMPLOYER WAS A PIRATE SOULED YOUNG MAN NAMED GRUBB
5506-69895-0034 WITH A BLACK SMEARED FACE BY DAY AND A MUSIC HALL SIDE IN THE EVENING WHO DREAMT OF A PATENT LEVER CHAIN AND IT SEEMED TO BERT THAT HE WAS THE PERFECT MODEL OF A GENTLEMAN OF SPIRIT
5506-69895-0035 HE HIRED OUT QUITE THE DIRTIEST AND UNSAFEST BICYCLES IN THE WHOLE SOUTH OF ENGLAND AND CONDUCTED THE SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSIONS WITH ASTONISHING VERVE BERT AND HE SETTLED DOWN VERY WELL TOGETHER BERT LIVED IN BECAME ALMOST A TRICK RIDER
5506-69895-0036 HE COULD RIDE BICYCLES FOR MILES THAT WOULD HAVE COME TO PIECES INSTANTLY UNDER YOU OR ME
5506-69895-0037 AND SPENT HIS SURPLUS MONEY UPON REMARKABLE TIES AND COLLARS CIGARETTES AND SHORTHAND CLASSES AT THE BUN HILL INSTITUTE
5506-69895-0038 HE WOULD GO ROUND TO TOM AT TIMES AND LOOK AND TALK SO BRILLIANTLY THAT TOM AND JESSIE WHO BOTH HAD A NATURAL TENDENCY TO BE RESPECTFUL TO ANYBODY OR ANYTHING LOOKED UP TO HIM IMMENSELY
5506-69895-0039 HE'S A GO AHEAD CHAP IS BERT SAID TOM HE KNOWS A THING OR TWO LET'S HOPE HE DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH SAID JESSICA WHO HAD A FINE SENSE OF LIMITATIONS IT'S GO AHEAD TIMES SAID TOM NOO PETATERS AND ENGLISH AT THAT
5506-69895-0040 SEE HIS TIE LAST NIGHT IT WASN'T SUITED TO HIM TOM IT WAS A GENTLEMAN'S TIE HE WASN'T UP TO IT NOT THE REST OF HIM IT WASN'T BECOMING THEN PRESENTLY
5506-69895-0041 BERT GOT A CYCLIST'S SUIT CAP BADGE AND ALL AND TO SEE HIM AND GRUBB GOING DOWN TO BRIGHTON AND BACK HEADS DOWN HANDLE BARS DOWN BACKBONES CURVED WAS A REVELATION IN THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE SMALLWAYS BLOOD
5506-69895-0042 GO AHEAD TIMES OLD SMALLWAYS WOULD SIT OVER THE FIRE MUMBLING OF THE GREATNESS OF OTHER DAYS OF OLD SIR PETER WHO DROVE HIS COACH TO BRIGHTON AND BACK IN EIGHT AND TWENTY HOURS
5506-69895-0043 OF OLD SIR PETER'S WHITE TOP HATS OF LADY BONE WHO NEVER SET FOOT TO GROUND EXCEPT TO WALK IN THE GARDEN OF THE GREAT PRIZE FIGHTS AT CRAWLEY HE TALKED OF PINK AND PIG SKIN BREECHES OF
5506-69895-0044 OF LADY BONE'S CHINTZES AND CRINOLINES NOBODY HEEDED HIM THE WORLD HAD THROWN UP A NEW TYPE OF GENTLEMAN ALTOGETHER A GENTLEMAN OF MOST UNGENTLEMANLY ENERGY A GENTLEMAN IN DUSTY OILSKINS AND MOTOR GOGGLES
5506-69895-0045 AND A WONDERFUL CAP A STINK MAKING GENTLEMAN A SWIFT HIGH CLASS BADGER WHO FLED PERPETUALLY ALONG HIGH ROADS FROM THE DUST AND STINK HE PERPETUALLY MADE AND HIS LADY AS THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE HER AT BUN HILL
5506-69895-0046 WAS A WEATHER BITTEN GODDESS AS FREE FROM REFINEMENT AS A GIPSY
5506-69895-0047 BUT AT LAST HIS SAVINGS ACCUMULATED AND HIS CHANCE CAME THE HIRE PURCHASE SYSTEM BRIDGED A FINANCIAL GAP AND ONE BRIGHT AND MEMORABLE SUNDAY MORNING HE WHEELED HIS NEW POSSESSION THROUGH THE SHOP INTO THE ROAD
5506-69895-0048 GOT ON TO IT WITH THE ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE OF GRUBB AND
5506-69895-0049 TO ADD HIMSELF AS ONE MORE VOLUNTARY PUBLIC DANGER TO THE AMENITIES OF THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND
5506-69895-0050 WHEN I WAS IS AGE I'D NEVER BEEN TO LONDON NEVER BIN SOUTH OF CRAWLEY
5506-69895-0051 AND NOBODY DIDN'T GO NOT UNLESS THEY WAS GENTRY
5506-69895-0052 WONDER THEY ALL GET BACK ORF TO BRIGHTON INDEED
5506-69895-0053 YOU CAN'T SAY I BIN TO BRIGHTON FATHER SAID TOM
5506-69895-0054 CREERING ABOUT AND SPENDIN YOUR MONEY THREE
5506-69895-0055 REGARDLESS OF THE NEW DIRECTION IN WHICH THE STRIVING SOUL OF MAN WAS FINDING EXERCISE AND REFRESHMENT HE FAILED TO OBSERVE THAT THE TYPE OF MOTOR CAR LIKE THE TYPE OF BICYCLE WAS SETTLING DOWN AND LOSING ITS ADVENTUROUS QUALITY
5506-69895-0056 BUT HIS GARDENING MADE HIM ATTENTIVE TO THE HEAVENS AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE BUN HILL GAS WORKS AND THE CRYSTAL PALACE FROM WHICH ASCENTS WERE CONTINUALLY BEING MADE AND PRESENTLY THE DESCENT OF BALLAST UPON HIS POTATOES CONSPIRED TO BEAR IN UPON
5506-69895-0057 HIS UNWILLING MIND THE FACT THAT THE GODDESS OF CHANGE WAS TURNING HER DISTURBING ATTENTION TO THE SKY THE FIRST GREAT BOOM IN AERONAUTICS WAS BEGINNING GRUBB AND BERT HEARD OF IT IN A MUSIC HALL
5506-69895-0058 THEN IT WAS DRIVEN HOME TO THEIR MINDS BY THE CINEMATOGRAPH THEN BERT'S IMAGINATION WAS STIMULATED BY A SIXPENNY EDITION OF THAT AERONAUTIC CLASSIC MISTER GEORGE GRIFFITH'S CLIPPER OF THE CLOUDS AND SO THE THING REALLY GOT HOLD OF THEM
5506-69895-0059 AT FIRST THE MOST OBVIOUS ASPECT WAS THE MULTIPLICATION OF BALLOONS THE SKY OF BUN HILL BEGAN TO BE INFESTED BY BALLOONS ON WEDNESDAY AND SATURDAY AFTERNOONS PARTICULARLY YOU COULD SCARCELY LOOK SKYWARD FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WITHOUT DISCOVERING A BALLOON SOMEWHERE
5506-69895-0060 AND THEN ONE BRIGHT DAY BERT MOTORING TOWARD CROYDON WAS ARRESTED BY THE INSURGENCE OF A HUGE BOLSTER SHAPED MONSTER FROM THE CRYSTAL PALACE GROUNDS AND OBLIGED TO DISMOUNT AND WATCH IT
5506-69895-0061 IT WAS LIKE A BOLSTER WITH A BROKEN NOSE AND BELOW IT AND COMPARATIVELY SMALL WAS A STIFF FRAMEWORK BEARING A MAN AND AN ENGINE WITH A SCREW THAT WHIZZED ROUND IN FRONT AND A SORT OF CANVAS RUDDER BEHIND
5506-69895-0062 THE FRAMEWORK HAD AN AIR OF DRAGGING THE RELUCTANT GAS CYLINDER AFTER IT LIKE A BRISK LITTLE TERRIER TOWING A SHY GAS DISTENDED ELEPHANT INTO SOCIETY THE COMBINED MONSTER CERTAINLY TRAVELLED AND STEERED
5506-69895-0063 IT WENT OVERHEAD PERHAPS A THOUSAND FEET UP BERT HEARD THE ENGINE SAILED AWAY SOUTHWARD VANISHED OVER THE HILLS REAPPEARED A LITTLE BLUE OUTLINE FAR OFF IN THE EAST GOING NOW VERY FAST BEFORE A GENTLE SOUTH WEST GALE
5506-69895-0064 RETURNED ABOVE THE CRYSTAL PALACE TOWERS CIRCLED ROUND THEM CHOSE A POSITION FOR DESCENT AND SANK DOWN OUT OF SIGHT BERT SIGHED DEEPLY AND TURNED TO HIS MOTOR BICYCLE AGAIN AND
5506-69895-0065 CYLINDERS CONES PEAR SHAPED MONSTERS EVEN AT LAST A THING OF ALUMINIUM THAT GLITTERED WONDERFULLY AND THAT GRUBB THROUGH SOME CONFUSION OF IDEAS ABOUT ARMOUR PLATES WAS INCLINED TO CONSIDER A WAR MACHINE
5506-69895-0066 THERE FOLLOWED ACTUAL FLIGHT THIS HOWEVER WAS NOT AN AFFAIR THAT WAS VISIBLE FROM BUN HILL IT WAS SOMETHING THAT OCCURRED IN PRIVATE GROUNDS OR OTHER ENCLOSED PLACES
5506-69895-0067 OR BY CINEMATOGRAPH RECORDS
5506-69895-0068 AND IN THOSE DAYS IF EVER ONE HEARD A MAN SAYING IN A PUBLIC PLACE IN A LOUD REASSURING CONFIDENT TONE IT'S BOUND TO COME THE CHANCES WERE TEN TO ONE HE WAS TALKING OF FLYING AND BERT GOT A BOX LID AND WROTE OUT IN CORRECT WINDOW TICKET STYLE
5506-69895-0069 AND GRUBB PUT IN THE WINDOW THIS INSCRIPTION AEROPLANES MADE AND REPAIRED IT QUITE UPSET TOM IT SEEMED TAKING ONE'S SHOP SO LIGHTLY BUT MOST OF THE NEIGHBOURS
5506-69895-0070 AND ALL THE SPORTING ONES APPROVED OF IT AS BEING VERY GOOD INDEED EVERYBODY TALKED OF FLYING EVERYBODY REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN BOUND TO COME
5506-69895-0071 AND THEN YOU KNOW IT DIDN'T COME THERE WAS A HITCH THEY FLEW THAT WAS ALL RIGHT THEY FLEW IN MACHINES HEAVIER THAN AIR BUT THEY SMASHED SOMETIMES THEY SMASHED THE ENGINE SOMETIMES THEY SMASHED THE AERONAUT USUALLY THEY SMASHED BOTH
5506-69895-0072 MACHINES THAT MADE FLIGHTS OF THREE OR FOUR MILES AND CAME DOWN SAFELY WENT UP THE NEXT TIME TO HEADLONG DISASTER THERE SEEMED NO POSSIBLE TRUSTING TO THEM THE BREEZE UPSET THEM
5506-69895-0073 THE EDDIES NEAR THE GROUND UPSET THEM A PASSING THOUGHT IN THE MIND OF THE AERONAUT UPSET THEM ALSO THEY UPSET SIMPLY IT'S THIS STABILITY DOES EM SAID GRUBB REPEATING HIS NEWSPAPER
5506-69895-0074 EXPERIMENTS FELL AWAY AFTER TWO EXPECTANT YEARS OF THIS SORT OF SUCCESS THE PUBLIC AND THEN THE NEWSPAPERS TIRED OF THE EXPENSIVE PHOTOGRAPHIC REPRODUCTIONS THE OPTIMISTIC REPORTS
5506-69895-0075 THE PERPETUAL SEQUENCE OF TRIUMPH AND DISASTER AND SILENCE FLYING SLUMPED EVEN BALLOONING FELL AWAY TO SOME EXTENT
5506-69895-0076 THOUGH IT REMAINED A FAIRLY POPULAR SPORT AND CONTINUED TO LIFT GRAVEL FROM THE WHARF OF THE BUN HILL GAS WORKS AND DROP IT UPON DESERVING PEOPLE'S LAWNS AND GARDENS THERE WERE HALF A DOZEN REASSURING YEARS FOR TOM AT LEAST SO FAR AS FLYING WAS CONCERNED
5506-69895-0077 BUT THAT WAS THE GREAT TIME OF MONO RAIL DEVELOPMENT AND HIS ANXIETY WAS ONLY DIVERTED FROM THE HIGH HEAVENS BY THE MOST URGENT THREATS AND SYMPTOMS OF CHANGE IN THE LOWER SKY THERE HAD BEEN TALK OF MONO RAILS FOR SEVERAL YEARS
5506-69895-0078 BUT THE REAL MISCHIEF BEGAN WHEN BRENNAN SPRANG HIS GYROSCOPIC MONO RAIL CAR UPON THE ROYAL SOCIETY IT WAS THE LEADING SENSATION OF THE NINETEEN O SEVEN SOIREES THAT CELEBRATED DEMONSTRATION ROOM WAS ALL TOO SMALL FOR ITS EXHIBITION
5506-69895-0079 BRAVE SOLDIERS LEADING ZIONISTS DESERVING NOVELISTS NOBLE LADIES CONGESTED THE NARROW PASSAGE AND THRUST DISTINGUISHED ELBOWS INTO RIBS THE WORLD WOULD NOT WILLINGLY LET BREAK DEEMING THEMSELVES FORTUNATE
5506-69895-0080 IF THEY COULD SEE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF THE RAIL INAUDIBLE BUT CONVINCING THE GREAT INVENTOR EXPOUNDED HIS DISCOVERY AND SENT HIS OBEDIENT LITTLE MODEL OF THE TRAINS OF THE FUTURE UP GRADIENTS ROUND CURVES AND ACROSS A SAGGING WIRE
5506-69895-0081 IT RAN ALONG ITS SINGLE RAIL ON ITS SINGLE WHEELS SIMPLE AND SUFFICIENT IT STOPPED REVERSED STOOD STILL BALANCING PERFECTLY
5506-69895-0082 IT MAINTAINED ITS ASTOUNDING EQUILIBRIUM AMIDST A THUNDER OF APPLAUSE THE AUDIENCE DISPERSED AT LAST DISCUSSING HOW FAR THEY WOULD ENJOY CROSSING AN ABYSS ON A WIRE CABLE SUPPOSE THE GYROSCOPE STOPPED
5506-69895-0083 IN A FEW YEARS THEY REALISED BETTER IN A LITTLE WHILE NO ONE THOUGHT ANYTHING OF CROSSING AN ABYSS ON A WIRE AND THE MONO RAIL WAS SUPERSEDING THE TRAM LINES RAILWAYS AND INDEED EVERY FORM OF TRACK FOR MECHANICAL LOCOMOTION
5506-69895-0084 ALONG MADE TRACKS UPON THE GROUND
5506-69895-0085 TOM COULD THINK OF NOTHING MORE STRIKING TO SAY OF HIM THAN THAT WHEN HE WAS A BOY THERE WASN'T NOTHING HIGHER THAN YOUR CHIMBLEYS THERE WASN'T A WIRE NOR A CABLE IN THE SKY OLD SMALLWAYS WENT TO HIS GRAVE UNDER AN INTRICATE NETWORK OF WIRES AND CABLES
5506-69895-0086 FOR BUN HILL BECAME NOT ONLY A SORT OF MINOR CENTRE OF POWER DISTRIBUTION THE HOME COUNTIES POWER DISTRIBUTION COMPANY SET UP TRANSFORMERS AND A GENERATING STATION CLOSE BESIDE THE OLD GAS WORKS BUT ALSO A JUNCTION ON THE SUBURBAN MONO RAIL SYSTEM
5506-69895-0087 MOREOVER EVERY TRADESMAN IN THE PLACE AND INDEED NEARLY EVERY HOUSE HAD ITS OWN TELEPHONE THE MONO RAIL CABLE STANDARD BECAME A STRIKING FACT IN URBAN LANDSCAPE FOR THE MOST PART STOUT IRON ERECTIONS RATHER LIKE TAPERING TRESTLES
5506-69895-0088 AND PAINTED A BRIGHT BLUISH GREEN ONE IT HAPPENED BESTRODE TOM'S HOUSE WHICH LOOKED STILL MORE RETIRING AND APOLOGETIC BENEATH ITS IMMENSITY AND ANOTHER GIANT STOOD JUST INSIDE THE CORNER OF HIS GARDEN
5506-69895-0089 WHICH WAS STILL NOT BUILT UPON AND UNCHANGED EXCEPT FOR A COUPLE OF ADVERTISEMENT BOARDS ONE RECOMMENDING A TWO AND SIXPENNY WATCH AND ONE A NERVE RESTORER THESE BY THE BYE WERE PLACED ALMOST HORIZONTALLY TO CATCH THE EYE OF THE PASSING MONO RAIL PASSENGERS ABOVE
5506-69895-0090 AND SO SERVED ADMIRABLY TO ROOF OVER A TOOL SHED AND A MUSHROOM SHED FOR TOM ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT THE FAST CARS FROM BRIGHTON AND HASTINGS WENT MURMURING BY OVERHEAD
5506-69895-0091 LONG BROAD COMFORTABLE LOOKING CARS THAT WERE BRIGHTLY LIT AFTER DUSK AS THEY FLEW BY AT NIGHT TRANSIENT FLARES OF LIGHT AND A RUMBLING SOUND OF PASSAGE THEY KEPT UP A PERPETUAL SUMMER LIGHTNING
5506-69895-0092 AND THUNDERSTORM IN THE STREET BELOW PRESENTLY THE ENGLISH CHANNEL WAS BRIDGED A SERIES OF GREAT IRON EIFFEL TOWER PILLARS CARRYING MONO RAIL CABLES AT A HEIGHT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE WATER
5506-69895-0093 EXCEPT NEAR THE MIDDLE WHERE THEY ROSE HIGHER TO ALLOW THE PASSAGE OF THE LONDON AND ANTWERP SHIPPING AND THE HAMBURG AMERICA LINERS THEN HEAVY MOTOR CARS BEGAN TO RUN ABOUT ON ONLY A COUPLE OF WHEELS ONE BEHIND THE OTHER
5506-69895-0094 WHICH FOR SOME REASON UPSET TOM DREADFULLY AND MADE HIM GLOOMY FOR DAYS AFTER THE FIRST ONE PASSED THE SHOP ALL THIS GYROSCOPIC AND MONO RAIL DEVELOPMENT NATURALLY ABSORBED A VAST AMOUNT OF PUBLIC ATTENTION
5506-69895-0095 AND THERE WAS ALSO A HUGE EXCITEMENT CONSEQUENT UPON THE AMAZING GOLD DISCOVERIES OFF THE COAST OF ANGLESEA MADE BY A SUBMARINE PROSPECTOR MISS PATRICIA GIDDY
5506-69895-0096 SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE REEFS CROPPING UP AGAIN UNDER THE WATER SHE HAD SET HERSELF TO VERIFY THIS SUPPOSITION BY THE USE OF THE SUBMARINE CRAWLER INVENTED BY DOCTOR ALBERTO CASSINI
5506-69895-0097 BY A HAPPY MINGLING OF REASONING AND INTUITION PECULIAR TO HER SEX SHE FOUND GOLD AT HER FIRST DESCENT AND EMERGED AFTER THREE HOURS SUBMERSION WITH ABOUT TWO HUNDREDWEIGHT OF ORE CONTAINING GOLD
5506-69895-0098 IN THE UNPARALLELED QUANTITY OF SEVENTEEN OUNCES TO THE TON BUT THE WHOLE STORY OF HER SUBMARINE MINING INTENSELY INTERESTING AS IT IS MUST BE TOLD AT SOME OTHER TIME
