8527-281131-0006 INFORMED HIS MEN THAT HE WAS GOING TO NEW MEXICO THE HOMEWARD ROUTE WAS THROUGH MOST OF THE COUNTRY OVER WHICH THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY TRAVELED THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY HAVING BEEN COMPLETED THE PARTY STARTED
8527-281131-0007 AND THENCE THROUGH TO THE PEUBLO OF LOS ANGELOS
8527-281131-0008 CALLED SO BECAUSE THEY ARE INHABITED BY INDIANS WHO BEAR THAT NAME THESE ARE THE TRUE DESCENDANTS OF THE ANCIENT AZTECS WHO WERE ONCE THE SUBJECTS OF THE MONTEZUMAS THEY ARE USUALLY A QUIET AND INDUSTRIOUS RACE
8527-281131-0009 ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLES FORMS AND CEREMONIES OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH THEY HAVE NOT FAILED TO INHERIT THE SUPERSTITION OF THEIR FOREFATHERS NOT WITHSTANDING THE CHANGES WHICH TIME
8527-281131-0010 WITH ITS COHORTS OF EMIGRATION BOOKS RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS ASSOCIATION WITH OTHER RACES MECHANICS SCIENCE AND ART IN GREATER OR LESS DEGREE HAS INTRODUCED INTO THEIR COUNTRY AND ACCOMPLISHED UNDER THEIR EYES THEY STILL BELIEVE THAT
8527-281131-0011 SOME DAY THEIR GREAT CHIEF WILL RETURN TO THEM ACCORDINGLY IN EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEIR TOWNS
8527-281131-0012 IN ORDER ON HIS ADVENT TO LET HIM KNOW WHERE HIS CHILDREN LIVE AT LOS ANGELOS THE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES CAME TO THE TRAPPERS AND DEMANDED THEIR PASSPORTS
8527-281131-0013 ON FINDING THAT SUCH ARTICLES OF PAPER AUTHORITY DID NOT FORM ANY PART OF A TRAPPER'S OUTFIT THEY DETERMINED TO ARREST THEM
8527-281131-0014 FAIR AND LEGITIMATE MEANS WERE THEREFORE LAID ASIDE AND A FOUL POLICY ADOPTED
8527-281131-0015 THUS ATTACKING THEM IN A WEAK POINT WHEN THEY SHOULD BECOME FULLY INEBRIATED THEY CONSIDERED THE MATTER OF THEIR ARREST BOTH EASY AND CERTAIN MISTER YOUNG SEEING THE INTENTIONS OF THE AUTHORITIES AND THEIR UNDERHANDED METHOD OF CARRYING THEM OUT
8527-281131-0016 DETERMINED TO THWART THEM HE DIRECTED CARSON TO TAKE THREE MEN THE LOOSE ANIMALS AND THE CAMP EQUIPAGE AND MOVE ON WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT IF HE DID NOT SOON JOIN HIM TO PUSH ON THAT IF HE DID NOT EVENTUALLY OVERTAKE HIM
8527-281131-0017 TO REPORT IN NEW MEXICO THAT THE MAIN PARTY HAD BEEN MASSACRED YOUNG SUCCEEDED IN COLLECTING HIS MEN AS BEST HE COULD FOR THEY WERE YET SUFFICIENTLY SOBER TO RETAIN A LITTLE OF THEIR REASON
8527-281131-0018 THE TREACHEROUS MEXICANS HOWEVER CONTINUED ANNOYING THE COMMANDER OF THE TRAPPERS BY GRATUITOUSLY OFFERING THE MEN ALL THE LIQUOR THEY DESIRED ONE BY ONE THE TRAPPERS WERE ALLOWING THEMSELVES TO BE EASILY CONQUERED AS THE EFFECTS OF THE LIQUOR BEGAN TO BE MORE ACTIVE
8527-281131-0019 THEY WOULD SOON HAVE FALLEN A COMPLETE PREY TO THEIR ENEMIES HAD NOT A MOST SINGULAR CIRCUMSTANCE PUT THE MEXICANS TO FLIGHT ONE OF THE TRAPPERS NAMED JAMES HIGGINS WITHOUT ANY PROVOCATION AND WITHOUT ANY EXCUSE EXCEPT THAT HE WAS INTOXICATED
8527-281131-0020 SHOT A MAN NAMED JAMES LAWRENCE INFLICTING A SLIGHT WOUND SUCH CONDUCT SO TERRIFIED THE MEXICANS THAT THEY TOOK SUDDEN AND PRECIPITOUS LEAVE THIS HAPPENED VERY FORTUNATELY BEFORE THE PARTY ARRIVED AT THE MISSION OF SAN GABRIEL
8527-281131-0021 AND PERHAPS KILLED BY THE MEXICANS AIDED BY PARTIES AND REINFORCEMENTS AT THE MISSION ABOUT DARK YOUNG BY URGING HIS HALF DRUNKEN MEN INTO A FORCED MARCH SUCCEEDED IN OVERTAKING CARSON
8527-281131-0022 THEY WENT INTO CAMP A NIGHT OF SLEEP SOON SET THE BRAINS OF YOUNG'S TRAPPERS ONCE MORE TO RIGHTS THE NEXT DAY THE PARTY
8527-281131-0023 COMMENCED WITH VIGOR THE HOMEWARD MARCH THEY CONTINUED NINE DAYS ALMOST UPON THEIR FORMER TRACK WHEN OUTWARD BOUND ON THE NINTH DAY THEY ONCE MORE STOOD ON THE BANKS OF THE COLORADO RIVER WHILE ENCAMPED ON THIS STREAM
8527-281131-0024 A BAND OF FIVE HUNDRED INDIANS MADE THEIR APPEARANCE AND ENTERED THE CAMP THE RASCALS PROFESSED THE GREATEST FRIENDSHIP FOR THE TRAPPERS BUT THEIR ACTIONS NOT FULLY MEASURING THEIR WORDS THE WHITE MEN LOOKED TO CARSON FOR ADVICE
8527-281131-0025 HE HAD DISCOVERED THAT BENEATH THEIR ARTICLES OF DRESS THEIR WEAPONS WERE VERY CAREFULLY CONCEALED AND FROM THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IT BECAME QUITE CLEARLY APPARENT THE INDIANS INTENDED TO MASSACRE THE ENTIRE PARTY HERE CARSON'S BOLDNESS PROVED AS IT HAD BEFORE
8527-281131-0026 AND DID MANY A TIME AFTERWARDS THE SAFETY OF HIMSELF AND FRIENDS OR ASSOCIATES AT THE TIME THE INDIANS ENTERED THE CAMP CARSON WITH ONLY A FEW OF THE PARTY OCCUPIED IT THE REST WERE OUT VISITING THEIR TRAPS
8527-281131-0027 WHICH IT WAS THEIR GENERAL CUSTOM TO SET WHENEVER THEY ARRIVED AT A SUITABLE STREAM
8527-281131-0028 AND FEELING THAT THE SALVATION OF THE ENTIRE PARTY RESTED UPON HIS COURAGE AND WISDOM MADE UP HIS MIND THAT BOLDNESS WAS THE WISEST POLICY HE COULD ADOPT HE FOUND PRESENT AMONG THE WARRIORS ONE WHO COULD SPEAK THE SPANISH LANGUAGE
8527-281131-0029 WITHOUT FURTHER PARLEY COMMENCE HOSTILITIES
8527-281131-0030 AND CONSEQUENTLY WERE TAKEN COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE AT KIT'S UNUSUAL BOLDNESS SEEING THAT THEY WOULD INEVITABLY LOSE SEVERAL OF THEIR BRAVES IF THEY MADE ANY HOSTILE DEMONSTRATION THEY CHOSE THE DISCREET PART OF BEST POLICY AND DEPARTED
8527-281131-0031 AS A GENERAL RULE NO MATTER WHAT THE PROFIT OR URGENT NECESSITY WHICH CHANCE OFFERS
8527-281131-0032 A SHORT SEARCH SUFFICED TO DISCOVER THE INDIAN CAMP
8527-281131-0033 THE INDIANS WERE SO COMPLETELY TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT THEY BECAME PANIC STRUCK AND FLED IN EVERY DIRECTION THEY HOWEVER RALLIED SOMEWHAT AND A RUNNING FIGHT COMMENCED WHICH LASTED SOME TIME BUT WHICH DID NOT CHANGE MATTERS IN FAVOR OF THE INDIANS
8527-281131-0034 THE ENTIRE HERD FELL INTO THE POSSESSION OF THE TRAPPERS ON THE SAME EVENING AFTER THE MEN HAD WRAPPED THEMSELVES UP IN THEIR BLANKETS AND LAID DOWN FOR A SLEEP AND WHILE ENJOYING THEIR SLUMBERS A NOISE REACHED THEIR EARS WHICH SOUNDED VERY MUCH LIKE DISTANT THUNDER
8527-281131-0035 BUT A CLOSE APPLICATION OF THE SENSE OF HEARING SHOWED PLAINLY THAT AN ENEMY WAS NEAR AT HAND SPRINGING UP WITH RIFLE IN HAND FOR GENERALLY IN THE MOUNTAINS A MAN'S GUN RESTS IN THE SAME BLANKET WITH HIMSELF ON ALL SLEEPING OCCASIONS THEY SALLIED FORTH TO RECONNOITRE
8527-281131-0036 AND DISCOVERED A FEW WARRIORS DRIVING ALONG A BAND OF AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED HORSES THE TRAPPERS COMPREHENDED INSTANTLY THAT THE WARRIORS HAD BEEN TO THE MEXICAN SETTLEMENTS IN SONORA ON A THIEVING EXPEDITION AND THAT THE HORSES HAD CHANGED HANDS WITH ONLY ONE PARTY TO THE BARGAIN
8527-281131-0037 THE OPPORTUNITY TO INSTILL A LESSON ON THE SAVAGE MARAUDERS WAS TOO GOOD TO BE LOST THEY SALUTED THE THIEVES WITH A VOLLEY FROM THEIR RIFLES WHICH WITH THE BULLET WHIZZING ABOUT THEIR HEADS AND BODIES SO ASTONISHED THEM THAT THEY SEEMED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TO FORGET THEIR STOLEN PROPERTY AND TO THINK ONLY OF A PRECIPITOUS FLIGHT
8527-281131-0038 TO RETURN THE ANIMALS TO THEIR OWNERS WAS AN IMPOSSIBILITY MISTER YOUNG THEREFORE SELECTED AS MANY OF THE BEST HORSES AS HE NEEDED FOR HIMSELF AND MEN AND GAME BEING VERY SCARCE KILLED TWO AND DRIED MOST OF THE MEAT FOR FUTURE USE TURNING THE REMAINDER LOOSE
8527-281131-0039 SUCH EITHER BECAME WILD MUSTANGS OR FELL AGAIN INTO THE CLUTCHES OF THE INDIANS THE COMPANY THEN RENEWED THEIR TRAPPING AND CONTINUED IT UP THE GILA TO A POINT OPPOSITE THE COPPER MINES OF NEW MEXICO HERE THEY LEFT THE RIVER AND PROCEEDED TO THE COPPER MINES
8527-281131-0040 THESE MINES WERE NOT THEN AND EVER SINCE HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED THE HOLES WHICH HAD MANY YEARS BEFORE BEEN MADE BY THE MINERS BUT WHO THEY WERE IS UNKNOWN FORMED A SAFE HIDING PLACE FOR THEIR SKINS THE STOCK OF BEAVER WAS THEREFORE PLACED UNDER THE CARE OF MISTER MC KNIGHT
8527-281131-0041 YOUNG AND HIS MEN THEN RENEWED THEIR MARCH AND IN DUE TIME ARRIVED SAFELY AT SANTA FE HERE THEY PURCHASED LICENSES TO TRADE WITH THE INDIANS WHO LIVE ABOUT THE COPPER MINES WITH THESE LICENSES AS PROTECTION PAPERS THEY RETURNED TO WHERE THE SKINS WERE CONCEALED
8527-281131-0042 THEY HAVE PROVED A KNOTTY HISTORICAL PROBLEM TO MANY AN INVESTIGATING MIND FOR THEIR AUTHENTIC HISTORY HAS FALLEN AND PROBABLY WILL EVER REMAIN IN OBLIVION IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT ABOUT A CENTURY AGO THE SPANIARDS WITH INDIAN ASSISTANTS WORKED THEM
8527-281131-0043 THERE IS A LEGENDARY STORY CIRCULATING SIMILAR TO THE TRADITIONS OF THE INDIANS GIVING THIS EXPLANATION THE MORE PROBABLE HYPOTHESIS HOWEVER IS THAT THE INDIANS THEMSELVES MANY CENTURIES IN THE PAST WERE VERSED TO SOME EXTENT IN THE ART OF MINING
8527-281131-0044 AND CARRIED ON THE BUSINESS IN THESE MINES BUT FROM INDOLENCE OR TO THEM USELESSNESS OF THE METALS THE WORK WAS ABANDONED AND THEIR DESCENDANTS FAILED TO OBTAIN THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH THEIR ANCESTORS POSSESSED
8527-281131-0045 THESE MINES AND THOSE WHICH EXIST NEARER TO THE LARGE TOWNS WILL SOME DAY RENDER NEW MEXICO A PROFITABLE AND RICH FIELD FOR THE LEARNED ANTIQUARY THE RUSE WHICH MISTER YOUNG FOUND ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO EMPLOY IN ORDER TO BLIND THE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES
8527-281131-0046 SUCCEEDED SO WELL THAT WHEN THE FUR ARRIVED AT SANTA FE EVERY ONE CONSIDERED THE TRAPPERS HAD MADE A VERY GOOD TRADE THE AMOUNT OF BEAVER THUS BROUGHT IN AMOUNTED TO TWO THOUSAND POUNDS THE MARKET PRICE WAS TWELVE DOLLARS THE POUND
8527-281131-0047 THE PROCEEDS THEREFORE OF THE ENTIRE TRIP WERE NEARLY TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS THE DIVISION OF THIS HANDSOME SUM GAVE TO EACH MAN SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS IT WAS DURING THE MONTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY THAT MISTER YOUNG'S PARTY AGAIN REACHED THE TOWN OF TAOS
8527-281131-0048 HERE THEY DISBANDED HAVING COMPLETED THEIR ENTERPRISE LIKE AS JACK WHEN HE RETURNS FROM HIS BATTLES WITH OLD OCEAN HAVING A POCKET WELL LINED WITH HARD EARNINGS FAILS NOT TO PLUNGE INTO EXCESS
8527-281131-0049 WITH THE DETERMINATION TO MAKE UP FOR THE PLEASURE LOST BY YEARS OF TOIL THE BRAVE MOUNTAINEERS COURTED MERRYMAKING FROM THEIR OWN ACCOUNTS THEY PASSED A SHORT TIME GLORIOUSLY
8527-281131-0050 THIS SIMILARITY OF DISPOSITION BETWEEN TRAPPERS AND SAILORS IN REGARD TO PLEASURE'S SYREN CUP AND ITS CONSEQUENT DRAFT UPON THEIR TREASURES CAUSING THEM TO FORGET THE RISK OF LIFE AND LIMB AND THE EXPENSE OF THEIR VALUABLE TIME IS MOST REMARKABLE THESE HARDY TRAPPERS
8527-281131-0051 LIKE RELIABLE OLD SALTS PROVED TO BE AS TRUE TO THE BOWL AS THEY HAD BEEN TO THEIR STEEL FOR MOST OF THE PARTY IN A VERY BRIEF SPACE OF TIME WERE PENNILESS AND READY TO BE FITTED OUT FOR ANOTHER EXPEDITION YOUNG KIT AT THIS PERIOD OF HIS LIFE
8527-281131-0052 IMITATED THE EXAMPLE SET BY HIS ELDERS FOR HE WISHED TO BE CONSIDERED BY THEM AS AN EQUAL AND A FRIEND HE HOWEVER PASSED THROUGH THIS TERRIBLE ORDEAL WHICH MOST FREQUENTLY RUINS ITS VOTARY AND EVENTUALLY CAME OUT BRIGHTER
8527-281131-0053 CLEARER AND MORE NOBLE FOR THE CONSCIENCE POLISH WHICH HE RECEIVED HE CONTRACTED NO BAD HABITS BUT LEARNED THE USEFULNESS AND HAPPINESS OF RESISTING TEMPTATION AND BECAME SO WELL SCHOOLED THAT HE WAS ABLE
8527-281131-0054 BY THE CAUTION AND ADVICE OF WISDOM FOUNDED ON EXPERIENCE TO PREVENT MANY A PROMISING AND SKILLFUL HAND FROM GRASPING RUIN IN THE SAME VORTEX THE SCENES OF PLEASURE LASTED UNTIL THE FALL OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY KIT THEN JOINED HIS SECOND TRAPPING EXPEDITION
8527-281131-0055 THIS BAND HAD BEEN FORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRAPPING THE PRINCIPAL STREAMS OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS MISTER FITZPATRICK A TRAPPER WELL KNOWN AND RESPECTED BY THE MOUNTAINEERS HAD CHARGE OF THE PARTY HE WAS AT THAT TIME
8527-281131-0056 WELL ACQUAINTED BY EXPERIENCE WITH THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS AND HAS SINCE THEN GAINED AN ENVIABLE FAME AS AN INDIAN AGENT THE NEW PARTY TRAVELLED NORTH AND COMMENCED OPERATIONS ON THE PLATTE RIVER WHICH THEY FOLLOWED DOWN STREAM TO ONE OF ITS TRIBUTARIES THE SWEET WATER RIVER
8527-281131-0057 WHO HAD LEFT TAOS SOME DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THE MAIN BODY AND FOR WHOM THEY WERE THEN HUNTING THE WHOLE PARTY AS NOW ORGANIZED REMAINED WHERE THEY WERE THROUGHOUT THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY AND EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE EMPLOYED IN KILLING ONLY THE AMOUNT OF GAME NECESSARY FOR THEIR SUSTENANCE
8527-281131-0058 AN UNFORTUNATE AFFAIR HERE HAPPENED TO THEM FOUR OF THEIR MEN WHILE HUNTING BUFFALO WERE ATTACKED AND KILLED BY A PARTY OF BLACKFEET INDIANS NO OTHER INCIDENT OCCURRED DURING THE WINTER TO CHANGE THE EVERYDAY ROUTINE IN APRIL OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE THEY RECOMMENCED TRAPPING
8527-281131-0059 SHAPING THEIR COURSE FOR BEAR RIVER THIS IS THE PRINCIPAL STREAM THAT EMPTIES INTO GREAT SALT LAKE THENCE THEY RETURNED TO GREEN RIVER WHERE THEY FOUND SOME TRAPPERS UNDER THE COMMAND OF MISTER SINCLAIR
8527-281131-0060 AMONG MANY OTHER FACTS THEY LEARNED FROM THIS PARTY THAT CAPTAIN GAUNT WHO WAS AN OLD MOUNTAINEER WELL KNOWN TO MOST OF THE WHITES PRESENT HAD PASSED THE WINTER ON THE LARAMIE RIVER AND THAT HE WAS THEN WITH HIS MEN IN THE NEW PARK
8527-281131-0061 KIT CARSON AND FOUR OF HIS COMPANIONS DETERMINED TO JOIN HIM FOR THIS PURPOSE THEY STARTED AND AFTER TEN DAYS OF STEADY TRAVEL FOUND HIS PARTY THERE ARE TWO OF THESE NATURAL PARKS IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS TO DISTINGUISH THEM THEY ARE CALLED THE OLD PARK AND THE NEW PARK
8527-281131-0062 AS THEIR NAMES IMPLY THEY ARE FAIR NATURAL EXAMPLES OF THE MANUFACTURED PARKS OF CIVILIZATION IN SOME THINGS NATURE HAS LAVISHED UPON THEM CHARMS AND BEAUTIES WHICH NO HUMAN SKILL CAN IMITATE
8527-281131-0063 KIT AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE GRACIOUSLY RECEIVED BY GAUNT AND WITH HIM THEY TRAPPED THE STREAMS IN THE VICINITY OF THE NEW PARK AND THE PLAINS OF LARAMIE TO THE SOUTH FORK OF THE PLATTE HAVING FINISHED HERE THEY LEFT FOR THE ARKANSAS
8527-281131-0064 REMAINING THERE WHILE THEIR CAPTAIN WENT TO TAOS TO DISPOSE OF THEIR STOCK OF FURS AND TO MAKE SUCH PURCHASES OF NECESSARIES AS THE MEN REQUIRED GAUNT RETURNED AFTER AN ABSENCE OF TWO MONTHS WHEN TRAPPING OPERATIONS WERE RESUMED ON THE ARKANSAS RIVER
8527-281131-0065 WHICH THEY TRAPPED UNTIL IT FROZE OVER THE PARTY THEN WENT INTO WINTER QUARTERS THE BUSINESS OF TRAPPING FOR BEAVER IS NO CHILD'S PLAY A PERSON UNACCUSTOMED TO IT MAY POSSIBLY LOOK UPON IT AS NO VERY DIFFICULT TASK
8527-281131-0066 A SINGLE TRIAL IS USUALLY SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY THE UNINITIATED ON THIS POINT FOR THE BEAVER ABOVE ALL OTHER WILD ANIMALS OF AMERICA IS ENDOWED WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF INSTINCT HIS HANDIWORK AND HABITS SUFFICIENTLY ATTEST THIS
8527-281131-0067 THERE ARE BANDS OF INDIANS LIVING IN THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF AMERICA WHO REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE BEAVER HAS ALMOST AS MUCH INTELLIGENCE AS AN INDIAN HOLDING AND MAINTAINING THAT ALL THE DIFFERENCE THAT EXISTS BETWEEN A BEAVER AND AN INDIAN IS
8527-281131-0068 THAT THE LATTER HAS BEEN ENDOWED BY THE GREAT SPIRIT WITH POWER AND CAPABILITIES TO CATCH THE FORMER SOME OF THE STORIES WHICH OLD MOUNTAINEERS OCCASIONALLY INFLICT UPON AN INQUISITIVE TRAVELLER ARE SOMEWHAT STARTLING NEVERTHELESS
8527-281131-0069 WHAT THIS AMPHIBIOUS ANIMAL REALLY PERFORMS IS TRULY ASTOUNDING AND OFTENTIMES THE TRUTH FAILS TO GAIN CREDENCE DURING THE WINTER THE TRAPPERS HAD MANY VERY PLEASANT TIMES FOR THEY HAD LITTLE WORK BEYOND THE TASK OF MAKING THEMSELVES COMFORTABLE
8527-281131-0070 THE SNOW FELL TO A GREAT DEPTH WHICH PROVED RATHER HARD FOR THEIR ANIMALS BY DINT OF CUTTING DOWN COTTONWOOD TREES AND GATHERING THE BARK AND BRANCHES FOR FODDER THEY MANAGED TO PREVENT THEM FROM DYING OF STARVATION
8527-281131-0071 THE BUFFALO EXISTED ABOUT THERE IN GREAT ABUNDANCE AND EARLY IN THE WINTER THEY HAD TAKEN THE PRECAUTION TO KILL AND PREPARE A LARGE SUPPLY OF THIS KIND OF GAME WHILE IT WAS IN GOOD CONDITION
