1421-8539-0000 MISTER ELLIOT WAS ATTENDING HIS TWO COUSINS AND MISSUS CLAY THEY WERE IN MILSOM STREET
1421-8539-0001 BUT ENOUGH TO MAKE SHELTER DESIRABLE FOR WOMEN AND QUITE ENOUGH TO MAKE IT VERY DESIRABLE FOR MISS ELLIOT TO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING CONVEYED HOME IN LADY DALRYMPLE'S CARRIAGE WHICH WAS SEEN WAITING AT A LITTLE DISTANCE SHE ANNE AND MISSUS CLAY THEREFORE TURNED INTO MOLLAND'S
1421-8539-0002 WHILE MISTER ELLIOT STEPPED TO LADY DALRYMPLE TO REQUEST HER ASSISTANCE HE SOON JOINED THEM AGAIN SUCCESSFUL OF COURSE LADY DALRYMPLE WOULD BE MOST HAPPY TO TAKE THEM HOME AND WOULD CALL FOR THEM IN A FEW MINUTES
1421-8539-0003 HER LADYSHIP'S CARRIAGE WAS A BAROUCHE AND DID NOT HOLD MORE THAN FOUR WITH ANY COMFORT MISS CARTERET WAS WITH HER MOTHER CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS NOT REASONABLE TO EXPECT ACCOMMODATION FOR ALL THE THREE CAMDEN PLACE LADIES THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT AS TO MISS ELLIOT
1421-8539-0004 WHOEVER SUFFERED INCONVENIENCE SHE MUST SUFFER NONE BUT IT OCCUPIED A LITTLE TIME TO SETTLE THE POINT OF CIVILITY BETWEEN THE OTHER TWO THE RAIN WAS A MERE TRIFLE AND ANNE WAS MOST SINCERE IN PREFERRING A WALK WITH MISTER ELLIOT
1421-8539-0005 SHE WOULD HARDLY ALLOW IT EVEN TO DROP AT ALL AND HER BOOTS WERE SO THICK MUCH THICKER THAN MISS ANNE'S AND IN SHORT HER CIVILITY RENDERED HER QUITE AS ANXIOUS TO BE LEFT TO WALK WITH MISTER ELLIOT AS ANNE COULD BE AND IT WAS DISCUSSED BETWEEN THEM WITH A GENEROSITY SO POLITE AND SO DETERMINED
1421-8539-0006 THAT THE OTHERS WERE OBLIGED TO SETTLE IT FOR THEM MISS ELLIOT MAINTAINING THAT MISSUS CLAY HAD A LITTLE COLD ALREADY AND MISTER ELLIOT DECIDING ON APPEAL THAT HIS COUSIN ANNE'S BOOTS WERE RATHER THE THICKEST IT WAS FIXED ACCORDINGLY
1421-8539-0007 AND THEY HAD JUST REACHED THIS POINT WHEN ANNE AS SHE SAT NEAR THE WINDOW DESCRIED MOST DECIDEDLY AND DISTINCTLY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WALKING DOWN THE STREET HER START WAS PERCEPTIBLE ONLY TO HERSELF
1421-8539-0008 SHE WAS LOST AND WHEN SHE HAD SCOLDED BACK HER SENSES SHE FOUND THE OTHERS STILL WAITING FOR THE CARRIAGE AND MISTER ELLIOT ALWAYS OBLIGING JUST SETTING OFF FOR UNION STREET ON A COMMISSION OF MISSUS CLAY'S SHE NOW FELT A GREAT INCLINATION TO GO TO THE OUTER DOOR SHE WANTED TO SEE IF IT RAINED
1421-8539-0009 WHY WAS SHE TO SUSPECT HERSELF OF ANOTHER MOTIVE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH MUST BE OUT OF SIGHT SHE LEFT HER SEAT SHE WOULD GO
1421-8539-0010 OR ALWAYS SUSPECTING THE OTHER OF BEING WORSE THAN IT WAS SHE WOULD SEE IF IT RAINED SHE WAS SENT BACK HOWEVER IN A MOMENT BY THE ENTRANCE OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HIMSELF AMONG A PARTY OF GENTLEMEN AND LADIES EVIDENTLY HIS ACQUAINTANCE AND WHOM HE MUST HAVE JOINED A LITTLE BELOW MILSOM STREET
1421-8539-0011 HE WAS MORE OBVIOUSLY STRUCK AND CONFUSED BY THE SIGHT OF HER THAN SHE HAD EVER OBSERVED BEFORE HE LOOKED QUITE RED
1421-8539-0012 SHE HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF HIM IN THE PREPARATION OF THE LAST FEW MOMENTS ALL THE OVERPOWERING BLINDING BEWILDERING FIRST EFFECTS OF STRONG SURPRISE WERE OVER WITH HER STILL HOWEVER SHE HAD ENOUGH TO FEEL IT WAS AGITATION PAIN PLEASURE
1421-8539-0013 A SOMETHING BETWEEN DELIGHT AND MISERY HE SPOKE TO HER AND THEN TURNED AWAY THE CHARACTER OF HIS MANNER WAS EMBARRASSMENT SHE COULD NOT HAVE CALLED IT EITHER COLD OR FRIENDLY OR ANYTHING SO CERTAINLY AS EMBARRASSED
1421-8539-0014 MUTUAL ENQUIRIES ON COMMON SUBJECTS PASSED NEITHER OF THEM PROBABLY MUCH THE WISER FOR WHAT THEY HEARD AND ANNE CONTINUING FULLY SENSIBLE OF HIS BEING LESS AT EASE THAN FORMERLY
1421-8539-0015 THEY HAD BY DINT OF BEING SO VERY MUCH TOGETHER GOT TO SPEAK TO EACH OTHER WITH A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF APPARENT INDIFFERENCE AND CALMNESS BUT HE COULD NOT DO IT NOW TIME HAD CHANGED HIM OR LOUISA HAD CHANGED HIM THERE WAS CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOME SORT OR OTHER
1421-8539-0016 HE LOOKED VERY WELL NOT AS IF HE HAD BEEN SUFFERING IN HEALTH OR SPIRITS AND HE TALKED OF UPPERCROSS OF THE MUSGROVES NAY EVEN OF LOUISA AND HAD EVEN A MOMENTARY LOOK OF HIS OWN ARCH SIGNIFICANCE AS HE NAMED HER BUT YET IT WAS CAPTAIN WENTWORTH NOT COMFORTABLE
1421-8539-0017 NOT EASY NOT ABLE TO FEIGN THAT HE WAS IT DID NOT SURPRISE BUT IT GRIEVED ANNE TO OBSERVE THAT ELIZABETH WOULD NOT KNOW HIM SHE SAW THAT HE SAW ELIZABETH THAT ELIZABETH SAW HIM THAT THERE WAS COMPLETE INTERNAL RECOGNITION ON EACH SIDE
1421-8539-0018 SHE WAS CONVINCED THAT HE WAS READY TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS AN ACQUAINTANCE EXPECTING IT AND SHE HAD THE PAIN OF SEEING HER SISTER TURN AWAY WITH UNALTERABLE COLDNESS LADY DALRYMPLE'S CARRIAGE FOR WHICH MISS ELLIOT WAS GROWING VERY IMPATIENT NOW DREW UP
1421-8539-0019 THE SERVANT CAME IN TO ANNOUNCE IT IT WAS BEGINNING TO RAIN AGAIN AND ALTOGETHER THERE WAS A DELAY AND A BUSTLE AND A TALKING WHICH MUST MAKE ALL THE LITTLE CROWD IN THE SHOP UNDERSTAND THAT LADY DALRYMPLE WAS CALLING TO CONVEY MISS ELLIOT
1421-8539-0020 WERE WALKING OFF AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WATCHING THEM TURNED AGAIN TO ANNE AND BY MANNER RATHER THAN WORDS WAS OFFERING HIS SERVICES TO HER I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU WAS HER ANSWER BUT I AM NOT GOING WITH THEM THE CARRIAGE WOULD NOT ACCOMMODATE SO MANY I WALK
1421-8539-0021 I PREFER WALKING BUT IT RAINS OH VERY LITTLE NOTHING THAT I REGARD
1421-8539-0022 THOUGH I CAME ONLY YESTERDAY I HAVE EQUIPPED MYSELF PROPERLY FOR BATH ALREADY YOU SEE POINTING TO A NEW UMBRELLA I WISH YOU WOULD MAKE USE OF IT IF YOU ARE DETERMINED TO WALK THOUGH I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE PRUDENT TO LET ME GET YOU A CHAIR
1421-8539-0023 SHE WAS VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM BUT DECLINED IT ALL REPEATING HER CONVICTION THAT THE RAIN WOULD COME TO NOTHING AT PRESENT AND ADDING I AM ONLY WAITING FOR MISTER ELLIOT
1421-8539-0024 SHE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN THE WORDS WHEN MISTER ELLIOT WALKED IN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH RECOLLECTED HIM PERFECTLY THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND THE MAN WHO HAD STOOD ON THE STEPS AT LYME ADMIRING ANNE AS SHE PASSED EXCEPT IN THE AIR AND LOOK AND MANNER OF THE PRIVILEGED RELATION AND FRIEND
1421-8539-0025 HE CAME IN WITH EAGERNESS APPEARED TO SEE AND THINK ONLY OF HER
1421-8539-0026 AND ANXIOUS TO GET HER AWAY WITHOUT FURTHER LOSS OF TIME AND BEFORE THE RAIN INCREASED AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT THEY WALKED OFF TOGETHER HER ARM UNDER HIS A GENTLE AND EMBARRASSED GLANCE AND A GOOD MORNING TO YOU BEING ALL THAT SHE HAD TIME FOR AS SHE PASSED AWAY
1421-8539-0027 AS SOON AS THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT THE LADIES OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S PARTY BEGAN TALKING OF THEM MISTER ELLIOT DOES NOT DISLIKE HIS COUSIN I FANCY OH NO THAT IS CLEAR ENOUGH ONE CAN GUESS WHAT WILL HAPPEN THERE HE IS ALWAYS WITH THEM HALF LIVES IN THE FAMILY I BELIEVE
1421-8539-0028 WHAT A VERY GOOD LOOKING MAN YES AND MISS ATKINSON WHO DINED WITH HIM ONCE AT THE WALLISES SAYS HE IS THE MOST AGREEABLE MAN SHE EVER WAS IN COMPANY WITH SHE IS PRETTY I THINK ANNE ELLIOT VERY PRETTY WHEN ONE COMES TO LOOK AT HER
1421-8539-0029 IT IS NOT THE FASHION TO SAY SO BUT I CONFESS I ADMIRE HER MORE THAN HER SISTER
1421-8539-0030 AND SO DO I NO COMPARISON BUT THE MEN ARE ALL WILD AFTER MISS ELLIOT ANNE IS TOO DELICATE FOR THEM
1421-8539-0031 IF HE WOULD HAVE WALKED BY HER SIDE ALL THE WAY TO CAMDEN PLACE WITHOUT SAYING A WORD
1421-8539-0032 THOUGH NOTHING COULD EXCEED HIS SOLICITUDE AND CARE AND THOUGH HIS SUBJECTS WERE PRINCIPALLY SUCH AS WERE WONT TO BE ALWAYS INTERESTING
1421-8539-0033 AND INSINUATIONS HIGHLY RATIONAL AGAINST MISSUS CLAY BUT JUST NOW SHE COULD THINK ONLY OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIS PRESENT FEELINGS WHETHER HE WERE REALLY SUFFERING MUCH FROM DISAPPOINTMENT OR NOT AND TILL THAT POINT WERE SETTLED SHE COULD NOT BE QUITE HERSELF
1421-8539-0034 SHE HOPED TO BE WISE AND REASONABLE IN TIME BUT ALAS ALAS SHE MUST CONFESS TO HERSELF THAT SHE WAS NOT WISE YET
1421-8539-0035 WAS HOW LONG HE MEANT TO BE IN BATH HE HAD NOT MENTIONED IT OR SHE COULD NOT RECOLLECT IT HE MIGHT BE ONLY PASSING THROUGH BUT IT WAS MORE PROBABLE THAT HE SHOULD BE COME TO STAY IN THAT CASE SO LIABLE AS EVERY BODY WAS TO MEET EVERY BODY IN BATH
1421-8539-0036 LADY RUSSELL WOULD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD SEE HIM SOMEWHERE WOULD SHE RECOLLECT HIM HOW WOULD IT ALL BE SHE HAD ALREADY BEEN OBLIGED TO TELL LADY RUSSELL THAT LOUISA MUSGROVE WAS TO MARRY CAPTAIN BENWICK IT HAD COST HER SOMETHING TO ENCOUNTER LADY RUSSELL'S SURPRISE
1421-8539-0037 AND NOW IF SHE WERE BY ANY CHANCE TO BE THROWN INTO COMPANY WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HER IMPERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF THE MATTER MIGHT ADD ANOTHER SHADE OF PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM THE FOLLOWING MORNING ANNE WAS OUT WITH HER FRIEND AND FOR THE FIRST HOUR IN AN INCESSANT AND FEARFUL SORT OF WATCH FOR HIM IN VAIN
1421-8539-0038 BUT AT LAST IN RETURNING DOWN PULTENEY STREET SHE DISTINGUISHED HIM ON THE RIGHT HAND PAVEMENT AT SUCH A DISTANCE AS TO HAVE HIM IN VIEW THE GREATER PART OF THE STREET THERE WERE MANY OTHER MEN ABOUT HIM MANY GROUPS WALKING THE SAME WAY BUT THERE WAS NO MISTAKING HIM SHE LOOKED INSTINCTIVELY AT LADY RUSSELL
1421-8539-0039 BUT NOT FROM ANY MAD IDEA OF HER RECOGNISING HIM SO SOON AS SHE DID HERSELF NO IT WAS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT LADY RUSSELL WOULD PERCEIVE HIM TILL THEY WERE NEARLY OPPOSITE SHE LOOKED AT HER HOWEVER FROM TIME TO TIME ANXIOUSLY AND WHEN THE MOMENT APPROACHED WHICH MUST POINT HIM OUT
1421-8539-0040 SHE WAS YET PERFECTLY CONSCIOUS OF LADY RUSSELL'S EYES BEING TURNED EXACTLY IN THE DIRECTION FOR HIM OF HER BEING IN SHORT INTENTLY OBSERVING HIM SHE COULD THOROUGHLY COMPREHEND THE SORT OF FASCINATION HE MUST POSSESS OVER LADY RUSSELL'S MIND
1421-8539-0041 THE DIFFICULTY IT MUST BE FOR HER TO WITHDRAW HER EYES THE ASTONISHMENT SHE MUST BE FEELING THAT EIGHT OR NINE YEARS SHOULD HAVE PASSED OVER HIM AND IN FOREIGN CLIMES AND IN ACTIVE SERVICE TOO WITHOUT ROBBING HIM OF ONE PERSONAL GRACE
1421-8539-0042 AT LAST LADY RUSSELL DREW BACK HER HEAD NOW HOW WOULD SHE SPEAK OF HIM YOU WILL WONDER SAID SHE WHAT HAS BEEN FIXING MY EYE SO LONG BUT I WAS LOOKING AFTER SOME WINDOW CURTAINS WHICH LADY ALICIA AND MISSUS FRANKLAND WERE TELLING ME OF LAST NIGHT
1421-8539-0043 AS BEING THE HANDSOMEST AND BEST HUNG OF ANY IN BATH BUT COULD NOT RECOLLECT THE EXACT NUMBER AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND OUT WHICH IT COULD BE BUT I CONFESS I CAN SEE NO CURTAINS HEREABOUTS THAT ANSWER THEIR DESCRIPTION ANNE SIGHED
1421-8539-0044 AND BLUSHED AND SMILED IN PITY AND DISDAIN EITHER AT HER FRIEND OR HERSELF THE PART WHICH PROVOKED HER MOST WAS THAT IN ALL THIS WASTE OF FORESIGHT AND CAUTION SHE SHOULD HAVE LOST THE RIGHT MOMENT FOR SEEING WHETHER HE SAW THEM
1421-8539-0045 A DAY OR TWO PASSED WITHOUT PRODUCING ANYTHING THE THEATRE OR THE ROOMS WHERE HE WAS MOST LIKELY TO BE WERE NOT FASHIONABLE ENOUGH FOR THE ELLIOTS WHOSE EVENING AMUSEMENTS WERE SOLELY IN THE ELEGANT STUPIDITY OF PRIVATE PARTIES IN WHICH THEY WERE GETTING MORE AND MORE ENGAGED
1421-8539-0046 AND ANNE WEARIED OF SUCH A STATE OF STAGNATION SICK OF KNOWING NOTHING AND FANCYING HERSELF STRONGER BECAUSE HER STRENGTH WAS NOT TRIED WAS QUITE IMPATIENT FOR THE CONCERT EVENING IT WAS A CONCERT FOR THE BENEFIT OF A PERSON PATRONISED BY LADY DALRYMPLE OF COURSE THEY MUST ATTEND
1421-8539-0047 IT WAS REALLY EXPECTED TO BE A GOOD ONE AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS VERY FOND OF MUSIC IF SHE COULD ONLY HAVE A FEW MINUTES CONVERSATION WITH HIM AGAIN SHE FANCIED SHE SHOULD BE SATISFIED AND AS TO THE POWER OF ADDRESSING HIM SHE FELT ALL OVER COURAGE IF THE OPPORTUNITY OCCURRED
1421-8539-0048 ELIZABETH HAD TURNED FROM HIM LADY RUSSELL OVERLOOKED HIM HER NERVES WERE STRENGTHENED BY THESE CIRCUMSTANCES SHE FELT THAT SHE OWED HIM ATTENTION
