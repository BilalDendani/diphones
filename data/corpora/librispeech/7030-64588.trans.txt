7030-64588-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN AFLOAT ON THE NAPO DOWN THE RAPIDS
7030-64588-0001 PRATT ON DISCIPLINE FOREST MUSIC COCA OUR CRAFT AND CREW STORM ON THE NAPO
7030-64588-0002 WE EMBARKED NOVEMBER TWENTIETH ON OUR VOYAGE DOWN THE RIVER IT IS NO EASY MATTER TO HIRE OR CAJOLE THE INDIANS FOR ANY SERVICE OUT OF FEAST TIME
7030-64588-0003 THEY ARE OUT OF TOWN AND DURING THE FESTIVAL THEY ARE LOTH TO LEAVE OR ARE SO FULL OF CHICHA THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WANT
7030-64588-0004 BY SHOWING HIM THE PRESIDENT'S ORDER AND THEN USED HIM TO ENTICE OR TO COMPEL WE KNOW NOT HIS MOTIVE POWER EIGHT INDIANS INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR TO TAKE US TO SANTA ROSA WE PAID THEM ABOUT TWENTY FOUR YARDS OF LIENZO
7030-64588-0005 THEY FURNISHED THREE CANOES TWO FOR BAGGAGE AND ONE COVERED WITH A PALM LEAF AWNING FOR OURSELVES THE CANOES WERE OF RED CEDAR AND FLAT BOTTOMED THE PADDLES HAD OVAL BLADES TO WHICH SHORT
7030-64588-0006 QUICK STROKES WERE GIVEN PERPENDICULARLY TO THE WATER ENTERING AND LEAVING BUT THERE WAS LITTLE NEED OF PADDLING ON THIS TRIP THE NAPO STARTS OFF IN FURIOUS HASTE FOR THE FALL BETWEEN NAPO VILLAGE AND SANTA ROSA
7030-64588-0007 A DISTANCE OF EIGHTY MILES IS THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET WE WERE ABOUT SEVEN HOURS IN THE VOYAGE DOWN AND IT TAKES SEVEN DAYS TO POLE BACK THE PASSAGE OF THE RAPIDS IS DANGEROUS TO ALL BUT AN INDIAN
7030-64588-0008 AS WALLACE SAYS OF A SPOT ON THE RIO NEGRO YOU ARE BEWILDERED BY THE CONFLICTING MOTIONS OF THE WATER WHIRLING AND BOILING EDDIES BURST AS IF FROM SOME SUBAQUEOUS EXPLOSION
7030-64588-0009 AND AN UP CURRENT ON THE OTHER NOW A CROSS STREAM AT THE BOWS AND A DIAGONAL ONE AT THE STERN WITH A FOAMING SCYLLA ON YOUR RIGHT AND A WHIRLING CHARYBDIS ON THE LEFT BUT OUR NERVOUSNESS GAVE WAY TO ADMIRATION
7030-64588-0010 AS OUR POPERO OR PILOT THE SEDATE GOVERNOR GAVE THE CANOE A SHEER WITH THE SWOOP OF HIS LONG PADDLE TURNING IT GRACEFULLY AROUND THE CORNER OF A ROCK AGAINST WHICH IT SEEMED WE MUST BE DASHED AND WE FELT LIKE JOINING IN THE WILD SCREAM OF THE INDIANS
7030-64588-0011 AS OUR LITTLE CRAFT SHOT LIKE AN ARROW PAST THE DANGER AND DOWN THE RAPIDS AND DANCED ON THE WATERS BELOW IN FOUR HOURS WE WERE ABREAST THE LITTLE VILLAGE OF AGUANO ON THE OPPOSITE BANK WE COULD SEE THE TAMBOS
7030-64588-0012 OF THE GOLD WASHERS AT FIVE P M WE REACHED THE DESERTED SITE OF OLD SANTA ROSA THE VILLAGE HAVING BEEN REMOVED A FEW YEARS AGO ON ACCOUNT OF ITS UNHEALTHY LOCATION
7030-64588-0013 IT IS NOW OVERGROWN WITH SOUR ORANGE AND CALABASH TREES THE LATTER BEARING LARGE FRUIT SHELLS SO USEFUL TO THE INDIANS IN MAKING PILCHES OR CUPS IN PITCH DARKNESS AND IN A DRIZZLING RAIN
7030-64588-0014 WE ARRIVED AT NEW SANTA ROSA AND SWUNG OUR HAMMOCKS IN THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE SANTA ROSA ONCE THE PROSPEROUS CAPITAL OF THE PROVINCIA DEL ORIENTE NOW CONTAINS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN
7030-64588-0015 THE TOWN IS PLEASANTLY SITUATED ON THE LEFT BANK OF THE RIVER ABOUT FIFTEEN FEET ABOVE THE WATER LEVEL A LITTLE BAMBOO CHURCH OPEN ONLY WHEN THE MISSIONARY FROM ARCHIDONA MAKES HIS ANNUAL VISIT
7030-64588-0016 STOOD NEAR OUR QUARTERS THE INDIANS WERE KEEPING ONE OF THEIR SEVEN FEASTS IN A HUT NEAR BY AND THEIR DRUMMING WAS THE LAST THING WE HEARD AS WE TURNED INTO OUR HAMMOCKS AND THE FIRST IN THE MORNING
7030-64588-0017 IS THE ONLY WHITE INHABITANT AND HE IS AN INDIAN IN EVERY RESPECT SAVE SPEECH AND COLOR HIS HABITATION IS ONE OF THE LARGEST STRUCTURES ON THE NAPO THE POSTS ARE OF CHONTA PALM THE SIDES AND ROOF OF THE USUAL MATERIAL
7030-64588-0018 SPLIT BAMBOO AND PALM LEAVES IT IS EMBOWERED IN A MAGNIFICENT GROVE OF PLANTAINS AND PAPAYAS IN THE SPACIOUS VESTIBULE IS A BENCH ON WHICH THE INDIAN GOVERNOR AND HIS STAFF SEAT THEMSELVES EVERY MORNING
7030-64588-0019 TO CONFER WITH THE ALCALDE IN ONE CORNER STANDS A TABLE THE ONLY ONE WE REMEMBER SEEING ON THE NAPO ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE ARE HEAPED UP JARS POTS KETTLES HUNTING AND FISHING IMPLEMENTS PADDLES
7030-64588-0020 BOWS AND ARROWS BETWEEN THE POSTS SWING TWO CHAMBIRI HAMMOCKS FROM SANTA ROSA TO PARA THE HAMMOCK ANSWERS FOR CHAIR SOFA TETE A TETE AND BED WHEN A STRANGER ENTERS
7030-64588-0021 AND AT SANTA ROSA WE WERE ALWAYS PRESENTED WITH A CUP OF GUAYUSA IN BRAZIL WITH A CUP OF COFFEE SANDOVAL WORE NOTHING BUT SHIRT AND PANTALOONS THE DIGNITY OF THE BAREFOOTED FUNCTIONARY
7030-64588-0022 WAS CONFINED TO HIS SPANISH BLOOD HE HAD LIVED LONG AMONG THE ZAPAROS AND FROM HIM HIS DAUGHTER AND A ZAPARO SERVANT WE OBTAINED MUCH VALUABLE INFORMATION RESPECTING THAT WILD
7030-64588-0023 THIS WAS NOT EASILY DONE THE INDIANS SEEMED RELUCTANT TO QUIT THEIR FEASTS AND GO ON SUCH A LONG VOYAGE
7030-64588-0024 AND MANUFACTURED A HOST OF LIES AND EXCUSES HE DECLARED THERE WAS BUT ONE LARGE CANOE IN TOWN AND THAT WE MUST SEND TO SUNO FOR ANOTHER AND FOR MEN TO MAN IT THERE WERE INDEED FEW INDIANS IN SANTA ROSA
7030-64588-0025 FOR WHILE WE WERE DISPUTING A LARGO NUMBER WENT OFF WITH SHOUTINGS DOWN THE RIVER TO SPEND WEEKS IN THE FOREST HUNTING MONKEYS
7030-64588-0026 IN THE DEPTHS OF THE NAPO WILDERNESS STARTING ON A MONKEY CRUSADE BUT IT WAS STILL MORE STIRRING TO THINK OF PADDLING OUR OWN CANOE DOWN TO BRAZIL AFTER SOME TIME LOST IN WORD FIGHTING WE TRIED THE VIRTUES OF AUTHORITY
7030-64588-0027 WE PRESENTED THE PRESIDENT'S ORDER WHICH COMMANDED ALL CIVIL AND MILITARY POWERS ON THE NAPO TO AID AND NOT TO HINDER THE EXPEDITION
7030-64588-0028 SANDOVAL WAS ANOTHER MAN AND THE TWO CANOES AND FOUR INDIANS WE WANTED WERE FORTHCOMING WE HAD TO WAIT HOWEVER TWO DAYS FOR THE INDIANS TO PREPARE THEIR CHICHA FOR THE JOURNEY AND TO COVER THE CANOES WITH PALM AWNINGS
7030-64588-0029 THE PRICE OF A CANOE FOR THE MARANON IS TWENTY FIVE VARAS OF LIENZO AND THE SAME FOR EACH INDIAN UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD ONLY FIFTY VARAS LEFT BUT THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF THE NOW GOOD NATURED ALCALDE
7030-64588-0030 WE INDUCED THE INDIANS TO TAKE THE BALANCE IN COIN AFTER MANY DELAYS WE PUT OUR BAGGAGE INTO ONE CANOE AND OURSELVES INTO THE OTHER AND PUSHED OFF INTO THE RAPID CURRENT OF THE NAPO
7030-64588-0031 WE HAD THREE STYLES OF VALEDICTION ON LEAVING OUR INDIAN QUARTET AFTER SEVERAL LAST DRINKS OF CHICHA BADE THEIR FRIENDS FAREWELL BY CLASPING HANDS ONE KISSING THE JOINED HANDS AND THEN THE OTHER
7030-64588-0032 SANDOVAL MUTTERED ADIOS IN REPLY TO OURS MEANING NO DOUBT GOOD RIDDANCE WHILE WE SHOUTED A HEARTY GOOD BYE TO EDWARDS AS HE PUSHED HIS WAY UP STREAM TO CONTINUE HIS LONELY BUT CHOSEN INDIAN LIFE ON THE BANKS OF THE YUSUPINO
7030-64588-0033 THE NAPO AT SANTA ROSA RUNS AT LEAST FIVE MILES AN HOUR AND WE WERE SOON PICKING OUR WAY NOW DRIFTING NOW PADDLING THROUGH A LABYRINTH OF ISLANDS AND SNAGS
7030-64588-0034 THE INDIANS SO ACCUSTOMED TO BRUTAL VIOLENCE FROM THE HANDS OF THE WHITES HAD BEGGED OF US BEFORE OUR DEPARTURE THAT WE WOULD NOT BEAT THEM BUT SHORTLY AFTER WE LEFT ONE OF THEM WHO WAS LITERALLY FILLED WITH CHICHA
7030-64588-0035 DROPPED HIS PADDLE AND TUMBLED INTO A HEAP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CANOE DEAD DRUNK PRATT OUR GIGANTIC MISSISSIPPI BOATMAN WHOM WE HAD ENGAGED AT QUITO AS CAPTAIN AND COOK DOWN THE RIVER AND WHO WAS AN AWFUL GOLIATH IN THE EYES OF THE RED SKINS
7030-64588-0036 SEIZED THE FELLOW AND GAVE HIM A TERRIBLE SHAKING THE LIKE OF WHICH WAS NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF IN ALL NAPO AT ONCE THE LIQUOR LEFT THE MUDDLED BRAIN OF THE ASTONISHED CULPRIT AND TAKING HIS PADDLE HE BECAME FROM THAT HOUR THE BEST OF THE CREW
7030-64588-0037 THIS WAS THE ONLY CASE OF DISCIPLINE ON THE VOYAGE ALWAYS OBSEQUIOUS THEY OBEYED US WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING NONE OF THEM COULD SPEAK SPANISH SO WE HAD PROVIDED OURSELVES WITH A VOCABULARY
7030-64588-0038 BUT SOME ENGLISH WORDS LIKE THE IMPERATIVE PADDLE WERE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE TONGUE OF THE INCAS INDEED WHEN WE MIXED UP OUR QUICHUA WITH A LITTLE ANGLO SAXON THEY EVIDENTLY THOUGHT THE LATTER
7030-64588-0039 WAS A TERRIBLE ANATHEMA FOR THEY SPRANG TO THEIR PLACES WITHOUT DELAY IN SEVEN HOURS WE ARRIVED AT SUNO A COLLECTION OF HALF A DOZEN PALM BOOTHS FIVE FEET HIGH THE MISERABLE OWNERS OF WHICH DO A LITTLE FISHING AND GOLD WASHING
7030-64588-0040 THEY GAVE US POSSESSION OF THEIR LARGEST HUT IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN ROASTING A SEA COW AND THE STENCH WAS INTOLERABLE NEVERTHELESS ONE OF OUR NUMBER BRAVELY THREW DOWN HIS BLANKET WITHIN AND WENT TO SLEEP
7030-64588-0041 TWO SWUNG THEIR HAMMOCKS BETWEEN THE TREES AND THE REST SLEPT IN THE CANOE HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE LEAVING GUAYAQUIL WE WERE TORMENTED BY MUSQUITOES BATS WERE ALSO QUITE NUMEROUS BUT NONE OF THEM WERE BLOOD THIRSTY
7030-64588-0042 AND WE MAY ADD THAT NOWHERE IN SOUTH AMERICA WERE WE TROUBLED BY THOSE DIABOLICAL IMPS OF IMAGINATIVE TRAVELERS THE LEAF NOSED SPECIES SO FAR AS OUR EXPERIENCE GOES WE CAN SAY WITH BATES THAT THE VAMPIRE
7030-64588-0043 SO COMMON ON THE AMAZON IS THE MOST HARMLESS OF ALL BATS IT HAS HOWEVER A MOST HIDEOUS PHYSIOGNOMY A FULL GROWN SPECIMEN WILL MEASURE TWENTY EIGHT INCHES IN EXPANSE OF WING
7030-64588-0044 THE VOICE OF THE LATTER SOUNDS LIKE THE CRACKING OF WOOD OCCASIONALLY FROGS OWLS AND GOAT SUCKERS CROAK HOOT AND WAIL BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND THREE A M ALMOST PERFECT SILENCE REIGNS
7030-64588-0045 AT EARLY DAWN THE ANIMAL CREATION AWAKES WITH A SCREAM PRE EMINENT ARE THE DISCORDANT CRIES OF MONKEYS AND MACAWS AS THE SUN RISES HIGHER ONE MUSICIAN AFTER ANOTHER SEEKS THE FOREST SHADE
7030-64588-0046 AND THE MORNING CONCERT ENDS AT NOON IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY THERE IS AN ALL PERVADING RUSTLING SOUND CAUSED BY THE FLUTTERING OF MYRIAD INSECTS AND THE GLIDING OF LIZARDS AND SNAKES AT SUNSET
7030-64588-0047 PARROTS AND MONKEYS RESUME THEIR CHATTER FOR A SEASON AND THEN GIVE WAY TO THE NOISELESS FLIGHT OF INNUMERABLE BATS CHASING THE HAWK MOTH AND BEETLE THERE IS SCARCELY A SOUND IN A TROPICAL FOREST WHICH IS JOYOUS AND CHEERING
7030-64588-0048 THE BIRDS ARE USUALLY SILENT THOSE THAT HAVE VOICES UTTER A PLAINTIVE SONG OR HOARSE SHRILL CRY OUR DOOR YARDS ARE FAR MORE MELODIOUS ON A MAY MORNING THE MOST COMMON BIRDS ON THE NAPO
7030-64588-0049 ARE MACAWS PARROTS TOUCANS AND CIGANAS THE PARROTS LIKE THE MAJORITY IN SOUTH AMERICA ARE OF THE GREEN TYPE THE TOUCAN PECULIAR TO THE NEW WORLD AND DISTINGUISHED BY ITS ENORMOUS BILL
7030-64588-0050 IS A QUARRELSOME IMPERIOUS BIRD IT IS CLUMSY IN FLIGHT BUT NIMBLE IN LEAPING FROM LIMB TO LIMB IT HOPS ON THE GROUND LIKE A ROBIN AND MAKES A SHRILL YELPING PIA PO O CO
7030-64588-0051 ECUADORIANS CALL IT THE PREDICADOR OR PREACHER BECAUSE IT WAGS ITS HEAD LIKE A PRIEST AND SEEMS TO SAY GOD GAVE IT YOU
7030-64588-0052 ORANGE AND ROSE COLORS AND THE ROBES OF THE ROYAL DAMES OF EUROPE
7030-64588-0053 WERE TRIMMED WITH THEM THE CIGANA OR GYPSY IN PERU CALLED CHANSU RESEMBLES A PHEASANT THE FLESH HAS A MUSKY ODOR AND IT IS FOR THIS REASON PERHAPS THAT THEY EXIST IN SUCH NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
7030-64588-0054 THE INDIANS NEVER EAT THEM IN NO COUNTRY AS IN THE AMAZONIAN VALLEY IS THERE SUCH A VARIETY OF INSECTS NOWHERE DO WE FIND SPECIES OF LARGER SIZE OR GREATER BEAUTY
7030-64588-0055 IT IS THE RICHEST LOCALITY FOR BUTTERFLIES BATES FOUND TWELVE HUNDRED SPECIES IN BRAZIL ALONE
7030-64588-0056 THE SPLENDID METALLIC BLUE AND THE YELLOW AND TRANSPARENT WINGED ARE VERY ABUNDANT ON THE NAPO SOME RISE HIGH IN THE AIR OTHERS LIVING IN SOCIETIES LOOK LIKE FLUTTERING CLOUDS MOTHS ARE COMPARATIVELY RARE
7030-64588-0057 THE MOST CONSPICUOUS BEETLE ON THE RIVER IS A MAGNIFICENT GREEN SPECIES CHRYSOPHORA CHRYSOCHLORA ALWAYS FOUND ARBOREAL LIKE THE MAJORITY OF TROPICAL COLEOPTERS THEY LOOK LIKE EMERALD GEMS CLINGING TO THE BRANCHES
7030-64588-0058 WHICH THE NAPOS NAME RESPECTIVELY
7030-64588-0059 CORN HONEY IT IS SINGULAR THESE INDIANS HAVE NO TERM FOR BEES BUT CALL THEM HONEY AND DISTINGUISH THEM BY THEIR COLOR THE BLACK SPECIES IS SAID TO MAKE THE MOST HONEY AND THE YELLOW THE BEST
7030-64588-0060 THE QUADRUPEDS OF THE ORIENTE ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN IN THE DRY SEASON NOT A SLOTH NOR ARMADILLO DID WE SEE BUT WHEN THE RAINS DESCEND THE WILDERNESS IS A MENAGERIE OF TIGERS AND TAPIRS PUMAS AND BEARS
7030-64588-0061 WHILE A HOST OF REPTILES LED BY THE GIGANTIC BOA CREEP FORTH FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES THE MOST FEROCIOUS CARNIVORES ARE FOUND IN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE MOST VENOMOUS SERPENTS HAUNT THE LOWLANDS
7030-64588-0062 DARWIN SAYS THAT WE OUGHT NOT TO EXPECT ANY CLOSER SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE ORGANIC BEINGS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ANDES THAN ON THE OPPOSITE SHORES OF THE OCEAN WE WILL REMARK THAT WE OBTAINED A PECCARI
7030-64588-0063 A NUMBER OF BIRDS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO HIGH FLIGHTS AND FIVE REPTILIAN SPECIES ON THE PACIFIC SLOPE IDENTICAL WITH SPECIES FOUND ON THE NAPO BREAKFASTING ON FRIED YUCAS ROASTED PLANTAINS FISH AND GUAYUSA
7030-64588-0064 WE SET SAIL ARRIVING AT COCA AT TWO P M THIS LITTLE VILLAGE THE LAST WE SHALL SEE TILL WE COME WITHIN SIGHT OF THE AMAZON IS BEAUTIFULLY LOCATED ON THE RIGHT BANK TWENTY FIVE FEET ABOVE THE RIVER
7030-64588-0065 AND OPPOSITE THE CONFLUENCE OF THE RIO COCA THOUGH FOUNDED TWENTY YEARS AGO IT CONTAINS ONLY FIVE OR SIX BAMBOO HUTS A GOVERNMENT HOUSE CHURCH ALCALDE'S RESIDENCE
7030-64588-0066 FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF AGUARDIENTE AND SIRUP FROM THE CANE
7030-64588-0067 WHO SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME SWINGING IN A HAMMOCK SLUNG BETWEEN THE POSTS OF HIS VERANDA AND PLAYING WITH A TAME PARROT WHEN NOT DRUNK OR ASLEEP THIS SPOT IS MEMORABLE IN HISTORY
7030-64588-0068 AND THE COCA HALTED AND BUILT A RAFT OR CANOE PRESCOTT SAYS A BRIG IN WHICH ORELLANA WAS SENT DOWN THE RIVER TO RECONNOITRE BUT WHO NEVER RETURNED
7030-64588-0069 BUT AFTER RECEIVING THE COCA IT TURNS TO THE SOUTHEAST WE REMAINED HERE TWO DAYS TO CONSTRUCT A MORE COMFORTABLE CRAFT FOR OUR VOYAGE TO THE AMAZON A DISTANCE OF AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED MILES
7030-64588-0070 AND PLANTED FOUR STOUT CHONTA STICKS TO SUPPORT A PALM THATCHED ROOF A RUDDER A NOVEL IDEA TO OUR RED SKINNED COMPANIONS AND A BOX OF SAND IN THE STERN OF ONE OF THE BOATS FOR A FIRE PLACE COMPLETED OUR RIG
7030-64588-0071 WITH A HICCOUGH DECLARED WE WOULD BE FOREVER GOING DOWN THE RIVER IN SUCH A HUGE CRAFT AND THE INDIANS SMILED OMINOUSLY BUT WHEN OUR GALLANT SHIP LEFT COCA OBEDIENTLY TO THE HELM AND AT THE RATE OF SIX MILES AN HOUR WHEN PADDLES AND CURRENT WORKED TOGETHER
7030-64588-0072 THEY SHOUTED BUENO OUR TRUNKS AND PROVISION CANS WERE ARRANGED ALONG THE TWO SIDES OF THE PLATFORM SO THAT WE HAD ABUNDANCE OF FROM FOR EXERCISE BY DAY AND FOR SLEEPING UNDER MUSQUITO TENTS AT NIGHT A LITTLE CANOE
7030-64588-0073 WHICH WE BOUGHT OF THE ALCALDE FLOATED ALONGSIDE FOR A TENDER AND WAS VERY SERVICEABLE IN HUNTING GATHERING FUEL ET CETERA IN THE FORECASTLE THE BOWS OF THE LARGE CANOES WHICH PROJECTED BEYOND OUR CABIN SAT THREE INDIANS TO PADDLE
7030-64588-0074 THE FOURTH WHO WAS THE GOVERNOR OF SANTA ROSA WE HONORED WITH THE POST OF STEERSMAN AND HE WAS ALWAYS TO BE SEEN ON THE POOP BEHIND THE KITCHEN STANDING BOLT UPRIGHT ON THE ALERT AND ON THE LOOKOUT ON APPROACHING ANY HUMAN HABITATION
7030-64588-0075 THE INDIANS BLEW HORNS TO INDICATE THAT THEY CAME AS FRIENDS THESE HORNS MUST HAVE COME FROM BRAZIL AS THERE ARE NO BOVINES ON THE NAPO
7030-64588-0076 THEY BLOW THEIR HORNS ALSO TO CHARM THE YACU MAMA OR MOTHER OF WATERS AS THEY CALL THE IMAGINARY SERPENT AT DIFFERENT POINTS DOWN THE RIVER THEY DEPOSITED POTS OF CHICHA FOR USE ON THEIR RETURN
7030-64588-0077 THE MASS BREEDS WORMS SO RAPIDLY HOWEVER AS EDWARDS INFORMED US THAT AFTER THE LAPSE OF A MONTH OR TWO IT IS A JUMBLE OF YUCA SCRAPS AND WRITHING ARTICULATES BUT THE OWNER OF THE HEAP COOLLY SEPARATES THE ANIMAL FROM THE VEGETABLE
7030-64588-0078 ADDS A LITTLE WATER AND DRINKS HIS CHICHA WITHOUT CEREMONY DURING LEISURE HOURS THE INDIANS BUSIED THEMSELVES PLAITING PALM LEAVES INTO ORNAMENTS FOR THEIR ARMS AND HEADS NOT A NOTE DID THEY WHISTLE OR SING
7030-64588-0079 YET THEY WERE ALWAYS IN GOOD HUMOR AND DURING THE WHOLE VOYAGE
7030-64588-0080 AT NO TIME DID WE HAVE THE LEAST FEAR OF TREACHERY OR VIOLENCE THE NAPOS ARE NOT SAVAGES THEIR GOODNESS HOWEVER AS BATES SAYS OF THE CUCAMA TRIBE CONSISTS MORE IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTIVE BAD QUALITIES
7030-64588-0081 THAN IN THE POSSESSION OF GOOD ONES OF AN APATHETIC TEMPERAMENT AND DULL IMAGINATION WE COULD NOT STIR THEM INTO ADMIRATION OR ENTHUSIASM BY ANY SCIENTIFIC WONDER THE UTMOST MANIFESTATION OF SURPRISE WAS A CLUCK WITH THE TONGUE
7030-64588-0082 UPON PRESENTING THE GOVERNOR WITH A VEST HE IMMEDIATELY CUT OFF THE BUTTONS AND DIVIDING THE CLOTH INTO FOUR PARTS SHARED IT WITH HIS FELLOWS
7030-64588-0083 BUT IN ALL OUR INTERCOURSE WITH THESE WILD MEN
7030-64588-0084 AND SIRUP AND AT COCA WE TOOK IN THREE FOWLS A BAG OF RICE AND A BUNCH OF BANANAS SO WE FARED SUMPTUOUSLY EVERY DAY WE LEFT COCA ON THANKSGIVING DAY NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH
7030-64588-0085 AND TO IMITATE OUR DISTANT FRIENDS WE SACRIFICED AN EXTRA MEAL FRICASSEED CHICKEN JERKED BEEF BOILED YUCAS BANANAS ORANGES LEMONADE AND GUAYUSA
7030-64588-0086 FAVORED BY A POWERFUL CURRENT AND THE RHYTHMIC PADDLING OF OUR SANTA ROSANS WE MADE THIS DAY SIXTY MILES BUT OUR AVERAGE DAILY RUN WAS FIFTY MILES THE WINDS DOUBTLESS THE TRADES WERE ALMOST UNCHANGEABLY FROM THE EAST
7030-64588-0087 BUT AN OCCASIONAL PUFF WOULD COME FROM THE NORTHWEST WHEN WE RELIEVED OUR PADDLERS BY HOISTING A BLANKET FOR A SAIL SIX O'CLOCK WAS OUR USUAL HOUR OF DEPARTURE AND TEN OR TWELVE HOURS OUR TRAVELING TIME ALWAYS TYING UP AT A PLAIA OR ISLAND
7030-64588-0088 OF WHICH THERE ARE HOSTS IN THE NAPO BUT NEVER TO THE MAIN LAND FOR FEAR OF UNFRIENDLY INDIANS AND THE STILL MORE UNWELCOME TIGER OUR CREW ENCAMPED AT A RESPECTFUL THOUGH HAILING DISTANCE ON THE SECOND DAY FROM COCA
7030-64588-0089 WE WERE CAUGHT IN A SQUALL AND TO SAVE OUR ROOF WE RAN ASHORE NEARLY EVERY AFTERNOON WE WERE TREATED TO A SHOWER ACCOMPANIED BY A STRONG WIND BUT SELDOM BY THUNDER AND LIGHTNING THOUGH AT COCA WE HAD A BRILLIANT THUNDER STORM AT NIGHT
7030-64588-0090 AND AT A REGULAR HOUR SO THAT WE LEARNED WHEN TO EXPECT THEM ABOUT NOON THE EASTERN HORIZON WOULD BECOME SUDDENLY BLACK AND WHEN THIS HAD SPREAD TO THE ZENITH WE HEARD THE RUSH OF A MIGHTY WIND SWEEPING THROUGH THE FOREST AND THE CRASH OF FALLING TREES
7030-64588-0091 AND THEN DOWN FELL THE DELUGE THE INDIANS HAVE A SAYING THAT
7030-64588-0092 THE PATH OF THE SUN IS THE PATH OF THE STORM
7030-64588-0093 THESE STORM CLOUDS MOVED RAPIDLY FOR IN HALF AN HOUR ALL WAS QUIET ON THE NAPO AT QUITO TWO HUNDRED MILES WEST THE USUAL AFTERNOON SHOWER OCCURS TWO HOURS LATER
7030-64588-0094 TO DAY WE ENJOYED OUR LAST GLIMPSE OF THE ANDES FAR AWAY ACROSS THE GREAT FOREST WE HAD TRAVERSED WE COULD SEE THE BEAUTIFUL CONE OF COTOPAXI AND THE FLAT TOP OF CAYAMBI STANDING OUT IN PROUD PRE EMINENCE
