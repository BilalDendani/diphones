8295-281339-0000 SOMETIMES THE GREEDY FELLOW SWALLOWS GREAT STONES AND CHUNKS OF WOOD
8295-281339-0001 AND WHEN HE IS SMACKING HIS GREAT JAWS OVER HIS FOOD HE MAKES SUCH A GREEDY TERRIBLE NOISE THAT THE OTHER ANIMALS STEAL AWAY NERVOUSLY AND HIDE UNTIL IT SHALL BE MASTER CROCODILE'S
8295-281339-0002 SLEEPY TIME HE IS TOO LAZY TO WADDLE IN SEARCH OF A DINNER FAR FROM THE RIVER WHERE HE LIVES BUT ANY ANIMAL OR EVEN A MAN SWIMMER
8295-281339-0003 FOR WHAT SEEMS TO BE A GREENISH BROWN KNOBBY LOG OF WOOD FLOATING ON THE WATER HAS LITTLE BRIGHT EYES WHICH ARE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR ANYTHING WHICH MOVES
8295-281339-0004 AND BELOW THE WATER TWO GREAT JAWS ARE READY TO OPEN AND SWALLOW IN THE PREY OF MISTER HUNGRY MOUTH BUT NO MATTER HOW HUNGRY THE CROCODILE MAY BE
8295-281339-0005 HE WILL NOT TOUCH THE HEN EVEN IF SHE SHOULD VENTURE INTO HIS VERY JAWS AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT THE BLACK MEN OF THE CONGO RIVER WILL TELL YOU
8295-281339-0006 AND SURELY AS THEY ARE THE NEAREST NEIGHBORS OF THE BIG REPTILE THEY OUGHT TO KNOW IF ANY ONE DOES NOW THIS IS THE STORY WHICH THEY TELL TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CROCODILE WILL NOT EAT THE HEN
8295-281339-0007 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A HEN A COMMON PLUMP CLUCKY MOTHER HEN WHO USED EVERY DAY TO GO DOWN TO THE RIVER AND PICK UP BITS OF FOOD ON THE MOIST BANKS
8295-281339-0008 WERE MANY SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT THIS CONGO RIVER WAS THE HOME OF THE CROCODILE THE BIGGEST FIERCEST
8295-281339-0009 HUNGRIEST CROCODILE IN ALL AFRICA BUT ONE DAY WHEN SHE WENT DOWN TO THE WATER AS USUAL SHE HOPPED OUT ONTO WHAT LOOKED LIKE A MOSSY LOG SAYING TO HERSELF
8295-281339-0010 AHA THIS IS A FINE OLD TIMBER HOUSE IT IS FULL OF JUICY BUGS I KNOW I SHALL HAVE A GREAT FEAST TAP TAP
8295-281339-0011 PICK PICK THE HEN BEGAN TO SCRATCH AND PECK UPON THE ROUGH BARK OF THE LOG
8295-281339-0012 SUDDENLY SHE BEGAN TO FEEL VERY SEASICK
8295-281339-0013 THE LOG WAS TEETERING UP ON END LIKE A BOAT IN A STORM AND BEFORE SHE KNEW WHAT WAS REALLY HAPPENING THE POOR HEN FOUND HERSELF FLOUNDERING IN THE WATER IN THE VERY JAWS OF THE TERRIBLE CROCODILE
8295-281339-0014 HA HA CRIED THE CROCODILE IN HIS HARSH VOICE YOU TOOK ME FOR A LOG JUST AS THE OTHER SILLY CREATURES DO BUT I AM NO LOG MISSUS HEN AS YOU SHALL SOON SEE
8295-281339-0015 THE HEN WAS FRIGHTENED ALMOST TO DEATH BUT SHE KEPT HER PRESENCE OF MIND AND GASPED FRANTICALLY AS SHE SAW THE GREAT JAWS OPENING TO SWALLOW HER O BROTHER DON'T
8295-281339-0016 NOW THE CROCODILE WAS SO SURPRISED AT HEARING THE HEN CALL HIM BROTHER THAT HE KEPT HIS JAWS WIDE OPEN AND FORGOT TO SWALLOW HIS DINNER HE KEPT THEM OPEN FOR SOME TIME
8295-281339-0017 GAPING FOOLISHLY WONDERING WHAT THE HEN COULD MEAN AND HOW HE COULD POSSIBLY BE HER BROTHER AND BY THE TIME HE HAD REMEMBERED HOW HUNGRY HE WAS THERE WAS NOTHING FOR HIM TO EAT
8295-281339-0018 FOR THE HEN HAD SKIPPED AWAY JUST AS FAST AS HER FEET WOULD TAKE HER POUF
8295-281339-0019 WHAT A FOOL I WAS TO BE CAUGHT BY SUCH A WORD
8295-281339-0020 NOW THOUGH THE HEN HAD HAD SO NARROW AN ESCAPE IT HAD NOT SUFFICIENTLY TAUGHT HER A LESSON A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS ONCE MORE SHE WENT DOWN TO THE RIVER
8295-281339-0021 FOR SHE COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION OF THE BUG DINNER WHICH SHE KNEW SHE SHOULD FIND THERE BUT SHE KEPT HER EYES OPEN SHARPLY FOR ANY GREENY LOG WHICH MIGHT BE FLOATING ON THE WATER
8295-281339-0022 SAYING TO HERSELF OLD HUNGRY MOUTH SHALL NOT CATCH ME NAPPING THIS TIME I KNOW HIS WICKED TRICKS BUT THIS TIME THE CROCODILE WAS NOT FLOATING ON THE WATER LIKE A GREENY LOG
8295-281339-0023 COCKING HER HEAD KNOWINGLY ON ONE SIDE AS SHE SPIED A REAL LOG FLOATING OUT BEYOND WHICH SHE TOOK TO BE HER ENEMY AND AS SHE SCRATCHED IN THE SOFT MUD CHUCKLING TO THINK HOW SLY SHE WAS
8295-281339-0024 WITH A RUSH AND A RUSTLE DOWN POUNCED THE CROCODILE UPON HER AND ONCE MORE BEFORE SHE KNEW IT SHE FOUND HERSELF IN THE HORRID GATEWAY OF HIS JAWS THREATENED BY THE DOUBLE ROWS OF LONG WHITE
8295-281339-0025 YOU SHALL NOT ESCAPE ME THIS TIME I AM A LOG AM I LOOK AT ME AGAIN MISSUS HEN AM I A LOG AND HE CAME AT HER TO SWALLOW HER AT ONCE
8295-281339-0026 BUT AGAIN THE HEN SQUAWKED
8295-281339-0027 AGAIN THE CROCODILE PAUSED THUNDERSTRUCK BY THIS EXTRAORDINARY WORD OH BOTHER THE HEN HE CRIED
8295-281339-0028 SHE LIVES IN A TOWN ON THE LAND AND I LIVE IN MY KINGDOM OF MUD AND WATER HOW COULD TWO CREATURES POSSIBLY BE MORE UNLIKE HOW
8295-281339-0029 BUT WHILE HE HAD BEEN THINKING OF THESE HOWS ONCE MORE THE HEN HAD MANAGED TO ESCAPE AND WAS PELTING BACK TO HER BARNYARD AS FAST AS SHE COULD GO
8295-281339-0030 THEN INDEED THE CROCODILE WAS ANGRY HE DETERMINED TO GO AND SEE NZAMBI THE WISE WITCH PRINCESS ABOUT THE MATTER
8295-281339-0031 BUT IT WAS A LONG JOURNEY TO HER PALACE AND HE WAS AWKWARD AND SLOW IN TRAVELING UPON LAND BEFORE HE HAD GONE VERY FAR HE WAS TIRED AND OUT OF BREATH AND STOPPED TO REST UNDER A BANANA TREE
8295-281339-0032 WHAT CAN IT BE DEAR FRIEND THAT IS TROUBLING YOU THIS DAY SHE SAID AMIABLY SURELY NO ONE WOULD BE SO RUDE OR RASH AS TO OFFEND THE KING OF CONGO RIVER BUT TELL ME YOUR TROUBLE AND PERHAPS I CAN ADVISE YOU
8295-281339-0033 SO DELIGHTFULLY FAT AND TEMPTING COMES TO MY RIVER TO FEED WELL WHY DON'T I MAKE HER MY DINNER YOU ASK NOW HEARKEN EACH TIME
8295-281339-0034 AND CARRY HER TO MY HOME SHE STARTLES ME BY CALLING ME BROTHER
8295-281339-0035 TWICE I HAVE LET HER ESCAPE BECAUSE OF THE WORD BUT I CAN STAND IT NO LONGER
8295-281339-0036 BY PALAVER THE SLANGY CROCODILE MEANT A LONG SERIOUS TALK
8295-281339-0037 DO NOTHING OF THE KIND
8295-281339-0038 NOW LISTEN TO ME DON'T YOU KNOW DEAR CROCODILE THAT THE DUCK LIVES ON THE WATER THOUGH SHE IS NEITHER A FISH NOR A REPTILE AND THE DUCK LAYS EGGS
8295-281339-0039 AS FOR YOU DEAR OLD HUNGRY MOUTH
8295-281339-0040 HERE SHE WHISPERED DISCREETLY LOOKING AROUND TO SEE THAT NO ONE WAS LISTENING AT THIS MOMENT IN A SNUG NEST DUG OUT OF THE SAND ON THE BANKS OF THE CONGO
8295-281339-0041 MISSUS CROCODILE HAS COVERED WITH LEAVES TO HIDE THEM FROM YOUR ENEMIES
8295-281339-0042 AND IN A FEW WEEKS OUT OF THESE WILL SCAMPER SIXTY LITTLE WIGGLY CROCODILES YOUR DEAR HOMELY SCALY HUNGRY MOUTHED CHILDREN YES
8295-281339-0043 AS THE HEN HAS SAID SH
8295-281339-0044 WHISPERED THE CROCODILE NERVOUSLY
8295-281339-0045 WHAT YOU SAY IS UNDOUBTEDLY TRUE HE ADDED PENSIVELY AFTER THINKING A FEW MOMENTS THEN I SUPPOSE I MUST GIVE UP MY TEMPTING DINNER OF HEN I CANNOT EAT MY SISTER CAN I
8295-281339-0046 OF COURSE YOU CANNOT SAID THE MBAMBI AS HE RUSTLED AWAY THROUGH THE JUNGLE WE CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING WE WANT IN THIS WORLD NO I SEE WE CANNOT SIGHED THE CROCODILE
8295-281339-0047 AS HE WADDLED BACK TOWARDS THE BANKS OF THE CONGO NOW IN THE SAME OLD SPOT HE FOUND THE HEN WHO HAD BEEN IMPROVING HIS ABSENCE BY GREEDILY STUFFING HERSELF ON BEETLE BUGS FLIES AND MOSQUITOES
8295-281339-0048 UNTIL SHE WAS SO FAT THAT SHE COULD NOT RUN AWAY AT THE CROCODILE'S APPROACH SHE COULD ONLY STAND AND SQUAWK FEEBLY FLUTTERING HER RIDICULOUS WINGS BUT THE CROCODILE ONLY SAID
