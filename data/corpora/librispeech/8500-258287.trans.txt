8500-258287-0032 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN QUEEN JULUAR RETURNED FROM HER MOTHER TO HER OWN REALM HER BREAST WAS STRAITENED AND SHE WAS IN ILL CASE
8500-258287-0033 AND KNOWING NOT WHITHER TO GO NOR HOW TO FLY TILL ONE DAY THERE CAME A CERTAIN FOWLER TO THE ISLAND TO CATCH SOMEWHAT WHEREWITHAL TO GET HIS LIVING
8500-258287-0034 WITH RED BILL AND LEGS CAPTIVATING THE SIGHT AND BEWILDERING THE THOUGHT AND LOOKING THEREAT SAID IN HIMSELF VERILY YONDER IS A BEAUTIFUL BIRD NEVER SAW I ITS LIKE IN FAIRNESS OR FORM
8500-258287-0035 FOR HOW MUCH THIS FOWL O FOWLER QUOTH THE FOWLER WHAT WILT THOU DO WITH HIM AN THOU BUY HIM
8500-258287-0036 AND PLACING HIM IN A FINE CAGE HUNG HIM UP AFTER SETTING MEAT AND DRINK BY HIM WHEN THE KING CAME DOWN FROM THE DIVAN HE SAID TO THE EUNUCH WHERE IS THE BIRD BRING IT TO ME THAT I MAY LOOK UPON IT FOR BY ALLAH TIS BEAUTIFUL
8500-258287-0037 SO THE EUNUCH BROUGHT THE CAGE AND SET IT BETWEEN THE HANDS OF THE KING WHO LOOKED AND SEEING THE FOOD UNTOUCHED SAID BY ALLAH I WIS NOT WHAT IT WILL EAT THAT I MAY NOURISH IT THEN HE CALLED FOR FOOD
8500-258287-0038 AND ALL THE BYSTANDERS MARVELLED AND THE KING SAID TO HIS ATTENDANTS EUNUCHS AND MAMELUKES IN ALL MY LIFE I NEVER SAW A BIRD EAT AS DOTH THIS BIRD THEN HE SENT AN EUNUCH TO FETCH HIS WIFE THAT SHE MIGHT ENJOY LOOKING UPON THE BIRD
8500-258287-0039 AND HE WENT IN TO SUMMON HER AND SAID O MY LADY THE KING DESIRETH THY PRESENCE THAT THOU MAYST DIVERT THYSELF WITH THE SIGHT OF A BIRD HE HATH BOUGHT WHEN WE SET ON THE FOOD
8500-258287-0040 IT FLEW DOWN FROM ITS CAGE AND PERCHING ON THE TABLE
8500-258287-0041 SO ARISE O MY LADY AND SOLACE THEE WITH THE SIGHT FOR IT IS GOODLY OF ASPECT AND IS A WONDER OF THE WONDERS OF THE AGE HEARING THESE WORDS SHE CAME IN HASTE BUT WHEN SHE NOTED THE BIRD
8500-258287-0042 ANSWERED SHE O KING
