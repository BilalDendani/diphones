4034-12475-0000 MAKE MENTION OF A FEW OF OUR LAWS WHICH BELONG TO PURIFICATIONS AND THE LIKE SACRED OFFICES
4034-12475-0001 THESE SACRIFICES WERE OF TWO SORTS OF THOSE SORTS ONE WAS OFFERED FOR PRIVATE PERSONS AND THE OTHER FOR THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL AND THEY ARE DONE IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS IN THE ONE CASE WHAT IS SLAIN IS BURNT
4034-12475-0002 AS A WHOLE BURNT OFFERING WHENCE THAT NAME IS GIVEN TO IT BUT THE OTHER IS A THANK OFFERING AND IS DESIGNED FOR FEASTING THOSE THAT SACRIFICE
4034-12475-0003 DO INDEED SACRIFICE THE SAME CREATURES BUT SUCH AS ARE UNBLEMISHED AND ABOVE A YEAR OLD HOWEVER THEY MAY TAKE EITHER MALES OR FEMALES THEY ALSO SPRINKLE THE ALTAR WITH THEIR BLOOD
4034-12475-0004 BUT THEY LAY UPON THE ALTAR THE KIDNEYS AND THE CAUL AND ALL THE FAT AND THE LOBE OF THE LIVER TOGETHER WITH THE RUMP OF THE LAMB THEN GIVING THE BREAST AND THE RIGHT SHOULDER TO THE PRIESTS THE OFFERERS FEAST UPON THE REMAINDER OF THE FLESH FOR TWO DAYS
4034-12475-0005 BUT WE SHALL TREAT MORE ACCURATELY ABOUT THE OBLATION OF THESE CREATURES IN OUR DISCOURSE CONCERNING SACRIFICES BUT IF A PERSON FALL INTO SIN BY IGNORANCE HE OFFERS AN EWE LAMB OR A FEMALE KID OF THE GOATS OF THE SAME AGE
4034-12475-0006 BUT IF ANY ONE SIN AND IS CONSCIOUS OF IT HIMSELF BUT HATH NOBODY THAT CAN PROVE IT UPON HIM HE OFFERS A RAM THE LAW ENJOINING HIM SO TO DO THE FLESH OF WHICH THE PRIESTS EAT AS BEFORE IN THE HOLY PLACE ON THE SAME DAY
4034-12475-0007 THAT THE FINEST FLOUR BE ALSO BROUGHT FOR A LAMB THE MEASURE OF ONE TENTH DEAL FOR A RAM TWO AND FOR A BULL THREE THIS THEY CONSECRATE UPON THE ALTAR WHEN IT IS MINGLED WITH OIL
4034-12475-0008 FOR OIL IS ALSO BROUGHT BY THOSE THAT SACRIFICE FOR A BULL THE HALF OF AN HIN AND FOR A RAM THE THIRD PART OF THE SAME MEASURE AND ONE QUARTER OF IT FOR A LAMB
4034-12475-0009 OR CONGIUSES THEY BRING THE SAME QUANTITY OF OIL WHICH THEY DO OF WINE AND THEY POUR THE WINE ABOUT THE ALTAR BUT IF ANY ONE DOES NOT OFFER A COMPLETE SACRIFICE OF ANIMALS BUT BRINGS FINE FLOUR ONLY FOR A VOW
4034-12475-0010 HE THROWS A HANDFUL UPON THE ALTAR AS ITS FIRST FRUITS WHILE THE PRIESTS TAKE THE REST FOR THEIR FOOD EITHER BOILED OR MINGLED WITH OIL BUT MADE INTO CAKES OF BREAD
4034-12475-0011 OF WHICH IT IS NOT LAWFUL TO LEAVE ANY PART TILL THE NEXT DAY ONLY THE PRIESTS ARE TO TAKE THEIR OWN SHARE CHAPTER TEN CONCERNING THE FESTIVALS
4034-12475-0012 A LAMB OF THE FIRST YEAR BE KILLED EVERY DAY AT THE BEGINNING AND AT THE ENDING OF THE DAY BUT ON THE SEVENTH DAY WHICH IS CALLED THE SABBATH THEY KILL TWO AND SACRIFICE THEM IN THE SAME MANNER
4034-12475-0013 WHICH THE MACEDONIANS CALL HYPERBERETAEUS THEY MAKE AN ADDITION TO THOSE ALREADY MENTIONED AND SACRIFICE A BULL A RAM AND SEVEN LAMBS
4034-12475-0014 THEY FAST TILL THE EVENING AND THIS DAY THEY SACRIFICE A BULL AND TWO RAMS AND SEVEN LAMBS AND A KID OF THE GOATS FOR SINS AND BESIDES THESE THEY BRING TWO KIDS OF THE GOATS
4034-12475-0015 BUT THE OTHER IS BROUGHT INTO A PLACE OF GREAT CLEANNESS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE CAMP AND IS THERE BURNT WITH ITS SKIN WITHOUT ANY SORT OF CLEANSING WITH THIS GOAT WAS BURNT A BULL NOT BROUGHT BY THE PEOPLE BUT BY THE HIGH PRIEST
4034-12475-0016 AND ABOUT THE GOLDEN ALTAR HE ALSO AT LAST BRINGS IT INTO THE OPEN COURT AND SPRINKLES IT ABOUT THE GREAT ALTAR BESIDES THIS THEY SET THE EXTREMITIES AND THE KIDNEYS AND THE FAT WITH THE LOBE OF THE LIVER UPON THE ALTAR
4034-12475-0017 AND FOURTEEN LAMBS AND FIFTEEN RAMS WITH THE ADDITION OF A KID OF THE GOATS AS AN EXPIATION FOR SINS AND ON THE FOLLOWING DAYS THE SAME NUMBER OF LAMBS AND OF RAMS WITH THE KIDS OF THE GOATS
4034-12475-0018 WITH A KID OF THE GOATS FOR AN EXPIATION OF SINS
4034-12475-0019 AND IS THE BEGINNING OF OUR YEAR ON THE FOURTEENTH DAY OF THE LUNAR MONTH WHEN THE SUN IS IN ARIES FOR IN THIS MONTH IT WAS THAT WE WERE DELIVERED FROM BONDAGE UNDER THE EGYPTIANS
4034-12475-0020 THE LAW ORDAINED THAT WE SHOULD EVERY YEAR SLAY THAT SACRIFICE WHICH I BEFORE TOLD YOU WE SLEW WHEN WE CAME OUT OF EGYPT AND WHICH WAS CALLED THE PASSOVER AND SO WE DO CELEBRATE THIS PASSOVER IN COMPANIES
4034-12475-0021 LEAVING NOTHING OF WHAT WE SACRIFICE TILL THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD SUCCEEDS THAT OF THE PASSOVER AND FALLS ON THE FIFTEENTH DAY OF THE MONTH AND CONTINUES SEVEN DAYS WHEREIN THEY FEED ON UNLEAVENED BREAD
4034-12475-0022 ON EVERY ONE OF WHICH DAYS TWO BULLS ARE KILLED AND ONE RAM AND SEVEN LAMBS NOW THESE LAMBS ARE ENTIRELY BURNT
4034-12475-0023 BESIDES THE KID OF THE GOATS WHICH IS ADDED TO ALL THE REST FOR SINS FOR IT IS INTENDED AS A FEAST FOR THE PRIEST ON EVERY ONE OF THOSE DAYS BUT ON THE SECOND DAY OF UNLEAVENED BREAD
4034-12475-0024 WHICH IS THE SIXTEENTH DAY OF THE MONTH THEY FIRST PARTAKE OF THE FRUITS OF THE EARTH FOR BEFORE THAT DAY THEY DO NOT TOUCH THEM AND WHILE THEY SUPPOSE IT PROPER TO HONOR GOD FROM WHOM THEY OBTAIN THIS PLENTIFUL PROVISION IN THE FIRST PLACE
4034-12475-0025 THEY OFFER THE FIRST FRUITS OF THEIR BARLEY AND THAT IN THE MANNER FOLLOWING THEY TAKE A HANDFUL OF THE EARS AND DRY THEM THEN BEAT THEM SMALL AND PURGE THE BARLEY FROM THE BRAN THEY THEN BRING ONE TENTH DEAL TO THE ALTAR TO GOD AND
4034-12475-0026 CASTING ONE HANDFUL OF IT UPON THE FIRE THEY LEAVE THE REST FOR THE USE OF THE PRIEST AND AFTER THIS IT IS THAT THEY MAY PUBLICLY OR PRIVATELY REAP THEIR HARVEST THEY ALSO AT THIS PARTICIPATION OF THE FIRST FRUITS OF THE EARTH SACRIFICE A LAMB
4034-12475-0027 WHICH WEEKS CONTAIN FORTY AND NINE DAYS ON THE FIFTIETH DAY WHICH IS PENTECOST BUT IS CALLED BY THE HEBREWS ASARTHA WHICH SIGNIFIES PENTECOST THEY BRING TO GOD A LOAF MADE OF WHEAT FLOUR
4034-12475-0028 THEY OFFER BURNT OFFERINGS THEY ALSO ALLOW THEMSELVES TO REST ON EVERY ONE OF THEM ACCORDINGLY THE LAW PRESCRIBES IN THEM ALL WHAT KINDS THEY ARE TO SACRIFICE AND HOW THEY ARE TO REST ENTIRELY
4034-12475-0029 SIX ON A HEAP ONE LOAF STILL STANDING OVER AGAINST ANOTHER WHERE TWO GOLDEN CUPS FULL OF FRANKINCENSE WERE ALSO SET UPON THEM AND THERE THEY REMAINED TILL ANOTHER SABBATH AND THEN OTHER LOAVES WERE BROUGHT IN THEIR STEAD
4034-12475-0030 WHILE THE LOAVES WERE GIVEN TO THE PRIESTS FOR THEIR FOOD AND THE FRANKINCENSE WAS BURNT IN THAT SACRED FIRE WHEREIN ALL THEIR OFFERINGS WERE BURNT ALSO AND SO OTHER FRANKINCENSE WAS SET UPON THE LOAVES INSTEAD OF WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE
4034-12475-0031 THE HIGH PRIEST ALSO OF HIS OWN CHARGES OFFERED A SACRIFICE AND THAT TWICE EVERY DAY IT WAS MADE OF FLOUR MINGLED WITH OIL AND GENTLY BAKED BY THE FIRE THE QUANTITY WAS ONE TENTH DEAL OF FLOUR HE BROUGHT THE HALF OF IT TO THE FIRE IN THE MORNING
4034-12475-0032 AND THE OTHER HALF AT NIGHT THE ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES I SHALL GIVE MORE ACCURATELY HEREAFTER BUT I THINK I HAVE PREMISED WHAT FOR THE PRESENT MAY BE SUFFICIENT CONCERNING THEM CHAPTER ELEVEN
4034-12475-0033 AND SET THEM APART TO BE A HOLY TRIBE AND PURIFIED THEM BY WATER TAKEN FROM PERPETUAL SPRINGS AND WITH SUCH SACRIFICES AS WERE USUALLY OFFERED TO GOD ON THE LIKE OCCASIONS
4034-12475-0034 HE DELIVERED TO THEM ALSO THE TABERNACLE AND THE SACRED VESSELS AND THE OTHER CURTAINS WHICH WERE MADE FOR COVERING THE TABERNACLE THAT THEY MIGHT MINISTER UNDER THE CONDUCT OF THE PRIESTS
4034-12475-0035 WHICH MATTERS WHEN THIS WORK SHALL GIVE ME OCCASION SHALL BE FURTHER EXPLAINED
4034-12475-0036 AND THAT HAD A GONORRHEA SHOULD NOT COME INTO THE CITY NAY HE REMOVED THE WOMEN WHEN THEY HAD THEIR NATURAL PURGATIONS TILL THE SEVENTH DAY AFTER WHICH HE LOOKED ON THEM AS PURE AND PERMITTED THEM TO COME IN AGAIN
4034-12475-0037 THE ONE OF WHICH THEY ARE TO PURGE BY FIRE AND FOR THE OTHER THE PRIESTS TAKE IT FOR THEMSELVES IN THE SAME MANNER DO THOSE SACRIFICE WHO HAVE HAD THE GONORRHEA BUT HE THAT SHEDS HIS SEED IN HIS SLEEP
4034-12475-0038 IF HE GO DOWN INTO COLD WATER HAS THE SAME PRIVILEGE WITH THOSE THAT HAVE LAWFULLY ACCOMPANIED WITH THEIR WIVES AND FOR THE LEPERS HE SUFFERED THEM NOT TO COME INTO THE CITY AT ALL NOR TO LIVE WITH ANY OTHERS AS IF THEY WERE IN EFFECT DEAD PERSONS
4034-12475-0039 BUT IF ANY ONE HAD OBTAINED BY PRAYER TO GOD THE RECOVERY FROM THAT DISTEMPER AND HAD GAINED A HEALTHFUL COMPLEXION AGAIN
4034-12475-0040 WHEN HE FLED OUT OF EGYPT AND THAT HE BECAME THE CONDUCTOR OF THOSE WHO ON THAT ACCOUNT LEFT THAT COUNTRY AND LED THEM INTO THE LAND OF CANAAN FOR HAD THIS BEEN TRUE MOSES WOULD NOT HAVE MADE THESE LAWS TO HIS OWN DISHONOR
4034-12475-0041 WHICH INDEED IT WAS MORE LIKELY HE WOULD HAVE OPPOSED IF OTHERS HAD ENDEAVORED TO INTRODUCE THEM AND THIS THE RATHER BECAUSE THERE ARE LEPERS IN MANY NATIONS WHO YET ARE IN HONOR
4034-12475-0042 HAD BEEN LIABLE TO SUCH A MISFORTUNE IN THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN HE MIGHT HAVE MADE LAWS ABOUT THEM FOR THEIR CREDIT AND ADVANTAGE AND HAVE LAID NO MANNER OF DIFFICULTY UPON THEM ACCORDINGLY
4034-12475-0043 IT IS A PLAIN CASE THAT IT IS OUT OF VIOLENT PREJUDICE ONLY THAT THEY REPORT THESE THINGS ABOUT US BUT MOSES WAS PURE FROM ANY SUCH DISTEMPER AND LIVED WITH COUNTRYMEN WHO WERE PURE OF IT ALSO
4034-12475-0044 MOSES FORBADE THEM TO COME INTO THE TEMPLE OR TOUCH THE SACRIFICES BEFORE FORTY DAYS WERE OVER SUPPOSING IT TO BE A BOY
