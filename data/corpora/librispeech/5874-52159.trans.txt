5874-52159-0000 CHAPTER THREE THE MUSCULAR TYPE THE WORKER PEOPLE IN WHOM THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM IS PROPORTIONATELY LARGER
5874-52159-0001 THIS SYSTEM CONSISTS OF THE MUSCLES OF THE ORGANISM
5874-52159-0002 THE MUSCLE SYSTEM OF THE HUMAN BODY IS SIMPLY A CO ORDINATED ORGANIZED ARRANGEMENT OF LAYERS OF LEAN MEAT OF WHICH EVERY INDIVIDUAL HAS A COMPLETE SET AN INDIVIDUAL'S MUSCLES MAY BE SMALL FLABBY DEFICIENT IN STRENGTH OR SO THIN AS TO BE ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE
5874-52159-0003 BUT THEY ARE ALWAYS THERE ELEMENTARY IN THE INFANT FULL GROWN IN THE ADULT AND REMNANTS IN THE AGED BUT THEY ARE SO SMOOTHLY FITTED TOGETHER SO CLOSELY KNITTED AND USUALLY SO WELL COVERED
5874-52159-0004 IN THE PURE MUSCULAR TYPE HIS MUSCLES ARE FIRM AND LARGE SUCH MUSCLES CAN NOT BE DISGUISED BUT SEEM TO STAND OUT ALL OVER HIM HELPLESS WITHOUT THEM WITHOUT THEM WE WOULD BE HELPLESS MASSES OF FAT AND BONE
5874-52159-0005 WE COULD NOT BLINK AN EYE NOR LIFT A FINGER YET WE ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO THEM THAT WE RARELY THINK OF THEM AND SELDOM GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR WHAT THEY DO WITHOUT THEIR WONDER WORK TO ADJUST THE EYES WE COULD NOT SEE WITHOUT THEIR POWER THE HEART WOULD CEASE TO BEAT
5874-52159-0006 WE CAN NOT SMILE SOB SPEAK NOR SING WITHOUT USING THEM WE WOULD HAVE NO PIANISTS
5874-52159-0007 DANCERS AVIATORS INVENTORS OR WORKERS OF ANY KIND WITHOUT THEM EVERYTHING WE PUT TOGETHER FROM HOOKS AND EYES TO SKYSCRAPERS IS PLANNED BY OUR BRAINS BUT DEPENDS FOR ITS MATERIALIZATION UPON THE MUSCLES OF THE HUMAN BODY
5874-52159-0008 HOW TO KNOW HIM LOOK AT ANY INDIVIDUAL
5874-52159-0009 OR THICKLY PADDED WITH FAT IN WHICH CASE
5874-52159-0010 OR WELL UPHOLSTERED WITH FIRM MEAT IN THE LATTER CASE HE IS LARGELY MUSCULAR NO MATTER WHAT OTHER TYPES MAY BE PRESENT IN HIS MAKEUP
5874-52159-0011 OR MOSTLY MUSCLE BECAUSE FAT IS ALWAYS ROUND AND SOFT WHILE MUSCLE IS FIRM AND DEFINITE PHYSICAL SOLIDITY A GENERAL SOLIDITY OF STRUCTURE
5874-52159-0012 AND THOUGH IT MAKES A DENT THAT DENT PUFFS BACK QUICKLY
5874-52159-0013 BUT STAYS THERE LONGER ONCE THE DENT IS MADE NOT SO MALLEABLE
5874-52159-0014 OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE TWO NATURES THROUGHOUT THEIR ENTIRETY
5874-52159-0015 IS LESS SUGGESTIBLE IS LESS TRACTABLE THAN THE ALIMENTIVE OR THORACIC BUT IS LESS LIKELY TO REVERT AFTERWARDS BUILT ON THE SQUARE ON THE SQUARE IS A FIGURATIVE EXPRESSION USUALLY APPLYING TO A MORAL TENDENCY IN THIS SENSE
5874-52159-0016 BUT IN A PURELY LITERAL SENSE THE MUSCULAR IS ACTUALLY BUILT ON THE SQUARE HIS WHOLE FIGURE IS A COMBINATION OF SQUARES THE ALIMENTIVE IS BUILT UPON THE CIRCLE THE THORACIC ON THE KITE SHAPE BUT THE PURE MUSCULAR ALWAYS TENDS TOWARD A SQUARENESS OF OUTLINE
5874-52159-0017 WE REPEAT HE IS NO MORE SQUARE MORALLY THAN ANY OTHER TYPE
5874-52159-0018 THAN TO OTHERS EACH TYPE HAS ITS OWN WEAKNESSES AND POINTS OF STRENGTH AS DIFFERENTIATED FROM OTHER TYPES AND THESE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE MORAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PEOPLE NO TYPE SUPERIOR MORALLY
5874-52159-0019 AND SINCE EACH TYPE POSSESSES ABOUT AS MANY WEAKNESSES AS THE OTHERS IT FOLLOWS THAT NO TYPE IS SUPERIOR MORALLY TO ANY OTHER AND NO TYPE IS MORALLY INFERIOR TO ANY OTHER TYPE AND TEMPTATION MORALITY IS MOSTLY A MATTER OF HOW MUCH TEMPTATION YOU CAN WITHSTAND
5874-52159-0020 IS SURROUNDED BY TEMPTATIONS OF SOME KIND MOST OF THE TIME HE DOES NOT WANT TO YIELD TO ANY OF THEM
5874-52159-0021 OF WHICH HIS PARTICULAR TYPE IS CAPABLE UNDER A GIVEN CIRCUMSTANCE
5874-52159-0022 HE YIELDS ONLY TO THOSE WHICH MAKE SUCH A STRONG APPEAL TO HIS TYPE THAT HE LACKS THE POWER OF RESISTANCE
5874-52159-0023 IN THE GRIP OF THESE TEMPTATIONS HE MAY COMMIT ANYTHING FROM DISCOURTESY TO CRIME ACCORDING TO THE STRENGTH OF THE TEMPTATION PLUS HIS OWN LEANING IN THAT DIRECTION ON THE OTHER HAND CERTAIN IMMORALITIES WHICH APPEAL STRONGLY TO SOME TYPES HAVE NO ATTRACTION WHATEVER FOR OTHERS
5874-52159-0024 AND THESE LATTER GET CREDIT FOR A VIRTUOUSNESS THAT HAS COST THEM NOTHING PRAISE AND PUNISHMENT ON THE OTHER HAND EACH ONE OF THE FIVE HUMAN TYPES HAS CERTAIN POINTS OF STRENGTH AND FROM THESE GETS ITS NATURAL MORAL QUALITIES
5874-52159-0025 WE WILL GIVE LESS OF BOTH TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND MORE OF BOTH TO THE CREATOR TYPE VS TRAINING THE MOST THAT TRAINING CAN DO IS TO BRACE UP THE WEAK SPOTS IN US TO CULTIVATE THE STRONG ONES
5874-52159-0026 INIMICAL ENVIRONMENTS AND TO CONSTANTLY REMIND US OF THE PENALTIES WE PAY WHENEVER WE DIGRESS CHILD TRAINING AS THIS GREAT SCIENCE OF HUMAN ANALYSIS BECOMES KNOWN THE WORLD WILL UNDERSTAND FOR THE FIRST TIME HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVES
5874-52159-0027 AND WHY IT LIVES THAT WAY WE WILL KNOW WHY ONE CHILD JUST NATURALLY TELLS FIBS WHILE HIS TWIN BROTHER UNDER IDENTICAL TRAINING JUST NATURALLY TELLS THE TRUTH
5874-52159-0028 TO EACH THE KIND OF TRAINING WHICH WILL WEED OUT HIS WORST AND BRING OUT HIS BEST SHORT AND STOCKY
5874-52159-0029 THOUGH ONE OF ANY HEIGHT MAY BE LARGELY MUSCULAR THE EXTREME TYPE OF WHICH WE ARE TREATING IN THIS CHAPTER
5874-52159-0030 BUT HIS HEAVINESS IS DUE TO MUSCLE INSTEAD OF FAT HE HAS THE APPEARANCE OF STANDING FIRMLY SOLIDLY UPON THE GROUND OF BEING STALWART AND STRONG THE SQUARE SHOULDERED MAN
5874-52159-0031 AND ARE MUCH BROADER IN PROPORTION TO HIS HEIGHT THE ALIMENTIVE HAS SLOPING SHOULDERS AND THE THORACIC INCLINES TO HIGH SHOULDERS
5874-52159-0032 YOU HAVE KNOWN WERE NOT TALL MEN BUT MEDIUM OR BELOW MEDIUM IN HEIGHT
5874-52159-0033 WHO IS A COMBINATION HAS PROPORTIONATELY LONG ARMS THE ARMS OF PURE MUSCULARS ARE LONGER IN PROPORTION TO THE BODY THAN THE ARMS OF OTHER TYPES THE ARMS OF THE ALIMENTIVE ARE SHORT FOR HIS BODY BUT THE EXTREME MUSCULAR'S ARMS
5874-52159-0034 ARE ALWAYS ANYWHERE FROM SLIGHTLY LONGER TO VERY MUCH LONGER THAN HIS HEIGHT WOULD LEAD YOU TO EXPECT THE PURE MUSCULAR HEAD A SQUARE HEAD IS THE FIRST THING YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU LOOK AT A PURE MUSCULAR HIS HEAD HAS NO SUCH DECIDED DIGRESSIONS FROM THE NORMAL AS THE ROUND HEAD
5874-52159-0035 A STURDY NECK IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT INDICATIONS OF PHYSICAL PROWESS AND LONGEVITY WHILE THE FRAIL NECK OF WHICH WE SHALL SPEAK IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIFTH TYPE IS ALWAYS A SIGN OF THE PHYSICAL FRAILTY WHICH ENDANGERS LIFE
5874-52159-0036 THE THICKNESS OF HIS NECK MAY SOMETIMES GIVE YOU THE IMPRESSION THAT THE MUSCULAR HEAD IS SMALL
5874-52159-0037 HIS SQUARE FACE
5874-52159-0038 AS TO GIVE HIM A RIGHT ANGLED FACE HIS SQUARE JAW A BROAD JAW IS ANOTHER CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS TYPE NOT ONLY IS IT SQUARE LOOKED AT FROM THE FRONT
5874-52159-0039 TEND TO MAKE A RIGHT ANGLED TURN AT THE CORNERS INSTEAD OF A ROUNDED CURVE
5874-52159-0040 A BOX LIKE APPEARANCE IT IS CONSIDERED BECOMING TO MEN
5874-52159-0041 THE TYPICAL MUSCULAR HAND
5874-52159-0042 THEIR SIZE SHAPE AND STRUCTURE AS SEEN FROM THE BACK OF THE HAND ARE ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT AND TELL US MUCH MORE ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL'S NATURE THAN THE PALM DOES PERHAPS YOU HAVE THOUGHT THAT A HAND WAS JUST A HAND BUT THERE ARE HANDS AND HANDS
5874-52159-0043 EACH PURE TYPE HAS ITS OWN AND NO OTHER IS EVER SEEN ON THE EXTREME OF THAT TYPE THE HAND OF THE MUSCULAR LIKE ALL THE REST OF HIS BODY IS BUILT IN A SERIES OF SQUARES IT RUNS OUT FROM THE WRIST AND DOWN IN A STRAIGHTER LINE
5874-52159-0044 SPATULATE FINGERS MEANING FINGERS THAT ARE SQUARE OR PADDLE SHAPED AT THE TIPS
5874-52159-0045 HE MAY HAVE OTHER TYPES IN COMBINATION BUT IF HIS FINGERS ARE REALLY SQUARE SAWED OFF AT THE ENDS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO GIVE THEM LARGE INSTEAD OF TAPERING ENDS THAT PERSON HAS MORE THAN AVERAGE MUSCULARITY
5874-52159-0046 AND THE ACTIVITIES OF HIS LIFE WILL TEND IN THE DIRECTIONS REFERRED TO IN THIS CHAPTER THE MANUAL WORKER MUSCULARS ARE THE HAND WORKERS OF THE WORLD
5874-52159-0047 THE MUSCULAR'S HAND IS PROPORTIONATELY LARGER THAN THE HAND OF ANY OTHER TYPE IT HAS MORE MUSCLE THAT ONE ELEMENT WITHOUT WHICH GOOD HAND WORK IS IMPOSSIBLE SO IT HAS FOLLOWED INEVITABLY THAT THE MANUAL WORK OF THE WORLD IS DONE LARGELY BY MUSCULARS THEIR HANDS ARE ALSO SO MUCH MORE POWERFUL
5874-52159-0048 THE HAND OF THE CREATIVE ARTIST THE ARTIST'S HAND AND THE ARTISTIC HAND ARE PHRASES LONG USED BUT MISUSED DELICATE TAPERING FINGERS WERE SUPPOSED IN ANCIENT TIMES TO DENOTE ARTISTIC ABILITY
5874-52159-0049 THE FRAIL CURVING HAND WAS ALSO SUPPOSED TO BE A SIGN OF ARTISTIC TALENT FROM THE STAGE OF OLD DOWN TO THE MOVIES OF TODAY THE TYPICAL ARTIST IS PICTURED WITH A SLIGHT SLENDER HAND THIS TAPERING FINGERED HAND DENOTES A KEEN SENSE OF ARTISTIC VALUES
5874-52159-0050 A LOVE OF THE ESTHETIC REFINED AND BEAUTIFUL AND REAL ARTISTIC APPRECIATION BUT NOT THE ABILITY TO CREATE THE HAND ARTS BEFORE WE EXPLAIN THIS
5874-52159-0051 OR MUSICAL COMPOSITION WHICH COULD MORE PROPERLY BE CALLED ARTISTIC ACTIVITIES
5874-52159-0052 UPON THE HUMAN HAND SUCH AS PAINTING ARCHITECTURE CRAFTSMANSHIP CARTOONING SCULPTURE VIOLIN PIANO ET CETERA ALL THESE ARE CREATED BY SQUARE FINGERED PEOPLE
5874-52159-0053 WE ARE TOO MUCH INCLINED TO THINK OF THE PRODUCTS OF THESE ARTS AS BEING CREATED OUT OF SHEER ARTISTIC SENSE ARTISTIC TASTE OR ARTISTIC INSIGHT BUT A MOMENT'S REFLECTION WILL SHOW THAT EVERY TANGIBLE ARTISTIC CREATION
5874-52159-0054 WITH GIFTED HEAD WORK WITHOUT A SURE STRONG WELL KNIT HAND
5874-52159-0055 THE LACK OF SUCH A HAND EXPLAINS WHY THE ESTHETIC THE ARTISTIC MINDED AND THE CONNOISSEUR DO NOT CREATE THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS THEY APPRECIATE HEAD AND HAND PARTNERS THE HAND MUST EXECUTE WHAT THE BRAIN PLANS
5874-52159-0056 IT MUST BE A FIFTY PER CENT PARTNER ELSE ITS OWNER WILL NEVER PRODUCE REAL ART
5874-52159-0057 CO ORDINATED HAND MACHINE TO ANY SUCH DEGREE AS THE MUSCULAR
5874-52159-0058 OR THE EXECUTION WILL FALL SHORT OF THE IDEAL PICTURED IN THE ARTIST'S MIND THE PURE MUSCULAR TYPE SELDOM MAKES AN ARTIST FOR AFTER ALL INSPIRED BRAIN WORK IS THE OTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THE CREATION OF ART AND THIS IS THE FORTE OF THE FIFTH TYPE
5874-52159-0059 A COMBINATION OF THE FIFTH TYPE WITH THE MUSCULAR MAKES MOST HAND ARTISTS
5874-52159-0060 MAKES MOST SINGERS EVERY HAND ARTIST WILL BE FOUND TO HAVE SPATULATE FINGERED HANDS IN SHORT MUSCULAR HANDS THE HAND OF THE FAMOUS CRAFTSMAN PIANIST SCULPTOR AND PAINTER INSTEAD OF BEING MORE FRAIL AND DELICATE
5874-52159-0061 IS ALWAYS LARGER AND HEAVIER THAN THAT OF THE AVERAGE PERSON SUCH A HAND
5874-52159-0062 IN THAT INDIVIDUAL'S MAKEUP HIS POWERFUL MOVEMENTS FORCEFUL DECISIVE MOVEMENTS ALSO CHARACTERIZE THIS TYPE HE IS INCLINED TO GO AT EVEN THE MOST TRIVIAL THINGS WITH AS MUCH FORCE AS IF THE WORLD DEPENDED ON IT
5874-52159-0063 RECENTLY WE WERE EXHIBITING A SMALL PENCIL SHARPENER TO A MUSCULAR FRIEND IT WAS SO SHARP THAT IT PERFORMED ITS WORK WITHOUT PRESSURE BUT SHE TOOK HOLD OF IT AS IF IT WERE A PIECE OF ARTILLERY AND PUSHED THE PENCIL INTO IT WITH ALL THE FORCE SHE HAD WHEN WE REMONSTRATED SMILINGLY
5874-52159-0064 FOR HER FACE AND HANDS ARE ULTRA SQUARE SHE SAID BUT I CAN'T DO ANYTHING LIGHTLY I JUST NATURALLY PUT THAT MUCH FORCE INTO EVERYTHING HIS FORCEFUL WALK HEAVY POWERFUL FORCEFUL STRIDES DISTINGUISH THE WALK OF THIS TYPE
5874-52159-0065 IF HE HAS BUT TEN STEPS TO GO HE WILL START OFF AS IF BEGINNING AN AROUND THE WORLD MARATHON YOU HEAR HIM COMING ALL MUSCULARS NOTIFY PEOPLE BY THEIR WALK OF THEIR APPROACH THEY ARE UNCONSCIOUS OF THIS LOUD INCISIVE TREAD
5874-52159-0066 BELONGS ALMOST ALWAYS TO A MUSCULAR
5874-52159-0067 TONE DOWN THIS POWERFUL VOICE HIS LONG SUFFERING FRIENDS WILL TESTIFY TO THIS CHARACTERISTIC HIS STENTORIAN TONES THIS LOUD VOICE IS A SERIOUS SOCIAL HANDICAP TO HIM HIS ONLY CHANCE OF COMPENSATION FOR IT LIES
5874-52159-0068 IN ITS USE BEFORE JURIES CONGREGATIONS OR LARGE AUDIENCES IT MIGHT BE NOTED HERE THAT EVERY GREAT ORATOR HAS BEEN LARGELY OF THIS TYPE AND ALSO THAT HIS FAME CAME NOT ALONE FROM THE THINGS HE SAID BUT FROM THE STENTORIAN TONES IN WHICH HE SAID THEM
5874-52159-0069 FAMOUS MALE SINGERS CARUSO JOHN MC CORMACK AND ALL OTHER FAMOUS MALE SINGERS
5874-52159-0070 BUT IN EVERY INSTANCE IT WAS COMBINED WITH A LARGE MUSCULAR DEVELOPMENT THE SOLID SITTER WHEN A MUSCULAR SITS DOWN HE DOES IT AS HE DOES EVERYTHING WITH DEFINITENESS AND FORCE HE DOES NOT SPILL OVER
5874-52159-0071 AS DOES THE ALIMENTIVE NOR DRAPE HIMSELF GRACEFULLY LIKE THE THORACIC BUT PLANKS HIMSELF AS THOUGH HE MEANT BUSINESS ACTIVITY HIS KEYNOTE BECAUSE HE IS ESPECIALLY BUILT FOR IT THE MUSCULAR IS MORE ACTIVE THAN ANY OTHER TYPE WITHOUT MUSCLES
5874-52159-0072 NO ORGANISM COULD MOVE ITSELF FROM THE SPOT IN WHICH IT WAS BORN BIOLOGY TEACHES US THAT THE STOMACH WAS THE FIRST THING EVOLVED THE ORIGINAL ONE CALL ORGANISM POSSESSED BUT ONE FUNCTION DIGESTION AS LIFE PROGRESSED IT BECAME NECESSARY TO SEND NUTRIMENT
5874-52159-0073 TO THOSE PARTS OF THE ORGANISM NOT TOUCHED BY THE STOMACH FOR THE PURPOSE OF REACHING THESE SUBURBS THERE WAS INVOLVED THE CIRCULATORY OR THORACIC SYSTEM AND THIS GAVE RISE AS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER TO THE THORACIC TYPE
5874-52159-0074 MOVEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT AS TIME WENT ON MOVEMENT BECAME NECESSARY FULL DEVELOPMENT NOT BEING POSSIBLE TO ANY STATIC ORGANISM
5874-52159-0075 IT WAS ONLY A WIGGLE AT FIRST BUT THAT WIGGLE HAS GROWN TILL TODAY IT INCLUDES EVERY KIND OF LABOR GLOBE TROTTING AND IMMIGRATION THE MUSCULAR IS FITTED WITH THE BEST TRAVELING EQUIPMENT OF ANY TYPE AND INVARIABLY LIVES A LIFE WHOSE MAIN REACTIONS EXPRESS THESE THINGS
5874-52159-0076 THE IMMIGRANT MUSCULAR NO MATTER WHAT HIS WORK OR PLAY THE MUSCULAR WILL MAKE MORE MOVES DURING THE COURSE OF A DAY THAN OTHER TYPES
5874-52159-0077 BEING OVER EQUIPPED FOR IT KEEP URGING HIM FROM WITHIN TO DO THINGS
5874-52159-0078 ITALIANS POLES GREEKS RUSSIANS GERMANS AND JEWS ARE LARGELY OF THIS TYPE
5874-52159-0079 INERTNESS IRKS HIM SHUT UP A MUSCULAR AND YOU DESTROY HIM HIS BIG MUSCLE SYSTEM CRIES OUT FOR SOMETHING TO DO HE BECOMES RESTLESS NERVOUS AND ILL WHEN CONFINED OR COMPELLED TO BE IDLE
5874-52159-0080 THE ALIMENTIVE LOVES AN EASY TIME BUT THE MUSCULAR DISLIKES EASE EXCEPT WHEN EXHAUSTED
5874-52159-0081 MUST BE DOING SOMETHING I CAN'T BEAR TO BE DOING NOTHING YOU OFTEN HEAR PEOPLE SAY SUCH A PERSON ALWAYS HAS PLENTY OF MUSCLE
5874-52159-0082 UP AND DOING ACCOMPLISHING SOMETHING IF THERE IS NOTHING NEAR THEM THAT NEEDS DOING THEY ARE SURE TO GO AND FIND SOMETHING THE BORN WORKER WORK IS SECOND NATURE TO THIS TYPE HE REALLY PREFERS IT EVERYONE LIKES SOME KIND OF WORK WHEN IN THE MOOD
5874-52159-0083 FOR THE ACTIVITY'S SAKE WORK PALLS ON THE ALIMENTIVE AND MONOTONY ON THE THORACIC BUT LEISURE IS WHAT PALLS ON THE MUSCULAR HE MAY HAVE WORKED TEN YEARS WITHOUT A VACATION AND HE MAY IMAGINE HE WANTS A LONG ONE
5874-52159-0084 IT MAY BE NOTHING MORE THAN HANGING THE SCREEN DOOR CHOPPING THE WOOD OR DUSTING THE FURNITURE BUT IT WILL FURNISH HIM WITH SOME KIND OF ACTIVITY BECAUSE HE ENJOYS ACTION FOR ITS OWN SAKE AND BECAUSE WORK IS ONLY APPLIED ACTION THIS TYPE MAKES THE BEST WORKER
5874-52159-0085 HE CAN BE TRUSTED TO WORK HARDER THAN ANY OTHER TYPE
5874-52159-0086 IT IS NO ACCIDENT THAT THE THREE HUNDRED MEN GANGS OF FOREIGN WORKMEN WHO DIG DITCHES TUNNELS AND TUBES CONSTRUCT BUILDINGS RAILROADS AND CITIES
