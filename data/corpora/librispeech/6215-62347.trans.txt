6215-62347-0000 MISSUS PRIME READS HER RECANTATION ABOVE AN HOUR HAD PASSED AFTER THE INTERRUPTION MENTIONED AT THE END OF THE LAST CHAPTER BEFORE MISSUS RAY AND RACHEL CROSSED BACK FROM THE FARM HOUSE TO THE COTTAGE AND WHEN THEY WENT THEY WENT ALONE
6215-62347-0001 DURING THAT HOUR THEY HAD BEEN SITTING IN MISSUS STURT'S PARLOUR AND WHEN AT LAST THEY GOT UP TO GO THEY DID NOT PRESS LUKE ROWAN TO GO WITH THEM MISSUS PRIME WAS AT THE COTTAGE
6215-62347-0002 AND IT WAS NECESSARY THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE EXPLAINED TO HER BEFORE SHE WAS ASKED TO GIVE HER HAND TO HER FUTURE BROTHER IN LAW THE FARMER HAD COME IN AND HAD JOKED HIS JOKE AND MISSUS STURT HAD CLACKED OVER THEM AS THOUGH THEY WERE A BROOD OF CHICKENS OF HER OWN HATCHING
6215-62347-0003 AND MISSUS RAY HAD SMILED AND CRIED AND SOBBED AND LAUGHED TILL SHE HAD BECOME ALMOST HYSTERICAL THEN SHE HAD JUMPED UP FROM HER SEAT SAYING OH DEAR WHAT WILL DOROTHEA THINK HAS BECOME OF US AFTER THAT RACHEL INSISTED UPON GOING
6215-62347-0004 AND THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER RETURNED ACROSS THE GREEN LEAVING LUKE AT THE FARM HOUSE READY TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE AS SOON AS MISSUS RAY AND RACHEL SHOULD HAVE SAFELY REACHED THEIR HOME I KNEW THEE WAS MINDED STEDFAST TO TAKE HER SAID MISSUS STURT
6215-62347-0005 IN ANSWER TO THIS LUKE PROTESTED THAT HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF RACHEL WHEN HE WAS MAKING THAT SPEECH AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN THAT ALL THAT WAS SOFT SAWDER AS HE CALLED IT FOR THE ELECTION BUT THE WORDS WERE TOO APPOSITE TO THE EVENT
6215-62347-0006 AND THE SENTIMENT TOO MUCH IN ACCORDANCE WITH MISSUS STURT'S CHIVALRIC VIEWS TO ALLOW OF HER ADMITTING THE TRUTH OF ANY SUCH ASSURANCE AS THIS I KNOW SHE SAID I KNOW AND WHEN I READ THEM WORDS IN THE NEWSPAPER I SAID TO THE GUDEMAN THERE
6215-62347-0007 WE SHALL HAVE BRIDECAKE FROM THE COTTAGE NOW BEFORE CHRISTMAS FOR THE MATTER OF THAT SO YOU SHALL SAID LUKE SHAKING HANDS WITH HER AS HE WENT OR THE FAULT WILL NOT BE MINE RACHEL AS SHE FOLLOWED HER MOTHER OUT FROM THE FARMYARD GATE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
6215-62347-0008 COULD IT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE SHE WOULD HAVE WISHED TO REMAIN SILENT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING AND FOR THE NIGHT SO THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE TIME TO THINK OF THIS THING WHICH SHE HAD DONE AND TO ENJOY THE FULL MEASURE OF HER HAPPINESS HITHERTO
6215-62347-0009 AND THE ACTION HAD BEEN SO QUICK THAT SHE HAD HARDLY FOUND A MOMENT FOR THOUGHT COULD IT BE THAT THINGS WERE SO FIXED THAT THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR FURTHER DISAPPOINTMENT SHE HAD BEEN SCALDED SO CRUELLY THAT SHE STILL FEARED THE HOT WATER
6215-62347-0010 HER HEART WAS SORE WITH THE OLD HURT AS THE HEAD THAT HAS ACHED WILL BE STILL SORE WHEN THE ACTUAL MALADY HAS PASSED AWAY SHE LONGED FOR HOURS OF ABSOLUTE QUIET IN WHICH SHE MIGHT MAKE HERSELF SURE THAT HER MALADY HAD ALSO PASSED AWAY
6215-62347-0011 AND THAT THE SORENESS WHICH REMAINED CAME ONLY FROM THE MEMORY OF FORMER PAIN BUT THERE WAS NO SUCH PERFECT REST WITHIN HER REACH AS YET WILL YOU TELL HER OR SHALL I SAID MISSUS RAY PAUSING FOR A MOMENT AT THE COTTAGE GATE
6215-62347-0012 YOU HAD BETTER TELL HER MAMMA I SUPPOSE SHE WON'T SET HERSELF AGAINST IT WILL SHE I HOPE NOT MAMMA I SHALL THINK HER VERY ILL NATURED IF SHE DOES BUT IT CAN'T MAKE ANY REAL DIFFERENCE NOW YOU
6215-62347-0013 KNOW NO IT CAN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE ONLY IT WILL BE SO UNCOMFORTABLE THEN WITH HALF FRIGHTENED MUFFLED STEPS THEY ENTERED THEIR OWN HOUSE AND JOINED MISSUS PRIME IN THE SITTING ROOM MISSUS PRIME WAS STILL READING THE SERIOUS BOOK
6215-62347-0014 BUT I AM BOUND TO SAY THAT HER MIND HAD NOT BEEN WHOLLY INTENT UPON IT DURING THE LONG ABSENCE OF HER MOTHER AND SISTER SHE HAD STRUGGLED FOR A TIME TO IGNORE THE SLIGHT FACT THAT HER COMPANIONS WERE AWAY GOSSIPING WITH THE NEIGHBOURING FARMER'S WIFE
6215-62347-0015 SHE HAD MADE A HARD FIGHT WITH HER BOOK PINNING HER EYES DOWN UPON THE PAGE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AS THOUGH IN PINNING DOWN HER EYES SHE COULD PIN DOWN HER MIND ALSO BUT BY DEGREES
6215-62347-0016 ACCORDING TO THE WORLD'S ORDINARY WICKEDNESS BUT SHE FEARED THAT IT WAS WICKED ACCORDING TO THAT TONE OF MORALS TO WHICH SHE WAS DESIROUS OF TYING HER MOTHER DOWN AS A BOND SLAVE THEY WERE AWAY TALKING ABOUT LOVE AND PLEASURE
6215-62347-0017 AND THOSE HEART THROBBINGS IN WHICH HER SISTER HAD SO UNFORTUNATELY BEEN ALLOWED TO INDULGE SHE FELT ALL BUT SURE THAT SOME TIDINGS OF LUKE ROWAN HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN MISSUS STURT'S BUDGET OF NEWS AND SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO THINK WELL OF LUKE ROWAN
6215-62347-0018 SINCE THE EVENING ON WHICH SHE HAD SEEN HIM STANDING WITH RACHEL IN THE CHURCHYARD SHE KNEW NOTHING AGAINST HIM BUT SHE HAD THEN MADE UP HER MIND THAT HE WAS PERNICIOUS AND SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO OWN THAT SHE HAD BEEN WRONG IN THAT OPINION
6215-62347-0019 SHE HAD BEEN LOUD AND DEFIANT IN HER DENUNCIATION WHEN SHE HAD FIRST SUSPECTED RACHEL OF HAVING A LOVER SINCE THAT SHE HAD UNDERGONE SOME TROUBLES OF HER OWN BY WHICH THE TONE OF HER REMONSTRANCES HAD BEEN NECESSARILY MODERATED
6215-62347-0020 BUT EVEN NOW SHE COULD NOT FORGIVE HER SISTER SUCH A LOVER AS LUKE ROWAN SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE WILLING TO SEE HER SISTER MARRIED BUT THE LOVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN DINGY BLACK COATED LUGUBRIOUS
6215-62347-0021 HAVING ABOUT HIM SOME TRUE ESSENCE OF THE TEARS OF THE VALLEY OF TRIBULATION ALAS HER SISTER'S TASTE WAS QUITE OF ANOTHER KIND
6215-62347-0022 SAID MISSUS RAY AS SHE ENTERED THE ROOM NO MOTHER I DIDN'T THINK THAT BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE STAYING LATE WITH MISSUS STURT SO WE WERE AND REALLY
6215-62347-0023 WHAT THE YOUNG MAN THAT WAS DISMISSED FROM MISTER TAPPITT'S IT WAS ILL SAID OF HER VERY ILL SAID AND SO SHE WAS HERSELF AWARE AS SOON AS THE WORDS WERE OUT OF HER MOUTH BUT SHE COULD NOT HELP IT
6215-62347-0024 SHE HAD TAKEN A SIDE AGAINST LUKE ROWAN AND COULD NOT RESTRAIN HERSELF FROM ILL NATURED WORDS RACHEL WAS STILL STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WHEN SHE HEARD HER LOVER THUS DESCRIBED BUT SHE WOULD NOT CONDESCEND TO PLEAD IN ANSWER TO SUCH A CHARGE
6215-62347-0025 THE COLOUR CAME TO HER CHEEKS AND SHE THREW UP HER HEAD WITH A GESTURE OF ANGRY PRIDE BUT AT THE MOMENT SHE SAID NOTHING MISSUS RAY SPOKE IT SEEMS TO ME DOROTHEA SHE SAID THAT YOU ARE MISTAKEN THERE
6215-62347-0026 I THINK HE HAS DISMISSED MISTER TAPPITT I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT SAID MISSUS PRIME I ONLY KNOW THAT THEY'VE QUARRELLED BUT IT WOULD BE WELL THAT YOU SHOULD LEARN
6215-62347-0027 BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU WILL BE GLAD TO THINK AS WELL OF YOUR BROTHER IN LAW AS POSSIBLE
6215-62347-0028 WHEN HE CAME OUT HERE AND DRANK TEA WITH US THAT EVENING CONTINUED MISSUS RAY I TOOK A LIKING TO HIM MOST UNACCOUNTABLE UNLESS IT WAS THAT I HAD A FORESHADOWING THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE SO NEAR AND DEAR TO ME MOTHER
6215-62347-0029 ONLY I DON'T THINK HE'LL EVER DO AWAY WITH CIDER IN DEVONSHIRE BECAUSE OF THE APPLE TREES BUT IF PEOPLE ARE TO DRINK BEER IT STANDS TO REASON THAT GOOD BEER WILL BE BETTER THAN BAD ALL THIS TIME RACHEL HAD NOT SPOKEN A WORD
6215-62347-0030 NOR HAD HER SISTER UTTERED ANYTHING EXPRESSIVE OF CONGRATULATION OR GOOD WISHES NOW AS MISSUS RAY CEASED THERE CAME A SILENCE IN THE ROOM AND IT WAS INCUMBENT ON THE ELDER SISTER TO BREAK IT
6215-62347-0031 IF THIS MATTER IS SETTLED RACHEL IT IS SETTLED I THINK SAID RACHEL IF IT IS SETTLED I HOPE THAT IT MAY BE FOR YOUR LASTING HAPPINESS AND ETERNAL WELFARE I HOPE IT WILL SAID RACHEL
6215-62347-0032 THAT'S QUITE TRUE MY DEAR SAID MISSUS RAY A MOST IMPORTANT STEP AND ONE THAT REQUIRES THE MOST EXACT CIRCUMSPECTION ESPECIALLY ON THE PART OF THE YOUNG WOMAN
6215-62347-0033 I HOPE YOU MAY HAVE KNOWN MISTER ROWAN LONG ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY YOUR CONFIDENCE IN HIM IT WAS STILL THE VOICE OF A RAVEN MISSUS PRIME AS SHE SPOKE THUS KNEW THAT SHE WAS CROAKING
6215-62347-0034 AND WOULD HAVE DIVESTED HERSELF OF HER CROAK AND SPOKEN JOYOUSLY HAD SUCH MODE OF SPEECH BEEN POSSIBLE TO HER BUT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE THOUGH SHE WOULD PERMIT NO SUCH FORESHADOWINGS AS THOSE AT WHICH HER MOTHER HAD HINTED
6215-62347-0035 SHE SAID WHEN THEY PARTED FOR THE NIGHT YOU HAVE MY BEST WISHES FOR YOUR HAPPINESS I HOPE YOU DO NOT DOUBT MY LOVE BECAUSE I THINK MORE OF YOUR WELFARE IN ANOTHER WORLD THAN IN THIS THEN SHE KISSED HER SISTER AND THEY PARTED FOR THE NIGHT
6215-62347-0036 RACHEL NOW SHARED HER MOTHER'S ROOM
6215-62347-0037 YOU MUSTN'T MIND DOROTHEA THE WIDOW SAID NO MAMMA I DO NOT I MEAN THAT YOU MUSTN'T MIND HER SEEMING TO BE SO HARD SHE MEANS WELL THROUGH IT ALL AND IS AS AFFECTIONATE AS ANY OTHER WOMAN WHY DID SHE SAY THAT HE HAD BEEN DISMISSED
6215-62347-0038 AH MY DEAR CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHEN SHE FIRST HEARD OF MISTER ROWAN CALL HIM LUKE MAMMA WHEN SHE FIRST HEARD OF HIM SHE WAS TAUGHT TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS GIDDY AND THAT HE DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING WHY SHOULD SHE THINK EVIL OF PEOPLE WHO TAUGHT HER
6215-62347-0039 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE THANKFUL ENOUGH WHEN I THINK HOW THINGS HAVE TURNED OUT BUT WHEN I FIRST HEARD OF HIM I THOUGHT HE WAS DANGEROUS TOO BUT YOU DON'T THINK HE IS DANGEROUS NOW MAMMA NO MY DEAR OF COURSE I DON'T AND I NEVER DID
6215-62347-0040 AFTER HE DRANK TEA HERE THAT NIGHT ONLY MISTER COMFORT TOLD ME IT WOULDN'T BE SAFE NOT TO SEE HOW THINGS WENT A LITTLE BEFORE YOU YOU UNDERSTAND DEAREST YES I UNDERSTAND
6215-62347-0041 SHE HAS BEHAVED BEST THROUGH IT ALL
6215-62347-0042 THAT NIGHT AND I ALMOST DOUBT WHETHER RACHEL SLEPT AT ALL IT SEEMED TO HER THAT IN THE PRESENT CONDITION OF HER LIFE SLEEP COULD HARDLY BE NECESSARY
6215-62347-0043 BUT WHY NEED SHE SLEEP NOW THAT EVERY THOUGHT WAS A NEW PLEASURE THERE WAS NO MOMENT THAT SHE HAD EVER PASSED WITH HIM THAT HAD NOT TO BE RECALLED THERE WAS NO WORD OF HIS THAT HAD NOT TO BE RE WEIGHED
6215-62347-0044 SHE REMEMBERED OR FANCIED THAT SHE REMEMBERED HER IDEA OF THE MAN WHEN HER EYE FIRST FELL UPON HIS OUTSIDE FORM SHE WOULD HAVE SWORN THAT HER FIRST GLANCE OF HIM HAD CONVEYED TO HER
6215-62347-0045 FAR MORE THAN HAD EVER COME TO HER FROM MANY A DAY'S CASUAL LOOKING AT ANY OTHER MAN SHE COULD ALMOST BELIEVE THAT HE HAD BEEN SPECIALLY MADE AND DESTINED FOR HER BEHOOF SHE BLUSHED EVEN WHILE LYING IN BED AS SHE REMEMBERED HOW THE GAIT OF THE MAN AND THE
6215-62347-0046 TONE OF HIS VOICE HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER EYES AND EARS FROM THE FIRST DAY ON WHICH SHE HAD MET HIM WHEN SHE HAD GONE TO MISSUS TAPPITT'S PARTY SO CONSCIOUSLY ALIVE TO THE FACT THAT HE WAS TO BE THERE
6215-62347-0047 BUT SHE NOW DECLARED TO HERSELF THAT SHE HAD BEEN A WEAK FOOL IN THUS ATTEMPTING TO DECEIVE HERSELF THAT SHE HAD LOVED HIM FROM THE FIRST OR AT ANY RATE FROM THAT EVENING WHEN HE HAD TOLD HER OF THE BEAUTY OF THE CLOUDS
6215-62347-0048 BUT THAT CHANCE WHICH HAD NOW BEEN SO WONDROUSLY DECIDED IN HER FAVOUR WHEN SHE CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST ON THE NEXT MORNING SHE WAS VERY QUIET SO QUIET THAT HER SISTER ALMOST THOUGHT SHE WAS FRIGHTENED AT HER FUTURE PROSPECTS
6215-62347-0049 BUT I THINK THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH FEAR SHE WAS SO HAPPY THAT SHE COULD AFFORD TO BE TRANQUIL IN HER HAPPINESS
6215-62347-0050 MISSUS RAY I FEAR DID NOT FIND THE LITTLE TEA PARTY SO AGREEABLE ON THAT EVENING AS SHE HAD DONE ON THE PREVIOUS OCCASION MISSUS PRIME DID MAKE SOME EFFORT AT CONVERSATION SHE DID ENDEAVOUR TO RECEIVE THE YOUNG MAN AS HER FUTURE BROTHER IN LAW SHE WAS GRACIOUS TO HIM WITH
6215-62347-0051 BUT THE DURATION OF THEIR MEAL WAS TERRIBLY LONG
6215-62347-0052 WHEN SHE HAD SO OBSTINATELY REFUSED THAT INVITATION AND HAD INSTEAD GONE OUT TO MEET THE TAPPITT GIRLS AND HAD MET WITH THEM THE YOUNG MAN OF WHOM HER SISTER HAD
6215-62347-0053 NOW HE WAS THERE ON PURPOSE TO TAKE HER WITH HIM AND SHE WENT FORTH WITH HIM LEANING LOVINGLY ON HIS ARM WHILE YET CLOSE UNDER HER SISTER'S EYES
6215-62347-0054 I THINK THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A GLEAM OF TRIUMPH IN HER FACE AS SHE PUT HER HAND WITH SUCH CONFIDENCE WELL ROUND HER LOVER'S ARM GIRLS DO TRIUMPH IN THEIR LOVERS IN THEIR ACKNOWLEDGED AND PERMITTED LOVERS AS YOUNG MEN TRIUMPH IN THEIR LOVES WHICH ARE NOT ACKNOWLEDGED OR PERHAPS PERMITTED
6215-62347-0055 DONE UP VERY PRETTILY WITH BLUE AND WHITE RIBBONS ROUND HIS HORNS BUT STILL AN OX PREPARED FOR SACRIFICE BUT THE GIRL FEELS HERSELF TO BE EXALTED FOR THOSE FEW WEEKS AS A CONQUEROR AND TO BE CARRIED ALONG IN AN OVATION OF WHICH THAT BUCOLIC VICTIM
6215-62347-0056 TIED ROUND WITH BLUE RIBBONS ON TO HIS HORNS IS THE CHIEF GRACE AND ORNAMENT IN THIS MOOD NO DOUBT BOTH RACHEL AND LUKE ROWAN WENT FORTH LEAVING THE TWO WIDOWS TOGETHER IN THE COTTAGE
6215-62347-0057 IT IS PRETTY TO SEE HER SO HAPPY ISN'T IT NOW SAID MISSUS RAY THE QUESTION FOR THE MOMENT MADE MISSUS PRIME UNCOMFORTABLE AND ALMOST WRETCHED BUT IT GAVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH IN HER HEART SHE DESIRED
6215-62347-0058 OF RECANTING HER ERROR IN REGARD TO LUKE ROWAN'S CHARACTER SHE WISHED TO GIVE IN HER ADHESION TO THE MARRIAGE TO BE KNOWN TO HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED ITS FITNESS SO THAT SHE COULD WITH SOME TRUE WORD OF SISTERLY LOVE WISH HER SISTER WELL
6215-62347-0059 IN RACHEL'S PRESENCE SHE COULD NOT HAVE FIRST MADE THIS RECANTATION THOUGH RACHEL SPOKE NO TRIUMPH THERE WAS A TRIUMPH IN HER EYE WHICH PREVENTED ALMOST THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH YIELDING ON THE PART OF DOROTHEA
6215-62347-0060 WHEN SHE SHOULD ONCE HAVE OWNED THAT RACHEL WAS NOT WRONG THEN GRADUALLY SHE COULD BRING HERSELF ROUND TO THE UTTERANCE OF SOME KINDLY EXPRESSION PRETTY SHE SAID YES IT IS PRETTY I DO NOT KNOW THAT
6215-62347-0061 SHE HAS HAD A SAD TIME OF IT DOROTHEA SINCE WE MADE HER WRITE THAT LETTER TO HIM A VERY SAD TIME OF IT
6215-62347-0062 ARE WE NOT TAUGHT THAT IT IS BETTER FOR US THAT IT SHOULD BE SO HAVE NOT YOU AND I MOTHER HAD A SAD TIME OF IT IT WOULD BE ALL SAD ENOUGH IF THIS WERE TO BE THE END OF IT
6215-62347-0063 YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT IT BETTER FOR HER OR FOR HIM EITHER THAT THEY SHOULD BE KEPT APART SEEING THAT THEY REALLY LOVE EACH OTHER NO I DON'T SAY THAT IF THEY LOVE ONE ANOTHER OF COURSE IT IS RIGHT THAT THEY SHOULD MARRY I ONLY WISH WE HAD KNOWN HIM LONGER
6215-62347-0064 IT SEEMS TO BE CERTAIN THAT HE IS AN INDUSTRIOUS STEADY YOUNG MAN EVERYBODY SEEMS TO SPEAK WELL OF HIM NOW WELL MOTHER I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY AGAINST HIM NOT A WORD AND IF IT WILL GIVE RACHEL ANY PLEASURE
6215-62347-0065 THOUGH I DON'T SUPPOSE IT WILL THE LEAST IN THE WORLD BUT IF IT WOULD SHE MAY KNOW THAT I THINK SHE HAS DONE
6215-62347-0066 AND I HOPE THEY WILL BE HAPPY TOGETHER FOR VERY MANY YEARS I LOVE RACHEL DEARLY THOUGH I FEAR SHE DOES NOT THINK SO AND ANYTHING I HAVE SAID I HAVE SAID IN LOVE NOT IN ANGER I'M SURE OF THAT DOROTHEA
6215-62347-0067 NOW THAT SHE IS TO BE SETTLED IN LIFE AS A MARRIED WOMAN
6215-62347-0068 AMEN SAID MISSUS RAY SOLEMNLY IT WAS THUS THAT MISSUS PRIME READ HER RECANTATION WHICH WAS REPEATED ON THAT EVENING TO RACHEL WITH SOME LITTLE SOFTENING TOUCHES YOU WON'T BE LIVING TOGETHER IN THE SAME HOUSE AFTER A BIT
6215-62347-0069 SHE HAS ONLY TO PUT OUT HER HAND THE LEAST LITTLE BIT IN THE WORLD AND I WILL GO THE REST OF THE WAY AS FOR HER LIVING I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL BE BEST ABOUT THAT BECAUSE LUKE SAYS THAT OF COURSE YOU'LL COME AND LIVE WITH US
6215-62347-0070 IT WAS TWO OR THREE DAYS AFTER THIS THAT RACHEL SAW THE TAPPITT GIRLS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE FACT OF HER ENGAGEMENT HAD BECOME KNOWN IT WAS IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD BEEN AGAIN WALKING WITH LUKE WHEN SHE MET THEM BUT AT THAT MOMENT SHE WAS ALONE
6215-62347-0071 AUGUSTA WOULD HAVE TURNED BOLDLY AWAY
6215-62347-0072 BUT TO THIS BOTH MARTHA AND CHERRY OBJECTED WE HAVE HEARD OF YOUR ENGAGEMENT SAID MARTHA AND WE CONGRATULATE YOU
6215-62347-0073 YES SAID AUGUSTA THE PLACE ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE AND SO WE THINK IT BEST TO GO
