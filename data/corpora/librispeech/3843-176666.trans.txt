3843-176666-0000 THE IMPROVEMENT COMPANY HAD BEEN FORMED TO ENCOURAGE THE GROWTH OF THE TOWN A SAFE WAS PUT IN THE BACK PART OF A FURNITURE STORE BEHIND A WOODEN PARTITION AND A BANK WAS STARTED UP THROUGH THE GAP AND TOWARD KENTUCKY
3843-176666-0001 MORE ENTRIES WERE DRIVEN INTO THE COAL AND ON THE VIRGINIA SIDE WERE SIGNS OF STRIPPING FOR IRON ORE A FURNACE WAS COMING IN JUST AS SOON AS THE RAILROAD COULD BRING IT IN AND THE RAILROAD WAS PUSHING AHEAD WITH GENUINE VIGOR
3843-176666-0002 MORE YOUNG MEN DRIFTED IN FROM ALL POINTS OF THE COMPASS A TENT HOTEL WAS PUT AT THE FOOT OF IMBODEN HILL AND OF NIGHTS THERE WERE UNDER IT MUCH POKER AND SONG THE LILT OF A DEFINITE OPTIMISM WAS IN EVERY MAN'S STEP
3843-176666-0003 AND THE LIGHT OF HOPE WAS IN EVERY MAN'S EYE AND THE GUARD WENT TO ITS WORK IN EARNEST EVERY MAN NOW HAD HIS WINCHESTER HIS REVOLVER HIS BILLY AND HIS WHISTLE DRILLING AND TARGET SHOOTING BECAME A DAILY PRACTICE
3843-176666-0004 BOB WHO HAD BEEN A YEAR IN A MILITARY SCHOOL WAS DRILL MASTER FOR THE RECRUITS AND VERY GRAVELY HE PERFORMED HIS DUTIES AND PUT THEM THROUGH THE SKIRMISHERS DRILL ADVANCING IN RUSHES THROWING THEMSELVES IN THE NEW GRASS
3843-176666-0005 AND VERY GRAVELY HE COMMENDED ONE ENTHUSIAST NONE OTHER THAN THE HON SAMUEL BUDD WHO RATHER THAN LOSE HIS POSITION IN LINE THREW HIMSELF INTO A POOL OF WATER ALL TO THE SURPRISE SCORN AND ANGER
3843-176666-0006 OF THE MOUNTAIN ONLOOKERS WHO DWELLED ABOUT THE TOWN MANY WERE THE COMMENTS THE MEMBERS OF THE GUARD HEARD FROM THEM

3843-176666-0009 EACH VOLUNTEER POLICEMAN WITH HIS BACK TO THE TARGET AND AT THE WORD OF COMMAND WHEELING AND FIRING SIX SHOTS IN RAPID SUCCESSION AND HE DID NOT WONDER AT THEIR SNORTS OF SCORN AT SUCH BAD SHOOTING
3843-176666-0010 AND THEIR OPEN ANGER THAT THE GUARD WAS PRACTISING FOR THEM BUT SOMETIMES HE GOT AN UNEXPECTED RECRUIT ONE BULLY WHO HAD BEEN CONSPICUOUS IN THE BRICKYARD TROUBLE AFTER WATCHING A DRILL WENT UP TO HIM WITH A GRIN HELL HE SAID CHEERILY
3843-176666-0011 AN DANGED IF I DON'T JINE YOU IF YOU'LL LET ME SURE SAID HALE
3843-176666-0012 BECAME MEMBERS AND THUS GETTING A VENT FOR THEIR ENERGIES WERE AS ENTHUSIASTIC FOR THE LAW AS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AGAINST IT OF COURSE THE ANTAGONISTIC ELEMENT IN THE TOWN LOST NO OPPORTUNITY TO PLAGUE AND HARASS THE GUARD
3843-176666-0013 AND AFTER THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BLIND TIGERS MISCHIEF WAS NATURALLY CONCENTRATED IN THE HIGH LICENSE SALOONS PARTICULARLY IN THE ONE RUN BY JACK WOODS WHOSE LOCAL POWER FOR EVIL AND CACKLING LAUGH
3843-176666-0014 SEEMED TO MEAN NOTHING ELSE THAN CLOSE PERSONAL COMMUNION WITH OLD NICK HIMSELF PASSING THE DOOR OF HIS SALOON ONE DAY BOB SAW ONE OF JACK'S CUSTOMERS TRYING TO PLAY POOL WITH A WINCHESTER IN ONE HAND
3843-176666-0015 AND THE BOY STEPPED IN AND HALTED
3843-176666-0016 AND BOB DID NOT KNOW WHETHER OR NOT HE HAD THE LEGAL RIGHT TO ARREST HIM SO HE TURNED
3843-176666-0017 PINIONED THE FELLOW'S ARMS FROM BEHIND AND BOB TOOK HIS WEAPON AWAY HELL SAID THE MOUNTAINEER I DIDN'T AIM TO HURT THE LITTLE FELLER I JES WANTED TO SEE IF I COULD SKEER HIM WELL BROTHER TIS SCARCE A MERRY JEST
3843-176666-0018 QUOTH THE HON SAM AND HE LOOKED SHARPLY AT JACK THROUGH HIS BIG SPECTACLES AS THE TWO LED THE MAN OFF TO THE CALABOOSE FOR HE SUSPECTED THAT THE SALOON KEEPER WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TRICK JACK'S TIME CAME ONLY THE NEXT DAY
3843-176666-0019 HE HAD REGARDED IT AS THE LIMIT OF INDIGNITY WHEN AN ORDINANCE WAS UP THAT NOBODY SHOULD BLOW A WHISTLE EXCEPT A MEMBER OF THE GUARD AND IT WAS GREAT FUN FOR HIM TO HAVE SOME DRUNKEN CUSTOMER BLOW A WHISTLE
3843-176666-0020 AND THEN STAND IN HIS DOOR AND LAUGH AT THE POLICEMEN RUNNING IN FROM ALL DIRECTIONS THAT DAY JACK TRIED THE WHISTLE HIMSELF AND HALE RAN DOWN WHO DID THAT HE ASKED JACK FELT BOLD THAT MORNING I BLOWED IT
3843-176666-0021 HALE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THE ORDINANCE AGAINST BLOWING A WHISTLE HAD NOT YET BEEN PASSED BUT HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES JACK'S BLOWING WAS A BREACH OF THE PEACE SINCE THE GUARD HAD ADOPTED THAT SIGNAL SO HE SAID
3843-176666-0022 YOU MUSTN'T DO THAT AGAIN JACK HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN GOING THROUGH PRECISELY THE SAME MENTAL PROCESS AND ON THE NICE LEGAL POINT INVOLVED HE SEEMED TO DIFFER I'LL BLOW IT WHEN I DAMN PLEASE HE SAID BLOW IT AGAIN AND I'LL ARREST YOU
3843-176666-0023 SAID HALE JACK BLEW HE HAD HIS RIGHT SHOULDER AGAINST THE CORNER OF HIS DOOR AT THE TIME AND WHEN HE RAISED THE WHISTLE TO HIS LIPS HALE DREW AND COVERED HIM BEFORE HE COULD MAKE ANOTHER MOVE WOODS BACKED SLOWLY INTO HIS SALOON
3843-176666-0024 TO GET BEHIND HIS COUNTER HALE SAW HIS PURPOSE AND HE CLOSED IN TAKING GREAT RISK AS HE ALWAYS DID TO AVOID BLOODSHED
3843-176666-0025 JACK MANAGED TO GET HIS PISTOL OUT
3843-176666-0026 AND HELD THE WEAPON AWAY SO THAT IT WAS HARMLESS AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED BUT A CROWD WAS GATHERING AT THE DOOR TOWARD WHICH THE SALOON KEEPER'S PISTOL WAS POINTED AND HE FEARED THAT SOMEBODY OUT THERE MIGHT BE SHOT SO HE CALLED OUT DROP THAT PISTOL
3843-176666-0027 THE ORDER WAS NOT OBEYED AND HALE RAISED HIS RIGHT HAND HIGH ABOVE JACK'S HEAD AND DROPPED THE BUTT OF HIS WEAPON ON JACK'S SKULL HARD JACK'S HEAD DROPPED BACK BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS HIS EYES CLOSED AND HIS PISTOL CLICKED ON THE FLOOR
3843-176666-0028 HALE KNEW HOW SERIOUS A THING A BLOW WAS IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD AND WHAT EXCITEMENT IT WOULD CREATE AND HE WAS UNEASY AT JACK'S TRIAL FOR FEAR THAT THE SALOON KEEPER'S FRIENDS WOULD TAKE THE MATTER UP BUT THEY DIDN'T
3843-176666-0029 AND TO THE SURPRISE OF EVERYBODY JACK QUIETLY PAID HIS FINE AND THEREAFTER THE GUARD HAD LITTLE ACTIVE TROUBLE FROM THE TOWN ITSELF FOR IT WAS QUITE PLAIN THERE AT LEAST THAT THE GUARD MEANT BUSINESS
3843-176666-0030 ACROSS BLACK MOUNTAIN OLD DAVE TOLLIVER AND OLD BUCK FALIN HAD GOT WELL OF THEIR WOUNDS BY THIS TIME AND THOUGH EACH SWORE TO HAVE VENGEANCE AGAINST THE OTHER AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE TO HANDLE A WINCHESTER
3843-176666-0031 BOTH FACTIONS SEEMED WAITING FOR THAT TIME TO COME MOREOVER THE FALINS BECAUSE OF A RUMOUR THAT BAD RUFE TOLLIVER MIGHT COME BACK AND BECAUSE OF DEVIL JUDD'S ANGER AT THEIR ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE YOUNG DAVE
3843-176666-0032 GREW WARY AND RATHER PACIFICATORY AND SO BEYOND A LITTLE QUARRELLING A LITTLE THREATENING AND THE EXCHANGE OF A HARMLESS SHOT OR TWO SOMETIMES IN BANTER SOMETIMES IN EARNEST NOTHING HAD BEEN DONE
3843-176666-0033 STERNLY HOWEVER THOUGH THE FALINS DID NOT KNOW THE FACT DEVIL JUDD CONTINUED TO HOLD ALOOF IN SPITE OF THE PLEADINGS OF YOUNG DAVE AND SO CONFIDENT WAS THE OLD MAN IN THE BALANCE OF POWER THAT LAY WITH HIM THAT HE SENT JUNE WORD
3843-176666-0034 THAT HE WAS COMING TO TAKE HER HOME AND IN TRUTH WITH HALE GOING AWAY AGAIN ON A BUSINESS TRIP AND BOB TOO GONE BACK HOME TO THE BLUEGRASS AND SCHOOL CLOSED THE LITTLE GIRL WAS GLAD TO GO
3843-176666-0035 MISS ANNE WAS STILL THERE TO BE SURE AND IF SHE TOO HAD GONE
3843-176666-0036 THE QUIET SMILE OF THAT ASTUTE YOUNG WOMAN HAD TOLD HALE PLAINLY AND SOMEWHAT TO HIS EMBARRASSMENT THAT SHE KNEW SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED BETWEEN THE TWO BUT THAT SMILE SHE NEVER GAVE TO JUNE
3843-176666-0037 INDEED SHE NEVER ENCOUNTERED AUGHT ELSE THAN THE SAME SILENT SEARCHING GAZE FROM THE STRANGELY MATURE LITTLE CREATURE'S EYES AND WHEN THOSE EYES MET THE TEACHER'S ALWAYS JUNE'S HAND WOULD WANDER UNCONSCIOUSLY TO THE LITTLE CROSS AT HER THROAT
3843-176666-0038 AND THE PINK FLECKED LAURELS WERE IN BLOOM WHEN JUNE FARED FORTH ONE SUNNY MORNING OF HER OWN BIRTH MONTH BEHIND OLD JUDD TOLLIVER HOME BACK UP THROUGH THE WILD GAP THEY RODE IN SILENCE PAST BEE ROCK
3843-176666-0039 OUT OF THE CHASM AND UP THE LITTLE VALLEY TOWARD THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE INTO WHICH THE FATHER'S OLD SORREL NAG WITH A SWITCH OF HER SUNBURNT TAIL TURNED LEFTWARD JUNE LEANED FORWARD A LITTLE
3843-176666-0040 AND THERE WAS THE CREST OF THE BIG TREE MOTIONLESS IN THE BLUE HIGH ABOVE AND SHELTERED BY ONE BIG WHITE CLOUD IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD SEEN THE PINE SINCE SHE HAD FIRST LEFT IT
3843-176666-0041 AND LITTLE TREMBLINGS WENT THROUGH HER FROM HER BARE FEET TO HER BONNETED HEAD THUS WAS SHE UNCLAD FOR HALE HAD TOLD HER THAT TO AVOID CRITICISM SHE MUST GO HOME CLOTHED JUST AS SHE WAS WHEN SHE LEFT LONESOME COVE
3843-176666-0042 SHE DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT AND SHE CARRIED HER NEW CLOTHES IN A BUNDLE IN HER LAP BUT SHE TOOK HALE'S WORD UNQUESTIONED SO SHE WORE HER CRIMSON HOMESPUN AND HER BONNET
3843-176666-0043 WITH HER BRONZE GOLD HAIR GATHERED UNDER IT IN THE SAME OLD PSYCHE KNOT SHE MUST WEAR HER SHOES SHE TOLD HALE UNTIL SHE GOT OUT OF TOWN ELSE SOMEONE MIGHT SEE HER BUT HALE HAD SAID SHE WOULD BE LEAVING TOO EARLY FOR THAT
3843-176666-0044 AND SO SHE HAD GONE FROM THE GAP AS SHE HAD COME INTO IT WITH UNMITTENED HANDS AND BARE FEET THE SOFT WIND WAS VERY GOOD TO THOSE DANGLING FEET AND SHE ITCHED TO HAVE THEM ON THE GREEN GRASS OR IN THE COOL WATERS
3843-176666-0045 TIME WINGS SLOWLY FOR THE YOUNG AND WHEN THE SENSATIONS ARE MANY AND THE EXPERIENCES ARE NEW SLOWLY EVEN FOR ALL AND THUS THERE WAS A DOUBLE REASON WHY IT SEEMED AN AGE TO JUNE SINCE HER EYES HAD LAST RESTED ON THE BIG PINE
3843-176666-0046 WHERE HALE HAD PUT HIS BIG BLACK HORSE INTO A DEAD RUN AND AS VIVID A THRILL OF IT CAME BACK TO HER NOW AS HAD BEEN THE THRILL OF THE RACE THEN THEY BEGAN TO CLIMB LABORIOUSLY UP THE ROCKY CREEK THE WATER SINGING A JOYOUS WELCOME TO HER ALONG THE PATH
3843-176666-0047 FERNS AND FLOWERS NODDING TO HER FROM DEAD LEAVES AND RICH MOULD AND PEEPING AT HER FROM CREVICES BETWEEN THE ROCKS ON THE CREEK BANKS AS HIGH UP AS THE LEVEL OF HER EYES UP UNDER BENDING BRANCHES FULL LEAFED
3843-176666-0048 AND MAKING A PLAYFELLOW OF HER SUNNY HAIR
3843-176666-0049 HAD SLID FROM HIS HORSE AND STORMED WITH TEARS WHAT A LITTLE FOOL SHE HAD BEEN WHEN HALE HAD MEANT ONLY TO BE KIND HE WAS NEVER ANYTHING BUT KIND JACK WAS DEAR DEAR JACK THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN NO MORE SHE THOUGHT
3843-176666-0050 AND STRAIGHTWAY SHE CORRECTED THAT THOUGHT IT WON'T HAPPEN ANY MORE SHE SAID ALOUD WHUT'D YOU SAY JUNE THE OLD MAN LIFTED HIS BUSHY BEARD FROM HIS CHEST AND TURNED HIS HEAD NOTHIN DAD
3843-176666-0051 SHE SAID AND OLD JUDD HIMSELF IN A DEEP STUDY DROPPED BACK INTO IT AGAIN HOW OFTEN SHE HAD SAID THAT TO HERSELF THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN NO MORE SHE HAD STOPPED SAYING IT TO HALE BECAUSE HE LAUGHED AND FORGAVE HER
3843-176666-0052 AND SEEMED TO LOVE HER MOOD WHETHER SHE CRIED FROM JOY OR ANGER AND YET SHE KEPT ON DOING BOTH JUST THE SAME SEVERAL TIMES DEVIL JUDD STOPPED TO LET HIS HORSE REST AND EACH TIME OF COURSE THE WOODED SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAINS
3843-176666-0053 AND ACROSS THE WIDENING VALLEY THE TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS BEYOND DROPPED NEARER TO THE STRAIGHT LEVEL OF HER EYES WHILE BEYOND THEM VASTER BLUE BULKS BECAME VISIBLE AND RAN ON AND ON AS THEY ALWAYS SEEMED
3843-176666-0054 TO THE FARTHEST LIMITS OF THE WORLD EVEN OUT THERE HALE HAD TOLD HER SHE WOULD GO SOME DAY THE LAST CURVING UP SWEEP CAME FINALLY AND THERE STOOD THE BIG PINE MAJESTIC UNCHANGED
3843-176666-0055 AND MURMURING IN THE WIND LIKE THE UNDERTONE OF A FAR OFF SEA AS THEY PASSED THE BASE OF IT SHE REACHED OUT HER HAND AND LET THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS BRUSH CARESSINGLY ACROSS ITS TRUNK TURNED QUICKLY
3843-176666-0056 AND THEN THE TWO PASSED INTO A GREEN GLOOM OF SHADOW AND THICK LEAVES THAT SHUT HER HEART IN AS SUDDENLY AS THOUGH SOME HUMAN HAND HAD CLUTCHED IT SHE WAS GOING HOME TO SEE BUB AND LORETTA AND UNCLE BILLY AND OLD HON
3843-176666-0057 AND HER STEP MOTHER AND DAVE AND YET SHE FELT VAGUELY TROUBLED THE VALLEY ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS IN DAZZLING SUNSHINE SHE HAD SEEN THAT THE SUN MUST STILL BE SHINING OVER THERE IT MUST BE SHINING ABOVE HER OVER HERE
3843-176666-0058 BUT THE MOOD WAS GONE WHEN THEY EMERGED AT THE DEADENING ON THE LAST SPUR AND SHE SAW LONESOME COVE AND THE ROOF OF HER LITTLE HOME PEACEFULLY ASLEEP IN THE SAME SUN THAT SHONE ON THE VALLEY OVER THE MOUNTAIN
3843-176666-0059 COLOUR CAME TO HER FACE AND HER HEART BEAT FASTER AT THE FOOT OF THE SPUR THE ROAD HAD BEEN WIDENED AND SHOWED SIGNS OF HEAVY HAULING THERE WAS SAWDUST IN THE MOUTH OF THE CREEK AND FROM COAL DUST THE WATER WAS BLACK
3843-176666-0060 THE RING OF AXES AND THE SHOUTS OF OX DRIVERS CAME FROM THE MOUNTAIN SIDE UP THE CREEK ABOVE HER FATHER'S CABIN THREE OR FOUR HOUSES WERE BEING BUILT OF FRESH BOARDS AND THERE IN FRONT OF HER WAS A NEW STORE
3843-176666-0061 TO A FENCE ONE SIDE OF IT TWO HORSES WERE HITCHED AND ON ONE HORSE WAS A SIDE SADDLE BEFORE THE DOOR STOOD THE RED FOX AND UNCLE BILLY THE MILLER WHO PEERED AT HER FOR A MOMENT THROUGH HIS BIG SPECTACLES
3843-176666-0062 AND GAVE HER A WONDERING SHOUT OF WELCOME THAT BROUGHT HER COUSIN LORETTA TO THE DOOR
3843-176666-0063 AND JUNE SAW HIS FACE DARKEN WHILE SHE LOOKED WHY HONEY SAID THE OLD MILLER HAVE YE REALLY COME HOME AGIN WHILE LORETTA SIMPLY SAID MY LORD AND CAME OUT AND STOOD WITH HER HANDS ON HER HIPS LOOKING AT JUNE
3843-176666-0064 WHY YE AIN'T A BIT CHANGED I KNOWED YE WASN'T GOIN TO PUT ON NO AIRS LIKE DAVE THAR SAID SHE TURNED ON DAVE WHO WITH A SURLY SHRUG WHEELED AND WENT BACK INTO THE STORE UNCLE BILLY WAS GOING HOME COME DOWN TO SEE US RIGHT AWAY NOW HE CALLED BACK
3843-176666-0065 ALL RIGHT UNCLE BILLY SAID JUNE EARLY TERMORRER THE RED FOX DID NOT OPEN HIS LIPS BUT HIS PALE EYES SEARCHED THE GIRL FROM HEAD TO FOOT GIT DOWN JUNE SAID LORETTA AND I'LL WALK UP TO THE HOUSE WITH YE
3843-176666-0066 JUNE SLID DOWN DEVIL JUDD STARTED THE OLD HORSE AND AS THE TWO GIRLS WITH THEIR ARMS ABOUT EACH OTHER'S WAISTS FOLLOWED THE WOLFISH SIDE OF THE RED FOX'S FACE LIFTED IN AN IRONICAL SNARL
3843-176666-0067 BUB WAS STANDING AT THE GATE AND WHEN HE SAW HIS FATHER RIDING HOME ALONE HIS WISTFUL EYES FILLED AND HIS CRY OF DISAPPOINTMENT BROUGHT THE STEP MOTHER TO THE DOOR WHAR'S JUNE HE CRIED AND JUNE HEARD HIM
3843-176666-0068 AND LOOSENING HERSELF FROM LORETTA SHE RAN ROUND THE HORSE AND HAD BUB IN HER ARMS THEN SHE LOOKED UP INTO THE EYES OF HER STEP MOTHER THE OLD WOMAN'S FACE LOOKED KIND SO KIND
3843-176666-0069 THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE JUNE DID WHAT HER FATHER COULD NEVER GET HER TO DO SHE CALLED HER MAMMY AND THEN SHE GAVE THAT OLD WOMAN THE SURPRISE OF HER LIFE SHE KISSED HER RIGHT AWAY SHE MUST SEE EVERYTHING AND BUB IN ECSTASY
3843-176666-0070 WANTED TO PILOT HER AROUND TO SEE THE NEW CALF AND THE NEW PIGS AND THE NEW CHICKENS BUT DUMBLY JUNE LOOKED TO A MIRACLE THAT HAD COME TO PASS TO THE LEFT OF THE CABIN
