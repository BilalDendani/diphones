803-139743-0005 COMING OUT FROM THE CAVERN THAT WAS HIS HOME WENT FOR THE FIRST TIME OVER THE LITTLE STREAM AND GOING ROUND THE CORNER OF THE CRAGS SAW GLITTERING BENEATH HIM THE MUNDANE PLAIN
803-139743-0006 AND THE WIND OF THE AUTUMN THAT WAS GILDING THE WORLD RUSHING UP THE SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAIN BEAT COLD ON HIS NAKED FLANKS HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND SNORTED I AM A MAN HORSE NOW HE SHOUTED ALOUD
803-139743-0007 AND LEAPING FROM CRAG TO CRAG HE GALLOPED BY VALLEY AND CHASM BY TORRENT BED AND SCAR OF AVALANCHE UNTIL HE CAME TO THE WANDERING LEAGUES OF THE PLAIN AND LEFT BEHIND HIM FOR EVER
803-139743-0008 HIS GOAL WAS ZRETAZOOLA THE CITY OF SOMBELENE WHAT LEGEND OF SOMBELENE'S INHUMAN BEAUTY OR OF THE WONDER OF HER MYSTERY HAD EVER FLOATED OVER THE MUNDANE PLAIN
803-139743-0009 AND ONLY CONFIDED SECRETLY TO THE BAT FOR SHEPPERALK WAS MORE LEGENDARY EVEN THAN MAN CERTAIN IT WAS THAT HE HEADED FROM THE FIRST FOR THE CITY OF ZRETAZOOLA WHERE SOMBELENE IN HER TEMPLE DWELT
803-139743-0010 THOUGH ALL THE MUNDANE PLAIN ITS RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS LAY BETWEEN SHEPPERALK'S HOME AND THE CITY HE SOUGHT WHEN FIRST THE FEET OF THE CENTAUR TOUCHED THE GRASS OF THAT SOFT ALLUVIAL EARTH
803-139743-0011 HE BLEW FOR JOY UPON THE SILVER HORN HE PRANCED AND CARACOLED
803-139743-0012 PACE CAME TO HIM LIKE A MAIDEN WITH A LAMP A NEW AND BEAUTIFUL WONDER THE WIND LAUGHED AS IT PASSED HIM HE PUT HIS HEAD DOWN LOW TO THE SCENT OF THE FLOWERS HE LIFTED IT UP TO BE NEARER THE UNSEEN STARS

803-139743-0014 TO SING IN SOME CITY'S SPIRES BEFORE DAYLIGHT COMES HE WAS THE SWORN COMPANION OF THE WIND FOR JOY HE WAS AS A SONG THE LIGHTNINGS OF HIS LEGENDARY SIRES THE EARLIER GODS
803-139743-0015 BEGAN TO MIX WITH HIS BLOOD HIS HOOVES THUNDERED HE CAME TO THE CITIES OF MEN AND ALL MEN TREMBLED FOR THEY REMEMBERED THE ANCIENT MYTHICAL WARS AND NOW THEY DREADED NEW BATTLES AND FEARED FOR THE RACE OF MAN
803-139743-0016 HISTORY DOES NOT KNOW THEM BUT WHAT OF THAT NOT ALL OF US HAVE SAT AT HISTORIANS FEET BUT ALL HAVE LEARNED FABLE AND MYTH AT THEIR MOTHERS KNEES
803-139743-0017 AND THERE WERE NONE THAT DID NOT FEAR STRANGE WARS WHEN THEY SAW SHEPPERALK SWERVE AND LEAP ALONG THE PUBLIC WAYS SO HE PASSED FROM CITY TO CITY BY NIGHT HE LAY DOWN UNPANTING IN THE REEDS OF SOME MARSH OR A FOREST
803-139743-0018 BEFORE DAWN HE ROSE TRIUMPHANT AND HUGELY DRANK OF SOME RIVER IN THE DARK AND SPLASHING OUT OF IT
803-139743-0019 AND TO SEND ECHOING EASTWARDS THE EXULTANT GREETINGS OF HIS JUBILANT HORN AND LO THE SUNRISE COMING UP FROM THE ECHOES AND THE PLAINS NEW LIT BY THE DAY AND THE LEAGUES SPINNING BY LIKE WATER FLUNG FROM A TOP

803-139743-0023 WHO LIVE BY THE EDGES OF THE MUNDANE PLAIN AND FROM THEM HE CAME TO THE LANDS OF LEGEND AGAIN SUCH AS THOSE IN WHICH HE WAS CRADLED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD AND WHICH FRINGE THE MARGE OF THE WORLD AND MIX WITH THE TWILIGHT
803-139743-0024 HE GALLOPED ON INTO THEIR GOLDEN MIST AND WHEN IT HID FROM HIS EYES THE SIGHT OF THINGS THE DREAMS IN HIS HEART AWOKE AND ROMANTICALLY HE PONDERED ALL THOSE RUMOURS THAT USED TO COME TO HIM FROM SOMBELENE
803-139743-0025 BECAUSE OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF FABULOUS THINGS SHE DWELT SAID EVENING SECRETLY TO THE BAT IN A LITTLE TEMPLE BY A LONE LAKESHORE A GROVE OF CYPRESSES SCREENED HER FROM THE CITY FROM ZRETAZOOLA OF THE CLIMBING WAYS
803-139743-0026 FOR ONLY HER BEAUTY AND HER LINEAGE WERE DIVINE HER FATHER HAD BEEN HALF CENTAUR AND HALF GOD HER MOTHER WAS THE CHILD OF A DESERT LION AND THAT SPHINX THAT WATCHES THE PYRAMIDS
803-139743-0027 SHE WAS MORE MYSTICAL THAN WOMAN HER BEAUTY WAS AS A DREAM WAS AS A SONG THE ONE DREAM OF A LIFETIME DREAMED ON ENCHANTED DEWS
803-139743-0028 BLOWN FAR FROM HIS NATIVE COASTS BY STORM IN PARADISE DAWN AFTER DAWN ON MOUNTAINS OF ROMANCE OR TWILIGHT AFTER TWILIGHT COULD NEVER EQUAL HER BEAUTY ALL THE GLOW WORMS HAD NOT THE SECRET AMONG THEM
803-139743-0029 THE LIONS CAME NOT TO WOO HER BECAUSE THEY FEARED HER STRENGTH AND THE GODS DARED NOT LOVE HER BECAUSE THEY KNEW SHE MUST DIE THIS WAS WHAT EVENING HAD WHISPERED TO THE BAT
803-139743-0030 THIS WAS THE DREAM IN THE HEART OF SHEPPERALK AS HE CANTERED BLIND THROUGH THE MIST AND SUDDENLY THERE AT HIS HOOVES IN THE DARK OF THE PLAIN APPEARED THE CLEFT IN THE LEGENDARY LANDS AND ZRETAZOOLA SHELTERING IN THE CLEFT
803-139743-0031 AND ONLY SEEING DIMLY THROUGH HIS LASHES SEIZED SOMBELENE BY THE HAIR
803-139743-0032 AND SO HALED HER AWAY AND LEAPING WITH HER OVER THE FLOORLESS CHASM WHERE THE WATERS OF THE LAKE FALL UNREMEMBERED AWAY INTO A HOLE IN THE WORLD TOOK HER WE KNOW NOT WHERE
803-139743-0033 TO BE HER SLAVE FOR ALL CENTURIES THAT ARE ALLOWED TO HIS RACE
