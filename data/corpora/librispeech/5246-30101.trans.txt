5246-30101-0000 CHAPTER SIX PEGGY PRESENTS HIS BILL MILLVILLE WAITED IN AGONIZED SUSPENSE FOR THREE DAYS FOR TANGIBLE EVIDENCE THAT THE NABOB WAS IN THEIR MIDST AS NIB CORKINS POETICALLY EXPRESSED IT
5246-30101-0001 BUT THE CITY FOLKS SEEMED GLUED TO THE FARM AND NO ONE OF THEM HAD YET APPEARED IN THE VILLAGE AS A MATTER OF FACT
5246-30101-0002 FAR UP IN THE PINE WOODS AND HAVING THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES IN SPITE OF THEIR SCANT SUCCESS IN CAPTURING TROUT OLD HUCKS COULD GO OUT BEFORE BREAKFAST AND BRING IN AN AMPLE SUPPLY OF SPECKLED BEAUTIES FOR MARY TO FRY
5246-30101-0003 BUT UNCLE JOHN'S SPLENDID OUTFIT SEEMED SCORNED BY THE FINNY FOLK AND AFTER GETTING HER DRESS TORN IN SUNDRY PLACES AND A HOOK IN THE FLESHY PART OF HER ARM PATSY LEARNED TO SEEK SHELTER BEHIND A TREE WHENEVER HER UNCLE CAST HIS FLY
5246-30101-0004 BUT THEY REVELED IN THE WOODS AND WOULD LIE ON THE BANK FOR HOURS LISTENING TO THE MURMUR OF THE BROOK AND THE SONGS OF THE BIRDS THE TEMPER OF THE OTHER TWO GIRLS WAS DIFFERENT BETH DE GRAF HAD BROUGHT ALONG AN ARCHERY OUTFIT
5246-30101-0005 AND SHE SET UP HER TARGET ON THE AMPLE GREEN THE DAY FOLLOWING HER ARRIVAL HERE SHE PRACTICED PERSISTENTLY SHOOTING AT SIXTY YARDS WITH MUCH SKILL BUT OCCASIONALLY WHEN LOUISE TIRED OF HER NOVEL AND HER CUSHIONS IN THE HAMMOCK
5246-30101-0006 THE TWO GIRLS WOULD PLAY TENNIS OR CROQUET TOGETHER BETH INVARIABLY WINNING SUCH DELIGHTFUL LAZINESS COULD BROOK NO INTERFERENCE FOR THE FIRST DAYS OF THEIR ARRIVAL AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL PEGGY MC NUTT VENTURED OVER ON MONDAY MORNING
5246-30101-0007 FOR A SETTLEMENT WITH MISTER MERRICK THAT ANY FROM THE LITTLE WORLD AROUND THEM DARED INTRUDE UPON THE DWELLERS AT THE WEGG FARM ALTHOUGH THE AGENT HAD BEEN LATE IN STARTING FROM MILLVILLE
5246-30101-0008 AND NICK THORNE'S SORREL MARE HAD WALKED EVERY STEP OF THE WAY PEGGY WAS OBLIGED TO WAIT IN THE YARD A GOOD HALF HOUR FOR THE NABOB TO FINISH HIS BREAKFAST DURING THAT TIME HE TRIED TO DECIDE
5246-30101-0009 HE HAD LEARNED FROM THE LIVERYMAN AT THE JUNCTION THAT MISTER MERRICK HAD PAID FIVE DOLLARS FOR A TRIP THAT WAS USUALLY MADE FOR TWO AND ALSO THAT THE EXTRAVAGANT MAN HAD PAID SEVENTY FIVE CENTS MORE TO LUCKY TODD THE HOTEL KEEPER THAN HIS BILL CAME TO
5246-30101-0010 THE KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH RECKLESS EXPENDITURES HAD FORTIFIED LITTLE MC NUTT IN MARKING UP THE ACCOUNT OF THE MONEY HE HAD RECEIVED AND INSTEAD OF CHARGING TWO DOLLARS A DAY FOR HIS OWN SERVICES
5246-30101-0011 HE PUT THEM DOWN AT THREE DOLLARS A DAY AND MADE THE DAYS STRETCH AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ALSO HE CHARGED A ROUND COMMISSION ON THE WAGES OF LON TAFT AND NED LONG AND DOUBLED THE LIVERYMAN'S BILL FOR HAULING THE GOODS OVER FROM THE JUNCTION
5246-30101-0012 ETHEL THOMPSON HAD REFUSED TO ACCEPT ANY PAYMENT FOR WHAT SHE HAD DONE BUT PEGGY BRAVELY CHARGED IT UP AT GOOD ROUND FIGURES WHEN THE BILL WAS MADE OUT AND FIGURED UP
5246-30101-0013 BUT AT THE LAST HIS HEART FAILED HIM AND HE MADE OUT ANOTHER BILL MORE MODEST IN ITS EXTORTIONS HE HAD BROUGHT THEM BOTH ALONG THOUGH ONE IN EACH POCKET VACILLATING BETWEEN THEM AS HE THOUGHT FIRST OF THE MERRICK MILLIONS
5246-30101-0014 AND THEN OF THE RIGHTEOUS ANGER HE MIGHT INCUR BY THE TIME UNCLE JOHN CAME OUT TO HIM SMILING AND CORDIAL HE HAD NOT THOROUGHLY MADE UP HIS MIND WHICH ACCOUNT TO PRESENT
