8470-279797-0000 THE PRINCE ON HIS PART CAME HOME ALSO VERY MUCH WEARIED AND VEXED BECAFICO HE SAID
8470-279797-0001 SHE HAS SLIPPED FROM ME TIME AFTER TIME WITH THE MOST WONDROUS ADROITNESS YET MY ARROWS WERE SO TRUE THAT I MARVEL HOW SHE ESCAPED AT DAWN TO MORROW I MUST BE AFTER HER ONCE MORE
8470-279797-0002 SO HE DID NOT FAIL TO GO AT EARLIEST DAWN TO HER HIDING PLACE BUT THE HIND TOOK CARE NOT TO RE VISIT HER FAVOURITE HAUNT HE SOUGHT HER EVERYWHERE AND COULD SEE NOTHING THEN
8470-279797-0003 BEING VERY TIRED AND HOT HE GATHERED SOME LUSCIOUS APPLES WHICH HE SAW HANGING UPON A TREE OVER HIS HEAD AS SOON AS HE ATE THEM HE FELL FAST ASLEEP MEANTIME THE HIND ROAMING STEALTHILY ABOUT
8470-279797-0004 CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE HE LAY CAME QUITE SUDDENLY
8470-279797-0005 BUT NOW SEEING HER ENEMY SOUND ASLEEP SHE PAUSED A MINUTE TO LOOK AT HIM AND IN HIS FEATURES WASTED WITH GRIEF BUT STILL SO LOVEABLE AND BEAUTIFUL SHE RECOGNISED THE FACE WHICH HAD LONG BEEN ENGRAVEN ON HER HEART THE POOR HIND
8470-279797-0006 HER EYES BEAMING WITH JOY THEN SHE SIGHED AT LENGTH BECOME BOLDER SHE APPROACHED NEARER AND SOFTLY TOUCHED HIM WITH HER FORE FOOT AWAKING
8470-279797-0007 WHAT WAS THE PRINCE'S SURPRISE TO SEE BESIDE HIM TAME AND FAMILIAR THE PRETTY CREATURE WHOM HE HAD HUNTED ALL YESTERDAY BUT WHEN HE PUT OUT HIS HAND TO SEIZE HER SHE FLED AWAY LIKE LIGHTNING HE FOLLOWED WITH ALL THE SPEED HE COULD AND THUS
8470-279797-0008 SHE FLYING AND HE PURSUING THEY PASSED THE WHOLE DAY TOWARDS EVENING HER STRENGTH FAILED AND WHEN THE HUNTER CAME UP TO HER IT WAS A POOR HALF DYING DEER THAT HE FOUND LYING ON THE GRASS SHE THOUGHT HER DEATH WAS CERTAIN STILL
8470-279797-0009 FROM HIS HANDS IT DID NOT SEEM SO TERRIBLE AS FROM ANY ONE ELSE BUT INSTEAD OF KILLING HER HE CARESSED HER BEAUTIFUL HIND SAID HE DO NOT BE AFRAID I ONLY WISH TO TAKE YOU HOME WITH ME AND HAVE YOU WITH ME ALWAYS
8470-279797-0010 HE CUT BRANCHES OF TREES WOVE THEM INGENIOUSLY INTO A SORT OF COUCH WHICH HE STREWED WITH ROSES AND MOSS THEN TOOK THE CREATURE IN HIS ARMS LAID HER GENTLY DOWN UPON THEM
8470-279797-0011 AND SAT BESIDE HER FEEDING HER FROM TIME TO TIME WITH THE SOFTEST GRASS HE COULD FIND SHE ATE CONTENTEDLY FROM HIS HAND AND HE ALMOST FANCIED SHE UNDERSTOOD ALL THE SWEET THINGS HE SAID TO HER
8470-279797-0012 AND SO TIME PASSED TILL IT GREW DUSK MY PRETTY HIND SAID HE I WILL GO IN SEARCH OF A STREAM WHERE YOU CAN DRINK AND THEN WE WILL TAKE OUR WAY HOME TOGETHER
8470-279797-0013 BUT WHILE HE WAS ABSENT SHE STOLE AWAY AND HAD ONLY TIME TO REACH THE COTTAGE WHEN THE TRANSFORMATION HAPPENED AND IT WAS NOT A HIND BUT A WEEPING PRINCESS WHO THREW HERSELF ON THE BED BESIDE THE FAITHFUL GILLIFLOWER I HAVE SEEN HIM SHE CRIED
8470-279797-0014 HE WAS THE HUNTER WHO HAS PURSUED ME THESE TWO DAYS AND HAS TAKEN ME AT LAST BUT HE DID NOT SLAY ME HE SAVED AND CARESSED ME AH HE IS GENTLER AND SWEETER EVEN THAN THE IMAGE IN MY HEART HERE SHE BEGAN AGAIN TO WEEP
8470-279797-0015 BUT GILLIFLOWER CONSOLED HER AND THEY WENT TO SLEEP WONDERING MUCH HOW THIS ADVENTURE WOULD END THE PRINCE RETURNING FROM THE STREAM MISSED HIS BEAUTIFUL WHITE HIND AND CAME BACK TO BECAFICO FULL OF GRIEF
8470-279797-0016 MINGLED WITH A CERTAIN ANGER AT THE INGRATITUDE OF THE CREATURE TO WHOM HE HAD BEEN SO KIND BUT AT BREAK OF DAY HE ROSE DETERMINED AGAIN TO PURSUE HER
8470-279797-0017 TOOK A QUITE DIFFERENT ROUTE STILL
8470-279797-0018 SEIZED BY AN IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE HE SHOT AN ARROW AFTER HER IT STRUCK HER SHE FELT A VIOLENT PAIN DART THROUGH ONE OF HER SLENDER LIMBS AND FELL HELPLESS ON THE GRASS WHEN THE PRINCE CAME UP TO HER HE WAS OVERCOME WITH REMORSE FOR HIS CRUELTY
8470-279797-0019 MADE HER A BED OF BRANCHES AND MOSS LAID HER HEAD UPON HIS KNEES AND WEPT OVER HER MY LOVELY HIND SAID HE WHY DID I WOUND YOU SO CRUELLY YOU WILL HATE ME WHEN I WISH YOU TO LOVE ME
8470-279797-0020 SO HE TENDED AND CHERISHED HER ALL DAY AND TOWARDS NIGHTFALL
8470-279797-0021 BUT SHE STRUGGLED WITH HIM AND THE STRUGGLE WAS SO SORE THAT GILLIFLOWER COMING OUT IN SEARCH OF HER DEAR MISTRESS HEARD THE RUSTLING AND SAW HER HIND IN THE HUNTER'S POWER SHE RUSHED TO RESCUE HER TO THE PRINCE'S GREAT ASTONISHMENT

8470-279797-0029 AND BEHELD A WONDERFUL SIGHT THERE SAT THE FAIREST PRINCESS IN ALL THE WORLD ATTIRED IN A ROBE OF SILVER BROCADE HER HAIR FALLING IN LONG CURLS AND HER EYES SPARKLING THROUGH TEARS GILLIFLOWER KNELT BEFORE HER
8470-279797-0030 BINDING UP HER BEAUTIFUL ARM FROM WHICH THE BLOOD WAS FLOWING DO NOT HEED IT SIGHED THE PRINCESS BETTER LET ME DIE FOR DEATH ITSELF WOULD BE SWEETER THAN THE LIFE I LEAD ALAS
8470-279797-0031 HOW HARD IT IS TO BE A HIND ALL DAY TO SEE MY BETROTHED TO FEEL HIS TENDERNESS AND GOODNESS YET BE UNABLE TO SPEAK TO HIM
8470-279797-0032 WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE HIS ASTONISHMENT AND DELIGHT HE RAN TOWARDS THE PRINCE WHO SAT MOODILY AT THE WINDOW SIR CRIED HE ONLY LOOK THROUGH THIS HOLE AND YOU WILL SEE THE ORIGINAL OF THE PORTRAIT WHICH SO FASCINATED YOU
8470-279797-0033 THE PRINCE LOOKED AND RECOGNISED AT ONCE HIS BELOVED PRINCESS HE WOULD HAVE DIED WITH JOY HAD HE NOT BELIEVED HIMSELF DECEIVED BY SOME ENCHANTMENT HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR GILLIFLOWER OPENED IT HE ENTERED
8470-279797-0034 AND THREW HIMSELF AT THE FEET OF DESIREE WHAT FOLLOWED OF EXPLANATIONS
8470-279797-0035 NOT EVEN BY GILLIFLOWER AND BECAFICO WHO WERE PRESENT BUT WHO CONSIDERATELY DREW ASIDE AND SPENT THE TIME IN CONVERSING WITH ONE ANOTHER SO PASSED THE NIGHT AND ANXIOUSLY THEY AWAITED FOR THE DAWN
8470-279797-0036 TO SEE WHETHER THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS WOULD AGAIN BECOME A HIND OF THE FOREST BUT THE DAY BROKE GREW CLEARER BRIGHTENED INTO SUNRISE AND THE PRINCESS WITH THE PRINCE SITTING BESIDE HER REMAINED A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN STILL
8470-279797-0037 THEN CAME A KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND THERE ENTERED THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN SUCH A KIND HOSTESS FOR ALL THIS WHILE THE PERIOD OF ENCHANTMENT IS ENDED MY CHILDREN SAID SHE GO HOME AND BE HAPPY
8470-279797-0038 AND THEN THEY KNEW HER AS NO LONGER THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN BUT THE FAIRY TULIP WHO HAD THUS FAITHFULLY WATCHED HER CHARGE SO THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM RETURNED TO THEIR CAPITAL
8470-279797-0039 WHERE THE MARRIAGE WAS SOLEMNIZED WITH ALL SPLENDOUR AND AT DESIREE'S REQUEST LONGTHORN AND HER MOTHER WHO HAD BEEN IMPRISONED BY THE OLD KING'S ORDER
8470-279797-0040 THAN BANISHMENT TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY
8470-279797-0041 AS FOR THE FAITHFUL GILLIFLOWER SHE STAYED AT COURT WITH HER BELOVED MISTRESS AND BECAME THE WIFE OF THE EQUALLY FAITHFUL BECAFICO
8470-279797-0042 THE TWO WERE LADEN WITH WEALTH AND HONOURS AND SHARED THE HAPPINESS OF THE OTHER TWO LOVERS WHICH WAS AS GREAT AS ANY MORTAL COULD DESIRE
