4591-14356-0000 CHARLEMAGNE SUCCEEDED IN ALL HIS ATTEMPTS AND COMPELLED MARSILIUS TO SUBMIT AND PAY TRIBUTE TO FRANCE OUR READERS WILL REMEMBER GANO OTHERWISE CALLED GAN OR GANELON
4591-14356-0001 WHOM WE MENTIONED IN ONE OF OUR EARLY CHAPTERS AS AN OLD COURTIER OF CHARLEMAGNE AND A DEADLY ENEMY OF ORLANDO RINALDO AND ALL THEIR FRIENDS HE HAD GREAT INFLUENCE OVER CHARLES
4591-14356-0002 FROM EQUALITY OF AGE AND LONG INTIMACY AND HE WAS NOT WITHOUT GOOD QUALITIES HE WAS BRAVE AND SAGACIOUS BUT ENVIOUS FALSE AND TREACHEROUS
4591-14356-0003 TO ARRANGE THE TRIBUTE HE EMBRACED ORLANDO OVER AND OVER AGAIN AT TAKING LEAVE USING SUCH PAINS TO SEEM LOVING AND SINCERE THAT
4591-14356-0004 BUT THE OLD MONARCH HE FASTENED WITH EQUAL TENDERNESS ON OLIVER WHO SMILED CONTEMPTUOUSLY IN HIS FACE AND THOUGHT TO HIMSELF YOU MAY MAKE AS MANY FAIR SPEECHES AS YOU CHOOSE BUT YOU LIE
4591-14356-0005 ALL THE OTHER PALADINS WHO WERE PRESENT THOUGHT THE SAME AND THEY SAID AS MUCH TO THE EMPEROR ADDING THAT GAN SHOULD ON NO ACCOUNT BE SENT AMBASSADOR TO THE SPANIARDS BUT CHARLES WAS INFATUATED
4591-14356-0006 GAN WAS RECEIVED WITH GREAT HONOR BY MARSILIUS THE KING ATTENDED BY HIS LORDS CAME FIFTEEN MILES OUT OF SARAGOSSA TO MEET HIM AND THEN CONDUCTED HIM INTO THE CITY WITH ACCLAMATIONS
4591-14356-0007 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR SEVERAL DAYS BUT BALLS GAMES AND EXHIBITIONS OF CHIVALRY THE LADIES THROWING FLOWERS ON THE HEADS OF THE FRENCH KNIGHTS AND THE PEOPLE SHOUTING FRANCE MOUNTJOY AND SAINT DENIS
4591-14356-0008 AFTER THE CEREMONIES OF THE FIRST RECEPTION THE KING AND THE AMBASSADOR BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER ONE DAY THEY SAT TOGETHER IN A GARDEN ON THE BORDER OF A FOUNTAIN THE WATER WAS SO CLEAR AND SMOOTH IT REFLECTED EVERY OBJECT AROUND
4591-14356-0009 AND THE SPOT WAS ENCIRCLED WITH FRUIT TREES WHICH QUIVERED WITH THE FRESH AIR AS THEY SAT AND TALKED AS IF WITHOUT RESTRAINT GAN WITHOUT LOOKING THE KING IN THE FACE WAS ENABLED TO SEE THE EXPRESSION OF HIS COUNTENANCE IN THE WATER
4591-14356-0010 AND GOVERNED HIS SPEECH ACCORDINGLY MARSILIUS WAS EQUALLY ADROIT AND WATCHED THE FACE OF GAN WHILE HE ADDRESSED HIM MARSILIUS BEGAN BY LAMENTING NOT AS TO THE AMBASSADOR BUT AS TO THE FRIEND
4591-14356-0011 CHARGING HIM WITH WISHING TO TAKE HIS KINGDOM FROM HIM AND GIVE IT TO ORLANDO TILL AT LENGTH HE PLAINLY UTTERED HIS BELIEF THAT IF THAT AMBITIOUS PALADIN WERE BUT DEAD GOOD MEN WOULD GET THEIR RIGHTS GAN HEAVED A SIGH
4591-14356-0012 AS IF HE WAS UNWILLINGLY COMPELLED TO ALLOW THE FORCE OF WHAT THE KING SAID BUT UNABLE TO CONTAIN HIMSELF LONG HE LIFTED UP HIS FACE RADIANT WITH TRIUMPHANT WICKEDNESS AND EXCLAIMED EVERY WORD YOU UTTER IS TRUTH DIE HE MUST
4591-14356-0013 AND DIE ALSO MUST OLIVER WHO STRUCK ME THAT FOUL BLOW AT COURT IS IT TREACHERY TO PUNISH AFFRONTS LIKE THESE I HAVE PLANNED EVERYTHING I HAVE SETTLED EVERYTHING ALREADY WITH THEIR BESOTTED MASTER ORLANDO
4591-14356-0014 WILL COME TO YOUR BORDERS TO RONCESVALLES FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECEIVING THE TRIBUTE CHARLES WILL AWAIT HIM AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS ORLANDO WILL BRING BUT A SMALL BAND WITH HIM YOU
4591-14356-0015 WHEN YOU MEET HIM WILL HAVE SECRETLY YOUR WHOLE ARMY AT YOUR BACK YOU SURROUND HIM AND WHO RECEIVES TRIBUTE THEN THE NEW JUDAS HAD SCARCELY UTTERED THESE WORDS WHEN HIS EXULTATION WAS INTERRUPTED
4591-14356-0016 BY A CHANGE IN THE FACE OF NATURE THE SKY WAS SUDDENLY OVERCAST THERE WAS THUNDER AND LIGHTNING A LAUREL WAS SPLIT IN TWO FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND THE CAROB TREE UNDER WHICH GAN WAS SITTING
4591-14356-0017 WHICH IS SAID TO BE THE SPECIES OF TREE ON WHICH JUDAS ISCARIOT HUNG HIMSELF DROPPED ONE OF ITS PODS ON HIS HEAD MARSILIUS AS WELL AS GAN WAS APPALLED AT THIS OMEN BUT ON ASSEMBLING HIS SOOTHSAYERS
4591-14356-0018 THEY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE LAUREL TREE TURNED THE OMEN AGAINST THE EMPEROR THE SUCCESSOR OF THE CAESARS THOUGH ONE OF THEM RENEWED THE CONSTERNATION OF GAN BY SAYING THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE TREE OF JUDAS AND INTIMATING
4591-14356-0019 THAT PERHAPS THE AMBASSADOR COULD EXPLAIN IT GAN RELIEVED HIS VEXATION BY ANGER THE HABIT OF WICKEDNESS PREVAILED OVER ALL OTHER CONSIDERATIONS AND THE KING PREPARED TO MARCH TO RONCESVALLES AT THE HEAD OF ALL HIS FORCES
4591-14356-0020 GAN WROTE TO CHARLEMAGNE TO SAY HOW HUMBLY AND SUBMISSIVELY MARSILIUS WAS COMING TO PAY THE TRIBUTE INTO THE HANDS OF ORLANDO AND HOW HANDSOME IT WOULD BE OF THE EMPEROR TO MEET HIM HALF WAY
4591-14356-0021 AND SO BE READY TO RECEIVE HIM AFTER THE PAYMENT AT HIS CAMP HE ADDED A BRILLIANT ACCOUNT OF THE TRIBUTE AND THE ACCOMPANYING PRESENTS THE GOOD EMPEROR WROTE IN TURN TO SAY HOW PLEASED HE WAS WITH THE AMBASSADOR'S DILIGENCE
4591-14356-0022 AND THAT MATTERS WERE ARRANGED PRECISELY AS HE WISHED HIS COURT HOWEVER HAD ITS SUSPICION STILL THOUGH THEY LITTLE THOUGHT GAN'S OBJECT IN BRINGING CHARLES INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF RONCESVALLES
4591-14356-0023 WAS TO DELIVER HIM INTO THE HANDS OF MARSILIUS AFTER ORLANDO SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BY HIM ORLANDO HOWEVER DID AS HIS LORD AND SOVEREIGN DESIRED HE WENT TO RONCESVALLES
4591-14356-0024 ACCOMPANIED BY A MODERATE TRAIN OF WARRIORS NOT DREAMING OF THE ATROCITY THAT AWAITED HIM GAN MEANWHILE HAD HASTENED BACK TO FRANCE IN ORDER TO SHOW HIMSELF FREE AND EASY IN THE PRESENCE OF CHARLES
4591-14356-0025 WHILE MARSILIUS TO MAKE ASSURANCE DOUBLY SURE BROUGHT INTO THE PASSES OF RONCESVALLES NO LESS THAN THREE ARMIES WHICH WERE SUCCESSIVELY TO FALL ON THE PALADIN IN CASE OF THE WORST
4591-14356-0026 AND SO EXTINGUISH HIM WITH NUMBERS HE HAD ALSO BY GAN'S ADVICE BROUGHT HEAPS OF WINE AND GOOD CHEER TO BE SET BEFORE HIS VICTIMS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE FOR THAT SAID THE TRAITOR

4591-14356-0029 GAN WENT AWAY REJOICING TO FRANCE HE EMBRACED THE SOVEREIGN AND THE COURT ALL ROUND WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO HAD BROUGHT THEM NOTHING BUT BLESSINGS AND THE OLD KING WEPT FOR VERY TENDERNESS AND DELIGHT
