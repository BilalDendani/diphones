8591-284445-0000 A BLUE GLOOM HUNG OVER THE CITY WHICH WAS SCARCELY RELIEVED BY A FEW BLUISH WAVERING LIGHTS HERE AND THERE BUT TROT KNEW THE GENERAL DIRECTION IN WHICH THE PALACE LAY AND SHE DECIDED TO GO THERE FIRST
8591-284445-0001 SHE BELIEVED THE BOOLOOROO WOULD SURELY KEEP SO IMPORTANT A PRISONER AS CAP'N BILL LOCKED UP IN HIS OWN PALACE ONCE OR TWICE THE LITTLE GIRL LOST HER WAY FOR THE STREETS WERE VERY PUZZLING TO ONE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO THEM
8591-284445-0002 BUT FINALLY SHE SIGHTED THE GREAT PALACE AND WENT UP TO THE ENTRANCE THERE SHE FOUND A DOUBLE GUARD POSTED THEY WERE SITTING ON A BENCH OUTSIDE THE DOORWAY AND BOTH STOOD UP AS SHE APPROACHED WE THOUGHT WE HEARD FOOTSTEPS SAID ONE
8591-284445-0003 JIMFRED JONESJINKS AND FREDJIM JINKSJONES WHO HAD BEEN TALKING TOGETHER QUITE CHEERFULLY IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THE GIRL HAD SEEN THEM TOGETHER AND SHE MARVELED AT THE QUEER PATCHING THAT HAD SO STRONGLY UNITED THEM YET SO THOROUGHLY SEPARATED THEM
8591-284445-0004 YOU SEE REMARKED JIMFRED AS THEY SEATED THEMSELVES AGAIN UPON THE BENCH THE BOOLOOROO HAS ORDERED THE PATCHING TO TAKE PLACE TO MORROW MORNING AFTER BREAKFAST THE OLD EARTH MAN IS TO BE PATCHED TO POOR TIGGLE INSTEAD OF GHIP GHISIZZLE
8591-284445-0005 WHO HAS IN SOME WAY MANAGED TO ESCAPE FROM THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE NO ONE KNOWS HOW BUT TIGGLE AND TIGGLE WON'T TELL WE'RE SORRY FOR ANYONE WHO HAS TO BE PATCHED REPLIED FREDJIM IN A REFLECTIVE TONE
8591-284445-0006 FOR ALTHOUGH IT DIDN'T HURT US AS MUCH AS WE EXPECTED IT'S A TERRIBLE MIX UP TO BE IN UNTIL WE BECOME USED TO OUR STRANGE COMBINATION YOU AND WE ARE ABOUT ALIKE NOW JIMFRED ALTHOUGH WE WERE SO DIFFERENT BEFORE
8591-284445-0007 NOT SO SAID JIMFRED WE ARE REALLY MORE INTELLIGENT THAN YOU ARE FOR THE LEFT SIDE OF OUR BRAIN WAS ALWAYS THE KEENEST BEFORE WE WERE PATCHED THAT MAY BE ADMITTED FREDJIM
8591-284445-0008 FOR WE HAVE A RIGHT ARM TOO AND IT IS PRETTY STRONG WE WILL TEST IT SUGGESTED THE OTHER BY ALL PULLING UPON ONE END OF THIS BENCH WITH OUR RIGHT ARMS
8591-284445-0009 WHILE THEY WERE TUSSLING AT THE BENCH DRAGGING IT FIRST HERE AND THEN THERE IN THE TRIAL OF STRENGTH TROT OPENED THE DOOR OF THE PALACE AND WALKED IN IT WAS PRETTY DARK IN THE HALL
8591-284445-0010 AND ONLY A FEW DIM BLUE LIGHTS SHOWED AT INTERVALS DOWN THE LONG CORRIDORS AS THE GIRL WALKED THROUGH THESE PASSAGES SHE COULD HEAR SNORES OF VARIOUS DEGREES COMING FROM BEHIND SOME OF THE CLOSED DOORS
8591-284445-0011 AND KNEW THAT ALL THE REGULAR INMATES OF THE PLACE WERE SOUND ASLEEP SO SHE MOUNTED TO THE UPPER FLOOR AND THINKING SHE WOULD BE LIKELY TO FIND CAP'N BILL IN THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE SHE WENT THERE AND TRIED THE DOOR IT WAS LOCKED
8591-284445-0012 BUT THE KEY HAD BEEN LEFT ON THE OUTSIDE SHE WAITED UNTIL THE SENTRY WHO WAS PACING THE CORRIDOR HAD HIS BACK TOWARD HER AND THEN SHE TURNED THE KEY AND SLIPPED WITHIN SOFTLY CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HER
8591-284445-0013 AND TROT DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE A LIGHT AFTER A MOMENT'S THOUGHT SHE BEGAN FEELING HER WAY TO THE WINDOW STUMBLING OVER OBJECTS AS SHE WENT EVERY TIME SHE MADE A NOISE SOME ONE GROANED AND THAT MADE THE CHILD UNEASY
8591-284445-0014 AT LAST SHE FOUND A WINDOW AND MANAGED TO OPEN THE SHUTTERS AND LET THE MOONLIGHT IN
8591-284445-0015 IN THE CENTER STOOD THE GREAT KNIFE WHICH THE BOOLOOROO USED TO SPLIT PEOPLE IN TWO WHEN HE PATCHED THEM AND AT ONE SIDE WAS A DARK FORM HUDDLED UPON THE FLOOR AND SECURELY BOUND TROT HASTENED TO THIS FORM AND KNELT BESIDE IT
8591-284445-0016 BUT WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND IT WAS ONLY TIGGLE THE MAN STIRRED A LITTLE AND ROLLED AGAINST TROT'S KNEE WHEN SHE AT ONCE BECAME VISIBLE TO HIM OH IT'S THE EARTH CHILD SAID HE ARE YOU CONDEMNED TO BE PATCHED TOO LITTLE ONE
8591-284445-0017 NO ANSWERED TROT TELL ME WHERE CAP'N BILL IS I CAN'T SAID TIGGLE THE BOOLOOROO HAS HIDDEN HIM UNTIL TO MORROW MORNING WHEN HE'S TO BE PATCHED TO ME GHIP GHISIZZLE WAS TO HAVE BEEN MY MATE BUT GHIP ESCAPED
8591-284445-0018 BEING CARRIED AWAY BY THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES WHY SHE ASKED ONE OF THEM MEANS TO MARRY HIM EXPLAINED TIGGLE OH THAT'S WORSE THAN BEING PATCHED CRIED TROT MUCH WORSE SAID TIGGLE WITH A GROAN
8591-284445-0019 BUT NOW AN IDEA OCCURRED TO THE GIRL WOULD YOU LIKE TO ESCAPE SHE ASKED THE CAPTIVE I WOULD INDEED SAID HE IF I GET YOU OUT OF THE PALACE CAN YOU HIDE YOURSELF SO THAT YOU WON'T BE FOUND CERTAINLY HE DECLARED
8591-284445-0020 I KNOW A HOUSE WHERE I CAN HIDE SO SNUGLY THAT ALL THE BOOLOOROO'S SOLDIERS CANNOT FIND ME ALL RIGHT SAID TROT I'LL DO IT FOR WHEN YOU'RE GONE THE BOOLOOROO WILL HAVE NO ONE TO PATCH CAP'N BILL TO HE MAY FIND SOME ONE ELSE SUGGESTED THE PRISONER
8591-284445-0021 BUT IT WILL TAKE HIM TIME TO DO THAT AND TIME IS ALL I WANT ANSWERED THE CHILD EVEN WHILE SHE SPOKE TROT WAS BUSY WITH THE KNOTS IN THE CORDS AND PRESENTLY SHE HAD UNBOUND TIGGLE WHO SOON GOT UPON HIS FEET
8591-284445-0022 NOW I'LL GO TO ONE END OF THE PASSAGE AND MAKE A NOISE SAID SHE AND WHEN THE GUARD RUNS TO SEE WHAT IT IS YOU MUST RUN THE OTHER WAY OUTSIDE THE PALACE JIMFRED AND FREDJIM ARE ON GUARD
8591-284445-0023 BUT IF YOU TIP OVER THE BENCH THEY ARE SEATED ON YOU CAN EASILY ESCAPE THEM I'LL DO THAT ALL RIGHT PROMISED THE DELIGHTED TIGGLE YOU'VE MADE A FRIEND OF ME LITTLE GIRL AND IF EVER I CAN HELP YOU I'LL DO IT WITH PLEASURE THEN TROT STARTED FOR THE DOOR
8591-284445-0024 AND TIGGLE COULD NO LONGER SEE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS NOT NOW TOUCHING HIM THE MAN WAS MUCH SURPRISED AT HER DISAPPEARANCE BUT LISTENED CAREFULLY AND WHEN HE HEARD THE GIRL MAKE A NOISE AT ONE END OF THE CORRIDOR HE OPENED THE DOOR AND RAN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AS HE HAD BEEN TOLD TO DO
8591-284445-0025 OF COURSE THE GUARD COULD NOT DISCOVER WHAT MADE THE NOISE AND TROT RAN LITTLE RISK AS SHE WAS CAREFUL NOT TO LET HIM TOUCH HER WHEN TIGGLE HAD SAFELY ESCAPED THE LITTLE GIRL WANDERED THROUGH THE PALACE IN SEARCH OF CAP'N BILL
8591-284445-0026 BUT SOON DECIDED SUCH A QUEST IN THE DARK WAS LIKELY TO FAIL AND SHE MUST WAIT UNTIL MORNING SHE WAS TIRED TOO AND THOUGHT SHE WOULD FIND A VACANT ROOM OF WHICH THERE WERE MANY IN THE BIG PALACE AND GO TO SLEEP UNTIL DAYLIGHT
8591-284445-0027 SHE REMEMBERED THERE WAS A COMFORTABLE VACANT ROOM JUST OPPOSITE THE SUITE OF THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES SO SHE STOLE SOFTLY UP TO IT AND TRIED THE DOOR IT WAS LOCKED BUT THE KEY WAS OUTSIDE
8591-284445-0028 AS THE BLUESKINS SELDOM TOOK A DOOR KEY AWAY FROM ITS PLACE SO SHE TURNED THE KEY OPENED THE DOOR AND WALKED IN NOW THIS WAS THE CHAMBER IN WHICH GHIP GHISIZZLE HAD BEEN CONFINED BY THE PRINCESSES
8591-284445-0029 BUT HIS LEGS LEFT FREE THE BOOLOOROO IN HIS SEARCH HAD FAILED TO DISCOVER WHAT HAD BECOME OF GHIP GHISIZZLE BUT THE POOR MAN HAD BEEN WORRIED EVERY MINUTE FOR FEAR HIS RETREAT WOULD BE DISCOVERED OR THAT THE TERRIBLE PRINCESSES WOULD COME FOR HIM AND NAG HIM UNTIL HE WENT CRAZY
8591-284445-0030 THERE WAS ONE WINDOW IN HIS ROOM AND THE PRISONER HAD MANAGED TO PUSH OPEN THE SASH WITH HIS KNEES LOOKING OUT HE FOUND THAT A FEW FEET BELOW THE WINDOW WAS THE BROAD WALL THAT RAN ALL AROUND THE PALACE GARDENS A LITTLE WAY TO THE RIGHT
8591-284445-0031 THE WALL JOINED THE WALL OF THE CITY BEING ON THE SAME LEVEL WITH IT GHIP GHISIZZLE HAD BEEN THINKING DEEPLY UPON THIS DISCOVERY AND HE DECIDED THAT IF ANYONE ENTERED HIS ROOM HE WOULD GET THROUGH THE WINDOW LEAP DOWN UPON THE WALL AND TRY IN THIS WAY TO ESCAPE
8591-284445-0032 IT WOULD BE A DANGEROUS LEAP FOR AS HIS ARMS WERE BOUND HE MIGHT TOPPLE OFF THE WALL INTO THE GARDEN BUT HE RESOLVED TO TAKE THIS CHANCE THEREFORE WHEN TROT RATTLED AT THE DOOR OF HIS ROOM GHIP GHISIZZLE RAN AND SEATED HIMSELF UPON THE WINDOW SILL
8591-284445-0033 DANGLING HIS LONG LEGS OVER THE EDGE WHEN SHE FINALLY OPENED THE DOOR HE SLIPPED OFF AND LET HIMSELF FALL TO THE WALL WHERE HE DOUBLED UP IN A HEAP THE NEXT MINUTE HOWEVER HE HAD SCRAMBLED TO HIS FEET AND WAS RUNNING SWIFTLY ALONG THE GARDEN WALL
8591-284445-0034 TROT FINDING THE WINDOW OPEN CAME AND LOOKED OUT AND SHE SAW THE MAJORDOMO'S TALL FORM HASTENING ALONG THE TOP OF THE WALL THE GUARDS SAW HIM TOO OUTLINED AGAINST THE SKY IN THE MOONLIGHT AND THEY BEGAN YELLING AT HIM TO STOP
8591-284445-0035 BUT GHIP GHISIZZLE KEPT RIGHT ON UNTIL HE REACHED THE CITY WALL WHEN HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THAT MORE GUARDS WERE YELLING NOW RUNNING ALONG THE FOOT OF THE WALL TO KEEP THE FUGITIVE IN SIGHT AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO POUR OUT OF THE HOUSES AND JOIN IN THE CHASE
8591-284445-0036 POOR GHIP REALIZED THAT IF HE KEPT ON THE WALL HE WOULD MERELY CIRCLE THE CITY AND FINALLY BE CAUGHT IF HE LEAPED DOWN INTO THE CITY HE WOULD BE SEIZED AT ONCE JUST THEN HE CAME OPPOSITE THE CAMP OF THE PINKIES
8591-284445-0037 AND DECIDED TO TRUST HIMSELF TO THE MERCIES OF HIS EARTH FRIENDS RATHER THAN BE MADE A PRISONER BY HIS OWN PEOPLE WHO WOULD OBEY THE COMMANDS OF THEIR DETESTED BUT GREATLY FEARED BOOLOOROO SO SUDDENLY HE GAVE A MIGHTY LEAP
8591-284445-0038 AND CAME DOWN INTO THE FIELD OUTSIDE THE CITY AGAIN HE FELL IN A HEAP AND ROLLED OVER AND OVER FOR IT WAS A HIGH WALL AND THE JUMP A DANGEROUS ONE BUT FINALLY HE RECOVERED AND GOT UPON HIS FEET DELIGHTED TO FIND HE HAD BROKEN NONE OF HIS BONES
8591-284445-0039 SOME OF THE BLUESKINS HAD BY NOW OPENED A GATE AND OUT RUSHED A CROWD TO CAPTURE THE FUGITIVE BUT GHIP GHISIZZLE MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE CAMP OF THE PINKIES AND HIS PURSUERS DID NOT DARE FOLLOW HIM FAR IN THAT DIRECTION THEY SOON GAVE UP THE CHASE AND RETURNED TO THE CITY
