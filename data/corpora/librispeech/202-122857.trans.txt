202-122857-0007 ANNE STOOD AND WATCHED DIANA OUT OF SIGHT
202-122857-0008 AND EVEN IF I HAD IT WOULDN'T BE THE SAME SOMEHOW LITTLE DREAM GIRLS ARE NOT SATISFYING AFTER A REAL FRIEND DIANA AND I HAD SUCH AN AFFECTING FAREWELL DOWN BY THE SPRING IT WILL BE SACRED IN MY MEMORY FOREVER
202-122857-0009 I USED THE MOST PATHETIC LANGUAGE I COULD THINK OF AND SAID THOU AND THEE THOU AND THEE SEEM SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC THAN YOU
202-122857-0010 PLEASE SEE THAT IT IS BURIED WITH ME FOR I DON'T BELIEVE I'LL LIVE VERY LONG PERHAPS WHEN SHE SEES ME LYING COLD AND DEAD BEFORE HER MISSUS BARRY MAY FEEL REMORSE FOR WHAT SHE HAS DONE AND WILL LET DIANA COME TO MY FUNERAL
202-122857-0011 I DON'T THINK THERE IS MUCH FEAR OF YOUR DYING OF GRIEF AS LONG AS YOU CAN TALK ANNE SAID MARILLA UNSYMPATHETICALLY THE FOLLOWING MONDAY ANNE SURPRISED MARILLA BY COMING DOWN FROM HER ROOM WITH HER BASKET OF BOOKS ON HER ARM AND HIP
202-122857-0012 AND HER LIPS PRIMMED UP INTO A LINE OF DETERMINATION I'M GOING BACK TO SCHOOL SHE ANNOUNCED THAT IS ALL THERE IS LEFT IN LIFE FOR ME NOW THAT MY FRIEND HAS BEEN RUTHLESSLY TORN FROM ME IN SCHOOL I CAN LOOK AT HER AND MUSE OVER DAYS DEPARTED
202-122857-0013 I'LL TRY TO BE A MODEL PUPIL AGREED ANNE DOLEFULLY THERE WON'T BE MUCH FUN IN IT I EXPECT MISTER PHILLIPS SAID MINNIE ANDREWS WAS A MODEL PUPIL AND THERE ISN'T A SPARK OF IMAGINATION OR LIFE IN HER
202-122857-0014 SHE IS JUST DULL AND POKY AND NEVER SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD TIME BUT I FEEL SO DEPRESSED THAT PERHAPS IT WILL COME EASY TO ME NOW I'M GOING ROUND BY THE ROAD I COULDN'T BEAR TO GO BY THE BIRCH PATH ALL ALONE I SHOULD WEEP
202-122857-0015 BITTER TEARS IF I DID ANNE WAS WELCOMED BACK TO SCHOOL WITH OPEN ARMS HER IMAGINATION HAD BEEN SORELY MISSED IN GAMES HER VOICE IN THE SINGING AND HER DRAMATIC ABILITY IN THE PERUSAL ALOUD OF BOOKS AT DINNER HOUR
202-122857-0016 SO NICE FOR TRIMMING APRONS KATIE BOULTER
202-122857-0017 AND JULIA BELL COPIED CAREFULLY ON A PIECE OF PALE PINK PAPER SCALLOPED ON THE EDGES THE FOLLOWING EFFUSION WHEN TWILIGHT DROPS HER CURTAIN DOWN AND PINS IT WITH A STAR REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE A FRIEND THOUGH SHE MAY WANDER FAR
202-122857-0018 IT'S SO NICE TO BE APPRECIATED SIGHED ANNE RAPTUROUSLY TO MARILLA THAT NIGHT THE GIRLS WERE NOT THE ONLY SCHOLARS WHO APPRECIATED HER WHEN ANNE WENT TO HER SEAT AFTER DINNER HOUR
202-122857-0019 SHE HAD BEEN TOLD BY MISTER PHILLIPS TO SIT WITH THE MODEL MINNIE ANDREWS SHE FOUND ON HER DESK A BIG LUSCIOUS STRAWBERRY APPLE ANNE CAUGHT IT UP ALL READY TO TAKE A BITE WHEN SHE REMEMBERED THAT THE ONLY PLACE IN AVONLEA WHERE STRAWBERRY APPLES GREW
202-122857-0020 WAS IN THE OLD BLYTHE ORCHARD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE OF SHINING WATERS ANNE DROPPED THE APPLE AS IF IT WERE A RED HOT COAL AND OSTENTATIOUSLY WIPED HER FINGERS ON HER HANDKERCHIEF
202-122857-0021 BEDIZENED WITH STRIPED RED AND YELLOW PAPER COSTING TWO CENTS WHERE ORDINARY PENCILS COST ONLY ONE WHICH HE SENT UP TO HER AFTER DINNER HOUR MET WITH A MORE FAVORABLE RECEPTION ANNE WAS GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO ACCEPT IT
202-122857-0022 AND REWARDED THE DONOR WITH A SMILE WHICH EXALTED THAT INFATUATED YOUTH STRAIGHTWAY INTO THE SEVENTH HEAVEN OF DELIGHT AND CAUSED HIM TO MAKE SUCH FEARFUL ERRORS IN HIS DICTATION THAT MISTER PHILLIPS KEPT HIM IN AFTER SCHOOL TO REWRITE IT
202-122857-0023 BUT AS THE CAESAR'S PAGEANT SHORN OF BRUTUS BUST DID BUT OF ROME'S BEST SON REMIND HER MORE SO THE MARKED ABSENCE OF ANY TRIBUTE OR RECOGNITION FROM DIANA BARRY WHO WAS SITTING WITH GERTIE PYE EMBITTERED
202-122857-0024 ANNE'S LITTLE TRIUMPH DIANA MIGHT JUST HAVE SMILED AT ME ONCE I THINK SHE MOURNED TO MARILLA THAT NIGHT BUT THE NEXT MORNING A NOTE MOST FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY TWISTED AND FOLDED
202-122857-0025 AND A SMALL PARCEL WERE PASSED ACROSS TO ANNE DEAR ANNE RAN THE FORMER MOTHER SAYS I'M NOT TO PLAY WITH YOU OR TALK TO YOU EVEN IN SCHOOL IT ISN'T MY FAULT AND DON'T BE CROSS AT ME BECAUSE I LOVE YOU AS MUCH AS EVER
202-122857-0026 THEY ARE AWFULLY FASHIONABLE NOW AND ONLY THREE GIRLS IN SCHOOL KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEM WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT REMEMBER YOUR TRUE FRIEND DIANA BARRY ANNE READ THE NOTE
202-122857-0027 KISSED THE BOOKMARK AND DISPATCHED A PROMPT REPLY BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCHOOL MY OWN DARLING DIANA OF COURSE I AM NOT CROSS AT YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO OBEY YOUR MOTHER OUR SPIRITS CAN COMMUNE
202-122857-0028 I SHALL KEEP YOUR LOVELY PRESENT FOREVER MINNIE ANDREWS IS A VERY NICE LITTLE GIRL ALTHOUGH SHE HAS NO IMAGINATION BUT AFTER HAVING BEEN DIANA'S BUSUM FRIEND I CANNOT BE MINNIE'S
202-122857-0029 ALTHOUGH MUCH IMPROOVED YOURS UNTIL DEATH US DO PART ANNE OR CORDELIA SHIRLEY P S I SHALL SLEEP WITH YOUR LETTER UNDER MY PILLOW TONIGHT A OR C S
202-122857-0030 MARILLA PESSIMISTICALLY EXPECTED MORE TROUBLE SINCE ANNE HAD AGAIN BEGUN TO GO TO SCHOOL BUT NONE DEVELOPED PERHAPS ANNE CAUGHT SOMETHING OF THE MODEL SPIRIT FROM MINNIE ANDREWS
202-122857-0031 AT LEAST SHE GOT ON VERY WELL WITH MISTER PHILLIPS THENCEFORTH SHE FLUNG HERSELF INTO HER STUDIES HEART AND SOUL DETERMINED NOT TO BE OUTDONE IN ANY CLASS BY GILBERT BLYTHE THE RIVALRY BETWEEN THEM WAS SOON APPARENT
202-122857-0032 IT WAS ENTIRELY GOOD NATURED ON GILBERT'S SIDE BUT IT IS MUCH TO BE FEARED THAT THE SAME THING CANNOT BE SAID OF ANNE WHO HAD CERTAINLY AN UNPRAISEWORTHY TENACITY FOR HOLDING GRUDGES SHE WAS AS INTENSE IN HER HATREDS AS IN HER LOVES
202-122857-0033 SHE WOULD NOT STOOP TO ADMIT THAT SHE MEANT TO RIVAL GILBERT IN SCHOOLWORK BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS EXISTENCE WHICH ANNE PERSISTENTLY IGNORED BUT THE RIVALRY WAS THERE AND HONORS FLUCTUATED BETWEEN THEM
202-122857-0034 NOW GILBERT WAS HEAD OF THE SPELLING CLASS NOW ANNE WITH A TOSS OF HER LONG RED BRAIDS SPELLED HIM DOWN ONE MORNING GILBERT HAD ALL HIS SUMS DONE CORRECTLY AND HAD HIS NAME WRITTEN ON THE BLACKBOARD ON THE ROLL OF HONOR
202-122857-0035 THE NEXT MORNING ANNE HAVING WRESTLED WILDLY WITH DECIMALS THE ENTIRE EVENING BEFORE WOULD BE FIRST ONE AWFUL DAY THEY WERE TIES AND THEIR NAMES WERE WRITTEN UP TOGETHER IT WAS ALMOST AS BAD AS A TAKE NOTICE
202-122857-0036 AND ANNE'S MORTIFICATION WAS AS EVIDENT AS GILBERT'S SATISFACTION WHEN THE WRITTEN EXAMINATIONS AT THE END OF EACH MONTH WERE HELD THE SUSPENSE WAS TERRIBLE THE FIRST MONTH GILBERT CAME OUT THREE MARKS AHEAD THE SECOND
202-122857-0037 ANNE BEAT HIM BY FIVE BUT HER TRIUMPH WAS MARRED BY THE FACT THAT GILBERT CONGRATULATED HER HEARTILY BEFORE THE WHOLE SCHOOL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO MUCH SWEETER TO HER IF HE HAD FELT THE STING OF HIS DEFEAT
202-122857-0038 MISTER PHILLIPS MIGHT NOT BE A VERY GOOD TEACHER BUT A PUPIL SO INFLEXIBLY DETERMINED ON LEARNING AS ANNE WAS COULD HARDLY ESCAPE MAKING PROGRESS UNDER ANY KIND OF TEACHER
202-122857-0039 ANNE AND GILBERT WERE BOTH PROMOTED INTO THE FIFTH CLASS AND ALLOWED TO BEGIN STUDYING THE ELEMENTS OF THE BRANCHES BY WHICH LATIN GEOMETRY FRENCH AND ALGEBRA WERE MEANT IN GEOMETRY ANNE MET HER WATERLOO
202-122857-0040 IT'S PERFECTLY AWFUL STUFF MARILLA SHE GROANED I'M SURE I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF IT THERE IS NO SCOPE FOR IMAGINATION IN IT AT ALL MISTER PHILLIPS SAYS I'M THE WORST DUNCE HE EVER SAW AT IT
202-122857-0041 EVEN DIANA GETS ALONG BETTER THAN I DO BUT I DON'T MIND BEING BEATEN BY DIANA
