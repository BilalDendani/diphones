1566-153036-0000 CHAPTER TEN THE QUEEN OF NAVARRE THE SUN HAD JUST RISEN WHEN MAITRE BERTRAM ACCOMPANIED BY FOUR MEN IN THE ATTIRE OF PEASANTS WENT DOWN TO THE PORT
1566-153036-0001 TWO OF THEM WORE STEEL CAPS AND HAD THE APPEARANCE OF DISCHARGED SOLDIERS THE OTHER TWO LOOKED LIKE FRESH COUNTRYMEN AND WORE THE LOW CAPS IN USE BY THE PEASANTRY ON THEIR HEADS CARRYING STEEL CAPS SLUNG BY CORDS FROM THEIR SHOULDER
1566-153036-0002 AND FIND THAT THEY ARE TOO FAST FOR YOU PUT THEM ASHORE WHEREVER THEY MAY DIRECT IF YOU ARE TOO HOTLY CHASED TO ESCAPE AFTER LANDING THEM YOU HAD BEST ALSO DISEMBARK AND MAKE YOUR WAY BACK BY LAND AS BEST YOU CAN LEAVING THEM TO DO WHAT THEY WILL WITH THE BOAT AS LIKE AS NOT THEY WOULD CUT YOUR THROATS DID THEY TAKE YOU
1566-153036-0003 AND IF NOT WOULD WANT TO KNOW WHOM YOU HAD LANDED AND OTHER MATTERS I DO NOT WANT TO LOSE THE CRAFT WHICH HAS DONE ME GOOD SERVICE IN HER TIME AND IS A HANDY LITTLE COASTER BUT I WOULD RATHER LOSE IT THAN THAT YOU SHOULD FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE BORDEAUX BOATS AND GET INTO TROUBLE
1566-153036-0004 THE FACT THAT YOU MADE FOR SHORE TO LAND PASSENGERS WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO SHOW THAT THOSE PASSENGERS WERE OF SOME IMPORTANCE NOW GOOD LUCK TO YOU MASTER PHILIP I TRUST TO SEE YOU BACK HERE AGAIN BEFORE LONG THEY KEPT STRAIGHT OUT FROM LA ROCHELLE TO THE ISLE OF OLERON
1566-153036-0005 LEST BOATS COMING OUT FROM THE CHARENTE MIGHT OVERHAUL THEM FROM THE SOUTHERN END OF THE ISLAND IT WAS ONLY A RUN OF SOME EIGHT MILES INTO THE MOUTH OF THE SEUDRE A BRISK WIND HAD BLOWN AND THEY MADE THE FORTY MILES VOYAGE IN SEVEN HOURS THEY COULD SEE SEVERAL WHITE SAILS FAR TO THE SOUTH AS THEY RAN IN
1566-153036-0006 THEY WERE ROWED ASHORE IN THE LITTLE BOAT THE CRAFT CARRIED
1566-153036-0007 SO AS TO AVOID ANY QUESTIONINGS FROM PERSONS THEY MIGHT MEET AS TO WHERE THEY HAD COME FROM
1566-153036-0008 AND TWO OR THREE FLASKS OF GOOD WINE
1566-153036-0009 THEY DID NOT APPROACH THE TOWN BUT KEEPING BEHIND IT CAME DOWN UPON THE ROAD RUNNING ALONG THE SHORE THREE MILES BEYOND IT AND WALKED ALONG IT UNTIL ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK BY WHICH TIME ALL WERE THOROUGHLY TIRED WITH THEIR UNACCUSTOMED EXERCISE LEAVING THE ROAD THEY FOUND A SHELTERED SPOT AMONG THE SAND HILLS
1566-153036-0010 ATE A HEARTY MEAL AND THEN LAY DOWN TO SLEEP THEY WERE AFOOT AGAIN AT DAYLIGHT THE COUNTRY WAS SPARSELY POPULATED THEY PASSED THROUGH A FEW SMALL VILLAGES BUT NO PLACE OF ANY IMPORTANCE UNTIL LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THEY APPROACHED BLAYE AFTER A LONG DAY'S TRAMP
1566-153036-0011 THEY PASSED THROUGH THE GATES HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THEY WERE CLOSED AND ENTERED A SMALL CABARET HERE CALLING FOR SOME BREAD AND COMMON WINE THEY SAT DOWN IN A CORNER AND LISTENED TO THE TALK OF THE MEN WHO WERE DRINKING THERE IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE MOVEMENTS OF TROOPS AND THE SCRAPS OF NEWS THAT HAD COME IN FROM ALL QUARTERS
1566-153036-0012 THE QUEEN OF NAVARRE HAS NO TROOPS
1566-153036-0013 THEY SAY THEY HADN'T FIFTY MEN WITH THEM IT SEEMS TO ME THEY ARE MAKING A GREAT FUSS ABOUT NOTHING I HAVE JUST HEARD A REPORT A MAN WHO HAD TWO OR THREE MINUTES BEFORE ENTERED THE ROOM SAID TO THE EFFECT THAT THEY ARRIVED FOUR DAYS SINCE AT LA ROCHELLE
1566-153036-0014 WITH SOME FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED MEN WHO JOINED THEM ON THE WAY AN EXCLAMATION OF SURPRISE BROKE FROM HIS HEARERS THEN WE SHALL HAVE TROUBLE ONE EXCLAIMED LA ROCHELLE IS A HARD NUT TO CRACK IN ITSELF
1566-153036-0015 AND MAY GIVE A GOOD DEAL OF TROUBLE AFTER ALL WHAT CAN THE CATHOLIC LORDS HAVE BEEN ABOUT THAT THEY MANAGED TO LET THEM SLIP THROUGH THEIR HANDS IN THAT WAY THEY MUST HAVE SEEN FOR SOME TIME THAT THEY WERE MAKING FOR THE ONE PLACE WHERE THEY WOULD BE SAFE UNLESS INDEED THEY WERE MAKING DOWN FOR NAVARRE
1566-153036-0016 I EXPECT THEY ARE WATCHING BOTH WAYS ANOTHER SAID
1566-153036-0017 AND IF SO THEY WILL BE MOVING IN ALL DIRECTIONS TO JOIN HIM THERE
1566-153036-0018 THAT WILL BE AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER WAY AND SAVE MUCH TROUBLE IT IS A LONG CHASE TO CATCH A PACK OF WOLVES SCATTERED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BUT ONE CAN MAKE SHORT WORK OF THEM ALL WHEN YOU GET THEM PENNED UP IN AN INCLOSURE
1566-153036-0019 FOR HE FELT SO INCLINED TO RETORT HIMSELF THAT HE FEARED THEY MIGHT GIVE WAY TO A SIMILAR IMPULSE
1566-153036-0020 WERE MUNCHING THEIR BREAD STOLIDLY
1566-153036-0021 IT MUST BE OWNED ANOTHER OF THE GROUP SAID THAT THESE WOLVES BITE HARD
1566-153036-0022 WELL WE LAUGHED WHEN WE SAW THE THREE PARTIES OF WHITE WOLVES RIDE OUT FROM SAINT DENIS BUT I TELL YOU THERE WAS NO LAUGHING WHEN THEY GOT AMONG US WE WERE IN THE CONSTABLE'S TROOP AND THOUGH AS FAR AS I KNOW WE WERE ALL PRETTY STOUT MEN AT ARMS AND WERE FOUR TO ONE AGAINST THEM AT LEAST
1566-153036-0023 WE HAD LITTLE TO BOAST OF WHEN THE FIGHT WAS OVER AT ANY RATE I GOT A MARK OF THE WOLVES TEETH WHICH HAS PUT A STOP TO MY HUNTING AS YOU SEE AND HE HELD OUT HIS ARM I LEFT MY RIGHT HAND ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE IT WAS IN THE FIGHT ROUND CONDE A
1566-153036-0024 SO THERE IS NO MORE WOLF HUNTING FOR ME BUT EVEN IF I HAD MY RIGHT HAND BACK AGAIN I SHOULD NOT CARE FOR ANY MORE SUCH ROUGH SPORT AS THAT PHILIP CONGRATULATED HIMSELF THAT HE WAS SITTING WITH HIS BACK TO THE SPEAKER FOR HE REMEMBERED THE INCIDENT WELL
1566-153036-0025 AND IT WAS HIS ARM THAT HAD STRUCK THE BLOW HIS VISOR HAD BEEN UP BUT AS HIS FACE WAS SHADED BY THE HELMET AND CHEEK PIECES
1566-153036-0026 AH WELL WE SHALL DO BETTER THIS TIME THE FIRST SPEAKER SAID WE ARE BETTER PREPARED THAN WE WERE THEN AND EXCEPT LA ROCHELLE AND FOUR OR FIVE SMALL TOWNS EVERY PLACE IN FRANCE IS IN OUR HANDS
1566-153036-0027 THEN WHEN THAT PESTILENT QUEEN OF NAVARRE AND HER BOY ARE IN OUR HANDS THE WHOLE THING WILL BE OVER AND THE LAST EDICT WILL BE CARRIED OUT AND EACH HUGUENOT WILL HAVE THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE MASS AND THE GALLOWS WELL I WILL HAVE ONE MORE STOUP OF WINE
1566-153036-0028 FOR WE MARCH AT DAYBREAK HOW MANY RIDE OUT WITH YOU THE MAN WHO HAD LOST HIS HAND ASKED A HUNDRED THE TOWN HAS VOTED THE FUNDS AND WE MARCH TO JOIN D'ESCARS TOMORROW I BELIEVE WE ARE NOT GOING TO PERIGUEUX
1566-153036-0029 THE FREQUENTERS OF THE CABARET PRESENTLY DROPPED OFF
1566-153036-0030 WHO ACTED AS SPOKESMAN HAD ON ENTERING ASKED THE LANDLORD IF THEY COULD SLEEP THERE
1566-153036-0031 AS HIS DUTIES WERE NOW OVER HE CAME ACROSS TO THEM WHICH WAY ARE YOU GOING LADS HE ASKED
1566-153036-0032 WE COME FROM NEAR THERE I THOUGHT YOUR TONGUE HAD A SMACK OF GASCON IN IT
1566-153036-0033 FOR MY COMRADE HERE AND I SERVED UNDER DE BRISSAC IN ITALY WE WOULD RATHER ENLIST UNDER OUR OWN LORD THAN UNDER A STRANGER YES THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND THE LANDLORD SAID
1566-153036-0034 WHEN EVERY BRIDGE AND FORD ACROSS THE RIVERS IS WATCHED BY ARMED MEN AND ALL WHO PASS ARE QUESTIONED SHARPLY AS TO THEIR BUSINESS WELL IF THEY WON'T LET US PASS
1566-153036-0035 WE MUST JOIN SOME LEADER HERE
1566-153036-0036 YOUR BEST PLAN WOULD HAVE BEEN TO HAVE GONE BY BOAT TO BORDEAUX
1566-153036-0037 THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT THAT THERE IS NOT A DAY PASSES NOW THAT THE WIND IS FAIR THAT THREE OR FOUR BOATS DO NOT GO OFF TO BORDEAUX WITH PRODUCE FROM THE FARMS AND VINEYARDS OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T GET UP WITHOUT PAYING
1566-153036-0038 WHO IS STARTING IN THE MORNING AND HAS CHARTERED A BOAT TO CARRY HIS PRODUCE IF I SAY A WORD TO HIM I HAVE NO DOUBT HE WOULD GIVE THE FOUR OF YOU A PASSAGE FOR A CROWN
1566-153036-0039 IT WOULD SAVE US SOME THIRTY OR FORTY MILES WALKING AND PERHAPS SOME EXPENSE FOR FERRYS TO SAY NOUGHT OF TROUBLE WITH THE TROOPS WHO ARE APT ENOUGH MOREOVER TO SEARCH THE POCKETS OF THOSE WHO PASS I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD PLAN HIS BROTHER REPLIED
1566-153036-0040 AND THE OTHER TWO ALSO ASSENTED VERY WELL THEN THE LANDLORD SAID MY COUSIN WILL BE HERE IN THE MORNING FOR HE IS GOING TO LEAVE TWO OR THREE BARRELS OF LAST YEAR'S VINTAGE WITH ME
1566-153036-0041 AND AID HIM WITH HIS OTHER GOODS IT WILL SAVE HIM FROM HAVING TO EMPLOY MEN THERE
1566-153036-0042 I WILL MAKE YOU UP A BASKET FOR YOUR JOURNEY SHALL I SAY A BOTTLE OF WINE EACH AND SOME BREAD
1566-153036-0043 AND WE THANK YOU FOR HAVING PUT US IN THE WAY OF SAVING OUR LEGS TOMORROW WHAT TIME DO YOU THINK YOUR COUSIN WILL BE IN HE WILL HAVE HIS CARTS AT THE GATES BY THE TIME THEY OPEN THEM HE IS NOT ONE TO WASTE TIME BESIDES EVERY MINUTE IS OF IMPORTANCE
1566-153036-0044 FOR WITH THIS WIND HE MAY WELL HOPE TO ARRIVE AT BORDEAUX IN TIME TO GET HIS CARGO DISCHARGED BY NIGHTFALL THAT WAS A LUCKY STROKE INDEED
1566-153036-0045 HAVING HUNG UP A LANTERN HAD LEFT THEM ALONE HALF OUR DIFFICULTIES WILL BE OVER WHEN WE GET TO BORDEAUX
