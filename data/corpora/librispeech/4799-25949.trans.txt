4799-25949-0000 THIS IS THE INSIDE STORY OF THE SURRENDER DURING THE SPANISH WAR OF THE TOWN OF COAMO IT IS WRITTEN BY THE MAN TO WHOM THE TOWN SURRENDERED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SURRENDER THIS SAME MAN BECAME MILITARY GOVERNOR OF COAMO
4799-25949-0001 HE HELD OFFICE FOR FULLY TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE BEGINNING THIS STORY THE READER MUST FORGET ALL HE MAY HAPPEN TO KNOW OF THIS PARTICULAR TRIUMPH OF THE PORTO RICAN EXPEDITION
4799-25949-0002 HE MUST FORGET THAT THE TAKING OF COAMO HAS ALWAYS BEEN CREDITED TO MAJOR GENERAL JAMES H WILSON WHO ON THAT OCCASION COMMANDED CAPTAIN ANDERSON'S BATTERY THE SIXTEENTH PENNSYLVANIA TROOP C OF BROOKLYN
4799-25949-0003 AND UNDER GENERAL ERNST THE SECOND AND THIRD WISCONSIN VOLUNTEERS HE MUST FORGET THAT IN THE RECORDS OF THE WAR DEPARTMENT ALL THE PRAISE AND IT IS OF THE HIGHEST FOR THIS VICTORY IS BESTOWED UPON GENERAL WILSON AND HIS FOUR THOUSAND SOLDIERS
4799-25949-0004 EVEN THE WRITER OF THIS WHEN HE CABLED AN ACCOUNT OF THE EVENT TO HIS PAPER GAVE WITH EVERY ONE ELSE THE ENTIRE CREDIT TO GENERAL WILSON AND EVER SINCE HIS CONSCIENCE HAS UPBRAIDED HIM HIS ONLY CLAIM FOR TOLERANCE AS A WAR CORRESPONDENT
4799-25949-0005 HAS BEEN THAT HE ALWAYS HAS STUCK TO THE FACTS AND NOW HE FEELS THAT IN THE SACRED CAUSE OF HISTORY HIS FRIENDSHIP AND ADMIRATION FOR GENERAL WILSON THAT VETERAN OF THE CIVIL PHILIPPINE AND CHINESE WARS
4799-25949-0006 IN ORDER TO GET THERE THEY HAD SPENT THE NIGHT IN CRAWLING OVER MOUNTAIN TRAILS AND SCRAMBLING THROUGH STREAMS AND RAVINES IT WAS GENERAL WILSON'S PLAN THAT BY THIS FLANKING NIGHT MARCH THE SIXTEENTH PENNSYLVANIA WOULD REACH THE ROAD LEADING FROM COAMO TO SAN JUAN
4799-25949-0007 IN TIME TO CUT OFF THE RETREAT OF THE SPANISH GARRISON WHEN GENERAL WILSON WITH THE MAIN BODY ATTACKED IT FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE AT SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING GENERAL WILSON BEGAN THE FRONTAL ATTACK BY TURNING LOOSE THE ARTILLERY ON A BLOCK HOUSE WHICH THREATENED HIS APPROACH
4799-25949-0008 AND BY ADVANCING THE WISCONSIN VOLUNTEERS THE CAVALRY HE SENT TO THE RIGHT TO CAPTURE LOS BANOS AT EIGHT O'CLOCK FROM WHERE THE MAIN BODY RESTED TWO MILES FROM COAMO WE COULD HEAR THE SIXTEENTH PENNSYLVANIA OPEN ITS ATTACK
4799-25949-0009 AND INSTANTLY BECOME HOTLY ENGAGED THE ENEMY RETURNED THE FIRE FIERCELY
4799-25949-0010 EITHER WOULD TAKE THE TOWN WITHOUT THE MAIN BODY OR THAT THEY WOULD GREATLY NEED ITS ASSISTANCE THE ARTILLERY WAS ACCORDINGLY ADVANCED ONE THOUSAND YARDS AND THE INFANTRY WAS HURRIED FORWARD THE SECOND WISCONSIN APPROACHED COAMO ALONG THE MAIN ROAD FROM PONCE
4799-25949-0011 THE THIRD WISCONSIN THROUGH FIELDS OF GRASS TO THE RIGHT OF THE ROAD
4799-25949-0012 BUT BEFORE THEY MET FROM A POSITION NEAR THE ARTILLERY I HAD WATCHED THROUGH MY GLASSES THE SECOND WISCONSIN WITH GENERAL ERNST AT ITS HEAD ADVANCING ALONG THE MAIN ROAD AND AS WHEN I SAW THEM THEY WERE NEAR THE RIVER
4799-25949-0013 AS THE FIRING FROM THE SIXTEENTH STILL CONTINUED IT SEEMED OBVIOUS THAT GENERAL ERNST WOULD BE THE FIRST GENERAL OFFICER TO ENTER COAMO
4799-25949-0014 I HAD NEVER SEEN FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE SURRENDER TO ONE MAN
4799-25949-0015 MY BEST PLAN WAS TO ABANDON THE ARTILLERY AND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE PURSUE THE SECOND WISCONSIN I DID NOT WANT TO SHARE THE SPECTACLE OF THE SURRENDER WITH MY BROTHER CORRESPONDENTS SO I TRIED TO STEAL AWAY FROM THE THREE WHO WERE PRESENT THEY WERE THOMAS F MILLARD
4799-25949-0016 WALSTEIN ROOT OF THE SUN AND HORACE THOMPSON BY DODGING THROUGH A COFFEE CENTRAL I CAME OUT A HALF MILE FROM THEM AND IN ADVANCE OF THE THIRD WISCONSIN THERE I ENCOUNTERED TWO BOY OFFICERS
4799-25949-0017 CAPTAIN JOHN C BRECKENRIDGE AND LIEUTENANT FRED S TITUS WHO HAD TEMPORARILY ABANDONED THEIR THANKLESS DUTIES IN THE COMMISSARIAT DEPARTMENT IN ORDER TO SEEK DEATH OR GLORY IN THE SKIRMISH LINE THEY WANTED TO KNOW WHERE I WAS GOING AND WHEN I EXPLAINED
4799-25949-0018 BUT FROM THE BALD RIDGE WHERE THE ARTILLERY WAS STILL HAMMERING THE TOWN THE THREE CORRESPONDENTS AND CAPTAIN ALFRED PAGET HER MAJESTY'S NAVAL ATTACHE OBSERVED OUR ATTEMPT TO STEAL A MARCH ON GENERAL WILSON'S FORCES AND PURSUED US AND SOON OVERTOOK US
4799-25949-0019 OR TO BE EXACT EIGHT FOR WITH MISTER MILLARD WAS JIMMY WHO IN TIMES OF PEACE SELLS PAPERS IN HERALD SQUARE
4799-25949-0020 AND STARTED ON A GALLOP ALONG THE MILE OF MILITARY ROAD THAT LAY BETWEEN US AND COAMO THE FIRING FROM THE SIXTEENTH PENNSYLVANIA HAD SLACKENED BUT AS WE ADVANCED IT BECAME SHARPER MORE INSISTENT AND SEEMED TO URGE US TO GREATER SPEED
4799-25949-0021 ACROSS THE ROAD WERE DUG ROUGH RIFLE PITS WHICH HAD THE LOOK OF HAVING BEEN BUT THAT MOMENT ABANDONED
4799-25949-0022 WAS BURNING IN POTS OVER TINY FIRES LITTLE HEAPS OF CARTRIDGES LAY IN READINESS UPON THE EDGES OF EACH PIT AND AN ARM CHAIR
4799-25949-0023 THE ONLY LIVING THINGS WE SAW WERE THE CHICKENS AND PIGS IN THE KITCHEN GARDENS ON EITHER HAND WAS EVERY EVIDENCE OF HASTY AND PANIC STRICKEN FLIGHT WE REJOICED AT THESE EVIDENCES OF THE FACT THAT THE WISCONSIN VOLUNTEERS HAD SWEPT ALL BEFORE THEM
4799-25949-0024 OUR REJOICINGS WERE NOT ENTIRELY UNSELFISH IT WAS SO QUIET AHEAD THAT SOME ONE SUGGESTED THE TOWN HAD ALREADY SURRENDERED
4799-25949-0025 WE REFUSED TO BELIEVE IT AND WHIPPED THE PONIES INTO GREATER HASTE WE WERE NOW ONLY A QUARTER OF A MILE DISTANT FROM THE BUILT UP PORTION OF COAMO WHERE THE ROAD TURNED SHARPLY INTO THE MAIN STREET OF THE TOWN CAPTAIN PAGET
4799-25949-0026 WHO IN THE ABSENCE OF THE BRITISH MILITARY ATTACHE ON ACCOUNT OF SICKNESS ACCOMPANIED THE ARMY AS A GUEST OF GENERAL WILSON GAVE WAY TO THOUGHTS OF ETIQUETTE
4799-25949-0027 THE WORDS WERE JOLTED OUT OF HIM AS HE ROSE IN THE SADDLE THE NOISE OF THE PONIES HOOFS MADE CONVERSATION DIFFICULT I SHOUTED BACK THAT THE PRESENCE OF GENERAL ERNST IN THE TOWN MADE IT QUITE PROPER FOR A FOREIGN ATTACHE TO ENTER IT IT MUST HAVE SURRENDERED BY NOW I SHOUTED
4799-25949-0028 IT'S BEEN HALF AN HOUR SINCE ERNST CROSSED THE BRIDGE AT THESE INNOCENT WORDS ALL MY COMPANIONS TUGGED VIOLENTLY AT THEIR BRIDLES AND SHOUTED WHOA CROSSED THE BRIDGE THEY YELLED THERE IS NO BRIDGE THE BRIDGE IS BLOWN UP IF HE HASN'T CROSSED BY THE FORD
4799-25949-0029 HE ISN'T IN THE TOWN THEN IN MY TURN I SHOUTED WHOA BUT BY NOW THE PORTO RICAN PONIES HAD DECIDED THAT THIS WAS THE RACE OF THEIR LIVES AND EACH HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT MEXICAN BIT OR NO MEXICAN BIT UNTIL HE HAD CARRIED HIS RIDER FIRST INTO THE TOWN OF COAMO
4799-25949-0030 HE WOULD NOT BE HALTED AS I TUGGED HELPLESSLY AT MY MEXICAN BIT I SAW HOW I HAD MADE MY MISTAKE THE VOLUNTEERS ON FINDING THE BRIDGE DESTROYED INSTEAD OF MARCHING UPON COAMO HAD TURNED TO THE FORD THE SAME FORD WHICH WE HAD CROSSED
4799-25949-0031 WE SEVEN UNARMED MEN AND JIMMY
4799-25949-0032 I SHOUTED BACK THAT NO ONE REGRETTED THE FACT THAT HE WAS NOT MORE KEENLY THAN I DID MYSELF TITUS AND BRECKENRIDGE EACH GLANCED AT A NEW FULL DRESS SWORD WE MIGHT AS WELL GO IN THEY SHOUTED AND TAKE IT ANYWAY
4799-25949-0033 I DECIDED THAT TITUS AND BRECKENRIDGE WERE WASTED IN THE COMMISSARIAT DEPARTMENT THE THREE CORRESPONDENTS LOOKED MORE COMFORTABLE
4799-25949-0034 WAIT SHOUTED HER MAJESTY'S REPRESENTATIVE
4799-25949-0035 BUT PAGET'S PONY REFUSED TO CONSIDER THE FEELINGS OF THE LORDS OF THE ADMIRALTY AS SUCCESSFULLY PAGET MIGHT HAVE TRIED TO PULL BACK A ROW BOAT FROM THE EDGE OF NIAGARA AND MOREOVER MILLARD IN ORDER THAT JIMMY MIGHT BE THE FIRST TO REACH PONCE WITH DESPATCHES
4799-25949-0036 HAD MOUNTED HIM ON THE FASTEST PONY IN THE BUNCH AND HE ALREADY WAS FAR IN THE LEAD HIS SPORTING INSTINCTS NURSED IN THE POOL ROOMS OF THE TENDERLOIN AND AT GUTTENBURG HAD SENT HIM THREE LENGTHS TO THE GOOD IT NEVER WOULD DO TO HAVE A NEWSBOY TELL IN NEW YORK
4799-25949-0037 THAT HE HAD BEATEN THE CORRESPONDENTS OF THE PAPERS HE SOLD IN THE STREETS NOR TO PERMIT COMMISSIONED OFFICERS TO TAKE THE DUST OF ONE WHO NEVER BEFORE HAD RIDDEN ON ANYTHING BUT A CABLE CAR SO WE ALL RACED FORWARD AND BUNCHED TOGETHER SWEPT INTO THE MAIN STREET OF COAMO
4799-25949-0038 IT WAS GRATEFULLY EMPTY THERE WERE NO AMERICAN SOLDIERS BUT THEN NEITHER WERE THERE ANY SPANISH SOLDIERS ACROSS THE STREET STRETCHED MORE RIFLE PITS AND BARRICADES OF IRON PIPES BUT IN SIGHT THERE WAS NEITHER FRIEND NOR FOE
4799-25949-0039 ON THE STONES OF THE DESERTED STREET THE GALLOPING HOOFS SOUNDED LIKE THE ADVANCE OF A WHOLE REGIMENT OF CAVALRY THEIR CLATTER GAVE US A MOST COMFORTABLE FEELING WE ALMOST COULD IMAGINE THE TOWNSPEOPLE BELIEVING US TO BE THE ROUGH RIDERS THEMSELVES AND FLEEING BEFORE US
4799-25949-0040 AND THEN THE EMPTY STREET SEEMED TO THREATEN AN AMBUSH WE THOUGHT HASTILY OF SUNKEN MINES OF SOLDIERS CROUCHING BEHIND THE BARRIERS BEHIND THE HOUSES AT THE NEXT CORNER OF MAUSERS COVERING US FROM THE LATTICED BALCONIES OVERHEAD
4799-25949-0041 A LONELY MAN DASHED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET HURLED A WHITE FLAG IN FRONT OF US AND THEN DIVED HEADLONG UNDER THE PORCH OF A HOUSE THE NEXT INSTANT AS THOUGH AT A SIGNAL A HUNDRED CITIZENS EACH WITH A WHITE FLAG IN BOTH HANDS RAN FROM COVER
4799-25949-0042 WAVING THEIR BANNERS AND GASPING IN WEAK AND TERROR SHAKEN TONES VIVAN LOS AMERICANOS WE TRIED TO PULL UP BUT THE PONIES HAD NOT YET SETTLED AMONG THEMSELVES WHICH OF US HAD WON AND CARRIED US TO THE EXTREME EDGE OF THE TOWN
4799-25949-0043 WHERE A PRECIPICE SEEMED TO INVITE THEM TO STOP AND WE FELL OFF INTO THE ARMS OF THE PORTO RICANS
4799-25949-0044 AND DEMIJOHNS OF NATIVE RUM THEY WERE ABJECT TREMBLING TEARFUL THEY MADE ONE INSTANTLY FORGET THAT THE MOMENT BEFORE HE HAD BEEN EXTREMELY FRIGHTENED ONE OF THEM SPOKE TO ME THE FEW WORDS OF SPANISH WITH WHICH I HAD AN ACQUAINTANCE
4799-25949-0045 HE TOLD ME HE WAS THE ALCALDE AND THAT HE BEGGED TO SURRENDER INTO MY HANDS THE TOWN OF COAMO I LED HIM INSTANTLY TO ONE SIDE I WAS AFRAID THAT IF I DID NOT TAKE HIM UP HE WOULD SURRENDER TO PAGET OR TO JIMMY I BADE HIM CONDUCT ME TO HIS OFFICIAL RESIDENCE
4799-25949-0046 HE DID SO AND GAVE ME THE KEY TO THE CARTEL A STAFF OF OFFICE OF GOLD AND EBONY AND THE FLAG OF THE TOWN
4799-25949-0047 I DECIDED THAT WITH WHATEVER ELSE I MIGHT PART THAT FLAG WOULD ALWAYS BE MINE THAT THE CHANCE OF MY AGAIN RECEIVING THE SURRENDER OF A TOWN OF FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WAS SLENDER AND THAT THIS TOKEN WOULD BE WRAPPED AROUND ME IN MY COFFIN
4799-25949-0048 I ACCORDINGLY HID IT IN MY PONCHO AND STRAPPED IT TO MY SADDLE THEN I APPOINTED A HOTEL KEEPER WHO SPOKE A LITTLE ENGLISH AS MY OFFICIAL INTERPRETER AND TOLD THE ALCALDE THAT I WAS NOW MILITARY GOVERNOR MAYOR AND CHIEF OF POLICE
4799-25949-0049 HE GAVE ME A RUBBER STAMP WITH A COAT OF ARMS CUT IN IT AND I WROTE MYSELF THREE LETTERS WHICH TO INSURE THEIR SAFE ARRIVAL I ADDRESSED TO THREE DIFFERENT PLACES AND STAMPED THEM WITH THE RUBBER SEALS IN TIME ALL THREE REACHED ME
4799-25949-0050 OF COAMO DURING THAT BRIEF ADMINISTRATION I DETAILED TITUS AND BRECKENRIDGE TO WIGWAG THE SIXTEENTH PENNSYLVANIA THAT WE HAD TAKEN THE TOWN
4799-25949-0051 IN ORDER TO COMPROMISE PAGET THEY USED HIS RED SILK HANDKERCHIEF ROOT I DETAILED TO CONCILIATE THE INHABITANTS BY DRINKING WITH EVERY ONE OF THEM HE TELLS ME HE CARRIED OUT MY INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER I ALSO SETTLED ONE ASSAULT AND BATTERY CASE AND PUT THE CHIEF OFFENDER UNDER ARREST
4799-25949-0052 MY ADMINISTRATION CAME TO AN END IN TWENTY MINUTES WHEN GENERAL WILSON RODE INTO COAMO AT THE HEAD OF HIS STAFF AND THREE THOUSAND MEN
4799-25949-0053 AND RAN OUT INTO THE STREET TO SNAP A PICTURE OF HIM HE LOOKED GREATLY SURPRISED AND ASKED ME WHAT I WAS DOING IN HIS TOWN THE TONE IN WHICH HE SPOKE
4799-25949-0054 I PULLED IT OFF MY SADDLE AND SAID GENERAL IT'S TOO LONG A STORY TO TELL YOU NOW BUT HERE IS THE FLAG OF THE TOWN IT'S THE FIRST SPANISH FLAG AND IT WAS THAT HAS BEEN CAPTURED IN PORTO RICO GENERAL WILSON SMILED AGAIN AND ACCEPTED THE FLAG
4799-25949-0055 HE AND ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND OTHER SOLDIERS THINK IT BELONGS TO THEM BUT THE TRUTH WILL OUT
