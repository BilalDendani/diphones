792-127528-0000 SILVER'S EMBASSY SURE ENOUGH THERE WERE TWO MEN JUST OUTSIDE THE STOCKADE ONE OF THEM WAVING A WHITE CLOTH THE OTHER NO LESS A PERSON THAN SILVER HIMSELF STANDING PLACIDLY BY
792-127528-0001 IT WAS STILL QUITE EARLY
792-127528-0002 A CHILL THAT PIERCED INTO THE MARROW THE SKY WAS BRIGHT AND CLOUDLESS OVERHEAD AND THE TOPS OF THE TREES SHONE ROSILY IN THE SUN BUT WHERE SILVER STOOD WITH HIS LIEUTENANT
792-127528-0003 THE CHILL AND THE VAPOUR TAKEN TOGETHER TOLD A POOR TALE OF THE ISLAND IT WAS PLAINLY A DAMP FEVERISH UNHEALTHY SPOT KEEP INDOORS MEN SAID THE CAPTAIN TEN TO ONE THIS IS A TRICK
792-127528-0004 THEN HE HAILED THE BUCCANEER WHO GOES STAND OR WE FIRE FLAG OF TRUCE CRIED SILVER THE CAPTAIN WAS IN THE PORCH KEEPING HIMSELF CAREFULLY OUT OF THE WAY OF A TREACHEROUS SHOT
792-127528-0005 SHOULD ANY BE INTENDED HE TURNED AND SPOKE TO US DOCTOR'S WATCH ON THE LOOKOUT
792-127528-0006 JIM THE EAST GRAY WEST THE WATCH BELOW ALL HANDS TO LOAD MUSKETS LIVELY MEN AND CAREFUL AND THEN HE TURNED AGAIN TO THE MUTINEERS AND WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH YOUR FLAG OF TRUCE
792-127528-0007 HE CRIED THIS TIME IT WAS THE OTHER MAN WHO REPLIED CAP'N SILVER SIR TO COME ON BOARD AND MAKE TERMS HE SHOUTED
792-127528-0008 DON'T KNOW HIM WHO'S HE CRIED THE CAPTAIN AND WE COULD HEAR HIM ADDING TO HIMSELF CAP'N IS IT MY HEART AND HERE'S PROMOTION LONG JOHN ANSWERED FOR HIMSELF ME SIR
792-127528-0009 THESE POOR LADS HAVE CHOSEN ME CAP'N AFTER YOUR DESERTION SIR LAYING A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS UPON THE WORD DESERTION WE'RE WILLING TO SUBMIT
792-127528-0010 IF WE CAN COME TO TERMS AND NO BONES ABOUT IT ALL I ASK IS YOUR WORD CAP'N SMOLLETT TO LET ME SAFE AND SOUND OUT OF THIS HERE STOCKADE AND ONE MINUTE TO GET OUT O SHOT BEFORE A GUN IS FIRED MY MAN

792-127528-0012 SHOUTED LONG JOHN CHEERILY
792-127528-0013 I KNOW A GENTLEMAN AND YOU MAY LAY TO THAT WE COULD SEE THE MAN WHO CARRIED THE FLAG OF TRUCE ATTEMPTING TO HOLD SILVER BACK NOR WAS THAT WONDERFUL SEEING HOW CAVALIER HAD BEEN THE CAPTAIN'S ANSWER
792-127528-0014 BUT SILVER LAUGHED AT HIM ALOUD AND SLAPPED HIM ON THE BACK AS IF THE IDEA OF ALARM HAD BEEN ABSURD THEN HE ADVANCED TO THE STOCKADE THREW OVER HIS CRUTCH GOT A LEG UP
792-127528-0015 AND WITH GREAT VIGOUR AND SKILL SUCCEEDED IN SURMOUNTING THE FENCE AND DROPPING SAFELY TO THE OTHER SIDE I WILL CONFESS THAT I WAS FAR TOO MUCH TAKEN UP WITH WHAT WAS GOING ON TO BE OF THE SLIGHTEST USE AS SENTRY
792-127528-0016 INDEED I HAD ALREADY DESERTED MY EASTERN LOOPHOLE AND CREPT UP BEHIND THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD NOW SEATED HIMSELF ON THE THRESHOLD
792-127528-0017 HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND HIS EYES FIXED ON THE WATER AS IT BUBBLED OUT OF THE OLD IRON KETTLE IN THE SAND HE WAS WHISTLING COME LASSES AND LADS SILVER HAD TERRIBLE HARD WORK GETTING UP THE KNOLL
792-127528-0018 WHAT WITH THE STEEPNESS OF THE INCLINE THE THICK TREE STUMPS AND THE SOFT SAND HE AND HIS CRUTCH WERE AS HELPLESS AS A SHIP IN STAYS BUT HE STUCK TO IT LIKE A MAN IN SILENCE AND AT LAST ARRIVED BEFORE THE CAPTAIN
792-127528-0019 WHOM HE SALUTED IN THE HANDSOMEST STYLE HE WAS TRICKED OUT IN HIS BEST AN IMMENSE BLUE COAT THICK WITH BRASS BUTTONS HUNG AS LOW AS TO HIS KNEES
792-127528-0020 YOU HAD BETTER SIT DOWN
