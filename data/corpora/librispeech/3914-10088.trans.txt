3914-10088-0000 IT WAS ALL TO HAVE MADE NONE THE LESS AS I HAVE SAID A DATE
3914-10088-0001 EVEN AFTER LONG INTERVALS OTHER THINGS THAT PASSED BETWEEN THEM WERE IN RELATION TO THIS HOUR BUT THE CHARACTER OF RECALLS AND RESULTS ITS IMMEDIATE EFFECT HAD BEEN INDEED RATHER TO LIGHTEN INSISTENCE ALMOST TO PROVOKE A REACTION
3914-10088-0002 AS IF THEIR TOPIC HAD DROPPED BY ITS OWN WEIGHT AND AS IF MOREOVER FOR THAT MATTER MARCHER HAD BEEN VISITED BY ONE OF HIS OCCASIONAL WARNINGS AGAINST EGOTISM HE HAD KEPT UP HE FELT AND VERY DECENTLY ON THE WHOLE
3914-10088-0003 HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT BEING SELFISH AND IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD NEVER SINNED IN THAT DIRECTION WITHOUT PROMPTLY ENOUGH TRYING TO PRESS THE SCALES THE OTHER WAY HE OFTEN REPAIRED HIS FAULT THE SEASON PERMITTING
3914-10088-0004 BY INVITING HIS FRIEND TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE OPERA AND IT NOT INFREQUENTLY THUS HAPPENED THAT TO SHOW HE DIDN'T WISH HER TO HAVE BUT ONE SORT OF FOOD FOR HER MIND HE WAS THE CAUSE OF HER APPEARING THERE WITH HIM A DOZEN NIGHTS IN THE MONTH
3914-10088-0005 IT EVEN HAPPENED THAT SEEING HER HOME AT SUCH TIMES HE OCCASIONALLY WENT IN WITH HER TO FINISH AS HE CALLED IT THE EVENING AND THE BETTER TO MAKE HIS POINT SAT DOWN TO THE FRUGAL BUT ALWAYS CAREFUL LITTLE SUPPER THAT AWAITED HIS PLEASURE
3914-10088-0006 HIS POINT WAS MADE HE THOUGHT BY HIS NOT ETERNALLY INSISTING WITH HER ON HIMSELF MADE FOR INSTANCE AT SUCH HOURS WHEN IT BEFELL THAT HER PIANO AT HAND AND EACH OF THEM FAMILIAR WITH IT THEY WENT OVER PASSAGES OF THE OPERA TOGETHER
3914-10088-0007 WHAT IS IT THAT SAVES YOU SAVED HER HE MEANT FROM THAT APPEARANCE OF VARIATION FROM THE USUAL HUMAN TYPE IF HE HAD PRACTICALLY ESCAPED REMARK AS SHE PRETENDED BY DOING IN THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTICULAR
3914-10088-0008 WHAT MOST MEN DO FIND THE ANSWER TO LIFE IN PATCHING UP AN ALLIANCE OF A SORT WITH A WOMAN NO BETTER THAN HIMSELF HOW HAD SHE ESCAPED IT AND HOW COULD THE ALLIANCE SUCH AS IT WAS SINCE THEY MUST SUPPOSE IT HAD BEEN MORE OR LESS NOTICED
3914-10088-0009 HAVE FAILED TO MAKE HER RATHER POSITIVELY TALKED ABOUT I NEVER SAID MAY BARTRAM REPLIED THAT IT HADN'T MADE ME A GOOD DEAL TALKED ABOUT AH WELL THEN YOU'RE NOT SAVED
3914-10088-0010 IT HASN'T BEEN A QUESTION FOR ME IF YOU'VE HAD YOUR WOMAN I'VE HAD SHE SAID MY MAN AND YOU MEAN THAT MAKES YOU ALL RIGHT OH IT WAS ALWAYS AS IF THERE WERE SO MUCH TO SAY
3914-10088-0011 I DON'T KNOW WHY IT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME HUMANLY WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE SPEAKING OF AS RIGHT AS IT MAKES YOU I SEE MARCHER RETURNED HUMANLY NO DOUBT
3914-10088-0012 AS SHOWING THAT YOU'RE LIVING FOR SOMETHING NOT THAT IS JUST FOR ME AND MY SECRET MAY BARTRAM SMILED I DON'T PRETEND IT EXACTLY SHOWS THAT I'M NOT LIVING FOR YOU IT'S MY INTIMACY WITH YOU THAT'S IN QUESTION
3914-10088-0013 SHE HAD HER LAST GRAVE PAUSE AS IF THERE MIGHT BE A CHOICE OF WAYS BUT SHE CHOSE BY GOING ON AS YOU ARE IT WAS INTO THIS GOING ON AS HE WAS
3914-10088-0014 THAT THEY RELAPSED AND REALLY FOR SO LONG A TIME THAT THE DAY INEVITABLY CAME FOR A FURTHER SOUNDING OF THEIR DEPTHS THESE DEPTHS CONSTANTLY BRIDGED OVER BY A STRUCTURE FIRM ENOUGH IN SPITE OF ITS LIGHTNESS
3914-10088-0015 BY THE FACT THAT SHE HAD ALL THE WHILE NOT APPEARED TO FEEL THE NEED OF REBUTTING HIS CHARGE OF AN IDEA WITHIN HER THAT SHE DIDN'T DARE TO EXPRESS A CHARGE UTTERED JUST BEFORE ONE OF THE FULLEST OF THEIR LATER DISCUSSIONS ENDED
3914-10088-0016 IT HAD COME UP FOR HIM THEN THAT SHE KNEW SOMETHING AND THAT WHAT SHE KNEW WAS BAD TOO BAD TO TELL HIM WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN OF IT AS VISIBLY SO BAD THAT SHE WAS AFRAID HE MIGHT FIND IT OUT
3914-10088-0017 HER REPLY HAD LEFT THE MATTER TOO EQUIVOCAL TO BE LET ALONE AND YET FOR MARCHER'S SPECIAL SENSIBILITY ALMOST TOO FORMIDABLE AGAIN TO TOUCH HE CIRCLED ABOUT IT
3914-10088-0018 AT A DISTANCE THAT ALTERNATELY NARROWED AND WIDENED AND THAT STILL WASN'T MUCH AFFECTED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS IN HIM THAT THERE WAS NOTHING SHE COULD KNOW AFTER ALL ANY BETTER THAN HE DID SHE HAD NO SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE HE HADN'T EQUALLY
3914-10088-0019 EXCEPT OF COURSE THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE FINER NERVES THAT WAS WHAT WOMEN HAD WHERE THEY WERE INTERESTED THEY MADE OUT THINGS WHERE PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED THAT THE PEOPLE OFTEN COULDN'T HAVE MADE OUT FOR THEMSELVES THEIR NERVES THEIR SENSIBILITY
3914-10088-0020 THEIR IMAGINATION WERE CONDUCTORS AND REVEALERS AND THE BEAUTY OF MAY BARTRAM WAS IN PARTICULAR THAT SHE HAD GIVEN HERSELF SO TO HIS CASE HE FELT IN THESE DAYS WHAT ODDLY ENOUGH HE HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE
3914-10088-0021 THE GROWTH OF A DREAD OF LOSING HER BY SOME CATASTROPHE SOME CATASTROPHE THAT YET WOULDN'T AT ALL BE THE CATASTROPHE PARTLY BECAUSE SHE HAD ALMOST OF A SUDDEN BEGUN TO STRIKE HIM AS MORE USEFUL TO HIM THAN EVER YET
3914-10088-0022 EVEN TO THE POINT OF MAKING HIM ASK HIMSELF IF HE WERE BY ANY CHANCE OF A TRUTH WITHIN SIGHT OR SOUND WITHIN TOUCH OR REACH WITHIN THE IMMEDIATE JURISDICTION OF THE THING THAT WAITED WHEN THE DAY CAME
3914-10088-0023 AS COME IT HAD TO THAT HIS FRIEND CONFESSED TO HIM HER FEAR OF A DEEP DISORDER IN HER BLOOD HE FELT SOMEHOW THE SHADOW OF A CHANGE AND THE CHILL OF A SHOCK
3914-10088-0024 AND ABOVE ALL TO THINK OF HER PERIL AS THE DIRECT MENACE FOR HIMSELF OF PERSONAL PRIVATION
3914-10088-0025 IN THE EARLY STAGES OF HER TROUBLE TO PUT THAT QUESTION TO HER BUT IT HAD IMMEDIATELY SOUNDED FOR HIM TO HIS OWN CONCERN AND THE POSSIBILITY WAS WHAT MOST MADE HIM SORRY FOR HER IF SHE DID KNOW MOREOVER
3914-10088-0026 IN THE SENSE OF HER HAVING HAD SOME WHAT SHOULD HE THINK MYSTICAL IRRESISTIBLE LIGHT THIS WOULD MAKE THE MATTER NOT BETTER BUT WORSE INASMUCH AS HER ORIGINAL ADOPTION OF HIS OWN CURIOSITY
3914-10088-0027 HAD QUITE BECOME THE BASIS OF HER LIFE SHE HAD BEEN LIVING TO SEE WHAT WOULD BE TO BE SEEN
3914-10088-0028 TO HAVE TO GIVE UP BEFORE THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE VISION THESE REFLEXIONS AS I SAY QUICKENED HIS GENEROSITY YET MAKE THEM AS HE MIGHT HE SAW HIMSELF WITH THE LAPSE OF THE PERIOD MORE AND MORE DISCONCERTED
3914-10088-0029 IT LAPSED FOR HIM WITH A STRANGE STEADY SWEEP AND THE ODDEST ODDITY WAS THAT IT GAVE HIM INDEPENDENTLY OF THE THREAT OF MUCH INCONVENIENCE ALMOST THE ONLY POSITIVE SURPRISE HIS CAREER
3914-10088-0030 IF CAREER IT COULD BE CALLED HAD YET OFFERED HIM SHE KEPT THE HOUSE AS SHE HAD NEVER DONE HE HAD TO GO TO HER TO SEE HER SHE COULD MEET HIM NOWHERE NOW
3914-10088-0031 HE HAD BEEN STRUCK ONE DAY AFTER AN ABSENCE EXCEEDING HIS USUAL MEASURE WITH HER SUDDENLY LOOKING MUCH OLDER TO HIM THAN HE HAD EVER THOUGHT OF HER BEING THEN HE RECOGNISED THAT THE SUDDENNESS WAS ALL ON HIS SIDE
3914-10088-0032 HE HAD JUST SIMPLY AND SUDDENLY NOTICED SHE LOOKED OLDER BECAUSE INEVITABLY AFTER SO MANY YEARS SHE WAS OLD OR ALMOST WHICH WAS OF COURSE TRUE IN STILL GREATER MEASURE OF HER COMPANION
3914-10088-0033 IF SHE WAS OLD OR ALMOST JOHN MARCHER ASSUREDLY WAS AND YET IT WAS HER SHOWING OF THE LESSON NOT HIS OWN THAT BROUGHT THE TRUTH HOME TO HIM HIS SURPRISES BEGAN HERE
3914-10088-0034 WHEN ONCE THEY HAD BEGUN THEY MULTIPLIED THEY CAME RATHER WITH A RUSH IT WAS AS IF
3914-10088-0035 THEY HAD ALL BEEN KEPT BACK SOWN IN A THICK CLUSTER FOR THE LATE AFTERNOON OF LIFE THE TIME AT WHICH FOR PEOPLE IN GENERAL THE UNEXPECTED HAS DIED OUT ONE OF THEM
3914-10088-0036 PASS AWAY FROM HIM HE HAD NEVER SO UNRESERVEDLY QUALIFIED HER AS WHILE CONFRONTED IN THOUGHT WITH SUCH A POSSIBILITY IN SPITE OF WHICH THERE WAS SMALL DOUBT FOR HIM THAT AS AN ANSWER TO HIS LONG RIDDLE
3914-10088-0037 THE MERE EFFACEMENT OF EVEN SO FINE A FEATURE OF HIS SITUATION WOULD BE AN ABJECT ANTICLIMAX IT WOULD REPRESENT AS CONNECTED WITH HIS PAST ATTITUDE A DROP OF DIGNITY
3914-10088-0038 UNDER THE SHADOW OF WHICH HIS EXISTENCE COULD ONLY BECOME THE MOST GROTESQUES OF FAILURES HE HAD BEEN FAR FROM HOLDING IT A FAILURE LONG AS HE HAD WAITED FOR THE APPEARANCE THAT WAS TO MAKE IT A SUCCESS HE HAD WAITED FOR QUITE ANOTHER THING
3914-10088-0039 NOT FOR SUCH A THING AS THAT THE BREATH OF HIS GOOD FAITH CAME SHORT HOWEVER AS HE RECOGNISED HOW LONG HE HAD WAITED OR HOW LONG AT LEAST HIS COMPANION HAD THAT SHE AT ALL EVENTS MIGHT BE RECORDED
3914-10088-0040 AS HAVING WAITED IN VAIN THIS AFFECTED HIM SHARPLY AND ALL THE MORE BECAUSE OF HIS AT FIRST HAVING DONE LITTLE MORE THAN AMUSE HIMSELF WITH THE IDEA IT GREW MORE GRAVE AS THE GRAVITY OF HER CONDITION GREW
3914-10088-0041 AND THE STATE OF MIND IT PRODUCED IN HIM WHICH HE HIMSELF ENDED BY WATCHING AS IF IT HAD BEEN SOME DEFINITE DISFIGUREMENT OF HIS OUTER PERSON MAY PASS FOR ANOTHER OF HIS SURPRISES THIS CONJOINED ITSELF STILL WITH ANOTHER
3914-10088-0042 AND THE SOUNDLESS ADMONITION OF IT ALL UNLESS THAT AT THIS TIME OF DAY IT WAS SIMPLY IT WAS OVERWHELMINGLY TOO LATE HE HAD NEVER AT ANY STAGE OF HIS QUEER CONSCIOUSNESS ADMITTED THE WHISPER OF SUCH A CORRECTION
3914-10088-0043 HE HAD NEVER TILL WITHIN THESE LAST FEW MONTHS BEEN SO FALSE TO HIS CONVICTION AS NOT TO HOLD THAT WHAT WAS TO COME TO HIM HAD TIME WHETHER HE STRUCK HIMSELF AS HAVING IT OR NOT THAT AT LAST
3914-10088-0044 AT LAST HE CERTAINLY HADN'T IT TO SPEAK OF OR HAD IT BUT IN THE SCANTIEST MEASURE SUCH SOON ENOUGH AS THINGS WENT WITH HIM BECAME THE INFERENCE WITH WHICH HIS OLD OBSESSION HAD TO RECKON
3914-10088-0045 AND THIS IT WAS NOT HELPED TO DO BY THE MORE AND MORE CONFIRMED APPEARANCE THAT THE GREAT VAGUENESS CASTING THE LONG SHADOW IN WHICH HE HAD LIVED HAD TO ATTEST ITSELF ALMOST NO MARGIN LEFT
3914-10088-0046 SINCE IT WAS IN TIME THAT HE WAS TO HAVE MET HIS FATE SO IT WAS IN TIME THAT HIS FATE WAS TO HAVE ACTED AND AS HE WAKED UP TO THE SENSE OF NO LONGER BEING YOUNG
3914-10088-0047 WHICH WAS EXACTLY THE SENSE OF BEING STALE JUST AS THAT IN TURN WAS THE SENSE OF BEING WEAK HE WAKED UP TO ANOTHER MATTER BESIDE IT ALL HUNG TOGETHER
3914-10088-0048 THAT AND THAT ONLY WAS FAILURE IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FAILURE TO BE BANKRUPT DISHONOURED PILLORIED HANGED IT WAS FAILURE NOT TO BE ANYTHING
3914-10088-0049 AND SO IN THE DARK VALLEY INTO WHICH HIS PATH HAD TAKEN ITS UNLOOKED FOR TWIST HE WONDERED NOT A LITTLE AS HE GROPED HE DIDN'T CARE WHAT AWFUL CRASH MIGHT OVERTAKE HIM
3914-10088-0050 SINCE HE WASN'T AFTER ALL TOO UTTERLY OLD TO SUFFER IF IT WOULD ONLY BE DECENTLY PROPORTIONATE TO THE POSTURE HE HAD KEPT ALL HIS LIFE IN THE THREATENED PRESENCE OF IT HE HAD BUT ONE DESIRE LEFT
