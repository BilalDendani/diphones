3990-31892-0000 SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF GREATEST DESPAIR
3990-31892-0001 I HAD WRITTEN MY MISTRESS SAYING THAT I NEVER WISHED TO SEE HER AGAIN I KEPT MY WORD BUT I PASSED THE NIGHTS UNDER HER WINDOW SEATED ON A BENCH BEFORE HER DOOR
3990-31892-0002 I COULD SEE THE LIGHTS IN HER ROOM I COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF HER PIANO AT TIMES I SAW SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A SHADOW THROUGH THE PARTIALLY DRAWN CURTAINS
3990-31892-0003 ONE NIGHT AS I WAS SEATED ON THE BENCH PLUNGED IN FRIGHTFUL MELANCHOLY I SAW A BELATED WORKMAN STAGGERING ALONG THE STREET
3990-31892-0004 HE MUTTERED A FEW WORDS IN A DAZED MANNER AND THEN BEGAN TO SING HE WAS SO MUCH UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF LIQUOR THAT HE WALKED AT TIMES ON ONE SIDE OF THE GUTTER AND THEN ON THE OTHER
3990-31892-0005 FINALLY HE FELL ON A BENCH FACING ANOTHER HOUSE OPPOSITE ME THERE HE LAY STILL SUPPORTED ON HIS ELBOWS AND SLEPT PROFOUNDLY THE STREET WAS DESERTED
3990-31892-0006 A DRY WIND SWEPT THE DUST HERE AND THERE THE MOON SHONE THROUGH A RIFT IN THE CLOUDS AND LIGHTED THE SPOT WHERE THE MAN SLEPT SO I FOUND MYSELF TETE A TETE WITH THIS MAN WHO
3990-31892-0007 NOT SUSPECTING MY PRESENCE WAS SLEEPING ON THAT STONE BENCH AS PEACEFULLY AS THOUGH IN HIS OWN BED HE SERVED TO DIVERT MY GRIEF I AROSE TO LEAVE HIM IN FULL POSSESSION
3990-31892-0008 THEN RETURNED AND RESUMED MY SEAT I COULD NOT LEAVE THAT DOOR AT WHICH I WOULD NOT HAVE KNOCKED FOR AN EMPIRE
3990-31892-0009 I STOPPED BEFORE THE SLEEPER WHAT SLEEP I SAID SURELY THIS MAN DOES NOT DREAM HIS CLOTHES ARE IN TATTERS HIS CHEEKS ARE WRINKLED HIS HANDS HARDENED WITH TOIL
3990-31892-0010 HE IS SOME UNFORTUNATE WHO DOES NOT HAVE BREAD EVERY DAY A THOUSAND GNAWING CARES A THOUSAND MORTAL SORROWS AWAIT HIS RETURN TO CONSCIOUSNESS
3990-31892-0011 NEVERTHELESS THIS EVENING HE HAD A PIECE OF MONEY IN HIS POCKET HE ENTERED A TAVERN WHERE HE PURCHASED OBLIVION HE HAS EARNED ENOUGH IN A WEEK TO ENJOY A NIGHT OF SLUMBER
3990-31892-0012 NOW HIS MISTRESS CAN BETRAY HIM HIS FRIEND CAN GLIDE LIKE A THIEF INTO HIS HUT I COULD SHAKE HIM BY THE SHOULDER AND TELL HIM THAT HE IS BEING MURDERED THAT HIS HOUSE IS ON FIRE
3990-31892-0013 HE WOULD TURN OVER AND CONTINUE TO SLEEP AND I I DO NOT SLEEP I CONTINUED PACING UP AND DOWN THE STREET I DO NOT SLEEP I
3990-31892-0014 I AM SO PROUD AND SO FOOLISH THAT I DARE NOT ENTER A TAVERN AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT IF ALL UNFORTUNATES ENTER THERE IT IS IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY COME OUT HAPPY OH
3990-31892-0015 GOD THE JUICE OF A GRAPE CRUSHED UNDER THE FOOT SUFFICES TO DISSIPATE THE DEEPEST SORROW AND TO BREAK ALL THE INVISIBLE THREADS THAT THE FATES WEAVE ABOUT OUR PATHWAY WE WEEP LIKE WOMEN WE SUFFER LIKE MARTYRS
3990-31892-0016 AND WE SIT DOWN IN OUR TEARS AS DID ADAM AT EDEN'S GATE AND IN ORDER TO CURE OUR WOUND WE HAVE BUT TO MAKE A MOVEMENT OF THE HAND AND MOISTEN OUR THROATS
3990-31892-0017 HOW PITIABLE OUR GRIEF SINCE IT CAN BE THUS ASSUAGED WE ARE SURPRISED THAT PROVIDENCE DOES NOT SEND ANGELS TO GRANT OUR PRAYERS IT NEED NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE
3990-31892-0018 FOR IT HAS SEEN OUR WOES
3990-31892-0019 THE OCEAN OF EVIL THAT SURROUNDS US AND IS CONTENT TO HANG A SMALL BLACK FRUIT ALONG OUR PATHS SINCE THAT MAN SLEEPS SO SOUNDLY ON HIS BENCH WHY DO NOT I SLEEP ON MINE
3990-31892-0020 MY RIVAL IS DOUBTLESS PASSING THE NIGHT WITH MY MISTRESS HE WILL LEAVE HER AT DAYBREAK SHE WILL ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE DOOR AND THEY WILL SEE ME ASLEEP ON MY BENCH
3990-31892-0021 THEIR KISSES WILL NOT AWAKEN ME AND THEY WILL SHAKE ME BY THE SHOULDER I WILL TURN OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE AND SLEEP ON THUS INSPIRED BY A FIERCE JOY
3990-31892-0022 I SET OUT IN QUEST OF A TAVERN AS IT WAS PAST MIDNIGHT SOME WERE CLOSED THAT PUT ME IN A FURY WHAT I CRIED EVEN THAT CONSOLATION IS REFUSED ME
3990-31892-0023 I RAN HITHER AND THITHER KNOCKING AT THE DOORS OF TAVERNS CRYING WINE WINE AT LAST I FOUND ONE OPEN I CALLED FOR A BOTTLE
3990-31892-0024 AND WITHOUT CARING WHETHER IT WAS GOOD OR BAD I GULPED IT DOWN A SECOND FOLLOWED AND THEN A THIRD I DOSED MYSELF AS WITH MEDICINE
3990-31892-0025 AND I FORCED THE WINE DOWN AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN PRESCRIBED BY A PHYSICIAN TO SAVE MY LIFE THE HEAVY FUMES OF THE LIQUOR WHICH WAS DOUBTLESS ADULTERATED MOUNTED TO MY HEAD
3990-31892-0026 AS I HAD GULPED IT DOWN AT A BREATH DRUNKENNESS SEIZED ME PROMPTLY I FELT THAT I WAS BECOMING MUDDLED THEN I EXPERIENCED A LUCID MOMENT THEN CONFUSION FOLLOWED
3990-31892-0027 THEN CONSCIOUSNESS LEFT ME I LEANED MY ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND SAID ADIEU TO MYSELF BUT I HAD A CONFUSED IDEA THAT I WAS NOT ALONE IN THE TAVERN
3990-31892-0028 BUT WERE NOT BOURGEOIS IN SHORT THEY BELONGED TO THAT AMBIGUOUS CLASS
3990-31892-0029 WHICH HAS NEITHER FORTUNE NOR OCCUPATION WHICH NEVER WORKS EXCEPT AT SOME CRIMINAL PLOT WHICH IS NEITHER POOR NOR RICH
3990-31892-0030 THEY WERE DISPUTING OVER A DIRTY PACK OF CARDS AMONG THEM I SAW A GIRL WHO APPEARED TO BE VERY YOUNG AND VERY PRETTY DECENTLY CLAD
3990-31892-0031 AND RESEMBLING HER COMPANIONS IN NO WAY EXCEPT IN THE HARSHNESS OF HER VOICE WHICH WAS ROUGH AND BROKEN AS THOUGH IT HAD PERFORMED THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC CRIER SHE LOOKED AT ME CLOSELY
3990-31892-0032 AS THOUGH ASTONISHED TO SEE ME IN SUCH A PLACE FOR I WAS ELEGANTLY ATTIRED LITTLE BY LITTLE SHE APPROACHED MY TABLE AND SEEING THAT ALL THE BOTTLES WERE EMPTY SMILED
3990-31892-0033 I SAW THAT SHE HAD FINE TEETH OF BRILLIANT WHITENESS I TOOK HER HAND AND BEGGED HER TO BE SEATED SHE CONSENTED WITH GOOD GRACE AND ASKED WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE FOR SUPPER
3990-31892-0034 SHE OBSERVED MY EMOTION AND INQUIRED THE CAUSE I COULD NOT REPLY SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT I HAD SOME SECRET SORROW AND FOREBORE ANY ATTEMPT TO LEARN THE CAUSE
3990-31892-0035 DRAWING HER HANDKERCHIEF SHE DRIED MY TEARS FROM TIME TO TIME AS WE DINED THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT GIRL THAT WAS AT ONCE REPULSIVE AND SWEET
3990-31892-0036 A SINGULAR IMPUDENCE MINGLED WITH PITY THAT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IF SHE HAD TAKEN MY HAND IN THE STREET SHE WOULD HAVE INSPIRED A FEELING OF HORROR IN ME
3990-31892-0037 BUT IT SEEMED SO STRANGE THAT A CREATURE I HAD NEVER SEEN SHOULD COME TO ME AND WITHOUT A WORD PROCEED TO ORDER SUPPER AND DRY MY TEARS WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF THAT I WAS RENDERED SPEECHLESS
3990-31892-0038 REVOLTED AND YET CHARMED WHAT I HAD DONE HAD BEEN DONE SO QUICKLY THAT I SEEMED TO HAVE OBEYED SOME IMPULSE OF DESPAIR
3990-31892-0039 I SUDDENLY CRIED OUT WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME HOW DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM WHO TOLD YOU TO DRY MY TEARS IS THIS YOUR VOCATION AND DO YOU THINK I DESIRE YOU
3990-31892-0040 I WOULD NOT TOUCH YOU WITH THE TIP OF MY FINGER WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE REPLY AT ONCE IS IT MONEY YOU WANT WHAT PRICE DO YOU PUT ON YOUR PITY I AROSE AND TRIED TO GO OUT
3990-31892-0041 BUT MY FEET REFUSED TO SUPPORT ME AT THE SAME TIME MY EYES FAILED ME A MORTAL WEAKNESS TOOK POSSESSION OF ME AND I FELL OVER A CHAIR YOU ARE NOT WELL SHE SAID TAKING ME BY THE ARM
3990-31892-0042 YOU HAVE DRUNK LIKE THE CHILD THAT YOU ARE WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT YOU WERE DOING SIT DOWN IN THIS CHAIR AND WAIT UNTIL A CAB PASSES YOU WILL TELL ME WHERE YOU LIVE AND I WILL ORDER THE DRIVER TO TAKE YOU HOME TO YOUR MOTHER
3990-31892-0043 SINCE SHE ADDED YOU REALLY FIND ME UGLY AS SHE SPOKE I RAISED MY EYES PERHAPS MY DRUNKENNESS DECEIVED ME OR PERHAPS I HAD NOT SEEN HER FACE CLEARLY BEFORE
3990-31892-0044 BUT SUDDENLY I DETECTED IN THAT UNFORTUNATE A FATAL RESEMBLANCE TO MY MISTRESS I SHUDDERED AT THE SIGHT THERE IS A CERTAIN SHUDDER THAT AFFECTS THE HAIR
3990-31892-0045 SOME SAY IT IS DEATH PASSING OVER THE HEAD BUT IT WAS NOT DEATH THAT PASSED OVER MINE IT WAS THE MALADY OF THE AGE
3990-31892-0046 AND IT WAS SHE WHO WITH HER PALE HALF MOCKING FEATURES
