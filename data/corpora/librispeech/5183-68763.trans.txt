5183-68763-0000 CHAPTER FOUR KENNETH TAKES A BOLD STEP THIS MAN HOPKINS GETS ON MY NERVES SAID MISTER WATSON A WEEK OR TWO AFTER THE EVENTFUL MEETING IN THE SCHOOL HOUSE
5183-68763-0001 HE WAS AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE OPPOSITE KENNETH AND HELD UP A BIG GLARING POST CARD WHICH WAS IN HIS MAIL WHAT IS IT NOW ASKED THE BOY ROUSING HIMSELF FROM A FIT OF ABSTRACTION
5183-68763-0002 AN ANNOUNCEMENT OFFERING HIMSELF FOR RENOMINATION AT THE PRIMARIES IT'S LIKE A CIRCUS ADVERTISEMENT ISN'T IT A SHAME TO THINK THAT MODERN POLITICS HAS DESCENDED TO SUCH A LEVEL
5183-68763-0003 IN OUR FREE AND ENLIGHTENED REPUBLIC KENNETH NODDED STIRRING HIS COFFEE THOUGHTFULLY
5183-68763-0004 SINCE THE MEETING AND WAS FAST RELAPSING INTO HIS OLD STATE OF APATHY AND BOREDOM IT GRIEVED MISTER WATSON TO NOTE THIS
5183-68763-0005 OBSERVED THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH SUDDEN ENERGY THE BOY LOOKED AT HIM WHO IS HOPKINS HE ASKED
5183-68763-0006 AND FINALLY HE RAN LAST TERM FOR STATE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THIS DISTRICT AND WAS ELECTED BY A MIGHTY SMALL MAJORITY WHY SMALL ASKED KENNETH BECAUSE HE'S A DEMOCRAT AND THE
5183-68763-0007 DISTRICT IS STRONGLY REPUBLICAN BUT THOMPSON RAN AGAINST HIM ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKET AND COULDN'T WIN HIS PARTY VOTE
5183-68763-0008 THE GENERAL STORE KEEPER HE HAS A REPUTATION FOR SHORT WEIGHTS AND MEASURES THE BOY SIPPED HIS COFFEE THOUGHTFULLY TELL ME SIR HOW DID YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW ALL THIS HE ASKED
5183-68763-0009 MISTER WATSON SHIFTED UNEASILY IN HIS CHAIR I WONDER IF WE HAVE HE SAID WHY NOT SIR WELL KENNETH
5183-68763-0010 ALSO I BELIEVE ELMHURST TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT ESTATE IN THE DISTRICT
5183-68763-0011 IRRITABLY OH DO AS YOU LIKE MY BOY IF YOU CAN SHIRK YOUR DUTIES WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE I'VE NOTHING TO SAY FOR A TIME THE YOUNG MAN WAS SILENT FINALLY HE ASKED WHY ISN'T HOPKINS A GOOD REPRESENTATIVE
5183-68763-0012 AGAIN THE BOY FELL INTO A THOUGHTFUL MOOD MISTER WATSON AM I A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN
5183-68763-0013 NO SIR I HAVEN'T ASKED MYSELF BEFORE THEN I ADVISE YOU TO BE A REPUBLICAN
5183-68763-0014 WHY BECAUSE HOPKINS IS A DEMOCRAT AND WE MAY THEN FIGHT HIM OPENLY
5183-68763-0015 DIFFERENCE OF IMPORTANCE ALL AMERICANS ARE LOYAL CITIZENS WHICHEVER SIDE THEY ADOPT IN POLITICS BUT THE TWO PARTIES ARE THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE POLES
5183-68763-0016 AND KEEP IT GOING PROPERLY ALSO THEY SAFEGUARD OUR INTERESTS BY WATCHING ONE ANOTHER WHAT IS YOUR PREFERENCE SIR I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A REPUBLICAN WHENEVER I DABBLED IN POLITICS WHICH HASN'T BEEN OFTEN THEN I WILL BE A REPUBLICAN
5183-68763-0017 I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT POLITICS AND HAVE NO CONVICTIONS ON THE SUBJECT
5183-68763-0018 AND THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES SEEM SHY ABOUT COMING FORWARD DIDN'T YOU SAY THE DISTRICT WAS REPUBLICAN YES BUT SINCE HOPKINS DEFEATED THEM LAST TERM
5183-68763-0019 THAT FEELING WILL PROBABLY ELECT MISTER HOPKINS DECLARED KENNETH WITH CONVICTION UNLESS UNLESS WHAT SIR UNLESS WE COME TO THE RESCUE OF THE REPUBLICANS AND TAKE A HAND IN LOCAL POLITICS OURSELVES MY LAD
5183-68763-0020 HE WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND STOOD THERE WHISTLING FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN LEFT THE ROOM WITHOUT A WORD FOR A TIME MISTER WATSON SAT SILENTLY MUSING
5183-68763-0021 PERHAPS I'M INVITING TROUBLE HE MURMURED BUT I AM SURE I AM DOING RIGHT THE BOY NEEDS A GOOD SHAKING UP AND MORE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS FELLOW MEN IF I CAN GET KENNETH INTERESTED THIS PLAN OF MINE WILL BE OF GREAT BENEFIT TO HIM
5183-68763-0022 THEN HE TOO LEFT THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND WANDERING INTO THE GARDEN SAW KENNETH BUSY AT HIS EASEL IN A SHADY CORNER FOR A DAY OR SO THE SUBJECT WAS NOT RESUMED AND THEN MISTER WATSON CASUALLY INTRODUCED IT
5183-68763-0023 A LAW COULD BE PASSED IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE FORBIDDING THE DISPLAY OF ALL ADVERTISING SIGNS IN PUBLIC PLACES IN THIS COUNTY HE SUGGESTED THE BOY LOOKED AT HIM EAGERLY ARE YOU SURE HE ASKED I AM POSITIVE
5183-68763-0024 IT IS MERELY A QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE AND YOU THINK WE MIGHT HIRE HOPKINS TO PASS SUCH A LAW
5183-68763-0025 THEN HE WALKED AWAY LEAVING KENNETH MUCH PLEASED WITH THE IDEA HE HAD ADVANCED INDEED HE WAS SO MUCH INTERESTED IN THE SUGGESTION THAT HE HIMSELF REFERRED TO THE SUBJECT AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY
5183-68763-0026 ONCE I'VE UNDERTAKEN TO DO A THING HE SAID
5183-68763-0027 THE OLD LAWYER REPLIED SMILING
5183-68763-0028 WITH ENOUGH INFLUENCE TO WIN THE VOTES TO CARRY SUCH A UNIQUE MEASURE THROUGH AND WHO IS THAT SIR
5183-68763-0029 THE LARGEST TAXPAYER IN THE COUNTY ME SIR YOU'RE THE MAN
5183-68763-0030 MIGHT NOT ONLY BEAUTIFY YOUR DISTRICT BY HAVING THOSE OBJECTIONABLE SIGNS PROHIBITED BUT DO MANY OTHER THINGS TO BETTER THE CONDITION OF THE FARMERS AND THAT ISN'T ALL WHAT'S THE REST MISTER WATSON
5183-68763-0031 YOU OWE SOMETHING TO YOURSELF LAD ALL YOUR YOUNG LIFE YOU'VE BEEN TOO SELF CONTAINED AND EXCLUSIVE IN YOUR HABITS THE NOBLEST STUDY OF MANKIND IS MAN IT WOULD BROADEN YOU TO GO INTO POLITICS FOR A TIME AND
5183-68763-0032 DO MUCH TO DEVELOP YOUR CHARACTER AND RELIEVE THE MONOTONY OF YOUR EXISTENCE KENNETH FROWNED
5183-68763-0033 A HARD ONE FOR HOPKINS WON'T GIVE UP HIS JOB IF HE CAN HELP IT
5183-68763-0034 IF I THOUGHT IF I BELIEVED I COULD FILL THE POSITION WITH CREDIT I MIGHT UNDERTAKE IT I'LL ANSWER FOR THAT RETORTED THE OLD MAN HIGHLY PLEASED WITH HIS EASY VICTORY
5183-68763-0035 YOU WIN THE FIGHT KEN AND I'LL GUARANTEE YOU'LL OUTCLASS THE MAJORITY OF YOUR FELLOW REPRESENTATIVES IT'S A GOOD STATE TOO
5183-68763-0036 AND INTERVIEWED THE FARMERS AND TOWNSMEN OF THE LEGISLATIVE DISTRICT
5183-68763-0037 HAD DETERMINED TO ENTER POLITICS AND ASKED FOR THE NOMINATION OF REPRESENTATIVE NO OTHER REPUBLICAN VENTURED TO OPPOSE HIM IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN A HARD FIGHT AND EVEN THE MOST STURDY REPUBLICAN WAS INCLINED
5183-68763-0038 TO FEAR THAT THE PRESENT INCUMBENT OF THE OFFICE WOULD BE ELECTED TO SUCCEED HIMSELF SO THE PRIMARIES WERE HELD AND KENNETH ATTENDED AND MADE A SPEECH AND WAS WARMLY APPLAUDED
5183-68763-0039 AND HE WENT HOME THE UNANIMOUS CHOICE OF HIS PARTY
5183-68763-0040 VENTURED TO RISK DEFEAT THE HON ERASTUS HOPKINS WELL KNEW THIS FEELING AND SMILED IN HIS POMPOUS AND MOST SARDONIC MANNER WHEN HE LEARNED WHO WAS HIS OPPONENT
5183-68763-0041 MISTER HOPKINS CONFIDED TO HIS CRONIES BUT HE DIDN'T INTEND TO TAKE CHANCES SO HE BEGAN THE CAMPAIGN WITH HIS USUAL VIGOR IT WAS NOW THE MIDDLE OF SEPTEMBER
