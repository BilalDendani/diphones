5622-41172-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY TWO BEFORE VRONSKY'S DEPARTURE FOR THE ELECTIONS ANNA HAD REFLECTED THAT THE SCENES CONSTANTLY REPEATED BETWEEN THEM EACH TIME HE LEFT HOME MIGHT ONLY MAKE HIM COLD TO HER INSTEAD OF ATTACHING HIM TO HER
5622-41172-0001 AND RESOLVED TO DO ALL SHE COULD TO CONTROL HERSELF SO AS TO BEAR THE PARTING WITH COMPOSURE BUT THE COLD SEVERE GLANCE WITH WHICH HE HAD LOOKED AT HER WHEN HE CAME TO TELL HER HE WAS GOING HAD WOUNDED HER AND BEFORE HE HAD STARTED
5622-41172-0002 HER PEACE OF MIND WAS DESTROYED IN SOLITUDE AFTERWARDS THINKING OVER THAT GLANCE WHICH HAD EXPRESSED HIS RIGHT TO FREEDOM SHE CAME AS SHE ALWAYS DID TO THE SAME POINT THE SENSE OF HER OWN HUMILIATION
5622-41172-0003 SHOWS THE BEGINNING OF INDIFFERENCE AND THOUGH SHE FELT SURE THAT A COLDNESS WAS BEGINNING THERE WAS NOTHING SHE COULD DO SHE COULD NOT IN ANY WAY ALTER HER RELATIONS TO HIM JUST AS BEFORE
5622-41172-0004 AND SHE BEGAN TO LONG FOR THAT AND MADE UP HER MIND TO AGREE TO IT THE FIRST TIME
5622-41172-0005 ABSORBED IN SUCH THOUGHTS SHE PASSED FIVE DAYS WITHOUT HIM THE FIVE DAYS THAT HE WAS TO BE AT THE ELECTIONS WALKS
5622-41172-0006 READING OF ONE BOOK AFTER ANOTHER FILLED UP HER TIME BUT ON THE SIXTH DAY WHEN THE COACHMAN CAME BACK WITHOUT HIM SHE FELT THAT NOW SHE WAS UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF STIFLING THE THOUGHT OF HIM AND OF WHAT HE WAS DOING THERE JUST AT THAT TIME HER LITTLE GIRL WAS TAKEN ILL
5622-41172-0007 ANNA BEGAN TO LOOK AFTER HER BUT EVEN THAT DID NOT DISTRACT HER MIND ESPECIALLY AS THE ILLNESS WAS NOT SERIOUS HOWEVER HARD SHE TRIED SHE COULD NOT LOVE THIS LITTLE CHILD AND TO FEIGN LOVE WAS BEYOND HER POWERS
5622-41172-0008 TOWARDS THE EVENING OF THAT DAY STILL ALONE ANNA WAS IN SUCH A PANIC ABOUT HIM THAT SHE DECIDED TO START FOR THE TOWN BUT ON SECOND THOUGHTS WROTE HIM THE CONTRADICTORY LETTER THAT VRONSKY RECEIVED
5622-41172-0009 AND WITHOUT READING IT THROUGH SENT IT OFF BY A SPECIAL MESSENGER THE NEXT MORNING SHE RECEIVED HIS LETTER AND REGRETTED HER OWN SHE DREADED A REPETITION OF THE SEVERE LOOK HE HAD FLUNG AT HER AT PARTING ESPECIALLY WHEN HE KNEW THAT THE BABY WAS NOT DANGEROUSLY ILL
5622-41172-0010 LET HIM WEARY OF HER BUT HE WOULD BE HERE WITH HER SO THAT SHE WOULD SEE HIM WOULD KNOW OF EVERY ACTION HE TOOK SHE WAS SITTING IN THE DRAWING ROOM NEAR A LAMP WITH A NEW VOLUME OF TAINE AND AS SHE READ LISTENING TO THE SOUND OF THE WIND OUTSIDE
5622-41172-0011 AND EVERY MINUTE EXPECTING THE CARRIAGE TO ARRIVE SEVERAL TIMES SHE HAD FANCIED SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF WHEELS BUT SHE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN AT LAST SHE HEARD NOT THE SOUND OF WHEELS BUT THE COACHMAN'S SHOUT AND THE DULL RUMBLE IN THE COVERED ENTRY
5622-41172-0012 EVEN PRINCESS VARVARA PLAYING PATIENCE CONFIRMED THIS AND ANNA FLUSHING HOTLY GOT UP BUT INSTEAD OF GOING DOWN AS SHE HAD DONE TWICE BEFORE SHE STOOD STILL SHE SUDDENLY FELT ASHAMED OF HER DUPLICITY
5622-41172-0013 BUT EVEN MORE SHE DREADED HOW HE MIGHT MEET HER ALL FEELING OF WOUNDED PRIDE HAD PASSED NOW SHE WAS ONLY AFRAID OF THE EXPRESSION OF HIS DISPLEASURE SHE REMEMBERED THAT HER CHILD HAD BEEN PERFECTLY WELL AGAIN FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS
5622-41172-0014 SHE FELT POSITIVELY VEXED WITH HER FOR GETTING BETTER FROM THE VERY MOMENT HER LETTER WAS SENT OFF THEN SHE THOUGHT OF HIM THAT HE WAS HERE ALL OF HIM WITH HIS HANDS HIS EYES SHE HEARD HIS VOICE AND FORGETTING EVERYTHING
5622-41172-0015 SHE RAN JOYFULLY TO MEET HIM WELL HOW IS ANNIE HE SAID TIMIDLY FROM BELOW LOOKING UP TO ANNA AS SHE RAN DOWN TO HIM HE WAS SITTING ON A CHAIR AND A FOOTMAN WAS PULLING OFF HIS WARM OVER BOOT
5622-41172-0016 SHE IS BETTER AND YOU HE SAID SHAKING HIMSELF SHE TOOK HIS HAND IN BOTH OF HERS AND DREW IT TO HER WAIST NEVER TAKING HER EYES OFF HIM WELL I'M GLAD HE SAID COLDLY SCANNING HER
5622-41172-0017 AND ARE YOU WELL HE SAID WIPING HIS DAMP BEARD WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND KISSING HER HAND NEVER MIND SHE THOUGHT ONLY LET HIM BE HERE AND SO LONG AS HE'S HERE HE CANNOT HE DARE NOT CEASE TO LOVE ME

5622-41172-0019 WHEN HE'S HERE I NEVER TAKE IT HARDLY EVER HE TOLD HER ABOUT THE ELECTION AND ANNA KNEW HOW BY ADROIT QUESTIONS TO BRING HIM TO WHAT GAVE HIM MOST PLEASURE HIS OWN SUCCESS
5622-41172-0020 SHE TOLD HIM OF EVERYTHING THAT INTERESTED HIM AT HOME AND ALL THAT SHE TOLD HIM WAS OF THE MOST CHEERFUL DESCRIPTION BUT LATE IN THE EVENING WHEN THEY WERE ALONE ANNA SEEING THAT SHE HAD REGAINED COMPLETE POSSESSION OF HIM
5622-41172-0021 SHE SAID TELL ME FRANKLY YOU WERE VEXED AT GETTING MY LETTER AND YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE ME AS SOON AS SHE HAD SAID IT SHE FELT THAT HOWEVER WARM HIS FEELINGS WERE TO HER HE HAD NOT FORGIVEN HER FOR THAT YES HE SAID
