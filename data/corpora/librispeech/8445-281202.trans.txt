8445-281202-0000 ROBINSON CRUSOE IS SHIPWRECKED BY DANIEL DEFOE HAVING LIVED ALMOST FOUR YEARS IN THE BRAZILS AND BEGINNING TO THRIVE AND PROSPER VERY WELL UPON MY PLANTATION I HAD NOT ONLY LEARNED THE LANGUAGE
8445-281202-0001 BUT HAD CONTRACTED ACQUAINTANCE AND FRIENDSHIP AMONG MY FELLOW PLANTERS
8445-281202-0002 WHICH WAS OUR PORT AND IN MY DISCOURSES AMONG THEM I HAD FREQUENTLY GIVEN THEM AN ACCOUNT OF MY TWO VOYAGES TO THE COAST OF GUINEA THE MANNER OF TRADING WITH THE NEGROES THERE
8445-281202-0003 AND HOW EASY IT WAS TO PURCHASE UPON THE COAST FOR TRIFLES SUCH AS BEADS TOYS KNIVES SCISSORS HATCHETS BITS OF GLASS AND THE LIKE NOT ONLY GOLD DUST GUINEA GRAINS ELEPHANTS TEETH ET CETERA
8445-281202-0004 BUT NEGROES FOR THE SERVICE OF THE BRAZILS IN GREAT NUMBERS THEY LISTENED VERY ATTENTIVELY TO MY DISCOURSES ON THESE HEADS BUT ESPECIALLY TO THAT PART WHICH RELATED TO THE BUYING OF NEGROES WHICH WAS A TRADE AT THAT TIME NOT FAR ENTERED INTO
8445-281202-0005 AND TALKING OF THINGS VERY EARNESTLY THREE OF THEM CAME TO ME NEXT MORNING AND TOLD ME THEY HAD BEEN MUSING VERY MUCH UPON WHAT I HAD DISCOURSED WITH THEM OF THE LAST NIGHT AND THEY CAME TO MAKE A SECRET PROPOSAL TO ME
8445-281202-0006 THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD A MIND TO FIT OUT A SHIP TO GO TO GUINEA THAT THEY HAD ALL PLANTATIONS AS WELL AS I AND FOR WHICH THEY NEEDED NOTHING SO MUCH AS SERVANTS THAT AS IT WAS A TRADE THAT COULD NOT BE CARRIED ON BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT PUBLICLY SELL THE NEGROES WHEN THEY CAME HOME
8445-281202-0007 SO THEY DESIRED TO MAKE BUT ONE VOYAGE TO BRING THE NEGROES ON SHORE PRIVATELY AND DIVIDE THEM AMONG THEIR OWN PLANTATIONS AND IN A WORD THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER I WOULD GO TO MANAGE THE TRADING PART UPON THE COAST OF GUINEA
8445-281202-0008 AND THEY OFFERED ME THAT I SHOULD HAVE MY EQUAL SHARE OF THE NEGROES WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY PART OF THE STOCK THIS WAS A FAIR PROPOSAL IT MUST BE CONFESSED HAD IT BEEN MADE TO ANY ONE THAT HAD NOT HAD A SETTLEMENT AND A PLANTATION OF HIS OWN TO LOOK AFTER
8445-281202-0009 BUT FOR ME THAT WAS THUS ENTERED AND ESTABLISHED AND HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO GO ON AS I HAD BEGUN FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS MORE AND TO HAVE SENT FOR THE OTHER HUNDRED POUNDS FROM ENGLAND AND WHO IN THAT TIME AND WITH THAT LITTLE ADDITION
8445-281202-0010 MAKING THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP THAT HAD SAVED MY LIFE AS BEFORE MY UNIVERSAL HEIR BUT OBLIGING HIM TO DISPOSE OF MY EFFECTS AS I HAD DIRECTED IN MY WILL ONE HALF OF THE PRODUCE BEING TO HIMSELF AND THE OTHER TO BE SHIPPED TO ENGLAND
8445-281202-0011 IN SHORT I TOOK ALL POSSIBLE CAUTION TO PRESERVE MY EFFECTS
8445-281202-0012 HAD I USED HALF AS MUCH PRUDENCE TO HAVE LOOKED INTO MY OWN INTEREST AND HAVE MADE A JUDGMENT OF WHAT I OUGHT TO HAVE DONE AND OUGHT NOT TO HAVE DONE I HAD CERTAINLY NEVER GONE AWAY FROM SO PROSPEROUS AN UNDERTAKING AND GONE UPON A VOYAGE TO SEA ATTENDED WITH ALL ITS HAZARDS
8445-281202-0013 BUT I WAS HURRIED ON AND OBEYED BLINDLY THE DICTATES OF MY FANCY RATHER THAN MY REASON AND ACCORDINGLY
8445-281202-0014 AND ALL THINGS DONE AS BY AGREEMENT BY MY PARTNERS IN THE VOYAGE
8445-281202-0015 BEING THE SAME DAY EIGHT YEARS THAT I WENT FROM MY FATHER AND MOTHER AT HULL
8445-281202-0016 CARRIED SIX GUNS AND FOURTEEN MEN BESIDES THE MASTER HIS BOY AND MYSELF WE HAD ON BOARD NO LARGE CARGO OF GOODS EXCEPT OF SUCH TOYS AS WERE FIT FOR OUR TRADE WITH THE NEGROES SUCH AS BEADS BITS OF GLASS SHELLS AND OTHER TRIFLES
8445-281202-0017 ESPECIALLY LITTLE LOOKING GLASSES KNIVES SCISSORS HATCHETS AND THE LIKE THE SAME DAY I WENT ON BOARD WE SET SAIL STANDING AWAY TO THE NORTHWARD UPON OUR OWN COAST
8445-281202-0018 WHEN A VIOLENT TORNADO OR HURRICANE TOOK US QUITE OUT OF OUR KNOWLEDGE IT BLEW IN SUCH A TERRIBLE MANNER THAT FOR TWELVE DAYS TOGETHER WE COULD DO NOTHING BUT DRIVE AND SCUDDING AWAY BEFORE IT
8445-281202-0019 AND DURING THESE TWELVE DAYS I NEED NOT SAY THAT I EXPECTED EVERY DAY TO BE SWALLOWED UP NOR DID ANY IN THE SHIP EXPECT TO SAVE THEIR LIVES IN THIS DISTRESS WE HAD BESIDES THE TERROR OF THE STORM ONE OF OUR MEN DIE OF THE CALENTURE
8445-281202-0020 WEST FROM CAPE SAINT AUGUSTINO SO THAT HE FOUND HE WAS GOTTEN UPON THE COAST OF GUIANA OR THE NORTH PART OF BRAZIL BEYOND THE RIVER AMAZON TOWARD THAT OF THE RIVER ORINOCO COMMONLY CALLED THE GREAT RIVER AND NOW HE BEGAN TO CONSULT WITH ME
8445-281202-0021 WHAT COURSE HE SHOULD TAKE FOR THE SHIP WAS LEAKY AND VERY MUCH DISABLED AND HE WAS FOR GOING DIRECTLY BACK TO THE COAST OF BRAZIL I WAS POSITIVELY AGAINST THAT
8445-281202-0022 WE CONCLUDED THERE WAS NO INHABITED COUNTRY FOR US TO HAVE RECOURSE TO TILL WE CAME WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF THE CARIBBEE ISLANDS
8445-281202-0023 WHEREAS WE COULD NOT POSSIBLY MAKE OUR VOYAGE TO THE COAST OF AFRICA WITHOUT SOME ASSISTANCE BOTH TO OUR SHIP AND TO OURSELVES
8445-281202-0024 IN ORDER TO REACH SOME OF OUR ENGLISH ISLANDS
8445-281202-0025 BUT OUR VOYAGE WAS OTHERWISE DETERMINED FOR BEING IN THE LATITUDE OF TWELVE DEGREES EIGHTEEN MINUTES A SECOND STORM CAME UPON US WHICH CARRIED US AWAY WITH THE SAME IMPETUOSITY WESTWARD AND DROVE US SO OUT OF THE WAY OF ALL HUMAN COMMERCE THAT
8445-281202-0026 AND IN A MOMENT HER MOTION BEING SO STOPPED THE SEA BROKE OVER HER IN SUCH A MANNER THAT WE EXPECTED WE SHOULD ALL HAVE PERISHED IMMEDIATELY AND WE WERE EVEN DRIVEN INTO OUR CLOSE QUARTERS TO SHELTER US FROM THE VERY FOAM AND SPRAY OF THE SEA IT IS NOT EASY FOR ANY ONE
8445-281202-0027 WHO HAS NOT BEEN IN THE LIKE CONDITION TO DESCRIBE OR CONCEIVE THE CONSTERNATION OF MEN IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WE KNEW NOTHING WHERE WE WERE OR UPON WHAT LAND IT WAS WE WERE DRIVEN WHETHER AN ISLAND OR THE MAIN WHETHER INHABITED OR NOT INHABITED
8445-281202-0028 AS THE RAGE OF THE WIND WAS STILL GREAT THOUGH RATHER LESS THAN AT FIRST WE COULD NOT SO MUCH AS HOPE TO HAVE THE SHIP HOLD MANY MINUTES WITHOUT BREAKING IN PIECES UNLESS THE WINDS BY A KIND OF MIRACLE SHOULD TURN IMMEDIATELY ABOUT IN A WORD WE SAT LOOKING ONE UPON ANOTHER
8445-281202-0029 AND EXPECTING DEATH EVERY MOMENT AND EVERY MAN ACTING ACCORDINGLY AS PREPARING FOR ANOTHER WORLD FOR THERE WAS LITTLE OR NOTHING MORE FOR US TO DO IN THIS THAT WHICH WAS OUR PRESENT COMFORT AND ALL THE COMFORT WE HAD WAS THAT CONTRARY TO OUR EXPECTATION
8445-281202-0030 THE SHIP DID NOT BREAK YET AND THAT THE MASTER SAID THE WIND BEGAN TO ABATE NOW THOUGH WE THOUGHT THE WIND DID A LITTLE ABATE YET THE SHIP HAVING THUS STRUCK UPON THE SAND AND STICKING TOO FAST FOR US TO EXPECT HER GETTING OFF
8445-281202-0031 AND IN THE NEXT PLACE SHE BROKE AWAY AND EITHER SUNK OR WAS DRIVEN OFF TO SEA SO THERE WAS NO HOPE FROM HER WE HAD ANOTHER BOAT ON BOARD
8445-281202-0032 HOWEVER THERE WAS NO ROOM TO DEBATE FOR WE FANCIED THE SHIP WOULD BREAK IN PIECES EVERY MINUTE AND SOME TOLD US SHE WAS ACTUALLY BROKEN ALREADY IN THIS DISTRESS THE MATE OF OUR VESSEL
8445-281202-0033 THEY GOT HER FLUNG OVER THE SHIP'S SIDE AND GETTING ALL INTO HER WE LET GO AND COMMITTED OURSELVES BEING ELEVEN IN NUMBER TO GOD'S MERCY AND THE WILD SEA FOR THOUGH THE STORM WAS ABATED CONSIDERABLY
8445-281202-0034 YET THE SEA WENT DREADFULLY HIGH UPON THE SHORE AND MIGHT BE WELL CALLED
8445-281202-0035 AS TO MAKING SAIL WE HAD NONE NOR IF WE HAD COULD WE HAVE DONE ANYTHING WITH IT SO WE WORKED AT THE OAR TOWARD THE LAND THOUGH WITH HEAVY HEARTS LIKE MEN GOING TO EXECUTION FOR WE ALL KNEW THAT WHEN THE BOAT CAME NEAR THE SHORE
8445-281202-0036 SHE WOULD BE DASHED IN A THOUSAND PIECES BY THE BREACH OF THE SEA HOWEVER WE COMMITTED OUR SOULS TO GOD IN THE MOST EARNEST MANNER AND THE WIND DRIVING US TOWARD THE SHORE WE HASTENED OUR DESTRUCTION WITH OUR OWN HANDS
8445-281202-0037 PULLING AS WELL AS WE COULD TOWARD LAND WHAT THE SHORE WAS WHETHER ROCK OR SAND WHETHER STEEP OR SHOAL WE KNEW NOT THE ONLY HOPE THAT COULD RATIONALLY GIVE US THE LEAST SHADOW OF EXPECTATION WAS IF WE MIGHT HAPPEN INTO SOME BAY OR GULF
8445-281202-0038 OR THE MOUTH OF SOME RIVER WHERE BY GREAT CHANCE WE MIGHT HAVE RUN OUR BOAT IN OR GOT UNDER THE LEE OF THE LAND AND PERHAPS MADE SMOOTH WATER BUT THERE WAS NOTHING OF THIS APPEARED BUT AS WE MADE NEARER AND NEARER THE SHORE THE LAND LOOKED MORE FRIGHTFUL THAN THE SEA
8445-281202-0039 AFTER WE HAD ROWED OR RATHER DRIVEN ABOUT A LEAGUE AND A HALF AS WE RECKONED IT A RAGING WAVE MOUNTAIN LIKE CAME ROLLING ASTERN OF US AND PLAINLY BADE US
8445-281202-0040 IN A WORD IT TOOK US WITH SUCH A FURY THAT IT OVERSET THE BOAT AT ONCE AND SEPARATING US AS WELL FROM THE BOAT AS FROM ONE ANOTHER GAVE US NOT TIME HARDLY TO SAY O GOD FOR WE WERE ALL SWALLOWED UP IN A MOMENT
8445-281202-0041 NOTHING CAN DESCRIBE THE CONFUSION OF THOUGHT WHICH I FELT WHEN I SANK INTO THE WATER FOR THOUGH I SWAM VERY WELL YET I COULD NOT DELIVER MYSELF FROM THE WAVES SO AS TO DRAW BREATH TILL THAT WAVE HAVING DRIVEN ME OR RATHER CARRIED ME
8445-281202-0042 WENT BACK AND LEFT ME UPON THE LAND ALMOST DRY BUT HALF DEAD WITH THE WATER I TOOK IN I HAD SO MUCH PRESENCE OF MIND AS WELL AS BREATH LEFT THAT SEEING MYSELF NEARER THE MAINLAND THAN I EXPECTED I GOT UPON MY FEET
8445-281202-0043 AND ENDEAVORED TO MAKE ON TOWARD THE LAND AS FAST AS I COULD
8445-281202-0044 AND AS FURIOUS AS AN ENEMY WHICH I HAD NO MEANS OR STRENGTH TO CONTEND WITH MY BUSINESS WAS TO HOLD MY BREATH AND RAISE MYSELF UPON THE WATER IF I COULD AND SO BY SWIMMING TO PRESERVE MY BREATHING AND PILOT MYSELF TOWARD THE SHORE IF POSSIBLE
8445-281202-0045 MY GREATEST CONCERN NOW BEING THAT THE WAVE AS IT WOULD CARRY ME A GREAT WAY TOWARD THE SHORE WHEN IT CAME ON MIGHT NOT CARRY ME BACK AGAIN WITH IT WHEN IT GAVE BACK TOWARD THE SEA
8445-281202-0046 THE WAVE THAT CAME UPON ME AGAIN BURIED ME AT ONCE TWENTY OR THIRTY FEET DEEP IN ITS OWN BODY AND I COULD FEEL MYSELF CARRIED WITH A MIGHTY FORCE AND SWIFTNESS TOWARD THE SHORE A VERY GREAT WAY BUT I HELD MY BREATH
8445-281202-0047 AND ASSISTED MYSELF TO SWIM STILL FORWARD WITH ALL MY MIGHT I WAS READY TO BURST WITH HOLDING MY BREATH WHEN AS I FELT MYSELF RISING UP SO TO MY IMMEDIATE RELIEF I FOUND MY HEAD AND HANDS SHOOT OUT ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
8445-281202-0048 GAVE ME BREATH AND NEW COURAGE I WAS COVERED AGAIN WITH WATER A GOOD WHILE BUT NOT SO LONG BUT I HELD IT OUT AND FINDING THE WATER HAD SPENT ITSELF
8445-281202-0049 AND TILL THE WATERS WENT FROM ME AND THEN TOOK TO MY HEELS AND RAN WITH WHAT STRENGTH I HAD FARTHER TOWARD THE SHORE BUT NEITHER WOULD THIS DELIVER ME FROM THE FURY OF THE SEA WHICH CAME POURING IN AFTER ME AGAIN
8445-281202-0050 AND TWICE MORE I WAS LIFTED UP BY THE WAVES AND CARRIED FORWARD AS BEFORE
8445-281202-0051 FOR THE SEA HAVING HURRIED ME ALONG AS BEFORE
8445-281202-0052 AGAINST A PIECE OF A ROCK AND THAT WITH SUCH FORCE AS IT LEFT ME SENSELESS AND INDEED HELPLESS AS TO MY OWN DELIVERANCE FOR THE BLOW TAKING MY SIDE AND BREAST BEAT THE BREATH AS IT WERE QUITE OUT OF MY BODY AND HAD IT RETURNED AGAIN IMMEDIATELY
8445-281202-0053 BUT I RECOVERED A LITTLE BEFORE THE RETURN OF THE WAVES AND SEEING I SHOULD BE COVERED AGAIN WITH WATER
8445-281202-0054 AND SO TO HOLD MY BREATH IF POSSIBLE TILL THE WAVE WENT BACK NOW AS THE WAVES WERE NOT SO HIGH AS AT FIRST BEING NEARER LAND
8445-281202-0055 THAT THE NEXT WAVE THOUGH IT WENT OVER ME
8445-281202-0056 I GOT TO THE MAINLAND WHERE TO MY GREAT COMFORT I CLAMBERED UP THE CLIFTS AND SAT UPON THE GRASS FREE FROM DANGER AND QUITE OUT OF THE REACH OF THE WATER I WAS NOW LANDED AND SAFE ON SHORE AND BEGAN TO LOOK UP AND THANK GOD THAT MY LIFE WAS SAVED
8445-281202-0057 IN A CASE WHEREIN THERE WAS SOME MINUTES BEFORE SCARCE ANY ROOM TO HOPE I BELIEVE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPRESS TO THE LIFE WHAT THE ECSTASIES AND TRANSPORTS OF THE SOUL ARE WHEN IT IS SO SAVED
8445-281202-0058 AS I MAY SAY OUT OF THE VERY GRAVE AND I DO NOT WONDER NOW AT THAT CUSTOM WHEN A MALEFACTOR WHO HAS THE HALTER ABOUT HIS NECK IS TIED UP AND JUST GOING TO BE TURNED OFF AND HAS A REPRIEVE BROUGHT TO HIM
8445-281202-0059 TO LET HIM BLEED THAT VERY MOMENT THEY TELL HIM OF IT THAT THE SURPRISE MAY NOT DRIVE THE ANIMAL SPIRITS FROM THE HEART AND OVERWHELM HIM FOR SUDDEN JOYS LIKE GRIEFS CONFOUND AT FIRST I WALKED ABOUT ON THE SHORE LIFTING UP MY HANDS
8445-281202-0060 AND MY WHOLE BEING AS I MAY SAY
8445-281202-0061 MAKING A THOUSAND GESTURES AND MOTIONS WHICH I CANNOT DESCRIBE REFLECTING UPON ALL MY COMRADES THAT WERE DROWNED AND THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE ONE SOUL SAVED BUT MYSELF FOR AS FOR THEM I NEVER SAW THEM AFTERWARD OR ANY SIGN OF THEM
8445-281202-0062 EXCEPT THREE OF THEIR HATS ONE CAP AND TWO SHOES THAT WERE NOT FELLOWS I CAST MY EYES TO THE STRANDED VESSEL WHEN THE BREACH AND FROTH OF THE SEA BEING SO BIG I COULD HARDLY SEE IT IT LAY SO FAR OFF AND CONSIDERED LORD
8445-281202-0063 HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE I COULD GET ON SHORE AFTER I HAD SOLACED MY MIND WITH THE COMFORTABLE PART OF MY CONDITION I BEGAN TO LOOK ROUND ME TO SEE WHAT KIND OF PLACE I WAS IN
8445-281202-0064 AND THAT IN A WORD I HAD A DREADFUL DELIVERANCE FOR I WAS WET HAD NO CLOTHES TO SHIFT ME NOR ANYTHING EITHER TO EAT OR DRINK TO COMFORT ME NEITHER DID I SEE ANY PROSPECT BEFORE ME BUT THAT OF PERISHING WITH HUNGER
8445-281202-0065 OR BEING DEVOURED BY WILD BEASTS AND THAT WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY AFFLICTING TO ME WAS THAT I HAD NO WEAPON
8445-281202-0066 IN A WORD I HAD NOTHING ABOUT ME BUT A KNIFE A TOBACCO PIPE AND A LITTLE TOBACCO IN A BOX THIS WAS ALL MY PROVISION AND THIS THREW ME INTO TERRIBLE AGONIES OF MIND THAT FOR A WHILE I RAN ABOUT LIKE A MADMAN
8445-281202-0067 NIGHT COMING UPON ME I BEGAN WITH A HEAVY HEART TO CONSIDER WHAT WOULD BE MY LOT IF THERE WERE ANY RAVENOUS BEASTS IN THAT COUNTRY SEEING AT NIGHT THEY ALWAYS COME ABROAD FOR THEIR PREY ALL THE REMEDY THAT OFFERED TO MY THOUGHTS AT THAT TIME
8445-281202-0068 WAS TO GET UP INTO A THICK BUSHY TREE LIKE A FIR BUT THORNY WHICH GREW NEAR ME AND WHERE I RESOLVED TO SIT ALL NIGHT AND CONSIDER THE NEXT DAY WHAT DEATH I SHOULD DIE
8445-281202-0069 I WENT TO THE TREE AND GETTING UP INTO IT ENDEAVORED TO PLACE MYSELF SO THAT IF I SHOULD SLEEP I MIGHT NOT FALL AND HAVING CUT ME A SHORT STICK LIKE A TRUNCHEON FOR MY DEFENCE I TOOK UP MY LODGING AND BEING EXCESSIVELY FATIGUED
8445-281202-0070 I FELL FAST ASLEEP AND SLEPT AS COMFORTABLY AS I BELIEVE FEW COULD HAVE DONE IN MY CONDITION
