7786-118693-0000 AT LAST HE CAME ACROSS TRACES OF HUMAN EXISTENCE
7786-118693-0001 NEITHER COTTAGE ROOFS NOR SMOKE THOUGH IT WAS SUCH A CLEAR DAY THAT THE STREAMLETS WHICH RAN BETWEEN THE HILLOCKS SHONE BRIGHTLY AND DAZZLED HIS EYES
7786-118693-0002 WHICH WERE ACCUSTOMED TO THE DARKNESS OF THE FOREST BUT YET THE DISTRICT SEEMED TO BE INHABITED A FIRM YELLOW ROAD WOUND IN A BROAD SEMICIRCLE ROUND THE MOOR
7786-118693-0003 THE RUTS LEFT BY THE CART WHEELS OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR CROSSED EACH OTHER DISTINCTLY BUT NO NEW WHEELS HAD GROUND THE DRY CLODS OF EARTH INTO DUST PROBABLY THE ROAD WAS SELDOM USED
7786-118693-0004 AT ANY RATE THE FUGITIVE SAT FOR HOURS IN HIS TREE WITHOUT HEARING IN THE DISTANCE THE CREAKING OF THE UNGREASED AXLE OF A PEASANT'S CART FROM THE ROAD THERE BRANCHED OFF A PATH WHICH SEEMED TO LEAD TO A DISTANT VILLAGE
7786-118693-0005 AND BEGAN TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE COULD VENTURE INTO A VILLAGE TO BUY BREAD IN THE POCKET OF THE MURDERED HUNTSMAN HE HAD FOUND A ROUBLE NOTE AND SOME SILVER COINS IT WAS TRUE THAT HIS HAIR HAD NOT GROWN AGAIN THE NORMAL LENGTH
7786-118693-0006 BUT HE COULD TIE A PIECE OF CLOTH ROUND HIS HALF SHORN SKULL AND NEED NOT TAKE IT OFF WHEN HE ENTERED A SHOP
7786-118693-0007 HE SAID TO RE ASSURE HIMSELF FOR HE FELT A NERVOUS ANTIPATHY TO MEETING ANY ONE JUST AS A WOLF FEARS EVERY YELPING CUR AS SOON AS HE WANDERS BY MISTAKE INTO A VILLAGE
7786-118693-0008 AT LAST HE DETERMINED TO GO ON QUITE SLOWLY SO AS TO REACH THE VILLAGE UNDER COVER OF THE APPROACHING DARKNESS WITH THIS IDEA HE TURNED INTO THE PATH WHICH WOUND IN AN ECCENTRIC FASHION THROUGH THE MOOR
7786-118693-0009 SOMETIMES DIVING INTO RAVINES AND SOMETIMES EMERGING INTO CLEAR SUNSHINE HERE AND THERE STUMPS OF TREES BEARING THE FRESH MARKS OF AN AXE AND BLACK ABANDONED FIRE PLACES WHOSE ASHES HAD NOT YET BEEN QUITE BLOWN AWAY
7786-118693-0010 SHOWED THAT MEN HAD WORKED AND RESTED HERE THE WANDERER ALSO THOUGHT HE OFTEN HEARD HUMAN VOICES BUT WHEN HE HELD HIS BREATH TO LISTEN HE ALWAYS FOUND IT HAD BEEN THE DECEPTIVE CRY OF A BIRD
7786-118693-0011 THE DAY CAME TO AN END THE GOLDEN RADIANCE OF THE SUN SETTING BEHIND THE DISTANT HILLS GREW PALE AND THE FIRST STARS GLIMMERED IN THE DUSKY SKY
7786-118693-0012 IVAN STRODE VALIANTLY FORWARDS THROUGH THE WHITE RISING MISTS OUT OF WHICH SINGLE BRANCHES OF TREES PROJECTING BECKONED TO HIM LIKE LONG LEAN ARMS TILL HE REACHED A COPSE WITH DRY MOSSY GROUND
7786-118693-0013 WHICH SEEMED ADMIRABLY ADAPTED TO FURNISH HIM WITH A SLEEPING PLACE FOR THE NIGHT HE COLLECTED A BUNDLE OF TWIGS TOGETHER AND STRUCK A LIGHT BUT IN THE ACT OF RAISING HIS HAND HE STOPPED WHAT WAS THAT
7786-118693-0014 WAS THERE NOT A SOUND FROM THE WOOD LIKE A CHILD'S CRYING FOR A MOMENT A COLD THRILL PASSED THROUGH HIM HALF FORGOTTEN GHOST STORIES OCCURRED TO HIM BUT HE WAS TOO INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH THE LIFE OF THE FOREST TO BE SERIOUSLY ALARMED
7786-118693-0015 HULLO WHO IS THERE IS THERE ANY ONE IVAN SHOUTED AS LOUD AS HE COULD HIS VOICE AROUSED THE SLEEPING WOOD SQUIRRELS RUSTLED AMONG THE BRANCHES AND STARTLED BIRDS FLAPPED THEIR WINGS
7786-118693-0016 THEN EVERYTHING WAS AGAIN PERFECTLY SILENT NOR COULD THE SOUND OF CRYING BE HEARD ANY MORE IVAN AGAIN TURNED INTO THE PATH IT MUST BE A WOMAN OR A CHILD HE THOUGHT AND QUITE CLOSE TOO
7786-118693-0017 HE PEERED WITH KEEN EYES THROUGH THE DARKNESS AND MOVED NOISELESSLY FORWARD IN ORDER NOT TO FRIGHTEN THE WEEPER NOW HE HEARD THE SOUND OF SOBBING MORE DISTINCTLY IT WAS A CHILD BUT HOW HAD A CHILD GOT HERE
7786-118693-0018 THE MOON HAD RISEN AND THREW AN UNCERTAIN LIGHT ON THE PATH IN A DITCH BY THE SIDE OF IT LAY SOMETHING WHITE IT WAS THE SKELETON OF A HORSE WHICH HAD BEEN DEVOURED BY WOLVES NEAR IT WAS RUSTLING SOME CREATURE WHICH MOVED OFF AT THE CONVICT'S APPROACH
7786-118693-0019 WHO IS THERE A LOW SOB WAS THE ONLY ANSWER OH I AM FRIGHTENED MOTHER MOTHER THE MOON NOW SHOWED DISTINCTLY A LITTLE CLEARING IN THE WOOD AT THE EDGE OF IT LAY A WOMAN'S FIGURE STRETCHED OUT AT FULL LENGTH
7786-118693-0020 THE WIDE OPEN EYES STARED FIXEDLY AT THE SKY NO BREATH MOVED THE RAGS WHICH COVERED HER BREAST FROM UNDER HER WRETCHED DRESS PROJECTED THE LEAN WAY WORN FEET NEAR HER LAY A WALLET
7786-118693-0021 ASKED THE OLD MAN IN A HOARSE VOICE OH I AM SO FRIGHTENED SO FRIGHTENED SOBBED THE CHILD A LITTLE RAGGED GIRL LIFTED HER PALE FACE TO THE CONVICT AND THEN SEIZED WITH ALARM TRIED TO HIDE HERSELF AGAIN IN HER MOTHER'S CLOTHING
7786-118693-0022 IVAN TOUCHED THE WOMAN'S ICE COLD FOREHEAD
7786-118693-0023 WHISPERED THE CHILD WITHOUT LETTING GO OF THE BODY HAVE YOU BEEN HERE LONG I DO NOT KNOW OH I AM SO FRIGHTENED WAS THE SUN STILL HIGH WHEN YOUR MOTHER FELL DOWN YES GRANDFATHER
7786-118693-0024 IVAN STEPPED TO ONE SIDE AND PILED UP A HEAP OF DRY TWIGS WHICH HE SET ON FIRE THE MERRY FLAMES LICKED WITH RED TONGUES AT THE BRANCHES
7786-118693-0025 SAID THE OLD MAN SPEAKING AS ABRUPTLY AS BEFORE TO THE CHILD DO IT QUICKLY AND MOTHER LET MOTHER REST SHE IS ASLEEP THE FIRE LIGHT PLAYED ON THE FACE OF THE DEAD WOMAN AND LENT IT A GHOSTLY SEMBLANCE OF LIFE
7786-118693-0026 PERHAPS THE RAPIDLY INCREASING DARKNESS ALARMED HER FOR SHE CAME NEARER WITHOUT HIS OBSERVING IT SUDDENLY WITH HER LITTLE HAND SHE SEIZED HIS FINGER AND HELD IT FAST WELL LITTLE THING WHAT DO YOU WANT
7786-118693-0027 HE GROWLED INVOLUNTARILY LAYING HIS FREE HAND ON HER HEAD
