7705-101580-0000 CHAPTER THIRTEEN I'LL STAY ALWAYS FOR A LONG TIME THURSTON LAY WITH WIDE OPEN EYES STARING UP AT NOTHING LISTENING TO THE RAIN AND THINKING
7705-101580-0001 BY AND BY THE RAIN CEASED AND HE COULD TELL BY THE DIM WHITENESS OF THE TENT ROOF THAT THE CLOUDS MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY FROM BEFORE THE MOON THEN JUST PAST THE FULL HE GOT UP CAREFULLY SO AS NOT TO DISTURB THE OTHERS AND
7705-101580-0002 CREPT OVER TWO OR THREE SLEEPING FORMS ON HIS WAY TO THE OPENING UNTIED THE FLAP AND WENT OUT THE WHOLE HILLTOP AND THE VALLEY BELOW WERE BATHED IN MELLOW RADIANCE
7705-101580-0003 HE STUDIED CRITICALLY THE WIDE SWEEP OF THE RIVER HE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE THOUGHT IT THE MISSOURI ITSELF IT STRETCHED SO FAR FROM BANK TO BANK INDEED IT SEEMED TO KNOW NO BANKS BUT THE HILLS THEMSELVES
7705-101580-0004 THE HAND OF PARK RESTED UPON HIS SHOULDER LOOKS KINDA DUBIOUS DON'T IT KID WAS YUH THINKING ABOUT RIDING DOWN THERE YES THURSTON ANSWERED SIMPLY
7705-101580-0005 ARE YOU COMING SURE PARK ASSENTED THEY GOT UPON THEIR HORSES AND HEADED DOWN THE TRAIL TO THE STEVENS PLACE THURSTON WOULD HAVE PUT SUNFISH TO A RUN BUT PARK CHECKED HIM
7705-101580-0006 GO EASY HE ADMONISHED IF THERE'S SWIMMING TO BE DONE AND IT'S A CINCH THERE WILL BE HE'S GOING TO NEED ALL THE WIND HE'S GOT
7705-101580-0007 DOWN THE HILL THEY STOPPED AT THE EDGE OF A RAGING TORRENT AND STRAINED THEIR EYES TO SEE WHAT LAY ON THE OTHER SIDE WHILE THEY LOOKED A LIGHT TWINKLED OUT FROM AMONG THE TREE TOPS THURSTON CAUGHT HIS BREATH SHARPLY
7705-101580-0008 SHE'S UPSTAIRS HE SAID AND HIS VOICE SOUNDED STRAINED AND UNNATURAL IT'S JUST A LOFT WHERE THEY STORE STUFF HE STARTED TO RIDE INTO THE FLOOD
7705-101580-0009 PARK ROARED GET OFF AND LOOSEN THE CINCH BEFORE YUH GO IN THERE OR YUH WON'T GET FAR SUNFISH'LL NEED ROOM TO BREATHE ONCE HE GETS TO BUCKING THAT CURRENT HE'S A GOOD WATER HORSE JUST GIVE HIM HIS HEAD AND DON'T GET RATTLED AND INTERFERE WITH HIM
7705-101580-0010 AND SAT THERE SWAYING DRUNKENLY UPON IT A GREAT YELLOW CAT CLUNG AND YOWLED HIS FEAR THAT'S OLD DUTCH HENRY'S HOUSE PARK SHOUTED ABOVE THE ROAR
7705-101580-0011 SUNFISH HAD CARRIED HIM SAFELY OUT OF THE STAMPEDE AND HE HAD NO FEAR OF HIM NOW HIS CHIEF THOUGHT WAS A WISH THAT HE MIGHT DO THIS THING QUITE ALONE HE WAS JEALOUS OF PARK'S LEADING AND THOUGHT BITTERLY THAT MONA WOULD THANK PARK ALONE
7705-101580-0012 ASHAMED OF WHAT IT HAD DONE THURSTON IN THAT INSTANT CAME NEAR JERKING SUNFISH AROUND TO FOLLOW BUT HE CHECKED THE IMPULSE AS IT WAS FORMED AND LEFT THE REINS ALONE WHICH WAS WISE
7705-101580-0013 ANSWERED FAINTLY FROM THE LOFT HE SHOUTED AGAIN GIVING DIRECTIONS IN A TONE OF AUTHORITY WHICH MUST HAVE SOUNDED STRANGE TO HER BUT WHICH SHE DID NOT SEEM TO RESENT AND OBEYED WITHOUT PROTEST
7705-101580-0014 YOU DIDN'T COPE WITH THE SITUATION AFTER ALL HE REMARKED WHILE SHE WAS SETTLING HERSELF FIRMLY IN THE SADDLE I WENT TO SLEEP AND DIDN'T NOTICE THE WATER TILL IT WAS COMING IN AT THE DOOR SHE EXPLAINED
7705-101580-0015 AND THEN SHE STOPPED ABRUPTLY THEN WHAT HE DEMANDED MALICIOUSLY WERE YOU AFRAID A LITTLE SHE CONFESSED RELUCTANTLY
7705-101580-0016 THURSTON GLOATED OVER IT IN SILENCE UNTIL HE REMEMBERED PARK AFTER THAT HE COULD THINK OF LITTLE ELSE AS BEFORE NOW SUNFISH BATTLED AS SEEMED TO HIM BEST FOR THURSTON ASTRIDE BEHIND THE SADDLE
7705-101580-0017 HELD MONA SOMEWHAT TIGHTER THAN HE NEED TO HAVE DONE AND LET THE HORSE GO SO LONG AS SUNFISH HAD FOOTING HE BRACED HIMSELF AGAINST THE MAD RUSH OF WATERS AND FORGED AHEAD
7705-101580-0018 BUT OUT WHERE THE CURRENT RAN SWIMMING DEEP HE FLOUNDERED DESPERATELY UNDER HIS DOUBLE BURDEN WHILE HIS STRENGTH LASTED HE KEPT HIS HEAD ABOVE WATER STRUGGLING GAMELY AGAINST THE FLOOD THAT LAPPED OVER HIS BACK AND BUBBLED IN HIS NOSTRILS
7705-101580-0019 THURSTON FELT HIS LABORING AND CLUTCHED MONA STILL TIGHTER OF A SUDDEN THE HORSE'S HEAD WENT UNDER THE BLACK WATER CAME UP AROUND THURSTON'S THROAT WITH A HUNGRY SWISH AND SUNFISH WENT OUT FROM UNDER HIM LIKE AN EEL
7705-101580-0020 THERE WAS A CONFUSED ROARING IN HIS EARS A HORRID SENSE OF SUFFOCATION FOR A MOMENT BUT HE HAD LEARNED TO SWIM WHEN HE WAS A BOY AT SCHOOL AND HE FREED ONE HAND FROM ITS GRIP ON MONA AND SET TO PADDLING WITH MUCH VIGOR AND CONSIDERABLY LESS SKILL
7705-101580-0021 AND THOUGH THE UNDER CURRENT CLUTCHED HIM AND THE WEIGHT OF MONA TAXED HIS STRENGTH HE MANAGED TO KEEP THEM BOTH AFLOAT AND TO MAKE A LITTLE HEADWAY UNTIL THE DEEPEST PART LAY BEHIND THEM HOW THANKFUL HE WAS WHEN HIS FEET TOUCHED BOTTOM
7705-101580-0022 NO ONE BUT HIMSELF EVER KNEW HIS EARS HUMMED FROM THE WATER IN THEM AND THE ROAR OF THE RIVER WAS TO HIM AS THE ROAR OF THE SEA HIS EYES SMARTED FROM THE CLAMMY TOUCH OF THE DINGY FROTH THAT WENT HURRYING BY IN MONSTER FLAKES
7705-101580-0023 COUGHED HIS VOICE CLEAR PARK WENT DOWN HE BEGAN HARDLY KNOWING WHAT IT WAS HE WAS SAYING PARK HE STOPPED THEN SHOUTED THE NAME ALOUD PARK
7705-101580-0024 AND FROM SOMEWHERE DOWN THE RIVER CAME A FAINT REASSURING WHOOP THANK THE LORD GASPED THURSTON AND LEANED AGAINST HER FOR A SECOND THEN HE STRAIGHTENED ARE YOU ALL RIGHT HE ASKED
7705-101580-0025 AND DREW HER TOWARD A ROCK NEAR AT HAND FOR IN TRUTH THE KNEES OF HIM WERE SHAKING THEY SAT DOWN AND HE LOOKED MORE CLOSELY AT HER FACE AND DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS WET WITH SOMETHING MORE THAN RIVER WATER
7705-101580-0026 MONA THE SELF ASSURED MONA THE STRONG HEARTED WAS CRYING AND INSTINCTIVELY HE KNEW THAT NOT THE CHILL ALONE MADE HER SHIVER HE WAS KEEPING HIS ARM AROUND HER WAIST DELIBERATELY AND IT PLEASED HIM THAT SHE LET IT STAY
7705-101580-0027 HE LAID A HAND TENDERLY AGAINST HER CHEEK AND WONDERED IF HE DARED FEEL SO HAPPY LITTLE GIRL OH LITTLE GIRL HE SAID SOFTLY AND STOPPED
7705-101580-0028 FOR THE CROWDING EMOTIONS IN HIS HEART AND BRAIN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE HAS NO WORDS MONA LIFTED HER FACE AND LOOKED INTO HIS EYES HER OWN WERE SOFT AND SHINING IN THE MOONLIGHT AND SHE WAS SMILING A LITTLE
7705-101580-0029 THE ROGUISH LITTLE SMILE OF THE IMITATION PASTEL PORTRAIT YOU YOU'LL UNPACK YOUR TYPEWRITER WON'T YOU PLEASE AND AND STAY
7705-101580-0030 THE RANGE LAND WILL NEVER GET RID OF ME NOW HE CRIED JUBILANTLY HANK WANTED TO TAKE ME INTO THE LAZY EIGHT SO NOW I'LL BUY AN INTEREST AND STAY ALWAYS YOU DEAR MONA SNUGGLED CLOSE AND LEARNED HOW IT FEELS TO BE KISSED
7705-101580-0031 IF SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE SUNFISH HAVING SCRAMBLED ASHORE A FEW YARDS FARTHER DOWN CAME UP TO THEM AND STOOD WAITING AS IF TO BE FORGIVEN FOR HIS FAILURE TO CARRY THEM SAFE TO LAND
7705-101580-0032 THURSTON TURNED JOYFULLY TOWARD HIM PARK OLD FELLOW I WAS AFRAID YUH BETTER REFORM AND QUIT BEING AFRAID PARK BANTERED I GOT OUT UH THE MIX UP FINE BUT I GUESS MY HORSE WENT ON DOWN POOR DEVIL
7705-101580-0033 WELL MONA
7705-101580-0034 HE LAUGHED IN HIS TEASING WAY MONA STOOD UP AND HER SHINING EYES WERE TURNED TO THURSTON I DON'T CARE SHE ASSERTED WITH REDDENED CHEEKS I'M JUST GLAD IT DID GET THROUGH
7705-101580-0035 SAME HERE SAID THURSTON WITH MUCH EMPHASIS THEN WITH MONA ONCE MORE IN THE SADDLE AND WITH THURSTON LEADING SUNFISH BY THE BRIDLE REIN
