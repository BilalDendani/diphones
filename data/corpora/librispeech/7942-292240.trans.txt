7942-292240-0000 I CAN REPEAT OVER TO MEN AND WOMEN YOU HAVE DONE SUCH GOOD TO ME I WOULD DO THE SAME TO YOU I WILL RECRUIT FOR MYSELF AND YOU AS I GO
7942-292240-0001 WROTE IT WITH HIS TONGUE IN HIS CHEEK A DASH OF VITRIOL IN THE INK AND WITH A PEN THAT SCRATCHED AND THE FIRST CRITIC WHO SEEMED TO PLACE A JUST ESTIMATE ON THE WORK WAS MISTER ZANGWILL HE WHO HAS NO CHRISTIAN NAME
7942-292240-0002 WRIT DE LUNATICO INQUIRENDO AGAINST HIS JEWISH BROTHER ON THE GROUND THAT THE FIRST SYMPTOM OF INSANITY IS OFTEN THE DELUSION THAT OTHERS ARE INSANE AND THIS BEING SO
7942-292240-0003 WAS NOT A SAFE SUBJECT TO BE AT LARGE
7942-292240-0004 FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS NO WONDER IS IT THAT WITH POCKETS FULL TO BURSTING
7942-292240-0005 WHENEVER HE THINKS OF HOW HE HAS WORKED THE WORLD IF DOCTOR TALMAGE IS THE BARNUM OF THEOLOGY SURELY WE MAY CALL
7942-292240-0006 SEEMINGLY WRITTEN IN COLLABORATION WITH JULES VERNE AND MARK TWAIN WOULD BE CHEAP FOR A DOLLAR BUT WHAT I OBJECT TO IS PROFESSOR HERMANN'S DISCIPLES POSING AS SURE ENOUGH MATERIALIZING MEDIUMS
7942-292240-0007 AND PROFESSOR LOMBROSO'S FOLLOWERS CALLING THEMSELVES SCIENTISTS WHEN EACH GOES FORTH WITHOUT SCRIP OR PURSE WITH NO OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO SUPPLY THEMSELVES WITH BOTH
7942-292240-0008 YET IT WAS BARNUM HIMSELF WHO SAID THAT THE PUBLIC DELIGHTS IN BEING HUMBUGGED
7942-292240-0009 WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE PRIVILEGE NORDAU'S SUCCESS HINGED ON HIS AUDACIOUS ASSUMPTION THAT THE PUBLIC KNEW NOTHING OF THE LAW OF ANTITHESIS YET PLATO EXPLAINED THAT THE OPPOSITES OF THINGS LOOK ALIKE
7942-292240-0010 AND SOMETIMES ARE ALIKE AND THAT WAS QUITE A WHILE AGO THE MULTITUDE ANSWERED THOU HAST A DEVIL MANY OF THEM SAID HE HATH A DEVIL AND IS MAD FESTUS SAID WITH A LOUD VOICE
7942-292240-0011 MORE THROATY THAN THAT OF FESTUS MAD WHITMAN WAS MAD BEYOND THE CAVIL OF A DOUBT IN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SIXTY TWO LINCOLN LOOKING OUT OF A WINDOW
7942-292240-0012 BEFORE LILACS LAST IN THE DOORYARD BLOOMED ON ONE OF THE STREETS OF WASHINGTON SAW A WORKINGMAN IN SHIRT SLEEVES GO BY TURNING TO A FRIEND THE PRESIDENT SAID THERE GOES A MAN
7942-292240-0013 LINCOLN IN HIS EARLY DAYS WAS A WORKINGMAN AND AN ATHLETE AND HE NEVER QUITE GOT THE IDEA OUT OF HIS HEAD AND I AM GLAD THAT HE WAS STILL A HEWER OF WOOD
7942-292240-0014 HE ONCE TOLD GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS THAT HE MORE THAN HALF EXPECTED YET TO GO BACK TO THE FARM AND EARN HIS DAILY BREAD BY THE WORK THAT HIS HANDS FOUND TO DO HE DREAMED OF IT NIGHTS
7942-292240-0015 AND WHENEVER HE SAW A SPLENDID TOILER HE FELT LIKE HAILING THE MAN AS BROTHER AND STRIKING HANDS WITH HIM WHEN LINCOLN SAW WHITMAN STROLLING MAJESTICALLY PAST HE TOOK HIM FOR A STEVEDORE
7942-292240-0016 OR POSSIBLY THE FOREMAN OF A CONSTRUCTION GANG WHITMAN WAS FIFTY ONE YEARS OLD THEN HIS LONG FLOWING BEARD WAS SNOW WHITE AND THE SHOCK THAT COVERED HIS JOVE LIKE HEAD WAS IRON GRAY
7942-292240-0017 HIS FORM WAS THAT OF AN APOLLO WHO HAD ARRIVED AT YEARS OF DISCRETION HE WEIGHED AN EVEN TWO HUNDRED POUNDS AND WAS JUST SIX FEET HIGH HIS PLAIN CHECK COTTON SHIRT WAS OPEN AT THE THROAT TO THE BREAST
7942-292240-0018 WHITMAN USED NO TOBACCO NEITHER DID HE APPLY HOT AND REBELLIOUS LIQUORS TO HIS BLOOD AND WITH UNBLUSHING FOREHEAD WOO THE MEANS OF DEBILITY AND DISEASE UP TO HIS FIFTY THIRD YEAR HE HAD NEVER KNOWN A SICK DAY
7942-292240-0019 ALTHOUGH AT THIRTY HIS HAIR HAD BEGUN TO WHITEN HE HAD THE LOOK OF AGE IN HIS YOUTH AND THE LOOK OF YOUTH IN HIS AGE THAT OFTEN MARKS THE EXCEPTIONAL MAN BUT AT FIFTY THREE HIS SPLENDID HEALTH WAS CROWDED TO THE BREAKING STRAIN
7942-292240-0020 HOW THROUGH CARING FOR WOUNDED SICK AND DYING MEN
7942-292240-0021 DAY AFTER DAY THROUGH THE LONG SILENT WATCHES OF THE NIGHT FROM EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR TO THE DAY OF HIS DEATH IN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED NINETY TWO HE WAS PHYSICALLY A MAN IN RUINS
7942-292240-0022 BUT HE DID NOT WITHER AT THE TOP THROUGH IT ALL HE HELD THE HEALTHY OPTIMISM OF BOYHOOD CARRYING WITH HIM THE PERFUME OF THE MORNING AND THE LAVISH HEART OF YOUTH DOCTOR BUCKE WHO WAS SUPERINTENDENT
7942-292240-0023 OF A HOSPITAL FOR THE INSANE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND THE INTIMATE FRIEND OF WHITMAN ALL THE TIME HAS SAID HIS BUILD HIS STATURE HIS EXCEPTIONAL HEALTH OF MIND AND BODY
7942-292240-0024 THE SIZE AND FORM OF HIS FEATURES HIS CLEANLINESS OF MIND AND BODY THE GRACE OF HIS MOVEMENTS AND GESTURES THE GRANDEUR AND ESPECIALLY THE MAGNETISM OF HIS PRESENCE THE CHARM OF HIS VOICE
7942-292240-0025 HIS ENTIRE UNRESENTFULNESS UNDER WHATEVER PROVOCATION HIS LIBERALITY HIS UNIVERSAL SYMPATHY WITH HUMANITY IN ALL AGES AND LANDS HIS BROAD TOLERANCE HIS CATHOLIC FRIENDLINESS
7942-292240-0026 HE HAD NO QUARREL WITH THE WORLD AND HE DID NOT WAX RICH ONE THING THOU LACKEST O WALT WHITMAN WE MIGHT HAVE SAID TO THE POET YOU ARE NOT A FINANCIER HE DIED POOR
7942-292240-0027 SAVE ON CHANGE WHEN THE CHILDREN OF COUNT TOLSTOY ENDEAVORED TO HAVE HIM ADJUDGED INSANE
7942-292240-0028 A MAN WHO GIVES AWAY HIS MONEY IS NOT NECESSARILY MORE FOOLISH THAN HE WHO SAVES IT AND WITH HORACE L TRAUBEL I ASSERT THAT WHITMAN WAS THE SANEST MAN I EVER SAW
7942-292240-0029 THERE WAS A QUALITY IN THE MAN PECULIARLY UNIVERSAL A STRONG VIRILE POISE THAT ASKED FOR NOTHING BUT TOOK WHAT IT NEEDED HE LOVED MEN AS BROTHERS YET HIS BROTHERS AFTER THE FLESH
7942-292240-0030 UNDERSTOOD HIM NOT HE LOVED CHILDREN THEY TURNED TO HIM INSTINCTIVELY BUT HE HAD NO CHILDREN OF HIS OWN HE LOVED WOMEN AND YET THIS STRONGLY SEXED AND MANLY MAN NEVER LOVED A WOMAN
7942-292240-0031 AND I MIGHT HERE SAY AS PHILIP GILBERT HAMERTON SAID OF TURNER HE WAS LAMENTABLY UNFORTUNATE IN THIS THROUGHOUT HIS WHOLE LIFE HE NEVER CAME UNDER THE ENNOBLING AND REFINING INFLUENCE
7942-292240-0032 ALL THE TENDER SENTIMENTALITY WE THROW AROUND A PLACE IS THE RESULT OF THE SACRED THOUGHT THAT WE LIVE THERE WITH SOME ONE ELSE IT IS
7942-292240-0033 THE HOME IS A TRYST THE PLACE WHERE WE RETIRE AND SHUT THE WORLD OUT LOVERS MAKE A HOME JUST AS BIRDS MAKE A NEST AND UNLESS A MAN KNOWS THE SPELL OF THE DIVINE PASSION
7942-292240-0034 I HARDLY SEE HOW HE CAN HAVE A HOME AT ALL HE ONLY RENTS A ROOM CAMDEN IS SEPARATED FROM THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA BY THE DELAWARE RIVER CAMDEN LIES LOW AND FLAT
7942-292240-0035 A GREAT SANDY MONOTONOUS WASTE OF STRAGGLING BUILDINGS HERE AND THERE ARE STRAIGHT ROWS OF CHEAP HOUSES EVIDENTLY ERECTED BY STAID BROAD BRIMMED SPECULATORS FROM ACROSS THE RIVER
7942-292240-0036 WITH EYES ON THE MAIN CHANCE BUT THEY RECKONED ILL
7942-292240-0037 SOME OF THESE HOUSES HAVE MARBLE STEPS AND WHITE BARN LIKE SHUTTERS THAT MIGHT WITHSTAND A SIEGE WHEN A FUNERAL TAKES PLACE IN ONE OF THESE HOUSES THE SHUTTERS ARE TIED WITH STRIPS OF MOURNFUL BLACK ALPACA FOR A YEAR AND A DAY
7942-292240-0038 ENGINEERS DOCKMEN EXPRESS DRIVERS AND MECHANICS LARGELY MAKE UP THE CITIZENS OF CAMDEN OF COURSE CAMDEN HAS ITS SMUG CORNER WHERE PROSPEROUS MERCHANTS MOST DO CONGREGATE
7942-292240-0039 AND HAVE WINDOW BOXES AND A PIANO AND VERANDA CHAIRS AND TERRA COTTA STATUARY BUT FOR THE MOST PART THE HOUSES OF CAMDEN ARE RENTED AND RENTED CHEAP
7942-292240-0040 STRINGERS AND POSTS MARK THE PLACE WHERE PROUD PICKET FENCES ONCE STOOD THE PICKETS HAVING GONE FOR KINDLING LONG AGO IN THE WARM SUMMER EVENINGS MEN IN SHIRT SLEEVES SIT ON THE FRONT STEPS AND STOLIDLY SMOKE
7942-292240-0041 PARALLEL WITH MICKLE STREET A BLOCK AWAY ARE RAILWAY TRACKS THERE NOISY SWITCH ENGINES THAT NEVER KEEP SABBATH PUFF BACK AND FORTH DAY AND NIGHT
7942-292240-0042 SENDING SHOWERS OF SOOT AND SMOKE WHEN THE WIND IS RIGHT AND IT USUALLY IS
7942-292240-0043 WHERE ACCORDING TO JOHN ADDINGTON SYMONDS AND WILLIAM MICHAEL ROSSETTI LIVED THE MIGHTIEST SEER OF THE CENTURY
