6025-58760-0000 DURING THESE MONTHS THE LAND IS CONTINUALLY HEATED DAY AND NIGHT TO A HIGHER TEMPERATURE THAN THE WATER IN THE OCEAN SOUTH OF IT THE WINDS ARE PROBABLY NOT SO SEVERE DURING THE NIGHT AS THROUGH THE DAY AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE LAND AND THE WATER WILL NOT BE SO GREAT DURING THE NIGHT
6025-58760-0001 AND DIFFERENCE OF TEMPERATURE BETWEEN TWO POINTS USUALLY MEANS A PROPORTIONAL DIFFERENCE IN THE VELOCITY OF THE WIND THERE IS A TIME IN THE FALL AND SPRING WHILE THERE IS A STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE LAND AND WATER FOR SUPREMACY WHEN THE WINDS ARE VARIABLE
6025-58760-0002 ATTENDED WITH LOCAL STORMS SOMEWHAT AS WE HAVE THEM IN THE TEMPERATE ZONE
6025-58760-0003 THAN IS STORED UP IN THE DAY HENCE THE CONDITIONS DURING THE WINTER MONTHS ARE REVERSED THE WATER IS CONSTANTLY WARMER THAN THE LAND AND THERE IS A CONSTANT WIND BLOWING FROM THE LAND TO THE OCEAN WHICH CONTINUES UNTIL APRIL
6025-58760-0004 WHEN AFTER A SEASON OF LOCAL STORMS THE CONDITIONS ARE ESTABLISHED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION THESE WINDS ARE CALLED MONSOONS
6025-58760-0005 THAT IN SUMMER IT BLOWS IN A NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION FROM THE SEA AND IN THE WINTER IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION FROM THE LAND THIS DIVERGENCE FROM A DIRECT NORTH AND SOUTH IS CAUSED BY THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH AND THE EXPLANATION IS THE SAME AS THAT WE HAVE GIVEN FOR THE TRADE WINDS
6025-58760-0006 IN THE SOUTHERN LATITUDES THERE IS A COMPARATIVELY CONSTANT CONDITION OF WIND AND WEATHER BECAUSE THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE IN THESE REGIONS IS MOSTLY WATER BUT IN THE NORTH WHERE MOST OF THE LAND SURFACE IS LOCATED
6025-58760-0007 THE FREAKS OF WIND AND WEATHER THAT WE FIND PREVAILING UPON THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT ARE NOT SO EASILY ACCOUNTED FOR AS THE PHENOMENA HERETOFORE DISCUSSED IN THE NORTHERN PART THE LAND REACHES FAR UP TOWARD THE NORTH POLE WHILE ON THE WEST LIES THE PACIFIC OCEAN
6025-58760-0008 WHICH MERGES INTO THE ARCTIC OCEAN AT BERING STRAIT THE CLIMATE OF THE WESTERN COAST IS AFFECTED BY A WARM OCEAN CURRENT THAT SETS UP AS FAR NORTH AS ALASKA WHILE HIGH RANGES OF MOUNTAINS PREVENT THE EFFECTS OF THIS WARM CURRENT FROM BEING FELT INLAND TO ANY GREAT EXTENT
6025-58760-0009 ALL OF WHICH HELPS TO COMPLICATE ANY THEORY THAT MAY BE ADVANCED REGARDING CHANGES OF WEATHER ASIDE FROM THE CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE THAT ARE DUE TO THE SEASONS WHICH ARE CAUSED BY THE OSCILLATING MOTION OF THE EARTH BETWEEN THE LIMITS OF THE TROPIC OF CANCER ON THE NORTH
6025-58760-0010 AND THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN ON THE SOUTH THERE ARE OTHER CHANGES CONSTANTLY TAKING PLACE IN ALL SEASONS OF THE YEAR WHILE IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGE OF SEASONS AND THE GRADUAL CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE THAT WOULD NATURALLY FOLLOW
6025-58760-0011 OWING TO THE DIFFERENCE OF ANGLE AT WHICH THE SUN'S RAYS STRIKE THE EARTH IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE VIOLENT CHANGES THAT OCCUR SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE PROGRESS OF A SEASON AS WELL AS THE LESS VIOLENT ONES THAT COME EVERY FEW DAYS
6025-58760-0012 THE DIURNAL CHANGES ARE EASILY ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH ON ITS AXIS EACH DAY BUT THERE IS ANOTHER CLASS OF PHENOMENA WITH WHICH THE WEATHER MAN HAS TO STRUGGLE WHEN HE IS MAKING UP A FORECAST OF THE WEATHER FROM DAY TO DAY
6025-58760-0013 IN ORDER THAT WE MAY PROCEED INTELLIGENTLY LET US SAY A WORD ABOUT THE BAROMETER WE SPEAK OF HIGH AND LOW BAROMETER AND WE MAKE THE INSTRUMENT WITH GRADUATIONS MARKED FOR ALL KINDS OF WEATHER WHICH REALLY MEAN BUT VERY LITTLE
6025-58760-0014 THE READING OF A SINGLE BAROMETER ALONE WILL GIVE US BUT A FAINT IDEA OF WHAT IS REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN FROM DAY TO DAY
6025-58760-0015 BUT IF WE HAVE A SERIES OF BAROMETERS LOCATED AT DIFFERENT STATIONS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE CONTINENT AND CONNECTED AT HEADQUARTERS BY TELEGRAPH SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THE READINGS FROM A WHOLE SERIES OF BAROMETERS AT ONCE THEN IT BECOMES A VERY USEFUL INSTRUMENT
6025-58760-0016 A BAROMETER MAY READ LOW AT ONE STATION BY THE SCALE BUT MAY BE HIGH WITH REFERENCE TO SOME OTHER BAROMETER THAT READS VERY LOW WHAT IS A BAROMETER IF WE SHOULD TAKE A GLASS TUBE CLOSED AT ONE END THE AREA OF THE CROSS SECTION OF WHICH IS ONE INCH SQUARE
6025-58760-0017 AND FILL IT WITH MERCURY AND WHILE THUS FILLED PLUNGE THE OPEN END INTO A VESSEL OF MERCURY IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THE AMOUNT OF MERCURY REMAINING IN THE TUBE ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE MERCURY IN THE VESSEL WILL WEIGH ABOUT FIFTEEN POUNDS
6025-58760-0018 IF THE EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN PERFORMED AT SEA LEVEL THIS WILL VARY HOWEVER ACCORDING TO THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR OF COURSE BAROMETERS ARE TESTED WHEN THE AIR IS AT A CERTAIN TEMPERATURE IF THE WEIGHT OF MERCURY IN THE TUBE IS FIFTEEN POUNDS
6025-58760-0019 SINCE IT IS SUSTAINED BY THE AIR PRESSING DOWN ON THE MERCURY IN THE OPEN VESSEL IT SHOWS THAT THE AIR PRESSURE ON THAT OPEN VESSEL IS EQUAL TO FIFTEEN POUNDS TO THE SQUARE INCH IN PRACTICE OF COURSE THE TUBES ARE MADE VERY MUCH SMALLER
6025-58760-0020 BECAUSE THE PRESSURE ON THE MERCURY IN THE OPEN VESSEL IS LESS THAN FIFTEEN POUNDS TO THE SQUARE INCH AND AGAIN CONDITIONS MAY ARISE THAT WILL CONDENSE THE AIR AND MAKE IT FOR THE TIME BEING WEIGH MORE THAN FIFTEEN POUNDS TO THE SQUARE INCH IN WHICH CASE THE MERCURY WILL RISE IN THE TUBE
6025-58760-0021 THUS IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE BAROMETER WILL REGISTER THE SLIGHTEST CHANGE IN AIR PRESSURE LET US DWELL FOR A MOMENT ON THE CAUSES OF WHAT ARE COMMONLY CALLED CHANGES OF WEATHER WHEN WE WILL AGAIN REVERT TO THE USE OF THE BAROMETER
6025-58760-0022 THE USE OF THE TELEGRAPH IN CONNECTION WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A WEATHER BUREAU HAVING STATIONS FOR OBSERVATION AT CONVENIENT POINTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAS CONTRIBUTED MUCH TO THE SCIENCE OF METEOROLOGY IT IS FOUND THAT THERE ARE AREAS OF HIGH AND LOW PRESSURE EXISTING AT THE SAME TIME
6025-58760-0023 IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THESE USUALLY HAVE THEIR ORIGIN IN THE FAR NORTHWEST AND FOLLOW EACH OTHER SWEEPING DOWN THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS AND GRADUALLY BENDING EASTERLY AND FROM THAT TO NORTHEASTERLY BY THE TIME THEY REACH THE ATLANTIC COAST
6025-58760-0024 THE AREAS OF LOW PRESSURE ARE CALLED CYCLONES WHILE THE AREAS OF HIGH PRESSURE ARE CALLED ANTI CYCLONES BY CYCLONE WE DO NOT MEAN THOSE CLOUD FUNNELS COMMONLY CALLED BY THAT NAME THAT FORM AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR IN CERTAIN SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY AND PRODUCE SUCH DESTRUCTION OF LIFE AND PROPERTY
6025-58760-0025 THESE STORMS ARE USUALLY CONFINED TO A NARROW STRIP AND ARE SHORT LIVED THEY ARISE UNDOUBTEDLY FROM LOCAL CONDITIONS A DESCRIPTION OF THESE TORNADOES FOR SUCH IS THEIR TRUE NAME WILL BE GIVEN IN SOME FUTURE CHAPTER
6025-58760-0026 THESE CENTERS OF HIGH AND LOW PRESSURE MAY BE SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES APART IN THE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE IF IT IS IN THE WINTER SEASON THE WEATHER IS UNUSUALLY CLEAR AND COLD AND GENERALLY CLEAR
6025-58760-0027 AT THIS POINT IT WILL BE WARMER AND WINDS WILL PREVAIL WITH RAIN OR SNOW THE WINDS VARYING IN DIRECTION AND INTENSITY AT A GIVEN POINT AS THE CYCLONE MOVES FORWARD IN THE CENTER OF THESE CYCLONES AND ANTI CYCLONES THERE WILL BE A REGION OF COMPARATIVE CALM
6025-58760-0028 AND THE AIR IS ASCENDING AT THE CENTER OF THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WHILE IT IS POURING IN ON ALL SIDES FROM THE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WHERE THE AIR IS COMPRESSED BY A DOWNWARD CURRENT FROM THE UPPER REGIONS THE HIGH PRESSURE OR ANTI CYCLONE SYSTEM
6025-58760-0029 USUALLY COVERS A LARGER AREA THAN THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WHERE THE AIR IS ASCENDING WHILE THE AIR MOVES LATERALLY FROM HIGH TO LOW IT DOES NOT MOVE IN A DIRECT LINE THE AIR MOVEMENT
6025-58760-0030 OUTSIDE OF THE HIGH PRESSURE CENTER IS USUALLY NOT AT A VERY HIGH SPEED BUT IN NORTHERN LATITUDES IN THE DIRECTION OF THE HANDS OF A CLOCK AS IT CIRCLES AROUND IT WIDENS OUT SPIRALLY UNTIL IT REACHES THE EDGE OF A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM
6025-58760-0031 WHEN IT BENDS IN ITS COURSE AND MOVES IN THE OTHER DIRECTION AROUND THIS CENTER BUT CONSTANTLY MOVING INWARD TOWARD IT IN A SPIRAL FORM AND IN A DIRECTION THAT IS REVERSE TO THAT OF THE HANDS OF A CLOCK
6025-58760-0032 THE VELOCITY OF ITS MOVEMENT IS VERY MUCH ACCELERATED UNTIL IT HAS MOVED INTO THE ZONE OF QUIET AIR IN THE CENTER WHERE IT IS ASCENDING IN THE UPPER REGIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE THERE ARE COUNTER CURRENTS FLOWING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
6025-58760-0033 THE DOWNWARD FLOW AT THE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE COMPRESSES THE AIR NEAR THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH AND RAREFIES IT IN THE HIGHER REGIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE WHILE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT IS GOING ON OVER THE CENTER OF LOW PRESSURE THE AIR BEING RAREFIED NEARER THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH
6025-58760-0034 BUT CONDENSED ABOVE NORMAL IN THE HIGHER REGIONS BY THE UPWARD CURRENT WHICH CAUSES AN OVERFLOW BACK TOWARD THE RAREFIED UPPER REGIONS OVER THE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT THE ORDINARY STORM HAS A COMPOUND MOTION
6025-58760-0035 THE WHOLE SYSTEM MOVES IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION WHILE THE WINDS ARE BLOWING SPIRALLY ABOUT THE STORM CENTER IF WE SHOULD BE IN THE TRACK OF A MOVING STORM SO THAT ITS CENTER PASSED OVER US THE WINDS AT THE BEGINNING WOULD BLOW IN ONE DIRECTION
6025-58760-0036 WHEN WE SHOULD FEEL THE WIND IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION UNTIL THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE HAD MOVED FORWARD INTO THE REGION OF HIGH PRESSURE
6025-58760-0037 THE STEEPER THE GRADE THE MORE RAPIDLY THE FLUID WILL FLOW LET US NOW HAVE RECOURSE FOR A MOMENT TO FIGS ONE TWO AND THREE IN ORDER THAT THE SUBJECT MAY BE MORE FULLY UNDERSTOOD IN LOOKING AT THESE DIAGRAMS WE SHOULD IMAGINE OURSELVES LOOKING SOUTH
6025-58760-0038 ONE OF HIGH AND THE OTHER OF LOW PRESSURE THE ARROWS SHOW THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE WIND YOU WILL NOTICE THAT IN THE UPPER REGIONS IT BLOWS IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM THE AIR MOVEMENT ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH
6025-58760-0039 HOW THE WIND MOVES SPIRALLY AROUND BOTH CENTERS OVER THE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE THE AIR DESCENDS SPIRALLY FROM THE UPPER REGIONS CIRCLING AROUND A LARGE AREA
6025-58760-0040 AND CIRCLES OUTWARDLY UNTIL IT FINALLY MOVES OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF A LOW PRESSURE AREA GRADUALLY BENDING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION UNTIL FINALLY IT MOVES THE REVERSE OF THE HANDS OF A CLOCK
6025-58760-0041 IT MOVES SPIRALLY AND UPWARDLY ABOUT THE LOW PRESSURE AREA UNTIL IT REACHES A POINT IN THE UPPER AIR
6025-58760-0042 NOW IMAGINE THE WHOLE COMBINATION MOVING FROM WEST TO EAST AT AN AVERAGE RATE OF THIRTY MILES PER HOUR AND IMAGINE FURTHER THAT THIS SYSTEM IS LINKED TO OTHER SYSTEMS THAT ARE FOLLOWING ALONG
6025-58760-0043 AND YOU HAVE SOME IDEA OF THE WEATHER CHANGES AS THEY OCCUR IN THE MIDDLE UNITED STATES BY REFERRING TO FIG THREE YOU WILL SEE WHY THE WIND CHANGES ITS DIRECTION WHEN A STORM CENTER PASSES OVER ANY POINT
6025-58760-0044 AND SEE WHAT PART IT PLAYS IN PREDICTING CHANGES IN THE WEATHER
6025-58760-0045 AND OWING TO THE PECULIAR WAY IT ASCENDS BY CIRCLING SPIRALLY UPWARD AROUND A REGION OF COMPARATIVE CALM IT CREATES A PARTIAL VACUUM WHICH IS MORE PRONOUNCED IN THE CENTER OF THE AREA
6025-58760-0046 AT THE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE THE AIR WILL BE CONDENSED BY THE DESCENDING CURRENT BEING ARRESTED BY THE EARTH THE DESCENDING CURRENT COMING AS IT DOES FROM THE UPPER AND COLDER REGIONS ACCOUNTS FOR THE COOL WEATHER THAT MOST ALWAYS PREVAILS AT A HIGH PRESSURE AREA
6025-58760-0047 IN ORDER TO KNOW HOW GREAT THE CHANGE OF WEATHER IS LIKELY TO BE WE MUST KNOW WHAT THE READINGS OF AT LEAST TWO BAROMETERS ARE ONE AT THE HIGH AND ANOTHER AT THE LOW PRESSURE AREA IF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE READINGS OF THE TWO BAROMETERS IS VERY GREAT
6025-58760-0048 WE MAY EXPECT THE CHANGE TO BE SUDDEN AND VIOLENT HIGH AND LOW AS APPLIED TO A BAROMETER ARE ONLY RELATIVE TERMS THERE IS NO FIXED POINT ON THE INDEX OF THE INSTRUMENT THAT CAN BE SAID TO BE ARBITRARILY HIGH OR LOW
6025-58760-0049 FOR THIS REASON A SINGLE BAROMETER IS NOT OF MUCH USE IF IT BEGINS TO FALL FROM ANY POINT AND FALLS RAPIDLY IT INDICATES THAT AN AREA OF A MUCH LOWER PRESSURE IS APPROACHING THE SAME IS TRUE OF A HIGH PRESSURE AREA IF THE BAROMETER RISES RAPIDLY FROM ANY POINT
6025-58760-0050 IF WE STUDY THE AIR MOTIONS IN THESE SYSTEMS SUFFICIENTLY TO GET AT LEAST AN INKLING OF THE LAW OF THEIR MOVEMENTS IT BECOMES A VERY INTERESTING SUBJECT
