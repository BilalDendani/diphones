75-854-0000 HAD DRIVEN THE OTHER OFF FROM A HEAP OF RUBBISH WHICH HAD BEEN CARRIED WITHOUT THE WALLS EACH PARTY HAD A FLAG ATTACHED TO A STICK AND THE BOYS WERE ARMED WITH CLUBS SUCH AS THOSE CARRIED BY THE APPRENTICE BOYS MANY OF THEM CARRIED MIMIC SHIELDS MADE OF WOOD
75-854-0001 SEE THE BLOOD IS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE ONE WOULD SCARCELY EXPECT TO SEE THESE VARLETS OF THE CITY PLAYING SO ROUGHLY THE CITIZENS HAVE PROVED THEMSELVES STURDY FIGHTERS BEFORE NOW MY PRINCE THE OTHER SAID THEY ARE EVER INDEPENDENT AND HOLD TO THEIR RIGHTS EVEN AGAINST THE KING
75-854-0002 REACHED THE TOP OF THE HEAP WELL DONE THE YOUNG PRINCE EXCLAIMED CLAPPING HIS HANDS SEE HOW HE LAYS ABOUT HIM WITH THAT CLUB OF HIS THERE HE HAS KNOCKED DOWN THE LEADER OF THE DEFENDERS AS IF HIS CLUB HAD BEEN A BATTLE AXE WELL DONE YOUNG SIR WELL DONE
75-854-0003 BUT HIS FOLLOWERS WAVER
75-854-0004 STAND YOU COWARDS RALLY ROUND YOUR LEADER AND IN HIS ENTHUSIASM THE YOUNG PRINCE URGED HIS HORSE FORWARD TO THE SCENE OF CONFLICT BUT THE ASSAILANTS WERE MASTERED
75-854-0005 HEAVY BLOWS WERE EXCHANGED AND BLOOD FLOWED FREELY FROM MANY OF THEIR HEADS AND FACES FOR IN THOSE DAYS BOYS THOUGHT LESS THAN THEY DO NOW OF HARD KNOCKS AND MANLINESS AND COURAGE WERE CONSIDERED THE FIRST OF VIRTUES
75-854-0006 THOUGH HARDLY PRESSED ON ALL SIDES
75-854-0007 IN VAIN HIS FOLLOWERS ATTEMPTED TO COME TO HIS RESCUE EACH TIME THEY STRUGGLED UP THE HEAP THEY WERE BEATEN BACK AGAIN BY THOSE ON THE CREST
75-854-0008 URGED HIS HORSE FORWARD CEASE HE SAID AUTHORITATIVELY
75-854-0009 HITHERTO THE LADS ABSORBED IN THEIR STRIFE HAD PAID BUT LITTLE HEED TO THE PARTY OF ONLOOKERS BUT AT THE WORD
75-854-0010 AND BARING THEIR HEADS STOOD STILL IN CONFUSION NO HARM IS DONE THE PRINCE SAID
75-854-0011 HE MOVES NOT LIFT HIS HEAD FROM THE GROUND THE BOY WAS INDEED STILL INSENSIBLE MY LORDS THE PRINCE SAID TO THE KNIGHTS WHO HAD NOW RIDDEN UP I FEAR THAT THIS BOY IS BADLY HURT
75-854-0012 CITIZEN'S SON THOUGH HE BE MY LORD DE VAUX WILL YOU BID YOUR SQUIRE RIDE AT FULL SPEED TO THE TOWER AND TELL MASTER ROGER THE LEECH TO COME HERE WITH ALL HASTE
75-854-0013 THE TOWER WAS BUT HALF A MILE DISTANT BUT BEFORE MASTER ROGER ARRIVED WALTER HAD ALREADY RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS
75-854-0014 YOU HAVE ARRIVED TOO LATE MASTER ROGER THE PRINCE SAID
75-854-0015 THE LEECH POURED SOME CORDIAL FROM A VIAL INTO A SMALL SILVER CUP AND HELD IT TO THE BOY'S LIPS IT WAS POTENT AND NIGH TOOK HIS BREATH AWAY BUT WHEN HE HAD DRUNK IT HE STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET
75-854-0016 WHAT IS THY NAME GOOD LAD THE PRINCE ASKED I AM KNOWN AS WALTER FLETCHER YOU ARE A BRAVE LAD THE PRINCE SAID AND IF YOU BEAR YOU AS WELL AS A MAN AS YOU DID BUT NOW
75-854-0017 THAT YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR SHARE OF FIGHTING AS STARK AS THAT OF THE ASSAULT OF YON HEAP NOW MY LORDS LET US RIDE ON
75-854-0018 TO INFORM HIS FRIEND GEOFFREY OF THE HONOUR WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HIM OF BEING ADDRESSED BY THE PRINCE OF WALES DURING THE INTERVAL HE WAS FORCED TO LIE ABED AND HE WAS SOUNDLY RATED BY MASTER GILES FOR AGAIN GETTING INTO MISCHIEF
75-854-0019 GEOFFREY WAS FAR MORE SYMPATHETIC AND SAID WELL WALTER ALTHOUGH I WOULD NOT THAT GAFFER GILES HEARD ME SAY SO I THINK YOU HAVE HAD A PIECE OF RARE GOOD FORTUNE
75-854-0020 YOU COULD WISH FOR NOTHING BETTER THAN TO RIDE BEHIND THE PRINCE OF WALES HE IS BY ALL ACCOUNTS
75-854-0021 YOUNG AS HE IS TO BE ALREADY HIGHLY SKILLED IN ARMS MEN SAY THAT HE WILL BE A WISE KING AND A GALLANT CAPTAIN SUCH A ONE AS A BRAVE SOLDIER MIGHT BE PROUD TO FOLLOW
75-854-0022 OF DISTINGUISHING HIMSELF THOSE WHO RIDE WITH HIM MAY BE CERTAIN OF A CHANCE OF DOING VALOROUS DEEDS I WILL GO ACROSS THE BRIDGE TOMORROW AND WILL HAVE A TALK WITH MASTER FLETCHER THE SOONER YOU ARE APPRENTICED
75-854-0023 THE SOONER YOU WILL BE OUT OF YOUR TIME AND SINCE MADGE MARRIED EIGHT YEARS SINCE I HAVE BEEN LONELY IN THE HOUSE AND SHALL BE GLAD TO HAVE YOU WITH ME GEOFFREY WARD FOUND HIS FRIEND MORE READY TO ACCEDE TO HIS REQUEST
75-854-0024 THAT WALTER SHOULD BE APPRENTICED TO HIM THAN HE HAD EXPECTED THE BOWYER INDEED WAS A QUIET MAN
75-854-0025 GAVE HIM SO MUCH UNEASINESS THAT HE WAS NOT SORRY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF KEEPING HIM IN ORDER SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN BY GEOFFREY MOREOVER HE COULD NOT BUT AGREE WITH THE ARGUMENT THAT THE PROMISE OF THE PRINCE OF WALES OFFERED A MORE FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR WALTER
75-854-0026 TO ENTER UPON THE CAREER OF ARMS AND SO PERHAPS SOMEDAY TO WIN HIS WAY BACK TO RANK AND HONOURS THAN COULD HAVE BEEN LOOKED FOR THEREFORE ON THE FOLLOWING WEEK WALTER WAS INDENTURED TO THE ARMOURER AND AS WAS USUAL AT THE TIME
75-854-0027 HIS FRAME AND MUSCLES DEVELOPED WITH LABOUR AND HE WAS NOW ABLE TO SWING ALL SAVE THE VERY HEAVIEST HAMMERS IN THE SHOP HE HAD NEVER ABATED IN HIS PRACTICE AT ARMS AND EVERY DAY WHEN WORK WAS OVER
75-854-0028 HE AND HIS MASTER HAD A LONG BOUT TOGETHER WITH CUDGEL OR QUARTERSTAFF SWORD OR AXE
75-854-0029 THAT GEOFFREY WARD ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE NEEDED TO PUT OUT ALL HIS SKILL TO HOLD HIS OWN WITH HIS PUPIL BUT IT WAS NOT ALONE WITH GEOFFREY THAT WALTER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF LEARNING THE USE OF ARMS WHENEVER A SOLDIER RETURNED FROM THE WARS
75-854-0030 WHOM GEOFFREY REPRESENTED AS BEING EAGER TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE SWORD AS WELL AS HOW TO MAKE IT THUS WALTER BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO DIFFERENT STYLES OF FIGHTING
75-854-0031 AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN WALTER HAD WON THE PRIZE AT THE SPORTS BOTH FOR THE BEST CUDGEL PLAY AND THE BEST SWORD AND BUCKLER PLAY AMONG THE APPRENTICES TO THE GREAT DISGUST OF MANY WHO HAD ALMOST REACHED THE AGE OF MANHOOD AND WERE JUST OUT OF THEIR TIME
75-854-0032 ON SUNDAYS WALTER ALWAYS SPENT THE DAY WITH GILES FLETCHER AND HIS WIFE GOING TO MASS WITH THEM AND WALKING IN THE FIELDS WHERE
75-854-0033 HE HAD TAKEN NO PART IN THE FIGHTS AND FROLICS OF HIS FORMER COMRADES HE WAS IN FACT FAR TOO TIRED AT THE END OF HIS DAY'S WORK TO HAVE ANY DESIRE TO DO AUGHT BUT TO SIT AND LISTEN TO THE TALES OF THE WARS
75-854-0034 LIKING BETTER TO HANG ABOUT TAVERNS DRINKING AT THE EXPENSE OF THOSE TO WHOM THEY RELATED FABULOUS TALES OF THE GALLANT ACTIONS THEY HAD PERFORMED MANY TOO WANDERED OVER THE COUNTRY SOMETIMES IN TWOS OR THREES SOMETIMES IN LARGE BANDS
75-854-0035 FOR GREAT TRACTS OF FORESTS STILL COVERED A LARGE PORTION OF THE COUNTRY
75-854-0036 IN THE COUNTRY ROUND LONDON THESE PESTS WERE VERY NUMEROUS FOR HERE MORE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE WAS THERE A CHANCE OF PLUNDER
75-854-0037 SINCE SEARCHERS COULD BE SEEN APPROACHING A LONG WAY OFF AND ESCAPE COULD BE MADE BY PATHS ACROSS THE SWAMP
75-854-0038 FURTHER SOUTH IN THE WILD COUNTRY ROUND WESTERHAM WHERE MILES OF HEATH AND FOREST STRETCHED AWAY IN ALL DIRECTIONS WAS ANOTHER NOTED PLACE
75-854-0039 THE LAWS IN THOSE DAYS WERE EXTREMELY SEVERE AND DEATH WAS THE PENALTY OF THOSE CAUGHT PLUNDERING THE EXTREME SEVERITY OF THE LAWS HOWEVER OPERATED IN FAVOUR OF ITS BREAKERS
75-854-0040 OR GIVE TESTIMONY WHICH WOULD COST THE LIFE OF A FELLOW CREATURE THE CITIZENS OF LONDON WERE LOUD IN THEIR COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE DISCHARGED SOLDIERS
75-854-0041 AND IT WAS ON THEIR PETITIONS TO THE KING THAT THE SHERIFFS OF MIDDLESEX
75-854-0042 WERE GENERALLY STIRRED UP TO PUT DOWN THE ILL DOERS SOMETIMES THESE HUNTS WERE CONDUCTED IN A WHOLESALE WAY AND THE WHOLE POSSE OF A COUNTY WOULD BE CALLED OUT THEN ALL FOUND WITHIN ITS LIMITS
75-854-0043 WHEN THEY FOUND THE COUNTRY BECOMING TOO HOT FOR THEM THESE MEN WOULD TAKE SERVICE WITH SOME KNIGHT OR NOBLE GOING TO THE WAR ANXIOUS TO TAKE WITH HIM AS STRONG A FOLLOWING AS MIGHT BE AND NOT TOO PARTICULAR AS TO THE CHARACTER OF HIS SOLDIERS
75-854-0044 WALTER BEING OF AN ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT WAS SOMETIMES WONT OF A SUMMER EVENING WHEN HIS WORK WAS DONE TO WANDER ACROSS THE MARSHES TAKING WITH HIM HIS BOW AND ARROWS AND OFTEN BRINGING HOME A WILD DUCK OR TWO WHICH HE SHOT IN THE POOLS
75-854-0045 MORE THAN ONCE SURLY MEN HAD ACCOSTED HIM AND HAD THREATENED TO KNOCK HIM ON THE HEAD IF THEY AGAIN FOUND HIM WANDERING THAT WAY BUT WALTER LAUGHED AT THEIR THREATS
75-854-0046 THEY WERE CONTENT TO LEAVE HIM ALONE ONE DAY
75-854-0047 HE SAW A FIGURE MAKING HIS WAY ACROSS THE HOUR WAS ALREADY LATE AND THE NIGHT WAS FALLING AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE MAN WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE USUAL DENIZENS OF THE SWAMP
75-854-0048 THAT WALTER WONDERED WHAT BUSINESS THERE MIGHT BE SCARCELY KNOWING WHY HE DID SO WALTER THREW HIMSELF DOWN AMONG SOME LOW BRUSHWOOD AND WATCHED THE APPROACHING FIGURE WHEN HE CAME NEAR
75-854-0049 HE RECOGNIZED THE FACE AND SAW TO HIS SURPRISE THAT IT WAS A KNIGHT
75-854-0050 HE HAD PARTICULARLY NOTICED HIM BECAUSE OF THE ARROGANT MANNER IN WHICH HE SPOKE WALTER HAD HIMSELF PUT IN THE RIVETS AND HAD THOUGHT AS HE BUCKLED ON THE ARMOUR AGAIN HOW UNPLEASANT A COUNTENANCE WAS THAT OF ITS WEARER
75-854-0051 HE WAS A TALL AND POWERFUL MAN AND WOULD HAVE BEEN HANDSOME HAD NOT HIS EYES BEEN TOO CLOSELY SET TOGETHER HIS NOSE WAS NARROW AND THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE REMINDED WALTER OF A HAWK
75-854-0052 IT IS ASSUREDLY NO BUSINESS OF MINE BUT IT MAY LEAD TO AN ADVENTURE AND I HAVE HAD NO REAL FUN SINCE I LEFT ALDGATE I WILL FOLLOW
75-854-0053 THE KNIGHT PAUSED AND LOOKED ROUND AS IF UNCERTAIN OF HIS WAY
75-854-0054 WALTER SAW A FIGURE APPEAR ABOVE SOME BUSHES SOME FOUR HUNDRED YARDS DISTANT THE KNIGHT AT ONCE DIRECTED HIS STEPS IN THAT DIRECTION AND WALTER CREPT CAUTIOUSLY AFTER HIM A PEST UPON THESE SWAMPS AND QUAGMIRES THE KNIGHT SAID ANGRILY AS HE NEARED THE OTHER
75-854-0055 FOR THE LIGHT IS WANING FAST IT WERE ILL FOR ANYONE I CAUGHT PRYING ABOUT HERE BUT COME IN SIR KNIGHT MY HOVEL IS NOT WHAT YOUR LORDSHIP IS ACCUSTOMED TO BUT WE MAY AS WELL TALK THERE AS HERE BENEATH THE SKY THE TWO MEN DISAPPEARED FROM WALTER'S SIGHT THE LATTER
75-854-0056 HE WAS UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR DISAPPEARANCE THEN HE SAW THAT THE SPOT ALTHOUGH APPARENTLY A MERE CLUMP OF BUSHES NO HIGHER THAN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS REALLY AN ELEVATED HUMMOCK OF GROUND
75-854-0057 WITHOUT SUSPECTING THAT AUGHT LAY AMONG THEM IN THE CENTRE HOWEVER THE GROUND HAD BEEN CUT AWAY AND A LOW DOORWAY ALMOST HIDDEN BY THE BUSHES GAVE ACCESS INTO A HALF SUBTERRANEAN HUT
75-854-0058 THE ROOF WAS FORMED OF AN OLD BOAT TURNED BOTTOM UPWARDS AND THIS HAD BEEN COVERED WITH BROWN TURF IT WAS AN EXCELLENT PLACE OF CONCEALMENT
75-854-0059 WITHOUT SUSPECTING THAT AUGHT LAY CONCEALED WITHIN THEM A CLEVER HIDING PLACE WALTER THOUGHT TO HIMSELF NO WONDER THE POSSE SEARCH THESE SWAMPS IN VAIN THIS IS THE LOWEST AND WETTEST PART OF THE SWAMP AND WOULD BE BUT LIGHTLY SEARCHED
75-854-0060 FOR NONE WOULD SUSPECT THAT THERE WAS A HUMAN HABITATION AMONG THESE BROWN DITCHES AND STAGNANT POOLS TO HIS DISAPPOINTMENT THE LAD COULD HEAR NOTHING OF THE CONVERSATION WHICH WAS GOING ON WITHIN THE HUT THE MURMUR OF VOICES CAME TO HIS EAR BUT NO WORDS WERE AUDIBLE
75-854-0061 IF ONE BOAT RUNS INTO ANOTHER NO ONE NEED BE SURPRISED
75-854-0062 I WOULD NOT GIVE MUCH FOR YOUR LIFE IF YOU TRIED TO FIND THE WAY ALONE WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WHEN YOU GOT ME OFF FROM BEING HUNG AFTER THAT LITTLE AFFAIR AT BRUGES
75-854-0063 YOU MAY BE SURE THE KNIGHT REPLIED
75-854-0064 IS ALWAYS HANDY IN TIMES LIKE THESE
75-854-0065 DID IT NOT STRIKE YOU SIR KNIGHT THAT IT MIGHT ENTER MY MIND THAT IT WOULD BE VERY ADVISABLE FOR ME TO FREE MYSELF FROM ONE WHO STANDS TOWARDS ME IN THAT RELATION
75-854-0066 THAT MATTER DID NOT TROUBLE ME I KNEW BETTER THAN TO BRING MONEY INTO THIS SWAMP OF YOURS WHEN I MIGHT BE ATTACKED BY HALF A DOZEN RUFFIANS LIKE YOURSELF
75-854-0067 BIDDING HIM IN CASE I CAME NOT BACK TO SET A HUE AND CRY ON FOOT
75-854-0068 WITH THE ESPECIAL DESCRIPTION OF YOUR WORTHY SELF WALTER COULD HEAR NO MORE HE HAD TAKEN OFF HIS SHOES AND FOLLOWED THEM AT A DISTANCE AND THEIR VOICES STILL ACTED AS A GUIDE TO HIM THROUGH THE SWAMP BUT HE FEARED TO KEEP TOO CLOSE
75-854-0069 AS ALTHOUGH THE DARKNESS WOULD CONCEAL HIS FIGURE HE MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT TREAD IN A POOL OR DITCH AND SO BETRAY HIS PRESENCE PUTTING HIS FOOT EACH TIME TO THE GROUND WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION HE MOVED QUIETLY AFTER THEM
75-854-0070 THEY SPOKE LITTLE MORE BUT THEIR HEAVY FOOTSTEPS ON THE SWAMPY GROUND WERE A SUFFICIENT GUIDANCE FOR HIM AT LAST
75-854-0071 AND THEN HE HEARD RETURNING STEPS HE DREW ASIDE A FEW FEET AND CROUCHED DOWN SAW A DIM FIGURE PASS THROUGH THE MIST AND THEN RESUMED HIS WAY THE GROUND WAS FIRMER NOW AND REPLACING HIS SHOES HE WALKED BRISKLY ON
75-854-0072 THE MARSHES SEARCHED FROM END TO END AND ALL FOUND THERE SHOULD BE KNOCKED ON HEAD AND THROWN INTO THEIR OWN DITCHES THERE WOULD BE NO FEAR OF ANY HONEST MAN COMING TO HIS END THEREBY BUT NOW TO BED LAD
75-854-0073 AND THE FIRE MUST BE ALIGHT AT DAYBREAK ON HIS WAY BACK
75-854-0074 WHETHER TO INFORM HIS MASTER OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED HE WAS HOWEVER BENT UPON HAVING AN ADVENTURE ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT AND
75-854-0075 AND TWO OF THE PARTY TAKING OARS THEY STARTED UP THE RIVER NOW I WILL TELL YOU WHAT WE ARE BENT ON WALTER SAID FROM SOME WORDS I OVERHEARD
75-854-0076 ARE THIS EVENING GOING TO MAKE AN ATTACK UPON A BOAT WITH A LADY IN IT COMING DOWN THE RIVER WE WILL BE ON THE SPOT
75-854-0077 I HAVE NOT THE LEAST IDEA I ONLY CAUGHT A FEW WORDS AND MAY BE WRONG
75-854-0078 THE TIDE WAS RUNNING DOWN STRONGLY
75-854-0079 IT WAS FINE NOW BUT THE STREAM WAS RUNNING DOWN THICK AND TURBID
75-854-0080 THEY ROWED BY TURNS ALL WERE FAIRLY EXPERT AT THE EXERCISE FOR IN THOSE DAYS THE THAMES WAS AT ONCE THE GREAT HIGHWAY AND PLAYGROUND OF LONDON
75-854-0081 OF ITALY AND THE LOW COUNTRIES WHILE FROM ABOVE THE GRAIN NEEDED FOR THE WANTS OF THE GREAT CITY WAS FLOATED DOWN IN BARGES FROM THE WEST
