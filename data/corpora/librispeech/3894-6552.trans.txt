3894-6552-0000 THEN THE SLOPE GOT STEEPER AND THE SURFACE MUCH WORSE AND WE HAD TO TAKE OFF OUR SKI THE PULLING AFTER THIS WAS EXTRAORDINARILY FATIGUING WE SANK ABOVE OUR FINNESKO EVERYWHERE AND IN PLACES NEARLY TO OUR KNEES
3894-6552-0001 ALL THE TIME THEY WERE LITERALLY PLOUGHING THE SNOW WE REACHED THE TOP OF THE SLOPE AT FIVE AND STARTED ON AFTER TEA ON THE DOWN GRADE ON THIS WE HAD TO PULL ALMOST AS HARD AS ON THE UPWARD SLOPE BUT COULD JUST MANAGE TO GET ALONG ON SKI
3894-6552-0002 AND WILSON TOLD ME SOME VERY ALARMING NEWS CONCERNING IT IT APPEARS THAT ATKINSON SAYS THAT WRIGHT IS GETTING PLAYED OUT AND LASHLY IS NOT SO FIT AS HE WAS OWING TO THE HEAVY PULLING SINCE THE BLIZZARD I HAVE NOT FELT SATISFIED ABOUT THIS PARTY
3894-6552-0003 THE FINISH OF THE MARCH TO DAY SHOWED CLEARLY THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG THEY FELL A LONG WAY BEHIND HAD TO TAKE OFF SKI
3894-6552-0004 TRUE THE SURFACE WAS AWFUL AND GROWING WORSE EVERY MOMENT
3894-6552-0005 AS FOR MYSELF I NEVER FELT FITTER
3894-6552-0006 P O EVANS OF COURSE IS A TOWER OF STRENGTH BUT OATES AND WILSON ARE DOING SPLENDIDLY ALSO HERE WHERE WE ARE CAMPED THE SNOW IS WORSE THAN I HAVE EVER SEEN IT BUT WE ARE IN A HOLLOW EVERY STEP HERE ONE SINKS TO THE KNEES
3894-6552-0007 AND THE UNEVEN SURFACE IS OBVIOUSLY INSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE SLEDGES PERHAPS THIS WIND IS A BLESSING IN DISGUISE
3894-6552-0008 THINGS ARE NOT SO ROSY AS THEY MIGHT BE BUT WE KEEP OUR SPIRITS UP AND SAY THE LUCK MUST TURN THIS IS ONLY TO TELL YOU THAT I FIND I CAN KEEP UP WITH THE REST AS WELL AS OF OLD
3894-6552-0009 A VERY GOOD DAY FROM ONE POINT OF VIEW VERY BAD FROM ANOTHER WE STARTED STRAIGHT OUT OVER THE GLACIER AND PASSED THROUGH A GOOD DEAL OF DISTURBANCE WE PULLED ON SKI AND THE DOGS FOLLOWED
3894-6552-0010 AND WE MUST HAVE PASSED OVER A GOOD MANY CREVASSES UNDISCOVERED BY US THANKS TO SKI AND BY THE DOGS OWING TO THE SOFT SNOW IN ONE ONLY SEAMAN EVANS DROPPED A LEG SKI AND ALL
3894-6552-0011 OLD MAN HAULING PARTY MADE HEAVY WEATHER AT FIRST BUT WHEN RELIEVED OF A LITTLE WEIGHT AND HAVING CLEANED THEIR RUNNERS
3894-6552-0012 STARTING ABOUT ELEVEN BY THREE O'CLOCK WE WERE CLEAR OF THE PRESSURE AND I CAMPED THE DOGS DISCHARGED OUR LOADS
3894-6552-0013 EVERY NOW AND AGAIN THE SLEDGE SANK IN A SOFT PATCH WHICH BROUGHT US UP
3894-6552-0014 WE GOT SIDEWAYS TO THE SLEDGE AND HAULED IT OUT EVANS P O
3894-6552-0015 THE GREAT THING IS TO KEEP THE SLEDGE MOVING AND FOR AN HOUR OR MORE THERE WERE DOZENS OF CRITICAL MOMENTS WHEN IT ALL BUT STOPPED
3894-6552-0016 THE LATTER WERE VERY TRYING AND TIRING BUT SUDDENLY THE SURFACE GREW MORE UNIFORM AND WE MORE ACCUSTOMED TO THE GAME FOR AFTER A LONG STOP TO LET THE OTHER PARTIES COME UP I STARTED AT SIX AND RAN ON TILL SEVEN
3894-6552-0017 PULLING EASILY WITHOUT A HALT AT THE RATE OF ABOUT TWO MILES AN HOUR I WAS VERY JUBILANT ALL DIFFICULTIES SEEMED TO BE VANISHING BUT UNFORTUNATELY OUR HISTORY WAS NOT REPEATED WITH THE OTHER PARTIES BOWERS CAME UP ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AFTER US THEY ALSO HAD DONE WELL AT THE LAST
3894-6552-0018 AND I'M PRETTY SURE THEY WILL GET ON ALL RIGHT KEOHANE IS THE ONLY WEAK SPOT AND HE ONLY I THINK BECAUSE BLIND TEMPORARILY BUT EVANS PARTY DIDN'T GET UP TILL TEN THEY STARTED QUITE WELL BUT GOT INTO DIFFICULTIES
3894-6552-0019 DID JUST THE WRONG THING BY STRAINING AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SO TIRING THEMSELVES WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE THEIR SKI SHOES TOO ARE OUT OF TRIM JUST AS I THOUGHT WE WERE IN FOR MAKING A GREAT SCORE THIS DIFFICULTY OVERTAKES US
3894-6552-0020 IT IS DREADFULLY TRYING THE SNOW AROUND US TO NIGHT IS TERRIBLY SOFT ONE SINKS TO THE KNEE AT EVERY STEP IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DRAG SLEDGES ON FOOT AND VERY DIFFICULT FOR DOGS SKI ARE THE THING AND HERE ARE MY
3894-6552-0021 THE DOGS SHOULD GET BACK QUITE EASILY THERE IS FOOD ALL ALONG THE LINE THE GLACIER WIND SPRANG UP ABOUT SEVEN THE MORNING WAS VERY FINE AND WARM TO NIGHT THERE IS SOME STRATUS CLOUD FORMING A HINT NO MORE BAD WEATHER IN SIGHT
3894-6552-0022 A PLENTIFUL CROP OF SNOW BLINDNESS DUE TO INCAUTION THE SUFFERERS EVANS BOWERS KEOHANE LASHLY OATES IN VARIOUS DEGREES
3894-6552-0023 IT PROVED TO BE A VERY COARSE GRANITE WITH LARGE CRYSTALS OF QUARTZ IN IT EVIDENTLY THE ROCK OF WHICH THE PILLARS OF THE GATEWAY AND OTHER NEIGHBOURING HILLS ARE FORMED
3894-6552-0024 WE GOT BOGGED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND DO WHAT WE WOULD THE SLEDGE DRAGGED LIKE LEAD THE OTHERS WERE WORKING HARD
3894-6552-0025 PRETTY WELL COOKED AND THERE WAS DISCLOSED THE SECRET OF OUR TROUBLE IN A THIN FILM WITH SOME HARD KNOTS OF ICE ON THE RUNNERS EVANS TEAM HAD BEEN SENT OFF IN ADVANCE AND WE DIDN'T COULDN'T CATCH THEM BUT THEY SAW US CAMP AND BREAK CAMP AND FOLLOWED SUIT
3894-6552-0026 I REALLY DREADED STARTING AFTER LUNCH BUT AFTER SOME TROUBLE TO BREAK THE SLEDGE OUT WE WENT AHEAD WITHOUT A HITCH AND IN A MILE OR TWO RECOVERED OUR LEADING PLACE WITH OBVIOUS ABILITY TO KEEP IT AT SIX I SAW THE OTHER TEAMS WERE FLAGGING AND SO CAMPED AT SEVEN
3894-6552-0027 MEANING TO TURN OUT EARLIER TO MORROW AND START A BETTER ROUTINE WE HAVE DONE ABOUT EIGHT OR PERHAPS NINE MILES STAT
3894-6552-0028 IT IS EVIDENT THAT WHAT I EXPECTED HAS OCCURRED THE WHOLE OF THE LOWER VALLEY IS FILLED WITH SNOW FROM THE RECENT STORM AND IF WE HAD NOT HAD SKI WE SHOULD BE HOPELESSLY BOGGED
3894-6552-0029 ON FOOT ONE SINKS TO THE KNEES AND IF PULLING ON A SLEDGE TO HALF WAY BETWEEN KNEE AND THIGH IT WOULD THEREFORE BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO ADVANCE ON FOOT WITH OUR LOADS CONSIDERING ALL THINGS WE ARE GETTING BETTER ON SKI
3894-6552-0030 A CRUST IS FORMING OVER THE SOFT SNOW IN A WEEK OR SO I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO SUPPORT SLEDGES AND MEN AT PRESENT IT CARRIES NEITHER PROPERLY THE SLEDGES GET BOGGED EVERY NOW AND AGAIN SINKING TO THE CROSSBARS
3894-6552-0031 NEEDLESS TO SAY THE HAULING IS TERRIBLE WHEN THIS OCCURS WE STEERED FOR THE COMMONWEALTH RANGE DURING THE FORENOON TILL WE REACHED ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE GLACIER
3894-6552-0032 OBSERVING THIS I ALTERED COURSE FOR THE CLOUDMAKER AND LATER STILL FARTHER TO THE WEST WE MUST BE GETTING A MUCH BETTER VIEW OF THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE MAIN GLACIER THAN SHACKLETON GOT AND CONSEQUENTLY HAVE OBSERVED A NUMBER OF PEAKS WHICH HE DID NOT NOTICE
3894-6552-0033 BUT ON THIS SURFACE OUR SLEDGES COULD NOT BE MORE HEAVILY LADEN THAN THEY ARE IN FACT WE HAVE NOT NEARLY ENOUGH RUNNER SURFACE AS IT IS MOREOVER THE SLEDGES ARE PACKED TOO HIGH AND THEREFORE CAPSIZE TOO EASILY
3894-6552-0034 I DO NOT THINK THE GLACIER CAN BE SO BROAD AS S SHOWS IT CERTAINLY THE SCENERY IS NOT NEARLY SO IMPRESSIVE AS THAT OF THE FERRAR BUT THERE ARE INTERESTING FEATURES SHOWING UP A DISTINCT BANDED STRUCTURE ON MOUNT ELIZABETH
3894-6552-0035 WHICH WE THINK MAY WELL BE A RECURRENCE OF THE BEACON SANDSTONE MORE BANDING ON THE COMMONWEALTH RANGE
3894-6552-0036 A SORT OF NIGHTLY LAND BREEZE THERE IS ALSO A VERY REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE IN TEMPERATURE BETWEEN DAY AND NIGHT
3894-6552-0037 AND WITHOUT HARD WORK WE WERE LITERALLY SOAKED THROUGH WITH PERSPIRATION
3894-6552-0038 EVANS PARTY KEPT UP MUCH BETTER TO DAY
3894-6552-0039 WE STARTED AT EIGHT THE PULLING TERRIBLY BAD THOUGH THE GLIDE DECIDEDLY GOOD A NEW CRUST IN PATCHES NOT SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE SKI BUT WITHOUT POSSIBILITY OF HOLD THEREFORE AS THE PULLERS GOT ON THE HARD PATCHES THEY SLIPPED BACK
3894-6552-0040 THE SLEDGES PLUNGED INTO THE SOFT PLACES AND STOPPED DEAD EVANS PARTY GOT AWAY FIRST WE FOLLOWED AND FOR SOME TIME HELPED THEM FORWARD AT THEIR STOPS BUT THIS PROVED ALTOGETHER TOO MUCH FOR US SO I FORGED AHEAD AND CAMPED AT ONE P M AS THE OTHERS WERE FAR ASTERN
3894-6552-0041 AND WE SPENT THREE HOURS IN SECURING THEM THERE WAS NO DELAY ON ACCOUNT OF THE SLOW PROGRESS OF THE OTHER PARTIES EVANS PASSED US AND FOR SOME TIME WENT FORWARD FAIRLY WELL UP A DECIDED SLOPE THE SUN WAS SHINING ON THE SURFACE BY THIS TIME
3894-6552-0042 BOWERS STARTED AFTER EVANS AND IT WAS EASY TO SEE THE REALLY TERRIBLE STATE OF AFFAIRS WITH THEM
3894-6552-0043 EVIDENTLY THE GLIDE HAD VANISHED WHEN WE GOT AWAY WE SOON DISCOVERED HOW AWFUL THE SURFACE HAD BECOME
3894-6552-0044 WE GOT OUR LOAD ALONG SOON PASSING BOWERS BUT THE TOIL WAS SIMPLY AWFUL WE WERE SOAKED WITH PERSPIRATION AND THOROUGHLY BREATHLESS WITH OUR EFFORTS AGAIN AND AGAIN THE SLEDGE GOT ONE RUNNER ON HARDER SNOW THAN THE OTHER CANTED ON ITS SIDE AND REFUSED TO MOVE
3894-6552-0045 AT THE TOP OF THE RISE I FOUND EVANS REDUCED TO RELAY WORK AND BOWERS FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE SOON AFTER WE GOT OUR WHOLE LOAD THROUGH TILL SEVEN P M CAMPING TIME BUT ONLY WITH REPEATED HALTS AND LABOUR WHICH WAS ALTOGETHER TOO STRENUOUS
3894-6552-0046 BUT WE MUST TRY AGAIN TO MORROW I SUPPOSE WE HAVE ADVANCED A BARE FOUR MILES TO DAY AND THE ASPECT OF THINGS IS VERY LITTLE CHANGED OUR HEIGHT IS NOW ABOUT ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET
3894-6552-0047 BUT IT LOOKS AS THOUGH MATTERS WERE GETTING WORSE INSTEAD OF BETTER
3894-6552-0048 WE CAN BUT TOIL ON BUT IT IS WOEFULLY DISHEARTENING
3894-6552-0049 I FIND OUR SUMMIT RATION IS EVEN TOO FILLING FOR THE PRESENT TWO SKUAS CAME ROUND THE CAMP AT LUNCH NO DOUBT ATTRACTED BY OUR SHAMBLES CAMP
3894-6552-0050 AND THE EXCEPTIONAL EXERCISE GIVES BAD ATTACKS OF CRAMP OUR LIPS ARE GETTING RAW AND BLISTERED THE EYES OF THE PARTY ARE IMPROVING I AM GLAD TO SAY WE ARE JUST STARTING OUR MARCH WITH NO VERY HOPEFUL OUTLOOK
3894-6552-0051 EVENING HEIGHT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FEET EVANS PARTY STARTED FIRST THIS MORNING
3894-6552-0052 WE SOON CAUGHT THE OTHERS AND OFFERED TO TAKE ON MORE WEIGHT BUT EVANS PRIDE WOULDN'T ALLOW SUCH HELP LATER IN THE MORNING WE EXCHANGED SLEDGES WITH BOWERS PULLED THEIRS EASILY WHILST THEY MADE QUITE HEAVY WORK WITH OURS
3894-6552-0053 ARE THE WEAKNESS OF THAT TEAM THOUGH BOTH PUT THEIR UTMOST INTO THE TRACES
3894-6552-0054 WE MUST HAVE COME ELEVEN OR TWELVE MILES STAT WE GOT FEARFULLY HOT ON THE MARCH SWEATED THROUGH EVERYTHING AND STRIPPED OFF JERSEYS THE RESULT IS WE ARE PRETTY COLD AND CLAMMY NOW
3894-6552-0055 BUT ESCAPE FROM THE SOFT SNOW AND A GOOD MARCH COMPENSATE EVERY DISCOMFORT AT LUNCH THE BLUE ICE WAS ABOUT TWO FEET BENEATH US
3894-6552-0056 TO NIGHT THE SKY IS OVERCAST AND WIND HAS BEEN BLOWING UP THE GLACIER
3894-6552-0057 THERE ARE CREVASSES ABOUT ONE ABOUT EIGHTEEN INCHES ACROSS OUTSIDE BOWERS TENT AND A NARROWER ONE OUTSIDE OUR OWN I THINK THE SOFT SNOW TROUBLE IS AT AN END AND I COULD WISH NOTHING BETTER THAN A CONTINUANCE OF THE PRESENT SURFACE
3894-6552-0058 TOWARDS THE END OF THE MARCH WE WERE PULLING OUR LOADS WITH THE GREATEST EASE
3894-6552-0059 THE CLOUDS EVER COMING LOWER AND EVANS IS NOW DECIDEDLY THE SLOWEST UNIT THOUGH BOWERS IS NOT MUCH FASTER WE KEEP UP AND OVERHAUL EITHER WITHOUT DIFFICULTY IT WAS AN ENORMOUS RELIEF YESTERDAY TO GET STEADY GOING WITHOUT INVOLUNTARY STOPS
3894-6552-0060 BUT YESTERDAY AND THIS MORNING
3894-6552-0061 THE RUNNERS GOT TEMPORARILY STUCK THIS AFTERNOON FOR THE FIRST TIME WE COULD START BY GIVING ONE GOOD HEAVE TOGETHER
3894-6552-0062 OR DO ANY OTHER DESIRABLE TASK THIS IS A SECOND RELIEF FOR WHICH WE ARE MOST GRATEFUL AT THE LUNCH CAMP THE SNOW COVERING WAS LESS THAN A FOOT AND AT THIS IT IS A BARE NINE INCHES
3894-6552-0063 WE COULD SEE NOTHING AND THE PULLING GREW VERY HEAVY
3894-6552-0064 WE SHOULD HAVE DONE A GOOD MARCH TO DAY AS IT IS WE HAVE COVERED ABOUT ELEVEN MILES STAT
3894-6552-0065 PRAY HEAVEN WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THIS WRETCHED SNOW IN THE WORST PART OF THE GLACIER TO COME THE LOWER PART OF THIS GLACIER IS NOT VERY INTERESTING EXCEPT FROM AN ICE POINT OF VIEW EXCEPT MOUNT KYFFEN LITTLE BARE ROCK IS VISIBLE AND ITS STRUCTURE AT THIS DISTANCE IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE
3894-6552-0066 THERE ARE NO MORAINES ON THE SURFACE OF THE GLACIER EITHER
3894-6552-0067 THOUGH THEY DO NOT ENTER AT GRADE
3894-6552-0068 BUT THE SOUTHERN STEEP FACES ARE NEARLY BARE EVIDENTLY THE SUN GETS A GOOD HOLD ON THEM THERE MUST BE A GOOD DEAL OF MELTING AND ROCK WEATHERING
