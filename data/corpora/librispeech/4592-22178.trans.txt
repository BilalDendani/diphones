4592-22178-0000 THEY HAD EVIDENTLY BOTH FORMED THE SAME RESOLUTION THE EYES OF BOTH SHONE WITH SATISFACTION AND A CONFESSION
4592-22178-0001 DO YOU TAKE VODKA COUNT ASKED PRINCESS MARY AND THOSE WORDS SUDDENLY BANISHED THE SHADOWS OF THE PAST
4592-22178-0002 YES REPLIED PIERRE WITH THE SMILE OF MILD IRONY NOW HABITUAL TO HIM THEY EVEN TELL ME WONDERS I MYSELF NEVER DREAMED OF
4592-22178-0003 IN GENERAL I HAVE NOTICED THAT IT IS VERY EASY TO BE AN INTERESTING MAN I AM AN INTERESTING MAN NOW PEOPLE INVITE ME OUT AND TELL ME ALL ABOUT MYSELF NATASHA SMILED AND WAS ON THE POINT OF SPEAKING WE HAVE BEEN TOLD PRINCESS MARY INTERRUPTED HER
4592-22178-0004 THAT YOU LOST TWO MILLIONS IN MOSCOW IS THAT TRUE BUT I AM THREE TIMES AS RICH AS BEFORE RETURNED PIERRE THOUGH THE POSITION WAS NOW ALTERED BY HIS DECISION TO PAY HIS WIFE'S DEBTS AND TO REBUILD HIS HOUSES
4592-22178-0005 WHAT I HAVE CERTAINLY GAINED IS FREEDOM HE BEGAN SERIOUSLY
4592-22178-0006 WE WERE NOT AN EXEMPLARY COUPLE HE ADDED QUICKLY GLANCING AT NATASHA AND NOTICING ON HER FACE CURIOSITY AS TO HOW HE WOULD SPEAK OF HIS WIFE BUT HER DEATH SHOCKED ME TERRIBLY
4592-22178-0007 WHEN TWO PEOPLE QUARREL THEY ARE ALWAYS BOTH IN FAULT AND ONE'S OWN GUILT SUDDENLY BECOMES TERRIBLY SERIOUS WHEN THE OTHER IS NO LONGER ALIVE AND THEN SUCH A DEATH WITHOUT FRIENDS AND WITHOUT CONSOLATION I AM VERY VERY SORRY FOR HER HE CONCLUDED
4592-22178-0008 AND WAS PLEASED TO NOTICE A LOOK OF GLAD APPROVAL ON NATASHA'S FACE YES AND SO YOU ARE ONCE MORE AN ELIGIBLE BACHELOR SAID PRINCESS MARY PIERRE SUDDENLY FLUSHED CRIMSON AND FOR A LONG TIME TRIED NOT TO LOOK AT NATASHA
4592-22178-0009 WHEN HE VENTURED TO GLANCE HER WAY AGAIN HER FACE WAS COLD STERN AND HE FANCIED EVEN CONTEMPTUOUS AND DID YOU REALLY SEE AND SPEAK TO NAPOLEON AS WE HAVE BEEN TOLD SAID PRINCESS MARY PIERRE LAUGHED NO NOT ONCE
4592-22178-0010 EVERYBODY SEEMS TO IMAGINE THAT BEING TAKEN PRISONER MEANS BEING NAPOLEON'S GUEST NOT ONLY DID I NEVER SEE HIM BUT I HEARD NOTHING ABOUT HIM I WAS IN MUCH LOWER COMPANY SUPPER WAS OVER AND PIERRE WHO AT FIRST DECLINED TO SPEAK ABOUT HIS CAPTIVITY WAS GRADUALLY LED ON TO DO SO
4592-22178-0011 PIERRE ADMITTED THAT IT WAS TRUE AND FROM THAT WAS GRADUALLY LED BY PRINCESS MARY'S QUESTIONS AND ESPECIALLY BY NATASHA'S INTO GIVING A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HIS ADVENTURES AT FIRST HE SPOKE WITH THE AMUSED AND MILD IRONY NOW CUSTOMARY WITH HIM TOWARD EVERYBODY
4592-22178-0012 AND ESPECIALLY TOWARD HIMSELF BUT WHEN HE CAME TO DESCRIBE THE HORRORS AND SUFFERINGS HE HAD WITNESSED HE WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY CARRIED AWAY AND BEGAN SPEAKING WITH THE SUPPRESSED EMOTION OF A MAN RE EXPERIENCING IN RECOLLECTION STRONG IMPRESSIONS HE HAS LIVED THROUGH
4592-22178-0013 WATCHED PIERRE WITH AN ATTENTION THAT NEVER WANDERED EVIDENTLY HERSELF EXPERIENCING ALL THAT HE DESCRIBED NOT ONLY HER LOOK BUT HER EXCLAMATIONS AND THE BRIEF QUESTIONS SHE PUT SHOWED PIERRE THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD JUST WHAT HE WISHED TO CONVEY
4592-22178-0014 IT WAS CLEAR THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD NOT ONLY WHAT HE SAID BUT ALSO WHAT HE WISHED TO BUT COULD NOT EXPRESS IN WORDS THE ACCOUNT PIERRE GAVE OF THE INCIDENT WITH THE CHILD AND THE WOMAN FOR PROTECTING WHOM HE WAS ARRESTED WAS THIS IT WAS AN AWFUL SIGHT
4592-22178-0015 SOMETHING FINE PIERRE CONTINUED WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE EXECUTION HE WANTED TO PASS OVER THE HORRIBLE DETAILS BUT NATASHA INSISTED THAT HE SHOULD NOT OMIT ANYTHING PIERRE BEGAN TO TELL ABOUT KARATAEV BUT PAUSED
4592-22178-0016 BY THIS TIME HE HAD RISEN FROM THE TABLE AND WAS PACING THE ROOM NATASHA FOLLOWING HIM WITH HER EYES THEN HE ADDED NO YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I LEARNED FROM THAT ILLITERATE MAN THAT SIMPLE FELLOW YES YES GO ON SAID NATASHA WHERE IS HE
4592-22178-0017 THEY KILLED HIM ALMOST BEFORE MY EYES AND PIERRE HIS VOICE TREMBLING CONTINUALLY WENT ON TO TELL OF THE LAST DAYS OF THEIR RETREAT OF KARATAEV'S ILLNESS AND HIS DEATH HE TOLD OF HIS ADVENTURES AS HE HAD NEVER YET RECALLED THEM
4592-22178-0018 HE NOW AS IT WERE SAW A NEW MEANING IN ALL HE HAD GONE THROUGH NOW THAT HE WAS TELLING IT ALL TO NATASHA HE EXPERIENCED THAT PLEASURE WHICH A MAN HAS WHEN WOMEN LISTEN TO HIM
4592-22178-0019 NOT CLEVER WOMEN WHO WHEN LISTENING EITHER TRY TO REMEMBER WHAT THEY HEAR TO ENRICH THEIR MINDS AND WHEN OPPORTUNITY OFFERS TO RETELL IT OR WHO WISH TO ADOPT IT TO SOME THOUGHT OF THEIR OWN AND
4592-22178-0020 PROMPTLY CONTRIBUTE THEIR OWN CLEVER COMMENTS PREPARED IN THEIR LITTLE MENTAL WORKSHOP BUT THE PLEASURE GIVEN BY REAL WOMEN GIFTED WITH A CAPACITY TO SELECT AND ABSORB THE VERY BEST A MAN SHOWS OF HIMSELF NATASHA WITHOUT KNOWING IT WAS ALL ATTENTION
4592-22178-0021 SHE DID NOT LOSE A WORD NO SINGLE QUIVER IN PIERRE'S VOICE NO LOOK NO TWITCH OF A MUSCLE IN HIS FACE NOR A SINGLE GESTURE SHE CAUGHT THE UNFINISHED WORD IN ITS FLIGHT AND TOOK IT STRAIGHT INTO HER OPEN HEART DIVINING THE SECRET MEANING OF ALL PIERRE'S MENTAL TRAVAIL
4592-22178-0022 PRINCESS MARY UNDERSTOOD HIS STORY AND SYMPATHIZED WITH HIM BUT SHE NOW SAW SOMETHING ELSE THAT ABSORBED ALL HER ATTENTION SHE SAW THE POSSIBILITY OF LOVE AND HAPPINESS BETWEEN NATASHA AND PIERRE AND THE FIRST THOUGHT OF THIS FILLED HER HEART WITH GLADNESS
4592-22178-0023 IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE FOOTMEN CAME IN WITH SAD AND STERN FACES TO CHANGE THE CANDLES BUT NO ONE NOTICED THEM PIERRE FINISHED HIS STORY NATASHA CONTINUED TO LOOK AT HIM INTENTLY WITH BRIGHT ATTENTIVE AND ANIMATED EYES
4592-22178-0024 AS IF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING MORE WHICH HE HAD PERHAPS LEFT UNTOLD PIERRE IN SHAMEFACED AND HAPPY CONFUSION GLANCED OCCASIONALLY AT HER AND TRIED TO THINK WHAT TO SAY NEXT TO INTRODUCE A FRESH SUBJECT PRINCESS MARY WAS SILENT
4592-22178-0025 IT OCCURRED TO NONE OF THEM THAT IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK AND TIME TO GO TO BED PEOPLE SPEAK OF MISFORTUNES AND SUFFERINGS REMARKED PIERRE BUT IF AT THIS MOMENT I WERE ASKED WOULD YOU RATHER BE WHAT YOU WERE BEFORE YOU WERE TAKEN PRISONER
4592-22178-0026 WE IMAGINE THAT WHEN WE ARE THROWN OUT OF OUR USUAL RUTS ALL IS LOST BUT IT IS ONLY THEN THAT WHAT IS NEW AND GOOD BEGINS WHILE THERE IS LIFE THERE IS HAPPINESS THERE IS MUCH MUCH BEFORE US I SAY THIS TO YOU HE ADDED TURNING TO NATASHA YES
4592-22178-0027 YES SHE SAID ANSWERING SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
4592-22178-0028 PIERRE LOOKED INTENTLY AT HER YES AND NOTHING MORE SAID NATASHA IT'S NOT TRUE NOT TRUE CRIED PIERRE I AM NOT TO BLAME FOR BEING ALIVE AND WISHING TO LIVE NOR YOU EITHER
4592-22178-0029 SUDDENLY NATASHA BENT HER HEAD COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDS AND BEGAN TO CRY WHAT IS IT NATASHA SAID PRINCESS MARY NOTHING NOTHING SHE SMILED AT PIERRE THROUGH HER TEARS GOOD NIGHT IT IS TIME FOR BED PIERRE ROSE AND TOOK HIS LEAVE
4592-22178-0030 THEY TALKED OF WHAT PIERRE HAD TOLD THEM PRINCESS MARY DID NOT EXPRESS HER OPINION OF PIERRE NOR DID NATASHA SPEAK OF HIM WELL GOOD NIGHT MARY SAID NATASHA DO YOU KNOW
4592-22178-0031 SHE MEANT PRINCE ANDREW FOR FEAR OF NOT DOING JUSTICE TO OUR FEELINGS WE FORGET HIM PRINCESS MARY SIGHED DEEPLY AND THEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED THE JUSTICE OF NATASHA'S REMARK BUT SHE DID NOT EXPRESS AGREEMENT IN WORDS IS IT POSSIBLE TO FORGET
4592-22178-0032 GOOD VERY GOOD SAID NATASHA I AM SURE HE REALLY LOVED HIM
4592-22178-0033 NATASHA SUDDENLY SAID WITH A MISCHIEVOUS SMILE SUCH AS PRINCESS MARY HAD NOT SEEN ON HER FACE FOR A LONG TIME HE HAS SOMEHOW GROWN SO CLEAN SMOOTH AND FRESH AS IF HE HAD
4592-22178-0034 JUST COME OUT OF A RUSSIAN BATH DO YOU UNDERSTAND OUT OF A MORAL BATH ISN'T IT TRUE YES REPLIED PRINCESS MARY HE HAS GREATLY IMPROVED WITH A SHORT COAT AND HIS HAIR CROPPED
4592-22178-0035 JUST AS IF WELL JUST AS IF HE HAD COME STRAIGHT FROM THE BATH PAPA USED TO
4592-22178-0036 LIKED NO ONE SO MUCH AS HIM SAID PRINCESS MARY YES AND YET HE IS QUITE DIFFERENT THEY SAY MEN ARE FRIENDS WHEN THEY ARE QUITE DIFFERENT THAT MUST BE TRUE REALLY HE IS QUITE UNLIKE HIM IN EVERYTHING YES BUT HE'S WONDERFUL
