5132-33409-0011 SOMETIMES THERE WERE TWO OR THREE MEN OF THE SAME NAME IN A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT CAUSED TROUBLE PEOPLE THOUGHT OF TWO WAYS OF MAKING IT EASY TO TELL WHICH MAN WAS BEING SPOKEN OF EACH WAS GIVEN A NICKNAME SUPPOSE
5132-33409-0012 ONE WOULD BE CALLED HAKI THE BLACK BECAUSE HE HAD BLACK HAIR THE OTHER WOULD BE CALLED HAKI THE SHIP CHESTED BECAUSE HIS CHEST WAS BROAD AND STRONG THESE NICKNAMES WERE OFTEN GIVEN ONLY FOR THE FUN OF IT

5132-33409-0024 AND THE DRINKING HORNS WENT ROUND IN A CLEAN ROOM BEDS AROUND THE SIDES OF THE FEAST HALL WERE SHUT BEDS THEY WERE LIKE BIG BOXES WITH DOORS OPENING INTO THE HALL
5132-33409-0025 ON THE FLOOR OF THIS BOX WAS STRAW WITH BLANKETS THROWN OVER IT
5132-33409-0026 AND SO SHUT THEMSELVES IN OLAF'S MEN

5132-33409-0045 SOMETIMES DURING THE FIGHT A MAN WOULD THINK THAT HE SAW THE VALKYRIAS
5132-33409-0046 AN OLD NORSE STORY SAYS
