37-225-0000 HIS DEPARTURE GAVE CATHERINE THE FIRST EXPERIMENTAL CONVICTION THAT A LOSS MAY BE SOMETIMES A GAIN THE HAPPINESS WITH WHICH THEIR TIME NOW PASSED EVERY EMPLOYMENT VOLUNTARY EVERY LAUGH INDULGED
37-225-0001 RESTRAINT WHICH THE GENERAL'S PRESENCE HAD IMPOSED AND MOST THANKFULLY FEEL THEIR PRESENT RELEASE FROM IT SUCH EASE AND SUCH DELIGHTS MADE HER LOVE THE PLACE AND THE PEOPLE MORE AND MORE EVERY DAY
37-225-0002 AND AN APPREHENSION OF NOT BEING EQUALLY BELOVED BY THE OTHER SHE WOULD AT EACH MOMENT OF EACH DAY HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY HAPPY BUT SHE WAS NOW IN THE FOURTH WEEK OF HER VISIT BEFORE THE GENERAL CAME HOME
37-225-0003 THE FOURTH WEEK WOULD BE TURNED AND PERHAPS IT MIGHT SEEM AN INTRUSION IF SHE STAYED MUCH LONGER THIS WAS A PAINFUL CONSIDERATION WHENEVER IT OCCURRED AND EAGER TO GET RID OF SUCH A WEIGHT ON HER MIND SHE VERY SOON RESOLVED TO SPEAK TO ELEANOR ABOUT IT AT ONCE
37-225-0004 PROPOSE GOING AWAY AND BE GUIDED IN HER CONDUCT BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HER PROPOSAL MIGHT BE TAKEN AWARE THAT IF SHE GAVE HERSELF MUCH TIME SHE MIGHT FEEL IT DIFFICULT TO BRING FORWARD SO UNPLEASANT A SUBJECT
37-225-0005 TO START FORTH HER OBLIGATION OF GOING AWAY VERY SOON ELEANOR LOOKED AND DECLARED HERSELF MUCH CONCERNED SHE HAD HOPED FOR THE PLEASURE OF HER COMPANY FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME HAD BEEN MISLED PERHAPS BY HER WISHES
37-225-0006 AND COULD NOT BUT THINK THAT IF MISTER AND MISSUS MORLAND WERE AWARE OF THE PLEASURE IT WAS TO HER TO HAVE HER THERE THEY WOULD BE TOO GENEROUS TO HASTEN HER RETURN CATHERINE EXPLAINED OH AS TO THAT
37-225-0007 PAPA AND MAMMA WERE IN NO HURRY AT ALL AS LONG AS SHE WAS HAPPY THEY WOULD ALWAYS BE SATISFIED THEN WHY MIGHT SHE ASK
37-225-0008 OH BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN THERE SO LONG NAY IF YOU CAN USE SUCH A WORD I CAN URGE YOU NO FARTHER IF YOU THINK IT LONG OH NO I DO NOT INDEED
37-225-0009 TILL SHE HAD HER LEAVING THEM WAS NOT EVEN TO BE THOUGHT OF IN HAVING THIS CAUSE OF UNEASINESS SO PLEASANTLY REMOVED THE FORCE OF THE OTHER WAS LIKEWISE WEAKENED THE KINDNESS THE EARNESTNESS OF ELEANOR'S MANNER IN PRESSING HER TO STAY
37-225-0010 AND HENRY'S GRATIFIED LOOK ON BEING TOLD THAT HER STAY WAS DETERMINED
37-225-0011 AS LEFT HER ONLY JUST SO MUCH SOLICITUDE AS THE HUMAN MIND CAN NEVER DO COMFORTABLY WITHOUT SHE DID ALMOST ALWAYS
37-225-0012 AND BELIEVING SO FAR HER DOUBTS AND ANXIETIES WERE MERELY SPORTIVE IRRITATIONS HENRY WAS NOT ABLE TO OBEY HIS FATHER'S INJUNCTION OF REMAINING WHOLLY AT NORTHANGER IN ATTENDANCE ON THE LADIES DURING HIS ABSENCE IN LONDON
37-225-0013 THE ENGAGEMENTS OF HIS CURATE AT WOODSTON OBLIGING HIM TO LEAVE THEM ON SATURDAY
37-225-0014 HIS LOSS WAS NOT NOW WHAT IT HAD BEEN WHILE THE GENERAL WAS AT HOME
37-225-0015 BUT DID NOT RUIN THEIR COMFORT
37-225-0016 FOUND THEMSELVES SO WELL SUFFICIENT FOR THE TIME TO THEMSELVES THAT IT WAS ELEVEN O'CLOCK RATHER A LATE HOUR AT THE ABBEY BEFORE THEY QUITTED THE SUPPER ROOM ON THE DAY OF HENRY'S DEPARTURE THEY HAD JUST REACHED THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS WHEN IT SEEMED
37-225-0017 AS FAR AS THE THICKNESS OF THE WALLS WOULD ALLOW THEM TO JUDGE THAT A CARRIAGE WAS DRIVING UP TO THE DOOR AND THE NEXT MOMENT CONFIRMED THE IDEA BY THE LOUD NOISE OF THE HOUSE BELL AFTER THE FIRST PERTURBATION OF SURPRISE HAD PASSED AWAY
37-225-0018 IN A GOOD HEAVEN WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER IT WAS QUICKLY DECIDED BY ELEANOR TO BE HER ELDEST BROTHER WHOSE ARRIVAL WAS OFTEN AS SUDDEN IF NOT QUITE SO UNSEASONABLE AND ACCORDINGLY SHE HURRIED DOWN TO WELCOME HIM
37-225-0019 CATHERINE WALKED ON TO HER CHAMBER MAKING UP HER MIND AS WELL AS SHE COULD TO A FURTHER ACQUAINTANCE WITH CAPTAIN TILNEY AND COMFORTING HERSELF UNDER THE UNPLEASANT IMPRESSION HIS CONDUCT HAD GIVEN HER
37-225-0020 TO APPROVE OF HER THAT AT LEAST THEY SHOULD NOT MEET UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AS WOULD MAKE THEIR MEETING MATERIALLY PAINFUL SHE TRUSTED HE WOULD NEVER SPEAK OF MISS THORPE AND INDEED AS HE MUST BY THIS TIME BE ASHAMED OF THE PART HE HAD ACTED
37-225-0021 THERE COULD BE NO DANGER OF IT AND AS LONG AS ALL MENTION OF BATH SCENES WERE AVOIDED SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD BEHAVE TO HIM VERY CIVILLY IN SUCH CONSIDERATIONS TIME PASSED AWAY
37-225-0022 AT THAT MOMENT CATHERINE THOUGHT SHE HEARD HER STEP IN THE GALLERY AND LISTENED FOR ITS CONTINUANCE BUT ALL WAS SILENT SCARCELY HOWEVER HAD SHE CONVICTED HER FANCY OF ERROR WHEN THE NOISE OF SOMETHING MOVING CLOSE TO HER DOOR MADE HER START
37-225-0023 IT SEEMED AS IF SOMEONE WAS TOUCHING THE VERY DOORWAY AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT A SLIGHT MOTION OF THE LOCK PROVED THAT SOME HAND MUST BE ON IT SHE TREMBLED A LITTLE AT THE IDEA OF ANYONE'S APPROACHING SO CAUTIOUSLY
37-225-0024 BUT RESOLVING NOT TO BE AGAIN OVERCOME BY TRIVIAL APPEARANCES OF ALARM OR MISLED BY A RAISED IMAGINATION SHE STEPPED QUIETLY FORWARD AND OPENED THE DOOR ELEANOR AND ONLY ELEANOR STOOD THERE
37-225-0025 CATHERINE'S SPIRITS HOWEVER WERE TRANQUILLIZED BUT FOR AN INSTANT
37-225-0026 THOUGH EVIDENTLY INTENDING TO COME IN
37-225-0027 AND A STILL GREATER TO SPEAK WHEN THERE CATHERINE SUPPOSING SOME UNEASINESS ON CAPTAIN TILNEY'S ACCOUNT COULD ONLY EXPRESS HER CONCERN BY SILENT ATTENTION OBLIGED HER TO BE SEATED RUBBED HER TEMPLES WITH LAVENDER WATER
37-225-0028 AND HUNG OVER HER WITH AFFECTIONATE SOLICITUDE MY DEAR CATHERINE YOU MUST NOT YOU MUST NOT INDEED WERE ELEANOR'S FIRST CONNECTED WORDS I AM QUITE WELL THIS KINDNESS DISTRACTS ME
37-225-0029 I CANNOT BEAR IT I COME TO YOU ON SUCH AN ERRAND ERRAND TO ME HOW SHALL I TELL YOU OH HOW SHALL I TELL YOU A NEW IDEA NOW DARTED INTO CATHERINE'S MIND
37-225-0030 AND TURNING AS PALE AS HER FRIEND SHE EXCLAIMED TIS A MESSENGER FROM WOODSTON YOU ARE MISTAKEN INDEED RETURNED ELEANOR LOOKING AT HER MOST COMPASSIONATELY IT IS NO ONE FROM WOODSTON IT IS MY FATHER HIMSELF
37-225-0031 HER VOICE FALTERED AND HER EYES WERE TURNED TO THE GROUND AS SHE MENTIONED HIS NAME HIS UNLOOKED FOR RETURN WAS ENOUGH IN ITSELF TO MAKE CATHERINE'S HEART SINK
37-225-0032 WORSE TO BE TOLD SHE SAID NOTHING AND ELEANOR ENDEAVOURING TO COLLECT HERSELF AND SPEAK WITH FIRMNESS BUT WITH EYES STILL CAST DOWN SOON WENT ON YOU ARE TOO GOOD I AM SURE
37-225-0033 TO THINK THE WORSE OF ME FOR THE PART I AM OBLIGED TO PERFORM I AM INDEED A MOST UNWILLING MESSENGER AFTER WHAT HAS SO LATELY PASSED SO LATELY BEEN SETTLED BETWEEN US HOW JOYFULLY HOW THANKFULLY ON MY SIDE
37-225-0034 AS TO YOUR CONTINUING HERE AS I HOPED FOR MANY MANY WEEKS LONGER HOW CAN I TELL YOU THAT YOUR KINDNESS IS NOT TO BE ACCEPTED AND THAT THE HAPPINESS YOUR COMPANY HAS HITHERTO GIVEN US IS TO BE REPAID BY
37-225-0035 BUT I MUST NOT TRUST MYSELF WITH WORDS MY DEAR CATHERINE WE ARE TO PART MY FATHER HAS RECOLLECTED AN ENGAGEMENT THAT TAKES OUR WHOLE FAMILY AWAY ON MONDAY WE ARE GOING TO LORD LONGTOWN'S NEAR HEREFORD FOR A FORTNIGHT
37-225-0036 MY DEAR ELEANOR CRIED CATHERINE SUPPRESSING HER FEELINGS AS WELL AS SHE COULD DO NOT BE SO DISTRESSED A SECOND ENGAGEMENT MUST GIVE WAY TO A FIRST

37-225-0040 BUT HOW CAN I TELL YOU TOMORROW MORNING IS FIXED FOR YOUR LEAVING US
37-225-0041 THE VERY CARRIAGE IS ORDERED AND WILL BE HERE AT SEVEN O'CLOCK AND NO SERVANT WILL BE OFFERED YOU CATHERINE SAT DOWN BREATHLESS AND SPEECHLESS I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE MY SENSES WHEN I HEARD IT
37-225-0042 EVEN OF DECENT CIVILITY DEAR DEAR CATHERINE IN BEING THE BEARER OF SUCH A MESSAGE I SEEM GUILTY MYSELF OF ALL ITS INSULT YET
37-225-0043 I TRUST YOU WILL ACQUIT ME FOR YOU MUST HAVE BEEN LONG ENOUGH IN THIS HOUSE TO SEE THAT I AM BUT A NOMINAL MISTRESS OF IT THAT MY REAL POWER IS NOTHING HAVE I OFFENDED THE GENERAL SAID CATHERINE IN A FALTERING VOICE
37-225-0044 ALL THAT I KNOW ALL THAT I ANSWER FOR IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE GIVEN HIM NO JUST CAUSE OF OFFENCE HE CERTAINLY IS GREATLY VERY GREATLY DISCOMPOSED I HAVE SELDOM SEEN HIM MORE SO HIS TEMPER IS NOT HAPPY
37-225-0045 I AM VERY SORRY IF I HAVE OFFENDED HIM IT WAS THE LAST THING I WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE DONE BUT DO NOT BE UNHAPPY ELEANOR AN ENGAGEMENT YOU KNOW MUST BE KEPT I AM ONLY SORRY IT WAS NOT RECOLLECTED SOONER THAT I MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN HOME
37-225-0046 BUT IT IS OF VERY LITTLE CONSEQUENCE I HOPE I EARNESTLY HOPE THAT TO YOUR REAL SAFETY IT WILL BE OF NONE BUT TO EVERYTHING ELSE IT IS OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE TO COMFORT APPEARANCE PROPRIETY
37-225-0047 TO YOUR FAMILY TO THE WORLD WERE YOUR FRIENDS THE ALLENS STILL IN BATH YOU MIGHT GO TO THEM WITH COMPARATIVE EASE A FEW HOURS WOULD TAKE YOU THERE BUT A JOURNEY OF SEVENTY MILES TO BE TAKEN POST BY YOU AT YOUR AGE ALONE UNATTENDED
37-225-0048 YOU KNOW MAKES NO DIFFERENCE I CAN BE READY BY SEVEN LET ME BE CALLED IN TIME
37-225-0049 NOW LEFT HER WITH I SHALL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING CATHERINE'S SWELLING HEART NEEDED RELIEF IN ELEANOR'S PRESENCE FRIENDSHIP AND PRIDE HAD EQUALLY RESTRAINED HER TEARS BUT NO SOONER WAS SHE GONE THAN THEY BURST FORTH IN TORRENTS
37-225-0050 TURNED FROM THE HOUSE AND IN SUCH A WAY
37-225-0051 WHO COULD SAY WHEN THEY MIGHT MEET AGAIN AND ALL THIS BY SUCH A MAN AS GENERAL TILNEY SO POLITE SO WELL BRED AND HERETOFORE SO PARTICULARLY FOND OF HER IT WAS AS INCOMPREHENSIBLE AS IT WAS MORTIFYING AND GRIEVOUS
37-225-0052 FROM WHAT IT COULD ARISE AND WHERE IT WOULD END WERE CONSIDERATIONS OF EQUAL PERPLEXITY AND ALARM THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS DONE SO GROSSLY UNCIVIL HURRYING HER AWAY WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE TO HER OWN CONVENIENCE
37-225-0053 OR ALLOWING HER EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF CHOICE AS TO THE TIME OR MODE OF HER TRAVELLING OF TWO DAYS THE EARLIEST FIXED ON AND OF THAT ALMOST THE EARLIEST HOUR AS IF RESOLVED TO HAVE HER GONE BEFORE HE WAS STIRRING IN THE MORNING
37-225-0054 THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE OBLIGED EVEN TO SEE HER WHAT COULD ALL THIS MEAN BUT AN INTENTIONAL AFFRONT BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER SHE MUST HAVE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO OFFEND HIM ELEANOR HAD WISHED TO SPARE HER FROM SO PAINFUL A NOTION
37-225-0055 BUT CATHERINE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT POSSIBLE THAT ANY INJURY OR ANY MISFORTUNE COULD PROVOKE SUCH ILL WILL AGAINST A PERSON NOT CONNECTED OR AT LEAST
37-225-0056 HEAVILY PASSED THE NIGHT SLEEP OR REPOSE THAT DESERVED THE NAME OF SLEEP WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT ROOM IN WHICH HER DISTURBED IMAGINATION HAD TORMENTED HER ON HER FIRST ARRIVAL
37-225-0057 HER ANXIETY HAD FOUNDATION IN FACT HER FEARS IN PROBABILITY AND WITH A MIND SO OCCUPIED IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF ACTUAL AND NATURAL EVIL THE SOLITUDE OF HER SITUATION THE DARKNESS OF HER CHAMBER THE ANTIQUITY OF THE BUILDING
37-225-0058 WERE FELT AND CONSIDERED WITHOUT THE SMALLEST EMOTION AND THOUGH THE WIND WAS HIGH AND OFTEN PRODUCED STRANGE AND SUDDEN NOISES THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE SHE HEARD IT ALL AS SHE LAY AWAKE HOUR AFTER HOUR WITHOUT CURIOSITY OR TERROR
37-225-0059 SOON AFTER SIX ELEANOR ENTERED HER ROOM EAGER TO SHOW ATTENTION OR GIVE ASSISTANCE WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE BUT VERY LITTLE REMAINED TO BE DONE
37-225-0060 THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME CONCILIATORY MESSAGE FROM THE GENERAL OCCURRED TO HER AS HIS DAUGHTER APPEARED
37-225-0061 AND SHE ONLY WANTED TO KNOW HOW FAR AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED AN APOLOGY MIGHT PROPERLY BE RECEIVED BY HER BUT THE KNOWLEDGE WOULD HAVE BEEN USELESS HERE IT WAS NOT CALLED FOR
37-225-0062 ELEANOR BROUGHT NO MESSAGE VERY LITTLE PASSED BETWEEN THEM ON MEETING
37-225-0063 AND FEW AND TRIVIAL WERE THE SENTENCES EXCHANGED WHILE THEY REMAINED UPSTAIRS CATHERINE IN BUSY AGITATION COMPLETING HER DRESS AND ELEANOR WITH MORE GOODWILL THAN EXPERIENCE INTENT UPON FILLING THE TRUNK WHEN EVERYTHING WAS DONE THEY LEFT THE ROOM
37-225-0064 CATHERINE LINGERING ONLY HALF A MINUTE BEHIND HER FRIEND TO THROW A PARTING GLANCE ON EVERY WELL KNOWN CHERISHED OBJECT AND WENT DOWN TO THE BREAKFAST PARLOUR WHERE BREAKFAST WAS PREPARED
37-225-0065 SHE TRIED TO EAT AS WELL TO SAVE HERSELF FROM THE PAIN OF BEING URGED AS TO MAKE HER FRIEND COMFORTABLE BUT SHE HAD NO APPETITE AND COULD NOT SWALLOW MANY MOUTHFULS THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THIS AND HER LAST BREAKFAST IN THAT ROOM GAVE HER FRESH MISERY
37-225-0066 AND STRENGTHENED HER DISTASTE FOR EVERYTHING BEFORE HER
37-225-0067 STRIKING AT THAT INSTANT ON HER MIND WITH PECULIAR FORCE
37-225-0068 ELEANOR SEEMED NOW IMPELLED INTO RESOLUTION AND SPEECH YOU MUST WRITE TO ME CATHERINE SHE CRIED YOU MUST LET ME HEAR FROM YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TILL I KNOW YOU TO BE SAFE AT HOME I SHALL NOT HAVE AN HOUR'S COMFORT
37-225-0069 FOR ONE LETTER AT ALL RISKS ALL HAZARDS I MUST ENTREAT
37-225-0070 AND THEN TILL I CAN ASK FOR YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AS I OUGHT TO DO I WILL NOT EXPECT MORE DIRECT TO ME AT LORD LONGTOWN'S AND I MUST ASK IT UNDER COVER TO ALICE NO ELEANOR
37-225-0071 I WILL TRUST TO YOUR OWN KINDNESS OF HEART WHEN I AM AT A DISTANCE FROM YOU BUT THIS WITH THE LOOK OF SORROW ACCOMPANYING IT WAS ENOUGH TO MELT CATHERINE'S PRIDE IN A MOMENT AND SHE INSTANTLY SAID OH ELEANOR I WILL WRITE TO YOU INDEED
37-225-0072 THOUGH SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED IN SPEAKING OF IT HAD OCCURRED TO HER THAT AFTER SO LONG AN ABSENCE FROM HOME CATHERINE MIGHT NOT BE PROVIDED WITH MONEY ENOUGH FOR THE EXPENSES OF HER JOURNEY AND UPON SUGGESTING IT TO HER WITH MOST AFFECTIONATE OFFERS OF ACCOMMODATION
37-225-0073 IT PROVED TO BE EXACTLY THE CASE CATHERINE HAD NEVER THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT TILL THAT MOMENT BUT UPON EXAMINING HER PURSE WAS CONVINCED THAT BUT FOR THIS KINDNESS OF HER FRIEND SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TURNED FROM THE HOUSE WITHOUT EVEN THE MEANS OF GETTING HOME
37-225-0074 AND THE DISTRESS IN WHICH SHE MUST HAVE BEEN THEREBY INVOLVED FILLING THE MINDS OF BOTH SCARCELY ANOTHER WORD WAS SAID BY EITHER DURING THE TIME OF THEIR REMAINING TOGETHER SHORT HOWEVER WAS THAT TIME THE CARRIAGE WAS SOON ANNOUNCED TO BE READY
37-225-0075 AND CATHERINE INSTANTLY RISING A LONG AND AFFECTIONATE EMBRACE SUPPLIED THE PLACE OF LANGUAGE IN BIDDING EACH OTHER ADIEU AND AS THEY ENTERED THE HALL UNABLE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT SOME MENTION OF ONE WHOSE NAME HAD NOT YET BEEN SPOKEN BY EITHER
37-225-0076 SHE PAUSED A MOMENT AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS JUST MADE IT INTELLIGIBLE THAT SHE LEFT HER KIND REMEMBRANCE FOR HER ABSENT FRIEND
