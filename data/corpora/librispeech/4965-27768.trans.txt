4965-27768-0017 THERE WAS A MAN WITH THE SPLENDID PROFILE OF A ROMAN SENATOR DRESSED IN RAGS AND TATTERS
4965-27768-0018 HERE WERE THE UNBALANCED FACES OF THE CRIMINAL TYPE BUT LOOKING WITH A CONFIDENCE THAT NOTHING COULD SHAKE ALL THESE MEN IN SPITE OF THEIR APPARENT YOUTH EVIDENTLY POSSESSED A LARGE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE AN EASY MANNER A BOLD APPROACH
4965-27768-0019 AND SOME HIDDEN SUSPICIOUS CUNNING THE GENTLEMAN IN THE SANDY SUIT BOWED JUST HIS HEAD NEATLY AND EASILY AND SAID WITH A HALF QUESTION IN HIS VOICE MISTER CHAIRMAN YES I AM THE CHAIRMAN WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS
4965-27768-0020 THE GENTLEMAN BEGAN IN A QUIET VOICE AND TURNED ROUND TO INDICATE HIS COMPANIONS WE COME AS DELEGATES FROM THE UNITED ROSTOV KHARKOV AND ODESSA NIKOLAYEV ASSOCIATION OF THIEVES

4965-27768-0027 BUT FINALLY WE CONSIDERED OURSELVES UNDER THE NECESSITY OF PROTESTING AGAINST SUCH AN UNJUST AND SERIOUS ACCUSATION BEFORE THE FACE OF THE WHOLE OF INTELLECTUAL SOCIETY
4965-27768-0028 THE SITUATION OF THIS ENEMY OF SOCIETY WHEN HE IS ACCUSED WHOLESALE OF AN OFFENCE WHICH HE NOT ONLY NEVER COMMITTED BUT WHICH HE IS READY TO RESIST WITH THE WHOLE STRENGTH OF HIS SOUL
4965-27768-0029 IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT HE WILL FEEL THE OUTRAGE OF SUCH AN INJUSTICE MORE KEENLY THAN A NORMAL AVERAGE FORTUNATE CITIZEN NOW WE DECLARE THAT THE ACCUSATION BROUGHT AGAINST US IS UTTERLY DEVOID OF ALL BASIS
