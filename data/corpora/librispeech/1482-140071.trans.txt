1482-140071-0000 THE ROMAN VILLAS HEARD HIM IN THE VALLEY OF THE THAMES COME OVER THE HILLS ROARING ABOVE THEIR ROOFS AND POURING ON SPIRE AND STAIR AND FLOORING BRIMSTONE AND PITCH AND FLAMES SHEER O'ER THE GREAT CHALK UPLANDS
1482-140071-0001 AND THE HILL OF THE HORSE WENT HE TILL HIGH ON HAMPSHIRE BEACONS HE SAW THE SOUTHERN SEA HIGH ON THE HEIGHTS OF WESSEX HE SAW THE SOUTHERN BRINE AND TURNED HIM TO A CONQUERED LAND
1482-140071-0002 AND WHERE THE NORTHERN THORNWOODS STAND AND THE ROAD PARTS ON EITHER HAND THERE CAME TO HIM A SIGN KING GUTHRUM WAS A WAR CHIEF A WISE MAN IN THE FIELD AND THOUGH HE PROSPERED WELL AND KNEW

1482-140071-0005 AND THOUGH STRANGE JOYS HAD GROWN IN THE NIGHT DESPAIR GREW WITH THE DAY AND WHEN WHITE DAWN CRAWLED THROUGH THE WOOD LIKE COLD FOAM OF A FLOOD THEN WEAKENED EVERY WARRIOR'S MOOD IN HOPE THOUGH NOT IN HARDIHOOD
1482-140071-0006 AND EACH MAN SORROWED AS HE STOOD IN THE FASHION OF HIS BLOOD FOR THE SAXON FRANKLIN SORROWED FOR THE THINGS THAT HAD BEEN FAIR FOR THE DEAR DEAD WOMAN CRIMSON CLAD AND THE GREAT FEASTS AND THE FRIENDS HE HAD
1482-140071-0007 I WRONGED A MAN TO HIS SLAYING AND A WOMAN TO HER SHAME AND ONCE I LOOKED ON A SWORN MAID THAT WAS WED TO THE HOLY NAME AND ONCE I TOOK MY NEIGHBOUR'S WIFE THAT WAS BOUND TO AN EASTLAND MAN IN THE STARKNESS OF MY EVIL YOUTH
1482-140071-0008 BEFORE MY GRIEFS BEGAN PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE ANY PRAYERS SAY PRAYERS FOR ME AND LAY ME UNDER A CHRISTIAN STONE IN THAT LOST LAND I THOUGHT MY OWN TO WAIT TILL THE HOLY HORN IS BLOWN
1482-140071-0009 NEXT NIGHT A KING MAY STARVE OR SLEEP BUT MEN AND BIRDS AND BEASTS SHALL WEEP AT THE BURIAL OF A FOOL O DRUNKARDS IN MY CELLAR BOYS IN MY APPLE TREE THE WORLD GROWS STERN AND STRANGE AND NEW

1482-140071-0011 HAVE NEVER WISHED ME HARM AND ALL WERE MOVED A LITTLE BUT COLAN STOOD APART HAVING FIRST PITY AND AFTER HEARING LIKE RAT IN RAFTER THAT LITTLE WORM OF LAUGHTER THAT EATS THE IRISH HEART
1482-140071-0012 AND HIS GREY GREEN EYES WERE CRUEL AND THE SMILE OF HIS MOUTH WAXED HARD AND HE SAID AND WHEN DID BRITAIN BECOME YOUR BURYING YARD BEFORE THE ROMANS LIT THE LAND WHEN SCHOOLS AND MONKS WERE NONE
1482-140071-0013 WE REARED SUCH STONES TO THE SUN GOD AS MIGHT PUT OUT THE SUN THE TALL TREES OF BRITAIN WE WORSHIPPED AND WERE WISE BUT YOU SHALL RAID THE WHOLE LAND THROUGH AND NEVER A TREE SHALL TALK TO YOU THOUGH EVERY LEAF IS A TONGUE TAUGHT TRUE
1482-140071-0014 AND THE FOREST IS FULL OF EYES ON ONE ROUND HILL TO THE SEAWARD THE TREES GROW TALL AND GREY AND THE TREES TALK TOGETHER WHEN ALL MEN ARE AWAY
1482-140071-0015 THE TREES GROW TALL IN RINGS AND THE TREES TALK TOGETHER OF MANY PAGAN THINGS YET I COULD LIE AND LISTEN WITH A CROSS UPON MY CLAY AND HEAR UNHURT FOR EVER WHAT THE TREES OF BRITAIN SAY A PROUD MAN WAS THE ROMAN
1482-140071-0016 HIS SPEECH A SINGLE ONE BUT HIS EYES WERE LIKE AN EAGLE'S EYES THAT IS STARING AT THE SUN DIG FOR ME WHERE I DIE HE SAID IF FIRST OR LAST I FALL DEAD ON THE FELL AT THE FIRST CHARGE OR DEAD BY WANTAGE WALL
1482-140071-0017 LIFT NOT MY HEAD FROM BLOODY GROUND BEAR NOT MY BODY HOME FOR ALL THE EARTH IS ROMAN EARTH AND I SHALL DIE IN ROME THEN ALFRED KING OF ENGLAND BADE BLOW THE HORNS OF WAR
1482-140071-0018 OUT FROM THE BLACK WOOD INTO THE BLAZE OF SUN AND STEEL AND SONG AND WHEN THEY CAME TO THE OPEN LAND THEY WHEELED DEPLOYED AND STOOD MIDMOST WERE MARCUS AND THE KING AND ELDRED ON THE RIGHT HAND WING
1482-140071-0019 FAR TO THE KING'S LEFT ELF THE BARD LED ON THE EASTERN WING WITH SONGS AND SPELLS THAT CHANGE THE BLOOD AND ON THE KING'S RIGHT HAROLD STOOD THE KINSMAN OF THE KING YOUNG HAROLD COARSE WITH COLOURS GAY
1482-140071-0020 SMOKING WITH OIL AND MUSK AND THE PLEASANT VIOLENCE OF THE YOUNG PUSHED THROUGH HIS PEOPLE GIVING TONGUE
1482-140071-0021 BUT AS HE CAME BEFORE HIS LINE A LITTLE SPACE ALONG HIS BEARDLESS FACE BROKE INTO MIRTH AND HE CRIED WHAT BROKEN BITS OF EARTH ARE HERE FOR WHAT THEIR CLOTHES ARE WORTH I WOULD SELL THEM FOR A SONG FOR COLAN WAS HUNG WITH RAIMENT
1482-140071-0022 TATTERED LIKE AUTUMN LEAVES AND HIS MEN WERE ALL AS THIN AS SAINTS AND ALL AS POOR AS THIEVES NO BOWS NOR SLINGS NOR BOLTS THEY BORE BUT BILLS AND PIKES ILL MADE AND NONE BUT COLAN BORE A SWORD
1482-140071-0023 AND RUSTY WAS ITS BLADE AND COLAN'S EYES WITH MYSTERY AND IRON LAUGHTER STIRRED AND HE SPOKE ALOUD BUT LIGHTLY NOT LABOURING TO BE HEARD OH TRULY WE BE BROKEN HEARTS FOR THAT CAUSE IT IS SAID
1482-140071-0024 WE LIGHT OUR CANDLES TO THAT LORD THAT BROKE HIMSELF FOR BREAD BUT THOUGH WE HOLD BUT BITTERLY WHAT LAND THE SAXON LEAVES THOUGH IRELAND BE BUT A LAND OF SAINTS AND WALES A LAND OF THIEVES
1482-140071-0025 THAT STRICKEN SPIRITS NEVER STRIKE NOR LEAN HANDS HOLD A SWORD AND IF EVER YE RIDE IN IRELAND THE JEST MAY YET BE SAID THERE IS THE LAND OF BROKEN HEARTS AND THE LAND OF BROKEN HEADS NOT LESS BARBARIAN LAUGHTER
1482-140071-0026 AND STOPPING IN HIS ONWARD STRIDES HE SNATCHED A BOW IN SCORN FROM SOME MEAN SLAVE AND BENT IT ON COLAN WHOSE DOOM GREW DARK AND SHONE
1482-140071-0027 FOR COLAN HAD NOT BOW NOR SLING ON A LONELY SWORD LEANED HE LIKE ARTHUR ON EXCALIBUR IN THE BATTLE BY THE SEA TO HIS GREAT GOLD EAR RING HAROLD TUGGED BACK THE FEATHERED TAIL AND SWIFT HAD SPRUNG THE ARROW
1482-140071-0028 BUT SWIFTER SPRANG THE GAEL WHIRLING THE ONE SWORD ROUND HIS HEAD A GREAT WHEEL IN THE SUN HE SENT IT SPLENDID THROUGH THE SKY FLYING BEFORE THE SHAFT COULD FLY IT SMOTE EARL HAROLD OVER THE EYE

1482-140071-0033 BUT ONE ARROW ALONE LOVE WITH THE SHIELD OF THE BROKEN HEART EVER HIS BOW DOTH BEND WITH A SINGLE SHAFT FOR A SINGLE PRIZE AND THE ULTIMATE BOLT THAT PARTS AND FLIES
1482-140071-0034 COMES WITH A THUNDER OF SPLIT SKIES AND A SOUND OF SOULS THAT REND SO SHALL YOU EARN A KING'S SWORD WHO CAST YOUR SWORD AWAY AND THE KING TOOK WITH A RANDOM EYE A RUDE AXE FROM A HIND HARD BY AND TURNED HIM TO THE FRAY
