7384-84010-0029 FRIEND OTTO IS A BRAVE YOUNG GALLANT ELSE HAD HE NEVER DARED RAISED SPEAR AND BANNER AS HE DID AGAINST HIS RIGHTFUL LIEGE BUT MY FATHER PERSISTED THE GENTLE HEARTED GIRL SPEAR AND BANNER ARE NOT LIONS JAWS AND SURELY YOU MAY NOT IN HONOR PERMIT THE WILFUL MURDER OF A HOSTAGE
7384-84010-0030 NAY MADAM HAVE NO FEAR THE LORD OF ARKELL SAID BENDING IN COURTEOUS RECOGNITION OF HER INTEREST THAT WHICH I DO OF MINE OWN FREE WILL IS NO MURDER EVEN SHOULD IT FAIL AND HE HASTENED FROM THE HALL
7384-84010-0031 A RAISED GALLERY LOOKED DOWN INTO THE SPACIOUS INCLOSURE IN WHICH COUNT WILLIAM KEPT THE LIVING SPECIMENS OF HIS OWN PRINCELY BADGE OF THE LION AND HERE THE COMPANY GATHERED TO SEE THE SPORT WITH THE GRAY GABARDINE DRAWN BUT LOOSELY OVER HIS SILKEN SUIT SO THAT HE MIGHT IF NEED BE
7384-84010-0032 EASILY SLIP FROM IT OTTO VON ARKELL BOLDLY ENTERED THE INCLOSURE SOHO JUNO UP HERCULES HOLLO UP AJAX CRIED COUNT WILLIAM FROM THE BALCONY HERE COMETH A RIGHT ROYAL PLAYFELLOW UP UP MY BEAUTIES AND THE GREAT BRUTES ROUSED BY THE VOICE OF THEIR MASTER
7384-84010-0033 PULLED THEMSELVES UP SHOOK THEMSELVES AWAKE AND STARED AT THE INTRUDER BOLDLY AND WITHOUT HESITATION WHILE ALL THE WATCHERS HAD EYES BUT FOR HIM ALONE THE YOUNG LORD OF ARKELL WALKED STRAIGHT UP TO HERCULES THE LARGEST OF THE THREE
7384-84010-0034 AND LAID HIS HAND CARESSINGLY UPON THE SHAGGY MANE CLOSE TO HIS SIDE PRESSED JUNO THE LIONESS AND SO SAYS THE RECORD OF THE OLD DUTCH CHRONICLER VON HILDEGAERSBERCH THE LIONS DID HIM NO HARM
7384-84010-0035 BUT AJAX FIERCEST OF THE THREE TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE LAD STRAIGHT ACROSS HIS COMRADES HE LOOKED TO WHERE SCARCE A ROD BEHIND THE DARING LAD CAME ANOTHER FIGURE A LIGHT AND GRACEFUL FORM
7384-84010-0036 IN CLINGING ROBES OF BLUE AND UNDERGOWN OF CLOTH OF GOLD THE PRINCESS JACQUELINE HERSELF THE WATCHERS IN THE GALLERY FOLLOWED THE LION'S STARE AND SAW WITH HORROR THE ADVANCING FIGURE OF THIS FAIR YOUNG GIRL
7384-84010-0037 A CRY OF TERROR BROKE FROM EVERY LIP THE DAUPHIN JOHN TURNED PALE WITH FRIGHT AND COUNT WILLIAM OF HOLLAND CALLING OUT DOWN AJAX BACK GIRL BACK
7384-84010-0038 BUT BEFORE HE COULD ACT
7384-84010-0039 WITH A BOUND HE CLEARED THE INTERVENING SPACE AND CROUCHED AT THE FEET OF THE FAIR YOUNG PRINCESS JACQUELINE
7384-84010-0040 FOR AS THE RECORDS TELL US THEY DID NO HARM TO THEIR VISITORS AJAX SLOWLY ROSE AND LOOKED UP INTO THE GIRL'S CALM FACE THEN THE VOICE OF JACQUELINE RANG OUT FRESH AND CLEAR AS STANDING WITH HER HAND BURIED IN THE LION'S TAWNY MANE
7384-84010-0041 SHE RAISED HER FACE TO THE STARTLED GALLERIES YOU WHO COULD DARE AND YET DARED NOT TO DO SHE CRIED IT SHALL NOT BE SAID THAT IN ALL COUNT WILLIAM'S COURT NONE SAVE THE REBEL LORD OF ARKELL DARED TO FACE COUNT WILLIAM'S LIONS
7384-84010-0042 THE LORD OF ARKELL SPRANG TO HIS COMRADE'S SIDE WITH A HURRIED WORD OF PRAISE HE FLUNG THE GABARDINE ABOUT HER GRASPED HER ARM AND BADE HER KEEP HER EYES FIRMLY FIXED UPON THE LIONS THEN STEP BY STEP THOSE TWO FOOLHARDY YOUNG PERSONS BACKED SLOWLY OUT OF THE DANGER
7384-84010-0043 INTO WHICH THEY HAD SO THOUGHTLESSLY AND UNNECESSARILY FORCED THEMSELVES THE LIONS GATE CLOSED BEHIND THEM WITH A CLANG
7384-84010-0044 AND OVER ALL THEY HEARD THE VOICE OF THE LORD OF HOLLAND MINGLING COMMENDATION AND PRAISE WITH CENSURE FOR THE RASHNESS OF THEIR ACTION AND IT WAS A RASH AND FOOLISH ACT BUT WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THOSE WERE DAYS WHEN SUCH FEATS WERE ESTEEMED AS BRAVE AND VALOROUS
7384-84010-0045 WAS REARED IN THE SCHOOL OF SO CALLED CHIVALRY AND ROMANCE WHICH IN HER TIME WAS FAST APPROACHING ITS END SHE WAS INDEED AS ONE HISTORIAN DECLARES THE LAST HEROINE OF KNIGHTHOOD
7384-84010-0046 SHE WAS DAUGHTER OF HOLLAND COUNTESS OF PONTHIEU DUCHESS OF BERRY LADY OF CREVECOEUR OF MONTAGUE AND ARLOEUX BROUGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF TILTS AND TOURNAMENTS OF BANQUETS AND FEASTING AND ALL THE LAVISH DISPLAY OF THE RICH BAVARIAN COURT
7384-84010-0047 SHE WAS AS WE LEARN FROM HER CHRONICLERS THE LEADER OF ADORING KNIGHTS AND VASSALS THE IDOL OF HER PARENTS THE RULER OF HER SOFT HEARTED BOY HUSBAND AN EXPERT FALCONER A DARING HORSEWOMAN AND A FEARLESS DESCENDANT OF THOSE WOMAN WARRIORS OF HER RACE
7384-84010-0048 MARGARET THE EMPRESS AND PHILIPPA THE QUEEN AND OF A HOUSE THAT TRACED ITS DESCENT THROUGH THE WARLIKE HOHENSTAUFENS BACK TO CHARLEMAGNE HIMSELF ALL GIRLS ADMIRE BRAVERY EVEN THOUGH NOT THEMSELVES PERSONALLY COURAGEOUS
7384-84010-0049 IT IS NOT THEREFORE SURPRISING THAT THIS INTREPID AND ROMANCE REARED YOUNG PRINCESS THE WIFE OF A LAD FOR WHOM SHE NEVER ESPECIALLY CARED AND WHOSE SOCIETY HAD FOR POLITICAL REASONS BEEN FORCED UPON HER SHOULD HAVE PLACED AS THE HERO OF HER ADMIRATION
7384-84010-0050 NEXT TO HER OWN FEARLESS FATHER NOT THE DAUPHIN JOHN OF FRANCE BUT THIS BRAVE YOUNG REBEL LAD OTTO THE LORD OF ARKELL
7384-84010-0051 AND THE HAGUE WERE FAST DRAWING TO A CLOSE ON THE FOURTH OF APRIL FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN THE DAUPHIN JOHN DIED BY POISONING IN HIS FATHER'S CASTLE AT COMPIEGNE
7384-84010-0052 THAT WERE THEN DISGRACING AND ENDANGERING THE FEEBLE THRONE OF FRANCE THE DREAM OF FUTURE POWER AND GREATNESS AS QUEEN OF FRANCE IN WHICH THE GIRL WIFE OF THE DAUPHIN HAD OFTEN INDULGED WAS THUS RUDELY DISPELLED AND JACQUELINE RETURNED TO HER FATHER'S COURT IN HOLLAND
7384-84010-0053 NO LONGER CROWN PRINCESS AND HEIRESS TO A THRONE BUT SIMPLY LADY OF HOLLAND BUT IN HOLLAND TOO SORROW WAS IN STORE FOR HER SWIFTLY FOLLOWING THE LOSS OF HER HUSBAND THE DAUPHIN
7384-84010-0054 CAME THE STILL HEAVIER BLOW OF HER FATHER'S DEATH ON THE THIRTIETH OF MAY FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN COUNT WILLIAM DIED IN HIS CASTLE OF BOUCHAIN IN HAINAULT AND HIS SORROWING DAUGHTER JACQUELINE NOW A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF SIXTEEN
7384-84010-0055 SUCCEEDED TO HIS TITLES AND LORDSHIP AS COUNTESS AND LADY SUPREME OF HAINAULT OF HOLLAND AND OF ZEALAND FOR YEARS HOWEVER THERE HAD BEEN THROUGHOUT THE LOW COUNTRIES A STRONG OBJECTION TO THE RULE OF A WOMAN
7384-84010-0056 THE DEATH OF COUNT WILLIAM SHOWED THE CODS A WAY TOWARD GREATER LIBERTY REBELLION FOLLOWED REBELLION AND THE RULE OF THE COUNTESS JACQUELINE WAS BY NO MEANS A RESTFUL ONE AND CHIEF AMONG THE REBELLIOUS SPIRITS AS LEADER AND COUNSELLOR AMONG THE CODS
7384-84010-0057 APPEARED THE BRAVE LAD WHO HAD ONCE BEEN THE COMPANION OF THE PRINCESS IN DANGER THE YOUNG LORD OF ARKELL IT WAS HE WHO LIFTED THE STANDARD OF REVOLT AGAINST HER REGENCY PLACING THE WELFARE OF HOLLAND ABOVE PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP AND SINKING IN HIS DESIRE FOR GLORY
7384-84010-0058 EVEN THE CHIVALRY OF THAT DAY WHICH SHOULD HAVE PROMPTED HIM TO AID RATHER THAN ANNOY THIS BEAUTIFUL GIRL HE RAISED A CONSIDERABLE ARMY AMONG THE KNIGHTS OF THE CODS OR LIBERAL PARTY AND THE WARLIKE MERCHANTS OF THE CITIES TOOK POSSESSION OF MANY STRONG POSITIONS IN HOLLAND
7384-84010-0059 AND OCCUPIED AMONG OTHER PLACES THE IMPORTANT TOWN OF GORKUM ON THE MAAS THE STOUT CITADEL OF THE TOWN WAS HOWEVER GARRISONED WITH LOYAL TROOPS THIS THE LORD OF ARKELL BESEIGED AND DEMANDING ITS SURRENDER
7384-84010-0060 SENT ALSO A HAUGHTY CHALLENGE TO THE YOUNG COUNTESS WHO WAS HASTENING TO THE RELIEF OF HER BELEAGUERED TOWN JACQUELINE'S ANSWER WAS SWIFT AND UNMISTAKABLE WITH THREE HUNDRED SHIPS AND SIX THOUSAND KNIGHTS AND MEN AT ARMS
7384-84010-0061 SHE SAILED FROM THE OLD HARBOR OF ROTTERDAM AND THE LION FLAG OF HER HOUSE SOON FLOATED ABOVE THE LOYAL CITADEL OF GORKUM HER DOUGHTY DUTCH GENERAL VON BREDERODE COUNSELLED IMMEDIATE ATTACK BUT THE GIRL COUNTESS THOUGH FULL OF ENTHUSIASM AND DETERMINATION HESITATED
7384-84010-0062 FROM HER STATION IN THE CITADEL SHE LOOKED OVER THE SCENE BEFORE HER HERE ALONG THE LOW BANK OF THE RIVER MAAS STRETCHED THE CAMP OF HER OWN FOLLOWERS AND THE LITTLE GAYLY COLORED BOATS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER ARMY UP THE RIVER FROM THE RED ROOFS OF ROTTERDAM
7384-84010-0063 THERE STRETCHING OUT INTO THE FLAT COUNTRY BEYOND THE STRAGGLING STREETS OF GORKUM LAY THE TENTS OF THE REBELS AND YET THEY WERE ALL HER COUNTRYMEN REBELS AND RETAINERS ALIKE HOLLANDERS ALL THEY WERE EVER READY TO COMBINE FOR THE DEFENCE OF THEIR HOMELAND
7384-84010-0064 WHEN THREATENED BY FOREIGN FOES OR BY THE DESTROYING OCEAN FLOODS JACQUELINE'S EYE CAUGHT THE FLUTTER OF THE BROAD BANNER OF THE HOUSE OF ARKELL THAT WAVED OVER THE REBEL CAMP AGAIN SHE SAW THE BRAVE LAD WHO ALONE OF ALL HER FATHER'S COURT SAVE SHE
7384-84010-0065 HAD DARED TO FACE COUNT WILLIAM'S LIONS AGAIN THE REMEMBRANCE OF HOW HIS DARING HAD MADE HIM ONE OF HER HEROES FILLED HER HEART AND A DREAM OF WHAT MIGHT BE POSSESSED HER HER BOY HUSBAND THE FRENCH DAUPHIN WAS DEAD
7384-84010-0066 AND SHE WAS PLEDGED BY HER DYING FATHER'S COMMAND TO MARRY HER COUSIN WHOM SHE DETESTED DUKE JOHN OF BRABANT BUT HOW MUCH BETTER SO SHE REASONED THAT THE NAME AND MIGHT OF HER HOUSE AS RULERS OF HOLLAND SHOULD BE UPHELD BY A BRAVE AND FEARLESS KNIGHT
7384-84010-0067 ON THE IMPULSE OF THIS THOUGHT SHE SUMMONED A LOYAL AND TRUSTED VASSAL TO HER AID VON LEYENBURG SHE SAID GO YOU IN HASTE AND IN SECRET TO THE LORD OF ARKELL AND BEAR FROM ME THIS MESSAGE FOR HIS EAR ALONE THUS SAYS THE LADY OF HOLLAND
7384-84010-0068 WERE IT NOT BETTER OTTO OF ARKELL THAT WE JOIN HANDS IN MARRIAGE BEFORE THE ALTAR THAN THAT WE SPILL THE BLOOD OF FAITHFUL FOLLOWERS AND VASSALS IN A CRUEL FIGHT IT WAS A SINGULAR AND PERHAPS TO OUR MODERN EARS A MOST UNLADYLIKE PROPOSAL
7384-84010-0069 BUT IT SHOWS HOW EVEN IN THE HEART OF A SOVEREIGN COUNTESS AND A GIRL GENERAL WARLIKE DESIRES MAY GIVE PLACE TO GENTLER THOUGHTS TO THE LORD ARKELL HOWEVER THIS UNEXPECTED PROPOSITION CAME AS AN INDICATION OF WEAKNESS
7384-84010-0070 MY LADY COUNTESS FEARS TO FACE MY DETERMINED FOLLOWERS HE THOUGHT LET ME BUT FORCE THIS FIGHT AND THE VICTORY IS MINE IN THAT IS GREATER GLORY AND MORE OF POWER THAN BEING HUSBAND TO THE LADY OF HOLLAND AND SO HE RETURNED A MOST UNGRACIOUS ANSWER
7384-84010-0071 TELL THE COUNTESS JACQUELINE HE SAID TO THE KNIGHT OF LEYENBURG THAT THE HONOR OF HER HAND I CANNOT ACCEPT I AM HER FOE AND WOULD RATHER DIE THAN MARRY HER ALL THE HOT BLOOD OF HER ANCESTORS FLAMED IN WRATH AS YOUNG JACQUELINE HEARD THIS REPLY OF THE REBEL LORD
7384-84010-0072 CRUSH WE THESE REBEL CURS VON BREDERODE SHE CRIED POINTING TO THE BANNER OF ARKELL FOR BY MY FATHER'S MEMORY THEY SHALL HAVE NEITHER MERCY NOR LIFE FROM ME FAST UPON THE CURT REFUSAL OF THE LORD OF ARKELL CAME HIS MESSAGE OF DEFIANCE HEAR YE COUNTESS OF HOLLAND RANG OUT THE CHALLENGE OF THE
7384-84010-0073 HERALD OF ARKELL AS HIS TRUMPET BLAST SOUNDED BEFORE THE GATE OF THE CITADEL THE FREE LORD OF ARKELL HERE GIVETH YOU WORD AND WARNING THAT HE WILL FIGHT AGAINST YOU ON THE MORROW AND FROM THE CITADEL CAME BACK THIS RINGING REPLY AS THE KNIGHT OF LEYENBURG MADE ANSWER FOR HIS SOVEREIGN LADY
7384-84010-0074 HEAR YE SIR HERALD AND ANSWER THUS TO THE REBEL LORD OF ARKELL FOR THE PURPOSE OF FIGHTING HIM CAME WE HERE AND FIGHT HIM WE WILL UNTIL HE AND HIS REBELS ARE BEATEN AND DEAD LONG LIVE OUR SOVEREIGN LADY OF HOLLAND ON THE MORROW
7384-84010-0075 A MURKY DECEMBER DAY IN THE YEAR FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN THE BATTLE WAS JOINED AS ANNOUNCED ON THE LOW PLAIN BEYOND THE CITY KNIGHTS AND MEN AT ARMS ARCHERS AND SPEARMEN CLOSED IN THE SHOCK OF BATTLE AND A STUBBORN AND BLOODY FIGHT IT WAS
7384-84010-0076 SEVEN TIMES DID THE KNIGHTS OF JACQUELINE GLITTERING IN THEIR STEEL ARMOR CLASH INTO THE REBEL RANKS SEVEN TIMES WERE THEY DRIVEN BACK UNTIL AT LAST THE LORD OF ARKELL WITH A FIERY CHARGE FORCED THEM AGAINST THE VERY GATES OF THE CITADEL
7384-84010-0077 THE BRAVE VON BREDERODE FELL PIERCED WITH WOUNDS AND THE DAY SEEMED LOST INDEED TO THE LADY OF HOLLAND THEN JACQUELINE THE COUNTESS SEEING HER CAUSE IN DANGER LIKE ANOTHER JOAN OF ARC THOUGH SHE WAS INDEED A YOUNGER AND MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL GIRL GENERAL
7384-84010-0078 SEIZED THE LION BANNER OF HER HOUSE AND AT THE HEAD OF HER RESERVE TROOPS CHARGED THROUGH THE OPEN GATE STRAIGHT INTO THE RANKS OF HER VICTORIOUS FOES THERE WAS NEITHER MERCY NOR GENTLENESS IN HER HEART THEN AS WHEN SHE HAD COWED WITH A LOOK AJAX THE LION
7384-84010-0079 SO NOW WITH DEFIANCE AND WRATH IN HER FACE SHE DASHED STRAIGHT AT THE FOE HER DISHEARTENED KNIGHTS RALLIED AROUND HER AND FOLLOWING THE IMPETUOUS GIRL THEY WIELDED AXE AND LANCE FOR THE FINAL STRUGGLE THE RESULT CAME QUICKLY
7384-84010-0080 THE PONDEROUS BATTLE AXE OF THE KNIGHT OF LEYENBURG CRASHED THROUGH THE HELMET OF THE LORD OF ARKELL AND AS THE BRAVE YOUNG LEADER FELL TO THE GROUND HIS PANIC STRICKEN FOLLOWERS TURNED AND FLED THE TROOPS OF JACQUELINE PURSUED THEM THROUGH THE STREETS OF GORKUM AND OUT INTO THE OPEN COUNTRY
7384-84010-0081 AND THE VENGEANCE OF THE COUNTESS WAS SHARP AND MERCILESS BUT IN THE FLUSH OF VICTORY WRATH GAVE WAY TO PITY AGAIN AND THE YOUNG CONQUEROR IS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID SADLY AND IN TEARS AH I HAVE WON AND YET HOW HAVE I LOST
7384-84010-0082 BUT THE KNIGHTS AND NOBLES WHO FOLLOWED HER BANNER LOUDLY PRAISED HER VALOR AND HER FEARLESSNESS AND THEIR HIGHEST AND MOST KNIGHTLY VOW THEREAFTER WAS TO SWEAR BY THE COURAGE OF OUR PRINCESS THE BRILLIANT VICTORY OF THIS GIRL OF SIXTEEN WAS NOT HOWEVER
7384-84010-0083 TO ACCOMPLISH HER DESIRES PEACE NEVER CAME TO HER HARASSED BY REBELLION AT HOME AND PERSECUTED BY HER RELENTLESS AND PERFIDIOUS UNCLES COUNT JOHN OF BAVARIA RIGHTLY CALLED THE PITILESS AND DUKE PHILIP OF BURGUNDY FALSELY CALLED THE GOOD
7384-84010-0084 SHE WHO HAD ONCE BEEN CROWN PRINCESS OF FRANCE AND LADY OF HOLLAND DIED AT THE EARLY AGE OF THIRTY SIX STRIPPED OF ALL HER TITLES AND ESTATES IT IS HOWEVER PLEASANT TO THINK THAT SHE WAS HAPPY IN THE LOVE OF HER HUSBAND
7384-84010-0085 THE BARON OF THE FORESTS OF THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY A PLAIN DUTCH GENTLEMAN FRANCIS VON BORSELEN THE LAD WHO YEARS BEFORE HAD FURNISHED THE GRAY GABARDINE THAT HAD SHIELDED COUNT WILLIAM'S DAUGHTER FROM HER FATHER'S LIONS
7384-84010-0086 THE STORY OF JACQUELINE OF HOLLAND IS ONE OF THE MOST ROMANTIC THAT HAS COME DOWN TO US FROM THOSE ROMANTIC DAYS OF THE KNIGHTS HAPPY ONLY IN HER EARLIEST AND LATEST YEARS SHE IS NEVERTHELESS A BRIGHT AND ATTRACTIVE FIGURE AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF FEUDAL TYRANNY AND CRIME
7384-84010-0087 THE STORY OF HER WOMANHOOD SHOULD INDEED BE TOLD IF WE WOULD STUDY HER LIFE AS A WHOLE BUT FOR US WHO CAN IN THIS PAPER DEAL ONLY WITH HER ROMANTIC GIRLHOOD HER YOUNG LIFE IS TO BE TAKEN AS A TYPE OF THE STIRRING AND EXTRAVAGANT DAYS OF CHIVALRY
7384-84010-0088 AND WE CANNOT BUT THINK WITH SADNESS UPON THE POWER FOR GOOD THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN HER LAND OF FOGS AND FLOODS IF INSTEAD OF BEING MADE THE TOOL OF PARTY HATE AND THE AMBITIONS OF MEN HER FRANK AND FEARLESS GIRL NATURE
7384-84010-0089 TO BE THE MOST PICTURESQUE FIGURE IN THE HISTORY OF HOLLAND AS SHE HAS BEEN CALLED IS DISTINCTION INDEED BUT HIGHER STILL MUST SURELY BE THAT GENTLENESS OF CHARACTER AND NOBILITY OF SOUL THAT IN THESE DAYS OF OURS
7384-84010-0090 MAY BE ACQUIRED BY EVERY GIRL AND BOY WHO READS THIS ROMANTIC STORY OF THE COUNTESS JACQUELINE
