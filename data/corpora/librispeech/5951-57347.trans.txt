5951-57347-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN GRIFFIN LEEDS AT A DISCOUNT
5951-57347-0001 I DID NOT EXPECT THAT MISTER CORNWOOD WOULD COME ON SHORE AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND ME AND I DID NOT HURRY ON BOARD WHEN I LEFT THE HOUSE OF COLONEL SHEPARD
5951-57347-0002 I PASSED FROM SAINT JAMES SQUARE DOWN LAURA STREET INTO FORSYTH ON WHICH THE SAINT JOHNS HOUSE WAS SITUATED I PASSED THE HOUSE SEVERAL TIMES LOOKING FOR WASHBURN
5951-57347-0003 I SAW NOTHING OF THE MATE AND I WENT INTO BAY STREET ONLY A SQUARE FROM FORSYTH I LOOKED IN EVERY DIRECTION FOR WASHBURN BUT I COULD NOT FIND HIM AND I WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE UP THE SEARCH I FOUND MY BOAT'S CREW ON THE WHARF
5951-57347-0004 WATCHING SOME NEGROES OPENING OYSTERS IT WAS DONE IN A VERY CLUMSY MANNER COMPARED WITH THE WORK OF A PROVIDENCE OPENER I HAD SEEN IN NEW YORK AND MY MEN WERE NOT AT ALL SATISFIED WITH THE MANNER IT WAS DONE
5951-57347-0005 THOUGH THEY HAD NO INTEREST IN THE JOB HAVE YOU SEEN MISTER WASHBURN BEN I ASKED AS WE WALKED DOWN THE WHARF YES SIR WE PUT HIM ON BOARD HALF AN HOUR AGO REPLIED THE ASSISTANT ENGINEER WHO PREFERRED TO PULL A BOAT RATHER THAN BE IDLE
5951-57347-0006 THAT WAS WHY I COULD NOT FIND HIM IN THE STREETS OF JACKSONVILLE I ADDED HAS ANY ONE COME OFF FROM THE STEAMER SINCE I CAME ASHORE NO SIR NOT A SOUL ANSWERED BEN DECIDEDLY
5951-57347-0007 I WAS GLAD TO HEAR THIS FOR IT ASSURED ME THAT CORNWOOD HAD NOT LEFT THE STEAMER THE SYLVANIA WAS ANCHORED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAIN CHANNEL WHICH WAS NEAR THE LINE OF WHARVES
5951-57347-0008 IN A FEW MINUTES I WAS ON BOARD THE MATE WAS AT SUPPER AND AS I HAD DINED WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS I DID NOT DISTURB HIM I WENT TO THE STEWARD AND GAVE HIM DIRECTIONS IN REGARD TO THE LUNCH AND DINNER FOR THE NEXT DAY
5951-57347-0009 CORNWOOD WAS SMOKING HIS CIGAR ON THE FORECASTLE I TOOK THE PRECAUTION TO TELL HIM THAT I WANTED TO SEE HIM IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR OR LESS THAT HE MIGHT NOT COME INTO MY ROOM WHILE I WAS ENGAGED WITH WASHBURN
5951-57347-0010 I HAD DONE SOME THINKING OVER THE MATTER OF EAVESDROPPERS ON BOARD I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT I WOULD HAVE NOTHING OF THE KIND ON BOARD I HAD ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN THE TWO ENGINEERS ONE OF WHOM WAS THE SON OF MY GUARDIAN IN MONTOMERCY
5951-57347-0011 AND THE OTHER HAD SAILED WITH ME SINCE THE SYLVANIA HAD COME INTO MY POSSESSION MOSES BRICKLAND THE CHIEF WAS LYING ON A SOFA IN THE ENGINE ROOM I CALLED BEN AND TOLD THEM BOTH ENOUGH TO ENABLE THEM TO UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION
5951-57347-0012 AND THAT SOME OF THE LATER ADDITIONS TO OUR SHIP'S COMPANY MIGHT BE EAVESDROPPERS
5951-57347-0013 AND LET ME KNOW IF THERE WERE ANY SKULKING OR LOITERING NEAR THEM MOSES SEATED HIMSELF AT ONE DOOR OF THE ENGINE ROOM AND BEN AT THE OTHER THEY WERE ON DECK NEXT TO THE RAIL WHERE THEY COULD SEE THE WINDOWS OF MY ROOM
5951-57347-0014 THERE WAS A SKYLIGHT IN THE HURRICANE DECK OVERHEAD WHICH WAS ALWAYS OPEN IN THIS CLIMATE WHEN IT DID NOT RAIN I SAID NOTHING ABOUT THIS OPENING BECAUSE I COULD HEAR ANY PERSON'S FOOTSTEPS ON THE DECK OVER ME
5951-57347-0015 FOR ONE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY AND THE OTHER WANTED TO HEAR IT
5951-57347-0016 HE REPLIED THAT HE HAD THOUGHT OF DOING SOMETHING OF THE KIND HIMSELF BUT HE DID NOT CARE TO THROW SUSPICION EVEN UPON GRIFFIN LEEDS BY TELLING OTHERS THE TRUE STORY WELL WASHBURN DID YOU FIND YOUR MAN I ASKED
5951-57347-0017 I AM SORRY TO SAY I DID NOT HE REPLIED BUT I FOUND WHERE HE BOARDED AND WAS TOLD HE WAS OUT AND WOULD NOT RETURN BEFORE NINE OR TEN IN THE EVENING I SHALL TRY AGAIN EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE HE GOES OUT FOR THE DAY
5951-57347-0018 FOR HE TAKES ONLY HIS BREAKFAST AT THE HOUSE WHERE HE LODGES WHERE DOES HE LODGE I INQUIRED WASHBURN GAVE ME THE STREET AND NUMBER
5951-57347-0019 IT WAS NOT IN THE BEST PART OF THE CITY BY ANY MEANS AND THE MATE INFERRED THAT HE WAS NOT CONNECTED WITH THE FIRST FAMILIES BUT HE WAS NONE THE WORSE FOR THIS HIS LANDLORD KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HIM
5951-57347-0020 AND HAD MADE HIM PAY A WEEK'S BOARD IN ADVANCE WE CONTINUED TO TALK ABOUT COBBINGTON FOR SOME TIME BUT WE WERE NONE THE WISER WHEN WE GOT THROUGH THAN WHEN WE BEGAN SUDDENLY WE HEARD A TREMENDOUS SCUFFLING OVERHEAD
5951-57347-0021 IT SOUNDED AS THOUGH TWO MEN OR MORE WERE ENGAGED IN A SEVERE CONFLICT AFTER THE FIRST ONSLAUGHT WAS OVER THE VOICES OF TWO ANGRY MEN WERE HEARD AND ONE OF THEM WAS THAT OF BEN BOWMAN BOTH WASHBURN AND I RUSHED OUT OF THE STATE ROOM HE AT ONE DOOR AND I AT THE OTHER
5951-57347-0022 WHICH I HAD FORBIDDEN ANY ONE ON BOARD TO DO AT THE BEGINNING OF THE VOYAGE TO PREVENT INJURY TO THE PAINT I CONCLUDED THAT GRIFFIN HAD COME UP IN THE SAME WAY
5951-57347-0023 THE OCCASION OF THE STRIFE WAS PLAIN ENOUGH TO ME AS SOON AS I DISCOVERED WHO WERE ENGAGED IN IT I FELT A LITTLE CHEAP AFTER ALL THE PRECAUTIONS I HAD TAKEN TO PREVENT BEING OVERHEARD LET HIM UP BEN I SAID WHEN I THOUGHT HE HAD DONE ENOUGH
5951-57347-0024 THE ENGINEER AT ONCE RELINQUISHED HIS HOLD ON THE OCTOROON AND STOOD UP BUT GRIFFIN DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ABLE TO GET UP YET
5951-57347-0025 AND NEITHER OF THEM WAS ABLE TO SPEAK FOR SOME MINUTES AS THE WAITER LAY ON THE DECK I NOTICED THAT HE WORE NO SHOES
5951-57347-0026 IT IS PLAIN ENOUGH WHAT THIS AFFAIR MEANS I SAID TO THE MATE WHILE WE WERE WAITING FOR BEN TO GET HIS BREATH AND TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE OCCASION OF THE CONFLICT WAS IT DON'T NEED A VERY LONG HEADED MAN TO EXPLAIN IT REPLIED THE MATE
5951-57347-0027 GRIFFIN HAS BEEN AT THE OLD TRICK AGAIN WHAT IS THE OLD TRICK MISTER MATE DEMANDED CORNWOOD RATHER OFFENSIVELY IF YOU ARE A SAILOR YOU WILL CALL ME BY MY NAME REPLIED WASHBURN WITH DIGNITY
5951-57347-0028 EXCUSE ME MISTER WASHBURN BUT I AM SOMEWHAT INTERESTED IN ONE OF THE PARTIES TO THIS ROW ADDED CORNWOOD AS HE GLANCED AT ME I MEANT NO OFFENCE BUT I WAS A LITTLE EXCITED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES
5951-57347-0029 AND HE WAS EVIDENTLY STRUGGLING TO BE CALM WILL YOU BE KIND ENOUGH TO TELL ME MISTER WASHBURN WHAT THE OLD TRICK WAS EAVESDROPPING LISTENING TO CONVERSATION NOT INTENDED FOR HIM
5951-57347-0030 WHICH WAS GOING ON IN THE CAPTAIN'S ROOM REPLIED THE MATE RATHER WARMLY IT IS VERY STRANGE TO ME FOR I HAVE KNOWN THE BOY FOR YEARS
5951-57347-0031 ADDED CORNWOOD I DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS A BETTER BEHAVED BOY IN THE STATE THAN GRIFFIN LEEDS EXCUSE ME FOR SAYING SO MUCH WHICH I SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID IF I HAD NOT BROUGHT THE BOY ON BOARD AND RECOMMENDED HIM TO YOU
5951-57347-0032 I HAD NO FAULT TO FIND WITH HIS STATEMENT AS LONG AS IT WAS RESPECTFUL BY THIS TIME BEN HAD GOT HIS WIND AGAIN AND APPEARED TO BE READY TO EXPLAIN THE REASON FOR THE CONFLICT WHICH HAD CREATED SUCH A SENSATION ON BOARD
5951-57347-0033 ALL HANDS WERE ON DECK GATHERED AROUND THE COMBATANTS I WAS SATISFIED FROM THE BEGINNING THAT BEN HAD NOT BEGUN THE FIGHT
5951-57347-0034 EXCEPT WHEN HE HAD BEEN ORDERED TO DO SO BY THE MATE IN TWO INSTANCES BOTH OF THEM BEING THE EXPULSION FROM THE VESSEL OF CAPTAIN BOOMSBY WELL HOW WAS IT MISTER BOWMAN I ASKED CALLING HIM BY HIS LAST NAME WITH A HANDLE TO IT
5951-57347-0035 A FEW MINUTES BEFORE I CAME UPON THE HURRICANE DECK SIR I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE MOTION FORWARD OF THE FOREMAST I STOOD UP BUT I COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING OR ANYBODY BUT I COULD NOT GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON THERE
5951-57347-0036 I SPOKE TO MISTER BRICKLAND ABOUT IT AND HE TOLD ME TO GO UP AND SEE WHAT IT WAS
5951-57347-0037 MISTER BOWMAN IS ANSWERING MY QUESTION MISTER CORNWOOD AND YOU WILL NOT INTERFERE I INTERPOSED FOR THE FLORIDIAN APPEARED TO HAVE TAKEN UPON HIMSELF THE DUTY OF COUNSEL FOR THE OCTOROON I BEG YOUR PARDON CAPTAIN REPLIED CORNWOOD WITH A DEFERENTIAL BOW
5951-57347-0038 AS SOON AS I WAS SATISFIED THAT HE WAS LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN YOU AND MISTER WASHBURN WHICH I COULD HEAR THOUGH I COULD NOT TELL WHAT YOU SAID I JUST TOUCHED HIM ON THE SHOULDER I MEANT TO BECKON HIM TO COME AWAY FROM THE SKYLIGHT
5951-57347-0039 BUT HE DID NOT GIVE ME TIME TO DO THAT HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND
5951-57347-0040 YOU LIE YELLED THE OCTOROON WITH A SAVAGE OATH YOU DID TRY TO MURDER ME GRIFFIN LEAPED FROM HIS RECUMBENT POSITION AND
5951-57347-0041 FOAMING WITH RAGE DREW A BOWIE KNIFE FROM HIS POCKET THE LONG BLADE OF WHICH HE THREW OPEN WITH A JERK OF HIS HAND WITH THE KNIFE GLEAMING IN THE AIR HE RUSHED UPON BEN BOWMAN
5951-57347-0042 THE DECKHAND WAS THE STOUTEST PERSON ON BOARD AND HE BORE THE OCTOROON TO THE DECK IN AN INSTANT AND WRENCHED THE KNIFE FROM HIS GRASP HOLD ON TO HIM A MOMENT BUCK
5951-57347-0043 GET SOME LINE AND TIE HIM HAND AND FOOT
5951-57347-0044 ARMS OF THE WAITER BEHIND HIM HE SECURED THEM IN THIS POSITION WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE MATE
5951-57347-0045 AND THE PRISONER WAS CAREFULLY SECURED
