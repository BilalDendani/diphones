107-22887-0029 I REACHED AND GOT THE PAPER AND THEN WE STOOD UP AND WAITED PERFECTLY STILL BUD NEVER STIRRED I TURNED THE KEY OF THE OUTSIDE DOOR VERY SOFT AND SLOW THEN TURNED THE KNOB THE SAME WAY AND WE WENT TIPTOEING OUT ONTO THE GUARD
107-22887-0030 AND SHUT THE DOOR VERY SOFT AND GENTLE THERE WARN'T NOBODY STIRRING ANYWHERE AND THE BOAT WAS SLIPPING ALONG SWIFT AND STEADY THROUGH THE BIG WATER IN THE SMOKY MOONLIGHT WE NEVER SAID A WORD BUT WENT STRAIGHT UP ONTO THE HURRICANE DECK AND PLUMB BACK AFT
107-22887-0031 AND SET DOWN ON THE END OF THE SKY LIGHT BOTH OF US KNOWED WHAT THAT MEANT WITHOUT HAVING TO EXPLAIN TO ONE ANOTHER BUD DIXON WOULD WAKE UP AND MISS THE SWAG AND WOULD COME STRAIGHT FOR US FOR HE AIN'T AFEARD OF ANYTHING OR ANYBODY THAT MAN AIN'T HE WOULD COME AND WE WOULD HEAVE HIM OVERBOARD
107-22887-0032 OR GET KILLED TRYING IT MADE ME SHIVER BECAUSE I AIN'T AS BRAVE AS SOME PEOPLE BUT IF I SHOWED THE WHITE FEATHER WELL I KNOWED BETTER THAN DO THAT I KIND OF HOPED THE BOAT WOULD LAND SOMERS AND WE COULD SKIP ASHORE AND NOT HAVE TO RUN THE RISK OF THIS ROW
107-22887-0033 I WAS SO SCARED OF BUD DIXON BUT SHE WAS AN UPPER RIVER TUB AND THERE WARN'T NO REAL CHANCE OF THAT WELL THE TIME STRUNG ALONG AND ALONG AND THAT FELLOW NEVER COME WHY IT STRUNG ALONG TILL DAWN BEGUN TO BREAK AND STILL HE NEVER COME THUNDER I SAYS

107-22887-0035 SMART WELL I RECKON HE HAD HAD THEM TWO PAPERS ALL FIXED AND READY AND HE HAD PUT ONE OF THEM IN PLACE OF T'OTHER RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES WE FELT PRETTY CHEAP BUT THE THING TO DO STRAIGHT OFF WAS TO MAKE A PLAN AND WE DONE IT WE WOULD DO UP THE PAPER AGAIN
107-22887-0036 JUST AS IT WAS AND SLIP IN VERY ELABORATE AND SOFT AND LAY IT ON THE BUNK AGAIN AND LET ON WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT ANY TRICK AND HADN'T ANY IDEA HE WAS A LAUGHING AT US BEHIND THEM BOGUS SNORES OF HIS'N AND WE WOULD STICK BY HIM
107-22887-0037 AND THE FIRST NIGHT WE WAS ASHORE WE WOULD GET HIM DRUNK AND SEARCH HIM AND GET THE DI'MONDS AND DO FOR HIM TOO IF IT WARN'T TOO RISKY IF WE GOT THE SWAG WE'D GOT TO DO FOR HIM OR HE WOULD HUNT US DOWN AND DO FOR US SURE BUT I DIDN'T HAVE NO REAL HOPE
107-22887-0038 I KNOWED WE COULD GET HIM DRUNK HE WAS ALWAYS READY FOR THAT BUT WHAT'S THE GOOD OF IT YOU MIGHT SEARCH HIM A YEAR AND NEVER FIND WELL RIGHT THERE I CATCHED MY BREATH AND BROKE OFF MY THOUGHT FOR AN IDEA WENT RIPPING THROUGH MY HEAD THAT TORE MY BRAINS TO RAGS
107-22887-0039 AND LAND BUT I FELT GAY AND GOOD YOU SEE I HAD HAD MY BOOTS OFF TO UNSWELL MY FEET AND JUST THEN I TOOK UP ONE OF THEM TO PUT IT ON AND I CATCHED A GLIMPSE OF THE HEEL BOTTOM AND IT JUST TOOK MY BREATH AWAY
107-22887-0040 YOU REMEMBER ABOUT THAT PUZZLESOME LITTLE SCREWDRIVER YOU BET I DO SAYS TOM ALL EXCITED WELL WHEN I CATCHED THAT GLIMPSE OF THAT BOOT HEEL THE IDEA THAT WENT SMASHING THROUGH MY HEAD WAS I KNOW WHERE HE'S HID THE DI'MONDS
107-22887-0041 YOU LOOK AT THIS BOOT HEEL NOW SEE IT'S BOTTOMED WITH A STEEL PLATE AND THE PLATE IS FASTENED ON WITH LITTLE SCREWS NOW THERE WASN'T A SCREW ABOUT THAT FELLER ANYWHERE BUT IN HIS BOOT HEELS SO IF HE NEEDED A SCREWDRIVER I RECKONED I KNOWED WHY
107-22887-0042 WELL I GOT MY BOOTS ON AND WE WENT DOWN AND SLIPPED IN AND LAID THE PAPER OF SUGAR ON THE BERTH AND SAT DOWN SOFT AND SHEEPISH AND WENT TO LISTENING TO BUD DIXON SNORE HAL CLAYTON DROPPED OFF PRETTY SOON BUT I DIDN'T
107-22887-0043 I WASN'T EVER SO WIDE AWAKE IN MY LIFE I WAS SPYING OUT FROM UNDER THE SHADE OF MY HAT BRIM SEARCHING THE FLOOR FOR LEATHER IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME AND I BEGUN TO THINK MAYBE MY GUESS WAS WRONG BUT AT LAST I STRUCK IT IT LAID OVER BY THE BULKHEAD
107-22887-0044 AND WAS NEARLY THE COLOR OF THE CARPET IT WAS A LITTLE ROUND PLUG ABOUT AS THICK AS THE END OF YOUR LITTLE FINGER AND I SAYS TO MYSELF THERE'S A DI'MOND IN THE NEST YOU'VE COME FROM BEFORE LONG I SPIED OUT THE PLUG'S MATE
107-22887-0045 THINK OF THE SMARTNESS AND COOLNESS OF THAT BLATHERSKITE HE PUT UP THAT SCHEME ON US AND REASONED OUT WHAT WE WOULD DO AND WE WENT AHEAD AND DONE IT PERFECTLY EXACT LIKE A COUPLE OF PUDD'NHEADS
