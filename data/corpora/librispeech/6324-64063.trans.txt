6324-64063-0000 REMEMBER THAT PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT SPEAKING OF BRUSH WOLVES THE KIND OF DOG NEEDED IS A GOOD RANGER EXTRA GOOD COLD TRAILER AND AN EVERLASTING STAYER
6324-64063-0001 THEN IF HE WILL ONLY RUN A SHORT DISTANCE AFTER STARTING THE WOLF AND COME BACK AND HUNT THE PUPS AND THEN BARK AT THEM WHEN FOUND YOU HAVE A GOOD VALUABLE DOG
6324-64063-0002 THERE ARE PLENTY OF DOGS THAT WILL HUNT AND TRAIL WOLVES ALL RIGHT BUT VERY FEW THAT WILL HUNT THE PUPS SOMETIMES WHEN YOUR DOG TRAILS IN NEAR THE PUPS YOU WILL GET A FIGHT AND SOMETIMES THEY WILL JUMP OUT AND RUN FOR IT
6324-64063-0003 SOMETIMES IF THE PUPS ARE QUITE YOUNG YOU WILL FIND THE MOTHER IN WITH THEM AND FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS SHE WILL BE FOUND NEAR THEM BUT AS THEY GROW OLDER SHE WILL BE FOUND FARTHER AWAY
6324-64063-0004 A MINNESOTA WOLFER WHO AVERAGES THIRTY FIVE WOLVES A YEAR PINS HIS FAITH IN THE LONG EARED VARIETY OF HOUNDS WITH FEATURES OF STRENGTH ENDURANCE GOOD
6324-64063-0005 BUT DON'T TAKE YOUR DOGS OUT IN SUMMER
6324-64063-0006 AND THERE IS WHERE YOU WILL HURT SOME OF YOUR BEST DOGS I USE A PACK OF FROM THREE TO FIVE BUT THE MORE THE BETTER
6324-64063-0007 I HAVE TRIED MOST ALL KINDS OF DOGS AND HAVE FOUND A CROSS WITH STAG HOUND AND ENGLISH GREYHOUND SUITS ME THE BEST I DON'T HAVE ANY USE FOR A FULL BLOOD ENGLISH GREYHOUND THEY CANNOT STAND THE COLD WEATHER AND ARE TOO EASILY HURT IN A FIGHT
6324-64063-0008 I WANT A DOG THAT WILL WEIGH SEVENTY FIVE POUNDS WITH LONG LEGS AND SHORT BACK SO HE CAN GATHER HIMSELF UP QUICKLY I DON'T THINK FOXHOUNDS ARE ANY GOOD FOR WOLVES I HAVE SEEN THIRTY FIVE OF THEM START AFTER THE SAME WOLF
6324-64063-0009 IN GOOD WEATHER AND FOUR HOURS AFTERWARD THERE WERE ONLY TWO THE SMALLEST OF THE PACK STILL IN THE RACE I HAVE NO DOUBT BUT THAT THEY COULD HAVE TAKEN THE WOLF SEVERAL TIMES IN THE RACE BUT ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO BARK
6324-64063-0010 I WILL NOT SAY A FULL BLOOD STAG HOUND IS NOT ALL RIGHT IN A LEVEL UNOBSTRUCTED COUNTRY BUT IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY MANY LARGE DOGS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET THRU THE FENCES
6324-64063-0011 OR OVER THE ROUGH GROUND WITH THE EASE THAT THE SMALLER ONES DO I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE BIG DOG THAT COULD CATCH AND KILL A WOLF BY HIMSELF I HAVE KILLED THEM WITH TWO BUT WOULD RATHER HAVE FOUR OR FIVE
6324-64063-0012 WELL BROKEN AND NOT AFRAID OF WIRE I NEVER CARRY A GUN OF ANY KIND BUT ALWAYS HAVE A HAMMER AND IF I WANT TO SUCCOR THE DOGS IN THE RACE I WILL RIDE UP TO THE DOGS AND KILL THE WOLF FOR THEM THE IRISH WOLFHOUND
6324-64063-0013 THE IRISH WOLFHOUND OF HISTORY IS NO MORE THE BREED HAVING BECOME EXTINCT YEARS AGO
6324-64063-0014 THE MODERN IRISH WOLFHOUND IS A CROSS BETWEEN THE SCOTTISH DEERHOUND AND THE GREAT DANE OTHER COMBINATIONS HAVE ALSO BEEN TRIED WITH MORE OR LESS GOOD EFFECT ACCORDING TO THE IDEA OF THE AMERICAN IRISH WOLFHOUND CLUB
6324-64063-0015 THE IRISH WOLFHOUND SHOULD BE NOT QUITE SO HEAVY OR MASSIVE AS THE GREAT DANE BUT MORE SO THAN THE DEERHOUND WHICH IN GENERAL TYPE
6324-64063-0016 OF GREAT SIZE AND COMMANDING APPEARANCE VERY MUSCULAR STRONGLY THOUGH GRACEFULLY BUILT MOVEMENTS EASY AND ACTIVE HEAD AND NECK CARRIED HIGH THE TAIL CARRIED WITH AN UPWARD SWEEP
6324-64063-0017 WITH A SLIGHT CURVE TOWARD THE EXTREMITY THE MINIMUM HEIGHT AND WEIGHT OF DOGS SHOULD BE THIRTY ONE INCHES AND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY POUNDS BITCHES TWENTY EIGHT INCHES AND NINETY POUNDS
6324-64063-0018 ANYTHING BELOW THIS SHOULD BE DEBARRED FROM COMPETITION GREAT SIZE INCLUDING HEIGHT AND SHOULDER AND PROPORTIONATE LENGTH OF BODY IS THE DESIDERATUM TO BE AIMED AT AND IT IS DESIRED
6324-64063-0019 TO FIRMLY ESTABLISH A RACE THAT SHALL AVERAGE FROM THIRTY TWO TO THIRTY FOUR INCHES IN DOGS SHOWING THE REQUISITE POWER
6324-64063-0020 OF WAVY OR CURLY HAIR IN GENERAL APPEARANCE SAYS AN AUTHORITY HE IS AN ELEGANT GRACEFUL ARISTOCRAT AMONG DOGS
