4423-29084-0000 WHATEVER THE LAGGING DRAGGING JOURNEY MAY HAVE BEEN TO THE REST OF THE EMIGRANTS IT WAS A WONDER AND DELIGHT TO THE CHILDREN A WORLD OF ENCHANTMENT AND THEY BELIEVED IT TO BE PEOPLED WITH THE MYSTERIOUS DWARFS AND GIANTS AND GOBLINS
4423-29084-0001 THAT FIGURED IN THE TALES THE NEGRO SLAVES WERE IN THE HABIT OF TELLING THEM NIGHTLY BY THE SHUDDERING LIGHT OF THE KITCHEN FIRE AT THE END OF NEARLY A WEEK OF TRAVEL THE PARTY WENT INTO CAMP NEAR A SHABBY VILLAGE WHICH WAS CAVING HOUSE BY HOUSE INTO THE HUNGRY MISSISSIPPI
4423-29084-0002 THE RIVER ASTONISHED THE CHILDREN BEYOND MEASURE ITS MILE BREADTH OF WATER SEEMED AN OCEAN TO THEM IN THE SHADOWY TWILIGHT AND THE VAGUE RIBAND OF TREES ON THE FURTHER SHORE THE VERGE OF A CONTINENT WHICH SURELY NONE BUT THEY HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE UNCLE DAN'L COLORED

4423-29084-0005 A DEEP SILENCE PERVADED THE AIR AND WAS EMPHASIZED AT INTERVALS RATHER THAN BROKEN BY THE HOOTING OF AN OWL THE BAYING OF A DOG
4423-29084-0006 THE LITTLE COMPANY ASSEMBLED ON THE LOG WERE ALL CHILDREN AT LEAST IN SIMPLICITY AND BROAD AND COMPREHENSIVE IGNORANCE AND THE REMARKS THEY MADE ABOUT THE RIVER WERE IN KEEPING WITH THE CHARACTER
4423-29084-0007 AND SO AWED WERE THEY BY THE GRANDEUR AND THE SOLEMNITY OF THE SCENE BEFORE THEM AND BY THEIR BELIEF THAT THE AIR WAS FILLED WITH INVISIBLE SPIRITS AND THAT THE FAINT ZEPHYRS WERE CAUSED BY THEIR PASSING WINGS THAT ALL THEIR TALK TOOK TO ITSELF A TINGE OF THE SUPERNATURAL
