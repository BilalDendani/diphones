7825-258978-0000 IN A PARTICULAR TRADE INTO WHICH MACHINERY IS SUDDENLY INTRODUCED WHEN AS SOMETIMES HAPPENS EMPLOYERS INTRODUCE MACHINES FOR THE IMMEDIATE PURPOSE OF BREAKING A STRIKE THE WORKMEN ARE CONVINCED THAT MACHINERY IS THE ENEMY OF LABOR
7825-258978-0001 BECAUSE THE EXTENSIVE INTRODUCTION OF MACHINERY IN ENGLAND WAS AT FIRST ACCOMPANIED BY THE UNHAPPY RESULT OF A LENGTHENING OF THE HOURS OF LABOR IN FACTORIES THIS RESULT WAS DEEMED TO BE NECESSARY IN ALL OTHER CASES IT WAS IN FACT QUITE ABNORMAL
7825-258978-0002 AND HAS NOT BEEN SEEN ELSEWHERE THE OWNERS OF FACTORIES WISHED TO KEEP THEIR MACHINES EMPLOYED AS MANY HOURS AS POSSIBLE THE LABORING CLASSES OF ENGLAND
7825-258978-0003 BEING AT THE SAME TIME DEMORALIZED AND DEPRESSED BY INDUSTRIAL AND SOCIAL INFLUENCES THAT HAD NO LOGICAL CONNECTION WITH MACHINERY HAD NO POWER TO RESIST THIS MOVEMENT IN ALL OTHER COUNTRIES OF EUROPE AND IN AMERICA
7825-258978-0004 AND WHERE THIS IS COMMON IT IS SPOKEN OF AS THE FACTORY SYSTEM IN THE IDEAL MODERN FACTORY REALIZED IN FEW CASES EACH SMALLER MACHINE IS A PART OF A LARGER ORGANIZATION OF MACHINERY
7825-258978-0005 AND OUT AT THE OTHER WITHOUT THE LOSS OF A SINGLE MOTION FACTORIES COMPEL GREAT NUMBERS OF LABORERS TO LIVE NEAR EACH OTHER AND TO WORK TOGETHER THE SUDDEN CROWDING TOGETHER OF PEOPLE INTO NEW SOCIAL RELATIONS IS USUALLY BAD FOR MORALS
7825-258978-0006 MEN ARE MORAL UNDER THE EYES OF THEIR NEIGHBORS ACQUAINTANCES AND FAMILIES HABITS BECOME ADJUSTED TO RIGHT STANDARDS AND THE TEMPTATIONS IN NEW CONDITIONS ARE ALWAYS GREAT UNTIL OF LATE
7825-258978-0007 AND THE EARLY FACTORIES WITH THEIR SURROUNDINGS WERE MOST UNSANITARY UNDER THE DEGRADING CONDITIONS THAT RESULTED IN SOME PLACES
7825-258978-0008 WHETHER THIS IS ITS NATURAL RESULT IS DEBATABLE BUT THE FACTORY WORKER IN GENERAL DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE LESS INTELLIGENT THAN THE AGRICULTURAL WORKER THE ALERTNESS OF THE CITY DWELLER IS DUE DOUBTLESS TO SOCIAL CONTACT MORE THAN TO THE IMMEDIATE WORK HE DOES
7825-258978-0009 THIS WORK MAY OR MAY NOT BE LESS THOUGHT AWAKENING THAN WORK WITH SIMPLE TOOLS THERE IS A GENERAL IMPROVEMENT ALONG ALL THE LINES OF INTELLIGENCE MORALS
