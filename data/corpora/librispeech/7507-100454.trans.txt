7507-100454-0000 AS EVERYBODY KNOWS OR WILL KNOW WHEN THEY HAVE READ THIS ARTICLE THE FOUR STAGES ALONG THE ROAD TO LITERARY FAME ARE MARKED BY THE FOUR DIFFERENT MANNERS
7507-100454-0001 IN WHICH THE TRAVELLER'S PRESENCE AT A PUBLIC FUNCTION IS RECORDED IN THE PRESS AT THE FIRST STAGE THE REPORTER GLANCES AT THE LIST OF GUESTS AND SAYS TO HIMSELF MISTER GEORGE MEREDITH
7507-100454-0002 NEVER HEARD OF HIM AND FOR ALL THE WORLD KNOWS NEXT MORNING
7507-100454-0003 THE REPORTER MURMURS TO HIS NEIGHBOUR IN A PUZZLED SORT OF WAY GEORGE MEREDITH
7507-100454-0004 NOW WHERE HAVE I COME ACROSS THAT NAME LATELY WASN'T HE THE MAN WHO PUSHED A WHEELBARROW ACROSS AMERICA
7507-100454-0005 HE SAYS THE GUESTS INCLUDED MISTER GEORGE MEREDITH AND MANY OTHERS
7507-100454-0006 HAVING SEEN AN ADVERTISEMENT OF ONE OF HIS BOOKS AND BEING PRETTY SURE THAT THE PUBLIC HAS READ NONE OF THEM HE REFERS TO HIM AS MISTER GEORGE MEREDITH THE WELL KNOWN NOVELIST
7507-100454-0007 THE FOURTH AND FINAL STAGE BEYOND THE REACH OF ALL BUT THE FAVOURED FEW
7507-100454-0008 TO HIS PUBLIC UNTICKETED AND SAYS AGAIN AMONG THOSE PRESENT WAS MISTER GEORGE MEREDITH THE THIRD STAGE IS EASY TO REACH INDEED TOO EASY THE WELL KNOWN ACTRESSES
7507-100454-0009 ARE NOT ELLEN TERRY
7507-100454-0010 AND MARIE TEMPEST BUT MISS BIRDIE
7507-100454-0011 WHO HAS DISCOVERED A NEW WAY OF DARKENING THE HAIR AND MISS GIRLIE DE TRACY WHO HAS BEEN ARRESTED FOR SHOP LIFTING IN THE SAME WAY THE MORE THE PRESS INSISTS THAT A WRITER IS
7507-100454-0012 BETTER FAR TO REMAIN AT THE SECOND STAGE AND TO FLATTER ONESELF THAT ONE HAS REALLY ARRIVED AT THE FOURTH BUT MY FRIEND SIDNEY MANDRAGON IS INDEED AT THE FINAL STAGE NOW
7507-100454-0013 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY MILTON AND NOT EXACTLY CARLYLE
7507-100454-0014 I FELT THAT I COULD NOT TAKE THE RISK OF REFUSING IT MYSELF THIS IS A GOOD MAN I WOULD SAY BEFORE BEGINNING HIS ARTICLE THIS MAN OBVIOUSLY HAS STYLE AND I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
7507-100454-0015 WELL TAKE MISTER HUGH WALPOLE IF HE WILL ALLOW ME IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT WHEN MISTER WALPOLE'S FIRST BOOK CAME OUT THE AVERAGE READER FELT VAGUELY THAT SHE HAD HEARD OF HIM BEFORE
7507-100454-0016 SHE HADN'T ACTUALLY READ HIS FAMOUS LETTERS BUT SHE HAD OFTEN WANTED TO
7507-100454-0017 OR WAS THAT HIS UNCLE ANYWAY SHE HAD OFTEN HEARD PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HIM WHAT A VERY TALENTED FAMILY IT WAS IN THE SAME WAY SIDNEY MANDRAGON HAS HAD
7507-100454-0018 ANOTHER HALL MARK BY WHICH WE CAN TELL WHETHER A MAN HAS ARRIVED OR NOT IS PROVIDED BY THE INTERVIEW IF SAY A LEPIDOPTERIST IS JUST BEGINNING HIS CAREER
7507-100454-0019 NOBODY BOTHERS ABOUT HIS OPINIONS ON ANYTHING IF HE IS MODERATELY WELL KNOWN IN HIS PROFESSION THE PAPERS WILL SEEK HIS HELP WHENEVER HIS OWN PARTICULAR SUBJECT COMES UP
7507-100454-0020 IN THE DAY'S NEWS THERE IS A SUGGESTION PERHAPS IN PARLIAMENT THAT BUTTERFLIES SHOULD BE MUZZLED AND OUR REPRESENTATIVE
7507-100454-0021 WHAT THE WORLD IS EAGER FOR NOW IS TO BE TOLD HIS VIEWS ON SUNDAY GAMES THE DECADENCE OF THE THEATRE OR BANDS IN THE PARKS
7507-100454-0022 THE MODERN ADVERTISING PROVIDES A NEW SCALE OF VALUES NO DOUBT MISTER PELMAN OFFERS HIS CELEBRATED HUNDRED GUINEAS FEE EQUALLY TO ALL HIS VICTIMS BUT WE MAY BE PRETTY SURE
7507-100454-0023 THAT IN HIS BUSINESS LIKE BRAIN HE HAS EACH ONE OF THEM NICELY LABELLED A GALLANT SOLDIER BEING GOOD FOR SO MUCH NEW BUSINESS A TITLED MAN OF LETTERS
