4973-44575-0000 CHAPTER ONE ACQUIRING CONFIDENCE BEFORE AN AUDIENCE THERE IS A STRANGE SENSATION OFTEN EXPERIENCED IN THE PRESENCE OF AN AUDIENCE IT MAY PROCEED FROM THE GAZE OF THE MANY EYES THAT TURN UPON THE SPEAKER
4973-44575-0001 STUDENTS OF PUBLIC SPEAKING CONTINUALLY ASK HOW CAN I OVERCOME SELF CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE FEAR THAT PARALYZES ME BEFORE AN AUDIENCE DID YOU EVER NOTICE IN LOOKING FROM A TRAIN WINDOW THAT SOME HORSES FEED NEAR THE TRACK AND NEVER EVEN PAUSE TO LOOK UP AT THE THUNDERING CARS
4973-44575-0002 WHILE JUST AHEAD AT THE NEXT RAILROAD CROSSING A FARMER'S WIFE
4973-44575-0003 GRAZE HIM IN A BACK WOODS LOT WHERE HE WOULD NEVER SEE STEAM ENGINES OR AUTOMOBILES OR DRIVE OR PASTURE HIM WHERE HE WOULD FREQUENTLY SEE THE MACHINES APPLY HORSE SENSE TO RIDDING YOURSELF OF SELF CONSCIOUSNESS AND FEAR FACE AN AUDIENCE AS FREQUENTLY AS YOU CAN
4973-44575-0004 AND YOU WILL SOON STOP SHYING YOU CAN NEVER ATTAIN FREEDOM FROM STAGE FRIGHT BY READING A TREATISE
4973-44575-0005 BUT SOONER OR LATER YOU MUST GET WET PERHAPS EVEN STRANGLE AND BE HALF SCARED TO DEATH
4973-44575-0006 ALL WE CAN DO HERE IS TO OFFER YOU SUGGESTIONS AS TO HOW BEST TO PREPARE FOR YOUR PLUNGE THE REAL PLUNGE NO ONE CAN TAKE FOR YOU A DOCTOR MAY PRESCRIBE BUT YOU MUST TAKE THE MEDICINE DO NOT BE DISHEARTENED IF AT FIRST YOU SUFFER FROM STAGE FRIGHT
4973-44575-0007 DAN PATCH WAS MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SUFFERING THAN A SUPERANNUATED DRAY HORSE WOULD BE IT NEVER HURTS A FOOL TO APPEAR BEFORE AN AUDIENCE FOR HIS CAPACITY IS NOT A CAPACITY FOR FEELING A BLOW THAT WOULD KILL A CIVILIZED MAN SOON HEALS ON A SAVAGE
4973-44575-0008 THE HIGHER WE GO IN THE SCALE OF LIFE THE GREATER IS THE CAPACITY FOR SUFFERING FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER SOME MASTER SPEAKERS NEVER ENTIRELY OVERCOME STAGE FRIGHT BUT IT WILL PAY YOU TO SPARE NO PAINS TO CONQUER IT
4973-44575-0009 DANIEL WEBSTER FAILED IN HIS FIRST APPEARANCE AND HAD TO TAKE HIS SEAT WITHOUT FINISHING HIS SPEECH BECAUSE HE WAS NERVOUS
4973-44575-0010 IN THE BEGINNING OF AN ADDRESS BEECHER WAS ALWAYS PERTURBED BEFORE TALKING IN PUBLIC BLACKSMITHS SOMETIMES TWIST A ROPE TIGHT AROUND THE NOSE OF A HORSE AND BY THUS INFLICTING A LITTLE PAIN THEY DISTRACT HIS ATTENTION FROM THE SHOEING PROCESS
4973-44575-0011 LIKE THE INFILLING WATER IN THE GLASS IT WILL DRIVE OUT YOUR UNSUBSTANTIAL FEARS SELF CONSCIOUSNESS IS UNDUE CONSCIOUSNESS OF SELF AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF DELIVERY SELF IS SECONDARY TO YOUR SUBJECT NOT ONLY IN THE OPINION OF THE AUDIENCE BUT IF YOU ARE WISE IN YOUR OWN
4973-44575-0012 TO HOLD ANY OTHER VIEW IS TO REGARD YOURSELF AS AN EXHIBIT INSTEAD OF AS A MESSENGER WITH A MESSAGE WORTH DELIVERING DO YOU REMEMBER ELBERT HUBBARD'S TREMENDOUS LITTLE TRACT A MESSAGE TO GARCIA THE YOUTH SUBORDINATED HIMSELF TO THE MESSAGE HE BORE
4973-44575-0013 IT IS SHEER EGOTISM TO FILL YOUR MIND WITH THOUGHTS OF SELF WHEN A GREATER THING IS THERE TRUTH SAY THIS TO YOURSELF STERNLY AND SHAME YOUR SELF CONSCIOUSNESS INTO QUIESCENCE
4973-44575-0014 IF THE THEATER CAUGHT FIRE YOU COULD RUSH TO THE STAGE AND SHOUT DIRECTIONS TO THE AUDIENCE WITHOUT ANY SELF CONSCIOUSNESS FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT YOU WERE SAYING WOULD DRIVE ALL FEAR THOUGHTS OUT OF YOUR MIND
4973-44575-0015 FAR WORSE THAN SELF CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGH FEAR OF DOING POORLY IS SELF CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGH ASSUMPTION OF DOING WELL THE FIRST SIGN OF GREATNESS IS WHEN A MAN DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO LOOK AND ACT GREAT BEFORE YOU CAN CALL YOURSELF A MAN AT ALL
4973-44575-0016 KIPLING ASSURES US YOU MUST NOT LOOK TOO GOOD NOR TALK TOO WISE NOTHING ADVERTISES ITSELF SO THOROUGHLY AS CONCEIT ONE MAY BE SO FULL OF SELF AS TO BE EMPTY VOLTAIRE SAID WE MUST CONCEAL SELF LOVE BUT THAT CAN NOT BE DONE
4973-44575-0017 YOU KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE FOR YOU HAVE RECOGNIZED OVERWEENING SELF LOVE IN OTHERS IF YOU HAVE IT OTHERS ARE SEEING IT IN YOU THERE ARE THINGS IN THIS WORLD BIGGER THAN SELF
4973-44575-0018 OR WHAT IS BETTER REMEMBERED ONLY SO AS TO HELP US WIN TOWARD HIGHER THINGS HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY THE TROUBLE WITH MANY SPEAKERS IS THAT THEY GO BEFORE AN AUDIENCE WITH THEIR MINDS A BLANK IT IS NO WONDER THAT NATURE ABHORRING A VACUUM FILLS THEM WITH THE NEAREST THING HANDY
4973-44575-0019 WHICH GENERALLY HAPPENS TO BE I WONDER IF I AM DOING THIS RIGHT HOW DOES MY HAIR LOOK I KNOW I SHALL FAIL THEIR PROPHETIC SOULS ARE SURE TO BE RIGHT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO BE ABSORBED BY YOUR SUBJECT TO ACQUIRE SELF CONFIDENCE YOU MUST HAVE SOMETHING IN WHICH TO BE CONFIDENT
4973-44575-0020 IF YOU GO BEFORE AN AUDIENCE WITHOUT ANY PREPARATION OR PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR SUBJECT YOU OUGHT TO BE SELF CONSCIOUS YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED TO STEAL THE TIME OF YOUR AUDIENCE PREPARE YOURSELF KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT AND IN GENERAL HOW YOU ARE GOING TO SAY IT
4973-44575-0021 HAVE THE FIRST FEW SENTENCES WORKED OUT COMPLETELY SO THAT YOU MAY NOT BE TROUBLED IN THE BEGINNING TO FIND WORDS KNOW YOUR SUBJECT BETTER THAN YOUR HEARERS KNOW IT AND YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR AFTER PREPARING FOR SUCCESS EXPECT IT
4973-44575-0022 LET YOUR BEARING BE MODESTLY CONFIDENT BUT MOST OF ALL BE MODESTLY CONFIDENT WITHIN OVER CONFIDENCE IS BAD BUT TO TOLERATE PREMONITIONS OF FAILURE IS WORSE FOR A BOLD MAN MAY WIN ATTENTION BY HIS VERY BEARING
4973-44575-0023 HUMILITY IS NOT THE PERSONAL DISCOUNT THAT WE MUST OFFER IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHERS AGAINST THIS OLD INTERPRETATION THERE HAS BEEN A MOST HEALTHY MODERN REACTION TRUE HUMILITY ANY MAN WHO THOROUGHLY KNOWS HIMSELF MUST FEEL
4973-44575-0024 IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS SPEECH IRVING HESITATED BECAME EMBARRASSED AND SAT DOWN AWKWARDLY TURNING TO A FRIEND BESIDE HIM HE REMARKED
4973-44575-0025 IF YOU BELIEVE YOU WILL FAIL THERE IS NO HOPE FOR YOU YOU WILL RID YOURSELF OF THIS I AM A POOR WORM IN THE DUST IDEA YOU ARE A GOD WITH INFINITE CAPABILITIES ALL THINGS ARE READY IF THE MIND BE SO
4973-44575-0026 AND REMEMBER THAT THOUGH YOUR AUDIENCE IS INFINITELY MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU THE TRUTH IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN BOTH OF YOU BECAUSE IT IS ETERNAL IF YOUR MIND FALTERS IN ITS LEADERSHIP THE SWORD WILL DROP FROM YOUR HANDS
4973-44575-0027 YOUR ASSUMPTION OF BEING ABLE TO INSTRUCT OR LEAD OR INSPIRE A MULTITUDE OR EVEN A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE MAY APPALL YOU AS BEING COLOSSAL IMPUDENCE AS INDEED IT MAY BE BUT HAVING ONCE ESSAYED TO SPEAK BE COURAGEOUS BE COURAGEOUS IT LIES WITHIN YOU TO BE WHAT YOU WILL
4973-44575-0028 MAKE YOURSELF BE CALM AND CONFIDENT REFLECT THAT YOUR AUDIENCE WILL NOT HURT YOU IF BEECHER IN LIVERPOOL HAD SPOKEN BEHIND A WIRE SCREEN HE WOULD HAVE INVITED THE AUDIENCE TO THROW THE OVER RIPE MISSILES WITH WHICH THEY WERE LOADED
4973-44575-0029 BUT HE WAS A MAN CONFRONTED HIS HOSTILE HEARERS FEARLESSLY AND WON THEM IN FACING YOUR AUDIENCE PAUSE A MOMENT AND LOOK THEM OVER A HUNDRED CHANCES TO ONE THEY WANT YOU TO SUCCEED FOR WHAT MAN IS SO FOOLISH AS TO SPEND HIS TIME PERHAPS HIS MONEY
4973-44575-0030 IN THE HOPE THAT YOU WILL WASTE HIS INVESTMENT BY TALKING DULLY CONCLUDING HINTS DO NOT MAKE HASTE TO BEGIN HASTE SHOWS LACK OF CONTROL DO NOT APOLOGIZE IT OUGHT NOT TO BE NECESSARY AND IF IT IS IT WILL NOT HELP
4973-44575-0031 GO STRAIGHT AHEAD TAKE A DEEP BREATH RELAX AND BEGIN IN A QUIET CONVERSATIONAL TONE AS THOUGH YOU WERE SPEAKING TO ONE LARGE FRIEND YOU WILL NOT FIND IT HALF SO BAD AS YOU IMAGINED REALLY IT IS LIKE TAKING A COLD PLUNGE AFTER YOU ARE IN
4973-44575-0032 THE WATER IS FINE IN FACT HAVING SPOKEN A FEW TIMES YOU WILL EVEN ANTICIPATE THE PLUNGE WITH EXHILARATION TO STAND BEFORE AN AUDIENCE AND MAKE THEM THINK YOUR THOUGHTS AFTER YOU IS ONE OF THE GREATEST PLEASURES YOU CAN EVER KNOW
4973-44575-0033 INSTEAD OF FEARING IT YOU OUGHT TO BE AS ANXIOUS AS THE FOX HOUNDS STRAINING AT THEIR LEASHES OR THE RACE HORSES TUGGING AT THEIR REINS SO CAST OUT FEAR FOR FEAR IS COWARDLY WHEN IT IS NOT MASTERED THE BRAVEST KNOW FEAR BUT THEY DO NOT YIELD TO IT
4973-44575-0034 FACE YOUR AUDIENCE PLUCKILY IF YOUR KNEES QUAKE MAKE THEM STOP IN YOUR AUDIENCE LIES SOME VICTORY FOR YOU AND THE CAUSE YOU REPRESENT GO WIN IT SUPPOSE CHARLES MARTELL HAD BEEN AFRAID TO HAMMER THE SARACEN AT TOURS
4973-44575-0035 SUPPOSE OUR FOREFATHERS HAD BEEN TOO TIMID TO OPPOSE THE TYRANNY OF GEORGE THE THIRD SUPPOSE THAT ANY MAN WHO EVER DID ANYTHING WORTH WHILE HAD BEEN A COWARD THE WORLD OWES ITS PROGRESS TO THE MEN WHO HAVE DARED AND YOU MUST DARE TO SPEAK THE EFFECTIVE WORD THAT IS IN YOUR HEART TO SPEAK
4973-44575-0036 FOR OFTEN IT REQUIRES COURAGE TO UTTER A SINGLE SENTENCE BUT REMEMBER THAT MEN ERECT NO MONUMENTS AND WEAVE NO LAURELS FOR THOSE WHO FEAR TO DO WHAT THEY CAN IS ALL THIS UNSYMPATHETIC DO YOU SAY MAN WHAT YOU NEED IS NOT SYMPATHY BUT A PUSH
4973-44575-0037 NO ONE DOUBTS THAT TEMPERAMENT AND NERVES AND ILLNESS AND EVEN PRAISEWORTHY MODESTY MAY SINGLY OR COMBINED CAUSE THE SPEAKER'S CHEEK TO BLANCH BEFORE AN AUDIENCE
4973-44575-0038 THE VICTORY LIES IN A FEARLESS FRAME OF MIND PROFESSOR WALTER DILL SCOTT SAYS SUCCESS OR FAILURE IN BUSINESS IS CAUSED MORE BY MENTAL ATTITUDE EVEN THAN BY MENTAL CAPACITY BANISH THE FEAR ATTITUDE ACQUIRE THE CONFIDENT ATTITUDE
4973-44575-0039 AND REMEMBER THAT THE ONLY WAY TO ACQUIRE IT IS TO ACQUIRE IT IN THIS FOUNDATION CHAPTER WE HAVE TRIED TO STRIKE THE TONE OF MUCH THAT IS TO FOLLOW MANY OF THESE IDEAS WILL BE AMPLIFIED AND ENFORCED IN A MORE SPECIFIC WAY
