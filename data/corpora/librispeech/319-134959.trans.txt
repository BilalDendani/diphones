319-134959-0000 HER MOTHER WHO SINCE THE DEATH OF THE KING HER FATHER HAD NOTHING IN THE WORLD SHE CARED FOR SO MUCH AS THIS LITTLE PRINCESS WAS SO TERRIBLY AFRAID OF LOSING HER THAT SHE QUITE SPOILED HER
319-134959-0001 AND NEVER TRIED TO CORRECT ANY OF HER FAULTS THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THIS LITTLE PERSON WHO WAS AS PRETTY AS POSSIBLE AND WAS ONE DAY TO WEAR A CROWN
319-134959-0002 GREW UP SO PROUD AND SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER OWN BEAUTY THAT SHE DESPISED EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD THE QUEEN HER MOTHER BY HER CARESSES AND FLATTERIES HELPED TO MAKE HER BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TOO GOOD FOR HER
319-134959-0003 SHE WAS DRESSED ALMOST ALWAYS IN THE PRETTIEST FROCKS AS A FAIRY OR AS A QUEEN GOING OUT TO HUNT AND THE LADIES OF THE COURT FOLLOWED HER DRESSED AS FOREST FAIRIES AND TO MAKE HER MORE VAIN THAN EVER
319-134959-0004 THE QUEEN CAUSED HER PORTRAIT TO BE TAKEN BY THE CLEVEREST PAINTERS AND SENT IT TO SEVERAL NEIGHBORING KINGS WITH WHOM SHE WAS VERY FRIENDLY
319-134959-0005 EVERY ONE OF THEM BUT UPON EACH IT HAD A DIFFERENT EFFECT ONE FELL ILL ONE WENT QUITE CRAZY
319-134959-0006 NEVER HAS THERE BEEN A GAYER COURT TWENTY DELIGHTFUL KINGS DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD THINK OF TO MAKE THEMSELVES AGREEABLE AND AFTER HAVING SPENT EVER SO MUCH MONEY IN GIVING A SINGLE ENTERTAINMENT
319-134959-0007 THOUGHT THEMSELVES VERY LUCKY IF THE PRINCESS SAID THAT'S PRETTY ALL THIS ADMIRATION VASTLY PLEASED THE QUEEN NOT A DAY PASSED BUT SHE RECEIVED SEVEN OR EIGHT THOUSAND SONNETS
319-134959-0008 AND AS MANY ELEGIES MADRIGALS AND SONGS WHICH WERE SENT HER BY ALL THE POETS IN THE WORLD
319-134959-0009 WAS ABOUT BELLISSIMA FOR THAT WAS THE PRINCESS'S NAME AND ALL THE BONFIRES THAT THEY HAD WERE MADE OF THESE VERSES WHICH CRACKLED AND SPARKLED BETTER THAN ANY OTHER SORT OF WOOD BELLISSIMA WAS ALREADY FIFTEEN YEARS OLD
319-134959-0010 AND EVERY ONE OF THE PRINCES WISHED TO MARRY HER
319-134959-0011 FIVE OR SIX TIMES A DAY JUST TO PLEASE HER
319-134959-0012 SO LITTLE DID SHE CARE YOU MAY IMAGINE HOW HARD HEARTED HER LOVERS THOUGHT HER AND THE QUEEN WHO WISHED TO SEE HER MARRIED DID NOT KNOW HOW TO PERSUADE HER TO THINK OF IT SERIOUSLY BELLISSIMA SHE SAID I
319-134959-0013 DO WISH YOU WOULD NOT BE SO PROUD WHAT MAKES YOU DESPISE ALL THESE NICE KINGS I WISH YOU TO MARRY ONE OF THEM AND YOU DO NOT TRY TO PLEASE ME I AM SO HAPPY BELLISSIMA ANSWERED
319-134959-0014 DO LEAVE ME IN PEACE MADAM I DON'T WANT TO CARE FOR ANYONE BUT YOU WOULD BE VERY HAPPY WITH ANY OF THESE PRINCES SAID THE QUEEN
319-134959-0015 AND I SHALL BE VERY ANGRY IF YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH ANYONE WHO IS NOT WORTHY OF YOU BUT THE PRINCESS THOUGHT SO MUCH OF HERSELF THAT SHE DID NOT CONSIDER ANY ONE OF HER LOVERS CLEVER OR HANDSOME ENOUGH FOR HER
319-134959-0016 AND HER MOTHER WHO WAS GETTING REALLY ANGRY AT HER DETERMINATION NOT TO BE MARRIED BEGAN TO WISH THAT SHE HAD NOT ALLOWED HER TO HAVE HER OWN WAY SO MUCH AT LAST NOT KNOWING WHAT ELSE TO DO
319-134959-0017 NOW THIS WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO AS SHE WAS GUARDED BY SOME TERRIBLE LIONS BUT HAPPILY THE QUEEN HAD HEARD A LONG TIME BEFORE THAT WHOEVER WANTED TO PASS THESE LIONS SAFELY MUST THROW TO THEM A CAKE MADE OF MILLET FLOUR
319-134959-0018 SUGAR CANDY AND CROCODILE'S EGGS THIS CAKE SHE PREPARED WITH HER OWN HANDS AND PUTTING IT IN A LITTLE BASKET SHE SET OUT TO SEEK THE FAIRY BUT AS SHE WAS NOT USED TO WALKING FAR
319-134959-0019 SHE SOON FELT VERY TIRED AND SAT DOWN AT THE FOOT OF A TREE TO REST AND PRESENTLY FELL FAST ASLEEP WHEN SHE AWOKE SHE WAS DISMAYED TO FIND HER BASKET EMPTY THE CAKE WAS ALL GONE AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE
319-134959-0020 AT THAT MOMENT SHE HEARD THE ROARING OF THE GREAT LIONS WHO HAD FOUND OUT THAT SHE WAS NEAR AND WERE COMING TO LOOK FOR HER
319-134959-0021 I SHALL BE EATEN UP AND BEING TOO FRIGHTENED TO RUN A SINGLE STEP SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND LEANED AGAINST THE TREE UNDER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ASLEEP
319-134959-0022 AND THEN UP THE TREE AND THERE SHE SAW A LITTLE TINY MAN WHO WAS EATING ORANGES OH QUEEN SAID HE I KNOW YOU VERY WELL AND I KNOW HOW MUCH AFRAID YOU ARE OF THE LIONS
319-134959-0023 AND YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT TOO FOR THEY HAVE EATEN MANY OTHER PEOPLE
319-134959-0024 I MUST MAKE UP MY MIND TO DIE SAID THE POOR QUEEN ALAS I SHOULD NOT CARE SO MUCH IF ONLY MY DEAR DAUGHTER WERE MARRIED OH YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER CRIED THE YELLOW DWARF
319-134959-0025 WHO WAS SO CALLED BECAUSE HE WAS A DWARF AND HAD SUCH A YELLOW FACE AND LIVED IN THE ORANGE TREE I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR THAT FOR I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A WIFE ALL OVER THE WORLD NOW IF YOU WILL PROMISE THAT SHE SHALL MARRY ME
319-134959-0026 NOT ONE OF THE LIONS TIGERS OR BEARS SHALL TOUCH YOU THE QUEEN LOOKED AT HIM AND WAS ALMOST AS MUCH AFRAID OF HIS UGLY LITTLE FACE AS SHE HAD BEEN OF THE LIONS BEFORE SO THAT SHE COULD NOT SPEAK A WORD
319-134959-0027 YOU HESITATE MADAM CRIED THE DWARF
319-134959-0028 AND AS HE SPOKE THE QUEEN SAW THE LIONS WHICH WERE RUNNING DOWN A HILL TOWARD THEM EACH ONE HAD TWO HEADS EIGHT FEET AND FOUR ROWS OF TEETH
319-134959-0029 AND WERE BRIGHT RED AT THIS DREADFUL SIGHT THE POOR QUEEN WHO WAS TREMBLING LIKE A DOVE WHEN IT SEES A HAWK CRIED OUT AS LOUD AS SHE COULD
319-134959-0030 BELLISSIMA SHALL MARRY YOU
319-134959-0031 BELLISSIMA IS PRETTY ENOUGH BUT I DON'T PARTICULARLY WANT TO MARRY HER YOU CAN KEEP HER OH NOBLE SIR SAID THE QUEEN IN GREAT DISTRESS DO NOT REFUSE HER
319-134959-0032 OUT OF CHARITY I WILL TAKE HER BUT BE SURE AND DON'T FORGET THAT SHE IS MINE AS HE SPOKE A LITTLE DOOR OPENED IN THE TRUNK OF THE ORANGE TREE
319-134959-0033 THE QUEEN WAS SO CONFUSED THAT AT FIRST SHE DID NOT NOTICE ANOTHER LITTLE DOOR IN THE ORANGE TREE BUT PRESENTLY IT OPENED AND SHE FOUND HERSELF IN A FIELD OF THISTLES AND NETTLES IT WAS ENCIRCLED BY A MUDDY DITCH
319-134959-0034 AND A LITTLE FURTHER ON WAS A TINY THATCHED COTTAGE OUT OF WHICH CAME THE YELLOW DWARF WITH A VERY JAUNTY AIR
319-134959-0035 AND AS HE HAD NO HAIR AND VERY LONG EARS HE LOOKED ALTOGETHER A SHOCKING LITTLE OBJECT I AM DELIGHTED
319-134959-0036 WITH THESE THISTLES AND NETTLES SHE CAN FEED A DONKEY WHICH SHE CAN RIDE WHENEVER SHE LIKES UNDER THIS HUMBLE ROOF NO WEATHER CAN HURT HER SHE WILL DRINK THE WATER OF THIS BROOK AND EAT FROGS WHICH GROW VERY FAT ABOUT HERE
319-134959-0037 AND THEN SHE WILL HAVE ME ALWAYS WITH HER HANDSOME AGREEABLE AND GAY AS YOU SEE ME NOW FOR IF HER SHADOW STAYS BY HER MORE CLOSELY THAN I DO I SHALL BE SURPRISED
319-134959-0038 THE UNHAPPY QUEEN SEEING ALL AT ONCE WHAT A MISERABLE LIFE HER DAUGHTER WOULD HAVE WITH THIS DWARF COULD NOT BEAR THE IDEA AND FELL DOWN INSENSIBLE WITHOUT SAYING A WORD WHEN SHE REVIVED
319-134959-0039 SHE FOUND TO HER GREAT SURPRISE THAT SHE WAS LYING IN HER OWN BED AT HOME AND WHAT WAS MORE THAT SHE HAD ON THE LOVELIEST LACE NIGHT CAP THAT SHE HAD EVER SEEN IN HER LIFE AT FIRST SHE THOUGHT THAT ALL HER ADVENTURES
319-134959-0040 THE TERRIBLE LIONS AND HER PROMISE TO THE YELLOW DWARF THAT HE SHOULD MARRY BELLISSIMA MUST HAVE BEEN A DREAM BUT THERE WAS THE NEW CAP WITH ITS BEAUTIFUL RIBBON AND LACE TO REMIND HER THAT IT WAS ALL TRUE WHICH MADE HER SO UNHAPPY
319-134959-0041 THAT SHE COULD NEITHER EAT DRINK NOR SLEEP FOR THINKING OF IT THE PRINCESS WHO IN SPITE OF HER WILFULNESS REALLY LOVED HER MOTHER WITH ALL HER HEART WAS MUCH GRIEVED WHEN SHE SAW HER LOOKING SO SAD AND OFTEN ASKED HER WHAT WAS THE MATTER
319-134959-0042 BUT THE QUEEN WHO DIDN'T WANT HER TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH ONLY SAID THAT SHE WAS ILL OR THAT ONE OF HER NEIGHBORS WAS THREATENING TO MAKE WAR AGAINST HER BELLISSIMA KNEW QUITE WELL THAT SOMETHING WAS BEING HIDDEN FROM HER
319-134959-0043 AND THAT NEITHER OF THESE WAS THE REAL REASON OF THE QUEEN'S UNEASINESS SO SHE MADE UP HER MIND THAT SHE WOULD GO AND CONSULT THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT ABOUT IT ESPECIALLY AS SHE HAD OFTEN HEARD HOW WISE SHE WAS
319-134959-0044 OR NOT SO WITH GREAT CARE SHE MADE SOME OF THE PROPER CAKE TO PACIFY THE LIONS
319-134959-0045 PRETENDING THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BED BUT INSTEAD OF THAT SHE WRAPPED HERSELF IN A LONG WHITE VEIL AND WENT DOWN A SECRET STAIRCASE AND SET OFF ALL BY HERSELF TO FIND THE WITCH BUT WHEN SHE GOT AS FAR AS THE SAME FATAL ORANGE TREE
319-134959-0046 AND SAW IT COVERED WITH FLOWERS AND FRUIT SHE STOPPED AND BEGAN TO GATHER SOME OF THE ORANGES AND THEN PUTTING DOWN HER BASKET SHE SAT DOWN TO EAT THEM BUT WHEN IT WAS TIME TO GO ON AGAIN THE BASKET HAD DISAPPEARED AND THOUGH SHE LOOKED EVERYWHERE
319-134959-0047 NOT A TRACE OF IT COULD SHE FIND THE MORE SHE HUNTED FOR IT THE MORE FRIGHTENED SHE GOT AND AT LAST SHE BEGAN TO CRY THEN ALL AT ONCE SHE SAW BEFORE HER THE YELLOW DWARF WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU MY PRETTY ONE SAID HE
319-134959-0048 WHAT ARE YOU CRYING ABOUT
319-134959-0049 SEEING THAT I HAVE LOST THE BASKET OF CAKE
319-134959-0050 AND WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH HER PRETTY ONE SAID THE LITTLE MONSTER FOR I AM A FRIEND OF HERS AND FOR THE MATTER OF THAT I AM QUITE AS CLEVER AS SHE IS THE QUEEN MY MOTHER REPLIED THE PRINCESS
319-134959-0051 THAT I FEAR THAT SHE WILL DIE AND I AM AFRAID THAT PERHAPS I AM THE CAUSE OF IT FOR SHE VERY MUCH WISHES ME TO BE MARRIED
319-134959-0052 SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS I WISHED TO TALK TO THE FAIRY DO NOT GIVE YOURSELF ANY FURTHER TROUBLE PRINCESS ANSWERED THE DWARF I CAN TELL YOU ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW BETTER THAN SHE COULD
319-134959-0053 THE QUEEN YOUR MOTHER HAS PROMISED YOU IN MARRIAGE HAS PROMISED ME INTERRUPTED THE PRINCESS OH NO I'M SURE SHE HAS NOT
319-134959-0054 I AM TOO MUCH INTERESTED IN THE MATTER FOR HER TO PROMISE ANYTHING WITHOUT MY CONSENT YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS CRIED THE DWARF SUDDENLY
319-134959-0055 I FLATTER MYSELF THAT YOU WILL NOT BE DISPLEASED AT HER CHOICE WHEN I TELL YOU
319-134959-0056 YOU CRIED BELLISSIMA STARTING BACK MY MOTHER
319-134959-0057 CRIED THE DWARF ANGRILY BUT HERE ARE THE LIONS COMING THEY'LL EAT YOU UP IN THREE MOUTHFULS AND THERE WILL BE AN END OF YOU AND YOUR PRIDE AND INDEED AT THAT MOMENT THE POOR PRINCESS HEARD THEIR DREADFUL HOWLS COMING NEARER
319-134959-0058 AND NEARER WHAT SHALL I DO SHE CRIED MUST ALL MY HAPPY DAYS COME TO AN END LIKE THIS THE MALICIOUS DWARF LOOKED AT HER AND BEGAN TO LAUGH SPITEFULLY AT LEAST SAID HE
319-134959-0059 YOU HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF DYING UNMARRIED A LOVELY PRINCESS LIKE YOU MUST SURELY PREFER TO DIE RATHER THAN BE THE WIFE OF A POOR LITTLE DWARF LIKE MYSELF OH DON'T BE ANGRY WITH ME CRIED THE PRINCESS CLASPING HER HANDS
319-134959-0060 LOOK AT ME WELL PRINCESS BEFORE YOU GIVE ME YOUR WORD SAID HE I DON'T WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME IN A HURRY OH CRIED SHE THE LIONS ARE COMING I HAVE LOOKED AT YOU ENOUGH I AM SO FRIGHTENED
319-134959-0061 SAVE ME THIS MINUTE OR I SHALL DIE OF TERROR INDEED AS SHE SPOKE SHE FELL DOWN INSENSIBLE
319-134959-0062 HOW SHE GOT THERE SHE COULD NOT TELL BUT SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LACE AND RIBBONS AND ON HER FINGER WAS A LITTLE RING MADE OF A SINGLE RED HAIR
319-134959-0063 WHEN THE PRINCESS SAW ALL THESE THINGS AND REMEMBERED WHAT HAD HAPPENED SHE TOO FELL INTO THE DEEPEST SADNESS
319-134959-0064 AND THE QUEEN MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE A HUNDRED TIMES SHE ASKED BELLISSIMA IF ANYTHING WAS THE MATTER WITH HER
319-134959-0065 AT LAST THE CHIEF MEN OF THE KINGDOM ANXIOUS TO SEE THEIR PRINCESS MARRIED SENT TO THE QUEEN TO BEG HER TO CHOOSE A HUSBAND FOR HER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SHE REPLIED THAT NOTHING WOULD PLEASE HER BETTER
319-134959-0066 BUT THAT HER DAUGHTER SEEMED SO UNWILLING TO MARRY AND SHE RECOMMENDED THEM TO GO AND TALK TO THE PRINCESS ABOUT IT THEMSELVES SO THIS THEY AT ONCE DID NOW BELLISSIMA WAS MUCH LESS PROUD SINCE HER ADVENTURE WITH THE YELLOW DWARF
319-134959-0067 AND SHE COULD NOT THINK OF A BETTER WAY OF GETTING RID OF THE LITTLE MONSTER THAN TO MARRY SOME POWERFUL KING THEREFORE SHE REPLIED TO THEIR REQUEST MUCH MORE FAVORABLY THAN THEY HAD HOPED SAYING THAT THOUGH SHE WAS VERY HAPPY AS SHE WAS
319-134959-0068 BUT HAD NOT THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD EVER CARE ABOUT HIM AT ALL YOU CAN EASILY IMAGINE HOW DELIGHTED HE WAS WHEN HE HEARD THE NEWS AND HOW ANGRY IT MADE ALL THE OTHER KINGS TO LOSE FOR EVER THE HOPE OF MARRYING THE PRINCESS BUT AFTER ALL
319-134959-0069 BELLISSIMA COULD NOT HAVE MARRIED TWENTY KINGS INDEED SHE HAD FOUND IT QUITE DIFFICULT ENOUGH TO CHOOSE ONE FOR HER VANITY MADE HER BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS NOBODY IN THE WORLD WHO WAS WORTHY OF HER
319-134959-0070 PREPARATIONS WERE BEGUN AT ONCE FOR THE GRANDEST WEDDING THAT HAD EVER BEEN HELD AT THE PALACE THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES SENT SUCH IMMENSE SUMS OF MONEY
319-134959-0071 MESSENGERS WERE SENT TO ALL THE GAYEST AND MOST REFINED COURTS
319-134959-0072 TO SEEK OUT EVERYTHING RARE AND PRECIOUS TO ADORN THE PRINCESS ALTHOUGH HER BEAUTY WAS SO PERFECT THAT NOTHING SHE WORE COULD MAKE HER LOOK PRETTIER AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES THOUGHT AND HE WAS NEVER HAPPY UNLESS HE WAS WITH HER
319-134959-0073 AS FOR THE PRINCESS THE MORE SHE SAW OF THE KING THE MORE SHE LIKED HIM HE WAS SO GENEROUS SO HANDSOME AND CLEVER THAT AT LAST SHE WAS ALMOST AS MUCH IN LOVE WITH HIM AS HE WAS WITH HER
319-134959-0074 THIS IS ONE THAT SHE LIKED VERY MUCH
319-134959-0075 HOPING SHE MAY TREAD ON THEM
319-134959-0076 AS THROUGH THIS ENCHANTED LAND
319-134959-0077 ALL THE KING'S UNSUCCESSFUL RIVALS HAD GONE HOME IN DESPAIR THEY SAID GOOD BY TO THE PRINCESS SO SADLY THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING SORRY FOR THEM AH MADAM THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES SAID TO HER
319-134959-0078 HOW IS THIS WHY DO YOU WASTE YOUR PITY ON THESE PRINCES WHO LOVE YOU SO MUCH THAT ALL THEIR TROUBLE WOULD BE WELL REPAID BY A SINGLE SMILE FROM YOU I SHOULD BE SORRY ANSWERED BELLISSIMA
319-134959-0079 IF YOU HAD NOT NOTICED HOW MUCH I PITIED THESE PRINCES WHO WERE LEAVING ME FOR EVER BUT FOR YOU SIRE IT IS VERY DIFFERENT YOU HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE PLEASED WITH ME
319-134959-0080 SO YOU MUST NOT GRUDGE THEM MY COMPASSION THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES WAS QUITE OVERCOME BY THE PRINCESS'S GOOD NATURED WAY OF TAKING HIS INTERFERENCE AND THROWING HIMSELF AT HER FEET HE KISSED HER HAND A THOUSAND TIMES
319-134959-0081 AND BEGGED HER TO FORGIVE HIM AT LAST THE HAPPY DAY CAME EVERYTHING WAS READY FOR BELLISSIMA'S WEDDING THE TRUMPETS SOUNDED
319-134959-0082 THE QUEEN WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT SHE HAD HARDLY BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP AT ALL AND SHE GOT UP BEFORE IT WAS LIGHT TO GIVE THE NECESSARY ORDERS AND TO CHOOSE THE JEWELS THAT THE PRINCESS WAS TO WEAR THESE WERE NOTHING LESS THAN DIAMONDS
319-134959-0083 EVEN TO HER SHOES WHICH WERE COVERED WITH THEM AND HER DRESS OF SILVER BROCADE WAS EMBROIDERED WITH A DOZEN OF THE SUN'S RAYS YOU MAY IMAGINE HOW MUCH THESE HAD COST
319-134959-0084 EXCEPT THE BEAUTY OF THE PRINCESS UPON HER HEAD SHE WORE A SPLENDID CROWN HER LOVELY HAIR WAVED NEARLY TO HER FEET AND HER STATELY FIGURE COULD EASILY BE DISTINGUISHED AMONG ALL THE LADIES WHO ATTENDED HER
319-134959-0085 THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES WAS NOT LESS NOBLE AND SPLENDID IT WAS EASY TO SEE BY HIS FACE HOW HAPPY HE WAS AND EVERYONE WHO WENT NEAR HIM RETURNED LOADED WITH PRESENTS
319-134959-0086 FOR ALL ROUND THE GREAT BANQUETING HALL HAD BEEN ARRANGED A THOUSAND BARRELS FULL OF GOLD AND NUMBERLESS BAGS MADE OF VELVET EMBROIDERED WITH PEARLS AND FILLED WITH MONEY EACH ONE CONTAINING AT LEAST A HUNDRED THOUSAND GOLD PIECES
319-134959-0087 WHICH WERE GIVEN AWAY TO EVERYONE WHO LIKED TO HOLD OUT HIS HAND WHICH NUMBERS OF PEOPLE HASTENED TO DO YOU MAY BE SURE INDEED SOME FOUND THIS BY FAR THE MOST AMUSING PART OF THE WEDDING FESTIVITIES
319-134959-0088 THE QUEEN AND THE PRINCESS WERE JUST READY TO SET OUT WITH THE KING WHEN THEY SAW ADVANCING TOWARD THEM FROM THE END OF THE LONG GALLERY TWO GREAT BASILISKS DRAGGING AFTER THEM A VERY BADLY MADE BOX
319-134959-0089 BEHIND THEM CAME A TALL OLD WOMAN WHOSE UGLINESS WAS EVEN MORE SURPRISING THAN HER EXTREME OLD AGE SHE WORE A RUFF OF BLACK TAFFETA A RED VELVET HOOD AND A FARTHINGALE ALL IN RAGS
319-134959-0090 AND SHE LEANED HEAVILY UPON A CRUTCH THIS STRANGE OLD WOMAN WITHOUT SAYING A SINGLE WORD HOBBLED THREE TIMES ROUND THE GALLERY FOLLOWED BY THE BASILISKS THEN STOPPING IN THE MIDDLE
319-134959-0091 AND BRANDISHING HER CRUTCH THREATENINGLY SHE CRIED
319-134959-0092 HO HO PRINCESS DO YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING TO BREAK WITH IMPUNITY THE PROMISE THAT YOU MADE TO MY FRIEND THE YELLOW DWARF I AM THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT
319-134959-0093 WITHOUT THE YELLOW DWARF AND HIS ORANGE TREE
319-134959-0094 AND IN FAIRYLAND WE DO NOT SUFFER OURSELVES TO BE INSULTED LIKE THIS MAKE UP YOUR MINDS AT ONCE WHAT YOU WILL DO FOR I VOW THAT YOU SHALL MARRY THE YELLOW DWARF IF YOU DON'T
319-134959-0095 MAY I BURN MY CRUTCH AH PRINCESS SAID THE QUEEN WEEPING WHAT IS THIS THAT I HEAR WHAT HAVE YOU PROMISED AH MY MOTHER REPLIED BELLISSIMA SADLY
319-134959-0096 WHAT DID YOU PROMISE YOURSELF THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES INDIGNANT AT BEING KEPT FROM HIS HAPPINESS BY THIS WICKED OLD WOMAN WENT UP TO HER AND THREATENING HER WITH HIS SWORD SAID GET AWAY OUT OF MY COUNTRY AT ONCE
319-134959-0097 AND FOR EVER MISERABLE CREATURE LEST I TAKE YOUR LIFE AND SO RID MYSELF OF YOUR MALICE HE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN THESE WORDS WHEN THE LID OF THE BOX FELL BACK ON THE FLOOR WITH A TERRIBLE NOISE
319-134959-0098 RASH YOUTH HE CRIED RUSHING BETWEEN THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT AND THE KING DARE TO LAY A FINGER UPON THIS ILLUSTRIOUS FAIRY YOUR QUARREL IS WITH ME ONLY I AM YOUR ENEMY AND YOUR RIVAL
319-134959-0099 THAT FAITHLESS PRINCESS WHO WOULD HAVE MARRIED YOU IS PROMISED TO ME SEE IF SHE HAS NOT UPON HER FINGER A RING MADE OF ONE OF MY HAIRS JUST TRY TO TAKE IT OFF
319-134959-0100 AND YOU WILL SOON FIND OUT THAT I AM MORE POWERFUL THAN YOU ARE WRETCHED LITTLE MONSTER SAID THE KING DO YOU DARE TO CALL YOURSELF THE PRINCESS'S LOVER AND TO LAY CLAIM TO SUCH A TREASURE
319-134959-0101 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE A DWARF THAT YOU ARE SO UGLY THAT ONE CANNOT BEAR TO LOOK AT YOU AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE KILLED YOU MYSELF LONG BEFORE THIS IF YOU HAD BEEN WORTHY OF SUCH A GLORIOUS DEATH
319-134959-0102 THE YELLOW DWARF DEEPLY ENRAGED AT THESE WORDS SET SPURS TO HIS CAT WHICH YELLED HORRIBLY AND LEAPED HITHER AND THITHER TERRIFYING EVERYBODY EXCEPT THE BRAVE KING WHO PURSUED THE DWARF CLOSELY TILL HE
319-134959-0103 DRAWING A GREAT KNIFE WITH WHICH HE WAS ARMED CHALLENGED THE KING TO MEET HIM IN SINGLE COMBAT AND RUSHED DOWN INTO THE COURTYARD OF THE PALACE WITH A TERRIBLE CLATTER THE KING QUITE PROVOKED FOLLOWED HIM HASTILY
319-134959-0104 BUT THEY HAD HARDLY TAKEN THEIR PLACES FACING ONE ANOTHER AND THE WHOLE COURT HAD ONLY JUST HAD TIME TO RUSH OUT UPON THE BALCONIES TO WATCH WHAT WAS GOING ON
319-134959-0105 AND IT WAS SO DARK THAT THEY COULD SCARCELY SEE AT ALL THE THUNDER CRASHED AND THE LIGHTNING SEEMED AS IF IT MUST BURN UP EVERYTHING THE TWO BASILISKS APPEARED
319-134959-0106 LIKE GIANTS MOUNTAINS HIGH AND FIRE FLEW FROM THEIR MOUTHS AND EARS UNTIL THEY LOOKED LIKE FLAMING FURNACES NONE OF THESE THINGS COULD TERRIFY THE NOBLE YOUNG KING AND THE BOLDNESS OF HIS LOOKS AND ACTIONS REASSURED THOSE WHO WERE LOOKING ON
319-134959-0107 AND PERHAPS EVEN EMBARRASSED THE YELLOW DWARF HIMSELF BUT EVEN HIS COURAGE GAVE WAY WHEN HE SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HIS BELOVED PRINCESS FOR THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT LOOKING MORE TERRIBLE THAN BEFORE MOUNTED UPON A WINGED GRIFFIN
319-134959-0108 AND WITH LONG SNAKES COILED ROUND HER NECK HAD GIVEN HER SUCH A BLOW WITH THE LANCE SHE CARRIED THAT BELLISSIMA FELL INTO THE QUEEN'S ARMS BLEEDING AND SENSELESS HER FOND MOTHER FEELING AS MUCH HURT BY THE BLOW AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF
319-134959-0109 UTTERED SUCH PIERCING CRIES AND LAMENTATIONS THAT THE KING HEARING THEM ENTIRELY LOST HIS COURAGE AND PRESENCE OF MIND GIVING UP THE COMBAT HE FLEW TOWARD THE PRINCESS
319-134959-0110 BUT THE YELLOW DWARF WAS TOO QUICK FOR HIM LEAPING WITH HIS SPANISH CAT UPON THE BALCONY HE SNATCHED BELLISSIMA FROM THE QUEEN'S ARMS AND BEFORE ANY OF THE LADIES OF THE COURT COULD STOP HIM HE HAD SPRUNG UPON THE ROOF OF THE PALACE AND DISAPPEARED WITH HIS PRIZE
319-134959-0111 THE KING MOTIONLESS WITH HORROR LOOKED ON DESPAIRINGLY AT THIS DREADFUL OCCURRENCE WHICH HE WAS QUITE POWERLESS TO PREVENT AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE HIS SIGHT FAILED HIM
319-134959-0112 EVERYTHING BECAME DARK AND HE FELT HIMSELF CARRIED ALONG THROUGH THE AIR BY A STRONG HAND THIS NEW MISFORTUNE WAS THE WORK OF THE WICKED FAIRY OF THE DESERT WHO HAD COME WITH THE YELLOW DWARF TO HELP HIM CARRY OFF THE PRINCESS
319-134959-0113 SHE THOUGHT THAT IF SHE CARRIED HIM OFF TO SOME FRIGHTFUL CAVERN AND CHAINED HIM TO A ROCK THEN THE FEAR OF DEATH WOULD MAKE HIM FORGET BELLISSIMA AND BECOME HER SLAVE SO AS SOON AS THEY REACHED THE PLACE
319-134959-0114 SHE GAVE HIM BACK HIS SIGHT BUT WITHOUT RELEASING HIM FROM HIS CHAINS AND BY HER MAGIC POWER SHE APPEARED BEFORE HIM AS A YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL FAIRY AND PRETENDED TO HAVE COME THERE QUITE BY CHANCE WHAT DO I SEE SHE CRIED
319-134959-0115 IS IT YOU DEAR PRINCE WHAT MISFORTUNE HAS BROUGHT YOU TO THIS DISMAL PLACE THE KING WHO WAS QUITE DECEIVED BY HER ALTERED APPEARANCE REPLIED ALAS BEAUTIFUL FAIRY THE FAIRY WHO BROUGHT ME HERE FIRST TOOK AWAY MY SIGHT
319-134959-0116 BUT BY HER VOICE I RECOGNIZED HER AS THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT THOUGH WHAT SHE SHOULD HAVE CARRIED ME OFF FOR I CANNOT TELL YOU AH CRIED THE PRETENDED FAIRY IF YOU HAVE FALLEN INTO HER HANDS YOU WON'T GET AWAY UNTIL YOU HAVE MARRIED HER
319-134959-0117 AND KNEW IN A MOMENT THAT THIS MUST BE THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT FOR HER FEET WERE THE ONE THING SHE COULD NOT CHANGE HOWEVER PRETTY SHE MIGHT MAKE HER FACE WITHOUT SEEMING TO HAVE NOTICED ANYTHING HE SAID IN A CONFIDENTIAL WAY
319-134959-0118 BUT I REALLY CANNOT ENDURE THE WAY IN WHICH SHE PROTECTS THE YELLOW DWARF AND KEEPS ME CHAINED HERE LIKE A CRIMINAL IT IS TRUE THAT I LOVE A CHARMING PRINCESS BUT IF THE FAIRY SHOULD SET ME FREE MY GRATITUDE WOULD OBLIGE ME TO LOVE HER ONLY
319-134959-0119 DO YOU REALLY MEAN WHAT YOU SAY PRINCE SAID THE FAIRY QUITE DECEIVED SURELY REPLIED THE PRINCE HOW COULD I DECEIVE YOU YOU SEE IT IS SO MUCH MORE FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BE LOVED BY A FAIRY THAN BY A SIMPLE PRINCESS
319-134959-0120 I SHALL PRETEND TO HATE HER UNTIL I AM SET FREE THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT QUITE TAKEN IN BY THESE WORDS RESOLVED AT ONCE TO TRANSPORT THE PRINCE TO A PLEASANTER PLACE
319-134959-0121 SO MAKING HIM MOUNT HER CHARIOT TO WHICH SHE HAD HARNESSED SWANS INSTEAD OF THE BATS WHICH GENERALLY DREW IT AWAY SHE FLEW WITH HIM BUT IMAGINE THE DISTRESS OF THE PRINCE WHEN FROM THE GIDDY HEIGHT AT WHICH THEY WERE RUSHING THROUGH THE AIR
319-134959-0122 HE SAW HIS BELOVED PRINCESS IN A CASTLE BUILT OF POLISHED STEEL THE WALLS OF WHICH REFLECTED THE SUN'S RAYS SO HOTLY THAT NO ONE COULD APPROACH IT WITHOUT BEING BURNT TO A CINDER
319-134959-0123 BUT JUST AS THEY PASSED SHE LOOKED UP AND SAW THE KING AND THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT NOW THE FAIRY WAS SO CLEVER THAT SHE COULD NOT ONLY SEEM BEAUTIFUL TO THE KING BUT EVEN THE POOR PRINCESS THOUGHT HER THE MOST LOVELY BEING SHE HAD EVER SEEN
319-134959-0124 WHAT SHE CRIED WAS I NOT UNHAPPY ENOUGH IN THIS LONELY CASTLE TO WHICH THAT FRIGHTFUL YELLOW DWARF BROUGHT ME MUST I ALSO BE MADE TO KNOW THAT THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES CEASED TO LOVE ME
319-134959-0125 AS SOON AS HE LOST SIGHT OF ME BUT WHO CAN MY RIVAL BE WHOSE FATAL BEAUTY IS GREATER THAN MINE WHILE SHE WAS SAYING THIS THE KING WHO REALLY LOVED HER AS MUCH AS EVER
319-134959-0126 WAS FEELING TERRIBLY SAD AT BEING SO RAPIDLY TORN AWAY FROM HIS BELOVED PRINCESS BUT HE KNEW TOO WELL HOW POWERFUL THE FAIRY WAS TO HAVE ANY HOPE OF ESCAPING FROM HER EXCEPT BY GREAT PATIENCE AND CUNNING
319-134959-0127 THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT HAD ALSO SEEN BELLISSIMA AND SHE TRIED TO READ IN THE KING'S EYES THE EFFECT THAT THIS UNEXPECTED SIGHT HAD HAD UPON HIM NO ONE CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOU WISH TO KNOW BETTER THAN I CAN SAID HE
319-134959-0128 THIS CHANCE MEETING WITH AN UNHAPPY PRINCESS FOR WHOM I ONCE HAD A PASSING FANCY BEFORE I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO MEET YOU HAS AFFECTED ME A LITTLE I ADMIT BUT YOU ARE SO MUCH MORE TO ME THAN SHE IS THAT I WOULD RATHER DIE THAN LEAVE YOU
319-134959-0129 AH PRINCE SHE SAID CAN I BELIEVE THAT YOU REALLY LOVE ME SO MUCH TIME WILL SHOW MADAM REPLIED THE KING BUT IF YOU WISH TO CONVINCE ME THAT YOU HAVE SOME REGARD FOR ME DO NOT I BEG OF YOU
319-134959-0130 REFUSE TO AID BELLISSIMA DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ASKING SAID THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT FROWNING AND LOOKING AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY DO YOU WANT ME TO EMPLOY MY ART AGAINST THE YELLOW DWARF WHO IS MY BEST FRIEND
319-134959-0131 AND TAKE AWAY FROM HIM A PROUD PRINCESS
319-134959-0132 THE KING SIGHED BUT MADE NO ANSWER INDEED WHAT WAS THERE TO BE SAID TO SUCH A CLEAR SIGHTED PERSON AT LAST THEY REACHED A VAST MEADOW GAY WITH ALL SORTS OF FLOWERS A DEEP RIVER SURROUNDED IT
319-134959-0133 AND MANY LITTLE BROOKS MURMURED SOFTLY UNDER THE SHADY TREES WHERE IT WAS ALWAYS COOL AND FRESH A LITTLE WAY OFF STOOD A SPLENDID PALACE THE WALLS OF WHICH WERE OF TRANSPARENT EMERALDS
319-134959-0134 AS SOON AS THE SWANS WHICH DREW THE FAIRY'S CHARIOT HAD ALIGHTED UNDER A PORCH WHICH WAS PAVED WITH DIAMONDS AND HAD ARCHES OF RUBIES THEY WERE GREETED ON ALL SIDES BY THOUSANDS OF BEAUTIFUL BEINGS
319-134959-0135 WHO CAME TO MEET THEM JOYFULLY SINGING THESE WORDS WHEN LOVE WITHIN A HEART WOULD REIGN USELESS TO STRIVE AGAINST HIM TIS THE PROUD BUT FEEL A SHARPER PAIN
319-134959-0136 AND MAKE A GREATER TRIUMPH HIS THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR THEM SING OF HER TRIUMPHS SHE LED THE KING INTO THE MOST SPLENDID ROOM THAT CAN BE IMAGINED AND LEFT HIM ALONE FOR A LITTLE WHILE
319-134959-0137 JUST THAT HE MIGHT NOT FEEL THAT HE WAS A PRISONER BUT HE FELT SURE THAT SHE HAD NOT REALLY GONE QUITE AWAY BUT WAS WATCHING HIM FROM SOME HIDING PLACE SO WALKING UP TO A GREAT MIRROR HE SAID TO IT
319-134959-0138 TRUSTY COUNSELLOR LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN DO TO MAKE MYSELF AGREEABLE TO THE CHARMING FAIRY OF THE DESERT FOR I CAN THINK OF NOTHING BUT HOW TO PLEASE HER AND HE AT ONCE SET TO WORK TO CURL HIS HAIR
319-134959-0139 AND SEEING UPON A TABLE A GRANDER COAT THAN HIS OWN HE PUT IT ON CAREFULLY THE FAIRY CAME BACK SO DELIGHTED THAT SHE COULD NOT CONCEAL HER JOY I AM QUITE AWARE OF THE TROUBLE YOU HAVE TAKEN TO PLEASE ME SAID SHE
319-134959-0140 AND I MUST TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED PERFECTLY ALREADY YOU SEE IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO DO IF YOU REALLY CARE FOR ME
319-134959-0141 DID NOT SPARE PRETTY SPEECHES AND AFTER A TIME HE WAS ALLOWED TO WALK BY HIMSELF UPON THE SEA SHORE THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT HAD BY HER ENCHANTMENTS RAISED SUCH A TERRIBLE STORM THAT THE BOLDEST PILOT WOULD NOT VENTURE OUT IN IT
319-134959-0142 SO SHE WAS NOT AFRAID OF HER PRISONER'S BEING ABLE TO ESCAPE
319-134959-0143 WITHOUT BEING INTERRUPTED BY HIS CRUEL CAPTOR PRESENTLY AFTER WALKING WILDLY UP AND DOWN HE WROTE THESE VERSES UPON THE SAND WITH HIS STICK AT LAST MAY I UPON THIS SHORE
319-134959-0144 LIGHTEN MY SORROW WITH SOFT TEARS ALAS ALAS I SEE NO MORE MY LOVE WHO YET MY SADNESS CHEERS AND THOU O RAGING STORMY SEA
