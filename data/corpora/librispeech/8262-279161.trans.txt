8262-279161-0000 AT THE END OF OUR JOURNEY IT IS TIME TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION FROM WHICH WE SET OUT NAMELY WHAT IS IT THAT CHARACTERIZES MIND AS OPPOSED TO MATTER OR TO STATE THE SAME QUESTION IN OTHER TERMS HOW IS PSYCHOLOGY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM PHYSICS
8262-279161-0001 THE ANSWER PROVISIONALLY SUGGESTED AT THE OUTSET OF OUR INQUIRY WAS THAT PSYCHOLOGY AND PHYSICS ARE DISTINGUISHED BY THE NATURE OF THEIR CAUSAL LAWS NOT BY THEIR SUBJECT MATTER AT THE SAME TIME WE HELD THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN SUBJECT MATTER
8262-279161-0002 THIS SUBJECT MATTER THEREFORE WE ASSIGNED EXCLUSIVELY TO PSYCHOLOGY BUT WE FOUND NO WAY OF DEFINING IMAGES EXCEPT THROUGH THEIR CAUSATION
8262-279161-0003 IN THEIR INTRINSIC CHARACTER THEY APPEARED TO HAVE NO UNIVERSAL MARK BY WHICH THEY COULD BE DISTINGUISHED FROM SENSATIONS IN THIS LAST LECTURE I PROPOSE TO PASS IN REVIEW VARIOUS SUGGESTED METHODS OF DISTINGUISHING MIND FROM MATTER
8262-279161-0004 I SHALL THEN BRIEFLY SKETCH THE NATURE OF THAT FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE THE TRUE METAPHYSIC IN WHICH MIND AND MATTER ALIKE ARE SEEN TO BE CONSTRUCTED OUT OF A NEUTRAL STUFF WHOSE CAUSAL LAWS HAVE NO SUCH DUALITY AS THAT OF PSYCHOLOGY
8262-279161-0005 BUT FORM THE BASIS UPON WHICH BOTH PHYSICS AND PSYCHOLOGY ARE BUILT IN SEARCH FOR THE DEFINITION OF MENTAL PHENOMENA LET US BEGIN WITH CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH IS OFTEN THOUGHT TO BE THE ESSENCE OF MIND
8262-279161-0006 IN THE FIRST LECTURE I GAVE VARIOUS ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE VIEW THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS FUNDAMENTAL BUT I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO SAY WHAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS WE MUST FIND A DEFINITION OF IT IF WE ARE TO FEEL SECURE IN DECIDING THAT IT IS NOT FUNDAMENTAL
8262-279161-0007 IT IS FOR THE SAKE OF THE PROOF THAT IT IS NOT FUNDAMENTAL THAT WE MUST NOW ENDEAVOUR TO DECIDE WHAT IT IS CONSCIOUSNESS BY THOSE WHO REGARD IT AS FUNDAMENTAL
8262-279161-0008 SENSATION IN THE STRICT SENSE OF THE TERM DEMANDS THE EXISTENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS
8262-279161-0009 THIS STATEMENT AT FIRST SIGHT IS ONE TO WHICH WE FEEL INCLINED TO ASSENT BUT I BELIEVE WE ARE MISTAKEN IF WE DO SO
8262-279161-0010 BUT NOT A THING OF WHICH WE MUST BE CONSCIOUS WE HAVE BEEN LED IN THE COURSE OF OUR INQUIRY
8262-279161-0011 I THINK IT MAY BE SAID THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE IMAGE CONSTITUTES CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE SENSATION PROVIDED IT IS ACCOMPANIED BY THAT SORT OF BELIEF WHICH WHEN WE REFLECT UPON IT MAKES US FEEL THAT THE IMAGE IS A SIGN OF SOMETHING OTHER THAN ITSELF
8262-279161-0012 THIS IS THE SORT OF BELIEF WHICH IN THE CASE OF MEMORY WE EXPRESSED IN THE WORDS THIS OCCURRED OR WHICH IN THE CASE OF A JUDGMENT OF PERCEPTION MAKES US BELIEVE IN QUALITIES CORRELATED WITH PRESENT SENSATIONS AS
8262-279161-0013 THE ADDITION OF SOME ELEMENT OF BELIEF SEEMS REQUIRED SINCE MERE IMAGINATION DOES NOT INVOLVE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ANYTHING AND THERE CAN BE NO CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH IS NOT OF SOMETHING IF IMAGES ALONE CONSTITUTED CONSCIOUSNESS OF THEIR PROTOTYPES
8262-279161-0014 SUCH IMAGINATION IMAGES AS IN FACT HAVE PROTOTYPES WOULD INVOLVE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THEM SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AN ELEMENT OF BELIEF MUST BE ADDED TO THE IMAGES IN DEFINING CONSCIOUSNESS
8262-279161-0015 THE BELIEF MUST BE OF THAT SORT THAT CONSTITUTES OBJECTIVE REFERENCE PAST OR PRESENT AN IMAGE TOGETHER WITH A BELIEF OF THIS SORT CONCERNING IT CONSTITUTES ACCORDING TO OUR DEFINITION CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE PROTOTYPE OF THE IMAGE
8262-279161-0016 BUT WHEN WE PASS FROM CONSCIOUSNESS OF SENSATIONS TO CONSCIOUSNESS OF OBJECTS OF PERCEPTION CERTAIN FURTHER POINTS ARISE WHICH DEMAND AN ADDITION TO OUR DEFINITION A JUDGMENT OF PERCEPTION WE MAY SAY
8262-279161-0017 CONSISTS OF A CORE OF SENSATION TOGETHER WITH ASSOCIATED IMAGES WITH BELIEF IN THE PRESENT EXISTENCE OF AN OBJECT TO WHICH SENSATION AND IMAGES ARE REFERRED IN A WAY WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO ANALYSE PERHAPS WE MIGHT SAY
8262-279161-0018 THAT THE BELIEF IS NOT FUNDAMENTALLY IN ANY PRESENT EXISTENCE BUT IS OF THE NATURE OF AN EXPECTATION FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE SEE AN OBJECT WE EXPECT CERTAIN SENSATIONS TO RESULT IF WE PROCEED TO TOUCH IT
8262-279161-0019 PERCEPTION THEN WILL CONSIST OF A PRESENT SENSATION TOGETHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE SENSATIONS THIS OF COURSE IS A REFLECTIVE ANALYSIS NOT AN ACCOUNT OF THE WAY PERCEPTION APPEARS TO UNCHECKED INTROSPECTION
8262-279161-0020 BUT NOT INVARIABLE ANY SUCH CORRELATION MAY MISLEAD US IN A PARTICULAR CASE FOR EXAMPLE IF WE TRY TO TOUCH A REFLECTION IN A LOOKING GLASS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IT IS REAL
8262-279161-0021 SINCE MEMORY IS FALLIBLE A SIMILAR DIFFICULTY ARISES AS REGARDS CONSCIOUSNESS OF PAST OBJECTS IT WOULD SEEM ODD TO SAY THAT WE CAN BE CONSCIOUS OF A THING WHICH DOES NOT OR DID NOT EXIST
8262-279161-0022 THE ONLY WAY TO AVOID THIS AWKWARDNESS IS TO ADD TO OUR DEFINITION THE PROVISO THAT THE BELIEFS INVOLVED IN CONSCIOUSNESS MUST BE TRUE IN THE SECOND PLACE THE QUESTION ARISES AS TO WHETHER WE CAN BE CONSCIOUS OF IMAGES
8262-279161-0023 IF WE APPLY OUR DEFINITION TO THIS CASE IT SEEMS TO DEMAND IMAGES OF IMAGES IN ORDER FOR EXAMPLE TO BE CONSCIOUS OF AN IMAGE OF A CAT WE SHALL REQUIRE ACCORDING TO THE LETTER OF THE DEFINITION
8262-279161-0024 AN IMAGE WHICH IS A COPY OF OUR IMAGE OF THE CAT AND HAS THIS IMAGE FOR ITS PROTOTYPE NOW IT HARDLY SEEMS PROBABLE AS A MATTER OF OBSERVATION THAT THERE ARE IMAGES OF IMAGES AS OPPOSED TO IMAGES OF SENSATIONS
8262-279161-0025 WE MAY MEET THIS DIFFICULTY IN TWO WAYS EITHER BY BOLDLY DENYING CONSCIOUSNESS OF IMAGES OR BY FINDING A SENSE IN WHICH BY MEANS OF A DIFFERENT ACCOMPANYING BELIEF AN IMAGE INSTEAD OF MEANING ITS PROTOTYPE
8262-279161-0026 BUT IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN EXCEPT BY ACCIDENT THAT A CAT WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH A MAT AND IN LIKE MANNER AN IMAGE MAY HAVE CERTAIN ASSOCIATIONS WHICH ITS PROTOTYPE WILL NOT HAVE
8262-279161-0027 WHEN THESE ASSOCIATIONS ARE ACTIVE AN IMAGE MEANS AN IMAGE INSTEAD OF MEANING ITS PROTOTYPE IF I HAVE HAD IMAGES OF A GIVEN PROTOTYPE MANY TIMES I CAN MEAN ONE OF THESE AS OPPOSED TO THE REST
8262-279161-0028 BY RECOLLECTING THE TIME AND PLACE OR ANY OTHER DISTINCTIVE ASSOCIATION OF THAT ONE OCCASION THIS HAPPENS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN A PLACE RECALLS TO US SOME THOUGHT WE PREVIOUSLY HAD IN THAT PLACE SO THAT WE REMEMBER A THOUGHT AS OPPOSED TO THE OCCURRENCE TO WHICH IT REFERRED
8262-279161-0029 THUS WE MAY SAY THAT WE THINK OF AN IMAGE A WHEN WE HAVE A SIMILAR IMAGE B ASSOCIATED WITH RECOLLECTIONS OF CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH A BUT NOT WITH ITS PROTOTYPE OR WITH OTHER IMAGES OF THE SAME PROTOTYPE
8262-279161-0030 MERELY BY THE HELP OF NEW ASSOCIATIONS THIS THEORY SO FAR AS I CAN SEE
8262-279161-0031 ACCORDING TO WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SAYING SENSATION ITSELF IS NOT AN INSTANCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS THOUGH THE IMMEDIATE MEMORY BY WHICH IT IS APT TO BE SUCCEEDED IS SO
8262-279161-0032 A SENSATION WHICH IS REMEMBERED BECOMES AN OBJECT OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS SOON AS IT BEGINS TO BE REMEMBERED WHICH WILL NORMALLY BE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER ITS OCCURRENCE IF AT ALL
8262-279161-0033 BUT WHILE IT EXISTS IT IS NOT AN OBJECT OF CONSCIOUSNESS IF HOWEVER IT IS PART OF A PERCEPTION SAY OF SOME FAMILIAR PERSON
8262-279161-0034 FOR IN THIS CASE THE SENSATION IS A SIGN OF THE PERCEIVED OBJECT IN MUCH THE SAME WAY IN WHICH A MEMORY IMAGE IS A SIGN OF A REMEMBERED OBJECT THE ESSENTIAL PRACTICAL FUNCTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND THOUGHT
8262-279161-0035 IS THAT THEY ENABLE US TO ACT WITH REFERENCE TO WHAT IS DISTANT IN TIME OR SPACE EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT AT PRESENT STIMULATING OUR SENSES THIS REFERENCE TO ABSENT OBJECTS IS POSSIBLE THROUGH ASSOCIATION AND HABIT
8262-279161-0036 ACTUAL SENSATIONS IN THEMSELVES ARE NOT CASES OF CONSCIOUSNESS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT BRING IN THIS REFERENCE TO WHAT IS ABSENT BUT THEIR CONNECTION WITH CONSCIOUSNESS IS VERY CLOSE BOTH THROUGH IMMEDIATE MEMORY
8262-279161-0037 AND THROUGH THE CORRELATIONS WHICH TURN SENSATIONS INTO PERCEPTIONS ENOUGH HAS I HOPE BEEN SAID TO SHOW THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS FAR TOO COMPLEX AND ACCIDENTAL TO BE TAKEN AS THE FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTIC OF MIND
8262-279161-0038 SUPPOSE YOU ARE IN A FAMILIAR ROOM AT NIGHT AND SUDDENLY THE LIGHT GOES OUT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND YOUR WAY TO THE DOOR WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY BY MEANS OF THE PICTURE OF THE ROOM WHICH YOU HAVE IN YOUR MIND
8262-279161-0039 IN THIS CASE VISUAL IMAGES SERVE SOMEWHAT IMPERFECTLY IT IS TRUE THE PURPOSE WHICH VISUAL SENSATIONS WOULD OTHERWISE SERVE THE STIMULUS TO THE PRODUCTION OF VISUAL IMAGES IS THE DESIRE TO GET OUT OF THE ROOM WHICH
8262-279161-0040 AGAIN WORDS HEARD OR READ ENABLE YOU TO ACT WITH REFERENCE TO THE MATTERS ABOUT WHICH THEY GIVE INFORMATION HERE AGAIN A PRESENT SENSIBLE STIMULUS
8262-279161-0041 IN VIRTUE OF HABITS FORMED IN THE PAST ENABLES YOU TO ACT IN A MANNER APPROPRIATE TO AN OBJECT WHICH IS NOT SENSIBLY PRESENT THE WHOLE ESSENCE OF THE PRACTICAL EFFICIENCY OF THOUGHT CONSISTS IN SENSITIVENESS TO SIGNS
8262-279161-0042 THE SENSIBLE PRESENCE OF A WHICH IS A SIGN OF THE PRESENT OR FUTURE EXISTENCE OF B ENABLES US TO ACT IN A MANNER APPROPRIATE TO B OF THIS WORDS ARE THE SUPREME EXAMPLE
8262-279161-0043 SINCE THEIR EFFECTS AS SIGNS ARE PRODIGIOUS WHILE THEIR INTRINSIC INTEREST AS SENSIBLE OCCURRENCES ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT IS USUALLY VERY SLIGHT THE OPERATION OF SIGNS MAY OR MAY NOT BE ACCOMPANIED BY CONSCIOUSNESS
8262-279161-0044 IF A SENSIBLE STIMULUS A CALLS UP AN IMAGE OF B AND WE THEN ACT WITH REFERENCE TO B WE HAVE WHAT MAY BE CALLED CONSCIOUSNESS OF B
8262-279161-0045 IT OPERATES WITHOUT THE HELP OF CONSCIOUSNESS BROADLY SPEAKING A VERY FAMILIAR SIGN TENDS TO OPERATE DIRECTLY IN THIS MANNER AND THE INTERVENTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS MARKS AN IMPERFECTLY ESTABLISHED HABIT
8262-279161-0046 THE POWER OF ACQUIRING EXPERIENCE WHICH CHARACTERIZES MEN AND ANIMALS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE GENERAL LAW THAT IN MNEMIC CAUSATION THE CAUSAL UNIT IS NOT ONE EVENT AT ONE TIME
8262-279161-0047 BUT TWO OR MORE EVENTS AT TWO OR MORE TIMES AND A BURNT CHILD FEARS THE FIRE THAT IS TO SAY THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF FIRE HAS A DIFFERENT EFFECT UPON A CHILD WHICH HAS HAD THE SENSATIONS OF BURNING THAN UPON ONE WHICH HAS NOT
8262-279161-0048 MORE CORRECTLY THE OBSERVED EFFECT WHEN A CHILD WHICH HAS BEEN BURNT IS PUT NEAR A FIRE HAS FOR ITS CAUSE NOT MERELY THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE FIRE BUT THIS TOGETHER WITH THE PREVIOUS BURNING THE GENERAL FORMULA
8262-279161-0049 WHEN AN ANIMAL HAS ACQUIRED EXPERIENCE THROUGH SOME EVENT A IS THAT WHEN B OCCURS AT SOME FUTURE TIME THE ANIMAL TO WHICH A HAS HAPPENED ACTS DIFFERENTLY FROM AN ANIMAL WHICH A HAS NOT HAPPENED
8262-279161-0050 THUS A AND B TOGETHER NOT EITHER SEPARATELY MUST BE REGARDED AS THE CAUSE OF THE ANIMAL'S BEHAVIOUR UNLESS WE TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE EFFECT WHICH A HAS HAD IN ALTERING THE ANIMAL'S NERVOUS TISSUE
8262-279161-0051 BUT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE EFFECT WHICH THE PRESENT OCCURRENCE WOULD HAVE PRODUCED IF THE RECOLLECTED EVENT HAD NOT OCCURRED THIS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE PHYSICAL EFFECT OF THE PAST EVENT ON THE BRAIN
8262-279161-0052 MAKING IT A DIFFERENT INSTRUMENT FROM THAT WHICH WOULD HAVE RESULTED FROM A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE
8262-279161-0053 WITH EVERY SPECIAL CLASS OF MENTAL PHENOMENA THIS POSSIBILITY MEETS US AFRESH IF PSYCHOLOGY IS TO BE A SEPARATE SCIENCE AT ALL WE MUST SEEK A WIDER GROUND FOR ITS SEPARATENESS THAN ANY THAT WE HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING HITHERTO
8262-279161-0054 WE HAVE FOUND THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS TOO NARROW TO CHARACTERIZE MENTAL PHENOMENA AND THAT MNEMIC CAUSATION IS TOO WIDE
8262-279161-0055 NAMELY SUBJECTIVITY SUBJECTIVITY AS A CHARACTERISTIC OF MENTAL PHENOMENA
8262-279161-0056 WE THERE DECIDED THAT THOSE PARTICULARS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE PHYSICAL WORLD CAN BE COLLECTED INTO SETS IN TWO WAYS ONE OF WHICH MAKES A BUNDLE OF ALL THOSE PARTICULARS THAT ARE APPEARANCES OF A GIVEN THING FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
8262-279161-0057 WHILE THE OTHER MAKES A BUNDLE OF ALL THOSE PARTICULARS WHICH ARE APPEARANCES OF DIFFERENT THINGS FROM A GIVEN PLACE A BUNDLE OF THIS LATTER SORT AT A GIVEN TIME IS CALLED A PERSPECTIVE TAKEN THROUGHOUT A PERIOD OF TIME
8262-279161-0058 IT IS CALLED A BIOGRAPHY SUBJECTIVITY IS THE CHARACTERISTIC OF PERSPECTIVES AND BIOGRAPHIES THE CHARACTERISTIC OF GIVING THE VIEW OF THE WORLD FROM A CERTAIN PLACE
8262-279161-0059 SUCH AS CONSCIOUSNESS EXPERIENCE AND MEMORY WE FOUND IN FACT THAT IT IS EXHIBITED BY A PHOTOGRAPHIC PLATE AND STRICTLY SPEAKING
8262-279161-0060 THOSE FORMING ONE BIOGRAPHY PRIMARILY BY THE EXISTENCE OF DIRECT TIME RELATIONS BETWEEN THEM TO THESE ARE TO BE ADDED RELATIONS DERIVABLE FROM THE LAWS OF PERSPECTIVE
8262-279161-0061 IN ALL THIS WE ARE CLEARLY NOT IN THE REGION OF PSYCHOLOGY AS COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD YET WE ARE ALSO HARDLY IN THE REGION OF PHYSICS AND THE DEFINITION OF PERSPECTIVES AND BIOGRAPHIES
8262-279161-0062 THOUGH IT DOES NOT YET YIELD ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE COMMONLY CALLED MENTAL IS PRESUPPOSED IN MENTAL PHENOMENA FOR EXAMPLE IN MNEMIC CAUSATION THE CAUSAL UNIT IN MNEMIC CAUSATION WHICH GIVES RISE TO SEMON'S ENGRAM
8262-279161-0063 IS THE WHOLE OF ONE PERSPECTIVE NOT OF ANY PERSPECTIVE BUT OF A PERSPECTIVE IN A PLACE WHERE THERE IS NERVOUS TISSUE OR AT ANY RATE LIVING TISSUE OF SOME SORT PERCEPTION ALSO AS WE SAW
8262-279161-0064 CAN ONLY BE DEFINED IN TERMS OF PERSPECTIVES THUS THE CONCEPTION OF SUBJECTIVITY
8262-279161-0065 IS CLEARLY AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN THE DEFINITION I HAVE MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THESE LECTURES THAT THE DATA OF PSYCHOLOGY DO NOT DIFFER IN THEIR INTRINSIC CHARACTER FROM THE DATA OF PHYSICS
8262-279161-0066 I HAVE MAINTAINED THAT SENSATIONS ARE DATA FOR PSYCHOLOGY AND PHYSICS EQUALLY WHILE IMAGES WHICH MAY BE IN SOME SENSE EXCLUSIVELY PSYCHOLOGICAL DATA CAN ONLY BE DISTINGUISHED FROM SENSATIONS BY THEIR CORRELATIONS
8262-279161-0067 NOT BY WHAT THEY ARE IN THEMSELVES IT IS NOW NECESSARY HOWEVER TO EXAMINE THE NOTION OF A DATUM AND TO OBTAIN IF POSSIBLE A DEFINITION OF THIS NOTION THE NOTION OF DATA IS FAMILIAR THROUGHOUT SCIENCE
8262-279161-0068 AND IS USUALLY TREATED BY MEN OF SCIENCE AS THOUGH IT WERE PERFECTLY CLEAR PSYCHOLOGISTS ON THE OTHER HAND FIND GREAT DIFFICULTY IN THE CONCEPTION DATA ARE NATURALLY DEFINED IN TERMS OF THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE
8262-279161-0069 THEY ARE THOSE PROPOSITIONS OF WHICH THE TRUTH IS KNOWN WITHOUT DEMONSTRATION SO THAT THEY MAY BE USED AS PREMISSES IN PROVING OTHER PROPOSITIONS FURTHER WHEN A PROPOSITION WHICH IS A DATUM ASSERTS THE EXISTENCE OF SOMETHING
8262-279161-0070 WE SAY THAT THE SOMETHING IS A DATUM
8262-279161-0071 THERE IS SOME DIFFICULTY IN CONNECTING THIS EPISTEMOLOGICAL DEFINITION OF DATA WITH OUR PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE BUT UNTIL SUCH A CONNECTION HAS BEEN EFFECTED WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO USE THE CONCEPTION DATA
8262-279161-0072 IT IS CLEAR IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT THERE CAN BE NO DATUM APART FROM A BELIEF A SENSATION WHICH MERELY COMES AND GOES IS NOT A DATUM IT ONLY BECOMES A DATUM WHEN IT IS REMEMBERED SIMILARLY IN PERCEPTION
8262-279161-0073 WE DO NOT HAVE A DATUM UNLESS WE HAVE A JUDGMENT OF PERCEPTION IN THE SENSE IN WHICH OBJECTS AS OPPOSED TO PROPOSITIONS ARE DATA IT WOULD SEEM NATURAL TO SAY THAT THOSE OBJECTS OF WHICH WE ARE CONSCIOUS ARE DATA
8262-279161-0074 BUT CONSCIOUSNESS AS WE HAVE SEEN IS A COMPLEX NOTION INVOLVING BELIEFS AS WELL AS MNEMIC PHENOMENA SUCH AS ARE REQUIRED FOR PERCEPTION AND MEMORY IT FOLLOWS THAT NO DATUM IS THEORETICALLY INDUBITABLE SINCE NO BELIEF IS INFALLIBLE
8262-279161-0075 SINCE THERE IS ALWAYS SOME VAGUENESS IN MEMORY AND THE MEANING OF IMAGES DATA ARE NOT THOSE THINGS OF WHICH OUR CONSCIOUSNESS IS EARLIEST IN TIME AT EVERY PERIOD OF LIFE
8262-279161-0076 AFTER WE HAVE BECOME CAPABLE OF THOUGHT SOME OF OUR BELIEFS ARE OBTAINED BY INFERENCE WHILE OTHERS ARE NOT A BELIEF MAY PASS FROM EITHER OF THESE CLASSES INTO THE OTHER AND MAY THEREFORE BECOME
8262-279161-0077 WHEN IN WHAT FOLLOWS I SPEAK OF DATA I DO NOT MEAN THE THINGS OF WHICH WE FEEL SURE BEFORE SCIENTIFIC STUDY BEGINS BUT THE THINGS WHICH
8262-279161-0078 I ASSUME THAT IS TO SAY A TRAINED OBSERVER WITH AN ANALYTIC ATTENTION KNOWING THE SORT OF THING TO LOOK FOR AND THE SORT OF THING THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT WHAT HE OBSERVES IS AT THE STAGE OF SCIENCE WHICH HE HAS REACHED
8262-279161-0079 A DATUM FOR HIS SCIENCE IT IS JUST AS SOPHISTICATED AND ELABORATE AS THE THEORIES WHICH HE BASES UPON IT SINCE ONLY TRAINED HABITS AND MUCH PRACTICE ENABLE A MAN TO MAKE THE KIND OF OBSERVATION THAT WILL BE SCIENTIFICALLY ILLUMINATING NEVERTHELESS
8262-279161-0080 WHEN ONCE IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED BELIEF IN IT IS NOT BASED ON INFERENCE AND REASONING BUT MERELY UPON ITS HAVING BEEN SEEN IN THIS WAY ITS LOGICAL STATUS DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE THEORIES WHICH ARE PROVED BY ITS MEANS
8262-279161-0081 BUT IF WE POSTULATE AN IDEAL OBSERVER HE WILL BE ABLE TO ISOLATE THE SENSATION AND TREAT THIS ALONE AS DATUM THERE IS THEREFORE AN IMPORTANT SENSE IN WHICH WE MAY SAY THAT
8262-279161-0082 OUR DATA OUTSIDE PSYCHOLOGY CONSIST OF SENSATIONS WHICH INCLUDE WITHIN THEMSELVES CERTAIN SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RELATIONS APPLYING THIS REMARK TO PHYSIOLOGY
8262-279161-0083 WE SEE THAT THE NERVES AND BRAIN AS PHYSICAL OBJECTS ARE NOT TRULY DATA THEY ARE TO BE REPLACED IN THE IDEAL STRUCTURE OF SCIENCE BY THE SENSATIONS THROUGH WHICH THE PHYSIOLOGIST IS SAID TO PERCEIVE THEM
8262-279161-0084 THE PASSAGE FROM THESE SENSATIONS TO NERVES AND BRAIN AS PHYSICAL OBJECTS BELONGS REALLY TO THE INITIAL STAGE IN THE THEORY OF PHYSICS AND OUGHT TO BE PLACED IN THE REASONED PART NOT IN THE PART SUPPOSED TO BE OBSERVED
8262-279161-0085 TO SAY WE SEE THE NERVES IS LIKE SAYING WE HEAR THE NIGHTINGALE BOTH ARE CONVENIENT BUT INACCURATE EXPRESSIONS WE HEAR A SOUND WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE CAUSALLY CONNECTED WITH THE NIGHTINGALE
8262-279161-0086 BUT IN EACH CASE IT IS ONLY THE SENSATION THAT OUGHT IN STRICTNESS TO BE CALLED A DATUM NOW SENSATIONS ARE CERTAINLY AMONG THE DATA OF PSYCHOLOGY THEREFORE ALL THE DATA OF THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES ARE ALSO PSYCHOLOGICAL DATA
8262-279161-0087 IT REMAINS TO INQUIRE WHETHER ALL THE DATA OF PSYCHOLOGY ARE ALSO DATA OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND ESPECIALLY OF PHYSIOLOGY IF WE HAVE BEEN RIGHT IN OUR ANALYSIS OF MIND
8262-279161-0088 THE ULTIMATE DATA OF PSYCHOLOGY ARE ONLY SENSATIONS AND IMAGES AND THEIR RELATIONS BELIEFS DESIRES VOLITIONS AND SO ON APPEARED TO US TO BE COMPLEX PHENOMENA CONSISTING OF SENSATIONS AND IMAGES VARIOUSLY INTERRELATED
8262-279161-0089 THUS APART FROM CERTAIN RELATIONS THE OCCURRENCES WHICH SEEM MOST DISTINCTIVELY MENTAL AND FURTHEST REMOVED FROM PHYSICS ARE LIKE PHYSICAL OBJECTS
8262-279161-0090 FROM BOTH ENDS THEREFORE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DATA IS DIMINISHED IS THERE ULTIMATELY NO DIFFERENCE OR DO IMAGES REMAIN AS IRREDUCIBLY AND EXCLUSIVELY PSYCHOLOGICAL
8262-279161-0091 THIS BRINGS US TO A NEW QUESTION NAMELY
8262-279161-0092 OR ARE THEY REALLY PHYSIOLOGICAL CERTAIN AMBIGUITIES MUST BE REMOVED BEFORE THIS QUESTION CAN BE ADEQUATELY DISCUSSED
8262-279161-0093 FIRST THERE IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ROUGH APPROXIMATE LAWS AND SUCH AS APPEAR TO BE PRECISE AND GENERAL I SHALL RETURN TO THE FORMER PRESENTLY IT IS THE LATTER THAT I WISH TO DISCUSS NOW
8262-279161-0094 EXCEPT IN CASES OF PERFECT REGULARITY IN APPEARANCES OF WHICH WE CAN HAVE NO EXPERIENCE THE ACTUAL APPEARANCES OF A PIECE OF MATTER ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THAT IDEAL SYSTEM OF REGULAR APPEARANCES WHICH IS DEFINED AS BEING THE MATTER IN QUESTION
8262-279161-0095 BUT THE MATTER IS AFTER ALL INFERRED FROM ITS APPEARANCES WHICH ARE USED TO VERIFY PHYSICAL LAWS THUS IN SO FAR AS PHYSICS IS AN EMPIRICAL AND VERIFIABLE SCIENCE
8262-279161-0096 IT MUST ASSUME OR PROVE THAT THE INFERENCE FROM APPEARANCES TO MATTER IS IN GENERAL LEGITIMATE AND IT MUST BE ABLE TO TELL US MORE OR LESS WHAT APPEARANCES TO EXPECT
8262-279161-0097 IT IS THROUGH THIS QUESTION OF VERIFIABILITY AND EMPIRICAL APPLICABILITY TO EXPERIENCE THAT WE ARE LED TO A THEORY OF MATTER SUCH AS I ADVOCATE FROM THE CONSIDERATION OF THIS QUESTION IT RESULTS THAT PHYSICS
8262-279161-0098 IN SO FAR AS IT IS AN EMPIRICAL SCIENCE NOT A LOGICAL PHANTASY IS CONCERNED WITH PARTICULARS OF JUST THE SAME SORT AS THOSE WHICH PSYCHOLOGY CONSIDERS UNDER THE NAME OF SENSATIONS
8262-279161-0099 DIFFER FROM THOSE OF PSYCHOLOGY ONLY BY THE FACT THAT THEY CONNECT A PARTICULAR WITH OTHER APPEARANCES IN THE SAME PIECE OF MATTER RATHER THAN WITH OTHER APPEARANCES IN THE SAME PERSPECTIVE
8262-279161-0100 THAT IS TO SAY THEY GROUP TOGETHER PARTICULARS HAVING THE SAME ACTIVE PLACE WHILE PSYCHOLOGY GROUPS TOGETHER THOSE HAVING THE SAME PASSIVE PLACE
8262-279161-0101 SOME PARTICULARS SUCH AS IMAGES HAVE NO ACTIVE PLACE AND THEREFORE BELONG EXCLUSIVELY TO PSYCHOLOGY WE CAN NOW UNDERSTAND THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PHYSICS AND PSYCHOLOGY THE NERVES AND BRAIN ARE MATTER
8262-279161-0102 OUR VISUAL SENSATIONS WHEN WE LOOK AT THEM MAY BE AND I THINK ARE MEMBERS OF THE SYSTEM CONSTITUTING IRREGULAR APPEARANCES OF THIS MATTER BUT ARE NOT THE WHOLE OF THE SYSTEM PSYCHOLOGY IS CONCERNED INTER ALIA
8262-279161-0103 WITH OUR SENSATIONS WHEN WE SEE A PIECE OF MATTER AS OPPOSED TO THE MATTER WHICH WE SEE ASSUMING AS WE MUST THAT OUR SENSATIONS HAVE PHYSICAL CAUSES
8262-279161-0104 REQUIRES THE BREAKING UP OF THE GROUP OF WHICH IT IS A MEMBER
8262-279161-0105 BUT WHEN IT IS STUDIED BY PSYCHOLOGY IT IS TAKEN AWAY FROM THAT GROUP AND PUT INTO QUITE A DIFFERENT CONTEXT WHERE IT CAUSES IMAGES OR VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS
8262-279161-0106 A SECONDARY DIFFERENCE IS THAT IMAGES WHICH BELONG TO PSYCHOLOGY
8262-279161-0107 THERE REMAINS HOWEVER AN IMPORTANT QUESTION
8262-279161-0108 BEFORE WE CAN DISCUSS THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WE MUST FIRST BE CLEAR AS TO WHAT OUR QUESTION MEANS WHEN GIVEN A IT IS POSSIBLE TO INFER B BUT GIVEN B IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO INFER A
8262-279161-0109 WE SAY THAT B IS DEPENDENT UPON A IN A SENSE IN WHICH A IS NOT DEPENDENT UPON B STATED IN LOGICAL TERMS THIS AMOUNTS TO SAYING THAT WHEN WE KNOW A MANY ONE RELATION OF A TO B
8262-279161-0110 B IS DEPENDENT UPON A IN RESPECT OF THIS RELATION
8262-279161-0111 THE ILLUSTRATION THAT CHIEFLY CONCERNS US IS THE SYSTEM OF APPEARANCES OF A PHYSICAL OBJECT WE CAN BROADLY SPEAKING INFER DISTANT APPEARANCES FROM NEAR ONES BUT NOT VICE VERSA
8262-279161-0112 ALL MEN LOOK ALIKE WHEN THEY ARE A MILE AWAY HENCE WHEN WE SEE A MAN A MILE OFF WE CANNOT TELL WHAT HE WILL LOOK LIKE WHEN HE IS ONLY A YARD AWAY
8262-279161-0113 WE CAN TELL WHAT HE WILL LOOK LIKE A MILE AWAY THUS THE NEARER VIEW GIVES US MORE VALUABLE INFORMATION
8262-279161-0114 IT IS THIS GREATER CAUSAL POTENCY OF THE NEAR APPEARANCE THAT LEADS PHYSICS TO STATE ITS CAUSAL LAWS IN TERMS OF THAT SYSTEM OF REGULAR APPEARANCES TO WHICH THE NEAREST APPEARANCES INCREASINGLY APPROXIMATE
8262-279161-0115 AND THAT MAKES IT VALUE INFORMATION DERIVED FROM THE MICROSCOPE OR TELESCOPE
8262-279161-0116 THEREFORE IN OUR SENSATIONAL LIFE WE ARE IN CAUSAL DEPENDENCE UPON PHYSICAL LAWS THIS HOWEVER IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT OR INTERESTING PART OF OUR QUESTION IT IS THE CAUSATION OF IMAGES THAT IS THE VITAL PROBLEM
8262-279161-0117 WE HAVE SEEN THAT THEY ARE SUBJECT TO MNENIC CAUSATION AND THAT MNENIC CAUSATION MAY BE REDUCIBLE TO ORDINARY PHYSICAL CAUSATION IN NERVOUS TISSUE THIS IS THE QUESTION UPON WHICH OUR ATTITUDE MUST TURN TOWARDS WHAT MAY BE CALLED MATERIALISM
8262-279161-0118 WHETHER THIS IS THE CASE OR NOT I DO NOT PROFESS TO KNOW THE QUESTION SEEMS TO ME THE SAME AS THE QUESTION WHETHER MNEMIC CAUSATION IS ULTIMATE
8262-279161-0119 IN CONSIDERING THE CAUSAL LAWS OF PSYCHOLOGY THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ROUGH GENERALIZATIONS AND EXACT LAWS IS IMPORTANT THERE ARE MANY ROUGH GENERALIZATIONS IN PSYCHOLOGY NOT ONLY OF THE SORT BY WHICH WE GOVERN OUR ORDINARY BEHAVIOUR TO EACH OTHER
8262-279161-0120 BUT ALSO OF A MORE NEARLY SCIENTIFIC KIND HABIT AND ASSOCIATION BELONG AMONG SUCH LAWS I WILL GIVE AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE KIND OF LAW THAT CAN BE OBTAINED
8262-279161-0121 SUPPOSE A PERSON HAS FREQUENTLY EXPERIENCED A AND B IN CLOSE TEMPORAL CONTIGUITY AN ASSOCIATION WILL BE ESTABLISHED SO THAT A OR AN IMAGE OF A TENDS TO CAUSE AN IMAGE OF B THE QUESTION ARISES
8262-279161-0122 WILL THE ASSOCIATION WORK IN EITHER DIRECTION OR ONLY FROM THE ONE WHICH HAS OCCURRED EARLIER TO THE ONE WHICH HAS OCCURRED LATER IN AN ARTICLE BY MISTER WOHLGEMUTH CALLED THE DIRECTION OF ASSOCIATIONS
8262-279161-0123 IT IS CLAIMED TO BE PROVED BY EXPERIMENT THAT IN SO FAR AS MOTOR MEMORY
8262-279161-0124 ASSOCIATION WORKS ONLY FROM EARLIER TO LATER WHILE IN VISUAL AND AUDITORY MEMORY THIS IS NOT THE CASE BUT THE LATER OF TWO NEIGHBOURING EXPERIENCES MAY RECALL THE EARLIER AS WELL AS THE EARLIER THE LATER
8262-279161-0125 IT IS SUGGESTED THAT MOTOR MEMORY IS PHYSIOLOGICAL WHILE VISUAL AND AUDITORY MEMORY ARE MORE TRULY PSYCHOLOGICAL BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT WHICH CONCERNS US IN THE ILLUSTRATION THE POINT WHICH CONCERNS US IS THAT A LAW OF ASSOCIATION
8262-279161-0126 ESTABLISHED BY PURELY PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION IS A PURELY PSYCHOLOGICAL LAW AND MAY SERVE AS A SAMPLE OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE IN THE WAY OF DISCOVERING SUCH LAWS IT IS HOWEVER
8262-279161-0127 STILL NO MORE THAN A ROUGH GENERALIZATION A STATISTICAL AVERAGE IT CANNOT TELL US WHAT WILL RESULT FROM A GIVEN CAUSE ON A GIVEN OCCASION IT IS A LAW OF TENDENCY
8262-279161-0128 IF WE WISH TO PASS FROM THE LAW OF HABIT STATED AS A TENDENCY OR AVERAGE TO SOMETHING MORE PRECISE AND INVARIABLE WE SEEM DRIVEN TO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
8262-279161-0129 WE CAN MORE OR LESS GUESS HOW AN OCCURRENCE PRODUCES A CHANGE IN THE BRAIN AND HOW ITS REPETITION GRADUALLY PRODUCES SOMETHING ANALOGOUS TO THE CHANNEL OF A RIVER
8262-279161-0130 WOULD RESEMBLE PSYCHOLOGY RATHER THAN PHYSICS IN WHAT WE FOUND TO BE THE DECISIVE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM I THINK THAT IS TO SAY THAT SUCH AN ACCOUNT WOULD NOT BE CONTENT TO SPEAK EVEN FORMALLY AS THOUGH MATTER
8262-279161-0131 WHICH IS A LOGICAL FICTION WERE THE ULTIMATE REALITY I THINK THAT IF OUR SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE WERE ADEQUATE TO THE TASK WHICH IT NEITHER IS NOR IS LIKELY TO BECOME
8262-279161-0132 IT WOULD EXHIBIT THE LAWS OF CORRELATION OF THE PARTICULARS CONSTITUTING A MOMENTARY CONDITION OF A MATERIAL UNIT AND WOULD STATE THE CAUSAL LAWS OF THE WORLD IN TERMS OF THESE PARTICULARS NOT IN TERMS OF MATTER
8262-279161-0133 CAUSAL LAWS SO STATED WOULD I BELIEVE BE APPLICABLE TO PSYCHOLOGY AND PHYSICS EQUALLY THE SCIENCE IN WHICH THEY WERE STATED WOULD SUCCEED IN ACHIEVING WHAT METAPHYSICS HAS VAINLY ATTEMPTED
8262-279161-0134 NAMELY A UNIFIED ACCOUNT OF WHAT REALLY HAPPENS
8262-279161-0135 AND FREE FROM ALL CONVENIENT FICTIONS OR UNWARRANTABLE ASSUMPTIONS OF METAPHYSICAL ENTITIES
