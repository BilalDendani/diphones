7994-258959-0000 WEALTH AND RENT CHAPTER SEVEN WEALTH AND ITS INDIRECT USES
7994-258959-0001 ONE GOODS MAY BE RANKED ACCORDING TO THEIR TECHNICAL RELATION TO WANTS THE TECHNICAL RANK OF GOODS SOMETIMES SPOKEN OF AS THE DEGREE OF ROUNDABOUTNESS OF THE PROCESS SIGNIFIES THE NUMBER OF STEPS OR PROCESSES
7994-258959-0002 THAT INTERVENE BETWEEN THE AGENT USED AND THE DESIRED FORM IF ONE WISHING THE HICKORY NUT HANGING ABOVE HIS HEAD MUST FIRST PICK UP A STICK TO THROW AT IT THE NUT IS REMOVED ONE STEP FROM DESIRE
7994-258959-0003 BUT EVEN AMONG SAVAGES THE PROCESSES ARE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THE INDIAN WITH A CRUDE KNIFE FASHIONS HIS BOW AND ARROW FASTENS THE FLINT AND CORD WHICH REPRESENT STILL OTHER PROCESSES OF INDUSTRY
7994-258959-0004 AND SHOOTS THE BIRD WHICH SATISFIES HIS HUNGER IN MODERN CONDITIONS THE RELATIONS ARE VASTLY MORE COMPLICATED
7994-258959-0005 TWO GOODS MAY BE RANKED BY THEIR RELATION TO WANTS IN TIME THE RELATION IN RESPECT TO TIME IS MEASURED BY THE PERIOD THAT MUST ELAPSE BEFORE THE UTILITY OF AN AGENT RESULTS IN IS CONVERTED INTO
7994-258959-0006 GRATIFICATION NO AGENT OR INFLUENCE INTERVENING A THING MAY YET BE REMOVED A LONG WAY FROM GRATIFICATION A TREE MAY NOT BE FITTED TO BEAR FRUIT FOR TEN YEARS TO COME MEANTIME
7994-258959-0007 THE NUMBER OF STEPS HAS NO NECESSARY RELATION TO THE TIME A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL STEPS MAY BE TAKEN IN HALF AN HOUR OR A PROCESS OF A SINGLE TECHNICAL STEP MAY LAST A YEAR IN THE MECHANIC ARTS
7994-258959-0008 THE TECHNICAL RELATIONS ARE OF PRIMARY SIGNIFICANCE BUT IN ECONOMICS THE TIME RELATIONS ARE MAINLY TO BE CONSIDERED
7994-258959-0009 AS IMMEDIATELY ENJOYABLE GOODS AND DURABLE AGENTS ENJOYABLE GOODS ARE GOODS IN A FINAL FORM PRODUCING GRATIFICATION
7994-258959-0010 SO THAT THEIR USE IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE WINTER CIDER AND WINE ARE KEPT TILL THEY GET A QUALITY THAT APPEALS MORE TO THE PALATE COAL WOOD AND STOCKS OF GOODS ARE THUS KEPT IN THE FORM OF ENJOYABLE GOODS
7994-258959-0011 DESTINED TO BE PHYSICALLY DESTROYED WHEN AT LENGTH THEY YIELD A GRATIFICATION EVIDENTLY THEY MUST BE STORING UP MEANTIME A CERTAIN ADDITIONAL UTILITY FOR OTHERWISE THERE WOULD BE NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THE FUTURE
7994-258959-0012 SUCH GOODS AS THESE ARE SOMETIMES CALLED UNRIPENED CONSUMPTION GOODS BUT UNTIL RIPENED THEY BEAR IN PART THE CHARACTER OF DURABLE AGENTS ABIDING SOURCES OF ECONOMIC ENJOYMENTS ARE CALLED DURABLE AGENTS
7994-258959-0013 THE INHABITED HOUSE IS A SOURCE OF CONTINUED GRATIFICATION IN EACH MOMENT'S SHELTER IT AFFORDS BUT FURTHER IT IS THE DURABLE SOURCE OF A SERIES OF FUTURE USES AS YET UNRIPENED THE HAMMER THE HOE
7994-258959-0014 FOUR THIS CLASSIFICATION OF GOODS IS ABSTRACT IN THAT IT IS A CLASSIFICATION NOT OF CONCRETE GOODS BUT OF QUALITIES SHARED IN SOME DEGREE BY NEARLY ALL GOODS
7994-258959-0015 JUST AT THE MOMENT OF CONSUMPTION TO THOSE MOST DURABLE WHICH YIELD AN ENDLESS SERIES OF USES OR PRODUCTS YET THE CLASSIFICATION IS PRACTICAL CORRESPONDING AS IT DOES WITH THOUGHTS WHICH MEN HAVE IN THE USE OF GOODS
7994-258959-0016 BY REPAIRS AND OTHER METHODS GOODS BECOME AND ARE LOOKED UPON AS DURABLE SOURCES OF A SERIES OF USES IT IS TO BE NOTED FURTHER THAT THE ENJOYABLE GOODS PASS OVER INTO PSYCHIC INCOME THAT IS
7994-258959-0017 ONE THE BOUNTY AND VARIETY OF THE NATURAL SUPPLY OF INDIRECT GOODS IN THE MATERIAL WORLD ARE THE PRIME CONDITIONS OF A BOUNTIFUL INCOME TO SOCIETY
7994-258959-0018 THE SUPPLY OF MATERIAL ECONOMIC GOODS ALL THE EARLIER CIVILIZATIONS AROSE IN WARMER COUNTRIES BUT AFTER MAN HAD GAINED A CERTAIN MASTERY OVER THE OBSTACLES OF NATURE HE WAS ABLE TO SOFTEN THE HARSHER FEATURES OF CLIMATE
7994-258959-0019 SOIL CONDITIONS FOR VEGETABLE LIFE DETERMINE FIRST THE AMOUNT AND KIND OF ANIMAL LIFE ANIMAL LIFE FROM ONE POINT OF VIEW IS A PARASITE LIVING ON THE VEGETABLE IT IS ONLY THE VEGETABLE THAT HAS POWER TO ASSIMILATE MOST INORGANIC COMPOUNDS
7994-258959-0020 THE AMOUNT OF RAINFALL IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CONDITIONS OF INDUSTRY MAN THEREFORE DEPENDS ON THE RESOURCES OF THE SOIL DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY A FERTILE SOIL FURNISHES HIM EITHER DIRECTLY A SUPPLY OF VEGETABLE FOOD
7994-258959-0021 OR INDIRECTLY A SUPPLY OF ANIMAL FOOD NATURAL SUPPLIES OF METALS OF COAL AND OF TIMBER ARE IMPORTANT CONSUMPTION GOODS BUT THEY ARE ALSO INDIRECTLY THE CONDITION FOR A VAST VARIETY OF OTHER GOODS
7994-258959-0022 THE INDUSTRY THAT COULD EXIST WITHOUT IRON COPPER AND COAL
7994-258959-0023 THE VARIETY OF FLORA AND FAUNA AND THEIR FITNESS FOR MAN'S NEEDS LARGELY CONDITION THE POSSIBLE PRODUCTION IF IN THE COURSE OF EVOLUTION IT HAD CHANCED THAT WHEAT AND CORN THE HORSE AND THE COW
7994-258959-0024 HAD BEEN CROWDED OUT IN THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE WE SHOULD HAVE HAD A VERY DIFFERENT CIVILIZATION THE POSSIBILITIES OF CIVILIZATION IN PERU AND THOSE OF ALL THE INDIANS ON THE AMERICAN CONTINENT
7994-258959-0025 NOT CONTENT WITH THE MATERIAL WORLD ABOUT HIM EVEN WHEN IT IS AT ITS BEST MAN ALTERS IT IN MANY WAYS HE ENRICHES THE SOIL IMPROVES THE VARIETIES OF ANIMALS
7994-258959-0026 HE EVEN IN SOME SLIGHT DEGREE AFFECTS THE CLIMATE AND BY THE USE OF A MULTITUDE OF ARTIFICIAL BITS OF MATTER CALLED TOOLS
7994-258959-0027 THE OUTER WORLD IS TO MAN THE SOLE SOURCE OF MOTIVE FORCES HE CAN BRING THINGS TOGETHER AND THEY PRODUCE THE RESULT FURTHER IT MAY BE SAID THAT NEARLY EVERY KIND OF UTILITY IS CONDITIONED ON MOTION
7994-258959-0028 IT IS MAN'S AIM TO SECURE A CONSTANT INFLOW OF GOODS TO SECURE THIS EITHER HE MUST MOVE TO GET THE GOODS OR HE MUST CAUSE GOODS TO MOVE TOWARD HIM THE LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
7994-258959-0029 HELPS TO EXPLAIN ECONOMIC ACTION THE SUPPLY OF ENERGY IN THE UNIVERSE CANNOT BE INCREASED OR DIMINISHED BUT MAY TAKE ON NEW FORMS SO A LIMITED SUPPLY IN MAN'S CONTROL MAY TAKE ON VARIOUS FORMS
7994-258959-0030 AND SO HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON GRATIFICATIONS ONE AND THE SAME SOURCE OF ENERGY MAY BE CONVERTED INTO THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF HEAT LIGHT MOTION ELECTRICITY ET CETERA BUT THERE MUST BE SOME SOURCE
7994-258959-0031 MAN'S DESIRE IS DIRECTED TO GETTING FORCE AT THE RIGHT PLACE AND IN THE RIGHT DEGREE IF LIGHT OR HEAT IS TOO INTENSE IT CAUSES PAIN THE GLARE OF THE SUN BLINDS INSTEAD OF GIVING KEENER VISION
7994-258959-0032 A MODERATE FORCE APPLIED TO ANY OF THE SENSES GIVES THE MAXIMUM CLEARNESS OR PLEASURE MAN IS CONSTANTLY ENDEAVORING TO SECURE FORCES FROM THE OUTER WORLD AND TO ADJUST MOTION
7994-258959-0033 THREE AMONG THE MAIN SOURCES OF POWER USED BY MEN ARE FOOD DOMESTIC ANIMALS AND FUEL IN EATING FOOD MAN STORES UP FORCE IN HIS OWN BODY WHEN HE DRAWS THE BOW
7994-258959-0034 HE PUTS FORCE INTO IT TO LIE LATENT UNTIL LIBERATED AT THE RIGHT MOMENT THERE MUST BE A SOURCE OF ENERGY LIKEWISE THAT MENTAL ACTION MAY GO ON AND THE POWER OF SUNBEAMS STORED FOR A TIME IN FOOD
7994-258959-0035 IS LIBERATED IN THE PROCESSES OF THOUGHT THIS FIRST NATURAL MODE OF LIBERATING ENERGY WITHIN THEIR OWN BODIES DOES NOT SATISFY THE GROWING NEEDS AND AIMS OF MEN SUCH A MODE IS LABOR
7994-258959-0036 WHICH BECOMES AT TIMES PAINFUL AND DISTASTEFUL IN THE EARLIEST SOCIETIES KNOWN SOME SORTS OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS ARE FOUND SUPPLEMENTING MAN'S EFFORTS AND ACTING UPON THE MATERIAL WORLD TO ALTER IT FOR MAN
7994-258959-0037 THE DOG JOINING IN THE CHASE GUARDS HIS MASTER'S SAFETY AND HELPS TO BEAR HIS BURDENS THE DRAFT BEAST IN THE FIELD TURNS THE HEAVY SOIL AND AIDS IN THE FINAL HARVEST
7994-258959-0038 THE TRAINED ELEPHANT DOES THE WORK OF TWENTY MEN PILING LOGS LOADING SHIPS OR CARRYING BURDENS MAN FURTHER INCREASES HIS CONTROL OVER THE MATERIAL WORLD BY MAKING OTHER MEN DO HIS BIDDING DOMESTIC SLAVERY
7994-258959-0039 WHERE WIFE OR CHILD SERVES THE FATHER OF THE FAMILY OR CHATTEL SLAVERY WHERE THE VANQUISHED TOILS FOR THE VICTOR ARE ALL BUT UNIVERSAL IN EARLY COMMUNITIES SUCH A METHOD OF INCREASING ONE'S CONTROL OVER THE FORCES OF THE WORLD
7994-258959-0040 REQUIRES ONLY SUPERIOR STRENGTH NO SPECIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MECHANICS AND IS THUS ONE OF THE FIRST CRUDE DEVICES IN A PRIMITIVE CIVILIZATION FUEL HAS BEEN UP TO THE PRESENT TIME PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT SOURCE OF ENERGY
7994-258959-0041 FIRE IN THE HANDS OF SAVAGE MAN GAVE HIM DOMINION OVER THE FORESTS AND OVER THE METALS IN THIS AGE OF STEAM THE LIBERATION OF THE ENERGY OF THE SUN STORED UP IN COAL IN AGES PAST
7994-258959-0042 ARE IN WIND AND WATER WHILE THE SUPPLY OF FUEL IS BEING USED AT A PROGRESSIVE RATE AND WILL SOON APPROACH EXHAUSTION THERE ARE ELSEWHERE EXHAUSTLESS STORES OF ENERGY AWAITING MAN'S COMMAND TO MAKE USE OF THE WIND FOR SAILING A BOAT
7994-258959-0043 IF SOME MEANS CAN BE FOUND FOR EQUALIZING THE FLOW AND FOR STORING THE POWER OF THE WIND IT MAY YET BECOME A GREAT AGENCY OF INDUSTRY THE FORCE OF FALLING WATER LONG USED IN A PETTY WAY BY THE OLD WATER MILLS
7994-258959-0044 BUT WAVE MOTION IS TOO IRREGULAR TO SERVE WELL THE NEEDS FOR POWER BUT THE CONSTANT MOTION OF THE TIDES OFFERS AT SOME FAVORED POINTS
7994-258959-0045 FIVE MAN STUDIES AND COMPARES THE DURABLE GOODS THAT GIVE HIM COMMAND OVER ENJOYABLE GOODS AND ATTACHES VALUE TO THEM THUS ENERGY IS FOUND DISSIPATING ITSELF THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IN WAYS USELESS TO MAN
7994-258959-0046 WHERE IT CANNOT SERVE HIS PURPOSES AS MAN GROWS IN POWER OF CONTROL OVER NATURE HE SEEKS TO APPLY THESE FORCES IN FORMS AND AT PLACES HE HAS SELECTED IF HE CAN ARM HIMSELF WITH THE ENERGIES OF MINE AND TORRENT
7994-258959-0047 HE CEASES TO ACCEPT PASSIVELY ITS CONDITIONS AND TO LIVE ON ITS GRUDGING GIFTS HE BECOMES ITS FASHIONER IN A SENSE ITS CREATOR
7994-258959-0048 HIS INTELLIGENCE AND HIS WANTS ARE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS DETERMINING WHAT THE FORM OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD ABOUT HIM SHALL BE BUT ALL THE EFFORTS OF MEN IN THE MOST DEVELOPED ECONOMY CANNOT MAKE TO DISAPPEAR
7994-258959-0049 THE DIFFERENCES IN THE QUALITY OF GOODS AND AGENTS DESIRABLE GOODS TO CONSUME ARE LIMITED IN QUANTITY AND THEY VARY IN QUALITY HENCE THEY HAVE VALUE AND SOME HIGHER THAN OTHERS LIKEWISE DURABLE MATERIAL AGENTS
7994-258959-0050 AND SOURCES OF POWER ARE LIMITED IN NUMBER AND VARY IN CONVENIENCE OF LOCATION AND EFFICIENCY AS MEN SEEK TO GRATIFY THEIR DESIRES THEY ATTACH IMPORTANCE TO THESE AGENTS OF POWER EACH IS VALUED FOR ITS SERVICE OR ITS SERIES OF SERVICES
