7169-89735-0000 THE MAN FROM SCOTLAND YARD HAD JUST SURRENDERED HAT COAT AND UMBRELLA TO THE VESTIAIRE AND WAS TURNING THROUGH SWINGING DOORS TO THE DINING ROOM AGAIN EMBRACING LANYARD HIS GLANCE SEEMED DEVOID OF ANY SORT OF INTELLIGIBLE EXPRESSION AND IF ITS OBJECT NEEDED ALL HIS SELF POSSESSION IN THAT MOMENT
7169-89735-0001 IT WAS TO DISSEMBLE RELIEF RATHER THAN DISMAY AN ACCENT OF THE FORTUITOUS DISTINGUISHED THIS SECOND ENCOUNTER TOO PERSUASIVELY TO EXCUSE FURTHER MISGIVINGS WHAT THE ADVENTURER HIMSELF HADN'T KNOWN TILL WITHIN THE LAST TEN MINUTES THAT HE WAS COMING TO TROYON'S
7169-89735-0002 RODDY COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE ANTICIPATED ERGO WHATEVER THE DETECTIVE'S BUSINESS IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH LANYARD FURTHERMORE BEFORE QUITTING THE LOBBY RODDY PAUSED LONG ENOUGH TO INSTRUCT THE VESTIAIRE TO HAVE A FIRE LAID IN HIS ROOM SO HE WAS STOPPING AT TROYON'S AND DIDN'T CARE WHO KNEW IT
7169-89735-0003 HIS DOUBTS ALTOGETHER DISSIPATED BY THIS INCIDENT LANYARD FOLLOWED HIS NATURAL ENEMY INTO THE DINING ROOM WITH AN AIR AS DEVIL MAY CARE AS ONE COULD WISH AND SO IMPRESSIVE THAT THE MAITRE D'HOTEL ABANDONED THE DETECTIVE TO THE MERCIES OF ONE OF HIS CAPTAINS AND HIMSELF HASTENED TO SEAT LANYARD AND TAKE HIS ORDER
7169-89735-0004 THIS LAST DISPOSED OF LANYARD SURRENDERED HIMSELF TO NEW IMPRESSIONS OF WHICH THE FIRST PROVED A BIT DISHEARTENING HOWEVER IMPULSIVELY HE HADN'T RESOUGHT TROYON'S WITHOUT DEFINITE INTENT TO WIT TO GAIN SOME CLUE HOWEVER SLENDER TO THE MYSTERY OF THAT WRETCHED CHILD MARCEL
7169-89735-0005 BUT NOW IT APPEARED HE HAD PROCRASTINATED FATALLY TIME AND CHANGE HAD LEFT LITTLE OTHER THAN THE SHELL OF THE TROYON'S HE REMEMBERED
7169-89735-0006 MADAME NO LONGER OCCUPIED THE DESK OF THE CAISSE ENQUIRIES SO DISCREETLY WORDED AS TO BE UNCOMPROMISING ELICITED FROM THE MAITRE D'HOTEL THE INFORMATION THAT THE HOUSE HAD BEEN UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT THESE EIGHTEEN MONTHS THE OLD PROPRIETOR WAS DEAD
7169-89735-0007 AND HIS WIDOW HAD SOLD OUT LOCK STOCK AND BARREL AND RETIRED TO THE COUNTRY IT WAS NOT KNOWN EXACTLY WHERE AND WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION HAD COME FRESH DECORATIONS AND FURNISHINGS AS WELL AS A COMPLETE CHANGE OF PERSONNEL NOT EVEN ONE OF THE OLD WAITERS REMAINED ALL
7169-89735-0008 ALL ARE GONE THE OLD FAMILIAR FACES LANYARD QUOTED IN VINDICTIVE MELANCHOLY DAMN EM HAPPILY
7169-89735-0009 OTHER IMPRESSIONS LESS ULTIMATE PROVED PUZZLING DISCONCERTING AND PARADOXICALLY REASSURING LANYARD COMMANDED A FAIR VIEW OF RODDY ACROSS THE WAIST OF THE ROOM THE DETECTIVE HAD ORDERED A MEAL THAT MATCHED HIS ASPECT WELL BOTH OF TRUE BRITISH SIMPLICITY
7169-89735-0010 HE WAS A SQUARE SET MAN WITH A SQUARE JAW COLD BLUE EYES A FAT NOSE A THIN LIPPED TRAP OF A MOUTH
7169-89735-0011 HIS DINNER COMPRISED A CUT FROM THE JOINT BOILED POTATOES BRUSSELS SPROUTS A BIT OF CHEESE A BOTTLE OF BASS HE ATE SLOWLY CHEWING WITH THE DOGGEDNESS OF A STRONG CHARACTER HAMPERED BY A WEAK DIGESTION
7169-89735-0012 AND ALL THE WHILE KEPT EYES FIXED TO AN ISSUE OF THE PARIS EDITION OF THE LONDON DAILY MAIL WITH AN EFFECT OF CONCENTRATION QUITE TOO CONVINCING NOW ONE DOESN'T READ THE PARIS EDITION OF THE LONDON DAILY MAIL WITH TENSE EXCITEMENT HUMANLY SPEAKING IT CAN'T BE DONE
7169-89735-0013 WHERE THEN WAS THE OBJECT OF THIS SO SEDULOUSLY DISSEMBLED INTEREST LANYARD WASN'T SLOW TO READ THIS RIDDLE TO HIS SATISFACTION IN AS FAR THAT IS AS IT WAS SATISFACTORY TO FEEL STILL MORE CERTAIN THAT RODDY'S QUARRY WAS ANOTHER THAN HIMSELF
7169-89735-0014 DESPITE THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR WHICH HAD BY NOW TURNED TEN O'CLOCK THE RESTAURANT HAD A DOZEN TABLES OR SO IN THE SERVICE OF GUESTS PLEASANTLY ENGAGED IN LENGTHENING OUT AN AGREEABLE EVENING WITH DESSERT
7169-89735-0015 THE MAJORITY OF THESE WERE IN COUPLES BUT AT A TABLE ONE REMOVED FROM RODDY'S SAT A PARTY OF THREE AND LANYARD NOTICED OR FANCIED THAT THE MAN FROM SCOTLAND YARD TURNED HIS NEWSPAPER ONLY DURING LULLS IN THE CONVERSATION IN THIS QUARTER OF THE THREE
7169-89735-0016 ONE MIGHT PASS FOR AN AMERICAN OF POSITION AND WEALTH
7169-89735-0017 FURROWED SEAMED TWISTED A MASK OF MORTAL ANGUISH AND ONCE WHEN THIS ONE LOOKED UP AND CASUALLY ENCOUNTERED LANYARD'S GAZE THE ADVENTURER WAS SHOCKED TO FIND HIMSELF STARING INTO EYES LIKE THOSE OF A DEAD MAN
7169-89735-0018 LEAVING VISIBLE ONLY THE ROUND BLACK POINTS OF PUPILS ABNORMALLY DISTENDED AND STARING BLANK FIXED PASSIONLESS BENEATH LASHLESS LIDS FOR THE INSTANT THEY SEEMED TO EXPLORE LANYARD'S VERY SOUL WITH A LOOK OF REMOTE AND IMPERSONAL CURIOSITY
7169-89735-0019 THEN THEY FELL AWAY AND WHEN NEXT THE ADVENTURER LOOKED THE MAN HAD TURNED TO ATTEND TO SOME OBSERVATION OF ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS ON HIS RIGHT SAT A GIRL WHO MIGHT BE HIS DAUGHTER FOR NOT ONLY WAS SHE TOO HALL MARKED AMERICAN BUT SHE WAS FAR TOO YOUNG TO BE THE OTHER'S WIFE
7169-89735-0020 A DEMURE OLD FASHIONED TYPE WELL POISED BUT UNASSUMING FETCHINGLY GOWNED AND WITH SUFFICIENT INDIVIDUALITY OF TASTE BUT NOT CONSPICUOUSLY A GIRL WITH SOFT BROWN HAIR AND SOFT BROWN EYES PRETTY NOT EXTRAVAGANTLY SO WHEN HER FACE WAS IN REPOSE
7169-89735-0021 BUT WITH A SLOW SMILE THAT RENDERED HER LITTLE LESS THAN BEAUTIFUL IN ALL LANYARD THOUGHT THE KIND OF WOMAN THAT IS PREDESTINED TO COMFORT MANKIND WHOSE STRONGEST INSTINCT IS THE MATERNAL SHE TOOK LITTLE PART IN THE CONVERSATION
7169-89735-0022 SELDOM INTERRUPTING WHAT WAS PRACTICALLY A DUOLOGUE BETWEEN HER PUTATIVE FATHER AND THE THIRD OF THEIR PARTY THIS LAST WAS ONE WHOM LANYARD WAS SURE HE KNEW THOUGH HE COULD SEE NO MORE THAN THE BACK OF MONSIEUR LE COMTE REMY DE MORBIHAN
7169-89735-0023 AND HE WONDERED WITH A THRILL OF AMUSEMENT IF IT WERE POSSIBLE THAT RODDY WAS ON THE TRAIL OF THAT TREMENDOUS BUCK IF SO IT WOULD BE A CHASE WORTH FOLLOWING A DIVERSION RENDERED THE MORE EXQUISITE TO LANYARD BY THE SPICE OF NOVELTY SINCE FOR ONCE HE WOULD FIGURE AS A DISPASSIONATE BYSTANDER
7169-89735-0024 WAS ONE TO CONJURE WITH IN THE PARIS OF HIS DAY AND GENERATION HE CLAIMED THE DISTINCTION OF BEING AT ONCE THE HOMELIEST ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST AND THE MOST LIKED MAN IN FRANCE AS TO HIS LOOKS GOOD OR BAD THEY WERE SAID TO PROVE INFALLIBLY FATAL WITH WOMEN
7169-89735-0025 WHILE NOT A FEW MEN PERHAPS FOR THAT REASON DID THEIR POSSESSOR THE HONOUR TO IMITATE THEM
7169-89735-0026 MOON LIKE MASK WITH WAXED MOUSTACHES WOMANISH EYES AND NEVER FAILING GRIN
7169-89735-0027 HIS EXTRAORDINARY POPULARITY WAS DUE TO THE EQUALLY EXTRAORDINARY EXTRAVAGANCE WITH WHICH HE SUPPORTED THAT LATEST GALLIC FAD LE SPORT THE PARISIAN RUGBY TEAM WAS HIS PAMPERED PROTEGE HE WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE TENNIS CLUB MAINTAINED NOT ONLY A FLOCK OF AUTOMOBILES BUT A FAMOUS RACING STABLE
7169-89735-0028 RODE TO HOUNDS WAS A GOOD FIELD GUN PATRONIZED AVIATION AND MOTOR BOAT RACING RISKED AS MANY MAXIMUMS DURING THE MONTE CARLO SEASON AS THE GRAND DUKE MICHAEL HIMSELF
7169-89735-0029 LANYARD FOR ONE WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT HIM THE PROPEREST COMPANY OR THE BEST PARISIAN CICERONE FOR AN AILING AMERICAN GENTLEMAN BLESSED WITH INDEPENDENT MEANS AND AN ATTRACTIVE DAUGHTER PARIS ON THE OTHER HAND PARIS WHO FORGIVES EVERYTHING TO HIM WHO CONTRIBUTES TO HER AMUSEMENT
7169-89735-0030 BUT PERHAPS LANYARD WAS PREJUDICED BY HIS PARTIALITY FOR AMERICANS A SENTIMENT THE OUTGROWTH OF THE YEARS SPENT IN NEW YORK WITH BOURKE HE EVEN FANCIED THAT BETWEEN HIS SPIRIT AND THEIRS EXISTED SOME SUBTLE BOND OF SYMPATHY FOR ALL HE KNEW HE MIGHT HIMSELF BE AMERICAN
7169-89735-0031 FOR SOME TIME LANYARD STRAINED TO CATCH SOMETHING OF THE CONVERSATION THAT SEEMED TO HOLD SO MUCH OF INTEREST FOR RODDY BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS BECAUSE OF THE HUM OF VOICES THAT FILLED THE ROOM IN TIME HOWEVER
7169-89735-0032 THE GATHERING BEGAN TO THIN OUT UNTIL AT LENGTH THERE REMAINED ONLY THIS PARTY OF THREE LANYARD ENJOYING A MOST DELECTABLE SALAD AND RODDY PUFFING A CIGAR
7169-89735-0033 AND SLOWLY GULPING DOWN A SECOND BOTTLE OF BASS
7169-89735-0034 THE FIRST REMARK OVERHEARD BY LANYARD CAME FROM THE ELDERLY AMERICAN FOLLOWING A PAUSE AND A CONSULTATION OF HIS WATCH QUARTER TO ELEVEN HE ANNOUNCED
7169-89735-0035 IF MADEMOISELLE ISN'T BORED THE GIRL'S REPLY ACCOMPANIED BY A PRETTY INCLINATION OF HER HEAD TOWARD THE FRENCHMAN WAS LOST IN THE ACCENTS OF THE FIRST SPEAKER A STRONG AND SONOROUS VOICE IN STRANGE CONTRAST WITH HIS RAVAGED APPEARANCE AND DISTRESSING COUGH
7169-89735-0036 DON'T LET THAT WORRY YOU HE ADVISED CHEERFULLY
7169-89735-0037 SEE WHAT WE FOUND THERE TO DAY SHE SLIPPED A RING FROM HER HAND AND PASSED IT TO DE MORBIHAN THERE FOLLOWED SILENCE FOR AN INSTANT THEN AN EXCLAMATION FROM THE FRENCHMAN BUT IT IS SUPERB ACCEPT MADEMOISELLE MY COMPLIMENTS IT IS WORTHY EVEN OF YOU
7169-89735-0038 SHE FLUSHED PRETTILY AS SHE NODDED SMILING ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
7169-89735-0039 YOU FILL US WITH ENVY YOU HAVE THE SOULS OF POETS AND THE WEALTH OF PRINCES BUT WE MUST COME TO PARIS TO FIND BEAUTIFUL THINGS FOR OUR WOMEN FOLK TAKE CARE THOUGH LEST YOU GO TOO FAR MONSIEUR BANNON HOW SO TOO FAR YOU MIGHT ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE LONE WOLF
7169-89735-0040 THEY SAY HE'S ON THE PROWL ONCE MORE THE AMERICAN LAUGHED A TRACE CONTEMPTUOUSLY LANYARD'S FINGERS TIGHTENED ON HIS KNIFE AND FORK OTHERWISE HE MADE NO SIGN A SIDELONG GLANCE INTO A MIRROR AT HIS ELBOW SHOWED RODDY STILL ABSORBED IN THE DAILY MAIL
7169-89735-0041 THE GIRL BENT FORWARD WITH A LOOK OF EAGER INTEREST THE LONE WOLF WHO IS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW HIM IN AMERICA MADEMOISELLE NO
7169-89735-0042 BUT HE OPERATES IN A MOST INDIVIDUAL WAY AND KEEPS THE POLICE BUSY TRYING TO GUESS WHERE HE'LL STRIKE NEXT THE GIRL BREATHED AN INCREDULOUS EXCLAMATION
7169-89735-0043 THE ROGUE HAS HAD A WONDERFULLY SUCCESSFUL CAREER THANKS TO HIS DISPENSING WITH CONFEDERATES AND CONFINING HIS DEPREDATIONS TO JEWELS AND SIMILAR VALUABLES PORTABLE AND EASY TO CONVERT INTO CASH YET HE ADDED NODDING SAGELY ONE ISN'T AFRAID TO PREDICT HIS RACE IS ALMOST RUN
7169-89735-0044 YOU DON'T TELL ME THE OLDER MAN EXCLAIMED HAVE THEY PICKED UP THE SCENT AT LAST
7169-89735-0045 BY NOW THE CONVERSATION HAD CAUGHT THE INTEREST OF SEVERAL LOITERING WAITERS
7169-89735-0046 HE CALLED QUIETLY AND ORDERED COFFEE AND CIGARS WITH A LIQUEUR TO FOLLOW KNOWN THE AMERICAN EXCLAIMED THEY'VE CAUGHT HIM EH I DIDN'T SAY THAT DE MORBIHAN LAUGHED BUT THE MYSTERY IS NO MORE IN CERTAIN QUARTERS WHO IS HE THEN THAT MONSIEUR WILL PARDON ME
7169-89735-0047 I'M NOT YET FREE TO STATE INDEED I MAY BE INDISCREET IN SAYING AS MUCH AS I DO YET AMONG FRIENDS HIS SHRUG IMPLIED THAT AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED WAITERS WERE UNHUMAN AND THE OTHER GUESTS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT NON EXISTENT
7169-89735-0048 BUT THE AMERICAN PERSISTED PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL US HOW THEY GOT ON HIS TRACK IT WASN'T DIFFICULT SAID DE MORBIHAN INDEED QUITE SIMPLE THIS TONE OF DEPRECIATION IS BECOMING FOR IT WAS MY PART TO SUGGEST THE SOLUTION TO MY FRIEND THE CHIEF OF THE SURETE
7169-89735-0049 AND SINCE HE IS MY FRIEND I TOO WAS DISTRESSED ON HIS BEHALF AND BADGERED MY POOR WITS UNTIL THEY CHANCED UPON AN IDEA WHICH LED US TO THE LIGHT YOU WON'T TELL US THE GIRL PROTESTED WITH A LITTLE MOUE OF DISAPPOINTMENT AS THE FRENCHMAN PAUSED PROVOKINGLY PERHAPS I SHOULDN'T
7169-89735-0050 AND YET WHY NOT AS I SAY IT WAS ELEMENTARY REASONING A MERE MATTER OF LOGICAL DEDUCTION AND ELIMINATION ONE MADE UP ONE'S MIND THE LONE WOLF MUST BE A CERTAIN SORT OF MAN THE REST WAS SIMPLY SIFTING FRANCE FOR THE MAN TO FIT THE THEORY
7169-89735-0051 NO I MUST CONTINUE VERY WELL I CONFESS TO SOME LITTLE PRIDE IT WAS A FEAT HE IS CUNNING THAT ONE DE MORBIHAN PAUSED AND SHIFTED SIDEWAYS IN HIS CHAIR GRINNING LIKE A MISCHIEVOUS CHILD BY THIS MANOEUVRE
7169-89735-0052 THANKS TO THE ARRANGEMENT OF MIRRORS LINING THE WALLS HE COMMANDED AN INDIRECT VIEW OF LANYARD A FACT OF WHICH THE LATTER WAS NOT UNAWARE THOUGH HIS EXPRESSION REMAINED UNCHANGED AS HE SAT WITH A CORNER OF HIS EYE RESERVED FOR RODDY
7169-89735-0053 SPECULATING WHETHER DE MORBIHAN WERE TELLING THE TRUTH OR ONLY BOASTING FOR HIS OWN GLORIFICATION DO GO ON PLEASE THE GIRL BEGGED PRETTILY I CAN DENY YOU NOTHING MADEMOISELLE WELL THEN FROM WHAT LITTLE WAS KNOWN OF THIS MYSTERIOUS CREATURE
7169-89735-0054 THAT IS CLEAR I TRUST TOO DEEP FOR ME MY FRIEND THE ELDERLY MAN CONFESSED IMPENETRABLE RETICENCE THE COUNT EXPOUNDED SENTENTIOUS AND ENJOYING HIMSELF HUGELY ISN'T POSSIBLE IN THE HUMAN RELATIONS
7169-89735-0055 EVEN UNCONSCIOUSLY WITH A WIFE A MISTRESS A CHILD
7169-89735-0056 AND A SECRET BETWEEN TWO IS A PROLIFIC BREEDER OF PLATITUDES GRANTED THIS LINE OF REASONING THE LONE WOLF IS OF NECESSITY NOT ONLY UNMARRIED BUT PRACTICALLY FRIENDLESS OTHER ATTRIBUTES OF HIS WILL OBVIOUSLY COMPRISE YOUTH COURAGE IMAGINATION
7169-89735-0057 A RATHER HIGH ORDER OF INTELLIGENCE AND A SOCIAL POSITION LET US SAY RATHER AN OSTENSIBLE BUSINESS ENABLING HIM TO TRAVEL AT WILL HITHER AND YON WITHOUT EXCITING COMMENT SO FAR GOOD
7169-89735-0058 AND BY THIS MEANS SEVERAL FINE FISH WERE ENMESHED IN THE NET OF SUSPICION CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZED AND ONE BY ONE LET GO ALL EXCEPT ONE THE VERITABLE MAN HIM THEY SEDULOUSLY WATCHED SHADOWING HIM ACROSS EUROPE AND BACK AGAIN
7169-89735-0059 HE WAS IN BERLIN AT THE TIME OF THE FAMOUS RHEINART ROBBERY THOUGH HE COMPASSED THAT COUP WITHOUT DETECTION HE WAS IN VIENNA WHEN THE BRITISH EMBASSY THERE WAS LOOTED
7169-89735-0060 RECENTLY HE HAS BEEN IN LONDON AND THERE HE MADE LOVE TO AND RAN AWAY WITH THE DIAMONDS OF A CERTAIN LADY OF SOME EMINENCE YOU HAVE HEARD OF MADAME OMBER EH NOW BY RODDY'S EXPRESSION IT WAS PLAIN THAT IF MADAME OMBER'S NAME WASN'T STRANGE IN HIS HEARING
7169-89735-0061 AT LEAST HE FOUND THIS NEWS ABOUT HER MOST SURPRISING
7169-89735-0062 LANYARD GENTLY PINCHED THE SMALL END OF A CIGAR DIPPED IT INTO HIS COFFEE AND LIGHTED IT WITH NOT SO MUCH AS A SUSPICION OF TREMOR HIS BRAIN HOWEVER
7169-89735-0063 WAS WORKING RAPIDLY IN EFFORT TO DETERMINE WHETHER DE MORBIHAN MEANT THIS FOR WARNING OR WAS SIMPLY NARRATING AN AMUSING YARN FOUNDED ON ADVANCE INFORMATION AND AMPLIFIED BY AN INGENIOUS IMAGINATION FOR BY NOW THE NEWS OF THE OMBER AFFAIR MUST HAVE THRILLED MANY A CONTINENTAL TELEGRAPH WIRE
7169-89735-0064 MADAME OMBER OF COURSE THE AMERICAN AGREED THOUGHTFULLY EVERYONE HAS HEARD OF HER WONDERFUL JEWELS THE REAL MARVEL IS THAT THE LONE WOLF NEGLECTED SO SHINING A MARK AS LONG AS HE DID BUT TRULY SO MONSIEUR AND THEY CAUGHT HIM AT IT EH NOT PRECISELY

7169-89735-0074 AND IF THEY WERE THE FIRST TO FALL IT WAS WITH AN EFFECT OF CURIOSITY SATED WITHOUT HINT OF DISCOMFITURE AND SOMEHOW THE ADVENTURER FELT HIMSELF MEASURED CLASSIFIED FILED AWAY BETWEEN AMUSEMENT AND PIQUE HE CONTINUED TO STARE WHILE THE ELDERLY AMERICAN RECOVERED HIS BREATH
