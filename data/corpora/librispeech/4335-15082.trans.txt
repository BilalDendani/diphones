4335-15082-0000 HAD BEEN SHARED IN AN EQUAL DEGREE BY SMALLER BANDS WHO HAD WINTERED IN REMOTE AND SECRET RETREATS OF THE WILDERNESS OF THOSE WHO SURVIVED THAT SEASON OF DEATH MANY WERE SO WEAKENED
4335-15082-0001 THAT THEY COULD NOT ENDURE THE HARDSHIPS OF A WANDERING LIFE WHICH WAS NEW TO THEM THE HURONS LIVED BY AGRICULTURE THEIR FIELDS AND CROPS WERE DESTROYED AND THEY WERE SO HUNTED FROM PLACE TO PLACE THAT THEY COULD RARELY TILL THE SOIL
4335-15082-0002 GAME WAS VERY SCARCE AND WITHOUT AGRICULTURE THE COUNTRY COULD SUPPORT ONLY A SCANTY AND SCATTERED POPULATION LIKE THAT WHICH MAINTAINED A STRUGGLING EXISTENCE IN THE WILDERNESS OF THE LOWER SAINT LAWRENCE
4335-15082-0003 THE MORTALITY AMONG THE EXILES WAS PRODIGIOUS IT IS A MATTER OF SOME INTEREST TO TRACE THE FORTUNES OF THE SHATTERED FRAGMENTS OF A NATION ONCE PROSPEROUS AND IN ITS OWN EYES AND THOSE OF ITS NEIGHBORS POWERFUL AND GREAT
4335-15082-0004 NONE WERE LEFT ALIVE WITHIN THEIR ANCIENT DOMAIN SOME HAD SOUGHT REFUGE AMONG THE NEUTRALS AND THE ERIES AND SHARED THE DISASTERS WHICH SOON OVERWHELMED THOSE TRIBES
4335-15082-0005 HAD RECOURSE TO AN EXPEDIENT WHICH SEEMS EQUALLY STRANGE AND DESPERATE BUT WHICH WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDIAN PRACTICES THEY CONTRIVED TO OPEN A COMMUNICATION WITH THE SENECA NATION OF THE IROQUOIS
4335-15082-0006 AND PROMISED TO CHANGE THEIR NATIONALITY AND TURN SENECAS AS THE PRICE OF THEIR LIVES THE VICTORS ACCEPTED THE PROPOSAL AND THE INHABITANTS OF THESE TWO TOWNS JOINED BY A FEW OTHER HURONS
4335-15082-0007 MIGRATED IN A BODY TO THE SENECA COUNTRY THEY WERE NOT DISTRIBUTED AMONG DIFFERENT VILLAGES BUT WERE ALLOWED TO FORM A TOWN BY THEMSELVES
4335-15082-0008 BUT AT LENGTH THEY TOO WERE COMPELLED TO FLY TOGETHER WITH SUCH OTHER HURONS AS HAD TAKEN REFUGE WITH THEM THEY MADE THEIR WAY NORTHWARD AND SETTLED ON THE ISLAND OF MICHILIMACKINAC WHERE THEY WERE JOINED BY THE OTTAWAS WHO WITH OTHER ALGONQUINS
4335-15082-0009 HAD BEEN DRIVEN BY FEAR OF THE IROQUOIS FROM THE WESTERN SHORES OF LAKE HURON AND THE BANKS OF THE RIVER OTTAWA AT MICHILIMACKINAC THE HURONS AND THEIR ALLIES WERE AGAIN ATTACKED BY THE IROQUOIS
4335-15082-0010 AND AFTER REMAINING SEVERAL YEARS THEY MADE ANOTHER REMOVE AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THE ISLANDS AT THE MOUTH OF THE GREEN BAY OF LAKE MICHIGAN EVEN HERE THEIR OLD ENEMY DID NOT LEAVE THEM IN PEACE
4335-15082-0011 WHEREUPON THEY FORTIFIED THEMSELVES ON THE MAIN LAND AND AFTERWARDS MIGRATED SOUTHWARD AND WESTWARD THIS BROUGHT THEM IN CONTACT WITH THE ILLINOIS AN ALGONQUIN PEOPLE AT THAT TIME VERY NUMEROUS
4335-15082-0012 BUT WHO LIKE MANY OTHER TRIBES AT THIS EPOCH WERE DOOMED TO A RAPID DIMINUTION FROM WARS WITH OTHER SAVAGE NATIONS CONTINUING THEIR MIGRATION WESTWARD THE HURONS AND OTTAWAS REACHED THE MISSISSIPPI WHERE THEY FELL IN WITH THE SIOUX
4335-15082-0013 THEY SOON QUARRELLED WITH THOSE FIERCE CHILDREN OF THE PRAIRIE WHO DROVE THEM FROM THEIR COUNTRY THEY RETREATED TO THE SOUTH WESTERN EXTREMITY OF LAKE SUPERIOR AND SETTLED ON POINT SAINT ESPRIT OR SHAGWAMIGON POINT
4335-15082-0014 NEAR THE ISLANDS OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES AS THE SIOUX CONTINUED TO HARASS THEM THEY LEFT THIS PLACE ABOUT THE YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND RETURNED TO MICHILIMACKINAC WHERE THEY SETTLED NOT ON THE ISLAND BUT ON THE NEIGHBORING
4335-15082-0015 POINT SAINT IGNACE NOW GRAHAM'S POINT ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE STRAIT
4335-15082-0016 WHERE A REMNANT OF THEM MAY STILL BE FOUND
4335-15082-0017 THEY TOOK POSSESSION OF THE STONE FORT WHICH THE FRENCH HAD ABANDONED AND WHERE WITH REASONABLE VIGILANCE THEY COULD MAINTAIN THEMSELVES AGAINST ATTACK IN THE SUCCEEDING AUTUMN A SMALL IROQUOIS WAR PARTY HAD THE AUDACITY TO CROSS OVER TO THE ISLAND
4335-15082-0018 AND BUILD A FORT OF FELLED TREES IN THE WOODS THE HURONS ATTACKED THEM BUT THE INVADERS MADE SO FIERCE A DEFENCE THAT THEY KEPT THEIR ASSAILANTS AT BAY AND AT LENGTH RETREATED WITH LITTLE OR NO LOSS
4335-15082-0019 SOON AFTER A MUCH LARGER BAND OF ONONDAGA IROQUOIS APPROACHING UNDISCOVERED BUILT A FORT ON THE MAIN LAND OPPOSITE THE ISLAND BUT CONCEALED FROM SIGHT IN THE FOREST HERE THEY WAITED TO WAYLAY ANY PARTY OF HURONS WHO MIGHT VENTURE ASHORE
4335-15082-0020 A HURON WAR CHIEF NAMED ETIENNE
4335-15082-0021 WHOSE LIFE IS DESCRIBED AS A SUCCESSION OF CONFLICTS AND ADVENTURES AND WHO IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN ALWAYS IN LUCK LANDED WITH A FEW COMPANIONS AND FELL INTO AN AMBUSCADE OF THE IROQUOIS
4335-15082-0022 HE PREPARED TO DEFEND HIMSELF WHEN THEY CALLED OUT TO HIM THAT THEY CAME NOT AS ENEMIES BUT AS FRIENDS AND THAT THEY BROUGHT WAMPUM BELTS AND PRESENTS TO PERSUADE THE HURONS TO FORGET THE PAST
4335-15082-0023 AND LIVE WITH THEM AS ONE NATION ETIENNE SUSPECTED TREACHERY BUT CONCEALED HIS DISTRUST AND ADVANCED TOWARDS THE IROQUOIS WITH AN AIR OF THE UTMOST CONFIDENCE THEY RECEIVED HIM WITH OPEN ARMS AND PRESSED HIM TO ACCEPT THEIR INVITATION
4335-15082-0024 BUT HE REPLIED THAT THERE WERE OLDER AND WISER MEN AMONG THE HURONS WHOSE COUNSELS ALL THE PEOPLE FOLLOWED AND THAT THEY OUGHT TO LAY THE PROPOSAL BEFORE THEM HE PROCEEDED TO ADVISE THEM TO KEEP HIM AS A HOSTAGE AND SEND OVER HIS COMPANIONS WITH SOME OF THEIR CHIEFS
4335-15082-0025 TO OPEN THE NEGOTIATION HIS APPARENT FRANKNESS COMPLETELY DECEIVED THEM AND THEY INSISTED THAT HE HIMSELF SHOULD GO TO THE HURON VILLAGE WHILE HIS COMPANIONS REMAINED AS HOSTAGES HE SET OUT ACCORDINGLY WITH THREE OF THE PRINCIPAL IROQUOIS
4335-15082-0026 WHEN HE REACHED THE VILLAGE HE GAVE THE WHOOP OF ONE WHO BRINGS GOOD TIDINGS AND PROCLAIMED WITH A LOUD VOICE THAT THE HEARTS OF THEIR ENEMIES HAD CHANGED THAT THE IROQUOIS WOULD BECOME THEIR COUNTRYMEN AND BROTHERS
4335-15082-0027 AND THAT THEY SHOULD EXCHANGE THEIR MISERIES FOR A LIFE OF PEACE AND PLENTY IN A FERTILE AND PROSPEROUS LAND THE WHOLE HURON POPULATION FULL OF JOYFUL EXCITEMENT CROWDED ABOUT HIM AND THE THREE ENVOYS WHO WERE CONDUCTED TO THE PRINCIPAL LODGE AND FEASTED
4335-15082-0028 ON THE BEST THAT THE VILLAGE COULD SUPPLY ETIENNE SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ASIDE FOUR OR FIVE OF THE PRINCIPAL CHIEFS AND SECRETLY TELL THEM HIS SUSPICIONS THAT THE IROQUOIS WERE PLOTTING
4335-15082-0029 TO COMPASS THEIR DESTRUCTION UNDER COVER OF OVERTURES OF PEACE AND HE PROPOSED THAT THEY SHOULD MEET TREACHERY WITH TREACHERY HE THEN EXPLAINED HIS PLAN WHICH WAS HIGHLY APPROVED BY HIS AUDITORS WHO BEGGED HIM TO CHARGE HIMSELF WITH THE EXECUTION OF IT
4335-15082-0030 ETIENNE NOW CAUSED CRIERS TO PROCLAIM THROUGH THE VILLAGE THAT EVERY ONE SHOULD GET READY TO EMIGRATE IN A FEW DAYS TO THE COUNTRY OF THEIR NEW FRIENDS THE SQUAWS BEGAN THEIR PREPARATIONS AT ONCE AND ALL WAS BUSTLE AND ALACRITY
4335-15082-0031 FOR THE HURONS THEMSELVES WERE NO LESS DECEIVED THAN WERE THE IROQUOIS ENVOYS DURING ONE OR TWO SUCCEEDING DAYS MANY MESSAGES AND VISITS PASSED BETWEEN THE HURONS AND THE IROQUOIS WHOSE CONFIDENCE WAS SUCH THAT
4335-15082-0032 THIRTY SEVEN OF THEIR BEST WARRIORS AT LENGTH CAME OVER IN A BODY TO THE HURON VILLAGE ETIENNE'S TIME HAD COME HE AND THE CHIEFS WHO WERE IN THE SECRET GAVE THE WORD TO THE HURON WARRIORS WHO AT A SIGNAL RAISED THE WAR WHOOP
4335-15082-0033 RUSHED UPON THEIR VISITORS AND CUT THEM TO PIECES ONE OF THEM WHO LINGERED FOR A TIME OWNED BEFORE HE DIED THAT ETIENNE'S SUSPICIONS WERE JUST AND THAT THEY HAD DESIGNED NOTHING LESS THAN THE MASSACRE OR CAPTURE OF ALL THE HURONS
4335-15082-0034 THREE OF THE IROQUOIS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE SLAUGHTER BEGAN HAD RECEIVED FROM ETIENNE A WARNING OF THEIR DANGER IN TIME TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE THE YEAR BEFORE HE HAD BEEN CAPTURED WITH BREBEUF AND LALEMANT AT THE TOWN OF SAINT LOUIS
4335-15082-0035 WITH A BRIEF GLEAM OF JOY BUT IT BEHOOVED THEM TO MAKE A TIMELY RETREAT FROM THEIR ISLAND BEFORE THE IROQUOIS CAME TO EXACT A BLOODY RETRIBUTION TOWARDS SPRING WHILE THE LAKE WAS STILL FROZEN MANY OF THEM ESCAPED ON THE ICE WHILE ANOTHER PARTY AFTERWARDS
4335-15082-0036 FOLLOWED IN CANOES A FEW WHO HAD NEITHER STRENGTH TO WALK NOR CANOES TO TRANSPORT THEM PERFORCE REMAINED BEHIND AND WERE SOON MASSACRED BY THE IROQUOIS THE FUGITIVES DIRECTED THEIR COURSE TO THE GRAND MANITOULIN ISLAND
4335-15082-0037 WHERE THEY REMAINED FOR A SHORT TIME AND THEN TO THE NUMBER OF ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED DESCENDED THE OTTAWA AND REJOINED THEIR COUNTRYMEN WHO HAD GONE TO QUEBEC THE YEAR BEFORE THESE UNITED PARTIES JOINED FROM TIME TO TIME BY A FEW OTHER FUGITIVES
4335-15082-0038 FORMED A SETTLEMENT ON LAND BELONGING TO THE JESUITS NEAR THE SOUTH WESTERN EXTREMITY OF THE ISLE OF ORLEANS IMMEDIATELY BELOW QUEBEC
4335-15082-0039 WITH A CHAPEL AND A SMALL HOUSE FOR THE MISSIONARIES
4335-15082-0040 GRADUALLY THEY RALLIED FROM THEIR DEJECTION AND THE MISSION SETTLEMENT WAS BEGINNING TO WEAR AN APPEARANCE OF THRIFT WHEN IN SIXTEEN FIFTY SIX THE IROQUOIS MADE A DESCENT UPON THEM AND CARRIED OFF A LARGE NUMBER OF CAPTIVES
4335-15082-0041 UNDER THE VERY CANNON OF QUEBEC THE FRENCH NOT DARING TO FIRE UPON THE INVADERS LEST THEY SHOULD TAKE REVENGE UPON THE JESUITS WHO WERE AT THAT TIME IN THEIR COUNTRY
4335-15082-0042 THIS CALAMITY WAS FOUR YEARS AFTER FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER WHEN THE BEST OF THE HURON WARRIORS INCLUDING THEIR LEADER THE CRAFTY AND VALIANT ETIENNE ANNAOTAHA WERE SLAIN
4335-15082-0043 THEY AGAIN CHANGED THEIR ABODE AND UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE JESUITS WHO OWNED THE LAND SETTLED AT OLD LORETTE NINE MILES FROM QUEBEC
4335-15082-0044 WHICH AS ALL THE WORLD KNOWS IS THE HOUSE WHEREIN SAINT JOSEPH DWELT WITH HIS VIRGIN SPOUSE AND WHICH ANGELS BORE THROUGH THE AIR FROM THE HOLY LAND TO ITALY
4335-15082-0045 CHAUMONOT OPENED HIS PLAN TO HIS BROTHER JESUITS WHO WERE DELIGHTED WITH IT AND THE CHAPEL WAS BEGUN AT ONCE NOT WITHOUT THE INTERVENTION OF MIRACLE
4335-15082-0046 IT WAS BUILT OF BRICK LIKE ITS ORIGINAL OF WHICH IT WAS AN EXACT FACSIMILE AND IT STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF A QUADRANGLE THE FOUR SIDES OF WHICH WERE FORMED BY THE BARK DWELLINGS OF THE HURONS RANGED WITH PERFECT ORDER IN STRAIGHT LINES
4335-15082-0047 HITHER CAME MANY PILGRIMS FROM QUEBEC AND MORE DISTANT SETTLEMENTS AND HERE OUR LADY GRANTED TO HER SUPPLIANTS
4335-15082-0048 OR INDIAN LORETTE IT WAS A WILD SPOT COVERED WITH THE PRIMITIVE FOREST AND SEAMED BY A DEEP AND TORTUOUS RAVINE WHERE THE SAINT CHARLES FOAMS
4335-15082-0049 AND WHERE THE SUNLIGHT STRUGGLES THROUGH MATTED BOUGHS OF THE PINE AND FIR TO BASK FOR BRIEF MOMENTS ON THE MOSSY ROCKS OR FLASH ON THE HURRYING WATERS ON A PLATEAU BESIDE THE TORRENT ANOTHER CHAPEL WAS BUILT TO OUR LADY
4335-15082-0050 AND ANOTHER HURON TOWN SPRANG UP AND HERE TO THIS DAY THE TOURIST FINDS THE REMNANT OF A LOST PEOPLE HARMLESS WEAVERS OF BASKETS AND SEWERS OF MOCCASINS
