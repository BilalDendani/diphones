5246-5084-0000 THE CHASE I APPROACHED MY NATIVE NORTH FOR SUCH I ESTEEMED IT WITH THAT ENTHUSIASM WHICH ROMANTIC AND WILD SCENERY INSPIRES IN THE LOVERS OF NATURE NO LONGER INTERRUPTED BY THE BABBLE OF MY COMPANION
5246-5084-0001 I COULD NOW REMARK THE DIFFERENCE WHICH THE COUNTRY EXHIBITED FROM THAT THROUGH WHICH I HAD HITHERTO TRAVELLED THE STREAMS NOW MORE PROPERLY DESERVED THE NAME FOR INSTEAD OF SLUMBERING STAGNANT AMONG REEDS AND WILLOWS
5246-5084-0002 THEY BRAWLED ALONG BENEATH THE SHADE OF NATURAL COPSEWOOD WERE NOW HURRIED DOWN DECLIVITIES AND NOW PURLED MORE LEISURELY BUT STILL IN ACTIVE MOTION THROUGH LITTLE LONELY VALLEYS WHICH OPENING ON THE ROAD FROM TIME TO TIME
5246-5084-0003 SEEMED TO INVITE THE TRAVELLER TO EXPLORE THEIR RECESSES THE CHEVIOTS ROSE BEFORE ME IN FROWNING MAJESTY NOT INDEED WITH THE SUBLIME VARIETY OF ROCK AND CLIFF WHICH CHARACTERIZES MOUNTAINS OF THE PRIMARY CLASS
5246-5084-0004 BUT HUGE ROUND HEADED AND CLOTHED WITH A DARK ROBE OF RUSSET GAINING BY THEIR EXTENT AND DESOLATE APPEARANCE AN INFLUENCE UPON THE IMAGINATION AS A DESERT DISTRICT POSSESSING A CHARACTER OF ITS OWN
5246-5084-0005 THE ABODE OF MY FATHERS WHICH I WAS NOW APPROACHING WAS SITUATED IN A GLEN OR NARROW VALLEY WHICH RAN UP AMONG THOSE HILLS EXTENSIVE ESTATES WHICH ONCE BELONGED TO THE FAMILY OF OSBALDISTONE HAD BEEN LONG DISSIPATED BY THE MISFORTUNES
5246-5084-0006 OR MISCONDUCT OF MY ANCESTORS BUT ENOUGH WAS STILL ATTACHED TO THE OLD MANSION TO GIVE MY UNCLE THE TITLE OF A MAN OF LARGE PROPERTY THIS HE EMPLOYED AS I WAS GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND BY SOME INQUIRIES WHICH I MADE ON THE ROAD
5246-5084-0007 IN MAINTAINING THE PRODIGAL HOSPITALITY OF A NORTHERN SQUIRE OF THE PERIOD WHICH HE DEEMED ESSENTIAL TO HIS FAMILY DIGNITY FROM THE SUMMIT OF AN EMINENCE I HAD ALREADY HAD A DISTANT VIEW OF OSBALDISTONE HALL A LARGE AND ANTIQUATED EDIFICE
5246-5084-0008 PEEPING OUT FROM A DRUIDICAL GROVE OF HUGE OAKS AND I WAS DIRECTING MY COURSE TOWARDS IT AS STRAIGHTLY AND AS SPEEDILY AS THE WINDINGS OF A VERY INDIFFERENT ROAD WOULD PERMIT WHEN MY HORSE TIRED AS HE WAS
5246-5084-0009 CHEERED BY THE OCCASIONAL BURSTS OF A FRENCH HORN WHICH IN THOSE DAYS WAS A CONSTANT ACCOMPANIMENT TO THE CHASE I MADE NO DOUBT THAT THE PACK WAS MY UNCLE'S AND DREW UP MY HORSE WITH THE PURPOSE OF SUFFERING THE HUNTERS TO PASS WITHOUT NOTICE
5246-5084-0010 AWARE THAT A HUNTING FIELD WAS NOT THE PROPER SCENE TO INTRODUCE MYSELF TO A KEEN SPORTSMAN AND DETERMINED WHEN THEY HAD PASSED ON TO PROCEED TO THE MANSION HOUSE AT MY OWN PACE AND THERE TO AWAIT THE RETURN OF THE PROPRIETOR FROM HIS SPORT
5246-5084-0011 I PAUSED THEREFORE ON A RISING GROUND AND NOT UNMOVED BY THE SENSE OF INTEREST WHICH THAT SPECIES OF SILVAN SPORT IS SO MUCH CALCULATED TO INSPIRE
5246-5084-0012 ALTHOUGH MY MIND WAS NOT AT THE MOMENT VERY ACCESSIBLE TO IMPRESSIONS OF THIS NATURE I EXPECTED WITH SOME EAGERNESS THE APPEARANCE OF THE HUNTSMEN THE FOX HARD RUN AND NEARLY SPENT
5246-5084-0013 FIRST MADE HIS APPEARANCE FROM THE COPSE WHICH CLOTHED THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE VALLEY HIS DROOPING BRUSH HIS SOILED APPEARANCE AND JADED TROT PROCLAIMED HIS FATE IMPENDING
5246-5084-0014 AND THE CARRION CROW WHICH HOVERED OVER HIM ALREADY CONSIDERED POOR REYNARD AS SOON TO BE HIS PREY HE CROSSED THE STREAM WHICH DIVIDES THE LITTLE VALLEY AND WAS DRAGGING HIMSELF UP A RAVINE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF ITS WILD BANKS
5246-5084-0015 WHEN THE HEADMOST HOUNDS FOLLOWED BY THE REST OF THE PACK IN FULL CRY BURST FROM THE COPPICE FOLLOWED BY THE HUNTSMAN AND THREE OR FOUR RIDERS
5246-5084-0016 THE DOGS PURSUED THE TRACE OF REYNARD WITH UNERRING INSTINCT AND THE HUNTERS FOLLOWED WITH RECKLESS HASTE REGARDLESS OF THE BROKEN AND DIFFICULT NATURE OF THE GROUND THEY WERE TALL STOUT YOUNG MEN WELL MOUNTED
5246-5084-0017 AND DRESSED IN GREEN AND RED THE UNIFORM OF A SPORTING ASSOCIATION FORMED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF OLD SIR HILDEBRAND OSBALDISTONE MY COUSINS THOUGHT I AS THEY SWEPT PAST ME THE NEXT REFLECTION WAS
5246-5084-0018 WHAT IS MY RECEPTION LIKELY TO BE AMONG THESE WORTHY SUCCESSORS OF NIMROD AND HOW IMPROBABLE IS IT THAT I KNOWING LITTLE OR NOTHING OF RURAL SPORTS SHALL FIND MYSELF AT EASE OR HAPPY IN MY UNCLE'S FAMILY
5246-5084-0019 A VISION THAT PASSED ME INTERRUPTED THESE REFLECTIONS IT WAS A YOUNG LADY THE LOVELINESS OF WHOSE VERY STRIKING FEATURES WAS ENHANCED BY THE ANIMATION OF THE CHASE AND THE GLOW OF THE EXERCISE
5246-5084-0020 MOUNTED ON A BEAUTIFUL HORSE JET BLACK UNLESS WHERE HE WAS FLECKED BY SPOTS OF THE SNOW WHITE FOAM WHICH EMBOSSED HIS BRIDLE SHE WORE WHAT WAS THEN SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL A COAT VEST AND HAT
5246-5084-0021 RESEMBLING THOSE OF A MAN WHICH FASHION HAS SINCE CALLED A RIDING HABIT THE MODE HAD BEEN INTRODUCED WHILE I WAS IN FRANCE AND WAS PERFECTLY NEW TO ME HER LONG BLACK HAIR STREAMED ON THE BREEZE
5246-5084-0022 HAVING IN THE HURRY OF THE CHASE ESCAPED FROM THE RIBBON WHICH BOUND IT SOME VERY BROKEN GROUND THROUGH WHICH SHE GUIDED HER HORSE WITH THE MOST ADMIRABLE ADDRESS AND PRESENCE OF MIND RETARDED HER COURSE AND BROUGHT HER CLOSER TO ME THAN ANY OF THE OTHER RIDERS HAD PASSED
5246-5084-0023 I HAD THEREFORE A FULL VIEW OF HER UNCOMMONLY FINE FACE AND PERSON TO WHICH AN INEXPRESSIBLE CHARM WAS ADDED BY THE WILD GAIETY OF THE SCENE AND THE ROMANCE OF HER SINGULAR DRESS AND UNEXPECTED APPEARANCE
5246-5084-0024 AS SHE PASSED ME HER HORSE MADE IN HIS IMPETUOSITY AN IRREGULAR MOVEMENT JUST WHILE COMING ONCE MORE UPON OPEN GROUND SHE WAS AGAIN PUTTING HIM TO HIS SPEED IT SERVED AS AN APOLOGY FOR ME TO RIDE CLOSE UP TO HER
5246-5084-0025 AS IF TO HER ASSISTANCE THERE WAS HOWEVER NO CAUSE FOR ALARM IT WAS NOT A STUMBLE NOR A FALSE STEP AND IF IT HAD THE FAIR AMAZON HAD TOO MUCH SELF POSSESSION TO HAVE BEEN DERANGED BY IT SHE THANKED MY GOOD INTENTIONS HOWEVER BY A SMILE
5246-5084-0026 AND I FELT ENCOURAGED TO PUT MY HORSE TO THE SAME PACE AND TO KEEP IN HER IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD THE CLAMOUR OF WHOOP DEAD DEAD AND THE CORRESPONDING FLOURISH OF THE FRENCH HORN SOON ANNOUNCED TO US THAT THERE WAS NO MORE OCCASION FOR HASTE SINCE THE CHASE
5246-5084-0027 WAS AT A CLOSE ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WHOM WE HAD SEEN APPROACHED US WAVING THE BRUSH OF THE FOX IN TRIUMPH AS IF TO UPBRAID MY FAIR COMPANION I SEE SHE REPLIED I SEE BUT MAKE NO NOISE ABOUT IT IF PHOEBE SHE SAID
5246-5084-0028 PATTING THE NECK OF THE BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL ON WHICH SHE RODE HAD NOT GOT AMONG THE CLIFFS YOU WOULD HAVE HAD LITTLE CAUSE FOR BOASTING THEY MET AS SHE SPOKE
5246-5084-0029 AND WITH A SORT OF SHEEPISH SULLENNESS SHE INSTANTLY TURNED HER HORSE'S HEAD TOWARDS ME SAYING WELL WELL THORNIE IF YOU WON'T I MUST THAT'S ALL SIR SHE CONTINUED ADDRESSING ME
5246-5084-0030 I HAVE BEEN ENDEAVOURING TO PERSUADE THIS CULTIVATED YOUNG GENTLEMAN TO MAKE INQUIRY OF YOU WHETHER IN THE COURSE OF YOUR TRAVELS IN THESE PARTS YOU HAVE HEARD ANYTHING OF A FRIEND OF OURS ONE MISTER FRANCIS OSBALDISTONE
5246-5084-0031 WHO HAS BEEN FOR SOME DAYS EXPECTED AT OSBALDISTONE HALL I WAS TOO HAPPY TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF TO BE THE PARTY INQUIRED AFTER AND TO EXPRESS MY THANKS FOR THE OBLIGING INQUIRIES OF THE YOUNG LADY IN THAT CASE SIR SHE REJOINED
5246-5084-0032 AS MY KINSMAN'S POLITENESS SEEMS TO BE STILL SLUMBERING YOU WILL PERMIT ME THOUGH I SUPPOSE IT IS HIGHLY IMPROPER TO STAND MISTRESS OF CEREMONIES AND TO PRESENT TO YOU YOUNG SQUIRE THORNCLIFF OSBALDISTONE YOUR COUSIN
5246-5084-0033 AND DIE VERNON WHO HAS ALSO THE HONOUR TO BE YOUR ACCOMPLISHED COUSIN'S POOR KINSWOMAN THERE WAS A MIXTURE OF BOLDNESS SATIRE AND SIMPLICITY IN THE MANNER IN WHICH MISS VERNON PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS
5246-5084-0034 MY KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE WAS SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE ME TO TAKE UP A CORRESPONDING TONE AS I EXPRESSED MY GRATITUDE TO HER FOR HER CONDESCENSION AND MY EXTREME PLEASURE AT HAVING MET WITH THEM TO SAY THE TRUTH THE COMPLIMENT WAS SO EXPRESSED
5246-5084-0035 THAT THE LADY MIGHT EASILY APPROPRIATE THE GREATER SHARE OF IT FOR THORNCLIFF SEEMED AN ARRANT COUNTRY BUMPKIN AWKWARD SHY AND SOMEWHAT SULKY WITHAL HE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME HOWEVER
5246-5084-0036 AND THEN INTIMATED HIS INTENTION OF LEAVING ME THAT HE MIGHT HELP THE HUNTSMAN AND HIS BROTHERS TO COUPLE UP THE HOUNDS A PURPOSE WHICH HE RATHER COMMUNICATED BY WAY OF INFORMATION TO MISS VERNON THAN AS APOLOGY TO ME THERE HE GOES SAID THE YOUNG LADY
5246-5084-0037 FOLLOWING HIM WITH EYES IN WHICH DISDAIN WAS ADMIRABLY PAINTED THE PRINCE OF GROOMS AND COCK FIGHTERS AND BLACKGUARD HORSE COURSERS BUT THERE IS NOT ONE OF THEM TO MEND ANOTHER HAVE YOU READ MARKHAM SAID MISS VERNON READ WHOM MA'AM
5246-5084-0038 I DO NOT EVEN REMEMBER THE AUTHOR'S NAME O LUD ON WHAT A STRAND ARE YOU WRECKED REPLIED THE YOUNG LADY A POOR FORLORN AND IGNORANT STRANGER UNACQUAINTED WITH THE VERY ALCORAN OF THE SAVAGE TRIBE WHOM YOU ARE COME TO RESIDE AMONG NEVER TO HAVE HEARD OF MARKHAM
5246-5084-0039 THEN I FEAR YOU ARE EQUALLY A STRANGER TO THE MORE MODERN NAMES OF GIBSON AND BARTLETT I AM INDEED MISS VERNON AND DO YOU NOT BLUSH TO OWN IT SAID MISS VERNON WHY WE MUST FORSWEAR YOUR ALLIANCE
5246-5084-0040 THEN I SUPPOSE YOU CAN NEITHER GIVE A BALL NOR A MASH NOR A HORN
5246-5084-0041 OR TO MY GROOM INCREDIBLE CARELESSNESS AND YOU CANNOT SHOE A HORSE OR CUT HIS MANE AND TAIL OR WORM A DOG OR CROP HIS EARS OR CUT HIS DEW CLAWS OR RECLAIM A HAWK OR GIVE HIM HIS CASTING STONES
5246-5084-0042 OR DIRECT HIS DIET WHEN HE IS SEALED OR TO SUM UP MY INSIGNIFICANCE IN ONE WORD REPLIED I I AM PROFOUNDLY IGNORANT IN ALL THESE RURAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS THEN IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN MISTER FRANCIS OSBALDISTONE
5246-5084-0043 WHAT CAN YOU DO VERY LITTLE TO THE PURPOSE MISS VERNON SOMETHING HOWEVER I CAN PRETEND TO WHEN MY GROOM HAS DRESSED MY HORSE I CAN RIDE HIM AND WHEN MY HAWK IS IN THE FIELD I CAN FLY HIM CAN YOU DO THIS
5246-5084-0044 SAID THE YOUNG LADY PUTTING HER HORSE TO A CANTER THERE WAS A SORT OF RUDE OVERGROWN FENCE CROSSED THE PATH BEFORE US WITH A GATE COMPOSED OF PIECES OF WOOD ROUGH FROM THE FOREST I WAS ABOUT TO MOVE FORWARD TO OPEN IT
5246-5084-0045 WHEN MISS VERNON CLEARED THE OBSTRUCTION AT A FLYING LEAP I WAS BOUND IN POINT OF HONOUR TO FOLLOW AND WAS IN A MOMENT AGAIN AT HER SIDE THERE ARE HOPES OF YOU YET SHE SAID I WAS AFRAID YOU HAD BEEN A VERY DEGENERATE OSBALDISTONE
5246-5084-0046 BUT WHAT ON EARTH BRINGS YOU TO CUB CASTLE FOR SO THE NEIGHBOURS HAVE CHRISTENED THIS HUNTING HALL OF OURS YOU MIGHT HAVE STAYED AWAY I SUPPOSE IF YOU WOULD
