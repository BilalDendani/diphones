1767-142932-0000 A NEW FRIEND AND AN OLD ONE
1767-142932-0001 SOMETIMES CALLED REDBIRD HE HAD COME UP TO THE OLD ORCHARD FOR HIS USUAL MORNING VISIT AND JUST AS HE HOPPED OVER THE OLD STONE WALL HE HEARD A BEAUTIFUL CLEAR LOUD WHISTLE
1767-142932-0002 PETER STOPPED SHORT WITH A LITTLE GASP OF SHEER ASTONISHMENT AND DELIGHT THEN HE RUBBED HIS EYES AND LOOKED AGAIN HE COULDN'T QUITE BELIEVE THAT HE SAW WHAT HE THOUGHT HE SAW HE HADN'T SUPPOSED THAT ANY ONE EVEN AMONG THE FEATHERED FOLKS
1767-142932-0003 COULD BE QUITE SO BEAUTIFUL THE STRANGER WAS DRESSED ALL IN RED EXCEPTING A LITTLE BLACK AROUND THE BASE OF HIS BILL EVEN HIS BILL WAS RED HE WORE A BEAUTIFUL RED CREST WHICH MADE HIM STILL MORE DISTINGUISHED LOOKING AND HOW HE COULD SING
1767-142932-0004 HAVE THE POOREST SONGS BUT THIS STRANGER'S SONG WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS HIS COAT
1767-142932-0005 OF COURSE HE LOST NO TIME IN HUNTING UP JENNY WREN WHO IS IT JENNY WHO IS THAT BEAUTIFUL STRANGER WITH SUCH A LOVELY SONG CRIED PETER AS SOON AS HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF JENNY IT'S GLORY THE CARDINAL REPLIED JENNY WREN PROMPTLY ISN'T HE THE LOVELIEST THING YOU'VE EVER SEEN
1767-142932-0006 I DO HOPE HE IS GOING TO STAY HERE AS I SAID BEFORE I DON'T OFTEN ENVY ANY ONE'S FINE CLOTHES BUT WHEN I SEE GLORY I'M SOMETIMES TEMPTED TO BE ENVIOUS IF I WERE MISSUS CARDINAL I'M AFRAID I SHOULD BE JEALOUS
1767-142932-0007 DID YOU EVER SEE SUCH A DIFFERENCE PETER LOOKED EAGERLY INSTEAD OF THE GLORIOUS RED OF GLORY MISSUS CARDINAL WORE A VERY DULL DRESS
1767-142932-0008 HER THROAT WAS A GRAYISH BLACK HER BREAST WAS A DULL BUFF WITH A FAINT TINGE OF RED
1767-142932-0009 ALTOGETHER SHE WAS VERY SOBERLY DRESSED BUT A TRIM NEAT LOOKING LITTLE PERSON BUT IF SHE WASN'T HANDSOMELY DRESSED SHE COULD SING IN FACT SHE WAS ALMOST AS GOOD A SINGER AS HER HANDSOME HUSBAND
1767-142932-0010 I'VE NOTICED SAID PETER THAT PEOPLE WITH FINE CLOTHES SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME THINKING ABOUT THEM AND ARE OF VERY LITTLE USE WHEN IT COMES TO REAL WORK IN LIFE WELL YOU NEEDN'T THINK THAT OF GLORY DECLARED JENNY IN HER VIGOROUS WAY HE'S JUST AS FINE
1767-142932-0011 AS HE IS HANDSOME HE'S A MODEL HUSBAND IF THEY MAKE THEIR HOME AROUND HERE YOU'LL FIND HIM
1767-142932-0012 SOMETIMES THEY RAISE TWO FAMILIES WHEN THEY DO THAT GLORY TAKES CHARGE OF THE FIRST LOT OF YOUNGSTERS AS SOON AS THEY ARE ABLE TO LEAVE THE NEST SO THAT MISSUS CARDINAL HAS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT WHILE SHE IS SITTING ON THE SECOND LOT OF EGGS HE FUSSES OVER THEM
1767-142932-0013 AS IF THEY WERE THE ONLY CHILDREN IN THE WORLD EVERYBODY LOVES GLORY EXCUSE ME PETER I'M GOING OVER TO FIND OUT IF THEY ARE REALLY GOING TO STAY WHEN JENNY RETURNED SHE WAS SO EXCITED SHE COULDN'T KEEP STILL A MINUTE
1767-142932-0014 THEY LIKE HERE PETER SHE CRIED THEY LIKE HERE SO MUCH THAT IF THEY CAN FIND A PLACE TO SUIT THEM FOR A NEST THEY'RE GOING TO STAY
1767-142932-0015 NEIGHBORHOOD MISTER AND MISSUS CARDINAL WHISTLED AND SANG AS IF THEIR HEARTS WERE BURSTING WITH JOY AND PETER SAT AROUND LISTENING AS IF HE HAD NOTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD TO DO
1767-142932-0016 VERY FOND KITTY THE CATBIRD IN CONTRAST WITH GLORY KITTY SEEMED A REGULAR LITTLE QUAKER FOR HE WAS DRESSED ALMOST WHOLLY IN GRAY A RATHER DARK SLATY GRAY THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND TAIL WERE BLACK
1767-142932-0017 HE WAS A LITTLE SMALLER THAN WELCOME ROBIN THERE WAS NO DANGER OF MISTAKING HIM FOR ANYBODY ELSE FOR THERE IS NO ONE DRESSED AT ALL LIKE HIM PETER FORGOT ALL ABOUT GLORY IN HIS PLEASURE AT DISCOVERING THE RETURNED KITTY
1767-142932-0018 AND HURRIED OVER TO WELCOME HIM KITTY HAD DISAPPEARED AMONG THE BUSHES ALONG THE OLD STONE WALL BUT PETER HAD NO TROUBLE IN FINDING HIM BY THE QUEER CRIES HE WAS UTTERING WHICH WERE VERY LIKE THE MEOW OF BLACK PUSSY THE CAT THEY WERE VERY HARSH AND UNPLEASANT AND PETER UNDERSTOOD PERFECTLY
1767-142932-0019 HE DID NOT HURRY IN AMONG THE BUSHES AT ONCE BUT WAITED EXPECTANTLY IN A FEW MINUTES THE HARSH CRIES CEASED AND THEN THERE CAME FROM THE VERY SAME PLACE A SONG WHICH SEEMED TO BE MADE UP OF PARTS OF THE SONGS OF ALL THE OTHER BIRDS OF THE OLD ORCHARD
1767-142932-0020 IT WAS NOT LOUD BUT IT WAS CHARMING IT CONTAINED THE CLEAR WHISTLE OF GLORY AND THERE WAS EVEN THE TINKLE OF LITTLE FRIEND THE SONG SPARROW THE NOTES OF OTHER FRIENDS WERE IN THAT SONG
1767-142932-0021 AND WITH THEM WERE NOTES OF SOUTHERN BIRDS WHOSE SONGS KITTY HAD LEARNED WHILE SPENDING THE WINTER IN THE SOUTH THEN THERE WERE NOTES ALL HIS OWN PETER LISTENED UNTIL THE SONG ENDED THEN SCAMPERED IN AMONG THE BUSHES AT ONCE THOSE HARSH CRIES BROKE OUT AGAIN
1767-142932-0022 BUT THAT WAS JUST KITTY'S WAY HE IS SIMPLY BRIMMING OVER WITH FUN AND MISCHIEF AND DELIGHTS TO PRETEND WHEN PETER FOUND HIM HE WAS SITTING WITH ALL HIS FEATHERS PUFFED OUT UNTIL HE LOOKED ALMOST LIKE A BALL WITH A HEAD AND TAIL HE LOOKED POSITIVELY SLEEPY
1767-142932-0023 THEN AS HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF PETER HE DREW THOSE FEATHERS DOWN TIGHT COCKED HIS TAIL UP AFTER THE MANNER OF JENNY WREN AND WAS AS SLIM AND TRIM LOOKING AS ANY BIRD OF PETER'S ACQUAINTANCE HE DIDN'T LOOK AT ALL LIKE THE SAME BIRD OF THE MOMENT BEFORE
1767-142932-0024 IT HUNG STRAIGHT DOWN HE DROPPED HIS WINGS AND ALL IN A SECOND MADE HIMSELF LOOK FAIRLY DISREPUTABLE BUT ALL THE TIME HIS EYES WERE TWINKLING AND SNAPPING AND PETER KNEW THAT THESE CHANGES IN APPEARANCE WERE MADE OUT OF PURE FUN AND MISCHIEF
1767-142932-0025 I'VE BEEN WONDERING IF YOU WERE COMING HACK CRIED PETER I DON'T KNOW OF ANY ONE OF MY FEATHERED FRIENDS I WOULD MISS SO MUCH AS YOU THANK YOU RESPONDED KITTY IT'S VERY NICE OF YOU TO SAY THAT PETER
1767-142932-0026 IF YOU ARE GLAD TO SEE ME I AM STILL MORE GLAD TO GET BACK DID YOU PASS A PLEASANT WINTER DOWN SOUTH ASKED PETER FAIRLY SO FAIRLY SO REPLIED KITTY BY THE WAY PETER I PICKED UP SOME NEW SONGS DOWN THERE
1767-142932-0027 BUT I DON'T THINK YOU NEED ANY NEW SONGS I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH A FELLOW FOR PICKING UP OTHER PEOPLE'S SONGS EXCEPTING MOCKER THE MOCKINGBIRD
1767-142932-0028 SAID HE I'M PRETTY GOOD AT IMITATING OTHERS BUT MOCKER IS BETTER I'M HOPING THAT IF I PRACTICE ENOUGH SOME DAY I CAN BE AS GOOD I SAW A LOT OF HIM IN THE SOUTH AND HE CERTAINLY IS CLEVER HUH YOU DON'T NEED TO ENVY HIM RETORTED PETER
1767-142932-0029 YOU ARE SOME IMITATOR YOURSELF HOW ABOUT THOSE NEW NOTES YOU GOT WHEN YOU WERE IN THE SOUTH
1767-142932-0030 IT DIDN'T SEEM AS IF SO MANY NOTES COULD COME FROM ONE THROAT
