6051-54419-0000 ITS ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES ITS BEAUTY AND ITS UGLINESS ITS MORALITY AND IMMORALITY SHE HAD SOMEWHAT RECEDED FROM HER FIRST POSITION THAT IT WAS BETTER BEING HERE IN THE GREAT STRANGE CITY THAN BEING AT HOME WHERE THE VERY STREETS SHAMED THEM
6051-54419-0001 SHE HAD NOT LIKED THE WAY THAT THEIR FELLOW LODGER LOOKED AT KITTY IT WAS BOLD TO SAY THE LEAST SHE WAS NOT PLEASED EITHER WITH THEIR NEW ACQUAINTANCE'S FAMILIARITY AND YET HE HAD SAID NO MORE THAN SOME STRANGER
6051-54419-0002 IF THERE COULD BE SUCH A STRANGER WOULD HAVE SAID DOWN HOME THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE HOWEVER WHICH SHE RECOGNISED THOMAS WAS NOT THE PROVINCIAL WHO PUTS EVERY ONE ON A PAR WITH HIMSELF NOR WAS HE THE METROPOLITAN WHO COMPLACENTLY PATRONISES THE WHOLE WORLD
6051-54419-0003 MISSUS JONES ASSURANCE AS TO HER GUEST'S FINE QUALITIES DID NOT DO ALL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO REASSURE MISSUS HAMILTON IN THE FACE OF THE DIFFICULTIES
6051-54419-0004 SHE COULD NOT HOWEVER LAY HER FINGER ON ANY PARTICULAR POINT THAT WOULD GIVE HER THE REASON FOR REJECTING HIS FRIENDLY ADVANCES SHE GOT READY THE NEXT EVENING TO GO TO THE THEATRE WITH THE REST MISTER THOMAS AT ONCE POSSESSED HIMSELF OF KITTY
6051-54419-0005 AND WALKED ON AHEAD LEAVING JOE TO ACCOMPANY HIS MOTHER AND MISSUS JONES AN ARRANGEMENT BY THE WAY NOT ALTOGETHER TO THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN'S TASTE
6051-54419-0006 AT THE DOOR OF THE THEATRE THEY HAD TO RUN THE GANTLET OF A DOZEN PAIRS OF EYES
6051-54419-0007 I WONDER WHO THAT LITTLE LIGHT GIRL IS THAT THOMAS IS WITH TO NIGHT HE S A HOT ONE FOR YOU MISSUS HAMILTON HAD BEEN IN A THEATRE BUT ONCE BEFORE IN HER LIFE AND JOE AND KIT BUT A FEW TIMES OFTENER
6051-54419-0008 ON THOSE OCCASIONS THEY HAD SAT FAR UP IN THE PEANUT GALLERY IN THE PLACE RESERVED FOR PEOPLE OF COLOUR THIS WAS NOT A PLEASANT CLEANLY NOR BEAUTIFUL LOCALITY AND BY CONTRAST WITH IT EVEN THE GARISHNESS OF THE CHEAP NEW YORK THEATRE SEEMED FINE AND GLORIOUS
6051-54419-0009 THEY HAD GOOD SEATS IN THE FIRST BALCONY AND HERE THEIR GUIDE HAD SHOWN HIS MANAGERIAL ABILITY AGAIN FOR HE HAD FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE OR SAID SO TO GET ALL THE SEATS TOGETHER SO THAT HE AND THE GIRL WERE IN THE ROW IN FRONT AND TO ONE SIDE OF WHERE THE REST SAT
6051-54419-0010 KITTY DID NOT LIKE THE ARRANGEMENT AND INNOCENTLY SUGGESTED THAT HER BROTHER TAKE HER SEAT WHILE SHE WENT BACK TO HER MOTHER
6051-54419-0011 SHE COULD NOT URGE THEM AGAIN
6051-54419-0012 WITHOUT ANY FEELING OF ITS UGLINESS SHE LOOKED AT THE CURTAIN AS AT A DOOR THAT SHOULD PRESENTLY OPEN BETWEEN HER AND A HOUSE OF WONDERS SHE LOOKED AT IT WITH THE FASCINATION THAT ONE ALWAYS EXPERIENCES FOR WHAT EITHER BRINGS NEAR OR WITHHOLDS THE UNKNOWN AS FOR JOE
6051-54419-0013 HE WAS NOT BOTHERED BY THE MYSTERY OR THE GLAMOUR OF THINGS BUT HE HAD SUDDENLY RAISED HIMSELF IN HIS OWN ESTIMATION
6051-54419-0014 OF COURSE HE WENT HOT AND COLD BY TURNS AND THE SWEAT BROKE OUT ON HIS BROW BUT INSTANTLY HE BEGAN TO SWELL HE HAD MADE A DECIDED ADVANCE IN KNOWLEDGE AND HE SWELLED WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ALREADY HE WAS COMING TO BE A MAN OF THE WORLD
6051-54419-0015 HE LOOKED WITH A NEW FEELING AT THE SWAGGERING SPORTY YOUNG NEGROES HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS THEM WAS NOT ONE OF HUMBLE SELF DEPRECIATION ANY MORE SINCE LAST NIGHT HE HAD GROWN AND FELT THAT HE MIGHT THAT HE WOULD BE LIKE THEM AND IT PUT A SORT OF CHUCKLING GLEE INTO HIS HEART
6051-54419-0016 DOWN HOME HE HAD SHAVED THE WILD YOUNG BUCKS OF THE TOWN AND WHILE DOING IT DRUNK IN EAGERLY THEIR UNGUARDED NARRATIONS OF THEIR GAY EXPLOITS
6051-54419-0017 THAT MADE HIM SEE EVERYTHING WRONG AS HE SAT THERE TO NIGHT HE GAVE TO ALL HE SAW A WRONG VALUE AND UPON IT BASED HIS IGNORANT DESIRES WHEN THE MEN OF THE ORCHESTRA FILED IN AND BEGAN TUNING THEIR INSTRUMENTS
6051-54419-0018 IT WAS THE SIGNAL FOR AN INFLUX OF LOITERERS FROM THE DOOR
6051-54419-0019 AND BECAUSE MEMBERS OF THEIR OWN RACE WERE GIVING THE PERFORMANCE THEY SEEMED TO TAKE A PROPRIETARY INTEREST IN IT ALL THEY DISCUSSED ITS MERITS AND DEMERITS AS THEY WALKED DOWN THE AISLE IN MUCH THE SAME TONE THAT THE OWNERS WOULD HAVE USED HAD THEY BEEN WONDERING WHETHER THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS GOING TO PLEASE THE PEOPLE OR NOT
6051-54419-0020 THEN THE CURTAIN WENT UP ON A SCENE OF BEAUTY
6051-54419-0021 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE WHO LOOKED LIKE A FADED KID GLOVE THE MEN DISCARDED THE GREASE PAINT BUT THE WOMEN UNDER THEIR MAKE UPS RANGED FROM PURE WHITE PALE YELLOW
6051-54419-0022 BUT THEY COULD SING AND THEY DID SING WITH THEIR VOICES THEIR BODIES THEIR SOULS
6051-54419-0023 AND THEY GAVE ALMOST A SEMBLANCE OF DIGNITY TO THE TAWDRY MUSIC AND INANE WORDS
6051-54419-0024 BUT TAKE THE SAME CHEESE CLOTH PUT A LITTLE WATER STARCH INTO IT AND PUT IT ON THE STAGE AND SHE COULD SEE ONLY CHIFFON SHE TURNED AROUND AND NODDED DELIGHTEDLY AT HER BROTHER BUT HE DID NOT SEE HER HE WAS LOST TRANSFIXED
6051-54419-0025 HIS SOUL WAS FLOATING ON A SEA OF SENSE HE HAD EYES AND EARS AND THOUGHTS ONLY FOR THE STAGE HIS NERVES TINGLED AND HIS HANDS TWITCHED ONLY TO KNOW ONE OF THOSE RADIANT CREATURES TO HAVE HER SPEAK TO HIM SMILE AT HIM IF EVER A MAN WAS INTOXICATED JOE WAS
6051-54419-0026 MISSUS HAMILTON WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN SHAME AT THE CLOTHES OF SOME OF THE WOMEN AND DELIGHT WITH THE MUSIC HER COMPANION WAS BUSY POINTING OUT WHO THIS AND THAT ACTRESS WAS AND GIVING JELLY LIKE APPRECIATION TO THE DOINGS ON THE STAGE
6051-54419-0027 MISTER THOMAS WAS THE ONLY COOL ONE IN THE PARTY HE WAS QUIETLY TAKING STOCK OF HIS YOUNG COMPANION OF HER INNOCENCE AND CHARM SHE WAS A PRETTY GIRL LITTLE AND DAINTY BUT WELL DEVELOPED FOR HER AGE HER HAIR WAS VERY BLACK AND WAVY
6051-54419-0028 AND SOME STRAIN OF THE SOUTH'S CHIVALRIC BLOOD WHICH IS SO CURIOUSLY MINGLED WITH THE AFRICAN IN THE VEINS OF MOST COLOURED PEOPLE HAD TINGED HER SKIN TO AN OLIVE HUE
6051-54419-0029 HIS VOICE WAS VERY CONFIDENTIAL AND HIS LIPS NEAR HER EAR BUT SHE DID NOT NOTICE OH YES SHE ANSWERED THIS IS GRAND HOW I D LIKE TO BE AN ACTRESS AND BE UP THERE MAYBE YOU WILL SOME DAY OH NO I M NOT SMART ENOUGH
6051-54419-0030 WE LL SEE HE SAID WISELY I KNOW A THING OR TWO BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND ACTS A NUMBER OF THOMAS'S FRIENDS STROLLED UP TO WHERE HE SAT AND BEGAN TALKING
6051-54419-0031 THEY TREATED HER WITH A HALF COURTEOUS FAMILIARITY THAT MADE HER BLUSH HER MOTHER WAS NOT PLEASED WITH THE MANY ACQUAINTANCES THAT HER DAUGHTER WAS MAKING
6051-54419-0032 JOE LOOKED AT THEM HUNGRILY BUT THE MAN IN FRONT WITH HIS SISTER DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO INCLUDE THE BROTHER OR THE REST OF THE PARTY IN HIS MISCELLANEOUS INTRODUCTIONS ONE BRIEF BIT OF CONVERSATION WHICH THE MOTHER OVERHEARD ESPECIALLY TROUBLED HER
6051-54419-0033 NOT GOING OUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO ASKED ONE OF THE MEN AS HE WAS TURNING AWAY FROM THOMAS
6051-54419-0034 WHENEVER YOU CAN KEEP OLD BILL FROM GOIN OUT AN LUSHIN BETWEEN ACTS SAY YOU GOT A GOOD THING PUSH IT ALONG THE GIRL'S MOTHER HALF ROSE BUT SHE RESUMED HER SEAT FOR THE MAN WAS GOING AWAY
6051-54419-0035 HER MIND WAS NOT QUIET AGAIN HOWEVER UNTIL THE PEOPLE WERE ALL IN THEIR SEATS AND THE CURTAIN HAD GONE UP ON THE SECOND ACT AT FIRST SHE WAS SURPRISED AT THE ENTHUSIASM OVER JUST SUCH DANCING AS SHE COULD SEE ANY DAY FROM THE LOAFERS ON THE STREET CORNERS DOWN HOME
6051-54419-0036 AND THEN LIKE A GOOD SENSIBLE HUMBLE WOMAN
6051-54419-0037 SO SHE LAUGHED AND APPLAUDED WITH THE REST ALL THE WHILE TRYING TO QUIET SOMETHING THAT WAS TUGGING AT HER AWAY DOWN IN HER HEART WHEN THE PERFORMANCE WAS OVER SHE FORCED HER WAY TO KITTY'S SIDE
6051-54419-0038 WHERE SHE REMAINED IN SPITE OF ALL THOMAS'S PALPABLE EFFORTS TO GET HER AWAY FINALLY HE PROPOSED THAT THEY ALL GO TO SUPPER AT ONE OF THE COLOURED CAFES
