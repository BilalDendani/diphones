7981-112061-0000 DURING THE LAST DAYS OF THE KING'S LIFE VINCENT NEVER LEFT HIM
7981-112061-0001 HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE QUEEN WAS GROWING DAILY BUT IT WAS NOT YET STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERRIDE ALL HER SCRUPLES SHE WAS A GOOD NATURED WOMAN QUITE READY TO DO RIGHT WHEN IT WAS NOT TOO INCONVENIENT AND IT WAS CLEAR TO HER THAT OF LATE YEARS
7981-112061-0002 BISHOPRICS AND ABBEYS HAD BEEN TOO OFTEN GIVEN TO MOST UNWORTHY PERSONS IN FRANCE THE CROWN WAS ALMOST SUPREME IN SUCH MATTERS THE QUEEN THEREFORE DETERMINED TO APPOINT A COUNCIL OF CONSCIENCE CONSISTING OF FIVE MEMBERS
7981-112061-0003 WHOSE BUSINESS IT WOULD BE TO HELP HER WITH ADVICE AS TO ECCLESIASTICAL PREFERMENT MAZARIN'S ASTONISHMENT AND DISGUST WHEN HE HEARD THAT VINCENT DE PAUL HAD BEEN APPOINTED ONE OF THE NUMBER
7981-112061-0004 HE EVEN APPLIED TO THE QUEEN IN PERSON TO BEG HER TO RECONSIDER HER DECISION BUT ANNE WAS OBDURATE AND VINCENT WAS FORCED TO YIELD I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE WORTHY OF COMPASSION OR IN GREATER NEED OF PRAYERS THAN NOW
7981-112061-0005 HE WROTE TO ONE OF HIS FRIENDS AND HIS FOREBODINGS WERE NOT WITHOUT CAUSE IF MAZARIN HAD BEEN UNABLE TO PREVENT THE QUEEN FROM NAMING VINCENT AS ONE OF THE COUNCIL OF CONSCIENCE HE HAD AT LEAST SUCCEEDED IN SECURING HIS OWN NOMINATION
7981-112061-0006 IN THE CAUSE OF HONESTY AND JUSTICE AND FOR THE CHURCH'S WELFARE THE SUPERIOR OF SAINT LAZARE WOULD HAVE TO CONTEND WITH THE FOREMOST STATESMAN OF THE DAY A MINISTER WHO HAD BUILT UP HIS REPUTATION BY TRADING ON THE VICES OF MEN WHO WERE LESS CUNNING THAN HE
7981-112061-0007 WELL DID VINCENT KNOW THAT HE WAS NO MATCH FOR SUCH A DIPLOMATIST BUT HAVING ONCE REALIZED THAT THE DUTY MUST BE UNDERTAKEN HE DETERMINED THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO FLINCHING HE WENT TO COURT IN THE OLD CASSOCK IN WHICH HE WENT ABOUT HIS DAILY WORK
7981-112061-0008 AND WHICH WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE HE HAD YOU ARE NOT GOING TO THE PALACE IN THAT CASSOCK CRIED ONE OF THE MISSION PRIESTS IN CONSTERNATION WHY NOT REPLIED VINCENT QUIETLY IT IS NEITHER STAINED NOR TORN
7981-112061-0009 THE ANSWER WAS NOTEWORTHY FOR A SCRUPULOUS CLEANLINESS WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MAN AS HE PASSED THROUGH THE LONG GALLERIES OF THE LOUVRE
7981-112061-0010 AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF HIS INFLUENCE WERE TO BE PARAMOUNT IN THE COUNCIL NEARLY ALL THE PRIESTS OF PARIS HAD PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS AT THE ORDINATION RETREATS AND THOSE WHO BELONGED TO THE TUESDAY CONFERENCES WERE INTIMATELY KNOWN TO HIM
7981-112061-0011 HE CONSIDERED THAT BISHOPRICS AND ABBEYS WERE USEFUL THINGS TO KEEP IN RESERVE AS BRIBES FOR HIS WAVERING ADHERENTS CERTAIN REFORMS ON WHICH VINCENT INSISTED WERE NOT TO HIS MIND EITHER
7981-112061-0012 VINCENT'S RECEPTION OF THESE PROPOSALS WAS DISCONCERTING GOD FORBID HE WOULD CRY INDIGNANTLY BETTER THAT WE SHOULD ALL GO WITHOUT THE BAREST NECESSITIES OF LIFE SOME WOULD COME WITH A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE QUEEN HERSELF WHICH MADE THINGS DOUBLY EMBARRASSING
7981-112061-0013 BUT IT BECAME QUITE INTOLERABLE WHEN THE SHABBY PRIEST REFUSED TO LISTEN
7981-112061-0014 YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT WAS THE ONLY ANSWER ACCOMPANIED BY A GOOD NATURED SMILE
7981-112061-0015 INSULTED ANOTHER DAY IN PUBLIC BY A MAGISTRATE WHOSE INTERESTS HE HAD REFUSED TO FORWARD
7981-112061-0016 BUT VINCENT'S STRANGEST ADVENTURE WAS WITH A COURT LADY OF HIGH RANK A CERTAIN DUCHESS IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF THE QUEEN CATCHING HER ROYAL MISTRESS IN AN UNGUARDED MOMENT THIS LADY SUCCEEDED IN INDUCING THE QUEEN TO PROMISE THE BISHOPRIC OF
7981-112061-0017 POITIERS TO HER SON A YOUNG MAN OF VERY BAD CHARACTER
7981-112061-0018 BUT MADAME DECLINED CURTLY
7981-112061-0019 SHE WOULD BE OBLIGED IF HE WOULD MAKE OUT THE DEED OF NOMINATION AND TAKE IT TO HER MAJESTY TO SIGN WHAT WAS TO BE DONE TO RESIST WOULD ONLY PROVOKE SUBMISSION SEEMED THE WISEST IF NOT THE ONLY COURSE
7981-112061-0020 AND WAS SHOWN INTO THE QUEEN'S PRESENCE OH SAID HER MAJESTY NOT WITHOUT SOME EMBARRASSMENT
7981-112061-0021 WITHOUT A WORD VINCENT HANDED HER THE ROLL WHICH SHE PROCEEDED TO UNFOLD
7981-112061-0022 THE FORM IS NOT DRAWN UP AT ALL IF YOUR MAJESTY'S MIND IS MADE UP SAID VINCENT QUIETLY I MUST BEG YOU TO WRITE DOWN YOUR WISHES YOURSELF
7981-112061-0023 THEN NOTICING THE HESITATION OF THE QUEEN MADAME HE SAID HOTLY THIS MAN WHOM YOU INTEND TO MAKE A BISHOP SPENDS HIS LIFE IN PUBLIC HOUSES AND IS CARRIED HOME DRUNK EVERY NIGHT
7981-112061-0024 SEIZING A HEAVY STOOL SHE FLUNG IT AT THE HEAD OF THE UNWELCOME MESSENGER WHO BOWED AND RETIRED FROM THE HOUSE WITH THE BLOOD STREAMING FROM A WOUND IN HIS FOREHEAD
7981-112061-0025 JUSTLY INDIGNANT BEGGED TO BE ALLOWED TO GIVE THE GREAT LADY A PIECE OF HIS MIND COME ON SAID VINCENT OUR BUSINESS LIES IN ANOTHER DIRECTION IS IT NOT STRANGE HE SAID SMILING A FEW MOMENTS LATER AS HE TRIED TO STAUNCH THE BLOOD WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF
7981-112061-0026 TO WHAT LENGTHS THE AFFECTION OF A MOTHER FOR HER SON WILL GO
7981-112061-0027 WHOSE SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD CONDUCT BAFFLED THE WILY AND DEFEATED THEIR PLANS BUT AN ATTEMPT TO GET HIM EJECTED FROM THE COUNCIL MET WITH SUCH STORMY OPPOSITION THAT THE PRIME MINISTER DETERMINED TO CHANGE HIS TACTICS
7981-112061-0028 AND THE INTERVALS BETWEEN ITS MEETINGS BECAME LONGER AND LONGER ANNE OF AUSTRIA'S SUDDEN SPURT OF ENERGY SHE WAS A THOROUGHLY INDOLENT WOMAN BY NATURE BEGAN TO DIE OUT AS SHE BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO HER NEW RESPONSIBILITIES
7981-112061-0029 WHO USED THEM AS OF OLD FOR HIS OWN ENDS VINCENT DE PAUL IN BITTER GRIEF AND SORROW WAS FORCED TO WITNESS AN ABUSE THAT HE HAD NO LONGER ANY POWER TO CHECK I FEAR HE WROTE IN AFTER YEARS TO A FRIEND
