3541-174240-0000 ARTISTICALLY THERE IS A GOOD DEAL TO BE SAID FOR THAT OLD GREEK FRIEND OF OURS THE MESSENGER AND I DARE SAY YOU BLAME ME FOR HAVING AS IT WERE MADE YOU AN EYE WITNESS OF THE DEATH OF THE UNDERGRADUATES
3541-174240-0001 SOME ONE WHOM ARE YOU NOT BEGGING THE QUESTION I ADMIT THERE WERE THAT EVENING IN OXFORD MANY PEOPLE WHO WHEN THEY WENT HOME FROM THE RIVER GAVE VIVID REPORTS OF WHAT THEY HAD SEEN
3541-174240-0002 BUT AMONG THEM WAS NONE WHO HAD SEEN MORE THAN A SMALL PORTION OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR CERTAINLY I MIGHT HAVE PIECED TOGETHER A DOZEN OF THE VARIOUS ACCOUNTS AND PUT THEM ALL INTO THE MOUTH OF ONE PERSON
3541-174240-0003 BUT CREDIBILITY IS NOT ENOUGH FOR CLIO'S SERVANT I AIM AT TRUTH AND SO AS I BY MY ZEUS GIVEN INCORPOREITY WAS THE ONE PERSON WHO HAD A GOOD VIEW OF THE SCENE AT LARGE
3541-174240-0004 YOU MUST PARDON ME FOR HAVING WITHHELD THE VEIL OF INDIRECT NARRATION TOO LATE YOU WILL SAY IF I OFFER YOU A MESSENGER NOW BUT IT WAS NOT THUS THAT MISSUS BATCH AND KATIE GREETED CLARENCE WHEN LAMENTABLY SOAKED WITH RAIN
3541-174240-0005 THAT MESSENGER APPEARED ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE KITCHEN KATIE WAS LAYING THE TABLE CLOTH FOR SEVEN O'CLOCK SUPPER NEITHER SHE NOR HER MOTHER WAS CLAIRVOYANTE NEITHER OF THEM KNEW WHAT HAD BEEN HAPPENING BUT AS CLARENCE HAD NOT COME HOME SINCE AFTERNOON SCHOOL
3541-174240-0006 THEY HAD ASSUMED THAT HE WAS AT THE RIVER AND THEY NOW ASSUMED FROM THE LOOK OF HIM THAT SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD BEEN HAPPENING THERE AS TO WHAT THIS WAS THEY WERE NOT QUICKLY ENLIGHTENED OUR OLD GREEK FRIEND AFTER A RUN OF TWENTY MILES
3541-174240-0007 WOULD ALWAYS REEL OFF A ROUND HUNDRED OF GRAPHIC VERSES UNIMPEACHABLE IN SCANSION CLARENCE WAS OF DEGENERATE MOULD HE COLLAPSED ON TO A CHAIR AND SAT THERE GASPING AND HIS RECOVERY WAS RATHER DELAYED THAN HASTENED BY HIS MOTHER
3541-174240-0008 WHO IN HER SOLICITUDE PATTED HIM VIGOROUSLY BETWEEN THE SHOULDERS LET HIM ALONE MOTHER DO CRIED KATIE WRINGING HER HANDS THE DUKE HE'S DROWNED HIMSELF PRESENTLY GASPED THE MESSENGER
3541-174240-0009 BLANK VERSE YES SO FAR AS IT WENT BUT DELIVERED WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST REGARD FOR RHYTHM AND COMPOSED IN STARK DEFIANCE OF THOSE LAWS WHICH SHOULD REGULATE THE BREAKING OF BAD NEWS YOU PLEASE REMEMBER
