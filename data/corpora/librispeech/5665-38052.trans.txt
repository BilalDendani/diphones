5665-38052-0000 THE PROGNOSTICATION MADE BY THE CITIZENS OF PROUTY THAT IT WAS GETTIN READY FOR SOMETHIN SEEMED ABOUT TO BE VERIFIED OUT ON THE SHEEP RANGE TWENTY MILES DISTANT FOR AT FIVE O'CLOCK ONE AFTERNOON
5665-38052-0001 THE WIND STOPPED AS SUDDENLY AS IT HAD ARISEN AND HEAVY SNOW CLOUDS CAME OUT OF THE NORTHEAST WITH INCREDIBLE SWIFTNESS MORMON JOE WALKED TO THE DOOR OF THE COOK TENT AND SWEPT THE DARKENING HILLS WITH ANXIOUS EYES
5665-38052-0002 KATE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BACK LONG BEFORE THIS HE ALWAYS HAD A DREAD OF HER HORSE FALLING ON HER AND HURTING HER TOO BADLY TO GET BACK THAT WAS ABOUT ALL THERE WAS TO FEAR IN SUMMER TIME BUT TO NIGHT THERE WAS THE COMING STORM
5665-38052-0003 KATE'S SENSE OF DIRECTION WAS REMARKABLE BUT THE MOST EXPERIENCED PLAINSMAN WOULD BE APT TO LOSE HIMSELF IN THESE FOOTHILLS WITH THE SNOW FALLING THICK AND THE NIGHT SO BLACK HE COULD NOT SEE HIS HAND BEFORE HIS FACE
5665-38052-0004 MORMON JOE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND TURNED BACK TO HIS TASK OF PEELING POTATOES WHILE HE WORKED HE REPROACHED HIMSELF THAT HE HAD NOT HUNTED THOSE HORSES HIMSELF BUT SHE HAD BEEN SO INSISTENT UPON GOING
5665-38052-0005 SHE DID NOT MIND THE WIND SHE HAD SAID BUT THEN SHE DID NOT MIND ANYTHING WHEN IT CAME TO THAT
5665-38052-0006 AT ANY RATE KATE WAS MORE COMFORTABLE NOW THAN SHE HAD BEEN THE YEAR BEFORE HE SMILED A LITTLE AS HE RECALLED HER DELIGHT IN THE SHEEP WAGON WHICH HE HAD GIVEN HER TO BE HER OWN QUARTERS
5665-38052-0007 BUT HIS CIRCUMSTANCES JUSTIFIED IT HE WAS GETTING AHEAD NOT WITH PHENOMENAL RAPIDITY BUT SATISFACTORILY WITH THE LEASES AND THE LAND HE OWNED HE WAS BUILDING THE FUTURE UPON A SUBSTANTIAL FOUNDATION
5665-38052-0008 A FEW YEARS MORE OF ECONOMY AND ATTENTION TO BUSINESS AND HE COULD GIVE KATE THE ADVANTAGES HE WISHED HE LISTENED GOT UP FROM THE CONDENSED MILK BOX UPON WHICH HE SAT AND WALKED TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT ONCE MORE
5665-38052-0009 HE STRAINED HIS EARS BUT DEATH ITSELF WAS NOT MORE STILL THAN THE OPAQUE NIGHT KATE HAD LEFT IMMEDIATELY AFTER BREAKFAST AND SINCE THE HORSES HAD ONLY A FEW HOURS START AND WOULD PROBABLY FEED AS THEY WENT
5665-38052-0010 SHE HAD EXPECTED TO BE BACK BY NOON KATE WAS EXCEEDINGLY RESOURCEFUL SHE KNEW WHAT TO DO IF CAUGHT OUT HE ASSURED HIMSELF UNLESS SHE HAD BEEN HURT
5665-38052-0011 WHAT WOULD LIFE BE WITHOUT HER NOW WITH THE KNIFE IN HIS HAND HE STOPPED AS HE TURNED INSIDE AND STARED AT THE POTATOES ON THE BOX HE NEVER HAD THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE IT LEFT HIM AGHAST
5665-38052-0012 THE GIRL HAD TWINED HERSELF INTO EVERY FIBER OF HIS NATURE FROM THE TIME SHE HAD COME TO HIM AS A CHILD SHE WAS IDENTIFIED WITH EVERY HOPE HUMPH HE KNEW WELL ENOUGH WHAT THE ANSWER WOULD BE IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO KATE
5665-38052-0013 HE WOULD SHOOT THE CHUTES AGAIN QUICK IT WAS SHE WHO HAD AWAKENED HIS AMBITION AND KEPT HIM TOLERABLY STRAIGHT WITHOUT HER HUMPH HE STOKED THE SHEET IRON CAMP STOVE
5665-38052-0014 PUT THE POTATOES TO BOIL CUT CHOPS ENOUGH FOR TWO
5665-38052-0015 THEN HE SET OUT A TIN OF MOLASSES AND THE SOUR DOUGH BREAD AFTER WHICH THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT WAIT FOR THE POTATOES TO BOIL AND FOR KATE HE WAS TRYING THE POTATOES WITH A FORK WHEN HE RAISED HIS HEAD SHARPLY
5665-38052-0016 HE WAS SURE HE HEARD THE RATTLE OF ROCKS A FAINT WHOOP FOLLOWED THANK GOD HE BREATHED THE EJACULATION FERVENTLY YET HE SAID MERELY AS HE STOOD IN THE ENTRANCE PUFFING HIS PIPE AS SHE RODE UP GOT EM I SEE KATIE
5665-38052-0017 SURE DON'T I ALWAYS GET WHAT I GO AFTER THEN WITH A TIRED LAUGH
5665-38052-0018 HE SMILED QUIZZICALLY I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'D THINK THAT I'LL KNOW BETTER NEXT TIME SHE REPLIED GOOD HUMOREDLY AS SHE SWUNG DOWN WITH OBVIOUS WEARINESS THERE WON'T BE ANY NEXT TIME HE REPLIED ABRUPTLY
5665-38052-0019 AT LEAST NOT AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR OH BUT I'M GLAD I WENT SHE INTERPOSED HASTILY AS MORMON JOE UNWRAPPED THE LEAD ROPE FROM THE SADDLE HORN AND TOOK THE HORSES AWAY TO PICKET HE WONDERED WHAT WONDERFUL ADVENTURE SHE WOULD HAVE TO RELATE
5665-38052-0020 FOR SHE SEEMED ABLE TO EXTRACT ENTERTAINMENT FROM NEARLY ANYTHING BY THE TIME HE RETURNED SHE HAD REMOVED HER HAT GLOVES AND SPURS WASHED HER DUST STREAKED FACE SMOOTHED HER HAIR
5665-38052-0021 SLIPPED ON AN ENVELOPING APRON OVER HER RIDING CLOTHES AND HAD THE CHOPS FRYING THE SIGHT WARMED HIS HEART AS HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT WHICH CAME THROUGH THE ENTRANCE
5665-38052-0022 HE HAD SEEN THE SAME THING OFTEN BEFORE BUT IT NEVER HAD IMPRESSED HIM PARTICULARLY HER PRESENCE IN THE CANVAS TENT MADE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOME AND A MERE SHELTER THE SMALL CRUMBS OF BREAD HE HAD CAST UPON THE WATER
5665-38052-0023 WERE INDEED COMING BACK TO HIM I'VE RIDDEN OVER FORTY MILES SINCE MORNING SHE CHATTERED WHILE HE FLUNG THE SNOW FLAKES FROM HIS HAT BRIM AND BRUSHED THEM FROM HIS SHOULDERS THE WIND BLEW THE HORSES TRACKS OUT SO I COULDN'T FOLLOW THEM
5665-38052-0024 I NEVER CAUGHT SIGHT OF THEM UNTIL JUST THIS SIDE OF PROUTY YOU CAN SIT DOWN UNCLE JOE EVERYTHING'S READY THEY TALKED OF THE COMING SNOWSTORM AND THE ADVISABILITY OF HOLDING THE SHEEP ON THE BED GROUND IF IT SHOULD BE A BAD ONE
5665-38052-0025 OF THE TRIP TO TOWN THAT HE WAS CONTEMPLATING OF THE COYOTE THAT WAS BOTHERING AND THE POSSIBILITY OF TRAPPING HIM THERE WAS NO DEARTH OF TOPICS OF MUTUAL INTEREST NEVERTHELESS MORMON JOE KNEW THAT SHE WAS HOLDING SOMETHING IN RESERVE
5665-38052-0026 AND WONDERED AT THIS RETICENCE IT CAME FINALLY WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED AND STILL LINGERED AT THE TABLE
5665-38052-0027 TEETERS MORMON JOE WAS TEARING A LEAF FROM HIS BOOK OF CIGARETTE PAPERS GUESS AGAIN HE SHOOK HIS HEAD CAN'T IMAGINE SHE ANNOUNCED IMPRESSIVELY MISSUS TOOMEY
5665-38052-0028 HE WAS DISTRIBUTING TOBACCO FROM THE SACK UPON THE CREASE IN THE PAPER WITH EXACTITUDE HE MADE NO COMMENT SO KATE SAID WITH INCREASED EMPHASIS SHE WAS CRYING
5665-38052-0029 STILL HE WAS SILENT AND SHE DEMANDED AREN'T YOU SURPRISED SHE LOOKED CRESTFALLEN SO HE ASKED OBLIGINGLY WHERE DID ALL OF THIS HAPPEN
5665-38052-0030 THEY HAD GONE THERE TO GET OUT OF THE WIND AND IT WAS BY ONLY A CHANCE THAT I RODE DOWN INTO IT SHE WAS IN THE BOTTOM HUDDLED AGAINST A ROCK AND DIDN'T SEE ME UNTIL I WAS NEARLY ON HER I THOUGHT SHE WAS SICK SHE LOOKED TERRIBLE
5665-38052-0031 AND WAS SHE NO SHE WAS WORRIED NATURALLY ANY WOMAN WOULD BE WHO MARRIED TOOMEY ABOUT MONEY INDEED HIS TONE AND SMILE WERE IRONIC
5665-38052-0032 KATE A TRIFLE DISCONCERTED CONTINUED HE'S HAD BAD LUCK HE'S HAD THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES OF ANY MAN WHO'S COME INTO THE COUNTRY ANYWAY SHE FALTERED THEY HAVEN'T A PENNY EXCEPT WHEN THEY SELL SOMETHING
5665-38052-0033 HE SHRUGGED A SHOULDER THEN ASKED TEASINGLY WELL WHAT WERE YOU THINKING OF DOING ABOUT IT I SAID
5665-38052-0034 BLUNTLY THAT WE'D LOAN THEM MONEY WHAT INCREDULOUSLY I DID UNCLE JOE HE ANSWERED WITH A FROWN OF ANNOYANCE YOU EXCEEDED YOUR AUTHORITY KATIE BUT YOU WILL WON'T YOU SHE PLEADED
5665-38052-0035 YOU'VE NEVER REFUSED ME ANYTHING THAT I REALLY WANTED BADLY AND I'VE NEVER ASKED MUCH HAVE I NO GIRL YOU HAVEN'T HE REPLIED GENTLY AND THERE'S HARDLY ANYTHING YOU COULD ASK WITHIN REASON THAT WOULDN'T BE GRANTED
5665-38052-0036 BUT THEY ONLY NEED FIVE HUNDRED UNTIL HE GETS INTO SOMETHING YOU COULD LET THEM HAVE THAT COULDN'T YOU HIS FACE AND EYES HARDENED I COULD BUT I WON'T HE REPLIED CURTLY WHEN PROUTY WAS IN ITS INFANCY
5665-38052-0037 CERTAIN CITIZENS HAD BEEN MISLED BY MORMON JOE'S MILD EYES LOW VOICE AND QUIET MANNER HIS EASY GOING EXTERIOR CONCEALED AN INCREDIBLE HARDNESS UPON OCCASIONS BUT THIS WAS KATE'S FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF IT
5665-38052-0038 IN ANY DIFFERENCE WHEN HE HAD NOT YIELDED TO HER GOOD NATUREDLY THEY HAD ARGUED IT OUT AS THOUGH THEY WERE IN REALITY PARTNERS AT ANOTHER TIME SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WOUNDED BY HIS BRUSQUE REFUSAL BUT TO NIGHT IT ANGERED HER
5665-38052-0039 BECAUSE OF HER INTENSE EAGERNESS AND CONFIDENCE THAT SHE HAD ONLY TO ASK HIM IT CAME AS THE KEENEST OF DISAPPOINTMENTS THIS TOGETHER WITH HER FATIGUE COMBINED TO PRODUCE A DISPLAY OF TEMPER AS UNUSUAL IN HER
5665-38052-0040 AS MORMON JOE'S OWN ATTITUDE BUT I PROMISED SHE CRIED IMPATIENTLY AND YOU'VE TOLD ME I MUST ALWAYS KEEP MY PROMISE IF IT TAKES THE HIDE YOU EXCEEDED YOUR AUTHORITY HE REITERATED
5665-38052-0041 YOU'VE NO RIGHT TO PROMISE WHAT DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU THEN IT'S ALL TALK ABOUT OUR BEING PARTNERS SHE SAID SNEERINGLY
5665-38052-0042 BECAUSE YOU DON'T CARE FOR FRIENDS YOU DON'T WANT ME TO HAVE ANY SHE FLUNG AT HIM HOTLY HE WAS SILENT A LONG TIME THINKING WHILE SHE WAITED ANGRILY THEN HE RESPONDED QUIETLY AND WITH OBVIOUS EFFORT
5665-38052-0043 THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE MISTAKEN KATIE IF I HAVE ONE REGRET IT IS THAT IN THE PAST I HAVE NOT MORE DELIBERATELY CULTIVATED THE FRIENDSHIP OF TRUE MEN AND GENTLE WOMEN WHEN I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY
5665-38052-0044 IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE WHETHER THEY ARE BRILLIANT OR RICH OR SUCCESSFUL IF ONLY THEY ARE TRUE HEARTED LOYALTY IS THE GREAT ATTRIBUTE BUT AND HE SHRUGGED A SHOULDER IT IS MY JUDGMENT
5665-38052-0045 THAT YOU WILL NOT FIND IT IN THAT QUARTER
5665-38052-0046 WE WERE GOING TO BE FRIENDS MISSUS TOOMEY AND I WE SHOOK HANDS ON IT
5665-38052-0047 HE REPLIED DOGGEDLY IF YOU HAVE TO BUY YOUR FRIENDSHIPS KATIE YOU'D BETTER KEEP YOUR MONEY THE SPEECH STUNG HER SHE GLARED AT HIM ACROSS THE NARROW TABLE AND IN THE MOMENT EACH HAD A SENSE OF UNREALITY
5665-38052-0048 THE QUARREL WAS LIKE A BOLT FROM THE BLUE AS STARTLING AND UNEXPECTED AS MOST QUARRELS ARE THE BITTEREST AND MOST LASTING THEN SHE SPRANG TO HER FEET AND HURLED A TAUNT AT HIM SOME IMP OF DARKNESS MUST HAVE SUGGESTED
5665-38052-0049 YOU'RE JEALOUS SHE STAMPED A FOOT AT HIM THAT'S THE REAL REASON YOU'RE JEALOUS OF EVERYBODY THAT WOULD BE FRIENDS WITH ME YOU'RE JEALOUS OF HUGHIE YOU DIDN'T LIKE HIS COMING HERE AND YOU DON'T LIKE HIS WRITING TO ME I HATE YOU I WON'T STAY ANY LONGER
5665-38052-0050 AND THERE WAS THE LOOK OF HER MOTHER ON THE GIRL'S FACE IN HER RECKLESS UNCONTROLLED FURY MORMON JOE WINCED EXACTLY AS THOUGH SHE HAD STRUCK HIM HE SAT QUITE STILL WHILE THE COLOR FADED LEAVING HIS FACE BLOODLESS
5665-38052-0051 KATE NEVER HAD KNOWN ANYTHING LIKE THE WHITE RAGE IT DEPICTED PERSONS AT THE SAND COULEE WHO LOST THEIR TEMPER CURSED VOLUBLY AND LOUDLY AND THREATENED OR MADE BODILY ATTACKS UPON THE CAUSE OF IT
5665-38052-0052 IN SPITE OF HERSELF SHE SHRANK A LITTLE AS HE TOO GOT UP SLOWLY AND FACED HER SHE DIDN'T KNOW HIM AT ALL THIS MAN WHO FIRST THREW HIS CIGARETTE AWAY CAREFULLY AS THOUGH HE WERE IN A DRAWING ROOM AND MUST REGARD THE ASHES
5665-38052-0053 HE WAS A PERSONALITY FROM AN ENVIRONMENT WITH WHICH SHE WAS UNFAMILIAR THEN AS THOUGH SHE WERE HIS EQUAL IN YEARS EXPERIENCE AND INTELLIGENCE HE SPOKE TO HER IN A TONE THAT WAS COOL AND IMPERSONAL
5665-38052-0054 YET WHICH WENT SLASH SLASH SLASH LIKE THE FINE DEEP QUICK CUT OF A RAZOR I HAD NO NOTION THAT YOU ENTERTAINED ANY SUCH FEELING TOWARDS ME IT IS SOMETHING IN THE NATURE OF A ER REVELATION
5665-38052-0055 YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT ABOUT LEAVING UPON SECOND THOUGHT YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING RIGHT TO KEEP YOUR PROMISE TO MISSUS TOOMEY SINCE YOU GAVE IT RIGHT IN YOUR ASSERTION THAT I AM JEALOUS I AM BUT NOT IN THE SENSE IN WHICH YOU MEAN IT
5665-38052-0056 I HAVE BEEN JEALOUS OF YOUR DIGNITY OF THE RESPECT THAT IS DUE YOU I HAVE RESENTED KEENLY ANY ATTEMPT TO BELITTLE YOU
5665-38052-0057 IT IS THE REASON WHY I HAVE NOT SHOWN A PLEASURE I DID NOT FEEL IN HIS WRITING YOU WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE DEMANDED I MEAN THAT HE TOOK YOU TO THAT DANCE ON A WAGER A BET TO PROVE THAT HE HAD THE COURAGE
5665-38052-0058 TO MAKE A SPECTACLE OF YOU FOR A STORY WITH WHICH TO REGALE HIS FRIENDS AND LAUGH OVER SHE GROPED FOR THE EDGE OF THE TABLE WHO TOLD YOU TOOMEY I DON'T BELIEVE IT TEETERS VERIFIED IT
5665-38052-0059 SHE SAT DOWN ON THE BOX FROM WHICH SHE HAD RISEN UNMOVED BY THE BLOW HE HAD DEALT HER HE CONTINUED YOU WENT TO THAT DANCE AGAINST MY WISHES WHAT I EXPECTED TO HAPPEN DID HAPPEN THOUGH YOU DID NOT CHOOSE TO TELL ME
5665-38052-0060 IN MY DESCENT THROUGH VARIOUS STRATA OF SOCIETY I HAVE LEARNED SOMETHING OF TYPES AND OF HUMAN NATURE IN PROTESTING MY ONLY THOUGHT WAS TO SAVE YOU PAIN AND DISAPPOINTMENT AS IN THIS INSTANCE
5665-38052-0061 BUT EXPERIENCE IT SEEMS IS THE ONLY TEACHER TO MORROW I AM GOING TO PROUTY HIRE A HERDER TO DO YOUR WORK AND MORTGAGE THE OUTFIT FOR HALF ITS VALUE IT WILL BE YOURS TO USE AS IT PLEASES YOU YOU HAVE EARNED IT
5665-38052-0062 THEN WITH A GESTURE OF FINALITY THE DOOR IS OPEN TO YOU I WANT YOU TO GO WHERE YOU WILL BE HAPPY WITH HIS USUAL DELIBERATION OF MOVEMENT HE PUT ON HIS HAT AND WENT OUT TO CHANGE THE HORSES ON PICKET
5665-38052-0063 WHILE KATE STUNNED BY THE INCREDIBLE CRISIS AND THE REVELATION CONCERNING HUGH DISSTON SAT WHERE SHE HAD DROPPED STARING AT THE AGATE WARE PLATTER UPON WHICH THE MUTTON GREASE WAS HARDENING
5665-38052-0064 IT WAS MORMON JOE'S INVARIABLE CUSTOM TO HELP HER WITH THE DISHES BUT HE DID NOT RETURN SO SHE AROSE FINALLY AND SET THE FOOD AWAY AUTOMATICALLY WITH THE UNSEEING LOOK OF A HYPNOTIC SUBJECT
5665-38052-0065 SHE WASHED THE DISHES AND DRIED THEM TRYING TO REALIZE THAT SHE WOULD BE LEAVING THIS SHORTLY THAT THERE WOULD BE A LAST TIME IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE HER ANGER WAS LOST IN GRIEF AND AMAZEMENT
5665-38052-0066 THERE WAS SOMETHING SO IMPLACABLE SO STEEL LIKE IN MORMON JOE'S HARDNESS THAT IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HER TO PLEAD WITH HIM FOR FORGIVENESS AND HUGHIE SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT SHE COULD NOT TURN TO A TRAITOR FOR HELP OR SYMPATHY
5665-38052-0067 SHE BLEW OUT THE LANTERN TIED THE TENT FLAP BEHIND HER AND RAN THROUGH THE FAST FALLING SNOW TO HER WAGON KATE DOZED TOWARDS MORNING
5665-38052-0068 AND WAS AWAKENED BY A HORSE'S WHINNY LISTENING A MOMENT SHE SPRANG OUT AND LOOKED THROUGH THE UPPER HALF OF THE DOOR WHICH OPENED ON HINGES IT WAS A WHITE WORLD THAT SHE SAW WITH SOME FOUR INCHES OF SNOW ON THE LEVEL
5665-38052-0069 THOUGH THE FALL HAD CEASED AND IT WAS COLDER MORMON JOE DRESSED WARMLY IN LEATHER CHAPS AND SHEEP LINED COAT WAS RIDING AWAY ON ONE OF THE WORK HORSES NEVER SINCE THEY HAD BEEN TOGETHER HAD HE GONE TO PROUTY
5665-38052-0070 WITHOUT SOME WORD OF FAREWELL CARELESS AND CASUAL BUT UNFAILING NOR COULD SHE REMEMBER WHEN HE HAD NOT TURNED IN THE SADDLE AND WAVED AT HER BEFORE THEY LOST SIGHT OF EACH OTHER ALTOGETHER THIS TIME SHE WAITED VAINLY
5665-38052-0071 HE WENT WITHOUT LOOKING BEHIND HIM WHILE SHE STOOD IN THE COLD WATCHING HIS PEAKED HIGH CROWNED HAT BOBBING THROUGH THE GIANT SAGEBRUSH UNTIL IT VANISHED SHE HAD THRUST OUT A HAND TO DETAIN HIM TO CALL AFTER HIM AND HAD WITHDRAWN IT
