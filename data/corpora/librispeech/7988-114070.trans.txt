7988-114070-0000 AMONG THE ICE PACKS FOR THE NEXT FORTY FIVE DAYS OUR TIME WAS EMPLOYED IN DODGING ICEBERGS AND HUNTING CHANNELS INDEED
7988-114070-0001 HAD WE NOT BEEN FAVORED WITH A STRONG SOUTH WIND AND A SMALL BOAT I DOUBT IF THIS STORY COULD HAVE EVER BEEN GIVEN TO THE WORLD AT LAST THERE CAME A MORNING WHEN MY FATHER SAID MY SON I THINK WE ARE TO SEE HOME
7988-114070-0002 WE ARE ALMOST THROUGH THE ICE SEE THE OPEN WATER LIES BEFORE US HOWEVER THERE WERE A FEW ICEBERGS THAT HAD FLOATED FAR NORTHWARD
7988-114070-0003 INTO THE OPEN WATER STILL AHEAD OF US ON EITHER SIDE STRETCHING AWAY FOR MANY MILES DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF US AND BY THE COMPASS WHICH HAD NOW RIGHTED ITSELF DUE NORTH THERE WAS AN OPEN SEA
7988-114070-0004 WHAT A WONDERFUL STORY WE HAVE TO TELL TO THE PEOPLE OF STOCKHOLM CONTINUED MY FATHER
7988-114070-0005 LIGHTED UP HIS HONEST FACE AND THINK OF THE GOLD NUGGETS STOWED AWAY IN THE HOLD I SPOKE KIND WORDS OF PRAISE TO MY FATHER NOT ALONE FOR HIS FORTITUDE AND ENDURANCE
7988-114070-0006 I WAS GRATEFUL TOO THAT HE HAD GATHERED THE WEALTH OF GOLD WE WERE CARRYING HOME
7988-114070-0007 WHILE CONGRATULATING OURSELVES ON THE GOODLY SUPPLY OF PROVISIONS AND WATER WE STILL HAD ON HAND AND ON THE DANGERS WE HAD ESCAPED WE WERE STARTLED BY HEARING A MOST TERRIFIC EXPLOSION CAUSED BY THE TEARING APART OF A HUGE MOUNTAIN OF ICE
7988-114070-0008 IT WAS A DEAFENING ROAR LIKE THE FIRING OF A THOUSAND CANNON WE WERE SAILING AT THE TIME WITH GREAT SPEED AND HAPPENED TO BE NEAR A MONSTROUS ICEBERG WHICH TO ALL APPEARANCES WAS AS IMMOVABLE AS A ROCKBOUND ISLAND
7988-114070-0009 IT SEEMED HOWEVER THAT THE ICEBERG HAD SPLIT AND WAS BREAKING APART WHEREUPON THE BALANCE OF THE MONSTER ALONG WHICH WE WERE SAILING WAS DESTROYED AND IT BEGAN DIPPING FROM US
7988-114070-0010 MY FATHER QUICKLY ANTICIPATED THE DANGER BEFORE I REALIZED ITS AWFUL POSSIBILITIES THE ICEBERG EXTENDED DOWN INTO THE WATER MANY HUNDREDS OF FEET AND AS IT TIPPED OVER THE PORTION
7988-114070-0011 AND THREW IT INTO THE AIR AS IF IT HAD BEEN A FOOT BALL OUR BOAT FELL BACK ON THE ICEBERG THAT BY THIS TIME HAD CHANGED THE SIDE NEXT TO US FOR THE TOP MY FATHER WAS STILL IN THE BOAT HAVING BECOME ENTANGLED IN THE RIGGING WHILE I WAS THROWN SOME TWENTY FEET AWAY
7988-114070-0012 I QUICKLY SCRAMBLED TO MY FEET AND SHOUTED TO MY FATHER WHO ANSWERED ALL IS WELL JUST THEN A REALIZATION DAWNED UPON ME HORROR UPON HORROR THE BLOOD FROZE IN MY VEINS
7988-114070-0013 I FULLY REALIZED WHAT A SUCKING MAELSTROM IT WOULD PRODUCE AMID THE WORLDS OF WATER ON EVERY SIDE THEY WOULD RUSH INTO THE DEPRESSION IN ALL THEIR FURY LIKE WHITE FANGED WOLVES EAGER FOR HUMAN PREY
7988-114070-0014 IN THIS SUPREME MOMENT OF MENTAL ANGUISH I REMEMBER GLANCING AT OUR BOAT WHICH WAS LYING ON ITS SIDE AND WONDERING IF IT COULD POSSIBLY RIGHT ITSELF AND IF MY FATHER COULD ESCAPE WAS THIS THE END OF OUR STRUGGLES AND ADVENTURES
7988-114070-0015 WAS THIS DEATH ALL THESE QUESTIONS FLASHED THROUGH MY MIND IN THE FRACTION OF A SECOND AND A MOMENT LATER I WAS ENGAGED IN A LIFE AND DEATH STRUGGLE
7988-114070-0016 THE PONDEROUS MONOLITH OF ICE SANK BELOW THE SURFACE AND THE FRIGID WATERS GURGLED AROUND ME IN FRENZIED ANGER I WAS IN A SAUCER WITH THE WATERS POURING IN ON EVERY SIDE A MOMENT MORE AND I LOST CONSCIOUSNESS
7988-114070-0017 WHEN I PARTIALLY RECOVERED MY SENSES
7988-114070-0018 I FOUND MYSELF WET STIFF AND ALMOST FROZEN LYING ON THE ICEBERG BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF MY FATHER OR OF OUR LITTLE FISHING SLOOP THE MONSTER BERG HAD RECOVERED ITSELF AND WITH ITS NEW BALANCE
7988-114070-0019 LIFTED ITS HEAD PERHAPS FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE WAVES THE TOP OF THIS ISLAND OF ICE WAS A PLATEAU PERHAPS HALF AN ACRE IN EXTENT I LOVED MY FATHER WELL AND WAS GRIEF STRICKEN AT THE AWFULNESS OF HIS DEATH
7988-114070-0020 THAT I TOO HAD NOT BEEN PERMITTED TO SLEEP WITH HIM IN THE DEPTHS OF THE OCEAN FINALLY
7988-114070-0021 THE PURPLE DOMED SKY ABOVE THE SHORELESS GREEN OCEAN BENEATH AND ONLY AN OCCASIONAL ICEBERG DISCERNIBLE MY HEART SANK IN HOPELESS DESPAIR
7988-114070-0022 I CAUTIOUSLY PICKED MY WAY ACROSS THE BERG TOWARD THE OTHER SIDE HOPING THAT OUR FISHING CRAFT HAD RIGHTED ITSELF DARED I THINK IT POSSIBLE THAT MY FATHER STILL LIVED
7988-114070-0023 LIKE SOME RARE STIMULANT THROUGH EVERY FIBER OF MY BODY I CREPT CLOSE TO THE PRECIPITOUS SIDE OF THE ICEBERG AND PEERED FAR DOWN HOPING STILL HOPING THEN I MADE A CIRCLE OF THE BERG
7988-114070-0024 SCANNING EVERY FOOT OF THE WAY AND THUS I KEPT GOING AROUND AND AROUND ONE PART OF MY BRAIN WAS CERTAINLY BECOMING MANIACAL WHILE THE OTHER PART I BELIEVE AND DO
7988-114070-0025 ABERRATION BEWITCHED AND COMPELLED ME STILL TO BEGUILE MYSELF WITH EXPECTATION THE OTHER PART OF MY BRAIN SEEMED TO TELL ME THAT WHILE THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF MY FATHER BEING ALIVE
7988-114070-0026 I FELT THAT I SHOULD GO MAD THUS HOUR AFTER HOUR I WALKED AROUND AND AROUND AFRAID TO STOP AND REST YET PHYSICALLY POWERLESS TO CONTINUE MUCH LONGER
7988-114070-0027 OH HORROR OF HORRORS TO BE CAST AWAY IN THIS WIDE EXPANSE OF WATERS WITHOUT FOOD OR DRINK AND ONLY A TREACHEROUS ICEBERG FOR AN ABIDING PLACE MY HEART SANK WITHIN ME
7988-114070-0028 AND ALL SEMBLANCE OF HOPE WAS FADING INTO BLACK DESPAIR THEN THE HAND OF THE DELIVERER WAS EXTENDED AND THE DEATH LIKE STILLNESS OF A SOLITUDE RAPIDLY BECOMING UNBEARABLE WAS SUDDENLY BROKEN BY THE FIRING OF A SIGNAL GUN
7988-114070-0029 I LOOKED UP IN STARTLED AMAZEMENT WHEN I SAW LESS THAN A HALF MILE AWAY A WHALING VESSEL BEARING DOWN TOWARD ME WITH HER SAIL FULL SET EVIDENTLY MY CONTINUED ACTIVITY ON THE ICEBERG HAD ATTRACTED THEIR ATTENTION
7988-114070-0030 ON DRAWING NEAR THEY PUT OUT A BOAT AND DESCENDING CAUTIOUSLY TO THE WATER'S EDGE I WAS RESCUED AND A LITTLE LATER LIFTED ON BOARD THE WHALING SHIP I FOUND IT WAS A SCOTCH WHALER THE ARLINGTON
7988-114070-0031 THE CAPTAIN ANGUS MAC PHERSON
7988-114070-0032 AS I SOON LEARNED POSSESSED OF AN IRON WILL WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO TELL HIM THAT I HAD COME FROM THE INSIDE OF THE EARTH THE CAPTAIN AND MATE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER SHOOK THEIR HEADS AND INSISTED ON MY BEING PUT IN A BUNK UNDER STRICT SURVEILLANCE OF THE SHIP'S PHYSICIAN
7988-114070-0033 I WAS VERY WEAK FOR WANT OF FOOD AND HAD NOT SLEPT FOR MANY HOURS HOWEVER AFTER A FEW DAYS REST I GOT UP ONE MORNING AND DRESSED MYSELF WITHOUT ASKING PERMISSION OF THE PHYSICIAN OR ANYONE ELSE AND TOLD THEM THAT I WAS AS SANE AS ANYONE
7988-114070-0034 THE CAPTAIN SENT FOR ME AND AGAIN QUESTIONED ME CONCERNING WHERE I HAD COME FROM AND HOW I CAME TO BE ALONE ON AN ICEBERG IN THE FAR OFF ANTARCTIC OCEAN I REPLIED THAT I HAD
7988-114070-0035 AND COME OUT BY WAY OF THE SOUTH POLE COUNTRY WHEREUPON I WAS PUT IN IRONS I AFTERWARD HEARD THE CAPTAIN TELL THE MATE THAT I WAS AS CRAZY AS A MARCH HARE AND THAT I MUST REMAIN IN CONFINEMENT UNTIL I WAS RATIONAL ENOUGH TO GIVE A TRUTHFUL ACCOUNT OF MYSELF
7988-114070-0036 FINALLY AFTER MUCH PLEADING AND MANY PROMISES I WAS RELEASED FROM IRONS I THEN AND THERE DECIDED TO INVENT SOME STORY THAT WOULD SATISFY THE CAPTAIN
7988-114070-0037 WITHIN A FORTNIGHT I WAS PERMITTED TO GO ABOUT AND TAKE MY PLACE AS ONE OF THE SEAMEN A LITTLE LATER THE CAPTAIN ASKED ME FOR AN EXPLANATION I TOLD HIM THAT MY EXPERIENCE HAD BEEN SO HORRIBLE THAT I WAS FEARFUL OF MY MEMORY
7988-114070-0038 AND BEGGED HIM TO PERMIT ME TO LEAVE THE QUESTION UNANSWERED UNTIL SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE I THINK YOU ARE RECOVERING CONSIDERABLY HE SAID BUT YOU ARE NOT SANE YET BY A GOOD DEAL
7988-114070-0039 PERMIT ME TO DO SUCH WORK AS YOU MAY ASSIGN I REPLIED AND IF IT DOES NOT COMPENSATE YOU SUFFICIENTLY I WILL PAY YOU IMMEDIATELY AFTER I REACH STOCKHOLM TO THE LAST PENNY THUS THE MATTER RESTED
7988-114070-0040 ON FINALLY REACHING STOCKHOLM AS I HAVE ALREADY RELATED I FOUND THAT MY GOOD MOTHER HAD GONE TO HER REWARD MORE THAN A YEAR BEFORE I HAVE ALSO TOLD HOW LATER THE TREACHERY OF A RELATIVE
7988-114070-0041 LANDED ME IN A MADHOUSE WHERE I REMAINED FOR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS
7988-114070-0042 STILL LATER AFTER MY RELEASE HOW I RETURNED TO THE LIFE OF A FISHERMAN FOLLOWING IT SEDULOUSLY FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS THEN HOW I CAME TO AMERICA AND
7988-114070-0043 FINALLY TO LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA BUT ALL THIS CAN BE OF LITTLE INTEREST TO THE READER
