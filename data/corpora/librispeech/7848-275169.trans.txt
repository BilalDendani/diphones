7848-275169-0017 THE MAGISTRATE QUESTIONED HIM AND BROUGHT TO LIGHT A REALLY HEART BREAKING ACCOUNT OF MISFORTUNE
7848-275169-0018 HE WAS REMANDED SO THAT INQUIRIES MIGHT BE MADE I ATTENDED THE COURT ON THE DAY WHEN HE APPEARED THERE AGAIN AND HEARD HIS STATEMENT CONFIRMED I PAID HIS FINE
7848-275169-0019 HE WAS VERY GRATEFUL AND CAME NOW AND THEN TO THANK ME
7848-275169-0020 HE HAD ASKED FOR A SMALL ADVANCE ON THE WRETCHED WAGES THAT HE RECEIVED CAN YOU GUESS HOW THE SCHOOLMISTRESS ANSWERED HIM I KNOW BUT TOO WELL HOW SHE ANSWERED HIM SYDNEY SAID I WAS TURNED OUT OF THE HOUSE TOO
7848-275169-0021 AND I HEARD OF IT THE CAPTAIN REPLIED
7848-275169-0022 EVERYTHING THAT COULD DISTRESS ME SHE WAS READY TO MENTION SHE TOLD ME OF YOUR MOTHER'S SECOND MARRIAGE OF HER MISERABLE DEATH OF THE POOR BOY YOUR BROTHER MISSING AND NEVER HEARD OF SINCE

7848-275169-0029 YOU CAN BE OF THE GREATEST USE TO ME YOU SHALL HEAR HOW HE TOLD HER OF THE FOUNDING OF HIS HOME AND OF THE GOOD IT HAD DONE YOU ARE THE VERY PERSON HE RESUMED
7848-275169-0030 SHE SAID AND TO GIVE IT UP AS SOON AS IT IS SEEN WHY GIVE IT UP
7848-275169-0031 YOU ARE AS GOOD AS A FATHER TO THOSE LOST DAUGHTERS OF YOURS IF YOU GIVE THEM A SISTER FRIEND SHE OUGHT TO HAVE SET THEM A GOOD EXAMPLE
7848-275169-0032 GLADLY
7848-275169-0033 BECAUSE IT IS ANIMATED BY SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN ALL FEEL IN COMMON SOMETHING NEARER AND DEARER TO THEM THAN A SENSE OF DUTY YOU WON'T CONSENT SYDNEY FOR THEIR SAKES
7848-275169-0034 FOR MY SAKE SHE LOOKED AT HIM HARDLY ABLE TO UNDERSTAND OR AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PERHAPS AFRAID TO UNDERSTAND HIM HE SPOKE TO HER MORE PLAINLY I HAVE KEPT IT CONCEALED FROM YOU HE CONTINUED
7848-275169-0035 SO CRUELLY TRIED ALREADY LET ME ONLY SAY THAT I AM IN GREAT DISTRESS IF YOU WERE WITH ME MY CHILD I MIGHT BE BETTER ABLE TO BEAR IT HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
7848-275169-0036 EVEN A HAPPY WOMAN COULD HARDLY HAVE FOUND IT IN HER HEART TO RESIST HIM IN SILENT SYMPATHY AND RESPECT SYDNEY KISSED THE HAND THAT HE HAD OFFERED TO HER
7848-275169-0037 STILL ENCOURAGING HER TO SEE NEW HOPES AND NEW INTERESTS IN THE FUTURE THE GOOD CAPTAIN SPOKE OF THE SHARE WHICH SHE MIGHT TAKE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE HOME
7848-275169-0038 RELATING TO THE INSTITUTION WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM DURING THE TIME OF HIS RESIDENCE AT SYDENHAM SHE READ THEM WITH AN INTEREST AND ATTENTION WHICH AMPLY JUSTIFIED HIS CONFIDENCE IN HER CAPACITY THESE REPORTS HE EXPLAINED TO HER
7848-275169-0039 BUT AS A MEANS OF SAVING TIME THE SUBSTANCE OF THEM IS ENTERED IN THE DAILY JOURNAL OF OUR PROCEEDINGS COME SYDNEY VENTURE ON A FIRST EXPERIMENT IN YOUR NEW CHARACTER I SEE PEN INK AND PAPER ON THE TABLE TRY IF YOU CAN SHORTEN ONE OF THE REPORTS
7848-275169-0040 FOR INSTANCE THE WRITER GIVES REASONS FOR MAKING HIS STATEMENT VERY WELL EXPRESSED NO DOUBT BUT WE DON'T WANT REASONS THEN AGAIN HE OFFERS HIS OWN OPINION ON THE RIGHT COURSE TO TAKE
7848-275169-0041 BUT I DON'T WANT HIS OPINION I WANT HIS FACTS TAKE THE PEN MY SECRETARY AND SET DOWN HIS FACTS NEVER MIND HIS REFLECTIONS PROUD AND PLEASED SYDNEY OBEYED HIM
7848-275169-0042 AND WAS READING IT TO HIM AT HIS REQUEST WHILE HE COMPARED IT WITH THE REPORT WHEN THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY A VISITOR RANDAL LINLEY CAME IN AND NOTICED THE PAPERS ON THE TABLE WITH SURPRISE
7848-275169-0043 RANDAL AT ONCE UNDERSTOOD WHAT HAD HAPPENED HE TOOK HIS FRIEND'S ARM AND LED HIM TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM YOU GOOD FELLOW HE SAID ADD TO YOUR KINDNESS BY EXCUSING ME IF I ASK FOR A WORD WITH YOU IN PRIVATE SYDNEY ROSE TO RETIRE
7848-275169-0044 AFTER HAVING ENCOURAGED HER BY A WORD OF PRAISE THE CAPTAIN PROPOSED THAT SHE SHOULD GET READY TO GO OUT AND SHOULD ACCOMPANY HIM ON A VISIT TO THE HOME HE OPENED THE DOOR FOR HER AS RESPECTFULLY AS IF THE POOR GIRL HAD BEEN ONE OF THE HIGHEST LADIES IN THE LAND
7848-275169-0045 I HAVE SEEN MY FRIEND SARRAZIN RANDAL BEGAN AND I HAVE PERSUADED HIM TO TRUST ME WITH CATHERINE'S PRESENT ADDRESS I CAN SEND HERBERT THERE IMMEDIATELY IF YOU WILL ONLY HELP ME
7848-275169-0046 WILL YOU ALLOW ME TO TELL MY BROTHER THAT YOUR ENGAGEMENT IS BROKEN OFF BENNYDECK SHRANK FROM THE PAINFUL ALLUSION AND SHOWED IT RANDAL EXPLAINED I AM GRIEVED HE SAID TO DISTRESS YOU BY REFERRING TO THIS SUBJECT AGAIN
