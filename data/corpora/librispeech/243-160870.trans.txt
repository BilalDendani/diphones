243-160870-0000 LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD IN A GREAT WIDE FOREST FULL OF BEAUTIFUL TREES AND GREEN GLADES AND THORNY THICKETS THERE LIVED A LONG TIME AGO A WOOD CUTTER AND HIS WIFE
243-160870-0001 WHO HAD ONLY ONE CHILD A LITTLE GIRL SHE WAS SO PRETTY AND SO GOOD THAT THE SUN SEEMED TO SHINE MORE BRIGHTLY WHEN ITS LIGHT FELL UPON HER ROSY LITTLE FACE
243-160870-0002 AND THE BIRDS WOULD SEEM TO SING MORE SWEETLY WHEN SHE WAS PASSING BY HER REAL NAME WAS MAISIE BUT THE NEIGHBORS ROUND ABOUT ALL CALLED HER LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD
243-160870-0003 WAS AT THE TIME WHEN ALL THE BIRDS AND BEASTS OR VERY NEARLY ALL COULD SPEAK JUST AS WELL AS YOU OR I AND NOBODY WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THEM TALK AS I SUPPOSE ONE WOULD BE NOWADAYS WELL
243-160870-0004 AS I WAS SAYING LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD LIVED WITH HER PARENTS IN A LITTLE WHITE COTTAGE WITH A GREEN DOOR AND A THATCHED ROOF AND RED AND WHITE ROSES CLIMBING ALL OVER THE WALLS
243-160870-0005 TO PEEP AT THE CHILD WHO WAS SO LIKE THEM IT WAS ON A BRIGHT SPRING MORNING EARLY IN MAY WHEN LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD HAD JUST FINISHED PUTTING AWAY THE BREAKFAST CUPS THAT HER MOTHER CAME BUSTLING IN FROM THE DAIRY
243-160870-0006 HERE'S A TO DO SHE SAID FARMER HODGE HAS THIS VERY MINUTE TOLD ME THAT HE HEARS YOUR GRANNIE ISN'T QUITE WELL AND I CAN'T LEAVE THE CHEESE MAKING THIS MORNING FOR LOVE OR MONEY DO YOU GO MY DEAR
243-160870-0007 HERE'S YOUR BASKET AND DON'T BE TOO LONG AWAY HONEY SO LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD
243-160870-0008 AND SET OFF DOWN THE SUNNY GREEN SLOPE WITH HER BASKET IN HER HAND AT A BRISK PACE BUT AS SHE GOT DEEPER INTO THE FOREST SHE WALKED MORE SLOWLY EVERYTHING WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THE GREAT TREES WAVED THEIR HUGE ARMS OVER HER
243-160870-0009 ALL WHITE WITH BLOSSOM AND THE CHILD BEGAN SINGING AS SHE WENT SHE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD WHY BUT I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE THE BEAUTIFUL WORLD MADE HER FEEL GLAD THE PATH WOUND ALONG THROUGH THE TREES AND AS IT GREW WIDER AFTER TURNING A CORNER
243-160870-0010 FOR WHERE TWO CROSS PATHS DIVIDED THERE SAT A BIG GRAY WOLF LICKING HIS LONG PAWS AND LOOKING SHARPLY ABOUT HIM AND GOOD MORNING RED RIDING HOOD SAID HE GOOD MORNING MISTER WOLF SHE ANSWERED
243-160870-0011 AND WHERE MAY YOU BE GOING SWEET LASS SAID THE WOLF AS HE WALKED BESIDE HER OH GRANNIE ISN'T VERY WELL AND MOTHER CANNOT LEAVE THE CHEESE MAKING THIS MORNING AND SO I'M TAKING HER SOME LITTLE DAINTIES IN MY BASKET
243-160870-0012 AND I AM TO SEE HOW SHE IS AND TELL MOTHER WHEN I GET BACK SAID THE CHILD WITH A SMILE AND SAID THE WOLF
243-160870-0013 THROUGH THE COPSE AND DOWN THE HOLLOW AND OVER THE BRIDGE AND THREE MEADOWS AFTER THE MILL
243-160870-0014 WHY THEN I DO BELIEVE SHE IS A VERY DEAR OLD FRIEND OF MINE WHOM I HAVE NOT SEEN FOR YEARS AND YEARS NOW I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL DO YOU AND I I WILL GO BY THIS WAY AND YOU SHALL TAKE THAT AND WHOEVER GETS THERE FIRST
243-160870-0015 SHALL BE THE WINNER OF THE GAME SO THE WOLF TROTTED OFF ONE WAY AND RED RIDING HOOD WENT THE OTHER AND I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT SHE LINGERED AND LOITERED MORE THAN SHE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE ON THE ROAD WELL WHAT WITH ONE THING AND ANOTHER
243-160870-0016 WHEN SHE CROSSED THE LAST MEADOW FROM THE MILL
243-160870-0017 POOR GRANNIE MUST HAVE TO BE SURE TO MAKE HER SO HOARSE THOUGHT THE CHILD THEN SHE PULLED THE BOBBIN AND THE LATCH WENT UP AND RED RIDING HOOD PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR AND STEPPED INSIDE THE COTTAGE IT SEEMED VERY DARK IN THERE
243-160870-0018 AFTER THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT OUTSIDE AND ALL RED RIDING HOOD COULD SEE WAS THAT THE WINDOW CURTAINS AND THE BED CURTAINS WERE STILL DRAWN AND HER GRANDMOTHER SEEMED TO BE LYING IN BED WITH THE BED CLOTHES PULLED ALMOST OVER HER HEAD AND HER GREAT
243-160870-0019 WHITE FRILLED NIGHTCAP NEARLY HIDING HER FACE NOW YOU AND I HAVE GUESSED BY THIS TIME ALTHOUGH POOR RED RIDING HOOD NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING THAT IT WAS NOT HER GRANNIE AT ALL BUT THE WICKED WOLF WHO HAD HURRIED TO THE COTTAGE
243-160870-0020 THEN THE WOLF STRETCHED OUT HIS LARGE HAIRY PAWS AND BEGAN TO UNFASTEN THE BASKET OH SAID RED RIDING HOOD WHAT GREAT ARMS YOU HAVE GRANNIE
243-160870-0021 AND YOUR EYES GRANNIE WHAT GREAT YELLOW EYES YOU HAVE
243-160870-0022 AND OH OH GRANNIE CRIED THE CHILD IN A SAD FRIGHT
243-160870-0023 GROWLED THE WOLF SPRINGING UP SUDDENLY AT RED RIDING HOOD BUT JUST AT THAT VERY MOMENT THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND TWO TALL WOOD CUTTERS
243-160870-0024 BUT WHERE IS GRANNIE ASKED LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD WHEN SHE HAD THANKED THE BRAVE WOOD CUTTERS OH
243-160870-0025 CAN THE CRUEL WOLF HAVE EATEN HER UP AND SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND SOB BITTERLY WHEN WHO SHOULD WALK IN BUT GRANNIE HERSELF AS LARGE AS LIFE AND AS HEARTY AS EVER
