3955-38223-0000 CHAPTER ONE THE BIRTH OF REASON
3955-38223-0001 EXISTENCE ALWAYS HAS AN ORDER CALLED CHAOS WHEN INCOMPATIBLE WITH A CHOSEN GOOD WHETHER CHAOS OR ORDER LAY AT THE BEGINNING OF THINGS IS A QUESTION ONCE MUCH DEBATED IN THE SCHOOLS BUT AFTERWARD LONG IN ABEYANCE
3955-38223-0002 NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN SOLVED AS BECAUSE ONE PARTY HAD BEEN SILENCED BY SOCIAL PRESSURE
3955-38223-0003 IN REGENERATION THE ORDER NOW ESTABLISHED IN THE WORLD MAY BE TRACED BACK TO A SITUATION IN WHICH IT DID NOT APPEAR DIALECTICIANS ON THE OTHER HAND
3955-38223-0004 REFUTE THIS PRESUMPTION BY URGING THAT EVERY COLLOCATION OF THINGS MUST HAVE BEEN PRECEDED BY ANOTHER COLLOCATION IN ITSELF NO LESS DEFINITE AND PRECISE AND FURTHER THAT SOME PRINCIPLE OF TRANSITION OR CONTINUITY
3955-38223-0005 MUST ALWAYS HAVE OBTAINED ELSE SUCCESSIVE STATES WOULD STAND IN NO RELATION TO ONE ANOTHER NOTABLY NOT IN THE RELATION OF CAUSE AND EFFECT EXPRESSED IN A NATURAL LAW WHICH IS PRESUPPOSED IN THIS INSTANCE
3955-38223-0006 POTENTIALITIES ARE DISPOSITIONS AND A DISPOSITION INVOLVES AN ORDER AS DOES ALSO THE PASSAGE FROM ANY SPECIFIC POTENTIALITY INTO ACT THUS THE WORLD WE ARE TOLD MUST ALWAYS HAVE POSSESSED A STRUCTURE
3955-38223-0007 CHAOS DOUBTLESS HAS EXISTED AND WILL RETURN NAY IT REIGNS NOW VERY LIKELY IN THE REMOTER AND INMOST PARTS OF THE UNIVERSE
3955-38223-0008 A NATURE SUCH THAT HUMAN LIFE AND HUMAN THOUGHT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE
3955-38223-0009 BUT THIS NATURE MUST BE PRESUMED TO HAVE AN ORDER AN ORDER DIRECTLY IMPORTING IF THE TENDENCY OF ITS MOVEMENT BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE COMPLEXITIES AND BEAUTIES ALL THE SENSE AND REASON WHICH EXIST NOW
3955-38223-0010 ORDER IS ACCORDINGLY CONTINUAL BUT ONLY WHEN ORDER MEANS NOT A SPECIFIC ARRANGEMENT FAVOURABLE TO A GIVEN FORM OF LIFE BUT ANY ARRANGEMENT WHATSOEVER
3955-38223-0011 THE PROCESS BY WHICH AN ARRANGEMENT WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY UNSTABLE GRADUALLY SHIFTS CANNOT BE SAID TO AIM AT EVERY STAGE WHICH AT ANY MOMENT IT INVOLVES FOR THE PROCESS PASSES BEYOND
3955-38223-0012 IT PRESENTLY ABOLISHES ALL THE FORMS WHICH MAY HAVE ARRESTED ATTENTION AND GENERATED LOVE ITS INITIAL ENERGY DEFEATS EVERY PURPOSE WHICH WE MAY FONDLY ATTRIBUTE TO IT
3955-38223-0013 NOR IS IT HERE NECESSARY TO REMIND OURSELVES THAT TO CALL RESULTS THEIR OWN CAUSES IS ALWAYS PREPOSTEROUS FOR IN THIS CASE EVEN THE MYTHICAL SENSE WHICH MIGHT BE ATTACHED TO SUCH LANGUAGE IS INAPPLICABLE
3955-38223-0014 HERE THE PROCESS TAKEN IN THE GROSS DOES NOT EVEN BY MECHANICAL NECESSITY SUPPORT THE VALUE WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO GUIDE IT THAT VALUE IS REALISED FOR A MOMENT ONLY
3955-38223-0015 SO THAT IF WE IMPUTE TO CRONOS ANY INTENT TO BEGET HIS CHILDREN WE MUST ALSO IMPUTE TO HIM AN INTENT TO DEVOUR THEM
3955-38223-0016 ABSOLUTE ORDER OR TRUTH IS STATIC IMPOTENT INDIFFERENT OF COURSE THE VARIOUS STATES OF THE WORLD WHEN WE SURVEY THEM RETROSPECTIVELY CONSTITUTE ANOTHER AND NOW STATIC ORDER CALLED HISTORIC TRUTH
3955-38223-0017 TO THIS ABSOLUTE AND IMPOTENT ORDER EVERY DETAIL IS ESSENTIAL IF WE WISHED TO ABUSE LANGUAGE SO MUCH AS TO SPEAK OF WILL IN AN ABSOLUTE WHERE CHANGE IS EXCLUDED
3955-38223-0018 OR BE CONCEIVED BEYOND IT WE MIGHT SAY THAT THE ABSOLUTE WILLED EVERYTHING THAT EVER EXISTS AND THAT THE ETERNAL ORDER TERMINATED IN EVERY FACT INDISCRIMINATELY
3955-38223-0019 ADVENTURES ALL PRE SUPPOSING REFRACTORY MATERIALS AND EXCLUDED FROM ETERNAL TRUTH BY ITS VERY ESSENCE THE ONLY FUNCTION THOSE TRADITIONAL METAPHORS HAVE IS TO SHIELD CONFUSION AND SENTIMENTALITY
3955-38223-0020 BECAUSE JEHOVAH ONCE FOUGHT FOR THE JEWS WE NEED NOT CONTINUE TO SAY THAT THE TRUTH IS SOLICITOUS ABOUT US WHEN IT IS ONLY WE THAT ARE FIGHTING TO ATTAIN IT
3955-38223-0021 THE UNIVERSE CAN WISH PARTICULAR THINGS ONLY IN SO FAR AS PARTICULAR BEINGS WISH THEM ONLY IN ITS RELATIVE CAPACITY CAN IT FIND THINGS GOOD AND ONLY IN ITS RELATIVE CAPACITY CAN IT BE GOOD FOR ANYTHING
3955-38223-0022 MAY ACCORDINGLY BE TERMED A RELATIVE CHAOS A CHAOS BECAUSE THE VALUES SUGGESTED AND SUPPORTED BY THE SECOND MOMENT COULD NOT HAVE BELONGED TO THE FIRST BUT MERELY A RELATIVE CHAOS
3955-38223-0023 FIRST BECAUSE IT PROBABLY CARRIED VALUES OF ITS OWN WHICH RENDERED IT AN ORDER IN A MORAL AND EULOGISTIC SENSE AND SECONDLY BECAUSE IT WAS POTENTIALLY BY VIRTUE OF ITS MOMENTUM A BASIS FOR THE SECOND MOMENT'S VALUES AS WELL
3955-38223-0024 IN EXPERIENCE ORDER IS RELATIVE TO INTERESTS WHICH DETERMINE THE MORAL STATUS OF ALL POWERS HUMAN LIFE WHEN IT BEGINS TO POSSESS INTRINSIC VALUE
3955-38223-0025 IS AN INCIPIENT ORDER IN THE MIDST OF WHAT SEEMS A VAST THOUGH TO SOME EXTENT A VANISHING CHAOS
3955-38223-0026 THIS REPUTED CHAOS CAN BE DECIPHERED AND APPRECIATED BY MAN ONLY IN PROPORTION AS THE ORDER IN HIMSELF IS CONFIRMED AND EXTENDED
3955-38223-0027 FOR MAN'S CONSCIOUSNESS IS EVIDENTLY PRACTICAL IT CLINGS TO HIS FATE REGISTERS SO TO SPEAK THE HIGHER AND LOWER TEMPERATURE OF HIS FORTUNES AND SO FAR AS IT CAN
3955-38223-0028 REPRESENTS THE AGENCIES ON WHICH THOSE FORTUNES DEPEND WHEN THIS DRAMATIC VOCATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS HAS NOT BEEN FULFILLED AT ALL CONSCIOUSNESS IS WHOLLY CONFUSED
3955-38223-0029 THE WORLD IT ENVISAGES SEEMS CONSEQUENTLY A CHAOS LATER IF EXPERIENCE HAS FALLEN INTO SHAPE
3955-38223-0030 THE INFERENCE IS DRAWN THAT THE ORIGINAL DISPOSITION OF THINGS WAS ALSO ORDERLY AND INDEED MECHANICALLY CONDUCIVE TO JUST THOSE FEATS OF INSTINCT AND INTELLIGENCE WHICH HAVE BEEN SINCE ACCOMPLISHED
3955-38223-0031 A THEORY OF ORIGINS OF SUBSTANCE AND OF NATURAL LAWS MAY THUS BE FRAMED AND ACCEPTED AND MAY RECEIVE CONFIRMATION IN THE FURTHER MARCH OF EVENTS IT WILL BE OBSERVED HOWEVER
3955-38223-0032 THAT WHAT IS CREDIBLY ASSERTED ABOUT THE PAST IS NOT A REPORT WHICH THE PAST WAS ITSELF ABLE TO MAKE WHEN IT EXISTED
3955-38223-0033 NOR ONE IT IS NOW ABLE IN SOME ORACULAR FASHION TO FORMULATE AND TO IMPOSE UPON US THE REPORT IS A RATIONAL CONSTRUCTION BASED AND SEATED IN PRESENT EXPERIENCE
3955-38223-0034 IT HAS NO COGENCY FOR THE INATTENTIVE AND NO EXISTENCE FOR THE IGNORANT ALTHOUGH THE UNIVERSE THEN MAY NOT HAVE COME FROM CHAOS HUMAN EXPERIENCE CERTAINLY HAS BEGUN IN A PRIVATE AND DREAMFUL CHAOS OF ITS OWN
3955-38223-0035 OUT OF WHICH IT STILL ONLY PARTIALLY AND MOMENTARILY EMERGES THE HISTORY OF THIS AWAKENING IS OF COURSE NOT THE SAME AS THAT OF THE ENVIRONING WORLD ULTIMATELY DISCOVERED IT IS THE HISTORY HOWEVER
3955-38223-0036 OF THAT DISCOVERY ITSELF OF THE KNOWLEDGE THROUGH WHICH ALONE THE WORLD CAN BE REVEALED
3955-38223-0037 NATURE THE ABSOLUTE AND THE GODS WE SHALL MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE IN DUE SEASON AND BETTER APPRECIATE THEIR MORAL STATUS
3955-38223-0038 THE DISCOVERED CONDITIONS OF REASON NOT ITS BEGINNING TO REVERT TO PRIMORDIAL FEELING IS AN EXERCISE IN MENTAL DISINTEGRATION NOT A FEAT OF SCIENCE WE MIGHT INDEED
3955-38223-0039 AS IN ANIMAL PSYCHOLOGY RETRACE THE SITUATIONS IN WHICH INSTINCT AND SENSE SEEM FIRST TO APPEAR AND WRITE AS IT WERE A GENEALOGY OF REASON BASED ON CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE REASON WAS BORN
3955-38223-0040 AS IT HAS SINCE DISCOVERED INTO A WORLD ALREADY WONDERFULLY ORGANISED IN WHICH IT FOUND ITS PRECURSOR IN WHAT IS CALLED LIFE
3955-38223-0041 ON WHICH THEY DEPEND IT DID NOT ARISE UNTIL THE WILL OR CONSCIOUS STRESS BY WHICH ANY MODIFICATION OF LIVING BODIES INERTIA SEEMS TO BE ACCOMPANIED
3955-38223-0042 BEGAN TO RESPOND TO REPRESENTED OBJECTS AND TO MAINTAIN THAT INERTIA NOT ABSOLUTELY BY RESISTANCE BUT ONLY RELATIVELY AND INDIRECTLY THROUGH LABOUR
3955-38223-0043 REASON HAS THUS SUPERVENED AT THE LAST STAGE OF AN ADAPTATION WHICH HAD LONG BEEN CARRIED ON BY IRRATIONAL AND EVEN UNCONSCIOUS PROCESSES NATURE PRECEDED
3955-38223-0044 SUCH A MATRIX OR CRADLE FOR REASON BELONGS ONLY EXTERNALLY TO ITS LIFE THE DESCRIPTION OF CONDITIONS INVOLVES THEIR PREVIOUS DISCOVERY AND A HISTORIAN EQUIPPED WITH MANY DATA AND MANY ANALOGIES OF THOUGHT
3955-38223-0045 SUCH SCIENTIFIC RESOURCES ARE ABSENT IN THOSE FIRST MOMENTS OF RATIONAL LIVING WHICH WE HERE WISH TO RECALL
