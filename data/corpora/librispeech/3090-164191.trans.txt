3090-164191-0000 PUFFIN BY WAY OF KEEPING UP THE COMEDY OF ROMAN ROADS HAD BROUGHT A MAP OF THE DISTRICT ACROSS FROM HIS HOUSE BUT THE MORE ESSENTIAL PART OF HIS EQUIPMENT FOR THIS STUDIOUS EVENING WAS A BOTTLE OF WHISKY ORIGINALLY THE HOST HAD PROVIDED WHISKY FOR HIMSELF AND HIS GUEST AT THESE PLEASANT CHATS
3090-164191-0001 BUT THERE WERE UNDENIABLE OBJECTIONS TO THIS PLAN BECAUSE THE GUEST ALWAYS PROVED UNUSUALLY THIRSTY WHICH TEMPTED HIS HOST TO KEEP PACE WITH HIM WHILE IF THEY BOTH DRANK AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE THE CAUSES OF ECONOMY AND ABSTEMIOUSNESS HAD A BETTER CHANCE ALSO
3090-164191-0002 PUFFIN ENRICHED HIS WITH LEMONS AND SUGAR IN A LARGE ONE SO THAT NOBODY COULD REALLY TELL IF EQUALITY AS WELL AS FRATERNITY WAS REALIZED BUT IF EACH BROUGHT HIS OWN BOTTLE IT HAD BEEN A TRYING DAY AND THE MAJOR WAS VERY LAME
3090-164191-0003 A DRENCHING STORM HAD COME UP DURING THEIR GOLF WHILE THEY WERE FAR FROM THE CLUB HOUSE AND PUFFIN
3090-164191-0004 HE WAS PERFECTLY WILLING TO BE PAID HIS HALF CROWN AND GO HOME BUT MAJOR FLINT REMEMBERING THAT PUFFIN'S GAME USUALLY WENT TO PIECES IF IT RAINED HAD REJECTED THIS PROPOSAL WITH THE SCORN THAT IT DESERVED THERE HAD BEEN OTHER DISAGREEABLE INCIDENTS AS WELL
3090-164191-0005 HIS DRIVER SLIPPERY FROM RAIN HAD FLOWN OUT OF THE MAJOR'S HANDS ON THE TWELFTH TEE AND HAD SHOT LIKE A STREAMER OF THE NORTHERN MORN
3090-164191-0006 THE GROUND WAS GREASY WITH MOISTURE AND THREE HOLES FARTHER ON PUFFIN HAD FALLEN FLAT ON HIS FACE INSTEAD OF LASHING HIS FIFTH SHOT HOME ON TO THE GREEN AS HE HAD INTENDED THEY HAD GIVEN EACH OTHER STYMIES AND EACH HAD HOLED HIS OPPONENT'S BALL BY MISTAKE
3090-164191-0007 THEY HAD WRANGLED OVER THE CORRECT PROCEDURE IF YOU LAY IN A RABBIT SCRAPE OR ON THE TRAM LINES THE MAJOR HAD LOST A NEW BALL THERE WAS A MUSHROOM ON ONE OF THE GREENS BETWEEN PUFFIN'S BALL AND THE HOLE
3090-164191-0008 ALL THESE UNTOWARD INCIDENTS HAD COME CROWDING IN TOGETHER AND FROM THE MAJOR'S POINT OF VIEW THE WORST OF THEM ALL HAD BEEN THE COLLECTIVE INCIDENT THAT PUFFIN SO FAR FROM BEING PUT OFF BY THE RAIN HAD IN SPITE OF MUSHROOM AND FALLING DOWN
3090-164191-0009 PLAYED WITH A STEADINESS OF WHICH HE WAS USUALLY QUITE INCAPABLE
3090-164191-0010 WAS GROWING IRRITATED WITH HIS COMPANION'S ILL TEMPER AND WAS HALF BLINDED BY WOOD SMOKE HE WIPED HIS STREAMING EYES YOU SHOULD GET YOUR CHIMNEY SWEPT HE OBSERVED MAJOR FLINT HAD PUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF OVER HIS FACE TO KEEP THE WOOD SMOKE OUT OF HIS EYES HE BLEW IT OFF WITH A LOUD INDIGNANT PUFF
3090-164191-0011 OH AH INDEED HE SAID PUFFIN WAS RATHER TAKEN ABACK BY THE VIOLENCE OF THESE INTERJECTIONS THEY DRIPPED WITH ANGRY SARCASM OH WELL NO OFFENCE HE SAID A MAN SAID THE MAJOR IMPERSONALLY MAKES AN OFFENSIVE REMARK AND SAYS NO OFFENCE
3090-164191-0012 IF YOUR OWN FIRESIDE SUITS YOU BETTER THAN MINE CAPTAIN PUFFIN ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT YOU'RE AT LIBERTY TO ENJOY IT THIS WAS ALL RATHER IRREGULAR
3090-164191-0013 PUFFIN PLUCKED AND PROFFERED AN OLIVE
3090-164191-0014 THERE'S YOUR HANDKERCHIEF HE SAID PICKING IT UP NOW LET'S HAVE ONE OF OUR COMFORTABLE TALKS HOT GLASS OF GROG AND A CHAT OVER THE FIRE THAT'S THE BEST THING AFTER SUCH A WETTING AS WE GOT THIS AFTERNOON I'LL TAKE A SLICE OF LEMON IF YOU'LL BE SO GOOD AS TO GIVE IT ME AND A LUMP OF SUGAR
3090-164191-0015 THE MAJOR GOT UP AND LIMPED TO HIS CUPBOARD IT STRUCK HIM PRECISELY AT THAT MOMENT THAT PUFFIN SCORED CONSIDERABLY OVER LEMONS AND SUGAR BECAUSE HE WAS SUPPLIED WITH THEM GRATIS EVERY OTHER NIGHT WHEREAS HE HIMSELF WHEN PUFFIN'S GUEST TOOK NOTHING OFF HIS HOST BUT HOT WATER
3090-164191-0016 I HARDLY KNOW WHETHER THERE'S A LEMON LEFT HE GRUMBLED I MUST LAY IN A STORE OF LEMONS AS FOR SUGAR
3090-164191-0017 AMUSING INCIDENT THE OTHER DAY HE SAID BRIGHTLY
3090-164191-0018 THE OLD LADY DIDN'T LIKE IT DON'T SUPPOSE THE POOR OF THE PARISH WILL SEE MUCH OF THAT CORNED BEEF THE MAJOR BECAME DIGNIFIED PARDON ME HE SAID
3090-164191-0019 I TAKE IT THAT HER STATEMENT IS CORRECT I EXPECT OTHERS OF MY FRIENDS WHILE THEY ARE IN MY PRESENCE TO DO THE SAME I HAVE THE HONOUR TO GIVE YOU A LEMON CAPTAIN PUFFIN AND A SLICE OF SUGAR I SHOULD SAY A LUMP OF SUGAR
3090-164191-0020 THIS DIGNIFIED AND LOFTY MOOD WAS OFTEN ONE OF THE AFTEREFFECTS OF AN UNSUCCESSFUL GAME OF GOLF IT GENERALLY YIELDED QUITE QUICKLY TO A LITTLE STIMULANT PUFFIN FILLED HIS GLASS FROM THE BOTTLE AND THE KETTLE WHILE HIS FRIEND PUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AGAIN OVER HIS FACE
3090-164191-0021 WELL I SHALL JUST HAVE MY GROG BEFORE I TURN IN HE OBSERVED ACCORDING TO CUSTOM AREN'T YOU GOING TO JOIN ME MAJOR PRESENTLY SIR SAID THE MAJOR PUFFIN KNOCKED OUT THE CONSUMED CINDERS IN HIS PIPE AGAINST THE EDGE OF THE FENDER
3090-164191-0022 MAJOR FLINT APPARENTLY WAS WAITING FOR THIS FOR HE WITHDREW HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND CLOSELY WATCHED THE PROCESS A MINUTE PIECE OF ASH FELL FROM PUFFIN'S PIPE ON TO THE HEARTHRUG AND HE JUMPED TO HIS FEET AND REMOVED IT VERY CAREFULLY WITH THE SHOVEL I HAVE YOUR PERMISSION I HOPE HE SAID WITHERINGLY
3090-164191-0023 CERTAINLY CERTAINLY SAID PUFFIN NOW GET YOUR GLASS MAJOR YOU'LL FEEL BETTER IN A MINUTE OR TWO
3090-164191-0024 HE GAVE A LAMENTABLE CRY WHEN HE BEHELD IT BUT I GOT THAT BOTTLE IN ONLY THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY HE SHOUTED AND THERE'S HARDLY A DRINK LEFT IN IT WELL YOU DID YOURSELF PRETTY WELL LAST NIGHT SAID PUFFIN
3090-164191-0025 THOSE SMALL GLASSES OF YOURS IF FREQUENTLY FILLED UP EMPTY A BOTTLE QUICKER THAN YOU SEEM TO REALIZE MOTIVES OF POLICY PREVENTED THE MAJOR FROM RECEIVING THIS WITH THE RESENTMENT THAT WAS PROPER TO IT AND HIS FACE CLEARED
3090-164191-0026 WELL YOU'LL HAVE TO LET ME BORROW FROM YOU TO NIGHT HE SAID GENIALLY AS HE POURED THE REST OF THE CONTENTS OF HIS BOTTLE INTO THE GLASS AH THAT'S MORE THE TICKET
3090-164191-0027 THE PROSPECT OF SPONGING ON PUFFIN WAS MOST EXHILARATING AND HE PUT HIS LARGE SLIPPERED FEET ON TO THE FENDER YES INDEED THAT WAS A HIGHLY AMUSING INCIDENT ABOUT MISS MAPP'S CUPBOARD HE SAID AND WASN'T MISSUS PLAISTOW DOWN ON HER LIKE A KNIFE ABOUT IT
3090-164191-0028 OUR FAIR FRIENDS YOU KNOW HAVE A PRETTY SHARP EYE FOR EACH OTHER'S LITTLE FAILINGS THEY'VE NO SOONER FINISHED ONE SQUABBLE THAN THEY BEGIN ANOTHER THE PERT LITTLE FAIRIES THEY CAN'T SIT AND ENJOY THEMSELVES LIKE TWO OLD CRONIES I COULD TELL YOU OF AND FEEL AT PEACE WITH ALL THE WORLD
3090-164191-0029 HE FINISHED HIS GLASS AT A GULP AND SEEMED MUCH SURPRISED TO FIND IT EMPTY I'LL BE BORROWING A DROP FROM YOU OLD FRIEND HE SAID
3090-164191-0030 BE CAREFUL NOT TO INFLAME IT SAID PUFFIN THANK YE FOR THE WARNING IT'S THIS BEASTLY CLIMATE THAT TOUCHES IT UP A WINTER IN ENGLAND ADDS YEARS ON TO A MAN'S LIFE UNLESS HE TAKES CARE OF HIMSELF
3090-164191-0031 HAVE SOME MORE SUGAR BEFORE LONG THE MAJOR'S HAND WAS MOVING SLOWLY AND INSTINCTIVELY TOWARDS PUFFIN'S WHISKY BOTTLE AGAIN I RECKON THAT BIG GLASS OF YOURS PUFFIN HE SAID HOLDS BETWEEN THREE AND A HALF TIMES TO FOUR TIMES WHAT MY LITTLE TUMBLER HOLDS
3090-164191-0032 OH COME COME SAID THE MAJOR THREE AND A HALF TO FOUR TIMES I SHOULD SAY REPEATED PUFFIN YOU WON'T FIND I'M FAR OUT
3090-164191-0033 ON THE FAR SIDE OF HIS CHAIR THIS SECOND TUMBLER USUALLY MARKED THE MOST CONVIVIAL PERIOD OF THE EVENING
3090-164191-0034 AND THOSE BEING DISPOSED OF THEY VERY CONTENTEDLY TALKED THROUGH THEIR HATS ABOUT PAST PROWESSES AND TOOK A ROSY VIEW OF THE YOUTH AND ENERGY WHICH STILL BEAT IN THEIR VIGOROUS PULSES THEY WOULD BEGIN PERHAPS BY EXTOLLING EACH OTHER
3090-164191-0035 PUFFIN WHEN INFORMED THAT HIS FRIEND WOULD BE FIFTY FOUR NEXT BIRTHDAY FLATLY REFUSED WITHOUT OFFENCE TO BELIEVE IT AND INDEED HE WAS QUITE RIGHT
3090-164191-0036 BECAUSE THE MAJOR WAS IN REALITY FIFTY SIX IN TURN MAJOR FLINT WOULD SAY THAT HIS FRIEND HAD THE FIGURE OF A BOY OF TWENTY WHICH CAUSED PUFFIN PRESENTLY TO FEEL A LITTLE CRAMPED AND TO WANDER NEGLIGENTLY IN FRONT OF THE BIG LOOKING GLASS BETWEEN THE WINDOWS
3090-164191-0037 FOR THE NEXT HALF HOUR THEY WOULD CHIEFLY TALK ABOUT THEMSELVES IN A PLEASANT GLOW OF SELF SATISFACTION MAJOR FLINT LOOKING AT THE VARIOUS IMPLEMENTS AND TROPHIES THAT ADORNED THE ROOM WOULD SUGGEST PUTTING A SPORTING CHALLENGE IN THE TIMES
3090-164191-0038 I'VE HALF A MIND TO DO IT RETIRED MAJOR OF HIS MAJESTY'S FORCES THE KING GOD BLESS HIM AND HE TOOK A SUBSTANTIAL SIP RETIRED MAJOR AGED FIFTY FOUR CHALLENGES ANY GENTLEMAN OF FIFTY YEARS OR OVER FORTY SAID PUFFIN SYCOPHANTICALLY
3090-164191-0039 AS HE THOUGHT OVER WHAT HE WOULD SAY ABOUT HIMSELF WHEN THE OLD MAN HAD FINISHED WELL WE'LL HALVE IT WE'LL SAY FORTY FIVE TO PLEASE YOU PUFFIN LET'S SEE WHERE HAD I GOT TO
3090-164191-0040 A GAME OF GOLF EIGHTEEN HOLES IN THE AFTERNOON AND
3090-164191-0041 HA HA I SHOULDN'T FEEL MUCH ANXIETY AS TO THE RESULT MY CONFOUNDED LEG SAID PUFFIN BUT I KNOW A RETIRED CAPTAIN FROM HIS MAJESTY'S MERCHANT SERVICE THE KING GOD BLESS HIM AGED FIFTY HO HO FIFTY INDEED
3090-164191-0042 SAID THE MAJOR THINKING TO HIMSELF THAT A DRIED UP LITTLE MAN LIKE PUFFIN MIGHT BE AS OLD AS AN EGYPTIAN MUMMY WHO CAN TELL THE AGE OF A KIPPER NOT A DAY LESS MAJOR RETIRED CAPTAIN AGED FIFTY WHO'LL TAKE ON ALL COMERS OF FORTY TWO AND OVER AT A STEEPLECHASE
3090-164191-0043 ROUND OF GOLF BILLIARDS MATCH HOPPING MATCH
3090-164191-0044 NO OBJECTION GENTLEMEN THEN CARRIED MEM CON THIS GASEOUS MOOD ATHLETIC AMATORY OR OTHERWISE THE AMATORY ONES WERE THE WORST USUALLY FADED SLOWLY LIKE THE LIGHT FROM THE SETTING SUN OR AN EXHAUSTED COAL IN THE GRATE
3090-164191-0045 ABOUT THE END OF PUFFIN'S SECOND TUMBLER AND THE GENTLEMEN AFTER THAT WERE USUALLY SOMNOLENT BUT OCCASIONALLY LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR SOME DISAGREEMENT NEXT DAY WHICH THEY WERE TOO SLEEPY TO GO INTO NOW MAJOR FLINT BY THIS TIME WOULD HAVE HAD SOME FIVE SMALL GLASSES OF WHISKY
3090-164191-0046 EQUIVALENT AS HE BITTERLY OBSERVED TO ONE IN PREWAR DAYS AND AS HE MEASURED HIS NEXT WITH EXTREME CARE AND A SLIGHTLY JERKY MOVEMENT WOULD ANNOUNCE IT AS BEING HIS NIGHT CAP THOUGH YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE HAD PLENTY OF NIGHT CAPS ON ALREADY
3090-164191-0047 PUFFIN CORRESPONDINGLY TOOK A THIMBLEFUL MORE THE THIMBLE APPARENTLY BELONGING TO SOME HOUSEWIFE OF ANAK AND AFTER ANOTHER HALF HOUR OF SUDDEN SINGLE SNORES AND STARTINGS AWAKE AGAIN
3090-164191-0048 OF PIPES FREQUENTLY LIT AND IMMEDIATELY GOING OUT THE GUEST STILL PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF COHERENT SPEECH AND VOLUNTARY MOTION IN THE REQUIRED DIRECTION WOULD STUMBLE ACROSS THE DARK COBBLES TO HIS HOUSE
3090-164191-0049 THE TWO WERE PERFECTLY WELL AWARE OF THE SYMPATHETIC INTEREST THAT OLD MAPPY TOOK IN ALL THAT CONCERNED THEM AND THAT SHE HAD AN EYE ON THEIR EVENING SANCES
3090-164191-0050 WAS EVIDENCED BY THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THE CORNER OF HER BLIND IN THE WINDOW OF THE GARDEN ROOM WAS RAISED BETWEEN SAY HALF PAST NINE AND ELEVEN AT NIGHT THEY HAD OFTEN WATCHED WITH GIGGLES THE PENCIL OF LIGHT THAT ESCAPED OBSCURED AT THE LOWER END BY THE
3090-164191-0051 OUTLINE OF OLD MAPPY'S HEAD AND OCCASIONALLY DRANK TO THE GUARDIAN ANGEL GUARDIAN ANGEL IN ANSWER TO DIRECT INQUIRIES HAD BEEN TOLD BY MAJOR BENJY DURING THE LAST MONTH THAT HE WORKED AT HIS DIARIES ON THREE NIGHTS IN THE WEEK AND WENT TO BED EARLY ON THE OTHERS TO THE VAST IMPROVEMENT OF HIS MENTAL GRASP
3090-164191-0052 AND ON SUNDAY NIGHT DEAR MAJOR BENJY ASKED OLD MAPPY IN THE CHARACTER OF GUARDIAN ANGEL I DON'T THINK YOU KNEW MY BELOVED MY REVERED MOTHER MISS ELIZABETH SAID MAJOR BENJY I SPEND SUNDAY EVENING AS WELL WELL
3090-164191-0053 THE VERY NEXT SUNDAY EVENING GUARDIAN ANGEL HAD HEARD THE SOUND OF SINGING SHE COULD NOT CATCH THE WORDS AND ONLY FRAGMENTS OF THE TUNE WHICH REMINDED HER OF THE ROSEATE MORN HATH PASSED AWAY
3090-164191-0054 AND BLAMED HERSELF VERY MUCH FOR EVER HAVING THOUGHT THAT DEAR MAJOR BENJY SHE PEEPED OUT OF HER WINDOW WHEN SHE HAD EXTINGUISHED HER LIGHT BUT FORTUNATELY THE SINGING HAD CEASED TO NIGHT HOWEVER THE EPOCH OF PUFFIN'S SECOND BIG TUMBLER WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY HARMONIOUS DEVELOPMENTS
3090-164191-0055 MAJOR BENJY WAS DETERMINED TO MAKE THE MOST OF THIS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY OF DRINKING HIS FRIEND'S WHISKY AND WHETHER PUFFIN PUT THE BOTTLE ON THE FARTHER SIDE OF HIM OR UNDER HIS CHAIR OR UNDER THE TABLE HE CAME PADDING ROUND IN HIS SLIPPERS AND STANDING NEAR THE AMBUSH WHILE HE TRIED TO INTEREST HIS FRIEND IN TALES OF LOVE OR TIGER
3090-164191-0056 WHEN HE MISTAKENLY THOUGHT HE HAD DONE SO HE HASTILY REFILLED HIS GLASS TAKING UNUSUALLY STIFF DOSES FOR FEAR OF NOT GETTING ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY AND ALTOGETHER OMITTING TO ASK PUFFIN'S LEAVE FOR THESE MARAUDINGS
3090-164191-0057 ACTING ON THE INSTINCT OF THE POLAR BEAR WHO EATS HER BABIES FOR FEAR THAT ANYBODY ELSE SHOULD GET THEM SURREPTITIOUSLY
3090-164191-0058 AND FILLED IT UP TO THE TOP WITH HOT WATER MAKING A MIXTURE OF EXTRAORDINARY POWER SOON AFTER THIS MAJOR FLINT CAME RAMBLING ROUND THE TABLE AGAIN
3090-164191-0059 AMOROUS REMINISCENCES TO NIGHT HAD BEEN THE ACCOMPANIMENT TO PUFFIN'S SECOND TUMBLER DEVILISH FINE WOMAN SHE WAS HE SAID AND THAT WAS THE LAST BENJAMIN FLINT EVER SAW OF HER SHE WENT UP TO THE HILLS NEXT MORNING
3090-164191-0060 BUT THE LAST YOU SAW OF HER JUST NOW WAS ON THE DECK OF THE P AND O AT BOMBAY OBJECTED PUFFIN OR DID SHE GO UP TO THE HILLS ON THE DECK OF THE P AND O WONDERFUL LINE NO SIR SAID BENJAMIN FLINT THAT WAS HELEN
3090-164191-0061 I DON'T KNOW IF I TOLD YOU BY GAD I'VE KICKED THE BOTTLE OVER NO IDEA YOU'D PUT IT THERE HOPE THE CORK'S IN NO HARM IF IT ISN'T SAID PUFFIN BEGINNING ON HIS THIRD MOST FIERY GLASS THE STRENGTH OF IT RATHER ASTONISHED HIM YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY IT'S EMPTY ASKED MAJOR FLINT WHY JUST NOW THERE WAS CLOSE ON A QUARTER OF A BOTTLE LEFT
3090-164191-0062 AS MUCH AS THAT ASKED PUFFIN GLAD TO HEAR IT NOT A DROP LESS YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY WELL IF YOU CAN DRINK THAT AND CAN SAY HIPPOPOTAMUS AFTERWARDS I SHOULD PUT THAT AMONG YOUR CHALLENGES TO MEN OF FOUR HUNDRED AND TWO I SHOULD SAY FORTY TWO
3090-164191-0063 IT'S A FINE THING TO HAVE A STRONG HEAD THOUGH IF I DRANK WHAT YOU'VE GOT IN YOUR GLASS I SHOULD BE TIPSY SIR PUFFIN LAUGHED IN HIS IRRITATING FALSETTO MANNER GOOD THING THAT IT'S IN MY GLASS THEN AND NOT YOUR GLASS HE SAID AND LEMME TELL YOU MAJOR
3090-164191-0064 IN CASE YOU DON'T KNOW IT THAT WHEN I'VE DRUNK EVERY DROP OF THIS AND SUCKED THE LEMON YOU'LL HAVE HAD FAR MORE OUT OF MY BOTTLE THIS EVENING THAN I HAVE MY USUAL TWICE AND AND MY USUAL NIGHT CAP AS YOU SAY IS WHAT'S MY RATION AND I'VE HAD NO MORE THAN MY RATION
3090-164191-0065 EIGHT BELLS AND A PRETTY GOOD RATION YOU'VE GOT THERE SAID THE BAFFLED MAJOR WITHOUT YOUR USUAL TWICE PUFFIN WAS BEGINNING TO BE AWARE OF THAT AS HE SWALLOWED THE FIERY MIXTURE
3090-164191-0066 WAS CLEAR TO HIM AMONG SO MUCH THAT WAS DIM OWING TO THE WOOD SMOKE THAT THE MAJOR WOULD MISS A GOOD MANY DRIVES TO MORROW MORNING AND WHOSE WHISKY IS IT HE SAID GULPING DOWN THE FIERY STUFF I KNOW WHOSE IT'S GOING TO BE SAID THE OTHER
3090-164191-0067 MAJOR FLINT WAS CONSCIOUS OF AN
3090-164191-0068 IT PLEASED HIM TO THINK THAT HE HAD DRUNK SO MUCH OF SOMEBODY ELSE'S WHISKY BUT HE FELT THAT HE OUGHT TO BE ANGRY THAT'S A VERY UNMENTIONABLE SOR OF THING TO SAY HE REMARKED AN IF IT WASN'T FOR THE SACRED CLAIMS OF HOSPITALITY
3090-164191-0069 PUFFIN FINISHED HIS GLASS AT A GULP AND ROSE TO HIS FEET POLOGIES BE BLOWED HE SAID HITTOPOPAMUS
3090-164191-0070 OF COURSE I WAS HIPPOT
3090-164191-0071 PLEASANT OLD BOY AND AS FOR THE LEMON YOU LENT ME WELL I DON'T WANT IT ANY MORE HAVE A SUCK AT IT OLE FELLOW I DON'T WANT IT ANY MORE THE MAJOR TURNED PURPLE IN THE FACE MADE A COURSE FOR THE DOOR LIKE A KNIGHT'S MOVE AT CHESS A LONG STEP IN ONE DIRECTION AND A SHORT ONE AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE FIRST AND OPENED IT
3090-164191-0072 CAPTAIN PUFFIN STOOD FOR A MOMENT WREATHED IN SMILES AND FINGERING THE SLICE OF LEMON WHICH HE HAD MEANT PLAYFULLY TO THROW AT HIS FRIEND BUT HIS SMILE FADED
3090-164191-0073 AND BY SOME SORT OF TELEPATHIC PERCEPTION HE REALIZED HOW MUCH MORE DECOROUS IT WAS TO SAY OR BETTER TO INDICATE GOODNIGHT IN A DIGNIFIED MANNER THAN TO THROW LEMONS ABOUT HE WALKED IN DOTS AND DASHES LIKE A MORSE CODE OUT OF THE ROOM BESTOWING A NAVAL SALUTE ON THE MAJOR AS HE PASSED
3090-164191-0074 THEN CAPTAIN PUFFIN FOUND HIS HAT AND COAT WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY AND MARCHED OUT OF THE HOUSE SLAMMING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM WITH A BANG THAT ECHOED DOWN THE STREET AND MADE MISS MAPP DREAM ABOUT A THUNDERSTORM HE LET HIMSELF INTO HIS OWN HOUSE AND BENT DOWN BEFORE HIS EXPIRED FIRE
3090-164191-0075 WHICH HE TRIED TO BLOW INTO LIFE AGAIN THIS WAS UNSUCCESSFUL AND HE BREATHED IN A QUANTITY OF WOOD ASH HE SAT DOWN BY HIS TABLE AND BEGAN TO THINK THINGS OUT
3090-164191-0076 WHICH SEEMED TO PRODUCE MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS INTOXICATION ALLOWING FOR THAT HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS EXTREMELY ANGRY ABOUT SOMETHING AND HAD A FIRM IDEA THAT THE MAJOR WAS VERY ANGRY TOO
3090-164191-0077 ALL BEEN ABOUT HE VAINLY ASKED HIMSELF
3090-164191-0078 BUT WHICHEVER IT WAS A LETTER HAD BEEN SLIPPED INTO HIS BOX AND HE BROUGHT IT IN THE GUM ON THE ENVELOPE WAS STILL WET WHICH SAVED TROUBLE IN OPENING IT INSIDE WAS A HALF SHEET CONTAINING BUT A FEW WORDS THIS CURT EPISTLE RAN AS FOLLOWS SIR
3090-164191-0079 MY SECONDS WILL WAIT ON YOU IN THE COURSE OF TO MORROW MORNING YOUR FAITHFUL OBEDIENT SERVANT BENJAMIN FLINT CAPTAIN PUFFIN
3090-164191-0080 SOMEWHERE BELOW HIS COURAGE AND HIS CALM WAS AN APPALLING SENSE OF MISGIVING THAT HE SUCCESSFULLY STIFLED
3090-164191-0081 INSULTS BLOOD SECONDS WON'T HAVE TO WAIT A SECOND BETTER GET A GOOD SLEEP
