3871-692-0000 CHAPTER SIX A LACERATION IN THE COTTAGE HE CERTAINLY WAS REALLY GRIEVED IN A WAY HE HAD SELDOM BEEN BEFORE HE HAD RUSHED IN LIKE A FOOL AND MEDDLED IN WHAT IN A LOVE AFFAIR
3871-692-0001 BUT WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT IT WHAT CAN I TELL ABOUT SUCH THINGS HE REPEATED TO HIMSELF FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME FLUSHING CRIMSON OH BEING ASHAMED WOULD BE NOTHING SHAME IS ONLY THE PUNISHMENT I DESERVE
3871-692-0002 THE TROUBLE IS I SHALL CERTAINLY HAVE CAUSED MORE UNHAPPINESS AND FATHER ZOSSIMA SENT ME TO RECONCILE AND BRING THEM TOGETHER IS THIS THE WAY TO BRING THEM TOGETHER THEN HE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED HOW HE HAD TRIED TO JOIN THEIR HANDS
3871-692-0003 AND HE FELT FEARFULLY ASHAMED AGAIN THOUGH I ACTED QUITE SINCERELY I MUST BE MORE SENSIBLE IN THE FUTURE HE CONCLUDED SUDDENLY AND DID NOT EVEN SMILE AT HIS CONCLUSION KATERINA
3871-692-0004 IVANOVNA'S COMMISSION TOOK HIM TO LAKE STREET AND HIS BROTHER DMITRI LIVED CLOSE BY IN A TURNING OUT OF LAKE STREET ALYOSHA DECIDED TO GO TO HIM IN ANY CASE BEFORE GOING TO THE CAPTAIN THOUGH HE HAD A PRESENTIMENT THAT HE WOULD NOT FIND HIS BROTHER
3871-692-0005 HE SUSPECTED THAT HE WOULD INTENTIONALLY KEEP OUT OF HIS WAY NOW BUT HE MUST FIND HIM ANYHOW TIME WAS PASSING THE THOUGHT OF HIS DYING ELDER HAD NOT LEFT ALYOSHA FOR ONE MINUTE FROM THE TIME HE SET OFF FROM THE MONASTERY
3871-692-0006 THERE WAS ONE POINT WHICH INTERESTED HIM PARTICULARLY ABOUT KATERINA IVANOVNA'S COMMISSION WHEN SHE HAD MENTIONED THE CAPTAIN'S SON THE LITTLE SCHOOLBOY WHO HAD RUN BESIDE HIS FATHER CRYING
3871-692-0007 THE IDEA HAD AT ONCE STRUCK ALYOSHA THAT THIS MUST BE THE SCHOOLBOY WHO HAD BITTEN HIS FINGER WHEN HE ALYOSHA ASKED HIM WHAT HE HAD DONE TO HURT HIM NOW ALYOSHA FELT PRACTICALLY CERTAIN OF THIS
3871-692-0008 THOUGH HE COULD NOT HAVE SAID WHY THINKING OF ANOTHER SUBJECT WAS A RELIEF AND HE RESOLVED TO THINK NO MORE ABOUT THE MISCHIEF HE HAD DONE AND NOT TO TORTURE HIMSELF WITH REMORSE BUT TO DO WHAT HE HAD TO DO LET COME WHAT WOULD
3871-692-0009 AT THAT THOUGHT HE WAS COMPLETELY COMFORTED TURNING TO THE STREET WHERE DMITRI LODGED HE FELT HUNGRY AND TAKING OUT OF HIS POCKET THE ROLL HE HAD BROUGHT FROM HIS FATHER'S HE ATE IT IT MADE HIM FEEL STRONGER
3871-692-0010 DMITRI WAS NOT AT HOME THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE AN OLD CABINET MAKER HIS SON AND HIS OLD WIFE LOOKED WITH POSITIVE SUSPICION AT ALYOSHA
3871-692-0011 THE OLD MAN SAID IN ANSWER TO ALYOSHA'S PERSISTENT INQUIRIES ALYOSHA SAW THAT HE WAS ANSWERING IN ACCORDANCE WITH INSTRUCTIONS WHEN HE ASKED WHETHER HE WERE NOT AT GRUSHENKA'S OR IN HIDING AT FOMA'S ALYOSHA SPOKE SO FREELY
3871-692-0012 ON PURPOSE ALL THREE LOOKED AT HIM IN ALARM THEY ARE FOND OF HIM THEY ARE DOING THEIR BEST FOR HIM THOUGHT ALYOSHA THAT'S GOOD AT LAST HE FOUND THE HOUSE IN LAKE STREET IT WAS A DECREPIT LITTLE HOUSE
3871-692-0013 SUNK ON ONE SIDE WITH THREE WINDOWS LOOKING INTO THE STREET AND WITH A MUDDY YARD IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH STOOD A SOLITARY COW HE CROSSED THE YARD AND FOUND THE DOOR OPENING INTO THE PASSAGE
3871-692-0014 ON THE LEFT OF THE PASSAGE LIVED THE OLD WOMAN OF THE HOUSE WITH HER OLD DAUGHTER BOTH SEEMED TO BE DEAF IN ANSWER TO HIS REPEATED INQUIRY FOR THE CAPTAIN ONE OF THEM AT LAST UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS ASKING FOR THEIR LODGERS
3871-692-0015 AND POINTED TO A DOOR ACROSS THE PASSAGE THE CAPTAIN'S LODGING TURNED OUT TO BE A SIMPLE COTTAGE ROOM ALYOSHA HAD HIS HAND ON THE IRON LATCH TO OPEN THE DOOR
3871-692-0016 YET HE KNEW FROM KATERINA IVANOVNA'S WORDS THAT THE MAN HAD A FAMILY EITHER THEY ARE ALL ASLEEP OR PERHAPS THEY HAVE HEARD ME COMING AND ARE WAITING FOR ME TO OPEN THE DOOR I'D BETTER KNOCK FIRST AND HE KNOCKED
3871-692-0017 AN ANSWER CAME BUT NOT AT ONCE AFTER AN INTERVAL OF PERHAPS TEN SECONDS WHO'S THERE SHOUTED SOME ONE IN A LOUD AND VERY ANGRY VOICE THEN ALYOSHA OPENED THE DOOR AND CROSSED THE THRESHOLD
3871-692-0018 HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A REGULAR PEASANT'S ROOM THOUGH IT WAS LARGE IT WAS CUMBERED UP WITH DOMESTIC BELONGINGS OF ALL SORTS AND THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE IN IT ON THE LEFT WAS A LARGE RUSSIAN STOVE FROM THE STOVE TO THE WINDOW ON THE LEFT
3871-692-0019 AND ON IT THERE WERE RAGS HANGING THERE WAS A BEDSTEAD AGAINST THE WALL ON EACH SIDE RIGHT AND LEFT COVERED WITH KNITTED QUILTS ON THE ONE ON THE LEFT WAS A PYRAMID OF FOUR PRINT COVERED PILLOWS
3871-692-0020 EACH SMALLER THAN THE ONE BENEATH ON THE OTHER THERE WAS ONLY ONE VERY SMALL PILLOW THE OPPOSITE CORNER WAS SCREENED OFF BY A CURTAIN OR A SHEET HUNG ON A STRING BEHIND THIS CURTAIN COULD BE SEEN A BED
3871-692-0021 MADE UP ON A BENCH AND A CHAIR THE ROUGH SQUARE TABLE OF PLAIN WOOD HAD BEEN MOVED INTO THE MIDDLE WINDOW
3871-692-0022 GAVE LITTLE LIGHT AND WERE CLOSE SHUT SO THAT THE ROOM WAS NOT VERY LIGHT AND RATHER STUFFY ON THE TABLE WAS A FRYING PAN WITH THE REMAINS OF SOME FRIED EGGS A HALF EATEN PIECE OF BREAD
3871-692-0023 AND A SMALL BOTTLE WITH A FEW DROPS OF VODKA A WOMAN OF GENTEEL APPEARANCE WEARING A COTTON GOWN WAS SITTING ON A CHAIR BY THE BED ON THE LEFT HER FACE WAS THIN AND YELLOW AND HER SUNKEN CHEEKS
3871-692-0024 BETRAYED AT THE FIRST GLANCE THAT SHE WAS ILL BUT WHAT STRUCK ALYOSHA MOST WAS THE EXPRESSION IN THE POOR WOMAN'S EYES A LOOK OF SURPRISED INQUIRY AND YET OF HAUGHTY PRIDE
3871-692-0025 AND WHILE HE WAS TALKING TO HER HUSBAND HER BIG BROWN EYES MOVED FROM ONE SPEAKER TO THE OTHER WITH THE SAME HAUGHTY AND QUESTIONING EXPRESSION BESIDE HER AT THE WINDOW STOOD A YOUNG GIRL RATHER PLAIN
3871-692-0026 WITH SCANTY REDDISH HAIR POORLY BUT VERY NEATLY DRESSED SHE LOOKED DISDAINFULLY AT ALYOSHA AS HE CAME IN BESIDE THE OTHER BED WAS SITTING ANOTHER FEMALE FIGURE SHE WAS A VERY SAD SIGHT
3871-692-0027 A YOUNG GIRL OF ABOUT TWENTY BUT HUNCHBACK AND CRIPPLED WITH WITHERED LEGS AS ALYOSHA WAS TOLD AFTERWARDS HER CRUTCHES STOOD IN THE CORNER CLOSE BY THE STRIKINGLY BEAUTIFUL AND GENTLE EYES OF THIS POOR GIRL
3871-692-0028 LOOKED WITH MILD SERENITY AT ALYOSHA A MAN OF FORTY FIVE WAS SITTING AT THE TABLE FINISHING THE FRIED EGGS HE WAS SPARE SMALL AND WEAKLY BUILT HE HAD REDDISH HAIR
3871-692-0029 AND A SCANTY LIGHT COLORED BEARD VERY MUCH LIKE A WISP OF TOW THIS COMPARISON AND THE PHRASE A WISP OF TOW FLASHED AT ONCE INTO ALYOSHA'S MIND FOR SOME REASON HE REMEMBERED IT AFTERWARDS
3871-692-0030 IT WAS OBVIOUSLY THIS GENTLEMAN WHO HAD SHOUTED TO HIM AS THERE WAS NO OTHER MAN IN THE ROOM BUT WHEN ALYOSHA WENT IN HE LEAPT UP FROM THE BENCH ON WHICH HE WAS SITTING AND HASTILY WIPING HIS MOUTH WITH A RAGGED NAPKIN
3871-692-0031 DARTED UP TO ALYOSHA IT'S A MONK COME TO BEG FOR THE MONASTERY A NICE PLACE TO COME TO THE GIRL STANDING IN THE LEFT CORNER SAID ALOUD THE MAN SPUN ROUND INSTANTLY TOWARDS HER AND ANSWERED HER IN AN EXCITED
3871-692-0032 AND BREAKING VOICE NO VARVARA YOU ARE WRONG ALLOW ME TO ASK HE TURNED AGAIN TO ALYOSHA WHAT HAS BROUGHT YOU TO OUR RETREAT ALYOSHA LOOKED ATTENTIVELY AT HIM
3871-692-0033 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD SEEN HIM THERE WAS SOMETHING ANGULAR FLURRIED AND IRRITABLE ABOUT HIM THOUGH HE HAD OBVIOUSLY JUST BEEN DRINKING HE WAS NOT DRUNK
3871-692-0034 AND YET STRANGE TO SAY AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS FEAR HE LOOKED LIKE A MAN WHO HAD LONG BEEN KEPT IN SUBJECTION AND HAD SUBMITTED TO IT AND NOW
3871-692-0035 HAD SUDDENLY TURNED AND WAS TRYING TO ASSERT HIMSELF OR BETTER STILL LIKE A MAN WHO WANTS DREADFULLY TO HIT YOU BUT IS HORRIBLY AFRAID YOU WILL HIT HIM
3871-692-0036 IN HIS WORDS AND IN THE INTONATION OF HIS SHRILL VOICE THERE WAS A SORT OF CRAZY HUMOR AT TIMES SPITEFUL AND AT TIMES CRINGING AND CONTINUALLY SHIFTING FROM ONE TONE TO ANOTHER
3871-692-0037 THE QUESTION ABOUT OUR RETREAT HE HAD ASKED AS IT WERE QUIVERING ALL OVER ROLLING HIS EYES AND SKIPPING UP SO CLOSE TO ALYOSHA THAT HE INSTINCTIVELY DREW BACK A STEP
3871-692-0038 HE WAS DRESSED IN A VERY SHABBY DARK COTTON COAT PATCHED AND SPOTTED HE WORE CHECKED TROUSERS OF AN EXTREMELY LIGHT COLOR LONG OUT OF FASHION AND OF VERY THIN MATERIAL THEY WERE SO CRUMPLED
3871-692-0039 AND SO SHORT THAT HE LOOKED AS THOUGH HE HAD GROWN OUT OF THEM LIKE A BOY I AM ALEXEY KARAMAZOV ALYOSHA BEGAN IN REPLY I QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT SIR THE GENTLEMAN SNAPPED OUT AT ONCE TO ASSURE HIM
3871-692-0040 THAT HE KNEW WHO HE WAS ALREADY I AM CAPTAIN SNEGIRYOV SIR BUT I AM STILL DESIROUS TO KNOW PRECISELY WHAT HAS LED YOU OH I'VE COME FOR NOTHING SPECIAL I WANTED TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU IF ONLY YOU ALLOW ME

3871-692-0042 THEN TAKING ANOTHER SIMILAR CHAIR FOR HIMSELF HE SAT DOWN FACING ALYOSHA SO CLOSE TO HIM THAT THEIR KNEES ALMOST TOUCHED
3871-692-0043 SNEGIRYOV SIR FORMERLY A CAPTAIN IN THE RUSSIAN INFANTRY PUT TO SHAME FOR HIS VICES BUT STILL A CAPTAIN THOUGH I MIGHT NOT BE ONE NOW FOR THE WAY I TALK FOR THE LAST HALF OF MY LIFE I'VE LEARNT TO SAY SIR
