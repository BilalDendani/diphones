8228-232690-0000 FOR I KNOW THAT HE GRANTETH UNTO MEN ACCORDING TO THEIR DESIRE
8228-232690-0001 AND IF HE ROBBED HE WAS ALSO PUNISHED AND IF HE STOLE HE WAS ALSO PUNISHED AND IF HE COMMITTED ADULTERY HE WAS ALSO PUNISHED
8228-232690-0002 NEVERTHELESS THERE WAS NO LAW AGAINST A MAN'S BELIEF THEREFORE A MAN WAS PUNISHED ONLY FOR THE CRIMES WHICH HE HAD DONE
8228-232690-0003 AND THE LAW COULD HAVE NO HOLD UPON HIM BEGAN TO PREACH UNTO THE PEOPLE THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO CHRIST
8228-232690-0004 WHY DO YE YOKE YOURSELVES WITH SUCH FOOLISH THINGS WHY DO YE LOOK FOR A CHRIST
8228-232690-0005 WHICH YE SAY ARE HANDED DOWN BY HOLY PROPHETS
8228-232690-0006 BEHOLD YE CANNOT KNOW OF THINGS WHICH YE DO NOT SEE
8228-232690-0007 BUT BEHOLD IT IS THE EFFECT OF A FRENZIED MIND AND THIS DERANGEMENT OF YOUR MINDS COMES BECAUSE OF THE TRADITIONS OF YOUR FATHERS
8228-232690-0008 TELLING THEM THAT THERE COULD BE NO ATONEMENT MADE FOR THE SINS OF MEN BUT EVERY MAN FARED IN THIS LIFE ACCORDING TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE CREATURE THEREFORE EVERY MAN PROSPERED ACCORDING TO HIS GENIUS AND THAT EVERY MAN CONQUERED ACCORDING TO HIS STRENGTH
8228-232690-0009 LEADING AWAY THE HEARTS OF MANY CAUSING THEM TO LIFT UP THEIR HEADS IN THEIR WICKEDNESS YEA LEADING AWAY MANY WOMEN AND ALSO MEN TO COMMIT WHOREDOMS
8228-232690-0010 FOR THEY TOOK HIM AND BOUND HIM AND CARRIED HIM BEFORE AMMON
8228-232690-0011 AND HE CAME OVER INTO THE LAND OF GIDEON AND BEGAN TO PREACH UNTO THEM ALSO AND HERE HE DID NOT HAVE MUCH SUCCESS FOR HE WAS TAKEN AND BOUND AND CARRIED BEFORE THE HIGH PRIEST
8228-232690-0012 WHY DO YE GO ABOUT PERVERTING THE WAYS OF THE LORD WHY DO YE TEACH THIS PEOPLE THAT THERE SHALL BE NO CHRIST TO INTERRUPT THEIR REJOICINGS
8228-232690-0013 AND KORIHOR SAID UNTO HIM BECAUSE I DO NOT TEACH THE FOOLISH TRADITIONS OF YOUR FATHERS
8228-232690-0014 UNDER THE FOOLISH ORDINANCES AND PERFORMANCES WHICH ARE LAID DOWN BY ANCIENT PRIESTS TO USURP POWER AND AUTHORITY OVER THEM TO KEEP THEM IN IGNORANCE THAT THEY MAY NOT LIFT UP THEIR HEADS
8228-232690-0015 BEHOLD I SAY THEY ARE IN BONDAGE
8228-232690-0016 BECAUSE OF THE TRANSGRESSION OF A PARENT
8228-232690-0017 THAT CHRIST SHALL COME BUT BEHOLD I SAY THAT YE DO NOT KNOW THAT THERE SHALL BE A CHRIST
8228-232690-0018 AND ACCORDING TO YOUR OWN DESIRES AND YE KEEP THEM DOWN EVEN AS IT WERE IN BONDAGE THAT YE MAY GLUT YOURSELVES WITH THE LABORS OF THEIR HANDS
8228-232690-0019 LEST THEY SHOULD OFFEND THEIR PRIESTS WHO DO YOKE THEM ACCORDING TO THEIR DESIRES AND HAVE BROUGHT THEM TO BELIEVE BY THEIR TRADITIONS AND THEIR DREAMS AND THEIR WHIMS AND THEIR VISIONS AND THEIR PRETENDED MYSTERIES
8228-232690-0020 OFFEND SOME UNKNOWN BEING WHO THEY SAY IS GOD
8228-232690-0021 YEA WHEN THEY SAW THAT HE WOULD REVILE EVEN AGAINST GOD THEY WOULD NOT MAKE ANY REPLY TO HIS WORDS BUT THEY CAUSED THAT HE SHOULD BE BOUND AND THEY DELIVERED HIM UP INTO THE HANDS OF THE OFFICERS AND SENT HIM TO THE LAND OF ZARAHEMLA
8228-232690-0022 THAT HE MIGHT BE BROUGHT BEFORE ALMA AND THE CHIEF JUDGE
8228-232690-0023 AND THE CHIEF JUDGE HE DID GO ON IN THE SAME MANNER AS HE DID IN THE LAND OF GIDEON
8228-232690-0024 AND DID REVILE AGAINST THE PRIESTS AND TEACHERS ACCUSING THEM OF LEADING AWAY THE PEOPLE AFTER THE SILLY TRADITIONS OF THEIR FATHERS
