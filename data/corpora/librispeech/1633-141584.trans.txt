1633-141584-0012 WITH HIS TAIL CARRIED GAILY OVER HIS BACK AS IF HE HAD NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF BUT FIDO WALKED HOME VERY SORRY INDEED HIS LITTLE HEART WAS BROKEN TO THINK THAT HE HAD CAUSED RAGGEDY ANN TO BE DROWNED
1633-141584-0013 BUT RAGGEDY ANN DIDN'T DROWN NOT A BIT OF IT IN FACT SHE EVEN WENT TO SLEEP ON THE BROOK FOR THE MOTION OF THE CURRENT WAS VERY SOOTHING AS IT CARRIED HER ALONG JUST LIKE BEING ROCKED BY MARCELLA
1633-141584-0014 SO SLEEPING PEACEFULLY RAGGEDY ANN DRIFTED ALONG WITH THE CURRENT UNTIL SHE CAME TO A POOL WHERE SHE LODGED AGAINST A LARGE STONE RAGGEDY ANN TRIED TO CLIMB UPON THE STONE
1633-141584-0015 BUT BY THIS TIME THE WATER HAD THOROUGHLY SOAKED THROUGH RAGGEDY ANN'S NICE CLEAN WHITE COTTON STUFFING AND SHE WAS SO HEAVY SHE COULD NOT CLIMB SO THERE SHE HAD TO STAY UNTIL MARCELLA AND DADDY CAME ALONG AND FOUND HER
