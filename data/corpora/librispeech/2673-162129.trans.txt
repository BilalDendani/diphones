2673-162129-0000 YET THAT IN DEMOCRACY ITSELF THERE IS NO INHERENT OPPOSITION TO LIBERTY THE DANGER TO INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY IN A DEMOCRACY
2673-162129-0001 IT IS EQUALLY POSSIBLE FOR THE GOVERNING POWER ON THE ONE HAND TO RESPECT OR ON THE OTHER HAND TO IGNORE THE RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS TO THE FREE PLAY OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL POWERS THE EXERCISE OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL PREDILECTIONS
2673-162129-0002 THE LEADING OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL LIVES ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN NOTIONS OF WHAT IS RIGHT OR DESIRABLE A MONARCH OF ENLIGHTENED AND LIBERAL MIND WILL RESPECT THAT RIGHT
2673-162129-0003 AND LIMIT HIS ENCROACHMENTS UPON IT TO THE MINIMUM REQUIRED FOR THE ESSENTIAL OBJECTS OF REASONABLE GOVERNMENT SO TOO WILL A DEMOCRACY IF IT IS OF LIKE TEMPER AND INTELLIGENCE BUT IT IS NOT SO WITH SOCIALISM
2673-162129-0004 NUMEROUS AS ARE THE VARIETIES OF SOCIALISM THEY ALL AGREE IN BEING INHERENTLY ANTAGONISTIC TO INDIVIDUALISM IT MAY BE PLEADED IN CRITICISM OF THIS ASSERTION
2673-162129-0005 THAT ALL GOVERNMENT IS OPPOSED TO INDIVIDUALISM THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS RESPECT BETWEEN SOCIALISM AND OTHER FORMS OF CIVIL ORGANIZATION IS ONLY ONE OF DEGREE THAT WE MAKE A SURRENDER OF INDIVIDUALITY
2673-162129-0006 AS WELL AS OF LIBERTY WHEN WE CONSENT TO LIVE IN ANY ORGANIZED FORM OF SOCIETY IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE TO DISPUTE THE POINT THE DIFFERENCE MAY IF ONE CHOOSES BE REGARDED AS ONLY A DIFFERENCE OF DEGREE
2673-162129-0007 EQUIVALENT TO A DIFFERENCE OF KIND SOCIALISM IS IN ITS VERY ESSENCE OPPOSED TO INDIVIDUALISM IT MAKES THE COLLECTIVE WELFARE NOT AN INCIDENTAL CONCERN OF EACH MAN'S DAILY LIFE
2673-162129-0008 BUT HIS PRIMARY CONCERN THE STANDARD IT SETS UP THE REGULATIONS IT ESTABLISHES ARE NOT THINGS THAT A MAN MUST MERELY TAKE ACCOUNT OF AS SPECIAL RESTRAINTS ON HIS FREEDOM
2673-162129-0009 EXCEPTIONAL LIMITATIONS ON THE EXERCISE OF HIS INDIVIDUALITY THEY CONSTITUTE THE BASIC CONDITIONS OF HIS LIFE WHEN THE SOCIALIST MOVEMENT WAS IN ITS INFANCY IN THIS COUNTRY
2673-162129-0010 THOUGH IT HAD MADE GREAT HEADWAY IN SEVERAL OF THE LEADING COUNTRIES OF EUROPE THE CUSTOMARY WAY OF DISPOSING OF IT WAS WITH A MERE WAVE OF THE HAND SOCIALISM CAN NEVER WORK IT IS CONTRARY TO HUMAN NATURE
2673-162129-0011 YET I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT A VERY LARGE PROPORTION OF THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO SOCIALISM ARE STILL CONTENT WITH THIS WAY OF DISPOSING OF IT BUT SOCIALISM HAS STEADILY THOUGH OF COURSE WITH FLUCTUATIONS
2673-162129-0012 INCREASED IN STRENGTH IN AMERICA AS WELL AS IN EUROPE FOR MANY DECADES AND IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO IMAGINE THAT MERE DECLARATIONS OF ITS BEING IMPRACTICABLE OR CONTRARY TO HUMAN NATURE WILL SUFFICE TO CHECK IT
2673-162129-0013 MILLIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN HERE IN AMERICA RANGING IN INTELLECT ALL THE WAY FROM THE MOST CULTURED TO THE MOST IGNORANT ARE FILLED WITH AN ARDENT FAITH THAT IN SOCIALISM AND IN NOTHING ELSE
2673-162129-0014 IS TO BE FOUND THE REMEDY FOR ALL THE GREAT EVILS UNDER WHICH MANKIND SUFFERS AND THERE IS NO SIGN OF SLACKENING IN THE GROWTH OF THIS FAITH WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR A REAL TEST OF ITS STRENGTH
2673-162129-0015 IT IS ABSURD TO SUPPOSE THAT THOSE WHO ARE INCLINED TO WELCOME IT AS THE SALVATION OF THE WORLD WILL BE FRIGHTENED OFF BY PROPHECIES OF FAILURE THEY WILL WANT TO MAKE THE TRIAL
2673-162129-0016 AND THEY WILL MAKE THE TRIAL REGARDLESS OF ALL PROPHECIES OF DISASTER IF THE PEOPLE SHALL HAVE COME TO BELIEVE THAT THE OBJECT IS A DESIRABLE ONE THAT SOCIALISM IS A FORM OF LIFE WHICH THEY WOULD LIKE AFTER THEY GOT IT
2673-162129-0017 THE ONE GREAT BULWARK AGAINST SOCIALISM IS THE SENTIMENT OF LIBERTY IF WE FIND NOTHING OBNOXIOUS IN UNIVERSAL REGIMENTATION
2673-162129-0018 IF WE FEEL THAT LIFE WOULD HAVE AS MUCH SAVOR WHEN ALL OF US WERE TOLD OFF TO OUR TASKS OR AT LEAST CIRCUMSCRIBED AND SUPERVISED IN OUR ACTIVITIES BY A SWARM OF OFFICIALS CARRYING OUT THE BENEVOLENT EDICTS OF A PATERNAL GOVERNMENT
2673-162129-0019 IF WE HOLD AS OF NO ACCOUNT THE EXERCISE OF INDIVIDUAL CHOICE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF INDIVIDUAL POTENTIALITIES WHICH ARE THE VERY LIFEBLOOD OF THE EXISTING ORDER OF SOCIETY IF ALL THESE THINGS HOLD NO VALUE FOR US
2673-162129-0020 THEN WE SHALL GRAVITATE TO SOCIALISM AS SURELY AS A RIVER WILL FIND ITS WAY TO THE SEA SOCIALISM GRANTED ITS PRACTICABILITY AND ITS PRACTICABILITY CAN NEVER BE DISPROVED EXCEPT BY TRIAL
2673-162129-0021 BY LONG AND REPEATED TRIAL HOLDS OUT THE PROMISE OF GREAT BLESSINGS TO MANKIND AND SOME OF THESE BLESSINGS IT IS ACTUALLY CAPABLE OF FURNISHING EVEN IF IN THE END IT SHOULD PROVE TO BE A FAILURE
2673-162129-0022 ABOVE ALL IT COULD COMPLETELY ABOLISH POVERTY THAT IS ANYTHING LIKE ABJECT POVERTY THE PRODUCTIVE POWER OF MANKIND THANKS TO THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE AND INVENTION
2673-162129-0023 IS NOW SO GREAT THAT EVEN IF SOCIALISM WERE TO BRING ABOUT A VERY GREAT DECLINE OF PRODUCTIVENESS NOT TO BE SURE SUCH UTTER BLASTING OF PRODUCTIVENESS AS HAS BEEN CAUSED BY THE BOLSHEVIK INSANITY
2673-162129-0024 BY EQUAL DISTRIBUTION THE SIMPLE NEEDS OF ALL THE PEOPLE BESIDES THE ABOLITION OF POVERTY THERE WOULD BE THE EXTINCTION OF MANY SINISTER FORMS OF COMPETITIVE GREED AND DISHONESTY TO THE EYE OF THE THINKING CONSERVATIVE
2673-162129-0025 THESE THINGS POVERTY GREED DISHONESTY WHILE SERIOUS EVILS ARE BUT THE BLEMISHES IN A GREAT AND WHOLESOME SCHEME OF HUMAN LIFE DRAWBACKS WHICH GO WITH THE BENEFITS OF A SYSTEM IN WHICH EACH MAN IS FREE
2673-162129-0026 THE MATTER PRESENTS ITSELF IN NO SUCH LIGHT HE SEES A MASS OF MISERY WHICH HE BELIEVES AND IN LARGE MEASURE JUSTLY BELIEVES SOCIALISM WOULD PUT AN END TO AND HE HAS NO PATIENCE WITH THE CONSERVATIVE WHO POINTS OUT
2673-162129-0027 AND AWAY WITH IT WE OUGHT ALL TO SAY IF SOCIALISM WHILE DOING AWAY WITH IT WOULD NOT BE DOING AWAY WITH SOMETHING ELSE OF INFINITE VALUE AND INFINITE BENEFIT TO MANKIND BOTH MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL
2673-162129-0028 SOMETHING WITH WHICH IS BOUND UP THE RICHNESS AND ZEST OF LIFE NOT ONLY FOR WHAT IT IS THE FASHION OF RADICALS TO CALL THE PRIVILEGED FEW BUT FOR THE GREAT MASS OF MANKIND THAT SOMETHING IS LIBERTY
2673-162129-0029 AND THE INDIVIDUALITY WHICH IS INSEPARABLY BOUND UP WITH LIBERTY THE ESSENCE OF SOCIALISM IS THE SUPPRESSION OF INDIVIDUALITY THE EXALTATION OF THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND THE COLLECTIVE INTEREST
2673-162129-0030 THE SUBMERGENCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL WILL AND THE INDIVIDUAL INTEREST THE PARTICULAR FORM EVEN THE PARTICULAR DEGREE OF COERCION BY WHICH THIS SUBMERGENCE IS BROUGHT ABOUT
2673-162129-0031 VARIES WITH THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOCIALISM BUT THEY ALL AGREE IN THE ESSENTIAL FACT OF THE SUBMERGENCE SOCIALISM MAY POSSIBLY BE COMPATIBLE WITH PROSPERITY WITH CONTENTMENT IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH LIBERTY
2673-162129-0032 NOT COMPATIBLE WITH INDIVIDUALITY I AM OF COURSE NOT UNDERTAKING HERE TO DISCUSS THE MERITS OF SOCIALISM MY PURPOSE IS ONLY TO POINT OUT THAT THOSE WHO ARE HOSTILE TO SOCIALISM MUST CHERISH LIBERTY
2673-162129-0033 AND IT IS VAIN TO CHERISH LIBERTY IN THE ABSTRACT IF YOU ARE DOING YOUR BEST TO DRY UP THE VERY SOURCE OF THE LOVE OF LIBERTY IN THE CONCRETE WORKINGS OF EVERY MAN'S DAILY EXPERIENCE WITH THE PLAIN MAN INDEED WITH MEN IN GENERAL
2673-162129-0034 PLAIN OR OTHERWISE LOVE OF LIBERTY OR OF ANY ELEMENTAL CONCEPT IS STRONG ONLY IF IT IS INSTINCTIVE
2673-162129-0035 AND IT CANNOT BE INSTINCTIVE IF IT IS JARRED EVERY DAY BY HABITUAL AND UNRESENTED EXPERIENCE OF ITS OPPOSITE PROHIBITION IS A RESTRAINT OF LIBERTY SO CLEARLY UNRELATED TO ANY PRIMARY NEED OF THE STATE
2673-162129-0036 WHICH CAN CLAIM THE JUSTIFICATION OF BEING INTENDED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE POOR OR UNFORTUNATE SO LONG AS PROHIBITION WAS A LOCAL MEASURE SO LONG EVEN AS IT WAS A MEASURE OF STATE LEGISLATION
2673-162129-0037 THIS EFFECT DID NOT FOLLOW OR IF AT ALL ONLY IN A SMALL DEGREE PEOPLE DID NOT REGARD IT AS A DOMINANT AND ABOVE ALL AS A PARAMOUNT AND INESCAPABLE PART OF THE NATIONAL LIFE BUT DECREED FOR THE WHOLE NATION
2673-162129-0038 AND IMBEDDED PERMANENTLY IN THE CONSTITUTION IT WILL HAVE AN IMMEASURABLE EFFECT IN IMPAIRING THAT INSTINCT OF LIBERTY WHICH HAS BEEN THE VERY HEART OF THE AMERICAN SPIRIT
2673-162129-0039 AND WITH THE LOSS OF THAT SPIRIT WILL BE LOST THE ONE GREAT AND ENDURING DEFENSE AGAINST SOCIALISM IT IS NOT BY THE ARGUMENTATION OF ECONOMISTS NOR BY THE CALCULATIONS OF STATISTICIANS THAT THE SOCIALIST ADVANCE CAN BE HALTED
2673-162129-0040 THE REAL STRUGGLE WILL BE A STRUGGLE NOT OF THE MIND BUT OF THE SPIRIT IT WILL BE SOCIALISM AND REGIMENTATION AGAINST INDIVIDUALISM AND LIBERTY THE CAUSE OF PROHIBITION HAS OWED ITS RAPID SUCCESS IN NO SMALL MEASURE
2673-162129-0041 TO THE SUPPORT OF GREAT CAPITALISTS AND INDUSTRIALISTS BENT UPON THE ABSORBING OBJECT OF PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY BUT THEY HAVE PAID A PRICE THEY LITTLE REALIZE FOR IN THE ATTAINMENT OF THIS MINOR OBJECT
2673-162129-0042 THEY HAVE MADE A TREMENDOUS BREACH IN THE GREATEST DEFENSE OF THE EXISTING ORDER OF SOCIETY AGAINST THE ADVANCING ENEMY TO UNDERMINE THE FOUNDATIONS OF LIBERTY
