1878-122453-0000 IN WHICH THE EQUIPMENT OF ARAMIS AND PORTHOS IS TREATED OF SINCE THE FOUR FRIENDS HAD BEEN EACH IN SEARCH OF HIS EQUIPMENTS THERE HAD BEEN NO FIXED MEETING BETWEEN THEM THEY DINED APART FROM ONE ANOTHER
1878-122453-0001 WHEREVER THEY MIGHT HAPPEN TO BE OR RATHER WHERE THEY COULD DUTY LIKEWISE ON ITS PART TOOK A PORTION OF THAT PRECIOUS TIME WHICH WAS GLIDING AWAY SO RAPIDLY ONLY THEY HAD AGREED TO MEET ONCE A WEEK ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK
1878-122453-0002 AT THE RESIDENCE OF ATHOS SEEING THAT HE IN AGREEMENT WITH THE VOW HE HAD FORMED DID NOT PASS OVER THE THRESHOLD OF HIS DOOR THIS DAY OF REUNION WAS THE SAME DAY AS THAT ON WHICH KITTY CAME TO FIND D'ARTAGNAN
1878-122453-0003 D'ARTAGNAN DIRECTED HIS STEPS
1878-122453-0004 HE FOUND ATHOS AND ARAMIS PHILOSOPHIZING ARAMIS HAD SOME SLIGHT INCLINATION TO RESUME THE CASSOCK ATHOS ACCORDING TO HIS SYSTEM NEITHER ENCOURAGED NOR DISSUADED HIM
1878-122453-0005 ATHOS BELIEVED THAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE LEFT TO HIS OWN FREE WILL HE NEVER GAVE ADVICE BUT WHEN IT WAS ASKED AND EVEN THEN HE REQUIRED TO BE ASKED TWICE PEOPLE IN GENERAL HE SAID
1878-122453-0006 ONLY ASK ADVICE NOT TO FOLLOW IT OR IF THEY DO FOLLOW IT IT IS FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING SOMEONE TO BLAME FOR HAVING GIVEN IT PORTHOS ARRIVED A MINUTE AFTER D'ARTAGNAN
1878-122453-0007 THE FOUR COUNTENANCES EXPRESSED FOUR DIFFERENT FEELINGS THAT OF PORTHOS TRANQUILLITY THAT OF D'ARTAGNAN HOPE THAT OF ARAMIS UNEASINESS THAT OF ATHOS CARELESSNESS
1878-122453-0008 AT THE END OF A MOMENT'S CONVERSATION IN WHICH PORTHOS HINTED THAT A LADY OF ELEVATED RANK HAD CONDESCENDED TO RELIEVE HIM FROM HIS EMBARRASSMENT MOUSQUETON ENTERED HE CAME TO REQUEST HIS MASTER TO RETURN TO HIS LODGINGS
1878-122453-0009 WHERE HIS PRESENCE WAS URGENT AS HE PITEOUSLY SAID IS IT MY EQUIPMENT YES AND NO
1878-122453-0010 WELL BUT CAN'T YOU SPEAK COME MONSIEUR PORTHOS ROSE SALUTED HIS FRIENDS AND FOLLOWED MOUSQUETON AN INSTANT AFTER BAZIN MADE HIS APPEARANCE AT THE DOOR
1878-122453-0011 WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME MY FRIEND SAID ARAMIS
1878-122453-0012 THAT HIS IDEAS WERE DIRECTED TOWARD THE CHURCH A MAN WISHES TO SEE MONSIEUR AT HOME REPLIED BAZIN A MAN WHAT MAN A MENDICANT GIVE HIM ALMS BAZIN
1878-122453-0013 AND BID HIM PRAY FOR A POOR SINNER THIS MENDICANT INSISTS UPON SPEAKING TO YOU AND PRETENDS THAT YOU WILL BE VERY GLAD TO SEE HIM HAS HE SENT NO PARTICULAR MESSAGE FOR ME
1878-122453-0014 YES IF MONSIEUR ARAMIS HESITATES TO COME HE SAID TELL HIM I AM FROM TOURS FROM TOURS CRIED ARAMIS A THOUSAND PARDONS GENTLEMEN BUT NO DOUBT THIS MAN BRINGS ME THE NEWS I EXPECTED
1878-122453-0015 AND RISING ALSO HE WENT OFF AT A QUICK PACE THERE REMAINED ATHOS AND D'ARTAGNAN I BELIEVE THESE FELLOWS HAVE MANAGED THEIR BUSINESS WHAT DO YOU THINK D'ARTAGNAN SAID ATHOS
1878-122453-0016 I KNOW THAT PORTHOS WAS IN A FAIR WAY REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN AND AS TO ARAMIS TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I HAVE NEVER BEEN SERIOUSLY UNEASY ON HIS ACCOUNT BUT YOU MY DEAR ATHOS YOU WHO SO
1878-122453-0017 GENEROUSLY DISTRIBUTED THE ENGLISHMAN'S PISTOLES WHICH WERE OUR LEGITIMATE PROPERTY WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO I AM SATISFIED WITH HAVING KILLED THAT FELLOW MY BOY

1878-122453-0024 IT IS THE LONGEST ROAD BUT CERTAINLY THE MOST AMUSING D'ARTAGNAN WAS ON THE POINT OF TELLING ATHOS ALL BUT ONE CONSIDERATION RESTRAINED HIM ATHOS WAS A GENTLEMAN PUNCTILIOUS IN POINTS OF HONOR
1878-122453-0025 HE WAS THEREFORE SILENT AND AS ATHOS WAS THE LEAST INQUISITIVE OF ANY MAN ON EARTH D'ARTAGNAN'S CONFIDENCE STOPPED THERE WE WILL THEREFORE LEAVE THE TWO FRIENDS WHO HAD NOTHING IMPORTANT TO SAY TO EACH OTHER
1878-122453-0026 AND FOLLOW ARAMIS UPON BEING INFORMED THAT THE PERSON WHO WANTED TO SPEAK TO HIM CAME FROM TOURS WE HAVE SEEN WITH WHAT RAPIDITY THE YOUNG MAN FOLLOWED
