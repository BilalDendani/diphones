98-199-0000 IN ADDITION TO WHAT HAS BEEN ALREADY SAID OF CATHERINE MORLAND'S PERSONAL AND MENTAL ENDOWMENTS WHEN ABOUT TO BE LAUNCHED INTO ALL THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS OF A SIX WEEKS RESIDENCE IN BATH
98-199-0001 IT MAY BE STATED FOR THE READER'S MORE CERTAIN INFORMATION LEST THE FOLLOWING PAGES SHOULD OTHERWISE FAIL OF GIVING ANY IDEA OF WHAT HER CHARACTER IS MEANT TO BE THAT HER HEART WAS AFFECTIONATE HER DISPOSITION CHEERFUL AND OPEN
98-199-0002 WITHOUT CONCEIT OR AFFECTATION OF ANY KIND HER MANNERS JUST REMOVED FROM THE AWKWARDNESS AND SHYNESS OF A GIRL HER PERSON PLEASING AND WHEN IN GOOD LOOKS PRETTY
98-199-0003 WILL BE NATURALLY SUPPOSED TO BE MOST SEVERE A THOUSAND ALARMING PRESENTIMENTS OF EVIL TO HER BELOVED CATHERINE FROM THIS TERRIFIC SEPARATION MUST OPPRESS HER HEART WITH SADNESS
98-199-0004 AND DROWN HER IN TEARS FOR THE LAST DAY OR TWO OF THEIR BEING TOGETHER AND ADVICE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND APPLICABLE NATURE MUST OF COURSE FLOW FROM HER WISE LIPS IN THEIR PARTING CONFERENCE IN HER CLOSET
98-199-0005 CAUTIONS AGAINST THE VIOLENCE OF SUCH NOBLEMEN AND BARONETS AS DELIGHT IN FORCING YOUNG LADIES AWAY TO SOME REMOTE FARM HOUSE MUST AT SUCH A MOMENT RELIEVE THE FULNESS OF HER HEART WHO WOULD NOT THINK SO
98-199-0006 BUT MISSUS MORLAND KNEW SO LITTLE OF LORDS AND BARONETS THAT SHE ENTERTAINED NO NOTION OF THEIR GENERAL MISCHIEVOUSNESS AND WAS WHOLLY UNSUSPICIOUS OF DANGER TO HER DAUGHTER FROM THEIR MACHINATIONS
98-199-0007 HER CAUTIONS WERE CONFINED TO THE FOLLOWING POINTS I BEG CATHERINE
98-199-0008 WHEN YOU COME FROM THE ROOMS AT NIGHT AND I WISH YOU WOULD TRY TO KEEP SOME ACCOUNT OF THE MONEY YOU SPEND I WILL GIVE YOU THIS LITTLE BOOK ON PURPOSE SALLY OR RATHER SARAH
98-199-0009 MUST FROM SITUATION BE AT THIS TIME THE INTIMATE FRIEND AND CONFIDANTE OF HER SISTER IT IS REMARKABLE HOWEVER THAT SHE NEITHER INSISTED ON CATHERINE'S WRITING BY EVERY POST
98-199-0010 WITH A DEGREE OF MODERATION AND COMPOSURE WHICH SEEMED RATHER CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMON FEELINGS OF COMMON LIFE THAN WITH THE REFINED SUSCEPTIBILITIES THE TENDER EMOTIONS WHICH THE FIRST SEPARATION OF A HEROINE FROM HER FAMILY OUGHT ALWAYS TO EXCITE
98-199-0011 HER FATHER INSTEAD OF GIVING HER AN UNLIMITED ORDER ON HIS BANKER OR EVEN PUTTING AN HUNDRED POUNDS BANK BILL INTO HER HANDS GAVE HER ONLY TEN GUINEAS AND PROMISED HER MORE WHEN SHE WANTED IT
98-199-0012 UNDER THESE UNPROMISING AUSPICES THE PARTING TOOK PLACE AND THE JOURNEY BEGAN IT WAS PERFORMED WITH SUITABLE QUIETNESS AND UNEVENTFUL SAFETY NEITHER ROBBERS NOR TEMPESTS BEFRIENDED THEM
98-199-0013 NOR ONE LUCKY OVERTURN TO INTRODUCE THEM TO THE HERO NOTHING MORE ALARMING OCCURRED THAN A FEAR ON MISSUS ALLEN'S SIDE OF HAVING ONCE LEFT HER CLOGS BEHIND HER AT AN INN
98-199-0014 AND THAT FORTUNATELY PROVED TO BE GROUNDLESS THEY ARRIVED AT BATH CATHERINE WAS ALL EAGER DELIGHT HER EYES WERE HERE THERE EVERYWHERE AS THEY APPROACHED ITS FINE AND STRIKING ENVIRONS
98-199-0015 AND AFTERWARDS DROVE THROUGH THOSE STREETS WHICH CONDUCTED THEM TO THE HOTEL SHE WAS COME TO BE HAPPY AND SHE FELT HAPPY ALREADY THEY WERE SOON SETTLED IN COMFORTABLE LODGINGS IN PULTENEY STREET
98-199-0016 THAT THE READER MAY BE ABLE TO JUDGE IN WHAT MANNER HER ACTIONS WILL HEREAFTER TEND TO PROMOTE THE GENERAL DISTRESS OF THE WORK AND HOW SHE WILL PROBABLY CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCE POOR CATHERINE TO ALL THE DESPERATE WRETCHEDNESS
98-199-0017 OF WHICH A LAST VOLUME IS CAPABLE WHETHER BY HER IMPRUDENCE VULGARITY OR JEALOUSY WHETHER BY INTERCEPTING HER LETTERS RUINING HER CHARACTER OR TURNING HER OUT OF DOORS
98-199-0018 MISSUS ALLEN WAS ONE OF THAT NUMEROUS CLASS OF FEMALES WHOSE SOCIETY CAN RAISE NO OTHER EMOTION THAN SURPRISE AT THERE BEING ANY MEN IN THE WORLD WHO COULD LIKE THEM WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY THEM
98-199-0019 WERE ALL THAT COULD ACCOUNT FOR HER BEING THE CHOICE OF A SENSIBLE INTELLIGENT MAN LIKE MISTER ALLEN IN ONE RESPECT SHE WAS ADMIRABLY FITTED TO INTRODUCE A YOUNG LADY INTO PUBLIC
98-199-0020 BEING AS FOND OF GOING EVERYWHERE AND SEEING EVERYTHING HERSELF AS ANY YOUNG LADY COULD BE DRESS WAS HER PASSION SHE HAD A MOST HARMLESS DELIGHT IN BEING FINE AND OUR HEROINE'S ENTREE INTO LIFE
98-199-0021 COULD NOT TAKE PLACE TILL AFTER THREE OR FOUR DAYS HAD BEEN SPENT IN LEARNING WHAT WAS MOSTLY WORN AND HER CHAPERONE WAS PROVIDED WITH A DRESS OF THE NEWEST FASHION CATHERINE TOO MADE SOME PURCHASES HERSELF
98-199-0022 AND WHEN ALL THESE MATTERS WERE ARRANGED THE IMPORTANT EVENING CAME WHICH WAS TO USHER HER INTO THE UPPER ROOMS HER HAIR WAS CUT AND DRESSED BY THE BEST HAND HER CLOTHES PUT ON WITH CARE
98-199-0023 AND BOTH MISSUS ALLEN AND HER MAID DECLARED SHE LOOKED QUITE AS SHE SHOULD DO WITH SUCH ENCOURAGEMENT CATHERINE HOPED AT LEAST TO PASS UNCENSURED THROUGH THE CROWD AS FOR ADMIRATION
98-199-0024 IT WAS ALWAYS VERY WELCOME WHEN IT CAME BUT SHE DID NOT DEPEND ON IT MISSUS ALLEN WAS SO LONG IN DRESSING THAT THEY DID NOT ENTER THE BALLROOM TILL LATE THE SEASON WAS FULL THE ROOM CROWDED
98-199-0025 MISSUS ALLEN MADE HER WAY THROUGH THE THRONG OF MEN BY THE DOOR AS SWIFTLY AS THE NECESSARY CAUTION WOULD ALLOW CATHERINE HOWEVER KEPT CLOSE AT HER SIDE AND LINKED HER ARM TOO FIRMLY WITHIN HER FRIEND'S TO BE TORN ASUNDER BY ANY COMMON EFFORT OF A STRUGGLING ASSEMBLY
98-199-0026 BUT TO HER UTTER AMAZEMENT SHE FOUND THAT TO PROCEED ALONG THE ROOM WAS BY NO MEANS THE WAY TO DISENGAGE THEMSELVES FROM THE CROWD IT SEEMED RATHER TO INCREASE AS THEY WENT ON
98-199-0027 THEY SAW NOTHING OF THE DANCERS BUT THE HIGH FEATHERS OF SOME OF THE LADIES STILL THEY MOVED ON SOMETHING BETTER WAS YET IN VIEW AND BY A CONTINUED EXERTION OF STRENGTH AND INGENUITY
98-199-0028 THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT LAST IN THE PASSAGE BEHIND THE HIGHEST BENCH
98-199-0029 AND HENCE MISS MORLAND HAD A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF ALL THE COMPANY BENEATH HER AND OF ALL THE DANGERS OF HER LATE PASSAGE THROUGH THEM IT WAS A SPLENDID SIGHT AND SHE BEGAN FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT EVENING
98-199-0030 TO FEEL HERSELF AT A BALL SHE LONGED TO DANCE BUT SHE HAD NOT AN ACQUAINTANCE IN THE ROOM MISSUS ALLEN DID ALL THAT SHE COULD DO IN SUCH A CASE BY SAYING VERY PLACIDLY EVERY NOW AND THEN
98-199-0031 I WISH YOU COULD DANCE MY DEAR I WISH YOU COULD GET A PARTNER FOR SOME TIME HER YOUNG FRIEND FELT OBLIGED TO HER FOR THESE WISHES BUT THEY WERE REPEATED SO OFTEN
98-199-0032 AND PROVED SO TOTALLY INEFFECTUAL THAT CATHERINE GREW TIRED AT LAST AND WOULD THANK HER NO MORE THEY WERE NOT LONG ABLE HOWEVER TO ENJOY THE REPOSE OF THE EMINENCE THEY HAD SO LABORIOUSLY GAINED
98-199-0033 THAT SHE COULD NOT RELIEVE THE IRKSOMENESS OF IMPRISONMENT BY THE EXCHANGE OF A SYLLABLE WITH ANY OF HER FELLOW CAPTIVES AND WHEN AT LAST ARRIVED IN THE TEA ROOM SHE FELT YET MORE THE AWKWARDNESS OF HAVING NO PARTY TO JOIN
98-199-0034 NO ACQUAINTANCE TO CLAIM NO GENTLEMAN TO ASSIST THEM THEY SAW NOTHING OF MISTER ALLEN AND AFTER LOOKING ABOUT THEM IN VAIN FOR A MORE ELIGIBLE SITUATION WERE OBLIGED TO SIT DOWN AT THE END OF A TABLE
98-199-0035 AT WHICH A LARGE PARTY WERE ALREADY PLACED WITHOUT HAVING ANYTHING TO DO THERE OR ANYBODY TO SPEAK TO EXCEPT EACH OTHER MISSUS ALLEN CONGRATULATED HERSELF AS SOON AS THEY WERE SEATED
98-199-0036 ON HAVING PRESERVED HER GOWN FROM INJURY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY SHOCKING TO HAVE IT TORN
98-199-0037 FOR MY PART I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING I LIKE SO WELL IN THE WHOLE ROOM I ASSURE YOU HOW UNCOMFORTABLE IT IS WHISPERED CATHERINE NOT TO HAVE A SINGLE ACQUAINTANCE HERE
98-199-0038 YES MY DEAR REPLIED MISSUS ALLEN WITH PERFECT SERENITY IT IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE INDEED
98-199-0039 I WISH WE HAD ANY IT WOULD BE SOMEBODY TO GO TO VERY TRUE MY DEAR AND IF WE KNEW ANYBODY WE WOULD JOIN THEM DIRECTLY THE SKINNERS WERE HERE LAST YEAR I WISH THEY WERE HERE NOW
98-199-0040 HERE ARE NO TEA THINGS FOR US YOU SEE NO MORE THERE ARE INDEED HOW VERY PROVOKING
98-199-0041 SOMEBODY GAVE ME A PUSH THAT HAS HURT IT I AM AFRAID NO INDEED IT LOOKS VERY NICE BUT
98-199-0042 I DON'T UPON MY WORD I WISH I DID I WISH I HAD A LARGE ACQUAINTANCE HERE WITH ALL MY HEART AND THEN I SHOULD GET YOU A PARTNER
98-199-0043 HOW OLD FASHIONED IT IS LOOK AT THE BACK AFTER SOME TIME THEY RECEIVED AN OFFER OF TEA FROM ONE OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS IT WAS THANKFULLY ACCEPTED AND THIS INTRODUCED A LIGHT CONVERSATION WITH THE GENTLEMAN WHO OFFERED IT
98-199-0044 WHICH WAS THE ONLY TIME THAT ANYBODY SPOKE TO THEM DURING THE EVENING TILL THEY WERE DISCOVERED AND JOINED BY MISTER ALLEN WHEN THE DANCE WAS OVER WELL MISS MORLAND SAID HE DIRECTLY I HOPE YOU HAVE HAD AN AGREEABLE BALL
98-199-0045 VERY AGREEABLE INDEED SHE REPLIED VAINLY ENDEAVOURING TO HIDE A GREAT YAWN I WISH SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DANCE SAID HIS WIFE I WISH WE COULD HAVE GOT A PARTNER FOR HER
98-199-0046 I HAVE BEEN SAYING HOW GLAD I SHOULD BE IF THE SKINNERS WERE HERE THIS WINTER INSTEAD OF LAST OR IF THE PARRYS HAD COME AS THEY TALKED OF ONCE SHE MIGHT HAVE DANCED WITH GEORGE PARRY I AM SO SORRY SHE HAS NOT HAD A PARTNER
98-199-0047 WE SHALL DO BETTER ANOTHER EVENING I HOPE WAS MISTER ALLEN'S CONSOLATION THE COMPANY BEGAN TO DISPERSE WHEN THE DANCING WAS OVER ENOUGH TO LEAVE SPACE FOR THE REMAINDER TO WALK ABOUT IN SOME COMFORT
98-199-0048 AND NOW WAS THE TIME FOR A HEROINE WHO HAD NOT YET PLAYED A VERY DISTINGUISHED PART IN THE EVENTS OF THE EVENING TO BE NOTICED AND ADMIRED EVERY FIVE MINUTES BY REMOVING SOME OF THE CROWD GAVE GREATER OPENINGS FOR HER CHARMS
98-199-0049 SHE WAS NOW SEEN BY MANY YOUNG MEN WHO HAD NOT BEEN NEAR HER BEFORE NOT ONE HOWEVER STARTED WITH RAPTUROUS WONDER ON BEHOLDING HER NO WHISPER OF EAGER INQUIRY RAN ROUND THE ROOM
98-199-0050 NOR WAS SHE ONCE CALLED A DIVINITY BY ANYBODY YET CATHERINE WAS IN VERY GOOD LOOKS AND HAD THE COMPANY ONLY SEEN HER THREE YEARS BEFORE THEY WOULD NOW HAVE THOUGHT HER EXCEEDINGLY HANDSOME
98-199-0051 SHE WAS LOOKED AT HOWEVER AND WITH SOME ADMIRATION FOR IN HER OWN HEARING TWO GENTLEMEN PRONOUNCED HER TO BE A PRETTY GIRL SUCH WORDS HAD THEIR DUE EFFECT
98-199-0052 SHE IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT THE EVENING PLEASANTER THAN SHE HAD FOUND IT BEFORE HER HUMBLE VANITY WAS CONTENTED SHE FELT MORE OBLIGED TO THE TWO YOUNG MEN FOR THIS SIMPLE PRAISE THAN A TRUE QUALITY HEROINE
98-199-0053 WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR FIFTEEN SONNETS IN CELEBRATION OF HER CHARMS AND WENT TO HER CHAIR IN GOOD HUMOUR WITH EVERYBODY
