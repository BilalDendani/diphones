4773-19207-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN ONE SOMETIMES RUNS AGROUND WHEN ONE FANCIES THAT ONE IS DISEMBARKING HE SET OUT ON HIS WAY ONCE MORE HOWEVER ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT LEFT HIS LIFE IN THE FONTIS
4773-19207-0001 HE SEEMED TO HAVE LEFT HIS STRENGTH BEHIND HIM THERE THAT SUPREME EFFORT HAD EXHAUSTED HIM HIS LASSITUDE WAS NOW SUCH THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO PAUSE FOR BREATH EVERY THREE OR FOUR STEPS AND LEAN AGAINST THE WALL
4773-19207-0002 ONCE HE WAS FORCED TO SEAT HIMSELF ON THE BANQUETTE IN ORDER TO ALTER MARIUS POSITION AND HE THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE TO REMAIN THERE BUT IF HIS VIGOR WAS DEAD HIS ENERGY WAS NOT HE ROSE AGAIN
4773-19207-0003 HE WALKED ON DESPERATELY ALMOST FAST PROCEEDED THUS FOR A HUNDRED PACES ALMOST WITHOUT DRAWING BREATH AND SUDDENLY CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE WALL HE HAD REACHED AN ELBOW OF THE SEWER AND
4773-19207-0004 IT WAS A POINTED ARCH LOWER THAN THE VAULT WHICH GRADUALLY NARROWED AND NARROWER THAN THE GALLERY WHICH CLOSED IN AS THE VAULT GREW LOWER THE TUNNEL ENDED LIKE THE INTERIOR OF A FUNNEL A FAULTY CONSTRUCTION
4773-19207-0005 IMITATED FROM THE WICKETS OF PENITENTIARIES LOGICAL IN A PRISON ILLOGICAL IN A SEWER AND WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN CORRECTED JEAN VALJEAN REACHED THE OUTLET THERE HE HALTED IT CERTAINLY WAS THE OUTLET
4773-19207-0006 BUT HE COULD NOT GET OUT THE ARCH WAS CLOSED BY A HEAVY GRATING AND THE GRATING WHICH TO ALL APPEARANCE RARELY SWUNG ON ITS RUSTY HINGES WAS CLAMPED TO ITS STONE JAMB BY A THICK LOCK
4773-19207-0007 PARIS THAT GULF IN WHICH ONE SO EASILY HIDES ONESELF THE BROAD HORIZON LIBERTY ON THE RIGHT DOWN STREAM THE BRIDGE OF JENA WAS DISCERNIBLE ON THE LEFT UPSTREAM THE BRIDGE OF THE INVALIDES
4773-19207-0008 THE PLACE WOULD HAVE BEEN A PROPITIOUS ONE IN WHICH TO AWAIT THE NIGHT AND TO ESCAPE IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST SOLITARY POINTS IN PARIS
4773-19207-0009 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HALF PAST EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING THE DAY WAS DECLINING JEAN VALJEAN LAID MARIUS DOWN ALONG THE WALL ON THE DRY PORTION OF THE VAULTING THEN HE WENT TO THE GRATING AND CLENCHED BOTH FISTS ROUND THE BARS
4773-19207-0010 THE SHOCK WHICH HE GAVE IT WAS FRENZIED BUT IT DID NOT MOVE THE GRATING DID NOT STIR JEAN VALJEAN SEIZED THE BARS ONE AFTER THE OTHER IN THE HOPE THAT HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TEAR AWAY THE LEAST SOLID AND TO MAKE OF IT A LEVER
4773-19207-0011 WHENCE HE HAD ONLY EXTRICATED HIMSELF AS BY A MIRACLE AND AFTER THE QUAGMIRE WAS THERE NOT THE POLICE PATROL WHICH ASSUREDLY COULD NOT BE TWICE AVOIDED AND THEN WHITHER WAS HE TO GO WHAT DIRECTION SHOULD HE PURSUE
4773-19207-0012 TO FOLLOW THE INCLINE WOULD NOT CONDUCT HIM TO HIS GOAL IF HE WERE TO REACH ANOTHER OUTLET HE WOULD FIND IT OBSTRUCTED BY A PLUG OR A GRATING EVERY OUTLET WAS UNDOUBTEDLY CLOSED IN THAT MANNER
4773-19207-0013 CHANCE HAD UNSEALED THE GRATING THROUGH WHICH HE HAD ENTERED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT ALL THE OTHER SEWER MOUTHS WERE BARRED HE HAD ONLY SUCCEEDED IN ESCAPING INTO A PRISON ALL WAS OVER EVERYTHING THAT JEAN VALJEAN HAD DONE
4773-19207-0014 WAS USELESS EXHAUSTION HAD ENDED IN FAILURE THEY WERE BOTH CAUGHT IN THE IMMENSE AND GLOOMY WEB OF DEATH AND JEAN VALJEAN FELT THE TERRIBLE SPIDER RUNNING ALONG THOSE BLACK STRANDS AND QUIVERING IN THE SHADOWS
4773-19207-0015 HE TURNED HIS BACK TO THE GRATING AND FELL UPON THE PAVEMENT HURLED TO EARTH RATHER THAN SEATED CLOSE TO MARIUS WHO STILL MADE NO MOVEMENT AND WITH HIS HEAD BENT BETWEEN HIS KNEES THIS WAS THE LAST DROP OF ANGUISH
4773-19207-0016 A HAND WAS LAID ON HIS SHOULDER AND A LOW VOICE SAID TO HIM HALF SHARES SOME PERSON IN THAT GLOOM NOTHING SO CLOSELY RESEMBLES A DREAM AS DESPAIR JEAN VALJEAN THOUGHT THAT HE WAS DREAMING
4773-19207-0017 HE HAD HEARD NO FOOTSTEPS WAS IT POSSIBLE HE RAISED HIS EYES A MAN STOOD BEFORE HIM THIS MAN WAS CLAD IN A BLOUSE HIS FEET WERE BARE HE HELD HIS SHOES IN HIS LEFT HAND HE HAD EVIDENTLY REMOVED THEM
4773-19207-0018 IN ORDER TO REACH JEAN VALJEAN WITHOUT ALLOWING HIS STEPS TO BE HEARD JEAN VALJEAN DID NOT HESITATE FOR AN INSTANT UNEXPECTED AS WAS THIS ENCOUNTER THIS MAN WAS KNOWN TO HIM THE MAN WAS THENARDIER
4773-19207-0019 ALTHOUGH AWAKENED SO TO SPEAK WITH A START JEAN VALJEAN ACCUSTOMED TO ALARMS AND STEELED TO UNFORESEEN SHOCKS THAT MUST BE PROMPTLY PARRIED INSTANTLY REGAINED POSSESSION OF HIS PRESENCE OF MIND MOREOVER
4773-19207-0020 THE SITUATION COULD NOT BE MADE WORSE A CERTAIN DEGREE OF DISTRESS IS NO LONGER CAPABLE OF A CRESCENDO AND THENARDIER HIMSELF COULD ADD NOTHING TO THIS BLACKNESS OF THIS NIGHT A MOMENTARY PAUSE ENSUED
4773-19207-0021 FORMED WITH IT A SHADE THEN HE BROUGHT HIS EYELASHES TOGETHER BY SCREWING UP HIS EYES A MOTION WHICH IN CONNECTION WITH A SLIGHT CONTRACTION OF THE MOUTH CHARACTERIZES THE SAGACIOUS ATTENTION OF A MAN
4773-19207-0022 WHO IS ENDEAVORING TO RECOGNIZE ANOTHER MAN HE DID NOT SUCCEED
4773-19207-0023 AS WE HAVE JUST STATED HAD HIS BACK TURNED TO THE LIGHT AND HE WAS MOREOVER SO DISFIGURED SO BEMIRED SO BLEEDING THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN UNRECOGNIZABLE IN FULL NOONDAY ON THE CONTRARY
4773-19207-0024 THIS INEQUALITY OF CONDITIONS SUFFICED TO ASSURE SOME ADVANTAGE TO JEAN VALJEAN IN THAT MYSTERIOUS DUEL WHICH WAS ON THE POINT OF BEGINNING BETWEEN THE TWO SITUATIONS
4773-19207-0025 JEAN VALJEAN IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVED THAT THENARDIER DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIM THEY SURVEYED EACH OTHER FOR A MOMENT IN THAT HALF GLOOM AS THOUGH TAKING EACH OTHER'S MEASURE THENARDIER WAS THE FIRST TO BREAK THE SILENCE
4773-19207-0026 HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE TO GET OUT JEAN VALJEAN MADE NO REPLY THENARDIER CONTINUED IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PICK THE LOCK OF THAT GATE BUT STILL YOU MUST GET OUT OF THIS THAT IS TRUE SAID JEAN VALJEAN
4773-19207-0027 WELL HALF SHARES THEN WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT YOU HAVE KILLED THAT MAN THAT'S ALL RIGHT I HAVE THE KEY THENARDIER POINTED TO MARIUS HE WENT ON I DON'T KNOW YOU BUT I WANT TO HELP YOU YOU MUST BE A FRIEND
4773-19207-0028 I'LL OPEN THE DOOR FOR YOU AND HALF DRAWING FROM BENEATH HIS TATTERED BLOUSE A HUGE KEY HE ADDED DO YOU WANT TO SEE HOW A KEY TO LIBERTY IS MADE LOOK HERE
4773-19207-0029 THENARDIER THRUST HIS FIST INTO A LARGE POCKET CONCEALED UNDER HIS BLOUSE DREW OUT A ROPE AND OFFERED IT TO JEAN VALJEAN HOLD ON SAID HE
4773-19207-0030 WHAT IS THE ROPE FOR YOU WILL NEED A STONE ALSO BUT YOU CAN FIND ONE OUTSIDE THERE'S A HEAP OF RUBBISH WHAT AM I TO DO WITH A STONE IDIOT
4773-19207-0031 OTHERWISE IT WOULD FLOAT ON THE WATER JEAN VALJEAN TOOK THE ROPE THERE IS NO ONE WHO DOES NOT OCCASIONALLY ACCEPT IN THIS MECHANICAL WAY
4773-19207-0032 AS THOUGH AN IDEA HAD SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM AH SEE HERE COMRADE
4773-19207-0033 I HAVEN'T DARED TO RISK MYSELF IN IT PHEW YOU DON'T SMELL GOOD AFTER A PAUSE HE ADDED I'M ASKING YOU QUESTIONS BUT YOU'RE PERFECTLY RIGHT NOT TO ANSWER IT'S AN APPRENTICESHIP AGAINST THAT CURSED QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE THE EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
4773-19207-0034 AND THEN WHEN YOU DON'T TALK AT ALL YOU RUN NO RISK OF TALKING TOO LOUD THAT'S NO MATTER AS I CAN'T SEE YOUR FACE AND AS I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME YOU ARE WRONG IN SUPPOSING THAT I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU WANT I TWIG
4773-19207-0035 YOU'VE BROKEN UP THAT GENTLEMAN A BIT NOW YOU WANT TO TUCK HIM AWAY SOMEWHERE THE RIVER THAT GREAT HIDER OF FOLLY IS WHAT YOU WANT I'LL GET YOU OUT OF YOUR SCRAPE HELPING A GOOD FELLOW IN A PINCH IS WHAT SUITS ME TO A HAIR
4773-19207-0036 APROPOS OF THAT QUAGMIRE YOU'RE A HEARTY ANIMAL WHY DIDN'T YOU TOSS THE MAN IN THERE JEAN VALJEAN PRESERVED SILENCE THENARDIER RESUMED PUSHING THE RAG WHICH SERVED HIM AS A CRAVAT
4773-19207-0037 A GESTURE WHICH COMPLETES THE CAPABLE AIR OF A SERIOUS MAN AFTER ALL YOU ACTED WISELY THE WORKMEN WHEN THEY COME TO MORROW TO STOP UP THAT HOLE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE FOUND THE STIFF ABANDONED THERE AND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE
4773-19207-0038 WELL WHAT DOES ONE CARE FOR THAT IT'S CARRION WHO KILLED THAT MAN PARIS AND JUSTICE MAKES NO INQUIRIES YOU HAVE DONE WELL THE MORE LOQUACIOUS THENARDIER BECAME THE MORE MUTE WAS JEAN VALJEAN
4773-19207-0039 AGAIN THENARDIER SHOOK HIM BY THE SHOULDER NOW LET'S SETTLE THIS BUSINESS LET'S GO SHARES YOU HAVE SEEN MY KEY SHOW ME YOUR MONEY THENARDIER WAS HAGGARD FIERCE SUSPICIOUS RATHER MENACING
4773-19207-0040 THENARDIER'S MANNERS WERE NOT SIMPLE HE HAD NOT THE AIR OF BEING WHOLLY AT HIS EASE WHILE AFFECTING AN AIR OF MYSTERY HE SPOKE LOW FROM TIME TO TIME HE LAID HIS FINGER ON HIS MOUTH AND MUTTERED HUSH IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DIVINE WHY
4773-19207-0041 THERE WAS NO ONE THERE EXCEPT THEMSELVES
4773-19207-0042 NOT VERY FAR OFF AND THAT THENARDIER DID NOT CARE TO SHARE WITH THEM THENARDIER RESUMED
4773-19207-0043 HOW MUCH DID THE STIFF HAVE IN HIS BAGS JEAN VALJEAN SEARCHED HIS POCKETS IT WAS HIS HABIT AS THE READER WILL REMEMBER TO ALWAYS HAVE SOME MONEY ABOUT HIM THE MOURNFUL LIFE OF EXPEDIENTS TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN CONDEMNED
4773-19207-0044 TO TAKE HIS POCKET BOOK HE HAD ONLY SOME SMALL CHANGE IN HIS FOB HE TURNED OUT HIS POCKET ALL SOAKED WITH OOZE AND SPREAD OUT ON THE BANQUETTE OF THE VAULT ONE LOUIS D'OR TWO FIVE FRANC PIECES AND FIVE OR SIX LARGE SOUS
4773-19207-0045 THENARDIER THRUST OUT HIS LOWER LIP WITH A SIGNIFICANT TWIST OF THE NECK YOU KNOCKED HIM OVER CHEAP SAID HE HE SET TO FEELING THE POCKETS OF JEAN VALJEAN AND MARIUS WITH THE GREATEST FAMILIARITY JEAN VALJEAN
4773-19207-0046 HE FOUND NO MORE THAN THE THIRTY FRANCS THAT'S TRUE SAID HE BOTH OF YOU TOGETHER HAVE NO MORE THAN THAT AND FORGETTING HIS MOTTO HALF SHARES HE TOOK ALL HE HESITATED A LITTLE OVER THE LARGE SOUS
4773-19207-0047 AFTER DUE REFLECTION HE TOOK THEM ALSO MUTTERING NEVER MIND YOU CUT FOLKS THROATS TOO CHEAP ALTOGETHER THAT DONE HE ONCE MORE DREW THE BIG KEY FROM UNDER HIS BLOUSE NOW MY FRIEND YOU MUST LEAVE
4773-19207-0048 THE PURE AND DISINTERESTED INTENTION OF RESCUING AN ASSASSIN WE MAY BE PERMITTED TO DOUBT THIS THENARDIER HELPED JEAN VALJEAN TO REPLACE MARIUS ON HIS SHOULDERS
4773-19207-0049 THEN HE BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE GRATING ON TIPTOE AND BAREFOOTED MAKING JEAN VALJEAN A SIGN TO FOLLOW HIM LOOKED OUT LAID HIS FINGER ON HIS MOUTH AND REMAINED FOR SEVERAL SECONDS AS THOUGH IN SUSPENSE
4773-19207-0050 HIS INSPECTION FINISHED HE PLACED THE KEY IN THE LOCK THE BOLT SLIPPED BACK AND THE GATE SWUNG OPEN IT NEITHER GRATED NOR SQUEAKED IT MOVED VERY SOFTLY IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THIS GATE AND THOSE HINGES
4773-19207-0051 CAREFULLY OILED WERE IN THE HABIT OF OPENING MORE FREQUENTLY THAN WAS SUPPOSED THIS SOFTNESS WAS SUSPICIOUS
4773-19207-0052 OPENED THE GATE A LITTLE WAY ALLOWING JUST SUFFICIENT SPACE FOR JEAN VALJEAN TO PASS OUT CLOSED THE GRATING AGAIN GAVE THE KEY A DOUBLE TURN IN THE LOCK AND PLUNGED BACK INTO THE DARKNESS WITHOUT MAKING ANY MORE NOISE THAN A BREATH
4773-19207-0053 HE SEEMED TO WALK WITH THE VELVET PAWS OF A TIGER A MOMENT LATER THAT HIDEOUS PROVIDENCE HAD RETREATED INTO THE INVISIBILITY
