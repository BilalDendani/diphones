1425-139291-0000 ONE DAUGHTER LUCRETIA AND HER HUSBAND CAPTAIN THOMAS AULD THEY LIVED IN ONE HOUSE UPON THE HOME PLANTATION OF COLONEL EDWARD LLOYD MY MASTER WAS COLONEL LLOYD'S CLERK AND SUPERINTENDENT
1425-139291-0001 I SPENT TWO YEARS OF CHILDHOOD ON THIS PLANTATION IN MY OLD MASTER'S FAMILY IT WAS HERE THAT I WITNESSED THE BLOODY TRANSACTION RECORDED IN THE FIRST CHAPTER AND AS I RECEIVED MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF SLAVERY ON THIS PLANTATION I WILL GIVE SOME DESCRIPTION OF IT
1425-139291-0002 AND OF SLAVERY AS IT THERE EXISTED THE PLANTATION IS ABOUT TWELVE MILES NORTH OF EASTON IN TALBOT COUNTY AND IS SITUATED ON THE BORDER OF MILES RIVER THE PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS RAISED UPON IT WERE TOBACCO CORN AND WHEAT
1425-139291-0003 HE WAS ABLE TO KEEP IN ALMOST CONSTANT EMPLOYMENT A LARGE SLOOP IN CARRYING THEM TO MARKET AT BALTIMORE THIS SLOOP WAS NAMED SALLY LLOYD IN HONOR OF ONE OF THE COLONEL'S DAUGHTERS MY MASTER'S SON IN LAW CAPTAIN AULD WAS MASTER OF THE VESSEL
1425-139291-0004 SHE WAS OTHERWISE MANNED BY THE COLONEL'S OWN SLAVES THEIR NAMES WERE PETER ISAAC RICH AND JAKE THESE WERE ESTEEMED VERY HIGHLY BY THE OTHER SLAVES AND LOOKED UPON AS THE PRIVILEGED ONES OF THE PLANTATION
1425-139291-0005 WYE TOWN WAS UNDER THE OVERSEERSHIP OF A MAN NAMED NOAH WILLIS NEW DESIGN WAS UNDER THE OVERSEERSHIP OF A MISTER TOWNSEND THE OVERSEERS OF THESE AND ALL THE REST OF THE FARMS NUMBERING OVER TWENTY
1425-139291-0006 RECEIVED ADVICE AND DIRECTION FROM THE MANAGERS OF THE HOME PLANTATION THIS WAS THE GREAT BUSINESS PLACE IT WAS THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT FOR THE WHOLE TWENTY FARMS ALL DISPUTES AMONG THE OVERSEERS WERE SETTLED HERE IF A SLAVE WAS CONVICTED OF ANY HIGH MISDEMEANOR BECAME UNMANAGEABLE
1425-139291-0007 HE WAS BROUGHT IMMEDIATELY HERE SEVERELY WHIPPED PUT ON BOARD THE SLOOP CARRIED TO BALTIMORE AND SOLD TO AUSTIN WOOLFOLK OR SOME OTHER SLAVE TRADER AS A WARNING TO THE SLAVES REMAINING
1425-139291-0008 HERE TOO THE SLAVES OF ALL THE OTHER FARMS RECEIVED THEIR MONTHLY ALLOWANCE OF FOOD AND THEIR YEARLY CLOTHING THE MEN AND WOMEN SLAVES RECEIVED AS THEIR MONTHLY ALLOWANCE OF FOOD EIGHT POUNDS OF PORK OR ITS EQUIVALENT IN FISH AND ONE BUSHEL OF CORN MEAL
1425-139291-0009 THEIR YEARLY CLOTHING CONSISTED OF TWO COARSE LINEN SHIRTS ONE PAIR OF LINEN TROUSERS LIKE THE SHIRTS ONE JACKET ONE PAIR OF TROUSERS FOR WINTER MADE OF COARSE NEGRO CLOTH ONE PAIR OF STOCKINGS AND ONE PAIR OF SHOES
1425-139291-0010 THERE WERE NO BEDS GIVEN THE SLAVES UNLESS ONE COARSE BLANKET BE CONSIDERED SUCH AND NONE BUT THE MEN AND WOMEN HAD THESE THIS HOWEVER IS NOT CONSIDERED A VERY GREAT PRIVATION
1425-139291-0011 FOR WHEN THEIR DAY'S WORK IN THE FIELD IS DONE THE MOST OF THEM HAVING THEIR WASHING MENDING AND COOKING TO DO AND HAVING FEW OR NONE OF THE ORDINARY FACILITIES FOR DOING EITHER OF THESE VERY MANY OF THEIR SLEEPING HOURS ARE CONSUMED IN PREPARING FOR THE FIELD THE COMING DAY
1425-139291-0012 NO AGE NOR SEX FINDS ANY FAVOR MISTER SEVERE THE OVERSEER USED TO STAND BY THE DOOR OF THE QUARTER ARMED WITH A LARGE HICKORY STICK AND HEAVY COWSKIN READY TO WHIP ANY ONE WHO WAS SO UNFORTUNATE AS NOT TO HEAR
1425-139291-0013 AND THIS TOO IN THE MIDST OF HER CRYING CHILDREN PLEADING FOR THEIR MOTHER'S RELEASE HE SEEMED TO TAKE PLEASURE IN MANIFESTING HIS FIENDISH BARBARITY ADDED TO HIS CRUELTY HE WAS A PROFANE SWEARER
1425-139291-0014 IT WAS ENOUGH TO CHILL THE BLOOD AND STIFFEN THE HAIR OF AN ORDINARY MAN TO HEAR HIM TALK SCARCE A SENTENCE ESCAPED HIM BUT THAT WAS COMMENCED OR CONCLUDED BY SOME HORRID OATH THE FIELD WAS THE PLACE TO WITNESS HIS CRUELTY AND PROFANITY
1425-139291-0015 HE DIED VERY SOON AFTER I WENT TO COLONEL LLOYD'S AND HE DIED AS HE LIVED UTTERING WITH HIS DYING GROANS BITTER CURSES AND HORRID OATHS HIS DEATH WAS REGARDED BY THE SLAVES AS THE RESULT OF A MERCIFUL PROVIDENCE
1425-139291-0016 MISTER SEVERE'S PLACE WAS FILLED BY A MISTER HOPKINS HE WAS A VERY DIFFERENT MAN HE WAS LESS CRUEL LESS PROFANE AND MADE LESS NOISE THAN MISTER SEVERE HIS COURSE WAS CHARACTERIZED BY NO EXTRAORDINARY DEMONSTRATIONS OF CRUELTY
1425-139291-0017 HE WHIPPED BUT SEEMED TO TAKE NO PLEASURE IN IT HE WAS CALLED BY THE SLAVES A GOOD OVERSEER THE HOME PLANTATION OF COLONEL LLOYD WORE THE APPEARANCE OF A COUNTRY VILLAGE
1425-139291-0018 WERE PERFORMED HERE THE SHOEMAKING AND MENDING THE BLACKSMITHING CARTWRIGHTING COOPERING WEAVING AND GRAIN GRINDING WERE ALL PERFORMED BY THE SLAVES ON THE HOME PLANTATION THE WHOLE PLACE WORE A BUSINESS LIKE ASPECT VERY UNLIKE THE NEIGHBORING FARMS
1425-139291-0019 IT WAS ASSOCIATED IN THEIR MINDS WITH GREATNESS A REPRESENTATIVE COULD NOT BE PROUDER OF HIS ELECTION TO A SEAT IN THE AMERICAN CONGRESS THAN A SLAVE ON ONE OF THE OUT FARMS WOULD BE OF HIS ELECTION TO DO ERRANDS AT THE GREAT HOUSE FARM
1425-139291-0020 THEY REGARDED IT AS EVIDENCE OF GREAT CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN THEM BY THEIR OVERSEERS AND IT WAS ON THIS ACCOUNT AS WELL AS A CONSTANT DESIRE TO BE OUT OF THE FIELD FROM UNDER THE DRIVER'S LASH THAT THEY ESTEEMED IT A HIGH PRIVILEGE ONE WORTH CAREFUL LIVING FOR
1425-139291-0021 HE WAS CALLED THE SMARTEST AND MOST TRUSTY FELLOW WHO HAD THIS HONOR CONFERRED UPON HIM THE MOST FREQUENTLY
1425-139291-0022 THE COMPETITORS FOR THIS OFFICE SOUGHT AS DILIGENTLY TO PLEASE THEIR OVERSEERS AS THE OFFICE SEEKERS IN THE POLITICAL PARTIES SEEK TO PLEASE AND DECEIVE THE PEOPLE THE SAME TRAITS OF CHARACTER MIGHT BE SEEN IN COLONEL LLOYD'S SLAVES AS ARE SEEN IN THE SLAVES OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES
1425-139291-0023 THE SLAVES SELECTED TO GO TO THE GREAT HOUSE FARM FOR THE MONTHLY ALLOWANCE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FELLOW SLAVES WERE PECULIARLY ENTHUSIASTIC WHILE ON THEIR WAY THEY WOULD MAKE THE DENSE OLD WOODS FOR MILES AROUND REVERBERATE WITH THEIR WILD SONGS
1425-139291-0024 THEY WOULD COMPOSE AND SING AS THEY WENT ALONG CONSULTING NEITHER TIME NOR TUNE THE THOUGHT THAT CAME UP CAME OUT
1425-139291-0025 ESPECIALLY WOULD THEY DO THIS WHEN LEAVING HOME THEY WOULD THEN SING MOST EXULTINGLY THE FOLLOWING WORDS
1425-139291-0026 THAN THE READING OF WHOLE VOLUMES OF PHILOSOPHY ON THE SUBJECT COULD DO I DID NOT WHEN A SLAVE UNDERSTAND THE DEEP MEANING OF THOSE RUDE AND APPARENTLY INCOHERENT SONGS I WAS MYSELF WITHIN THE CIRCLE
1425-139291-0027 WITHOUT MIGHT SEE AND HEAR THEY TOLD A TALE OF WOE WHICH WAS THEN ALTOGETHER BEYOND MY FEEBLE COMPREHENSION THEY WERE TONES LOUD LONG AND DEEP THEY BREATHED THE PRAYER AND COMPLAINT OF SOULS BOILING OVER WITH THE BITTEREST ANGUISH
1425-139291-0028 EVERY TONE WAS A TESTIMONY AGAINST SLAVERY AND A PRAYER TO GOD FOR DELIVERANCE FROM CHAINS THE HEARING OF THOSE WILD NOTES ALWAYS DEPRESSED MY SPIRIT AND FILLED ME WITH INEFFABLE SADNESS I HAVE FREQUENTLY FOUND MYSELF IN TEARS WHILE HEARING THEM
1425-139291-0029 THE MERE RECURRENCE TO THOSE SONGS EVEN NOW AFFLICTS ME AND WHILE I AM WRITING THESE LINES AN EXPRESSION OF FEELING HAS ALREADY FOUND ITS WAY DOWN MY CHEEK
1425-139291-0030 I CAN NEVER GET RID OF THAT CONCEPTION
1425-139291-0031 AND QUICKEN MY SYMPATHIES FOR MY BRETHREN IN BONDS IF ANY ONE WISHES TO BE IMPRESSED WITH THE SOUL KILLING EFFECTS OF SLAVERY LET HIM GO TO COLONEL LLOYD'S PLANTATION AND ON ALLOWANCE DAY
1425-139291-0032 PLACE HIMSELF IN THE DEEP PINE WOODS AND THERE LET HIM IN SILENCE ANALYZE THE SOUNDS THAT SHALL PASS THROUGH THE CHAMBERS OF HIS SOUL AND IF HE IS NOT THUS IMPRESSED IT WILL ONLY BE BECAUSE THERE IS NO FLESH IN HIS OBDURATE HEART
1425-139291-0033 I HAVE OFTEN BEEN UTTERLY ASTONISHED SINCE I CAME TO THE NORTH TO FIND PERSONS WHO COULD SPEAK OF THE SINGING AMONG SLAVES AS EVIDENCE OF THEIR CONTENTMENT AND HAPPINESS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE OF A GREATER MISTAKE SLAVES SING MOST WHEN THEY ARE MOST UNHAPPY
1425-139291-0034 THE SONGS OF THE SLAVE REPRESENT THE SORROWS OF HIS HEART AND HE IS RELIEVED BY THEM ONLY AS AN ACHING HEART IS RELIEVED BY ITS TEARS AT LEAST SUCH IS MY EXPERIENCE I HAVE OFTEN SUNG TO DROWN MY SORROW BUT SELDOM TO EXPRESS MY HAPPINESS
