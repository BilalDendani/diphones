8322-276748-0073 STERLING PER POUND AN IMPORTANT MEASURE WAS ADOPTED ON FEBRUARY SEVENTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR THE OBJECT OF WHICH WAS TO REDUCE THE CURRENCY AND TO AUTHORIZE A NEW ISSUE OF NOTES AND BONDS

8322-276748-0077 PAYABLE IN SPECIE WERE PLEDGED A REVIEW OF THIS STATEMENT OF THE LEGISLATION OF CONGRESS WILL CLEARLY PRESENT THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM OF THE GOVERNMENT THE FIRST ACTION OF THE PROVISIONAL CONGRESS WAS CONFINED TO THE ADOPTION OF A TARIFF LAW
8322-276748-0078 AND AN ACT FOR A LOAN OF FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WITH A PLEDGE OF A SMALL EXPORT DUTY ON COTTON TO PROVIDE FOR THE REDEMPTION OF THE DEBT AT THE NEXT SESSION AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE WAR
8322-276748-0079 PROVISION WAS MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TREASURY NOTES AND FOR BORROWING THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS AT THE SAME TIME THE TARIFF WAS REVISED AND PREPARATORY MEASURES TAKEN FOR THE LEVY OF INTERNAL TAXES
8322-276748-0080 EARLY IN JULY EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE
8322-276748-0081 THERE AROSE THE NECESSITY THAT A FINANCIAL SYSTEM SHOULD BE DEVISED ON A BASIS SUFFICIENTLY LARGE FOR THE VAST PROPORTIONS OF THE APPROACHING CONTEST THE PLAN THEN ADOPTED WAS FOUNDED ON THE THEORY OF ISSUING TREASURY NOTES
8322-276748-0082 CONVERTIBLE AT THE PLEASURE OF THE HOLDER INTO EIGHT PER CENT BONDS WITH THE INTEREST PAYABLE IN COIN IT WAS ASSUMED THAT ANY TENDENCY TO DEPRECIATION
8322-276748-0083 WOULD BE CHECKED BY THE CONSTANT EXERCISE OF THE HOLDER'S RIGHT TO FUND THE NOTES AT A LIBERAL INTEREST PAYABLE IN SPECIE THE SUCCESS OF THIS SYSTEM DEPENDED ON THE ABILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT CONSTANTLY TO PAY THE INTEREST IN SPECIE
8322-276748-0084 TERMED A WAR TAX AND THE APPROPRIATION OF THE REVENUE FROM IMPORTS THE FIRST OPERATION OF THIS PLAN WAS QUITE SUCCESSFUL THE INTEREST WAS PAID FROM THE RESERVE OF COIN EXISTING IN THE COUNTRY
8322-276748-0085 AND EXPERIENCE SUSTAINED THE EXPECTATIONS OF THOSE WHO DEVISED THE SYSTEM WHEAT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO WAS SELLING AT ONE DOLLAR AND THIRTY CENTS PER BUSHEL
8322-276748-0086 THUS BUT LITTLE EXCEEDING ITS AVERAGE PRICE IN TIME OF PEACE THE OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS OF THE COUNTRY WERE AT SIMILARLY MODERATE RATES THUS INDICATING THAT THERE WAS NO EXCESS OF CIRCULATION
8322-276748-0087 AT THE SAME TIME THE PREMIUM ON COIN HAD REACHED ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT BUT IT HAD BECOME APPARENT THAT THE COMMERCE OF OUR COUNTRY WAS THREATENED WITH PERMANENT SUSPENSION BY REASON OF THE CONDUCT OF NEUTRAL NATIONS
8322-276748-0088 BY SANCTIONING ITS DECLARATION OF A BLOCKADE THESE NEUTRAL NATIONS TREATED OUR INVASION BY OUR FORMER LIMITED AND SPECIAL AGENT AS THOUGH IT WERE THE ATTEMPT OF A SOVEREIGN TO SUPPRESS A REBELLION AGAINST LAWFUL AUTHORITY
8322-276748-0089 THIS EXCEPTIONAL CAUSE HEIGHTENED THE PREMIUM ON SPECIE BECAUSE IT INDICATED THE EXHAUSTION OF OUR RESERVE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF RENEWING THE SUPPLY
8322-276748-0090 AT THE INAUGURATION OF THE PERMANENT GOVERNMENT IN FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO A POPULAR AVERSION TO INTERNAL TAXATION HAD BEEN SO STRONGLY MANIFESTED AS TO INDICATE ITS PARTIAL FAILURE
8322-276748-0091 THIS WILL BE FURTHER EXPLAINED PRESENTLY IN OUR STATEMENT OF THE SYSTEM OF TAXATION UNDER ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE EFFORT WAS MADE TO AVOID THE INCREASE IN THE VOLUME OF NOTES IN CIRCULATION
8322-276748-0092 BY OFFERING INDUCEMENTS TO VOLUNTARY FUNDING THE MEASURES ADOPTED FOR THAT PURPOSE WERE BUT PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL MEANWHILE THE INTERVENING EXIGENCIES FROM THE FORTUNES OF WAR PERMITTED NO DELAY
8322-276748-0093 THE ISSUES OF TREASURY NOTES WERE INCREASED UNTIL IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE THE CURRENCY IN CIRCULATION AMOUNTED TO MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
8322-276748-0094 OR MORE THAN THREEFOLD THE AMOUNT REQUIRED BY THE BUSINESS OF THE COUNTRY THE EVIL EFFECTS OF THIS FINANCIAL CONDITION WERE BUT TOO APPARENT IN ADDITION TO THE DIFFICULTY PRESENTED
8322-276748-0095 THAT IT BECAME OUR HIGHEST DUTY TO REMOVE THE CAUSE BY PROMPT AND STRINGENT MEASURES I THEREFORE RECOMMENDED TO CONGRESS IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE THE COMPULSORY REDUCTION
8322-276748-0096 OF THE CURRENCY TO THE AMOUNT REQUIRED BY THE BUSINESS OF THE COUNTRY ACCOMPANIED BY A PLEDGE THAT UNDER NO STRESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD THE AMOUNT BE INCREASED
8322-276748-0097 BUT BY THE VERY FACT OF THE LARGE AMOUNTS THUS MADE REQUISITE IN THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR THESE PRICES WOULD REACH RATES STILL MORE EXTRAVAGANT AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM WOULD FALL UNDER ITS OWN WEIGHT
8322-276748-0098 AND DESTROYING ITS VALUE IN THE HANDS OF THE HOLDER IF ON THE CONTRARY A FUNDED DEBT WITH INTEREST SECURED BY ADEQUATE TAXATION COULD BE SUBSTITUTED FOR THE OUTSTANDING CURRENCY ITS ENTIRE AMOUNT WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE HOLDER
8322-276748-0099 AND THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE IN A CONDITION BEYOND THE REACH OF ANY PROBABLE CONTINGENCY TO PROSECUTE THE WAR TO A SUCCESSFUL ISSUE THIS RECOMMENDATION WAS FOLLOWED BY THE PASSAGE OF THE ACT OF FEBRUARY SEVENTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR ABOVE MENTIONED
8322-276748-0100 REGARDING THE GOVERNMENT WHEN CONTRACTING A DEBT AS THE AGENT OF THE PEOPLE ITS DEBT IS THEIR DEBT AS THE CURRENCY WAS HELD EXCLUSIVELY BY OURSELVES
8322-276748-0101 IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT IF EACH PERSON HELD TREASURY NOTES IN EXACT PROPORTION TO THE VALUATION OF HIS WHOLE ESTATE EACH WOULD IN FACT OWE HIMSELF THE AMOUNT OF THE NOTES HELD BY HIM AND
8322-276748-0102 WERE IT POSSIBLE TO DISTRIBUTE THE CURRENCY AMONG THE PEOPLE IN THIS EXACT PROPORTION A TAX LEVIED ON THE CURRENCY ALONE TO AN AMOUNT SUFFICIENT TO REDUCE IT TO ITS PROPER LIMITS WOULD AFFORD THE BEST OF ALL REMEDIES
8322-276748-0103 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE NOTES REMAINING IN THE HANDS OF EACH HOLDER AFTER THE PAYMENT OF HIS TAX WOULD BE WORTH QUITE AS MUCH AS THE WHOLE SUM PREVIOUSLY HELD FOR IT WOULD HAVE AN EQUAL PURCHASING CAPACITY
8322-276748-0104 AFTER THIS LAW HAD BEEN IN OPERATION FOR ONE YEAR IT WAS MANIFEST THAT IT HAD THE DESIRED EFFECT OF WITHDRAWING FROM CIRCULATION THE LARGE EXCESS OF TREASURY NOTES WHICH HAD BEEN ISSUED ON JULY FIRST EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR
8322-276748-0105 THE OUTSTANDING AMOUNT WAS ESTIMATED AT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT FUNDED UNDER THIS ACT ABOUT THIS TIME WAS THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WHILE NEW NOTES WERE AUTHORIZED TO BE ISSUED
8322-276748-0106 TO THE EXTENT OF TWO THIRDS OF THE SUM RECEIVED UNDER ITS PROVISIONS THE CHIEF DIFFICULTY APPREHENDED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR FINANCES
8322-276748-0107 RESULTED FROM THE DEPRECIATION OF OUR TREASURY NOTES WHICH WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASING REDUNDANCY IN AMOUNT AND THE DIMINISHING CONFIDENCE IN THEIR ULTIMATE REDEMPTION
8322-276748-0108 THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT NEAR ITS CLOSE IS VERY CORRECTLY REPRESENTED IN THE REPORT OF THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS OF THE TREASURY FOR THE TWO QUARTERS
