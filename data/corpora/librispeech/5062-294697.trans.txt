5062-294697-0000 CHAPTER ELEVEN THE LETTER OF INTRODUCTION
5062-294697-0001 IT WAS AN INN OF NO GREAT SIZE BUT OF RESPECTABLE APPEARANCE IF I WAS TO BE OF ANY USE TO HER THAT NIGHT THE TIME HAD COME TO SPEAK OF OTHER SUBJECTS THAN THE SUBJECT OF DREAMS
5062-294697-0002 ONLY LET ME HEAR HOW I CAN RELIEVE YOUR MOST PRESSING ANXIETIES WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS CAN I DO ANYTHING TO HELP THEM BEFORE YOU GO TO REST TO NIGHT SHE THANKED ME WARMLY AND HESITATED
5062-294697-0003 LOOKING UP THE STREET AND DOWN THE STREET IN EVIDENT EMBARRASSMENT WHAT TO SAY NEXT DO YOU PROPOSE STAYING IN EDINBURGH I ASKED OH NO I DON'T WISH TO REMAIN IN SCOTLAND I WANT TO GO MUCH FURTHER AWAY
5062-294697-0004 I THINK I SHOULD DO BETTER IN LONDON AT SOME RESPECTABLE MILLINER'S IF I COULD BE PROPERLY RECOMMENDED I AM QUICK AT MY NEEDLE AND I UNDERSTAND CUTTING OUT OR I COULD KEEP ACCOUNTS IF IF ANYBODY WOULD TRUST ME
5062-294697-0005 SHE STOPPED AND LOOKED AT ME DOUBTINGLY AS IF SHE FELT FAR FROM SURE POOR SOUL OF WINNING MY CONFIDENCE TO BEGIN WITH I ACTED ON THAT HINT WITH THE HEADLONG IMPETUOSITY OF A MAN WHO WAS IN LOVE
5062-294697-0006 I CAN GIVE YOU EXACTLY THE RECOMMENDATION YOU WANT I SAID WHENEVER YOU LIKE NOW IF YOU WOULD PREFER IT HER CHARMING FEATURES BRIGHTENED WITH PLEASURE OH YOU ARE INDEED A FRIEND TO ME SHE SAID IMPULSIVELY
5062-294697-0007 HER FACE CLOUDED AGAIN SHE SAW MY PROPOSAL IN A NEW LIGHT HAVE I ANY RIGHT SHE ASKED SADLY TO ACCEPT WHAT YOU OFFER ME LET ME GIVE YOU THE LETTER I ANSWERED AND YOU CAN DECIDE FOR YOURSELF WHETHER YOU WILL USE IT OR NOT
5062-294697-0008 I PUT HER ARM AGAIN IN MINE AND ENTERED THE INN SHE SHRUNK BACK IN ALARM WHAT WOULD THE LANDLADY THINK IF SHE SAW HER LODGER ENTER THE HOUSE AT NIGHT IN COMPANY WITH A STRANGER AND THAT STRANGER A GENTLEMAN
5062-294697-0009 THE LANDLADY APPEARED AS SHE MADE THE OBJECTION RECKLESS WHAT I SAID OR WHAT I DID I INTRODUCED MYSELF AS HER RELATIVE AND ASKED TO BE SHOWN INTO A QUIET ROOM IN WHICH I COULD WRITE A LETTER
5062-294697-0010 AFTER ONE SHARP GLANCE AT ME THE LANDLADY APPEARED TO BE SATISFIED THAT SHE WAS DEALING WITH A GENTLEMAN SHE LED THE WAY INTO A SORT OF PARLOR BEHIND THE BAR PLACED WRITING MATERIALS ON THE TABLE LOOKED AT MY COMPANION
5062-294697-0011 AS ONLY ONE WOMAN CAN LOOK AT ANOTHER UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND LEFT US BY OURSELVES IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER BEEN IN A ROOM WITH HER ALONE THE EMBARRASSING SENSE OF HER POSITION
5062-294697-0012 HAD HEIGHTENED HER COLOR AND BRIGHTENED HER EYES SHE STOOD LEANING ONE HAND ON THE TABLE CONFUSED AND IRRESOLUTE HER FIRM AND SUPPLE FIGURE FALLING INTO AN ATTITUDE OF UNSOUGHT GRACE
5062-294697-0013 WHICH IT WAS LITERALLY A LUXURY TO LOOK AT I SAID NOTHING MY EYES CONFESSED MY ADMIRATION THE WRITING MATERIALS LAY UNTOUCHED BEFORE ME ON THE TABLE HOW LONG THE SILENCE MIGHT HAVE LASTED I CANNOT SAY
5062-294697-0014 SHE ABRUPTLY BROKE IT HER INSTINCT WARNED HER THAT SILENCE MIGHT HAVE ITS DANGERS IN OUR POSITION SHE TURNED TO ME WITH AN EFFORT SHE SAID UNEASILY I DON'T THINK YOU OUGHT TO WRITE YOUR LETTER TO NIGHT SIR
5062-294697-0015 WHY NOT YOU KNOW NOTHING OF ME SURELY YOU OUGHT NOT TO RECOMMEND A PERSON WHO IS A STRANGER TO YOU AND I AM WORSE THAN A STRANGER I AM A MISERABLE WRETCH WHO HAS TRIED TO COMMIT A GREAT SIN
5062-294697-0016 PERHAPS THE MISERY I WAS IN MIGHT BE SOME EXCUSE FOR ME IF YOU KNEW IT YOU OUGHT TO KNOW IT BUT IT'S SO LATE TO NIGHT AND I AM SO SADLY TIRED
5062-294697-0017 IN THE PRESENCE OF A MAN HER HEAD SUNK ON HER BOSOM HER DELICATE LIPS TREMBLED A LITTLE SHE SAID NO MORE THE WAY TO REASSURE AND CONSOLE HER LAY PLAINLY ENOUGH BEFORE ME IF I CHOSE TO TAKE IT WITHOUT STOPPING TO THINK
5062-294697-0018 I TOOK IT REMINDING HER THAT SHE HAD HERSELF PROPOSED WRITING TO ME WHEN WE MET THAT EVENING I SUGGESTED THAT SHE SHOULD WAIT TO TELL THE SAD STORY OF HER TROUBLES UNTIL IT WAS CONVENIENT TO HER TO SEND ME THE NARRATIVE IN THE FORM OF A LETTER
5062-294697-0019 IN THE MEAN TIME I ADDED I HAVE THE MOST PERFECT CONFIDENCE IN YOU AND I BEG AS A FAVOR THAT YOU WILL LET ME PUT IT TO THE PROOF I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO A DRESSMAKER IN LONDON WHO IS AT THE HEAD OF A LARGE ESTABLISHMENT
5062-294697-0020 AND I WILL DO IT BEFORE I LEAVE YOU TO NIGHT I DIPPED MY PEN IN THE INK AS I SAID THE WORDS LET ME CONFESS FRANKLY THE LENGTHS TO WHICH MY INFATUATION LED ME THE DRESSMAKER TO WHOM I HAD ALLUDED
5062-294697-0021 AND HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED IN BUSINESS WITH MONEY LENT BY MY LATE STEP FATHER MISTER GERMAINE I USED BOTH THEIR NAMES WITHOUT SCRUPLE AND I WROTE MY RECOMMENDATION IN TERMS WHICH THE BEST OF LIVING WOMEN
5062-294697-0022 AND THE ABLEST OF EXISTING DRESSMAKERS COULD NEVER HAVE HOPED TO MERIT WILL ANYBODY FIND EXCUSES FOR ME THOSE RARE PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN IN LOVE AND WHO HAVE NOT COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN IT YET MAY PERHAPS FIND EXCUSES FOR ME
5062-294697-0023 IT MATTERS LITTLE I DON'T DESERVE THEM I HANDED HER THE OPEN LETTER TO READ SHE BLUSHED DELIGHTFULLY SHE CAST ONE TENDERLY GRATEFUL LOOK AT ME WHICH I REMEMBERED BUT TOO WELL FOR MANY AND MANY
5062-294697-0024 AN AFTER DAY THE NEXT MOMENT TO MY ASTONISHMENT THIS CHANGEABLE CREATURE CHANGED AGAIN SOME FORGOTTEN CONSIDERATION SEEMED TO HAVE OCCURRED TO HER SHE TURNED PALE THE SOFT LINES OF PLEASURE IN HER FACE HARDENED
5062-294697-0025 LITTLE BY LITTLE SHE REGARDED ME WITH THE SADDEST LOOK OF CONFUSION AND DISTRESS PUTTING THE LETTER DOWN BEFORE ME ON THE TABLE SHE SAID TIMIDLY WOULD YOU MIND ADDING A POSTSCRIPT SIR
5062-294697-0026 I SUPPRESSED ALL APPEARANCE OF SURPRISE AS WELL AS I COULD AND TOOK UP THE PEN AGAIN WOULD YOU PLEASE SAY SHE WENT ON THAT I AM ONLY TO BE TAKEN ON TRIAL AT FIRST I AM NOT TO BE ENGAGED FOR MORE
5062-294697-0027 HER VOICE SUNK LOWER AND LOWER SO THAT I COULD BARELY HEAR THE NEXT WORDS FOR MORE THAN THREE MONTHS CERTAIN IT WAS NOT IN HUMAN NATURE PERHAPS I OUGHT TO SAY IT WAS NOT IN THE NATURE OF A MAN WHO WAS IN MY SITUATION
5062-294697-0028 TO REFRAIN FROM SHOWING SOME CURIOSITY ON BEING ASKED TO SUPPLEMENT A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION BY SUCH A POSTSCRIPT AS THIS HAVE YOU SOME OTHER EMPLOYMENT IN PROSPECT I ASKED NONE SHE ANSWERED WITH HER HEAD DOWN AND HER EYES AVOIDING MINE
5062-294697-0029 AN UNWORTHY DOUBT OF HER THE MEAN OFFSPRING OF JEALOUSY FOUND ITS WAY INTO MY MIND HAVE YOU SOME ABSENT FRIEND I WENT ON WHO IS LIKELY TO PROVE A BETTER FRIEND THAN I AM IF YOU ONLY GIVE HIM TIME
5062-294697-0030 SHE LIFTED HER NOBLE HEAD HER GRAND GUILELESS GRAY EYES RESTED ON ME WITH A LOOK OF PATIENT REPROACH I HAVE NOT GOT A FRIEND IN THE WORLD SHE SAID FOR GOD'S SAKE ASK ME NO MORE QUESTIONS TO NIGHT
5062-294697-0031 I ROSE AND GAVE HER THE LETTER ONCE MORE WITH THE POSTSCRIPT ADDED IN HER OWN WORDS WE STOOD TOGETHER BY THE TABLE WE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN A MOMENTARY SILENCE HOW CAN I THANK YOU SHE MURMURED SOFTLY
5062-294697-0032 OH SIR I WILL INDEED BE WORTHY OF THE CONFIDENCE THAT YOU HAVE SHOWN IN ME HER EYES MOISTENED HER VARIABLE COLOR CAME AND WENT HER DRESS HEAVED SOFTLY OVER THE LOVELY OUTLINE OF HER BOSOM
5062-294697-0033 I DON'T BELIEVE THE MAN LIVES WHO COULD HAVE RESISTED HER AT THAT MOMENT I LOST ALL POWER OF RESTRAINT I CAUGHT HER IN MY ARMS I WHISPERED I LOVE YOU I KISSED HER PASSIONATELY
5062-294697-0034 FOR A MOMENT SHE LAY HELPLESS AND TREMBLING ON MY BREAST FOR A MOMENT HER FRAGRANT LIPS SOFTLY RETURNED THE KISS IN AN INSTANT MORE IT WAS OVER SHE TORE HERSELF AWAY WITH A SHUDDER THAT SHOOK HER FROM HEAD TO FOOT
5062-294697-0035 AND THREW THE LETTER THAT I HAD GIVEN TO HER INDIGNANTLY AT MY FEET HOW DARE YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME HOW DARE YOU TOUCH ME SHE SAID TAKE YOUR LETTER BACK SIR I REFUSE TO RECEIVE IT
5062-294697-0036 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE DONE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW DEEPLY YOU HAVE WOUNDED ME OH SHE CRIED THROWING HERSELF IN DESPAIR ON A SOFA THAT STOOD NEAR HER SHALL I EVER RECOVER MY SELF RESPECT SHALL I EVER FORGIVE MYSELF
5062-294697-0037 FOR WHAT I HAVE DONE TO NIGHT I IMPLORED HER PARDON I ASSURED HER OF MY REPENTANCE AND REGRET IN WORDS WHICH DID REALLY COME FROM MY HEART THE VIOLENCE OF HER AGITATION MORE THAN DISTRESSED ME
5062-294697-0038 I WAS REALLY ALARMED BY IT SHE COMPOSED HERSELF AFTER A WHILE SHE ROSE TO HER FEET WITH MODEST DIGNITY AND SILENTLY HELD OUT HER HAND IN TOKEN THAT MY REPENTANCE WAS ACCEPTED
5062-294697-0039 YOU WILL GIVE ME TIME FOR ATONEMENT I PLEADED YOU WILL NOT LOSE ALL CONFIDENCE IN ME
5062-294697-0040 AT YOUR OWN TIME IN THE PRESENCE OF ANOTHER PERSON IF YOU LIKE I WILL WRITE TO YOU SHE SAID TO MORROW TO MORROW I TOOK UP THE LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION FROM THE FLOOR
5062-294697-0041 MAKE YOUR GOODNESS TO ME COMPLETE I SAID DON'T MORTIFY ME BY REFUSING TO TAKE MY LETTER I WILL TAKE YOUR LETTER SHE ANSWERED QUIETLY THANK YOU FOR WRITING IT LEAVE ME NOW PLEASE GOOD NIGHT
5062-294697-0042 I LEFT HER PALE AND SAD WITH MY LETTER IN HER HAND
5062-294697-0043 WHICH GRADUALLY RESOLVED THEMSELVES INTO TWO MASTER FEELINGS AS I WALKED ON LOVE THAT ADORED HER MORE FERVENTLY THAN EVER AND HOPE
