1696-142314-0000 NAMELY SINCE THAT ANOTHER MAY BE GLAD WITH THAT THAT THUS IN SORROW MAKES ME SAD WYATT MARGARET HAD NOT EXPECTED MUCH PLEASURE TO HERSELF FROM MISTER BELL'S VISIT SHE HAD ONLY LOOKED FORWARD TO IT ON HER FATHER'S ACCOUNT
1696-142314-0001 BUT WHEN HER GODFATHER CAME SHE AT ONCE FELL INTO THE MOST NATURAL POSITION OF FRIENDSHIP IN THE WORLD HE SAID SHE HAD NO MERIT IN BEING WHAT SHE WAS A GIRL SO ENTIRELY AFTER HIS OWN HEART IT WAS AN HEREDITARY POWER WHICH SHE HAD TO WALK IN AND TAKE POSSESSION OF HIS REGARD
1696-142314-0002 WHILE SHE IN REPLY GAVE HIM MUCH CREDIT FOR BEING SO FRESH AND YOUNG UNDER HIS FELLOW'S CAP AND GOWN FRESH AND YOUNG IN WARMTH AND KINDNESS I MEAN I'M AFRAID I MUST OWN THAT I THINK YOUR OPINIONS ARE THE OLDEST AND MUSTIEST I HAVE MET WITH THIS LONG TIME
1696-142314-0003 HEAR THIS DAUGHTER OF YOURS HALE HER RESIDENCE IN MILTON HAS QUITE CORRUPTED HER SHE'S A DEMOCRAT A RED REPUBLICAN A MEMBER OF THE PEACE SOCIETY A SOCIALIST PAPA IT'S ALL BECAUSE I'M STANDING UP FOR THE PROGRESS OF COMMERCE
1696-142314-0004 MISTER BELL WOULD HAVE HAD IT KEEP STILL AT EXCHANGING WILD BEAST SKINS FOR ACORNS NO NO I'D DIG THE GROUND AND GROW POTATOES AND I'D SHAVE THE WILD BEAST SKINS AND MAKE THE WOOL INTO BROAD CLOTH DON'T EXAGGERATE MISSY
1696-142314-0005 EVERYBODY RUSHING OVER EVERYBODY IN THEIR HURRY TO GET RICH IT IS NOT EVERY ONE WHO CAN SIT COMFORTABLY IN A SET OF COLLEGE ROOMS AND LET HIS RICHES GROW WITHOUT ANY EXERTION OF HIS OWN
1696-142314-0006 WITHOUT HIS TAKING ANY TROUBLE ABOUT IT SAID MISTER HALE I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD IT'S THE BUSTLE AND THE STRUGGLE THEY LIKE AS FOR SITTING STILL AND LEARNING FROM THE PAST OR SHAPING OUT THE FUTURE BY FAITHFUL WORK DONE IN A PROPHETIC SPIRIT
1696-142314-0007 WHY POOH I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S A MAN IN MILTON WHO KNOWS HOW TO SIT STILL AND IT IS A GREAT ART MILTON PEOPLE I SUSPECT THINK OXFORD MEN DON'T KNOW HOW TO MOVE IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING IF THEY MIXED A LITTLE MORE
1696-142314-0008 IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR THE MILTONERS MANY THINGS MIGHT BE GOOD FOR THEM WHICH WOULD BE VERY DISAGREEABLE FOR OTHER PEOPLE ARE YOU NOT A MILTON MAN YOURSELF ASKED MARGARET
1696-142314-0009 I CONFESS I DON'T SEE WHAT THERE IS TO BE PROUD OF
1696-142314-0010 WELL SAID MISTER HALE MISTER THORNTON IS COMING TO DRINK TEA WITH US TO NIGHT AND HE IS AS PROUD OF MILTON AS YOU OF OXFORD YOU TWO MUST TRY AND MAKE EACH OTHER A LITTLE MORE LIBERAL MINDED I DON'T WANT TO BE MORE LIBERAL MINDED THANK YOU SAID MISTER BELL
1696-142314-0011 ASKED MARGARET IN A LOW VOICE EITHER TO TEA OR SOON AFTER HE COULD NOT TELL HE TOLD US NOT TO WAIT MISTER THORNTON HAD DETERMINED
1696-142314-0012 THAT HE WOULD MAKE NO INQUIRY OF HIS MOTHER AS TO HOW FAR SHE HAD PUT HER PROJECT INTO EXECUTION OF SPEAKING TO MARGARET ABOUT THE IMPROPRIETY OF HER CONDUCT HE FELT PRETTY SURE THAT IF THIS INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE HIS MOTHER'S ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED AT IT WOULD ONLY ANNOY AND CHAGRIN HIM
1696-142314-0013 THOUGH HE WOULD ALL THE TIME BE AWARE OF THE COLOURING WHICH IT RECEIVED BY PASSING THROUGH HER MIND HE SHRANK FROM HEARING MARGARET'S VERY NAME MENTIONED HE WHILE HE BLAMED HER WHILE HE WAS JEALOUS OF HER WHILE HE RENOUNCED HER
1696-142314-0014 HE DREAMT OF HER HE DREAMT SHE CAME DANCING TOWARDS HIM WITH OUTSPREAD ARMS
1696-142314-0015 EVEN WHILE IT ALLURED HIM BUT THE IMPRESSION OF THIS FIGURE OF MARGARET WITH ALL MARGARET'S CHARACTER TAKEN OUT OF IT AS COMPLETELY AS IF SOME EVIL SPIRIT HAD GOT POSSESSION OF HER FORM WAS SO DEEPLY STAMPED UPON HIS IMAGINATION
1696-142314-0016 THAT WHEN HE WAKENED HE FELT HARDLY ABLE TO SEPARATE THE UNA FROM THE DUESSA AND THE DISLIKE HE HAD TO THE LATTER SEEMED TO ENVELOPE AND DISFIGURE THE FORMER YET HE WAS TOO PROUD TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS WEAKNESS BY AVOIDING THE SIGHT OF HER
1696-142314-0017 HE WOULD NEITHER SEEK AN OPPORTUNITY OF BEING IN HER COMPANY NOR AVOID IT
1696-142314-0018 HE LINGERED OVER EVERY PIECE OF BUSINESS THIS AFTERNOON HE FORCED EVERY MOVEMENT INTO UNNATURAL SLOWNESS AND DELIBERATION
1696-142314-0019 THEN THERE WERE BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS TO BE TRANSACTED IN THE STUDY WITH MISTER BELL AND THE LATTER KEPT ON SITTING OVER THE FIRE AND TALKING WEARILY LONG AFTER ALL BUSINESS WAS TRANSACTED AND WHEN THEY MIGHT JUST AS WELL HAVE GONE UPSTAIRS
1696-142314-0020 BUT MISTER THORNTON WOULD NOT SAY A WORD ABOUT MOVING THEIR QUARTERS HE CHAFED AND CHAFED AND THOUGHT MISTER BELL A MOST PROSY COMPANION WHILE MISTER BELL RETURNED THE COMPLIMENT IN SECRET BY CONSIDERING MISTER THORNTON ABOUT AS BRUSQUE AND CURT A FELLOW AS HE HAD EVER MET WITH
1696-142314-0021 AND TERRIBLY GONE OFF BOTH IN INTELLIGENCE AND MANNER AT LAST SOME SLIGHT NOISE IN THE ROOM ABOVE SUGGESTED THE DESIRABLENESS OF MOVING THERE THEY FOUND MARGARET WITH A LETTER OPEN BEFORE HER EAGERLY DISCUSSING ITS CONTENTS WITH HER FATHER
1696-142314-0022 ON THE ENTRANCE OF THE GENTLEMEN IT WAS IMMEDIATELY PUT ASIDE
1696-142314-0023 A LETTER FROM HENRY LENNOX IT MAKES MARGARET VERY HOPEFUL MISTER BELL NODDED
1696-142314-0024 WE WERE THINKING SAID MISTER HALE THAT YOU AND MISTER THORNTON HAD TAKEN MARGARET'S ADVICE AND WERE EACH TRYING TO CONVERT THE OTHER YOU WERE SO LONG IN THE STUDY AND YOU THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE NOTHING LEFT OF US BUT AN OPINION
1696-142314-0025 PRAY WHOSE OPINION DID YOU THINK WOULD HAVE THE MOST OBSTINATE VITALITY MISTER THORNTON HAD NOT A NOTION WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT AND DISDAINED TO INQUIRE MISTER HALE POLITELY ENLIGHTENED HIM MISTER THORNTON
1696-142314-0026 WE WERE ACCUSING MISTER BELL THIS MORNING OF A KIND OF OXONIAN MEDIAEVAL BIGOTRY AGAINST HIS NATIVE TOWN AND WE MARGARET I BELIEVE
1696-142314-0027 I BEG YOUR PARDON MARGARET THOUGHT IT WOULD DO THE MILTON MANUFACTURERS GOOD TO ASSOCIATE A LITTLE MORE WITH OXFORD MEN NOW WASN'T IT SO MARGARET I BELIEVE I THOUGHT IT WOULD DO BOTH GOOD TO SEE A LITTLE MORE OF THE OTHER
1696-142314-0028 AND SO YOU SEE MISTER THORNTON
1696-142314-0029 INSTEAD OF TALKING OVER VANISHED FAMILIES OF SMITHS AND HARRISONS
1696-142314-0030 ALL YOUR LIVES SEEM TO BE SPENT IN GATHERING TOGETHER THE MATERIALS FOR LIFE BY LIVING I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN ENJOYMENT YES ENJOYMENT I DON'T SPECIFY OF WHAT BECAUSE I TRUST WE SHOULD BOTH CONSIDER MERE PLEASURE AS VERY POOR ENJOYMENT
1696-142314-0031 I WOULD RATHER HAVE THE NATURE OF THE ENJOYMENT DEFINED WELL ENJOYMENT OF LEISURE ENJOYMENT OF THE POWER AND INFLUENCE WHICH MONEY GIVES YOU ARE ALL STRIVING FOR MONEY WHAT DO YOU WANT IT FOR
1696-142314-0032 MISTER THORNTON WAS SILENT THEN HE SAID I REALLY DON'T KNOW BUT MONEY IS NOT WHAT I STRIVE FOR WHAT THEN IT IS A HOME QUESTION
1696-142314-0033 I SHALL HAVE TO LAY MYSELF OPEN TO SUCH A CATECHIST AND I AM NOT SURE THAT I AM PREPARED TO DO IT NO SAID MISTER HALE DON'T LET US BE PERSONAL IN OUR CATECHISM YOU ARE NEITHER OF YOU REPRESENTATIVE MEN YOU ARE EACH OF YOU TOO INDIVIDUAL FOR THAT
1696-142314-0034 I AM NOT SURE WHETHER TO CONSIDER THAT AS A COMPLIMENT OR NOT I SHOULD LIKE TO BE THE REPRESENTATIVE OF OXFORD WITH ITS BEAUTY AND ITS LEARNING AND ITS PROUD OLD HISTORY
1696-142314-0035 I DON'T KNOW OXFORD BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A CITY AND THE REPRESENTATIVE MAN OF ITS INHABITANTS VERY TRUE MISS MARGARET NOW I REMEMBER
1696-142314-0036 YOU WERE AGAINST ME THIS MORNING AND WERE QUITE MILTONIAN AND MANUFACTURING IN YOUR PREFERENCES MARGARET SAW THE QUICK GLANCE OF SURPRISE THAT MISTER THORNTON GAVE HER AND SHE WAS ANNOYED AT THE CONSTRUCTION WHICH HE MIGHT PUT ON THIS SPEECH OF MISTER BELL'S MISTER BELL WENT ON
1696-142314-0037 AH I WISH I COULD SHOW YOU OUR HIGH STREET OUR RADCLIFFE SQUARE I AM LEAVING OUT OUR COLLEGES JUST AS I GIVE MISTER THORNTON LEAVE TO OMIT HIS FACTORIES IN SPEAKING OF THE CHARMS OF MILTON I HAVE A RIGHT TO ABUSE MY BIRTH PLACE REMEMBER I AM A MILTON MAN
1696-142314-0038 HE WAS NOT IN A MOOD FOR JOKING
1696-142314-0039 BUT NOW HE WAS GALLED ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT TO DEFEND WHAT WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE SERIOUSLY ATTACKED I DON'T SET UP MILTON AS A MODEL OF A TOWN NOT IN ARCHITECTURE SLYLY ASKED MISTER BELL
1696-142314-0040 NO WE'VE BEEN TOO BUSY TO ATTEND TO MERE OUTWARD APPEARANCES DON'T SAY MERE OUTWARD APPEARANCES SAID MISTER HALE GENTLY THEY IMPRESS US ALL FROM CHILDHOOD UPWARD EVERY DAY OF OUR LIFE WAIT A LITTLE WHILE SAID MISTER THORNTON
1696-142314-0041 REMEMBER WE ARE OF A DIFFERENT RACE FROM THE GREEKS TO WHOM BEAUTY WAS EVERYTHING AND TO WHOM MISTER BELL MIGHT SPEAK OF A LIFE OF LEISURE AND SERENE ENJOYMENT MUCH OF WHICH ENTERED IN THROUGH THEIR OUTWARD SENSES I DON'T MEAN TO DESPISE THEM ANY MORE THAN I WOULD APE THEM
1696-142314-0042 BUT I BELONG TO TEUTONIC BLOOD IT IS LITTLE MINGLED IN THIS PART OF ENGLAND TO WHAT IT IS IN OTHERS WE RETAIN MUCH OF THEIR LANGUAGE WE RETAIN MORE OF THEIR SPIRIT WE DO NOT LOOK UPON LIFE AS A TIME FOR ENJOYMENT BUT AS A TIME FOR ACTION AND EXERTION
1696-142314-0043 OUR GLORY AND OUR BEAUTY ARISE OUT OF OUR INWARD STRENGTH WHICH MAKES US VICTORIOUS OVER MATERIAL RESISTANCE AND OVER GREATER DIFFICULTIES STILL WE ARE TEUTONIC UP HERE IN DARKSHIRE IN ANOTHER WAY
1696-142314-0044 WE HATE TO HAVE LAWS MADE FOR US AT A DISTANCE WE WISH PEOPLE WOULD ALLOW US TO RIGHT OURSELVES INSTEAD OF CONTINUALLY MEDDLING WITH THEIR IMPERFECT LEGISLATION WE STAND UP FOR SELF GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSE CENTRALISATION IN SHORT
1696-142314-0045 YOU WOULD LIKE THE HEPTARCHY BACK AGAIN WELL AT ANY RATE I REVOKE WHAT I SAID THIS MORNING THAT YOU MILTON PEOPLE DID NOT REVERENCE THE PAST YOU ARE REGULAR WORSHIPPERS OF THOR IF WE DO NOT REVERENCE THE PAST AS YOU DO IN OXFORD
1696-142314-0046 WHICH IS FULL OF DIFFICULTIES THAT MUST BE ENCOUNTERED AND UPON THE MODE IN WHICH THEY ARE MET AND CONQUERED NOT MERELY PUSHED ASIDE FOR THE TIME DEPENDS OUR FUTURE OUT OF THE WISDOM OF THE PAST HELP US OVER THE PRESENT
1696-142314-0047 AND YET THIS LAST STRIKE UNDER WHICH I AM SMARTING HAS BEEN RESPECTABLE A RESPECTABLE STRIKE SAID MISTER BELL THAT SOUNDS AS IF YOU WERE FAR GONE IN THE WORSHIP OF THOR MARGARET FELT RATHER THAN SAW
1696-142314-0048 THAT MISTER THORNTON WAS CHAGRINED BY THE REPEATED TURNING INTO JEST OF WHAT HE WAS FEELING AS VERY SERIOUS SHE TRIED TO CHANGE THE CONVERSATION FROM A SUBJECT ABOUT WHICH ONE PARTY CARED LITTLE WHILE TO THE OTHER IT WAS DEEPLY BECAUSE PERSONALLY INTERESTING
1696-142314-0049 SHE FORCED HERSELF TO SAY SOMETHING EDITH SAYS SHE FINDS THE PRINTED CALICOES IN CORFU BETTER AND CHEAPER THAN IN LONDON DOES SHE SAID HER FATHER I THINK THAT MUST BE ONE OF EDITH'S EXAGGERATIONS ARE YOU SURE OF IT MARGARET
1696-142314-0050 THEN I AM SURE OF THE FACT SAID MISTER BELL MARGARET
1696-142314-0051 I DON'T BELIEVE A COUSIN OF YOURS COULD EXAGGERATE IS MISS HALE SO REMARKABLE FOR TRUTH SAID MISTER THORNTON BITTERLY THE MOMENT HE HAD DONE SO HE COULD HAVE BITTEN HIS TONGUE OUT WHAT WAS HE
1696-142314-0052 AND WHY SHOULD HE STAB HER WITH HER SHAME IN THIS WAY HOW EVIL HE WAS TO NIGHT POSSESSED BY ILL HUMOUR AT BEING DETAINED SO LONG FROM HER
1696-142314-0053 NOW ILL TEMPERED BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO COPE WITH A LIGHT HEART AGAINST ONE WHO WAS TRYING BY GAY AND CARELESS SPEECHES TO MAKE THE EVENING PASS PLEASANTLY AWAY THE KIND OLD FRIEND TO ALL PARTIES WHOSE MANNER BY THIS TIME MIGHT BE WELL KNOWN TO MISTER THORNTON
1696-142314-0054 WHO HAD BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH HIM FOR MANY YEARS AND THEN TO SPEAK TO MARGARET AS HE HAD DONE SHE DID NOT GET UP AND LEAVE THE ROOM AS SHE HAD DONE IN FORMER DAYS WHEN HIS ABRUPTNESS OR HIS TEMPER HAD ANNOYED HER SHE SAT QUITE STILL
1696-142314-0055 AFTER THE FIRST MOMENTARY GLANCE OF GRIEVED SURPRISE THAT MADE HER EYES LOOK LIKE SOME CHILD'S WHO HAS MET WITH AN UNEXPECTED REBUFF THEY SLOWLY DILATED INTO MOURNFUL REPROACHFUL SADNESS AND THEN THEY FELL
1696-142314-0056 AND SHE BENT OVER HER WORK AND DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN
1696-142314-0057 AS IF SHE QUIVERED IN SOME UNWONTED CHILL HE FELT AS THE MOTHER WOULD HAVE DONE IN THE MIDST OF HER ROCKING IT AND RATING IT HAD SHE BEEN CALLED AWAY BEFORE HER SLOW CONFIDING SMILE IMPLYING PERFECT TRUST IN MOTHER'S LOVE HAD PROVED THE RENEWING OF ITS LOVE
1696-142314-0058 HE GAVE SHORT SHARP ANSWERS HE WAS UNEASY AND CROSS UNABLE TO DISCERN BETWEEN JEST AND EARNEST ANXIOUS ONLY FOR A LOOK A WORD OF HERS BEFORE WHICH TO PROSTRATE HIMSELF IN PENITENT HUMILITY
1696-142314-0059 BUT SHE NEITHER LOOKED NOR SPOKE HER ROUND TAPER FINGERS FLEW IN AND OUT OF HER SEWING AS STEADILY AND SWIFTLY AS IF THAT WERE THE BUSINESS OF HER LIFE SHE COULD NOT CARE FOR HIM HE THOUGHT
1696-142314-0060 OR ELSE THE PASSIONATE FERVOUR OF HIS WISH WOULD HAVE FORCED HER TO RAISE THOSE EYES IF BUT FOR AN INSTANT TO READ THE LATE REPENTANCE IN HIS HE COULD HAVE STRUCK HER BEFORE HE LEFT IN ORDER THAT BY SOME STRANGE OVERT ACT OF RUDENESS
1696-142314-0061 HE MIGHT EARN THE PRIVILEGE OF TELLING HER THE REMORSE THAT GNAWED AT HIS HEART IT WAS WELL THAT THE LONG WALK IN THE OPEN AIR WOUND UP THIS EVENING FOR HIM IT SOBERED HIM BACK INTO GRAVE RESOLUTION THAT HENCEFORTH HE WOULD SEE AS LITTLE OF HER AS POSSIBLE
1696-142314-0062 SINCE THE VERY SIGHT OF THAT FACE AND FORM THE VERY SOUNDS OF THAT VOICE LIKE THE SOFT WINDS OF PURE MELODY HAD SUCH POWER TO MOVE HIM FROM HIS BALANCE WELL HE HAD KNOWN WHAT LOVE WAS A SHARP PANG A FIERCE EXPERIENCE
1696-142314-0063 IN THE MIDST OF WHOSE FLAMES HE WAS STRUGGLING BUT THROUGH THAT FURNACE HE WOULD FIGHT HIS WAY OUT INTO THE SERENITY OF MIDDLE AGE ALL THE RICHER AND MORE HUMAN FOR HAVING KNOWN THIS GREAT PASSION WHEN HE HAD SOMEWHAT ABRUPTLY LEFT THE ROOM
1696-142314-0064 MARGARET ROSE FROM HER SEAT AND BEGAN SILENTLY TO FOLD UP HER WORK THE LONG SEAMS WERE HEAVY AND HAD AN UNUSUAL WEIGHT FOR HER LANGUID ARMS THE ROUND LINES IN HER FACE TOOK A LENGTHENED STRAIGHTER FORM
1696-142314-0065 AND HER WHOLE APPEARANCE WAS THAT OF ONE WHO HAD GONE THROUGH A DAY OF GREAT FATIGUE AS THE THREE PREPARED FOR BED MISTER BELL MUTTERED FORTH A LITTLE CONDEMNATION OF MISTER THORNTON I NEVER SAW A FELLOW SO SPOILED BY SUCCESS
1696-142314-0066 HE CAN'T BEAR A WORD A JEST OF ANY KIND EVERYTHING SEEMS TO TOUCH ON THE SORENESS OF HIS HIGH DIGNITY FORMERLY HE WAS AS SIMPLE AND NOBLE AS THE OPEN DAY
1696-142314-0067 BECAUSE HE HAD NO VANITY HE IS NOT VAIN NOW SAID MARGARET
1696-142314-0068 TO NIGHT HE HAS NOT BEEN LIKE HIMSELF SOMETHING MUST HAVE ANNOYED HIM BEFORE HE CAME HERE
1696-142314-0069 SHE STOOD IT QUITE CALMLY BUT AFTER SHE HAD LEFT THE ROOM HE SUDDENLY ASKED HALE
1696-142314-0070 HAVE WHAT THE FRENCH CALL A TENDRESSE FOR EACH OTHER
1696-142314-0071 NO I AM SURE YOU ARE WRONG I AM ALMOST CERTAIN YOU ARE MISTAKEN IF THERE IS ANYTHING IT IS ALL ON MISTER THORNTON'S SIDE POOR FELLOW I HOPE AND TRUST HE IS NOT THINKING OF HER FOR I AM SURE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HIM
1696-142314-0072 WELL I'M A BACHELOR AND HAVE STEERED CLEAR OF LOVE AFFAIRS ALL MY LIFE SO PERHAPS MY OPINION IS NOT WORTH HAVING OR ELSE I SHOULD SAY THERE WERE VERY PRETTY SYMPTOMS ABOUT HER THEN I AM SURE YOU ARE WRONG SAID MISTER HALE HE MAY CARE FOR HER
1696-142314-0073 I'M SURE SUCH A THING HAS NEVER ENTERED HER HEAD ENTERING HER HEART WOULD DO BUT I MERELY THREW OUT A SUGGESTION OF WHAT MIGHT BE I DARE SAY I WAS WRONG AND WHETHER I WAS WRONG OR RIGHT I'M VERY SLEEPY
1696-142314-0074 SO HAVING DISTURBED YOUR NIGHT'S REST AS I CAN SEE WITH MY UNTIMELY FANCIES I'LL BETAKE MYSELF WITH AN EASY MIND TO MY OWN BUT MISTER HALE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD NOT BE DISTURBED BY ANY SUCH NONSENSICAL IDEA SO HE LAY AWAKE DETERMINING NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT
1696-142314-0075 MISTER BELL TOOK HIS LEAVE THE NEXT DAY BIDDING MARGARET LOOK TO HIM AS ONE WHO HAD A RIGHT TO HELP AND PROTECT HER IN ALL HER TROUBLES OF WHATEVER NATURE THEY MIGHT BE TO MISTER HALE HE SAID THAT MARGARET OF YOURS HAS GONE DEEP INTO MY HEART
1696-142314-0076 TAKE CARE OF HER FOR SHE IS A VERY PRECIOUS CREATURE A GREAT DEAL TOO GOOD FOR MILTON ONLY FIT FOR OXFORD IN FACT THE TOWN I MEAN NOT THE MEN I CAN'T MATCH HER YET WHEN I CAN
1696-142314-0077 I SHALL BRING MY YOUNG MAN TO STAND SIDE BY SIDE WITH YOUR YOUNG WOMAN JUST AS THE GENIE IN THE ARABIAN NIGHTS BROUGHT PRINCE CARALMAZAN TO MATCH WITH THE FAIRY'S PRINCESS BADOURA I BEG YOU'LL DO NO SUCH THING REMEMBER THE MISFORTUNES THAT ENSUED AND BESIDES
1696-142314-0078 I CAN'T SPARE MARGARET NO ON SECOND THOUGHTS WE'LL HAVE HER TO NURSE US TEN YEARS HENCE WHEN WE SHALL BE TWO CROSS OLD INVALIDS SERIOUSLY HALE I WISH YOU'D LEAVE MILTON WHICH IS A MOST UNSUITABLE PLACE FOR YOU
1696-142314-0079 THOUGH IT WAS MY RECOMMENDATION IN THE FIRST INSTANCE IF YOU WOULD I'D SWALLOW MY SHADOWS OF DOUBTS AND TAKE A COLLEGE LIVING AND YOU AND MARGARET SHOULD COME AND LIVE AT THE PARSONAGE YOU TO BE A SORT OF LAY CURATE AND TAKE THE UNWASHED OFF MY HANDS
1696-142314-0080 AND SHE TO BE OUR HOUSEKEEPER THE VILLAGE LADY BOUNTIFUL BY DAY AND READ US TO SLEEP IN THE EVENINGS I COULD BE VERY HAPPY IN SUCH A LIFE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT NEVER SAID MISTER HALE DECIDEDLY
1696-142314-0081 HERE I STAY OUT MY LIFE AND HERE WILL I BE BURIED AND LOST IN THE CROWD I DON'T GIVE UP MY PLAN YET ONLY I WON'T BAIT YOU WITH IT ANY MORE JUST NOW WHERE'S THE PEARL COME MARGARET GIVE ME A FAREWELL KISS AND REMEMBER MY DEAR
1696-142314-0082 WHERE YOU MAY FIND A TRUE FRIEND AS FAR AS HIS CAPABILITY GOES YOU ARE MY CHILD MARGARET REMEMBER THAT AND GOD BLESS YOU SO THEY FELL BACK INTO THE MONOTONY OF THE QUIET LIFE THEY WOULD HENCEFORTH LEAD THERE WAS NO INVALID TO HOPE AND FEAR ABOUT
1696-142314-0083 EVEN THE HIGGINSES SO LONG A VIVID INTEREST SEEMED TO HAVE RECEDED FROM ANY NEED OF IMMEDIATE THOUGHT THE BOUCHER CHILDREN LEFT MOTHERLESS ORPHANS CLAIMED WHAT OF MARGARET'S CARE SHE COULD BESTOW AND SHE WENT PRETTY OFTEN TO SEE MARY HIGGINS WHO HAD CHARGE OF THEM
1696-142314-0084 BY THE KIND NEIGHBOUR WHOSE GOOD SENSE HAD STRUCK MARGARET AT THE TIME OF BOUCHER'S DEATH OF COURSE SHE WAS PAID FOR HER TROUBLE AND INDEED IN ALL HIS LITTLE PLANS AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR THESE ORPHAN CHILDREN NICHOLAS SHOWED A SOBER JUDGMENT
1696-142314-0085 AND REGULATED METHOD OF THINKING WHICH WERE AT VARIANCE WITH HIS FORMER MORE ECCENTRIC JERKS OF ACTION HE WAS SO STEADY AT HIS WORK THAT MARGARET DID NOT OFTEN SEE HIM DURING THESE WINTER MONTHS BUT WHEN SHE DID
1696-142314-0086 SHE SAW THAT HE WINCED AWAY FROM ANY REFERENCE TO THE FATHER OF THOSE CHILDREN WHOM HE HAD SO FULLY AND HEARTILY TAKEN UNDER HIS CARE HE DID NOT SPEAK EASILY OF MISTER THORNTON TO TELL THE TRUTH SAID HE HE FAIRLY BAMBOOZLES ME
1696-142314-0087 HOW THEM TWO CHAPS IS BOUND UP IN ONE BODY IS A CRADDY FOR ME TO FIND OUT I'LL NOT BE BEAT BY IT THOUGH MEANWHILE HE COMES HERE PRETTY OFTEN
1696-142314-0088 AND I RECKON HE'S TAKEN ABACK BY ME PRETTY MUCH AS I AM BY HIM FOR HE SITS AND LISTENS AND STARES AS IF I WERE SOME STRANGE BEAST NEWLY CAUGHT IN SOME OF THE ZONES BUT I'M NONE DAUNTED
1696-142314-0089 AND DOES HE NOT ANSWER YOU ASKED MISTER HALE
1696-142314-0090 FOR ALL I TAKE CREDIT FOR IMPROVING HIM ABOVE A BIT SOMETIMES HE SAYS A ROUGH THING OR TWO WHICH IS NOT AGREEABLE TO LOOK AT AT FIRST BUT HAS A QUEER SMACK O TRUTH IN IT WHEN YO COME TO CHEW IT
1696-142314-0091 WHAT ARE THEY' BEGAN MISTER HALE BUT MARGARET TOUCHING HIS ARM SHOWED HIM HER WATCH IT IS NEARLY SEVEN SHE SAID THE EVENINGS ARE GETTING LONGER NOW COME PAPA SHE DID NOT BREATHE FREELY
1696-142314-0092 TILL THEY WERE SOME DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE THEN AS SHE BECAME MORE CALM SHE WISHED THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN IN SO GREAT A HURRY FOR SOMEHOW THEY SAW MISTER THORNTON BUT VERY SELDOM NOW AND HE MIGHT HAVE COME TO SEE HIGGINS
1696-142314-0093 YES HE CAME VERY SELDOM EVEN FOR THE DULL COLD PURPOSE OF LESSONS MISTER HALE WAS DISAPPOINTED IN HIS PUPIL'S LUKEWARMNESS ABOUT GREEK LITERATURE
1696-142314-0094 THAT A HURRIED NOTE FROM MISTER THORNTON WOULD ARRIVE
1696-142314-0095 SAYING THAT HE WAS SO MUCH ENGAGED THAT HE COULD NOT COME TO READ WITH MISTER HALE THAT EVENING
1696-142314-0096 NO ONE WAS LIKE HIS FIRST SCHOLAR IN MISTER HALE'S HEART HE WAS DEPRESSED AND SAD AT THIS PARTIAL CESSATION OF AN INTERCOURSE WHICH HAD BECOME DEAR TO HIM AND HE USED TO SIT PONDERING OVER THE REASON THAT COULD HAVE OCCASIONED THIS CHANGE
1696-142314-0097 HE STARTLED MARGARET ONE EVENING AS SHE SATE AT HER WORK BY SUDDENLY ASKING MARGARET
1696-142314-0098 HE ALMOST BLUSHED AS HE PUT THIS QUESTION BUT MISTER BELL'S SCOUTED IDEA RECURRED TO HIM
1696-142314-0099 MARGARET DID NOT ANSWER IMMEDIATELY BUT BY THE BENT DROOPING OF HER HEAD HE GUESSED WHAT HER REPLY WOULD BE YES I BELIEVE OH PAPA I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
1696-142314-0100 AND SHE DROPPED HER WORK AND HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS NO DEAR
1696-142314-0101 DID HE SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT IT NO ANSWER AT FIRST BUT BY AND BY A LITTLE GENTLE RELUCTANT YES AND YOU REFUSED HIM A LONG SIGH
1696-142314-0102 A MORE HELPLESS NERVELESS ATTITUDE AND ANOTHER YES BUT BEFORE HER FATHER COULD SPEAK MARGARET LIFTED UP HER FACE ROSY WITH SOME BEAUTIFUL SHAME AND FIXING HER EYES UPON HIM SAID
1696-142314-0103 NOW PAPA I HAVE TOLD YOU THIS AND I CANNOT TELL YOU MORE AND THEN THE WHOLE THING IS SO PAINFUL TO ME EVERY WORD AND ACTION CONNECTED WITH IT IS SO UNSPEAKABLY BITTER THAT I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK OF IT
1696-142314-0104 OH PAPA I AM SORRY TO HAVE LOST YOU THIS FRIEND BUT I COULD NOT HELP IT BUT OH I AM VERY SORRY SHE SATE DOWN ON THE GROUND AND LAID HER HEAD ON HIS KNEES I TOO AM SORRY MY DEAR
1696-142314-0105 SOME IDEA OF THE KIND MISTER BELL OH DID MISTER BELL SEE IT A LITTLE BUT HE TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD THAT YOU HOW SHALL I SAY IT THAT YOU WERE NOT UNGRACIOUSLY DISPOSED TOWARDS MISTER THORNTON
1696-142314-0106 I KNEW THAT COULD NEVER BE I HOPED THE WHOLE THING WAS BUT AN IMAGINATION BUT I KNEW TOO WELL WHAT YOUR REAL FEELINGS WERE TO SUPPOSE THAT YOU COULD EVER LIKE MISTER THORNTON IN THAT WAY BUT I AM VERY SORRY THEY WERE VERY QUIET AND STILL FOR SOME MINUTES
1696-142314-0107 BUT ON STROKING HER CHEEK IN A CARESSING WAY SOON AFTER HE WAS ALMOST SHOCKED TO FIND HER FACE WET WITH TEARS AS HE TOUCHED HER SHE SPRANG UP AND SMILING WITH FORCED BRIGHTNESS BEGAN TO TALK OF THE LENNOXES WITH SUCH A VEHEMENT DESIRE TO TURN THE CONVERSATION
1696-142314-0108 OH HOW STRANGE IT WILL BE I WONDER WHAT ROOM THEY WILL MAKE INTO THE NURSERY AUNT SHAW WILL BE HAPPY WITH THE BABY FANCY EDITH A MAMMA AND CAPTAIN LENNOX I WONDER WHAT HE WILL DO WITH HIMSELF NOW HE HAS SOLD OUT
1696-142314-0109 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT SAID HER FATHER ANXIOUS TO INDULGE HER IN THIS FRESH SUBJECT OF INTEREST I THINK I MUST SPARE YOU FOR A FORTNIGHT JUST TO RUN UP TO TOWN AND SEE THE TRAVELLERS
1696-142314-0110 YOU COULD LEARN MORE BY HALF AN HOUR'S CONVERSATION WITH MISTER HENRY LENNOX ABOUT FREDERICK'S CHANCES THAN IN A DOZEN OF THESE LETTERS OF HIS
1696-142314-0111 AND WHAT'S MORE I WON'T BE SPARED THEN AFTER A PAUSE SHE ADDED I AM LOSING HOPE SADLY ABOUT FREDERICK HE IS LETTING US DOWN GENTLY BUT I CAN SEE THAT MISTER LENNOX HIMSELF HAS NO HOPE OF HUNTING UP THE WITNESSES UNDER YEARS AND YEARS OF TIME
1696-142314-0112 NO SAID SHE THAT BUBBLE WAS VERY PRETTY AND VERY DEAR TO OUR HEARTS BUT IT HAS BURST LIKE MANY ANOTHER
1696-142314-0113 AND WITH BEING A GREAT DEAL TO EACH OTHER SO DON'T OFFEND ME BY TALKING OF BEING ABLE TO SPARE ME PAPA FOR I ASSURE YOU YOU CAN'T BUT THE IDEA OF A CHANGE TOOK ROOT AND GERMINATED IN MARGARET'S HEART ALTHOUGH NOT IN THE WAY IN WHICH HER FATHER PROPOSED IT AT FIRST
1696-142314-0114 SHE BEGAN TO CONSIDER HOW DESIRABLE SOMETHING OF THE KIND WOULD BE TO HER FATHER WHOSE SPIRITS ALWAYS FEEBLE NOW BECAME TOO FREQUENTLY DEPRESSED AND WHOSE HEALTH THOUGH HE NEVER COMPLAINED HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY AFFECTED BY HIS WIFE'S ILLNESS AND DEATH
1696-142314-0115 THERE WERE THE REGULAR HOURS OF READING WITH HIS PUPILS BUT THAT ALL GIVING AND NO RECEIVING COULD NO LONGER BE CALLED COMPANION SHIP AS IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN MISTER THORNTON CAME TO STUDY UNDER HIM MARGARET WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE WANT UNDER WHICH HE WAS SUFFERING UNKNOWN TO HIMSELF
1696-142314-0116 AND THE POOR LABOURERS IN THE FIELDS OR LEISURELY TRAMPING HOME AT EVE OR TENDING THEIR CATTLE IN THE FOREST
1696-142314-0117 BUT IN MILTON EVERY ONE WAS TOO BUSY FOR QUIET SPEECH OR ANY RIPENED INTERCOURSE OF THOUGHT WHAT THEY SAID WAS ABOUT BUSINESS VERY PRESENT AND ACTUAL AND WHEN THE TENSION OF MIND RELATING TO THEIR DAILY AFFAIRS WAS OVER THEY SUNK INTO FALLOW REST UNTIL NEXT MORNING
1696-142314-0118 THE WORKMAN WAS NOT TO BE FOUND AFTER THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE HE HAD GONE AWAY TO SOME LECTURE OR SOME CLUB OR SOME BEER SHOP ACCORDING TO HIS DEGREE OF CHARACTER MISTER HALE THOUGHT OF TRYING TO DELIVER A COURSE OF LECTURES AT SOME OF THE INSTITUTIONS
