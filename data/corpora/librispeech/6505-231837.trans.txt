6505-231837-0000 CHAPTER FIVE THE TALK OF THE TOWN NOWADAYS EVENTS POLITICAL SOCIAL AND CRIMINAL CROWD SO CLOSELY ON ONE ANOTHER'S HEELS THAT WHAT WAS FORMERLY A NINE DAYS WONDER IS SCARCELY MARVELLED AT THE SAME NUMBER OF MINUTES
6505-231837-0001 AND PROVOKE AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF DISCUSSION AND SURMISE IN THIS CATEGORY MAY BE PLACED THE CRIME COMMITTED IN GENEVA SQUARE FOR WHEN THE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE BECAME KNOWN MUCH CURIOSITY WAS MANIFESTED REGARDING THE POSSIBLE CRIMINAL
6505-231837-0002 THEY HAD FIRST TO DISCOVER THE NAME OF THE DEAD MAN SECOND TO LEARN WHO IT WAS HAD SO FOULLY MURDERED HIM AND THIRD TO FIND OUT THE REASON WHY THE UNKNOWN ASSASSIN SHOULD HAVE SLAIN AN APPARENTLY HARMLESS MAN BUT THESE HIDDEN THINGS WERE NOT EASILY BROUGHT TO LIGHT
6505-231837-0003 AT ALL EVENTS UNTIL AFTER THE INQUEST WHEN THE JURY BROUGHT IN A VERDICT THAT THE DECEASED HAD BEEN VIOLENTLY DONE TO DEATH BY SOME PERSON OR PERSONS UNKNOWN THE TWELVE GOOD MEN AND TRUE STATED THE FULL EXTENT OF KNOWLEDGE GAINED BY JUSTICE IN HER FUTILE SCRAMBLE AFTER CLUES
6505-231837-0004 BERWIN SO CALLED WAS DEAD HIS ASSASSIN HAD MELTED INTO THIN AIR AND THE SILENT HOUSE HAD ADDED A SECOND LEGEND TO ITS ALREADY UNCANNY REPUTATION FORMERLY IT HAD BEEN SIMPLY HAUNTED
6505-231837-0005 AS THE SEX OF THE ASSASSIN FOR OBVIOUS REASONS COULD NOT BE DECIDED MISSUS KEBBY SWORE THAT SHE HAD LEFT THE DECEASED SITTING OVER THE FIRE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON CHRISTMAS EVE
6505-231837-0006 THOUGH FAR FROM ENJOYING THE BEST OF HEALTH WHEN SHE RETURNED SHORTLY AFTER NINE ON CHRISTMAS MORNING THE MAN WAS DEAD AND COLD MEDICAL AID WAS CALLED IN AT THE SAME TIME AS THE POLICE WERE SUMMONED
6505-231837-0007 AND THE EVIDENCE OF THE DOCTOR WHO EXAMINED THE BODY WENT TO PROVE THAT BERWIN HAD BEEN DEAD AT LEAST TEN HOURS THEREFORE HE MUST HAVE BEEN ASSASSINATED BETWEEN THE HOURS OF ELEVEN AND TWELVE OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT SEARCH WAS IMMEDIATELY MADE FOR THE MURDERER
6505-231837-0008 IF IT WAS A MAN WHO HAD DONE THE DEED COULD HAVE ESCAPED BLINDERS THE POLICEMAN ON DUTY AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE SQUARE GAVE EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD BEEN ON DUTY THERE ALL NIGHT AND THAT ALTHOUGH MANY SERVANTS AND OWNERS OF HOUSES BELONGING TO THE SQUARE HAD PASSED IN FROM THEIR CHRISTMAS MARKETINGS
6505-231837-0009 YET NO STRANGER HAD ENTERED THE POLICEMAN KNEW EVERY ONE EVEN TO THE ERRAND BOYS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHO BROUGHT PARCELS OF CHRISTMAS GOODS AND IN MANY CASES HAD EXCHANGED GREETINGS WITH THE PASSERS BY
6505-231837-0010 BUT HE WAS PREPARED TO SWEAR AND IN FACT DID SWEAR AT THE INQUEST THAT NO STRANGER EITHER CAME INTO OR WENT OUT OF GENEVA SQUARE
6505-231837-0011 ONLY TO FIND THAT ALL WAS SAFE BLINDERS DECLARED ON OATH THAT HE HAD NOT ON CHRISTMAS EVE THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF THE HORRID TRAGEDY WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE SILENT HOUSE DURING THE TIME HE WAS ON DUTY
6505-231837-0012 WHEN THE POLICE TOOK POSSESSION OF THE BODY AND MANSION SEARCH WAS MADE IN BEDROOM AND SITTING ROOM FOR PAPERS LIKELY TO THROW LIGHT ON THE IDENTITY OF THE VICTIM BUT IN VAIN NO LETTERS OR TELEGRAMS OR EVEN WRITING OF ANY KIND COULD BE DISCOVERED
6505-231837-0013 THERE WAS NO NAME IN THE DEAD MAN'S BOOKS NO MARK ON HIS CLOTHES NO INITIALS ON HIS LINEN THE LANDLORD OF THE HOUSE DECLARED THAT THE DECEASED HAD HIRED THE MANSION SIX MONTHS BEFORE BUT HAD GIVEN NO REFERENCES
6505-231837-0014 HE HAD NOT INSISTED UPON HAVING THEM THE DECEASED SAID THE LANDLORD HAD PAID A MONTH'S RENT IN ADVANCE IN READY MONEY
6505-231837-0015 THEY COULD NOT FIND OUT THE NAME OF THE VICTIM AND THEREFORE WERE UNABLE TO LEARN HIS PAST LIFE OR TRACE THEREBY IF HE HAD AN ENEMY LIKELY TO HARM HIM BEYOND THE REPORT GIVEN BY LUCIAN OF HIS CONVERSATION WITH THE MAN
6505-231837-0016 WHICH SHOWED THAT BERWIN CERTAINLY HAD SOME ENEMY WHOM HE DREADED THERE WAS NOTHING DISCOVERED TO SHOW REASON FOR THE COMMITTAL OF THE CRIME BERWIN SO CALLED WAS DEAD HE WAS BURIED UNDER HIS ASSUMED NAME AND THERE SO FAR AS THE OBTAINABLE EVIDENCE WENT
6505-231837-0017 WAS AN END TO THE STRANGE TENANT OF THE SILENT HOUSE GORDON LINK THE DETECTIVE CHARGED WITH THE CONDUCT OF THE CASE CONFESSED AS MUCH TO DENZIL I DO NOT SEE THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE OF TRACING BERWIN'S PAST
6505-231837-0018 SAID HE TO THE BARRISTER WE ARE AS IGNORANT ABOUT HIM AS WE ARE OF THE NAME OF THE ASSASSIN ARE YOU SURE THERE IS NO CLUE MISTER LINK ABSOLUTELY NONE EVEN THE WEAPON WITH WHICH THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED CANNOT BE FOUND YOU HAVE SEARCHED THE HOUSE
6505-231837-0019 EVERY INCH OF IT AND WITH THE RESULT THAT I HAVE FOUND NOTHING THE SURROUNDINGS OF THE CASE ARE MOST MYSTERIOUS IF WE DO NOT IDENTIFY THE DEAD WE CANNOT HOPE TO TRACE THE MURDERER
6505-231837-0020 YET IN SOME SECRET WAY PEOPLE WERE IN THE HABIT OF ENTERING THE HOUSE AND BERWIN KNEW AS MUCH NOT ONLY THAT BUT HE PROTECTED THEM FROM CURIOSITY BY DENYING THAT THEY EVEN EXISTED I DON'T QUITE FOLLOW YOU MISTER DENZIL
6505-231837-0021 I ALLUDE TO THE SHADOWS ON THE BLIND WHICH I SAW MYSELF A WEEK BEFORE THE MURDER TOOK PLACE THEY WERE THOSE OF A MAN AND A WOMAN
6505-231837-0022 THEREFORE TWO PEOPLE MUST HAVE BEEN IN BERWIN'S SITTING ROOM ON THAT NIGHT
6505-231837-0023 MORE HE ACTUALLY INSISTED THAT I SHOULD SATISFY MYSELF AS TO THE TRUTH OF THIS BY EXAMINING THE HOUSE WHICH YOU DID YES BUT FOUND NOTHING YET
6505-231837-0024 I ASKED HIM REPLIED THE DETECTIVE BUT HE STATED THAT HOUSES NOWADAYS WERE NOT BUILT WITH SECRET PASSAGES WHEN BERWIN DENIED THAT ANYONE WAS IN THE HOUSE WAS HE AFRAID MISTER DENZIL YES HE SEEMED TO BE NERVOUS AND HE TOLD YOU HE HAD ENEMIES
6505-231837-0025 PERHAPS BUT TO MY MIND THERE IS MORE MELODRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE THAN PEOPLE FANCY
6505-231837-0026 YOUR THIRD CONCLUSION BRINGS US ROUND TO THE POINT WHENCE WE STARTED RETORTED LINK HOW AM I TO DISCOVER THE MAN'S PAST BY LEARNING WHO HE IS AND WHAT IS HIS REAL NAME AN EASY TASK SAID THE DETECTIVE SARCASTICALLY
6505-231837-0027 CONSIDERING THE MEAGRE MATERIAL UPON WHICH WE HAVE TO WORK AND HOW IS THE BUSINESS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BY ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT YES I WONDER THE IDEA DID NOT STRIKE YOU BEFORE SEEING HOW OFTEN IT IS USED IN SIMILAR CASES
6505-231837-0028 ADVERTISE A FULL DESCRIPTION OF THE MAN WHO CALLED HIMSELF BERWIN NOTE HIS PHYSICAL PECULIARITIES AND LOOKS AND CIRCULATE SUCH DESCRIPTION BY MEANS OF HANDBILLS AND NEWSPAPERS LINK LOOKED ANGRY AND LAUGHED RATHER CONTEMPTUOUSLY
6505-231837-0029 AS HIS PROFESSIONAL PRIDE WAS TOUCHED BY THE FACT OF BEING ADVISED BY AN INDIVIDUAL NOT OF HIS CALLING I AM NOT SO IGNORANT OF MY BUSINESS AS YOU THINK HE SAID SHARPLY WHAT YOU SUGGEST HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE
6505-231837-0030 THERE ARE HANDBILLS DESCRIBING THE APPEARANCE OF BERWIN IN EVERY POLICE OFFICE IN THE KINGDOM IN THE NEWSPAPERS ALSO
6505-231837-0031 NO IT IS NOT NECESSARY I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU MANY PEOPLE IN PRIVATE LIFE ARE NOT LIKELY TO SEE YOUR HANDBILLS I DON'T PRETEND TO ADVISE MISTER LINK HE ADDED IN SOOTHING TONES BUT WOULD IT NOT BE WISE TO USE THE MEDIUM OF THE DAILY PAPERS
6505-231837-0032 I'LL THINK OF IT SAID LINK TOO JEALOUS OF HIS DIGNITY TO GIVE WAY AT ONCE OH I QUITE RELY ON YOUR DISCRETION SAID DENZIL HASTILY YOU KNOW YOUR OWN BUSINESS BEST BUT IF YOU SUCCEED IN IDENTIFYING BERWIN WILL YOU LET ME KNOW
6505-231837-0033 SATISFIED THAT THE ONLY WAY TO LEARN THE TRUTH HAD BEEN ADOPTED BY THE AUTHORITIES
6505-231837-0034 WITHIN THE WEEK HE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM THE DETECTIVE YOU WERE RIGHT AND I WAS WRONG MISTER DENZIL ADMITTED LINK GENEROUSLY THE NEWSPAPERS WERE OF MORE USE THAN THE HANDBILLS
6505-231837-0035 YESTERDAY I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A LADY WHO IS COMING TO SEE ME TO MORROW AT MY OFFICE SO IF YOU CARE TO BE PRESENT AT THE INTERVIEW YOU HAVE ONLY TO SAY SO
6505-231837-0036 WHO IS THE LADY A MISSUS VRAIN WHO WRITES FROM BATH CAN SHE IDENTIFY THE DEAD MAN SHE THINKS SHE CAN BUT OF COURSE SHE CANNOT BE CERTAIN UNTIL SHE SEES THE BODY GOING BY THE DESCRIPTION HOWEVER ADDED LINK
