8143-278206-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN BAFFLED MISTER DUNBAR WAS SITTING IN A LUXURIOUS EASY CHAIR WITH A NEWSPAPER LYING ACROSS HIS KNEE MISTER BALDERBY HAD RETURNED TO LONDON UPON THE PREVIOUS EVENING
8143-278206-0001 EVERYBODY WHO LOOKED AT HIM SAW THE CHANGE WHICH THE LAST TEN DAYS HAD MADE IN HIS APPEARANCE HE WAS VERY PALE THERE WERE DARK PURPLE RINGS ABOUT HIS EYES THE EYES THEMSELVES WERE UNNATURALLY BRIGHT AND THE MOUTH
8143-278206-0002 THAT TELL TALE FEATURE OVER WHOSE EXPRESSION NO MAN HAS PERFECT CONTROL BETRAYED THAT THE BANKER HAD SUFFERED ARTHUR LOVELL HAD BEEN INDEFATIGABLE IN THE SERVICE OF HIS CLIENT NOT FROM ANY LOVE TOWARDS THE MAN
8143-278206-0003 BUT ALWAYS INFLUENCED MORE OR LESS BY THE REFLECTION THAT HENRY DUNBAR WAS LAURA'S FATHER AND THAT TO SERVE HENRY DUNBAR WAS IN SOME MANNER TO SERVE THE WOMAN HE LOVED
8143-278206-0004 MISTER DUNBAR HAD ONLY BEEN DISCHARGED FROM CUSTODY UPON THE PREVIOUS EVENING AFTER A LONG AND WEARISOME EXAMINATION AND CROSS EXAMINATION OF THE WITNESSES WHO HAD GIVEN EVIDENCE AT THE CORONER'S INQUEST
8143-278206-0005 AND THAT ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY UPON WHICH THE MAGISTRATE HAD ISSUED HIS WARRANT HE HAD SLEPT TILL LATE AND HAD ONLY JUST FINISHED BREAKFAST WHEN THE WAITER ENTERED WITH MARGARET'S MESSAGE A YOUNG PERSON WISHES TO SEE YOU SIR
8143-278206-0006 HE SAID RESPECTFULLY A YOUNG PERSON EXCLAIMED MISTER DUNBAR IMPATIENTLY I CAN'T SEE ANY ONE WHAT SHOULD ANY YOUNG PERSON WANT WITH ME SHE WANTS TO SEE YOU PARTICULARLY SIR SHE SAYS HER NAME IS WILMOT
8143-278206-0007 THE SICKLY PALLOR OF MISTER DUNBAR'S FACE
8143-278206-0008 AND ARTHUR LOVELL LOOKING AT HIS CLIENT AT THIS MOMENT SAW THE CHANGE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD SEEN ANY EVIDENCE OF FEAR EITHER IN THE FACE OR MANNER OF HENRY DUNBAR I WILL NOT SEE HER
8143-278206-0009 EXCLAIMED MISTER DUNBAR
8143-278206-0010 THIS WOMAN IS SOME IMPUDENT IMPOSTOR WHO WANTS TO EXTORT MONEY OUT OF ME
8143-278206-0011 LET HER BE SENT ABOUT HER BUSINESS THE WAITER HESITATED SHE IS A VERY RESPECTABLE LOOKING PERSON SIR HE SAID SHE DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE AN IMPOSTOR PERHAPS NOT ANSWERED MISTER DUNBAR HAUGHTILY
8143-278206-0012 BUT SHE IS AN IMPOSTOR FOR ALL THAT JOSEPH WILMOT HAD NO DAUGHTER TO MY KNOWLEDGE PRAY DO NOT LET ME BE DISTURBED ABOUT THIS BUSINESS I HAVE SUFFERED QUITE ENOUGH ALREADY ON ACCOUNT OF THIS MAN'S DEATH HE SANK BACK IN HIS CHAIR
8143-278206-0013 AND TOOK UP HIS NEWSPAPER AS HE FINISHED SPEAKING HIS FACE WAS COMPLETELY HIDDEN BEHIND THE NEWSPAPER SHALL I GO AND SPEAK TO THIS GIRL ASKED ARTHUR LOVELL ON NO ACCOUNT THE GIRL IS AN IMPOSTOR LET HER BE SENT ABOUT HER BUSINESS
8143-278206-0014 THE WAITER LEFT THE ROOM PARDON ME MISTER DUNBAR SAID THE YOUNG LAWYER BUT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO MAKE A SUGGESTION AS YOUR LEGAL ADVISER IN THIS BUSINESS I WOULD REALLY RECOMMEND YOU TO SEE THIS GIRL WHY
8143-278206-0015 BECAUSE THE PEOPLE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS ARE NOTORIOUS GOSSIPS AND SCANDAL MONGERS IF YOU REFUSE TO SEE THIS PERSON WHO AT ANY RATE CALLS HERSELF JOSEPH WILMOT'S DAUGHTER THEY MAY SAY THEY MAY SAY WHAT ASKED HENRY DUNBAR
8143-278206-0016 THEY MAY SAY THAT IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOME SPECIAL REASON FOR NOT SEEING HER INDEED MISTER LOVELL THEN I AM TO PUT MYSELF OUT OF THE WAY AFTER BEING FAGGED AND HARASSED TO DEATH ALREADY ABOUT THIS BUSINESS
8143-278206-0017 AND AM TO SEE EVERY ADVENTURESS WHO CHOOSES TO TRADE UPON THE NAME OF THE MURDERED MAN IN ORDER TO STOP THE MOUTHS OF THE GOOD PEOPLE OF WINCHESTER I
8143-278206-0018 IF PEOPLE CHOOSE TO THINK THAT HENRY DUNBAR IS THE MURDERER OF HIS OLD SERVANT THEY ARE WELCOME TO THEIR OPINION I SHALL NOT TROUBLE MYSELF TO SET THEM RIGHT THE WAITER RE ENTERED THE ROOM AS MISTER DUNBAR FINISHED SPEAKING
8143-278206-0019 THE YOUNG PERSON SAYS THAT SHE MUST SEE YOU SIR THE MAN SAID SHE SAYS THAT IF YOU REFUSE TO SEE HER
8143-278206-0020 YOU CAN FIND OUT IF SHE IS REALLY RELATED TO THAT UNHAPPY MAN HERE IS MY PURSE YOU CAN LET HER HAVE ANY MONEY YOU THINK PROPER IF SHE IS THE DAUGHTER OF THAT WRETCHED MAN I SHOULD OF COURSE WISH HER TO BE WELL PROVIDED FOR
8143-278206-0021 ALWAYS ON CONDITION THAT SHE DOES NOT INTRUDE HERSELF UPON ME BUT REMEMBER WHATEVER I GIVE IS CONTINGENT UPON HER OWN GOOD CONDUCT AND MUST NOT IN ANY WAY BE TAKEN AS A BRIBE
8143-278206-0022 IF SHE CHOOSES TO THINK AND SPEAK ILL OF ME SHE IS FREE TO DO SO I HAVE NO FEAR OF HER NOR OF ANY ONE ELSE ARTHUR LOVELL TOOK THE MILLIONAIRE'S PURSE AND WENT DOWN STAIRS WITH THE WAITER
8143-278206-0023 NO VIOLENCE IN HER MANNER BUT THERE WAS A STEADY FIXED RESOLUTE LOOK IN HER WHITE FACE THE YOUNG LAWYER FELT THAT THIS GIRL WOULD NOT BE EASILY PUT OFF BY ANY DENIAL OF MISTER DUNBAR
8143-278206-0024 HE USHERED MARGARET INTO A PRIVATE SITTING ROOM LEADING OUT OF THE HALL AND THEN CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM THE DISAPPOINTED WAITER LINGERED UPON THE DOOR MAT BUT THE GEORGE IS A WELL BUILT HOUSE AND THAT WAITER LINGERED IN VAIN
8143-278206-0025 YOU WANT TO SEE MISTER DUNBAR HE SAID
8143-278206-0026 I WILL TELL THAT TO MISTER DUNBAR HIMSELF YOU ARE REALLY THE DAUGHTER OF JOSEPH WILMOT MISTER DUNBAR SEEMS TO DOUBT THE FACT OF HIS HAVING HAD A DAUGHTER PERHAPS SO MISTER DUNBAR MAY HAVE BEEN UNAWARE OF MY EXISTENCE UNTIL THIS MOMENT
8143-278206-0027 I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL LAST NIGHT WHAT HAD HAPPENED SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT HALF STIFLED BY A HYSTERICAL SOB WHICH SHE COULD NOT REPRESS BUT SHE VERY QUICKLY REGAINED HER SELF CONTROL AND CONTINUED SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY
8143-278206-0028 THE HORRIBLE WORD SEEMED TO SUFFOCATE HER BUT SHE STILL WENT BRAVELY ON I SEARCHED A BOX OF MY FATHER'S AND FOUND THIS SHE TOOK FROM HER POCKET THE LETTER DIRECTED TO NORFOLK ISLAND AND HANDED IT TO THE LAWYER
8143-278206-0029 READ IT SHE SAID YOU WILL SEE THEN HOW MY FATHER HAD BEEN WRONGED BY HENRY DUNBAR ARTHUR LOVELL UNFOLDED THE WORN AND FADED LETTER IT HAD BEEN WRITTEN FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS BEFORE BY SAMPSON WILMOT
8143-278206-0030 MARGARET POINTED TO ONE PASSAGE ON THE SECOND PAGE YOUR BITTERNESS AGAINST HENRY DUNBAR IS VERY PAINFUL TO ME MY DEAR JOSEPH YET I CANNOT BUT FEEL THAT YOUR HATRED AGAINST MY EMPLOYER'S SON IS ONLY NATURAL
8143-278206-0031 YOUR LOT IN LIFE MIGHT HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFERENT TRY TO FORGIVE HIM TRY TO FORGET HIM EVEN IF YOU CANNOT FORGIVE DO NOT TALK OF REVENGE
8143-278206-0032 THE REVELATION OF THAT SECRET WHICH YOU HOLD RESPECTING THE FORGED BILLS WOULD BRING DISGRACE NOT ONLY UPON HIM BUT UPON HIS FATHER AND HIS UNCLE THEY ARE BOTH GOOD AND HONOURABLE MEN
8143-278206-0033 AND I THINK THAT SHAME WOULD KILL THEM REMEMBER THIS AND KEEP THE SECRET OF THAT PAINFUL STORY ARTHUR LOVELL'S FACE GREW TERRIBLY GRAVE AS HE READ THESE LINES
8143-278206-0034 HE HAD HEARD THE STORY OF THE FORGERY HINTED AT BUT HE HAD NEVER HEARD ITS DETAILS HE HAD LOOKED UPON IT AS A CRUEL SCANDAL WHICH HAD PERHAPS ARISEN OUT OF SOME TRIFLING ERROR SOME UNPAID DEBT OF HONOUR
8143-278206-0035 SUGGESTED A MOTIVE THE YOUNG LAWYER DROPPED INTO A CHAIR AND SAT FOR SOME MINUTES SILENTLY PORING OVER THE CLERK'S LETTER HE DID NOT LIKE HENRY DUNBAR HIS GENEROUS YOUNG HEART
8143-278206-0036 WHICH HAD YEARNED TOWARDS LAURA'S FATHER HAD SUNK IN HIS BREAST WITH A DULL CHILL FEELING OF DISAPPOINTMENT AT HIS FIRST MEETING WITH THE RICH MAN STILL AFTER CAREFULLY SIFTING THE EVIDENCE OF THE CORONER'S INQUEST
8143-278206-0037 NO THE MURDER COULD SCARCELY HAVE HAPPENED IN THIS WAY THE ASSASSIN HAD BEEN ARMED WITH THE CRUEL ROPE AND HAD CREPT STEALTHILY BEHIND HIS VICTIM IT WAS NOT A COMMON MURDER THE ROPE AND THE SLIP KNOT
8143-278206-0038 THE TREACHEROUS RUNNING NOOSE HINTED DARKLY AT ORIENTAL EXPERIENCES SOMEWHAT IN THIS FASHION MIGHT A MURDEROUS THUG HAVE ASSAILED HIS UNCONSCIOUS VICTIM BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WAS ONE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT ALWAYS REMAINED IN HENRY DUNBAR'S FAVOUR
8143-278206-0039 THAT CIRCUMSTANCE WAS THE ROBBERY OF THE DEAD MAN'S CLOTHES THE ANGLO INDIAN MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE RIFLED THE POCKET BOOK AND LEFT IT EMPTY UPON THE SCENE OF THE MURDER IN ORDER TO THROW THE OFFICERS OF JUSTICE UPON A WRONG SCENT
8143-278206-0040 THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONLY THE WORK OF A FEW MOMENTS BUT WAS IT PROBABLE WAS IT EVEN POSSIBLE THAT THE MURDERER WOULD HAVE LINGERED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT WITH EVERY CHANCE AGAINST HIM LONG ENOUGH TO STRIP OFF THE GARMENTS OF HIS VICTIM
8143-278206-0041 IN ORDER STILL MORE EFFECTUALLY TO HOODWINK SUSPICION WAS IT NOT A GREAT DEAL MORE LIKELY THAT JOSEPH WILMOT HAD SPENT THE AFTERNOON DRINKING IN THE TAP ROOM OF SOME ROADSIDE PUBLIC HOUSE AND HAD RAMBLED BACK INTO THE GROVE AFTER DARK
8143-278206-0042 TO MEET HIS DEATH AT THE HANDS OF SOME EVERY DAY ASSASSIN BENT ONLY UPON PLUNDER ALL THESE THOUGHTS PASSED THROUGH ARTHUR LOVELL'S MIND AS HE SAT WITH SAMPSON'S FADED LETTER IN HIS HANDS
8143-278206-0043 MARGARET WILMOT WATCHED HIM WITH EAGER SCRUTINIZING EYES SHE SAW DOUBT PERPLEXITY HORROR INDECISION ALL STRUGGLING IN HIS HANDSOME FACE BUT THE LAWYER FELT THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO ACT
8143-278206-0044 HE WAS ONLY HORROR STRICKEN BY THE FIRST WHISPER OF DOUBT MISTER DUNBAR DECLINES TO SEE YOU HE SAID TO MARGARET AND I DO NOT REALLY SEE WHAT GOOD COULD POSSIBLY ARISE OUT OF AN INTERVIEW BETWEEN YOU IN THE MEANTIME
8143-278206-0045 IF YOU ARE IN ANY WAY DISTRESSED AND YOU MUST MOST LIKELY NEED ASSISTANCE AT SUCH A TIME AS THIS HE IS QUITE READY TO HELP YOU AND HE IS ALSO READY TO GIVE YOU PERMANENT HELP IF YOU REQUIRE IT HE OPENED HENRY DUNBAR'S PURSE AS HE SPOKE
8143-278206-0046 BUT THE GIRL ROSE AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH ICY DISDAIN IN HER FIXED WHITE FACE I WOULD SOONER CRAWL FROM DOOR TO DOOR BEGGING MY BREAD OF THE HARDEST STRANGERS IN THIS CRUEL WORLD
8143-278206-0047 THAN I WOULD ACCEPT HELP FROM HENRY DUNBAR NO POWER ON EARTH WILL EVER INDUCE ME TO TAKE A SIXPENCE FROM THAT MAN'S HAND WHY NOT YOU KNOW WHY NOT I CAN SEE THAT KNOWLEDGE IN YOUR FACE
8143-278206-0048 TELL MISTER DUNBAR THAT I WILL WAIT AT THE DOOR OF THIS HOUSE TILL HE COMES OUT TO SPEAK TO ME I WILL WAIT UNTIL I DROP DOWN DEAD ARTHUR LOVELL WENT BACK TO HIS CLIENT AND TOLD HIM WHAT THE GIRL SAID
8143-278206-0049 MISTER DUNBAR WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE ROOM WITH HIS HEAD BENT MOODILY UPON HIS BREAST BY HEAVENS HE CRIED ANGRILY I WILL HAVE THIS GIRL REMOVED BY THE POLICE IF HE STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND HIS HEAD SANK ONCE MORE UPON HIS BREAST
8143-278206-0050 I WOULD MOST EARNESTLY ADVISE YOU TO SEE HER PLEADED ARTHUR LOVELL IF SHE GOES AWAY IN HER PRESENT FRAME OF MIND SHE MAY SPREAD A HORRIBLE SCANDAL AGAINST YOU YOUR REFUSING TO SEE HER WILL CONFIRM THE SUSPICIONS WHICH WHAT
8143-278206-0051 CRIED HENRY DUNBAR DOES SHE DARE TO SUSPECT ME I FEAR SO HAS SHE SAID AS MUCH NOT IN ACTUAL WORDS BUT HER MANNER BETRAYED HER SUSPICIONS YOU MUST NOT WONDER IF THIS GIRL IS UNREASONABLE
8143-278206-0052 HER FATHER'S MISERABLE FATE MUST HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE BLOW TO HER DID YOU OFFER HER MONEY I DID AND SHE SHE REFUSED IT MISTER DUNBAR WINCED
8143-278206-0053 AS IF THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE GIRL'S REFUSAL HAD STUNG HIM TO THE QUICK SINCE IT MUST BE SO HE SAID I WILL SEE THIS IMPORTUNATE WOMAN BUT NOT TO DAY TO DAY I MUST AND WILL HAVE REST
8143-278206-0054 TELL HER TO COME TO ME TO MORROW MORNING AT TEN O'CLOCK I WILL SEE HER THEN ARTHUR LOVELL CARRIED THIS MESSAGE TO MARGARET THE GIRL LOOKED AT HIM WITH AN EARNEST QUESTIONING GLANCE YOU ARE NOT DECEIVING ME SHE SAID NO
8143-278206-0055 MISTER DUNBAR SAID THAT HE DID THEN I WILL GO AWAY BUT DO NOT LET HENRY DUNBAR TRY TO DECEIVE ME FOR I WILL FOLLOW HIM TO THE END OF THE WORLD I CARE VERY LITTLE WHERE I GO IN MY SEARCH FOR THE MAN WHO MURDERED MY FATHER
8143-278206-0056 SHE WENT SLOWLY AWAY SHE WENT DOWN INTO THE CATHEDRAL YARD ACROSS WHICH THE MURDERED MAN HAD GONE ARM IN ARM WITH HIS COMPANION SOME BOYS LOITERING ABOUT AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE MEADOWS
8143-278206-0057 IT WAS A DULL MISTY DAY
8143-278206-0058 THE RAIN DROPS FROM THE FADING LEAVES FELL INTO THE STREAMLET FROM WHOSE SHALLOW WATERS THE DEAD MAN'S FACE HAD LOOKED UP TO THE MOONLIT SKY LATER IN THE AFTERNOON MARGARET FOUND HER WAY TO A CEMETERY OUTSIDE THE TOWN
8143-278206-0059 WHERE UNDER A NEWLY MADE MOUND OF TURF THE MURDERED MAN LAY A GREAT MANY PEOPLE HAD BEEN TO SEE THIS GRAVE AND HAD BEEN VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED AT FINDING IT IN NO WAY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER GRAVES
8143-278206-0060 ALREADY THE GOOD CITIZENS OF WINCHESTER HAD BEGUN TO HINT THAT THE GROVE NEAR SAINT CROSS WAS HAUNTED
8143-278206-0061 PUNCTUAL TO THE VERY STRIKING OF THE CLOCK MARGARET WILMOT PRESENTED HERSELF AT THE GEORGE AT THE TIME APPOINTED BY MISTER DUNBAR
8143-278206-0062 IN THOSE TROUBLED DREAMS SHE HAD MET THE RICH MAN PERPETUALLY NOW IN ONE PLACE NOW IN ANOTHER BUT ALWAYS IN THE MOST UNLIKELY PLACES YET SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIS FACE SHE HAD TRIED TO SEE IT
8143-278206-0063 BUT BY SOME STRANGE DEVILRY OR OTHER PECULIAR TO THE INCIDENTS OF A DREAM IT HAD BEEN ALWAYS HIDDEN FROM HER THE SAME WAITER WAS LOUNGING IN THE SAME ATTITUDE AT THE DOOR OF THE HOTEL HE LOOKED UP WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SURPRISE AS MARGARET APPROACHED HIM
8143-278206-0064 YOU'VE NOT GONE THEN MISS HE EXCLAIMED GONE NO I HAVE WAITED TO SEE MISTER DUNBAR WELL THAT'S QUEER SAID THE WAITER DID HE TELL YOU HE'D SEE YOU YES HE PROMISED TO SEE ME AT TEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING THAT'S UNCOMMON QUEER
8143-278206-0065 BECAUSE MISTER DUNBAR AND THAT YOUNG GENT AS WAS WITH HIM
8143-278206-0066 MARGARET WILMOT GAVE NO UTTERANCE TO EITHER SURPRISE OR INDIGNATION SHE WALKED QUIETLY AWAY AND WENT ONCE MORE TO THE HOUSE OF SIR ARDEN WESTHORPE SHE TOLD HIM WHAT HAD OCCURRED AND HER STATEMENT WAS WRITTEN DOWN AND SIGNED AS UPON THE PREVIOUS DAY
8143-278206-0067 MISTER DUNBAR MURDERED MY FATHER SHE SAID AFTER THIS HAD BEEN DONE AND HE'S AFRAID TO SEE ME
