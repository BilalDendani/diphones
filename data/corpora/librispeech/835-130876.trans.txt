835-130876-0000 WITHOUT STANDING UP WE STARED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FOREST MY HAND STOPPING HALFWAY TO MY MOUTH NED LAND'S COMPLETING ITS ASSIGNMENT STONES DON'T FALL FROM THE SKY CONSEIL SAID OR ELSE THEY DESERVE TO BE CALLED METEORITES
835-130876-0001 A SECOND WELL POLISHED STONE REMOVED A TASTY RINGDOVE LEG FROM CONSEIL'S HAND GIVING STILL GREATER RELEVANCE TO HIS OBSERVATION WE ALL THREE STOOD UP RIFLES TO OUR SHOULDERS READY TO ANSWER ANY ATTACK
835-130876-0002 APES MAYBE NED LAND EXCLAIMED NEARLY CONSEIL REPLIED SAVAGES HEAD FOR THE SKIFF I SAID MOVING TOWARD THE SEA INDEED IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO BEAT A RETREAT
835-130876-0003 BECAUSE SOME TWENTY NATIVES ARMED WITH BOWS AND SLINGS APPEARED BARELY A HUNDRED PACES OFF ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF A THICKET THAT MASKED THE HORIZON TO OUR RIGHT THE SKIFF WAS AGROUND TEN FATHOMS AWAY FROM US THE SAVAGES APPROACHED WITHOUT RUNNING
835-130876-0004 BUT THEY FAVORED US WITH A SHOW OF THE GREATEST HOSTILITY IT WAS RAINING STONES AND ARROWS NED LAND WAS UNWILLING TO LEAVE HIS PROVISIONS BEHIND AND DESPITE THE IMPENDING DANGER HE CLUTCHED HIS PIG ON ONE SIDE
835-130876-0005 HIS KANGAROOS ON THE OTHER AND SCAMPERED OFF WITH RESPECTABLE SPEED IN TWO MINUTES WE WERE ON THE STRAND LOADING PROVISIONS AND WEAPONS INTO THE SKIFF PUSHING IT TO SEA AND POSITIONING ITS TWO OARS
835-130876-0006 WERE THE WORK OF AN INSTANT WE HADN'T GONE TWO CABLE LENGTHS WHEN A HUNDRED SAVAGES HOWLING AND GESTICULATING ENTERED THE WATER UP TO THEIR WAISTS I LOOKED TO SEE IF THEIR APPEARANCE MIGHT DRAW SOME OF THE NAUTILUS'S MEN ONTO THE PLATFORM
835-130876-0007 BUT NO LYING WELL OUT THAT ENORMOUS MACHINE STILL SEEMED COMPLETELY DESERTED TWENTY MINUTES LATER WE BOARDED SHIP THE HATCHES WERE OPEN AFTER MOORING THE SKIFF WE REENTERED THE NAUTILUS'S INTERIOR I WENT BELOW TO THE LOUNGE
835-130876-0008 FROM WHICH SOME CHORDS WERE WAFTING CAPTAIN NEMO WAS THERE LEANING OVER THE ORGAN DEEP IN A MUSICAL TRANCE CAPTAIN I SAID TO HIM HE DIDN'T HEAR ME CAPTAIN I WENT ON TOUCHING HIM WITH MY HAND
835-130876-0009 HE TREMBLED AND TURNING AROUND AH IT'S YOU PROFESSOR HE SAID TO ME WELL DID YOU HAVE A HAPPY HUNT WAS YOUR HERB GATHERING A SUCCESS YES CAPTAIN I REPLIED
835-130876-0010 BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE BROUGHT BACK A HORDE OF BIPEDS WHOSE PROXIMITY WORRIES ME WHAT SORT OF BIPEDS SAVAGES SAVAGES CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED IN AN IRONIC TONE
835-130876-0011 YOU SET FOOT ON ONE OF THE SHORES OF THIS GLOBE PROFESSOR AND YOU'RE SURPRISED TO FIND SAVAGES THERE WHERE AREN'T THERE SAVAGES AND BESIDES ARE THEY ANY WORSE THAN MEN ELSEWHERE THESE PEOPLE YOU CALL SAVAGES
835-130876-0012 BUT CAPTAIN SPEAKING FOR MYSELF SIR I'VE ENCOUNTERED THEM EVERYWHERE WELL THEN I REPLIED IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WELCOME THEM ABOARD THE NAUTILUS YOU'D BETTER TAKE SOME PRECAUTIONS EASY PROFESSOR
835-130876-0013 NO CAUSE FOR ALARM BUT THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE NATIVES WHAT'S YOUR COUNT AT LEAST A HUNDRED PROFESSOR ARONNAX
835-130876-0014 THE NAUTILUS WOULD STILL HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM THEIR ATTACKS
835-130876-0015 AND I NOTICED THAT HE TOUCHED ONLY ITS BLACK KEYS WHICH GAVE HIS MELODIES A BASICALLY SCOTTISH COLOR SOON HE HAD FORGOTTEN MY PRESENCE AND WAS LOST IN A REVERIE THAT I NO LONGER TRIED TO DISPEL I CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM
835-130876-0016 NIGHT HAD ALREADY FALLEN BECAUSE IN THIS LOW LATITUDE THE SUN SETS QUICKLY WITHOUT ANY TWILIGHT I COULD SEE GUEBOROA ISLAND ONLY DIMLY BUT NUMEROUS FIRES HAD BEEN KINDLED ON THE BEACH ATTESTING THAT THE NATIVES HAD NO THOUGHTS OF LEAVING IT
835-130876-0017 FOR SEVERAL HOURS I WAS LEFT TO MYSELF SOMETIMES MUSING ON THE ISLANDERS BUT NO LONGER FEARING THEM BECAUSE THE CAPTAIN'S UNFLAPPABLE CONFIDENCE HAD WON ME OVER AND SOMETIMES FORGETTING THEM TO MARVEL AT THE SPLENDORS OF THIS TROPICAL NIGHT
835-130876-0018 MY MEMORIES TOOK WING TOWARD FRANCE IN THE WAKE OF THOSE ZODIACAL STARS DUE TO TWINKLE OVER IT IN A FEW HOURS THE MOON SHONE IN THE MIDST OF THE CONSTELLATIONS AT THEIR ZENITH
835-130876-0019 I THEN REMEMBERED THAT THIS LOYAL GOOD NATURED SATELLITE WOULD RETURN TO THIS SAME PLACE THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW TO RAISE THE TIDE AND TEAR THE NAUTILUS FROM ITS CORAL BED NEAR MIDNIGHT SEEING THAT ALL WAS QUIET OVER THE DARKENED WAVES AS WELL AS UNDER THE WATERSIDE TREES
835-130876-0020 I REPAIRED TO MY CABIN AND FELL INTO A PEACEFUL SLEEP THE NIGHT PASSED WITHOUT MISHAP NO DOUBT THE PAPUANS HAD BEEN FRIGHTENED OFF BY THE MERE SIGHT OF THIS MONSTER AGROUND IN THE BAY
835-130876-0021 BECAUSE OUR HATCHES STAYED OPEN OFFERING EASY ACCESS TO THE NAUTILUS'S INTERIOR AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING JANUARY EIGHTH I CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM THE MORNING SHADOWS WERE LIFTING THE ISLAND WAS SOON ON VIEW
835-130876-0022 THROUGH THE DISSOLVING MISTS FIRST ITS BEACHES THEN ITS SUMMITS THE ISLANDERS WERE STILL THERE IN GREATER NUMBERS THAN ON THE DAY BEFORE PERHAPS FIVE HUNDRED OR SIX HUNDRED OF THEM
835-130876-0023 I COULD EASILY DISTINGUISH THEM
835-130876-0024 ATHLETIC IN BUILD FOREHEAD HIGH AND BROAD NOSE LARGE BUT NOT FLAT TEETH WHITE THEIR WOOLLY RED TINTED HAIR WAS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THEIR BODIES WHICH WERE BLACK AND GLISTENING LIKE THOSE OF NUBIANS
835-130876-0025 GENERALLY THESE SAVAGES WERE NAKED I NOTED SOME WOMEN AMONG THEM DRESSED FROM HIP TO KNEE IN GRASS SKIRTS HELD UP BY BELTS MADE OF VEGETATION
835-130876-0026 ARMED WITH BOWS ARROWS AND SHIELDS NEARLY ALL OF THEM CARRIED FROM THEIR SHOULDERS A SORT OF NET WHICH HELD THOSE POLISHED STONES THEIR SLINGS HURL WITH SUCH DEXTERITY
835-130876-0027 ONE OF THESE CHIEFTAINS CAME FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE NAUTILUS EXAMINING IT WITH CARE
835-130876-0028 BECAUSE HE PARADED IN A MAT OF BANANA LEAVES THAT HAD RAGGED EDGES AND WAS ACCENTED WITH BRIGHT COLORS I COULD EASILY HAVE PICKED OFF THIS ISLANDER HE STOOD AT SUCH CLOSE RANGE BUT I THOUGHT IT BEST TO WAIT FOR AN ACTUAL SHOW OF HOSTILITY
835-130876-0029 BETWEEN EUROPEANS AND SAVAGES IT'S ACCEPTABLE FOR EUROPEANS TO SHOOT BACK BUT NOT TO ATTACK FIRST DURING THIS WHOLE TIME OF LOW TIDE THE ISLANDERS LURKED NEAR THE NAUTILUS BUT THEY WEREN'T BOISTEROUS
835-130876-0030 I OFTEN HEARD THEM REPEAT THE WORD ASSAI AND FROM THEIR GESTURES I UNDERSTOOD THEY WERE INVITING ME TO GO ASHORE AN INVITATION I FELT OBLIGED TO DECLINE SO THE SKIFF DIDN'T LEAVE SHIPSIDE THAT DAY
835-130876-0031 MUCH TO THE DISPLEASURE OF MISTER LAND WHO COULDN'T COMPLETE HIS PROVISIONS THE ADROIT CANADIAN SPENT HIS TIME PREPARING THE MEAT AND FLOUR PRODUCTS HE HAD BROUGHT FROM GUEBOROA ISLAND
835-130876-0032 HAVING NOTHING BETTER TO DO I DECIDED TO DREDGE THESE BEAUTIFUL CLEAR WATERS WHICH EXHIBITED A PROFUSION OF SHELLS ZOOPHYTES AND OPEN SEA PLANTS BESIDES IT WAS THE LAST DAY THE NAUTILUS WOULD SPEND IN THESE WATERWAYS
835-130876-0033 IF TOMORROW IT STILL FLOATED OFF TO THE OPEN SEA AS CAPTAIN NEMO HAD PROMISED SO I SUMMONED CONSEIL WHO BROUGHT ME A SMALL LIGHT DRAGNET SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN OYSTER FISHING WHAT ABOUT THESE SAVAGES CONSEIL ASKED ME
835-130876-0034 THEY DON'T STRIKE ME AS VERY WICKED THEY'RE CANNIBALS EVEN SO MY BOY A PERSON CAN BE BOTH A CANNIBAL AND A DECENT MAN CONSEIL REPLIED JUST AS A PERSON CAN BE BOTH GLUTTONOUS AND HONORABLE THE ONE DOESN'T EXCLUDE THE OTHER
835-130876-0035 FINE CONSEIL AND I AGREE THAT THERE ARE HONORABLE CANNIBALS WHO DECENTLY DEVOUR THEIR PRISONERS HOWEVER
835-130876-0036 I'M OPPOSED TO BEING DEVOURED EVEN IN ALL DECENCY SO I'LL KEEP ON MY GUARD ESPECIALLY SINCE THE NAUTILUS'S COMMANDER SEEMS TO BE TAKING NO PRECAUTIONS AND NOW LET'S GET TO WORK
835-130876-0037 FOR TWO HOURS OUR FISHING PROCEEDED ENERGETICALLY BUT WITHOUT BRINGING UP ANY RARITIES OUR DRAGNET WAS FILLED WITH MIDAS ABALONE
835-130876-0038 I HAD SEEN TO THAT DAY WE ALSO GATHERED IN A FEW SEA CUCUMBERS SOME PEARL OYSTERS AND A DOZEN SMALL TURTLES THAT WE SAVED FOR THE SHIP'S PANTRY BUT JUST WHEN I LEAST EXPECTED IT I LAID MY HANDS ON A WONDER A NATURAL DEFORMITY I'D HAVE TO CALL IT
835-130876-0039 SOMETHING VERY SELDOM ENCOUNTERED CONSEIL HAD JUST MADE A CAST OF THE DRAGNET AND HIS GEAR HAD COME BACK UP LOADED WITH A VARIETY OF FAIRLY ORDINARY SEASHELLS WHEN SUDDENLY HE SAW ME PLUNGE MY ARMS SWIFTLY INTO THE NET
835-130876-0040 PULL OUT A SHELLED ANIMAL AND GIVE A CONCHOLOGICAL YELL IN OTHER WORDS THE MOST PIERCING YELL A HUMAN THROAT CAN PRODUCE
835-130876-0041 DID MASTER GET BITTEN NO MY BOY BUT I'D GLADLY HAVE SACRIFICED A FINGER FOR SUCH A FIND WHAT FIND THIS SHELL I SAID DISPLAYING THE SUBJECT OF MY TRIUMPH BUT THAT'S SIMPLY AN OLIVE SHELL OF THE TENT OLIVE SPECIES
835-130876-0042 BRANCH MOLLUSCA YES YES CONSEIL BUT INSTEAD OF COILING FROM RIGHT TO LEFT THIS OLIVE SHELL ROLLS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IT CAN'T BE CONSEIL EXCLAIMED YES MY BOY IT'S A LEFT HANDED SHELL
835-130876-0043 A LEFT HANDED SHELL CONSEIL REPEATED HIS HEART POUNDING LOOK AT ITS SPIRAL
835-130876-0044 BUT NEVER HAVE I FELT SUCH EXCITEMENT AND THERE WAS GOOD REASON TO BE EXCITED IN FACT AS NATURALISTS HAVE VENTURED TO OBSERVE DEXTRALITY IS A WELL KNOWN LAW OF NATURE IN THEIR ROTATIONAL AND ORBITAL MOVEMENTS
835-130876-0045 A SHELL ISN'T WORTH A HUMAN LIFE I TOLD HIM OH THE RASCAL CONSEIL EXCLAIMED I'D RATHER HE CRACKED MY SHOULDER CONSEIL WAS IN DEAD EARNEST BUT
835-130876-0046 I DIDN'T SUBSCRIBE TO HIS VIEWS HOWEVER THE SITUATION HAD CHANGED IN ONLY A SHORT TIME AND WE HADN'T NOTICED NOW SOME TWENTY DUGOUT CANOES WERE SURROUNDING THE NAUTILUS
835-130876-0047 HOLLOWED FROM TREE TRUNKS THESE DUGOUTS WERE LONG NARROW AND WELL DESIGNED FOR SPEED KEEPING THEIR BALANCE BY MEANS OF TWO BAMBOO POLES THAT FLOATED ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER THEY WERE MANEUVERED BY SKILLFUL HALF NAKED PADDLERS AND I VIEWED THEIR ADVANCE WITH DEFINITE ALARM
835-130876-0048 IT WAS OBVIOUS THESE PAPUANS HAD ALREADY ENTERED INTO RELATIONS WITH EUROPEANS AND KNEW THEIR SHIPS BUT THIS LONG IRON CYLINDER LYING IN THE BAY WITH NO MASTS OR FUNNELS WHAT WERE THEY TO MAKE OF IT
835-130876-0049 NOW THEN IT WAS PRECISELY THIS FAMILIARITY THAT WE NEEDED TO PREVENT SINCE OUR WEAPONS MADE NO SOUND WHEN THEY WENT OFF THEY WOULD HAVE ONLY A MODERATE EFFECT ON THESE ISLANDERS WHO REPUTEDLY RESPECT
835-130876-0050 NOTHING BUT NOISY MECHANISMS WITHOUT THUNDERCLAPS LIGHTNING BOLTS WOULD BE MUCH LESS FRIGHTENING ALTHOUGH THE DANGER LIES IN THE FLASH NOT THE NOISE JUST THEN THE DUGOUT CANOES DREW NEARER TO THE NAUTILUS AND A CLOUD OF ARROWS BURST OVER US
835-130876-0051 FIRE AND BRIMSTONE IT'S HAILING CONSEIL SAID AND POISONED HAIL PERHAPS WE'VE GOT TO ALERT CAPTAIN NEMO I SAID REENTERING THE HATCH I WENT BELOW TO THE LOUNGE I FOUND NO ONE THERE I VENTURED A KNOCK
835-130876-0052 AT THE DOOR OPENING INTO THE CAPTAIN'S STATEROOM THE WORD ENTER ANSWERED ME I DID SO AND FOUND CAPTAIN NEMO BUSY WITH CALCULATIONS IN WHICH THERE WAS NO SHORTAGE OF X AND OTHER ALGEBRAIC SIGNS AM I DISTURBING YOU
835-130876-0053 I SAID OUT OF POLITENESS CORRECT PROFESSOR ARONNAX THE CAPTAIN ANSWERED ME BUT I IMAGINE YOU HAVE PRESSING REASONS FOR LOOKING ME UP VERY PRESSING NATIVE DUGOUT CANOES ARE SURROUNDING US AND IN A FEW MINUTES WE'RE
835-130876-0054 SURE TO BE ASSAULTED BY SEVERAL HUNDRED SAVAGES AH CAPTAIN NEMO PUT IN SERENELY THEY'VE COME IN THEIR DUGOUTS YES SIR WELL SIR CLOSING THE HATCHES SHOULD DO THE TRICK PRECISELY AND THAT'S WHAT I CAME TO TELL YOU
835-130876-0055 NOTHING EASIER CAPTAIN NEMO SAID AND HE PRESSED AN ELECTRIC BUTTON TRANSMITTING AN ORDER TO THE CREW'S QUARTERS THERE SIR ALL UNDER CONTROL HE TOLD ME AFTER A FEW MOMENTS THE SKIFF IS IN PLACE AND THE HATCHES ARE CLOSED
835-130876-0056 NO CAPTAIN BUT ONE DANGER STILL REMAINS WHAT'S THAT SIR TOMORROW AT ABOUT THIS TIME WE'LL NEED TO REOPEN THE HATCHES TO RENEW THE NAUTILUS'S AIR NO ARGUMENT SIR SINCE OUR CRAFT BREATHES IN THE MANNER FAVORED BY CETACEANS
835-130876-0057 BUT IF THESE PAPUANS ARE OCCUPYING THE PLATFORM AT THAT MOMENT I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN PREVENT THEM FROM ENTERING THEN SIR YOU ASSUME THEY'LL BOARD THE SHIP I'M CERTAIN OF IT WELL SIR LET THEM COME ABOARD
835-130876-0058 I SEE NO REASON TO PREVENT THEM DEEP DOWN THEY'RE JUST POOR DEVILS THESE PAPUANS
835-130876-0059 ON THIS NOTE I WAS ABOUT TO WITHDRAW BUT CAPTAIN NEMO DETAINED ME AND INVITED ME TO TAKE A SEAT NEXT TO HIM HE QUESTIONED ME WITH INTEREST ON OUR EXCURSIONS ASHORE AND ON OUR HUNTING BUT SEEMED NOT TO UNDERSTAND THE CANADIAN'S PASSIONATE CRAVING FOR RED MEAT
835-130876-0060 THEN OUR CONVERSATION SKIMMED VARIOUS SUBJECTS AND WITHOUT BEING MORE FORTHCOMING CAPTAIN NEMO PROVED MORE AFFABLE AMONG OTHER THINGS WE CAME TO TALK OF THE NAUTILUS'S CIRCUMSTANCES AGROUND IN THE SAME STRAIT WHERE CAPTAIN DUMONT D'URVILLE
835-130876-0061 HAD NEARLY MISCARRIED THEN PERTINENT TO THIS HE WAS ONE OF YOUR GREAT SEAMEN THE CAPTAIN TOLD ME ONE OF YOUR SHREWDEST NAVIGATORS THAT D'URVILLE HE WAS THE FRENCHMAN'S CAPTAIN COOK A MAN WISE BUT UNLUCKY
835-130876-0062 ONLY TO PERISH WRETCHEDLY IN A TRAIN WRECK IF THAT ENERGETIC MAN WAS ABLE TO THINK ABOUT HIS LIFE IN ITS LAST SECONDS IMAGINE WHAT HIS FINAL THOUGHTS MUST HAVE BEEN AS HE SPOKE CAPTAIN NEMO SEEMED DEEPLY MOVED AN EMOTION I FELT WAS TO HIS CREDIT
835-130876-0063 THEN CHART IN HAND WE RETURNED TO THE DEEDS OF THE FRENCH NAVIGATOR HIS VOYAGES TO CIRCUMNAVIGATE THE GLOBE HIS DOUBLE ATTEMPT AT THE SOUTH POLE WHICH LED TO HIS DISCOVERY OF THE
835-130876-0064 FINALLY HIS HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS OF THE CHIEF ISLANDS IN OCEANIA WHAT YOUR D'URVILLE DID ON THE SURFACE OF THE SEA CAPTAIN NEMO TOLD ME I'VE DONE IN THE OCEAN'S INTERIOR BUT MORE EASILY MORE COMPLETELY THAN HE
835-130876-0065 A QUIET WORK ROOM TRULY AT REST IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS EVEN SO CAPTAIN I SAID THERE IS ONE MAJOR SIMILARITY BETWEEN DUMONT D'URVILLE'S SLOOPS OF WAR AND THE NAUTILUS WHAT'S THAT SIR
835-130876-0066 LIKE THEM THE NAUTILUS HAS RUN AGROUND THE NAUTILUS IS NOT AGROUND SIR CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED ICILY THE NAUTILUS WAS BUILT TO REST ON THE OCEAN FLOOR AND I DON'T NEED TO UNDERTAKE THE ARDUOUS LABORS THE MANEUVERS D'URVILLE HAD TO ATTEMPT IN ORDER TO FLOAT OFF
835-130876-0067 HIS SLOOPS OF WAR THE ZEALOUS AND THE NEW ASTROLABE WELLNIGH PERISHED BUT MY NAUTILUS IS IN NO DANGER TOMORROW ON THE DAY STATED AND AT THE HOUR STATED THE TIDE WILL PEACEFULLY LIFT IT OFF AND IT WILL RESUME ITS NAVIGATING THROUGH THE SEAS
835-130876-0068 CAPTAIN I SAID I DON'T DOUBT TOMORROW CAPTAIN NEMO ADDED STANDING UP TOMORROW AT TWO FORTY IN THE AFTERNOON THE NAUTILUS WILL FLOAT OFF AND EXIT THE TORRES STRAIT UNDAMAGED
835-130876-0069 PRONOUNCING THESE WORDS IN AN EXTREMELY SHARP TONE CAPTAIN NEMO GAVE ME A CURT BOW THIS WAS MY DISMISSAL AND I REENTERED MY STATEROOM THERE I FOUND CONSEIL WHO WANTED TO KNOW THE UPSHOT OF MY INTERVIEW WITH THE CAPTAIN MY BOY I REPLIED
835-130876-0070 SO I'VE JUST ONE THING TO SAY TO YOU HAVE FAITH IN HIM AND SLEEP IN PEACE MASTER HAS NO NEED FOR MY SERVICES NO MY FRIEND WHAT'S NED LAND UP TO BEGGING MASTER'S INDULGENCE CONSEIL REPLIED
835-130876-0071 BUT OUR FRIEND NED IS CONCOCTING A KANGAROO PIE THAT WILL BE THE EIGHTH WONDER I WAS LEFT TO MYSELF I WENT TO BED BUT SLEPT PRETTY POORLY I KEPT HEARING NOISES FROM THE SAVAGES WHO WERE STAMPING ON THE PLATFORM AND LETTING OUT DEAFENING YELLS
835-130876-0072 THE NIGHT PASSED IN THIS WAY WITHOUT THE CREW EVER EMERGING FROM THEIR USUAL INERTIA THEY WERE NO MORE DISTURBED BY THE PRESENCE OF THESE MAN EATERS THAN SOLDIERS IN AN ARMORED FORTRESS ARE TROUBLED BY ANTS RUNNING OVER THE ARMOR PLATE I GOT UP AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
835-130876-0073 THE HATCHES WEREN'T OPEN SO THE AIR INSIDE HADN'T BEEN RENEWED BUT THE AIR TANKS WERE KEPT FULL FOR ANY EVENTUALITY AND WOULD FUNCTION APPROPRIATELY TO SHOOT A FEW CUBIC METERS OF OXYGEN INTO THE NAUTILUS'S THIN ATMOSPHERE
835-130876-0074 I WORKED IN MY STATEROOM UNTIL NOON WITHOUT SEEING CAPTAIN NEMO EVEN FOR AN INSTANT NOBODY ON BOARD SEEMED TO BE MAKING ANY PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE
835-130876-0075 IN TEN MINUTES THE TIDE WOULD REACH ITS MAXIMUM ELEVATION
835-130876-0076 BUT SOME PRELIMINARY VIBRATIONS COULD SOON BE FELT OVER THE BOAT'S HULL I HEARD ITS PLATING GRIND AGAINST THE LIMESTONE ROUGHNESS OF THAT CORAL BASE
835-130876-0077 AT TWO THIRTY FIVE CAPTAIN NEMO APPEARED IN THE LOUNGE WE'RE ABOUT TO DEPART HE SAID AH I PUT IN I'VE GIVEN ORDERS TO OPEN THE HATCHES WHAT ABOUT THE PAPUANS
835-130876-0078 WON'T THEY COME INSIDE THE NAUTILUS HOW WILL THEY MANAGE THAT BY JUMPING DOWN THE HATCHES YOU'RE ABOUT TO OPEN PROFESSOR ARONNAX CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED SERENELY THE NAUTILUS'S HATCHES AREN'T TO BE ENTERED IN THAT FASHION EVEN WHEN THEY'RE OPEN
835-130876-0079 I GAPED AT THE CAPTAIN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HE SAID TO ME NOT IN THE LEAST WELL COME ALONG AND YOU'LL SEE I HEADED TO THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY THERE VERY PUZZLED NED LAND AND CONSEIL WATCHED THE CREWMEN OPENING THE HATCHES
835-130876-0080 WHILE A FRIGHTFUL CLAMOR AND FURIOUS SHOUTS RESOUNDED OUTSIDE THE HATCH LIDS FELL BACK ONTO THE OUTER PLATING TWENTY HORRIBLE FACES APPEARED BUT WHEN THE FIRST ISLANDER LAID HANDS ON THE COMPANIONWAY RAILING
835-130876-0081 HE RAN OFF HOWLING IN TERROR AND WILDLY PRANCING AROUND TEN OF HIS COMPANIONS FOLLOWED HIM ALL TEN MET THE SAME FATE CONSEIL WAS IN ECSTASY CARRIED AWAY BY HIS VIOLENT INSTINCTS
835-130876-0082 NED LAND LEAPED UP THE COMPANIONWAY BUT AS SOON AS HIS HANDS SEIZED THE RAILING HE WAS THROWN BACKWARD IN HIS TURN DAMNATION HE EXCLAIMED I'VE BEEN STRUCK BY A LIGHTNING BOLT
835-130876-0083 IT WAS A METAL CABLE FULLY CHARGED WITH THE SHIP'S ELECTRICITY ANYONE WHO TOUCHED IT GOT A FEARSOME SHOCK
835-130876-0084 IT COULD HONESTLY BE SAID THAT HE HAD STRETCHED BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS ASSAILANTS A NETWORK OF ELECTRICITY NO ONE COULD CLEAR WITH IMPUNITY MEANWHILE CRAZED WITH TERROR THE UNHINGED PAPUANS BEAT A RETREAT AS FOR US HALF LAUGHING
835-130876-0085 WE MASSAGED AND COMFORTED POOR NED LAND WHO WAS SWEARING LIKE ONE POSSESSED BUT JUST THEN LIFTED OFF BY THE TIDE'S FINAL UNDULATIONS THE NAUTILUS LEFT ITS CORAL BED AT EXACTLY THAT FORTIETH MINUTE PINPOINTED BY THE CAPTAIN
835-130876-0086 ITS PROPELLER CHURNED THE WAVES WITH LAZY MAJESTY GATHERING SPEED LITTLE BY LITTLE THE SHIP NAVIGATED ON THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
