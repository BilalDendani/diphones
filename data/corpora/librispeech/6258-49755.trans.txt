6258-49755-0003 MEN PRAISED HIS NAME IN WHATEVER REALM THEY TALKED OF GALLANT DEEDS IRELAND NORWAY AND WALES YEA FROM JUTLAND EVEN TO ALBANIA SINCE HE WAS PRAISED BY THE FRANK HE WAS THEREFORE ENVIED OF THE MEAN
6258-49755-0004 NEVERTHELESS BY REASON OF HIS SKILL WITH THE SPEAR HE WAS COUNTED A VERY WORSHIPFUL KNIGHT AND WAS HONOURABLY ENTREATED BY MANY A PRINCE IN DIVERS LANDS IN MILON'S OWN REALM THERE LIVED A LORD WHOSE NAME HAS GONE FROM MIND

6258-49755-0011 WHEN THE DAMSEL PERCEIVED HOW IT WAS WITH HER SHE SENT MESSAGES TO HER FRIEND TELLING HIM OF HER CASE AND MAKING GREAT SORROW I HAVE LOST MY FATHER AND ALL HIS WEALTH SAID THE LADY FOR WHEN HE HEARS OF THIS MATTER HE WILL MAKE OF ME AN EXAMPLE
6258-49755-0012 FOR SUCH WAS THE USAGE OF OUR FATHERS IN THE DAYS OF THIS TALE MILON GRIEVED SORELY AND MADE ANSWER THAT HE WOULD DO THE THING THE DAMSEL THOUGHT MOST SEEMLY TO BE DONE WHEN THE CHILD IS BORN REPLIED THE LADY

6258-49755-0017 MILON APPROVED THE COUNSEL OF THE LADY AND WHEN HER TIME HAD COME SHE WAS BROUGHT TO BED OF A BOY THE OLD NURSE WHO TENDED HER MISTRESS WAS PRIVY TO THE DAMSEL'S INMOST MIND
6258-49755-0018 SO WARILY SHE WENT TO WORK SO CUNNING WAS SHE IN GLOSS AND CONCEALMENT THAT NONE WITHIN THE PALACE KNEW THAT THERE WAS AUGHT TO HIDE THE DAMSEL LOOKED UPON HER BOY AND SAW THAT HE WAS VERY FAIR
6258-49755-0019 SHE LACED THE RING ABOUT HIS NECK AND SET THE LETTER THAT IT WERE DEATH TO FIND WITHIN A SILKEN CHATELAINE THE CHILD WAS THEN PLACED IN HIS CRADLE SWATHED CLOSE IN WHITE LINEN
6258-49755-0020 A PILLOW OF FEATHERS WAS PUT BENEATH HIS HEAD AND OVER ALL WAS LAID A WARM COVERLET WADDED WITH FUR IN THIS FASHION THE ANCIENT NURSE GAVE THE BABE TO HIS FATHER WHO AWAITED HIM WITHIN THE GARDEN
6258-49755-0021 MILON COMMENDED THE CHILD TO HIS MEN CHARGING THEM TO CARRY HIM LOYALLY BY SUCH TOWNS AS THEY KNEW TO THAT LADY BEYOND THE HUMBER THE SERVITORS SET FORTH BEARING THE INFANT WITH THEM
6258-49755-0022 SEVEN TIMES A DAY THEY REPOSED THEM IN THEIR JOURNEY SO THAT THE WOMEN MIGHT NOURISH THE BABE AND BATHE AND TEND HIM DULY THEY SERVED THEIR LORD SO FAITHFULLY KEEPING SUCH WATCH UPON THE WAY THAT AT THE LAST THEY WON TO THE LADY TO WHOM THEY WERE BIDDEN
6258-49755-0023 THE LADY RECEIVED THEM COURTEOUSLY AS BECAME HER BREEDING SHE BROKE THE SEAL OF THE LETTER AND WHEN SHE WAS ASSURED OF WHAT WAS THEREIN MARVELLOUSLY SHE CHERISHED THE INFANT THESE HAVING BESTOWED THE BOY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR LORD'S COMMANDMENT RETURNED TO THEIR OWN LAND
6258-49755-0024 MILON WENT FORTH FROM HIS REALM TO SERVE BEYOND THE SEAS FOR GUERDON HIS FRIEND REMAINED WITHIN HER HOUSE AND WAS GRANTED BY HER FATHER IN MARRIAGE TO A RIGHT RICH BARON OF THAT COUNTRY
6258-49755-0025 THOUGH THIS BARON WAS A WORTHY KNIGHT JUSTLY ESTEEMED OF ALL HIS FELLOWS THE DAMSEL WAS GRIEVED BEYOND MEASURE WHEN SHE KNEW HER FATHER'S WILL SHE CALLED TO MIND THE PAST AND REGRETTED THAT MILON HAD GONE FROM THE COUNTRY SINCE HE WOULD HAVE HELPED HER IN HER NEED
6258-49755-0026 ALAS SAID THE LADY WHAT SHALL I DO I DOUBT THAT I AM LOST FOR MY LORD WILL FIND THAT HIS BRIDE IS NOT A MAID IF THIS BECOMES KNOWN THEY WILL MAKE ME A BONDWOMAN FOR ALL MY DAYS
6258-49755-0027 WOULD THAT MY FRIEND WERE HERE TO FREE ME FROM THIS COIL IT WERE GOOD FOR ME TO DIE RATHER THAN TO LIVE BUT BY NO MEANS CAN I ESCAPE FROM THEIR HANDS THEY HAVE SET WARDERS ABOUT ME MEN OLD AND YOUNG WHOM THEY CALL MY CHAMBERLAINS
6258-49755-0028 CONTEMNERS OF LOVE WHO DELIGHT THEMSELVES IN SADNESS BUT ENDURE IT I MUST FOR ALAS I KNOW NOT HOW TO DIE SO ON THE APPOINTED DAY THE LADY WAS WEDDED TO THE BARON
6258-49755-0029 AND HER HUSBAND TOOK HER TO DWELL WITH HIM IN HIS FIEF WHEN MILON RETURNED TO HIS OWN COUNTRY HE WAS RIGHT HEAVY AND SORROWFUL TO LEARN OF THIS MARRIAGE HE LAMENTED HIS WRETCHED CASE BUT IN THIS HE FOUND COMFORT
6258-49755-0030 MILON COMMENCED TO THINK WITHIN HIMSELF HOW BEST HE MIGHT SEND LETTERS TO THE DAMSEL THAT HE WAS COME AGAIN TO HIS HOME YET SO THAT NONE SHOULD HAVE KNOWLEDGE THEREOF HE WROTE A LETTER AND SEALED IT WITH HIS SEAL
6258-49755-0031 THIS MESSAGE HE MADE FAST TO THE NECK AND HID WITHIN THE PLUMAGE OF A SWAN THAT WAS LONG HIS AND WAS GREATLY TO HIS HEART HE BADE HIS SQUIRE TO COME AND MADE HIM HIS MESSENGER
6258-49755-0032 CHANGE THY RAIMENT SWIFTLY SAID HE AND HASTEN TO THE CASTLE OF MY FRIEND TAKE WITH THEE MY SWAN AND SEE THAT NONE NEITHER SERVANT NOR HANDMAID DELIVERS THE BIRD TO MY LADY SAVE THYSELF ALONE
6258-49755-0033 THE SQUIRE DID ACCORDING TO HIS LORD'S COMMANDMENT HE MADE HIM READY QUICKLY AND WENT FORTH BEARING THE SWAN WITH HIM HE WENT BY THE NEAREST ROAD AND PASSING THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE CITY CAME BEFORE THE PORTAL OF THE CASTLE
6258-49755-0034 IN ANSWER TO HIS SUMMONS THE PORTER DREW NEAR FRIEND SAID HE HEARKEN TO ME I AM OF CAERLEON AND A FOWLER BY CRAFT WITHIN MY NETS I HAVE SNARED THE MOST MARVELLOUS SWAN IN THE WORLD
6258-49755-0035 THIS WONDROUS BIRD I WOULD BESTOW FORTHWITH UPON YOUR LADY BUT PERFORCE I MUST OFFER HER THE GIFT WITH MY OWN HAND FRIEND REPLIED THE PORTER FOWLERS ARE NOT ALWAYS WELCOMED OF LADIES
6258-49755-0036 IF YOU COME WITH ME I WILL BRING YOU WHERE I MAY KNOW WHETHER IT PLEASES MY LADY TO HAVE SPEECH WITH YOU AND TO RECEIVE YOUR GIFT THE PORTER ENTERED IN THE HALL WHERE HE FOUND NONE BUT TWO LORDS SEATED AT A GREAT TABLE PLAYING CHESS FOR THEIR DELIGHT
6258-49755-0037 HE SWIFTLY RETURNED ON HIS STEPS AND THE FOWLER WITH HIM SO FURTIVELY WITHAL THAT THE LORDS WERE NOT DISTURBED AT THEIR GAME NOR PERCEIVED AUGHT OF THE MATTER THEY WENT THEREFORE TO THE CHAMBER OF THE LADY
6258-49755-0038 IN ANSWER TO THEIR CALL THE DOOR WAS OPENED TO THEM BY A MAIDEN WHO LED THEM BEFORE HER DAME WHEN THE SWAN WAS PROFFERED TO THE LADY IT PLEASED HER TO RECEIVE THE GIFT SHE SUMMONED A VARLET OF HER HOUSEHOLD AND GAVE THE BIRD TO HIS CHARGE
6258-49755-0039 COMMANDING HIM TO KEEP IT SAFELY AND TO SEE THAT IT ATE ENOUGH AND TO SPARE LADY SAID THE SERVITOR I WILL DO YOUR BIDDING WE SHALL NEVER RECEIVE FROM ANY FOWLER ON EARTH SUCH ANOTHER BIRD AS THIS
6258-49755-0040 THE SWAN IS FIT TO SERVE AT A ROYAL TABLE FOR THE BIRD IS PLUMP AS HE IS FAIR THE VARLET PUT THE SWAN IN HIS LADY'S HANDS SHE TOOK THE BIRD KINDLY AND SMOOTHING HIS HEAD AND NECK FELT THE LETTER THAT WAS HIDDEN BENEATH ITS FEATHERS
6258-49755-0041 THE BLOOD PRICKED IN HER VEINS FOR WELL SHE KNEW THAT THE WRITING WAS SENT HER BY HER FRIEND SHE CAUSED THE FOWLER TO BE GIVEN OF HER BOUNTY AND BADE THE MEN TO GO FORTH FROM HER CHAMBER WHEN THEY HAD PARTED THE LADY CALLED A MAIDEN TO HER AID
6258-49755-0042 SHE BROKE THE SEAL AND UNFASTENING THE LETTER CAME UPON THE NAME OF MILON AT THE HEAD SHE KISSED THE NAME A HUNDRED TIMES THROUGH HER TEARS WHEN SHE MIGHT READ THE WRITING SHE LEARNED OF THE GREAT PAIN AND DOLOUR THAT HER LOVER SUFFERED BY DAY AND BY NIGHT
6258-49755-0043 STRIVE TO FIND A PLAN BY WHICH WE MAY SPEAK AS FRIEND TO FRIEND IF YOU WOULD HAVE ME LIVE THE KNIGHT PRAYED HER IN HIS LETTER TO SEND HIM AN ANSWER BY MEANS OF THE SWAN IF THE BIRD WERE WELL GUARDED AND KEPT WITHOUT PROVAND FOR THREE DAYS
6258-49755-0044 HE WOULD OF A SURETY FLY BACK TO THE PLACE FROM WHENCE HE CAME WITH ANY MESSAGE THAT THE LADY MIGHT LACE ABOUT HIS NECK
6258-49755-0045 SHE HELD HIM FOR A MONTH WITHIN HER CHAMBER BUT THIS WAS LESS FROM CHOICE THAN FOR THE CRAFT THAT WAS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN THE INK AND PARCHMENT REQUISITE FOR HER WRITING AT THE END SHE WROTE A LETTER ACCORDING TO HER HEART AND SEALED IT WITH HER RING
6258-49755-0046 THE LADY CAUSED THE SWAN TO FAST FOR THREE FULL DAYS THEN HAVING CONCEALED THE MESSAGE ABOUT HIS NECK LET HIM TAKE HIS FLIGHT THE BIRD WAS ALL ANHUNGERED FOR FOOD AND REMEMBERING WELL THE HOME FROM WHICH HE DREW HE RETURNED THITHER AS QUICKLY AS HIS WINGS MIGHT BEAR HIM
6258-49755-0047 HE KNEW AGAIN HIS TOWN AND HIS MASTER'S HOUSE AND DESCENDED TO THE GROUND AT MILON'S VERY FEET MILON REJOICED GREATLY WHEN HE MARKED HIS OWN HE CAUGHT THE BIRD BY HIS WINGS AND CRYING FOR HIS STEWARD BADE HIM GIVE THE SWAN TO EAT
6258-49755-0048 SWEET TO HIS HEART WAS THE WRITING FOR THE LADY WROTE THAT WITHOUT HIM THERE WAS NO JOY IN HER LIFE AND SINCE IT WAS HIS DESIRE TO HEAR BY THE SWAN IT WOULD BE HER PLEASURE ALSO FOR TWENTY YEARS THE SWAN WAS MADE THE MESSENGER OF THESE TWO LOVERS
6258-49755-0049 WHO MIGHT NEVER WIN TOGETHER THERE WAS NO SPEECH BETWEEN THEM SAVE THAT CARRIED BY THE BIRD THEY CAUSED THE SWAN TO FAST FOR THREE DAYS AND THEN SENT HIM ON HIS ERRAND HE TO WHOM THE LETTER CAME SAW TO IT THAT THE MESSENGER WAS FED TO HEART'S DESIRE
6258-49755-0050 MANY A TIME THE SWAN WENT UPON HIS JOURNEY FOR HOWEVER STRICTLY THE LADY WAS HELD OF HER HUSBAND THERE WAS NONE WHO HAD SUSPICION OF A BIRD THE DAME BEYOND THE HUMBER NOURISHED AND TENDED THE BOY COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE WITH THE GREATEST CARE
6258-49755-0051 WHEN HE WAS COME TO A FITTING AGE SHE MADE HIM TO BE KNIGHTED OF HER LORD FOR GOODLY AND SERVICEABLE WAS THE LAD ON THE SAME DAY THE AUNT READ OVER TO HIM THE LETTER AND PUT IN HIS HAND THE RING
6258-49755-0052 SHE TOLD HIM THE NAME OF HIS MOTHER AND HIS FATHER'S STORY IN ALL THE WORLD THERE WAS NO WORTHIER KNIGHT NOR A MORE CHIVALROUS AND GALLANT GENTLEMAN THE LAD HEARKENED DILIGENTLY TO THE LADY'S TALE
6258-49755-0053 HE REJOICED GREATLY TO HEAR OF HIS FATHER'S PROWESS AND WAS PROUD BEYOND MEASURE OF HIS RENOWN HE CONSIDERED WITHIN HIMSELF SAYING TO HIS OWN HEART THAT MUCH SHOULD BE REQUIRED OF HIS FATHER'S SON AND THAT HE WOULD NOT BE WORTHY OF HIS BLOOD IF HE DID NOT ENDEAVOUR TO MERIT HIS NAME
6258-49755-0054 HE DETERMINED THEREFORE THAT HE WOULD LEAVE HIS COUNTRY AND SEEK ADVENTURE AS A KNIGHT ERRANT BEYOND THE SEA THE VARLET DELAYED NO LONGER THAN THE EVENING ON THE MORROW HE BADE FAREWELL TO HIS AUNT
6258-49755-0055 WHO HAVING WARNED AND ADMONISHED HIM FOR HIS GOOD GAVE HIM LARGELY OF HER WEALTH TO BRING HIM ON HIS WAY HE RODE TO SOUTHAMPTON THAT HE MIGHT FIND A SHIP EQUIPPED FOR SEA AND SO CAME TO BARFLEUR WITHOUT ANY TARRYING THE LAD WENT STRAIGHT TO BRITTANY
6258-49755-0056 WHERE HE SPENT HIS MONEY AND HIMSELF IN FEASTS AND IN TOURNEYS THE RICH MEN OF THE LAND WERE GLAD OF HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR THERE WAS NONE WHO BORE HIMSELF BETTER IN THE PRESS WITH SPEAR OR WITH SWORD
6258-49755-0057 WHAT HE TOOK FROM THE RICH HE BESTOWED ON SUCH KNIGHTS AS WERE POOR AND LUCKLESS THESE LOVED HIM GREATLY SINCE HE GAINED LARGELY AND SPENT FREELY GRANTING OF HIS WEALTH TO ALL WHEREVER THIS KNIGHT SOJOURNED IN THE REALM HE BORE AWAY THE PRIZE
6258-49755-0058 SO DEBONAIR WAS HE AND CHIVALROUS THAT HIS FAME AND PRAISE CROSSED THE WATER AND WERE NOISED ABROAD IN HIS OWN LAND FOLK TOLD HOW A CERTAIN KNIGHT FROM BEYOND THE HUMBER WHO HAD PASSED THE SEA IN QUEST OF WEALTH AND HONOUR HAD SO DONE
6258-49755-0059 THAT BY REASON OF HIS PROWESS HIS LIBERALITY AND HIS MODESTY MEN CALLED HIM THE KNIGHT PEERLESS SINCE THEY DID NOT KNOW HIS NAME THIS PRAISE OF THE GOOD KNIGHT AND OF HIS DEEDS CAME TO BE HEARD OF MILON
6258-49755-0060 VERY DOLENT WAS HE AND SORELY TROUBLED THAT SO YOUNG A KNIGHT SHOULD BE ESTEEMED ABOVE HIS FATHERS HE MARVELLED GREATLY THAT THE STOUT SPEARS OF THE PAST HAD NOT PUT ON THEIR HARNESS AND BROKEN A LANCE FOR THEIR ANCIENT HONOUR ONE THING HE DETERMINED
6258-49755-0061 THAT HE WOULD CROSS THE SEA WITHOUT DELAY SO THAT HE MIGHT JOUST WITH THE DANSELLON AND ABATE HIS PRIDE IN WRATH AND ANGER HE PURPOSED TO FIGHT TO BEAT HIS ADVERSARY FROM THE SADDLE AND BRING HIM AT LAST TO SHAME
6258-49755-0062 AFTER THIS WAS ENDED HE WOULD SEEK HIS SON OF WHOM HE HAD HEARD NOTHING SINCE HE HAD GONE FROM HIS AUNT'S CASTLE MILON CAUSED HIS FRIEND TO KNOW OF HIS WISHES HE OPENED OUT TO HER ALL HIS THOUGHT AND CRAVED HER PERMISSION TO DEPART
6258-49755-0063 THIS LETTER HE SENT BY THE SWAN COMMENDING THE BIRD TO HER CARE WHEN THE LADY HEARD OF HER LOVER'S PURPOSE SHE THANKED HIM FOR HIS COURTESY FOR GREATLY WAS HIS COUNSEL TO HER MIND SHE APPROVED HIS DESIRE TO QUIT THE REALM FOR THE SAKE OF HIS HONOUR
6258-49755-0064 AND FAR FROM PUTTING LET AND HINDRANCE IN HIS PATH TRUSTED THAT IN THE END HE WOULD BRING AGAIN HER SON SINCE MILON WAS ASSURED OF HIS FRIEND'S GOODWILL HE ARRAYED HIMSELF RICHLY AND CROSSING THE SEA TO NORMANDY CAME AFTERWARDS INTO THE LAND OF THE BRETONS
6258-49755-0065 THERE HE SOUGHT THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE LORDS OF THAT REALM AND FARED TO ALL THE TOURNAMENTS OF WHICH HE MIGHT HEAR MILON BORE HIMSELF PROUDLY AND GAVE GRACIOUSLY OF HIS WEALTH AS THOUGH HE WERE RECEIVING A GIFT

6258-49755-0069 HE INQUIRED DILIGENTLY OF THE YOUNG CHAMPION AND ALL MEN WERE READY TO TELL FROM WHENCE HE CAME AND OF HIS HARNESS AND OF THE BLAZON ON HIS SHIELD AT LENGTH THE KNIGHT APPEARED IN THE LISTS AND MILON LOOKED UPON THE ADVERSARY HE SO GREATLY DESIRED TO SEE
6258-49755-0070 NOW IN THIS TOURNAMENT A KNIGHT COULD JOUST WITH THAT LORD WHO WAS SET OVER AGAINST HIM OR HE COULD SEEK TO BREAK A LANCE WITH HIS CHOSEN FOE
6258-49755-0071 AND HE MIGHT FIND HIMSELF OPPOSED EITHER BY HIS COMRADE OR HIS ENEMY MILON DID WELL AND WORSHIPFULLY IN THE PRESS AND WAS PRAISED OF MANY THAT DAY BUT THE KNIGHT PEERLESS CARRIED THE CRY FROM ALL HIS FELLOWS FOR NONE MIGHT STAND BEFORE HIM NOR RIVAL HIM IN SKILL AND ADDRESS
6258-49755-0072 MILON OBSERVED HIM CURIOUSLY THE LAD STRUCK SO HEAVILY HE THRUST HOME SO SHREWDLY THAT MILON'S HATRED CHANGED TO ENVY AS HE WATCHED VERY COMELY SHOWED THE VARLET AND MUCH TO MILON'S MIND
6258-49755-0073 THE OLDER KNIGHT SET HIMSELF OVER AGAINST THE CHAMPION AND THEY MET TOGETHER IN THE CENTRE OF THE FIELD MILON STRUCK HIS ADVERSARY SO FIERCELY THAT THE LANCE SPLINTERED IN HIS GAUNTLET BUT THE YOUNG KNIGHT KEPT HIS SEAT WITHOUT EVEN LOSING A STIRRUP
6258-49755-0074 IN RETURN HIS SPEAR WAS AIMED WITH SUCH CUNNING THAT HE BORE HIS ANTAGONIST TO THE GROUND MILON LAY UPON THE EARTH BAREHEADED FOR HIS HELMET WAS UNLACED IN THE SHOCK
