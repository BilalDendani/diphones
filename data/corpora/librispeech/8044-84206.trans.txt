8044-84206-0005 THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN WATCHING US MORE OR LESS THEN THEY'VE SEEN US HUNTING FOR A HIDING PLACE FOR THE PONIES AND MULES YES OF COURSE AND CLIMBING ABOUT AMONG THE ROCKS AT THE NARROWS TO BE SURE THEY HAVE THEN WHAT'S THE GOOD OF OUR GOING ON
8044-84206-0006 EVERYTHING IS THE GOOD THEY'VE SEEN EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE BUT THEY COULDN'T THINK WITH OUR BRAINS COULD THEY MY LAD BUT WHAT COULD THEY THINK OF OUR HUNTING ABOUT AS WE DID
8044-84206-0007 WELL SEEING THAT I MADE A POINT OF SHOOTING A BIRD OR TWO EACH TIME WE WERE PLANNING OUT OUR PLACES AND ALL WE MEANT TO DO I SHOULD SAY THAT THEY THOUGHT WE WERE PROVIDING FOR THE POT NOW THEN COME AND HAVE A TURN AT YOUR PONY AND SPEND A GOOD DEAL OF TIME LOOKING AT HIS HURTS

8044-84206-0010 THEY KNOW THERE ARE RIFLES AND GOOD SHOTS UP AT THE TOP YONDER AND I DARE SAY SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN HIT NOW COME ALONG THE PAIR STROLLED OUT TOWARDS WHERE THE ANIMALS WERE GRAZING
8044-84206-0011 AND WENT THROUGH THE BIT OF PERFORMANCE ARRANGED CHRIS MARVELLING THE WHILE AT THE PERFECT COOLNESS DISPLAYED BY HIS COMPANION WHO WAS ON THE BRINK OF A MOST DARING ADVENTURE THE VERY THOUGHT OF WHICH SENT THE BLOOD DANCING THROUGH THE BOY'S VEINS AND MADE THE PALMS OF HIS HANDS TURN WET
8044-84206-0012 THE SHADES OF NIGHT WERE APPROACHING AS AFTER A LONG EXAMINATION OF CHRIS'S PONY THE ANIMALS WERE HEADED TOWARDS THE CAMP AND DRIVEN SLOWLY IN TOWARDS WHERE THEY WERE REGULARLY WATERED EVERY NIGHT AND SO WELL HAD ALL THE PREPARATIONS BEEN TIMED
8044-84206-0013 THAT IT WAS TOO DARK FOR ANY SCOUTS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE TO SEE THAT AFTER THE WATERING EVERY BEAST WAS HOBBLED AND HELD IN READINESS FOR THE START THAT WAS TO BE MADE AND NOW THE BUSINESS PREPARATORY TO THE START WAS SET ABOUT EAGERLY
8044-84206-0014 THE MULES WERE LADEN WITH THE MUCH REDUCED LOADS SKEETER HAD HIS BUT HIS BELL WAS MUFFLED SO THAT IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY SILENT AND THE WATER BARRELS WERE HUNG IN POSITION ACROSS THE BACK OF THEIR REGULAR BEARER
8044-84206-0015 THERE WAS PLENTY OF TIME AND THE DOCTOR'S PRINCIPAL EFFORTS WERE DIRECTED TOWARDS ARRESTING HURRY
8044-84206-0016 IF THEY HAVE GONE BACK HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE AS THE ADVENTUROUS PARTY SAT TOGETHER TALKING IN A LOW TONE EACH WITH HIS WEAPONS READY YES SAID WILTON IF THEY HAVE GONE BACK SUPPOSE THEY HAVE CHOSEN THIS OF ALL NIGHTS FOR AN ATTACK
8044-84206-0017 BUT IT IS POSSIBLE SAID BOURNE SADLY SO'S EVERYTHING ELSE SIR REPLIED THE AMERICAN BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT'S A PITY TO BEGIN FANCYING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN PERHAPS SO SAID BOURNE I BEG PARDON I'M AFRAID I DO ANTICIPATE A GOOD DEAL
8044-84206-0018 WELL BOYS HE ADDED TURNING TO WHERE THE PAIR SAT TOGETHER WHISPERING HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT TO NIGHT'S WORK HORRID FATHER WHISPERED NED AS IF HE FELT THAT INDIANS MIGHT BE LISTENING AND YOU CHRIS CONTINUED BOURNE
8044-84206-0019 I FEEL AS IF I SHALL BE GLAD WHEN IT'S TO MORROW AND WE KNOW THE WORST OR THE BEST MY BOY SAID THE DOCTOR CHEERILY THERE I THINK WE MIGHT START NOW THE MOON HAS SET AND WE HAVE A LONG DARK NIGHT BEFORE US FOR OUR WORK
8044-84206-0020 READY AND WILLING SIR I GO FIRST DON'T I YES WITH CHRIS AS ADVANCE GUARD
8044-84206-0021 ONE SHOT EACH AND THEN YOU STAND FAST TO GIVE US TIME TO START THE TRAIN BACK BEFORE COMING TO YOUR SUPPORT YES SIR IT'S ALL CUT DEEP INTO ME BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHALL HAVE ANY TROUBLE THERE I HOPE NOT SAID THE DOCTOR
8044-84206-0022 WITHIN HALF AN HOUR FROM THESE WORDS BEING SPOKEN THE LITTLE BAGGAGE TRAIN WAS IN MOTION DIMLY SEEN BENEATH THE BAND OF STARS OVERHEAD
8044-84206-0023 THESE STOOD OUT STRONGLY MARKED AGAINST THE EDGE OF THE BLACK CLIFFS ON EITHER SIDE TOWERING UP AND SEEMING TO THE EXCITED IMAGINATION OF THE TWO LADS DOUBLE THEIR REAL HEIGHT AND OVERHANGING MORE AND MORE AS THE VALLEY SIDES GRADUALLY CLOSED IN TOWARDS THE MOUTH OF THE GULCH
8044-84206-0024 CHRIS SUFFERED FROM A PECULIAR SENSE OF EXCITEMENT AND DREAD OF ATTACK AS HE AND GRIGGS RODE CAUTIOUSLY ON THROUGH THE DARKNESS EACH WITH HIS RIFLE COCKED AND RESTING UPON HIS KNEE STRAINING HIS EYES THE WHILE FOR THE FIRST SIGN OF DANGER
8044-84206-0025 AND IT WAS DURING THIS RIDE THAT THE BOY BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER THE EYESIGHT OF THE INDIANS WAS MUCH BETTER THAN THEIR OWN FOR HE SOON FOUND THAT ONCE MORE HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE OUT ANY ATTEMPT AT GUIDANCE AND TRUST ENTIRELY TO HIS PONY
8044-84206-0026 THINK THE ENEMY CAN SEE BETTER THAN WE DO HE VENTURED TO SAY DURING A TEMPORARY HALT TO MAKE OUT IF POSSIBLE WHAT HAD CAUSED A SUDDEN RUSHING SOUND THROUGH THE BUSHES IN FRONT
8044-84206-0027 THEY'RE MADE DIFFERENTLY TO WHAT WE ARE IF THEY CAN WHISPERED THE AMERICAN DRYLY I'M LEAVING EVERYTHING TO MY NAG AND YOU'D BETTER DO THE SAME THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING SAID CHRIS YOU DON'T THINK THAT WAS AN INDIAN THEN NO ONLY SOME LITTLE ANIMAL THAT WE STARTED
8044-84206-0028 IT SOUNDED LOUD BECAUSE EVERYTHING'S SO STILL AND WE EXPECT THAT EVERYTHING MEANS DANGER KEEP CLOSE BEHIND ME NOW
8044-84206-0029 AND THEY WENT ON AND ON THROUGH THE DARKNESS TILL GRIGGS SUDDENLY DREW REIN HERE WE ARE HE WHISPERED IT'S NARROW ENOUGH AND IT OUGHTN'T TO TAKE MANY MINUTES TO STOP THIS GAP SO THAT NO HORSE COULD GET THROUGH
8044-84206-0030 WHILE IN AN HOUR IT MIGHT BE MADE SO THAT IT WOULD TAKE A WEEK TO MAKE IT PASSABLE COME ALONG AND MIND WE DON'T MISS THE GULLY HE LED ON AGAIN SLOWLY PAUSING AT INTERVALS TO LISTEN AND MAKE SURE
8044-84206-0031 ONCE MORE GRIGGS STOPPED SHORT AND CHRIS'S HEART BEGAN TO BEAT MORE HEAVILY THAN EVER DURING THE FEW MINUTES SILENCE THAT ENSUED I'M DONE WHISPERED GRIGGS AT LAST WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED CHRIS
8044-84206-0032 THE GULLY OUGHT TO BE SOMEWHERE ABOUT HERE BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CAN'T MAKE OUT WHERE IT IS AND WE MUST WAIT TILL MORNING CHRIS LAUGHED SOFTLY I DON'T SEE ANYTHING TO GRIN AT GRUMBLED GRIGGS I DON'T BELIEVE ANY INDIAN COULD FIND HIS WAY ALONG HERE
8044-84206-0033 I WAS LAUGHING BECAUSE I COULD FIND THE PLACE HOW ASKED GRIGGS SHARPLY BY COMING FIRST MY PONY KNOWS HIS WAY HERE COME IN FRONT SAID GRIGGS SHORTLY
8044-84206-0034 AND CHRIS MOVED FORWARD GAVE THE PONY HIS HEAD ONCE MORE AND THE CLEVER LITTLE ANIMAL PACED STEADILY ON FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS AND THEN TURNED OFF TO ITS LEFT AND BEGAN TO ASCEND HAH WHO WOULDN'T BE A PONY SAID GRIGGS AS CHRIS DREW REIN
8044-84206-0035 THEN ALL WE HAVE TO DO NOW IS TO WAIT TILL THEY COME UP IT DID NOT SEEM LONG BEFORE THE DOCTOR JOINED THEM AND THEN THE WHOLE TRAIN FILED UP THE SIDE GULLY
8044-84206-0036 WHERE THE GRASSY PATCH IN A HOLLOW HAD BEEN SELECTED OFF THE TRACK AND HERE THE HALT WAS MADE THE BEASTS BEGINNING TO GRAZE AT ONCE
8044-84206-0037 IT'S A RISK INDEED SAID THE DOCTOR IF THE INDIANS SHOULD HAPPEN TO RIDE IN THIS DIRECTION WHERE SHOULD WE BE SHOOTING AT THEM WOULD BE THE BEST THING SAID WILTON IT'S A THOUSAND TO ONE AGAINST THEIR FINDING THE BEASTS HERE SAID GRIGGS
8044-84206-0038 EVEN IF THEY DID HAPPEN TO COME BUT WE'VE GOT TO CHANCE IT SIR EVERYTHING'S GONE RIGHT SO FAR AND LET'S HOPE WE SHALL KEEP ON THE SAME TRACK I HOPE SO REPLIED THE DOCTOR THEN NOW WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT GET BACK TO THE NARROW GATEWAY
8044-84206-0039 THE SOONER THE BETTER SIR FOR THE NIGHT'S WEARING AWAY FAST BUT OUGHT WE AFTER ALL TO LEAVE ONE OF US IN CHARGE OF THE BEASTS HERE NO SIR SAID GRIGGS SHARPLY
8044-84206-0040 YOU'LL WANT ALL YOUR STRENGTH AFTER I'VE PASSED TO TUMBLE DOWN THE ROCKS THE MORE THE BETTER IT MUSTN'T BE HALF DONE NO SAID THE DOCTOR GRAVELY THE ENTRANCE MUST BE WELL BLOCKED ALL READY YES CAME IN A WHISPER
8044-84206-0041 BACK THEN AT ONCE GRIGGS WILL LEAD AND ALL KEEP IN TOUCH AND OBSERVE PERFECT SILENCE THE DISTANCE SEEMED TO HAVE DOUBLED BEFORE THEY GOT TO THE DESCENT AND THIS SLOPE TO BE THREE TIMES AS LONG AS THEY TRAMPED SLOWLY DOWN INTO THE GULCH
8044-84206-0042 WHERE THE DOCTOR CALLED A HALT ONCE MORE BUT ALL WAS STILL AND BLACKER THAN EVER AS GRIGGS WITH CHRIS AT HIS SIDE TURNED OFF TO THE RIGHT TO LEAD THE PARTY SLOWLY ONWARD TOWARDS THE NARROWS WHERE ALL STOOD AT LAST HOT AND WEARY
8044-84206-0043 EVERYTHING SEEMS TO HAVE STRETCHED OUT SAID GRIGGS IN A WHISPER I THOUGHT WE WERE NEVER GOING TO GET HERE THEN TO THE DOCTOR
8044-84206-0044 NO SAID THE DOCTOR THAT MIGHT MEAN FAILURE EVERY ONE MUST BE IN HIS PLACE BEFORE THE DARKNESS FAILS US YES I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT SIR BUT MAKE SURE AS SOON AS THERE'S LIGHT ENOUGH THAT EVERY ONE IS WELL HIDDEN
8044-84206-0045 BIRDS WILL NOT ENTER A TRAP IF THEY SEE ANYTHING STRANGE NOR INDIANS NEITHER SAID THE DOCTOR QUIETLY WE SHALL SEE TO THAT AND YOU'LL LET THEM GET WELL OUT OF HEARING BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO STOP THE GAP OF COURSE SAID THE DOCTOR
8044-84206-0046 THAT'S ALL RIGHT THEN SAID GRIGGS SO NOW AS YOU ARE GOING TO DIVIDE INTO TWO PARTIES EACH TO TAKE A SIDE I'LL SAY GOOD BYE AND STOP BELOW
8044-84206-0047 THAT'S RIGHT SIR I'LL SAY MY LESSON AS SOON AS IT'S DAYBREAK I SHALL MOVE DOWN THE GULLY RIGHT ON IN THE DIRECTION WHERE I BELIEVE THE INDIANS ARE ENCAMPED AND AS SOON AS I THINK I'M NEAR ENOUGH I'M GOING TO BEGIN SHOOTING WHEREVER I SEE A CHANCE AND PICKING UP MY BIRDS
8044-84206-0048 TILL THE INDIANS HEAR ME AND COME OUT TO SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER THEN WE SUPPOSE THEY'LL MOUNT THE WHOLE HERD OF THEM AND COME AFTER ME MOUNTED MEN AGAINST ONE ON FOOT SAID THE DOCTOR WITH A SIGH I DON'T SUPPOSE THEY'LL CATCH ME SAID GRIGGS COOLLY
8044-84206-0049 WELL NATURALLY ENOUGH WHEN I SEE THE ENEMY AFTER ME I BEGIN TO RUN BUT SUPPOSE THEY DON'T ALL COME GRIGGS SAID CHRIS SHAN'T SUPPOSE ANYTHING OF THE KIND AND DON'T YOU TALK SO LOUDLY GROWLED THE AMERICAN
8044-84206-0050 AND COME CROWDING AFTER ME I RUN AS I NEVER RAN BEFORE STRAIGHT FOR THE NARROW WAY HERE DASH THROUGH MAKING FOR THE OLD CAMP AND THEY TEAR AWAY TO CUT ME OFF BEFORE I CAN GET UNDER COVER OF OUR MARKSMEN
8044-84206-0051 BUT ALL AT ONCE I DODGE IN AMONG THE STONES AND BEGIN TO CLIMB UP TO THE TERRACES GET UP TO THE TOP STEP WAY IN THE SQUARE PIT AND LOOSEN OUT THE STONES THERE AFTER BLOCKING THE PLACE BELOW
8044-84206-0052 AND WHEN I BEGIN TO FIRE AT THEM PRETTY SHARPLY THEY'LL TURN BACK AT ONCE GET TO THEIR HORSES AND JOIN THEIR MATES TO HAVE A PALAVER AND COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT ISN'T SAFE TO STOP IN THE VALLEY BECAUSE THEY'LL BE EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT FOR FIRE TO BE OPENED BY US
8044-84206-0053 THEN THEY'LL RIDE BACK WITHOUT ANOTHER SHOT BEING FIRED AT THEM FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT I'M HURRYING ROUND TO JOIN YOUR PEOPLE HERE BY THE TOP WAY AND THE GULLY I SHAN'T LOSE ANY TIME AND IF I'M LUCKY I MAY GET HERE SOON ENOUGH TO JOIN YOU IN GIVING THE ENEMY A FEW BULLETS
8044-84206-0054 WHEN THEY COME RIDING BACK TO FIND THEIR WAY STOPPED AS IT OUGHT TO BE SAID THE DOCTOR DUBIOUSLY
