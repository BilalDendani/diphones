3318-164981-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR THE FIRE COUNTRY AGAIN THE SUN ROSE BRIGHTLY THE NEXT MORNING AND WHEN AB ARMED AND WATCHFUL ROLLED THE BIG STONE AWAY AND PASSED THE SMOLDERING FIRE AND ISSUED FROM THE CAVE INTO THE OPEN THE SCENE HE LOOKED UPON WAS FAIR IN EVERY WAY
3318-164981-0001 OF WHAT HAD BEEN LEFT OF THE GREAT BEAR NOT A TRACE REMAINED EVEN THE BONES HAD BEEN DRAGGED INTO THE FOREST BY THE RAVENING CREATURES WHO HAD FED THERE DURING THE NIGHT THERE WERE BIRDS SINGING AND THERE WERE NO ENEMIES IN SIGHT
3318-164981-0002 AB CALLED TO LIGHTFOOT AND THE TWO WENT FORTH TOGETHER LOVING AND BRAVE BUT NO LONGER CARELESS IN THAT TOO INTERESTING REGION AND SO BEGAN THE HOME LIFE OF THESE TWO PEOPLE
3318-164981-0003 IT WAS IN ITS WAY AND RELATIVELY AS SWEET AND DELICIOUS AS THE FIRST HOME LIFE OF ANY LOVING AND APPRECIATING MAN AND WOMAN OF TO DAY THE TWO WERE VERY CLOSE AS THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY LIVED DEMANDED
3318-164981-0004 THEY WERE THE ONLY HUMAN BEINGS WITHIN A RADIUS OF MILES THE FAMILY OF THE CAVE MAN OF THE TIME WAS SERENELY INDEPENDENT EACH HAVING ITS OWN TERRITORY AND DEPENDING UPON ITSELF FOR ITS EXISTENCE
3318-164981-0005 AB TAUGHT LIGHTFOOT THE ART OF CRACKING AWAY THE FLAKES OF THE FLINT NODULES AND OF THE FINER CHIPPING AND RASPING WHICH MADE PERFECT THE SPEAR AND ARROWHEADS
3318-164981-0006 HE TAUGHT HER TOO THE USE OF HIS NEW WEAPON AND IN ALL HIS LIFE HE DID NO WISER THING IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE SHE BECAME EASILY HIS SUPERIOR WITH THE BOW
3318-164981-0007 HER ARROWS FLEW WITH GREATER ACCURACY THAN HIS THOUGH THE BUZZING SHAFT HAD NOT AS YET AND DID NOT HAVE FOR MANY CENTURIES LATER THE GRAY GOOSE FEATHER WHICH MADE THE DOING OF ITS MISSION FAR MORE CERTAIN LIGHTFOOT BROUGHT TO THE CAVE THE CAPERCAILZIE
3318-164981-0008 AND WILLOW GROUSE AND OTHER BIRDS WHICH WERE GOOD THINGS FOR THE LARDER AND AB LOOKED ON ADMIRINGLY EVEN IN THEIR JOINT HUNTING WHEN THERE WAS A HALF RIVALRY HE WAS HAPPY IN HER SOMEHOW THE ARROW SANG MORE MERRILY WHEN IT FLEW FROM LIGHTFOOT'S BOW
3318-164981-0009 BETTER THAN AB TOO COULD THE YOUNG WIFE DO RARE CLIMBING WHEN IN A NEST FAR OUT UPON SOME BRANCH WERE EGGS GOOD FOR ROASTING AND WHICH COULD BE REACHED ONLY BY A LIGHT WEIGHT AND SHE LEARNED THE WOODS ABOUT THEM WELL AND THOUGH EVER DREADING WHEN ALONE
3318-164981-0010 FOUND WHERE WERE THE TREES FROM WHICH FELL THE GREATEST STORE OF NUTS
3318-164981-0011 BUT NEVER DID THE HUNTER LEAVE THE CAVE WITHOUT A FEAR EVER EVEN IN THE DAYTIME WAS THERE TOO MUCH RUSTLING AMONG THE LEAVES OF THE NEAR FOREST
3318-164981-0012 EVER AT NIGHT LOOKING OUT THROUGH THE NARROW SPACE BETWEEN THE HEAPED ROCKS COULD THE TWO INSIDE THE CAVE SEE FIERCE AND BLAZING EYES AND THERE WOULD COME TO THEM THE SOUND OF SNARLS AND GROWLS AS THE BEASTS OF DIFFERENT QUALITY MET ONE ANOTHER
3318-164981-0013 YET THE TWO CARED LITTLE FOR THESE FEARFUL SURROUNDINGS OF THE DARKNESS THEY WERE SAFE ENOUGH IN THE MORNING THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF THE LURKING BEASTS OF PREY THEY WERE SOMEWHERE NEAR THOUGH AND WAITING AND SO AB AND LIGHTFOOT HAD THE STRAIN OF CONSTANT WATCHFULNESS UPON THEM
3318-164981-0014 IT MAY BE THAT BECAUSE OF THIS EVER PRESENT PERIL THE TWO GREW CLOSER TOGETHER IT COULD NOT WELL BE OTHERWISE WITH HUMAN BEINGS THUS BOUND AND ISOLATED AND FACING AND LIVING UPON THE REST OF NATURE PART OF IT SEEKING ALWAYS THEIR OWN LIVES
3318-164981-0015 THEY BECAME A WONDERFULLY LOVING COUPLE AS LOVE WENT IN THAT RUDE TIME DESPITE THE TOO WEARING OUTLOOK IMPOSED UPON THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE IN SO DANGEROUS A LOCALITY THEY WERE VERY HAPPY YET ONE DAY CAME A DIFFERENCE AND A HURT
3318-164981-0016 OAK APPARENTLY FORGOTTEN BY OTHERS WAS REMEMBERED BY AB THOUGH NEVER SPOKEN OF SOMETIMES THE MAN HAD TOSSED UPON HIS BED OF LEAVES AND HAD MUTTERED IN HIS SLEEP
3318-164981-0017 THERE WAS NO ANSWER BUT THE LOOK OF THE MAN OF WHOM SHE HAD ASKED THE QUESTION WAS SUCH THAT SHE WAS GLAD TO CREEP FROM HIS SIGHT UNHARMED
3318-164981-0018 YET ONCE AGAIN MONTHS LATER SHE FORGOT HERSELF AND MOCKED AB WHEN HE HAD BEEN BOASTFUL OVER SOME EXPLOIT OF STRENGTH AND COURAGE AND WHEN HE HAD SEEMED TO SAY THAT HE KNEW NO FEAR
3318-164981-0019 OAK OAK AS SHE HAD SEEN AB DO AT NIGHT
3318-164981-0020 WITH A SHUDDER AND THEN WITH A GLARE IN HIS EYES THE MAN LEAPED TOWARD HER SNATCHING HIS GREAT AX FROM HIS BELT AND SWINGING IT ABOVE HER HEAD THE WOMAN SHRIEKED AND SHRANK TO THE GROUND THE MAN WHIRLED THE WEAPON ALOFT AND THEN HIS FACE TWITCHING CONVULSIVELY CHECKED ITS DESCENT
3318-164981-0021 HE MAY IN THAT MOMENT HAVE THOUGHT OF WHAT FOLLOWED THE SLAYING OF THE OTHER WHO HAD BEEN CLOSE TO HIM THERE WAS NO DEATH DONE BUT THENCEFORTH LIGHTFOOT NEVER UTTERED ALOUD THE NAME OF OAK SHE BECAME MORE SEDATE AND GRAVE OF BEARING THE EPISODE WAS BUT A PASSING
3318-164981-0022 THE MONTHS WENT BY AND THERE WERE TRANQUIL HOURS IN THE CAVE AS AT NIGHT THE WEAPONS WERE SHAPED AND LIGHTFOOT BOASTED OF THE ARROWHEADS SHE HAD LEARNED TO MAKE SO WELL SOMETIMES OLD MOK WOULD BE ROWED UP THE RIVER TO THEM BY THE STURDY AND VENTURESOME BARK
3318-164981-0023 WHO HAD GROWN INTO A PARTICULARLY FINE YOUTH AND WHO NOW CARED FOR NOTHING MORE THAN HIS BIG BROTHER'S ADMIRATION BETWEEN OLD MOK AND LIGHTFOOT TO AB'S GREAT DELIGHT GREW UP THE WARMEST FRIENDSHIP
3318-164981-0024 THE OLD MAN TAUGHT THE WOMAN MORE OF THE DETAILS OF GOOD ARROW MAKING AND ALL HE KNEW OF WOODCRAFT IN ALL WAYS AND THE LORD OF THE PLACE SOON FOUND HIS WIFE GIVING OPINIONS WITH AN AIR OF THE UTMOST KNOWLEDGE AND AUTHORITY
3318-164981-0025 WHATEVER CAME TO HIM FROM HER AND OLD MOK PLEASED HIM AND WHEN SHE TOLD HIM OF SOME OF THE FINER POINTS OF ARROW MAKING HE STRETCHED OUT HIS BRAWNY ARMS AND LAUGHED BUT THERE CAME IN TIME A SHADE UPON THE FACE OF THE MAN
3318-164981-0026 WHY SHOULD NOT HE AND LIGHTFOOT SEIZE UPON THIS HOME AND LIVE THERE IT WAS A WONDERFUL PLACE AND WARM AND THERE WERE FORESTS AT HAND
3318-164981-0027 THAT THE WOMAN WHO WAS HIS COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIS MOOD BUT ONE DAY HE TOLD HER OF WHAT HE HAD BEEN THINKING AND OF WHAT HE HAD RESOLVED UPON I AM GOING TO THE FIRE COUNTRY HE SAID ARMED THIS TIME WITH SPEAR AND AX AND BOW AND ARROW
3318-164981-0028 AND WITH FOOD ABUNDANT IN THE POUCH OF HIS SKIN GARB AB LEFT THE CAVE IN WHICH LIGHTFOOT WAS NOW TO STAY MOST OF THE TIME WELL BARRICADED FOR THAT SHE WAS TO HUNT AFAR ALONE IN SUCH A REGION WAS NOT EVEN TO BE THOUGHT OF
3318-164981-0029 WHAT THOUGHTS CAME TO THE MAN AS HE TRAVERSED AGAIN THE FOREST PATHS WHERE HE HAD SO PONDERED AS HE ONCE RAN BEFORE CAN BE BUT GUESSED AT
3318-164981-0030 LIGHTFOOT LEFT ALONE IN THE CAVE BECAME AT ONCE A MOST DISCREET AND CAREFUL PERSONAGE FOR ONE OF HER BUOYANT AND DARING TEMPERAMENT SHE HAD OFTEN TAKEN RISKS SINCE HER MARRIAGE
3318-164981-0031 BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CHANCE OF FINDING WITHIN THE SOUND OF HER VOICE HER BIG MATE AB SHOULD DANGER OVERTAKE HER SHE REMAINED CLOSE TO THE CAVE AND WHEN EARLY DUSK CAME SHE LUGGED THE STONE BARRIERS INTO PLACE AND BUILT A NIGHT FIRE WITHIN THE ENTRANCE
3318-164981-0032 LURKING AND SNIFFING HARSHLY ABOUT THE ENTRANCE AND WHEN SHE VENTURED THERE AND PEERED OUTSIDE SHE SAW THE WICKED AND LEERING EYES ALONE AND A LITTLE ALARMED SHE BECAME MORE VENGEFUL THAN SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH THE BIG CARELESS AB BESIDE HER
3318-164981-0033 SHE WOULD HAVE SPORT WITH HER BOW
3318-164981-0034 AN ARROW MAY BE SENT THROUGH A MERE LOOPHOLE WITH NO PROBABLE DEMERIT AS TO WHAT IT WILL ACCOMPLISH SO THE WOMAN BROUGHT HER STRONGEST BOW AND FAR BEYOND THE ROUGH BOW OF AB'S FIRST MAKE WAS THE BOW THEY NOW POSSESSED
3318-164981-0035 AND GATHERED TOGETHER MANY OF THE ARROWS SHE COULD MAKE SO WELL AND USE SO WELL AND THUS EQUIPPED WENT AGAIN TO THE CAVE'S ENTRANCE
3318-164981-0036 OR CAVE HYENA SHAFTS TO WHICH THEY WERE UNACCUSTOMED BUT WHICH SOMEHOW PIERCED AND COULD FIND MID BODY QUITE AS WELL AS THE CAVE MAN'S SPEAR THERE WAS A CERTAIN COMFORT IN THE WORK THOUGH IT COULD NOT AFFECT HER CONDITION IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
3318-164981-0037 IT WAS ONLY SOMETHING OF A GAIN TO DRIVE THE EYES AWAY
3318-164981-0038 AND STUDIED ALL THE QUALITIES OF THE NATURALLY DEFENDED VALLEY I WILL MAKE MY HOME HERE HE SAID LIGHTFOOT SHALL COME WITH ME THE MAN RETURNED TO HIS CAVE AND HIS LONELY MATE AGAIN AND TOLD HER OF THE FIRE COUNTRY HE SAID THAT IN THE FIRE VALLEY THEY WOULD BE SAFER AND HAPPIER
3318-164981-0039 NOT THAT A CAVE WAS REALLY NEEDED IN A FIRE VALLEY BUT THEY MIGHT HAVE ONE IF THEY CARED AND LIGHTFOOT WAS GLAD OF THE DEPARTURE THE PAIR GATHERED THEIR BELONGINGS TOGETHER AND THERE WAS THE LONG JOURNEY OVER AGAIN WHICH AB HAD JUST ACCOMPLISHED
3318-164981-0040 BUT IT WAS FAR DIFFERENT FROM EITHER JOURNEY THAT HE HAD MADE THERE WITH HIM WAS HIS WIFE AND HE WAS ALL EQUIPPED AND WAS TO BEGIN A NEW SORT OF LIFE WHICH WOULD HE FELT BE GOOD LIGHTFOOT BEARING HER LOAD GALLANTLY WAS NOT LESS JUBILANT
3318-164981-0041 AS A MATTER OF PLAIN FACT THOUGH LIGHTFOOT HAD BEEN HAPPY IN THE CAVE IN THE FOREST SHE HAD ALWAYS RECOGNIZED CERTAIN OF ITS DISADVANTAGES AS HAD IN THE END HER FEARLESS HUSBAND
3318-164981-0042 AND THEN LODGMENT IN THE MAW OF SOME IMPOSING CREATURE OF THE CARNIVORA LIGHTFOOT WAS QUITE READY TO SEEK WITH AB THE FIRE VALLEY OF WHICH HE HAD SO OFTEN TOLD HER SHE WAS A PLUCKY YOUNG MATRON BUT THERE WERE EXTREMES THERE WERE NO ADVENTURES ON THE JOURNEY WORTH RELATING
3318-164981-0043 THE FIRE VALLEY WAS REACHED AT NIGHTFALL AND THE TWO STRUGGLED WEARIEDLY UP THE RUGGED PATH BESIDE THE CREEK WHICH ISSUED FROM THE VALLEY'S WESTERN END AS THEY REACHED THE LEVEL AB THREW DOWN HIS BURDEN AS DID LIGHTFOOT
3318-164981-0044 AND AS THE WOMAN'S EYES ROVED OVER THE BRIGHT SCENE SHE GAVE A GREAT GASP OF DELIGHT IT IS OUR HOME SHE CRIED THEY ATE AND SLEPT IN THE LIGHT AND WARMTH OF SURROUNDING FLAMES AND WHEN THE DAY CAME THEY BEGAN THE WORK OF ENLARGING WHAT WAS TO BE THEIR CAVE
3318-164981-0045 BUT THOUGH THEY WORKED EARNESTLY THEY DID NOT CARE SO MUCH FOR THE PROSPECTIVE SHELTER AS THEY MIGHT HAVE DONE WHAT A CAVE HAD GIVEN WAS WARMTH AND SAFETY HERE THEY HAD BOTH OUT OF DOORS AND UNDER THE CLEAR SKY
