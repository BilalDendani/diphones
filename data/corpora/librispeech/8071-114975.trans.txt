8071-114975-0000 THE STOLEN DREAM THE SUN WAS SETTING AND SLANTING LONG LANES OF GOLDEN LIGHT THROUGH THE TREES AS AN OLD MAN
8071-114975-0001 HE WAS VERY OLD
8071-114975-0002 HIS CHEEKS WERE FURROWED LIKE THE BARK OF A TREE AND FAR DOWN UPON HIS BREAST FELL A BEARD AS WHITE AS SNOW BUT HIS DEEP SET EYES WERE STILL BRIGHT AND KEEN THOUGH SLY AND CRUEL
8071-114975-0003 AND HIS LONG NOSE WAS LIKE THE BEAK OF A HAWK HIS HANDS WERE LIKE ROOTS STRONG AND KNOTTED AND HIS FINGERS ENDED IN TALON LIKE NAILS IN REPOSE
8071-114975-0004 HE SEEMED AS ABJECTLY POOR AS HE WAS ABJECTLY OLD PRESENTLY WHEN HE HAD RESTED AWHILE HE TURNED TO HIS PACK AND FURTIVELY GLANCING WITH HIS KEEN EYES UP AND DOWN THE WOOD
8071-114975-0005 TO MAKE SURE THAT HE WAS ALONE HE DREW FROM IT A SACK OF LEATHER WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY OF GREAT WEIGHT ITS MOUTH WAS FASTENED BY SLIDING THONGS WHICH HE LOOSENED WITH TREMULOUS EAGER HANDS
8071-114975-0006 A TORRENT OF GOLD AND SILVER COINS AND PRECIOUS STONES FLASHING LIKE RAINBOWS A KING'S TREASURE THE SETTING SUN FLASHED ON THE GLITTERING HEAP TURNING IT INTO A DAZZLE OF MANY COLORED FIRE
8071-114975-0007 THE TREASURE SEEMED TO LIGHT UP THE WOOD FAR AND NEAR AND THE GAUDY SUMMER FLOWERS THAT A MOMENT BEFORE HAD SEEMED SO BRIGHT AND SPLENDID FELL INTO SHADOW BEFORE ITS RADIANCE THE OLD MAN
8071-114975-0008 IT GROWS HEAVIER AND HEAVIER HE MUTTERED I CANNOT CARRY IT MUCH LONGER I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO CARRY IT WITH ME TO THE GRAVE AS HE DISAPPEARED AMONG THE BUSHES
8071-114975-0009 A YOUNG MAN AND A YOUNG WOMAN WITH ARMS TWINED ROUND EACH OTHER CAME SLOWLY UP THE GLADE AND PRESENTLY SAT DOWN AT THE FOOT OF THE TREE WHERE THE OLD MAN HAD BEEN RESTING A MOMENT OR TWO BEFORE
8071-114975-0010 TOGETHER IT WILL BUY YOU A NEW SILK GOWN SAID THE LOVER WHO EVER HEARD OF SUCH LUCK AND THEN HE SIGHED AH DEAR HEART HE SAID IF ONLY WE HAD MORE LIKE THAT THEN WE COULD FULFIL OUR DREAM
8071-114975-0011 BUT THE WHITE FEET OF THE GIRL SHONE LIKE IVORY FLOWERS IN THE GRASS AND HER HAIR WAS A SHEAF OF RUDDY GOLD NOR WAS THERE A JEWEL IN ALL THE OLD MAN'S TREASURE AS BLUE AS HER EYES AND THE YOUNG MAN
8071-114975-0012 IN HIS MANLY FASHION WAS NO LESS BRAVE AND FAIR TO LOOK UPON IN A LITTLE WHILE THEY TURNED TO A POOR WALLET AT THE YOUNG MAN'S SIDE LET US EAT OUR SUPPER THEY SAID
8071-114975-0013 BUT THERE WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A CRUST OR TWO A FEW MORSELS OF CHEESE AND A MOUTHFUL OR TWO OF SOUR WINE STILL THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO BEING HUNGRY AND THE THOUGHT OF THE GOLD COIN CHEERED THEIR HEARTS
8071-114975-0014 AFTER THE LOVERS HAD BEEN SILENT FOR A LONG TIME HE TOOK COURAGE TO PEER OUT FROM HIS HIDING PLACE
8071-114975-0015 HE WOULD WAIT A LITTLE LONGER THOUGH TILL THEIR SLEEP WAS SOUNDER AND THEN HE MIGHT BE ABLE PERHAPS TO CREEP AWAY UNHEARD SO HE WAITED ON AND THE MOON GREW BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER AND FLOODED THE WOODS WITH ITS STRANGE SILVER
8071-114975-0016 SOMETHING VERY STRANGE AND BEAUTIFUL HOVERING OVER THE SLEEPING LOVERS WAS A FLOATING FLICKERING SHAPE THAT SEEMED MADE OF MOONBEAMS WITH TWO GREAT SHINING STARS FOR ITS EYES
8071-114975-0017 IT WAS THE DREAM THAT CAME NIGHTLY TO WATCH OVER THE SLEEP OF THE LOVERS
8071-114975-0018 A STRANGE CHANGE CAME OVER HIS SOUL AND HE SAW THAT ALL THE TREASURE HE HAD HOARDED SO LONG
8071-114975-0019 AFTER ALL IS IT TO ME BUT A WEARY BURDEN MY SHOULDERS GROW TOO OLD TO CARRY HE MURMURED AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH MY LIFE IS IN DANGER WHEREVER I GO AND TO GUARD WHICH I MUST HIDE AWAY FROM THE EYES OF MEN
8071-114975-0020 AND THE LONGER HE GAZED ON THE FAIR SHINING VISION THE MORE THE LONGING GREW WITHIN HIM TO POSSESS IT FOR HIMSELF THEY SHALL HAVE MY TREASURE IN EXCHANGE HE SAID TO HIMSELF APPROACHING NEARER TO THE SLEEPERS
8071-114975-0021 TREADING SOFTLY LEST HE SHOULD AWAKEN THEM BUT THEY SLEPT ON LOST IN THE PROFOUND SLUMBER OF INNOCENT YOUTH AS HE DREW NEAR THE DREAM SHRANK FROM HIM WITH FEAR IN ITS STARRY EYES
8071-114975-0022 BUT IT SEEMED THE MORE BEAUTIFUL TO THE OLD MAN THE CLOSER HE CAME TO IT AND SAW OF WHAT DIVINE RADIANCE IT WAS MADE AND WITH HIS DESIRE HIS CONFIDENCE GREW GREATER SO
8071-114975-0023 SOFTLY PLACING HIS LEATHER BAG IN THE FLOWERS BY THE SIDE OF THE SLEEPERS HE THRUST OUT HIS TALON LIKE FINGERS AND SNATCHED THE DREAM BY THE HAND
8071-114975-0024 AS THE EARLIEST BIRDS CHIMED THROUGH THE WOOD AND THE DAWN GLITTERED ON THE DEWY FLOWERS
8071-114975-0025 CRIED THE GIRL AND HER HANDS FELL FROM THE PRETTY TASK OF COILING UP THE SUNRISE OF HER HAIR WITH A CRY THEY BOTH FELL UPON THE LEATHER BAG LYING THERE SO MYSTERIOUSLY AMONG THE WOOD LILIES IN THE GRASS
8071-114975-0026 WITH EAGER FINGERS THEY DREW APART THE LEATHER THONGS AND WENT HALF MAD WITH WONDER AND JOY AS THEY POURED OUT THE GLITTERING TREASURE
8071-114975-0027 NOR WAS THE GOLD MERE GOLD OF FAERIE BUT COINS BEARING THE IMAGE OF THE KING OF THE LAND HERE WERE REAL JEWELS REAL GOLD AND SILVER LIKE CHILDREN THEY DABBLED THEIR HANDS IN THE SHINING HEAP
8071-114975-0028 AND SENT THEM DOWN FROM HEAVEN IN THE NIGHT HE WHO SENT THEM WILL SEE THAT WE COME TO NO HARM AND AGAIN THEY FELL TO POURING THEM THROUGH THEIR FINGERS AND BABBLING IN THEIR DELIGHT
8071-114975-0029 IF ONLY WE HAD MORE OF THEM SURELY OUR GOOD ANGEL HEARD US AND SENT THEM IN ANSWER IT IS TRUE SAID THE YOUNG MAN THEY WERE SENT TO FULFIL OUR DREAM
8071-114975-0030 OUR POOR STARVED AND TATTERED DREAM SAID THE GIRL HOW SPLENDIDLY WE CAN CLOTHE AND FEED IT NOW
8071-114975-0031 AND LAWNS LIKE RAINBOWS AND GLITTER WITH JEWELS BLUE AND YELLOW AND RUBY JEWELS LIKE FIRE FOUNTAINS AND THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA BUT AS THEY SPOKE
8071-114975-0032 A SUDDEN DISQUIETUDE FELL OVER THEM AND THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH A NEW FEAR BUT WHERE IS OUR DREAM SAID THE GIRL LOOKING ANXIOUSLY AROUND AND THEY REALIZED
8071-114975-0033 THAT THEIR DREAM WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN I SEEMED TO MISS IT ONCE IN THE NIGHT ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN IN ALARM
8071-114975-0034 BE IT CANNOT BE FAR AWAY SAID THE GIRL PERHAPS IT HAS WANDERED OFF AMONG THE FLOWERS BUT THEY WERE NOW THOROUGHLY ALARMED
8071-114975-0035 TO AND FRO THROUGH THE WOOD CALLING OUT ALOUD ON THEIR DREAM BUT NO VOICE CAME BACK IN REPLY NOR THOUGH THEY SOUGHT HIGH AND LOW IN COVERT AND BRAKE COULD THEY FIND A SIGN OF IT ANYWHERE
8071-114975-0036 FORGETTING IT ALL IN THIS NEW SORROW WHAT SHALL WE DO
8071-114975-0037 FOR A WHILE THEY SAT ON INCONSOLABLE THEN A THOUGHT CAME TO THE GIRL SOME ONE MUST HAVE STOLEN IT FROM US IT WOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT US OF ITS OWN ACCORD SAID SHE
8071-114975-0038 AND MAYBE WE CAN BUY IT BACK AGAIN WITH THIS TREASURE LET US START AT ONCE SAID THE GIRL DRYING HER TEARS AT THIS RAY OF HOPE AND SO REPLACING THE TREASURE IN THE BAG THE YOUNG MAN SLUNG IT AT THE END OF HIS STAFF AND TOGETHER
8071-114975-0039 SING TO ME SAID THE OLD MAN TO CHEER MY TIRED HEART
8071-114975-0040 YOU LIE SAID THE OLD MAN I SAW THE SONGS LAST NIGHT IN THE DEPTHS OF YOUR EYES I CANNOT SING THEM TO YOU SAID THE DREAM I CAN ONLY SING THEM TO THE SIMPLE HEARTS I MADE THEM FOR
8071-114975-0041 THE HEARTS YOU STOLE ME FROM
8071-114975-0042 DID I NOT LEAVE MY TREASURE IN EXCHANGE YOUR TREASURE WILL BE NOTHING TO THEM WITHOUT ME SAID THE DREAM
8071-114975-0043 WITH MY TREASURE THEY CAN BUY OTHER DREAMS JUST AS FAIR AS YOU ARE DO YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE THE ONLY DREAM IN THE WORLD THERE IS NO DREAM THAT MONEY CANNOT BUY BUT I AM THEIR OWN DREAM
8071-114975-0044 THEY WILL BE HAPPY WITH NO OTHER SAID THE DREAM YOU SHALL SING TO ME ALL THE SAME SAID THE OLD MAN ANGRILY BUT THE DREAM SHRANK FROM HIM AND COVERED ITS FACE
8071-114975-0045 SING AGAIN CRIED THE OLD MAN HARSHLY SING I BID YOU I CAN NEVER SING AGAIN SAID THE DREAM I CAN ONLY DIE
8071-114975-0046 WHIMPERING THING AND HE RAVED LIKE A MADMAN AS HE SAW IN FANCY ALL THE GOLD AND SILVER AND RAINBOW TINTED JEWELS HE HAD SO FOOLISHLY THROWN AWAY TAKE ME BACK TO THEM SAID THE DREAM AND THEY WILL GIVE YOU BACK YOUR TREASURE
8071-114975-0047 YOU WILL SEE SAID THE DREAM AS THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO BE DONE THE OLD MAN TOOK UP HIS STAFF COME ALONG THEN SAID HE AND STARTED OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE WOOD
8071-114975-0048 AND SO THEY TOOK THEIR WAY BUT MEANWHILE THE TWO LOVERS HAD GONE FROM VILLAGE TO VILLAGE AND CITY TO CITY VAINLY ASKING NEWS OF THEIR DREAM AND TO EVERY ONE THEY ASKED THEY SHOWED THEIR TREASURE AND SAID
8071-114975-0049 BUT NOWHERE COULD THEY LEARN ANY TIDINGS
8071-114975-0050 YOU MUST BE MAD SAID SOME TO SEEK A DREAM WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THAT WEALTH IN YOUR PACK OF WHAT USE IS A DREAM TO ANY ONE AND WHAT MORE DREAM DO YOU WANT THAN GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES
8071-114975-0051 AH OUR DREAM SAID THE LOVERS IS WORTH ALL THE GOLD AND JEWELS IN THE WORLD SOMETIMES OTHERS WOULD COME BRINGING THEIR OWN DREAMS TAKE THIS THEY WOULD SAY AND GIVE US YOUR TREASURE
8071-114975-0052 BUT THE LOVERS WOULD SHAKE THEIR HEADS SADLY NO YOUR DREAMS ARE NOT SO BEAUTIFUL AS OURS
8071-114975-0053 AND INDEED THE DREAMS THAT WERE BROUGHT TO THEM SEEMED POOR PITIFUL MAKE BELIEVE THINGS OFTEN IGNOBLE MISBEGOTTEN SORDID AND CRUEL
8071-114975-0054 AND SAT DOWN ONCE MORE UNDER THE GREAT OAK TREE IN THE SUNSET PERHAPS OUR DREAM HAS BEEN WAITING FOR US HERE ALL THE TIME THEY SAID BUT THE WOOD WAS EMPTY AND ECHOING
8071-114975-0055 AND THEY SAT AND ATE THEIR SUPPER AS BEFORE BUT SILENTLY AND IN SORROW AND AS THE SUN SET THEY FELL ASLEEP AS BEFORE IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS
8071-114975-0056 AND AGAIN THE MOON CAME FLOODING THE SPACES OF THE WOOD AND NOTHING WAS HEARD BUT THEIR BREATHING AND THE SONG OF A DISTANT NIGHTINGALE BUT PRESENTLY WHILE THEY SLEPT THERE WAS A SOUND OF STEALTHY FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE WOOD
8071-114975-0057 BUT THE OLD MAN'S WOLFISH EYES SAW BUT ONE THING THERE LAY THE LEATHER BAG OF HIS TREASURE JUST AS HE HAD LEFT IT WITHOUT A WORD HE SNATCHED IT UP AND HASTENED OFF WITH IT DOWN THE WOOD GURGLING UNCOUTHLY TO HIMSELF
8071-114975-0058 OH MY BEAUTIES HE CRIED AS HE SAT HIMSELF DOWN AFAR OFF AND POURED OUT THE GOLD AND THE SILVER AND THE GLEAMING STONES INTO THE MOONLIGHT OH MY LOVE MY LIFE AND MY DELIGHT
8071-114975-0059 I SEEMED TO HEAR SINGING EACH SAID
