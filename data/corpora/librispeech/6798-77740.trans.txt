6798-77740-0000 THE VILLAGE WAS FULL OF SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS HAD TO PUT UP WITH ALL KINDS OF ILL TREATMENT MOREOVER OUR PEOPLE WERE IN A STATE OF GREAT EXCITEMENT BECAUSE AN ORDER HAD RECENTLY COME FROM THE TURKISH AUTHORITIES BIDDING THEM SURRENDER
6798-77740-0001 WHATEVER FIRE ARMS OR WEAPONS THEY HAD IN THEIR POSSESSION A SINISTER COMMAND THIS WE KNEW THAT SIMILAR MEASURES HAD BEEN TAKEN BEFORE THE TERRIBLE ARMENIAN MASSACRES
6798-77740-0002 AND THEY HAD REFUSED TO GIVE THEM UP A HOUSE TO HOUSE SEARCH HAD BEEN MADE FRUITLESSLY FOR OUR LITTLE ARSENAL WAS SAFELY CACHED IN A FIELD BENEATH GROWING GRAIN IT WAS A TENSE UNPLEASANT SITUATION
6798-77740-0003 AT ANY TIME THE TURKS MIGHT DECIDE TO BACK UP THEIR DEMAND BY SOME OF THE VIOLENT METHODS OF WHICH THEY ARE PAST MASTERS A FAMILY COUNCIL WAS HELD IN MY HOME AND IT WAS DECIDED TO SEND MY SISTER A GIRL OF TWENTY THREE TO SOME FRIENDS
6798-77740-0004 AT THE AMERICAN SYRIAN PROTESTANT COLLEGE
6798-77740-0005 SO THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MOVE FREELY WITHOUT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HAVING A GIRL AT HOME IN A COUNTRY WHERE AS A MATTER OF COURSE THE WOMEN FOLK ARE SEIZED AND CARRIED OFF BEFORE A MASSACRE
6798-77740-0006 WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS AN AMERICAN CONSUL GENERAL WHO KEPT IN CONTINUAL TOUCH WITH THE BATTLESHIP ANCHORED IN THE HARBOR FOR THE PROTECTION OF AMERICAN INTERESTS MY SISTER GOT AWAY NONE TOO SOON ONE EVENING SHORTLY AFTER HER DEPARTURE
6798-77740-0007 WHEN I WAS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OF OUR HOUSE WATCHING THE EVER FRESH MIRACLE OF THE EASTERN SUNSET A TURKISH OFFICER CAME RIDING DOWN THE STREET WITH ABOUT THIRTY CAVALRYMEN HE CALLED ME OUT AND ORDERED ME TO FOLLOW HIM TO THE LITTLE VILLAGE INN WHERE HE DISMOUNTED
6798-77740-0008 AND LED ME TO ONE OF THE INNER ROOMS HIS SPURS JINGLING LOUDLY AS WE PASSED ALONG THE STONE CORRIDOR I NEVER KNEW WHETHER I HAD BEEN SELECTED FOR THIS ATTENTION BECAUSE OF MY PROMINENCE AS A LEADER OF THE JEWISH YOUNG MEN
6798-77740-0009 OR SIMPLY BECAUSE I HAD BEEN STANDING CONVENIENTLY IN THE DOORWAY THE OFFICER CLOSED THE DOOR AND CAME STRAIGHT TO THE POINT BY ASKING ME WHERE OUR STORE OF ARMS WAS HIDDEN HE WAS A BIG FELLOW
6798-77740-0010 WITH THE HANDSOME CRUEL FEATURES USUAL ENOUGH IN HIS CLASS THERE WAS NO OPEN MENACE IN HIS FIRST QUESTION WHEN I REFUSED TO TELL HIM HE BEGAN WHEEDLING AND OFFERING ALL SORTS OF FAVORS IF I WOULD BETRAY MY PEOPLE THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
6798-77740-0011 HE WHIPPED OUT A REVOLVER AND STUCK THE MUZZLE RIGHT IN MY FACE I FELT THE BLOOD LEAVE MY HEART BUT I WAS ABLE TO CONTROL MYSELF AND REFUSE HIS DEMAND
6798-77740-0012 BUT I FELT SURE THAT THIS WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING SURE ENOUGH NEXT MORNING THE SABBATH THE SAME OFFICER RETURNED AND PUT THREE OF THE LEADING ELDERS OF THE VILLAGE TOGETHER WITH MYSELF UNDER ARREST
6798-77740-0013 AFTER ANOTHER FRUITLESS INQUISITION AT THE HOTEL WE WERE HANDCUFFED AND STARTED ON FOOT TOWARD THE PRISON A DAY'S JOURNEY AWAY AS OUR LITTLE PROCESSION PASSED MY HOME
6798-77740-0014 CAME TOTTERING FORWARD TO SAY GOOD BYE TO ME A SOLDIER PUSHED HIM ROUGHLY BACK
6798-77740-0015 THEN FELL FULL LENGTH IN THE STREET BEFORE MY EYES IT WAS A DISMAL DEPARTURE WE WERE DRIVEN THROUGH THE STREETS SHACKLED LIKE CRIMINALS AND THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN CAME OUT OF THE HOUSES AND WATCHED US IN SILENCE
6798-77740-0016 THEIR HEADS BOWED TEARS RUNNING DOWN THEIR CHEEKS THEY REALIZED THAT FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS THESE OLD MEN MY COMRADES HAD BEEN STRUGGLING AND SUFFERING FOR THEIR IDEAL A REGENERATED PALESTINE
6798-77740-0017 NOW IN THE DUSK OF THEIR LIFE IT SEEMED AS IF ALL THEIR HOPES AND DREAMS WERE COMING TO RUIN THE OPPRESSIVE TRAGEDY OF THE SITUATION SETTLED DOWN ON ME MORE AND MORE HEAVILY
6798-77740-0018 AS THE DAY WORE ON AND HEAT AND FATIGUE TOLD ON MY COMPANIONS
6798-77740-0019 THAT WE MUST NOT RELY UPON STRENGTH OF ARMS AND THAT OUR SPIRIT COULD NEVER BE BROKEN NO MATTER HOW DEFENSELESS WE WERE THUS HE AN OLD MAN WAS ENCOURAGING ME INSTEAD OF RECEIVING HELP FROM MY YOUTH AND ENTHUSIASM
6798-77740-0020 AT LAST WE ARRIVED AT THE PRISON
6798-77740-0021 THAT SAME NIGHT WE WERE TORTURED WITH THE FALAGY OR BASTINADO THE VICTIM OF THIS HORRIBLE PUNISHMENT IS TRUSSED UP ARMS AND LEGS AND THROWN ON HIS KNEES THEN ON THE BARE SOLES OF HIS FEET A PLIANT GREEN ROD IS BROUGHT DOWN WITH
6798-77740-0022 BLOOD LEAPS OUT AT THE FIRST CUT AND STRONG MEN USUALLY FAINT AFTER THIRTY OR FORTY STROKES STRANGE TO SAY THE WORST PART OF IT IS NOT THE BLOW ITSELF BUT THE WHISTLING OF THE ROD THROUGH THE AIR AS IT RUSHES TO ITS MARK
6798-77740-0023 THE GROANS OF MY OLDER COMRADES WHOSE GASPS AND PRAYERS I COULD HEAR THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE CELL HELPED ME BEAR THE AGONY UNTIL UNCONSCIOUSNESS MERCIFULLY CAME TO THE RESCUE FOR SEVERAL DAYS MORE WE WERE KEPT IN THE PRISON
6798-77740-0024 SICK AND BROKEN WITH SUFFERING THE SECOND NIGHT AS I LAY SLEEPLESS AND DESPERATE ON THE STRIP OF DIRTY MATTING THAT SERVED AS BED I HEARD A SCRATCH SCRATCHING AT THE GRATED SLIT OF A WINDOW AND PRESENTLY A SLENDER STICK WAS INSERTED INTO THE CELL
6798-77740-0025 SOME ONE AT THE OTHER END WAS HOLDING IT FIRM AND THEN A CURIOUS WHISPERING SOUND BEGAN TO COME FROM THE END OF THE STICK I PUT MY EAR DOWN AND CAUGHT THE VOICE OF ONE OF THE MEN FROM OUR VILLAGE HE HAD TAKEN A LONG BAMBOO POLE
6798-77740-0026 PIERCED THE JOINTS AND CREPT UP BEHIND A BROKEN OLD WALL CLOSE BENEATH MY WINDOW BY MEANS OF THIS PRIMITIVE TELEPHONE WE TALKED AS LONG AS WE DARED I ASSURED HIM THAT WE WERE STILL ENDURING AND
6798-77740-0027 URGED HIM ON NO ACCOUNT TO GIVE UP THE ARMS TO THE TURKISH AUTHORITIES NOT EVEN IF WE HAD TO MAKE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE FINALLY WHEN IT WAS FOUND THAT TORTURE AND IMPRISONMENT WOULD NOT MAKE US YIELD OUR SECRET
6798-77740-0028 THE TURKS RESORTED TO THE FINAL TEST THE ORDEAL WHICH WE COULD NOT WITHSTAND
6798-77740-0029 A NUMBER OF OUR YOUNG GIRLS WOULD BE CARRIED OFF AND HANDED OVER TO THE OFFICERS TO BE KEPT UNTIL THE ARMS WERE DISCLOSED WE KNEW THAT THEY WERE CAPABLE OF CARRYING OUT THIS THREAT WE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANT THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE
6798-77740-0030 I HAD OFTEN WONDERED HOW OUR PEOPLE HAD BEEN ABLE TO BEAR THE RACK AND THUMBSCREW OF THE SPANISH INQUISITION BUT WHEN MY TURN AND MY COMRADES CAME FOR TORTURE I REALIZED THAT THE SAME SPIRIT THAT HELPED OUR ANCESTORS WAS WORKING IN US ALSO
6798-77740-0031 NOW I KNEW THAT OUR SUFFERING HAD BEEN USELESS WHENEVER THE TURKISH AUTHORITIES WISHED THE HORRORS OF THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES WOULD LIVE AGAIN IN ZICRON JACOB AND WE SHOULD BE POWERLESS TO RAISE A HAND TO PROTECT OURSELVES
6798-77740-0032 AS WE CAME LIMPING HOME THROUGH THE STREETS OF OUR VILLAGE I CAUGHT SIGHT OF MY OWN SMITH AND WESSON REVOLVER IN THE HANDS OF A MERE BOY OF FIFTEEN THE SON OF A WELL KNOWN ARAB OUTLAW
