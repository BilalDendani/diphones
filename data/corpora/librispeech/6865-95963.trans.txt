6865-95963-0000 IN HIS HOURS OF RECREATION AND REFRESHMENT THE MASTER'S MANNER WAS EASY AND UNCONSTRAINED AFFABLE AND WINNING ONCE HE EXCLAIMED ALAS I MUST BE GETTING VERY FEEBLE
6865-95963-0001 TIS LONG SINCE I HAVE HAD A REPETITION OF THE DREAMS IN WHICH I USED TO SEE THE DUKE OF CHOW
6865-95963-0002 UPON THE GOOD WAY MAINTAIN FIRM HOLD UPON VIRTUE RELY UPON PHILANTHROPY FIND RECREATION IN THE ARTS
6865-95963-0003 I HAVE NEVER WITHHELD INSTRUCTION FROM ANY EVEN FROM THOSE WHO HAVE COME FOR IT WITH THE SMALLEST OFFERING NO SUBJECT DO I BROACH HOWEVER TO THOSE WHO HAVE NO EAGER DESIRE TO LEARN
6865-95963-0004 NO ENCOURAGING HINT DO I GIVE TO THOSE WHO SHOW NO ANXIETY TO SPEAK OUT THEIR IDEAS NOR HAVE I ANYTHING MORE TO SAY TO THOSE WHO AFTER I HAVE MADE CLEAR ONE CORNER OF THE SUBJECT CANNOT FROM THAT GIVE ME THE OTHER THREE
6865-95963-0005 IF THE MASTER WAS TAKING A MEAL AND THERE WERE ANY IN MOURNING BESIDE HIM HE WOULD NOT EAT TO THE FULL ON ONE DAY ON WHICH HE HAD WEPT ON THAT DAY HE WOULD NOT SING
6865-95963-0006 ADDRESSING HIS FAVORITE DISCIPLE HE SAID TO YOU ONLY AND MYSELF IT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO DO THIS TO GO WHEN CALLED TO SERVE AND TO GO BACK INTO QUIET RETIREMENT WHEN RELEASED FROM OFFICE
6865-95963-0007 HEARING THE REMARK SAID BUT IF SIR
6865-95963-0008 THE MASTER ANSWERED NOT THE ONE WHO'LL ROUSE THE TIGER NOT THE ONE WHO'LL WADE THE HO NOT THE MAN WHO CAN DIE WITH NO REGRET HE MUST BE ONE WHO SHOULD WATCH OVER AFFAIRS WITH APPREHENSIVE CAUTION A MAN FOND OF STRATEGY
6865-95963-0009 AND OF PERFECT SKILL AND EFFECTIVENESS IN IT
6865-95963-0010 IF WEALTH WERE AN OBJECT THAT I COULD GO IN QUEST OF I SHOULD DO SO EVEN IF I HAD TO TAKE A WHIP AND DO GROOMS WORK BUT SEEING THAT IT IS NOT I GO AFTER THOSE OBJECTS FOR WHICH I HAVE A LIKING
6865-95963-0011 AMONG MATTERS OVER WHICH HE EXERCISED GREAT CAUTION WERE TIMES OF FASTING WAR AND SICKNESS WHEN HE WAS IN THE STATE OF TS'I AND HAD HEARD THE ANCIENT SHAU MUSIC
6865-95963-0012 HE LOST ALL PERCEPTION OF THE TASTE OF HIS MEAT I HAD NO IDEA SAID HE THAT MUSIC COULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO THIS PITCH
6865-95963-0013 DOES THE MASTER TAKE THE PART OF THE PRINCE OF WEI
6865-95963-0014 I WILL GO AND ASK HIM THAT ON GOING IN TO HIM THAT DISCIPLE BEGAN
6865-95963-0015 HAD THEY ANY FEELINGS OF RESENTMENT WAS THE NEXT QUESTION THEIR AIM AND OBJECT HE ANSWERED WAS THAT OF DOING THE DUTY WHICH EVERY MAN OWES TO HIS FELLOWS AND THEY SUCCEEDED IN DOING IT WHAT ROOM FURTHER FOR FEELINGS OF RESENTMENT
6865-95963-0016 THE QUESTIONER ON COMING OUT SAID THE MASTER DOES NOT TAKE HIS PART
6865-95963-0017 AND WITH WATER TO DRINK AND MY BENT ARM FOR MY PILLOW EVEN THUS I CAN FIND HAPPINESS RICHES AND HONORS WITHOUT RIGHTEOUSNESS ARE TO ME AS FLEETING CLOUDS GIVE ME SEVERAL YEARS MORE TO LIVE SAID HE
6865-95963-0018 I MIGHT COME TO BE FREE FROM SERIOUS ERROR THE MASTER'S REGULAR SUBJECTS OF DISCOURSE WERE THE BOOKS OF THE ODES AND HISTORY AND THE UP KEEPING OF THE RULES OF PROPRIETY ON ALL OF THESE HE REGULARLY DISCOURSED
6865-95963-0019 HEARING OF THIS THE MASTER SAID WHY DID YOU NOT SAY HE IS A MAN WITH A MIND SO INTENT ON HIS PURSUITS THAT HE FORGETS HIS FOOD AND FINDS SUCH PLEASURE IN THEM THAT HE FORGETS HIS TROUBLES AND DOES NOT KNOW THAT OLD AGE IS COMING UPON HIM
6865-95963-0020 DEEDS OF LAWLESSNESS REFERENCES TO SPIRITUAL BEINGS SUCH LIKE MATTERS THE MASTER AVOIDED IN CONVERSATION LET THERE HE SAID BE THREE MEN WALKING TOGETHER
6865-95963-0021 FROM THAT NUMBER I SHOULD BE SURE TO FIND MY INSTRUCTORS FOR WHAT IS GOOD IN THEM I SHOULD CHOOSE OUT AND FOLLOW AND WHAT IS NOT GOOD I SHOULD MODIFY ON ONE OCCASION HE EXCLAIMED HEAVEN BEGAT VIRTUE IN ME
6865-95963-0022 WHAT CAN MAN DO UNTO ME TO HIS DISCIPLES HE ONCE SAID DO YOU LOOK UPON ME MY SONS AS KEEPING ANYTHING SECRET FROM YOU I HIDE NOTHING FROM YOU I DO NOTHING THAT IS NOT MANIFEST TO YOUR EYES
6865-95963-0023 MY DISCIPLES THAT IS SO WITH ME FOUR THINGS THERE WERE WHICH HE KEPT IN VIEW IN HIS TEACHING SCHOLARLINESS CONDUCT OF LIFE HONESTY FAITHFULNESS
6865-95963-0024 IT IS NOT GIVEN TO ME HE SAID TO MEET WITH A SAGE LET ME BUT BEHOLD A MAN OF SUPERIOR MIND AND THAT WILL SUFFICE NEITHER IS IT GIVEN TO ME TO MEET WITH A GOOD MAN LET ME BUT SEE A MAN OF CONSTANCY
6865-95963-0025 AND IT WILL SUFFICE IT IS DIFFICULT FOR PERSONS TO HAVE CONSTANCY WHEN THEY PRETEND TO HAVE THAT WHICH THEY ARE DESTITUTE OF TO BE FULL WHEN THEY ARE EMPTY
6865-95963-0026 WHEN THE MASTER FISHED WITH HOOK AND LINE HE DID NOT ALSO USE A NET WHEN OUT WITH HIS BOW HE WOULD NEVER SHOOT AT GAME IN COVER SOME THERE MAY BE SAID HE WHO DO THINGS IN IGNORANCE OF WHAT THEY DO
6865-95963-0027 I AM NOT OF THESE THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE WAY OF KNOWING THINGS VIZ TO SIFT OUT THE GOOD FROM THE MANY THINGS ONE HEARS AND FOLLOW IT AND TO KEEP IN MEMORY THE MANY THINGS ONE SEES
6865-95963-0028 ONE YOUTH CAME TO INTERVIEW THE MASTER
6865-95963-0029 WHY SO MUCH ADO SAID THE MASTER AT MY MERELY PERMITTING HIS APPROACH AND NOT RATHER AT MY ALLOWING HIM TO DRAW BACK IF A MAN HAVE CLEANSED HIMSELF IN ORDER TO COME AND SEE ME I RECEIVE HIM AS SUCH
6865-95963-0030 BUT I DO NOT UNDERTAKE FOR WHAT HE WILL DO WHEN HE GOES AWAY IS THE PHILANTHROPIC SPIRIT FAR TO SEEK INDEED THE MASTER EXCLAIMED I WISH FOR IT AND IT IS WITH ME
6865-95963-0031 THE MINISTER OF CRIME IN THE STATE OF CH'IN ASKED CONFUCIUS
6865-95963-0032 AND HE ANSWERED YES HE KNOWS THEM WHEN CONFUCIUS HAD WITHDRAWN
6865-95963-0033 AND MOTIONED TO HIM TO COME FORWARD HE SAID I HAVE HEARD THAT SUPERIOR MEN SHOW NO PARTIALITY ARE THEY TOO THEN PARTIAL THAT PRINCE TOOK FOR HIS WIFE A LADY OF THE WU FAMILY
6865-95963-0034 THE ELDER IF HE KNOWS THE PROPRIETIES THEN WHO DOES NOT THE DISCIPLE REPORTED THIS TO THE MASTER WHO THEREUPON REMARKED
6865-95963-0035 OTHERS ARE SURE TO KNOW OF IT WHEN THE MASTER WAS IN COMPANY WITH ANY ONE WHO SANG AND WHO SANG WELL HE MUST NEEDS HAVE THE SONG OVER AGAIN AND AFTER THAT WOULD JOIN IN IT
6865-95963-0036 ALTHOUGH IN LETTERS HE SAID I MAY HAVE NONE TO COMPARE WITH ME YET IN MY PERSONIFICATION OF THE SUPERIOR MAN I HAVE NOT AS YET BEEN SUCCESSFUL A SAGE AND A PHILANTHROPIST
6865-95963-0037 HOW SHOULD I HAVE THE AMBITION SAID HE ALL THAT I CAN WELL BE CALLED IS THIS AN INSATIABLE STUDENT AN UNWEARIED TEACHER THIS AND NO MORE
6865-95963-0038 ONCE WHEN THE MASTER WAS SERIOUSLY ILL TSZ LU REQUESTED TO BE ALLOWED TO SAY PRAYERS FOR HIM ARE SUCH AVAILABLE ASKED THE MASTER YES SAID HE
6865-95963-0039 PRAY TO THE SPIRITS ABOVE AND TO THOSE HERE BELOW MY PRAYING HAS BEEN GOING ON A LONG WHILE SAID THE MASTER LAVISH LIVING HE SAID RENDERS MEN DISORDERLY
6865-95963-0040 MISERLINESS MAKES THEM HARD BETTER HOWEVER THE HARD THAN THE DISORDERLY AGAIN THE MAN OF SUPERIOR MIND IS PLACIDLY COMPOSED THE SMALL MINDED MAN IS IN A CONSTANT STATE OF PERTURBATION
