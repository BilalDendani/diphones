6727-10344-0000 WE MUST CONSIDER NEXT THE WORK OF DISTINCTION IN ITSELF FIRST THE WORK OF THE FIRST DAY SECONDLY THE WORK OF THE SECOND DAY THIRDLY THE WORK OF THE THIRD DAY UNDER THE FIRST HEAD THERE ARE FOUR POINTS OF INQUIRY ONE
6727-10344-0001 WHETHER THE WORD LIGHT IS USED IN ITS PROPER SENSE IN SPEAKING OF SPIRITUAL THINGS TWO WHETHER LIGHT IN CORPOREAL THINGS IS ITSELF CORPOREAL THREE WHETHER LIGHT IS A QUALITY FOUR
6727-10344-0002 WHETHER LIGHT WAS FITTINGLY MADE ON THE FIRST DAY FIRST ARTICLE
6727-10344-0003 WHETHER THE WORD LIGHT IS USED IN ITS PROPER SENSE IN SPEAKING OF SPIRITUAL THINGS OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT LIGHT IS USED IN ITS PROPER SENSE IN SPIRITUAL THINGS FOR AUGUSTINE SAYS
6727-10344-0004 AND THAT CHRIST IS NOT CALLED LIGHT IN THE SAME SENSE AS HE IS CALLED THE STONE THE FORMER IS TO BE TAKEN LITERALLY AND THE LATTER METAPHORICALLY
6727-10344-0005 FURTHER DIONYSIUS
6727-10344-0006 BUT SUCH NAMES ARE USED IN THEIR PROPER SENSE IN SPIRITUAL THINGS THEREFORE LIGHT IS USED IN ITS PROPER SENSE IN SPIRITUAL MATTERS
6727-10344-0007 FURTHER THE APOSTLE SAYS
6727-10344-0008 ALL THAT IS MADE MANIFEST IS LIGHT
6727-10344-0009 BUT TO BE MADE MANIFEST BELONGS MORE PROPERLY TO SPIRITUAL THINGS THAN TO CORPOREAL THEREFORE ALSO DOES LIGHT ON THE CONTRARY AMBROSE SAYS
6727-10344-0010 IS AMONG THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE SAID OF GOD METAPHORICALLY I ANSWER THAT ANY WORD MAY BE USED IN TWO WAYS THAT IS TO SAY EITHER IN ITS ORIGINAL APPLICATION OR IN ITS MORE EXTENDED MEANING
6727-10344-0011 THIS IS CLEARLY SHOWN IN THE WORD SIGHT ORIGINALLY APPLIED TO THE ACT OF THE SENSE AND THEN AS SIGHT IS THE NOBLEST AND MOST TRUSTWORTHY OF THE SENSES EXTENDED IN COMMON SPEECH TO ALL KNOWLEDGE OBTAINED THROUGH THE OTHER SENSES
6727-10344-0012 OR SMELLS OR BURNS FURTHER SIGHT IS APPLIED TO KNOWLEDGE OBTAINED THROUGH THE INTELLECT
6727-10344-0013 EIGHT AND THUS IT IS WITH THE WORD LIGHT IN ITS PRIMARY MEANING IT SIGNIFIES THAT WHICH MAKES MANIFEST TO THE SENSE OF SIGHT AFTERWARDS IT WAS EXTENDED TO THAT WHICH MAKES MANIFEST TO COGNITION OF ANY KIND
6727-10344-0014 IF THEN THE WORD IS TAKEN IN ITS STRICT AND PRIMARY MEANING IT IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD METAPHORICALLY WHEN APPLIED TO SPIRITUAL THINGS AS AMBROSE SAYS
6727-10344-0015 AS APPLIED TO MANIFESTATION OF EVERY KIND IT MAY PROPERLY BE APPLIED TO SPIRITUAL THINGS THE ANSWER TO THE OBJECTIONS WILL SUFFICIENTLY APPEAR FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID SECOND ARTICLE
6727-10344-0016 WHETHER LIGHT IS A BODY OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT LIGHT IS A BODY
6727-10344-0017 FURTHER THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
6727-10344-0018 BUT FIRE IS A BODY AND THEREFORE SO IS LIGHT
6727-10344-0019 FURTHER THE POWERS OF MOVEMENT INTERSECTION REFLECTION BELONG PROPERLY TO BODIES AND ALL THESE ARE ATTRIBUTES OF LIGHT AND ITS RAYS MOREOVER DIFFERENT RAYS OF LIGHT AS DIONYSIUS SAYS
6727-10344-0020 WHICH SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE UNLESS THEY ARE BODIES THEREFORE LIGHT IS A BODY ON THE CONTRARY TWO BODIES CANNOT OCCUPY THE SAME PLACE SIMULTANEOUSLY BUT THIS IS THE CASE WITH LIGHT AND AIR THEREFORE LIGHT IS NOT A BODY
6727-10344-0021 I ANSWER THAT LIGHT CANNOT BE A BODY FOR THREE EVIDENT REASONS FIRST ON THE PART OF PLACE FOR THE PLACE OF ANY ONE BODY IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER NOR IS IT POSSIBLE NATURALLY SPEAKING
6727-10344-0022 FOR ANY TWO BODIES OF WHATEVER NATURE TO EXIST SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THE SAME PLACE SINCE CONTIGUITY REQUIRES DISTINCTION OF PLACE THE SECOND REASON IS FROM MOVEMENT
6727-10344-0023 FOR IF LIGHT WERE A BODY ITS DIFFUSION WOULD BE THE LOCAL MOVEMENT OF A BODY NOW NO LOCAL MOVEMENT OF A BODY CAN BE INSTANTANEOUS AS EVERYTHING THAT MOVES FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER
6727-10344-0024 MUST PASS THROUGH THE INTERVENING SPACE BEFORE REACHING THE END WHEREAS THE DIFFUSION OF LIGHT IS INSTANTANEOUS NOR CAN IT BE ARGUED THAT THE TIME REQUIRED IS TOO SHORT TO BE PERCEIVED
6727-10344-0025 FOR THOUGH THIS MAY BE THE CASE IN SHORT DISTANCES IT CANNOT BE SO IN DISTANCES SO GREAT AS THAT WHICH SEPARATES THE EAST FROM THE WEST YET AS SOON AS THE SUN IS AT THE HORIZON
6727-10344-0026 THE WHOLE HEMISPHERE IS ILLUMINATED FROM END TO END IT MUST ALSO BE BORNE IN MIND ON THE PART OF MOVEMENT THAT WHEREAS ALL BODIES HAVE THEIR NATURAL DETERMINATE MOVEMENT
6727-10344-0027 THAT OF LIGHT IS INDIFFERENT AS REGARDS DIRECTION WORKING EQUALLY IN A CIRCLE AS IN A STRAIGHT LINE HENCE IT APPEARS THAT THE DIFFUSION OF LIGHT IS NOT THE LOCAL MOVEMENT OF A BODY
6727-10344-0028 THE THIRD REASON IS FROM GENERATION AND CORRUPTION FOR IF LIGHT WERE A BODY IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT WHENEVER THE AIR IS DARKENED BY THE ABSENCE OF THE LUMINARY THE BODY OF LIGHT WOULD BE CORRUPTED
6727-10344-0029 AND ITS MATTER WOULD RECEIVE A NEW FORM BUT UNLESS WE ARE TO SAY THAT DARKNESS IS A BODY THIS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE THE CASE NEITHER DOES IT APPEAR FROM WHAT MATTER A BODY CAN BE DAILY GENERATED LARGE ENOUGH
6727-10344-0030 TO FILL THE INTERVENING HEMISPHERE ALSO IT WOULD BE ABSURD TO SAY THAT A BODY OF SO GREAT A BULK IS CORRUPTED BY THE MERE ABSENCE OF THE LUMINARY AND SHOULD ANYONE REPLY
6727-10344-0031 WE MAY ASK WHY IT IS THAT WHEN A LIGHTED CANDLE IS OBSCURED BY THE INTERVENING OBJECT THE WHOLE ROOM IS DARKENED IT IS NOT THAT THE LIGHT IS CONDENSED ROUND THE CANDLE WHEN THIS IS DONE
6727-10344-0032 SINCE IT BURNS NO MORE BRIGHTLY THEN THAN IT BURNED BEFORE SINCE THEREFORE THESE THINGS ARE REPUGNANT NOT ONLY TO REASON BUT TO COMMON SENSE WE MUST CONCLUDE THAT LIGHT CANNOT BE A BODY
6727-10344-0033 AUGUSTINE TAKES LIGHT TO BE A LUMINOUS BODY IN ACT IN OTHER WORDS TO BE FIRE THE NOBLEST OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS
6727-10344-0034 ARISTOTLE PRONOUNCES LIGHT TO BE FIRE EXISTING IN ITS OWN PROPER MATTER JUST AS FIRE IN AERIAL MATTER IS FLAME OR IN EARTHLY MATTER IS BURNING COAL
6727-10344-0035 NOR MUST TOO MUCH ATTENTION BE PAID TO THE INSTANCES ADDUCED BY ARISTOTLE IN HIS WORKS ON LOGIC AS HE MERELY MENTIONS THEM AS THE MORE OR LESS PROBABLE OPINIONS OF VARIOUS WRITERS
6727-10344-0036 ALL THESE PROPERTIES ARE ASSIGNED TO LIGHT METAPHORICALLY AND MIGHT IN THE SAME WAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO HEAT FOR BECAUSE MOVEMENT FROM PLACE TO PLACE IS NATURALLY FIRST IN THE ORDER OF MOVEMENT
6727-10344-0037 WE USE TERMS BELONGING TO LOCAL MOVEMENT IN SPEAKING OF ALTERATION AND MOVEMENT OF ALL KINDS FOR EVEN THE WORD DISTANCE IS DERIVED FROM THE IDEA OF REMOTENESS OF PLACE TO THAT OF ALL CONTRARIES
6727-10344-0038 TEXT THIRTEEN THIRD ARTICLE
6727-10344-0039 WHETHER LIGHT IS A QUALITY OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT LIGHT IS NOT A QUALITY FOR EVERY QUALITY REMAINS IN ITS SUBJECT THOUGH THE ACTIVE CAUSE OF THE QUALITY BE REMOVED AS HEAT REMAINS IN WATER REMOVED FROM THE FIRE
6727-10344-0040 BUT LIGHT DOES NOT REMAIN IN THE AIR WHEN THE SOURCE OF LIGHT IS WITHDRAWN THEREFORE LIGHT IS NOT A QUALITY
6727-10344-0041 FURTHER EVERY SENSIBLE QUALITY HAS ITS OPPOSITE AS COLD IS OPPOSED TO HEAT BLACKNESS TO WHITENESS BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH LIGHT SINCE DARKNESS IS MERELY A PRIVATION OF LIGHT
6727-10344-0042 LIGHT THEREFORE IS NOT A SENSIBLE QUALITY
6727-10344-0043 FURTHER A CAUSE IS MORE POTENT THAN ITS EFFECT BUT THE LIGHT OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES IS A CAUSE OF SUBSTANTIAL FORMS OF EARTHLY BODIES AND ALSO GIVES TO COLORS THEIR IMMATERIAL BEING
6727-10344-0044 BY MAKING THEM ACTUALLY VISIBLE LIGHT THEN IS NOT A SENSIBLE QUALITY BUT RATHER A SUBSTANTIAL OR SPIRITUAL FORM ON THE CONTRARY
6727-10344-0045 SAYS THAT LIGHT IS A SPECIES OF QUALITY I ANSWER THAT SOME WRITERS HAVE SAID THAT THE LIGHT IN THE AIR HAS NOT A NATURAL BEING SUCH AS THE COLOR ON A WALL HAS BUT ONLY AN INTENTIONAL BEING
6727-10344-0046 AS A SIMILITUDE OF COLOR IN THE AIR BUT THIS CANNOT BE THE CASE FOR TWO REASONS FIRST BECAUSE LIGHT GIVES A NAME TO THE AIR SINCE BY IT THE AIR BECOMES ACTUALLY LUMINOUS BUT COLOR DOES NOT DO THIS
6727-10344-0047 FOR WE DO NOT SPEAK OF THE AIR AS COLORED SECONDLY BECAUSE LIGHT PRODUCES NATURAL EFFECTS FOR BY THE RAYS OF THE SUN BODIES ARE WARMED
6727-10344-0048 AND NATURAL CHANGES CANNOT BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY MERE INTENTIONS OTHERS HAVE SAID THAT LIGHT IS THE SUN'S SUBSTANTIAL FORM BUT THIS ALSO SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE FOR TWO REASONS FIRST BECAUSE SUBSTANTIAL FORMS ARE NOT OF THEMSELVES OBJECTS OF THE SENSES
