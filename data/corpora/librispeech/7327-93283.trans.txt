7327-93283-0000 ANDY GIVES THE CLUE WHEN MISTER SWIFT FOLLOWED THE CHIEF OF POLICE AND THE CONSTABLE TO THE TOWN HALL HIS MIND WAS FILLED WITH MANY THOUGHTS ALL HIS PLANS FOR REVOLUTIONIZING SUBMARINE TRAVEL WERE OF COURSE FORGOTTEN AND HE WAS ONLY CONCERNED WITH THE CHARGE THAT HAD BEEN MADE AGAINST HIS SON
7327-93283-0001 IT SEEMED INCREDIBLE YET THE OFFICERS WERE NOT ONES TO PERPETRATE A JOKE THE CHIEF AND CONSTABLE HAD DRIVEN FROM TOWN IN A CARRIAGE AND THEY NOW INVITED THE INVENTOR TO RIDE BACK WITH THEM DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME A WARRANT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN SWORN OUT AGAINST MY SON CHIEF
7327-93283-0002 ASKED THE FATHER WHEN THEY WERE NEAR THE TOWN HALL THAT'S JUST WHAT I MEAN TO SAY MISTER SWIFT AND I'M SORRY ON YOUR ACCOUNT THAT I HAVE TO SERVE IT HUB DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU WAS GOIN TO SERVE IT REMARKED THE CONSTABLE HE'S SKIPPED OUT
7327-93283-0003 THAT'S ALL RIGHT HIGBY WENT ON THE CHIEF I'LL CATCH EM BOTH EVEN IF THEY HAVE ESCAPED IN AN AIRSHIP WITH THEIR BOOTY I'LL NAB EM I'LL HAVE A GENERAL ALARM OUT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IN LESS THAN AN HOUR THEY CAN'T STAY UP IN THE AIR FOREVER
7327-93283-0004 A WARRANT FOR TOM MY SON MURMURED MISTER SWIFT AS IF HE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT YES AND FOR THAT DAMON MAN TOO ADDED THE CHIEF I WANT HIM AS WELL AS TOM AND I'LL GET EM WOULD YOU MIND LETTING ME SEE THE WARRANTS ASKED THE INVENTOR
7327-93283-0005 AND THE OFFICIAL PASSED THEM OVER THE DOCUMENTS WERE MADE OUT IN REGULAR FORM AND THE COMPLAINTS HAD BEEN SWORN TO BY ISAAC PENDERGAST THE BANK PRESIDENT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT WENT ON TOM'S FATHER SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IT'S INCREDIBLE
7327-93283-0006 WHY HE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED IT CAN'T BE TRUE JUST BEFORE HE LEFT MISTER DAMON YES WHAT DID HE DO ASKED THE CHIEF EAGERLY THINKING HE MIGHT SECURE SOME VALUABLE EVIDENCE I GUESS I'LL SAY NOTHING UNTIL I HAVE SEEN THE BANK PRESIDENT REPLIED MISTER SWIFT
7327-93283-0007 THE FINANCIERS WERE RATHER ANGRY WHEN THEY LEARNED THAT THE ACCUSED PERSONS HAD NOT BEEN CAUGHT BUT THE CHIEF SAID HE WOULD SOON HAVE THEM IN CUSTODY IN THE MEANWHILE WILL YOU KINDLY EXPLAIN WHAT THIS MEANS ASKED MISTER SWIFT OF THE PRESIDENT
7327-93283-0008 YOU MAY COME AND LOOK AT THE LOOTED VAULT IF YOU LIKE MISTER SWIFT REPLIED MISTER PENDERGAST IT WAS A VERY THOROUGH JOB AND WILL SERIOUSLY CRIPPLE THE BANK THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT THE VAULT HAD BEEN FORCED OPEN FOR THE LOCKS AND BARS WERE BENT AND TWISTED AS IF BY HEAVY TOOLS
7327-93283-0009 MISTER SWIFT MADE A CAREFUL EXAMINATION AND WAS SHOWN THE MONEY DRAWERS THAT HAD BEEN SMASHED THIS WAS THE WORK OF EXPERTS HE DECLARED EXACTLY WHAT WE THINK SAID THE PRESIDENT OF COURSE WE DON'T BELIEVE YOUR SON WAS A PROFESSIONAL BANK ROBBER MISTER SWIFT
7327-93283-0010 WE HAVE A THEORY THAT MISTER DAMON DID THE REAL WORK BUT THAT TOM HELPED HIM WITH THE TOOLS HE HAD THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO ACCUSE MY SON BURST OUT THE AGED INVENTOR
7327-93283-0011 WHY HAVE YOU ANY MORE CAUSE TO SUSPECT HIM THAN ANY OTHER LAD IN TOWN WHY DO YOU FIX ON HIM AND MISTER DAMON I DEMAND TO KNOW MISTER DAMON'S ECCENTRIC ACTIONS FOR A FEW DAYS PAST AND HIS WELL KNOWN ODDITY OF CHARACTER MAKE HIM AN OBJECT OF SUSPICION
7327-93283-0012 DECLARED THE PRESIDENT IN JUDICIAL TONES AS FOR TOM WE HAVE I REGRET TO SAY EVEN BETTER EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM BUT WHAT IS IT WHAT WHO GAVE YOU ANY CLUES TO POINT TO MY SON DO YOU REALLY WISH TO KNOW I CERTAINLY DO WAS THE SHARP REPLY
7327-93283-0013 MISTER SWIFT THE POLICE AND SEVERAL BANK OFFICIALS WERE NOW IN THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE
7327-93283-0014 SEND YOUNG FOGER HERE AT THE MENTION OF THIS NAME MISTER SWIFT STARTED HE WELL KNEW THE RED HAIRED BULLY WAS AN ENEMY OF HIS SON ANDY ENTERED WALKING RATHER PROUDLY AT THE ATTENTION HE ATTRACTED THIS IS MISTER SWIFT SAID THE PRESIDENT
7327-93283-0015 AW I KNOW HIM BLURTED OUT ANDY YOU WILL PLEASE TELL HIM WHAT YOU TOLD US WENT ON MISTER PENDERGAST WELL I SEEN TOM SWIFT HANGING AROUND THIS BANK WITH BURGLAR TOOLS IN HIS POSSESSION LAST NIGHT JUST BEFORE IT WAS ROBBED
7327-93283-0016 HANGING AROUND THE BANK LAST NIGHT WITH BURGLAR TOOLS REPEATED MISTER SWIFT IN DAZED TONES THAT'S RIGHT FROM ANDY HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY WERE BURGLAR TOOLS BECAUSE I SAW EM CRIED ANDY HE HAD EM IN A VALISE ON HIS MOTOR CYCLE
7327-93283-0017 AND YOU'RE SURE THEY WERE BURGLAR TOOLS ASKED THE CHIEF FOR HE DEPENDED ON ANDY TO BE HIS MOST IMPORTANT WITNESS
7327-93283-0018 HE TRIED TO HIDE EM BUT ME AN SAM WAS TOO QUICK FOR HIM HE WANTED TO LICK ME TOO
7327-93283-0019 BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW MY SON WAS WAITING FOR A CHANCE TO BREAK INTO THE BANK
7327-93283-0020 INQUIRED ANDY AS IF THAT WAS UNANSWERABLE WHAT WERE YOU HANGING AROUND HERE FOR MISTER SWIFT DEMANDED QUICKLY ME OH WELL ME AN SAM SNEDECKER WAS OUT TAKIN A WALK THAT'S ALL
7327-93283-0021 ANDY TOLD MORE ALONG THE SAME LINE BUT HIS TESTIMONY OF HAVING SEEN TOM NEAR THE BANK WITH A BAG OF ODD TOOLS COULD NOT BE SHAKEN
7327-93283-0022 IN FACT IT WAS TRUE AS FAR AS IT WENT BUT OF COURSE THE TOOLS WERE ONLY THOSE FOR THE AIRSHIP THE SAME ONES MISTER SHARP HAD SENT THE LAD AFTER SAM SNEDECKER WAS CALLED IN AFTER ANDY AND TOLD SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME STORY
7327-93283-0023 STILL OF COURSE HE KNEW TOM HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ROBBERY AND HE KNEW HIS SON HAD BEEN AT HOME ALL THE NIGHT PREVIOUS STILL THIS WAS RATHER NEGATIVE EVIDENCE
7327-93283-0024 YOU SAY YOU ALSO SUSPECT MISTER DAMON OF COMPLICITY IN THIS AFFAIR HE WENT ON TO THE CHIEF OF POLICE WE SURE DO REPLIED MISTER SIMONSON
7327-93283-0025 WOULD HE ROB THE BANK WHERE HIS OWN FUNDS WERE WE ARE PREPARED FOR THAT DECLARED THE PRESIDENT IT IS TRUE THAT MISTER DAMON HAS ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN OUR BANK BUT WE BELIEVE HE DEPOSITED IT ONLY AS A BLIND SO AS TO COVER UP HIS TRACKS
7327-93283-0026 IT IS A DEEP LAID SCHEME AND ESCAPING IN THE AIRSHIP IS PART OF IT I AM SORRY MISTER SWIFT THAT I HAVE TO BELIEVE YOUR SON AND HIS ACCOMPLICE GUILTY BUT I AM OBLIGED TO CHIEF YOU HAD BETTER SEND OUT A GENERAL ALARM THE AIRSHIP OUGHT TO BE EASY TO TRACE
7327-93283-0027 I'LL TELEGRAPH AT ONCE SAID THE OFFICIAL AND YOU BELIEVE MY SON GUILTY SOLELY ON THE TESTIMONY OF THESE TWO BOYS WHO AS IS WELL KNOWN ARE HIS ENEMIES ASKED MISTER SWIFT THE CLUE THEY GAVE US IS CERTAINLY MOST IMPORTANT SAID THE PRESIDENT
7327-93283-0028 ANDY CAME TO US AND TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN AS SOON AS IT BECAME KNOWN THAT THE BANK HAD BEEN ROBBED
7327-93283-0029 AH THEN THERE IS A REWARD OFFERED INQUIRED MISTER SWIFT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ANSWERED MISTER PENDERGAST
7327-93283-0030 MET EARLY THIS MORNING AND DECIDED TO OFFER THAT SUM AND I'M GOING TO GET IT ANNOUNCED THE RED HAIRED LAD AGAIN MISTER SWIFT WAS MUCH DOWNCAST THERE SEEMED TO BE NOTHING MORE TO SAY AND BEING A MAN UNVERSED IN THE WAYS OF THE WORLD HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO
7327-93283-0031 HE RETURNED HONE WHEN MISSUS BAGGERT WAS MADE ACQUAINTED WITH THE NEWS SHE WAXED INDIGNANT OUR TOM A THIEF SHE CRIED
7327-93283-0032 WHY DON'T THEY ACCUSE ME AND MISTER JACKSON AND YOU THE IDEA YOU OUGHT TO HIRE A LAWYER MISTER SWIFT AND PROSECUTE THOSE MEN FOR SLANDER DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD PLAN I CERTAINLY DO WHY THEY HAVE NO EVIDENCE AT ALL
7327-93283-0033 GET A LAWYER AND HAVE TOM'S INTERESTS LOOKED AFTER MISTER SWIFT GLAD TO HAVE SOMEONE SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY WITH FELT SOMEWHAT BETTER WHEN A WELL KNOWN SHOPTON ATTORNEY ASSURED HIM THAT THE EVIDENCE AGAINST TOM WAS OF SUCH A FLIMSY CHARACTER
7327-93283-0034 THAT IT WOULD SCARCELY HOLD IN A COURT OF JUSTICE BUT THEY HAVE WARRANTS FOR HIM AND MISTER DAMON DECLARED THE INVENTOR VERY TRUE BUT IT IS EASY TO SWEAR OUT A WARRANT AGAINST ANY ONE IT'S A DIFFERENT MATTER TO PROVE A PERSON GUILTY BUT THEY CAN ARREST MY SON
7327-93283-0035 IT'S DISGRACEFUL SAID MISSUS BAGGERT NOT AT ALL MY DEAR MADAM NOT AT ALL GOOD AND INNOCENT PERSONS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED THEY ARE GOING TO SEND OUT A GENERAL ALARM FOR MY SON BEWAILED MISTER SWIFT
7327-93283-0036 I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER WAY TO KEEP OUT OF THE CLUTCHES OF THE POLICE AND THEIR SILLY CHARGE CHUCKLED THE LAWYER NOW DON'T WORRY MISTER SWIFT IT WILL ALL COME OUT RIGHT
7327-93283-0037 THE INVENTOR TRIED TO BELIEVE SO BUT THOUGH HE KNEW HIS SON WAS INNOCENT IT WAS RATHER HARD TO SEE WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS BIG POSTERS ON ALL THE VACANT WALLS AND FENCES
7327-93283-0038 I GUESS TOM SWIFT WILL WISH HE'D BEEN MORE DECENT TO ME WHEN I COLLECT THAT MONEY FOR HIS ARREST SAID ANDY TO HIS CRONY SAM THE DAY THE BILLS WERE POSTED YES BUT I GET MY SHARE DON'T I ASKED SAM
7327-93283-0039 WISH THEY'D HURRY UP AND ARREST HIM WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS THE COUNTRY WAS COVERED WITH POSTERS TELLING OF THE ROBBERY AND THE REWARD AND POLICE OFFICIALS IN CITIES LARGE AND SMALL AND IN TOWNS AND VILLAGES
7327-93283-0040 WERE NOTIFIED BY TELEGRAPH TO ARREST AND CAPTURE AT ANY COST THE OCCUPANTS OF A CERTAIN LARGE RED AIRSHIP MISTER SWIFT ON THE ADVICE OF HIS LAWYER SENT SEVERAL TELEGRAMS TO TOM APPRISING HIM OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED
