152-87733-0000 CHAPTER SIX THE SILVERY TOUCH OF FORTUNE IS TOO OFTEN GILT WITH BETRAYAL THE MEDDLING MOUTH OF EXTRAVAGANCE SWALLOWS EVERY DESIRE AND EATS THE HEART OF HONESTY WITH PICKLED PRIDE
152-87733-0001 THE IMPOSTURY OF POSITION IS PETTY AND ENDS AS IT SHOULD COMMENCE WITH STIRRING STRIFE
152-87733-0002 AND TOO SELDOM TERMINATES VICTORIOUSLY GREAT MERCY ONLY ANOTHER WEEK AND I SHALL ALMOST CEASE TO BE A FREE THINKER JUST SEVEN DAYS MORE AND WHAT I SHALL OPENLY HAVE TO CONFESS TO THE WORLD AN UNTRUTH
152-87733-0003 WOULD THERE BE ANY MEANS OF FLIGHT FROM THE DANGEROUS DRAGON THAT HAUNTS ME NIGHT AND DAY COULD ANYTHING POSSIBLE BE DONE TO SAVE MYSELF FROM FALSE ALLIANCE TOO LATE TOO LATE
152-87733-0004 ONLY SEVEN DAYS AND THIS BEAUTIFUL BOUDOIR SHALL OWN ME NO MORE WITH ITS WALLS OF PUREST WHITE AND GILDED BORDERS JUST SEVEN DAYS AND I SHALL BE FETTERED WITH CHAINS OF DRAGGING DISLIKE AND DISAPPOINTMENT
152-87733-0005 ONLY SEVEN DAYS AND THUS SHALL END MY CHERISHED HOPES MY GIRLISH PRIDE MY MOST ARDENT WISH BUT ALAS NOT MY LOVE SEVEN DAYS MORE SHALL SEE MY OWN DARLING OS SUDDENLY
152-87733-0006 IRENE WAS AROUSED BY THE RINGING OF THE BREAKFAST BELL BEFORE SHE GOT TIME TO FINISH THE SENTENCE THAT TROUBLED HER WEARY BRAIN FOR MONTHS BEFORE DRESSING HERSELF WITH FRANTIC EXPERTNESS SHE DASHED DOWN THE WINDING STAIRCASE
152-87733-0007 WITH AN ALACRITY BETTER IMAGINED THAN DESCRIBED AND RUSHING INTO THE BREAKFAST ROOM WHERE LORD AND LADY DILWORTH EAGERLY AWAITED HER PRESENTED THE OUTWARD MOCKING APPEARANCE OF BEING THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS
152-87733-0008 HER BELOVED BENEFACTORS WHO HAD BEEN THE PRIME MOVERS IN THE MATTER OF MATRIMONY SAW PLAINLY A SADDENED LOOK ABOUT THE LOVELY FACE
152-87733-0009 AND ASKING WHY IT APPEARED AT THIS GAY TIME WAS ANSWERED EVASIVELY INDEED LORD AND LADY DILWORTH WERE WHOLLY IGNORANT OF THE PRESENT STATE OF AFFAIRS
152-87733-0010 OR HER MADDENED DESIRE TO BECOME THE WIFE OF A POOR TUTOR HAD SHE ONLY TAKEN INTO HER CONFIDENCE HER WHOSE WISE COUNSEL AND MOTHERLY EXAMPLE WERE AT ALL TIMES A PROMPT STEP TO DECISION
152-87733-0011 OR HAD SHE ONLY HINTED TO LADY DILWORTH HER MANIFEST INABILITY TO RETURN SIR JOHN'S GREAT AFFECTION MATTERS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE REACHED ANOTHER CLIMAX BUT OWING TO THE PRESENT PRECARIOUS POSITION IN WHICH LORD AND LADY DILWORTH STOOD
152-87733-0012 EITHER IN TIME OF REJOICING OR SORROWING PREPARATIONS WERE AT LAST ALMOST COMPLETED FOR SUCH AN AUSPICIOUS EVENT INVITATIONS WERE ISSUED NUMEROUSLY FOR THE RECEPTION TO BE HELD AT DILWORTH CASTLE AFTER IRENE'S MARRIAGE
152-87733-0013 BUT SPARINGLY DURING THE CEREMONY ALL OF WHICH WERE MOSTLY ACCEPTED COSTLY MULTIPLYING AND VARIED WERE THE GIFTS RECEIVED BY IRENE ENOUGH TO MAKE A PRINCESS STARE WITH STARTLING BEWILDERMENT
152-87733-0014 NONE CAME FROM IRENE'S TUTOR OSCAR OTWELL AND ALTHOUGH HE WAS THE FIRST TO WHOM LADY DILWORTH ADDRESSED AN INVITATION STILL THERE WAS NO REPLY MUCH TO THE ANNOYANCE AND ASTONISHMENT OF HOSTESS ON THE ONE HAND
152-87733-0015 AND NEVER BETTER EXEMPLIFIED THAN IN THE PRESENT EXISTING STATE OF AFFAIRS
152-87733-0016 WAS DEADLY SO TO OSCAR BUT FUTURE FACTS HAD TO BE SOLVED WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY WOULD BE TREATED WITH MORE COMPARATIVE REVERENCE THAN HERETOFORE BY HIM WHO SUFFERED SEVERELY
152-87733-0017 YEA ACUTELY FROM THE BLOW STRUCK HIM ON THE EVE OF ASPIRATION AND ACHIEVEMENT LOVE ALAS WHEN SMITTEN WITH THE SWORD OF INDIFFERENCE DIETH SOON BUT ONCE STRUCK ON THE TUNNELLED CHEEK OF SECRECY WITH THE HAND OF PITY
152-87733-0018 THERE LEAVES A SCAR OF INDELIBLE INTOLERANCE UNTIL WIPED OUT FOR EVER WITH THE CURATIVE BALSAM OF BATTLED FREEDOM SIR JOHN AND IRENE MET IN DILWORTH CASTLE FOR THE LAST TIME ON THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY OF AUGUST
152-87733-0019 BEING THE DAY SET APART FOR THE CELEBRATION OF THEIR MARRIAGE IT COMMENCED WITH THE RINGING OF THE VILLAGE BELLS THE SUN SHONE FORTH IN ALL HIS UNIVERSAL GLORY
152-87733-0020 EMBLEMS OF THE APPROACHING FESTIVITY DID NOT FAIL TO APPEAR ON THE HOUSETOPS OF THE HUMBLEST VILLAGE PEASANT GLADNESS REIGNED THROUGHOUT THE HOUSEHOLD AND ALL HEARTS SAVE TWO REJOICED WITH UNABATED ACTIVITY
152-87733-0021 IT WAS A MORNING NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN BY LORD AND LADY DILWORTH WHO ON THAT DAY WOULD BE ROBBED OF THE TREASURE HELD FIRM AND FAST BY THEM FOR THE LENGTHENED PERIOD OF NINE YEARS AND WHICH THEY YIELDED UP WITH HEARTS OF SORROW
152-87733-0022 THE INTENSE EXCITEMENT THAT FOR WEEKS BEFORE HAD FOUND SUCH REFUGE WITHIN THEIR CHERISHED AND MUCH LOVED HOME
152-87733-0023 IT WOULD DIE ON THE DOORSTEP OF APPARENT BEREAVEMENT NEVER MORE TO APPEAR WITHIN DILWORTH CASTLE UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES THEY KNEW WELL THAT THE GNAWING JAWS OF POVERTY WHICH FOR YEARS HAD FAILED TO EXPOSE THEIR GRINDING POWER
152-87733-0024 HAD REACHED THE LAST AND ONLY BITE OF SUDDEN TERMINATION AND THEREBY STAMPED THEIR MARKS OF MELANCHOLY SO IMPRESSIVELY UPON THE NOBLE BROWS OF THE WORTHY OWNERS OF DILWORTH CASTLE THAT TIME COULD NEVER BLOT THEM FROM OBSERVATION
152-87733-0025 AS BEFORE STATED FEW WERE THOSE INVITED TO BE PRESENT AT THE WEDDING CEREMONY WHICH WAS TO TAKE PLACE ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK NOON SIR JOHN ARRIVED AT THE CASTLE SHORTLY BEFORE THAT TIME LOOKING CHARMING INDEED
152-87733-0026 THOUGH DEPARTING FROM THE RULES LAID DOWN BY LADY DILWORTH DEMANDED FROM ALL PRESENT REMARKS BORDERING ON SIMILARITY SHE LOOKED NERVOUSLY PALE BUT QUEENLY
152-87733-0027 AND MASTERED THOROUGHLY THE EXPOSURE OF THE PAINFUL AGONY THROUGH WHICH SHE WAS PASSING KNOWING AS SHE DID AND FULLY BELIEVED THAT ALL IS NOT GOLD THAT GLITTERS
152-87733-0028 SHE WAS RECONCILED THAT NEITHER THE MARRIAGE ROBE OF PURITY
152-87733-0029 THE BISHOP OF BARELEGS AND CANON FOOT WITH HIGHLY IMPRESSED AND OPEN FALSEHOOD AS THAT PRACTISED BY HER IN THE ABSENCE OF LABOURING UNDER SUCH A SOLEMN VOW WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE BREATHLESS SURPRISE
152-87733-0030 OF LADY DILWORTH CHIEFLY AND THOSE PRESENT ALSO WHO ONLY THE EVENING PREVIOUS HAD BEEN POURING SUCH PRAISES OVER THE MAGNIFICENT DUCHESSE SATIN GOWN
152-87733-0031 ARRAYED IN AN IRISH POPLIN OF THE DARKEST VISIBLE SHADE OF GREEN WITHOUT EITHER TRAIN OR FLOWER OF DISTINCTION NOT EVEN A SPECK OF RIBBON OR BORDER OF LACE AND NO ORNAMENT ONLY THE VALUED NECKLET WHICH GRACED HER PEARLY THROAT
152-87733-0032 TO BESTOW UPON HER HIS CHOICE COLLECTION OF LOVE'S PUREST FRAGRANCE WHICH SHOULD CAST THE SWEETEST SCENT OF MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP THROUGHOUT THE DAZZLING APARTMENTS OF THE MANSION SHE WAS ABOUT TO GRACE
152-87733-0033 THAT SHE DARE NOT TRUST HERSELF TO OFFER HER THE FIRST MOTHERLY EMBRACE IRENE PERCEIVING THE GREAT EMBARRASSMENT OF HER BELOVED LADY DILWORTH GLIDED ACROSS THE ROOM
152-87733-0034 AND SITTING DOWN TO THE RIGHT OF HER UPON WHOM SHE HAD THAT DAY FLUNG IN THE FACE OF DEVOTION THE LAST DREGS OF DEFIANCE BEGGED TO OFFER AN APOLOGY FOR SUCH UNRULY CONDUCT AND ADDED
152-87733-0035 THAT ALL WOULD BE REVEALED AT A FUTURE DATE WHEN LEAST EXPECTED IN THE VERY ROOM WHERE SIR JOHN WAS FIRST PUZZLED CONCERNING THE BEAUTIFUL PORTRAIT WAS HE NOW MADE THE RECIPIENT OF THE ORIGINAL
152-87733-0036 AFTER THE IMPORTANT CEREMONY WAS PERFORMED AND THE REGISTER SIGNED SIR JOHN AND LADY DUNFERN WHEN THE USUAL CONGRATULATIONS WERE ENDED
152-87733-0037 THUS WERE JOINED TWO HEARTS OF WIDELY DIFFERENT BEAT ONE OF INTENSE LOVE WHICH HEARSAY NEVER COULD SHAKE THE OTHER OF DIRE DISLIKE WHICH REASON COULD NEVER ALTER BORN UNDER A LUCKY STAR
152-87733-0038 WAS THE WHISPERED ECHO THROUGHOUT THE DISTINGUISHED GUESTS WHO SAT DOWN TO BREAKFAST AFTER THE JUNCTION OF OPPOSITES YEA THIS WAS A REMARK OF TRUTH VISIBLY
152-87733-0039 HAD NOT THE TUITIONAL CLICK OF BYGONE ATTACHMENT KEPT MOVING WITH MEASURED PACE UNTIL STOPPED AFTER MONTHS OR IT MAY BE SMALL YEARS OF CONSTANT SWINGING
152-87733-0040 DID LADY DUNFERN EVER DREAM THAT HER APOLOGY FOR DISOBEDIENCE TO LADY DILWORTH'S ORDERS IN NOT ARRAYING HERSELF IN THE GARB OF GLISTENING GLORY COULD EVER BE ACCEPTED EVEN BY THE KIND AND LOVING LADY DILWORTH
152-87733-0041 DID SHE IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT SHE TO WHOM SHE OWED ANYTHING BUT DISOBEDIENCE EVEN IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM SHOULD BE WRESTED FROM HER ARMS OF COMPANIONSHIP ERE HER RETURN TO DUNFERN MANSION
152-87733-0042 DID THE THOUGHT EVER FLASH THROUGH HER MIND THAT NEVER AGAIN WOULD SHE BE ABLE TO POUR INTO THE EAR OF HER TRUSTED HELPER THE SECRETS OF THE HEART OF DECEPTION WHICH FOR THE PAST SEVEN MONTHS HAD RAGED SO FURIOUSLY WITHIN HER
152-87733-0043 BETTER LEAVE HER TO THE FREEDOM OF A WILL THAT ERE LONG WOULD SINK THE SHIP OF OPULENCE IN THE SEA OF PENURY AND WRING FROM HER THE WORDS LEAVE ME NOW DECEPTIVE DEMON OF DELUDED MOCKERY
152-87733-0044 LURK NO MORE AROUND THE VALE OF VANITY LIKE A VINDICTIVE VIPER STRIKE THE LYRE OF LIVING DECEPTION TO THE STRAINS OF DULL DEADNESS DESPAIR AND DOUBT
