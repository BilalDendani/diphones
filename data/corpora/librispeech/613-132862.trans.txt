613-132862-0000 A FEW PARABLES IN A FIELD OF RIPENING CORN I CAME TO A PLACE WHICH HAD BEEN TRAMPLED DOWN BY SOME RUTHLESS FOOT
613-132862-0001 EVERY ONE OF THEM ALIKE STANDING THERE SO ERECT AND BEARING THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE EAR
613-132862-0002 RED AND BLUE AND VIOLET HOW PRETTY THEY LOOKED AS THEY GREW THERE SO NATURALLY WITH THEIR LITTLE FOLIAGE BUT THOUGHT I THEY ARE QUITE USELESS THEY BEAR NO FRUIT THEY ARE MERE WEEDS
613-132862-0003 SUFFERED TO REMAIN ONLY BECAUSE THERE IS NO GETTING RID OF THEM AND YET BUT FOR THESE FLOWERS THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO CHARM THE EYE IN THAT WILDERNESS OF STALKS THEY ARE EMBLEMATIC OF
613-132862-0004 POETRY AND ART WHICH IN CIVIC LIFE SO SEVERE BUT STILL USEFUL AND NOT WITHOUT ITS FRUIT PLAY THE SAME PART AS FLOWERS IN THE CORN
613-132862-0005 THERE ARE SOME REALLY BEAUTIFULLY LANDSCAPES IN THE WORLD BUT THE HUMAN FIGURES IN THEM ARE POOR AND YOU HAD NOT BETTER LOOK AT THEM
613-132862-0006 THE FLY SHOULD BE USED AS THE SYMBOL OF IMPERTINENCE AND AUDACITY FOR WHILST ALL OTHER ANIMALS SHUN MAN MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND RUN AWAY
613-132862-0007 EVEN BEFORE HE COMES NEAR THEM THE FLY LIGHTS UPON HIS VERY NOSE TWO CHINAMEN TRAVELING IN EUROPE WENT TO THE THEATRE FOR THE FIRST TIME
613-132862-0008 ONE OF THEM DID NOTHING BUT STUDY THE MACHINERY AND HE SUCCEEDED IN FINDING OUT HOW IT WAS WORKED THE OTHER TRIED TO GET AT THE MEANING OF THE PIECE IN SPITE OF HIS IGNORANCE OF THE LANGUAGE HERE
613-132862-0009 YOU HAVE THE ASTRONOMER AND THE PHILOSOPHER WISDOM WHICH IS ONLY THEORETICAL AND NEVER PUT INTO PRACTICE IS LIKE A DOUBLE ROSE
613-132862-0010 ITS COLOR AND PERFUME ARE DELIGHTFUL BUT IT WITHERS AWAY AND LEAVES NO SEED NO ROSE WITHOUT A THORN YES BUT MANY A THORN WITHOUT A ROSE
613-132862-0011 A WIDE SPREADING APPLE TREE STOOD IN FULL BLOOM AND BEHIND IT A STRAIGHT FIR RAISED ITS DARK AND TAPERING HEAD
613-132862-0012 LOOK AT THE THOUSANDS OF GAY BLOSSOMS WHICH COVER ME EVERYWHERE SAID THE APPLE TREE WHAT HAVE YOU TO SHOW IN COMPARISON DARK GREEN NEEDLES THAT IS TRUE REPLIED THE FIR
613-132862-0013 BUT WHEN WINTER COMES YOU WILL BE BARED OF YOUR GLORY AND I SHALL BE AS I AM NOW ONCE AS I WAS BOTANIZING UNDER AN OAK
613-132862-0014 I FOUND AMONGST A NUMBER OF OTHER PLANTS OF SIMILAR HEIGHT ONE THAT WAS DARK IN COLOR WITH TIGHTLY CLOSED LEAVES
613-132862-0015 WHEN I TOUCHED IT IT SAID TO ME IN FIRM TONES LET ME ALONE I AM NOT FOR YOUR COLLECTION LIKE THESE PLANTS TO WHICH NATURE HAS GIVEN ONLY A SINGLE YEAR OF LIFE I AM A LITTLE OAK
613-132862-0016 AS A CHILD AS A YOUTH OFTEN EVEN AS A FULL GROWN MAN NAY HIS WHOLE LIFE LONG HE GOES ABOUT AMONG HIS FELLOWS LOOKING LIKE THEM AND SEEMINGLY AS UNIMPORTANT
613-132862-0017 BUT LET HIM ALONE HE WILL NOT DIE TIME WILL COME AND BRING THOSE WHO KNOW HOW TO VALUE HIM
613-132862-0018 THE MAN WHO GOES UP IN A BALLOON DOES NOT FEEL AS THOUGH HE WERE ASCENDING HE ONLY SEES THE EARTH SINKING DEEPER UNDER HIM THERE IS A MYSTERY
613-132862-0019 WHICH ONLY THOSE WILL UNDERSTAND WHO FEEL THE TRUTH OF IT YOUR ESTIMATION OF A MAN'S SIZE WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE DISTANCE AT WHICH YOU STAND FROM HIM
613-132862-0020 BUT IN TWO ENTIRELY OPPOSITE WAYS ACCORDING AS IT IS HIS PHYSICAL OR HIS MENTAL STATURE THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING THE ONE WILL SEEM SMALLER THE FARTHER OFF YOU MOVE THE OTHER
613-132862-0021 GREATER NATURE COVERS ALL HER WORKS WITH A VARNISH OF BEAUTY LIKE THE TENDER BLOOM THAT IS BREATHED AS IT WERE ON THE SURFACE OF A PEACH OR A PLUM
613-132862-0022 PAINTERS AND POETS LAY THEMSELVES OUT TO TAKE OFF THIS VARNISH TO STORE IT UP AND GIVE IT US TO BE ENJOYED AT OUR LEISURE WE DRINK DEEP OF THIS BEAUTY
613-132862-0023 LONG BEFORE WE ENTER UPON LIFE ITSELF AND WHEN AFTERWARDS WE COME TO SEE THE WORKS OF NATURE FOR OURSELVES THE VARNISH IS GONE THE ARTISTS HAVE USED IT UP AND WE HAVE ENJOYED IT IN ADVANCE
613-132862-0024 THUS IT IS THAT THE WORLD SO OFTEN APPEARS HARSH AND DEVOID OF CHARM NAY ACTUALLY REPULSIVE IT WERE BETTER TO LEAVE US TO DISCOVER THE VARNISH FOR OURSELVES THIS WOULD MEAN
613-132862-0025 THAT WE SHOULD NOT ENJOY IT ALL AT ONCE AND IN LARGE QUANTITIES WE SHOULD HAVE NO FINISHED PICTURES NO PERFECT POEMS BUT WE SHOULD LOOK AT ALL THINGS IN THAT GENIAL AND PLEASING LIGHT IN WHICH
613-132862-0026 EVEN NOW A CHILD OF NATURE SOMETIMES SEES THEM SOME ONE WHO HAS NOT ANTICIPATED HIS AESTHETIC PLEASURES BY THE HELP OF ART OR TAKEN THE CHARMS OF LIFE TOO EARLY
613-132862-0027 IS SO SHUT IN BY THE HOUSES THAT ARE BUILT ROUND ABOUT IT THAT THERE IS NO ONE SPOT FROM WHICH YOU CAN SEE IT AS A WHOLE THIS IS SYMBOLIC OF EVERYTHING GREAT OR BEAUTIFUL IN THE WORLD
613-132862-0028 IT OUGHT TO EXIST FOR ITS OWN SAKE ALONE BUT BEFORE VERY LONG IT IS MISUSED TO SERVE ALIEN ENDS
613-132862-0029 PEOPLE COME FROM ALL DIRECTIONS WANTING TO FIND IN IT SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE FOR THEMSELVES THEY STAND IN THE WAY AND SPOIL ITS EFFECT TO BE SURE THERE IS NOTHING SURPRISING IN THIS
613-132862-0030 FOR IN A WORLD OF NEED AND IMPERFECTION EVERYTHING IS SEIZED UPON WHICH CAN BE USED TO SATISFY WANT NOTHING IS EXEMPT FROM THIS SERVICE NO
613-132862-0031 NOT EVEN THOSE VERY THINGS WHICH ARISE ONLY WHEN NEED AND WANT ARE FOR A MOMENT LOST SIGHT OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE TRUE SOUGHT FOR THEIR OWN SAKES
613-132862-0032 THIS IS ESPECIALLY ILLUSTRATED AND CORROBORATED IN THE CASE OF INSTITUTIONS WHETHER GREAT OR SMALL WEALTHY OR POOR FOUNDED NO MATTER IN WHAT CENTURY OR IN WHAT LAND TO MAINTAIN AND ADVANCE HUMAN KNOWLEDGE
613-132862-0033 AND GENERALLY TO AFFORD HELP TO THOSE INTELLECTUAL EFFORTS WHICH ENNOBLE THE RACE WHEREVER THESE INSTITUTIONS MAY BE
613-132862-0034 IT IS NOT LONG BEFORE PEOPLE SNEAK UP TO THEM UNDER THE PRETENCE OF WISHING TO FURTHER THOSE SPECIAL ENDS WHILE THEY ARE REALLY LED ON BY THE DESIRE TO SECURE THE EMOLUMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN LEFT FOR THEIR FURTHERANCE
613-132862-0035 AND THUS TO SATISFY CERTAIN COARSE AND BRUTAL INSTINCTS OF THEIR OWN THUS IT IS THAT WE COME TO HAVE SO MANY CHARLATANS IN EVERY BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE THE CHARLATAN
613-132862-0036 TAKES VERY DIFFERENT SHAPES ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES BUT AT BOTTOM HE IS A MAN WHO CARES NOTHING ABOUT KNOWLEDGE FOR ITS OWN SAKE AND ONLY STRIVES TO GAIN THE SEMBLANCE OF IT THAT HE MAY USE IT FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL ENDS
613-132862-0037 WHICH ARE ALWAYS SELFISH AND MATERIAL EVERY HERO IS A SAMSON THE STRONG MAN SUCCUMBS TO THE INTRIGUES OF THE WEAK
613-132862-0038 AND THE MANY AND IF IN THE END HE LOSES ALL PATIENCE HE CRUSHES BOTH THEM AND HIMSELF OR HE IS LIKE GULLIVER AT LILLIPUT
613-132862-0039 OVERWHELMED BY AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF LITTLE MEN A MOTHER GAVE HER CHILDREN AESOP'S FABLES TO READ IN THE HOPE OF EDUCATING AND IMPROVING THEIR MINDS
613-132862-0040 BUT THEY VERY SOON BROUGHT THE BOOK BACK AND THE ELDEST WISE BEYOND HIS YEARS DELIVERED HIMSELF AS FOLLOWS THIS IS NO BOOK FOR US IT'S MUCH TOO CHILDISH AND STUPID
613-132862-0041 YOU CAN'T MAKE US BELIEVE THAT FOXES AND WOLVES AND RAVENS ARE ABLE TO TALK WE'VE GOT BEYOND STORIES OF THAT KIND IN THESE YOUNG HOPEFULS YOU HAVE THE ENLIGHTENED RATIONALISTS OF THE FUTURE
613-132862-0042 A NUMBER OF PORCUPINES HUDDLED TOGETHER FOR WARMTH ON A COLD DAY IN WINTER BUT AS THEY BEGAN TO PRICK ONE ANOTHER WITH THEIR QUILLS
613-132862-0043 THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DISPERSE HOWEVER THE COLD DROVE THEM TOGETHER AGAIN WHEN JUST THE SAME THING HAPPENED AT LAST AFTER MANY TURNS OF HUDDLING AND DISPERSING
613-132862-0044 IN THE SAME WAY THE NEED OF SOCIETY DRIVES THE HUMAN PORCUPINES TOGETHER ONLY TO BE MUTUALLY REPELLED BY THE MANY PRICKLY AND DISAGREEABLE QUALITIES OF THEIR NATURE
613-132862-0045 IS THE CODE OF POLITENESS AND FINE MANNERS AND THOSE WHO TRANSGRESS IT ARE ROUGHLY TOLD IN THE ENGLISH PHRASE TO KEEP THEIR DISTANCE BY THIS ARRANGEMENT
613-132862-0046 THE MUTUAL NEED OF WARMTH IS ONLY VERY MODERATELY SATISFIED BUT THEN PEOPLE DO NOT GET PRICKED
613-132862-0047 PREFERS TO REMAIN OUTSIDE WHERE HE WILL NEITHER PRICK OTHER PEOPLE
