663-128990-0000 WHEN THIS HAD BEEN DONE THEY FELT SAFE AND BEGAN TO ACT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN A MENAGERIE OF WILD BEASTS LET LOOSE UPON A BODY OF DEFENCELESS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN NOT ONLY DID THESE WRETCHED MEN RUSH INTO THE HOUSES STEALING EVERYTHING VALUABLE THEY COULD FIND AND WERE ABLE TO CARRY AWAY
663-128990-0001 BUT WHEN THEY HAD GATHERED TOGETHER ALL THEY COULD DISCOVER THEY TORTURED THEIR POOR PRISONERS BY EVERY CRUEL METHOD THEY COULD THINK OF IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM TELL WHERE MORE TREASURES WERE CONCEALED MANY OF THESE UNFORTUNATES HAD HAD NOTHING TO HIDE
663-128990-0002 AND THEREFORE COULD GIVE NO INFORMATION TO THEIR BRUTAL INQUISITORS AND OTHERS DIED WITHOUT TELLING WHAT THEY HAD DONE WITH THEIR VALUABLES WHEN THE TOWN HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY SEARCHED AND SIFTED THE PIRATES SENT MEN OUT
663-128990-0003 INTO THE LITTLE VILLAGES AND PLANTATIONS IN THE COUNTRY AND EVEN HUNTERS AND SMALL FARMERS WERE CAPTURED AND MADE TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING THEY POSSESSED WHICH WAS WORTH TAKING FOR NEARLY THREE WEEKS THESE OUTRAGEOUS PROCEEDINGS CONTINUED
663-128990-0004 AND TO PROVE THAT THEY WERE LOWER THAN THE BRUTE BEASTS THEY ALLOWED THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE PRISONERS COLLECTED IN THE CHURCH TO PERISH OF HUNGER THERE WERE NOT PROVISIONS ENOUGH IN THE TOWN FOR THE PIRATES OWN USES AND FOR THESE MISERABLE CREATURES ALSO AND SO
663-128990-0005 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SMALL QUANTITY OF MULE FLESH WHICH MANY OF THE PRISONERS COULD NOT EAT THEY GOT NOTHING WHATEVER AND SLOWLY STARVED WHEN L'OLONNOIS AND HIS FRIENDS HAD BEEN IN POSSESSION OF GIBRALTAR FOR ABOUT A MONTH
663-128990-0006 THEY THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO LEAVE BUT THEIR GREEDY SOULS WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE BOOTY THEY HAD ALREADY OBTAINED AND THEY THEREFORE SENT MESSAGES TO THE SPANIARDS WHO WERE STILL CONCEALED IN THE FORESTS
663-128990-0007 THAT UNLESS IN THE COURSE OF TWO DAYS A RANSOM OF TEN THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT WERE PAID TO THEM THEY WOULD BURN THE TOWN TO THE GROUND NO MATTER WHAT THEY THOUGHT OF THIS HEARTLESS DEMAND IT WAS NOT EASY FOR THE SCATTERED CITIZENS TO COLLECT SUCH A SUM AS THIS
663-128990-0008 AND THE TWO DAYS PASSED WITHOUT THE PAYMENT OF THE RANSOM AND THE RELENTLESS PIRATES PROMPTLY CARRIED OUT THEIR THREAT AND SET THE TOWN ON FIRE IN VARIOUS PLACES WHEN THE POOR SPANIARDS SAW THIS AND PERCEIVED THAT THEY WERE ABOUT TO LOSE EVEN THEIR HOMES
663-128990-0009 BUT THEY WERE NOT EXTINGUISHED UNTIL A QUARTER OF THE TOWN WAS ENTIRELY BURNED AND A FINE CHURCH REDUCED TO ASHES WHEN THE BUCCANEERS FOUND THEY COULD SQUEEZE NOTHING MORE OUT OF THE TOWN THEY WENT ON BOARD THEIR SHIPS CARRYING WITH THEM ALL THE PLUNDER AND BOOTY THEY HAD COLLECTED
663-128990-0010 AND AMONG THEIR SPOILS WERE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED SLAVES OF ALL AGES AND BOTH SEXES WHO HAD BEEN OFFERED AN OPPORTUNITY TO RANSOM THEMSELVES BUT WHO OF COURSE HAD NO MONEY WITH WHICH TO BUY THEIR FREEDOM AND WHO WERE NOW CONDEMNED TO A CAPTIVITY
663-128990-0011 WORSE THAN ANYTHING THEY HAD EVER KNOWN BEFORE NOW THE EIGHT SHIPS WITH THEIR DEMON CREWS SAILED AWAY OVER THE LAKE TOWARD MARACAIBO IT WAS QUITE POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO GET OUT TO SEA WITHOUT REVISITING THIS UNFORTUNATE TOWN
663-128990-0012 AND THEN HE SENT SOME MESSENGERS ASHORE TO INFORM THE ALREADY HALF RUINED CITIZENS THAT UNLESS THEY SENT HIM THIRTY THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT HE WOULD ENTER THEIR TOWN AGAIN CARRY AWAY EVERYTHING THEY HAD LEFT AND BURN THE PLACE TO THE GROUND THE POOR CITIZENS
663-128990-0013 SENT A COMMITTEE TO CONFER WITH THE PIRATES AND WHILE THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE GOING ON SOME OF THE CONSCIENCELESS BUCCANEERS WENT ON SHORE AND CARRIED OFF FROM ONE OF THE GREAT CHURCHES ITS IMAGES PICTURES AND EVEN ITS BELLS
663-128990-0014 IT WAS AT LAST ARRANGED THAT THE CITIZENS SHOULD PAY TWENTY THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT WHICH WAS THE UTMOST SUM THEY COULD POSSIBLY RAISE AND IN ADDITION TO THIS FIVE HUNDRED HEAD OF BEEF CATTLE
663-128990-0015 AND THE PIRATES PROMISED THAT IF THIS WERE DONE THEY WOULD DEPART AND MOLEST THE TOWN NO MORE THE MONEY WAS PAID THE CATTLE WERE PUT ON BOARD THE SHIPS AND TO THE UNSPEAKABLE RELIEF OF THE CITIZENS
663-128990-0016 THERE WAS NOTHING ON EARTH THAT THEY WOULD BE SO GLAD TO FURNISH HIM AS A PILOT TO SHOW HIM HOW TO SAIL AWAY FROM THEIR SHORES THE PILOT WAS INSTANTLY SENT TO THE FLEET AND L'OLONNOIS AND HIS DEVASTATING BAND DEPARTED
663-128990-0017 THEY DID NOT GO DIRECTLY TO TORTUGA BUT STOPPED AT A LITTLE ISLAND NEAR HISPANIOLA WHICH WAS INHABITED BY FRENCH BUCCANEERS AND THIS DELAY WAS MADE ENTIRELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIVIDING THE BOOTY
663-128990-0018 IT SEEMS STRANGE THAT ANY PRINCIPLE OF RIGHT AND JUSTICE SHOULD HAVE BEEN REGARDED BY THESE DISHONEST KNAVES EVEN IN THEIR RELATIONS TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY HAD RIGID RULES IN REGARD TO THE DIVISION OF THEIR SPOILS
663-128990-0019 AND ACCORDING TO THESE CURIOUS REGULATIONS THE WHOLE AMOUNT OF PLUNDER WAS APPORTIONED AMONG THE OFFICERS AND CREWS OF THE DIFFERENT SHIPS BEFORE THE REGULAR ALLOTMENT OF SHARES WAS MADE
663-128990-0020 THE CLAIMS OF THE WOUNDED WERE FULLY SATISFIED ACCORDING TO THEIR ESTABLISHED CODE FOR THE LOSS OF A RIGHT ARM A MAN WAS PAID ABOUT SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS OR SIX SLAVES FOR THE LOSS OF A LEFT ARM FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR FIVE SLAVES
663-128990-0021 FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR FIVE SLAVES
663-128990-0022 FOR A MISSING LEFT LEG FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS OR FOUR SLAVES FOR AN EYE OR A FINGER ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS
663-128990-0023 THESE LATTER WERE APPORTIONED AMONG THE MEN IN THE MOST RIDICULOUS MANNER THE PIRATES HAVING NO IDEA OF THE RELATIVE VALUE OF THE JEWELS SOME OF THEM PREFERRING LARGE AND WORTHLESS COLORED STONES TO SMALLER DIAMONDS AND RUBIES WHEN ALL THEIR WICKEDLY GAINED PROPERTY HAD BEEN DIVIDED
663-128990-0024 THE PIRATES SAILED TO TORTUGA WHERE THEY PROCEEDED WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME TO GET RID OF THE WEALTH THEY HAD AMASSED THEY ATE THEY DRANK THEY GAMBLED THEY CROWDED THE TAVERNS AS TAVERNS HAVE NEVER BEEN CROWDED BEFORE
663-128990-0025 THEY SOLD THEIR VALUABLE MERCHANDISE FOR A TWENTIETH PART OF ITS VALUE TO SOME OF THE MORE LEVEL HEADED PEOPLE OF THE PLACE AND HAVING RIOTED GAMBLED AND COMMITTED EVERY SORT OF EXTRAVAGANCE FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS
663-128990-0026 FOUND THEMSELVES AS POOR AS WHEN THEY HAD STARTED OFF ON THEIR EXPEDITION IT TOOK THEM ALMOST AS LONG TO DIVIDE THEIR SPOILS AS IT DID TO GET RID OF THEM AS THESE PRECIOUS RASCALS HAD NOW NOTHING TO LIVE UPON
663-128990-0027 IT WAS NECESSARY TO START OUT AGAIN AND COMMIT SOME MORE ACTS OF ROBBERY AND RUIN AND L'OLONNOIS WHOSE RAPACIOUS MIND SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FILLED WITH A DESIRE FOR TOWN DESTROYING PROJECTED AN EXPEDITION TO NICARAGUA
663-128990-0028 WHERE HE PROPOSED TO PILLAGE AND DEVASTATE AS MANY TOWNS AND VILLAGES AS POSSIBLE HIS REPUTATION AS A SUCCESSFUL COMMANDER WAS NOW SO HIGH THAT HE HAD NO TROUBLE IN GETTING MEN FOR MORE OFFERED THEMSELVES THAN HE COULD POSSIBLY TAKE
663-128990-0029 HE DEPARTED WITH SEVEN HUNDRED MEN AND SIX SHIPS STOPPING ON THE WAY NEAR THE COAST OF CUBA AND ROBBING SOME POOR FISHERMEN OF THEIR BOATS WHICH HE WOULD NEED IN SHALLOW WATER
663-128990-0030 THEIR VOYAGE WAS A VERY LONG ONE AND THEY WERE BESET BY CALMS AND INSTEAD OF REACHING NICARAGUA THEY DRIFTED INTO THE GULF OF HONDURAS HERE THEY FOUND THEMSELVES NEARLY OUT OF PROVISIONS
663-128990-0031 AND WERE OBLIGED TO LAND AND SCOUR THE COUNTRY TO FIND SOMETHING TO EAT LEAVING THEIR SHIPS THEY BEGAN A LAND MARCH THROUGH THE UNFORTUNATE REGION WHERE THEY NOW FOUND THEMSELVES THEY ROBBED INDIANS THEY ROBBED VILLAGES
663-128990-0032 THEY DEVASTATED LITTLE TOWNS TAKING EVERYTHING THAT THEY CARED FOR AND BURNING WHAT THEY DID NOT WANT AND TREATING THE PEOPLE THEY CAPTURED WITH VILER CRUELTIES THAN ANY IN WHICH THE BUCCANEERS HAD YET INDULGED
663-128990-0033 THEIR GREAT OBJECT WAS TO TAKE EVERYTHING THEY COULD FIND AND THEN TRY TO MAKE THE PEOPLE CONFESS WHERE OTHER THINGS WERE HIDDEN MEN AND WOMEN WERE HACKED TO PIECES WITH SWORDS
663-128990-0034 TO TEAR OUT HIS TONGUE WITH HIS OWN HANDS AND IT IS SAID THAT ON SOME OCCASIONS HIS FURY WAS SO GREAT THAT HE WOULD CUT OUT THE HEART OF A MAN AND BITE AT IT WITH HIS GREAT TEETH
663-128990-0035 NO MORE DREADFUL MISERIES COULD BE CONCEIVED THAN THOSE INFLICTED UPON THE PEACEFUL INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THESE WRETCHES PASSED
663-128990-0036 THEY FREQUENTLY MET AMBUSCADES OF SPANIARDS WHO ENDEAVORED TO STOP THEIR PROGRESS BUT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE THE PIRATES WERE TOO STRONG IN NUMBER AND TOO SAVAGE IN DISPOSITION TO BE RESISTED BY ORDINARY CHRISTIANS AND THEY KEPT ON THEIR WICKED WAY
663-128990-0037 AT LAST THEY REACHED A TOWN CALLED SAN PEDRO WHICH WAS FAIRLY WELL DEFENDED HAVING AROUND IT A GREAT HEDGE OF PRICKLY THORNS BUT THORNS CANNOT KEEP OUT PIRATES AND AFTER A SEVERE FIGHT
663-128990-0038 THIS WAS GIVEN AND THE TIME WAS OCCUPIED BY THE PEOPLE IN RUNNING AWAY INTO THE WOODS AND CARRYING OFF THEIR VALUABLES BUT WHEN THE TWO HOURS HAD EXPIRED L'OLONNOIS AND HIS MEN ENTERED THE TOWN AND INSTEAD OF RUMMAGING AROUND TO SEE WHAT THEY COULD FIND
663-128990-0039 WHO DID NOT FIND PROVISIONS ENOUGH TO FEED HIS MEN THEIR SUPPLIES RAN VERY LOW AND IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY WERE IN DANGER OF STARVATION CONSEQUENTLY THEY MADE THEIR WAY BY THE MOST DIRECT COURSE TO THE COAST
663-128990-0040 WHERE THEY HOPED TO BE ABLE TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT IF THEY COULD FIND NOTHING ELSE THEY MIGHT AT LEAST CATCH FISH ON THEIR WAY EVERY RASCAL OF THEM PREPARED HIMSELF A NET
663-128990-0041 WHICH GREW IN ABUNDANCE IN THOSE REGIONS IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT CATCH HIMSELF A SUPPER WHEN HE REACHED THE SEA AFTER A TIME THE BUCCANEERS GOT BACK TO THEIR FLEET AND REMAINED ON THE COAST ABOUT THREE MONTHS
663-128990-0042 WAITING FOR SOME EXPECTED SPANISH SHIPS WHICH THEY HOPED TO CAPTURE THEY EVENTUALLY MET WITH ONE AND AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF ORDINARY FIGHTING AND STRATAGEM THEY BOARDED AND TOOK HER BUT FOUND HER NOT A VERY VALUABLE PRIZE
663-128990-0043 NOW L'OLONNOIS PROPOSED TO HIS MEN THAT THEY SHOULD SAIL FOR GUATEMALA BUT HE MET WITH AN UNEXPECTED OBSTACLE THE BUCCANEERS WHO HAD ENLISTED UNDER HIM HAD EXPECTED TO MAKE GREAT FORTUNES IN THIS EXPEDITION
663-128990-0044 BUT THEIR HIGH HOPES HAD NOT BEEN REALIZED THEY HAD HAD VERY LITTLE BOOTY AND VERY LITTLE FOOD THEY WERE HUNGRY AND DISAPPOINTED AND WANTED TO GO HOME AND THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THEM DECLINED TO FOLLOW L'OLONNOIS ANY FARTHER
663-128990-0045 BUT THERE WERE SOME WHO DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD RATHER DIE THAN GO HOME TO TORTUGA AS POOR AS WHEN THEY LEFT IT
663-128990-0046 WHICH HE COMMANDED THE SMALLER VESSELS NOW DEPARTED FOR TORTUGA
663-128990-0047 WHEN THEY FOUND IT ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THEIR GREAT VESSEL OFF THE SAND BANKS THE PIRATES SET TO WORK TO BREAK HER UP AND BUILD A BOAT OUT OF HER PLANKS THIS WAS A SERIOUS UNDERTAKING BUT IT WAS ALL THEY COULD DO
663-128990-0048 THEY COULD NOT SWIM AWAY AND THEIR SHIP WAS OF NO USE TO THEM AS SHE WAS BUT WHEN THEY BEGAN TO WORK THEY HAD NO IDEA IT WOULD TAKE SO LONG TO BUILD A BOAT IT WAS SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE THE UNWIELDY CRAFT WAS FINISHED
663-128990-0049 AND THEY OCCUPIED PART OF THE TIME IN GARDENING PLANTING FRENCH BEANS WHICH CAME TO MATURITY IN SIX WEEKS AND GAVE THEM SOME FRESH VEGETABLES
663-128990-0050 AND MADE BREAD FROM SOME WHEAT WHICH WAS AMONG THEIR PROVISIONS THUS MANAGING TO LIVE VERY WELL L'OLONNOIS WAS NEVER INTENDED BY NATURE TO BE A BOAT BUILDER OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT WAS USEFUL AND HONEST AND WHEN THE BOAT WAS FINISHED IT WAS DISCOVERED
663-128990-0051 THAT IT HAD BEEN PLANNED SO BADLY THAT IT WOULD NOT HOLD THEM ALL SO ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO DRAW LOTS TO SEE WHO SHOULD EMBARK IN HER FOR ONE HALF OF THEM WOULD HAVE TO STAY UNTIL THE OTHERS CAME BACK TO RELEASE THEM
663-128990-0052 AND REACHED THE MOUTH OF THE NICARAGUA RIVER THERE HIS PARTY WAS ATTACKED BY SOME SPANIARDS AND INDIANS WHO KILLED MORE THAN HALF OF THEM AND PREVENTED THE OTHERS FROM LANDING
663-128990-0053 AND THEY MIGHT NOW HAVE SAILED BACK TO THE ISLAND WHERE THEY HAD LEFT THEIR COMRADES
663-128990-0054 BUT WENT TO THE COAST OF CARTAGENA THE PIRATES LEFT ON THE ISLAND WERE EVENTUALLY TAKEN OFF BY A BUCCANEERING VESSEL BUT L'OLONNOIS HAD NOW REACHED THE END OF THE STRING BY WHICH THE DEVIL HAD ALLOWED HIM TO GAMBOL ON THIS EARTH FOR SO LONG A TIME
663-128990-0055 BRAVOS OR WILD MEN THESE PEOPLE WOULD NEVER HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE WHITES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONQUER THEM OR TO PACIFY THEM BY KIND TREATMENT THEY HATED THE WHITE MAN AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM
663-128990-0056 THEY HAD HEARD OF L'OLONNOIS AND HIS BUCCANEERS AND WHEN THEY FOUND THIS NOTORIOUS PIRATE UPON THEIR SHORES
663-128990-0057 THESE BLOODY PIRATES HAD ALWAYS CONQUERED IN THEIR DESPERATE FIGHTS BECAUSE THEY WERE SO RECKLESS AND SO SAVAGE BUT NOW THEY HAD FALLEN AMONG THOROUGHBRED SAVAGES MORE CRUEL AND MORE BRUTAL AND PITILESS THAN THEMSELVES
663-128990-0058 NEARLY ALL THE BUCCANEERS WERE KILLED AND L'OLONNOIS WAS TAKEN PRISONER HIS FURIOUS CAPTORS TORE HIS LIVING BODY APART PIECE BY PIECE AND THREW EACH FRAGMENT INTO THE FIRE
663-128990-0059 OF THIS MONSTER IF IN HIS INFANCY HE HAD DIED OF CROUP
