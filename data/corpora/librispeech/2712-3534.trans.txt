2712-3534-0000 PAULA ARRIVES FOR NEARLY A WEEK I COULDN'T THINK OF ANOTHER THING BUT THE COMING OF PAULA MY FATHER HAD GONE TO PARIS HE WOULD BE THERE SOME DAYS TO ARRANGE CERTAIN IMPORTANT MATTERS OF BUSINESS IN CONNECTION WITH HIS FACTORY
2712-3534-0001 AND ALSO TO WAIT FOR THE LITTLE ORPHAN TO BE PLACED IN HIS CARE
2712-3534-0002 IN SCHOOL I TALKED OF NOTHING ELSE IN FACT I TALKED ABOUT HER ALL DAY AND EVERY DAY I LEARNED NOTHING NOR COULD I SEEM TO DO ANYTHING AROUND THE HOUSE
2712-3534-0003 ONE NIGHT WHILE DREAMING I JUMPED FROM THE BED CRYING PAULA PAULA THIS AWAKENED TERESA AND SHE MADE ME TAKE SOME NASTY MEDICINE THINKING I HAD FEVER I MADE PROMISES OF REFORM I WANTED TO BE GOOD
2712-3534-0004 STUDIOUS AND PATIENT IN ORDER TO BE AN EXAMPLE TO PAULA WHO WOULD SEE MY GOOD QUALITIES AND WOULD THUS ENDEAVOR TO IMITATE ME NEVERTHELESS I BECAME ABSOLUTELY INSUFFERABLE MY OLDER SISTERS WITHOUT BEING QUITE SO ENTHUSIASTIC AS I WAS
2712-3534-0005 NEVERTHELESS SPOKE OFTEN OF PAULA CATALINA BEGAN TO WORRY THAT PAULA MIGHT SUFFER IN OUR HOUSE BUT SHE SOON CONSOLED HERSELF BY REMEMBERING THAT MY FATHER HAD PROMISED TO PUT HER OUT TO BOARD IF IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE COULD NOT GET ALONG
2712-3534-0006 AMICABLY WITH US AS TO LOUIS HE SOON SHOWED US THAT HE WAS NOT AT ALL INTERESTED IN THE ARRIVAL OF HIS YOUNG COUSIN
2712-3534-0007 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT BUT A GIRL TERESA SPOKE VERY LITTLE AS TO PAULA BUT I AM PERSUADED THAT LONG BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF OUR LITTLE ORPHAN COUSIN SHE HAD BEEN GIVEN A LARGE PLACE IN OUR OLD SERVANT'S HEART SHE FOUND A LITTLE WHITE BED UP IN THE ATTIC
2712-3534-0008 AT LAST THE GREAT DAY ARRIVED IT WAS A WEDNESDAY
2712-3534-0009 WE DID NOT KNOW AT WHAT HOUR MY FATHER WOULD COME FROM PARIS WITH PAULA AND SO EVERY MOMENT I SAID TO MYSELF PERHAPS THEY HAVE ARRIVED RESULT
2712-3534-0010 TO WORSE BUT AT LAST AT FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON I REACHED THE HOUSE BREATHLESS ONLY TO FIND THAT PAULA HAD NOT YET COME THEY ARE NOT COMING I CRIED IMPATIENTLY I KNEW THEY WOULDN'T BE HERE
2712-3534-0011 THEN WHY DID YOU RUN SO FAST TERESA ASKED I SAID NOTHING BUT SOON ROSA ALSO ARRIVED AND AFTER TEA I PUT ALL MY BOOKS IN ORDER REDRESSED MY DOLLS GOT RID OF THE INK ON MY HANDS WITH PUMICE STONE
2712-3534-0012 AND IN BETWEEN EACH TASK TOOK A TURN IN THE GARDEN ON THE PASSING OF ANY COACH BUT ALWAYS WITH THE SAME RESULT WOULD THEY EVER ARRIVE THEN CAME SUPPER TIME
2712-3534-0013 CATALINA HAD BEEN UP AND DRESSED ALL DAY AND WOULD NOT HEAR OF GOING TO BED UNTIL PAULA CAME
2712-3534-0014 BUT NIGHT HAD ARRIVED THE LAMPS HAD BEEN LIGHTED AND WE HAD RESIGNED OURSELVES TO WAIT WITHOUT THE CONSOLATION OF SEEING THE ROAD FROM THE WINDOW THEN SUDDENLY OH JOY WE HEARD A FAINT SOUND OF WHEELS IN THE DISTANCE THEN CLEARER
2712-3534-0015 AND CLEARER AS THEY RATTLED OVER THE PAVEMENT OF THE DESERTED STREET
2712-3534-0016 I HAD A WILD DESIRE TO RUN OUT IN THE DARK TO RECEIVE MY YOUNG COUSIN FOR WHOM I HAD WAITED ALL THESE WEEKS BUT SOMETHING SEEMED TO DETAIN ME THEN WHILE I WAITED QUESTIONING MYSELF AS TO WHAT I WOULD SAY TO PAULA
2712-3534-0017 TRYING TO REMEMBER ALL THE MANY COUNSELS OF TERESA OUR OLD SERVANT STAGGERED IN FROM THE YARD WITH A GREAT BAG IN EACH HAND THEN OUR FATHER ENTERED WITH A YOUNG GIRL AT HIS SIDE DRESSED IN BLACK PAULA HAD COME
2712-3534-0018 IN ANTICIPATION I HAD FANCIED PAULA AS A PALE SAD LITTLE GIRL WITH BLUE EYES FULL OF TEARS SHE WOULD HAVE GOLDEN HAIR VERY SMOOTH CUT OFF AT THE BASE OF HER EARS
2712-3534-0019 AND WOULD BE DRESSED IN BLACK MUSLIN AND WEAR A STRAW HAT WITH A BLACK RIBBON TIED UNDER HER CHIN BUT HERE WAS A DIFFERENT PAULA SHE WAS LARGE FOR HER AGE AND APPEARED QUITE STRONG HER FRANK OPEN FACE
2712-3534-0020 BRONZED WITH THE SUN AND AIR SHOWED HEALTH AND INTELLIGENCE
2712-3534-0021 WIDE RIBBON OF THE SAME COLOR FAILED TO ENTIRELY HIDE A MAGNIFICENT HEAD OF BROWN HAIR GATHERED BENEATH HER CAP AFTER THE MANNER OF THE WALDENSIANS HER SIMPLE DRESS OF BLACK AND GRAY STRIPES REACHED ALMOST TO HER ANKLES
2712-3534-0022 A BLACK SHAWL WHOSE POINTS PASSED UNDER HER ARMS AND WERE KNOTTED BEHIND PROTECTED HER SHOULDERS WHILE A PAIR OF GREAT THICK SHOES COMPLETED HER ATTIRE IN SPITE OF WHAT TO OUR MIND WAS A CERTAIN QUAINT ODDNESS IN HER DRESS
2712-3534-0023 IT COULD NOT HIDE PAULA'S BEAUTY HER FOREHEAD WAS BROAD AND INTELLIGENT HER LARGE BROWN EYES WERE FULL OF A CERTAIN SWEETNESS AND A LOVELY SMILE PLAYED ON HER HALF OPENED LIPS COME
2712-3534-0024 EMBRACE YOUR YOUNG COUSIN AND GIVE HER A HEARTY WELCOME ROSA CAME FORWARD AND I TIMIDLY DID THE SAME BUT PAULA DROPPING FATHER'S HAND RUSHED TOWARD ROSA AND THEN TO ME
2712-3534-0025 SHE SEEMED TO FORGET HER LONG VOYAGE AND HER WEARINESS AS SHE REPEATED TO EACH ONE OF US IN HER MELODIOUS VOICE I KNOW I SHALL LOVE YOU ALL AND MY UNCLE CHARLES HERE I ALREADY LOVE HIM AND HE HAS TOLD ME ALL YOUR NAMES LET ME SEE
2712-3534-0026 THIS IS ROSA AND THEN TURNING TO ME YOU ARE LISITA OH IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU ALL NOW GO AND GREET YOUR COUSIN CATALINA SAID MY FATHER SHE IS THE SICK ONE HE ADDED SOFTLY
2712-3534-0027 PAULA DREW NEAR THE BIG CHAIR WHERE THE SICK GIRL RE CLINED CATALINA WAS SMILING SADLY AT THE YOUNG STRANGER DO YOU ALSO LOVE ME A LITTLE ASKED MY ELDEST SISTER WITH TENDERNESS AND INFINITE CARE
2712-3534-0028 PAULA ENVELOPED HER IN HER STRONG ARMS I ALREADY LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART SHE SAID LAYING HER HEAD AGAINST CATALINA'S SHOULDER HAVE YOU EVER BEEN SICK PAULA SHE QUESTIONED HER NO BUT PAPA WAS
2712-3534-0029 SHE SAID IN A TREMBLING TONE AT THIS MOMENT TERESA ARRIVED CARRYING IN THE FINAL BAG AT LAST SHE SAID EMBRACING PAULA DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM THEN SEEING THAT PAULA VIEWED HER A BIT STRANGELY SHE ADDED
2712-3534-0030 I AM ONLY OLD TERESA IT WAS I WHO BROUGHT UP YOUR DEAR MOTHER AND I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE TO DO THE SAME WITH YOU BUT IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF YOU WOULDN'T NEED VERY MUCH OF MY CARE YOU ARE SO LARGE AND HEALTHY MUCH BIGGER THAN LISITA HERE
2712-3534-0031 HOW OLD ARE YOU PRAY I AM TEN YEARS OLD MADAME OH DON'T CALL ME MADAME CALL ME TERESA JUST AS YOUR MOTHER DID MANY YEARS AGO AND TERESA TOOK THE LAMP AND BROUGHT IT CLOSE TO PAULA NO
2712-3534-0032 YOU HARDLY HAVE ANY SIMILIARITY IN YOUR FACE BUT YOUR VOICE IS LIKE HERS NOW LET ME HUG YOU ONCE MORE MY TREASURE AND TERESA PRESSED TO HER HEART THE MOTHERLESS CHILD IN MY COUNTRY THEY SAY I AM LIKE PAPA
2712-3534-0033 AND I WILL SHOW IT TO YOU SHOW IT TO US NOW I SHOUTED BUT TERESA INTERRUPTED ME WHAT A CHILD YOU ARE WHEN POOR PAULA IS SO TIRED TOMORROW WILL BE TIME ENOUGH
2712-3534-0034 THE MEAL FOR THE YOUNG TRAVELER HAD BEEN PREPARED ON THE END OF THE GREAT TABLE WHERE TERESA HAD PLACED BUTTERED TOAST AND JAM
2712-3534-0035 THERE YOU ARE PAULA TERESA SAID DRAWING HER TO THE TABLE SIT DOWN AND EAT AND THE OTHERS SAID PAULA LOOKING AT US OH WE ATE LONG AGO SAID ROSA
2712-3534-0036 I THINK WE MIGHT EAT A LITTLE BREAD AND JAM TO ACCOMPANY HER I SAID THEN EVERYBODY LAUGHED I THINK LISITA IS RIGHT FOR ONCE SAID TERESA ALWAYS HAPPY WHEN SHE WAS ABLE TO GIVE US A BIT OF PLEASURE AND I THINK PAULA WILL BE A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE THAT WAY
2712-3534-0037 NOW THEN PAULA ARE YOU NOT HUNGRY ASKED TERESA WITH HER HAND ON THE LOCK OF THE KITCHEN DOOR YES MADAME THAT IS YES TERESA BEGIN THEN LISITA DOESN'T NEED ANY URGING
2712-3534-0038 PAULA LOOKED AT US ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND THEN LOOKED AT TERESA AS IF SHE WOULD SAY SOMETHING AS TERESA REMAINED LOOKING ON IN AN ASTONISHED MANNER
2712-3534-0039 PAULA GOT DOWN FROM HER CHAIR AND STOOD IN FRONT OF HER NOW COOLING CUP OF HOT MILK SHE PLACED HER HANDS TOGETHER CLOSING HER EYES AND BENDING HER HEAD A LITTLE SHE SAID SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY IN A LOW VOICE
2712-3534-0040 THE FOOD WHICH WE RECEIVE O LORD
2712-3534-0041 IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND OF THE SON AND OF THE HOLY GHOST
