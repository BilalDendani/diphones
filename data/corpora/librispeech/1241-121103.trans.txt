1241-121103-0000 THE DARING ATTEMPT TO ROB THE COUNT WAS THE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT PARIS FOR THE NEXT FORTNIGHT THE DYING MAN HAD SIGNED A DEPOSITION DECLARING BENEDETTO TO BE THE ASSASSIN THE POLICE HAD ORDERS TO MAKE THE STRICTEST SEARCH FOR THE MURDERER
1241-121103-0001 THE COUNT TOLD EVERY ONE THAT THIS ADVENTURE HAD HAPPENED DURING HIS ABSENCE AT AUTEUIL
1241-121103-0002 BEING CALLED ON TO PROVE THE CRIME WAS PREPARING HIS BRIEF WITH THE SAME ARDOR THAT HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO EXERCISE WHEN REQUIRED TO SPEAK IN CRIMINAL CASES BUT THREE WEEKS HAD ALREADY PASSED AND THE MOST DILIGENT SEARCH HAD BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL
1241-121103-0003 THE ATTEMPTED ROBBERY AND THE MURDER OF THE ROBBER BY HIS COMRADE WERE ALMOST FORGOTTEN IN ANTICIPATION OF THE APPROACHING MARRIAGE OF MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS TO THE COUNT ANDREA CAVALCANTI IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THIS WEDDING WOULD SHORTLY TAKE PLACE
1241-121103-0004 AS THE YOUNG MAN WAS RECEIVED AT THE BANKER'S AS THE BETROTHED
1241-121103-0005 WHO HIGHLY APPROVED OF THE UNION REGRETTED HIS INABILITY TO LEAVE PARMA AT THAT TIME AND PROMISED A WEDDING GIFT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND LIVRES IT WAS AGREED THAT THE THREE MILLIONS SHOULD BE INTRUSTED TO DANGLARS TO INVEST
1241-121103-0006 SOME PERSONS HAD WARNED THE YOUNG MAN OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS FUTURE FATHER IN LAW WHO HAD OF LATE SUSTAINED REPEATED LOSSES BUT WITH SUBLIME DISINTERESTEDNESS AND CONFIDENCE THE YOUNG MAN REFUSED TO LISTEN
1241-121103-0007 OR TO EXPRESS A SINGLE DOUBT TO THE BARON THE BARON ADORED COUNT ANDREA CAVALCANTI NOT SO MADEMOISELLE EUGENIE DANGLARS WITH AN INSTINCTIVE HATRED OF MATRIMONY SHE SUFFERED ANDREA'S ATTENTIONS IN ORDER TO GET RID OF MORCERF
1241-121103-0008 BUT WHEN ANDREA URGED HIS SUIT SHE BETRAYED AN ENTIRE DISLIKE TO HIM THE BARON MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE PERCEIVED IT BUT ATTRIBUTING IT TO A CAPRICE FEIGNED IGNORANCE THE DELAY DEMANDED BY BEAUCHAMP HAD NEARLY EXPIRED
1241-121103-0009 MORCERF APPRECIATED THE ADVICE OF MONTE CRISTO TO LET THINGS DIE AWAY OF THEIR OWN ACCORD NO ONE HAD TAKEN UP THE REMARK ABOUT THE GENERAL AND NO ONE HAD RECOGNIZED IN THE OFFICER WHO BETRAYED THE CASTLE OF YANINA THE NOBLE COUNT IN THE HOUSE OF PEERS
1241-121103-0010 ALBERT HOWEVER FELT NO LESS INSULTED THE FEW LINES WHICH HAD IRRITATED HIM WERE CERTAINLY INTENDED AS AN INSULT BESIDES
1241-121103-0011 HE CHERISHED THE THOUGHT OF THE DUEL HOPING TO CONCEAL ITS TRUE CAUSE EVEN FROM HIS SECONDS BEAUCHAMP HAD NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE THE DAY HE VISITED ALBERT AND THOSE OF WHOM THE LATTER INQUIRED ALWAYS TOLD HIM HE WAS OUT ON A JOURNEY WHICH WOULD DETAIN HIM SOME DAYS
1241-121103-0012 I WILL FACILITATE IT BY REPEATING THE QUESTION WILL YOU OR WILL YOU NOT RETRACT MORCERF IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO ANSWER YES OR NO TO QUESTIONS WHICH CONCERN THE HONOR THE SOCIAL INTEREST
