161-121897-0000 INDEED SAID I I SEE CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT NEITHER IS INDEPENDENCE TO BE FOUND IN WEALTH NOR POWER IN SOVEREIGNTY NOR REVERENCE IN DIGNITIES NOR FAME IN GLORY NOR TRUE JOY IN PLEASURES
161-121897-0001 I SEEM TO HAVE SOME INKLING BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE AT LARGE FROM THEE WHY TRULY THE REASON IS HARD AT HAND
161-121897-0002 THAT WHICH IS SIMPLE AND INDIVISIBLE BY NATURE HUMAN ERROR SEPARATES AND TRANSFORMS FROM THE TRUE AND PERFECT TO THE FALSE AND IMPERFECT DOST THOU IMAGINE THAT WHICH LACKETH NOTHING CAN WANT POWER
161-121897-0003 CERTAINLY NOT RIGHT FOR IF THERE IS ANY FEEBLENESS OF STRENGTH IN ANYTHING IN THIS THERE MUST NECESSARILY BE NEED OF EXTERNAL PROTECTION THAT IS SO ACCORDINGLY
161-121897-0004 THE NATURE OF INDEPENDENCE AND POWER IS ONE AND THE SAME IT SEEMS SO WELL BUT DOST THINK THAT ANYTHING OF SUCH A NATURE AS THIS CAN BE LOOKED UPON WITH CONTEMPT
161-121897-0005 OR IS IT RATHER OF ALL THINGS MOST WORTHY OF VENERATION NAY THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THAT LET US THEN ADD REVERENCE TO INDEPENDENCE AND POWER
161-121897-0006 AND CONCLUDE THESE THREE TO BE ONE WE MUST IF WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRUTH THINKEST THOU THEN THIS COMBINATION OF QUALITIES TO BE OBSCURE AND WITHOUT DISTINCTION
161-121897-0007 OR RATHER FAMOUS IN ALL RENOWN JUST CONSIDER CAN THAT WANT RENOWN WHICH HAS BEEN AGREED TO BE LACKING IN NOTHING TO BE SUPREME IN POWER
161-121897-0008 AND SO COMES TO APPEAR SOMEWHAT POOR IN ESTEEM I CANNOT BUT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEING WHAT IT IS THIS UNION OF QUALITIES IS ALSO RIGHT FAMOUS IT FOLLOWS THEN
161-121897-0009 THAT WE MUST ADMIT THAT RENOWN IS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER THREE IT DOES SAID I THAT THEN WHICH NEEDS NOTHING OUTSIDE ITSELF WHICH CAN ACCOMPLISH ALL THINGS IN ITS OWN STRENGTH
161-121897-0010 HOW ANY SADNESS CAN FIND ENTRANCE INTO SUCH A STATE WHEREFORE I MUST NEEDS ACKNOWLEDGE IT FULL OF JOY AT LEAST IF OUR FORMER CONCLUSIONS ARE TO HOLD THEN FOR THE SAME REASONS
161-121897-0011 THIS ALSO IS NECESSARY THAT INDEPENDENCE POWER RENOWN REVERENCE AND SWEETNESS OF DELIGHT ARE DIFFERENT ONLY IN NAME BUT IN SUBSTANCE DIFFER NO WISE ONE FROM THE OTHER
161-121897-0012 IT IS SAID I THIS THEN WHICH IS ONE AND SIMPLE BY NATURE HUMAN PERVERSITY SEPARATES AND IN TRYING TO WIN A PART OF THAT WHICH HAS NO PARTS
161-121897-0013 SINCE THERE ARE NO PORTIONS BUT ALSO THE WHOLE TO WHICH IT DOES NOT DREAM OF ASPIRING HOW SO SAID I HE WHO TO ESCAPE WANT SEEKS RICHES GIVES HIMSELF NO CONCERN ABOUT POWER
161-121897-0014 HE PREFERS A MEAN AND LOW ESTATE AND ALSO DENIES HIMSELF MANY PLEASURES DEAR TO NATURE TO AVOID LOSING THE MONEY WHICH HE HAS GAINED BUT AT THIS RATE HE DOES NOT EVEN ATTAIN TO INDEPENDENCE
161-121897-0015 A WEAKLING VOID OF STRENGTH VEXED BY DISTRESSES MEAN AND DESPISED AND BURIED IN OBSCURITY HE AGAIN WHO THIRSTS ALONE FOR POWER SQUANDERS HIS WEALTH
161-121897-0016 AND THINKS FAME AND RANK ALIKE WORTHLESS WITHOUT POWER BUT THOU SEEST IN HOW MANY WAYS HIS STATE ALSO IS DEFECTIVE SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS THAT HE LACKS NECESSARIES
161-121897-0017 AND SINCE HE CANNOT RID HIMSELF OF THESE INCONVENIENCES EVEN CEASES TO HAVE THAT POWER WHICH WAS HIS WHOLE END AND AIM IN LIKE MANNER MAY WE CAST UP THE RECKONING IN CASE OF RANK
161-121897-0018 OF GLORY OR OF PLEASURE FOR SINCE EACH ONE OF THESE SEVERALLY IS IDENTICAL WITH THE REST WHOSOEVER SEEKS ANY ONE OF THEM WITHOUT THE OTHERS
161-121897-0019 DOES NOT EVEN LAY HOLD OF THAT ONE WHICH HE MAKES HIS AIM WELL SAID I WHAT THEN SUPPOSE ANYONE DESIRE TO OBTAIN THEM TOGETHER
161-121897-0020 HE DOES INDEED WISH FOR HAPPINESS AS A WHOLE BUT WILL HE FIND IT IN THESE THINGS WHICH AS WE HAVE PROVED
161-121897-0021 NAY BY NO MEANS SAID I THEN HAPPINESS MUST CERTAINLY NOT BE SOUGHT IN THESE THINGS WHICH SEVERALLY ARE BELIEVED TO AFFORD SOME ONE OF THE BLESSINGS MOST TO BE DESIRED THEY MUST NOT I ADMIT
161-121897-0022 NO CONCLUSION COULD BE MORE TRUE SO THEN THE FORM AND THE CAUSES OF FALSE HAPPINESS ARE SET BEFORE THINE EYES NOW TURN THY GAZE TO THE OTHER SIDE THERE
161-121897-0023 THOU WILT STRAIGHTWAY SEE THE TRUE HAPPINESS I PROMISED
161-121897-0024 TIS PLAIN TO THE BLIND SAID I THOU DIDST POINT IT OUT EVEN NOW IN SEEKING TO UNFOLD THE CAUSES OF THE FALSE
161-121897-0025 THAT IS TRUE AND PERFECT HAPPINESS WHICH CROWNS ONE WITH THE UNION OF INDEPENDENCE POWER REVERENCE RENOWN AND JOY AND TO PROVE TO THEE WITH HOW DEEP AN INSIGHT I HAVE LISTENED SINCE ALL THESE ARE THE SAME
161-121897-0026 THAT WHICH CAN TRULY BESTOW ONE OF THEM I KNOW TO BE WITHOUT DOUBT FULL AND COMPLETE HAPPINESS HAPPY ART THOU MY SCHOLAR IN THIS THY CONVICTION ONLY ONE THING SHOULDST THOU ADD
161-121897-0027 WHAT IS THAT SAID I IS THERE AUGHT THINKEST THOU AMID THESE MORTAL AND PERISHABLE THINGS WHICH CAN PRODUCE A STATE SUCH AS THIS NAY SURELY NOT
161-121897-0028 AND THIS THOU HAST SO AMPLY DEMONSTRATED THAT NO WORD MORE IS NEEDED WELL THEN THESE THINGS SEEM TO GIVE TO MORTALS SHADOWS OF THE TRUE GOOD OR SOME KIND OF IMPERFECT GOOD
161-121897-0029 BUT THE TRUE AND PERFECT GOOD THEY CANNOT BESTOW EVEN SO SAID I SINCE THEN THOU HAST LEARNT WHAT THAT TRUE HAPPINESS IS AND WHAT MEN FALSELY CALL HAPPINESS
161-121897-0030 IT NOW REMAINS THAT THOU SHOULDST LEARN FROM WHAT SOURCE TO SEEK THIS YES TO THIS I HAVE LONG BEEN EAGERLY LOOKING FORWARD WELL SINCE AS PLATO MAINTAINS IN THE TIMAEUS
161-121897-0031 WE OUGHT EVEN IN THE MOST TRIVIAL MATTERS TO IMPLORE THE DIVINE PROTECTION WHAT THINKEST THOU SHOULD WE NOW DO IN ORDER TO DESERVE TO FIND THE SEAT OF THAT HIGHEST GOOD
161-121897-0032 WE MUST INVOKE THE FATHER OF ALL THINGS SAID I FOR WITHOUT THIS NO ENTERPRISE SETS OUT FROM A RIGHT BEGINNING
161-121897-0033 AND FORTHWITH LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND SANG
161-121897-0034 TO ALL THAT MOVES THE SOURCE OF MOVEMENT FIXED THYSELF AND MOVELESS THEE NO CAUSE IMPELLED EXTRINSIC THIS PROPORTIONED FRAME TO SHAPE FROM SHAPELESS MATTER
161-121897-0035 BUT DEEP SET WITHIN THY INMOST BEING THE FORM OF PERFECT GOOD FROM ENVY FREE AND THOU DIDST MOULD THE WHOLE TO THAT SUPERNAL PATTERN BEAUTEOUS THE WORLD IN THEE THUS IMAGED
161-121897-0036 BEING THYSELF MOST BEAUTIFUL SO THOU THE WORK DIDST FASHION IN THAT FAIR LIKENESS BIDDING IT PUT ON PERFECTION THROUGH THE EXQUISITE PERFECTNESS OF EVERY PART'S CONTRIVANCE
161-121897-0037 OR WEIGHT OF WATERS WHELM THE EARTH THOU JOINEST AND DIFFUSEST THROUGH THE WHOLE LINKING ACCORDANTLY ITS SEVERAL PARTS A SOUL OF THREEFOLD NATURE MOVING ALL
161-121897-0038 THIS CLEFT IN TWAIN AND IN TWO CIRCLES GATHERED SPEEDS IN A PATH THAT ON ITSELF RETURNS ENCOMPASSING MIND'S LIMITS AND CONFORMS THE HEAVENS TO HER TRUE SEMBLANCE
161-121897-0039 EACH TO ITS STARRY CAR AFFIXING
161-121897-0040 THESE BY A LAW BENIGN THOU BIDDEST TURN AGAIN
161-121897-0041 AND SHINE IN THINE OWN SPLENDOUR
