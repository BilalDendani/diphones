1166-14986-0000 A HARMLESS DECEPTION MISS MARGARET GOODWIN'S NARRATIVE CONTINUED THEY SAY THAT EVERYONE IS CAPABLE OF ONE NOVEL AND IN MY OPINION MOST PEOPLE COULD WRITE ONE PLAY WHETHER I WROTE MINE IN AN INSPIRATION OF DESPAIR I CANNOT SAY
1166-14986-0001 I WROTE IT THREE YEARS HAD PASSED AND JAMES WAS STILL HAGGLING WITH THOSE WHO BUY MEN'S BRAINS HIS EARNINGS WERE ENOUGH JUST TO KEEP HIS HEAD ABOVE WATER BUT NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE US TWO ONE PERHAPS BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS CLEAR AND EASY FOR US NOW
1166-14986-0002 I AM GRADUALLY LOSING A PROPER APPRECIATION OF HIS STRUGGLE THAT SHOULD NEVER BE HE DID NOT WIN BUT HE DID NOT LOSE WHICH MEANS NEARLY AS MUCH
1166-14986-0003 SO MY MOTHER HAS TOLD ME IN MODERN JOURNALISTIC LONDON AND I KNOW THAT HE WOULD HAVE WON
1166-14986-0004 WHAT HE WENT THROUGH WHILE TRYING WITH HIS PEN TO MAKE A LIVING FOR HIMSELF AND ME I LEARNED FROM HIS LETTERS LONDON HE WROTE IS NOT PAVED WITH GOLD BUT IN LITERARY FIELDS THERE ARE NUGGETS TO BE HAD BY THE LIGHTEST SCRATCHING AND THOSE NUGGETS ARE PLAYS
1166-14986-0005 A SUCCESSFUL PLAY GIVES YOU MONEY AND A NAME AUTOMATICALLY WHAT THE ORDINARY WRITER MAKES IN A YEAR THE SUCCESSFUL DRAMATIST RECEIVES WITHOUT LABOUR IN A FORTNIGHT
1166-14986-0006 SOME MEN HE SAID HAVE SOME OF THE QUALIFICATIONS WHILE FALLING SHORT OF THE OTHERS THEY HAVE A SENSE OF SITUATION WITHOUT THE NECESSARY TRICKS OF TECHNIQUE OR THEY SACRIFICE PLOT TO ATMOSPHERE OR ATMOSPHERE TO PLOT
1166-14986-0007 I WORSE LUCK HAVE NOT ONE SINGLE QUALIFICATION THE NURSING OF A CLIMAX THE TREMENDOUS OMISSIONS IN THE DIALOGUE THE KNACK OF STAGE CHARACTERISATION ALL THESE THINGS ARE IN SOME INEXPLICABLE WAY OUTSIDE ME
1166-14986-0008 IT WAS THIS LETTER THAT SET ME THINKING EVER SINCE JAMES HAD LEFT THE ISLAND I HAD BEEN CHAFING AT THE HELPLESSNESS OF MY POSITION
1166-14986-0009 NOTHING I SUPPOSE I HELPED HIM IN A WAY THE THOUGHT OF ME WOULD BE WITH HIM ALWAYS SPURRING HIM ON TO WORK THAT THE TIME OF OUR SEPARATION MIGHT BE LESS BUT IT WAS NOT ENOUGH I WANTED TO BE DOING SOMETHING
1166-14986-0010 AND IT WAS DURING THESE RESTLESS WEEKS THAT I WROTE MY PLAY I THINK NOTHING WILL EVER ERASE FROM MY MIND THE MOMENT WHEN THE CENTRAL IDEA OF THE GIRL WHO WAITED CAME TO ME IT WAS A BOISTEROUS OCTOBER EVENING THE WIND HAD BEEN RISING ALL DAY
1166-14986-0011 NOW THE BRANCHES OF THE LILAC WERE DANCING IN THE RUSH OF THE STORM AND FAR OUT IN THE BAY ONE COULD SEE THE WHITE CRESTS OF THE WAVES GLEAMING THROUGH THE GROWING DARKNESS WE HAD JUST FINISHED TEA THE LAMP WAS LIT IN OUR LITTLE DRAWING ROOM AND ON THE SOFA
1166-14986-0012 SO PLACED THAT THE LIGHT FELL OVER HER LEFT SHOULDER IN THE MANNER RECOMMENDED BY OCULISTS SAT MY MOTHER WITH SCHOPENHAUER'S ART OF LITERATURE PONTO SLEPT ON THE RUG SOMETHING IN THE UNRUFFLED PEACE OF THE SCENE TORE AT MY NERVES
1166-14986-0013 I HAVE SELDOM FELT SO RESTLESS IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE STORM THAT MADE ME SO I THINK MYSELF THAT IT WAS JAMES'S LETTER THE BOAT HAD BEEN LATE THAT MORNING OWING TO THE WEATHER AND I HAD NOT RECEIVED THE LETTER TILL AFTER LUNCH
1166-14986-0014 I LISTENED TO THE HOWL OF THE WIND AND LONGED TO BE OUT IN IT MY MOTHER LOOKED AT ME OVER HER BOOK YOU ARE RESTLESS MARGIE SHE SAID THERE IS A VOLUME OF MARCUS AURELIUS ON THE TABLE BESIDE YOU IF YOU CARE TO READ
1166-14986-0015 NO THANK YOU MOTHER I SAID I THINK I SHALL GO FOR A WALK WRAP UP WELL MY DEAR SHE REPLIED SHE THEN RESUMED HER BOOK I WENT OUT OF OUR LITTLE GARDEN AND STOOD ON THE CLIFF THE WIND FLEW AT ME LIKE SOME WILD THING
1166-14986-0016 SPRAY STUNG MY FACE I WAS FILLED WITH A WILD EXHILARATION AND THEN THE IDEA CAME TO ME THE SIMPLEST MOST DRAMATIC IDEA QUAINT WHIMSICAL
1166-14986-0017 THE CENTRAL IDEA TO BE BRIEF OF THE GIRL WHO WAITED OF MY MAENAD TRAMP ALONG THE CLIFF TOP WITH MY BRAIN AFIRE AND MY RETURN DRAGGLED AND DRIPPING AN HOUR LATE FOR DINNER OF MY WRITING AND RE WRITING
1166-14986-0018 OF MY TEARS AND BLACK DEPRESSION OF THE PENS I WORE OUT AND THE QUIRES OF PAPER I SPOILED AND FINALLY OF THE ECSTASY OF THE DAY WHEN THE PIECE BEGAN TO MOVE AND THE CHARACTERS TO LIVE I NEED NOT SPEAK ANYONE WHO HAS EVER WRITTEN WILL KNOW THE SENSATIONS
1166-14986-0019 JAMES MUST HAVE GONE THROUGH A HUNDRED TIMES WHAT I WENT THROUGH ONCE
1166-14986-0020 FOR TWO DAYS I GLOATED ALONE OVER THE GREAT PILE OF MANUSCRIPT THEN I WENT TO MY MOTHER MY DIFFIDENCE WAS EXQUISITE IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO TELL HER THE NATURE OF MY REQUEST WHEN I SPOKE TO HER AFTER LUNCH
1166-14986-0021 AT LAST SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT I HAD WRITTEN A PLAY AND WISHED TO READ IT TO HER SHE TOOK ME TO THE BOW WINDOW WITH GENTLE SOLICITUDE AND WAITED FOR ME TO PROCEED AT FIRST SHE ENCOURAGED ME FOR I FALTERED OVER MY OPENING WORDS
1166-14986-0022 BUT AS I WARMED TO MY WORK AND AS MY EMBARRASSMENT LEFT ME SHE NO LONGER SPOKE HER EYES WERE FIXED INTENTLY UPON THE BLUE SPACE BEYOND THE LILAC I READ ON AND ON TILL AT LENGTH MY VOICE TRAILED OVER THE LAST LINE
1166-14986-0023 ROSE GALLANTLY AT THE LAST FENCE THE SINGLE WORD CURTAIN AND ABRUPTLY BROKE THE STRAIN HAD BEEN TOO MUCH FOR ME
1166-14986-0024 AND QUIETLY WITH CLOSED EYELIDS I LAY THERE UNTIL IN THE SOFT COOL OF THE EVENING I ASKED FOR HER VERDICT SEEING AS SHE DID INSTANTLY THAT IT WOULD BE MORE DANGEROUS TO DENY MY REQUEST THAN TO ACCEDE TO IT SHE SPOKE
1166-14986-0025 THAT THERE IS AN ABSENCE MY DEAR MARGIE OF ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH LIFE THAT NOT A SINGLE CHARACTER IS IN ANY DEGREE HUMAN THAT PASSION AND VIRTUE AND VICE AND REAL FEELING ARE WANTING THIS SURPRISES ME MORE THAN I CAN TELL YOU
1166-14986-0026 I HAD EXPECTED TO LISTEN TO A NATURAL ORDINARY UNACTABLE EPISODE ARRANGED MORE OR LESS IN STEICHOMUTHICS THERE IS NO WORK SO SCHOLARLY AND ENGAGING AS THE AMATEUR'S
1166-14986-0027 BUT IN YOUR PLAY I AM AMAZED TO FIND THE TOUCH OF THE PROFESSIONAL AND EXPERIENCED PLAYWRIGHT YES MY DEAR YOU HAVE PROVED THAT YOU HAPPEN TO POSSESS THE QUALITY ONE THAT IS MOST DIFFICULT TO ACQUIRE OF SURROUNDING A SITUATION WHICH IS IMPROBABLE ENOUGH
1166-14986-0028 AS YOUR MOTHER I AM DISAPPOINTED I HAD HOPED FOR ORIGINALITY AS YOUR LITERARY WELL WISHER I STIFLE MY MATERNAL FEELINGS AND CONGRATULATE YOU UNRESERVEDLY I THANKED MY MOTHER EFFUSIVELY I THINK I CRIED A LITTLE
1166-14986-0029 SHE SAID AFFECTIONATELY THAT THE HOUR HAD BEEN ONE OF GREAT INTEREST TO HER
1166-14986-0030 SHE THEN RESUMED HER BOOK I WENT TO MY ROOM AND RE READ THE LAST LETTER I HAD HAD FROM JAMES THE BARREL CLUB COVENT GARDEN LONDON MY DARLING MARGIE
1166-14986-0031 I AM WRITING THIS LINE SIMPLY AND SOLELY FOR THE SELFISH PLEASURE I GAIN FROM THE ACT OF WRITING TO YOU I KNOW EVERYTHING WILL COME RIGHT SOME TIME OR OTHER BUT AT PRESENT I AM SUFFERING FROM A BAD ATTACK OF THE BLUES I AM LIKE A GENERAL WHO HAS PLANNED OUT A BRILLIANT ATTACK
1166-14986-0032 AND REALISES THAT HE MUST FAIL FOR WANT OF SUFFICIENT TROOPS TO CARRY A POSITION ON THE TAKING OF WHICH THE WHOLE SUCCESS OF THE ASSAULT DEPENDS BRIEFLY MY POSITION IS LIKE THIS
1166-14986-0033 MY NAME IS PRETTY WELL KNOWN IN A SMALL SORT OF WAY AMONG EDITORS AND THE LIKE AS THAT OF A MAN WHO CAN TURN OUT FAIRLY GOOD STUFF BESIDES THIS I HAVE MANY INFLUENTIAL FRIENDS YOU SEE WHERE THIS BRINGS ME
1166-14986-0034 I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF MY ATTACKING MOVEMENT AND I HAVE NOT BEEN BEATEN BACK BUT THE KEY TO THE ENEMY'S POSITION IS STILL UNCAPTURED YOU KNOW WHAT THIS KEY IS FROM MY OTHER LETTERS IT'S THE STAGE
1166-14986-0035 AH MARGIE ONE ACTING PLAY ONLY ONE IT WOULD MEAN EVERYTHING APART FROM THE ACTUAL TRIUMPH AND THE DIRECT PROFITS IT WOULD BRING SO MUCH WITH IT
1166-14986-0036 I SHOULD HAVE AN ACCEPTED POSITION IN THE LITERARY WORLD WHICH WOULD CONVERT ALL THE OTHER AVENUES TO WEALTH ON WHICH I HAVE MY EYE INSTANTLY INTO ROYAL ROADS OBSTACLES WOULD VANISH
1166-14986-0037 THE FACT THAT I WAS A SUCCESSFUL PLAYWRIGHT WOULD MAKE THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE SORT OF WORK I AM DOING NOW INEVITABLE AND I SHOULD GET PAID TEN TIMES AS WELL FOR IT AND IT WOULD MEAN WELL YOU KNOW WHAT IT WOULD MEAN DON'T YOU DARLING MARGIE TELL ME AGAIN THAT I HAVE YOUR LOVE
1166-14986-0038 THAT THE WAITING IS NOT TOO HARD THAT YOU BELIEVE IN ME DEAREST IT WILL COME RIGHT IN THE END NOTHING CAN PREVENT THAT LOVE AND THE WILL OF A MAN HAVE ALWAYS BEATEN TIME AND FATE WRITE TO ME DEAR EVER YOUR DEVOTED JAMES
1166-14986-0039 HOW UTTERLY FREE FROM THOUGHT OF SELF HIS MAGNIFICENT LOYALTY FORGOT THE DREADFUL TENSION OF HIS OWN GREAT BATTLE AND PICTURED ONLY THE TEDIUM OF WAITING WHICH IT WAS MY PART TO ENDURE I FINISHED MY LETTER TO JAMES VERY LATE THAT NIGHT
1166-14986-0040 IT WAS A VERY LONG AND EXPLANATORY LETTER AND IT ENCLOSED MY PLAY THE MAIN POINT I AIMED AT WAS NOT TO DAMP HIS SPIRITS HE WOULD I KNEW WELL SEE THAT THE PLAY WAS SUITABLE FOR STAGING
1166-14986-0041 HE WOULD IN SHORT SEE THAT I AN INEXPERIENCED GIRL HAD DONE WHAT HE A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL WRITER HAD FAILED TO DO LEST THEREFORE HIS PIQUE SHOULD KILL ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE WHEN HE RECEIVED MY WORK I WROTE AS ONE BEGGING A FAVOUR

1166-14986-0044 YOU KNOW THE RIGHT MEN TO GO TO TO APPROACH THEM ON BEHALF OF A STRANGER'S WORK IS FAR LESS LIKELY TO LEAD TO SUCCESS I HAVE ASSUMED YOU WILL SEE THAT THE PLAY IS CERTAIN TO BE PRODUCED BUT THAT WILL ONLY BE SO IF YOU ADOPT IT AS YOUR OWN
