1316-132782-0000 IN THE SUMMER OF THE YEAR SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE ARCHBISHOPRIC BECAME VACANT FURSTEMBURG WAS THE CANDIDATE OF THE HOUSE OF BOURBON THE ENEMIES OF THAT HOUSE PROPOSED THE YOUNG PRINCE CLEMENT OF BAVARIA FURSTEMBURG WAS ALREADY A BISHOP
1316-132782-0001 TWO THIRDS OF THE CHAPTER OF COLOGNE SHOULD JOIN THE POPE WOULD GRANT NO DISPENSATION TO A CREATURE OF FRANCE THE EMPEROR INDUCED MORE THAN A THIRD PART OF THE CHAPTER TO VOTE FOR THE BAVARIAN PRINCE MEANWHILE
1316-132782-0002 MUNSTER AND HILDESHEIM THE MAJORITY WAS ADVERSE TO FRANCE LEWIS SAW WITH INDIGNATION AND ALARM
1316-132782-0003 BUT HOSTILE TO HIM IN A PAPER WRITTEN WITH GREAT ACRIMONY HE COMPLAINED OF THE INJUSTICE WITH WHICH FRANCE WAS ON ALL OCCASIONS TREATED BY THAT SEE WHICH OUGHT TO EXTEND A PARENTAL PROTECTION
1316-132782-0004 BY INSULTING THE HOLY SEE THESE FAULTS HE COMMITTED AT A CONJUNCTURE AT WHICH NO FAULT COULD BE COMMITTED WITH IMPUNITY AND UNDER THE EYE OF AN OPPONENT SECOND IN VIGILANCE SAGACITY AND ENERGY TO NO STATESMAN WHOSE MEMORY HISTORY HAS PRESERVED
1316-132782-0005 WILLIAM SAW WITH STERN DELIGHT HIS ADVERSARIES TOILING TO CLEAR AWAY OBSTACLE AFTER OBSTACLE FROM HIS PATH WHILE THEY RAISED AGAINST THEMSELVES THE ENMITY OF ALL SECTS HE LABOURED TO CONCILIATE ALL
1316-132782-0006 THE GREAT DESIGN WHICH HE MEDITATED HE WITH EXQUISITE SKILL PRESENTED TO DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS IN DIFFERENT LIGHTS AND IT MUST BE ADDED THAT THOUGH THOSE LIGHTS WERE DIFFERENT NONE OF THEM WAS FALSE HE CALLED ON THE PRINCES OF NORTHERN GERMANY
1316-132782-0007 TO RALLY ROUND HIM IN DEFENCE OF THE COMMON CAUSE OF ALL REFORMED CHURCHES
1316-132782-0008 OF THE BRITISH ROMAN CATHOLICS WAS THAT SHORTSIGHTED AND HEADSTRONG MONARCH WHO WHEN HE MIGHT EASILY HAVE OBTAINED FOR THEM A LEGAL TOLERATION HAD TRAMPLED ON LAW LIBERTY PROPERTY IN ORDER TO RAISE THEM TO AN ODIOUS AND PRECARIOUS ASCENDENCY
1316-132782-0009 IF THE MISGOVERNMENT OF JAMES WERE SUFFERED TO CONTINUE IT MUST PRODUCE AT NO REMOTE TIME A POPULAR OUTBREAK WHICH MIGHT BE FOLLOWED BY A BARBAROUS PERSECUTION OF THE PAPISTS THE PRINCE DECLARED THAT TO AVERT THE HORRORS OF SUCH A PERSECUTION WAS ONE OF HIS CHIEF OBJECTS
1316-132782-0010 IF HE SUCCEEDED IN HIS DESIGN HE WOULD USE THE POWER WHICH HE MUST THEN POSSESS AS HEAD OF THE PROTESTANT INTEREST TO PROTECT THE MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH OF ROME PERHAPS THE PASSIONS EXCITED BY THE TYRANNY OF JAMES MIGHT MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EFFACE THE PENAL LAWS FROM THE STATUTE BOOK
1316-132782-0011 BUT THOSE LAWS SHOULD BE MITIGATED BY A LENIENT ADMINISTRATION NO CLASS WOULD REALLY GAIN MORE BY THE PROPOSED EXPEDITION THAN THOSE PEACEABLE AND UNAMBITIOUS ROMAN CATHOLICS WHO MERELY WISHED TO FOLLOW THEIR CALLINGS AND TO WORSHIP THEIR MAKER WITHOUT MOLESTATION
1316-132782-0012 THE ONLY LOSERS WOULD BE THE TYRCONNELS THE DOVERS THE ALBEVILLES AND THE OTHER POLITICAL ADVENTURERS WHO IN RETURN FOR FLATTERY AND EVIL COUNSEL HAD OBTAINED FROM THEIR CREDULOUS MASTER GOVERNMENTS REGIMENTS AND EMBASSIES
1316-132782-0013 WHILE WILLIAM EXERTED HIMSELF TO ENLIST ON HIS SIDE THE SYMPATHIES BOTH OF PROTESTANTS AND OF ROMAN CATHOLICS HE EXERTED HIMSELF WITH NOT LESS VIGOUR AND PRUDENCE TO PROVIDE THE MILITARY MEANS WHICH HIS UNDERTAKING REQUIRED
1316-132782-0014 HE COULD NOT MAKE A DESCENT ON ENGLAND WITHOUT THE SANCTION OF THE UNITED PROVINCES IF HE ASKED FOR THAT SANCTION BEFORE HIS DESIGN WAS RIPE FOR EXECUTION HIS INTENTIONS MIGHT POSSIBLY BE THWARTED BY THE FACTION HOSTILE TO HIS HOUSE AND WOULD CERTAINLY BE DIVULGED TO THE WHOLE WORLD
1316-132782-0015 HE THEREFORE DETERMINED TO MAKE HIS PREPARATIONS WITH ALL SPEED AND WHEN THEY WERE COMPLETE TO SEIZE SOME FAVOURABLE MOMENT FOR REQUESTING THE CONSENT OF THE FEDERATION IT WAS OBSERVED BY THE AGENTS OF FRANCE THAT HE WAS MORE BUSY THAN THEY HAD EVER KNOWN HIM
1316-132782-0016 NOT A DAY PASSED ON WHICH HE WAS NOT SEEN SPURRING FROM HIS VILLA TO THE HAGUE HE WAS PERPETUALLY CLOSETED WITH HIS MOST DISTINGUISHED ADHERENTS TWENTY FOUR SHIPS OF WAR WERE FITTED OUT FOR SEA IN ADDITION TO THE ORDINARY FORCE WHICH THE COMMONWEALTH MAINTAINED
1316-132782-0017 THERE WAS AS IT CHANCED AN EXCELLENT PRETENCE FOR MAKING THIS ADDITION TO THE MARINE FOR SOME ALGERINE CORSAIRS HAD RECENTLY DARED TO SHOW THEMSELVES IN THE GERMAN OCEAN A CAMP WAS FORMED NEAR NIMEGUEN MANY THOUSANDS OF TROOPS WERE ASSEMBLED THERE
1316-132782-0018 IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THIS ARMY THE GARRISONS WERE WITHDRAWN FROM THE STRONGHOLDS IN DUTCH BRABANT EVEN THE RENOWNED FORTRESS OF BERGOPZOOM WAS LEFT ALMOST DEFENCELESS FIELD PIECES
1316-132782-0019 BOMBS AND TUMBRELS FROM ALL THE MAGAZINES OF THE UNITED PROVINCES WERE COLLECTED AT THE HEAD QUARTERS ALL THE BAKERS OF ROTTERDAM TOILED DAY AND NIGHT TO MAKE BISCUIT ALL THE GUNMAKERS OF UTRECHT WERE FOUND TOO FEW TO EXECUTE THE ORDERS FOR PISTOLS AND MUSKETS
1316-132782-0020 THEY COULD NOT INDEED BE FORMALLY ENLISTED WITHOUT THE SANCTION OF THE FEDERATION BUT THEY WERE WELL DRILLED AND KEPT IN SUCH A STATE OF DISCIPLINE THAT THEY MIGHT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BE DISTRIBUTED INTO REGIMENTS WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THAT SANCTION SHOULD BE OBTAINED
1316-132782-0021 THESE PREPARATIONS REQUIRED READY MONEY BUT WILLIAM HAD BY STRICT ECONOMY LAID UP AGAINST A GREAT EMERGENCY A TREASURE AMOUNTING TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS STERLING WHAT MORE WAS WANTING WAS SUPPLIED BY THE ZEAL OF HIS PARTISANS
1316-132782-0022 GREAT QUANTITIES OF GOLD NOT LESS IT WAS SAID THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND GUINEAS CAME TO HIM FROM ENGLAND
1316-132782-0023 AND TRELAWNEY BISHOP OF BRISTOL HAD DURING THEIR RESIDENCE IN THE TOWER RECONSIDERED THE DOCTRINE OF NONRESISTANCE AND WERE READY TO WELCOME AN ARMED DELIVERER A BROTHER OF THE BISHOP OF BRISTOL COLONEL CHARLES TRELAWNEY
1316-132782-0024 WHO COMMANDED ONE OF THE TANGIER REGIMENTS NOW KNOWN AS THE FOURTH OF THE LINE SIGNIFIED HIS READINESS TO DRAW HIS SWORD FOR THE PROTESTANT RELIGION SIMILAR ASSURANCES ARRIVED FROM THE SAVAGE KIRKE CHURCHILL
1316-132782-0025 IN A LETTER WRITTEN WITH A CERTAIN ELEVATION OF LANGUAGE WHICH WAS THE SURE MARK THAT HE WAS GOING TO COMMIT A BASENESS DECLARED THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO PERFORM HIS DUTY TO HEAVEN AND TO HIS COUNTRY AND THAT HE PUT HIS HONOUR ABSOLUTELY INTO THE HANDS OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE
1316-132782-0026 WILLIAM DOUBTLESS READ THESE WORDS WITH ONE OF THOSE BITTER AND CYNICAL SMILES WHICH GAVE HIS FACE ITS LEAST PLEASING EXPRESSION
1316-132782-0027 WILLIAM FIRST RECEIVED ASSURANCES OF SUPPORT FROM A VERY DIFFERENT QUARTER THE HISTORY OF SUNDERLAND'S INTRIGUES IS COVERED WITH AN OBSCURITY WHICH IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT ANY INQUIRER WILL EVER SUCCEED IN PENETRATING BUT
1316-132782-0028 THOUGH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCOVER THE WHOLE TRUTH IT IS EASY TO DETECT SOME PALPABLE FICTIONS THE JACOBITES FOR OBVIOUS REASONS AFFIRMED THAT THE REVOLUTION OF SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WAS THE RESULT OF A PLOT CONCERTED LONG BEFORE
1316-132782-0029 SUNDERLAND THEY REPRESENTED AS THE CHIEF CONSPIRATOR HE HAD THEY AVERRED IN PURSUANCE OF HIS GREAT DESIGN INCITED HIS TOO CONFIDING MASTER TO DISPENSE WITH STATUTES TO CREATE AN ILLEGAL TRIBUNAL
1316-132782-0030 TO CONFISCATE FREEHOLD PROPERTY AND TO SEND THE FATHERS OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH TO A PRISON THIS ROMANCE RESTS ON NO EVIDENCE AND THOUGH IT HAS BEEN REPEATED DOWN TO OUR OWN TIME SEEMS HARDLY TO DESERVE CONFUTATION
1316-132782-0031 NO FACT IS MORE CERTAIN THAN THAT SUNDERLAND OPPOSED SOME OF THE MOST IMPRUDENT STEPS WHICH JAMES TOOK AND IN PARTICULAR THE PROSECUTION OF THE BISHOPS WHICH REALLY BROUGHT ON THE DECISIVE CRISIS BUT EVEN IF THIS FACT WERE NOT ESTABLISHED
1316-132782-0032 THERE WOULD STILL REMAIN ONE ARGUMENT SUFFICIENT TO DECIDE THE CONTROVERSY WHAT CONCEIVABLE MOTIVE HAD SUNDERLAND TO WISH FOR A REVOLUTION UNDER THE EXISTING SYSTEM HE WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF DIGNITY AND PROSPERITY
1316-132782-0033 AS PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL HE TOOK PRECEDENCE OF THE WHOLE TEMPORAL PEERAGE AS PRINCIPAL SECRETARY OF STATE HE WAS THE MOST ACTIVE AND POWERFUL MEMBER OF THE CABINET
1316-132782-0034 WAS A VERY SMALL PART OF WHAT HE RECEIVED FROM FRANCE ALONE HE DREW A REGULAR STIPEND OF NEAR SIX THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR BESIDES LARGE OCCASIONAL GRATUITIES HE HAD BARGAINED WITH TYRCONNEL FOR FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR
1316-132782-0035 OR FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS DOWN FROM IRELAND WHAT SUMS HE MADE BY SELLING PLACES TITLES AND PARDONS CAN ONLY BE CONJECTURED BUT MUST HAVE BEEN ENORMOUS JAMES SEEMED TO TAKE A PLEASURE IN LOADING WITH WEALTH ONE WHOM HE REGARDED
1316-132782-0036 AS HIS OWN CONVERT ALL FINES ALL FORFEITURES WENT TO SUNDERLAND ON EVERY GRANT TOLL WAS PAID TO HIM
1316-132782-0037 THE ANSWER WAS HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO MY LORD PRESIDENT ONE BOLD MAN VENTURED TO SAY THAT THE LORD PRESIDENT GOT ALL THE MONEY OF THE COURT WELL REPLIED HIS MAJESTY
1316-132782-0038 AND IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT FORTUNES OF THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR WERE IN HIS TIME RARER THAN FORTUNES OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR NOW ARE
1316-132782-0039 WHAT CHANCE WAS THERE THAT IN A NEW ORDER OF THINGS A MAN SO DEEPLY IMPLICATED IN ILLEGAL AND UNPOPULAR ACTS A MEMBER OF THE HIGH COMMISSION A RENEGADE WHOM THE MULTITUDE IN PLACES OF GENERAL RESORT PURSUED WITH THE CRY OF POPISH DOG
1316-132782-0040 WOULD BE GREATER AND RICHER WHAT CHANCE THAT HE WOULD EVEN BE ABLE TO ESCAPE CONDIGN PUNISHMENT HE HAD UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN LONG IN THE HABIT OF LOOKING FORWARD TO THE TIME WHEN WILLIAM AND MARY MIGHT BE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF NATURE AND LAW
1316-132782-0041 SCARCELY HOWEVER HAD HE BY THAT INEXPIABLE CRIME MADE HIMSELF AN OBJECT OF HATRED AND CONTEMPT TO THE WHOLE NATION
1316-132782-0042 THE LOSS OF HIS PLACES HIS SALARIES HIS PENSIONS WAS THE LEAST THAT HE HAD TO DREAD HIS PATRIMONIAL MANSION AMID WOODS AT ALTHORPE MIGHT BE CONFISCATED HE MIGHT LIE MANY YEARS IN A PRISON HE MIGHT END HIS DAYS IN A FOREIGN LAND
1316-132782-0043 A PENSIONER ON THE BOUNTY OF FRANCE EVEN THIS WAS NOT THE WORST VISIONS OF AN INNUMERABLE CROWD COVERING TOWER HILL AND SHOUTING WITH SAVAGE JOY AT THE SIGHT OF THE APOSTATE OF A SCAFFOLD HUNG WITH BLACK
1316-132782-0044 OF BURNET READING THE PRAYER FOR THE DEPARTING AND OF KETCH LEANING ON THE AXE WITH WHICH RUSSELL AND MONMOUTH HAD BEEN MANGLED IN SO BUTCHERLY A FASHION BEGAN TO HAUNT THE UNHAPPY STATESMAN THERE WAS YET ONE WAY IN WHICH HE MIGHT ESCAPE
1316-132782-0045 A WAY MORE TERRIBLE TO A NOBLE SPIRIT THAN A PRISON OR A SCAFFOLD HE MIGHT STILL BY A WELL TIMED AND USEFUL TREASON EARN HIS PARDON FROM THE FOES OF THE GOVERNMENT IT WAS IN HIS POWER TO RENDER TO THEM AT THIS CONJUNCTURE
1316-132782-0046 SERVICES BEYOND ALL PRICE FOR HE HAD THE ROYAL EAR HE HAD GREAT INFLUENCE OVER THE JESUITICAL CABAL AND HE WAS BLINDLY TRUSTED BY THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR A CHANNEL OF COMMUNICATION WAS NOT WANTING A CHANNEL
1316-132782-0047 SHE VEHEMENTLY PROTESTED THAT IT WAS A FORGERY HER HUSBAND WITH CHARACTERISTIC INGENUITY DEFENDED HIMSELF BY REPRESENTING THAT IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY MAN TO BE SO BASE AS TO DO WHAT HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF DOING
1316-132782-0048 EVEN IF THIS IS LADY SUNDERLAND'S HAND HE SAID THAT IS NO AFFAIR OF MINE YOUR MAJESTY KNOWS MY DOMESTIC MISFORTUNES THE FOOTING ON WHICH MY WIFE AND MISTER SIDNEY ARE IS BUT TOO PUBLIC WHO CAN BELIEVE THAT I WOULD MAKE A CONFIDANT OF THE MAN
1316-132782-0049 WHO HAS INJURED MY HONOUR IN THE TENDEREST POINT
1316-132782-0050 AND SECRET INTELLIGENCE WAS STILL TRANSMITTED FROM THE WITTOL TO THE ADULTERESS FROM THE ADULTERESS TO THE GALLANT
1316-132782-0051 TO THE ENEMIES OF JAMES IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THE FIRST DECISIVE ASSURANCES OF SUNDERLAND'S SUPPORT WERE CONVEYED ORALLY BY SIDNEY TO WILLIAM ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST IT IS CERTAIN THAT FROM THAT TIME TILL THE EXPEDITION WAS READY TO SAIL
1316-132782-0052 THE ANXIETY OF WILLIAM BECAME INTENSE FROM COMMON EYES HIS FEELINGS WERE CONCEALED BY THE ICY TRANQUILLITY OF HIS DEMEANOUR
1316-132782-0053 THE PREPARATIONS WERE NOT QUITE COMPLETE THE DESIGN WAS ALREADY SUSPECTED
1316-132782-0054 THE KING OF FRANCE OR THE CITY OF AMSTERDAM MIGHT STILL FRUSTRATE THE WHOLE PLAN IF LEWIS WERE TO SEND A GREAT FORCE INTO BRABANT
1316-132782-0055 GOD SUPPORT YOU WILLIAM WROTE AND ENABLE YOU TO BEAR YOUR PART IN A WORK ON WHICH AS FAR AS HUMAN BEINGS CAN SEE
