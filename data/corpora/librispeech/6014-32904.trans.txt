6014-32904-0000 ABOUT FOUR DAYS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THE DESPATCHES TO WHICH THE CONFERENCE OF CAPTAIN LAKE AND THE ATTORNEY REFERRED THERE CAME A LETTER FROM THE SAME PROLIFIC CORRESPONDENT DATED TWENTIETH MARCH FROM GENOA WHICH ALTOGETHER PUZZLED MISTER LARKIN
6014-32904-0001 AND GET IT LOOKED AT FIRST THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL MORE BUT THESE WERE THE PASSAGES WHICH PERPLEXED LARKIN HE UNLOCKED THE IRON SAFE AND TOOK OUT THE SHEAF OF WYLDER'S LETTERS AND CONNED THE LAST ONE OVER VERY CAREFULLY
6014-32904-0002 AND WHAT IS THIS JOB OF MARTIN'S IS IT MARTIN OF THE CHINA KILNS OR MARTIN OF THE BANK THAT TOO PLAINLY REFERS TO A FORMER LETTER NOT A WORD OF THE SORT THIS IS VERY ODD INDEED LARKIN'S FINGER TIPS DESCENDED OVER HIS EYEBROW
6014-32904-0003 AND SCRATCHED IN A MINIATURE WAY THERE FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN HIS LARGE LONG HAND DESCENDED FURTHER TO HIS CHIN AND HIS UNDER LIP WAS AS USUAL IN DEEP THOUGHT FONDLED AND PINCHED BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB THERE HAS PLAINLY BEEN A LETTER LOST MANIFESTLY
6014-32904-0004 I NEVER KNEW ANYTHING WRONG IN THIS GYLINGDEN OFFICE DRIVER HAS BEEN ALWAYS CORRECT BUT IT IS HARD TO KNOW ANY MAN FOR CERTAIN IN THIS WORLD I DON'T THINK THE CAPTAIN WOULD VENTURE ANYTHING SO AWFULLY HAZARDOUS I REALLY CAN'T SUSPECT SO MONSTROUS A THING
6014-32904-0005 BEFORE HE REPLACED IT IN ITS IRON DRAWER IT IS NOT A THING TO BE PASSED OVER MURMURED THE ATTORNEY WHO HAD COME TO A DECISION AS TO THE FIRST STEP TO BE TAKEN AND HE THOUGHT WITH A QUALM OF THE EFFECT OF ONE OF WYLDER'S CONFIDENTIAL NOTES
6014-32904-0006 GETTING INTO CAPTAIN LAKE'S HANDS WHILE HE WAS BUTTONING HIS WALKING BOOTS WITH HIS FOOT ON THE CHAIR BEFORE THE FIRE A TAP AT HIS STUDY DOOR SURPRISED HIM A HURRIED GLANCE ON THE TABLE SATISFYING HIM THAT NO SECRET PAPER OR DESPATCH LAY THERE HE CALLED COME IN

6014-32904-0017 I MUCH MISDOUBT SIR IT WON'T TURN OUT TO BE NO GOOD STORY FOR NO ONE SAID MISTER LARCOM IN A LOW AND SAD TONE AND WITH A LONG SHAKE OF HIS HEAD NO GOOD STORY HEY HOW DO YOU MEAN LARCOM WELL SIR
6014-32904-0018 I KNOW YOU WON'T MENTION ME MISTER LARKIN CERTAINLY NOT GO ON
6014-32904-0019 THOUGH ME COMING INTO THE ROOM JUST SO AND WHAT DO YOU FOUND YOUR OPINION ABOUT MISTER MARK WYLDER ON WELL SIR I COULD NOT HEAR MORE THAN A WORD NOW AND A SENTINCE AGAIN AND PICKIN WHAT MEANING I COULD OUT OF WHAT MISS LAKE SAID AND THE CAPTING COULD NOT DENY
6014-32904-0020 I DO SUSPECK SIR MOST SERIOUS AS HOW THEY HAVE PUT MISTER MARK WYLDER INTO A MAD HOUSE AND THAT'S HOW I THINK IT'S GONE WITH HIM AN YOU'LL NEVER SEE HIM OUT AGAIN IF THE CAPTING HAS HIS WILL DO YOU MEAN TO SAY
6014-32904-0021 YOU ACTUALLY THINK HE'S SHUT UP IN A MADHOUSE AT THIS MOMENT DEMANDED THE ATTORNEY HIS LITTLE PINK EYES OPENED QUITE ROUND AND HIS LANK CHEEKS AND TALL FOREHEAD FLUSHED AT THE RUSH OF WILD IDEAS THAT WHIRRED ROUND HIM LIKE A COVEY OF BIRDS AT THE STARTLING SUGGESTION
6014-32904-0022 THE BUTLER NODDED GLOOMILY LARKIN CONTINUED TO STARE ON HIM IN SILENCE WITH HIS ROUND EYES FOR SOME SECONDS AFTER IN A MAD HOUSE POOH POOH INCREDIBLE POOH IMPOSSIBLE QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
6014-32904-0023 I CAN'T SAY SIR AS I REMEMBER BUT I RAYTHER THINK NOT I ONLY KNOW FOR CERTAIN I TOOK IT SO AND I DO BELIEVE AS HOW MISTER MARK WYLDER IS CONFINED IN A MAD HOUSE AND THE CAPTAIN KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT AND WON'T DO NOTHING TO GET HIM OUT
6014-32904-0024 VERY ODD VERY STRANGE BUT IT IS ONLY FROM THE GENERAL TENOR OF WHAT PASSED BY A SORT OF GUESS WORK YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT THAT CONCLUSION LARCOM ASSENTED WELL MISTER LARCOM
6014-32904-0025 IN FACT A VERY CONFIDENTIAL ONE ALIKE IN RELATION TO MISTER WYLDER AND TO THE FAMILY OF BRANDON HALL IS OF COURSE SACRED AND ANYTHING THAT COMES FROM YOU MISTER LARCOM IS NEVER HEARD IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR NAME BEYOND THESE WALLS
6014-32904-0026 HE STOPPED WITH HIS FINGERTIPS TO HIS EYEBROW AND THOUGHT MORE THEN HE TOOK ANOTHER TURN AND STOPPED AGAIN AND THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND GAZED FOR A WHILE ON THE CEILING AND THEN HE STOOD FOR A TIME AT THE WINDOW WITH HIS LIP BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB
6014-32904-0027 NO IT WAS A MISTAKE IT COULD NOT BE IT WAS MARK WYLDER'S PENMANSHIP HE COULD SWEAR TO IT THERE WAS NO TRACE OF MADNESS IN HIS LETTERS NOR OF RESTRAINT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE EVEN THAT HE WAS WANDERING FROM PLACE TO PLACE UNDER THE COERCION OF A COUPLE OF KEEPERS
6014-32904-0028 NO WYLDER WAS AN ENERGETIC AND SOMEWHAT VIOLENT PERSON WITH HIGH ANIMAL COURAGE AND WOULD BE SURE TO BLOW UP AND BREAK THROUGH ANY SUCH MACHINATION NO NO
6014-32904-0029 WITH MARK WYLDER IT WAS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION ALTOGETHER VISIONARY AND IMPRACTICABLE PERSONS LIKE LARCOM DO MAKE SUCH ABSURD BLUNDERS AND SO MISAPPREHEND THE CONVERSATION OF EDUCATED PEOPLE NOTHWITHSTANDING ALL WHICH
6014-32904-0030 THERE REMAINED IN HIS MIND AN IMAGE OF MARK WYLDER IN THE STRAW AND DARKNESS OF A SOLITARY CONTINENTAL MAD HOUSE SQUALID NEGLECTED AND BECOMING GRADUALLY THAT WHICH HE WAS SAID TO BE
6014-32904-0031 AND WITH HIS TEETH BURIED IN HIS OWN ARM QUITE IMPOSSIBLE MARK WYLDER WAS THE LAST MAN IN THE WORLD TO SUBMIT TO PHYSICAL COERCION THE IDEA BESIDES COULD NOT BE RECONCILED WITH THE FACTS OF THE CASE IT WAS ALL A BLUNDERING CHIMERA
6014-32904-0032 MISTER LARKIN WALKED DOWN DIRECT TO GYLINGDEN AND PAID A RATHER AWFUL VISIT TO MISTER DRIVER OF THE POST OFFICE A FOREIGN LETTER ADDRESSED TO HIM HAD MOST POSITIVELY BEEN LOST HE HAD CALLED TO MENTION THE CIRCUMSTANCE LEST MISTER DRIVER SHOULD BE TAKEN BY SURPRISE BY OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION
