4495-18533-0000 THE OLD MINER HAD EVIDENTLY NOT WRITTEN IT BUT NO LESS EVIDENTLY THE AUTHOR OF THIS SECOND LETTER KNEW THE OVERMAN'S SECRET SINCE IT EXPRESSLY CONTRADICTED THE INVITATION TO THE
4495-18533-0001 ENGINEER TO GO TO THE YARROW SHAFT WAS IT REALLY TRUE THAT THE FIRST COMMUNICATION WAS NOW WITHOUT OBJECT DID SOMEONE WISH TO PREVENT JAMES STARR FROM TROUBLING HIMSELF EITHER USELESSLY OR OTHERWISE
4495-18533-0002 THIS WAS THE CONCLUSION AT WHICH JAMES STARR ARRIVED AFTER MATURE REFLECTION THE CONTRADICTION WHICH EXISTED BETWEEN THE TWO LETTERS ONLY WROUGHT IN HIM A MORE KEEN DESIRE TO VISIT THE DOCHART PIT AND BESIDES
4495-18533-0003 IF AFTER ALL IT WAS A HOAX IT WAS WELL WORTH WHILE TO PROVE IT STARR ALSO THOUGHT IT WISER TO GIVE MORE CREDENCE TO THE FIRST LETTER THAN TO THE SECOND THAT IS TO SAY TO THE REQUEST OF SUCH A MAN AS SIMON FORD
4495-18533-0004 RATHER THAN TO THE WARNING OF HIS ANONYMOUS CONTRADICTOR INDEED SAID HE
4495-18533-0005 SHOWS THAT FORD'S COMMUNICATION MUST BE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO MORROW AT THE APPOINTED TIME I SHALL BE AT THE RENDEZVOUS IN THE EVENING STARR MADE HIS PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE
4495-18533-0006 AS IT MIGHT HAPPEN THAT HIS ABSENCE WOULD BE PROLONGED FOR SOME DAYS HE WROTE TO SIR W ELPHISTON
4495-18533-0007 HE WENT TO BED MORE EXCITED THAN THE AFFAIR PERHAPS WARRANTED THE NEXT DAY AT FIVE O'CLOCK JAMES STARR JUMPED OUT OF BED DRESSED HIMSELF WARMLY
4495-18533-0008 TO GO TO GRANTON PIER TO CATCH THE STEAMER WHICH IN THREE HOURS WOULD TAKE HIM UP THE FORTH AS FAR AS STIRLING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE PERHAPS IN PASSING ALONG THE CANONGATE
4495-18533-0009 THE PALACE OF THE FORMER SOVEREIGNS OF SCOTLAND HE DID NOT NOTICE THE SENTINELS WHO STOOD BEFORE ITS GATEWAYS DRESSED IN THE UNIFORM OF THEIR HIGHLAND REGIMENT TARTAN KILT PLAID AND SPORRAN COMPLETE
4495-18533-0010 HIS WHOLE THOUGHT WAS TO REACH CALLANDER WHERE HARRY FORD WAS SUPPOSEDLY AWAITING HIM THE BETTER TO UNDERSTAND THIS NARRATIVE IT WILL BE AS WELL TO HEAR A FEW WORDS ON THE ORIGIN OF COAL DURING THE GEOLOGICAL EPOCH
4495-18533-0011 FROM THE NECKS OF THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF SELTZER WATER BOTTLES THIS LIQUID LOADED WITH CARBONIC ACID RUSHED IN TORRENTS OVER A DEEP SOFT SOIL SUBJECT TO SUDDEN OR SLOW ALTERATIONS OF FORM
4495-18533-0012 AND MAINTAINED IN ITS SEMI FLUID STATE AS MUCH BY THE HEAT OF THE SUN AS BY THE FIRES OF THE INTERIOR MASS THE INTERNAL HEAT HAD NOT AS YET BEEN COLLECTED IN THE CENTER OF THE GLOBE THE TERRESTRIAL CRUST THIN AND INCOMPLETELY HARDENED
4495-18533-0013 ALLOWED IT TO SPREAD THROUGH ITS PORES
4495-18533-0014 PECULIAR FORM OF VEGETATION SUCH AS IS PROBABLY PRODUCED ON THE SURFACE OF THE INFERIOR PLANETS VENUS OR MERCURY WHICH REVOLVE NEARER THAN OUR EARTH AROUND THE RADIANT SUN OF OUR SYSTEM
4495-18533-0015 THE SOIL OF THE CONTINENTS WAS COVERED WITH IMMENSE FORESTS CARBONIC ACID SO SUITABLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM ABOUNDED THE FEET OF THESE TREES WERE DROWNED IN A SORT OF IMMENSE LAGOON
4495-18533-0016 KEPT CONTINUALLY FULL BY CURRENTS OF FRESH AND SALT WATERS THEY EAGERLY ASSIMILATED TO THEMSELVES THE CARBON WHICH THEY LITTLE BY LITTLE EXTRACTED FROM THE ATMOSPHERE AS YET UNFIT FOR THE FUNCTION OF LIFE
4495-18533-0017 AND IT MAY BE SAID THAT THEY WERE DESTINED TO STORE IT IN THE FORM OF COAL IN THE VERY BOWELS OF THE EARTH IT WAS THE EARTHQUAKE PERIOD CAUSED BY INTERNAL CONVULSIONS WHICH SUDDENLY MODIFIED THE UNSETTLED FEATURES OF THE TERRESTRIAL SURFACE
4495-18533-0018 OR SETTLING TOGETHER IN A HEAP THEY FORMED A SOLID MASS AS THE WATERS WERE CONTAINED IN NO BED
4495-18533-0019 THEY RUSHED WHERE THEY LIKED TEARING FROM THE SCARCELY FORMED ROCKS MATERIAL WITH WHICH TO COMPOSE SCHISTS SANDSTONES AND LIMESTONES THIS THE ROVING WAVES BORE OVER THE SUBMERGED AND NOW PEATY FORESTS
4495-18533-0020 UNDER A THICK CARAPACE OF PUDDING STONE SCHIST
4495-18533-0021 THE WHOLE OF THE MASSIVE FORESTS AND WHAT WENT ON IN THIS GIGANTIC CRUCIBLE WHERE ALL THIS VEGETABLE MATTER HAD ACCUMULATED SUNK TO VARIOUS DEPTHS
4495-18533-0022 A REGULAR CHEMICAL OPERATION A SORT OF DISTILLATION ALL THE CARBON CONTAINED IN THESE VEGETABLES HAD AGGLOMERATED AND LITTLE BY LITTLE COAL WAS FORMING UNDER THE DOUBLE INFLUENCE OF ENORMOUS PRESSURE
4495-18533-0023 AND THE HIGH TEMPERATURE MAINTAINED BY THE INTERNAL FIRES AT THIS TIME SO CLOSE TO IT THUS THERE WAS ONE KINGDOM SUBSTITUTED FOR ANOTHER IN THIS SLOW BUT IRRESISTIBLE REACTION THE VEGETABLE WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A MINERAL
4495-18533-0024 THUS ALSO SHELLS ZOOPHYTES STAR FISH POLYPI SPIRIFORES EVEN FISH AND LIZARDS BROUGHT BY THE WATER
4495-18533-0025 THUS IN THE LOWEST LAYERS OF THE COAL GROUND APPEARS THE ANTHRACITE WHICH BEING ALMOST DESTITUTE OF VOLATILE MATTER CONTAINS THE GREATEST QUANTITY OF CARBON
4495-18533-0026 IN THE HIGHER BEDS ARE FOUND ON THE CONTRARY LIGNITE AND FOSSIL WOOD SUBSTANCES IN WHICH THE QUANTITY OF CARBON IS INFINITELY LESS
4495-18533-0027 BETWEEN THESE TWO BEDS ACCORDING TO THE DEGREE OF PRESSURE TO WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED ARE FOUND VEINS OF GRAPHITE AND RICH OR POOR COAL IT MAY BE ASSERTED THAT IT IS FOR WANT OF SUFFICIENT PRESSURE
4495-18533-0028 SO THEN THE ORIGIN OF COAL MINES IN WHATEVER PART OF THE GLOBE THEY HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IS THIS
4495-18533-0029 AND UNDER THE ACTION OF CARBONIC ACID NOW AT THE TIME WHEN THE EVENTS RELATED IN THIS STORY TOOK PLACE SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MINES OF THE SCOTTISH COAL BEDS HAD BEEN EXHAUSTED BY TOO RAPID WORKING
4495-18533-0030 IN THE REGION WHICH EXTENDS BETWEEN EDINBURGH AND GLASGOW FOR A DISTANCE OF TEN OR TWELVE MILES
4495-18533-0031 OF WHICH THE ENGINEER JAMES STARR HAD SO LONG DIRECTED THE WORKS FOR TEN YEARS THESE MINES HAD BEEN ABANDONED
4495-18533-0032 ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDINGS HAD BEEN CARRIED TO A DEPTH OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED OR EVEN OF TWO THOUSAND FEET AND WHEN JAMES STARR HAD RETIRED IT WAS WITH THE FULL CONVICTION THAT EVEN THE SMALLEST VEIN HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED
4495-18533-0033 UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WAS PLAIN THAT THE DISCOVERY OF A NEW SEAM OF COAL WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT EVENT COULD SIMON FORD'S COMMUNICATION RELATE TO A FACT OF THIS NATURE
4495-18533-0034 THIS QUESTION JAMES STARR COULD NOT CEASE ASKING HIMSELF WAS HE CALLED TO MAKE CONQUEST OF ANOTHER CORNER OF THESE RICH TREASURE FIELDS FAIN WOULD HE HOPE IT WAS SO
4495-18533-0035 THE SECOND LETTER HAD FOR AN INSTANT CHECKED HIS SPECULATIONS ON THIS SUBJECT BUT NOW HE THOUGHT OF THAT LETTER NO LONGER BESIDES THE SON OF THE OLD OVERMAN WAS THERE WAITING AT THE APPOINTED RENDEZVOUS THE ANONYMOUS LETTER WAS THEREFORE WORTH NOTHING
4495-18533-0036 ARE YOU HARRY FORD ASKED THE ENGINEER QUICKLY YES MISTER STARR
4495-18533-0037 I KNEW YOU DIRECTLY SIR REPLIED THE YOUNG MINER CAP IN HAND YOU HAVE NOT CHANGED YOU LOOK JUST AS YOU DID WHEN YOU BADE US GOOD BY IN THE DOCHART PIT I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN THAT DAY PUT ON YOUR CAP HARRY SAID THE ENGINEER
4495-18533-0038 I AM AT YOUR ORDERS REPLIED HARRY TELL ME HARRY IS YOUR FATHER WELL VERY WELL MISTER STARR AND YOUR MOTHER SHE IS WELL TOO
4495-18533-0039 NO IT WAS I THEN DID SIMON FORD SEND ME A SECOND LETTER TO CONTRADICT THE FIRST ASKED THE ENGINEER QUICKLY
4495-18533-0040 VERY WELL SAID STARR WITHOUT SPEAKING OF THE ANONYMOUS LETTER THEN CONTINUING
4495-18533-0041 IN THE MINE WHAT IN THE DOCHART PIT YES MISTER STARR REPLIED HARRY REALLY HAS YOUR FAMILY NEVER LEFT THE OLD MINE SINCE THE CESSATION OF THE WORKS
4495-18533-0042 NOT A DAY MISTER STARR YOU KNOW MY FATHER
4495-18533-0043 AND WE HAVE BUT FEW WANTS WELL HARRY SAID THE ENGINEER LEAD THE WAY
