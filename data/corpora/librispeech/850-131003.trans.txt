850-131003-0000 THE EXPENSE OF RAISING TROOPS OF BUILDING AND EQUIPPING FLEETS AND ALL OTHER EXPENSES IN ANY WISE CONNECTED WITH MILITARY ARRANGEMENTS AND OPERATIONS BUT THESE ARE NOT THE ONLY OBJECTS TO WHICH THE JURISDICTION OF THE UNION IN RESPECT TO REVENUE
850-131003-0001 MUST NECESSARILY BE EMPOWERED TO EXTEND IT MUST EMBRACE A PROVISION FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE NATIONAL CIVIL LIST FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE NATIONAL DEBTS CONTRACTED OR THAT MAY BE CONTRACTED AND IN GENERAL
850-131003-0002 FOR ALL THOSE MATTERS WHICH WILL CALL FOR DISBURSEMENTS OUT OF THE NATIONAL TREASURY THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THERE MUST BE INTERWOVEN IN THE FRAME OF THE GOVERNMENT A GENERAL POWER OF TAXATION IN ONE SHAPE OR ANOTHER MONEY IS WITH PROPRIETY
850-131003-0003 CONSIDERED AS THE VITAL PRINCIPLE OF THE BODY POLITIC AS THAT WHICH SUSTAINS ITS LIFE AND MOTION AND ENABLES IT TO PERFORM ITS MOST ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS A COMPLETE POWER THEREFORE TO PROCURE A REGULAR AND ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF IT
850-131003-0004 AS FAR AS THE RESOURCES OF THE COMMUNITY WILL PERMIT MAY BE REGARDED AS AN INDISPENSABLE INGREDIENT IN EVERY CONSTITUTION FROM A DEFICIENCY IN THIS PARTICULAR ONE OF TWO EVILS MUST ENSUE
850-131003-0005 EITHER THE PEOPLE MUST BE SUBJECTED TO CONTINUAL PLUNDER AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR A MORE ELIGIBLE MODE OF SUPPLYING THE PUBLIC WANTS OR THE GOVERNMENT MUST SINK INTO A FATAL ATROPHY AND IN A SHORT COURSE OF TIME PERISH
850-131003-0006 IN THE OTTOMAN OR TURKISH EMPIRE THE SOVEREIGN THOUGH IN OTHER RESPECTS ABSOLUTE MASTER OF THE LIVES AND FORTUNES OF HIS SUBJECTS HAS NO RIGHT TO IMPOSE A NEW TAX THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT HE PERMITS THE BASHAWS OR GOVERNORS OF PROVINCES
850-131003-0007 TO PILLAGE THE PEOPLE WITHOUT MERCY AND IN TURN SQUEEZES OUT OF THEM THE SUMS OF WHICH HE STANDS IN NEED TO SATISFY HIS OWN EXIGENCIES AND THOSE OF THE STATE IN AMERICA FROM A LIKE CAUSE
850-131003-0008 THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNION HAS GRADUALLY DWINDLED INTO A STATE OF DECAY APPROACHING NEARLY TO ANNIHILATION WHO CAN DOUBT THAT THE HAPPINESS OF THE PEOPLE IN BOTH COUNTRIES WOULD BE PROMOTED BY COMPETENT AUTHORITIES IN THE PROPER HANDS
850-131003-0009 TO PROVIDE THE REVENUES WHICH THE NECESSITIES OF THE PUBLIC MIGHT REQUIRE THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION FEEBLE AS IT IS INTENDED TO REPOSE IN THE UNITED STATES AN UNLIMITED POWER OF PROVIDING FOR THE PECUNIARY WANTS OF THE UNION
850-131003-0010 BUT PROCEEDING UPON AN ERRONEOUS PRINCIPLE IT HAS BEEN DONE IN SUCH A MANNER AS ENTIRELY TO HAVE FRUSTRATED THE INTENTION CONGRESS BY THE ARTICLES WHICH COMPOSE THAT COMPACT AS HAS ALREADY BEEN STATED
850-131003-0011 TO THE SERVICE OF THE UNITED STATES
850-131003-0012 ARE IN EVERY CONSTITUTIONAL SENSE OBLIGATORY UPON THE STATES THESE HAVE NO RIGHT TO QUESTION THE PROPRIETY OF THE DEMAND NO DISCRETION BEYOND THAT OF DEVISING THE WAYS AND MEANS OF FURNISHING THE SUMS DEMANDED
850-131003-0013 BUT THOUGH THIS BE STRICTLY AND TRULY THE CASE THOUGH THE ASSUMPTION OF SUCH A RIGHT WOULD BE AN INFRINGEMENT OF THE ARTICLES OF UNION THOUGH IT MAY SELDOM OR NEVER HAVE BEEN AVOWEDLY CLAIMED YET IN PRACTICE
850-131003-0014 IT HAS BEEN CONSTANTLY EXERCISED AND WOULD CONTINUE TO BE SO AS LONG AS THE REVENUES OF THE CONFEDERACY SHOULD REMAIN DEPENDENT ON THE INTERMEDIATE AGENCY OF ITS MEMBERS WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SYSTEM HAVE BEEN
850-131003-0015 AND HAS BEEN AMPLY UNFOLDED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THESE INQUIRIES IT IS THIS WHICH HAS CHIEFLY CONTRIBUTED TO REDUCE US TO A SITUATION WHICH AFFORDS AMPLE CAUSE BOTH OF MORTIFICATION TO OURSELVES
850-131003-0016 AND OF TRIUMPH TO OUR ENEMIES WHAT REMEDY CAN THERE BE FOR THIS SITUATION BUT IN A CHANGE OF THE SYSTEM WHICH HAS PRODUCED IT IN A CHANGE OF THE FALLACIOUS AND DELUSIVE SYSTEM OF QUOTAS AND REQUISITIONS
850-131003-0017 WHAT SUBSTITUTE CAN THERE BE IMAGINED FOR THIS IGNIS FATUUS IN FINANCE BUT THAT OF PERMITTING THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO RAISE ITS OWN REVENUES BY THE ORDINARY METHODS OF TAXATION AUTHORIZED IN EVERY WELL ORDERED CONSTITUTION OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT
850-131003-0018 INGENIOUS MEN MAY DECLAIM WITH PLAUSIBILITY ON ANY SUBJECT BUT NO HUMAN INGENUITY CAN POINT OUT ANY OTHER EXPEDIENT TO RESCUE US FROM THE INCONVENIENCES AND EMBARRASSMENTS NATURALLY RESULTING FROM DEFECTIVE SUPPLIES OF THE PUBLIC TREASURY
850-131003-0019 THE MORE INTELLIGENT ADVERSARIES OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION ADMIT THE FORCE OF THIS REASONING BUT THEY QUALIFY THEIR ADMISSION BY A DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT THEY CALL INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TAXATION THE FORMER
850-131003-0020 THEY WOULD RESERVE TO THE STATE GOVERNMENTS THE LATTER WHICH THEY EXPLAIN INTO COMMERCIAL IMPOSTS OR RATHER DUTIES ON IMPORTED ARTICLES THEY DECLARE THEMSELVES WILLING TO CONCEDE TO THE FEDERAL HEAD
850-131003-0021 THIS DISTINCTION HOWEVER WOULD VIOLATE THE MAXIM OF GOOD SENSE AND SOUND POLICY WHICH DICTATES THAT EVERY POWER OUGHT TO BE IN PROPORTION TO ITS OBJECT AND WOULD STILL LEAVE THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT IN A KIND OF TUTELAGE TO THE STATE GOVERNMENTS
850-131003-0022 INCONSISTENT WITH EVERY IDEA OF VIGOR OR EFFICIENCY WHO CAN PRETEND THAT COMMERCIAL IMPOSTS ARE OR WOULD BE ALONE EQUAL TO THE PRESENT AND FUTURE EXIGENCIES OF THE UNION
850-131003-0023 TAKING INTO THE ACCOUNT THE EXISTING DEBT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC UPON ANY PLAN OF EXTINGUISHMENT WHICH A MAN MODERATELY IMPRESSED WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC JUSTICE AND PUBLIC CREDIT COULD APPROVE
850-131003-0024 IN ADDITION TO THE ESTABLISHMENTS WHICH ALL PARTIES WILL ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE NECESSARY WE COULD NOT REASONABLY FLATTER OURSELVES THAT THIS RESOURCE ALONE UPON THE MOST IMPROVED SCALE WOULD EVEN SUFFICE FOR ITS PRESENT NECESSITIES
850-131003-0025 ITS FUTURE NECESSITIES ADMIT NOT OF CALCULATION OR LIMITATION AND UPON THE PRINCIPLE MORE THAN ONCE ADVERTED TO THE POWER OF MAKING PROVISION FOR THEM AS THEY ARISE OUGHT TO BE EQUALLY UNCONFINED
850-131003-0026 I BELIEVE IT MAY BE REGARDED AS A POSITION WARRANTED BY THE HISTORY OF MANKIND THAT IN THE USUAL PROGRESS OF THINGS THE NECESSITIES OF A NATION IN EVERY STAGE OF ITS EXISTENCE WILL BE FOUND AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS RESOURCES
850-131003-0027 TO SAY THAT DEFICIENCIES MAY BE PROVIDED FOR BY REQUISITIONS UPON THE STATES IS ON THE ONE HAND TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS SYSTEM CANNOT BE DEPENDED UPON AND ON THE OTHER HAND TO DEPEND UPON IT FOR EVERY THING BEYOND A CERTAIN LIMIT
850-131003-0028 THOSE WHO HAVE CAREFULLY ATTENDED TO ITS VICES AND DEFORMITIES AS THEY HAVE BEEN EXHIBITED BY EXPERIENCE OR DELINEATED IN THE COURSE OF THESE PAPERS MUST FEEL INVINCIBLE REPUGNANCY TO TRUSTING THE NATIONAL INTERESTS IN ANY DEGREE TO ITS OPERATION
850-131003-0029 ITS INEVITABLE TENDENCY WHENEVER IT IS BROUGHT INTO ACTIVITY MUST BE TO ENFEEBLE THE UNION AND SOW THE SEEDS OF DISCORD AND CONTENTION BETWEEN THE FEDERAL HEAD AND ITS MEMBERS AND BETWEEN THE MEMBERS THEMSELVES
850-131003-0030 CAN IT BE EXPECTED THAT THE DEFICIENCIES WOULD BE BETTER SUPPLIED IN THIS MODE THAN THE TOTAL WANTS OF THE UNION HAVE HERETOFORE BEEN SUPPLIED IN THE SAME MODE
850-131003-0031 THEY WILL HAVE PROPORTIONABLY LESS MEANS TO ANSWER THE DEMAND IF THE OPINIONS OF THOSE WHO CONTEND FOR THE DISTINCTION WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED WERE TO BE RECEIVED AS EVIDENCE OF TRUTH ONE WOULD BE LED TO CONCLUDE THAT THERE WAS SOME KNOWN POINT IN THE ECONOMY OF NATIONAL AFFAIRS
850-131003-0032 AT WHICH IT WOULD BE SAFE TO STOP AND TO SAY THUS FAR THE ENDS OF PUBLIC HAPPINESS WILL BE PROMOTED BY SUPPLYING THE WANTS OF GOVERNMENT AND ALL BEYOND THIS IS UNWORTHY OF OUR CARE OR ANXIETY
850-131003-0033 HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT A GOVERNMENT HALF SUPPLIED AND ALWAYS NECESSITOUS CAN FULFILL THE PURPOSES OF ITS INSTITUTION CAN PROVIDE FOR THE SECURITY ADVANCE THE PROSPERITY OR SUPPORT THE REPUTATION OF THE COMMONWEALTH
850-131003-0034 HOW CAN IT EVER POSSESS EITHER ENERGY OR STABILITY DIGNITY OR CREDIT CONFIDENCE AT HOME OR RESPECTABILITY ABROAD HOW CAN ITS ADMINISTRATION BE ANY THING ELSE THAN A SUCCESSION OF EXPEDIENTS TEMPORIZING
850-131003-0035 IMPOTENT DISGRACEFUL HOW WILL IT BE ABLE TO AVOID A FREQUENT SACRIFICE OF ITS ENGAGEMENTS TO IMMEDIATE NECESSITY HOW CAN IT UNDERTAKE OR EXECUTE ANY LIBERAL OR ENLARGED PLANS OF PUBLIC GOOD
850-131003-0036 LET US ATTEND TO WHAT WOULD BE THE EFFECTS OF THIS SITUATION IN THE VERY FIRST WAR IN WHICH WE SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE ENGAGED WE WILL PRESUME FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE THAT THE REVENUE ARISING FROM THE IMPOST DUTIES ANSWERS THE PURPOSES OF A PROVISION FOR THE PUBLIC DEBT
850-131003-0037 AND OF A PEACE ESTABLISHMENT FOR THE UNION THUS CIRCUMSTANCED A WAR BREAKS OUT WHAT WOULD BE THE PROBABLE CONDUCT OF THE GOVERNMENT IN SUCH AN EMERGENCY TAUGHT BY EXPERIENCE THAT PROPER DEPENDENCE COULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE SUCCESS OF REQUISITIONS
850-131003-0038 UNABLE BY ITS OWN AUTHORITY TO LAY HOLD OF FRESH RESOURCES AND URGED BY CONSIDERATIONS OF NATIONAL DANGER WOULD IT NOT BE DRIVEN TO THE EXPEDIENT OF DIVERTING THE FUNDS ALREADY APPROPRIATED FROM THEIR PROPER OBJECTS TO THE DEFENSE OF THE STATE
850-131003-0039 IT IS NOT EASY TO SEE HOW A STEP OF THIS KIND COULD BE AVOIDED AND IF IT SHOULD BE TAKEN IT IS EVIDENT THAT IT WOULD PROVE THE DESTRUCTION OF PUBLIC CREDIT AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT IT WAS BECOMING ESSENTIAL TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY
850-131003-0040 TO IMAGINE THAT AT SUCH A CRISIS CREDIT MIGHT BE DISPENSED WITH WOULD BE THE EXTREME OF INFATUATION IN THE MODERN SYSTEM OF WAR NATIONS THE MOST WEALTHY ARE OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO LARGE LOANS
850-131003-0041 A COUNTRY SO LITTLE OPULENT AS OURS MUST FEEL THIS NECESSITY IN A MUCH STRONGER DEGREE BUT WHO WOULD LEND TO A GOVERNMENT THAT PREFACED ITS OVERTURES FOR BORROWING
850-131003-0042 BY AN ACT WHICH DEMONSTRATED THAT NO RELIANCE COULD BE PLACED ON THE STEADINESS OF ITS MEASURES FOR PAYING THE LOANS IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROCURE WOULD BE AS LIMITED IN THEIR EXTENT AS BURDENSOME IN THEIR CONDITIONS
850-131003-0043 THEY WOULD BE MADE UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLES THAT USURERS COMMONLY LEND TO BANKRUPT AND FRAUDULENT DEBTORS WITH A SPARING HAND AND AT ENORMOUS PREMIUMS IT MAY PERHAPS BE IMAGINED THAT FROM THE SCANTINESS OF THE RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY
850-131003-0044 THE NECESSITY OF DIVERTING THE ESTABLISHED FUNDS IN THE CASE SUPPOSED WOULD EXIST THOUGH THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD POSSESS AN UNRESTRAINED POWER OF TAXATION BUT TWO CONSIDERATIONS WILL SERVE TO QUIET ALL APPREHENSION ON THIS HEAD ONE IS
850-131003-0045 THAT WE ARE SURE THE RESOURCES OF THE COMMUNITY IN THEIR FULL EXTENT WILL BE BROUGHT INTO ACTIVITY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE UNION THE OTHER IS THAT WHATEVER DEFICIENCES THERE MAY BE CAN WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BE SUPPLIED BY LOANS
850-131003-0046 THE POWER OF CREATING NEW FUNDS UPON NEW OBJECTS OF TAXATION BY ITS OWN AUTHORITY WOULD ENABLE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO BORROW AS FAR AS ITS NECESSITIES MIGHT REQUIRE FOREIGNERS AS WELL AS THE CITIZENS OF AMERICA
850-131003-0047 COULD THEN REASONABLY REPOSE CONFIDENCE IN ITS ENGAGEMENTS BUT TO DEPEND UPON A GOVERNMENT THAT MUST ITSELF DEPEND UPON THIRTEEN OTHER GOVERNMENTS FOR THE MEANS OF FULFILLING ITS CONTRACTS WHEN ONCE ITS SITUATION IS CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD
850-131003-0048 WOULD REQUIRE A DEGREE OF CREDULITY NOT OFTEN TO BE MET WITH IN THE PECUNIARY TRANSACTIONS OF MANKIND AND LITTLE RECONCILABLE WITH THE USUAL SHARP SIGHTEDNESS OF AVARICE REFLECTIONS OF THIS KIND MAY HAVE TRIFLING WEIGHT WITH MEN WHO HOPE TO SEE REALIZED IN AMERICA
850-131003-0049 THE HALCYON SCENES OF THE POETIC OR FABULOUS AGE BUT TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE WE ARE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE A COMMON PORTION OF THE VICISSITUDES AND CALAMITIES WHICH HAVE FALLEN TO THE LOT OF OTHER NATIONS THEY MUST APPEAR ENTITLED TO SERIOUS ATTENTION
850-131003-0050 SUCH MEN MUST BEHOLD THE ACTUAL SITUATION OF THEIR COUNTRY WITH PAINFUL SOLICITUDE AND DEPRECATE THE EVILS WHICH AMBITION OR REVENGE MIGHT
