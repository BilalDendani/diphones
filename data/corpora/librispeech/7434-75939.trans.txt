7434-75939-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY TWO MONSIEUR IS JEALOUS OF GUICHE MONSIEUR ENTERED THE ROOM ABRUPTLY AS PERSONS DO WHO MEAN WELL AND THINK THEY CONFER PLEASURE OR AS THOSE WHO HOPE TO SURPRISE SOME SECRET
7434-75939-0001 THE TERRIBLE REWARD OF JEALOUS PEOPLE MADAME ALMOST OUT OF HER SENSES WITH JOY AT THE FIRST BARS OF MUSIC WAS DANCING IN THE MOST UNRESTRAINED MANNER
7434-75939-0002 WHO WITH HIS ARMS RAISED AND HIS EYES HALF CLOSED WAS KNEELING ON ONE KNEE LIKE THE SPANISH DANCERS WITH LOOKS FULL OF PASSION AND GESTURES OF THE MOST CARESSING CHARACTER THE PRINCESS WAS DANCING ROUND HIM WITH A RESPONSIVE SMILE
7434-75939-0003 AND THE SAME AIR OF ALLURING SEDUCTIVENESS MONTALAIS STOOD BY ADMIRINGLY LA VALLIERE SEATED IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM LOOKED ON THOUGHTFULLY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECT WHICH THE PRESENCE OF THE PRINCE PRODUCED UPON THIS GLEEFUL COMPANY
7434-75939-0004 AND IT WOULD BE EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECT WHICH THE SIGHT OF THEIR HAPPINESS PRODUCED UPON PHILIP THE COMTE DE GUICHE HAD NO POWER TO MOVE MADAME REMAINED IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OF THE FIGURES AND OF AN ATTITUDE UNABLE TO UTTER A WORD
7434-75939-0005 THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE LEANING HIS BACK AGAINST THE DOORWAY SMILED LIKE A MAN IN THE VERY HEIGHT OF THE FRANKEST ADMIRATION THE PALLOR OF THE PRINCE AND THE CONVULSIVE TWITCHING OF HIS HANDS AND LIMBS WERE THE FIRST SYMPTOMS THAT STRUCK THOSE PRESENT
7434-75939-0006 A DEAD SILENCE SUCCEEDED THE MERRY MUSIC OF THE DANCE THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS INTERVAL TO SALUTE MADAME AND DE GUICHE MOST RESPECTFULLY AFFECTING TO JOIN THEM TOGETHER IN HIS REVERENCES AS THOUGH THEY WERE THE MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE
7434-75939-0007 MONSIEUR THEN APPROACHED THEM SAYING IN A HOARSE TONE OF VOICE I AM DELIGHTED I CAME HERE EXPECTING TO FIND YOU ILL AND LOW SPIRITED AND I FIND YOU ABANDONING YOURSELF TO NEW AMUSEMENTS REALLY IT IS MOST FORTUNATE
7434-75939-0008 MY HOUSE IS THE PLEASANTEST IN THE KINGDOM THEN TURNING TOWARDS DE GUICHE COMTE HE SAID I DID NOT KNOW YOU WERE SO GOOD A DANCER AND AGAIN ADDRESSING HIS WIFE HE SAID SHOW A LITTLE MORE CONSIDERATION FOR ME MADAME
7434-75939-0009 WHENEVER YOU INTEND TO AMUSE YOURSELVES HERE INVITE ME I AM A PRINCE UNFORTUNATELY VERY MUCH NEGLECTED GUICHE HAD NOW RECOVERED HIS SELF POSSESSION AND WITH THE SPIRITED BOLDNESS WHICH WAS NATURAL TO HIM AND SAT SO WELL UPON HIM HE SAID
7434-75939-0010 AND WHENEVER THERE IS A QUESTION OF ITS BEING NEEDED I AM READY BUT TO DAY AS IT IS ONLY A QUESTION OF DANCING TO MUSIC I DANCE AND YOU ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT SAID THE PRINCE COLDLY BUT MADAME HE CONTINUED
7434-75939-0011 YOU DO NOT REMARK THAT YOUR LADIES DEPRIVE ME OF MY FRIENDS
7434-75939-0012 IF YOU WISH TO DINE WITHOUT ME YOU HAVE YOUR LADIES WHEN I DINE ALONE I HAVE MY GENTLEMEN DO NOT STRIP ME OF EVERYTHING MADAME FELT THE REPROACH AND THE LESSON AND THE COLOR RUSHED TO HER FACE MONSIEUR SHE REPLIED
7434-75939-0013 I WAS NOT AWARE WHEN I CAME TO THE COURT OF FRANCE THAT PRINCESSES OF MY RANK WERE TO BE REGARDED AS THE WOMEN IN TURKEY ARE I WAS NOT AWARE THAT WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO BE SEEN BUT SINCE SUCH IS YOUR DESIRE I WILL CONFORM MYSELF TO IT
7434-75939-0014 PRAY DO NOT HESITATE IF YOU SHOULD WISH IT TO HAVE MY WINDOWS BARRED EVEN THIS REPARTEE WHICH MADE MONTALAIS AND DE GUICHE SMILE REKINDLED THE PRINCE'S ANGER NO INCONSIDERABLE PORTION OF WHICH HAD ALREADY EVAPORATED IN WORDS
7434-75939-0015 VERY WELL HE SAID IN A CONCENTRATED TONE OF VOICE THIS IS THE WAY IN WHICH I AM RESPECTED IN MY OWN HOUSE MONSEIGNEUR MONSEIGNEUR
7434-75939-0016 MURMURED THE CHEVALIER IN THE DUKE'S EAR IN SUCH A MANNER THAT EVERY ONE COULD OBSERVE HE WAS ENDEAVORING TO CALM HIM COME REPLIED THE PRINCE AS HIS ONLY ANSWER TO THE REMARK HURRYING HIM AWAY AND TURNING ROUND WITH SO HASTY A MOVEMENT THAT HE ALMOST RAN AGAINST MADAME
7434-75939-0017 THE CHEVALIER FOLLOWED HIM TO HIS OWN APARTMENT WHERE THE PRINCE HAD NO SOONER SEATED HIMSELF THAN HE GAVE FREE VENT TO HIS FURY THE CHEVALIER RAISED HIS EYES TOWARDS THE CEILING JOINED HIS HANDS TOGETHER AND SAID NOT A WORD GIVE ME YOUR OPINION EXCLAIMED THE PRINCE
7434-75939-0018 UPON WHAT UPON WHAT IS TAKING PLACE HERE OH MONSEIGNEUR IT IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER IT IS ABOMINABLE I CANNOT LIVE IN THIS MANNER HOW MISERABLE ALL THIS IS SAID THE CHEVALIER
7434-75939-0019 WE HOPED TO ENJOY TRANQUILLITY AFTER THAT MADMAN BUCKINGHAM HAD LEFT AND THIS IS WORSE I DO NOT SAY THAT MONSEIGNEUR YES BUT I SAY IT FOR BUCKINGHAM WOULD NEVER HAVE VENTURED UPON A FOURTH PART OF WHAT WE HAVE JUST NOW SEEN
7434-75939-0020 WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO CONCEAL ONESELF FOR THE PURPOSES OF DANCING AND TO FEIGN INDISPOSITION IN ORDER TO DINE TETE A TETE NO NO MONSEIGNEUR YES YES EXCLAIMED THE PRINCE EXCITING HIMSELF LIKE A SELF WILLED CHILD
7434-75939-0021 BUT I WILL NOT ENDURE IT ANY LONGER I MUST LEARN WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON OH MONSEIGNEUR AN EXPOSURE BY HEAVEN MONSIEUR SHALL I PUT MYSELF OUT OF THE WAY WHEN PEOPLE SHOW SO LITTLE CONSIDERATION FOR ME WAIT FOR ME HERE CHEVALIER WAIT FOR ME HERE
7434-75939-0022 ANNE OF AUSTRIA FELT THAT HER HAPPINESS WAS NOW COMPLETE PEACE RESTORED TO HER FAMILY A NATION DELIGHTED WITH THE PRESENCE OF A YOUNG MONARCH WHO HAD SHOWN AN APTITUDE FOR AFFAIRS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THE REVENUES OF THE STATE INCREASED EXTERNAL PEACE ASSURED
7434-75939-0023 EVERYTHING SEEMED TO PROMISE A TRANQUIL FUTURE HER THOUGHTS RECURRED NOW AND THEN TO THE POOR YOUNG NOBLEMAN WHOM SHE HAD RECEIVED AS A MOTHER AND HAD DRIVEN AWAY AS A HARD HEARTED STEP MOTHER AND SHE SIGHED AS SHE THOUGHT OF HIM
7434-75939-0024 DEAR MOTHER HE EXCLAIMED HURRIEDLY CLOSING THE DOOR THINGS CANNOT GO ON AS THEY ARE NOW ANNE OF AUSTRIA RAISED HER BEAUTIFUL EYES TOWARDS HIM AND WITH AN UNMOVED SUAVITY OF MANNER SAID WHAT DO YOU ALLUDE TO

7434-75939-0027 NO NO MADAME HAS SO MANAGED MATTERS THAT I AM STILL JEALOUS OF WHOM IN HEAVEN'S NAME IS IT POSSIBLE YOU HAVE NOT REMARKED IT
7434-75939-0028 THE QUEEN CLAPPED HER HANDS TOGETHER AND BEGAN TO LAUGH PHILIP SHE SAID YOUR JEALOUSY IS NOT MERELY A DEFECT IT IS A DISEASE WHETHER A DEFECT OR A DISEASE MADAME I AM THE SUFFERER FROM IT
7434-75939-0029 YOU WISH IT TO BE SAID YOU ARE RIGHT IN BEING JEALOUS WHEN THERE IS NO GROUND WHATEVER FOR YOUR JEALOUSY OF COURSE YOU WILL BEGIN TO SAY FOR THIS GENTLEMAN WHAT YOU ALREADY SAID ON THE BEHALF OF THE OTHER BECAUSE PHILIP SAID THE QUEEN DRYLY
7434-75939-0030 WHAT YOU DID FOR THE OTHER YOU ARE GOING TO DO FOR THIS ONE THE PRINCE BOWED SLIGHTLY ANNOYED IF I GIVE YOU FACTS HE SAID WILL YOU BELIEVE ME IF IT REGARDED ANYTHING ELSE BUT JEALOUSY I WOULD BELIEVE YOU WITHOUT YOUR BRINGING FACTS FORWARD
7434-75939-0031 BUT AS JEALOUSY IS THE CASE I PROMISE NOTHING IT IS JUST THE SAME AS IF YOUR MAJESTY WERE TO DESIRE ME TO HOLD MY TONGUE AND SENT ME AWAY UNHEARD FAR FROM IT YOU ARE MY SON I OWE YOU A MOTHER'S INDULGENCE OH SAY WHAT YOU THINK

7434-75939-0034 IF THEY WERE DOING ANY HARM THEY WOULD HIDE THEMSELVES VERY GOOD EXCLAIMED THE DUKE I EXPECTED YOU TO SAY THAT
7434-75939-0035 THIS MORNING I TOOK THEM BY SURPRISE AND SHOWED MY DISSATISFACTION IN A VERY MARKED MANNER RELY UPON IT THAT IS QUITE SUFFICIENT
7434-75939-0036 THESE YOUNG WOMEN EASILY TAKE OFFENSE TO REPROACH THEM FOR AN ERROR THEY HAVE NOT COMMITTED IS SOMETIMES ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO TELLING THEM THEY MIGHT BE GUILTY OF EVEN WORSE VERY GOOD VERY GOOD BUT WAIT A MINUTE DO NOT FORGET WHAT YOU HAVE JUST THIS MOMENT SAID
7434-75939-0037 YES I SAID SO WELL JUST NOW REPENTING OF MY HASTINESS OF THE MORNING AND IMAGINING THAT GUICHE WAS SULKING IN HIS OWN APARTMENTS I WENT TO PAY MADAME A VISIT CAN YOU GUESS WHAT OR WHOM I FOUND THERE ANOTHER SET OF MUSICIANS

7434-75939-0040 THAT BUCKINGHAM WAS ONLY A PRETEXT AND THAT GUICHE IS THE ONE WHO IS REALLY TO BLAME IN THE MATTER ANNE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS WELL SHE SAID WHAT ELSE I WISH DE GUICHE TO BE DISMISSED FROM MY HOUSEHOLD
7434-75939-0041 AS BUCKINGHAM WAS AND I SHALL ASK THE KING UNLESS UNLESS WHAT UNLESS YOU MY DEAR MOTHER WHO ARE SO CLEVER AND SO KIND WILL EXECUTE THE COMMISSION YOURSELF I WILL NOT DO IT PHILIP WHAT MADAME
7434-75939-0042 LISTEN PHILIP I AM NOT DISPOSED TO PAY PEOPLE ILL COMPLIMENTS EVERY DAY I HAVE SOME INFLUENCE OVER YOUNG PEOPLE BUT I CANNOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WITHOUT RUNNING THE CHANCES OF LOSING IT ALTOGETHER
7434-75939-0043 HE HAS DISPLEASED ME THAT IS YOUR OWN AFFAIR VERY WELL I KNOW WHAT I SHALL DO SAID THE PRINCE IMPETUOUSLY ANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITH SOME UNEASINESS
7434-75939-0044 I WILL HAVE HIM DROWNED IN MY FISH POND THE VERY NEXT TIME I FIND HIM IN MY APARTMENTS AGAIN HAVING LAUNCHED THIS TERRIBLE THREAT THE PRINCE EXPECTED HIS MOTHER WOULD BE FRIGHTENED OUT OF HER SENSES BUT THE QUEEN WAS UNMOVED DO SO SHE SAID
7434-75939-0045 PHILIP WAS AS WEAK AS A WOMAN AND BEGAN TO CRY OUT EVERY ONE BETRAYS ME NO ONE CARES FOR ME MY MOTHER EVEN JOINS MY ENEMIES
7434-75939-0046 YOUR MOTHER PHILIP SEES FURTHER IN THE MATTER THAN YOU DO AND DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ADVISING YOU SINCE YOU WILL NOT LISTEN TO HER I WILL GO TO THE KING I WAS ABOUT TO PROPOSE THAT TO YOU I AM NOW EXPECTING HIS MAJESTY
7434-75939-0047 IT IS THE HOUR HE USUALLY PAYS ME A VISIT EXPLAIN THE MATTER TO HIM YOURSELF
7434-75939-0048 AT THE SOUND OF THE KING'S FOOTSTEPS WHICH COULD BE HEARD UPON THE CARPET THE DUKE HURRIEDLY MADE HIS ESCAPE ANNE OF AUSTRIA COULD NOT RESIST LAUGHING AND WAS LAUGHING STILL WHEN THE KING ENTERED
7434-75939-0049 HE CAME VERY AFFECTIONATELY TO INQUIRE AFTER THE EVEN NOW UNCERTAIN HEALTH OF THE QUEEN MOTHER AND TO ANNOUNCE TO HER THAT THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY TO FONTAINEBLEAU WERE COMPLETE SEEING HER LAUGH HIS UNEASINESS ON HER ACCOUNT DIMINISHED
7434-75939-0050 AND HE ADDRESSED HER IN A VIVACIOUS TONE HIMSELF ANNE OF AUSTRIA TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND IN A VOICE FULL OF PLAYFULNESS SAID DO YOU KNOW SIRE THAT I AM PROUD OF BEING A SPANISH WOMAN WHY MADAME
7434-75939-0051 BECAUSE SPANISH WOMEN ARE WORTH MORE THAN ENGLISH WOMEN AT LEAST EXPLAIN YOURSELF SINCE YOUR MARRIAGE YOU HAVE NOT I BELIEVE HAD A SINGLE REPROACH TO MAKE AGAINST THE QUEEN CERTAINLY NOT
7434-75939-0052 AND YOU TOO HAVE BEEN MARRIED SOME TIME YOUR BROTHER ON THE CONTRARY HAS BEEN MARRIED BUT A FORTNIGHT WELL HE IS NOW FINDING FAULT WITH MADAME A SECOND TIME WHAT BUCKINGHAM STILL NO ANOTHER WHO
7434-75939-0053 GUICHE REALLY MADAME IS A COQUETTE THEN I FEAR SO MY POOR BROTHER SAID THE KING LAUGHING YOU DON'T OBJECT TO COQUETTES IT SEEMS IN MADAME CERTAINLY I DO
7434-75939-0054 BUT MADAME IS NOT A COQUETTE AT HEART THAT MAY BE BUT YOUR BROTHER IS EXCESSIVELY ANGRY ABOUT IT WHAT DOES HE WANT
7434-75939-0055 THAT IS A VIOLENT MEASURE TO RESORT TO DO NOT LAUGH HE IS EXTREMELY IRRITATED THINK OF WHAT CAN BE DONE TO SAVE GUICHE CERTAINLY OF IF YOUR BROTHER HEARD YOU
7434-75939-0056 HE WOULD CONSPIRE AGAINST YOU AS YOUR UNCLE DID AGAINST YOUR FATHER NO PHILIP HAS TOO MUCH AFFECTION FOR ME FOR THAT AND I ON MY SIDE HAVE TOO GREAT A REGARD FOR HIM WE SHALL LIVE TOGETHER ON VERY GOOD TERMS BUT WHAT IS THE SUBSTANCE OF HIS REQUEST
7434-75939-0057 THAT YOU WILL PREVENT MADAME FROM BEING A COQUETTE AND GUICHE FROM BEING AMIABLE IS THAT ALL MY BROTHER HAS AN EXALTED IDEA OF SOVEREIGN POWER TO REFORM A MAN NOT TO SPEAK ABOUT REFORMING A WOMAN HOW WILL YOU SET ABOUT IT
7434-75939-0058 WITH A WORD TO GUICHE WHO IS A CLEVER FELLOW I WILL UNDERTAKE TO CONVINCE HIM BUT MADAME THAT IS MORE DIFFICULT A WORD WILL NOT BE ENOUGH I WILL COMPOSE A HOMILY AND READ IT TO HER THERE IS NO TIME TO BE LOST
7434-75939-0059 OH I WILL USE THE UTMOST DILIGENCE THERE IS A REPETITION OF THE BALLET THIS AFTERNOON YOU WILL READ HER A LECTURE WHILE YOU ARE DANCING YES MADAME YOU PROMISE TO CONVERT HER
7434-75939-0060 I WILL ROOT OUT THE HERESY ALTOGETHER EITHER BY CONVINCING HER OR BY EXTREME MEASURES THAT IS ALL RIGHT THEN DO NOT MIX ME UP IN THE AFFAIR
7434-75939-0061 THE KING MADAME WILL TAKE ALL UPON HIMSELF BUT LET ME REFLECT WHAT ABOUT IT WOULD BE BETTER PERHAPS IF I WERE TO GO AND SEE MADAME IN HER OWN APARTMENT WOULD THAT NOT SEEM A SOMEWHAT SERIOUS STEP TO TAKE
7434-75939-0062 YES BUT SERIOUSNESS IS NOT UNBECOMING IN PREACHERS AND THE MUSIC OF THE BALLET WOULD DROWN HALF MY ARGUMENTS BESIDES THE OBJECT IS TO PREVENT ANY VIOLENT MEASURES ON MY BROTHER'S PART SO THAT A LITTLE PRECIPITATION MAY BE ADVISABLE
7434-75939-0063 IS MADAME IN HER OWN APARTMENT I BELIEVE SO WHAT IS MY STATEMENT OF GRIEVANCES TO CONSIST OF IN A FEW WORDS OF THE FOLLOWING MUSIC UNINTERRUPTEDLY GUICHE'S ASSIDUITY
7434-75939-0064 SUSPICIONS OF TREASONABLE PLOTS AND PRACTICES AND THE PROOFS THERE ARE NONE VERY WELL I WILL GO AT ONCE TO SEE MADAME THE KING TURNED TO LOOK IN THE MIRRORS AT HIS COSTUME WHICH WAS VERY RICH
7434-75939-0065 AND HIS FACE WHICH WAS RADIANT AS THE MORNING I SUPPOSE MY BROTHER IS KEPT A LITTLE AT A DISTANCE SAID THE KING FIRE AND WATER CANNOT BE MORE OPPOSITE THAT WILL DO
7434-75939-0066 PERMIT ME MADAME TO KISS YOUR HANDS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HANDS IN FRANCE MAY YOU BE SUCCESSFUL SIRE AS THE FAMILY PEACEMAKER I DO NOT EMPLOY AN AMBASSADOR SAID LOUIS
