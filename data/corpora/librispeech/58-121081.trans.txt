58-121081-0000 AND YET ASTONISHED EVEN UNEASY THOUGH THEY WERE THEY STILL FELT THAT THEY WOULD NOT LIKE TO BE ABSENT THE RECENT EVENTS THE SOLITARY AND ECCENTRIC POSITION OF THE COUNT HIS ENORMOUS NAY ALMOST INCREDIBLE FORTUNE
58-121081-0001 AND ALL PRESENT EVEN INCLUDING CAVALCANTI AND HIS SON NOTWITHSTANDING THE STIFFNESS OF THE ONE AND THE CARELESSNESS OF THE OTHER WERE THOUGHTFUL ON FINDING THEMSELVES ASSEMBLED AT THE HOUSE OF THIS INCOMPREHENSIBLE MAN
58-121081-0002 ON THE COUNT'S INVITATION OFFERED HIS ARM
58-121081-0003 WHEN HE FELT THE ARM OF THE BARONESS PRESS UPON HIS OWN NONE OF THIS HAD ESCAPED THE COUNT AND EVEN BY THIS MERE CONTACT OF INDIVIDUALS THE SCENE HAD ALREADY ACQUIRED CONSIDERABLE INTEREST FOR AN OBSERVER
58-121081-0004 THE REPAST WAS MAGNIFICENT MONTE CRISTO HAD ENDEAVORED COMPLETELY TO OVERTURN THE PARISIAN IDEAS
58-121081-0005 BUT OF SUCH A KIND AS THE ARABIAN FAIRIES MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO PREPARE EVERY DELICIOUS FRUIT THAT THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THE GLOBE COULD PROVIDE WAS HEAPED IN VASES FROM CHINA AND JARS FROM JAPAN
58-121081-0006 RARE BIRDS RETAINING THEIR MOST BRILLIANT PLUMAGE ENORMOUS FISH SPREAD UPON MASSIVE SILVER DISHES TOGETHER WITH EVERY WINE PRODUCED IN THE ARCHIPELAGO ASIA MINOR OR THE CAPE
58-121081-0007 SPARKLING IN BOTTLES WHOSE GROTESQUE SHAPE SEEMED TO GIVE AN ADDITIONAL FLAVOR TO THE DRAUGHT ALL THESE LIKE ONE OF THE DISPLAYS WITH WHICH APICIUS OF OLD GRATIFIED HIS GUESTS PASSED IN REVIEW BEFORE THE EYES OF THE ASTONISHED PARISIANS
58-121081-0008 WHO UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO EXPEND A THOUSAND LOUIS UPON A DINNER FOR TEN PERSONS BUT ONLY ON THE CONDITION OF EATING PEARLS LIKE CLEOPATRA OR DRINKING REFINED GOLD LIKE LORENZO DE MEDICI
58-121081-0009 MONTE CRISTO NOTICED THE GENERAL ASTONISHMENT AND BEGAN LAUGHING AND JOKING ABOUT IT GENTLEMEN HE SAID YOU WILL ADMIT THAT WHEN ARRIVED AT A CERTAIN DEGREE OF FORTUNE THE SUPERFLUITIES OF LIFE ARE ALL THAT CAN BE DESIRED
58-121081-0010 WHAT IS IT THAT WE REALLY DESIRE THAT WHICH WE CANNOT OBTAIN NOW TO SEE THINGS WHICH I CANNOT UNDERSTAND TO PROCURE IMPOSSIBILITIES THESE ARE THE STUDY OF MY LIFE I GRATIFY MY WISHES BY TWO MEANS
58-121081-0011 A CULPRIT TO DEATH YOU M DEBRAY IN PACIFYING A KINGDOM
58-121081-0012 AND YOU MORREL IN BREAKING A HORSE THAT NO ONE CAN RIDE FOR EXAMPLE YOU SEE THESE TWO FISH
58-121081-0013 THE OTHER FIVE LEAGUES FROM NAPLES IS IT NOT AMUSING TO SEE THEM BOTH ON THE SAME TABLE WHAT ARE THE TWO FISH ASKED DANGLARS
58-121081-0014 AND MAJOR CAVALCANTI WHO IS AN ITALIAN WILL TELL YOU THE NAME OF THE OTHER THIS ONE IS I THINK A STERLET SAID CHATEAU RENAUD AND THAT ONE IF I MISTAKE NOT A LAMPREY JUST SO
58-121081-0015 NOW M DANGLARS ASK THESE GENTLEMEN WHERE THEY ARE CAUGHT STERLETS SAID CHATEAU RENAUD ARE ONLY FOUND IN THE VOLGA AND SAID CAVALCANTI I KNOW THAT LAKE FUSARO ALONE SUPPLIES LAMPREYS OF THAT SIZE
58-121081-0016 EXACTLY ONE COMES FROM THE VOLGA AND THE OTHER FROM LAKE FUSARO IMPOSSIBLE CRIED ALL THE GUESTS SIMULTANEOUSLY WELL THIS IS JUST WHAT AMUSES ME SAID MONTE CRISTO I AM LIKE NERO CUPITOR IMPOSSIBILIUM
58-121081-0017 AND THAT IS WHAT IS AMUSING YOU AT THIS MOMENT THIS FISH WHICH SEEMS SO EXQUISITE TO YOU IS VERY LIKELY NO BETTER THAN PERCH OR SALMON
58-121081-0018 AND HERE IT IS BUT HOW COULD YOU HAVE THESE FISH BROUGHT TO FRANCE OH NOTHING MORE EASY EACH FISH WAS BROUGHT OVER IN A CASK ONE FILLED WITH RIVER HERBS AND WEEDS THE OTHER WITH RUSHES AND LAKE PLANTS
58-121081-0019 THEY WERE PLACED IN A WAGON BUILT ON PURPOSE AND THUS THE STERLET LIVED TWELVE DAYS THE LAMPREY EIGHT AND BOTH WERE ALIVE WHEN MY COOK SEIZED THEM KILLING ONE WITH MILK AND THE OTHER WITH WINE YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME M DANGLARS
58-121081-0020 FOUR SERVANTS CARRIED IN TWO CASKS COVERED WITH AQUATIC PLANTS AND IN EACH OF WHICH WAS BREATHING A FISH SIMILAR TO THOSE ON THE TABLE
58-121081-0021 MERELY BECAUSE ONE MIGHT HAVE DIED CARELESSLY ANSWERED MONTE CRISTO YOU ARE CERTAINLY AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN SAID DANGLARS AND PHILOSOPHERS MAY WELL SAY IT IS A FINE THING TO BE RICH AND TO HAVE IDEAS ADDED MADAME DANGLARS
58-121081-0022 OH DO NOT GIVE ME CREDIT FOR THIS MADAME IT WAS DONE BY THE ROMANS WHO MUCH ESTEEMED THEM AND PLINY RELATES THAT THEY SENT SLAVES FROM OSTIA TO ROME WHO CARRIED ON THEIR HEADS FISH WHICH HE CALLS THE MULUS AND WHICH FROM THE DESCRIPTION MUST PROBABLY BE THE GOLDFISH
58-121081-0023 IT WAS ALSO CONSIDERED A LUXURY TO HAVE THEM ALIVE IT BEING AN AMUSING SIGHT TO SEE THEM DIE FOR WHEN DYING THEY CHANGE COLOR THREE OR FOUR TIMES AND LIKE THE RAINBOW WHEN IT DISAPPEARS PASS THROUGH ALL THE PRISMATIC SHADES AFTER WHICH THEY WERE SENT TO THE KITCHEN
58-121081-0024 THEIR AGONY FORMED PART OF THEIR MERIT IF THEY WERE NOT SEEN ALIVE THEY WERE DESPISED WHEN DEAD YES SAID DEBRAY BUT THEN OSTIA IS ONLY A FEW LEAGUES FROM ROME TRUE SAID MONTE CRISTO
58-121081-0025 YES SAID MADAME DE VILLEFORT THE DOOR WAS TOWARDS THE ROAD BEFORE AND ON THE DAY OF MY MIRACULOUS ESCAPE YOU BROUGHT ME INTO THE HOUSE FROM THE ROAD I REMEMBER YES MADAME SAID MONTE CRISTO
58-121081-0026 I RECOLLECT COMING FOR MY MOTHER TO LOOK AT IT WHEN M DE SAINT MERAN ADVERTISED IT FOR SALE TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO
58-121081-0027 IT LOOKED SO GLOOMY I SHOULD NEVER HAVE BOUGHT IT IF MY STEWARD HAD NOT TAKEN THE MATTER INTO HIS OWN HANDS PERHAPS THE FELLOW HAD BEEN BRIBED BY THE NOTARY
58-121081-0028 AN IDEA WHICH CARRIES YOU BACK TO OTHER TIMES TO OTHER PLACES WHICH VERY LIKELY HAVE NO CONNECTION WITH THE PRESENT TIME AND PLACE
58-121081-0029 AND THEN WE WILL TAKE COFFEE IN THE GARDEN AFTER DINNER THE PLAY MONTE CRISTO LOOKED INQUIRINGLY AT HIS GUESTS
58-121081-0030 MONTE CRISTO DID THE SAME AND THE REST FOLLOWED THEIR EXAMPLE
58-121081-0031 WERE ALREADY SCATTERED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE HOUSE FOR THEY THOUGHT THE VISIT WOULD NOT BE LIMITED TO THE ONE ROOM AND THAT AT THE SAME TIME THEY WOULD OBTAIN A VIEW OF THE REST OF THE BUILDING OF WHICH MONTE CRISTO HAD CREATED A PALACE EACH ONE WENT OUT BY THE OPEN DOORS
58-121081-0032 MONTE CRISTO WAITED FOR THE TWO WHO REMAINED THEN WHEN THEY HAD PASSED HE BROUGHT UP THE REAR AND ON HIS FACE WAS A SMILE
58-121081-0033 WOULD HAVE ALARMED THEM MUCH MORE THAN A VISIT TO THE ROOM THEY WERE ABOUT TO ENTER THEY BEGAN BY WALKING THROUGH THE APARTMENTS MANY OF WHICH WERE FITTED UP IN THE EASTERN STYLE WITH CUSHIONS AND DIVANS INSTEAD OF BEDS AND PIPES INSTEAD OF FURNITURE
58-121081-0034 THE DRAWING ROOMS WERE DECORATED WITH THE RAREST PICTURES BY THE OLD MASTERS THE BOUDOIRS HUNG WITH DRAPERIES FROM CHINA OF FANCIFUL COLORS FANTASTIC DESIGN AND WONDERFUL TEXTURE AT LENGTH THEY ARRIVED AT THE FAMOUS ROOM
58-121081-0035 THERE WAS NOTHING PARTICULAR ABOUT IT EXCEPTING THAT ALTHOUGH DAYLIGHT HAD DISAPPEARED IT WAS NOT LIGHTED AND EVERYTHING IN IT WAS OLD FASHIONED WHILE THE REST OF THE ROOMS HAD BEEN REDECORATED THESE TWO CAUSES WERE ENOUGH TO GIVE IT A GLOOMY ASPECT
58-121081-0036 MANY OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE THE IMPORT OF WHICH WAS A UNANIMOUS OPINION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING SINISTER ABOUT THE ROOM IS IT NOT SO ASKED MONTE CRISTO LOOK AT THAT LARGE CLUMSY BED HUNG WITH SUCH GLOOMY BLOOD COLORED DRAPERY
58-121081-0037 AND THOSE TWO CRAYON PORTRAITS THAT HAVE FADED FROM THE DAMPNESS DO THEY NOT SEEM TO SAY WITH THEIR PALE LIPS AND STARING EYES WE HAVE SEEN VILLEFORT BECAME LIVID
58-121081-0038 MADAME DANGLARS FELL INTO A LONG SEAT PLACED NEAR THE CHIMNEY OH SAID MADAME DE VILLEFORT SMILING ARE YOU COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO SIT DOWN UPON THE VERY SEAT PERHAPS UPON WHICH THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED MADAME DANGLARS ROSE SUDDENLY
58-121081-0039 AND THEN SAID MONTE CRISTO THIS IS NOT ALL WHAT IS THERE MORE SAID DEBRAY WHO HAD NOT FAILED TO NOTICE THE AGITATION OF MADAME DANGLARS

58-121081-0046 AH YES SAID MONTE CRISTO SMILING IT IS ALL A MATTER OF IMAGINATION WHY SHOULD WE NOT IMAGINE THIS THE APARTMENT OF AN HONEST MOTHER AND THIS BED WITH RED HANGINGS A BED VISITED BY THE GODDESS LUCINA
58-121081-0047 AND THAT MYSTERIOUS STAIRCASE THE PASSAGE THROUGH WHICH NOT TO DISTURB THEIR SLEEP THE DOCTOR AND NURSE PASS OR EVEN THE FATHER CARRYING THE SLEEPING CHILD
58-121081-0048 UTTERED A GROAN AND FAINTED
58-121081-0049 SHE PASSED OVER TO MONTE CRISTO A BOTTLE FULL OF THE SAME KIND OF RED LIQUID WHOSE GOOD PROPERTIES THE COUNT HAD TESTED ON EDWARD AH SAID MONTE CRISTO TAKING IT FROM HER HAND YES SHE SAID AT YOUR ADVICE I HAVE MADE THE TRIAL
58-121081-0050 AND HAVE YOU SUCCEEDED I THINK SO
58-121081-0051 BUT AS HE WAS NOT ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN POETICAL IDEAS HE HAD GONE INTO THE GARDEN AND WAS TALKING WITH MAJOR CAVALCANTI ON THE PROJECTED RAILWAY FROM LEGHORN TO FLORENCE MONTE CRISTO SEEMED IN DESPAIR
58-121081-0052 REALLY MADAME HE SAID DID I ALARM YOU MUCH OH NO SIR SHE ANSWERED BUT YOU KNOW THINGS IMPRESS US DIFFERENTLY ACCORDING TO THE MOOD OF OUR MINDS
