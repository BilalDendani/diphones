6206-14958-0000 THE PLEASANT AROMAS OF COFFEE AND SAUSAGES WERE MINGLING IN THE AIR WHEN GUARDY LUD WOKE UP AND LOOKED ABOUT THE OLD FASHIONED ROOM WITH A SENSE OF SATISFACTION THE VERY PICTURES ON THE WALLS RESTED HIM THEY REMINDED HIM SO MUCH OF THE ROOMS IN HIS BOYHOOD HOME
6206-14958-0001 HE HAD A FEELING THAT OLD FASHIONED THINGS WERE BEST AND IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT HE OWNED A HOUSE MOST DIFFERENT FROM THIS ONE HIMSELF AND KNEW THAT HIS WIFE WOULD NOT FOR A MINUTE HAVE TOLERATED ANY OLD FASHIONED THINGS ABOUT
6206-14958-0002 BUT HIS WIFE WAS NOT SO MINDED AND THAT ENDED IT BUT IT ROLLED A GREAT BURDEN FROM HIS SHOULDERS TO FEEL THAT HE MIGHT LEAVE THEM IN SUCH CAPABLE HANDS THEY HAD A ROLLICKING TIME AT BREAKFAST FOR GUARDY LUD WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE CRISP BROWN SAUSAGES
6206-14958-0003 FRIED POTATOES AND BUCKWHEATS WITH REAL MAPLE SYRUP AND HE LAUGHED AND ATE AND TOLD STORIES WITH THE CHILDREN AND KEPT THE OLD DINING ROOM WALLS RINGING WITH JOY AS THEY HAD NOT RESOUNDED WITHIN THE MEMORY OF JULIA CLOUD THEN SUDDENLY THE DOOR OPENED
6206-14958-0004 AND A GLANCE AT THE KIND STRONG FACE OF THE WHITE HAIRED MAN GAVE HER COURAGE ELLEN COULD NOT REALLY SPOIL THEIR PLANS WITH HIM THERE HE FELT THAT THE ARRANGEMENT WAS GOOD AND WITH HIM TO BACK HER SHE FELT SHE COULD STAND OUT AGAINST ANY ARGUMENTS HER SISTER MIGHT BRING FORTH
6206-14958-0005 SO SHE ROSE WITH A NATURAL EASE AND INTRODUCED HER MY SISTER MISSUS ROBINSON MISTER LUDDINGTON AND ELLEN STIFFLY AND STILL DISAPPROVINGLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE INTRODUCTION I WON'T INTERRUPT SHE SAID DISAGREEABLY
6206-14958-0006 I'M JUST GOING UP TO LOOK OVER SOME OF MY MOTHER'S THINGS AND SHE TURNED TO THE BACK STAIRWAY AND WENT UP CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HER MISTER LUDDINGTON GAZED AFTER HER A SECOND AND THEN TAKING HIS GLASSES OFF AND WIPING THEM ENERGETICALLY HE REMARKED
6206-14958-0007 WELL WELL BLESS MY SOUL IT MUST BE GETTING LATE WE'VE HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME I DIDN'T REALIZE THOSE CERTAINLY WERE GOOD BUCKWHEATS MISS CLOUD I SHAN'T FORGET THEM VERY SOON
6206-14958-0008 AND HE CAST AN ANXIOUS GLANCE TOWARD THE STAIR DOOR AGAIN JULIA CLOUD SMILED UNDERSTANDINGLY AND USHERED THEM INTO THE LITTLE PARLOR ABLAZE WITH FALL SUNSHINE ITS WINDOWS WREATHED ABOUT WITH CRIMSONING WOODBINE
6206-14958-0009 AND AS SHE CAUGHT THE GLOW AND GLINT FROM THE WINDOW SHE REMEMBERED THE GRAY EVENING WHEN SHE HAD LOOKED OUT ACROSS INTO HER FUTURE AS SHE SUPPOSED IT WOULD BE HOW BEAUTIFUL AND WONDERFUL THAT THE GRAY HAD CHANGED TO GLOW
6206-14958-0010 AS SHE SAT DOWN TO ENTER INTO THE CONTRACT THAT WAS TO BIND HER TO A NEW AND WONDERFUL LIFE WITH GREAT RESPONSIBILITIES AND LARGE POSSIBILITIES HER HEART ACCUSTOMED TO LOOK UPWARD SENT A WHISPER OF THANKSGIVING HEAVENWARD
6206-14958-0011 THE DETAILS DID NOT TAKE LONG AFTER ALL FOR MISTER LUDDINGTON WAS A KEEN BUSINESS MAN AND HE HAD GONE OVER THE WHOLE PROPOSITION AND HAD THE PLAN IN WRITING FOR HER TO SIGN TELLING JUST WHAT WERE HER DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES WITH REGARD TO HIS WARDS
6206-14958-0012 AND I DECLARE I NEVER LAID EYES ON A WOMAN THAT I THOUGHT COULD FILL THE PART BETTER JULIA CLOUD WAS QUITE OVERWHELMED BUT THE MATTER OF THE SALARY TROUBLED HER I THINK IT SHOULD NOT BE A MATTER OF MONEY SHE DEMURRED I WOULD RATHER DO IT FOR LOVE YOU KNOW
6206-14958-0013 LOVE'S ALL RIGHT SAID THE OLD MAN SMILING BUT THIS THING HAS GOT TO BE ON A BUSINESS BASIS OR THE TERMS OF THE WILL WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO AGREE TO IT YOU SEE WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO UNDERTAKE MEANS WORK AND IT MEANS STICKING TO IT
6206-14958-0014 AND YOU DESERVE PAY FOR IT AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT SEVERAL OF THE BEST YEARS OUT OF YOUR LIFE FOR NOTHING BESIDES YOU'VE GOT TO FEEL FREE TO GIVE UP THE JOB IF IT PROVES TOO BURDENSOME FOR YOU AND YOU TO DISMISS ME IF I DO NOT PROVE CAPABLE FOR THE POSITION SUGGESTED JULIA CLOUD
6206-14958-0015 LIFTING MEEK AND HONEST EYES TO MEET HIS GAZE WELL WELL WELL I CAN SEE THERE WON'T BE ANY NEED OF THAT SPUTTERED THE OLD GENTLEMAN PLEASANTLY BUT HOWEVER THAT IS THIS IS THE CONTRACT I'VE MADE OUT AND I'M QUITE SATISFIED SO ARE THE CHILDREN
6206-14958-0016 ARE YOU WILLING TO SIGN IT OF COURSE THERE'S A CLAUSE IN THERE ABOUT REASONABLE NOTICE IF THERE IS DISSATISFACTION ON EITHER SIDE THAT LETS YOU OUT AT ANY TIME YOU GET TIRED OF IT ONLY GIVE ME A CHANCE TO LOOK AFTER THESE YOUNGSTERS PROPERLY
6206-14958-0017 JULIA CLOUD TOOK THE PEN EAGERLY TREMBLINGLY A SENSE OF WONDER IN HER POUNDING HEART AND SIGNED HER NAME JUST AS ELLEN'S HEAVY FOOTSTEPS COULD BE HEARD POUNDING DOWN THE BACK STAIRS
6206-14958-0018 AND THEN THREW OPEN THE PARLOR DOOR IN THE NICK OF TIME TO SAVE HER AUNT ELLEN FROM SEEMING TO BE DESERTED ELLEN ROBINSON APPEARED ON THE SCENE JUST IN TIME TO WITNESS THE HEARTY HAND SHAKE THAT GUARDY LUD GAVE JULIA CLOUD AS HE PICKED UP THE PAPERS AND WENT UP STAIRS FOR HIS SUITCASE
6206-14958-0019 WHILE ALLISON WENT AFTER THE CAR TO TAKE HIM TO THE TRAIN IS THAT MAN MARRIED BECAUSE IF HE ISN'T I DON'T THINK IT'S RESPECTABLE FOR YOU TO GO AND LIVE NEAR HIM DECLARED ELLEN IN A PENETRATING VOICE TO THE INTENSE DISTRESS OF JULIA CLOUD WHO WAS HAPPILY HURRYING THE DISHES FROM THE BREAKFAST TABLE
6206-14958-0020 BUT LESLIE CAME TO THE RESCUE OH INDEED AUNT ELLEN HE'S VERY MUCH MARRIED ALTOGETHER TOO MUCH MARRIED FOR COMFORT HE WOULD BE A DEAR IF IT WASN'T FOR HIS SILLY LITTLE OLD BOSSY WIFE BUT HE DOESN'T INTEND TO LIVE ANYWHERE NEAR US HIS HOME IS OFF IN CALIFORNIA

6206-14958-0022 JULIA CLOUD BADE MISTER LUDDINGTON GOOD BY STANDING ON HER OWN FRONT STEPS AND THEN WAITED A MOMENT LOOKING OFF TOWARD THE HILLS WHICH HAD SHUT IN HER VISION ALL HER LIFE THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE HAD RUSHED DOWN TO THE CAR AND WERE PULLING THEIR GUARDIAN JOYOUSLY INSIDE
6206-14958-0023 THEY SEEMED TO DO EVERYTHING JOYOUSLY LIKE TWO YOUNG CREATURES LET OUT OF PRISON INTO THE SUNSHINE JULIA CLOUD SMILED AT THE THOUGHT OF THEM BUT HER SOUL WAS NOT WATCHING THEM JUST THEN SHE WAS LOOKING OFF TO THE HILLS THAT HAD BEEN HER STRENGTH ALL THE YEARS THROUGH SO MANY TRIALS
6206-14958-0024 ACROSS THE ROAD BEHIND HER PARLOR CURTAINS MISSUS PERKINS WAS KEEPING LOOKOUT AND REMARKING TO A NEIGHBOR WHO HAD RUN IN YES I THOUGHT AS MUCH THERE'S ALWAYS A MAN IN THE CASE WHEN A WOMAN ACTS QUEER NOW DOESN'T THAT BEAT ALL DO YOU SUPPOSE HE'S A LONG LOST LOVER OR SOMETHING
6206-14958-0025 WELL I WONDER WHAT HER MOTHER WOULD THINK JULIA CLOUD WENT SLOWLY BACK TO THE DINING ROOM WHERE ELLEN WAS SEATED ON THE COUCH WAITING LIKE A VISITOR JULIA'S SMILE WAS UTTERLY LOST ON HER GLUM COUNTENANCE WHICH RESEMBLED AN EMBATTLED TOWER UNDER SIEGE
6206-14958-0026 WELL SHE SAID AS JULIA BEGAN TO GATHER UP MORE DISHES FROM THE BREAKFAST TABLE I SUPPOSE YOU THINK YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING SMART NOW DON'T YOU GETTING THAT OLD SNOB HERE AND FIXING THINGS ALL UP WITHOUT CONSULTING ANY OF YOUR RELATIVES REALLY ELLEN
6206-14958-0027 THIS HAS ALL BEEN SO SUDDEN THAT I HAD NO OPPORTUNITY SAID JULIA GENTLY BUT IT DID NOT SEEM LIKELY THAT YOU WOULD OBJECT FOR YOU SUGGESTED YOURSELF THAT I RENT THE HOUSE AND YOU SAID YOU DID NOT WANT ME TO STAY HERE ALONE THIS SEEMED QUITE PROVIDENTIAL
6206-14958-0028 PROVIDENTIAL SNIFFED ELLEN PROVIDENTIAL TO TAKE YOU AWAY FROM YOUR OWN HOME AND YOUR OWN PEOPLE AND SEND YOU OUT INTO A WORLD WHERE NOBODY REALLY CARES FOR YOU AND WHERE ALL THEY WANT OF YOU IS TO MAKE A DRUDGE OF YOU YOU CALL THAT PROVIDENTIAL DO YOU
6206-14958-0029 AND TRY TO SAVE YOU FROM YOURSELF AND OFFER YOU A GOOD HOME WHERE YOU WILL BE CARED FOR ALL THE REST OF YOUR DAYS RIGHT AMONG YOUR OWN WHERE MOTHER WOULD HAVE WANTED TO SEE YOU YOU WILL PROBABLY GET HIGH HEADED AND SAY I AM INTERFERING WITH YOUR RIGHTS BUT I CAN'T HELP IT I'VE GOT TO SPEAK
6206-14958-0030 TO HANG YOURSELF WITHOUT DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO STOP IT MY OWN SISTER WHY ELLEN DEAR SAID JULIA CLOUD EAGERLY SITTING DOWN BESIDE HER SISTER YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IT ISN'T IN THE LEAST THAT WAY I'M SORRY I HAD TO SPRING IT ON YOU SO SUDDENLY
6206-14958-0031 AND GIVE YOU SUCH A WRONG IMPRESSION YOU KNOW I COULDN'T THINK OF COMING TO LIVE ON YOU AND HERBERT IT WAS KIND OF YOU TO SUGGEST IT AND I AM GRATEFUL AND ALL THAT BUT I KNOW HOW IT WOULD BE TO HAVE SOME ONE ELSE EVEN A SISTER COME INTO THE HOME AND I COULDN'T THINK OF IT
6206-14958-0032 I HAVE ALWAYS RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NEVER BE DEPENDENT ON MY RELATIVES WHILE I HAD MY HEALTH ELLEN SAT UP BRISTLING AND YET YOU ARE WILLING TO GO AWAY TO SOME STRANGE PLACE WHERE NOBODY KNOWS YOU AND SLAVE FOR A COUPLE OF LITTLE SNOBS O ELLEN SAID JULIA PLEADINGLY
6206-14958-0033 I'M JUST GOING TO BE A SORT OF MOTHER TO THEM AND YOU OUGHTN'T TO CALL THEM SNOBS THEY ARE YOUR OWN BROTHER'S CHILDREN OWN BROTHER'S CHILDREN NOTHING SNEERED ELLEN HE'S BEEN AWAY SO MANY YEARS HE WAS JUST LIKE A STRANGER WHEN HE CAME BACK THE LAST TIME
6206-14958-0034 AND AS FOR THE CHILDREN THEY ARE JUST LIKE HIS STUCK UP WIFE AND HER FAMILY YET YOU'LL LEAVE THE CHILDREN THAT WERE BORN AND RAISED CLOSE BESIDE YOU AND GO AND SLAVE FOR THEM MOTHER FIDDLESTICKS YOU'LL SLAVE ALL RIGHT I KNOW YOU
6206-14958-0035 IN SIX WEEKS YOU'LL BE A DRUDGE FOR THEM THE WAY YOU'VE BEEN ALL YOUR LIFE I KNOW HOW IT IS AND YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE IT BUT I HAVE FEELINGS FOR MY SISTER AND I DON'T LIKE TO SEE HER PUT UPON ELLEN FUMBLED FOR HER HANDKERCHIEF AND MANAGED A COMELY TEAR OR TWO THAT QUITE TOUCHED JULIA'S HEART
6206-14958-0036 AFFECTION BETWEEN THEM EVEN WHEN ELLEN WAS A CHILD HAD BEEN QUITE ONE SIDED FOR ELLEN HAD ALWAYS BEEN A SELFISH SPOILED LITTLE THING AND JULIA HAD LOOKED IN VAIN FOR ANY SIGNS OF TENDERNESS NOW HER HEART WARMED TOWARD HER YOUNGER SISTER IN THIS LONG DELAYED THOUGHTFULNESS
6206-14958-0037 AND HER TONE GREW GENTLER THAT'S DEAR OF YOU ELLEN AND I APPRECIATE IT BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND YET I SEE I'M NOT TO BE A WORKER NOR EVEN A HOUSEKEEPER I'M TO BE JUST A SORT OF MOTHER OR AUNT IF YOU PLEASE
6206-14958-0038 ALTHOUGH I'M SURE ONE SERVANT WILL BE ALL THAT I SHALL WANT IN A LITTLE HOUSEHOLD LIKE THAT BUT MISTER LUDDINGTON QUITE INSISTED THERE SHOULD BE SERVANTS AND THAT NO WORK OF ANY SORT SHOULD FALL UPON ME HE SAID THAT AS THEIR NEAREST RELATIVE I WAS TO BE IN THE POSITION OF MOTHER AND GUARDIAN TO THEM
6206-14958-0039 AND TO PRESIDE OVER THEIR HOME THAT'S RIDICULOUS PUT IN ELLEN WHY DON'T THEY GO TO COLLEGE AND BOARD LIKE ANY OTHER REASONABLE YOUNG FOLKS IF THEY MUST GO TO COLLEGE AT ALL I THINK IT'S ALL NONSENSE FOR EM TO GO WHAT DO THEY DO IT FOR THEY'VE GOT MONEY
6206-14958-0040 THEY'VE GOT ENOUGH NOW TO GET ALONG THAT GIRL THINKS SHE'S TOO SMART TO LIVE I CALL HER IMPUDENT FOR MY PART THEY WANT A HOME SAID JULIA WAIVING THE SUBJECT OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND THEY HAVE CHOSEN ME AND I MEAN TO DO MY BEST
6206-14958-0041 THERE WAS A QUIET FINALITY IN HER TONE THAT IMPRESSED HER SISTER SHE LOOKED AT HER ANGRILY WELL IF YOU WILL YOU WILL I SUPPOSE NOBODY CAN STOP YOU BUT I SEE JUST WHAT WILL COME OF IT YOU'LL FOOL AWAY A LITTLE WHILE THERE
6206-14958-0042 AND FIND OUT HOW MISTAKEN YOU WERE AND THEN YOU'LL COME BACK TO HERBERT TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND YOU DON'T REALIZE HOW OFFENDED HERBERT IS GOING TO BE BY YOUR ACTIONS AND HOW HE'LL FEEL ABOUT LETTING YOU COME BACK AFTER YOU HAVE GONE AWAY IN SUCH HIGH FEATHER YOU HAVEN'T ANYTHING TO SPEAK OF TO SUPPORT YOURSELF OF COURSE
6206-14958-0043 GET THROUGH THEIR COLLEGE AND GET MARRIED OR SOMETHING THEY WON'T WANT YOU THEN JULIA AROSE AND WENT TO THE WINDOW TO GET CALMED SHE WAS MORE ANGRY THAN SHE HAD BEEN FOR YEARS THE THOUGHT OF HERBERT'S HAVING TO TAKE CARE OF HER EVER WAS INTOLERABLE
6206-14958-0044 BUT SHE WAS ABLE TO HOLD HER TONGUE UNTIL SHE COULD GET HER EYES ON THOSE HILLS OUT OF THE WINDOW I WILL LIFT UP MINE EYES UNTO THE HILLS FROM WHENCE COMETH MY HELP THAT HAD BEEN THE VERSE WHICH SHE HAD READ FROM HER LITTLE BIBLE BEFORE LEAVING HER ROOM IN THE EARLY MORNING
6206-14958-0045 AND SHE WAS GRAPPLING IT CLOSE TO HER HEART FOR SHE HAD KNOWN IT WOULD BE A HARD DAY ELLEN WAS WATCHING HER SILENTLY ALMOST SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD MADE AN IMPRESSION PERHAPS THIS WAS THE TIME TO REPEAT HERBERT'S THREAT HERBERT FEELS SHE BEGAN
6206-14958-0046 WHERE LAY THE PAPER SHE AND MISTER LUDDINGTON HAD JUST SIGNED AND A COPY OF WHICH HE HAD TAKEN WITH HIM SHE RETURNED TO HER ASTONISHED SISTER WITH THE PAPER IN HER HAND PERHAPS IT WOULD BE JUST AS WELL FOR YOU TO READ THIS SHE SAID WITH DIGNITY
6206-14958-0047 THERE WAS SILENCE IN THE DINING ROOM WHILE ELLEN READ JULIA MOVING ON QUIET FEET ABOUT THE TABLE PUTTING THINGS TO RIGHTS SHE HAD FINISHED HER PART OF THE ARGUMENT SHE WAS RESOLUTELY PUTTING OUT OF HER MIND THE THINGS HER SISTER HAD JUST SAID AND REFUSING ALTOGETHER TO THINK OF HERBERT
6206-14958-0048 SHE KNEW IN HER HEART JUST HOW HERBERT HAD LOOKED WHEN HE HAD SAID THOSE THINGS EVEN TO THE SNARL AT THE CORNER OF HIS NOSE SHE KNEW TOO THAT ELLEN HAD PROBABLY NOT REPORTED THE MESSAGE EVEN SO DISAGREEABLY AS THE ORIGINAL AND SHE KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO FORGET
6206-14958-0049 THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING IS IN THE EATING AND YOU NEEDN'T TELL ME THAT ANY MAN IN HIS SENSES WILL PAY ALL THAT SALARY MERELY FOR A CHAPERON AS HE CALLS IT IF HE DOES HE'S A FOOL THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT TO SAY BUT I SUPPOSE NOTHING SHORT OF GETTING CAUGHT IN A TRAP WILL MAKE YOU SEE IT
6206-14958-0050 SO I BETTER SAVE MY BREATH I'M SURE I HOPE YOU WON'T GO TO THE POORHOUSE THROUGH YOUR STUBBORNNESS I'VE DONE ALL I COULD TO KEEP YOU FROM IT AND IT'S PRETTY HARD TO HAVE MY ONLY SISTER LEAVE ME SO SOO OO ON AFTER MOTHER'S DEATH
6206-14958-0051 WELL ELLEN SAID JULIA CLOUD LOOKING AT HER SPECULATIVELY I'M SURE I NEVER DREAMED YOU CARED ABOUT HAVING ME AWAY FROM HERE YOU'VE NEVER SHOWN MUCH INTEREST IN BEING WITH ME BUT I'M SORRY IF YOU FEEL IT THAT WAY
6206-14958-0052 AND I'M SURE I'LL WRITE TO YOU AND TRY TO DO LITTLE THINGS FOR THE CHILDREN OFTEN NOW THAT I SHALL HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH BUT HER KINDLY FEELING WAS CUT SHORT BY ELLEN INTERRUPTING HER
