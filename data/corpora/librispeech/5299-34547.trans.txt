5299-34547-0000 MISSUS SHATTUCK SEEMED TO BE THINKING AS HE PASSED HER HE STOPPED PICKED UP HER CUSHIONS AND RE ARRANGED THEM ABOUT HER WITH AN IDLE CARESS BY THE WAY A KISS GENTLY DROPPED ON THE INSIDE OF HER WHITE WRIST
5299-34547-0001 SHE FOLLOWED HIS EVERY MOVEMENT WITH A STRANGE SPECULATIVE LOOK IN HER EYES ALMOST AS IF HE WERE SOME NEW AND STRANGE ANIMAL THAT SHE WAS STUDYING FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN SHE SPOKE AGAIN IT WAS TO GO ON AS IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN INTERRUPTED
5299-34547-0002 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MAN COMES OUT OF A GREAT PASSION JUST AS GOOD AS NEW WHILE A WOMAN IS SHATTERED IN A MORAL SENSE AND NEVER FULLY RECOVERS HERSELF SHATTUCK'S BACK WAS TOWARD HER WHEN HE REPLIED
5299-34547-0003 SORRY TO SPOIL ANY MORE ILLUSIONS DEAR CHILD BUT HOW ABOUT THE LONG LIST OF MEN WHO ARE ANNUALLY RUINED BY IT THE MEN IN THE PRISONS THE MEN WHO KILL THEMSELVES THE MEN WHO HANG FOR IT THOSE ARE CRIMES I AM NOT TALKING OF THE CRIMINAL CLASSES
5299-34547-0004 BUT OF THE WORLD IN WHICH NORMAL PEOPLE LIVE OUR SET HE LAUGHED BUT THAT IS NOT THE WHOLE WORLD ALAS I KNOW THAT MEN WELL BRED CULTIVATED REFINED EVEN HONORABLE MEN SEEM TO BE ABLE TO REPEAT EVERY EMOTION OF LIFE
5299-34547-0005 A WOMAN SCALES THE HEIGHTS BUT ONCE HENCE IT MUST DEPEND IN THE CASE OF WOMEN CAPABLE OF DEEP LOVE ON THE MEN WHETHER THE RELATION INTO WHICH MARRIAGE BETRAYS THEM BE DECENT OR INDECENT WHAT I SHOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DISCOVER IS WHAT PROVISION DOES EITHER MAN
5299-34547-0006 OR CIVILIZATION PROPOSE TO MAKE FOR THE WOMAN WHOM FATE IN WANTON IRONY REDUCES EVEN IN MARRIAGE TO THE SELF CONSIDERED LEVEL OF THE GIRL IN THE STREET THERE WAS AMAZEMENT EVEN A FOREBODING ON SHATTUCK'S FACE AS HE PAUSED IN HIS WALK
5299-34547-0007 AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SPEAKING ANXIOUSLY EJACULATED I SWEAR I DON'T FOLLOW YOU SHE WENT ON AS IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN INTERRUPTED AS IF SHE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY WHICH HAD TO BE SAID AS IF SHE WERE REASONING IT OUT FOR HERSELF
5299-34547-0008 TAKE MY CASE I DON'T CLAIM THAT IT IS UNCOMMON I DO CLAIM THAT I WAS NOT THE WOMAN FOR THE SITUATION I WAS AN ONLY CHILD MY FATHER'S MARRIAGE HAD NOT BEEN HAPPY I WAS BROUGHT UP BY A DISAPPOINTED MAN ON PHILOSOPHY AND PESSIMISM
5299-34547-0009 OLD SCEPTICS AND MODERN SCOFFERS I REMEMBER IT WELL BEFORE I WAS OUT OF MY TEENS I HAD IMBIBED A MISTRUST FOR ALL EMOTIONS PERHAPS YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU MAY HAVE THOUGHT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ALL ON THE OUTSIDE THAT I HAD NONE
5299-34547-0010 MY POOR FATHER HAD HOPED WITH HIS TEACHINGS TO SAVE ME FROM FUTURE MISERY HE HAD PROBABLY THOUGHT TO SPARE ME THE COMMONPLACE SORROWS OF LOVE BUT HE COULD NOT THERE IS ONE THING MY CHILD THAT THE PASSING GENERATION CANNOT DO FOR ITS HEIRS LIVE FOR THEM LUCKILY
5299-34547-0011 WHY YOU MIGHT AS WELL FORBID A ROSE TO BLOSSOM BY WORD OF MOUTH AS TRY TO THWART NATURE IN A BEAUTIFUL HEALTHY WOMAN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TO BRING UP A WOMAN AS I WAS BROUGHT UP ONLY PREPARES HER TO TAKE THE DISTEMPER THE QUICKER
5299-34547-0012 I DO NOT REMEMBER THAT OF YOU BUT I DO KNOW THAT NO WOMAN WAS EVER WOOED AS HOTLY AS YOU WERE OR EVER I SWEAR IT MORE ARDENTLY DESIRED NO WOMAN EVER LED A MAN THE CHASE YOU LED ME IF EVER IN THOSE DAYS YOU WERE AS ANXIOUS FOR MY LOVE AS YOU HAVE SAID YOU WERE THIS EVENING
5299-34547-0013 NO ONE WOULD HAVE GUESSED IT LEAST OF ALL I MY REASON HAD ALREADY TAUGHT ME THAT MINE WAS BUT THE COMMON FATE OF ALL WOMEN THAT LIFE WAS DEMANDING OF ME THE USUAL TRIBUTE TO POSTERITY THAT THE SWEETNESS OF THE EMOTION WAS NATURE'S TRICK TO MAKE IT ENDURABLE
5299-34547-0014 BUT ACCORDING TO NATURE'S ETERNAL PLAN MY HEART COULD NOT LISTEN TO MY HEAD IT BEAT SO LOUD WHEN YOU WERE BY IT COULD NOT HEAR PERHAPS BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING OF MY FATHER'S PHILOSOPHY LEFT IN ME
5299-34547-0015 EVEN WHEN I BELIEVED IN YOU BECAUSE I WANTED TO AND HALF HOPED THAT ALL MY TEACHING WAS WRONG I MADE A BARGAIN WITH MYSELF I TOLD MYSELF QUITE CALMLY THAT I KNEW PERFECTLY WELL ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE FUTURE
5299-34547-0016 THAT IF I WENT FORWARD WITH YOU I WENT FORWARD DELIBERATELY WITH OPEN EYES KNOWING WHAT LOGICALLY I MIGHT EXPECT TO FIND IN THE FUTURE IGNORANCE THAT BLISSFUL COMFORT OF SO MANY WOMEN WAS DENIED ME STILL
5299-34547-0017 THE SPELL OF NATURE WAS UPON ME AND FOR A TIME I DREAMED THAT A DEPTH OF PASSIONATE LOVE LIKE MINE A LIFE OF LOYAL DEVOTION MIGHT WRAP ONE MAN ROUND AND KEEP HIM SAFE MIGHT IN FACT WORK A MIRACLE
5299-34547-0018 AND MAKE ONE POLYGAMOUS MAN MONOGAMOUS BUT EVEN WHILE THAT HOPE WAS IN MY HEART REASON ROSE UP AND MOCKED IT BIDDING ME ADVANCE INTO THE FUTURE AT MY PERIL I DID IT BUT I MADE A BARGAIN WITH MYSELF
5299-34547-0019 I AGREED TO ABIDE THE CONSEQUENCES AND TO ABIDE THEM CALMLY AND DURING ALL THOSE DAYS WHEN I SUPPOSED WE WERE SO NEAR TOGETHER YOU SHOWED ME NOTHING OF THIS THAT WAS IN YOUR HEART
5299-34547-0020 MEN AND WOMEN KNOW VERY RARELY ANYTHING OF THE GREAT STRUGGLES THAT GO ON IN THE HEARTS OF ONE ANOTHER BESIDES I KNEW HOW EASILY YOU WOULD REPLY NATURALLY WE ARE ALL ON THE DEFENSIVE IN THIS LIFE IT WAS WITH THINGS DEEPER THAN WORDS THAT I WAS DEALING
5299-34547-0021 THE THINGS ONE DOES NOT SAYS EVEN IN THE EARLY DAYS OF OUR ENGAGEMENT I KNEW THAT I WAS NOT AS ESSENTIAL TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME LIFE HELD OTHER INTERESTS FOR YOU EVEN THE FLATTERY OF OTHER WOMEN STILL HAD ITS CHARM FOR YOU
5299-34547-0022 YOUNG AS I WAS I SAID TO MYSELF IF YOU MARRY THIS MAN WITH YOUR EYES OPEN BLAME YOURSELF NOT HIM IF YOU SUFFER I DO BELIEVE THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT
5299-34547-0023 SHATTUCK WAS ASTRIDE HIS CHAIR AGAIN HIS ELBOWS ON THE BACK HIS CHIN IN HIS HANDS HE NO LONGER RESPONDED WORDS WERE DANGEROUS HIS LIPS WERE PRESSED CLOSE TOGETHER AND THERE WAS A LONG DEEP LINE BETWEEN HIS EYES
5299-34547-0024 BUT I SEEMED TO LACK SOME OF THE QUALITIES THAT AID TO RECONCILE OTHER WIVES TO LIFE I SEEMED TO BE WITHOUT MOTHER LOVE MY CHILDREN WERE DEAR TO ME ONLY BECAUSE THEY WERE YOURS THE MATERNAL PASSION WHICH IN SO MANY WOMEN IS THE ABSORBING EMOTION OF LIFE WAS DENIED ME
5299-34547-0025 AS THE PENALTY OF YOUR LOVE NOTHING MORE I MUST BE SINGULARLY UNFITTED FOR MARRIAGE BECAUSE WHEN THE HOUR CAME IN WHICH I FELT THAT I WAS NO LONGER YOUR WIFE YOUR CHILDREN SEEMED NO LONGER MINE THEY MERELY REPRESENTED THE NEXT GENERATION BORN OF ME
5299-34547-0026 I KNOW THAT THIS IS VERY SHOCKING I HAVE BECOME USED TO IT AND IT IS THE TRUTH I HAVE NOT BLAMED YOU I COULD NOT AND BE REASONABLE NO MAN CAN BE OTHER THAN NATURE PLANS OR PERMITS BUT HOW I HAVE PITIED MYSELF
5299-34547-0027 I HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE TEMPEST ALONE IN SPITE OF REASON IN SPITE OF PHILOSOPHY I HAVE SUFFERED FROM JEALOUSY FROM SHAME FROM RAGE FROM SELF CONTEMPT BUT THAT IS ALL PAST NOW
5299-34547-0028 SHE HAD NOT RAISED HER VOICE WHICH SEEMED AS WITHOUT FEELING AS IT WAS WITHOUT EMPHASIS SHE CAREFULLY EXAMINED HER HANDKERCHIEF CORNER BY CORNER AND HE NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME HOW THIN HER HANDS HAD BECOME NATURALLY SHE WENT ON IN THAT COLORLESS VOICE
5299-34547-0029 MY FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO BE DONE WITH LIFE BUT I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO THAT MUCH AS I DESIRED IT IT WOULD HAVE LEFT YOU SUCH A WRETCHED MEMORY OF ME YOU COULD NEVER HAVE PARDONED ME THE SCANDAL AND I FELT THAT I HAD AT LEAST THE RIGHT TO LEAVE YOU A DECENT RECOLLECTION OF ME
5299-34547-0030 SHATTUCK'S HEAD FELL FORWARD ON HIS ARMS THE IDEA OF DENIAL OR PROTEST DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM THE STEADY VOICE WENT MONOTONOUSLY ON I COULD NOT BEAR TO HUMBLE YOU IN THE EYES OF OTHERS EVEN BY FORCING YOU TO FACE A SCANDAL
5299-34547-0031 I COULD NOT BEAR TO HUMBLE YOU IN YOUR OWN EYES BY LETTING YOU SUSPECT THAT I KNEW THE TRUTH I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO DISTURB THE OUTWARD RESPECTABILITY OF YOUR LIFE BY INTERRUPTING ITS OUTWARD CALM TO BE ABSOLUTELY HONEST THOUGH I HAD LOST YOU I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO GIVE YOU UP
5299-34547-0032 AS I FELT I MUST IF I LET ANY ONE DISCOVER MOST OF ALL YOU WHAT I KNEW SO LIKE A COWARD I LIVED ON BECOMING GRADUALLY ACCUSTOMED TO THE IDEA THAT MY DAY WAS PAST BUT KNOWING THAT THE MOMENT I WAS FORCED TO SPEAK
5299-34547-0033 SINGULARLY ENOUGH AS I GREW CALM I GREW TO RESPECT THIS OTHER WOMAN I COULD NOT BLAME HER FOR LOVING YOU I ENDED BY ADMIRING HER I HAD KNOWN HER SO WELL SHE WAS SUCH A PROUD WOMAN
5299-34547-0034 I LOOKED BACK AT MY MARRIAGE AND SAW THE AFFAIR AS IT REALLY WAS I HAD NOT SOLD MYSELF TO YOU EXACTLY I HAD LOVED YOU TOO MUCH TO BARGAIN IN THAT WAY NEVERTHELESS THE MARRIAGE HAD BEEN A BARGAIN IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR PROMISE TO PROTECT AND PROVIDE FOR ME TO FEED ME CLOTHE ME
5299-34547-0035 SHARE YOUR FORTUNE WITH ME AND GIVE ME YOUR NAME I HAD GIVEN YOU MYSELF
5299-34547-0036 GIVES THAT SAME PERMISSION TO ALMOST ANY ONE WHO ASKS FOR IT NAOMI HE GROANED FROM HIS COVERED MOUTH WHAT GHASTLY PHILOSOPHY ISN'T THAT THE MARRIAGE LAW HOW MUCH BETTER AM I AFTER ALL THAN THE POOR GIRL IN THE STREET
5299-34547-0037 WHO IS FORCED TO IT BY MISERY TO BE SURE I BELIEVE THERE IS SOME FARCICAL PHRASE IN THE BARGAIN ABOUT PROMISING TO LOVE NONE OTHER
5299-34547-0038 AT WHICH NATURE LAUGHS YET THIS OTHER WOMAN PROUD HIGH MINDED UNSELFISH HITHERTO ABOVE REPROACH HAD GIVEN HERSELF FOR LOVE ALONE WITH EVERYTHING TO LOSE AND NOTHING TO GAIN I HAVE COME TO DOUBT MYSELF
5299-34547-0039 I HAVE HAD MY DAY FOR YEARS IT WAS AN ENVIABLE ONE NO WOMAN CAN HOPE FOR MORE WHAT RIGHT HAVE I TO STAND IN THE WAY OF ANOTHER WOMAN'S HAPPINESS A HAPPINESS NO ONE CAN VALUE BETTER THAN I WHO SO LONG WORE IT IN SECURITY
5299-34547-0040 I BORE MY CHILDREN IN PEACE WITH THE DIVINE CONSOLATION OF YOUR DEVOTION ABOUT ME WHAT RIGHT HAVE I TO DENY ANOTHER WOMAN THE SAME JOY SHATTUCK SPRANG TO HIS FEET IT'S NOT TRUE HE GASPED IT'S NOT TRUE
5299-34547-0041 SHE WENT ON CAREFULLY INSPECTING THE FILMY BIT OF LACE IN HER HANDS IT IS TRUE SHE REPLIED NEVER MIND HOW I DISCOVERED IT I KNOW IT THAT IS WHY SHE HAS GONE ABROAD ALONE
5299-34547-0042 BUT NOT ENOUGH OF ONE TO BEAR THE THOUGHT OF HER ALONE IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY WITH MIND AND EMOTIONS CLOUDED I MAY BE COWARDLY ENOUGH TO WISH THAT I HAD NEVER FOUND IT OUT I AM NOT COWARD ENOUGH TO KEEP SILENT ANY LONGER
5299-34547-0043 A TORRENT OF WORDS RUSHED TO THE MAN'S LIPS BUT HE WAS TOO WISE TO MAKE EXCUSES YET THERE WERE EXCUSES ANY FAIR MINDED JUDGE WOULD HAVE SAID SO BUT HE KNEW BETTER THAN TO THINK THAT FOR ONE MOMENT THEY WOULD BE EXCUSES IN THE MIND OF THIS WOMAN
5299-34547-0044 BESIDES THE FIRST MAN'S EXCUSE FOR THE FIRST SIN HAS NEVER BEEN VIEWED WITH MUCH RESPECT UNDER THE MODERN CIVILIZATION HE FELT HER SLOWLY RISE TO HER FEET AND WHEN HE RAISED HIS HEAD TO LOOK AT HER NOT YET FULLY REALIZING WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM
5299-34547-0045 THAT HE FELT AS IF SHE WERE ALREADY A STRANGER TO HIM SHE TOOK A LAST LOOK ROUND THE ROOM HER EYES SEEMED TO DEVOUR EVERY DETAIL I SHALL FIND MEANS TO GIVE YOU YOUR FREEDOM AT ONCE YOU WILL ACTUALLY LEAVE ME
5299-34547-0046 GO AWAY CAN WE TWO REMAIN TOGETHER NOW BUT YOUR CHILDREN YOUR CHILDREN DICK I HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT I HAVE ANY I HAVE HAD MY LIFE YOU HAVE STILL YOURS TO LIVE
5299-34547-0047 SHE SWEPT BY HIM DOWN THE LONG ROOM EVERYTHING IN WHICH WAS SO CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH HER BEFORE SHE REACHED THE DOOR HE WAS THERE AND HIS BACK AGAINST IT SHE STOPPED BUT SHE DID NOT LOOK AT HIM
5299-34547-0048 ALL THAT SHE HAD BEEN IN HER LOYALTY HER NOBILITY WAS SO MUCH A PART OF THIS MAN'S LIFE WHAT COMPARED TO THAT WERE PETTY SINS OR BIG ONES HE SAW THE PAST AS A DROWNING MAN SEES THE PANORAMA OF HIS EXISTENCE
5299-34547-0049 YET HE KNEW THAT EVERYTHING HE COULD SAY WOULD BE POWERLESS TO MOVE HER IT WAS USELESS TO REMIND HER OF THEIR HAPPY YEARS TOGETHER THEY COULD NEVER BE HAPPY AGAIN WITH THIS BETWEEN THEM IT WOULD BE EQUALLY USELESS TO TELL HER THAT THIS OTHER WOMAN HAD KNOWN BUT TOO WELL
5299-34547-0050 THAT HE WOULD NEVER DESERT HIS WIFE FOR HER HAD HE NOT BETRAYED HER OF WHAT USE TO TELL HER HOW HE HAD REPENTED HIS FOLLY THAT HE COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND IT HIMSELF THERE WERE THE FACTS AND NATURE AND HIS WIFE'S PHILOSOPHY AGAINST HIM
5299-34547-0051 AND HE HAD DARED BE GAY THE MOMENT THE STEAMER SLID INTO THE CHANNEL WAS THAT ONLY THIS MORNING IT SEEMED TO BE IN THE LAST CENTURY SHE APPROACHED AND STRETCHED HER HAND TOWARD THE DOOR HE DID NOT MOVE
5299-34547-0052 DON'T STOP ME SHE PLEADED DON'T MAKE IT ANY HARDER THAN IT IS LET ME TAKE WITH ME THE CONSOLATION OF A DECENT LIFE TOGETHER A DECENT LIFE DECENTLY SEVERED
5299-34547-0053 SHE SHRANK BACK WITH A SHUDDER CRYING OUT THAT HE SHOULD SPARE HER HER OWN CONTEMPT THAT HE SHOULD LEAVE HER THE POWER TO SEEK PEACE AND HER VOICE HAD SUCH A TONE OF TERROR AS SHE RECOILED FROM HIM THAT HE FELT HOW POWERLESS ANY PROTEST WOULD BE
5299-34547-0054 HE STEPPED ASIDE WITHOUT LOOKING AT HIM SHE QUICKLY OPENED THE DOOR AND PASSED OUT
5299-34547-0055 NO ONE DARED MEN CAN'T ROUGH HOUSE THAT KIND OF A WOMAN AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE THE CRITIC SPOKE UP YOU WERE RIGHT TO READ THAT STORY IT IS NOT THE SORT OF THING THAT LENDS ITSELF TO NARRATING
5299-34547-0056 OF COURSE YOU MIGHT HAVE ACTED IT OUT BUT YOU WERE WISE NOT TO I CAN'T HELP IT GOT TO SAY IT SAID THE JOURNALIST WHAT A HORRID WOMAN THE DIVORCEE LOOKED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT
5299-34547-0057 I THOUGHT I HAD MADE HER SO REASONABLE JUST WHAT ALL WOMEN OUGHT TO BE AND WHAT NONE OF US ARE
5299-34547-0058 I'D AS LIEF LIVE IN A WORLD CREATED AND RUN BY GEORGE BERNARD SHAW
5299-34547-0059 COME COME INTERRUPTED THE DOCTOR WHO HAD BEEN EYEING HER PROFILE WITH A CURIOUS HALF AMUSED EXPRESSION ALL THROUGH THE READING DON'T LET US GET ON THAT SUBJECT TO NIGHT A STORY IS A STORY YOU HAVE ASKED AND YOU HAVE RECEIVED
5299-34547-0060 NONE OF YOU SEEM TO REALLY LIKE ANY STORY BUT YOUR OWN AND I MUST CONFESS THAT AMONG US WE ARE PUTTING FORTH A STRANGE BAGGAGE ON THE CONTRARY SAID THE CRITIC
5299-34547-0061 I DENY IT SAID THE CRITIC MINE HAD REAL LITERARY QUALITY AND A VERY DRAMATIC CLIMAX OH WELL IF DEATH IS DRAMATIC PERHAPS YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE UP TO DATE WHO HAS KILLED HIS HEROINE
5299-34547-0062 NO STORY IS FINISHED UNTIL THE HEROINE IS DEAD SAID THE JOURNALIST
5299-34547-0063 DID SHE ASKED THE CRITIC OF THE DIVORCEE WHO WAS STILL NERVOUSLY ROLLING HER MANUSCRIPT IN BOTH HANDS I DON'T KNOW HOW SHOULD I AND IF I DID I SHOULDN'T TELL YOU IT ISN'T A TRUE STORY OF COURSE
5299-34547-0064 AND SHE ROSE FROM HER CHAIR AND WALKED AWAY INTO THE MOONLIGHT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY EJACULATED THE VIOLINIST WHO ADMIRED HER TREMENDOUSLY THAT SHE MADE THAT UP IN THE IMAGINATION SHE CARRIES AROUND UNDER THAT PRETTY FLUFFY HAIR
5299-34547-0065 I'D RATHER THAT IT WERE TRUE THAT SHE HAD PICKED IT UP SOMEWHERE AS WE BEGAN TO PREPARE TO GO IN THE DOCTOR LOOKED DOWN THE PATH TO WHERE THE DIVORCEE WAS STILL STANDING
5299-34547-0066 HE TOOK HER LACE SCARF FROM THE BACK OF HER CHAIR AND STROLLED AFTER HER THE SCULPTOR SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WITH SUCH A DROLL EXPRESSION THAT WE ALL HAD TO SMILE THEN WE WENT INDOORS WELL SAID THE DOCTOR AS HE JOINED HER
5299-34547-0067 SHE TOLD ME ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS WAS THAT THE WAY IT HAPPENED NO NO REPLIED THE DIVORCEE PETULANTLY THAT IS NOT A BIT THE WAY IT HAPPENED THAT IS THE WAY I WISH IT HAD HAPPENED
5299-34547-0068 OH NO I WAS BROUGHT UP TO BELIEVE IN THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN MARRIAGE AND I DID WHAT I THOUGHT BECAME A WOMANLY WOMAN I ASSERTED MY RIGHTS AND MADE A COMMON OR GARDEN ROW THE DOCTOR LAUGHED AS SHE STAMPED HER FOOT AT HIM
5299-34547-0069 SHE SAID PETTISHLY IT SERVES ME QUITE RIGHT NOW I SUPPOSE THEY'VE GOT ALL SORTS OF QUEER NOTIONS IN THEIR HEADS NONSENSE SAID THE DOCTOR ALL AUTHORS YOU KNOW RUN THE RISK OF GETTING MIXED UP IN THEIR ROMANCES THINK OF CHARLOTTE BRONTE
5299-34547-0070 I'M NOT AN AUTHOR AND I AM GOING TO BED
5299-34547-0071 AND SHE SAILED INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING THE DOCTOR GAZING QUIZZICALLY AFTER HER BEFORE SHE WAS OUT OF HEARING HE CALLED TO HER I SAY YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT SINCE NINETY TWO
