7229-80656-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN SPRING IN THE BIG WOODS THAT VISIT TO THE LUMBER CAMP WAS MEMORABLE FOR NAN SHERWOOD IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE HER ADVENTURE WITH THE LYNX SHE KEPT SECRET FROM HER RELATIVES
7229-80656-0001 BECAUSE OF THE REASON GIVEN IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER INCIDENT THAT MARKED THE OCCASION TO THE GIRL'S MIND AND THAT WAS THE THREAT OF GEDNEY RAFFER REPORTED TO HER UNCLE HENRY
7229-80656-0002 NAN THOUGHT THAT SUCH A BAD MAN AS RAFFER APPEARED TO BE WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY CARRY OUT HIS THREAT HE HAD OFFERED MONEY TO HAVE MISTER SHERWOOD BEATEN UP AND THE RUFFIANS HE HAD BRIBED WOULD DOUBTLESS BE ONLY TOO EAGER TO EARN THE REWARD
7229-80656-0003 TO TELL THE TRUTH FOR WEEKS THEREAFTER NAN NEVER SAW A ROUGH LOOKING MAN APPROACH THE HOUSE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF PINE CAMP WITHOUT FEARING THAT HERE WAS COMING A RUFFIAN BENT ON HER UNCLE'S INJURY
7229-80656-0004 ONLY MADE NAN MORE KEENLY ALIVE TO HIS DANGER SHE DARED NOT DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH AUNT KATE FOR NAN FEARED TO WORRY THAT GOOD WOMAN UNNECESSARILY
7229-80656-0005 BESIDES HAVING BEEN USED TO HIDING FROM HER OWN MOTHER ALL UNPLEASANT THINGS THE GIRL NATURALLY DISPLAYED THE SAME THOUGHTFULNESS FOR AUNT KATE FOR
7229-80656-0006 DESPITE MISSUS HENRY SHERWOOD'S BRUSKNESS AND MASCULINE APPEARANCE NAN LEARNED THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN MATTERS OVER WHICH HER AUNT SHOWED EXTREME NERVOUSNESS FOR INSTANCE
7229-80656-0007 SHE WAS VERY CAREFUL OF THE LAMPS USED IN THE HOUSE SHE INSISTED UPON CLEANING AND CARING FOR THEM HERSELF SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW A CANDLE TO BE USED BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE OVERTURNED AND SHE SAW TO IT HERSELF THAT EVERY FIRE
7229-80656-0008 EVEN THE ONE IN NAN'S BEDROOM WAS PROPERLY BANKED BEFORE THE FAMILY RETIRED AT NIGHT NAN HAD ALWAYS IN MIND WHAT UNCLE HENRY SAID ABOUT MENTIONING FIRE TO AUNT KATE
7229-80656-0009 SO THE CURIOUS YOUNG GIRL KEPT HER LIPS CLOSED UPON THE SUBJECT BUT SHE CERTAINLY WAS DESIROUS OF KNOWING ABOUT THAT FIRE SO LONG AGO AT PALE LICK HOW IT CAME ABOUT
7229-80656-0010 IF AUNT KATE HAD REALLY GOT HER GREAT SCAR THERE AND IF IT WAS REALLY TRUE THAT TWO MEMBERS OF HER UNCLE'S FAMILY HAD MET THEIR DEATH IN THE CONFLAGRATION SHE TRIED NOT TO THINK AT ALL OF INJUN PETE
7229-80656-0011 THAT WAS TOO TERRIBLE WITH ALL HER HEART NAN WISHED SHE MIGHT DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD REALLY HELP UNCLE HENRY SOLVE HIS PROBLEM REGARDING THE TIMBER RIGHTS ON THE PERKINS TRACT
7229-80656-0012 THE VERY JUDGE WHO HAD GRANTED THE INJUNCTION FORBIDDING MISTER SHERWOOD TO CUT TIMBER ON THE TRACT WAS RELATED TO THE PRESENT OWNERS OF THE PIECE OF TIMBERLAND
7229-80656-0013 AND THE TRACT HAD BEEN THE BASIS OF A FEUD IN THE PERKINS FAMILY FOR TWO GENERATIONS MANY PEOPLE WERE MORE OR LESS INTERESTED IN THE CASE AND THEY CAME TO THE SHERWOOD HOME AND TALKED EXCITEDLY ABOUT IT IN THE BIG KITCHEN
7229-80656-0014 SOME ADVISED AN UTTER DISREGARD OF THE LAW OTHERS WERE EVIDENTLY MINDED TO INCREASE THE TROUBLE BETWEEN RAFFER AND UNCLE HENRY BY MALICIOUS TALE BEARING OFTEN NAN THOUGHT OF WHAT UNCLE HENRY HAD SAID TO OLD
7229-80656-0015 TOBY VANDERWILLER SHE LEARNED THAT TOBY WAS ONE OF THE OLDEST SETTLERS IN THIS PART OF THE MICHIGAN PENINSULA AND IN HIS YOUTH HAD BEEN A TIMBER RUNNER THAT IS A MAN WHO BY FOLLOWING THE SURVEYORS LINES ON A PIECE OF TIMBER
7229-80656-0016 AND WEAVING BACK AND FORTH ACROSS IT CAN JUDGE ITS MARKET VALUE SO NEARLY RIGHT THAT HIS EMPLOYER THE PROSPECTIVE TIMBER MERCHANT IS ABLE TO BID INTELLIGENTLY FOR THE SO CALLED STUMPAGE ON THE TRACT
7229-80656-0017 TOBY WAS STILL A VIGOROUS MAN SAVE WHEN THAT BANE OF THE WOODSMAN RHEUMATISM LAID HIM BY THE HEELS HE HAD A BIT OF A FARM IN THE TAMARACK SWAMP ONCE BEING LAID UP BY HIS ARCH ENEMY
7229-80656-0018 WITH HIS JOINTS STIFFENED AND MUSCLES THROBBING WITH PAIN TOBY HAD SEEN THE GAUNT WOLF OF STARVATION MORE TERRIBLE THAN ANY TIMBER WOLF WAITING AT HIS DOORSTONE
7229-80656-0019 HIS OLD WIFE AND A CRIPPLED GRANDSON WERE DEPENDENT ON TOBY TOO THUS IN DESPERATE STRAITS TOBY VANDERWILLER HAD ACCEPTED HELP FROM GEDNEY RAFFER
7229-80656-0020 IT WAS A PITIFULLY SMALL SUM RAFFER WOULD ADVANCE UPON THE LITTLE FARM BUT IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO PUT TOBY IN THE USURER'S POWER THIS WAS THE STORY NAN LEARNED REGARDING TOBY
7229-80656-0021 AND UNCLE HENRY BELIEVED THAT TOBY WITH HIS OLD TIME KNOWLEDGE OF LAND BOUNDARIES COULD TELL IF HE WOULD WHICH WAS RIGHT IN THE PRESENT CONTENTION BETWEEN MISTER SHERWOOD AND GEDNEY RAFFER
7229-80656-0022 THESE AND MANY OTHER SUBJECTS OF THOUGHT KEPT THE MIND OF NAN SHERWOOD OCCUPIED DURING THE FIRST FEW WEEKS OF HER SOJOURN AT PINE CAMP SHE HAD TOO TO KEEP UP HER DIARY
7229-80656-0023 THAT SHE HAD BEGUN FOR BESS HARLEY'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT EVERY WEEK SHE SENT OFF TO TILLBURY A BULKY SECTION OF THIS REPORT OF HER LIFE IN THE BIG WOODS IT WAS QUITE WONDERFUL HOW MUCH THERE PROVED TO BE TO WRITE ABOUT
7229-80656-0024 BESS WROTE BACK ENVIOUSLY THAT NEVER DID ANYTHING INTERESTING BY ANY POSSIBILITY HAPPEN NOW THAT NAN WAS AWAY FROM TILLBURY THE TOWN WAS AS DULL AS DITCH WATER
7229-80656-0025 SHE BESS LIVED ONLY IN HOPES OF MEETING HER CHUM AT LAKEVIEW HALL THE NEXT SEPTEMBER THIS HOPE NAN SHARED BUT IT ALL LAY WITH THE RESULT
7229-80656-0026 OF MOMSEY'S AND PAPA SHERWOOD'S VISIT TO SCOTLAND AND EMBERON CASTLE AND NAN THOUGHT IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HER PARENTS NEVER WOULD EVEN REACH THAT FAR DISTANT GOAL
7229-80656-0027 THEY HAD TAKEN A SLOW SHIP FOR MOMSEY'S BENEFIT AND THE EXPECTED RE TELEGRAPHED CABLEGRAM WAS LOOKED FOR AT THE FORKS FOR A WEEK BEFORE IT POSSIBLY COULD COME
7229-80656-0028 IT WAS A GALA DAY MARKED ON NAN'S CALENDAR WHEN UNCLE HENRY COMING HOME FROM THE RAILROAD STATION BEHIND THE ROAN PONIES CALLED TO HER TO COME OUT AND GET THE MESSAGE
7229-80656-0029 MOMSEY AND PAPA SHERWOOD HAD SENT IT FROM GLASGOW AND WERE ON THEIR WAY TO EDINBURGH BEFORE NAN RECEIVED THE WORD MOMSEY HAD BEEN VERY ILL A PART OF THE WAY ACROSS THE OCEAN BUT WENT ASHORE IN IMPROVED HEALTH
7229-80656-0030 NAN WAS INDEED HAPPY AT THIS JUNCTURE HER PARENTS WERE SAFELY OVER THEIR VOYAGE ON THE WINTRY OCEAN SO A PART OF HER WORRY OF MIND WAS LIFTED MEANWHILE
7229-80656-0031 SPRING WAS STEALING UPON PINE CAMP WITHOUT NAN'S BEING REALLY AWARE OF THE FACT UNCLE HENRY HAD SAID BACK IN CHICAGO THAT THE BACK OF WINTER WAS BROKEN BUT THE EXTREME COLD WEATHER
7229-80656-0032 AND THE DEEP SNOW SHE HAD FOUND IN THE BIG WOODS MADE NAN FORGET THAT MARCH WAS PASSING AND TIMID APRIL WAS TREADING ON HIS HEELS A RAIN LASTING TWO DAYS AND A NIGHT WASHED THE ROADS OF SNOW
7229-80656-0033 AND TURNED THE FAST DISAPPEARING DRIFTS TO A DIRTY YELLOW HUE IN SHELTERED FENCE CORNERS AND NOOKS IN THE WOOD THE GRASS LIFTED NEW GREEN BLADES
7229-80656-0034 UNDER LAST YEAR'S DRIFTED LEAVES THE RIVER ICE WENT OUT WITH A RUSH AFTER IT HAD RAINED A FEW HOURS AFTER THAT THE DRIVES OF LOGS WERE SOON STARTED
7229-80656-0035 NAN WENT DOWN TO THE LONG HIGH BRIDGE WHICH SPANNED THE RIVER AND WATCHED THE FLOOD CARRY THE LOGS THROUGH AT FIRST THEY CAME SCATTERINGLY RIDING THE FOAMING WAVES END ON
7229-80656-0036 AND SOMETIMES COLLIDING WITH THE STONE PIERS OF THE BRIDGE WITH SUFFICIENT FORCE TO SPLIT THE UNHEWN TIMBERS FROM END TO END SOME BEING LAID OPEN AS NEATLY AS THOUGH DONE WITH AXE AND WEDGE
7229-80656-0037 WHEN THE MAIN BODY OF THE DRIVE ARRIVED HOWEVER THE LOGS WERE LIKE HERDED CATTLE MILLING IN THE EDDIES STAMPEDED BY A CROSS CURRENT BUNCHING UNDER THE BRIDGE ARCHES LIKE FRIGHTENED STEERS IN A CHUTE
7229-80656-0038 AND THE DRIVERS HERDED THE LOGS WITH ALL THE SKILL OF COWBOYS ON THE RANGE EACH DRIVE WAS ATTENDED BY ITS OWN CREW WHO GUARDED THE LOGS ON EITHER BANK
7229-80656-0039 LAUNCHING THOSE THAT SHOALED ON THE NUMEROUS SANDBARS OR IN THE SHALLOWS KEEPING THEM FROM PILING UP IN COVES AND IN THE MOUTHS OF ESTUARIES OR CREEKS
7229-80656-0040 SOME GOING AHEAD AT THE BENDS TO FEND OFF AND BREAK UP ANY FORMATION OF THE DRIFTING TIMBERS THAT PROMISED TO BECOME A JAM BEHIND THE DRIVE FLOATED THE SQUARE
7229-80656-0041 WHICH CARRIED COOK AND PROVISIONS FOR THE MEN A BOOM LOGS CHAINED TOGETHER END TO END WAS THROWN OUT FROM ONE SHORE OF THE WIDE STREAM AT NIGHT AND ANCHORED AT ITS OUTER END BEHIND THIS
7229-80656-0042 THE LOGS WERE GATHERED IN AN ORDERLY COMPACT MASS AND THE MEN COULD GENERALLY GET THEIR SLEEP SAVE FOR THE WATCHMAN UNLESS THERE CAME A SUDDEN RISE OF WATER IN THE NIGHT IT WAS A SIGHT LONG TO BE REMEMBERED NAN THOUGHT
7229-80656-0043 WHEN THE BOOM WAS BROKEN IN THE MORNING SOMETIMES AN INCREASING CURRENT PILED THE LOGS UP A GOOD BIT IT WAS A FEAR COMPELLING VIEW THE GIRL HAD OF THE RIVER ON ONE DAY
7229-80656-0044 WHEN SHE WENT WITH UNCLE HENRY TO SEE THE FIRST DRIVE FROM BLACKTON'S CAMP TOM WAS COMING HOME WITH HIS TEAM AND WAS NOT ENGAGED IN THE DRIVE BUT RECKLESS RAFE WAS CONSIDERED FOR HIS AGE A VERY SMART HAND ON A LOG DRIVE
7229-80656-0045 THE RIVER HAD RISEN TWO FEET AT THE PINE CAMP BRIDGE OVERNIGHT IT WAS A BOILING BROWN FLOOD COVERED WITH DRIFTING FOAM AND DEBRIS
7229-80656-0046 THE ROAR OF THE FRESHET AWOKE NAN IN HER BED BEFORE DAYBREAK SO SHE WAS NOT SURPRISED TO SEE THE RIVER IN SUCH A TURMOIL WHEN AFTER A HASTY BREAKFAST SHE AND UNCLE HENRY WALKED BESIDE THE FLOOD
7229-80656-0047 THEY STARTED THEIR DRIVE LAST NIGHT UNCLE HENRY SAID AND BOOMED HER JUST BELOW THE CAMPSITE WE'LL GO UP TO DEAD MAN'S BEND AND WATCH HER COME DOWN
7229-80656-0048 ASKED NAN WHAT HONEY HE RESPONDED THAT BEND IN THE RIVER WHY
7229-80656-0049 SHE'S JUST CALLED THAT MANY A MAN'S LOST HIS LIFE THERE SINCE I CAME INTO THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY THAT'S A FACT IT'S A DANGEROUS PLACE
