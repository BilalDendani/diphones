1813-142304-0000 THE SADDEST BIRDS A SEASON FIND TO SING SOUTHWELL
1813-142304-0001 NEVER WEIGHED DOWN BY MEMORY'S CLOUDS AGAIN TO BOW THY HEAD THOU ART GONE HOME MISSUS HEMANS MISSUS THORNTON CAME TO SEE MISSUS HALE THE NEXT MORNING SHE WAS MUCH WORSE ONE OF THOSE SUDDEN CHANGES
1813-142304-0002 THOSE GREAT VISIBLE STRIDES TOWARDS DEATH HAD BEEN TAKEN IN THE NIGHT AND HER OWN FAMILY WERE STARTLED BY THE GRAY SUNKEN LOOK HER FEATURES HAD ASSUMED IN THAT ONE TWELVE HOURS OF SUFFERING MISSUS THORNTON WHO HAD NOT SEEN HER FOR WEEKS WAS SOFTENED ALL AT ONCE
1813-142304-0003 SHE HAD COME BECAUSE HER SON ASKED IT FROM HER AS A PERSONAL FAVOUR BUT WITH ALL THE PROUD BITTER FEELINGS OF HER NATURE IN ARMS AGAINST THAT FAMILY OF WHICH MARGARET FORMED ONE SHE DOUBTED THE REALITY OF MISSUS HALE'S ILLNESS
1813-142304-0004 SHE DOUBTED ANY WANT BEYOND A MOMENTARY FANCY ON THAT LADY'S PART WHICH SHOULD TAKE HER OUT OF HER PREVIOUSLY SETTLED COURSE OF EMPLOYMENT FOR THE DAY
1813-142304-0005 THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO SUCH USELESS LANGUAGES AS LATIN AND GREEK EVER INVENTED HE BORE ALL THIS PRETTY SILENTLY BUT WHEN SHE HAD ENDED HER INVECTIVE AGAINST THE DEAD LANGUAGES HE QUIETLY RETURNED TO THE SHORT CURT DECIDED EXPRESSION OF HIS WISH
1813-142304-0006 THAT SHE SHOULD GO AND SEE MISSUS HALE AT THE TIME APPOINTED AS MOST LIKELY TO BE CONVENIENT TO THE INVALID
1813-142304-0007 ALL THE TIME LIKING HIM THE BETTER FOR HAVING IT AND EXAGGERATING IN HER OWN MIND THE SAME NOTION THAT HE HAD OF EXTRAORDINARY GOODNESS ON HIS PART IN SO PERSEVERINGLY KEEPING UP WITH THE HALES HIS GOODNESS VERGING ON WEAKNESS AS ALL THE SOFTER VIRTUES DID IN HER MIND
1813-142304-0008 WERE THE IDEAS WHICH OCCUPIED MISSUS THORNTON TILL SHE WAS STRUCK INTO NOTHINGNESS BEFORE THE DARK SHADOW OF THE WINGS OF THE ANGEL OF DEATH THERE LAY MISSUS HALE A MOTHER LIKE HERSELF
1813-142304-0009 A MUCH YOUNGER WOMAN THAN SHE WAS ON THE BED FROM WHICH THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HOPE THAT SHE MIGHT EVER RISE AGAIN NO MORE VARIETY OF LIGHT AND SHADE FOR HER IN THAT DARKENED ROOM NO POWER OF ACTION SCARCELY CHANGE OF MOVEMENT
1813-142304-0010 FAINT ALTERNATIONS OF WHISPERED SOUND AND STUDIOUS SILENCE AND YET THAT MONOTONOUS LIFE SEEMED ALMOST TOO MUCH WHEN MISSUS THORNTON STRONG AND PROSPEROUS WITH LIFE CAME IN MISSUS HALE LAY STILL
1813-142304-0011 BUT SHE DID NOT EVEN OPEN HER EYES FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
1813-142304-0012 OR OF HER LIVING DAUGHTER FANNY THAT STIRRED HER HEART AT LAST BUT A SUDDEN REMEMBRANCE SUGGESTED BY SOMETHING IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE ROOM OF A LITTLE DAUGHTER DEAD IN INFANCY LONG YEARS AGO THAT LIKE A SUDDEN SUNBEAM
1813-142304-0013 MELTED THE ICY CRUST BEHIND WHICH THERE WAS A REAL TENDER WOMAN
1813-142304-0014 MISSUS HALE HER EYES STILL FIXED ON MISSUS THORNTON'S FACE PRESSED THE HAND THAT LAY BELOW HERS ON THE COVERLET SHE COULD NOT SPEAK MISSUS THORNTON SIGHED I WILL BE A TRUE FRIEND IF CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE IT
1813-142304-0015 NOT A TENDER FRIEND THAT I CANNOT BE
1813-142304-0016 BUT SHE RELENTED AT THE SIGHT OF THAT POOR ANXIOUS FACE IS NOT MY NATURE TO SHOW AFFECTION EVEN WHERE I FEEL IT NOR DO I VOLUNTEER ADVICE IN GENERAL STILL AT YOUR REQUEST IF IT WILL BE ANY COMFORT TO YOU I WILL PROMISE YOU THEN CAME A PAUSE
1813-142304-0017 MISSUS THORNTON WAS TOO CONSCIENTIOUS TO PROMISE WHAT SHE DID NOT MEAN TO PERFORM AND TO PERFORM ANY THING IN THE WAY OF KINDNESS ON BEHALF OF MARGARET
1813-142304-0018 WAS DIFFICULT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE I PROMISE SAID SHE WITH GRAVE SEVERITY WHICH AFTER ALL INSPIRED THE DYING WOMAN WITH FAITH AS IN SOMETHING MORE STABLE THAN LIFE ITSELF
1813-142304-0019 BY SAYING THESE WORDS SHE WAS NOT SORRY THAT THEY WERE NOT HEARD SHE PRESSED MISSUS HALE'S SOFT LANGUID HAND AND ROSE UP AND WENT HER WAY OUT OF THE HOUSE WITHOUT SEEING A CREATURE
1813-142304-0020 DURING THE TIME THAT MISSUS THORNTON WAS HAVING THIS INTERVIEW WITH MISSUS HALE MARGARET AND DIXON WERE LAYING THEIR HEADS TOGETHER AND CONSULTING HOW THEY SHOULD KEEP FREDERICK'S COMING A PROFOUND SECRET TO ALL OUT OF THE HOUSE
1813-142304-0021 A LETTER FROM HIM MIGHT NOW BE EXPECTED ANY DAY AND HE WOULD ASSUREDLY FOLLOW QUICKLY ON ITS HEELS MARTHA MUST BE SENT AWAY ON HER HOLIDAY DIXON MUST KEEP STERN GUARD ON THE FRONT DOOR
1813-142304-0022 MISSUS HALE'S EXTREME ILLNESS GIVING HER A GOOD EXCUSE FOR THIS IF MARY HIGGINS WAS REQUIRED AS A HELP TO DIXON IN THE KITCHEN SHE WAS TO HEAR AND SEE AS LITTLE OF FREDERICK AS POSSIBLE AND HE WAS IF NECESSARY TO BE SPOKEN OF TO HER UNDER THE NAME OF MISTER DICKINSON
1813-142304-0023 BUT HER SLUGGISH AND INCURIOUS NATURE WAS THE GREATEST SAFEGUARD OF ALL
1813-142304-0024 MARGARET WISHED THAT SHE HAD BEEN SENT AWAY ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AS SHE FANCIED IT MIGHT BE THOUGHT STRANGE TO GIVE A SERVANT A HOLIDAY WHEN HER MISTRESS'S STATE REQUIRED SO MUCH ATTENDANCE POOR MARGARET ALL THAT AFTERNOON SHE HAD TO ACT THE PART OF A ROMAN DAUGHTER
1813-142304-0025 AND GIVE STRENGTH OUT OF HER OWN SCANTY STOCK TO HER FATHER MISTER HALE WOULD HOPE WOULD NOT DESPAIR
1813-142304-0026 HE BUOYED HIMSELF UP IN EVERY RESPITE FROM HER PAIN AND BELIEVED THAT IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF ULTIMATE RECOVERY AND SO WHEN THE PAROXYSMS CAME ON EACH MORE SEVERE THAN THE LAST THEY WERE FRESH AGONIES AND GREATER DISAPPOINTMENTS TO HIM
1813-142304-0027 THIS AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE DRAWING ROOM UNABLE TO BEAR THE SOLITUDE OF HIS STUDY OR TO EMPLOY HIMSELF IN ANY WAY HE BURIED HIS HEAD IN HIS ARMS WHICH LAY FOLDED ON THE TABLE MARGARET'S HEART ACHED TO SEE HIM
1813-142304-0028 YET AS HE DID NOT SPEAK SHE DID NOT LIKE TO VOLUNTEER ANY ATTEMPT AT COMFORT MARTHA WAS GONE DIXON SAT WITH MISSUS HALE WHILE SHE SLEPT THE HOUSE WAS VERY STILL AND QUIET AND DARKNESS CAME ON
1813-142304-0029 MARGARET SAT AT THE WINDOW
1813-142304-0030 SHE DID NOT LIKE TO GO DOWN FOR LIGHTS LEST THE TACIT RESTRAINT OF HER PRESENCE BEING WITHDRAWN HE MIGHT GIVE WAY TO MORE VIOLENT EMOTION WITHOUT HER BEING AT HAND TO COMFORT HIM
1813-142304-0031 WHICH THERE WAS NOBODY BUT HERSELF TO ATTEND TO WHEN SHE HEARD THE MUFFLED DOOR RING WITH SO VIOLENT A PULL THAT THE WIRES JINGLED ALL THROUGH THE HOUSE THOUGH THE POSITIVE SOUND WAS NOT GREAT SHE STARTED UP
1813-142304-0032 RETURNED AND KISSED HIM TENDERLY AND STILL HE NEVER MOVED NOR TOOK ANY NOTICE OF HER FOND EMBRACE THEN SHE WENT DOWN SOFTLY THROUGH THE DARK TO THE DOOR DIXON WOULD HAVE PUT THE CHAIN ON BEFORE SHE OPENED IT
1813-142304-0033 BUT MARGARET HAD NOT A THOUGHT OF FEAR IN HER PRE OCCUPIED MIND A MAN'S TALL FIGURE STOOD BETWEEN HER AND THE LUMINOUS STREET HE WAS LOOKING AWAY BUT AT THE SOUND OF THE LATCH HE TURNED QUICKLY ROUND IS THIS MISTER HALE'S SAID HE IN A CLEAR FULL DELICATE VOICE
1813-142304-0034 MARGARET TREMBLED ALL OVER AT FIRST SHE DID NOT ANSWER IN A MOMENT SHE SIGHED OUT FREDERICK AND STRETCHED OUT BOTH HER HANDS TO CATCH HIS AND DRAW HIM IN OH MARGARET SAID HE
1813-142304-0035 HOLDING HER OFF BY HER SHOULDERS AFTER THEY HAD KISSED EACH OTHER AS IF EVEN IN THAT DARKNESS HE COULD SEE HER FACE
1813-142304-0036 MY MOTHER IS SHE ALIVE YES SHE IS ALIVE DEAR DEAR BROTHER SHE AS ILL AS SHE CAN BE SHE IS BUT ALIVE SHE IS ALIVE THANK GOD SAID HE PAPA IS UTTERLY PROSTRATE WITH THIS GREAT GRIEF
1813-142304-0037 YOU EXPECT ME DON'T YOU NO
1813-142304-0038 GIVE ME YOUR HAND WHAT IS THIS OH YOUR CARPET BAG DIXON HAS SHUT THE SHUTTERS
1813-142304-0039 AND I CAN TAKE YOU TO A CHAIR TO REST YOURSELF FOR A FEW MINUTES WHILE I GO AND TELL HIM
1813-142304-0040 SHE SUDDENLY FELT SHY WHEN THE LITTLE FEEBLE LIGHT MADE THEM VISIBLE
1813-142304-0041 AND SHE CAUGHT THE STEALTHY LOOK OF A PAIR OF REMARKABLY LONG CUT BLUE EYES THAT SUDDENLY TWINKLED UP WITH A DROLL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THEIR MUTUAL PURPOSE OF INSPECTING EACH OTHER
1813-142304-0042 ONLY MARGARET FELT SURE THAT SHE SHOULD LIKE HER BROTHER AS A COMPANION
1813-142304-0043 HE THREW HIMSELF FORWARD AND HID HIS FACE ONCE MORE IN HIS STRETCHED OUT ARMS RESTING UPON THE TABLE AS HERETOFORE SHE HEARD HIM WHISPER SHE BENT TENDERLY DOWN TO LISTEN I DON'T KNOW
1813-142304-0044 I CANNOT BEAR IT I AM TOO WEAK AND HIS MOTHER IS DYING HE BEGAN TO CRY AND WAIL LIKE A CHILD
1813-142304-0045 THAT SHE TURNED SICK WITH DISAPPOINTMENT AND WAS SILENT FOR AN INSTANT THEN SHE SPOKE AGAIN VERY DIFFERENTLY NOT SO EXULTINGLY FAR MORE TENDERLY AND CAREFULLY PAPA IT IS FREDERICK THINK OF MAMMA
1813-142304-0046 HOW GLAD SHE WILL BE AND OH FOR HER SAKE HOW GLAD WE OUGHT TO BE FOR HIS SAKE TOO OUR POOR POOR BOY HER FATHER DID NOT CHANGE HIS ATTITUDE
1813-142304-0047 WHERE IS HE ASKED HE AT LAST HIS FACE STILL HIDDEN IN HIS PROSTRATE ARMS IN YOUR STUDY QUITE ALONE I LIGHTED THE TAPER AND RAN UP TO TELL YOU
1813-142304-0048 I WILL GO TO HIM BROKE IN HER FATHER AND HE LIFTED HIMSELF UP AND LEANT ON HER ARM AS ON THAT OF A GUIDE MARGARET LED HIM TO THE STUDY DOOR BUT HER SPIRITS WERE SO AGITATED THAT SHE FELT SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO SEE THE MEETING
1813-142304-0049 SHE TURNED AWAY AND RAN UP STAIRS AND CRIED MOST HEARTILY
1813-142304-0050 THE STRAIN HAD BEEN TERRIBLE AS SHE NOW FELT BUT FREDERICK WAS COME HE THE ONE PRECIOUS BROTHER WAS THERE SAFE AMONGST THEM AGAIN SHE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT SHE STOPPED HER CRYING AND OPENED HER BEDROOM DOOR SHE HEARD NO SOUND OF VOICES
1813-142304-0051 AND ALMOST FEARED SHE MIGHT HAVE DREAMT SHE WENT DOWN STAIRS AND LISTENED AT THE STUDY DOOR SHE HEARD THE BUZZ OF VOICES AND THAT WAS ENOUGH
1813-142304-0052 AND PREPARED FOR THE WANDERER'S REFRESHMENT
1813-142304-0053 SHE KNEW THAT SHE DID FROM THE CANDLE LIGHTER THRUST THROUGH THE KEYHOLE OF HER BEDROOM DOOR THE TRAVELLER COULD BE REFRESHED AND BRIGHT AND THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE MEETING WITH HIS FATHER ALL BE OVER BEFORE HER MOTHER BECAME AWARE OF ANYTHING UNUSUAL WHEN ALL WAS READY
1813-142304-0054 MARGARET OPENED THE STUDY DOOR AND WENT IN LIKE A SERVING MAIDEN WITH A HEAVY TRAY HELD IN HER EXTENDED ARMS SHE WAS PROUD OF SERVING FREDERICK BUT HE WHEN HE SAW HER SPRANG UP IN A MINUTE AND RELIEVED HER OF HER BURDEN
1813-142304-0055 THE BROTHER AND SISTER ARRANGED THE TABLE TOGETHER SAYING LITTLE BUT THEIR HANDS TOUCHING AND THEIR EYES SPEAKING THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF EXPRESSION SO INTELLIGIBLE TO THOSE OF THE SAME BLOOD THE FIRE HAD GONE OUT AND MARGARET APPLIED HERSELF TO LIGHT IT
1813-142304-0056 FOR THE EVENINGS HAD BEGUN TO BE CHILLY
1813-142304-0057 DIXON SAYS IT IS A GIFT TO LIGHT A FIRE NOT AN ART TO BE ACQUIRED POETA NASCITUR NON FIT MURMURED MISTER HALE AND MARGARET WAS GLAD TO HEAR A QUOTATION ONCE MORE HOWEVER LANGUIDLY GIVEN
1813-142304-0058 DEAR OLD DIXON HOW WE SHALL KISS EACH OTHER SAID FREDERICK
1813-142304-0059 AND THEN SET TO AGAIN BUT MARGARET WHAT A BUNGLER YOU ARE I NEVER SAW SUCH A LITTLE AWKWARD GOOD FOR NOTHING PAIR OF HANDS RUN AWAY AND WASH THEM READY TO CUT BREAD AND BUTTER FOR ME AND LEAVE THE FIRE I'LL MANAGE IT
1813-142304-0060 LIGHTING FIRES IS ONE OF MY NATURAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS SO MARGARET WENT AWAY AND RETURNED AND PASSED IN AND OUT OF THE ROOM IN A GLAD RESTLESSNESS THAT COULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITH SITTING STILL THE MORE WANTS FREDERICK HAD
1813-142304-0061 THE BETTER SHE WAS PLEASED AND HE UNDERSTOOD ALL THIS BY INSTINCT IT WAS A JOY SNATCHED IN THE HOUSE OF MOURNING AND THE ZEST OF IT WAS ALL THE MORE PUNGENT BECAUSE THEY KNEW IN THE DEPTHS OF THEIR HEARTS WHAT IRREMEDIABLE SORROW AWAITED THEM
1813-142304-0062 IN THE MIDDLE THEY HEARD DIXON'S FOOT ON THE STAIRS MISTER HALE STARTED FROM HIS LANGUID POSTURE IN HIS GREAT ARMCHAIR
1813-142304-0063 AS IF THEY WERE ACTING SOME DRAMA OF HAPPINESS
1813-142304-0064 BUT WHICH WAS DISTINCT FROM REALITY AND IN WHICH HE HAD NO PART HE STOOD UP AND FACED THE DOOR SHOWING SUCH A STRANGE SUDDEN ANXIETY TO CONCEAL FREDERICK FROM THE SIGHT OF ANY PERSON ENTERING EVEN THOUGH IT WERE THE FAITHFUL DIXON THAT A SHIVER CAME OVER MARGARET'S HEART
1813-142304-0065 IT REMINDED HER OF THE NEW FEAR IN THEIR LIVES SHE CAUGHT AT FREDERICK'S ARM AND CLUTCHED IT TIGHT WHILE A STERN THOUGHT COMPRESSED HER BROWS AND CAUSED HER TO SET HER TEETH AND YET THEY KNEW IT WAS ONLY DIXON'S MEASURED TREAD
1813-142304-0066 INTO THE KITCHEN MARGARET ROSE UP I WILL GO TO HER AND TELL HER
1813-142304-0067 MISSUS HALE WAS AWAKE SHE RAMBLED AT FIRST BUT AFTER THEY HAD GIVEN HER SOME TEA SHE WAS REFRESHED THOUGH NOT DISPOSED TO TALK IT WAS BETTER THAT THE NIGHT SHOULD PASS OVER BEFORE SHE WAS TOLD OF HER SON'S ARRIVAL
1813-142304-0068 DOCTOR DONALDSON'S APPOINTED VISIT WOULD BRING NERVOUS EXCITEMENT ENOUGH FOR THE EVENING
1813-142304-0069 HE WAS THERE IN THE HOUSE COULD BE SUMMONED AT ANY MOMENT MARGARET COULD NOT SIT STILL IT WAS A RELIEF TO HER TO AID DIXON IN ALL HER PREPARATIONS FOR MASTER FREDERICK
1813-142304-0070 EACH GLIMPSE INTO THE ROOM WHERE HE SATE BY HIS FATHER CONVERSING WITH HIM ABOUT SHE KNEW NOT WHAT NOR CARED TO KNOW WAS INCREASE OF STRENGTH TO HER HER OWN TIME FOR TALKING AND HEARING WOULD COME AT LAST
1813-142304-0071 AND SHE WAS TOO CERTAIN OF THIS TO FEEL IN A HURRY TO GRASP IT NOW SHE TOOK IN HIS APPEARANCE AND LIKED IT HE HAD DELICATE FEATURES REDEEMED FROM EFFEMINACY BY THE SWARTHINESS OF HIS COMPLEXION AND HIS QUICK INTENSITY OF EXPRESSION HIS EYES WERE GENERALLY MERRY LOOKING
1813-142304-0072 BUT THIS LOOK WAS ONLY FOR AN INSTANT
1813-142304-0073 IT WAS RATHER THE INSTANTANEOUS FEROCITY OF EXPRESSION THAT COMES OVER THE COUNTENANCES OF ALL NATIVES OF WILD OR SOUTHERN COUNTRIES
1813-142304-0074 MARGARET MIGHT FEAR THE VIOLENCE OF THE IMPULSIVE NATURE THUS OCCASIONALLY BETRAYED
1813-142304-0075 OR RECOIL IN THE LEAST FROM THE NEW FOUND BROTHER ON THE CONTRARY ALL THEIR INTERCOURSE WAS PECULIARLY CHARMING TO HER FROM THE VERY FIRST SHE KNEW THEN HOW MUCH RESPONSIBILITY SHE HAD HAD TO BEAR FROM THE EXQUISITE SENSATION OF RELIEF WHICH SHE FELT IN FREDERICK'S PRESENCE
1813-142304-0076 HE SEEMED TO KNOW INSTINCTIVELY WHEN A LITTLE OF THE NATURAL BRILLIANCY OF HIS MANNER AND CONVERSATION WOULD NOT JAR ON THE DEEP DEPRESSION OF HIS FATHER OR MIGHT RELIEVE HIS MOTHER'S PAIN
1813-142304-0077 HIS PATIENT DEVOTION AND WATCHFULNESS CAME INTO PLAY AND MADE HIM AN ADMIRABLE NURSE
1813-142304-0078 BY THE ALLUSIONS WHICH HE OFTEN MADE TO THEIR CHILDISH DAYS IN THE NEW FOREST HE HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN HER OR HELSTONE EITHER
1813-142304-0079 SHE MIGHT TALK TO HIM OF THE OLD SPOT
1813-142304-0080 EVEN WHILE SHE HAD LONGED FOR HIS COMING SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS HAD SHE FELT PRODUCED SUCH GREAT CHANGES IN HERSELF THAT FORGETTING HOW MUCH OF THE ORIGINAL MARGARET WAS LEFT SHE HAD REASONED THAT IF HER TASTES AND FEELINGS HAD SO MATERIALLY ALTERED EVEN IN HER STAY AT HOME LIFE
1813-142304-0081 WITH WHICH SHE WAS BUT IMPERFECTLY ACQUAINTED MUST HAVE ALMOST SUBSTITUTED ANOTHER FREDERICK FOR THE TALL STRIPLING IN HIS MIDDY'S UNIFORM
1813-142304-0082 BUT IN THEIR ABSENCE THEY HAD GROWN NEARER TO EACH OTHER IN AGE
1813-142304-0083 I HAVE CREDIT IN CADIZ SAID HE BUT NONE HERE OWING TO THIS WRETCHED CHANGE OF NAME WHY DID MY FATHER LEAVE HELSTONE THAT WAS THE BLUNDER
1813-142304-0084 MY LITTLE MARGARET SAID HE CARESSING HER LET US HOPE AS LONG AS WE CAN POOR LITTLE WOMAN WHAT IS THIS FACE ALL WET WITH TEARS I WILL HOPE I WILL IN SPITE OF A THOUSAND DOCTORS BEAR UP MARGARET AND BE BRAVE ENOUGH TO HOPE
1813-142304-0085 MARGARET CHOKED IN TRYING TO SPEAK
1813-142304-0086 I MUST TRY TO BE MEEK ENOUGH TO TRUST OH FREDERICK
1813-142304-0087 COME COME COME LET US GO UP STAIRS AND DO SOMETHING RATHER THAN WASTE TIME THAT MAY BE SO PRECIOUS THINKING HAS MANY A TIME MADE ME SAD DARLING BUT DOING NEVER DID IN ALL MY LIFE MY THEORY IS A SORT OF PARODY ON THE MAXIM OF
1813-142304-0088 GET MONEY MY SON HONESTLY IF YOU CAN BUT GET MONEY MY PRECEPT IS DO SOMETHING MY SISTER DO GOOD IF YOU CAN BUT AT ANY RATE DO SOMETHING NOT EXCLUDING MISCHIEF SAID MARGARET SMILING FAINTLY THROUGH HER TEARS BY NO MEANS
1813-142304-0089 WHAT I DO EXCLUDE IS THE REMORSE AFTERWARDS BLOT YOUR MISDEEDS OUT IF YOU ARE PARTICULARLY CONSCIENTIOUS
1813-142304-0090 JUST AS WE DID A CORRECT SUM AT SCHOOL ON THE SLATE
1813-142304-0091 BOTH LESS LOSS OF TIME WHERE TEARS HAD TO BE WAITED FOR AND A BETTER EFFECT AT LAST IF MARGARET THOUGHT FREDERICK'S THEORY RATHER A ROUGH ONE AT FIRST SHE SAW HOW HE WORKED IT OUT INTO CONTINUAL PRODUCTION OF KINDNESS IN FACT
1813-142304-0092 FOR HE INSISTED ON TAKING HIS TURN AS A SITTER UP HE WAS BUSY NEXT MORNING BEFORE BREAKFAST
1813-142304-0093 AT BREAKFAST TIME HE INTERESTED MISTER HALE WITH VIVID GRAPHIC RATTLING ACCOUNTS OF THE WILD LIFE HE HAD LED IN MEXICO SOUTH AMERICA AND ELSEWHERE
1813-142304-0094 IT WOULD EVEN HAVE AFFECTED HERSELF AND RENDERED HER INCAPABLE OF TALKING AT ALL BUT FRED TRUE TO HIS THEORY DID SOMETHING PERPETUALLY AND TALKING WAS THE ONLY THING TO BE DONE BESIDES EATING AT BREAKFAST BEFORE THE NIGHT OF THAT DAY
1813-142304-0095 BUT SHE KNEW THEM NOT SHE WOULD NEVER RECOGNISE THEM AGAIN TILL THEY MET IN HEAVEN BEFORE THE MORNING CAME ALL WAS OVER
1813-142304-0096 FOR FREDERICK HAD BROKEN DOWN NOW AND ALL HIS THEORIES WERE OF NO USE TO HIM HE CRIED SO VIOLENTLY WHEN SHUT UP ALONE IN HIS LITTLE ROOM AT NIGHT THAT MARGARET AND DIXON CAME DOWN IN AFFRIGHT TO WARN HIM TO BE QUIET
1813-142304-0097 SO DIFFERENT FROM THE SLOWER TREMBLING AGONY OF AFTER LIFE WHEN WE BECOME INURED TO GRIEF AND DARE NOT BE REBELLIOUS AGAINST THE INEXORABLE DOOM KNOWING WHO IT IS THAT DECREES MARGARET SATE WITH HER FATHER IN THE ROOM WITH THE DEAD
1813-142304-0098 BUT HE SATE BY THE BED QUITE QUIETLY ONLY FROM TIME TO TIME HE UNCOVERED THE FACE AND STROKED IT GENTLY
1813-142304-0099 AS IF HER AFFECTION DISTURBED HIM FROM HIS ABSORPTION IN THE DEAD HE STARTED WHEN HE HEARD FREDERICK'S CRIES AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
1813-142304-0100 POOR BOY HE SAID AND TOOK NO MORE NOTICE MARGARET'S HEART ACHED WITHIN HER SHE COULD NOT THINK OF HER OWN LOSS IN THINKING OF HER FATHER'S CASE THE NIGHT WAS WEARING AWAY AND THE DAY WAS AT HAND WHEN WITHOUT A WORD OF PREPARATION
