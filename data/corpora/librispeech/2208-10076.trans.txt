2208-10076-0000 THE FACT THAT LADY GRANT HAD GONE TO DRESDEN WAS NOT LONG IN REACHING THE EARS OF MISSUS WESTERN DICK ROSS HAD HEARD AT THE CLUB AT PERTH THAT SHE HAD GONE AND HAD TOLD SIR FRANCIS
2208-10076-0001 SIR FRANCIS PASSED ON THE NEWS TO MISS ALTIFIORLA AND FROM HER IT HAD REACHED THE DESERTED WIFE MISS ALTIFIORLA HAD NOT TOLD IT DIRECT BECAUSE AT THAT TIME SHE AND CECILIA WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
2208-10076-0002 ON FRIENDLY TERMS BUT THE TIDINGS HAD GOT ABOUT AND MISSUS WESTERN HAD HEARD THEM SHE'S A GOOD WOMAN SAID CECILIA TO HER MOTHER I KNEW HER TO BE THAT THE FIRST MOMENT THAT SHE CAME TO ME
2208-10076-0003 SHE IS ROUGH AS HE IS AND STERN AND HAS A WILL OF HER OWN BUT HER HEART IS TENDER AND TRUE AS IS HIS ALSO AT THE CORE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SAID MISSUS HOLT WITH THE ANGRY TONE
2208-10076-0004 WHICH SHE ALLOWED HERSELF TO USE ONLY WHEN SPEAKING OF MISTER WESTERN YES HE IS MAMMA IN YOUR AFFECTION FOR ME YOU WILL NOT ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE JUST TO HIM IN TRUTH YOU HARDLY KNOW HIM
2208-10076-0005 I KNOW THAT HE HAS DESTROYED YOUR HAPPINESS FOR EVER AND MADE ME VERY WRETCHED
2208-10076-0006 IT MAY BE THAT HE WILL COME FOR ME AND THAT THEN WE SHALL BE AS HAPPY AS THE DAY IS LONG AS SHE SAID THIS A VISION CAME BEFORE HER EYES OF THE BIRTH OF HER CHILD AND OF HER SURROUNDINGS AT THE TIME THE ANXIOUS SOLICITUDE OF A LOVING HUSBAND
2208-10076-0007 THE CARE OF ATTENDANTS WHO WOULD BE HAPPY BECAUSE SHE WAS HAPPY THE CONGRATULATIONS OF FRIENDS AND THE SMILES OF THE WORLD BUT ABOVE ALL SHE PICTURED TO HERSELF HER HUSBAND STANDING BY HER BEDSIDE WITH THE CHILD IN HIS ARMS
2208-10076-0008 THE DREAM HAD BEEN DREAMED BEFORE AND WAS RE DREAMED DURING EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY LADY GRANT IS STRONG SHE CONTINUED AND CAN PLEAD FOR ME BETTER THAN I COULD PLEAD
2208-10076-0009 PLEAD FOR YOU WHY SHOULD THERE BE ANYONE WANTED TO PLEAD FOR YOU WILL LADY GRANT PLEAD WITH YOU FOR HER BROTHER IT IS NOT NECESSARY MY OWN HEART PLEADS FOR HIM IT IS BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN IN THE WRONG
2208-10076-0010 THAT AN INTERCESSOR IS NECESSARY FOR ME IT IS THEY WHO COMMIT THE INJURY THAT HAVE A DIFFICULTY IN FORGIVING IF HE CAME TO ME DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT I SHOULD THROW MYSELF INTO HIS ARMS AND BE THE HAPPIEST WOMAN
2208-10076-0011 IN THE WORLD WITHOUT A WORD SPOKEN THE CONVERSATION WAS NOT THEN CARRIED FURTHER BUT MISSUS HOLT CONTINUED TO SHAKE HER HEAD AS SHE SATE AT HER KNITTING IN HER ESTIMATION NO HUSBAND COULD HAVE BEHAVED WORSE
2208-10076-0012 THAN HAD HER SON IN LAW AND SHE WAS OF OPINION THAT HE SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR HIS MISCONDUCT BEFORE THINGS COULD BE MADE SMOOTH AGAIN SOME DAYS AFTERWARDS MISS ALTIFIORLA CALLED AT THE HOUSE AND SENT IN A NOTE
2208-10076-0013 WHILE SHE STOOD WAITING IN THE HALL IN THE NOTE SHE MERELY ASKED WHETHER HER DEAR CECILIA WOULD BE WILLING TO RECEIVE HER AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED SHE HAD NEWS TO TELL OF MUCH IMPORTANCE AND SHE HOPED THAT HER DEAR CECILIA WOULD RECEIVE HER
2208-10076-0014 THERE HAD BEEN NO ABSOLUTE QUARREL NO QUARREL KNOWN TO THE SERVANTS AND CECILIA DID RECEIVE HER OH MY DEAR SHE SAID BUSTLING INTO THE ROOM WITH AN AIR OF AFFECTED IMPORTANCE YOU WILL BE SURPRISED
2208-10076-0015 I THINK THAT YOU MUST BE SURPRISED AT WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU I WILL BE SURPRISED IF YOU WISH IT SAID CECILIA LET ME FIRST BEGIN BY ASSURING YOU THAT YOU MUST NOT MAKE LIGHT OF MY NEWS IT IS OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE
2208-10076-0016 NOT ONLY TO ME BUT OF SOME IMPORTANCE ALSO TO YOU IT SHALL BE OF IMPORTANCE BECAUSE YOU BEGIN WITH THAT LITTLE SNEER WHICH HAS BECOME SO COMMON WITH YOU
2208-10076-0017 YOU MUST BE AWARE OF IT AMIDST THE TROUBLES OF YOUR OWN LIFE WHICH WE ALL ADMIT TO BE VERY GRIEVOUS THERE HAS COME UPON YOU A WAY OF THINKING THAT NO ONE ELSE'S AFFAIRS CAN BE OF ANY IMPORTANCE
2208-10076-0018 IT IS SO A LITTLE AND PRAY BELIEVE ME THAT I AM NOT IN THE LEAST ANGRY ABOUT IT I KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE SO WHEN I CAME TO YOU THIS MORNING AND YET I COULD NOT HELP COMING
2208-10076-0019 INDEED AS THE THING HAS NOW BEEN MADE KNOWN TO THE DEAN'S FAMILY I COULD NOT BEAR THAT YOU SHOULD BE LEFT ANY LONGER IN IGNORANCE WHAT IS THE THING THERE IT IS AGAIN THAT SNEER I CANNOT TELL YOU UNLESS YOU WILL INTEREST YOURSELF
2208-10076-0020 DOES NOTHING INTEREST YOU NOW BEYOND YOUR OWN MISFORTUNES ALAS NO I FEAR NOT BUT THIS SHALL INTEREST YOU YOU MUST BE AWAKED TO THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD ESPECIALLY SUCH AN AFFAIR AS THIS
2208-10076-0021 YOU MUST BE SHAKEN UP THIS I SUPPOSE WILL SHAKE YOU UP IF NOT YOU MUST BE PAST ALL HOPE WHAT ON EARTH IS IT SIR FRANCIS GERALDINE
2208-10076-0022 WELL YES I HAVE NOT AS YET FORGOTTEN THE NAME I SHOULD THINK NOT SIR FRANCIS GERALDINE HAS AND THEN SHE PAUSED AGAIN CUT HIS LITTLE FINGER SAID CECILIA HAD SHE DREAMED OF WHAT WAS TO COME SHE WOULD NOT HAVE TURNED SIR FRANCIS
2208-10076-0023 INTO RIDICULE BUT SHE HAD BEEN AWARE OF MISS ALTIFIORLA'S FRIENDSHIP WITH SIR FRANCIS OR RATHER WHAT SHE HAD REGARDED AS AN AFFECTATION OF FRIENDSHIP AND DID NOT FOR A MOMENT ANTICIPATE SUCH A COMMUNICATION AS WAS
2208-10076-0024 TO BE MADE TO HER CECILIA HOLT THAT AT ANY RATE IS NOT MY NAME I DARE SAY YOU WISH IT WERE I WOULD NOT CHANGE MY REAL NAME FOR THAT OF ANY WOMAN UNDER THE SUN
2208-10076-0025 PERHAPS NOT BUT THERE ARE OTHER WOMEN IN A POSITION OF LESS GRANDEUR I AM GOING TO CHANGE MINE NO I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED BECAUSE IT WOULD LOOK AS THOUGH I WERE ABOUT TO ABANDON MY GREAT DOCTRINE
2208-10076-0026 IT IS NOT SO MY OPINIONS ON THAT GREAT SUBJECT ARE NOT IN THE LEAST CHANGED BUT OF COURSE THERE MUST BE SOME WOMEN WHOM THE EXIGENCIES OF THE WORLD WILL REQUIRE TO MARRY A GOOD MANY FIRST AND LAST
2208-10076-0027 ALLY MYSELF THEN THERE WAS A PAUSE AND THE SPEAKER DISCOVERED WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE THAT SHE WAS VERGING ON THE RIDICULOUS IN DECLARING HER PURPOSE OF FORMING AN ALLIANCE THAT IS TO SAY I AM GOING TO MARRY SIR FRANCIS GERALDINE
2208-10076-0028 SIR FRANCIS GERALDINE DO YOU SEE ANY JUST CAUSE OR IMPEDIMENT NONE IN THE LEAST AND YET HOW AM I TO ANSWER SUCH A QUESTION I SAW CAUSE OR IMPEDIMENT WHY I SHOULD NOT MARRY HIM YOU
2208-10076-0029 BOTH SAW IT I SUPPOSE SAID MISS ALTIFIORLA WITH AN AIR OF GRANDEUR YOU BOTH SUPPOSED THAT YOU WERE NOT MADE FOR EACH OTHER AND WISELY DETERMINED TO GIVE UP THE IDEA YOU DID NOT REMAIN SINGLE AND I SUPPOSE WE NEED NOT EITHER
2208-10076-0030 CERTAINLY NOT FOR MY SAKE OUR INTIMACY SINCE THAT TIME HAS BEEN INCREASED BY CIRCUMSTANCES AND WE HAVE NOW DISCOVERED THAT WE CAN BOTH OF US BEST SUIT OUR OWN INTERESTS BY AN
2208-10076-0031 AN ALLIANCE SUGGESTED MISSUS WESTERN IF YOU PLEASE THOUGH I AM QUITE AWARE THAT YOU USE THE TERM AS A SNEER AS TO THIS MISSUS WESTERN WAS TOO HONEST TO DENY THE TRUTH AND REMAINED SILENT I THOUGHT IT PROPER
2208-10076-0032 CONTINUED MISS ALTIFIORLA AS WE HAD BEEN SO LONG FRIENDS TO INFORM YOU THAT IT WILL BE SO YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE AND AS YOU LET IT SLIP I TRUST THAT YOU WILL NOT ENVY ME MINE NOT IN THE LEAST
2208-10076-0033 AT ANY RATE YOU DO NOT CONGRATULATE ME I HAVE BEEN VERY REMISS I ACKNOWLEDGE IT BUT UPON MY WORD THE NEWS HAS SO STARTLED ME THAT I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REMEMBER THE COMMON COURTESIES OF THE WORLD
2208-10076-0034 I THOUGHT WHEN I HEARD OF YOUR TRAVELLING UP TO LONDON TOGETHER THAT YOU WERE BECOMING VERY INTIMATE OH IT HAD BEEN EVER SO MUCH BEFORE THAT THE INTIMACY AT LEAST
2208-10076-0035 OF COURSE I DID NOT KNOW HIM BEFORE HE CAME TO THIS HOUSE BUT A GREAT MANY THINGS HAVE HAPPENED SINCE THAT HAVE THERE NOT WELL GOOD BYE DEAR I HAVE NO DOUBT WE SHALL CONTINUE AS FRIENDS ESPECIALLY AS WE SHALL BE LIVING ALMOST IN THE
2208-10076-0036 NEIGHBOURHOOD CASTLE GERALD IS TO BE AT ONCE FITTED UP FOR ME AND I HOPE YOU WILL FORGET ALL OUR LITTLE TIFFS AND OFTEN COME AND STAY WITH ME SO SAYING MISS ALTIFIORLA
2208-10076-0037 HAVING TOLD HER GRAND NEWS MADE HER ADIEUS AND WENT AWAY A GREAT MANY THINGS HAVE HAPPENED SINCE THAT SAID CECILIA REPEATING TO HERSELF HER FRIEND'S WORDS IT SEEMED TO HER TO BE
2208-10076-0038 SO MANY THAT A LIFETIME HAD BEEN WASTED SINCE SIR FRANCIS HAD FIRST COME TO THAT HOUSE SHE HAD WON THE LOVE OF THE BEST MAN SHE HAD EVER KNOWN AND MARRIED HIM AND HAD THEN LOST HIS LOVE
2208-10076-0039 AND NOW SHE HAD BEEN LEFT AS A WIDOWED WIFE WITH ALL THE COMING TROUBLES OF MATERNITY ON HER HEAD SHE HAD UNDERSTOOD WELL THE ILL NATURED SARCASM OF MISS ALTIFIORLA WE SHALL BE LIVING ALMOST IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD
2208-10076-0040 YES IF HER SEPARATION FROM HER HUSBAND WAS TO BE CONTINUED THEN UNDOUBTEDLY SHE WOULD LIVE AT EXETER AND AS FAR AS THE LIMITS OF THE COUNTY WERE CONCERNED SHE WOULD BE THE NEIGHBOUR OF THE FUTURE LADY GERALDINE
2208-10076-0041 THAT SHE SHOULD EVER WILLINGLY BE FOUND UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH SIR FRANCIS WAS AS SHE KNEW WELL AS IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS ALTIFIORLA AS TO HERSELF THE INVITATION CONTAINED THE SNEER AND WAS INTENDED TO CONTAIN IT
2208-10076-0042 BUT IT CREATED NO ANGER SHE TOO HAD SNEERED AT MISS ALTIFIORLA QUITE AS BITTERLY THEY HAD EACH LEARNED TO DESPISE THE OTHER AND NOT TO SNEER WAS IMPOSSIBLE
2208-10076-0043 MISS ALTIFIORLA HAD COME TO TELL OF HER TRIUMPH AND TO SNEER IN RETURN BUT IT MATTERED NOTHING WHAT DID MATTER WAS WHETHER THAT THREAT SHOULD COME TRUE SHOULD SHE ALWAYS BE LEFT LIVING
2208-10076-0044 AT EXETER WITH HER MOTHER THEN SHE DREAMED HER DREAM AGAIN THAT HE HAD COME BACK TO HER AND WAS SITTING BY HER BEDSIDE WITH HIS HAND IN HERS AND WHISPERING SWEET WORDS TO HER
2208-10076-0045 WHILE A BABY WAS LYING IN HER ARMS HIS CHILD AS SHE THOUGHT OF THE BLISS OF THE FANCIED MOMENT THE STILL POSSIBLE BLISS HER ANGER SEEMED TO FADE AWAY WHAT WOULD SHE NOT DO TO BRING HIM BACK
2208-10076-0046 WHAT WOULD SHE NOT SAY SHE HAD DONE AMISS IN KEEPING THAT SECRET SO LONG AND THOUGH THE PUNISHMENT HAD BEEN SEVERE IT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER UNDESERVED IT HAD COME TO HIM AS A TERRIBLE BLOW AND HE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO SUPPRESS
2208-10076-0047 HIS AGONY HE SHOULD NOT HAVE TREATED HER SO NO HE SHOULD NOT HAVE SENT HER AWAY BUT SHE COULD MAKE EXCUSES NOW WHICH BUT A FEW WEEKS SINCE SEEMED TO HER TO BE IMPOSSIBLE AND SHE UNDERSTOOD
2208-10076-0048 SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HERSELF AS A WOMAN AND HIM AS A MAN
2208-10076-0049 TO COMMAND A RIGHT TO BE OBEYED A RIGHT TO BE MASTER HE HAD A RIGHT TO KNOW ALL THE SECRETS OF HER HEART AND TO BE OFFENDED WHEN ONE SO IMPORTANT HAD BEEN KEPT FROM HIM
2208-10076-0050 HE HAD LIFTED HIS HAND IN GREAT WRATH AND THE BLOW HE HAD STRUCK HAD BEEN AWFUL BUT SHE WOULD BEAR IT WITHOUT A WORD OF COMPLAINT IF ONLY HE WOULD COME BACK TO HER
2208-10076-0051 AS SHE THOUGHT OF IT SHE DECLARED TO HERSELF THAT SHE MUST DIE IF HE DID NOT COME BACK TO LIVE AS SHE WAS LIVING NOW WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO HER BUT IF HE WOULD COME BACK HOW ABSOLUTELY WOULD SHE DISREGARD ALL THAT THE WORLD MIGHT SAY
2208-10076-0052 AS TO THEIR SHORT QUARREL IT WOULD INDEED BE KNOWN TO ALL THE WORLD BUT WHAT COULD THE WORLD DO TO HER IF SHE ONCE AGAIN HAD HER HUSBAND BY HER SIDE
2208-10076-0053 WHEN THE BLOW FIRST FELL ON HER SHE HAD THOUGHT MUCH OF THE IGNOMINY WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HER AND WHICH MUST EVER REST WITH HER EVEN THOUGH SHE SHOULD BE TAKEN BACK AGAIN PEOPLE WOULD KNOW THAT SHE HAD BEEN DISCARDED
2208-10076-0054 BUT NOW SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT FOR THAT SHE CARED NOT AT ALL THEN SHE AGAIN DREAMED HER DREAM HER CHILD WAS BORN AND HER HUSBAND WAS STANDING BY HER WITH THAT SWEET MANLY SMILE UPON HIS FACE
2208-10076-0055 SHE PUT OUT HER HAND AS THOUGH HE WOULD TOUCH IT AND WAS CONSCIOUS OF AN INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENT AS THOUGH SHE WERE BENDING HER FACE TOWARDS HIM FOR A KISS SURELY HE WOULD COME TO HER HIS SISTER HAD GONE TO HIM
2208-10076-0056 AND WOULD HAVE TOLD HIM THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH SHE HAD NEVER SINNED AGAINST HIM EVEN BY INTENTIONAL SILENCE THERE HAD BEEN NO THOUGHT OF HERS SINCE SHE HAD BEEN HIS WIFE WHICH HE HAD NOT BEEN WELCOME TO SHARE
2208-10076-0057 IT HAD IN TRUTH BEEN FOR HIS SAKE RATHER THAN FOR HER OWN THAT SHE HAD BEEN SILENT SHE WAS AWARE THAT FROM COWARDICE HER SILENCE HAD BEEN PROLONGED BUT SURELY NOW AT LAST HE WOULD FORGIVE HER THAT OFFENCE
2208-10076-0058 THEN SHE THOUGHT OF THE WORDS SHE WOULD USE AS SHE OWNED HER FAULT HE WAS A MAN AND AS A MAN HAD A RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT SHE WOULD CONFESS IT IF HE WOULD COME TO HER AND STAND ONCE AGAIN WITH HIS ARM ROUND HER WAIST
2208-10076-0059 SHE WOULD CONFESS IT MY DEAR HERE IS A LETTER THE POSTMAN HAS JUST BROUGHT IT SHE TOOK THE LETTER FROM HER MOTHER'S HAND AND HARDLY KNEW WHETHER TO BE PLEASED OR DISAPPOINTED WHEN SHE FOUND THAT THE ADDRESS
2208-10076-0060 WAS IN THE HANDWRITING OF LADY GRANT LADY GRANT WOULD OF COURSE WRITE WHETHER WITH GOOD NEWS OR WITH BAD THE ADDRESS TOLD HER NOTHING BUT YET SHE COULD NOT TEAR THE ENVELOPE
2208-10076-0061 SHE TURNED A SOFT SUPPLICATING PAINFUL LOOK UP TO HER MOTHER'S FACE AS SHE BEGGED FOR GRACE I WILL GO UP STAIRS MAMMA AND WILL TELL YOU BY AND BY THEN SHE LEFT THE ROOM WITH THE LETTER UNOPENED IN HER HAND
2208-10076-0062 IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT SHE COULD EXAMINE ITS CONTENTS SO APPREHENSIVE WAS SHE AND YET SO HOPEFUL SO CONFIDENT AT ONE MOMENT OF HER COMING HAPPINESS AND YET SO FEARFUL AT ANOTHER THAT SHE SHOULD BE AGAIN ENVELOPED
2208-10076-0063 IN THE DARKNESS OF HER MISERY BUT SHE DID AT LAST PERSUADE HERSELF TO READ THE WORDS WHICH LADY GRANT HAD WRITTEN THEY WERE VERY SHORT AND RAN AS FOLLOWS MY DEAR CECILIA MY BROTHER RETURNS WITH ME
2208-10076-0064 AND WILL AT ONCE GO DOWN TO EXETER THE SHOCK OF HER JOY WAS SO GREAT THAT SHE COULD HARDLY SEE WHAT FOLLOWED HE WILL HOPE TO REACH THAT PLACE ON THE FIFTEENTH BY THE TRAIN WHICH LEAVES LONDON AT NINE IN THE MORNING THAT WAS ALL BUT THAT
2208-10076-0065 WAS ENOUGH SHE WAS SURE THAT HE WOULD NOT COME WITH THE PURPOSE OF TELLING HER THAT HE MUST AGAIN LEAVE HER AND SHE WAS SURE ALSO THAT IF HE WOULD ONCE PUT HIMSELF WITHIN THE SPHERE OF HER PERSONAL INFLUENCE IT SHOULD BE SO USED
2208-10076-0066 THAT HE WOULD NEVER LEAVE HER AGAIN OF COURSE HE IS COMING I KNEW HE WOULD COME WHY SHOULD HE NOT COME THIS SHE EXCLAIMED TO HER MOTHER AND THEN WENT ON TO SPEAK OF HIM WITH A WILD RHAPSODY OF JOY AS THOUGH THERE HAD
2208-10076-0067 HARDLY BEEN ANY BREACH IN HER HAPPINESS AND SHE CONTINUED TO SING THE PRAISES OF HER HUSBAND TILL MISSUS HOLT HARDLY KNEW HOW TO BEAR HER ENTHUSIASM IN A FITTING MOOD FOR SHE
2208-10076-0068 HAD BEEN SCANDALOUS WICKED AND CRUEL AND IF TO BE FORGIVEN ONLY TO BE FORGIVEN BECAUSE OF THE GENERAL WICKEDNESS AND CRUELTY OF MAN
2208-10076-0069 IT HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT LADY GRANT INDUCED HER BROTHER TO ASSENT TO HER WRITING THE LETTER WHICH HAS BEEN GIVEN ABOVE WHEN HE HAD AGREED TO RETURN WITH HER TO ENGLAND
2208-10076-0070 HE HAD NO DOUBT ASSENTED TO HER ASSERTION THAT HE WAS BOUND TO TAKE HIS WIFE BACK AGAIN EVEN WITHOUT ANY CONFESSION AND THIS HAD BEEN SO MUCH TO GAIN HAD BEEN SO FELT TO BE THE ONE
2208-10076-0071 ONLY MATERIAL POINT NECESSARY THAT HE WAS NOT PRESSED AS TO HIS MANNER OF DOING IT BUT BEFORE THEY REACHED LONDON IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT SOME ARRANGEMENT SHOULD BE MADE FOR BRINGING THEM TOGETHER
2208-10076-0072 COULD NOT I GO DOWN TO DURTON HE HAD SAID AND COULD NOT SHE COME TO ME THERE NO DOUBT HE MIGHT HAVE GONE TO DURTON AND NO DOUBT SHE WOULD HAVE GONE TO HIM IF ASKED SHE WOULD HAVE FLOWN TO HIM AT DRESDEN OR
2208-10076-0073 TO JERUSALEM AT A WORD SPOKEN BY HIM ABSENCE HAD MADE HIM SO PRECIOUS TO HER THAT SHE WOULD HAVE OBEYED THE SLIGHTEST BEHEST WITH JOY AS LONG AS THE ORDER GIVEN WERE TO BRING THEM ONCE MORE TOGETHER
2208-10076-0074 BUT OF THIS LADY GRANT WAS NOT AWARE AND HAD SHE BEEN SO THE SENSE OF WHAT WAS BECOMING WOULD HAVE RESTRAINED HER I THINK GEORGE THAT YOU HAD BETTER GO TO EXETER SHE SAID SHOULD WE NOT
2208-10076-0075 BE MORE COMFORTABLE AT DURTON I THINK THAT WHEN AT DURTON YOU WILL BE MORE HAPPY IF YOU SHALL YOURSELF HAVE FETCHED HER FROM HER MOTHER'S HOME I THINK YOU OWE IT TO YOUR WIFE TO GO TO HER AND MAKE THE JOURNEY WITH HER
2208-10076-0076 WHAT IS YOUR OBJECTION I DO NOT WISH TO BE SEEN IN EXETER HE REPLIED NOR DID SHE YOU MAY BE SURE WHEN SHE RETURNED THERE ALONE BUT WHAT DOES IT MATTER IF YOU CAN BE HAPPY IN ONCE MORE POSSESSING HER
