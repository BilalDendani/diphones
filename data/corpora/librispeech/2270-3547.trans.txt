2270-3547-0000 SAVED THAT NIGHT ON OUR RETURN WE POURED INTO TERESA'S SYMPATHETIC EARS ALL THAT HAD OCCURRED DURING OUR EVENTFUL VISIT THAT AFTERNOON AT CELESTINA'S HOUSE THEN SOMEWHAT LATER AS I WAS HELPING HER WITH THE DISHES IN THE KITCHEN TERESA SAID DO YOU KNOW LISITA
2270-3547-0001 IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IN THE LEAST TO SEE THE BRETON CONVERTED
2270-3547-0002 NO ONE SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO RESIST PAULA WHEN SHE BEGINS TO SPEAK OF GOD'S LOVE SHE SEEMS TRULY INSPIRED BY HIS HOLY SPIRIT CHILD THOUGH SHE IS SHE SURELY IS HIS MESSENGER TO ALL WITH WHOM SHE COMES IN CONTACT BUT THERE'S JUST ONE THING
2270-3547-0003 AND TERESA SEEMED TO HESITATE TO EXPRESS HERSELF THEN FINALLY SHE CONTINUED I CANNOT SEEM TO SHAKE OFF THE FEELING THAT SHE WILL NOT BE WITH US MUCH LONGER I BELIEVE SOMEHOW I KNOW IT SOUNDS ABSURD IN ONE WAY
2270-3547-0004 BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT GOD WILL CALL HER TO HIS SIDE SOME DAY SOON OH TERESA I CRIED HOW CAN YOU SAY SUCH A THING
2270-3547-0005 SHE'S MUCH BIGGER AND STRONGER AND MORE VIGOROUS THAN EVEN I AM AND BESIDES I NEVER NEVER COULD BEAR IT TO HAVE PAULA TAKEN FROM ME HUSH HUSH CHILD DON'T SHOUT THAT WAY
2270-3547-0006 SHE LOOKED AT ME SURPRISED
2270-3547-0007 SHE LAUGHED WHAT PUT SUCH A NOTION IN YOUR HEAD DO I LOOK AS IF I WAS SICK I WAS SO RELIEVED TERESA WAS QUITE MISTAKEN NO CONTINUED PAULA
2270-3547-0008 IN FACT AS I LOOK AROUND AND SEE SO MUCH SICKNESS AND SUFFERING
2270-3547-0009 AND AS I LOOKED AT HER TALL WELL DEVELOPED FIGURE OUTLINED AGAINST THE WINDOW I LAUGHED AT MY FOOLISH FEARS
2270-3547-0010 AND AS I LOOKED AT THAT PURE BEAUTIFUL FACE WITH THE EYES CLOSED IN PRAYER WITH ITS FRAME OF GLORIOUS HAIR I KNEW THAT NEVER HAD I SEEN ANYTHING SO LOVELY AS THIS CHILD COMPANION OF MINE JUST BUDDING INTO WOMANHOOD
2270-3547-0011 WHO HAD COME INTO MY LIFE AND WHO HAD TRANSFORMED SO MANY OTHER LIVES AROUND ME AS SHE ROSE AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PRAYER FINDING ME STILL ON MY FEET SHE SAID WITH SURPRISE IN HER TONE NOT IN BED YET LISITA NO
2270-3547-0012 I SAID CONFUSED THAT SHE SHOULD FIND ME STILL SEATED ON THE EDGE OF MY BED LOST IN MY OWN REFLECTIONS PAULA SUDDENLY WENT TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT OH LISITA SHE EXCLAIMED
2270-3547-0013 THE STORM HAD STOPPED IN THE LATE AFTERNOON
2270-3547-0014 TOUCHING THE SNOW WITH SILVER AND MAKING MILLIONS OF ITS CRYSTALS SPARKLE LIKE DIAMONDS IN THE MOONLIGHT HOW WHITE AND PURE AND BEAUTIFUL EVERYTHING IS SAID PAULA
2270-3547-0015 SHE HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN CONTINUED IN HER QUIET SIMPLE WAY
2270-3547-0016 HE TAKES IT STAINED AND SCARRED WITH SIN AND THEN HE MAKES IT WHITE LIKE THE SNOW DON'T YOU SEE LISITA YES I SEE I SAID DO YOU REALLY SEE DEAR LISITA
2270-3547-0017 BUT WHEN I GET THINKING OF THE FACT THAT YOU NEVER REALLY HAVE GIVEN YOUR HEART TO HIM AND IF ONE OF US SHOULD DIE I COULD NOT BEAR ANOTHER WORD THE VERY IDEA OF DEATH EITHER FOR PAULA OR MYSELF WAS SIMPLY UNBEARABLE STOP I CRIED
2270-3547-0018 IN SUCH A TERRIBLE TONE THAT PAULA I COULD SEE WAS FRIGHTENED YOU MUSTN'T DIE I CANNOT LIVE AND I WON'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU I KNOW I'M NOT GOOD BUT IF YOU WEREN'T HERE TO HELP ME WHAT WOULD I DO MY OVERWROUGHT NERVES
2270-3547-0019 WERE TOO MUCH FOR ME AND HERE I BROKE DOWN COMPLETELY
2270-3547-0020 YOU MUST GET TO BED AND DON'T LET'S TALK ANY MORE TONIGHT I DREAMED OF PAULA THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG I SAW HER EITHER DYING OR DEAD OR IN HEAVEN WITH THE ANGELS BUT IN THE MORNING ALL MY FEARS HAD DISAPPEARED AND A FEW DAYS LATER I EVEN FORGOT THE WHOLE THING
2270-3547-0021 A WEEK PASSED AND WE HAD SEEN NOTHING OF THE BRETON PAULA MENTIONED HIM SEVERAL TIMES
2270-3547-0022 APPARENTLY HE HAD GONE OUT EARLY EACH DAY AND HAD RETURNED VERY LATE HE HAD BEEN THE PRINCIPAL SUBJECT OF OUR CONVERSATION AS EACH NIGHT WE CAME TOGETHER IN THE BIG WARM KITCHEN ON THOSE LONG WINTER EVENINGS
2270-3547-0023 THERE CAME TWO HESITATING KNOCKS ON THE OUTER DOOR
2270-3547-0024 IT SOUNDS LIKE SOME CHILD THAT CAN'T KNOCK VERY WELL SAID CATALINA
2270-3547-0025 ONLY TOO GLAD TO ABANDON MY TOWEL I RAN TO OPEN THE DOOR BUT HARDLY HAD I DONE SO WHEN I REMAINED PETRIFIED AND DUMB WITH SURPRISE HARDLY ABLE TO BELIEVE MY OWN EYES THERE STOOD THE BRETON TWISTING HIS BATTERED CAP NERVOUSLY BETWEEN HIS BONY FINGERS
2270-3547-0026 THE LITTLE OIL LAMP WHICH WE ALWAYS KEPT LIGHTED AT NIGHT IN THE PASSAGEWAY ILLUMINATED HIS PALE FACE AND GAUNT FIGURE GOOD EVENING MADEMOISELLE HE FINALLY MANAGED TO SAY AND THEN HE STOPPED APPARENTLY AS EMBARRASSED AS I WAS
2270-3547-0027 AS SHE STARTED TO COME TO MY RESCUE IT'S THE BRETON I SAID
2270-3547-0028 SAID THE OLD WOMAN KINDLY AS TIMIDLY AS A CHILD THE BRETON ADVANCED OVER THE THRESHOLD A FEW PACES
2270-3547-0029 I WISH TO SPEAK WITH THE MASTER HE SAID DIRECTING HIS WORDS TO TERESA
2270-3547-0030 I DECLARE SAID ROSA THINK OF THE BRETON
2270-3547-0031 THE BRETON KNOWS VERY WELL THAT WHEN YOUR FATHER GOT RID OF HIM HE WELL DESERVED IT SAID TERESA AS SHE ADJUSTED HER SPECTACLES AND SETTLED DOWN TO HER KNITTING MY FATHER DID NOT KEEP HIM LONG
2270-3547-0032 FROM THE KITCHEN WE COULD HEAR THE DOOR OPEN AND MY FATHER'S VOICE BIDDING THE BRETON A KINDLY GOOD NIGHT
2270-3547-0033 GO TELL THE BRETON TO COME INTO THE KITCHEN LISITA SAID TERESA I WONDERED AS I SAW HIM ENTER WITH SUCH A HUMBLE FRANK AIR AND WITH A NEW LOOK OF PEACE THAT SEEMED ALMOST TO BEAUTIFY THE BRUTALIZED FACE MADEMOISELLE PAULA
2270-3547-0034 HE SAID AS HE STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR KITCHEN
2270-3547-0035 MY HEAD WASN'T IN VERY GOOD CONDITION AS I'D LEFT MY WITS BEHIND AT THE LIQUOR SHOP
2270-3547-0036 AND YOU ALSO SAID THAT GOD WOULD CHANGE ME IF I REALLY DESIRED I DIDN'T DARE BELIEVE SUCH A THING MADEMOISELLE IT
2270-3547-0037 THAT NIGHT I SIMPLY COULDN'T SLEEP I SEEMED TO FEEL MY HANDS IN YOURS AND TO HEAR YOUR VOICE SAYING I'LL DO WHAT I CAN TO HELP YOU AT LAST I COULDN'T STAND IT ANY LONGER I GOT OUT ON THE FLOOR AND KNEELED THERE BEFORE GOD
2270-3547-0038 I DESERVED TO BE REFUSED
2270-3547-0039 AND NOW MADEMOISELLE WILL YOU CONTINUE TO HELP ME AS YOU PROMISED TO DO YES OF COURSE SAID PAULA
2270-3547-0040 BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEGIN AND WHEN ONE HAS SERVED THE DEVIL AS MANY YEARS AS I HAVE
2270-3547-0041 AND I HAD ALMOST YIELDED WHEN SUDDENLY I CRIED TO THE LORD JESUS TO HELP ME AND THEN A WONDERFUL THING HAPPENED ALL DESIRE FOR THE DRINK WENT AWAY AND I'VE BEEN FREE EVER SINCE THEN TOO I HAD NO WORK AND MY WIFE TAUNTED ME WITH THAT
2270-3547-0042 AND I WANDERED UP AND DOWN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR SOMETHING TO DO UNFORTUNATELY EVERYBODY KNEW ME AND KNEW TOO MUCH ABOUT ME SO THERE WAS NO WORK FOR SUCH AS ME THEN SUDDENLY THE POOR THIN FACE WAS ILLUMINATED WITH A SMILE AS THE BRETON TRIUMPHANTLY SAID
2270-3547-0043 HOW GLAD I AM EXCLAIMED PAULA YES MADEMOISELLE BUT I HAVE YOU TO THANK FOR YOUR GREAT KINDNESS TO ME
2270-3547-0044 YOU MADEMOISELLE YOU MADE ME FEEL THAT YOU REALLY LOVED ME
2270-3547-0045 WHAT'S THAT IT'S A BOOK A PART OF THE BIBLE THAT TELLS US ABOUT THE LORD JESUS AND HOW HE SAVES US FROM THE GUILT AND POWER OF SIN AND HOW WE CAN SERVE HIM WELL MADEMOISELLE REPLIED THE BRETON IF IT'S A BOOK IT'S OF NO USE TO ME I DON'T KNOW HOW TO READ
2270-3547-0046 I MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO READ CONTINUED THE POOR FELLOW
2270-3547-0047 BUT I SCARCELY EVER ACTUALLY APPEARED IN THE SCHOOL ROOM THE STREETS IN THOSE DAYS WERE TOO ATTRACTIVE A PLAYGROUND
2270-3547-0048 AND THE BRETON SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY IT'S TOO LATE NOW TO GET ANYTHING OF THAT SORT IN THIS DULL HEAD
