25-88353-0000 CHAPTER FIVE THE PICTURE OF CROWD SPLENDOR
25-88353-0001 AND WHEN HE WILL GO TO THE PICTURE SHOW TO VERIFY IT THE SHODDIEST SILENT DRAMA MAY CONTAIN NOBLE VIEWS OF THE SEA THIS PART IS ALMOST SURE TO BE GOOD IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL RESOURCE
25-88353-0002 RAGGED GLOWERING STRIKERS AND GOSSIPING DICKERING PEOPLE IN THE MARKETPLACE ONLY GRIFFITH AND HIS CLOSE DISCIPLES CAN DO THESE AS WELL AS ALMOST ANY MANAGER CAN REPRODUCE THE OCEAN
25-88353-0003 YET THE SEA OF HUMANITY IS DRAMATICALLY BLOOD BROTHER TO THE PACIFIC ATLANTIC OR MEDITERRANEAN
25-88353-0004 TO BRING US THESE PANORAMIC DRAMA ELEMENTS BY THE LAW OF COMPENSATION WHILE THE MOTION PICTURE IS SHALLOW IN SHOWING PRIVATE PASSION IT IS POWERFUL IN CONVEYING THE PASSIONS OF MASSES OF MEN BERNARD SHAW
25-88353-0005 ANSWERED SEVERAL QUESTIONS IN REGARD TO THE PHOTOPLAY HERE ARE TWO BITS FROM HIS DISCOURSE STRIKE THE DIALOGUE FROM MOLIERE'S TARTUFFE AND WHAT AUDIENCE WOULD BEAR ITS MERE STAGE BUSINESS
25-88353-0006 WHAT BECOMES OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHAKESPEARE AND SHERIDAN KNOWLES IN THE FILM OR BETWEEN SHAKESPEARE'S LEAR AND ANY ONE ELSE'S LEAR NO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ALL THE INTEREST LIES IN THE NEW OPENING
25-88353-0007 FORMERLY DISABLED BY INCIDENTAL DEFICIENCIES OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER THAT DO NOT MATTER IN THE PICTURE THEATRE
25-88353-0008 WHO CAN WRITE NOVELS AND EPICS BUT CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF THEM WRITE PLAYS WELL THE FILM LENDS ITSELF ADMIRABLY TO THE SUCCESSION OF EVENTS PROPER TO NARRATIVE AND EPIC BUT PHYSICALLY
25-88353-0009 IMPRACTICABLE ON THE STAGE PARADISE LOST WOULD MAKE A FAR BETTER FILM THAN IBSEN'S JOHN GABRIEL BORKMAN THOUGH BORKMAN IS A DRAMATIC MASTERPIECE AND MILTON COULD NOT WRITE AN EFFECTIVE PLAY
25-88353-0010 NOTE IN ESPECIAL WHAT SHAW SAYS ABOUT NARRATIVE EPIC AND PARADISE LOST HE HAS IN MIND NO DOUBT THE POURING HOSTS OF DEMONS AND ANGELS THIS IS
25-88353-0011 ONE KIND OF A CROWD PICTURE
25-88353-0012 IMPERSONATES THE ITALIAN IN A FILM OF THAT TITLE BY THOMAS H INCE AND G GARDENER SULLIVAN THE FIRST PART TAKEN OSTENSIBLY IN VENICE DELINEATES THE FESTIVAL SPIRIT OF THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGES
25-88353-0013 AND IN GONDOLAS IT GIVES OUT THE ATMOSPHERE OF TOWN CROWD HAPPINESS
25-88353-0014 A MERRY GRAPE HARVEST THEN THE
25-88353-0015 TELLING GOOD BY TO THEIR KINDRED ON THE PIERS THEN THE DRAMA OF ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK THE WONDER OF THE STEERAGE PEOPLE POURING DOWN THEIR PROPER GANGWAY IS CONTRASTED WITH THE CONVENTIONAL
25-88353-0016 THEY BESIEGE THE FOUNTAIN END OF THE STREET SPRINKLING WAGON QUITE CLOSELY REJOICING TO HAVE THEIR CLOTHES SOAKED THEY GATHER ROUND THE FIRE PLUG THAT IS TURNED ON FOR THEIR BENEFIT AND AGAIN BECOME WET AS DROWNED RATS PASSING THROUGH THESE CROWDS
25-88353-0017 AND CLARA WILLIAMS AS THE ITALIAN AND HIS SWEETHEART THEY OWE THE FORCE OF THEIR ACTING TO THE FACT THAT THEY EXPRESS EACH MASS OF HUMANITY IN TURN THEIR CHILD IS BORN IT DOES NOT FLOURISH
25-88353-0018 IT REPRESENTS IN AN ACUTER WAY ANOTHER PHASE OF THE SAME CHILD STRUGGLE WITH THE HEAT THAT THE GAMINS INDICATE IN THEIR PURSUIT OF THE WATER CART THEN A DEEPER MATTER
25-88353-0019 DRAB EAST SIDE THE GONDOLIER BECOMES BOOT BLACK THE GRAPE GATHERING PEASANT GIRL BECOMES THE SUFFERING SLUM MOTHER THEY ARE NOT SPECIALIZED CHARACTERS LIKE PENDENNIS OR BECKY SHARP IN THE NOVELS OF THACKERAY
25-88353-0020 AN OLD GRIFFITH BIOGRAPH FIRST ISSUED IN NINETEEN ELEVEN BEFORE GRIFFITH'S NAME OR THAT OF ANY ACTOR IN FILMS WAS ADVERTISED BLANCHE SWEET IS THE LEADING LADY AND CHARLES H WEST THE LEADING MAN
25-88353-0021 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A BEVY OF VILLAGE LOVERS IS CONVEYED IN A LIVELY SWEET HEARTING DANCE THEN THE BOY AND HIS COMRADES GO FORTH TO WAR THE LINES PASS BETWEEN HAND WAVING CROWDS OF FRIENDS
25-88353-0022 THESE FRIENDS GIVE THE SENSE OF PATRIOTISM IN MASS THEN AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS FEELING AS THE SPECIAL AGENTS TO EXPRESS IT THE SOLDIERS ARE IN BATTLE BY THE FORTUNES OF WAR
25-88353-0023 THE ONSET IS UNEXPECTEDLY NEAR TO THE HOUSE WHERE ONCE WAS THE DANCE THE BOY IS AT FIRST A COWARD HE ENTERS THE OLD FAMILIAR DOOR HE APPEALS TO THE GIRL TO HIDE HIM
25-88353-0024 AND FOR THE TIME BREAKS HER HEART HE GOES FORTH A FUGITIVE NOT ONLY FROM BATTLE BUT FROM HER TERRIBLE GIRLISH ANGER BUT LATER HE RALLIES HE
25-88353-0025 BRINGS A TRAIN OF POWDER WAGONS THROUGH FIRES BUILT IN HIS PATH BY THE ENEMY'S SCOUTS HE LOSES EVERY ONE OF HIS MEN AND ALL BUT THE LAST WAGON WHICH HE DRIVES HIMSELF HIS RETURN WITH THAT AMMUNITION SAVES THE HARD FOUGHT DAY
25-88353-0026 GLIMPSES OF THE BATTLE ARE GIVEN WITH A SPLENDOR THAT ONLY GRIFFITH HAS ATTAINED BLANCHE SWEET
25-88353-0027 AND THE WHOLE BODY SOCIAL OF THE VILLAGE HOW THE COSTUMES FLASH AND THE HANDKERCHIEFS WAVE AROUND HER
25-88353-0028 ONLY THE GIRL KNOWS HE WAS FIRST A FAILURE THE WOUNDED GENERAL HONORS HIM AS THE HERO ABOVE ALL NOW SHE IS RADIANT SHE CANNOT HELP BUT BE TRIUMPHANT
25-88353-0029 THOUGH THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE IS BLOWN OUT BY A SHELL AND THE DYING ARE EVERYWHERE THIS ONE REEL WORK OF ART HAS BEEN REISSUED OF LATE BY THE BIOGRAPH COMPANY
25-88353-0030 IT SHOULD BE KEPT IN THE LIBRARIES OF THE UNIVERSITIES AS A STANDARD ONE REEL FILMS ARE UNFORTUNATE IN THIS SENSE THAT IN ORDER TO SEE A FAVORITE THE STUDENT MUST WAIT
25-88353-0031 THROUGH FIVE OTHER REELS OF A MIXED PROGRAMME THAT USUALLY IS BAD THAT IS THE REASON ONE REEL MASTERPIECES SELDOM APPEAR NOW THE PRODUCER IN A MOOD TO MAKE A SPECIAL EFFORT
25-88353-0032 OF TWENTY MINUTES EACH THESE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE THAT IF THEY PLEASE AT ALL ONE CAN SEE THEM AGAIN AT ONCE WITHOUT
25-88353-0033 I SHALL REITERATE THROUGHOUT THIS WORK THE NECESSITY FOR RESTRAINT A ONE HOUR PROGRAMME IS LONG ENOUGH FOR ANY ONE IF THE OBSERVER IS PLEASED HE WILL SIT IT THROUGH AGAIN AND TAKE ANOTHER HOUR
25-88353-0034 THERE IS NOT A GOOD FILM IN THE WORLD BUT IS THE BETTER FOR BEING SEEN IN IMMEDIATE SUCCESSION TO ITSELF SIX REEL PROGRAMMES ARE A WEARINESS TO THE FLESH THE BEST OF THE OLD ONE REEL BIOGRAPHS OF GRIFFITH
25-88353-0035 CONTAINED MORE IN TWENTY MINUTES THAN THESE AMBITIOUS INCONTINENT SIX REEL DISPLAYS GIVE US IN TWO HOURS
25-88353-0036 BUT IT IS GRIFFITH'S GREAT FILM THE BATTLE
25-88353-0037 TO CONTINUE THE CONTRAST BETWEEN PRIVATE PASSION IN THE THEATRE AND CROWD PASSION IN THE PHOTOPLAY LET US TURN TO SHAW AGAIN CONSIDER HIS ILLUSTRATION OF IAGO OTHELLO AND LEAR THESE PARTS AS HE IMPLIES
25-88353-0038 WOULD FALL FLAT IN MOTION PICTURES THE MINOR SITUATIONS OF DRAMATIC INTENSITY MIGHT IN MANY CASES BE BUILT UP THE CRISIS WOULD INEVITABLY FAIL IAGO AND OTHELLO AND LEAR
25-88353-0039 ARE ESSENTIALLY PRIVATE PERSONS INDIVIDUALS IN EXTREMIS IF YOU GO TO A MOTION PICTURE AND FEEL YOURSELF SUDDENLY GRIPPED BY THE HIGHEST DRAMATIC TENSION AS ON THE OLD STAGE AND REFLECT AFTERWARD THAT IT WAS A FIGHT BETWEEN ONLY
25-88353-0040 STOP TO ANALYZE WHAT THEY STOOD FOR
25-88353-0041 THAT HAD BEEN PURSUING EACH OTHER EARLIER IN THE FILM OTHERWISE THE CONFLICT HOWEVER VIOLENT APPEALED MAINLY TO THE SENSE OF SPEED SO
25-88353-0042 IN THE BIRTH OF A NATION WHICH COULD BETTER BE CALLED THE OVERTHROW OF NEGRO RULE THE KU KLUX KLAN DASHES DOWN THE ROAD AS POWERFULLY AS NIAGARA POURS OVER THE CLIFF FINALLY THE WHITE GIRL ELSIE STONEMAN
25-88353-0043 IMPERSONATED BY LILLIAN GISH IS RESCUED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN FROM THE MULATTO POLITICIAN SILAS LYNCH IMPERSONATED BY GEORGE SEIGMANN THE LADY IS BROUGHT FORWARD AS A TYPICAL HELPLESS WHITE MAIDEN
25-88353-0044 IMPERSONATED BY HENRY B WALTHALL ENTERS NOT AS AN INDIVIDUAL BUT AS REPRESENTING THE WHOLE ANGLO SAXON NIAGARA HE HAS THE MASK OF THE KU KLUX KLAN ON HIS FACE
25-88353-0045 TILL THE CRISIS HAS PASSED THE WRATH OF THE SOUTHERNER AGAINST THE BLACKS AND THEIR NORTHERN ORGANIZERS HAS BEEN PILED UP THROUGH MANY PREVIOUS SCENES
25-88353-0046 SOMETHING THE PHOTOPLAYS THAT TRACE STRICTLY PERSONAL HATREDS CANNOT ACHIEVE THE BIRTH OF A NATION IS A CROWD PICTURE IN A TRIPLE SENSE ON THE FILMS AS IN THE AUDIENCE
25-88353-0047 IT TURNS THE CROWD INTO A MOB THAT IS EITHER FOR OR AGAINST THE REVEREND THOMAS DIXON'S POISONOUS HATRED OF THE NEGRO GRIFFITH IS A CHAMELEON IN INTERPRETING HIS AUTHORS WHEREVER THE SCENARIO SHOWS TRACES OF THE CLANSMAN
25-88353-0048 THE ORIGINAL BOOK BY THOMAS DIXON IT IS BAD WHEREVER IT IS UNADULTERATED GRIFFITH WHICH IS HALF THE TIME IT IS GOOD THE REVEREND THOMAS DIXON IS A RATHER STAGY SIMON LEGREE IN HIS AVOWED VIEWS A
25-88353-0049 HYDROPHOBIA IN THE LATTER END OF UNCLE TOM'S CABIN UNCONSCIOUSLY MISTER DIXON HAS DONE HIS BEST TO PROVE THAT LEGREE WAS NOT A FICTITIOUS CHARACTER
25-88353-0050 I RECOMMEND THEIR WORKS TO HIM AS A BETTER BASIS FOR FUTURE SOUTHERN SCENARIOS THE BIRTH OF A NATION HAS BEEN VERY PROPERLY DENOUNCED FOR ITS SIMON LEGREE QUALITIES BY FRANCIS HACKETT JANE ADDAMS AND OTHERS
25-88353-0051 BUT IT IS STILL TRUE THAT IT IS A WONDER IN ITS GRIFFITH SECTIONS IN ITS HANDLING OF MASSES OF MEN IT FURTHER ILLUSTRATES THE PRINCIPLES THAT MADE NOTABLE THE OLD ONE REEL BATTLE FILM DESCRIBED IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS CHAPTER
25-88353-0052 THE BATTLE IN THE END IS GREATER BECAUSE OF ITS SELF POSSESSION AND CONCENTRATION ALL PACKED INTO TWENTY MINUTES WHEN IN THE BIRTH OF A NATION LINCOLN
25-88353-0053 GOES DOWN BEFORE THE ASSASSIN IT IS A MASTER SCENE HE FALLS AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND A THOUSAND HIGH AND NOBLE CROWD ASPIRATIONS THE MIMIC AUDIENCE IN THE RESTORED FORD'S THEATRE RISES IN PANIC
25-88353-0054 THIS CROWD IS INTERPRETED IN ESPECIAL FOR US
25-88353-0055 IN THE SEATS NEAREST AND THE FREEZING HORROR OF THE TREASON SWEEPS FROM THE FORD'S THEATRE AUDIENCE TO THE REAL AUDIENCE BEYOND THEM THE REAL CROWD TOUCHED WITH TERROR BEHOLDS ITS NATURAL FACE
25-88353-0056 IN THE GLASS LATER
25-88353-0057 MOBS SPLENDIDLY HANDLED TOSSING WILDLY AND RHYTHMICALLY LIKE THE SEA THEN IS DELINEATED THE RISE OF THE KU KLUX KLAN
25-88353-0058 THE BIRTH OF A NATION READ THE FOURTEENTH CHAPTER ENTITLED THE ORCHESTRA CONVERSATION AND THE CENSORSHIP
25-88353-0059 MOB MOVEMENTS OF ANGER AND JOY WILL GO THROUGH FANATICAL AND PROVINCIAL WHIRLWINDS INTO GREAT NATIONAL MOVEMENTS OF ANGER AND JOY A BOOK BY GERALD STANLEY LEE THAT HAS A SCORE OF FUTURE SCENARIOS IN IT A BOOK THAT MIGHT
25-88353-0060 WELL BE DIPPED INTO BY THE READER BEFORE HE GOES TO SUCH A PLAY AS THE ITALIAN OR THE BATTLE IS THE WORK WHICH BEARS THE TITLE OF THIS CHAPTER CROWDS
25-88353-0061 MISTER LEE IS FAR FROM INFALLIBLE IN HIS REMEDIES FOR FACTORY AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS BUT IN SENSITIVENESS TO THE FLOWING STREET OF HUMANITY HE IS INDEED A MAN
25-88353-0062 LISTEN TO THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE DIVISIONS OF HIS BOOK CROWDS AND MACHINES LETTING THE CROWDS BE GOOD LETTING THE CROWDS BE BEAUTIFUL CROWDS AND HEROES
25-88353-0063 WHERE ARE WE GOING THE CROWD SCARE THE STRIKE AN INVENTION FOR MAKING CROWDS THINK THE CROWD'S IMAGINATION ABOUT PEOPLE SPEAKING AS ONE OF THE CROWD
25-88353-0064 WILL BECOME SACRED IN EACH OTHER'S EYES IN PICTURES AND IN FACT A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS THEME ON OTHER PLANES
25-88353-0065 ARCHITECTURE IN MOTION AND THE FIFTEENTH CHAPTER
