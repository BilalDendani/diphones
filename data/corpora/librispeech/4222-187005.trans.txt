4222-187005-0000 THE LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY THE DAYS WENT BY WITH CHRIS'S MORNINGS AND AFTERNOONS SPENT IN MISTER WICKER'S STUDY READING BOOKS TOO HEAVY FOR HIM TO LIFT LEARNING INCANTATIONS BY HEART AND HOW TO BLEND SIMPLE FORMULAE OVER THE FIRE
4222-187005-0001 HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT MISTER WICKER THOUGH INTERESTED AND ATTENTIVE GAVE CHRIS THE IMPRESSION THAT WHAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD WAS NOT NEW TO HIM AT TIMES CHRIS WAS ALLOWED TO RUN ABOUT THE LARGE VEGETABLE GARDEN AND CLIMB THE ORCHARD TREES
4222-187005-0002 BUT HE WAS TOLD THAT THE MOMENT HAD NOT YET COME WHEN HE COULD WANDER AT WILL IN EARLY GEORGETOWN CHRIS HAD TRIED IT ONCE REBELLIOUS AND BORED AT THE NOW FAMILIAR GROUND BUT IT WAS AS IF AN INVISIBLE WALL KEPT HIM IN THE CONFINES OF MISTER WICKER'S LAND
4222-187005-0003 A SLIPPERY GLASS WALL HE COULD FEEL BUT NOT SEE AND IN WHICH HE COULD DISCOVER NO CHINK
4222-187005-0004 SO THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO DO BUT TO WORK AS FAST AND AS WELL AS HE COULD THERE ARE RUMORS MISTER WICKER HAD TOLD HIM QUIETLY TOO QUIETLY THAT CLAGGETT CHEW IS PREPARING HIS SHIP THE VENTURE
4222-187005-0005 FOR A VOYAGE EAST THERE IS MUCH ACTIVITY ABOUT HIS SHIP AND HE IS LAYING IN STORES SO I AM INFORMED WE MUST GET FORWARD WITH ALL HASTE FOR HIS SHIP IS A FAST ONE FASTER THAN THE MIRABELLE
4222-187005-0006 SHADOWED EYES AND WEARY AIR FOR CHRIS WAS NOW AS ACCEPTED A MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD AS MISTER WICKER HIMSELF AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE ROBUST GUFFAWS OF NED CILLEY AND THE MINISTRATIONS OF THE NOW DEVOTED BECKY
4222-187005-0007 NOW HOWEVER CHRIS WAS NOT THE BOY HE HAD BEEN A FEW WEEKS BEFORE HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE BOWL AND ADDRESSED THE FISH SIR HE SAID TO THE GOLDFISH I AM HERE WHAT SHALL I DO FIRST
4222-187005-0008 THE GOLDFISH MIGHT ALMOST HAVE BEEN SAID TO HAVE CHANGED ITS EXPRESSION AND SMILED BEFORE BRUSHING A DROP OF WATER FROM HIS SLEEVE MISTER WICKER STOOD BESIDE THE TABLE SMILING HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED
4222-187005-0009 IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY AND THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY ALL AT ONCE AT THE IMMINENT PROSPECT OF REALLY CHANGING HIMSELF INTO SOME OTHER FORM CHRIS BECAME FRIGHTENED AND HIS HANDS GREW COLD OH SIR
4222-187005-0010 YOU KNOW ENOUGH TO START AND I FEEL REASONABLY SURE THAT YOU WILL BE QUITE ABLE TO CHANGE BACK AGAIN IF YOU GET STUCK I CAN HELP YOU COME NOW HE SAID PUTTING OUT HIS HAND TO TOUCH CHRIS'S SHOULDER IN A REASSURING WAY HERE YOU GO REMEMBER
4222-187005-0011 MISTER WICKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER WICKER SAID START AT ONCE
4222-187005-0012 CHRIS WAS SO STARTLED AT HIS USUALLY GENTLE MASTER'S TONE THAT WITHOUT FURTHER THOUGHT OR EFFORT ON HIS PART HE BEGAN INTONING TO HIMSELF THE WORDS AND SOUNDS OF INCANTATION SEVENTY THREE BOOK ONE AS HE WENT ON
4222-187005-0013 CONCENTRATING ON BECOMING A GOLDFISH IN THE BOWL ON THE TABLE HE BECAME AWARE OF A HUMMING SENSATION IN HIS HEAD THIS GREW UNTIL IT SEEMED THAT ALL HIS BODY WAS FILLED WITH THE STRANGE NEW VIBRATION
4222-187005-0014 THE SENSATION SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS
4222-187005-0015 HE FELT BUOYANT AND RESTED AND LOOKED ABOUT ONLY TO GET A WAVERY ENLARGED GLIMPSE OF MISTER WICKER LOOKING MORE LIKE A REFLECTION IN A CIRCUS MIRROR THAN HIMSELF
4222-187005-0016 WITH A LIGHT TWIST OF HIS BODY CHRIS FLOATED OVER TO SEE THAT THE ROOM LOOKED THE SAME
4222-187005-0017 I'M A FISH CHRIS SAID AND HE HEARD THE WORDS MUFFLED AS THEY CAME BACK TO HIM THROUGH THE WATER OF HIS BOWL WELL WHAT DO YOU KNOW HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE
4222-187005-0018 AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED CLOSE BY BETTER COME BACK NOW TAKE IT SLOWLY SON
4222-187005-0019 SEVENTY FOUR BOOK ONE THE RETURN THE SAME STRANGE SENSATIONS FLOODED CHRIS AS HE MADE THE CHANGE BACK TO HIS OWN SHAPE BUT WHEN HE STOOD ONCE MORE ON HIS OWN TWO FEET ON THE CARPET IN MISTER WICKER'S STUDY
4222-187005-0020 HE WAS PLEASED AND HAPPY DESPITE HIS WEAKNESS MISTER WICKER TOOK HOLD OF HIS ARM AND HELPED HIM TO A CHAIR AND TAKING A SMALL VIAL FROM THE CUPBOARD AT THE END OF THE ROOM HE DROPPED A PELLET INTO IT AND HANDED IT TO CHRIS THIS WILL SEEM TO SMOKE SNIFF THE SMOKE
4222-187005-0021 LEAVING HIM QUIETED AND AS STRONG AS USUAL THERE NOW MISTER WICKER SAID RUBBING HIS HANDS WITH IMMENSE SATISFACTION THAT WAS NOT SO BAD WAS IT A PECULIAR FEELING BUT AS YOU COME TO DO IT MORE OFTEN AND MORE QUICKLY
4222-187005-0022 THE CHANGE WILL COME MORE RAPIDLY AND IN TIME YOU WILL BE SCARCELY AWARE OF THE SENSATIONS AT ALL HE LOOKED AT HIS PUPIL WITH PRIDE YOU WILL DO FAMOUSLY MY BOY IN ANOTHER MOMENT WHEN YOU HAVE RESTED WE SHALL TRY ANOTHER ONE
4222-187005-0023 FROM THAT TIME CHRIS BECAME INCREASINGLY PROFICIENT AND AS HIS ABILITY GREW HE BEGAN TO FIND MAGIC A WONDERFUL GAME WHICH HE AND MISTER WICKER PLAYED TOGETHER THEY PLAYED THIS NEW AND UNIQUE FORM OF HIDE AND SEEK
4222-187005-0024 EACH ONE TAKING A NEW SHAPE TURN BY TURN AS A CHALLENGE TO THE OTHER'S POWERS OF IMAGINATION AND DETECTION SOON CHRIS COULD TURN HIMSELF INTO A LIMITED NUMBER OF THINGS FOR EVEN MISTER WICKER'S MAGIC HAD A LIMIT
4222-187005-0025 A SINGING BIRD IN A CAGE A PART OF THE PATTERN IN THE BROCADED CURTAINS OR A SECTION OF THE DESIGN IN THE INDIAN RUG THE BLUEBOTTLE FLY OR THE GOLDFISH BECAME AS EASY AS SAYING EUREKA AND ON ONE OCCASION
4222-187005-0026 CHRIS TURNED HIMSELF INTO THE CHAIR ON WHICH MISTER WICKER WAS SITTING AND THEN WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM ON HIS FOUR WOODEN LEGS CARRYING MISTER WICKER WHO LAUGHED MORE HEARTILY THAN HE HAD IN YEARS AT THIS DISPLAY ON THE PART OF HIS STUDENT ONE DAY CHRIS WANDERED ALONE INTO THE DUSTY SHOP
4222-187005-0027 THIS AFTERNOON A RAINY ONE
4222-187005-0028 AND KICKED AN OLD PIECE OF WOOD AHEAD OF HIM INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE SHOP
4222-187005-0029 GOING UP TO THE SHOP WINDOW HE STOOD WITH HIS HANDS THRUST INTO HIS POCKETS STARING GLUMLY FIRST OUT THE WINDOW AND THEN IDLY AT THE THREE OBJECTS HE HAD ONCE LOVED TO CONTEMPLATE THE MIRABELLE IN HER BOTTLE THE COIL OF HEAVY ROPE
4222-187005-0030 AND THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE OF THE NUBIAN BOY WITHOUT INTEREST AT FIRST CHRIS STARED AT THE LITTLE NEGRO BOY SO GAILY DRESSED IN FULL RED TROUSERS GILDED JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN THE FIGURE'S SHOES
4222-187005-0031 CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE HAD CURVED UP POINTING TOES THEN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO CHRIS IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE
4222-187005-0032 THE PROSPECT EXCITED HIM WILDLY FOR HE HAD NO COMPANION WITH WHOM TO LAUGH AND SHARE JOKES GROWN PEOPLE HOWEVER GAY AND KIND WERE NEVER QUITE THE SAME
4222-187005-0033 HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINING THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION BUT HOW DID ONE CHANGE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE
4222-187005-0034 CHRIS GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WICKER'S DOOR HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY
4222-187005-0035 AND BOUND IN HEAVY BRASS STUDDED WITH SEMI PRECIOUS STONES IN THE FORM OF SIGNS AND SYMBOLS WITH DIFFICULTY STANDING ON TIPTOE CHRIS LIFTED IT DOWN AND PLACING IT ON THE FLOOR TURNED OVER PAGE AFTER PAGE
4222-187005-0036 THE AFTERNOON RAINY BEFORE INCREASED IN STORM DUSK CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARLED IN THE SKY AT LAST CHRIS FOUND IT THERE WERE THE WORDS AND THERE THE CHARM
4222-187005-0037 CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURED AT THE PROPER TIME HE HURRIED MEMORIZING AS HE CLOSED THE BOOK AND HOISTED IT ONCE MORE TO ITS HIGH SHELF LOOKING ABOUT HE FOUND THE INGREDIENTS THAT HAD BEEN LISTED
4222-187005-0038 AND IN AN EMPTY VIAL POURED FIRST TWO DROPS OF THIS AND THEN SEVENTEEN OF THAT AND RAN TO HEAT IT AT THE FIRE MISTER WICKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOORBOARDS CREAKED
4222-187005-0039 AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE POTION FUMED AND GLOWED AFTER WHAT SEEMED AN ENDLESS TIME AMID A GROWING GRIND OF THUNDER
4222-187005-0040 CHRIS HIS CHEEKS HOT FROM EXCITEMENT AND THE FIRE TIPTOED OUT JUST AS MISTER WICKER'S STEP CREAKED ON THE TOPMOST TREAD OF THE SPIRAL STAIR WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM
4222-187005-0041 AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY THE WORDS CAME OUT INTERRUPTED BY PEALS AND CRACKS OF THUNDER THE SHOP WAS BLACK EXCEPT FOR THE PALER CRESCENT OF THE BOW WINDOW GIVING ONTO THE STREET
4222-187005-0042 WITH A CRASH OF THUNDER ALL BUT DROWNING OUT HIS WORDS THE BOY SHOUTED IN THE EMPTINESS OF THE SHOP AS HE POURED THE ROSY LIQUID ON THE FIGURE MADE OF WOOD
4222-187005-0043 WHICH SPLINTERED ON THE FLOOR WATCHING THERE IN THE DARKNESS HE SHOOK SO WITH NERVES THAT HE HAD TO KNEEL FOR IN THE BLACKNESS LIT ONLY BY THE LIGHTNING AND ITS OWN EERIE GLOW THE WOOD WAS CHANGING AS HE WATCHED IT WAS AS IF THE STIFFNESS MELTED
4222-187005-0044 EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED AND LET THE BOUQUET FALL
4222-187005-0045 OUTSIDE THE RAIN POURED DOWN AS IF OVER SOME SKYWARD DAM THE BOY LOOKED DOWN AT CHRIS WITH A RADIANT SMILE AND PUT OUT HIS HAND I'LL HELP YOU UP HE SAID TO THE KNEELING BOY IN FRONT OF HIM I AM AMOS
