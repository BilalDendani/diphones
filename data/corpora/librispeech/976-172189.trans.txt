976-172189-0009 AND WHAT WAS WORSE THAT ALL THE WORLD WOULD CONSIDER THAT IT WAS THROUGH HIS FAULT AND ILL LUCK THEN ELPHIN ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS WHETHER MAN OR SPIRIT AND HE SUNG THUS

976-172189-0016 AND THERE ABODE TALIESIN UNTIL HE WAS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD WHEN ELPHIN SON OF GWYDDNO WENT BY A CHRISTMAS INVITATION TO HIS UNCLE MAELGAN GWYNEDD WHO HELD OPEN COURT AT CHRISTMAS TIDE IN THE CASTLE OF DYGANWY
976-172189-0017 FOR ALL THE NUMBER OF HIS LORDS OF BOTH DEGREES BOTH SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL WITH A VAST AND THRONGED HOST OF KNIGHTS AND SQUIRES AND ONE AROSE AND SAID IS THERE IN THE WHOLE WORLD A KING SO GREAT AS MAELGAN
976-172189-0018 OR ONE ON WHOM HEAVEN HAS BESTOWED SO MANY GIFTS AS UPON HIM FORM AND BEAUTY AND MEEKNESS AND STRENGTH BESIDES ALL THE POWERS OF THE SOUL AND TOGETHER WITH THESE THEY SAID THAT HEAVEN HAD GIVEN ONE GIFT THAT EXCEEDED ALL THE OTHERS
976-172189-0019 AND MODESTY OF HIS QUEEN WHOSE VIRTUES SURPASSED THOSE OF ALL THE LADIES AND NOBLE MAIDENS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE KINGDOM
976-172189-0020 WHO HAD BRAVER MEN WHO HAD FAIRER OR SWIFTER HORSES OR GREYHOUNDS WHO HAD MORE SKILFUL OR WISER BARDS THAN MAELGAN
976-172189-0021 UNTIL HE MIGHT SHOW THE TRUTH AS TO THE VIRTUES OF HIS WIFE AND THE WISDOM OF HIS BARD NOW WHEN ELPHIN HAD BEEN PUT IN A TOWER OF THE CASTLE WITH A THICK CHAIN ABOUT HIS FEET
976-172189-0022 IT IS SAID THAT IT WAS A SILVER CHAIN BECAUSE HE WAS OF ROYAL BLOOD THE KING AS THE STORY RELATES
976-172189-0023 TO INQUIRE INTO THE DEMEANOR OF ELPHIN'S WIFE
976-172189-0024 BEING FULLY MINDED TO BRING DISGRACE UPON HIS WIFE TALIESIN TOLD HIS MISTRESS HOW THAT THE KING HAD PLACED HIS MASTER IN DURANCE IN PRISON AND HOW THAT RHUN WAS COMING IN HASTE TO STRIVE TO BRING DISGRACE UPON HER
976-172189-0025 WHEREFORE HE CAUSED HIS MISTRESS
976-172189-0026 IN HER APPAREL WHICH THE NOBLE LADY GLADLY DID AND SHE LOADED HER HANDS WITH THE BEST RINGS THAT SHE AND HER HUSBAND POSSESSED IN THIS GUISE TALIESIN CAUSED HIS MISTRESS TO PUT THE MAIDEN TO SIT AT THE BOARD IN HER ROOM AT SUPPER
976-172189-0027 AND HE MADE HER TO SEEM AS HER MISTRESS AND THE MISTRESS TO SEEM AS THE MAID AND WHEN THEY WERE IN DUE TIME SEATED AT THEIR SUPPER IN THE MANNER THAT HAS BEEN SAID
976-172189-0028 AND WAS RECEIVED WITH JOY FOR THE SERVANTS KNEW HIM AND THEY BROUGHT HIM TO THE ROOM OF THEIR MISTRESS IN THE SEMBLANCE OF WHOM THE MAID ROSE UP FROM SUPPER AND WELCOMED HIM GLADLY AND AFTERWARDS SHE SAT DOWN TO SUPPER AGAIN AND RHUN WITH HER
976-172189-0029 WHO STILL KEPT THE SEMBLANCE OF HER MISTRESS AND VERILY THIS STORY SHOWS THAT THE MAIDEN BECAME SO INTOXICATED THAT SHE FELL ASLEEP AND THE STORY RELATES THAT IT WAS A POWDER THAT RHUN PUT INTO THE DRINK THAT MADE HER SLEEP SO SOUNDLY
976-172189-0030 THAT SHE NEVER FELT IT WHEN HE CUT OFF FROM HER HAND HER LITTLE FINGER WHEREON WAS THE SIGNET RING OF ELPHIN WHICH HE HAD SENT TO HIS WIFE AS A TOKEN A SHORT TIME BEFORE
976-172189-0031 AND THE RING AS A PROOF
976-172189-0032 WITHOUT HER AWAKING FROM HER SLEEP OF INTEMPERANCE THE KING REJOICED GREATLY AT THESE TIDINGS AND HE SENT FOR HIS COUNCILLORS TO WHOM HE TOLD THE WHOLE STORY FROM THE BEGINNING AND HE CAUSED ELPHIN TO BE BROUGHT OUT OF PRISON
976-172189-0033 AND HE CHIDED HIM BECAUSE OF HIS BOAST AND HE SPAKE ON THIS WISE ELPHIN BE IT KNOWN TO THEE BEYOND A DOUBT THAT IT IS BUT FOLLY FOR A MAN TO TRUST IN THE VIRTUES OF HIS WIFE FURTHER THAN HE CAN SEE HER
976-172189-0034 AND THAT THOU MAYEST BE CERTAIN OF THY WIFE'S VILENESS BEHOLD HER FINGER WITH THY SIGNET RING UPON IT WHICH WAS CUT FROM HER HAND LAST NIGHT WHILE SHE SLEPT THE SLEEP OF INTOXICATION THEN THUS SPAKE ELPHIN
976-172189-0035 WITH THY LEAVE MIGHTY KING I CANNOT DENY MY RING FOR IT IS KNOWN OF MANY BUT VERILY I ASSERT THAT THE FINGER AROUND WHICH IT IS WAS NEVER ATTACHED TO THE HAND OF MY WIFE FOR IN TRUTH AND CERTAINTY
976-172189-0036 WHENCE THIS WAS CUT THE SECOND THING IS THAT MY WIFE HAS NEVER LET PASS ONE SATURDAY SINCE I HAVE KNOWN HER WITHOUT PARING HER NAILS BEFORE GOING TO BED AND YOU CAN SEE FULLY THAT THE NAIL OF THIS LITTLE FINGER HAS NOT BEEN PARED FOR A MONTH
976-172189-0037 THE THIRD IS TRULY THAT THE HAND WHENCE THIS FINGER CAME WAS KNEADING RYE DOUGH WITHIN THREE DAYS BEFORE THE FINGER WAS CUT THEREFROM AND I CAN ASSURE YOUR HIGHNESS THAT MY WIFE HAS NEVER KNEADED RYE DOUGH SINCE MY WIFE SHE HAS BEEN
976-172189-0038 BUT HE BADE HER BE GLAD FOR THAT HE WOULD GO TO MAELGAN'S COURT TO FREE HIS MASTER SO HE TOOK LEAVE OF HIS MISTRESS AND CAME TO THE COURT OF MAELGAN
976-172189-0039 AT THE MOMENT WHEN THEY PASSED BY THE CORNER WHEREIN HE WAS CROUCHING TALIESIN POUTED OUT HIS LIPS AFTER THEM AND PLAYED BLERWM BLERWM WITH HIS FINGER UPON HIS LIPS NEITHER TOOK THEY MUCH NOTICE OF HIM AS THEY WENT BY
976-172189-0040 AS THEY HAD SEEN THE BOY DO THIS SIGHT CAUSED THE KING TO WONDER AND TO DEEM WITHIN HIMSELF THAT THEY WERE DRUNK WITH MANY LIQUORS WHEREFORE HE COMMANDED ONE OF HIS LORDS WHO SERVED AT THE BOARD TO GO TO THEM
976-172189-0041 AND DESIRE THEM TO COLLECT THEIR WITS AND TO CONSIDER WHERE THEY STOOD AND WHAT IT WAS FITTING FOR THEM TO DO AND THIS LORD DID SO GLADLY BUT THEY CEASED NOT FROM THEIR FOLLY ANY MORE THAN BEFORE
976-172189-0042 WHEREUPON HE SENT TO THEM A SECOND TIME AND A THIRD DESIRING THEM TO GO FORTH FROM THE HALL AT THE LAST THE KING ORDERED ONE OF HIS SQUIRES TO GIVE A BLOW TO THE CHIEF OF THEM NAMED HEININ VARDD AND THE SQUIRE TOOK A BROOM
976-172189-0043 AND STRUCK HIM ON THE HEAD SO THAT HE FELL BACK IN HIS SEAT THEN HE AROSE AND WENT ON HIS KNEES AND BESOUGHT LEAVE OF THE KING'S GRACE TO SHOW THAT THIS THEIR FAULT WAS NOT THROUGH WANT OF KNOWLEDGE NEITHER THROUGH DRUNKENNESS
976-172189-0044 BUT BY THE INFLUENCE OF SOME SPIRIT THAT WAS IN THE HALL AND HE SPOKE ON THIS WISE O HONORABLE KING
976-172189-0045 THAT NOT FROM THE STRENGTH OF DRINK OR OF TOO MUCH LIQUOR ARE WE DUMB
976-172189-0046 IN THE FORM OF A CHILD FORTHWITH THE KING COMMANDED THE SQUIRE TO FETCH HIM AND HE WENT TO THE NOOK WHERE TALIESIN SAT AND BROUGHT HIM BEFORE THE KING WHO ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS AND WHENCE HE CAME AND HE ANSWERED THE KING IN VERSE
976-172189-0047 PRIMARY CHIEF BARD AM I TO ELPHIN AND MY NATIVE COUNTRY IS THE REGION OF THE SUMMER STARS I HAVE BEEN IN ASIA WITH NOAH IN THE ARK I HAVE SEEN THE DESTRUCTION OF SODOM AND GOMORRAH
976-172189-0048 I WAS IN INDIA WHEN ROME WAS BUILT I HAVE NOW COME HERE TO THE REMNANT OF TROIA WHEN THE KING AND HIS NOBLES HAD HEARD THE SONG THEY WONDERED MUCH FOR THEY HAD NEVER HEARD THE LIKE FROM A BOY SO YOUNG AS HE
976-172189-0049 AND WHEN THE KING KNEW THAT HE WAS THE BARD OF ELPHIN
976-172189-0050 HIS FIRST AND WISEST BARD TO ANSWER TALIESIN AND TO STRIVE WITH HIM BUT WHEN HE CAME HE COULD DO NO OTHER THAN PLAY BLERWM ON HIS LIPS AND WHEN HE SENT FOR THE OTHERS OF THE FOUR AND TWENTY BARDS THEY ALL DID LIKEWISE AND COULD DO NO OTHER
976-172189-0051 AND MAELGAN ASKED THE BOY TALIESIN WHAT WAS HIS ERRAND AND HE ANSWERED HIM IN SONG ELPHIN THE SON OF GWYDDNO IS IN THE LAND OF ARTRO SECURED BY THIRTEEN LOCKS FOR PRAISING HIS INSTRUCTOR
976-172189-0052 THEREFORE I TALIESIN CHIEF OF THE BARDS OF THE WEST WILL LOOSEN ELPHIN OUT OF A GOLDEN FETTER THEN HE SANG TO THEM A RIDDLE DISCOVER THOU WHAT IS THE STRONG CREATURE FROM BEFORE THE FLOOD
976-172189-0053 WITHOUT FLESH WITHOUT BONE WITHOUT VEIN WITHOUT BLOOD WITHOUT HEAD WITHOUT FEET IT WILL NEITHER BE OLDER NOR YOUNGER THAN AT THE BEGINNING BEHOLD HOW THE SEA WHITENS WHEN FIRST IT COMES WHEN IT COMES FROM THE SOUTH
976-172189-0054 WHEN IT STRIKES ON COASTS IT IS IN THE FIELD IT IS IN THE WOOD BUT THE EYE CANNOT PERCEIVE IT ONE BEING HAS PREPARED IT BY A TREMENDOUS BLAST TO WREAK VENGEANCE ON
976-172189-0055 WHILE HE WAS THUS SINGING HIS VERSE THERE AROSE A MIGHTY STORM OF WIND SO THAT THE KING AND ALL HIS NOBLES THOUGHT THAT THE CASTLE WOULD FALL UPON THEIR HEADS AND THE KING CAUSED THEM TO FETCH ELPHIN IN HASTE FROM HIS DUNGEON AND PLACED HIM BEFORE TALIESIN
976-172189-0056 AND IT IS SAID THAT IMMEDIATELY HE SUNG A VERSE SO THAT THE CHAINS OPENED FROM ABOUT HIS FEET AFTER THAT TALIESIN BROUGHT ELPHIN'S WIFE BEFORE THEM AND SHOWED THAT SHE HAD NOT ONE FINGER WANTING AND IN THIS MANNER
