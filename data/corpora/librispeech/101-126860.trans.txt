101-126860-0001 POLYNESIA THEN SLIPPED OUT AT THE BACK OF THE TREE AND FLEW ACROSS TO THE PRISON SHE FOUND GUB GUB POKING HIS NOSE THROUGH THE BARS OF THE WINDOW
101-126860-0002 TRYING TO SNIFF THE COOKING SMELLS THAT CAME FROM THE PALACE KITCHEN SHE TOLD THE PIG TO BRING THE DOCTOR TO THE WINDOW BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO SPEAK TO HIM SO GUB GUB WENT AND WOKE THE DOCTOR
101-126860-0003 WHO WAS TAKING A NAP LISTEN WHISPERED THE PARROT WHEN JOHN DOLITTLE'S FACE APPEARED PRINCE BUMPO IS COMING HERE TO NIGHT TO SEE YOU
101-126860-0004 TO TURN HIM WHITE BUT BE SURE TO MAKE HIM PROMISE YOU FIRST THAT HE WILL OPEN THE PRISON DOOR AND FIND A SHIP FOR YOU TO CROSS THE SEA IN THIS IS ALL VERY WELL SAID THE DOCTOR
101-126860-0005 BUT IT ISN'T SO EASY TO TURN A BLACK MAN WHITE YOU SPEAK AS THOUGH HE WERE A DRESS TO BE RE DYED IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE SHALL THE LEOPARD CHANGE HIS SPOTS OR THE ETHIOPIAN HIS SKIN
101-126860-0006 YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT SAID POLYNESIA IMPATIENTLY BUT YOU MUST
101-126860-0007 YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF MEDICINES LEFT IN THE BAG HE'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU IF YOU CHANGE HIS COLOR IT IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE TO GET OUT OF PRISON WELL
101-126860-0008 I SUPPOSE IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE SAID THE DOCTOR LET ME SEE AND HE WENT OVER TO HIS MEDICINE BAG MURMURING SOMETHING ABOUT LIBERATED CHLORINE ON ANIMAL PIGMENT
101-126860-0009 SPREAD THICK WELL THAT NIGHT PRINCE BUMPO CAME SECRETLY TO THE DOCTOR IN PRISON AND SAID TO HIM WHITE MAN I AM AN UNHAPPY PRINCE YEARS AGO
101-126860-0010 I WENT IN SEARCH OF THE SLEEPING BEAUTY WHOM I HAD READ OF IN A BOOK AND HAVING TRAVELED THROUGH THE WORLD MANY DAYS I AT LAST FOUND HER
101-126860-0011 TO AWAKEN HER AS THE BOOK SAID I SHOULD TIS TRUE INDEED THAT SHE AWOKE BUT WHEN SHE SAW MY FACE SHE CRIED OUT OH HE'S BLACK AND SHE RAN AWAY AND WOULDN'T MARRY ME
101-126860-0012 BUT WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN SOMEWHERE ELSE SO I CAME BACK FULL OF SADNESS TO MY FATHER'S KINGDOM
101-126860-0013 SO I COME TO YOU FOR HELP IF YOU WILL TURN ME WHITE SO THAT I MAY GO BACK TO THE SLEEPING BEAUTY I WILL GIVE YOU HALF MY KINGDOM AND ANYTHING BESIDES YOU ASK PRINCE BUMPO
101-126860-0014 SAID THE DOCTOR LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY AT THE BOTTLES IN HIS MEDICINE BAG SUPPOSING I MADE YOUR HAIR A NICE BLONDE COLOR WOULD NOT THAT DO INSTEAD TO MAKE YOU HAPPY NO SAID BUMPO
101-126860-0015 I MUST BE A WHITE PRINCE YOU KNOW IT IS VERY HARD TO CHANGE THE COLOR OF A PRINCE SAID THE DOCTOR ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS A MAGICIAN CAN DO
101-126860-0016 SAID THE DOCTOR QUICKLY WELL I WILL DO WHAT I CAN FOR YOU YOU WILL HAVE TO BE VERY PATIENT THOUGH YOU KNOW WITH SOME MEDICINES YOU CAN NEVER BE VERY SURE I MIGHT HAVE TO TRY TWO OR THREE TIMES
101-126860-0017 WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT NOW COME OVER HERE BY THE LIGHT OH BUT BEFORE I DO ANYTHING YOU MUST FIRST GO DOWN TO THE BEACH AND GET A SHIP READY WITH FOOD IN IT TO TAKE ME ACROSS THE SEA
101-126860-0018 DO NOT SPEAK A WORD OF THIS TO ANY ONE AND WHEN I HAVE DONE AS YOU ASK YOU MUST LET ME AND ALL MY ANIMALS OUT OF PRISON PROMISE BY THE CROWN OF JOLLIGINKI
101-126860-0019 SO THE PRINCE PROMISED AND WENT AWAY TO GET A SHIP READY AT THE SEASHORE WHEN HE CAME BACK AND SAID THAT IT WAS DONE THE DOCTOR ASKED DAB DAB
101-126860-0020 TO BRING A BASIN THEN HE MIXED A LOT OF MEDICINES IN THE BASIN AND TOLD BUMPO TO DIP HIS FACE IN IT THE PRINCE LEANED DOWN AND PUT HIS FACE IN
101-126860-0021 RIGHT UP TO THE EARS HE HELD IT THERE A LONG TIME SO LONG THAT THE DOCTOR SEEMED TO GET DREADFULLY ANXIOUS AND FIDGETY STANDING FIRST ON ONE LEG AND THEN ON THE OTHER
101-126860-0022 LOOKING AT ALL THE BOTTLES HE HAD USED FOR THE MIXTURE AND READING THE LABELS ON THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN A STRONG SMELL FILLED THE PRISON LIKE THE SMELL OF BROWN PAPER BURNING AT LAST
101-126860-0023 THE PRINCE LIFTED HIS FACE UP OUT OF THE BASIN BREATHING VERY HARD AND ALL THE ANIMALS CRIED OUT IN SURPRISE FOR THE PRINCE'S FACE HAD TURNED AS WHITE AS SNOW
101-126860-0024 BUT THE DOCTOR ASKED HIM NOT TO MAKE SO MUCH NOISE ABOUT IT AND WHEN HE HAD CLOSED HIS MEDICINE BAG IN A HURRY HE TOLD HIM TO OPEN THE PRISON DOOR
101-126860-0025 BUMPO BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT KEEP THE LOOKING GLASS AS IT WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE KINGDOM OF JOLLIGINKI AND HE WANTED TO LOOK AT HIMSELF ALL DAY LONG BUT THE DOCTOR SAID
101-126860-0026 HE NEEDED IT TO SHAVE WITH THEN THE PRINCE TAKING A BUNCH OF COPPER KEYS FROM HIS POCKET UNDID THE GREAT DOUBLE LOCKS AND THE DOCTOR WITH ALL HIS ANIMALS
101-126860-0027 RAN AS FAST AS THEY COULD DOWN TO THE SEASHORE WHILE BUMPO LEANED AGAINST THE WALL OF THE EMPTY DUNGEON SMILING AFTER THEM HAPPILY HIS BIG FACE SHINING LIKE POLISHED IVORY IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
101-126860-0028 WHEN THEY CAME TO THE BEACH THEY SAW POLYNESIA AND CHEE CHEE WAITING FOR THEM ON THE ROCKS NEAR THE SHIP I FEEL SORRY ABOUT BUMPO SAID THE DOCTOR
101-126860-0029 MOST LIKELY HE WILL BE AS BLACK AS EVER WHEN HE WAKES UP IN THE MORNING THAT'S ONE REASON WHY I DIDN'T LIKE TO LEAVE THE MIRROR WITH HIM BUT THEN AGAIN HE MIGHT STAY WHITE I HAD NEVER USED THAT MIXTURE BEFORE
101-126860-0030 TO TELL THE TRUTH I WAS SURPRISED MYSELF THAT IT WORKED SO WELL BUT I HAD TO DO SOMETHING DIDN'T I I COULDN'T POSSIBLY SCRUB THE KING'S KITCHEN FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE IT WAS SUCH A DIRTY KITCHEN
101-126860-0031 HIS FATHER WHO HAD US LOCKED UP IT WASN'T BUMPO'S FAULT I WONDER IF I OUGHT TO GO BACK AND APOLOGIZE OH WELL
101-126860-0032 AND WHO KNOWS HE MAY STAY WHITE AFTER ALL THE SLEEPING BEAUTY WOULD NEVER HAVE HIM EVEN IF HE DID SAID DAB DAB HE LOOKED BETTER THE WAY HE WAS I THOUGHT BUT HE'D NEVER BE ANYTHING BUT UGLY
101-126860-0033 NO MATTER WHAT COLOR HE WAS MADE STILL HE HAD A GOOD HEART SAID THE DOCTOR ROMANTIC OF COURSE BUT A GOOD HEART AFTER ALL HANDSOME IS AS HANDSOME DOES
101-126860-0034 I DON'T BELIEVE THE POOR BOOBY FOUND THE SLEEPING BEAUTY AT ALL SAID JIP THE DOG MOST LIKELY HE KISSED SOME FARMER'S FAT WIFE WHO WAS TAKING A SNOOZE UNDER AN APPLE TREE
101-126860-0035 CAN'T BLAME HER FOR GETTING SCARED I WONDER WHO HE'LL GO AND KISS THIS TIME SILLY BUSINESS THEN THE PUSHMI PULLYU THE WHITE MOUSE GUB GUB DAB DAB
101-126860-0036 JIP AND THE OWL TOO TOO WENT ON TO THE SHIP WITH THE DOCTOR BUT CHEE CHEE POLYNESIA AND THE CROCODILE STAYED BEHIND BECAUSE AFRICA WAS THEIR PROPER HOME
101-126860-0037 THE LAND WHERE THEY WERE BORN AND WHEN THE DOCTOR STOOD UPON THE BOAT HE LOOKED OVER THE SIDE ACROSS THE WATER AND THEN HE REMEMBERED
101-126860-0038 THE WIDE WIDE SEA LOOKED TERRIBLY BIG AND LONESOME IN THE MOONLIGHT AND HE BEGAN TO WONDER IF THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR WAY WHEN THEY PASSED OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND
101-126860-0039 BUT EVEN WHILE HE WAS WONDERING THEY HEARD A STRANGE WHISPERING NOISE HIGH IN THE AIR COMING THROUGH THE NIGHT AND THE ANIMALS ALL STOPPED SAYING GOOD BY AND LISTENED
101-126860-0040 THE NOISE GREW LOUDER AND BIGGER IT SEEMED TO BE COMING NEARER TO THEM A SOUND LIKE THE AUTUMN WIND BLOWING THROUGH THE LEAVES OF A POPLAR TREE OR A GREAT
101-126860-0041 THEY ALL LOOKED UP AND THERE STREAMING ACROSS THE FACE OF THE MOON
101-126860-0042 THAT FOR A LITTLE THEY COVERED THE WHOLE MOON SO IT COULD NOT SHINE AND THE SEA GREW DARK AND BLACK LIKE WHEN A STORM CLOUD PASSES OVER THE SUN
101-126860-0043 AND PRESENTLY ALL THESE BIRDS CAME DOWN CLOSE SKIMMING OVER THE WATER AND THE LAND AND THE NIGHT SKY WAS LEFT CLEAR ABOVE AND THE MOON SHONE AS BEFORE
101-126860-0044 NO SOUND BUT THIS GREAT RUSTLING OF FEATHERS WHICH GREW GREATER NOW THAN EVER WHEN THEY BEGAN TO SETTLE ON THE SANDS ALONG THE ROPES OF THE SHIP
101-126860-0045 ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE EXCEPT THE TREES THE DOCTOR COULD SEE THAT THEY HAD BLUE WINGS AND WHITE BREASTS AND VERY SHORT FEATHERED LEGS
101-126860-0046 AS SOON AS THEY HAD ALL FOUND A PLACE TO SIT SUDDENLY THERE WAS NO NOISE LEFT ANYWHERE ALL WAS QUIET ALL WAS STILL AND IN THE SILENT MOONLIGHT
101-126860-0047 I HAD NO IDEA THAT WE HAD BEEN IN AFRICA SO LONG IT WILL BE NEARLY SUMMER WHEN WE GET HOME FOR THESE ARE THE SWALLOWS GOING BACK SWALLOWS I THANK YOU FOR WAITING FOR US
101-126860-0048 IT IS VERY THOUGHTFUL OF YOU NOW WE NEED NOT BE AFRAID THAT WE WILL LOSE OUR WAY UPON THE SEA PULL UP THE ANCHOR AND SET THE SAIL WHEN THE SHIP MOVED OUT UPON THE WATER
101-126860-0049 THOSE WHO STAYED BEHIND CHEE CHEE POLYNESIA AND THE CROCODILE GREW TERRIBLY SAD FOR NEVER IN THEIR LIVES HAD THEY KNOWN ANY ONE THEY LIKED SO WELL AS DOCTOR JOHN DOLITTLE
101-126860-0050 THEY STILL STOOD THERE UPON THE ROCKS
