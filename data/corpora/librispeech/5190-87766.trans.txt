5190-87766-0000 LOOKING ABOUT HIM HE SEES OTHERS MAKING THESE SAME MISTAKES SUFFERING FOR LACK OF THAT SAME KNOWLEDGE WHICH HE HAS SO PAINFULLY ACQUIRED THIS BEING THE CASE IT SEEMS A FRIENDLY ACT TO OFFER HIS KNOWLEDGE
5190-87766-0001 THERE COME TO THE WRITER LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF LETTERS EVERY YEAR ASKING HIM QUESTIONS SOME OF THEM OF THE STRANGEST A MAN IS DYING OF CANCER AND DO I THINK IT CAN BE CURED BY A FAST
5190-87766-0002 A MAN IS UNABLE TO MAKE HIS WIFE HAPPY AND CAN I TELL HIM WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH WOMEN A MAN HAS INVESTED HIS SAVINGS IN MINING STOCK AND CAN I TELL HIM WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT
5190-87766-0003 A MAN WORKS IN A SWEATSHOP AND HAS ONLY A LITTLE TIME FOR SELF IMPROVEMENT AND WILL I TELL HIM WHAT BOOKS HE OUGHT TO READ MANY SUCH QUESTIONS EVERY DAY MAKE ONE AWARE OF A VAST MASS OF PEOPLE
5190-87766-0004 EARNEST HUNGRY FOR HAPPINESS AND GROPING AS IF IN A FOG THE THINGS THEY MOST NEED TO KNOW THEY ARE NOT TAUGHT IN THE SCHOOLS NOR IN THE NEWSPAPERS THEY READ NOR IN THE CHURCH THEY ATTEND OF THESE AGENCIES
5190-87766-0005 THE FIRST IS NOT ENTIRELY COMPETENT THE SECOND IS NOT ENTIRELY HONEST AND THE THIRD IS NOT ENTIRELY UP TO DATE NOR IS THERE ANYWHERE A BOOK IN WHICH THE EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO GIVE TO
5190-87766-0006 OF THEIR LIVES FOR THE PRESENT BOOK THE FOLLOWING CLAIMS MAY BE MADE FIRST IT IS A MODERN BOOK ITS WRITER WATCHES HOUR BY HOUR THE NEW ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE HUMAN MIND
5190-87766-0007 HE REACHES OUT FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THEM HE SEEKS TO ADJUST HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO THEM AND TO TEST THEM IN HIS OWN LIVING SECOND IT IS OR TRIES HARD TO BE A WISE BOOK
5190-87766-0008 ITS WRITER IS NOT AMONG THOSE TOO ARDENT YOUNG RADICALS WHO LEAP TO THE CONCLUSION THAT BECAUSE MANY OLD THINGS ARE STUPID AND TIRESOME THEREFORE EVERYTHING THAT IS OLD IS TO BE SPURNED WITH CONTEMPT AND EVERYTHING THAT PROCLAIMS ITSELF NEW
5190-87766-0009 FINALLY IT IS A KIND BOOK IT IS NOT WRITTEN FOR ITS AUTHOR'S GLORY NOR FOR HIS ENRICHMENT BUT TO TELL YOU THINGS THAT MAY BE USEFUL TO YOU IN THE BRIEF SPAN OF YOUR LIFE
5190-87766-0010 IT WILL ATTEMPT TO TELL YOU HOW TO LIVE HOW TO FIND HEALTH AND HAPPINESS AND SUCCESS HOW TO WORK AND HOW TO PLAY
5190-87766-0011 A LARGE ORDER AS THE BOYS PHRASE IT THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS FOR SUCH A BOOK TO BEGIN IT MIGHT BEGIN WITH THE CHILD BECAUSE WE ALL BEGIN THAT WAY IT MIGHT BEGIN WITH LOVE BECAUSE THAT PRECEDES THE CHILD
5190-87766-0012 IT MIGHT BEGIN WITH THE CARE OF THE BODY EXPLAINING THAT SOUND PHYSICAL HEALTH IS THE BASIS OF ALL RIGHT LIVING AND EVEN OF RIGHT THINKING IT MIGHT BEGIN AS MOST PHILOSOPHIES DO BY DEFINING LIFE DISCUSSING ITS ORIGIN
5190-87766-0013 AND FUNDAMENTAL NATURE THE TROUBLE WITH THIS LAST PLAN IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEIR IDEAS ON LIFE MADE UP IN TABLOID FORM THEY HAVE CREEDS AND CATECHISMS WHICH THEY KNOW BY HEART
5190-87766-0014 AND IF YOU SUGGEST TO THEM ANYTHING DIFFERENT THEY GIVE YOU A STARTLED LOOK AND GET OUT OF YOUR WAY AND THEN THERE IS ANOTHER AND IN OUR MODERN WORLD A STILL LARGER CLASS WHO SAY OH SHUCKS
5190-87766-0015 I DON'T GO IN FOR RELIGION AND THAT KIND OF THING YOU OFFER THEM SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A SERMON AND THEY TURN TO THE BASEBALL PAGE WHO WILL READ THIS BOOK OF LIFE THERE WILL BE AMONG OTHERS
5190-87766-0016 THE GREAT AMERICAN TIRED BUSINESS MAN HE WRESTLES WITH PROBLEMS AND CARES ALL DAY AND WHEN HE SITS DOWN TO READ IN THE EVENING HE SAYS MAKE IT SHORT AND SNAPPY THERE IS THE WIFE OF THE TIRED BUSINESS MAN
5190-87766-0017 THE AMERICAN PERFECT LADY SHE DOES MOST OF THE READING FOR THE FAMILY BUT SHE HAS NEVER GOT DOWN TO ANYTHING FUNDAMENTAL IN HER LIFE AND MOSTLY SHE LIKES TO READ ABOUT EXCITING LOVE AFFAIRS
5190-87766-0018 WHICH SHE DISTINGUISHES FROM THE UNEXCITING KIND SHE KNOWS BY THE WORD ROMANCE THEN THERE IS THE STILL MORE TIRED AMERICAN WORKINGMAN WHO HAS BEEN SPEEDED UP
5190-87766-0019 ALL DAY UNDER THE BONUS SYSTEM OR THE PIECE WORK SYSTEM AND IS APT TO FALL ASLEEP IN HIS CHAIR BEFORE HE FINISHES SUPPER THEN THERE IS THE WORKINGMAN'S WIFE WHO HAS SLAVED ALL DAY IN THE KITCHEN
5190-87766-0020 AND HAS A CHANCE FOR A FEW MINUTES INTIMACY WITH HER HUSBAND BEFORE HE FALLS ASLEEP SHE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOMEBODY TELL HER WHAT TO DO FOR CROUP BUT SHE IS NOT SURE THAT SHE HAS TIME TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION WHETHER LIFE IS WORTH LIVING
5190-87766-0021 YET I WONDER IS THERE A SINGLE ONE AMONG ALL THESE TIRED PEOPLE OR EVEN AMONG THE CYNICAL PEOPLE WHO HAS NOT HAD SOME MOMENT OF AWE WHEN THE THOUGHT CAME STABBING INTO HIS MIND LIKE A KNIFE
5190-87766-0022 WHAT A STRANGE THING THIS LIFE IS WHAT AM I ANYHOW WHERE DO I COME FROM AND WHAT IS GOING TO BECOME OF ME WHAT DO I MEAN WHAT AM I HERE FOR
5190-87766-0023 I HAVE SAT CHATTING WITH THREE HOBOES BY A RAILROAD TRACK COOKING THEMSELVES A MULLIGAN IN AN OLD CAN AND HEARD ONE OF THEM SAY BY GOD IT'S A QUEER THING AIN'T IT MATE
5190-87766-0024 AND HEARD HIM USE ALMOST THE IDENTICAL WORDS IT IS NOT ONLY IN THE CLASS ROOM AND THE SCHOOLS THAT THE MINDS OF MEN ARE GRAPPLING WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS IN FACT IT WAS NOT FROM THE SCHOOLS
5190-87766-0025 THAT THE NEW RELIGIONS AND THE GREAT MORAL IMPULSES OF HUMANITY TOOK THEIR ORIGIN IT WAS FROM LONELY SHEPHERDS SITTING ON THE HILLSIDES AND FROM FISHERMEN CASTING THEIR NETS AND FROM CARPENTERS AND TAILORS AND SHOEMAKERS AT THEIR BENCHES
5190-87766-0026 WHO WATCHES YOU DAY AND NIGHT AND KNOWS EVERY THOUGHT YOU THINK
5190-87766-0027 IF YOU OBEY HIS LAWS IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL TRY TO FIND OUT ABOUT HIS LAWS AND YOU WILL BE COMPARATIVELY LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF YOUR BUSINESS PERHAPS ON THE OTHER HAND
5190-87766-0028 YOU HAVE BEEN CHEATED AND EXPLOITED AND HAVE SET OUT TO GET YOURS AS THE PHRASE IS TO FEATHER YOUR OWN NEST BUT SOME GUST OF PASSION SEIZES YOU AND YOU WASTE YOUR SUBSTANCE YOU WRECK YOUR LIFE
5190-87766-0029 THEN YOU WONDER WHO SET THAT TRAP AND BAITED IT AM I A CREATURE OF BLIND INSTINCTS JEALOUSIES AND GREEDS AND HATES BEYOND MY OWN CONTROL ENTIRELY AM I A POOR FEEBLE INSECT
5190-87766-0030 TO KNOW A LITTLE OF WHAT THE WISE MEN OF THE PAST HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THEM AND MORE ESPECIALLY WHAT SCIENCE WITH ITS NEW TOOLS OF KNOWLEDGE MAY HAVE DISCOVERED THE WRITER OF THIS BOOK SPENT NINE YEARS OF HIS LIFE IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES
5190-87766-0031 ALSO HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN A CHURCH SO HE KNOWS THE ORTHODOX TEACHINGS
5190-87766-0032 THEN BEING DISSATISFIED HE WENT TO THE UNRECOGNIZED TEACHERS THE ENTHUSIASTS AND THE CRANKS OF A HUNDRED SCHOOLS FINALLY HE THOUGHT FOR HIMSELF HE WAS EVEN WILLING TO TRY EXPERIMENTS UPON HIMSELF
5190-87766-0033 TO GIVE YOU THE HARDEST PART FIRST THAT IS TO BEGIN WITH THE GREAT FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS WHAT IS LIFE AND HOW DOES IT COME TO BE WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND WHAT HAVE WE TO DO WITH IT
5190-87766-0034 ARE WE ITS MASTERS OR ITS SLAVES WHAT DOES IT OWE US AND WHAT DO WE OWE TO IT WHY IS IT SO HARD AND DO WE HAVE TO STAND ITS HARDNESS AND CAN WE REALLY KNOW ABOUT ALL THESE MATTERS
5190-87766-0035 OR WILL WE BE ONLY GUESSING CAN WE TRUST OURSELVES TO THINK ABOUT THEM OR SHALL WE BE SAFER IF WE BELIEVE WHAT WE ARE TOLD SHALL WE BE PUNISHED IF WE THINK WRONG AND HOW SHALL WE BE PUNISHED
5190-87766-0036 SHALL WE BE REWARDED IF WE THINK RIGHT AND WILL THE PAY BE WORTH THE TROUBLE SUCH QUESTIONS AS THESE I AM GOING TO TRY TO ANSWER IN THE SIMPLEST LANGUAGE POSSIBLE
5190-87766-0037 BUT SOME OF THESE LONG WORDS MEAN CERTAIN DEFINITE THINGS AND THERE ARE NO OTHER WORDS TO SERVE THE PURPOSE
