2526-156073-0000 MISS HOWE TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY MORNING MARCH SECOND INDEED YOU WOULD NOT BE IN LOVE WITH HIM FOR THE WORLD YOUR SERVANT MY DEAR NOR WOULD I HAVE YOU
2526-156073-0001 FOR I THINK WITH ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF PERSON FORTUNE AND FAMILY HE IS NOT BY ANY MEANS WORTHY OF YOU AND THIS OPINION I GIVE AS WELL FROM THE REASONS YOU MENTION WHICH I CANNOT BUT CONFIRM
2526-156073-0002 AS FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD OF HIM BUT A FEW HOURS AGO
2526-156073-0003 A FAVOURITE OF LADY BETTY LAWRANCE WHO KNOWS HIM WELL BUT LET ME CONGRATULATE YOU HOWEVER
2526-156073-0004 INTO A LAP DOG WELL BUT IF YOU HAVE NOT THE THROBS AND THE GLOWS YOU HAVE NOT AND ARE NOT IN LOVE GOOD REASON WHY BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT BE IN LOVE
2526-156073-0005 AND THERE'S NO MORE TO BE SAID ONLY MY DEAR I SHALL KEEP A GOOD LOOK OUT UPON YOU
2526-156073-0006 YOU THEREFORE ARE NOT BUT BEFORE I PART ENTIRELY WITH THIS SUBJECT A WORD IN YOUR EAR MY CHARMING FRIEND
2526-156073-0007 AS HAVE NOT ALLOWED YOU TO ATTEND TO THE THROBS OR IF YOU HAD THEM A LITTLE NOW AND THEN WHETHER HAVING HAD TWO ACCOUNTS TO PLACE THEM TO
2526-156073-0008 NOR WILL I KEEP YOU LONGER IN SUSPENSE AN HUNDRED WILD STORIES SHE TELLS OF HIM FROM CHILDHOOD TO MANHOOD FOR AS SHE OBSERVED HAVING NEVER BEEN SUBJECT TO CONTRADICTION HE WAS ALWAYS AS MISCHIEVOUS AS A MONKEY
2526-156073-0009 ALTHOUGH INDICATIVE ONES AS I MAY SAY TO TAKE NOTICE AS WELL OF SOME THINGS YOU ARE NOT QUITE IGNORANT OF AS OF OTHERS YOU KNOW NOT AND TO MAKE A FEW OBSERVATIONS UPON HIM AND HIS WAYS
2526-156073-0010 THAT HE IS NOTORIOUSLY NAY AVOWEDLY A MAN OF PLEASURE YET SAYS THAT IN ANY THING HE SETS HIS HEART UPON OR UNDERTAKES HE IS THE MOST INDUSTRIOUS AND PERSEVERING MORTAL UNDER THE SUN
2526-156073-0011 HE RESTS IT SEEMS NOT ABOVE SIX HOURS IN THE TWENTY FOUR ANY MORE THAN YOU HE DELIGHTS IN WRITING
2526-156073-0012 ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS CONFIRMING HIS LOVE OF WRITING HAS TOLD HER THAT HIS THOUGHTS FLOW RAPIDLY TO HIS PEN AND YOU AND I MY DEAR HAVE OBSERVED ON MORE OCCASIONS THAN ONE
2526-156073-0013 HE IS ONE OF THE READIEST AND QUICKEST OF WRITERS HE MUST INDEED HAVE HAD EARLY A VERY DOCILE GENIUS SINCE A PERSON OF HIS PLEASURABLE TURN AND ACTIVE SPIRIT
2526-156073-0014 COULD NEVER HAVE SUBMITTED TO TAKE LONG OR GREAT PAINS IN ATTAINING THE QUALIFICATIONS HE IS MASTER OF QUALIFICATIONS SO SELDOM ATTAINED BY YOUTH OF QUALITY AND FORTUNE BY SUCH ESPECIALLY
2526-156073-0015 WHO LIKE HIM HAVE NEVER KNOWN WHAT IT WAS TO BE CONTROULED HE HAD ONCE IT SEEMS THE VANITY UPON BEING COMPLIMENTED ON THESE TALENTS AND ON HIS SURPRISING DILIGENCE FOR A MAN OF PLEASURE TO COMPARE HIMSELF TO JULIUS CAESAR
2526-156073-0016 WHO PERFORMED GREAT ACTIONS BY DAY AND WROTE THEM DOWN AT NIGHT AND VALUED HIMSELF THAT HE ONLY WANTED CAESAR'S OUT SETTING TO MAKE A FIGURE AMONG HIS CONTEMPORARIES
2526-156073-0017 HE SPOKE OF THIS INDEED SHE SAYS WITH AN AIR OF PLEASANTRY FOR SHE OBSERVED AND SO HAVE WE THAT HE HAS THE ART OF ACKNOWLEDGING HIS VANITY
2526-156073-0018 WHICH IS DUE TO VANITY AND SELF OPINION AND AT THE SAME TIME HALF PERSUADES THOSE WHO HEAR HIM THAT HE REALLY DESERVES THE EXULTATION HE GIVES HIMSELF BUT SUPPOSING IT TO BE TRUE THAT ALL HIS VACANT NIGHTLY HOURS ARE EMPLOYED IN WRITING
2526-156073-0019 WHAT CAN BE HIS SUBJECTS IF LIKE CAESAR HIS OWN ACTIONS HE MUST UNDOUBTEDLY BE A VERY ENTERPRISING AND VERY WICKED MAN SINCE NOBODY SUSPECTS HIM TO HAVE A SERIOUS TURN AND DECENT
2526-156073-0020 AS HE IS IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH US HIS WRITINGS ARE NOT PROBABLY SUCH AS WOULD REDOUND EITHER TO HIS OWN HONOUR OR TO THE BENEFIT OF OTHERS WERE THEY TO BE READ HE MUST BE CONSCIOUS OF THIS
2526-156073-0021 THAT IN THE GREAT CORRESPONDENCE BY LETTERS WHICH HE HOLDS HE IS AS SECRET AND AS CAREFUL AS IF IT WERE OF A TREASONABLE NATURE YET TROUBLES NOT HIS HEAD WITH POLITICS THOUGH NOBODY KNOWS THE INTERESTS OF PRINCES AND COURTS BETTER THAN HE IS SAID TO DO
2526-156073-0022 THAT YOU AND I MY DEAR SHOULD LOVE TO WRITE IS NO WONDER WE HAVE ALWAYS FROM THE TIME EACH COULD HOLD A PEN DELIGHTED IN EPISTOLARY CORRESPONDENCIES OUR EMPLOYMENTS ARE DOMESTIC AND SEDENTARY
2526-156073-0023 AND WE CAN SCRIBBLE UPON TWENTY INNOCENT SUBJECTS AND TAKE DELIGHT IN THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE INNOCENT THOUGH WERE THEY TO BE SEEN
2526-156073-0024 OTHERS BUT THAT SUCH A GAY LIVELY YOUNG FELLOW AS THIS WHO RIDES HUNTS TRAVELS
2526-156073-0025 AS YOU AND I HAVE HEARD HIM SAY HE FREQUENTLY DOES THAT IS THE STRANGE THING
2526-156073-0026 THAT HE IS A COMPLETE MASTER OF SHORT HAND WRITING BY THE WAY WHAT INDUCEMENTS COULD A SWIFT WRITER AS HE HAVE TO LEARN SHORT HAND SHE SAYS AND WE KNOW IT AS WELL AS SHE
2526-156073-0027 AND A VERY LIVELY IMAGINATION WHATEVER HIS OTHER VICES ARE
2526-156073-0028 HE IS A SOBER MAN AND AMONG ALL HIS BAD QUALITIES GAMING THAT GREAT WASTER OF TIME AS WELL AS FORTUNE IS NOT HIS VICE SO THAT HE MUST HAVE HIS HEAD AS COOL AND HIS REASON AS CLEAR
2526-156073-0029 AS THE PRIME OF YOUTH AND HIS NATURAL GAIETY WILL PERMIT AND BY HIS EARLY MORNING HOURS
2526-156073-0030 THAT ALL HIS RELATIONS ARE AFRAID OF HIM
2526-156073-0031 SHE BELIEVES HE IS CLEAR OF THE WORLD AND THAT HE WILL CONTINUE SO
2526-156073-0032 THAT A BRAVE A LEARNED AND A DILIGENT MAN CANNOT BE NATURALLY A BAD MAN
2526-156073-0033 IN BEING SO CARELESS AS HE IS OF HIS REPUTATION I THINK A MAN CAN BE SO BUT FROM ONE OF THESE TWO REASONS EITHER THAT HE IS CONSCIOUS HE DESERVES THE ILL SPOKEN OF HIM OR THAT HE TAKES A PRIDE
2526-156073-0034 IN BEING THOUGHT WORSE THAN HE IS BOTH VERY BAD AND THREATENING INDICATIONS SINCE THE FIRST MUST SHEW HIM TO BE UTTERLY ABANDONED AND IT IS BUT NATURAL TO CONCLUDE FROM THE OTHER
2526-156073-0035 HE WILL NOT SCRUPLE TO BE GUILTY OF WHENEVER HE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY UPON THE WHOLE
2526-156073-0036 MISTER LOVELACE IS A VERY FAULTY MAN YOU AND I HAVE THOUGHT HIM TOO GAY TOO INCONSIDERATE TOO RASH
2526-156073-0037 TO BE DEEP YOU SEE
2526-156073-0038 HAUGHTY AS IT CERTAINLY IS
2526-156073-0039 HE PAYS IT TO THE UTTERMOST NOR HAS HE COMPLAISANCE ENOUGH TO SPARE YOUR UNCLES BUT WERE HE DEEP AND EVER SO DEEP YOU WOULD SOON PENETRATE HIM IF THEY WOULD LEAVE YOU TO YOURSELF
2526-156073-0040 HIS VANITY WOULD BE YOUR CLUE NEVER MAN HAD MORE YET AS MISSUS FORTESCUE OBSERVED NEVER DID MAN CARRY IT OFF SO HAPPILY THERE IS A STRANGE MIXTURE IN IT OF HUMOUROUS VIVACITY
2526-156073-0041 AND IS BUT JUST GONE AWAY HE IS ALL IMPATIENCE AND RESENTMENT AT THE TREATMENT YOU MEET WITH AND FULL OF APPREHENSIONS TOO THAT THEY WILL CARRY THEIR POINT WITH YOU
2526-156073-0042 THAT YOU WILL NEVER BE BROUGHT TO THINK OF SUCH A MAN AS SOLMES
2526-156073-0043 EVER HAD SO LITTLE FAVOUR FROM A WOMAN FOR WHOSE SAKE HE HAD BORNE SO MUCH I TOLD HIM MY MIND AS FREELY AS I USED TO DO BUT WHOEVER WAS IN FAULT
2526-156073-0044 HE COMPLAINED OF SPIES SET UPON HIS CONDUCT AND TO PRY INTO HIS LIFE AND MORALS AND THIS BY YOUR BROTHER AND UNCLES I TOLD HIM THAT THIS WAS VERY HARD UPON HIM
2526-156073-0045 AND THE MORE SO AS NEITHER HIS LIFE NOR MORALS PERHAPS WOULD STAND A FAIR INQUIRY HE SMILED AND CALLED HIMSELF MY SERVANT THE OCCASION WAS TOO FAIR HE SAID FOR MISS HOWE WHO NEVER SPARED HIM TO LET IT PASS
2526-156073-0046 I ASKED HIM IF HE VALUED HIMSELF UPON HAVING A HEAD BETTER TURNED THAN THEIRS FOR SUCH WORKS AS HE CALLED THEM HE DREW OFF AND THEN RAN INTO THE HIGHEST PROFESSIONS OF REVERENCE AND AFFECTION FOR YOU
2526-156073-0047 THE OBJECT SO MERITORIOUS WHO CAN DOUBT THE REALITY OF HIS PROFESSIONS ADIEU MY DEAREST MY NOBLE FRIEND
2526-156073-0048 THOUGH I BEGAN THIS LETTER WITH IMPERTINENT RAILLERY KNOWING THAT YOU ALWAYS LOVED TO INDULGE MY MAD VEIN YET NEVER WAS THERE A HEART THAT MORE GLOWED WITH FRIENDLY LOVE THAN THAT OF YOUR OWN
