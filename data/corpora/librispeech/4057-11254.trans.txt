4057-11254-0000 GREAT CITY SNOBS THERE IS NO DISGUISING THE FACT THAT THIS SERIES OF PAPERS IS MAKING A PRODIGIOUS SENSATION AMONG ALL CLASSES IN THIS EMPIRE NOTES OF ADMIRATION OF INTERROGATION OF REMONSTRANCE APPROVAL OR ABUSE
4057-11254-0001 WE HAVE BEEN CALLED TO TASK FOR BETRAYING THE SECRETS OF THREE DIFFERENT FAMILIES OF DE MOGYNS NO LESS THAN FOUR LADY SCRAPERS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED AND YOUNG GENTLEMEN ARE QUITE SHY OF ORDERING HALF A PINT OF PORT

4057-11254-0005 SOME WAG HINTS I SAW LORD B LEANING OUT OF THE WINDOW WITH HIS BOOTS IN HIS HAND AND BAWLING OUT
4057-11254-0006 NO FAR FROM IT IF HIS LORDSHIP'S BOOTS ARE DIRTY IT IS BECAUSE HE IS LORD B AND WALKS THERE IS NOTHING SNOBBISH IN HAVING ONLY ONE PAIR OF BOOTS OR A FAVOURITE PAIR
4057-11254-0007 AND CERTAINLY NOTHING SNOBBISH IN DESIRING TO HAVE THEM CLEANED LORD B IN SO DOING PERFORMED A PERFECTLY NATURAL AND GENTLEMANLIKE ACTION FOR WHICH I AM SO PLEASED WITH HIM
4057-11254-0008 AND PUT AT THE HEAD OF THIS CHAPTER
4057-11254-0009 NO WE ARE NOT PERSONAL IN THESE CANDID REMARKS AS PHIDIAS TOOK THE PICK OF A SCORE OF BEAUTIES BEFORE HE COMPLETED A VENUS SO HAVE WE TO EXAMINE PERHAPS A THOUSAND SNOBS
4057-11254-0010 GREAT CITY SNOBS ARE THE NEXT IN THE HIERARCHY AND OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED BUT HERE IS A DIFFICULTY
4057-11254-0011 YOU CANNOT VISIT HIM IN THE RECESSES OF HIS BANK PARLOUR IN LOMBARD STREET UNLESS YOU ARE A SPRIG OF NOBILITY THERE IS LITTLE HOPE OF SEEING HIM AT HOME IN A GREAT CITY SNOB FIRM
4057-11254-0012 THERE IS GENERALLY ONE PARTNER WHOSE NAME IS DOWN FOR CHARITIES AND WHO FREQUENTS EXETER HALL YOU MAY CATCH A GLIMPSE OF ANOTHER A SCIENTIFIC CITY SNOB
4057-11254-0013 OR THE LECTURES OF THE LONDON INSTITUTION OF A THIRD A CITY SNOB OF TASTE AT PICTURE AUCTIONS AT PRIVATE VIEWS OF EXHIBITIONS OR AT THE OPERA OR THE PHILHARMONIC BUT INTIMACY IS IMPOSSIBLE IN MOST CASES
4057-11254-0014 WITH THIS GRAVE POMPOUS AND AWFUL BEING A MERE GENTLEMAN MAY HOPE TO SIT AT ALMOST ANYBODY'S TABLE TO TAKE HIS PLACE AT MY LORD DUKE'S IN THE COUNTRY TO DANCE A QUADRILLE AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE ITSELF
4057-11254-0015 BELOVED LADY WILHELMINA WAGGLEWIGGLE DO YOU RECOLLECT THE SENSATION WE MADE AT THE BALL OF OUR LATE ADORED SOVEREIGN QUEEN CAROLINE AT BRANDENBURG HOUSE HAMMERSMITH BUT THE CITY SNOB'S DOORS ARE FOR THE MOST PART CLOSED TO HIM
4057-11254-0016 I LIKE THE SPIRIT OF THE FIRST NAMED NOBLEMAN TITLES NOT COSTING MUCH IN THE ROMAN TERRITORY
4057-11254-0017 IN EXCHANGE AS DEXTEROUSLY AS ANY COMMONER COULD DO IT IS A COMFORT TO BE ABLE TO GRATIFY SUCH GRANDEES WITH A FARTHING OR TWO IT MAKES THE POOREST MAN FEEL THAT HE CAN DO GOOD THE POLONIAS
4057-11254-0018 HAVE INTERMARRIED WITH THE GREATEST AND MOST ANCIENT FAMILIES OF ROME AND YOU SEE THEIR HERALDIC COGNIZANCE A MUSHROOM OR ON AN AZURE FIELD QUARTERED IN A HUNDRED PLACES IN THE CITY WITH THE ARMS OF THE COLONNAS AND DORIAS
4057-11254-0019 CITY SNOBS HAVE THE SAME MANIA FOR ARISTOCRATIC MARRIAGES I LIKE TO SEE SUCH I AM OF A SAVAGE AND ENVIOUS NATURE I LIKE TO SEE THESE TWO HUMBUGS WHICH DIVIDING AS THEY DO
4057-11254-0020 THE SOCIAL EMPIRE OF THIS KINGDOM BETWEEN THEM HATE EACH OTHER NATURALLY MAKING TRUCE AND UNITING FOR THE SORDID INTERESTS OF EITHER I LIKE TO SEE AN OLD ARISTOCRAT SWELLING WITH PRIDE OF RACE
4057-11254-0021 AND WHO LOOKS DOWN UPON COMMON ENGLISHMEN AS A FREE AMERICAN DOES ON A NIGGER I LIKE TO SEE OLD STIFFNECK OBLIGED TO BOW DOWN HIS HEAD AND SWALLOW HIS INFERNAL PRIDE AND DRINK THE CUP OF HUMILIATION POURED OUT BY PUMP AND ALDGATE'S BUTLER
4057-11254-0022 PUMP AND ALDGATE SAYS HE YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS A BRICKLAYER AND HIS HOD IS STILL KEPT IN THE BANK YOUR PEDIGREE BEGINS IN A WORKHOUSE MINE CAN BE DATED FROM ALL THE ROYAL PALACES OF EUROPE I CAME OVER WITH THE CONQUEROR
4057-11254-0023 I AM OWN COUSIN TO CHARLES MARTEL ORLANDO FURIOSO PHILIP AUGUSTUS PETER THE CRUEL
4057-11254-0024 AND A COMFORTABLE THING IT IS TO THINK THAT BIRTH CAN BE BOUGHT FOR MONEY SO YOU LEARN TO VALUE IT WHY SHOULD WE WHO DON'T POSSESS IT SET A HIGHER STORE ON IT THAN THOSE WHO DO PERHAPS THE BEST USE OF THAT BOOK THE PEERAGE
4057-11254-0025 IS TO LOOK DOWN THE LIST AND SEE HOW MANY HAVE BOUGHT AND SOLD BIRTH HOW POOR SPRIGS OF NOBILITY SOMEHOW SELL THEMSELVES TO RICH CITY SNOBS DAUGHTERS HOW RICH CITY SNOBS PURCHASE NOBLE LADIES
4057-11254-0026 AND SO TO ADMIRE THE DOUBLE BASENESS OF THE BARGAIN OLD PUMP AND ALDGATE BUYS THE ARTICLE AND PAYS THE MONEY THE SALE OF THE GIRL'S PERSON IS BLESSED BY A BISHOP AT SAINT GEORGE'S HANOVER SQUARE AND NEXT YEAR YOU READ
4057-11254-0027 AT ROEHAMPTON ON SATURDAY THE LADY BLANCHE PUMP OF A SON AND HEIR AFTER THIS INTERESTING EVENT SOME OLD ACQUAINTANCE WHO SAW YOUNG PUMP IN THE PARLOUR AT THE BANK IN THE CITY SAID TO HIM FAMILIARLY

4057-11254-0031 BUT WHO IS RESIGNED TO REBUFFS AND DELAY AND HUMILIATION CONTENTED TO THINK THAT HIS SON WILL BE MORE FORTUNATE IT USED TO BE THE CUSTOM OF SOME VERY OLD FASHIONED CLUBS IN THIS CITY WHEN A GENTLEMAN ASKED FOR CHANGE A GUINEA
4057-11254-0032 ALWAYS TO BRING IT TO HIM IN WASHED SILVER THAT WHICH HAD PASSED IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE HANDS OF VULGAR BEING CONSIDERED AS TOO COARSE TO SOIL A GENTLEMAN'S FINGERS SO WHEN THE CITY SNOB'S MONEY HAS BEEN WASHED DURING A GENERATION OR SO
4057-11254-0033 HAS BEEN WASHED INTO ESTATES AND WOODS AND CASTLES AND TOWN MANSIONS IT IS ALLOWED TO PASS CURRENT AS REAL ARISTOCRATIC COIN OLD PUMP SWEEPS A SHOP RUNS OF MESSAGES BECOMES A CONFIDENTIAL CLERK AND PARTNER
4057-11254-0034 PUMP THE SECOND BECOMES CHIEF OF THE HOUSE
