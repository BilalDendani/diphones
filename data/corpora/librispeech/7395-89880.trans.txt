7395-89880-0000 HE WROTE JOINTLY WITH HIS FELLOW BISHOPS A HORTATORY EPISTLE ENTREATING AND CONJURING THEM TO KEEP THE UNITY OF PEACE AND CATHOLIC OBSERVANCE WITH THE CHURCH OF CHRIST SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
7395-89880-0001 AND IT WAS OUR LOT TO COME INTO THIS ISLAND WHICH IS CALLED BRITAIN BEFORE WE KNEW THEM
7395-89880-0002 BY WHICH HE ENDEAVOURED TO CONFIRM THEM IN CATHOLIC UNITY
7395-89880-0003 AS LIKEWISE TO KING ETHELBERT AND THE ENGLISH NATION THIS POPE WAS BONIFACE THE FOURTH AFTER THE BLESSED GREGORY BISHOP OF THE CITY OF ROME HE OBTAINED FOR THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FROM THE EMPEROR PHOCAS THE GIFT OF THE TEMPLE AT ROME CALLED BY THE ANCIENTS
7395-89880-0004 ETHELBERT KING OF KENT HAVING MOST GLORIOUSLY GOVERNED HIS TEMPORAL KINGDOM FIFTY SIX YEARS ENTERED INTO THE ETERNAL JOYS OF THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
7395-89880-0005 THE THIRD AS HAS BEEN SAID WAS ETHELBERT KING OF KENT THE FOURTH WAS REDWALD KING OF THE EAST ANGLES WHO EVEN IN THE LIFE TIME OF ETHELBERT HAD BEEN ACQUIRING THE LEADERSHIP FOR HIS OWN RACE
7395-89880-0006 THE FIFTH WAS EDWIN KING OF THE NORTHUMBRIAN NATION THAT IS OF THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE DISTRICT TO THE NORTH OF THE RIVER HUMBER HIS POWER WAS GREATER
7395-89880-0007 AND FOR THE MOST PART SUBDUED AND MADE TRIBUTARY THE NATIONS OF THE PICTS AND SCOTS WHO OCCUPY THE NORTHERN PARTS OF BRITAIN
7395-89880-0008 WITHOUT THE SCOURGE OF DIVINE SEVERITY IN CHASTISEMENT AND CORRECTION FOR HE WAS TROUBLED WITH FREQUENT FITS OF MADNESS AND POSSESSED BY AN UNCLEAN SPIRIT
7395-89880-0009 THE STORM OF THIS DISTURBANCE WAS INCREASED BY THE DEATH OF SABERT KING OF THE EAST SAXONS WHO DEPARTING TO THE HEAVENLY KINGDOM LEFT THREE SONS STILL PAGANS TO INHERIT HIS TEMPORAL CROWN
7395-89880-0010 THEY IMMEDIATELY BEGAN OPENLY TO GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO IDOLATRY WHICH DURING THEIR FATHER'S LIFETIME THEY HAD SEEMED SOMEWHAT TO ABANDON AND THEY GRANTED FREE LICENCE TO THEIR SUBJECTS TO SERVE IDOLS AND WHEN THEY SAW THE BISHOP
7395-89880-0011 WHILST CELEBRATING MASS IN THE CHURCH GIVE THE EUCHARIST TO THE PEOPLE FILLED AS THEY WERE WITH FOLLY AND IGNORANCE THEY SAID TO HIM AS IS COMMONLY REPORTED
7395-89880-0012 AND WHICH YOU STILL CONTINUE TO GIVE TO THE PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH TO WHOM HE ANSWERED IF YOU WILL BE WASHED IN THAT FONT OF SALVATION IN WHICH YOUR FATHER WAS WASHED YOU MAY ALSO PARTAKE OF THE HOLY BREAD OF WHICH HE PARTOOK
7395-89880-0013 BUT IF YOU DESPISE THE LAVER OF LIFE YOU CAN IN NO WISE RECEIVE THE BREAD OF LIFE THEY REPLIED WE WILL NOT ENTER INTO THAT FONT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE DO NOT STAND IN NEED OF IT AND YET WE WILL BE REFRESHED BY THAT BREAD
7395-89880-0014 AND BEING OFTEN EARNESTLY ADMONISHED BY HIM THAT THIS COULD BY NO MEANS BE DONE NOR WOULD ANY ONE BE ADMITTED TO PARTAKE OF THE SACRED OBLATION WITHOUT THE HOLY CLEANSING AT LAST THEY SAID FILLED WITH RAGE
7395-89880-0015 IF YOU WILL NOT COMPLY WITH US IN SO SMALL A MATTER AS THAT WHICH WE REQUIRE YOU SHALL NOT STAY IN OUR PROVINCE
7395-89880-0016 WHEREIN HAVING LAID HIMSELF TO REST AFTER HE HAD WITH TEARS POURED FORTH MANY PRAYERS TO GOD FOR THE STATE OF THE CHURCH HE FELL ASLEEP IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT THE BLESSED CHIEF OF THE APOSTLES APPEARED TO HIM
7395-89880-0017 AND SCOURGING HIM GRIEVOUSLY A LONG TIME ASKED OF HIM WITH APOSTOLIC SEVERITY WHY HE WAS FORSAKING THE FLOCK WHICH HE HAD COMMITTED TO HIM OR TO WHAT SHEPHERD HE WAS LEAVING BY HIS FLIGHT CHRIST'S SHEEP THAT WERE IN THE MIDST OF WOLVES
7395-89880-0018 HAST THOU HE SAID FORGOTTEN MY EXAMPLE WHO FOR THE SAKE OF THOSE LITTLE ONES WHOM CHRIST COMMENDED TO ME IN TOKEN OF HIS AFFECTION UNDERWENT AT THE HANDS OF INFIDELS AND ENEMIES OF CHRIST
7395-89880-0019 BONDS STRIPES IMPRISONMENT AFFLICTIONS AND LASTLY DEATH ITSELF EVEN THE DEATH OF THE CROSS THAT I MIGHT AT LAST BE CROWNED WITH HIM LAURENTIUS THE SERVANT OF CHRIST
7395-89880-0020 WENT TO THE KING AS SOON AS MORNING BROKE AND LAYING ASIDE HIS GARMENT SHOWED THE SCARS OF THE STRIPES WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED THE KING ASTONISHED ASKED WHO HAD PRESUMED TO INFLICT SUCH STRIPES ON SO GREAT A MAN
7395-89880-0021 AND WHEN HE HEARD THAT FOR THE SAKE OF HIS SALVATION THE BISHOP HAD SUFFERED THESE CRUEL BLOWS AT THE HANDS OF THE APOSTLE OF CHRIST HE WAS GREATLY AFRAID
7395-89880-0022 AND ABJURING THE WORSHIP OF IDOLS AND RENOUNCING HIS UNLAWFUL MARRIAGE HE RECEIVED THE FAITH OF CHRIST AND BEING BAPTIZED PROMOTED AND SUPPORTED THE INTERESTS OF THE CHURCH TO THE UTMOST OF HIS POWER
7395-89880-0023 THEY CAME BACK ONE YEAR AFTER THEIR DEPARTURE AND JUSTUS RETURNED TO THE CITY OF ROCHESTER WHERE HE HAD BEFORE PRESIDED BUT THE PEOPLE OF LONDON WOULD NOT RECEIVE BISHOP MELLITUS CHOOSING RATHER TO BE UNDER THEIR IDOLATROUS HIGH PRIESTS
7395-89880-0024 FOR KING EADBALD HAD NOT SO MUCH AUTHORITY IN THE KINGDOM AS HIS FATHER
7395-89880-0025 IN SHORT THAT I MAY GIVE ONE INSTANCE OF HIS POWER FROM WHICH THE REST MAY BE INFERRED IT HAPPENED ONCE THAT THE CITY OF CANTERBURY BEING SET ON FIRE THROUGH CARELESSNESS WAS IN DANGER OF BEING CONSUMED BY THE SPREADING CONFLAGRATION
7395-89880-0026 WATER WAS THROWN ON THE FIRE IN VAIN A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE CITY WAS ALREADY DESTROYED AND THE FIERCE FLAMES WERE ADVANCING TOWARDS THE BISHOP'S ABODE
7395-89880-0027 WHEN HE TRUSTING IN GOD WHERE HUMAN HELP FAILED ORDERED HIMSELF TO BE CARRIED TOWARDS THE RAGING MASSES OF FIRE WHICH WERE SPREADING ON EVERY SIDE
7395-89880-0028 THE BISHOP BEING CARRIED THITHER BY HIS SERVANTS WEAK AS HE WAS SET ABOUT AVERTING BY PRAYER THE DANGER WHICH THE STRONG HANDS OF ACTIVE MEN HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO OVERCOME WITH ALL THEIR EXERTIONS
7395-89880-0029 IMMEDIATELY THE WIND WHICH BLOWING FROM THE SOUTH HAD SPREAD THE CONFLAGRATION THROUGHOUT THE CITY VEERED TO THE NORTH AND THUS PREVENTED THE DESTRUCTION OF THOSE PLACES THAT HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO ITS FULL VIOLENCE
7395-89880-0030 THEN IT CEASED ENTIRELY AND THERE WAS A CALM WHILE THE FLAMES LIKEWISE SANK AND WERE EXTINGUISHED
7395-89880-0031 AND BECAUSE THE MAN OF GOD BURNED WITH THE FIRE OF DIVINE LOVE AND WAS WONT TO DRIVE AWAY THE STORMS OF THE POWERS OF THE AIR BY HIS FREQUENT PRAYERS AND AT HIS BIDDING FROM DOING HARM TO HIMSELF OR HIS PEOPLE IT WAS MEET THAT HE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PREVAIL OVER THE WINDS AND FLAMES OF THIS WORLD AND TO OBTAIN THAT THEY SHOULD NOT INJURE HIM OR HIS
7395-89880-0032 OF WHICH LICENCE THIS IS THE FORM BONIFACE TO HIS MOST BELOVED BROTHER JUSTUS
7395-89880-0033 OPENING THE HEARTS OF THE NATIONS TO RECEIVE THE WONDROUS MYSTERY OF YOUR PREACHING
7395-89880-0034 FOR HE HAS BLESSED WITH A RICH REWARD YOUR EMINENCE'S ACCEPTABLE COURSE BY THE SUPPORT OF HIS LOVING KINDNESS GRANTING A PLENTIFUL INCREASE TO YOUR LABOURS IN THE FAITHFUL MANAGEMENT OF THE TALENTS COMMITTED TO YOU
7395-89880-0035 YOU HAVE AWAITED WITH PRAISEWORTHY PATIENCE THE REDEMPTION OF THAT NATION AND THAT THEY MIGHT PROFIT BY YOUR MERITS SALVATION HAS BEEN BESTOWED ON THEM
7395-89880-0036 THEREFORE FIRMLY CONFIDING IN THE LONG SUFFERING OF THE DIVINE CLEMENCY WE BELIEVE THAT THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF YOUR PREACHING THERE WILL ENSUE MOST FULL SALVATION NOT ONLY OF THE NATIONS SUBJECT TO HIM BUT ALSO OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS
7395-89880-0037 TO THE END THAT AS IT IS WRITTEN THE RECOMPENSE OF A PERFECT WORK MAY BE CONFERRED ON YOU BY THE LORD THE REWARDER OF ALL THE JUST AND THAT THE UNIVERSAL CONFESSION OF ALL NATIONS HAVING RECEIVED THE MYSTERY OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH MAY DECLARE THAT IN TRUTH THEIR SOUND IS GONE OUT INTO ALL THE EARTH
7395-89880-0038 GIVING YOU AUTHORITY TO USE IT ONLY IN THE CELEBRATION OF THE SACRED MYSTERIES GRANTING TO YOU LIKEWISE TO ORDAIN BISHOPS WHEN THERE SHALL BE OCCASION THROUGH THE LORD'S MERCY THAT SO THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST BY THE PREACHING OF MANY
7395-89880-0039 MAY BE SPREAD ABROAD IN ALL THE NATIONS THAT ARE NOT YET CONVERTED
7395-89880-0040 YOU MUST THEREFORE ENDEAVOUR MY BROTHER TO PRESERVE WITH UNBLEMISHED SINCERITY OF MIND THAT WHICH YOU HAVE RECEIVED THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF THE APOSTOLIC SEE BEARING IN MIND WHAT IT IS THAT IS REPRESENTED BY THE HONOURABLE VESTMENT WHICH YOU HAVE OBTAINED TO BE BORNE ON YOUR SHOULDERS
7395-89880-0041 AND IMPLORING THE DIVINE MERCY STUDY TO SHOW YOURSELF SUCH THAT YOU MAY PRESENT BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL OF THE SUPREME JUDGE THAT IS TO COME THE REWARDS OF THE FAVOUR GRANTED TO YOU NOT WITH GUILTINESS BUT WITH THE BENEFIT OF SOULS
7395-89880-0042 GOD PRESERVE YOU IN SAFETY MOST DEAR BROTHER
7395-89880-0043 AND HOW PAULINUS COMING TO PREACH THE GOSPEL FIRST CONVERTED HIS DAUGHTER AND OTHERS TO THE MYSTERIES OF THE FAITH OF CHRIST
7395-89880-0044 HE RECEIVED THE ANSWER THAT IT WAS NOT LAWFUL TO GIVE A CHRISTIAN MAIDEN IN MARRIAGE TO A PAGAN HUSBAND LEST THE FAITH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE HEAVENLY KING SHOULD BE PROFANED BY HER UNION WITH A KING THAT WAS ALTOGETHER A STRANGER TO THE WORSHIP OF THE TRUE GOD
7395-89880-0045 THIS ANSWER BEING BROUGHT TO EDWIN BY HIS MESSENGERS HE PROMISED THAT HE WOULD IN NO MANNER ACT IN OPPOSITION TO THE CHRISTIAN FAITH WHICH THE MAIDEN PROFESSED BUT WOULD GIVE LEAVE TO HER AND ALL THAT WENT WITH HER MEN AND WOMEN BISHOPS AND CLERGY TO FOLLOW THEIR FAITH AND WORSHIP AFTER THE CUSTOM OF THE CHRISTIANS
7395-89880-0046 NOR DID HE REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT RELIGION HIMSELF IF BEING EXAMINED BY WISE MEN IT SHOULD BE FOUND MORE HOLY AND MORE WORTHY OF GOD
7395-89880-0047 SO THE MAIDEN WAS PROMISED AND SENT TO EDWIN AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AGREEMENT PAULINUS A MAN BELOVED OF GOD WAS ORDAINED BISHOP TO GO WITH HER AND BY DAILY EXHORTATIONS AND CELEBRATING THE HEAVENLY MYSTERIES TO CONFIRM HER AND HER COMPANY LEST THEY SHOULD BE CORRUPTED BY INTERCOURSE WITH THE PAGANS
7395-89880-0048 AND SO CAME TO KING EDWIN WITH THE AFORESAID MAIDEN AS AN ATTENDANT ON THEIR UNION IN THE FLESH BUT HIS MIND WAS WHOLLY BENT UPON CALLING THE NATION TO WHICH HE WAS SENT TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH ACCORDING TO THE WORDS OF THE APOSTLE
7395-89880-0049 BUT IF HAPLY HE MIGHT TO CONVERT SOME OF THE PAGANS TO THE GRACE OF THE FAITH BY HIS PREACHING
7395-89880-0050 HE HAD A TWO EDGED DAGGER DIPPED IN POISON TO THE END THAT IF THE WOUND INFLICTED BY THE WEAPON DID NOT AVAIL TO KILL THE KING IT MIGHT BE AIDED BY THE DEADLY VENOM
7395-89880-0051 WHILST UNFOLDING IN CUNNING WORDS HIS PRETENDED EMBASSY HE STARTED UP ON A SUDDEN AND UNSHEATHING THE DAGGER UNDER HIS GARMENT ASSAULTED THE KING
7395-89880-0052 WHEN LILLA THE KING'S MOST DEVOTED SERVANT SAW THIS HAVING NO BUCKLER AT HAND TO PROTECT THE KING FROM DEATH HE AT ONCE INTERPOSED HIS OWN BODY TO RECEIVE THE BLOW
7395-89880-0053 BUT THE ENEMY STRUCK HOME WITH SUCH FORCE THAT HE WOUNDED THE KING THROUGH THE BODY OF THE SLAUGHTERED THEGN BEING THEN ATTACKED ON ALL SIDES WITH SWORDS IN THE CONFUSION HE ALSO SLEW IMPIOUSLY WITH HIS DAGGER ANOTHER OF THE THEGNS WHOSE NAME WAS FORTHHERE
7395-89880-0054 THE KING IN THE PRESENCE OF BISHOP PAULINUS GAVE THANKS TO HIS GODS FOR THE BIRTH OF HIS DAUGHTER AND THE BISHOP ON HIS PART BEGAN TO GIVE THANKS TO CHRIST AND TO TELL THE KING THAT BY HIS PRAYERS TO HIM HE HAD OBTAINED THAT THE QUEEN SHOULD BRING FORTH THE CHILD IN SAFETY
7395-89880-0055 AND WITHOUT GRIEVOUS PAIN THE KING DELIGHTED WITH HIS WORDS PROMISED THAT IF GOD WOULD GRANT HIM LIFE AND VICTORY OVER THE KING BY WHOM THE MURDERER WHO HAD WOUNDED HIM HAD BEEN SENT HE WOULD RENOUNCE HIS IDOLS AND SERVE CHRIST
7395-89880-0056 AND AS A PLEDGE THAT HE WOULD PERFORM HIS PROMISE HE DELIVERED UP THAT SAME DAUGHTER TO BISHOP PAULINUS TO BE CONSECRATED TO CHRIST
7395-89880-0057 AND ENGAGING IN WAR EITHER SLEW OR RECEIVED IN SURRENDER ALL THOSE OF WHOM HE LEARNED THAT THEY HAD CONSPIRED TO MURDER HIM SO HE RETURNED VICTORIOUS INTO HIS OWN COUNTRY
7395-89880-0058 BUT HE WOULD NOT IMMEDIATELY AND UNADVISEDLY EMBRACE THE MYSTERIES OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH THOUGH HE NO LONGER WORSHIPPED IDOLS EVER SINCE HE MADE THE PROMISE THAT HE WOULD SERVE CHRIST
7395-89880-0059 BUT FIRST TOOK HEED EARNESTLY TO BE INSTRUCTED AT LEISURE BY THE VENERABLE PAULINUS IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF FAITH AND TO CONFER WITH SUCH AS HE KNEW TO BE THE WISEST OF HIS CHIEF MEN INQUIRING WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS FITTEST TO BE DONE IN THAT CASE
