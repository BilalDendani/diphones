3885-1193-0000 BUT IT SURPRISED HIM THAT OZMA ALSO KNEW IT HE WONDERED HOW SHE HAD FOUND OUT SO SOON THAT HE HAD PICKED THE SIX LEAVED CLOVER HE HANDED HIS BASKET TO SCRAPS AND SAID
3885-1193-0001 THE SHAGGY MAN HAD BEEN GAZING EARNESTLY IN THE BOY'S FACE UNCERTAIN WHETHER TO DEFEND HIM OR NOT
3885-1193-0002 THE SHAGGY MAN WAS GREATLY SURPRISED AND GRIEVED BUT HE KNEW THAT OZMA NEVER MADE MISTAKES AND SO OJO MUST REALLY HAVE BROKEN THE LAW OF OZ
3885-1193-0003 AND INTO A LITTLE ROOM BUILT IN THE WALL HERE SAT A JOLLY LITTLE MAN RICHLY DRESSED IN GREEN AND HAVING AROUND HIS NECK A HEAVY GOLD CHAIN TO WHICH A NUMBER OF GREAT GOLDEN KEYS WERE ATTACHED
3885-1193-0004 LISTEN HE SAID HOLDING UP HIS HAND FOR SILENCE
3885-1193-0005 IT'S IN PATCH TIME WHICH IS MUCH SUPERIOR TO RAG TIME AND I'VE COMPOSED IT IN HONOR OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WHO HAS JUST ARRIVED
3885-1193-0006 IT'S MY BUSINESS TO KNOW WHO'S COMING FOR I'M THE GUARDIAN OF THE GATE KEEP QUIET WHILE I PLAY YOU THE SPECKLED ALLIGATOR IT WASN'T A VERY BAD TUNE NOR A VERY GOOD ONE BUT ALL LISTENED RESPECTFULLY WHILE HE SHUT HIS EYES AND SWAYED HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE
3885-1193-0007 WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS SAID GUARDIAN I HAVE HERE A PRISONER GOOD GRACIOUS A PRISONER CRIED THE LITTLE MAN JUMPING UP FROM HIS CHAIR WHICH ONE NOT THE SHAGGY MAN NO THIS BOY
3885-1193-0008 AH I HOPE HIS FAULT IS AS SMALL AS HIMSELF SAID THE GUARDIAN OF THE GATE BUT WHAT CAN HE HAVE DONE AND WHAT MADE HIM DO IT CAN'T SAY REPLIED THE SOLDIER ALL I KNOW IS THAT HE HAS BROKEN THE LAW
3885-1193-0009 IN THIS ATTIRE THE BOY PRESENTED A VERY QUAINT APPEARANCE
3885-1193-0010 THE SHAGGY MAN SAID TO SCRAPS I THINK I SHALL TAKE YOU DIRECTLY TO DOROTHY AS THE SCARECROW ADVISED AND THE GLASS CAT AND THE WOOZY MAY COME WITH US
3885-1193-0011 ASKED SCRAPS THAT I CANNOT TELL SINCE I CAME TO THE LAND OF OZ NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN ARRESTED OR IMPRISONED UNTIL OJO BROKE THE LAW
3885-1193-0012 THE SHAGGY MAN MADE NO REPLY TO THIS SPEECH
3885-1193-0013 THEY SOON SEPARATED FROM THE MUNCHKIN BOY WHO WAS LED BY THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS DOWN A SIDE STREET TOWARD THE PRISON
3885-1193-0014 BUT THAT DID NOT ALTER THE FACT THAT HE HAD COMMITTED A FAULT
3885-1193-0015 BUT THE MORE HE THOUGHT ABOUT THE UNJUST TREATMENT HE HAD RECEIVED UNJUST MERELY BECAUSE HE CONSIDERED IT SO THE MORE HE RESENTED HIS ARREST BLAMING OZMA FOR MAKING FOOLISH LAWS AND THEN PUNISHING FOLKS WHO BROKE THEM ONLY A SIX LEAVED CLOVER
3885-1193-0016 A TINY GREEN PLANT GROWING NEGLECTED AND TRAMPLED UNDER FOOT WHAT HARM COULD THERE BE IN PICKING IT OJO BEGAN TO THINK OZMA MUST BE A VERY BAD AND OPPRESSIVE RULER FOR SUCH A LOVELY FAIRYLAND AS OZ
3885-1193-0017 BUT HOW COULD THEY THE LITTLE MUNCHKIN BOY WAS SO BUSY THINKING THESE THINGS
3885-1193-0018 WHENEVER THEY MET ANY OF THE HAPPY SMILING PEOPLE
3885-1193-0019 IT WAS A PRETTY HOUSE NEATLY PAINTED AND WITH MANY WINDOWS BEFORE IT WAS A GARDEN FILLED WITH BLOOMING FLOWERS THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS LED OJO UP THE GRAVEL PATH TO THE FRONT DOOR ON WHICH HE KNOCKED
3885-1193-0020 GOODNESS ME A PRISONER AT LAST
3885-1193-0021 THE SIZE DOESN'T MATTER TOLLYDIGGLE MY DEAR THE FACT REMAINS THAT HE IS A PRISONER SAID THE SOLDIER AND THIS BEING THE PRISON
3885-1193-0022 COME IN THEN AND I'LL GIVE YOU A RECEIPT FOR HIM
3885-1193-0023 THE BOY ON HIS PART WAS GAZING AROUND HIM IN AMAZEMENT FOR NEVER HAD HE DREAMED OF SUCH A MAGNIFICENT APARTMENT AS THIS IN WHICH HE STOOD
3885-1193-0024 IN ONE PLACE A CASE FILLED WITH BOOKS
3885-1193-0025 ASKED THE BOY PLEADINGLY WHY THIS IS YOUR PRISON REPLIED TOLLYDIGGLE AND IN ME BEHOLD YOUR JAILOR TAKE OFF THOSE HANDCUFFS SOLDIER FOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO ESCAPE FROM THIS HOUSE
3885-1193-0026 AND SPREAD A CLOTH ON ONE OF THE TABLES
3885-1193-0027 TOLLYDIGGLE SAT NEAR HIM WHILE HE ATE SEWING ON SOME FANCY WORK SHE HELD IN HER LAP
3885-1193-0028 IS THIS REALLY A PRISON HE ASKED WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED READING INDEED IT IS SHE REPLIED
3885-1193-0029 BLESS THE CHILD OF COURSE THEN WHY IS THE PRISON SO FINE AND WHY ARE YOU SO KIND TO ME HE EARNESTLY ASKED
3885-1193-0030 HE IS UNFORTUNATE IN TWO WAYS BECAUSE HE HAS DONE SOMETHING WRONG AND BECAUSE HE IS DEPRIVED OF HIS LIBERTY
3885-1193-0031 THEREFORE SHE PUTS HIM IN PRISON TO MAKE HIM STRONG AND BRAVE WHEN THAT IS ACCOMPLISHED HE IS NO LONGER A PRISONER BUT A GOOD AND LOYAL CITIZEN AND EVERYONE IS GLAD THAT HE IS NOW STRONG ENOUGH TO RESIST DOING WRONG
3885-1193-0032 OJO THOUGHT THIS OVER VERY CAREFULLY I HAD AN IDEA SAID HE THAT PRISONERS WERE ALWAYS TREATED HARSHLY TO PUNISH THEM
