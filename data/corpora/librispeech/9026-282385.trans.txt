9026-282385-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN LIFE AT THE MINES
9026-282385-0001 THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF WORK TO BE DONE IN THE MINING COUNTRY AND MEN WERE IN HIGH DEMAND THE ORDINARY WAGE WAS TEN DOLLARS A DAY AND MEN WHO COULD BE TRUSTED AND WHO WERE BRAVE ENOUGH TO PACK THE GOLD OUT TO THE COAST RECEIVED TWENTY
9026-282385-0002 AND EVEN AS HIGH AS FIFTY DOLLARS A DAY THERE IS A LETTER WRITTEN BY SIR MATTHEW BEGBIE DESCRIBING HOW THE MOUNTAIN TRAILS WERE INFESTED THAT WINTER BY DESPERADOES LYING IN WAIT FOR THE MINERS WHO CAME STAGGERING OVER THE TRAIL
9026-282385-0003 LITERALLY WEIGHTED DOWN WITH GOLD THE MINERS FOUND WHAT THE GREAT BANKS HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THAT THE PRESENCE OF UNUSED GOLD IS A NUISANCE AND A CURSE THEY HAD TO LUG THE GOLD IN LEATHER SACKS WITH THEM TO THEIR WORK
9026-282385-0004 AND BACK WITH THEM TO THEIR SHACKS AND THEY ALWAYS CARRIED FIREARMS READY FOR USE THERE WAS VERY LITTLE SHOOTING AT THE MINES BUT IF A BAD MAN TURNED UP MISSING
9026-282385-0005 OR WHETHER HE HUNG AS A SIGN OF WARNING FROM A POLE SET HORIZONTALLY AT A PROPER HEIGHT BETWEEN TWO TREES IN A MINING CAMP THERE IS NO MERCY FOR THE CROOK
9026-282385-0006 WASHED UP ON THE BARS OF SNEAK THIEVES GIVEN THIRTY NINE LASHES AND LIKE THE SCAPEGOAT TURNED OUT INTO THE MOUNTAIN WILDS A ROUGH AND READY JUSTICE ADMINISTERED WITHOUT JUDGE OR JURY BUT A WOMAN WAS AS SAFE ON THE TRAIL AS IN HER OWN HOME
9026-282385-0007 A THING THAT CIVILIZATION NEVER UNDERSTANDS ABOUT A WILD MINING CAMP MISSUS CAMERON WIFE OF THE FAMOUS CARIBOO CAMERON LIVED WITH HER HUSBAND ON HIS CLAIM TILL SHE DIED AND MANY OTHER WOMEN LIVED IN THE CAMPS WITH THEIR HUSBANDS
9026-282385-0008 WHEN THE ROAD OPENED THERE WAS A RUSH OF HURDY GURDY GIRLS FOR DANCE HALLS BUT THAT DID NOT MODIFY THE ROUGH CHIVALRY OF AN UNWRITTEN LAW THESE HURDY GURDY GIRLS WHO TIPTOED TO THE CONCERTINA THE FIDDLE AND THE HAND ORGAN
9026-282385-0009 WERE GERMAN AND IF WE MAY BELIEVE THE POET OF CARIBOO THEY WERE SOMETHING LIKE THE GLASGOW GIRLS DESCRIBED BY WOLFE AS COLD TO EVERYTHING BUT A BAGPIPE I WRONG THEM
9026-282385-0010 SINGS THE POET OF CARIBOO THEY DANCED A NICHT IN DRESSES LICHT FRA LATE UNTIL THE EARLY O BUT O THEIR HEARTS WERE HARD AS FLINT WHICH VEXED THE LADDIES SAIRLY O
9026-282385-0011 THE DOLLAR WAS THEIR ONLY LOVE AND THAT THEY LOVED FU DEARLY O THEY DINNA CARE A FLEA FOR MEN LET THEM COURT HOOE'ER SINCERELY O CARIBOO WAS WHAT THE MINERS CALL A HE CAMP
9026-282385-0012 NOT UNNATURALLY THE SHE CAMPS HEARD THE CALL FROM MACEDONIA THE BISHOP OF OXFORD THE BISHOP OF LONDON THE LORD MAYOR OF LONDON AND A COLONIAL SOCIETY IN ENGLAND GATHERED UP SOME INDUSTRIOUS YOUNG WOMEN
9026-282385-0013 AS SUITABLE WIVES FOR THE BRITISH COLUMBIA MINERS ALACK THE DAY THERE WAS NO POET TO SEND LETTERS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD ON THIS HANDLING OF CUPID'S BOW AND ARROW THE COMEDY WAS PUSHED IN THE MOST BUSINESS LIKE FASHION
9026-282385-0014 THREESCORE YOUNG GIRLS CAME OUT UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE SOCIETY AND THE CHURCH CAREFULLY SHEPHERDED BY A CLERGYMAN AND A STERN MATRON THEY REACHED VICTORIA IN SEPTEMBER OF SIXTY TWO AND WERE HOUSED IN THE BARRACKS
9026-282385-0015 AND WHEN THE GIRLS PASSED TO AND FROM THEIR TEMPORARY LODGING THEIR PROGRESS WAS LIKE A ROYAL PROCESSION THROUGH A SILENT GAPING BUT MOST RESPECTFUL LANE OF WHISKERED FACES A MAN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT RESPECT WOULD HAVE BEEN KNOCKED DOWN ON THE SPOT
9026-282385-0016 WE LAUGH NOW VICTORIA DID NOT LAUGH THEN IT WAS ALL TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY
9026-282385-0017 ON THE INSTANT EVERY GIRL WAS OFFERED SOME KIND OF SITUATION WHICH SHE VOLUNTARILY AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY EXCHANGED FOR MATRIMONY IN ALL SOME NINETY GIRLS CAME OUT UNDER THESE AUSPICES IN SIXTY TWO
9026-282385-0018 THE RESPECTABLE GIRLS FITTED IN WHERE THEY BELONGED THE DISREPUTABLE ALSO FOUND THEIR OWN PLACES AND THE MINING CAMP BEGAN TO TAKE ON AN APPEARANCE OF DOMESTICITY AND HOME MATTHEW BEGBIE
9026-282385-0019 LATER LIKE DOUGLAS GIVEN A TITLE FOR HIS SERVICES TO THE EMPIRE HAD AS WE HAVE SEEN FIRST COME OUT UNDER DIRECT APPOINTMENT BY THE CROWN AND WHEN PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT WAS ORGANIZED IN BRITISH COLUMBIA HIS POSITION WAS CONFIRMED AS CHIEF JUSTICE
9026-282385-0020 HE HAD LESS REGARD FOR RED TAPE THAN MOST CHIEF JUSTICES LIKE DOUGLAS HE FIRST MAINTAINED LAW AND ORDER AND THEN LOOKED UP TO SEE IF HE HAD ANY AUTHORITY FOR IT
9026-282385-0021 HE STOOD FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE POOREST MINER IN PRIVATE LIFE HE WAS FOND OF MUSIC ART AND LITERATURE BUT IN PUBLIC LIFE HE WAS AUTOCRATIC AS A CZAR AND STERNLY RIGHTEOUS AS A PROPHET
9026-282385-0022 HE WAS A VIGILANCE COMMITTEE IN HIMSELF THROUGH SHEER FORCE OF PERSONALITY CRIME DID NOT FLOURISH WHERE BEGBIE WENT CHINAMAN OR INDIAN COULD BE AS SURE OF JUSTICE AS THE RICHEST MINER IN CARIBOO
9026-282385-0023 FROM HATING AND FEARING HIM THE CAMP CAME ALMOST TO WORSHIP HIM MANY ARE THE STORIES OF HIS CIRCUITS ONCE A JURY PERSISTED IN BRINGING IN A VERDICT OF MANSLAUGHTER IN PLACE OF MURDER PRISONER
9026-282385-0024 THUNDERED BEGBIE IT IS NOT A PLEASANT DUTY TO ME TO SENTENCE YOU ONLY TO PRISON FOR LIFE YOU DESERVE TO BE HANGED HAD THE JURY PERFORMED THEIR DUTY I MIGHT HAVE THE PAINFUL SATISFACTION OF CONDEMNING YOU TO DEATH
9026-282385-0025 YOU GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY PERMIT ME TO SAY THAT IT WOULD GIVE ME GREAT PLEASURE TO SENTENCE YOU TO BE HANGED EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU FOR BRINGING IN A MURDERER GUILTY ONLY OF MANSLAUGHTER

9026-282385-0028 WHEN BEGBIE CAME MISTER ALEXANDER ONE OF THE OVERLANDERS OF SIXTY TWO TELLS HOW BEGBIE'S DECISIONS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN GOOD LAW BUT THEY WERE FIRST CLASS JUSTICE HIS DOCTRINE WAS THAT IF A MAN WERE KILLED
9026-282385-0029 SOME ONE HAD TO BE HANGED FOR IT AND THE EFFECT WAS SALUTARY A MAN HAD BEEN SANDBAGGED IN A VICTORIA SALOON AND THROWN OUT TO DIE HIS COMPANION IN THE SALOON WAS ARRESTED AND TRIED THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE WAS STRONG
9026-282385-0030 AND THE JUDGE SO CHARGED THE JURY BUT THE JURY ACQUITTED THE PRISONER DEAD SILENCE FELL IN THE COURT ROOM THE PRISONER'S COUNSEL AROSE AND REQUESTED THE DISCHARGE OF THE MAN BEGBIE WHIRLED PRISONER AT THE BAR
9026-282385-0031 THE JURY HAVE SAID YOU ARE NOT GUILTY YOU CAN GO AND I DEVOUTLY HOPE THE NEXT MAN YOU SANDBAG WILL BE ONE OF THE JURY ON ANOTHER OCCASION A MAN WAS FOUND STABBED ON THE CARIBOO ROAD
9026-282385-0032 TRIED AND IN SPITE OF STRONG EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM ACQUITTED BEGBIE ADJOURNED THE COURT WITH THE PIOUS WISH THAT THE MURDERER SHOULD GO OUT AND CUT THE THROATS OF THE JURY BUT
9026-282385-0033 IN SPITE OF HIS HARSH MANNER TOWARDS THE WRONG DOER THE OLD MAN AS THE MINERS AFFECTIONATELY CALLED HIM KEPT LAW AND ORDER IN THE EARLY DAYS GOLD COMMISSIONERS NOT ONLY SETTLED ALL MINING DISPUTES BUT ACTED AS JUDGE AND JURY
