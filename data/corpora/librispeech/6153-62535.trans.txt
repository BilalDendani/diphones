6153-62535-0000 CHAPTER SIX CYRUS HARDING STOOD STILL WITHOUT SAYING A WORD HIS COMPANIONS SEARCHED IN THE DARKNESS ON THE WALL IN CASE THE WIND SHOULD HAVE MOVED THE LADDER AND ON THE GROUND THINKING THAT IT MIGHT HAVE FALLEN DOWN
6153-62535-0001 BUT THE LADDER HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED AS TO ASCERTAINING IF A SQUALL HAD BLOWN IT ON THE LANDING PLACE HALF WAY UP THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE IN THE DARK
6153-62535-0002 TO COME HOME AND FIND NO STAIRCASE TO GO UP TO YOUR ROOM BY THAT'S NOTHING FOR WEARY MEN TO LAUGH AT
6153-62535-0003 OH OH I BEGIN TO THINK THAT VERY CURIOUS THINGS HAPPEN IN LINCOLN ISLAND SAID PENCROFT CURIOUS REPLIED GIDEON SPILETT
6153-62535-0004 SOME ONE HAS COME DURING OUR ABSENCE TAKEN POSSESSION OF OUR DWELLING AND DRAWN UP THE LADDER
6153-62535-0005 WELL IF THERE IS ANY ONE UP THERE REPLIED PENCROFT WHO BEGAN TO LOSE PATIENCE I WILL GIVE THEM A HAIL AND THEY MUST ANSWER AND IN A STENTORIAN VOICE THE SAILOR GAVE A PROLONGED
6153-62535-0006 HALLOO WHICH WAS ECHOED AGAIN AND AGAIN FROM THE CLIFF AND ROCKS THE SETTLERS LISTENED AND THEY THOUGHT THEY HEARD A SORT OF CHUCKLING LAUGH OF WHICH THEY COULD NOT GUESS THE ORIGIN BUT NO VOICE REPLIED TO PENCROFT
6153-62535-0007 AT NOT BEING ABLE TO GET INTO HIS KITCHEN FOR THE PROVISIONS WHICH THEY HAD HAD ON THEIR EXPEDITION WERE EXHAUSTED AND THEY HAD NO MEANS OF RENEWING THEM MY FRIENDS AT LAST SAID CYRUS HARDING
6153-62535-0008 THE ONLY THING PRACTICABLE WAS TO DO AS THE ENGINEER PROPOSED TO GO TO THE CHIMNEYS
6153-62535-0009 AND WHEN TOP RECEIVED AN ORDER HE OBEYED IT WITHOUT ANY QUESTIONING
6153-62535-0010 TO SAY THAT THE SETTLERS NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR FATIGUE SLEPT WELL ON THE SANDY FLOOR OF THE CHIMNEYS WOULD NOT BE TRUE IT WAS NOT ONLY THAT THEY WERE EXTREMELY ANXIOUS TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED
6153-62535-0011 OR WHETHER ON THE CONTRARY IT WAS THE WORK OF A HUMAN BEING BUT THEY ALSO HAD VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BEDS THAT COULD NOT BE HELPED HOWEVER FOR IN SOME WAY OR OTHER AT THAT MOMENT THEIR DWELLING WAS OCCUPIED
6153-62535-0012 AND THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY ENTER IT NOW GRANITE HOUSE WAS MORE THAN THEIR DWELLING IT WAS THEIR WAREHOUSE THERE WERE ALL THE STORES BELONGING TO THE COLONY WEAPONS INSTRUMENTS TOOLS AMMUNITION PROVISIONS ET CETERA TO THINK THAT ALL THAT MIGHT BE PILLAGED
6153-62535-0013 AND THAT THE SETTLERS WOULD HAVE ALL THEIR WORK TO DO OVER AGAIN FRESH WEAPONS AND TOOLS TO MAKE WAS A SERIOUS MATTER THEIR UNEASINESS LED ONE OR OTHER OF THEM ALSO TO GO OUT EVERY FEW MINUTES TO SEE IF TOP WAS KEEPING GOOD WATCH
6153-62535-0014 WHICH BAFFLED EVEN THEIR INTELLIGENCE AND EXPERIENCE IT IS A JOKE SAID PENCROFT IT IS A TRICK SOME ONE HAS PLAYED US WELL I DON'T LIKE SUCH JOKES AND THE JOKER HAD BETTER LOOK OUT FOR HIMSELF IF HE FALLS INTO MY HANDS I CAN TELL HIM
6153-62535-0015 AS SOON AS THE FIRST GLEAM OF LIGHT APPEARED IN THE EAST THE COLONISTS SUITABLY ARMED REPAIRED TO THE BEACH UNDER GRANITE HOUSE THE RISING SUN NOW SHONE ON THE CLIFF AND THEY COULD SEE THE WINDOWS THE SHUTTERS OF WHICH WERE CLOSED THROUGH THE CURTAINS
6153-62535-0016 OF FOLIAGE ALL HERE WAS IN ORDER BUT A CRY ESCAPED THE COLONISTS WHEN THEY SAW THAT THE DOOR WHICH THEY HAD CLOSED ON THEIR DEPARTURE WAS NOW WIDE OPEN SOME ONE HAD ENTERED GRANITE HOUSE THERE COULD BE NO MORE DOUBT ABOUT THAT THE UPPER LADDER
6153-62535-0017 WHICH GENERALLY HUNG FROM THE DOOR TO THE LANDING WAS IN ITS PLACE BUT THE LOWER LADDER WAS DRAWN UP AND RAISED TO THE THRESHOLD IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE INTRUDERS HAD WISHED TO GUARD THEMSELVES AGAINST A SURPRISE PENCROFT HAILED AGAIN NO REPLY THE BEGGARS EXCLAIMED THE SAILOR
6153-62535-0018 THERE THEY ARE SLEEPING QUIETLY AS IF THEY WERE IN THEIR OWN HOUSE HALLO THERE YOU PIRATES BRIGANDS ROBBERS SONS OF JOHN BULL WHEN PENCROFT BEING A YANKEE TREATED ANY ONE TO THE EPITHET OF SON OF JOHN BULL
6153-62535-0019 HE CONSIDERED HE HAD REACHED THE LAST LIMITS OF INSULT THE SUN HAD NOW COMPLETELY RISEN AND THE WHOLE FACADE OF GRANITE HOUSE BECAME ILLUMINATED BY ITS RAYS BUT IN THE INTERIOR AS WELL AS ON THE EXTERIOR ALL WAS QUIET AND CALM
6153-62535-0020 THE SETTLERS ASKED IF GRANITE HOUSE WAS INHABITED OR NOT AND YET THE POSITION OF THE LADDER WAS SUFFICIENT TO SHOW THAT IT WAS IT WAS ALSO CERTAIN THAT THE INHABITANTS WHOEVER THEY MIGHT BE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO ESCAPE BUT HOW WERE THEY TO BE GOT AT
6153-62535-0021 HERBERT THEN THOUGHT OF FASTENING A CORD TO AN ARROW AND SHOOTING THE ARROW SO THAT IT SHOULD PASS BETWEEN THE FIRST ROUNDS OF THE LADDER WHICH HUNG FROM THE THRESHOLD BY MEANS OF THE CORD
6153-62535-0022 THEY WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO DRAW DOWN THE LADDER TO THE GROUND AND SO RE ESTABLISH THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE BEACH AND GRANITE HOUSE THERE WAS EVIDENTLY NOTHING ELSE TO BE DONE AND WITH A LITTLE SKILL THIS METHOD MIGHT SUCCEED VERY FORTUNATELY
6153-62535-0023 BOWS AND ARROWS HAD BEEN LEFT AT THE CHIMNEYS WHERE THEY ALSO FOUND A QUANTITY OF LIGHT HIBISCUS CORD
6153-62535-0024 CYRUS HARDING GIDEON SPILETT PENCROFT
6153-62535-0025 THE BOW WAS BENT THE ARROW FLEW TAKING THE CORD WITH IT AND PASSED BETWEEN THE TWO LAST ROUNDS THE OPERATION HAD SUCCEEDED HERBERT IMMEDIATELY SEIZED THE END OF THE CORD
6153-62535-0026 BUT AT THAT MOMENT WHEN HE GAVE IT A PULL TO BRING DOWN THE LADDER AN ARM THRUST SUDDENLY OUT BETWEEN THE WALL AND THE DOOR
6153-62535-0027 NO IT WAS A MONKEY A SAPAJOU AN ORANGOUTANG A BABOON A GORILLA A SAGOIN OUR DWELLING HAS BEEN INVADED BY MONKEYS WHO CLIMBED UP THE LADDER DURING OUR ABSENCE
6153-62535-0028 BUT ONE OF THE JOKERS SHALL PAY THE PENALTY FOR THE REST SO SAYING THE SAILOR RAISING HIS PIECE TOOK A RAPID AIM AT ONE OF THE MONKEYS AND FIRED ALL DISAPPEARED EXCEPT ONE WHO FELL MORTALLY WOUNDED ON THE BEACH THIS MONKEY WHICH WAS OF A LARGE SIZE
6153-62535-0029 EVIDENTLY BELONGED TO THE FIRST ORDER OF THE QUADRUMANA WHETHER THIS WAS A CHIMPANZEE AN ORANGOUTANG OR A GORILLA HE TOOK RANK AMONG THE ANTHROPOID APES WHO ARE SO CALLED FROM THEIR RESEMBLANCE TO THE HUMAN RACE
6153-62535-0030 WHY THESE APES ARE SO CUNNING RETURNED PENCROFT THEY WON'T SHOW THEMSELVES AGAIN AT THE WINDOWS AND SO WE CAN'T KILL THEM AND WHEN I THINK OF THE MISCHIEF THEY MAY DO IN THE ROOMS AND STOREHOUSE HAVE PATIENCE REPLIED HARDING
6153-62535-0031 THESE CREATURES CANNOT KEEP US LONG AT BAY I SHALL NOT BE SURE OF THAT TILL I SEE THEM DOWN HERE REPLIED THE SAILOR AND NOW CAPTAIN DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY DOZENS OF THESE FELLOWS ARE UP THERE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO REPLY TO PENCROFT AND AS FOR THE YOUNG BOY MAKING ANOTHER ATTEMPT
6153-62535-0032 THE ENGINEER'S ORDERS WERE OBEYED AND WHILE THE REPORTER AND THE LAD THE BEST MARKSMEN IN THE COLONY POSTED THEMSELVES IN A GOOD POSITION BUT OUT OF THE MONKEYS SIGHT
6153-62535-0033 IN HALF AN HOUR THE HUNTERS RETURNED WITH A FEW ROCK PIGEONS WHICH THEY ROASTED AS WELL AS THEY COULD NOT AN APE HAD APPEARED GIDEON SPILETT AND HERBERT WENT TO TAKE THEIR SHARE OF THE BREAKFAST LEAVING TOP TO WATCH UNDER THE WINDOWS
6153-62535-0034 BUT WHAT SEEMED MORE PROBABLE WAS THAT TERRIFIED BY THE DEATH OF ONE OF THEIR COMPANIONS AND FRIGHTENED BY THE NOISE OF THE FIREARMS THEY HAD RETREATED TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE OR PROBABLY EVEN INTO THE STORE ROOM
6153-62535-0035 AND WHEN THEY THOUGHT OF THE VALUABLES WHICH THIS STOREROOM CONTAINED THE PATIENCE SO MUCH RECOMMENDED BY THE ENGINEER FAST CHANGED INTO GREAT IRRITATION AND THERE CERTAINLY WAS ROOM FOR IT DECIDEDLY IT IS TOO BAD SAID THE REPORTER AND THE WORST OF IT IS
6153-62535-0036 WE MUST MEET THEM HAND TO HAND COME NOW IS THERE NO WAY OF GETTING AT THEM LET US TRY TO ENTER GRANITE HOUSE BY THE OLD OPENING AT THE LAKE REPLIED THE ENGINEER OH SHOUTED THE SAILOR AND I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT
6153-62535-0037 THIS WAS IN REALITY THE ONLY WAY BY WHICH TO PENETRATE INTO GRANITE HOUSE SO AS TO FIGHT WITH AND DRIVE OUT THE INTRUDERS THE OPENING WAS IT IS TRUE CLOSED UP WITH A WALL OF CEMENTED STONES WHICH IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO SACRIFICE
6153-62535-0038 BUT THAT COULD EASILY BE REBUILT FORTUNATELY CYRUS HARDING HAD NOT AS YET EFFECTED HIS PROJECT OF HIDING THIS OPENING BY RAISING THE WATERS OF THE LAKE FOR THE OPERATION WOULD THEN HAVE TAKEN SOME TIME
6153-62535-0039 IT WAS ALREADY PAST TWELVE O'CLOCK WHEN THE COLONISTS WELL ARMED AND PROVIDED WITH PICKS AND SPADES LEFT THE CHIMNEYS PASSED BENEATH THE WINDOWS OF GRANITE HOUSE
6153-62535-0040 AFTER TELLING TOP TO REMAIN AT HIS POST AND BEGAN TO ASCEND THE LEFT BANK OF THE MERCY SO AS TO REACH PROSPECT HEIGHTS BUT THEY HAD NOT MADE FIFTY STEPS IN THIS DIRECTION WHEN THEY HEARD THE DOG BARKING FURIOUSLY
6153-62535-0041 PERHAPS IN THEIR TERROR THEY HAD FORGOTTEN THIS WAY OF ESCAPE THE COLONISTS NOW BEING ABLE TO TAKE AIM WITHOUT DIFFICULTY FIRED SOME WOUNDED OR KILLED FELL BACK INTO THE ROOMS UTTERING PIERCING CRIES THE REST THROWING THEMSELVES OUT WERE DASHED TO PIECES IN THEIR FALL
6153-62535-0042 SO FAR AS THEY KNEW THERE WAS NOT A LIVING QUADRUMANA IN GRANITE HOUSE
6153-62535-0043 VERY STRANGE MURMURED THE ENGINEER LEAPING FIRST UP THE LADDER TAKE CARE CAPTAIN CRIED PENCROFT PERHAPS THERE ARE STILL SOME OF THESE RASCALS
6153-62535-0044 ALL HIS COMPANIONS FOLLOWED HIM AND IN A MINUTE THEY HAD ARRIVED AT THE THRESHOLD THEY SEARCHED EVERYWHERE THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE ROOMS NOR IN THE STOREHOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN RESPECTED BY THE BAND OF QUADRUMANA WELL NOW AND THE LADDER CRIED THE SAILOR
6153-62535-0045 WHO CAN THE GENTLEMAN HAVE BEEN WHO SENT US THAT DOWN
6153-62535-0046 AH THE ROBBER CRIED PENCROFT AND HATCHET IN HAND HE WAS ABOUT TO CLEAVE THE HEAD OF THE ANIMAL WHEN CYRUS HARDING SEIZED HIS ARM SAYING SPARE HIM PENCROFT PARDON THIS RASCAL YES IT WAS HE WHO THREW US THE LADDER
6153-62535-0047 AND THE ENGINEER SAID THIS IN SUCH A PECULIAR VOICE THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHETHER HE SPOKE SERIOUSLY OR NOT NEVERTHELESS
6153-62535-0048 IT WAS AN ORANGOUTANG AND AS SUCH HAD NEITHER THE FEROCITY OF THE GORILLA NOR THE STUPIDITY OF THE BABOON IT IS TO THIS FAMILY OF THE ANTHROPOID APES THAT SO MANY CHARACTERISTICS BELONG WHICH PROVE THEM TO BE POSSESSED OF AN ALMOST HUMAN INTELLIGENCE
6153-62535-0049 EMPLOYED IN HOUSES THEY CAN WAIT AT TABLE SWEEP ROOMS BRUSH CLOTHES CLEAN BOOTS HANDLE A KNIFE FORK AND SPOON PROPERLY AND EVEN DRINK WINE DOING EVERYTHING AS WELL AS THE BEST SERVANT THAT EVER WALKED UPON TWO LEGS
6153-62535-0050 THE ONE WHICH HAD BEEN SEIZED IN THE HALL OF GRANITE HOUSE WAS A GREAT FELLOW SIX FEET HIGH WITH AN ADMIRABLY POPORTIONED FRAME A BROAD CHEST HEAD OF A MODERATE SIZE
6153-62535-0051 THE FACIAL ANGLE REACHING SIXTY FIVE DEGREES ROUND SKULL PROJECTING NOSE SKIN COVERED WITH SOFT GLOSSY HAIR IN SHORT
6153-62535-0052 ARE WE GOING TO TAKE HIM AS A SERVANT
6153-62535-0053 AND I HOPE HE WILL MAKE AN EXCELLENT SERVANT ADDED HERBERT HE APPEARS YOUNG AND WILL BE EASY TO EDUCATE AND WE SHALL NOT BE OBLIGED TO USE FORCE TO SUBDUE HIM NOR DRAW HIS TEETH AS IS SOMETIMES DONE HE WILL SOON GROW FOND OF HIS MASTERS IF THEY ARE KIND TO HIM AND THEY WILL BE
6153-62535-0054 THEN APPROACHING THE ORANG WELL OLD BOY HE ASKED HOW ARE YOU THE ORANG REPLIED BY A LITTLE GRUNT WHICH DID NOT SHOW ANY ANGER YOU WISH TO JOIN THE COLONY AGAIN ASKED THE SAILOR YOU ARE GOING TO ENTER THE SERVICE OF CAPTAIN CYRUS HARDING
