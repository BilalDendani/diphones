4161-185349-0000 CHAPTER SIX IDEALISM THUS IS THE UNSPEAKABLE BUT INTELLIGIBLE AND PRACTICABLE MEANING OF THE WORLD CONVEYED TO MAN THE IMMORTAL PUPIL IN EVERY OBJECT OF SENSE
4161-185349-0001 TO THIS ONE END OF DISCIPLINE ALL PARTS OF NATURE CONSPIRE A NOBLE DOUBT PERPETUALLY SUGGESTS ITSELF WHETHER THIS END BE NOT THE FINAL CAUSE OF THE UNIVERSE AND WHETHER NATURE OUTWARDLY EXISTS
4161-185349-0002 IT IS A SUFFICIENT ACCOUNT OF THAT APPEARANCE WE CALL THE WORLD THAT GOD WILL TEACH A HUMAN MIND AND SO MAKES IT THE RECEIVER OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CONGRUENT SENSATIONS WHICH WE CALL SUN AND MOON MAN AND WOMAN
4161-185349-0003 HOUSE AND TRADE IN MY UTTER IMPOTENCE TO TEST THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE REPORT OF MY SENSES TO KNOW WHETHER THE IMPRESSIONS THEY MAKE ON ME CORRESPOND WITH OUTLYING OBJECTS WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE
4161-185349-0004 THE RELATIONS OF PARTS AND THE END OF THE WHOLE REMAINING THE SAME WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE WHETHER LAND AND SEA INTERACT AND WORLDS REVOLVE AND INTERMINGLE WITHOUT NUMBER OR END DEEP YAWNING UNDER DEEP
4161-185349-0005 AND GALAXY BALANCING GALAXY THROUGHOUT ABSOLUTE SPACE OR WHETHER WITHOUT RELATIONS OF TIME AND SPACE THE SAME APPEARANCES ARE INSCRIBED IN THE CONSTANT FAITH OF MAN
4161-185349-0006 WHETHER NATURE ENJOY A SUBSTANTIAL EXISTENCE WITHOUT OR IS ONLY IN THE APOCALYPSE OF THE MIND IT IS ALIKE USEFUL AND ALIKE VENERABLE TO ME BE IT WHAT IT MAY IT IS IDEAL TO ME
4161-185349-0007 SO LONG AS I CANNOT TRY THE ACCURACY OF MY SENSES THE FRIVOLOUS MAKE THEMSELVES MERRY WITH THE IDEAL THEORY IF ITS CONSEQUENCES WERE BURLESQUE AS IF IT AFFECTED THE STABILITY OF NATURE IT SURELY DOES NOT
4161-185349-0008 GOD NEVER JESTS WITH US AND WILL NOT COMPROMISE THE END OF NATURE BY PERMITTING ANY INCONSEQUENCE IN ITS PROCESSION ANY DISTRUST OF THE PERMANENCE OF LAWS WOULD PARALYZE THE FACULTIES OF MAN
4161-185349-0009 THEIR PERMANENCE IS SACREDLY RESPECTED AND HIS FAITH THEREIN IS PERFECT THE WHEELS AND SPRINGS OF MAN ARE ALL SET TO THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE PERMANENCE OF NATURE WE ARE NOT BUILT LIKE A SHIP TO BE TOSSED
4161-185349-0010 BUT LIKE A HOUSE TO STAND IT IS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THIS STRUCTURE THAT SO LONG AS THE ACTIVE POWERS PREDOMINATE OVER THE REFLECTIVE
4161-185349-0011 WE RESIST WITH INDIGNATION ANY HINT THAT NATURE IS MORE SHORT LIVED OR MUTABLE THAN SPIRIT THE BROKER THE WHEELWRIGHT THE CARPENTER THE TOLL MAN ARE MUCH DISPLEASED AT THE INTIMATION
4161-185349-0012 BUT WHILST WE ACQUIESCE ENTIRELY IN THE PERMANENCE OF NATURAL LAWS THE QUESTION OF THE ABSOLUTE EXISTENCE OF NATURE STILL REMAINS OPEN IT IS THE UNIFORM EFFECT OF CULTURE ON THE HUMAN MIND
4161-185349-0013 NOT TO SHAKE OUR FAITH IN THE STABILITY OF PARTICULAR PHENOMENA AS OF HEAT WATER AZOTE BUT TO LEAD US TO REGARD NATURE AS A PHENOMENON NOT A SUBSTANCE TO ATTRIBUTE NECESSARY EXISTENCE TO SPIRIT
4161-185349-0014 TO ESTEEM NATURE AS AN ACCIDENT AND AN EFFECT TO THE SENSES AND THE UNRENEWED UNDERSTANDING BELONGS A SORT OF INSTINCTIVE BELIEF IN THE ABSOLUTE EXISTENCE OF NATURE IN THEIR VIEW
4161-185349-0015 MAN AND NATURE ARE INDISSOLUBLY JOINED THINGS ARE ULTIMATES AND THEY NEVER LOOK BEYOND THEIR SPHERE THE PRESENCE OF REASON MARS THIS FAITH
4161-185349-0016 AND SHOWS US NATURE ALOOF AND AS IT WERE AFLOAT UNTIL THIS HIGHER AGENCY INTERVENED THE ANIMAL EYE SEES WITH WONDERFUL ACCURACY SHARP OUTLINES AND COLORED SURFACES
4161-185349-0017 WHEN THE EYE OF REASON OPENS TO OUTLINE AND SURFACE ARE AT ONCE ADDED GRACE AND EXPRESSION THESE PROCEED FROM IMAGINATION AND AFFECTION AND ABATE SOMEWHAT OF THE ANGULAR DISTINCTNESS OF OBJECTS
4161-185349-0018 IF THE REASON BE STIMULATED TO MORE EARNEST VISION OUTLINES AND SURFACES BECOME TRANSPARENT AND ARE NO LONGER SEEN CAUSES AND SPIRITS ARE SEEN THROUGH THEM
4161-185349-0019 THE BEST MOMENTS OF LIFE ARE THESE DELICIOUS AWAKENINGS OF THE HIGHER POWERS AND THE REVERENTIAL WITHDRAWING OF NATURE BEFORE ITS GOD LET US PROCEED TO INDICATE THE EFFECTS OF CULTURE ONE
4161-185349-0020 OUR FIRST INSTITUTION IN THE IDEAL PHILOSOPHY IS A HINT FROM NATURE HERSELF NATURE IS MADE TO CONSPIRE WITH SPIRIT TO EMANCIPATE US CERTAIN MECHANICAL CHANGES
4161-185349-0021 A SMALL ALTERATION IN OUR LOCAL POSITION APPRIZES US OF A DUALISM WE ARE STRANGELY AFFECTED BY SEEING THE SHORE FROM A MOVING SHIP FROM A BALLOON OR THROUGH THE TINTS OF AN UNUSUAL SKY
4161-185349-0022 A MAN WHO SELDOM RIDES NEEDS ONLY TO GET INTO A COACH AND TRAVERSE HIS OWN TOWN TO TURN THE STREET INTO A PUPPET SHOW THE MEN THE WOMEN TALKING RUNNING BARTERING FIGHTING THE EARNEST MECHANIC
4161-185349-0023 THE LOUNGER THE BEGGAR THE BOYS THE DOGS ARE UNREALIZED AT ONCE OR AT LEAST WHOLLY DETACHED FROM ALL RELATION TO THE OBSERVER AND SEEN AS APPARENT NOT SUBSTANTIAL BEINGS
4161-185349-0024 WHAT NEW THOUGHTS ARE SUGGESTED BY SEEING A FACE OF COUNTRY QUITE FAMILIAR IN THE RAPID MOVEMENT OF THE RAIL ROAD CAR NAY THE MOST WONTED OBJECTS MAKE A VERY SLIGHT CHANGE IN THE POINT OF VISION PLEASE US MOST
4161-185349-0025 THE BUTCHER'S CART AND THE FIGURE OF ONE OF OUR OWN FAMILY AMUSE US SO A PORTRAIT OF A WELL KNOWN FACE GRATIFIES US TURN THE EYES UPSIDE DOWN BY LOOKING AT THE LANDSCAPE THROUGH YOUR LEGS AND HOW AGREEABLE IS THE PICTURE
4161-185349-0026 ANY TIME THESE TWENTY YEARS IN THESE CASES BY MECHANICAL MEANS IS SUGGESTED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OBSERVER AND THE SPECTACLE BETWEEN MAN AND NATURE HENCE ARISES A PLEASURE MIXED WITH AWE
4161-185349-0027 I MAY SAY A LOW DEGREE OF THE SUBLIME IS FELT FROM THE FACT PROBABLY THAT MAN IS HEREBY APPRIZED THAT WHILST THE WORLD IS A SPECTACLE SOMETHING IN HIMSELF IS STABLE TWO
4161-185349-0028 IN A HIGHER MANNER THE POET COMMUNICATES THE SAME PLEASURE
4161-185349-0029 THE SUN THE MOUNTAIN THE CAMP THE CITY THE HERO THE MAIDEN NOT DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE KNOW THEM BUT ONLY LIFTED FROM THE GROUND AND AFLOAT BEFORE THE EYE HE UNFIXES THE LAND AND THE SEA
4161-185349-0030 MAKES THEM REVOLVE AROUND THE AXIS OF HIS PRIMARY THOUGHT AND DISPOSES THEM ANEW POSSESSED HIMSELF BY A HEROIC PASSION HE USES MATTER AS SYMBOLS OF IT THE SENSUAL MAN CONFORMS THOUGHTS TO THINGS
4161-185349-0031 THE POET CONFORMS THINGS TO HIS THOUGHTS THE ONE ESTEEMS NATURE AS ROOTED AND FAST THE OTHER AS FLUID AND IMPRESSES HIS BEING THEREON TO HIM
4161-185349-0032 THE REFRACTORY WORLD IS DUCTILE AND FLEXIBLE HE INVESTS DUST AND STONES WITH HUMANITY AND MAKES THEM THE WORDS OF THE REASON THE IMAGINATION MAY BE DEFINED TO BE THE USE WHICH THE REASON
4161-185349-0033 MAKES OF THE MATERIAL WORLD SHAKSPEARE POSSESSES THE POWER OF SUBORDINATING NATURE FOR THE PURPOSES OF EXPRESSION BEYOND ALL POETS HIS IMPERIAL MUSE TOSSES THE CREATION LIKE A BAUBLE FROM HAND TO HAND
4161-185349-0034 AND USES IT TO EMBODY ANY CAPRICE OF THOUGHT THAT IS UPPER MOST IN HIS MIND THE REMOTEST SPACES OF NATURE ARE VISITED AND THE FARTHEST SUNDERED THINGS ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER
4161-185349-0035 WE ARE MADE AWARE THAT MAGNITUDE OF MATERIAL THINGS IS RELATIVE AND ALL OBJECTS SHRINK AND EXPAND TO SERVE THE PASSION OF THE POET THUS IN HIS SONNETS THE LAYS OF BIRDS THE SCENTS AND DYES OF FLOWERS
4161-185349-0036 HE FINDS TO BE THE SHADOW OF HIS BELOVED TIME WHICH KEEPS HER FROM HIM IS HIS CHEST THE SUSPICION SHE HAS AWAKENED IS HER ORNAMENT THE ORNAMENT OF BEAUTY IS SUSPECT
4161-185349-0037 A CROW WHICH FLIES IN HEAVEN'S SWEETEST AIR HIS PASSION IS NOT THE FRUIT OF CHANCE IT SWELLS AS HE SPEAKS TO A CITY OR A STATE NO IT WAS BUILDED FAR FROM ACCIDENT
4161-185349-0038 IT SUFFERS NOT IN SMILING POMP NOR FALLS UNDER THE BROW OF THRALLING DISCONTENT IT FEARS NOT POLICY THAT HERETIC THAT WORKS ON LEASES OF SHORT NUMBERED HOURS
4161-185349-0039 BUT ALL ALONE STANDS HUGELY POLITIC IN THE STRENGTH OF HIS CONSTANCY THE PYRAMIDS SEEM TO HIM RECENT AND TRANSITORY THE FRESHNESS OF YOUTH AND LOVE DAZZLES HIM WITH ITS RESEMBLANCE TO MORNING
4161-185349-0040 TAKE THOSE LIPS AWAY WHICH SO SWEETLY WERE FORSWORN AND THOSE EYES THE BREAK OF DAY LIGHTS THAT DO MISLEAD THE MORN
4161-185349-0041 THE WILD BEAUTY OF THIS HYPERBOLE I MAY SAY IN PASSING IT WOULD NOT BE EASY TO MATCH IN LITERATURE THIS TRANSFIGURATION WHICH ALL MATERIAL OBJECTS UNDERGO THROUGH THE PASSION OF THE POET
4161-185349-0042 THIS POWER WHICH HE EXERTS TO DWARF THE GREAT TO MAGNIFY THE SMALL MIGHT BE ILLUSTRATED BY A THOUSAND EXAMPLES FROM HIS PLAYS I HAVE BEFORE ME THE TEMPEST AND WILL CITE ONLY THESE FEW LINES ARIEL
4161-185349-0043 THE STRONG BASED PROMONTORY HAVE I MADE SHAKE AND BY THE SPURS PLUCKED UP THE PINE AND CEDAR PROSPERO CALLS FOR MUSIC TO SOOTHE THE FRANTIC ALONZO AND HIS COMPANIONS
4161-185349-0044 A SOLEMN AIR AND THE BEST COMFORTER TO AN UNSETTLED FANCY CURE THY BRAINS NOW USELESS BOILED WITHIN THY SKULL AGAIN THE CHARM DISSOLVES APACE
4161-185349-0045 AND AS THE MORNING STEALS UPON THE NIGHT MELTING THE DARKNESS SO THEIR RISING SENSES BEGIN TO CHASE THE IGNORANT FUMES THAT MANTLE THEIR CLEARER REASON THEIR UNDERSTANDING BEGINS TO SWELL
4161-185349-0046 AND THE APPROACHING TIDE WILL SHORTLY FILL THE REASONABLE SHORES THAT NOW LIE FOUL AND MUDDY THE PERCEPTION OF REAL AFFINITIES BETWEEN EVENTS THAT IS TO SAY OF IDEAL AFFINITIES FOR THOSE ONLY ARE REAL
4161-185349-0047 ENABLES THE POET THUS TO MAKE FREE WITH THE MOST IMPOSING FORMS AND PHENOMENA OF THE WORLD AND TO ASSERT THE PREDOMINANCE OF THE SOUL THREE
4161-185349-0048 THAT THE ONE PROPOSES BEAUTY AS HIS MAIN END THE OTHER TRUTH BUT THE PHILOSOPHER NOT LESS THAN THE POET POSTPONES THE APPARENT ORDER AND RELATIONS OF THINGS TO THE EMPIRE OF THOUGHT
4161-185349-0049 THE PROBLEM OF PHILOSOPHY ACCORDING TO PLATO IS FOR ALL THAT EXISTS CONDITIONALLY TO FIND A GROUND UNCONDITIONED AND ABSOLUTE IT PROCEEDS ON THE FAITH THAT A LAW DETERMINES ALL PHENOMENA
4161-185349-0050 WHICH BEING KNOWN THE PHENOMENA CAN BE PREDICTED THAT LAW WHEN IN THE MIND IS AN IDEA ITS BEAUTY IS INFINITE THE TRUE PHILOSOPHER AND THE TRUE POET ARE ONE
4161-185349-0051 AND A BEAUTY WHICH IS TRUTH AND A TRUTH WHICH IS BEAUTY IS THE AIM OF BOTH IS NOT THE CHARM OF ONE OF PLATO'S OR ARISTOTLE'S DEFINITIONS STRICTLY LIKE THAT OF THE ANTIGONE OF SOPHOCLES
4161-185349-0052 IT IS IN BOTH CASES THAT A SPIRITUAL LIFE HAS BEEN IMPARTED TO NATURE THAT THE SOLID SEEMING BLOCK OF MATTER HAS BEEN PERVADED AND DISSOLVED BY A THOUGHT
4161-185349-0053 THAT THIS FEEBLE HUMAN BEING HAS PENETRATED THE VAST MASSES OF NATURE WITH AN INFORMING SOUL AND RECOGNISED ITSELF IN THEIR HARMONY THAT IS SEIZED THEIR LAW
4161-185349-0054 IN PHYSICS WHEN THIS IS ATTAINED THE MEMORY DISBURTHENS ITSELF OF ITS CUMBROUS CATALOGUES OF PARTICULARS AND CARRIES CENTURIES OF OBSERVATION IN A SINGLE FORMULA THUS EVEN IN PHYSICS
4161-185349-0055 THE MATERIAL IS DEGRADED BEFORE THE SPIRITUAL THE ASTRONOMER THE GEOMETER RELY ON THEIR IRREFRAGABLE ANALYSIS AND DISDAIN THE RESULTS OF OBSERVATION
4161-185349-0056 THIS WILL BE FOUND CONTRARY TO ALL EXPERIENCE YET IS TRUE HAD ALREADY TRANSFERRED NATURE INTO THE MIND AND LEFT MATTER LIKE AN OUTCAST CORPSE FOUR
4161-185349-0057 INTELLECTUAL SCIENCE HAS BEEN OBSERVED TO BEGET INVARIABLY A DOUBT OF THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER TURGOT SAID
4161-185349-0058 IT FASTENS THE ATTENTION UPON IMMORTAL NECESSARY UNCREATED NATURES THAT IS UPON IDEAS AND IN THEIR PRESENCE WE FEEL THAT THE OUTWARD CIRCUMSTANCE IS A DREAM AND A SHADE
4161-185349-0059 WHILST WE WAIT IN THIS OLYMPUS OF GODS WE THINK OF NATURE AS AN APPENDIX TO THE SOUL WE ASCEND INTO THEIR REGION AND KNOW THAT THESE ARE THE THOUGHTS OF THE SUPREME BEING
4161-185349-0060 THESE ARE THEY WHO WERE SET UP FROM EVERLASTING FROM THE BEGINNING OR EVER THE EARTH WAS WHEN HE PREPARED THE HEAVENS THEY WERE THERE WHEN HE ESTABLISHED THE CLOUDS ABOVE
4161-185349-0061 WHEN HE STRENGTHENED THE FOUNTAINS OF THE DEEP THEN THEY WERE BY HIM AS ONE BROUGHT UP WITH HIM OF THEM TOOK HE COUNSEL THEIR INFLUENCE IS PROPORTIONATE
4161-185349-0062 AS OBJECTS OF SCIENCE THEY ARE ACCESSIBLE TO FEW MEN YET ALL MEN ARE CAPABLE OF BEING RAISED BY PIETY OR BY PASSION INTO THEIR REGION
4161-185349-0063 AND NO MAN TOUCHES THESE DIVINE NATURES WITHOUT BECOMING IN SOME DEGREE HIMSELF DIVINE LIKE A NEW SOUL THEY RENEW THE BODY WE BECOME PHYSICALLY NIMBLE AND LIGHTSOME WE TREAD ON AIR
4161-185349-0064 LIFE IS NO LONGER IRKSOME AND WE THINK IT WILL NEVER BE SO NO MAN FEARS AGE OR MISFORTUNE OR DEATH IN THEIR SERENE COMPANY FOR HE IS TRANSPORTED OUT OF THE DISTRICT OF CHANGE
4161-185349-0065 WHILST WE BEHOLD UNVEILED THE NATURE OF JUSTICE AND TRUTH WE LEARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ABSOLUTE AND THE CONDITIONAL OR RELATIVE WE APPREHEND THE ABSOLUTE AS IT WERE FOR THE FIRST TIME
4161-185349-0066 WE EXIST WE BECOME IMMORTAL FOR WE LEARN THAT TIME AND SPACE ARE RELATIONS OF MATTER THAT WITH A PERCEPTION OF TRUTH OR A VIRTUOUS WILL THEY HAVE NO AFFINITY
4161-185349-0067 FIVE FINALLY RELIGION AND ETHICS WHICH MAY BE FITLY CALLED THE PRACTICE OF IDEAS OR THE INTRODUCTION OF IDEAS INTO LIFE HAVE AN ANALOGOUS EFFECT
4161-185349-0068 WITH ALL LOWER CULTURE IN DEGRADING NATURE AND SUGGESTING ITS DEPENDENCE ON SPIRIT ETHICS AND RELIGION DIFFER HEREIN THAT THE ONE IS THE SYSTEM OF HUMAN DUTIES COMMENCING FROM MAN
4161-185349-0069 THE OTHER FROM GOD RELIGION INCLUDES THE PERSONALITY OF GOD ETHICS DOES NOT THEY ARE ONE TO OUR PRESENT DESIGN THEY BOTH PUT NATURE UNDER FOOT
4161-185349-0070 THE FIRST AND LAST LESSON OF RELIGION IS THE THINGS THAT ARE SEEN ARE TEMPORAL THE THINGS THAT ARE UNSEEN ARE ETERNAL IT PUTS AN AFFRONT UPON NATURE IT DOES THAT FOR THE UNSCHOOLED
4161-185349-0071 WHICH PHILOSOPHY DOES FOR BERKELEY AND VIASA THE UNIFORM LANGUAGE THAT MAY BE HEARD IN THE CHURCHES OF THE MOST IGNORANT SECTS IS CONTEMN THE UNSUBSTANTIAL SHOWS OF THE WORLD
4161-185349-0072 THEY ARE VANITIES DREAMS SHADOWS UNREALITIES SEEK THE REALITIES OF RELIGION THE DEVOTEE FLOUTS NATURE
4161-185349-0073 AND PLOTINUS THEY DISTRUSTED IN THEMSELVES ANY LOOKING BACK TO THESE FLESH POTS OF EGYPT PLOTINUS WAS ASHAMED OF HIS BODY IN SHORT THEY MIGHT ALL SAY OF MATTER WHAT MICHAEL ANGELO
4161-185349-0074 SAID OF EXTERNAL BEAUTY IT IS THE FRAIL AND WEARY WEED IN WHICH GOD DRESSES THE SOUL WHICH HE HAS CALLED INTO TIME IT APPEARS THAT MOTION POETRY
4161-185349-0075 PHYSICAL AND INTELLECTUAL SCIENCE AND RELIGION ALL TEND TO AFFECT OUR CONVICTIONS OF THE REALITY OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD BUT I OWN
4161-185349-0076 THERE IS SOMETHING UNGRATEFUL IN EXPANDING TOO CURIOUSLY THE PARTICULARS OF THE GENERAL PROPOSITION THAT ALL CULTURE TENDS TO IMBUE US WITH IDEALISM I HAVE NO HOSTILITY TO NATURE BUT A CHILD'S LOVE TO IT
4161-185349-0077 I EXPAND AND LIVE IN THE WARM DAY LIKE CORN AND MELONS LET US SPEAK HER FAIR I DO NOT WISH TO FLING STONES AT MY BEAUTIFUL MOTHER NOR SOIL MY GENTLE NEST
4161-185349-0078 I ONLY WISH TO INDICATE THE TRUE POSITION OF NATURE IN REGARD TO MAN WHEREIN TO ESTABLISH MAN ALL RIGHT EDUCATION TENDS AS THE GROUND WHICH TO ATTAIN IS THE OBJECT OF HUMAN LIFE THAT IS
4161-185349-0079 OF MAN'S CONNECTION WITH NATURE CULTURE INVERTS THE VULGAR VIEWS OF NATURE AND BRINGS THE MIND TO CALL THAT APPARENT WHICH IT USES TO CALL REAL AND THAT REAL
4161-185349-0080 WHICH IT USES TO CALL VISIONARY CHILDREN IT IS TRUE BELIEVE IN THE EXTERNAL WORLD THE BELIEF THAT IT APPEARS ONLY IS AN AFTERTHOUGHT BUT WITH CULTURE
4161-185349-0081 THE ADVANTAGE OF THE IDEAL THEORY OVER THE POPULAR FAITH IS THIS THAT IT PRESENTS THE WORLD IN PRECISELY THAT VIEW WHICH IS MOST DESIRABLE TO THE MIND IT IS IN FACT
4161-185349-0082 THE VIEW WHICH REASON BOTH SPECULATIVE AND PRACTICAL THAT IS PHILOSOPHY AND VIRTUE TAKE FOR SEEN IN THE LIGHT OF THOUGHT THE WORLD ALWAYS IS PHENOMENAL AND VIRTUE SUBORDINATES IT TO THE MIND
4161-185349-0083 IDEALISM SEES THE WORLD IN GOD IT BEHOLDS THE WHOLE CIRCLE OF PERSONS AND THINGS OF ACTIONS AND EVENTS OF COUNTRY AND RELIGION NOT AS PAINFULLY ACCUMULATED
4161-185349-0084 ATOM AFTER ATOM ACT AFTER ACT IN AN AGED CREEPING PAST BUT AS ONE VAST PICTURE WHICH GOD PAINTS ON THE INSTANT ETERNITY FOR THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE SOUL THEREFORE
4161-185349-0085 THE SOUL HOLDS ITSELF OFF FROM A TOO TRIVIAL AND MICROSCOPIC STUDY OF THE UNIVERSAL TABLET IT RESPECTS THE END TOO MUCH TO IMMERSE ITSELF IN THE MEANS IT SEES SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT IN CHRISTIANITY
4161-185349-0086 THAN THE SCANDALS OF ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY OR THE NICETIES OF CRITICISM AND VERY INCURIOUS CONCERNING PERSONS OR MIRACLES AND NOT AT ALL DISTURBED BY CHASMS OF HISTORICAL EVIDENCE
4161-185349-0087 IT ACCEPTS FROM GOD THE PHENOMENON AS IT FINDS IT AS THE PURE AND AWFUL FORM OF RELIGION IN THE WORLD IT IS NOT HOT AND PASSIONATE AT THE APPEARANCE OF WHAT IT CALLS ITS OWN GOOD OR BAD FORTUNE
4161-185349-0088 AT THE UNION OR OPPOSITION OF OTHER PERSONS NO MAN IS ITS ENEMY IT ACCEPTS WHATSOEVER BEFALLS AS PART OF ITS LESSON
