2194-141235-0000 THIRD PLANET OUT FROM ITS PRIMARY EPSILON ERIDANI THE FOURTH PLANET IS NYJORD
2194-141235-0001 DIS IS A PLACE YOU NEED A GOOD REASON TO VISIT AND NO REASON AT ALL TO LEAVE TOO HOT TOO DRY THE TEMPERATURE IN THE TEMPERATE ZONES RARELY DROPS BELOW A HUNDRED FAHRENHEIT THE PLANET IS NOTHING BUT SCORCHED ROCK AND BURNING SAND
2194-141235-0002 MOST OF THE WATER IS UNDERGROUND AND NORMALLY INACCESSIBLE THE SURFACE WATER IS ALL IN THE FORM OF BRINY CHEMICALLY SATURATED SWAMPS UNDRINKABLE WITHOUT EXTENSIVE PROCESSING
2194-141235-0003 ALL THE FACTS AND FIGURES ARE HERE IN THE FOLDER AND YOU CAN STUDY THEM LATER RIGHT NOW I WANT YOU JUST TO GET THE IDEA THAT THIS PLANET IS AS LOATHSOME AND INHOSPITABLE AS THEY COME SO ARE THE PEOPLE THIS IS A SOLIDO OF A DISAN
2194-141235-0004 NOT AT THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF THE MAN
2194-141235-0005 IT WAS THE MAN'S POSE THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE TENSED TO LEAP HIS LIPS DRAWN BACK TO SHOW ALL OF THIS TEETH HE LOOKS AS IF HE WANTED TO KILL THE PHOTOGRAPHER SHE SAID HE ALMOST DID JUST AFTER THE PICTURE WAS TAKEN
2194-141235-0006 LIKE ALL DISANS HE HAS AN OVERWHELMING HATRED AND LOATHING OF OFFWORLDERS NOT WITHOUT GOOD REASON THOUGH
2194-141235-0007 DURING THE BREAKDOWN I'M NOT SURE OF THE DETAILS BUT THE OVERALL PICTURE IS CLEAR SINCE THE STORY OF THEIR DESERTION FORMS THE BASIS OF ALL THE MYTHS AND ANIMISTIC RELIGIONS ON DIS APPARENTLY THERE WERE LARGE SCALE MINING OPERATIONS CARRIED ON THERE ONCE
2194-141235-0008 THE WORLD IS RICH ENOUGH IN MINERALS AND MINING THEM IS VERY SIMPLE BUT WATER CAME ONLY FROM EXPENSIVE EXTRACTION PROCESSES AND I IMAGINE MOST OF THE FOOD CAME FROM OFFWORLD
2194-141235-0009 WHICH WAS GOOD ENOUGH UNTIL THE SETTLEMENT WAS FORGOTTEN THE WAY A LOT OF OTHER PLANETS WERE DURING THE BREAKDOWN ALL THE RECORDS WERE DESTROYED IN THE FIGHTING AND THE ORE CARRIERS WERE PRESSED INTO MILITARY SERVICE DIS WAS ON ITS OWN
2194-141235-0010 WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PEOPLE THERE IS A TRIBUTE TO THE ADAPTATION POSSIBILITIES OF HOMO SAPIENS INDIVIDUALS DIED USUALLY IN ENORMOUS PAIN BUT THE RACE LIVED CHANGED A GOOD DEAL BUT STILL HUMAN
2194-141235-0011 THEY COULDN'T DO IT MECHANICALLY BUT BY THE TIME THE LAST MACHINE COLLAPSED ENOUGH PEOPLE WERE ADJUSTED TO THE ENVIRONMENT TO KEEP THE RACE GOING THEIR DESCENDANTS ARE STILL THERE COMPLETELY ADAPTED TO THE ENVIRONMENT
2194-141235-0012 THEIR BODY TEMPERATURES ARE AROUND A HUNDRED AND THIRTY DEGREES THEY HAVE SPECIALIZED TISSUE IN THE GLUTEAL AREA FOR STORING WATER THESE ARE MINOR CHANGES COMPARED TO THE MAJOR ONES THEY HAVE DONE IN FITTING THEMSELVES FOR THIS PLANET
2194-141235-0013 I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT DETAILS BUT THE REPORTS ARE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIPS
2194-141235-0014 PERHAPS FROM THE ABSTRACT SCIENTIFIC POINT OF VIEW IF YOU CAN KEEP NOTES PERHAPS YOU MIGHT WRITE A BOOK ABOUT IT SOME TIME BUT I'M NOT INTERESTED I'M SURE ALL THESE MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES AND DISGUSTING INTIMACIES WILL FASCINATE YOU DOCTOR MOREES
2194-141235-0015 BUT WHILE YOU ARE COUNTING BLOOD TYPES AND ADMIRING YOUR THERMOMETERS
2194-141235-0016 WE MUST EITHER FIND OUT WHAT MAKES THESE PEOPLE TICK OR WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO STAND BY AND WATCH THE WHOLE LOT BLOWN UP GOING TO DO WHAT LEA GASPED DESTROY THEM WIPE OUT THIS FASCINATING GENETIC POOL
2194-141235-0017 THESE ABORIGINAL HOTHEADS HAVE MANAGED TO LAY THEIR HANDS ON SOME PRIMITIVE COBALT BOMBS
2194-141235-0018 NOTHING SAID OR DONE CAN CONVINCE THEM DIFFERENTLY THEY DEMAND UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER OR ELSE
2194-141235-0019 THE DISANS ARE OUT TO COMMIT RACIAL SUICIDE A NYJORD FLEET IS NOW OVER DIS AND THE DEADLINE HAS ALMOST EXPIRED FOR THE SURRENDER OF THE COBALT BOMBS THE NYJORD SHIPS CARRY ENOUGH H BOMBS TO TURN THE ENTIRE PLANET INTO AN ATOMIC PILE
2194-141235-0020 WHAT LOOKED LIKE A PIECE OF GREEN VINE WAS HOOKED OVER ONE SHOULDER FROM A PLAITED BELT WERE SUSPENDED A NUMBER OF ODD DEVICES MADE OF HAND BEATEN METAL DRILLED STONE AND LOOPED LEATHER THE ONLY RECOGNIZABLE ITEM WAS A THIN KNIFE OF UNUSUAL DESIGN
2194-141235-0021 LOOPS OF PIPING FLARED BELLS CARVED STONES TIED IN SENSELESS PATTERNS OF THONGING GAVE THE REST OF THE COLLECTION A BIZARRE APPEARANCE PERHAPS THEY HAD SOME RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE
2194-141235-0022 IF THEY WERE USED WHAT IN THE UNIVERSE COULD THEY BE USED FOR I CAN'T BELIEVE IT HE FINALLY CONCLUDED EXCEPT FOR THE EXOTIC HARDWARE THIS LOWBROW LOOKS AS IF HE HAS SUNK BACK INTO THE STONE AGE I DON'T SEE HOW HIS KIND CAN BE ANY REAL THREAT TO ANOTHER PLANET
2194-141235-0023 SINCE THEY ARE OUR EMPLOYERS WE MUST DO WHAT THEY ASK
2194-141235-0024 DIS HAS SOME SPACERS AS WELL AS THE COBALT BOMBS THOUGH THESE AREN'T THE REAL THREAT A TRAMP TRADER WAS PICKED UP LEAVING DIS
2194-141235-0025 WHILE ESSENTIALLY A PEACEFUL AND HAPPY PEOPLE THE NYJORDERS WERE JUSTIFIABLY ANNOYED AT THIS AND CONVINCED THE TRAMP'S CAPTAIN TO GIVE THEM SOME MORE INFORMATION
2194-141235-0026 IT'S ALL HERE BOILED DOWN IT GIVES A MINIMUM DEADLINE BY WHICH TIME THE LAUNCHER CAN BE SET UP AND START THROWING BOMBS WHEN IS THAT DEADLINE LEA ASKED IN TEN MORE DAYS
2194-141235-0027 I ASSURE YOU THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT BUT THEY WILL DROP THE BOMBS IN ORDER TO ASSURE THEIR OWN SURVIVAL
2194-141235-0028 I DON'T KNOW A THING ABOUT NUCLEONICS OR JUMP SPACE I'M AN EXOBIOLOGIST WITH A SUPPLEMENTARY DEGREE IN ANTHROPOLOGY WHAT HELP COULD I POSSIBLY BE
2194-141235-0029 MY FAITH IN OUR RECRUITERS IS RESTORED HE SAID THAT'S A COMBINATION THAT IS PROBABLY RARE EVEN ON EARTH
2194-141235-0030 BUT YOUNG ENOUGH TO SURVIVE IF WE KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON YOU HE CUT OFF LEA'S ANGRY PROTEST WITH A RAISED HAND NO MORE BICKERING THERE ISN'T TIME THE NYJORDERS MUST HAVE LOST OVER THIRTY AGENTS TRYING TO FIND THE BOMBS
2194-141235-0031 OUR FOUNDATION HAS HAD SIX PEOPLE KILLED INCLUDING MY LATE PREDECESSOR IN CHARGE OF THE PROJECT HE WAS A GOOD MAN BUT I THINK HE WENT AT THIS PROBLEM THE WRONG WAY I THINK IT IS A CULTURAL ONE NOT A PHYSICAL ONE
2194-141235-0032 ALL I HEAR IS STATIC IT'S THE OLD PROBLEM OF GENESIS LIKE NEWTON AND THE FALLING APPLE LEVY AND THE HYSTERESIS IN THE WARP FIELD EVERYTHING HAS A BEGINNING IF WE CAN FIND OUT
2194-141235-0033 YOU CAN COUNT ON ME FOR COMPLETE COOPERATION
2194-141235-0034 DON'T CALL ME I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I WANT BREAKFAST BRION WASN'T SURE HOW MUCH OF HER BARBED SPEECH WAS HUMOR AND HOW MUCH WAS SERIOUS SO HE SAID NOTHING HE SHOWED HER TO AN EMPTY CABIN SHE DID LOCK THE DOOR
2194-141235-0035 THE WINNER WAS IN THE GALLEY ADDING TO HIS GIRTH WITH AN IMMENSE GELATIN DESSERT THAT FILLED A GOOD SIZED TUREEN
2194-141235-0036 THE TOP OF HER HEAD IS BELOW MY CHIN THAT'S THE NORM EARTH IS A RESERVOIR OF TIRED GENES WEAK BACKS VERMIFORM APPENDIXES BAD EYES IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE UNIVERSITIES AND THE TRAINED PEOPLE WE NEED I WOULD NEVER USE THEM
2194-141235-0037 WHY DID YOU LIE TO HER ABOUT THE FOUNDATION BECAUSE IT'S A SECRET ISN'T THAT REASON ENOUGH IHJEL RUMBLED ANGRILY SCRAPING THE LAST DREGS FROM THE BOWL BETTER EAT SOMETHING BUILD UP THE STRENGTH
2194-141235-0038 BUT I DOUBT IF SHE WILL LIKE THE WAY WE OPERATE PARTICULARLY SINCE I PLAN TO DROP SOME H BOMBS ON DIS MYSELF IF WE CAN'T TURN OFF THE WAR I DON'T BELIEVE IT YOU HEARD ME CORRECTLY DON'T BULGE YOUR EYES AND LOOK MORONIC
2194-141235-0039 AS A LAST RESORT I'LL DROP THE BOMBS MYSELF RATHER THAN LET THE NYJORDERS DO IT THAT MIGHT SAVE THEM
2194-141235-0040 NOT THE DISANS I WANT TO SAVE THE NYJORDERS STOP CLENCHING YOUR FISTS AND SIT DOWN AND HAVE SOME OF THIS CAKE IT'S DELICIOUS THE NYJORDERS ARE ALL THAT COUNTS HERE THEY HAVE A PLANET BLESSED BY THE LAWS OF CHANCE
2194-141235-0041 NOT MECHANICAL THEY WEREN'T EVEN USING THE WHEEL WHEN THEY WERE REDISCOVERED THEY BECAME SORT OF CULTURAL SPECIALISTS DIGGING DEEP INTO THE PHILOSOPHICAL ASPECTS OF INTERRELATIONSHIP
2194-141235-0042 NOT GUIDING SO MUCH AS PROTECTING THEM FROM ANY BLOWS THAT MIGHT DESTROY THIS GROWING IDEA BUT WE'VE FALLEN DOWN ON THE JOB NONVIOLENCE IS ESSENTIAL TO THESE PEOPLE
2194-141235-0043 THEY HAVE VITALITY WITHOUT NEEDING DESTRUCTION BUT IF THEY ARE FORCED TO BLOW UP DIS FOR THEIR OWN SURVIVAL AGAINST EVERY ONE OF THEIR BASIC TENETS THEIR PHILOSOPHY WON'T ENDURE
2194-141235-0044 THAT MAY SOME DAY FORM THE KEY TO MANKIND'S SURVIVAL THEY ARE WORTH LOOKING AFTER NOW GET BELOW AND STUDY YOUR DISAN AND READ THE REPORTS
