6627-67844-0000 I THINK IT IS A LOVELY SONG SAID SYLVIA I'LL TELL MY MOTHER ABOUT IT I AM SO GLAD YOU TOLD ME GRACE SYLVIA FULTON WAS TEN YEARS OLD AND HAD LIVED IN CHARLESTON SOUTH CAROLINA FOR THE PAST YEAR BEFORE THAT THE FULTONS HAD LIVED IN BOSTON
6627-67844-0001 GRACE WAITE LIVED IN THE HOUSE NEXT TO THE ONE WHICH MISTER FULTON HAD HIRED IN THE BEAUTIFUL SOUTHERN CITY AND THE TWO LITTLE GIRLS HAD BECOME FAST FRIENDS THEY BOTH ATTENDED MISS PATTEN'S SCHOOL USUALLY GRACE'S BLACK MAMMY ESTHER ESCORTED THEM TO AND FROM MISS PATTEN'S
6627-67844-0002 BUT ON THIS MORNING IN EARLY OCTOBER THEY WERE ALLOWED TO GO BY THEMSELVES AS THEY WALKED ALONG THEY COULD LOOK OUT ACROSS THE BLUE HARBOR AND SEE SAILING VESSELS AND ROWBOATS COMING AND GOING IN THE DISTANCE WERE THE THREE FORTS WHOSE HISTORIC NAMES WERE KNOWN TO EVERY CHILD IN CHARLESTON
6627-67844-0003 GRACE NEVER FAILED TO POINT THEM OUT TO THE LITTLE NORTHERN GIRL AND TO REPEAT THEIR NAMES CASTLE PINCKNEY SHE WOULD SAY POINTING TO THE ONE NEAREST THE CITY
6627-67844-0004 FORT SUMTER AND FORT MOULTRIE DON'T STOP TO TELL ME THE NAMES OF THOSE OLD FORTS THIS MORNING SAID SYLVIA I KNOW JUST AS MUCH ABOUT THEM NOW AS YOU DO WE SHALL BE LATE IF WE DON'T HURRY MISS PATTEN'S HOUSE STOOD IN A BIG GARDEN WHICH RAN NEARLY TO THE WATER'S EDGE
6627-67844-0005 THE SCHOOLROOM OPENED ON EACH SIDE TO BROAD PIAZZAS AND THERE WAS ALWAYS THE PLEASANT FRAGRANCE OF FLOWERS IN THE BIG AIRY ROOM SYLVIA WAS SURE THAT NO ONE COULD BE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN MISS PATTEN SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE ONE OF THE LADIES IN YOUR GODEY'S MAGAZINE
6627-67844-0006 AND WITH HER PRETTY SOFT BLACK CURLS HER ROSY CHEEKS AND PLEASANT VOICE NO ONE COULD IMAGINE A MORE DESIRABLE TEACHER THAN MISS ROSALIE PATTTEN THERE WERE JUST TWELVE LITTLE GIRLS IN HER SCHOOL THERE WERE NEVER TEN OR FOURTEEN
6627-67844-0007 MISS PATTEN WOULD NEVER ENGAGE TO TAKE MORE THAN TWELVE PUPILS AND THE TWELVE ALWAYS CAME
6627-67844-0008 SCHOOL HAD OPENED THE PREVIOUS WEEK AND SYLVIA HAD BEGUN TO FEEL QUITE AT HOME WITH HER NEW SCHOOLMATES THE WINTER BEFORE MISSUS FULTON HAD TAUGHT HER LITTLE DAUGHTER AT HOME
6627-67844-0009 MISS PATTEN ALWAYS STOOD NEAR THE SCHOOLROOM DOOR UNTIL ALL HER PUPILS HAD ARRIVED AS EACH GIRL ENTERED THE ROOM SHE MADE A CURTSEY TO THE PRETTY TEACHER AND THEN SAID GOOD MORNING TO THE PUPILS WHO HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AND TOOK HER SEAT
6627-67844-0010 THEN THE PUPILS WERE READY FOR THEIR LESSONS ISN'T MISS ROSALIE LOVELY SYLVIA WHISPERED AS SHE AND GRACE MOVED TO THEIR SEATS AND DOESN'T SHE WEAR PRETTY CLOTHES GRACE NODDED SHE HAD BEEN TO MISS ROSALIE'S SCHOOL FOR THREE YEARS AND SHE WONDERED A LITTLE AT SYLVIA'S ADMIRATION FOR THEIR TEACHER
6627-67844-0011 GRACE WAS EAGER TO GET TO HER DESK FROM WHERE SHE SAT SHE COULD SEE THE GRIM LINES OF THE DISTANT FORTS AND THIS MORNING THEY HAD A NEW VALUE AND INTEREST FOR HER FOR AT BREAKFAST SHE HAD HEARD HER FATHER SAY
6627-67844-0012 IT WAS ONLY JUSTICE THAT SOUTH CAROLINA SHOULD CONTROL THEM AND IF THE STATE SECEDED FROM THE UNION CHARLESTON MUST TAKE POSSESSION OF THE FORTS WITH THE CONSENT OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IF POSSIBLE BUT IF THIS WAS REFUSED BY FORCE GRACE HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS ALL THE MORNING
6627-67844-0013 SHE RESOLVED TO ASK MISS ROSALIE WHY THE UNITED STATES SHOULD INTERFERE WITH THE SOVEREIGN STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA WHICH HER FATHER HAD SAID WOULD DEFEND ITS RIGHTS QUESTION TIME WAS JUST BEFORE THE MORNING SESSION ENDED THEN EACH PUPIL COULD ASK A QUESTION
6627-67844-0014 BUT AS A RULE ONLY ONE OR TWO OF THE GIRLS HAD ANY INQUIRY TO MAKE TO DAY HOWEVER THERE WERE SEVERAL WHO HAD QUESTIONS TO ASK AND GRACE WAITED WITH WHAT PATIENCE SHE COULD UNTIL IT WAS HER TURN WHEN MISS ROSALIE SMILED AT HER AND CALLED HER NAME GRACE ROSE AND SAID PLEASE MISS ROSALIE
6627-67844-0015 THE TEACHER'S DARK EYES SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND BRIGHTER AND SHE STRAIGHTENED HER SLENDER SHOULDERS AS IF PREPARING TO DEFEND THE RIGHTS OF HER STATE MY DEAR GIRL WHO WOULD QUESTION THE RIGHT OF SOUTH CAROLINA TO CONTROL ALL FORTS ON HER TERRITORY
6627-67844-0016 WE ALL REALIZE THAT THIS IS A TIME OF UNCERTAINTY FOR OUR BELOVED STATE WE MAY BE TREATED WITH HARSHNESS WITH INJUSTICE BUT EVERY LOYAL CAROLINIAN WILL PROTECT HIS STATE THE LITTLE GIRLS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH STARTLED EYES WHAT WAS MISS ROSALIE TALKING ABOUT THEY WONDERED
6627-67844-0017 AND WHAT DID GRACE WAITE MEAN ABOUT ANYBODY TAKING FORT SUMTER OR FORT MOULTRIE
6627-67844-0018 SCHOOL WAS DISMISSED WITH LESS CEREMONY THAN USUAL THAT MORNING AND THE LITTLE GIRLS STARTED OFF IN GROUPS TALKING AND QUESTIONING EACH OTHER ABOUT WHAT MISS ROSALIE HAD SAID TWO OR THREE RAN AFTER GRACE AND SYLVIA TO ASK GRACE WHAT SHE MEANT BY HER QUESTION
6627-67844-0019 OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT NORTHERN PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE OUR SLAVES AWAY FROM US
6627-67844-0020 WERE GREATLY ADMIRED BY AUBURN HAIRED BLUE EYED SYLVIA BUT OF COURSE THEY CAN'T DO THAT BUT HOW COULD THEY TAKE OUR FORTS I DON'T KNOW RESPONDED GRACE THAT'S WHY I ASKED MISS ROSALIE I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO ASK MY FATHER
6627-67844-0021 WE'LL ALL ASK OUR FATHERS SAID ELINOR AND TO MORROW WE WILL TELL EACH OTHER WHAT THEY SAY I DON'T SUPPOSE YOUR FATHER WOULD CARE IF THE FORTS WERE TAKEN AND SHE TURNED SUDDENLY TOWARD SYLVIA
6627-67844-0022 I SUPPOSE ALL THE YANKEES WOULD LIKE TO TELL US WHAT WE OUGHT TO DO SYLVIA LOOKED AT HER IN SURPRISE THE TALL GIRL HAD NEVER TAKEN ANY NOTICE OF THE LITTLE BOSTON GIRL BEFORE AND SYLVIA COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY ELINOR SHOULD LOOK AT HER SO SCORNFULLY OR SPEAK SO UNKINDLY
6627-67844-0023 THE OTHER GIRLS HAD STOPPED TALKING AND NOW LOOKED AT SYLVIA AS IF WONDERING WHAT SHE WOULD SAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN SHE ANSWERED BRAVELY BUT I KNOW ONE THING MY FATHER WOULD WANT WHAT WAS RIGHT THAT'S REAL YANKEE TALK SAID ELINOR
6627-67844-0024 THEY SAY SLAVERY ISN'T RIGHT THERE WAS A LITTLE MURMUR OF LAUGHTER AMONG THE OTHER GIRLS FOR IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA BELIEVED THEY WERE QUITE RIGHT IN BUYING NEGROES FOR SLAVES AND IN SELLING THEM WHEN THEY DESIRED
6627-67844-0025 SO THESE LITTLE GIRLS SOME OF WHOM ALREADY OWNED A COLORED GIRL WHO WAITED UPON THEM HAD NO IDEA BUT WHAT SLAVERY WAS A RIGHT AND NATURAL CONDITION AND WERE AMUSED AT ELINOR'S WORDS
6627-67844-0026 DEMANDED GRACE BEFORE SYLVIA COULD REPLY SYLVIA HAS NOT SAID OR DONE ANYTHING TO MAKE YOU TALK TO HER THIS WAY AND GRACE LINKED HER ARM IN SYLVIA'S AND STOOD FACING THE OTHER GIRLS WELL GRACE WAITE YOU CAN ASSOCIATE WITH YANKEES IF YOU WISH TO
6627-67844-0027 COME ON GIRLS GRACE WAITE CAN DO AS SHE PLEASES AND ELINOR FOLLOWED BY TWO OR THREE OF THE OLDER GIRLS WENT SCORNFULLY DOWN THE STREET SYLVIA WAIT AND A LITTLE GIRL ABOUT SYLVIA'S AGE CAME RUNNING DOWN THE PATH IT WAS FLORA HAYES
6627-67844-0028 AND NEXT TO GRACE WAITE SYLVIA LIKED HER THE BEST OF ANY OF HER NEW COMPANIONS DON'T MIND WHAT ELINOR MAYHEW SAYS SHE'S ALWAYS HORRID WHEN SHE DARES TO BE SAID FLORA FLORA'S FATHER WAS A WEALTHY COTTON PLANTER
6627-67844-0029 AND THEIR CHARLESTON HOME WAS IN ONE OF THE HISTORIC MANSIONS OF THAT CITY BESIDE THAT THERE WAS THE BIG OLD HOUSE ON THE ASHLEY RIVER TEN MILES FROM THE CITY WHERE THE FAMILY STAYED A PART OF THE TIME
6627-67844-0030 SHE WAS ALWAYS SMILING AND FRIENDLY AND WAS BETTER LIKED THAN ELINOR MAYHEW WHO AS FLORA SAID WAS ALWAYS READY TO TEASE THE YOUNGER GIRLS I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE MEANT SAID SYLVIA AS WITH GRACE ON ONE SIDE AND FLORA ON THE OTHER THEY STARTED TOWARD HOME SHE IS JUST HATEFUL DECLARED GRACE
6627-67844-0031 BUT I DID WANT TO KNOW IT WOULD BE DREADFUL NOT TO SEE THEM WHERE THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
6627-67844-0032 I KNOW BETTER THAN THAT TAKING THE FORTS MEANS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD OWN THEM INSTEAD OF SOUTH CAROLINA GRACE LAUGHED GOOD NATUREDLY
6627-67844-0033 BOTH GRACE AND FLORA ADVISED SYLVIA NOT TO TELL HER MOTHER OF ELINOR'S UNKINDNESS OR OF HER TAUNTING WORDS
6627-67844-0034 YOU SEE IT WILL MAKE YOUR MOTHER SORRY AND SHE WILL FRET ABOUT IT FLORA HAD SAID
6627-67844-0035 SHE WOULD NOT TELL HER MOTHER ABOUT IT SHE ALMOST DREADED SEEING ELINOR AGAIN AND WONDERED WHY ELINOR'S MOTHER HAD NOT WANTED MISS PATTEN TO TAKE HER AS A PUPIL MISTER AND MISSUS FULTON WERE SURPRISED WHEN AT SUPPER TIME SYLVIA DEMANDED TO KNOW WHAT A YANKEE WAS
6627-67844-0036 SHE THOUGHT HER MOTHER LOOKED A LITTLE TROUBLED BUT HER FATHER SMILED YANKEE IS WHAT BRITISHERS CALL ALL AMERICANS HE ANSWERED THEN ELINOR MAYHEW IS JUST AS MUCH A YANKEE AS I AM
6627-67844-0037 THOUGHT SYLVIA AND SHE SMILED SO RADIANTLY AT THE THOUGHT THAT MISSUS FULTON WAS REASSURED AND DID NOT QUESTION HER THE NEXT DAY WAS SATURDAY AND MISTER FULTON HAD PLANNED TO TAKE HIS WIFE AND SYLVIA TO FORT MOULTRIE
6627-67844-0038 DURING THE SUMMER WORKMEN HAD BEEN MAKING NECESSARY REPAIRS ON THE FORTIFICATIONS BUT VISITORS WERE ALWAYS WELCOMED BY THE OFFICERS IN CHARGE ONE OF WHOM CAPTAIN CARLETON WAS A COLLEGE FRIEND OF SYLVIA'S FATHER
6627-67844-0039 SYLVIA COULD ROW A SMALL BOAT VERY WELL AND HER FATHER HAD PURCHASED A PRETTY SAILBOAT WHICH HE WAS TEACHING HER TO STEER SHE OFTEN WENT WITH HER FATHER ON TRIPS ABOUT THE HARBOR AND THE LITTLE GIRL ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THESE EXCURSIONS WERE THE MOST DELIGHTFUL OF PLEASURES
6627-67844-0040 THERE WAS A FAVORABLE BREEZE THIS SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND THE LITTLE BOAT WITH ITS SHINING WHITE PAINT AND SNOWY SAIL SKIMMED SWIFTLY ACROSS THE HARBOR SYLVIA WATCHED THE LITTLE WAVES WHICH SEEMED TO DANCE FORWARD TO MEET THEM
6627-67844-0041 LOOKED AT THE MANY BOATS AND VESSELS AND QUITE FORGOT ELINOR MAYHEW'S UNKINDNESS HER MOTHER AND FATHER WERE TALKING OF THE BLACK SERVANTS WHOM THEY HAD HIRED WITH THE HOUSE OF MISTER ROBERT WAITE GRACE'S UNCLE
6627-67844-0042 SYLVIA HEARD THEM SPEAK OF AUNT CONNIE THE GOOD NATURED BLACK COOK WHO LIVED IN A CABIN BEHIND THE FULTONS KITCHEN AUNT CONNIE WANTS TO BRING HER LITTLE GIRL TO LIVE WITH HER THEIR MASTER IS WILLING IF WE HAVE NO OBJECTIONS SYLVIA HEARD HER MOTHER SAY OH LET THE CHILD COME MISTER FULTON RESPONDED
