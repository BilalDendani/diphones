7982-245691-0000 QUESTION SEVENTY NINE OF THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS
7982-245691-0001 IF IT BE A POWER WHETHER IT IS A PASSIVE POWER THREE IF IT IS A PASSIVE POWER WHETHER THERE IS AN ACTIVE INTELLECT FOUR WHETHER IT IS SOMETHING IN THE SOUL
7982-245691-0002 FIVE WHETHER THE ACTIVE INTELLECT IS ONE IN ALL SIX WHETHER MEMORY IS IN THE INTELLECT SEVEN
7982-245691-0003 WHETHER THE MEMORY BE DISTINCT FROM THE INTELLECT EIGHT WHETHER THE REASON IS A DISTINCT POWER FROM THE INTELLECT NINE WHETHER THE SUPERIOR AND INFERIOR REASON ARE DISTINCT POWERS
7982-245691-0004 TEN WHETHER THE INTELLIGENCE IS DISTINCT FROM THE INTELLECT ELEVEN WHETHER THE SPECULATIVE AND PRACTICAL INTELLECT ARE DISTINCT POWERS TWELVE
7982-245691-0005 WHETHER THE INTELLECT IS A POWER OF THE SOUL OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE INTELLECT IS NOT A POWER OF THE SOUL BUT THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL
7982-245691-0006 FOR THE INTELLECT SEEMS TO BE THE SAME AS THE MIND NOW THE MIND IS NOT A POWER OF THE SOUL BUT THE ESSENCE FOR AUGUSTINE SAYS
7982-245691-0007 MIND AND SPIRIT ARE NOT RELATIVE THINGS BUT DENOMINATE THE ESSENCE THEREFORE THE INTELLECT IS THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL
7982-245691-0008 FURTHER DIFFERENT GENERA OF THE SOUL'S POWERS ARE NOT UNITED IN SOME ONE POWER BUT ONLY IN THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL
7982-245691-0009 BUT THEY ARE UNITED IN THE MIND FOR AUGUSTINE
7982-245691-0010 PLACES THE INTELLIGENCE AND WILL IN THE MIND THEREFORE THE MIND AND INTELLECT OF MAN IS OF THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE SOUL AND NOT A POWER THEREOF
7982-245691-0011 FURTHER A SUBSTANCE IS INTELLECTUAL BY THE FACT THAT IT IS IMMATERIAL BUT THE SOUL IS IMMATERIAL THROUGH ITS ESSENCE THEREFORE IT SEEMS THAT THE SOUL MUST BE INTELLECTUAL THROUGH ITS ESSENCE
7982-245691-0012 ON THE CONTRARY THE PHILOSOPHER ASSIGNS THE INTELLECTUAL FACULTY AS A POWER OF THE SOUL
7982-245691-0013 I ANSWER THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT HAS BEEN ALREADY SHOWN
7982-245691-0014 IT IS NECESSARY TO SAY THAT THE INTELLECT IS A POWER OF THE SOUL AND NOT THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE SOUL FOR THEN ALONE THE ESSENCE OF THAT WHICH OPERATES IS THE IMMEDIATE PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION
7982-245691-0015 WHEN OPERATION ITSELF IS ITS BEING FOR AS POWER IS TO OPERATION AS ITS ACT SO IS THE ESSENCE TO BEING BUT IN GOD ALONE HIS ACTION OF UNDERSTANDING IS HIS VERY BEING
7982-245691-0016 WHEREFORE IN GOD ALONE IS HIS INTELLECT HIS ESSENCE WHILE IN OTHER INTELLECTUAL CREATURES THE INTELLECT IS A POWER
7982-245691-0017 SENSE IS SOMETIMES TAKEN FOR THE POWER AND SOMETIMES FOR THE SENSITIVE SOUL FOR THE SENSITIVE SOUL TAKES ITS NAME FROM ITS CHIEF POWER WHICH IS SENSE
7982-245691-0018 AND IN LIKE MANNER THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IS SOMETIMES CALLED INTELLECT AS FROM ITS CHIEF POWER AND THUS WE READ
7982-245691-0019 THAT THE INTELLECT IS A SUBSTANCE AND IN THIS SENSE ALSO AUGUSTINE SAYS THAT THE MIND IS SPIRIT AND ESSENCE
7982-245691-0020 THE APPETITIVE AND INTELLECTUAL POWERS ARE DIFFERENT GENERA OF POWERS IN THE SOUL BY REASON OF THE DIFFERENT FORMALITIES OF THEIR OBJECTS BUT THE APPETITIVE POWER AGREES PARTLY WITH THE INTELLECTUAL POWER
7982-245691-0021 AND PARTLY WITH THE SENSITIVE IN ITS MODE OF OPERATION
7982-245691-0022 BECAUSE HIS WHOLE POWER CONSISTS IN THIS BUT THE SOUL HAS MANY OTHER POWERS SUCH AS THE SENSITIVE AND NUTRITIVE POWERS AND THEREFORE THE COMPARISON FAILS
7982-245691-0023 BUT THAT IT IS ITS VIRTUE AND POWER
7982-245691-0024 BUT THE INTELLECTUAL POWER RESULTS FROM THE IMMATERIALITY OF THE INTELLIGENT SUBSTANCE THEREFORE IT SEEMS THAT THE INTELLECT IS NOT A PASSIVE POWER
7982-245691-0025 BUT IF THE INTELLECT IS PASSIVE IT IS CORRUPTIBLE
7982-245691-0026 MUCH MORE THEREFORE ALL THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS WHICH ARE THE HIGHEST ARE ACTIVE ON THE CONTRARY THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
7982-245691-0027 THAT TO UNDERSTAND IS IN A WAY TO BE PASSIVE I ANSWER THAT TO BE PASSIVE MAY BE TAKEN IN THREE WAYS FIRSTLY IN ITS MOST STRICT SENSE
7982-245691-0028 WHEN FROM A THING IS TAKEN SOMETHING WHICH BELONGS TO IT BY VIRTUE EITHER OF ITS NATURE OR OF ITS PROPER INCLINATION AS WHEN WATER LOSES COOLNESS BY HEATING AND AS WHEN A MAN BECOMES ILL OR SAD
7982-245691-0029 THAT IS SAD BUT ALSO HE THAT IS JOYFUL OR WHATEVER WAY HE BE ALTERED OR MOVED THIRDLY IN A WIDE SENSE A THING IS SAID TO BE PASSIVE
7982-245691-0030 FOR WE FIND AN INTELLECT WHOSE RELATION TO UNIVERSAL BEING IS THAT OF THE ACT OF ALL BEING AND SUCH IS THE DIVINE INTELLECT WHICH IS THE ESSENCE OF GOD IN WHICH ORIGINALLY AND VIRTUALLY
7982-245691-0031 ALL BEING PRE EXISTS AS IN ITS FIRST CAUSE AND THEREFORE THE DIVINE INTELLECT IS NOT IN POTENTIALITY BUT IS PURE ACT
7982-245691-0032 WHEREFORE EVERY CREATED INTELLECT IS NOT THE ACT OF ALL THINGS INTELLIGIBLE BY REASON OF ITS VERY EXISTENCE BUT IS COMPARED TO THESE INTELLIGIBLE THINGS AS A POTENTIALITY TO ACT
7982-245691-0033 WHEREFORE THE ANGELIC INTELLECT IS ALWAYS IN ACT AS REGARDS THOSE THINGS WHICH IT CAN UNDERSTAND BY REASON OF ITS PROXIMITY TO THE FIRST INTELLECT WHICH IS PURE ACT AS WE HAVE SAID ABOVE
7982-245691-0034 BUT THE HUMAN INTELLECT WHICH IS THE LOWEST IN THE ORDER OF INTELLIGENCE AND MOST REMOTE FROM THE PERFECTION OF THE DIVINE INTELLECT IS IN POTENTIALITY WITH REGARD TO THINGS INTELLIGIBLE
7982-245691-0035 AND IS AT FIRST LIKE A CLEAN TABLET ON WHICH NOTHING IS WRITTEN AS THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
7982-245691-0036 IS IN A WAY TO BE PASSIVE TAKING PASSION IN THE THIRD SENSE AND CONSEQUENTLY THE INTELLECT IS A PASSIVE POWER
7982-245691-0037 WHICH BELONG TO PRIMARY MATTER BUT IN THE THIRD SENSE PASSION IS IN ANYTHING WHICH IS REDUCED FROM POTENTIALITY TO ACT
7982-245691-0038 BUT THE INTELLECT WHICH IS IN POTENTIALITY TO THINGS INTELLIGIBLE AND WHICH FOR THIS REASON ARISTOTLE CALLS THE POSSIBLE INTELLECT
7982-245691-0039 IS NOT PASSIVE EXCEPT IN THE THIRD SENSE
7982-245691-0040 HENCE IT IS INCORRUPTIBLE
7982-245691-0041 THE AGENT IS NOBLER THAN THE PATIENT IF THE ACTION AND THE PASSION ARE REFERRED TO THE SAME THING BUT NOT ALWAYS IF THEY REFER TO DIFFERENT THINGS
7982-245691-0042 NOW THE INTELLECT IS A PASSIVE POWER IN REGARD TO THE WHOLE UNIVERSAL BEING WHILE THE VEGETATIVE POWER IS ACTIVE IN REGARD TO SOME PARTICULAR THING NAMELY THE BODY AS UNITED TO THE SOUL
7982-245691-0043 SO IS OUR INTELLECT TO THINGS INTELLIGIBLE BUT BECAUSE SENSE IS IN POTENTIALITY TO THINGS SENSIBLE THE SENSE IS NOT SAID TO BE ACTIVE BUT ONLY PASSIVE THEREFORE
7982-245691-0044 SINCE OUR INTELLECT IS IN POTENTIALITY TO THINGS INTELLIGIBLE IT SEEMS THAT WE CANNOT SAY THAT THE INTELLECT IS ACTIVE BUT ONLY THAT IT IS PASSIVE
7982-245691-0045 FURTHER IF WE SAY THAT ALSO IN THE SENSES THERE IS SOMETHING ACTIVE SUCH AS LIGHT ON THE CONTRARY LIGHT IS REQUIRED FOR SIGHT INASMUCH AS IT MAKES THE MEDIUM TO BE ACTUALLY LUMINOUS
7982-245691-0046 FOR COLOR OF ITS OWN NATURE MOVES THE LUMINOUS MEDIUM BUT IN THE OPERATION OF THE INTELLECT THERE IS NO APPOINTED MEDIUM THAT HAS TO BE BROUGHT INTO ACT THEREFORE THERE IS NO NECESSITY FOR AN ACTIVE INTELLECT
7982-245691-0047 FURTHER THE LIKENESS OF THE AGENT IS RECEIVED INTO THE PATIENT ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THE PATIENT BUT THE PASSIVE INTELLECT IS AN IMMATERIAL POWER THEREFORE
7982-245691-0048 ITS IMMATERIAL NATURE SUFFICES FOR FORMS TO BE RECEIVED INTO IT IMMATERIALLY NOW A FORM IS INTELLIGIBLE IN ACT FROM THE VERY FACT THAT IT IS IMMATERIAL THEREFORE THERE IS NO NEED FOR AN ACTIVE INTELLECT
7982-245691-0049 TO MAKE THE SPECIES ACTUALLY INTELLIGIBLE ON THE CONTRARY THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
7982-245691-0050 AS IN EVERY NATURE SO IN THE SOUL IS THERE SOMETHING BY WHICH IT BECOMES ALL THINGS AND SOMETHING BY WHICH IT MAKES ALL THINGS THEREFORE WE MUST ADMIT AN ACTIVE INTELLECT
7982-245691-0051 I ANSWER THAT ACCORDING TO THE OPINION OF PLATO THERE IS NO NEED FOR AN ACTIVE INTELLECT IN ORDER TO MAKE THINGS ACTUALLY INTELLIGIBLE BUT PERHAPS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE INTELLECTUAL LIGHT TO THE INTELLECT
7982-245691-0052 FOR PLATO SUPPOSED THAT THE FORMS OF NATURAL THINGS SUBSISTED APART FROM MATTER AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT THEY ARE INTELLIGIBLE SINCE A THING IS ACTUALLY INTELLIGIBLE FROM THE VERY FACT THAT IT IS IMMATERIAL
7982-245691-0053 IN ORDER THAT INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE NATURALLY ESTABLISHED IN THEIR PROPER GENERA AND SPECIES AND THAT OUR INTELLECT WAS FORMED BY SUCH PARTICIPATION IN ORDER TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GENERA AND SPECIES OF THINGS
7982-245691-0054 BUT SINCE ARISTOTLE DID NOT ALLOW THAT FORMS OF NATURAL THINGS EXIST APART FROM MATTER AND AS FORMS EXISTING IN MATTER ARE NOT ACTUALLY INTELLIGIBLE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE NATURES OR FORMS OF THE SENSIBLE THINGS WHICH WE UNDERSTAND ARE NOT ACTUALLY INTELLIGIBLE
7982-245691-0055 WE MUST THEREFORE ASSIGN ON THE PART OF THE INTELLECT SOME POWER TO MAKE THINGS ACTUALLY INTELLIGIBLE BY ABSTRACTION OF THE SPECIES FROM MATERIAL CONDITIONS AND SUCH IS THE NECESSITY FOR AN ACTIVE INTELLECT
7982-245691-0056 SENSIBLE THINGS ARE FOUND IN ACT OUTSIDE THE SOUL AND HENCE THERE IS NO NEED FOR AN ACTIVE SENSE WHEREFORE IT IS CLEAR THAT IN THE NUTRITIVE PART ALL THE POWERS ARE ACTIVE
7982-245691-0057 WHEREAS IN THE SENSITIVE PART ALL ARE PASSIVE BUT IN THE INTELLECTUAL PART THERE IS SOMETHING ACTIVE AND SOMETHING PASSIVE
7982-245691-0058 LIGHT IS REQUIRED FOR SIGHT NOT FOR THE COLORS TO BECOME ACTUALLY VISIBLE BUT IN ORDER THAT THE MEDIUM MAY BECOME ACTUALLY LUMINOUS AS THE COMMENTATOR SAYS ON
7982-245691-0059 IF THE AGENT PRE EXIST IT MAY WELL HAPPEN THAT ITS LIKENESS IS RECEIVED VARIOUSLY INTO VARIOUS THINGS ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR DISPOSITIONS BUT IF THE AGENT DOES NOT PRE EXIST
7982-245691-0060 THE DISPOSITION OF THE RECIPIENT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MATTER NOW THE INTELLIGIBLE IN ACT IS NOT SOMETHING EXISTING IN NATURE IF WE CONSIDER THE NATURE OF THINGS SENSIBLE WHICH DO NOT SUBSIST APART FROM MATTER
7982-245691-0061 AND THEREFORE IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THEM THE IMMATERIAL NATURE OF THE PASSIVE INTELLECT WOULD NOT SUFFICE BUT FOR THE PRESENCE OF THE ACTIVE INTELLECT WHICH MAKES THINGS ACTUALLY INTELLIGIBLE BY WAY OF ABSTRACTION
7982-245691-0062 FOR THE EFFECT OF THE ACTIVE INTELLECT IS TO GIVE LIGHT FOR THE PURPOSE OF UNDERSTANDING BUT THIS IS DONE BY SOMETHING HIGHER THAN THE SOUL ACCORDING TO JOHN ONE NINE
7982-245691-0063 HE WAS THE TRUE LIGHT THAT ENLIGHTENETH EVERY MAN COMING INTO THIS WORLD THEREFORE THE ACTIVE INTELLECT IS NOT SOMETHING IN THE SOUL
7982-245691-0064 SAYS OF THE ACTIVE INTELLECT THAT IT DOES NOT SOMETIMES UNDERSTAND AND SOMETIMES NOT UNDERSTAND BUT OUR SOUL DOES NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES IT UNDERSTANDS SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND
7982-245691-0065 THEREFORE THE ACTIVE INTELLECT IS NOT SOMETHING IN OUR SOUL
7982-245691-0066 FURTHER AGENT AND PATIENT SUFFICE FOR ACTION IF THEREFORE THE PASSIVE INTELLECT WHICH IS A PASSIVE POWER IS SOMETHING BELONGING TO THE SOUL AND ALSO THE ACTIVE INTELLECT
7982-245691-0067 WHICH IS AN ACTIVE POWER IT FOLLOWS THAT A MAN WOULD ALWAYS BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHEN HE WISHED WHICH IS CLEARLY FALSE THEREFORE THE ACTIVE INTELLECT IS NOT SOMETHING IN OUR SOUL
7982-245691-0068 SAYS THAT THE ACTIVE INTELLECT IS A SUBSTANCE IN ACTUAL BEING BUT NOTHING CAN BE IN POTENTIALITY AND IN ACT WITH REGARD TO THE SAME THING
7982-245691-0069 IF THEREFORE THE PASSIVE INTELLECT WHICH IS IN POTENTIALITY TO ALL THINGS INTELLIGIBLE IS SOMETHING IN THE SOUL IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE ACTIVE INTELLECT TO BE ALSO SOMETHING IN OUR SOUL
7982-245691-0070 FURTHER IF THE ACTIVE INTELLECT IS SOMETHING IN THE SOUL IT MUST BE A POWER FOR IT IS NEITHER A PASSION NOR A HABIT
