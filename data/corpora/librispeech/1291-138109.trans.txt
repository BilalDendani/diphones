1291-138109-0000 CHAPTER FORTY TWO WHEN CHARLES LEFT DUCIE STREET HE HAD CAUGHT THE FIRST TRAIN HOME BUT HAD NO INKLING OF THE NEWEST DEVELOPMENT UNTIL LATE AT NIGHT THEN HIS FATHER WHO HAD DINED ALONE SENT FOR HIM AND IN VERY GRAVE TONES

1291-138109-0002 ANOTHER HOUR PASSED THE SERVANTS WENT TO BED AND CHARLES VISITED HIS FATHER AGAIN TO RECEIVE FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS MISSUS WILCOX HAD STILL NOT RETURNED I'LL SIT UP FOR HER AS LATE AS YOU LIKE
1291-138109-0003 BUT SHE CAN HARDLY BE COMING ISN'T SHE STOPPING WITH HER SISTER AT THE HOTEL PERHAPS SAID MISTER WILCOX THOUGHTFULLY PERHAPS CAN I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU SIR NOT TONIGHT MY BOY
1291-138109-0004 MISTER WILCOX LIKED BEING CALLED SIR HE RAISED HIS EYES AND GAVE HIS SON MORE OPEN A LOOK OF TENDERNESS THAN HE USUALLY VENTURED HE SAW CHARLES AS LITTLE BOY AND STRONG MAN IN ONE THOUGH HIS WIFE HAD PROVED UNSTABLE
1291-138109-0005 HIS CHILDREN WERE LEFT TO HIM AFTER MIDNIGHT HE TAPPED ON CHARLES'S DOOR I CAN'T SLEEP HE SAID I HAD BETTER HAVE A TALK WITH YOU AND GET IT OVER HE COMPLAINED OF THE HEAT
1291-138109-0006 CHARLES TOOK HIM OUT INTO THE GARDEN AND THEY PACED UP AND DOWN IN THEIR DRESSING GOWNS CHARLES BECAME VERY QUIET AS THE STORY UNROLLED HE HAD KNOWN ALL ALONG THAT MARGARET WAS AS BAD AS HER SISTER
1291-138109-0007 SHE WILL FEEL DIFFERENTLY IN THE MORNING SAID MISTER WILCOX WHO HAD OF COURSE SAID NOTHING ABOUT MISSUS BAST BUT I CANNOT LET THIS KIND OF THING CONTINUE WITHOUT COMMENT I AM MORALLY CERTAIN THAT SHE IS WITH HER SISTER AT HOWARDS END

1291-138109-0009 I MEAN THAT NO ONE IS TO LIVE THERE I WON'T HAVE IT HE LOOKED ANGRILY AT THE MOON TO MY MIND THIS QUESTION IS CONNECTED WITH SOMETHING FAR GREATER THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY ITSELF
1291-138109-0010 UNDOUBTEDLY SAID CHARLES MISTER WILCOX LINKED HIS ARM IN HIS SON'S BUT SOMEHOW LIKED HIM LESS AS HE TOLD HIM MORE
1291-138109-0011 SHE WAS ONLY OVER WROUGHT AS WHO WOULD NOT BE
1291-138109-0012 THAT IS A SINE QUA NON THEN AT EIGHT TOMORROW I MAY GO UP IN THE CAR EIGHT OR EARLIER SAY THAT YOU ARE ACTING AS MY REPRESENTATIVE AND OF COURSE USE NO VIOLENCE CHARLES
1291-138109-0013 ON THE MORROW AS CHARLES RETURNED LEAVING LEONARD DEAD UPON THE GRAVEL IT DID NOT SEEM TO HIM THAT HE HAD USED VIOLENCE DEATH WAS DUE TO HEART DISEASE
1291-138109-0014 HIS STEPMOTHER HERSELF HAD SAID SO AND EVEN MISS AVERY HAD ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE ONLY USED THE FLAT OF THE SWORD ON HIS WAY THROUGH THE VILLAGE HE INFORMED THE POLICE WHO THANKED HIM AND SAID THERE MUST BE AN INQUEST HE FOUND HIS FATHER IN THE GARDEN SHADING HIS EYES FROM THE SUN
1291-138109-0015 SAID CHARLES GRAVELY THEY WERE THERE AND THEY HAD THE MAN UP THERE WITH THEM TOO
1291-138109-0016 WHAT MAN I TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT HIS NAME WAS BAST MY GOD IS IT POSSIBLE SAID MISTER WILCOX IN YOUR MOTHER'S HOUSE CHARLES IN YOUR MOTHER'S HOUSE I KNOW PATER
1291-138109-0017 THAT WAS WHAT I FELT AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE IS NO NEED TO TROUBLE ABOUT THE MAN HE WAS IN THE LAST STAGES OF HEART DISEASE AND JUST BEFORE I COULD SHOW HIM WHAT I THOUGHT OF HIM HE WENT OFF THE POLICE ARE SEEING ABOUT IT AT THIS MOMENT
1291-138109-0018 MISTER WILCOX LISTENED ATTENTIVELY I GOT UP THERE OH IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE THAN HALF PAST SEVEN THE AVERY WOMAN WAS LIGHTING A FIRE FOR THEM THEY WERE STILL UPSTAIRS I WAITED IN THE DRAWING ROOM
1291-138109-0019 WE WERE ALL MODERATELY CIVIL AND COLLECTED THOUGH I HAD MY SUSPICIONS I GAVE THEM YOUR MESSAGE AND MISSUS WILCOX SAID OH YES I SEE YES IN THAT WAY OF HERS NOTHING ELSE
1291-138109-0020 I PROMISED TO TELL YOU WITH HER LOVE THAT SHE WAS GOING TO GERMANY WITH HER SISTER THIS EVENING THAT WAS ALL WE HAD TIME FOR MISTER WILCOX SEEMED RELIEVED
1291-138109-0021 BECAUSE BY THEN I SUPPOSE THE MAN GOT TIRED OF HIDING FOR SUDDENLY MISSUS WILCOX SCREAMED OUT HIS NAME I RECOGNIZED IT AND I WENT FOR HIM IN THE HALL
1291-138109-0022 I THOUGHT THINGS WERE GOING A LITTLE TOO FAR RIGHT MY DEAR BOY I DON'T KNOW BUT YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN NO SON OF MINE IF YOU HADN'T THEN DID HE JUST JUST CRUMPLE UP AS YOU SAID
1291-138109-0023 HE SHRUNK FROM THE SIMPLE WORD HE CAUGHT HOLD OF THE BOOKCASE WHICH CAME DOWN OVER HIM SO I MERELY PUT THE SWORD DOWN AND CARRIED HIM INTO THE GARDEN WE ALL THOUGHT HE WAS SHAMMING HOWEVER HE'S DEAD RIGHT ENOUGH
1291-138109-0024 AWFUL BUSINESS SWORD CRIED HIS FATHER WITH ANXIETY IN HIS VOICE WHAT SWORD WHOSE SWORD A SWORD OF THEIRS WHAT WERE YOU DOING WITH IT
1291-138109-0025 I HAD TO SNATCH UP THE FIRST THING HANDY I HADN'T A RIDING WHIP OR STICK I CAUGHT HIM ONCE OR TWICE OVER THE SHOULDERS WITH THE FLAT OF THEIR OLD GERMAN SWORD THEN WHAT HE PULLED OVER THE BOOKCASE AS I SAID AND FELL
1291-138109-0026 SAID CHARLES WITH A SIGH IT WAS NO FUN DOING ERRANDS FOR HIS FATHER WHO WAS NEVER QUITE SATISFIED BUT THE REAL CAUSE WAS HEART DISEASE OF THAT YOU'RE SURE THAT OR A FIT
1291-138109-0027 THEY WENT INTO BREAKFAST
1291-138109-0028 HE WAS ALSO ANXIOUS ABOUT THE FUTURE REFLECTING THAT THE POLICE MUST DETAIN HELEN AND MARGARET FOR THE INQUEST AND FERRET THE WHOLE THING OUT HE SAW HIMSELF OBLIGED TO LEAVE HILTON ONE COULD NOT AFFORD TO LIVE NEAR THE SCENE OF A SCANDAL
1291-138109-0029 IT WAS NOT FAIR ON ONE'S WIFE HIS COMFORT WAS THAT THE PATER'S EYES WERE OPENED AT LAST THERE WOULD BE A HORRIBLE SMASH UP AND PROBABLY A SEPARATION FROM MARGARET
1291-138109-0030 I THINK I'LL GO ROUND TO THE POLICE STATION SAID HIS FATHER WHEN BREAKFAST WAS OVER WHAT FOR CRIED DOLLY WHO HAD STILL NOT BEEN TOLD VERY WELL SIR WHICH CAR WILL YOU HAVE I THINK I'LL WALK
1291-138109-0031 IT'S A GOOD HALF MILE SAID CHARLES STEPPING INTO THE GARDEN THE SUN'S VERY HOT FOR APRIL
1291-138109-0032 CHARLES HARDENED HIS MOUTH YOU YOUNG FELLOWS ONE IDEA IS TO GET INTO A MOTOR I TELL YOU I WANT TO WALK I'M VERY FOND OF WALKING OH ALL RIGHT I'M ABOUT THE HOUSE IF YOU WANT ME FOR ANYTHING
1291-138109-0033 I THOUGHT OF NOT GOING UP TO THE OFFICE TODAY IF THAT IS YOUR WISH IT IS INDEED MY BOY SAID MISTER WILCOX AND LAID A HAND ON HIS SLEEVE CHARLES DID NOT LIKE IT HE WAS UNEASY ABOUT HIS FATHER WHO DID NOT SEEM HIMSELF THIS MORNING
1291-138109-0034 THERE WAS A PETULANT TOUCH ABOUT HIM MORE LIKE A WOMAN COULD IT BE THAT HE WAS GROWING OLD THE WILCOXES WERE NOT LACKING IN AFFECTION THEY HAD IT ROYALLY BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO USE IT IT WAS THE TALENT IN THE NAPKIN AND
1291-138109-0035 FOR A WARM HEARTED MAN CHARLES HAD CONVEYED VERY LITTLE JOY AS HE WATCHED HIS FATHER SHUFFLING UP THE ROAD
1291-138109-0036 A WISH THOUGH HE DID NOT EXPRESS IT THUS THAT HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO SAY I IN HIS YOUTH HE MEANT TO MAKE UP FOR MARGARET'S DEFECTION BUT KNEW THAT HIS FATHER HAD BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH HER UNTIL YESTERDAY
1291-138109-0037 HOW HAD SHE DONE IT BY SOME DISHONEST TRICK NO DOUBT BUT HOW MISTER WILCOX REAPPEARED AT ELEVEN LOOKING VERY TIRED
1291-138109-0038 THERE WAS TO BE AN INQUEST ON LEONARD'S BODY TOMORROW AND THE POLICE REQUIRED HIS SON TO ATTEND I EXPECTED THAT SAID CHARLES
