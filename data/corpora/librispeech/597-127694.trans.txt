597-127694-0000 THE FOREST TREES IN GENERAL FOR THE USE OF THE EVER INCREASING NUMBER OF YOSEMITE VISITORS WHO MAKE EXTENSIVE EXCURSIONS INTO THE MOUNTAINS BEYOND THE VALLEY A SKETCH OF THE FOREST TREES IN GENERAL WILL PROBABLY BE FOUND USEFUL
597-127694-0001 THE DIFFERENT SPECIES ARE ARRANGED IN ZONES AND SECTIONS WHICH BRINGS THE FOREST AS A WHOLE WITHIN THE COMPREHENSION OF EVERY OBSERVER THESE SPECIES ARE ALWAYS FOUND AS CONTROLLED BY THE CLIMATES OF DIFFERENT ELEVATIONS
597-127694-0002 BY SOIL AND BY THE COMPARATIVE STRENGTH OF EACH SPECIES IN TAKING AND HOLDING POSSESSION OF THE GROUND AND SO APPRECIABLE ARE THESE RELATIONS THE TRAVELER NEED NEVER BE AT A LOSS IN DETERMINING WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED FEET HIS ELEVATION ABOVE SEA LEVEL BY THE TREES ALONE
597-127694-0003 FOR NOTWITHSTANDING SOME OF THE SPECIES RANGE UPWARD FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET AND ALL PASS ONE ANOTHER MORE OR LESS YET EVEN THOSE SPECIES POSSESSING THE GREATEST VERTICAL RANGE ARE AVAILABLE IN MEASURING THE ELEVATION
597-127694-0004 THE TREES GROW SO FAR APART THAT NOT ONE TWENTIETH OF THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND IS IN SHADE AT NOON AFTER ADVANCING FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MILES TOWARDS YOSEMITE AND MAKING AN ASCENT OF FROM TWO TO THREE THOUSAND FEET
597-127694-0005 WHICH SWEEP UP TO THE FEET OF THE SUMMIT PEAKS IN A DWARFED FRINGE TO A HEIGHT OF FROM TEN TO TWELVE THOUSAND FEET THAT THIS GENERAL ORDER OF DISTRIBUTION DEPENDS ON CLIMATE AS AFFECTED BY HEIGHT ABOVE THE SEA IS SEEN AT ONCE
597-127694-0006 BUT THERE ARE OTHER HARMONIES THAT BECOME MANIFEST ONLY AFTER OBSERVATION AND STUDY ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING OF THESE IS THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE FOREST IN LONG CURVING BANDS BRAIDED TOGETHER INTO LACE LIKE PATTERNS IN SOME PLACES
597-127694-0007 AND OUT SPREAD IN CHARMING VARIETY THE KEY TO THESE STRIKING ARRANGEMENTS IS THE SYSTEM OF ANCIENT GLACIERS WHERE THEY FLOWED THE TREES FOLLOWED TRACING THEIR COURSES ALONG THE SIDES OF CANYONS OVER RIDGES AND HIGH PLATEAUS
597-127694-0008 THE CEDAR OF LEBANON SAID SIR JOSEPH HOOKER OCCURS UPON ONE OF THE MORAINES OF AN ANCIENT GLACIER ALL THE FORESTS OF THE SIERRA ARE GROWING UPON MORAINES
597-127694-0009 BUT MORAINES VANISH LIKE THE GLACIERS THAT MAKE THEM EVERY STORM THAT FALLS UPON THEM WASTES THEM CARRYING AWAY THEIR DECAYING DISINTEGRATING MATERIAL INTO NEW FORMATIONS UNTIL THEY ARE NO LONGER RECOGNIZABLE
597-127694-0010 WITHOUT TRACING THEIR TRANSITIONAL FORMS DOWN THE RANGE FROM THOSE STILL IN PROCESS OF FORMATION IN SOME PLACES THROUGH THOSE THAT ARE MORE AND MORE ANCIENT AND MORE OBSCURED BY VEGETATION AND ALL KINDS OF POST GLACIAL WEATHERING IT APPEARS THEREFORE
597-127694-0011 THAT THE SIERRA FORESTS INDICATE THE EXTENT AND POSITIONS OF ANCIENT MORAINES AS WELL AS THEY DO BELTS OF CLIMATE ONE WILL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN KNOWING THE NUT PINE PINUS SABINIANA
597-127694-0012 ITS LOWER ABOUT FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED FEET IT IS REMARKABLE FOR ITS LOOSE AIRY WIDE BRANCHING HABIT AND THIN GRAY FOLIAGE FULL GROWN SPECIMENS ARE FROM FORTY TO FIFTY FEET IN HEIGHT
597-127694-0013 THEIR SLENDER GRAYISH NEEDLES ARE FROM EIGHT TO TWELVE INCHES LONG AND INCLINED TO DROOP CONTRASTING WITH THE RIGID DARK COLORED TRUNK AND BRANCHES NO OTHER TREE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE SO SUBSTANTIAL IN ITS BODY
597-127694-0014 NEVERTHELESS THE LITTLE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL CAN OPEN THEM INDIANS CLIMB THE TREES LIKE BEARS AND BEAT OFF THE CONES OR RECKLESSLY CUT OFF THE MORE FRUITFUL BRANCHES WITH HATCHETS WHILE THE SQUAWS GATHER AND ROAST THEM UNTIL THE SCALES OPEN SUFFICIENTLY
597-127694-0015 TO ALLOW THE HARD SHELL SEEDS TO BE BEATEN OUT THE CURIOUS LITTLE PINUS ATTENUATA IS FOUND AT AN ELEVATION OF FROM FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO THREE THOUSAND FEET GROWING IN CLOSE GROVES AND BELTS
597-127694-0016 IT IS EXCEEDINGLY SLENDER AND GRACEFUL ALTHOUGH TREES THAT CHANCE TO STAND ALONE SEND OUT VERY LONG CURVED BRANCHES MAKING A STRIKING CONTRAST TO THE ORDINARY GROVE FORM
597-127694-0017 THE FOLIAGE IS OF THE SAME PECULIAR GRAY GREEN COLOR AS THAT OF THE NUT PINE AND IS WORN ABOUT AS LOOSELY SO THAT THE BODY OF THE TREE IS SCARCELY OBSCURED BY IT
597-127694-0018 AT THE AGE OF SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS IT BEGINS TO BEAR CONES IN WHORLS ON THE MAIN AXIS AND AS THEY NEVER FALL OFF THE TRUNK IS SOON PICTURESQUELY DOTTED WITH THEM BRANCHES ALSO SOON BECOME FRUITFUL
597-127694-0019 THE AVERAGE SIZE OF THE TREE IS ABOUT THIRTY OR FORTY FEET IN HEIGHT AND TWELVE TO FOURTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER THE CONES ARE ABOUT FOUR INCHES LONG AND COVERED WITH A SORT OF VARNISH AND GUM RENDERING THEM IMPERVIOUS TO MOISTURE
597-127694-0020 AFTER A RUNNING FIRE HAS SCORCHED AND KILLED IT THE CONES OPEN AND THE GROUND BENEATH IT IS THEN SOWN BROADCAST WITH ALL THE SEEDS RIPENED DURING ITS WHOLE LIFE
597-127694-0021 OF ALL THE WORLD'S EIGHTY OR NINETY SPECIES OF PINE TREES THE SUGAR PINE PINUS LAMBERTIANA IS KING SURPASSING ALL OTHERS NOT MERELY IN SIZE BUT IN LORDLY BEAUTY AND MAJESTY
597-127694-0022 IN THE YOSEMITE REGION IT GROWS AT AN ELEVATION OF FROM THREE THOUSAND TO SEVEN THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA AND ATTAINS MOST PERFECT DEVELOPMENT AT A HEIGHT OF ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND FEET THE LARGEST SPECIMENS ARE COMMONLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FEET HIGH
597-127694-0023 AND FROM SIX TO EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER FOUR FEET FROM THE GROUND THOUGH SOME GRAND OLD PATRIARCH MAY BE MET HERE AND THERE THAT HAS ENJOYED SIX OR EIGHT CENTURIES OF STORMS AND ATTAINED A THICKNESS OF TEN OR EVEN TWELVE FEET
597-127694-0024 STILL SWEET AND FRESH IN EVERY FIBER THE TRUNK IS A REMARKABLY SMOOTH ROUND DELICATELY TAPERED SHAFT STRAIGHT AND REGULAR AS IF TURNED IN A LATHE MOSTLY WITHOUT LIMBS
597-127694-0025 PURPLISH BROWN IN COLOR AND USUALLY ENLIVENED WITH TUFTS OF A YELLOW LICHEN TOWARD THE HEAD OF THIS MAGNIFICENT COLUMN LONG BRANCHES SWEEP GRACEFULLY OUTWARD AND DOWNWARD SOMETIMES FORMING A PALM LIKE CROWN
597-127694-0026 HOW WELL THEY SING IN THE WIND AND HOW STRIKINGLY HARMONIOUS AN EFFECT IS MADE BY THE LONG CYLINDRICAL CONES DEPENDING LOOSELY FROM THE ENDS OF THE LONG BRANCHES THE CONES ARE ABOUT FIFTEEN TO EIGHTEEN INCHES LONG AND THREE IN DIAMETER
597-127694-0027 GREEN SHADED WITH DARK PURPLE ON THEIR SUNWARD SIDES THEY ARE RIPE IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER OF THE SECOND YEAR FROM THE FLOWER
597-127694-0028 AND CONTINUE EFFECTIVELY BEAUTIFUL EVEN ON THE GROUND MANY YEARS AFTER THEY FALL THE WOOD IS DELICIOUSLY FRAGRANT FINE IN GRAIN AND TEXTURE AND CREAMY YELLOW AS IF FORMED OF CONDENSED SUNBEAMS
597-127694-0029 THE SUGAR FROM WHICH THE COMMON NAME IS DERIVED IS I THINK THE BEST OF SWEETS IT EXUDES FROM THE HEART WOOD WHERE WOUNDS HAVE BEEN MADE BY FOREST FIRES OR THE AX AND FORMS IRREGULAR CRISP
597-127694-0030 CANDY LIKE KERNELS OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE SOMETHING LIKE CLUSTERS OF RESIN BEADS WHEN FRESH IT IS WHITE BUT BECAUSE MOST OF THE WOUNDS ON WHICH IT IS FOUND HAVE BEEN MADE BY FIRE
597-127694-0031 THE SAP IS STAINED AND THE HARDENED SUGAR BECOMES BROWN INDIANS ARE FOND OF IT BUT ON ACCOUNT OF ITS LAXATIVE PROPERTIES ONLY SMALL QUANTITIES MAY BE EATEN
597-127694-0032 NO TREE LOVER WILL EVER FORGET HIS FIRST MEETING WITH THE SUGAR PINE IN MOST PINE TREES THERE IS THE SAMENESS OF EXPRESSION WHICH TO MOST PEOPLE IS APT TO BECOME MONOTONOUS
597-127694-0033 NO TWO ARE ALIKE AND THOUGH THEY TOSS OUT THEIR IMMENSE ARMS IN WHAT MIGHT SEEM EXTRAVAGANT GESTURES THEY NEVER LOSE THEIR EXPRESSION OF SERENE MAJESTY
597-127694-0034 THEY ARE THE PRIESTS OF PINES AND SEEM EVER TO BE ADDRESSING THE SURROUNDING FOREST THE YELLOW PINE IS FOUND GROWING WITH THEM ON WARM HILLSIDES AND THE SILVER FIR ON COOL NORTHERN SLOPES BUT
597-127694-0035 NOBLE AS THESE ARE THE SUGAR PINE IS EASILY KING AND SPREADS HIS ARMS ABOVE THEM IN BLESSING WHILE THEY ROCK AND WAVE IN SIGN OF RECOGNITION THE MAIN BRANCHES ARE SOMETIMES FORTY FEET LONG YET PERSISTENTLY SIMPLE
597-127694-0036 SELDOM DIVIDING AT ALL EXCEPTING NEAR THE END BUT ANYTHING LIKE A BARE CABLE APPEARANCE IS PREVENTED BY THE SMALL TASSELED BRANCHLETS THAT EXTEND ALL AROUND THEM AND WHEN THESE SUPERB LIMBS SWEEP OUT SYMMETRICALLY ON ALL SIDES
597-127694-0037 A CROWN SIXTY OR SEVENTY FEET WIDE IS FORMED WHICH GRACEFULLY POISED ON THE SUMMIT OF THE NOBLE SHAFT IS A GLORIOUS OBJECT COMMONLY HOWEVER THERE IS A PREPONDERANCE OF LIMBS TOWARD THE EAST
597-127694-0038 AWAY FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE PREVAILING WINDS ALTHOUGH SO UNCONVENTIONAL WHEN FULL GROWN THE SUGAR PINE IS A REMARKABLY PROPER TREE IN YOUTH A STRICT FOLLOWER OF CONIFEROUS FASHIONS
597-127694-0039 SLIM ERECT WITH LEAFY BRANCHES KEPT EXACTLY IN PLACE EACH TAPERING IN OUTLINE AND TERMINATING IN A SPIRY POINT THE SUCCESSIVE FORMS BETWEEN THE CAUTIOUS NEATNESS OF YOUTH AND THE BOLD FREEDOM OF MATURITY
597-127694-0040 OFFER A DELIGHTFUL STUDY AT THE AGE OF FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS THE SHY FASHIONABLE FORM BEGINS TO BE BROKEN UP
597-127694-0041 ITS MOST CONSTANT COMPANION IS THE YELLOW PINE
597-127694-0042 THE DOUGLAS SPRUCE LIBOCEDRUS SEQUOIA AND THE SILVER FIR ARE ALSO MORE OR LESS ASSOCIATED WITH IT BUT ON MANY DEEP SOILED MOUNTAIN SIDES AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA
597-127694-0043 IT FORMS THE BULK OF THE FOREST FILLING EVERY SWELL AND HOLLOW AND DOWN PLUNGING RAVINE THE MAJESTIC CROWNS APPROACHING EACH OTHER IN BOLD CURVES MAKE A GLORIOUS CANOPY THROUGH WHICH THE TEMPERED SUNBEAMS POUR
597-127694-0044 SILVERING THE NEEDLES AND GILDING THE MASSIVE BOLES AND THE FLOWERY PARK LIKE GROUND INTO A SCENE OF ENCHANTMENT ON THE MOST SUNNY SLOPES THE WHITE FLOWERED FRAGRANT CHAMAEBATIA IS SPREAD LIKE A CARPET
597-127694-0045 BRIGHTENED DURING EARLY SUMMER WITH THE CRIMSON SARCODES THE WILD ROSE
597-127694-0046 BUT NOT SO DENSELY AS TO PREVENT THE TRAVELER FROM SAUNTERING WHERE HE WILL
