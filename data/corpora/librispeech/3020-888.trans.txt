3020-888-0000 I REMEMBER LAUGHING AT THE PHRASE ACCEPT THE SITUATION WHICH SHE SEEMED TO REPEAT WITH A GRAVITY TOO INTENSE I SAID TO HER SOMETHING LIKE IT'S HARDLY AS MUCH AS THAT I MEAN
3020-888-0001 THAT I MUST CLAIM THE LIBERTY OF A FREE AMERICAN CITIZEN TO THINK WHAT I PLEASE ABOUT YOUR CO RELIGIONISTS AND I SUPPOSE THAT FLORENCE MUST HAVE LIBERTY TO THINK WHAT SHE PLEASES AND TO SAY WHAT
3020-888-0002 POLITENESS ALLOWS HER TO SAY SHE HAD BETTER LEONORA ANSWERED NOT SAY ONE SINGLE WORD AGAINST MY PEOPLE OR MY FAITH IT STRUCK ME AT THE TIME THAT THERE WAS AN UNUSUAL
3020-888-0003 AN ALMOST THREATENING HARDNESS IN HER VOICE IT WAS ALMOST AS IF SHE WERE TRYING TO CONVEY TO FLORENCE THROUGH ME THAT SHE WOULD SERIOUSLY HARM MY WIFE IF FLORENCE WENT TO SOMETHING THAT WAS AN EXTREME
3020-888-0004 YES I REMEMBER THINKING AT THE TIME THAT IT WAS ALMOST AS IF LEONORA WERE SAYING THROUGH ME TO FLORENCE YOU MAY OUTRAGE ME AS YOU WILL YOU MAY TAKE ALL THAT I PERSONALLY POSSESS BUT DO NOT
3020-888-0005 YOU CARE TO SAY ONE SINGLE THING IN VIEW OF THE SITUATION THAT THAT WILL SET UP AGAINST THE FAITH THAT MAKES ME BECOME THE DOORMAT FOR YOUR FEET BUT OBVIOUSLY AS I SAW IT THAT COULD NOT BE HER MEANING
3020-888-0006 GOOD PEOPLE BE THEY EVER SO DIVERSE IN CREED DO NOT THREATEN EACH OTHER
3020-888-0007 IT WOULD BE BETTER IF FLORENCE SAID NOTHING AT ALL AGAINST MY CO RELIGIONISTS BECAUSE IT IS A POINT THAT I AM TOUCHY ABOUT
3020-888-0008 SHE AND EDWARD CAME DOWN FROM THE TOWER AND I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT FROM THAT MOMENT UNTIL AFTER EDWARD AND THE GIRL AND FLORENCE WERE ALL DEAD TOGETHER I HAD NEVER THE REMOTEST GLIMPSE NOT THE SHADOW OF A SUSPICION THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG
3020-888-0009 AS THE SAYING IS FOR FIVE MINUTES THEN I ENTERTAINED THE POSSIBILITY THAT LEONORA MIGHT BE JEALOUS BUT THERE WAS NEVER ANOTHER FLICKER IN THAT FLAME LIKE PERSONALITY HOW IN THE WORLD SHOULD I GET IT FOR ALL THAT TIME
3020-888-0010 I WAS JUST A MALE SICK NURSE AND WHAT CHANCE HAD I AGAINST THOSE THREE HARDENED GAMBLERS WHO WERE ALL IN LEAGUE TO CONCEAL THEIR HANDS FROM ME WHAT EARTHLY CHANCE THEY WERE THREE TO ONE
3020-888-0011 AND THEY MADE ME HAPPY OH GOD THEY MADE ME SO HAPPY THAT I DOUBT IF EVEN PARADISE THAT SHALL SMOOTH OUT ALL TEMPORAL WRONGS SHALL EVER GIVE ME THE LIKE
3020-888-0012 AND WHAT COULD THEY HAVE DONE BETTER OR WHAT COULD THEY HAVE DONE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE I DON'T KNOW I SUPPOSE THAT DURING ALL THAT TIME I WAS A DECEIVED HUSBAND AND THAT LEONORA WAS PIMPING FOR EDWARD
3020-888-0013 THAT WAS THE CROSS THAT SHE HAD TO TAKE UP DURING HER LONG CALVARY OF A LIFE YOU ASK HOW IT FEELS TO BE A DECEIVED HUSBAND JUST HEAVENS I DO NOT KNOW IT FEELS JUST NOTHING AT ALL
3020-888-0014 IT IS NOT HELL CERTAINLY IT IS NOT NECESSARILY HEAVEN SO I SUPPOSE IT IS THE INTERMEDIATE STAGE WHAT DO THEY CALL IT LIMBO NO I FEEL NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT THAT THEY ARE DEAD
3020-888-0015 THEY HAVE GONE BEFORE THEIR JUDGE WHO I HOPE WILL OPEN TO THEM THE SPRINGS OF HIS COMPASSION IT IS NOT MY BUSINESS TO THINK ABOUT IT IT IS SIMPLY MY BUSINESS TO SAY AS LEONORA'S PEOPLE SAY REQUIEM AETERNAM
3020-888-0016 MEMORIA AETERNA ERIT BUT
3020-888-0017 THE JUST THE UNJUST GOD KNOWS I THINK THAT THE PAIR OF THEM WERE ONLY POOR WRETCHES CREEPING OVER THIS EARTH IN THE SHADOW OF AN ETERNAL WRATH IT IS VERY TERRIBLE
3020-888-0018 IT IS ALMOST TOO TERRIBLE THE PICTURE OF THAT JUDGEMENT AS IT APPEARS TO ME SOMETIMES AT NIGHTS IT IS PROBABLY THE SUGGESTION OF SOME PICTURE THAT I HAVE SEEN SOMEWHERE BUT UPON AN IMMENSE PLAIN SUSPENDED IN MID AIR
3020-888-0019 I SEEM TO SEE THREE FIGURES TWO OF THEM CLASPED CLOSE IN AN INTENSE EMBRACE AND ONE INTOLERABLY SOLITARY IT IS IN BLACK AND WHITE MY PICTURE OF THAT JUDGEMENT AN ETCHING PERHAPS
3020-888-0020 ONLY I CANNOT TELL AN ETCHING FROM A PHOTOGRAPHIC REPRODUCTION AND THE IMMENSE PLAIN IS THE HAND OF GOD STRETCHING OUT FOR MILES AND MILES WITH GREAT SPACES ABOVE IT AND BELOW IT
3020-888-0021 AND THEY ARE IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND IT IS FLORENCE THAT IS ALONE AND DO YOU KNOW AT THE THOUGHT OF THAT INTENSE SOLITUDE I FEEL AN OVERWHELMING DESIRE TO RUSH FORWARD AND COMFORT HER
3020-888-0022 YOU CANNOT YOU SEE HAVE ACTED AS NURSE TO A PERSON FOR TWELVE YEARS WITHOUT WISHING TO GO ON NURSING THEM EVEN THOUGH YOU HATE THEM WITH THE HATRED OF THE ADDER AND EVEN IN THE PALM OF GOD
3020-888-0023 BUT IN THE NIGHTS WITH THAT VISION OF JUDGEMENT BEFORE ME I KNOW THAT I HOLD MYSELF BACK FOR I HATE FLORENCE I HATE FLORENCE WITH SUCH A HATRED THAT I WOULD NOT SPARE HER AN ETERNITY OF LONELINESS
3020-888-0024 SHE NEED NOT HAVE DONE WHAT SHE DID SHE WAS AN AMERICAN A NEW ENGLANDER SHE HAD NOT THE HOT PASSIONS OF THESE EUROPEANS SHE CUT OUT THAT POOR IMBECILE OF AN EDWARD AND I PRAY
3020-888-0025 GOD THAT HE IS REALLY AT PEACE CLASPED CLOSE IN THE ARMS OF THAT POOR POOR GIRL AND NO DOUBT MAISIE MAIDAN WILL FIND HER YOUNG HUSBAND AGAIN AND LEONORA WILL BURN CLEAR AND SERENE
3020-888-0026 A NORTHERN LIGHT AND ONE OF THE ARCHANGELS OF GOD AND ME
3020-888-0027 IT WAS PLAYING IT TOO LOW DOWN SHE CUT OUT POOR DEAR EDWARD FROM SHEER VANITY
3020-888-0028 WHILST SHE WAS EDWARD'S MISTRESS
3020-888-0029 SHE WOULD GABBLE ON TO LEONORA ABOUT FORGIVENESS TREATING THE SUBJECT FROM THE BRIGHT AMERICAN POINT OF VIEW AND LEONORA WOULD TREAT HER LIKE THE WHORE SHE WAS ONCE SHE SAID TO FLORENCE IN THE EARLY MORNING
3020-888-0030 YOU COME TO ME STRAIGHT OUT OF HIS BED TO TELL ME THAT THAT IS MY PROPER PLACE I KNOW IT THANK YOU BUT EVEN THAT COULD NOT STOP FLORENCE SHE WENT ON SAYING THAT IT WAS HER AMBITION TO LEAVE THIS WORLD A LITTLE BRIGHTER
3020-888-0031 BY THE PASSAGE OF HER BRIEF LIFE AND HOW THANKFULLY SHE WOULD LEAVE EDWARD WHOM SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD BROUGHT TO A RIGHT FRAME OF MIND IF LEONORA WOULD ONLY GIVE HIM A CHANCE HE NEEDED SHE SAID TENDERNESS BEYOND ANYTHING
3020-888-0032 AND COMMITTING ADULTERY IN HIRED ROOMS I KNOW THE PAIR OF YOU YOU KNOW NO I PREFER THE SITUATION AS IT IS HALF THE TIME FLORENCE WOULD IGNORE LEONORA'S REMARKS SHE WOULD THINK THEY WERE NOT QUITE LADYLIKE THE OTHER HALF OF THE TIME
3020-888-0033 SHE WOULD TRY TO PERSUADE LEONORA THAT HER LOVE FOR EDWARD WAS QUITE SPIRITUAL ON ACCOUNT OF HER HEART ONCE SHE SAID
3020-888-0034 WHY CANNOT YOU BELIEVE IT OF ME LEONORA WAS I UNDERSTAND
3020-888-0035 SHE LOOKED ROUND COOLLY AND CALMLY AND SAID NEVER DO YOU DARE TO MENTION MISSUS MAIDAN'S NAME AGAIN YOU MURDERED HER YOU AND I MURDERED HER BETWEEN US I AM AS MUCH A SCOUNDREL AS YOU I DON'T LIKE TO BE REMINDED OF IT
3020-888-0036 FLORENCE WENT OFF AT ONCE INTO A BABBLE OF HOW COULD SHE HAVE HURT A PERSON WHOM SHE HARDLY KNEW A PERSON WHOM WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS IN PURSUANCE OF HER EFFORTS TO LEAVE THE WORLD A LITTLE BRIGHTER SHE HAD TRIED TO SAVE FROM EDWARD
3020-888-0037 THAT WAS HOW SHE FIGURED IT OUT TO HERSELF SHE REALLY THOUGHT THAT SO LEONORA SAID PATIENTLY VERY WELL JUST PUT IT THAT I KILLED HER AND THAT IT'S A PAINFUL SUBJECT
3020-888-0038 ONE DOES NOT LIKE TO THINK THAT ONE HAD KILLED SOMEONE NATURALLY NOT I OUGHT NEVER TO HAVE BROUGHT HER FROM INDIA AND THAT INDEED IS EXACTLY HOW LEONORA LOOKED AT IT
3020-888-0039 WHAT HAD HAPPENED ON THE DAY OF OUR JAUNT TO THE ANCIENT CITY OF M HAD BEEN THIS LEONORA WHO HAD BEEN EVEN THEN FILLED WITH PITY AND CONTRITION FOR THE POOR CHILD ON RETURNING TO OUR HOTEL
3020-888-0040 HAD GONE STRAIGHT TO MISSUS MAIDAN'S ROOM SHE HAD WANTED JUST TO PET HER AND SHE HAD PERCEIVED AT FIRST ONLY ON THE CLEAR ROUND TABLE COVERED WITH RED VELVET A LETTER ADDRESSED TO HER IT RAN SOMETHING LIKE OH
3020-888-0041 MISSUS ASHBURNHAM HOW COULD YOU HAVE DONE IT I TRUSTED YOU SO YOU NEVER TALKED TO ME ABOUT ME AND EDWARD BUT I TRUSTED YOU
3020-888-0042 IN THE HALL THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IT EDWARD AND THE AMERICAN LADY YOU PAID THE MONEY FOR ME TO COME HERE OH HOW COULD YOU HOW COULD YOU I AM GOING STRAIGHT BACK TO BUNNY BUNNY WAS MISSUS MAIDAN'S HUSBAND
3020-888-0043 AND LEONORA SAID THAT AS SHE WENT ON READING THE LETTER SHE HAD WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND HER A SENSE THAT THAT HOTEL ROOM WAS CLEARED THAT THERE WERE NO PAPERS ON THE TABLE
3020-888-0044 THAT THERE WERE NO CLOTHES ON THE HOOKS AND THAT THERE WAS A STRAINED SILENCE A SILENCE SHE SAID
3020-888-0045 THAT DRANK UP SUCH SOUNDS AS THERE WERE
3020-888-0046 WHILST SHE READ THE POSTSCRIPT OF THE LETTER I DID NOT KNOW YOU WANTED ME FOR AN ADULTERESS THE POSTSCRIPT BEGAN THE POOR CHILD WAS HARDLY LITERATE IT WAS SURELY NOT RIGHT OF YOU AND I NEVER WANTED TO BE ONE
3020-888-0047 AND I HEARD EDWARD CALL ME A POOR LITTLE RAT TO THE AMERICAN LADY HE ALWAYS CALLED ME A LITTLE RAT IN PRIVATE AND I DID NOT MIND BUT IF HE CALLED ME IT TO HER I THINK HE DOES NOT LOVE ME ANY MORE
3020-888-0048 OH MISSUS ASHBURNHAM YOU KNEW THE WORLD AND I KNEW NOTHING I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT IF YOU THOUGHT IT COULD AND I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BROUGHT ME IF YOU DID NOT TOO
3020-888-0049 OUT OF THE SAME CONVENT LEONORA SAID THAT SHE SCREAMED WHEN SHE READ THAT AND THEN SHE SAW THAT MAISIE'S BOXES WERE ALL PACKED AND SHE BEGAN A SEARCH FOR MISSUS MAIDAN HERSELF ALL OVER THE HOTEL THE MANAGER SAID THAT MISSUS MAIDAN HAD PAID HER BILL
3020-888-0050 AND HAD GONE UP TO THE STATION TO ASK
3020-888-0051 TO MAKE HER OUT A PLAN FOR HER IMMEDIATE RETURN TO CHITRAL HE IMAGINED THAT HE HAD SEEN HER COME BACK BUT HE WAS NOT QUITE CERTAIN NO ONE IN THE LARGE HOTEL HAD BOTHERED HIS HEAD ABOUT THE CHILD
3020-888-0052 AND SHE WANDERING SOLITARILY IN THE HALL HAD NO DOUBT SAT DOWN BESIDE A SCREEN THAT HAD EDWARD AND FLORENCE ON THE OTHER SIDE I NEVER HEARD THEN OR AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THAT PRECIOUS COUPLE
3020-888-0053 AS TO THE RAVAGES HE MIGHT BE MAKING IN THE GIRL'S HEART THAT WOULD BE THE SORT OF WAY SHE WOULD BEGIN AND EDWARD WOULD HAVE SENTIMENTALLY ASSURED HER
3020-888-0054 THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT THAT MAISIE WAS JUST A POOR LITTLE RAT WHOSE PASSAGE TO NAUHEIM HIS WIFE HAD PAID OUT OF HER OWN POCKET THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO DO THE TRICK FOR THE TRICK WAS PRETTY EFFICIENTLY DONE
3020-888-0055 LEONORA WITH PANIC GROWING AND WITH CONTRITION VERY LARGE IN HER HEART VISITED EVERY ONE OF THE PUBLIC ROOMS OF THE HOTEL THE DINING ROOM THE LOUNGE
3020-888-0056 THE WINTER GARDEN GOD KNOWS WHAT THEY WANTED WITH A WINTER GARDEN
3020-888-0057 AND THEN LEONORA RAN YES SHE RAN UP THE STAIRS TO
3020-888-0058 SHE HAD DETERMINED TO TAKE THAT CHILD RIGHT AWAY FROM THAT HIDEOUS PLACE IT SEEMED TO HER TO BE ALL UNSPEAKABLE I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT SHE WAS NOT QUITE COOL ABOUT IT LEONORA WAS ALWAYS LEONORA
3020-888-0059 BUT THE COLD JUSTICE OF THE THING DEMANDED THAT SHE SHOULD PLAY THE PART OF MOTHER TO THIS CHILD WHO HAD COME FROM THE SAME CONVENT SHE FIGURED IT OUT TO AMOUNT TO THAT SHE WOULD LEAVE EDWARD TO FLORENCE AND TO ME
3020-888-0060 AND SHE WOULD DEVOTE ALL HER TIME TO PROVIDING THAT CHILD WITH AN ATMOSPHERE OF LOVE UNTIL SHE COULD BE RETURNED TO HER POOR YOUNG HUSBAND IT WAS NATURALLY TOO LATE SHE HAD NOT CARED TO LOOK ROUND MAISIE'S ROOMS AT FIRST
3020-888-0061 NOW AS SOON AS SHE CAME IN SHE PERCEIVED STICKING OUT BEYOND THE BED A SMALL PAIR OF FEET IN HIGH HEELED SHOES MAISIE HAD DIED IN THE EFFORT TO STRAP UP A GREAT PORTMANTEAU SHE HAD DIED SO GROTESQUELY
3020-888-0062 THAT HER LITTLE BODY HAD FALLEN FORWARD INTO THE TRUNK AND IT HAD CLOSED UPON HER LIKE THE JAWS OF A GIGANTIC ALLIGATOR THE KEY WAS IN HER HAND HER DARK HAIR
3020-888-0063 LIKE THE HAIR OF A JAPANESE HAD COME DOWN AND COVERED HER BODY AND HER FACE LEONORA LIFTED HER UP SHE WAS THE MEREST FEATHERWEIGHT AND LAID HER ON THE BED WITH HER HAIR ABOUT HER SHE WAS SMILING
3020-888-0064 I SAW HER WITH THE LONG LASHES ON THE CHEEKS WITH THE SMILE ABOUT THE LIPS WITH THE FLOWERS ALL ABOUT HER THE STEM OF A WHITE LILY RESTED IN HER HAND SO THAT THE SPIKE OF FLOWERS WAS UPON HER SHOULDER
3020-888-0065 SHE LOOKED LIKE A BRIDE IN THE SUNLIGHT OF THE MORTUARY CANDLES THAT WERE ALL ABOUT HER AND THE WHITE COIFS OF THE TWO NUNS THAT KNELT AT HER FEET WITH THEIR FACES HIDDEN MIGHT HAVE BEEN TWO SWANS THAT WERE TO BEAR HER AWAY
3020-888-0066 OR WHEREVER IT IS LEONORA SHOWED HER TO ME SHE WOULD NOT LET EITHER OF THE OTHERS SEE HER SHE WANTED YOU KNOW TO SPARE POOR DEAR EDWARD'S FEELINGS HE NEVER COULD BEAR THE SIGHT OF A CORPSE AND
