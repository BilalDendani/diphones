6051-61724-0003 WHICH TOLD THEM THAT IN ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE THEY MIGHT GET A BULLET IN THE BACK THERE WAS AN INTERVAL SOME SIX SECONDS OF SILENCE DURING WHICH A PIN MIGHT HAVE BEEN HEARD FALLING UPON THE FLOOR IT WAS BUT THE INTERLUDE THAT OFTEN OCCURS BETWEEN RESOLUTION AND ACTION
6051-61724-0004 WHEN THE MIND HAS COMPLETED ITS TASK AND THE BODY HAS YET TO BEGIN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE BRIEF WITH OTHER ACTORS ON THE SCENE TWO ORDINARY MEN WOULD HAVE BLAZED AWAY AT ONCE AND WITHOUT REFLECTION
6051-61724-0005 BUT THE TWO NOW CONFRONTING EACH OTHER WERE NOT OF THE COMMON KIND BOTH HAD SEEN STREET FIGHTING BEFORE HAD TAKEN PART IN IT AND KNEW THE DISADVANTAGE OF AN IDLE SHOT
6051-61724-0006 EACH WAS DETERMINED TO TAKE SURE AIM ON THE OTHER IT WAS THIS THAT PROLONGED THE INTERVAL OF INACTION TO THOSE OUTSIDE WHO DARED NOT EVEN LOOK THROUGH THE DOORS THE SUSPENSE WAS ALMOST PAINFUL THE CRACKING OF THE PISTOLS WHICH THEY EXPECTED EVERY MOMENT TO HEAR
