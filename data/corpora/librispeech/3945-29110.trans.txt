3945-29110-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY NINE PHILIP STERLING WAS ON HIS WAY TO ILIUM IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA ILIUM WAS THE RAILWAY STATION NEAREST TO THE TRACT OF WILD LAND WHICH MISTER BOLTON HAD COMMISSIONED HIM TO EXAMINE
3945-29110-0001 ON THE LAST DAY OF THE JOURNEY AS THE RAILWAY TRAIN PHILIP WAS ON WAS LEAVING A LARGE CITY A LADY TIMIDLY ENTERED THE DRAWING ROOM CAR AND HESITATINGLY TOOK A CHAIR THAT WAS AT THE MOMENT UNOCCUPIED
3945-29110-0002 PHILIP SAW FROM THE WINDOW THAT A GENTLEMAN HAD PUT HER UPON THE CAR JUST AS IT WAS STARTING IN A FEW MOMENTS THE CONDUCTOR ENTERED AND WITHOUT WAITING AN EXPLANATION SAID ROUGHLY TO THE LADY NOW YOU CAN'T SIT THERE THAT SEAT'S TAKEN
3945-29110-0003 GO INTO THE OTHER CAR I DID NOT INTEND TO TAKE THE SEAT SAID THE LADY RISING I ONLY SAT DOWN A MOMENT TILL THE CONDUCTOR SHOULD COME AND GIVE ME A SEAT THERE AINT ANY CAR'S FULL YOU'LL HAVE TO LEAVE BUT SIR SAID THE LADY APPEALINGLY I THOUGHT
3945-29110-0004 CAN'T HELP WHAT YOU THOUGHT YOU MUST GO INTO THE OTHER CAR THE TRAIN IS GOING VERY FAST LET ME STAND HERE TILL WE STOP THE LADY CAN HAVE MY SEAT CRIED PHILIP SPRINGING UP
3945-29110-0005 THE CONDUCTOR TURNED TOWARDS PHILIP AND COOLLY AND DELIBERATELY SURVEYED HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT WITH CONTEMPT IN EVERY LINE OF HIS FACE TURNED HIS BACK UPON HIM WITHOUT A WORD AND SAID TO THE LADY COME I'VE GOT NO TIME TO TALK YOU MUST GO NOW
3945-29110-0006 THE LADY ENTIRELY DISCONCERTED BY SUCH RUDENESS AND FRIGHTENED MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR OPENED IT AND STEPPED OUT THE TRAIN WAS SWINGING ALONG AT A RAPID RATE JARRING FROM SIDE TO SIDE
3945-29110-0007 SHE WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE GONE DOWN UNDER THE WHEELS IF PHILIP WHO HAD SWIFTLY FOLLOWED HER HAD NOT CAUGHT HER ARM AND DRAWN HER UP HE THEN ASSISTED HER ACROSS FOUND HER A SEAT RECEIVED HER BEWILDERED THANKS AND RETURNED TO HIS CAR
3945-29110-0008 THE CONDUCTOR WAS STILL THERE TAKING HIS TICKETS AND GROWLING SOMETHING ABOUT IMPOSITION PHILIP MARCHED UP TO HIM AND BURST OUT WITH YOU ARE A BRUTE AN INFERNAL BRUTE TO TREAT A WOMAN THAT WAY
3945-29110-0009 PHILIP'S REPLY WAS A BLOW GIVEN SO SUDDENLY AND PLANTED SO SQUARELY IN THE CONDUCTOR'S FACE THAT IT SENT HIM REELING OVER A FAT PASSENGER WHO WAS LOOKING UP IN MILD WONDER THAT ANY ONE SHOULD DARE TO DISPUTE WITH A CONDUCTOR AND AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE CAR
3945-29110-0010 HE RECOVERED HIMSELF REACHED THE BELL ROPE DAMN YOU I'LL LEARN YOU STEPPED TO THE DOOR AND CALLED A COUPLE OF BRAKEMEN AND THEN AS THE SPEED SLACKENED ROARED OUT GET OFF THIS TRAIN
3945-29110-0011 I SHALL NOT GET OFF I HAVE AS MUCH RIGHT HERE AS YOU WE'LL SEE SAID THE CONDUCTOR ADVANCING WITH THE BRAKEMEN THE PASSENGERS PROTESTED AND SOME OF THEM SAID TO EACH OTHER THAT'S TOO BAD AS THEY ALWAYS DO IN SUCH CASES
3945-29110-0012 THE MEN SEIZED HIM WRENCHED HIM FROM HIS SEAT DRAGGED HIM ALONG THE AISLE TEARING HIS CLOTHES THRUST HIM FROM THE CAR AND THEN FLUNG HIS CARPET BAG OVERCOAT AND UMBRELLA AFTER HIM AND THE TRAIN WENT ON THE CONDUCTOR
3945-29110-0013 RED IN THE FACE AND PUFFING FROM HIS EXERTION
3945-29110-0014 GOD SAVE THE MARK ATTEMPTED TO FORCE HERSELF INTO THE ALREADY FULL PALATIAL CAR CONDUCTOR SLUM WHO IS TOO OLD A BIRD TO BE CAUGHT WITH CHAFF COURTEOUSLY INFORMED HER THAT THE CAR WAS FULL AND WHEN SHE INSISTED ON REMAINING HE PERSUADED HER TO GO INTO THE CAR WHERE SHE BELONGED
3945-29110-0015 THEREUPON A YOUNG SPRIG FROM THE EAST BLUSTERED LIKE A SHANGHAI ROOSTER AND BEGAN TO SASS THE CONDUCTOR WITH HIS CHIN MUSIC THAT GENTLEMAN DELIVERED THE YOUNG ASPIRANT FOR A MUSS ONE OF HIS ELEGANT LITTLE LEFT HANDERS WHICH SO ASTONISHED HIM THAT HE BEGAN TO FEEL FOR HIS SHOOTER
3945-29110-0016 WHEREUPON MISTER SLUM GENTLY RAISED THE YOUTH CARRIED HIM FORTH AND SET HIM DOWN JUST OUTSIDE THE CAR TO COOL OFF WHETHER THE YOUNG BLOOD HAS YET MADE HIS WAY OUT OF BASCOM'S SWAMP WE HAVE NOT LEARNED CONDUCTOR SLUM IS ONE OF THE MOST GENTLEMANLY AND EFFICIENT OFFICERS ON THE ROAD
3945-29110-0017 BUT HE AIN'T TRIFLED WITH NOT MUCH WE LEARN THAT THE COMPANY HAVE PUT A NEW ENGINE ON THE SEVEN O'CLOCK TRAIN AND NEWLY UPHOLSTERED THE DRAWING ROOM CAR THROUGHOUT IT SPARES NO EFFORT FOR THE COMFORT OF THE TRAVELING PUBLIC
3945-29110-0018 PHILIP NEVER HAD BEEN BEFORE IN BASCOM'S SWAMP AND THERE WAS NOTHING INVITING IN IT TO DETAIN HIM AFTER THE TRAIN GOT OUT OF THE WAY HE CRAWLED OUT OF THE BRIARS AND THE MUD AND GOT UPON THE TRACK HE WAS SOMEWHAT BRUISED BUT HE WAS TOO ANGRY TO MIND THAT
3945-29110-0019 HE PLODDED ALONG OVER THE TIES IN A VERY HOT CONDITION OF MIND AND BODY IN THE SCUFFLE HIS RAILWAY CHECK HAD DISAPPEARED AND HE GRIMLY WONDERED AS HE NOTICED THE LOSS IF THE COMPANY WOULD PERMIT HIM TO WALK OVER THEIR TRACK IF THEY SHOULD KNOW HE HADN'T A TICKET
3945-29110-0020 PHILIP HAD TO WALK SOME FIVE MILES BEFORE HE REACHED A LITTLE STATION WHERE HE COULD WAIT FOR A TRAIN AND HE HAD AMPLE TIME FOR REFLECTION AT FIRST HE WAS FULL OF VENGEANCE ON THE COMPANY HE WOULD SUE IT HE WOULD MAKE IT PAY ROUNDLY
3945-29110-0021 WAS ABOUT THE MOST HOPELESS IN THE WORLD HE THEN THOUGHT HE WOULD SEEK OUT THAT CONDUCTOR LIE IN WAIT FOR HIM AT SOME STATION AND THRASH HIM OR GET THRASHED HIMSELF BUT AS HE GOT COOLER THAT DID NOT SEEM TO HIM A PROJECT WORTHY OF A GENTLEMAN EXACTLY
3945-29110-0022 WAS IT POSSIBLE FOR A GENTLEMAN TO GET EVEN WITH SUCH A FELLOW AS THAT CONDUCTOR ON THE LETTER'S OWN PLANE AND WHEN HE CAME TO THIS POINT HE BEGAN TO ASK HIMSELF IF HE HAD NOT ACTED VERY MUCH LIKE A FOOL HE DIDN'T REGRET STRIKING THE FELLOW
3945-29110-0023 HE HOPED HE HAD LEFT A MARK ON HIM BUT AFTER ALL WAS THAT THE BEST WAY HERE WAS HE PHILIP STERLING CALLING HIMSELF A GENTLEMAN IN A BRAWL WITH A VULGAR CONDUCTOR ABOUT A WOMAN HE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
3945-29110-0024 WHY SHOULD HE HAVE PUT HIMSELF IN SUCH A RIDICULOUS POSITION WASN'T IT ENOUGH TO HAVE OFFERED THE LADY HIS SEAT TO HAVE RESCUED HER FROM AN ACCIDENT PERHAPS FROM DEATH SUPPOSE HE HAD SIMPLY SAID TO THE CONDUCTOR SIR YOUR CONDUCT IS BRUTAL I SHALL REPORT YOU
3945-29110-0025 THE PASSENGERS WHO SAW THE AFFAIR MIGHT HAVE JOINED IN A REPORT AGAINST THE CONDUCTOR AND HE MIGHT REALLY HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING AND NOW PHILIP LOOKED AT HIS TORN CLOTHES AND THOUGHT WITH DISGUST OF HIS HASTE IN GETTING INTO A FIGHT WITH SUCH AN AUTOCRAT
3945-29110-0026 AT THE LITTLE STATION WHERE PHILIP WAITED FOR THE NEXT TRAIN HE MET A MAN WHO TURNED OUT TO BE A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND TOLD HIM HIS ADVENTURE HE WAS A KINDLY SORT OF MAN AND SEEMED VERY MUCH INTERESTED
3945-29110-0027 WAL I GUESS TAIN'T NO USE I HAIN'T A MITE OF DOUBT OF EVERY WORD YOU SAY BUT SUIN'S NO USE THE RAILROAD COMPANY OWNS ALL THESE PEOPLE ALONG HERE AND THE JUDGES ON THE BENCH TOO SPILED YOUR CLOTHES
3945-29110-0028 LEAST SAID'S SOONEST MENDED YOU HAINT NO CHANCE WITH THE COMPANY WHEN NEXT MORNING HE READ THE HUMOROUS ACCOUNT IN THE PATRIOT AND CLARION HE SAW STILL MORE CLEARLY WHAT CHANCE HE WOULD HAVE HAD BEFORE THE PUBLIC IN A FIGHT WITH THE RAILROAD COMPANY
3945-29110-0029 STILL PHILIP'S CONSCIENCE TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS HIS PLAIN DUTY TO CARRY THE MATTER INTO THE COURTS EVEN WITH THE CERTAINTY OF DEFEAT HE CONFESSED THAT NEITHER HE NOR ANY CITIZEN HAD A RIGHT TO CONSULT HIS OWN FEELINGS OR CONSCIENCE IN A CASE WHERE A LAW OF THE LAND HAD BEEN
3945-29110-0030 VIOLATED BEFORE HIS OWN EYES HE CONFESSED THAT EVERY CITIZEN'S FIRST DUTY IN SUCH CASE IS TO PUT ASIDE HIS OWN BUSINESS AND DEVOTE HIS TIME AND HIS BEST EFFORTS TO SEEING THAT THE INFRACTION IS PROMPTLY PUNISHED AND HE KNEW
3945-29110-0031 THAT NO COUNTRY CAN BE WELL GOVERNED UNLESS ITS CITIZENS AS A BODY KEEP RELIGIOUSLY BEFORE THEIR MINDS THAT THEY ARE THE GUARDIANS OF THE LAW AND THAT THE LAW OFFICERS ARE ONLY THE MACHINERY FOR ITS EXECUTION NOTHING MORE
3945-29110-0032 AS A FINALITY HE WAS OBLIGED TO CONFESS THAT HE WAS A BAD CITIZEN AND ALSO THAT THE GENERAL LAXITY OF THE TIME AND THE ABSENCE OF A SENSE OF DUTY TOWARD ANY PART OF THE COMMUNITY BUT THE INDIVIDUAL HIMSELF WERE INGRAINED IN HIM
3945-29110-0033 REST OF THE PEOPLE THE RESULT OF THIS LITTLE ADVENTURE WAS THAT PHILIP DID NOT REACH ILIUM TILL DAYLIGHT THE NEXT MORNING WHEN HE DESCENDED SLEEPY AND SORE FROM A WAY TRAIN AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM ILIUM WAS IN A NARROW MOUNTAIN GORGE
3945-29110-0034 THROUGH WHICH A RAPID STREAM RAN IT CONSISTED OF THE PLANK PLATFORM ON WHICH HE STOOD A WOODEN HOUSE HALF PAINTED WITH A DIRTY PIAZZA UNROOFED IN FRONT AND A SIGN BOARD HUNG ON A SLANTING POLE BEARING THE LEGEND
3945-29110-0035 HOTEL P DUSENHEIMER A SAWMILL FURTHER DOWN THE STREAM A BLACKSMITH SHOP AND A STORE AND THREE OR FOUR UNPAINTED DWELLINGS OF THE SLAB VARIETY
3945-29110-0036 AS PHILIP APPROACHED THE HOTEL HE SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A WILD BEAST CROUCHING ON THE PIAZZA IT DID NOT STIR HOWEVER AND HE SOON FOUND THAT IT WAS ONLY A STUFFED SKIN
3945-29110-0037 THIS CHEERFUL INVITATION TO THE TAVERN WAS THE REMAINS OF A HUGE PANTHER WHICH HAD BEEN KILLED IN THE REGION A FEW WEEKS BEFORE PHILIP EXAMINED HIS UGLY VISAGE AND STRONG CROOKED FORE ARM AS HE WAS WAITING ADMITTANCE
3945-29110-0038 HAVING POUNDED UPON THE DOOR YAIT A BIT I'LL SHOOST PUT ON MY TROWSERS SHOUTED A VOICE FROM THE WINDOW AND THE DOOR WAS SOON OPENED BY THE YAWNING LANDLORD MORGEN
3945-29110-0039 DEM BOYS GEEPS ME UP ZO SPATE GOM RIGHT IN PHILIP WAS SHOWN INTO A DIRTY BAR ROOM IT WAS A SMALL ROOM WITH A STOVE IN THE MIDDLE SET IN A LONG SHALLOW BOX OF SAND FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE SPITTERS
3945-29110-0040 A BAR ACROSS ONE END A MERE COUNTER WITH A SLIDING GLASS CASE BEHIND IT CONTAINING A FEW BOTTLES HAVING AMBITIOUS LABELS AND A WASH SINK IN ONE CORNER ON THE WALLS WERE THE BRIGHT YELLOW AND BLACK HANDBILLS OF A TRAVELING CIRCUS
3945-29110-0041 WITH PICTURES OF ACROBATS IN HUMAN PYRAMIDS HORSES FLYING IN LONG LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR AND SYLPH LIKE WOMEN IN A PARADISAIC COSTUME BALANCING THEMSELVES UPON THE TIPS OF THEIR TOES ON THE BARE BACKS OF FRANTIC AND PLUNGING STEEDS
3945-29110-0042 AND KISSING THEIR HANDS TO THE SPECTATORS MEANWHILE AS PHILIP DID NOT DESIRE A ROOM AT THAT HOUR HE WAS INVITED TO WASH HIMSELF AT THE NASTY SINK A FEAT SOMEWHAT EASIER THAN DRYING HIS FACE
3945-29110-0043 FOR THE TOWEL THAT HUNG IN A ROLLER OVER THE SINK WAS EVIDENTLY AS MUCH A FIXTURE AS THE SINK ITSELF AND BELONGED LIKE THE SUSPENDED BRUSH AND COMB TO THE TRAVELING PUBLIC PHILIP MANAGED TO COMPLETE HIS TOILET BY THE USE OF HIS POCKET HANDKERCHIEF
3945-29110-0044 AND DECLINING THE HOSPITALITY OF THE LANDLORD IMPLIED IN THE REMARK YOU WON'D DAKE NOTIN HE WENT INTO THE OPEN AIR TO WAIT FOR BREAKFAST THE COUNTRY HE SAW WAS WILD BUT NOT PICTURESQUE
3945-29110-0045 THE MOUNTAIN BEFORE HIM MIGHT BE EIGHT HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND WAS ONLY A PORTION OF A LONG UNBROKEN RANGE SAVAGELY WOODED WHICH FOLLOWED THE STREAM BEHIND THE HOTEL AND ACROSS THE BRAWLING BROOK
3945-29110-0046 WAS ANOTHER LEVEL TOPPED WOODED RANGE EXACTLY LIKE IT ILIUM ITSELF SEEN AT A GLANCE WAS OLD ENOUGH TO BE DILAPIDATED AND IF IT HAD GAINED ANYTHING BY BEING MADE A WOOD AND WATER STATION OF THE NEW RAILROAD IT WAS ONLY A NEW SORT OF GRIME AND RAWNESS
3945-29110-0047 P DUSENHEIMER STANDING IN THE DOOR OF HIS UNINVITING GROGGERY WHEN THE TRAINS STOPPED FOR WATER NEVER RECEIVED FROM THE TRAVELING PUBLIC ANY PATRONAGE EXCEPT FACETIOUS REMARKS UPON HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE PERHAPS A THOUSAND TIMES HE HAD HEARD THE REMARK
3945-29110-0048 FOLLOWED IN MOST INSTANCES BY A HAIL TO HIMSELF AS A ENEAS WITH THE INQUIRY WHERE IS OLD ANCHISES AT FIRST HE HAD REPLIED DERE AIN'T NO SUCH MAN BUT IRRITATED BY ITS SENSELESS REPETITION
3945-29110-0049 YOU BE DAM PHILIP WAS RECALLED FROM THE CONTEMPLATION OF ILIUM BY THE ROLLING AND GROWLING OF THE GONG WITHIN THE HOTEL THE DIN AND CLAMOR INCREASING TILL THE HOUSE WAS APPARENTLY UNABLE TO CONTAIN IT
3945-29110-0050 WHEN IT BURST OUT OF THE FRONT DOOR AND INFORMED THE WORLD THAT BREAKFAST WAS ON THE TABLE THE DINING ROOM WAS LONG LOW AND NARROW AND A NARROW TABLE EXTENDED ITS WHOLE LENGTH UPON THIS WAS SPREAD A CLOTH WHICH FROM APPEARANCE
3945-29110-0051 MIGHT HAVE BEEN AS LONG IN USE AS THE TOWEL IN THE BARROOM UPON THE TABLE WAS THE USUAL SERVICE THE HEAVY MUCH NICKED STONE WARE THE ROW OF PLATED AND RUSTY CASTORS THE SUGAR BOWLS WITH THE ZINC TEA SPOONS STICKING UP IN THEM
3945-29110-0052 THE PILES OF YELLOW BISCUITS THE DISCOURAGED LOOKING PLATES OF BUTTER THE LANDLORD WAITED AND PHILIP WAS PLEASED TO OBSERVE THE CHANGE IN HIS MANNER IN THE BARROOM HE WAS THE CONCILIATORY LANDLORD STANDING BEHIND HIS GUESTS AT TABLE
3945-29110-0053 HE HAD AN AIR OF PEREMPTORY PATRONAGE AND THE VOICE IN WHICH HE SHOT OUT THE INQUIRY AS HE SEIZED PHILIP'S PLATE BEEFSTEAK OR LIVER QUITE TOOK AWAY PHILIP'S POWER OF CHOICE HE BEGGED FOR A GLASS OF MILK
3945-29110-0054 AFTER TRYING THAT GREEN HUED COMPOUND CALLED COFFEE AND MADE HIS BREAKFAST OUT OF THAT AND SOME HARD CRACKERS WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN IMPORTED INTO ILIUM BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE IRON HORSE
3945-29110-0055 AND TO HAVE WITHSTOOD A TEN YEARS SIEGE OF REGULAR BOARDERS GREEKS AND OTHERS THE LAND THAT PHILIP HAD COME TO LOOK AT WAS AT LEAST FIVE MILES DISTANT FROM ILIUM STATION A CORNER OF IT TOUCHED THE RAILROAD
3945-29110-0056 BUT THE REST WAS PRETTY MUCH AN UNBROKEN WILDERNESS EIGHT OR TEN THOUSAND ACRES OF ROUGH COUNTRY MOST OF IT SUCH A MOUNTAIN RANGE AS HE SAW AT ILIUM HIS FIRST STEP WAS TO HIRE THREE WOODSMEN TO ACCOMPANY HIM
3945-29110-0057 BY THEIR HELP HE BUILT A LOG HUT AND ESTABLISHED A CAMP ON THE LAND AND THEN BEGAN HIS EXPLORATIONS MAPPING DOWN HIS SURVEY AS HE WENT ALONG NOTING THE TIMBER AND THE LAY OF THE LAND AND MAKING SUPERFICIAL OBSERVATIONS AS TO THE PROSPECT OF COAL
3945-29110-0058 THE LANDLORD AT ILIUM ENDEAVORED TO PERSUADE PHILIP TO HIRE THE SERVICES OF A WITCH HAZEL PROFESSOR OF THAT REGION WHO COULD WALK OVER THE LAND WITH HIS WAND AND TELL HIM INFALLIBLY WHETHER IT CONTAINED COAL AND EXACTLY WHERE THE STRATA RAN
3945-29110-0059 AND HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE GEOLOGICAL FORMATION HE SPENT A MONTH IN TRAVELING OVER THE LAND AND MAKING CALCULATIONS AND MADE UP HIS MIND THAT A FINE VEIN OF COAL RAN THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN ABOUT A MILE FROM THE RAILROAD
3945-29110-0060 AND THAT THE PLACE TO RUN IN A TUNNEL WAS HALF WAY TOWARDS ITS SUMMIT ACTING WITH HIS USUAL PROMPTNESS PHILIP WITH THE CONSENT OF MISTER BOLTON BROKE GROUND THERE AT ONCE AND BEFORE SNOW CAME HAD SOME RUDE BUILDINGS UP
3945-29110-0061 AND WAS READY FOR ACTIVE OPERATIONS IN THE SPRING IT WAS TRUE THAT THERE WERE NO OUTCROPPINGS OF COAL AT THE PLACE
3945-29110-0062 MOUGHT AS WELL DIG FOR PLUG TERBACCER THERE BUT PHILIP HAD GREAT FAITH IN THE UNIFORMITY OF NATURE'S OPERATIONS IN AGES PAST AND HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT HE SHOULD STRIKE AT THIS SPOT THE RICH VEIN
