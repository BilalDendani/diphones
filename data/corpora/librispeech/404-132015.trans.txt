404-132015-0000 AND OF THE COMEDY OF THE PEOPLE OF GENOA AND LUCCA LAYING THEIR PETITIONS BEFORE MONSIEUR BUONAPARTE AND MONSIEUR BUONAPARTE SITTING ON A THRONE AND GRANTING THE PETITIONS OF THE NATIONS ADORABLE
404-132015-0001 PRINCE ANDREW LOOKED ANNA PAVLOVNA STRAIGHT IN THE FACE WITH A SARCASTIC SMILE DIEU ME LA DONNE
404-132015-0002 THEY SAY HE WAS VERY FINE WHEN HE SAID THAT HE REMARKED REPEATING THE WORDS IN ITALIAN
404-132015-0003 I HOPE THIS WILL PROVE THE LAST DROP THAT WILL MAKE THE GLASS RUN OVER ANNA PAVLOVNA CONTINUED
404-132015-0004 I DO NOT SPEAK OF RUSSIA SAID THE VICOMTE
404-132015-0005 PRINCE HIPPOLYTE WHO HAD BEEN GAZING AT THE VICOMTE FOR SOME TIME THROUGH HIS LORGNETTE SUDDENLY TURNED COMPLETELY ROUND TOWARD THE LITTLE PRINCESS AND HAVING ASKED FOR A NEEDLE
404-132015-0006 HE EXPLAINED THIS TO HER WITH AS MUCH GRAVITY AS IF SHE HAD ASKED HIM TO DO IT BATON DE GUEULES ENGRELE DE GUEULES D'AZUR
404-132015-0007 IF BUONAPARTE REMAINS ON THE THRONE OF FRANCE A YEAR LONGER THE VICOMTE CONTINUED WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO IN A MATTER WITH WHICH HE IS BETTER ACQUAINTED THAN ANYONE ELSE DOES NOT LISTEN TO OTHERS BUT FOLLOWS THE CURRENT OF HIS OWN THOUGHTS
404-132015-0008 BY INTRIGUES VIOLENCE EXILE AND EXECUTIONS FRENCH SOCIETY I MEAN GOOD FRENCH SOCIETY WILL HAVE BEEN FOREVER DESTROYED AND THEN
404-132015-0009 PIERRE WISHED TO MAKE A REMARK FOR THE CONVERSATION INTERESTED HIM BUT ANNA PAVLOVNA WHO HAD HIM UNDER OBSERVATION INTERRUPTED THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER
404-132015-0010 SAID SHE WITH THE MELANCHOLY WHICH ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED ANY REFERENCE OF HERS TO THE IMPERIAL FAMILY HAS DECLARED THAT HE WILL LEAVE IT TO THE FRENCH PEOPLE THEMSELVES TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND I BELIEVE
404-132015-0011 THAT ONCE FREE FROM THE USURPER THE WHOLE NATION WILL CERTAINLY THROW ITSELF INTO THE ARMS OF ITS RIGHTFUL KING SHE CONCLUDED TRYING TO BE AMIABLE TO THE ROYALIST EMIGRANT THAT IS DOUBTFUL SAID PRINCE ANDREW
404-132015-0012 MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE QUITE RIGHTLY SUPPOSES THAT MATTERS HAVE ALREADY GONE TOO FAR
404-132015-0013 FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD SAID PIERRE BLUSHING AND BREAKING INTO THE CONVERSATION ALMOST ALL THE ARISTOCRACY HAS ALREADY GONE OVER TO BONAPARTE'S SIDE IT IS THE BUONAPARTISTS WHO SAY THAT
404-132015-0014 AT THE PRESENT TIME IT IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW THE REAL STATE OF FRENCH PUBLIC OPINION BONAPARTE HAS SAID SO REMARKED PRINCE ANDREW WITH A SARCASTIC SMILE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE DID NOT LIKE THE VICOMTE
404-132015-0015 AND WAS AIMING HIS REMARKS AT HIM THOUGH WITHOUT LOOKING AT HIM I SHOWED THEM THE PATH TO GLORY BUT THEY DID NOT FOLLOW IT PRINCE ANDREW CONTINUED AFTER A SHORT SILENCE AGAIN QUOTING NAPOLEON'S WORDS
404-132015-0016 I OPENED MY ANTECHAMBERS AND THEY CROWDED IN I DO NOT KNOW HOW FAR HE WAS JUSTIFIED IN SAYING SO NOT IN THE LEAST REPLIED THE VICOMTE AFTER THE MURDER OF THE DUC
404-132015-0017 EVEN THE MOST PARTIAL CEASED TO REGARD HIM AS A HERO IF TO SOME PEOPLE HE WENT ON TURNING TO ANNA PAVLOVNA
404-132015-0018 AFTER THE MURDER OF THE DUC THERE WAS ONE MARTYR MORE IN HEAVEN AND ONE HERO LESS ON EARTH BEFORE ANNA PAVLOVNA AND THE OTHERS HAD TIME TO SMILE THEIR APPRECIATION OF THE VICOMTE'S EPIGRAM PIERRE AGAIN BROKE INTO THE CONVERSATION
404-132015-0019 AND THOUGH ANNA PAVLOVNA FELT SURE HE WOULD SAY SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE SHE WAS UNABLE TO STOP HIM
404-132015-0020 AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NAPOLEON SHOWED GREATNESS OF SOUL BY NOT FEARING TO TAKE ON HIMSELF THE WHOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THAT DEED DIEU MON DIEU MUTTERED ANNA PAVLOVNA IN A TERRIFIED WHISPER
404-132015-0021 SAID THE LITTLE PRINCESS
404-132015-0022 OH OH EXCLAIMED SEVERAL VOICES CAPITAL SAID PRINCE HIPPOLYTE IN ENGLISH
404-132015-0023 THE VICOMTE MERELY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS PIERRE LOOKED SOLEMNLY AT HIS AUDIENCE OVER HIS SPECTACLES AND CONTINUED I SAY SO HE CONTINUED DESPERATELY
404-132015-0024 LEAVING THE PEOPLE TO ANARCHY AND NAPOLEON ALONE UNDERSTOOD THE REVOLUTION AND QUELLED IT AND SO FOR THE GENERAL GOOD HE COULD NOT STOP SHORT FOR THE SAKE OF ONE MAN'S LIFE WON'T YOU COME OVER TO THE OTHER TABLE
404-132015-0025 SUGGESTED ANNA PAVLOVNA BUT PIERRE CONTINUED HIS SPEECH WITHOUT HEEDING HER
404-132015-0026 NAPOLEON IS GREAT BECAUSE HE ROSE SUPERIOR TO THE REVOLUTION SUPPRESSED ITS ABUSES PRESERVED ALL THAT WAS GOOD IN IT EQUALITY OF CITIZENSHIP AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND OF THE PRESS AND ONLY FOR THAT REASON DID HE OBTAIN POWER
404-132015-0027 YES IF HAVING OBTAINED POWER WITHOUT AVAILING HIMSELF OF IT TO COMMIT MURDER HE HAD RESTORED IT TO THE RIGHTFUL KING I SHOULD HAVE CALLED HIM A GREAT MAN REMARKED THE VICOMTE HE COULD NOT DO THAT
404-132015-0028 THE PEOPLE ONLY GAVE HIM POWER THAT HE MIGHT RID THEM OF THE BOURBONS AND BECAUSE THEY SAW THAT HE WAS A GREAT MAN THE REVOLUTION WAS A GRAND THING CONTINUED MONSIEUR PIERRE BETRAYING BY THIS DESPERATE AND PROVOCATIVE PROPOSITION
404-132015-0029 HIS EXTREME YOUTH AND HIS WISH TO EXPRESS ALL THAT WAS IN HIS MIND WHAT REVOLUTION AND REGICIDE A GRAND THING WELL AFTER THAT
404-132015-0030 SAID THE VICOMTE WITH A TOLERANT SMILE
404-132015-0031 THOSE WERE EXTREMES NO DOUBT
404-132015-0032 EMANCIPATION FROM PREJUDICES AND EQUALITY OF CITIZENSHIP AND ALL THESE IDEAS NAPOLEON HAS RETAINED IN FULL FORCE LIBERTY AND EQUALITY SAID THE VICOMTE CONTEMPTUOUSLY AS IF
404-132015-0033 AT LAST DECIDING SERIOUSLY TO PROVE TO THIS YOUTH HOW FOOLISH HIS WORDS WERE
404-132015-0034 WHO DOES NOT LOVE LIBERTY AND EQUALITY EVEN OUR SAVIOUR PREACHED LIBERTY AND EQUALITY
404-132015-0035 ON THE CONTRARY WE WANTED LIBERTY BUT BUONAPARTE HAS DESTROYED IT PRINCE ANDREW KEPT LOOKING WITH AN AMUSED SMILE FROM PIERRE TO THE VICOMTE AND FROM THE VICOMTE TO THEIR HOSTESS
404-132015-0036 DESPITE HER SOCIAL EXPERIENCE WAS HORROR STRUCK BUT WHEN SHE SAW THAT PIERRE'S SACRILEGIOUS WORDS HAD NOT
404-132015-0037 AND HAD CONVINCED HERSELF THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP HIM SHE RALLIED HER FORCES AND JOINED THE VICOMTE IN A VIGOROUS ATTACK ON THE ORATOR BUT MY DEAR MONSIEUR PIERRE
404-132015-0038 OR EVEN AN ORDINARY MAN WHO IS INNOCENT AND UNTRIED I SHOULD LIKE SAID THE VICOMTE TO ASK HOW MONSIEUR EXPLAINS THE EIGHTEENTH BRUMAIRE WAS NOT THAT AN IMPOSTURE IT WAS A SWINDLE AND NOT AT ALL LIKE THE CONDUCT OF A GREAT MAN
404-132015-0039 THAT WAS HORRIBLE SAID THE LITTLE PRINCESS SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS HE'S A LOW FELLOW SAY WHAT YOU WILL REMARKED PRINCE HIPPOLYTE PIERRE NOT KNOWING WHOM TO ANSWER LOOKED AT THEM ALL AND SMILED
404-132015-0040 HIS SMILE WAS UNLIKE THE HALF SMILE OF OTHER PEOPLE WHEN HE SMILED
404-132015-0041 WAS INSTANTANEOUSLY REPLACED BY ANOTHER A CHILDLIKE KINDLY EVEN RATHER SILLY LOOK WHICH SEEMED TO ASK FORGIVENESS THE VICOMTE WHO WAS MEETING HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME
404-132015-0042 SAW CLEARLY THAT THIS YOUNG JACOBIN WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE AS HIS WORDS SUGGESTED ALL WERE SILENT HOW DO YOU EXPECT HIM TO ANSWER YOU ALL AT ONCE SAID PRINCE ANDREW BESIDES
404-132015-0043 IN THE ACTIONS OF A STATESMAN ONE HAS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HIS ACTS AS A PRIVATE PERSON AS A GENERAL AND AS AN EMPEROR SO IT SEEMS TO ME YES YES OF COURSE PIERRE CHIMED IN PLEASED AT THE ARRIVAL OF THIS REINFORCEMENT
404-132015-0044 ONE MUST ADMIT CONTINUED PRINCE ANDREW THAT NAPOLEON AS A MAN WAS GREAT ON THE BRIDGE OF ARCOLA AND IN THE HOSPITAL AT JAFFA WHERE HE GAVE HIS HAND TO THE PLAGUE STRICKEN
404-132015-0045 PRINCE ANDREW
404-132015-0046 ROSE AND MADE A SIGN TO HIS WIFE THAT IT WAS TIME TO GO SUDDENLY PRINCE HIPPOLYTE STARTED UP MAKING SIGNS TO EVERYONE TO ATTEND
404-132015-0047 AND MUST TREAT YOU TO IT EXCUSE ME VICOMTE I MUST TELL IT IN RUSSIAN OR THE POINT WILL BE LOST AND PRINCE HIPPOLYTE BEGAN TO TELL HIS STORY
404-132015-0048 EVERYONE WAITED SO EMPHATICALLY AND EAGERLY DID HE DEMAND THEIR ATTENTION TO HIS STORY THERE IS IN MOSCOW A LADY UNE DAME AND SHE IS VERY STINGY SHE MUST HAVE TWO FOOTMEN BEHIND HER CARRIAGE
404-132015-0049 AND VERY BIG ONES THAT WAS HER TASTE AND SHE HAD A LADY'S MAID ALSO BIG SHE SAID HERE PRINCE HIPPOLYTE PAUSED EVIDENTLY COLLECTING HIS IDEAS WITH DIFFICULTY SHE SAID OH YES SHE SAID GIRL TO THE MAID
404-132015-0050 PUT ON A LIVERY GET UP BEHIND THE CARRIAGE AND COME WITH ME WHILE I MAKE SOME CALLS HERE PRINCE HIPPOLYTE SPLUTTERED AND BURST OUT LAUGHING LONG BEFORE HIS AUDIENCE WHICH PRODUCED AN EFFECT UNFAVORABLE TO THE NARRATOR
404-132015-0051 SEVERAL PERSONS AMONG THEM THE ELDERLY LADY AND ANNA PAVLOVNA DID HOWEVER SMILE SHE WENT SUDDENLY THERE WAS A GREAT WIND THE GIRL LOST HER HAT AND HER LONG HAIR CAME DOWN
404-132015-0052 AND THE WHOLE WORLD KNEW AND SO THE ANECDOTE ENDED THOUGH IT WAS UNINTELLIGIBLE WHY HE HAD TOLD IT OR WHY IT HAD TO BE TOLD IN RUSSIAN STILL
404-132015-0053 ANNA PAVLOVNA AND THE OTHERS APPRECIATED PRINCE HIPPOLYTE'S SOCIAL TACT IN SO AGREEABLY ENDING PIERRE'S UNPLEASANT AND UNAMIABLE OUTBURST
