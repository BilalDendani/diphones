510-130560-0000 KARMU WAS A FARMER AND DHARMU WAS A TRADER ONCE WHEN DHARMU WAS AWAY FROM HOME KARMU GAVE A RELIGIOUS FEAST AND DID NOT INVITE DHARMU'S HOUSEHOLD WHEN DHARMU RETURNED AND LEARNT THIS
510-130560-0001 HE TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE ALSO WOULD PERFORM THE CEREMONIES IN HIS HOUSE SO THEY SET TO WORK AND WERE EMPLOYED IN COOKING RICE AND VEGETABLES FAR INTO THE NIGHT
510-130560-0002 AND KARAM GOSAIN CAME DOWN TO SEE WHAT PREPARATIONS DHARMU WAS MAKING IN HIS HONOUR AND HE WATCHED FROM THE BACK OF THE HOUSE JUST THEN DHARMU STRAINED OFF THE WATER FROM THE COOKED RICE
510-130560-0003 AND THREW IT OUT OF THE WINDOW AND IT FELL ON KARAM GOSAIN AND SCALDED HIM AND AS THE FLIES AND INSECTS WORRIED THE WOUND KARAM GOSAIN WENT OFF TO THE GANGES AND BURIED HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM
510-130560-0004 AS HE HAD THUS OFFENDED KARAM GOSAIN ALL DHARMU'S UNDERTAKINGS FAILED AND HE FELL INTO DEEP POVERTY AND HAD NOT EVEN ENOUGH TO EAT SO HE HAD TO TAKE SERVICE WITH HIS BROTHER KARMU

510-130560-0007 HE TOLD DHARMU AND HIS WIFE TO WASH THEIR HANDS AND COME AND EAT BUT THEY ANSWERED THAT THEY BELONGED TO THE HOUSEHOLD AND THAT THE HIRED LABOURERS SHOULD BE FED FIRST SO THE LABOURERS ATE AND THEY ATE UP ALL THE RICE
510-130560-0008 AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR DHARMU AND HIS WIFE WHEN THE MIDDAY MEAL WAS BROUGHT THE SAME THING HAPPENED
510-130560-0009 BUT THEY HOPED THAT IT WOULD BE MADE UP TO THEM WHEN THE WAGES WERE PAID AND WORKED ON FASTING AT EVENING WHEN THEY CAME TO PAY THE WAGES IN KIND DHARMU'S NAME WAS CALLED OUT FIRST
510-130560-0010 BUT HE TOLD HIS BROTHER TO PAY THE LABOURERS FIRST AND IN DOING THIS THE PADDY WAS ALL USED UP AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR DHARMU AND HIS WIFE SO THEY WENT HOME SORROWFULLY AND THEIR CHILDREN CRIED FOR FOOD
510-130560-0011 AND THEY HAD NOTHING TO GIVE THEM IN THE NIGHT DHARMU'S WIFE SAID THEY PROMISED TO PAY US FOR MERELY LOOKING AFTER THE WORK AND INSTEAD WE WORKED HARD AND HAVE STILL GOT NOTHING WE WILL NOT WORK FOR THEM ANYMORE
510-130560-0012 COME LET US UNDO THE WORK WE DID TO DAY YOU CUT DOWN THE EMBANKMENTS YOU REPAIRED AND I WILL UPROOT THE SEEDLINGS WHICH I PLANTED SO THEY WENT OUT INTO THE NIGHT TO DO THIS BUT WHENEVER DHARMU RAISED HIS SPADE A VOICE CALLED OUT
510-130560-0013 HOLD HOLD AND WHENEVER HIS WIFE PUT OUT HER HAND TO PULL UP THE RICE A VOICE CALLED OUT HOLD HOLD THEN THEY SAID WHO ARE YOU WHO STOP US AND THE VOICE ANSWERED

510-130560-0016 O KARAM GOSAIN HOW FAR OFF ARE YOU THEN THEY CAME TO A MANGO TREE AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED AND THEY WENT ON AND SAW A COW WITH A CALF AND THEY THOUGHT
510-130560-0017 O KARAM GOSAIN HOW FAR OFF ARE YOU BUT THE COW SAID TO THEM GO TO THE BANKS OF THE GANGES THEN THEY CAME TO A BUFFALO AND WENT TO MILK IT BUT IT LOWERED ITS HEAD AND CHARGED THEM
510-130560-0018 AND THE BUFFALO SAID GO ON TO THE BANK OF THE GANGES THEN THEY CAME TO A HORSE AND THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD CATCH IT AND MOUNT IT BUT IT KICKED AND SNORTED AND THEY SANG
510-130560-0019 AND THEY SAW UNDER A BANYAN TREE A LARGE POT FULL OF RUPEES BUT THEY WERE SO DISHEARTENED THAT THEY MADE NO ATTEMPT TO TOUCH IT THEN THEY MET A WOMAN WHO ASKED WHERE THEY WERE GOING AND WHEN SHE HEARD SHE SAID
