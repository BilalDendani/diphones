7492-87279-0000 THE PRINCESS KNEW HER ROYAL BROTHER
7492-87279-0001 LATER IN LIFE THE HIGH ROAD TO HIS FAVOR WAS IN RIDDING HIM OF HIS WIFE AND HELPING HIM TO A NEW ONE A DANGEROUS WAY THOUGH AS WOLSEY FOUND TO HIS SORROW WHEN HE SANK HIS GLORY IN POOR ANNE BOLEYN
7492-87279-0002 BRANDON TOOK THE HINT AND MANAGED TO LET IT BE KNOWN TO HIS PLAY LOVING KING THAT HE KNEW THE LATEST FRENCH GAMES
7492-87279-0003 SO BRANDON WAS TAKEN FROM HIS DUTIES SUCH AS THEY WERE AND PLACED AT THE CARD TABLE
7492-87279-0004 THAT BEING THE CASE BRANDON'S SEAT OPPOSITE THE KING WAS VERY LIKELY TO EXCITE ENVY AND THE TIME SOON CAME HENRY HAVING LEARNED THE PLAY WHEN BRANDON HAD TO FACE SOMEONE ELSE AND THE SEAT WAS TOO COSTLY FOR A MAN WITHOUT A TREASURY
7492-87279-0005 AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A BAD PLIGHT HAD NOT WOLSEY COME TO HIS RELIEF
7492-87279-0006 THIS GREAT GAME OF HONOR AND RUFF OCCUPIED HENRY'S MIND DAY AND NIGHT DURING A FORTNIGHT
7492-87279-0007 NEVER HAVING LEARNED NOT TO CLOY HIS APPETITE BY OVER FEEDING SO WE SAW LITTLE OF BRANDON WHILE THE KING'S FEVER LASTED AND MARY SAID SHE WISHED SHE HAD REMAINED SILENT ABOUT THE CARDS
7492-87279-0008 YOU SEE SHE COULD ENJOY THIS NEW PLAYTHING AS WELL AS HER BROTHER BUT THE KING OF COURSE MUST BE SATISFIED FIRST THEY BOTH HAD ENOUGH EVENTUALLY HENRY IN ONE WAY MARY IN ANOTHER
7492-87279-0009 THE NEXT MORNING AS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL A JUNE DAY AS EVER GLADDENED THE HEART OF A ROSE WE TOOK HORSE FOR WINDSOR A DELIGHTFUL SEVEN LEAGUE RIDE OVER A FAIR ROAD
7492-87279-0010 MARY AND JANE TRAVELED SIDE BY SIDE WITH AN OCCASIONAL COMPANION OR TWO AS THE ROAD PERMITTED I WAS ANGRY WITH JANE AS YOU KNOW SO DID NOT GO NEAR THE GIRLS AND BRANDON
7492-87279-0011 WITHOUT ANY APPARENT INTENTION ONE WAY OR THE OTHER ALLOWED EVENTS TO ADJUST THEMSELVES AND RODE WITH CAVENDISH AND ME WE WERE PERHAPS FORTY YARDS BEHIND THE GIRLS AND I NOTICED AFTER A TIME THAT THE LADY MARY KEPT LOOKING BACKWARD IN OUR DIRECTION AS IF FEARING RAIN FROM THE EAST
7492-87279-0012 I WAS IN HOPES THAT JANE TOO WOULD FEAR THE RAIN BUT YOU WOULD HAVE SWORN HER NECK WAS STIFF SO STRAIGHT AHEAD DID SHE KEEP HER FACE WE HAD RIDDEN PERHAPS THREE LEAGUES WHEN THE PRINCESS STOPPED HER HORSE AND TURNED IN HER SADDLE
7492-87279-0013 I HEARD HER VOICE BUT DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE SAID IN A MOMENT SOME ONE CALLED OUT MASTER BRANDON IS WANTED SO THAT GENTLEMAN RODE FORWARD AND I FOLLOWED HIM WHEN WE CAME UP WITH THE GIRLS MARY SAID
7492-87279-0014 I FEAR MY GIRTH IS LOOSE BRANDON AT ONCE DISMOUNTED TO TIGHTEN IT AND THE OTHERS OF OUR IMMEDIATE PARTY BEGAN TO CLUSTER AROUND BRANDON TRIED THE GIRTH
7492-87279-0015 HE SAID IT IS LOOSE I SAY INSISTED THE PRINCESS WITH A LITTLE IRRITATION THE SADDLE FEELS LIKE IT TRY THE OTHER
7492-87279-0016 RIDE ON WE CAN MANAGE THIS WITHOUT SO MUCH HELP
7492-87279-0017 WHILE HE WAS LOOKING FOR IT MARY LEANED OVER HER HORSE'S NECK AND ASKED WERE YOU AND CAVENDISH SETTLING ALL THE PHILOSOPHICAL POINTS NOW IN DISPUTE THAT YOU FOUND HIM SO INTERESTING NOT ALL
7492-87279-0018 YOU WERE SO ABSORBED I SUPPOSED IT COULD BE NOTHING SHORT OF THAT NO REPLIED BRANDON AGAIN BUT THE GIRTH IS NOT LOOSE PERHAPS I ONLY IMAGINED IT RETURNED MARY CARELESSLY HAVING
7492-87279-0019 LOST INTEREST IN THE GIRTH I LOOKED TOWARD JANE WHOSE EYES WERE BRIGHT WITH A SMILE AND TURNED BRANDON'S HORSE OVER TO HIM JANE'S SMILE GRADUALLY BROADENED INTO A LAUGH AND SHE SAID EDWIN I FEAR MY GIRTH IS LOOSE ALSO AS THE LADY MARY'S WAS
7492-87279-0020 THEN DROP BACK WITH ME I RESPONDED THE PRINCESS LOOKED AT US WITH A HALF SMILE HALF FROWN AND REMARKED NOW YOU DOUBTLESS CONSIDER YOURSELVES VERY BRILLIANT AND WITTY YES
7492-87279-0021 RETURNED JANE MALICIOUSLY NODDING HER HEAD IN EMPHATIC ASSENT AS THE PRINCESS AND BRANDON RODE ON BEFORE US
7492-87279-0022 SO YOU WANT ME TO RIDE WITH YOU I REPLIED YES
7492-87279-0023 I SAID NOTHING HOWEVER AND AFTER A TIME JANE SPOKE THE DANCE WAS ONE THING AND RIDING WITH YOU IS ANOTHER I DID NOT WISH TO DANCE WITH YOU BUT I DO WISH TO RIDE WITH YOU
7492-87279-0024 YOU ARE THE ONLY GENTLEMAN TO WHOM I WOULD HAVE SAID WHAT I DID ABOUT MY GIRTH BEING LOOSE AS TO THE NEW DANCE I DO NOT CARE TO LEARN IT BECAUSE I WOULD NOT DANCE IT WITH ANY MAN BUT YOU AND NOT EVEN WITH YOU YET
7492-87279-0025 IT MEANT THAT SHE CARED FOR ME AND WOULD SOME DAY BE MINE
7492-87279-0026 THIS WAS COMFORTING IF NOT SATISFYING AND LOOSENED MY TONGUE JANE YOU KNOW MY HEART IS FULL OF LOVE FOR YOU
7492-87279-0027 NOW THAT SENTENCE WAS MY ROCK AHEAD WHENEVER I TRIED TO GIVE JANE SOME IDEA OF THE STATE OF MY AFFECTIONS IT WAS A PART OF THE SPEECH WHICH I HAD PREPARED AND DELIVERED TO MARY IN JANE'S HEARING AS YOU ALREADY KNOW I HAD SAID TO THE PRINCESS
7492-87279-0028 THE UNIVERSE WILL CRUMBLE AND THE HEAVENS ROLL UP AS A SCROLL ERE MY LOVE SHALL ALTER OR PALE IT WAS A HIGH SOUNDING SENTENCE BUT IT WAS NOT TRUE AS I WAS FORCED TO ADMIT ALMOST WITH THE SAME BREATH THAT SPOKE IT
7492-87279-0029 IT IS WONDERFUL WHAT A FUND OF USELESS INFORMATION SOME PERSONS ACCUMULATE AND CLING TO WITH A PERSISTENT DETERMINATION WORTHY OF A BETTER CAUSE
7492-87279-0030 I WONDER WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HAD SHE KNOWN THAT I HAD SAID SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME THING TO A DOZEN OTHERS I NEVER SHOULD HAVE WON HER IN THAT CASE SHE DOES NOT KNOW IT YET AND NEVER SHALL IF I CAN PREVENT
7492-87279-0031 AS UPON THE MORNING OF THAT RARE RIDE TO WINDSOR AYE SURER SINCE SHE KNOWS THAT IN ALL THESE YEARS IT HAS CHANGED ONLY TO GROW GREATER AND STRONGER AND TRUER
7492-87279-0032 IN THE FRUCTIFYING LIGHT OF HER SWEET FACE AND THE NURTURING WARMTH OF HER PURE SOUL WHAT A BLESSED THING IT IS FOR A MAN TO LOVE HIS WIFE AND BE SATISFIED WITH HER
7492-87279-0033 WHO CAN STRETCH OUT THE SWEETEST SEASON OF HIS EXISTENCE
7492-87279-0034 SO JANE HALTED MY EFFORT TO POUR OUT MY HEART AS SHE ALWAYS DID THERE IS SOMETHING THAT GREATLY TROUBLES ME SHE SAID WHAT IS IT I ASKED IN SOME CONCERN
7492-87279-0035 MY MISTRESS SHE ANSWERED NODDING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TWO RIDING AHEAD OF US I NEVER SAW HER SO MUCH INTERESTED IN ANY ONE AS SHE IS IN YOUR FRIEND MASTER BRANDON
7492-87279-0036 SHE HAS NEVER BEEN COMPELLED TO FOREGO ANYTHING SHE WANTED AND HER DESIRES ARE ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE THEY DRIVE HER AND SHE IS HELPLESS AGAINST THEM SHE WOULD NOT AND COULD NOT MAKE THE SMALLEST EFFORT TO OVERCOME THEM
7492-87279-0037 I THINK IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HER THAT SUCH A THING COULD BE NECESSARY
7492-87279-0038 NOW LOOK AT THEM AHEAD OF US NO GIRL IS SO HAPPY RIDING BESIDE A MAN UNLESS SHE IS INTERESTED IN HIM SHE WAS DULL ENOUGH UNTIL HE JOINED HER
7492-87279-0039 NO I ANSWERED BUT I THINK HE IS HEART WHOLE OR NEARLY SO
7492-87279-0040 HE CERTAINLY IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MEN RETURNED JANE I THINK HE HAS NEVER SPOKEN A WORD OF LOVE TO HER HE HAS SAID SOME PRETTY THINGS WHICH SHE HAS REPEATED TO ME
7492-87279-0041 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE ANYONE ELSE TAKE THAT LIBERTY
7492-87279-0042 PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER IF HE DID IT MIGHT CURE HER I REPLIED OH NO NO NOT NOW AT FIRST PERHAPS BUT NOT NOW
7492-87279-0043 SHE MIGHT HAVE TO SPEAK FIRST OR THERE MIGHT BE NO SPEAKING FROM ONE WHO THOUGHT HIS POSITION TOO FAR BENEATH HERS SHE WHOSE SMALLEST DESIRES DRIVE HER SO WILL NEVER FOREGO SO GREAT A THING AS THE MAN SHE LOVES ONLY FOR THE WANT OF A WORD OR TWO
7492-87279-0044 THEN IT WAS THAT JANE TOLD ME OF THE SCENE WITH THE NOTE OF THE LITTLE WHISPERED CONFIDENCE UPON THEIR PILLOWS AND A HUNDRED OTHER STRAWS THAT SHOWED ONLY TOO PLAINLY WHICH WAY THIS WORST OF ILL WINDS WAS BLOWING WITH NO GOOD IN IT FOR ANY ONE
7492-87279-0045 NOW WHO COULD HAVE FORETOLD THIS
7492-87279-0046 AS ALL OTHER MEN HAD DONE BUT THAT MARY SHOULD LOVE BRANDON AND HE REMAIN HEART WHOLE WAS AN UNLOOKED FOR EVENT ONE THAT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN PREDICTED BY THE SHREWDEST PROPHET WHAT LADY JANE SAID TROUBLED ME GREATLY
7492-87279-0047 AS IT WAS BUT THE CONFIRMATION OF MY OWN FEARS HER OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW WAS FAR BETTER THAN MINE BUT I HAD SEEN ENOUGH TO SET ME THINKING BRANDON I BELIEVE SAW NOTHING OF MARY'S GROWING PARTIALITY AT ALL
7492-87279-0048 HE COULD NOT HELP BUT FIND HER WONDERFULLY ATTRACTIVE AND INTERESTING AND PERHAPS IT NEEDED ONLY THE THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT LOVE HIM TO KINDLE A FLAME IN HIS OWN BREAST BUT AT THE TIME OF OUR RIDE TO WINDSOR CHARLES BRANDON WAS NOT IN LOVE WITH MARY TUDOR
7492-87279-0049 HOWEVER NEAR IT HE MAY UNCONSCIOUSLY HAVE BEEN HE WOULD WHISTLE AND SING AND WAS AS LIGHT HEARTED AS A LARK I MEAN WHEN AWAY FROM THE PRINCESS AS WELL AS WITH HER A MOOD THAT DOES NOT GO WITH A HEART FULL OF HEAVY LOVE
7492-87279-0050 OF IMPOSSIBLE FATAL LOVE SUCH AS HIS WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR THE FIRST PRINCESS OF THE FIRST BLOOD ROYAL OF THE WORLD
7492-87279-0051 NOW AND THEN HER HEART WOULD WELL UP SO FULL OF THE SUNLIGHT AND THE FLOWERS AND THE BIRDS IN THE HEDGE AYE AND OF THE CONTAGIOUS LOVE IN MY HEART TOO THAT IT POURED ITSELF FORTH IN A SPONTANEOUS LITTLE SONG WHICH THRILLS ME EVEN NOW
7492-87279-0052 AHEAD OF US WERE THE PRINCESS AND BRANDON
7492-87279-0053 AND HER LAUGHTER RICH AND LOW WAFTED ON THE WINGS OF THE SOFT SOUTH WIND MADE THE GLAD BIRDS HUSH TO CATCH ITS SILVERY NOTE IT SEEMED THAT THE WILD FLOWERS HAD TAKEN ON THEIR BRIGHTEST HUE THE TREES THEIR RICHEST SABBATH DAY GREEN
7492-87279-0054 AND THE SUN HIS SOFTEST RADIANCE ONLY TO GLADDEN THE HEART OF MARY THAT THEY MIGHT HEAR HER LAUGH THE LAUGH WOULD HAVE COME QUITE AS JOYOUSLY HAD THE FLOWERS BEEN DEAD AND THE SUN BLACK FOR FLOWERS AND SUNLIGHT
7492-87279-0055 SOUTH WIND GREEN PASTURES AND VERDANT HILLS ALL WERE RIDING BY HER SIDE POOR MARY HER DAYS OF LAUGHTER WERE NUMBERED WE ALL RODE MERRILY ON TO WINDSOR
7492-87279-0056 AND WHEN WE ARRIVED IT WAS CURIOUS TO SEE THE GREAT NOBLES BUCKINGHAM BOTH THE HOWARDS SEYMOUR AND A DOZEN OTHERS STAND BACK FOR PLAIN CHARLES BRANDON TO DISMOUNT THE FAIREST MAIDEN AND THE MOST RENOWNED PRINCESS IN CHRISTENDOM IT WAS DONE MOST GRACEFULLY
7492-87279-0057 THE NOBLES ENVIED BRANDON HIS EVIDENT FAVOR WITH THIS UNATTAINABLE MARY AND HATED HIM ACCORDINGLY BUT THEY KEPT THEIR THOUGHTS TO THEMSELVES FOR TWO REASONS FIRST THEY KNEW NOT TO WHAT DEGREE THE KING'S FAVOR ALREADY MARKED
7492-87279-0058 DURING WHICH TIME THE KING MADE SEVERAL KNIGHTS BRANDON WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN ONE OF THEM AS EVERYBODY EXPECTED HAD NOT BUCKINGHAM RELATED TO HENRY THE EPISODE OF THE LOOSE GIRTH AND ADROITLY POISONED HIS MIND AS TO MARY'S PARTIALITY
7492-87279-0059 AT THIS THE KING BEGAN TO CAST A JEALOUS EYE ON BRANDON
7492-87279-0060 AND WHEN SHE LOVED OR MARRIED IT SHOULD BE FOR HENRY'S BENEFIT REGARDLESS OF ALL ELSE BRANDON AND THE LADY MARY SAW A GREAT DEAL OF EACH OTHER DURING THIS LITTLE STAY AT WINDSOR AS SHE ALWAYS HAD SOME PLAN TO BRING ABOUT A MEETING
7492-87279-0061 AND ALTHOUGH VERY DELIGHTFUL TO HIM IT COST HIM MUCH IN ROYAL FAVOR HE COULD NOT TRACE THIS EFFECT TO ITS PROPER CAUSE AND IT TROUBLED HIM
