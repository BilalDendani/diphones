7307-276146-0000 THE LAST BREAKFAST AND THAT DAY WAS NOT LONG IN COMING INDEED IT CAME WITH TERRIBLE ALACRITY MUCH TOO QUICKLY FOR GERTRUDE MUCH TOO QUICKLY FOR NORMAN AND MUCH TOO QUICKLY FOR ALARIC'S LAWYER
7307-276146-0001 TO ALARIC ONLY DID THE TIME PASS SLOWLY FOR HE FOUND HIMSELF UTTERLY WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT
7307-276146-0002 THE LIMEHOUSE BRIDGE WAS FOUND TO BE WORTH NOTHING THEY WERE AS THE BROKER HAD SAID TICKLISH STOCK SO TICKLISH THAT NO ONE WOULD HAVE THEM AT ANY PRICE
7307-276146-0003 WENT INTO THE MARKET ABOUT THE SAME TIME TO DISPOSE OF THEIRS THEY WERE EQUALLY UNSUCCESSFUL HOW THE AGENT LOOKED AND SPOKE AND FELT MAY BE IMAGINED FOR THE AGENT HAD MADE LARGE ADVANCES AND HAD NO OTHER SECURITY
7307-276146-0004 BUT UNDY HAD BORNE SUCH LOOKS AND SPEECHES BEFORE AND MERELY SAID THAT IT WAS VERY ODD EXTREMELY ODD HE HAD BEEN GREATLY DECEIVED BY MISTER PILES MISTER PILES ALSO SAID IT WAS VERY ODD
7307-276146-0005 AND IT WAS WHISPERED THAT QUEER AS THINGS NOW LOOKED MESSRS BLOCKS PILES AND COFFERDAM HAD NOT MADE A BAD THING OF THE BRIDGE OVERTURE AFTER OVERTURE WAS MADE TO THE LAWYER EMPLOYED BY MISSUS VAL'S PARTY
7307-276146-0006 THEN WHEN THE SHARES WERE UTTERLY REJECTED BY THE SHARE BUYING WORLD HE OFFERED TO MAKE HIMSELF PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DEBT AND TO BIND HIMSELF BY BOND TO PAY IT WITHIN SIX MONTHS
7307-276146-0007 AT FIRST THESE PROPOSITIONS WERE LISTENED TO AND ALARIC'S FRIENDS WERE LED TO BELIEVE THAT THE MATTER WOULD BE HANDLED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE PROSECUTION WOULD FALL TO THE GROUND BUT AT LAST ALL COMPOSITION WAS REFUSED
7307-276146-0008 THE ADVERSE ATTORNEY DECLARED FIRST THAT HE WAS NOT ABLE TO ACCEPT ANY MONEY PAYMENT SHORT OF THE FULL AMOUNT WITH INTEREST AND THEN HE AVERRED THAT AS CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS HAD BEEN TAKEN THEY COULD NOT NOW BE STAYED
7307-276146-0009 WHETHER OR NO ALARIC'S NIGHT ATTACK HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS WHETHER UNDY HAD BEEN THE MEANS OF INSTIGATING THIS RIGID ADHERENCE TO JUSTICE WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO SAY
7307-276146-0010 THAT DAY FOR WHICH GERTRUDE HAD PRAYED HER MOTHER'S ASSISTANCE CAME ALL TOO SOON THEY HAD BECOME AT LAST AWARE THAT THE TRIAL MUST GO ON CHARLEY WAS WITH THEM ON THE LAST EVENING AND COMPLETED THEIR DESPAIR
7307-276146-0011 BY TELLING THEM THAT THEIR ATTORNEY HAD RESOLVED TO MAKE NO FURTHER EFFORTS AT A COMPROMISE PERHAPS THE MOST PAINFUL FEELING TO GERTRUDE THROUGH THE WHOLE OF THE LAST FORTNIGHT HAD BEEN THE TOTAL PROSTRATION OF HER HUSBAND'S ENERGY
7307-276146-0012 AND ALMOST OF HIS INTELLECT HE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST THE POWER OF JUDGING FOR HIMSELF AND OF THINKING AND DECIDING WHAT CONDUCT WOULD BE BEST FOR HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION HE WHO HAD BEEN SO ENERGETIC SO FULL OF LIFE
7307-276146-0013 SO READY FOR ALL EMERGENCIES SO CLEVER AT DEVICES SO ABLE TO MANAGE NOT ONLY FOR HIMSELF BUT FOR HIS FRIENDS
7307-276146-0014 HE SAT FROM MORNING TO NIGHT LOOKING AT THE EMPTY FIRE GRATE AND HARDLY VENTURED TO SPEAK OF THE ORDEAL THAT HE HAD TO UNDERGO HIS LAWYER WAS TO CALL FOR HIM ON THE MORNING OF THE TRIAL
7307-276146-0015 AND MISSUS WOODWARD WAS TO BE AT THE HOUSE SOON AFTER HE HAD LEFT IT HE HAD NOT YET SEEN HER SINCE THE INQUIRY HAD COMMENCED AND IT WAS VERY PLAIN THAT HE DID NOT WISH TO DO SO MISSUS WOODWARD WAS TO BE THERE AND TO REMAIN TILL HIS FATE HAD BEEN DECIDED AND THEN
7307-276146-0016 BUT MISSUS WOODWARD WAS AWARE THAT HE WOULD PROBABLY BE UNABLE TO DO SO AND FELT THAT IF SUCH SHOULD BE THE CASE SHE COULD NOT LEAVE HER DAUGHTER ALONE AND SO ALARIC AND HIS WIFE SAT DOWN TO BREAKFAST ON THAT LAST MORNING
7307-276146-0017 SHE HAD BROUGHT THEIR BOY DOWN BUT AS SHE PERCEIVED THAT THE CHILD'S PRESENCE DID NOT PLEASE HIS FATHER HE HAD BEEN SENT BACK TO THE NURSERY AND THEY WERE ALONE SHE POURED OUT HIS TEA FOR HIM PUT BREAD UPON HIS PLATE
7307-276146-0018 AND THEN SAT DOWN CLOSE BESIDE HIM ENDEAVOURING TO PERSUADE HIM TO EAT SHE HAD NEVER YET FOUND FAULT WITH HIM
7307-276146-0019 BUT NOW SHE LONGED TO ENTREAT HIM TO COLLECT HIMSELF AND TAKE A MAN'S PART IN THE COMING TRIAL HE SAT IN THE SEAT PREPARED FOR HIM BUT INSTEAD OF EATING HE THRUST HIS HANDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER INTO HIS POCKETS
7307-276146-0020 AND SAT GLOWERING AT THE TEACUPS
