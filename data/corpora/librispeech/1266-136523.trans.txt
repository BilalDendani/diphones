1266-136523-0000 AGRICULTURE IS THAT WHICH IS SO UNIVERSALLY UNDERSTOOD AMONG THEM THAT NO PERSON EITHER MAN OR WOMAN IS IGNORANT OF IT THEY ARE INSTRUCTED IN IT FROM THEIR CHILDHOOD PARTLY BY WHAT THEY LEARN AT SCHOOL
1266-136523-0001 AND PARTLY BY PRACTICE THEY BEING LED OUT OFTEN INTO THE FIELDS ABOUT THE TOWN WHERE THEY NOT ONLY SEE OTHERS AT WORK BUT ARE LIKEWISE EXERCISED IN IT THEMSELVES BESIDES AGRICULTURE WHICH IS SO COMMON TO THEM ALL EVERY MAN HAS SOME PECULIAR TRADE TO WHICH HE APPLIES HIMSELF
1266-136523-0002 SUCH AS THE MANUFACTURE OF WOOL OR FLAX MASONRY SMITH'S WORK OR CARPENTER'S WORK FOR THERE IS NO SORT OF TRADE THAT IS IN GREAT ESTEEM AMONG THEM THROUGHOUT THE ISLAND THEY WEAR THE SAME SORT OF CLOTHES
1266-136523-0003 WITHOUT ANY OTHER DISTINCTION EXCEPT WHAT IS NECESSARY TO DISTINGUISH THE TWO SEXES AND THE MARRIED AND UNMARRIED THE FASHION NEVER ALTERS AND AS IT IS NEITHER DISAGREEABLE NOR UNEASY SO IT IS SUITED TO THE CLIMATE AND CALCULATED BOTH FOR THEIR SUMMERS AND WINTERS
1266-136523-0004 EVERY FAMILY MAKES THEIR OWN CLOTHES BUT ALL AMONG THEM WOMEN AS WELL AS MEN LEARN ONE OR OTHER OF THE TRADES FORMERLY MENTIONED WOMEN FOR THE MOST PART DEAL IN WOOL AND FLAX WHICH SUIT BEST WITH THEIR WEAKNESS LEAVING THE RUDER TRADES TO THE MEN
1266-136523-0005 THE SAME TRADE GENERALLY PASSES DOWN FROM FATHER TO SON INCLINATIONS OFTEN FOLLOWING DESCENT
1266-136523-0006 AND WHEN THAT IS TO BE DONE CARE IS TAKEN NOT ONLY BY HIS FATHER BUT BY THE MAGISTRATE THAT HE MAY BE PUT TO A DISCREET AND GOOD MAN AND IF AFTER A PERSON HAS LEARNED ONE TRADE HE DESIRES TO ACQUIRE ANOTHER THAT IS ALSO ALLOWED AND IS MANAGED IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE FORMER
1266-136523-0007 WHEN HE HAS LEARNED BOTH HE FOLLOWS THAT WHICH HE LIKES BEST UNLESS THE PUBLIC HAS MORE OCCASION FOR THE OTHER THE CHIEF AND ALMOST THE ONLY BUSINESS OF THE SYPHOGRANTS IS TO TAKE CARE THAT NO MAN MAY LIVE IDLE BUT THAT EVERY ONE MAY FOLLOW HIS TRADE DILIGENTLY
1266-136523-0008 YET THEY DO NOT WEAR THEMSELVES OUT WITH PERPETUAL TOIL FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AS IF THEY WERE BEASTS OF BURDEN WHICH AS IT IS INDEED A HEAVY SLAVERY SO IT IS EVERYWHERE THE COMMON COURSE OF LIFE AMONGST ALL MECHANICS EXCEPT THE UTOPIANS
1266-136523-0009 BUT THEY DIVIDING THE DAY AND NIGHT INTO TWENTY FOUR HOURS APPOINT SIX OF THESE FOR WORK THREE OF WHICH ARE BEFORE DINNER AND THREE AFTER THEY THEN SUP AND AT EIGHT O'CLOCK COUNTING FROM NOON GO TO BED AND SLEEP EIGHT HOURS
1266-136523-0010 THE REST OF THEIR TIME BESIDES THAT TAKEN UP IN WORK EATING AND SLEEPING IS LEFT TO EVERY MAN'S DISCRETION YET THEY ARE NOT TO ABUSE THAT INTERVAL TO LUXURY AND IDLENESS BUT MUST EMPLOY IT IN SOME PROPER EXERCISE ACCORDING TO THEIR VARIOUS INCLINATIONS
1266-136523-0011 WHICH IS FOR THE MOST PART READING IT IS ORDINARY TO HAVE PUBLIC LECTURES EVERY MORNING BEFORE DAYBREAK AT WHICH NONE ARE OBLIGED TO APPEAR BUT THOSE WHO ARE MARKED OUT FOR LITERATURE YET A GREAT MANY BOTH MEN AND WOMEN OF ALL RANKS GO TO HEAR LECTURES OF ONE SORT OR OTHER
1266-136523-0012 ACCORDING TO THEIR INCLINATIONS BUT IF OTHERS THAT ARE NOT MADE FOR CONTEMPLATION CHOOSE RATHER TO EMPLOY THEMSELVES AT THAT TIME IN THEIR TRADES AS MANY OF THEM DO THEY ARE NOT HINDERED BUT ARE RATHER COMMENDED AS MEN THAT TAKE CARE TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY
1266-136523-0013 AFTER SUPPER THEY SPEND AN HOUR IN SOME DIVERSION IN SUMMER IN THEIR GARDENS AND IN WINTER IN THE HALLS WHERE THEY EAT WHERE THEY ENTERTAIN EACH OTHER EITHER WITH MUSIC OR DISCOURSE THEY DO NOT SO MUCH AS KNOW DICE OR ANY SUCH FOOLISH AND MISCHIEVOUS GAMES
1266-136523-0014 THEY HAVE HOWEVER TWO SORTS OF GAMES NOT UNLIKE OUR CHESS THE ONE IS BETWEEN SEVERAL NUMBERS IN WHICH ONE NUMBER AS IT WERE CONSUMES ANOTHER THE OTHER RESEMBLES A BATTLE BETWEEN THE VIRTUES AND THE VICES IN WHICH THE ENMITY IN THE VICES AMONG THEMSELVES AND THEIR AGREEMENT AGAINST VIRTUE
1266-136523-0015 IS NOT UNPLEASANTLY REPRESENTED TOGETHER WITH THE SPECIAL OPPOSITION BETWEEN THE PARTICULAR VIRTUES AND VICES AS ALSO THE METHODS BY WHICH VICE EITHER OPENLY ASSAULTS OR SECRETLY UNDERMINES VIRTUE AND VIRTUE ON THE OTHER HAND RESISTS IT
1266-136523-0016 BUT THE TIME APPOINTED FOR LABOUR IS TO BE NARROWLY EXAMINED OTHERWISE YOU MAY IMAGINE THAT SINCE THERE ARE ONLY SIX HOURS APPOINTED FOR WORK THEY MAY FALL UNDER A SCARCITY OF NECESSARY PROVISIONS BUT IT IS SO FAR FROM BEING TRUE THAT THIS TIME IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR SUPPLYING THEM WITH PLENTY OF ALL THINGS
1266-136523-0017 EITHER NECESSARY OR CONVENIENT THAT IT IS RATHER TOO MUCH AND THIS YOU WILL EASILY APPREHEND IF YOU CONSIDER HOW GREAT A PART OF ALL OTHER NATIONS IS QUITE IDLE FIRST WOMEN GENERALLY DO LITTLE WHO ARE THE HALF OF MANKIND AND IF SOME FEW WOMEN ARE DILIGENT THEIR HUSBANDS ARE IDLE
1266-136523-0018 AND OF THOSE THAT ARE CALLED RELIGIOUS MEN ADD TO THESE ALL RICH MEN CHIEFLY THOSE THAT HAVE ESTATES IN LAND WHO ARE CALLED NOBLEMEN AND GENTLEMEN TOGETHER WITH THEIR FAMILIES MADE UP OF IDLE PERSONS THAT ARE KEPT MORE FOR SHOW THAN USE
1266-136523-0019 ADD TO THESE ALL THOSE STRONG AND LUSTY BEGGARS THAT GO ABOUT PRETENDING SOME DISEASE IN EXCUSE FOR THEIR BEGGING AND UPON THE WHOLE ACCOUNT YOU WILL FIND THAT THE NUMBER OF THOSE BY WHOSE LABOURS MANKIND IS SUPPLIED IS MUCH LESS THAN YOU PERHAPS IMAGINED
1266-136523-0020 THEN CONSIDER HOW FEW OF THOSE THAT WORK ARE EMPLOYED IN LABOURS THAT ARE OF REAL SERVICE FOR WE WHO MEASURE ALL THINGS BY MONEY GIVE RISE TO MANY TRADES THAT ARE BOTH VAIN AND SUPERFLUOUS AND SERVE ONLY TO SUPPORT RIOT AND LUXURY
1266-136523-0021 FOR IF THOSE WHO WORK WERE EMPLOYED ONLY IN SUCH THINGS AS THE CONVENIENCES OF LIFE REQUIRE THERE WOULD BE SUCH AN ABUNDANCE OF THEM THAT THE PRICES OF THEM WOULD SO SINK THAT TRADESMEN COULD NOT BE MAINTAINED BY THEIR GAINS
1266-136523-0022 IF ALL THOSE WHO LABOUR ABOUT USELESS THINGS WERE SET TO MORE PROFITABLE EMPLOYMENTS AND IF ALL THEY THAT LANGUISH OUT THEIR LIVES IN SLOTH AND IDLENESS EVERY ONE OF WHOM CONSUMES AS MUCH AS ANY TWO OF THE MEN THAT ARE AT WORK WERE FORCED TO LABOUR
1266-136523-0023 FOR DOING ALL THAT IS EITHER NECESSARY PROFITABLE OR PLEASANT TO MANKIND ESPECIALLY WHILE PLEASURE IS KEPT WITHIN ITS DUE BOUNDS THIS APPEARS VERY PLAINLY IN UTOPIA FOR THERE IN A GREAT CITY AND IN ALL THE TERRITORY THAT LIES ROUND IT
1266-136523-0024 YOU CAN SCARCE FIND FIVE HUNDRED EITHER MEN OR WOMEN BY THEIR AGE AND STRENGTH CAPABLE OF LABOUR THAT ARE NOT ENGAGED IN IT EVEN THE SYPHOGRANTS THOUGH EXCUSED BY THE LAW YET DO NOT EXCUSE THEMSELVES
1266-136523-0025 BUT WORK THAT BY THEIR EXAMPLES THEY MAY EXCITE THE INDUSTRY OF THE REST OF THE PEOPLE THE LIKE EXEMPTION IS ALLOWED TO THOSE WHO BEING RECOMMENDED TO THE PEOPLE BY THE PRIESTS ARE BY THE SECRET SUFFRAGES OF THE SYPHOGRANTS PRIVILEGED FROM LABOUR
1266-136523-0026 THAT THEY MAY APPLY THEMSELVES WHOLLY TO STUDY AND IF ANY OF THESE FALL SHORT OF THOSE HOPES THAT THEY SEEMED AT FIRST TO GIVE THEY ARE OBLIGED TO RETURN TO WORK
1266-136523-0027 OUT OF THESE THEY CHOOSE THEIR AMBASSADORS THEIR PRIESTS THEIR TRANIBORS AND THE PRINCE HIMSELF ANCIENTLY CALLED THEIR BARZENES BUT IS CALLED OF LATE THEIR ADEMUS
1266-136523-0028 AND THUS FROM THE GREAT NUMBERS AMONG THEM THAT ARE NEITHER SUFFERED TO BE IDLE NOR TO BE EMPLOYED IN ANY FRUITLESS LABOUR YOU MAY EASILY MAKE THE ESTIMATE HOW MUCH MAY BE DONE IN THOSE FEW HOURS IN WHICH THEY ARE OBLIGED TO LABOUR
1266-136523-0029 IT IS TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THE NEEDFUL ARTS AMONG THEM ARE MANAGED WITH LESS LABOUR THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
1266-136523-0030 BECAUSE OFTEN A THRIFTLESS HEIR SUFFERS A HOUSE THAT HIS FATHER BUILT TO FALL INTO DECAY SO THAT HIS SUCCESSOR MUST AT A GREAT COST REPAIR THAT WHICH HE MIGHT HAVE KEPT UP WITH A SMALL CHARGE IT FREQUENTLY HAPPENS THAT THE SAME HOUSE WHICH ONE PERSON BUILT AT A VAST EXPENSE
1266-136523-0031 IS NEGLECTED BY ANOTHER WHO THINKS HE HAS A MORE DELICATE SENSE OF THE BEAUTIES OF ARCHITECTURE AND HE SUFFERING IT TO FALL TO RUIN BUILDS ANOTHER AT NO LESS CHARGE BUT AMONG THE UTOPIANS ALL THINGS ARE SO REGULATED THAT MEN VERY SELDOM BUILD UPON A NEW PIECE OF GROUND
1266-136523-0032 AND ARE NOT ONLY VERY QUICK IN REPAIRING THEIR HOUSES BUT SHOW THEIR FORESIGHT IN PREVENTING THEIR DECAY
1266-136523-0033 AND THUS THE BUILDERS TO WHOM THAT CARE BELONGS ARE OFTEN WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT EXCEPT THE HEWING OF TIMBER AND THE SQUARING OF STONES THAT THE MATERIALS MAY BE IN READINESS FOR RAISING A BUILDING VERY SUDDENLY WHEN THERE IS ANY OCCASION FOR IT
1266-136523-0034 AS TO THEIR CLOTHES OBSERVE HOW LITTLE WORK IS SPENT IN THEM WHILE THEY ARE AT LABOUR THEY ARE CLOTHED WITH LEATHER AND SKINS CUT CARELESSLY ABOUT THEM WHICH WILL LAST SEVEN YEARS AND WHEN THEY APPEAR IN PUBLIC THEY PUT ON AN UPPER GARMENT WHICH HIDES THE OTHER
1266-136523-0035 AS THEY NEED LESS WOOLLEN CLOTH THAN IS USED ANYWHERE ELSE SO THAT WHICH THEY MAKE USE OF IS MUCH LESS COSTLY THEY USE LINEN CLOTH MORE BUT THAT IS PREPARED WITH LESS LABOUR AND THEY VALUE CLOTH ONLY BY THE WHITENESS OF THE LINEN OR THE CLEANNESS OF THE WOOL
1266-136523-0036 WITHOUT MUCH REGARD TO THE FINENESS OF THE THREAD
1266-136523-0037 AND AS MANY VESTS OF SILK WILL SCARCE SERVE ONE MAN AND WHILE THOSE THAT ARE NICER THINK TEN TOO FEW EVERY MAN THERE IS CONTENT WITH ONE WHICH VERY OFTEN SERVES HIM TWO YEARS NOR IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN TEMPT A MAN TO DESIRE MORE
1266-136523-0038 FOR IF HE HAD THEM HE WOULD NEITHER BE THE WARMER NOR WOULD HE MAKE ONE JOT THE BETTER APPEARANCE FOR IT AND THUS SINCE THEY ARE ALL EMPLOYED IN SOME USEFUL LABOUR AND SINCE THEY CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH FEWER THINGS IT FALLS OUT THAT THERE IS A GREAT ABUNDANCE OF ALL THINGS AMONG THEM
1266-136523-0039 SO THAT IT FREQUENTLY HAPPENS THAT FOR WANT OF OTHER WORK VAST NUMBERS ARE SENT OUT TO MEND THE HIGHWAYS BUT WHEN NO PUBLIC UNDERTAKING IS TO BE PERFORMED THE HOURS OF WORKING ARE LESSENED
