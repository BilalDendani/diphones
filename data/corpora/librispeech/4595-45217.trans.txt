4595-45217-0005 I HAVE A LETTER FROM MISTER PICKERING MYSELF THIS MORNING JUST A MOMENT SIR HE PLACED BEFORE ME A NOTE BEARING THE SAME DATE AS MY OWN IT WAS A SHARP REBUKE OF BATES FOR HIS FAILURE TO REPORT MY ABSENCE AND HE WAS ORDERED TO PREPARE TO LEAVE ON THE FIRST OF FEBRUARY
4595-45217-0006 HE WAS CARRYING AWAY THE COFFEE TRAY AND HIS EYES WANDERED TO THE WINDOWS NOT QUITE SIR YOU SEE BUT I DONT SEE IT HAD OCCURRED TO ME THAT AS MISTER PICKERINGS ALLOWANCE WASNT WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL GENEROUS

4595-45217-0008 YOUR GRANDFATHER WOULD NOT HAVE HAD YOU STARVE SIR HE LEFT HURRIEDLY AS THOUGH TO ESCAPE FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS WORDS AND WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF LARRY WAS GLOOMILY INVOKING HIS STRANGE IRISH GODS
4595-45217-0009 LARRY DONOVAN IVE BEEN TEMPTED TO KILL THAT FELLOW A DOZEN TIMES THIS THING IS TOO DAMNED COMPLICATED FOR ME I WISH MY LAMENTED GRANDFATHER HAD LEFT ME SOMETHING EASY TO THINK OF ITTHAT FELLOW AFTER MY TREATMENT OF HIMMY

4595-45217-0012 BAH THESE WOMEN AND NOW WEVE GOT TO GO TO WORK BAH THESE WOMEN MY OWN HEART CAUGHT THE WORDS I WAS ENRAGED AND BITTER
4595-45217-0013 OF COURSE SAID THE BROAD SHOULDERED CHAPLAIN IF YOU COULD SHOW THAT YOUR ABSENCE WAS ON BUSINESS OF VERY GRAVE IMPORTANCE THE COURTS MIGHT CONSTRUE IN THAT YOU HAD NOT REALLY VIOLATED THE WILL LARRY LOOKED AT THE CEILING AND BLEW RINGS OF SMOKE LANGUIDLY
4595-45217-0014 I HAD NOT DISCLOSED TO EITHER OF THEM THE CAUSE OF MY ABSENCE ON SUCH A MATTER I KNEW I SHOULD GET PRECIOUS LITTLE SYMPATHY FROM LARRY AND I HAD MOREOVER A FEELING THAT I COULD NOT DISCUSS MARIAN DEVEREUX WITH ANY ONE
4595-45217-0015 I EVEN SHRANK FROM MENTIONING HER NAME THOUGH IT RANG LIKE THE CALL OF BUGLES IN MY BLOOD SHE WAS ALWAYS BEFORE ME THE CHARMED SPIRIT OF YOUTH LINKED TO EVERY FOOT OF THE EARTH EVERY GLEAM OF THE SUN UPON THE ICE BOUND LAKE EVERY GLORY OF THE WINTER SUNSET
4595-45217-0016 ALL THE GOOD IMPULSES I HAD EVER STIFLED WERE QUICKENED TO LIFE BY THE THOUGHT OF HER AMID THE DAYS PERPLEXITIES I STARTED SOMETIMES THINKING I HEARD HER VOICE HER GIRLISH LAUGHTER OR SAW HER AGAIN COMING TOWARD ME DOWN THE STAIRS OR HOLDING AGAINST THE LIGHT
4595-45217-0017 HER FAN WITH ITS GOLDEN BUTTERFLIES I REALLY KNEW SO LITTLE OF HER I COULD ASSOCIATE HER WITH NO HOME ONLY WITH THAT LAST FLING OF THE AUTUMN UPON THE LAKE THE SNOW DRIVEN WOODLAND THAT TWILIGHT HOUR AT THE ORGAN IN THE CHAPEL THOSE STOLEN MOMENTS AT THE ARMSTRONGS
4595-45217-0018 I RESENTED THE PRESSURE OF THE HOURS AFFAIRS AND CHAFED AT THE NECESSITY FOR TALKING OF MY PERPLEXITIES WITH THE GOOD FRIENDS WHO WERE THERE TO HELP I WISHED TO BE ALONE TO YIELD TO THE SWEET MOOD THAT THE THOUGHT OF HER BROUGHT ME
4595-45217-0019 THE DOUBT THAT CREPT THROUGH MY MIND AS TO ANY POSSIBILITY OF CONNIVANCE BETWEEN HER AND PICKERING WAS AS VAGUE AND FLEETING AS THE SHADOW OF A SWALLOWS WING ON A SUNNY MEADOW YOU DONT INTEND FIGHTING THE FACT OF YOUR ABSENCE DO YOU DEMANDED LARRY AFTER A LONG SILENCE
4595-45217-0020 OF COURSE NOT I REPLIED QUIETLY PICKERING WAS RIGHT ON MY HEELS AND MY ABSENCE WAS KNOWN TO HIS MEN HERE AND IT WOULD NOT BE SQUARE TO MY GRANDFATHER WHO NEVER HARMED A FLEA MAY HIS SOUL REST IN BLESSED PEACE TO LIE ABOUT IT THEY MIGHT NAIL ME FOR PERJURY BESIDES
4595-45217-0021 AND AS YOU DONT TRUST THE EXECUTOR ANY FURTHER THAN A TRUE IRISHMAN TRUSTS A BRITISH PRIME MINISTERS PROMISE
4595-45217-0022 THATS AS NEAR ONE OF MY IDEAS AS YOURE LIKELY TO GET LARRY DONOVAN AND IF HE COMES WITH THE AUTHORITIES THE SHERIFF AND THAT SORT OF THING WE MUST PREPARE FOR SUCH AN EMERGENCY INTERPOSED THE CHAPLAIN SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR THE SHERIFF AND THE REST OF THEM
4595-45217-0023 IVE TRIED BEING HUNGRY AND I DONT CARE TO REPEAT THE EXPERIENCE AND LARRY REACHED FOR THE TOBACCO JAR I CANT IMAGINE I REALLY CANT BELIEVE BEGAN THE CHAPLAIN
4595-45217-0024 I SUPPOSE THERES NO WAY OF PREVENTING A MAN FROM LEAVING HIS PROPERTY TO A YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAS NO CLAIM ON HIM WHO DOESNT WANT ANYTHING FROM HIM
4595-45217-0025 THEN HIS EYES WIDENED AND MET MINE IN A GAZE THAT REFLECTED THE MYSTIFICATION AND WONDER THAT STRUCK BOTH OF US STODDARD TURNED FROM THE FIRE SUDDENLY WHATS THAT THERES SOME ONE UP STAIRS
4595-45217-0026 LARRY WAS ALREADY RUNNING TOWARD THE HALL AND I HEARD HIM SPRINGING UP THE STEPS LIKE A CAT WHILE STODDARD AND I FOLLOWED WHERES BATES DEMANDED THE CHAPLAIN
4595-45217-0027 WE COULD HEAR QUITE DISTINCTLY SOME ONE WALKING ON A STAIRWAY THE SOUNDS WERE UNMISTAKABLE JUST AS I HAD HEARD THEM ON SEVERAL PREVIOUS OCCASIONS WITHOUT EVER BEING ABLE TO TRACE THEIR SOURCE THE NOISE CEASED SUDDENLY LEAVING US WITH NO HINT OF ITS WHEREABOUTS
4595-45217-0028 I WENT DIRECTLY TO THE REAR OF THE HOUSE AND FOUND BATES PUTTING THE DISHES AWAY IN THE PANTRY WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN I DEMANDED
4595-45217-0029 IS THERE ANYTHING THE MATTER SIR NOTHING I JOINED THE OTHERS IN THE LIBRARY WHY DIDNT YOU TELL ME THIS FEUDAL IMITATION WAS HAUNTED ASKED LARRY IN A GRIEVED TONE
4595-45217-0030 HOW OFTEN DOES IT WALK ITS NOT ON A SCHEDULE JUST NOW ITS THE WIND IN THE TOWER PROBABLY THE WIND PLAYS QUEER PRANKS UP THERE SOMETIMES YOULL HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THAT GLENARM SAID STODDARD ITS AS STILL OUTSIDE AS A COUNTRY GRAVEYARD
4595-45217-0031 THE PEOPLE OF THE FAERY HILLS THE CHEERFULEST GHOSTS IN THE WORLD SAID LARRY YOU LITERAL SAXONS CANT GRASP THE IDEA OF COURSE BUT THERE WAS SUBSTANCE ENOUGH IN OUR DANGERS WITHOUT PURSUING SHADOWS CERTAIN THINGS WERE PLANNED THAT NIGHT
4595-45217-0032 WE DETERMINED TO EXERCISE EVERY PRECAUTION TO PREVENT A SURPRISE FROM WITHOUT AND WE RESOLVED UPON A NEW AND SYSTEMATIC SOUNDING OF WALLS AND FLOORS TAKING OUR CLUE FROM THE EFFORTS MADE BY MORGAN AND HIS ALLY TO FIND HIDING PLACES BY THIS PROCESS PICKERING WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY ARRIVE SHORTLY
4595-45217-0033 AND WE WISHED TO ANTICIPATE HIS MOVEMENTS AS FAR AS POSSIBLE WE RESOLVED TOO UPON A DAY PATROL OF THE GROUNDS AND A NIGHT GUARD THE SUGGESTION CAME I BELIEVE FROM STODDARD WHOSE INTEREST IN MY AFFAIRS WAS ONLY EQUALED BY THE FERTILITY OF HIS SUGGESTIONS
4595-45217-0034 ONE OF US SHOULD REMAIN ABROAD AT NIGHT READY TO SOUND THE ALARM IN CASE OF ATTACK BATES SHOULD TAKE HIS TURN WITH THE REST STODDARD INSISTED ON IT WITHIN TWO DAYS WE WERE AS LARRY EXPRESSED IT ON A WAR FOOTING WE ADDED A COUPLE OF SHOT GUNS AND SEVERAL REVOLVERS TO MY OWN ARSENAL
4595-45217-0035 AND PILED THE LIBRARY TABLE WITH CARTRIDGE BOXES BATES ACTING AS QUARTER MASTER BROUGHT A COUPLE OF WAGON LOADS OF PROVISIONS STODDARD ASSEMBLED A REMARKABLE COLLECTION OF HEAVY STICKS HE HAD MORE CONFIDENCE IN THEM HE SAID THAN IN GUNPOWDER
4595-45217-0036 IT WAS A CHEERFUL COMPANY OF CONSPIRATORS THAT NOW GATHERED AROUND THE BIG HEARTH LARRY ALWAYS RESTLESS PREFERRED TO STAND AT ONE SIDE AN ELBOW ON THE MANTEL SHELF PIPE IN MOUTH AND STODDARD SOUGHT THE BIGGEST CHAIR AND FILLED IT
4595-45217-0037 HE AND LARRY UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER AT ONCE AND LARRYS STORIES RANGING IN SUBJECT FROM UNDERGRADUATE EXPERIENCES AT DUBLIN TO ADVENTURES IN AFRICA AND ALWAYS INCLUDING ENDLESS CONFLICTS WITH THE IRISH CONSTABULARY DELIGHTED THE BIG BOYISH CLERGYMAN
