1316-132800-0000 IT WAS NOT OVER ENGLAND ALONE THAT WILLIAM'S GUARDIANSHIP NOW EXTENDED SCOTLAND HAD RISEN ON HER TYRANTS ALL THE REGULAR SOLDIERS BY WHOM SHE HAD LONG BEEN HELD DOWN HAD BEEN SUMMONED BY JAMES TO HIS HELP AGAINST THE DUTCH INVADERS
1316-132800-0001 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A VERY SMALL FORCE WHICH UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE DUKE OF GORDON A GREAT ROMAN CATHOLIC LORD GARRISONED THE CASTLE OF EDINBURGH EVERY MAIL WHICH HAD GONE NORTHWARD DURING THE EVENTFUL MONTH OF NOVEMBER
1316-132800-0002 HAD CARRIED NEWS WHICH STIRRED THE PASSIONS OF THE OPPRESSED SCOTS WHILE THE EVENT OF THE MILITARY OPERATIONS WAS STILL DOUBTFUL THERE WERE AT EDINBURGH RIOTS AND CLAMOURS WHICH BECAME MORE MENACING AFTER JAMES HAD RETREATED FROM SALISBURY
1316-132800-0003 GREAT CROWDS ASSEMBLED AT FIRST BY NIGHT AND THEN BY BROAD DAYLIGHT POPES WERE PUBLICLY BURNED LOUD SHOUTS WERE RAISED FOR A FREE PARLIAMENT PLACARDS WERE STUCK UP SETTING PRICES ON THE HEADS OF THE MINISTERS OF THE CROWN
1316-132800-0004 AMONG THOSE MINISTERS PERTH AS FILLING THE GREAT PLACE OF CHANCELLOR AS STANDING HIGH IN THE ROYAL FAVOUR AS AN APOSTATE FROM THE REFORMED FAITH AND AS THE MAN WHO HAD FIRST INTRODUCED THE THUMBSCREW INTO THE JURISPRUDENCE OF HIS COUNTRY
1316-132800-0005 WAS THE MOST DETESTED HIS NERVES WERE WEAK HIS SPIRIT ABJECT AND THE ONLY COURAGE WHICH HE POSSESSED WAS THAT EVIL COURAGE WHICH BRAVES INFAMY AND WHICH LOOKS STEADILY ON THE TORMENTS OF OTHERS
1316-132800-0006 HIS POST AT SUCH A TIME WAS AT THE HEAD OF THE COUNCIL BOARD BUT HIS HEART FAILED HIM AND HE DETERMINED TO TAKE REFUGE AT HIS COUNTRY SEAT FROM THE DANGER WHICH AS HE JUDGED BY THE LOOKS AND CRIES OF THE FIERCE AND RESOLUTE POPULACE OF EDINBURGH WAS NOT REMOTE
1316-132800-0007 A STRONG GUARD ESCORTED HIM SAFE TO CASTLE DRUMMOND BUT SCARCELY HAD HE DEPARTED WHEN THE CITY ROSE UP A FEW TROOPS TRIED TO SUPPRESS THE INSURRECTION BUT WERE OVERPOWERED THE PALACE OF HOLYROOD WHICH HAD BEEN TURNED INTO A ROMAN CATHOLIC SEMINARY AND PRINTING HOUSE
1316-132800-0008 WAS STORMED AND SACKED HUGE HEAPS OF POPISH BOOKS BEADS CRUCIFIXES AND PICTURES WERE BURNED IN THE HIGH STREET IN THE MIDST OF THE AGITATION CAME DOWN THE TIDINGS OF THE KING'S FLIGHT THE MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT GAVE UP ALL THOUGHT OF CONTENDING WITH THE POPULAR FURY
1316-132800-0009 AND CHANGED SIDES WITH A PROMPTITUDE THEN COMMON AMONG SCOTTISH POLITICIANS THE PRIVY COUNCIL BY ONE PROCLAMATION ORDERED THAT ALL PAPISTS SHOULD BE DISARMED AND BY ANOTHER INVITED PROTESTANTS TO MUSTER FOR THE DEFENCE OF PURE RELIGION
1316-132800-0010 THE NATION HAD NOT WAITED FOR THE CALL TOWN AND COUNTRY WERE ALREADY UP IN ARMS FOR THE PRINCE OF ORANGE NITHISDALE AND CLYDESDALE WERE THE ONLY REGIONS IN WHICH THERE WAS THE LEAST CHANCE THAT THE ROMAN CATHOLICS WOULD MAKE HEAD
1316-132800-0011 AND BOTH NITHISDALE AND CLYDESDALE WERE SOON OCCUPIED BY BANDS OF ARMED PRESBYTERIANS AMONG THE INSURGENTS WERE SOME FIERCE AND MOODY MEN WHO HAD FORMERLY DISOWNED ARGYLE AND WHO WERE NOW EQUALLY EAGER TO DISOWN WILLIAM
1316-132800-0012 HIS HIGHNESS THEY SAID WAS PLAINLY A MALIGNANT THERE WAS NOT A WORD ABOUT THE COVENANT IN HIS DECLARATION THE DUTCH WERE A PEOPLE WITH WHOM NO TRUE SERVANT OF THE LORD WOULD UNITE THEY CONSORTED WITH LUTHERANS
1316-132800-0013 HE WILDLY TRIED TO FIND CONSOLATION IN THE RITES OF HIS NEW CHURCH HE IMPORTUNED HIS PRIESTS FOR COMFORT PRAYED CONFESSED AND COMMUNICATED BUT HIS FAITH WAS WEAK AND HE OWNED THAT IN SPITE OF ALL HIS DEVOTIONS
1316-132800-0014 THE STRONG TERRORS OF DEATH WERE UPON HIM AT THIS TIME
1316-132800-0015 HE DISGUISED HIMSELF AS WELL AS HE COULD
1316-132800-0016 HE SUCCEEDED IN EMBARKING BUT IN SPITE OF ALL HIS PRECAUTIONS HE HAD BEEN RECOGNISED AND THE ALARM HAD BEEN GIVEN AS SOON AS IT WAS KNOWN THAT THE CRUEL RENEGADE WAS ON THE WATERS AND THAT HE HAD GOLD WITH HIM PURSUERS INFLAMED AT ONCE BY HATRED AND BY AVARICE WERE ON HIS TRACK
1316-132800-0017 A SKIFF COMMANDED BY AN OLD BUCCANEER OVERTOOK THE FLYING VESSEL AND BOARDED HER PERTH WAS DRAGGED OUT OF THE HOLD ON DECK IN WOMAN'S CLOTHES STRIPPED HUSTLED AND PLUNDERED BAYONETS WERE HELD TO HIS BREAST BEGGING FOR LIFE WITH UNMANLY CRIES
1316-132800-0018 THENCE BY ORDER OF THE COUNCIL OVER WHICH HE HAD LATELY PRESIDED AND WHICH WAS FILLED WITH MEN WHO HAD BEEN PARTAKERS IN HIS GUILT HE WAS REMOVED TO STIRLING CASTLE IT WAS ON A SUNDAY DURING THE TIME OF PUBLIC WORSHIP THAT HE WAS CONVEYED UNDER A GUARD TO HIS PLACE OF CONFINEMENT
1316-132800-0019 BUT EVEN RIGID PURITANS FORGOT THE SANCTITY OF THE DAY AND OF THE WORK THE CHURCHES POURED FORTH THEIR CONGREGATIONS AS THE TORTURER PASSED BY AND THE NOISE OF THREATS EXECRATIONS AND SCREAMS OF HATRED
1316-132800-0020 AND MANY OTHERS NOW HASTENED THITHER TO PAY THEIR COURT TO HIM ON THE SEVENTH OF JANUARY HE REQUESTED THEM TO ATTEND HIM AT WHITEHALL THE ASSEMBLAGE WAS LARGE AND RESPECTABLE THE DUKE OF HAMILTON AND HIS ELDEST SON THE EARL OF ARRAN
1316-132800-0021 THE CHIEFS OF A HOUSE OF ALMOST REGAL DIGNITY APPEARED AT THE HEAD OF THE PROCESSION THEY WERE ACCOMPANIED BY THIRTY LORDS AND ABOUT EIGHTY GENTLEMEN OF NOTE WILLIAM DESIRED THEM TO CONSULT TOGETHER
1316-132800-0022 AND TO LET HIM KNOW IN WHAT WAY HE COULD BEST PROMOTE THE WELFARE OF THEIR COUNTRY HE THEN WITHDREW AND LEFT THEM TO DELIBERATE UNRESTRAINED BY HIS PRESENCE THEY REPAIRED TO THE COUNCIL CHAMBER AND PUT HAMILTON INTO THE CHAIR
1316-132800-0023 THOUGH THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN LITTLE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THEIR DEBATES LASTED THREE DAYS A FACT WHICH IS SUFFICIENTLY EXPLAINED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT SIR PATRICK HUME WAS ONE OF THE DEBATERS ARRAN VENTURED TO RECOMMEND A NEGOTIATION WITH THE KING
1316-132800-0024 BUT THIS MOTION WAS ILL RECEIVED BY THE MOVER'S FATHER AND BY THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY AND DID NOT EVEN FIND A SECONDER AT LENGTH RESOLUTIONS WERE CARRIED CLOSELY RESEMBLING THE RESOLUTIONS WHICH THE ENGLISH LORDS AND COMMONERS HAD PRESENTED TO THE PRINCE A FEW DAYS BEFORE
1316-132800-0025 THERE WAS A VERY SMALL FACTION WHICH WISHED TO RECALL JAMES WITHOUT STIPULATIONS THERE WAS ALSO A VERY SMALL FACTION WHICH WISHED TO SET UP A COMMONWEALTH AND TO ENTRUST THE ADMINISTRATION TO A COUNCIL OF STATE UNDER THE PRESIDENCY OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE
1316-132800-0026 CONSISTED OF PERSONS IN WHOM LOVE OF HEREDITARY MONARCHY AND LOVE OF CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOM WERE COMBINED THOUGH IN DIFFERENT PROPORTIONS AND WHO WERE EQUALLY OPPOSED TO THE TOTAL ABOLITION OF THE KINGLY OFFICE AND TO THE UNCONDITIONAL RESTORATION OF THE KING
1316-132800-0027 BUT IN THE WIDE INTERVAL WHICH SEPARATED THE BIGOTS WHO STILL CLUNG TO THE DOCTRINES OF FILMER FROM THE ENTHUSIASTS WHO STILL DREAMED THE DREAMS OF HARRINGTON THERE WAS ROOM FOR MANY SHADES OF OPINION
1316-132800-0028 IF WE NEGLECT MINUTE SUBDIVISIONS WE SHALL FIND THAT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE NATION AND OF THE CONVENTION WAS DIVIDED INTO FOUR BODIES THREE OF THESE BODIES CONSISTED OF TORIES THE WHIG PARTY FORMED THE FOURTH
1316-132800-0029 THE AMITY OF THE WHIGS AND TORIES HAD NOT SURVIVED THE PERIL WHICH HAD PRODUCED IT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS DURING THE PRINCE'S MARCH FROM THE WEST DISSENSION HAD APPEARED AMONG HIS FOLLOWERS
1316-132800-0030 THAT DISSENSION HAD BY HIS SKILFUL MANAGEMENT BEEN EASILY QUIETED BUT FROM THE DAY ON WHICH HE ENTERED SAINT JAMES'S PALACE IN TRIUMPH SUCH MANAGEMENT COULD NO LONGER BE PRACTISED HIS VICTORY
1316-132800-0031 BY RELIEVING THE NATION FROM THE STRONG DREAD OF POPISH TYRANNY HAD DEPRIVED HIM OF HALF HIS INFLUENCE OLD ANTIPATHIES WHICH HAD SLEPT WHEN BISHOPS WERE IN THE TOWER WHEN JESUITS WERE AT THE COUNCIL BOARD
1316-132800-0032 WITH ALL THAT FROM HIS YOUTH UP HE HAD MOST HATED WITH OLD PARLIAMENTARY CAPTAINS WHO HAD STORMED HIS COUNTRY HOUSE WITH OLD PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONERS WHO HAD SEQUESTRATED HIS ESTATE WITH MEN WHO HAD PLOTTED THE RYE HOUSE BUTCHERY AND HEADED THE WESTERN REBELLION
1316-132800-0033 THAT BELOVED CHURCH TOO FOR WHOSE SAKE HE HAD AFTER A PAINFUL STRUGGLE BROKEN THROUGH HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE THRONE WAS SHE REALLY IN SAFETY OR HAD HE RESCUED HER FROM ONE ENEMY ONLY THAT SHE MIGHT BE EXPOSED TO ANOTHER
1316-132800-0034 THE POPISH PRIESTS INDEED WERE IN EXILE IN HIDING OR IN PRISON
1316-132800-0035 BUT THE PRESBYTERIAN AND INDEPENDENT TEACHERS WENT IN LONG PROCESSION TO SALUTE THE CHIEF OF THE GOVERNMENT AND WERE AS GRACIOUSLY RECEIVED AS THE TRUE SUCCESSORS OF THE APOSTLES SOME SCHISMATICS AVOWED THE HOPE
1316-132800-0036 THAT EVERY FENCE WHICH EXCLUDED THEM FROM ECCLESIASTICAL PREFERMENT WOULD SOON BE LEVELLED THAT THE ARTICLES WOULD BE SOFTENED DOWN THAT THE LITURGY WOULD BE GARBLED THAT CHRISTMAS WOULD CEASE TO BE A FEAST THAT GOOD FRIDAY WOULD CEASE TO BE A FAST
1316-132800-0037 THAT CANONS ON WHOM NO BISHOP HAD EVER LAID HIS HAND WOULD WITHOUT THE SACRED VESTMENT OF WHITE LINEN DISTRIBUTE IN THE CHOIRS OF CATHEDRALS THE EUCHARISTIC BREAD AND WINE TO COMMUNICANTS LOLLING ON BENCHES THE PRINCE INDEED
1316-132800-0038 WAS NOT A FANATICAL PRESBYTERIAN BUT HE WAS AT BEST A LATITUDINARIAN HE HAD NO SCRUPLE ABOUT COMMUNICATING IN THE ANGLICAN FORM BUT HE CARED NOT IN WHAT FORM OTHER PEOPLE COMMUNICATED HIS WIFE IT WAS TO BE FEARED HAD IMBIBED TOO MUCH OF HIS SPIRIT
1316-132800-0039 AND SHOULD IN SPITE OF ALL THE FAULTS OF THE HEREDITARY MONARCH UPHOLD THE CAUSE OF HEREDITARY MONARCHY THE BODY WHICH WAS ANIMATED BY THESE SENTIMENTS WAS LARGE AND RESPECTABLE
1316-132800-0040 IT INCLUDED ABOUT ONE HALF OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS A MAJORITY OF THE COUNTRY GENTLEMEN AND AT LEAST NINE TENTHS OF THE CLERGY BUT IT WAS TORN BY DISSENSIONS AND BESET ON EVERY SIDE BY DIFFICULTIES
1316-132800-0041 ONE SECTION OF THIS GREAT PARTY A SECTION WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY STRONG AMONG DIVINES AND OF WHICH SHERLOCK WAS THE CHIEF ORGAN
1316-132800-0042 IT WAS IN TRUTH AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE A MIDDLE WAY WHERE THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR A MIDDLE WAY TO EFFECT A COMPROMISE BETWEEN TWO THINGS WHICH DO NOT ADMIT OF COMPROMISE RESISTANCE AND NONRESISTANCE
1316-132800-0043 THE TORIES HAD FORMERLY TAKEN THEIR STAND ON THE PRINCIPLE OF NONRESISTANCE BUT THAT GROUND MOST OF THEM HAD NOW ABANDONED AND WERE NOT DISPOSED AGAIN TO OCCUPY THE CAVALIERS OF ENGLAND HAD AS A CLASS
1316-132800-0044 BEEN SO DEEPLY CONCERNED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN THE LATE RISING AGAINST THE KING THAT THEY COULD NOT FOR VERY SHAME TALK AT THAT MOMENT ABOUT THE SACRED DUTY OF OBEYING NERO
1316-132800-0045 THE KING OUGHT TO BE IMMEDIATELY INVITED BACK AND PERMITTED IF SUCH WERE HIS PLEASURE TO PUT SEYMOUR AND DANBY THE BISHOP OF LONDON AND THE BISHOP OF BRISTOL TO DEATH FOR HIGH TREASON TO REESTABLISH THE ECCLESIASTICAL COMMISSION
1316-132800-0046 TO FILL THE CHURCH WITH POPISH DIGNITARIES AND TO PLACE THE ARMY UNDER THE COMMAND OF POPISH OFFICERS BUT IF AS THE TORIES THEMSELVES NOW SEEMED TO CONFESS THAT THEORY WAS UNSOUND WHY TREAT WITH THE KING
1316-132800-0047 FOR WHAT SATISFACTORY GUARANTEE COULD HE GIVE HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE TO DRAW UP AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT IN LANGUAGE CLEARER THAN THE LANGUAGE OF THE ACTS OF PARLIAMENT WHICH REQUIRED THAT THE DEAN OF CHRIST CHURCH SHOULD BE A PROTESTANT
1316-132800-0048 HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE TO PUT ANY PROMISE INTO WORDS STRONGER THAN THOSE IN WHICH JAMES HAD REPEATEDLY DECLARED THAT HE WOULD STRICTLY RESPECT THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF THE ANGLICAN CLERGY IF LAW OR HONOUR COULD HAVE BOUND HIM
1316-132800-0049 HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN FORCED TO FLY FROM HIS KINGDOM IF NEITHER LAW NOR HONOUR COULD BIND HIM COULD HE SAFELY BE PERMITTED TO RETURN IT IS PROBABLE HOWEVER THAT IN SPITE OF THESE ARGUMENTS A MOTION FOR OPENING A NEGOTIATION WITH JAMES
1316-132800-0050 WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE CONVENTION AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE GREAT BODY OF TORIES HAD HE NOT BEEN ON THIS AS ON EVERY OTHER OCCASION HIS OWN WORST ENEMY
1316-132800-0051 BROUGHT INTELLIGENCE WHICH DAMPED THE ARDOUR OF HIS ADHERENTS
1316-132800-0052 AND YET WITHOUT DESPOILING HIM OF HIS CROWN THIS DEVICE WAS A REGENCY THE MOST UNCOMPROMISING OF THOSE DIVINES WHO HAD INCULCATED THE DOCTRINE OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE
1316-132800-0053 HAD NEVER MAINTAINED THAT SUCH OBEDIENCE WAS DUE TO A BABE OR TO A MADMAN IT WAS UNIVERSALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WHEN THE RIGHTFUL SOVEREIGN WAS INTELLECTUALLY INCAPABLE OF PERFORMING HIS OFFICE A DEPUTY MIGHT BE APPOINTED TO ACT IN HIS STEAD
1316-132800-0054 AND THAT ANY PERSON WHO SHOULD RESIST THE DEPUTY AND SHOULD PLEAD AS AN EXCUSE FOR DOING SO THE COMMAND OF A PRINCE WHO WAS IN THE CRADLE OR WHO WAS RAVING WOULD JUSTLY INCUR THE PENALTIES OF REBELLION STUPIDITY PERVERSENESS AND SUPERSTITION
1316-132800-0055 SUCH WAS THE REASONING OF THE PRIMATE HAD MADE JAMES AS UNFIT TO RULE HIS DOMINIONS AS ANY CHILD IN SWADDLING CLOTHES
1316-132800-0056 THAT COURSE MUST THEREFORE BE TAKEN WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN WHEN HENRY THE SIXTH WAS AN INFANT AND AGAIN WHEN HE BECAME LETHARGIC JAMES COULD NOT BE KING IN EFFECT BUT HE MUST STILL CONTINUE TO BE KING IN SEMBLANCE
1316-132800-0057 WRITS MUST STILL RUN IN HIS NAME HIS IMAGE AND SUPERSCRIPTION MUST STILL APPEAR ON THE COIN AND ON THE GREAT SEAL ACTS OF PARLIAMENT MUST STILL BE CALLED FROM THE YEARS OF HIS REIGN BUT THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE TAKEN FROM HIM
1316-132800-0058 AND CONFIDED TO A REGENT NAMED BY THE ESTATES OF THE REALM IN THIS WAY SANCROFT GRAVELY MAINTAINED THE PEOPLE WOULD REMAIN TRUE TO THEIR ALLEGIANCE THE OATHS OF FEALTY WHICH THEY HAD SWORN TO THEIR KING WOULD BE STRICTLY FULFILLED
