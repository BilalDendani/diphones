5126-36956-0000 TOBY COULD SCARCELY RESTRAIN HIMSELF AT THE PROSPECT OF THIS GOLDEN FUTURE THAT HAD SO SUDDENLY OPENED BEFORE HIM HE TRIED TO EXPRESS HIS GRATITUDE BUT COULD ONLY DO SO BY
5126-36956-0001 I DON'T BELIEVE HE'D TRY TO STOP ME SAID TOBY CONFIDENTLY
5126-36956-0002 WE WON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES MY SON WAS THE REPLY IN A VERY BENEVOLENT TONE AS HE PATTED TOBY ON THE HEAD AND AT THE SAME TIME HANDED HIM A PIECE OF PASTEBOARD THERE'S A TICKET FOR THE CIRCUS
5126-36956-0003 YOUR UNCLE DANIEL WILL HAVE HARD WORK TO FIND YOU IF TOBY HAD FOLLOWED HIS INCLINATIONS
5126-36956-0004 BUT NOT KNOWING EXACTLY HOW SUCH A SHOW OF THANKFULNESS MIGHT BE RECEIVED HE CONTENTED HIMSELF BY REPEATEDLY PROMISING THAT HE WOULD BE PUNCTUAL TO THE TIME AND PLACE APPOINTED
5126-36956-0005 HE WOULD HAVE LOITERED IN THE VICINITY OF THE CANDY STAND IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT GAIN SOME INSIGHT INTO THE BUSINESS BUT MISTER LORD ADVISED THAT HE REMAIN AWAY LEST HIS UNCLE DANIEL SHOULD SEE HIM AND SUSPECT WHERE HE HAD GONE WHEN HE WAS MISSED IN THE MORNING
5126-36956-0006 AND TO BE ABLE TO SEE ITS MANY WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL ATTRACTIONS EVERY DAY EVEN THE VERY TENT ROPES HAD ACQUIRED A NEW INTEREST FOR HIM AND THE FACES OF THE MEN AT WORK SEEMED SUDDENLY TO HAVE BECOME THOSE OF FRIENDS
5126-36956-0007 HOW HARD IT WAS FOR HIM TO WALK AROUND UNCONCERNEDLY AND HOW ESPECIALLY HARD TO PREVENT HIS FEET FROM STRAYING TOWARD THAT TEMPTING DISPLAY OF DAINTIES WHICH HE WAS TO SELL TO THOSE WHO CAME TO SEE AND ENJOY
5126-36956-0008 AND WHO WOULD LOOK AT HIM WITH WONDER AND CURIOSITY IT WAS VERY HARD NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO TELL HIS PLAYMATES OF HIS WONDERFULLY GOOD FORTUNE BUT SILENCE MEANT SUCCESS AND HE LOCKED HIS SECRET IN HIS BOSOM
5126-36956-0009 NOT EVEN DARING TO TALK WITH ANY ONE HE KNEW LEST HE SHOULD BETRAY HIMSELF BY SOME INCAUTIOUS WORD HE DID NOT GO HOME TO DINNER THAT DAY AND ONCE OR TWICE HE FELT IMPELLED TO WALK PAST THE CANDY STAND
5126-36956-0010 GIVING A MYSTERIOUS SHAKE OF THE HEAD AT THE PROPRIETOR AS HE DID SO THE AFTERNOON PERFORMANCE PASSED OFF AS USUAL TO ALL OF THE SPECTATORS SAVE TOBY HE IMAGINED THAT EACH ONE OF THE PERFORMERS
5126-36956-0011 A WINK FROM MISTER LORD MUST HAVE BEEN INTENDED TO CONVEY A GREAT DEAL BECAUSE OWING TO THE DEFECT IN HIS EYES IT REQUIRED NO LITTLE EXERTION AND EVEN THEN COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A REALLY FIRST CLASS WINK
5126-36956-0012 THAT NIGHT DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE WAS GOING TO TRAVEL WITH THE CIRCUS DESPITE THE FACT THAT HIS HOME WAS NOT A HAPPY OR CHEERFUL ONE TOBY WAS NOT IN A PLEASANT FRAME OF MIND HE BEGAN TO FEEL FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT
5126-36956-0013 AND AS HE GAZED AT UNCLE DANIEL'S STERN FORBIDDING LOOKING FACE IT SEEMED TO HAVE CHANGED SOMEWHAT FROM ITS SEVERITY AND CAUSED A GREAT LUMP OF SOMETHING TO COME UP IN HIS THROAT AS HE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS
5126-36956-0014 HE SHOULD NEVER SEE IT AGAIN JUST THEN ONE OR TWO KIND WORDS WOULD HAVE PREVENTED HIM FROM RUNNING AWAY BRIGHT AS THE PROSPECT OF CIRCUS LIFE APPEARED IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO EAT ANYTHING
5126-36956-0015 WHICH WAS USUALLY EMPTIED SO QUICKLY ARE YE SICK TOBY OR
5126-36956-0016 BUT I'VE BEEN TO THE CIRCUS AN I GOT A GOOD DEAL TO EAT OHO YOU SPENT THAT CENT I GIVE YE EH AN GOT SO MUCH THAT IT MADE YE SICK
5126-36956-0017 TOBY THOUGHT OF THE SIX PEA NUTS WHICH HE HAD BOUGHT WITH THE PENNY UNCLE DANIEL HAD GIVEN HIM AND AMID ALL HIS HOMESICKNESS HE COULD NOT HELP WONDERING IF UNCLE DANIEL EVER MADE HIMSELF SICK WITH ONLY SIX PEA NUTS WHEN HE WAS A BOY
5126-36956-0018 AS NO ONE PAID ANY FURTHER ATTENTION TO TOBY HE PUSHED BACK HIS PLATE AROSE FROM THE TABLE AND WENT WITH A HEAVY HEART TO ATTEND TO HIS REGULAR EVENING CHORES THE COW THE HENS AND
5126-36956-0019 EVEN THE PIGS CAME IN FOR A SHARE OF HIS UNUSUALLY KIND ATTENTION AND AS HE FED THEM ALL THE BIG TEARS ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS AS HE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS NEVER AGAIN WOULD HE SEE ANY OF THEM
5126-36956-0020 THESE DUMB ANIMALS HAD ALL BEEN TOBY'S CONFIDANTS HE HAD POURED OUT HIS GRIEFS IN THEIR EARS AND FANCIED WHEN THE WORLD OR UNCLE DANIEL HAD USED HIM UNUSUALLY HARD THAT THEY SYMPATHIZED WITH HIM
5126-36956-0021 AS HE LOCKED THE STABLE DOOR HE COULD HEAR THE SOUNDS OF MUSIC COMING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE CIRCUS GROUNDS AND HE WAS ANGRY AT IT BECAUSE IT REPRESENTED THAT WHICH WAS TAKING HIM AWAY FROM HIS HOME
5126-36956-0022 DOWN THE ROAD TO THE CIRCUS MISTER LORD SAW HIM AS SOON AS HE ARRIVED ON THE GROUNDS AND AS HE PASSED ANOTHER TICKET TO TOBY HE TOOK HIS BUNDLE FROM HIM SAYING AS HE DID SO I'LL PACK UP YOUR BUNDLE WITH MY THINGS
5126-36956-0023 TO KNOW THAT THEY MIGHT BE HOMESICK ON THE EVE OF STARTING TO TRAVEL WITH A CIRCUS AND IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT TOBY WOULD KEEP TO HIS ENGAGEMENT HE WAS UNUSUALLY KIND
5126-36956-0024 THAT LUMP IN HIS THROAT WOULD REMAIN THERE AND THE THOUGHTS OF WHAT HE WAS ABOUT TO DO WOULD TROUBLE HIM SEVERELY THE PERFORMANCE FAILED TO INTEREST HIM
5126-36956-0025 AND THE ANIMALS DID NOT ATTRACT UNTIL HE HAD VISITED THE MONKEY CAGE FOR THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THEN HE FANCIED THAT THE SAME VENERABLE MONKEY WHO HAD LOOKED SO KNOWING IN THE AFTERNOON WAS GAZING AT HIM WITH A SADNESS
5126-36956-0026 IT WOULD NOT HAVE SURPRISED THE BOY JUST THEN IF THE ANIMAL HAD SPOKEN BUT AS HE DID NOT TOBY DID THE NEXT BEST THING
5126-36956-0027 A GOOD TIME NOW BUT I S'POSE I MUST CAUSE
5126-36956-0028 CAUSE THE CANDY MAN HAS GOT ALL MY THINGS THE BIG TEARS HAD BEGUN TO ROLL DOWN TOBY'S CHEEKS AND AS HE CEASED SPEAKING THE MONKEY REACHED OUT ONE LITTLE PAW
5126-36956-0029 WHICH TOBY TOOK AS EARNESTLY AS IF IT HAD BEEN DONE PURPOSELY TO CONSOLE HIM YOU'RE REAL GOOD YOU ARE CONTINUED TOBY
5126-36956-0030 FOR IT SEEMS TO ME NOW WHEN THERE HAIN'T ANY FOLKS AROUND AS IF YOU WAS THE ONLY FRIEND I'VE GOT IN THIS GREAT BIG WORLD IT'S AWFUL WHEN A FELLER FEELS THE WAY I DO AN WHEN HE DON'T SEEM TO WANT ANYTHING TO EAT
5126-36956-0031 AND CONTINUED TO GAZE INTO THE BOY'S FACE THE FELLERS ALL SAY I DON'T AMOUNT TO ANYTHING SOBBED TOBY
5126-36956-0032 I S'POSE THEY KNOW BUT
5126-36956-0033 AN DON'T FORGET THAT TOBY TYLER IS FEELIN WORSE TO NIGHT THAN IF HE WAS TWICE AS BIG AN TWICE AS GOOD MISTER LORD HAD COME TO SUMMON HIM AWAY AND
5126-36956-0034 HE NOW TOLD TOBY THAT HE WOULD SHOW HIM WITH WHICH MAN HE WAS TO RIDE THAT NIGHT TOBY LOOKED ANOTHER GOOD BYE AT THE VENERABLE MONKEY WHO WAS WATCHING HIM CLOSELY AND THEN FOLLOWED HIS EMPLOYER OUT OF THE TENT
