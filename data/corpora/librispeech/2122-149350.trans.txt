2122-149350-0002 WE HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING AT THAT YET MISTER ARNOLD NOT DONE ANYTHING AT GEOGRAPHY AND THE BOY GETTING QUITE ROBUST NOW I AM ASTONISHED MISTER SUTHERLAND WHY WHEN HE WAS A MERE CHILD HE COULD REPEAT ALL THE COUNTIES OF ENGLAND

2122-149350-0004 A THOROUGH GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE IS ESSENTIAL TO THE EDUCATION OF A GENTLEMAN ASK ME ANY QUESTION YOU PLEASE MISTER SUTHERLAND ON THE MAP OF THE WORLD OR ANY OF ITS DIVISIONS HUGH ASKED A FEW QUESTIONS WHICH MISTER ARNOLD ANSWERED AT ONCE
2122-149350-0005 POOH POOH SAID HE THIS IS MERE CHILD'S PLAY LET ME ASK YOU SOME MISTER SUTHERLAND HIS VERY FIRST QUESTION POSED HUGH WHOSE KNOWLEDGE IN THIS SCIENCE WAS NOT BY ANY MEANS MINUTE

2122-149350-0007 LET ME HAVE MY OWN WAY IN THIS TOO BUT GEOGRAPHY DOES NOT SEEM YOUR STRONG POINT NO BUT I MAY BE ABLE TO TEACH IT ALL THE BETTER FROM FEELING THE DIFFICULTIES OF A LEARNER MYSELF WELL YOU SHALL HAVE A FAIR TRIAL
2122-149350-0008 NEXT MORNING HUGH AND HARRY WENT OUT FOR A WALK TO THE TOP OF A HILL IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHEN THEY REACHED IT HUGH TOOK A SMALL COMPASS FROM HIS POCKET AND SET IT ON THE GROUND CONTEMPLATING IT AND THE HORIZON ALTERNATELY
2122-149350-0009 WHAT ARE YOU DOING MISTER SUTHERLAND I AM TRYING TO FIND THE EXACT LINE THAT WOULD GO THROUGH MY HOME SAID HE IS THAT FUNNY LITTLE THING ABLE TO TELL YOU YES
2122-149350-0010 THIS ALONG WITH OTHER THINGS ISN'T IT CURIOUS HARRY TO HAVE IN MY POCKET A LITTLE THING WITH A KIND OF SPIRIT IN IT THAT UNDERSTANDS THE SPIRIT THAT IS IN THE BIG WORLD AND ALWAYS POINTS TO ITS NORTH POLE EXPLAIN IT TO ME
2122-149350-0011 IT IS NEARLY AS MUCH A MYSTERY TO ME AS TO YOU WHERE IS THE NORTH POLE LOOK THE LITTLE THING POINTS TO IT BUT I WILL TURN IT AWAY OH IT WON'T GO IT GOES BACK AND BACK DO WHAT I WILL
2122-149350-0012 YES IT WILL IF YOU TURN IT AWAY ALL DAY LONG LOOK HARRY IF YOU WERE TO GO STRAIGHT ON IN THIS DIRECTION YOU WOULD COME TO A LAPLANDER HARNESSING HIS BROAD HORNED REINDEER TO HIS SLEDGE HE'S AT IT NOW I DARESAY
2122-149350-0013 IF YOU WERE TO GO IN THIS LINE EXACTLY YOU WOULD GO THROUGH THE SMOKE AND FIRE OF A BURNING MOUNTAIN IN A LAND OF ICE IF YOU WERE TO GO THIS WAY STRAIGHT ON YOU WOULD FIND YOURSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOREST WITH A LION GLARING AT YOUR FEET
2122-149350-0014 FOR IT IS DARK NIGHT THERE NOW AND SO HOT AND OVER THERE STRAIGHT ON THERE IS SUCH A LOVELY SUNSET THE TOP OF A SNOWY MOUNTAIN IS ALL PINK WITH LIGHT THOUGH THE SUN IS DOWN OH SUCH COLOURS ALL ABOUT LIKE FAIRYLAND
2122-149350-0015 AND THERE THERE IS A DESERT OF SAND AND A CAMEL DYING AND ALL HIS COMPANIONS JUST DISAPPEARING ON THE HORIZON AND THERE THERE IS AN AWFUL SEA WITHOUT A BOAT TO BE SEEN ON IT DARK AND DISMAL WITH HUGE ROCKS ALL ABOUT IT
2122-149350-0016 AND WASTE BORDERS OF SAND SO DREADFUL HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THIS MISTER SUTHERLAND YOU HAVE NEVER WALKED ALONG THOSE LINES I KNOW FOR YOU COULDN'T GEOGRAPHY HAS TAUGHT ME NO MISTER SUTHERLAND SAID HARRY INCREDULOUSLY
2122-149350-0017 WELL SHALL WE TRAVEL ALONG THIS LINE JUST ACROSS THAT CROWN OF TREES ON THE HILL YES DO LET US THEN SAID HUGH DRAWING A TELESCOPE FROM HIS POCKET THIS HILL IS HENCEFORTH GEOGRAPHY POINT
2122-149350-0018 AND ALL THE WORLD LIES ROUND ABOUT IT DO YOU KNOW WE ARE IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE EARTH ARE WE INDEED YES DON'T YOU KNOW ANY POINT YOU LIKE TO CHOOSE ON A BALL IS THE MIDDLE OF IT
2122-149350-0019 OH YES OF COURSE VERY WELL WHAT LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL DOWN THERE ARNSTEAD TO BE SURE AND WHAT BEYOND THERE I DON'T KNOW LOOK THROUGH HERE
2122-149350-0020 OH THAT MUST BE THE VILLAGE WE RODE TO YESTERDAY I FORGET THE NAME OF IT HUGH TOLD HIM THE NAME AND THEN MADE HIM LOOK WITH THE TELESCOPE ALL ALONG THE RECEDING LINE TO THE TREES ON THE OPPOSITE HILL JUST AS HE CAUGHT THEM A VOICE BESIDE THEM SAID
2122-149350-0021 WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT HARRY HUGH FELT A GLOW OF PLEASURE AS THE VOICE FELL ON HIS EAR IT WAS EUPHRA'S OH REPLIED HARRY MISTER SUTHERLAND IS TEACHING ME GEOGRAPHY WITH A TELESCOPE IT'S SUCH FUN
2122-149350-0022 HE'S A WONDERFUL TUTOR THAT OF YOURS HARRY YES ISN'T HE JUST BUT HARRY WENT ON TURNING TO HUGH WHAT ARE WE TO DO NOW WE CAN'T GET FARTHER FOR THAT HILL
2122-149350-0023 AH WE MUST APPLY TO YOUR PAPA NOW TO LEND US SOME OF HIS BEAUTIFUL MAPS THEY WILL TEACH US WHAT LIES BEYOND THAT HILL AND THEN WE CAN READ IN SOME OF HIS BOOKS ABOUT THE PLACES AND SO GO ON AND ON TILL WE REACH THE BEAUTIFUL WIDE RESTLESS SEA
2122-149350-0024 OVER WHICH WE MUST SAIL IN SPITE OF WIND AND TIDE STRAIGHT ON AND ON TILL WE COME TO LAND AGAIN BUT WE MUST MAKE A GREAT MANY SUCH JOURNEYS BEFORE WE REALLY KNOW WHAT SORT OF A PLACE WE ARE LIVING IN AND WE SHALL HAVE EVER SO MANY THINGS TO LEARN THAT WILL SURPRISE US
2122-149350-0025 OH IT WILL BE NICE CRIED HARRY AFTER A LITTLE MORE GEOGRAPHICAL TALK THEY PUT UP THEIR INSTRUMENTS AND BEGAN TO DESCEND THE HILL HARRY WAS IN NO NEED OF HUGH'S BACK NOW BUT EUPHRA WAS IN NEED OF HIS HAND
2122-149350-0026 HOW AWKWARD OF ME I AM STUMBLING OVER THE HEATHER SHAMEFULLY SHE WAS IN FACT STUMBLING OVER HER OWN DRESS WHICH SHE WOULD NOT HOLD UP HUGH OFFERED HIS HAND AND HER SMALL ONE SEEMED QUITE CONTENT TO BE SWALLOWED UP IN HIS LARGE ONE
2122-149350-0027 WHY DO YOU NEVER LET ME PUT YOU ON YOUR HORSE SAID HUGH YOU ALWAYS MANAGE TO PREVENT ME SOMEHOW OR OTHER
2122-149350-0028 MISTER SUTHERLAND I BEG YOUR PARDON I CAN MAKE NO EXCUSE FOR EUPHRA FOR SHE HAD POSITIVELY NEVER HEARD HIM CALLED HUGH THERE WAS NO ONE TO DO SO BUT THE SLIP HAD NOT THEREFORE THE LESS EFFECT
2122-149350-0029 FOR IT SOUNDED AS IF SHE HAD BEEN SAYING HIS NAME OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO HERSELF I BEG YOUR PARDON REPEATED EUPHRA HASTILY FOR AS HUGH DID NOT REPLY SHE FEARED HER ARROW HAD SWERVED FROM ITS MARK
2122-149350-0030 FOR A SWEET FAULT EUPHRA I BEG YOUR PARDON MISS CAMERON YOU PUNISH ME WITH FORGIVENESS RETURNED SHE WITH ONE OF HER SWEETEST LOOKS HUGH COULD NOT HELP PRESSING THE LITTLE HAND
2122-149350-0031 WAS THE PRESSURE RETURNED SO SLIGHT SO AIRY WAS THE TOUCH THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONLY THE THROB OF HIS OWN PULSES ALL CONSCIOUSLY VITAL ABOUT THE WONDERFUL WOMAN HAND THAT RESTED IN HIS
2122-149350-0032 IF HE HAD CLAIMED IT SHE MIGHT EASILY HAVE DENIED IT SO ETHEREAL AND UNCERTAIN WAS IT YET HE BELIEVED IN IT HE NEVER DREAMED THAT SHE WAS EXERCISING HER SKILL UPON HIM WHAT COULD BE HER OBJECT IN BEWITCHING A POOR TUTOR AH WHAT INDEED
2122-149350-0033 MEANTIME THIS MUCH IS CERTAIN THAT SHE WAS DRAWING HUGH CLOSER AND CLOSER TO HER SIDE THAT A SOOTHING DREAM OF DELIGHT HAD BEGUN TO STEAL OVER HIS SPIRIT SOON TO MAKE IT TOSS IN FEVEROUS UNREST
2122-149350-0034 AS THE FIRST EFFECTS OF SOME POISONS ARE LIKE A DAWN OF TENFOLD STRENGTH THE MOUNTAIN WIND BLEW FROM HER TO HIM SOMETIMES SWEEPING HER GARMENTS ABOUT HIM AND BATHING HIM IN THEIR FAINT SWEET ODOURS
2122-149350-0035 ODOURS WHICH SOMEHOW SEEMED TO BELONG TO HER WHOM THEY HAD ONLY LAST VISITED SOMETIMES SO KINDLY STRONG DID IT BLOW COMPELLING HER OR AT LEAST GIVING HER EXCUSE ENOUGH TO LEAVE HIS HAND AND CLING CLOSELY TO HIS ARM
2122-149350-0036 A FRESH SPRING BEGAN TO BURST FROM THE VERY BOSOM OF WHAT HAD SEEMED BEFORE A PERFECT SUMMER A SPRING TO SUMMER WHAT WOULD THE FOLLOWING SUMMER BE AH AND WHAT THE AUTUMN AND WHAT THE WINTER
2122-149350-0037 FOR IF THE SUMMER BE TENFOLD SUMMER THEN MUST THE WINTER BE TENFOLD WINTER
2122-149350-0038 AND THOUGH LOVE BE GOOD A TEMPEST OF IT IN THE BRAIN WILL NOT RIPEN THE FRUITS LIKE A SOFT STEADY WIND OR WAFT THE SHIPS HOME TO THEIR DESIRED HAVEN PERHAPS WHAT ENSLAVED HUGH MOST WAS THE FEELING THAT THE DAMSEL STOOPED TO HIM
2122-149350-0039 WITHOUT KNOWING THAT SHE STOOPED SHE SEEMED TO HIM IN EVERY WAY ABOVE HIM SHE KNEW SO MANY THINGS OF WHICH HE WAS IGNORANT COULD SAY SUCH LOVELY THINGS COULD HE DID NOT DOUBT WRITE LOVELY VERSES COULD SING LIKE AN ANGEL
2122-149350-0040 THOUGH SCOTCH SONGS ARE NOT OF ESSENTIALLY ANGELIC STRAIN NOR ITALIAN SONGS EITHER IN GENERAL AND THEY WERE ALL THAT SHE COULD DO WAS MISTRESS OF A GREAT RICH WONDERFUL HOUSE WITH A HISTORY
2122-149350-0041 AND MORE THAN ALL WAS OR APPEARED TO HIM TO BE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IT WAS TRUE THAT HIS FAMILY WAS AS GOOD AS HERS BUT HE HAD DISOWNED HIS FAMILY SO HIS PRIDE DECLARED AND THE SAME PRIDE MADE HIM
2122-149350-0042 DESPISE HIS PRESENT POSITION AND LOOK UPON A TUTOR'S EMPLOYMENT AS AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE LOOK UPON IT AS A RATHER CONTEMPTIBLE ONE IN FACT
2122-149350-0043 THE INFLUENCE OF EUPHRASIA WAS NOT OF THE BEST UPON HIM FROM THE FIRST FOR IT HAD GREATLY INCREASED THIS FEELING ABOUT HIS OCCUPATION IT COULD NOT AFFECT HIS FEELINGS TOWARDS HARRY SO THE BOY DID NOT SUFFER AS YET
2122-149350-0044 BUT IT SET HIM UPON A VERY UNPROFITABLE KIND OF CASTLE BUILDING HE WOULD BE A SOLDIER LIKE HIS FATHER HE WOULD LEAVE ARNSTEAD TO REVISIT IT WITH A SWORD BY HIS SIDE AND A SIR BEFORE HIS NAME
2122-149350-0045 SIR HUGH SUTHERLAND WOULD BE SOMEBODY EVEN IN THE EYES OF THE MASTER OF ARNSTEAD YES A SIX FOOT FELLOW THOUGH HE MAY BE SENSIBLE IN THE MAIN IS NOT THEREFORE FREE FROM SMALL VANITIES
