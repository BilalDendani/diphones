2541-185493-0002 HOW A SHINGLE STUMPED THE SPIRITS
2541-185493-0003 FOR INSTANCE I RECEIVED NOT LONG AGO FROM MY GOOD FRIENDS MESSRS CAULDWELL AND WHITNEY AN ANONYMOUS LETTER TO THEM DATED AT WASHINGTON AND SUGGESTING THAT IF I WOULD ATTEND WHAT THE LATTER CALLS
2541-185493-0004 A SEANCE OF THAT CELEBRATED HUMBUG FOSTER I SHOULD SEE SOMETHING THAT I COULD NOT EXPLAIN NOW THIS ANONYMOUS LETTER AS I KNOW BY A SPIRITUAL COMMUNICATION OR OTHERWISE
2541-185493-0005 IS IN A HANDWRITING VERY WONDERFULLY LIKE THAT OF MISTER FOSTER HIMSELF AND AS FOR THE SUBSTANCE OF IT IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT FOSTER HAS NOW GOTTEN UP SOME NEW TRICKS HE NEEDS THEM
2541-185493-0006 THE EXHIBITING MEDIUMS MUST OF COURSE CONTRIVE NEW TRICKS
2541-185493-0007 SHOW UP THEIR OLD ONES IT IS THE UNIVERSAL METHOD OF ALL SORTS OF IMPOSTORS
2541-185493-0008 S B BRITTAN THE EX UNIVERSALIST MINISTER THE VERY SURPRISINGLY EFFICIENT MAN FRIDAY OF ANDREW JACKSON DAVIS IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE REVELATIONS OF THE SAID DAVIS
2541-185493-0009 AND ALSO GHOST FANCIER IN GENERAL WHO HAS GENTLY AIRED PART OF HIS VOCABULARY IN A COMMUNICATION TO THE BANNER OF LIGHT WITH THE HEADING EXPOSED FOR TWO SHILLINGS I CAN AFFORD VERY WELL TO EXPOSE FRIEND BRITTAN
2541-185493-0010 AND HIS SPIRITUALIST HUMBUGS FOR TWO SHILLINGS THE HONESTER THE CHEAPER IT EVIDENTLY VEXES THE SPIRITUALISTS
2541-185493-0011 THEY CAN'T HELP IT THOUGH AND IT IS MY DELIBERATE OPINION THAT THE MONKEYS ARE MUCH THE MOST RESPECTABLE I HAVE NO WISH TO DISPLEASE ANY HONEST PERSON
2541-185493-0012 THE MORE THEY SHOW THAT I AM HURTING THEM OR DOES MY FRIEND BRITTAN HIMSELF WANT AN ENGAGEMENT AT THE MUSEUM WILL HE PRODUCE SOME MANIFESTATIONS THERE
2541-185493-0013 A VALUED FRIEND OF MINE HAS FURNISHED ME A PLEASANT AND TRUE NARRATIVE OF A FINE SPIRITUAL HUMBUG WHICH TOOK PLACE IN A RESPECTABLE MASSACHUSETTS VILLAGE NOT VERY LONG AGO I GIVE THE STORY IN HIS OWN GRAPHIC WORDS
2541-185493-0014 TWO ARTISTS OF BOSTON TIRED OF THE ATMOSPHERE OF THEIR STUDIOS RESOLVED THEMSELVES IN JOINT SESSION INTO SPIRITUAL MEDIUMS AS A MEANS OF RAISING THE WIND OR THE DEVIL AND OF GETTING A LITTLE FRESH AIR IN THE RURAL DISTRICTS
2541-185493-0015 AND THAT OF WRITING ON THE ARMS THEY HAD LARGE HANDBILLS PRINTED ANNOUNCING THAT MISTER W HOWARD THE CELEBRATED TEST MEDIUM
2541-185493-0016 ONE OF THE ARTISTS PRECEDED THE OTHER BY A FEW HOURS ENGAGED ROOMS AND ATTENDED TO SUNDRY PRELIMINARIES MISTER HOWARD DONNED A WHITE CHOKER PUT HIS HAIR BEHIND HIS EARS
2541-185493-0017 AND MOUNTED A PAIR OF PLAIN GLASS SPECTACLES AND SUCH WAS HIS PROFOUNDLY SPIRITUAL APPEARANCE ON ENTERING HIS APARTMENTS AT THE HOTEL THAT HE HAD TO LOCK THE DOOR
2541-185493-0018 AND GIVE HIS PARTNER OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLODE AND ABSOLUTELY ROLL ABOUT ON THE FLOOR WITH LAUGHTER WELL THEY RIGGED A CLOTHES HORSE FOR A SCREEN AND TO HEIGHTEN THE EFFECT THE ASSISTANT WHO WAS EXPERT IN PORTRAITURE
2541-185493-0019 COVERED THIS SCREEN AND INDEED THE WALLS OF THE ROOM WITH SCRAGGY OUTLINES OF THE HUMAN COUNTENANCE UPON LARGE SHEETS OF PAPER THESE THEY SAID WERE EXECUTED BY THE DRAFTSMAN WHOSE RIGHT HAND WHEN UNDER SPIRITUAL INFLUENCE
2541-185493-0020 UNCONTROLLABLY JERKED OFF THESE LIKENESSES THEY ADDED THAT THE SPIRITS HAD GIVEN INFORMATION THAT BEFORE THE MEDIUMS LEFT TOWN
2541-185493-0021 AS THEY WERE FROM TIME TO TIME RECOGNIZED BY SURVIVING FRIENDS THE OPERATION OF DRAWING PORTRAITS WAS ALSO ILLUSTRATED AT CERTAIN HOURS ADMISSION FIFTY CENTS IF NOT SATISFACTORY THE MONEY RETURNED
2541-185493-0022 OTHER TRICKS OF VARIOUS KINDS WERE PERFORMED WITH PLEASURE TO ALL PARTIES AND PROFIT TO THE PERFORMERS THE ARTISTS STOOD IT AS LONG AS THEY COULD AND THEN DEPARTED
2541-185493-0023 BUT THERE WAS EVERY INDICATION THAT THE TOWNS PEOPLE WOULD HAVE STOOD IT UNTIL THIS DAY THUS FAR MY FRIEND'S CURIOUS AND TRUTHFUL ACCOUNT A LITTLE WHILE AGO THERE WAS EXHIBITING AT WASHINGTON A TEST MEDIUM WHOSE NAME I WOULD PRINT
2541-185493-0024 WERE IT NOT THAT I DO NOT WANT TO ADVERTISE HIM ONE OF HIS MOST IMPRESSIVE FEATS WAS TO CAUSE SPIRITUAL HANDS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE HUMAN FRAME TO APPEAR IN THE AIR A LA DAVENPORT BROTHERS
2541-185493-0025 A GENTLEMAN WHOSE NAME I ALSO KNOW VERY WELL INDEED BUT HAVE PARTICULAR REASONS FOR NOT MENTIONING WENT ONE DAY TO SEE THIS TEST MEDIUM ALONG WITH A FRIEND AND ASKED TO SEE A HAND
2541-185493-0026 CERTAINLY THE MEDIUM SAID AND THE ROOM WAS DARKENED AND THE CIRCLE MADE ROUND THE TABLE IN THE USUAL MANNER AFTER ABOUT FIVE MINUTES MY FRIEND WHO HAD CONTRIVED TO PLACE HIMSELF PRETTY NEAR THE MEDIUM
2541-185493-0027 SAW SURE ENOUGH A DIM GLIMMERING BLUE LIGHT IN THE AIR A FOOT OR SO BEFORE AND ABOVE THE HEAD OF THE MEDIUM IN A MINUTE HE COULD SEE DIMLY OUTLINED IN THIS BLUE LIGHT THE FORM OF A HAND
2541-185493-0028 BACK TOWARD HIM FINGERS TOGETHER AND NO THUMB WHY IS NO THUMB VISIBLE ASKED MY FRIEND OF THE MEDIUM IN A SOLEMN MANNER THE REASON IS SAID THE MEDIUM STILL MORE SOLEMNLY THAT THE SPIRITS HAVE NOT POWER ENOUGH
2541-185493-0029 STRANGE TO RELATE HE CAUGHT IT AND HELD IT STOUTLY TO A LIGHT WAS QUICKLY HAD WHEN STILL STRANGER THE SPIRIT HAND WAS CLEARLY SEEN TO BE THE FLESHY PAW OF THE MEDIUM
2541-185493-0030 AND A FAT PAW IT WAS TOO MISTER MEDIUM TOOK THE MATTER WITH THE COOLNESS OF A THOROUGH RASCAL AND LIGHTING A CIGAR MERELY OBSERVED WELL GENTLEMEN YOU NEEDN'T TROUBLE YOURSELVES TO COME HERE ANY MORE
2541-185493-0031 HE ALSO INSISTED ON HIS USUAL FEE OF FIVE DOLLARS UNTIL THREATENED WITH A PROSECUTION FOR SWINDLING THE SECRET OF THIS WORTHY GENTLEMAN IS SIMPLE AND SOON TOLD HOLDING ONE HAND UP IN THE AIR
2541-185493-0032 HE HELD UP WITH THE OTHER BETWEEN THE THUMB AND FINGER A LITTLE PINCH OF PHOSPHORUS AND BI SULPHIDE OF CARBON WHICH GAVE THE BLUE LIGHT IF INCONVENIENT TO HOLD UP THE OTHER HAND
2541-185493-0033 UNDER THAT INVISIBLE THUMB IT IS A CURIOUS INSTANCE OF THE THOROUGH CREDULITY OF GENUINE SPIRITUALISTS
2541-185493-0034 AT AN EXHIBITION BY A CERTAIN PAIR OF SPIRITUAL BROTHERS SINCE WELL KNOWN AS THE DAVENPORT BROTHERS THESE CHAPS AFTER THE FASHION OF THEIR KIND CAUSED THEMSELVES TO BE TIED UP IN A ROPE AN OLD SEA CAPTAIN TYING THEM
2541-185493-0035 THIS DONE THEIR SHOP OR CABINET WAS SHUT UPON THEM AS USUAL AND THE BANGS THROWING OF STICKS ET CETERA THROUGH A WINDOW AND THE LIKE TOOK PLACE WELL THIS SLY AND INCONVENIENT OLD SEA CAPTAIN
2541-185493-0036 NOW SLIPPED OUT OF THE HALL A FEW MINUTES AND CAME BACK WITH SOME WHEAT FLOUR HAVING TIED UP THE BROTHERS AGAIN HE REMARKED NOW GENTLEMEN PLEASE TO TAKE EACH YOUR TWO HANDS FULL OF WHEAT FLOUR
2541-185493-0037 THE BROTHERS GOT MAD AND FLATLY REFUSED THEN THEY COOLED DOWN AND ARGUED SAYING IT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE AND WAS OF NO USE WELL SAID THE ANCIENT MARINER IF IT WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE
2541-185493-0038 YOU CAN JUST AS WELL DO IT CAN'T YOU THE AUDIENCE SEEING THE POINT WERE SO EVIDENTLY PLEASED WITH THE OLD SAILOR THAT THE GRUMBLING BROTHERS THOUGH WITH A VERY BAD GRACE TOOK THEIR FISTS FULL OF FLOUR AND WERE SHUT UP
2541-185493-0039 THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST SIGN OF A MANIFESTATION NO MORE THAN IF THE WHEAT FLOUR HAD SHOT THE BROTHERS DEAD IN THEIR TRACKS
2541-185493-0040 THE BROTHERS SINCE THAT TIME HAVE LEARNED TO PERFORM SOME TRICKS WITH FLOUR IN THEIR FISTS BUT ONLY WHEN TIED BY THEIR OWN FRIENDS SINCE THESE FACTS CAME TO MY KNOWLEDGE
2541-185493-0041 THE DAVENPORT BROTHERS HAVE SUFFERED AN UNPLEASANT EXPOSURE IN LIVERPOOL IN ENGLAND
2541-185493-0042 BY ATTENTIVE FRIENDS THERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN QUESTION OCCURRED ON THE EVENINGS OF TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEEN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE ON THE FIRST OF THESE EVENINGS A GENTLEMAN NAMED CUMMINS
2541-185493-0043 SELECTED BY THE AUDIENCE AS ONE OF THE TYING COMMITTEE TIED ONE OF THE BROTHERS AND A MISTER HULLEY THE OTHER COMMITTEE MAN THE OTHER BUT THE BROTHERS SAW INSTANTLY THAT THEY COULD NOT WRIGGLE OUT OF THESE KNOTS
2541-185493-0044 THEY THEREFORE REFUSED TO LET THE TYING BE FINISHED SAYING THAT IT WAS BRUTAL ALTHOUGH A SURGEON PRESENT SAID IT WAS NOT ONE TIED BROTHER WAS UNTIED BY FERGUSON THE AGENT
2541-185493-0045 AND THEN THE BROTHERS WENT TO WORK AND PERFORMED THEIR VARIOUS TRICKS WITHOUT THE SUPERVISION OF ANY COMMITTEE BUT AMID A CONSTANT FIRE OF DERISION LAUGHTER GROANS SHOUTS AND EPITHETS FROM THE AUDIENCE ON THE NEXT EVENING
2541-185493-0046 THE AUDIENCE INSISTED ON HAVING THE SAME COMMITTEE THE BROTHERS WERE VERY RELUCTANT TO ALLOW IT BUT HAD TO DO SO AFTER A LONG TIME IRA DAVENPORT REFUSED AGAIN HOWEVER INSTANTLY TO BE TIED
2541-185493-0047 AS SOON AS HE SAW WHAT KNOT MISTER CUMMINS WAS GOING TO USE CUMMINS HOWEVER THOUGH IRA SQUIRMED MOST INDUSTRIOUSLY GOT HIM TIED FAST AND THEN IRA CALLED TO FERGUSON TO CUT THE KNOT FERGUSON DID SO
2541-185493-0048 AND CUT IRA'S HAND IRA NOW SHEWED THE BLOOD TO THE AUDIENCE AND THE BROTHERS WITH AN IMMENSE PRETENSE OF INDIGNATION WENT OFF THE STAGE CUMMINS AT ONCE EXPLAINED
2541-185493-0049 THE AUDIENCE BECAME DISGUSTED AND ENRAGED AT THE IMPUDENCE OF THE IMPOSTURE BROKE OVER THE FOOT LIGHTS KNOCKED FERGUSON BACKWARD INTO THE CABINET AND WHEN THE DISCOMFITED AGENT HAD SCRAMBLED OUT AND RUN AWAY SMASHED THE THING FAIRLY INTO KINDLING WOOD
2541-185493-0050 WHICH THEY DID NOT SEE THE VERY THOROUGH EXPOSURE OF THE DAVENPORTS THUS MADE IS AN ADDITIONAL PROOF IF SUCH WERE NEEDED
2541-185493-0051 BY THEM AND THEIR MYSTERIOUS BRETHREN OF THE EXHIBITING SORT ONCE THE SPIRITS WERE STUMPED WITH A SHINGLE A VERY PROPER YANKEE JAW BONE OF AN ASS TO ROUTE SUCH DISEMBODIED PHILISTINES
2541-185493-0052 UPON THE FLOOR THERE SAID HE COOLLY IF YOU CAN TROT THOSE TABLES ABOUT IN THAT STYLE DO IT WITH THAT SHINGLE
