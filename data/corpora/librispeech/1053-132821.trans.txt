1053-132821-0000 FOR IT WAS SUMMER AND EVERYONE ROSE EARLY AND RESTED FROM TWELVE TO THREE AS THEY DO IN HOT COUNTRIES HE HAD DRESSED HIMSELF IN COOL WHITE CLOTHES AND WAS PASSING THROUGH THE HALL ON HIS WAY TO THE COUNCIL CHAMBER
1053-132821-0001 WHEN A NUMBER OF YOUNG NOBLES SUDDENLY APPEARED BEFORE HIM AND ONE AMONGST THEM STEPPED FORWARD AND SPOKE SIRE THIS MORNING WE WERE ALL PLAYING TENNIS IN THE COURT THE PRINCE AND THIS GENTLEMAN WITH THE REST
1053-132821-0002 SO THAT THE BLOOD RAN FROM HIS MOUTH AND NOSE WE WERE ALL SO HORRIFIED AT THE SIGHT THAT WE SHOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE KILLED THE MAN THEN AND THERE FOR DARING TO LAY HANDS ON THE PRINCE
1053-132821-0003 HAD NOT HIS GRANDFATHER THE DUKE STEPPED BETWEEN AND COMMANDED US TO LAY THE AFFAIR BEFORE YOU THE KING HAD LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO THE STORY AND WHEN IT WAS ENDED HE SAID I SUPPOSE THE PRINCE HAD NO ARMS WITH HIM OR ELSE HE WOULD HAVE USED THEM
1053-132821-0004 BUT WHEN HE SAW THE BLOOD POURING FROM HIS FACE HE WENT TO A CORNER OF THE COURT AND BEGAN TO CRY WHICH WAS THE STRANGEST THING OF ALL ON HEARING THIS THE KING WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND STOOD FOR A FEW MINUTES WITH HIS BACK TO THE ROOM
1053-132821-0005 WHERE THE COMPANY OF YOUNG MEN REMAINED SILENT THEN HE CAME BACK HIS FACE WHITE AND STERN I TELL YOU HE SAID AND IT IS THE SOLEMN TRUTH THAT I WOULD RATHER YOU HAD TOLD ME THAT THE PRINCE WAS DEAD THOUGH HE IS MY ONLY SON
1053-132821-0006 THAN KNOW THAT HE WOULD SUFFER SUCH AN INJURY WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO AVENGE IT AS FOR THE GENTLEMAN WHO STRUCK HIM HE WILL BE BROUGHT BEFORE MY JUDGES AND WILL PLEAD HIS OWN CAUSE BUT I HARDLY THINK HE CAN ESCAPE DEATH AFTER HAVING ASSAULTED THE HEIR TO THE CROWN
1053-132821-0007 AND IN FIFTEEN DAYS HE WOULD BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL BEFORE THE HIGHEST JUDGES IN THE LAND THE YOUNG MAN LEFT THE KING'S PRESENCE SURROUNDED BY SOLDIERS AND ACCOMPANIED BY MANY OF HIS FRIENDS FOR HE WAS A GREAT FAVOURITE
1053-132821-0008 BY THEIR ADVICE HE SPENT THE FOURTEEN DAYS THAT REMAINED TO HIM GOING ABOUT TO SEEK COUNSEL FROM WISE MEN OF ALL SORTS AS TO HOW HE MIGHT ESCAPE DEATH BUT NO ONE COULD HELP HIM
1053-132821-0009 FOR NONE COULD FIND ANY EXCUSE FOR THE BLOW HE HAD GIVEN TO THE PRINCE THE FOURTEENTH NIGHT HAD COME AND IN DESPAIR THE PRISONER WENT OUT TO TAKE HIS LAST WALK THROUGH THE CITY HE WANDERED ON HARDLY KNOWING WHERE HE WENT
1053-132821-0010 AND HIS FACE WAS SO WHITE AND DESPERATE THAT NONE OF HIS COMPANIONS DARED SPEAK TO HIM THE SAD LITTLE PROCESSION HAD PASSED SOME HOURS IN THIS MANNER WHEN NEAR THE GATE OF A MONASTERY AN OLD WOMAN APPEARED ROUND A CORNER
1053-132821-0011 AND HOW YOU ARE SEEKING IF IN ANY WISE YOU CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE BUT THERE IS NONE THAT CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION SAVE ONLY I MYSELF IF YOU WILL PROMISE TO DO ALL I ASK AT HER WORDS THE PRISONER FELT AS IF A LOAD HAD ALL AT ONCE BEEN ROLLED OFF HIM
1053-132821-0012 IT IS SO HARD TO LEAVE THE WORLD AND GO OUT INTO THE DARKNESS YOU WILL NOT NEED TO DO THAT ANSWERED THE OLD WOMAN YOU HAVE ONLY GOT TO MARRY ME AND YOU WILL SOON BE FREE MARRY YOU EXCLAIMED HE BUT BUT I AM NOT YET TWENTY AND YOU
1053-132821-0013 WHY YOU MUST BE A HUNDRED AT LEAST OH NO IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE HE SPOKE WITHOUT THINKING BUT THE FLASH OF ANGER WHICH DARTED FROM HER EYES MADE HIM FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE HOWEVER ALL SHE SAID WAS AS YOU LIKE SINCE YOU REJECT ME LET THE CROWS HAVE YOU
1053-132821-0014 AND HURRIED AWAY DOWN THE STREET LEFT TO HIMSELF THE FULL HORROR OF HIS COMING DEATH RUSHED UPON THE YOUNG MAN AND HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD THROWN AWAY HIS SOLE CHANCE OF LIFE WELL IF HE MUST HE MUST HE SAID TO HIMSELF
1053-132821-0015 WHO BY THIS TIME COULD SCARCELY BE SEEN EVEN IN THE MOONLIGHT WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED A WOMAN PAST NINETY COULD WALK WITH SUCH SPEED IT SEEMED MORE LIKE FLYING BUT AT LENGTH BREATHLESS AND EXHAUSTED HE REACHED HER SIDE AND GASPED OUT
1053-132821-0016 WE HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE FOLLOW ME AT ONCE
1053-132821-0017 BEFORE HIM THE OLD WOMAN BADE THE PRISONER SWEAR THAT SHE SHOULD BE HIS WIFE AND THIS HE DID IN THE PRESENCE OF WITNESSES THEN BEGGING THE PRIEST AND THE GUARDS TO LEAVE THEM ALONE FOR A LITTLE SHE TOLD THE YOUNG MAN WHAT HE WAS TO DO
1053-132821-0018 WHEN THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE KING AND THE JUDGES THE HALL WAS FULL TO OVERFLOWING WHEN THE PRISONER ENTERED IT AND ALL MARVELLED AT THE BRIGHTNESS OF HIS FACE THE KING INQUIRED IF HE HAD ANY EXCUSE TO PLEAD FOR THE HIGH TREASON HE HAD COMMITTED
1053-132821-0019 BY STRIKING THE HEIR TO THE THRONE AND IF SO TO BE QUICK IN SETTING IT FORTH WITH A LOW BOW THE YOUTH MADE ANSWER IN A CLEAR VOICE O MY LORD AND GRACIOUS KING AND YOU NOBLES AND WISE MEN OF THE LAND
1053-132821-0020 I LEAVE MY CAUSE WITHOUT FEAR IN YOUR HANDS KNOWING THAT YOU WILL LISTEN AND JUDGE RIGHTLY AND THAT YOU WILL SUFFER ME TO SPEAK TO THE END BEFORE YOU GIVE JUDGMENT FOR FOUR YEARS YOU O KING HAD BEEN MARRIED TO THE QUEEN AND YET HAD NO CHILDREN
1053-132821-0021 AND ADOPTED IN SECRET THE BABY OF A POOR QUARRYMAN SENDING A MESSENGER TO TELL YOU THAT YOU HAD A SON NO ONE SUSPECTED THE TRUTH EXCEPT A PRIEST TO WHOM THE QUEEN CONFESSED THE TRUTH AND IN A FEW WEEKS SHE FELL ILL AND DIED
1053-132821-0022 BUT GO ON WITH YOUR STORY ONE DAY SHORTLY AFTER THE DEATH OF THE QUEEN CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN YOUR HIGHNESS WAS HUNTING AND OUTSTRIPPED ALL YOUR ATTENDANTS WHILE CHASING THE DEER YOU WERE IN A PART OF THE COUNTRY WHICH YOU DID NOT KNOW
1053-132821-0023 SO SEEING AN ORCHARD ALL PINK AND WHITE WITH APPLE BLOSSOMS AND A GIRL TOSSING A BALL IN ONE CORNER
1053-132821-0024 BUT WHEN SHE TURNED TO ANSWER YOU YOU WERE SO STRUCK WITH HER BEAUTY THAT ALL ELSE FLED FROM YOUR MIND AGAIN AND AGAIN YOU RODE BACK TO SEE HER AND AT LENGTH PERSUADED HER TO MARRY YOU SHE ONLY THOUGHT YOU A POOR KNIGHT AND AGREED THAT AS YOU WISHED IT
1053-132821-0025 THE MARRIAGE SHOULD BE KEPT SECRET AFTER THE CEREMONY YOU GAVE HER THREE RINGS AND A CHARM WITH A CROSS ON IT AND THEN PUT HER IN A COTTAGE IN THE FOREST THINKING TO HIDE THE MATTER SECURELY FOR SOME MONTHS YOU VISITED THE COTTAGE EVERY WEEK
1053-132821-0026 BUT A REBELLION BROKE OUT IN A DISTANT PART OF THE KINGDOM AND CALLED FOR YOUR PRESENCE WHEN NEXT YOU RODE UP TO THE COTTAGE IT WAS EMPTY AND NONE COULD INFORM YOU WHITHER YOUR BRIDE HAD GONE THAT SIRE I CAN NOW TELL YOU
1053-132821-0027 AND THE YOUNG MAN PAUSED AND LOOKED AT THE KING WHO COLOURED DEEPLY SHE WENT BACK TO HER FATHER THE OLD DUKE ONCE YOUR CHAMBERLAIN AND THE CROSS ON HER BREAST REVEALED AT ONCE WHO YOU WERE FIERCE WAS HIS ANGER WHEN HE HEARD HIS DAUGHTER'S TALE
1053-132821-0028 BY AND BYE I WAS BORN AND WAS BROUGHT UP BY MY GRANDFATHER IN ONE OF HIS GREAT HOUSES HERE ARE THE RINGS YOU GAVE TO MY MOTHER AND HERE IS THE CROSS AND THESE WILL PROVE IF I AM YOUR SON OR NOT
1053-132821-0029 AS HE SPOKE THE YOUNG MAN LAID THE JEWELS AT THE FEET OF THE KING AND THE NOBLES AND THE JUDGES PRESSED ROUND TO EXAMINE THEM THE KING ALONE DID NOT MOVE FROM HIS SEAT FOR HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE HALL OF JUSTICE AND ALL ABOUT HIM
1053-132821-0030 AND SAW ONLY THE APPLE ORCHARD AS IT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO AND THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL PLAYING AT BALL A SUDDEN SILENCE ROUND HIM MADE HIM LOOK UP AND HE FOUND THE EYES OF THE ASSEMBLY FIXED ON HIM IT IS TRUE
1053-132821-0031 IT IS HE WHO IS MY SON AND NOT THE OTHER HE SAID WITH AN EFFORT AND LET EVERY MAN PRESENT SWEAR TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM AS KING AFTER MY DEATH THEREFORE ONE BY ONE THEY ALL KNELT BEFORE HIM AND TOOK THE OATH
1053-132821-0032 AND A MESSAGE WAS SENT TO THE FALSE PRINCE FORBIDDING HIM EVER AGAIN TO APPEAR AT COURT THOUGH A HANDSOME PENSION WAS GRANTED HIM AT LAST THE CEREMONY WAS OVER AND THE KING SIGNING TO HIS NEWLY FOUND SON TO FOLLOW HIM
1053-132821-0033 ROSE AND WENT INTO ANOTHER ROOM TELL ME HOW YOU KNEW ALL THAT HE SAID THROWING HIMSELF INTO A CARVED CHAIR FILLED WITH CRIMSON CUSHIONS AND THE PRINCE TOLD OF HIS MEETING WITH THE OLD WOMAN WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM THE JEWELS FROM HIS MOTHER
1053-132821-0034 AND HOW HE HAD SWORN BEFORE A PRIEST TO MARRY HER THOUGH HE DID NOT WANT TO DO IT ON ACCOUNT OF THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR AGES AND BESIDES HE WOULD RATHER RECEIVE A BRIDE CHOSEN BY THE KING HIMSELF BUT THE KING FROWNED AND ANSWERED SHARPLY
1053-132821-0035 IT TOOK SOME TIME TO DISCOVER THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE OLD WOMAN BUT AT LENGTH IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND WHEN SHE ARRIVED AT THE PALACE WITH THE EQUERRY SHE WAS RECEIVED WITH ROYAL HONOURS AS BECAME THE BRIDE OF THE PRINCE
1053-132821-0036 BUT THEY WERE MORE AMAZED STILL AT THE LIGHTNESS OF HER STEP AS SHE SKIPPED UP THE STEPS TO THE GREAT DOOR BEFORE WHICH THE KING WAS STANDING WITH THE PRINCE AT HIS SIDE IF THEY BOTH FELT A SHOCK AT THE APPEARANCE OF THE AGED LADY THEY DID NOT SHOW IT
1053-132821-0037 AND THE KING WITH A GRAVE BOW TOOK HER BAND AND LED HER TO THE CHAPEL WHERE A BISHOP WAS WAITING TO PERFORM THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY
1053-132821-0038 FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS LITTLE WAS SEEN OF THE PRINCE WHO SPENT ALL HIS DAYS IN HUNTING AND TRYING TO FORGET THE OLD WIFE AT HOME AS FOR THE PRINCESS NO ONE TROUBLED HIMSELF ABOUT HER AND SHE PASSED THE DAYS ALONE IN HER APARTMENTS
1053-132821-0039 CREEPING SOFTLY TO THE DOOR HE PEEPED THROUGH IT AND BEHELD HER LYING QUIETLY WITH A CROWN OF GOLD AND PEARLS UPON HER HEAD HER WRINKLES ALL GONE AND HER FACE WHICH WAS WHITER THAN THE SNOW AS FRESH AS THAT OF A GIRL OF FOURTEEN
1053-132821-0040 COULD THAT REALLY BE HIS WIFE THAT BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL CREATURE THE PRINCE WAS STILL GAZING IN SURPRISE WHEN THE LADY OPENED HER EYES AND SMILED AT HIM YES I REALLY AM YOUR WIFE SHE SAID AS IF SHE HAD GUESSED HIS THOUGHTS
1053-132821-0041 THE KING OF GRANADA IS MY FATHER AND I WAS BORN IN THE PALACE WHICH OVERLOOKS THE PLAIN OF THE VEGA I WAS ONLY A FEW MONTHS OLD WHEN A WICKED FAIRY WHO HAD A SPITE AGAINST MY PARENTS CAST A SPELL OVER ME
1053-132821-0042 BENDING MY BACK AND WRINKLING MY SKIN TILL I LOOKED AS IF I WAS A HUNDRED YEARS OLD AND MAKING ME SUCH AN OBJECT OF DISGUST TO EVERYONE
1053-132821-0043 SHE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO CARED ABOUT ME AND WE LIVED TOGETHER IN THIS CITY ON A SMALL PENSION ALLOWED ME BY THE KING WHEN I WAS ABOUT THREE AN OLD MAN ARRIVED AT OUR HOUSE AND BEGGED MY NURSE TO LET HIM COME IN AND REST AS HE COULD WALK NO LONGER
1053-132821-0044 SHE SAW THAT HE WAS VERY ILL SO PUT HIM TO BED AND TOOK SUCH CARE OF HIM THAT BY AND BYE HE WAS AS STRONG AS EVER IN GRATITUDE FOR HER GOODNESS TO HIM HE TOLD HER THAT HE WAS A WIZARD
1053-132821-0045 TO THIS HE REPLIED THAT AS MY MISFORTUNE RESULTED FROM A SPELL THIS WAS RATHER DIFFICULT BUT HE WOULD DO HIS BEST AND AT ANY RATE HE COULD PROMISE THAT BEFORE MY FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY
1053-132821-0046 AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE THIS WAS NOT EASY AS MY UGLINESS WAS SUCH THAT NO ONE WOULD LOOK AT ME A SECOND TIME MY NURSE AND I WERE ALMOST IN DESPAIR AS MY FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY WAS DRAWING NEAR AND I HAD NEVER SO MUCH AS SPOKEN TO A MAN
1053-132821-0047 AT LAST WE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM THE WIZARD WHO TOLD US WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT COURT AND YOUR STORY BIDDING ME TO PUT MYSELF IN YOUR WAY WHEN YOU HAD LOST ALL HOPE AND OFFER TO SAVE YOU IF YOU WOULD CONSENT TO MARRY ME
