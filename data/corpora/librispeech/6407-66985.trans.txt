6407-66985-0000 I WRITE THIS ACCOUNT OF THE MODE OF MY BEING TRANSFERRED HERE SIMPLY THAT IT SHOULD BE REALISED HOW HARD IT HAS BEEN FOR ME TO GET ANYTHING OUT OF MY PUNISHMENT BUT BITTERNESS AND DESPAIR I HAVE HOWEVER TO DO IT
6407-66985-0001 AND NOW AND THEN I HAVE MOMENTS OF SUBMISSION AND ACCEPTANCE ALL THE SPRING MAY BE HIDDEN IN THE SINGLE BUD AND THE LOW GROUND NEST OF THE LARK MAY HOLD THE JOY THAT IS TO HERALD THE FEET OF MANY ROSE RED DAWNS
6407-66985-0002 SO PERHAPS WHATEVER BEAUTY OF LIFE STILL REMAINS TO ME IS CONTAINED IN SOME MOMENT OF SURRENDER ABASEMENT AND HUMILIATION I CAN AT ANY RATE MERELY PROCEED ON THE LINES OF MY OWN DEVELOPMENT
6407-66985-0003 AND ACCEPTING ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME MAKE MYSELF WORTHY OF IT PEOPLE USED TO SAY OF ME THAT I WAS TOO INDIVIDUALISTIC I MUST BE FAR MORE OF AN INDIVIDUALIST THAN EVER I WAS
6407-66985-0004 I MUST GET FAR MORE OUT OF MYSELF THAN EVER I GOT AND ASK FAR LESS OF THE WORLD THAN EVER I ASKED INDEED MY RUIN CAME NOT FROM TOO GREAT INDIVIDUALISM OF LIFE BUT FROM TOO LITTLE THE ONE DISGRACEFUL
6407-66985-0005 UNPARDONABLE AND TO ALL TIME CONTEMPTIBLE ACTION OF MY LIFE WAS TO ALLOW MYSELF TO APPEAL TO SOCIETY FOR HELP AND PROTECTION TO HAVE MADE SUCH AN APPEAL WOULD HAVE BEEN FROM THE INDIVIDUALIST POINT OF VIEW BAD ENOUGH
6407-66985-0006 BUT WHAT EXCUSE CAN THERE EVER BE PUT FORWARD FOR HAVING MADE IT OF COURSE ONCE I HAD PUT INTO MOTION THE FORCES OF SOCIETY SOCIETY TURNED ON ME AND SAID HAVE YOU BEEN LIVING ALL THIS TIME IN DEFIANCE OF MY LAWS
6407-66985-0007 AND DO YOU NOW APPEAL TO THOSE LAWS FOR PROTECTION YOU SHALL HAVE THOSE LAWS EXERCISED TO THE FULL YOU SHALL ABIDE BY WHAT YOU HAVE APPEALED TO
6407-66985-0008 KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ART AND ARE THE VERY SALT OF THE EARTH HE IS THE PHILISTINE WHO UPHOLDS AND AIDS THE HEAVY CUMBROUS BLIND MECHANICAL FORCES OF SOCIETY AND WHO DOES NOT RECOGNISE DYNAMIC FORCE WHEN HE MEETS IT
6407-66985-0009 EITHER IN A MAN OR A MOVEMENT PEOPLE THOUGHT IT DREADFUL OF ME TO HAVE ENTERTAINED AT DINNER THE EVIL THINGS OF LIFE AND TO HAVE FOUND PLEASURE IN THEIR COMPANY BUT THEN FROM THE POINT OF VIEW THROUGH WHICH I AS AN ARTIST IN LIFE APPROACH THEM
6407-66985-0010 THEY WERE DELIGHTFULLY SUGGESTIVE AND STIMULATING THE DANGER WAS HALF THE EXCITEMENT MY BUSINESS AS AN ARTIST WAS WITH ARIEL I SET MYSELF TO WRESTLE WITH CALIBAN A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE
6407-66985-0011 A FRIEND OF TEN YEARS STANDING CAME TO SEE ME SOME TIME AGO AND TOLD ME THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE A SINGLE WORD OF WHAT WAS SAID AGAINST ME AND WISHED ME TO KNOW THAT HE CONSIDERED ME QUITE INNOCENT AND THE VICTIM OF A HIDEOUS PLOT
6407-66985-0012 STILL THAT MY LIFE HAD BEEN FULL OF PERVERSE PLEASURES AND THAT UNLESS HE ACCEPTED THAT AS A FACT ABOUT ME AND REALISED IT TO THE FULL I COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE FRIENDS WITH HIM ANY MORE OR EVER BE IN HIS COMPANY IT WAS A TERRIBLE SHOCK TO HIM
6407-66985-0013 BUT WE ARE FRIENDS AND I HAVE NOT GOT HIS FRIENDSHIP ON FALSE PRETENCES EMOTIONAL FORCES AS I SAY SOMEWHERE IN INTENTIONS ARE AS LIMITED IN EXTENT AND DURATION AS THE FORCES OF PHYSICAL ENERGY
6407-66985-0014 THE LITTLE CUP THAT IS MADE TO HOLD SO MUCH CAN HOLD SO MUCH AND NO MORE THOUGH ALL THE PURPLE VATS OF BURGUNDY BE FILLED WITH WINE TO THE BRIM AND THE TREADERS STAND KNEE DEEP IN THE GATHERED GRAPES OF THE STONY VINEYARDS OF SPAIN
6407-66985-0015 THERE IS NO ERROR MORE COMMON THAN THAT OF THINKING THAT THOSE WHO ARE THE CAUSES OR OCCASIONS OF GREAT TRAGEDIES SHARE IN THE FEELINGS SUITABLE TO THE TRAGIC MOOD NO ERROR MORE FATAL THAN EXPECTING IT OF THEM
6407-66985-0016 OR THE FELLING OF A TREE TO THE CHARCOAL BURNER IN THE FOREST OR THE FALL OF A FLOWER TO ONE WHO IS MOWING DOWN THE GRASS WITH A SCYTHE GREAT PASSIONS ARE FOR THE GREAT OF SOUL AND GREAT EVENTS
6407-66985-0017 CAN BE SEEN ONLY BY THOSE WHO ARE ON A LEVEL WITH THEM I KNOW OF NOTHING IN ALL DRAMA MORE INCOMPARABLE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ART NOTHING MORE SUGGESTIVE IN ITS SUBTLETY OF OBSERVATION
6407-66985-0018 HE IS STAGGERING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF A BURDEN INTOLERABLE TO ONE OF HIS TEMPERAMENT THE DEAD HAVE COME ARMED OUT OF THE GRAVE TO IMPOSE ON HIM A MISSION AT ONCE TOO GREAT AND TOO MEAN FOR HIM HE IS A DREAMER
6407-66985-0019 WITH LIFE IN ITS PRACTICAL REALISATION OF WHICH HE KNOWS NOTHING NOT WITH LIFE IN ITS IDEAL ESSENCE OF WHICH HE KNOWS SO MUCH HE HAS NO CONCEPTION OF WHAT TO DO AND HIS FOLLY IS TO FEIGN FOLLY
6407-66985-0020 BRUTUS USED MADNESS AS A CLOAK TO CONCEAL THE SWORD OF HIS PURPOSE THE DAGGER OF HIS WILL BUT THE HAMLET MADNESS IS A MERE MASK FOR THE HIDING OF WEAKNESS IN THE MAKING OF FANCIES AND JESTS HE SEES A CHANCE OF DELAY
6407-66985-0021 HE KEEPS PLAYING WITH ACTION AS AN ARTIST PLAYS WITH A THEORY HE MAKES HIMSELF THE SPY OF HIS PROPER ACTIONS AND LISTENING TO HIS OWN WORDS KNOWS THEM TO BE BUT WORDS WORDS WORDS INSTEAD OF TRYING TO BE THE HERO OF HIS OWN HISTORY
6407-66985-0022 HE SEEKS TO BE THE SPECTATOR OF HIS OWN TRAGEDY HE DISBELIEVES IN EVERYTHING INCLUDING HIMSELF AND YET HIS DOUBT HELPS HIM NOT AS IT COMES NOT FROM SCEPTICISM BUT FROM A DIVIDED WILL
6407-66985-0023 AND THE PUPPETS IN THEIR DALLIANCE HAMLET CATCHES THE CONSCIENCE OF THE KING AND DRIVES THE WRETCHED MAN IN TERROR FROM HIS THRONE GUILDENSTERN AND ROSENCRANTZ SEE NO MORE IN HIS CONDUCT THAN A RATHER PAINFUL BREACH OF COURT ETIQUETTE
6407-66985-0024 THAT IS AS FAR AS THEY CAN ATTAIN TO IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE SPECTACLE OF LIFE WITH APPROPRIATE EMOTIONS THEY ARE CLOSE TO HIS VERY SECRET AND KNOW NOTHING OF IT NOR WOULD THERE BE ANY USE IN TELLING THEM
6407-66985-0025 BUT A TRAGIC ENDING OF THIS KIND THOUGH TOUCHED BY HAMLET'S HUMOUR WITH SOMETHING OF THE SURPRISE AND JUSTICE OF COMEDY IS REALLY NOT FOR SUCH AS THEY THEY NEVER DIE HORATIO
6407-66985-0026 WHO IN ORDER TO REPORT HAMLET AND HIS CAUSE ARIGHT TO THE UNSATISFIED ABSENTS HIM FROM FELICITY A WHILE AND IN THIS HARSH WORLD DRAWS HIS BREATH IN PAIN DIES
6407-66985-0027 BUT GUILDENSTERN AND ROSENCRANTZ ARE AS IMMORTAL AS ANGELO AND TARTUFFE AND SHOULD RANK WITH THEM THEY ARE WHAT MODERN LIFE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE ANTIQUE IDEAL OF FRIENDSHIP HE WHO WRITES A NEW
6407-66985-0028 MUST FIND A NICHE FOR THEM AND PRAISE THEM IN TUSCULAN PROSE THEY ARE TYPES FIXED FOR ALL TIME TO CENSURE THEM WOULD SHOW A LACK OF APPRECIATION THEY ARE MERELY OUT OF THEIR SPHERE THAT IS ALL
6407-66985-0029 IN SUBLIMITY OF SOUL THERE IS NO CONTAGION HIGH THOUGHTS AND HIGH EMOTIONS ARE BY THEIR VERY EXISTENCE ISOLATED I AM TO BE RELEASED IF ALL GOES WELL WITH ME TOWARDS THE END OF MAY
6407-66985-0030 AND HOPE TO GO AT ONCE TO SOME LITTLE SEA SIDE VILLAGE ABROAD WITH R AND M
6407-66985-0031 WASHES AWAY THE STAINS AND WOUNDS OF THE WORLD I HOPE TO BE AT LEAST A MONTH WITH MY FRIENDS AND TO GAIN PEACE AND BALANCE AND A LESS TROUBLED HEART AND A SWEETER MOOD
6407-66985-0032 I HAVE A STRANGE LONGING FOR THE GREAT SIMPLE PRIMEVAL THINGS SUCH AS THE SEA TO ME NO LESS OF A MOTHER THAN THE EARTH IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE ALL LOOK AT NATURE TOO MUCH AND LIVE WITH HER TOO LITTLE
6407-66985-0033 I DISCERN GREAT SANITY IN THE GREEK ATTITUDE THEY NEVER CHATTERED ABOUT SUNSETS OR DISCUSSED WHETHER THE SHADOWS ON THE GRASS WERE REALLY MAUVE OR NOT BUT THEY SAW THAT THE SEA WAS FOR THE SWIMMER AND THE SAND FOR THE FEET OF THE RUNNER
6407-66985-0034 THEY LOVED THE TREES FOR THE SHADOW THAT THEY CAST AND THE FOREST FOR ITS SILENCE AT NOON THE VINEYARD DRESSER WREATHED HIS HAIR WITH IVY THAT HE MIGHT KEEP OFF THE RAYS OF THE SUN AS HE STOOPED OVER THE YOUNG SHOOTS
6407-66985-0035 THEY PLAITED WITH GARLANDS THE LEAVES OF THE BITTER LAUREL AND OF THE WILD PARSLEY WHICH ELSE HAD BEEN OF NO SERVICE TO MEN
6407-66985-0036 AND WE DO NOT KNOW THE USES OF ANY SINGLE THING WE HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT WATER CAN CLEANSE AND FIRE PURIFY AND THAT THE EARTH IS MOTHER TO US ALL AS A CONSEQUENCE OUR ART IS OF THE MOON AND PLAYS WITH SHADOWS WHILE GREEK ART IS OF THE SUN
6407-66985-0037 AND DEALS DIRECTLY WITH THINGS I FEEL SURE THAT IN ELEMENTAL FORCES THERE IS PURIFICATION AND I WANT TO GO BACK TO THEM
6407-66985-0038 OF COURSE TO ONE SO MODERN AS I AM
6407-66985-0039 WILL BE ALWAYS LOVELY I TREMBLE WITH PLEASURE WHEN I THINK THAT ON THE VERY DAY OF MY LEAVING PRISON BOTH THE LABURNUM AND THE LILAC WILL BE BLOOMING IN THE GARDENS AND THAT I SHALL SEE THE WIND STIR INTO RESTLESS BEAUTY THE SWAYING GOLD OF THE ONE
6407-66985-0040 AND MAKE THE OTHER TOSS THE PALE PURPLE OF ITS PLUMES SO THAT ALL THE AIR SHALL BE ARABIA FOR ME LINNAEUS FELL ON HIS KNEES AND WEPT FOR JOY WHEN HE SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME THE LONG HEATH OF SOME ENGLISH UPLAND
6407-66985-0041 MADE YELLOW WITH THE TAWNY AROMATIC BROOMS OF THE COMMON FURZE
6407-66985-0042 SATISFYING THOUGH IT MAY BE THERE IS SOME SPIRIT HIDDEN OF WHICH THE PAINTED FORMS AND SHAPES ARE BUT MODES OF MANIFESTATION AND IT IS WITH THIS SPIRIT THAT I DESIRE TO BECOME IN HARMONY
6407-66985-0043 I HAVE GROWN TIRED OF THE ARTICULATE UTTERANCES OF MEN AND THINGS THE MYSTICAL IN ART THE MYSTICAL IN LIFE THE MYSTICAL IN NATURE THIS IS WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR ME TO FIND IT SOMEWHERE
6407-66985-0044 ALL TRIALS ARE TRIALS FOR ONE'S LIFE JUST AS ALL SENTENCES ARE SENTENCES OF DEATH AND THREE TIMES HAVE I BEEN TRIED THE FIRST TIME I LEFT THE BOX TO BE ARRESTED
6407-66985-0045 THE SECOND TIME TO BE LED BACK TO THE HOUSE OF DETENTION THE THIRD TIME TO PASS INTO A PRISON FOR TWO YEARS SOCIETY AS WE HAVE CONSTITUTED IT WILL HAVE NO PLACE FOR ME HAS NONE TO OFFER
6407-66985-0046 BUT NATURE WHOSE SWEET RAINS FALL ON UNJUST AND JUST ALIKE WILL HAVE CLEFTS IN THE ROCKS WHERE I MAY HIDE AND SECRET VALLEYS IN WHOSE SILENCE I MAY WEEP UNDISTURBED SHE WILL HANG THE NIGHT WITH STARS
6407-66985-0047 SO THAT I MAY WALK ABROAD IN THE DARKNESS WITHOUT STUMBLING AND SEND THE WIND OVER MY FOOTPRINTS
6407-66985-0048 SHE WILL CLEANSE ME IN GREAT WATERS
