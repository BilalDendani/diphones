6754-107485-0000 NOW THAT IT IS ALL OVER I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER SHE WAS REALLY WORN OUT
6754-107485-0001 AT ANY RATE ONE MORNING IN MID AUGUST WHEN THE NEWPORT SEASON WAS IN FULL FEATHER
6754-107485-0002 I JUST CAN'T STAND IT FOR ANOTHER MINUTE BUNNY SHE FALTERED REAL TEARS COURSING DOWN HER CHEEKS I HAVEN'T SLEPT A WINK OF NATURAL SLEEP FOR FIVE DAYS AND YET WHEN NIGHT COMES IT IS ALL I CAN DO TO KEEP MY EYES OPEN
6754-107485-0003 AT THE ROCKERBILT BALL LAST NIGHT I DOZED OFF FOUR TIMES WHILE TALKING WITH THE DUCHESS OF SNARLEYOW AND WHEN THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR ASKED ME TO SIT OUT THE GAVOTTE WITH HIM I'M TOLD I ACTUALLY SNORED IN HIS FACE A WOMAN WHO CAN'T KEEP AWAKE ALL NIGHT AND SLEEP PROPERLY BY DAY IS NOT FIT FOR NEWPORT SOCIETY
6754-107485-0004 THERE IS NO USE OF TRYING TO DO TOO MUCH AND YOU HAVE BEGUN TO SHOW THE STRAIN TO WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN SUBJECTING YOURSELF YOUR FAILURE LAST FRIDAY NIGHT TO LAND MISSUS GOLLET'S RUBY DOG COLLAR

6754-107485-0006 SO THAT YOU COULD HAVE A WEEK OF ABSOLUTE TRANQUILLITY IT MUST BE AWFUL FOR A MAN OF YOUR REFINED SENSIBILITIES TO HAVE TO ASSOCIATE SO CONSTANTLY WITH THE HOUSEMAIDS THE UNDER BUTLERS AND THE FOOTMEN NOTHING WOULD PLEASE ME BETTER
6754-107485-0007 FOR TO TELL THE TRUTH SOCIETY BELOW STAIRS WAS RAPIDLY BECOMING CAVIAR TO MY TASTE THE HOUSEMAIDS WERE ALL RIGHT
6754-107485-0008 I COULD WITHER WHEN THEY GREW TOO FAMILIAR BUT THE FOOTMEN WERE INTOLERABLE GUYERS ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION THEIR QUICK IRISH WIT HAD PUT ME TO MY TRUMPS TO MAINTAIN MY DIGNITY AND I HAD NOTICED OF LATE THAT THEIR ALLEGED FUN AT MY EXPENSE HAD MADE EVEN THE PARLORMAID GIGGLE IN A MOST IRRITATING FASHION
6754-107485-0009 THE CONSTANT SCRAPPES HAVE A VERY EXCELLENT LIBRARY AND A LINE OF READING IN ABSTRACT MORALS IN FULL CALF THAT I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO GET AT SO BE IT THEN SAID HENRIETTE WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF I WILL TAKE MY DEPARTURE NEXT SATURDAY AFTER THE INNITT'S CLAM BAKE ON HONK ISLAND
6754-107485-0010 I LIVED FOR MONTHS ON THE CHAFING DISH BEFORE I FOUND YOU AGAIN
6754-107485-0011 AND SO THE MATTER WAS ARRANGED THE SERVANTS WERE NOTIFIED THAT OWING TO MISSUS VAN RAFFLES'S ILLNESS THEY MIGHT TAKE A VACATION ON FULL PAY FOR TEN DAYS AND HENRIETTE HERSELF PREPARED SOCIETY FOR HER DEPARTURE BY FAINTING TWICE AT THE INNIT'S CLAM BAKE ON HONK ISLAND
6754-107485-0012 NO LESS A PERSON THAN MISSUS GASTER HERSELF BROUGHT HER HOME AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
6754-107485-0013 FOR ALL OUR SAKES SATURDAY MORNING HENRIETTE DEPARTED SATURDAY AFTERNOON THE SERVANTS FOLLOWED SUIT
6754-107485-0014 AND OH HOW I REVELLED IN IT THE BEAUTIES OF BOLIVAR LODGE HAD NEVER SO REVEALED THEMSELVES TO ME AS THEN THE HOUSE AS DARK AS THE TOMB WITHOUT
6754-107485-0015 BUT A BLAZE OF LIGHT WITHIN FROM CELLAR TO ROOF
6754-107485-0016 A MARVELLOUS COLLECTION THOUGH FOR THE MOST PART WHOLLY UNCUT EVERYTHING MOVED ALONG SERENELY UNTIL WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON WHEN I THOUGHT I HEARD A NOISE IN THE CELLAR
6754-107485-0017 TRUE I DID NOT GO DOWN TO SEE IF ANY ONE WERE THERE
6754-107485-0018 WHERE I HAD LEFT OFF AT THE MOMENT OF THE INTERRUPTION THAT EVENING I COOKED MYSELF A WELSH RABBIT
6754-107485-0019 A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE AND A BOX OF VENCEDORAS PREPARED FOR A QUIET EVENING OF ABSOLUTE LUXURY I READ IN THE WANING LIGHT OF THE DYING MIDSUMMER DAY FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN AS DARKNESS CAME ON
6754-107485-0020 THE LAMP WOULD NOT LIGHT I PRESSED AND PRESSED EVERY BUTTON IN THE ROOM BUT WITH NO BETTER RESULTS AND THEN GOING THROUGH THE HOUSE I TRIED EVERY OTHER BUTTON I COULD FIND BUT EVERYWHERE CONDITIONS WERE THE SAME
6754-107485-0021 I REALIZED THAT AFTER ALL NOTHING COULD BE PLEASANTER THAN TO SIT IN THE MOONLIGHT AND SMOKE AND QUAFF BUMPERS OF CHAMPAGNE UNTIL THE CRACK OF DOOM
6754-107485-0022 AND KEPT AT IT PRETTY STEADILY UNTIL I SHOULD SAY ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN I HEARD UNMISTAKABLE SIGNS OF A LARGE AUTOMOBILE COMING UP THE DRIVE
6754-107485-0023 AND THEN STOOD PANTING LIKE AN IMPATIENT STEAM ENGINE WHILE THE CHAUFFEUR A PERSON OF MEDIUM HEIGHT WELL MUFFLED IN HIS AUTOMOBILE COAT HIS FEATURES CONCEALED BEHIND HIS GOGGLES AND HIS MOUTH COVERED BY HIS COLLAR RAPPED LOUDLY ON THE FRONT DOOR ONCE THEN A SECOND TIME
6754-107485-0024 IF I SOUGHT THE NAME I WAS NOT TO BE GRATIFIED
