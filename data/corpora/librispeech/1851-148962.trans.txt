1851-148962-0000 AS USUAL HE ATE AND DRANK MUCH AND EAGERLY BUT THOSE WHO KNEW HIM INTIMATELY NOTICED THAT SOME GREAT CHANGE HAD COME OVER HIM THAT DAY HE WAS SILENT ALL THROUGH DINNER AND LOOKED ABOUT BLINKING AND SCOWLING
1851-148962-0001 THE UNSOLVED PROBLEM THAT TORMENTED HIM WAS CAUSED BY HINTS GIVEN BY THE PRINCESS HIS COUSIN AT MOSCOW CONCERNING DOLOKHOV'S INTIMACY WITH HIS WIFE AND BY AN ANONYMOUS LETTER HE HAD RECEIVED THAT MORNING
1851-148962-0002 WHICH IN THE MEAN JOCULAR WAY COMMON TO ANONYMOUS LETTERS SAID THAT HE SAW BADLY THROUGH HIS SPECTACLES BUT THAT HIS WIFE'S CONNECTION WITH DOLOKHOV WAS A SECRET TO NO ONE BUT HIMSELF
1851-148962-0003 BUT HE FEARED NOW TO LOOK AT DOLOKHOV WHO WAS SITTING OPPOSITE HIM EVERY TIME HE CHANCED TO MEET DOLOKHOV'S HANDSOME INSOLENT EYES PIERRE FELT SOMETHING TERRIBLE AND MONSTROUS RISING IN HIS SOUL AND TURNED QUICKLY AWAY
1851-148962-0004 HE INVOLUNTARILY REMEMBERED HOW DOLOKHOV WHO HAD FULLY RECOVERED HIS FORMER POSITION AFTER THE CAMPAIGN HAD RETURNED TO PETERSBURG AND COME TO HIM AVAILING HIMSELF OF HIS FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH PIERRE AS A BOON COMPANION
1851-148962-0005 AND PIERRE HAD PUT HIM UP AND LENT HIM MONEY PIERRE RECALLED HOW HELENE HAD SMILINGLY EXPRESSED DISAPPROVAL OF DOLOKHOV'S LIVING AT THEIR HOUSE AND HOW CYNICALLY DOLOKHOV HAD PRAISED HIS WIFE'S BEAUTY TO HIM AND FROM THAT TIME TILL THEY CAME TO MOSCOW
1851-148962-0006 BEFRIENDED HIM AND HELPED HIM I KNOW AND UNDERSTAND WHAT A SPICE THAT WOULD ADD TO THE PLEASURE OF DECEIVING ME IF IT REALLY WERE TRUE YES IF IT WERE TRUE BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO AND CAN'T BELIEVE IT
1851-148962-0007 HE REMEMBERED THE EXPRESSION DOLOKHOV'S FACE ASSUMED IN HIS MOMENTS OF CRUELTY AS WHEN TYING THE POLICEMAN TO THE BEAR AND DROPPING THEM INTO THE WATER OR WHEN HE CHALLENGED A MAN TO A DUEL WITHOUT ANY REASON
1851-148962-0008 AND THAT MUST PLEASE HIM HE MUST THINK THAT I TOO AM AFRAID OF HIM AND IN FACT I AM AFRAID OF HIM HE THOUGHT AND AGAIN HE FELT SOMETHING TERRIBLE AND MONSTROUS RISING IN HIS SOUL
1851-148962-0009 DOLOKHOV DENISOV AND ROSTOV WERE NOW SITTING OPPOSITE PIERRE AND SEEMED VERY GAY ROSTOV WAS TALKING MERRILY TO HIS TWO FRIENDS ONE OF WHOM WAS A DASHING HUSSAR AND THE OTHER A NOTORIOUS DUELIST AND RAKE
