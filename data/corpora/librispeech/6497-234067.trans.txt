6497-234067-0000 MISTER HOSKIN A YOUNG PAINTER WHOSE PICTURES WERE SOMETIMES REJECTED IN THE ACADEMY BUT WHO WAS A LITTLE LION IN THE MINOR EXHIBITIONS CAME ONCE A WEEK TO GIVE HER LESSONS AND WHEN SHE WENT TO TOWN SHE CALLED AT HIS STUDIO WITH HER SKETCHES
6497-234067-0001 HE WAS A GOOD LOOKING BLOND MAN SOMEWHAT INCLINED TO THE POETICAL AND MELANCHOLY TYPE HIS HAIR BRISTLED AND HE WORE A CLOSE CUT RED BEARD THE MOUSTACHE WAS LONG AND SILKY
6497-234067-0002 THERE WAS A GENTLE PATHETIC LOOK IN HIS PALE BLUE EYES AND A SLIGHT HESITATION OF SPEECH AN INABILITY TO EXPRESS HIMSELF IN WORDS CREATED A PASSING IMPRESSION OF A RATHER FOOLISH TIRESOME PERSON
6497-234067-0003 AND HE LIVED PRINCIPALLY BY TEACHING BUT HE HAD NOT GIVEN MILDRED HER FOURTH LESSON IN LANDSCAPE PAINTING WHEN HE RECEIVED AN ADVANTAGEOUS OFFER TO COPY TWO PICTURES BY TURNER IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY
6497-234067-0004 SHE LISTENED TO HIM HER EYES WIDE OPEN AND THEN IN HER LITTLE ALLUSIVE WAY SUGGESTED THAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO COPY SOMETHING SHE MIGHT AS WELL TAKE HER LESSON IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY AS IN SUTTON BESIDES
6497-234067-0005 HE WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE HER ROUND THE GALLERY AND EXPLAIN THE MERITS OF THE PICTURES SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO GET AWAY FROM SUTTON AND THE PROSPECT OF LONG DAYS SPENT IN LONDON PLEASED HER
6497-234067-0006 AND ON THE FOLLOWING THURSDAY HAROLD TOOK HER UP TO LONDON BY THE TEN MINUTES PAST NINE FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE FOUND SOMETHING ROMANTIC IN THAT TRAIN THEY DROVE FROM VICTORIA IN A HANSOM

6497-234067-0008 STOPPING BEFORE THE CROWD OF EASELS THE PAINT BOXES THE PALETTES ON THE THUMBS THE SHEAVES OF BRUSHES THE MAULSTICKS IN THE AIR SHE GLANCED AT THE WORK SEEKING EAGERLY FOR COPIES WORSE THAN ANY SHE WAS LIKELY TO PERPETRATE
6497-234067-0009 AND SHE EXPERIENCED A LITTLE THRILL WHEN HE LED HER TO THE EASEL A BEAUTIFUL WHITE CANVAS STOOD ON IT READY FOR HER TO BEGIN AND ON A CHAIR BY THE SIDE OF THE EASEL WAS HER PAINT BOX AND BRUSHES HE TOLD HER WHERE SHE WOULD FIND HIM
6497-234067-0010 IN THE TURNER ROOM AND THAT SHE MUST NOT HESITATE TO COME AND FETCH HIM WHENEVER SHE WAS IN DIFFICULTIES I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO SEE THE DRAWING SHE SAID BEFORE I BEGIN TO PAINT
