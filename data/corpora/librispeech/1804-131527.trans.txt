1804-131527-0000 WITH A TABLE BESIDE IT COVERED WITH ROLLS OF CANVAS BOTTLES OF OIL AND VARNISH
1804-131527-0001 AND A FEW FINISHED PAINTINGS MOSTLY OF LANDSCAPES AND FIGURES I MUST MAKE YOU WELCOME TO MY STUDIO SAID MISSUS GRAHAM
1804-131527-0002 AND DISENGAGING A COUPLE OF CHAIRS FROM THE ARTISTICAL LUMBER THAT USURPED THEM SHE BID US BE SEATED AND RESUMED HER PLACE BESIDE THE EASEL NOT FACING IT EXACTLY BUT NOW AND THEN GLANCING AT THE PICTURE UPON IT WHILE SHE CONVERSED
1804-131527-0003 AND GIVING IT AN OCCASIONAL TOUCH WITH HER BRUSH AS IF SHE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WEAN HER ATTENTION ENTIRELY FROM HER OCCUPATION TO FIX IT UPON HER GUESTS IT WAS A VIEW OF WILDFELL HALL AS SEEN AT EARLY MORNING FROM THE FIELD BELOW
1804-131527-0004 RISING IN DARK RELIEF AGAINST A SKY OF CLEAR SILVERY BLUE WITH A FEW RED STREAKS ON THE HORIZON FAITHFULLY DRAWN AND COLOURED AND VERY ELEGANTLY AND ARTISTICALLY HANDLED I SEE YOUR HEART IS IN YOUR WORK MISSUS GRAHAM OBSERVED I
1804-131527-0005 FOR IF YOU SUFFER OUR PRESENCE TO INTERRUPT YOU WE SHALL BE CONSTRAINED TO REGARD OURSELVES AS UNWELCOME INTRUDERS OH NO REPLIED SHE THROWING HER BRUSH ON TO THE TABLE AS IF STARTLED INTO POLITENESS
1804-131527-0006 YOU HAVE ALMOST COMPLETED YOUR PAINTING SAID I APPROACHING TO OBSERVE IT MORE CLOSELY AND SURVEYING IT WITH A GREATER DEGREE OF ADMIRATION AND DELIGHT THAN I CARED TO EXPRESS
1804-131527-0007 A FEW MORE TOUCHES IN THE FOREGROUND WILL FINISH IT I SHOULD THINK BUT WHY HAVE YOU CALLED IT FERNLEY MANOR CUMBERLAND INSTEAD OF WILDFELL HALL SHIRE I ASKED ALLUDING TO THE NAME SHE HAD TRACED IN SMALL CHARACTERS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CANVAS
1804-131527-0008 BUT IMMEDIATELY I WAS SENSIBLE OF HAVING COMMITTED AN ACT OF IMPERTINENCE IN SO DOING FOR SHE COLOURED AND HESITATED BUT AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE WITH A KIND OF DESPERATE FRANKNESS SHE REPLIED BECAUSE I HAVE FRIENDS
1804-131527-0009 ACQUAINTANCES AT LEAST IN THE WORLD FROM WHOM I DESIRE MY PRESENT ABODE TO BE CONCEALED AND AS THEY MIGHT SEE THE PICTURE AND MIGHT POSSIBLY RECOGNISE THE STYLE IN SPITE OF THE FALSE INITIALS I HAVE PUT IN THE CORNER
1804-131527-0010 THEN YOU DON'T INTEND TO KEEP THE PICTURE SAID I ANXIOUS TO SAY ANYTHING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT NO
1804-131527-0011 MAMMA SENDS ALL HER PICTURES TO LONDON SAID ARTHUR AND SOMEBODY SELLS THEM FOR HER THERE AND SENDS US THE MONEY IN LOOKING ROUND UPON THE OTHER PIECES I REMARKED A PRETTY SKETCH OF LINDEN HOPE FROM THE TOP OF THE HILL
1804-131527-0012 ANOTHER VIEW OF THE OLD HALL BASKING IN THE SUNNY HAZE OF A QUIET SUMMER AFTERNOON AND A SIMPLE BUT STRIKING LITTLE PICTURE OF A CHILD BROODING WITH LOOKS OF SILENT BUT DEEP AND SORROWFUL REGRET
1804-131527-0013 AND A DULL BECLOUDED SKY ABOVE YOU SEE THERE IS A SAD DEARTH OF SUBJECTS OBSERVED THE FAIR ARTIST I TOOK THE OLD HALL ONCE ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT AND I SUPPOSE I MUST TAKE IT AGAIN ON A SNOWY WINTER'S DAY
1804-131527-0014 AND THEN AGAIN ON A DARK CLOUDY EVENING FOR I REALLY HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO PAINT
1804-131527-0015 OR NEARLY SO LITTLE SHORT OF EIGHT MILES THERE AND BACK AND OVER A SOMEWHAT ROUGH FATIGUING ROAD IN WHAT DIRECTION DOES IT LIE
1804-131527-0016 IT'S MAMMA'S FRIEND SAID ARTHUR ROSE AND I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
1804-131527-0017 WHISPERED ROSE THE CHILD LOOKED AT HER IN GRAVE SURPRISE SHE STRAIGHTWAY BEGAN TO TALK TO HIM ON INDIFFERENT MATTERS WHILE I AMUSED MYSELF WITH LOOKING AT THE PICTURES THERE WAS ONE IN AN OBSCURE CORNER THAT I HAD NOT BEFORE OBSERVED
1804-131527-0018 IT WAS A LITTLE CHILD SEATED ON THE GRASS WITH ITS LAP FULL OF FLOWERS THE TINY FEATURES AND LARGE BLUE EYES SMILING THROUGH A SHOCK OF LIGHT BROWN CURLS
1804-131527-0019 BORE SUFFICIENT RESEMBLANCE TO THOSE OF THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN BEFORE ME TO PROCLAIM IT A PORTRAIT OF ARTHUR GRAHAM IN HIS EARLY INFANCY IN TAKING THIS UP TO BRING IT TO THE LIGHT I DISCOVERED ANOTHER BEHIND IT WITH ITS FACE TO THE WALL
1804-131527-0020 I VENTURED TO TAKE THAT UP TOO IT WAS THE PORTRAIT OF A GENTLEMAN IN THE FULL PRIME OF YOUTHFUL MANHOOD HANDSOME ENOUGH AND NOT BADLY EXECUTED
1804-131527-0021 BUT IF DONE BY THE SAME HAND AS THE OTHERS IT WAS EVIDENTLY SOME YEARS BEFORE FOR THERE WAS FAR MORE CAREFUL MINUTENESS OF DETAIL AND LESS OF THAT FRESHNESS OF COLOURING AND FREEDOM OF HANDLING THAT DELIGHTED AND SURPRISED ME IN THEM
1804-131527-0022 NEVERTHELESS I SURVEYED IT WITH CONSIDERABLE INTEREST THERE WAS A CERTAIN INDIVIDUALITY IN THE FEATURES AND EXPRESSION THAT STAMPED IT AT ONCE A SUCCESSFUL LIKENESS
1804-131527-0023 THE BRIGHT BLUE EYES REGARDED THE SPECTATOR WITH A KIND OF LURKING DROLLERY YOU ALMOST EXPECTED TO SEE THEM WINK THE LIPS A LITTLE TOO VOLUPTUOUSLY FULL SEEMED READY TO BREAK INTO A SMILE
1804-131527-0024 THE WARMLY TINTED CHEEKS WERE EMBELLISHED WITH A LUXURIANT GROWTH OF REDDISH WHISKERS WHILE THE BRIGHT CHESTNUT HAIR CLUSTERING IN ABUNDANT WAVY CURLS TRESPASSED TOO MUCH UPON THE FOREHEAD AND SEEMED TO
1804-131527-0025 INTIMATE THAT THE OWNER THEREOF WAS PROUDER OF HIS BEAUTY THAN HIS INTELLECT AS PERHAPS HE HAD REASON TO BE AND YET HE LOOKED NO FOOL I HAD NOT HAD THE PORTRAIT IN MY HANDS TWO MINUTES BEFORE THE FAIR ARTIST RETURNED
1804-131527-0026 ONLY SOME ONE COME ABOUT THE PICTURES SAID SHE IN APOLOGY FOR HER ABRUPT DEPARTURE I TOLD HIM TO WAIT
1804-131527-0027 TO PRESUME TO LOOK AT A PICTURE THAT THE ARTIST HAS TURNED TO THE WALL BUT MAY I ASK
1804-131527-0028 REPLIED SHE ATTEMPTING TO COVER THE TARTNESS OF HER REBUKE WITH A SMILE
1804-131527-0029 SAID I SULKILY RESIGNING THE PICTURE INTO HER HANDS FOR WITHOUT A GRAIN OF CEREMONY SHE TOOK IT FROM ME AND QUICKLY RESTORING IT TO THE DARK CORNER WITH ITS FACE TO THE WALL
1804-131527-0030 BUT I WAS IN NO HUMOUR FOR JESTING I CARELESSLY TURNED TO THE WINDOW AND STOOD LOOKING OUT UPON THE DESOLATE GARDEN LEAVING HER TO TALK TO ROSE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
1804-131527-0031 AND THEN TELLING MY SISTER IT WAS TIME TO GO SHOOK HANDS WITH THE LITTLE GENTLEMAN COOLLY BOWED TO THE LADY AND MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR BUT HAVING BID ADIEU TO ROSE MISSUS GRAHAM PRESENTED HER HAND TO ME
1804-131527-0032 SAYING WITH A SOFT VOICE AND BY NO MEANS A DISAGREEABLE SMILE NOT THE SUN GO DOWN UPON YOUR WRATH MISTER MARKHAM I'M SORRY I OFFENDED YOU BY MY ABRUPTNESS
