8295-281321-0000 UNLESS FOR A VERY LITTLE WHILE YOU WISH TO FEEL SORRY LONG LONG AGO WHEN THE WORLD WAS NEW THERE LIVED A BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS NAMED
8295-281321-0001 SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF OLD A EOLUS KING OF THE WINDS AND LIVED WITH HIM ON HIS HAPPY ISLAND WHERE IT WAS HIS CHIEF BUSINESS
8295-281321-0002 TO KEEP IN ORDER THE FOUR BOISTEROUS BROTHERS BOREAS THE NORTH WIND ZEPHYRUS THE WEST WIND AUSTER THE SOUTH WIND
8295-281321-0003 AND EURUS THE EAST WIND SOMETIMES INDEED A EOLUS HAD A HARD TIME OF IT FOR THE WINDS WOULD ESCAPE FROM HIS CONTROL AND RUSH OUT UPON THE SEA
8295-281321-0004 THE CRUELTIES WHICH THEY PRACTICED AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY ONE DAY THE PRINCE
8295-281321-0005 GREW TO LOVE EACH OTHER DEARLY AND AT LAST WITH THE CONSENT OF GOOD KING A EOLUS BUT TO THE WRATH OF THE FOUR WINDS
8295-281321-0006 TO VISIT A TEMPLE IN A FAR COUNTRY
8295-281321-0007 KNOWING WELL THE CRUELTY OF THE WINDS
8295-281321-0008 SHE KNEW HOW THE MISCHIEVOUS BROTHERS LOVED TO RUSH DOWN UPON VENTURESOME SAILORS AND BLOW THEM INTO DANGER AND SHE KNEW THAT THEY ESPECIALLY HATED HER HUSBAND
8295-281321-0009 BECAUSE HE HAD CARRIED HER AWAY FROM THE ISLAND WHERE SHE HAD WATCHED THE WINDS AT THEIR TERRIBLE PLAY
8295-281321-0010 BUT HE SAID THAT IT WAS NECESSARY THEN SHE PRAYED THAT IF HE MUST GO HE WOULD TAKE HER WITH HIM FOR SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO REMAIN BEHIND DREADING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
8295-281321-0011 SHOULD NOT GO THE GOOD KING LONGED TO TAKE HER WITH HIM NO MORE THAN SHE COULD HE SMILE AT THE THOUGHT OF SEPARATION BUT HE ALSO FEARED THE SEA
8295-281321-0012 AS NOW HE SPOKE THE DAY OF SEPARATION CAME STANDING HEART BROKEN UPON THE SHORE
8295-281321-0013 UNTIL AS A LITTLE SPECK IT DROPPED BELOW THE HORIZON THEN SOBBING BITTERLY SHE RETURNED TO THE PALACE NOW THE KING AND HIS MEN
8295-281321-0014 HAD COMPLETED BUT HALF THEIR JOURNEY WHEN A TERRIBLE STORM AROSE THE WICKED WINDS HAD ESCAPED FROM THE CONTROL OF GOOD OLD A EOLUS AND WERE RUSHING DOWN UPON THE OCEAN TO PUNISH
8295-281321-0015 FIERCELY THEY BLEW THE LIGHTNING FLASHED AND THE SEA RAN HIGH AND IN THE MIDST OF THE HORRIBLE TUMULT THE GOOD SHIP WENT TO THE BOTTOM WITH ALL ON BOARD
8295-281321-0016 AND FAR FROM HIS DEAR WIFE
8295-281321-0017 PERISHED IN THE CRUEL WAVES THAT VERY NIGHT WHEN THE SHIPWRECK OCCURRED
8295-281321-0018 AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT SHE ROSE AND HASTENED TO THE SEASHORE TREMBLING WITH A HORRIBLE DREAD STANDING ON THE VERY SPOT WHENCE SHE HAD LAST SEEN THE FATED SHIP
8295-281321-0019 SHE LOOKED WISTFULLY OVER THE WASTE OF STORMY WATERS AT LAST SHE SPIED A DARK SOMETHING TOSSING ON THE WAVES THE OBJECT FLOATED NEARER AND NEARER
8295-281321-0020 THE BODY OF HER DROWNED HUSBAND
8295-281321-0021 WHICH ADVANCED AND RETREATED SEETHING AROUND HIS BODY BUT A DIFFERENT FATE WAS TO BE HERS AS SHE LEAPED FORWARD
8295-281321-0022 THE FIRST KINGFISHER WHO EVER FLEW LAMENTING ABOVE THE WATERS OF THE WORLD THE SAD BIRD FLUTTERED THROUGH THE SPRAY STRAIGHT TO THE BODY THAT WAS TOSSED UPON THE SURF
8295-281321-0023 AS HER WINGS TOUCHED THE WET SHOULDERS
8295-281321-0024 WHAT WAS ONCE SO DEAR
8295-281321-0025 THE LIMBS STIRRED A FAINT COLOR RETURNED TO THE CHEEKS
8295-281321-0026 HE TOO WAS BECOMING A KINGFISHER HE TOO FELT THE THRILL OF WINGS UPON HIS SHOULDERS WINGS WHICH WERE TO BEAR HIM UP
8295-281321-0027 AND AWAY OUT OF THE SEA WHICH HAD BEEN HIS DEATH HE TOO WAS CLAD IN SOFT PLUMAGE WITH A KINGLY CREST UPON HIS KINGLY HEAD WITH A FAINT CRY HALF OF SORROW FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED
8295-281321-0028 HALF OF JOY FOR THE FUTURE IN WHICH THESE TWO LOVING ONES WERE AT LEAST TO BE TOGETHER
8295-281321-0029 WHERE HIS LIFELESS LIMBS HAD LAIN
8295-281321-0030 SO THOSE UNHAPPY MORTALS BECAME THE FIRST KINGFISHERS HAPPY AT LAST IN BEING REUNITED SO WE SEE THEM STILL FLYING UP AND DOWN OVER THE WATERS OF THE WORLD
8295-281321-0031 WHICH FLOATED ON THE WAVES AS SAFELY AS ANY LITTLE BOAT AND WHILE THEIR CHILDREN THE BABY HALCYONS LAY IN THIS ROCKING CRADLE FOR SEVEN DAYS IN THE HEART OF WINTER
8295-281321-0032 NO STORMS EVER TROUBLED THE OCEAN AND MARINERS COULD SET OUT UPON THEIR VOYAGES WITHOUT FEAR FOR WHILE HIS LITTLE GRANDCHILDREN ROCKED IN THEIR BASKET THE GOOD KING A EOLUS
8295-281321-0033 WAS ALWAYS ESPECIALLY CAREFUL TO CHAIN UP IN PRISON THOSE WICKED BROTHERS THE WINDS
8295-281321-0034 A HALCYON TIME HAS COME TO MEAN
