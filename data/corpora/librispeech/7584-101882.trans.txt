7584-101882-0000 EVEN THE GUESTS FELT A SUBTLE SOMETHING IN THE AIR
7584-101882-0001 WHILE MISSUS MERIDETH AND HER BROTHERS WERE PLAINLY FIGHTING A LOSING CONTEST AGAINST A RESTLESSNESS THAT SENT A HAUNTING FEAR TO THEIR EYES MARGARET
7584-101882-0002 THOUGH SCRUPULOUSLY CAREFUL TO SHOW EVERY ATTENTION TO THE GUESTS THAT COURTESY DEMANDED WAS STRANGELY QUIET AND NOT AT ALL LIKE THE MERRY HIGH SPIRITED GIRL THAT MOST OF THEM KNEW BRANDON WHO WAS AGAIN AT THE HOUSE
7584-101882-0003 SOUGHT HER OUT ONE DAY AND SAID LOW IN HER EAR IF IT WERE JUNE AND NOT DECEMBER AND IF WE WERE OUT IN THE AUTO INSTEAD OF HERE BY THE FIRE I'M WONDERING WOULD I NEED TO WATCH OUT FOR THOSE BRAKES THE GIRL WINCED
7584-101882-0004 NO NO SHE CRIED NEVER I THINK I SHOULD SIMPLY CRAWL FOR FEAR THAT UNDER THE WHEELS SOMEWHERE WOULD BE A CHILD A DOG A CHICKEN OR EVEN A HELPLESS WORM SOMETHING THAT MOVED AND THAT I MIGHT HURT
7584-101882-0005 THERE IS ALREADY SO MUCH SUFFERING BRANDON LAUGHED UNEASILY AND DREW BACK A PUZZLED FROWN ON HIS FACE HE HAD NOT MEANT THAT SHE SHOULD TAKE HIS JEST SO SERIOUSLY IT WAS ON THE DAY AFTER NEW YEAR'S WHEN ALL THE GUESTS HAD GONE
7584-101882-0006 THAT MARGARET ONCE MORE SAID TO HER GUARDIAN THAT SHE WISHED TO SPEAK TO HIM AND ON BUSINESS FRANK SPENCER TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE WAS USED TO THIS SORT OF THING NOW AND THAT HE WAS RESIGNED TO THE INEVITABLE
7584-101882-0007 BUT HIS EYES WERE TROUBLED AND HIS LIPS WERE CLOSE SHUT AS HE MOTIONED THE GIRL TO PRECEDE HIM INTO THE DEN I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU SHE BEGAN PLUNGING INTO HER SUBJECT WITH AN ABRUPTNESS THAT BETRAYED HER NERVOUSNESS
7584-101882-0008 I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU AT ONCE THAT I I CANNOT GO WITH YOU WHEN YOU ALL GO AWAY NEXT WEEK YOU CANNOT GO WITH US NO I MUST STAY HERE HERE
7584-101882-0009 WHY MARGARET CHILD THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE HERE IN THIS GREAT HOUSE WITH ONLY THE SERVANTS NO NO YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND NOT HERE AT HILCREST I SHALL BE DOWN IN THE TOWN WITH PATTY MARGARET
7584-101882-0010 THE MAN WAS TOO DISMAYED TO SAY MORE I KNOW IT SEEMS STRANGE TO YOU OF COURSE REJOINED THE GIRL HASTILY BUT YOU WILL SEE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHEN I EXPLAIN I HAVE THOUGHT OF IT IN ALL ITS BEARINGS
7584-101882-0011 AND IT IS THE ONLY WAY I COULD NOT GO WITH YOU AND SING AND LAUGH AND DANCE AND ALL THE WHILE REMEMBER THAT MY PEOPLE BACK HERE WERE SUFFERING YOUR PEOPLE DEAR CHILD
7584-101882-0012 THEY ARE NOT YOUR PEOPLE NOR MY PEOPLE THEY ARE THEIR OWN PEOPLE THEY COME AND GO AS THEY LIKE IF NOT IN MY MILLS THEY WORK IN SOME OTHER MAN'S MILLS YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR WELFARE BESIDES
7584-101882-0013 YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE MORE FOR THEIR COMFORT AND HAPPINESS THAN ANY HUMAN BEING COULD EXPECT OF YOU I KNOW BUT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT IS IN A PECULIAR WAY THAT THEY ARE MY PEOPLE NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE HERE
7584-101882-0014 BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE POOR AND UNHAPPY MARGARET HESITATED AND THEN WENT ON HER EYES TURNED AWAY FROM HER GUARDIAN'S FACE I DON'T KNOW AS I CAN MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND AS I DO THERE ARE PEOPLE LOTS OF THEM
7584-101882-0015 WHO ARE GENEROUS AND KIND TO THE POOR BUT THEY ARE ON ONE SIDE OF THE LINE AND THE POOR ARE ON THE OTHER THEY MERELY PASS THINGS OVER THE LINE THEY NEVER GO THEMSELVES AND THAT IS ALL RIGHT
7584-101882-0016 THEY COULD NOT CROSS THE LINE IF THEY WANTED TO PERHAPS THEY WOULD NOT KNOW HOW ALL THEIR LIVES THEY HAVE BEEN SURROUNDED WITH TENDER CARE AND LUXURY THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUNGRY AND COLD AND HOMELESS
7584-101882-0017 MARGARET PAUSED HER EYES STILL AVERTED THEN SUDDENLY SHE TURNED AND FACED THE MAN SITTING IN SILENT DISMAY AT THE DESK DON'T YOU SEE SHE CRIED I HAVE CROSSED THE LINE
7584-101882-0018 I CROSSED IT LONG AGO WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL I DO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUNGRY AND COLD AND HOMELESS I DO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO FIGHT THE WORLD WITH ONLY TWO SMALL EMPTY HANDS
7584-101882-0019 THEY ARE MY PEOPLE FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS SILENCE IN THE LITTLE ROOM TO THE MAN AT THE DESK THE BOTTOM SEEMED SUDDENLY TO HAVE DROPPED OUT OF HIS WORLD FOR SOME TIME IT HAD BEEN GROWING ON HIM THE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW MUCH THE PRESENCE OF THIS FAIR HAIRED
7584-101882-0020 WINSOME GIRL MEANT TO HIM IT CAME TO HIM NOW WITH THE STAGGERING FORCE OF A BLOW IN THE FACE AND SHE WAS GOING AWAY TO FRANK SPENCER THE DAYS SUDDENLY STRETCHED AHEAD IN EMPTY USELESSNESS
7584-101882-0021 THERE SEEMED TO BE NOTHING LEFT WORTH WHILE BUT MY DEAR MARGARET HE SAID AT LAST UNSTEADILY WE TRIED WE ALL TRIED TO MAKE YOU FORGET THOSE TERRIBLE DAYS YOU WERE SO KEENLY SENSITIVE
7584-101882-0022 THEY WEIGHED TOO HEAVILY ON YOUR HEART YOU YOU WERE MORBID MY DEAR I KNOW SHE SAID I UNDERSTAND BETTER NOW EVERY ONE TRIED TO INTEREST ME TO AMUSE ME TO MAKE ME FORGET

7584-101882-0024 BUT I NEVER DID FORGET QUITE EVEN WHEN YEARS AND YEARS HAD PASSED AND I COULD GO EVERYWHERE AND SEE ALL THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS AND PLACES I HAD READ ABOUT AND WHEN I WAS WITH MY FRIENDS
7584-101882-0025 THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING SOMEWHERE BEHIND THINGS THOSE FOUR YEARS IN NEW YORK WERE VAGUE AND ELUSIVE AS TIME PASSED THEY SEEMED LIKE A DREAM OR LIKE A LIFE THAT SOME ONE ELSE HAD LIVED
7584-101882-0026 THEY WERE NOT A DREAM AND THEY WERE NOT A LIFE THAT SOME ONE ELSE LIVED THEY WERE MY LIFE I LIVED THEM MYSELF DON'T YOU SEE NOW MARGARET'S EYES WERE LUMINOUS WITH FEELING HER LIPS TREMBLED
7584-101882-0027 BUT HER FACE GLOWED WITH A STRANGE EXALTATION OF HAPPINESS BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO FALTERED THE MAN MARGARET FLUSHED AND LEANED FORWARD EAGERLY I AM GOING TO DO ALL THAT I CAN
7584-101882-0028 AND I HOPE IT WILL BE A GREAT DEAL I AM GOING DOWN THERE TO LIVE TO LIVE NOT TO LIVE CHILD YES OH I KNOW NOW SHE WENT ON HURRIEDLY I HAVE BEEN AMONG THEM SOME ARE WICKED AND SOME ARE THOUGHTLESS
7584-101882-0029 BUT ALL OF THEM NEED TEACHING I AM GOING TO LIVE THERE AMONG THEM TO SHOW THEM THE BETTER WAY THE MAN AT THE DESK LEFT HIS CHAIR ABRUPTLY HE WALKED OVER TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT THE MOON SHONE CLEAR AND BRIGHT IN THE SKY
7584-101882-0030 DOWN IN THE VALLEY THE COUNTLESS GLEAMING WINDOWS AND THE TALL BLACK CHIMNEYS SHOWED WHERE THE MILL WORKERS STILL TOILED THOSE MILL WORKERS WHOM THE MAN HAD COME ALMOST TO HATE IT WAS BECAUSE OF THEM THAT MARGARET WAS GOING
7584-101882-0031 HE TURNED SLOWLY AND WALKED BACK TO THE GIRL MARGARET
7584-101882-0032 I HAD NOT THOUGHT TO SPEAK OF THIS AT LEAST NOT NOW PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER IF I NEVER SPOKE OF IT BUT I AM ALMOST FORCED TO SAY IT NOW I CAN'T LET YOU GO LIKE THIS AND NOT KNOW
7584-101882-0033 I MUST MAKE ONE EFFORT TO KEEP YOU IF YOU KNEW THAT THERE WAS SOME ONE HERE WHO LOVED YOU WHO LOVED YOU WITH THE WHOLE STRENGTH OF HIS BEING
7584-101882-0034 MEANT EVERYTHING THAT WAS LONELINESS AND GRIEF WOULD YOU COULD YOU STAY MARGARET STARTED SHE WOULD NOT LOOK INTO THE EYES THAT WERE SO EARNESTLY SEEKING HERS
7584-101882-0035 IT WAS OF NED OF COURSE THAT HE WAS SPEAKING OF THAT SHE WAS SURE IN SOME WAY HE HAD DISCOVERED NED'S FEELING FOR HER HAD PERHAPS EVEN BEEN ASKED TO PLEAD HIS CAUSE WITH HER
7584-101882-0036 DID YOU EVER THINK BEGAN SPENCER AGAIN SOFTLY DID YOU EVER THINK THAT IF YOU DID STAY YOU MIGHT FIND EVEN HERE SOME ONE TO WHOM YOU COULD SHOW THE BETTER WAY THAT EVEN HERE
7584-101882-0037 YOU MIGHT DO ALL THESE THINGS YOU LONG TO DO AND WITH SOME ONE CLOSE BY YOUR SIDE TO HELP YOU MARGARET THOUGHT OF NED OF HIS IMPULSIVENESS HIS LIGHT HEARTEDNESS
7584-101882-0038 HIS UTTER WANT OF SYMPATHY WITH EVERYTHING SHE HAD BEEN DOING THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND INVOLUNTARILY SHE SHUDDERED SPENCER SAW THE SENSITIVE QUIVER AND DREW BACK TOUCHED TO THE QUICK MARGARET STRUGGLED TO HER FEET
7584-101882-0039 NO NO SHE CRIED STILL REFUSING TO MEET HIS EYES I I CANNOT STAY I AM SORRY BELIEVE ME TO GIVE YOU PAIN BUT I I CANNOT STAY
7584-101882-0040 AND SHE HURRIED FROM THE ROOM THE MAN DROPPED BACK IN HIS CHAIR HIS FACE WHITE SHE DOES NOT LOVE ME AND NO WONDER
