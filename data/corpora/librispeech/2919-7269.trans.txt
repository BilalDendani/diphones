2919-7269-0000 A LINE OF DOORS FLEW OPEN AND A LOT OF MEN STEPPED OUT HEADLONG THEY HAD HIGH HATS HEALTHY PALE FACES DARK OVERCOATS AND SHINY BOOTS THEY HELD IN THEIR GLOVED HANDS THIN UMBRELLAS AND HASTILY FOLDED EVENING PAPERS
2919-7269-0001 THAT RESEMBLED STIFF DIRTY RAGS OF GREENISH PINKISH OR WHITISH COLOUR ALVAN HERVEY STEPPED OUT WITH THE REST A SMOULDERING CIGAR BETWEEN HIS TEETH A DISREGARDED LITTLE WOMAN IN RUSTY BLACK WITH BOTH ARMS FULL OF PARCELS
2919-7269-0002 NO ONE SPARED HIM A GLANCE ALVAN HERVEY PASSED THROUGH THE TICKET GATE BETWEEN THE BARE WALLS OF A SORDID STAIRCASE MEN CLAMBERED RAPIDLY THEIR BACKS APPEARED ALIKE
2919-7269-0003 ALMOST AS IF THEY HAD BEEN WEARING A UNIFORM THEIR INDIFFERENT FACES WERE VARIED BUT SOMEHOW SUGGESTED KINSHIP
2919-7269-0004 DIGNITY DISGUST OR FORESIGHT WOULD RESOLUTELY IGNORE EACH OTHER AND THEIR EYES QUICK OR SLOW THEIR EYES GAZING UP THE DUSTY STEPS THEIR EYES BROWN BLACK GRAY BLUE HAD ALL THE SAME STARE
2919-7269-0005 CONCENTRATED AND EMPTY SATISFIED AND UNTHINKING OUTSIDE THE BIG DOORWAY OF THE STREET THEY SCATTERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS WALKING AWAY FAST FROM ONE ANOTHER
2919-7269-0006 FROM FAMILIARITY OR CONFIDENCES FROM SOMETHING SUSPECTED AND CONCEALED LIKE TRUTH OR PESTILENCE ALVAN HERVEY HESITATED STANDING ALONE IN THE DOORWAY FOR A MOMENT THEN DECIDED TO WALK HOME
2919-7269-0007 HE STRODE FIRMLY A MISTY RAIN SETTLED LIKE SILVERY DUST ON CLOTHES ON MOUSTACHES WETTED THE FACES VARNISHED THE FLAGSTONES DARKENED THE WALLS DRIPPED FROM UMBRELLAS
2919-7269-0008 BY THE EASY MASTERY OVER ANIMALS AND OVER NEEDY MEN HE WAS GOING HOME MUCH EARLIER THAN USUAL STRAIGHT FROM THE CITY AND WITHOUT CALLING AT HIS CLUB HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF
2919-7269-0009 WELL CONNECTED WELL EDUCATED AND INTELLIGENT WHO DOESN'T BUT HIS CONNECTIONS EDUCATION AND INTELLIGENCE WERE STRICTLY ON A PAR WITH THOSE OF THE MEN WITH WHOM HE DID BUSINESS OR AMUSED HIMSELF HE HAD MARRIED FIVE YEARS AGO AT THE TIME
2919-7269-0010 ALL HIS ACQUAINTANCES HAD SAID HE WAS VERY MUCH IN LOVE AND HE HAD SAID SO HIMSELF FRANKLY BECAUSE IT IS VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT EVERY MAN FALLS IN LOVE ONCE IN HIS LIFE UNLESS HIS WIFE DIES WHEN IT MAY BE QUITE PRAISEWORTHY TO FALL IN LOVE AGAIN
2919-7269-0011 THE GIRL WAS HEALTHY TALL FAIR AND IN HIS OPINION WAS WELL CONNECTED WELL EDUCATED AND INTELLIGENT SHE WAS ALSO INTENSELY BORED WITH HER HOME WHERE AS IF PACKED IN A TIGHT BOX
2919-7269-0012 HER INDIVIDUALITY OF WHICH SHE WAS VERY CONSCIOUS HAD NO PLAY SHE STRODE LIKE A GRENADIER WAS STRONG AND UPRIGHT LIKE AN OBELISK HAD A BEAUTIFUL FACE A CANDID BROW PURE EYES
2919-7269-0013 HE SURRENDERED QUICKLY TO ALL THOSE CHARMS AND SHE APPEARED TO HIM SO UNQUESTIONABLY OF THE RIGHT SORT THAT HE DID NOT HESITATE FOR A MOMENT TO DECLARE HIMSELF IN LOVE UNDER THE COVER OF THAT SACRED AND POETICAL FICTION HE DESIRED HER MASTERFULLY
2919-7269-0014 FOR VARIOUS REASONS BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR THE SATISFACTION OF HAVING HIS OWN WAY HE WAS VERY DULL AND SOLEMN ABOUT IT FOR NO EARTHLY REASON UNLESS TO CONCEAL HIS FEELINGS WHICH IS AN EMINENTLY PROPER THING TO DO
2919-7269-0015 NOBODY HOWEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SHOCKED HAD HE NEGLECTED THAT DUTY FOR THE FEELING HE EXPERIENCED REALLY WAS A LONGING A LONGING STRONGER AND A LITTLE MORE COMPLEX NO DOUBT BUT NO MORE REPREHENSIBLE IN ITS NATURE THAN A HUNGRY MAN'S APPETITE FOR HIS DINNER
2919-7269-0016 AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE THEY BUSIED THEMSELVES WITH MARKED SUCCESS IN ENLARGING THE CIRCLE OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE THIRTY PEOPLE KNEW THEM BY SIGHT TWENTY MORE WITH SMILING DEMONSTRATIONS
2919-7269-0017 TOLERATED THEIR OCCASIONAL PRESENCE WITHIN HOSPITABLE THRESHOLDS AT LEAST FIFTY OTHERS BECAME AWARE OF THEIR EXISTENCE THEY MOVED IN THEIR ENLARGED WORLD AMONGST PERFECTLY DELIGHTFUL MEN AND WOMEN WHO FEARED EMOTION ENTHUSIASM OR FAILURE
2919-7269-0018 MORE THAN FIRE WAR OR MORTAL DISEASE WHO TOLERATED ONLY THE COMMONEST FORMULAS OF COMMONEST THOUGHTS AND RECOGNIZED ONLY PROFITABLE FACTS IT WAS AN EXTREMELY CHARMING SPHERE THE ABODE OF ALL THE VIRTUES
2919-7269-0019 TO CONCEAL THE PITILESS MATERIALISM OF THOUGHTS AND ASPIRATIONS ALVAN HERVEY AND HIS WIFE SPENT FIVE YEARS OF PRUDENT BLISS UNCLOUDED BY ANY DOUBT AS TO THE MORAL PROPRIETY OF THEIR EXISTENCE SHE TO GIVE HER INDIVIDUALITY FAIR PLAY
2919-7269-0020 TOOK UP ALL MANNER OF PHILANTHROPIC WORK AND BECAME A MEMBER OF VARIOUS RESCUING AND REFORMING SOCIETIES PATRONIZED OR PRESIDED OVER BY LADIES OF TITLE HE TOOK AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN POLITICS AND HAVING MET QUITE BY CHANCE A LITERARY MAN WHO NEVERTHELESS WAS RELATED TO AN EARL
2919-7269-0021 HE WAS INDUCED TO FINANCE A MORIBUND SOCIETY PAPER IT WAS A SEMI POLITICAL AND WHOLLY SCANDALOUS PUBLICATION REDEEMED BY EXCESSIVE DULNESS AND AS IT WAS UTTERLY FAITHLESS
2919-7269-0022 AND HE ENJOYED ALSO THE SPECIAL KIND OF IMPORTANCE HE DERIVED FROM THIS CONNECTION WITH WHAT HE IMAGINED TO BE LITERATURE THIS CONNECTION STILL FURTHER ENLARGED THEIR WORLD
2919-7269-0023 MEN WHO WROTE OR DREW PRETTILY FOR THE PUBLIC CAME AT TIMES TO THEIR HOUSE AND HIS EDITOR CAME VERY OFTEN HE THOUGHT HIM RATHER AN ASS BECAUSE HE HAD SUCH BIG FRONT TEETH
2919-7269-0024 ELEGANT AND BULKY IN THE DRAWING ROOM
2919-7269-0025 AND TALKED FOR HOURS WITH A THICK LIPPED SMILE HE SAID NOTHING THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED OBJECTIONABLE AND NOT QUITE THE THING TALKED IN AN UNUSUAL MANNER NOT OBVIOUSLY IRRITATINGLY HIS FOREHEAD WAS TOO LOFTY UNUSUALLY SO
2919-7269-0026 AND UNDER IT THERE WAS A STRAIGHT NOSE LOST BETWEEN THE HAIRLESS CHEEKS THAT IN A SMOOTH CURVE RAN INTO A CHIN SHAPED LIKE THE END OF A SNOW SHOE AND IN THIS FACE THAT RESEMBLED THE FACE OF A FAT AND FIENDISHLY KNOWING BABY
2919-7269-0027 THERE GLITTERED A PAIR OF CLEVER PEERING UNBELIEVING BLACK EYES HE WROTE VERSES TOO RATHER AN ASS BUT THE BAND OF MEN WHO TRAILED AT THE SKIRTS OF HIS MONUMENTAL FROCK COAT SEEMED TO PERCEIVE WONDERFUL THINGS IN WHAT HE SAID
2919-7269-0028 ALVAN HERVEY PUT IT DOWN TO AFFECTATION THOSE ARTIST CHAPS UPON THE WHOLE WERE SO AFFECTED STILL ALL THIS WAS HIGHLY PROPER VERY USEFUL TO HIM AND HIS WIFE SEEMED TO LIKE IT AS IF SHE ALSO HAD DERIVED SOME DISTINCT AND SECRET ADVANTAGE
2919-7269-0029 FROM THIS INTELLECTUAL CONNECTION SHE RECEIVED HER MIXED AND DECOROUS GUESTS WITH A KIND OF TALL PONDEROUS GRACE
2919-7269-0030 ANNEXING STREET AFTER STREET IT INCLUDED ALSO SOMEBODY'S GARDENS A CRESCENT A COUPLE OF SQUARES THUS ALVAN HERVEY AND HIS WIFE FOR FIVE PROSPEROUS YEARS LIVED BY THE SIDE OF ONE ANOTHER
2919-7269-0031 IN TIME THEY CAME TO KNOW EACH OTHER SUFFICIENTLY WELL FOR ALL THE PRACTICAL PURPOSES OF SUCH AN EXISTENCE BUT THEY WERE NO MORE CAPABLE OF REAL INTIMACY THAN TWO ANIMALS FEEDING AT THE SAME MANGER UNDER THE SAME ROOF IN A LUXURIOUS STABLE
2919-7269-0032 AND HER OWN SHARE OF THE WORLD'S RESPECT ENVY AND APPLAUSE THEY UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER WARILY TACITLY LIKE A PAIR OF CAUTIOUS CONSPIRATORS IN A PROFITABLE PLOT BECAUSE THEY WERE BOTH UNABLE TO LOOK AT A FACT
2919-7269-0033 A SENTIMENT A PRINCIPLE OR A BELIEF OTHERWISE THAN IN THE LIGHT OF THEIR OWN DIGNITY OF THEIR OWN GLORIFICATION OF THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE THEY SKIMMED OVER THE SURFACE OF LIFE HAND IN HAND IN A PURE AND FROSTY ATMOSPHERE
2919-7269-0034 LIKE TWO SKILFUL SKATERS CUTTING FIGURES ON THICK ICE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF THE BEHOLDERS AND DISDAINFULLY IGNORING THE HIDDEN STREAM THE STREAM RESTLESS AND DARK THE STREAM OF LIFE PROFOUND AND UNFROZEN
2919-7269-0035 THERE WAS NOTHING UNUSUAL IN THAT HE SAID NO NO TEA AND WENT UPSTAIRS HE ASCENDED WITHOUT FOOTFALLS BRASS RODS GLIMMERED ALL UP THE RED CARPET ON THE FIRST FLOOR LANDING A MARBLE WOMAN
2919-7269-0036 DECENTLY COVERED FROM NECK TO INSTEP WITH STONE DRAPERIES ADVANCED A ROW OF LIFELESS TOES TO THE EDGE OF THE PEDESTAL AND THRUST OUT BLINDLY A RIGID WHITE ARM HOLDING A CLUSTER OF LIGHTS HE HAD ARTISTIC TASTES AT HOME
2919-7269-0037 A YOUNG LADY SPRAWLED WITH DREAMY EYES IN A MOORED BOAT IN COMPANY OF A LUNCH BASKET A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE AND AN ENAMOURED MAN IN A BLAZER BARE LEGGED BOYS FLIRTED SWEETLY WITH RAGGED MAIDENS
2919-7269-0038 SEEMED TO REPRESENT A MASSACRE TURNED INTO STONE HE LOOKED OF COURSE AT NOTHING ASCENDED ANOTHER FLIGHT OF STAIRS AND WENT STRAIGHT INTO THE DRESSING ROOM
2919-7269-0039 A BRONZE DRAGON NAILED BY THE TAIL TO A BRACKET WRITHED AWAY FROM THE WALL IN CALM CONVOLUTIONS AND HELD BETWEEN THE CONVENTIONAL FURY OF ITS JAWS A CRUDE GAS FLAME THAT RESEMBLED A BUTTERFLY
2919-7269-0040 THE ROOM WAS EMPTY OF COURSE BUT AS HE STEPPED IN IT BECAME FILLED ALL AT ONCE WITH A STIR OF MANY PEOPLE BECAUSE THE STRIPS OF GLASS ON THE DOORS OF WARDROBES AND HIS WIFE'S LARGE PIER GLASS
2919-7269-0041 REFLECTED HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND MULTIPLIED HIS IMAGE INTO A CROWD OF GENTLEMANLY AND SLAVISH IMITATORS WHO WERE DRESSED EXACTLY LIKE HIMSELF HAD THE SAME RESTRAINED AND RARE GESTURES WHO MOVED WHEN HE MOVED
2919-7269-0042 STOOD STILL WITH HIM IN AN OBSEQUIOUS IMMOBILITY AND HAD JUST SUCH APPEARANCES OF LIFE AND FEELING AS HE THOUGHT IT DIGNIFIED AND SAFE FOR ANY MAN TO MANIFEST AND LIKE REAL PEOPLE WHO ARE SLAVES OF COMMON THOUGHTS THAT ARE NOT EVEN THEIR OWN
2919-7269-0043 THEY SEEMED TO DODGE BEHIND WALNUT FURNITURE TO BE SEEN AGAIN FAR WITHIN THE POLISHED PANES STEPPING ABOUT DISTINCT AND UNREAL IN THE CONVINCING ILLUSION OF A ROOM AND LIKE THE MEN HE RESPECTED THEY COULD BE TRUSTED TO DO NOTHING INDIVIDUAL
2919-7269-0044 ORIGINAL OR STARTLING NOTHING UNFORESEEN AND NOTHING IMPROPER HE MOVED FOR A TIME AIMLESSLY IN THAT GOOD COMPANY HUMMING A POPULAR BUT REFINED TUNE AND THINKING VAGUELY OF A BUSINESS LETTER FROM ABROAD
2919-7269-0045 THE SQUARE WHITE PATCH OF AN ENVELOPE IT WAS SUCH AN UNUSUAL THING TO BE SEEN THERE THAT HE SPUN ROUND ALMOST BEFORE HE REALIZED HIS SURPRISE AND ALL THE SHAM MEN ABOUT HIM PIVOTED ON THEIR HEELS ALL APPEARED SURPRISED
2919-7269-0046 STRUCK HIM AS SO OUTRAGEOUS THAT THINKING OF IT HE EXPERIENCED SUDDENLY A STAGGERING SENSE OF INSECURITY AN ABSURD AND BIZARRE FLASH OF A NOTION THAT THE HOUSE HAD MOVED A LITTLE UNDER HIS FEET HE TORE THE ENVELOPE OPEN GLANCED AT THE LETTER
2919-7269-0047 AND SAT DOWN IN A CHAIR NEAR BY HE HELD THE PAPER BEFORE HIS EYES AND LOOKED AT HALF A DOZEN LINES SCRAWLED ON THE PAGE
2919-7269-0048 A GREAT AIMLESS UPROAR THAT IN A MANNER PREVENTED HIM FROM HEARING HIMSELF THINK AND MADE HIS MIND AN ABSOLUTE BLANK THIS ABSURD AND DISTRACTING TUMULT SEEMED TO OOZE OUT OF THE WRITTEN WORDS
2919-7269-0049 THAT TREMBLED HOLDING THE PAPER AND SUDDENLY HE DROPPED THE LETTER AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SOMETHING HOT OR VENOMOUS OR FILTHY AND RUSHING TO THE WINDOW WITH THE UNREFLECTING PRECIPITATION OF A MAN ANXIOUS TO RAISE AN ALARM OF FIRE OR MURDER
2919-7269-0050 HE THREW IT UP AND PUT HIS HEAD OUT A CHILL GUST OF WIND WANDERING THROUGH THE DAMP AND SOOTY OBSCURITY OVER THE WASTE OF ROOFS AND CHIMNEY POTS TOUCHED HIS FACE WITH A CLAMMY FLICK HE SAW AN ILLIMITABLE DARKNESS
2919-7269-0051 IN WHICH STOOD A BLACK JUMBLE OF WALLS AND BETWEEN THEM THE MANY ROWS OF GASLIGHTS STRETCHED FAR AWAY IN LONG LINES LIKE STRUNG UP BEADS OF FIRE
2919-7269-0052 A SINISTER LOOM AS OF A HIDDEN CONFLAGRATION LIT UP FAINTLY FROM BELOW THE MIST FALLING UPON A BILLOWY AND MOTIONLESS SEA OF TILES AND BRICKS AT THE RATTLE OF THE OPENED WINDOW THE WORLD SEEMED TO LEAP OUT OF THE NIGHT AND CONFRONT HIM
2919-7269-0053 WHILE FLOATING UP TO HIS EARS THERE CAME A SOUND VAST AND FAINT THE DEEP MUTTER OF SOMETHING IMMENSE AND ALIVE IT PENETRATED HIM WITH A FEELING OF DISMAY AND HE GASPED SILENTLY
2919-7269-0054 FROM THE CAB STAND IN THE SQUARE CAME DISTINCT HOARSE VOICES AND A JEERING LAUGH WHICH SOUNDED OMINOUSLY HARSH AND CRUEL IT SOUNDED THREATENING HE DREW HIS HEAD IN
2919-7269-0055 AS IF BEFORE AN AIMED BLOW AND FLUNG THE WINDOW DOWN QUICKLY HE MADE A FEW STEPS STUMBLED AGAINST A CHAIR AND WITH A GREAT EFFORT PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER TO LAY HOLD OF A CERTAIN THOUGHT THAT WAS WHIZZING ABOUT LOOSE IN HIS HEAD
2919-7269-0056 HE GOT IT AT LAST AFTER MORE EXERTION THAN HE EXPECTED HE WAS FLUSHED AND PUFFED A LITTLE AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN CATCHING IT WITH HIS HANDS BUT HIS MENTAL HOLD ON IT WAS WEAK
2919-7269-0057 TO HEAR IT SPOKEN FIRMLY IN ORDER TO INSURE A PERFECT MEASURE OF POSSESSION BUT HE WAS UNWILLING TO HEAR HIS OWN VOICE TO HEAR ANY SOUND WHATEVER OWING TO A VAGUE BELIEF SHAPING ITSELF SLOWLY WITHIN HIM
2919-7269-0058 THAT SOLITUDE AND SILENCE ARE THE GREATEST FELICITIES OF MANKIND THE NEXT MOMENT IT DAWNED UPON HIM THAT THEY ARE PERFECTLY UNATTAINABLE THAT FACES MUST BE SEEN WORDS SPOKEN
2919-7269-0059 THOUGHTS HEARD ALL THE WORDS ALL THE THOUGHTS HE SAID VERY DISTINCTLY AND LOOKING AT THE CARPET
