5290-26685-0000 IT WAS A PLEASANT MORNING IN LONDON WITH AS CLEAR A SKY AS IS EVER PERMITTED TO THAT GREAT CITY CASSANDRA HAD PLACED HER LITTLE SON IN THE MIDDLE OF A HUGE BED WHICH NEARLY FILLED THE SMALL ROOM SHE HAD BEEN GIVEN IN A HOTEL
5290-26685-0001 RECOMMENDED TO HER BY BETTY TOWERS AS ONE WHERE NICE LADIES TRAVELLING ALONE COULD STOP THE CHILD WAS DRESSED IN A FRESH WHITE COAT AND CASSANDRA HAD MUCH ADO TO KEEP HIM CLEAN
5290-26685-0002 SHE HEAPED HIM ABOUT WITH PILLOWS AND BEDCLOTHING TO MAKE A NEST FOR HIM AND GAVE HIM A SPOON AND A DRINKING CUP FOR ENTERTAINMENT
5290-26685-0003 AND LACE CURTAINS THAT OBSCURED THE ONE HIGH NARROW WINDOW OF HER ROOM SHE HAD TRIED TO PUT THEM ONE SIDE THAT SHE MIGHT LOOK OUT WHEN SHE AWOKE BUT SHE COULD SEE ONLY CHIMNEY POTS AND GRIMY IRREGULARLY TILED ROOFS
5290-26685-0004 A NARROW OPENING AT THE TOP OF THE WINDOW LET IN A LITTLE AIR STILL SHE FELT SMOTHERED AND TRIED TO RAISE THE LOWER SASH BUT COULD NOT MOVE IT SHE THOUGHT OF THE BOOKS SHE HAD READ ABOUT GREAT CITIES
5290-26685-0005 AND HOW SOME PEOPLE HAD TO LIVE IN PLACES LIKE THIS ALWAYS AND HER HEART FILLED WITH A LARGE PITY FOR THEM HERE ONLY A SMALL TRIANGLE OF BLUE SKY COULD BE SEEN NOT A TREE NOT A BIT OF EARTH
5290-26685-0006 AND IN THE SMALL ROOM ALL THOSE HEAVY FURNISHINGS CLOSED AROUND HER DARK RED STUFFY AND GREASY WITH LONDON SMOKE SHE COULD NOT TOUCH THEM WITHOUT BLACKENING HER HANDS NOR LET HER BABY SIT ON THE FLOOR
5290-26685-0007 FOR THE DIRT HE WIPED UP ON HIS CLOTHING AS HE ROLLED AND KICKED ABOUT THE ROOM SEEMED TO SWAY AND TIP AS THE SHIP HAD DONE AND THERE WAS A CONTINUOUS SOUND AS OF THUNDER A STRANGE UNDERCURRENT THAT SEEMED TO HER STRAINED NERVES
5290-26685-0008 LIKE THE MOANING OF THE LOST SOULS OF ALL THE AGES WHO HAD LIVED AND TOILED AND SMOTHERED IN THIS MONSTROUS AND TERRIBLE CITY AH SHE MUST GET OUT OF IT SHE MUST HURRY HURRY AND FIND DAVID HE WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HIS LITTLE SON
5290-26685-0009 HE WOULD TAKE HIM IN HIS ARMS HE WOULD HOLD THEM BOTH TO HIS HEART SHE WOULD SEE HIM SMILE AGAIN AND LOOK IN HIS EYES AND ALL THIS FOREBODING WOULD CEASE AND THE WOFUL SOUNDS DIE OUT OF THE AIR AND BECOME ONLY THE NATURAL ROAR OF THE ACTIVITIES AND TRAFFIC OF A GREAT CITY
5290-26685-0010 SHE MUST GET USED TO ALL THIS AND NOT EXPECT TO FIND ALL THE WORLD LIKE HER OWN SUNNY MOUNTAINS THE BISHOP'S CAREFUL LITTLE WIFE HAD TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO HER HOW TO MEET HER NEW EXPERIENCES SHE WAS TO GO NOWHERE ALONE
5290-26685-0011 WITHOUT TAKING A CAB AND NEVER START OUT ON FOOT CARRYING HER BABY IN HER ARMS AS SHE MIGHT DO AT HOME SHE HAD GIVEN HER WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO CONDUCT HERSELF UNDER ALL ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES AT HER HOTEL OR ON THE STREET
5290-26685-0012 HOW TO RING FOR A SERVANT ORDER HER MEALS OR CALL A CAB NOW STANDING BEFORE HER MIRROR CASSANDRA ESSAYED TO ARRANGE HER HAIR AS SHE HAD SEEN OTHER YOUNG WOMEN WEAR THEIRS BUT SHE THOUGHT THE NEW WAY LOOKED UNTIDY
5290-26685-0013 DAVID WOULD NOT MIND IF SHE DID NOT DO HER HAIR AS OTHERS DID HE WOULD BE SO GLAD TO SEE HER AND HIS LITTLE SON AH THE COMFORT OF THAT LITTLE SON SHE LEANED OVER THE BED
5290-26685-0014 HALF DRESSED AS SHE WAS AND MURMURED PRETTY COOING PHRASES KISSING AND CUDDLING HIM TO CONTENTED LAUGHTER BETTY TOWERS HAD PROCURED CLOTHING FOR HER A MODEST SUPPLY
5290-26685-0015 USING HER OWN GOOD TASTE AND NOT DISGUISING CASSANDRA'S NATURAL GRACE AND DIGNITY BY A TOO CLOSE ADHERENCE TO THE PREVAILING MODE THERE WERE A BLUE TRAVELLING GOWN AND JACKET AND A TOQUE OF THE SAME COLOR WITH A WHITE WING A SOFT CLINGING BLACK SILK
5290-26685-0016 MADE WITH GIRLISH SIMPLICITY WHICH ADMIRABLY BECAME HER AND A WIDE FLEXIBLE BRIMMED HAT WITH A SINGLE HEAVY PLUME TAKEN FROM BETTY'S OWN HAT OF THE LAST WINTER CASSANDRA STOOD A LONG MOMENT BEFORE THE TWO GOWNS
5290-26685-0017 SHE DESIRED TO DON THE SILK BUT BETTY HAD TOLD HER ALWAYS TO WEAR THE BLUE IN THE MORNING SO AT LAST SHE OBEYED HER KIND ADVISER WHILE WAITING WITH HER BABY IN HER ARMS FOR THE HOTEL BOY TO CALL HER CAB SHE OBSERVED ANOTHER LADY YOUNG

5290-26685-0020 AND THEY WERE RATTLED AWAY OVER THE ROUGH PAVING A LONG LONELY RIDE THROUGH THE WONDERFUL CITY SO MANY MILES OF HOUSES AND SPLENDID BUILDINGS OF GARDENS AND MONUMENTS STRANGELY THE PEOPLE OF VANITY FAIR LEAPED OUT OF THE BOOK SHE HAD READ

5290-26685-0028 HER GRAVITY AND SILENCE GAVE HER A POISE AND DIGNITY THAT ALLAYED SUSPICION BUT HE AND HIS OLD WIFE LIKED DIVERSION AND A SPICE OF GOSSIP LIGHTENED THE MONOTONY OF THEIR LIVES SO HE WAITED
