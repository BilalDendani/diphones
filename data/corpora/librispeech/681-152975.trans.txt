681-152975-0016 NOBODY ELSE IN THE FAMILY WOULD BELIEVE ME WHEN I TOLD THEM ABOUT IT IT LOOKED LIKE A MAN IN A LONG WHITE ROBE AND LONG HAIR AND A LONG WHITE BEARD IT WAS MOONLIGHT AND I WAS LOOKING OUT OF MY BEDROOM WINDOW

681-152975-0023 WE WERE VERY MUCH INTERESTED WHEN WE LEARNED THAT A COMPANY OF CAMP FIRE GIRLS WERE CAMPING NEAR US
681-152975-0024 DON'T YOU GIRLS CAMP OUT ANY KATHERINE ASKED WITH THE VIEW OF POSSIBLY BRINGING OUT AN EXPLANATION OF THE GRAHAM GIRLS ATTIRE WHICH SEEMED SUITED MORE FOR PROMENADING ALONG
681-152975-0025 A METROPOLITAN BOULEVARD THAN FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE
681-152975-0026 WE'D LIKE TO WELL ENOUGH YOU KNOW BUT WE'RE IN SOCIETY SO MUCH THAT WE JUST DON'T HAVE TIME KATHERINE WANTED TO ASK THE GRAHAM GIRLS IF THEY WERE GOING TO A STYLISH RECEPTION BEFORE BREAKFAST

681-152975-0032 IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT ASSOCIATE WITH THE FAMILY THAT HAD CUSTODY OF THE LITTLE BOY IN WHOSE INTERESTS THEY WERE WORKING ANY ATTEMPT ON THEIR PART THEY FELT TO DISCUSS SOCIETY
681-152975-0033 FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE GRAHAM GIRLS MUST RESULT IN A BETRAYAL OF THEIR UTTER LACK OF SYMPATHY WITH THIS SOCIAL INDISPENSABILITY OF SUCH HELPLESS SOCIETY VICTIMS
