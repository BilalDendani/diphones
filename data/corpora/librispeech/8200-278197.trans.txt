8200-278197-0000 AS I RUN MY FINGERS THROUGH THE PAGES OF THE LIMP MOROCCO COVERED VOLUME I ALMOST WONDER AT MY WASTED LABOUR THE RANDOM NOTES JOTTED DOWN NOW AND THEN SOMETIMES WITH LONG INTERVALS BETWEEN THEIR DATES MAKE SUCH A MASS OF WORTHLESS LITERATURE
8200-278197-0001 THIS DIARY KEEPING IS A VERY FOOLISH HABIT AFTER ALL WHY DO I KEEP THIS RECORD OF A MOST COMMONPLACE EXISTENCE FOR MY OWN EDIFICATION AND IMPROVEMENT
8200-278197-0002 SCARCELY SINCE I VERY RARELY READ THESE UNINTERESTING ENTRIES AND I VERY MUCH DOUBT IF POSTERITY WILL CARE TO KNOW THAT I WENT TO THE OFFICE AT TEN O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY MORNING THAT I COULDN'T GET A SEAT IN THE OMNIBUS AND WAS COMPELLED TO TAKE A HANSOM WHICH COST ME TWO SHILLINGS
8200-278197-0003 THAT I DINED TETE A TETE WITH MY MOTHER AND FINISHED THE THIRD VOLUME OF CARLYLE'S FRENCH REVOLUTION IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING IS THERE ANY USE IN SUCH A JOURNAL AS MINE WILL THE CELEBRATED NEW ZEALANDER THAT IS TO BE DISCOVER THE VOLUMES AMIDST THE RUINS OF CLAPHAM
8200-278197-0004 AND SHALL I BE QUOTED AS THE PEPYS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY BUT THEN I AM BY NO MEANS AS RACY AS THAT WORLDLY MINDED LITTLE GOVERNMENT CLERK OR PERHAPS IT MAY BE THAT THE TIME IN WHICH I LIVE
8200-278197-0005 WANTS THE SPICE AND SEASONING OF THAT GOLDEN AGE OF RASCALITY IN WHICH MY LADY CASTLEMAIN'S WHITE PETTICOATS WERE TO BE SEEN FLAUNTING IN THE WIND BY ANY FRIVOLOUS MINDED LOUNGER WHO CHOSE TO TAKE NOTES ABOUT THOSE GARMENTS AFTER ALL IT IS A SILLY OLD FOGEYISH HABIT THIS OF DIARY KEEPING
8200-278197-0006 AND I THINK THE RENOWNED PEPYS HIMSELF WAS ONLY A BACHELOR SPOILED JUST NOW HOWEVER I HAVE SOMETHING MORE THAN CAB DRIVES LOST OMNIBUSES AND THE PERUSAL OF A FAVOURITE BOOK TO JOT DOWN INASMUCH AS MY MOTHER AND MYSELF HAVE LATELY HAD ALL OUR ACCUSTOMED HABITS
8200-278197-0007 IN A MANNER DISORGANIZED BY THE ADVENT OF A LADY SHE IS A VERY YOUNG LADY BEING IN POINT OF FACT STILL AT A REMOTE DISTANCE FROM AN EPOCH TO WHICH SHE APPEARS TO LOOK FORWARD AS A GRAND AND ENVIABLE PERIOD OF EXISTENCE
8200-278197-0008 SHE HAS NOT YET ENTERED WHAT SHE CALLS HER TEENS AND TWO YEARS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE SHE CAN ENTER THEM AS SHE IS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE IS THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF MY ONLY SISTER MARIAN LESTER AND HAS BEEN NEWLY IMPORTED FROM SYDNEY
8200-278197-0009 WHERE MY SISTER MARIAN AND HER HUSBAND HAVE BEEN SETTLED FOR THE LAST TWELVE YEARS MISS ELIZABETH LESTER BECAME A MEMBER OF OUR FAMILY UPON THE FIRST OF JULY AND HAS SINCE THAT TIME CONTINUED TO MAKE HERSELF QUITE AT HOME WITH MY MOTHER AND MYSELF
8200-278197-0010 AND NON PIU MESTA BRINGS ME TO ANOTHER STRANGE FIGURE IN THE NARROW CIRCLE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE
8200-278197-0011 AND THE SOUND OF THE MELODY BRINGS BEFORE ME THE IMAGE OF A SWEET PALE FACE AND DOVE LIKE BROWN EYES I NEVER FULLY REALIZED THE NUMBER AND EXTENT OF FEMININE REQUIREMENTS UNTIL A HACK CAB DEPOSITED MY NIECE AND HER DEAL TRAVELLING CASES AT OUR HALL DOOR
8200-278197-0012 MISS ELIZABETH LESTER SEEMED TO WANT EVERYTHING THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THE HUMAN MIND TO IMAGINE OR DESIRE SHE HAD GROWN DURING THE HOMEWARD VOYAGE HER FROCKS WERE TOO SHORT
8200-278197-0013 HER BOOTS WERE TOO SMALL HER BONNETS TUMBLED OFF HER HEAD AND HUNG FORLORNLY AT THE BACK OF HER NECK SHE WANTED PARASOLS AND HAIR BRUSHES FRILLED AND FURBELOWED MYSTERIES OF MUSLIN AND LACE COPYBOOKS PENHOLDERS AND POMATUM
8200-278197-0014 A BACKBOARD AND A PAIR OF GLOVES DRAWING PENCILS DUMB BELLS GEOLOGICAL SPECIMENS FOR THE ILLUSTRATION OF HER STUDIES AND A HUNDRED OTHER ITEMS WHOSE VERY NAMES ARE AS A STRANGE LANGUAGE TO MY MASCULINE COMPREHENSION
8200-278197-0015 AND LAST OF ALL SHE WANTED A MUSICAL GOVERNESS
8200-278197-0016 THE LITTLE GIRL WAS SUPPOSED TO BE VERY TOLERABLY ADVANCED IN HER STUDY OF THE PIANO AND MY SISTER WAS ANXIOUS THAT SHE SHOULD CONTINUE THAT STUDY UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF A DULY QUALIFIED INSTRUCTRESS WHOSE TERMS SHOULD BE MODERATE
8200-278197-0017 MY SISTER MARIAN UNDERLINED THIS LAST CONDITION THE BUYING AND MAKING OF THE NEW FROCKS AND MUSLIN FURBELOWS SEEMED ALMOST TO ABSORB MY MOTHER'S MIND AND SHE WAS FAIN TO DELEGATE TO ME THE DUTY OF FINDING A MUSICAL GOVERNESS FOR MISS LESTER
8200-278197-0018 I BEGAN MY TASK IN THE SIMPLEST POSSIBLE WAY BY CONSULTING THE DAILY NEWSPAPERS WHERE I FOUND SO MANY ADVERTISEMENTS EMANATING FROM LADIES WHO DECLARED THEMSELVES PROFICIENTS IN THE ART OF MUSIC
8200-278197-0019 THAT I WAS CONFUSED AND EMBARRASSED BY THE WEALTH OF MY RESOURCES BUT I TOOK THE LADIES SINGLY AND CALLED UPON THEM IN THE PLEASANT SUMMER EVENINGS AFTER OFFICE HOURS SOMETIMES WITH MY MOTHER SOMETIMES ALONE
8200-278197-0020 IT MAY BE THAT THE SEAL OF OLD BACHELORHOOD IS ALREADY SET UPON ME AND THAT I AM THAT ODIOUS AND HYPER SENSITIVE CREATURE COMMONLY CALLED A FIDGET
8200-278197-0021 ONE YOUNG LADY DECLARED THAT SHE WAS FONDER OF MUSIC THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD SOME WERE A GREAT DEAL TOO ENTHUSIASTIC AND WERE PREPARED TO ADORE MY LITTLE NIECE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE
8200-278197-0022 MANY WHO SEEMED OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE DEMANDED A HIGHER RATE OF REMUNERATION THAN WE WERE PREPARED TO GIVE SO SOMEHOW OR OTHER THE BUSINESS LANGUISHED AND AFTER THE RESEARCHES OF A WEEK
8200-278197-0023 HAD OUR RESOURCES BEEN REDUCED WE SHOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE BEEN MUCH EASIER TO PLEASE BUT MY MOTHER SAID THAT AS THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE TO BE HAD WE SHOULD DO WELL TO DELIBERATE BEFORE WE CAME TO ANY DECISION
8200-278197-0024 SO IT HAPPENED THAT WHEN I WENT OUT FOR A WALK ONE EVENING AT THE END OF THE SECOND WEEK IN JULY MISS LESTER WAS STILL WITHOUT A GOVERNESS
8200-278197-0025 SHE WAS STILL WITHOUT A GOVERNESS BUT I WAS TIRED OF CATECHIZING THE FAIR ADVERTISERS AS TO THEIR QUALIFICATIONS AND WENT OUT ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING FOR A SOLITARY RAMBLE AMONGST THE QUIET SURREY SUBURBS
8200-278197-0026 IT WAS A LOVELY EVENING
8200-278197-0027 SET MY FACE TOWARDS THE YELLOW LIGHT IN THE WEST AND WALKED ACROSS WANDSWORTH COMMON
8200-278197-0028 WANDSWORTH COMMON WAS AS LONELY THIS EVENING AS A PATCH OF SAND IN THE CENTRE OF AFRICA AND BEING SOMETHING OF A DAY DREAMER I LIKED THE PLACE BECAUSE OF ITS STILLNESS AND SOLITUDE SOMETHING OF A DREAMER
8200-278197-0029 I KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT OF AS I WENT HOME IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THE NEWLY RISEN MOON THE PALE CRESCENT THAT GLIMMERED HIGH IN A CLOUDLESS HEAVEN
8200-278197-0030 I WENT INTO THE LITTLE TOWN OF WANDSWORTH THE QUEER OLD FASHIONED HIGH STREET THE DEAR OLD STREET WHICH SEEMS TO ME LIKE A TOWN IN A DUTCH PICTURE WHERE ALL THE TINTS ARE OF A SOMBRE BROWN
8200-278197-0031 YET IN WHICH THERE IS NEVERTHELESS SO MUCH LIGHT AND WARMTH THE LIGHTS WERE BEGINNING TO TWINKLE HERE AND THERE IN THE WINDOWS AND UPON THIS JULY EVENING THERE SEEMED TO BE FLOWERS BLOOMING IN EVERY CASEMENT
8200-278197-0032 WHAT COULD I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT EVENING AND HOW WAS IT THAT I DID NOT THINK THE WORLD BLANK AND EMPTY WHILE I WAS LOOKING IDLY IN AT ONE OF THOSE SHOP WINDOWS IT WAS A FANCY SHOP AND STATIONER'S A KIND OF BAZAAR IN ITS HUMBLE WAY
8200-278197-0033 MY EYE WAS ATTRACTED BY THE WORD MUSIC AND ON A LITTLE CARD HUNG IN THE WINDOW I READ THAT A LADY WOULD BE HAPPY TO GIVE LESSONS ON THE PIANO FORTE AT THE RESIDENCES OF HER PUPILS OR AT HER OWN RESIDENCE ON VERY MODERATE TERMS
8200-278197-0034 THE WORD VERY WAS UNDERSCORED I THOUGHT IT HAD A PITIFUL LOOK SOMEHOW THAT UNDERSCORING OF THE ADVERB
8200-278197-0035 THE INSCRIPTION ON THE CARD WAS IN A WOMAN'S HAND AND A VERY PRETTY HAND ELEGANT BUT NOT ILLEGIBLE FIRM AND YET FEMININE I WAS IN A VERY IDLE FRAME OF MIND READY TO BE DRIVEN BY ANY CHANCE WIND
8200-278197-0036 AND I THOUGHT I MIGHT JUST AS WELL TURN MY EVENING WALK TO SOME ACCOUNT BY CALLING UPON THE PROPRIETRESS OF THE CARD
8200-278197-0037 ANY MORE THAN THE OTHER LADIES I HAD SEEN BUT I SHOULD AT LEAST BE ABLE TO RETURN HOME WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING MADE ANOTHER EFFORT TO FIND AN INSTRUCTRESS FOR MY NIECE
8200-278197-0038 AND WAS TOLD TO TAKE THE SECOND TURNING ON MY RIGHT THE SECOND TURNING ON MY RIGHT TOOK ME INTO A KIND OF LANE OR BY ROAD WHERE THERE WERE SOME OLD FASHIONED SEMI DETACHED COTTAGES SHELTERED BY A ROW OF SYCAMORES AND SHUT IN BY WOODEN PALINGS
8200-278197-0039 I OPENED THE LOW GATE BEFORE THE THIRD COTTAGE AND WENT INTO THE GARDEN A PRIMLY KEPT LITTLE GARDEN WITH A GRASS PLAT AND MINIATURE GRAVEL WALKS AND WITH A GROTTO OF SHELLS AND MOSS AND CRAGGY BLOCKS OF STONE IN A CORNER
8200-278197-0040 I SAW THIS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY FOR THE BRIGHT COLOUR FADED OUT OF HER FACE WHILE I WAS SPEAKING TO HER I HAVE COME TO INQUIRE FOR A LADY WHO TEACHES MUSIC I SAID I SAW A CARD JUST NOW IN THE HIGH STREET AND AS I AM SEARCHING FOR AN INSTRUCTRESS FOR MY LITTLE NIECE
8200-278197-0041 I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF CALLING BUT I FEAR I HAVE CHOSEN AN INCONVENIENT TIME FOR MY VISIT I SCARCELY KNOW WHY I MADE THIS APOLOGY SINCE I HAD OMITTED TO APOLOGIZE TO THE OTHER LADIES ON WHOM I HAD VENTURED TO INTRUDE AT ABNORMAL HOURS
8200-278197-0042 I FEAR THAT I WAS WEAK ENOUGH TO FEEL BEWILDERED BY THE PENSIVE LOVELINESS OF THE FACE AT WHICH I LOOKED AND THAT MY CONFIDENCE EBBED AWAY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THOSE GRAVE HAZEL EYES
8200-278197-0043 AND WHEN DO I NOT THINK OF HER SHALL I DESCRIBE HER FOR THE NEW ZEALANDER WHEN THE BEST DESCRIPTION MUST FALL SO FAR BELOW THE BRIGHT REALITY AND WHEN THE VERY ACT OF REDUCING HER BEAUTY INTO HARD COMMONPLACE WORDS SEEMS IN SOME MANNER A SACRILEGE AGAINST THE SANCTITY OF THAT BEAUTY
8200-278197-0044 YES I WILL DESCRIBE HER NOT FOR THE SAKE OF THE NEW ZEALANDER WHO MAY HAVE NEW AND EXTRAORDINARY IDEAS AS TO FEMALE LOVELINESS AND MAY REQUIRE A BLUE NOSE OR PEA GREEN TRESSES IN THE LADY HE ELECTS AS THE ONLY TYPE OF BEAUTIFUL WOMANHOOD
8200-278197-0045 I WILL DESCRIBE HER BECAUSE IT IS SWEET TO ME TO DWELL UPON HER IMAGE AND TO TRANSLATE THAT DEAR IMAGE NO MATTER HOW POORLY INTO WORDS
8200-278197-0046 WERE I A POET I SHOULD COVER REAMS OF PAPER WITH WILD RHAPSODIES ABOUT HER BEAUTY BEING ONLY A CASHIER IN A BANK I CAN DO NOTHING BUT ENSHRINE HER IN THE COMMONPLACE PAGES OF MY DIARY I HAVE SAID THAT SHE IS PALE
8200-278197-0047 HERS IS THAT IVORY PALLOR WHICH SOMETIMES ACCOMPANIES HAZEL EYES AND HAZEL BROWN HAIR HER EYES ARE OF THAT RARE HAZEL THAT SOFT GOLDEN BROWN SO RARELY SEEN SO BEAUTIFUL WHEREVER THEY ARE SEEN
8200-278197-0048 THESE EYES ARE UNVARYING IN THEIR COLOUR IT IS ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THEM THAT VARIES WITH EVERY EMOTION BUT IN REPOSE THEY HAVE A MOURNFUL EARNESTNESS IN THEIR LOOK A PENSIVE GRAVITY THAT SEEMS TO TELL OF A LIFE IN WHICH THERE HAS BEEN MUCH SHADOW
8200-278197-0049 THE HAIR PARTED ABOVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BROW I EVER LOOKED UPON IS OF EXACTLY THE SAME COLOUR AS THE EYES AND HAS A NATURAL RIPPLE IN IT
8200-278197-0050 FOR THE REST OF THE FEATURES I MUST REFER MY NEW ZEALANDER TO THE PICTURES OF THE OLD ITALIAN MASTERS OF WHICH I TRUST HE MAY RETAIN A HANDSOME COLLECTION FOR ONLY ON THE CANVASES OF SIGNORI RAFFAELLO SANZIO D'URBINO TITIAN AND THE PUPILS WHO EMULATED THEM
8200-278197-0051 WILL HE FIND THAT EXQUISITE HARMONY THAT PURITY OF FORM AND TENDER SOFTNESS OF OUTLINE WHICH I BEHELD THAT SUMMER EVENING IN THE FEATURES OF MARGARET WENTWORTH MARGARET WENTWORTH THAT IS HER NAME
8200-278197-0052 IN SOME AWKWARD VAGUE MANNER WHO I WAS AND HOW IT WAS I WANTED TO ENGAGE HER SERVICES THROUGHOUT THAT INTERVIEW I THINK I MUST HAVE BEEN INTOXICATED BY HER PRESENCE AS BY SOME SUBTLE AND MYSTERIOUS INFLUENCE STRONGER THAN THE FUMES OF OPIUM OR THE JUICE OF LOTUS FLOWERS
8200-278197-0053 I ONLY KNOW THAT AFTER TEN MINUTES CONVERSATION DURING WHICH SHE WAS PERFECTLY SELF POSSESSED I OPENED THE LITTLE GARDEN GATE AGAIN
8200-278197-0054 AND WENT BACK OUT OF THAT LITTLE PARADISE OF TWENTY FEET SQUARE INTO THE DUSTY LANE I WENT HOME IN TRIUMPH TO MY MOTHER AND TOLD HER THAT I HAD SUCCEEDED AT LAST IN ENGAGING A LADY WHO WAS IN EVERY WAY SUITABLE
8200-278197-0055 AND THAT SHE WAS COMING THE FOLLOWING MORNING AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK TO GIVE HER FIRST LESSON BUT I WAS SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED WHEN MY MOTHER ASKED IF I HAD HEARD THE LADY PLAY IF I HAD INQUIRED HER TERMS
8200-278197-0056 IF I HAD ASKED FOR REFERENCES AS TO RESPECTABILITY CAPABILITY AND SO FORTH I WAS FAIN TO CONFESS WITH MUCH CONFUSION THAT I HAD NOT DONE ANY ONE OF THESE THINGS
8200-278197-0057 AND THEN MY MOTHER ASKED ME WHY IN THAT CASE DID I CONSIDER THE LADY SUITABLE WHICH QUESTION INCREASED MY EMBARRASSMENT BY TENFOLD
8200-278197-0058 NOR COULD I DECLARE THAT I HAD JUDGED OF HER PROFICIENCY AS A TEACHER OF THE PIANO BY THE EXQUISITE LINE OF HER PENCILLED EYEBROWS SO IN THIS DILEMMA I HAD RECOURSE TO A PIECE OF JESUITRY OF WHICH I WAS NOT A LITTLE PROUD
8200-278197-0059 I TOLD MY DEAR MOTHER THAT MISS WENTWORTH'S HEAD WAS FROM A PHRENOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW MAGNIFICENT AND THAT THE ORGANS OF TIME AND TUNE WERE DEVELOPED TO AN UNUSUAL DEGREE
8200-278197-0060 I WAS ALMOST ASHAMED OF MYSELF WHEN MY MOTHER REWARDED THIS FALSEHOOD BY A KISS DECLARING THAT I WAS A DEAR CLEVER BOY AND SUCH A JUDGE OF CHARACTER AND THAT SHE WOULD RATHER CONFIDE IN A STRANGER UPON THE STRENGTH OF MY INSTINCT
8200-278197-0061 THAN UPON ANY INFERIOR PERSON'S EXPERIENCE AFTER THIS I COULD ONLY TRUST TO THE CHANCE OF MISS WENTWORTH'S PROFICIENCY AND WHEN I WENT HOME FROM THE CITY UPON THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON
8200-278197-0062 MY MIND WAS FAR LESS OCCUPIED WITH THE BUSINESS EVENTS OF THE DAY THAN WITH ABSTRUSE SPECULATIONS AT TO THE PROBABILITIES WITH REGARD TO THAT YOUNG LADY'S SKILL UPON THE PIANO FORTE
8200-278197-0063 IT WAS WITH AN AIR OF SUPREME CARELESSNESS THAT I ASKED MY MOTHER WHETHER SHE HAD BEEN PLEASED WITH MISS WENTWORTH PLEASED WITH HER CRIED THE GOOD SOUL WHY SHE PLAYS MAGNIFICENTLY CLEMENT
8200-278197-0064 SUCH A TOUCH SUCH BRILLIANCY IN MY YOUNG DAYS IT WAS ONLY CONCERT PLAYERS WHO PLAYED LIKE THAT BUT NOWADAYS GIRLS OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY SIT DOWN AND DASH AWAY AT THE KEYS LIKE A PROFESSOR
8200-278197-0065 I THINK YOU'LL BE CHARMED WITH HER CLEM' I'M AFRAID I BLUSHED AS MY MOTHER SAID THIS HAD I NOT BEEN CHARMED WITH HER ALREADY
8200-278197-0066 SHE IS PASSIONATELY FOND OF MUSIC I KNOW NOT BECAUSE SHE WENT INTO ANY RIDICULOUS SENTIMENTAL RAPTURES ABOUT IT AS SOME GIRLS DO BUT BECAUSE HER EYES LIGHTED UP WHEN SHE TOLD ME WHAT A HAPPINESS HER PIANO
8200-278197-0067 HAD BEEN TO HER EVER SINCE SHE WAS A CHILD SHE GAVE A LITTLE SIGH AFTER SAYING THAT AND I FANCIED POOR GIRL THAT SHE HAD PERHAPS KNOWN VERY LITTLE OTHER HAPPINESS AND HER TERMS MOTHER I SAID
8200-278197-0068 HEAVEN BLESS HER INNOCENT HEART
8200-278197-0069 BUT I'M AFRAID YOU'LL THINK IT AN OBJECTION I EAGERLY ASKED THE NATURE OF THIS OBJECTION WAS THERE SOME COLD CHILL OF DISAPPOINTMENT IN STORE FOR ME AFTER ALL
8200-278197-0070 WELL YOU SEE CLEM SAID MY MOTHER WITH SOME LITTLE HESITATION MISS WENTWORTH IS ENGAGED ALMOST ALL THROUGH THE DAY AS HER PUPILS LIVE AT LONG DISTANCES FROM ONE ANOTHER
8200-278197-0071 SO THE ONLY TIME SHE CAN POSSIBLY GIVE LIZZIE IS EITHER VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING OR RATHER LATE IN THE EVENING NOW I SHOULD PREFER THE EVENING AS I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR THE DEAR CHILD'S LESSONS
8200-278197-0072 BUT THE QUESTION IS WOULD YOU OBJECT TO THE NOISE OF THE PIANO WHILE YOU ARE AT HOME WOULD I OBJECT WOULD I OBJECT TO THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES
8200-278197-0073 IN SPITE OF THE GRAND CAPABILITIES FOR FALSEHOOD AND HYPOCRISY WHICH HAD BEEN DEVELOPED IN MY NATURE SINCE THE PREVIOUS EVENING IT WAS AS MUCH AS I COULD DO TO ANSWER MY MOTHER'S QUESTION DELIBERATELY TO THE EFFECT THAT I DIDN'T THINK I SHOULD MIND THE MUSIC LESSONS
8200-278197-0074 MUCH YOU'LL BE OUT GENERALLY YOU KNOW CLEM MY MOTHER SAID YES I REPLIED OF COURSE IF I FOUND THE MUSIC IN ANY WAY A NUISANCE
8200-278197-0075 COMING HOME FROM THE CITY THE NEXT DAY I FELT LIKE A SCHOOLBOY WHO TURNS HIS BACK UPON ALL THE HARDSHIPS OF HIS LIFE ON SOME SUNNY SUMMER HOLIDAY THE RATTLING HANSOM SEEMED A FAIRY CAR THAT WAS BEARING ME IN TRIUMPH THROUGH A REGION OF BRIGHTNESS AND SPLENDOUR
8200-278197-0076 THE SUNLIT SUBURBAN ROADS WERE ENCHANTED GLADES AND I THINK I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SCARCELY SURPRISED TO SEE ALADDIN'S JEWELLED FRUIT HANGING ON THE TREES IN THE VILLA GARDENS OR THE GIGANTIC WINGS OF SINBAD'S ROC OVERSHADOWING THE HILLS OF SYDENHAM
8200-278197-0077 OH WAS I IN LOVE WAS I REALLY IN LOVE AT LAST WITH A YOUNG LADY WHOSE FACE I HAD ONLY LOOKED UPON EIGHT AND FORTY HOURS BEFORE WAS I WHO HAD FLIRTED WITH THE MISS BALDERBYS AND HALF LOST MY HEART TO LUCY SEDWICKE THE SURGEON'S SISTER
8200-278197-0078 ONLY TO BE JILTED IGNOMINIOUSLY FOR THE SAKE OF AN EVANGELICAL CURATE
8200-278197-0079 I HAVE ONE OF MISS CARPENTER'S LONG TRESSES IN THE DESK ON WHICH I AM WRITING SEALED IN A SHEET OF LETTER PAPER WITH SWIFT'S SAVAGE INSCRIPTION ONLY A WOMAN'S HAIR ON THE COVER
8200-278197-0080 I WAS ASHAMED OF MY SILLY FANCY IN ONE MOMENT AND PROUD OF MY LOVE IN THE NEXT I WAS TEN YEARS YOUNGER ALL OF A SUDDEN AND MY HEART WAS ALL A GLOW WITH CHIVALROUS DEVOTION FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL STRANGER
8200-278197-0081 I REASONED WITH MYSELF AND RIDICULED MY MADNESS AND YET YIELDED LIKE THE VERIEST CRAVEN TO THE SWEET INTOXICATION I GAVE THE DRIVER OF THE HANSOM FIVE SHILLINGS
8200-278197-0082 HAD I NOT A RIGHT TO PAY HIM A TRIFLE EXTRA FOR DRIVING ME THROUGH FAIRY LAND WHAT HAD WE FOR DINNER THAT DAY
8200-278197-0083 I KNOW THAT THE MEAL SEEMED TO ENDURE FOR THE ABNORMAL PERIOD OF HALF A DOZEN HOURS OR SO AND YET IT WAS ONLY SEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN WE ADJOURNED TO THE DRAWING ROOM AND MISS WENTWORTH WAS NOT DUE UNTIL HALF PAST SEVEN
8200-278197-0084 MY NIECE WAS ALL IN A FLUTTER OF EXPECTATION AND RAN OUT OF THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOW EVERY NOW AND THEN TO SEE IF THE NEW GOVERNESS WAS COMING SHE NEED NOT HAVE HAD THAT TROUBLE POOR CHILD HAD I BEEN INCLINED TO GIVE HER INFORMATION SINCE
8200-278197-0085 FROM THE CHAIR IN WHICH I HAD SEATED MYSELF TO READ THE EVENING PAPERS I COULD SEE THE ROAD ALONG WHICH MISS WENTWORTH MUST COME MY EYES WANDERED VERY OFTEN FROM THE PAGE BEFORE ME AND FIXED THEMSELVES UPON THIS DUSTY SUBURBAN ROAD AND PRESENTLY I SAW A PARASOL
8200-278197-0086 AND THEN A SLENDER FIGURE COMING QUICKLY TOWARDS OUR GATE AND THEN THE FACE WHICH I AM WEAK ENOUGH TO THINK THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FACE IN CHRISTENDOM
8200-278197-0087 SINCE THEN MISS WENTWORTH HAS COME THREE TIMES A WEEK AND SOMEHOW OR OTHER I HAVE NEVER FOUND MYSELF IN ANY WAY BORED BY NON PIU MESTA OR EVEN THE MAJOR AND MINOR SCALES WHICH AS INTERPRETED BY A JUVENILE PERFORMER
8200-278197-0088 ARE NOT ESPECIALLY ENTHRALLING TO THE EAR OF THE ORDINARY LISTENER I READ MY BOOKS OR PAPERS OR STROLL UPON THE LAWN WHILE THE LESSON IS GOING ON AND EVERY NOW AND THEN I HEAR MARGARET'S
8200-278197-0089 I REALLY MUST WRITE OF HER AS MARGARET IT IS SUCH A NUISANCE TO WRITE MISS WENTWORTH PRETTY VOICE EXPLAINING THE IMPORTANCE OF A STEADY POSITION OF THE WRIST OR THE DEXTEROUS TURNING OVER OR UNDER OF A THUMB OR SOMETHING EQUALLY INTERESTING
8200-278197-0090 AND THEN WHEN THE LESSON IS CONCLUDED MY MOTHER ROUSES HERSELF FROM HER AFTER DINNER NAP AND ASKS MARGARET TO TAKE A CUP OF TEA AND EVEN INSISTS ON HER ACCEPTING THAT FEMININE HOSPITALITY
8200-278197-0091 AND THEN WE SIT TALKING IN THE TENDER SUMMER DUSK OR IN THE SUBDUED LIGHT OF A SHADED LAMP ON THE PIANO WE TALK OF BOOKS AND IT IS WONDERFUL TO ME TO FIND HOW MARGARET'S TASTES AND OPINIONS COINCIDE WITH MINE
8200-278197-0092 MISS CARPENTER WAS STUPID ABOUT BOOKS AND USED TO CALL CARLYLE NONSENSICAL AND NEVER REALLY ENJOYED DICKENS HALF AS MUCH AS SHE PRETENDED
8200-278197-0093 I HAVE LENT MARGARET SOME OF MY BOOKS AND A LITTLE SHOWER OF WITHERED ROSE LEAVES DROPPED FROM THE PAGES OF WILHELM MEISTER AFTER SHE HAD RETURNED ME THE VOLUME I HAVE PUT THEM IN AN ENVELOPE AND SEALED IT
8200-278197-0094 FARTHER THAN EVER PERHAPS FROM UNDERSTANDING EACH OTHER BUT WITH MARGARET I NEED NO WORDS TO TELL ME THAT I AM UNDERSTOOD A LOOK A SMILE A MOVEMENT OF THE GRACEFUL HEAD IS A MORE ELOQUENT ANSWER THAN THE MOST ELABORATE OF MISS CARPENTER'S RHAPSODIES
8200-278197-0095 SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE GIRLS WHOM HER FRIENDS CALL GUSHING AND SHE CALLED BYRON A LOVE AND SHELLEY AN ANGEL BUT IF YOU TRIED HER WITH A STANZA THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE TO DEATH IN GEMS OF VERSE OR STRINGS OF POETIC PEARLS
8200-278197-0096 OR DRAWING ROOM TABLE LYRICS SHE COULDN'T TELL WHETHER YOU WERE QUOTING BYRON OR BEN JONSON BUT WITH MARGARET MARGARET SWEET NAME IF IT WERE NOT THAT I LIVE IN PERPETUAL TERROR OF THE DAY WHEN THE DILETTANTE NEW ZEALANDER WILL EDIT THIS MANUSCRIPT
8200-278197-0097 I THINK I SHOULD WRITE THAT LOVELY NAME OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR A PAGE OR SO IF THE NEW ZEALANDER SHOULD EXERCISE HIS EDITORIAL DISCRETION AND DELETE MY RAPTURES IT WOULDN'T MATTER
8200-278197-0098 BUT I MIGHT FURNISH HIM WITH THE TEXT FOR AN ELABORATE DISQUISITION ON THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF ENGLISH LOVERS LET ME BE REASONABLE ABOUT MY DEAR LOVE IF I CAN MY DEAR LOVE
8200-278197-0099 WE SEEM TO BE OLD FRIENDS AND YET I KNOW SO LITTLE OF HER SHE SHUNS ALL ALLUSION TO HER HOME OR HER PAST HISTORY NOW AND THEN SHE HAS SPOKEN OF HER FATHER ALWAYS TENDERLY BUT ALWAYS WITH A SIGH
8200-278197-0100 AND I FANCY THAT A DEEPENING SHADOW STEALS OVER HER FACE WHEN SHE MENTIONS THAT NAME FRIENDLY AS WE ARE I CAN NEVER INDUCE HER TO LET ME SEE HER HOME THOUGH MY MOTHER HAS SUGGESTED THAT I SHOULD DO SO
8200-278197-0101 SHE IS ACCUSTOMED TO GO ABOUT BY HERSELF SHE SAYS AFTER DARK AS WELL AS IN THE DAYTIME
