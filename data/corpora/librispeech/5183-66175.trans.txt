5183-66175-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE WINTER AT RIVERMOUTH
5183-66175-0001 ONE BLEAK DECEMBER MORNING CASTING A PECULIARLY NAUTICAL GLANCE SKYWARD
5183-66175-0002 SOMEHOW NEVER TURNED OUT ACCORDING TO HIS PREDICTION THE VANES ON THE CHURCH STEEPLES SEEMED TO TAKE FIENDISH PLEASURE IN HUMILIATING THE DEAR OLD GENTLEMAN IF HE SAID IT WAS GOING TO BE A CLEAR DAY A DENSE SEA FOG WAS
5183-66175-0003 PRETTY CERTAIN TO SET IN BEFORE NOON ONCE HE CAUSED A PROTRACTED DROUGHT BY ASSURING US EVERY MORNING FOR SIX CONSECUTIVE WEEKS
5183-66175-0004 BY THIS NATURAL PHENOMENON MY DELIGHT AND SURPRISE WERE AS BOUNDLESS AS IF THE HEAVY GRAY SKY HAD LET DOWN A SHOWER OF POND LILIES AND WHITE ROSES INSTEAD OF SNOW FLAKES
5183-66175-0005 IT HAPPENED TO BE A HALF HOLIDAY SO I HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT WATCH THE FEATHERY CRYSTALS WHIRLING HITHER AND THITHER THROUGH THE AIR I STOOD BY THE SITTING ROOM WINDOW GAZING AT THE WONDER
5183-66175-0006 BUT THIS WAS A REGULAR NOR'EASTER SEVERAL INCHES OF SNOW HAD ALREADY FALLEN THE ROSE BUSHES AT THE DOOR DROOPED WITH THE WEIGHT OF THEIR MAGICAL BLOSSOMS AND THE TWO POSTS THAT HELD THE GARDEN GATE WERE
5183-66175-0007 WITH WHITE TURBANS GUARDING THE ENTRANCE TO THE NUTTER HOUSE
5183-66175-0008 CONTINUED WITH UNABATED VIOLENCE THROUGH THE NIGHT
5183-66175-0009 THE SUN WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY THE CLOUDLESS HEAVENS WORE THE TENDER AZURE OF JUNE AND THE WHOLE EARTH LAY MUFFLED UP TO THE EYES AS IT WERE IN A THICK MANTLE OF MILK WHITE DOWN
5183-66175-0010 IT WAS A VERY DEEP SNOW THE OLDEST INHABITANT
5183-66175-0011 WITHOUT ITS OLDEST INHABITANT OVERHAULED HIS ALMANACS AND PRONOUNCED IT THE DEEPEST SNOW WE HAD HAD FOR TWENTY YEARS
5183-66175-0012 OUR STREET WAS A SIGHT TO BE SEEN OR RATHER IT WAS A SIGHT NOT TO BE SEEN FOR VERY LITTLE STREET WAS VISIBLE
5183-66175-0013 HALF COVERED MY BEDROOM WINDOW THERE WAS NO SCHOOL THAT DAY FOR ALL THE THOROUGHFARES WERE IMPASSABLE BY TWELVE O'CLOCK HOWEVER THE GREAT SNOWPLOUGHS EACH DRAWN BY FOUR YOKES OF OXEN
5183-66175-0014 BROKE A WAGON PATH THROUGH THE PRINCIPAL STREETS BUT THE FOOT PASSENGERS HAD A HARD TIME OF IT FLOUNDERING IN THE ARCTIC DRIFTS THE CAPTAIN AND I CUT A TUNNEL THREE FEET WIDE AND SIX FEET HIGH
5183-66175-0015 FROM OUR FRONT DOOR TO THE SIDEWALK OPPOSITE IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL CAVERN WITH ITS WALLS AND ROOF INLAID WITH MOTHER OF PEARL AND DIAMONDS I AM SURE THE ICE PALACE OF THE RUSSIAN EMPRESS
5183-66175-0016 SHORTLY BEFORE SUNSET AND WE HAD THE BITTEREST COLD NIGHT I EVER EXPERIENCED THIS BROUGHT OUT THE OLDEST INHABITANT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY AND WHAT A GAY OLD BOY HE WAS FOR DECIDING EVERYTHING
5183-66175-0017 OUR TUNNEL WAS TURNED INTO SOLID ICE A CRUST THICK ENOUGH TO BEAR MEN AND HORSES HAD FORMED OVER THE SNOW EVERYWHERE AND THE AIR WAS ALIVE WITH MERRY SLEIGH BELLS ICY STALACTITES A YARD LONG
5183-66175-0018 BUNG FROM THE EAVES OF THE HOUSE AND THE TURKISH SENTINELS AT THE GATE
5183-66175-0019 SO THE WINTER SET IN COLD AND GLITTERING EVERYTHING OUT OF DOORS WAS SHEATHED IN SILVER MAIL TO QUOTE FROM CHARLEY MARDEN IT WAS COLD ENOUGH TO FREEZE THE TAIL OFF A BRASS MONKEY
5183-66175-0020 AN OBSERVATION WHICH SEEMED TO ME EXTREMELY HAPPY THOUGH I KNEW LITTLE OR NOTHING CONCERNING THE ENDURANCE OF BRASS MONKEYS HAVING NEVER SEEN ONE I HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THE ADVENT OF THE SEASON WITH GRAVE APPREHENSIONS
5183-66175-0021 DREARY NIGHTS AND MONOTONOUS DAYS
5183-66175-0022 SKATING ON THE MILL POND COASTING BY MOONLIGHT LONG RIDES BEHIND GYPSY IN A BRAND NEW LITTLE SLEIGH BUILT EXPRESSLY FOR HER WERE SPORTS NO LESS EXHILARATING
5183-66175-0023 THAN THOSE WHICH BELONGED TO THE SUNNY MONTHS AND THEN THANKSGIVING
5183-66175-0024 WHY SHOULDN'T MEMORY HAVE A NOSE DILATES WITH PLEASURE OVER THE RICH PERFUME OF MISS ABIGAIL'S FORTY MINCE PIES
5183-66175-0025 LIKE THE SULTAN'S FORTY WIVES CHRISTMAS WAS ANOTHER RED LETTER DAY THOUGH IT WAS NOT SO GENERALLY OBSERVED IN NEW ENGLAND AS IT IS NOW
5183-66175-0026 SLEET TAPPED AGAINST THE WINDOW PANES
5183-66175-0027 A DISH OF APPLES AND A PITCHER OF CHILLY CIDER WERE ALWAYS SERVED DURING THE EVENING THE CAPTAIN HAD A
5183-66175-0028 SOMETIMES I PLAYED DOMINOS WITH HIM AND SOMETIMES MISS ABIGAIL READ ALOUD TO US PRONOUNCING TO
5183-66175-0029 IN A FORMER CHAPTER I ALLUDED TO MISS ABIGAIL'S MANAGING PROPENSITIES SHE HAD AFFECTED MANY CHANGES IN THE NUTTER HOUSE BEFORE I CAME THERE TO LIVE
5183-66175-0030 SHE HAD LONG CONTENDED WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO OVERCOME
5183-66175-0031 ON FIRST TAKING COMMAND OF THE HOUSEHOLD SHE PROHIBITED SMOKING IN THE SITTING ROOM WHERE IT HAD BEEN THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S CUSTOM
5183-66175-0032 GUILTY CREATURE IN THE BARN OR ABOUT THE GARDENS
5183-66175-0033 BUT IN WINTER THE CAPTAIN WAS HARD PUT TO IT WHEN HE COULDN'T STAND IT LONGER HE RETREATED TO HIS BEDROOM AND BARRICADED THE DOOR SUCH WAS THE POSITION OF AFFAIRS AT THE TIME OF WHICH I WRITE
5183-66175-0034 ONE MORNING A FEW DAYS AFTER THE GREAT SNOW AS MISS ABIGAIL WAS DUSTING THE CHRONOMETER IN THE BALL SHE BEHELD CAPTAIN NUTTER SLOWLY DESCENDING THE STAIRCASE WITH A LONG CLAY PIPE IN HIS MOUTH
5183-66175-0035 HEAVILY ON THE HAT RACK THE TONE OF REPROACH WITH WHICH THIS WORD WAS UTTERED FAILED TO PRODUCE THE SLIGHTEST EFFECT ON THE CAPTAIN WHO MERELY REMOVED THE PIPE FROM HIS LIPS FOR AN INSTANT AND
5183-66175-0036 BLEW A CLOUD INTO THE CHILLY AIR THE THERMOMETER STOOD AT TWO DEGREES BELOW ZERO IN OUR HALL DAN'EL CRIED MISS ABIGAIL HYSTERICALLY DAN'EL DON'T COME NEAR ME
5183-66175-0037 WHEREUPON SHE FAINTED AWAY FOR THE SMELL OF TOBACCO SMOKE ALWAYS MADE HER DEADLY SICK KITTY COLLINS RUSHED FROM THE KITCHEN WITH A BASIN OF WATER AND SET TO WORK BATHING MISS ABIGAIL'S TEMPLES AND CHAFING HER HANDS
5183-66175-0038 I THOUGHT MY GRANDFATHER RATHER CRUEL
5183-66175-0039 COMPLACENTLY WATCHING MISS ABIGAIL'S SUFFERINGS WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO THE CAPTAIN SAT DOWN BESIDE HER AND WITH A LOVELY TWINKLE IN HIS EYE SAID SOFTLY ABIGAIL MY DEAR
5183-66175-0040 THERE WASN'T ANY TOBACCO IN THAT PIPE
5183-66175-0041 CRASH TOWEL STUFFED INTO HER MOUTH
5183-66175-0042 PARTIALLY REMOVING THE CLOTH AND THEN
5183-66175-0043 WITH MIRTH FOR MANY A DAY AS TO MISS ABIGAIL I THINK SHE NEVER WHOLLY PARDONED HIM AFTER THIS CAPTAIN NUTTER GRADUALLY GAVE UP SMOKING WHICH IS AN UNTIDY INJURIOUS DISGRACEFUL AND HIGHLY PLEASANT HABIT
5183-66175-0044 A BOY'S LIFE IN A SECLUDED NEW ENGLAND TOWN IN WINTER DOES NOT AFFORD MANY POINTS FOR ILLUSTRATION OF COURSE HE GETS HIS EARS OR TOES FROST BITTEN OF COURSE HE SMASHES HIS SLED AGAINST ANOTHER BOY'S OF COURSE
5183-66175-0045 HE'S A LAD OF NO ENTERPRISE WHATEVER IF HE DOESN'T MANAGE TO SKATE INTO AN EEL HOLE
