4863-258982-0000 ONE THE TASK OF THE ENTERPRISER IS TO GET TOGETHER THE ESSENTIAL FACTORS TO SECURE VALUABLE PRODUCTS THE ENTERPRISER MUST FIRST DECIDE WHAT PRODUCT HE WILL ENDEAVOR TO SECURE AND THE KIND THE PLACE THE TIME THE QUANTITY
4863-258982-0001 AND THE QUALITY HE MUST THEN SELECT IN THE RIGHT PROPORTION THE MATERIALS LABOR PLANT AND MACHINERY NECESSARY FOR THAT PRODUCT HE MUST PURCHASE THESE FACTORS IN THE MARKET AT THE LOWEST PRICE HE CAN UNITE THEM AND SELL THE PRODUCT
4863-258982-0002 TO RECOVER THE EXPENSES IN THE SELLING PRICE A THOUSAND ITEMS ENTER INTO THE COST AND PERHAPS A SINGLE PRODUCT EMERGES WHAT THE BUSINESS MAN THUS PAYS OUT EXPRESSED IN MONEY FORM
4863-258982-0003 TWO THE TERM COST OF PRODUCTION IS USED IN SEVERAL SENSES THE CHIEF OF WHICH ARE MONEY COST PSYCHIC COST AND ALTERNATIVE COST THE AMBIGUITY OF THIS TERM IS A SOURCE OF MUCH CONFUSION PSYCHIC COST IS THE PAIN FATIGUE
4863-258982-0004 EXCEPT AT RARE POINTS WHEN THE PAIN OF WORK
4863-258982-0005 THE WORKER WHO IS FREE TO DETERMINE THE LENGTH OF HIS OWN WORKING DAY STOPS AT THAT POINT
4863-258982-0006 ARE ALMOST EQUAL IN INTENSITY THE ONE AS A POSITIVE THE OTHER AS A NEGATIVE QUANTITY
4863-258982-0007 CANNOT BE RELATED TO THE PSYCHIC COST OR SACRIFICE AND THEREFORE IT CANNOT SERVE AS A MEASURE OF COST IN EVERY DAY BUSINESS ALTERNATIVE COST IS ANY GOOD OR GRATIFICATION THAT MUST BE GIVEN UP WHEN ANY OTHER GOOD IS CHOSEN
4863-258982-0008 ONE MAY STAY AT HOME AND READ A BOOK OR GO ON A PICNIC THE PLEASURE OF READING THE BOOK WILL COST THE PLEASURE OF THE PICNIC A GOOD DRESS MAY COST A HAPPY VACATION THAT MUST BE GIVEN UP FOR IT IN THIS SENSE
4863-258982-0009 EACH THING IS A COST OF EVERY OTHER THING THAT MIGHT BE CHOSEN IN THE PLACE OF IT ALTERNATIVE COST IS THEREFORE MANIFOLD AND INDEFINITE THE THOUGHT IS SIGNIFICANT AT THE MOMENT OF A CHOICE BUT IT IS NOT CONSTANTLY MEASURABLE FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES
4863-258982-0010 THE MONEY COST IS THE PRACTICAL COST GENERALLY IMPLIED IN THE TERM COST OF PRODUCTION IT EXPRESSES NOT THE PAIN OF THE LABORER IN DOING THE WORK NOT THE SACRIFICE OF THE OWNER OF THE CAPITAL IN SAVING THE MONEY BUT MERELY
4863-258982-0011 THE SUM OF MONEY PAID OUT BY THE PRODUCER THERE IS FREQUENT CONFUSION OF THESE IDEAS IN ECONOMIC DISCUSSION FEW EVEN OF THE LEADING ECONOMISTS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
4863-258982-0012 THREE THE ENTERPRISER LOOKING UPON THE COST OF MOST OF THE FACTORS AS FIXED SEEKS TO COMBINE THEM AS ECONOMICALLY AS POSSIBLE WHETHER THE ENTERPRISER IS RUNNING A FACTORY OR A FARM IS ENGAGED IN A RETAIL OR A WHOLESALE STORE
4863-258982-0013 BUYING AT A BETTER TIME AND JUDGING BETTER THAN HIS COMPETITORS THE QUALITY OF GOODS IF IN A GIVEN MARKET AT A GIVEN TIME GOODS ARE SOLD TO ONE MORE CHEAPLY THAN TO OTHERS IT IS AN ACT OF GENEROSITY
4863-258982-0014 THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ENTERPRISERS ARE NOT FOUND TO BE THOSE PAYING LOWER WAGES
4863-258982-0015 THAT THE MAIN FORCES FIXING THE PRICES OF AGENTS ARE IMPERSONAL AND CAN BE ONLY SLIGHTLY MODIFIED IN MOST CASES
4863-258982-0016 HE LOOKS THEREFORE UPON THE COST OF THE ELEMENTS AS AN ULTIMATE FACT WHICH HE CAN CHANGE LITTLE IF AT ALL AND HE SHOWS HIS JUDGMENT CHIEFLY IN THE SELECTION OF QUALITY COST DETERMINES AND LIMITS THE EXTENT OF HIS BUSINESS
4863-258982-0017 FOUR THE RIGHT PROPORTIONING AND SKILFUL SUBSTITUTION OF THE FACTORS IS A DELICATE TECHNICAL TASK FOR THE ENTERPRISER GOOD BUYING AND GOOD SELLING MUST PRECEDE AND FOLLOW THE CENTRAL PART OF THE ENTERPRISER'S TASK
4863-258982-0018 THAT IS THE COMBINING OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS EACH FACTOR IS APPLIED SUBJECT TO DIMINISHING RETURNS UP TO A POINT
4863-258982-0019 THE ENTERPRISER IS CONSTANTLY STUDYING THE QUESTION WHETHER THE APPLICATION OF ANOTHER UNIT OF ANY ONE FACTOR AT THE PRICE WILL ADD TO THE VALUE OF THE PRODUCT AS MUCH OR MORE THAN THE COST
4863-258982-0020 THIS CALCULATION IS MADE FOR EVERY ONE OF THE MINOR FACTORS ENTERING INTO THE BUSINESS AND FOR THE BUSINESS AS A WHOLE THE PROPER PROPORTION VARIES AT DIFFERENT PRICES OR COSTS IF WAGES RISE IT PAYS TO GET MACHINERY IF WAGES FALL
4863-258982-0021 IT PAYS TO LET THE MACHINERY DETERIORATE AND TO DO MORE BY HAND LABOR LIKEWISE THERE IS CONSTANT SUBSTITUTION OF THE VARIOUS MATERIALS THE RIGHT PROPORTIONS CHANGE CONSTANTLY WITH INVENTIONS A MODEL FACTORY IS SO PROPORTIONED
4863-258982-0022 THAT THE BUILDINGS HOLD THE RIGHT NUMBER OF MACHINES WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF SPACE FOR THE WORKMEN AND THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF POWER IF THERE IS MORE OF A SINGLE FACTOR THAN THE IDEAL PROPORTION IT IS AN UNNECESSARY COST EVEN THE MODEL FACTORY BEGINS TO BE OUT OF DATE
4863-258982-0023 ALMOST AS SOON AS THE WALLS ARE DRY AND THE LATEST METHOD IS TO BUILD AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE ON THE UNIT SYSTEM SO THAT NEW PARTS MAY BE ADDED
4863-258982-0024 FIVE THE ENTERPRISER'S COSTS DETERMINE THE LOWEST PRICE AT WHICH HE CAN CONTINUE TO SELL BUT IF SUCCESSFUL HE MAY HAVE A WIDE MARGIN OF PROFITS NEW FACTORIES ARE CONSTANTLY ARISING WITH NEW AND BETTER ADJUSTMENTS
4863-258982-0025 IN INDUSTRIES OF COMPETING PRODUCTS
4863-258982-0026 HENCE THERE IS ALWAYS A PRESSURE OF COMPETITION ON SOME ENTERPRISERS WHO CONSTANTLY COMPLAIN THAT THEY MUST SELL BELOW THE COST OF PRODUCTION THE ORGANIZERS OF A TRUST ALWAYS DECLARE SOME NO DOUBT TRULY
4863-258982-0027 BUSINESS MEN SAY THAT COMPETITION IS DESTRUCTIVE AND IT CERTAINLY DOES DESTROY THE LESS FAVORABLY SITUATED ENTERPRISES EACH ENTERPRISER'S PRICE IS THE HIGHEST HE CAN GET IN THE MARKET FOR HIS PRODUCT IT MAY FAR EXCEED HIS COSTS
4863-258982-0028 IT MAY EVEN FALL BELOW THEM BUT ONLY TEMPORARILY
4863-258982-0029 THE SHERIFF SOON CLOSES THE DOORS SUCCESSFUL COMPETITORS ARE CONSTANTLY PRESSING UPON THE MARGINAL ENTERPRISER FIXING A PRICE THAT LEAVES THEMSELVES A PROFIT BUT IS BELOW HIS COST EVEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ENTERPRISER
4863-258982-0030 COMES INTO CONTACT WITH COST AND SEEMS TO BE COMPELLED BY IT HE REACHES OUT FOR TRADE AND SELLS SOME NOT ALL GOODS AT A PRICE WHICH LEAVES HIM NO PROFIT HE ENLARGES HIS FACTORY AND SHIPS GOODS FARTHER PAYING THE FREIGHT
4863-258982-0031 THE EXPANDING BUSINESS THEREFORE COMES AT LENGTH TO THE POINT
4863-258982-0032 HENCE THE BUSINESS MAN'S VIEW OF THE COSTS IS THAT THEY DETERMINE VALUE IT IS TRUE IN THE SENSE THAT THE SUPPLY OF A PARTICULAR PRODUCT IN ANY MARKET IS AT LAST LIMITED BY COST OF MARGINAL PRODUCERS OR OF MARGINAL PORTIONS OF SUPPLY
4863-258982-0033 BUT IT IS NOT TRUE OF ALL THE UNITS OF PRODUCT THAT COSTS DETERMINE OR EQUAL MARKET PRICE THERE IS A MARGIN ABOVE COSTS TO THE SUCCESSFUL ENTERPRISER ON A LARGE PORTION OF HIS OUTPUT THE MARGIN MAY BE NARROW OR WIDE
4863-258982-0034 AND NOT THE REVERSE THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE BUSINESS MAN IS DECEIVED INTO THE BELIEF THAT HE HAS IN COST OF PRODUCTION A FINAL EXPLANATION OF VALUE
4863-258982-0035 A MARVELOUS RECOGNITION AND ANALYSIS OF THE MOST DISTANT INFLUENCES IS NECESSARY BUT IN GENERAL A SUPERFICIAL VIEW OF VALUE IS TAKEN IN BUSINESS IT DOES NOT PAY TO DO OTHER
4863-258982-0036 THE LOGICAL TREATMENT HOWEVER MUST GO DEEPER INTO THE QUESTION AND TRACE THE COST OF AGENTS BACK TO THE ULTIMATE CAUSE OF VALUE THAT IS TO WANT GRATIFYING POWER TO SAY THAT THE PRICE OF A PRODUCT IS DETERMINED
4863-258982-0037 BY THE MONEY COST OR PRICE OF THE FACTORS IS SIMPLY TO POSTPONE THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF VALUE ONE HAS STILL TO ASK
4863-258982-0038 IN ALTERNATIVE USES TWO THE DEMAND FOR ANY FACTOR ENTERING INTO PRODUCTS IS REFLECTED IN AN INCREASED PRICE TO ITS COST IN ALL COMPETING PRODUCTS FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING
4863-258982-0039 PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER FOR THE FACTORS THAT ENTER INTO THEM ACCORDING TO LOCATION QUALITY OF THE SOIL AND IMPROVEMENTS A CERTAIN AREA OF LAND HAS VARIOUS RIVAL USES THESE USES BID FOR THE LAND
4863-258982-0040 IF FINE WINE CAN BE RAISED ON A PIECE OF LAND POTATOES ORDINARILY WILL NOT BE PLANTED IN IT BUT IF THERE IS SUCH A SUPPLY OF THAT QUALITY OF LAND THAT IT CONTINUES TO BE USED SIDE BY SIDE FOR BOTH PRODUCTS IT WILL HAVE THE SAME VALUE
4863-258982-0041 AND YIELD THE SAME RENTAL IN BOTH USES THE LEAST UTILITY YIELDED BY ANY PORTION OF THE SUPPLY FIXES THE VALUE OF ALL THE UNITS MACHINES ARE USUALLY MADE FOR SOME PRODUCT DETERMINED IN ADVANCE
4863-258982-0042 BUT OFTEN THEY ARE ONLY PARTIALLY SPECIALIZED AND WITHIN LIMITS THEY CAN BE ADAPTED SEWING MACHINE FACTORIES WERE READILY TURNED TO THE MAKING OF BICYCLES AT THE TIME OF GREATEST DEMAND AND BICYCLE FACTORIES LATER WERE USED FOR THE MAKING OF AUTOMOBILES
4863-258982-0043 THUS IN GENERAL MACHINERY IS USED FOR THE PRODUCT TO WHICH IT CONTRIBUTES THE MOST VALUE ANY ENTERPRISER SEEKING IT FOR ANY OTHER USE FINDS ITS COST AFFECTED BY ITS VARIOUS ALTERNATIVE USES THE SAME IS TRUE OF ALL THE MATERIALS
4863-258982-0044 AND OF ALL THE GRADES OF LABOR ENTERING INTO PRODUCTS THE ENTERPRISER'S COST IS THEREFORE THE REFLECTION OF THE WANT GRATIFYING POWER OF THE PRODUCTIVE AGENT IN ALL ITS OTHER USES AS WELL AS IN THE PARTICULAR PRODUCT HE DESIRES TO THE ENTERPRISER
4863-258982-0045 COST SEEMS THE CAUSE OF THE VALUE OF A PRODUCT TO THE ECONOMIST
4863-258982-0046 IS THE BASIS OF VALUE IN THE FACTORS
4863-258982-0047 THREE THE GENEALOGY OF VALUE MAY THUS BE TRACED THROUGH THE VARIOUS INTERMEDIATE PRODUCTS TO CONSUMPTION GOODS A SINGLE PRODUCT HAVING A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY SHOWS MOST CLEARLY THE REFLECTION OF VALUE
4863-258982-0048 DIRECTLY FROM THE PRODUCT THE DISCOVERY OF A MINERAL SPRING OR OF A GOOD QUALITY OF BUILDING STONE ON WORTHLESS LAND WILL CAUSE A VALUE TO ATTACH AT ONCE TO THE SOURCE OF SUPPLY WHEN A GREAT SINGER LIKE ADELINA PATTI
4863-258982-0049 COMMANDS SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH APPEARANCE IN CONCERT THE SOURCE IS THE MAGICAL THROAT OF THE SINGER
4863-258982-0050 WHEN THE ONE SOURCE OF SUPPLY YIELDS SEVERAL DIFFERENT KINDS OF PRODUCTS THERE IS JUST ONE NEW CONDITION WHICH CONFUSES THE THOUGHT AND SUGGESTS THE ERROR THAT VALUE BEGINS IN THE SOURCE WITH COSTS THEREFORE AND NOT IN THE PRODUCT
4863-258982-0051 LOOKING AT THE PRODUCTS SEVERALLY NO ONE OF THEM EXPLAINS THE VALUE OF THE SOURCE AND ON THE CONTRARY EACH ONE IS SEEN TO HAVE A VALUE INDEPENDENT OF THE PARTICULAR USE TO WHICH IT IS PUT TO MAKE THE ILLUSTRATION MOST SIMPLE
4863-258982-0052 A SAVAGE FINDS IN A WRECK ON THE COAST
4863-258982-0053 HIS FELLOWS WISH THEM FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES TO MAKE ARROW HEADS SPEARS KNIVES HATCHETS HOES ORNAMENTS NAILS NEEDLES ET CETERA VALUE IS IN THIS CASE DERIVED IN PART THROUGH THE SOURCE
4863-258982-0054 FROM THE ALTERNATE USES TAKEN JOINTLY AND CONSIDERED AS ONE SUM THE VALUE OF THE VARIOUS PRODUCTS ACCOUNTS AS COMPLETELY AND EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE VALUE OF THE SOURCE AS IF THEY WERE MERGED INTO ONE PRODUCT THE SOURCE S
4863-258982-0055 IS DISTRIBUTED TO EACH OF THE PRODUCTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR MARGINAL UTILITY
4863-258982-0056 FROM ANY SOURCE OF SUPPLY CONSTANTLY TENDS TO EQUALITY ANY UNIT OF PRODUCT SOUGHT FOR ANY PURPOSE MUST BE PAID FOR ACCORDING TO A MARGINAL UTILITY DETERMINED IN ALL THE APPLICATIONS
4863-258982-0057 A SINGLE PRODUCT TWO
4863-258982-0058 WITH INTERMEDIATE PRODUCTS IN ACTUAL LIFE THE PROBLEM IS FAR MORE COMPLEX AND YET THROUGH ITS SETTLEMENT RUNS JUST THE SAME PRINCIPLE THERE IS CONSTANT BIDDING FOR MATERIALS AND THROUGH THEIR PRICE
4863-258982-0059 THE CLAIMS OF RIVAL PRODUCTS ARE ADJUSTED A POINT IS REACHED
4863-258982-0060 THE PRODUCTION OF ANOTHER UNIT RESULTS IN A LOSS THERE IS A MOST COMPLEX RELATION AMONG MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES USING THE SAME FACTORS THE VALUE OF A UNIT OF PRODUCT AT A BEING REFLECTED UP TO THE SOURCE
4863-258982-0061 AND THROUGH SUCCESSIVE LINKS TO THE MOST DISTANT PRODUCT Z THE EFFECT OF THIS IS TO REDUCE THE SALE OF Z AND CORRESPONDINGLY THE USE MADE OF THE AGENT IN QUESTION A HIGHER PRICE OF LEATHER DUE TO THE INCREASED USE OF SHOES
4863-258982-0062 RAISES THE VALUE OF HIDES AND CATTLE THIS INCREASING THE EXTENT OF CATTLE RAISING AND RAISES THUS THE COST OF CARRIAGE TRIMMINGS POCKET BOOKS FOOT BALLS LEATHER BELTS AND EVERY OTHER LEATHER PRODUCT AS THE PRICE RISES
4863-258982-0063 SUBSTITUTES FOR LEATHER AND IMITATIONS OF IT ARE USED FOR SUCH OF THE PRODUCTS
4863-258982-0064 BUT IS THE MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH CONSUMERS EXPRESS THEIR ESTIMATES
4863-258982-0065 AND SATISFIES THE PUBLIC TASTE IS THE GOOD MEDIUM HE READILY TRANSMITS AND ACCURATELY FOCUSES THE RAYS OF PUBLIC JUDGMENT ONE THAT MISJUDGES IS A POOR MEDIUM THE ENTERPRISER IS HIMSELF THE SERVANT OF COSTS
4863-258982-0066 LABORERS SOMETIMES ASSUME THAT THE EMPLOYER CAN DICTATE WAGES PRICES AND MARKETS CAN RULE THINGS WITH A LORDLY HAND WITH RARE EXCEPTIONS THE ULTIMATE CONTROL IN THESE MATTERS BY BUSINESS MEN IS VERY SLIGHT
4863-258982-0067 IN THE MAIN THE ENTERPRISER MASTERS THE SITUATION ONLY BY BOWING TO IT JUST AS THE SCIENTIST AND THE ENGINEER GAIN MASTERY OVER NATURE BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHEN TO BEND AND HOW TO OBEY THE CONSUMER
4863-258982-0068 BY DECIDING TO BUY THIS OR THAT PRODUCT SETS IN MOTION WAVES OF VALUE THE CONSUMERS OF PRODUCTS ARE THE TRUE PURCHASERS OF LABOR MATERIALS AND USES OF AGENTS
4863-258982-0069 TO THE PRICE PREVAILING FOR THE MOMENT OR HIS COMPETITORS IN THIS DAY OF NARROW MARGINS WILL SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY
