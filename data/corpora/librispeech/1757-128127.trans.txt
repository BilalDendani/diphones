1757-128127-0000 AND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BE AT ONCE DIDACTIC AND DELIGHTFUL BUT LADY BELLAIRS MANAGES VERY CLEVERLY TO STEER A MIDDLE COURSE BETWEEN THE CHARYBDIS OF DULNESS AND THE SCYLLA OF FLIPPANCY
1757-128127-0001 AND ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT SHE SAYS HAS BOTH GOOD SENSE AND GOOD HUMOUR TO RECOMMEND IT NOR DOES SHE CONFINE HERSELF TO THOSE BROAD GENERALISATIONS ON MORALS
1757-128127-0002 SUDDEN EXCLAMATIONS OF ANNOYANCE SURPRISE OR JOY
1757-128127-0003 YAWNING WHEN LISTENING TO ANY ONE TALKING ON FAMILY MATTERS EVEN TO YOUR BOSOM FRIENDS ATTEMPTING ANY VOCAL OR INSTRUMENTAL PIECE OF MUSIC THAT YOU CANNOT EXECUTE WITH EASE CROSSING YOUR LETTERS
1757-128127-0004 MAKING A SHORT SHARP NOD WITH THE HEAD INTENDED TO DO DUTY FOR A BOW ALL NONSENSE IN THE SHAPE OF BELIEF IN DREAMS OMENS PRESENTIMENTS
1757-128127-0005 AND WILD FLIGHTS OF THE IMAGINATION ARE SO EXTREMELY RARE IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THAT THEY SEEM TO ME DESERVING RATHER OF PRAISE THAN OF CENSURE THE EXCLAMATION BOTHER ALSO THOUGH CERTAINLY LACKING IN BEAUTY
1757-128127-0006 MIGHT I THINK BE PERMITTED UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF EXTREME AGGRAVATION SUCH AS FOR INSTANCE THE REJECTION OF A MANUSCRIPT BY THE EDITOR OF A MAGAZINE BUT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS THE LIST SEEMS TO BE QUITE EXCELLENT AS FOR WHAT TO CULTIVATE NOTHING COULD BE BETTER THAN THE FOLLOWING
1757-128127-0007 THE ART OF PLEASING THOSE AROUND YOU AND SEEMING PLEASED WITH THEM AND ALL THEY MAY DO FOR YOU THE CHARM OF MAKING LITTLE SACRIFICES QUITE NATURALLY AS IF OF NO ACCOUNT TO YOURSELF
1757-128127-0008 THE HABIT OF MAKING ALLOWANCES FOR THE OPINIONS FEELINGS OR PREJUDICES OF OTHERS AN ERECT CARRIAGE THAT IS A SOUND BODY A GOOD MEMORY FOR FACES AND FACTS CONNECTED WITH THEM THUS AVOIDING GIVING OFFENCE
1757-128127-0009 THROUGH NOT RECOGNISING OR BOWING TO PEOPLE OR SAYING TO THEM WHAT HAD BEST BEEN LEFT UNSAID THE ART OF LISTENING WITHOUT IMPATIENCE TO PROSY TALKERS AND SMILING AT THE TWICE TOLD TALE OR JOKE
1757-128127-0010 I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT THE LAST APHORISM AIMS AT TOO HIGH A STANDARD THERE IS ALWAYS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DANGER IN ANY ATTEMPT TO CULTIVATE IMPOSSIBLE VIRTUES
1757-128127-0011 HOWEVER IT IS ONLY FAIR TO ADD THAT LADY BELLAIRS RECOGNISES THE IMPORTANCE OF SELF DEVELOPMENT QUITE AS MUCH AS THE IMPORTANCE OF SELF DENIAL AND THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF SOUND SENSE IN EVERYTHING THAT SHE SAYS ABOUT THE GRADUAL GROWTH AND FORMATION OF CHARACTER INDEED
1757-128127-0012 THOSE WHO HAVE NOT READ ARISTOTLE UPON THIS POINT MIGHT WITH ADVANTAGE READ LADY BELLAIRS MISS CONSTANCE NADEN'S LITTLE VOLUME A MODERN APOSTLE AND OTHER POEMS SHOWS BOTH CULTURE AND COURAGE
1757-128127-0013 CULTURE IN ITS USE OF LANGUAGE COURAGE IN ITS SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER THE MODERN APOSTLE OF WHOM MISS NADEN SINGS IS A YOUNG CLERGYMAN WHO PREACHES PANTHEISTIC SOCIALISM IN THE FREE CHURCH OF SOME PROVINCIAL MANUFACTURING TOWN CONVERTS EVERYBODY EXCEPT THE WOMAN WHOM HE LOVES
1757-128127-0014 AND IS KILLED IN A STREET RIOT THE STORY IS EXCEEDINGLY POWERFUL BUT SEEMS MORE SUITABLE FOR PROSE THAN FOR VERSE IT IS RIGHT THAT A POET SHOULD BE FULL OF THE SPIRIT OF HIS AGE BUT THE EXTERNAL FORMS OF MODERN LIFE ARE HARDLY AS YET EXPRESSIVE OF THAT SPIRIT
1757-128127-0015 THEY ARE TRUTHS OF FACT NOT TRUTHS OF THE IMAGINATION AND THOUGH THEY MAY GIVE THE POET AN OPPORTUNITY FOR REALISM THEY OFTEN ROB THE POEM OF THE REALITY THAT IS SO ESSENTIAL TO IT ART HOWEVER IS A MATTER OF RESULT NOT OF THEORY AND IF THE FRUIT IS PLEASANT
1757-128127-0016 WE SHOULD NOT QUARREL ABOUT THE TREE MISS NADEN'S WORK IS DISTINGUISHED BY RICH IMAGERY FINE COLOUR AND SWEET MUSIC AND THESE ARE THINGS FOR WHICH WE SHOULD BE GRATEFUL WHEREVER WE FIND THEM IN POINT OF MERE TECHNICAL SKILL HER LONGER POEMS ARE THE BEST
1757-128127-0017 BUT SOME OF THE SHORTER POEMS ARE VERY FASCINATING THIS FOR INSTANCE IS PRETTY THE COPYIST GROUP WAS GATHERED ROUND A TIME WORN FRESCO WORLD RENOWNED WHOSE CENTRAL GLORY ONCE HAD BEEN THE FACE OF CHRIST THE NAZARENE
1757-128127-0018 AND EVERY COPYIST OF THE CROWD WITH HIS OWN SOUL THAT FACE ENDOWED GENTLE SEVERE MAJESTIC MEAN BUT WHICH WAS CHRIST THE NAZARENE THEN ONE WHO WATCHED THEM MADE COMPLAINT AND MARVELLED SAYING
1757-128127-0019 WHEREFORE PAINT TILL YE BE SURE YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN THE FACE OF CHRIST THE NAZARENE AND THIS SONNET IS FULL OF SUGGESTION THE WINE FLUSHED MONARCH SLEPT BUT IN HIS EAR AN ANGEL BREATHED
1757-128127-0020 IN DREAD HE WOKE BUT NOT IN SHAME DEEP MUSING
1757-128127-0021 WHEREFORE HE LEFT HIS FEASTS AND MINIONS DEAR AND JUSTLY RULED AND DIED A SAINT IN NAME BUT WHEN HIS HASTING SPIRIT HEAVENWARD CAME A STERN VOICE CRIED
1757-128127-0022 LOVE I FORSWORE AND WINE AND KEPT MY VOW TO LIVE A JUST AND JOYLESS LIFE AND NOW I CRAVE REWARD THE VOICE CAME LIKE A KNELL FOOL DOST THOU HOPE TO FIND AGAIN THY MIRTH AND THOSE FOUL JOYS THOU DIDST RENOUNCE ON EARTH YEA ENTER IN
1757-128127-0023 MY HEAVEN SHALL BE THY HELL MISS CONSTANCE NADEN DESERVES A HIGH PLACE AMONG OUR LIVING POETESSES AND THIS AS MISSUS SHARP HAS SHOWN LATELY IN HER VOLUME ENTITLED WOMEN'S VOICES IS NO MEAN DISTINCTION
1757-128127-0024 PHYLLIS BROWNE'S LIFE OF MISSUS SOMERVILLE FORMS PART OF A VERY INTERESTING LITTLE SERIES CALLED THE WORLD'S WORKERS' A COLLECTION OF SHORT BIOGRAPHIES CATHOLIC ENOUGH TO INCLUDE PERSONALITIES
1757-128127-0025 SO WIDELY DIFFERENT AS TURNER AND RICHARD COBDEN HANDEL AND SIR TITUS SALT ROBERT STEPHENSON AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE AND YET POSSESSING A CERTAIN DEFINITE AIM AS A MATHEMATICIAN AND A SCIENTIST THE TRANSLATOR AND POPULARISER OF LA MECANIQUE CELESTE
1757-128127-0026 AND THE AUTHOR OF AN IMPORTANT BOOK ON PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY MISSUS SOMERVILLE IS OF COURSE WELL KNOWN THE SCIENTIFIC BODIES OF EUROPE COVERED HER WITH HONOURS HER BUST STANDS IN THE HALL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND ONE OF THE WOMEN'S COLLEGES AT OXFORD BEARS HER NAME
1757-128127-0027 AND THOSE WHO CONSIDER THAT STUPIDITY IS THE PROPER BASIS FOR THE DOMESTIC VIRTUES AND THAT INTELLECTUAL WOMEN MUST OF NECESSITY BE HELPLESS WITH THEIR HANDS CANNOT DO BETTER THAN READ PHYLLIS BROWNE'S PLEASANT LITTLE BOOK
1757-128127-0028 IN WHICH THEY WILL FIND THAT THE GREATEST WOMAN MATHEMATICIAN OF ANY AGE WAS A CLEVER NEEDLEWOMAN A GOOD HOUSEKEEPER AND A MOST SKILFUL COOK INDEED MISSUS SOMERVILLE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN QUITE RENOWNED FOR HER COOKERY
1757-128127-0029 NOT AS A TRIBUTE TO THE DISTINGUISHED MATHEMATICIAN BUT AS A RECOGNITION OF THE EXCELLENCE OF SOME ORANGE MARMALADE WHICH THE DISTINGUISHED MATHEMATICIAN HAD PREPARED WITH HER OWN HANDS AND PRESENTED TO THE SHIPS BEFORE THEY LEFT ENGLAND
1757-128127-0030 AND TO THE FACT THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO MAKE CURRANT JELLY AT A VERY CRITICAL MOMENT SHE OWED THE AFFECTION OF SOME OF HER HUSBAND'S RELATIVES WHO UP TO THAT TIME HAD BEEN RATHER PREJUDICED AGAINST HER ON THE GROUND THAT SHE WAS MERELY AN UNPRACTICAL BLUE STOCKING
1757-128127-0031 NOR DID HER SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE EVER WARP OR DULL THE TENDERNESS AND HUMANITY OF HER NATURE FOR BIRDS AND ANIMALS SHE HAD ALWAYS A GREAT LOVE WE HEAR OF HER AS A LITTLE GIRL WATCHING WITH EAGER EYES THE SWALLOWS AS THEY BUILT THEIR NESTS IN SUMMER
1757-128127-0032 OR PREPARED FOR THEIR FLIGHT IN THE AUTUMN AND WHEN SNOW WAS ON THE GROUND SHE USED TO OPEN THE WINDOWS TO LET THE ROBINS HOP IN AND PICK CRUMBS ON THE BREAKFAST TABLE ON ONE OCCASION SHE WENT WITH HER FATHER ON A TOUR IN THE HIGHLANDS AND FOUND ON HER RETURN THAT A PET GOLDFINCH
1757-128127-0033 HAD BEEN NEGLECTED BY THEM AND HAD DIED OF STARVATION SHE WAS ALMOST HEART BROKEN AT THE EVENT AND IN WRITING HER RECOLLECTIONS SEVENTY YEARS AFTER
1757-128127-0034 ONE DAY THE SPARROW FELL INTO THE WATER JUG AND WAS DROWNED TO THE GREAT GRIEF OF ITS MISTRESS WHO COULD HARDLY BE CONSOLED FOR ITS LOSS
1757-128127-0035 AND BECOMING MISSUS SOMERVILLE'S CONSTANT COMPANION SHE WAS ALSO VERY ENERGETIC PHYLLIS BROWNE TELLS US IN TRYING TO GET A LAW PASSED IN THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT FOR THE PROTECTION OF ANIMALS AND SAID ONCE WITH REFERENCE TO THIS SUBJECT
1757-128127-0036 WE ENGLISH CANNOT BOAST OF HUMANITY SO LONG AS OUR SPORTSMEN FIND PLEASURE IN SHOOTING DOWN TAME PIGEONS AS THEY FLY TERRIFIED OUT OF A CAGE' A REMARK WITH WHICH I ENTIRELY AGREE MISTER HERBERT'S BILL FOR THE PROTECTION OF LAND BIRDS GAVE HER IMMENSE PLEASURE
1757-128127-0037 THOUGH TO QUOTE HER OWN WORDS SHE WAS GRIEVED TO FIND THAT THE LARK WHICH AT HEAVEN'S GATE SINGS IS THOUGHT UNWORTHY OF MAN'S PROTECTION AND SHE TOOK A GREAT FANCY TO A GENTLEMAN WHO ON BEING TOLD OF THE NUMBER OF SINGING BIRDS THAT IS EATEN IN ITALY
1757-128127-0038 NIGHTINGALES GOLDFINCHES AND ROBINS EXCLAIMED IN HORROR
1757-128127-0039 INDEED SHE BELIEVED TO SOME EXTENT IN THE IMMORTALITY OF ANIMALS ON THE GROUND THAT IF ANIMALS HAVE NO FUTURE IT WOULD SEEM AS IF SOME WERE CREATED FOR UNCOMPENSATED MISERY AN IDEA WHICH DOES NOT SEEM TO ME TO BE EITHER EXTRAVAGANT OR FANTASTIC
1757-128127-0040 THOUGH IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT THE OPTIMISM ON WHICH IT IS BASED RECEIVES ABSOLUTELY NO SUPPORT FROM SCIENCE ON THE WHOLE PHYLLIS BROWNE'S BOOK IS VERY PLEASANT READING ITS ONLY FAULT IS THAT IT IS FAR TOO SHORT AND THIS IS A FAULT SO RARE IN MODERN LITERATURE
1757-128127-0041 THAT IT ALMOST AMOUNTS TO A DISTINCTION HOWEVER PHYLLIS BROWNE HAS MANAGED TO CROWD INTO THE NARROW LIMITS AT HER DISPOSAL A GREAT MANY INTERESTING ANECDOTES
1757-128127-0042 THE PICTURE SHE GIVES OF MISSUS SOMERVILLE WORKING AWAY AT HER TRANSLATION OF LAPLACE IN THE SAME ROOM WITH HER CHILDREN IS VERY CHARMING AND REMINDS ONE OF WHAT IS TOLD OF GEORGE SAND THERE IS AN AMUSING ACCOUNT OF MISSUS SOMERVILLE'S VISIT TO THE WIDOW OF THE YOUNG PRETENDER
1757-128127-0043 THE COUNTESS OF ALBANY WHO AFTER TALKING WITH HER FOR SOME TIME EXCLAIMED SO YOU DON'T SPEAK ITALIAN YOU MUST HAVE HAD A VERY BAD EDUCATION
1757-128127-0044 A VERY AMUSING CIRCUMSTANCE IN CONNECTION WITH MISSUS SOMERVILLE'S ACQUAINTANCE WITH SIR WALTER AROSE OUT OF THE CHILDISH INQUISITIVENESS OF WORONZOW GREIG MISSUS SOMERVILLE'S LITTLE BOY DURING THE TIME MISSUS SOMERVILLE WAS VISITING ABBOTSFORD
1757-128127-0045 THE WAVERLEY NOVELS WERE APPEARING AND WERE CREATING A GREAT SENSATION YET EVEN SCOTT'S INTIMATE FRIENDS DID NOT KNOW THAT HE WAS THE AUTHOR HE ENJOYED KEEPING THE AFFAIR A MYSTERY BUT LITTLE WORONZOW DISCOVERED WHAT HE WAS ABOUT
1757-128127-0046 AND WHEN HE GOES OUT CHARLIE SCOTT AND I READ THE STORIES PHYLLIS BROWNE REMARKS THAT THIS INCIDENT SHOWS THAT PERSONS WHO WANT TO KEEP A SECRET OUGHT TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN CHILDREN ARE ABOUT
1757-128127-0047 BUT THE STORY SEEMS TO ME TO BE FAR TOO CHARMING TO REQUIRE ANY MORAL OF THE KIND BOUND UP IN THE SAME VOLUME IS A LIFE OF MISS MARY CARPENTER ALSO WRITTEN BY PHYLLIS BROWNE MISS CARPENTER DOES NOT SEEM TO ME TO HAVE THE CHARM AND FASCINATION OF MISSUS SOMERVILLE
1757-128127-0048 THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING ABOUT HER THAT IS FORMAL LIMITED AND PRECISE WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT TWO YEARS OLD SHE INSISTED ON BEING CALLED DOCTOR CARPENTER IN THE NURSERY AT THE AGE OF TWELVE SHE IS DESCRIBED BY A FRIEND AS A SEDATE LITTLE GIRL WHO ALWAYS SPOKE LIKE A BOOK
1757-128127-0049 AND BEFORE SHE ENTERED ON HER EDUCATIONAL SCHEMES SHE WROTE DOWN A SOLEMN DEDICATION OF HERSELF TO THE SERVICE OF HUMANITY
1757-128127-0050 AND IT IS NO DOUBT QUITE RIGHT THAT THE SAINTS SHOULD TAKE THEMSELVES VERY SERIOUSLY IT IS ONLY FAIR ALSO TO REMEMBER THAT HER WORK OF RESCUE AND REFORMATION WAS CARRIED ON UNDER GREAT DIFFICULTIES
1757-128127-0051 IN SPITE OF ENDLESS INTERRUPTIONS CAUSED BY SUCH PROCEEDINGS AS SHOOTING MARBLES AT ANY OBJECT BEHIND HER WHISTLING STAMPING FIGHTING SHRIEKING OUT AMEN IN THE MIDDLE OF A PRAYER
1757-128127-0052 DOWN FROM THE GALLERY ROUND THE GREAT SCHOOLROOM AND DOWN THE STAIRS AND INTO THE STREET THESE IRREPRESSIBLE OUTBREAKS SHE BORE WITH INFINITE GOOD HUMOUR
1757-128127-0053 WAS NOT ALWAYS SO BARBAROUS I HAD TAKEN TO MY CLASS ON THE PRECEDING WEEK SOME SPECIMENS OF FERNS NEATLY GUMMED ON WHITE PAPER THIS TIME I TOOK A PIECE OF COAL SHALE WITH IMPRESSIONS OF FERNS TO SHOW THEM
1757-128127-0054 I TOLD EACH TO EXAMINE THE SPECIMEN AND TELL ME WHAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS W GAVE SO BRIGHT A SMILE THAT I SAW HE KNEW NONE OF THE OTHERS COULD TELL HE SAID THEY WERE FERNS LIKE WHAT I SHOWED THEM LAST WEEK BUT HE THOUGHT THEY WERE CHISELLED ON THE STONE
1757-128127-0055 THEIR SURPRISE AND PLEASURE WERE GREAT WHEN I EXPLAINED THE MATTER TO THEM THE HISTORY OF JOSEPH THEY ALL FOUND A DIFFICULTY IN REALISING THAT THIS HAD ACTUALLY OCCURRED ONE ASKED IF EGYPT EXISTED NOW AND IF PEOPLE LIVED IN IT
1757-128127-0056 WHEN I TOLD THEM THAT BUILDINGS NOW STOOD WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED ABOUT THE TIME OF JOSEPH ONE SAID THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AS THEY MUST HAVE FALLEN DOWN ERE THIS I SHOWED THEM THE FORM OF A PYRAMID AND THEY WERE SATISFIED ONE ASKED IF ALL BOOKS WERE TRUE
1757-128127-0057 THE STORY OF MACBETH IMPRESSED THEM VERY MUCH THEY KNEW THE NAME OF SHAKESPEARE HAVING SEEN HIS NAME OVER A PUBLIC HOUSE A BOY DEFINED CONSCIENCE AS A THING A GENTLEMAN HASN'T GOT WHO WHEN A BOY FINDS HIS PURSE AND GIVES IT BACK TO HIM
1757-128127-0058 DOESN'T GIVE THE BOY SIXPENCE ANOTHER BOY WAS ASKED AFTER A SUNDAY EVENING LECTURE ON THANKFULNESS WHAT PLEASURE HE ENJOYED MOST IN THE COURSE OF A YEAR HE REPLIED CANDIDLY COCK FIGHTIN MA'AM THERE'S A PIT UP BY THE BLACK BOY AS IS WORTH ANYTHINK IN BRISSEL
1757-128127-0059 AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO HELP FEELING THAT MISS CARPENTER RATHER OVERESTIMATED THE VALUE OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION THE POOR ARE NOT TO BE FED UPON FACTS
1757-128127-0060 NOR IS THERE MUCH USE IN GIVING THEM THE RESULTS OF CULTURE UNLESS WE ALSO GIVE THEM THOSE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH CULTURE CAN BE REALISED IN THESE COLD CROWDED CITIES OF THE NORTH
1757-128127-0061 THE PROPER BASIS FOR MORALS USING THE WORD IN ITS WIDE HELLENIC SIGNIFICATION IS TO BE FOUND IN ARCHITECTURE
1757-128127-0062 INDEED SHE RATHER INCLINED TO BACON'S OPINION THAT UNMARRIED PEOPLE DO THE BEST PUBLIC WORK IT IS QUITE STRIKING SHE SAYS IN ONE OF HER LETTERS TO OBSERVE HOW MUCH THE USEFUL POWER AND INFLUENCE OF WOMAN HAS DEVELOPED OF LATE YEARS
1757-128127-0063 UNATTACHED LADIES SUCH AS WIDOWS AND UNMARRIED WOMEN HAVE QUITE AMPLE WORK TO DO IN THE WORLD FOR THE GOOD OF OTHERS TO ABSORB ALL THEIR POWERS WIVES AND MOTHERS HAVE A VERY NOBLE WORK GIVEN THEM BY GOD AND WANT NO MORE
1757-128127-0064 THE WHOLE PASSAGE IS EXTREMELY INTERESTING AND THE PHRASE UNATTACHED LADIES IS QUITE DELIGHTFUL AND REMINDS ONE OF CHARLES LAMB ISMAY'S CHILDREN IS BY THE CLEVER AUTHORESS OF THAT WONDERFUL LITTLE STORY FLITTERS TATTERS AND THE COUNSELLOR
1757-128127-0065 A STORY WHICH DELIGHTED THE REALISTS BY ITS TRUTH FASCINATED MISTER RUSKIN BY ITS BEAUTY AND REMAINS TO THE PRESENT DAY THE MOST PERFECT PICTURE OF STREET ARAB LIFE IN ALL ENGLISH PROSE FICTION THE SCENE OF THE NOVEL IS LAID IN THE SOUTH OF IRELAND
1757-128127-0066 AND THE PLOT IS EXTREMELY DRAMATIC AND INGENIOUS GODFREY MAULEVERER A RECKLESS YOUNG IRISHMAN RUNS AWAY WITH ISMAY D'ARCY A PRETTY PENNILESS GOVERNESS AND IS PRIVATELY MARRIED TO HER IN SCOTLAND
1757-128127-0067 SOME TIME AFTER THE BIRTH OF HER THIRD CHILD ISMAY DIED AND HER HUSBAND WHO HAD NEVER MADE HIS MARRIAGE PUBLIC NOR TAKEN ANY PAINS TO ESTABLISH THE LEGITIMACY OF HIS CHILDREN IS DROWNED WHILE YACHTING OFF THE COAST OF FRANCE
1757-128127-0068 WHO BRINGS THEM BACK TO IRELAND TO CLAIM THEIR INHERITANCE FOR THEM BUT A SUDDEN STROKE OF PARALYSIS DEPRIVES HER OF HER MEMORY AND SHE FORGETS THE NAME OF THE LITTLE SCOTCH VILLAGE IN WHICH ISMAY'S INFORMAL MARRIAGE TOOK PLACE
1757-128127-0069 THE BOY WHO IS CALLED GODFREY AFTER HIS FATHER IS A FASCINATING STUDY WITH HIS SWARTHY FOREIGN BEAUTY HIS FIERCE MOODS OF LOVE AND HATE HIS PASSIONATE PRIDE AND HIS PASSIONATE TENDERNESS
1757-128127-0070 THE ACCOUNT OF HIS MIDNIGHT RIDE TO WARN HIS ENEMY OF AN IMPENDING ATTACK OF MOONLIGHTERS IS MOST POWERFUL AND SPIRITED AND IT IS PLEASANT TO MEET IN MODERN FICTION A CHARACTER THAT HAS ALL THE FINE INCONSISTENCIES OF LIFE AND IS NEITHER TOO FANTASTIC AN EXCEPTION TO BE TRUE
1757-128127-0071 NOR TOO ORDINARY A TYPE TO BE COMMON EXCELLENT ALSO IN ITS DIRECT SIMPLICITY OF RENDERING IS THE PICTURE OF MISS JULIET D'ARCY AND THE SCENE IN WHICH AT THE MOMENT OF HER DEATH THE OLD WOMAN'S MEMORY RETURNS TO HER IS QUITE ADMIRABLE
1757-128127-0072 BOTH IN CONCEPTION AND IN TREATMENT TO ME HOWEVER THE CHIEF INTEREST OF THE BOOK LIES IN THE LITTLE LIFELIKE SKETCHES OF IRISH CHARACTER WITH WHICH IT ABOUNDS MODERN REALISTIC ART HAS NOT YET PRODUCED A HAMLET
1757-128127-0073 BUT AT LEAST IT MAY CLAIM TO HAVE STUDIED GUILDENSTERN AND ROSENCRANTZ VERY CLOSELY AND FOR PURE FIDELITY AND TRUTH TO NATURE NOTHING COULD BE BETTER THAN THE MINOR CHARACTERS IN ISMAY'S CHILDREN HERE WE HAVE THE KINDLY OLD PRIEST WHO ARRANGES ALL THE MARRIAGES IN HIS PARISH
1757-128127-0074 AND HAS A STRONG OBJECTION TO PEOPLE WHO INSIST ON MAKING LONG CONFESSIONS THE IMPORTANT YOUNG CURATE FRESH FROM MAYNOOTH WHO GIVES HIMSELF MORE AIRS THAN A BISHOP AND HAS TO BE KEPT IN ORDER THE PROFESSIONAL BEGGARS WITH THEIR DEVOUT FAITH THEIR GROTESQUE HUMOUR
1757-128127-0075 AND THEIR INCORRIGIBLE LAZINESS THE SHREWD SHOPKEEPER WHO IMPORTS ARMS IN FLOUR BARRELS FOR THE USE OF THE MOONLIGHTERS AND AS SOON AS HE HAS GOT RID OF THEM GIVES INFORMATION OF THEIR WHEREABOUTS TO THE POLICE
1757-128127-0076 THE YOUNG MEN WHO GO OUT AT NIGHT TO BE DRILLED BY AN IRISH AMERICAN THE FARMERS WITH THEIR WILD LAND HUNGER BIDDING SECRETLY AGAINST EACH OTHER FOR EVERY VACANT FIELD THE DISPENSARY DOCTOR WHO IS ALWAYS REGRETTING THAT HE HAS NOT GOT A TRINITY COLLEGE DEGREE
1757-128127-0077 THE PLAIN GIRLS WHO WANT TO GO INTO CONVENTS THE PRETTY GIRLS WHO WANT TO GET MARRIED AND THE SHOPKEEPERS DAUGHTERS WHO WANT TO BE THOUGHT YOUNG LADIES THERE IS A WHOLE PELL MELL OF MEN AND WOMEN A COMPLETE PANORAMA OF PROVINCIAL LIFE
1757-128127-0078 THIS NOTE OF REALISM IN DEALING WITH NATIONAL TYPES OF CHARACTER HAS ALWAYS BEEN A DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC OF IRISH FICTION FROM THE DAYS OF MISS EDGEWORTH DOWN TO OUR OWN DAYS
1757-128127-0079 AND IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO SEE IN ISMAY'S CHILDREN SOME TRACES OF THE INFLUENCE OF CASTLE RACK RENT I FEAR HOWEVER THAT FEW PEOPLE READ MISS EDGEWORTH NOWADAYS THOUGH BOTH SCOTT AND TOURGENIEFF ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR INDEBTEDNESS TO HER NOVELS
1757-128127-0080 AND HER STYLE IS ALWAYS ADMIRABLE IN ITS CLEARNESS AND PRECISION MISS LEFFLER ARNIM'S STATEMENT IN A LECTURE DELIVERED RECENTLY AT SAINT SAVIOUR'S HOSPITAL THAT SHE HAD HEARD OF INSTANCES WHERE LADIES WERE SO DETERMINED NOT TO EXCEED THE FASHIONABLE MEASUREMENT
1757-128127-0081 THAT THEY HAD ACTUALLY HELD ON TO A CROSS BAR WHILE THEIR MAIDS FASTENED THE FIFTEEN INCH CORSET HAS EXCITED A GOOD DEAL OF INCREDULITY BUT THERE IS NOTHING REALLY IMPROBABLE IN IT FROM THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY TO OUR OWN DAY
1757-128127-0082 THERE IS HARDLY ANY FORM OF TORTURE THAT HAS NOT BEEN INFLICTED ON GIRLS AND ENDURED BY WOMEN IN OBEDIENCE TO THE DICTATES OF AN UNREASONABLE AND MONSTROUS FASHION IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A REAL SPANISH FIGURE SAYS MONTAIGNE
1757-128127-0083 NAY SOMETIMES THEY EVEN DIE THEREOF A FEW DAYS AFTER MY ARRIVAL AT SCHOOL MISSUS SOMERVILLE TELLS US IN HER MEMOIRS ALTHOUGH PERFECTLY STRAIGHT AND WELL MADE I WAS ENCLOSED IN STIFF STAYS WITH A STEEL BUSK IN FRONT
1757-128127-0084 WHILE ABOVE MY FROCK BANDS DREW MY SHOULDERS BACK TILL THE SHOULDER BLADES MET THEN A STEEL ROD WITH A SEMICIRCLE WHICH WENT UNDER MY CHIN WAS CLASPED TO THE STEEL BUSK IN MY STAYS
1757-128127-0085 IN THIS CONSTRAINED STATE I AND MOST OF THE YOUNGER GIRLS HAD TO PREPARE OUR LESSONS AND IN THE LIFE OF MISS EDGEWORTH
1757-128127-0086 SHE UNDERWENT ALL THE USUAL TORTURES OF BACK BOARDS IRON COLLARS AND DUMBS AND ALSO BECAUSE SHE WAS A VERY TINY PERSON THE UNUSUAL ONE OF BEING HUNG BY THE NECK TO DRAW OUT THE MUSCLES AND INCREASE THE GROWTH A SIGNAL FAILURE IN HER CASE
1757-128127-0087 INDEED INSTANCES OF ABSOLUTE MUTILATION AND MISERY ARE SO COMMON IN THE PAST THAT IT IS UNNECESSARY TO MULTIPLY THEM BUT IT IS REALLY SAD TO THINK THAT IN OUR OWN DAY A CIVILISED WOMAN CAN HANG ON TO A CROSS BAR
1757-128127-0088 WHILE HER MAID LACES HER WAIST INTO A FIFTEEN INCH CIRCLE TO BEGIN WITH THE WAIST IS NOT A CIRCLE AT ALL BUT AN OVAL NOR CAN THERE BE ANY GREATER ERROR THAN TO IMAGINE THAT AN UNNATURALLY SMALL WAIST GIVES AN AIR OF GRACE OR EVEN OF SLIGHTNESS TO THE WHOLE FIGURE
1757-128127-0089 ITS EFFECT AS A RULE IS SIMPLY TO EXAGGERATE THE WIDTH OF THE SHOULDERS AND THE HIPS AND THOSE WHOSE FIGURES POSSESS THAT STATELINESS WHICH IS CALLED STOUTNESS BY THE VULGAR CONVERT WHAT IS A QUALITY INTO A DEFECT BY YIELDING TO THE SILLY EDICTS OF FASHION
1757-128127-0090 ON THE SUBJECT OF TIGHT LACING THE FASHIONABLE ENGLISH WAIST ALSO IS NOT MERELY FAR TOO SMALL AND CONSEQUENTLY QUITE OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE REST OF THE FIGURE BUT IT IS WORN FAR TOO LOW DOWN I USE THE EXPRESSION WORN ADVISEDLY
1757-128127-0091 FOR A WAIST NOWADAYS SEEMS TO BE REGARDED AS AN ARTICLE OF APPAREL TO BE PUT ON WHEN AND WHERE ONE LIKES A LONG WAIST ALWAYS IMPLIES SHORTNESS OF THE LOWER LIMBS AND FROM THE ARTISTIC POINT OF VIEW HAS THE EFFECT OF DIMINISHING THE HEIGHT
1757-128127-0092 I FEEL QUITE SURE THAT ALL ENGLISH WOMEN OF CULTURE AND POSITION WILL SET THEIR FACES AGAINST SUCH STUPID AND DANGEROUS PRACTICES AS ARE RELATED BY MISS LEFFLER ARNIM FASHION'S MOTTO IS
1757-128127-0093 IT IS ONLY RIGHT THAT I SHOULD STATE MY EXACT POSITION IN THE MATTER FASHION IS SUCH AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE MUNDUS MULIEBRIS OF OUR DAY THAT IT SEEMS TO ME ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT ITS GROWTH DEVELOPMENT AND PHASES SHOULD BE DULY CHRONICLED
1757-128127-0094 AND THE HISTORICAL AND PRACTICAL VALUE OF SUCH A RECORD DEPENDS ENTIRELY UPON ITS PERFECT FIDELITY TO FACT BESIDES IT IS QUITE EASY FOR THE CHILDREN OF LIGHT TO ADAPT ALMOST ANY FASHIONABLE FORM OF DRESS TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF UTILITY AND THE DEMANDS OF GOOD TASTE
1757-128127-0095 THE SARAH BERNHARDT TEA GOWN FOR INSTANCE FIGURED IN THE PRESENT ISSUE HAS MANY GOOD POINTS ABOUT IT AND THE GIGANTIC DRESS IMPROVER DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME TO BE REALLY ESSENTIAL TO THE MODE AND THOUGH THE POSTILLION COSTUME OF THE FANCY DRESS BALL
1757-128127-0096 IS ABSOLUTELY DETESTABLE IN ITS SILLINESS AND VULGARITY THE SO CALLED LATE GEORGIAN COSTUME IN THE SAME PLATE IS RATHER PLEASING I MUST HOWEVER PROTEST AGAINST THE IDEA THAT TO CHRONICLE THE DEVELOPMENT OF FASHION
1757-128127-0097 IMPLIES ANY APPROVAL OF THE PARTICULAR FORMS THAT FASHION MAY ADOPT MISSUS CRAIK'S ARTICLE ON THE CONDITION OF THE ENGLISH STAGE WILL I FEEL SURE BE READ WITH GREAT INTEREST BY ALL WHO ARE WATCHING THE DEVELOPMENT OF DRAMATIC ART IN THIS COUNTRY
1757-128127-0098 IT WAS THE LAST THING WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR OF JOHN HALIFAX GENTLEMAN AND REACHED ME ONLY A FEW DAYS BEFORE HER LAMENTED DEATH THAT THE STATE OF THINGS IS SUCH AS MISSUS CRAIK DESCRIBES
1757-128127-0099 HE WAS CHARGED ALONG WITH BOILEAU WITH THE TASK OF REVISING THE TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTION AND RULES OF MADAME DE MAINTENON'S GREAT COLLEGE
1757-128127-0100 NOT MERELY IN FRANCE BUT ALSO IN ENGLAND AND AN UNCRITICAL LOVE OF SONNETS IS PREFERABLE ON THE WHOLE TO COARSENESS VULGARITY AND IGNORANCE
1757-128127-0101 I AM GLAD TO SEE THAT MISS RAMSAY'S BRILLIANT SUCCESS AT CAMBRIDGE IS NOT DESTINED TO REMAIN AN ISOLATED INSTANCE OF WHAT WOMEN CAN DO IN INTELLECTUAL COMPETITIONS WITH MEN AT THE ROYAL UNIVERSITY IN IRELAND
1757-128127-0102 HAS BEEN WON BY MISS STORY THE DAUGHTER OF A NORTH OF IRELAND CLERGYMAN IT IS PLEASANT TO BE ABLE TO CHRONICLE AN ITEM OF IRISH NEWS THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE VIOLENCE OF PARTY POLITICS OR PARTY FEELING AND THAT SHOWS HOW WORTHY WOMEN ARE OF THAT HIGHER CULTURE
1757-128127-0103 AND EDUCATION WHICH HAS BEEN SO TARDILY AND IN SOME INSTANCES SO GRUDGINGLY GRANTED TO THEM THE EMPRESS OF JAPAN HAS BEEN ORDERING A WHOLE WARDROBE OF FASHIONABLE DRESSES IN PARIS FOR HER OWN USE AND THE USE OF HER LADIES IN WAITING
1757-128127-0104 THE CHRYSANTHEMUM THE IMPERIAL FLOWER OF JAPAN HAS SUGGESTED THE TINTS OF MOST OF THE EMPRESS'S OWN GOWNS AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COLOUR SCHEMES OF OTHER FLOWERS THE REST OF THE COSTUMES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED
1757-128127-0105 ALSO BRINGS TO THE EMPRESS A LETTER OF FORMAL AND RESPECTFUL REMONSTRANCE FROM THE ENGLISH RATIONAL DRESS SOCIETY I TRUST THAT EVEN IF THE EMPRESS REJECTS THE SENSIBLE ARGUMENTS OF THIS IMPORTANT SOCIETY
1757-128127-0106 HER OWN ARTISTIC FEELING MAY INDUCE HER TO RECONSIDER HER RESOLUTION TO ABANDON EASTERN FOR WESTERN COSTUME I HOPE THAT SOME OF MY READERS WILL INTEREST THEMSELVES IN THE MINISTERING CHILDREN'S LEAGUE
1757-128127-0107 FOR WHICH MISTER WALTER CRANE HAS DONE THE BEAUTIFUL AND SUGGESTIVE DESIGN OF THE YOUNG KNIGHT THE BEST WAY TO MAKE CHILDREN GOOD IS TO MAKE THEM HAPPY AND HAPPINESS SEEMS TO ME AN ESSENTIAL PART OF LADY MEATH'S ADMIRABLE SCHEME
