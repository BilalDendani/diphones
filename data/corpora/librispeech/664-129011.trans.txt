664-129011-0000 SHE WAS ALL RESPECTFUL GRATITUDE TO MISSUS SEDLEY DELIGHTED BEYOND MEASURE AT THE BAZAARS AND IN A WHIRL OF WONDER AT THE THEATRE WHITHER THE GOOD NATURED LADY TOOK HER ONE DAY AMELIA HAD A HEADACHE AND COULD NOT GO UPON SOME PARTY OF PLEASURE TO WHICH THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE WERE INVITED
664-129011-0001 NOTHING COULD INDUCE HER FRIEND TO GO WITHOUT HER WHAT YOU WHO HAVE SHOWN THE POOR ORPHAN WHAT HAPPINESS AND LOVE ARE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE QUIT YOU NEVER AND THE GREEN EYES LOOKED UP TO HEAVEN AND FILLED WITH TEARS
664-129011-0002 AND MISSUS SEDLEY COULD NOT BUT OWN THAT HER DAUGHTER'S FRIEND HAD A CHARMING KIND HEART OF HER OWN AS FOR MISTER SEDLEY'S JOKES REBECCA LAUGHED AT THEM WITH A CORDIALITY AND PERSEVERANCE WHICH NOT A LITTLE PLEASED AND SOFTENED THAT GOOD NATURED GENTLEMAN
664-129011-0003 SIR AND MISTER SAMBO TO THE DELIGHT OF THAT ATTENDANT
664-129011-0004 ONCE IN LOOKING OVER SOME DRAWINGS WHICH AMELIA HAD SENT FROM SCHOOL REBECCA SUDDENLY CAME UPON ONE WHICH CAUSED HER TO BURST INTO TEARS AND LEAVE THE ROOM
664-129011-0005 AMELIA HASTENED AFTER HER FRIEND TO KNOW THE CAUSE OF THIS DISPLAY OF FEELING AND THE GOOD NATURED GIRL CAME BACK WITHOUT HER COMPANION RATHER AFFECTED TOO YOU KNOW HER FATHER WAS OUR DRAWING MASTER MAMMA AT CHISWICK AND USED TO DO ALL THE BEST PARTS OF OUR DRAWINGS
664-129011-0006 MY LOVE I'M SURE I ALWAYS HEARD MISS PINKERTON SAY THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH THEM HE ONLY MOUNTED THEM IT WAS CALLED MOUNTING MAMMA REBECCA REMEMBERS THE DRAWING AND HER FATHER WORKING AT IT AND THE THOUGHT OF IT CAME UPON HER RATHER SUDDENLY AND
664-129011-0007 SO YOU KNOW SHE THE POOR CHILD IS ALL HEART SAID MISSUS SEDLEY I WISH SHE COULD STAY WITH US ANOTHER WEEK SAID AMELIA SHE'S DEVILISH LIKE MISS CUTLER THAT I USED TO MEET AT DUMDUM ONLY FAIRER
664-129011-0008 O JOSEPH WE KNOW THAT STORY SAID AMELIA LAUGHING NEVER MIND ABOUT TELLING THAT BUT PERSUADE MAMMA TO WRITE TO SIR SOMETHING CRAWLEY FOR LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR POOR DEAR REBECCA HERE SHE COMES HER EYES RED WITH WEEPING I'M BETTER NOW SAID THE GIRL WITH
664-129011-0009 THE SWEETEST SMILE POSSIBLE TAKING GOOD NATURED MISSUS SEDLEY'S EXTENDED HAND AND KISSING IT RESPECTFULLY HOW KIND YOU ALL ARE TO ME ALL SHE ADDED WITH A LAUGH EXCEPT YOU MISTER JOSEPH ME SAID JOSEPH MEDITATING AN INSTANT DEPARTURE
664-129011-0010 YOU ARE NOT SO GOOD TO ME AS DEAR AMELIA HE DOESN'T KNOW YOU SO WELL CRIED AMELIA I DEFY ANYBODY NOT TO BE GOOD TO YOU MY DEAR SAID HER MOTHER THE CURRY WAS CAPITAL INDEED IT WAS SAID JOE QUITE GRAVELY
664-129011-0011 NO THERE WAS NOT AND THE CHILIS
664-129011-0012 I SHALL TAKE CARE HOW I LET YOU CHOOSE FOR ME ANOTHER TIME SAID REBECCA AS THEY WENT DOWN AGAIN TO DINNER
664-129011-0013 NO SAID SHE I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T AND THEN SHE GAVE HIM EVER SO GENTLE A PRESSURE WITH HER LITTLE HAND AND DREW IT BACK QUITE FRIGHTENED AND LOOKED FIRST FOR ONE INSTANT IN HIS FACE AND THEN DOWN AT THE CARPET RODS
664-129011-0014 IT WAS AN ADVANCE AND AS SUCH PERHAPS SOME LADIES OF INDISPUTABLE CORRECTNESS AND GENTILITY WILL CONDEMN THE ACTION AS IMMODEST BUT YOU SEE POOR DEAR REBECCA HAD ALL THIS WORK TO DO FOR HERSELF
664-129011-0015 IF A PERSON IS TOO POOR TO KEEP A SERVANT THOUGH EVER SO ELEGANT HE MUST SWEEP HIS OWN ROOMS IF A DEAR GIRL HAS NO DEAR MAMMA TO SETTLE MATTERS WITH THE YOUNG MAN SHE MUST DO IT FOR HERSELF AND OH WHAT A MERCY IT IS THAT THESE WOMEN DO NOT
664-129011-0016 EXERCISE THEIR POWERS OFTENER WE CAN'T RESIST THEM IF THEY DO LET THEM SHOW EVER SO LITTLE INCLINATION AND MEN GO DOWN ON THEIR KNEES AT ONCE OLD OR UGLY IT IS ALL THE SAME AND THIS I SET DOWN AS A POSITIVE TRUTH
664-129011-0017 A WOMAN WITH FAIR OPPORTUNITIES AND WITHOUT AN ABSOLUTE HUMP MAY MARRY WHOM SHE LIKES ONLY LET US BE THANKFUL THAT THE DARLINGS ARE LIKE THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD AND DON'T KNOW THEIR OWN POWER THEY WOULD OVERCOME US ENTIRELY IF THEY DID
664-129011-0018 I EXACTLY BEGIN TO FEEL AS I DID AT DUMDUM WITH MISS CUTLER MANY SWEET LITTLE APPEALS HALF TENDER HALF JOCULAR DID MISS SHARP MAKE TO HIM ABOUT THE DISHES AT DINNER FOR BY THIS TIME SHE WAS ON A FOOTING OF CONSIDERABLE FAMILIARITY WITH THE FAMILY
664-129011-0019 AND AS FOR THE GIRLS THEY LOVED EACH OTHER LIKE SISTERS YOUNG UNMARRIED GIRLS ALWAYS DO IF THEY ARE IN A HOUSE TOGETHER FOR TEN DAYS AS IF BENT UPON ADVANCING REBECCA'S PLANS IN EVERY WAY WHAT MUST AMELIA DO BUT REMIND HER BROTHER OF A PROMISE MADE LAST EASTER HOLIDAYS
664-129011-0020 A PROMISE THAT HE JOSEPH WOULD TAKE HER TO VAUXHALL NOW SHE SAID THAT REBECCA IS WITH US WILL BE THE VERY TIME O DELIGHTFUL SAID REBECCA GOING TO CLAP HER HANDS BUT SHE RECOLLECTED HERSELF AND PAUSED LIKE A MODEST CREATURE AS SHE WAS
664-129011-0021 AND THAT A WOMAN OF YOUR YEARS AND SIZE IS TO CATCH COLD IN SUCH AN ABOMINABLE DAMP PLACE THE CHILDREN MUST HAVE SOMEONE WITH THEM CRIED MISSUS SEDLEY LET JOE GO SAID HIS FATHER LAUGHING HE'S BIG ENOUGH
664-129011-0022 AT WHICH SPEECH EVEN MISTER SAMBO AT THE SIDEBOARD BURST OUT LAUGHING AND POOR FAT JOE FELT INCLINED TO BECOME A PARRICIDE ALMOST UNDO HIS STAYS CONTINUED THE PITILESS OLD GENTLEMAN
664-129011-0023 FLING SOME WATER IN HIS FACE MISS SHARP OR CARRY HIM UPSTAIRS THE DEAR CREATURE'S FAINTING POOR VICTIM CARRY HIM UP HE'S AS LIGHT AS A FEATHER
664-129011-0024 ORDER MISTER JOS'S ELEPHANT SAMBO CRIED THE FATHER SEND TO EXETER CHANGE SAMBO BUT SEEING JOS READY ALMOST TO CRY WITH VEXATION THE OLD JOKER STOPPED HIS LAUGHTER AND SAID HOLDING OUT HIS HAND TO HIS SON
664-129011-0025 BONEY HIMSELF HASN'T GOT SUCH IN HIS CELLAR MY BOY A GOBLET OF CHAMPAGNE RESTORED JOSEPH'S EQUANIMITY AND BEFORE THE BOTTLE WAS EMPTIED OF WHICH AS AN INVALID HE TOOK TWO THIRDS HE HAD AGREED TO TAKE THE YOUNG LADIES TO VAUXHALL
664-129011-0026 THE GIRLS MUST HAVE A GENTLEMAN APIECE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN JOS WILL BE SURE TO LEAVE EMMY IN THE CROWD
664-129011-0027 AT THIS I DON'T KNOW IN THE LEAST FOR WHAT REASON MISSUS SEDLEY LOOKED AT HER HUSBAND AND LAUGHED MISTER SEDLEY'S EYES TWINKLED IN A MANNER INDESCRIBABLY ROGUISH AND HE LOOKED AT AMELIA AND AMELIA HANGING DOWN HER HEAD
664-129011-0028 BLUSHED AS ONLY YOUNG LADIES OF SEVENTEEN KNOW HOW TO BLUSH
664-129011-0029 AMELIA HAD BETTER WRITE A NOTE SAID HER FATHER AND LET GEORGE OSBORNE SEE WHAT A BEAUTIFUL HANDWRITING WE HAVE BROUGHT BACK FROM MISS PINKERTON'S
664-129011-0030 DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU WROTE TO HIM TO COME ON TWELFTH NIGHT EMMY AND SPELT TWELFTH WITHOUT THE F THAT WAS YEARS AGO SAID AMELIA IT SEEMS LIKE YESTERDAY DON'T IT JOHN SAID MISSUS SEDLEY TO HER HUSBAND
664-129011-0031 AND THAT NIGHT IN A CONVERSATION WHICH TOOK PLACE IN A FRONT ROOM IN THE SECOND FLOOR IN A SORT OF TENT HUNG ROUND WITH CHINTZ OF A RICH AND FANTASTIC INDIA PATTERN AND DOUBLE WITH CALICO OF A TENDER ROSE COLOUR
664-129011-0032 IN THE INTERIOR OF WHICH SPECIES OF MARQUEE WAS A FEATHERBED ON WHICH WERE TWO PILLOWS ON WHICH WERE TWO ROUND RED FACES ONE IN A LACED NIGHTCAP AND ONE IN A SIMPLE COTTON ONE ENDING IN A TASSEL
664-129011-0033 MISSUS SEDLEY TOOK HER HUSBAND TO TASK FOR HIS CRUEL CONDUCT TO POOR JOE IT WAS QUITE WICKED OF YOU MISTER SEDLEY SAID SHE TO TORMENT THE POOR BOY SO MY DEAR SAID THE COTTON TASSEL IN DEFENCE OF HIS CONDUCT
664-129011-0034 JOS IS A GREAT DEAL VAINER THAN YOU EVER WERE IN YOUR LIFE AND THAT'S SAYING A GOOD DEAL THOUGH SOME THIRTY YEARS AGO IN THE YEAR SEVENTEEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY WHAT WAS IT PERHAPS YOU HAD A RIGHT TO BE VAIN I DON'T SAY NO
664-129011-0035 BUT I'VE NO PATIENCE WITH JOS AND HIS DANDIFIED MODESTY IT IS OUT JOSEPHING JOSEPH MY DEAR AND ALL THE WHILE THE BOY IS ONLY THINKING OF HIMSELF AND WHAT A FINE FELLOW HE IS I DOUBT MA'AM WE SHALL HAVE SOME TROUBLE WITH HIM YET
664-129011-0036 HERE IS EMMY'S LITTLE FRIEND MAKING LOVE TO HIM AS HARD AS SHE CAN THAT'S QUITE CLEAR AND IF SHE DOES NOT CATCH HIM SOME OTHER WILL THAT MAN IS DESTINED TO BE A PREY TO WOMAN AS I AM TO GO ON CHANGE EVERY DAY
664-129011-0037 IT'S A MERCY HE DID NOT BRING US OVER A BLACK DAUGHTER IN LAW MY DEAR BUT MARK MY WORDS THE FIRST WOMAN WHO FISHES FOR HIM HOOKS HIM SHE SHALL GO OFF TO MORROW THE LITTLE ARTFUL CREATURE SAID MISSUS SEDLEY WITH GREAT ENERGY
664-129011-0038 OR WERE REPLACED BY THE GENTLE BUT UNROMANTIC MUSIC OF THE NOSE AND SAVE WHEN THE CHURCH BELLS TOLLED THE HOUR AND THE WATCHMAN CALLED IT ALL WAS SILENT AT THE HOUSE OF JOHN SEDLEY ESQUIRE OF RUSSELL SQUARE AND THE STOCK EXCHANGE
664-129011-0039 WHEN MORNING CAME THE GOOD NATURED MISSUS SEDLEY NO LONGER THOUGHT OF EXECUTING HER THREATS WITH REGARD TO MISS SHARP FOR THOUGH NOTHING IS MORE KEEN NOR MORE COMMON NOR MORE JUSTIFIABLE THAN MATERNAL JEALOUSY
664-129011-0040 YET SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO SUPPOSE THAT THE LITTLE HUMBLE GRATEFUL GENTLE GOVERNESS WOULD DARE TO LOOK UP TO SUCH A MAGNIFICENT PERSONAGE AS THE COLLECTOR OF BOGGLEY WOLLAH
664-129011-0041 THE PETITION TOO FOR AN EXTENSION OF THE YOUNG LADY'S LEAVE OF ABSENCE HAD ALREADY BEEN DESPATCHED AND IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIND A PRETEXT FOR ABRUPTLY DISMISSING HER AND AS IF ALL THINGS CONSPIRED IN FAVOUR OF THE GENTLE REBECCA THE VERY ELEMENTS
664-129011-0042 FOR ON THE EVENING APPOINTED FOR THE VAUXHALL PARTY GEORGE OSBORNE HAVING COME TO DINNER AND THE ELDERS OF THE HOUSE HAVING DEPARTED ACCORDING TO INVITATION TO DINE WITH ALDERMAN BALLS AT HIGHBURY BARN THERE CAME ON SUCH A THUNDER STORM AS ONLY HAPPENS ON VAUXHALL NIGHTS
664-129011-0043 AND AS OBLIGED THE YOUNG PEOPLE PERFORCE TO REMAIN AT HOME MISTER OSBORNE DID NOT SEEM IN THE LEAST DISAPPOINTED AT THIS OCCURRENCE HE AND JOSEPH SEDLEY DRANK A FITTING QUANTITY OF PORT WINE TETE A TETE IN THE DINING ROOM
664-129011-0044 DURING THE DRINKING OF WHICH SEDLEY TOLD A NUMBER OF HIS BEST INDIAN STORIES FOR HE WAS EXTREMELY TALKATIVE IN MAN'S SOCIETY AND AFTERWARDS MISS AMELIA SEDLEY DID THE HONOURS OF THE DRAWING ROOM AND THESE FOUR YOUNG PERSONS PASSED SUCH A COMFORTABLE EVENING TOGETHER
664-129011-0045 THAT THEY DECLARED THEY WERE RATHER GLAD OF THE THUNDER STORM THAN OTHERWISE WHICH HAD CAUSED THEM TO PUT OFF THEIR VISIT TO VAUXHALL OSBORNE WAS SEDLEY'S GODSON AND HAD BEEN ONE OF THE FAMILY ANY TIME THESE THREE AND TWENTY YEARS
664-129011-0046 AT SIX WEEKS OLD HE HAD RECEIVED FROM JOHN SEDLEY A PRESENT OF A SILVER CUP AT SIX MONTHS OLD A CORAL WITH GOLD WHISTLE AND BELLS FROM HIS YOUTH UPWARDS HE WAS TIPPED REGULARLY BY THE OLD GENTLEMAN AT CHRISTMAS
664-129011-0047 IN A WORD GEORGE WAS AS FAMILIAR WITH THE FAMILY AS SUCH DAILY ACTS OF KINDNESS AND INTERCOURSE COULD MAKE HIM DO YOU REMEMBER SEDLEY WHAT A FURY YOU WERE IN WHEN I CUT OFF THE TASSELS OF YOUR HESSIAN BOOTS AND HOW MISS HEM
664-129011-0048 BUT VOWED THAT HE HAD TOTALLY FORGOTTEN IT WELL DO YOU REMEMBER COMING DOWN IN A GIG TO DOCTOR SWISHTAIL'S TO SEE ME BEFORE YOU WENT TO INDIA AND GIVING ME HALF A GUINEA AND A PAT ON THE HEAD I ALWAYS HAD AN IDEA THAT YOU WERE AT LEAST SEVEN FEET HIGH
664-129011-0049 YES AND AFTER I HAD CUT THE TASSELS OF HIS BOOTS TOO BOYS NEVER FORGET THOSE TIPS AT SCHOOL NOR THE GIVERS I DELIGHT IN HESSIAN BOOTS SAID REBECCA JOS SEDLEY WHO ADMIRED HIS OWN LEGS PRODIGIOUSLY
664-129011-0050 WAS EXTREMELY PLEASED AT THIS REMARK THOUGH HE DREW HIS LEGS UNDER HIS CHAIR AS IT WAS MADE MISS SHARP SAID GEORGE OSBORNE YOU WHO ARE SO CLEVER AN ARTIST YOU MUST MAKE A GRAND HISTORICAL PICTURE OF THE SCENE OF THE BOOTS
664-129011-0051 SEDLEY SHALL BE REPRESENTED IN BUCKSKINS AND HOLDING ONE OF THE INJURED BOOTS IN ONE HAND BY THE OTHER HE SHALL HAVE HOLD OF MY SHIRT FRILL AMELIA SHALL BE KNEELING NEAR HIM WITH HER LITTLE HANDS UP AND THE PICTURE SHALL HAVE A GRAND ALLEGORICAL TITLE
664-129011-0052 AS THE FRONTISPIECES HAVE IN THE MEDULLA AND THE SPELLING BOOK I SHAN'T HAVE TIME TO DO IT HERE SAID REBECCA I'LL DO IT WHEN WHEN I'M GONE AND SHE DROPPED HER VOICE AND LOOKED SO SAD AND PITEOUS
664-129011-0053 THAT EVERYBODY FELT HOW CRUEL HER LOT WAS AND HOW SORRY THEY WOULD BE TO PART WITH HER O THAT YOU COULD STAY LONGER DEAR REBECCA SAID AMELIA WHY ANSWERED THE OTHER STILL MORE SADLY
664-129011-0054 WAS ONE OF THE DEFECTS OF THIS SILLY LITTLE THING GEORGE OSBORNE LOOKED AT THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN WITH A TOUCHED CURIOSITY AND JOSEPH SEDLEY HEAVED SOMETHING VERY LIKE A SIGH OUT OF HIS BIG CHEST
664-129011-0055 AS HE CAST HIS EYES DOWN TOWARDS HIS FAVOURITE HESSIAN BOOTS LET US HAVE SOME MUSIC MISS SEDLEY AMELIA SAID GEORGE
664-129011-0056 WHO FELT AT THAT MOMENT AN EXTRAORDINARY ALMOST IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE TO SEIZE THE ABOVE MENTIONED YOUNG WOMAN IN HIS ARMS AND TO KISS HER IN THE FACE OF THE COMPANY AND SHE LOOKED AT HIM FOR A MOMENT
664-129011-0057 AND IF I SHOULD SAY THAT THEY FELL IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER AT THAT SINGLE INSTANT OF TIME I SHOULD PERHAPS BE TELLING AN UNTRUTH FOR THE FACT IS THAT THESE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE HAD BEEN BRED UP BY THEIR PARENTS FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE
664-129011-0058 AND THEIR BANNS HAD AS IT WERE BEEN READ IN THEIR RESPECTIVE FAMILIES ANY TIME THESE TEN YEARS THEY WENT OFF TO THE PIANO WHICH WAS SITUATED AS PIANOS USUALLY ARE
664-129011-0059 AND AS IT WAS RATHER DARK MISS AMELIA IN THE MOST UNAFFECTED WAY IN THE WORLD PUT HER HAND INTO MISTER OSBORNE'S WHO OF COURSE COULD SEE THE WAY AMONG THE CHAIRS AND OTTOMANS A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN SHE COULD
664-129011-0060 THOSE TWO HAVE TOLD THEIRS AS SOON AS HE GETS HIS COMPANY SAID JOSEPH I BELIEVE THE AFFAIR IS SETTLED GEORGE OSBORNE IS A CAPITAL FELLOW AND YOUR SISTER THE DEAREST CREATURE IN THE WORLD SAID REBECCA
664-129011-0061 A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE AND INTIMACY IS PRESENTLY ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THEM THERE IS NO NEED OF GIVING A SPECIAL REPORT OF THE CONVERSATION WHICH NOW TOOK PLACE BETWEEN MISTER SEDLEY AND THE YOUNG LADY FOR THE CONVERSATION AS MAY BE JUDGED FROM THE FOREGOING SPECIMEN
664-129011-0062 THOUGH FOR THE MATTER OF THAT THE COUPLE IN THE NEXT APARTMENT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DISTURBED HAD THE TALKING BEEN EVER SO LOUD SO OCCUPIED WERE THEY WITH THEIR OWN PURSUITS ALMOST FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE MISTER SEDLEY FOUND HIMSELF TALKING
664-129011-0063 WITHOUT THE LEAST TIMIDITY OR HESITATION TO A PERSON OF THE OTHER SEX MISS REBECCA ASKED HIM A GREAT NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT INDIA WHICH GAVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY OF NARRATING MANY INTERESTING ANECDOTES ABOUT THAT COUNTRY AND HIMSELF
664-129011-0064 HE DESCRIBED THE BALLS AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY KEPT THEMSELVES COOL IN THE HOT WEATHER WITH PUNKAHS TATTIES AND OTHER CONTRIVANCES
664-129011-0065 AND HE WAS VERY WITTY REGARDING THE NUMBER OF SCOTCHMEN WHOM LORD MINTO THE GOVERNOR GENERAL PATRONISED AND THEN HE DESCRIBED A TIGER HUNT AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THE MAHOUT OF HIS ELEPHANT HAD BEEN PULLED OFF HIS SEAT BY ONE OF THE INFURIATED ANIMALS
664-129011-0066 HOW DELIGHTED MISS REBECCA WAS AT THE GOVERNMENT BALLS AND HOW SHE LAUGHED AT THE STORIES OF THE SCOTCH AIDES DE CAMP AND CALLED MISTER SEDLEY A SAD WICKED SATIRICAL CREATURE AND HOW FRIGHTENED SHE WAS AT THE STORY OF THE ELEPHANT
664-129011-0067 FOR YOUR MOTHER'S SAKE DEAR MISTER SEDLEY SHE SAID
664-129011-0068 PROMISE NEVER TO GO ON ONE OF THOSE HORRID EXPEDITIONS POOH POOH MISS SHARP SAID HE PULLING UP HIS SHIRT COLLARS THE DANGER MAKES THE SPORT ONLY THE PLEASANTER
664-129011-0069 HE HAD NEVER BEEN BUT ONCE AT A TIGER HUNT WHEN THE ACCIDENT IN QUESTION OCCURRED AND WHEN HE WAS HALF KILLED NOT BY THE TIGER BUT BY THE FRIGHT AND AS HE TALKED ON HE GREW QUITE BOLD
664-129011-0070 AND ACTUALLY HAD THE AUDACITY TO ASK MISS REBECCA FOR WHOM SHE WAS KNITTING THE GREEN SILK PURSE HE WAS QUITE SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED AT HIS OWN GRACEFUL FAMILIAR MANNER
664-129011-0071 FOR ANY ONE WHO WANTS A PURSE REPLIED MISS REBECCA LOOKING AT HIM IN THE MOST GENTLE WINNING WAY SEDLEY WAS GOING TO MAKE ONE OF THE MOST ELOQUENT SPEECHES POSSIBLE AND HAD BEGUN
664-129011-0072 DID YOU EVER HEAR ANYTHING LIKE YOUR BROTHER'S ELOQUENCE WHISPERED MISTER OSBORNE TO AMELIA WHY YOUR FRIEND HAS WORKED MIRACLES THE MORE THE BETTER SAID MISS AMELIA WHO LIKE ALMOST ALL WOMEN WHO ARE WORTH A PIN
664-129011-0073 WAS A MATCH MAKER IN HER HEART AND WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED THAT JOSEPH SHOULD CARRY BACK A WIFE TO INDIA SHE HAD TOO IN THE COURSE OF THIS FEW DAYS CONSTANT INTERCOURSE WARMED INTO A MOST TENDER FRIENDSHIP FOR REBECCA
664-129011-0074 AND DISCOVERED A MILLION OF VIRTUES AND AMIABLE QUALITIES IN HER WHICH SHE HAD NOT PERCEIVED WHEN THEY WERE AT CHISWICK TOGETHER FOR THE AFFECTION OF YOUNG LADIES IS OF AS RAPID GROWTH AS JACK'S BEAN STALK AND REACHES UP TO THE SKY IN A NIGHT
664-129011-0075 IT IS WHAT SENTIMENTALISTS WHO DEAL IN VERY BIG WORDS CALL A YEARNING AFTER THE IDEAL AND SIMPLY MEANS THAT WOMEN ARE COMMONLY NOT SATISFIED UNTIL THEY HAVE HUSBANDS AND CHILDREN ON WHOM THEY MAY CENTRE AFFECTIONS WHICH ARE SPENT ELSEWHERE AS IT WERE
664-129011-0076 IN SMALL CHANGE HAVING EXPENDED HER LITTLE STORE OF SONGS OR HAVING STAYED LONG ENOUGH IN THE BACK DRAWING ROOM IT NOW APPEARED PROPER TO MISS AMELIA TO ASK HER FRIEND TO SING YOU WOULD NOT HAVE LISTENED TO ME SHE SAID TO MISTER OSBORNE
664-129011-0077 THOUGH SHE KNEW SHE WAS TELLING A FIB HAD YOU HEARD REBECCA FIRST I GIVE MISS SHARP WARNING THOUGH SAID OSBORNE THAT RIGHT OR WRONG I CONSIDER MISS AMELIA SEDLEY THE FIRST SINGER IN THE WORLD YOU SHALL HEAR SAID AMELIA
664-129011-0078 AND JOSEPH SEDLEY WAS ACTUALLY POLITE ENOUGH TO CARRY THE CANDLES TO THE PIANO OSBORNE HINTED THAT HE SHOULD LIKE QUITE AS WELL TO SIT IN THE DARK BUT MISS SEDLEY LAUGHING DECLINED TO BEAR HIM COMPANY ANY FARTHER
664-129011-0079 AND THE TWO ACCORDINGLY FOLLOWED MISTER JOSEPH REBECCA SANG FAR BETTER THAN HER FRIEND THOUGH OF COURSE OSBORNE WAS FREE TO KEEP HIS OPINION AND EXERTED HERSELF TO THE UTMOST AND INDEED TO THE WONDER OF AMELIA
664-129011-0080 WHO HAD NEVER KNOWN HER PERFORM SO WELL SHE SANG A FRENCH SONG WHICH JOSEPH DID NOT UNDERSTAND IN THE LEAST AND WHICH GEORGE CONFESSED HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND AND THEN A NUMBER OF THOSE SIMPLE BALLADS WHICH WERE THE FASHION FORTY YEARS AGO
664-129011-0081 AND IN WHICH BRITISH TARS OUR KING POOR SUSAN BLUE EYED MARY AND THE LIKE WERE THE PRINCIPAL THEMES THEY ARE NOT IT IS SAID VERY BRILLIANT IN A MUSICAL POINT OF VIEW BUT CONTAIN NUMBERLESS GOOD NATURED SIMPLE APPEALS TO THE AFFECTIONS
664-129011-0082 SOSPIRI AND FELICITA OF THE ETERNAL DONIZETTIAN MUSIC WITH WHICH WE ARE FAVOURED NOW A DAYS CONVERSATION OF A SENTIMENTAL SORT BEFITTING THE SUBJECT WAS CARRIED ON BETWEEN THE SONGS TO WHICH SAMBO AFTER HE HAD BROUGHT THE TEA
664-129011-0083 THE DELIGHTED COOK AND EVEN MISSUS BLENKINSOP THE HOUSEKEEPER CONDESCENDED TO LISTEN ON THE LANDING PLACE AMONG THESE DITTIES WAS ONE THE LAST OF THE CONCERT AND TO THE FOLLOWING EFFECT AH
664-129011-0084 AH LOUD AND PIERCING WAS THE STORM THE COTTAGE ROOF WAS SHELTER'D SURE
664-129011-0085 THE DAWN IS UP THE GUEST IS GONE THE COTTAGE HEARTH IS BLAZING STILL HEAVEN PITY ALL POOR WANDERERS LONE HARK TO THE WIND UPON THE HILL IT WAS THE SENTIMENT OF THE BEFORE MENTIONED WORDS WHEN I'M GONE
664-129011-0086 OVER AGAIN AS SHE CAME TO THE LAST WORDS MISS SHARP'S DEEP TONED VOICE FALTERED EVERYBODY FELT THE ALLUSION TO HER DEPARTURE AND TO HER HAPLESS ORPHAN STATE JOSEPH SEDLEY WHO WAS FOND OF MUSIC AND SOFT HEARTED
664-129011-0087 JOSEPH SEDLEY'S BACHELORHOOD WOULD HAVE BEEN AT AN END AND THIS WORK WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BUT AT THE CLOSE OF THE DITTY REBECCA QUITTED THE PIANO AND GIVING HER HAND TO AMELIA WALKED AWAY INTO THE FRONT DRAWING ROOM TWILIGHT
664-129011-0088 AND AT THIS MOMENT MISTER SAMBO MADE HIS APPEARANCE WITH A TRAY CONTAINING SANDWICHES JELLIES AND SOME GLITTERING GLASSES AND DECANTERS ON WHICH JOSEPH SEDLEY'S ATTENTION WAS IMMEDIATELY FIXED
664-129011-0089 WHEN THE PARENTS OF THE HOUSE OF SEDLEY RETURNED FROM THEIR DINNER PARTY THEY FOUND THE YOUNG PEOPLE SO BUSY IN TALKING THAT THEY HAD NOT HEARD THE ARRIVAL OF THE CARRIAGE AND MISTER JOSEPH WAS IN THE ACT OF SAYING
664-129011-0090 JOS INSTANTLY RELAPSED INTO AN ALARMED SILENCE AND QUICKLY TOOK HIS DEPARTURE HE DID NOT LIE AWAKE ALL NIGHT THINKING WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS IN LOVE WITH MISS SHARP THE PASSION OF LOVE NEVER INTERFERED WITH THE APPETITE OR THE SLUMBER OF MISTER JOSEPH SEDLEY
664-129011-0091 BUT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF HOW DELIGHTFUL IT WOULD BE TO HEAR SUCH SONGS AS THOSE AFTER CUTCHERRY WHAT A DISTINGUEE GIRL SHE WAS HOW SHE COULD SPEAK FRENCH BETTER THAN THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S LADY HERSELF
664-129011-0092 AND WHAT A SENSATION SHE WOULD MAKE AT THE CALCUTTA BALLS IT'S EVIDENT THE POOR DEVIL'S IN LOVE WITH ME THOUGHT HE SHE IS JUST AS RICH AS MOST OF THE GIRLS WHO COME OUT TO INDIA
664-129011-0093 AND IN THESE MEDITATIONS HE FELL ASLEEP HOW MISS SHARP LAY AWAKE THINKING WILL HE COME OR NOT TO MORROW NEED NOT BE TOLD HERE
664-129011-0094 SADLY PUTTING OUT AMELIA WHO WAS WRITING TO HER TWELVE DEAREST FRIENDS AT CHISWICK MALL AND REBECCA WAS EMPLOYED UPON HER YESTERDAY'S WORK AS JOE'S BUGGY DROVE UP AND WHILE AFTER HIS USUAL THUNDERING KNOCK AND POMPOUS BUSTLE AT THE DOOR
664-129011-0095 KNOWING GLANCES WERE TELEGRAPHED BETWEEN OSBORNE AND MISS SEDLEY AND THE PAIR SMILING ARCHLY LOOKED AT REBECCA WHO ACTUALLY BLUSHED AS SHE BENT HER FAIR RINGLETS OVER HER KNITTING HOW HER HEART BEAT AS JOSEPH APPEARED
664-129011-0096 JOSEPH PUFFING FROM THE STAIRCASE IN SHINING CREAKING BOOTS JOSEPH IN A NEW WAISTCOAT RED WITH HEAT AND NERVOUSNESS AND BLUSHING BEHIND HIS WADDED NECKCLOTH IT WAS A NERVOUS MOMENT FOR ALL
664-129011-0097 AND AS FOR AMELIA I THINK SHE WAS MORE FRIGHTENED THAN EVEN THE PEOPLE MOST CONCERNED SAMBO WHO FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR AND ANNOUNCED MISTER JOSEPH FOLLOWED GRINNING IN THE COLLECTOR'S REAR
664-129011-0098 AND BEARING TWO HANDSOME NOSEGAYS OF FLOWERS WHICH THE MONSTER HAD ACTUALLY HAD THE GALLANTRY TO PURCHASE IN COVENT GARDEN MARKET THAT MORNING THEY WERE NOT AS BIG AS THE HAYSTACKS WHICH LADIES CARRY ABOUT WITH THEM NOW A DAYS IN CONES OF FILIGREE PAPER
664-129011-0099 BUT THE YOUNG WOMEN WERE DELIGHTED WITH THE GIFT AS JOSEPH PRESENTED ONE TO EACH WITH AN EXCEEDINGLY SOLEMN BOW BRAVO JOS CRIED OSBORNE THANK YOU DEAR JOSEPH SAID AMELIA
664-129011-0100 QUITE READY TO KISS HER BROTHER IF HE WERE SO MINDED AND I THINK FOR A KISS FROM SUCH A DEAR CREATURE AS AMELIA I WOULD PURCHASE ALL MISTER LEE'S CONSERVATORIES OUT OF HAND O HEAVENLY HEAVENLY FLOWERS EXCLAIMED MISS SHARP
664-129011-0101 AND SMELT THEM DELICATELY AND HELD THEM TO HER BOSOM AND CAST UP HER EYES TO THE CEILING IN AN ECSTASY OF ADMIRATION PERHAPS SHE JUST LOOKED FIRST INTO THE BOUQUET TO SEE WHETHER THERE WAS A BILLET DOUX HIDDEN AMONG THE FLOWERS
664-129011-0102 BUT THERE WAS NO LETTER DO THEY TALK THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS AT BOGGLEY WOLLAH SEDLEY ASKED OSBORNE LAUGHING POOH NONSENSE REPLIED THE SENTIMENTAL YOUTH BOUGHT EM AT NATHAN'S VERY GLAD YOU LIKE EM
664-129011-0103 AND EH AMELIA MY DEAR I BOUGHT A PINE APPLE AT THE SAME TIME WHICH I GAVE TO SAMBO LET'S HAVE IT FOR TIFFIN VERY COOL AND NICE THIS HOT WEATHER REBECCA SAID SHE HAD NEVER TASTED A PINE AND LONGED BEYOND EVERYTHING TO TASTE ONE
664-129011-0104 SO THE CONVERSATION WENT ON I DON'T KNOW ON WHAT PRETEXT OSBORNE LEFT THE ROOM OR WHY PRESENTLY AMELIA WENT AWAY PERHAPS TO SUPERINTEND THE SLICING OF THE PINE APPLE
664-129011-0105 BUT JOS WAS LEFT ALONE WITH REBECCA WHO HAD RESUMED HER WORK AND THE GREEN SILK AND THE SHINING NEEDLES WERE QUIVERING RAPIDLY UNDER HER WHITE SLENDER FINGERS WHAT A BEAUTIFUL
664-129011-0106 SAID THE COLLECTOR IT MADE ME CRY ALMOST PON MY HONOUR IT DID BECAUSE YOU HAVE A KIND HEART MISTER JOSEPH ALL THE SEDLEYS HAVE I THINK IT KEPT ME AWAKE LAST NIGHT AND I WAS TRYING TO HUM IT THIS MORNING IN BED

664-129011-0109 AND BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO ASK HOW MISTER JOSEPH SEDLEY OF THE EAST INDIA COMPANY'S SERVICE WAS ACTUALLY SEATED TETE A TETE WITH A YOUNG LADY LOOKING AT HER WITH A MOST KILLING EXPRESSION
664-129011-0110 HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT BEFORE HER IN AN IMPLORING ATTITUDE AND HIS HANDS BOUND IN A WEB OF GREEN SILK WHICH SHE WAS UNWINDING IN THIS ROMANTIC POSITION OSBORNE AND AMELIA FOUND THE INTERESTING PAIR
664-129011-0111 WHEN THEY ENTERED TO ANNOUNCE THAT TIFFIN WAS READY THE SKEIN OF SILK WAS JUST WOUND ROUND THE CARD BUT MISTER JOS HAD NEVER SPOKEN I AM SURE HE WILL TO NIGHT DEAR AMELIA SAID AS SHE PRESSED REBECCA'S HAND
