5333-5083-0000 THERE WAS IN THE DAYS OF WHICH I WRITE AN OLD FASHIONED CUSTOM ON THE ENGLISH ROAD WHICH I SUSPECT IS NOW OBSOLETE OR PRACTISED ONLY BY THE VULGAR JOURNEYS OF LENGTH BEING MADE ON HORSEBACK AND OF COURSE BY BRIEF STAGES
5333-5083-0001 A COUNTERPART TO THIS DECENT PRACTICE AND A REMNANT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY WAS THAT THE LANDLORD OF A PRINCIPAL INN LAID ASIDE HIS CHARACTER OF A PUBLICAN ON THE SEVENTH DAY AND INVITED THE GUESTS WHO CHANCED TO BE WITHIN HIS WALLS
5333-5083-0002 TO TAKE A PART OF HIS FAMILY BEEF AND PUDDING THIS INVITATION
5333-5083-0003 THAT THERE WAS A SCOTCH GENTLEMAN TO DINE WITH US A GENTLEMAN WHAT SORT OF A GENTLEMAN SAID MY COMPANION SOMEWHAT HASTILY HIS MIND I SUPPOSE RUNNING ON GENTLEMEN OF THE PAD AS THEY WERE THEN TERMED
5333-5083-0004 WHY A SCOTCH SORT OF A GENTLEMAN AS I SAID BEFORE RETURNED MINE HOST THEY ARE ALL GENTLE YE MUN KNOW
5333-5083-0005 ANSWERED MY COMPANION AND THEN TURNING TO ME HE GAVE VENT TO THE TENOR OF HIS OWN REFLECTIONS I RESPECT THE SCOTCH SIR I LOVE AND HONOUR THE NATION FOR THEIR SENSE OF MORALITY MEN TALK OF THEIR FILTH AND THEIR POVERTY
5333-5083-0006 BUT COMMEND ME TO STERLING HONESTY THOUGH CLAD IN RAGS AS THE POET SAITH I HAVE BEEN CREDIBLY ASSURED SIR BY MEN ON WHOM I CAN DEPEND THAT THERE WAS NEVER KNOWN SUCH A THING IN SCOTLAND AS A HIGHWAY ROBBERY
5333-5083-0007 THAT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE
5333-5083-0008 AND HOW GO MARKETS IN THE SOUTH EVEN IN THE ORDINAR REPLIED MISTER CAMPBELL WISE FOLKS BUY AND SELL AND FOOLS ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD BUT WISE MEN AND FOOLS BOTH EAT THEIR DINNER ANSWERED OUR JOLLY ENTERTAINER
5333-5083-0009 AND HERE A COMES AS PRIME A BUTTOCK OF BEEF AS E'ER HUNGRY MEN STUCK FORK IN SO SAYING HE EAGERLY WHETTED HIS KNIFE ASSUMED HIS SEAT OF EMPIRE AT THE HEAD OF THE BOARD AND LOADED THE PLATES OF HIS SUNDRY GUESTS WITH HIS GOOD CHEER
5333-5083-0010 THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD HEARD THE SCOTTISH ACCENT OR INDEED THAT I HAD FAMILIARLY MET WITH AN INDIVIDUAL OF THE ANCIENT NATION BY WHOM IT WAS SPOKEN YET FROM AN EARLY PERIOD THEY HAD OCCUPIED AND INTERESTED MY IMAGINATION
5333-5083-0011 MY FATHER AS IS WELL KNOWN TO YOU WAS OF AN ANCIENT FAMILY IN NORTHUMBERLAND FROM WHOSE SEAT I WAS WHILE EATING THE AFORESAID DINNER NOT VERY MANY MILES DISTANT THE QUARREL BETWIXT HIM AND HIS RELATIVES WAS SUCH
5333-5083-0012 THAT HE SCARCELY EVER MENTIONED THE RACE FROM WHICH HE SPRUNG AND HELD AS THE MOST CONTEMPTIBLE SPECIES OF VANITY THE WEAKNESS WHICH IS COMMONLY TERMED FAMILY PRIDE HIS AMBITION WAS ONLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED AS WILLIAM OSBALDISTONE THE FIRST
5333-5083-0013 AT LEAST ONE OF THE FIRST MERCHANTS ON CHANGE AND TO HAVE PROVED HIM THE LINEAL REPRESENTATIVE OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR WOULD HAVE FAR LESS FLATTERED HIS VANITY THAN THE HUM AND BUSTLE
5333-5083-0014 HE WISHED NO DOUBT THAT I SHOULD REMAIN IN SUCH IGNORANCE OF MY RELATIVES AND DESCENT AS MIGHT INSURE A CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN MY FEELINGS AND HIS OWN ON THIS SUBJECT BUT HIS DESIGNS AS WILL HAPPEN OCCASIONALLY TO THE WISEST
5333-5083-0015 WERE IN SOME DEGREE AT LEAST COUNTERACTED BY A BEING WHOM HIS PRIDE WOULD NEVER HAVE SUPPOSED OF IMPORTANCE ADEQUATE TO INFLUENCE THEM IN ANY WAY HIS NURSE AN OLD NORTHUMBRIAN WOMAN ATTACHED TO HIM FROM HIS INFANCY
5333-5083-0016 THE CARE OF NURSING ME DURING MY CHILDISH ILLNESSES
5333-5083-0017 SHE POURED HERSELF FORTH TO MY INFANT EAR IN DESCRIPTIONS OF THE SCENES OF HER YOUTH
5333-5083-0018 WHICH I STILL PREFER TO ALL THE OPERA AIRS EVER MINTED BY THE CAPRICIOUS BRAIN OF AN ITALIAN MUS D OH THE OAK THE ASH AND THE BONNY IVY TREE THEY FLOURISH BEST AT HOME IN THE NORTH COUNTRIE NOW
5333-5083-0019 IN THE LEGENDS OF MABEL THE SCOTTISH NATION WAS EVER FRESHLY REMEMBERED WITH ALL THE EMBITTERED DECLAMATION OF WHICH THE NARRATOR WAS CAPABLE THE INHABITANTS OF THE OPPOSITE FRONTIER SERVED IN HER NARRATIVES TO FILL UP THE PARTS WHICH OGRES AND GIANTS
5333-5083-0020 WITH SEVEN LEAGUED BOOTS OCCUPY IN THE ORDINARY NURSERY TALES AND HOW COULD IT BE OTHERWISE WAS IT NOT THE BLACK DOUGLAS WHO SLEW WITH HIS OWN HAND THE HEIR OF THE OSBALDISTONE FAMILY THE DAY AFTER HE TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS ESTATE SURPRISING HIM
5333-5083-0021 AND HIS VASSALS WHILE SOLEMNIZING A FEAST
5333-5083-0022 WAS IT NOT WAT THE DEVIL WHO DROVE ALL THE YEAR OLD HOGS OFF THE BRAES OF LANTHORN SIDE IN THE VERY RECENT DAYS OF MY GRANDFATHER'S FATHER AND HAD WE NOT MANY A TROPHY BUT ACCORDING TO OLD MABEL'S VERSION OF HISTORY FAR MORE HONOURABLY GAINED
5333-5083-0023 ALL OUR FAMILY RENOWN WAS ACQUIRED ALL OUR FAMILY MISFORTUNES WERE OCCASIONED BY THE NORTHERN WARS WARMED BY SUCH TALES I LOOKED UPON THE SCOTTISH PEOPLE DURING MY CHILDHOOD
5333-5083-0024 AS A RACE HOSTILE BY NATURE TO THE MORE SOUTHERN INHABITANTS OF THIS REALM AND THIS VIEW OF THE MATTER WAS NOT MUCH CORRECTED BY THE LANGUAGE WHICH MY FATHER SOMETIMES HELD WITH RESPECT TO THEM HE HAD ENGAGED IN SOME LARGE SPECULATIONS CONCERNING OAK WOODS
5333-5083-0025 THE PROPERTY OF HIGHLAND PROPRIETORS AND ALLEGED THAT HE FOUND THEM MUCH MORE READY TO MAKE BARGAINS AND EXTORT EARNEST OF THE PURCHASE MONEY THAN PUNCTUAL IN COMPLYING ON THEIR SIDE WITH THE TERMS OF THE ENGAGEMENTS THE SCOTTISH MERCANTILE MEN
5333-5083-0026 THOUGH WITHOUT ANY FIXED PURPOSE OF DOING SO THEY IMPRESSED MY YOUTHFUL MIND WITH A SINCERE AVERSION TO THE NORTHERN INHABITANTS OF BRITAIN AS A PEOPLE BLOODTHIRSTY IN TIME OF WAR TREACHEROUS DURING TRUCE INTERESTED SELFISH AVARICIOUS
5333-5083-0027 AND TRICKY IN THE BUSINESS OF PEACEFUL LIFE AND HAVING FEW GOOD QUALITIES UNLESS THERE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED SUCH A FEROCITY WHICH RESEMBLED COURAGE IN MARTIAL AFFAIRS AND A SORT OF WILY CRAFT WHICH SUPPLIED THE PLACE OF WISDOM IN THE ORDINARY COMMERCE OF MANKIND
5333-5083-0028 IN JUSTIFICATION OR APOLOGY FOR THOSE WHO ENTERTAINED SUCH PREJUDICES I MUST REMARK THAT THE SCOTCH OF THAT PERIOD WERE GUILTY OF SIMILAR INJUSTICE TO THE ENGLISH
5333-5083-0029 HE HAD THE HARD FEATURES AND ATHLETIC FORM SAID TO BE PECULIAR TO HIS COUNTRY TOGETHER WITH THE NATIONAL INTONATION AND SLOW PEDANTIC MODE OF EXPRESSION ARISING FROM A DESIRE TO AVOID PECULIARITIES OF IDIOM OR DIALECT
5333-5083-0030 I COULD ALSO OBSERVE THE CAUTION AND SHREWDNESS OF HIS COUNTRY IN MANY OF THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH HE MADE AND THE ANSWERS WHICH HE RETURNED BUT I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THE AIR OF EASY SELF POSSESSION AND SUPERIORITY WITH WHICH HE SEEMED TO PREDOMINATE OVER THE COMPANY INTO WHICH HE WAS THROWN
5333-5083-0031 AS IT WERE BY ACCIDENT HIS DRESS WAS AS COARSE AS IT COULD BE BEING STILL DECENT AND AT A TIME WHEN GREAT EXPENSE WAS LAVISHED UPON THE WARDROBE EVEN OF THE LOWEST WHO PRETENDED TO THE CHARACTER OF GENTLEMAN THIS INDICATED MEDIOCRITY OF CIRCUMSTANCES
5333-5083-0032 IF NOT POVERTY HIS CONVERSATION INTIMATED THAT HE WAS ENGAGED IN THE CATTLE TRADE NO VERY DIGNIFIED PROFESSIONAL PURSUIT AND YET
5333-5083-0033 UNDER THESE DISADVANTAGES HE SEEMED AS A MATTER OF COURSE TO TREAT THE REST OF THE COMPANY WITH THE COOL AND CONDESCENDING POLITENESS WHICH IMPLIES A REAL OR IMAGINED SUPERIORITY OVER THOSE TOWARDS WHOM IT IS USED WHEN HE GAVE HIS OPINION ON ANY POINT
5333-5083-0034 IT WAS WITH THAT EASY TONE OF CONFIDENCE USED BY THOSE SUPERIOR TO THEIR SOCIETY IN RANK OR INFORMATION AS IF WHAT HE SAID COULD NOT BE DOUBTED
5333-5083-0035 MINE HOST AND HIS SUNDAY GUESTS AFTER AN EFFORT OR TWO TO SUPPORT THEIR CONSEQUENCE BY NOISE AND BOLD AVERMENT SUNK GRADUALLY UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF MISTER CAMPBELL WHO THUS FAIRLY POSSESSED HIMSELF OF THE LEAD IN THE CONVERSATION
5333-5083-0036 I WAS TEMPTED FROM CURIOSITY TO DISPUTE THE GROUND WITH HIM MYSELF CONFIDING IN MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD
5333-5083-0037 AND IN THE STORES WITH WHICH A TOLERABLE EDUCATION HAD POSSESSED MY MIND IN THE LATTER RESPECT HE OFFERED NO COMPETITION AND IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT HIS NATURAL POWERS HAD NEVER BEEN CULTIVATED BY EDUCATION
5333-5083-0038 CAUSTIC AND SOMEWHAT SATIRICAL REMARKS WERE THOSE OF A MAN WHO HAD BEEN A CLOSE OBSERVER OF THE AFFAIRS OF THAT COUNTRY ON THE SUBJECT OF POLITICS
5333-5083-0039 CAMPBELL OBSERVED A SILENCE AND MODERATION WHICH MIGHT ARISE FROM CAUTION THE DIVISIONS OF WHIG AND TORY THEN SHOOK ENGLAND TO HER VERY CENTRE AND A POWERFUL PARTY ENGAGED IN THE JACOBITE INTEREST
5333-5083-0040 MENACED THE DYNASTY OF HANOVER WHICH HAD BEEN JUST ESTABLISHED ON THE THRONE EVERY ALEHOUSE RESOUNDED WITH THE BRAWLS OF CONTENDING POLITICIANS AND AS MINE HOST'S POLITICS WERE OF THAT LIBERAL DESCRIPTION WHICH QUARRELLED WITH NO GOOD CUSTOMER
5333-5083-0041 HIS HEBDOMADAL VISITANTS WERE OFTEN DIVIDED IN THEIR OPINION AS IRRECONCILABLY AS IF HE HAD FEASTED THE COMMON COUNCIL THE CURATE AND THE APOTHECARY WITH A LITTLE MAN WHO MADE NO BOAST OF HIS VOCATION BUT WHO
5333-5083-0042 STRONGLY ESPOUSED THE CAUSE OF HIGH CHURCH AND THE STUART LINE THE EXCISE MAN AS IN DUTY BOUND AND THE ATTORNEY WHO LOOKED TO SOME PETTY OFFICE UNDER THE CROWN TOGETHER WITH MY FELLOW TRAVELLER WHO SEEMED TO ENTER KEENLY INTO THE CONTEST
5333-5083-0043 STAUNCHLY SUPPORTED THE CAUSE OF KING GEORGE AND THE PROTESTANT SUCCESSION DIRE WAS THE SCREAMING DEEP THE OATHS EACH PARTY APPEALED TO MISTER CAMPBELL ANXIOUS IT SEEMED TO ELICIT HIS APPROBATION YOU ARE A SCOTCHMAN SIR
5333-5083-0044 AND CONFER ON OUR FRIEND MISTER QUITAM THE PREFERMENT OF SOLICITOR GENERAL AND HE MAY ALSO GRANT SOME GOOD DEED OR REWARD TO THIS HONEST GENTLEMAN WHO IS SITTING UPON HIS PORTMANTEAU WHICH HE PREFERS TO A CHAIR AND QUESTIONLESS
5333-5083-0045 AND WHEN HE GETS HIS HAND IN PLAY HE MAY IF HE BE SO MINDED MAKE THIS REVEREND GENTLEMAN ARCHPRELATE OF CANTERBURY AND DOCTOR MIXIT CHIEF PHYSICIAN TO HIS HOUSEHOLD AND COMMIT HIS ROYAL BEARD TO THE CARE OF MY FRIEND LATHERUM
5333-5083-0046 IF HE LACKED IT I GIVE MY VOTE AND INTEREST TO JONATHAN BROWN OUR LANDLORD TO BE THE KING AND PRINCE OF SKINKERS CONDITIONALLY THAT HE FETCHES US ANOTHER BOTTLE AS GOOD AS THE LAST THIS SALLY WAS RECEIVED WITH GENERAL APPLAUSE IN WHICH THE LANDLORD CORDIALLY JOINED
5333-5083-0047 THAT BESET HIM AS HE CAME FROM WHITSON TRYSTE THOU ART DECEIVED FRIEND JONATHAN SAID CAMPBELL INTERRUPTING HIM THEY WERE BUT BARELY TWO AND TWO COWARDLY LOONS AS MAN COULD WISH TO MEET WITHAL AND DID YOU SIR REALLY
5333-5083-0048 SAID MY FELLOW TRAVELLER EDGING HIS CHAIR I SHOULD HAVE SAID HIS PORTMANTEAU NEARER TO MISTER CAMPBELL REALLY AND ACTUALLY BEAT TWO HIGHWAYMEN YOURSELF ALONE IN TROTH DID I SIR REPLIED CAMPBELL
5333-5083-0049 THIS PIECE OF GRATUITOUS INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ROUTE HE PROPOSED TO HIMSELF THE FIRST I HAD HEARD MY COMPANION BESTOW UPON ANY ONE FAILED TO EXCITE THE CORRESPONDING CONFIDENCE OF THE SCOTCHMAN WE CAN SCARCE TRAVEL TOGETHER HE REPLIED DRILY
5333-5083-0050 YOU SIR DOUBTLESS ARE WELL MOUNTED AND I FOR THE PRESENT TRAVEL ON FOOT OR ON A HIGHLAND SHELTY THAT DOES NOT HELP ME MUCH FASTER FORWARD SO SAYING HE CALLED FOR A RECKONING FOR THE WINE
5333-5083-0051 AND THROWING DOWN THE PRICE OF THE ADDITIONAL BOTTLE WHICH HE HAD HIMSELF INTRODUCED ROSE AS IF TO TAKE LEAVE OF US
5333-5083-0052 SAID THE TRAVELLER IN A TONE AS IF HE THOUGHT THE ARGUMENT SHOULD BEAR DOWN ALL OPPOSITION IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE SAID CAMPBELL SOMEWHAT CONTEMPTUOUSLY I HAVE BUSINESS AT ROTHBURY BUT I AM IN NO GREAT HURRY
5333-5083-0053 I CAN RIDE OUT OF THE WAY AND NEVER MISS A DAY OR SO FOR GOOD COMPANY UPON MY FAITH SIR SAID CAMPBELL I CANNOT RENDER YOU THE SERVICE YOU SEEM TO DESIDERATE I AM HE ADDED DRAWING HIMSELF UP HAUGHTILY TRAVELLING ON MY OWN PRIVATE AFFAIRS
5333-5083-0054 AND COMING UP TO ME AS THE COMPANY WERE DISPERSING OBSERVED YOUR FRIEND SIR IS TOO COMMUNICATIVE CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF HIS TRUST THAT GENTLEMAN I REPLIED LOOKING TOWARDS THE TRAVELLER IS NO FRIEND OF MINE
5333-5083-0055 HE REPLIED HASTILY THAT HE SEEMS A THOUGHT RASH IN CONFERRING THE HONOUR OF HIS COMPANY ON THOSE WHO DESIRE IT NOT THE GENTLEMAN REPLIED I KNOWS HIS OWN AFFAIRS BEST AND I SHOULD BE SORRY TO CONSTITUTE MYSELF A JUDGE OF THEM IN ANY RESPECT
5333-5083-0056 MISTER CAMPBELL MADE NO FARTHER OBSERVATION BUT MERELY WISHED ME A GOOD JOURNEY AND THE PARTY DISPERSED FOR THE EVENING NEXT DAY I PARTED COMPANY WITH MY TIMID COMPANION
5333-5083-0057 HIS TREMORS CEASED TO AMUSE ME AND TO SAY THE TRUTH
