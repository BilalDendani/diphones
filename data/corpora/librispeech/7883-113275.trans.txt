7883-113275-0000 WHILE OLIVER WAS RESTING IN SUCH GOOD HANDS VERY STRANGE THINGS WERE OCCURRING IN THE HOUSE OF FAGIN WHEN THE ARTFUL DODGER TOLD HIM OF THE ARREST THE JEW WAS FULL OF ANGER HE HAD INTENDED TO MAKE A CLEVER THIEF OF OLIVER
7883-113275-0001 AND COMPEL HIM TO BRING HIM MANY STOLEN THINGS NOW HE HAD NOT ONLY FAILED IN THIS AND LOST THE BOY'S HELP BUT HE WAS ALSO AFRAID THAT OLIVER WOULD TELL ALL ABOUT THE WICKED PRACTICES HE HAD SEEN AND SHOW THE OFFICERS WHERE HE HAD LIVED
7883-113275-0002 THIS HE THOUGHT WAS LIKELY TO HAPPEN AT ANY TIME UNLESS HE COULD GET THE BOY INTO HIS POWER AGAIN SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED TOO MEANTIME THAT MADE FAGIN ALMOST CRAZY WITH RAGE AT LOSING HIM
7883-113275-0003 IT WAS THIS A WICKED MAN SO WICKED THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF THUNDER WHO WENT BY THE NAME OF MONKS HAD COME TO HIM AND TOLD HIM HE WOULD PAY A LARGE SUM OF MONEY
7883-113275-0004 IF HE COULD SUCCEED IN MAKING OLIVER A THIEF AND SO RUIN HIS REPUTATION AND HIS GOOD NAME IT WAS PLAIN ENOUGH THAT FOR SOME REASON THE MAN HATED OLIVER BUT CUNNING AS FAGIN WAS
7883-113275-0005 HE WOULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED WHY FOR MONKS WAS REALLY OLIVER'S OLDER HALF BROTHER A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE THIS STORY BEGAN OLIVER'S FATHER HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO GO ON A TRIP TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY
7883-113275-0006 THE WILL DECLARED OLIVER SHOULD HAVE THE MONEY ONLY ON CONDITION THAT HE NEVER STAIN HIS NAME WITH ANY ACT OF MEANNESS DISHONOR COWARDICE OR WRONG IF HE DID DO THIS
7883-113275-0007 THEN HALF THE MONEY WAS TO GO TO THE OLDER SON THE DYING MAN ALSO WROTE A LETTER TO OLIVER'S MOTHER TELLING HER THAT HE HAD MADE THE WILL AND THAT HE WAS DYING BUT THE OLDER SON WHO WAS WITH HIM WHEN HE DIED
7883-113275-0008 FOUND THE LETTER AND DESTROYED IT SO OLIVER'S POOR MOTHER KNOWING NOTHING OF ALL THIS WHEN HIS FATHER DID NOT COME BACK THOUGHT AT LAST THAT HE HAD DESERTED HER
7883-113275-0009 AND IN HER SHAME STOLE AWAY FROM HER HOME POOR AND ILL CLAD TO DIE FINALLY IN THE POORHOUSE THE OLDER BROTHER WHO HAD TAKEN THE NAME OF MONKS HUNTED AND HUNTED FOR THEM
7883-113275-0010 BECAUSE HE HATED OLIVER ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR FATHER'S WILL AND WANTED TO DO HIM ALL THE HARM HE COULD
7883-113275-0011 BUT THIS WAS AFTER OLIVER HAD RUN AWAY HE FOUND HOWEVER TO HIS SATISFACTION THAT THE BOY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HIS PARENTAGE OR HIS REAL NAME
7883-113275-0012 THERE WAS ONLY ONE PERSON WHO COULD HAVE TOLD OLIVER AND THAT ONE WAS MISSUS BUMBLE SHE KNEW THROUGH THE LOCKET SHE HAD KEPT WHICH HAD BELONGED TO OLIVER'S MOTHER
7883-113275-0013 AND WHICH CONTAINED THE DEAD WOMAN'S WEDDING RING WITH HER NAME ENGRAVED INSIDE IT
7883-113275-0014 SHE THOUGHT IT A CAPITAL CHANCE TO MAKE SOME MONEY SHE WENT THEREFORE TO MONKS'S HOUSE AND SOLD THE LOCKET AND RING TO HIM THESE MONKS THOUGHT
7883-113275-0015 WERE THE ONLY PROOFS IN THE WORLD THAT COULD EVER SHOW OLIVER WHO HE WAS AND TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM EVER TO SEE THEM HE DROPPED THEM THROUGH A TRAP DOOR IN HIS HOUSE DOWN INTO THE RIVER
7883-113275-0016 WHERE THEY COULD NEVER BE FOUND BUT MONKS DID NOT GIVE UP SEARCHING FOR OLIVER AND AT LAST ON THE VERY DAY THAT OLIVER WAS ARRESTED HE SAW HIM COMING FROM FAGIN'S HOUSE WITH THE ARTFUL DODGER
7883-113275-0017 FROM HIS WONDERFUL RESEMBLANCE TO THEIR DEAD FATHER HE GUESSED AT ONCE
7883-113275-0018 KNOWING THE OTHER NOW TO BE IN LONDON MONKS WAS AFRAID THAT BY SOME ACCIDENT HE MIGHT YET FIND OUT WHAT A FORTUNE HAD BEEN WILLED HIM IF HE COULD ONLY MAKE OLIVER DISHONEST MONKS REFLECTED
7883-113275-0019 AND HAD MADE HIM HIS OFFER OF MONEY TO MAKE THE BOY A THIEF FAGIN OF COURSE HAD AGREED AND NOW TO FIND HIS VICTIM WAS OUT OF HIS POWER MADE THE JEW GRIND HIS TEETH WITH RAGE
7883-113275-0020 ALL THESE THINGS MADE FAGIN DETERMINED TO GAIN POSSESSION OF OLIVER AGAIN AND TO DO THIS HE GOT THE HELP OF TWO OTHERS A YOUNG WOMAN NAMED NANCY AND HER LOVER A BRUTAL ROBBER NAMED BILL SIKES
7883-113275-0021 THESE TWO DISCOVERED THAT OLIVER WAS AT MISTER BROWNLOW'S HOUSE AND LAY IN WAIT TO KIDNAP HIM IF HE EVER CAME OUT THE CHANCE THEY WAITED FOR OCCURRED BEFORE MANY DAYS
7883-113275-0022 THE ARTFUL DODGER HAD STOLEN THE HANDKERCHIEF AND OLIVER WENT WITHOUT DREAMING OF ANY DANGER SUDDENLY A YOUNG WOMAN IN A CAP AND APRON SCREAMED OUT BEHIND HIM VERY LOUDLY OH MY DEAR LITTLE BROTHER
7883-113275-0023 AND THREW HER ARMS TIGHT AROUND HIM OH MY GRACIOUS I'VE FOUND HIM SHE CRIED COME HOME DIRECTLY YOU NAUGHTY BOY FOR SHAME TO TREAT YOUR POOR MOTHER SO
7883-113275-0024 OLIVER STRUGGLED BUT TO NO PURPOSE NANCY FOR IT WAS SHE TOLD THE PEOPLE THAT CROWDED ABOUT THEM THAT IT WAS HER LITTLE BROTHER WHO HAD RUN AWAY FROM HOME AND NEARLY BROKEN HIS MOTHER'S HEART
7883-113275-0025 AND THAT SHE WANTED TO TAKE HIM BACK OLIVER INSISTED THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW HER AT ALL AND HADN'T ANY SISTER BUT JUST THEN BILL SIKES APPEARED AS HE HAD PLANNED
7883-113275-0026 AND SAID THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS TELLING THE TRUTH AND THAT OLIVER WAS A LITTLE RASCAL AND A LIAR THE PEOPLE WERE ALL CONVINCED AT THIS AND WHEN SIKES STRUCK OLIVER AND SEIZED HIM BY THE COLLAR THEY SAID SERVES HIM RIGHT
7883-113275-0027 AND SO OLIVER FOUND HIMSELF DRAGGED AWAY FROM MISTER BROWNLOW TO THE FILTHY HOUSE WHERE LIVED FAGIN THE WILY OLD JEW WAS OVERJOYED TO SEE THEM
7883-113275-0028 BUT IN SPITE OF THIS THERE WAS A LITTLE GOOD IN HER SHE HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO REPENT HAVING HELPED STEAL THE BOY AND NOW HIS PLIGHT TOUCHED HER HEART SHE SEIZED THE CLUB AND THREW IT INTO THE FIRE
7883-113275-0029 AND SO SAVED HIM THE BEATING FOR THAT TIME FOR MANY DAYS OLIVER WAS KEPT A PRISONER HE WAS FREE TO WANDER ABOUT THE MILDEWED OLD HOUSE
7883-113275-0030 BUT EVERY OUTER DOOR WAS LOCKED AND EVERY WINDOW HAD CLOSED IRON SHUTTERS ALL THE LIGHT CAME IN THROUGH SMALL ROUND HOLES AT THE TOP WHICH MADE THE ROOMS GLOOMY AND FULL OF SHADOWS
7883-113275-0031 THERE WAS ONLY ONE WINDOW TO LOOK OUT OF AND THAT WAS IN A BACK GARRET BUT IT HAD IRON BARS AND LOOKED OUT ONLY ON TO THE HOUSETOPS HE FOUND ONLY ONE BOOK TO READ THIS WAS A HISTORY OF THE LIVES OF GREAT CRIMINALS
7883-113275-0032 AND WAS FULL OF STORIES OF SECRET THEFTS AND MURDERS FOR THE OLD JEW HAVING TORTURED HIS MIND BY LONELINESS AND GLOOM HAD LEFT THE VOLUME IN HIS WAY HOPING IT WOULD INSTIL INTO HIS SOUL THE POISON THAT WOULD BLACKEN IT FOR EVER
7883-113275-0033 BUT OLIVER'S BLOOD RAN COLD AS HE READ AND HE PUSHED THE BOOK AWAY IN HORROR AND FALLING ON HIS KNEES PRAYED THAT HE MIGHT BE SPARED FROM SUCH DEEDS AND RESCUED FROM THAT TERRIBLE PLACE
7883-113275-0034 TO GO ON A JOURNEY WITH BILL SIKES
7883-113275-0035 OLIVER SAW SHE WAS VERY SORRY FOR HIM AND INDEED SHE TOLD HIM SHE WOULD HELP HIM IF SHE COULD BUT THAT THERE WAS NO USE TRYING TO ESCAPE NOW BECAUSE THEY WERE WATCHED ALL THE TIME AND IF HE GOT AWAY SIKES WOULD CERTAINLY KILL HER
7883-113275-0036 NANCY TOOK HIM TO THE HOUSE WHERE SIKES LIVED AND THE NEXT MORNING THE LATTER STARTED OUT MAKING OLIVER GO WITH HIM
7883-113275-0037 SIKES HAD A LOADED PISTOL IN HIS OVERCOAT POCKET AND HE SHOWED THIS TO OLIVER AND TOLD HIM IF HE SPOKE TO ANYBODY ON THE ROAD OR TRIED TO GET AWAY HE WOULD SHOOT HIM WITH IT THEY WALKED A LONG WAY OUT OF LONDON
7883-113275-0038 ONCE OR TWICE RIDING IN CARTS WHICH WERE GOING IN THEIR DIRECTION WHENEVER THIS HAPPENED SIKES KEPT HIS HAND IN THE POCKET WHERE THE PISTOL WAS SO THAT OLIVER WAS AFRAID TO APPEAL FOR HELP
7883-113275-0039 LATE AT NIGHT THEY CAME TO AN OLD DESERTED MANSION IN THE COUNTRY AND IN THE BASEMENT OF THIS WHERE A FIRE HAD BEEN KINDLED THEY JOINED TWO OTHER MEN WHOM OLIVER HAD SEEN MORE THAN ONCE IN FAGIN'S HOUSE IN LONDON
7883-113275-0040 TILL TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN SIKES WOKE HIM ROUGHLY AND BADE HIM COME WITH THEM IT WAS FOGGY AND COLD AND DARK OUTSIDE SIKES AND ONE OF THE OTHERS EACH TOOK ONE OF OLIVER'S HANDS
7883-113275-0041 AND SO THEY WALKED A QUARTER OF A MILE TO WHERE WAS A FINE HOUSE WITH A HIGH WALL AROUND IT THEY MADE HIM CLIMB OVER THE WALL WITH THEM AND PULLING HIM ALONG CREPT TOWARD THE HOUSE
7883-113275-0042 SO THAT HE TOO WOULD BE A BURGLAR HIS LIMBS BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND HE SANK TO HIS KNEES BEGGING THEM TO HAVE MERCY AND TO LET HIM RUN AWAY AND DIE IN THE FIELDS RATHER THAN TO MAKE HIM STEAL
7883-113275-0043 BUT SIKES DREW HIS PISTOL WITH A FRIGHTFUL OATH AND DRAGGED HIM ON IN THE BACK OF THE HOUSE WAS A WINDOW WHICH WAS NOT FASTENED BECAUSE IT WAS MUCH TOO SMALL FOR A MAN TO GET THROUGH BUT OLIVER WAS SO LITTLE THAT HE COULD DO IT EASILY
7883-113275-0044 AND WITH EVERYTHING SWIMMING BEFORE HIS EYES HE HEARD CRIES AND THE LOUD RINGING OF A BELL AND FELT SIKES DRAG HIM BACKWARD THROUGH THE WINDOW
