8543-280376-0000 ERE LONG THEY REACHED ANOTHER ISLAND WHERE DWELT A GREAT ENCHANTRESS
8543-280376-0001 WHOSE PALACE EURYLOCHUS DISCOVERED
8543-280376-0002 SO THEY CALLED TO HER AND SHE CAME FORTH AND BADE THEM ENTER HEEDLESSLY THEY FOLLOWED HER ALL BUT EURYLOCHUS
8543-280376-0003 AND THEY WERE TURNED INTO SWINE WHEN ODYSSEUS HEARD WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIS MEN HE WAS VERY ANGRY AND WOULD HAVE SLAIN HER WITH HIS SWORD
8543-280376-0004 SHEATHE THY SWORD I PRAY THEE ODYSSEUS AND LET US BE AT PEACE THEN SAID ODYSSEUS
8543-280376-0005 AND TO LET HIM RETURN IN SAFETY TO HIS HOME THEN SHE OPENED THE DOORS OF THE STY AND WAVED HER WAND AND THE SWINE BECAME MEN AGAIN EVEN HANDSOMER AND STRONGER THAN BEFORE FOR A WHOLE YEAR ODYSSEUS AND HIS MEN STAYED IN THE PALACE
8543-280376-0006 FEASTING AND RESTING WHEN THEY AT LAST SET SAIL AGAIN THE SORCERESS TOLD ODYSSEUS OF MANY DANGERS HE WOULD MEET ON HIS HOMEWARD VOYAGE AND WARNED HIM HOW TO ESCAPE FROM THEM IN AN ISLAND IN THE BLUE SEA
8543-280376-0007 THROUGH WHICH THE SHIP OF ODYSSEUS WOULD SAIL TOWARD HOME LIVED SOME BEAUTIFUL MERMAIDS CALLED SIRENS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE SIRENS FACES WERE THEIR LOVELY VOICES BY WHICH THEY LURED MEN TO GO ON SHORE AND THERE SLEW THEM
8543-280376-0008 IN THE FLOWERY MEADOWS WERE THE BONES OF THE FOOLISH SAILORS WHO HAD SEEN ONLY THE LOVELY FACES AND LONG GOLDEN HAIR OF THE SIRENS AND HAD LOST THEIR HEARTS TO THEM
8543-280376-0009 FOLLOWING HER ADVICE HE FILLED THE EARS OF THE MEN WITH WAX AND BADE THEM BIND HIM HAND AND FOOT TO THE MAST PAST THE ISLAND DROVE THE SHIP AND THE SIRENS SEEING IT BEGAN THEIR SWEET SONG
8543-280376-0010 COME HITHER COME HITHER BRAVE ODYSSEUS THEY SANG THEN ODYSSEUS TRIED TO MAKE HIS MEN UNBIND HIM BUT EURYLOCHUS AND ANOTHER BOUND HIM YET MORE TIGHTLY TO THE MAST WHEN THE ISLAND WAS LEFT BEHIND
8543-280376-0011 THE MEN TOOK THE WAX FROM THEIR EARS AND UNBOUND THEIR CAPTAIN AFTER PASSING THE WANDERING ROCKS WITH THEIR TERRIBLE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS THE SHIP CAME TO A PLACE OF GREAT PERIL BEYOND THEM WERE YET TWO HUGE ROCKS BETWEEN WHICH THE SEA SWEPT
8543-280376-0012 ONE OF THESE RAN UP TO THE SKY AND IN THIS CLIFF WAS A DARK CAVE IN WHICH LIVED SCYLLA A HORRIBLE MONSTER WHO AS THE SHIP PASSED SEIZED SIX OF THE MEN WITH HER SIX DREADFUL HEADS
8543-280376-0013 BUT ODYSSEUS ESCAPED ON A BROKEN PIECE OF WRECKAGE TO THE SHORES OF AN ISLAND ON THIS ISLAND LIVED CALYPSO OF THE BRAIDED TRESSES A GODDESS FEARED BY ALL MEN BUT TO ODYSSEUS SHE WAS VERY KIND AND HE SOON BECAME AS STRONG AS EVER
8543-280376-0014 SOME DAY THOU WILT MARRY NAUSICAA SHE SAID
8543-280376-0015 TO MORROW THOU MUST ASK THE KING THY FATHER FOR MULES AND FOR A WAGON AND DRIVE FROM THE CITY TO A PLACE WHERE ALL THE RICH CLOTHING MAY BE WASHED AND DRIED WHEN MORNING CAME NAUSICAA REMEMBERED HER DREAM
8543-280376-0016 AND WENT TO TELL HER FATHER HER MOTHER WAS SITTING SPINNING YARN OF SEA PURPLE STAIN AND HER FATHER WAS JUST GOING TO A COUNCIL MEETING FATHER DEAR SAID THE PRINCESS COULDST THOU LEND ME A HIGH WAGON WITH STRONG WHEELS
8543-280376-0017 ALL YOURS TOO I SHALL TAKE SO THAT THOU SHALT GO TO THE COUNCIL IN LINEN THAT IS SNOWY CLEAN AND I KNOW THAT MY FIVE BROTHERS WILL ALSO BE GLAD IF I WASH THEIR FINE CLOTHING FOR THEM
8543-280376-0018 THIS SHE SAID FOR SHE FELT TOO SHY TO TELL HER FATHER WHAT ATHENE HAD SAID ABOUT HER GETTING MARRIED BUT THE KING KNEW WELL WHY SHE ASKED I DO NOT GRUDGE THEE MULES NOR ANYTHING ELSE MY CHILD HE SAID
8543-280376-0019 GO BID THE SERVANTS PREPARE A WAGON THE SERVANTS QUICKLY GOT READY THE FINEST WAGON THAT THE KING HAD AND HARNESSED THE BEST OF THE MULES AND NAUSICAA'S MOTHER FILLED A BASKET WITH ALL THE DAINTIES THAT SHE KNEW HER DAUGHTER LIKED BEST
8543-280376-0020 SO THAT NAUSICAA AND HER MAIDENS MIGHT FEAST TOGETHER THE FINE CLOTHES WERE PILED INTO THE WAGON THE BASKET OF FOOD WAS PLACED CAREFULLY BESIDE THEM AND NAUSICAA CLIMBED IN TOOK THE WHIP AND SHINING REINS AND TOUCHED THE MULES
8543-280376-0021 THEN WITH CLATTER OF HOOFS THEY STARTED WHEN THEY WERE COME TO THE BEAUTIFUL CLEAR RIVER AMONGST WHOSE REEDS ODYSSEUS HAD KNELT THE DAY BEFORE
8543-280376-0022 THEY UNHARNESSED THE MULES AND DROVE THEM ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RIVER TO GRAZE WHERE THE CLOVER GREW RICH AND FRAGRANT THEN THEY WASHED THE CLOTHES WORKING HARD AND WELL AND SPREAD THEM OUT TO DRY ON THE CLEAN PEBBLES DOWN BY THE SEASHORE
8543-280376-0023 THEN THEY BATHED AND WHEN THEY HAD BATHED THEY TOOK THEIR MIDDAY MEAL BY THE BANK OF THE RIPPLING RIVER WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED THE SUN HAD NOT YET DRIED THE CLOTHES SO NAUSICAA AND HER MAIDENS BEGAN TO PLAY BALL
8543-280376-0024 AS THEY PLAYED THEY SANG A SONG THAT THE GIRLS OF THAT LAND WOULD ALWAYS SING AS THEY THREW THE BALL TO ONE ANOTHER ALL THE MAIDENS WERE FAIR BUT NAUSICAA OF THE WHITE ARMS WAS THE FAIREST OF ALL FROM HAND TO HAND
8543-280376-0025 GROWING ALWAYS THE MERRIER UNTIL WHEN IT WAS NEARLY TIME FOR THEM TO GATHER THE CLOTHES TOGETHER AND GO HOME NAUSICAA THREW IT VERY HARD TO ONE OF THE OTHERS THE GIRL MISSED THE CATCH
8543-280376-0026 THE BALL FLEW INTO THE RIVER AND AS IT WAS SWEPT AWAY TO THE SEA THE PRINCESS AND ALL HER MAIDENS SCREAMED ALOUD THEIR CRIES AWOKE ODYSSEUS AS HE LAY ASLEEP IN HIS BED OF LEAVES I MUST BE NEAR THE HOUSES OF MEN HE SAID
8543-280376-0027 THOSE ARE THE CRIES OF GIRLS AT PLAY WITH THAT HE CREPT OUT FROM THE SHELTER OF THE OLIVE TREES HE HAD NO CLOTHES FOR HE HAD THROWN THEM ALL INTO THE SEA BEFORE HE BEGAN HIS TERRIBLE SWIM FOR LIFE
8543-280376-0028 BUT HE BROKE OFF SOME LEAFY BRANCHES AND HELD THEM ROUND HIM AND WALKED DOWN TO WHERE NAUSICAA AND HER MAIDENS WERE LIKE A WILD MAN OF THE WOODS HE LOOKED AND WHEN THEY SAW HIM COMING THE GIRLS SHRIEKED AND RAN AWAY
8543-280376-0029 BUT ALTHOUGH HIS FACE WAS MARRED WITH THE SEA FOAM THAT HAD CRUSTED ON IT AND HE LOOKED A TERRIBLE FIERCE GREAT CREATURE NAUSICAA WAS TOO BRAVE TO RUN AWAY
8543-280376-0030 SHAKING SHE STOOD THERE AND WATCHED HIM AS HE CAME FORWARD AND STOOD STILL A LITTLE WAY OFF THEN ODYSSEUS SPOKE TO HER GENTLY AND KINDLY THAT HE MIGHT TAKE AWAY HER FEAR
8543-280376-0031 HE TOLD HER OF HIS SHIPWRECK AND BEGGED HER TO SHOW HIM THE WAY TO THE TOWN AND GIVE HIM SOME OLD GARMENT OR ANY OLD WRAP IN WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT THE LINEN SO THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING BESIDES LEAVES WITH WHICH TO COVER HIMSELF
8543-280376-0032 I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY MAIDEN HALF SO BEAUTIFUL AS THOU ART HE SAID HAVE PITY ON ME AND MAY THE GODS GRANT THEE ALL THY HEART'S DESIRE THEN SAID NAUSICAA
8543-280376-0033 THOU SEEMEST NO EVIL MAN STRANGER AND I WILL GLADLY GIVE THEE CLOTHING AND SHOW THEE THE WAY TO TOWN
8543-280376-0034 AND MY FATHER IS THE KING TO HER MAIDENS THEN SHE CALLED WHY DO YE RUN AWAY AT THE SIGHT OF A MAN DOST THOU TAKE HIM FOR AN ENEMY HE IS ONLY A POOR SHIPWRECKED MAN COME GIVE HIM FOOD AND DRINK AND FETCH HIM CLOTHING
8543-280376-0035 THE MAIDENS CAME BACK FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES AND FETCHED SOME OF THE GARMENTS OF NAUSICAA'S BROTHERS WHICH THEY HAD BROUGHT TO WASH AND LAID THEM BESIDE ODYSSEUS ODYSSEUS GRATEFULLY TOOK THE CLOTHES AWAY AND WENT OFF TO THE RIVER
8543-280376-0036 THERE HE PLUNGED INTO THE CLEAR WATER AND WASHED THE SALT CRUST FROM OFF HIS FACE AND LIMBS AND BODY AND THE CRUSTED FOAM FROM HIS HAIR THEN HE PUT ON THE BEAUTIFUL GARMENTS THAT BELONGED TO ONE OF THE PRINCES AND WALKED DOWN TO THE SHORE WHERE NAUSICAA AND HER MAIDENS WERE WAITING
8543-280376-0037 SO TALL AND HANDSOME AND STRONG DID ODYSSEUS LOOK WITH HIS HAIR CURLING LIKE HYACINTH FLOWERS AROUND HIS HEAD THAT NAUSICAA SAID TO HER MAIDENS THIS MAN WHO SEEMED TO US SO DREADFUL SO SHORT A TIME AGO NOW LOOKS LIKE A GOD
8543-280376-0038 I WOULD THAT MY HUSBAND IF EVER I HAVE ONE SHOULD BE AS HE THEN SHE AND HER MAIDENS BROUGHT HIM FOOD AND WINE AND HE ATE HUNGRILY FOR IT WAS MANY DAYS SINCE HE HAD EATEN
8543-280376-0039 WHEN HE HAD FINISHED THEY PACKED THE LINEN INTO THE WAGON AND YOKED THE MULES AND NAUSICAA CLIMBED INTO HER PLACE SO LONG AS WE ARE PASSING THROUGH THE FIELDS SHE SAID TO ODYSSEUS FOLLOW BEHIND WITH MY MAIDENS AND I WILL LEAD THE WAY
8543-280376-0040 BUT WHEN WE COME NEAR THE TOWN WITH ITS HIGH WALLS AND TOWERS AND HARBORS FULL OF SHIPS THE ROUGH SAILORS WILL STARE AND SAY HATH NAUSICAA GONE TO FIND HERSELF A HUSBAND
8543-280376-0041 WHO WOULD WED HER HATH SHE PICKED UP A SHIPWRECKED STRANGER OR IS THIS ONE OF THE GODS WHO HAS COME TO MAKE HER HIS WIFE THEREFORE COME NOT WITH US I PRAY THEE FOR THE SAILORS TO JEST AT

8543-280376-0045 THEN MY FATHER IS SURE TO HELP THEE TO GET SAFELY BACK TO THINE OWN LAND THEN NAUSICAA SMOTE HER MULES WITH THE WHIP AND THEY TROTTED QUICKLY OFF
8543-280376-0046 WITH ITS WHISPERING REEDS AND THE BEACH WITH ITS YELLOW SAND ODYSSEUS AND THE MAIDENS FOLLOWED THE WAGON AND JUST AS THE SUN WAS SETTING THEY REACHED THE POPLAR GROVE IN THE MEADOW
8543-280376-0047 THERE ODYSSEUS STAYED UNTIL NAUSICAA SHOULD HAVE HAD TIME TO REACH THE PALACE WHEN SHE GOT THERE SHE STOPPED AT THE GATEWAY AND HER BROTHERS CAME OUT AND LIFTED DOWN THE LINEN AND UNHARNESSED THE MULES NAUSICAA WENT UP TO HER ROOM
8543-280376-0048 AND HER OLD NURSE KINDLED A FIRE FOR HER AND GOT READY HER SUPPER WHEN ODYSSEUS THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO FOLLOW HE WENT TO THE CITY HE MARVELED AT THE GREAT WALLS AND AT THE MANY GALLANT SHIPS IN THE HARBORS
8543-280376-0049 BUT WHEN HE REACHED THE KING'S PALACE HE WONDERED STILL MORE ITS WALLS WERE OF BRASS SO THAT FROM WITHOUT WHEN THE DOORS STOOD OPEN IT LOOKED AS IF THE SUN OR MOON WERE SHINING WITHIN A FRIEZE OF BLUE RAN ROUND THE WALLS
8543-280376-0050 ALL THE DOORS WERE MADE OF GOLD THE DOORPOSTS WERE OF SILVER THE THRESHOLDS OF BRASS AND THE HOOK OF THE DOOR WAS OF GOLD IN THE HALLS WERE GOLDEN FIGURES OF ANIMALS
8543-280376-0051 AND OF MEN WHO HELD IN THEIR HANDS LIGHTED TORCHES OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD WAS A GREAT GARDEN FILLED WITH BLOSSOMING PEAR TREES AND POMEGRANATES AND APPLE TREES WITH SHINING FRUIT AND FIGS AND OLIVES
8543-280376-0052 ALL THE YEAR ROUND THERE WAS FRUIT IN THAT GARDEN THERE WERE GRAPES IN BLOSSOM AND GRAPES PURPLE AND READY TO EAT
8543-280376-0053 AND GOLDEN RIPE PEARS AND ROSY APPLES AT ALL OF THOSE WONDERS ODYSSEUS STOOD AND GAZED BUT IT WAS NOT FOR LONG FOR HE HASTENED THROUGH THE HALLS TO WHERE THE QUEEN SAT IN THE FIRELIGHT SPINNING HER PURPLE YARN
8543-280376-0054 HE FELL AT HER KNEES AND SILENCE CAME ON ALL THOSE IN THE ROOM WHEN THEY LOOKED AT HIM SO BRAVE AND SO HANDSOME DID HE SEEM
8543-280376-0055 MY PARTING RIGHT QUICKLY THAT I MAY COME TO MINE OWN COUNTRY TOO LONG HAVE I SUFFERED GREAT SORROWS FAR AWAY FROM MY OWN FRIENDS THEN HE SAT DOWN AMONGST THE ASHES BY THE FIRE AND FOR A LITTLE SPACE NO ONE SPOKE
8543-280376-0056 BID HIM ARISE AND GIVE HIM MEAT AND DRINK
8543-280376-0057 HE MADE ONE OF HIS SONS GIVE UP HIS SILVER INLAID CHAIR AND BADE HIS SERVANTS FETCH A SILVER BASIN AND A GOLDEN EWER
8543-280376-0058 AND THE LORDS AND THE COURTIERS WHO WERE THERE FEASTED ALONG WITH ODYSSEUS UNTIL IT WAS TIME FOR THEM TO GO TO THEIR OWN HOMES BEFORE THEY WENT THE KING PROMISED ODYSSEUS A SAFE CONVOY BACK TO HIS OWN LAND
8543-280376-0059 WHEN HE WAS LEFT ALONE WITH THE KING AND QUEEN THE LATTER SAID TO HIM TELL US WHO THOU ART I MYSELF MADE THE CLOTHING THAT THOU WEAREST FROM WHENCE DIDST THOU GET IT THEN ODYSSEUS TOLD HER OF HIS IMPRISONMENT IN THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO
8543-280376-0060 OF HIS ESCAPE OF THE TERRIBLE STORM THAT SHATTERED HIS RAFT AND OF HOW AT LENGTH HE REACHED THE SHORE AND MET WITH NAUSICAA IT WAS WRONG OF MY DAUGHTER NOT TO BRING THEE TO THE PALACE WHEN SHE CAME WITH HER MAIDS SAID THE KING
8543-280376-0061 BUT ODYSSEUS TOLD HIM WHY IT WAS THAT NAUSICAA HAD BADE HIM STAY BEHIND BE NOT VEXED WITH THIS BLAMELESS MAIDEN HE SAID TRULY SHE IS THE SWEETEST AND THE FAIREST MAIDEN I EVER SAW
8543-280376-0062 THEN ODYSSEUS WENT TO THE BED THAT THE SERVANTS HAD PREPARED FOR HIM THEY HAD SPREAD FAIR PURPLE BLANKETS OVER IT AND WHEN IT WAS READY THEY STOOD BESIDE IT WITH THEIR TORCHES BLAZING GOLDEN AND RED
8543-280376-0063 SLEEP WAS VERY SWEET TO ODYSSEUS THAT NIGHT AS HE LAY IN THE SOFT BED WITH WARM BLANKETS OVER HIM HE WAS NO LONGER TOSSED AND BEATEN BY ANGRY SEAS NO LONGER WET AND COLD AND HUNGRY
8543-280376-0064 THE ROAR OF FURIOUS WAVES DID NOT BEAT IN HIS EARS FOR ALL WAS STILL IN THE GREAT HALLS WHERE THE FLICKERING FIRELIGHT PLAYED ON THE FRIEZE OF BLUE AND TURNED THE BRASS WALLS INTO GOLD
8543-280376-0065 NEXT DAY THE KING GAVE A GREAT ENTERTAINMENT FOR ODYSSEUS THERE WERE BOXING AND WRESTLING AND LEAPING AND RUNNING AND IN ALL OF THESE THE BROTHERS OF NAUSICAA WERE BETTER THAN ALL OTHERS WHO TRIED BUT WHEN THEY CAME TO THROW THE WEIGHT
8543-280376-0066 AND BEGGED ODYSSEUS TO TRY HE CAST A STONE HEAVIER THAN ALL OTHERS FAR BEYOND WHERE THE PHAEACIANS HAD THROWN THAT NIGHT
8543-280376-0067 AND ODYSSEUS LISTENED UNTIL HIS HEART COULD BEAR NO MORE AND TEARS TRICKLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS ONLY THE KING SAW HIM WEEP HE WONDERED MUCH WHY ODYSSEUS WEPT AND AT LAST HE ASKED HIM SO ODYSSEUS TOLD THE KING HIS NAME
8543-280376-0068 AND THE WHOLE STORY OF HIS ADVENTURES SINCE HE HAD SAILED AWAY FROM TROYLAND THEN THE KING AND QUEEN AND THEIR COURTIERS GAVE RICH GIFTS TO ODYSSEUS A BEAUTIFUL SILVER STUDDED SWORD WAS THE KING'S GIFT TO HIM
8543-280376-0069 NAUSICAA GAVE HIM NOTHING BUT SHE STOOD AND GAZED AT HIM IN HIS PURPLE ROBES AND FELT MORE SURE THAN EVER THAT HE WAS THE HANDSOMEST AND THE GREATEST HERO SHE HAD EVER SEEN FAREWELL STRANGER SHE SAID TO HIM
8543-280376-0070 WHEN THE HOUR CAME FOR HER TO GO TO BED FOR SHE KNEW SHE WOULD NOT SEE HIM ON THE MORROW FAREWELL STRANGER
8543-280376-0071 THEN SAID ODYSSEUS ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE I SHALL REMEMBER THEE NAUSICAA FOR THOU HAST GIVEN ME MY LIFE NEXT DAY A COMPANY OF THE PHAEACIANS WENT DOWN TO A SHIP THAT LAY BY THE SEASHORE
8543-280376-0072 AND WITH THEM WENT ODYSSEUS THEY CARRIED THE TREASURES THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HIM AND PUT THEM ON BOARD AND SPREAD A RUG ON THE DECK FOR HIM THERE ODYSSEUS LAY DOWN AND AS SOON AS THE SPLASH OF THE OARS IN THE WATER
8543-280376-0073 AND THE RUSH AND GUSH OF THE WATER FROM THE BOW OF THE BOAT TOLD HIM THAT THE SHIP WAS SAILING SPEEDILY TO HIS DEAR LAND OF ITHACA HE FELL INTO A SOUND SLEEP ONWARD WENT THE SHIP
8543-280376-0074 SO SWIFTLY THAT NOT EVEN A HAWK FLYING AFTER ITS PREY COULD HAVE KEPT PACE WITH HER WHEN THE BRIGHT MORNING STARS AROSE THEY WERE CLOSE TO ITHACA
8543-280376-0075 AND GENTLY CARRIED THE SLEEPING ODYSSEUS WRAPPED ROUND IN HIS RUG OF BRIGHT PURPLE TO WHERE A GREAT OLIVE TREE BENT ITS GRAY LEAVES OVER THE SAND THEY LAID HIM UNDER THE TREE PUT HIS TREASURES BESIDE HIM AND LEFT HIM STILL HEAVY WITH SLUMBER
