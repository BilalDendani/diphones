596-127685-0000 ENTERING THE VALLEY GAZING OVERWHELMED WITH THE MULTITUDE OF GRAND OBJECTS ABOUT US PERHAPS THE FIRST TO FIX OUR ATTENTION WILL BE THE BRIDAL VEIL A BEAUTIFUL WATERFALL ON OUR RIGHT ITS BROW
596-127685-0001 CLAD IN GAUZY SUN SIFTED SPRAY HALF FALLING HALF FLOATING IT SEEMS INFINITELY GENTLE AND FINE BUT THE HYMNS IT SINGS
596-127685-0002 THE BRIDAL VEIL SHOOTS FREE FROM THE UPPER EDGE OF THE CLIFF BY THE VELOCITY THE STREAM HAS ACQUIRED IN DESCENDING A LONG SLOPE ABOVE THE HEAD OF THE FALL LOOKING FROM THE TOP OF THE ROCK AVALANCHE TALUS ON THE WEST SIDE
596-127685-0003 AMONG THESE FLAT TOPPED PILLARS KISSING AND PLASHING NOTES AS WELL AS THUNDER LIKE DETONATIONS ARE PRODUCED LIKE THOSE OF THE YOSEMITE FALL THOUGH ON A SMALLER SCALE THE RAINBOWS OF THE VEIL
596-127685-0004 AND ALSO FOR A LUXURIANT GROWTH OF GRASS AND MAIDEN HAIR ON THE SIDE OF THE TALUS WHICH LOWER DOWN IS PLANTED WITH OAK LAUREL AND WILLOWS GENERAL FEATURES OF THE VALLEY
596-127685-0005 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VALLEY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE THE BRIDAL VEIL THERE IS ANOTHER FINE FALL CONSIDERABLY WIDER THAN THE VEIL WHEN THE SNOW IS MELTING FAST AND MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND FEET IN HEIGHT MEASURED FROM THE BROW OF THE CLIFF
596-127685-0006 WHERE IT FIRST SPRINGS OUT INTO THE AIR TO THE HEAD OF THE ROCKY TALUS ON WHICH IT STRIKES AND IS BROKEN UP INTO RAGGED CASCADES IT IS CALLED THE RIBBON FALL OR VIRGIN'S TEARS DURING THE SPRING FLOODS IT IS A MAGNIFICENT OBJECT
596-127685-0007 BUT THE SUFFOCATING BLASTS OF SPRAY THAT FILL THE RECESS IN THE WALL WHICH IT OCCUPIES PREVENT A NEAR APPROACH IN AUTUMN HOWEVER WHEN ITS FEEBLE CURRENT FALLS IN A SHOWER IT MAY THEN PASS FOR TEARS
596-127685-0008 WITH THE SENTIMENTAL ONLOOKER FRESH FROM A VISIT TO THE BRIDAL VEIL JUST BEYOND THIS GLORIOUS FLOOD THE EL CAPITAN ROCK REGARDED BY MANY AS THE MOST SUBLIME FEATURE OF THE VALLEY
596-127685-0009 IS SEEN THROUGH THE PINE GROVES STANDING FORWARD BEYOND THE GENERAL LINE OF THE WALL IN MOST IMPOSING GRANDEUR A TYPE OF PERMANENCE IT IS THIRTY THREE HUNDRED FEET HIGH A PLAIN
596-127685-0010 SEVERELY SIMPLE GLACIER SCULPTURED FACE OF GRANITE THE END OF ONE OF THE MOST COMPACT AND ENDURING OF THE MOUNTAIN RIDGES UNRIVALED IN HEIGHT AND BREADTH AND FLAWLESS STRENGTH
596-127685-0011 ACROSS THE VALLEY FROM HERE NEXT TO THE BRIDAL VEIL ARE THE PICTURESQUE CATHEDRAL ROCKS NEARLY TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED FEET HIGH MAKING A NOBLE DISPLAY OF FINE YET MASSIVE SCULPTURE
596-127685-0012 NEXT TO THE CATHEDRAL ROCKS ON THE SOUTH SIDE TOWERS THE SENTINEL ROCK TO A HEIGHT OF MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND FEET A TELLING MONUMENT OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD
596-127685-0013 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE THE SENTINEL ARE THE THREE BROTHERS AN IMMENSE MOUNTAIN MASS WITH THREE GABLES FRONTING THE VALLEY ONE ABOVE ANOTHER THE TOPMOST GABLE NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND FEET HIGH
596-127685-0014 SAUNTERING UP THE VALLEY THROUGH MEADOW AND GROVE IN THE COMPANY OF THESE MAJESTIC ROCKS WHICH SEEM TO FOLLOW US AS WE ADVANCE GAZING ADMIRING LOOKING FOR NEW WONDERS AHEAD WHERE ALL ABOUT US IS SO WONDERFUL
596-127685-0015 THE THUNDER OF THE YOSEMITE FALL IS HEARD AND WHEN WE ARRIVE IN FRONT OF THE SENTINEL ROCK IT IS REVEALED IN ALL ITS GLORY FROM BASE TO SUMMIT HALF A MILE IN HEIGHT
596-127685-0016 AND SEEMING TO SPRING OUT INTO THE VALLEY SUNSHINE DIRECT FROM THE SKY BUT EVEN THIS FALL PERHAPS THE MOST WONDERFUL OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD CANNOT AT FIRST HOLD OUR ATTENTION FOR NOW THE WIDE UPPER PORTION OF THE VALLEY IS DISPLAYED TO VIEW
596-127685-0017 WITH THE FINELY MODELED NORTH DOME THE ROYAL ARCHES AND WASHINGTON COLUMN ON OUR LEFT GLACIER POINT WITH ITS MASSIVE MAGNIFICENT SCULPTURE ON THE RIGHT AND IN THE MIDDLE DIRECTLY IN FRONT
596-127685-0018 LOOMS TISSIACK OR HALF DOME THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND MOST SUBLIME OF ALL THE WONDERFUL YOSEMITE ROCKS RISING IN SERENE MAJESTY FROM FLOWERY GROVES AND MEADOWS
596-127685-0019 THE UPPER CANYONS HERE THE VALLEY DIVIDES INTO THREE BRANCHES THE TENAYA NEVADA AND ILLILOUETTE CANYONS EXTENDING BACK INTO THE FOUNTAINS OF THE HIGH SIERRA
596-127685-0020 WITH SCENERY EVERY WAY WORTHY THE RELATION THEY BEAR TO YOSEMITE IN THE SOUTH BRANCH A MILE OR TWO FROM THE MAIN VALLEY IS THE ILLILOUETTE FALL SIX HUNDRED FEET HIGH ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALL THE YOSEMITE CHOIR
596-127685-0021 BUT TO MOST PEOPLE INACCESSIBLE AS YET ON ACCOUNT OF ITS ROUGH STEEP BOULDER CHOKED CANYON
596-127685-0022 WHILE ITS BROAD OPEN BASIN BETWEEN ITS FOUNTAIN MOUNTAINS AND CANYON IS NOTED FOR THE BEAUTY OF ITS LAKES AND FORESTS AND MAGNIFICENT MORAINES RETURNING TO THE VALLEY AND GOING UP THE NORTH BRANCH OF TENAYA CANYON
596-127685-0023 WE PASS BETWEEN THE NORTH DOME AND HALF DOME AND IN LESS THAN AN HOUR COME TO MIRROR LAKE THE DOME CASCADE AND TENAYA FALL
596-127685-0024 ON THE SOUTH THE VAST GRANITE WAVE OF CLOUDS REST A MILE IN HEIGHT AND BETWEEN THEM THE FINE TENAYA CASCADE WITH SILVERY PLUMES OUTSPREAD ON SMOOTH GLACIER POLISHED FOLDS OF GRANITE
596-127685-0025 MAKING A VERTICAL DESCENT IN ALL OF ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FEET JUST BEYOND THE DOME CASCADES ON THE SHOULDER OF MOUNT WATKINS THERE IS AN OLD TRAIL ONCE USED BY INDIANS ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RANGE TO MONO BUT IN THE CANYON ABOVE THIS POINT
596-127685-0026 THERE IS NO TRAIL OF ANY SORT BETWEEN MOUNT WATKINS AND CLOUDS REST THE CANYON IS ACCESSIBLE ONLY TO MOUNTAINEERS AND IT IS SO DANGEROUS THAT I HESITATE TO ADVISE EVEN GOOD CLIMBERS ANXIOUS TO TEST THEIR NERVE AND SKILL
596-127685-0027 TO ATTEMPT TO PASS THROUGH IT BEYOND THE CASCADES NO GREAT DIFFICULTY WILL BE ENCOUNTERED A SUCCESSION OF CHARMING LILY GARDENS AND MEADOWS OCCURS IN FILLED UP LAKE BASINS AMONG THE ROCK WAVES IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CANYON
596-127685-0028 AND EVERYWHERE THE SURFACE OF THE GRANITE HAS A SMOOTH WIPED APPEARANCE AND IN MANY PLACES REFLECTS THE SUNBEAMS LIKE GLASS A PHENOMENON DUE TO GLACIAL ACTION THE CANYON HAVING BEEN THE CHANNEL OF ONE OF THE MAIN TRIBUTARIES
596-127685-0029 OF THE ANCIENT YOSEMITE GLACIER ABOUT TEN MILES ABOVE THE VALLEY WE COME TO THE BEAUTIFUL TENAYA LAKE AND HERE THE CANYON TERMINATES A MILE OR TWO ABOVE THE LAKE STANDS THE GRAND SIERRA CATHEDRAL
596-127685-0030 A BUILDING OF ONE STONE SEWN FROM THE LIVING ROCK WITH SIDES ROOF GABLE SPIRE AND ORNAMENTAL PINNACLES FASHIONED AND FINISHED SYMMETRICALLY LIKE A WORK OF ART AND SET ON A WELL GRADED PLATEAU
596-127685-0031 ABOUT NINE THOUSAND FEET HIGH AS IF NATURE IN MAKING SO FINE A BUILDING HAD ALSO BEEN CAREFUL THAT IT SHOULD BE FINELY SEEN FROM EVERY DIRECTION ITS PECULIAR FORM AND GRACEFUL MAJESTIC BEAUTY OF EXPRESSION
596-127685-0032 NEVER FAIL TO CHARM ITS HEIGHT FROM ITS BASE TO THE RIDGE OF THE ROOF
596-127685-0033 PASSING THE CATHEDRAL WE DESCEND INTO THE DELIGHTFUL SPACIOUS TUOLUMNE VALLEY FROM WHICH EXCURSIONS MAY BE MADE TO MOUNTS DANA LYELL RITTER CONNESS AND MONO LAKE
596-127685-0034 AND TO THE BIG TUOLUMNE CANYON WITH ITS GLORIOUS ABUNDANCE OF ROCK AND FALLING GLIDING TOSSING WATER FOR ALL THESE THE BEAUTIFUL MEADOWS NEAR THE SODA SPRINGS FORM A DELIGHTFUL CENTER
596-127685-0035 NATURAL FEATURES NEAR THE VALLEY RETURNING NOW TO YOSEMITE AND ASCENDING THE MIDDLE OR NEVADA BRANCH OF THE VALLEY
596-127685-0036 WE COME WITHIN A FEW MILES TO THE VERNAL AND NEVADA FALLS FOUR HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED FEET HIGH
596-127685-0037 TO BE FOUND IN ALL THE WORLD TRACING THE RIVER BEYOND THE HEAD OF THE NEVADA FALL WE ARE LEAD INTO THE LITTLE YOSEMITE A VALLEY LIKE THE GREAT YOSEMITE IN FORM SCULPTURE AND VEGETATION
596-127685-0038 IT IS ABOUT THREE MILES LONG WITH WALLS FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND FEET HIGH CASCADES COMING OVER THEM
596-127685-0039 IN TRANQUIL RICHLY EMBOWERED REACHES BEYOND THIS LITTLE YOSEMITE IN THE MAIN CANYON THERE ARE THREE OTHER LITTLE YOSEMITES THE HIGHEST SITUATED A FEW MILES BELOW THE BASE OF MOUNT LYELL
596-127685-0040 AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE SEA TO DESCRIBE THESE WITH ALL THEIR WEALTH OF YOSEMITE FURNITURE AND THE WILDERNESS OF LOFTY PEAKS ABOVE THEM THE HOME OF THE AVALANCHE AND TREASURY OF THE FOUNTAIN SNOW
596-127685-0041 WOULD TAKE US FAR BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF A SINGLE BOOK NOR CAN WE HERE CONSIDER THE FORMATION OF THESE MOUNTAIN LANDSCAPES HOW THE CRYSTAL ROCK WERE BROUGHT TO LIGHT BY GLACIERS MADE UP OF CRYSTAL SNOW MAKING BEAUTY
596-127685-0042 WHOSE INFLUENCE IS SO MYSTERIOUS ON EVERY ONE WHO SEES IT OF THE SMALL GLACIER LAKES SO CHARACTERISTIC OF THESE UPPER REGIONS THERE ARE NO FEWER THAN SIXTY SEVEN IN THE BASIN OF THE MAIN MIDDLE BRANCH BESIDES COUNTLESS SMALLER POOLS
596-127685-0043 MAKING A GRAND TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN LAKES WHOSE WATERS COME TO SING AT YOSEMITE SO GLORIOUS IS THE BACKGROUND OF THE GREAT VALLEY SO HARMONIOUS ITS RELATIONS TO ITS WIDESPREADING FOUNTAINS
596-127685-0044 ON THE SOUTH SIDE TO THE FOUNTAINS OF THE BRIDAL VEIL CREEK THE BASIN OF WHICH IS NOTED FOR THE BEAUTY OF ITS MEADOWS AND ITS SUPERB FORESTS OF SILVER FIR ON THE NORTH SIDE
596-127685-0045 USUALLY WELL FRINGED WITH SHRUBS AND TREES AND PRESENTING THE POLISHED SURFACES GIVEN THEM BY THE GLACIER THAT BROUGHT THEM INTO RELIEF ON THE UPPER PORTION OF THE BASIN BROAD MORAINE BEDS HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED AND ON THESE
596-127685-0046 FINE THRIFTY FORESTS ARE GROWING LAKES AND MEADOWS AND SMALL SPONGY BOGS MAY BE FOUND HIDING HERE AND THERE IN THE WOODS OR BACK IN THE FOUNTAIN RECESSES OF MOUNT HOFFMAN WHILE A THOUSAND GARDENS ARE PLANTED ALONG THE BANKS OF THE STREAMS
596-127685-0047 ALL THE WIDE FAN SHAPED UPPER PORTION OF THE BASIN IS COVERED WITH A NETWORK OF SMALL RILLS THAT GO CHEERILY ON THEIR WAY TO THEIR GRAND FALL IN THE VALLEY NOW FLOWING ON SMOOTH PAVEMENTS IN SHEETS THIN AS GLASS
596-127685-0048 NOW DIVING UNDER WILLOWS AND LAVING THEIR RED ROOTS OOZING THROUGH GREEN PLUSHY BOGS PLASHING OVER SMALL FALLS AND DANCING DOWN SLANTING CASCADES CALMING AGAIN GLIDING THROUGH PATCHES OF SMOOTH GLACIER MEADOWS
596-127685-0049 THE STREAM IS NEARLY FORTY FEET WIDE AND WHEN THE SNOW IS MELTING RAPIDLY IN THE SPRING IT IS ABOUT FOUR FEET DEEP WITH A CURRENT OF TWO AND A HALF MILES AN HOUR THIS IS ABOUT THE VOLUME OF WATER THAT FORMS THE FALL IN MAY AND JUNE
596-127685-0050 WHEN THERE HAD BEEN MUCH SNOW THE PRECEDING WINTER BUT IT VARIES GREATLY FROM MONTH TO MONTH THE SNOW RAPIDLY VANISHES FROM THE OPEN PORTION OF THE BASIN WHICH FACES SOUTHWARD AND ONLY A FEW OF THE TRIBUTARIES
596-127685-0051 THE TOTAL DESCENT MADE BY THE STREAM FROM ITS HIGHEST SOURCES
596-127685-0052 IS ABOUT SIX THOUSAND FEET WHILE THE DISTANCE IS ONLY ABOUT TEN MILES AN AVERAGE FALL OF SIX HUNDRED FEET PER MILE THE LAST MILE OF ITS COURSE
596-127685-0053 SWAYING AND SWIRLING WITH EASY GRACEFUL GESTURES AND SINGING THE LAST OF ITS MOUNTAIN SONGS BEFORE IT REACHES THE DIZZY EDGE OF YOSEMITE
596-127685-0054 INTO ANOTHER WORLD WHERE CLIMATE VEGETATION
