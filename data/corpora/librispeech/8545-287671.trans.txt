8545-287671-0028 COMING BY FREE COLORED CHILDREN WITHOUT BUYING THEM AND SELLING THEM AFTERWARDS
8545-287671-0029 BUT HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED FROM ARKANSAS HE COULD TELL ALL ABOUT HOW HE WAS KIDNAPPED BUT COULD NOT FIND ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING FOR HIM SO HE HAD TO CONTENT HIMSELF
8545-287671-0030 MC CAULLY BOUGHT ME FROM A MAN BY THE NAME OF LANDERS WHILE IN LANDERS HANDS I HAD THE RHEUMATISM AND WAS NOT ABLE TO WORK HE WAS AFRAID I WAS GOING TO DIE OR HE WOULD LOSE ME AND I WOULD NOT BE OF ANY SERVICE TO HIM
8545-287671-0031 SO HE TOOK AND TRADED ME OFF FOR A WAGON I WAS SOMETHING BETTER WHEN HE TRADED ME OFF WELL ENOUGH TO BE ABOUT MY HEALTH REMAINED BAD FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS
8545-287671-0032 AND I NEVER GOT MY HEALTH UNTIL MOORE BOUGHT ME MOORE TOOK ME FOR A DEBT
8545-287671-0033 I WAS NOT BORN IN MISSOURI BUT WAS BORN IN VIRGINIA FROM MY EARLIEST MEMORY I WAS OWNED BY CONRAD HACKLER HE LIVED IN GRASON COUNTY
8545-287671-0034 HE WAS A VERY POOR MAN AND HAD NO OTHER SLAVE BUT ME HE BOUGHT ME BEFORE I WAS QUITE FOUR YEARS OLD FOR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS HACKLER BOUGHT ME FROM A MAN NAMED WILLIAM SCOTT
8545-287671-0035 I MUST GO BACK BY GOOD RIGHTS TO THE BEGINNING AND TELL ALL SCOTT BOUGHT ME FIRST FROM A YOUNG MAN HE MET ONE DAY IN THE ROAD WITH A BUNDLE IN HIS ARMS SCOTT
8545-287671-0036 WISHING TO KNOW OF THE YOUNG MAN WHAT HE HAD IN HIS BUNDLE WAS TOLD THAT HE HAD A BABY
8545-287671-0037 THAT ITS MOTHER WAS DEAD AND IT HAD NOBODY TO TAKE CARE OF IT SCOTT OFFERED THE YOUNG MAN A HORSE FOR IT AND THE YOUNG MAN TOOK HIM UP THIS IS THE WAY I WAS TOLD THAT SCOTT CAME BY ME
8545-287671-0038 I NEVER KNOWED ANYTHING ABOUT MY MOTHER OR FATHER BUT I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT MY MOTHER WAS A WHITE WOMAN AND THAT I WAS PUT AWAY TO SAVE HER CHARACTER
8545-287671-0039 UNDER HACKLER I WAS TREATED MORE LIKE A BRUTE THAN A HUMAN BEING I WAS FED LIKE THE DOGS
8545-287671-0040 STANDING OFF SOME DISTANCE FROM THE MAIN HOUSE WHERE MY MASTER AND MISTRESS LIVED A BED OF STRAW AND OLD RAGS WAS MADE FOR ME IN A BIG TROUGH CALLED THE TAN TROUGH
8545-287671-0041 A TROUGH HAVING BEEN USED FOR TANNING PURPOSES THE CATS ABOUT THE PLACE CAME AND SLEPT WITH ME AND WAS ALL THE COMPANY I HAD I HAD TO WORK WITH THE HOE IN THE FIELD AND HELP DO EVERYTHING IN DOORS
8545-287671-0042 AND OUT IN ALL WEATHERS THE PLACE WAS SO POOR THAT SOME SEASONS HE WOULD NOT RAISE TWENTY BUSHELS OF CORN AND HARDLY THREE BUSHELS OF WHEAT AS FOR SHOES
8545-287671-0043 AFTER I GROWED UP TO BE A WOMAN MY MASTER THOUGHT NOTHING OF TAKING MY CLOTHES OFF AND WOULD WHIP ME UNTIL THE BLOOD WOULD RUN DOWN TO THE GROUND
8545-287671-0044 THEY DID NOT TREAT ME SO BAD THEY BOTH PROFESSED TO GET RELIGION ABOUT THAT TIME AND MY MASTER SAID HE WOULD NEVER LAY THE WEIGHT OF HIS FINGER ON ME AGAIN
8545-287671-0045 I WOULD HAVE BEEN HIRED OUT OR SOLD BUT MY MISTRESS WANTED TO KEEP ME TO CARRY ON THE PLACE FOR HER SUPPORT SO I WAS KEPT FOR SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH
8545-287671-0046 I SHOULD NOT SERVE ANYBODY ELSE I DONE MY BEST TO KEEP MY MISTRESS FROM SUFFERING AFTER A FEW YEARS THEY ALL BECAME DISSATISFIED AND MOVED TO MISSOURI THEY SCATTERED AND TOOK UP GOVERNMENT LAND
8545-287671-0047 WITHOUT MEANS THEY LIVED AS POOR PEOPLE COMMONLY LIVE ON SMALL FARMS IN THE WOODS I STILL LIVED WITH MY MISTRESS SOME OF THE HEIRS GOT DISSATISFIED
8545-287671-0048 AND SUED FOR THEIR RIGHTS OR A SETTLEMENT THEN I WAS SOLD WITH MY CHILD A BOY THUS AUNT HANNAH REVIEWED HER SLAVE LIFE
8545-287671-0049 SHOWING THAT SHE HAD BEEN IN THE HANDS OF SIX DIFFERENT OWNERS AND HAD SEEN GREAT TRIBULATION UNDER EACH OF THEM
8545-287671-0050 THAT SLAVERY HAD GIVEN HER ONE CHILD BUT NO HUSBAND AS A PROTECTOR OR A FATHER THE HALF OF WHAT SHE PASSED THROUGH IN THE WAY OF SUFFERING
8545-287671-0051 HAS SCARCELY BEEN HINTED AT IN THIS SKETCH FIFTY SEVEN YEARS WERE PASSED IN BONDAGE BEFORE SHE REACHED PHILADELPHIA UNDER THE GOOD PROVIDENCE THROUGH WHICH SHE CAME IN POSSESSION OF HER FREEDOM
8545-287671-0052 SHE FOUND A KIND HOME WITH A FAMILY OF ABOLITIONISTS MISSUS GILLINGHAM'S WHOSE HEARTS HAD BEEN IN DEEP SYMPATHY WITH THE SLAVE FOR MANY YEARS IN THIS SITUATION AUNT HANNAH REMAINED
8545-287671-0053 HONEST FAITHFUL AND OBLIGING TAKING CARE OF HER EARNINGS WHICH WERE PUT OUT AT INTEREST FOR HER BY HER FRIENDS HER MIND WAS DEEPLY IMBUED WITH RELIGIOUS FEELING
8545-287671-0054 AND AN UNSHAKEN CONFIDENCE IN GOD AS HER ONLY TRUST SHE CONNECTED HERSELF WITH THE A M E BETHEL CHURCH OF PHILADELPHIA WHERE SHE HAS WALKED BLAMELESS
8545-287671-0055 AND EXEMPLARY UP TO THIS DAY PROBABLY THERE IS NOT A MEMBER IN THAT LARGE CONGREGATION WHOSE SIMPLE FAITH AND WHOSE WALK AND CONVERSATION ARE MORE COMMENDABLE THAN AUNT HANNAH'S
8545-287671-0056 ALTHOUGH SHE HAS PASSED THROUGH SO MANY HARDSHIPS SHE IS A WOMAN OF GOOD JUDGMENT
8545-287671-0057 VIGOR AND PEACE OF MIND IN HER OLD DAYS WITH A SMALL INCOME JUST SUFFICIENT TO MEET HER HUMBLE WANTS WITHOUT HAVING TO LIVE AT SERVICE AFTER LIVING IN PHILADELPHIA FOR SEVERAL YEARS
8545-287671-0058 POSSESSING ALL HER GOOD QUALITIES HAD SERVED A LIFE TIME IN A HIGHLY RESPECTABLE QUAKER FAMILY OF THIS CITY AND HAD SO WON THE ESTEEM OF HIS KIND EMPLOYER THAT AT HIS DEATH
8545-287671-0059 HE LEFT HIM A COMFORTABLE HOUSE FOR LIFE SO THAT HE WAS NOT UNDER THE NECESSITY OF SERVING ANOTHER THE NAME OF THE RECIPIENT OF THE GOOD QUAKER FRIEND'S BOUNTY AND AUNT HANNAH'S COMPANION
8545-287671-0060 WAS THOMAS TODD AFTER A FEW YEARS OF WEDDED LIFE AUNT HANNAH WAS CALLED UPON TO BE LEFT ALONE AGAIN IN THE WORLD BY THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND
