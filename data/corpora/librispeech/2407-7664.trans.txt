2407-7664-0000 OR AT THEIR POSTS AS THE COSSACKS SAY TOWARDS EVENING THAT SAME LUKASHKA THE SNATCHER ABOUT WHOM THE OLD WOMEN HAD BEEN TALKING WAS STANDING ON A WATCH TOWER OF THE NIZHNI PROTOTSK POST SITUATED ON THE VERY BANKS OF THE TEREK
2407-7664-0001 LEANING ON THE RAILING OF THE TOWER AND SCREWING UP HIS EYES
2407-7664-0002 NOW DOWN AT HIS FELLOW COSSACKS AND OCCASIONALLY HE ADDRESSED THE LATTER THE SUN WAS ALREADY APPROACHING THE SNOWY RANGE THAT GLEAMED WHITE ABOVE THE FLEECY CLOUDS THE CLOUDS UNDULATING AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAINS GREW DARKER AND DARKER
2407-7664-0003 THE CLEARNESS OF EVENING WAS NOTICEABLE IN THE AIR A SENSE OF FRESHNESS CAME FROM THE WOODS THOUGH ROUND THE POST IT WAS STILL HOT THE VOICES OF THE TALKING COSSACKS VIBRATED MORE SONOROUSLY THAN BEFORE
2407-7664-0004 THE MOVING MASS OF THE TEREK'S RAPID BROWN WATERS CONTRASTED MORE VIVIDLY WITH ITS MOTIONLESS BANKS THE WATERS WERE BEGINNING TO SUBSIDE AND HERE AND THERE THE WET SANDS GLEAMED DRAB ON THE BANKS AND IN THE SHALLOWS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER
2407-7664-0005 JUST OPPOSITE THE CORDON WAS DESERTED ONLY AN IMMENSE WASTE OF LOW GROWING REEDS STRETCHED FAR AWAY TO THE VERY FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS ON THE LOW BANK A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE COULD BE SEEN THE FLAT ROOFED CLAY HOUSES
2407-7664-0006 AND THE FUNNEL SHAPED CHIMNEYS OF A CHECHEN VILLAGE THE SHARP EYES OF THE COSSACK WHO STOOD ON THE WATCH TOWER FOLLOWED THROUGH THE EVENING SMOKE OF THE PRO RUSSIAN VILLAGE THE TINY MOVING FIGURES OF THE CHECHEN WOMEN VISIBLE IN THE DISTANCE IN THEIR RED AND BLUE GARMENTS
2407-7664-0007 ALTHOUGH THE COSSACKS EXPECTED ABREKS TO CROSS OVER AND ATTACK THEM FROM THE TARTAR SIDE AT ANY MOMENT ESPECIALLY AS IT WAS MAY WHEN THE WOODS BY THE TEREK ARE SO DENSE
2407-7664-0008 IN PLACES FOR A HORSEMAN TO FORD IT AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE A COSSACK HAD ARRIVED WITH A CIRCULAR FROM THE COMMANDER OF THE REGIMENT ANNOUNCING THAT SPIES HAD REPORTED THE INTENTION OF A PARTY OF SOME EIGHT MEN TO CROSS THE TEREK AND ORDERING SPECIAL VIGILANCE
2407-7664-0009 NO SPECIAL VIGILANCE WAS BEING OBSERVED IN THE CORDON THE COSSACKS UNARMED AND WITH THEIR HORSES UNSADDLED JUST AS IF THEY WERE AT HOME SPENT THEIR TIME SOME IN FISHING SOME IN DRINKING AND SOME IN HUNTING
2407-7664-0010 ONLY THE HORSE OF THE MAN ON DUTY WAS SADDLED AND WITH ITS FEET HOBBLED WAS MOVING ABOUT BY THE BRAMBLES NEAR THE WOOD AND ONLY THE SENTINEL HAD HIS CIRCASSIAN COAT ON AND CARRIED A GUN AND SWORD THE CORPORAL
2407-7664-0011 A TALL THIN COSSACK WITH AN EXCEPTIONALLY LONG BACK AND SMALL HANDS AND FEET WAS SITTING ON THE EARTH BANK OF A HUT WITH HIS BESHMET UNBUTTONED ON HIS FACE WAS THE LAZY BORED EXPRESSION OF A SUPERIOR
2407-7664-0012 HE DROPPED HIS HEAD UPON THE PALM FIRST OF ONE HAND AND THEN OF THE OTHER AN ELDERLY COSSACK WITH A BROAD GREYISH BLACK BEARD WAS LYING IN HIS SHIRT GIRDLED WITH A BLACK STRAP CLOSE TO THE RIVER
2407-7664-0013 AS THEY MONOTONOUSLY FOAMED AND SWIRLED OTHERS ALSO OVERCOME BY THE HEAT AND HALF NAKED WERE RINSING CLOTHES IN THE TEREK PLAITING A FISHING LINE OR HUMMING TUNES AS THEY LAY ON THE HOT SAND OF THE RIVER BANK
2407-7664-0014 ONE COSSACK WITH A THIN FACE MUCH BURNT BY THE SUN LAY NEAR THE HUT EVIDENTLY DEAD DRUNK BY A WALL WHICH THOUGH IT HAD BEEN IN SHADOW SOME TWO HOURS PREVIOUSLY WAS NOW EXPOSED TO THE SUN'S FIERCE SLANTING RAYS
2407-7664-0015 LUKASHKA WHO STOOD ON THE WATCH TOWER WAS A TALL HANDSOME LAD ABOUT TWENTY YEARS OLD AND VERY LIKE HIS MOTHER HIS FACE AND WHOLE BUILD IN SPITE OF THE ANGULARITY OF YOUTH INDICATED GREAT STRENGTH
2407-7664-0016 BOTH PHYSICAL AND MORAL THOUGH HE HAD ONLY LATELY JOINED THE COSSACKS AT THE FRONT IT WAS EVIDENT FROM THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE AND THE CALM ASSURANCE OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE HAD ALREADY ACQUIRED THE SOMEWHAT PROUD AND WARLIKE BEARING PECULIAR TO COSSACKS
2407-7664-0017 AND TO MEN GENERALLY WHO CONTINUALLY CARRY ARMS AND THAT HE FELT HE WAS A COSSACK AND FULLY KNEW HIS OWN VALUE HIS AMPLE CIRCASSIAN COAT WAS TORN IN SOME PLACES HIS CAP WAS ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD CHECHEN FASHION AND HIS LEGGINGS HAD SLIPPED BELOW HIS KNEES
2407-7664-0018 HIS CLOTHING WAS NOT RICH BUT HE WORE IT WITH THAT PECULIAR COSSACK FOPPISHNESS WHICH CONSISTS IN IMITATING THE CHECHEN BRAVE EVERYTHING ON A REAL BRAVE IS AMPLE RAGGED AND NEGLECTED ONLY HIS WEAPONS ARE COSTLY
2407-7664-0019 BUT THESE RAGGED CLOTHES AND THESE WEAPONS ARE BELTED AND WORN WITH A CERTAIN AIR AND MATCHED IN A CERTAIN MANNER NEITHER OF WHICH CAN BE ACQUIRED BY EVERYBODY AND WHICH AT ONCE STRIKE THE EYE OF A COSSACK OR A HILLSMAN LUKASHKA HAD THIS RESEMBLANCE TO A BRAVE
2407-7664-0020 HE KEPT LOOKING AT THE DISTANT TARTAR VILLAGE TAKEN SEPARATELY HIS FEATURES WERE NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT ANYONE WHO SAW HIS STATELY CARRIAGE AND HIS DARK BROWED INTELLIGENT FACE WOULD INVOLUNTARILY SAY WHAT A FINE FELLOW LOOK AT THE WOMEN
