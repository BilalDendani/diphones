834-130870-0000 THIS CELL PROPERLY SPEAKING WAS THE NAUTILUS'S ARSENAL AND WARDROBE HANGING FROM ITS WALLS A DOZEN DIVING OUTFITS WERE WAITING FOR ANYBODY WHO WANTED TO TAKE A STROLL
834-130870-0001 AFTER SEEING THESE NED LAND EXHIBITED AN OBVIOUS DISTASTE FOR THE IDEA OF PUTTING ONE ON BUT MY GALLANT NED I TOLD HIM THE FORESTS OF CRESPO ISLAND ARE SIMPLY UNDERWATER FORESTS
834-130870-0002 OH GREAT PUT IN THE DISAPPOINTED HARPOONER WATCHING HIS DREAMS OF FRESH MEAT FADE AWAY AND YOU PROFESSOR ARONNAX ARE YOU GOING TO STICK YOURSELF INSIDE THESE CLOTHES IT HAS TO BE MISTER NED
834-130870-0003 HAVE IT YOUR WAY SIR THE HARPOONER REPLIED SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS BUT SPEAKING FOR MYSELF I'LL NEVER GET INTO THOSE THINGS UNLESS THEY FORCE ME NO ONE WILL FORCE YOU MISTER LAND CAPTAIN NEMO SAID
834-130870-0004 AND IS CONSEIL GOING TO RISK IT NED ASKED WHERE MASTER GOES I GO CONSEIL REPLIED AT THE CAPTAIN'S SUMMONS TWO CREWMEN CAME TO HELP US PUT ON THESE HEAVY WATERPROOF CLOTHES
834-130870-0005 MADE FROM SEAMLESS INDIA RUBBER AND EXPRESSLY DESIGNED TO BEAR CONSIDERABLE PRESSURES THEY WERE LIKE SUITS OF ARMOR THAT WERE BOTH YIELDING AND RESISTANT YOU MIGHT SAY THESE CLOTHES CONSISTED OF JACKET AND PANTS
834-130870-0006 THE FABRIC OF THE JACKET WAS REINFORCED WITH COPPER MAIL THAT SHIELDED THE CHEST PROTECTED IT FROM THE WATER'S PRESSURE AND ALLOWED THE LUNGS TO FUNCTION FREELY THE SLEEVES ENDED IN SUPPLE GLOVES THAT DIDN'T IMPEDE HAND MOVEMENTS
834-130870-0007 THESE PERFECTED DIVING SUITS IT WAS EASY TO SEE WERE A FAR CRY FROM SUCH MISSHAPEN COSTUMES AS THE CORK BREASTPLATES LEATHER JUMPERS SEAGOING TUNICS
834-130870-0008 INVENTED AND ACCLAIMED IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CONSEIL AND I WERE SOON DRESSED IN THESE DIVING SUITS
834-130870-0009 ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO ENCASE ONE'S HEAD IN ITS METAL SPHERE BUT BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH THIS OPERATION I ASKED THE CAPTAIN FOR PERMISSION TO EXAMINE THE RIFLES SET ASIDE FOR US
834-130870-0010 ONE OF THE NAUTILUS'S MEN PRESENTED ME WITH A STREAMLINED RIFLE WHOSE BUTT WAS BOILERPLATE STEEL HOLLOW INSIDE AND OF FAIRLY LARGE DIMENSIONS THIS SERVED AS A TANK FOR THE COMPRESSED AIR
834-130870-0011 WHICH A TRIGGER OPERATED VALVE COULD RELEASE INTO THE METAL CHAMBER IN A GROOVE WHERE THE BUTT WAS HEAVIEST A CARTRIDGE CLIP HELD SOME TWENTY ELECTRIC BULLETS THAT BY MEANS OF A SPRING
834-130870-0012 AUTOMATICALLY TOOK THEIR PLACES IN THE BARREL OF THE RIFLE AS SOON AS ONE SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED ANOTHER WAS READY TO GO OFF CAPTAIN NEMO I SAID THIS IS AN IDEAL EASY TO USE WEAPON I ASK ONLY TO PUT IT TO THE TEST
834-130870-0013 CONSEIL AND I DID THE SAME BUT NOT WITHOUT HEARING THE CANADIAN TOSS US A SARCASTIC HAPPY HUNTING ON TOP THE SUIT ENDED IN A COLLAR OF THREADED COPPER ONTO WHICH THE METAL HELMET WAS SCREWED
834-130870-0014 THREE HOLES PROTECTED BY HEAVY GLASS ALLOWED US TO SEE IN ANY DIRECTION WITH SIMPLY A TURN OF THE HEAD INSIDE THE SPHERE PLACED ON OUR BACKS THE ROUQUAYROL DEVICE WENT INTO OPERATION AS SOON AS IT WAS IN POSITION
834-130870-0015 AND FOR MY PART I COULD BREATHE WITH EASE THE RUHMKORFF LAMP HANGING FROM MY BELT MY RIFLE IN HAND I WAS READY TO GO FORTH BUT IN ALL HONESTY WHILE IMPRISONED IN THESE HEAVY CLOTHES
834-130870-0016 AND NAILED TO THE DECK BY MY LEAD SOLES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TAKE A SINGLE STEP BUT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE HAD BEEN FORESEEN BECAUSE I FELT MYSELF PROPELLED INTO A LITTLE ROOM ADJOINING THE WARDROBE
834-130870-0017 TOWED IN THE SAME WAY MY COMPANIONS WENT WITH ME I HEARD A DOOR WITH WATERTIGHT SEALS CLOSE AFTER US AND WE WERE SURROUNDED BY PROFOUND DARKNESS AFTER SOME MINUTES A SHARP HISSING REACHED MY EARS
834-130870-0018 I FELT A DISTINCT SENSATION OF COLD RISING FROM MY FEET TO MY CHEST APPARENTLY A STOPCOCK INSIDE THE BOAT WAS LETTING IN WATER FROM OUTSIDE WHICH OVERRAN US AND SOON FILLED UP THE ROOM
834-130870-0019 CONTRIVED IN THE NAUTILUS'S SIDE A SECOND DOOR THEN OPENED
834-130870-0020 WORDS ARE POWERLESS TO DESCRIBE SUCH WONDERS WHEN EVEN THE PAINTER'S BRUSH CAN'T DEPICT THE EFFECTS UNIQUE TO THE LIQUID ELEMENT HOW CAN THE WRITER'S PEN HOPE TO REPRODUCE THEM
834-130870-0021 ALL THESE OBJECTS LOST A PART OF THEIR WEIGHT EQUAL TO THE WEIGHT OF THE LIQUID THEY DISPLACED AND THANKS TO THIS LAW OF PHYSICS DISCOVERED BY ARCHIMEDES I DID JUST FINE
834-130870-0022 I WAS NO LONGER AN INERT MASS AND I HAD COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING GREAT FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
834-130870-0023 THE SUN ASTONISHED ME WITH ITS POWER THE SOLAR RAYS EASILY CROSSED THIS AQUEOUS MASS AND DISPERSED ITS DARK COLORS I COULD EASILY DISTINGUISH OBJECTS ONE HUNDRED METERS AWAY FARTHER ON
834-130870-0024 THE BOTTOM WAS TINTED WITH FINE SHADES OF ULTRAMARINE THEN OFF IN THE DISTANCE IT TURNED BLUE AND FADED IN THE MIDST OF A HAZY DARKNESS TRULY THIS WATER SURROUNDING ME
834-130870-0025 WAS JUST A KIND OF AIR DENSER THAN THE ATMOSPHERE ON LAND BUT ALMOST AS TRANSPARENT ABOVE ME I COULD SEE THE CALM SURFACE OF THE OCEAN WE WERE WALKING ON SAND THAT WAS FINE GRAINED AND SMOOTH
834-130870-0026 NOT WRINKLED LIKE BEACH SAND WHICH PRESERVES THE IMPRESSIONS LEFT BY THE WAVES THIS DAZZLING CARPET WAS A REAL MIRROR THROWING BACK THE SUN'S RAYS WITH STARTLING INTENSITY THE OUTCOME
834-130870-0027 AN IMMENSE VISTA OF REFLECTIONS THAT PENETRATED EVERY LIQUID MOLECULE WILL ANYONE BELIEVE ME IF I ASSERT THAT AT THIS THIRTY FOOT DEPTH I COULD SEE AS IF IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT
834-130870-0028 BUT WHEN NIGHT FELL IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS THE SHIP'S BEACON WOULD SURELY FACILITATE OUR RETURN ON BOARD SINCE ITS RAYS CARRIED WITH PERFECT DISTINCTNESS
834-130870-0029 MY HANDS PARTED LIQUID CURTAINS THAT CLOSED AGAIN BEHIND ME AND MY FOOTPRINTS FADED SWIFTLY UNDER THE WATER'S PRESSURE SOON SCARCELY BLURRED BY THEIR DISTANCE FROM US
834-130870-0030 THE FORMS OF SOME OBJECTS TOOK SHAPE BEFORE MY EYES I RECOGNIZED THE LOWER SLOPES OF SOME MAGNIFICENT ROCKS CARPETED BY THE FINEST ZOOPHYTE SPECIMENS AND RIGHT OFF
834-130870-0031 I WAS STRUCK BY AN EFFECT UNIQUE TO THIS MEDIUM BY THEN IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE SUN'S RAYS HIT THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES AT A FAIRLY OBLIQUE ANGLE DECOMPOSING BY REFRACTION AS THOUGH PASSING THROUGH A PRISM
834-130870-0032 AND WHEN THIS LIGHT CAME IN CONTACT WITH FLOWERS ROCKS BUDS SEASHELLS AND POLYPS THE EDGES OF THESE OBJECTS WERE SHADED WITH ALL SEVEN HUES OF THE SOLAR SPECTRUM
834-130870-0033 THIS RIOT OF RAINBOW TINTS WAS A WONDER A FEAST FOR THE EYES A GENUINE KALEIDOSCOPE OF RED GREEN YELLOW ORANGE VIOLET INDIGO AND BLUE IN SHORT
834-130870-0034 THE WHOLE PALETTE OF A COLOR HAPPY PAINTER IF ONLY I HAD BEEN ABLE TO SHARE WITH CONSEIL THE INTENSE SENSATIONS RISING IN MY BRAIN COMPETING WITH HIM IN EXCLAMATIONS OF WONDERMENT IF ONLY I HAD KNOWN
834-130870-0035 HOW TO EXCHANGE THOUGHTS BY MEANS OF PREARRANGED SIGNALS SO FOR LACK OF ANYTHING BETTER I TALKED TO MYSELF I DECLAIMED INSIDE THIS COPPER BOX THAT TOPPED MY HEAD
834-130870-0036 SPENDING MORE AIR ON EMPTY WORDS THAN WAS PERHAPS ADVISABLE CONSEIL LIKE ME HAD STOPPED BEFORE THIS SPLENDID SIGHT
834-130870-0037 OBVIOUSLY IN THE PRESENCE OF THESE ZOOPHYTE AND MOLLUSK SPECIMENS THE FINE LAD WAS CLASSIFYING HIS HEAD OFF
834-130870-0038 VARIOUS ISIS CORAL CORNULARIAN CORAL LIVING IN ISOLATION TUFTS OF VIRGINAL GENUS OCULINA FORMERLY KNOWN BY THE NAME WHITE CORAL PRICKLY FUNGUS CORAL IN THE SHAPE OF MUSHROOMS
834-130870-0039 SEA ANEMONE HOLDING ON BY THEIR MUSCULAR DISKS PROVIDING A LITERAL FLOWERBED ADORNED BY JELLYFISH FROM THE GENUS PORPITA
834-130870-0040 AND STARFISH THAT SPANGLED THE SAND INCLUDING VEINLIKE FEATHER STARS FROM THE GENUS ASTEROPHYTON THAT WERE LIKE FINE LACE EMBROIDERED BY THE HANDS OF WATER NYMPHS
834-130870-0041 THEIR FESTOONS SWAYING TO THE FAINT UNDULATIONS CAUSED BY OUR WALKING IT FILLED ME WITH REAL CHAGRIN TO CRUSH UNDERFOOT THE GLEAMING MOLLUSK SAMPLES THAT LITTERED THE SEAFLOOR BY THE THOUSANDS
834-130870-0042 CONCENTRIC COMB SHELLS HAMMER SHELLS
834-130870-0043 SEASHELLS THAT ACTUALLY HOP AROUND TOP SHELL SNAILS RED HELMET SHELLS ANGEL WING CONCHS SEA HARES AND SO MANY OTHER EXHIBITS FROM THIS INEXHAUSTIBLE OCEAN
834-130870-0044 AND WE WENT FORWARD WHILE OVERHEAD THERE SCUDDED SCHOOLS OF PORTUGUESE MEN OF WAR THAT LET THEIR ULTRAMARINE TENTACLES DRIFT IN THEIR WAKES MEDUSAS WHOSE MILKY WHITE OR DAINTY PINK PARASOLS
834-130870-0045 AND SHADED US FROM THE SUN'S RAYS
834-130870-0046 ALL THESE WONDERS I GLIMPSED IN THE SPACE OF A QUARTER OF A MILE
834-130870-0047 THEN WE CROSSED A PRAIRIE OF ALGAE OPEN SEA PLANTS THAT THE WATERS HADN'T YET TORN LOOSE WHOSE VEGETATION GREW IN WILD PROFUSION SOFT TO THE FOOT
834-130870-0048 THESE DENSELY TEXTURED LAWNS WOULD HAVE RIVALED THE MOST LUXURIANT CARPETS WOVEN BY THE HAND OF MAN BUT WHILE THIS GREENERY WAS SPRAWLING UNDER OUR STEPS IT DIDN'T NEGLECT US OVERHEAD
834-130870-0049 THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WAS CRISSCROSSED BY A FLOATING ARBOR OF MARINE PLANTS BELONGING TO THAT SUPERABUNDANT ALGAE FAMILY THAT NUMBERS MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND KNOWN SPECIES I SAW LONG RIBBONS OF FUCUS
834-130870-0050 THESE ALGAE ARE A GENUINE PRODIGY OF CREATION ONE OF THE WONDERS OF WORLD FLORA THIS FAMILY PRODUCES BOTH THE BIGGEST AND SMALLEST VEGETABLES IN THE WORLD
834-130870-0051 BECAUSE JUST AS FORTY THOUSAND NEAR INVISIBLE BUDS HAVE BEEN COUNTED IN ONE FIVE SQUARE MILLIMETER SPACE SO ALSO HAVE FUCUS PLANTS BEEN GATHERED THAT WERE OVER FIVE HUNDRED METERS LONG
834-130870-0052 WE HAD BEEN GONE FROM THE NAUTILUS FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF IT WAS ALMOST NOON I SPOTTED THIS FACT IN THE PERPENDICULARITY OF THE SUN'S RAYS WHICH WERE NO LONGER REFRACTED
834-130870-0053 BY WHICH POINT WE WERE UNDERGOING A PRESSURE OF TEN ATMOSPHERES BUT MY DIVING CLOTHES WERE BUILT ALONG SUCH LINES THAT I NEVER SUFFERED FROM THIS PRESSURE I FELT ONLY A CERTAIN TIGHTNESS IN THE JOINTS OF MY FINGERS
834-130870-0054 AND EVEN THIS DISCOMFORT SOON DISAPPEARED AS FOR THE EXHAUSTION BOUND TO ACCOMPANY A TWO HOUR STROLL IN SUCH UNFAMILIAR TRAPPINGS IT WAS NIL HELPED BY THE WATER
834-130870-0055 MY MOVEMENTS WERE EXECUTED WITH STARTLING EASE ARRIVING AT THIS THREE HUNDRED FOOT DEPTH I STILL DETECTED THE SUN'S RAYS BUT JUST BARELY
834-130870-0056 A MIDPOINT BETWEEN DAY AND NIGHT BUT WE COULD SEE WELL ENOUGH TO FIND OUR WAY AND IT STILL WASN'T NECESSARY TO ACTIVATE THE RUHMKORFF DEVICE
