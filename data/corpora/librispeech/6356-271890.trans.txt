6356-271890-0000 EIGHT MONTHS PASSED DURING WHICH THE STRANGE INCIDENT GRADUALLY FADED FROM MY MIND THE INCREASED NUMBER OF PERSONS WHO WERE BEING SENT FROM ALL PARTS OF RUSSIA TO SIBERIA WITHOUT TRIAL
6356-271890-0001 HAD BECOME A SUBJECT OF MUCH COMMENT IN ENGLAND
6356-271890-0002 AND THE SHOCKING BRUTALITY AND INHUMAN TREATMENT TO WHICH THE OFT TIMES INNOCENT CONVICTS WERE SUBJECTED WERE CONTINUALLY REACHING LONDON FROM VARIOUS SOURCES AND PUBLIC FEELING AGAINST RUSSIAN AUTOCRACY
6356-271890-0003 HAD RISEN TO FEVER HEAT HENCE IT WAS THAT ONE DAY WHEN I ENTERED MY OFFICE I RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS TO PROCEED WITHOUT DELAY TO SIBERIA IN ORDER TO INSPECT THE GENERAL CONDITION OF THE PRISONERS AND ASCERTAIN THE TRUTH
6356-271890-0004 OF THE HARROWING DETAILS THE PROSPECT OF THIS MISSION DELIGHTED ME FOR NOT ONLY WAS IT CERTAIN TO BE FRAUGHT WITH A GOOD DEAL OF EXCITING ADVENTURE BUT IT WOULD ALSO ENABLE ME TO COMPLETE THE NOVEL ALREADY HALF WRITTEN
6356-271890-0005 AND WHICH I HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO PUT ASIDE OWING TO LACK OF INFORMATION REGARDING LIFE IN THE ASIATIC PENAL SETTLEMENTS THAT EVENING AFTER CALLING UPON GRIGOROVITCH AND INFORMING HIM OF MY PROJECTED JOURNEY I RETURNED HOME
6356-271890-0006 AND SAT AT MY WRITING TABLE FAR INTO THE NIGHT FINISHING SOME WORK UPON WHICH I HAD BEEN ENGAGED THE WHOLE OF THE FOLLOWING DAY I SPENT IN PACKING MY TRAPS AND OTHERWISE PREPARING FOR A LONG ABSENCE IN THE EVENING
6356-271890-0007 WHILE I WAS BUSY WRITING SOME LETTERS THE SERVANT ANNOUNCED THAT A YOUNG LADY WHO REFUSED HER NAME DESIRED TO SEE ME I WAS NOT PARTICULARLY CLEAN AND I CONFESS
6356-271890-0008 THAT JUST THEN I WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY DEPARTURE TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE HOWEVER MY CURIOSITY GOT THE BETTER OF ME AND I TOLD HER TO ADMIT THE STRANGER YOU I CRIED
6356-271890-0009 WE WERE COMPELLED TO LEAVE HURRIEDLY AND AS THE SECRET POLICE WERE WATCHING BOTH YOU AND ME IT WAS UNSAFE FOR US TO MEET TO NIGHT I HAVE RISKED COMING TO YOU FOR A MOST IMPORTANT PURPOSE
6356-271890-0010 SHE ADDED LOOKING UP INTO MY FACE EARNESTLY OH WHAT'S THAT I ASKED I WANT YOU TO TAKE ME TO SIBERIA TO SIBERIA YOU I REPEATED IN ASTONISHMENT YES I HEAR YOU ARE GOING
6356-271890-0011 ANY NEWS AFFECTING US TRAVELS RAPIDLY I I HAVE AN INTENSE DESIRE TO SEE WHAT THE COUNTRY BEYOND THE URALS IS LIKE WHO TOLD YOU I WAS GOING I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY SHE REPLIED ALL I ASK
6356-271890-0012 IS THAT I MAY BE ALLOWED TO ACCOMPANY YOU I HAVE HERE SUFFICIENT MONEY TO DEFRAY THE COST OF MY JOURNEY AND SHE DREW FROM THE BREAST OF HER DRESS A LARGE PACKET OF RUSSIAN BANK NOTES I SHOOK MY HEAD REPLYING
6356-271890-0013 THAT SIBERIA WAS NO PLACE FOR A DELICATELY REARED WOMAN AND POINTED OUT THE UNINVITING PROSPECT OF A WINTER JOURNEY OF FIVE THOUSAND MILES IN A SLEIGH BESIDES I ADDED
6356-271890-0014 YOUR CONNECTION WITH THE TERRORISTS WOULD RENDER IT UNSAFE FOR YOU TO RETURN TO RUSSIA
6356-271890-0015 SHE ASKED EARNESTLY AFTER A FEW MOMENTS SILENCE SCARCELY OF COURSE I SHOULD NOT TRAVEL IN THIS DRESS BUT WOULD ASSUME THE DISGUISE OF A RUSSIAN LAD IN ORDER TO ACT AS YOUR SERVANT AND INTERPRETER
6356-271890-0016 AS FOR LES CONVENANCES AND SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS SHE PULLED A LITTLE GRIMACE AND ADDED BAH WE ARE NOT LOVERS I ASKED FOR NEWS OF HER FATHER BUT SHE INFORMED ME THAT HE WAS IN ZURICH
6356-271890-0017 SHE REFUSED TO GIVE ME HER ADDRESS AND ALL ARGUMENT WAS USELESS THE POINT SHE URGED THAT SHE WOULD BE COMPANION AND INTERPRETER COMBINED IMPRESSED ME AND ERE
6356-271890-0018 I HAD FINALLY PROMISED SHE HAD GIVEN ME INSTRUCTIONS THAT I SHOULD IN APPLYING FOR MY PASSPORT FROM THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY ALSO
6356-271890-0019 FOUR EVENINGS LATER I WAS ON THE PLATFORM AT CHARING CROSS STATION
6356-271890-0020 AND CHATTING TO TWO OLD FLEET STREET FRIENDS WHO HAD COME TO SEE THE LAST OF ME WHEN A RATHER SHORT YOUNG MAN ENVELOPED IN A LONG HEAVY ULSTER APPROACHED AND TOUCHING HIS CAP RESPECTFULLY SAID GOOD EVENING SIR
6356-271890-0021 I HOPE I'M NOT LATE NO PLENTY OF TIME I SAID INDIFFERENTLY ALTHOUGH I HAD A DIFFICULT TASK TO KEEP MY COUNTENANCE TURNING TO MY FRIENDS I EXPLAINED THAT'S MY INTERPRETER IVANOVITCH MEANWHILE
6356-271890-0022 AS I FOR THE FIRST TIME REGARDED HER CRITICALLY HER DISGUISE WAS SO COMPLETE THAT FOR THE MOMENT WHEN SHE HAD GREETED ME I HAD BEEN DECEIVED LAUGHING AT HER SUCCESSFUL MAKE UP SHE REMOVED HER ROUND FUR CAP
6356-271890-0023 BY CUTTING HER HAIR SHORTER TO MAKE IT APPEAR LIKE A MAN'S UNDERNEATH HER OVERCOAT SHE WORE A SUIT OF THICK ROUGH TWEED AND WITH GREAT GUSTO SHE RELATED HOW SHE HAD FILLED UP HER LARGE BOOTS WITH WOOL SHE PRODUCED
6356-271890-0024 THE INEVITABLE CIGARETTES AND WE SPENT THE TWO HOURS BETWEEN LONDON AND QUEENBOROUGH IN SMOKING AND CHATTING TO DESCRIBE IN DETAIL OUR LONG RAILWAY JOURNEY ACROSS EUROPE BY WAY OF BERLIN AND MOSCOW
6356-271890-0025 WOULD OCCUPY TOO MUCH SPACE SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT I TRAVELLED THROUGH HOLY RUSSIA WITH A PASSPORT WHICH BORE THE VISE OF THE MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR AT PETERSBURG AND WHICH ENSURED
6356-271890-0026 MYSELF AND MY SERVANT CIVILITY AND ATTENTION ON THE PART OF POLICE OFFICIALS AT LENGTH WE PASSED THROUGH THE URALS AND ALIGHTED
6356-271890-0027 AND SHEEPSKIN BOOTS WE HAD BOUGHT TOOK OUR SEATS THE BAGGAGE AND PROVISIONS HAVING BEEN PACKED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CONVEYANCE
6356-271890-0028 SOON WE WERE OUT UPON THE GREAT POST ROAD AND AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE THERE WAS NO OTHER OBJECT VISIBLE ON THE BROAD SNOW COVERED PLAIN BUT THE LONG STRAIGHT LINE OF BLACK TELEGRAPH POLES AND STRIPED VERST POSTS
6356-271890-0029 THAT MARKED OUR ROUTE DAY AFTER DAY WE CONTINUED OUR JOURNEY OFTEN PASSING THROUGH MILES OF GLOOMY PINE FORESTS AND THEN OUT AGAIN UPON THE GREAT BARREN STEPPES FREQUENTLY WE MET CONVOYS OF CONVICTS
6356-271890-0030 PITIFUL DESPAIRING BANDS OF MEN AND WOMEN DRAGGING THEIR CLANKING CHAINS WITH THEM WEARILY AND TRUDGING ONWARD TOWARDS A LIFE TO WHICH DEATH WOULD BE PREFERABLE
6356-271890-0031 NO MERCY WAS SHOWN THEM BY THEIR MOUNTED ESCORTS FOR IF A PRISONER STUMBLED AND FELL FROM SHEER EXHAUSTION HE WAS BEATEN BACK TO HIS SENSES
6356-271890-0032 WITH THE TERRIBLE KNOUT WHICH EACH COSSACK CARRIED ON DARK NIGHTS WE HALTED AT POST HOUSES BUT WHEN THE MOON SHONE WE CONTINUED OUR DRIVE SNATCHING SLEEP AS BEST WE COULD
6356-271890-0033 WE LIVED UPON OUR TINNED MEATS AND BISCUITS THE POST HOUSES WHICH ARE USUALLY ABOUT TWENTY TO THIRTY MILES APART SUPPLYING TEA AND OTHER NECESSARIES ALTHOUGH THE JOURNEY WAS TERRIBLY MONOTONOUS AND UNCOMFORTABLE WITH A BITING WIND
6356-271890-0034 AND THE INTENSE WHITE OF THE SNOW AFFECTING ONE'S EYES PAINFULLY MY FAIR FELLOW TRAVELLER UTTERED NO WORD OF COMPLAINT ALL DAY SHE WOULD SIT BESIDE ME CHATTING IN ENGLISH LAUGHING SMOKING CIGARETTES AND NOW AND THEN
6356-271890-0035 CARRYING ON A CONVERSATION IN RUSSIAN WITH OUR BLACK BEARDED FIERCE LOOKING DRIVER AFTERWARDS INTERPRETING HIS OBSERVATIONS INDEED
6356-271890-0036 THE MORE LIGHT HEARTED SHE BECAME ARRIVING AT LAST AT TOMSK WE REMAINED THERE THREE WEEKS DURING WHICH TIME I VISITED THE KAMERAS OF THE FORWARDING PRISON
6356-271890-0037 ISPRAVNIKS OR POLICE OFFICERS DURING THE REPEATED EXAMINATION OF OUR BAGGAGE AT ALMOST EVERY SMALL TOWN WE PASSED THROUGH SINCE LEAVING ENGLAND TIME HAD SLIPPED RAPIDLY AWAY UNTIL ONE DAY AFTER WE HAD LEFT TOMSK
6356-271890-0038 AND WERE WELL ON OUR WAY TOWARDS YENISEISK I CHANCED TO TAKE OUT MY DIARY I DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS THE LAST DAY OF THE OLD YEAR THE JOURNEY HAD BEEN MOST CHEERLESS AND WEARISOME IT WAS NOW ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
6356-271890-0039 AND THE SUN WHICH HAD STRUGGLED OUT FOR HALF AN HOUR
6356-271890-0040 YOU MUST BE TERRIBLY TIRED I SAID RECOLLECTING THAT IT WAS TWO DAYS SINCE WE DROVE OUT OF TOMSK AND THAT OWING TO THE LACK OF ACCOMMODATION AT THE POST HOUSES WE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO REST NO I'M NOT VERY TIRED SHE REPLIED
6356-271890-0041 BUT I FEEL SO CRAMPED AND COLD NEVER MIND I SAID CHEERFULLY PLACING MY ARM TENDERLY
6356-271890-0042 AROUND HER WAIST AND DRAWING HER CLOSER TO ME IN A COUPLE OF HOURS WE SHALL GET SOMETHING HOT TO EAT SHE DID NOT ANSWER BUT IN A FEW MOMENTS SHE AGAIN FELL ASLEEP WITH HER HEAD UPON MY SHOULDER AND I TOO ALSO DOZED OFF
6356-271890-0043 OUR LONELY HALTING PLACE WAS LIKE ALL SIBERIAN POST HOUSES BUILT OF PINE LOGS AND LITTLE BETTER THAN A LARGE HUT DEVOID OF ANY VESTIGE OF COMFORT AND HORRIBLY DIRTY
6356-271890-0044 THE SITTING ROOM WAS A BARE UNCARPETED PLACE WITH A LARGE BRICK STOVE IN THE CENTRE A PICTURE OF THE VIRGIN UPON THE WALL A WOODEN TABLE AND THREE OR FOUR ROUGH CHAIRS WHILE THE LITTLE DENS
6356-271890-0045 THAT SERVED AS SLEEPING APARTMENTS CONTAINED NOTHING BEYOND A CHAIR AND A STRAW MATTRESS IT WAS NOT LONG AFTER OUR ARRIVAL THAT THE GREAT SAMOVAR WAS PLACED UPON THE TABLE AND TOGETHER WITH THE TWO SINISTER LOOKING FELLOWS WHO KEPT THE PLACE
6356-271890-0046 WE SAT DOWN TO A ROUGH UNCIVILISED MEAL THE EVENING WE SPENT IN SMOKING AND DRINKING VODKA PRASCOVIE AND I BEING ABLE TO CARRY ON A PRIVATE CONVERSATION BY SPEAKING ENGLISH I ASKED WHY SHE WAS SO UNUSUALLY THOUGHTFUL
6356-271890-0047 BUT SHE REPLIED THAT IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE SHE WAS IN NEED OF REST I AM SORRY I AM BREAKING DOWN SHE SAID APOLOGETICALLY AND LAUGHING AT THE SAME TIME BUT I'M ONLY A WOMAN IT WAS INDEED VERY KIND OF YOU TO HAVE BEEN BOTHERED WITH ME
6356-271890-0048 DON'T MENTION IT I SAID I'M SURE I'M INDEBTED TO YOU FOR YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF RUSSIAN ASSISTS ME IN MY WORK DO YOU REMEMBER I ADDED THAT IT IS A YEAR TO NIGHT SINCE WE FIRST MET WAS IT
6356-271890-0049 SHE ASKED IN A STRANGE TONE OF ALARM AH I REMEMBER I I WAS HAPPY THEN WASN'T I ARE YOU NOT HAPPY NOW I INQUIRED YES VERY SHE REPLIED SMILING BUT I'M TIRED AND MUST GO TO MY ROOM
6356-271890-0050 OR I SHALL BE FIT FOR NOTHING TO MORROW VERY WELL I REPLIED I'LL TELL YOU TO GO IN A FEW MINUTES THEN AFTER JOINING THE DRIVER AND POST HOUSE KEEPERS
6356-271890-0051 I SHALL REQUIRE YOU NO LONGER GATHERING UP HER COAT HAT AND GLOVES SHE BOWED
6356-271890-0052 AFTER SMOKING FOR ANOTHER HOUR I ALSO SOUGHT MY DIRTY LITTLE DEN IN THE HEART OF SIBERIA ONE MUST EXPECT TO ROUGH IT THEREFORE I TOOK MY REVOLVER FROM MY BELT PLACED IT UNDER MY PILLOW
6356-271890-0053 STRAPPED MY FUR RUG AROUND MY NECK AND STRETCHING MYSELF UPON THE HARD PALLET SOON DROPPED OFF TO SLEEP NEXT MORNING WHEN I HAD DRESSED I KNOCKED SEVERAL TIMES AT PRASCOVIE'S DOOR BUT RECEIVED NO REPLY SUBSEQUENTLY I PUSHED IT OPEN AND ENTERED
6356-271890-0054 DISCOVERING TO MY SURPRISE THAT THE ROOM WAS EMPTY NOTWITHSTANDING MY LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF RUSSIAN I MANAGED TO MAKE THE MEN UNDERSTAND THAT MY SERVANT WAS MISSING AND THEY SEARCHED THE PREMISES BUT WITHOUT AVAIL THEY EXAMINED THE ROAD OUTSIDE
6356-271890-0055 BUT AS IT HAD BEEN SNOWING HEAVILY DURING THE NIGHT NO FOOTPRINTS WERE VISIBLE
6356-271890-0056 WHILE I REMAINED IN CHARGE OF THE POST HOUSE THE THREE MEN MOUNTED THE HORSES AND RODE OUT IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THINKING IT POSSIBLE
6356-271890-0057 TOWARDS EVENING HOWEVER THEY RETURNED AFTER A LONG AND FUTILE SEARCH ANXIOUS TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY AND RELUCTANT TO LEAVE WITHOUT HER I REMAINED THERE SEVERAL DAYS AS THE NEAREST DWELLING WAS TWENTY MILES DISTANT AND HER OVERCOAT AND HAT STILL REMAINED IN HER ROOM
6356-271890-0058 HER DISAPPEARANCE WAS ALL THE MORE PUZZLING I EXAMINED HER BOX BUT FOUND NOTHING IN IT EXCEPT ARTICLES OF MALE WEARING APPAREL
6356-271890-0059 WITH HEAVY HEART AND SORELY PUZZLED OVER THE MYSTERY I CONTINUED MY LONELY JOURNEY TOWARDS THE MINES OF YENISEISK HAVING INSPECTED THEM I JOURNEYED SOUTH ALONE AND DEJECTED AND INVESTIGATED
6356-271890-0060 OF PRASCOVIE SOUVAROFF WHO OWES TO YOU THE SAFE RETURN OF HIS BELOVED WIFE SENDS THIS LITTLE GIFT AS A SLIGHT RECOGNITION OF THE KINDNESS SHE RECEIVED AT YOUR HANDS THERE WAS NEITHER NAME ADDRESS NOR DATE NOTHING TO SHOW WHO WAS THE ANONYMOUS HUSBAND THE MYSTERY WAS SOLVED IN A MOST UNEXPECTED MANNER
6356-271890-0061 SOME MONTHS AFTER THE RESULTS OF MY INVESTIGATIONS HAD BEEN PUBLISHED I CHANCED ONE NIGHT TO ATTEND THE BANQUET OF THE ASSOCIATION OF FOREIGN CONSULS HELD IN THE WHITEHALL ROOMS OF THE HOTEL METROPOLE
6356-271890-0062 AS USUAL A NUMBER OF THE CORPS DIPLOMATIQUE WERE PRESENT AND AMONG THEM
6356-271890-0063 ONE OF THE ATTACHES OF THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE WHOM I HAD NOT SEEN SINCE MY RETURN I CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR LUCKY ESCAPE OLD FELLOW HE EXCLAIMED AFTER WE HAD EXCHANGED CORDIAL GREETINGS ESCAPE
6356-271890-0064 FOR I IMAGINED NO ONE WAS AWARE THAT SHE HAD BEEN MY COMPANION
6356-271890-0065 BY JOVE IT WAS QUITE A ROMANCE TRAVELLING ALL THAT DISTANCE WITH A PRETTY COMPANION AND THEN LOSING HER ON THE YENISEISK STEPPE IT WAS LUCKY FOR YOU HOWEVER THAT SHE LEFT YOU IN TIME OTHERWISE YOU WOULD IN ALL PROBABILITY
6356-271890-0066 OR SOME OTHER PLACE EQUALLY DELIGHTFUL BY THIS TIME EXPLAIN YOURSELF I URGED IMPATIENTLY YOU'RE TALKING IN ENIGMAS
6356-271890-0067 THE MAN YOU KNEW AS SOUVAROFF
6356-271890-0068 WEALTHY AND POPULAR AT OUR COURT AT PETERSBURG BUT HE WAS SUSPECTED OF POLITICAL INTRIGUE AND SENTENCED TO LIFELONG EXILE AND HARD LABOUR IN SIBERIA AFTER HIS BANISHMENT PRASCOVIE
6356-271890-0069 WHO WAS THEN LIVING AT MOSCOW WAS DETECTED BY THE POLICE DISTRIBUTING SOME REVOLUTIONARY PAMPHLETS FOR WHICH SHE ALSO WAS SENT TO SIBERIA
6356-271890-0070 AT THE PRISON AT IRKUTSK FATHER AND DAUGHTER MET WHILE THERE PRINCE PAVLOVITCH KOSTOMAROFF THE GOVERNOR OF THE YENISEISK PROVINCE
6356-271890-0071 DISCOVERED HER AND OFFERED HER MARRIAGE
6356-271890-0072 THE PRINCE NOT BEING GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE IN WHICH HIS WIFE WAS IMPRISONED
6356-271890-0073 CONTROLLER OF THE PRISON WAS IGNORANT OF THE SECRET UNION BUT IT SO HAPPENED THAT HE ALSO BECAME ENAMOURED OF HIS FAIR CAPTIVE AT LENGTH IN RETURN FOR HER PROMISE TO MARRY HIM HE ALLOWED HER AND HER FATHER COMPARATIVE FREEDOM
6356-271890-0074 AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED THEY WERE NOT LONG IN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS FOR WITHIN A FORTNIGHT AIDED BY THE PRINCE AND PROVIDED WITH A PASSPORT OBTAINED BY HIM THEY MANAGED TO ESCAPE AND COME TO ENGLAND AND WHAT OF KOBITA
6356-271890-0075 HE QUICKLY DISCOVERED THE RUSE AND ASCERTAINED THAT THE PRINCE HAD CONNIVED AT THEIR ESCAPE OUR SECRET POLICE TRACKED THE FUGITIVES TO THEIR HIDING PLACE IN LONDON STILL UNAWARE THAT SHE WAS THE PRINCE'S WIFE KOBITA OBTAINED LEAVE OF ABSENCE
6356-271890-0076 BEFORE HIS ARRIVAL HOWEVER HE WROTE URGING HER TO MARRY HIM DECLARING THAT IF SHE REFUSED HE WOULD EXPOSE THE PRINCE AS AIDING AND ABETTING DANGEROUS NIHILISTS PRASCOVIE
6356-271890-0077 AND DEPRIVED OF LIBERTY WAS AT HER WITS ENDS SHE WAS IN DESPERATION WHEN TWO YEARS AGO KOBITA ARRIVED IN LONDON
6356-271890-0078 IN THE VICINITY AND OFFERED TO SEND HIS SERVANT TO DIRECT HIM TO THE HOUSE IN QUESTION TO THIS PRASCOVIE'S ADMIRER HAD NO OBJECTION AND SHAKING SOUVAROFF WARMLY BY THE HAND WISHED HIM AU REVOIR AND STARTED OFF ACCOMPANIED BY THE SERVANT
6356-271890-0079 IN SEARCH OF THE IMAGINARY NEIGHBOUR THE HAND SHAKING PROVED FATAL FOR HE HAD NOT WALKED FAR BEFORE HE FELL DEAD THE WHOLE THING HAD BEEN CAREFULLY PLANNED AND THE TRUSTY SERVANT
6356-271890-0080 WHO HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED HOW TO ACT EXTRACTED EVERYTHING FROM THE DEAD MAN'S POCKETS THAT WOULD LEAD TO IDENTIFICATION HENCE HIS BURIAL IN A NAMELESS GRAVE DO YOU ASSERT THAT HE WAS MURDERED
6356-271890-0081 AND WE LOST SIGHT OF THEM UNTIL SHE CALLED UPON YOU AND ACCOMPANIED YOU IN DISGUISE TO SIBERIA ONCE OR TWICE YOU VERY NARROWLY ESCAPED BEING APPREHENDED INDEED ON ONE OCCASION ORDERS WERE TELEGRAPHED
6356-271890-0082 TO TOMSK FOR THE ARREST OF YOUR COMPANION AND YOURSELF BECAUSE THE DECLARATION ON YOUR PASSPORT REGARDING
6356-271890-0083 WAS KNOWN TO BE FALSE BY THE INTERVENTION OF A HIGH OFFICIAL HOWEVER
6356-271890-0084 AND YOU WERE ALLOWED TO PASS WHAT HAS BECOME OF PRASCOVIE'S FATHER I ASKED IN ASTONISHMENT SURELY HE WAS NOT KOBITA'S MURDERER FOR THE MAN DIED OF HEART DISEASE YOU ARE MISTAKEN HE DIED OF OBEAH POISON
6356-271890-0085 SOUVAROFF WHO WAS ONCE A CONSUL IN HAYTI KNEW OF THE SECRET POISON WHICH THE NATIVES EXTRACT FROM THE GECKO LIZARD AND WHICH CANNOT BE DETECTED SO DEADLY IS IT THAT ONE DROP IS SUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE A FATAL RESULT
6356-271890-0086 AND THE MANNER IN WHICH HE ADMINISTERED IT WAS SOMEWHAT NOVEL HE PREPARED TO RECEIVE HIS ENEMY BY ALLOWING THE NAIL OF THE FOREFINGER OF HIS RIGHT HAND TO GROW LONG AFTERWARDS THINNING IT TO A POINT AS FINE AS A NEEDLE
6356-271890-0087 UPON THIS POINT HE PLACED THE POISON AND KEPT A GLOVE ON UNTIL KOBITA'S ARRIVAL THEN IN WISHING HIM ADIEU HE PRICKED THE SKIN OF HIS VICTIM WHILE SHAKING HANDS WITH HIM PRODUCING AN EFFECT SIMILAR TO SYNCOPE WHERE IS SOUVAROFF NOW
6356-271890-0088 DEAD HE RETURNED TO PETERSBURG AS SOON AS HIS DAUGHTER HAD LEFT WITH YOU BUT WAS ARRESTED AND PLACED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IN THE FORTRESS WHILE THERE HE WROTE A CONFESSION OF THE MURDER AND AFTERWARDS COMMITTED SUICIDE AND WILL THEY ARREST PRASCOVIE
