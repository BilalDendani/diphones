4957-23295-0000 THE NEXT MORNING WHEN LORD ELMWOOD AND SANDFORD MET AT BREAKFAST THE LATTER WAS PALE WITH FEAR FOR THE SUCCESS OF LADY ELMWOOD'S LETTER THE EARL WAS PALE TOO BUT THERE WAS BESIDES UPON HIS FACE SOMETHING WHICH EVIDENTLY MARKED HE WAS DISPLEASED
4957-23295-0001 SANDFORD OBSERVED IT AND WAS ALL HUMBLENESS BOTH IN HIS WORDS AND LOOKS IN ORDER TO SOFTEN HIM AS SOON AS THE BREAKFAST WAS REMOVED LORD ELMWOOD DREW THE LETTER FROM HIS POCKET AND HOLDING IT TOWARDS SANDFORD SAID THAT
4957-23295-0002 MAY BE OF MORE VALUE TO YOU THAN IT IS TO ME THEREFORE I GIVE IT YOU SANDFORD CALLED UP A LOOK OF SURPRISE AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW THE LETTER AGAIN TIS LADY ELMWOOD'S LETTER SAID LORD ELMWOOD AND I RETURN IT TO YOU FOR TWO REASONS
4957-23295-0003 SANDFORD TOOK IT AND PUTTING IT UP ASKED FEARFULLY WHAT THOSE TWO REASONS WERE FIRST
4957-23295-0004 YOU MAY HAVE CAUSE TO RECALL IT I KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE SAID REPLIED SANDFORD YOU HAVE SAID YOU GRANT LADY ELMWOOD'S REQUEST YOU CANNOT RECALL THESE WORDS NOR I MY GRATITUDE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HER REQUEST IS RETURNED HE NOT EXACTLY MY LORD
4957-23295-0005 I TOLD YOU BEFORE I DID NOT BUT IT IS NO DOUBT SOMETHING IN FAVOUR OF HER CHILD I THINK NOT HE REPLIED SUCH AS IT IS HOWEVER I GRANT IT BUT IN THE STRICTEST SENSE OF THE WORD NO FARTHER AND ONE NEGLECT
4957-23295-0006 TO SUFFER THAT SHE MAY RESIDE AT ONE OF MY SEATS DISPENSING AT THE SAME TIME WITH MY EVER SEEING HER AND YOU WILL COMPLY I WILL TILL SHE ENCROACHES ON THIS CONCESSION AND DARES TO HOPE FOR A GREATER
4957-23295-0007 I WILL WHILE SHE AVOIDS MY SIGHT OR THE GIVING ME ANY REMEMBRANCE OF HER BUT IF WHETHER BY DESIGN OR BY ACCIDENT I EVER SEE OR HEAR FROM HER THAT MOMENT MY COMPLIANCE TO HER MOTHER'S SUPPLICATION CEASES AND I ABANDON HER ONCE MORE
4957-23295-0008 SANDFORD SIGHED LORD ELMWOOD CONTINUED I AM GLAD HER REQUEST STOPPED WHERE IT DID I WOULD RATHER COMPLY WITH HER DESIRES THAN NOT AND I REJOICE THEY ARE SUCH AS I CAN GRANT WITH EASE AND HONOUR TO MYSELF I AM SELDOM NOW AT ELMWOOD CASTLE
4957-23295-0009 LET HER DAUGHTER GO THERE THE FEW WEEKS OR MONTHS I AM DOWN IN THE SUMMER SHE MAY EASILY IN THAT EXTENSIVE HOUSE AVOID ME WHILE SHE DOES SHE LIVES IN SECURITY WHEN SHE DOES NOT YOU KNOW MY RESOLUTION SANDFORD BOWED
4957-23295-0010 THE EARL RESUMED NOR CAN IT BE A HARDSHIP TO OBEY THIS COMMAND SHE CANNOT LAMENT THE SEPARATION FROM A PARENT WHOM SHE NEVER KNEW SANDFORD WAS GOING EAGERLY TO PROVE THE ERROR OF THAT ASSERTION BUT HE PREVENTED HIM SAYING IN A WORD
4957-23295-0011 WITHOUT FARTHER ARGUMENT IF SHE OBEYS ME IN THIS I WILL PROVIDE FOR HER AS MY DAUGHTER DURING MY LIFE AND LEAVE HER A FORTUNE AT MY DEATH BUT IF SHE DARES SANDFORD INTERRUPTED THE MENACE PREPARED FOR UTTERANCE SAYING AND YOU STILL MEAN I SUPPOSE TO MAKE MISTER RUSHBROOK YOUR HEIR
4957-23295-0012 HAVE YOU NOT HEARD ME SAY SO AND DO YOU IMAGINE I HAVE CHANGED MY DETERMINATION I AM NOT GIVEN TO ALTER MY RESOLUTIONS MISTER SANDFORD AND I THOUGHT YOU KNEW I WAS NOT BESIDES WILL NOT MY TITLE BE EXTINCT WHOEVER I MAKE MY HEIR
4957-23295-0013 YOU MAY REMEMBER HOW TROUBLESOME IT WAS TO CONQUER MY STUBBORN DISPOSITION IN MY YOUTH THEN INDEED YOU DID BUT IN MY MORE ADVANCED AGE YOU WILL FIND THE TASK TOO DIFFICULT SANDFORD AGAIN REPEATED HE SHOULD NOT PRESUME
4957-23295-0014 YOU KNOW IT MUST BE YOUR OWN FAULT AND AS THIS IS A THEME THE MOST LIKELY OF ANY NAY THE ONLY ONE ON WHICH WE CAN HAVE A DIFFERENCE SUCH AS WE CANNOT FORGIVE TAKE CARE NEVER FROM THIS DAY TO RESUME IT INDEED
4957-23295-0015 THAT OF ITSELF WOULD BE AN OFFENCE I COULD NOT PARDON I HAVE BEEN CLEAR AND EXPLICIT IN ALL I HAVE SAID THERE CAN BE NO FEAR OF MISTAKING MY MEANING THEREFORE ALL FUTURE EXPLANATION IS UNNECESSARY
4957-23295-0016 WITHOUT SHEWING MY RESENTMENT EVEN TO THE HOUR OF MY DEATH HE WAS GOING OUT OF THE ROOM BUT BEFORE WE BID ADIEU TO THE SUBJECT FOR EVER MY LORD THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON WHOM I NAMED TO YOU DO YOU MEAN MISS WOODLEY OH BY ALL MEANS LET HER LIVE AT ELMWOOD HOUSE TOO
4957-23295-0017 PREPARED TO SET OFF FOR THEIR HABITATION IN ORDER HIMSELF TO CONDUCT THEM FROM THENCE TO ELMWOOD CASTLE AND APPOINT SOME RETIRED PART OF IT FOR LADY MATILDA AGAINST THE ANNUAL VISIT HER FATHER SHOULD PAY THERE BUT BEFORE HE LEFT LONDON GIFFARD THE STEWARD
4957-23295-0018 TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY TO WAIT UPON HIM AND LET HIM KNOW THAT HIS LORD HAD ACQUAINTED HIM WITH THE CONSENT HE HAD GIVEN FOR HIS DAUGHTER TO BE ADMITTED AT ELMWOOD CASTLE AND UPON WHAT RESTRICTIONS THAT HE HAD FARTHER UTTERED THE SEVEREST THREATS
4957-23295-0019 SHOULD THESE RESTRICTIONS EVER BE INFRINGED SANDFORD THANKED GIFFARD FOR HIS FRIENDLY INFORMATION IT SERVED HIM AS A SECOND WARNING OF THE CIRCUMSPECTION THAT WAS NECESSARY AND HAVING TAKEN LEAVE OF HIS FRIEND AND PATRON
4957-23295-0020 THEY BOTH LOVED HIM SINCERELY MORE ESPECIALLY LADY MATILDA WHOSE FORLORN STATE AND INNOCENT SUFFERINGS HAD EVER EXCITED HIS COMPASSION AND CAUSED HIM TO TREAT HER WITH AFFECTION TENDERNESS AND RESPECT SHE KNEW TOO HOW MUCH HE HAD BEEN HER MOTHER'S FRIEND
4957-23295-0021 FOR THAT SHE ALSO LOVED HIM AND FOR BEING HONOURED WITH THE FRIENDSHIP OF HER FATHER SHE LOOKED UP TO HIM WITH REVERENCE FOR MATILDA WITH AN EXCELLENT UNDERSTANDING A SEDATENESS ABOVE HER YEARS AND EARLY ACCUSTOMED TO THE MOST PRIVATE CONVERSE
4957-23295-0022 BETWEEN LADY ELMWOOD AND MISS WOODLEY WAS PERFECTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE WHOLE FATAL HISTORY OF HER MOTHER AND WAS BY HER TAUGHT THE RESPECT AND ADMIRATION OF HER FATHER'S VIRTUES WHICH THEY JUSTLY MERITED NOTWITHSTANDING THE JOY OF MISTER SANDFORD'S PRESENCE
4957-23295-0023 ONCE MORE TO CHEER THEIR SOLITARY DWELLING NO SOONER WERE THE FIRST KIND GREETINGS OVER THAN THE DREAD OF WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO INFORM THEM OF POSSESSED POOR MATILDA AND MISS WOODLEY SO POWERFULLY THAT ALL THEIR GLADNESS WAS CHANGED INTO AFFRIGHT
4957-23295-0024 THEIR APPREHENSIONS WERE FAR MORE FORCIBLE THAN THEIR CURIOSITY THEY DARED NOT ASK A QUESTION AND EVEN BEGAN TO WISH HE WOULD CONTINUE SILENT UPON THE SUBJECT ON WHICH THEY FEARED TO LISTEN FOR NEAR TWO HOURS HE WAS SO
4957-23295-0025 AT LENGTH AFTER A SHORT INTERVAL FROM SPEAKING DURING WHICH THEY WAITED WITH ANXIETY FOR WHAT HE MIGHT NEXT SAY HE TURNED TO LADY MATILDA AND SAID YOU DON'T ASK FOR YOUR FATHER MY DEAR I DID NOT KNOW IT WAS PROPER SHE REPLIED TIMIDLY
4957-23295-0026 IT IS ALWAYS PROPER ANSWERED SANDFORD FOR YOU TO THINK OF HIM THOUGH HE SHOULD NEVER THINK ON YOU SHE BURST INTO TEARS AND SAID THAT SHE DID THINK OF HIM BUT SHE FELT AN APPREHENSION OF MENTIONING HIS NAME AND SHE WEPT BITTERLY WHILE SHE SPOKE DO NOT THINK I REPROVED YOU
4957-23295-0027 SAID SANDFORD I ONLY TOLD YOU WHAT WAS RIGHT NAY SAID MISS WOODLEY SHE DOES NOT WEEP FOR THAT SHE FEARS HER FATHER HAS NOT COMPLIED WITH HER MOTHER'S REQUEST PERHAPS NOT EVEN READ HER LETTER YES HE HAS READ IT RETURNED SANDFORD
4957-23295-0028 OH HEAVENS EXCLAIMED MATILDA CLASPING HER HANDS TOGETHER AND THE TEARS FALLING STILL FASTER DO NOT BE SO MUCH ALARMED MY DEAR SAID MISS WOODLEY YOU KNOW WE ARE PREPARED FOR THE WORST AND YOU KNOW YOU PROMISED YOUR MOTHER WHATEVER YOUR FATE SHOULD BE TO SUBMIT WITH PATIENCE
4957-23295-0029 YES REPLIED MATILDA AND I AM PREPARED FOR EVERY THING BUT MY FATHER'S REFUSAL TO MY DEAR MOTHER YOUR FATHER HAS NOT REFUSED YOUR MOTHER'S REQUEST REPLIED SANDFORD SHE WAS LEAPING FROM HER SEAT IN ECSTASY BUT
4957-23295-0030 NOT ENTIRELY REPLIED MATILDA AND SINCE IT IS GRANTED I AM CARELESS BUT SHE TOLD ME HER LETTER CONCERNED NONE BUT ME TO EXPLAIN PERFECTLY TO MATILDA LADY ELMWOOD'S LETTER AND THAT SHE MIGHT PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND UPON WHAT TERMS SHE WAS ADMITTED INTO ELMWOOD CASTLE
4957-23295-0031 SANDFORD NOW READ THE LETTER TO HER AND REPEATED AS NEARLY AS HE COULD REMEMBER THE WHOLE OF THE CONVERSATION THAT PASSED BETWEEN LORD ELMWOOD AND HIMSELF NOT EVEN SPARING THROUGH AN ERRONEOUS DELICACY ANY OF THOSE THREATS HER FATHER HAD DENOUNCED
4957-23295-0032 AND THIS LITTLE BOUNTY JUST OBTAINED WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN GREATER IN HER MOTHER'S ESTIMATION THAN IT WAS NOW IN HERS MISS WOODLEY TOO SMILED AT THE PROSPECT BEFORE HER SHE ESTEEMED LORD ELMWOOD BEYOND ANY MORTAL LIVING
4957-23295-0033 AND OVERJOYED AT THE PROSPECT OF BEING ONCE AGAIN IN HIS COMPANY PAINTING AT THE SAME TIME A THOUSAND BRIGHT HOPES FROM WATCHING EVERY EMOTION OF HIS SOUL AND CATCHING EVERY PROPER OCCASION TO EXCITE OR INCREASE HIS PATERNAL SENTIMENTS
4957-23295-0034 YET SHE HAD THE PRUDENCE TO CONCEAL THOSE VAGUE HOPES FROM HIS CHILD LEST A DISAPPOINTMENT MIGHT PROVE FATAL AND ASSUMING A BEHAVIOUR NEITHER TOO MUCH ELATED OR DEPRESSED SHE ADVISED THAT THEY SHOULD HOPE FOR THE BEST BUT YET AS USUAL EXPECT AND PREPARE FOR THE WORST
