1933-146437-0000 MISS KATE AND MISS JULIA WERE THERE GOSSIPING AND LAUGHING AND FUSSING WALKING AFTER EACH OTHER TO THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS PEERING DOWN OVER THE BANISTERS AND CALLING DOWN TO LILY TO ASK HER WHO HAD COME IT WAS ALWAYS A GREAT AFFAIR THE MISSES MORKAN'S ANNUAL DANCE

1933-146437-0002 AS LONG AS ANYONE COULD REMEMBER EVER SINCE KATE AND JULIA AFTER THE DEATH OF THEIR BROTHER PAT HAD LEFT THE HOUSE IN STONEY BATTER AND TAKEN MARY JANE THEIR ONLY NIECE TO LIVE WITH THEM IN THE DARK GAUNT HOUSE ON USHER'S ISLAND THE UPPER PART OF WHICH THEY HAD RENTED FROM MISTER FULHAM THE CORN FACTOR ON THE GROUND FLOOR
1933-146437-0003 MARY JANE WHO WAS THEN A LITTLE GIRL IN SHORT CLOTHES WAS NOW THE MAIN PROP OF THE HOUSEHOLD FOR SHE HAD THE ORGAN IN HADDINGTON ROAD SHE HAD BEEN THROUGH THE ACADEMY AND GAVE A PUPILS CONCERT EVERY YEAR IN THE UPPER ROOM OF THE ANTIENT CONCERT ROOMS

1933-146437-0006 THREE SHILLING TEA AND THE BEST BOTTLED STOUT BUT LILY SELDOM MADE A MISTAKE IN THE ORDERS SO THAT SHE GOT ON WELL WITH HER THREE MISTRESSES THEY WERE FUSSY THAT WAS ALL BUT THE ONLY THING THEY WOULD NOT STAND WAS BACK ANSWERS OF COURSE
1933-146437-0007 THEY HAD GOOD REASON TO BE FUSSY ON SUCH A NIGHT AND THEN IT WAS LONG AFTER TEN O'CLOCK AND YET THERE WAS NO SIGN OF GABRIEL AND HIS WIFE BESIDES THEY WERE DREADFULLY AFRAID THAT FREDDY MALINS MIGHT TURN UP SCREWED THEY WOULD NOT WISH FOR WORLDS THAT ANY OF MARY JANE'S PUPILS SHOULD SEE HIM UNDER THE INFLUENCE
1933-146437-0008 IT WAS SOMETIMES VERY HARD TO MANAGE HIM FREDDY MALINS ALWAYS CAME LATE BUT THEY WONDERED WHAT COULD BE KEEPING GABRIEL AND THAT WAS WHAT BROUGHT THEM EVERY TWO MINUTES TO THE BANISTERS TO ASK LILY HAD GABRIEL OR FREDDY COME O MISTER CONROY
1933-146437-0009 SAID LILY TO GABRIEL WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR FOR HIM MISS KATE AND MISS JULIA THOUGHT YOU WERE NEVER COMING GOOD NIGHT MISSUS CONROY I'LL ENGAGE THEY DID SAID GABRIEL BUT THEY FORGET THAT MY WIFE HERE TAKES THREE MORTAL HOURS TO DRESS HERSELF
1933-146437-0010 HE STOOD ON THE MAT SCRAPING THE SNOW FROM HIS GOLOSHES WHILE LILY LED HIS WIFE TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS AND CALLED OUT MISS KATE HERE'S MISSUS CONROY KATE AND JULIA CAME TODDLING DOWN THE DARK STAIRS AT ONCE

1933-146437-0012 HE CONTINUED SCRAPING HIS FEET VIGOROUSLY WHILE THE THREE WOMEN WENT UPSTAIRS LAUGHING TO THE LADIES DRESSING ROOM A LIGHT FRINGE OF SNOW LAY LIKE A CAPE ON THE SHOULDERS OF HIS OVERCOAT
1933-146437-0013 AND AS THE BUTTONS OF HIS OVERCOAT SLIPPED WITH A SQUEAKING NOISE THROUGH THE SNOW STIFFENED FRIEZE A COLD FRAGRANT AIR FROM OUT OF DOORS ESCAPED FROM CREVICES AND FOLDS IS IT SNOWING AGAIN MISTER CONROY ASKED LILY
1933-146437-0014 SHE HAD PRECEDED HIM INTO THE PANTRY TO HELP HIM OFF WITH HIS OVERCOAT
1933-146437-0015 AND GLANCED AT HER SHE WAS A SLIM GROWING GIRL PALE IN COMPLEXION AND WITH HAY COLOURED HAIR THE GAS IN THE PANTRY MADE HER LOOK STILL PALER GABRIEL HAD KNOWN HER WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD AND USED TO SIT ON THE LOWEST STEP NURSING A RAG DOLL YES LILY HE ANSWERED
1933-146437-0016 AND I THINK WE'RE IN FOR A NIGHT OF IT HE LOOKED UP AT THE PANTRY CEILING WHICH WAS SHAKING WITH THE STAMPING AND SHUFFLING OF FEET ON THE FLOOR ABOVE LISTENED FOR A MOMENT TO THE PIANO AND THEN GLANCED AT THE GIRL WHO WAS FOLDING HIS OVERCOAT CAREFULLY AT THE END OF A SHELF
1933-146437-0017 TELL ME LILY HE SAID IN A FRIENDLY TONE
1933-146437-0018 O NO SIR SHE ANSWERED I'M DONE SCHOOLING THIS YEAR AND MORE O THEN SAID GABRIEL GAILY
1933-146437-0019 THE GIRL GLANCED BACK AT HIM OVER HER SHOULDER AND SAID WITH GREAT BITTERNESS
1933-146437-0020 GABRIEL COLOURED AS IF HE FELT HE HAD MADE A MISTAKE AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER KICKED OFF HIS GOLOSHES AND FLICKED ACTIVELY WITH HIS MUFFLER AT HIS PATENT LEATHER SHOES HE WAS A STOUT TALLISH YOUNG MAN
1933-146437-0021 THE HIGH COLOUR OF HIS CHEEKS PUSHED UPWARDS EVEN TO HIS FOREHEAD WHERE IT SCATTERED ITSELF IN A FEW FORMLESS PATCHES OF PALE RED AND ON HIS HAIRLESS FACE THERE SCINTILLATED RESTLESSLY THE POLISHED LENSES AND THE BRIGHT GILT RIMS OF THE GLASSES WHICH SCREENED HIS DELICATE AND RESTLESS EYES
1933-146437-0022 HIS GLOSSY BLACK HAIR WAS PARTED IN THE MIDDLE AND BRUSHED IN A LONG CURVE BEHIND HIS EARS WHERE IT CURLED SLIGHTLY BENEATH THE GROOVE LEFT BY HIS HAT
1933-146437-0023 THEN HE TOOK A COIN RAPIDLY FROM HIS POCKET O LILY HE SAID THRUSTING IT INTO HER HANDS IT'S CHRISTMASTIME ISN'T IT JUST HERE'S A LITTLE HE WALKED RAPIDLY TOWARDS THE DOOR O NO SIR CRIED THE GIRL FOLLOWING HIM REALLY SIR I WOULDN'T TAKE IT
1933-146437-0024 THE GIRL SEEING THAT HE HAD GAINED THE STAIRS CALLED OUT AFTER HIM WELL THANK YOU SIR HE WAITED OUTSIDE THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR UNTIL THE WALTZ SHOULD FINISH LISTENING TO THE SKIRTS THAT SWEPT AGAINST IT AND TO THE SHUFFLING OF FEET
1933-146437-0025 HE WAS STILL DISCOMPOSED BY THE GIRL'S BITTER AND SUDDEN RETORT IT HAD CAST A GLOOM OVER HIM WHICH HE TRIED TO DISPEL BY ARRANGING HIS CUFFS AND THE BOWS OF HIS TIE HE THEN TOOK FROM HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET A LITTLE PAPER AND GLANCED AT THE HEADINGS HE HAD MADE FOR HIS SPEECH
1933-146437-0026 HE WAS UNDECIDED ABOUT THE LINES FROM ROBERT BROWNING FOR HE FEARED THEY WOULD BE ABOVE THE HEADS OF HIS HEARERS SOME QUOTATION THAT THEY WOULD RECOGNISE FROM SHAKESPEARE OR FROM THE MELODIES WOULD BE BETTER THE INDELICATE CLACKING OF THE MEN'S HEELS
1933-146437-0027 AND THE SHUFFLING OF THEIR SOLES REMINDED HIM THAT THEIR GRADE OF CULTURE DIFFERED FROM HIS HE WOULD ONLY MAKE HIMSELF RIDICULOUS BY QUOTING POETRY TO THEM WHICH THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEY WOULD THINK THAT HE WAS AIRING HIS SUPERIOR EDUCATION
1933-146437-0028 HIS WHOLE SPEECH WAS A MISTAKE FROM FIRST TO LAST AN UTTER FAILURE JUST THEN HIS AUNTS AND HIS WIFE CAME OUT OF THE LADIES DRESSING ROOM HIS AUNTS WERE TWO SMALL PLAINLY DRESSED OLD WOMEN AUNT JULIA WAS AN INCH OR SO THE TALLER HER HAIR
