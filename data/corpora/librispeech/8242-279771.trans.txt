8242-279771-0000 HOWEVER A GOOD FAIRY WHO PRESIDED AT HIS BIRTH ASSURED HIS MOTHER THAT THOUGH UGLY HE WOULD HAVE SO MUCH SENSE AND WIT THAT HE WOULD NEVER BE DISAGREEABLE MOREOVER SHE BESTOWED ON HIM THE POWER OF COMMUNICATING THESE GIFTS
8242-279771-0001 TO THE PERSON HE SHOULD LOVE BEST IN THE WORLD AT THIS THE QUEEN WAS A LITTLE COMFORTED AND BECAME STILL MORE SO WHEN AS SOON AS HE COULD SPEAK THE INFANT BEGAN TO SAY SUCH PRETTY AND CLEVER THINGS THAT EVERYBODY WAS CHARMED WITH HIM
8242-279771-0002 HAD TWO LITTLE DAUGHTERS TWINS AT WHOSE BIRTH THE SAME FAIRY PRESIDED THE ELDER TWIN WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE DAY THE YOUNGER SO EXTREMELY UGLY THAT THE MOTHER'S EXTRAVAGANT JOY IN THE FIRST
8242-279771-0003 WHILE THE OTHER WOULD GROW UP SO CLEVER AND CHARMING THAT NOBODY WOULD MISS HER WANT OF BEAUTY HEAVEN GRANT IT SIGHED THE QUEEN BUT ARE THERE NO MEANS OF GIVING A LITTLE SENSE TO THE ONE WHO IS SO BEAUTIFUL
8242-279771-0004 I CAN DO NOTHING FOR HER MADAM RETURNED THE FAIRY NOTHING AS REGARDS HER OWN FORTUNES BUT I GRANT HER THE POWER OF MAKING THE PERSON WHO BEST PLEASES HER AS HANDSOME AS HERSELF
8242-279771-0005 THE ONE BECAME UGLIER AND THE OTHER MORE STUPID DAY BY DAY UNLUCKY FAIR ONE SHE NEVER HAD A WORD TO SAY FOR HERSELF OR ELSE IT WAS THE SILLIEST WORD IMAGINABLE
8242-279771-0006 AND SHE WAS SO AWKWARD THAT SHE COULD NOT PLACE FOUR TEACUPS IN A ROW WITHOUT BREAKING AT LEAST ONE OF THEM NOR DRINK A GLASS OF WATER WITHOUT SPILLING HALF OF IT OVER HER CLOTHES BEAUTY IS A GREAT CHARM
8242-279771-0007 YET WHENEVER THE SISTERS WENT OUT TOGETHER THOSE WHO WERE ATTRACTED BY THE ELDER'S LOVELY FACE IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR WERE SURE TO BE SEEN AT THE SIDE OF THE YOUNGER LAUGHING AT HER WITTY AND PLEASANT SAYINGS
8242-279771-0008 SHE SAW COMING TOWARDS HER A LITTLE MAN VERY UGLY BUT MAGNIFICENTLY DRESSED WHO SHOULD THIS BE BUT PRINCE RIQUET WITH THE TUFT HE HAD SEEN HER PORTRAIT HAD FALLEN DESPERATELY IN LOVE WITH HER
8242-279771-0009 AND SECRETLY QUITTED HIS FATHER'S KINGDOM THAT HE MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF MEETING HER DELIGHTED TO FIND HER ALONE HE CAME FORWARD WITH ALL THE RESPECT AND POLITENESS IMAGINABLE BUT HE COULD NOT HELP NOTICING HOW VERY MELANCHOLY SHE WAS
8242-279771-0010 AND THAT ALL THE ELEGANT COMPLIMENTS HE MADE HER DID NOT SEEM TO AFFECT HER IN THE LEAST I CANNOT COMPREHEND MADAM SAID HE HOW SO CHARMING AND LOVELY A LADY CAN BE SO VERY SAD

8242-279771-0012 ONE WOULD NEVER TROUBLE ONESELF ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE
8242-279771-0013 MADAM SAID RIQUET POLITELY THOUGH HER SPEECH WAS NOT EXACTLY CIVIL NOTHING SHOWS INTELLECT SO MUCH AS THE MODESTY OF BELIEVING ONE DOES NOT POSSESS IT
8242-279771-0014 FOR I HAVE THE POWER OF MAKING THE PERSON I LOVE BEST AS CLEVER AS I PLEASE I WILL DO IT PROVIDED YOU CONSENT TO MARRY ME THE PRINCESS STOOD DUMB WITH ASTONISHMENT SHE
8242-279771-0015 NOW THE YOUNG LADY WAS SO STUPID THAT SHE THOUGHT A YEAR'S END WAS A LONG WAY OFF SO LONG THAT IT SEEMED AS IF IT MIGHT NOT COME AT ALL OR SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN BETWEEN WHILES
8242-279771-0016 AND SHE HAD SUCH A LONGING TO BE CLEVER AND ADMIRED THAT SHE THOUGHT AT ALL RISKS SHE WOULD ACCEPT THE CHANCE OF BECOMING SO
8242-279771-0017 NO SOONER HAD SHE SAID IT THAN SHE FELT HERSELF QUITE ANOTHER BEING SHE FOUND SHE COULD AT ONCE SAY ANYTHING SHE CHOSE AND SAY IT IN THE MOST GRACEFUL AND BRILLIANT WAY SHE BEGAN A LIVELY CONVERSATION WITH PRINCE RIQUET
8242-279771-0018 PRINCES CAME IN THRONGS TO ASK IN MARRIAGE THIS WONDERFUL PRINCESS WHO WAS AS CLEVER AS SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT SHE FOUND NONE TO SUIT HER PROBABLY BECAUSE THE MORE SENSE A LADY HAS THE MORE DIFFICULT SHE IS TO PLEASE
8242-279771-0019 AS FOR HER PROMISE TO RIQUET WITH THE TUFT BEING GIVEN IN THE DAYS WHEN SHE WAS SO DULL AND STUPID IT NOW NEVER ONCE CAME INTO HER HEAD UNTIL ONE DAY BEING QUITE PERPLEXED BY HER NUMEROUS SUITORS
8242-279771-0020 SHE WENT TO TAKE A SOLITARY WALK AND THINK THE MATTER OVER WHEN BY CHANCE SHE CAME INTO THE SAME WOOD WHERE SHE HAD MET THE PRINCE
8242-279771-0021 FETCH ME THAT SPIT CRIED ONE PUT SOME MORE WOOD ON THAT FIRE SAID ANOTHER AND BY AND BY THE EARTH OPENED SHOWING A GREAT KITCHEN FILLED WITH COOKS COOKING A SPLENDID BANQUET THEY WERE ALL WORKING MERRILY AT THEIR SEVERAL DUTIES

8242-279771-0024 ALL AT ONCE RECOLLECTING HER PROMISE AT WHICH SHE WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE SHOULD HAVE FALLEN TO THE EARTH GREATER STILL WAS HER ALARM WHEN AT ONLY A FEW STEPS DISTANCE SHE BEHELD RIQUET DRESSED SPLENDIDLY LIKE A PRINCE AND A BRIDEGROOM
8242-279771-0025 SAID THE LADY FRANKLY I MUST CONFESS THAT SUCH WAS NOT MY INTENTION AND I FEAR I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO AS YOU DESIRE YOU SURPRISE ME MADAM I CAN WELL BELIEVE IT
8242-279771-0026 AND IF I HAD TO DO WITH A BRUTE INSTEAD OF A GENTLEMAN OF SENSE AND FEELING I SHOULD BE VERY UNEASY RETURNED SHE BUT SINCE I SPEAK WITH THE CLEVEREST MAN IN THE WORLD I AM SURE HE WILL HEAR REASON AND WILL NOT BIND ME
8242-279771-0027 NOW A SENSIBLE WOMAN TO A PROMISE I MADE WHEN I WAS ONLY A FOOL IF I WERE A FOOL MYSELF MADAM I MIGHT WELL COMPLAIN OF YOUR BROKEN PROMISE AND BEING AS YOU SAY A MAN OF SENSE

8242-279771-0031 AND HER HEART BEING GREATLY SOFTENED TOWARDS HIM SHE WISHED THAT HE MIGHT BECOME THE HANDSOMEST PRINCE IN ALL THE WORLD
8242-279771-0032 NO SOONER HAD SHE DONE SO THAN RIQUET WITH THE TUFT APPEARED IN HER EYES THE MOST ELEGANT YOUNG MAN SHE HAD EVER SEEN ILL NATURED PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT THIS WAS NO FAIRY GIFT BUT THAT LOVE CREATED THE CHANGE
8242-279771-0033 THEY DECLARE THAT THE PRINCESS WHEN SHE THOUGHT OVER HER LOVER'S PERSEVERANCE PATIENCE GOOD HUMOUR AND DISCRETION AND COUNTED HIS NUMEROUS FINE QUALITIES OF MIND AND DISPOSITION SAW NO LONGER THE DEFORMITY OF HIS BODY
8242-279771-0034 SEEMED ALWAYS LOOKING ON ALL SIDES FOR HER IN TOKEN OF HIS VIOLENT LOVE AND HIS GREAT RED NOSE GAVE HIM AN AIR VERY MARTIAL AND HEROIC HOWEVER THIS MAY BE IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE PRINCESS MARRIED HIM
