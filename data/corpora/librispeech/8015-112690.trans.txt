8015-112690-0000 ALL THE PRISONS OF SPAIN WERE THROWN OPEN AND ALL THE PRISONERS RECEIVED THEIR FREEDOM AS IF THE EVENT THE MOST HONORABLE AND MOST FORTUNATE HAD HAPPENED TO THE MONARCHY
8015-112690-0001 AND EVERY SUMPTUARY LAW WITH REGARD TO APPAREL WAS SUSPENDED DURING CHARLES'S RESIDENCE IN SPAIN THE INFANTA HOWEVER WAS ONLY SHOWN TO HER LOVER IN PUBLIC THE SPANISH IDEAS OF DECENCY BEING SO STRICT
8015-112690-0002 AS NOT TO ALLOW OF ANY FURTHER INTERCOURSE TILL THE ARRIVAL OF THE DISPENSATION THE POINT OF HONOR WAS CARRIED SO FAR BY THAT GENEROUS PEOPLE THAT NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE ON ACCOUNT OF THE ADVANTAGE WHICH THEY HAD ACQUIRED
8015-112690-0003 OF IMPOSING ANY HARDER CONDITIONS OF TREATY THEIR PIOUS ZEAL ONLY PROMPTED THEM ON ONE OCCASION TO DESIRE MORE CONCESSIONS IN THE RELIGIOUS ARTICLES BUT UPON THE OPPOSITION OF BRISTOL ACCOMPANIED WITH SOME REPROACHES
8015-112690-0004 THEY IMMEDIATELY DESISTED THE POPE HOWEVER HEARING OF THE PRINCE'S ARRIVAL IN MADRID TACKED SOME NEW CLAUSES TO THE DISPENSATION AND IT BECAME NECESSARY TO TRANSMIT THE ARTICLES TO LONDON THAT THE KING MIGHT RATIFY THEM
8015-112690-0005 THIS TREATY WHICH WAS MADE PUBLIC CONSISTED OF SEVERAL ARTICLES CHIEFLY REGARDING THE EXERCISE OF THE CATHOLIC RELIGION BY THE INFANTA AND HER HOUSEHOLD
8015-112690-0006 NOTHING COULD REASONABLY BE FOUND FAULT WITH EXCEPT ONE ARTICLE IN WHICH THE KING PROMISED THAT THE CHILDREN SHOULD BE EDUCATED BY THE PRINCESS TILL TEN YEARS OF AGE THIS CONDITION COULD NOT BE INSISTED ON
8015-112690-0007 BUT WITH A VIEW OF SEASONING THEIR MINDS WITH CATHOLIC PRINCIPLES AND THOUGH SO TENDER AN AGE SEEMED A SUFFICIENT SECURITY AGAINST THEOLOGICAL PREJUDICES YET THE SAME REASON WHICH MADE THE POPE INSERT THAT ARTICLE
8015-112690-0008 A VERY CIVIL LETTER FROM THE POPE HE WAS INDUCED TO RETURN A VERY CIVIL ANSWER
8015-112690-0009 UPON THIS EVENT THE NUNCIO REFUSED TO DELIVER THE DISPENSATION TILL IT SHOULD BE RENEWED BY URBAN AND THAT CRAFTY PONTIFF DELAYED SENDING A NEW DISPENSATION IN HOPES THAT DURING THE PRINCE'S RESIDENCE IN SPAIN
8015-112690-0010 SOME EXPEDIENT MIGHT BE FALLEN UPON TO EFFECT HIS CONVERSION THE KING OF ENGLAND AS WELL AS THE PRINCE BECAME IMPATIENT ON THE FIRST HINT CHARLES OBTAINED PERMISSION TO RETURN AND PHILIP GRACED HIS DEPARTURE WITH ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES
8015-112690-0011 OF ELABORATE CIVILITY AND RESPECT WHICH HAD ATTENDED HIS RECEPTION HE EVEN ERECTED A PILLAR ON THE SPOT WHERE THEY TOOK LEAVE OF EACH OTHER AS A MONUMENT OF MUTUAL FRIENDSHIP AND THE PRINCE HAVING SWORN TO THE OBSERVANCE OF ALL THE ARTICLES
8015-112690-0012 ENTERED ON HIS JOURNEY AND EMBARKED ON BOARD THE ENGLISH FLEET AT SAINT ANDERO THE CHARACTER OF CHARLES COMPOSED OF DECENCY RESERVE MODESTY SOBRIETY VIRTUES SO AGREEABLE TO THE MANNERS OF THE SPANIARDS
8015-112690-0013 THE UNPARALLELED CONFIDENCE WHICH HE HAD REPOSED IN THEIR NATION THE ROMANTIC GALLANTRY WHICH HE HAD PRACTISED TOWARDS THE PRINCESS ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES JOINED TO HIS YOUTH AND ADVANTAGEOUS FIGURE HAD ENDEARED HIM TO THE WHOLE COURT OF MADRID
8015-112690-0014 AND HAD IMPRESSED THE MOST FAVORABLE IDEAS OF HIM BUT IN THE SAME PROPORTION THAT THE PRINCE WAS BELOVED AND ESTEEMED WAS BUCKINGHAM DESPISED AND HATED HIS BEHAVIOR COMPOSED OF ENGLISH FAMILIARITY AND FRENCH VIVACITY
8015-112690-0015 HIS SALLIES OF PASSION HIS INDECENT FREEDOMS WITH THE PRINCE HIS DISSOLUTE PLEASURES HIS ARROGANT IMPETUOUS TEMPER WHICH HE NEITHER COULD NOR CARED TO DISGUISE QUALITIES LIKE THESE COULD MOST OF THEM BE ESTEEMED NOWHERE
8015-112690-0016 BUT TO THE SPANIARDS WERE THE OBJECTS OF PECULIAR AVERSION THEY COULD NOT CONCEAL THEIR SURPRISE THAT SUCH A YOUTH COULD INTRUDE INTO A NEGOTIATION NOW CONDUCTED TO A PERIOD
8015-112690-0017 THAT HIS OWN ATTACHMENT TO THE SPANISH NATION AND TO THE KING OF SPAIN WAS EXTREME THAT HE WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO EVERY MEASURE WHICH COULD CEMENT THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN ENGLAND AND THEM AND THAT HIS PECULIAR AMBITION WOULD BE TO FACILITATE THE PRINCE'S MARRIAGE WITH THE INFANTA
8015-112690-0018 BUT HE ADDED WITH A SINCERITY EQUALLY INSOLENT AND INDISCREET WITH REGARD TO YOU SIR IN PARTICULAR YOU MUST NOT CONSIDER ME AS YOUR FRIEND BUT MUST EVER EXPECT FROM ME ALL POSSIBLE ENMITY AND OPPOSITION
8015-112690-0019 THAT HE VERY WILLINGLY ACCEPTED OF WHAT WAS PROFFERED HIM AND ON THESE TERMS THE FAVORITES PARTED BUCKINGHAM SENSIBLE HOW ODIOUS HE WAS BECOME TO THE SPANIARDS
8015-112690-0020 OF THE INFANTA RESOLVED TO EMPLOY ALL HIS CREDIT IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE MARRIAGE
8015-112690-0021 FROM WHOM HE HAD MET WITH SUCH GENEROUS TREATMENT BY WHAT COLORS HE COULD DISGUISE THE INGRATITUDE AND IMPRUDENCE OF SUCH A MEASURE THESE ARE TOTALLY UNKNOWN TO US WE MAY ONLY CONJECTURE THAT THE MANY UNAVOIDABLE CAUSES OF DELAY
8015-112690-0022 WHICH HAD SO LONG PREVENTED THE ARRIVAL OF THE DISPENSATION
8015-112690-0023 IT ALSO APPEARS THAT HIS IMPETUOUS AND DOMINEERING CHARACTER HAD ACQUIRED WHAT IT EVER AFTER MAINTAINED A TOTAL ASCENDANT OVER THE GENTLE AND MODEST TEMPER
8015-112690-0024 HE YIELDED TO DIFFICULTIES WHICH HE HAD NOT COURAGE OR STRENGTH OF MIND SUFFICIENT TO OVERCOME THE PRINCE THEREFORE AND BUCKINGHAM ON THEIR ARRIVAL AT LONDON ASSUMED ENTIRELY THE DIRECTION OF THE NEGOTIATION
8015-112690-0025 AND IT WAS THEIR BUSINESS TO SEEK FOR PRETENCES BY WHICH THEY COULD GIVE A COLOR TO THEIR INTENDED BREACH OF TREATY
8015-112690-0026 AS A PRELIMINARY ARTICLE TO THE CONCLUSION OF THE MARRIAGE TREATY HE CONSIDERED THAT THIS PRINCIPALITY WAS NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE EMPEROR AND THE DUKE OF BAVARIA AND THAT IT WAS NO LONGER IN THE KING OF SPAIN'S POWER BY A SINGLE STROKE OF HIS PEN
8015-112690-0027 THE STRICT ALLIANCE OF SPAIN WITH THESE PRINCES WOULD ENGAGE PHILIP HE THOUGHT TO SOFTEN SO DISAGREEABLE A DEMAND BY EVERY ART OF NEGOTIATION AND MANY ARTICLES MUST OF NECESSITY BE ADJUSTED
8015-112690-0028 BEFORE SUCH AN IMPORTANT POINT COULD BE EFFECTED IT WAS SUFFICIENT IN JAMES'S OPINION IF THE SINCERITY OF THE SPANISH COURT COULD FOR THE PRESENT BE ASCERTAINED AND DREADING FURTHER DELAYS OF THE MARRIAGE SO LONG WISHED FOR
8015-112690-0029 HE WAS RESOLVED TO TRUST THE PALATINE'S FULL RESTORATION TO THE EVENT OF FUTURE COUNSELS AND DELIBERATIONS THIS WHOLE SYSTEM OF NEGOTIATION BUCKINGHAM NOW REVERSED
8015-112690-0030 AND HE OVERTURNED EVERY SUPPOSITION UPON WHICH THE TREATY HAD HITHERTO BEEN CONDUCTED AFTER MANY FRUITLESS ARTIFICES WERE EMPLOYED TO DELAY OR PREVENT THE ESPOUSALS
8015-112690-0031 THE GREATEST INTERESTS OF HIS MASTER AND OF HIS COUNTRY HIS HAD EXPECTED THAT THE UNBOUNDED CREDIT OF THAT FAVORITE WOULD BE EMPLOYED TO EMBROIL THE TWO NATIONS DETERMINED HOWEVER
8015-112690-0032 TO THROW THE BLAME OF THE RUPTURE ENTIRELY ON THE ENGLISH HE DELIVERED INTO BRISTOL'S HAND A WRITTEN PROMISE
8015-112690-0033 OR BY EVERY OTHER POSSIBLE MEANS AND WHEN HE FOUND THAT THIS CONCESSION GAVE NO SATISFACTION HE ORDERED THE INFANTA TO LAY ASIDE THE TITLE OF PRINCESS OF WALES WHICH SHE BORE AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF THE DISPENSATION FROM ROME
8015-112690-0034 AND TO DROP THE STUDY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ANY THINKING THAT SUCH RASH COUNSELS AS NOW GOVERNED THE COURT OF ENGLAND WOULD NOT STOP AT THE BREACH OF THE MARRIAGE TREATY HE ORDERED PREPARATIONS FOR WAR IMMEDIATELY
8015-112690-0035 TO BE MADE THROUGHOUT ALL HIS DOMINIONS THUS JAMES HAVING BY MEANS INEXPLICABLE FROM THE ORDINARY RULES OF POLITICS CONDUCTED SO NEAR AN HONORABLE PERIOD THE MARRIAGE OF HIS SON AND THE RESTORATION OF HIS SON IN LAW
8015-112690-0036 FAILED AT LAST OF HIS PURPOSE BY MEANS EQUALLY UNACCOUNTABLE BUT THOUGH THE EXPEDIENTS ALREADY USED BY BUCKINGHAM WERE SUFFICIENTLY INGLORIOUS BOTH FOR HIMSELF AND FOR THE NATION IT WAS NECESSARY FOR HIM ERE HE COULD FULLY EFFECT HIS PURPOSE
8015-112690-0037 WAS OBLIGED TO CONCERT NEW MEASURES
8015-112690-0038 WHATEVER DISCOURAGEMENTS THEREFORE HE MIGHT RECEIVE FROM HIS ILL AGREEMENT WITH FORMER PARLIAMENTS THERE WAS A NECESSITY OF SUMMONING ONCE MORE THIS ASSEMBLY AND IT MIGHT BE HOPED THAT THE SPANISH ALLIANCE WHICH GAVE SUCH UMBRAGE
8015-112690-0039 IN HIS SPEECH TO THE HOUSES JAMES DROPPED SOME HINTS OF HIS CAUSE OF COMPLAINT AGAINST SPAIN AND HE GRACIOUSLY CONDESCENDED TO ASK THE ADVICE OF PARLIAMENT
8015-112690-0040 AND TO THROW ON THE COURT OF SPAIN THE REPROACH OF ARTIFICE AND INSINCERITY HE SAID THAT AFTER MANY YEARS NEGOTIATION THE KING FOUND NOT HIMSELF ANY NEARER HIS PURPOSE AND THAT BRISTOL HAD NEVER BROUGHT THE TREATY BEYOND GENERAL PROFESSIONS AND DECLARATIONS
8015-112690-0041 RESOLVED AT LAST TO TAKE A JOURNEY TO MADRID AND PUT THE MATTER TO THE UTMOST TRIAL THAT HE THERE FOUND SUCH ARTIFICIAL DEALING AS MADE HIM CONCLUDE ALL THE STEPS TAKEN TOWARDS THE MARRIAGE TO BE FALSE AND DECEITFUL
8015-112690-0042 WHICH HAD EVER BEEN REGARDED BY THE KING AS AN ESSENTIAL PRELIMINARY WAS NOT SERIOUSLY INTENDED BY SPAIN AND THAT AFTER ENDURING MUCH BAD USAGE
8015-112690-0043 OR OF RESTORING THE ELECTOR PALATINE THIS NARRATIVE WHICH CONSIDERING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE OCCASION AND THE SOLEMNITY OF THAT ASSEMBLY TO WHICH IT WAS DELIVERED DESERVES GREAT BLAME
8015-112690-0044 WAS YET VOUCHED FOR TRUTH BY THE PRINCE OF WALES WHO WAS PRESENT AND THE KING HIMSELF LENT IT INDIRECTLY HIS AUTHORITY BY TELLING THE PARLIAMENT THAT IT WAS BY HIS ORDERS BUCKINGHAM LAID THE WHOLE AFFAIR BEFORE THEM
8015-112690-0045 IT IS IN VAIN TO PLEAD THE YOUTH AND INEXPERIENCE OF CHARLES
8015-112690-0046 REALLY LED HIM INTO ERROR AND MADE HIM SWALLOW ALL THE FALSITIES OF BUCKINGHAM AND THOUGH THE KING WAS HERE HURRIED FROM HIS OWN MEASURES
8015-112690-0047 SO LONG WISHED FOR OF GOING TO WAR WITH PAPISTS THEY LITTLE THOUGHT OF FUTURE CONSEQUENCES BUT IMMEDIATELY ADVISED THE KING TO BREAK OFF BOTH TREATIES WITH SPAIN AS WELL THAT WHICH REGARDED THE MARRIAGE
8015-112690-0048 AS THAT FOR THE RESTITUTION OF THE PALATINATE THE PEOPLE EVER GREEDY OF WAR TILL THEY SUFFER BY IT DISPLAYED THEIR TRIUMPH AT THESE VIOLENT MEASURES BY PUBLIC BONFIRES AND REJOICINGS AND BY INSULTS ON THE SPANISH MINISTERS
8015-112690-0049 BUCKINGHAM WAS NOW THE FAVORITE OF THE PUBLIC AND OF THE PARLIAMENT SIR EDWARD COKE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CALLED HIM THE SAVIOR OF THE NATION EVERY PLACE RESOUNDED WITH HIS PRAISES AND HE HIMSELF INTOXICATED BY A POPULARITY
8015-112690-0050 WHICH HE ENJOYED SO LITTLE TIME AND WHICH HE SO ILL DESERVED VIOLATED ALL DUTY TO HIS INDULGENT MASTER AND ENTERED INTO CABALS WITH THE PURITANICAL MEMBERS
8015-112690-0051 AND BESIDES SUPPLIES FROM TIME TO TIME AS THEY SHOULD BECOME NECESSARY HE DEMANDED A VOTE OF SIX SUBSIDIES AND TWELVE FIFTEENTHS AS A PROPER STOCK BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF HOSTILITIES
8015-112690-0052 AND THAT IT WAS SUFFICIENT FOR HIM IF THE HONOR AND SECURITY OF THE PUBLIC WERE PROVIDED FOR TO REMOVE ALL SUSPICION HE WHO HAD EVER STRENUOUSLY MAINTAINED HIS PREROGATIVE
8015-112690-0053 NOW MADE AN IMPRUDENT CONCESSION OF WHICH THE CONSEQUENCES MIGHT HAVE PROVED FATAL TO ROYAL AUTHORITY HE VOLUNTARILY OFFERED THAT THE MONEY VOTED SHOULD BE PAID TO A COMMITTEE OF PARLIAMENT
8015-112690-0054 AND SHOULD BE ISSUED BY THEM WITHOUT BEING INTRUSTED TO HIS MANAGEMENT THE COMMONS WILLINGLY ACCEPTED OF THIS CONCESSION SO UNUSUAL IN AN ENGLISH MONARCH THEY VOTED HIM ONLY THREE SUBSIDIES AND THREE FIFTEENTHS
8015-112690-0055 ADVANTAGE WAS ALSO TAKEN OF THE PRESENT GOOD AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE KING AND PARLIAMENT IN ORDER TO PASS THE BILL AGAINST MONOPOLIES WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THE KING BUT WHICH HAD FAILED BY THE RUPTURE BETWEEN HIM AND THE LAST HOUSE OF COMMONS
8015-112690-0056 THIS BILL WAS CONCEIVED IN SUCH TERMS AS TO RENDER IT MERELY DECLARATORY AND ALL MONOPOLIES WERE CONDEMNED AS CONTRARY TO LAW AND TO THE KNOWN LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE
8015-112690-0057 IT WAS THERE SUPPOSED THAT EVERY SUBJECT OF ENGLAND HAD ENTIRE POWER TO DISPOSE OF HIS OWN ACTIONS PROVIDED HE DID NO INJURY TO ANY OF HIS FELLOW SUBJECTS AND THAT NO PREROGATIVE OF THE KING NO POWER OF ANY MAGISTRATE
8015-112690-0058 THE EARL OF MIDDLESEX HAD BEEN RAISED BY BUCKINGHAM'S INTEREST FROM THE RANK OF A LONDON MERCHANT TO BE TREASURER OF ENGLAND AND BY HIS ACTIVITY AND ADDRESS SEEMED NOT UNWORTHY OF THAT PREFERMENT
8015-112690-0059 DURING THE PRINCE'S RESIDENCE IN SPAIN THAT FAVORITE VOWED REVENGE AND EMPLOYED ALL HIS CREDIT AMONG THE COMMONS TO PROCURE AN IMPEACHMENT OF THE TREASURER THE KING WAS EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED WITH THIS MEASURE
8015-112690-0060 AND PROPHESIED TO THE PRINCE AND DUKE THAT THEY WOULD LIVE TO HAVE THEIR FILL OF PARLIAMENTARY PROSECUTIONS IN A SPEECH TO THE PARLIAMENT HE ENDEAVORED TO APOLOGIZE FOR MIDDLESEX AND TO SOFTEN THE ACCUSATION AGAINST HIM
8015-112690-0061 THE CHARGE HOWEVER WAS STILL MAINTAINED BY THE COMMONS AND THE TREASURER WAS FOUND GUILTY BY THE PEERS THOUGH THE MISDEMEANORS PROVED AGAINST HIM WERE NEITHER NUMEROUS NOR IMPORTANT
8015-112690-0062 THE ACCEPTING OF TWO PRESENTS OF FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS APIECE FOR PASSING TWO PATENTS WAS THE ARTICLE OF GREATEST WEIGHT HIS SENTENCE WAS TO BE FINED FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS FOR THE KING'S USE AND TO SUFFER ALL THE OTHER PENALTIES FORMERLY INFLICTED UPON BACON
8015-112690-0063 THIS SESSION AN ADDRESS WAS ALSO MADE VERY DISAGREEABLE TO THE KING CRAVING THE SEVERE EXECUTION OF THE LAWS AGAINST CATHOLICS HIS ANSWER WAS GRACIOUS AND CONDESCENDING
8015-112690-0064 THOUGH HE DECLARED AGAINST PERSECUTION AS BEING AN IMPROPER MEASURE FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF ANY RELIGION ACCORDING TO THE RECEIVED MAXIM THAT THE BLOOD OF THE MARTYRS WAS THE SEED OF THE CHURCH HE ALSO CONDEMNED AN ENTIRE INDULGENCE OF THE CATHOLICS
8015-112690-0065 AND SEEMED TO REPRESENT A MIDDLE COURSE AS THE MOST HUMANE AND MOST POLITIC HE WENT SO FAR AS EVEN TO AFFIRM WITH AN OATH THAT HE NEVER HAD ENTERTAINED ANY THOUGHTS OF GRANTING A TOLERATION TO THESE RELIGIONISTS
8015-112690-0066 THE LIBERTY OF EXERCISING THEIR WORSHIP IN PRIVATE HOUSES WHICH HE HAD SECRETLY AGREED TO IN THE SPANISH TREATY DID NOT APPEAR TO HIM DESERVING THAT NAME AND IT WAS PROBABLY BY MEANS OF THIS EXPLICATION HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD SAVED HIS HONOR
8015-112690-0067 WHICH HE DISTINGUISHED FROM A TOLERATION
