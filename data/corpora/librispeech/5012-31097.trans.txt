5012-31097-0000 IT SET IN MOTION MANY SHADOWS WHICH HAD THEIR HOME IN THE CORNERS OF THE WALLS AND BADE THEM CEASE THEIR SULLENNESS AND COME FORTH TO DANCE IN THE RIOT OF THE HOUR AND SO EACH SHADOW FOUND ITS PARTNER IN A RAY OF FIRELIGHT AND THERE THEY DANCED
5012-31097-0001 THEY CROSSED THE GRINNING SKULL OF THE GRAY WOLF THEY SOFTENED THE EYES OF THE ANTELOPE'S HEAD AND MADE DARK LINES BEHIND THE LONG TINED ANTLERS OF THE ELK AND OF THE DEER
5012-31097-0002 THEY BROUGHT FORTH TO VIEW IN ALTERNATE ECLIPSE AND DEFINITION THE GREAT GRIM BEAR'S HEAD WHICH HUNG ABOVE THE MANTEL EVERY TROPHY GATHERED IN YEARS OF THE CHASE ONCE PERHAPS PRIZED NOW PERHAPS FORGOTTEN
5012-31097-0003 WAS BROUGHT INTO EVIDENCE NOR COULD ONE ESCAPE NOTING EACH ONE AND GIVING TO EACH FOR THIS ONE NIGHT MORE THE STORY WHICH BELONGED TO IT I SAT AND LOOKED UPON THEM ALL AND SO THERE PASSED A PANORAMA OF THE YEARS
5012-31097-0004 THERE THOUGHT I IS THE STAG WHICH ONCE FELL FAR IN THE PINE WOODS OF THE NORTH THIS ANTELOPE TAKES ME BACK TO THE HARD WHITE PLAINS THESE HUGE ANTLERS COULD GROW ONLY AMID THE FORESTS OF THE ROCKIES THAT WOLF
5012-31097-0005 HOW MANY OF THE HOUNDS HE MANGLED I REMEMBER AND THE GIANT BEAR IT WAS A GOOD FIGHT HE MADE PERHAPS DANGEROUS HAD THE OLD RIFLE THERE BEEN LESS SURE YES YES OF COURSE I COULD RECALL EACH INCIDENT
5012-31097-0006 THE MOUTH MUST HAVE BEEN DRY WITH THE ARDOR OF THE CHASE AT THOSE TIMES BUT NOW BUT WHY DOES THE HEART LEAP TO NIGHT DO THE VEINS FILL WITH THE RUSH OF THE BLOOD TUMULTUOUS IN THE JOY OF STIMULUS OR DANGER
5012-31097-0007 WHICH UNKNOWN TO ME HAD COME AND PLACED ITSELF UPON THE TABLE I KNOW AND IT CLIMBED UPON MY ARM WHICH LAY ACROSS THE TABLE
5012-31097-0008 THE FIRE SHONE FAIR UPON ITS LITTLE FORM SO THAT IN SILHOUETTE ITS OUTLINE WAS DELICATE AND KEEN AS AN IMAGE CUT FROM THE FIERY HEART OF A NOBLE OPAL STONE AND WHAT IS IT THAT YOU KNOW I ASKED MAKER OF DREAMS TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW TO NIGHT
5012-31097-0009 THE SINGING MOUSE BALANCED AND MOVED ITSELF IN HARMONY WITH THE BEAT OF THE FIRE'S RAYS I LOOKED AT IT SO CLOSELY THAT A DREAM CAME UPON MY EYES SO THAT THE VOICE OF THE SINGING MOUSE SOUNDED FAR AWAY AND FAINT
5012-31097-0010 THOUGH IT WAS STILL CLEAR AND RESONANT IN ITS OWN PECULIAR WAY AND VERY FINE AND SWEET I WILL TELL YOU WHICH TROPHY YOU MOST PRIZE IT SAID I WILL SHOW YOU YOUR ILIAD OF THE CHASE DO YOU NOT REMEMBER
5012-31097-0011 AND SO I GAZED WHERE THE SINGING MOUSE POINTED QUITE BEYOND THE DUSTY WALLS AND THERE I SAW AS IT HAD SAID I HEARD NOT THE THUNDER OF THE HOOFS OF BUFFALO NOR THE FAINT CRACK OF THE TWIG BENEATH THE PANTHER'S FOOT
5012-31097-0012 I SAW NOT THE LURCHING GALLOP OF THE LONG JAWED WOLF NOR THE HIGH ELASTIC BOUNDING OF THE DEER THE LEVEL SWINGING SPEED OF THE ANTELOPE THE SLINKING OF THE LYNX THE CRASHING FLIGHT OF THE WAPITI
5012-31097-0013 NO IT WAS NONE OF THESE THAT CAME TO MIND NOR DID THE MOUNTAINS NOR THE PLAINS NOR THE WILDERNESS OF THE PINES BUT WHEN THE SINGING MOUSE WHISPERED DO YOU SEE I MURMURED IN REPLY I SEE IT ALL AGAIN
5012-31097-0014 I SAW THE SMALL LOW HILLS WELL COVERED WITH SHORT OAKS AND HAZEL BUSHES WHICH ROLLED ON AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE FAR OUT ALMOST TO THE DELECTABLE MOUNTAINS WHICH ARE WELL KNOWN TO BE UPON THE EDGE OF THE WORLD
5012-31097-0015 THROUGH THESE LOW HILLS A WINDING ROAD LED ON A ROAD WHOSE END NO MAN HAD EVER REACHED BUT WHICH WENT TO PLACES WHERE NO DOUBT MANY WONDERS WERE
5012-31097-0016 FOR SO A WISE MAN ONCE HAD SAID HIS WORDS HARKENED TO WITH AWE THIS WAS A PLEASANT ROAD LINED WITH BRAVE SUMACS WITH BUSHES OF THE WILD BLACKBERRY
5012-31097-0017 AND WITH SMALL HAZEL TREES WHICH SOON WOULD OFFER FRUIT FOR THE REGULAR HARVEST OF THE FALL THIS SAME TO BE SPREAD FOR DRYING ON THE WOODSHED ROOF IT WAS PERHAPS WISE CURIOSITY AS TO THE CROP OF NUTS WHICH HAD BROUGHT THUS FAR FROM HOME THESE TWO FIGURES
5012-31097-0018 AN ENORMOUS DISTANCE PERHAPS AT LEAST A MILE BEYOND WHAT HERETOFORE HAD BEEN THE UTMOST LIMIT OF THEIR WANDERINGS IT WAS NOT PERHAPS SAFE TO VENTURE SO FAR THERE WERE KNOWN TO BE STRANGE CREATURES IN THESE WOODS
5012-31097-0019 ONE KNEW NOT WHAT IT WAS THEREFORE WELL THAT THE YOUNGER BOY SHOULD CLASP TIGHTLY THE HAND OF THE OLDER HIM WHO BORE WITH SUCH CONFIDENCE THE BOW AND ARROWS
5012-31097-0020 ALONG THIS MYSTERIOUS ROAD THROUGH THIS WILD AND UNKNOWN WILDERNESS SO FAR FROM ANY HABITATION OF MANKIND THE ZEAL OF THE EXPLORER HELD THEM FAST THEY SCARCE DARED FARE FARTHER ON BUT YET WOULD NOT TURN BACK
5012-31097-0021 THE NOISES OF THE WOODS THRILLED THEM THE SUDDEN CLANGING NOTE OF THE JAY NEAR BY CAUSED THEM TO STOP HEART IN MOUTH FOR THE MOMENT STRANGE RUSTLINGS IN THE LEAVES MADE THEM CROSS THE ROAD AND STEP MORE QUICKLY
5012-31097-0022 YET THE CAWING OF A CROW ACROSS THE WOODS SEEMED FRIENDLY AND A SMALL BROWN BIRD WHICH HOPPED AHEAD ALONG THE ROAD WAS INTIMATE AND KIND AND THUS TOUCHED THE FOUNTS OF BRAVERY IN THE TWO VENTUROUS HEARTS CERTAINLY THEY WOULD GO ON
5012-31097-0023 IT WAS NO MATTER ABOUT THE SUN THIS WAS THE VALLEY OF AJALON PERHAPS OF WHICH ONE HAD HEARD IN THE CLASS AT SABBATH SCHOOL AND SURELY THIS WAS A GOOD DRONING YELLOW BODIED BEE
5012-31097-0024 WHERE DID THE BEES GO TO WHEN THEY ROSE UP STRAIGHT INTO THE AIR AND THIS LITTLE MOUSE WHAT BECAME OF IT IN WINTER AND AH WHAT WAS THAT THAT AWFUL BURST OF SOUND
5012-31097-0025 CLUTCH CLOSER LITTLE BROTHER THOUGH BOTH BE PALE HOW SHOULD EITHER OF YOU YET KNOW THE THUNDEROUS FLIGHT OF THE WILD GROUSE THIS GREAT BIRD WHICH WHIRLED AWAY THROUGH THE BROWN LEAVES OF THE OAKS
5012-31097-0026 FATHER MUST BE ASKED ABOUT THIS TREMENDOUS STARTLING BIRD MEANTIME THE HEART HAVING BEGUN TO BEAT AGAIN LET THE TWO ADVENTURERS PRESS YET A LITTLE FARTHER ON AND SO WITH FEARS AND TREMBLINGS WITH DOUBTS AND JOYS
5012-31097-0027 THROUGH BRIERS AND FLOWERS THROUGH HINDRANCES AND RECOMPENSES ALONG THIS CROOKED WINDING UNKNOWN ROAD WHICH LED ON OUT INTO THE UNKNOWN THEY WANDERED
5012-31097-0028 WHAT IS IT THIS SOUND APPROACHING COMING DIRECTLY TOWARD THE ROAD SURELY IT MUST BE THE FOOTFALL OF SOME LARGE ANIMAL THIS CADENCED RUSTLING ON THE LEAVES IT COMES IT WILL CROSS NEAR
5012-31097-0029 THERE IT HAS TURNED IT IS NEAR THE ROAD LOOK THERE IT IS A GREAT ANIMAL HALF THE LENGTH OF ONE'S ARM WITH BUSHY LONG RED TAIL ARCHED HIGH FOR EASIER RUNNING ITS GRAYISH COAT SHOWING IN THE BARS OF SUNLIGHT
5012-31097-0030 ITS EYES BRIGHT AND BLACK AND KEEN HAD IT NOT BEEN SAID THERE WERE WILD ANIMALS IN THESE WOODS EACH HEART NOW THUMPED HARD WITH THE SURGING BLOOD IT BORE
5012-31097-0031 FEAR VANISHED AT THE SIGHT OF THE QUARRY AND THE ONLY THOUGHT REMAINING WAS THAT OF BATTLE AND OF VICTORY WELL FOR THE ANIMAL THAT IT RAN ILL FOR IT THAT IT RAN DOWN THE ROAD AND NOT BACK INTO THE COVER
5012-31097-0032 BUT HO THE CREATURE RALLIES RECOVERS IT GATHERS ITS FORCES IT FLIES PURSUIT THEN BUT PURSUIT APPARENTLY USELESS FOR THE ANIMAL HAS FOUND REFUGE DEEP IN THIS HOLLOW STUMP BEYOND THE REACH OF LONGEST MORTAL ARM
5012-31097-0033 RUSTLE NOW YE LEAVES AND THREATEN NOW ALL YE BOUGHS WITH MENACINGS
5012-31097-0034 NO LONGER CAN YE STRIKE TERROR INTO THESE TWO SOULS SMALL THOUGH THEY BE THE HEART OF THE HUNTER HAS NOW BEEN BORN FOR EACH FEAR AND DEFEAT ARE KNOWN NO LONGER IN THE COMPASS OF THEIR THOUGHTS FOLLOW FOLLOW FOLLOW
5012-31097-0035 SO SPAKE THE GOOD OLD SAVAGERY OF THE NATURAL MAN BETTER FOR THIS CREATURE HAD IT NEVER DISTURBED THESE TWO WITH ITS FOOTFALLS APPROACHING AMONG THE LEAVES OUT OF ITS REFUGE NOW MUST IT COME YEA THOUGH ONE LOST A THOUSAND SUPPERS THAT NIGHT
5012-31097-0036 AND THOUGH A THOUSAND STONES LAY WAITING IN THE DARK ALONG THE ROAD TO HURT BARE UNPROTECTED TOES THE SUN FORGOT ITS PART AND SANK RED THOUGH RELUCTANT BEYOND THE DELECTABLE MOUNTAINS THOU MOON THIS IS AJALON
5012-31097-0037 BE KINDLY FOR BY MOONLIGHT ONE STILL MAY LABOR AND HERE IS LABOR TO BE DONE EVERY BLADE IN THE BARLOW KNIVES IS BROKEN THE HOLE IN THE STUMP YIELDS NOT TO SLASHINGS NOR TO ATTEMPTS TO PRY IT OPEN
5012-31097-0038 THE PREY IS STILL UNREACHED WHAT IS TO BE DONE THE ELDER HUNTER BETHINKS HIM OF A SOLUTION FOR THIS PROBLEM THE BROKEN BLADE WILL DO TO GNAW OFF THIS BOUGH AND IT WILL SERVE TO MAKE A SPLIT IN THE END OF IT
5012-31097-0039 AND IF ONE BE FORTUNATE AND IF THIS SPLIT BESTRIDE THE TAIL OF THE CONCEALED ANIMAL AND IF THE STICK BE TWISTED I'VE GOT HIM CRIED THIS PHILOSOPHER FOR HIS EUREKA AND THEN THERE WAS TWISTING AND PULLING AND SCRATCHING AND SQUEAKING
5012-31097-0040 AND BITTEN FINGERS AND TEARS BUT AFTER ALL WAS OVER THERE LAY THE SQUIRREL VANQUISHED AT THE FEET OF THESE YOUNG BARBARIANS WHO HAD WANDERED OUT FROM HOME INTO THE UNKNOWN LANDS OF EARTH CRUEL BARBARIANS THOUGHTLESS RELENTLESS
5012-31097-0041 MARCHED UP INTO THE DOORYARD BEARING ON A POLE BETWEEN THEM THEIR QUARRY WELL SUSPENDED BY THE GAMBRELS MY BOYS I FEARED THAT YOU WERE LOST EXCLAIMS THE TEARFUL MOTHER WHO STANDS WAITING IN THE DOOR
5012-31097-0042 BUT THE SILENT FATHER STANDING BACK OF HER IN THE GLOW OF THE LAMPLIGHT SEES WHAT THE POLE IS BEARING AND IN HIS EYE THERE IS A SMILE AFTER THAT MOTHERLY REPROACH FATHERLY INQUIRY PLENTEOUS BREAD AND MILK
5012-31097-0043 MANY EAGER EXPLANATIONS AND MUCH DESCRIPTIVE NARRATIVE SIMULTANEOUSLY UTTERED BY TWO MOUTHS EAGER BOTH TO EAT AND TO TALK I SEE IT ALL I SAID TO THE SINGING MOUSE IT ALL COMES BACK AGAIN
5012-31097-0044 NO CHASE WAS EVER OR WILL EVER BE SO GREAT AS THIS ONE BACK THERE NEAR THE DELECTABLE MOUNTAINS IN THOSE DAYS GONE BY THOSE INCOMPARABLE DAYS OF YOUTH
