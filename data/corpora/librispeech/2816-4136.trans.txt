2816-4136-0000 WITH THE GROWING POPULATION OF SLAVES IN THE SOUTHERN STATES OF AMERICA THERE IS A FEARFUL INCREASE OF HALF WHITES MOST OF WHOSE FATHERS ARE SLAVEOWNERS AND THEIR MOTHERS SLAVES SOCIETY DOES NOT FROWN UPON THE MAN WHO SITS WITH HIS MULATTO CHILD UPON HIS KNEE
2816-4136-0001 WHILST ITS MOTHER STANDS A SLAVE BEHIND HIS CHAIR THE LATE HENRY CLAY SOME YEARS SINCE PREDICTED THAT THE ABOLITION OF NEGRO SLAVERY WOULD BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE AMALGAMATION OF THE RACES JOHN RANDOLPH A DISTINGUISHED SLAVEHOLDER OF VIRGINIA AND A PROMINENT STATESMAN
2816-4136-0002 SAID IN A SPEECH IN THE LEGISLATURE OF HIS NATIVE STATE THAT THE BLOOD OF THE FIRST AMERICAN STATESMEN COURSED THROUGH THE VEINS OF THE SLAVE OF THE SOUTH IN ALL THE CITIES AND TOWNS OF THE SLAVE STATES THE REAL NEGRO OR CLEAR BLACK
2816-4136-0003 DOES NOT AMOUNT TO MORE THAN ONE IN EVERY FOUR OF THE SLAVE POPULATION THIS FACT IS OF ITSELF THE BEST EVIDENCE OF THE DEGRADED AND IMMORAL CONDITION OF THE RELATION OF MASTER AND SLAVE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
2816-4136-0004 IN ALL THE SLAVE STATES THE LAW SAYS SLAVES SHALL BE DEEMED SOLD HELD TAKEN REPUTED AND ADJUDGED IN LAW TO BE CHATTELS PERSONAL IN THE HANDS OF THEIR OWNERS AND POSSESSORS
2816-4136-0005 AND THEIR EXECUTORS ADMINISTRATORS AND ASSIGNS TO ALL INTENTS CONSTRUCTIONS AND PURPOSES WHATSOEVER A SLAVE IS ONE WHO IS IN THE POWER OF A MASTER TO WHOM HE BELONGS THE MASTER MAY SELL HIM
2816-4136-0006 DISPOSE OF HIS PERSON HIS INDUSTRY AND HIS LABOUR HE CAN DO NOTHING POSSESS NOTHING NOR ACQUIRE ANYTHING BUT WHAT MUST BELONG TO HIS MASTER THE SLAVE IS ENTIRELY SUBJECT TO THE WILL OF HIS MASTER
2816-4136-0007 WHO MAY CORRECT AND CHASTISE HIM THOUGH NOT WITH UNUSUAL RIGOUR OR SO AS TO MAIM AND MUTILATE HIM OR EXPOSE HIM TO THE DANGER OF LOSS OF LIFE OR TO CAUSE HIS DEATH THE SLAVE TO REMAIN A SLAVE MUST BE SENSIBLE THAT THERE IS NO APPEAL FROM HIS MASTER
2816-4136-0008 WHERE THE SLAVE IS PLACED BY LAW ENTIRELY UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE MAN WHO CLAIMS HIM BODY AND SOUL AS PROPERTY WHAT ELSE COULD BE EXPECTED THAN THE MOST DEPRAVED SOCIAL CONDITION
2816-4136-0009 THE MARRIAGE RELATION THE OLDEST AND MOST SACRED INSTITUTION GIVEN TO MAN BY HIS CREATOR IS UNKNOWN AND UNRECOGNISED IN THE SLAVE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD THAT WE COULD SAY THAT THE MORAL AND RELIGIOUS TEACHING IN THE SLAVE STATES WERE BETTER THAN THE LAWS
2816-4136-0010 BUT ALAS WE CANNOT A FEW YEARS SINCE SOME SLAVEHOLDERS BECAME A LITTLE UNEASY IN THEIR MINDS ABOUT THE RIGHTFULNESS OF PERMITTING SLAVES TO TAKE TO THEMSELVES HUSBANDS AND WIVES WHILE THEY STILL HAD OTHERS LIVING AND APPLIED TO THEIR RELIGIOUS TEACHERS FOR ADVICE
2816-4136-0011 AND THE FOLLOWING WILL SHOW HOW THIS GRAVE AND IMPORTANT SUBJECT WAS TREATED IS A SERVANT WHOSE HUSBAND OR WIFE HAS BEEN SOLD BY HIS OR HER MASTER INTO A DISTANT COUNTRY TO BE PERMITTED TO MARRY AGAIN THE QUERY WAS REFERRED TO A COMMITTEE WHO MADE THE FOLLOWING REPORT
2816-4136-0012 WHICH AFTER DISCUSSION WAS ADOPTED THAT IN VIEW OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH SERVANTS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE PLACED THE COMMITTEE ARE UNANIMOUS IN THE OPINION THAT IT IS BETTER TO PERMIT SERVANTS THUS CIRCUMSTANCED TO TAKE ANOTHER HUSBAND OR WIFE
2816-4136-0013 SUCH WAS THE ANSWER FROM A COMMITTEE OF THE SHILOH BAPTIST ASSOCIATION AND INSTEAD OF RECEIVING LIGHT THOSE WHO ASKED THE QUESTION WERE PLUNGED INTO DEEPER DARKNESS A SIMILAR QUESTION WAS PUT TO THE SAVANNAH RIVER ASSOCIATION
2816-4136-0014 AND THE ANSWER AS THE FOLLOWING WILL SHOW DID NOT MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM THE ONE WE HAVE ALREADY GIVEN WHETHER IN A CASE OF INVOLUNTARY SEPARATION OF SUCH A CHARACTER AS TO PRECLUDE ALL PROSPECT OF FUTURE INTERCOURSE THE PARTIES OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED TO MARRY AGAIN
2816-4136-0015 TO FORBID SECOND MARRIAGES IN SUCH CASES WOULD BE TO EXPOSE THE PARTIES NOT ONLY TO STRONGER HARDSHIPS AND STRONG TEMPTATION BUT TO CHURCH CENSURE FOR ACTING IN OBEDIENCE TO THEIR MASTERS WHO CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO ACQUIESCE IN A REGULATION AT VARIANCE WITH JUSTICE TO THE SLAVES
2816-4136-0016 ALTHOUGH MARRIAGE AS THE ABOVE INDICATES IS A MATTER WHICH THE SLAVEHOLDERS DO NOT THINK IS OF ANY IMPORTANCE OR OF ANY BINDING FORCE WITH THEIR SLAVES YET IT WOULD BE DOING THAT DEGRADED CLASS AN INJUSTICE NOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MANY OF THEM DO REGARD IT AS A SACRED OBLIGATION
2816-4136-0017 AND SHOW A WILLINGNESS TO OBEY THE COMMANDS OF GOD ON THIS SUBJECT MARRIAGE IS INDEED THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT INSTITUTION OF HUMAN EXISTENCE THE FOUNDATION OF ALL CIVILISATION AND CULTURE THE ROOT OF CHURCH AND STATE
2816-4136-0018 IT IS THE MOST INTIMATE COVENANT OF HEART FORMED AMONG MANKIND AND FOR MANY PERSONS THE ONLY RELATION IN WHICH THEY FEEL THE TRUE SENTIMENTS OF HUMANITY IT GIVES SCOPE FOR EVERY HUMAN VIRTUE SINCE EACH OF THESE IS DEVELOPED FROM THE LOVE AND CONFIDENCE WHICH HERE PREDOMINATE
2816-4136-0019 IT UNITES ALL WHICH ENNOBLES AND BEAUTIFIES LIFE SYMPATHY KINDNESS OF WILL AND DEED GRATITUDE DEVOTION AND EVERY DELICATE INTIMATE FEELING AS THE ONLY ASYLUM FOR TRUE EDUCATION IT IS THE FIRST AND LAST SANCTUARY OF HUMAN CULTURE
2816-4136-0020 AS HUSBAND AND WIFE THROUGH EACH OTHER BECOME CONSCIOUS OF COMPLETE HUMANITY AND EVERY HUMAN FEELING AND EVERY HUMAN VIRTUE SO CHILDREN AT THEIR FIRST AWAKENING IN THE FOND COVENANT OF LOVE BETWEEN PARENTS BOTH OF WHOM ARE TENDERLY CONCERNED FOR THE SAME OBJECT
2816-4136-0021 FIND AN IMAGE OF COMPLETE HUMANITY LEAGUED IN FREE LOVE THE SPIRIT OF LOVE WHICH PREVAILS BETWEEN THEM ACTS WITH CREATIVE POWER UPON THE YOUNG MIND AND AWAKENS EVERY GERM OF GOODNESS WITHIN IT
2816-4136-0022 THIS INVISIBLE AND INCALCULABLE INFLUENCE OF PARENTAL LIFE ACTS MORE UPON THE CHILD THAN ALL THE EFFORTS OF EDUCATION WHETHER BY MEANS OF INSTRUCTION PRECEPT OR EXHORTATION
2816-4136-0023 SUCH IS THE INFLUENCE OF SLAVERY IN THE UNITED STATES THAT THE MINISTERS OF RELIGION EVEN IN THE SO CALLED FREE STATES ARE THE MERE ECHOES INSTEAD OF THE CORRECTORS OF PUBLIC SENTIMENT
2816-4136-0024 WE HAVE THOUGHT IT ADVISABLE TO SHOW THAT THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CHATTEL SLAVERY IN AMERICA UNDERMINES THE ENTIRE SOCIAL CONDITION OF MAN SO AS TO PREPARE THE READER FOR THE FOLLOWING NARRATIVE OF SLAVE LIFE IN THAT OTHERWISE HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS COUNTRY
2816-4136-0025 IN ALL THE LARGE TOWNS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES THERE IS A CLASS OF SLAVES WHO ARE PERMITTED TO HIRE THEIR TIME OF THEIR OWNERS AND FOR WHICH THEY PAY A HIGH PRICE THESE ARE MULATTO WOMEN OR QUADROONS AS THEY ARE FAMILIARLY KNOWN
2816-4136-0026 AND ARE DISTINGUISHED FOR THEIR FASCINATING BEAUTY THE HANDSOMEST USUALLY PAYS THE HIGHEST PRICE FOR HER TIME MANY OF THESE WOMEN ARE THE FAVOURITES OF PERSONS WHO FURNISH THEM WITH THE MEANS OF PAYING THEIR OWNERS AND NOT A FEW ARE DRESSED IN THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT MANNER
2816-4136-0027 READER WHEN YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT AMONGST THE SLAVE POPULATION NO SAFEGUARD IS THROWN AROUND VIRTUE AND NO INDUCEMENT HELD OUT TO SLAVE WOMEN TO BE CHASTE YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED WHEN WE TELL YOU THAT IMMORALITY AND VICE PERVADE THE CITIES OF THE SOUTHERN STATES
2816-4136-0028 IN A MANNER UNKNOWN IN THE CITIES AND TOWNS OF THE NORTHERN STATES INDEED MOST OF THE SLAVE WOMEN HAVE NO HIGHER ASPIRATION THAN THAT OF BECOMING THE FINELY DRESSED MISTRESS OF SOME WHITE MAN AND AT NEGRO BALLS AND PARTIES THIS CLASS OF WOMEN USUALLY CUT THE GREATEST FIGURE
2816-4136-0029 AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR THE FOLLOWING ADVERTISEMENT APPEARED IN A NEWSPAPER PUBLISHED IN RICHMOND THE CAPITAL OF THE STATE OF VIRGINIA NOTICE THIRTY EIGHT NEGROES WILL BE OFFERED FOR SALE ON MONDAY NOVEMBER TENTH AT TWELVE O'CLOCK

2816-4136-0035 JEFFERSON BEING CALLED TO WASHINGTON TO FILL A GOVERNMENT APPOINTMENT CURRER WAS LEFT BEHIND AND THUS SHE TOOK HERSELF TO THE BUSINESS OF WASHING BY WHICH MEANS SHE PAID HER MASTER MISTER GRAVES AND SUPPORTED HERSELF AND TWO CHILDREN

2816-4136-0042 THAT HORATIO GREEN WAS SEATED IN THE SMALL GARDEN BEHIND CURRER'S COTTAGE

2816-4136-0050 CLOTEL WAS THE LAST AND AS WAS EXPECTED COMMANDED A HIGHER PRICE THAN ANY THAT HAD BEEN OFFERED FOR SALE THAT DAY THE APPEARANCE OF CLOTEL ON THE AUCTION BLOCK CREATED A DEEP SENSATION AMONGST THE CROWD
