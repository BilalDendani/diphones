846-130984-0000 FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL SATURDAY NOVEMBER TWENTY FOURTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
846-130984-0001 COMMANDED THE MOST GENERAL ASSENT OF MEN WHO HAVE ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SUBJECT THIS APPLIES AS WELL TO OUR INTERCOURSE WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES AS WITH EACH OTHER
846-130984-0002 THERE ARE APPEARANCES TO AUTHORIZE A SUPPOSITION THAT THE ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT WHICH DISTINGUISHES THE COMMERCIAL CHARACTER OF AMERICA
846-130984-0003 HAS ALREADY EXCITED UNEASY SENSATIONS IN SEVERAL OF THE MARITIME POWERS OF EUROPE THEY SEEM TO BE APPREHENSIVE OF OUR TOO GREAT INTERFERENCE IN THAT CARRYING TRADE
846-130984-0004 FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF STATES WHICH HAVE ALL THE DISPOSITIONS AND WOULD POSSESS ALL THE MEANS REQUISITE TO THE CREATION OF A POWERFUL MARINE IMPRESSIONS OF THIS KIND
846-130984-0005 WILL NATURALLY INDICATE THE POLICY OF FOSTERING DIVISIONS AMONG US AND OF DEPRIVING US AS FAR AS POSSIBLE OF AN ACTIVE COMMERCE IN OUR OWN BOTTOMS THIS WOULD ANSWER THE THREEFOLD PURPOSE
846-130984-0006 OF PREVENTING OUR INTERFERENCE IN THEIR NAVIGATION OF MONOPOLIZING THE PROFITS OF OUR TRADE AND OF CLIPPING THE WINGS BY WHICH WE MIGHT SOAR TO A DANGEROUS GREATNESS
846-130984-0007 DID NOT PRUDENCE FORBID THE DETAIL IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO TRACE BY FACTS THE WORKINGS OF THIS POLICY TO THE CABINETS OF MINISTERS IF WE CONTINUE UNITED
846-130984-0008 WE MAY COUNTERACT A POLICY SO UNFRIENDLY TO OUR PROSPERITY IN A VARIETY OF WAYS BY PROHIBITORY REGULATIONS EXTENDING AT THE SAME TIME THROUGHOUT THE STATES
846-130984-0009 OUR MARKETS THIS ASSERTION WILL NOT APPEAR CHIMERICAL TO THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MARKETS OF THREE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
846-130984-0010 AND THE IMMENSE DIFFERENCE THERE WOULD BE TO THE TRADE AND NAVIGATION OF SUCH A NATION BETWEEN A DIRECT COMMUNICATION IN ITS OWN SHIPS AND AN INDIRECT CONVEYANCE OF ITS PRODUCTS AND RETURNS TO AND FROM AMERICA IN THE SHIPS
846-130984-0011 FROM ALL OUR PORTS WHAT WOULD BE THE PROBABLE OPERATION OF THIS STEP UPON HER POLITICS WOULD IT NOT ENABLE US TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE FAIREST PROSPECT OF SUCCESS
846-130984-0012 FOR COMMERCIAL PRIVILEGES OF THE MOST VALUABLE AND EXTENSIVE KIND IN THE DOMINIONS OF THAT KINGDOM WHEN THESE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED UPON OTHER OCCASIONS THEY HAVE RECEIVED A PLAUSIBLE
846-130984-0013 BY THE LOSS OF THE IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE OF BEING HER OWN CARRIER IN THAT TRADE WOULD NOT THE PRINCIPAL PART OF ITS PROFITS BE INTERCEPTED BY THE DUTCH AS A COMPENSATION FOR THEIR AGENCY AND RISK
846-130984-0014 WOULD NOT THE MERE CIRCUMSTANCE OF FREIGHT OCCASION A CONSIDERABLE DEDUCTION WOULD NOT SO CIRCUITOUS AN INTERCOURSE FACILITATE THE COMPETITIONS OF OTHER NATIONS BY ENHANCING THE PRICE OF BRITISH COMMODITIES IN OUR MARKETS
846-130984-0015 AND BY TRANSFERRING TO OTHER HANDS THE MANAGEMENT OF THIS INTERESTING BRANCH OF THE BRITISH COMMERCE A MATURE CONSIDERATION OF THE OBJECTS SUGGESTED BY THESE QUESTIONS WILL JUSTIFY A BELIEF
846-130984-0016 THAT THE REAL DISADVANTAGES TO BRITAIN FROM SUCH A STATE OF THINGS CONSPIRING WITH THE PRE POSSESSIONS OF A GREAT PART OF THE NATION IN FAVOR OF THE AMERICAN TRADE AND WITH THE IMPORTUNITIES OF THE WEST INDIA ISLANDS
846-130984-0017 SUCH A POINT GAINED FROM THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND WHICH COULD NOT BE EXPECTED WITHOUT AN EQUIVALENT IN EXEMPTIONS AND IMMUNITIES IN OUR MARKETS
846-130984-0018 ON THE CONDUCT OF OTHER NATIONS WHO WOULD NOT BE INCLINED TO SEE THEMSELVES ALTOGETHER SUPPLANTED IN OUR TRADE A FURTHER RESOURCE FOR INFLUENCING THE CONDUCT OF EUROPEAN NATIONS TOWARD US IN THIS RESPECT
846-130984-0019 WOULD ARISE FROM THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A FEDERAL NAVY THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE CONTINUANCE OF THE UNION UNDER AN EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT WOULD PUT IT IN OUR POWER
846-130984-0020 AT A PERIOD NOT VERY DISTANT TO CREATE A NAVY WHICH IF IT COULD NOT VIE WITH THOSE OF THE GREAT MARITIME POWERS WOULD AT LEAST BE OF RESPECTABLE WEIGHT IF THROWN INTO THE SCALE OF
846-130984-0021 THIS WOULD BE MORE PECULIARLY THE CASE IN RELATION TO OPERATIONS IN THE WEST INDIES A FEW SHIPS OF THE LINE SENT OPPORTUNELY TO THE REINFORCEMENT OF EITHER SIDE
846-130984-0022 WOULD OFTEN BE SUFFICIENT TO DECIDE THE FATE OF A CAMPAIGN ON THE EVENT OF WHICH INTERESTS OF THE GREATEST MAGNITUDE WERE SUSPENDED OUR POSITION IS IN THIS RESPECT A MOST COMMANDING ONE
846-130984-0023 WOULD ENABLE US TO BARGAIN WITH GREAT ADVANTAGE FOR COMMERCIAL PRIVILEGES A PRICE WOULD BE SET NOT ONLY UPON OUR FRIENDSHIP BUT UPON OUR NEUTRALITY BY A STEADY ADHERENCE TO THE UNION WE MAY HOPE ERELONG
846-130984-0024 TO BECOME THE ARBITER OF EUROPE IN AMERICA AND TO BE ABLE TO INCLINE THE BALANCE OF
846-130984-0025 WHO HAVING NOTHING TO FEAR FROM US WOULD WITH LITTLE SCRUPLE OR REMORSE SUPPLY THEIR WANTS
846-130984-0026 WILL ONLY BE RESPECTED WHEN THEY ARE DEFENDED BY AN ADEQUATE POWER A NATION DESPICABLE BY ITS WEAKNESS FORFEITS EVEN THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING NEUTRAL UNDER A VIGOROUS NATIONAL GOVERNMENT
846-130984-0027 WE MIGHT DEFY THE LITTLE ARTS OF THE LITTLE POLITICIANS TO CONTROL OR VARY THE IRRESISTIBLE AND UNCHANGEABLE COURSE OF NATURE BUT IN A STATE OF DISUNION
846-130984-0028 THESE COMBINATIONS MIGHT EXIST AND MIGHT OPERATE WITH SUCCESS IT WOULD BE IN THE POWER OF THE MARITIME NATIONS AVAILING THEMSELVES OF OUR UNIVERSAL IMPOTENCE
846-130984-0029 THEY WOULD IN ALL PROBABILITY COMBINE TO EMBARRASS OUR NAVIGATION IN SUCH A MANNER AS WOULD IN EFFECT DESTROY IT AND CONFINE US TO A PASSIVE COMMERCE
846-130984-0030 WOULD BE STIFLED AND LOST AND POVERTY AND DISGRACE WOULD OVERSPREAD A COUNTRY WHICH WITH WISDOM MIGHT MAKE HERSELF THE ADMIRATION AND ENVY OF THE WORLD
846-130984-0031 THERE ARE RIGHTS OF GREAT MOMENT TO THE TRADE OF AMERICA WHICH ARE RIGHTS OF THE UNION I ALLUDE TO THE FISHERIES TO THE NAVIGATION OF THE WESTERN LAKES AND TO THAT OF THE MISSISSIPPI
846-130984-0032 THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CONFEDERACY WOULD GIVE ROOM FOR DELICATE QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE FUTURE EXISTENCE OF THESE RIGHTS WHICH THE INTEREST OF MORE POWERFUL PARTNERS WOULD HARDLY FAIL TO SOLVE TO OUR DISADVANTAGE
846-130984-0033 THEY OF COURSE WOULD HARDLY REMAIN LONG INDIFFERENT TO THAT DECIDED MASTERY OF WHICH EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN US TO BE POSSESSED IN THIS VALUABLE BRANCH OF TRAFFIC
846-130984-0034 AND BY WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO UNDERSELL THOSE NATIONS IN THEIR OWN MARKETS WHAT MORE NATURAL THAN THAT THEY SHOULD BE DISPOSED TO EXCLUDE FROM THE LISTS SUCH DANGEROUS COMPETITORS THIS BRANCH OF TRADE
846-130984-0035 OUGHT NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS A PARTIAL BENEFIT ALL THE NAVIGATING STATES MAY IN DIFFERENT DEGREES ADVANTAGEOUSLY PARTICIPATE IN IT AND UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF A GREATER EXTENSION OF MERCANTILE CAPITAL
846-130984-0036 WOULD NOT BE UNLIKELY TO DO IT AS A NURSERY OF SEAMEN IT NOW IS OR WHEN TIME SHALL HAVE MORE NEARLY ASSIMILATED THE PRINCIPLES OF NAVIGATION IN THE SEVERAL STATES WILL BECOME
846-130984-0037 EVERY INSTITUTION WILL GROW AND FLOURISH IN PROPORTION TO THE QUANTITY AND EXTENT OF THE MEANS CONCENTRED TOWARDS ITS FORMATION AND SUPPORT A NAVY OF THE UNITED STATES AS IT WOULD EMBRACE THE RESOURCES OF ALL
846-130984-0038 IS AN OBJECT FAR LESS REMOTE THAN A NAVY OF ANY SINGLE STATE
846-130984-0039 WHICH WOULD ONLY EMBRACE THE RESOURCES OF A SINGLE PART IT HAPPENS INDEED THAT DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF CONFEDERATED AMERICA POSSESS EACH SOME PECULIAR ADVANTAGE FOR THIS ESSENTIAL ESTABLISHMENT
846-130984-0040 THE MORE SOUTHERN STATES FURNISH IN GREATER ABUNDANCE CERTAIN KINDS OF NAVAL STORES TAR PITCH AND TURPENTINE THEIR WOOD FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF SHIPS IS ALSO OF A MORE SOLID AND LASTING TEXTURE
846-130984-0041 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE DURATION OF THE SHIPS OF WHICH THE NAVY MIGHT BE COMPOSED IF CHIEFLY CONSTRUCTED OF SOUTHERN WOOD WOULD BE OF SIGNAL IMPORTANCE EITHER IN THE VIEW OF NAVAL STRENGTH OR OF NATIONAL ECONOMY
846-130984-0042 THE NECESSITY OF NAVAL PROTECTION TO EXTERNAL OR MARITIME COMMERCE DOES NOT REQUIRE A PARTICULAR ELUCIDATION NO MORE THAN THE CONDUCIVENESS OF THAT SPECIES OF COMMERCE TO THE PROSPERITY OF A NAVY
846-130984-0043 COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE WILL HAVE MUCH GREATER SCOPE FROM THE DIVERSITY IN THE PRODUCTIONS OF DIFFERENT STATES WHEN THE STAPLE OF ONE FAILS FROM A BAD HARVEST OR UNPRODUCTIVE CROP
846-130984-0044 IT CAN CALL TO ITS AID THE STAPLE OF ANOTHER THE VARIETY NOT LESS THAN THE VALUE OF PRODUCTS FOR EXPORTATION CONTRIBUTES TO THE ACTIVITY OF FOREIGN COMMERCE
846-130984-0045 IT CAN BE CONDUCTED UPON MUCH BETTER TERMS WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF MATERIALS OF A GIVEN VALUE THAN WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF MATERIALS OF THE SAME VALUE ARISING FROM THE COMPETITIONS OF TRADE AND FROM THE FLUCTUATIONS OF MARKETS
846-130984-0046 PARTICULAR ARTICLES MAY BE IN GREAT DEMAND AT CERTAIN PERIODS AND UNSALABLE AT OTHERS BUT IF THERE BE A VARIETY OF ARTICLES
846-130984-0047 THAT WHETHER THE STATES ARE UNITED OR DISUNITED THERE WOULD STILL BE AN INTIMATE INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THEM WHICH WOULD ANSWER THE SAME ENDS THIS INTERCOURSE WOULD BE FETTERED INTERRUPTED AND NARROWED
846-130984-0048 BY A MULTIPLICITY OF CAUSES WHICH IN THE COURSE OF THESE PAPERS HAVE BEEN AMPLY DETAILED A UNITY OF COMMERCIAL AS WELL AS POLITICAL INTERESTS CAN ONLY RESULT FROM A UNITY OF GOVERNMENT
846-130984-0049 THERE ARE OTHER POINTS OF VIEW IN WHICH THIS SUBJECT MIGHT BE PLACED OF A STRIKING AND ANIMATING KIND BUT THEY WOULD LEAD US TOO FAR INTO THE REGIONS OF FUTURITY AND WOULD INVOLVE TOPICS NOT PROPER FOR A NEWSPAPER DISCUSSION
846-130984-0050 I SHALL BRIEFLY OBSERVE THAT OUR SITUATION INVITES AND OUR INTERESTS PROMPT US TO AIM AT AN ASCENDANT IN THE SYSTEM OF AMERICAN AFFAIRS THE WORLD MAY POLITICALLY AS WELL AS GEOGRAPHICALLY
846-130984-0051 BE DIVIDED INTO FOUR PARTS EACH HAVING A DISTINCT SET OF INTERESTS UNHAPPILY FOR THE OTHER THREE EUROPE BY HER ARMS AND BY HER NEGOTIATIONS BY FORCE AND BY FRAUD
846-130984-0052 HAS IN DIFFERENT DEGREES EXTENDED HER DOMINION OVER THEM ALL AFRICA ASIA AND AMERICA HAVE SUCCESSIVELY FELT HER DOMINATION
846-130984-0053 THE SUPERIORITY SHE HAS LONG MAINTAINED HAS TEMPTED HER TO PLUME HERSELF AS
846-130984-0054 AND TO CONSIDER THE REST OF MANKIND AS CREATED FOR HER BENEFIT MEN ADMIRED AS PROFOUND PHILOSOPHERS HAVE
846-130984-0055 ATTRIBUTED TO HER INHABITANTS A PHYSICAL SUPERIORITY AND HAVE GRAVELY ASSERTED THAT ALL ANIMALS AND WITH THEM THE HUMAN SPECIES DEGENERATE IN AMERICA
846-130984-0056 LET AMERICANS DISDAIN TO BE THE INSTRUMENTS OF EUROPEAN GREATNESS LET THE THIRTEEN STATES BOUND TOGETHER IN A STRICT AND INDISSOLUBLE UNION
