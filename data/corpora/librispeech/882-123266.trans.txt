882-123266-0000 HOSPITALITY UNDER THE ARCTIC CIRCLE IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN NIGHT TIME BUT UNDER THE SIXTY FIFTH PARALLEL THERE WAS NOTHING SURPRISING IN THE NOCTURNAL POLAR LIGHT IN ICELAND DURING THE MONTHS OF JUNE AND JULY THE SUN DOES NOT SET
882-123266-0001 BUT THE TEMPERATURE WAS MUCH LOWER I WAS COLD AND MORE HUNGRY THAN COLD
882-123266-0002 IT WAS A PEASANT'S HOUSE BUT IN POINT OF HOSPITALITY IT WAS EQUAL TO A KING'S ON OUR ARRIVAL THE MASTER CAME WITH OUTSTRETCHED HANDS AND WITHOUT MORE CEREMONY HE BECKONED US TO FOLLOW HIM
882-123266-0003 THEREFORE WE FOLLOWED AS HE BID US THE BUILDING WAS CONSTRUCTED OF ROUGHLY SQUARED TIMBERS WITH ROOMS ON BOTH SIDES FOUR IN NUMBER ALL OPENING OUT INTO THE ONE PASSAGE THESE WERE THE KITCHEN THE WEAVING SHOP THE BADSTOFA OR FAMILY SLEEPING ROOM
882-123266-0004 OF COURSE HIT HIS HEAD SEVERAL TIMES AGAINST THE BEAMS THAT PROJECTED FROM THE CEILINGS WE WERE INTRODUCED INTO OUR APARTMENT A LARGE ROOM WITH A FLOOR OF EARTH STAMPED HARD DOWN AND LIGHTED BY A WINDOW THE PANES OF WHICH WERE FORMED OF SHEEP'S BLADDER NOT ADMITTING TOO MUCH LIGHT
882-123266-0005 THE SLEEPING ACCOMMODATION CONSISTED OF DRY LITTER THROWN INTO TWO WOODEN FRAMES PAINTED RED AND ORNAMENTED WITH ICELANDIC SENTENCES I WAS HARDLY EXPECTING SO MUCH COMFORT THE ONLY DISCOMFORT PROCEEDED FROM THE STRONG ODOUR OF DRIED FISH HUNG MEAT
882-123266-0006 AND SOUR MILK OF WHICH MY NOSE MADE BITTER COMPLAINTS
882-123266-0007 THE ONLY ROOM WHERE A FIRE WAS LIGHTED EVEN IN THE SEVEREST COLD MY UNCLE LOST NO TIME IN OBEYING THE FRIENDLY CALL NOR WAS I SLACK IN FOLLOWING THE KITCHEN CHIMNEY WAS CONSTRUCTED ON THE ANCIENT PATTERN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WAS A STONE FOR A HEARTH
882-123266-0008 THE KITCHEN WAS ALSO A DINING ROOM AT OUR ENTRANCE THE HOST AS IF HE HAD NEVER SEEN US
882-123266-0009 SAELLVERTU WHICH MEANS BE HAPPY AND CAME AND KISSED US ON THE CHEEK AFTER HIM HIS WIFE PRONOUNCED THE SAME WORDS ACCOMPANIED WITH THE SAME CEREMONIAL THEN THE TWO PLACING THEIR HANDS UPON THEIR HEARTS INCLINED PROFOUNDLY BEFORE US
882-123266-0010 I HASTEN TO INFORM THE READER THAT THIS ICELANDIC LADY WAS THE MOTHER OF NINETEEN CHILDREN ALL BIG AND LITTLE SWARMING IN THE MIDST OF THE DENSE WREATHS OF SMOKE WITH WHICH THE FIRE ON THE HEARTH FILLED THE CHAMBER
882-123266-0011 EVERY MOMENT I NOTICED A FAIR HAIRED AND RATHER MELANCHOLY FACE PEEPING OUT OF THE ROLLING VOLUMES OF SMOKE
882-123266-0012 MY UNCLE AND I TREATED THIS LITTLE TRIBE WITH KINDNESS AND IN A VERY SHORT TIME WE EACH HAD THREE OR FOUR OF THESE BRATS ON OUR SHOULDERS AS MANY ON OUR LAPS AND THE REST BETWEEN OUR KNEES THOSE WHO COULD SPEAK KEPT REPEATING SAELLVERTU
882-123266-0013 IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE TONE THOSE THAT COULD NOT SPEAK MADE UP FOR THAT WANT BY SHRILL CRIES
882-123266-0014 AT THAT MOMENT OUR HUNTER RETURNED WHO HAD BEEN SEEING HIS HORSES PROVIDED FOR THAT IS TO SAY HE HAD ECONOMICALLY LET THEM LOOSE IN THE FIELDS WHERE THE POOR BEASTS HAD TO CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH THE SCANTY MOSS THEY COULD PULL OFF THE ROCKS AND A FEW MEAGRE SEA WEEDS
882-123266-0015 SAELLVERTU SAID HANS THEN CALMLY AUTOMATICALLY AND DISPASSIONATELY HE KISSED THE HOST THE HOSTESS AND THEIR NINETEEN CHILDREN THIS CEREMONY OVER WE SAT AT TABLE TWENTY FOUR IN NUMBER
882-123266-0016 AND THEREFORE ONE UPON ANOTHER THE LUCKIEST HAD ONLY TWO URCHINS UPON THEIR KNEES BUT SILENCE REIGNED IN ALL THIS LITTLE WORLD AT THE ARRIVAL OF THE SOUP AND THE NATIONAL TACITURNITY RESUMED ITS EMPIRE EVEN OVER THE CHILDREN
882-123266-0017 THE HOST SERVED OUT TO US A SOUP MADE OF LICHEN AND BY NO MEANS UNPLEASANT THEN AN IMMENSE PIECE OF DRIED FISH FLOATING IN BUTTER RANCID WITH TWENTY YEARS KEEPING AND THEREFORE ACCORDING TO ICELANDIC GASTRONOMY MUCH PREFERABLE TO FRESH BUTTER
882-123266-0018 ALONG WITH THIS WE HAD SKYE A SORT OF CLOTTED MILK WITH BISCUITS AND A LIQUID PREPARED FROM JUNIPER BERRIES FOR BEVERAGE WE HAD A THIN MILK MIXED WITH WATER CALLED IN THIS COUNTRY BLANDA
882-123266-0019 IT IS NOT FOR ME TO DECIDE WHETHER THIS DIET IS WHOLESOME OR NOT ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I WAS DESPERATELY HUNGRY AND THAT AT DESSERT I SWALLOWED TO THE VERY LAST GULP OF A THICK BROTH MADE FROM BUCKWHEAT
882-123266-0020 AS SOON AS THE MEAL WAS OVER THE CHILDREN DISAPPEARED AND THEIR ELDERS GATHERED ROUND THE PEAT FIRE WHICH ALSO BURNT SUCH MISCELLANEOUS FUEL AS BRIARS COW DUNG AND FISHBONES AFTER THIS LITTLE PINCH OF WARMTH THE DIFFERENT GROUPS RETIRED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE ROOMS
882-123266-0021 OUR HOSTESS HOSPITABLY OFFERED US HER ASSISTANCE IN UNDRESSING ACCORDING TO ICELANDIC USAGE BUT ON OUR GRACEFULLY DECLINING SHE INSISTED NO LONGER AND I WAS ABLE AT LAST TO CURL MYSELF UP IN MY MOSSY BED AT FIVE NEXT MORNING WE BADE OUR HOST FAREWELL
882-123266-0022 MY UNCLE WITH DIFFICULTY PERSUADING HIM TO ACCEPT A PROPER REMUNERATION AND HANS SIGNALLED THE START AT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM GARDAER THE SOIL BEGAN TO CHANGE ITS ASPECT
882-123266-0023 OF WHICH WE WERE FOLLOWING THE COUNTER SCARP OR LESSER STEEP OFTEN WE WERE MET BY STREAMS WHICH WE HAD TO FORD WITH GREAT CARE NOT TO WET OUR PACKAGES
882-123266-0024 SOMETIMES A SHARP TURN WOULD BRING US SUDDENLY WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF ONE OF THESE SPECTRES AND I WAS FILLED WITH LOATHING AT THE SIGHT OF A HUGE DEFORMED HEAD THE SKIN SHINING AND HAIRLESS AND REPULSIVE SORES VISIBLE THROUGH THE GAPS IN THE POOR CREATURE'S WRETCHED RAGS
882-123266-0025 THE UNHAPPY BEING FORBORE TO APPROACH US AND OFFER HIS MISSHAPEN HAND HE FLED AWAY BUT NOT BEFORE HANS HAD SALUTED HIM WITH THE CUSTOMARY SAELLVERTU SPETELSK SAID HE A LEPER MY UNCLE REPEATED THIS WORD PRODUCED A REPULSIVE EFFECT
882-123266-0026 THE HORRIBLE DISEASE OF LEPROSY IS TOO COMMON IN ICELAND IT IS NOT CONTAGIOUS BUT HEREDITARY AND LEPERS ARE FORBIDDEN TO MARRY
882-123266-0027 THE LAST TUFTS OF GRASS HAD DISAPPEARED FROM BENEATH OUR FEET NOT A TREE WAS TO BE SEEN UNLESS WE EXCEPT A FEW DWARF BIRCHES AS LOW AS BRUSHWOOD
882-123266-0028 SOMETIMES WE COULD SEE A HAWK BALANCING HIMSELF ON HIS WINGS UNDER THE GREY CLOUD
882-123266-0029 I FELT MELANCHOLY UNDER THIS SAVAGE ASPECT OF NATURE AND MY THOUGHTS WENT AWAY TO THE CHEERFUL SCENES I HAD LEFT IN THE FAR SOUTH WE HAD TO CROSS A FEW NARROW FIORDS AND AT LAST QUITE A WIDE GULF THE TIDE THEN HIGH ALLOWED US TO PASS OVER WITHOUT DELAY
882-123266-0030 AND TO REACH THE HAMLET OF ALFTANES ONE MILE BEYOND THAT EVENING AFTER HAVING FORDED TWO RIVERS FULL OF TROUT AND PIKE
882-123266-0031 WE WERE OBLIGED TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN A DESERTED BUILDING WORTHY TO BE HAUNTED BY ALL THE ELFINS OF SCANDINAVIA THE ICE KING CERTAINLY HELD COURT HERE AND GAVE US ALL NIGHT LONG SAMPLES OF WHAT HE COULD DO NO PARTICULAR EVENT MARKED THE NEXT DAY
882-123266-0032 BOGS DEAD LEVELS MELANCHOLY DESERT TRACKS WHEREVER WE TRAVELLED BY NIGHTFALL WE HAD ACCOMPLISHED HALF OUR JOURNEY AND WE LAY AT KROESOLBT
882-123266-0033 WE WALKED UPON HARDENED LAVA THIS GROUND IS CALLED IN THE COUNTRY HRAUN
882-123266-0034 SOMETIMES STRETCHED IN LENGTH SOMETIMES CONTORTED TOGETHER AN IMMENSE TORRENT ONCE LIQUID NOW SOLID RAN FROM THE NEAREST MOUNTAINS NOW EXTINCT VOLCANOES BUT THE RUINS AROUND REVEALED THE VIOLENCE OF THE PAST ERUPTIONS
882-123266-0035 YET HERE AND THERE WERE A FEW JETS OF STEAM FROM HOT SPRINGS
882-123266-0036 WE HAD TO PROCEED ON OUR WAY
882-123266-0037 OUR ROUTE NOW LAY WESTWARD WE HAD TURNED THE GREAT BAY OF FAXA AND THE TWIN PEAKS OF SNAEFELL
882-123266-0038 THE HORSES DID THEIR DUTY WELL NO DIFFICULTIES STOPPED THEM IN THEIR STEADY CAREER I WAS GETTING TIRED BUT MY UNCLE WAS AS FIRM AND STRAIGHT AS HE WAS AT OUR FIRST START I COULD NOT HELP ADMIRING HIS PERSISTENCY
882-123266-0039 AS WELL AS THE HUNTER'S WHO TREATED OUR EXPEDITION LIKE A MERE PROMENADE JUNE TWENTIETH AT SIX P M WE REACHED BUEDIR A VILLAGE ON THE SEA SHORE AND THE GUIDE THERE CLAIMING HIS DUE MY UNCLE SETTLED WITH HIM
882-123266-0040 WE WERE KINDLY RECEIVED AND WITHOUT TAXING TOO MUCH THE GOODNESS OF THESE FOLKS I WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE TARRIED HERE TO RECRUIT AFTER MY FATIGUES BUT MY UNCLE WHO WANTED NO RECRUITING WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT AND THE NEXT MORNING WE HAD TO BESTRIDE OUR BEASTS AGAIN THE SOIL TOLD OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE MOUNTAIN
882-123266-0041 WHOSE GRANITE FOUNDATIONS ROSE FROM THE EARTH LIKE THE KNOTTED ROOTS OF SOME HUGE OAK WE WERE ROUNDING THE IMMENSE BASE OF THE VOLCANO THE PROFESSOR HARDLY TOOK HIS EYES OFF IT HE TOSSED UP HIS ARMS AND SEEMED TO DEFY IT AND TO DECLARE THERE STANDS THE GIANT THAT I SHALL CONQUER
