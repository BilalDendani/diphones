3379-132601-0001 AS WELL AS TO SEE SOME OF HER FORMER FRIENDS SHE AND THE LADY BLANCHE EXTENDED THEIR WALK TO THE MONASTERY AT THE GATE STOOD A CARRIAGE WHICH FROM THE HEAT OF THE HORSES
3379-132601-0002 BUT A MORE THAN COMMON STILLNESS PERVADED THE COURT AND THE CLOISTERS THROUGH WHICH EMILY AND BLANCHE PASSED IN THEIR WAY TO THE GREAT HALL WHERE A NUN
3379-132601-0003 REPLIED TO THE ENQUIRIES OF THE FORMER THAT SISTER AGNES WAS STILL LIVING AND SENSIBLE BUT THAT IT WAS THOUGHT SHE COULD NOT SURVIVE THE NIGHT IN THE PARLOUR THEY FOUND SEVERAL OF THE BOARDERS WHO REJOICED TO SEE EMILY
3379-132601-0004 AND TOLD HER MANY LITTLE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE CONVENT SINCE HER DEPARTURE AND WHICH WERE INTERESTING TO HER ONLY BECAUSE THEY RELATED TO PERSONS
3379-132601-0005 WHILE THEY THUS CONVERSED THE ABBESS ENTERED THE ROOM AND EXPRESSED MUCH SATISFACTION AT SEEING EMILY BUT HER MANNER WAS UNUSUALLY SOLEMN AND HER COUNTENANCE DEJECTED
3379-132601-0006 AFTER THE FIRST SALUTATIONS WERE OVER IS TRULY A HOUSE OF MOURNING A DAUGHTER IS NOW PAYING THE DEBT OF NATURE YOU HAVE HEARD PERHAPS THAT OUR DAUGHTER AGNES IS DYING EMILY EXPRESSED HER SINCERE CONCERN
3379-132601-0007 HER DEATH PRESENTS TO US A GREAT AND AWFUL LESSON CONTINUED THE ABBESS LET US READ IT AND PROFIT BY IT LET IT TEACH US TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR THE CHANGE THAT AWAITS US ALL
3379-132601-0008 ARE THE GOOD DEEDS OF OUR LATTER YEARS IF THOSE OF OUR EARLY LIFE HAVE BEEN EVIL EMILY WOULD HAVE SAID THAT GOOD DEEDS SHE HOPED
3379-132601-0009 BUT SHE CONSIDERED THAT IT WAS THE ABBESS WHO SPOKE AND SHE REMAINED SILENT THE LATTER DAYS OF AGNES RESUMED THE ABBESS HAVE BEEN EXEMPLARY WOULD THEY MIGHT ATONE FOR THE ERRORS OF HER FORMER ONES
3379-132601-0010 HER SUFFERINGS NOW ALAS ARE GREAT LET US BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL MAKE HER PEACE HEREAFTER I HAVE LEFT HER WITH HER CONFESSOR AND A GENTLEMAN WHOM SHE HAS LONG BEEN ANXIOUS TO SEE AND WHO IS JUST ARRIVED FROM PARIS

3379-132601-0012 PERHAPS IT WOULD COMFORT HER TO SEE YOU WHEN HER PRESENT VISITORS HAVE LEFT HER WE WILL GO TO HER CHAMBER IF THE SCENE WILL NOT BE TOO MELANCHOLY FOR YOUR SPIRITS BUT INDEED TO SUCH SCENES HOWEVER PAINFUL
3379-132601-0013 WE OUGHT TO ACCUSTOM OURSELVES FOR THEY ARE SALUTARY TO THE SOUL AND PREPARE US FOR WHAT WE ARE OURSELVES TO SUFFER EMILY BECAME GRAVE AND THOUGHTFUL FOR THIS CONVERSATION BROUGHT TO HER RECOLLECTION
3379-132601-0014 THE DYING MOMENTS OF HER BELOVED FATHER AND SHE WISHED ONCE MORE TO WEEP OVER THE SPOT WHERE HIS REMAINS WERE BURIED DURING THE SILENCE
3379-132601-0015 MANY MINUTE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS LAST HOURS OCCURRED TO HER HIS EMOTION ON PERCEIVING HIMSELF TO BE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF CHATEAU LE BLANC HIS REQUEST TO BE INTERRED IN A PARTICULAR SPOT IN THE CHURCH OF THIS MONASTERY
3379-132601-0016 AND THE SOLEMN CHARGE HE HAD DELIVERED TO HER TO DESTROY CERTAIN PAPERS WITHOUT EXAMINING THEM SHE RECOLLECTED ALSO THE MYSTERIOUS AND HORRIBLE WORDS IN THOSE MANUSCRIPTS
3379-132601-0017 UPON WHICH HER EYE HAD INVOLUNTARILY GLANCED AND THOUGH THEY NOW AND INDEED WHENEVER SHE REMEMBERED THEM REVIVED AN EXCESS OF PAINFUL CURIOSITY CONCERNING THEIR FULL IMPORT AND THE MOTIVES FOR HER FATHER'S COMMAND
3379-132601-0018 IT WAS EVER HER CHIEF CONSOLATION THAT SHE HAD STRICTLY OBEYED HIM IN THIS PARTICULAR LITTLE MORE WAS SAID BY THE ABBESS WHO APPEARED TOO MUCH AFFECTED BY THE SUBJECT SHE HAD LATELY LEFT TO BE WILLING TO CONVERSE
3379-132601-0019 AND HER COMPANIONS HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME SILENT FROM THE SAME CAUSE WHEN THIS GENERAL REVERIE WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE ENTRANCE OF A STRANGER MONSIEUR BONNAC WHO HAD JUST QUITTED THE CHAMBER OF SISTER AGNES
3379-132601-0020 HE APPEARED MUCH DISTURBED BUT EMILY FANCIED THAT HIS COUNTENANCE HAD MORE THE EXPRESSION OF HORROR THAN OF GRIEF
3379-132601-0021 AND QUITTED THE ROOM THE ABBESS SOON AFTER PROPOSED GOING TO THE CHAMBER OF SISTER AGNES TO WHICH EMILY CONSENTED THOUGH NOT WITHOUT SOME RELUCTANCE AND LADY BLANCHE REMAINED WITH THE BOARDERS BELOW AT THE DOOR OF THE CHAMBER
3379-132601-0022 THEY MET THE CONFESSOR WHOM AS HE LIFTED UP HIS HEAD ON THEIR APPROACH EMILY OBSERVED TO BE THE SAME THAT HAD ATTENDED HER DYING FATHER BUT HE PASSED ON WITHOUT NOTICING HER AND THEY ENTERED THE APARTMENT WHERE
3379-132601-0023 ON A MATTRESS WAS LAID SISTER AGNES WITH ONE NUN WATCHING IN THE CHAIR BESIDE HER HER COUNTENANCE WAS SO MUCH CHANGED THAT EMILY WOULD SCARCELY HAVE RECOLLECTED HER HAD SHE NOT BEEN PREPARED TO DO SO
3379-132601-0024 TILL THEY STOOD AT THE BED SIDE THEN TURNING HER HEAVY EYES SHE FIXED THEM IN WILD HORROR UPON EMILY AND SCREAMING EXCLAIMED AH THAT VISION COMES UPON ME IN MY DYING HOURS
3379-132601-0025 AND LOOKED FOR EXPLANATION TO THE ABBESS
3379-132601-0026 AND CALMLY SAID TO AGNES DAUGHTER I HAVE BROUGHT MADEMOISELLE SAINT AUBERT TO VISIT YOU I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HER AGNES MADE NO REPLY BUT STILL GAZING WILDLY UPON EMILY EXCLAIMED

3379-132601-0030 TAKING HER HAND TRIED TO SUPPORT HER SPIRITS AND BEGGED SHE WOULD STAY A FEW MOMENTS WHEN AGNES WOULD PROBABLY BE CALM WHOM NOW SHE TRIED TO SOOTH BUT THE LATTER SEEMED TO DISREGARD HER
3379-132601-0031 WHILE SHE STILL FIXED HER EYES ON EMILY AND ADDED WHAT ARE YEARS OF PRAYERS AND REPENTANCE THEY CANNOT WASH OUT THE FOULNESS OF MURDER YES MURDER WHERE IS HE WHERE IS HE LOOK THERE LOOK THERE

3379-132601-0034 AGNES SUNK DOWN APPARENTLY LIFELESS AND EMILY UNABLE TO SUPPORT HERSELF LEANED AGAINST THE BED
3379-132601-0035 PEACE SAID THE ABBESS WHEN EMILY WAS GOING TO SPEAK THE DELIRIUM IS GOING OFF SHE WILL SOON REVIVE WHEN WAS SHE THUS BEFORE DAUGHTER NOT OF MANY WEEKS MADAM REPLIED THE NUN
3379-132601-0036 BUT HER SPIRITS HAVE BEEN MUCH AGITATED BY THE ARRIVAL OF THE GENTLEMAN SHE WISHED SO MUCH TO SEE YES OBSERVED THE ABBESS THAT HAS UNDOUBTEDLY OCCASIONED THIS PAROXYSM OF FRENZY WHEN SHE IS BETTER
3379-132601-0037 WE WILL LEAVE HER TO REPOSE EMILY VERY READILY CONSENTED BUT THOUGH SHE COULD NOW GIVE LITTLE ASSISTANCE SHE WAS UNWILLING TO QUIT THE CHAMBER WHILE ANY MIGHT BE NECESSARY WHEN AGNES RECOVERED HER SENSES
3379-132601-0038 SHE AGAIN FIXED HER EYES ON EMILY BUT THEIR WILD EXPRESSION WAS GONE AND A GLOOMY MELANCHOLY HAD SUCCEEDED IT WAS SOME MOMENTS BEFORE SHE RECOVERED SUFFICIENT SPIRITS TO SPEAK SHE THEN SAID FEEBLY

3379-132601-0040 ARE YOU NOT THE DAUGHTER OF THE MARCHIONESS WHAT MARCHIONESS SAID EMILY IN EXTREME SURPRISE FOR SHE HAD IMAGINED FROM THE CALMNESS OF AGNES'S MANNER THAT HER INTELLECTS WERE RESTORED
3379-132601-0041 BUT SHE REPEATED THE QUESTION WHAT MARCHIONESS EXCLAIMED AGNES I KNOW BUT OF ONE THE MARCHIONESS DE VILLEROI EMILY REMEMBERING THE EMOTION OF HER LATE FATHER UPON THE UNEXPECTED MENTION OF THIS LADY
3379-132601-0042 NOW FELT GREATLY INTERESTED AND SHE ENTREATED AGNES TO EXPLAIN THE REASON OF HER QUESTION
