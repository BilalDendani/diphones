1132-138883-0000 MISTER CHEESACRE'S DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN MISSUS GREENOW WAS LEFT ALONE IN HER LODGINGS AFTER THE LITTLE ENTERTAINMENT WHICH SHE HAD GIVEN TO HER TWO LOVERS SHE SAT HERSELF DOWN TO THINK SERIOUSLY
1132-138883-0001 IN THE WAY OF COURTING THEY WERE VERY PERSISTENT NO DOUBT BUT SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND HER
1132-138883-0002 THAT SHE WOULD HAVE NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER SHE WAS GOING TO LEAVE NORWICH AFTER EASTER AND THEY KNEW THAT SUCH WAS HER PURPOSE SOMETHING HAD BEEN SAID OF HER RETURNING TO YARMOUTH IN THE SUMMER SHE WAS A JUST WOMAN AT HEART AND JUSTICE REQUIRED THAT EACH OF THEM SHOULD KNOW
1132-138883-0003 WHAT WAS TO BE HIS PROSPECT IF SHE DID SO RETURN THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL TO BE SAID ON MISTER CHEESACRE'S BEHALF MAHOGANY FURNITURED BEDROOMS ASSIST ONE'S COMFORT IN THIS LIFE AND HEAPS OF MANURE THOUGH THEY ARE NOT BRILLIANT IN ROMANCE
1132-138883-0004 ARE VERY EFFICACIOUS IN FARMING MISSUS GREENOW BY NO MEANS DESPISED THESE THINGS AND AS FOR THE OWNER OF THEM THOUGH SHE SAW THAT THERE WAS MUCH AMISS IN HIS CHARACTER SHE THOUGHT THAT HIS LITTLE FOIBLES WERE OF SUCH A NATURE THAT SHE AS HIS WIFE
1132-138883-0005 OR ANY OTHER WOMAN OF SPIRIT MIGHT BE ABLE TO REPRESS THEM IF NOT TO CURE THEM BUT SHE HAD ALREADY MARRIED FOR MONEY ONCE AS SHE TOLD HERSELF VERY PLAINLY ON THIS OCCASION AND SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT NOW VENTURE ON A LITTLE LOVE HER MARRIAGE FOR MONEY
1132-138883-0006 AND SHE REALLY DID FEEL GRATEFUL TO HIS MEMORY I ALMOST THINK THAT AMONG THOSE PLENTIFUL TEARS SOME FEW DROPS BELONGED TO SINCERITY SHE WAS ESSENTIALLY A HAPPY TEMPERED WOMAN BLESSED WITH A GOOD DIGESTION
1132-138883-0007 WHO LOOKED BACK UPON HER PAST LIFE WITH CONTENTMENT AND FORWARD TO HER FUTURE LIFE WITH CONFIDENCE SHE WOULD NOT BE GREEDY SHE SAID TO HERSELF SHE DID NOT WANT MORE MONEY AND THEREFORE SHE WOULD HAVE NONE OF MISTER CHEESACRE
1132-138883-0008 SO FAR SHE RESOLVED RESOLVING ALSO THAT IF POSSIBLE THE MAHOGANY FURNITURED BEDROOMS SHOULD BE KEPT IN THE FAMILY AND MADE OVER TO HER NIECE
1132-138883-0009 BUT SHOULD SHE MARRY FOR LOVE AND IF SO SHOULD CAPTAIN BELLFIELD BE THE MAN STRANGE TO SAY HIS POVERTY AND HIS SCAMPISHNESS AND HIS LIES ALMOST RECOMMENDED HIM TO HER AT ANY RATE
1132-138883-0010 IT WAS NOT OF THOSE THINGS THAT SHE WAS AFRAID SHE HAD A WOMAN'S TRUE BELIEF IN HER OWN POWER AND THOUGHT THAT SHE COULD CURE THEM AS FAR AS THEY NEEDED CURE AS FOR HIS STORIES ABOUT INKERMAN AND HIS LITTLE DEBTS SHE CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
1132-138883-0011 SHE ALSO HAD HER INKERMANS AND WAS QUITE AWARE THAT SHE MADE AS GOOD USE OF THEM AS THE CAPTAIN DID OF HIS AND AS FOR THE DEBTS WHAT WAS A MAN TO DO WHO HADN'T GOT ANY MONEY
1132-138883-0012 IN THE ANTE GREENOW DAYS OF HER ADVENTURES BUT THERE WAS THIS DANGER THAT THERE MIGHT BE MORE BEHIND OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER HEARD ANOTHER MISSUS BELLFIELD WAS NOT IMPOSSIBLE AND WHAT
1132-138883-0013 IF INSTEAD OF BEING A REAL CAPTAIN AT ALL HE SHOULD BE A RETURNED TICKET OF LEAVE MAN SUCH THINGS HAD HAPPENED HER CHIEF SECURITY WAS IN THIS THAT CHEESACRE HAD KNOWN THE MAN FOR MANY YEARS
1132-138883-0014 BROUGHT TO HER SOME ARROWROOT WITH A LITTLE SHERRY IN IT SHE USUALLY DINED EARLY AND IT WAS HER HABIT TO TAKE A LIGHT REPAST BEFORE SHE RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT JEANNETTE SHE SAID AS SHE STIRRED THE LUMPS OF WHITE SUGAR IN THE BOWL I'M AFRAID THOSE TWO GENTLEMEN HAVE QUARRELLED
1132-138883-0015 OH LAWS MA'AM IN COURSE THEY HAVE HOW WAS THEY TO HELP IT JEANNETTE ON THESE OCCASIONS WAS IN THE HABIT OF STANDING BESIDE THE CHAIR OF HER MISTRESS AND CHATTING WITH HER AND THEN IF THE CHATTING WAS MUCH PROLONGED
1132-138883-0016 SHE WOULD GRADUALLY SINK DOWN UPON THE CORNER OF A CHAIR HERSELF AND THEN THE TWO WOMEN WOULD BE VERY COMFORTABLE TOGETHER OVER THE FIRE JEANNETTE NEVER FORGETTING THAT SHE WAS THE SERVANT AND MISSUS GREENOW NEVER FORGETTING THAT SHE WAS THE MISTRESS
1132-138883-0017 AND WHY SHOULD THEY QUARREL JEANNETTE IT'S VERY FOOLISH I DON'T KNOW ABOUT BEING FOOLISH MA'AM BUT IT'S THE MOST NATURAL THING IN LIFE
1132-138883-0018 IN COURSE I SHOULD EXPECT AS THEY WOULD PUNCH EACH OTHER'S HEADS THERE'S SOME GIRLS DO IT A PURPOSE BECAUSE THEY LIKE TO SEE IT ONE AT A TIME'S WHAT I SAY
1132-138883-0019 WELL MA'AM YES I AM YOUNG NO DOUBT BUT I WON'T SAY BUT WHAT I'VE HAD A BEAU YOUNG AS I LOOK BUT YOU DON'T SUPPOSE THAT I WANT BEAUX AS YOU CALL THEM I DON'T KNOW MA'AM AS YOU WANTS EM EXACTLY THAT'S AS MAY BE THERE THEY ARE
1132-138883-0020 IN THE GIG TO NIGHT I SHOULDN'T BE A BIT SURPRISED FOR ONE THERE'S NOTHING WON'T QUIET THEM AT OILEYMEAD TO NIGHT IF BRANDY AND WATER DON'T DO IT
1132-138883-0021 JEANNETTE SLIPT INTO HER CHAIR AND HELD UP HER HANDS IN TOKEN OF THE INTENSITY OF HER FEARS WHY YOU SILLY CHILD THEY'RE NOT GOING HOME TOGETHER AT ALL DID NOT THE CAPTAIN GO AWAY FIRST THE CAPTAIN DID GO AWAY FIRST CERTAINLY
1132-138883-0022 BUT I THOUGHT PERHAPS IT WAS TO GET HIS PISTOLS AND FIGHTING THINGS READY THEY WON'T FIGHT JEANNETTE GENTLEMEN HAVE GIVEN OVER FIGHTING HAVE THEY MA'AM THAT MAKES IT MUCH EASIER FOR LADIES NO DOUBT PERHAPS THEM PEACEABLE WAYS WILL COME DOWN TO SUCH AS US IN TIME
1132-138883-0023 IT'D BE A COMFORT I KNOW TO THEM AS ARE QUIET GIVEN LIKE ME I HATE TO SEE MEN KNOCKING EACH OTHER'S HEADS ABOUT I DO SO MISTER CHEESACRE AND THE CAPTAIN WON'T FIGHT MA'AM OF COURSE THEY WON'T YOU LITTLE FOOL YOU
1132-138883-0024 I WONDER WHICH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN I ALWAYS MADE UP MY MIND THAT
1132-138883-0025 UNLESS IT WAS HIS HEART YOU KNOW MA'AM BUT WHY SHOULD THEY QUARREL AT ALL JEANNETTE IT IS THE MOST FOOLISH THING WELL MA'AM I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT WHAT ELSE IS THEY TO DO THERE'S SOME THINGS AS YOU CAN CRY HALVES ABOUT
1132-138883-0026 JEANNETTE I WONDER HOW YOU CAN SAY SUCH THINGS AS IF I IN MY POSITION HAD EVER SAID A WORD TO ENCOURAGE EITHER OF THEM YOU KNOW IT'S NOT TRUE JEANNETTE AND YOU SHOULDN'T SAY SO WHEREUPON MISSUS GREENOW PUT HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER EYES
1132-138883-0027 AND JEANNETTE PROBABLY IN TOKEN OF CONTRITION PUT HER APRON TO HERS TO BE SURE MA'AM NO LADY COULD HAVE BEHAVED BETTER THROUGH IT THAN YOU HAVE DONE AND GOODNESS KNOWS YOU HAVE BEEN TRIED HARD INDEED I HAVE JEANNETTE
1132-138883-0028 AND IF GENTLEMEN WILL MAKE FOOLS OF THEMSELVES IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT IS IT MA'AM BUT I'M SO SORRY THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE QUARRELLED THEY WERE SUCH DEAR FRIENDS YOU KNOW QUITE ALL IN ALL TO EACH OTHER WHEN YOU'VE SETTLED WHICH IT'S TO BE MA'AM THAT'LL ALL COME RIGHT AGAIN
1132-138883-0029 THEN THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE I SUPPOSE MA'AM IT WON'T BE MISTER CHEESACRE TO BE SURE HE'S A MAN AS IS UNCOMMONLY WELL TO DO IN THE WORLD WHAT'S ALL THAT TO ME JEANNETTE I SHALL EVER REGARD MISTER CHEESACRE AS A DEAR FRIEND
1132-138883-0030 WHO HAS BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME AT A TIME OF TROUBLE BUT HE'LL NEVER BE MORE THAN THAT THEN IT'LL BE THE CAPTAIN MA'AM I'M SURE FOR MY PART I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THE CAPTAIN WAS THE NICER GENTLEMAN OF THE TWO AND HAVE ALWAYS SAID SO HE'S NOTHING TO ME GIRL
1132-138883-0031 AND AS FOR MONEY WHAT'S THE GOOD OF HAVING MORE THAN ENOUGH IF HE CAN BRING LOVE YOU CAN BRING MONEY CAN'T YOU MA'AM HE'S NOTHING TO ME GIRL REPEATED MISSUS GREENOW BUT HE WILL BE SAID JEANNETTE PLAINLY ASKING A QUESTION WELL I'M SURE
1132-138883-0032 WHAT'S THE WORLD COME TO I WONDER WHEN YOU SIT YOURSELF DOWN THERE AND CROSS EXAMINE YOUR MISTRESS IN THAT WAY GET TO BED WILL YOU IT'S NEAR TEN O'CLOCK I HOPE I HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING AMISS MA'AM AND JEANNETTE ROSE FROM HER SEAT
1132-138883-0033 IT'S MY FAULT FOR ENCOURAGING YOU SAID MISSUS GREENOW GO DOWN STAIRS AND FINISH YOUR WORK DO AND THEN TAKE YOURSELF OFF TO BED
1132-138883-0034 AND THERE'LL BE ALL MY THINGS TO SEE TO BEFORE THAT SO JEANNETTE GOT UP AND DEPARTED AND AFTER SOME FEW FURTHER THOUGHTS ABOUT CAPTAIN BELLFIELD MISSUS GREENOW HERSELF WENT TO HER BEDROOM MISTER CHEESACRE
1132-138883-0035 WHEN HE DROVE BACK TO OILEYMEAD ALONE FROM NORWICH AFTER DINING WITH MISSUS GREENOW HAD KEPT HIMSELF HOT AND ALMOST COMFORTABLE WITH PASSION AGAINST BELLFIELD AND HIS HEAT IF NOT HIS COMFORT HAD BEEN SUSTAINED BY HIS SEEING THE CAPTAIN
1132-138883-0036 WITH HIS PORTMANTEAU ESCAPING JUST AS HE REACHED HIS OWN HOMESTEAD BUT EARLY ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING HIS MIND REVERTED TO MISSUS GREENOW AND HE REMEMBERED WITH ANYTHING BUT SATISFACTION SOME OF THE HARD THINGS WHICH SHE HAD SAID TO HIM
1132-138883-0037 HE HAD MADE MISTAKES IN HIS MANNER OF WOOING HE WAS QUITE AWARE OF THAT NOW AND WAS DETERMINED THAT THEY SHOULD BE RECTIFIED FOR THE FUTURE SHE HAD REBUKED HIM FOR HAVING SAID NOTHING ABOUT HIS LOVE HE WOULD INSTANTLY MEND THAT FAULT
1132-138883-0038 AND SHE HAD BIDDEN HIM NOT TO BE SO COMMUNICATIVE ABOUT HIS WEALTH HENCEFORTH HE WOULD BE DUMB ON THAT SUBJECT NEVERTHELESS HE COULD NOT BUT THINK THAT THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH THE LADY ALREADY POSSESSED MUST BE OF SERVICE TO HIM
1132-138883-0039 HE WAS VERY FAR FROM FEELING THAT THE BATTLE WAS ALREADY LOST HER LAST WORD TO HIM HAD BEEN AN ASSURANCE OF HER FRIENDSHIP AND THEN WHY SHOULD SHE HAVE BEEN AT SO MUCH TROUBLE TO TELL HIM THE WAY IN WHICH HE OUGHT TO ADDRESS HER IF SHE WERE HERSELF INDIFFERENT AS TO HIS ADDRESSES
1132-138883-0040 HE COULD NOT TRUST HIMSELF TO THINK THAT SHE COULD REALLY WISH TO REFUSE HIM AFTER ALL THE ENCOURAGEMENT SHE HAD GIVEN HIM ON THIS OCCASION HE PUT ON NO PINK SHIRT OR SHINY BOOTS BEING DETERRED FROM DOING SO
1132-138883-0041 BUT NEVERTHELESS HE DRESSED HIMSELF WITH CONSIDERABLE CARE
