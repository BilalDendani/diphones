6227-60173-0000 BEFORE LEAVING BOSTON I DEVOTED ONE DAY TO AN EXCURSION TO LOWELL
6227-60173-0001 AND AM DESIROUS THAT MY READERS SHOULD DO THE SAME I MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH AN AMERICAN RAILROAD ON THIS OCCASION FOR THE FIRST TIME
6227-60173-0002 AS THESE WORKS ARE PRETTY MUCH ALIKE ALL THROUGH THE STATES THEIR GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS ARE EASILY DESCRIBED
6227-60173-0003 THE MAIN DISTINCTION BETWEEN
6227-60173-0004 EVERYBODY SMOKES AND IN THE SECOND NOBODY DOES AS A BLACK MAN NEVER TRAVELS WITH A WHITE ONE
6227-60173-0005 WHICH IS A GREAT BLUNDERING CLUMSY CHEST SUCH AS GULLIVER PUT TO SEA IN FROM THE KINGDOM OF BROBDINGNAG
6227-60173-0006 THE SEATS INSTEAD OF STRETCHING FROM END TO END ARE PLACED CROSSWISE EACH SEAT HOLDS TWO PERSONS THERE IS A LONG ROW OF THEM ON EACH SIDE OF THE CARAVAN
6227-60173-0007 A NARROW PASSAGE UP THE MIDDLE AND
6227-60173-0008 THERE IS USUALLY A STOVE FED WITH CHARCOAL OR ANTHRACITE COAL
6227-60173-0009 IT IS INSUFFERABLY CLOSE AND YOU SEE THE HOT AIR FLUTTERING BETWEEN YOURSELF AND ANY OTHER OBJECT YOU MAY HAPPEN TO LOOK AT LIKE THE GHOST OF SMOKE IN THE LADIES CAR
6227-60173-0010 WEARS NO UNIFORM HE WALKS UP AND DOWN THE CAR AND IN AND OUT OF IT AS HIS FANCY DICTATES LEANS AGAINST THE DOOR
6227-60173-0011 OR ENTERS INTO CONVERSATION WITH THE PASSENGERS ABOUT HIM A GREAT MANY NEWSPAPERS ARE PULLED OUT AND A FEW OF THEM ARE READ EVERYBODY TALKS TO YOU
6227-60173-0012 IF YOU SAY NO HE SAYS YES INTERROGATIVELY AND ASKS IN WHAT RESPECT THEY DIFFER YOU ENUMERATE THE HEADS OF DIFFERENCE ONE BY ONE AND HE SAYS YES
6227-60173-0013 STILL INTERROGATIVELY TO EACH THEN HE GUESSES THAT YOU DON'T TRAVEL FASTER IN ENGLAND
6227-60173-0014 SAYS YES AGAIN STILL INTERROGATIVELY AND IT IS QUITE EVIDENT DON'T BELIEVE IT
6227-60173-0015 AFTER A LONG PAUSE HE REMARKS PARTLY TO YOU AND PARTLY TO THE KNOB ON THE TOP OF HIS STICK THAT
6227-60173-0016 UPON WHICH YOU SAY YES
6227-60173-0017 YES AGAIN AFFIRMATIVELY THIS TIME AND UPON YOUR LOOKING OUT OF WINDOW TELLS YOU THAT BEHIND THAT HILL AND SOME THREE MILES FROM THE NEXT STATION
6227-60173-0018 YOUR ANSWER IN THE NEGATIVE NATURALLY LEADS TO MORE QUESTIONS IN REFERENCE TO YOUR INTENDED ROUTE ALWAYS PRONOUNCED ROUT AND WHEREVER YOU ARE GOING
6227-60173-0019 AND THAT ALL THE GREAT SIGHTS ARE SOMEWHERE ELSE IF A LADY TAKE A FANCY TO ANY MALE PASSENGER'S SEAT
6227-60173-0020 AND HE IMMEDIATELY VACATES IT WITH GREAT POLITENESS POLITICS ARE MUCH DISCUSSED SO ARE BANKS SO IS COTTON QUIET PEOPLE AVOID THE QUESTION OF THE PRESIDENCY
6227-60173-0021 FOR THERE WILL BE A NEW ELECTION IN THREE YEARS AND A HALF
6227-60173-0022 THE GREAT CONSTITUTIONAL FEATURE OF THIS INSTITUTION
6227-60173-0023 WHICH IS AN UNSPEAKABLE COMFORT TO ALL STRONG POLITICIANS AND TRUE LOVERS OF THEIR COUNTRY THAT IS TO SAY TO NINETY NINE MEN AND BOYS OUT OF EVERY NINETY NINE AND A QUARTER
6227-60173-0024 EXCEPT WHEN A BRANCH ROAD JOINS THE MAIN ONE THERE IS SELDOM MORE THAN ONE TRACK OF RAILS SO THAT THE ROAD IS VERY NARROW AND THE VIEW WHERE THERE IS A DEEP CUTTING BY NO MEANS EXTENSIVE
6227-60173-0025 WHEN THERE IS NOT THE CHARACTER OF THE SCENERY IS ALWAYS THE SAME MILE AFTER MILE OF STUNTED TREES SOME HEWN DOWN BY THE AXE SOME BLOWN DOWN BY THE WIND
6227-60173-0026 MANY MERE LOGS HALF HIDDEN IN THE SWAMP
6227-60173-0027 THE VERY SOIL OF THE EARTH IS MADE UP OF MINUTE FRAGMENTS SUCH AS THESE EACH POOL OF STAGNANT WATER HAS ITS CRUST OF VEGETABLE ROTTENNESS
6227-60173-0028 ON EVERY SIDE THERE ARE THE BOUGHS AND TRUNKS AND STUMPS OF TREES IN EVERY POSSIBLE STAGE OF DECAY DECOMPOSITION AND NEGLECT
6227-60173-0029 ON AN OPEN COUNTRY GLITTERING WITH SOME BRIGHT LAKE OR POOL BROAD AS MANY AN ENGLISH RIVER BUT SO SMALL HERE
6227-60173-0030 THE TRAIN CALLS AT STATIONS IN THE WOODS WHERE THE WILD IMPOSSIBILITY OF ANYBODY HAVING THE SMALLEST REASON TO GET OUT IS ONLY TO BE EQUALLED
6227-60173-0031 IT RUSHES ACROSS THE TURNPIKE ROAD WHERE THERE IS NO GATE NO POLICEMAN NO SIGNAL NOTHING BUT A ROUGH WOODEN ARCH ON WHICH IS PAINTED WHEN THE BELL RINGS LOOK OUT FOR THE LOCOMOTIVE
6227-60173-0032 CLATTERS OVER FRAIL ARCHES RUMBLES UPON THE HEAVY GROUND SHOOTS BENEATH A WOODEN BRIDGE WHICH INTERCEPTS THE LIGHT FOR A SECOND LIKE A WINK SUDDENLY AWAKENS
6227-60173-0033 AND PEOPLE LEANING FROM THEIR DOORS AND WINDOWS AND BOYS FLYING KITES AND PLAYING MARBLES AND MEN SMOKING AND WOMEN TALKING AND CHILDREN CRAWLING AND PIGS BURROWING AND UNACCUSTOMED HORSES PLUNGING AND REARING
6227-60173-0034 CLOSE TO THE VERY RAILS THERE ON ON ON TEARS THE MAD DRAGON OF AN ENGINE WITH ITS TRAIN OF CARS SCATTERING IN ALL DIRECTIONS A SHOWER OF BURNING SPARKS FROM ITS WOOD FIRE
6227-60173-0035 UNTIL AT LAST THE THIRSTY MONSTER STOPS BENEATH A COVERED WAY TO DRINK THE PEOPLE CLUSTER ROUND AND YOU HAVE TIME TO BREATHE AGAIN
6227-60173-0036 AND GLADLY PUTTING MYSELF UNDER HIS GUIDANCE DROVE OFF AT ONCE TO THAT QUARTER OF THE TOWN
6227-60173-0037 ALTHOUGH ONLY JUST OF AGE FOR IF MY RECOLLECTION SERVE ME IT HAS BEEN A MANUFACTURING TOWN BARELY ONE AND TWENTY YEARS
6227-60173-0038 THOSE INDICATIONS OF ITS YOUTH WHICH FIRST ATTRACT THE EYE GIVE IT A QUAINTNESS AND ODDITY OF CHARACTER WHICH
6227-60173-0039 IT WAS A VERY DIRTY WINTER'S DAY AND NOTHING IN THE WHOLE TOWN LOOKED OLD TO ME EXCEPT THE MUD WHICH IN SOME PARTS
6227-60173-0040 AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED THERE
6227-60173-0041 IN ONE PLACE THERE WAS A NEW WOODEN CHURCH WHICH HAVING NO STEEPLE AND BEING YET UNPAINTED LOOKED LIKE AN ENORMOUS PACKING CASE WITHOUT ANY DIRECTION UPON IT
6227-60173-0042 I WAS CAREFUL NOT TO DRAW MY BREATH AS WE PASSED AND TREMBLED WHEN I SAW A WORKMAN COME OUT UPON THE ROOF LEST WITH ONE THOUGHTLESS STAMP OF HIS FOOT HE SHOULD CRUSH THE STRUCTURE BENEATH HIM AND BRING IT RATTLING DOWN
6227-60173-0043 AMONG WHICH IT TAKES ITS COURSE
6227-60173-0044 IN ITS MURMURINGS AND TUMBLINGS AS ONE WOULD DESIRE TO SEE ONE WOULD SWEAR THAT EVERY BAKERY GROCERY AND BOOKBINDERY AND OTHER KIND OF STORE
6227-60173-0045 TOOK ITS SHUTTERS DOWN FOR THE FIRST TIME AND STARTED IN BUSINESS YESTERDAY
6227-60173-0046 AND WHEN I SAW A BABY
6227-60173-0047 WONDERING WHERE IT CAME FROM NEVER SUPPOSING FOR AN INSTANT THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN BORN IN SUCH A YOUNG TOWN AS THAT
6227-60173-0048 EACH OF WHICH BELONGS TO WHAT WE SHOULD TERM A COMPANY OF PROPRIETORS BUT WHAT THEY CALL IN AMERICA A CORPORATION I WENT OVER SEVERAL OF THESE SUCH AS A WOOLLEN FACTORY A CARPET FACTORY AND A COTTON FACTORY
6227-60173-0049 EXAMINED THEM IN EVERY PART AND SAW THEM IN THEIR ORDINARY WORKING ASPECT WITH NO PREPARATION OF ANY KIND OR DEPARTURE FROM THEIR ORDINARY EVERYDAY PROCEEDINGS I MAY ADD THAT I AM WELL ACQUAINTED
6227-60173-0050 VISITED MANY MILLS IN MANCHESTER AND ELSEWHERE IN THE SAME MANNER I HAPPENED TO ARRIVE AT THE FIRST FACTORY JUST AS THE DINNER HOUR WAS OVER
6227-60173-0051 INDEED THE STAIRS OF THE MILL WERE THRONGED WITH THEM AS I ASCENDED THEY WERE ALL WELL DRESSED
6227-60173-0052 FOR I LIKE TO SEE THE HUMBLER CLASSES OF SOCIETY
6227-60173-0053 AND EVEN IF THEY PLEASE
6227-60173-0054 AS A WORTHY ELEMENT OF SELF RESPECT IN ANY PERSON I EMPLOYED AND SHOULD NO MORE BE DETERRED FROM DOING SO BECAUSE SOME WRETCHED FEMALE
6227-60173-0055 THAN I WOULD ALLOW MY CONSTRUCTION OF THE REAL INTENT AND MEANING OF THE SABBATH TO BE INFLUENCED BY ANY WARNING TO THE WELL DISPOSED FOUNDED ON HIS BACKSLIDINGS ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY
6227-60173-0056 WHICH MIGHT EMANATE FROM THE RATHER DOUBTFUL AUTHORITY
6227-60173-0057 AS I HAVE SAID WERE ALL WELL DRESSED
6227-60173-0058 THEY HAD SERVICEABLE BONNETS GOOD WARM CLOAKS AND SHAWLS AND WERE NOT ABOVE CLOGS AND PATTENS MOREOVER
6227-60173-0059 AND THERE WERE CONVENIENCES FOR WASHING THEY WERE HEALTHY IN APPEARANCE MANY OF THEM REMARKABLY SO
6227-60173-0060 THE MOST LISPING
6227-60173-0061 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THE CARELESS MOPING SLATTERNLY DEGRADED
6227-60173-0062 AS THEMSELVES IN THE WINDOWS OF SOME THERE WERE GREEN PLANTS WHICH WERE TRAINED TO SHADE THE GLASS IN ALL THERE WAS AS MUCH FRESH AIR CLEANLINESS AND COMFORT
6227-60173-0063 AS THE NATURE OF THE OCCUPATION WOULD POSSIBLY ADMIT OF OUT OF SO LARGE A NUMBER OF FEMALES
6227-60173-0064 ONLY THEN JUST VERGING UPON WOMANHOOD IT MAY BE REASONABLY SUPPOSED THAT SOME WERE DELICATE AND FRAGILE IN APPEARANCE
6227-60173-0065 BUT I SOLEMNLY DECLARE THAT FROM ALL THE CROWD I SAW IN THE DIFFERENT FACTORIES THAT DAY I CANNOT RECALL OR SEPARATE ONE YOUNG FACE THAT GAVE ME A PAINFUL IMPRESSION
6227-60173-0066 NOT ONE YOUNG GIRL WHOM ASSUMING IT TO BE A MATTER OF NECESSITY THAT SHE SHOULD GAIN HER DAILY BREAD BY THE LABOUR OF HER HANDS I WOULD HAVE REMOVED FROM THOSE WORKS
6227-60173-0067 THEY RESIDE IN VARIOUS BOARDING HOUSES NEAR AT HAND
6227-60173-0068 WHOSE CHARACTERS HAVE NOT UNDERGONE THE MOST SEARCHING
6227-60173-0069 ANY COMPLAINT THAT IS MADE AGAINST THEM BY THE BOARDERS OR BY ANY ONE ELSE IS FULLY INVESTIGATED
6227-60173-0070 THEY ARE REMOVED AND THEIR OCCUPATION IS HANDED OVER TO SOME MORE DESERVING PERSON THERE ARE A FEW CHILDREN EMPLOYED IN THESE FACTORIES BUT NOT MANY THE LAWS OF THE STATE FORBID THEIR WORKING MORE THAN NINE MONTHS IN THE YEAR
6227-60173-0071 AND THERE ARE CHURCHES AND CHAPELS OF VARIOUS PERSUASIONS
6227-60173-0072 IN WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN EDUCATED AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE FACTORIES AND ON THE HIGHEST AND PLEASANTEST GROUND IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD STANDS THEIR HOSPITAL OR BOARDING HOUSE FOR THE SICK
6227-60173-0073 IT IS THE BEST HOUSE IN THOSE PARTS AND WAS BUILT BY AN EMINENT MERCHANT
6227-60173-0074 LIKE THAT INSTITUTION AT BOSTON WHICH I HAVE BEFORE DESCRIBED IT IS NOT PARCELLED OUT INTO WARDS BUT IS DIVIDED INTO CONVENIENT CHAMBERS
6227-60173-0075 EACH OF WHICH HAS ALL THE COMFORTS OF A VERY COMFORTABLE HOME THE PRINCIPAL MEDICAL ATTENDANT RESIDES UNDER THE SAME ROOF
6227-60173-0076 OR ATTENDED WITH GREATER GENTLENESS AND CONSIDERATION THE WEEKLY CHARGE IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT FOR EACH FEMALE PATIENT IS THREE DOLLARS OR TWELVE SHILLINGS ENGLISH BUT NO GIRL EMPLOYED BY ANY OF THE CORPORATIONS
6227-60173-0077 MAY BE GATHERED FROM THE FACT THAT IN JULY EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE NO FEWER THAN NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT OF THESE GIRLS
6227-60173-0078 THE AMOUNT OF WHOSE JOINT SAVINGS WAS ESTIMATED AT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR TWENTY THOUSAND ENGLISH POUNDS
6227-60173-0079 A GREAT MANY OF THE BOARDING HOUSES SECONDLY NEARLY ALL THESE YOUNG LADIES SUBSCRIBE TO CIRCULATING LIBRARIES
6227-60173-0080 A REPOSITORY OF ORIGINAL ARTICLES WRITTEN EXCLUSIVELY BY FEMALES ACTIVELY EMPLOYED IN THE MILLS WHICH IS DULY PRINTED PUBLISHED AND SOLD
6227-60173-0081 FOUR HUNDRED GOOD SOLID PAGES WHICH I HAVE READ FROM BEGINNING TO END THE LARGE CLASS OF READERS STARTLED BY THESE FACTS WILL EXCLAIM WITH ONE VOICE HOW VERY PREPOSTEROUS
6227-60173-0082 THESE THINGS ARE ABOVE THEIR STATION IN REPLY TO THAT OBJECTION
6227-60173-0083 THEY LABOUR IN THESE MILLS UPON AN AVERAGE TWELVE HOURS A DAY WHICH IS UNQUESTIONABLY
6227-60173-0084 FROM ACCUSTOMING OURSELVES TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF THAT CLASS AS THEY ARE
6227-60173-0085 I THINK THAT
6227-60173-0086 STARTLE US BY THEIR NOVELTY AND NOT BY THEIR BEARING UPON ANY ABSTRACT QUESTION OF RIGHT OR WRONG FOR MYSELF I KNOW NO STATION IN WHICH THE OCCUPATION OF TO DAY CHEERFULLY DONE
6227-60173-0087 I KNOW NO STATION WHICH HAS A RIGHT TO MONOPOLISE THE MEANS OF MUTUAL INSTRUCTION IMPROVEMENT AND RATIONAL ENTERTAINMENT OR WHICH HAS EVER CONTINUED TO BE A STATION VERY LONG
6227-60173-0088 AS A LITERARY PRODUCTION
6227-60173-0089 THE FACT OF THE ARTICLES
6227-60173-0090 AND CONTENTMENT AND TEACH GOOD DOCTRINES OF ENLARGED BENEVOLENCE A STRONG FEELING FOR THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE AS DISPLAYED IN THE SOLITUDES THE WRITERS HAVE LEFT AT HOME
6227-60173-0091 IS A FAVOURABLE SCHOOL FOR THE STUDY OF SUCH TOPICS
6227-60173-0092 TO FINE CLOTHES FINE MARRIAGES FINE HOUSES OR FINE LIFE SOME PERSONS MIGHT OBJECT TO THE PAPERS BEING SIGNED OCCASIONALLY WITH RATHER FINE NAMES BUT THIS IS AN AMERICAN FASHION
6227-60173-0093 ONE OF THE PROVINCES OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE OF MASSACHUSETTS
6227-60173-0094 AS THE CHILDREN IMPROVE UPON THE TASTES OF THEIR PARENTS THESE CHANGES COSTING LITTLE OR NOTHING SCORES OF MARY ANNES ARE SOLEMNLY CONVERTED INTO BEVELINAS EVERY SESSION IT IS SAID
6227-60173-0095 THAT ON THE OCCASION OF A VISIT FROM GENERAL JACKSON OR GENERAL HARRISON TO THIS TOWN I FORGET WHICH BUT IT IS NOT TO THE PURPOSE HE WALKED THROUGH THREE MILES AND A HALF OF THESE YOUNG LADIES
6227-60173-0096 ALL DRESSED OUT WITH PARASOLS AND SILK STOCKINGS
6227-60173-0097 THAT ANY WORSE CONSEQUENCE ENSUED THAN A SUDDEN LOOKING UP OF ALL THE PARASOLS AND SILK STOCKINGS IN THE MARKET AND PERHAPS THE BANKRUPTCY OF SOME SPECULATIVE NEW ENGLANDER WHO BOUGHT THEM ALL UP AT ANY PRICE
6227-60173-0098 IN EXPECTATION OF A DEMAND THAT NEVER CAME I SET NO GREAT STORE BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THIS BRIEF ACCOUNT OF LOWELL AND INADEQUATE EXPRESSION OF THE GRATIFICATION IT YIELDED ME
6227-60173-0099 AND THOSE OF OUR OWN LAND MANY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHOSE STRONG INFLUENCE HAS BEEN AT WORK FOR YEARS IN OUR MANUFACTURING TOWNS
6227-60173-0100 SO TO SPEAK FOR THESE GIRLS OFTEN THE DAUGHTERS OF SMALL FARMERS COME FROM OTHER STATES
6227-60173-0101 THE CONTRAST WOULD BE A STRONG ONE FOR IT WOULD BE BETWEEN THE GOOD AND EVIL
6227-60173-0102 I ABSTAIN FROM IT
6227-60173-0103 ALL THOSE WHOSE EYES MAY REST ON THESE PAGES TO PAUSE AND REFLECT UPON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS TOWN AND THOSE GREAT HAUNTS OF DESPERATE MISERY TO CALL TO MIND
6227-60173-0104 IF THEY CAN IN THE MIDST OF PARTY STRIFE AND SQUABBLE THE EFFORTS THAT MUST BE MADE TO PURGE THEM OF THEIR SUFFERING AND DANGER AND LAST AND FOREMOST TO REMEMBER HOW THE PRECIOUS TIME IS RUSHING BY
6227-60173-0105 I RETURNED AT NIGHT BY THE SAME RAILROAD AND IN THE SAME KIND OF CAR ONE OF THE PASSENGERS BEING EXCEEDINGLY ANXIOUS TO EXPOUND AT GREAT LENGTH TO MY COMPANION NOT TO ME OF COURSE
6227-60173-0106 I FEIGNED TO FALL ASLEEP BUT GLANCING ALL THE WAY OUT AT WINDOW FROM THE CORNERS OF MY EYES
6227-60173-0107 IN WATCHING THE EFFECTS OF THE WOOD FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN INVISIBLE IN THE MORNING BUT WERE NOW BROUGHT OUT IN FULL RELIEF BY THE DARKNESS
