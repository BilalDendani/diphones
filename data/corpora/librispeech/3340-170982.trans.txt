3340-170982-0000 I SHALL SAY OF THEM WHAT YOU WERE SAYING OF THE OTHERS THAT AS THEY GROW OLDER THEY BECOME RULERS IN THEIR OWN CITY IF THEY CARE TO BE
3340-170982-0001 THEY MARRY WHOM THEY LIKE AND GIVE IN MARRIAGE TO WHOM THEY WILL ALL THAT YOU SAID OF THE OTHERS I NOW SAY OF THESE AND ON THE OTHER HAND OF THE UNJUST I SAY THAT THE GREATER NUMBER
3340-170982-0002 AND YOU MAY SUPPOSE THAT I HAVE REPEATED THE REMAINDER OF YOUR TALE OF HORRORS BUT WILL YOU LET ME ASSUME WITHOUT RECITING THEM THAT THESE THINGS ARE TRUE
3340-170982-0003 CERTAINLY HE SAID WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE THESE THEN ARE THE PRIZES AND REWARDS AND GIFTS WHICH ARE BESTOWED UPON THE JUST BY GODS AND MEN IN THIS PRESENT LIFE IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER GOOD THINGS WHICH JUSTICE OF HERSELF PROVIDES YES HE SAID
3340-170982-0004 AND THEY ARE FAIR AND LASTING AND YET I SAID ALL THESE ARE AS NOTHING EITHER IN NUMBER OR GREATNESS IN COMPARISON WITH THOSE OTHER RECOMPENSES WHICH AWAIT BOTH JUST AND UNJUST AFTER DEATH AND YOU OUGHT TO HEAR THEM
3340-170982-0005 NOT ONE OF THE TALES WHICH ODYSSEUS TELLS TO THE HERO ALCINOUS YET THIS TOO IS A TALE OF A HERO
3340-170982-0006 AND THAT THEY CAME TO A MYSTERIOUS PLACE AT WHICH THERE WERE TWO OPENINGS IN THE EARTH THEY WERE NEAR TOGETHER AND OVER AGAINST THEM WERE TWO OTHER OPENINGS IN THE HEAVEN ABOVE IN THE INTERMEDIATE SPACE THERE WERE JUDGES SEATED
3340-170982-0007 WHO COMMANDED THE JUST AFTER THEY HAD GIVEN JUDGMENT ON THEM AND HAD BOUND THEIR SENTENCES IN FRONT OF THEM TO ASCEND BY THE HEAVENLY WAY ON THE RIGHT HAND AND IN LIKE MANNER THE UNJUST WERE BIDDEN BY THEM TO DESCEND BY THE LOWER WAY ON THE LEFT HAND
3340-170982-0008 THESE ALSO BORE THE SYMBOLS OF THEIR DEEDS BUT FASTENED ON THEIR BACKS HE DREW NEAR AND THEY TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS TO BE THE MESSENGER WHO WOULD CARRY THE REPORT OF THE OTHER WORLD TO MEN AND THEY BADE HIM HEAR AND SEE ALL THAT WAS TO BE HEARD AND SEEN IN THAT PLACE
3340-170982-0009 AND ARRIVING EVER AND ANON THEY SEEMED TO HAVE COME FROM A LONG JOURNEY AND THEY WENT FORTH WITH GLADNESS INTO THE MEADOW WHERE THEY ENCAMPED AS AT A FESTIVAL AND THOSE WHO KNEW ONE ANOTHER EMBRACED AND CONVERSED THE SOULS WHICH CAME FROM EARTH CURIOUSLY ENQUIRING ABOUT THE THINGS ABOVE
3340-170982-0010 THOSE FROM BELOW WEEPING AND SORROWING AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE THINGS WHICH THEY HAD ENDURED AND SEEN IN THEIR JOURNEY BENEATH THE EARTH NOW THE JOURNEY LASTED A THOUSAND YEARS WHILE THOSE FROM ABOVE WERE DESCRIBING HEAVENLY DELIGHTS AND VISIONS OF INCONCEIVABLE BEAUTY
3340-170982-0011 IF FOR EXAMPLE THERE WERE ANY WHO HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF MANY DEATHS OR HAD BETRAYED OR ENSLAVED CITIES OR ARMIES OR BEEN GUILTY OF ANY OTHER EVIL BEHAVIOUR FOR EACH AND ALL OF THEIR OFFENCES THEY RECEIVED PUNISHMENT TEN TIMES OVER
3340-170982-0012 OF PIETY AND IMPIETY TO GODS AND PARENTS AND OF MURDERERS THERE WERE RETRIBUTIONS OTHER AND GREATER FAR WHICH HE DESCRIBED HE MENTIONED THAT HE WAS PRESENT WHEN ONE OF THE SPIRITS ASKED ANOTHER WHERE IS ARDIAEUS THE GREAT
3340-170982-0013 NOW THIS ARDIAEUS LIVED A THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE THE TIME OF ER HE HAD BEEN THE TYRANT OF SOME CITY OF PAMPHYLIA AND HAD MURDERED HIS AGED FATHER AND HIS ELDER BROTHER AND WAS SAID TO HAVE COMMITTED MANY OTHER ABOMINABLE CRIMES THE ANSWER OF THE OTHER SPIRIT WAS
3340-170982-0014 HE COMES NOT HITHER AND WILL NEVER COME AND THIS SAID HE WAS ONE OF THE DREADFUL SIGHTS WHICH WE OURSELVES WITNESSED WE WERE AT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVERN AND HAVING COMPLETED ALL OUR EXPERIENCES WERE ABOUT TO REASCEND WHEN OF A SUDDEN ARDIAEUS APPEARED AND SEVERAL OTHERS
3340-170982-0015 MOST OF WHOM WERE TYRANTS AND THERE WERE ALSO BESIDES THE TYRANTS PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD BEEN GREAT CRIMINALS
3340-170982-0016 THEY WERE JUST AS THEY FANCIED ABOUT TO RETURN INTO THE UPPER WORLD BUT THE MOUTH INSTEAD OF ADMITTING THEM GAVE A ROAR WHENEVER ANY OF THESE INCURABLE SINNERS OR SOME ONE WHO HAD NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY PUNISHED TRIED TO ASCEND
3340-170982-0017 AND THEN WILD MEN OF FIERY ASPECT WHO WERE STANDING BY AND HEARD THE SOUND SEIZED AND CARRIED THEM OFF
3340-170982-0018 AND THREW THEM DOWN AND FLAYED THEM WITH SCOURGES AND DRAGGED THEM ALONG THE ROAD AT THE SIDE CARDING THEM ON THORNS LIKE WOOL AND DECLARING TO THE PASSERS BY WHAT WERE THEIR CRIMES AND THAT THEY WERE BEING TAKEN AWAY TO BE CAST INTO HELL AND OF ALL THE MANY TERRORS WHICH THEY HAD ENDURED HE SAID THAT
3340-170982-0019 AND WHEN THERE WAS SILENCE ONE BY ONE THEY ASCENDED WITH EXCEEDING JOY THESE SAID ER WERE THE PENALTIES AND RETRIBUTIONS AND THERE WERE BLESSINGS AS GREAT
3340-170982-0020 ON THE FOURTH DAY AFTER HE SAID THAT THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD SEE FROM ABOVE A LINE OF LIGHT STRAIGHT AS A COLUMN
3340-170982-0021 FROM THESE ENDS IS EXTENDED THE SPINDLE OF NECESSITY ON WHICH ALL THE REVOLUTIONS TURN THE SHAFT AND HOOK OF THIS SPINDLE ARE MADE OF STEEL AND THE WHORL IS MADE PARTLY OF STEEL AND ALSO PARTLY OF OTHER MATERIALS
3340-170982-0022 NOW THE WHORL IS IN FORM LIKE THE WHORL USED ON EARTH AND THE DESCRIPTION OF IT IMPLIED THAT THERE IS ONE LARGE HOLLOW WHORL WHICH IS QUITE SCOOPED OUT AND INTO THIS IS FITTED ANOTHER LESSER ONE AND ANOTHER
3340-170982-0023 AND ANOTHER AND FOUR OTHERS MAKING EIGHT IN ALL LIKE VESSELS WHICH FIT INTO ONE ANOTHER THE WHORLS SHOW THEIR EDGES ON THE UPPER SIDE AND ON THEIR LOWER SIDE ALL TOGETHER FORM ONE CONTINUOUS WHORL THIS IS PIERCED BY THE SPINDLE WHICH IS DRIVEN HOME THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE EIGHTH
3340-170982-0024 THE SIXTH IS NEXT TO THE FIRST IN SIZE THE FOURTH NEXT TO THE SIXTH THEN COMES THE EIGHTH THE SEVENTH IS FIFTH THE FIFTH IS SIXTH THE THIRD IS SEVENTH LAST AND EIGHTH COMES THE SECOND THE LARGEST OR FIXED STARS IS SPANGLED AND THE SEVENTH
3340-170982-0025 OR SUN IS BRIGHTEST THE EIGHTH OR MOON COLOURED BY THE REFLECTED LIGHT OF THE SEVENTH THE SECOND AND FIFTH SATURN AND MERCURY ARE IN COLOUR LIKE ONE ANOTHER AND YELLOWER THAN THE PRECEDING THE THIRD VENUS HAS THE WHITEST LIGHT
3340-170982-0026 THE FOURTH MARS IS REDDISH THE SIXTH JUPITER IS IN WHITENESS SECOND NOW THE WHOLE SPINDLE HAS THE SAME MOTION BUT AS THE WHOLE REVOLVES IN ONE DIRECTION THE SEVEN INNER CIRCLES MOVE SLOWLY IN THE OTHER AND OF THESE THE SWIFTEST IS THE EIGHTH
3340-170982-0027 THE THIRD APPEARED FOURTH AND THE SECOND FIFTH THE SPINDLE TURNS ON THE KNEES OF NECESSITY AND ON THE UPPER SURFACE OF EACH CIRCLE IS A SIREN WHO GOES ROUND WITH THEM HYMNING A SINGLE TONE OR NOTE THE EIGHT TOGETHER FORM ONE HARMONY
3340-170982-0028 WHO ACCOMPANY WITH THEIR VOICES THE HARMONY OF THE SIRENS LACHESIS SINGING OF THE PAST CLOTHO OF THE PRESENT
3340-170982-0029 CLOTHO FROM TIME TO TIME
3340-170982-0030 AND LACHESIS LAYING HOLD OF EITHER IN TURN FIRST WITH ONE HAND AND THEN WITH THE OTHER WHEN ER AND THE SPIRITS ARRIVED THEIR DUTY WAS TO GO AT ONCE TO LACHESIS
3340-170982-0031 MORTAL SOULS BEHOLD A NEW CYCLE OF LIFE AND MORTALITY YOUR GENIUS WILL NOT BE ALLOTTED TO YOU BUT YOU WILL CHOOSE YOUR GENIUS AND LET HIM WHO DRAWS THE FIRST LOT HAVE THE FIRST CHOICE AND THE LIFE WHICH HE CHOOSES SHALL BE HIS DESTINY
3340-170982-0032 VIRTUE IS FREE AND AS A MAN HONOURS OR DISHONOURS HER HE WILL HAVE MORE OR LESS OF HER THE RESPONSIBILITY IS WITH THE CHOOSER GOD IS JUSTIFIED
3340-170982-0033 WHEN THE INTERPRETER HAD THUS SPOKEN HE SCATTERED LOTS INDIFFERENTLY AMONG THEM ALL AND EACH OF THEM TOOK UP THE LOT WHICH FELL NEAR HIM ALL BUT ER HIMSELF HE WAS NOT ALLOWED AND EACH AS HE TOOK HIS LOT PERCEIVED THE NUMBER WHICH HE HAD OBTAINED
3340-170982-0034 THEN THE INTERPRETER PLACED ON THE GROUND BEFORE THEM THE SAMPLES OF LIVES AND THERE WERE MANY MORE LIVES THAN THE SOULS PRESENT AND THEY WERE OF ALL SORTS THERE WERE LIVES OF EVERY ANIMAL AND OF MAN IN EVERY CONDITION AND THERE WERE TYRANNIES AMONG THEM SOME LASTING OUT THE TYRANT'S LIFE
3340-170982-0035 OTHERS WHICH BROKE OFF IN THE MIDDLE AND CAME TO AN END IN POVERTY AND EXILE AND BEGGARY AND THERE WERE LIVES OF FAMOUS MEN SOME WHO WERE FAMOUS FOR THEIR FORM AND BEAUTY AS WELL AS FOR THEIR STRENGTH AND SUCCESS IN GAMES OR AGAIN FOR THEIR BIRTH AND THE QUALITIES OF THEIR ANCESTORS
3340-170982-0036 AND SOME WHO WERE THE REVERSE OF FAMOUS FOR THE OPPOSITE QUALITIES AND OF WOMEN LIKEWISE THERE WAS NOT HOWEVER ANY DEFINITE CHARACTER IN THEM BECAUSE THE SOUL WHEN CHOOSING A NEW LIFE MUST OF NECESSITY BECOME DIFFERENT
3340-170982-0037 AND SO TO CHOOSE ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE THE BETTER LIFE AS HE HAS OPPORTUNITY HE SHOULD CONSIDER THE BEARING OF ALL THESE THINGS WHICH HAVE BEEN MENTIONED SEVERALLY AND COLLECTIVELY UPON VIRTUE
3340-170982-0038 OF STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS OF CLEVERNESS AND DULLNESS AND OF ALL THE NATURAL AND ACQUIRED GIFTS OF THE SOUL AND THE OPERATION OF THEM WHEN CONJOINED
3340-170982-0039 AND GOOD TO THE LIFE WHICH WILL MAKE HIS SOUL MORE JUST ALL ELSE HE WILL DISREGARD
3340-170982-0040 FOR WE HAVE SEEN AND KNOW THAT THIS IS THE BEST CHOICE BOTH IN LIFE AND AFTER DEATH A MAN MUST TAKE WITH HIM INTO THE WORLD BELOW AN ADAMANTINE FAITH IN TRUTH AND RIGHT THAT THERE TOO HE MAY BE UNDAZZLED BY THE DESIRE OF WEALTH OR THE OTHER ALLUREMENTS OF EVIL
3340-170982-0041 NOT ONLY IN THIS LIFE BUT IN ALL THAT WHICH IS TO COME FOR THIS IS THE WAY OF HAPPINESS AND ACCORDING TO THE REPORT OF THE MESSENGER FROM THE OTHER WORLD THIS WAS WHAT THE PROPHET SAID AT THE TIME EVEN FOR THE LAST COMER IF HE CHOOSES WISELY AND WILL LIVE DILIGENTLY
3340-170982-0042 THERE IS APPOINTED A HAPPY AND NOT UNDESIRABLE EXISTENCE LET NOT HIM WHO CHOOSES FIRST BE CARELESS AND LET NOT THE LAST DESPAIR
3340-170982-0043 AND WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN HE WHO HAD THE FIRST CHOICE CAME FORWARD AND IN A MOMENT CHOSE THE GREATEST TYRANNY HIS MIND HAVING BEEN DARKENED BY FOLLY AND SENSUALITY HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OUT THE WHOLE MATTER BEFORE HE CHOSE
3340-170982-0044 AND DID NOT AT FIRST SIGHT PERCEIVE THAT HE WAS FATED AMONG OTHER EVILS TO DEVOUR HIS OWN CHILDREN BUT WHEN HE HAD TIME TO REFLECT AND SAW WHAT WAS IN THE LOT HE BEGAN TO BEAT HIS BREAST AND LAMENT OVER HIS CHOICE FORGETTING THE PROCLAMATION OF THE PROPHET
3340-170982-0045 FOR INSTEAD OF THROWING THE BLAME OF HIS MISFORTUNE ON HIMSELF HE ACCUSED CHANCE AND THE GODS AND EVERYTHING RATHER THAN HIMSELF NOW HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO CAME FROM HEAVEN AND IN A FORMER LIFE HAD DWELT IN A WELL ORDERED STATE BUT HIS VIRTUE WAS A MATTER OF HABIT ONLY AND HE HAD NO PHILOSOPHY
3340-170982-0046 AND IT WAS TRUE OF OTHERS WHO WERE SIMILARLY OVERTAKEN THAT THE GREATER NUMBER OF THEM CAME FROM HEAVEN AND THEREFORE THEY HAD NEVER BEEN SCHOOLED BY TRIAL WHEREAS THE PILGRIMS WHO CAME FROM EARTH HAVING THEMSELVES SUFFERED AND SEEN OTHERS SUFFER WERE NOT IN A HURRY TO CHOOSE
3340-170982-0047 AND HAD BEEN MODERATELY FORTUNATE IN THE NUMBER OF THE LOT HE MIGHT AS THE MESSENGER REPORTED BE HAPPY HERE AND ALSO HIS JOURNEY TO ANOTHER LIFE AND RETURN TO THIS INSTEAD OF BEING ROUGH AND UNDERGROUND WOULD BE SMOOTH AND HEAVENLY MOST CURIOUS HE SAID WAS THE SPECTACLE
3340-170982-0048 SAD AND LAUGHABLE AND STRANGE FOR THE CHOICE OF THE SOULS WAS IN MOST CASES BASED ON THEIR EXPERIENCE OF A PREVIOUS LIFE THERE HE SAW THE SOUL WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN ORPHEUS CHOOSING THE LIFE OF A SWAN OUT OF ENMITY TO THE RACE OF WOMEN
3340-170982-0049 HATING TO BE BORN OF A WOMAN BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN HIS MURDERERS HE BEHELD ALSO THE SOUL OF THAMYRAS CHOOSING THE LIFE OF A NIGHTINGALE BIRDS ON THE OTHER HAND LIKE THE SWAN AND OTHER MUSICIANS WANTING TO BE MEN
3340-170982-0050 WHO TOOK THE LIFE OF AN EAGLE BECAUSE LIKE AJAX HE HATED HUMAN NATURE BY REASON OF HIS SUFFERINGS ABOUT THE MIDDLE CAME THE LOT OF ATALANTA SHE SEEING THE GREAT FAME OF AN ATHLETE WAS UNABLE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION
3340-170982-0051 AND AFTER HER THERE FOLLOWED THE SOUL OF EPEUS THE SON OF PANOPEUS PASSING INTO THE NATURE OF A WOMAN CUNNING IN THE ARTS AND FAR AWAY AMONG THE LAST WHO CHOSE THE SOUL OF THE JESTER THERSITES WAS PUTTING ON THE FORM OF A MONKEY
3340-170982-0052 HE HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THIS WHICH WAS LYING ABOUT AND HAD BEEN NEGLECTED BY EVERYBODY ELSE AND WHEN HE SAW IT HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME HAD HIS LOT BEEN FIRST INSTEAD OF LAST AND THAT HE WAS DELIGHTED TO HAVE IT AND NOT ONLY DID MEN PASS INTO ANIMALS
3340-170982-0053 BUT I MUST ALSO MENTION THAT THERE WERE ANIMALS TAME AND WILD WHO CHANGED INTO ONE ANOTHER AND INTO CORRESPONDING HUMAN NATURES THE GOOD INTO THE GENTLE AND THE EVIL INTO THE SAVAGE IN ALL SORTS OF COMBINATIONS ALL THE SOULS HAD NOW CHOSEN THEIR LIVES
3340-170982-0054 AND THEY WENT IN THE ORDER OF THEIR CHOICE TO LACHESIS WHO SENT WITH THEM THE GENIUS WHOM THEY HAD SEVERALLY CHOSEN TO BE THE GUARDIAN OF THEIR LIVES AND THE FULFILLER OF THE CHOICE THIS GENIUS LED THE SOULS FIRST TO CLOTHO AND DREW THEM WITHIN THE REVOLUTION OF THE SPINDLE IMPELLED BY HER HAND
3340-170982-0055 WHENCE WITHOUT TURNING ROUND THEY PASSED BENEATH THE THRONE OF NECESSITY
3340-170982-0056 AND WHEN THEY HAD ALL PASSED THEY MARCHED ON IN A SCORCHING HEAT TO THE PLAIN OF FORGETFULNESS WHICH WAS A BARREN WASTE DESTITUTE OF TREES AND VERDURE AND THEN TOWARDS EVENING THEY ENCAMPED BY THE RIVER OF UNMINDFULNESS WHOSE WATER NO VESSEL CAN HOLD
3340-170982-0057 OF THIS THEY WERE ALL OBLIGED TO DRINK A CERTAIN QUANTITY AND THOSE WHO WERE NOT SAVED BY WISDOM DRANK MORE THAN WAS NECESSARY AND EACH ONE AS HE DRANK FORGOT ALL THINGS NOW AFTER THEY HAD GONE TO REST ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THERE WAS A THUNDERSTORM AND EARTHQUAKE
3340-170982-0058 AND WE SHALL PASS SAFELY OVER THE RIVER OF FORGETFULNESS AND OUR SOUL WILL NOT BE DEFILED WHEREFORE MY COUNSEL IS THAT WE HOLD FAST EVER TO THE HEAVENLY WAY AND FOLLOW AFTER JUSTICE AND VIRTUE ALWAYS
