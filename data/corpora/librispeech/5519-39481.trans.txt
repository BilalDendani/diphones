5519-39481-0000 ONE DAY HE TRIED TAKING WITH HIM THE STEREOSCOPE AND A PACK OF CARDS BUT THOUGH HIS SILVIA WAS AFFECTIONATE AND AMIABLE ENOUGH TO LET HIM PUT THE STEREOSCOPE OVER HER MUZZLE YET SHE WOULD NOT LOOK THROUGH IT BUT KEPT TURNING HER HEAD TO LICK HIS HAND
5519-39481-0001 IT WAS THE SAME TOO WITH THE CARDS FOR WITH THEM SHE WAS PLEASED ENOUGH BUT ONLY DELIGHTING TO BITE AT THEM
5519-39481-0002 AND NEVER CONSIDERING FOR A MOMENT WHETHER THEY WERE DIAMONDS OR CLUBS OR HEARTS OR SPADES OR WHETHER THE CARD WAS AN ACE OR NOT SO IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THE NATURE OF CARDS TOO THEREAFTER HE ONLY BROUGHT THEM THINGS WHICH SHE COULD BETTER ENJOY THAT IS SUGAR GRAPES
5519-39481-0003 RAISINS AND BUTCHER'S MEAT BY AND BYE AS THE SUMMER WORE ON THE CUBS CAME TO KNOW HIM AND HE THEM
5519-39481-0004 AND THEN HE CHRISTENED THEM FOR THIS PURPOSE HE BROUGHT A LITTLE BOWL OF WATER SPRINKLED THEM AS IF IN BAPTISM AND TOLD THEM HE WAS THEIR GODFATHER AND GAVE EACH OF THEM A NAME CALLING THEM SOREL KASPER SELWYN ESTHER AND ANGELICA
5519-39481-0005 SOREL WAS A CLUMSY LITTLE BEAST OF A CHEERY AND INDEED PUPPYISH DISPOSITION KASPER WAS FIERCE THE LARGEST OF THE FIVE EVEN IN HIS PLAY HE WOULD ALWAYS BITE
5519-39481-0006 ESTHER WAS OF A DARK COMPLEXION A TRUE BRUNETTE AND VERY STURDY ANGELICA THE BRIGHTEST RED AND THE MOST EXACTLY LIKE HER MOTHER WHILE SELWYN WAS THE SMALLEST CUB OF A VERY PRYING INQUISITIVE AND CUNNING TEMPER
5519-39481-0007 BUT DELICATE AND UNDERSIZED THUS MISTER TEBRICK HAD A WHOLE FAMILY NOW TO OCCUPY HIM AND INDEED CAME TO LOVE THEM WITH VERY MUCH OF A FATHER'S LOVE AND PARTIALITY HIS FAVOURITE WAS ANGELICA WHO REMINDED HIM SO MUCH OF HER MOTHER IN HER PRETTY WAYS
5519-39481-0008 BECAUSE OF A GENTLENESS WHICH WAS LACKING IN THE OTHERS EVEN IN THEIR PLAY AFTER HER IN HIS AFFECTIONS CAME SELWYN
5519-39481-0009 INDEED HE WAS SO MUCH MORE QUICK WITTED THAN THE REST THAT MISTER TEBRICK WAS LED INTO SPECULATING AS TO WHETHER HE HAD NOT INHERITED SOMETHING OF THE HUMAN FROM HIS DAM THUS VERY EARLY HE LEARNT TO KNOW HIS NAME
5519-39481-0010 BESIDES ALL THIS HE WAS SOMETHING OF A YOUNG PHILOSOPHER FOR THOUGH HIS BROTHER KASPER TYRANNIZED OVER HIM HE PUT UP WITH IT ALL WITH AN UNRUFFLED TEMPER HE WAS NOT HOWEVER ABOVE PLAYING TRICKS ON THE OTHERS
5519-39481-0011 AND ONE DAY WHEN MISTER TEBRICK WAS BY HE MADE BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A MOUSE IN A HOLE SOME LITTLE WAY OFF VERY SOON HE WAS JOINED BY SOREL AND PRESENTLY BY KASPER AND ESTHER WHEN HE HAD GOT THEM ALL DIGGING IT WAS EASY FOR HIM TO SLIP AWAY
5519-39481-0012 AND THEN HE CAME TO HIS GODFATHER WITH A SLY LOOK SAT DOWN BEFORE HIM AND SMILED AND THEN JERKED HIS HEAD OVER TOWARDS THE OTHERS AND SMILED AGAIN AND WRINKLED HIS BROWS SO THAT MISTER TEBRICK KNEW AS WELL AS IF HE HAD SPOKEN THAT THE YOUNGSTER WAS SAYING HAVE I NOT MADE FOOLS OF THEM ALL
5519-39481-0013 HE WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS CURIOUS ABOUT MISTER TEBRICK HE MADE HIM TAKE OUT HIS WATCH PUT HIS EAR TO IT CONSIDERED IT AND WRINKLED UP HIS BROWS IN PERPLEXITY ON THE NEXT VISIT IT WAS THE SAME THING HE MUST SEE THE WATCH AGAIN
5519-39481-0014 LITTLE SELWYN COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND IT AND IF HIS MOTHER REMEMBERED ANYTHING ABOUT WATCHES IT WAS A SUBJECT WHICH SHE NEVER ATTEMPTED TO EXPLAIN TO HER CHILDREN ONE DAY MISTER TEBRICK LEFT THE EARTH AS USUAL AND RAN DOWN THE SLOPE TO THE ROAD
5519-39481-0015 WHEN HE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND A CARRIAGE WAITING BEFORE HIS HOUSE AND A COACHMAN WALKING ABOUT NEAR HIS GATE MISTER TEBRICK WENT IN AND FOUND THAT HIS VISITOR WAS WAITING FOR HIM IT WAS HIS WIFE'S UNCLE
5519-39481-0016 AND MISTER TEBRICK LED HIM INTO THE HOUSE THE CLERGYMAN LOOKED ABOUT HIM A GOOD DEAL AT THE DIRTY AND DISORDERLY ROOMS
5519-39481-0017 THE DUST LAY SO THICKLY ON ALL THE FURNITURE
5519-39481-0018 I HAVE CALLED REALLY TO ASK ABOUT MY NIECE
5519-39481-0019 SHE IS QUITE HAPPY NOW AH INDEED I HAVE HEARD SHE IS NOT LIVING WITH YOU ANY LONGER NO SHE IS NOT LIVING WITH ME SHE IS NOT FAR AWAY I SEE HER EVERY DAY NOW INDEED WHERE DOES SHE LIVE
5519-39481-0020 IN THE WOODS WITH HER CHILDREN I OUGHT TO TELL YOU THAT SHE HAS CHANGED HER SHAPE SHE IS A FOX
5519-39481-0021 HE WAS ALARMED AND EVERYTHING MISTER TEBRICK SAID CONFIRMED WHAT HE HAD BEEN LED TO EXPECT HE WOULD FIND AT RYLANDS WHEN HE WAS OUTSIDE HOWEVER HE ASKED MISTER TEBRICK YOU DON'T HAVE MANY VISITORS NOW EH NO I NEVER SEE ANYONE IF I CAN AVOID IT
5519-39481-0022 YOU ARE THE FIRST PERSON I HAVE SPOKEN TO FOR MONTHS QUITE RIGHT TOO MY DEAR FELLOW I QUITE UNDERSTAND IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THEN THE CLERIC SHOOK HIM BY THE HAND GOT INTO HIS CARRIAGE AND DROVE AWAY
5519-39481-0023 HE WAS RELIEVED ALSO BECAUSE MISTER TEBRICK HAD SAID NOTHING ABOUT GOING ABROAD TO DISSEMINATE THE GOSPEL CANON FOX HAD BEEN ALARMED BY THE LETTER HAD NOT ANSWERED IT AND THOUGHT THAT IT WAS ALWAYS BETTER TO LET THINGS BE AND NEVER TO REFER TO ANYTHING UNPLEASANT
5519-39481-0024 HE DID NOT AT ALL WANT TO RECOMMEND MISTER TEBRICK TO THE BIBLE SOCIETY IF HE WERE MAD HIS ECCENTRICITIES WOULD NEVER BE NOTICED AT STOKOE BESIDES THAT MISTER TEBRICK HAD SAID HE WAS HAPPY HE WAS SORRY FOR MISTER TEBRICK TOO
5519-39481-0025 NOT AN AFFECTIONATE DISPOSITION THEN TO HIS COACHMAN NO THAT'S ALL RIGHT DRIVE ON HOPKINS WHEN MISTER TEBRICK WAS ALONE HE REJOICED EXCEEDINGLY IN HIS SOLITARY LIFE HE UNDERSTOOD OR SO HE FANCIED WHAT IT WAS TO BE HAPPY
5519-39481-0026 AND THAT HE HAD FOUND COMPLETE HAPPINESS NOW LIVING FROM DAY TO DAY CARELESS OF THE FUTURE SURROUNDED EVERY MORNING BY PLAYFUL AND AFFECTIONATE LITTLE CREATURES WHOM HE LOVED TENDERLY AND SITTING BESIDE THEIR MOTHER WHOSE SIMPLE HAPPINESS WAS THE SOURCE OF HIS OWN TRUE HAPPINESS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
5519-39481-0027 THERE IS NO SUCH HAPPINESS AS THAT OF THE MOTHER FOR HER BABE UNLESS I HAVE ATTAINED IT IN MINE FOR MY VIXEN AND HER CHILDREN WITH THESE FEELINGS HE WAITED IMPATIENTLY FOR THE HOUR ON THE MORROW WHEN HE MIGHT HASTEN TO THEM ONCE MORE
5519-39481-0028 WHEN HOWEVER HE HAD TOILED UP THE HILLSIDE TO THE EARTH TAKING INFINITE PRECAUTION NOT TO TREAD DOWN THE BRACKEN OR MAKE A BEATEN PATH WHICH MIGHT LEAD OTHERS TO THAT SECRET SPOT
5519-39481-0029 AND THAT THERE WERE NO CUBS TO BE SEEN EITHER
5519-39481-0030 FOR A LONG WHILE AS IT SEEMED TO HIM HE LAY VERY STILL WITH CLOSED EYES STRAINING HIS EARS TO HEAR EVERY RUSTLE AMONG THE LEAVES OR ANY SOUND THAT MIGHT BE THE CUBS STIRRING IN THE EARTH AT LAST HE MUST HAVE DROPPED ASLEEP FOR HE WOKE SUDDENLY WITH ALL HIS SENSES ALERT
5519-39481-0031 AND OPENING HIS EYES FOUND A FULL GROWN FOX WITHIN SIX FEET OF HIM SITTING ON ITS HAUNCHES LIKE A DOG AND WATCHING HIS FACE WITH CURIOSITY MISTER TEBRICK SAW INSTANTLY THAT IT WAS NOT SILVIA WHEN HE MOVED THE FOX GOT UP AND SHIFTED HIS EYES BUT STILL STOOD HIS GROUND
5519-39481-0032 HERE WAS THE REAL FATHER OF HIS GODCHILDREN WHO COULD BE CERTAIN OF THEIR TAKING AFTER HIM AND LEADING OVER AGAIN HIS WILD AND RAKISH LIFE MISTER TEBRICK STARED FOR A LONG TIME AT THE HANDSOME ROGUE WHO GLANCED BACK AT HIM WITH DISTRUST AND WATCHFULNESS PATENT IN HIS FACE
5519-39481-0033 BUT NOT WITHOUT DEFIANCE TOO AND IT SEEMED TO MISTER TEBRICK AS IF THERE WAS ALSO A TOUCH OF CYNICAL HUMOUR IN HIS LOOK AS IF HE SAID BY GAD WE TWO HAVE BEEN STRANGELY BROUGHT TOGETHER AND TO THE MAN AT ANY RATE IT SEEMED STRANGE THAT THEY WERE THUS LINKED
5519-39481-0034 AND HE WONDERED IF THE LOVE HIS RIVAL THERE BARE TO HIS VIXEN AND HIS CUBS WERE THE SAME THING IN KIND AS HIS OWN
5519-39481-0035 WE BOTH OF US ARE HAPPY CHIEFLY IN THEIR COMPANY WHAT PRIDE THIS FELLOW MUST FEEL TO HAVE SUCH A WIFE AND SUCH CHILDREN TAKING AFTER HIM AND HAS HE NOT REASON FOR HIS PRIDE HE LIVES IN A WORLD WHERE HE IS BESET WITH A THOUSAND DANGERS
5519-39481-0036 FOR HALF THE YEAR HE IS HUNTED EVERYWHERE DOGS PURSUE HIM MEN LAY TRAPS FOR HIM OR MENACE HIM HE OWES NOTHING TO ANOTHER BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK
5519-39481-0037 AND THEN HE TROTTED OFF AS LIGHTLY AS A GOSSAMER VEIL BLOWN IN THE WIND AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO MORE BACK HE COMES WITH HIS VIXEN AND THE CUBS ALL AROUND HIM SEEING THE DOG FOX THUS SURROUNDED BY VIXEN AND CUBS WAS TOO MUCH FOR MISTER TEBRICK
5519-39481-0038 IN SPITE OF ALL HIS PHILOSOPHY A PANG OF JEALOUSY SHOT THROUGH HIM HE COULD SEE THAT SILVIA HAD BEEN HUNTING WITH HER CUBS AND ALSO THAT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THAT HE WOULD COME THAT MORNING FOR SHE STARTED WHEN SHE SAW HIM AND THOUGH SHE CARELESSLY LICKED HIS HAND HE COULD SEE THAT HER THOUGHTS WERE NOT WITH HIM
5519-39481-0039 VERY SOON SHE LED HER CUBS INTO THE EARTH THE DOG FOX HAD VANISHED AND MISTER TEBRICK WAS AGAIN ALONE HE DID NOT WAIT LONGER BUT WENT HOME NOW WAS HIS PEACE OF MIND ALL GONE THE HAPPINESS WHICH HE HAD FLATTERED HIMSELF THE NIGHT BEFORE HE KNEW SO WELL HOW TO ENJOY
5519-39481-0040 A HUNDRED TIMES THIS POOR GENTLEMAN BIT HIS LIP DREW DOWN HIS TORVOUS BROWS AND STAMPED HIS FOOT AND CURSED HIMSELF BITTERLY OR CALLED HIS LADY BITCH HE COULD NOT FORGIVE HIMSELF NEITHER THAT HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THE DAMNED DOG FOX BEFORE
5519-39481-0041 BUT ALL THE WHILE HAD LET THE CUBS FRISK ROUND HIM EACH ONE A PROOF THAT A DOG FOX HAD BEEN AT WORK WITH HIS VIXEN YES JEALOUSY WAS NOW IN THE WIND AND EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HAD BEEN A REASON FOR HIS FELICITY THE NIGHT BEFORE WAS NOW TURNED INTO A MONSTROUS FEATURE OF HIS NIGHTMARE
5519-39481-0042 WITH ALL THIS MISTER TEBRICK SO WORKED UPON HIMSELF THAT FOR THE TIME BEING HE HAD LOST HIS REASON
5519-39481-0043 ALL THAT NIGHT HE WAS IN THIS MOOD AND IN AGONY
