7713-106729-0000 FIRELIGHT WHAT A CHARM IT ADDS TO STORY TELLING HOW ITS MOODS SEEM TO KEEP PACE WITH SITUATIONS PICTURED BY THE ORACLE OFFERING SHADOWS WHEN DREAD IS ABROAD
7713-106729-0001 AND LIGHT WHEN A PLEASING CLIMAX IS REACHED FOR INTEREST UNDOUBTEDLY TENDS THE BLAZE WHILE SYMPATHY CONTRIBUTES OR WITHHOLDS FUEL ACCORDING TO ITS DICTATES THE LODGE WAS ALIGHT WHEN I APPROACHED
7713-106729-0002 AND I COULD HEAR THE CHILDREN SINGING IN A HAPPY MOOD BUT UPON ENTERING THE SINGING CEASED AND EMBARRASSED SMILES ON THE YOUNG FACES GREETED ME NOR COULD I COAX A CONTINUATION OF THE SONG SEATED BESIDE WAR EAGLE
7713-106729-0003 WAS A VERY OLD INDIAN WHOSE NAME WAS RED ROBE AND AS SOON AS I WAS SEATED THE HOST EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS AN HONORED GUEST THAT HE WAS A SIOUX AND A FRIEND OF LONG STANDING THEN WAR EAGLE LIGHTED THE PIPE
7713-106729-0004 PASSING IT TO THE DISTINGUISHED FRIEND WHO IN TURN PASSED IT TO ME AFTER FIRST OFFERING IT TO THE SUN THE FATHER AND THE EARTH THE MOTHER OF ALL THAT IS
7713-106729-0005 IN A LODGE OF THE BLACKFEET THE PIPE MUST NEVER BE PASSED ACROSS THE DOORWAY TO DO SO WOULD INSULT THE HOST AND BRING BAD LUCK TO ALL WHO ASSEMBLED THEREFORE IF THERE BE A LARGE NUMBER OF GUESTS RANGED ABOUT THE LODGE
7713-106729-0006 ONCE THE MOON MADE THE SUN A PAIR OF LEGGINGS SUCH BEAUTIFUL WORK HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE THEY WERE WORKED WITH THE COLORED QUILLS OF THE PORCUPINE AND WERE COVERED WITH STRANGE SIGNS WHICH NONE BUT THE SUN AND THE MOON COULD READ
7713-106729-0007 AND IT TOOK THE MOON MANY SNOWS TO MAKE THEM YES THEY WERE WONDERFUL LEGGINGS AND THE SUN ALWAYS WORE THEM ON FINE DAYS FOR THEY WERE BRIGHT TO LOOK UPON EVERY NIGHT WHEN THE SUN WENT TO SLEEP IN HIS LODGE AWAY IN THE WEST
7713-106729-0008 WHEN HE WORKED HE ALMOST ALWAYS WORE THEM AS I HAVE TOLD YOU SO THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER OF LOSING THEM IN THE DAYTIME BUT THE SUN WAS CAREFUL OF HIS LEGGINGS WHEN NIGHT CAME AND HE SLEPT
7713-106729-0009 YOU WOULDN'T THINK THAT A PERSON WOULD BE SO FOOLISH AS TO STEAL FROM THE SUN BUT ONE NIGHT OLD MAN WHO IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO EVER KNEW JUST WHERE THE SUN'S LODGE WAS CREPT NEAR ENOUGH TO LOOK IN
7713-106729-0010 AND SAW THE LEGGINGS UNDER THE SUN'S HEAD WE HAVE ALL TRAVELLED A GREAT DEAL BUT NO MAN EVER FOUND THE SUN'S LODGE NO MAN KNOWS IN WHAT COUNTRY IT IS OF COURSE WE KNOW IT IS LOCATED SOMEWHERE WEST OF HERE
7713-106729-0011 FOR WE SEE HIM GOING THAT WAY EVERY AFTERNOON BUT OLD MAN KNEW EVERYTHING EXCEPT THAT HE COULD NOT FOOL THE SUN YES OLD MAN LOOKED INTO THE LODGE OF THE SUN AND SAW THE LEGGINGS THERE
7713-106729-0012 SAW THE SUN TOO AND THE SUN WAS ASLEEP HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD STEAL THE LEGGINGS SO HE CREPT THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE LODGE THERE WAS NO ONE AT HOME BUT THE SUN FOR THE MOON HAS WORK TO DO AT NIGHT JUST AS THE CHILDREN THE STARS DO
7713-106729-0013 SO HE THOUGHT HE COULD SLIP THE LEGGINGS FROM UNDER THE SLEEPER'S HEAD AND GET AWAY HE GOT DOWN ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES TO WALK LIKE THE BEAR PEOPLE AND CREPT INTO THE LODGE BUT IN THE BLACK DARKNESS
7713-106729-0014 HE PUT HIS KNEE UPON A DRY STICK NEAR THE SUN'S BED THE STICK SNAPPED UNDER HIS WEIGHT WITH SO GREAT A NOISE THAT THE SUN TURNED OVER AND SNORTED SCARING OLD MAN SO BADLY THAT HE COULDN'T MOVE FOR A MINUTE HIS HEART WAS NOT STRONG
7713-106729-0015 WICKEDNESS MAKES EVERY HEART WEAKER AND AFTER MAKING SURE THAT THE SUN HAD NOT SEEN HIM HE CREPT SILENTLY OUT OF THE LODGE AND RAN AWAY ON THE TOP OF A HILL OLD MAN STOPPED TO LOOK AND LISTEN BUT ALL WAS STILL
7713-106729-0016 SO HE SAT DOWN AND THOUGHT I'LL GET THEM TO MORROW NIGHT WHEN HE SLEEPS AGAIN HE SAID TO HIMSELF I NEED THOSE LEGGINGS MYSELF AND I'M GOING TO GET THEM BECAUSE THEY WILL MAKE ME HANDSOME AS THE SUN
7713-106729-0017 HE WATCHED THE MOON COME HOME TO CAMP AND SAW THE SUN GO TO WORK BUT HE DID NOT GO VERY FAR AWAY BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BE NEAR THE LODGE WHEN NIGHT CAME AGAIN
7713-106729-0018 AND ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE WORK TO DO MEASURE TIME HE WAS CLOSE TO THE LODGE WHEN THE MOON CAME OUT AND THERE HE WAITED UNTIL THE SUN WENT INSIDE FROM THE BUSHES OLD MAN SAW THE SUN TAKE OFF HIS LEGGINGS
7713-106729-0019 AND HIS EYES GLITTERED WITH GREED AS HE SAW THEIR OWNER FOLD THEM AND PUT THEM UNDER HIS HEAD AS HE HAD ALWAYS DONE THEN HE WAITED A WHILE BEFORE CREEPING CLOSER LITTLE BY LITTLE THE OLD RASCAL CRAWLED TOWARD THE LODGE
7713-106729-0020 TILL FINALLY HIS HEAD WAS INSIDE THE DOOR THEN HE WAITED A LONG LONG TIME EVEN AFTER THE SUN WAS SNORING THE STRANGE NOISES OF THE NIGHT BOTHERED HIM FOR HE KNEW HE WAS DOING WRONG
7713-106729-0021 AND WHEN A LOON CRIED ON A LAKE NEAR BY HE SHIVERED AS WITH COLD
7713-106729-0022 WITHOUT WAKING THE SUN HIS BREATH WAS SHORT AND HIS HEART WAS BEATING AS A WAR DRUM BEATS
7713-106729-0023 COLD SWEAT THAT GREAT FEAR ALWAYS BRINGS TO THE WEAK HEARTED WAS DRIPPING FROM HIS BODY AND ONCE
7713-106729-0024 BUT GREED WHISPERED AGAIN AND LISTENING TO ITS VOICE HE STOLE THE LEGGINGS FROM UNDER THE SUN'S HEAD CAREFULLY
7713-106729-0025 HE WASTED MUCH BREATH LAUGHING AT HIS SMARTNESS AS HE RAN AND SOON HE GREW TIRED HO HE SAID TO HIMSELF I AM FAR ENOUGH NOW AND I SHALL SLEEP IT'S EASY TO STEAL FROM THE SUN
7713-106729-0026 OLD MAN SAT UP AND THERE WAS THE SUN LOOKING RIGHT IN HIS FACE AND LAUGHING HE WAS FRIGHTENED AND RAN AWAY LEAVING THE LEGGINGS BEHIND HIM LAUGHINGLY THE SUN PUT ON THE LEGGINGS
7713-106729-0027 AND WENT ON TOWARD THE WEST FOR HE IS ALWAYS BUSY HE THOUGHT HE WOULD SEE OLD MAN NO MORE BUT IT TAKES MORE THAN ONE LESSON TO TEACH A FOOL TO BE WISE AND OLD MAN
7713-106729-0028 THEN HE RAN WESTWARD AND HID HIMSELF NEAR THE SUN'S LODGE AGAIN INTENDING TO WAIT FOR THE NIGHT AND STEAL THE LEGGINGS
7713-106729-0029 HE WAS MUCH AFRAID THIS TIME BUT AS SOON AS THE SUN WAS ASLEEP HE CREPT TO THE LODGE AND PEEKED INSIDE HERE HE STOPPED AND LOOKED ABOUT
7713-106729-0030 FOR HE WAS AFRAID THE SUN WOULD HEAR HIS HEART BEATING FINALLY HE STARTED TOWARD THE SUN'S BED AND JUST THEN
7713-106729-0031 AND THIS SCARED HIM MORE FOR THAT IS VERY BAD LUCK AND HE KNEW IT BUT HE KEPT ON CREEPING UNTIL HE COULD ALMOST TOUCH THE SUN ALL ABOUT THE LODGE WERE BEAUTIFUL LININGS TANNED AND PAINTED BY THE MOON AND THE QUEER SIGNS ON THEM
7713-106729-0032 MADE THE OLD COWARD TREMBLE HE HEARD A NIGHT BIRD CALL OUTSIDE AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SURELY WAKE THE SUN SO HE HASTENED TO THE BED AND WITH CUNNING FINGERS STOLE THE LEGGINGS AS HE HAD DONE THE NIGHT BEFORE
7713-106729-0033 WITHOUT WAKING THE GREAT SLEEPER THEN HE CREPT OUT OF THE LODGE TALKING BRAVELY TO HIMSELF AS COWARDS DO WHEN THEY ARE AFRAID NOW HE SAID TO HIMSELF I SHALL RUN FASTER AND FARTHER THAN BEFORE
7713-106729-0034 WHEN DAY BEGAN TO BREAK OLD MAN WAS FAR FROM THE SUN'S LODGE AND HE HID HIMSELF IN A DEEP GULCH AMONG SOME BUSHES THAT GREW THERE HE LISTENED A LONG TIME BEFORE HE DARED TO GO TO SLEEP BUT FINALLY HE DID
7713-106729-0035 HE WAS TIRED FROM HIS GREAT RUN AND SLEPT SOUNDLY AND FOR A LONG TIME BUT WHEN HE OPENED HIS EYES THERE WAS THE SUN LOOKING STRAIGHT AT HIM AND THIS TIME HE WAS SCOWLING
7713-106729-0036 OLD MAN STARTED TO RUN AWAY BUT THE SUN GRABBED HIM AND THREW HIM DOWN UPON HIS BACK MY BUT THE SUN WAS ANGRY AND HE SAID OLD MAN YOU ARE A CLEVER THIEF BUT A MIGHTY FOOL AS WELL
7713-106729-0037 FOR YOU STEAL FROM ME AND EXPECT TO HIDE AWAY TWICE YOU HAVE STOLEN THE LEGGINGS MY WIFE MADE FOR ME AND TWICE I HAVE FOUND YOU EASILY DON'T YOU KNOW THAT THE WHOLE WORLD IS MY LODGE AND THAT YOU CAN NEVER GET OUTSIDE OF IT IF YOU RUN
7713-106729-0038 YOUR FOOLISH LEGS OFF DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I LIGHT ALL OF MY LODGE EVERY DAY AND SEARCH IT CAREFULLY DON'T YOU KNOW THAT NOTHING CAN HIDE FROM ME AND LIVE I SHALL NOT HARM YOU THIS TIME BUT I WARN YOU NOW THAT IF YOU EVER STEAL FROM ME AGAIN I WILL HURT YOU BADLY
7713-106729-0039 NOW GO AND DON'T LET ME CATCH YOU STEALING AGAIN AWAY WENT OLD MAN AND ON TOWARD THE WEST WENT THE BUSY SUN THAT IS ALL
