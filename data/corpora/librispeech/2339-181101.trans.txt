2339-181101-0000 CHAPTER TEN EVERARD GREY UNCLE JULIUS HAD TAKEN A RUN DOWN TO SYDNEY BEFORE RETURNING TO CADDAGAT
2339-181101-0001 HE WAS GRANDMAMMA'S ADOPTED SON AND WAS THE ORPHAN OF VERY ARISTOCRATIC ENGLISH PARENTS WHO HAD LEFT HIM TO THE GUARDIANSHIP OF DISTANT RELATIVES THEY HAD PROVED CRIMINALLY UNSCRUPULOUS BY FINDING A FLAW IN DEEDS OR SOMETHING WHICH NONE BUT LAWYERS UNDERSTAND
2339-181101-0002 THEY HAD DEPRIVED HIM OF ALL HIS PROPERTY AND LEFT HIM TO SINK OR SWIM GRANNIE HAD DISCOVERED REARED AND EDUCATED HIM AMONG PROFESSIONS HE HAD CHOSEN THE BAR AND WAS NOW ONE OF SYDNEY'S MOST PROMISING YOUNG BARRISTERS
2339-181101-0003 HIS FOSTER MOTHER WAS NO END PROUD OF HIM AND LOVED HIM AS HER OWN SON IN DUE TIME A TELEGRAM ARRIVED FROM UNCLE JULIUS
2339-181101-0004 BY THIS TIME I HAD QUITE RECOVERED FROM INFLUENZA AND MY ACCIDENT AND AS THEY WOULD NOT ARRIVE TILL NEAR NIGHTFALL
2339-181101-0005 ALSO I WAS TO BE FAVOURED WITH A LOOK AT MY REFLECTION IN A MIRROR FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE MY ARRIVAL
2339-181101-0006 AND MEETING MISTER HAWDEN SOME DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE HE TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO ACCOMPANY ME EVERYWHERE I WENT HE FOLLOWED AFTER MUCH TO MY ANNOYANCE BECAUSE GRANNIE GAVE ME MANY AND SERIOUS TALKINGS TO ABOUT THE CRIME OF ENCOURAGING YOUNG MEN
2339-181101-0007 FRANK HAWDEN HAD CHANGED HIS TUNE AND TOLD ME NOW THAT IT MATTERED NOT THAT I WAS NOT PRETTY AS PRETTY OR NOT I WAS THE GREATEST BRICK OF A GIRL HE HAD MET
2339-181101-0008 AND BECAUSE HE HAD ARRIVED AT THAT OVERFLOWING AGE WHEN YOUNG MEN HAVE TO BE PARTIAL TO SOME FEMALE WHETHER SHE BE UGLY OR PRETTY FAT OR LEAN OLD OR YOUNG THAT I SHOULD BE THE OBJECT OF THESE PUERILE EMOTIONS IN A FELLOW LIKE FRANK HAWDEN
2339-181101-0009 FILLED ME WITH LOATHING AND DISGUST IT WAS LATE IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN HAWDEN AND I RETURNED
2339-181101-0010 APPROACHING AT THE GOING FOR THE DOCTOR PACE AT WHICH UNCLE JULIUS ALWAYS DROVE AUNT HELEN HUSTLED ME OFF TO DRESS BUT I WAS ONLY HALF RIGGED WHEN THEY ARRIVED AND SO WAS UNABLE TO GO OUT AND MEET THEM UNCLE JULIUS INQUIRED FOR THAT YOUNGSTER OF LUCY'S AND AUNT HELEN REPLIED THAT SHE WOULD BE FORTHCOMING
2339-181101-0011 UNCLE JULIUS SAID AND AUNTIE HELEN CAME TO FINISH MY TOILET WHILE THEY WERE MAKING THEIRS THERE NOW YOU HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF IN THE WAY OF LOOKS SHE REMARKED AT THE COMPLETION OF THE CEREMONY
2339-181101-0012 I WAS DECKED IN MY FIRST EVENING DRESS AS IT WAS A GREAT OCCASION
2339-181101-0013 WHAT CAN BE MORE FOOLISH THAN TO ENDANGER ONE'S HEALTH BY EXPOSING AT NIGHT THE CHEST AND ARMS TWO OF THE MOST VITAL SPOTS OF THE BODY WHICH HAVE BEEN COVERED ALL DAY ON THE OTHER HAND WHAT CAN BE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN A SOFT WHITE BOSOM RISING AND FALLING AMID A DAINTY NEST OF SILK AND LACE
2339-181101-0014 EVERY WOMAN LOOKS MORE SOFT AND FEMININE IN A DECOLLETE GOWN AND IS THERE ANY OF THE ANIMAL LINES KNOWN PLEASANTER TO THE EYE THAN THE CONTOUR OF SHAPELY ARMS SOME THERE ARE WHO CRY DOWN EVENING DRESS AS BEING IMMODEST AND INDECENT
2339-181101-0015 A HEAVY LAMP WAS ON EACH OF THE FOUR BRACKETS IN THE CORNERS
2339-181101-0016 AND CANDELABRA THREW MANY LIGHTS FROM THE PIANO
2339-181101-0017 BUT WE NEVER LIGHTED MORE THAN A SINGLE CANDLE ON THE PIANO THIS HAD BEEN AMPLE LIGHT FOR OUR PURPOSE AUNT HELEN WOULD SING IN HER SWEET SAD VOICE ALL THE BEAUTIFUL OLD SONGS I LOVED WHILE I CURLED MYSELF ON A MAT AT HER SIDE AND READ BOOKS THE MUSIC OFTEN COMPELLING ME TO FORGET THE READING
2339-181101-0018 BUT THROUGH BOTH EVER CAME THE SOLEMN RUSH OF THE STREAM OUTSIDE IN ITS WEIRD MELANCHOLY LIKE A WIND CEASELESSLY ENDEAVOURING TO OUTSTRIP A WILD VAIN REGRET WHICH RELENTLESSLY PURSUED YOUR UNCLE JULIUS ALWAYS HAS THE DRAWING ROOM LIGHTED LIKE THIS

2339-181101-0020 BUT THIS EVENING THE BLUE SILKEN CURTAINS WERE LOOPED UP AND IT WAS BEFORE THIS THAT I STOOD I LOOKED AND LOOKED AGAIN IN PLEASED SURPRISE I BEHELD A YOUNG GIRL WITH EYES AND SKIN OF THE CLEAREST AND BRIGHTEST AND LIPS OF BRILLIANT SCARLET
2339-181101-0021 AND A CHEST AND PAIR OF ARMS WHICH WOULD PASS MUSTER WITH THE BEST IF NATURE HAD BEEN IN BAD HUMOUR WHEN MOULDING MY FACE SHE HAD USED HER TOOLS CRAFTILY IN FORMING MY FIGURE AUNT HELEN HAD PROVED A CLEVER MAID AND DRESSMAKER
2339-181101-0022 MY PALE BLUE CASHMERE DRESS FITTED MY FULLY DEVELOPED YET GIRLISH FIGURE TO PERFECTION
2339-181101-0023 THE REMAINDER TIED SIMPLY WITH A PIECE OF RIBBON HUNG IN THICK WAVES NEARLY TO MY KNEES MY TOILET HAD ALTERED ME ALMOST BEYOND RECOGNITION IT MADE ME LOOK MY AGE SIXTEEN YEARS AND TEN MONTHS WHEREAS BEFORE
