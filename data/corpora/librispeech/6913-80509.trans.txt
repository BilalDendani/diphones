6913-80509-0002 EVERY OMNIBUS THAT CLATTERED BY WAS HEAVILY LADEN WITH PASSENGERS TARPAULINS GLEAMED OVER THE KNEES OF THOSE WHO SAT OUTSIDE THIS WAY AND THAT THE LIGHTS WERE BLURRED INTO A MISTY RADIANCE OVERHEAD WAS MERE BLACKNESS WHENCE DESCENDED THE LASHING RAIN
6913-80509-0003 THERE WAS A CEASELESS SCATTERING OF MUD THERE WERE BLOCKS IN THE TRAFFIC ATTENDED WITH ROUGH JEST OR ANGRY CURSE THERE WAS JOSTLING ON THE CROWDED PAVEMENT PUBLIC HOUSES BEGAN TO BRIGHTEN UP TO BESTIR THEMSELVES FOR THE EVENING'S BUSINESS
6913-80509-0004 BEING ABANDONED TO SILENCE AND DARKNESS AND THE SWEEPING WIND AT NOON TO DAY THERE WAS SUNLIGHT ON THE SURREY HILLS THE FIELDS AND LANES WERE FRAGRANT WITH THE FIRST BREATH OF SPRING AND FROM THE SHELTER OF BUDDING COPSES
6913-80509-0005 MANY A PRIMROSE LOOKED TREMBLINGLY UP TO THE VISION OF BLUE SKY BUT OF THESE THINGS CLERKENWELL TAKES NO COUNT HERE IT HAD BEEN A DAY LIKE ANY OTHER CONSISTING OF SO MANY HOURS EACH REPRESENTING A FRACTION OF THE WEEKLY WAGE
6913-80509-0006 IT IS NOT AS IN THOSE PARTS OF LONDON WHERE THE MAIN THOROUGHFARES CONSIST OF SHOPS AND WAREHOUSES AND WORKROOMS
6913-80509-0007 HIDDEN AWAY ON EITHER HAND ARE DEVOTED IN THE MAIN TO DWELLINGS
6913-80509-0008 ALL BUT EVERY DOOR AND WINDOW EXHIBITS THE ADVERTISEMENT OF A CRAFT THAT IS CARRIED ON WITHIN HERE YOU MAY SEE HOW MEN HAVE MULTIPLIED TOIL FOR TOIL'S SAKE HAVE WROUGHT TO DEVISE WORK SUPERFLUOUS HAVE WORN THEIR LIVES AWAY IN IMAGINING NEW FORMS OF WEARINESS
6913-80509-0009 WHO STRAIN THEIR EYESIGHT WHO OVERTAX THEIR MUSCLES WHO NURSE DISEASE IN THEIR FRAMES WHO PUT RESOLUTELY FROM THEM THE THOUGHT OF WHAT EXISTENCE MIGHT BE
6913-80509-0010 OTHER CREATURES TO STRIVE WITH THEM FOR BREAD
6913-80509-0011 WORKERS IN METAL WORKERS IN GLASS AND IN ENAMEL WORKERS IN WEED WORKERS IN EVERY SUBSTANCE ON EARTH OR FROM THE WATERS UNDER THE EARTH THAT CAN BE MADE COMMERCIALLY VALUABLE IN CLERKENWELL THE DEMAND IS NOT SO MUCH FOR RUDE STRENGTH AS FOR THE CUNNING FINGERS AND THE CONTRIVING BRAIN
6913-80509-0012 THE INSCRIPTIONS ON THE HOUSE FRONTS WOULD MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE IN A REGION OF GOLD AND SILVER AND PRECIOUS STONES
6913-80509-0013 CRAFTSMEN ARE FOR EVER HANDLING JEWELLERY SHAPING BRIGHT ORNAMENTS FOR THE NECKS AND ARMS OF SUCH AS ARE BORN TO THE JOY OF LIFE WEALTH INESTIMABLE IS EVER FLOWING THROUGH THESE WORKSHOPS AND THE HANDS THAT HAVE BEEN STAINED WITH GOLD DUST MAY

6913-80509-0015 YET SOMEHOW THE HEART GROWS HEAVY SOMEHOW THE BLOOD IS TROUBLED IN ITS COURSE AND THE PULSES BEGIN TO THROB HOTLY AMID THE CROWDS OF WORKPEOPLE JANE SNOWDON MADE WHAT SPEED SHE MIGHT IT WAS HER CUSTOM WHENEVER DISPATCHED ON AN ERRAND TO RUN TILL SHE COULD RUN NO LONGER
6913-80509-0016 THEN TO HASTEN ALONG PANTING UNTIL BREATH AND STRENGTH WERE RECOVERED WHEN IT WAS EITHER OF THE PECKOVERS WHO SENT HER SHE KNEW THAT REPRIMAND WAS INEVITABLE ON HER RETURN BE SHE EVER SO SPEEDY BUT HER NATURE WAS INCAPABLE ALIKE OF REBELLION
6913-80509-0017 SHE DID NOT SERVE HER TYRANTS WITH WILLINGNESS FOR THEIR BRUTALITY FILLED HER WITH A SENSE OF INJUSTICE YET THE FACT THAT SHE WAS UTTERLY DEPENDENT UPON THEM FOR HER LIVELIHOOD THAT BUT FOR THEIR GRACE AS THEY WERE PERPETUALLY REMINDING HER SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN A WORKHOUSE CHILD
6913-80509-0018 HAD A MITIGATING EFFECT UPON THE BITTERNESS SHE COULD NOT WHOLLY SUBDUE THERE WAS HOWEVER ANOTHER REASON WHY SHE SPED EAGERLY ON HER PRESENT MISSION THE MAN TO WHOM SHE WAS CONVEYING MISSUS HEWETT'S MESSAGE WAS ONE OF THE VERY FEW PERSONS WHO HAD EVER TREATED HER WITH HUMAN KINDNESS
6913-80509-0019 SHE HAD KNOWN HIM BY NAME AND BY SIGHT FOR SOME YEARS AND SINCE HER MOTHER'S DEATH SHE WAS ELEVEN WHEN THAT HAPPENED HE HAD BY DEGREES GROWN TO REPRESENT ALL THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD BY THE WORD FRIEND IT WAS SELDOM THAT WORDS WERE EXCHANGED BETWEEN THEM
6913-80509-0020 THE OPPORTUNITY CAME SCARCELY OFTENER THAN ONCE A MONTH BUT WHENEVER IT DID COME IT MADE A BRIGHT MOMENT IN HER EXISTENCE ONCE BEFORE SHE HAD FETCHED HIM OF AN EVENING TO SEE MISSUS HEWETT AND AS THEY WALKED TOGETHER HE HAD SPOKEN WITH WHAT SEEMED TO HER WONDERFUL GENTLENESS
6913-80509-0021 WELL DRESSED AND WELL TO DO IN THE WORLD PERHAPS HE WOULD SPEAK IN THE SAME WAY TO NIGHT THE THOUGHT OF IT MADE HER REGARDLESS OF THE COLD RAIN THAT WAS DRENCHING HER MISERABLE GARMENT OF THE WIND THAT NOW AND THEN AS SHE TURNED A CORNER TOOK AWAY HER BREATH AND MADE HER CEASE FROM RUNNING
6913-80509-0022 H LEWIS WORKING JEWELLER IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE THAT THE MEN HAD ALREADY LEFT SHE WAITED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES WITH ANXIOUS MIND

6913-80509-0024 HE SEEMED TO BE ABSENT MINDED AND FOR SOME HUNDRED YARDS DISTANCE WAS SILENT THEN HE STOPPED OF A SUDDEN AND LOOKED DOWN AT HIS COMPANION WHY JANE HE SAID
6913-80509-0025 HE TOUCHED HER DRESS I THOUGHT SO YOU'RE WET THROUGH THERE FOLLOWED AN INARTICULATE GROWL AND IMMEDIATELY HE STRIPPED OFF HIS SHORT OVERCOAT
6913-80509-0026 JANE FELT HER HEART SINKING
6913-80509-0027 AND THAT SIDNEY KIRKWOOD MIGHT REASONABLY BE ANXIOUS TO GET OVER THE GROUND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
6913-80509-0028 STILL POORLY EH AND THE BABY THEN HE WAS AGAIN MUTE JANE HAD SOMETHING SHE WISHED TO SAY TO HIM WISHED VERY MUCH INDEED YET SHE FELT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT EVEN IF HE HAD ENCOURAGED HER AS HE KEPT SILENCE
6913-80509-0029 AND WALKED SO QUICKLY SPEECH ON HER PART WAS UTTERLY FORBIDDEN
6913-80509-0030 SHE WAS AN ODD FIGURE THUS DISGUISED IN HIS OVER JACKET

6913-80509-0037 JANE REPLIED SADLY SIDNEY TOOK A HOPEFUL TONE
6913-80509-0038 BEING SO NEAR THE HOUSE WHERE JANE'S PARENTS HAD LIVED I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN HE SAID
6913-80509-0039 JANE'S REPLY LEFT SMALL DOUBT ON THAT SCORE HER COMPANION LOOKED DOWN AT HER AGAIN AND SAID WITH COMPASSIONATE GENTLENESS
6913-80509-0040 THINGS'LL BE BETTER SOME DAY NO DOUBT
6913-80509-0041 SIDNEY MUTTERED TO HIMSELF AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE LIKE ONE WHO IS ANGRY
6913-80509-0042 UNDER THE GHASTLY HEAD NOW HAPPILY CONCEALED BY DARKNESS JANE STOPPED A LITTLE SHORT OF THE HOUSE AND REMOVED THE COAT THAT HAD SO EFFECTUALLY SHELTERED HER THANK YOU SIR SHE SAID RETURNING IT TO SIDNEY HE TOOK IT WITHOUT SPEAKING AND THREW IT OVER HIS ARM
6913-80509-0043 AT THE DOOR NOW CLOSED JANE GAVE A SINGLE KNOCK THEY WERE ADMITTED BY CLEM
