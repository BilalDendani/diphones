6534-64469-0000 MISTRESS ALICE WAS THERE QUIET AS EVER YET PALER AND THINNER THAN IN FORMER YEARS MISTRESS BABINGTON HERSELF HAD GONE BACK TO HER FAMILY LAST YEAR
6534-64469-0001 AND HIS SILENCE AS TO HIS OWN IDENTITY EXTRAORDINARY CARE TOO WAS OBSERVED BY HIS FRIENDS WHO HAD LEARNED BY NOW TO CALL HIM EVEN IN PRIVATE BY HIS ALIAS AND IT APPEARED CERTAIN
6534-64469-0002 THE MAN OF GOD AS LIKE OTHER PRIESTS HE WAS COMMONLY CALLED AMONGST THE CATHOLICS HAD ANY CONNECTION WHATEVER WITH THE HAWKING HUNTING AND HARD RIDING LOVER OF MISTRESS MANNERS IT WAS KNOWN INDEED
6534-64469-0003 TO SEND HIM TO DERBYSHIRE SINCE THIS WOULD BE THE VERY LAST PLACE IN WHICH HE WOULD BE LOOKED FOR HE HAD AVOIDED MATSTEAD THEN RIDING THROUGH IT ONCE ONLY BY NIGHT WITH STRANGE EMOTIONS AND HAD SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME IN THE SOUTH OF DERBYSHIRE
6534-64469-0004 CROSSING MORE THAN ONCE OVER INTO STAFFORD AND CHESTER AND RETURNING TO PADLEY OR TO BOOTH'S EDGE ONCE IN EVERY THREE OR FOUR MONTHS HE HAD LEARNED A HUNDRED LESSONS IN THESE WANDERINGS OF HIS
6534-64469-0005 THE NEWS THAT HE HAD NOW BROUGHT WITH HIM WAS OF THE WORST HE HAD HEARD FROM CATHOLICS IN DERBY THAT MISTER SIMPSON RETURNED AGAIN AFTER HIS BANISHMENT RECAPTURED A MONTH OR TWO AGO
6534-64469-0006 DECLARING THAT HE HAD DONE ALL THAT A MAN COULD DO
6534-64469-0007 AND THAT THERE WAS SOME LIMIT AFTER ALL TO WHAT GOD ALMIGHTY SHOULD DEMAND MARJORIE HAD CRIED OUT JUST NOW DRIVEN BEYOND HERSELF AT THE THOUGHT OF WHAT ALL THIS MUST MEAN FOR THE CATHOLICS OF THE COUNTRYSIDE
6534-64469-0008 HAD CRIED OUT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT SUCH A MAN AS MISTER SIMPSON COULD FALL THAT THE RUIN IT WOULD BRING UPON THE FAITH MUST BE PROPORTIONATE TO THE INFLUENCE HE ALREADY HAD WON THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY BY HIS YEARS OF LABOUR
6534-64469-0009 HAD SO FAR EVADED GRAVE SUSPICION RENDERED IT ONE OF THE GREATEST SAFEGUARDS THAT THE HUNTED CATHOLICS POSSESSED THAT THE WORK SHE WAS DOING BY HER ORGANIZATION OF MESSENGERS AND LETTERS MUST NOT BE RISKED EVEN FOR THE SAKE OF A MATTER LIKE THIS SHE HAD GIVEN IN AT LAST
6534-64469-0010 BUT HER SPIRIT SEEMED BROKEN ALTOGETHER TWO
6534-64469-0011 MISTRESS MANNERS HE SAID YOU REMEMBER MY SPEAKING TO YOU AFTER FOTHERINGAY OF A FELLOW OF MY LORD SHREWSBURY'S WHO HONOURED ME WITH HIS SUSPICIONS SHE NODDED I HAVE NEVER SET EYES ON HIM FROM THAT DAY TO THIS TO THIS HE ADDED
6534-64469-0012 WELL I STOPPED TO SPEAK WITH THESE TWO THE YOUNG MAN HATH LEFT MISTER MELVILLE'S SERVICE A WHILE BACK IT SEEMS AND IS TO TRY HIS FORTUNE IN FRANCE
6534-64469-0013 WHEN WHO SHOULD COME BY BUT A PARTY OF MEN AND MY LORD SHREWSBURY IN THE MIDST RIDING WITH MISTER ROGER COLUMBELL AND IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THEM MY FRIEND OF THE NEW INN OF FOTHERINGAY IT WAS ALL THE ILL FORTUNE IN THE WORLD THAT IT SHOULD BE AT SUCH MOMENT
6534-64469-0014 IF HE HAD SEEN ME ALONE HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT NO MORE OF ME
6534-64469-0015 IT WAS THE VERY QUESTION I PUT TO MYSELF SAID ROBIN AND I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF SEEING WHERE THEY WENT THEY WENT TO MISTER COLUMBELL'S OWN HOUSE AND INDOORS OF IT THE SERVING MEN HELD THE HORSES AT THE DOOR I WATCHED THEM AWHILE FROM MISTER BIDDELL'S WINDOW
6534-64469-0016 ROBIN LAUGHED I HAD FORGOTTEN MYSELF FOR ONCE WHY YES
6534-64469-0017 BUT TO HAVE HAD STRANGE BUSINESS AT FOTHERINGAY A YEAR AGO IS A SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE AND MISTER ALBAN BROKE IN THE OLD MAN YOU HAD BEST DO NOTHING AT ALL YOU WERE NOT FOLLOWED FROM DERBY YOU ARE AS SAFE IN PADLEY OR HERE AS YOU COULD BE ANYWHERE IN ENGLAND
6534-64469-0018 ALL THAT YOU HAD BEST DO IS TO REMAIN HERE A WEEK OR TWO AND NOT GO DOWN TO DERBY AGAIN FOR THE PRESENT I THINK THAT SHOWING OF YOURSELF OPENLY IN TOWNS HATH ITS DANGERS AS WELL AS ITS SAFEGUARDS MISTER JOHN GLANCED ROUND MARJORIE BOWED HER HEAD IN ASSENT
6534-64469-0019 I WILL DO PRECISELY AS YOU SAY SAID ROBIN EASILY AND NOW FOR THE NEWS OF HER GRACE'S SERVANTS HE HAD ALREADY AGAIN AND AGAIN TOLD THE TALE OF FOTHERINGAY SO FAR AS HE HAD SEEN IT IN THIS VERY PARLOUR
6534-64469-0020 AND HAD BEEN FORCED ALONG PARTLY WITH HIS WILL AND PARTLY AGAINST IT RIGHT THROUGH THE GREAT DOORS INTO THE VERY PLACE WHERE THE QUEEN HAD SUFFERED
6534-64469-0021 THE GREAT HALL HUNG WITH BLACK THROUGHOUT THE RAISED SCAFFOLD AT THE FURTHER END BESIDE THE FIRE THAT BLAZED ON THE WIDE HEARTH THE QUEEN'S SERVANTS BEING LED AWAY HALF SWOONING AS HE CAME IN THE DRESS OF VELVET THE STRAW AND THE BLOODY SAWDUST
6534-64469-0022 THE BEADS AND ALL THE OTHER PITIFUL RELICS BEING HEAPED UPON THE FIRE AS HE STOOD THERE IN THE STRUGGLING MOB AND ABOVE ALL THE FALLEN BODY IN ITS SHORT SKIRT AND BODICE LYING THERE WHERE IT FELL BESIDE THE LOW BLACK BLOCK
6534-64469-0023 HE HAD TOLD ALL THIS AS HE HAD SEEN IT FOR HIMSELF UNTIL THE SHERIFF'S MEN DROVE THEM ALL FORTH AGAIN INTO THE COURT AND HE HAD TOLD TOO OF ALL THAT HE HAD HEARD AFTERWARDS
6534-64469-0024 AND THE IMPRISONED WATCHERS HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE CASTLE HOW THE LITTLE DOG THAT HE HAD HEARD WAILING HAD LEAPT OUT AS THE HEAD FELL AT THE THIRD STROKE SO THAT HE WAS ALL BATHED IN HIS MISTRESS BLOOD ONE OF THE VERY SPANIELS NO DOUBT WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD SEEN AT CHARTLEY
6534-64469-0025 HOW THE DOG WAS TAKEN AWAY AND WASHED AND GIVEN AFTERWARDS INTO MISTER MELVILLE'S CHARGE HOW THE BODY AND THE HEAD HAD BEEN TAKEN UPSTAIRS HAD BEEN ROUGHLY EMBALMED AND LAID IN A LOCKED CHAMBER HOW HER SERVANTS HAD BEEN FOUND PEEPING THROUGH THE KEYHOLE
6534-64469-0026 AND PRAYING ALOUD THERE TILL SIR AMYAS HAD HAD THE HOLE STOPPED UP
6534-64469-0027 HAD BEEN PERMITTED TO SAY IN THE QUEEN'S ORATORY ON THE MORNING AFTER AND OF THE OATH THAT HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO TAKE THAT HE WOULD NOT SAY IT AGAIN OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ORATORY AND THE CONFISCATION OF THE ALTAR FURNITURE AND VESTMENTS ALL THIS HE HAD TOLD LITTLE BY LITTLE
6534-64469-0028 AND OF THE QUEEN'S NOBLE BEARING UPON THE SCAFFOLD HER UTTER FEARLESSNESS HER PROTESTATIONS THAT SHE DIED FOR HER RELIGION AND FOR THAT ONLY AND OF THE PESTERINGS OF DOCTOR FLETCHER DEAN OF PETERBOROUGH WHO HAD AT LAST GIVEN OVER IN DESPAIR AND PRAYED INSTEAD
6534-64469-0029 WAS MISTER DAVISON'S FAULT FOR DOING AS SHE TOLD HIM AND OF HER ACCUSATIONS ACCUSATIONS THAT DECEIVED NO MAN AGAINST THOSE WHO HAD SERVED HER OF THE FIRES MADE IN THE STREETS OF ALL GREAT TOWNS AS A MARK OF OFFICIAL REJOICING OVER MARY'S DEATH
6534-64469-0030 AND OF THE PITIFUL RESTITUTION MADE BY THE GREAT FUNERAL IN PETERBOROUGH SIX MONTHS AFTER AND THE ROYAL ESCUTCHEONS AND THE TAPERS AND THE HEARSE AND ALL THE REST OF THE LYING PRETENCES
6534-64469-0031 WELL IT WAS ALL OVER AND NOW HE TOLD THEM OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD TO DAY FROM YOUNG MERTON IN DERBY OF HOW NAU MARY'S FRENCH SECRETARY
6534-64469-0032 HAD BEEN REWARDED ALSO BY ELIZABETH AND THAT THE NATURE OF HIS SERVICES WAS UNMISTAKABLE WHILE ALL THE REST OF THEM WHO HAD REFUSED UTTERLY TO TAKE ANY PART IN THE INSOLENT MOURNING AT PETERBOROUGH EITHER IN THE CATHEDRAL OR AT THE BANQUET
6534-64469-0033 HAD FALLEN UNDER HER GRACE'S DISPLEASURE SO THAT SOME OF THEM EVEN NOW WERE SCARCELY OUT OF WARD MISTER BOURGOIGN
6534-64469-0034 TO THEIR GRACES OF FRANCE AND HAD MOST WISELY REMAINED THERE EVER SINCE SO THE PARTY SAT ROUND THE FIRE IN THE SAME LITTLE PARLOUR WHERE THEY HAD SAT SO OFTEN BEFORE
