8300-275127-0000 WAITING FOR SYDNEY TO COME INTO THE BEDROOM AS USUAL AND WISH HER GOOD NIGHT KITTY WAS ASTONISHED BY THE APPEARANCE OF HER GRANDMOTHER ENTERING ON TIPTOE FROM THE CORRIDOR WITH A SMALL PAPER PARCEL IN HER HAND
8300-275127-0001 WHISPER SAID MISSUS PRESTY POINTING TO THE OPEN DOOR OF COMMUNICATION WITH MISSUS LINLEY'S ROOM THIS IS YOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENT YOU MUSTN'T LOOK AT IT TILL YOU WAKE TO MORROW MORNING
8300-275127-0002 SHE PUSHED THE PARCEL UNDER THE PILLOW AND INSTEAD OF SAYING GOOD NIGHT TOOK A CHAIR AND SAT DOWN
8300-275127-0003 KITTY'S GRANDMOTHER DISAPPROVED OF SPENDING MONEY LAVISHLY ON BIRTHDAY GIFTS TO CHILDREN SHOW IT OF COURSE AND TAKE THE GREATEST CARE OF IT MISSUS PRESTY ANSWERED GRAVELY BUT TELL ME ONE THING MY DEAR
8300-275127-0004 WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO SEE ALL YOUR PRESENTS EARLY IN THE MORNING LIKE MINE STILL SMARTING UNDER THE RECOLLECTION OF HER INTERVIEW WITH HER SON IN LAW MISSUS PRESTY
8300-275127-0005 HAD CERTAIN ENDS TO GAIN IN PUTTING THIS IDEA INTO THE CHILD'S HEAD IT WAS HER SPECIAL OBJECT TO RAISE DOMESTIC OBSTACLES TO A PRIVATE INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE HUSBAND AND WIFE DURING THE EARLIER HOURS OF THE DAY
8300-275127-0006 IF THE GIFTS USUALLY PRESENTED AFTER THE NURSERY DINNER WERE PRODUCED ON THIS OCCASION AFTER BREAKFAST THERE WOULD BE A PERIOD OF DELAY BEFORE ANY CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATION
8300-275127-0007 COULD TAKE PLACE BETWEEN MISTER AND MISSUS LINLEY IN THIS INTERVAL MISSUS PRESTY SAW HER OPPORTUNITY OF SETTING LINLEY'S AUTHORITY AT DEFIANCE BY ROUSING THE FIRST JEALOUS SUSPICION
8300-275127-0008 IN THE MIND OF HIS WIFE INNOCENT LITTLE KITTY BECAME HER GRANDMOTHER'S ACCOMPLICE ON THE SPOT I SHALL ASK MAMMA TO LET ME HAVE MY PRESENTS AT BREAKFAST TIME SHE ANNOUNCED
8300-275127-0009 AND KIND MAMMA WILL SAY YES MISSUS PRESTY CHIMED IN WE WILL BREAKFAST EARLY MY PRECIOUS CHILD GOOD NIGHT KITTY WAS HALF ASLEEP WHEN HER GOVERNESS ENTERED THE ROOM AFTERWARD MUCH LATER THAN USUAL
8300-275127-0010 I THOUGHT YOU HAD FORGOTTEN ME SHE SAID YAWNING AND STRETCHING OUT HER PLUMP LITTLE ARMS SYDNEY'S HEART ACHED WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF THE SEPARATION THAT WAS TO COME WITH THE NEXT DAY
8300-275127-0011 HER DESPAIR FORCED ITS WAY TO EXPRESSION IN WORDS I WISH I COULD FORGET YOU SHE ANSWERED IN RECKLESS WRETCHEDNESS THE CHILD WAS STILL TOO DROWSY TO HEAR PLAINLY
8300-275127-0012 WHAT DID YOU SAY SHE ASKED SYDNEY GENTLY LIFTED HER IN THE BED AND KISSED HER AGAIN AND AGAIN KITTY'S SLEEPY EYES OPENED IN SURPRISE HOW COLD YOUR HANDS ARE SHE SAID
8300-275127-0013 AND HOW OFTEN YOU KISS ME WHAT IS IT YOU HAVE COME TO SAY TO ME GOOD NIGHT OR GOOD BY SYDNEY LAID HER DOWN AGAIN ON THE PILLOW GAVE HER A LAST KISS AND RAN OUT OF THE ROOM
8300-275127-0014 IN THE CORRIDOR SHE HEARD LINLEY'S VOICE ON THE LOWER FLOOR HE WAS ASKING ONE OF THE SERVANTS IF MISS WESTERFIELD WAS IN THE HOUSE OR IN THE GARDEN HER FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO ADVANCE TO THE STAIRS
8300-275127-0015 AND TO ANSWER HIS QUESTION IN A MOMENT MORE THE REMEMBRANCE OF MISSUS LINLEY CHECKED HER SHE WENT BACK TO HER BED CHAMBER THE PRESENTS THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED SINCE HER ARRIVAL AT MOUNT MORVEN
8300-275127-0016 ENTERING THE ROOM AFTER SHE HAD LEFT THE HOUSE ON THE SOFA LAY THE PRETTY NEW DRESS WHICH SHE HAD WORN AT THE EVENING PARTY OTHER LITTLE GIFTS WERE ARRANGED ON EITHER SIDE OF IT
8300-275127-0017 KEPT A MORSEL OF PAPER IN ITS PLACE ON WHICH SHE HAD WRITTEN A FEW PENITENT WORDS OF FAREWELL ADDRESSED TO MISSUS LINLEY
8300-275127-0018 ON THE TOILET TABLE THREE PHOTOGRAPHIC PORTRAITS SHOWED THEMSELVES AMONG THE BRUSHES AND COMBS
8300-275127-0019 HAD SHE ANY RIGHT TO MAKE THOSE DEAR FACES HER COMPANIONS IN THE FUTURE SHE HESITATED HER TEARS DROPPED ON THE PHOTOGRAPHS THEY'RE AS GOOD AS SPOILED NOW SHE THOUGHT
8300-275127-0020 THEY'RE NO LONGER FIT FOR ANYBODY BUT ME SHE PAUSED AND ABRUPTLY TOOK UP THE THIRD AND LAST PHOTOGRAPH THE LIKENESS OF HERBERT LINLEY WAS IT AN OFFENSE NOW EVEN TO LOOK AT HIS PORTRAIT
8300-275127-0021 HER RESOLUTION VIBRATED BETWEEN TWO MISERIES THE MISERY OF PRESERVING HER KEEP SAKE AFTER SHE HAD PARTED FROM HIM FOREVER AND THE MISERY OF DESTROYING IT
8300-275127-0022 RESIGNED TO ONE MORE SACRIFICE SHE TOOK THE CARD IN BOTH HANDS TO TEAR IT UP IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SCATTERED IN PIECES ON THE FLOOR BUT FOR THE CHANCE WHICH HAD TURNED THE PORTRAIT SIDE OF THE CARD TOWARD HER
8300-275127-0023 INSTEAD OF THE BACK HER LONGING EYES STOLE A LAST LOOK AT HIM A FRENZY SEIZED HER SHE PRESSED HER LIPS TO THE PHOTOGRAPH IN A PASSION OF HOPELESS LOVE WHAT DOES IT MATTER SHE ASKED HERSELF
8300-275127-0024 I'M NOTHING BUT THE IGNORANT OBJECT OF HIS KINDNESS THE POOR FOOL WHO COULD SEE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GRATITUDE AND LOVE WHERE IS THE HARM OF HAVING HIM WITH ME WHEN I AM STARVING IN THE STREETS
8300-275127-0025 OR DYING IN THE WORKHOUSE THE FERVID SPIRIT IN HER THAT HAD NEVER KNOWN A MOTHER'S LOVING DISCIPLINE NEVER THRILLED TO THE SYMPATHY OF A SISTER FRIEND
8300-275127-0026 ROSE IN REVOLT AGAINST THE EVIL DESTINY WHICH HAD IMBITTERED HER LIFE HER EYES STILL RESTED ON THE PHOTOGRAPH COME TO MY HEART MY ONLY FRIEND AND KILL ME
8300-275127-0027 AS THOSE WILD WORDS ESCAPED HER SHE THRUST THE CARD FURIOUSLY INTO THE BOSOM OF HER DRESS AND THREW HERSELF ON THE FLOOR THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE MAD SELF ABANDONMENT OF THAT ACTION
8300-275127-0028 WHICH MOCKED THE INNOCENT DESPAIR OF HER CHILDHOOD ON THE DAY WHEN HER MOTHER LEFT HER AT THE CRUEL MERCY OF HER AUNT THAT NIGHT WAS A NIGHT OF TORMENT IN SECRET TO ANOTHER PERSON AT MOUNT MORVEN
8300-275127-0029 WANDERING IN HIS NEED OF SELF ISOLATION UP AND DOWN THE DREARY STONE PASSAGES IN THE LOWER PART OF THE HOUSE LINLEY COUNTED THE HOURS INEXORABLY LESSENING THE INTERVAL BETWEEN HIM
8300-275127-0030 AND THE ORDEAL OF CONFESSION TO HIS WIFE AS YET HE HAD FAILED TO FIND THE OPPORTUNITY OF ADDRESSING TO SYDNEY THE ONLY WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT HE COULD ALLOW TO PASS HIS LIPS
8300-275127-0031 HE HAD ASKED FOR HER EARLIER IN THE EVENING AND NOBODY COULD TELL HIM WHERE SHE WAS STILL IN IGNORANCE OF THE REFUGE WHICH SHE MIGHT BY BARE POSSIBILITY HOPE TO FIND IN MISSUS MAC EDWIN'S HOUSE
8300-275127-0032 SYDNEY WAS SPARED THE TORTURING DOUBTS WHICH NOW BESET HERBERT LINLEY'S MIND WOULD THE NOBLE WOMAN WHOM THEY HAD INJURED ALLOW THEIR ATONEMENT TO PLEAD FOR THEM
8300-275127-0033 AND CONSENT TO KEEP THEIR MISERABLE SECRET MIGHT THEY STILL PUT THEIR TRUST IN THAT GENEROUS NATURE A FEW HOURS HENCE
