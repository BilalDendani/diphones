7188-82904-0023 WHO WAS RAPIDLY NEARING THAT STATE OF MIND WHICH IS LOCALLY DESCRIBED AS BEING STRICTLY ON THE FIGHT I EXPECT SHE THINKS I'LL AMUSE HER SOME MORE HE THOUGHT SAVAGELY AS THEY GALLOPED AWAY THROUGH THE QUIVERING SUNLIGHT
7188-82904-0024 AND THE HORSES WERE COMPELLED TO WALK THEN IT WAS THAT CHIP'S NATIVE CHIVALRY AND SELF MASTERY WERE PUT TO TEST
7188-82904-0025 BEFORE NOW DRAWN MUCH OF THE LONELY ACHE OUT OF HIS HEART AND KEYED HIM UP TO THE LIFE WHICH HE MUST LIVE AND WHICH CHAFED HIS SPIRIT MORE THAN EVEN HE REALIZED INSTEAD OF SUCH SLENDER COMFORT
7188-82904-0026 HE WAS FORCED TO RIDE BESIDE THE GIRL WHO HAD HURT HIM SO CLOSE THAT HIS KNEE SOMETIMES BRUSHED HER HORSE AND TO LISTEN TO HER FRIENDLY CHATTER AND MAKE ANSWER AT TIMES WITH AT LEAST SOME SHOW OF CIVILITY
