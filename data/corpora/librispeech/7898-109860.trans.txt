7898-109860-0000 IS MYSTERIOUS MISS CRAMP WAS IN THE HABIT OF CALLING UPON SOME TRUSTEE TO SPEAK AT THE CLOSE OF THE EXERCISES USUALLY MISTER SEMPLE AND THEN THERE WAS A LITTLE SOCIAL TIME BEFORE THE ASSEMBLAGE BROKE UP
7898-109860-0001 BUT THE FROWN ON THE CHAIRMAN'S FACE DID NOT SUGGEST THAT THAT GENTLEMAN HAD ANYTHING VERY JOVIAL TO SAY AT THE MOMENT AND THE TEACHER CLOSED THE EXERCISES HERSELF IN A FEW WORDS THAT WERE NOT AT ALL PERSONAL TO THE WINNER OF THE SPELLING MATCH
7898-109860-0002 WHEN THE STIR OF PEOPLE MOVING ABOUT AROUSED RUTH HER ONLY THOUGHT WAS TO GET AWAY FROM THE SCHOOLHOUSE PERHAPS NOT MORE THAN TWO DOZEN PEOPLE HAD DISTINCTLY HEARD WHAT JULIA SO CRUELLY SAID TO HER BUT IT SEEMED TO THE GIRL FROM THE RED MILL
7898-109860-0003 AS THOUGH EVERYBODY IN THAT THRONG KNEW THAT SHE WAS A CHARITY CHILD THAT AS JULIA SAID THE VERY FROCK SHE HAD ON BELONGED TO SOMEBODY ELSE AND TO HELEN
7898-109860-0004 SHE HAD NEVER FOR A MOMENT SUSPECTED THAT HELEN HAD BEEN THE DONOR OF THE THREE FROCKS OF COURSE EVERYBODY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAD KNOWN ALL THE TIME THAT SHE WAS WEARING HELEN'S CAST OFF CLOTHING EVERYBODY BUT RUTH HERSELF WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THE DRESSES
7898-109860-0005 SHE HAD BEEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SO SHORT A TIME THAT OF COURSE SHE WAS NOT VERY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HELEN'S WARDROBE AT THE MOMENT SHE COULD NOT FEEL THANKFUL TO HER CHUM SHE COULD ONLY REMEMBER JULIA'S CUTTING WORDS
7898-109860-0006 AND FEEL THE STING TO HER PRIDE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE SHOWN HERSELF BEFORE ALL BEHOLDERS THE RECIPIENT OF HER FRIEND'S ALMS NOBODY SPOKE TO HER AS SHE GLIDED THROUGH THE MOVING CROWD AND REACHED THE DOOR MISS CRAMP WAS DELAYED IN GETTING TO HER
7898-109860-0007 HELEN AND TOM DID NOT SEE HER GO FOR THEY WERE ACROSS THE ROOM AND FARTHEST FROM THE DOOR AND SO SHE REACHED THE EXIT AND SLIPPED OUT THE MEN AND BOYS FROM OUTSIDE THRONGED THE TINY ANTEROOM AND THE STEPS
7898-109860-0008 AS SHE PUSHED THROUGH THEM ONE MAN SAID
7898-109860-0009 SHE'D OUGHTER HAVE A PRIZE FOR THAT THAT'S WHAT SHE OUGHT BUT RUTH COULD NOT REPLY TO THIS ALTHOUGH SHE KNEW IT WAS MEANT KINDLY SHE WENT OUT INTO THE DARKNESS THERE WERE MANY HORSES HITCHED ABOUT THE SCHOOLHOUSE
7898-109860-0010 BUT SHE REACHED THE CLEAR ROAD IN SAFETY AND RAN TOWARD THE RED MILL THE GIRL CAME TO THE MILL AND WENT QUIETLY INTO THE KITCHEN
7898-109860-0011 BUT AUNT ALVIRY'S BRIGHT EYES DISCOVERED AT ONCE THAT SHE WAS UNHAPPY

7898-109860-0043 AND WAS WITHIN THE MEANS OF MOST OF THE GIRL PUPILS NOBODY ASKED RUTH WHAT SHE WOULD WEAR AND SHE WAS GLAD OF THAT FOR SHE KNEW THAT SHE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO DON THE SHABBY BLACK CLOTH FROCK SHE HAD WORN AT FIRST OR ONE OF THE CHARITY FROCKS
7898-109860-0044 IN THIS FIRST WEEK AFTER THE SPELLING BEE SHE DID NOT SEE HELEN OR TOM AND ONLY RECEIVED A BRIEF NOTE FROM HELEN WHICH SHE TRIED TO ANSWER WITH HER USUAL CHEERFULNESS HELEN AND TOM WERE GOING TO THE CITY FOR A FEW DAYS
7898-109860-0045 THEREFORE RUTH WAS NOT LIKELY TO SEE EITHER UNTIL THE END OF THE TERM AT THE RED MILL MATTERS WENT MUCH THE SAME AS USUAL
