177-123525-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN FROM JOY TO DEATH FOR TEN DAYS THE HORDES OF THARK AND THEIR WILD ALLIES WERE FEASTED AND ENTERTAINED AND THEN LOADED WITH COSTLY PRESENTS
177-123525-0001 THEY STARTED ON THE RETURN JOURNEY TO THEIR OWN LANDS THE JED OF LESSER HELIUM WITH A SMALL PARTY OF NOBLES ACCOMPANIED THEM ALL THE WAY TO THARK TO CEMENT MORE CLOSELY THE NEW BONDS OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP
177-123525-0002 SOLA ALSO ACCOMPANIED TARS TARKAS HER FATHER WHO BEFORE ALL HIS CHIEFTAINS HAD ACKNOWLEDGED HER AS HIS DAUGHTER
177-123525-0003 RETURNED UPON A BATTLESHIP THAT HAD BEEN DISPATCHED TO THARK TO FETCH THEM IN TIME FOR THE CEREMONY WHICH MADE DEJAH
177-123525-0004 THE PEOPLE SEEMED NEVER TO TIRE OF HEAPING HONORS UPON ME AND NO DAY PASSED THAT DID NOT BRING SOME NEW PROOF OF THEIR LOVE FOR MY PRINCESS THE INCOMPARABLE DEJAH THORIS
177-123525-0005 LAY A SNOW WHITE EGG FOR NEARLY FIVE YEARS TEN SOLDIERS OF THE JEDDAK'S GUARD HAD CONSTANTLY STOOD OVER IT AND NOT A DAY PASSED WHEN I WAS IN THE CITY THAT DEJAH THORIS AND I DID NOT STAND HAND IN HAND BEFORE OUR LITTLE SHRINE PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE
177-123525-0006 WHEN THE DELICATE SHELL SHOULD BREAK VIVID IN MY MEMORY IS THE PICTURE OF THE LAST NIGHT AS WE SAT THERE TALKING IN LOW TONES OF THE STRANGE ROMANCE WHICH HAD WOVEN OUR LIVES TOGETHER AND OF THIS WONDER WHICH WAS COMING TO AUGMENT OUR HAPPINESS
177-123525-0007 AND FULFILL OUR HOPES IN THE DISTANCE WE SAW THE BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT OF AN APPROACHING AIRSHIP BUT WE ATTACHED NO SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE TO SO COMMON A SIGHT LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING IT RACED TOWARD HELIUM UNTIL ITS VERY SPEED
177-123525-0008 BESPOKE THE UNUSUAL FLASHING THE SIGNALS WHICH PROCLAIMED IT A DISPATCH BEARER FOR THE JEDDAK IT CIRCLED IMPATIENTLY AWAITING THE TARDY PATROL BOAT WHICH MUST CONVOY IT TO THE PALACE DOCKS
177-123525-0009 A MESSAGE CALLED ME TO THE COUNCIL CHAMBER WHICH I FOUND FILLING WITH THE MEMBERS OF THAT BODY ON THE RAISED PLATFORM OF THE THRONE
177-123525-0010 PACING BACK AND FORTH WITH TENSE DRAWN FACE WHEN ALL WERE IN THEIR SEATS HE TURNED TOWARD US THIS MORNING HE SAID
177-123525-0011 THAT THE KEEPER OF THE ATMOSPHERE PLANT HAD MADE NO WIRELESS REPORT FOR TWO DAYS NOR HAD ALMOST CEASELESS CALLS UPON HIM FROM A SCORE OF CAPITALS ELICITED A SIGN OF RESPONSE THE AMBASSADORS OF THE OTHER NATIONS ASKED US TO TAKE THE MATTER IN HAND
177-123525-0012 AND HASTEN THE ASSISTANT KEEPER TO THE PLANT ALL DAY A THOUSAND CRUISERS HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR HIM UNTIL JUST NOW ONE OF THEM RETURNS BEARING HIS DEAD BODY WHICH WAS FOUND IN THE PITS BENEATH HIS HOUSE HORRIBLY MUTILATED BY SOME ASSASSIN
177-123525-0013 I DO NOT NEED TO TELL YOU WHAT THIS MEANS TO BARSOOM IT WOULD TAKE MONTHS TO PENETRATE THOSE MIGHTY WALLS IN FACT THE WORK HAS ALREADY COMMENCED AND THERE WOULD BE LITTLE TO FEAR WERE THE ENGINE OF THE PUMPING PLANT TO RUN AS IT SHOULD
177-123525-0014 BUT THE WORST WE FEAR HAS HAPPENED THE INSTRUMENTS SHOW A RAPIDLY DECREASING AIR PRESSURE ON ALL PARTS OF BARSOOM THE ENGINE HAS STOPPED MY GENTLEMEN HE CONCLUDED WE HAVE AT BEST THREE DAYS TO LIVE
177-123525-0015 THERE WAS ABSOLUTE SILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AND THEN A YOUNG NOBLE AROSE
177-123525-0016 NOW IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THEM HOW THEY SHOULD DIE LET US GO ABOUT OUR DUTIES AS THOUGH A THOUSAND USEFUL YEARS STILL LAY BEFORE US THE CHAMBER RANG WITH APPLAUSE
177-123525-0017 WE WENT OUR WAYS WITH SMILES UPON OUR FACES AND SORROW GNAWING AT OUR HEARTS
177-123525-0018 SO I TOLD HER ALL THAT I HAD HEARD WE HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY JOHN CARTER SHE SAID AND I THANK WHATEVER FATE OVERTAKES US THAT IT PERMITS US TO DIE TOGETHER
177-123525-0019 THE NEXT TWO DAYS BROUGHT NO NOTICEABLE CHANGE IN THE SUPPLY OF AIR
177-123525-0020 THE AVENUES AND PLAZAS OF HELIUM WERE FILLED WITH PEOPLE ALL BUSINESS HAD CEASED FOR THE MOST PART THE PEOPLE LOOKED BRAVELY INTO THE FACE OF THEIR UNALTERABLE DOOM HERE AND THERE HOWEVER MEN AND WOMEN GAVE WAY TO QUIET GRIEF
177-123525-0021 TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY MANY OF THE WEAKER COMMENCED TO SUCCUMB AND WITHIN AN HOUR THE PEOPLE OF BARSOOM WERE SINKING BY THOUSANDS INTO THE UNCONSCIOUSNESS WHICH PRECEDES DEATH BY ASPHYXIATION
177-123525-0022 DEJAH THORIS AND I WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY HAD COLLECTED IN A SUNKEN GARDEN WITHIN AN INNER COURTYARD OF THE PALACE WE CONVERSED IN LOW TONES WHEN WE CONVERSED AT ALL
177-123525-0023 AS THE AWE OF THE GRIM SHADOW OF DEATH CREPT OVER US EVEN WOOLA SEEMED TO FEEL THE WEIGHT OF THE IMPENDING CALAMITY FOR HE PRESSED CLOSE TO DEJAH THORIS AND TO ME WHINING PITIFULLY
177-123525-0024 THAT NOW SHE WOULD NEVER KNOW AS IT WAS BECOMING PERCEPTIBLY DIFFICULT TO BREATHE TARDOS MORS AROSE SAYING LET US BID EACH OTHER FAREWELL THE DAYS OF THE GREATNESS OF BARSOOM ARE OVER
177-123525-0025 WHICH THROUGH ALL ETERNITY MUST GO SWINGING THROUGH THE HEAVENS PEOPLED NOT EVEN BY MEMORIES IT IS THE END
177-123525-0026 HE STOOPED AND KISSED THE WOMEN OF HIS FAMILY AND LAID HIS STRONG HAND UPON THE SHOULDERS OF THE MEN AS I TURNED SADLY FROM HIM MY EYES FELL UPON DEJAH THORIS HER HEAD WAS DROOPING UPON HER BREAST TO ALL APPEARANCES SHE WAS LIFELESS
177-123525-0027 HER EYES OPENED AND LOOKED INTO MINE KISS ME JOHN CARTER SHE MURMURED I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU IT IS CRUEL THAT WE MUST BE TORN APART WHO WERE JUST STARTING UPON
177-123525-0028 AS I PRESSED HER DEAR LIPS TO MINE THE OLD FEELING OF UNCONQUERABLE POWER AND AUTHORITY ROSE IN ME THE FIGHTING BLOOD OF VIRGINIA SPRANG TO LIFE IN MY VEINS IT SHALL NOT BE MY PRINCESS
177-123525-0029 I CRIED THERE IS THERE MUST BE SOME WAY AND JOHN CARTER WHO HAS FOUGHT HIS WAY THROUGH A STRANGE WORLD FOR LOVE OF YOU WILL FIND IT AND WITH MY WORDS THERE CREPT ABOVE THE THRESHOLD OF MY CONSCIOUS MIND A SERIES OF
177-123525-0030 NINE LONG FORGOTTEN SOUNDS LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IN THE DARKNESS THEIR FULL PURPORT DAWNED UPON ME
177-123525-0031 HE DID NOT WAIT TO QUESTION BUT IN AN INSTANT A GUARD WAS RACING TO THE NEAREST DOCK AND THOUGH THE AIR WAS THIN AND ALMOST GONE AT THE ROOFTOP THEY MANAGED TO LAUNCH THE FASTEST ONE MAN AIR SCOUT MACHINE THAT THE SKILL OF BARSOOM HAD EVER PRODUCED
177-123525-0032 KISSING DEJAH THORIS A DOZEN TIMES AND COMMANDING WOOLA WHO WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED ME TO REMAIN AND GUARD HER I BOUNDED WITH MY OLD AGILITY AND STRENGTH TO THE HIGH RAMPARTS OF THE PALACE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT I WAS HEADED TOWARD THE GOAL OF THE HOPES OF
177-123525-0033 ALL BARSOOM I HAD TO FLY LOW TO GET SUFFICIENT AIR TO BREATHE BUT I TOOK A STRAIGHT COURSE ACROSS AN OLD SEA BOTTOM AND SO HAD TO RISE ONLY A FEW FEET ABOVE THE GROUND I TRAVELED WITH AWFUL VELOCITY FOR MY ERRAND WAS A RACE AGAINST TIME WITH DEATH
177-123525-0034 THE FACE OF DEJAH THORIS HUNG ALWAYS BEFORE ME AS I TURNED FOR A LAST LOOK AS I LEFT THE PALACE GARDEN I HAD SEEN HER STAGGER AND SINK UPON THE GROUND BESIDE THE LITTLE INCUBATOR THAT SHE HAD DROPPED INTO THE LAST COMA WHICH WOULD END IN DEATH
177-123525-0035 IF THE AIR SUPPLY REMAINED UNREPLENISHED I WELL KNEW AND SO THROWING CAUTION TO THE WINDS I FLUNG OVERBOARD EVERYTHING BUT THE ENGINE AND COMPASS
177-123525-0036 PUSHING THE SPEED LEVER TO ITS LAST NOTCH I SPLIT THE THIN AIR OF DYING MARS WITH THE SPEED OF A METEOR AN HOUR BEFORE DARK THE GREAT WALLS OF THE ATMOSPHERE PLANT LOOMED SUDDENLY BEFORE ME AND WITH A SICKENING
177-123525-0037 WHICH WAS WITHHOLDING THE SPARK OF LIFE FROM THE INHABITANTS OF AN ENTIRE PLANET BESIDE THE DOOR A GREAT CREW OF MEN HAD BEEN LABORING TO PIERCE THE WALL BUT THEY HAD SCARCELY SCRATCHED THE FLINT LIKE SURFACE
177-123525-0038 CONDITIONS SEEMED MUCH WORSE HERE THAN AT HELIUM AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT I BREATHED AT ALL THERE WERE A FEW MEN STILL CONSCIOUS AND TO ONE OF THESE I SPOKE IF I CAN OPEN THESE DOORS IS THERE A MAN WHO CAN START THE ENGINES I ASKED I CAN
177-123525-0039 HE REPLIED IF YOU OPEN QUICKLY I CAN LAST BUT A FEW MOMENTS MORE BUT IT IS USELESS THEY ARE BOTH DEAD AND NO ONE ELSE UPON BARSOOM KNEW THE SECRET OF THESE AWFUL LOCKS FOR THREE DAYS
177-123525-0040 MEN CRAZED WITH FEAR HAVE SURGED ABOUT THIS PORTAL IN VAIN ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE ITS MYSTERY I HAD NO TIME TO TALK I WAS BECOMING VERY WEAK AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT I CONTROLLED MY MIND AT ALL BUT WITH A FINAL EFFORT AS I SANK WEAKLY TO MY KNEES I HURLED
177-123525-0041 THE NINE THOUGHT WAVES AT THAT AWFUL THING BEFORE ME THE MARTIAN HAD CRAWLED TO MY SIDE AND WITH STARING EYES FIXED ON THE SINGLE PANEL BEFORE US WE WAITED IN THE SILENCE OF DEATH SLOWLY
177-123525-0042 I WAS TOO WEAK AFTER IT I CRIED TO MY COMPANION AND IF YOU REACH THE PUMP ROOM TURN LOOSE ALL THE PUMPS IT IS THE ONLY CHANCE BARSOOM HAS TO EXIST TOMORROW FROM WHERE I LAY I OPENED THE SECOND DOOR
177-123525-0043 AND THEN THE THIRD AND AS I SAW THE HOPE OF BARSOOM CRAWLING
177-123525-0044 I SANK UNCONSCIOUS
