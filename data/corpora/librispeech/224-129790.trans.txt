224-129790-0000 CHAPTER TEN DON DIEGO
224-129790-0001 AND WITH LANGUID EYES IN ACHING HEAD HE LOOKED ROUND THE CABIN WHICH WAS FLOODED WITH SUNLIGHT FROM THE SQUARE WINDOWS ASTERN THEN HE UTTERED A MOAN AND CLOSED HIS EYES AGAIN IMPELLED TO THIS BY THE MONSTROUS ACHE IN HIS HEAD
224-129790-0002 LYING THUS HE ATTEMPTED TO THINK TO LOCATE HIMSELF IN TIME AND SPACE BUT BETWEEN THE PAIN IN HIS HEAD AND THE CONFUSION IN HIS MIND HE FOUND COHERENT THOUGHT IMPOSSIBLE
224-129790-0003 AN INDEFINITE SENSE OF ALARM DROVE HIM TO OPEN HIS EYES AGAIN AND ONCE MORE TO CONSIDER HIS SURROUNDINGS
224-129790-0004 THE LOW POSITION OF THE SUN FLOODING THE CABIN WITH GOLDEN LIGHT FROM THOSE SQUARE PORTS ASTERN SUGGESTED TO HIM AT FIRST THAT IT WAS EARLY MORNING ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE VESSEL WAS HEADED WESTWARD THEN THE ALTERNATIVE OCCURRED TO HIM
224-129790-0005 THEY MIGHT BE SAILING EASTWARD IN WHICH CASE THE TIME OF DAY WOULD BE LATE AFTERNOON THAT THEY WERE SAILING HE COULD FEEL FROM THE GENTLE FORWARD HEAVE OF THE VESSEL UNDER HIM BUT HOW DID THEY COME TO BE SAILING AND HE THE MASTER
224-129790-0006 HIS MIND WENT BACK OVER THE ADVENTURE OF YESTERDAY IF OF YESTERDAY IT WAS HE WAS CLEAR ON THE MATTER OF THE EASILY SUCCESSFUL RAID UPON THE ISLAND OF BARBADOS EVERY DETAIL STOOD VIVIDLY IN HIS MEMORY UP TO THE MOMENT AT WHICH
224-129790-0007 RETURNING ABOARD HE HAD STEPPED ON TO HIS OWN DECK AGAIN THERE MEMORY ABRUPTLY AND INEXPLICABLY CEASED HE WAS BEGINNING TO TORTURE HIS MIND WITH CONJECTURE
224-129790-0008 WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND TO DON DIEGO'S INCREASING MYSTIFICATION HE BEHELD HIS BEST SUIT OF CLOTHES STEP INTO THE CABIN IT WAS A SINGULARLY ELEGANT AND CHARACTERISTICALLY SPANISH SUIT OF BLACK TAFFETAS
224-129790-0009 WITH SILVER LACE THAT HAD BEEN MADE FOR HIM A YEAR AGO IN CADIZ AND HE KNEW EACH DETAIL OF IT SO WELL THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE HE COULD NOW BE MISTAKEN THE SUIT PAUSED TO CLOSE THE DOOR
224-129790-0010 THEN ADVANCED TOWARDS THE COUCH ON WHICH DON DIEGO WAS EXTENDED AND INSIDE THE SUIT CAME A TALL SLENDER GENTLEMAN OF ABOUT DON DIEGO'S OWN HEIGHT AND SHAPE SEEING THE WIDE STARTLED EYES OF THE SPANIARD UPON HIM
224-129790-0011 THAT REGARDED HIM OUT OF A TAWNY SARDONIC FACE SET IN A CLUSTER OF BLACK RINGLETS BUT HE WAS TOO BEWILDERED TO MAKE ANY ANSWER THE STRANGER'S FINGERS TOUCHED THE TOP OF DON DIEGO'S HEAD
224-129790-0012 HE TOOK DON DIEGO'S WRIST BETWEEN THUMB AND SECOND FINGER AND THEN AT LAST THE INTRIGUED SPANIARD SPOKE ARE YOU A DOCTOR AMONG OTHER THINGS
224-129790-0013 DON DIEGO STRUGGLED UP INTO A SITTING POSITION ON THE RED VELVET COUCH
224-129790-0014 AND WHAT THE DEVIL ARE YOU DOING IN MY CLOTHES AND ABOARD MY SHIP
224-129790-0015 YOU ARE STILL DELIRIOUS I FEAR THIS IS NOT YOUR SHIP THIS IS MY SHIP AND THESE ARE MY CLOTHES YOUR SHIP QUOTH THE OTHER AGHAST AND STILL MORE AGHAST HE ADDED YOUR CLOTHES BUT
224-129790-0016 THEN WILDLY HIS EYES LOOKED ABOUT HIM THEY SCANNED THE CABIN ONCE AGAIN SCRUTINIZING EACH FAMILIAR OBJECT AM I MAD HE ASKED AT LAST
224-129790-0017 THEN THE SPANIARD BROKE OFF HIS GLANCE GREW STILL MORE TROUBLED
224-129790-0018 CAPTAIN PETER BLOOD THIS SHIP LIKE THIS HANDSOME SUIT OF CLOTHES IS MINE BY RIGHT OF CONQUEST JUST AS YOU DON DIEGO ARE MY PRISONER STARTLING AS WAS THE EXPLANATION
224-129790-0019 YET IT PROVED SOOTHING TO DON DIEGO BEING SO MUCH LESS STARTLING THAN THE THINGS HE WAS BEGINNING TO IMAGINE BUT ARE YOU NOT SPANISH THEN YOU FLATTER MY CASTILIAN ACCENT I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE IRISH
224-129790-0020 YOU WERE THINKING THAT A MIRACLE HAD HAPPENED SO IT HAS A MIRACLE WROUGHT BY MY GENIUS WHICH IS CONSIDERABLE
224-129790-0021 IT WAS A NARRATIVE THAT PAINTED RED AND WHITE BY TURNS THE SPANIARD'S COUNTENANCE HE PUT A HAND TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND THERE DISCOVERED IN CONFIRMATION OF THE STORY A LUMP AS LARGE AS A PIGEON'S EGG
224-129790-0022 LASTLY HE STARED WILD EYED AT THE SARDONIC CAPTAIN BLOOD AND MY SON
224-129790-0023 DON DIEGO SANK BACK ON THE COUCH HIS GLITTERING DARK EYES FIXED UPON THE TAWNY FACE ABOVE HIM HE COMPOSED HIMSELF AFTER ALL HE POSSESSED THE STOICISM PROPER TO HIS DESPERATE TRADE
224-129790-0024 THE DICE HAD FALLEN AGAINST HIM IN THIS VENTURE THE TABLES HAD BEEN TURNED UPON HIM IN THE VERY MOMENT OF SUCCESS HE ACCEPTED THE SITUATION WITH THE FORTITUDE OF A FATALIST
224-129790-0025 WITH THE UTMOST CALM HE ENQUIRED AND NOW SENIOR CAPITAN AND
224-129790-0026 BUT IS THAT NECESSARY HE ASKED WITHOUT APPARENT PERTURBATION CAPTAIN BLOOD'S BLUE EYES APPROVED HIS BEARING ASK YOURSELF SAID HE
224-129790-0027 AH BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE DON DIEGO SAT UP TO ARGUE THE MATTER IT LIES IN THE FACT THAT YOU BOAST YOURSELF A HUMANE MAN
224-129790-0028 AND I'LL NOT ALLOW A NATURAL IRISH SENTIMENTALITY TO STAND IN THE WAY OF MY DOING WHAT IS NECESSARY AND PROPER
224-129790-0029 SHE IS NONE SO WELL FOUND IN WATER AND PROVISIONS TRUE WE ARE FORTUNATELY A SMALL NUMBER BUT YOU AND YOUR PARTY INCONVENIENTLY INCREASE IT
224-129790-0030 SO THAT ON EVERY HAND YOU SEE PRUDENCE SUGGESTS TO US THAT WE SHOULD DENY OURSELVES THE PLEASURE OF YOUR COMPANY AND STEELING OUR SOFT HEARTS TO THE INEVITABLE INVITE YOU TO BE SO OBLIGING AS TO STEP OVER THE SIDE I SEE
224-129790-0031 SAID THE SPANIARD PENSIVELY HE SWUNG HIS LEGS FROM THE COUCH AND SAT NOW UPON THE EDGE OF IT HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES
224-129790-0032 I CONFESS HE ADMITTED THAT THERE IS MUCH FORCE IN WHAT YOU SAY YOU TAKE A LOAD FROM MY MIND SAID CAPTAIN BLOOD I WOULD NOT APPEAR UNNECESSARILY HARSH ESPECIALLY SINCE I AND MY FRIENDS OWE YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR
224-129790-0033 TO US YOUR RAID UPON BARBADOS WAS MOST OPPORTUNE I AM GLAD THEREFORE THAT YOU AGREE
224-129790-0034 BUT MY FRIEND I DID NOT AGREE SO MUCH
224-129790-0035 DON DIEGO STROKED HIS POINTED BLACK BEARD CAN YOU GIVE ME UNTIL MORNING FOR REFLECTION MY HEAD ACHES SO DAMNABLY THAT I AM INCAPABLE OF THOUGHT AND THIS YOU WILL ADMIT
224-129790-0036 CAPTAIN BLOOD STOOD UP FROM A SHELF HE TOOK A HALF HOUR GLASS REVERSED IT SO THAT THE BULB CONTAINING THE RED SAND WAS UPPERMOST
224-129790-0037 BUT ONE GLASS IS ALL THAT I CAN GIVE YOU
224-129790-0038 I SHALL MOST RELUCTANTLY BE DRIVEN TO ASK YOU TO GO OVER THE SIDE WITH YOUR FRIENDS CAPTAIN BLOOD BOWED WENT OUT AND LOCKED THE DOOR
224-129790-0039 AND WHAT TIME HE WATCHED THE LINES IN HIS LEAN BROWN FACE GREW DEEPER
224-129790-0040 THE SPANIARD SIGHED AND SAT UPRIGHT TO FACE THE RETURNING CAPTAIN BLOOD WITH THE ANSWER FOR WHICH HE CAME I HAVE THOUGHT OF AN ALTERNATIVE SIR CAPTAIN BUT IT DEPENDS UPON YOUR CHARITY
224-129790-0041 IT IS THAT YOU PUT US ASHORE ON ONE OF THE ISLANDS OF THIS PESTILENT ARCHIPELAGO AND LEAVE US TO SHIFT FOR OURSELVES CAPTAIN BLOOD PURSED HIS LIPS
224-129790-0042 I FEARED IT WOULD BE SO DON DIEGO SIGHED AGAIN AND STOOD UP LET US SAY NO MORE
224-129790-0043 THE SPANIARD THREW BACK HIS HEAD A FROWN BETWEEN HIS EYES
224-129790-0044 YOU DO NOT DESIRE TO LIVE AH THAT I CAN ANSWER I DO DESIRE TO LIVE AND EVEN MORE DO I DESIRE THAT MY SON MAY LIVE BUT THE DESIRE SHALL NOT MAKE A COWARD OF ME FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT MASTER MOCKER
224-129790-0045 IT WAS THE FIRST SIGN HE HAD SHOWN OF THE LEAST HEAT OR RESENTMENT
224-129790-0046 AS BEFORE HE PERCHED HIMSELF ON THE CORNER OF THE TABLE
224-129790-0047 TO EARN LIFE AND LIBERTY FOR YOURSELF YOUR SON AND THE OTHER SPANIARDS WHO ARE ON BOARD TO EARN IT SAID DON DIEGO AND THE WATCHFUL BLUE EYES DID NOT MISS THE QUIVER THAT RAN THROUGH HIM TO
224-129790-0048 EARN IT DO YOU SAY WHY IF THE SERVICE YOU WOULD PROPOSE IS ONE THAT CANNOT HURT MY HONOUR
224-129790-0049 I REALIZE THAT EVEN A PIRATE HAS HIS HONOUR AND FORTHWITH HE PROPOUNDED HIS OFFER
224-129790-0050 THAT IS THE ISLAND OF BARBADOS WELL ASTERN ALL DAY WE HAVE BEEN SAILING EAST BEFORE THE WIND WITH BUT ONE INTENT TO SET AS GREAT A DISTANCE BETWEEN BARBADOS AND OURSELVES AS POSSIBLE BUT NOW ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND WE ARE IN A DIFFICULTY
224-129790-0051 DELIRIOUS IN FACT AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN ILL TREATMENT HE RECEIVED ASHORE BEFORE WE CARRIED HIM AWAY WITH US
224-129790-0052 AND THERE ARE ONE OR TWO MEN ABOARD WHO CAN ASSIST ME BUT OF THE HIGHER MYSTERIES OF SEAMANSHIP AND OF THE ART OF FINDING A WAY OVER THE TRACKLESS WASTES OF OCEAN WE KNOW NOTHING
224-129790-0053 TO HUG THE LAND AND GO BLUNDERING ABOUT WHAT YOU SO APTLY CALL THIS PESTILENT ARCHIPELAGO IS FOR US TO COURT DISASTER AS YOU CAN PERHAPS CONCEIVE AND SO IT COMES TO THIS
224-129790-0054 WE DESIRE TO MAKE FOR THE DUTCH SETTLEMENT OF CURACAO AS STRAIGHTLY AS POSSIBLE WILL YOU PLEDGE ME YOUR HONOUR IF I RELEASE YOU UPON PAROLE THAT YOU WILL NAVIGATE US THITHER IF SO WE WILL RELEASE YOU AND YOUR SURVIVING MEN UPON ARRIVAL THERE
224-129790-0055 DON DIEGO BOWED HIS HEAD UPON HIS BREAST AND STRODE AWAY IN THOUGHT TO THE STERN WINDOWS THERE HE STOOD LOOKING OUT UPON THE SUNLIT SEA
224-129790-0056 HIS SHIP WHICH THESE ENGLISH DOGS HAD WRESTED FROM HIM HIS SHIP WHICH HE WAS ASKED TO BRING SAFELY INTO A PORT WHERE SHE WOULD BE COMPLETELY LOST TO HIM AND REFITTED PERHAPS TO MAKE WAR UPON HIS KIN THAT WAS IN ONE SCALE
224-129790-0057 IN THE OTHER WERE THE LIVES OF SIXTEEN MEN FOURTEEN OF THEM MATTERED LITTLE TO HIM BUT THE REMAINING TWO WERE HIS OWN AND HIS SON'S
