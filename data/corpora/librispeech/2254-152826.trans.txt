2254-152826-0002 BY PESTILENCE HOOCH OR LEAD I SWORE ON THE BOOK I WOULD FOLLOW AND LOOK TILL I FOUND MY TOMBLESS DEAD FOR BILL WAS A DAINTY KIND OF CUSS AND HIS MIND WAS MIGHTY SOT
2254-152826-0003 SO I PROMISED HIM AND HE PAID THE PRICE IN GOOD CHEECHAKO COIN WHICH THE SAME I BLOWED IN THAT VERY NIGHT DOWN IN THE TENDERLOIN THEN I PAINTED A THREE FOOT SLAB OF PINE
2254-152826-0004 AND I HUNG IT UP ON MY CABIN WALL
2254-152826-0005 YEARS PASSED AWAY AND AT LAST ONE DAY CAME A SQUAW WITH A STORY STRANGE OF A LONG DESERTED LINE OF TRAPS WAY BACK OF THE BIGHORN RANGE OF A LITTLE HUT BY THE GREAT DIVIDE
2254-152826-0006 AND A WHITE MAN STIFF AND STILL LYING THERE BY HIS LONESOME SELF AND I FIGURED IT MUST BE BILL SO I THOUGHT OF THE CONTRACT I'D MADE WITH HIM AND I TOOK DOWN FROM THE SHELF THE SWELL BLACK BOX WITH THE SILVER PLATE
2254-152826-0007 HE'D PICKED OUT FOR HISSELF AND I PACKED IT FULL OF GRUB AND HOOCH AND I SLUNG IT ON THE SLEIGH THEN I HARNESSED UP MY TEAM OF DOGS
2254-152826-0008 YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE IN THE YUKON WILD WHEN IT'S SIXTY NINE BELOW WHEN THE ICE WORMS WRIGGLE THEIR PURPLE HEADS THROUGH THE CRUST OF THE PALE BLUE SNOW WHEN THE PINE TREES CRACK
2254-152826-0009 OF A BIT OF STEEL BURNS LIKE A RED HOT SPIT WHEN THE MERCURY IS A FROZEN BALL AND THE FROST FIEND STALKS TO KILL WELL IT WAS JUST LIKE THAT THAT DAY WHEN I SET OUT TO LOOK FOR BILL
2254-152826-0010 OH THE AWFUL HUSH THAT SEEMED TO CRUSH ME DOWN ON EVERY HAND AS I BLUNDERED BLIND WITH A TRAIL TO FIND THROUGH THAT BLANK AND BITTER LAND HALF DAZED HALF CRAZED IN THE WINTER WILD
2254-152826-0011 WITH ITS GRIM HEART BREAKING WOES AND THE RUTHLESS STRIFE FOR A GRIP ON LIFE THAT ONLY THE SOURDOUGH KNOWS NORTH BY THE COMPASS NORTH I PRESSED RIVER AND PEAK AND PLAIN
2254-152826-0012 RIVER AND PLAIN AND MIGHTY PEAK AND WHO COULD STAND UNAWED AS THEIR SUMMITS BLAZED HE COULD STAND UNDAZED AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE OF GOD
2254-152826-0013 NORTH AYE NORTH THROUGH A LAND ACCURST SHUNNED BY THE SCOURING BRUTES AND ALL I HEARD WAS MY OWN HARSH WORD AND THE WHINE OF THE MALAMUTES TILL AT LAST I CAME TO A CABIN SQUAT
2254-152826-0014 BUILT IN THE SIDE OF A HILL AND I BURST IN THE DOOR AND THERE ON THE FLOOR FROZEN TO DEATH LAY BILL ICE WHITE ICE LIKE A WINDING SHEET SHEATHING EACH SMOKE GRIMED WALL
2254-152826-0015 ICE GLEAMING OVER ALL SPARKLING ICE ON THE DEAD MAN'S CHEST GLITTERING ICE IN HIS HAIR ICE ON HIS FINGERS ICE IN HIS HEART ICE IN HIS GLASSY STARE
2254-152826-0016 HARD AS A LOG AND TRUSSED LIKE A FROG WITH HIS ARMS AND LEGS OUTSPREAD I GAZED AT THE COFFIN I'D BROUGHT FOR HIM
2254-152826-0017 BILL LIKED HIS JOKE BUT STILL GOLDARN HIS EYES A MAN HAD OUGHT TO CONSIDER HIS MATES IN THE WAY HE GOES AND DIES HAVE YOU EVER STOOD IN AN ARCTIC HUT IN THE SHADOW OF THE POLE
2254-152826-0018 YOU MAY TRY ALL DAY BUT YOU'LL NEVER JAM ME IN I'M NOT A MAN OF THE QUITTING KIND BUT I NEVER FELT SO BLUE AS I SAT THERE GAZING AT THAT STIFF AND STUDYING WHAT I'D DO
2254-152826-0019 BUT IT DIDN'T SEEM NO GOOD HIS ARMS AND LEGS STUCK OUT LIKE PEGS
2254-152826-0020 TILL AT LAST I SAID IT AIN'T NO USE HE'S FROZE TOO HARD TO THAW HE'S OBSTINATE AND HE WON'T LIE STRAIGHT SO I GUESS I GOT TO SAW SO I SAWED OFF POOR BILL'S ARMS AND LEGS
2254-152826-0021 AND I LAID HIM SNUG AND STRAIGHT IN THE LITTLE COFFIN HE PICKED HISSELF WITH THE DINKY SILVER PLATE AND I CAME NIGH NEAR TO SHEDDING A TEAR AS I NAILED HIM SAFELY DOWN THEN I STOWED HIM AWAY
