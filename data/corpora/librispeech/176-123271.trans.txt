176-123271-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE WONDERS OF TERRESTRIAL DEPTHS AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING A RAY OF DAYLIGHT CAME TO WAKE US UP THE THOUSAND SHINING SURFACES OF LAVA ON THE WALLS RECEIVED IT ON ITS PASSAGE AND SCATTERED IT LIKE A SHOWER OF SPARKS
176-123271-0001 THERE WAS LIGHT ENOUGH TO DISTINGUISH SURROUNDING OBJECTS WELL AXEL WHAT DO YOU SAY TO IT CRIED MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS DID YOU EVER SPEND A QUIETER NIGHT IN OUR LITTLE HOUSE AT KOENIGSBERG
176-123271-0002 NO CRIES OF BASKET WOMEN NO BOATMEN SHOUTING
176-123271-0003 THERE IS SOMETHING ALARMING IN THE QUIETNESS ITSELF NOW COME MY UNCLE CRIED IF YOU ARE FRIGHTENED ALREADY
176-123271-0004 IN FACT THE MERCURY WHICH HAD RISEN IN THE INSTRUMENT AS FAST AS WE DESCENDED HAD STOPPED AT TWENTY NINE INCHES YOU SEE SAID THE PROFESSOR
176-123271-0005 WE SHALL DESCEND AT A SLOW RATE AND OUR LUNGS WILL BECOME INURED TO A DENSER ATMOSPHERE AERONAUTS FIND THE WANT OF AIR AS THEY RISE TO HIGH ELEVATIONS BUT WE SHALL PERHAPS HAVE TOO MUCH
176-123271-0006 I THEN REMEMBERED THAT WE HAD SEARCHED FOR IT IN VAIN THE EVENING BEFORE MY UNCLE QUESTIONED HANS WHO AFTER HAVING EXAMINED ATTENTIVELY WITH THE EYE OF A HUNTSMAN REPLIED
176-123271-0007 AND SO IT WAS THE BUNDLE HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY A PROJECTION A HUNDRED FEET ABOVE US IMMEDIATELY THE ICELANDER CLIMBED UP LIKE A CAT AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE PACKAGE WAS IN OUR POSSESSION NOW SAID MY UNCLE LET US BREAKFAST
176-123271-0008 BUT WE MUST LAY IN A GOOD STOCK FOR WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE MAY HAVE TO GO ON THE BISCUIT AND EXTRACT OF MEAT WERE WASHED DOWN WITH A DRAUGHT OF WATER MINGLED WITH A LITTLE GIN BREAKFAST OVER MY UNCLE DREW FROM HIS POCKET A SMALL NOTEBOOK
176-123271-0009 INTENDED FOR SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATIONS HE CONSULTED HIS INSTRUMENTS AND RECORDED
176-123271-0010 SO SAYING MY UNCLE TOOK IN ONE HAND RUHMKORFF'S APPARATUS WHICH WAS HANGING FROM HIS NECK AND WITH THE OTHER HE FORMED AN ELECTRIC COMMUNICATION WITH THE COIL IN THE LANTERN AND A SUFFICIENTLY BRIGHT LIGHT DISPERSED THE DARKNESS OF THE PASSAGE
176-123271-0011 HANS CARRIED THE OTHER APPARATUS WHICH WAS ALSO PUT INTO ACTION THIS INGENIOUS APPLICATION OF ELECTRICITY WOULD ENABLE US TO GO ON FOR A LONG TIME BY CREATING AN ARTIFICIAL LIGHT EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST INFLAMMABLE GASES NOW MARCH CRIED MY UNCLE
176-123271-0012 EACH SHOULDERED HIS PACKAGE HANS DROVE BEFORE HIM THE LOAD OF CORDS AND CLOTHES
176-123271-0013 I RAISED MY HEAD AND SAW FOR THE LAST TIME THROUGH THE LENGTH OF THAT VAST TUBE THE SKY OF ICELAND WHICH I WAS NEVER TO BEHOLD AGAIN THE LAVA IN THE LAST ERUPTION OF TWELVE TWENTY NINE HAD FORCED A PASSAGE THROUGH THIS TUNNEL
176-123271-0014 IT STILL LINED THE WALLS WITH A THICK AND GLISTENING COAT THE ELECTRIC LIGHT WAS HERE INTENSIFIED A HUNDREDFOLD BY REFLECTION THE ONLY DIFFICULTY IN PROCEEDING LAY IN NOT SLIDING TOO FAST DOWN AN INCLINE OF ABOUT FORTY FIVE DEGREES
176-123271-0015 HAPPILY CERTAIN ASPERITIES AND A FEW BLISTERINGS HERE AND THERE FORMED STEPS AND WE DESCENDED LETTING OUR BAGGAGE SLIP BEFORE US FROM THE END OF A LONG ROPE BUT THAT WHICH FORMED STEPS UNDER OUR FEET BECAME STALACTITES OVERHEAD
176-123271-0016 IT IS MAGNIFICENT I CRIED SPONTANEOUSLY MY UNCLE WHAT A SIGHT DON'T YOU ADMIRE THOSE BLENDING HUES OF LAVA PASSING FROM REDDISH BROWN TO BRIGHT YELLOW BY IMPERCEPTIBLE SHADES AND THESE CRYSTALS ARE JUST LIKE GLOBES OF LIGHT
176-123271-0017 THIS GAVE REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT OUR DESCENT WAS MORE HORIZONTAL THAN VERTICAL AS FOR THE EXACT DEPTH REACHED IT WAS VERY EASY TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE PROFESSOR MEASURED ACCURATELY THE ANGLES OF DEVIATION AND INCLINATION ON THE ROAD BUT HE KEPT THE RESULTS TO HIMSELF
176-123271-0018 ABOUT EIGHT IN THE EVENING HE SIGNALLED TO STOP HANS SAT DOWN AT ONCE THE LAMPS WERE HUNG UPON A PROJECTION IN THE LAVA WE WERE IN A SORT OF CAVERN WHERE THERE WAS PLENTY OF AIR CERTAIN PUFFS OF AIR REACHED US
176-123271-0019 WHAT ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE WAS THE CAUSE OF THEM I COULD NOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION AT THE MOMENT HUNGER AND FATIGUE MADE ME INCAPABLE OF REASONING A DESCENT OF SEVEN HOURS CONSECUTIVELY IS NOT MADE WITHOUT CONSIDERABLE EXPENDITURE OF STRENGTH I WAS EXHAUSTED
176-123271-0020 THE ORDER TO HALT THEREFORE GAVE ME PLEASURE HANS LAID OUR PROVISIONS UPON A BLOCK OF LAVA AND WE ATE WITH A GOOD APPETITE BUT ONE THING TROUBLED ME OUR SUPPLY OF WATER WAS HALF CONSUMED
176-123271-0021 MY UNCLE RECKONED UPON A FRESH SUPPLY FROM SUBTERRANEAN SOURCES BUT HITHERTO WE HAD MET WITH NONE I COULD NOT HELP DRAWING HIS ATTENTION TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE
176-123271-0022 MORE THAN THAT I AM ANXIOUS ABOUT IT WE HAVE ONLY WATER ENOUGH FOR FIVE DAYS
176-123271-0023 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE HAVE MADE NO GREAT PROGRESS VERTICALLY WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT
176-123271-0024 ACCORDING TO YOUR SYSTEM SAID MY UNCLE
176-123271-0025 THIS IS MY CONCLUSION ACCORDING TO EXACT OBSERVATIONS THE INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE IN THE INTERIOR OF THE GLOBE ADVANCES AT THE RATE OF ONE DEGREE
176-123271-0026 MOREOVER IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF AN EXTINCT VOLCANO THROUGH GNEISS
176-123271-0027 LET US THEREFORE ASSUME THIS LAST HYPOTHESIS AS THE MOST SUITABLE TO OUR SITUATION AND CALCULATE
176-123271-0028 DO CALCULATE MY BOY NOTHING IS EASIER SAID I PUTTING DOWN FIGURES IN MY NOTE BOOK NINE TIMES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET GIVES A DEPTH OF ELEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET VERY ACCURATE INDEED WELL
176-123271-0029 IS THAT POSSIBLE YES OR FIGURES ARE OF NO USE THE PROFESSOR'S CALCULATIONS WERE QUITE CORRECT
176-123271-0030 SUCH AS THE MINES OF KITZ BAHL IN TYROL AND THOSE OF WUTTEMBOURG IN BOHEMIA
