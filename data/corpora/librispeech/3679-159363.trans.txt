3679-159363-0000 IN THE DAYS OF THE GREAT PRINCE ARTHUR THERE LIVED A MIGHTY MAGICIAN CALLED MERLIN THE MOST LEARNED AND SKILLFUL ENCHANTER THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN
3679-159363-0001 THIS FAMOUS MAGICIAN WHO COULD TAKE ANY FORM HE PLEASED WAS TRAVELING ABOUT AS A POOR BEGGAR AND BEING VERY TIRED HE STOPPED AT THE COTTAGE OF A PLOWMAN TO REST HIMSELF AND ASKED FOR SOME FOOD
3679-159363-0002 THE COUNTRYMAN BADE HIM WELCOME AND HIS WIFE WHO WAS A VERY GOOD HEARTED WOMAN SOON BROUGHT HIM SOME MILK IN A WOODEN BOWL AND SOME COARSE BROWN BREAD ON A PLATTER
3679-159363-0003 BUT HE COULD NOT HELP NOTICING THAT THOUGH EVERYTHING WAS NEAT AND COMFORTABLE IN THE COTTAGE THEY BOTH SEEMED TO BE VERY UNHAPPY HE THEREFORE ASKED THEM WHY THEY WERE SO MELANCHOLY AND LEARNED THAT THEY WERE MISERABLE BECAUSE THEY HAD NO CHILDREN THE POOR WOMAN SAID
3679-159363-0004 I SHOULD BE THE HAPPIEST CREATURE IN THE WORLD IF I HAD A SON ALTHOUGH HE WAS NO BIGGER THAN MY HUSBAND'S THUMB I WOULD BE SATISFIED MERLIN WAS SO MUCH AMUSED WITH THE IDEA OF A BOY NO BIGGER THAN A MAN'S THUMB THAT HE DETERMINED TO GRANT THE POOR WOMAN'S WISH
3679-159363-0005 ACCORDINGLY IN A SHORT TIME AFTER THE PLOWMAN'S WIFE HAD A SON WHO WONDERFUL TO RELATE WAS NOT A BIT BIGGER THAN HIS FATHER'S THUMB THE QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES WISHING TO SEE THE LITTLE FELLOW
3679-159363-0006 CAME IN AT THE WINDOW WHILE THE MOTHER WAS SITTING UP IN THE BED ADMIRING HIM THE QUEEN KISSED THE CHILD AND GIVING IT THE NAME OF TOM THUMB

3679-159363-0014 THE BATTER FILLED TOM'S MOUTH AND PREVENTED HIM FROM CRYING BUT ON FEELING THE HOT WATER HE KICKED AND STRUGGLED SO MUCH IN THE POT THAT HIS MOTHER THOUGHT THAT THE PUDDING WAS BEWITCHED AND PULLING IT OUT OF THE POT SHE THREW IT OUTSIDE THE DOOR A
