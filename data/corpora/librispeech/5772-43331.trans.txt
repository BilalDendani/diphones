5772-43331-0000 HE HAD SEEN FROM HIS WINDOWS IN WHITEHALL PARLIAMENT SQUARE FILLED WITH A MOB THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NOT BEEN KNOWN IN ENGLAND SINCE THE DAYS OF CHRISTIANITY A MOB FULL OF A FURY THAT COULD SCARCELY DRAW ITS ORIGIN
5772-43331-0001 EXCEPT FROM SOURCES BEYOND THE REACH OF SENSE THRICE DURING THE HOURS THAT FOLLOWED THE PUBLICATION OF THE CATHOLIC PLOT AND THE OUTBREAK OF MOB LAW HE HAD COMMUNICATED WITH THE PRIME MINISTER ASKING WHETHER NOTHING COULD BE DONE TO ALLAY THE TUMULT AND ON BOTH OCCASIONS
5772-43331-0002 THAT WHAT COULD BE DONE WOULD BE DONE THAT FORCE WAS INADMISSIBLE AT PRESENT BUT THAT THE POLICE WERE DOING ALL THAT WAS POSSIBLE AS REGARDED THE DESPATCH OF THE VOLORS TO ROME HE HAD ASSENTED BY SILENCE AS HAD THE REST OF THE COUNCIL
5772-43331-0003 AS HE PASSED IN ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT VOLORS OVER LONDON ON HIS WAY HOME HE HAD CAUGHT MORE THAN ONE GLIMPSE OF WHAT WAS PROCEEDING BENEATH HIM THE STREETS WERE AS BRIGHT AS DAY SHADOWLESS AND CLEAR IN THE WHITE LIGHT
5772-43331-0004 AND EVERY ROADWAY WAS A CRAWLING SERPENT FROM BENEATH ROSE UP A STEADY ROAR OF VOICES SOFT AND WOOLLY PUNCTUATED BY CRIES FROM HERE AND THERE ASCENDED THE SMOKE OF BURNING AND ONCE AS HE FLITTED OVER ONE OF THE GREAT SQUARES
5772-43331-0005 TO THE SOUTH OF BATTERSEA HE HAD SEEN AS IT WERE A SCATTERED SQUADRON OF ANTS
5772-43331-0006 HE KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING WELL AFTER ALL MAN WAS NOT YET PERFECTLY CIVILISED HE DID NOT LIKE TO THINK OF WHAT AWAITED HIM AT HOME ONCE ABOUT FIVE HOURS EARLIER HE HAD LISTENED TO HIS WIFE'S VOICE THROUGH THE TELEPHONE
5772-43331-0007 AND WHAT HE HAD HEARD HAD NEARLY CAUSED HIM TO LEAVE ALL AND GO TO HER YET HE WAS SCARCELY PREPARED FOR WHAT HE FOUND AS HE CAME INTO THE SITTING ROOM THERE WAS NO SOUND EXCEPT THAT FAR AWAY HUM FROM THE SEETHING STREETS BELOW THE ROOM SEEMED STRANGELY DARK AND COLD
5772-43331-0008 HE PASSED ACROSS TO THE WINDOW CLOSED IT AND DREW THE CURTAINS THEN HE TOOK THAT RIGID FIGURE GENTLY BY THE ARM MABEL HE SAID MABEL SHE SUBMITTED TO BE DRAWN TOWARDS THE SOFA BUT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE TO HIS TOUCH
5772-43331-0009 HE SAT DOWN AND LOOKED UP AT HER WITH A KIND OF DESPAIRING APPREHENSION MY DEAR I AM TIRED OUT HE SAID STILL SHE LOOKED AT HIM THERE WAS IN HER POSE THAT RIGIDITY THAT ACTORS SIMULATE YET HE KNEW IT FOR THE REAL THING
5772-43331-0010 HE HAD SEEN THAT SILENCE ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE IN THE PRESENCE OF A HORROR ONCE AT ANY RATE AT THE SIGHT OF A SPLASH OF BLOOD ON HER SHOE WELL MY DARLING SIT DOWN AT LEAST HE SAID SHE OBEYED HIM MECHANICALLY
5772-43331-0011 HER LOYALTY TO HER FAITH AND HER HATRED OF THOSE CRIMES IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE AS HE LOOKED ON HER HE SAW THAT THESE TWO WERE AT DEATH GRIPS THAT HATRED WAS PREVAILING AND THAT SHE HERSELF WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A PASSIVE BATTLEFIELD
5772-43331-0012 THEN AS WITH A LONG DRAWN HOWL OF A WOLF THERE SURGED AND SANK THE VOICES OF THE MOB A MILE AWAY THE TENSION BROKE SHE THREW HERSELF FORWARD TOWARDS HIM HE CAUGHT HER BY THE WRISTS AND SO SHE RESTED
5772-43331-0013 CLASPED IN HIS ARMS HER FACE AND BOSOM ON HIS KNEES AND HER WHOLE BODY TORN BY EMOTION FOR A FULL MINUTE NEITHER SPOKE OLIVER UNDERSTOOD WELL ENOUGH YET AT PRESENT HE HAD NO WORDS HE ONLY DREW HER A LITTLE CLOSER TO HIMSELF
5772-43331-0014 KISSED HER HAIR TWO OR THREE TIMES AND SETTLED HIMSELF TO HOLD HER HE BEGAN TO REHEARSE WHAT HE MUST SAY PRESENTLY THEN SHE RAISED HER FLUSHED FACE FOR AN INSTANT LOOKED AT HIM PASSIONATELY DROPPED HER HEAD AGAIN AND BEGAN TO SOB OUT BROKEN WORDS
5772-43331-0015 HE COULD ONLY CATCH A SENTENCE HERE AND THERE YET HE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS SAYING IT WAS THE RUIN OF ALL HER HOPES SHE SOBBED THE END OF HER RELIGION LET HER DIE DIE AND HAVE DONE WITH IT IT WAS ALL GONE GONE
5772-43331-0016 SWEPT AWAY IN THIS MURDEROUS PASSION OF THE PEOPLE OF HER FAITH THEY WERE NO BETTER THAN CHRISTIANS AFTER ALL AS FIERCE AS THE MEN ON WHOM THEY AVENGED THEMSELVES AS DARK AS THOUGH THE SAVIOUR JULIAN HAD NEVER COME IT WAS ALL LOST
5772-43331-0017 THE BURNING CHURCHES AND CONVENTS ALL STREAMED OUT INCOHERENT BROKEN BY SOBS DETAILS OF HORROR LAMENTATIONS REPROACHES INTERPRETED BY THE WRITHING OF HER HEAD AND HANDS UPON HIS KNEES THE COLLAPSE WAS COMPLETE
5772-43331-0018 HE PUT HIS HANDS AGAIN BENEATH HER ARMS AND RAISED HER HE WAS WORN OUT BY HIS WORK YET HE KNEW HE MUST QUIET HER THIS WAS MORE SERIOUS THAN ANY PREVIOUS CRISIS YET HE KNEW HER POWER OF RECOVERY SIT DOWN MY DARLING HE SAID

5772-43331-0020 MEN WERE NOT YET PERFECT HE SAID THERE RAN IN THEIR VEINS THE BLOOD OF MEN WHO FOR TWENTY CENTURIES HAD BEEN CHRISTIANS THERE MUST BE NO DESPAIR FAITH IN MAN WAS OF THE VERY ESSENCE OF RELIGION FAITH IN MAN'S BEST SELF IN WHAT HE WOULD BECOME
5772-43331-0021 NOT IN WHAT AT PRESENT HE ACTUALLY WAS THEY WERE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW RELIGION NOT IN ITS MATURITY THERE MUST BE SOURNESS IN THE YOUNG FRUIT CONSIDER TOO THE PROVOCATION REMEMBER THE APPALLING CRIME THAT THESE CATHOLICS HAD CONTEMPLATED
5772-43331-0022 THEY HAD SET THEMSELVES TO STRIKE THE NEW FAITH IN ITS VERY HEART MY DARLING HE SAID MEN ARE NOT CHANGED IN AN INSTANT WHAT IF THOSE CHRISTIANS HAD SUCCEEDED
5772-43331-0023 BUT WHAT DOES FAITH MEAN EXCEPT THAT WE KNOW THAT MERCY WILL PREVAIL FAITH PATIENCE AND HOPE THESE ARE OUR WEAPONS HE SPOKE WITH PASSIONATE CONVICTION HIS EYES FIXED ON HERS
5772-43331-0024 IN A FIERCE ENDEAVOUR TO GIVE HER HIS OWN CONFIDENCE AND TO REASSURE THE REMNANTS OF HIS OWN DOUBTFULNESS IT WAS TRUE THAT HE TOO HATED WHAT SHE HATED YET HE SAW THINGS THAT SHE DID NOT WELL WELL HE TOLD HIMSELF HE MUST REMEMBER THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN
5772-43331-0025 THE LOOK OF FRANTIC HORROR PASSED SLOWLY OUT OF HER EYES GIVING WAY TO ACUTE MISERY AS HE TALKED AND AS HIS PERSONALITY ONCE MORE BEGAN TO DOMINATE HER OWN BUT IT WAS NOT YET OVER BUT THE VOLORS SHE CRIED THE VOLORS
5772-43331-0026 THAT IS DELIBERATE THAT IS NOT THE WORK OF THE MOB MY DARLING IT IS NO MORE DELIBERATE THAN THE OTHER WE ARE ALL HUMAN WE ARE ALL IMMATURE YES THE COUNCIL PERMITTED IT PERMITTED IT REMEMBER
