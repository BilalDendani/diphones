3185-163505-0013 SO HE CAUGHT HER UP AND HELD HER UP TO THE EDGE OF THE CASK WHILE SHE DRANK AS FOR HIMSELF HE CLAMBERED UP AND HUNG DOWN LIKE A CAT INSIDE THE CASK WHILE HE DRANK SO WHEN HE HAD QUENCHED HIS THIRST HE TOOK UP THE CASK AND PUT IT BACK ON THE TABLE AND THANKED THE MAN FOR THE GOOD MEAL

3185-163505-0018 TWILL NEVER DO TO GO TO SLEEP YET I'D BEST LIE AWAKE AND LISTEN HOW THINGS GO AS THE NIGHT WEARS ON
3185-163505-0019 HE WOULD JUST SAY HE WISHED THE OLD DAME WOULD STAY AND KEEP HOUSE FOR HIM A DAY OR TWO AND THEN HE WOULD TAKE THE LAD OUT WITH HIM
3185-163505-0020 AND ROLL DOWN A GREAT ROCK ON HIM ALL THIS THE LAD LAY AND LISTENED TO NEXT DAY THE TROLL FOR IT WAS A TROLL AS CLEAR AS DAY ASKED IF THE OLD DAME WOULD STAY AND KEEP HOUSE FOR HIM A FEW DAYS AND AS THE DAY WENT ON HE TOOK A GREAT IRON CROWBAR

3185-163505-0026 TILL THERE WASN'T A BIT OF HIM LEFT BUT THE TWO PAWS SO WHEN THE REST SAW THAT THEY WERE SO AFRAID THAT THEY CREPT UP AND LAY AT HIS FEET LIKE SO MANY CURS AFTER THAT THEY FOLLOWED HIM ABOUT WHEREVER HE WENT

3185-163505-0031 BUT UP ROSE THE LIONS AND TORE THE TROLLS INTO SMALL PIECES SO THAT THE PLACE LOOKED AS IF A DUNG HEAP HAD BEEN TOSSED ABOUT IT AND WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED THE TROLLS THEY LAY DOWN AGAIN
3185-163505-0032 THE LAD DID NOT WAKE TILL LATE IN THE AFTERNOON AND WHEN HE GOT ON HIS KNEES AND RUBBED THE SLEEP OUT OF HIS EYES HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT HAD BEEN GOING ON WHEN HE SAW THE MARKS OF HOOFS BUT WHEN HE WENT TOWARDS THE CASTLE A MAIDEN LOOKED OUT OF A WINDOW WHO HAD SEEN ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED
3185-163505-0033 AND SHE SAID YOU MAY THANK YOUR STARS YOU WEREN'T IN THAT TUSSLE ELSE YOU MUST HAVE LOST YOUR LIFE WHAT I LOSE MY LIFE NO FEAR OF THAT I THINK SAID THE LAD SO SHE BEGGED HIM TO COME IN THAT SHE MIGHT TALK WITH HIM

3185-163505-0044 AT LAST ONE DAY THE BIGGEST LION WAS CHASING A HARE WHICH WAS BLIND FOR IT RAN STRAIGHT OVER STOCK AND STONE AND THE END WAS IT RAN RIGHT UP AGAINST A FIR STUMP AND TUMBLED HEAD OVER HEELS ACROSS THE FIELD RIGHT INTO A SPRING BUT LO WHEN IT CAME OUT OF THE SPRING
3185-163505-0045 IT SAW ITS WAY QUITE PLAIN AND SO SAVED ITS LIFE SO SO THOUGHT THE LION
3185-163505-0046 SO WHEN HE HAD GOT HIS SIGHT AGAIN HE WENT DOWN TO THE SHORE AND MADE SIGNS TO THE LIONS THAT THEY SHOULD ALL LIE CLOSE TOGETHER LIKE A RAFT THEN HE STOOD UPON THEIR BACKS WHILE THEY SWAM WITH HIM TO THE MAINLAND WHEN HE HAD REACHED THE SHORE HE WENT UP INTO A BIRCHEN COPSE
3185-163505-0047 AND MADE THE LIONS LIE QUIET THEN HE STOLE UP TO THE CASTLE LIKE A THIEF TO SEE IF HE COULDN'T LAY HANDS ON HIS BELT AND WHEN HE GOT TO THE DOOR HE PEEPED THROUGH THE KEYHOLE AND THERE HE SAW HIS BELT HANGING UP OVER A DOOR IN THE KITCHEN

3185-163505-0050 AND SO HE BURNED OUT THE TROLL'S EYES AND TURNED HIM ADRIFT ON THE SEA IN A LITTLE BOAT BUT HE HAD NO LIONS TO FOLLOW HIM NOW THE LAD WAS ALL ALONE AND HE WENT ABOUT LONGING AND LONGING FOR THE PRINCESS AT LAST HE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER HE MUST SET OUT TO SEEK HER
3185-163505-0051 HIS HEART WAS SO BENT ON HAVING HER SO HE LOADED FOUR SHIPS AND SET SAIL FOR ARABIA FOR SOME TIME THEY HAD FAIR WIND AND FINE WEATHER BUT AFTER THAT THEY LAY WIND BOUND UNDER A ROCKY ISLAND SO THE SAILORS WENT ASHORE AND STROLLED ABOUT TO SPEND THE TIME
3185-163505-0052 HE THOUGHT IT A TRIFLE TO CRACK IT SO HE GAVE IT ONE BLOW AND THE EGG SPLIT AND OUT CAME A CHICKEN AS BIG AS AN ELEPHANT NOW WE HAVE DONE WRONG SAID THE LAD THIS CAN COST US ALL OUR LIVES
3185-163505-0053 AND THEN HE ASKED HIS SAILORS IF THEY WERE MEN ENOUGH TO SAIL TO ARABIA IN FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS IF THEY GOT A FINE BREEZE YES THEY WERE GOOD TO DO THAT THEY SAID SO THEY SET SAIL WITH A FINE BREEZE AND GOT TO ARABIA IN THREE AND TWENTY HOURS
3185-163505-0054 AS SOON AS THEY LANDED THE LAD ORDERED ALL THE SAILORS TO GO AND BURY THEMSELVES UP TO THE EYES IN A SANDHILL SO THAT THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE SHIPS THE LAD AND THE CAPTAINS CLIMBED A HIGH CRAG AND SATE DOWN UNDER A FIR IN A LITTLE WHILE CAME A GREAT BIRD FLYING WITH AN ISLAND IN ITS CLAWS

3185-163505-0057 AT LAST THE NEWS CAME TO THE KING'S EARS THAT THERE NEVER HAD BEEN SUCH FUN IN THE TOWN BEFORE FOR HERE WAS A WHITE BEAR THAT DANCED AND CUT CAPERS JUST AS IT WAS BID
3185-163505-0058 FOR THE KING WANTED TO SEE ITS TRICKS

3185-163505-0064 IN HIS HAND AND A BIG BUNCH OF KEYS AND CARRIED OFF THE WHITE BEAR HE PASSED ALONG GALLERY AFTER GALLERY THROUGH DOORS AND ROOMS
3185-163505-0065 HE CAME TO A PIER WHICH RAN OUT INTO THE SEA THEN THE KING BEGAN TO PULL AND HAUL AT POSTS AND PINS THIS ONE UP AND THAT ONE DOWN
3185-163505-0066 THERE HE KEPT HIS DAUGHTER FOR SHE WAS SO DEAR TO HIM THAT HE HAD HID HER SO THAT NO ONE COULD FIND HER OUT HE LEFT THE WHITE BEAR OUTSIDE WHILE HE WENT IN AND TOLD HER HOW IT HAD DANCED AND PLAYED ITS PRANKS SHE SAID SHE WAS AFRAID AND DARED NOT LOOK AT IT
