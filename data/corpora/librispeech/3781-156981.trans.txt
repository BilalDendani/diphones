3781-156981-0000 ISRAEL'S EXPERIENCE IN THE WILDERNESS AND EAST OF THE JORDAN
3781-156981-0001 THEN AS THEY JOURNEYED FROM THE MOUNTAIN OF JEHOVAH THE ARK OF JEHOVAH WENT BEFORE THEM TO SEEK OUT A HALTING PLACE FOR THEM AND WHENEVER THE ARK STARTED MOSES WOULD SAY ARISE O JEHOVAH
3781-156981-0002 AND LET THINE ENEMIES BE SCATTERED AND LET THOSE WHO HATE THEE FLEE BEFORE THEE AND WHEN IT RESTED HE WOULD SAY RETURN O JEHOVAH TO THE TEN THOUSAND OF THOUSANDS OF ISRAEL
3781-156981-0003 THIRTY THREE THIRTY FIVE THIRTY SIX AS AN EAGLE STIRRETH UP HER NEST HOVERETH OVER HER YOUNG TAKETH THEM BEARETH THEM UPON HER WINGS SO THE LORD HIS GOD DID LEAD HIM AND THERE WAS NO STRANGE GOD WITH HIM
3781-156981-0004 BEFORE MAN MADE US CITIZENS GREAT NATURE MADE US MEN LOWELL OH EAST IS EAST AND WEST IS WEST AND NEVER THE TWAIN SHALL MEET
3781-156981-0005 TILL EARTH AND SKY STAND PRESENTLY AT GOD'S GREAT JUDGMENT SEAT BUT THERE IS NEITHER EAST NOR WEST BORDER NOR BREED NOR BIRTH WHEN TWO STRONG MEN STAND FACE TO FACE
3781-156981-0006 THO THEY COME FROM THE ENDS OF THE EARTH RUDYARD KIPLING THE MEASURE OF THE SUCCESS OF OUR LIVES CAN ONLY LIE IN THE STATURE OF OUR MANHOOD IN THE GROWTH IN UNWORLDLINESS AND IN THE MORAL ELEVATION OF OUR INNER SELF
3781-156981-0007 THE ACCOUNTS REGARDING THE EXPERIENCES OF THE ISRAELITES IN THE WILDERNESS LACK THE UNITY WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE RECORDS OF THE EARLIER AND LATER PERIODS THEY SIMPLY GIVE OCCASIONAL PICTURES OF THE LIFE OF THE HEBREW FUGITIVES
3781-156981-0008 THEY MUST BE INTERPRETED IN THE LIGHT OF THE PECULIAR BACKGROUND OF THE WILDERNESS AND OF THE NOMADIC LIFE WHICH FLOURISHES THERE TO DAY AS IT DID IN THE PAST THE HEBREWS ON ESCAPING FROM EGYPT
3781-156981-0009 ENTERED THE SOUTH COUNTRY WHICH EXTENDS SEVENTY MILES FROM THE ROCKY HILLS OF JUDAH SOUTHWARD UNTIL IT MERGES INTO THE BARREN DESERT DURING THE LATER ROMAN PERIOD THE NORTHERN AND NORTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THIS TERRITORY
3781-156981-0010 WERE PARTIALLY RECLAIMED BY AGRICULTURALISTS BUT IN EARLY PERIODS AS TO DAY IT WAS PRE EMINENTLY THE HOME OF WANDERING NOMADIC TRIBES
3781-156981-0011 THIS WILD TREELESS REGION IS DIVIDED BY ROCKY RANGES RUNNING FROM EAST TO WEST PARALLEL TO THESE ARE DEEP HOT AND FOR THE MOST PART WATERLESS VALLEYS IN THE SPRINGTIME
3781-156981-0012 THE HOME OF THE HEBREWS AT THIS TIME LIKE THAT OF THE MODERN ARABS WAS THE TENT THE STORIES THAT HAVE COME DOWN FROM THIS PERIOD SUGGEST THE EXPERIENCES THROUGH WHICH THEY PASSED THE CONSTANT INSISTENT PROBLEM IN THIS REGION WAS AND IS
3781-156981-0013 HOW TO SECURE ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF FOOD AND WATER DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE YEAR THE CHIEF FOOD OF THE PEOPLE IS THE MILK AND CURDS SUPPLIED BY THEIR HERDS AT TIMES HOWEVER
3781-156981-0014 THESE FAIL TO MEET THE NEEDS EVEN OF THE MODERN BEDOUIN INHABITANTS OF THIS SOUTH COUNTRY THEY THEN GATHER THE GUM THAT EXUDES FROM THE TAMARISK TREE OR THE LICHENS FROM THE ROCKS
3781-156981-0015 FROM THESE THEY MAKE A COARSE FLOUR AND BREAD WHICH KEEPS THEM ALIVE UNTIL THE WINTER RAINS AGAIN BRING THEIR SUPPLY OF WATER AND PASTURAGE SOME SCHOLARS HOLD THAT THIS COARSE FOOD WAS THE MANNA OF THE BIBLICAL ACCOUNTS
3781-156981-0016 THEY ARGUE THAT LATER GENERATIONS FAMILIAR WITH THE BARRENNESS OF THE WILDERNESS AND BELIEVING THAT THE HEBREWS AT THIS TIME NUMBERED MANY THOUSANDS
3781-156981-0017 AT CERTAIN PERIODS ALSO THE MEAGRE FARE OF THE DESERT DWELLER IS SUPPLEMENTED BY THE QUAILS WHICH HE IS ABLE TO CAPTURE AND THESE ARE A WELCOME RELIEF TO HIS MONOTONOUS DIET ABOUT THE PERENNIAL SPRINGS
3781-156981-0018 EVEN IN MORE FERTILE LANDS THE GREEKS REARED BESIDE SUCH SPRINGS TEMPLES TO THE GOD WHOM THEY THOUGHT OF AS THUS SIGNALLY REVEALING HIMSELF IN THE DEEPER SENSE EACH OF THESE EARLY HEBREW STORIES IS HISTORICAL
3781-156981-0019 FOR THEY ALL RECORD THE FUNDAMENTAL THOUGHT AND BELIEF THAT THROUGH THIS STRENUOUS PAINFUL PERIOD EVEN AS IN LATER CRISES IN THEIR HISTORY JEHOVAH WAS GUIDING HIS PEOPLE AND GIVING THEM NOT ONLY FOOD AND WATER
3781-156981-0020 BUT ALSO THAT TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL OF DANGER AND PRIVATION WHICH WAS ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR HIGHEST DEVELOPMENT
3781-156981-0021 EVEN MORE INSISTENT THAN THE CONSTANT STRUGGLE FOR FOOD AND WATER WERE THE DANGERS THAT CAME FROM THE HOSTILE TRIBES WHICH ALREADY OCCUPIED THIS MUCH CONTESTED TERRITORY FOR THE POSSESSION OF THE SPRINGS AND PASTURE LANDS THEY FOUGHT
3781-156981-0022 WITH THE ENERGY AND CRAFT THAT CHARACTERIZE THE BEDOUIN TRIBES TO DAY HENCE TO THE HEBREWS FRESH FROM THE FERTILE FIELDS OF EGYPT THEIR LIFE IN THE WILDERNESS REPRESENTED CONSTANT HARDSHIP PRIVATION
3781-156981-0023 OV THE NOMADIC LIFE UPON ISRAEL'S CHARACTER AND IDEALS THE WILDERNESS LEFT A STAMP UPON HEBREW CHARACTER AND LIFE THAT MAY BE TRACED EVEN TO DAY IN THE LATER DESCENDANTS OF THAT RACE
3781-156981-0024 IT TIGHTENED THEIR MUSCLES AND GAVE THEM THAT PHYSICAL VIRILITY WHICH HAS ENABLED THEM TO SURVIVE EVEN AMIDST THE MOST UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS IT TAUGHT THEM HOW TO SUBSIST ON THE MOST MEAGRE FOOD SUPPLY
3781-156981-0025 AND TO THRIVE WHERE THE CITIZEN OF A MORE PROSPEROUS LAND WOULD INEVITABLY STARVE IT IS PROBABLE THAT IN THEIR EARLY NOMADIC EXPERIENCES THE HEBREWS ACQUIRED THOSE MIGRATORY HABITS
3781-156981-0026 WHICH INTENSIFIED BY UNWONTED VICISSITUDES HAVE CARRIED THEM TO ALMOST EVERY CIVILIZED LAND IN THE WILDERNESS THEY ALSO LEARNED THE ART OF NOMADIC WARFARE
3781-156981-0027 WHICH TO WIN VICTORIES DEPENDED NOT SO MUCH UPON OPEN ATTACK AS UPON STRATEGY THE COMMON DANGERS OF THE WILDERNESS LIFE TIGHTENED THE RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS BONDS THAT HELD THEM TOGETHER
3781-156981-0028 ONLY BY THE CLOSEST UNION COULD THEY RESIST THE PERILS THAT BESET THEM UPON THE COMPLETE DEVOTION OF EACH MAN TO THE INTEREST OF THE TRIBE HUNG HIS FATE AS WELL AS THAT OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE
3781-156981-0029 EVEN IF IT COST THE LIFE BLOOD OF THE TRIBE WHICH IS ILLUSTRATED IN MANY OF THE STORIES THAT COME FROM THIS EARLY PERIOD HOW FAR HAS THIS RACIAL CHARACTERISTIC SURVIVED
3781-156981-0030 BY PUBLIC STONING HOW FAR HAS THIS CHARACTERISTIC SURVIVED TO THE GLORY OF THE JEWISH RACE THE TRIBAL ORGANIZATION ALSO CHERISHED THE FREEDOM OF EACH INDIVIDUAL
3781-156981-0031 UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A NEW AGRICULTURAL ENVIRONMENT THE HEBREWS ESTABLISHED THE KINGSHIP AND MONARCHY IT WAS THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THESE INHERITED DEMOCRATIC IDEALS AND THOSE OF THE NEIGHBORS WHO WERE RULED BY DESPOTS
3781-156981-0032 THAT ULTIMATELY DISRUPTED THE HEBREW KINGDOM AND CALLED FORTH THOSE GREAT CHAMPIONS OF LIBERTY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE THE PROPHETS OF THE ASSYRIAN PERIOD
3781-156981-0033 IT WAS THIS SAME DEMOCRATIC ATMOSPHERE THAT MADE POSSIBLE THE WORK OF THOSE PROPHETS WHO OPENLY DENOUNCED THE CRIMES OF KING AND PEOPLE HOW FAR HAVE THE JEWS THROUGHOUT ALL THEIR HISTORY
3781-156981-0034 UPON A POWER OUTSIDE AND ABOVE THEMSELVES IT LED THEM TO LOOK CONSTANTLY TO JEHOVAH AS THEIR SOLE GUIDE AND DELIVERER A CONTINUED ATTITUDE CRYSTALLIZED INTO A HABIT HENCE THROUGHOUT THEIR TROUBLED CAREER
3781-156981-0035 THE HEBREWS HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND HAVE FOUND IN HIM THEIR DEFENDER AND PERSONAL FRIEND AS HAS NO OTHER PEOPLE IN HUMAN HISTORY
