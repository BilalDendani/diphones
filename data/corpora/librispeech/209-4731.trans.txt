209-4731-0000 FROM HIS FORTUNE HIS HOUSE AND HIS DAUGHTER HE COULD COMMAND THE VISITS OF HIS OWN LITTLE CIRCLE IN A GREAT MEASURE AS HE LIKED HE HAD NOT MUCH INTERCOURSE WITH ANY FAMILIES BEYOND THAT CIRCLE HIS HORROR OF LATE HOURS AND LARGE DINNER PARTIES
209-4731-0001 MADE HIM UNFIT FOR ANY ACQUAINTANCE BUT SUCH AS WOULD VISIT HIM ON HIS OWN TERMS FORTUNATELY FOR HIM HIGHBURY INCLUDING RANDALLS IN THE SAME PARISH AND DONWELL ABBEY IN THE PARISH ADJOINING THE SEAT OF MISTER KNIGHTLEY
209-4731-0002 COMPREHENDED MANY SUCH NOT UNFREQUENTLY THROUGH EMMA'S PERSUASION HE HAD SOME OF THE CHOSEN AND THE BEST TO DINE WITH HIM BUT EVENING PARTIES WERE WHAT HE PREFERRED AND UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY
209-4731-0003 THERE WAS SCARCELY AN EVENING IN THE WEEK IN WHICH EMMA COULD NOT MAKE UP A CARD TABLE FOR HIM REAL LONG STANDING REGARD BROUGHT THE WESTONS AND MISTER KNIGHTLEY AND BY MISTER ELTON A YOUNG MAN LIVING ALONE WITHOUT LIKING IT
209-4731-0004 THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE FOR THE ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MISTER WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING ROOM AND THE SMILES OF HIS LOVELY DAUGHTER WAS IN NO DANGER OF BEING THROWN AWAY
209-4731-0005 AFTER THESE CAME A SECOND SET AMONG THE MOST COME AT ABLE OF WHOM WERE MISSUS AND MISS BATES AND MISSUS GODDARD THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD
209-4731-0006 AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN THAT MISTER WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES
209-4731-0007 MISSUS BATES THE WIDOW OF A FORMER VICAR OF HIGHBURY WAS A VERY OLD LADY ALMOST PAST EVERY THING BUT TEA AND QUADRILLE SHE LIVED WITH HER SINGLE DAUGHTER IN A VERY SMALL WAY
209-4731-0008 AND WAS CONSIDERED WITH ALL THE REGARD AND RESPECT WHICH A HARMLESS OLD LADY UNDER SUCH UNTOWARD CIRCUMSTANCES CAN EXCITE HER DAUGHTER ENJOYED A MOST UNCOMMON DEGREE OF POPULARITY
209-4731-0009 MISS BATES STOOD IN THE VERY WORST PREDICAMENT IN THE WORLD FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF OR FRIGHTEN THOSE WHO MIGHT HATE HER INTO OUTWARD RESPECT
209-4731-0010 SHE HAD NEVER BOASTED EITHER BEAUTY OR CLEVERNESS HER YOUTH HAD PASSED WITHOUT DISTINCTION AND HER MIDDLE OF LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE CARE OF A FAILING MOTHER AND THE ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE A SMALL INCOME GO AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
209-4731-0011 AND YET SHE WAS A HAPPY WOMAN AND A WOMAN WHOM NO ONE NAMED WITHOUT GOOD WILL IT WAS HER OWN UNIVERSAL GOOD WILL AND CONTENTED TEMPER WHICH WORKED SUCH WONDERS SHE LOVED EVERY BODY
209-4731-0012 WAS INTERESTED IN EVERY BODY'S HAPPINESS QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER AND SO MANY GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS AND A HOME THAT WANTED FOR NOTHING
209-4731-0013 THE SIMPLICITY AND CHEERFULNESS OF HER NATURE HER CONTENTED AND GRATEFUL SPIRIT WERE A RECOMMENDATION TO EVERY BODY AND A MINE OF FELICITY TO HERSELF SHE WAS A GREAT TALKER UPON LITTLE MATTERS
209-4731-0014 OR ANY THING WHICH PROFESSED IN LONG SENTENCES OF REFINED NONSENSE TO COMBINE LIBERAL ACQUIREMENTS WITH ELEGANT MORALITY UPON NEW PRINCIPLES AND NEW SYSTEMS
209-4731-0015 BUT A REAL HONEST OLD FASHIONED BOARDING SCHOOL
209-4731-0016 FOR HIGHBURY WAS RECKONED A PARTICULARLY HEALTHY SPOT SHE HAD AN AMPLE HOUSE AND GARDEN GAVE THE CHILDREN PLENTY OF WHOLESOME FOOD LET THEM RUN ABOUT A GREAT DEAL IN THE SUMMER AND IN WINTER DRESSED THEIR CHILBLAINS WITH HER OWN HANDS IT WAS NO WONDER
209-4731-0017 THAT A TRAIN OF TWENTY YOUNG COUPLE NOW WALKED AFTER HER TO CHURCH SHE WAS A PLAIN MOTHERLY KIND OF WOMAN WHO HAD WORKED HARD IN HER YOUTH AND NOW THOUGHT HERSELF ENTITLED TO THE OCCASIONAL HOLIDAY OF A TEA VISIT
209-4731-0018 AND HAVING FORMERLY OWED MUCH TO MISTER WOODHOUSE'S KINDNESS FELT HIS PARTICULAR CLAIM ON HER TO LEAVE HER NEAT PARLOUR HUNG ROUND WITH FANCY WORK WHENEVER SHE COULD AND WIN OR LOSE A FEW SIXPENCES BY HIS FIRESIDE
209-4731-0019 THESE WERE THE LADIES WHOM EMMA FOUND HERSELF VERY FREQUENTLY ABLE TO COLLECT AND HAPPY WAS SHE FOR HER FATHER'S SAKE IN THE POWER THOUGH AS FAR AS SHE WAS HERSELF CONCERNED IT WAS NO REMEDY FOR THE ABSENCE OF MISSUS WESTON
209-4731-0020 SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HER FATHER LOOK COMFORTABLE AND VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH HERSELF FOR CONTRIVING THINGS SO WELL BUT THE QUIET PROSINGS OF THREE SUCH WOMEN MADE HER FEEL THAT EVERY EVENING SO SPENT
209-4731-0021 WAS INDEED ONE OF THE LONG EVENINGS SHE HAD FEARFULLY ANTICIPATED AS SHE SAT ONE MORNING LOOKING FORWARD TO EXACTLY SUCH A CLOSE OF THE PRESENT DAY A NOTE WAS BROUGHT FROM MISSUS GODDARD REQUESTING IN MOST RESPECTFUL TERMS
209-4731-0022 AND THE EVENING NO LONGER DREADED BY THE FAIR MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HARRIET SMITH WAS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY SOMEBODY HAD PLACED HER SEVERAL YEARS BACK AT MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL
209-4731-0023 AND SOMEBODY HAD LATELY RAISED HER FROM THE CONDITION OF SCHOLAR TO THAT OF PARLOUR BOARDER THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS GENERALLY KNOWN OF HER HISTORY SHE HAD NO VISIBLE FRIENDS BUT WHAT HAD BEEN ACQUIRED AT HIGHBURY
209-4731-0024 AND WAS NOW JUST RETURNED FROM A LONG VISIT IN THE COUNTRY TO SOME YOUNG LADIES WHO HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL THERE WITH HER SHE WAS A VERY PRETTY GIRL AND HER BEAUTY HAPPENED TO BE OF A SORT WHICH EMMA PARTICULARLY ADMIRED SHE WAS SHORT
209-4731-0025 PLUMP AND FAIR WITH A FINE BLOOM BLUE EYES LIGHT HAIR REGULAR FEATURES AND A LOOK OF GREAT SWEETNESS AND BEFORE THE END OF THE EVENING EMMA WAS AS MUCH PLEASED WITH HER MANNERS AS HER PERSON
209-4731-0026 AND QUITE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE WAS NOT STRUCK BY ANY THING REMARKABLY CLEVER IN MISS SMITH'S CONVERSATION BUT SHE FOUND HER ALTOGETHER VERY ENGAGING NOT INCONVENIENTLY SHY NOT UNWILLING TO TALK
209-4731-0027 AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD AND SO ARTLESSLY IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY THING IN SO SUPERIOR A STYLE TO WHAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO
209-4731-0028 THAT SHE MUST HAVE GOOD SENSE AND DESERVE ENCOURAGEMENT ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES AND ALL THOSE NATURAL GRACES SHOULD NOT BE WASTED ON THE INFERIOR SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY AND ITS CONNEXIONS
209-4731-0029 THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE HAD ALREADY FORMED WERE UNWORTHY OF HER THE FRIENDS FROM WHOM SHE HAD JUST PARTED THOUGH VERY GOOD SORT OF PEOPLE MUST BE DOING HER HARM THEY WERE A FAMILY OF THE NAME OF MARTIN
209-4731-0030 AS RENTING A LARGE FARM OF MISTER KNIGHTLEY AND RESIDING IN THE PARISH OF DONWELL VERY CREDITABLY SHE BELIEVED SHE KNEW MISTER KNIGHTLEY THOUGHT HIGHLY OF THEM BUT THEY MUST BE COARSE AND UNPOLISHED
209-4731-0031 SHE WOULD IMPROVE HER SHE WOULD DETACH HER FROM HER BAD ACQUAINTANCE AND INTRODUCE HER INTO GOOD SOCIETY SHE WOULD FORM HER OPINIONS AND HER MANNERS IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING AND CERTAINLY A VERY KIND UNDERTAKING
209-4731-0032 HIGHLY BECOMING HER OWN SITUATION IN LIFE HER LEISURE AND POWERS SHE WAS SO BUSY IN ADMIRING THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES IN TALKING AND LISTENING AND FORMING ALL THESE SCHEMES IN THE IN BETWEENS
209-4731-0033 THAT THE EVENING FLEW AWAY AT A VERY UNUSUAL RATE AND THE SUPPER TABLE WHICH ALWAYS CLOSED SUCH PARTIES AND FOR WHICH SHE HAD BEEN USED TO SIT AND WATCH THE DUE TIME WAS ALL SET OUT AND READY AND MOVED FORWARDS TO THE FIRE BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE
209-4731-0034 OF DOING EVERY THING WELL AND ATTENTIVELY WITH THE REAL GOOD WILL OF A MIND DELIGHTED WITH ITS OWN IDEAS DID SHE THEN DO ALL THE HONOURS OF THE MEAL AND HELP AND RECOMMEND THE MINCED CHICKEN AND SCALLOPED OYSTERS WITH AN URGENCY WHICH SHE KNEW WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE
209-4731-0035 TO THE EARLY HOURS AND CIVIL SCRUPLES OF THEIR GUESTS UPON SUCH OCCASIONS POOR MISTER WOODHOUSES FEELINGS WERE IN SAD WARFARE HE LOVED TO HAVE THE CLOTH LAID BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN THE FASHION OF HIS YOUTH
209-4731-0036 HIS CARE FOR THEIR HEALTH MADE HIM GRIEVE THAT THEY WOULD EAT SUCH ANOTHER SMALL BASIN OF THIN GRUEL AS HIS OWN WAS ALL THAT HE COULD WITH THOROUGH SELF APPROBATION RECOMMEND
209-4731-0037 THOUGH HE MIGHT CONSTRAIN HIMSELF WHILE THE LADIES WERE COMFORTABLY CLEARING THE NICER THINGS TO SAY MISSUS BATES LET ME PROPOSE YOUR VENTURING ON ONE OF THESE EGGS
209-4731-0038 SERLE UNDERSTANDS BOILING AN EGG BETTER THAN ANY BODY I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN EGG BOILED BY ANY BODY ELSE BUT YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID THEY ARE VERY SMALL YOU SEE ONE OF OUR SMALL EGGS WILL NOT HURT YOU
209-4731-0039 WHAT SAY YOU TO HALF A GLASS OF WINE A SMALL HALF GLASS PUT INTO A TUMBLER OF WATER I DO NOT THINK IT COULD DISAGREE WITH YOU EMMA ALLOWED HER FATHER TO TALK BUT SUPPLIED HER VISITORS IN A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY STYLE
209-4731-0040 AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY THE HAPPINESS OF MISS SMITH WAS QUITE EQUAL TO HER INTENTIONS MISS WOODHOUSE WAS SO GREAT A PERSONAGE IN HIGHBURY
209-4731-0041 THAT THE PROSPECT OF THE INTRODUCTION HAD GIVEN AS MUCH PANIC AS PLEASURE BUT THE HUMBLE GRATEFUL LITTLE GIRL WENT OFF WITH HIGHLY GRATIFIED FEELINGS
