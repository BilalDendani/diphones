4211-3835-0000 NEKHLUDOFF MEANT TO REARRANGE THE WHOLE OF HIS EXTERNAL LIFE TO LET HIS LARGE HOUSE AND MOVE TO AN HOTEL BUT AGRAPHENA PETROVNA POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS USELESS TO CHANGE ANYTHING BEFORE THE WINTER
4211-3835-0001 NO ONE WOULD RENT A TOWN HOUSE FOR THE SUMMER ANYHOW HE WOULD HAVE TO LIVE AND KEEP HIS THINGS SOMEWHERE AND SO ALL HIS EFFORTS TO CHANGE HIS MANNER OF LIFE HE MEANT TO LIVE MORE SIMPLY AS THE STUDENTS LIVE LED TO NOTHING
4211-3835-0002 NOT ONLY DID EVERYTHING REMAIN AS IT WAS BUT THE HOUSE WAS SUDDENLY FILLED WITH NEW ACTIVITY ALL THAT WAS MADE OF WOOL OR FUR WAS TAKEN OUT TO BE AIRED AND BEATEN THE GATE KEEPER THE BOY THE COOK AND CORNEY HIMSELF TOOK PART IN THIS ACTIVITY
4211-3835-0003 ALL SORTS OF STRANGE FURS WHICH NO ONE EVER USED AND VARIOUS UNIFORMS WERE TAKEN OUT AND HUNG ON A LINE THEN THE CARPETS AND FURNITURE WERE BROUGHT OUT AND THE GATE KEEPER AND THE BOY ROLLED THEIR SLEEVES UP THEIR MUSCULAR ARMS
4211-3835-0004 AND STOOD BEATING THESE THINGS KEEPING STRICT TIME WHILE THE ROOMS WERE FILLED WITH THE SMELL OF NAPHTHALINE WHEN NEKHLUDOFF CROSSED THE YARD OR LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAW ALL THIS GOING ON HE WAS SURPRISED AT THE GREAT NUMBER OF THINGS THERE WERE
4211-3835-0005 ALL QUITE USELESS THEIR ONLY USE NEKHLUDOFF THOUGHT WAS THE PROVIDING OF EXERCISE FOR AGRAPHENA PETROVNA CORNEY THE GATE KEEPER THE BOY AND THE COOK
4211-3835-0006 BUT IT'S NOT WORTH WHILE ALTERING MY MANNER OF LIFE NOW HE THOUGHT WHILE MASLOVA'S CASE IS NOT DECIDED BESIDES IT IS TOO DIFFICULT IT WILL ALTER OF ITSELF WHEN SHE WILL BE SET FREE OR EXILED AND I FOLLOW HER
4211-3835-0007 ON THE APPOINTED DAY NEKHLUDOFF DROVE UP TO THE ADVOCATE FANARIN'S OWN SPLENDID HOUSE WHICH WAS DECORATED WITH HUGE PALMS AND OTHER PLANTS AND WONDERFUL CURTAINS IN FACT
4211-3835-0008 MONEY ACQUIRED WITHOUT LABOUR WHICH ONLY THOSE POSSESS WHO GROW RICH SUDDENLY IN THE WAITING ROOM JUST AS IN A DOCTOR'S WAITING ROOM HE FOUND MANY DEJECTED LOOKING PEOPLE SITTING ROUND SEVERAL TABLES
4211-3835-0009 ON WHICH LAY ILLUSTRATED PAPERS MEANT TO AMUSE THEM AWAITING THEIR TURNS TO BE ADMITTED TO THE ADVOCATE THE ADVOCATE'S ASSISTANT SAT IN THE ROOM AT A HIGH DESK AND HAVING RECOGNISED NEKHLUDOFF HE CAME UP TO HIM
4211-3835-0010 AND SAID HE WOULD GO AND ANNOUNCE HIM AT ONCE BUT THE ASSISTANT HAD NOT REACHED THE DOOR BEFORE IT OPENED AND THE SOUNDS OF LOUD ANIMATED VOICES WERE HEARD THE VOICE OF A MIDDLE AGED STURDY MERCHANT WITH A RED FACE AND THICK MOUSTACHES
4211-3835-0011 AND THE VOICE OF FANARIN HIMSELF FANARIN WAS ALSO A MIDDLE AGED MAN OF MEDIUM HEIGHT WITH A WORN LOOK ON HIS FACE BOTH FACES BORE THE EXPRESSION WHICH YOU SEE ON THE FACES OF THOSE WHO HAVE JUST CONCLUDED A PROFITABLE BUT NOT QUITE HONEST TRANSACTION
4211-3835-0012 YOUR OWN FAULT YOU KNOW MY DEAR SIR FANARIN SAID SMILING WE'D ALL BE IN EAVEN WERE IT NOT FOR HOUR SINS OH YES YES WE ALL KNOW THAT AND BOTH LAUGHED UN NATURALLY
4211-3835-0013 SAID FANARIN SEEING HIM AND NODDING ONCE MORE TO THE MERCHANT HE LED NEKHLUDOFF INTO HIS BUSINESS CABINET FURNISHED IN A SEVERELY CORRECT STYLE WON'T YOU SMOKE
4211-3835-0014 SAID THE ADVOCATE SITTING DOWN OPPOSITE NEKHLUDOFF AND TRYING TO CONCEAL A SMILE APPARENTLY STILL EXCITED BY THE SUCCESS OF THE ACCOMPLISHED TRANSACTION THANKS I HAVE COME ABOUT MASLOVA'S CASE YES YES DIRECTLY
4211-3835-0015 HE SAID YOU SAW THIS HERE FELLOW WHY HE HAS ABOUT TWELVE MILLION ROUBLES AND HE CANNOT SPEAK CORRECTLY AND IF HE CAN GET A TWENTY FIVE ROUBLE NOTE OUT OF YOU HE'LL HAVE IT IF HE'S TO WRENCH IT OUT WITH HIS TEETH
4211-3835-0016 HE SAYS EAVEN AND HOUR AND YOU SAY THIS HERE FELLOW NEKHLUDOFF THOUGHT WITH AN INSURMOUNTABLE FEELING OF AVERSION TOWARDS THIS MAN WHO WISHED TO SHOW BY HIS FREE AND EASY MANNER
4211-3835-0017 THAT HE AND NEKHLUDOFF BELONGED TO ONE AND THE SAME CAMP WHILE HIS OTHER CLIENTS BELONGED TO ANOTHER HE HAS WORRIED ME TO DEATH A FEARFUL SCOUNDREL I FELT I MUST RELIEVE MY FEELINGS SAID THE ADVOCATE
4211-3835-0018 WELL HOW ABOUT YOUR CASE I HAVE READ IT ATTENTIVELY BUT DO NOT APPROVE OF IT I MEAN THAT GREENHORN OF AN ADVOCATE HAS LEFT NO VALID REASON FOR AN APPEAL WELL THEN WHAT HAVE YOU DECIDED
4211-3835-0019 ONE MOMENT TELL HIM HE SAID TO HIS ASSISTANT WHO HAD JUST COME IN THAT I KEEP TO WHAT I HAVE SAID IF HE CAN IT'S ALL RIGHT IF NOT NO MATTER BUT HE WON'T AGREE WELL NO MATTER AND THE ADVOCATE FROWNED
4211-3835-0020 AFTER A PAUSE I HAVE FREED ONE INSOLVENT DEBTOR FROM A TOTALLY FALSE CHARGE AND NOW THEY ALL FLOCK TO ME YET EVERY SUCH CASE COSTS ENORMOUS LABOUR WHY DON'T WE TOO LOSE BITS OF FLESH IN THE INKSTAND
4211-3835-0021 AS SOME WRITER OR OTHER HAS SAID WELL AS TO YOUR CASE OR RATHER THE CASE YOU ARE TAKING AN INTEREST IN IT HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ABOMINABLY THERE IS NO GOOD REASON FOR APPEALING
4211-3835-0022 STILL HE CONTINUED WE CAN BUT TRY TO GET THE SENTENCE REVOKED THIS IS WHAT I HAVE NOTED DOWN HE TOOK UP SEVERAL SHEETS OF PAPER COVERED WITH WRITING AND BEGAN TO READ RAPIDLY
4211-3835-0023 SLURRING OVER THE UNINTERESTING LEGAL TERMS AND LAYING PARTICULAR STRESS ON SOME SENTENCES
4211-3835-0024 ACCORDING TO THE DECISIONS ET CETERA THE VERDICT ET CETERA SO AND SO MASLOVA PRONOUNCED GUILTY OF HAVING CAUSED THE DEATH THROUGH POISON OF THE MERCHANT SMELKOFF AND HAS ACCORDING TO STATUTE FOURTEEN FIFTY FOUR OF THE PENAL CODE BEEN SENTENCED TO SIBERIA
4211-3835-0025 ET CETERA ET CETERA HE STOPPED EVIDENTLY IN SPITE OF HIS BEING SO USED TO IT HE STILL FELT PLEASURE IN LISTENING TO HIS OWN PRODUCTIONS THIS SENTENCE IS THE DIRECT RESULT OF THE MOST GLARING JUDICIAL PERVERSION AND ERROR
4211-3835-0026 HE CONTINUED IMPRESSIVELY AND THERE ARE GROUNDS FOR ITS REVOCATION FIRSTLY THE READING OF THE MEDICAL REPORT OF THE EXAMINATION OF SMELKOFF'S INTESTINES WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE PRESIDENT AT THE VERY BEGINNING THIS IS POINT ONE
4211-3835-0027 BUT IT WAS THE PROSECUTING SIDE THAT DEMANDED THIS READING NEKHLUDOFF SAID WITH SURPRISE THAT DOES NOT MATTER THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN REASONS FOR THE DEFENCE TO DEMAND THIS READING TOO OH
4211-3835-0028 IT IS A GROUND FOR APPEAL THOUGH TO CONTINUE SECONDLY HE WENT ON READING WHEN MASLOVA'S ADVOCATE IN HIS SPEECH FOR THE DEFENCE WISHING TO CHARACTERISE MASLOVA'S PERSONALITY
4211-3835-0029 REFERRED TO THE CAUSES OF HER FALL HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE PRESIDENT CALLING HIM TO ORDER FOR THE ALLEGED DEVIATION FROM THE DIRECT SUBJECT YET AS HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY POINTED OUT BY THE SENATE THE ELUCIDATION OF THE CRIMINAL'S CHARACTERISTICS
4211-3835-0030 AND HIS OR HER MORAL STANDPOINT IN GENERAL HAS A SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE IN CRIMINAL CASES EVEN IF ONLY AS A GUIDE IN THE SETTLING OF THE QUESTION OF IMPUTATION THAT'S POINT TWO HE SAID
4211-3835-0031 WITH A LOOK AT NEKHLUDOFF BUT HE SPOKE SO BADLY THAT NO ONE COULD MAKE ANYTHING OF IT NEKHLUDOFF SAID STILL MORE ASTONISHED THE FELLOW'S QUITE A FOOL AND OF COURSE COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO SAY ANYTHING SENSIBLE
4211-3835-0032 FANARIN SAID LAUGHING BUT ALL THE SAME IT WILL DO AS A REASON FOR APPEAL THIRDLY THE PRESIDENT IN HIS SUMMING UP
4211-3835-0033 OMITTED TO INFORM THE JURY WHAT THE JUDICIAL POINTS ARE THAT CONSTITUTE GUILT AND DID NOT MENTION THAT HAVING ADMITTED THE FACT OF MASLOVA HAVING ADMINISTERED THE POISON TO SMELKOFF THE JURY HAD A RIGHT NOT TO IMPUTE THE GUILT OF MURDER TO HER
4211-3835-0034 SINCE THE PROOFS OF WILFUL INTENT TO DEPRIVE SMELKOFF OF LIFE WERE ABSENT AND ONLY TO PRONOUNCE HER GUILTY OF CARELESSNESS RESULTING IN THE DEATH OF THE MERCHANT WHICH SHE DID NOT DESIRE THIS IS THE CHIEF POINT
4211-3835-0035 YES BUT WE OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT OURSELVES IT WAS OUR MISTAKE AND NOW THE FOURTH POINT THE ADVOCATE CONTINUED THE FORM OF THE ANSWER GIVEN BY THE JURY CONTAINED AN EVIDENT CONTRADICTION
4211-3835-0036 MASLOVA IS ACCUSED OF WILFULLY POISONING SMELKOFF HER ONE OBJECT BEING THAT OF CUPIDITY THE ONLY MOTIVE TO COMMIT MURDER SHE COULD HAVE HAD THE JURY IN THEIR VERDICT ACQUIT HER OF THE INTENT TO ROB
4211-3835-0037 OR PARTICIPATION IN THE STEALING OF VALUABLES FROM WHICH IT FOLLOWS THAT THEY INTENDED ALSO TO ACQUIT HER OF THE INTENT TO MURDER AND ONLY THROUGH A MISUNDERSTANDING WHICH AROSE FROM THE INCOMPLETENESS OF THE PRESIDENT'S SUMMING UP
4211-3835-0038 OMITTED TO EXPRESS IT IN DUE FORM IN THEIR ANSWER THEREFORE AN ANSWER OF THIS KIND BY THE JURY ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED THE APPLICATION OF STATUTES
4211-3835-0039 AND ANOTHER DEBATE ON THE QUESTION OF THE PRISONER'S GUILT THEN WHY DID THE PRESIDENT NOT DO IT I TOO SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY FANARIN SAID LAUGHING THEN THE SENATE WILL OF COURSE CORRECT THIS ERROR
4211-3835-0040 THAT WILL ALL DEPEND ON WHO WILL PRESIDE THERE AT THE TIME WELL NOW THERE IT IS I HAVE FURTHER SAID HE CONTINUED RAPIDLY A VERDICT OF THIS KIND GAVE THE COURT NO RIGHT TO CONDEMN MASLOVA TO BE PUNISHED AS A CRIMINAL
4211-3835-0041 OF COURSE IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT MEMBERS WILL BE PRESENT AT THE SENATE IF YOU HAVE ANY INFLUENCE THERE YOU CAN BUT TRY I DO KNOW SOME ALL RIGHT ONLY BE QUICK ABOUT IT ELSE THEY'LL ALL GO OFF FOR A CHANGE OF AIR
4211-3835-0042 THEN YOU MAY HAVE TO WAIT THREE MONTHS BEFORE THEY RETURN THEN IN CASE OF FAILURE
4211-3835-0043 THIS TOO DEPENDS ON THE PRIVATE INFLUENCE YOU CAN BRING TO WORK IN THIS CASE TOO I AM AT YOUR SERVICE I MEAN AS TO THE WORKING OF THE PETITION NOT THE INFLUENCE THANK YOU
4211-3835-0044 NOW AS TO YOUR FEES MY ASSISTANT WILL HAND YOU THE PETITION AND TELL YOU ONE THING MORE THE PROCUREUR GAVE ME A PASS FOR VISITING THIS PERSON IN PRISON
4211-3835-0045 BUT THEY TELL ME I MUST ALSO GET A PERMISSION FROM THE GOVERNOR IN ORDER TO GET AN INTERVIEW AT ANOTHER TIME AND IN ANOTHER PLACE THAN THOSE APPOINTED IS THIS NECESSARY YES I THINK SO BUT THE GOVERNOR IS AWAY AT PRESENT
4211-3835-0046 A VICE GOVERNOR IS IN HIS PLACE AND HE IS SUCH AN IMPENETRABLE FOOL THAT YOU'LL SCARCELY BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING WITH HIM IS IT MESLENNIKOFF YES I KNOW HIM SAID NEKHLUDOFF AND GOT UP TO GO
4211-3835-0047 AT THIS MOMENT A HORRIBLY UGLY LITTLE BONY SNUB NOSED YELLOW FACED WOMAN FLEW INTO THE ROOM IT WAS THE ADVOCATE'S WIFE WHO DID NOT SEEM TO BE IN THE LEAST BIT TROUBLED BY HER UGLINESS
4211-3835-0048 SHE WAS ATTIRED IN THE MOST ORIGINAL MANNER SHE SEEMED ENVELOPED IN SOMETHING MADE OF VELVET AND SILK SOMETHING YELLOW AND GREEN AND HER THIN HAIR WAS CRIMPED SHE STEPPED OUT TRIUMPHANTLY INTO THE ANTE ROOM
4211-3835-0049 FOLLOWED BY A TALL SMILING MAN WITH A GREENISH COMPLEXION DRESSED IN A COAT WITH SILK FACINGS AND A WHITE TIE THIS WAS AN AUTHOR NEKHLUDOFF KNEW HIM BY SIGHT SHE OPENED THE CABINET DOOR AND SAID
4211-3835-0050 WHO WILL READ HIS POEMS AND YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY COME AND READ ABOUT GARSHIN NEKHLUDOFF NOTICED THAT SHE WHISPERED SOMETHING TO HER HUSBAND AND THINKING IT WAS SOMETHING CONCERNING HIM WISHED TO GO AWAY
4211-3835-0051 BUT SHE CAUGHT HIM UP AND SAID I BEG YOUR PARDON PRINCE I KNOW YOU AND THINKING AN INTRODUCTION SUPERFLUOUS I BEG YOU TO STAY AND TAKE PART IN OUR LITERARY MATINEE IT WILL BE MOST INTERESTING M FANARIN WILL READ
4211-3835-0052 SAID FANARIN SPREADING OUT HIS HANDS AND SMILINGLY POINTING TO HIS WIFE AS IF TO SHOW HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS TO RESIST SO CHARMING A CREATURE NEKHLUDOFF THANKED THE ADVOCATE'S WIFE WITH EXTREME POLITENESS FOR THE HONOUR SHE DID HIM IN INVITING HIM
4211-3835-0053 BUT REFUSED THE INVITATION WITH A SAD AND SOLEMN LOOK AND LEFT THE ROOM WHAT AN AFFECTED FELLOW
4211-3835-0054 IN THE ANTE ROOM THE ASSISTANT HANDED HIM A READY WRITTEN PETITION AND SAID THAT THE FEES INCLUDING THE BUSINESS WITH THE SENATE AND THE COMMISSION WOULD COME TO ONE THOUSAND ROUBLES
4211-3835-0055 AND EXPLAINED THAT M FANARIN DID NOT USUALLY UNDERTAKE THIS KIND OF BUSINESS BUT DID IT ONLY TO OBLIGE NEKHLUDOFF AND ABOUT THIS PETITION WHO IS TO SIGN IT THE PRISONER MAY DO IT HERSELF
4211-3835-0056 OR IF THIS IS INCONVENIENT M FANARIN CAN IF HE GETS A POWER OF ATTORNEY FROM HER OH NO I SHALL TAKE THE PETITION TO HER AND GET HER TO SIGN IT SAID NEKHLUDOFF
