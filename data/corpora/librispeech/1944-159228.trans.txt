1944-159228-0000 I NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE JOE AGAIN BUT SIX MONTHS LATER WE DID MEET IN A WASHINGTON HOSPITAL ONE WINTER'S NIGHT A TRAIN OF AMBULANCES HAD LEFT THEIR SAD FREIGHT AT OUR DOOR
1944-159228-0001 AND WE WERE HURRYING TO GET THE POOR FELLOWS INTO MUCH NEEDED BEDS AFTER A WEEK OF HUNGER COLD AND UNAVOIDABLE NEGLECT ALL FORMS OF PAIN WERE IN MY WARD THAT NIGHT
1944-159228-0002 AND ALL BORNE WITH THE PATHETIC PATIENCE WHICH WAS A DAILY MARVEL TO THOSE WHO SAW IT TRYING TO BRING ORDER OUT OF CHAOS I WAS RUSHING UP AND DOWN THE NARROW AISLE BETWEEN THE ROWS OF RAPIDLY FILLING BEDS
1944-159228-0003 AND AFTER BRUSHING SEVERAL TIMES AGAINST A PAIR OF THE LARGEST AND MUDDIEST BOOTS I EVER SAW I PAUSED AT LAST TO INQUIRE WHY THEY WERE IMPEDING THE PASSAGEWAY I FOUND THEY BELONGED TO A VERY TALL MAN
1944-159228-0004 WHO SEEMED TO BE ALREADY ASLEEP OR DEAD SO WHITE AND STILL AND UTTERLY WORN OUT HE LOOKED AS HE LAY THERE WITHOUT A COAT A GREAT PATCH ON HIS FOREHEAD
1944-159228-0005 AND THE RIGHT ARM RUDELY BUNDLED UP STOOPING TO COVER HIM I SAW THAT HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS AND WHIPPING OUT MY BRANDY BOTTLE AND SALTS SOON BROUGHT HIM ROUND FOR IT WAS ONLY EXHAUSTION
1944-159228-0006 CAN YOU EAT I ASKED AS HE SAID THANKY MA'AM AFTER A LONG DRAUGHT OF WATER AND A DIZZY STARE EAT I'M STARVIN HE ANSWERED
1944-159228-0007 WITH SUCH A RAVENOUS GLANCE AT A FAT NURSE WHO HAPPENED TO BE PASSING THAT I TREMBLED FOR HER AND HASTENED TO TAKE A BOWL OF SOUP FROM HER TRAY AS I FED HIM HIS GAUNT WEATHER BEATEN FACE HAD A FAMILIAR LOOK
1944-159228-0008 AND THERE WAS THE NAME JOSEPH COLLINS TO GIVE ME AN ADDITIONAL INTEREST IN MY NEW PATIENT WHY JOE IS IT REALLY YOU
1944-159228-0009 I EXCLAIMED POURING THE LAST SPOONFUL OF SOUP DOWN HIS THROAT SO HASTILY THAT I CHOKED HIM ALL THAT'S LEFT OF ME
1944-159228-0010 AIN'T THIS LUCK NOW GASPED JOE AS GRATEFULLY AS IF THAT HOSPITAL COT WAS A BED OF ROSES WHAT IS THE MATTER A WOUND IN THE HEAD AND ARM I ASKED
1944-159228-0011 IT'S A SING'LAR KIND OF A FEELIN TO SEE A PIECE OF YOUR OWN BODY GO FLYIN AWAY WITH NO PROSPECT OF EVER COMING BACK AGAIN SAID JOE
1944-159228-0012 TRYING TO MAKE LIGHT OF ONE OF THE GREATEST MISFORTUNES A MAN CAN SUFFER THAT IS BAD BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORSE
1944-159228-0013 I GUESS IT WON'T DO MUCH LUMBERIN SO THAT TRADE IS DONE FOR I S'POSE THERE'S THINGS LEFT HANDED FELLERS CAN DO AND I MUST LEARN EM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
1944-159228-0014 WHAT CAN I DO TO COMFORT YOU MOST JOE I'LL SEND MY GOOD BEN TO HELP YOU TO BED AND WILL BE HERE MYSELF WHEN THE SURGEON GOES HIS ROUNDS IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT WOULD MAKE YOU MORE EASY
1944-159228-0015 IF YOU COULD JUST DROP A LINE TO MOTHER TO LET HER KNOW I'M ALIVE IT WOULD BE A SIGHT OF COMFORT TO BOTH OF US I GUESS I'M IN FOR A LONG SPELL OF HOSPITAL
1944-159228-0016 AND I'D LAY EASIER IF I KNEW MOTHER AND LUCINDY WARN'T FRETTIN ABOUT ME HE MUST HAVE BEEN SUFFERING TERRIBLY BUT HE THOUGHT OF THE WOMEN WHO LOVED HIM BEFORE HIMSELF AND BUSY AS I WAS
1944-159228-0017 I SNATCHED A MOMENT TO SEND A FEW WORDS OF HOPE TO THE OLD MOTHER THEN I LEFT HIM LAYIN EASY THOUGH THE PROSPECT OF SOME MONTHS OF WEARING PAIN WOULD HAVE DAUNTED MOST MEN
1944-159228-0018 IF I HAD NEEDED ANYTHING TO INCREASE MY REGARD FOR JOE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE COURAGE WITH WHICH HE BORE A VERY BAD QUARTER OF AN HOUR WITH THE SURGEONS FOR HIS ARM WAS IN A DANGEROUS STATE
1944-159228-0019 THE WOUND IN THE HEAD FEVERISH FOR WANT OF CARE AND A HEAVY COLD ON THE LUNGS SUGGESTED PNEUMONIA AS AN ADDED TRIAL TO HIS LIST OF ILLS HE WILL HAVE A HARD TIME OF IT
1944-159228-0020 BUT I THINK HE WILL PULL THROUGH AS HE IS A TEMPERATE FELLOW WITH A SPLENDID CONSTITUTION WAS THE DOCTOR'S VERDICT AS HE LEFT US FOR THE NEXT MAN WHO WAS PAST HELP WITH A BULLET THROUGH HIS LUNGS
1944-159228-0021 THINK SO
1944-159228-0022 SHE AIN'T NO FOLKS OF HER OWN NOR MUCH MEANS AND OUGHT TO MARRY A MAN WHO CAN MAKE THINGS EASY FOR HER GUESS I'LL HAVE TO WAIT A SPELL LONGER BEFORE I SAY ANYTHING TO LUCINDY ABOUT MARRYIN NOW
1944-159228-0023 AND YOU WILL FIND THE BURDENS MUCH LIGHTER FOR SHARING THEM BETWEEN YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT BUT GET WELL AND GO HOME AS SOON AS YOU CAN ALL RIGHT MA'AM
1944-159228-0024 AND JOE PROVED HIMSELF A GOOD SOLDIER BY OBEYING ORDERS AND FALLING ASLEEP LIKE A TIRED CHILD AS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD RECOVERY FOR TWO MONTHS I SAW JOE DAILY
1944-159228-0025 AND LEARNED TO LIKE HIM VERY MUCH HE WAS SO HONEST GENUINE AND KIND HEARTED SO DID HIS MATES FOR HE MADE FRIENDS WITH THEM ALL BY SHARING SUCH SMALL LUXURIES AS CAME TO HIM
1944-159228-0026 FOR HE WAS A FAVORITE AND BETTER STILL HE MADE SUNSHINE IN THAT SAD PLACE BY THE BRAVE PATIENCE WITH WHICH HE BORE HIS OWN TROUBLES THE CHEERFUL CONSOLATION HE ALWAYS GAVE TO OTHERS
1944-159228-0027 A DROLL FELLOW WAS JOE AT TIMES FOR UNDER HIS SOBRIETY LAY MUCH HUMOR AND I SOON DISCOVERED THAT A VISIT FROM HIM WAS MORE EFFICACIOUS
1944-159228-0028 THAN OTHER CORDIALS IN CASES OF DESPONDENCY AND DISCONTENT ROARS OF LAUGHTER SOMETIMES GREETED ME AS I WENT INTO HIS WARD AND JOE'S JOKES WERE PASSED ROUND AS EAGERLY AS THE WATER PITCHER
1944-159228-0029 YET HE HAD MUCH TO TRY HIM NOT ONLY IN THE ILLS THAT VEXED HIS FLESH BUT THE CARES THAT TRIED HIS SPIRIT AND THE FUTURE THAT LAY BEFORE HIM FULL OF ANXIETIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
1944-159228-0030 WHICH SEEMED SO HEAVY NOW WHEN THE STRONG RIGHT ARM THAT HAD CLEARED ALL OBSTACLES AWAY BEFORE WAS GONE THE LETTERS I WROTE FOR HIM AND THOSE HE RECEIVED TOLD THE LITTLE STORY VERY PLAINLY
1944-159228-0031 FOR HE READ THEM TO ME AND FOUND MUCH COMFORT IN TALKING OVER HIS AFFAIRS AS MOST MEN DO WHEN ILLNESS MAKES THEM DEPENDENT ON A WOMAN JIM WAS EVIDENTLY SICK AND SELFISH
1944-159228-0032 LUCINDY TO JUDGE FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH CHERISHED SO TENDERLY UNDER JOE'S PILLOW WAS A PRETTY WEAK SORT OF A GIRL WITH LITTLE CHARACTER OR COURAGE TO HELP POOR JOE WITH HIS BURDENS
1944-159228-0033 THE OLD MOTHER WAS VERY LIKE HER SON AND STOOD BY HIM LIKE A HERO AS HE SAID BUT WAS EVIDENTLY FAILING AND BEGGED HIM TO COME HOME AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE
1944-159228-0034 THAT SHE MIGHT SEE HIM COMFORTABLY SETTLED BEFORE SHE MUST LEAVE HIM HER COURAGE SUSTAINED HIS AND THE LONGING TO SEE HER HASTENED HIS DEPARTURE AS SOON AS IT WAS SAFE TO LET HIM GO
1944-159228-0035 FOR LUCINDY'S LETTERS WERE ALWAYS OF A DISMAL SORT AND MADE HIM ANXIOUS TO PUT HIS SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL SHE ALWAYS SET CONSIDER'BLE BY ME MOTHER DID BEIN THE OLDEST
1944-159228-0036 AND I WOULDN'T MISS MAKIN HER LAST DAYS HAPPY NOT IF IT COST ME ALL THE ARMS AND LEGS I'VE GOT SAID JOE AS HE AWKWARDLY STRUGGLED INTO THE BIG BOOTS AN HOUR AFTER LEAVE TO GO HOME WAS GIVEN HIM
1944-159228-0037 IT WAS PLEASANT TO SEE HIS COMRADES GATHER ROUND HIM WITH SUCH HEARTY ADIEUS THAT HIS ONE HAND MUST HAVE TINGLED
1944-159228-0038 AND TO FIND TEARS IN MANY EYES BESIDE MY OWN WHEN HE WAS GONE AND NOTHING WAS LEFT OF HIM BUT THE EMPTY COT THE OLD GRAY WRAPPER AND THE NAME UPON THE WALL
1944-159228-0039 I KEPT THAT CARD AMONG MY OTHER RELICS AND HOPED TO MEET JOE AGAIN SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD HE SENT ME ONE OR TWO LETTERS THEN I WENT HOME THE WAR ENDED SOON AFTER
