2152-133043-0000 IT WAS THE DAY AFTER MISTER CASAUBON HAD BEEN BURIED AND DOROTHEA WAS NOT YET ABLE TO LEAVE HER ROOM THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT YOU KNOW CHETTAM AS SHE IS AN EXECUTRIX AND SHE LIKES TO GO INTO THESE THINGS PROPERTY LAND THAT KIND OF THING
2152-133043-0001 AS AN EXECUTRIX DOROTHEA WOULD WANT TO ACT AND SHE WAS TWENTY ONE LAST DECEMBER YOU KNOW I CAN HINDER NOTHING SIR JAMES LOOKED AT THE CARPET FOR A MINUTE IN SILENCE AND THEN LIFTING HIS EYES SUDDENLY
2152-133043-0002 ALL BUSINESS MUST BE KEPT FROM HER AND AS SOON AS SHE IS ABLE TO BE MOVED SHE MUST COME TO US BEING WITH CELIA AND THE BABY WILL BE THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD FOR HER
2152-133043-0003 AND MEANWHILE YOU MUST GET RID OF LADISLAW YOU MUST SEND HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY HERE SIR JAMES'S LOOK OF DISGUST RETURNED IN ALL ITS INTENSITY MISTER BROOKE PUT HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM
2152-133043-0004 WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND STRAIGHTENED HIS BACK WITH A LITTLE SHAKE BEFORE HE REPLIED THAT IS EASILY SAID CHETTAM EASILY SAID YOU KNOW MY DEAR SIR PERSISTED SIR JAMES RESTRAINING HIS INDIGNATION WITHIN RESPECTFUL FORMS
2152-133043-0005 IT WAS YOU WHO BROUGHT HIM HERE
2152-133043-0006 I MEAN BY THE OCCUPATION YOU GIVE HIM YES BUT I CAN'T DISMISS HIM IN AN INSTANT WITHOUT ASSIGNING REASONS MY DEAR CHETTAM
2152-133043-0007 LADISLAW HAS BEEN INVALUABLE MOST SATISFACTORY I CONSIDER THAT I HAVE DONE THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY A SERVICE BY BRINGING HIM BY BRINGING HIM YOU KNOW MISTER BROOKE ENDED WITH A NOD TURNING ROUND TO GIVE IT
2152-133043-0008 IT'S A PITY THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY DIDN'T DO WITHOUT HIM
2152-133043-0009 YOU ADMIT I HOPE THAT I HAVE A RIGHT TO SPEAK ABOUT WHAT CONCERNS THE DIGNITY OF MY WIFE'S SISTER SIR JAMES WAS GETTING WARM OF COURSE MY DEAR CHETTAM OF COURSE BUT YOU AND I HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS DIFFERENT
2152-133043-0010 NOT ABOUT THIS ACTION OF CASAUBON'S I SHOULD HOPE INTERRUPTED SIR JAMES I SAY THAT HE HAS MOST UNFAIRLY COMPROMISED DOROTHEA I SAY THAT THERE NEVER WAS A MEANER MORE UNGENTLEMANLY ACTION THAN THIS
2152-133043-0011 WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND RELIANCE OF HER FAMILY A POSITIVE INSULT TO DOROTHEA WELL YOU KNOW CASAUBON WAS A LITTLE TWISTED ABOUT LADISLAW LADISLAW HAS TOLD ME THE REASON DISLIKE OF THE BENT HE TOOK YOU KNOW
2152-133043-0012 LADISLAW DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF CASAUBON'S NOTIONS THOTH AND DAGON THAT SORT OF THING AND I FANCY THAT CASAUBON DIDN'T LIKE THE INDEPENDENT POSITION LADISLAW HAD TAKEN UP I SAW THE LETTERS BETWEEN THEM YOU KNOW
2152-133043-0013 SAID SIR JAMES BUT I BELIEVE CASAUBON WAS ONLY JEALOUS OF HIM ON DOROTHEA'S ACCOUNT AND THE WORLD WILL SUPPOSE THAT SHE GAVE HIM SOME REASON AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT SO ABOMINABLE COUPLING HER NAME WITH THIS YOUNG FELLOW'S
2152-133043-0014 SEATING HIMSELF AND STICKING ON HIS EYE GLASS AGAIN IT'S ALL OF A PIECE WITH CASAUBON'S ODDITY THIS PAPER NOW
2152-133043-0015 WELL NO NOT THE URGENCY OF THE THING BY AND BY PERHAPS IT MAY COME ROUND AS TO GOSSIP YOU KNOW SENDING HIM AWAY WON'T HINDER GOSSIP PEOPLE SAY WHAT THEY LIKE TO SAY NOT WHAT THEY HAVE CHAPTER AND VERSE FOR
2152-133043-0016 SAID MISTER BROOKE BECOMING ACUTE ABOUT THE TRUTHS THAT LAY ON THE SIDE OF HIS OWN WISHES I MIGHT GET RID OF LADISLAW UP TO A CERTAIN POINT TAKE AWAY THE PIONEER FROM HIM AND THAT SORT OF THING BUT I COULDN'T SEND HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY
2152-133043-0017 IF HE DIDN'T CHOOSE TO GO DIDN'T CHOOSE YOU KNOW MISTER BROOKE PERSISTING AS QUIETLY AS IF HE WERE ONLY DISCUSSING THE NATURE OF LAST YEAR'S WEATHER AND NODDING AT THE END WITH HIS USUAL AMENITY
2152-133043-0018 WAS AN EXASPERATING FORM OF OBSTINACY GOOD GOD SAID SIR JAMES WITH AS MUCH PASSION AS HE EVER SHOWED LET US GET HIM A POST LET US SPEND MONEY ON HIM IF HE COULD GO IN THE SUITE OF SOME COLONIAL GOVERNOR
2152-133043-0019 GRAMPUS MIGHT TAKE HIM AND I COULD WRITE TO FULKE ABOUT IT BUT LADISLAW WON'T BE SHIPPED OFF LIKE A HEAD OF CATTLE MY DEAR FELLOW LADISLAW HAS HIS IDEAS
2152-133043-0020 IT'S MY OPINION THAT IF HE WERE TO PART FROM ME TO MORROW YOU'D ONLY HEAR THE MORE OF HIM IN THE COUNTRY WITH HIS TALENT FOR SPEAKING AND DRAWING UP DOCUMENTS THERE ARE FEW MEN WHO COULD COME UP TO HIM AS AN AGITATOR
2152-133043-0021 AN AGITATOR YOU KNOW AGITATOR SAID SIR JAMES WITH BITTER EMPHASIS FEELING THAT THE SYLLABLES OF THIS WORD
2152-133043-0022 OF ITS HATEFULNESS BUT BE REASONABLE CHETTAM DOROTHEA NOW AS YOU SAY SHE HAD BETTER GO TO CELIA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SHE CAN STAY UNDER YOUR ROOF AND IN THE MEAN TIME THINGS MAY COME ROUND QUIETLY
2152-133043-0023 THEN I AM TO CONCLUDE THAT YOU DECLINE TO DO ANYTHING
2152-133043-0024 NO I DIDN'T SAY DECLINE
2152-133043-0025 LADISLAW IS A GENTLEMAN
2152-133043-0026 SAID SIR JAMES HIS IRRITATION MAKING HIM FORGET HIMSELF A LITTLE I AM SURE CASAUBON WAS NOT
2152-133043-0027 I DON'T KNOW THAT SAID SIR JAMES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS INDELICATE ONE OF POOR CASAUBON'S FREAKS THAT ATTACK UPSET HIS BRAIN A LITTLE
2152-133043-0028 IT ALL GOES FOR NOTHING SHE DOESN'T WANT TO MARRY LADISLAW BUT THIS CODICIL IS FRAMED SO AS TO MAKE EVERYBODY BELIEVE THAT SHE DID
2152-133043-0029 THEN FROWNINGLY BUT I SUSPECT LADISLAW I TELL YOU FRANKLY I SUSPECT LADISLAW I COULDN'T TAKE ANY IMMEDIATE ACTION ON THAT GROUND CHETTAM
2152-133043-0030 IT WOULD LOOK ALL THE WORSE FOR DOROTHEA TO THOSE WHO KNEW ABOUT IT IT WOULD SEEM AS IF WE DISTRUSTED HER DISTRUSTED HER YOU KNOW THAT MISTER BROOKE HAD HIT ON AN UNDENIABLE ARGUMENT DID NOT TEND TO SOOTHE SIR JAMES
2152-133043-0031 HE PUT OUT HIS HAND TO REACH HIS HAT IMPLYING THAT HE DID NOT MEAN TO CONTEND FURTHER AND SAID STILL WITH SOME HEAT
2152-133043-0032 BECAUSE HER FRIENDS WERE TOO CARELESS I SHALL DO WHAT I CAN AS HER BROTHER TO PROTECT HER NOW YOU CAN'T DO BETTER THAN GET HER TO FRESHITT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE CHETTAM I APPROVE THAT PLAN ALTOGETHER SAID MISTER BROOKE WELL PLEASED
2152-133043-0033 THAT HE HAD WON THE ARGUMENT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHLY INCONVENIENT TO HIM TO PART WITH LADISLAW AT THAT TIME WHEN A DISSOLUTION MIGHT HAPPEN ANY DAY
