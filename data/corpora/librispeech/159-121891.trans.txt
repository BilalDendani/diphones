159-121891-0000 YET IN SOME WISE NOTWITHSTANDING YE DISCERN THE TRUE END OF HAPPINESS AND SO THE AIM OF NATURE LEADS YOU THITHER TO THAT TRUE GOOD WHILE ERROR IN MANY FORMS LEADS YOU ASTRAY THEREFROM
159-121891-0001 FOR REFLECT WHETHER MEN ARE ABLE TO WIN HAPPINESS BY THOSE MEANS THROUGH WHICH THEY THINK TO REACH THE PROPOSED END TRULY IF EITHER WEALTH RANK OR ANY OF THE REST
159-121891-0002 BRING WITH THEM ANYTHING OF SUCH SORT AS SEEMS TO HAVE NOTHING WANTING TO IT THAT IS GOOD WE TOO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME ARE MADE HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF THESE THINGS BUT IF THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO FULFIL THEIR PROMISES AND MOREOVER
159-121891-0003 LACK MANY GOOD THINGS IS NOT THE HAPPINESS MEN SEEK IN THEM CLEARLY DISCOVERED TO BE A FALSE SHOW THEREFORE DO I FIRST ASK THEE THYSELF WHO BUT LATELY WERT LIVING IN AFFLUENCE AMID ALL THAT ABUNDANCE OF WEALTH
159-121891-0004 WAS THY MIND NEVER TROUBLED IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME WRONG DONE TO THEE NAY SAID I
159-121891-0005 THE ABSENCE OF THE OTHER ADMITTED BUT A MAN LACKS THAT OF WHICH HE IS IN WANT HE DOES
159-121891-0006 CANNOT MAKE ITS POSSESSOR INDEPENDENT AND FREE FROM ALL WANT YET THIS WAS WHAT IT SEEMED TO PROMISE MOREOVER I THINK THIS ALSO WELL DESERVES TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN THE SPECIAL NATURE OF MONEY
159-121891-0007 TO HINDER ITS BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THOSE WHO POSSESS IT AGAINST THEIR WILL I ADMIT IT WHY OF COURSE WHEN EVERY DAY THE STRONGER WRESTS IT FROM THE WEAKER WITHOUT HIS CONSENT ELSE WHENCE COME LAWSUITS
159-121891-0008 WHO CAN VENTURE TO DENY IT YET HE WOULD NOT UNLESS HE POSSESSED THE MONEY WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE NO HE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT
159-121891-0009 THEN WE HAVE WORKED ROUND TO AN OPPOSITE CONCLUSION THE WEALTH WHICH WAS THOUGHT TO MAKE A MAN INDEPENDENT RATHER PUTS HIM IN NEED OF FURTHER PROTECTION HOW IN THE WORLD THEN
159-121891-0010 CAN WANT BE DRIVEN AWAY BY RICHES CANNOT THE RICH FEEL HUNGER CANNOT THEY THIRST ARE NOT THE LIMBS OF THE WEALTHY SENSITIVE TO THE WINTER'S COLD BUT THOU WILT SAY
159-121891-0011 THE RICH HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO SATE THEIR HUNGER THE MEANS TO GET RID OF THIRST AND COLD TRUE ENOUGH WANT CAN THUS BE SOOTHED BY RICHES WHOLLY REMOVED IT CANNOT BE
159-121891-0012 FOR IF THIS EVER GAPING EVER CRAVING WANT IS GLUTTED BY WEALTH IT NEEDS MUST BE THAT THE WANT ITSELF WHICH CAN BE SO GLUTTED STILL REMAINS I DO NOT SPEAK OF HOW VERY LITTLE SUFFICES FOR NATURE
159-121891-0013 AND HOW FOR AVARICE NOTHING IS ENOUGH WHEREFORE IF WEALTH CANNOT GET RID OF WANT AND MAKES NEW WANTS OF ITS OWN
159-121891-0014 SEE HIS PILES OF GOLD RISE HIGH THOUGH HE GATHER STORE OF TREASURE THAT CAN NEVER SATISFY THOUGH WITH PEARLS HIS GORGET BLAZES RAREST THAT THE OCEAN YIELDS THOUGH A HUNDRED HEAD OF OXEN TRAVAIL IN HIS AMPLE FIELDS
