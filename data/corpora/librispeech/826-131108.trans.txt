826-131108-0000 THE RIVER GOD ACHELOUS TOLD THE STORY OF ERISICHTHON TO THESEUS AND HIS COMPANIONS WHOM HE WAS ENTERTAINING AT HIS HOSPITABLE BOARD WHILE THEY WERE DELAYED ON THEIR JOURNEY BY THE OVERFLOW OF HIS WATERS HAVING FINISHED HIS STORY HE ADDED
826-131108-0001 BUT WHY SHOULD I TELL OF OTHER PERSONS TRANSFORMATIONS WHEN I MYSELF AM AN INSTANCE OF THE POSSESSION OF THIS POWER SOMETIMES I BECOME A SERPENT AND SOMETIMES A BULL WITH HORNS ON MY HEAD
826-131108-0002 I ONCE COULD DO SO BUT NOW I HAVE BUT ONE HORN HAVING LOST ONE AND HERE HE GROANED AND WAS SILENT THESEUS ASKED HIM THE CAUSE OF HIS GRIEF AND HOW HE LOST HIS HORN TO WHICH QUESTION THE RIVER GOD REPLIED AS FOLLOWS
826-131108-0003 WHO LIKES TO TELL OF HIS DEFEATS YET I WILL NOT HESITATE TO RELATE MINE COMFORTING MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT OF THE GREATNESS OF MY CONQUEROR
826-131108-0004 PERHAPS YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE FAME OF DEJANIRA THE FAIREST OF MAIDENS WHOM A HOST OF SUITORS STROVE TO WIN HERCULES AND MYSELF WERE OF THE NUMBER AND THE REST YIELDED TO US TWO
826-131108-0005 HIS STEPMOTHER I ON THE OTHER HAND SAID TO THE FATHER OF THE MAIDEN BEHOLD ME THE KING OF THE WATERS THAT FLOW THROUGH YOUR LAND I AM NO STRANGER FROM A FOREIGN SHORE BUT BELONG TO THE COUNTRY A PART OF YOUR REALM
826-131108-0006 AS I SAID THIS HERCULES SCOWLED UPON ME AND WITH DIFFICULTY RESTRAINED HIS RAGE MY HAND WILL ANSWER BETTER THAN MY TONGUE SAID HE I YIELD TO YOU THE VICTORY IN WORDS BUT TRUST MY CAUSE TO THE STRIFE OF DEEDS
826-131108-0007 WITH THAT HE ADVANCED TOWARDS ME AND I WAS ASHAMED AFTER WHAT I HAD SAID TO YIELD I THREW OFF MY GREEN VESTURE AND PRESENTED MYSELF FOR THE STRUGGLE HE TRIED TO THROW ME NOW ATTACKING MY HEAD NOW MY BODY MY BULK WAS MY PROTECTION AND HE ASSAILED ME IN VAIN
826-131108-0008 FOR A TIME WE STOPPED THEN RETURNED TO THE CONFLICT WE EACH KEPT OUR POSITION DETERMINED NOT TO YIELD FOOT TO FOOT I BENDING OVER HIM CLENCHING HIS HAND IN MINE WITH MY FOREHEAD ALMOST TOUCHING HIS THRICE HERCULES TRIED TO THROW ME OFF AND THE FOURTH TIME HE SUCCEEDED
826-131108-0009 I STRUGGLED TO GET MY ARMS AT LIBERTY PANTING AND REEKING WITH PERSPIRATION
826-131108-0010 MY KNEES WERE ON THE EARTH AND MY MOUTH IN THE DUST FINDING THAT I WAS NO MATCH FOR HIM IN THE WARRIOR'S ART I RESORTED TO OTHERS AND GLIDED AWAY IN THE FORM OF A SERPENT I CURLED MY BODY IN A COIL AND HISSED AT HIM WITH MY FORKED TONGUE HE SMILED SCORNFULLY AT THIS AND SAID
826-131108-0011 IT WAS THE LABOR OF MY INFANCY TO CONQUER SNAKES SO SAYING HE CLASPED MY NECK WITH HIS HANDS I WAS ALMOST CHOKED
826-131108-0012 VANQUISHED IN THIS FORM I TRIED WHAT ALONE REMAINED TO ME AND ASSUMED THE FORM OF A BULL HE GRASPED MY NECK WITH HIS ARM
826-131108-0013 NOR WAS THIS ENOUGH HIS RUTHLESS HAND RENT MY HORN FROM MY HEAD THE NAIADES TOOK IT CONSECRATED IT AND FILLED IT WITH FRAGRANT FLOWERS PLENTY ADOPTED MY HORN AND MADE IT HER OWN AND CALLED IT CORNUCOPIA
826-131108-0014 AND SOUGHT A UNION WITH HER THE MEANING IS THAT THE RIVER IN ITS WINDINGS FLOWED THROUGH PART OF DEJANIRA'S KINGDOM
826-131108-0015 WHEN THE RIVER SWELLED IT MADE ITSELF ANOTHER CHANNEL THUS ITS HEAD WAS HORNED HERCULES PREVENTED THE RETURN OF THESE PERIODICAL OVERFLOWS BY EMBANKMENTS AND CANALS AND THEREFORE HE WAS SAID TO HAVE VANQUISHED THE RIVER GOD AND CUT OFF HIS HORN FINALLY THE LANDS FORMERLY SUBJECT TO OVERFLOW BUT NOW REDEEMED
826-131108-0016 BECAME VERY FERTILE AND THIS IS MEANT BY THE HORN OF PLENTY THERE IS ANOTHER ACCOUNT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE CORNUCOPIA JUPITER AT HIS BIRTH WAS COMMITTED BY HIS MOTHER RHEA TO THE CARE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF MELISSEUS A CRETAN KING THEY FED THE INFANT DEITY WITH THE MILK OF THE GOAT
826-131108-0017 AMALTHEA JUPITER BROKE OFF ONE OF THE HORNS OF THE GOAT AND GAVE IT TO HIS NURSES AND ENDOWED IT WITH THE WONDERFUL POWER OF BECOMING FILLED WITH WHATEVER THE POSSESSOR MIGHT WISH
826-131108-0018 AETNA FROM WHICH THE SMOKE AND FLAMES OF THEIR FURNACES ARE CONSTANTLY ISSUING APOLLO SHOT HIS ARROWS AT THE CYCLOPES WHICH SO INCENSED JUPITER THAT HE CONDEMNED HIM AS A PUNISHMENT TO BECOME THE SERVANT OF A MORTAL FOR THE SPACE OF ONE YEAR
826-131108-0019 AMPHRYSOS ADMETUS WAS A SUITOR WITH OTHERS FOR THE HAND OF ALCESTIS THE DAUGHTER OF PELIAS WHO PROMISED HER TO HIM
826-131108-0020 WHO SHOULD COME FOR HER IN A CHARIOT DRAWN BY LIONS AND BOARS THIS TASK ADMETUS PERFORMED BY THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS DIVINE HERDSMAN AND WAS MADE HAPPY IN THE POSSESSION OF ALCESTIS BUT ADMETUS FELL ILL
826-131108-0021 AND BEING NEAR TO DEATH APOLLO PREVAILED ON THE FATES TO SPARE HIM ON CONDITION THAT SOME ONE WOULD CONSENT TO DIE IN HIS STEAD ADMETUS IN HIS JOY AT THIS REPRIEVE THOUGHT LITTLE OF THE RANSOM AND PERHAPS REMEMBERING THE DECLARATIONS OF ATTACHMENT WHICH HE HAD OFTEN HEARD FROM HIS COURTIERS
826-131108-0022 AND DEPENDENTS FANCIED THAT IT WOULD BE EASY TO FIND A SUBSTITUTE BUT IT WAS NOT SO BRAVE WARRIORS WHO WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE PERILLED THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR PRINCE SHRUNK FROM THE THOUGHT OF DYING FOR HIM ON THE BED OF SICKNESS
826-131108-0023 MEN ASKED
826-131108-0024 THEY CANNOT IN THE COURSE OF NATURE LIVE MUCH LONGER AND WHO CAN FEEL LIKE THEM THE CALL TO RESCUE THE LIFE THEY GAVE FROM AN UNTIMELY END BUT THE PARENTS DISTRESSED THOUGH THEY WERE AT THE THOUGHT OF LOSING HIM SHRUNK FROM THE CALL THEN ALCESTIS WITH A GENEROUS SELF DEVOTION
826-131108-0025 PROFFERED HERSELF AS THE SUBSTITUTE ADMETUS FOND AS HE WAS OF LIFE WOULD NOT HAVE SUBMITTED TO RECEIVE IT AT SUCH A COST BUT THERE WAS NO REMEDY THE CONDITION IMPOSED BY THE FATES HAD BEEN MET AND THE DECREE WAS IRREVOCABLE ALCESTIS SICKENED AS ADMETUS REVIVED
826-131108-0026 JUST AT THIS TIME HERCULES ARRIVED AT THE PALACE OF ADMETUS AND FOUND ALL THE INMATES IN GREAT DISTRESS FOR THE IMPENDING LOSS OF THE DEVOTED WIFE AND BELOVED MISTRESS HERCULES TO WHOM NO LABOR WAS TOO ARDUOUS RESOLVED TO ATTEMPT HER RESCUE
826-131108-0027 HE WENT AND LAY IN WAIT AT THE DOOR OF THE CHAMBER OF THE DYING QUEEN AND WHEN DEATH CAME FOR HIS PREY HE SEIZED HIM AND FORCED HIM TO RESIGN HIS VICTIM ALCESTIS RECOVERED AND WAS RESTORED TO HER HUSBAND
826-131108-0028 MILTON ALLUDES TO THE STORY OF ALCESTIS IN HIS SONNET ON HIS DECEASED WIFE METHOUGHT I SAW MY LATE ESPOUSED SAINT BROUGHT TO ME
826-131108-0029 TO HER GLAD HUSBAND GAVE RESCUED FROM DEATH BY FORCE THOUGH PALE AND FAINT J R LOWELL HAS CHOSEN THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS FOR THE SUBJECT OF A SHORT POEM HE MAKES THAT EVENT THE FIRST INTRODUCTION OF POETRY TO MEN MEN CALLED HIM
826-131108-0030 BUT A SHIFTLESS YOUTH IN WHOM NO GOOD THEY SAW AND YET UNWITTINGLY IN TRUTH THEY MADE HIS CARELESS WORDS THEIR LAW AND DAY BY DAY MORE HOLY GREW EACH SPOT WHERE HE HAD TROD TILL AFTER POETS ONLY KNEW THEIR FIRST BORN BROTHER WAS A GOD
826-131108-0031 ANTIGONE
826-131108-0032 ANTIGONE WAS AS BRIGHT AN EXAMPLE OF FILIAL AND SISTERLY FIDELITY AS WAS ALCESTIS OF CONNUBIAL DEVOTION SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF OEDIPUS AND JOCASTA WHO WITH ALL THEIR DESCENDANTS WERE THE VICTIMS OF AN UNRELENTING FATE
826-131108-0033 AND WAS DRIVEN FORTH FROM HIS KINGDOM THEBES DREADED AND ABANDONED BY ALL MEN AS AN OBJECT OF DIVINE VENGEANCE ANTIGONE HIS DAUGHTER ALONE SHARED HIS WANDERINGS AND REMAINED WITH HIM TILL HE DIED AND THEN RETURNED TO THEBES HER BROTHERS
826-131108-0034 HAD AGREED TO SHARE THE KINGDOM BETWEEN THEM AND REIGN ALTERNATELY YEAR BY YEAR
826-131108-0035 WHEN HIS TIME EXPIRED REFUSED TO SURRENDER THE KINGDOM TO HIS BROTHER POLYNICES FLED TO ADRASTUS KING OF ARGOS WHO GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE AND AIDED HIM WITH AN ARMY TO ENFORCE HIS CLAIM TO THE KINGDOM THIS LED TO THE CELEBRATED EXPEDITION OF THE SEVEN AGAINST THEBES
826-131108-0036 WHICH FURNISHED AMPLE MATERIALS FOR THE EPIC AND TRAGIC POETS OF GREECE
826-131108-0037 AND KNEW BY HIS ART THAT NO ONE OF THE LEADERS EXCEPT ADRASTUS WOULD LIVE TO RETURN BUT AMPHIARAUS ON HIS MARRIAGE TO
826-131108-0038 POLYNICES KNOWING THIS GAVE ERIPHYLE THE COLLAR OF HARMONIA

826-131108-0040 BUT COULD NOT AVERT HIS DESTINY PURSUED BY THE ENEMY HE FLED ALONG THE RIVER WHEN A THUNDERBOLT LAUNCHED BY JUPITER OPENED THE GROUND AND HE
826-131108-0041 BUT WE MUST NOT OMIT TO RECORD THE FIDELITY
826-131108-0042 AS AN OFFSET TO THE WEAKNESS OF ERIPHYLE
826-131108-0043 PLACING A LADDER AGAINST THE WALL HE MOUNTED BUT JUPITER OFFENDED AT HIS IMPIOUS LANGUAGE STRUCK HIM WITH A THUNDERBOLT WHEN HIS OBSEQUIES WERE CELEBRATED EVADNE CAST HERSELF ON HIS FUNERAL PILE AND PERISHED EARLY IN THE CONTEST
826-131108-0044 THE GODDESS IN HER WRATH DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS SIGHT BUT AFTERWARDS RELENTING GAVE HIM IN COMPENSATION THE KNOWLEDGE OF FUTURE EVENTS
826-131108-0045 HE DECLARED THAT VICTORY SHOULD FALL TO THEBES IF MENOECEUS
826-131108-0046 THE HEROIC YOUTH LEARNING THE RESPONSE THREW AWAY HIS LIFE IN THE FIRST ENCOUNTER
