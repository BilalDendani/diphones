6159-58440-0001 YET GALLIARD DELAYED THE STROKE HE HELD HIS SWORD POISED THE POINT AIMED AT JOSEPH'S BREAST AND HOLDING HE WATCHED HIM MARKING EACH PHASE OF THE TERROR REFLECTED UPON HIS LIVID COUNTENANCE HE WAS LOTH TO STRIKE
6159-58440-0002 FOR TO STRIKE WOULD MEAN TO END THIS EXQUISITE TORTURE OF HORROR TO WHICH HE WAS SUBJECTING HIM BROKEN JOSEPH HAD BEEN BEFORE AND PASSIVE NOW OF A SUDDEN HE GREW VIOLENT AGAIN BUT IN A DIFFERENT WAY HE FLUNG HIMSELF UPON HIS KNEES BEFORE SIR
6159-58440-0003 CRISPIN AND PASSIONATELY HE PLEADED FOR THE SPARING OF HIS MISERABLE LIFE CRISPIN LOOKED ON WITH AN EYE BOTH OF SCORN AND OF COLD RELISH IT WAS THUS HE WISHED TO SEE HIM BROKEN AND AGONIZED SUFFERING THUS SOMETHING OF ALL THAT WHICH
6159-58440-0004 HE HIMSELF HAD SUFFERED THROUGH DESPAIR IN THE YEARS THAT WERE SPED WITH SATISFACTION THEN HE WATCHED HIS VICTIM'S AGONY HE WATCHED IT TOO WITH SCORN AND SOME LOATHING FOR A CRAVEN WAS IN HIS EYES AN UGLY SIGHT AND JOSEPH IN THAT MOMENT WAS TRULY
6159-58440-0005 BECOME AS VILE A COWARD AS EVER MAN BEHELD HIS PARCHMENT LIKE FACE WAS GREY AND MOTTLED HIS BROW BEDEWED WITH SWEAT HIS LIPS WERE BLUE AND QUIVERING HIS EYES BLOODSHOT AND ALMOST THREATENING TEARS
6159-58440-0006 IN THE SILENCE OF ONE WHO WAITS STOOD CRISPIN LISTENING CALM AND UNMOVED AS THOUGH HE HEARD NOT UNTIL JOSEPH'S WHINING PRAYERS CULMINATED IN AN OFFER TO MAKE REPARATION THEN CRISPIN BROKE IN AT LENGTH WITH AN IMPATIENT GESTURE
6159-58440-0007 WHAT REPARATION CAN YOU MAKE YOU MURDERER CAN YOU RESTORE TO ME THE WIFE AND CHILD YOU BUTCHERED EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO I CAN RESTORE YOUR CHILD AT LEAST RETURNED THE OTHER I CAN AND WILL RESTORE HIM TO YOU IF YOU BUT STAY YOUR HAND
6159-58440-0008 THAT AND MUCH MORE WILL I DO TO REPAIR THE PAST UNCONSCIOUSLY CRISPIN LOWERED HIS SWORD ARM
6159-58440-0009 HIS JAW WAS FALLEN AND THE GRIM FIRMNESS ALL GONE FROM HIS FACE AND REPLACED BY AMAZEMENT THEN UNBELIEF FOLLOWED BY INQUIRY THEN UNBELIEF AGAIN THE PALLOR OF HIS CHEEKS SEEMED TO INTENSIFY
6159-58440-0010 AT LAST HOWEVER HE BROKE INTO A HARD LAUGH WHAT LIE IS THIS YOU OFFER ME ZOUNDS MAN ARE YOU NOT AFRAID IT IS NO LIE JOSEPH CRIED IN ACCENTS SO EARNEST THAT SOME OF THE UNBELIEF PASSED AGAIN FROM GALLIARD'S FACE
6159-58440-0011 IT IS THE TRUTH GOD'S TRUTH YOUR SON LIVES HELL HOUND IT IS A LIE ON THAT FELL NIGHT AS I SWOONED UNDER YOUR COWARDLY THRUST I HEARD YOU CALLING TO YOUR BROTHER TO SLIT THE SQUALLING BASTARD'S THROAT THOSE WERE YOUR VERY WORDS MASTER JOSEPH

6159-58440-0013 THE KNIGHT SANK ON TO A CHAIR AS THOUGH BEREFT OF STRENGTH HE SOUGHT TO THINK BUT THINKING COHERENTLY HE COULD NOT AT LAST HOW SHALL I KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT LYING WHAT PROOF CAN YOU ADVANCE HE DEMANDED HOARSELY
6159-58440-0014 I SWEAR THAT WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU IS TRUE I SWEAR IT BY THE CROSS OF OUR REDEEMER HE PROTESTED WITH A SOLEMNITY THAT WAS NOT WITHOUT EFFECT UPON CRISPIN NEVERTHELESS HE SNEERED I ASK FOR PROOFS MAN NOT OATHS
6159-58440-0015 WHAT PROOFS CAN YOU AFFORD ME THERE ARE THE MAN AND THE WOMAN WHOM THE LAD WAS REARED BY AND WHERE SHALL I FIND THEM JOSEPH OPENED HIS LIPS TO ANSWER THEN CLOSED THEM AGAIN
6159-58440-0016 HE REGAINED CONFIDENCE AT CRISPIN'S TONE AND QUESTIONS GATHERING FROM BOTH THAT THE KNIGHT WAS WILLING TO BELIEVE IF PROOF WERE SET BEFORE HIM HE ROSE TO HIS FEET AND WHEN NEXT HE SPOKE HIS VOICE HAD WON BACK MUCH OF ITS
6159-58440-0017 HABITUAL CALM DELIBERATENESS THAT SAID HE I WILL TELL YOU WHEN YOU HAVE PROMISED TO GO HENCE LEAVING GREGORY AND ME UNHARMED I WILL SUPPLY YOU WITH WHAT MONEY YOU MAY NEED AND I WILL GIVE YOU A LETTER TO THOSE PEOPLE SO COUCHED THAT
6159-58440-0018 WHAT THEY TELL YOU BY VIRTUE OF IT SHALL BE A CORROBORATION OF MY WORDS HIS ELBOW RESTING UPON THE TABLE AND HIS HAND TO HIS BROW SO THAT IT SHADED HIS EYES SAT CRISPIN LONG IN THOUGHT SWAYED BY EMOTIONS AND DOUBTS
6159-58440-0019 THE LIKE OF WHICH HE HAD NEVER YET KNOWN IN THE WHOLE OF HIS CHEQUERED LIFE WAS JOSEPH LYING TO HIM THAT WAS THE QUESTION THAT REPEATEDLY AROSE AND ODDLY ENOUGH FOR ALL HIS MISTRUST OF THE MAN HE WAS INCLINED TO ACCOUNT TRUE THE RING OF HIS WORDS
6159-58440-0020 JOSEPH WATCHED HIM WITH MUCH ANXIETY AND SOME HOPE AT LENGTH CRISPIN WITHDREW HIS HANDS FROM EYES THAT WERE GROWN HAGGARD AND ROSE LET US SEE THE LETTER THAT YOU WILL WRITE SAID HE THERE YOU HAVE PEN INK AND PAPER WRITE
6159-58440-0021 YOU PROMISE ASKED JOSEPH I WILL TELL YOU WHEN YOU HAVE WRITTEN IN A HAND THAT SHOOK SOMEWHAT JOSEPH WROTE A FEW LINES THEN HANDED CRISPIN THE SHEET WHEREON HE READ THE BEARER OF THIS IS SIR CRISPIN GALLIARD
6159-58440-0022 WHO IS INTIMATELY INTERESTED IN THE MATTER THAT LIES BETWIXT US AND WHOM I PRAY YOU ANSWER FULLY AND ACCURATELY THE QUESTIONS HE MAY PUT YOU IN THAT CONNEXION I UNDERSTAND SAID CRISPIN SLOWLY YES IT WILL SERVE NOW THE SUPERSCRIPTION
6159-58440-0023 AND HE RETURNED THE PAPER ASHBURN WAS HIMSELF AGAIN BY NOW HE REALIZED THE ADVANTAGE HE HAD GAINED AND HE WOULD NOT EASILY RELINQUISH IT I SHALL ADD THE SUPERSCRIPTION SAID HE CALMLY WHEN YOU SWEAR TO DEPART WITHOUT FURTHER MOLESTING US
6159-58440-0024 CRISPIN PAUSED A MOMENT WEIGHING THE POSITION WELL IN HIS MIND IF JOSEPH LIED TO HIM NOW HE WOULD FIND MEANS TO RETURN HE TOLD HIMSELF
6159-58440-0025 JOSEPH DIPPED HIS PEN AND PAUSED MEDITATIVELY TO WATCH A DROP OF INK WHEREWITH IT WAS OVERLADEN FALL BACK INTO THE HORN THE BRIEFEST OF PAUSES WAS IT YET IT WAS NOT THE ACCIDENT IT APPEARED TO BE
6159-58440-0026 HITHERTO JOSEPH HAD BEEN AS SINCERE AS HE HAD BEEN EARNEST INTENT ALONE UPON SAVING HIS LIFE AT ALL COSTS AND FORGETTING IN HIS FEAR OF THE PRESENT THE DANGERS THAT THE FUTURE MIGHT HOLD FOR HIM WERE CRISPIN GALLIARD STILL AT LARGE
6159-58440-0027 BUT IN THAT SECOND OF DIPPING HIS QUILL
6159-58440-0028 AND THAT CRISPIN WOULD GO FORTH AS HE SAID
6159-58440-0029 AS HE WATCHED THE DROP OF INK ROLL FROM HIS PEN POINT HE REMEMBERED THAT IN LONDON THERE DWELT AT THE SIGN OF THE ANCHOR IN THAMES STREET ONE COLONEL PRIDE WHOSE SON THIS GALLIARD HAD SLAIN AND WHO DID HE ONCE LAY HANDS UPON HIM
6159-58440-0030 WAS NOT LIKE TO LET HIM GO AGAIN IN A SECOND WAS THE THOUGHT CONCEIVED AND THE DETERMINATION TAKEN AND AS HE FOLDED THE LETTER AND SET UPON IT THE SUPERSCRIPTION JOSEPH FELT THAT HE COULD HAVE CRIED OUT IN HIS EXULTATION AT THE CUNNING MANNER IN WHICH HE WAS OUTWITTING HIS ENEMY
6159-58440-0031 CRISPIN TOOK THE PACKAGE AND READ THEREON THIS IS TO MISTER HENRY LANE AT THE SIGN OF THE ANCHOR THAMES STREET LONDON THE NAME WAS A FICTITIOUS ONE ONE THAT JOSEPH HAD SET DOWN UPON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
6159-58440-0032 HIS INTENTION BEING TO SEND A MESSENGER THAT SHOULD OUTSTRIP SIR CRISPIN AND WARN COLONEL PRIDE OF HIS COMING IT IS WELL WAS CRISPIN'S ONLY COMMENT HE TOO WAS GROWN CALM AGAIN AND FULLY MASTER OF HIMSELF
6159-58440-0033 HE PLACED THE LETTER CAREFULLY WITHIN THE BREAST OF HIS DOUBLET IF YOU HAVE LIED TO ME IF THIS IS BUT A SHIFT TO WIN YOUR MISERABLE LIFE REST ASSURED MASTER ASHBURN THAT YOU HAVE BUT PUT OFF THE DAY FOR A VERY LITTLE WHILE
6159-58440-0034 IT WAS ON JOSEPH'S LIPS TO ANSWER THAT NONE OF US ARE IMMORTAL BUT HE BETHOUGHT HIM THAT THE PLEASANTRY MIGHT BE ILL TIMED AND BOWED IN SILENCE GALLIARD TOOK HIS HAT AND CLOAK FROM THE CHAIR ON WHICH HE HAD PLACED THEM UPON DESCENDING THAT EVENING THEN HE TURNED AGAIN TO JOSEPH
6159-58440-0035 YOU SPOKE OF MONEY A MOMENT AGO HE SAID IN THE TONES OF ONE DEMANDING WHAT IS HIS OWN THE TONES OF A GENTLEMAN SPEAKING TO HIS STEWARD I WILL TAKE TWO HUNDRED CAROLUSES MORE I CANNOT CARRY IN COMFORT JOSEPH GASPED AT THE AMOUNT
6159-58440-0036 THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT THERE WAS A BRACE OF PISTOLS IN HIS STUDY IF HE COULD GET THOSE HE WOULD SETTLE MATTERS THERE AND THEN WITHOUT THE AID OF COLONEL PRIDE I WILL FETCH THE MONEY SAID HE BETRAYING HIS PURPOSE BY HIS ALACRITY
6159-58440-0037 BY YOUR LEAVE MASTER ASHBURN I WILL COME WITH YOU JOSEPH'S EYES FLASHED HIM A QUICK LOOK OF BAFFLED HATE AS YOU WILL SAID HE WITH AN ILL GRACE AS THEY PASSED OUT CRISPIN TURNED TO KENNETH
6159-58440-0038 KENNETH BENT HIS HEAD WITHOUT REPLYING BUT MASTER GREGORY REQUIRED LITTLE WATCHING HE LAY A HELPLESS HALF SWOONING HEAP UPON THE FLOOR WHICH HE HAD SMEARED WITH THE BLOOD OOZING FROM HIS WOUNDED SHOULDER
6159-58440-0039 DURING THE BRIEF WHILE THEY WERE ALONE TOGETHER
6159-58440-0040 HE SAT HIMSELF DOWN UPON THE NEAREST CHAIR AND WITH HIS CHIN IN HIS HANDS AND HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES HE PONDERED OVER THE MISERABLE PREDICAMENT INTO WHICH SIR CRISPIN HAD GOT HIM
6159-58440-0041 WAS HIS ENMITY AT THAT MOMENT TOWARDS THE KNIGHT THAT GALLIARD SHOULD BE UPON THE EVE OF FINDING HIS SON AND A SEQUEL TO THE STORY HE HAD HEARD FROM HIM THAT NIGHT IN WORCESTER WAS TO KENNETH A THING OF NO INTEREST OR MOMENT
6159-58440-0042 GALLIARD HAD RUINED HIM WITH THESE ASHBURNS HE COULD NEVER NOW HOPE TO WIN THE HAND OF CYNTHIA TO ACHIEVE WHICH HE HAD BEEN WILLING TO TURN BOTH FOOL AND KNAVE AYE HAD TURNED BOTH
6159-58440-0043 THAT HE WAS GONE SOUTH TO MARRY A GREAT ENGLISH HEIRESS THAT AT SUCH A SEASON HE COULD THINK OF THIS BUT SERVES TO PROVE THE SHALLOW NATURE OF HIS FEELINGS A LOVE WAS HIS THAT HAD GAIN AND VANITY FOR ITS FOUNDATION IN FACT IT WAS NO LOVE AT ALL
6159-58440-0044 FOR WHAT HE ACCOUNTED LOVE FOR CYNTHIA WAS BUT THE LOVE OF HIMSELF WHICH THROUGH CYNTHIA HE SOUGHT TO INDULGE HE CURSED THE ILL LUCK THAT HAD BROUGHT CRISPIN INTO HIS LIFE HE CURSED CRISPIN FOR THE EVIL HE HAD SUFFERED FROM HIM
6159-58440-0045 FORGETTING THAT BUT FOR CRISPIN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CARRION A MONTH AGO AND MORE DEEP AT HIS BITTER MUSINGS WAS HE WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN TO ADMIT JOSEPH FOLLOWED BY GALLIARD
6159-58440-0046 YOU MAY UNTRUSS HIM KENNETH WHEN I AM GONE
6159-58440-0047 FARE YOU WELL HE ADDED WITH UNUSUAL GENTLENESS AND TURNING A GLANCE THAT WAS ALMOST REGRETFUL UPON THE LAD WE ARE NOT LIKE TO MEET AGAIN BUT SHOULD WE I TRUST IT MAY BE IN HAPPIER TIMES
6159-58440-0048 IF I HAVE HARMED YOU IN THIS BUSINESS REMEMBER THAT MY NEED WAS GREAT FARE YOU WELL AND HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TAKE YOURSELF TO HELL SIR ANSWERED KENNETH TURNING HIS BACK UPON HIM
