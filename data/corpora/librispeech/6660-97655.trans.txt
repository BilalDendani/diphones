6660-97655-0000 AND IS EVER BRED IN RIVERS RELATING TO THE SEA YET SO HIGH OR FAR FROM IT AS ADMITS OF NO TINCTURE OF SALT OR BRACKISHNESS
6660-97655-0001 IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST SOME SAY THAT THEN THEY DIG A HOLE OR GRAVE IN A SAFE PLACE IN THE GRAVEL AND THERE PLACE THEIR EGGS OR SPAWN AFTER THE MELTER HAS DONE HIS NATURAL OFFICE AND THEN HIDE IT MOST CUNNINGLY
6660-97655-0002 AND COVER IT OVER WITH GRAVEL AND STONES AND THEN LEAVE IT TO THEIR CREATOR'S PROTECTION WHO BY A GENTLE HEAT WHICH HE INFUSES INTO THAT COLD ELEMENT MAKES IT BROOD AND BEGET LIFE IN THE SPAWN AND TO BECOME SAMLETS EARLY IN THE SPRING NEXT FOLLOWING
6660-97655-0003 THE SALMONS HAVING SPENT THEIR APPOINTED TIME AND DONE THIS NATURAL DUTY IN THE FRESH WATERS THEY THEN HASTE TO THE SEA BEFORE WINTER BOTH THE MELTER AND SPAWNER BUT IF THEY BE STOPS BY FLOOD GATES OR WEIRS OR LOST IN THE FRESH WATERS
6660-97655-0004 THEN THOSE SO LEFT BEHIND BY DEGREES GROW SICK AND LEAN AND UNSEASONABLE AND KIPPER THAT IS TO SAY HAVE BONY GRISTLES GROW OUT OF THEIR LOWER CHAPS NOT UNLIKE A HAWK'S BEAK WHICH HINDERS THEIR FEEDING AND IN TIME SUCH FISH SO LEFT BEHIND
6660-97655-0005 PINE AWAY AND DIE TIS OBSERVED THAT HE MAY LIVE THUS ONE YEAR FROM THE SEA BUT HE THEN GROWS INSIPID AND TASTELESS AND LOSES BOTH HIS BLOOD AND STRENGTH AND PINES AND DIES THE SECOND YEAR AND TIS NOTED THAT THOSE LITTLE SALMONS CALLED SKEGGERS
6660-97655-0006 WHICH ABOUND IN MANY RIVERS RELATING TO THE SEA ARE BRED BY SUCH SICK SALMONS THAT MIGHT NOT GO TO THE SEA AND THAT THOUGH THEY ABOUND YET THEY NEVER THRIVE TO ANY CONSIDERABLE BIGNESS BUT IF THE OLD SALMON GETS TO THE SEA THEN THAT GRISTLE WHICH SHEWS HIM TO BE KIPPER
6660-97655-0007 WEARS AWAY OR IS CAST OFF AS THE EAGLE IS SAID TO CAST HIS BILL AND HE RECOVERS HIS STRENGTH AND COMES NEXT SUMMER TO THE SAME RIVER IF IT BE POSSIBLE TO ENJOY THE FORMER PLEASURES THAT THERE POSSESS HIM FOR AS ONE HAS WITTILY OBSERVED
6660-97655-0008 HE HAS LIKE SOME PERSONS OF HONOUR AND RICHES WHICH HAVE BOTH THEIR WINTER AND SUMMER HOUSES THE FRESH RIVERS FOR SUMMER AND THE SALT WATER FOR WINTER TO SPEND HIS LIFE IN WHICH IS NOT AS SIR FRANCIS BACON HATH OBSERVED IN HIS HISTORY OF LIFE AND DEATH ABOVE TEN YEARS
6660-97655-0009 AND IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT THOUGH THE SALMON DOES GROW BIG IN THE SEA YET HE GROWS NOT FAT BUT IN FRESH RIVERS AND IT IS OBSERVED THAT THE FARTHER THEY GET FROM THE SEA THEY BE BOTH THE FATTER AND BETTER
6660-97655-0010 NEXT I SHALL TELL YOU THAT THOUGH THEY MAKE VERY HARD SHIFT TO GET OUT OF THE FRESH RIVERS INTO THE SEA YET THEY WILL MAKE HARDER SHIFT TO GET OUT OF THE SALT INTO THE FRESH RIVERS TO SPAWN OR POSSESS THE PLEASURES THAT THEY HAVE FORMERLY FOUND IN THEM
6660-97655-0011 OR STOPS IN THE WATER EVEN TO A HEIGHT BEYOND COMMON BELIEF GESNER SPEAKS OF SUCH PLACES AS ARE KNOWN TO BE ABOVE EIGHT FEET HIGH ABOVE WATER AND OUR CAMDEN MENTIONS IN HIS BRITANNIA THE LIKE WONDER TO BE IN PEMBROKESHIRE
6660-97655-0012 WHERE THE RIVER TIVY FALLS INTO THE SEA AND THAT THE FALL IS SO DOWNRIGHT AND SO HIGH THAT THE PEOPLE STAND AND WONDER AT THE STRENGTH AND SLEIGHT BY WHICH THEY SEE THE SALMON USE TO GET OUT OF THE SEA INTO THE SAID RIVER AND THE MANNER AND HEIGHT OF THE PLACE IS SO NOTABLE
6660-97655-0013 THAT IT IS KNOWN FAR BY THE NAME OF THE SALMON LEAP CONCERNING WHICH TAKE THIS ALSO OUT OF MICHAEL DRAYTON MY HONEST OLD FRIEND AS HE TELLS IT YOU IN HIS POLYOLBION AND WHEN THE SALMON SEEKS A FRESHER STREAM TO FIND
6660-97655-0014 WHICH HITHER FROM THE SEA COMES YEARLY BY HIS KIND AS HE TOWARDS SEASON GROWS AND STEMS THE WATRY TRACT WHERE TIVY FALLING DOWN MAKES AN HIGH CATARACT FORC'D BY THE RISING ROCKS THAT THERE HER COURSE OPPOSE AS THO WITHIN HER BOUNDS THEY MEANT HER TO INCLOSE
6660-97655-0015 HERE WHEN THE LABOURING FISH DOES AT THE FOOT ARRIVE AND FINDS THAT BY HIS STRENGTH HE DOES BUT VAINLY STRIVE HIS TAIL TAKES IN HIS MOUTH AND BENDING LIKE A BOW THAT'S TO FULL COMPASS DRAWN ALOFT HIMSELF DOTH THROW THEN SPRINGING AT HIS HEIGHT
6660-97655-0016 AS DOTH A LITTLE WAND THAT BENDED END TO END AND STARTED FROM MAN'S HAND FAR OFF ITSELF DOTH CAST SO DOES THAT SALMON VAULT AND IF AT FIRST HE FAIL HIS SECOND SUMMERSAULT HE INSTANTLY ESSAYS AND FROM HIS NIMBLE RING
6660-97655-0017 THIS MICHAEL DRAYTON TELLS YOU OF THIS LEAP OR SUMMERSAULT OF THE SALMON AND NEXT I SHALL TELL YOU THAT IT IS OBSERVED BY GESNER AND OTHERS THAT THERE IS NO BETTER SALMON THAN IN ENGLAND AND THAT THOUGH SOME OF OUR NORTHERN COUNTIES HAVE AS FAT
6660-97655-0018 IT IS SAID THAT AFTER HE IS GOT INTO THE SEA HE BECOMES FROM A SAMLET NOT SO BIG AS A GUDGEON TO BE A SALMON IN AS SHORT A TIME AS A GOSLING BECOMES TO BE A GOOSE MUCH OF THIS HAS BEEN OBSERVED BY TYING A RIBAND OR SOME KNOWN TAPE OR THREAD
6660-97655-0019 IN THE TAIL OF SOME YOUNG SALMONS WHICH HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN WEIRS AS THEY HAVE SWIMMED TOWARDS THE SALT WATER AND THEN BY TAKING A PART OF THEM AGAIN WITH THE KNOWN MARK AT THE SAME PLACE AT THEIR RETURN FROM THE SEA WHICH IS USUALLY ABOUT SIX MONTHS AFTER
6660-97655-0020 AND THE LIKE EXPERIMENT HATH BEEN TRIED UPON YOUNG SWALLOWS WHO HAVE AFTER SIX MONTHS ABSENCE BEEN OBSERVED TO RETURN TO THE SAME CHIMNEY THERE TO MAKE THEIR NESTS AND HABITATIONS FOR THE SUMMER FOLLOWING WHICH HAS INCLINED MANY TO THINK
6660-97655-0021 THAT EVERY SALMON USUALLY RETURNS TO THE SAME RIVER IN WHICH IT WAS BRED AS YOUNG PIGEONS TAKEN OUT OF THE SAME DOVECOTE HAVE ALSO BEEN OBSERVED TO DO AND YOU ARE YET TO OBSERVE FURTHER THAT THE HE SALMON IS USUALLY BIGGER THAN THE SPAWNER AND THAT HE IS MORE KIPPER
6660-97655-0022 AND LESS ABLE TO ENDURE A WINTER IN THE FRESH WATER THAN THE SHE IS YET SHE IS AT THAT TIME OF LOOKING LESS KIPPER AND BETTER AS WATRY AND AS BAD MEAT AND YET YOU ARE TO OBSERVE THAT AS THERE IS NO GENERAL RULE WITHOUT AN EXCEPTION
6660-97655-0023 SO THERE ARE SOME FEW RIVERS IN THIS NATION THAT HAVE TROUTS AND SALMON IN SEASON IN WINTER AS TIS CERTAIN THERE BE IN THE RIVER WYE IN MONMOUTHSHIRE WHERE THEY BE IN SEASON AS CAMDEN OBSERVES FROM SEPTEMBER TILL APRIL
6660-97655-0024 BUT MY SCHOLAR THE OBSERVATION OF THIS AND MANY OTHER THINGS I MUST IN MANNERS OMIT BECAUSE THEY WILL PROVE TOO LARGE FOR OUR NARROW COMPASS OF TIME AND THEREFORE
6660-97655-0025 HOW TO FISH FOR THIS SALMON AND FOR THAT FIRST YOU SHALL OBSERVE THAT USUALLY HE STAYS NOT LONG IN A PLACE AS TROUTS WILL BUT AS I SAID COVETS STILL TO GO NEARER THE SPRING HEAD AND THAT HE DOES NOT AS THE TROUT AND MANY OTHER FISH
6660-97655-0026 AND THEN MOST USUALLY AT A LOB OR GARDEN WORM WHICH SHOULD BE WELL SCOURED
6660-97655-0027 KEPT SEVEN OR EIGHT DAYS IN MOSS BEFORE YOU FISH WITH THEM AND IF YOU DOUBLE YOUR TIME OF EIGHT INTO SIXTEEN TWENTY OR MORE DAYS IT IS STILL THE BETTER FOR THE WORMS WILL STILL BE CLEARER TOUGHER AND MORE LIVELY
6660-97655-0028 AND CONTINUE SO LONGER UPON YOUR HOOK AND THEY MAY BE KEPT LONGER BY KEEPING THEM COOL AND IN FRESH MOSS AND SOME ADVISE TO PUT CAMPHIRE INTO IT NOTE ALSO THAT MANY USED TO FISH FOR A SALMON WITH A RING OF WIRE ON THE TOP OF THEIR ROD
6660-97655-0029 NOW WITH GOD A NOTED FISHER BOTH FOR TROUT AND SALMON AND HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE WOULD USUALLY TAKE THREE OR FOUR WORMS OUT OF HIS BAG AND PUT THEM INTO A LITTLE BOX IN HIS POCKET
6660-97655-0030 HALF AN HOUR OR MORE BEFORE HE WOULD BAIT HIS HOOK WITH THEM I HAVE ASKED HIM HIS REASON AND HE HAS REPLIED HE DID BUT PICK THE BEST OUT TO BE IN READINESS AGAINST HE BAITED HIS HOOK THE NEXT TIME BUT HE HAS BEEN OBSERVED BOTH BY OTHERS AND MYSELF
6660-97655-0031 TO CATCH MORE FISH THAN I OR ANY OTHER BODY THAT HAS EVER GONE A FISHING WITH HIM COULD DO AND ESPECIALLY SALMONS
6660-97655-0032 THAT THE BOX IN WHICH HE PUT THOSE WORMS WAS ANOINTED WITH A DROP OR TWO OR THREE OF THE OIL OF IVY BERRIES MADE BY EXPRESSION OR INFUSION AND TOLD THAT BY THE WORMS REMAINING IN THAT BOX AN HOUR OR A LIKE TIME THEY HAD INCORPORATED A KIND OF SMELL
6660-97655-0033 THAT WAS IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH TO FORCE ANY FISH WITHIN THE SMELL OF THEM TO BITE THIS I HEARD NOT LONG SINCE FROM A FRIEND BUT HAVE NOT TRIED IT YET I GRANT IT PROBABLE AND REFER MY READER TO SIR FRANCIS BACON'S NATURAL HISTORY
6660-97655-0034 WHERE HE PROVES FISHES MAY HEAR AND DOUBTLESS CAN MORE PROBABLY SMELL AND I AM CERTAIN GESNER SAYS THE OTTER CAN SMELL IN THE WATER AND I KNOW NOT BUT THAT FISH MAY DO SO TOO TIS LEFT FOR A LOVER OF ANGLING
6660-97655-0035 OR ANY THAT DESIRES TO IMPROVE THAT ART TO TRY THIS CONCLUSION I SHALL ALSO IMPART TWO OTHER EXPERIMENTS BUT NOT TRIED BY MYSELF WHICH I WILL DELIVER IN THE SAME WORDS THAT THEY WERE GIVEN ME BY AN EXCELLENT ANGLER AND A VERY FRIEND IN WRITING
6660-97655-0036 MIXED WITH TURPENTINE AND HIVE HONEY AND ANOINT YOUR BAIT THEREWITH AND IT WILL DOUBTLESS DRAW THE FISH TO IT THE OTHER IS THIS VULNERA HEDERAE GRANDISSIMAE INFLICTA SUDANT BALSAMUM OLEO GELATO
6660-97655-0037 TIS SUPREMELY SWEET TO ANY FISH AND YET ASSA FOETIDA MAY DO THE LIKE BUT IN THESE I HAVE NO GREAT FAITH YET GRANT IT PROBABLE AND HAVE HAD FROM SOME CHYMICAL MEN NAMELY FROM SIR GEORGE HASTINGS AND OTHERS
6660-97655-0038 AN AFFIRMATION OF THEM TO BE VERY ADVANTAGEOUS
6660-97655-0039 ESPECIALLY NOT IN THIS PLACE I MIGHT HERE BEFORE I TAKE MY LEAVE OF THE SALMON TELL YOU THAT THERE IS MORE THAN ONE SORT OF THEM AS NAMELY
6660-97655-0040 AND ANOTHER CALLED IN SOME PLACES A SAMLET OR BY SOME A SKEGGER BUT THESE AND OTHERS WHICH I FORBEAR TO NAME MAY BE FISH OF ANOTHER KIND AND DIFFER AS WE KNOW A HERRING AND A PILCHARD DO WHICH I THINK ARE AS DIFFERENT AS THE RIVERS IN WHICH THEY BREED
6660-97655-0041 AND MUST BY ME BE LEFT TO THE DISQUISITIONS OF MEN OF MORE LEISURE AND OF GREATER ABILITIES THAN I PROFESS MYSELF TO HAVE AND LASTLY I AM TO BORROW SO MUCH OF YOUR PROMISED PATIENCE AS TO TELL YOU
6660-97655-0042 THAT THE TROUT OR SALMON BEING IN SEASON HAVE AT THEIR FIRST TAKING OUT OF THE WATER WHICH CONTINUES DURING LIFE THEIR BODIES ADORNED
