6106-58195-0000 THE TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WITH WHICH I PURCHASED THE FREEDOM OF MYSELF AND SON I CONSENTED TO ACCEPT ONLY AS A LOAN I WENT TO WORK IN EARNEST AND IN A SHORT TIME PAID EVERY CENT
6106-58195-0001 THAT WAS SO KINDLY ADVANCED BY MY LADY PATRONS OF SAINT LOUIS ALL THIS TIME MY HUSBAND WAS A SOURCE OF TROUBLE TO ME AND A BURDEN TOO CLOSE OCCUPATION WITH MY NEEDLE HAD ITS EFFECTS UPON MY HEALTH
6106-58195-0002 AND FEELING EXHAUSTED WITH WORK I DETERMINED TO MAKE A CHANGE I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH MISTER KECKLEY INFORMED HIM THAT SINCE HE PERSISTED IN DISSIPATION WE MUST SEPARATE
6106-58195-0003 AND THAT I SHOULD NEVER LIVE WITH HIM AGAIN AT LEAST UNTIL I HAD GOOD EVIDENCE OF HIS REFORM HE WAS RAPIDLY DEBASING HIMSELF AND ALTHOUGH I WAS WILLING TO WORK FOR HIM I WAS NOT WILLING TO SHARE HIS DEGRADATION POOR MAN HE HAD HIS FAULTS
6106-58195-0004 BUT OVER THESE FAULTS DEATH HAS DRAWN A VEIL MY HUSBAND IS NOW SLEEPING IN HIS GRAVE AND IN THE SILENT GRAVE I WOULD BURY ALL UNPLEASANT MEMORIES OF HIM I LEFT SAINT LOUIS IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY
6106-58195-0005 TAKING THE CARS DIRECT FOR BALTIMORE WHERE I STOPPED SIX WEEKS ATTEMPTING TO REALIZE A SUM OF MONEY BY FORMING CLASSES OF YOUNG COLORED WOMEN AND TEACHING THEM MY SYSTEM OF CUTTING AND FITTING DRESSES THE SCHEME WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL
6106-58195-0006 FOR AFTER SIX WEEKS OF LABOR AND VEXATION I LEFT BALTIMORE WITH SCARCELY MONEY ENOUGH TO PAY MY FARE TO WASHINGTON ARRIVING IN THE CAPITAL I SOUGHT AND OBTAINED WORK AT TWO DOLLARS AND A HALF PER DAY HOWEVER
6106-58195-0007 AS I WAS NOTIFIED THAT I COULD ONLY REMAIN IN THE CITY TEN DAYS WITHOUT OBTAINING A LICENSE TO DO SO SUCH BEING THE LAW AND AS I DID NOT KNOW WHOM TO APPLY TO FOR ASSISTANCE I WAS SORELY TROUBLED
6106-58195-0008 MY MEANS WERE TOO SCANTY AND MY PROFESSION TOO PRECARIOUS TO WARRANT MY PURCHASING A LICENSE IN MY PERPLEXITY I CALLED ON A LADY FOR WHOM I WAS SEWING MISS RINGOLD
6106-58195-0009 I STATED MY CASE AND SHE KINDLY VOLUNTEERED TO RENDER ME ALL THE ASSISTANCE IN HER POWER SHE CALLED ON MAYOR BURRITT WITH ME AND MISS RINGOLD SUCCEEDED IN MAKING AN ARRANGEMENT FOR ME TO REMAIN IN WASHINGTON
6106-58195-0010 WITHOUT PAYING THE SUM REQUIRED FOR A LICENSE MOREOVER I WAS NOT TO BE MOLESTED I RENTED APARTMENTS IN A GOOD LOCALITY AND SOON HAD A GOOD RUN OF CUSTOM THE SUMMER PASSED WINTER CAME
6106-58195-0011 MISSUS DAVIS WIFE OF SENATOR JEFFERSON DAVIS CAME FROM THE SOUTH IN NOVEMBER OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY WITH HER HUSBAND LEARNING THAT MISSUS DAVIS WANTED A MODISTE I PRESENTED MYSELF
6106-58195-0012 AND WAS EMPLOYED BY HER ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF ONE OF MY PATRONS AND HER INTIMATE FRIEND MISSUS CAPTAIN HETSILL I WENT TO THE HOUSE TO WORK
6106-58195-0013 AND AS I HAD TO FIT MANY DRESSES ON MISSUS DAVIS I TOLD HER THAT I SHOULD PREFER GIVING HALF THE DAY TO HER WORKING THE OTHER IN MY OWN ROOM FOR SOME OF MY OTHER LADY PATRONS MISSUS D CONSENTED TO THE PROPOSITION
6106-58195-0014 AND AS MISTER DAVIS OCCUPIED A LEADING POSITION HIS HOUSE WAS THE RESORT OF POLITICIANS AND STATESMEN FROM THE SOUTH ALMOST EVERY NIGHT AS I LEARNED FROM THE SERVANTS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY
6106-58195-0015 SECRET MEETINGS WERE HELD AT THE HOUSE AND SOME OF THESE MEETINGS WERE PROTRACTED TO A VERY LATE HOUR THE PROSPECTS OF WAR WERE FREELY DISCUSSED IN MY PRESENCE
6106-58195-0016 THE HOLIDAYS WERE APPROACHING AND MISSUS DAVIS KEPT ME BUSY IN MANUFACTURING ARTICLES OF DRESS FOR HERSELF AND CHILDREN SHE DESIRED TO PRESENT MISTER DAVIS ON CHRISTMAS
6106-58195-0017 AND FOR WEEKS THE WORK HAD BEEN UNDER WAY CHRISTMAS EVE CAME AND THE GOWN HAD BEEN LAID ASIDE SO OFTEN THAT IT WAS STILL UNFINISHED I SAW THAT MISSUS D WAS ANXIOUS TO HAVE IT COMPLETED SO I VOLUNTEERED TO REMAIN AND WORK ON IT
6106-58195-0018 WEARILY THE HOURS DRAGGED ON BUT THERE WAS NO REST FOR MY BUSY FINGERS I PERSEVERED IN MY TASK NOTWITHSTANDING MY HEAD WAS ACHING MISSUS DAVIS WAS BUSY IN THE ADJOINING ROOM
6106-58195-0019 ARRANGING THE CHRISTMAS TREE FOR THE CHILDREN I LOOKED AT THE CLOCK AND THE HANDS POINTED TO A QUARTER OF TWELVE I WAS ARRANGING THE CORDS ON THE GOWN WHEN THE SENATOR CAME IN HE LOOKED SOMEWHAT CAREWORN AND HIS STEP SEEMED TO BE A LITTLE NERVOUS
6106-58195-0020 HE LEANED AGAINST THE DOOR AND EXPRESSED HIS ADMIRATION OF THE CHRISTMAS TREE BUT THERE WAS NO SMILE ON HIS FACE TURNING ROUND HE SAW ME SITTING IN THE ADJOINING ROOM AND QUICKLY EXCLAIMED THAT YOU LIZZIE
6106-58195-0021 STILL AT WORK I HOPE THAT MISSUS DAVIS IS NOT TOO EXACTING NO SIR I ANSWERED MISSUS DAVIS WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE THIS GOWN FINISHED TO NIGHT AND I VOLUNTEERED TO REMAIN AND COMPLETE IT
6106-58195-0022 WELL WELL THE CASE MUST BE URGENT AND HE CAME SLOWLY TOWARDS ME TOOK THE GOWN IN HIS HAND AND ASKED THE COLOR OF THE SILK AS HE SAID THE GAS LIGHT WAS SO DECEPTIVE TO HIS OLD EYES
6106-58195-0023 AND MIGHT HAVE ADDED THAT IT WAS RICH AND HANDSOME BUT DID NOT WELL KNOWING THAT HE WOULD MAKE THE DISCOVERY IN THE MORNING HE SMILED CURIOUSLY BUT TURNED AND WALKED FROM THE ROOM WITHOUT ANOTHER QUESTION HE INFERRED THAT THE GOWN WAS FOR HIM
6106-58195-0024 THAT IT WAS TO BE THE CHRISTMAS PRESENT FROM HIS WIFE AND HE DID NOT WISH TO DESTROY THE PLEASURE THAT SHE WOULD EXPERIENCE
6106-58195-0025 IN THIS RESPECT AS IN MANY OTHERS HE ALWAYS APPEARED TO ME AS A THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATE MAN IN THE DOMESTIC CIRCLE AS THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE I FINISHED THE GOWN LITTLE DREAMING OF THE FUTURE THAT WAS BEFORE IT
6106-58195-0026 IT WAS WORN I HAVE NOT THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT BY MISTER DAVIS DURING THE STORMY YEARS THAT HE WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES THE HOLIDAYS PASSED AND BEFORE THE CLOSE OF JANUARY THE WAR WAS DISCUSSED IN MISTER DAVIS'S FAMILY
6106-58195-0027 AS AN EVENT CERTAIN TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE MISSUS DAVIS WAS WARMLY ATTACHED TO WASHINGTON AND I OFTEN HEARD HER SAY THAT SHE DISLIKED THE IDEA OF BREAKING UP OLD ASSOCIATIONS AND GOING SOUTH TO SUFFER FROM TROUBLE AND DEPRIVATION
6106-58195-0028 ONE DAY WHILE DISCUSSING THE QUESTION IN MY PRESENCE WITH ONE OF HER INTIMATE FRIENDS SHE EXCLAIMED I WOULD RATHER REMAIN IN WASHINGTON AND BE KICKED ABOUT THAN GO SOUTH AND BE MISSUS PRESIDENT
6106-58195-0029 WHILE DRESSING HER ONE DAY SHE SAID TO ME LIZZIE YOU ARE SO VERY HANDY THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE YOU SOUTH WITH ME WHEN DO YOU GO SOUTH MISSUS DAVIS I INQUIRED OH I CANNOT TELL JUST NOW BUT IT WILL BE SOON
6106-58195-0030 NO BUT I TELL YOU YES WHO WILL GO TO WAR I ASKED THE NORTH AND SOUTH WAS HER READY REPLY THE SOUTHERN PEOPLE WILL NOT SUBMIT TO THE HUMILIATING DEMANDS OF THE ABOLITION PARTY THEY WILL FIGHT FIRST
6106-58195-0031 THE SOUTH IS IMPULSIVE IS IN EARNEST AND THE SOUTHERN SOLDIERS WILL FIGHT TO CONQUER THE NORTH WILL YIELD WHEN IT SEES THE SOUTH IS IN EARNEST RATHER THAN ENGAGE IN A LONG AND BLOODY WAR BUT MISSUS DAVIS
6106-58195-0032 CERTAIN I KNOW IT YOU HAD BETTER GO SOUTH WITH ME I WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU BESIDES WHEN THE WAR BREAKS OUT THE COLORED PEOPLE WILL SUFFER IN THE NORTH THE NORTHERN PEOPLE WILL LOOK UPON THEM AS THE CAUSE OF THE WAR
6106-58195-0033 AND I FEAR IN THEIR EXASPERATION WILL BE INCLINED TO TREAT YOU HARSHLY THEN I MAY COME BACK TO WASHINGTON IN A FEW MONTHS AND LIVE IN THE WHITE HOUSE THE SOUTHERN PEOPLE TALK OF CHOOSING MISTER DAVIS FOR THEIR PRESIDENT
6106-58195-0034 IN FACT IT MAY BE CONSIDERED SETTLED THAT HE WILL BE THEIR PRESIDENT
6106-58195-0035 WE WILL RAISE AN ARMY AND MARCH ON WASHINGTON AND THEN I SHALL LIVE IN THE WHITE HOUSE I WAS BEWILDERED WITH WHAT I HEARD I HAD SERVED MISSUS DAVIS FAITHFULLY AND SHE HAD LEARNED TO PLACE THE GREATEST CONFIDENCE IN ME
6106-58195-0036 AT FIRST I WAS ALMOST TEMPTED TO GO SOUTH WITH HER FOR HER REASONING SEEMED PLAUSIBLE AT THE TIME THE CONVERSATION WAS CLOSED WITH MY PROMISE TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION I THOUGHT OVER THE QUESTION MUCH AND THE MORE I THOUGHT
6106-58195-0037 THE LESS INCLINED I FELT TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSITION SO KINDLY MADE BY MISSUS DAVIS I KNEW THE NORTH TO BE STRONG AND BELIEVED THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD FIGHT FOR THE FLAG THAT THEY PRETENDED TO VENERATE SO HIGHLY
6106-58195-0038 THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAD JUST EMERGED FROM A HEATED CAMPAIGN FLUSHED WITH VICTORY AND I COULD NOT THINK THAT THE HOSTS COMPOSING THE PARTY WOULD QUIETLY YIELD ALL THEY HAD GAINED IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CANVASS
6106-58195-0039 A SHOW OF WAR FROM THE SOUTH I FELT WOULD LEAD TO ACTUAL WAR IN THE NORTH AND WITH THE TWO SECTIONS BITTERLY ARRAYED AGAINST EACH OTHER I PREFERRED TO CAST MY LOT AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTH I PARTED WITH MISSUS DAVIS KINDLY
6106-58195-0040 HALF PROMISING TO JOIN HER IN THE SOUTH IF FURTHER DELIBERATION SHOULD INDUCE ME TO CHANGE MY VIEWS A FEW WEEKS BEFORE SHE LEFT WASHINGTON I MADE TWO CHINTZ WRAPPERS FOR HER SHE SAID THAT SHE MUST GIVE UP EXPENSIVE DRESSING FOR A WHILE
6106-58195-0041 NOW THAT WAR WAS IMMINENT MUST LEARN TO PRACTISE LESSONS OF ECONOMY SHE LEFT SOME FINE NEEDLE WORK IN MY HANDS WHICH I FINISHED AND FORWARDED TO HER AT MONTGOMERY ALABAMA IN THE MONTH OF JUNE THROUGH THE ASSISTANCE OF MISSUS EMORY
6106-58195-0042 ONE OF HER OLDEST AND BEST FRIENDS SINCE BIDDING THEM GOOD BY AT WASHINGTON EARLY IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTY I HAVE NEVER MET ANY OF THE DAVIS FAMILY YEARS OF EXCITEMENT YEARS OF BLOODSHED
6106-58195-0043 AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF GRAVES INTERVENE BETWEEN THE MONTHS I SPENT IN THE FAMILY AND NOW THE YEARS HAVE BROUGHT MANY CHANGES AND IN VIEW OF THESE TERRIBLE CHANGES
6106-58195-0044 WHO HAVE BEEN PUNISHED WITH THE CRUEL LASH WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE HEART AND SOUL TORTURES OF A SLAVE'S LIFE CAN SAY TO MISTER JEFFERSON DAVIS PEACE YOU HAVE SUFFERED GO IN PEACE
6106-58195-0045 IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE I WAS IN CHICAGO AND ONE DAY VISITED THE GREAT CHARITY FAIR
6106-58195-0046 HELD FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE FAMILIES OF THOSE SOLDIERS WHO WERE KILLED OR WOUNDED DURING THE WAR IN ONE PART OF THE BUILDING WAS A WAX FIGURE OF JEFFERSON DAVIS WEARING OVER HIS OTHER GARMENTS
6106-58195-0047 THERE WAS ALWAYS A GREAT CROWD AROUND THIS FIGURE AND I WAS NATURALLY ATTRACTED TOWARDS IT I WORKED MY WAY TO THE FIGURE AND IN EXAMINING THE DRESS MADE THE PLEASING DISCOVERY THAT IT WAS ONE OF THE CHINTZ WRAPPERS THAT I HAD MADE FOR MISSUS DAVIS
6106-58195-0048 A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE DEPARTED FROM WASHINGTON FOR THE SOUTH WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT I RECOGNIZED THE DRESS AS ONE THAT I HAD MADE FOR THE WIFE OF THE LATE CONFEDERATE PRESIDENT THERE WAS GREAT CHEERING AND EXCITEMENT AND I AT ONCE BECAME THE OBJECT OF THE DEEPEST CURIOSITY
6106-58195-0049 GREAT CROWDS FOLLOWED ME AND IN ORDER TO ESCAPE FROM THE EMBARRASSING SITUATION I LEFT THE BUILDING I BELIEVE IT NOW IS PRETTY WELL ESTABLISHED THAT MISTER DAVIS HAD ON A WATER PROOF CLOAK INSTEAD OF A DRESS AS FIRST REPORTED
6106-58195-0050 WHEN HE WAS CAPTURED THIS DOES NOT INVALIDATE ANY PORTION OF MY STORY THE DRESS ON THE WAX FIGURE AT THE FAIR IN CHICAGO UNQUESTIONABLY WAS ONE OF THE CHINTZ WRAPPERS THAT I MADE FOR MISSUS DAVIS IN JANUARY EIGHTEEN SIXTY IN WASHINGTON
6106-58195-0051 AND I INFER SINCE IT WAS NOT FOUND ON THE BODY OF THE FUGITIVE PRESIDENT OF THE SOUTH IT WAS TAKEN FROM THE TRUNKS OF MISSUS DAVIS CAPTURED AT THE SAME TIME
