4133-6541-0000 IMMENSE BLISTERS ON EVERY FINGER GIVING THEM THE APPEARANCE OF SAUSAGES TO NIGHT PONTING HAS PHOTOGRAPHED THE HAND AS I EXPECTED SOME AMENDMENT OF ATKINSON'S TALE AS WRITTEN LAST NIGHT IS NECESSARY
4133-6541-0001 PARTLY DUE TO SOME LACK OF COHERENCY IN THE TALE AS FIRST TOLD AND PARTLY A RECONSIDERATION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES BY ATKINSON HIMSELF
4133-6541-0002 IT APPEARS HE FIRST HIT INACCESSIBLE ISLAND AND GOT HIS HAND FROSTBITTEN BEFORE HE REACHED IT IT WAS ONLY ON ARRIVAL IN ITS LEE THAT HE DISCOVERED THE FROSTBITE
4133-6541-0003 HE MUST HAVE WAITED THERE SOME TIME THEN GROPED HIS WAY TO THE WESTERN END THINKING HE WAS NEAR THE RAMP THEN WANDERING AWAY IN A SWIRL OF DRIFT TO CLEAR SOME IRREGULARITIES AT THE ICE FOOT
4133-6541-0004 HE COMPLETELY LOST THE ISLAND WHEN HE COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN A FEW YARDS FROM IT HE SEEMS IN THIS PREDICAMENT TO HAVE CLUNG TO THE OLD IDEA OF WALKING UP WIND AND IT MUST BE CONSIDERED WHOLLY PROVIDENTIAL THAT ON THIS COURSE
4133-6541-0005 HE NEXT STRUCK TENT ISLAND IT WAS ROUND THIS ISLAND THAT HE WALKED FINALLY DIGGING HIMSELF A SHELTER ON ITS LEE SIDE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS INACCESSIBLE ISLAND
4133-6541-0006 WHEN THE MOON APPEARED HE SEEMS TO HAVE JUDGED ITS BEARING WELL AND AS HE TRAVELLED HOMEWARD HE WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO SEE THE REAL INACCESSIBLE ISLAND APPEAR ON HIS LEFT THE DISTANCE OF TENT ISLAND
4133-6541-0007 FOUR TO FIVE MILES PARTLY ACCOUNTS FOR THE TIME HE TOOK IN RETURNING EVERYTHING GOES TO CONFIRM THE FACT THAT HE HAD A VERY CLOSE SHAVE OF BEING LOST ALTOGETHER
4133-6541-0008 FOR SOME TIME PAST SOME OF THE PONIES HAVE HAD GREAT IRRITATION OF THE SKIN I FELT SURE IT WAS DUE TO SOME PARASITE
4133-6541-0009 THOUGHT THE FOOD RESPONSIBLE AND CHANGED IT TO DAY A TINY BODY LOUSE WAS REVEALED UNDER ATKINSON'S MICROSCOPE AFTER CAPTURE FROM SNATCHER'S COAT
4133-6541-0010 A DILUTE SOLUTION OF CARBOLIC IS EXPECTED TO RID THE POOR BEASTS OF THEIR PESTS BUT MEANWHILE ONE OR TWO OF THEM HAVE RUBBED OFF PATCHES OF HAIR WHICH THEY CAN ILL AFFORD TO SPARE IN THIS CLIMATE
4133-6541-0011 I HOPE WE SHALL GET OVER THE TROUBLE QUICKLY THE DAY HAS BEEN GLORIOUSLY FINE AGAIN WITH BRIGHT MOONLIGHT ALL THE AFTERNOON IT WAS A WONDROUS SIGHT TO SEE EREBUS
4133-6541-0012 EMERGE FROM SOFT FILMY CLOUDS OF MIST AS THOUGH SOME THIN VEILING HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN WITH INFINITE DELICACY TO REVEAL THE PURE OUTLINE OF THIS MOONLIT MOUNTAIN THURSDAY JULY SIX
4133-6541-0013 CONTINUED THE TEMPERATURE HAS TAKEN A PLUNGE
4133-6541-0014 WITH A TEN MILE BREEZE FROM THE SOUTH FROSTBITING WEATHER
4133-6541-0015 THE SURFACE IS BAD AFTER THE RECENT SNOWFALL A NEW PAIR OF SEALSKIN OVERSHOES FOR SKI MADE BY EVANS SEEM TO BE A COMPLETE SUCCESS HE HAS MODIFIED THE SHAPE OF THE TOE TO FIT THE SKI IRONS BETTER
4133-6541-0016 I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT I FIND IT EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TO SETTLE DOWN TO SOLID WORK JUST AT PRESENT AND KEEP PUTTING OFF THE TASKS WHICH I HAVE SET MYSELF
4133-6541-0017 THE SUN HAS NOT YET RISEN A DEGREE OF THE ELEVEN DEGREES BELOW OUR HORIZON WHICH IT WAS AT NOON ON MIDWINTER DAY AND YET TO DAY THERE WAS A DISTINCT RED IN THE NORTHERN SKY
4133-6541-0018 OUR RECORD SO FAR AND LIKELY TO REMAIN SO ONE WOULD THINK THIS MORNING IT WAS FINE AND CALM
4133-6541-0019 NEVER PASSING ABOVE THAT POINT I THOUGHT IT A LITTLE TOO STRENUOUS AND SO WAS ROBBED OF MY WALK THE DOGS COATS ARE GETTING PRETTY THICK AND THEY SEEM TO TAKE MATTERS PRETTY COMFORTABLY THE PONIES ARE BETTER I THINK
4133-6541-0020 BUT I SHALL BE GLAD WHEN WE ARE SURE OF HAVING RID THEM OF THEIR PEST I WAS THE VICTIM OF A VERY CURIOUS ILLUSION TO DAY ON OUR SMALL HEATING STOVE STANDS A CYLINDRICAL ICE MELTER WHICH KEEPS UP THE SUPPLY OF WATER
4133-6541-0021 NECESSARY FOR THE DARK ROOM AND OTHER SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS THIS IRON CONTAINER NATURALLY BECOMES WARM IF IT IS NOT FED WITH ICE AND IT IS GENERALLY HUNG AROUND WITH SOCKS AND MITS WHICH REQUIRE DRYING
4133-6541-0022 I PUT MY HAND ON THE CYLINDRICAL VESSEL THIS AFTERNOON AND WITHDREW IT SHARPLY WITH THE SENSATION OF HEAT TO VERIFY THE IMPRESSION I REPEATED THE ACTION TWO OR THREE TIMES
4133-6541-0023 OF THE PERIL OF BURNING TO WHICH THEY WERE EXPOSED UPON THIS MEARES SAID BUT THEY FILLED THE MELTER WITH ICE A FEW MINUTES AGO AND THEN COMING OVER TO FEEL THE SURFACE HIMSELF ADDED WHY IT'S COLD SIR
4133-6541-0024 AND INDEED SO IT WAS THE SLIGHTLY DAMP CHILLED SURFACE OF THE IRON HAD CONVEYED TO ME THE IMPRESSION OF EXCESSIVE HEAT THERE IS NOTHING INTRINSICALLY NEW IN THIS OBSERVATION
4133-6541-0025 IT HAS OFTEN BEEN NOTICED THAT METAL SURFACES AT LOW TEMPERATURES GIVE A SENSATION OF BURNING TO THE BARE TOUCH BUT NONE THE LESS IT IS AN INTERESTING VARIANT OF THE COMMON FACT APROPOS
4133-6541-0026 ATKINSON IS SUFFERING A GOOD DEAL FROM HIS HAND THE FROSTBITE WAS DEEPER THAN I THOUGHT FORTUNATELY HE CAN NOW FEEL ALL HIS FINGERS THOUGH IT WAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE SENSATION RETURNED TO ONE OF THEM
4133-6541-0027 MONDAY
4133-6541-0028 WE HAVE HAD THE WORST GALE I HAVE EVER KNOWN IN THESE REGIONS AND HAVE NOT YET DONE WITH IT THE WIND STARTED AT ABOUT MID DAY ON FRIDAY AND INCREASING IN VIOLENCE REACHED AN AVERAGE OF SIXTY MILES FOR ONE HOUR ON SATURDAY
4133-6541-0029 HAS NOT BEEN WITHOUT PARALLEL EARLIER IN THE YEAR BUT THE EXTRAORDINARY FEATURE OF THIS GALE WAS THE LONG CONTINUANCE OF A VERY COLD TEMPERATURE
4133-6541-0030 LATE YESTERDAY IT WAS IN THE MINUS TWENTIES
4133-6541-0031 I HAD LITERALLY TO LEAN AGAINST THE WIND WITH HEAD BENT AND FACE AVERTED AND SO STAGGER CRAB LIKE ON MY COURSE IN THOSE TWO DAYS OF REALLY TERRIBLE WEATHER OUR THOUGHTS OFTEN TURNED TO ABSENTEES AT CAPE CROZIER
4133-6541-0032 WITH THE DEVOUT HOPE THAT THEY MAY BE SAFELY HOUSED THEY ARE CERTAIN TO HAVE BEEN CAUGHT BY THIS GALE BUT I TRUST BEFORE IT REACHED THEM THEY HAD MANAGED TO GET UP SOME SORT OF SHELTER
4133-6541-0033 SOMETIMES I HAVE IMAGINED THEM GETTING MUCH MORE WIND THAN WE DO YET AT OTHERS IT SEEMS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE EMPEROR PENGUINS HAVE CHOSEN AN EXCESSIVELY WIND SWEPT AREA FOR THEIR ROOKERY
4133-6541-0034 TO DAY WITH THE TEMPERATURE AT ZERO ONE CAN WALK ABOUT OUTSIDE WITHOUT INCONVENIENCE IN SPITE OF A FIFTY MILE WIND ALTHOUGH I AM LOATH TO BELIEVE IT THERE MUST BE SOME MEASURE OF ACCLIMATISATION
4133-6541-0035 TUESDAY
4133-6541-0036 NEVER WAS SUCH PERSISTENT BAD WEATHER
4133-6541-0037 AND THE MOON A VAGUE BLUE THIS IS THE FOURTH DAY OF GALE IF ONE REFLECTS ON THE QUANTITY OF TRANSPORTED AIR NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND MILES
4133-6541-0038 ONE GETS A CONCEPTION OF THE TRANSFERENCE WHICH SUCH A GALE EFFECTS AND MUST CONCLUDE THAT POTENTIALLY WARM UPPER CURRENTS ARE POURING INTO OUR POLAR AREA FROM MORE TEMPERATE SOURCES THE DOGS ARE VERY GAY AND HAPPY IN THE COMPARATIVE WARMTH
4133-6541-0039 I HAVE BEEN GOING TO AND FRO ON THE HOME BEACH AND ABOUT THE ROCKY KNOLLS IN ITS ENVIRONMENT IN SPITE OF THE WIND IT WAS VERY WARM I DUG MYSELF A HOLE IN A DRIFT IN THE SHELTER OF A LARGE BOULDER AND LAY DOWN IN IT
4133-6541-0040 AND COVERED MY LEGS WITH LOOSE SNOW IT WAS SO WARM THAT I COULD HAVE SLEPT VERY COMFORTABLY I HAVE BEEN AMUSED AND PLEASED LATELY IN OBSERVING THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE PERSONS IN CHARGE OF OUR STORES
4133-6541-0041 QUITE A NUMBER OF SECRET CACHES EXIST IN WHICH ARTICLES OF VALUE ARE HIDDEN FROM PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE SO THAT THEY MAY ESCAPE USE UNTIL A REAL NECESSITY ARISES
4133-6541-0042 THE POLICY OF EVERY STOREKEEPER IS TO HAVE SOMETHING UP HIS SLEEVE FOR A RAINY DAY FOR INSTANCE EVANS P O AFTER THOROUGHLY EXAMINING THE PURPOSE OF SOME INDIVIDUAL WHO IS PLEADING FOR A PIECE OF CANVAS
4133-6541-0043 WILL ADMIT THAT HE MAY HAVE A SMALL PIECE SOMEWHERE WHICH COULD BE USED FOR IT WHEN AS A MATTER OF FACT HE POSSESSES QUITE A NUMBER OF ROLLS OF THAT MATERIAL TOOLS METAL MATERIAL LEATHER
4133-6541-0044 STRAPS AND DOZENS OF ITEMS ARE ADMINISTERED WITH THE SAME SPIRIT OF JEALOUS GUARDIANSHIP BY DAY LASHLY OATES AND MEARES WHILE OUR MAIN STOREKEEPER BOWERS EVEN AFFECTS TO BEMOAN IMAGINARY SHORTAGES
4133-6541-0045 ALL NIGHT AND TO DAY WILD GUSTS OF WIND SHAKING THE HUT LONG RAGGED TWISTED WIND CLOUD IN THE MIDDLE HEIGHTS A WATERY MOON SHINING THROUGH A FILMY CIRROSTRATUS
4133-6541-0046 THE OUTLOOK WONDERFULLY DESOLATE WITH ITS GHOSTLY ILLUMINATION AND PATCHY CLOUDS OF FLYING SNOW DRIFT IT WOULD BE HARDLY POSSIBLE FOR A TEARING RAGING WIND TO MAKE ITSELF MORE VISIBLE
4133-6541-0047 AT WIND VANE HILL THE ANEMOMETER HAS REGISTERED SIXTY EIGHT MILES BETWEEN NINE AND TEN A M A RECORD
4133-6541-0048 THURSDAY
4133-6541-0049 THE WIND CONTINUED TO BLOW THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT WITH SQUALLS OF EVEN GREATER VIOLENCE THAN BEFORE
4133-6541-0050 THE SNOW IS SO HARD BLOWN THAT ONLY THE FIERCEST GUSTS RAISE THE DRIFTING PARTICLES IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THE BALANCE OF NATURE WHEREBY ONE EVIL IS ELIMINATED BY THE EXCESS OF ANOTHER
4133-6541-0051 FOR AN HOUR AFTER LUNCH YESTERDAY THE GALE SHOWED SIGNS OF MODERATION AND THE PONIES HAD A SHORT WALK OVER THE FLOE OUT FOR EXERCISE AT THIS TIME I WAS OBLIGED TO LEAN AGAINST THE WIND
4133-6541-0052 MY LIGHT OVERALL CLOTHES FLAPPING WILDLY AND ALMOST DRAGGED FROM ME LATER WHEN THE WIND ROSE AGAIN IT WAS QUITE AN EFFORT TO STAGGER BACK TO THE HUT AGAINST IT THIS MORNING THE GALE STILL RAGES
4133-6541-0053 BUT THE SKY IS MUCH CLEARER THE ONLY DEFINITE CLOUDS ARE THOSE WHICH HANG TO THE SOUTHWARD OF EREBUS SUMMIT BUT THE MOON THOUGH BRIGHT STILL EXHIBITS A WATERY APPEARANCE
4133-6541-0054 SHOWING THAT THERE IS STILL A THIN STRATUS ABOVE US THE WORK GOES ON VERY STEADILY THE MEN ARE MAKING CRAMPONS AND SKI BOOTS OF THE NEW STYLE EVANS IS CONSTRUCTING PLANS OF THE DRY VALLEY
4133-6541-0055 AND KOETTLITZ GLACIER WITH THE HELP OF THE WESTERN PARTY THE PHYSICISTS ARE BUSY ALWAYS
4133-6541-0056 OATES RIDDING THE PONIES OF THEIR PARASITES AND PONTING PRINTING FROM HIS NEGATIVES SCIENCE CANNOT BE SERVED BY DILETTANTE METHODS BUT DEMANDS A MIND SPURRED BY AMBITION OR THE SATISFACTION OF IDEALS
4133-6541-0057 OUR MOST POPULAR GAME FOR EVENING RECREATION IS CHESS SO MANY PLAYERS HAVE DEVELOPED THAT OUR TWO SETS OF CHESSMEN ARE INADEQUATE FRIDAY
4133-6541-0058 WE HAVE HAD A HORRIBLE FRIGHT AND ARE NOT YET OUT OF THE WOOD AT NOON YESTERDAY ONE OF THE BEST PONIES BONES SUDDENLY WENT OFF HIS FEED
4133-6541-0059 SOON AFTER IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS DISTRESSED AND THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT HE WAS SUFFERING FROM COLIC OATES CALLED MY ATTENTION TO IT BUT WE WERE NEITHER MUCH ALARMED REMEMBERING THE SPEEDY RECOVERY OF JIMMY PIGG
4133-6541-0060 UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES LATER THE PONY WAS SENT OUT FOR EXERCISE WITH CREAN I PASSED HIM TWICE AND SEEMED TO GATHER THAT THINGS WERE WELL BUT CREAN AFTERWARDS TOLD ME THAT HE HAD HAD CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE
4133-6541-0061 EVERY FEW MINUTES THE POOR BEAST HAD BEEN SEIZED WITH A SPASM OF PAIN HAD FIRST DASHED FORWARD AS THOUGH TO ESCAPE IT AND THEN ENDEAVOURED TO LIE DOWN
4133-6541-0062 AND ON HIS LEGS FOR HE IS A POWERFUL BEAST WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE STABLE HE WAS EVIDENTLY WORSE AND OATES AND ANTON PATIENTLY DRAGGED A SACK TO AND FRO UNDER HIS STOMACH EVERY NOW AND AGAIN
4133-6541-0063 HE ATTEMPTED TO LIE DOWN AND OATES EVENTUALLY THOUGHT IT WISER TO LET HIM DO SO ONCE DOWN HIS HEAD GRADUALLY DROOPED UNTIL HE LAY AT LENGTH EVERY NOW AND AGAIN TWITCHING VERY HORRIBLY WITH THE PAIN
4133-6541-0064 AND FROM TIME TO TIME RAISING HIS HEAD AND EVEN SCRAMBLING TO HIS LEGS WHEN IT GREW INTENSE I DON'T THINK I EVER REALISED BEFORE HOW PATHETIC A HORSE COULD BE UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS NO SOUND ESCAPES HIM
4133-6541-0065 HIS MISERY CAN ONLY BE INDICATED BY THOSE DISTRESSING SPASMS AND BY DUMB MOVEMENTS OF THE HEAD TURNED WITH A PATIENT EXPRESSION ALWAYS SUGGESTIVE OF APPEAL
4133-6541-0066 REMEMBERING THE CARE WITH WHICH THE ANIMALS ARE BEING FED I COULD NOT PICTURE ANYTHING BUT A PASSING INDISPOSITION BUT AS HOUR AFTER HOUR PASSED WITHOUT IMPROVEMENT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO REALISE THAT THE POOR BEAST WAS DANGEROUSLY ILL
4133-6541-0067 OATES ADMINISTERED AN OPIUM PILL AND LATER ON A SECOND SACKS WERE HEATED IN THE OVEN AND PLACED ON THE POOR BEAST BEYOND THIS NOTHING COULD BE DONE EXCEPT TO WATCH OATES AND CREAN
4133-6541-0068 NEVER LEFT THE PATIENT AS THE EVENING WORE ON I VISITED THE STABLE AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT ONLY TO HEAR THE SAME TALE NO IMPROVEMENT TOWARDS MIDNIGHT I FELT VERY DOWNCAST
4133-6541-0069 IT IS SO VERY CERTAIN THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE A SINGLE PONY THE MARGIN OF SAFETY HAS ALREADY BEEN FAR OVERSTEPPED WE ARE REDUCED TO FACE THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WE MUST KEEP ALL THE ANIMALS ALIVE
4133-6541-0070 OR GREATLY RISK FAILURE SO FAR EVERYTHING HAS GONE SO WELL WITH THEM THAT MY FEARS OF A LOSS HAD BEEN LULLED IN A GROWING HOPE THAT ALL WOULD BE WELL THEREFORE AT MIDNIGHT WHEN POOR BONES
4133-6541-0071 HAD CONTINUED IN PAIN FOR TWELVE HOURS AND SHOWED LITTLE SIGN OF IMPROVEMENT I FELT MY FLEETING SENSE OF SECURITY RUDELY SHATTERED IT WAS SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT WHEN I WAS TOLD THAT THE ANIMAL SEEMED A LITTLE EASIER
4133-6541-0072 THE HORSE STILL LAY ON ITS SIDE WITH OUTSTRETCHED HEAD BUT THE SPASMS HAD CEASED ITS EYE LOOKED LESS DISTRESSED AND ITS EARS PRICKED TO OCCASIONAL NOISES
4133-6541-0073 AS I STOOD LOOKING IT SUDDENLY RAISED ITS HEAD AND ROSE WITHOUT EFFORT TO ITS LEGS THEN IN A MOMENT AS THOUGH SOME BAD DREAM HAD PASSED IT BEGAN TO NOSE AT SOME HAY AND AT ITS NEIGHBOUR
4133-6541-0074 WITHIN THREE MINUTES IT HAD DRUNK A BUCKET OF WATER AND HAD STARTED TO FEED I WENT TO BED AT THREE WITH MUCH RELIEF AT NOON TO DAY THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE
4133-6541-0075 AND AN INDICATION THAT THERE IS STILL RISK WERE DISCLOSED IN A SMALL BALL OF SEMI FERMENTED HAY COVERED WITH MUCUS AND CONTAINING TAPE WORMS SO FAR NOT VERY SERIOUS
4133-6541-0076 BUT UNFORTUNATELY ATTACHED TO THIS MASS WAS A STRIP OF THE LINING OF THE INTESTINE ATKINSON FROM A HUMANLY COMPARATIVE POINT OF VIEW DOES NOT THINK THIS IS SERIOUS IF GREAT CARE IS TAKEN WITH THE FOOD FOR A WEEK OR SO
4133-6541-0077 AND SO ONE CAN HOPE FOR THE BEST MEANWHILE WE HAVE HAD MUCH DISCUSSION AS TO THE FIRST CAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY THE CIRCUMSTANCES POSSIBLY CONTRIBUTING ARE AS FOLLOWS FERMENTATION OF THE HAY
4133-6541-0078 INSUFFICIENCY OF WATER OVERHEATED STABLE A CHILL FROM EXERCISE AFTER THE GALE
4133-6541-0079 IT CAN SCARCELY BE COINCIDENCE THAT THE TWO PONIES WHICH HAVE SUFFERED SO FAR ARE THOSE WHICH ARE NEAREST THE STOVE END OF THE STABLE IN FUTURE THE STOVE WILL BE USED MORE SPARINGLY
4133-6541-0080 A LARGE VENTILATING HOLE IS TO BE MADE NEAR IT AND AN ALLOWANCE OF WATER IS TO BE ADDED TO THE SNOW HITHERTO GIVEN TO THE ANIMALS IN THE FOOD LINE WE CAN ONLY EXERCISE SUCH PRECAUTIONS AS ARE POSSIBLE
4133-6541-0081 BUT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT ANY MORE DANGER OF THIS DESCRIPTION SATURDAY
4133-6541-0082 THERE WAS STRONG WIND WITH SNOW THIS MORNING AND THE WIND REMAINED KEEN AND COLD IN THE AFTERNOON BUT TO NIGHT IT HAS FALLEN CALM WITH A PROMISING CLEAR SKY OUTLOOK HAVE BEEN UP THE RAMP
4133-6541-0083 CLAMBERING ABOUT IN MY SEALSKIN OVERSHOES WHICH SEEM EXTRAORDINARILY SATISFACTORY OATES THINKS A GOOD FEW OF THE PONIES HAVE GOT WORMS AND WE ARE CONSIDERING MEANS OF RIDDING THEM BONES SEEMS TO BE GETTING ON WELL
4133-6541-0084 THOUGH NOT YET QUITE SO BUCKISH AS HE WAS BEFORE HIS TROUBLE A GOOD BIG VENTILATOR HAS BEEN FITTED IN THE STABLE IT IS NOT EASY TO GET OVER THE ALARM OF THURSDAY NIGHT THE SITUATION IS ALTOGETHER TOO CRITICAL
4133-6541-0085 SUNDAY
4133-6541-0086 ANOTHER SLIGHT ALARM THIS MORNING THE PONY CHINA WENT OFF HIS FEED AT BREAKFAST TIME AND LAY DOWN TWICE HE WAS UP AND WELL AGAIN IN HALF AN HOUR BUT WHAT ON EARTH IS IT THAT IS DISTURBING THESE POOR BEASTS
4133-6541-0087 USUAL SUNDAY ROUTINE QUIET DAY EXCEPT FOR A GOOD DEAL OF WIND OFF AND ON THE CROZIER PARTY MUST BE HAVING A WRETCHED TIME MONDAY
4133-6541-0088 THE WEATHER STILL VERY UNSETTLED THE WIND COMES UP WITH A RUSH TO FADE IN AN HOUR OR TWO CLOUDS CHASE OVER THE SKY IN SIMILAR FASHION THE MOON HAS DIPPED DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS
4133-6541-0089 AND SO ONE WAY AND ANOTHER THERE IS LITTLE TO ATTRACT ONE OUT OF DOORS YET WE ARE ONLY NINE DAYS OFF THE LIGHT VALUE OF THE DAY WHEN WE LEFT OFF FOOTBALL I HOPE WE SHALL BE ABLE TO RECOMMENCE THE GAME IN THAT TIME
4133-6541-0090 I AM GLAD THAT THE LIGHT IS COMING FOR MORE THAN ONE REASON THE GALE AND CONSEQUENT INACTION NOT ONLY AFFECTED THE PONIES PONTING IS NOT VERY FIT AS A CONSEQUENCE
4133-6541-0091 HIS NERVOUS TEMPERAMENT IS OF THE QUALITY TO TAKE THIS WINTERING EXPERIENCE BADLY ATKINSON HAS SOME DIFFICULTY IN PERSUADING HIM TO TAKE EXERCISE HE MANAGED ONLY BY DRAGGING HIM OUT TO HIS OWN WORK DIGGING HOLES IN THE ICE
4133-6541-0092 TAYLOR IS ANOTHER BACKSLIDER IN THE EXERCISE LINE AND IS NOT LOOKING WELL IF WE CAN GET THESE PEOPLE TO RUN ABOUT AT FOOTBALL ALL WILL BE WELL ANYWAY THE RETURN OF THE LIGHT SHOULD CURE ALL AILMENTS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL
4133-6541-0093 TUESDAY
4133-6541-0094 VERY BRILLIANT RED SKY AT NOON TO DAY AND ENOUGH LIGHT TO SEE ONE'S WAY ABOUT THIS FLEETING HOUR OF LIGHT IS VERY PLEASANT BUT OF COURSE DEPENDENT ON A CLEAR SKY VERY RARE
4133-6541-0095 WENT ROUND THE OUTER BERG IN THE AFTERNOON IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO KEEP UP WITH SNATCHER ON THE HOMEWARD ROUND SPEAKING WELL FOR HIS WALKING POWERS WEDNESDAY
4133-6541-0096 AGAIN CALM AND PLEASANT
4133-6541-0097 WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT NEAR HERE BEFORE THE GALE THE COURSE OF EVENTS IS NOT VERY CLEAR BUT IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE GALE PRESSED UP THE CRACK RAISING BROKEN PIECES OF THE THIN ICE FORMED AFTER RECENT OPENING MOVEMENTS
4133-6541-0098 THESE RAISED PIECES HAD BECOME NUCLEI OF HEAVY SNOW DRIFTS WHICH IN TURN WEIGHING DOWN THE FLOE HAD ALLOWED WATER TO FLOW IN OVER THE SLEDGE LEVEL
4133-6541-0099 IT IS SURPRISING TO FIND SUCH A BIG DISTURBANCE FROM WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SIMPLE CAUSE THIS CRACK IS NOW JOINED
4133-6541-0100 WE HAVE NOTICED A VERY CURIOUS APPEARANCE OF HEAVENLY BODIES WHEN SETTING IN A NORTH WESTERLY DIRECTION ABOUT THE TIME OF MIDWINTER THE MOON OBSERVED IN THIS POSITION
4133-6541-0101 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A RED FLARE OR DISTANT BONFIRE BUT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN GUESSED FOR THE MOON YESTERDAY THE PLANET VENUS APPEARED UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES AS A SHIP'S SIDE LIGHT OR JAPANESE LANTERN
4133-6541-0102 BUT THE LATTER WAS DOMINANT THURSDAY JULY TWENTY FRIDAY TWENTY ONE SATURDAY
4133-6541-0103 THERE IS VERY LITTLE TO RECORD THE HORSES ARE GOING ON WELL ALL ARE IN GOOD FORM AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT THEY DRINK A GOOD DEAL OF WATER IN THE MORNING SATURDAY JULY TWENTY TWO
4133-6541-0104 CONTINUED THIS AND THE BETTER VENTILATION OF THE STABLE MAKE FOR IMPROVEMENT WE THINK PERHAPS THE INCREASE OF SALT ALLOWANCE IS ALSO BENEFICIAL TO DAY WE HAVE ANOTHER RAGING BLIZZARD
4133-6541-0105 ONE WAY AND ANOTHER THE CROZIER PARTY MUST HAVE HAD A PRETTY POOR TIME
4133-6541-0106 I AM THANKFUL TO REMEMBER THAT THE LIGHT WILL BE COMING ON APACE NOW MONDAY
4133-6541-0107 THE BLIZZARD CONTINUED THROUGHOUT YESTERDAY SUNDAY
4133-6541-0108 SIMPSON FINDS THE HILL READINGS TWENTY PER CENT HIGHER
4133-6541-0109 TO DAY NELSON FOUND THAT HIS SOUNDING SLEDGE HAD BEEN TURNED OVER WE PASSED A QUIET SUNDAY WITH THE USUAL SERVICE TO BREAK THE WEEK DAY ROUTINE DURING MY NIGHT WATCH LAST NIGHT
4133-6541-0110 I COULD OBSERVE THE RAPID FALLING OF THE WIND WHICH ON DYING AWAY
4133-6541-0111 THE TEMPERATURE HAS REMAINED COMPARATIVELY HIGH TO DAY I WENT TO SEE THE CRACK AT WHICH SOUNDINGS WERE TAKEN A WEEK AGO THEN IT WAS SEVERAL FEET OPEN WITH THIN ICE BETWEEN NOW IT IS PRESSED UP INTO A SHARP RIDGE
4133-6541-0112 THREE TO FOUR FEET HIGH THE EDGE PRESSED UP SHOWS AN EIGHTEEN INCH THICKNESS THIS IS OF COURSE AN EFFECT OF THE WARM WEATHER TUESDAY JULY TWENTY FIVE WEDNESDAY
4133-6541-0113 THERE IS REALLY VERY LITTLE TO BE RECORDED IN THESE DAYS LIFE PROCEEDS VERY CALMLY IF SOMEWHAT MONOTONOUSLY EVERYONE SEEMS FIT THERE IS NO SIGN OF DEPRESSION
4133-6541-0114 TO ALL OUTWARD APPEARANCE THE PONIES ARE IN BETTER FORM THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF THE DOGS WITH ONE OR TWO EXCEPTIONS THE LIGHT COMES ON APACE TO DAY WEDNESDAY
4133-6541-0115 IT WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL AT NOON THE AIR WAS VERY CLEAR AND THE DETAIL OF THE WESTERN MOUNTAINS WAS REVEALED IN INFINITELY DELICATE CONTRASTS OF LIGHT THURSDAY JULY TWENTY SEVEN
4133-6541-0116 CALMER DAYS THE SKY ROSIER THE LIGHT VISIBLY ADVANCING WE HAVE NEVER SUFFERED FROM LOW SPIRITS SO THAT THE PRESENCE OF DAY RAISES US ABOVE A NORMAL CHEERFULNESS TO THE REALM OF HIGH SPIRITS
4133-6541-0117 THE LIGHT MERRY HUMOUR OF OUR COMPANY HAS NEVER BEEN ECLIPSED THE GOOD NATURED KINDLY CHAFF HAS NEVER CEASED SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS OF ENTHUSIASM WHICH INSPIRED THEM
4133-6541-0118 THEY HAVE SURVIVED THE WINTER DAYS OF STRESS AND ALREADY RENEW THEMSELVES WITH THE COMING OF SPRING IF PESSIMISTIC MOMENTS HAD FORESEEN THE GROWTH OF RIFTS IN THE BOND FORGED BY THESE AMENITIES
4133-6541-0119 THEY STAND PROPHETICALLY FALSIFIED THERE IS NO LONGER ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT WE SHALL COME TO OUR WORK WITH A UNITY OF PURPOSE AND A DISPOSITION FOR MUTUAL SUPPORT
4133-6541-0120 SUCH A SPIRIT SHOULD TIDE US OVER ALL MINOR DIFFICULTIES
