8190-284434-0000 OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YEARS PILES OF GOLD AND JEWELS WERE ON ALL SIDES AND PRECIOUS ORNAMENTS AND SPLENDID CLOTHS RARE PIECES OF CARVED FURNITURE VASES BRIC A BRAC AND THE LIKE WERE STREWN ABOUT THE ROOM IN ASTONISHING PROFUSION
8190-284434-0001 JUST AT THE BOY'S FEET CROUCHED A MONSTROUS ANIMAL OF MOST FEARFUL ASPECT
8190-284434-0002 AND ITS WIDE JAWS WERE ARMED WITH ROWS OF LONG POINTED TEETH ITS SHOULDERS AND FRONT LEGS WERE HUGE AND POWERFUL BUT THE REST OF THE WOLF'S BODY DWINDLED AWAY UNTIL AT THE TAIL IT WAS NO BIGGER THAN A DOG THE JAWS WERE THEREFORE THE DANGEROUS PART OF THE CREATURE
8190-284434-0003 AND ITS SMALL BLUE EYES FLASHED WICKEDLY AT THE INTRUDER JUST AS THE BOY MADE HIS FIRST STEP FORWARD THE BLUE WOLF SPRANG UPON HIM WITH ITS ENORMOUS JAWS STRETCHED WIDE OPEN BUTTON BRIGHT JAMMED THE SOFA PILLOW INTO THE BRUTE'S MOUTH AND CROWDED IT IN AS HARD AS HE COULD
8190-284434-0004 THE TERRIBLE TEETH CAME TOGETHER AND BURIED THEMSELVES IN THE PILLOW AND THEN MISTER WOLF FOUND HE COULD NOT PULL THEM OUT AGAIN BECAUSE HIS MOUTH WAS STUFFED FULL HE COULD NOT EVEN GROWL OR YELP
8190-284434-0005 BUT ROLLED UPON THE FLOOR TRYING IN VAIN TO RELEASE HIMSELF FROM THE CONQUERING PILLOW BUTTON BRIGHT PAID NO FURTHER ATTENTION TO THE HELPLESS ANIMAL BUT CAUGHT UP THE BLUE BRASS LAMP AND BEGAN A SEARCH FOR HIS UMBRELLA OF COURSE HE COULD NOT FIND IT AS IT WAS NOT THERE
8190-284434-0006 HE CAME ACROSS A SMALL BOOK BOUND IN LIGHT BLUE LEATHER WHICH LAY UPON AN EXQUISITELY CARVED CENTER TABLE IT WAS NAMED IN DARK BLUE LETTERS STAMPED ON THE LEATHER THE ROYAL RECORD BOOK AND REMEMBERING THAT GHIP GHISIZZLE LONGED TO POSSESS THIS BOOK
8190-284434-0007 BUTTON BRIGHT HASTILY CONCEALED IT INSIDE HIS BLOUSE THEN HE RENEWED HIS SEARCH FOR THE UMBRELLA BUT IT WAS QUITE IN VAIN HE HUNTED IN EVERY CRACK AND CORNER TUMBLING THE TREASURES HERE AND THERE IN THE QUEST
8190-284434-0008 BUT AT LAST HE BECAME POSITIVE THAT THE MAGIC UMBRELLA HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE ROOM THE BOY WAS BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT
8190-284434-0009 SO THERE BEING NO OBJECT IN HIS REMAINING LONGER IN THE ROOM WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE TO FIGHT THE WOLF AGAIN BUTTON BRIGHT WENT OUT AND LOCKED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM WHILE HE STOOD IN THE CORRIDOR WONDERING WHAT TO DO NEXT A SUDDEN SHOUTING REACHED HIS EARS IT WAS THE VOICE OF THE BOOLOOROO CRYING
8190-284434-0010 AND THEN THERE FOLLOWED SHOUTS OF SOLDIERS AND GUARDS AND SERVANTS AND THE RAPID PATTERING OF FEET WAS HEARD THROUGHOUT THE PALACE
8190-284434-0011 WHERE THE SAILORMAN AND TROT WERE ANXIOUSLY AWAITING HIM QUICK CRIED THE BOY
8190-284434-0012 WHERE'S THE UMBREL ASKED CAP'N BILL I DON'T KNOW I CAN'T FIND IT BUT ALL THE PALACE IS AROUSED AND THE BOOLOOROO IS FURIOUS COME LET'S GET AWAY AT ONCE WHERE'LL WE GO INQUIRED TROT WE MUST MAKE FOR THE OPEN COUNTRY AND HIDE IN THE FOG BANK OR IN THE ARCH OF PHINIS REPLIED THE BOY
8190-284434-0013 THEY DID NOT STOP TO ARGUE ANY LONGER BUT ALL THREE STEPPED OUT OF THE LITTLE DOOR INTO THE STREET WHERE THEY FIRST CLASPED HANDS SO THEY WOULD NOT GET SEPARATED IN THE DARK AND THEN RAN AS SWIFTLY AS THEY COULD DOWN THE STREET WHICH WAS DESERTED AT THIS HOUR BY THE CITIZENS
8190-284434-0014 THEY COULD NOT GO VERY FAST BECAUSE THE SAILORMAN'S WOODEN LEG WAS AWKWARD TO RUN WITH AND HELD THEM BACK BUT CAP'N BILL HOBBLED QUICKER THAN HE HAD EVER HOBBLED BEFORE IN ALL HIS LIFE AND THEY REALLY MADE PRETTY GOOD PROGRESS
8190-284434-0015 WHICH HAD A BLUE IRON GATE IN IT HERE WAS A BLUESKIN GUARD WHO HAD BEEN PEACEFULLY SLUMBERING WHEN AROUSED BY THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE FUGITIVES HALT CRIED THE GUARD FIERCELY CAP'N BILL HALTED LONG ENOUGH TO GRAB THE MAN AROUND HIS LONG NECK WITH ONE HAND
8190-284434-0016 AND AROUND HIS LONG LEG WITH THE OTHER HAND THEN HE RAISED THE BLUESKIN IN THE AIR AND THREW HIM FAR OVER THE WALL
8190-284434-0017 WHERE THEY HEADED TOWARD THE LOW MOUNTAIN WHOSE OUTLINES WERE PLAINLY VISIBLE IN THE MOONLIGHT THE GUARD WAS NOW HOWLING AND CRYING FOR HELP IN THE CITY WERE ANSWERING SHOUTS A HUE AND CRY CAME FROM EVERY DIRECTION REACHING AS FAR AS THE PALACE
8190-284434-0018 LIGHTS BEGAN TO TWINKLE EVERYWHERE IN THE STREETS AND THE BLUE CITY HUMMED LIKE A BEEHIVE FILLED WITH ANGRY BEES IT WON'T DO FOR US TO GET CAUGHT NOW PANTED CAP'N BILL AS THEY RAN ALONG I'M MORE AFEARED O THEM BLUE CITIZENS NER I AM O THE BLUE BOOLOOROO
8190-284434-0019 THEY'D TEAR US TO PIECES IF THEY COULD SKY ISLAND WAS NOT A VERY BIG PLACE ESPECIALLY THE BLUE PART OF IT AND OUR FRIENDS WERE NOW VERY CLOSE TO THE LOW MOUNTAIN
8190-284434-0020 ABOVE WHICH WAS CARVED THE ONE WORD PHINIS
8190-284434-0021 WHISPERED TROT NO MORE DO I MATE HE ANSWERED I THINK I'D RATHER TAKE A CHANCE ON THE FOG BANK SAID BUTTON BRIGHT JUST THEN THEY WERE ALL STARTLED BY A SWIFT FLAPPING OF WINGS
8190-284434-0022 AND A VOICE CRIED IN SHRILL TONES WHERE ARE YOU TROT AS LIKE AS NOT I'VE BEEN FORGOT CAP'N BILL JUMPED THIS WAY AND BUTTON BRIGHT THAT
8190-284434-0023 HERE ALL ALONE IT'S PRETTY FAR BUT HERE WE ARE AND THEN HE BARKED LIKE A DOG AND CHUCKLED WITH GLEE AT HAVING FOUND HIS LITTLE FRIEND IN ESCAPING FROM THE PALACE TROT HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO LEAVE ALL THE PETS BEHIND HER BUT IT SEEMED THAT THE PARROT HAD FOUND SOME WAY TO GET FREE AND FOLLOW HER
8190-284434-0024 THEY WERE ALL ASTONISHED TO HEAR THE BIRD TALK AND IN POETRY TOO BUT CAP'N BILL TOLD TROT THAT SOME PARROTS HE HAD KNOWN HAD POSSESSED A PRETTY FAIR GIFT OF LANGUAGE AND HE ADDED THAT THIS BLUE ONE SEEMED AN UNUSUALLY BRIGHT BIRD AS FER PO'TRY SAID HE
8190-284434-0025 RHYMES COME FROM YOUR HEAD BUT REAL PO'TRY FROM YOUR HEART AN WHETHER THE BLUE PARROT HAS A HEART OR NOT HE'S SURE GOT A HEAD HAVING DECIDED NOT TO VENTURE INTO THE ARCH OF PHINIS THEY AGAIN STARTED ON
8190-284434-0026 THIS TIME ACROSS THE COUNTRY STRAIGHT TOWARD THE FOG BANK WHICH HUNG LIKE A BLUE GRAY CLOUD DIRECTLY ACROSS THE CENTER OF THE ISLAND THEY KNEW THEY WERE BEING FOLLOWED BY BANDS OF THE BLUESKINS FOR THEY COULD HEAR THE SHOUTS OF THEIR PURSUERS GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER EVERY MINUTE
8190-284434-0027 HAD THE JOURNEY BEEN MUCH FARTHER THE FUGITIVES WOULD HAVE BEEN OVERTAKEN BUT WHEN THE LEADERS OF THE PURSUING BLUESKINS WERE ONLY A FEW YARDS BEHIND THEM THEY REACHED THE EDGE OF THE FOG BANK AND WITHOUT HESITATION PLUNGED INTO ITS THICK MIST WHICH INSTANTLY HID THEM FROM VIEW
8190-284434-0028 THE BLUESKINS FELL BACK HORRIFIED AT THE MAD ACT OF THE STRANGERS TO THEM THE FOG BANK WAS THE MOST DREADFUL THING IN EXISTENCE AND NO BLUESKIN HAD EVER VENTURED WITHIN IT EVEN FOR A MOMENT
