8677-246948-0000 THE NEXT DAY THE CURATE CALLED AGAIN ON LEOPOLD BUT HELEN HAPPENED TO BE OTHERWISE ENGAGED FOR A FEW MINUTES AND MISSUS RAMSHORN TO BE IN THE SICK ROOM WHEN THE SERVANT BROUGHT HIS NAME WITH HER JEALOUSY OF WINGFOLD'S TEACHING SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED HIM
8677-246948-0001 BUT LINGARD MADE SUCH LOUD PROTEST WHEN HE HEARD HER SAY NOT AT HOME INSISTING ON SEEING HIM THAT SHE HAD TO GIVE WAY AND TELL THE MAID TO SHOW HIM UP SHE HAD NO NOTION HOWEVER OF LEAVING HIM ALONE IN THE ROOM WITH THE INVALID
8677-246948-0002 WHO COULD TELL WHAT ABSURD AND EXTRAVAGANT IDEAS HE MIGHT NOT PUT INTO THE BOY'S HEAD HE MIGHT MAKE HIM TURN MONK OR SOCINIAN OR LATTER DAY SAINT FOR WHAT SHE KNEW SO SHE SAT BLOCKING UP THE SOLE SMALL WINDOW IN THE YOUTH'S DARK DWELLING THAT LOOKED EASTWARD
8677-246948-0003 AND DAMMING BACK THE TIDE OF THE DAWN FROM HIS DISEASED AND TORMENTED SOUL LITTLE CONVERSATION WAS THEREFORE POSSIBLE
8677-246948-0004 HER WHOLE BEARING NOW AS ALWAYS WAS THAT OF ONE WHO PERFECTLY TRUSTED A SUPREME SPIRIT UNDER WHOSE INFLUENCES LAY EVEN THE RUGGED MATERIAL OF HER DEFORMED DWELLING POLWARTH ALLOWED WINGFOLD TO HELP HIM IN GETTING TEA
8677-246948-0005 AND THE CONVERSATION AS WILL BE THE CASE WHERE ALL ARE IN EARNEST QUICKLY FOUND THE RIGHT CHANNEL IT IS NOT OFTEN IN REAL LIFE THAT SUCH CONVERSATIONS OCCUR GENERALLY IN ANY TALK WORTH CALLING CONVERSATION EVERY MAN HAS SOME POINT TO MAINTAIN
8677-246948-0006 AND HIS OBJECT IS TO JUSTIFY HIS OWN THESIS AND DISPROVE HIS NEIGHBOUR'S I WILL ALLOW THAT HE MAY PRIMARILY HAVE ADOPTED HIS THESIS BECAUSE OF SOME SIGN OF TRUTH IN IT BUT HIS MODE OF SUPPORTING IT IS GENERALLY SUCH AS TO BLOCK UP EVERY CRANNY IN HIS SOUL
8677-246948-0007 AT WHICH MORE TRUTH MIGHT ENTER IN THE PRESENT CASE UNUSUAL AS IT IS FOR SO MANY AS THREE TRUTH LOVING MEN TO COME THUS TOGETHER ON THE FACE OF THIS PLANET HERE WERE THREE SIMPLY SET ON UTTERING TRUTH THEY HAD SEEN AND GAINING SIGHT OF TRUTH AS YET VEILED FROM THEM
8677-246948-0008 I SHALL ATTEMPT ONLY A GENERAL IMPRESSION OF THE RESULT OF THEIR EVENING'S INTERCOURSE PARTLY RECORDING THE UTTERANCES OF POLWARTH
8677-246948-0009 BUT I CANNOT GET A HOLD OF YOUR REMARKS ONE MOMENT I THINK I HAVE GOT THE END OF THE CLEW
8677-246948-0010 WOULD YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN BY DIVINE SERVICE FOR I THINK YOU MUST USE THE PHRASE IN SOME DIFFERENT SENSE FROM WHAT I HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO AH I OUGHT TO REMEMBER SAID POLWARTH THAT WHAT HAS GROWN FAMILIAR TO MY MIND FROM MUCH SOLITARY THINKING
8677-246948-0011 MAY NOT AT ONCE SHOW ITSELF TO ANOTHER WHEN PRESENTED IN THE FORMS OF A FOREIGN INDIVIDUALITY
8677-246948-0012 WHEN I USE THE PHRASE DIVINE SERVICE I MEAN NOTHING WHATEVER BELONGING TO THE CHURCH OR ITS OBSERVANCES I MEAN BY IT WHAT IT OUGHT TO MEAN THE SERVING OF GOD THE DOING OF SOMETHING FOR GOD
8677-246948-0013 SHALL I MAKE OF THE CHURCH IN MY FOOLISH IMAGINATIONS A TEMPLE OF IDOLATROUS WORSHIP BY SUPPOSING THAT IT IS FOR THE SAKE OF SUPPLYING SOME NEED THAT GOD HAS OR OF GRATIFYING SOME TASTE IN HIM THAT I THERE LISTEN TO HIS WORD SAY PRAYERS TO HIM AND SING HIS PRAISES
8677-246948-0014 SHALL I BE SUCH A DULL MULE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LIVING TRUTH OR TO USE A HOMELY SIMILE SHALL I BE AS THE GOOD BOY OF THE NURSERY RHYME WHO SEATED IN HIS CORNER OF SELFISH COMPLACENCY REGARDS THE EATING OF HIS PIE AS A VIRTUOUS ACTION
8677-246948-0015 ENJOYS THE CONTEMPLATION OF IT AND THINKS WHAT A PLEASANT OBJECT HE THUS MAKES OF HIMSELF TO HIS PARENTS SHALL I TO TAKE A STEP FARTHER DEGRADE THE SANCTITY OF THE CLOSET HALLOWED IN THE WORDS OF JESUS
8677-246948-0016 BY SHUTTING ITS DOOR IN THE VAIN FANCY OF THERE DOING SOMETHING THAT GOD REQUIRES OF ME AS A SACRED OBSERVANCE SHALL I FOOLISHLY IMAGINE THAT TO PUT IN EXERCISE THE HIGHEST AND LOVELIEST THE MOST ENTRANCING PRIVILEGE OF EXISTENCE
8677-246948-0017 BUT WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF A CHILD WHO SAID I AM VERY USEFUL TO MY FATHER FOR WHEN I ASK HIM FOR ANYTHING OR TELL HIM I LOVE HIM IT GIVES HIM OH SUCH PLEASURE I SHOULD SAY HE WAS AN UNENDURABLE PRIG BETTER HE HAD TO BE WHIPPED FOR STEALING SAID THE CURATE
8677-246948-0018 THERE WOULD BE MORE HOPE OF HIS FUTURE RETURNED POLWARTH IS THE CHILD HE CONTINUED WHO SITS BY HIS FATHER'S KNEE AND LOOKS UP INTO HIS FATHER'S FACE SERVING THAT FATHER BECAUSE THE HEART OF THE FATHER DELIGHTS TO LOOK DOWN UPON HIS CHILD
8677-246948-0019 AND SHALL THE MOMENT OF MY DEEPEST REPOSE AND BLISS THE MOMENT WHEN I SERVE MYSELF WITH THE VERY LIFE OF THE UNIVERSE BE CALLED A SERVING OF MY GOD IT IS COMMUNION WITH GOD HE HOLDS IT WITH ME ELSE NEVER COULD I HOLD IT WITH HIM I AM AS THE FOAM FROTH UPON HIS INFINITE OCEAN
8677-246948-0020 SPRINGS FROM HIS SEAT AT MY KNEE FINDS THAT WHICH WILL MEET MY NECESSITY AND IS MY EAGER HAPPY SERVANT OF CONSEQUENCE IN HIS OWN EYES INASMUCH AS HE HAS DONE SOMETHING FOR HIS FATHER HIS SEAT BY MY KNEE IS LOVE DELIGHT WELL BEING PEACE NOT SERVICE
8677-246948-0021 BECAUSE I WANT TO BE NEAR YOU FATHER IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY COME NEARER STILL COME TO MY BOSOM MY CHILD AND BE YET HAPPIER TALK NOT OF PUBLIC WORSHIP AS DIVINE SERVICE IT IS A MOCKERY
8677-246948-0022 PERFECT IN WISDOM STRENGTH AND EVERYTHING OF WHOM PAUL SAYS THAT HE IS NOT WORSHIPPED WITH MEN'S HANDS AS THOUGH HE NEEDED ANYTHING I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT YOU ARE FIGHTING MERELY WITH A WORD
8677-246948-0023 IT STANDS MERELY FOR THE FORMS OF PUBLIC WORSHIP WERE THERE NO SUCH THING AS DIVINE SERVICE IN THE TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD THEN INDEED IT WOULD SCARCELY BE WORTH WHILE TO QUARREL WITH ITS MISAPPLICATION BUT I ASSERT THAT TRUE AND GENUINE SERVICE MAY BE RENDERED TO THE LIVING GOD
8677-246948-0024 NOR IS IT HARD TO DISCOVER HOW FOR GOD IS IN EVERY CREATURE THAT HE HAS MADE AND IN THEIR NEEDS HE IS NEEDY AND IN ALL THEIR AFFLICTIONS HE IS AFFLICTED THEREFORE JESUS SAYS THAT WHATEVER IS DONE TO ONE OF HIS LITTLE ONES IS DONE TO HIM
8677-246948-0025 AND IF THE SOUL OF A MAN BE THE TEMPLE OF THE SPIRIT THEN IS THE PLACE OF THAT MAN'S LABOUR HIS SHOP HIS COUNTING HOUSE HIS LABORATORY THE TEMPLE OF JESUS CHRIST WHERE THE SPIRIT OF THE MAN IS INCARNATE IN WORK MISTER DREW
8677-246948-0026 YOUR COUNTER IS OR OUGHT TO BE HIS ALTAR AND EVERYTHING THEREON LAID WITH INTENT OF DOING AS WELL AS YOU CAN FOR YOUR NEIGHBOUR IN THE NAME OF THE MAN CHRIST JESUS IS A TRUE SACRIFICE OFFERED TO HIM
8677-246948-0027 I SAY NOT POLWARTH WENT ON THAT SO DOING YOU WILL GROW A RICH MAN BUT I SAY THAT SO DOING YOU WILL BE SAVED FROM GROWING TOO RICH AND THAT YOU WILL BE A FELLOW WORKER WITH GOD FOR THE SALVATION OF HIS WORLD
8677-246948-0028 I MUST LIVE I CANNOT GIVE MY GOODS AWAY MURMURED MISTER DREW THINKINGLY AS ONE THAT SOUGHT ENLIGHTENMENT THAT WOULD BE TO GO DIRECT AGAINST THE ORDER OF HIS WORLD SAID POLWARTH NO A HARDER TASK IS YOURS MISTER DREW
8677-246948-0029 TO MAKE YOUR BUSINESS A GAIN TO YOU AND AT THE SAME TIME TO BE NOT ONLY WHAT IS COMMONLY COUNTED JUST BUT INTERESTED IN AND CAREFUL OF AND CARING FOR YOUR NEIGHBOUR AS A SERVANT OF THE GOD OF BOUNTY WHO GIVETH TO ALL MEN LIBERALLY
8677-246948-0030 YOUR CALLING IS TO DO THE BEST FOR YOUR NEIGHBOUR THAT YOU REASONABLY CAN BUT WHO IS TO FIX WHAT IS REASONABLE ASKED DREW THE MAN HIMSELF THINKING IN THE PRESENCE OF JESUS CHRIST THERE IS A HOLY MODERATION WHICH IS OF GOD
8677-246948-0031 BUT I WILL NOT JUDGE THAT IS FOR THE GOD ENLIGHTENED CONSCIENCE OF THE MAN HIMSELF TO DO NOT FOR HIS NEIGHBOUR'S WHY SHOULD I BE JUDGED BY ANOTHER MAN'S CONSCIENCE BUT YOU SEE MISTER DREW AND THIS IS WHAT I WAS DRIVING AT THAT YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR POWER TO SERVE GOD
8677-246948-0032 THROUGH THE NEEDS OF HIS CHILDREN ALL THE WORKING DAY FROM MORNING TO NIGHT SO LONG AS THERE IS A CUSTOMER IN YOUR SHOP I DO THINK YOU ARE RIGHT SIR SAID THE LINEN DRAPER I HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE SAME THING THE OTHER NIGHT MYSELF
8677-246948-0033 AND YET IT SEEMS AS IF YOU SPOKE OF A PURELY IDEAL STATE ONE THAT COULD NOT BE REALISED IN THIS WORLD PURELY IDEAL OR NOT ONE THING IS CERTAIN IT WILL NEVER BE REACHED BY ONE WHO IS SO INDIFFERENT TO IT AS TO BELIEVE IT IMPOSSIBLE
8677-246948-0034 WHETHER IT MAY BE REACHED IN THIS WORLD OR NOT THAT IS A QUESTION OF NO CONSEQUENCE WHETHER A MAN HAS BEGUN TO REACH AFTER IT IS OF THE UTMOST AWFULNESS OF IMPORT
8677-246948-0035 THE ASPIRATION THE IMAGINATION OF THE MAN WHEN THE MAN THROWS WIDE HIS DOOR TO THE FATHER OF HIS SPIRIT WHEN HIS INDIVIDUAL BEING IS THUS SUPPLEMENTED TO USE A POOR MISERABLE WORD WITH THE INDIVIDUALITY THAT ORIGINATED IT
8677-246948-0036 THEN IS THE MAN A WHOLE HEALTHY COMPLETE EXISTENCE THEN INDEED AND THEN ONLY WILL HE DO NO WRONG THINK NO WRONG LOVE PERFECTLY AND BE RIGHT MERRY THEN WILL HE SCARCE THINK OF PRAYING BECAUSE GOD IS IN EVERY THOUGHT AND ENTERS ANEW WITH EVERY SENSATION
8677-246948-0037 THEN WILL HE FORGIVE AND ENDURE AND POUR OUT HIS SOUL FOR THE BELOVED WHO YET GROPE THEIR WAY IN DOUBT AND PASSION THEN EVERY MAN WILL BE DEAR AND PRECIOUS TO HIM EVEN THE WORST FOR IN HIM ALSO LIES AN UNKNOWN YEARNING AFTER THE SAME PEACE WHEREIN HE RESTS AND LOVES
