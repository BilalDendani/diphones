803-139752-0000 HOW NUTH WOULD HAVE PRACTISED HIS ART UPON THE GNOLES DESPITE THE ADVERTISEMENTS OF RIVAL FIRMS IT IS PROBABLE THAT EVERY TRADESMAN KNOWS THAT NOBODY IN BUSINESS AT THE PRESENT TIME
803-139752-0001 HAS A POSITION EQUAL TO THAT OF MISTER NUTH TO THOSE OUTSIDE THE MAGIC CIRCLE OF BUSINESS
803-139752-0002 AND WHATEVER CLAIMS THEY BOAST HIS RIVALS KNOW IT HIS TERMS ARE MODERATE SO MUCH CASH DOWN WHEN THE GOODS ARE DELIVERED SO MUCH IN BLACKMAIL AFTERWARDS HE CONSULTS YOUR CONVENIENCE
803-139752-0003 HIS SKILL MAY BE COUNTED UPON I HAVE SEEN A SHADOW ON A WINDY NIGHT MOVE MORE NOISILY THAN NUTH FOR NUTH IS A BURGLAR BY TRADE MEN HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO STAY IN COUNTRY HOUSES
803-139752-0004 THESE MOULDERING CHAIRS THESE FULL LENGTH ANCESTORS AND CARVED MAHOGANY ARE THE PRODUCE OF THE INCOMPARABLE NUTH IT MAY BE URGED AGAINST MY USE OF THE WORD INCOMPARABLE THAT IN THE BURGLARY BUSINESS THE NAME OF SLITH
803-139752-0005 STANDS PARAMOUNT AND ALONE AND OF THIS I AM NOT IGNORANT BUT SLITH IS A CLASSIC AND LIVED LONG AGO AND KNEW NOTHING AT ALL OF MODERN COMPETITION BESIDES WHICH
803-139752-0006 THE SURPRISING NATURE OF HIS DOOM HAS POSSIBLY CAST A GLAMOUR UPON SLITH THAT EXAGGERATES IN OUR EYES HIS UNDOUBTED MERITS IT MUST NOT BE THOUGHT THAT I AM A FRIEND OF NUTH'S
803-139752-0007 ON THE CONTRARY SUCH POLITICS AS I HAVE ARE ON THE SIDE OF PROPERTY AND HE NEEDS NO WORDS FROM ME FOR HIS POSITION IS ALMOST UNIQUE IN TRADE
803-139752-0008 WHENEVER ANYONE CAME TO INSPECT IT BEFORE PURCHASE THE CARETAKER USED TO PRAISE THE HOUSE IN THE WORDS THAT NUTH HAD SUGGESTED IF IT WASN'T FOR THE DRAINS SHE WOULD SAY IT'S THE FINEST HOUSE IN LONDON
803-139752-0009 HERE IN A NEAT BLACK DRESS ON ONE SPRING MORNING CAME AN OLD WOMAN WHOSE BONNET WAS LINED WITH RED ASKING FOR MISTER NUTH AND WITH HER CAME HER LARGE AND AWKWARD SON MISSUS EGGINS THE CARETAKER
803-139752-0010 AND THERE WAS NUTH STANDING QUITE CLOSE TO THEM LORD SAID THE OLD WOMAN WHOSE BONNET WAS LINED WITH RED YOU DID MAKE ME START AND THEN SHE SAW BY HIS EYES THAT THAT WAS NOT THE WAY TO SPEAK TO MISTER NUTH
803-139752-0011 FIRST OF ALL NUTH WANTED TO SEE A BUSINESS REFERENCE AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN ONE FROM A JEWELLER WITH WHOM HE HAPPENED TO BE HAND IN GLOVE THE UPSHOT OF IT WAS THAT HE AGREED TO TAKE YOUNG TONKER FOR THIS WAS THE SURNAME OF THE LIKELY LAD
803-139752-0012 AND TO MAKE HIM HIS APPRENTICE AND THE OLD WOMAN WHOSE BONNET WAS LINED WITH RED WENT BACK TO HER LITTLE COTTAGE IN THE COUNTRY AND EVERY EVENING SAID TO HER OLD MAN TONKER WE MUST FASTEN THE SHUTTERS OF A NIGHT TIME FOR TOMMY'S A BURGLAR NOW
803-139752-0013 THE DETAILS OF THE LIKELY LAD'S APPRENTICESHIP I DO NOT PROPOSE TO GIVE FOR THOSE THAT ARE IN THE BUSINESS KNOW THOSE DETAILS ALREADY AND THOSE THAT ARE IN OTHER BUSINESSES CARE ONLY FOR THEIR OWN WHILE MEN OF LEISURE WHO HAVE NO TRADE AT ALL
803-139752-0014 WOULD FAIL TO APPRECIATE THE GRADUAL DEGREES BY WHICH TOMMY TONKER CAME FIRST TO CROSS BARE BOARDS COVERED WITH LITTLE OBSTACLES IN THE DARK WITHOUT MAKING ANY SOUND AND THEN TO GO SILENTLY UP CREAKY STAIRS AND THEN
803-139752-0015 TO OPEN DOORS AND LASTLY TO CLIMB LET IT SUFFICE THAT THE BUSINESS PROSPERED GREATLY WHILE GLOWING REPORTS OF TOMMY TONKER'S PROGRESS WERE SENT FROM TIME TO TIME TO THE OLD WOMAN WHOSE BONNET WAS LINED WITH RED
803-139752-0016 NUTH HAD GIVEN UP LESSONS IN WRITING VERY EARLY FOR HE SEEMED TO HAVE SOME PREJUDICE AGAINST FORGERY AND THEREFORE CONSIDERED WRITING A WASTE OF TIME AND THEN THERE CAME THE TRANSACTION WITH LORD CASTLENORMAN AT HIS SURREY RESIDENCE
803-139752-0017 INSTRUCTED BY MISTER NUTH WHO WAITED OUTSIDE CAME AWAY WITH ONE POCKETFUL OF RINGS AND SHIRT STUDS IT WAS QUITE A LIGHT POCKETFUL BUT THE JEWELLERS IN PARIS COULD NOT MATCH IT WITHOUT SENDING SPECIALLY TO AFRICA
803-139752-0018 SO THAT LORD CASTLENORMAN HAD TO BORROW BONE SHIRT STUDS NOT EVEN RUMOUR WHISPERED THE NAME OF NUTH WERE I TO SAY THAT THIS TURNED HIS HEAD THERE ARE THOSE TO WHOM THE ASSERTION WOULD GIVE PAIN
803-139752-0019 FOR HIS ASSOCIATES HOLD THAT HIS ASTUTE JUDGMENT WAS UNAFFECTED BY CIRCUMSTANCE I WILL SAY THEREFORE THAT IT SPURRED HIS GENIUS TO PLAN WHAT NO BURGLAR HAD EVER PLANNED BEFORE IT WAS NOTHING LESS THAN TO BURGLE THE HOUSE OF THE GNOLES
803-139752-0020 AND THIS THAT ABSTEMIOUS MAN UNFOLDED TO TONKER OVER A CUP OF TEA HAD TONKER NOT BEEN NEARLY INSANE WITH PRIDE OVER THEIR RECENT TRANSACTION AND HAD HE NOT BEEN BLINDED BY A VENERATION FOR NUTH HE WOULD HAVE
803-139752-0021 BUT I CRY OVER SPILT MILK HE EXPOSTULATED RESPECTFULLY HE SAID HE WOULD RATHER NOT GO HE SAID IT WAS NOT FAIR HE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO ARGUE
803-139752-0022 AND IN THE END ONE WINDY OCTOBER MORNING WITH A MENACE IN THE AIR FOUND HIM AND NUTH DRAWING NEAR TO THE DREADFUL WOOD NUTH BY WEIGHING LITTLE EMERALDS AGAINST PIECES OF COMMON ROCK HAD ASCERTAINED THE PROBABLE WEIGHT OF THOSE HOUSE ORNAMENTS
803-139752-0023 THAT THE GNOLES ARE BELIEVED TO POSSESS IN THE NARROW LOFTY HOUSE WHEREIN THEY HAVE DWELT FROM OF OLD THEY DECIDED TO STEAL TWO EMERALDS AND TO CARRY THEM BETWEEN THEM ON A CLOAK BUT IF THEY SHOULD BE TOO HEAVY ONE MUST BE DROPPED AT ONCE
803-139752-0024 NUTH WARNED YOUNG TONKER AGAINST GREED AND EXPLAINED THAT THE EMERALDS WERE WORTH LESS THAN CHEESE UNTIL THEY WERE SAFE AWAY FROM THE DREADFUL WOOD EVERYTHING HAD BEEN PLANNED AND THEY WALKED NOW IN SILENCE
803-139752-0025 NO TRACK LED UP TO THE SINISTER GLOOM OF THE TREES EITHER OF MEN OR CATTLE NOT EVEN A POACHER HAD BEEN THERE SNARING ELVES FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS YOU DID NOT TRESPASS TWICE IN THE DELLS OF THE GNOLES
803-139752-0026 AND WITHOUT ONE WINDOW AT ALL FACING IN THAT DIRECTION THEY DID NOT SPEAK OF IT THERE AND ELSEWHERE IT IS UNHEARD OF INTO THIS WOOD STEPPED NUTH AND TOMMY TONKER THEY HAD NO FIREARMS
803-139752-0027 TONKER HAD ASKED FOR A PISTOL BUT NUTH REPLIED THAT THE SOUND OF A SHOT WOULD BRING EVERYTHING DOWN ON US AND NO MORE WAS SAID ABOUT IT INTO THE WOOD THEY WENT ALL DAY DEEPER AND DEEPER
803-139752-0028 THEY SAW THE SKELETON OF SOME EARLY GEORGIAN POACHER NAILED TO A DOOR IN AN OAK TREE SOMETIMES THEY SAW A FAIRY SCUTTLE AWAY FROM THEM ONCE TONKER STEPPED HEAVILY ON A HARD DRY STICK AFTER WHICH THEY BOTH LAY STILL FOR TWENTY MINUTES
803-139752-0029 AND THE SUNSET FLARED FULL OF OMENS THROUGH THE TREE TRUNKS AND NIGHT FELL AND THEY CAME BY FITFUL STARLIGHT AS NUTH HAD FORESEEN TO THAT LEAN HIGH HOUSE WHERE THE GNOLES SO SECRETLY DWELT
803-139752-0030 ALL WAS SO SILENT BY THAT UNVALUED HOUSE THAT THE FADED COURAGE OF TONKER FLICKERED UP BUT TO NUTH'S EXPERIENCED SENSE IT SEEMED TOO SILENT AND ALL THE WHILE THERE WAS THAT LOOK IN THE SKY
803-139752-0031 THAT WAS WORSE THAN A SPOKEN DOOM SO THAT NUTH AS IS OFTEN THE CASE WHEN MEN ARE IN DOUBT HAD LEISURE TO FEAR THE WORST NEVERTHELESS HE DID NOT ABANDON THE BUSINESS BUT SENT THE LIKELY LAD WITH THE INSTRUMENTS OF HIS TRADE
803-139752-0032 TO THE OLD GREEN CASEMENT AND THE MOMENT THAT TONKER TOUCHED THE WITHERED BOARDS THE SILENCE THAT THOUGH OMINOUS WAS EARTHLY BECAME UNEARTHLY LIKE THE TOUCH OF A GHOUL AND TONKER HEARD HIS BREATH OFFENDING AGAINST THAT SILENCE
803-139752-0033 AND TONKER PRAYED THAT A MOUSE OR A MOLE MIGHT MAKE ANY NOISE AT ALL BUT NOT A CREATURE STIRRED EVEN NUTH WAS STILL AND THEN AND THERE WHILE YET HE WAS UNDISCOVERED THE LIKELY LAD MADE UP HIS MIND
803-139752-0034 AS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE LONG BEFORE TO LEAVE THOSE COLOSSAL EMERALDS WHERE THEY WERE AND HAVE NOTHING FURTHER TO DO WITH THE LEAN HIGH HOUSE OF THE GNOLES BUT TO QUIT THIS SINISTER WOOD IN THE NICK OF TIME AND RETIRE FROM BUSINESS AT ONCE
803-139752-0035 AND BUY A PLACE IN THE COUNTRY THEN HE DESCENDED SOFTLY AND BECKONED TO NUTH BUT THE GNOLES HAD WATCHED HIM THROUGH KNAVISH HOLES THAT THEY BORE IN TRUNKS OF THE TREES
803-139752-0036 AND THE UNEARTHLY SILENCE GAVE WAY AS IT WERE WITH A GRACE TO THE RAPID SCREAMS OF TONKER AS THEY PICKED HIM UP FROM BEHIND SCREAMS THAT CAME FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL THEY WERE INCOHERENT
803-139752-0037 AND WHERE THEY TOOK HIM IT IS NOT GOOD TO ASK AND WHAT THEY DID WITH HIM I SHALL NOT SAY NUTH LOOKED ON FOR A WHILE FROM THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE WITH A MILD SURPRISE ON HIS FACE AS HE RUBBED HIS CHIN
803-139752-0038 FOR THE TRICK OF THE HOLES IN THE TREES WAS NEW TO HIM THEN HE STOLE NIMBLY AWAY THROUGH THE DREADFUL WOOD AND DID THEY CATCH NUTH YOU ASK ME GENTLE READER
