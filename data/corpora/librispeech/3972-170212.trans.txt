3972-170212-0000 A MILE AND A HALF IT MAY BE TWO MILES SOUTHEAST OF BETHLEHEM THERE IS A PLAIN SEPARATED FROM THE TOWN BY AN INTERVENING SWELL OF THE MOUNTAIN BESIDES BEING WELL SHELTERED FROM THE NORTH WINDS
3972-170212-0001 THE VALE WAS COVERED WITH A GROWTH OF SYCAMORE DWARF OAK AND PINE TREES WHILE IN THE GLENS AND RAVINES ADJOINING THERE WERE THICKETS OF OLIVE AND MULBERRY ALL AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR INVALUABLE FOR THE SUPPORT OF SHEEP GOATS AND CATTLE OF WHICH THE WANDERING FLOCKS CONSISTED
3972-170212-0002 AT THE SIDE FARTHEST FROM THE TOWN CLOSE UNDER A BLUFF THERE WAS AN EXTENSIVE MARAH OR SHEEPCOT AGES OLD IN SOME LONG FORGOTTEN FORAY THE BUILDING HAD BEEN UNROOFED AND ALMOST DEMOLISHED THE ENCLOSURE ATTACHED TO IT REMAINED INTACT HOWEVER
3972-170212-0003 AND THAT WAS OF MORE IMPORTANCE TO THE SHEPHERDS WHO DROVE THEIR CHARGES THITHER THAN THE HOUSE ITSELF THE STONE WALL AROUND THE LOT WAS HIGH AS A MAN'S HEAD YET NOT SO HIGH BUT THAT SOMETIMES A PANTHER OR A LION HUNGERING FROM THE WILDERNESS LEAPED BOLDLY IN
3972-170212-0004 ON THE INNER SIDE OF THE WALL AND AS AN ADDITIONAL SECURITY AGAINST THE CONSTANT DANGER A HEDGE OF THE RHAMNUS HAD BEEN PLANTED
3972-170212-0005 SEEKING FRESH WALKS FOR THEIR FLOCKS LED THEM UP TO THIS PLAIN AND FROM EARLY MORNING THE GROVES HAD BEEN MADE RING WITH CALLS AND THE BLOWS OF AXES THE BLEATING OF SHEEP AND GOATS THE TINKLING OF BELLS THE LOWING OF CATTLE AND THE BARKING OF DOGS
3972-170212-0006 WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN THEY LED THE WAY TO THE MARAH AND BY NIGHTFALL HAD EVERYTHING SAFE IN THE FIELD THEN THEY KINDLED A FIRE DOWN BY THE GATE PARTOOK OF THEIR HUMBLE SUPPER AND SAT DOWN TO REST AND TALK LEAVING ONE ON WATCH
3972-170212-0007 THERE WERE SIX OF THESE MEN OMITTING THE WATCHMAN AND AFTERWHILE THEY ASSEMBLED IN A GROUP NEAR THE FIRE SOME SITTING SOME LYING PRONE
3972-170212-0008 AS THEY WENT BAREHEADED HABITUALLY THEIR HAIR STOOD OUT IN THICK COARSE SUNBURNT SHOCKS THEIR BEARD COVERED THEIR THROATS AND FELL IN MATS DOWN THE BREAST MANTLES OF THE SKIN OF KIDS AND LAMBS WITH THE FLEECE ON WRAPPED THEM FROM NECK TO KNEE
3972-170212-0009 LEAVING THE ARMS EXPOSED BROAD BELTS GIRTHED THE RUDE GARMENTS TO THEIR WAISTS THEIR SANDALS WERE OF THE COARSEST QUALITY FROM THEIR RIGHT SHOULDERS HUNG SCRIPS CONTAINING FOOD AND SELECTED STONES FOR SLINGS WITH WHICH THEY WERE ARMED
3972-170212-0010 ON THE GROUND NEAR EACH ONE LAY HIS CROOK A SYMBOL OF HIS CALLING AND A WEAPON OF OFFENCE SUCH WERE THE SHEPHERDS OF JUDEA IN APPEARANCE ROUGH AND SAVAGE AS THE GAUNT DOGS SITTING WITH THEM AROUND THE BLAZE IN FACT SIMPLE MINDED TENDER HEARTED
3972-170212-0011 AT BIRTH IT BECAME HIS CHARGE HIS TO KEEP ALL ITS DAYS TO HELP OVER THE FLOODS TO CARRY DOWN THE HOLLOWS TO NAME AND TRAIN IT WAS TO BE HIS COMPANION HIS OBJECT OF THOUGHT AND INTEREST THE SUBJECT OF HIS WILL
3972-170212-0012 IT WAS TO ENLIVEN AND SHARE HIS WANDERINGS IN ITS DEFENSE HE MIGHT BE CALLED ON TO FACE THE LION OR ROBBER TO DIE THE GREAT EVENTS SUCH AS BLOTTED OUT NATIONS AND CHANGED THE MASTERY OF THE WORLD
3972-170212-0013 AS WAS HER HABIT IN THOSE DAYS ROME DID NOT WAIT FOR PEOPLE SLOW TO INQUIRE ABOUT HER SHE CAME TO THEM OVER THE HILLS ALONG WHICH HE WAS LEADING HIS LAGGING HERD OR IN THE FASTNESSES IN WHICH HE WAS HIDING THEM
3972-170212-0014 NOT UNFREQUENTLY THE SHEPHERD WAS STARTLED BY THE BLARE OF TRUMPETS AND PEERING OUT BEHELD A COHORT SOMETIMES A LEGION IN MARCH AND WHEN THE GLITTERING CRESTS WERE GONE AND THE EXCITEMENT INCIDENT TO THE INTRUSION OVER HE BENT HIMSELF TO EVOLVE THE MEANING OF THE EAGLES AND GILDED GLOBES OF THE SOLDIERY AND THE CHARM OF A LIFE SO THE OPPOSITE OF HIS OWN YET THESE MEN RUDE AND SIMPLE AS THEY WERE HAD A KNOWLEDGE AND A WISDOM OF THEIR OWN
3972-170212-0015 WHEN THE SHELIACH READ THE TEXT NONE LISTENED TO THE INTERPRETER WITH MORE ABSOLUTE FAITH AND NONE TOOK AWAY WITH THEM MORE OF THE ELDER'S SERMON OR GAVE IT MORE THOUGHT AFTERWARDS
3972-170212-0016 IN A VERSE OF THE SHEMA THEY FOUND ALL THE LEARNING AND ALL THE LAW OF THEIR SIMPLE LIVES THAT THEIR LORD WAS ONE GOD AND THAT THEY MUST LOVE HIM WITH ALL THEIR SOULS AND THEY LOVED HIM AND SUCH WAS THEIR WISDOM SURPASSING THAT OF KINGS
3972-170212-0017 WHILE THEY TALKED AND BEFORE THE FIRST WATCH WAS OVER ONE BY ONE THE SHEPHERDS WENT TO SLEEP EACH LYING WHERE HE HAD SAT THE NIGHT LIKE MOST NIGHTS OF THE WINTER SEASON IN THE HILL COUNTRY WAS CLEAR CRISP AND SPARKLING WITH STARS
3972-170212-0018 THERE WAS NO WIND THE ATMOSPHERE SEEMED NEVER SO PURE AND THE STILLNESS WAS MORE THAN SILENCE IT WAS A HOLY HUSH A WARNING THAT HEAVEN WAS STOOPING LOW TO WHISPER SOME GOOD THING TO THE LISTENING EARTH
3972-170212-0019 BY THE GATE HUGGING HIS MANTLE CLOSE THE WATCHMAN WALKED AT TIMES HE STOPPED ATTRACTED BY A STIR AMONG THE SLEEPING HERDS OR BY A JACKAL'S CRY OFF ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE THE MIDNIGHT WAS SLOW COMING TO HIM BUT AT LAST IT CAME
3972-170212-0020 HIS TASK WAS DONE NOW FOR THE DREAMLESS SLEEP WITH WHICH LABOR BLESSES ITS WEARIED CHILDREN HE MOVED TOWARDS THE FIRE BUT PAUSED A LIGHT WAS BREAKING AROUND HIM SOFT AND WHITE LIKE THE MOON'S HE WAITED BREATHLESSLY
3972-170212-0021 THE LIGHT DEEPENED THINGS BEFORE INVISIBLE CAME TO VIEW HE SAW THE WHOLE FIELD AND ALL IT SHELTERED A CHILL SHARPER THAN THAT OF THE FROSTY AIR A CHILL OF FEAR SMOTE HIM
3972-170212-0022 HE LOOKED UP THE STARS WERE GONE THE LIGHT WAS DROPPING AS FROM A WINDOW IN THE SKY AS HE LOOKED IT BECAME A SPLENDOR THEN IN TERROR HE CRIED AWAKE AWAKE UP SPRANG THE DOGS AND HOWLING RAN AWAY
3972-170212-0023 THE HERDS RUSHED TOGETHER BEWILDERED THE MEN CLAMBERED TO THEIR FEET WEAPONS IN HAND WHAT IS IT THEY ASKED IN ONE VOICE SEE CRIED THE WATCHMAN THE SKY IS ON FIRE
3972-170212-0024 SUDDENLY THE LIGHT BECAME INTOLERABLY BRIGHT AND THEY COVERED THEIR EYES AND DROPPED UPON THEIR KNEES THEN AS THEIR SOULS SHRANK WITH FEAR THEY FELL UPON THEIR FACES BLIND AND FAINTING AND WOULD HAVE DIED HAD NOT A VOICE SAID TO THEM FEAR NOT
3972-170212-0025 AND THEY LISTENED FEAR NOT FOR BEHOLD I BRING YOU GOOD TIDINGS OF GREAT JOY WHICH SHALL BE TO ALL PEOPLE THE VOICE IN SWEETNESS AND SOOTHING MORE THAN HUMAN AND LOW AND CLEAR PENETRATED ALL THEIR BEING AND FILLED THEM WITH ASSURANCE
3972-170212-0026 THEY ROSE UPON THEIR KNEES AND LOOKING WORSHIPFULLY BEHELD IN THE CENTRE OF A GREAT GLORY THE APPEARANCE OF A MAN CLAD IN A ROBE INTENSELY WHITE
3972-170212-0027 ABOVE ITS SHOULDERS TOWERED THE TOPS OF WINGS SHINING AND FOLDED A STAR OVER ITS FOREHEAD GLOWED WITH STEADY LUSTRE BRILLIANT AS HESPERUS ITS HANDS WERE STRETCHED TOWARDS THEM IN BLESSING ITS FACE WAS SERENE AND DIVINELY BEAUTIFUL
