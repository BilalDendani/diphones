5746-48361-0000 ANTIPATER'S NAVIGATION FROM ROME TO HIS FATHER
5746-48361-0001 UPON ANTIPATER'S WRITING TO HIM THAT HAVING DONE ALL THAT HE WAS TO DO AND THIS IN THE MANNER HE WAS TO DO IT HE WOULD SUDDENLY COME TO HIM CONCEALED HIS ANGER AGAINST HIM AND WROTE BACK TO HIM AND BID HIM NOT DELAY HIS JOURNEY LEST ANY HARM SHOULD BEFALL HIMSELF IN HIS ABSENCE
5746-48361-0002 AT THE SAME TIME ALSO HE MADE SOME LITTLE COMPLAINT ABOUT HIS MOTHER BUT PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LAY THOSE COMPLAINTS ASIDE WHEN HE SHOULD RETURN HE WITHAL EXPRESSED HIS ENTIRE AFFECTION FOR HIM AS FEARING LEST HE SHOULD HAVE SOME SUSPICION OF HIM AND DEFER HIS JOURNEY TO HIM
5746-48361-0003 AND LEST WHILE HE LIVED AT ROME HE SHOULD LAY PLOTS FOR THE KINGDOM AND MOREOVER DO SOMEWHAT AGAINST HIMSELF
5746-48361-0004 NOW SOME OF HIS FRIENDS ADVISED HIM THAT HE SHOULD TARRY A WHILE SOME WHERE IN EXPECTATION OF FURTHER INFORMATION BUT OTHERS ADVISED HIM TO SAIL HOME WITHOUT DELAY FOR THAT IF HE WERE ONCE COME THITHER HE WOULD SOON PUT AN END TO ALL ACCUSATIONS
5746-48361-0005 AND THAT NOTHING AFFORDED ANY WEIGHT TO HIS ACCUSERS AT PRESENT BUT HIS ABSENCE
5746-48361-0006 WHICH HEROD HAD BUILT AT VAST EXPENSES IN HONOR OF CAESAR AND CALLED SEBASTUS AND NOW WAS ANTIPATER EVIDENTLY IN A MISERABLE CONDITION WHILE NOBODY CAME TO HIM NOR SALUTED HIM AS THEY DID AT HIS GOING AWAY WITH GOOD WISHES OF JOYFUL ACCLAMATIONS
5746-48361-0007 NOR WAS THERE NOW ANY THING TO HINDER THEM FROM ENTERTAINING HIM ON THE CONTRARY WITH BITTER CURSES
5746-48361-0008 BEING SENT TO SUCCEED SATURNINUS AS PRESIDENT OF SYRIA AND WAS COME AS AN ASSESSOR TO HEROD WHO HAD DESIRED HIS ADVICE IN HIS PRESENT AFFAIRS AND AS THEY WERE SITTING TOGETHER ANTIPATER CAME UPON THEM WITHOUT KNOWING ANY THING OF THE MATTER SO HE CAME INTO THE PALACE CLOTHED IN PURPLE
5746-48361-0009 THE PORTERS INDEED RECEIVED HIM IN BUT EXCLUDED HIS FRIENDS AND NOW HE WAS IN GREAT DISORDER AND PRESENTLY UNDERSTOOD THE CONDITION HE WAS IN WHILE UPON HIS GOING TO SALUTE HIS FATHER HE WAS REPULSED BY HIM WHO CALLED HIM A MURDERER OF HIS BRETHREN AND A PLOTTER OF DESTRUCTION AGAINST HIMSELF
5746-48361-0010 AND BESIDES THESE SOME SLAVES OF ANTIPATER'S MOTHER WHO WERE TAKEN UP A LITTLE BEFORE ANTIPATER'S COMING AND BROUGHT WITH THEM A WRITTEN LETTER THE SUM OF WHICH WAS THIS THAT HE SHOULD NOT COME BACK BECAUSE ALL WAS COME TO HIS FATHER'S KNOWLEDGE
5746-48361-0011 AND THAT CAESAR WAS THE ONLY REFUGE HE HAD LEFT TO PREVENT BOTH HIS AND HER DELIVERY INTO HIS FATHER'S HANDS THEN DID ANTIPATER FALL DOWN AT HIS FATHER'S FEET AND BESOUGHT HIM NOT TO PREJUDGE HIS CAUSE
5746-48361-0012 SO HEROD ORDERED HIM TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE MIDST AND THEN LAMENTED HIMSELF ABOUT HIS CHILDREN FROM WHOM HE HAD SUFFERED SUCH GREAT MISFORTUNES AND BECAUSE ANTIPATER FELL UPON HIM IN HIS OLD AGE
5746-48361-0013 HE ALSO RECKONED UP WHAT MAINTENANCE AND WHAT EDUCATION HE HAD GIVEN THEM AND WHAT SEASONABLE SUPPLIES OF WEALTH HE HAD AFFORDED THEM ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN DESIRES NONE OF WHICH FAVORS HAD HINDERED THEM FROM CONTRIVING AGAINST HIM
5746-48361-0014 AND FROM BRINGING HIS VERY LIFE INTO DANGER IN ORDER TO GAIN HIS KINGDOM AFTER AN IMPIOUS MANNER BY TAKING AWAY HIS LIFE BEFORE THE COURSE OF NATURE THEIR FATHER'S WISHES OR JUSTICE REQUIRED THAT THAT KINGDOM SHOULD COME TO THEM
5746-48361-0015 AND THAT HE WONDERED WHAT HOPES COULD ELEVATE ANTIPATER TO SUCH A PASS AS TO BE HARDY ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT SUCH THINGS
5746-48361-0016 EITHER IN HIS ILLUSTRIOUS DIGNITY OR IN POWER AND AUTHORITY
5746-48361-0017 HE ALSO OBJECTED TO HIM THE CASE OF HIS BRETHREN WHOM HE HAD ACCUSED AND IF THEY WERE GUILTY HE HAD IMITATED THEIR EXAMPLE AND IF NOT HE HAD BROUGHT HIM GROUNDLESS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIS NEAR RELATIONS FOR THAT HE HAD BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THOSE THINGS BY HIM
5746-48361-0018 AND BY NOBODY ELSE AND HAD DONE WHAT WAS DONE BY HIS APPROBATION
5746-48361-0019 AND WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS AFFAIRS
5746-48361-0020 FOR THAT HE HAD MADE PROVISION FOR EVERY THING THAT WAS FIT TO BE FORESEEN BEFOREHAND AS TO GIVING HIM HIS WISEST ADVICE AND WHENEVER THERE WAS OCCASION FOR THE LABOR OF HIS OWN HANDS HE HAD NOT GRUDGED ANY SUCH PAINS FOR HIM
5746-48361-0021 AND THAT THERE WAS NO LIKELIHOOD THAT A PERSON WHO HAD THE ONE HALF OF THAT AUTHORITY WITHOUT ANY DANGER AND WITH A GOOD CHARACTER SHOULD HUNT AFTER THE WHOLE WITH INFAMY AND DANGER AND THIS WHEN IT WAS DOUBTFUL WHETHER HE COULD OBTAIN IT OR NOT
5746-48361-0022 AND WHEN HE SAW THE SAD EXAMPLE OF HIS BRETHREN BEFORE HIM AND WAS BOTH THE INFORMER AND THE ACCUSER AGAINST THEM AT A TIME WHEN THEY MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED
5746-48361-0023 NAY WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE PUNISHMENT INFLICTED UPON THEM WHEN IT APPEARED EVIDENTLY THAT THEY WERE GUILTY OF A WICKED ATTEMPT AGAINST THEIR FATHER AND THAT EVEN THE CONTENTIONS THERE WERE IN THE KING'S FAMILY WERE INDICATIONS THAT HE HAD EVER MANAGED AFFAIRS OUT OF THE SINCEREST AFFECTION TO HIS FATHER AND AS TO WHAT HE HAD DONE AT ROME
5746-48361-0024 WHO YET WAS NO MORE TO BE IMPOSED UPON THAN GOD HIMSELF OF WHOSE OPINIONS HIS LETTERS SENT HITHER ARE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AND THAT IT WAS NOT REASONABLE TO PREFER THE CALUMNIES OF SUCH AS PROPOSED TO RAISE DISTURBANCES BEFORE THOSE LETTERS THE GREATEST PART OF WHICH CALUMNIES HAD BEEN RAISED DURING HIS ABSENCE
5746-48361-0025 WHILE THEY GREATLY PITIED ANTIPATER WHO BY WEEPING AND PUTTING ON A COUNTENANCE SUITABLE TO HIS SAD CASE MADE THEM COMMISERATE THE SAME
5746-48361-0026 AND IT APPEARED PLAINLY THAT HEROD HIMSELF WAS AFFECTED IN HIS OWN MIND ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOT WILLING IT SHOULD BE TAKEN NOTICE OF THEN DID NICOLAUS BEGIN TO PROSECUTE WHAT THE KING HAD BEGUN AND THAT WITH GREAT BITTERNESS AND SUMMED UP ALL THE EVIDENCE WHICH AROSE FROM THE TORTURES
5746-48361-0027 OR FROM THE TESTIMONIES HE PRINCIPALLY AND LARGELY CRIED UP THE KING'S VIRTUES WHICH HE HAD EXHIBITED IN THE MAINTENANCE AND EDUCATION OF HIS SONS WHILE HE NEVER COULD GAIN ANY ADVANTAGE THEREBY BUT STILL FELL FROM ONE MISFORTUNE TO ANOTHER
5746-48361-0028 OF ANTIPATER WHO ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT ONLY HAD GREAT BENEFITS BESTOWED ON HIM BY HIS FATHER ENOUGH TO TAME HIS REASON YET COULD NOT BE MORE TAMED THAN THE MOST ENVENOMED SERPENTS WHEREAS EVEN THOSE CREATURES ADMIT OF SOME MITIGATION AND WILL NOT BITE THEIR BENEFACTORS
5746-48361-0029 THE INFORMER AS TO WHAT WICKED ACTIONS THEY HAD DONE AND THE SEARCHER OUT OF THE EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM AND THE AUTHOR OF THE PUNISHMENT THEY UNDERWENT UPON THEIR DETECTION NOR DO WE SAY THIS AS ACCUSING THEE FOR BEING SO ZEALOUS IN THY ANGER AGAINST THEM
5746-48361-0030 THAT BY SUCH OUTSIDE HATRED OF THEIR IMPIETY THOU MIGHTEST BE BELIEVED A LOVER OF THY FATHER AND MIGHTEST THEREBY GET THEE POWER ENOUGH TO DO MISCHIEF WITH THE GREATEST IMPUNITY WHICH DESIGN THY ACTIONS INDEED DEMONSTRATE IT IS TRUE THOU TOOKEST THY BRETHREN OFF
5746-48361-0031 BECAUSE THOU DIDST CONVICT THEFT OF THEIR WICKED DESIGNS BUT THOU DIDST NOT YIELD UP TO JUSTICE THOSE WHO WERE THEIR PARTNERS AND THEREBY DIDST MAKE IT EVIDENT TO ALL MEN THAT THOU MADEST A COVENANT WITH THEM AGAINST THY FATHER WHEN THOU CHOSEST TO BE THE ACCUSER OF THY BRETHREN
5746-48361-0032 AS DESIROUS TO GAIN TO THYSELF ALONE THIS ADVANTAGE OF LAYING PLOTS TO KILL THY FATHER
5746-48361-0033 BUT FOR CERTAIN THOU DIDST NOT MEASURE THESE THINGS ACCORDING TO THY FATHER'S VARIOUS DISPOSITION BUT ACCORDING TO THY OWN THOUGHTS AND INCLINATIONS AND WAS DESIROUS TO TAKE THE PART THAT REMAINED AWAY FROM THY TOO INDULGENT FATHER AND SOUGHTEST TO DESTROY HIM WITH THY DEEDS
5746-48361-0034 WHOM THOU IN WORDS PRETENDEDST TO PRESERVE NOR WAST THOU CONTENT TO BE WICKED THYSELF BUT THOU FILLEDST THY MOTHER'S HEAD WITH THY DEVICES AND RAISED DISTURBANCES AMONG THY BRETHREN AND HADST THE BOLDNESS TO CALL THY FATHER A WILD BEAST
5746-48361-0035 WHILE THOU HADST THYSELF A MIND MORE CRUEL THAN ANY SERPENT
5746-48361-0036 AND INVITEDST THEM TO ASSIST THEE AND GUARD THEE AND DIDST HEDGE THYSELF IN ON ALL SIDES BY THE ARTIFICES OF BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AGAINST AN OLD MAN
5746-48361-0037 AND HERE THOU APPEAREST AFTER THE TORTURES OF FREE MEN OF DOMESTICS OF MEN AND WOMEN WHICH HAVE BEEN EXAMINED ON THY ACCOUNT AND AFTER THE INFORMATIONS OF THY FELLOW CONSPIRATORS AS MAKING HASTE TO CONTRADICT THE TRUTH
5746-48361-0038 THAT THOU DESIREST TO BE PUT TO THE TORTURE THYSELF WHILE THOU ALLEGEST THAT THE TORTURES OF THOSE ALREADY EXAMINED THEREBY
5746-48361-0039 BUT THAT THY TORTURES MAY BE ESTEEMED THE DISCOVERERS OF TRUTH WILT NOT THOU O VARUS DELIVER THE KING FROM THE INJURIES OF HIS KINDRED
5746-48361-0040 WHILE YET HE IS HIMSELF ALONE READY TO CARRY OFF THE KINGDOM IMMEDIATELY AND APPEARS TO BE THE MOST BLOODY BUTCHER TO HIM OF THEM ALL FOR THOU ART SENSIBLE THAT PARRICIDE IS A GENERAL INJURY BOTH TO NATURE AND TO COMMON LIFE
5746-48361-0041 AND WHATSOEVER SHE HAD PRATTLED LIKE A WOMAN AS ALSO ABOUT THE PREDICTIONS AND THE SACRIFICES RELATING TO THE KING AND WHATSOEVER ANTIPATER HAD DONE LASCIVIOUSLY IN HIS CUPS AND HIS AMOURS AMONG PHERORAS'S WOMEN THE EXAMINATION UPON TORTURE
5746-48361-0042 AND WHATSOEVER CONCERNED THE TESTIMONIES OF THE WITNESSES WHICH WERE MANY AND OF VARIOUS KINDS SOME PREPARED BEFOREHAND AND OTHERS WERE SUDDEN ANSWERS WHICH FURTHER DECLARED AND CONFIRMED THE FOREGOING EVIDENCE
5746-48361-0043 FOR THOSE MEN WHO WERE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH ANTIPATER'S PRACTICES BUT HAD CONCEALED THEM OUT OF FEAR WHEN THEY SAW THAT HE WAS EXPOSED TO THE ACCUSATIONS OF THE FORMER WITNESSES AND THAT HIS GREAT GOOD FORTUNE WHICH HAD SUPPORTED HIM HITHERTO
5746-48361-0044 TOLD ALL THEY KNEW OF HIM AND HIS RUIN WAS NOW HASTENED
5746-48361-0045 AS BY HIS GROSS AND IMPUDENT AND WICKED CONTRIVANCES AND BY HIS ILL WILL TO HIS FATHER AND HIS BRETHREN WHILE HE HAD FILLED THEIR HOUSE WITH DISTURBANCE AND CAUSED THEM TO MURDER ONE ANOTHER AND WAS NEITHER FAIR IN HIS HATRED NOR KIND IN HIS FRIENDSHIP BUT JUST SO FAR AS SERVED HIS OWN TURN
5746-48361-0046 NOW THERE WERE A GREAT NUMBER WHO FOR A LONG TIME BEFOREHAND HAD SEEN ALL THIS AND ESPECIALLY SUCH AS WERE NATURALLY DISPOSED TO JUDGE OF MATTERS BY THE RULES OF VIRTUE BECAUSE THEY WERE USED TO DETERMINE ABOUT AFFAIRS WITHOUT PASSION BUT HAD BEEN RESTRAINED FROM MAKING ANY OPEN COMPLAINTS BEFORE
5746-48361-0047 OUT OF SUSPICION OF ANY DANGER THEY WERE IN BUT THEY SPAKE WHAT THEY KNEW BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT SUCH ACTIONS VERY WICKED AND THAT ANTIPATER DESERVED THE GREATEST PUNISHMENT AND INDEED NOT SO MUCH FOR HEROD'S SAFETY AS ON ACCOUNT OF THE MAN'S OWN WICKEDNESS
5746-48361-0048 IF HE HAD PREPARED ANY THING WHEREBY IT MIGHT APPEAR THAT HE WAS NOT GUILTY OF THE CRIMES HE WAS ACCUSED OF FOR THAT
5746-48361-0049 SO DID HE KNOW THAT HIS FATHER WAS IN LIKE MANNER DESIROUS ALSO TO HAVE HIM FOUND ENTIRELY INNOCENT BUT ANTIPATER FELL DOWN ON HIS FACE AND APPEALED TO GOD AND TO ALL MEN FOR TESTIMONIALS OF HIS INNOCENCY DESIRING THAT GOD WOULD DECLARE BY SOME EVIDENT SIGNALS THAT HE HAD NOT LAID ANY PLOT AGAINST HIS FATHER
5746-48361-0050 THIS BEING THE USUAL METHOD OF ALL MEN DESTITUTE OF VIRTUE THAT WHEN THEY SET ABOUT ANY WICKED UNDERTAKINGS THEY FALL TO WORK ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN INCLINATIONS AS IF THEY BELIEVED THAT GOD WAS UNCONCERNED IN HUMAN AFFAIRS
5746-48361-0051 BUT WHEN ONCE THEY ARE FOUND OUT AND ARE IN DANGER OF UNDERGOING THE PUNISHMENT DUE TO THEIR CRIMES THEY ENDEAVOR TO OVERTHROW ALL THE EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM BY APPEALING TO GOD WHICH WAS THE VERY THING WHICH ANTIPATER NOW DID FOR WHEREAS HE HAD DONE EVERYTHING AS IF THERE WERE NO GOD IN THE WORLD
5746-48361-0052 WHEN HE WAS ON ALL SIDES DISTRESSED BY JUSTICE AND WHEN HE HAD NO OTHER ADVANTAGE TO EXPECT FROM ANY LEGAL PROOFS BY WHICH HE MIGHT DISPROVE THE ACCUSATIONS LAID AGAINST HIM HE IMPUDENTLY ABUSED THE MAJESTY OF GOD AND ASCRIBED IT TO HIS POWER THAT HE HAD BEEN PRESERVED HITHERTO
5746-48361-0053 FOUND THAT HE HAD NOTHING TO SAY BESIDES HIS APPEAL TO GOD AND SAW THAT THERE WAS NO END OF THAT HE BID THEM BRING THE POTION BEFORE THE COURT THAT HE MIGHT SEE WHAT VIRTUE STILL REMAINED IN IT
5746-48361-0054 AND WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT AND ONE THAT WAS CONDEMNED TO DIE HAD DRANK IT BY VARUS'S COMMAND HE DIED PRESENTLY THEN VARUS GOT UP AND DEPARTED OUT OF THE COURT AND WENT AWAY THE DAY FOLLOWING TO ANTIOCH WHERE HIS USUAL RESIDENCE WAS BECAUSE THAT WAS THE PALACE OF THE SYRIANS
5746-48361-0055 UPON WHICH HEROD LAID HIS SON IN BONDS BUT WHAT WERE VARUS'S DISCOURSES TO HEROD WAS NOT KNOWN TO THE GENERALITY AND UPON WHAT WORDS IT WAS THAT HE WENT AWAY
5746-48361-0056 BUT WHEN HEROD HAD BOUND HIS SON HE SENT LETTERS TO ROME TO CAESAR ABOUT HIM AND SUCH MESSENGERS WITHAL AS SHOULD BY WORD OF MOUTH INFORM CAESAR OF ANTIPATER'S WICKEDNESS
5746-48361-0057 I WISH THEE GOOD SUCCESS IN THY AFFAIR THESE WERE THE CONTENTS OF THIS LETTER BUT THE KING MADE INQUIRY ABOUT THE OTHER LETTER ALSO FOR IT DID NOT APPEAR
5746-48361-0058 HE GUESSED THAT THE LETTER MIGHT BE WITHIN THAT DOUBLING WHICH ACCORDINGLY PROVED TO BE TRUE SO THEY TOOK OUT THE LETTER AND ITS CONTENTS WERE THESE ACME TO ANTIPATER I HAVE WRITTEN SUCH A LETTER TO THY FATHER AS THOU DESIREDST ME
5746-48361-0059 AND INFORMED HIM THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH HIS COMMAND SHE HAD BOTH HERSELF WRITTEN TO HEROD AS IF SALOME HAD LAID A SUDDEN PLOT ENTIRELY AGAINST HIM AND HAD HERSELF SENT A COPY OF AN EPISTLE AS COMING FROM SALOME TO HER LADY NOW ACME WAS A JEW BY BIRTH AND A SERVANT TO JULIA CAESAR'S WIFE
5746-48361-0060 BEATING HER BREAST AND BIDDING HIM KILL HER IF HE COULD PRODUCE ANY CREDIBLE TESTIMONY THAT SHE HAD ACTED IN THAT MANNER HEROD ALSO SENT FOR HIS SON AND ASKED HIM ABOUT THIS MATTER AND BID HIM CONTRADICT IF HE COULD AND NOT SUPPRESS ANY THING HE HAD TO SAY FOR HIMSELF
5746-48361-0061 AND WHEN HE HAD NOT ONE WORD TO SAY HE ASKED HIM SINCE HE WAS EVERY WAY CAUGHT IN HIS VILLAINY THAT HE WOULD MAKE NO FURTHER DELAY BUT DISCOVER HIS ASSOCIATES IN THESE HIS WICKED DESIGNS
5746-48361-0062 BUT DISCOVERED NOBODY ELSE HEREUPON HEROD WAS IN SUCH GREAT GRIEF THAT HE WAS READY TO SEND HIS SON TO ROME TO CAESAR THERE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THESE HIS WICKED CONTRIVANCES BUT HE SOON BECAME AFRAID LEST HE MIGHT THERE BY THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS FRIENDS
5746-48361-0063 ESCAPE THE DANGER HE WAS IN SO HE KEPT HIM BOUND AS BEFORE AND SENT MORE AMBASSADORS AND LETTERS TO ROME TO ACCUSE HIS SON
