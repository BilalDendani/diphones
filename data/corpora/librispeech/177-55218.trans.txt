177-55218-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE THE CAUSE AND BERTRAM FEBRUARY CAME THE OPERETTA FOR WHICH BILLY WAS WORKING SO HARD WAS TO BE GIVEN THE TWENTIETH THE ART EXHIBITION FOR WHICH BERTRAM WAS PREPARING HIS FOUR PICTURES WAS TO OPEN THE SIXTEENTH
177-55218-0001 WITH A PRIVATE VIEW FOR SPECIALLY INVITED FRIENDS THE EVENING BEFORE ON THE ELEVENTH DAY OF FEBRUARY MISSUS GREGGORY AND HER DAUGHTER ARRIVED AT HILLSIDE FOR A TEN DAYS VISIT NOT UNTIL AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF PLEADING AND ARGUMENT HOWEVER HAD BILLY BEEN ABLE TO BRING THIS ABOUT
177-55218-0002 BUT MY DEARS BOTH OF YOU BILLY HAD AT LAST SAID TO THEM JUST LISTEN WE SHALL HAVE
177-55218-0003 AND WILL HAVE TO STAY ALL NIGHT SEVERAL TIMES PROBABLY YOU MISSUS GREGGORY
177-55218-0004 IT HAD BEEN THE GREAT GOOD AND PLEASURE WHICH THE VISIT WOULD BRING TO MISSUS GREGGORY THAT HAD BEEN THE FINAL STRAW TO TIP THE SCALES ON THE ELEVENTH OF FEBRUARY THEREFORE IN THE COMPANY OF THE ONCE SCORNED PEGGY AND MARY JANE ALICE GREGGORY AND HER MOTHER HAD ARRIVED AT HILLSIDE
177-55218-0005 EVER SINCE THE FIRST MEETING OF ALICE GREGGORY AND ARKWRIGHT BILLY HAD BEEN SORELY TROUBLED BY THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE SHE HAD AS SHE MOURNFULLY TOLD HERSELF
177-55218-0006 THE TWO WERE CIVILITY ITSELF TO EACH OTHER BUT VERY PLAINLY THEY WERE NOT AT EASE IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY AND BILLY MUCH TO HER SURPRISE HAD TO ADMIT THAT ARKWRIGHT DID NOT APPEAR TO APPRECIATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES NOW THAT HE HAD THEM THE PAIR CALLED EACH OTHER CEREMONIOUSLY
177-55218-0007 MISTER ARKWRIGHT AND MISS GREGGORY BUT THEN THAT OF COURSE DID NOT SIGNIFY BILLY DECLARED TO HERSELF I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T EVER CALL HIM MARY JANE SHE SAID TO THE GIRL A LITTLE MISCHIEVOUSLY ONE DAY MARY JANE MISTER ARKWRIGHT NO I DON'T
177-55218-0008 REJOINED MISS GREGGORY WITH AN ODD SMILE THEN AFTER A MOMENT SHE ADDED I BELIEVE HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS USED TO HOWEVER YES I KNOW LAUGHED BILLY WE THOUGHT HE WAS A REAL MARY JANE ONCE AND SHE TOLD THE STORY OF HIS ARRIVAL
177-55218-0009 SO YOU SEE SHE FINISHED WHEN ALICE GREGGORY HAD DONE LAUGHING OVER THE TALE
177-55218-0010 MISS GREGGORY LOOKED UP IN SURPRISE WHY IT'S SHE STOPPED SHORT HER EYES QUESTIONING WHY HASN'T HE EVER TOLD YOU SHE QUERIED BILLY LIFTED HER CHIN NO
177-55218-0011 METHUSELAH JOHN BUT HE SAYS WE HAVEN'T HIT IT YET METHUSELAH JOHN INDEED LAUGHED THE OTHER MERRILY
177-55218-0012 IF IT ISN'T METHUSELAH JOHN WHAT IS IT THEN BUT ALICE GREGGORY SHOOK HER HEAD SHE TOO IT SEEMED COULD BE FIRM ON OCCASION AND THOUGH SHE SMILED BRIGHTLY ALL SHE WOULD SAY WAS IF HE HASN'T TOLD YOU I SHA'N'T YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO HIM
177-55218-0013 OH WELL I CAN STILL CALL HIM MARY JANE RETORTED BILLY WITH AIRY DISDAIN ALL THIS HOWEVER SO FAR AS BILLY COULD SEE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST HELPING ALONG THE CAUSE THAT HAD BECOME SO DEAR TO HER
177-55218-0014 YES THE QUIETLY POLITE MONOSYLLABLE WAS NOT VERY ENCOURAGING TO BE SURE BUT BILLY SECURE IN HER CONVICTION THAT HER CAUSE WAS A RIGHTEOUS ONE REFUSED TO BE DAUNTED I THINK IT WAS SO ROMANTIC
177-55218-0015 THEIR RUNNING ACROSS EACH OTHER LIKE THIS MISSUS GREGGORY SHE MURMURED AND THERE WAS A ROMANCE WASN'T THERE I HAVE JUST FELT IN MY BONES THAT THERE WAS A ROMANCE BILLY HELD HER BREATH IT WAS WHAT SHE HAD MEANT TO SAY BUT NOW THAT SHE HAD SAID IT THE WORDS SEEMED
177-55218-0016 VERY FEARSOME INDEED TO SAY TO MISSUS GREGGORY THEN BILLY REMEMBERED HER CAUSE AND TOOK HEART BILLY WAS SPELLING IT NOW WITH A CAPITAL C FOR A LONG MINUTE MISSUS GREGGORY DID NOT ANSWER FOR SO LONG A MINUTE
177-55218-0017 THAT BILLY'S BREATH DROPPED INTO A FLUTTERING SIGH AND HER CAUSE BECAME SUDDENLY IMPERTINENCE SPELLED IN BLACK CAPITALS THEN MISSUS GREGGORY SPOKE SLOWLY A LITTLE SADLY I DON'T MIND SAYING TO YOU THAT I DID HOPE
177-55218-0018 ONCE THAT THERE WOULD BE A ROMANCE THERE THEY WERE THE BEST OF FRIENDS AND THEY WERE WELL SUITED TO EACH OTHER IN TASTES AND TEMPERAMENT I THINK INDEED THAT THE ROMANCE WAS WELL UNDER WAY THOUGH THERE WAS NEVER AN ENGAGEMENT WHEN MISSUS GREGGORY PAUSED AND WET HER LIPS
177-55218-0019 HER VOICE WHEN SHE RESUMED CARRIED THE STERN NOTE SO FAMILIAR TO BILLY IN HER FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS WOMAN AND HER DAUGHTER AS I PRESUME MISTER ARKWRIGHT HAS TOLD YOU WE HAVE MET WITH MANY CHANGES IN OUR LIFE CHANGES WHICH NECESSITATED A NEW HOME AND A NEW MODE OF LIVING
177-55218-0020 NATURALLY UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES OLD FRIENDS AND OLD ROMANCES MUST CHANGE TOO BUT MISSUS GREGGORY STAMMERED BILLY I'M SURE MISTER ARKWRIGHT WOULD WANT AN UP LIFTED HAND SILENCED HER PEREMPTORILY
177-55218-0021 MISTER ARKWRIGHT WAS VERY KIND AND A GENTLEMAN ALWAYS INTERPOSED THE LADY COLDLY BUT JUDGE GREGGORY'S DAUGHTER WOULD NOT ALLOW HERSELF TO BE PLACED WHERE APOLOGIES FOR HER FATHER WOULD BE NECESSARY EVER THERE PLEASE
177-55218-0022 DEAR MISS NEILSON LET US NOT TALK OF IT ANY MORE BEGGED MISSUS GREGGORY BROKENLY NO INDEED OF COURSE NOT CRIED BILLY BUT HER HEART REJOICED SHE UNDERSTOOD IT ALL NOW
177-55218-0023 ARKWRIGHT AND ALICE GREGGORY HAD BEEN ALMOST LOVERS WHEN THE CHARGES AGAINST THE JUDGE'S HONOR HAD PLUNGED THE FAMILY INTO DESPAIRING HUMILIATION THEN HAD COME THE TIME WHEN ACCORDING TO ARKWRIGHT'S OWN STORY THE TWO WOMEN HAD SHUT THEMSELVES INDOORS REFUSED TO SEE THEIR FRIENDS AND LEFT TOWN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
177-55218-0024 THUS HAD COME THE BREAKING OF WHATEVER TIE THERE WAS BETWEEN ALICE GREGGORY AND ARKWRIGHT NOT TO HAVE BROKEN IT WOULD HAVE MEANT FOR ALICE THE PLACING OF HERSELF IN A POSITION WHERE SOMETIME APOLOGIES MUST BE MADE FOR HER FATHER
177-55218-0025 AND AGAIN AS BILLY THOUGHT OF IT BILLY'S HEART REJOICED
177-55218-0026 DID SHE NOT HAVE IT IN HER POWER POSSIBLY EVEN PROBABLY TO BRING HAPPINESS WHERE ONLY SADNESS WAS BEFORE AS IF IT WOULD NOT BE A SIMPLE THING TO REKINDLE THE OLD FLAME TO MAKE THESE TWO ESTRANGED HEARTS BEAT AS ONE AGAIN
177-55218-0027 NOT NOW WAS THE CAUSE AN IMPERTINENCE IN TALL BLACK LETTERS IT WAS INSTEAD A SHINING BEACON IN LETTERS OF FLAME GUIDING STRAIGHT TO VICTORY
177-55218-0028 BILLY WENT TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT MAKING PLANS FOR ALICE GREGGORY AND ARKWRIGHT TO BE THROWN TOGETHER NATURALLY JUST AS A MATTER OF COURSE YOU KNOW SHE SAID DROWSILY TO HERSELF ALL IN THE DARK SOME THREE OR FOUR MILES AWAY DOWN BEACON STREET AT THAT MOMENT
177-55218-0029 BERTRAM HENSHAW IN THE STRATA WAS AS IT HAPPENED NOT FALLING ASLEEP HE WAS LYING BROADLY AND UNHAPPILY AWAKE BERTRAM VERY FREQUENTLY LAY BROADLY AND UNHAPPILY AWAKE THESE DAYS OR RATHER NIGHTS HE TOLD HIMSELF ON THESE OCCASIONS
177-55218-0030 WITH ARKWRIGHT AND HIS FRIENDS THE GREGGORYS SO MUCH THERE WERE THE NEW SONGS AND THE OPERETTA WITH ITS REHEARSALS AS A CAUSE FOR IT ALL AT THE SAME TIME DEEP WITHIN HIS FEARFUL SOUL WAS THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ARKWRIGHT THE GREGGORYS AND THE OPERETTA WERE BUT
177-55218-0031 MUSIC MUSIC THE SPECTRE THAT FROM THE FIRST HAD DOGGED HIS FOOTSTEPS WITH BILLY'S BEHAVIOR TOWARD HIMSELF BERTRAM COULD FIND NO FAULT SHE WAS ALWAYS HER SWEET LOYAL LOVABLE SELF EAGER TO HEAR OF HIS WORK
177-55218-0032 EARNESTLY SOLICITOUS THAT IT SHOULD BE A SUCCESS SHE EVEN AS HE SOMETIMES HALF IRRITABLY REMEMBERED HAD ONCE TOLD HIM THAT SHE REALIZED HE BELONGED TO ART BEFORE HE DID TO HIMSELF AND WHEN HE HAD INDIGNANTLY DENIED THIS SHE HAD ONLY LAUGHED AND THROWN A KISS AT HIM
177-55218-0033 AS IF HE WANTED KATE'S OPINION ON THAT OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT CONCERNED HIM AND BILLY ONCE TORN BY JEALOUSY AND EXASPERATED AT THE FREQUENT INTERRUPTIONS OF THEIR QUIET HOURS TOGETHER HE HAD COMPLAINED OPENLY ACTUALLY BILLY IT'S WORSE THAN MARIE'S WEDDING HE DECLARED
177-55218-0034 BILLY LAUGHED BUT SHE FROWNED TOO I KNOW DEAR I DON'T LIKE THAT PART I WISH THEY WOULD LET ME ALONE WHEN I'M WITH YOU BUT AS FOR THE OPERETTA IT IS REALLY A GOOD THING DEAR AND YOU'LL SAY SO WHEN YOU SEE IT
177-55218-0035 I CAN SAY THAT BECAUSE MY PART IS ONLY A SMALL ONE YOU KNOW WE SHALL MAKE LOTS OF MONEY FOR THE HOME TOO I'M SURE BUT YOU'RE WEARING YOURSELF ALL OUT WITH IT DEAR SCOWLED BERTRAM
177-55218-0036 BESIDES WHEN I'M DOING THIS I'M NOT TELEPHONING YOU TO COME AND AMUSE ME
177-55218-0037 AVOWED BERTRAM BUT THE WORK MAY RETORTED BILLY SHOWING ALL HER DIMPLES
177-55218-0038 THIS ISN'T AN UNDERSTUDY LIKE MARIE'S WEDDING YOU KNOW SHE FINISHED DEMURELY THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT BERTRAM HAD BREATHED FERVENTLY BUT EVEN AS HE SAID THE WORDS HE GREW SICK WITH FEAR WHAT IF AFTER ALL THIS WERE AN UNDERSTUDY TO WHAT WAS TO COME LATER WHEN MUSIC
177-55218-0039 HIS RIVAL HAD REALLY CONQUERED BERTRAM KNEW THAT HOWEVER SECURE MIGHT SEEM BILLY'S AFFECTION FOR HIMSELF THERE WAS STILL IN HIS OWN MIND A HORRID FEAR LEST UNDERNEATH THAT SECURITY WERE AN UNCONSCIOUS
177-55218-0040 SOME ONE THAT HE WAS NOT A FONDNESS THAT WOULD ONE DAY CAUSE BILLY TO AWAKE
