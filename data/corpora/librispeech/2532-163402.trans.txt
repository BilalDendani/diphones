2532-163402-0000 BECAUSE TOM SAID WE GOT TO HAVE SOME LIGHT TO SEE HOW TO DIG BY AND A LANTERN MAKES TOO MUCH AND MIGHT GET US INTO TROUBLE WHAT WE MUST HAVE WAS A LOT OF THEM ROTTEN CHUNKS THAT'S CALLED FOX FIRE AND JUST MAKES A SOFT KIND OF A GLOW WHEN YOU LAY THEM IN A DARK PLACE
2532-163402-0001 WE FETCHED AN ARMFUL AND HID IT IN THE WEEDS AND SET DOWN TO REST AND TOM SAYS KIND OF DISSATISFIED BLAME IT THIS WHOLE THING IS JUST AS EASY AND AWKWARD AS IT CAN BE
2532-163402-0002 THERE AIN'T NO WATCHMAN TO BE DRUGGEDNOW THERE OUGHT TO BE A WATCHMAN THERE AIN'T EVEN A DOG TO GIVE A SLEEPING MIXTURE TO AND THERE'S JIM CHAINED BY ONE LEG WITH A TEN FOOT CHAIN TO THE LEG OF HIS BED
2532-163402-0003 AND UNCLE SILAS HE TRUSTS EVERYBODY SENDS THE KEY TO THE PUNKIN HEADED NIGGER AND DON'T SEND NOBODY TO WATCH THE NIGGER
2532-163402-0004 JIM COULD A GOT OUT OF THAT WINDOW HOLE BEFORE THIS ONLY THERE WOULDN'T BE NO USE TRYING TO TRAVEL WITH A TEN FOOT CHAIN ON HIS LEG WHY DRAT IT HUCK IT'S THE STUPIDEST ARRANGEMENT I EVER SEE YOU GOT TO INVENT ALL THE DIFFICULTIES
2532-163402-0005 AND YOU HAD TO CONTRIVE THEM ALL OUT OF YOUR OWN HEAD NOW LOOK AT JUST THAT ONE THING OF THE LANTERN WHEN YOU COME DOWN TO THE COLD FACTS WE SIMPLY GOT TO LET ON THAT A LANTERN'S RESKY
2532-163402-0006 WHY WE COULD WORK WITH A TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION IF WE WANTED TO I BELIEVE NOW WHILST I THINK OF IT WE GOT TO HUNT UP SOMETHING TO MAKE A SAW OUT OF THE FIRST CHANCE WE GET WHAT DO WE WANT OF A SAW
2532-163402-0007 BARON TRENCK NOR CASANOVA NOR BENVENUTO CHELLEENY
2532-163402-0008 NO THE WAY ALL THE BEST AUTHORITIES DOES IS TO SAW THE BED LEG IN TWO AND LEAVE IT JUST SO
2532-163402-0009 AND SWALLOW THE SAWDUST SO IT CAN'T BE FOUND AND PUT SOME DIRT AND GREASE AROUND THE SAWED PLACE SO THE VERY KEENEST SENESKAL CAN'T SEE NO SIGN OF IT'S BEING SAWED AND THINKS THE BED LEG IS PERFECTLY SOUND THEN THE NIGHT YOU'RE READY FETCH THE LEG A KICK
2532-163402-0010 DOWN SHE GOES SLIP OFF YOUR CHAIN AND THERE YOU ARE NOTHING TO DO BUT HITCH YOUR ROPE LADDER TO THE BATTLEMENTS SHIN DOWN IT BREAK YOUR LEG IN THE MOATBECAUSE A ROPE LADDER IS NINETEEN FOOT TOO SHORT YOU KNOWAND
2532-163402-0011 IT'S GAUDY HUCK I WISH THERE WAS A MOAT TO THIS CABIN IF WE GET TIME THE NIGHT OF THE ESCAPE WE'LL DIG ONE I SAYS WHAT DO WE WANT OF A MOAT WHEN WE'RE GOING TO SNAKE HIM OUT FROM UNDER THE CABIN BUT HE NEVER HEARD ME
2532-163402-0012 HE HAD FORGOT ME AND EVERYTHING ELSE HE HAD HIS CHIN IN HIS HAND THINKING PRETTY SOON HE SIGHS AND SHAKES HIS HEAD THEN SIGHS AGAIN AND SAYS
2532-163402-0013 AIN'T NECESSITY ENOUGH FOR IT FOR WHAT I SAYS
2532-163402-0014 WHY THERE AIN'T NO NECESSITY FOR IT AND WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO SAW HIS LEG OFF FOR ANYWAY WELL SOME OF THE BEST AUTHORITIES HAS DONE IT THEY COULDN'T GET THE CHAIN OFF SO THEY JUST CUT THEIR HAND OFF AND SHOVED AND A LEG WOULD BE BETTER STILL BUT WE GOT TO LET THAT GO
2532-163402-0015 THERE AIN'T NECESSITY ENOUGH IN THIS CASE AND BESIDES JIM'S A NIGGER AND WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE REASONS FOR IT AND HOW IT'S THE CUSTOM IN EUROPE SO WE'LL LET IT GO BUT THERE'S ONE THINGHE
2532-163402-0016 WHY TOM SAWYER HOW YOU TALK I SAYS JIM AIN'T GOT NO USE FOR A ROPE LADDER HE HAS GOT USE FOR IT HOW YOU TALK YOU BETTER SAY YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
2532-163402-0017 THEY ALL DO WHAT IN THE NATION CAN HE DO WITH IT DO WITH IT HE CAN HIDE IT IN HIS BED CAN'T HE THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL DO AND HE'S GOT TO TOO
2532-163402-0018 AND DON'T YOU RECKON THEY'LL WANT CLEWS OF COURSE THEY WILL AND YOU WOULDN'T LEAVE THEM ANY
2532-163402-0019 WELL I SAYS
2532-163402-0020 BECAUSE I DON'T WISH TO GO BACK ON NO REGULATIONS
2532-163402-0021 WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO TROUBLE WITH AUNT SALLY JUST AS SURE AS YOU'RE BORN NOW THE WAY I LOOK AT IT A HICKRY BARK LADDER DON'T COST NOTHING AND DON'T WASTE NOTHING
2532-163402-0022 WELL ALL RIGHT TOM FIX IT YOUR OWN WAY BUT IF YOU'LL TAKE MY ADVICE YOU'LL LET ME BORROW A SHEET OFF OF THE CLOTHESLINE HE SAID THAT WOULD DO AND THAT GAVE HIM ANOTHER IDEA AND HE SAYS BORROW A SHIRT TOO WHAT DO WE WANT OF A SHIRT TOM
2532-163402-0023 S'POSE HE CAN'T WRITEHE
2532-163402-0024 WHY TOM WE CAN PULL A FEATHER OUT OF A GOOSE AND MAKE HIM A BETTER ONE AND QUICKER TOO
2532-163402-0025 THEY WOULDN'T USE A GOOSE QUILL IF THEY HAD IT IT
2532-163402-0026 MANY MAKES IT OUT OF IRON RUST AND TEARS BUT THAT'S THE COMMON SORT AND WOMEN THE BEST AUTHORITIES USES THEIR OWN BLOOD JIM CAN DO THAT
2532-163402-0027 AND WHEN HE WANTS TO SEND ANY LITTLE COMMON ORDINARY MYSTERIOUS MESSAGE TO LET THE WORLD KNOW WHERE HE'S CAPTIVATED
2532-163402-0028 THE IRON MASK ALWAYS DONE THAT AND IT'S A BLAME GOOD WAY TOO JIM AIN'T GOT NO TIN PLATES THEY FEED HIM IN A PAN THAT AIN'T NOTHING WE CAN GET HIM SOME CAN'T NOBODY READ HIS PLATES
2532-163402-0029 THAT AIN'T GOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT HUCK FINN ALL HE'S GOT TO DO IS TO WRITE ON THE PLATE AND THROW IT OUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ABLE TO READ IT
2532-163402-0030 WHY HALF THE TIME YOU CAN'T READ ANYTHING A PRISONER WRITES ON A TIN PLATE OR ANYWHERE ELSE WELL THEN WHAT'S THE SENSE IN WASTING THE PLATES
2532-163402-0031 BUT IT'S SOMEBODY'S PLATES AIN'T IT WELL SPOS'N IT IS WHAT DOES THE PRISONER CARE WHOSE HE BROKE OFF THERE BECAUSE WE HEARD THE BREAKFAST HORN BLOWING SO WE CLEARED OUT FOR THE HOUSE
2532-163402-0032 ALONG DURING THE MORNING I BORROWED A SHEET AND A WHITE SHIRT OFF OF THE CLOTHES LINE AND I FOUND AN OLD SACK AND PUT THEM IN IT AND WE WENT DOWN AND GOT THE FOX FIRE AND PUT THAT IN TOO I CALLED IT BORROWING
2532-163402-0033 IT WAS STEALING HE SAID WE WAS REPRESENTING PRISONERS AND PRISONERS DON'T CARE HOW THEY GET A THING SO THEY GET IT AND NOBODY DON'T BLAME THEM FOR IT EITHER
2532-163402-0034 HE SAID IF WE WARN'T PRISONERS IT WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT THING AND NOBODY BUT A MEAN ORNERY PERSON WOULD STEAL WHEN HE WARN'T A PRISONER SO WE ALLOWED WE WOULD STEAL EVERYTHING THERE WAS THAT COME HANDY
2532-163402-0035 TOM SAID THAT WHAT HE MEANT WAS WE COULD STEAL ANYTHING WE NEEDED WELL I SAYS I NEEDED THE WATERMELON BUT HE SAID I DIDN'T NEED IT TO GET OUT OF PRISON WITH
2532-163402-0036 HE SAID IF I'D A WANTED IT TO HIDE A KNIFE IN AND SMUGGLE IT TO JIM TO KILL THE SENESKAL WITH IT WOULD A BEEN ALL RIGHT
2532-163402-0037 WELL AS I WAS SAYING WE WAITED THAT MORNING TILL EVERYBODY WAS SETTLED DOWN TO BUSINESS AND NOBODY IN SIGHT AROUND THE YARD THEN TOM HE CARRIED THE SACK INTO THE LEAN TO WHILST I STOOD OFF A PIECE TO KEEP WATCH
2532-163402-0038 WHY TO DIG WITH WE AIN'T A GOING TO GNAW HIM OUT ARE WE AIN'T THEM OLD CRIPPLED PICKS AND THINGS IN THERE GOOD ENOUGH TO DIG A NIGGER OUT WITH I SAYS HE TURNS ON ME LOOKING PITYING ENOUGH TO MAKE A BODY CRY AND SAYS
2532-163402-0039 WELL THEN I SAYS IF WE DON'T WANT THE PICKS AND SHOVELS WHAT DO WE WANT A COUPLE OF CASE KNIVES TO DIG THE FOUNDATIONS OUT FROM UNDER THAT CABIN WITH YES
2532-163402-0040 CONFOUND IT IT'S FOOLISH TOM IT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE HOW FOOLISH IT IS IT'S THE RIGHT WAYAND IT'S THE REGULAR WAY
2532-163402-0041 AND IT TAKES THEM WEEKS AND WEEKS AND WEEKS AND FOR EVER AND EVER WHY LOOK AT ONE OF THEM PRISONERS IN THE BOTTOM DUNGEON OF THE CASTLE DEEF
2532-163402-0042 I WISH THE BOTTOM OF THIS FORTRESS WAS SOLID ROCK JIM DON'T KNOW NOBODY IN CHINA WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH IT
2532-163402-0043 WHY CAN'T YOU STICK TO THE MAIN POINT
2532-163402-0044 SO HE COMES OUT AND JIM DON'T EITHER I RECKON BUT THERE'S ONE THING ANYWAY JIM'S TOO OLD TO BE DUG OUT WITH A CASE KNIFE
2532-163402-0045 HE WON'T LAST YES HE WILL LAST TOO YOU DON'T RECKON IT'S GOING TO TAKE THIRTY SEVEN YEARS TO DIG OUT THROUGH A DIRT FOUNDATION DO YOU HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TOM WELL WE CAN'T RESK BEING AS LONG AS WE OUGHT TO
2532-163402-0046 BECAUSE IT MAYN'T TAKE VERY LONG FOR UNCLE SILAS TO HEAR FROM DOWN THERE BY NEW ORLEANS HE'LL HEAR JIM AIN'T FROM THERE THEN HIS NEXT MOVE WILL BE TO ADVERTISE JIM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO WE CAN'T RESK BEING AS LONG DIGGING HIM OUT AS WE OUGHT TO
2532-163402-0047 BY RIGHTS I RECKON WE OUGHT TO BE A COUPLE OF YEARS BUT WE CAN'T THINGS BEING SO UNCERTAIN WHAT I RECOMMEND IS THIS THAT WE REALLY DIG RIGHT IN AS QUICK AS WE CAN AND AFTER THAT WE CAN LET
2532-163402-0048 THEN WE CAN SNATCH HIM OUT AND RUSH HIM AWAY THE FIRST TIME THERE'S AN ALARM YES
2532-163402-0049 NOW THERE'S SENSE IN THAT I SAYS LETTING ON DON'T COST NOTHING LETTING ON AIN'T NO TROUBLE AND IF IT'S ANY OBJECT I DON'T MIND LETTING ON WE WAS AT IT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEAR
2532-163402-0050 IT WOULDN'T STRAIN ME NONE AFTER I GOT MY HAND IN SO I'LL MOSEY ALONG NOW AND SMOUCH A COUPLE OF CASE KNIVES SMOUCH THREE HE SAYS WE WANT ONE TO MAKE A SAW OUT OF TOM
2532-163402-0051 THERE'S AN OLD RUSTY SAW BLADE AROUND YONDER STICKING UNDER THE WEATHER BOARDING BEHIND THE SMOKE HOUSE
