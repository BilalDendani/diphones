4705-94473-0000 IS THAT THESE FACULTIES ALWAYS WORK UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SOMETHING WHICH STIMULATES THEM AND THIS STIMULUS MAY COME EITHER FROM WITHOUT THROUGH THE EXTERNAL SENSES OR FROM WITHIN BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOMETHING NOT PERCEPTIBLE ON THE PHYSICAL PLANE
4705-94473-0001 NOW THE RECOGNITION OF THESE INTERIOR SOURCES OF STIMULUS TO OUR MENTAL FACULTIES IS AN IMPORTANT BRANCH OF MENTAL SCIENCE BECAUSE THE MENTAL ACTION THUS SET UP WORKS JUST AS ACCURATELY THROUGH THE PHYSICAL CORRESPONDENCES
4705-94473-0002 AS THOSE WHICH START FROM THE RECOGNITION OF EXTERNAL FACTS AND THEREFORE THE CONTROL AND RIGHT DIRECTION OF THESE INNER PERCEPTIONS IS A MATTER OF THE FIRST MOMENT THE FACULTIES MOST IMMEDIATELY CONCERNED ARE THE INTUITION AND THE IMAGINATION
4705-94473-0003 BUT IT IS AT FIRST DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW THE INTUITION WHICH IS ENTIRELY SPONTANEOUS CAN BE BROUGHT UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE WILL OF COURSE THE SPONTANEOUSNESS OF THE INTUITION CANNOT IN ANY WAY BE INTERFERED WITH FOR IF IT CEASED TO ACT SPONTANEOUSLY
4705-94473-0004 AND THEREFORE FOR IT TO CEASE TO ACT SPONTANEOUSLY WOULD BE FOR IT TO CEASE TO ACT AT ALL BUT THE EXPERIENCE OF A LONG SUCCESSION OF OBSERVERS
4705-94473-0005 AND THE CHOICE OF THE GENERAL DIRECTION IS DETERMINED BY THE WILL OF THE INDIVIDUAL IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THE INTUITION WORKS MOST READILY IN RESPECT TO THOSE SUBJECTS WHICH MOST HABITUALLY OCCUPY OUR THOUGHT
4705-94473-0006 AND ACCORDING TO THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CORRESPONDENCES WHICH WE HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING THIS MIGHT BE ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE PHYSICAL PLANE BY THE FORMATION OF BRAIN CHANNELS SPECIALLY ADAPTED FOR THE INDUCTION
4705-94473-0007 IN THE MOLECULAR SYSTEM OF VIBRATIONS CORRESPONDING TO THE PARTICULAR CLASS OF IDEAS IN QUESTION BUT OF COURSE WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THE IDEAS THEMSELVES ARE NOT CAUSED BY THE MOLECULAR CHANGES BUT ON THE CONTRARY ARE THE CAUSE OF THEM
4705-94473-0008 AND IT IS IN THIS TRANSLATION OF THOUGHT ACTION INTO PHYSICAL ACTION THAT WE ARE BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH THE ETERNAL MYSTERY OF THE DESCENT OF SPIRIT INTO MATTER AND THAT THOUGH WE MAY TRACE MATTER THROUGH SUCCESSIVE DEGREES OF REFINEMENT TILL IT BECOMES WHAT
4705-94473-0009 HOWEVER DELICATELY ETHERIC THE SUBSTANCE ITS MOVEMENT COMMENCES BY THE VIBRATION OF ITS PARTICLES AND A VIBRATION IS A WAVE HAVING A CERTAIN LENGTH AMPLITUDE AND PERIODICITY
4705-94473-0010 AND AS SOON AS WE ARE DEALING WITH ANYTHING CAPABLE OF THE CONCEPTION OF MEASUREMENT WE MAY BE QUITE CERTAIN THAT WE ARE NOT DEALING WITH SPIRIT BUT ONLY WITH ONE OF ITS VEHICLES THEREFORE ALTHOUGH WE MAY PUSH OUR ANALYSIS OF MATTER FURTHER AND EVER FURTHER BACK
4705-94473-0011 THEREFORE WE MUST NOT ATTRIBUTE THE ORIGINATION OF IDEAS TO MOLECULAR DISPLACEMENT IN THE BRAIN THOUGH BY THE REACTION OF THE PHYSICAL UPON THE MENTAL WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN OF ABOVE THE FORMATION OF THOUGHT CHANNELS IN THE GREY MATTER OF THE BRAIN
4705-94473-0012 MAY TEND TO FACILITATE THE RECEPTION OF CERTAIN IDEAS SOME PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY CONSCIOUS OF THE ACTION OF THE UPPER PORTION OF THE BRAIN DURING THE INFLUX OF AN INTUITION THE SENSATION BEING THAT OF A SORT OF EXPANSION IN THAT BRAIN AREA
4705-94473-0013 WHICH MIGHT BE COMPARED TO THE OPENING OF A VALVE OR DOOR BUT ALL ATTEMPTS TO INDUCE THE INFLOW OF INTUITIVE IDEAS
4705-94473-0014 SHOULD BE DISCOURAGED AS LIKELY TO PROVE INJURIOUS TO THE BRAIN I BELIEVE SOME ORIENTAL SYSTEMS ADVOCATE THIS METHOD BUT WE MAY WELL TRUST THE MIND TO REGULATE THE ACTION OF ITS PHYSICAL CHANNELS IN A MANNER SUITABLE TO ITS OWN REQUIREMENTS
4705-94473-0015 THE FACT HOWEVER REMAINS THAT THE INTUITION WORKS MOST FREELY IN THAT DIRECTION IN WHICH WE MOST HABITUALLY CONCENTRATE OUR THOUGHT AND IN PRACTICE IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THE BEST WAY TO CULTIVATE THE INTUITION IN ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION
4705-94473-0016 IS TO MEDITATE UPON THE ABSTRACT PRINCIPLES OF THAT PARTICULAR CLASS OF SUBJECTS RATHER THAN ONLY TO CONSIDER PARTICULAR CASES PERHAPS THE REASON IS THAT PARTICULAR CASES HAVE TO DO WITH SPECIFIC PHENOMENA THAT IS WITH THE LAW WORKING UNDER CERTAIN LIMITING CONDITIONS
4705-94473-0017 WHEREAS THE PRINCIPLES OF THE LAW ARE NOT LIMITED BY LOCAL CONDITIONS AND SO HABITUAL MEDITATION ON THEM SETS OUR INTUITION FREE TO RANGE IN AN INFINITUDE WHERE THE CONCEPTION OF ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS DOES NOT LIMIT IT
4705-94473-0018 ANYWAY WHATEVER MAY BE THE THEORETICAL EXPLANATION YOU WILL FIND THAT THE CLEAR GRASP OF ABSTRACT PRINCIPLES IN ANY DIRECTION HAS A WONDERFULLY QUICKENING EFFECT UPON THE INTUITION IN THAT PARTICULAR DIRECTION
4705-94473-0019 THE IMPORTANCE OF RECOGNIZING OUR POWER OF THUS GIVING DIRECTION TO THE INTUITION CANNOT BE EXAGGERATED FOR IF THE MIND IS ATTUNED TO SYMPATHY WITH THE HIGHEST PHASES OF SPIRIT THIS POWER OPENS THE DOOR TO LIMITLESS POSSIBILITIES OF KNOWLEDGE
4705-94473-0020 IN ITS HIGHEST WORKINGS INTUITION BECOMES INSPIRATION AND CERTAIN GREAT RECORDS OF FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS AND SUPREME MYSTERIES WHICH HAVE COME DOWN TO US FROM THOUSANDS OF GENERATIONS BEQUEATHED BY DEEP THINKERS OF OLD
4705-94473-0021 COUPLED WITH A REVERENT WORSHIP OF IT OPENED THE DOOR THROUGH THEIR INTUITIVE FACULTY TO THE MOST SUBLIME INSPIRATIONS REGARDING THE SUPREME TRUTHS OF THE UNIVERSE BOTH WITH RESPECT TO THE EVOLUTION OF THE COSMOS
4705-94473-0022 AMONG SUCH RECORDS EXPLANATORY OF THE SUPREME MYSTERIES THREE STAND OUT PRE EMINENT ALL BEARING WITNESS TO THE SAME ONE TRUTH AND EACH THROWING LIGHT UPON THE OTHER AND THESE THREE ARE THE BIBLE THE GREAT PYRAMID
4705-94473-0023 AND THE PACK OF CARDS A CURIOUS COMBINATION SOME WILL THINK BUT I HOPE IN ANOTHER VOLUME OF THIS SERIES TO BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY MY PRESENT STATEMENT I ALLUDE TO THESE THREE RECORDS HERE BECAUSE THE UNITY OF PRINCIPLE WHICH THEY EXHIBIT
4705-94473-0024 VERY CLOSELY ALLIED TO THE INTUITION IS THE FACULTY OF IMAGINATION THIS DOES NOT MEAN MERE FANCIES WHICH WE DISMISS WITHOUT FURTHER CONSIDERATION BUT OUR POWER OF FORMING MENTAL IMAGES UPON WHICH WE DWELL THESE
4705-94473-0025 AS I HAVE SAID IN THE EARLIER PART OF THIS BOOK FORM A NUCLEUS WHICH ON ITS OWN PLANE CALLS INTO ACTION THE UNIVERSAL LAW OF ATTRACTION THUS GIVING RISE TO THE PRINCIPLE OF GROWTH THE RELATION OF THE INTUITION TO THE IMAGINATION
4705-94473-0026 IS THAT THE INTUITION GRASPS AN IDEA FROM THE GREAT UNIVERSAL MIND IN WHICH ALL THINGS SUBSIST AS POTENTIALS AND PRESENTS IT TO THE IMAGINATION IN ITS ESSENCE RATHER THAN IN A DEFINITE FORM AND THEN OUR IMAGE BUILDING FACULTY GIVES IT A CLEAR AND DEFINITE FORM
4705-94473-0027 WHICH IT PRESENTS BEFORE THE MENTAL VISION AND WHICH WE THEN VIVIFY BY LETTING OUR THOUGHT DWELL UPON IT THUS INFUSING OUR OWN PERSONALITY INTO IT AND SO PROVIDING THAT PERSONAL ELEMENT THROUGH WHICH THE SPECIFIC ACTION OF THE UNIVERSAL LAW
4705-94473-0028 DEPENDS ON OUR OWN WILL AND OUR EXERCISE OF OUR WILL DEPENDS ON OUR BELIEF IN OUR POWER TO USE IT SO AS TO DISPERSE OR CONSOLIDATE A GIVEN MENTAL IMAGE AND FINALLY OUR BELIEF IN OUR POWER TO DO THIS
4705-94473-0029 DEPENDS ON OUR RECOGNITION OF OUR RELATION TO GOD WHO IS THE SOURCE OF ALL POWER FOR IT IS AN INVARIABLE TRUTH THAT OUR LIFE WILL TAKE ITS WHOLE FORM TONE AND COLOR FROM OUR CONCEPTION OF GOD WHETHER THAT CONCEPTION BE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
4705-94473-0030 AND THE SEQUENCE BY WHICH IT DOES SO IS THAT NOW GIVEN IN THIS WAY THEN OUR INTUITION IS RELATED TO OUR IMAGINATION AND THIS RELATION HAS ITS PHYSIOLOGICAL CORRESPONDENCE
4705-94473-0031 WHICH HAVING ITS COMMENCEMENT IN THE HIGHER OR IDEAL PORTION OF THE BRAIN FLOWS THROUGH THE VOLUNTARY NERVOUS SYSTEM THE PHYSICAL CHANNEL OF OBJECTIVE MIND RETURNING THROUGH THE SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM THE PHYSICAL CHANNEL OF SUBJECTIVE MIND
4705-94473-0032 THUS COMPLETING THE CIRCUIT AND BEING THEN RESTORED TO THE FRONTAL BRAIN WHERE IT IS CONSCIOUSLY MODELLED INTO CLEAR CUT FORMS SUITED TO A SPECIFIC PURPOSE IN ALL THIS THE POWER OF THE WILL AS REGULATING THE ACTION BOTH OF THE INTUITION AND THE IMAGINATION
4705-94473-0033 MUST NEVER BE LOST SIGHT OF FOR WITHOUT SUCH A CENTRAL CONTROLLING POWER WE SHOULD LOSE ALL SENSE OF INDIVIDUALITY AND HENCE THE ULTIMATE AIM OF THE EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS
4705-94473-0034 IS TO EVOLVE INDIVIDUAL WILLS ACTUATED BY SUCH BENEFICENCE AND ENLIGHTENMENT AS SHALL MAKE THEM FITTING VEHICLES FOR THE OUTFLOWING OF THE SUPREME SPIRIT WHICH HAS HITHERTO CREATED COSMICALLY AND CAN NOW CARRY ON THE CREATIVE PROCESS TO ITS HIGHEST STAGES
4705-94473-0035 ONLY THROUGH CONSCIOUS UNION WITH THE INDIVIDUAL FOR THIS IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF THE GREAT PROBLEM HOW CAN THE UNIVERSAL MIND ACT IN ALL ITS FULNESS UPON THE PLANE OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND PARTICULAR
4705-94473-0036 THIS IS THE ULTIMATE OF EVOLUTION AND THE SUCCESSFUL EVOLUTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL DEPENDS ON HIS RECOGNIZING THIS ULTIMATE AND WORKING TOWARDS IT
