5136-53512-0000 THERE IS THE SLOW DELIBERATE MANNER IN USING WHICH
5136-53512-0001 AND TO PROVE THAT THE DESIRE TO BORROW SHOWS NO IMPRUDENCE ON HIS OWN PART
5136-53512-0002 IT MAY BE SAID THAT THIS MODE FAILS OFTENER THAN ANY OTHER THERE IS THE PITEOUS MANNER THE PLEA FOR COMMISERATION MY DEAR FELLOW UNLESS YOU WILL SEE ME THROUGH NOW UPON MY WORD I SHALL BE VERY BADLY OFF
5136-53512-0003 AND THIS MANNER MAY BE DIVIDED AGAIN INTO TWO THERE IS THE PLEA PITEOUS WITH A LIE AND THE PLEA PITEOUS WITH A TRUTH YOU SHALL HAVE IT AGAIN IN TWO MONTHS AS SURE AS THE SUN RISES THAT IS GENERALLY THE PLEA PITEOUS WITH A LIE
5136-53512-0004 OR IT MAY BE AS FOLLOWS IT IS ONLY FAIR TO SAY THAT I DON'T QUITE KNOW WHEN I CAN PAY IT BACK THIS IS THE PLEA PITEOUS WITH A TRUTH AND UPON THE WHOLE I THINK THAT THIS IS GENERALLY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MODE OF BORROWING
5136-53512-0005 AND THERE IS THE ASSURED DEMAND WHICH BETOKENS A CLOSE INTIMACY OLD FELLOW CAN YOU LET ME HAVE THIRTY POUNDS NO JUST PUT YOUR NAME THEN ON THE BACK OF THIS AND I'LL GET IT DONE IN THE CITY THE WORST OF THAT MANNER IS
5136-53512-0006 THAT THE BILL SO OFTEN DOES NOT GET ITSELF DONE IN THE CITY THEN THERE IS THE SUDDEN ATTACK THAT BEING THE MANNER TO WHICH CROSBIE HAD RECOURSE IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE THAT THERE ARE OTHER MODES OF BORROWING
5136-53512-0007 BY MEANS OF WHICH YOUTH BECOMES INDEBTED TO AGE AND LOVE TO RESPECT AND IGNORANCE TO EXPERIENCE IS A MATTER OF COURSE
5136-53512-0008 I HAVE COME TO YOU IN GREAT DISTRESS SAID CROSBIE I WONDER WHETHER YOU CAN HELP ME
5136-53512-0009 MISTER BUTTERWELL WHEN HE HEARD THE WORDS DROPPED THE PAPER WHICH HE WAS READING FROM HIS HAND AND STARED AT CROSBIE OVER HIS SPECTACLES FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS HE SAID
5136-53512-0010 DEAR ME CROSBIE THAT'S A LARGE SUM OF MONEY YES IT IS A VERY LARGE SUM HALF THAT IS WHAT I WANT AT ONCE BUT I SHALL WANT THE OTHER HALF IN A MONTH I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE ALWAYS SO MUCH ABOVE THE WORLD IN MONEY MATTERS
5136-53512-0011 I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT YOU HAD YOUR THINGS SO VERY SNUG CROSBIE WAS AWARE THAT HE HAD MADE ONE VERY GREAT STEP TOWARDS SUCCESS THE IDEA HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO MISTER BUTTERWELL'S MIND
5136-53512-0012 AS AN IDEA TO WHICH NO RECEPTION COULD BE GIVEN FOR A MOMENT CROSBIE HAD NOT BEEN TREATED AS WAS THE NEEDY KNIFE GRINDER
5136-53512-0013 I HAVE BEEN SO PRESSED SINCE MY MARRIAGE HE SAID
5136-53512-0014 BUT LADY ALEXANDRINA YES OF COURSE I KNOW I
5136-53512-0015 BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT I AM ONLY NOW FREE FROM THE
5136-53512-0016 YOU WOULD HARDLY BELIEVE ME IF I TOLD YOU WHAT I'VE HAD TO PAY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE POUNDS FOR BRINGING HER BODY OVER HERE
5136-53512-0017 AND SO WOULD I YOU DON'T SUPPOSE I ORDERED IT TO BE DONE POOR DEAR THING IF IT COULD DO HER ANY GOOD GOD KNOWS I WOULD NOT BEGRUDGE IT
5136-53512-0018 I HAD TO PAY HIS TRAVELLING BILL TOO HE DIDN'T COME TO BE BURIED DID HE IT'S TOO DISGUSTING TO TALK OF BUTTERWELL IT IS INDEED AND WHEN I ASKED FOR HER MONEY THAT WAS SETTLED UPON ME IT WAS ONLY TWO THOUSAND POUNDS
5136-53512-0019 THEY MADE ME GO TO LAW AND IT SEEMS THERE WAS NO TWO THOUSAND POUNDS TO SETTLE IF I LIKE I CAN HAVE ANOTHER LAWSUIT WITH THE SISTERS WHEN THE MOTHER IS DEAD
5136-53512-0020 I HAVE MADE SUCH A FOOL OF MYSELF I HAVE COME TO SUCH SHIPWRECK OH BUTTERWELL IF YOU COULD BUT KNOW IT ALL
5136-53512-0021 I OWE GAZEBEE THE MAN WHO MARRIED THE OTHER WOMAN OVER A THOUSAND POUNDS BUT I PAY THAT OFF AT TWO HUNDRED A YEAR AND HE HAS A POLICY ON MY LIFE WHAT DO YOU OWE THAT FOR DON'T ASK ME
5136-53512-0022 NOT THAT I MIND TELLING YOU FURNITURE AND THE LEASE OF A HOUSE AND HIS BILL FOR THE MARRIAGE SETTLEMENT
5136-53512-0023 A MAN DOESN'T MARRY AN EARL'S DAUGHTER FOR NOTHING BUTTERWELL AND THEN TO THINK WHAT I LOST IT CAN'T BE HELPED NOW YOU KNOW
5136-53512-0024 I HATE TO HEAR A MAN TALK LIKE THAT I DON'T MEAN THAT I SHALL I'M TOO MUCH OF A COWARD I FANCY A MAN WHO DESIRES TO SOFTEN ANOTHER MAN'S HEART SHOULD ALWAYS ABUSE HIMSELF IN SOFTENING A WOMAN'S HEART
5136-53512-0025 I HAVEN'T HAD AN HOUR OF COMFORT NOT AN HOUR I DON'T KNOW WHY I SHOULD TROUBLE YOU WITH ALL THIS BUTTERWELL
5136-53512-0026 THAT'S JUST HOW I STAND I OWED GAZEBEE SOMETHING OVER A THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH IS ARRANGED AS I HAVE TOLD YOU
5136-53512-0027 AT LEAST SOME OF THEM WERE I SUPPOSE AND THAT HORRID GHASTLY FUNERAL AND DEBTS I DON'T DOUBT DUE BY THE CURSED OLD COUNTESS
5136-53512-0028 I RAISED SOMETHING OVER FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS AND NOW I OWE FIVE WHICH MUST BE PAID PART TO MORROW AND THE REMAINDER THIS DAY MONTH AND YOU'VE NO SECURITY
5136-53512-0029 NOT A RAG NOT A SHRED NOT A LINE NOT AN ACRE THERE'S MY SALARY AND AFTER PAYING GAZEBEE WHAT COMES DUE TO HIM
5136-53512-0030 AND WITHOUT ANY SECURITY I KNOW BUTTERWELL THAT I'VE NO RIGHT TO ASK FOR IT I FEEL THAT OF COURSE I SHOULD PAY YOU WHAT INTEREST YOU PLEASE MONEY'S ABOUT SEVEN NOW SAID BUTTERWELL
5136-53512-0031 I'VE NOT THE SLIGHTEST OBJECTION TO SEVEN PER CENT SAID CROSBIE BUT THAT'S ON SECURITY SAID BUTTERWELL YOU CAN NAME YOUR OWN TERMS SAID CROSBIE
5136-53512-0032 MISTER BUTTERWELL GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR AND WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS HE WAS THINKING AT THAT MOMENT WHAT MISSUS BUTTERWELL WOULD SAY TO HIM WILL AN ANSWER DO TO MORROW MORNING HE SAID
5136-53512-0033 I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE IT TO DAY SAID CROSBIE
5136-53512-0034 SAID BUTTERWELL FIVE PER CENT IS THE PROPER THING YOU'D
5136-53512-0035 THEY WERE GENUINE TEARS WHICH FILLED CROSBIE'S EYES AS HE SEIZED HOLD OF THE SENIOR'S HANDS BUTTERWELL HE SAID WHAT AM I TO SAY TO YOU NOTHING AT ALL NOTHING AT ALL
5136-53512-0036 YOUR KINDNESS MAKES ME FEEL THAT I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE COME TO YOU
5136-53512-0037 I PROMISED OPTIMIST I WOULD READ THEM BEFORE THREE AND IT'S PAST TWO NOW
5136-53512-0038 AND CROSBIE FELT THAT HE WAS BOUND TO LEAVE THE ROOM
5136-53512-0039 DID NOT READ THE PAPERS WHICH THOMPSON BROUGHT HIM BUT SAT INSTEAD THINKING OF HIS FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS
5136-53512-0040 FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS
5136-53512-0041 HE SAID TO HIMSELF BUT WHERE SHOULD I BE IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO HIM AND THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT MISSUS BUTTERWELL ESPECIALLY DISLIKED MISTER CROSBIE DISLIKED HIM BECAUSE SHE KNEW THAT HE SNUBBED HER HUSBAND
5136-53512-0042 BUT IT'S HARD TO REFUSE WHEN ONE MAN HAS KNOWN ANOTHER FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS THEN HE COMFORTED HIMSELF SOMEWHAT WITH THE REFLECTION THAT CROSBIE WOULD NO DOUBT MAKE HIMSELF MORE PLEASANT FOR THE FUTURE THAN HE HAD DONE LATELY AND WITH A SECOND REFLECTION
5136-53512-0043 THAT CROSBIE'S LIFE WAS A GOOD LIFE AND WITH A THIRD AS TO HIS OWN GREAT GOODNESS IN ASSISTING A BROTHER OFFICER NEVERTHELESS AS HE SAT LOOKING OUT OF THE OMNIBUS WINDOW ON HIS JOURNEY HOME TO PUTNEY
5136-53512-0044 HE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER COMFORTABLE IN HIS MIND MISSUS BUTTERWELL WAS A VERY PRUDENT WOMAN BUT CROSBIE WAS VERY COMFORTABLE IN HIS MIND ON THAT AFTERNOON HE HAD HARDLY DARED TO HOPE FOR SUCCESS BUT HE HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL
5136-53512-0045 HE HAD NOT EVEN THOUGHT OF BUTTERWELL AS A POSSIBLE FOUNTAIN OF SUPPLY TILL HIS MIND HAD BEEN BROUGHT BACK TO THE AFFAIRS OF HIS OFFICE BY THE VOICE OF SIR RAFFLE BUFFLE AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET THE IDEA THAT HIS BILL WOULD BE DISHONOURED AND THAT
5136-53512-0046 TIDINGS OF HIS INSOLVENCY WOULD BE CONVEYED TO THE COMMISSIONERS AT HIS BOARD HAD BEEN DREADFUL TO HIM THE WAY IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN TREATED BY MUSSELBORO AND DOBBS BROUGHTON HAD MADE HIM HATE CITY MEN AND WHAT HE SUPPOSED TO BE CITY WAYS
5136-53512-0047 HE COULD ALMOST THINK OF MISTER MORTIMER GAZEBEE WITHOUT DISGUST PERHAPS AFTER ALL THERE MIGHT BE SOME HAPPINESS YET IN STORE FOR HIM
5136-53512-0048 IF EVER HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF PLEADING HIS OWN CAUSE WITH HER HE CERTAINLY WOULD TELL HER EVERYTHING RESPECTING HIS OWN MONEY DIFFICULTIES IN THAT LAST RESOLVE I THINK WE MAY SAY THAT HE WAS RIGHT
5136-53512-0049 IF LILY WOULD EVER LISTEN TO HIM AGAIN AT ALL
