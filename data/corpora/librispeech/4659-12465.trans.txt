4659-12465-0000 HE HAD HIM IN THE GREATEST HONOR AND TAUGHT HIM THE LEARNING THAT BECAME A FREE MAN AND GAVE HIM LEAVE TO MAKE USE OF A DIET BETTER THAN WAS ALLOTTED TO SLAVES HE INTRUSTED ALSO THE CARE OF HIS HOUSE TO HIM SO HE ENJOYED THESE ADVANTAGES
4659-12465-0001 YET DID NOT HE LEAVE THAT VIRTUE WHICH HE HAD BEFORE UPON SUCH A CHANGE OF HIS CONDITION
4659-12465-0002 BOTH ON ACCOUNT OF HIS BEAUTY OF BODY AND HIS DEXTEROUS MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS AND SUPPOSED THAT IF SHE SHOULD MAKE IT KNOWN TO HIM SHE COULD EASILY PERSUADE HIM TO COME AND LIE WITH HER AND THAT HE WOULD LOOK UPON IT AS A PIECE OF HAPPY FORTUNE THAT HIS MISTRESS SHOULD ENTREAT HIM AS REGARDING THAT STATE OF SLAVERY HE WAS IN
4659-12465-0003 WHICH HE THOUGHT MIGHT BE CONQUERED IF SHE HAD NO HOPE OF SUCCEEDING AND HE SAID THAT AS TO HIMSELF HE WOULD ENDURE ANY THING WHATEVER BEFORE HE WOULD BE PERSUADED TO IT FOR ALTHOUGH IT WAS FIT FOR A SLAVE AS HE WAS TO DO NOTHING CONTRARY TO HIS MISTRESS
4659-12465-0004 HE MIGHT WELL BE EXCUSED IN A CASE WHERE THE CONTRADICTION WAS TO SUCH SORT OF COMMANDS ONLY BUT THIS OPPOSITION OF JOSEPH WHEN SHE DID NOT EXPECT IT MADE HER STILL MORE VIOLENT IN HER LOVE TO HIM AND AS SHE WAS SORELY BESET WITH THIS NAUGHTY PASSION
4659-12465-0005 IN WHICH IT WAS THE CUSTOM FOR WOMEN TO COME TO THE PUBLIC SOLEMNITY SHE PRETENDED TO HER HUSBAND THAT SHE WAS SICK AS CONTRIVING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOLITUDE AND LEISURE THAT SHE MIGHT ENTREAT JOSEPH AGAIN WHICH OPPORTUNITY BEING OBTAINED SHE USED MORE KIND WORDS TO HIM THAN BEFORE
4659-12465-0006 BY WHICH SHE WAS FORCED THOUGH SHE WERE HIS MISTRESS TO CONDESCEND BENEATH HER DIGNITY BUT THAT HE MAY NOW BY TAKING MORE PRUDENT ADVICE WIPE OFF THE IMPUTATION OF HIS FORMER FOLLY FOR WHETHER IT WERE THAT HE EXPECTED THE REPETITION OF HER SOLICITATIONS SHE HAD NOW MADE
4659-12465-0007 AND THAT WITH GREATER EARNESTNESS THAN BEFORE FOR THAT SHE HAD PRETENDED SICKNESS ON THIS VERY ACCOUNT AND HAD PREFERRED HIS CONVERSATION BEFORE THE FESTIVAL AND ITS SOLEMNITY OR WHETHER HE OPPOSED HER FORMER DISCOURSES AS NOT BELIEVING SHE COULD BE IN EARNEST
4659-12465-0008 AND PREFERRED THE REPUTATION OF CHASTITY BEFORE HIS MISTRESS FOR THAT HE WOULD GAIN NOTHING BY SUCH PROCEDURE BECAUSE SHE WOULD THEN BECOME HIS ACCUSER AND WOULD FALSELY PRETEND TO HER HUSBAND THAT HE HAD ATTEMPTED HER CHASTITY AND THAT POTIPHAR WOULD HEARKEN TO HER WORDS RATHER THAN TO HIS
4659-12465-0009 AND EVEN WITH TEARS IN HER EYES NEITHER DID PITY DISSUADE JOSEPH FROM HIS CHASTITY NOR DID FEAR COMPEL HIM TO A COMPLIANCE WITH HER BUT HE OPPOSED HER SOLICITATIONS AND DID NOT YIELD TO HER THREATENINGS AND WAS AFRAID TO DO AN ILL THING
4659-12465-0010 AND CHOSE TO UNDERGO THE SHARPEST PUNISHMENT RATHER THAN TO ENJOY HIS PRESENT ADVANTAGES BY DOING WHAT HIS OWN CONSCIENCE KNEW WOULD JUSTLY DESERVE THAT HE SHOULD DIE FOR IT HE ALSO PUT HER IN MIND THAT SHE WAS A MARRIED WOMAN AND THAT SHE OUGHT TO COHABIT WITH HER HUSBAND ONLY
4659-12465-0011 HE ALSO SUGGESTED TO HER THE FEAR SHE WOULD BE IN LEST THEY SHOULD BE CAUGHT AND THAT THE ADVANTAGE OF CONCEALMENT WAS UNCERTAIN AND THAT ONLY WHILE THE WICKEDNESS WAS NOT KNOWN WOULD THERE BE ANY QUIET FOR THEM
4659-12465-0012 BUT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE THE ENJOYMENT OF HER HUSBAND'S COMPANY WITHOUT ANY DANGER AND HE TOLD HER THAT IN THE COMPANY OF HER HUSBAND SHE MIGHT HAVE GREAT BOLDNESS FROM A GOOD CONSCIENCE BOTH BEFORE GOD AND BEFORE MEN NAY THAT SHE WOULD ACT BETTER LIKE HIS MISTRESS
4659-12465-0013 AND TO REDUCE HER AFFECTIONS WITHIN THE RULES OF REASON BUT SHE GREW MORE UNGOVERNABLE AND EARNEST IN THE MATTER AND SINCE SHE DESPAIRED OF PERSUADING HIM SHE LAID HER HANDS UPON HIM AND HAD A MIND TO FORCE HIM BUT AS SOON AS JOSEPH HAD GOT AWAY FROM HER ANGER
4659-12465-0014 AND SHE THOUGHT IT A WISE THING IN ITSELF AND ALSO BECOMING A WOMAN THUS TO PREVENT HIS ACCUSATION ACCORDINGLY SHE SAT SORROWFUL AND IN CONFUSION FRAMING HERSELF SO HYPOCRITICALLY AND ANGRILY THAT THE SORROW WHICH WAS REALLY FOR HER BEING DISAPPOINTED OF HER LUST
4659-12465-0015 UNLESS HE IN EVERY RESPECT CARRY HIMSELF IN A MANNER AGREEABLE TO US THIS MAN I SAY LAID A PRIVATE DESIGN TO ABUSE THY WIFE AND THIS AT THE TIME OF A FESTIVAL OBSERVING WHEN THOU WOULDST BE ABSENT
4659-12465-0016 WAS ONLY BECAUSE OF THE RESTRAINT HE WAS IN OUT OF FEAR OF THEE BUT THAT HE WAS NOT REALLY OF A GOOD DISPOSITION THIS HAS BEEN OCCASIONED BY HIS BEING ADVANCED TO HONOR BEYOND WHAT HE DESERVED AND WHAT HE HOPED FOR
4659-12465-0017 INSOMUCH THAT HE CONCLUDED THAT HE WHO WAS DEEMED FIT TO BE TRUSTED WITH THY ESTATE AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THY FAMILY AND WAS PREFERRED ABOVE THY ELDEST SERVANTS MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO TOUCH THY WIFE ALSO THUS WHEN SHE HAD ENDED HER DISCOURSE
4659-12465-0018 SHE SHOWED HIM HIS GARMENT AS IF HE THEN LEFT IT WITH HER WHEN HE ATTEMPTED TO FORCE HER BUT POTIPHAR NOT BEING ABLE TO DISBELIEVE WHAT HIS WIFE'S TEARS SHOWED AND WHAT HIS WIFE SAID AND WHAT HE SAW HIMSELF AND BEING SEDUCED BY HIS LOVE TO HIS WIFE
4659-12465-0019 AND BARE HER WITNESS THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN OF A BECOMING MODESTY AND CHASTITY CHAPTER FIVE
4659-12465-0020 AND THE TRUTH OF THE FACT WOULD BE MORE POWERFUL THAN THOSE THAT INFLICTED THE PUNISHMENTS UPON HIM
4659-12465-0021 HE ALSO PERMITTED HIM TO MAKE USE OF A DIET BETTER THAN THAT OF THE REST OF THE PRISONERS NOW AS HIS FELLOW PRISONERS WHEN THEIR HARD LABORS WERE OVER FELL TO DISCOURSING ONE AMONG ANOTHER AS IS USUAL IN SUCH AS ARE EQUAL SUFFERERS
4659-12465-0022 AND TO INQUIRE ONE OF ANOTHER WHAT WERE THE OCCASIONS OF THEIR BEING CONDEMNED TO A PRISON AMONG THEM THE KING'S CUPBEARER AND ONE THAT HAD BEEN RESPECTED BY HIM WAS PUT IN BONDS UPON THE KING'S ANGER AT HIM THIS MAN WAS UNDER THE SAME BONDS WITH JOSEPH
4659-12465-0023 LARGE ALREADY AND RIPE FOR GATHERING AND THAT HE SQUEEZED THEM INTO A CUP WHICH THE KING HELD IN HIS HAND AND WHEN HE HAD STRAINED THE WINE HE GAVE IT TO THE KING TO DRINK AND THAT HE RECEIVED IT FROM HIM WITH A PLEASANT COUNTENANCE THIS HE SAID WAS WHAT HE SAW
4659-12465-0024 FOR HE LET HIM KNOW THAT GOD BESTOWS THE FRUIT OF THE VINE UPON MEN FOR GOOD WHICH WINE IS POURED OUT TO HIM AND IS THE PLEDGE OF FIDELITY AND MUTUAL CONFIDENCE AMONG MEN AND PUTS AN END TO THEIR QUARRELS TAKES AWAY PASSION AND GRIEF OUT OF THE MINDS OF THEM THAT USE IT AND MAKES THEM CHEERFUL
4659-12465-0025 THOU SAYEST THAT THOU DIDST SQUEEZE THIS WINE FROM THREE CLUSTERS OF GRAPES WITH THINE HANDS AND THAT THE KING RECEIVED IT KNOW THEREFORE THAT THIS VISION IS FOR THY GOOD
4659-12465-0026 AND FORETELLS A RELEASE FROM THY PRESENT DISTRESS WITHIN THE SAME NUMBER OF DAYS AS THE BRANCHES HAD WHENCE THOU GATHEREDST THY GRAPES IN THY SLEEP HOWEVER REMEMBER WHAT PROSPERITY I HAVE FORETOLD THEE WHEN THOU HAST FOUND IT TRUE BY EXPERIENCE AND WHEN THOU ART IN AUTHORITY
4659-12465-0027 DO NOT OVERLOOK US IN THIS PRISON WHEREIN THOU WILT LEAVE US WHEN THOU ART GONE TO THE PLACE WE HAVE FORETOLD FOR WE ARE NOT IN PRISON FOR ANY CRIME BUT FOR THE SAKE OF OUR VIRTUE AND SOBRIETY ARE WE CONDEMNED TO SUFFER THE PENALTY OF MALEFACTORS
4659-12465-0028 AND BECAUSE WE ARE NOT WILLING TO INJURE HIM THAT HAS THUS DISTRESSED US THOUGH IT WERE FOR OUR OWN PLEASURE THE CUPBEARER THEREFORE AS WAS NATURAL TO DO REJOICED TO HEAR SUCH AN INTERPRETATION OF HIS DREAM
4659-12465-0029 AND HE EXPECTED A PREDICTION LIKE TO THAT OF THE CUPBEARER BUT JOSEPH CONSIDERING AND REASONING ABOUT THE DREAM SAID TO HIM THAT HE WOULD WILLINGLY BE AN INTERPRETER OF GOOD EVENTS TO HIM AND NOT OF SUCH AS HIS DREAM DENOUNCED TO HIM BUT HE TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD ONLY THREE DAYS IN ALL TO LIVE
4659-12465-0030 FOR THAT THE THREE BASKETS SIGNIFY THAT ON THE THIRD DAY HE SHOULD BE CRUCIFIED AND DEVOURED BY FOWLS WHILE HE WAS NOT ABLE TO HELP HIMSELF NOW BOTH THESE DREAMS HAD THE SAME SEVERAL EVENTS THAT JOSEPH FORETOLD THEY SHOULD HAVE AND THIS TO BOTH THE PARTIES
4659-12465-0031 FOR ON THE THIRD DAY BEFORE MENTIONED WHEN THE KING SOLEMNIZED HIS BIRTH DAY HE CRUCIFIED THE CHIEF BAKER BUT SET THE BUTLER FREE FROM HIS BONDS
4659-12465-0032 AFTER HE HAD ENDURED HIS BONDS TWO YEARS AND HAD RECEIVED NO ASSISTANCE FROM THE CUPBEARER WHO DID NOT REMEMBER WHAT HE HAD SAID TO HIM FORMERLY AND GOD CONTRIVED THIS METHOD OF DELIVERANCE FOR HIM PHARAOH THE KING HAD SEEN IN HIS SLEEP THE SAME EVENING TWO VISIONS
4659-12465-0033 AND AFTER THEM HAD THE INTERPRETATIONS OF THEM BOTH GIVEN HIM HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE LATTER BUT RETAINED THE DREAMS THEMSELVES BEING THEREFORE TROUBLED AT WHAT HE HAD SEEN FOR IT SEEMED TO HIM TO BE ALL OF A MELANCHOLY NATURE
4659-12465-0034 CAME INTO THE MIND OF THE KING'S CUPBEARER WHEN HE SAW THE CONFUSION THAT PHARAOH WAS IN SO HE CAME AND MENTIONED JOSEPH TO HIM AS ALSO THE VISION HE HAD SEEN IN PRISON AND HOW THE EVENT PROVED AS HE HAD SAID AS ALSO THAT THE CHIEF BAKER WAS CRUCIFIED ON THE VERY SAME DAY
4659-12465-0035 AND THAT THIS ALSO HAPPENED TO HIM ACCORDING TO THE INTERPRETATION OF JOSEPH THAT JOSEPH HIMSELF WAS LAID IN BONDS BY POTIPHAR WHO WAS HIS HEAD COOK AS A SLAVE BUT HE SAID HE WAS ONE OF THE NOBLEST OF THE STOCK OF THE HEBREWS AND SAID FURTHER
4659-12465-0036 HIS FATHER LIVED IN GREAT SPLENDOR IF THEREFORE THOU WILT SEND FOR HIM AND NOT DESPISE HIM ON THE SCORE OF HIS MISFORTUNES THOU WILT LEARN WHAT THY DREAMS SIGNIFY SO THE KING COMMANDED THAT THEY SHOULD BRING JOSEPH INTO HIS PRESENCE
4659-12465-0037 AND THOSE WHO RECEIVED THE COMMAND CAME AND BROUGHT HIM WITH THEM HAVING TAKEN CARE OF HIS HABIT THAT IT MIGHT BE DECENT
4659-12465-0038 AND BEING IN DISORDER AND CONSIDERING WITH MYSELF WHAT THIS APPEARANCE SHOULD BE I FELL ASLEEP AGAIN AND SAW ANOTHER DREAM MUCH MORE WONDERFUL THAN THE FOREGOING WHICH STILL DID MORE AFFRIGHT AND DISTURB ME I SAW SEVEN EARS OF CORN GROWING OUT OF ONE ROOT
4659-12465-0039 HAVING THEIR HEADS BORNE DOWN BY THE WEIGHT OF THE GRAINS AND BENDING DOWN WITH THE FRUIT WHICH WAS NOW RIPE AND FIT FOR REAPING AND NEAR THESE I SAW SEVEN OTHER EARS OF CORN MEAGER AND WEAK FOR WANT OF RAIN WHICH FELL TO EATING AND CONSUMING THOSE THAT WERE FIT FOR REAPING
4659-12465-0040 IF THOU THEREFORE CAREFULLY DISPOSE OF THE PLENTIFUL CROPS WHICH WILL COME IN THE FORMER YEARS
4659-12465-0041 AND ASKED HIM BY WHAT MEANS HE MIGHT SO DISPENSE THE FOREGOING PLENTIFUL CROPS IN THE HAPPY YEARS AS TO MAKE THE MISERABLE CROPS MORE TOLERABLE JOSEPH THEN ADDED THIS HIS ADVICE TO SPARE THE GOOD CROPS AND NOT PERMIT THE EGYPTIANS TO SPEND THEM LUXURIOUSLY
4659-12465-0042 HE ALSO EXHORTED HIM TO TAKE THE CORN OF THE HUSBANDMEN AND GIVE THEM ONLY SO MUCH AS WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR THEIR FOOD ACCORDINGLY PHARAOH BEING SURPRISED AT JOSEPH NOT ONLY FOR HIS INTERPRETATION OF THE DREAM BUT FOR THE COUNSEL HE HAD GIVEN HIM INTRUSTED HIM WITH DISPENSING THE CORN
4659-12465-0043 WITH POWER TO DO WHAT HE THOUGHT WOULD BE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE OF EGYPT AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE KING
