3006-5698-0000 CHAPTER SIX PECUNIARY CANONS OF TASTE THE CAUTION HAS ALREADY BEEN REPEATED MORE THAN ONCE
3006-5698-0001 THAT WHILE THE REGULATING NORM OF CONSUMPTION IS IN LARGE PART THE REQUIREMENT OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE IT MUST NOT BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MOTIVE ON WHICH THE CONSUMER ACTS IN ANY GIVEN CASE IS THIS PRINCIPLE IN ITS BALD UNSOPHISTICATED FORM
3006-5698-0002 ORDINARILY HIS MOTIVE IS A WISH TO CONFORM TO ESTABLISHED USAGE TO AVOID UNFAVORABLE NOTICE AND COMMENT TO LIVE UP TO THE ACCEPTED CANONS OF DECENCY IN THE KIND AMOUNT AND GRADE OF GOODS CONSUMED
3006-5698-0003 ESPECIALLY AS REGARDS CONSUMPTION CARRIED ON UNDER THE EYES OF OBSERVERS BUT A CONSIDERABLE ELEMENT OF PRESCRIPTIVE EXPENSIVENESS IS OBSERVABLE ALSO IN CONSUMPTION THAT DOES NOT IN ANY APPRECIABLE DEGREE BECOME KNOWN TO OUTSIDERS
3006-5698-0004 AS FOR INSTANCE ARTICLES OF UNDERCLOTHING SOME ARTICLES OF FOOD
3006-5698-0005 IN ALL SUCH USEFUL ARTICLES A CLOSE SCRUTINY WILL DISCOVER CERTAIN FEATURES WHICH ADD TO THE COST AND ENHANCE THE COMMERCIAL VALUE OF THE GOODS IN QUESTION BUT DO NOT PROPORTIONATELY INCREASE THE SERVICEABILITY OF THESE ARTICLES FOR THE MATERIAL PURPOSES
3006-5698-0006 WHICH ALONE THEY OSTENSIBLY ARE DESIGNED TO SERVE UNDER THE SELECTIVE SURVEILLANCE OF THE LAW OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE THERE GROWS UP A CODE OF ACCREDITED CANONS OF CONSUMPTION THE EFFECT OF WHICH IS TO HOLD THE CONSUMER UP TO A STANDARD OF EXPENSIVENESS AND WASTEFULNESS
3006-5698-0007 IN HIS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AND IN HIS EMPLOYMENT OF TIME AND EFFORT THIS GROWTH OF PRESCRIPTIVE USAGE HAS AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT UPON ECONOMIC LIFE
3006-5698-0008 OF WHAT IS GOOD AND RIGHT IN LIFE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS ALSO IN THE ORGANIC COMPLEX OF HABITS OF THOUGHT WHICH MAKE UP THE SUBSTANCE OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S CONSCIOUS LIFE THE ECONOMIC INTEREST DOES NOT LIE ISOLATED AND DISTINCT FROM ALL OTHER INTERESTS
3006-5698-0009 SOMETHING FOR INSTANCE HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID OF ITS RELATION TO THE CANONS OF REPUTABILITY THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE GUIDES THE FORMATION OF HABITS OF THOUGHT AS TO WHAT IS HONEST AND REPUTABLE IN LIFE AND IN COMMODITIES
3006-5698-0010 IN SO DOING THIS PRINCIPLE WILL TRAVERSE OTHER NORMS OF CONDUCT WHICH DO NOT PRIMARILY HAVE TO DO WITH THE CODE OF PECUNIARY HONOR BUT WHICH HAVE DIRECTLY OR INCIDENTALLY AN ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE OF SOME MAGNITUDE
3006-5698-0011 SO THE CANON OF HONORIFIC WASTE MAY IMMEDIATELY OR REMOTELY INFLUENCE THE SENSE OF DUTY THE SENSE OF BEAUTY THE SENSE OF UTILITY THE SENSE OF DEVOTIONAL OR RITUALISTIC FITNESS AND THE SCIENTIFIC SENSE OF TRUTH
3006-5698-0012 OR THE PARTICULAR MANNER IN WHICH THE CANON OF HONORIFIC EXPENDITURE HABITUALLY TRAVERSES THE CANONS OF MORAL CONDUCT THE MATTER IS ONE WHICH HAS RECEIVED LARGE ATTENTION AND ILLUSTRATION AT THE HANDS OF THOSE WHOSE OFFICE IT IS TO WATCH AND ADMONISH WITH RESPECT TO ANY DEPARTURES
3006-5698-0013 FROM THE ACCEPTED CODE OF MORALS IN MODERN COMMUNITIES WHERE THE DOMINANT ECONOMIC AND LEGAL FEATURE OF THE COMMUNITY'S LIFE IS THE INSTITUTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY ONE OF THE SALIENT FEATURES OF THE CODE OF MORALS IS THE SACREDNESS OF PROPERTY
3006-5698-0014 THERE NEEDS NO INSISTENCE OR ILLUSTRATION TO GAIN ASSENT TO THE PROPOSITION THAT THE HABIT OF HOLDING PRIVATE PROPERTY INVIOLATE IS TRAVERSED BY THE OTHER HABIT OF SEEKING WEALTH FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOOD REPUTE TO BE GAINED THROUGH ITS CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION
3006-5698-0015 MOST OFFENSES AGAINST PROPERTY ESPECIALLY OFFENSES OF AN APPRECIABLE MAGNITUDE COME UNDER THIS HEAD IT IS ALSO A MATTER OF COMMON NOTORIETY AND BYWORD THAT IN OFFENSES WHICH RESULT IN A LARGE ACCESSION OF PROPERTY TO THE OFFENDER
3006-5698-0016 HE DOES NOT ORDINARILY INCUR THE EXTREME PENALTY OR THE EXTREME OBLOQUY WITH WHICH HIS OFFENSES WOULD BE VISITED ON THE GROUND OF THE NAIVE MORAL CODE ALONE THE THIEF OR SWINDLER WHO HAS GAINED GREAT WEALTH BY HIS DELINQUENCY
3006-5698-0017 HAS A BETTER CHANCE THAN THE SMALL THIEF OF ESCAPING THE RIGOROUS PENALTY OF THE LAW AND SOME GOOD REPUTE ACCRUES TO HIM FROM HIS INCREASED WEALTH AND FROM HIS SPENDING THE IRREGULARLY ACQUIRED POSSESSIONS IN A SEEMLY MANNER
3006-5698-0018 A WELL BRED EXPENDITURE OF HIS BOOTY ESPECIALLY APPEALS WITH GREAT EFFECT TO PERSONS OF A CULTIVATED SENSE OF THE PROPRIETIES AND GOES FAR TO MITIGATE THE SENSE OF MORAL TURPITUDE WITH WHICH HIS DERELICTION IS VIEWED BY THEM IT MAY BE NOTED ALSO
3006-5698-0019 THAT WE ARE ALL INCLINED TO CONDONE AN OFFENSE AGAINST PROPERTY IN THE CASE OF A MAN WHOSE MOTIVE IS THE WORTHY ONE OF PROVIDING THE MEANS OF A DECENT MANNER OF LIFE FOR HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN IF IT IS ADDED THAT THE WIFE HAS BEEN NURTURED IN THE LAP OF LUXURY
3006-5698-0020 AS IS DEMANDED BY THE STANDARD OF PECUNIARY DECENCY IN SUCH A CASE THE HABIT OF APPROVING THE ACCUSTOMED DEGREE OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE TRAVERSES THE HABIT OF DEPRECATING VIOLATIONS OF OWNERSHIP TO THE EXTENT EVEN OF SOMETIMES LEAVING THE AWARD
3006-5698-0021 OF PRAISE OR BLAME UNCERTAIN THIS IS PECULIARLY TRUE WHERE THE DERELICTION INVOLVES AN APPRECIABLE PREDATORY OR PIRATICAL ELEMENT THIS TOPIC NEED SCARCELY BE PURSUED FURTHER HERE
3006-5698-0022 BUT THE REMARK MAY NOT BE OUT OF PLACE THAT ALL THAT CONSIDERABLE BODY OF MORALS THAT CLUSTERS ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF AN INVIOLABLE OWNERSHIP IS ITSELF A PSYCHOLOGICAL PRECIPITATE OF THE TRADITIONAL MERITORIOUSNESS OF WEALTH
3006-5698-0023 AND IT SHOULD BE ADDED THAT THIS WEALTH WHICH IS HELD SACRED IS VALUED PRIMARILY FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOOD REPUTE TO BE GOT THROUGH ITS CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION
3006-5698-0024 ALSO AS REGARDS THE SENSE OF DEVOUT OR RITUAL MERIT AND ADEQUACY IN THIS CONNECTION LITTLE NEED BE SAID IN THIS PLACE THAT TOPIC WILL ALSO COME UP INCIDENTALLY IN A LATER CHAPTER STILL
3006-5698-0025 AND THE BEARING OF THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE UPON SOME OF THE COMMONPLACE DEVOUT OBSERVANCES AND CONCEITS MAY THEREFORE BE POINTED OUT OBVIOUSLY THE CANON OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR A GREAT PORTION OF WHAT MAY BE CALLED DEVOUT CONSUMPTION AS E G
3006-5698-0026 THE SACRED BUILDINGS AND THE OTHER PROPERTIES OF THE CULT ARE CONSTRUCTED AND DECORATED WITH SOME VIEW TO A REPUTABLE DEGREE OF WASTEFUL EXPENDITURE AND IT NEEDS BUT LITTLE EITHER OF OBSERVATION OR INTROSPECTION AND EITHER WILL SERVE THE TURN
3006-5698-0027 WITH WHICH ANY EVIDENCE OF INDIGENCE OR SQUALOR ABOUT THE SACRED PLACE AFFECTS ALL BEHOLDERS
3006-5698-0028 THAN THE DWELLING HOUSES OF THE CONGREGATION THIS IS TRUE OF NEARLY ALL DENOMINATIONS AND CULTS WHETHER CHRISTIAN OR PAGAN BUT IT IS TRUE IN A PECULIAR DEGREE OF THE OLDER AND MATURER CULTS
3006-5698-0029 AT THE SAME TIME THE SANCTUARY COMMONLY CONTRIBUTES LITTLE IF ANYTHING TO THE PHYSICAL COMFORT OF THE MEMBERS INDEED THE SACRED STRUCTURE NOT ONLY SERVES THE PHYSICAL WELL BEING OF THE MEMBERS TO BUT A SLIGHT EXTENT AS COMPARED WITH THEIR HUMBLER DWELLING HOUSES
3006-5698-0030 BUT IT IS FELT BY ALL MEN THAT A RIGHT AND ENLIGHTENED SENSE OF THE TRUE THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE GOOD DEMANDS THAT IN ALL EXPENDITURE ON THE SANCTUARY ANYTHING THAT MIGHT SERVE THE COMFORT OF THE WORSHIPPER SHOULD BE CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT IF ANY ELEMENT OF COMFORT IS ADMITTED IN THE FITTINGS OF THE SANCTUARY
3006-5698-0031 IT SHOULD BE AT LEAST SCRUPULOUSLY SCREENED AND MASKED UNDER AN OSTENSIBLE AUSTERITY IN THE MOST REPUTABLE LATTER DAY HOUSES OF WORSHIP WHERE NO EXPENSE IS SPARED THE PRINCIPLE OF AUSTERITY IS CARRIED TO THE LENGTH OF MAKING THE FITTINGS OF THE PLACE A MEANS OF MORTIFYING THE FLESH
3006-5698-0032 ESPECIALLY IN APPEARANCE THERE ARE FEW PERSONS OF DELICATE TASTES IN THE MATTER OF DEVOUT CONSUMPTION TO WHOM THIS AUSTERELY WASTEFUL DISCOMFORT DOES NOT APPEAL AS INTRINSICALLY RIGHT AND GOOD
3006-5698-0033 BACKED BY THE PRINCIPLE THAT VICARIOUS CONSUMPTION SHOULD CONSPICUOUSLY NOT CONDUCE TO THE COMFORT OF THE VICARIOUS CONSUMER
3006-5698-0034 THE SANCTUARY AND ITS FITTINGS HAVE SOMETHING OF THIS AUSTERITY IN ALL THE CULTS IN WHICH THE SAINT OR DIVINITY TO WHOM THE SANCTUARY PERTAINS IS NOT CONCEIVED TO BE PRESENT AND MAKE PERSONAL USE OF THE PROPERTY FOR THE GRATIFICATION OF LUXURIOUS TASTES IMPUTED TO HIM
3006-5698-0035 THE CHARACTER OF THE SACRED PARAPHERNALIA IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT IN THIS RESPECT IN THOSE CULTS WHERE THE HABITS OF LIFE IMPUTED TO THE DIVINITY MORE NEARLY APPROACH THOSE OF AN EARTHLY PATRIARCHAL POTENTATE WHERE HE IS CONCEIVED TO MAKE USE OF THESE CONSUMABLE GOODS IN PERSON
3006-5698-0036 IN THE LATTER CASE THE SANCTUARY AND ITS FITTINGS TAKE ON MORE OF THE FASHION GIVEN TO GOODS DESTINED FOR THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF A TEMPORAL MASTER OR OWNER ON THE OTHER HAND WHERE THE SACRED APPARATUS IS SIMPLY EMPLOYED IN THE DIVINITY'S SERVICE
3006-5698-0037 THAT IS TO SAY WHERE IT IS CONSUMED VICARIOUSLY ON HIS ACCOUNT BY HIS SERVANTS THERE THE SACRED PROPERTIES TAKE THE CHARACTER SUITED TO GOODS THAT ARE DESTINED FOR VICARIOUS CONSUMPTION ONLY
3006-5698-0038 IN THE LATTER CASE THE SANCTUARY AND THE SACRED APPARATUS ARE SO CONTRIVED AS NOT TO ENHANCE THE COMFORT OR FULLNESS OF LIFE OF THE VICARIOUS CONSUMER OR AT ANY RATE NOT TO CONVEY THE IMPRESSION THAT THE END OF THEIR CONSUMPTION IS THE CONSUMER'S COMFORT
3006-5698-0039 FOR THE END OF VICARIOUS CONSUMPTION IS TO ENHANCE NOT THE FULLNESS OF LIFE OF THE CONSUMER BUT THE PECUNIARY REPUTE OF THE MASTER FOR WHOSE BEHOOF THE CONSUMPTION TAKES PLACE THEREFORE PRIESTLY VESTMENTS ARE NOTORIOUSLY EXPENSIVE ORNATE
3006-5698-0040 AND INCONVENIENT AND IN THE CULTS WHERE THE PRIESTLY SERVITOR OF THE DIVINITY IS NOT CONCEIVED TO SERVE HIM IN THE CAPACITY OF CONSORT THEY ARE OF AN AUSTERE COMFORTLESS FASHION AND SUCH IT IS FELT THAT THEY SHOULD BE
3006-5698-0041 IT IS NOT ONLY IN ESTABLISHING A DEVOUT STANDARD OF DECENT EXPENSIVENESS THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF WASTE INVADES THE DOMAIN OF THE CANONS OF RITUAL SERVICEABILITY IT TOUCHES THE WAYS AS WELL AS THE MEANS AND DRAWS ON VICARIOUS LEISURE AS WELL AS ON VICARIOUS CONSUMPTION
3006-5698-0042 PRIESTLY DEMEANOR AT ITS BEST IS ALOOF LEISURELY PERFUNCTORY AND UNCONTAMINATED WITH SUGGESTIONS OF SENSUOUS PLEASURE THIS HOLDS TRUE IN DIFFERENT DEGREES OF COURSE FOR THE DIFFERENT CULTS AND DENOMINATIONS
3006-5698-0043 TENDENCY TO REDUCE ITSELF TO A REHEARSAL OF FORMULAS THIS DEVELOPMENT OF FORMULA IS MOST NOTICEABLE IN THE MATURER CULTS WHICH HAVE AT THE SAME TIME A MORE AUSTERE ORNATE AND SEVERE PRIESTLY LIFE AND GARB
3006-5698-0044 BUT IT IS PERCEPTIBLE ALSO IN THE FORMS AND METHODS OF WORSHIP OF THE NEWER AND FRESHER SECTS WHOSE TASTES IN RESPECT OF PRIESTS VESTMENTS AND SANCTUARIES ARE LESS EXACTING THE REHEARSAL OF THE SERVICE
3006-5698-0045 THE TERM SERVICE CARRIES A SUGGESTION SIGNIFICANT FOR THE POINT IN QUESTION GROWS MORE PERFUNCTORY AS THE CULT GAINS IN AGE AND CONSISTENCY AND THIS PERFUNCTORINESS OF THE REHEARSAL IS VERY PLEASING TO THE CORRECT DEVOUT TASTE AND WITH A GOOD REASON
3006-5698-0046 FOR THE FACT OF ITS BEING PERFUNCTORY GOES TO SAY POINTEDLY THAT THE MASTER FOR WHOM IT IS PERFORMED IS EXALTED ABOVE THE VULGAR NEED OF ACTUALLY PROFICUOUS SERVICE ON THE PART OF HIS SERVANTS THEY ARE UNPROFITABLE SERVANTS
3006-5698-0047 AND THERE IS AN HONORIFIC IMPLICATION FOR THEIR MASTER IN THEIR REMAINING UNPROFITABLE IT IS NEEDLESS TO POINT OUT THE CLOSE ANALOGY AT THIS POINT BETWEEN THE PRIESTLY OFFICE AND THE OFFICE OF THE FOOTMAN
3006-5698-0048 IT IS PLEASING TO OUR SENSE OF WHAT IS FITTING IN THESE MATTERS IN EITHER CASE TO RECOGNIZE IN THE OBVIOUS PERFUNCTORINESS OF THE SERVICE THAT IT IS A PRO FORMA EXECUTION ONLY
3006-5698-0049 THERE SHOULD BE NO SHOW OF AGILITY OR OF DEXTEROUS MANIPULATION IN THE EXECUTION OF THE PRIESTLY OFFICE SUCH AS MIGHT SUGGEST A CAPACITY FOR TURNING OFF THE WORK
3006-5698-0050 TASTES PROPENSITIES AND HABITS OF LIFE IMPUTED TO THE DIVINITY BY WORSHIPPERS WHO LIVE UNDER THE TRADITION OF THESE PECUNIARY CANONS OF REPUTABILITY THROUGH ITS PERVADING MEN'S HABITS OF THOUGHT
3006-5698-0051 IT IS OF COURSE IN THE MORE NAIVE CULTS THAT THIS SUFFUSION OF PECUNIARY BEAUTY IS MOST PATENT BUT IT IS VISIBLE THROUGHOUT ALL PEOPLES AT WHATEVER STAGE OF CULTURE OR DEGREE OF ENLIGHTENMENT
3006-5698-0052 ARE FAIN TO EKE OUT A SENSIBLY SCANT DEGREE OF AUTHENTIC FORMATION REGARDING THE PERSONALITY AND HABITUAL SURROUNDINGS OF THEIR DIVINITIES IN SO CALLING IN THE AID OF FANCY TO ENRICH AND FILL IN THEIR PICTURE OF THE DIVINITY'S PRESENCE AND MANNER OF LIFE THEY HABITUALLY IMPUTE TO HIM
3006-5698-0053 SUCH TRAITS AS GO TO MAKE UP THEIR IDEAL OF A WORTHY MAN AND IN SEEKING COMMUNION WITH THE DIVINITY THE WAYS AND MEANS OF APPROACH ARE ASSIMILATED AS NEARLY AS MAY BE TO THE DIVINE IDEAL THAT IS IN MEN'S MINDS AT THE TIME
3006-5698-0054 IT IS FELT THAT THE DIVINE PRESENCE IS ENTERED WITH THE BEST GRACE AND WITH THE BEST EFFECT ACCORDING TO CERTAIN ACCEPTED METHODS AND WITH THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH IN POPULAR APPREHENSION ARE PECULIARLY CONSONANT WITH THE DIVINE NATURE
3006-5698-0055 THIS POPULARLY ACCEPTED IDEAL OF THE BEARING AND PARAPHERNALIA ADEQUATE TO SUCH OCCASIONS OF COMMUNION IS OF COURSE TO A GOOD EXTENT SHAPED BY THE POPULAR APPREHENSION OF WHAT IS INTRINSICALLY WORTHY AND BEAUTIFUL IN HUMAN CARRIAGE AND SURROUNDINGS ON ALL OCCASIONS OF DIGNIFIED INTERCOURSE
3006-5698-0056 OF A PECUNIARY STANDARD OF REPUTABILITY BACK DIRECTLY AND BALDLY TO THE UNDERLYING NORM OF PECUNIARY EMULATION
3006-5698-0057 AS WELL AS OUR NOTIONS OF WHAT ARE THE FIT AND ADEQUATE MANNER AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF DIVINE COMMUNION IT IS FELT THAT THE DIVINITY MUST BE OF A PECULIARLY SERENE AND LEISURELY HABIT OF LIFE AND WHENEVER HIS LOCAL HABITATION IS PICTURED IN POETIC IMAGERY
3006-5698-0058 FOR EDIFICATION OR IN APPEAL TO THE DEVOUT FANCY THE DEVOUT WORD PAINTER AS A MATTER OF COURSE BRINGS OUT BEFORE HIS AUDITORS IMAGINATION A THRONE WITH A PROFUSION OF THE INSIGNIA OF OPULENCE AND POWER AND SURROUNDED BY A GREAT NUMBER OF SERVITORS
3006-5698-0059 IN THE COMMON RUN OF SUCH PRESENTATIONS OF THE CELESTIAL ABODES THE OFFICE OF THIS CORPS OF SERVANTS IS A VICARIOUS LEISURE THEIR TIME AND EFFORTS BEING IN GREAT MEASURE TAKEN UP WITH AN INDUSTRIALLY UNPRODUCTIVE
3006-5698-0060 REHEARSAL OF THE MERITORIOUS CHARACTERISTICS AND EXPLOITS OF THE DIVINITY WHILE THE BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENTATION IS FILLED WITH THE SHIMMER OF THE PRECIOUS METALS AND OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE VARIETIES OF PRECIOUS STONES
3006-5698-0061 IT IS ONLY IN THE CRASSER EXPRESSIONS OF DEVOUT FANCY THAT THIS INTRUSION OF PECUNIARY CANONS INTO THE DEVOUT IDEALS REACHES SUCH AN EXTREME AN EXTREME CASE OCCURS IN THE DEVOUT IMAGERY OF THE NEGRO POPULATION OF THE SOUTH
