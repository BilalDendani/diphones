3618-178097-0000 AS WE SHOULD EXPECT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF INSTANCES OF WARNING APPARITIONS IN ANTIQUITY AND IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE MAJORITY OF THESE ARE GIGANTIC WOMEN ENDOWED WITH A GIFT OF PROPHECY
3618-178097-0001 WHO WAS ON THE STAFF OF THE GOVERNOR OF AFRICA WAS WALKING ONE DAY IN A COLONNADE AFTER SUNSET WHEN A GIGANTIC WOMAN APPEARED BEFORE HIM SHE ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WAS AFRICA AND WAS ABLE TO PREDICT THE FUTURE AND TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD GO TO ROME
3618-178097-0002 HOLD OFFICE THERE RETURN TO THE PROVINCE WITH THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY AND THERE DIE HER PROPHECY WAS FULFILLED TO THE LETTER
3618-178097-0003 THE SAME FIGURE IS REPORTED TO HAVE MET HIM SO AGAIN AT THE TIME OF THE CONSPIRACY OF CALLIPPUS DION WAS MEDITATING ONE EVENING BEFORE THE PORCH OF HIS HOUSE WHEN HE TURNED ROUND AND SAW A GIGANTIC FEMALE FIGURE IN THE FORM OF A FURY
3618-178097-0004 INSATIATE DRUSUS WHITHER WILT THOU GO THOU ART NOT FATED TO SEE ALL THINGS DEPART HENCE FOR THE END OF THY LIFE AND OF THY DEEDS IS AT HAND DRUSUS WAS MUCH TROUBLED BY THIS WARNING AND
3618-178097-0005 INSTANTLY OBEYED THE WORDS OF THE APPARITION BUT HE DIED BEFORE REACHING THE RHINE WE MEET WITH THE SAME PHENOMENON AGAIN IN DIO CASSIUS AMONG THE PRODIGIES PRECEDING THE DEATH OF MACRINUS WHEN
3618-178097-0006 A DREADFUL GIGANTIC WOMAN SEEN OF SEVERAL DECLARED THAT ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED WAS AS NOTHING COMPARED WITH WHAT THEY WERE SOON TO ENDURE A PROPHECY WHICH WAS AMPLY FULFILLED BY THE REIGN OF HELIOGABALUS
3618-178097-0007 BUT THE MOST GIGANTIC OF ALL THESE GIGANTIC WOMEN WAS AS WE SHOULD ONLY EXPECT FROM HIS MARVELLOUS POWER OF SEEING GHOSTS
3618-178097-0008 THOUGH AT FIRST HE FOUND THEM RATHER UPSETTING BUT HE HAD BEEN GIVEN A RING AND A CHARM BY AN ARAB WHICH ENABLED HIM TO DEAL WITH ANYTHING SUPERNATURAL THAT CAME IN HIS WAY THE RING WAS MADE FROM THE IRON OF A CROSS ON WHICH A CRIMINAL HAD BEEN EXECUTED
3618-178097-0009 WITH WHICH A MAN HAS BEEN HUNG POSSESSES IN THE EYES OF A GAMBLER TO DAY ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE HAD LEFT HIS MEN AT WORK IN THE VINEYARD AND WAS RESTING QUIETLY AT MIDDAY WHEN HIS DOG BEGAN TO BARK
3618-178097-0010 AT FIRST HE THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY A FAVOURITE BOY OF HIS INDULGING IN A LITTLE HUNTING WITH SOME FRIENDS BUT ON LOOKING UP HE SAW IN FRONT OF HIM A WOMAN AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED FEET HIGH WITH A SWORD THIRTY FEET LONG
3618-178097-0011 HER LOWER EXTREMITIES WERE LIKE THOSE OF A DRAGON AND SNAKES WERE COILING ROUND HER NECK AND SHOULDERS
3618-178097-0012 WHEN A VAST CHASM OPENED IN THE EARTH INTO WHICH SHE DISAPPEARED THIS SEEMS RATHER TO HAVE ASTONISHED EUCRATES BUT HE PLUCKED UP COURAGE CAUGHT HOLD OF A TREE THAT STOOD NEAR THE EDGE AND LOOKED OVER
3618-178097-0013 INCLUDING THE MEAD OF ASPHODEL WHERE THE SHADES OF THE BLESSED WERE RECLINING AT EASE WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS ARRANGED ACCORDING TO CLANS AND TRIBES AMONG THESE HE RECOGNIZED HIS OWN FATHER DRESSED IN THE CLOTHES IN WHICH HE WAS BURIED
3618-178097-0014 AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN COMFORTING TO THE SON TO HAVE SUCH GOOD EVIDENCE THAT HIS PARENT WAS SAFELY INSTALLED IN THE ELYSIAN FIELDS IN A FEW MOMENTS THE CHASM CLOSED
3618-178097-0015 NEARLY THE WHOLE OF ANTIOCH BY A PHANTOM WHICH APPEARED TO HIM SUDDENLY AND WARNED HIM TO LEAVE HIS HOUSE BY THE WINDOW
3618-178097-0016 WHO WAS WARNED BY A SPECTRE THAT HIS HOUSE WAS GOING TO FALL AND THUS ENABLED TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE IN TIME I WILL INCLUDE HERE A COUPLE OF STORIES WHICH IF THEY CANNOT EXACTLY BE CLASSED AS STORIES OF WARNING APPARITIONS ARE INTERESTING IN THEMSELVES
3618-178097-0017 AND MAY AT LEAST BE CONSIDERED AS GHOST STORIES
3618-178097-0018 IMAGINED THAT HE SAW SOMEONE CUTTING HIS HAIR DURING THE NIGHT WHEN HE AWOKE
3618-178097-0019 FOR HIS HAIR LAY ALL ROUND HIM SOON AFTERWARDS THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN HIS BROTHER WHO SLEPT WITH HIM SAW NOTHING BUT MARCUS DECLARED THAT TWO PEOPLE CAME IN BY THE WINDOWS DRESSED IN WHITE AND AFTER CUTTING HIS HAIR DISAPPEARED
3618-178097-0020 NOTHING ASTONISHING HAPPENED ADDS PLINY EXCEPT THAT I WAS NOT PROSECUTED AS I UNDOUBTEDLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAD DOMITIAN LIVED FOR THIS HAPPENED DURING HIS PRINCIPATE PERHAPS THE CUTTING OF MY SLAVE'S HAIR WAS A SIGN OF MY APPROACHING DOOM
3618-178097-0021 FOR ACCUSED PEOPLE CUT THEIR HAIR AS A SIGN OF MOURNING ONE MAY BE ALLOWED TO WONDER WHETHER AFTER ALL A FONDNESS FOR PRACTICAL JOKING IS NOT EVEN OLDER THAN THE AGE OF THE YOUNGER PLINY
3618-178097-0022 THIS STORY LIKE NEARLY EVERY OTHER THAT WE HAVE COME ACROSS HAS A PARALLEL IN THE PHILOPSEUDUS INDEED LUCIAN SEEMS TO HAVE COVERED ALMOST THE WHOLE FIELD OF THE MARVELLOUS AS UNDERSTOOD AT THAT TIME IN HIS DETERMINATION TO TURN IT INTO RIDICULE IN THAT AMUSING DIALOGUE
3618-178097-0023 IN THIS CASE WE ARE TOLD OF A LITTLE STATUE OF A ESCULAPIUS WHICH STOOD IN THE HOUSE OF THE NARRATOR OF THE STORY AND AT THE FEET OF WHICH A NUMBER OF PENCE HAD BEEN PLACED AS OFFERINGS WHILE OTHER COINS SOME OF THEM SILVER WERE FASTENED TO THE THIGHS WITH WAX
3618-178097-0024 THERE WERE ALSO SILVER PLATES WHICH HAD BEEN VOWED OR OFFERED BY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN CURED OF FEVER BY THE GOD THE OFFERINGS AND TABLETS ARE JUST SUCH AS MIGHT BE FOUND IN A CATHOLIC CHURCH IN THE SOUTH OF EUROPE TO DAY BUT THE COINS IN OUR MORE PRACTICAL MODERN WORLD
3618-178097-0025 WOULD HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THE COFFERS OF THE CHURCH ONE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE ULTIMATE DESTINATION OF THESE PARTICULAR COINS WHETHER THEY WERE TO BE SENT AS CONTRIBUTIONS TO ONE OF THE TEMPLES OF A ESCULAPIUS WHICH WERE THE CENTRE OF THE MEDICAL WORLD AT THIS PERIOD
3618-178097-0026 AND HAD ELABORATE HOSPITALS ATTACHED TO THEM ABOUT WHICH WE LEARN SO MUCH FROM ARISTIDES IN THIS CASE THEY WERE MERELY A SOURCE OF TEMPTATION TO AN UNFORTUNATE LIBYAN GROOM WHO STOLE THEM ONE NIGHT INTENDING TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE
3618-178097-0027 BUT HE HAD NOT STUDIED THE HABITS OF THE STATUE WHICH WE ARE TOLD HABITUALLY GOT DOWN FROM ITS PEDESTAL EVERY NIGHT AND IN THIS CASE SUCH WAS THE POWER OF THE GOD THAT HE KEPT THE MAN WANDERING ABOUT ALL NIGHT UNABLE TO LEAVE THE COURT
3618-178097-0028 THE GOD HOWEVER CONSIDERED THAT HE HAD BEEN LET OFF MUCH TOO EASILY AND HE WAS MYSTERIOUSLY FLOGGED EVERY NIGHT AS THE WEALS UPON HIM SHOWED TILL HE ULTIMATELY DIED OF THE PUNISHMENT
3618-178097-0029 HE WAS STILL APPARENTLY IN THE FULL VIGOUR OF HIS POWERS WHEN HE HAD A VISION OF NINE MAIDENS
3618-178097-0030 AND BIDDING HIM FAREWELL WHEN HE AWOKE
3618-178097-0031 WITH WHICH HE WAS THEN BUSY AFTER COMPLETING IT TO HIS SATISFACTION
3618-178097-0032 HIS SLAVE CAME IN AND THINKING HE WAS ASLEEP WENT TO WAKE HIM WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE WAS DEAD A ELIAN CHALLENGES THE UNBELIEVING EPICUREANS TO DENY THAT THE NINE MAIDENS WERE THE NINE MUSES
3618-178097-0033 MANY STORIES NATURALLY GATHER ROUND THE GREAT STRUGGLE FOR THE FINAL MASTERY OF THE ROMAN WORLD WHICH ENDED IN THE OVERTHROW OF THE REPUBLIC SHAKESPEARE HAS MADE US FAMILIAR WITH THE FATE OF THE POET CINNA
3618-178097-0034 WHO WAS ACTUALLY MISTAKEN FOR ONE OF THE CONSPIRATORS AGAINST CAESAR AND MURDERED BY THE CROWD HE DREAMT ON THE NIGHT BEFORE HE MET HIS DEATH THAT CAESAR INVITED HIM TO SUPPER AND WHEN HE REFUSED THE INVITATION TOOK HIM BY THE HAND
3618-178097-0035 AND FORCED HIM DOWN INTO A DEEP DARK ABYSS WHICH HE ENTERED WITH THE UTMOST HORROR BUT THERE IS A STORY CONNECTED WITH THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON BY CAESAR
3618-178097-0036 FRAUGHT WITH SUCH MOMENTOUS CONSEQUENCES SHOULD HAVE A SUPERNATURAL SETTING OF SOME KIND AND SUETONIUS RELATES THAT WHILE CAESAR WAS STILL HESITATING WHETHER HE SHOULD DECLARE HIMSELF AN ENEMY OF HIS COUNTRY BY
3618-178097-0037 CROSSING THE LITTLE RIVER THAT BOUNDED HIS PROVINCE AT THE HEAD OF AN ARMY A MAN OF HEROIC SIZE AND BEAUTY SUDDENLY APPEARED PLAYING UPON A REED PIPE SOME OF THE TROOPS SEVERAL TRUMPETERS AMONG THEM RAN UP TO LISTEN
3618-178097-0038 WHEN THE MAN SEIZED A TRUMPET BLEW A LOUD BLAST UPON IT AND BEGAN TO CROSS THE RUBICON
3618-178097-0039 AND THE MEN FOLLOWED HIM WITH REDOUBLED ENTHUSIASM AFTER WHAT THEY HAD JUST SEEN IT IS TO PLUTARCH THAT WE OWE THE FAMOUS STORY OF THE APPARITION THAT VISITED BRUTUS IN HIS TENT
3618-178097-0040 AND AGAIN DURING THE BATTLE SHAKESPEARE REPRESENTS IT TO BE CAESAR'S GHOST BUT HAS OTHERWISE STRICTLY FOLLOWED PLUTARCH
3618-178097-0041 HOW ILL THIS TAPER BURNS HA WHO COMES HERE
3618-178097-0042 BRUTUS WELL THEN I SHALL SEE THEE AGAIN GHOST AY
3618-178097-0043 BRUTUS WHY
3618-178097-0044 NOW I HAVE TAKEN HEART THOU VANISHEST ILL SPIRIT
