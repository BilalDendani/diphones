927-132462-0000 ON AN EXCEPTIONALLY HOT EVENING EARLY IN JULY A YOUNG MAN CAME OUT OF THE GARRET IN WHICH HE LODGED IN S PLACE AND WALKED SLOWLY AS THOUGH IN HESITATION TOWARDS K BRIDGE
927-132462-0001 HE HAD SUCCESSFULLY AVOIDED MEETING HIS LANDLADY ON THE STAIRCASE HIS GARRET WAS UNDER THE ROOF OF A HIGH FIVE STORIED HOUSE AND WAS MORE
927-132462-0002 ROOM THE LANDLADY WHO PROVIDED HIM WITH GARRET DINNERS AND ATTENDANCE LIVED ON THE FLOOR BELOW AND EVERY TIME HE WENT OUT
927-132462-0003 INVARIABLY STOOD OPEN AND EACH TIME HE PASSED THE YOUNG MAN HAD A SICK FRIGHTENED FEELING WHICH MADE HIM SCOWL AND FEEL ASHAMED
927-132462-0004 HE WAS HOPELESSLY IN DEBT TO HIS LANDLADY AND WAS AFRAID OF MEETING HER THIS WAS NOT BECAUSE HE WAS COWARDLY AND ABJECT
927-132462-0005 QUITE THE CONTRARY BUT FOR SOME TIME PAST HE HAD BEEN IN AN OVERSTRAINED IRRITABLE CONDITION
927-132462-0006 HE HAD BECOME SO COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN HIMSELF AND ISOLATED FROM HIS FELLOWS
927-132462-0007 BUT ANYONE AT ALL HE WAS CRUSHED BY POVERTY
927-132462-0008 HE HAD GIVEN UP ATTENDING TO MATTERS OF PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE HE HAD LOST ALL DESIRE TO DO SO
927-132462-0009 THAT ANY LANDLADY COULD DO
927-132462-0010 BUT TO BE STOPPED ON THE STAIRS TO BE FORCED TO LISTEN TO HER TRIVIAL IRRELEVANT GOSSIP TO PESTERING DEMANDS FOR PAYMENT THREATS AND COMPLAINTS
927-132462-0011 AND TO RACK HIS BRAINS FOR EXCUSES TO PREVARICATE
927-132462-0012 HE WOULD CREEP DOWN THE STAIRS LIKE A CAT AND SLIP OUT UNSEEN THIS EVENING
927-132462-0013 ON COMING OUT INTO THE STREET HE BECAME
927-132462-0014 ALL IS IN A MAN'S HANDS AND HE LETS IT ALL SLIP FROM COWARDICE THAT'S AN AXIOM IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW WHAT IT IS MEN ARE MOST AFRAID OF
927-132462-0015 UTTERING A NEW WORD IS WHAT THEY FEAR MOST BUT I AM TALKING TOO MUCH
927-132462-0016 I CHATTER BECAUSE I DO NOTHING
927-132462-0017 AM I CAPABLE OF THAT IS THAT SERIOUS IT IS NOT SERIOUS AT ALL IT'S SIMPLY A FANTASY TO AMUSE MYSELF A PLAYTHING YES
927-132462-0018 MAYBE IT IS A PLAYTHING THE HEAT IN THE STREET WAS TERRIBLE
927-132462-0019 AIRLESSNESS THE BUSTLE AND THE PLASTER SCAFFOLDING BRICKS AND DUST ALL ABOUT HIM AND THAT SPECIAL PETERSBURG STENCH
927-132462-0020 SO FAMILIAR TO ALL WHO ARE UNABLE TO GET OUT OF TOWN IN SUMMER
927-132462-0021 AND THE DRUNKEN MEN WHOM HE MET CONTINUALLY
927-132462-0022 AN EXPRESSION OF THE PROFOUNDEST DISGUST GLEAMED FOR A MOMENT IN THE YOUNG MAN'S REFINED FACE HE WAS
927-132462-0023 EXCEPTIONALLY HANDSOME ABOVE THE AVERAGE IN HEIGHT SLIM WELL BUILT WITH BEAUTIFUL DARK EYES AND DARK BROWN HAIR
927-132462-0024 SOON HE SANK INTO DEEP THOUGHT OR MORE ACCURATELY SPEAKING INTO A COMPLETE BLANKNESS OF MIND
927-132462-0025 FROM TIME TO TIME HE WOULD MUTTER SOMETHING FROM THE HABIT OF TALKING TO HIMSELF TO WHICH HE HAD JUST CONFESSED AT THESE MOMENTS HE WOULD BECOME CONSCIOUS
927-132462-0026 THAT HIS IDEAS WERE SOMETIMES IN A TANGLE AND THAT HE WAS VERY WEAK FOR TWO DAYS HE HAD SCARCELY TASTED FOOD
927-132462-0027 WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO BE SEEN IN THE STREET IN SUCH RAGS IN THAT QUARTER OF THE TOWN HOWEVER
927-132462-0028 WOULD HAVE CREATED SURPRISE OWING TO THE PROXIMITY OF THE HAY MARKET THE NUMBER OF ESTABLISHMENTS OF BAD CHARACTER THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE TRADING
927-132462-0029 AND WORKING CLASS POPULATION CROWDED IN THESE STREETS AND ALLEYS IN THE HEART OF PETERSBURG
927-132462-0030 IN THE STREETS THAT NO FIGURE HOWEVER QUEER WOULD HAVE CAUSED SURPRISE BUT THERE WAS SUCH ACCUMULATED BITTERNESS AND CONTEMPT IN THE YOUNG MAN'S HEART
927-132462-0031 WHOM INDEED HE DISLIKED MEETING AT ANY TIME AND YET
927-132462-0032 WAS BEING TAKEN SOMEWHERE IN A HUGE WAGGON DRAGGED BY A HEAVY DRAY HORSE SUDDENLY SHOUTED AT HIM AS HE DROVE PAST
927-132462-0033 BAWLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE AND POINTING AT HIM THE YOUNG MAN STOPPED SUDDENLY AND CLUTCHED TREMULOUSLY AT HIS HAT
927-132462-0034 BUT COMPLETELY WORN OUT
927-132462-0035 ALL TORN AND BESPATTERED BRIMLESS AND BENT ON ONE SIDE IN A MOST UNSEEMLY FASHION
927-132462-0036 HAD OVERTAKEN HIM I KNEW IT HE MUTTERED IN CONFUSION I THOUGHT SO
927-132462-0037 THE MOST TRIVIAL DETAIL
927-132462-0038 YES MY HAT IS TOO NOTICEABLE
927-132462-0039 THAT MAKES IT NOTICEABLE WITH MY RAGS I OUGHT TO WEAR A CAP ANY SORT OF OLD PANCAKE BUT NOT THIS GROTESQUE THING
927-132462-0040 IT WOULD BE NOTICED A MILE OFF IT WOULD BE REMEMBERED WHAT MATTERS IS THAT PEOPLE WOULD REMEMBER IT
927-132462-0041 FOR THIS BUSINESS ONE SHOULD BE AS LITTLE CONSPICUOUS AS POSSIBLE TRIFLES TRIFLES ARE WHAT MATTER WHY IT'S JUST SUCH TRIFLES
927-132462-0042 HE HAD NOT FAR TO GO HE KNEW INDEED HOW MANY STEPS IT WAS FROM THE GATE OF HIS LODGING HOUSE EXACTLY SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY HE HAD COUNTED THEM ONCE
927-132462-0043 WHEN HE HAD BEEN LOST IN DREAMS AT THE TIME HE HAD PUT NO FAITH
927-132462-0044 NOW A MONTH LATER HE HAD BEGUN TO LOOK UPON THEM DIFFERENTLY AND IN SPITE OF THE MONOLOGUES IN WHICH HE JEERED AT HIS OWN IMPOTENCE AND INDECISION
927-132462-0045 AS AN EXPLOIT TO BE ATTEMPTED ALTHOUGH HE STILL DID NOT REALISE THIS HIMSELF
927-132462-0046 AND AT EVERY STEP HIS EXCITEMENT GREW MORE AND MORE VIOLENT
927-132462-0047 ON THE RIGHT AND UP THE STAIRCASE IT WAS A BACK STAIRCASE DARK
927-132462-0048 OF THE OLD WOMAN'S FLAT THE BELL GAVE A FAINT TINKLE AS THOUGH IT WERE MADE OF TIN AND NOT OF COPPER THE LITTLE FLATS IN SUCH HOUSES ALWAYS HAVE BELLS
927-132462-0049 HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE NOTE OF THAT BELL AND NOW ITS PECULIAR TINKLE SEEMED TO REMIND HIM OF SOMETHING
927-132462-0050 HE STARTED HIS NERVES WERE TERRIBLY OVERSTRAINED BY NOW IN A LITTLE WHILE THE DOOR WAS OPENED A TINY CRACK THE OLD WOMAN EYED HER VISITOR
927-132462-0051 WITH EVIDENT DISTRUST THROUGH THE CRACK AND NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT HER LITTLE EYES
927-132462-0052 BUT SEEING A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE LANDING SHE GREW BOLDER AND OPENED THE DOOR WIDE THE YOUNG MAN STEPPED INTO THE DARK ENTRY WHICH WAS
927-132462-0053 PARTITIONED OFF FROM THE TINY KITCHEN THE OLD WOMAN STOOD FACING HIM IN SILENCE
927-132462-0054 AND IN SPITE OF THE HEAT
927-132462-0055 THE OLD WOMAN COUGHED AND GROANED AT EVERY INSTANT THE YOUNG MAN MUST HAVE LOOKED AT HER WITH A RATHER PECULIAR EXPRESSION FOR A GLEAM OF MISTRUST CAME INTO HER EYES AGAIN
927-132462-0056 REMEMBERING THAT HE OUGHT TO BE MORE POLITE
927-132462-0057 THE OLD WOMAN SAID DISTINCTLY STILL KEEPING HER INQUIRING EYES ON HIS FACE AND HERE
927-132462-0058 I AM AGAIN ON THE SAME ERRAND RASKOLNIKOV CONTINUED A LITTLE DISCONCERTED AND SURPRISED AT THE OLD WOMAN'S MISTRUST PERHAPS SHE IS ALWAYS LIKE THAT THOUGH
927-132462-0059 AS THOUGH HESITATING THEN STEPPED ON ONE SIDE AND POINTING TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM SHE SAID LETTING HER VISITOR PASS IN FRONT OF HER STEP IN MY GOOD SIR
927-132462-0060 THE LITTLE ROOM INTO WHICH THE YOUNG MAN WALKED WITH YELLOW PAPER ON THE WALLS GERANIUMS AND MUSLIN CURTAINS IN THE WINDOWS WAS BRIGHTLY LIGHTED UP AT THAT MOMENT BY THE SETTING SUN
927-132462-0061 FLASHED AS IT WERE BY CHANCE
927-132462-0062 TRYING AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO NOTICE AND REMEMBER ITS ARRANGEMENT BUT THERE WAS NOTHING SPECIAL IN THE ROOM
927-132462-0063 AN OVAL TABLE IN FRONT OF THE SOFA A DRESSING TABLE WITH A LOOKING GLASS FIXED ON IT BETWEEN THE WINDOWS CHAIRS ALONG THE WALLS
927-132462-0064 REPRESENTING GERMAN DAMSELS WITH BIRDS IN THEIR HANDS THAT WAS ALL IN THE CORNER A LIGHT WAS BURNING BEFORE A SMALL IKON
927-132462-0065 THE FLOOR AND THE FURNITURE WERE BRIGHTLY POLISHED
927-132462-0066 THERE WAS NOT A SPECK OF DUST TO BE SEEN IN THE WHOLE FLAT
927-132462-0067 THAT ONE FINDS SUCH CLEANLINESS RASKOLNIKOV THOUGHT AGAIN AND HE STOLE A CURIOUS GLANCE AT THE COTTON CURTAIN
927-132462-0068 IN WHICH STOOD THE OLD WOMAN'S BED AND CHEST OF DRAWERS
927-132462-0069 THESE TWO ROOMS MADE UP THE WHOLE FLAT
927-132462-0070 AND HE DREW OUT OF HIS POCKET AN OLD FASHIONED FLAT SILVER WATCH ON THE BACK OF WHICH WAS ENGRAVED A GLOBE THE CHAIN WAS OF STEEL BUT THE TIME IS UP FOR YOUR LAST PLEDGE
927-132462-0071 THE MONTH WAS UP THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY
927-132462-0072 TO WAIT OR TO SELL YOUR PLEDGE AT ONCE HOW MUCH WILL YOU GIVE ME FOR THE WATCH
927-132462-0073 YOU COME WITH SUCH TRIFLES MY GOOD SIR IT'S SCARCELY WORTH ANYTHING I GAVE YOU TWO ROUBLES LAST TIME
927-132462-0074 GIVE ME FOUR ROUBLES FOR IT I SHALL REDEEM IT IT WAS MY FATHER'S I SHALL BE GETTING SOME MONEY SOON
927-132462-0075 IF YOU LIKE A ROUBLE AND A HALF CRIED THE YOUNG MAN PLEASE YOURSELF AND THE OLD WOMAN HANDED HIM BACK THE WATCH THE YOUNG MAN TOOK IT
927-132462-0076 BUT CHECKED HIMSELF AT ONCE REMEMBERING THAT THERE WAS NOWHERE ELSE HE COULD GO
927-132462-0077 HAND IT OVER HE SAID ROUGHLY THE OLD WOMAN FUMBLED IN HER POCKET FOR HER KEYS AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE CURTAIN INTO THE OTHER ROOM
927-132462-0078 THE YOUNG MAN LEFT STANDING ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM LISTENED INQUISITIVELY THINKING HE COULD HEAR HER UNLOCKING THE CHEST OF DRAWERS
927-132462-0079 IT MUST BE THE TOP DRAWER HE REFLECTED SO SHE CARRIES THE KEYS IN A POCKET ON THE RIGHT
927-132462-0080 THREE TIMES AS BIG AS ALL THE OTHERS
927-132462-0081 THAT'S WORTH KNOWING STRONG BOXES ALWAYS HAVE KEYS LIKE THAT
927-132462-0082 DEGRADING IT ALL IS THE OLD WOMAN CAME BACK HERE SIR AS WE SAY TEN COPECKS THE ROUBLE A MONTH
927-132462-0083 AND A HALF FOR THE MONTH IN ADVANCE BUT FOR THE TWO ROUBLES I LENT YOU BEFORE YOU OWE ME NOW TWENTY COPECKS ON THE SAME RECKONING IN ADVANCE
927-132462-0084 THAT MAKES THIRTY FIVE COPECKS ALTOGETHER SO I MUST GIVE YOU A ROUBLE AND FIFTEEN COPECKS
927-132462-0085 ONLY A ROUBLE AND FIFTEEN COPECKS NOW JUST SO THE YOUNG MAN DID NOT DISPUTE IT AND TOOK THE MONEY
927-132462-0086 AND WAS IN NO HURRY TO GET AWAY AS THOUGH THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING HE WANTED TO SAY OR TO DO
927-132462-0087 HE BROKE OFF IN CONFUSION WELL WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT THEN SIR GOOD BYE ARE YOU ALWAYS AT HOME ALONE YOUR SISTER IS NOT HERE WITH YOU
927-132462-0088 HE ASKED HER AS CASUALLY AS POSSIBLE
927-132462-0089 YOU ARE TOO QUICK GOOD DAY ALYONA IVANOVNA
927-132462-0090 THIS CONFUSION BECAME MORE AND MORE INTENSE AS HE WENT DOWN THE STAIRS
927-132462-0091 TWO OR THREE TIMES AS THOUGH SUDDENLY STRUCK BY SOME THOUGHT WHEN HE WAS IN THE STREET HE CRIED OUT OH GOD
927-132462-0092 AND CAN I CAN I POSSIBLY
927-132462-0093 HE ADDED RESOLUTELY
927-132462-0094 WHAT FILTHY THINGS MY HEART IS CAPABLE OF YES FILTHY ABOVE ALL DISGUSTING LOATHSOME LOATHSOME
927-132462-0095 BUT NO WORDS NO EXCLAMATIONS COULD EXPRESS HIS AGITATION THE FEELING OF INTENSE REPULSION
927-132462-0096 WHILE HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE OLD WOMAN HAD BY NOW REACHED SUCH A PITCH AND HAD TAKEN SUCH A DEFINITE FORM THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIMSELF TO ESCAPE FROM HIS WRETCHEDNESS
927-132462-0097 HE WALKED ALONG THE PAVEMENT LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN REGARDLESS OF THE PASSERS BY AND JOSTLING AGAINST THEM AND ONLY CAME TO HIS SENSES WHEN HE WAS IN THE NEXT STREET
927-132462-0098 LOOKING ROUND HE NOTICED THAT HE WAS STANDING CLOSE TO A TAVERN WHICH WAS ENTERED BY STEPS LEADING FROM THE PAVEMENT TO THE BASEMENT AT THAT INSTANT TWO DRUNKEN MEN
927-132462-0099 AND ABUSING AND SUPPORTING ONE ANOTHER
927-132462-0100 WITHOUT STOPPING TO THINK RASKOLNIKOV WENT DOWN THE STEPS AT ONCE
927-132462-0101 BUT NOW HE FELT GIDDY AND WAS TORMENTED BY A BURNING THIRST HE LONGED FOR A DRINK OF COLD BEER AND ATTRIBUTED HIS SUDDEN WEAKNESS TO THE WANT OF FOOD
927-132462-0102 HE SAT DOWN AT A STICKY LITTLE TABLE IN A DARK AND DIRTY CORNER
927-132462-0103 AND EAGERLY DRANK OFF THE FIRST GLASSFUL AT ONCE HE FELT EASIER AND HIS THOUGHTS BECAME CLEAR ALL THAT'S NONSENSE HE SAID HOPEFULLY
927-132462-0104 IT'S SIMPLY PHYSICAL DERANGEMENT JUST A GLASS OF BEER A PIECE OF DRY BREAD
927-132462-0105 THE MIND IS CLEARER AND THE WILL IS FIRM PHEW
927-132462-0106 HE WAS BY NOW LOOKING CHEERFUL AS THOUGH HE WERE SUDDENLY SET FREE FROM A TERRIBLE BURDEN AND HE GAZED ROUND IN A FRIENDLY WAY AT THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM BUT EVEN AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD A DIM FOREBODING
927-132462-0107 MIND WAS ALSO NOT NORMAL
927-132462-0108 BESIDES THE TWO DRUNKEN MEN HE HAD MET ON THE STEPS A GROUP CONSISTING OF ABOUT FIVE MEN AND A GIRL
927-132462-0109 HAD GONE OUT AT THE SAME TIME THEIR DEPARTURE LEFT THE ROOM QUIET AND RATHER EMPTY THE PERSONS STILL IN THE TAVERN WERE A MAN WHO APPEARED TO BE AN
927-132462-0110 DRUNK BUT NOT EXTREMELY SO SITTING BEFORE A POT OF BEER AND HIS COMPANION A HUGE STOUT MAN
927-132462-0111 IN A SHORT FULL SKIRTED COAT HE WAS VERY DRUNK AND HAD DROPPED ASLEEP ON THE BENCH EVERY NOW AND THEN HE BEGAN AS THOUGH IN HIS SLEEP
927-132462-0112 WITH HIS ARMS WIDE APART
927-132462-0113 WHILE HE HUMMED SOME MEANINGLESS REFRAIN
927-132462-0114 RECALL SOME SUCH LINES AS THESE
927-132462-0115 OR SUDDENLY WAKING UP AGAIN
927-132462-0116 HIS SILENT COMPANION
927-132462-0117 THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN IN THE ROOM
