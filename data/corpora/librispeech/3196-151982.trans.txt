3196-151982-0000 IT WAS A CLEAR FROSTY JANUARY DAY ON WHICH MISTER TULLIVER FIRST CAME DOWNSTAIRS THE BRIGHT SUN ON THE CHESTNUT BOUGHS AND THE ROOFS OPPOSITE HIS WINDOW HAD MADE HIM IMPATIENTLY DECLARE THAT HE WOULD BE CAGED UP NO LONGER HE THOUGHT EVERYWHERE WOULD BE MORE CHEERY UNDER THIS SUNSHINE THAN HIS BEDROOM
3196-151982-0001 FOR HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE BARENESS BELOW WHICH MADE THE FLOOD OF SUNSHINE IMPORTUNATE
3196-151982-0002 WAS SO CONTINUALLY IMPLIED IN HIS TALK AND THE ATTEMPTS TO CONVEY TO HIM THE IDEA THAT MANY WEEKS HAD PASSED AND MUCH HAD HAPPENED SINCE THEN HAD BEEN SO SOON SWEPT AWAY BY RECURRENT FORGETFULNESS
3196-151982-0003 THIS RESOLUTION TO COME DOWNSTAIRS WAS HEARD WITH TREMBLING BY THE WIFE AND CHILDREN MISSUS TULLIVER SAID TOM MUST NOT GO TO SAINT OGG'S AT THE USUAL HOUR HE MUST WAIT AND SEE HIS FATHER DOWNSTAIRS AND TOM COMPLIED THOUGH WITH AN INTENSE INWARD SHRINKING FROM THE PAINFUL SCENE
3196-151982-0004 THE HEARTS OF ALL THREE HAD BEEN MORE DEEPLY DEJECTED THAN EVER DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS FOR GUEST AND CO HAD NOT BOUGHT THE MILL BOTH MILL AND LAND HAD BEEN KNOCKED DOWN TO WAKEM
3196-151982-0005 WHO HAD BEEN OVER THE PREMISES AND HAD LAID BEFORE MISTER DEANE AND MISTER GLEGG IN MISSUS TULLIVER'S PRESENCE HIS WILLINGNESS TO EMPLOY MISTER TULLIVER IN CASE OF HIS RECOVERY AS A MANAGER OF THE BUSINESS THIS PROPOSITION HAD OCCASIONED MUCH FAMILY DEBATING
3196-151982-0006 THAT SUCH AN OFFER OUGHT NOT TO BE REJECTED WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WAY BUT A FEELING IN MISTER TULLIVER'S MIND WHICH AS NEITHER AUNTS NOR UNCLES SHARED IT WAS REGARDED AS ENTIRELY UNREASONABLE AND CHILDISH
3196-151982-0007 INDEED AS A TRANSFERRING TOWARD WAKEM OF THAT INDIGNATION AND HATRED WHICH MISTER TULLIVER OUGHT PROPERLY TO HAVE DIRECTED AGAINST HIMSELF FOR HIS GENERAL QUARRELSOMENESS AND HIS SPECIAL EXHIBITION OF IT IN GOING TO LAW HERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MISTER TULLIVER TO PROVIDE FOR HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER
3196-151982-0008 WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE FROM HIS WIFE'S RELATIONS AND WITHOUT THAT TOO EVIDENT DESCENT INTO PAUPERISM WHICH MAKES IT ANNOYING TO RESPECTABLE PEOPLE TO MEET THE DEGRADED MEMBER OF THE FAMILY BY THE WAYSIDE MISTER TULLIVER MISSUS GLEGG CONSIDERED MUST BE MADE TO FEEL WHEN HE CAME TO HIS RIGHT MIND
3196-151982-0009 THAT HE COULD NEVER HUMBLE HIMSELF ENOUGH
3196-151982-0010 MISTER GLEGG AND MISTER DEANE WERE LESS STERN IN THEIR VIEWS BUT THEY BOTH OF THEM THOUGHT TULLIVER HAD DONE ENOUGH HARM BY HIS HOT TEMPERED CROTCHETS AND OUGHT TO PUT THEM OUT OF THE QUESTION WHEN A LIVELIHOOD WAS OFFERED HIM WAKEM SHOWED A RIGHT FEELING ABOUT THE MATTER HE HAD NO GRUDGE AGAINST TULLIVER
3196-151982-0011 TOM HAD PROTESTED AGAINST ENTERTAINING THE PROPOSITION HE SHOULDN'T LIKE HIS FATHER TO BE UNDER WAKEM HE THOUGHT IT WOULD LOOK MEAN SPIRITED
3196-151982-0012 WHO SPOKE SO AS NOBODY COULD BE FAIRER INDEED MISSUS TULLIVER'S MIND WAS REDUCED TO SUCH CONFUSION BY LIVING IN THIS STRANGE MEDIUM OF UNACCOUNTABLE SORROW AGAINST WHICH SHE CONTINUALLY APPEALED BY ASKING OH DEAR WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE WORSE THAN OTHER WOMEN
3196-151982-0013 TOM SHE SAID WHEN THEY WERE OUT OF THEIR FATHER'S ROOM TOGETHER WE MUST TRY TO MAKE FATHER UNDERSTAND A LITTLE OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE HE GOES DOWNSTAIRS BUT WE MUST GET MY MOTHER AWAY SHE WILL SAY SOMETHING THAT WILL DO HARM
3196-151982-0014 HAVING DECLARED HER INTENTION OF STAYING TILL THE MASTER COULD GET ABOUT AGAIN WAGE OR NO WAGE SHE HAD FOUND A CERTAIN RECOMPENSE IN KEEPING A STRONG HAND OVER HER MISTRESS SCOLDING HER FOR MOITHERING HERSELF AND GOING ABOUT ALL DAY WITHOUT CHANGING HER CAP AND LOOKING AS IF SHE WAS MUSHED
3196-151982-0015 SHE COULD SCOLD HER BETTERS WITH UNREPROVED FREEDOM ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION THERE WERE DRYING CLOTHES TO BE FETCHED IN SHE WISHED TO KNOW IF ONE PAIR OF HANDS COULD DO EVERYTHING IN DOORS AND OUT AND OBSERVED THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR MISSUS TULLIVER TO PUT ON HER BONNET
3196-151982-0016 AND GET A BREATH OF FRESH AIR BY DOING THAT NEEDFUL PIECE OF WORK POOR MISSUS TULLIVER WENT SUBMISSIVELY DOWNSTAIRS TO BE ORDERED ABOUT BY A SERVANT WAS THE LAST REMNANT OF HER HOUSEHOLD DIGNITIES SHE WOULD SOON HAVE NO SERVANT TO SCOLD HER
3196-151982-0017 MISTER TULLIVER WAS RESTING IN HIS CHAIR A LITTLE AFTER THE FATIGUE OF DRESSING AND MAGGIE AND TOM WERE SEATED NEAR HIM WHEN LUKE ENTERED TO ASK IF HE SHOULD HELP MASTER DOWNSTAIRS AY AY LUKE STOP A BIT SIT DOWN SAID MISTER TULLIVER POINTING HIS STICK TOWARD A CHAIR
3196-151982-0018 AND LOOKING AT HIM WITH THAT PURSUANT GAZE WHICH CONVALESCENT PERSONS OFTEN HAVE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE TENDED THEM REMINDING ONE OF AN INFANT GAZING ABOUT AFTER ITS NURSE FOR LUKE HAD BEEN A CONSTANT NIGHT WATCHER BY HIS MASTER'S BED HOW'S THE WATER NOW EH LUKE SAID MISTER TULLIVER

3196-151982-0020 MISTER TULLIVER LEANED FORWARD RESTING HIS ELBOWS ON THE ARMCHAIR AND LOOKING ON THE GROUND AS IF IN SEARCH OF SOMETHING STRIVING AFTER VANISHING IMAGES LIKE A MAN STRUGGLING AGAINST A DOZE MAGGIE LOOKED AT TOM IN MUTE DISTRESS THEIR FATHER'S MIND WAS SO FAR OFF THE PRESENT
3196-151982-0021 WHICH WOULD BY AND BY THRUST ITSELF ON HIS WANDERING CONSCIOUSNESS TOM WAS ALMOST READY TO RUSH AWAY WITH THAT IMPATIENCE OF PAINFUL EMOTION WHICH MAKES ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOUTH AND MAIDEN MAN AND WOMAN FATHER SAID MAGGIE LAYING HER HAND ON HIS
3196-151982-0022 DON'T YOU REMEMBER THAT MISTER RILEY IS DEAD DEAD SAID MISTER TULLIVER SHARPLY LOOKING IN HER FACE WITH A STRANGE EXAMINING GLANCE YES HE DIED OF APOPLEXY NEARLY A YEAR AGO I REMEMBER HEARING YOU SAY YOU HAD TO PAY MONEY FOR HIM

3196-151982-0024 I'VE BEEN AT SCHOOL THERE THREE YEARS DON'T YOU REMEMBER MISTER TULLIVER THREW HIMSELF BACKWARD AGAIN LOSING THE CHILDLIKE OUTWARD GLANCE UNDER A RUSH OF NEW IDEAS WHICH DIVERTED HIM FROM EXTERNAL IMPRESSIONS
3196-151982-0025 I WAS DETERMINED MY SON SHOULD HAVE A GOOD EDDICATION I'D NONE MYSELF AND I'VE FELT THE MISS OF IT AND HE'LL WANT NO OTHER FORTIN THAT'S WHAT I SAY IF WAKEM WAS TO GET THE BETTER OF ME AGAIN THE THOUGHT OF WAKEM ROUSED NEW VIBRATIONS
3196-151982-0026 AND AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE HE BEGAN TO LOOK AT THE COAT HE HAD ON AND TO FEEL IN HIS SIDE POCKET

3196-151982-0033 AND THESE WORDS WHICH HE HAD USED OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO TOM WHEN HE WANTED TO DECLINE THE FULL PAYMENT OF HIS FIFTY POUNDS OUT OF THE CHILDREN'S MONEY WERE THE MOST READY TO HIS TONGUE THEY WERE JUST THE WORDS TO LAY THE MOST PAINFUL HOLD ON HIS MASTER'S BEWILDERED MIND
