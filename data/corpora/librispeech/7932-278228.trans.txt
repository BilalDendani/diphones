7932-278228-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN MARGARET'S LETTER LIFE SEEMED VERY BLANK TO CLEMENT AUSTIN WHEN HE RETURNED TO LONDON A DAY OR TWO AFTER MARGARET WILMOT'S DEPARTURE FROM THE REINDEER HE TOLD HIS MOTHER THAT HE AND HIS BETROTHED HAD PARTED BUT HE WOULD TELL NO MORE
7932-278228-0001 I HAVE BEEN CRUELLY DISAPPOINTED MOTHER AND THE SUBJECT IS VERY BITTER TO ME HE SAID AND MISSUS AUSTIN HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO ASK ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS I SUPPOSE I MUST BE SATISFIED CLEMENT SHE SAID
7932-278228-0002 IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF WE HAD BEEN LIVING LATELY IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF ENIGMAS BUT I CAN AFFORD TO BE CONTENTED CLEMENT SO LONG AS I HAVE YOU WITH ME CLEMENT WENT BACK TO LONDON HIS LIFE SEEMED TO HAVE ALTOGETHER SLIPPED AWAY FROM HIM
7932-278228-0003 AND HE FELT LIKE AN OLD MAN WHO HAS LOST ALL THE BRIGHT CHANCES OF EXISTENCE THE HOPE OF DOMESTIC HAPPINESS AND A PLEASANT HOME THE OPPORTUNITY OF A USEFUL CAREER AND AN HONOURED NAME
7932-278228-0004 WHOSE CHIEFS WERE EAGER TO SECURE THE WELL KNOWN CASHIER OF MESSRS DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY'S ESTABLISHMENT POOR CLEMENT COULD NOT GO INTO THE WORLD YET HIS DISAPPOINTMENT HAD BEEN TOO BITTER AND HE HAD NO HEART TO GO OUT AMONGST HARD MEN OF BUSINESS AND BEGIN LIFE AGAIN
7932-278228-0005 HE WASTED HOUR AFTER HOUR AND DAY AFTER DAY IN GLOOMY THOUGHTS ABOUT THE PAST WHAT A DUPE HE HAD BEEN WHAT A SHALLOW MISERABLE FOOL FOR HE HAD BELIEVED AS FIRMLY IN MARGARET WILMOT'S TRUTH
7932-278228-0006 AS HE HAD BELIEVED IN THE BLUE SKY ABOVE HIS HEAD ONE DAY A NEW IDEA FLASHED INTO CLEMENT AUSTIN'S MIND AN IDEA WHICH PLACED MARGARET WILMOT'S CHARACTER EVEN IN A WORSE LIGHT THAN THAT IN WHICH SHE HAD REVEALED HERSELF IN HER OWN CONFESSION
7932-278228-0007 THERE COULD BE ONLY ONE REASON FOR THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN HER SENTIMENTS ABOUT HENRY DUNBAR THE MILLIONAIRE HAD BRIBED HER TO SILENCE THIS GIRL WHO SEEMED THE VERY INCARNATION OF PURITY AND CANDOUR HAD HER PRICE PERHAPS AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE
7932-278228-0008 IT WAS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS BUSINESS THAT MADE HER SHRINK AWAY FROM ME THAT NIGHT WHEN SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS A CONTAMINATED CREATURE UNFIT TO BE THE ASSOCIATE OF AN HONEST MAN OH MARGARET MARGARET
7932-278228-0009 POVERTY MUST INDEED BE A BITTER SCHOOL IF IT HAS PREPARED YOU FOR SUCH DEGRADATION AS THIS THE LONGER CLEMENT THOUGHT OF THE SUBJECT THE MORE CERTAINLY HE ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT MARGARET WILMOT HAD BEEN EITHER BRIBED
7932-278228-0010 OR FRIGHTENED INTO SILENCE BY HENRY DUNBAR IT MIGHT BE THAT THE BANKER HAD TERRIFIED THIS UNHAPPY GIRL BY SOME AWFUL THREAT THAT HAD PREYED UPON HER MIND AND DRIVEN HER FROM THE MAN WHO LOVED HER WHOM SHE LOVED PERHAPS
7932-278228-0011 IN SPITE OF THOSE HEARTLESS WORDS WHICH SHE HAD SPOKEN IN THE BITTER HOUR OF THEIR PARTING CLEMENT COULD NOT THOROUGHLY BELIEVE IN THE BASENESS OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TRUSTED AGAIN AND AGAIN HE WENT OVER THE SAME GROUND TRYING TO FIND SOME LURKING CIRCUMSTANCE NO MATTER HOW UNLIKELY IN ITS NATURE
7932-278228-0012 WHICH SHOULD EXPLAIN AND JUSTIFY MARGARET'S CONDUCT SOMETIMES IN HIS DREAMS HE SAW THE FAMILIAR FACE LOOKING AT HIM WITH PENSIVE HALF REPROACHFUL GLANCES AND THEN A DARK FIGURE THAT WAS STRANGE TO HIM CAME BETWEEN HIM AND THAT GENTLE SHADOW
7932-278228-0013 THERE WAS FALSEHOOD AND TREACHERY IN THE BUSINESS BUT MARGARET WILMOT WAS NEITHER FALSE NOR TREACHEROUS THERE WAS A MYSTERY AND HENRY DUNBAR WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF IT IT SEEMS AS IF THE SPIRIT OF THE MURDERED MAN TROUBLED OUR LIVES
7932-278228-0014 AND CRIED TO US FOR VENGEANCE CLEMENT THOUGHT THERE WILL BE NO PEACE FOR US UNTIL THE SECRET OF THE DEED DONE IN THE GROVE NEAR WINCHESTER HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT THIS THOUGHT WORKING NIGHT AND DAY IN CLEMENT AUSTIN'S BRAIN GAVE RISE TO A FIXED RESOLVE
7932-278228-0015 BEFORE HE WENT BACK TO THE QUIET ROUTINE OF LIFE HE SET HIMSELF A TASK TO ACCOMPLISH AND THAT TASK WAS THE SOLUTION OF THE WINCHESTER MYSTERY ON THE VERY DAY AFTER THIS RESOLUTION TOOK A DEFINITE FORM CLEMENT RECEIVED A LETTER FROM MARGARET WILMOT
7932-278228-0016 THE SIGHT OF THE WELL KNOWN WRITING GAVE HIM A SHOCK OF MINGLED SURPRISE AND HOPE AND HIS FINGERS WERE FAINTLY TREMULOUS AS THEY TORE OPEN THE ENVELOPE THE LETTER WAS CAREFULLY WORDED AND VERY BRIEF YOU ARE A GOOD MAN MISTER AUSTIN MARGARET WROTE
7932-278228-0017 AND THOUGH YOU HAVE REASON TO DESPISE ME I DO NOT THINK YOU WILL REFUSE TO RECEIVE MY TESTIMONY IN FAVOUR OF ANOTHER WHO HAS BEEN FALSELY SUSPECTED OF A TERRIBLE CRIME AND WHO HAS NEED OF JUSTIFICATION HENRY DUNBAR WAS NOT THE MURDERER OF MY FATHER
7932-278228-0018 AS HEAVEN IS MY WITNESS THIS IS THE TRUTH AND I KNOW IT TO BE THE TRUTH LET THIS KNOWLEDGE CONTENT YOU AND ALLOW THE SECRET OF THE MURDER TO REMAIN FOR EVER A MYSTERY UPON EARTH GOD KNOWS THE TRUTH AND HAS DOUBTLESS PUNISHED THE WRETCHED SINNER WHO WAS GUILTY OF THAT CRIME
7932-278228-0019 AS HE PUNISHES EVERY OTHER SINNER SOONER OR LATER IN THE COURSE OF HIS INEFFABLE WISDOM LEAVE THE SINNER WHEREVER HE MAY BE HIDDEN TO THE JUDGMENT OF GOD WHICH PENETRATES EVERY HIDING PLACE AND FORGET THAT YOU HAVE EVER KNOWN ME OR MY MISERABLE STORY
7932-278228-0020 MARGARET WILMOT EVEN THIS LETTER DID NOT SHAKE CLEMENT AUSTIN'S RESOLUTION NO MARGARET HE THOUGHT EVEN YOUR PLEADING SHALL NOT TURN ME FROM MY PURPOSE BESIDES HOW CAN I TELL IN WHAT MANNER THIS LETTER MAY HAVE BEEN WRITTEN
7932-278228-0021 IT MAY HAVE BEEN WRITTEN AT HENRY DUNBAR'S DICTATION AND UNDER COERCION BE IT AS IT MAY THE MYSTERY OF THE WINCHESTER MURDER SHALL BE SET AT REST IF PATIENCE OR INTELLIGENCE CAN SOLVE THE ENIGMA NO MYSTERY SHALL SEPARATE ME FROM THE WOMAN I LOVE
7932-278228-0022 CLEMENT PUT MARGARET'S LETTER IN HIS POCKET AND WENT STRAIGHT TO SCOTLAND YARD WHERE HE OBTAINED AN INTRODUCTION TO A BUSINESSLIKE LOOKING MAN SHORT AND STOUTLY BUILT WITH CLOSE CROPPED HAIR VERY LITTLE SHIRT COLLAR A SHABBY BLACK SATIN STOCK
7932-278228-0023 AND THE DECIDED EXPRESSION OF HIS THIN LIPS AND PROMINENT CHIN THE DETECTIVE BUSINESS HAPPENED TO BE RATHER DULL JUST NOW THERE WAS NOTHING STIRRING BUT A BANK OF ENGLAND FORGERY CASE AND MISTER CARTER INFORMED CLEMENT THAT THERE WERE MORE CATS IN SCOTLAND YARD THAN COULD FIND MICE TO KILL
7932-278228-0024 UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MISTER CARTER WAS ABLE TO ENTER INTO CLEMENT'S VIEWS AND SEQUESTRATE HIMSELF FOR A SHORT PERIOD FOR THE MORE DELIBERATE INVESTIGATION OF THE WINCHESTER BUSINESS I'LL LOOK UP A FILE OF NEWSPAPERS AND RUN MY EYE OVER THE DETAILS OF THE CASE
7932-278228-0025 SAID THE DETECTIVE I WAS AWAY IN GLASGOW HUNTING UP THE PARTICULARS OF THE GREAT SCOTCH PLAID ROBBERIES ALL LAST SUMMER AND I CAN'T SAY I REMEMBER MUCH OF WHAT WAS DONE IN THE WILMOT BUSINESS MISTER DUNBAR HIMSELF OFFERED A REWARD FOR THE APPREHENSION OF THE GUILTY PARTY DIDN'T HE
7932-278228-0026 BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND IT MIGHTN'T YOU MUST ALWAYS LOOK AT THESE SORT OF THINGS FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW START WITH A CONVICTION OF THE MAN'S GUILT AND YOU'LL GO HUNTING UP EVIDENCE TO BOLSTER THAT CONVICTION
7932-278228-0027 MY PLAN IS TO BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING LEARN THE ALPHABET OF THE CASE AND WORK UP INTO THE SYNTAX AND PROSODY I SHOULD LIKE TO HELP YOU IN THIS BUSINESS CLEMENT AUSTIN SAID FOR I HAVE A VITAL INTEREST IN THE ISSUE OF THE CASE
7932-278228-0028 YOU'RE RATHER MORE LIKELY TO HINDER THAN HELP SIR MISTER CARTER ANSWERED WITH A SMILE BUT YOU'RE WELCOME TO HAVE A FINGER IN THE PIE IF YOU LIKE AS LONG AS YOU'LL ENGAGE TO HOLD YOUR TONGUE WHEN I TELL YOU CLEMENT PROMISED TO BE THE VERY SPIRIT OF DISCRETION
7932-278228-0029 THE DETECTIVE CALLED UPON HIM TWO DAYS AFTER THE INTERVIEW AT SCOTLAND YARD I'VE READ UP THE WILMOT CASE SIR MISTER CARTER SAID AND I THINK THE NEXT BEST THING I CAN DO IS TO SEE THE SCENE OF THE MURDER I SHALL START FOR WINCHESTER TO MORROW MORNING
