5405-19220-0000 WHAT HAD BECOME OF JEAN VALJEAN IMMEDIATELY AFTER HAVING LAUGHED AT COSETTE'S GRACEFUL COMMAND WHEN NO ONE WAS PAYING ANY HEED TO HIM JEAN VALJEAN HAD RISEN AND HAD GAINED THE ANTECHAMBER UNPERCEIVED
5405-19220-0001 THIS WAS THE VERY ROOM WHICH EIGHT MONTHS BEFORE HE HAD ENTERED BLACK WITH MUD WITH BLOOD AND POWDER BRINGING BACK THE GRANDSON TO THE GRANDFATHER THE OLD WAINSCOTING WAS GARLANDED WITH FOLIAGE AND FLOWERS THE MUSICIANS WERE SEATED ON THE SOFA
5405-19220-0002 ON WHICH THEY HAD LAID MARIUS DOWN BASQUE IN A BLACK COAT KNEE BREECHES WHITE STOCKINGS AND WHITE GLOVES WAS ARRANGING ROSES ROUND ALL OF THE DISHES THAT WERE TO BE SERVED
5405-19220-0003 CHARGED BASQUE TO EXPLAIN HIS ABSENCE AND WENT AWAY THE LONG WINDOWS OF THE DINING ROOM OPENED ON THE STREET
5405-19220-0004 AND RETURNED TO THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME IN ORDER TO RETURN THITHER
5405-19220-0005 AND THE BLANCS MANTEAUX IT WAS A LITTLE LONGER BUT IT WAS THE ROAD THROUGH WHICH FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS HE HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO PASS EVERY DAY ON HIS WAY FROM THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME
5405-19220-0006 THROUGH WHICH COSETTE HAD PASSED EXCLUDED FOR HIM ALL POSSIBILITY OF ANY OTHER ITINERARY
5405-19220-0007 HE LIGHTED HIS CANDLE AND MOUNTED THE STAIRS THE APARTMENT WAS EMPTY EVEN TOUSSAINT WAS NO LONGER THERE
5405-19220-0008 ALL THE CUPBOARDS STOOD OPEN HE PENETRATED TO COSETTE'S BEDROOM THERE WERE NO SHEETS ON THE BED THE PILLOW COVERED WITH TICKING AND WITHOUT A CASE OR LACE WAS LAID ON THE BLANKETS FOLDED UP ON THE FOOT OF THE MATTRESS WHOSE COVERING WAS VISIBLE
5405-19220-0009 AND ON WHICH NO ONE WAS EVER TO SLEEP AGAIN ALL THE LITTLE FEMININE OBJECTS WHICH COSETTE WAS ATTACHED TO HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY NOTHING REMAINED EXCEPT THE HEAVY FURNITURE AND THE FOUR WALLS TOUSSAINT'S BED WAS DESPOILED IN LIKE MANNER
5405-19220-0010 ONE BED ONLY WAS MADE UP AND SEEMED TO BE WAITING SOME ONE
5405-19220-0011 JEAN VALJEAN LOOKED AT THE WALLS CLOSED SOME OF THE CUPBOARD DOORS AND WENT AND CAME FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER THEN HE SOUGHT HIS OWN CHAMBER ONCE MORE AND SET HIS CANDLE ON A TABLE HE HAD DISENGAGED HIS ARM FROM THE SLING
5405-19220-0012 AND HE USED HIS RIGHT HAND AS THOUGH IT DID NOT HURT HIM HE APPROACHED HIS BED AND HIS EYES RESTED WAS IT BY CHANCE WAS IT INTENTIONALLY ON THE INSEPARABLE OF WHICH COSETTE HAD BEEN JEALOUS ON THE LITTLE PORTMANTEAU WHICH NEVER LEFT HIM
5405-19220-0013 ON HIS ARRIVAL IN THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME ON THE FOURTH OF JUNE HE HAD DEPOSITED IT ON A ROUND TABLE NEAR THE HEAD OF HIS BED HE WENT TO THIS TABLE WITH A SORT OF VIVACITY TOOK A KEY FROM HIS POCKET AND OPENED THE VALISE
5405-19220-0014 FROM IT HE SLOWLY DREW FORTH THE GARMENTS IN WHICH TEN YEARS BEFORE
5405-19220-0015 FIRST THE LITTLE GOWN THEN THE BLACK FICHU THEN THE STOUT COARSE CHILD'S SHOES WHICH COSETTE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE WORN STILL SO TINY WERE HER FEET THEN THE FUSTIAN BODICE WHICH WAS VERY THICK
5405-19220-0016 THEN THE KNITTED PETTICOAT NEXT THE APRON WITH POCKETS THEN THE WOOLLEN STOCKINGS THESE STOCKINGS WHICH STILL PRESERVED THE GRACEFUL FORM OF A TINY LEG WERE NO LONGER THAN JEAN VALJEAN'S HAND ALL THIS WAS BLACK OF HUE
5405-19220-0017 HE LAID THEM ON THE BED HE FELL TO THINKING HE CALLED UP MEMORIES IT WAS IN WINTER IN A VERY COLD MONTH OF DECEMBER SHE WAS SHIVERING HALF NAKED IN RAGS HER POOR LITTLE FEET WERE ALL RED IN THEIR WOODEN SHOES
5405-19220-0018 THE MOTHER MUST HAVE FELT PLEASED IN HER GRAVE TO SEE HER DAUGHTER WEARING MOURNING FOR HER AND ABOVE ALL TO SEE THAT SHE WAS PROPERLY CLOTHED AND THAT SHE WAS WARM
5405-19220-0019 THEY HAD TRAVERSED IT TOGETHER COSETTE AND HE HE THOUGHT OF WHAT THE WEATHER HAD BEEN OF THE LEAFLESS TREES OF THE WOOD DESTITUTE OF BIRDS OF THE SUNLESS SKY IT MATTERED NOT IT WAS CHARMING HE ARRANGED THE TINY GARMENTS ON THE BED
5405-19220-0020 THE FICHU NEXT TO THE PETTICOAT THE STOCKINGS BESIDE THE SHOES AND HE LOOKED AT THEM ONE AFTER THE OTHER SHE WAS NO TALLER THAN THAT
5405-19220-0021 SHE HAD LAUGHED THEY WALKED HAND IN HAND SHE HAD NO ONE IN THE WORLD BUT HIM THEN HIS VENERABLE WHITE HEAD FELL FORWARD ON THE BED THAT STOICAL OLD HEART BROKE HIS FACE WAS ENGULFED SO TO SPEAK IN COSETTE'S GARMENTS
5405-19220-0022 AND IF ANY ONE HAD PASSED UP THE STAIRS AT THAT MOMENT HE WOULD HAVE HEARD FRIGHTFUL SOBS
5405-19220-0023 BEGAN ONCE MORE JACOB STRUGGLED WITH THE ANGEL BUT ONE NIGHT
5405-19220-0024 CLASPED AND OVERTHROWN HIM HOW MANY TIMES HAD THE TRUTH SET HER KNEE INEXORABLY UPON HIS BREAST HOW MANY TIMES HURLED TO EARTH BY THE LIGHT HAD HE BEGGED FOR MERCY HOW MANY TIMES HAD THAT IMPLACABLE SPARK LIGHTED WITHIN HIM
5405-19220-0025 AND UPON HIM BY THE BISHOP DAZZLED HIM BY FORCE WHEN HE HAD WISHED TO BE BLIND HOW MANY TIMES HAD HE RISEN TO HIS FEET IN THE COMBAT HELD FAST TO THE ROCK
5405-19220-0026 DRAGGED IN THE DUST NOW GETTING THE UPPER HAND OF HIS CONSCIENCE AGAIN OVERTHROWN BY IT HOW MANY TIMES AFTER AN EQUIVOQUE
5405-19220-0027 HAD HE HEARD HIS IRRITATED CONSCIENCE CRY IN HIS EAR A TRIP YOU WRETCH HOW MANY TIMES HAD HIS REFRACTORY THOUGHTS RATTLED CONVULSIVELY IN HIS THROAT UNDER THE EVIDENCE OF DUTY RESISTANCE TO GOD FUNEREAL SWEATS
5405-19220-0028 WHAT SECRET WOUNDS WHICH HE ALONE FELT BLEED WHAT EXCORIATIONS IN HIS LAMENTABLE EXISTENCE
5405-19220-0029 ENLIGHTENED DESPAIR IN HIS HEART SERENITY IN HIS SOUL AND VANQUISHED HE HAD FELT HIMSELF THE CONQUEROR AND AFTER HAVING DISLOCATED BROKEN AND RENT HIS CONSCIENCE WITH RED HOT PINCERS
5405-19220-0030 IT HAD SAID TO HIM AS IT STOOD OVER HIM FORMIDABLE LUMINOUS AND TRANQUIL NOW GO IN PEACE BUT ON EMERGING FROM SO MELANCHOLY A CONFLICT WHAT A LUGUBRIOUS PEACE ALAS
5405-19220-0031 A HEART RENDING QUESTION PRESENTED ITSELF PREDESTINATIONS ARE NOT ALL DIRECT THEY DO NOT OPEN OUT IN A STRAIGHT AVENUE BEFORE THE PREDESTINED MAN THEY HAVE BLIND COURTS IMPASSABLE ALLEYS OBSCURE TURNS
5405-19220-0032 HE HAD COME TO THE SUPREME CROSSING OF GOOD AND EVIL HE HAD THAT GLOOMY INTERSECTION BENEATH HIS EYES ON THIS OCCASION ONCE MORE AS HAD HAPPENED TO HIM ALREADY IN OTHER SAD VICISSITUDES TWO ROADS OPENED OUT BEFORE HIM
5405-19220-0033 THE ONE TEMPTING THE OTHER ALARMING WHICH WAS HE TO TAKE HE WAS COUNSELLED TO THE ONE WHICH ALARMED HIM BY THAT MYSTERIOUS INDEX FINGER WHICH WE ALL PERCEIVE WHENEVER WE FIX OUR EYES ON THE DARKNESS
5405-19220-0034 OF COSETTE AND MARIUS IT WAS HE WHO HAD WILLED THAT HAPPINESS IT WAS HE WHO HAD BROUGHT IT ABOUT HE HAD HIMSELF BURIED IT IN HIS ENTRAILS AND AT THAT MOMENT WHEN HE REFLECTED ON IT HE WAS ABLE TO ENJOY THE SORT OF SATISFACTION
5405-19220-0035 WHICH AN ARMORER WOULD EXPERIENCE ON RECOGNIZING HIS FACTORY MARK ON A KNIFE ON WITHDRAWING IT ALL SMOKING FROM HIS OWN BREAST COSETTE HAD MARIUS MARIUS POSSESSED COSETTE THEY HAD EVERYTHING EVEN RICHES AND THIS WAS HIS DOING
5405-19220-0036 NOW THAT IT WAS THERE SHOULD HE FORCE HIMSELF ON THIS HAPPINESS SHOULD HE TREAT IT AS BELONGING TO HIM NO DOUBT COSETTE DID BELONG TO ANOTHER BUT SHOULD HE JEAN VALJEAN RETAIN OF COSETTE ALL THAT HE COULD RETAIN
5405-19220-0037 SHOULD HE REMAIN THE SORT OF FATHER HALF SEEN BUT RESPECTED WHICH HE HAD HITHERTO BEEN SHOULD HE WITHOUT SAYING A WORD BRING HIS PAST TO THAT FUTURE SHOULD HE PRESENT HIMSELF THERE AS THOUGH HE HAD A RIGHT
5405-19220-0038 AND SHOULD HE SEAT HIMSELF VEILED AT THAT LUMINOUS FIRESIDE SHOULD HE TAKE THOSE INNOCENT HANDS INTO HIS TRAGIC HANDS WITH A SMILE
5405-19220-0039 WHICH DRAGGED BEHIND THEM THE DISGRACEFUL SHADOW OF THE LAW SHOULD HE ENTER INTO PARTICIPATION IN THE FAIR FORTUNES OF COSETTE AND MARIUS SHOULD HE RENDER THE OBSCURITY ON HIS BROW AND THE CLOUD UPON THEIRS STILL MORE DENSE
5405-19220-0040 SHOULD HE PLACE HIS CATASTROPHE AS A THIRD ASSOCIATE IN THEIR FELICITY SHOULD HE CONTINUE TO HOLD HIS PEACE IN A WORD SHOULD HE BE THE SINISTER MUTE OF DESTINY BESIDE THESE TWO HAPPY BEINGS
5405-19220-0041 GOOD OR EVIL STANDS BEHIND THIS SEVERE INTERROGATION POINT
5405-19220-0042 HE GAZED INTENTLY AT THE SPHINX HE EXAMINED THE PITILESS PROBLEM UNDER ALL ITS ASPECTS COSETTE THAT CHARMING EXISTENCE WAS THE RAFT OF THIS SHIPWRECK WHAT WAS HE TO DO
5405-19220-0043 IF HE CLUNG TO IT HE SHOULD EMERGE FROM DISASTER HE SHOULD ASCEND AGAIN INTO THE SUNLIGHT HE SHOULD LET THE BITTER WATER DRIP FROM HIS GARMENTS AND HIS HAIR HE WAS SAVED HE SHOULD LIVE AND IF HE LET GO HIS HOLD THEN THE ABYSS
5405-19220-0044 THUS HE TOOK SAD COUNCIL WITH HIS THOUGHTS OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY HE FOUGHT HE KICKED FURIOUSLY INTERNALLY NOW AGAINST HIS WILL NOW AGAINST HIS CONVICTION
5405-19220-0045 THAT RELIEVED HIM POSSIBLY BUT THE BEGINNING WAS SAVAGE
5405-19220-0046 HE COMPARED THEM AND SOBBED
5405-19220-0047 HE FELT THAT HE HAD BEEN STOPPED SHORT ALAS IN THIS FIGHT TO THE DEATH BETWEEN OUR EGOTISM AND OUR DUTY WHEN WE THUS RETREAT STEP BY STEP
5405-19220-0048 BEWILDERED FURIOUS EXASPERATED AT HAVING TO YIELD DISPUTING THE GROUND HOPING FOR A POSSIBLE FLIGHT SEEKING AN ESCAPE WHAT AN ABRUPT AND SINISTER RESISTANCE DOES THE FOOT OF THE WALL OFFER IN OUR REAR
5405-19220-0049 TO FEEL THE SACRED SHADOW WHICH FORMS AN OBSTACLE THE INVISIBLE INEXORABLE WHAT AN OBSESSION THEN ONE IS NEVER DONE WITH CONSCIENCE MAKE YOUR CHOICE BRUTUS MAKE YOUR CHOICE CATO
5405-19220-0050 IT IS FATHOMLESS SINCE IT IS GOD ONE FLINGS INTO THAT WELL THE LABOR OF ONE'S WHOLE LIFE ONE FLINGS IN ONE'S FORTUNE ONE FLINGS IN ONE'S RICHES ONE FLINGS IN ONE'S SUCCESS ONE FLINGS IN ONE'S LIBERTY OR FATHERLAND
5405-19220-0051 ONE FLINGS IN ONE'S WELL BEING ONE FLINGS IN ONE'S REPOSE ONE FLINGS IN ONE'S JOY MORE MORE MORE EMPTY THE VASE TIP THE URN ONE MUST FINISH BY FLINGING IN ONE'S HEART
5405-19220-0052 SOMEWHERE IN THE FOG OF THE ANCIENT HELLS THERE IS A TUN LIKE THAT IS NOT ONE PARDONABLE IF ONE AT LAST REFUSES
5405-19220-0053 ARE NOT CHAINS WHICH ARE ENDLESS ABOVE HUMAN STRENGTH
5405-19220-0054 THE OBEDIENCE OF MATTER IS LIMITED BY FRICTION IS THERE NO LIMIT TO THE OBEDIENCE OF THE SOUL IF PERPETUAL MOTION IS IMPOSSIBLE CAN PERPETUAL SELF SACRIFICE BE EXACTED THE FIRST STEP IS NOTHING IT IS THE LAST WHICH IS DIFFICULT
5405-19220-0055 AND OF THAT WHICH IT ENTAILED WHAT IS A RE ENTRANCE INTO THE GALLEYS COMPARED TO ENTRANCE INTO THE VOID OH FIRST STEP THAT MUST BE DESCENDED HOW SOMBRE ART THOU OH SECOND STEP HOW BLACK ART THOU HOW COULD HE REFRAIN FROM TURNING ASIDE HIS HEAD THIS TIME
5405-19220-0056 MARTYRDOM IS SUBLIMATION CORROSIVE SUBLIMATION IT IS A TORTURE WHICH CONSECRATES ONE CAN CONSENT TO IT FOR THE FIRST HOUR ONE SEATS ONESELF ON THE THRONE OF GLOWING IRON ONE PLACES ON ONE'S HEAD THE CROWN OF HOT IRON
5405-19220-0057 ONE ACCEPTS THE GLOBE OF RED HOT IRON ONE TAKES THE SCEPTRE OF RED HOT IRON BUT THE MANTLE OF FLAME STILL REMAINS TO BE DONNED AND COMES THERE NOT A MOMENT WHEN THE MISERABLE FLESH REVOLTS AND WHEN ONE ABDICATES FROM SUFFERING
5405-19220-0058 HE WEIGHED HE REFLECTED HE CONSIDERED THE ALTERNATIVES THE MYSTERIOUS BALANCE OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS SHOULD HE IMPOSE HIS GALLEYS ON THOSE TWO DAZZLING CHILDREN OR SHOULD HE CONSUMMATE HIS IRREMEDIABLE ENGULFMENT BY HIMSELF
5405-19220-0059 ON ONE SIDE LAY THE SACRIFICE OF COSETTE ON THE OTHER THAT OF HIMSELF AT WHAT SOLUTION SHOULD HE ARRIVE WHAT DECISION DID HE COME TO WHAT RESOLUTION DID HE TAKE WHAT WAS HIS OWN INWARD DEFINITIVE RESPONSE
5405-19220-0060 TO THE UNBRIBABLE INTERROGATORY OF FATALITY WHAT DOOR DID HE DECIDE TO OPEN WHICH SIDE OF HIS LIFE DID HE RESOLVE UPON CLOSING AND CONDEMNING AMONG ALL THE UNFATHOMABLE PRECIPICES WHICH SURROUNDED HIM WHICH WAS HIS CHOICE
5405-19220-0061 WHAT EXTREMITY DID HE ACCEPT TO WHICH OF THE GULFS DID HE NOD HIS HEAD HIS DIZZY REVERY LASTED ALL NIGHT LONG HE REMAINED THERE UNTIL DAYLIGHT IN THE SAME ATTITUDE BENT DOUBLE OVER THAT BED PROSTRATE BENEATH THE ENORMITY OF FATE
5405-19220-0062 CRUSHED PERCHANCE ALAS WITH CLENCHED FISTS WITH ARMS OUTSPREAD AT RIGHT ANGLES LIKE A MAN CRUCIFIED WHO HAS BEEN UN NAILED AND FLUNG FACE DOWN ON THE EARTH THERE HE REMAINED FOR TWELVE HOURS
5405-19220-0063 ICE COLD WITHOUT ONCE RAISING HIS HEAD AND WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HE WAS AS MOTIONLESS AS A CORPSE WHILE HIS THOUGHTS WALLOWED ON THE EARTH AND SOARED NOW LIKE THE HYDRA NOW LIKE THE EAGLE ANY ONE TO BEHOLD HIM THUS MOTIONLESS
5405-19220-0064 ALL AT ONCE HE SHUDDERED CONVULSIVELY AND HIS MOUTH GLUED TO COSETTE'S GARMENTS KISSED THEM THEN IT COULD BE SEEN THAT HE WAS ALIVE WHO COULD SEE
