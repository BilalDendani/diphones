8152-258974-0000 AS THE FIELD AND ITS FERTILE QUALITIES AND THOSE CALLED ARTIFICIAL AS IMPROVEMENTS AND MACHINERY ACCORDING AS THESE RESOURCES ARE MORE OR LESS DEVELOPED AS LABOR IS EMPLOYED IN A FERTILE OR A BARREN FIELD WITH A SHARP TOOL OR A DULL ONE
8152-258974-0001 WITH A HIGHLY DEVELOPED MACHINE OR A POOR ONE THE PRODUCT IS MORE OR LESS IF RESOURCES WERE MUCH MORE ABUNDANT THAN AT PRESENT MANY GOODS NOW SCARCE WOULD BECOME ALMOST OR QUITE FREE
8152-258974-0002 DUE TO MATERIAL AGENTS A CERTAIN PART TO LABOR
8152-258974-0003 THAT ARE GETTING GOOD WAGES ENJOY ABUNDANT FOOD AND CREATURE COMFORTS POORLY PAID WORKERS GO SCANTILY FED THE QUESTION ARISES WHICH IS CAUSE WHICH EFFECT
8152-258974-0004 SOME MAINTAIN THAT ALL THAT IS NEEDED TO MAKE WORKMEN MORE EFFICIENT IS TO FEED THEM WELL IN SOME CASES THIS IS PROBABLY TRUE THE PORTO RICANS ENLISTED IN THE AMERICAN REGULAR ARMY ARE REPORTED TO HAVE INCREASED AT ONCE IN STRENGTH
8152-258974-0005 WEIGHT AND VIGOR THE FILIPINO RECRUITS THANKS TO THE AMERICAN ARMY RATIONS SOON OUTGREW THEIR UNIFORMS SOME EMPLOYERS IN EUROPE PAY THEIR WORKMEN AN EXTRA SUM ON CONDITION THAT IT IS SPENT FOR MEAT
8152-258974-0006 BUT IF WAGES INCREASE IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT MORE OR BETTER FOOD WILL BE BOUGHT OR IF IT IS THAT THE WORKMEN'S POWERS WILL BE INCREASED THERE IS A LIMIT TO THE BENEFITS OF INCREASING FOOD
8152-258974-0007 THERE IS SOME REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IN AMERICA GREAT NUMBERS OF OUR PEOPLE PERHAPS EVEN MANY MANUAL LABORERS WOULD BE BETTER OFF IF THEY BOUGHT SIMPLER AND LESS COSTLY FOOD
8152-258974-0008 THE MAXIMUM OF HEALTH AND VIGOR MAY BE ATTAINED WITH MODERATE OUTLAY AND BEYOND THAT POINT RICHER FOOD
8152-258974-0009 THOUGH ALIKE IN BREED AND AGE THE GROUPS BEGAN AT ONCE TO DIFFER IN CHARACTER ONE GROUP SQUEALED MORE ANOTHER SCRATCHED MORE ANOTHER WAXED FAT FASTER
8152-258974-0010 AND FINALLY WERE BUTCHERED HUNG UP AND PHOTOGRAPHED AT THAT SAME TIME AT THE ELMIRA REFORMATORY MISTER BROCKWAY WAS EXPERIMENTING ON SOME CRIMINALS OF THE LOWER CLASS THEY WERE GIVEN DAILY BATHS SPECIAL PHYSICAL EXERCISES
8152-258974-0011 AND WERE FED ON A SPECIALLY BOUNTIFUL DIET SCIENTIFIC PHILANTHROPY STOPPED THERE BUT PHOTOGRAPHS BEFORE AND AFTER REPRODUCED IN THE PRINTED REPORTS SHOW THE GREAT PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENT THAT RESULTED
8152-258974-0012 AND A MARKED CHANGE OCCURRED LIKEWISE IN DISPOSITION AND INTELLIGENCE MANY LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE OF LATE TO TEST THE CHEMICAL NATURE AND THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF FOODS
8152-258974-0013 IT IS BECOMING MORE FULLY RECOGNIZED THAT THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF FOOD AND THE COOKING OF IT
8152-258974-0014 THE COST OF CLOTHING ENOUGH FOR COMFORT IS HOWEVER COMPARATIVELY SMALL THE AMOUNT SPENT FOR ORNAMENT IS COMPARATIVELY HIGH
8152-258974-0015 SUNSHINE GOOD WATER AND UNBOUNDED NATURAL PLAYGROUNDS FOR CHILDREN WHERE THEY CAN GROW INTO STRONG AND EFFICIENT MANHOOD ARE FREE GOODS AS POPULATION GROWS MORE DENSE THESE THINGS BECOME MORE DIFFICULT TO SECURE
8152-258974-0016 MEN ARE BROUGHT INTO UNNATURAL CONDITIONS THE EVILS OF SLUM AND FACTORY LIFE DEVELOP AND THE HOUSING PROBLEM APPEARS
8152-258974-0017 IF THE INDIVIDUAL CHOSE TO LIVE AND WORK IN UNSUITABLE PLACES AND UNDER UNSANITARY CONDITIONS IT WAS USUALLY HIS OWN FAULT AND HE BORE THE CONSEQUENCES WHEN THE UNSANITARY CONDITIONS ABOUT EACH FAMILY ARE VISITED UPON ITS NEIGHBORS
8152-258974-0018 SOCIETY MUST DEAL WITH THEM ENGINEERING SANITARY SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
8152-258974-0019 MEN IN HIGH EXECUTIVE POSITIONS ARE ABLE TO MAKE OR MAR THE FORTUNES OF THEIR FOLLOWERS SOMETIMES A LEGISLATOR FROM A COUNTRY TOWN GOES TO THE STATE CAPITAL POOR AND RETURNS RICH SUCH THINGS BECOMING GENERALLY KNOWN
8152-258974-0020 TEND TO BREAK DOWN THE MOTIVES TO INDUSTRY THEY BREED THE NOTION THAT WEALTH IS MORE DEPENDENT ON CHANCE OR JOBBERY THAN ON EFFICIENT SERVICE DISHONESTY IN PRIVATE BUSINESS MEANS THE USE OF ENERGY NOT TO PRODUCE WEALTH
8152-258974-0021 IT IS NOT SO HARD TO LIVE SAYS THE HUNGRY CREOLE DAUGHTER IN THE GRANDISSIMES BUT IT IS HARD TO BE LADIES WE ARE COMPELLED NOT TO MAKE A LIVING LOOK AT ME I CAN COOK BUT I MUST NOT COOK I AM SKILFUL WITH THE NEEDLE
8152-258974-0022 BUT I MUST NOT TAKE IN SEWING I COULD KEEP ACCOUNTS I COULD NURSE THE SICK BUT I MUST NOT NOWHERE IN THE WORLD IS THERE LESS CASTE THAN IN AMERICA BUT IT IS HERE
8152-258974-0023 THE NEGRO'S LOW MEASURE OF INDUSTRIAL VIRTUES IS PARTLY THE CAUSE OF THE PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM BUT IN TURN DOUBTLESS INHERITED CLASS FEELING IS IN SOME MEASURE THE CAUSE OF HIS INEFFICIENCY
8152-258974-0024 THEY LEAD TO GREATER ENERGY AND TO A FASTER WORKING PACE IN ALL GRADES OF LABOR THAN IS FOUND ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
8152-258974-0025 TO WESTERN EYES ALREADY THE YOUNG MEN IN THE OLDER EAST SEEM TO BE TRAMMELED BY SOCIAL CONVENTIONS IN AN OLDER COMMUNITY THERE IS LESS OF HOPEFUL AMBITION ONE'S POSITION DEPENDS MORE ON WHAT HIS FATHERS ACHIEVED
8152-258974-0026 IF FOUR HOURS WORK A DAY WOULD ENABLE HIM TO LIVE WILL HE WORK LONGER OR WILL HE STOP THE ANSWER IS DETERMINED BY THE BALANCE OF UTILITY AND DISUTILITY
8152-258974-0027 WILL ADDITIONAL HOURS OF LABOR YIELD MORE GRATIFICATION THAN IDLENESS YIELDS DOES THE PAIN OF TOIL REPEL MORE THAN ITS FRUITS ATTRACT THE USE MADE OF SPARE TIME DIFFERS ACCORDING TO CLIMATE RACE AND TEMPERAMENT
8152-258974-0028 IN THE TROPICS THE MARGIN IS CONVERTED USUALLY INTO LOAFING IN THE TEMPERATE ZONES LARGELY INTO OBJECTIVE FORMS OF ENJOYMENT INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES ARE PLAINLY SEEN WHEN EACH MAN LABORS ON HIS OWN FIELD THE PRUDENT MAN IN THE OLD MAXIMS
8152-258974-0029 INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES ARE STILL EXPRESSED HOWEVER IN IRREGULARITY OF EMPLOYMENT IN THE SOUTH SOME MANUFACTURERS HAVE FOUND THAT ON AN AVERAGE THE NEGROES WILL WORK IN A FACTORY NOT MORE THAN FIVE OR SIX HOURS A DAY
8152-258974-0030 DIVISION OF LABOR IS A TERM EXPRESSING THAT COMPLEX ARRANGEMENT OF INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY WHEREBY INDIVIDUAL WORKERS ARE ENABLED TO APPLY THEMSELVES TO THE PRODUCTION OF CERTAIN KINDS OF GOODS SECURING OTHERS BY EXCHANGE
8152-258974-0031 THE TERM DIVISION OF LABOR IS SIMPLE BUT THE THOUGHT IS A COMPLEX ONE ITS FULL DISCUSSION WOULD COVER THE WHOLE FIELD OF POLITICAL ECONOMY BUT ONLY ITS MOST ESSENTIAL ASPECTS CAN HERE BE TOUCHED UPON
8152-258974-0032 DIVISION OF LABOR AND EXCHANGE ARE COUNTERPARTS AND MUTUALLY DETERMINE EACH OTHER DIVISION OF LABOR DEPENDS ON THE EXTENT OF THE MARKET AND IN TURN WIDENS ITS LIMITS
8152-258974-0033 A INCREASING SKILL B SAVING TIME
8152-258974-0034 SAVING TOOLS AND MATERIALS D IMPROVING QUALITY E INCREASING KNOWLEDGE F STIMULATING INVENTION G ENCOURAGING ENTERPRISE H ECONOMIZING TALENT
8152-258974-0035 IT IS NONE TOO MANY AS EVERY REASON FOR THE MODERN AS CONTRASTED WITH THE PRIMITIVE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY SHOULD BE INCLUDED THE PHRASE DIVISION OF LABOR IS BUT A SYNONYM FOR SPECIALIZATION
8152-258974-0036 A WORD THAT EXPRESSES ALL THAT IS MOST CHARACTERISTIC OF OUR COMPLEX INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY THE HEADINGS JUST GIVEN MAY SERVE HOWEVER TO SUGGEST THE LEADING PHASES OF THE SUBJECT REPETITION OF THE SAME TASK TRAINS THE MUSCLES FORMS A MENTAL HABIT
8152-258974-0037 AND GIVES THE SWIFTNESS AND DEFTNESS OF TOUCH CALLED SKILL SPECIALIZATION SAVES TIME BY MAKING UNNECESSARY THE PHYSICAL CHANGE OF PLACE FOR THE WORKER THE FREQUENT SHIFTING OF TOOLS AND THE MENTAL READJUSTMENT REQUIRED FOR THE UNDERTAKING OF A NEW TASK
8152-258974-0038 SPECIALIZATION SAVES TOOLS FOR EITHER EACH KIND OF WORK MUST BE MOST INEFFECTIVELY DONE OR THERE MUST BE PROVIDED FOR EACH WORKER A COMPLETE SET OF TOOLS WHICH THUS WILL BE USED RARELY
8152-258974-0039 AND WILL RUST OUT RATHER THAN WEAR OUT IF A FEW TOOLS ARE THOROUGHLY USED THEY YIELD A LARGER INCOME ON THE INVESTMENT AND REQUIRE LESS CARE AND REPAIRS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR USES IN FACT
8152-258974-0040 THIS FULLER ECONOMIC USE OF MACHINERY AND PLANT WHERE A LARGE PRODUCT IS TURNED OUT AT ONE PLACE IS A PRIME FACTOR IN THE ADVANTAGES OF LARGE PRODUCTION A SUBJECT TO BE TREATED ELSEWHERE MUCH MORE FULLY THAN IS HERE POSSIBLE
8152-258974-0041 BY SPECIALIZATION IS MADE POSSIBLE A QUALITY OF GOODS NEVER TO BE SECURED BY THE LESS SKILLED EFFORTS OF THE JACK OF ALL TRADES THE SPECIALIST STEADILY GROWS IN KNOWLEDGE OF HIS MATERIALS AND OF THE BEST PROCESSES
8152-258974-0042 BY DIVIDING AND SIMPLIFYING PROCESSES SPECIALIZATION STIMULATES INVENTION THE MOST COMPLEX MACHINES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED GRADUALLY BY COMBINATIONS AND ADAPTATIONS OF SIMPLE TOOLS AND THE MORE A PROCESS IS SUBDIVIDED
8152-258974-0043 THE GREATER IS THE CHANCE OF HITTING UPON A DEVICE TO REPEAT MECHANICALLY THE FEW SIMPLE MOVEMENTS DIVISION OF LABOR INCREASES THE MOTIVES OF EMULATION AND ENTERPRISE BY MAKING POSSIBLE THE MORE EXACT COMPARISON OF RESULTS
8152-258974-0044 IT ECONOMIZES TALENT BY GIVING TO EACH THE HIGHEST TASK OF WHICH HE IS CAPABLE WHILE FITTING THE LESS EFFICIENT WORKERS INTO THE MINOR PLACES MADE POSSIBLE BY SUBDIVISION IN AN AMERICAN WAGON FACTORY
8152-258974-0045 A ONE ARMED MAN OPERATING A MACHINE IS TURNING OUT AS LARGE A PRODUCT AND EARNING AS HIGH WAGES AS ANY OTHER EMPLOYEE
8152-258974-0046 YET THE SLIGHT REFLECTION GIVEN TO THE CHOICE OF AN OCCUPATION BY MOST YOUNG PEOPLE GIVES TO THIS STATEMENT A VERY PRACTICAL BEARING THE WORLD IS FILLED WITH INDUSTRIAL MISFITS ROUND MEN IN SQUARE HOLES GOOD CARPENTERS SPOILED TO MAKE POOR DOCTORS
8152-258974-0047 LEAST CONSIDERED UNREASONING IMITATION FAMILY TRADITIONS PARENTAL WISHES CLASS PRIDE SOCIAL PREJUDICE CHILDISH WHIM ARE OFTEN DECISIVE OF THE LIFE CAREER
8152-258974-0048 HAPPILY IN SOME CASES BEFORE TOO LATE THE MAN FINDS HIMSELF BUT TOO OFTEN THE POVERTY OF THE FAMILY AND THE OBSTACLES TO EDUCATION PRECLUDE THE EXERCISE OF INTELLIGENT CHOICE
8152-258974-0049 IT IS OF IMPORTANCE TO SOCIETY AS WELL AS TO THE INDIVIDUAL THAT TALENT SHOULD BE DISCOVERED IN TIME THAT TASKS SHOULD BE FITTED TO APTITUDES THAT EACH MEMBER OF SOCIETY SHOULD ATTAIN TO HIS HIGHEST EFFICIENCY
