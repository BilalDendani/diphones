8009-283568-0000 IN THE CITY WHERE DAVY LIVED THE STORM PLAYED ALL MANNER OF PRANKS SWOOPING DOWN UPON UNWARY OLD GENTLEMEN AND TURNING THEIR UMBRELLAS WRONG SIDE OUT AND SOMETIMES BLOWING THEIR HATS QUITE OUT OF SIGHT
8009-283568-0001 AND AS FOR THE OLD LADIES WHO CHANCED TO BE OUT OF DOORS THE WIND CAME UPON THEM
8009-283568-0002 AND TWISTED THEIR PETTICOATS ABOUT THEIR ANKLES AND EVEN WHIRLED THE OLD LADIES THEMSELVES ABOUT IN A VERY PAINFUL WAY AND IN THE COUNTRY WHERE DAVY HAD COME TO PASS CHRISTMAS WITH HIS DEAR OLD GRANDMOTHER
8009-283568-0003 THINGS WERE NOT MUCH BETTER BUT HERE PEOPLE WERE VERY WISE ABOUT THE WEATHER AND STAYED IN DOORS HUDDLED AROUND GREAT BLAZING WOOD FIRES AND THE STORM FINDING NO LIVE GAME BURIED UP THE ROADS AND THE FENCES
8009-283568-0004 AND SUCH SMALL FRY OF HOUSES AS COULD READILY BE PUT OUT OF SIGHT AND HOWLED AND ROARED OVER THE FIELDS AND THROUGH THE TREES IN A FASHION NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN DAVY BEING OF THE OPINION THAT A SNOW STORM
8009-283568-0005 WAS A THING NOT TO BE WASTED HAD BEEN OUT WITH HIS SLED TRYING TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN WITH THE WEATHER BUT PRESENTLY DISCOVERING THAT THIS PARTICULAR STORM WAS NOT FRIENDLY TO LITTLE BOYS
8009-283568-0006 HE HAD RETREATED INTO THE HOUSE AND HAVING PUT HIS HAT AND HIS HIGH SHOES AND HIS MITTENS BY THE KITCHEN FIRE TO DRY HE BEGAN TO FIND HIS TIME HANG HEAVILY ON HIS HANDS
8009-283568-0007 HE HAD WANDERED IDLY ALL OVER THE HOUSE AND HAD TRIED HOW COLD HIS NOSE COULD BE MADE BY HOLDING IT AGAINST THE WINDOW PANES
8009-283568-0008 THE BALUSTERS AND TEASING THE CAT AND AT LAST AS EVENING WAS COMING ON HAD CURLED HIMSELF UP IN THE BIG EASY CHAIR FACING THE FIRE
8009-283568-0009 AND HAD BEGUN TO READ ONCE MORE ABOUT THE MARVELLOUS THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO LITTLE ALICE IN WONDERLAND THEN AS IT GREW DARKER HE LAID ASIDE THE BOOK AND SAT WATCHING THE BLAZING LOGS
8009-283568-0010 AND LISTENING TO THE SOLEMN TICKING OF THE HIGH DUTCH CLOCK AGAINST THE WALL THEN THERE STOLE IN AT THE DOOR A DELICIOUS ODOR OF DINNER COOKING DOWNSTAIRS AN ODOR SO PROMISING AS TO ROAST CHICKENS
8009-283568-0011 AND BAKED POTATOES AND GRAVY AND PIE AS TO MAKE ANY LITTLE BOY'S MOUTH WATER AND PRESENTLY DAVY BEGAN SOFTLY TELLING HIMSELF WHAT HE WOULD CHOOSE FOR HIS DINNER HE HAD QUITE FINISHED FANCYING THE FIRST PART OF HIS FEAST
8009-283568-0012 AND WAS JUST COMING IN HIS MIND TO AN EXTRA LARGE SLICE OF APPLE PIE WELL BROWNED STARING MEANWHILE VERY HARD AT ONE OF THE BRASS KNOBS OF THE ANDIRONS TO KEEP HIS THOUGHTS FROM WANDERING
8009-283568-0013 WHEN HE SUDDENLY DISCOVERED A LITTLE MAN PERCHED UPON THAT IDENTICAL KNOB AND SMILING AT HIM WITH ALL HIS MIGHT THIS LITTLE MAN WAS A VERY CURIOUS LOOKING PERSON INDEED
8009-283568-0014 HE WAS ONLY ABOUT A FOOT HIGH BUT HIS HEAD WAS AS BIG AS A COCOANUT AND HE HAD GREAT BULGING EYES LIKE A FROG AND A RIDICULOUS TURNED UP NOSE HIS LEGS WERE AS SLENDER AS SPINDLES AND HE HAD LONG POINTED TOES
8009-283568-0015 AND THERE WAS NO WAY OF KNOWING WHERE THE SMILE ENDED EXCEPT BY LOOKING AT IT FROM BEHIND WHICH DAVY COULDN'T DO AS YET WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE FIRE
8009-283568-0016 THE FACT IS HE WAS FRIGHTENED ALMOST OUT OF HIS WITS PARTICULARLY WHEN HE SAW THAT THE LITTLE MAN STILL SMILING FURIOUSLY
8009-283568-0017 AND AFTER CRACKING THEM LIKE NUTS WITH HIS TEETH EATING THEM WITH GREAT RELISH DAVY WATCHED THIS ALARMING MEAL EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO SEE THE LITTLE MAN BURST INTO A BLAZE AND DISAPPEAR BUT HE FINISHED HIS COALS IN SAFETY
8009-283568-0018 I KNOW YOU DO YOU SAID DAVY FAINTLY OH YES SAID THE LITTLE MAN
8009-283568-0019 YOU ARE THE LITTLE BOY WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE IN FAIRIES NOR IN GIANTS NOR IN GOBLINS
8009-283568-0020 NOW THE TRUTH WAS THAT DAVY HAVING NEVER MET ANY GIANTS WHEN HE WAS OUT WALKING NOR SEEN ANY FAIRIES PEEPING OUT OF THE BUSHES IN THE GARDEN
8009-283568-0021 WERE PURELY IMAGINARY BEINGS SO THAT NOW HE COULD DO NOTHING BUT STARE AT THE LITTLE MAN IN A SHAMEFACED SORT OF WAY AND WONDER WHAT WAS COMING NEXT NOW ALL THAT SAID THE LITTLE MAN
8009-283568-0022 SHAKING HIS FINGER AT HIM IN A REPROVING WAY ALL THAT IS VERY FOOLISH AND VERY WRONG I'M A GOBLIN MYSELF A HOBGOBLIN AND I'VE COME TO TAKE YOU
8009-283568-0023 IF YOU PLEASE I CAN'T GO CRIED DAVY IN GREAT ALARM AT THIS PROPOSAL
8009-283568-0024 RUBBISH
8009-283568-0025 THAT STOOD ON THE MANTEL SHELF HOLDING A CLOCK IN HIS ARMS THE CLOCK NEVER WENT BUT FOR THAT MATTER THE COLONEL NEVER WENT EITHER FOR HE HAD BEEN STANDING STOCK STILL
8009-283568-0026 FOR YEARS AND IT SEEMED PERFECTLY RIDICULOUS TO ASK HIM ANYTHING ABOUT GOING ANYWHERE SO DAVY FELT QUITE SAFE IN LOOKING UP AT HIM AND ASKING PERMISSION TO GO ON THE BELIEVING VOYAGE TO HIS DISMAY
8009-283568-0027 THE COLONEL NODDED HIS HEAD AND CRIED OUT IN A LITTLE CRACKED VOICE
8009-283568-0028 AT THIS THE GOBLIN JUMPED DOWN OFF THE KNOB OF THE ANDIRON AND SKIPPING BRISKLY ACROSS THE ROOM TO THE BIG DUTCH CLOCK RAPPED SHARPLY ON THE FRONT OF THE CASE WITH HIS KNUCKLES WHEN TO DAVY'S AMAZEMENT
8009-283568-0029 THE GREAT THING FELL OVER ON ITS FACE UPON THE FLOOR AS SOFTLY AS IF IT HAD BEEN A FEATHER BED
8009-283568-0030 BUT BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO MAKE ANY FURTHER DISCOVERIES
8009-283568-0031 SUDDENLY REAPPEARED CARRYING TWO LARGE SPONGE CAKES IN HIS ARMS NOW DAVY WAS PERFECTLY SURE THAT HE HAD SEEN HIS GRANDMOTHER PUTTING THOSE VERY SPONGE CAKES INTO THE OVEN TO BAKE
8009-283568-0032 THE GOBLIN CLAPPED ONE INTO EACH SEAT AND SCRAMBLING INTO THE CLOCK SAT DOWN UPON THE SMALLER ONE MERELY REMARKING
