4108-2777-0000 RIVERSIDE DRIVE SLEPT THE MOON SHONE ON DARKENED WINDOWS AND DESERTED SIDEWALKS IT WAS PAST ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE WICKED FORTIES WERE STILL ABLAZE WITH LIGHT AND NOISY FOXTROTS BUT IN THE VIRTUOUS HUNDREDS
4108-2777-0001 WHERE MISTER PETT'S HOUSE STOOD RESPECTABLE SLUMBER REIGNED ONLY THE OCCASIONAL DRONE OF A PASSING AUTOMOBILE BROKE THE SILENCE OR THE LOVE SICK CRY OF SOME FELINE ROMEO PATROLLING A WALL TOP JIMMY WAS AWAKE
4108-2777-0002 HE WAS SITTING ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED WATCHING HIS FATHER PUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO HIS MAKE UP WHICH WAS OF A SHAGGY AND INTIMIDATING NATURE THE ELDER CROCKER HAD CONCEIVED THE OUTWARD ASPECT OF CHICAGO ED KING OF THE KIDNAPPERS
4108-2777-0003 ON BROAD AND IMPRESSIVE LINES AND ONE GLANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO TELL THE SAGACIOUS OBSERVER THAT HERE WAS NO WHITE SOULED COMRADE FOR A NOCTURNAL SAUNTER DOWN LONELY LANES AND OUT OF THE WAY ALLEYS MISTER CROCKER SEEMED TO FEEL THIS HIMSELF
4108-2777-0004 THE ONLY TROUBLE IS JIM HE SAID PEERING AT HIMSELF IN THE GLASS SHAN'T I SCARE THE BOY TO DEATH DIRECTLY HE SEES ME
4108-2777-0005 HOW DO YOU SUGGEST SENDING HIM A FORMAL NOTE MISTER CROCKER SURVEYED HIS REPELLENT FEATURES DOUBTFULLY IT'S A GOOD DEAL TO SPRING ON A KID AT ONE IN THE MORNING HE SAID SUPPOSE HE HAS A FIT HE'S FAR MORE LIKELY TO GIVE YOU ONE
4108-2777-0006 DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT OGDEN DAD I SHOULDN'T THINK THERE WAS A CHILD ALIVE MORE EQUAL TO HANDLING SUCH A SITUATION THERE WAS AN EMPTY GLASS STANDING ON A TRAY ON THE DRESSING TABLE MISTER CROCKER EYED THIS SADLY I WISH YOU HADN'T THROWN THAT STUFF AWAY JIM
4108-2777-0007 I COULD HAVE DONE WITH IT I'M FEELING NERVOUS NONSENSE DAD YOU'RE ALL RIGHT I HAD TO THROW IT AWAY I'M ON THE WAGON NOW BUT HOW LONG I SHOULD HAVE STAYED ON WITH THAT SMILING UP AT ME I DON'T KNOW
4108-2777-0008 I'VE MADE UP MY MIND NEVER TO LOWER MYSELF TO THE LEVEL OF THE BEASTS THAT PERISH WITH THE DEMON RUM AGAIN BECAUSE MY FUTURE WIFE HAS STRONG VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT BUT THERE'S NO SENSE IN TAKING CHANCES TEMPTATION IS ALL VERY WELL BUT YOU DON'T NEED IT ON YOUR DRESSING TABLE
4108-2777-0009 IT WAS A KINDLY THOUGHT OF YOURS TO PLACE IT THERE DAD BUT EH I DIDN'T PUT IT THERE I THOUGHT THAT SORT OF THING CAME IN YOUR DEPARTMENT ISN'T IT THE BUTLER'S JOB TO SUPPLY DRINKS TO THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY WELL IT DOESN'T MATTER
4108-2777-0010 IT IS NOW DISTRIBUTED OVER THE NEIGHBOURING SOIL THUS REMOVING A POWERFUL TEMPTATION FROM YOUR PATH YOU'RE BETTER WITHOUT IT HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH WELL IT OUGHT TO BE ALL RIGHT NOW HE WENT TO THE WINDOW THERE'S AN AUTOMOBILE DOWN THERE I SUPPOSE IT'S JERRY
4108-2777-0011 I TOLD HIM TO BE OUTSIDE AT ONE SHARP AND IT'S NEARLY HALF PAST I THINK YOU MIGHT BE STARTING DAD OH BY THE WAY YOU HAD BETTER TELL OGDEN THAT YOU REPRESENT A GENTLEMAN OF THE NAME OF BUCK MAGINNIS IT WAS BUCK WHO GOT AWAY WITH HIM LAST TIME
4108-2777-0012 AND A FIRM FRIENDSHIP SEEMS TO HAVE SPRUNG UP BETWEEN THEM THERE'S NOTHING LIKE COMING WITH A GOOD INTRODUCTION MISTER CROCKER TOOK A FINAL SURVEY OF HIMSELF IN THE MIRROR GEE I I'D HATE TO MEET MYSELF ON A LONELY ROAD HE OPENED THE DOOR AND STOOD FOR A MOMENT LISTENING
4108-2777-0013 FROM SOMEWHERE DOWN THE PASSAGE CAME THE MURMUR OF A MUFFLED SNORE THIRD DOOR ON THE LEFT SAID JIMMY THREE COUNT EM THREE DON'T GO GETTING MIXED MISTER CROCKER SLID INTO THE OUTER DARKNESS LIKE A STOUT GHOST
4108-2777-0014 AND JIMMY CLOSED THE DOOR GENTLY BEHIND HIM HAVING LAUNCHED HIS INDULGENT PARENT SAFELY ON A CAREER OF CRIME JIMMY SWITCHED OFF THE LIGHT AND RETURNED TO THE WINDOW LEANING OUT HE GAVE HIMSELF UP FOR A MOMENT TO SENTIMENTAL MUSINGS
4108-2777-0015 THE NIGHT WAS VERY STILL THROUGH THE TREES WHICH FLANKED THE HOUSE THE DIMMED HEADLIGHTS OF WHAT WAS PRESUMABLY JERRY MITCHELL'S HIRED CAR SHONE FAINTLY LIKE ENLARGED FIRE FLIES A BOAT OF SOME DESCRIPTION WAS TOOTING REFLECTIVELY FAR DOWN THE RIVER
4108-2777-0016 AFTER HIS FATHER AND OGDEN HAD PASSED THROUGH AND HE PROPOSED TO REMAIN HID IN THE GALLERY THERE UNTIL THE TIME CAME FOR HIM TO DO THIS IT WAS IMPERATIVE THAT HE AVOID BEING SEEN BY OGDEN LOCKING HIS DOOR BEHIND HIM HE WENT DOWNSTAIRS
4108-2777-0017 THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF LIFE IN THE HOUSE EVERYTHING WAS STILL HE FOUND THE STAIRCASE LEADING TO THE GALLERY WITHOUT HAVING TO SWITCH ON THE LIGHTS IT WAS DUSTY IN THE GALLERY AND A SMELL OF OLD LEATHER ENVELOPED HIM HE HOPED HIS FATHER WOULD NOT BE LONG
4108-2777-0018 MISTER CROCKER MEANWHILE MASKED TO THE EYES HAD CREPT IN FEARFUL SILENCE TO THE DOOR WHICH JIMMY HAD INDICATED A GOOD DEAL OF THE GAY ENTHUSIASM WITH WHICH HE HAD EMBARKED ON THIS ENTERPRISE HAD EBBED AWAY FROM HIM
4108-2777-0019 NOW THAT HE HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE NOVELTY OF FINDING HIMSELF ONCE MORE PLAYING A CHARACTER PART HIS INTIMATE RESPECTABILITY BEGAN TO ASSERT ITSELF IT WAS ONE THING TO PLAY CHICAGO ED AT A BROADWAY THEATRE BUT QUITE ANOTHER TO GIVE A BENEFIT PERFORMANCE LIKE THIS
4108-2777-0020 AS HE TIP TOED ALONG THE PASSAGE THE ONE THING THAT PRESENTED ITSELF MOST CLEARLY TO HIM WAS THE APPALLING OUTCOME OF THIS ACT OF HIS SHOULD ANYTHING GO WRONG HE WOULD HAVE TURNED BACK BUT FOR THE THOUGHT THAT JIMMY WAS DEPENDING ON HIM
4108-2777-0021 AND THAT SUCCESS WOULD MEAN JIMMY'S HAPPINESS STIMULATED BY THIS REFLECTION HE OPENED OGDEN'S DOOR INCH BY INCH AND WENT IN HE STOLE SOFTLY ACROSS THE ROOM HE HAD ALMOST REACHED THE BED AND HAD JUST BEGUN TO WONDER HOW ON EARTH
4108-2777-0022 WHEN MISTER CROCKER HAD FINISHED BLINKING AND HAD ADJUSTED HIS EYES TO THE GLARE HE PERCEIVED OGDEN SITTING UP IN BED WITH A REVOLVER IN HIS HAND THE REVOLVER WAS RESTING ON HIS KNEE AND ITS MUZZLE POINTED DIRECTLY AT MISTER CROCKER'S AMPLE STOMACH
4108-2777-0023 EXHAUSTIVE AS HAD BEEN THE THOUGHT WHICH JIMMY'S FATHER HAD GIVEN TO THE POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENTS OF HIS ENTERPRISE THIS WAS A CONTINGENCY OF WHICH HE HAD NOT DREAMED HE WAS ENTIRELY AT A LOSS DON'T DO THAT HE SAID HUSKILY IT MIGHT GO OFF
4108-2777-0024 I SHOULD WORRY REPLIED OGDEN COLDLY I'M AT THE RIGHT END OF IT WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE HE LOOKED FONDLY AT THE LETHAL WEAPON I GOT THIS WITH CIGARETTE COUPONS TO SHOOT RABBITS WHEN WE WENT TO THE COUNTRY HERE'S WHERE I GET A CHANCE AT SOMETHING PART HUMAN

4108-2777-0026 AN IDEA STRUCK HIM SAY DID YOU COME TO KIDNAP ME MISTER CROCKER FELT THE SENSE OF RELIEF WHICH HE HAD SOMETIMES EXPERIENCED ON THE STAGE WHEN MEMORY HAD FAILED HIM DURING A SCENE AND A FELLOW ACTOR HAD THROWN HIM THE LINE
4108-2777-0027 IT WOULD BE EXAGGERATING TO SAY THAT HE WAS HIMSELF AGAIN HE COULD NEVER BE COMPLETELY AT HIS CASE WITH THAT PISTOL POINTING AT HIM BUT HE FELT CONSIDERABLY BETTER HE LOWERED HIS VOICE AN OCTAVE OR SO AND SPOKE IN A HUSKY GROWL AW CHEESE IT KID
