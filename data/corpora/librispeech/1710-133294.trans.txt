1710-133294-0000 HERE I MIGHT STOP BUT THE READER WOULD PERHAPS FEEL THAT I HAD NOT SATISFIED HIS EXPECTATIONS THE ABSOLUTE SUPREMACY OF DEMOCRACY IS NOT ALL THAT WE MEET WITH IN AMERICA THE INHABITANTS OF THE NEW WORLD MAY BE CONSIDERED FROM MORE THAN ONE POINT OF VIEW
1710-133294-0001 IN THE COURSE OF THIS WORK MY SUBJECT HAS OFTEN LED ME TO SPEAK OF THE INDIANS AND THE NEGROES
1710-133294-0002 I HAVE MENTIONED IN WHAT SPIRIT AND ACCORDING TO WHAT LAWS THE ANGLO AMERICAN UNION WAS FORMED BUT I COULD ONLY GLANCE AT THE DANGERS WHICH MENACE THAT CONFEDERATION
1710-133294-0003 WHILST IT WAS EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO GIVE A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF ITS CHANCES OF DURATION INDEPENDENTLY OF ITS LAWS AND MANNERS WHEN SPEAKING OF THE UNITED REPUBLICAN STATES I HAZARDED NO CONJECTURES UPON THE PERMANENCE OF REPUBLICAN FORMS IN THE NEW WORLD
1710-133294-0004 I WAS UNABLE TO INQUIRE INTO THE FUTURE CONDITION OF THE AMERICANS AS A COMMERCIAL PEOPLE THESE TOPICS ARE COLLATERALLY CONNECTED WITH MY SUBJECT WITHOUT FORMING A PART OF IT THEY ARE AMERICAN WITHOUT BEING DEMOCRATIC AND TO PORTRAY DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN MY PRINCIPAL AIM
1710-133294-0005 THE TERRITORY NOW OCCUPIED OR CLAIMED BY THE AMERICAN UNION SPREADS FROM THE SHORES OF THE ATLANTIC TO THOSE OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN ON THE EAST AND WEST ITS LIMITS ARE THOSE OF THE CONTINENT ITSELF
1710-133294-0006 ON THE SOUTH IT ADVANCES NEARLY TO THE TROPIC AND IT EXTENDS UPWARDS TO THE ICY REGIONS OF THE NORTH THE HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE SCATTERED OVER THIS SPACE DO NOT FORM AS IN EUROPE SO MANY BRANCHES OF THE SAME STOCK THREE RACES NATURALLY DISTINCT
1710-133294-0007 ALMOST INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIERS HAD BEEN RAISED BETWEEN THEM BY EDUCATION AND BY LAW AS WELL AS BY THEIR ORIGIN AND OUTWARD CHARACTERISTICS BUT FORTUNE HAS BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER ON THE SAME SOIL WHERE ALTHOUGH THEY ARE MIXED THEY DO NOT AMALGAMATE
1710-133294-0008 AND EACH RACE FULFILS ITS DESTINY APART
1710-133294-0009 IS THE WHITE OR EUROPEAN THE MAN PRE EMINENT AND IN SUBORDINATE GRADES THE NEGRO AND THE INDIAN THESE TWO UNHAPPY RACES HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON
1710-133294-0010 NEITHER BIRTH NOR FEATURES NOR LANGUAGE NOR HABITS THEIR ONLY RESEMBLANCE LIES IN THEIR MISFORTUNES BOTH OF THEM OCCUPY AN INFERIOR RANK IN THE COUNTRY THEY INHABIT BOTH SUFFER FROM TYRANNY
1710-133294-0011 IF WE REASONED FROM WHAT PASSES IN THE WORLD WE SHOULD ALMOST SAY THAT THE EUROPEAN IS TO THE OTHER RACES OF MANKIND WHAT MAN IS TO THE LOWER ANIMALS HE MAKES THEM SUBSERVIENT TO HIS USE AND WHEN HE CANNOT SUBDUE HE DESTROYS THEM
1710-133294-0012 THE LANGUAGE WHICH HIS FOREFATHERS SPOKE IS NEVER HEARD AROUND HIM HE ABJURED THEIR RELIGION AND FORGOT THEIR CUSTOMS WHEN HE CEASED TO BELONG TO AFRICA WITHOUT ACQUIRING ANY CLAIM TO EUROPEAN PRIVILEGES BUT HE REMAINS HALF WAY BETWEEN THE TWO COMMUNITIES SOLD BY THE ONE REPULSED BY THE OTHER
1710-133294-0013 EXCEPT THE FAINT IMAGE OF A HOME WHICH THE SHELTER OF HIS MASTER'S ROOF AFFORDS THE NEGRO HAS NO FAMILY WOMAN IS MERELY THE TEMPORARY COMPANION OF HIS PLEASURES
1710-133294-0014 AM I TO CALL IT A PROOF OF GOD'S MERCY OR A VISITATION OF HIS WRATH THAT MAN IN CERTAIN STATES APPEARS TO BE INSENSIBLE TO HIS EXTREME WRETCHEDNESS AND ALMOST AFFECTS WITH A DEPRAVED TASTE THE CAUSE OF HIS MISFORTUNES
1710-133294-0015 THE NEGRO WHO IS PLUNGED IN THIS ABYSS OF EVILS SCARCELY FEELS HIS OWN CALAMITOUS SITUATION VIOLENCE MADE HIM A SLAVE
1710-133294-0016 AND FINDS HIS JOY AND HIS PRIDE IN THE SERVILE IMITATION OF THOSE WHO OPPRESS HIM
1710-133294-0017 THE NEGRO ENTERS UPON SLAVERY AS SOON AS HE IS BORN
1710-133294-0018 AND HAVE BEGUN HIS SLAVERY BEFORE HE BEGAN HIS EXISTENCE
1710-133294-0019 WHO HAS AN INTEREST IN PRESERVING HIS LIFE AND THAT THE CARE OF IT DOES NOT DEVOLVE UPON HIMSELF
1710-133294-0020 IF HE BECOMES FREE INDEPENDENCE IS OFTEN FELT BY HIM TO BE A HEAVIER BURDEN THAN SLAVERY FOR HAVING LEARNED IN THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE TO SUBMIT TO EVERYTHING EXCEPT REASON HE IS TOO MUCH UNACQUAINTED WITH HER DICTATES TO OBEY THEM
1710-133294-0021 AND HE IS DESTITUTE OF THE KNOWLEDGE AND ENERGY NECESSARY TO RESIST THEM THESE ARE MASTERS WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO CONTEND WITH AND HE HAS LEARNT ONLY TO SUBMIT AND OBEY
1710-133294-0022 IN SHORT HE SINKS TO SUCH A DEPTH OF WRETCHEDNESS THAT WHILE SERVITUDE BRUTALIZES LIBERTY DESTROYS HIM OPPRESSION HAS BEEN NO LESS FATAL TO THE INDIAN THAN TO THE NEGRO RACE BUT ITS EFFECTS ARE DIFFERENT
1710-133294-0023 ENDURING THE VICISSITUDES AND PRACTISING THE VIRTUES AND VICES COMMON TO SAVAGE NATIONS THE EUROPEANS HAVING DISPERSED THE INDIAN TRIBES AND DRIVEN THEM INTO THE DESERTS CONDEMNED THEM TO A WANDERING LIFE FULL OF INEXPRESSIBLE SUFFERINGS
1710-133294-0024 SAVAGE NATIONS ARE ONLY CONTROLLED BY OPINION AND BY CUSTOM WHEN THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS HAD LOST THE SENTIMENT OF ATTACHMENT TO THEIR COUNTRY WHEN THEIR FAMILIES WERE DISPERSED THEIR TRADITIONS OBSCURED AND THE CHAIN OF THEIR RECOLLECTIONS BROKEN
1710-133294-0025 WHEN ALL THEIR HABITS WERE CHANGED AND THEIR WANTS INCREASED BEYOND MEASURE
1710-133294-0026 THE MORAL AND PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THESE TRIBES CONTINUALLY GREW WORSE AND THEY BECAME MORE BARBAROUS AS THEY BECAME MORE WRETCHED NEVERTHELESS THE EUROPEANS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO METAMORPHOSE THE CHARACTER OF THE INDIANS
1710-133294-0027 THE LOT OF THE NEGRO IS PLACED ON THE EXTREME LIMIT OF SERVITUDE
1710-133294-0028 AND SLAVERY DOES NOT PRODUCE MORE FATAL EFFECTS UPON THE FIRST THAN INDEPENDENCE UPON THE SECOND THE NEGRO HAS LOST ALL PROPERTY IN HIS OWN PERSON AND HE CANNOT DISPOSE OF HIS EXISTENCE WITHOUT COMMITTING A SORT OF FRAUD
1710-133294-0029 HE HAS NEVER BENT HIS WILL TO THAT OF ANY OF HIS KIND
1710-133294-0030 AND THE VERY NAME OF LAW IS UNKNOWN TO HIM TO BE FREE WITH HIM SIGNIFIES TO ESCAPE FROM ALL THE SHACKLES OF SOCIETY
1710-133294-0031 CIVILIZATION HAS LITTLE POWER OVER HIM
1710-133294-0032 HE CONFORMS TO THE TASTES OF HIS OPPRESSORS ADOPTS THEIR OPINIONS AND HOPES BY IMITATING THEM TO FORM A PART OF THEIR COMMUNITY HAVING BEEN TOLD FROM INFANCY THAT HIS RACE IS NATURALLY INFERIOR TO THAT OF THE WHITES HE ASSENTS TO THE PROPOSITION AND IS ASHAMED OF HIS OWN NATURE
1710-133294-0033 IN EACH OF HIS FEATURES HE DISCOVERS A TRACE OF SLAVERY AND IF IT WERE IN HIS POWER HE WOULD WILLINGLY RID HIMSELF OF EVERYTHING THAT MAKES HIM WHAT HE IS THE INDIAN ON THE CONTRARY HAS HIS IMAGINATION INFLATED WITH THE PRETENDED NOBILITY OF HIS ORIGIN
1710-133294-0034 AND LIVES AND DIES IN THE MIDST OF THESE DREAMS OF PRIDE FAR FROM DESIRING TO CONFORM HIS HABITS TO OURS HE LOVES HIS SAVAGE LIFE AS THE DISTINGUISHING MARK OF HIS RACE AND HE REPELS EVERY ADVANCE TO CIVILIZATION LESS PERHAPS FROM THE HATRED WHICH HE ENTERTAINS FOR IT
1710-133294-0035 I ARRIVED ONE DAY AT THE LOG HOUSE OF A PIONEER I DID NOT WISH TO PENETRATE INTO THE DWELLING OF THE AMERICAN BUT RETIRED TO REST MYSELF FOR A WHILE ON THE MARGIN OF A SPRING WHICH WAS NOT FAR OFF IN THE WOODS
1710-133294-0036 WHICH WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CREEK TERRITORY AN INDIAN WOMAN APPEARED FOLLOWED BY A NEGRESS AND HOLDING BY THE HAND A LITTLE WHITE GIRL OF FIVE OR SIX YEARS OLD WHOM I TOOK TO BE THE DAUGHTER OF THE PIONEER A SORT OF BARBAROUS LUXURY SET OFF THE COSTUME OF THE INDIAN
1710-133294-0037 RINGS OF METAL WERE HANGING FROM HER NOSTRILS AND EARS
1710-133294-0038 THE NEGRESS WAS CLAD IN SQUALID EUROPEAN GARMENTS THEY ALL THREE CAME AND SEATED THEMSELVES UPON THE BANKS OF THE FOUNTAIN
1710-133294-0039 LAVISHED UPON HER SUCH FOND CARESSES AS MOTHERS GIVE WHILE THE NEGRESS ENDEAVORED BY VARIOUS LITTLE ARTIFICES TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG CREOLE THE CHILD DISPLAYED IN HER SLIGHTEST GESTURES A CONSCIOUSNESS OF SUPERIORITY
1710-133294-0040 WHICH FORMED A STRANGE CONTRAST WITH HER INFANTINE WEAKNESS
1710-133294-0041 THE NEGRESS WAS SEATED ON THE GROUND BEFORE HER MISTRESS WATCHING HER SMALLEST DESIRES
1710-133294-0042 WHILST THE SAVAGE DISPLAYED IN THE MIDST OF HER TENDERNESS AN AIR OF FREEDOM AND OF PRIDE WHICH WAS ALMOST FEROCIOUS
1710-133294-0043 I HAD PERCEIVED FROM MANY DIFFERENT RESULTS THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE WHITES BUT IN THE PICTURE WHICH I HAVE JUST BEEN DESCRIBING THERE WAS SOMETHING PECULIARLY TOUCHING A BOND OF AFFECTION HERE UNITED THE OPPRESSORS WITH THE OPPRESSED
1710-133294-0044 AND THE EFFORT OF NATURE TO BRING THEM TOGETHER RENDERED STILL MORE STRIKING THE IMMENSE DISTANCE PLACED BETWEEN THEM BY PREJUDICE AND BY LAW THE PRESENT AND PROBABLE FUTURE CONDITION OF THE INDIAN TRIBES WHICH INHABIT THE TERRITORY POSSESSED BY THE UNION
1710-133294-0045 GRADUAL DISAPPEARANCE OF THE NATIVE TRIBES MANNER IN WHICH IT TAKES PLACE MISERIES ACCOMPANYING THE FORCED MIGRATIONS OF THE INDIANS THE SAVAGES OF NORTH AMERICA HAD ONLY TWO WAYS OF ESCAPING DESTRUCTION WAR OR CIVILIZATION
1710-133294-0046 THEY ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO MAKE WAR
1710-133294-0047 AND WHY THEY CANNOT BECOME SO NOW THAT THEY DESIRE IT INSTANCE OF THE CREEKS AND CHEROKEES POLICY OF THE PARTICULAR STATES TOWARDS THESE INDIANS
1710-133294-0048 NONE OF THE INDIAN TRIBES WHICH FORMERLY INHABITED THE TERRITORY OF NEW ENGLAND THE NARAGANSETTS
1710-133294-0049 HAVE ANY EXISTENCE BUT IN THE RECOLLECTION OF MAN
1710-133294-0050 THIS IS DONE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AS THE TERRITORY OF A HUNTING NATION IS ILL DEFINED IT IS THE COMMON PROPERTY OF THE TRIBE AND BELONGS TO NO ONE IN PARTICULAR
1710-133294-0051 A FEW EUROPEAN FAMILIES SETTLED IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER SOON DRIVE AWAY THE WILD ANIMALS WHICH REMAIN BETWEEN THEIR PLACES OF ABODE
1710-133294-0052 THEN FIND IT DIFFICULT TO SUBSIST AND STILL MORE DIFFICULT TO PROCURE THE ARTICLES OF BARTER WHICH THEY STAND IN NEED OF TO DRIVE AWAY THEIR GAME IS TO DEPRIVE THEM OF THE MEANS OF EXISTENCE
1710-133294-0053 AS EFFECTUALLY AS IF THE FIELDS OF OUR AGRICULTURISTS WERE STRICKEN WITH BARRENNESS AND THEY ARE REDUCED LIKE FAMISHED WOLVES TO PROWL THROUGH THE FORSAKEN WOODS IN QUEST OF PREY
1710-133294-0054 AND ARE GUIDED BY THESE WILD ANIMALS IN THE CHOICE OF THEIR FUTURE COUNTRY
