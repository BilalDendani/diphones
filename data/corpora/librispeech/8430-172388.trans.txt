8430-172388-0022 AND IT MIGHT AS WELL BE NOW AS ANY TIME SHE CARRIED THE TRAY BLINDLY INTO THE KITCHEN TILLIE WHO WAS ALWAYS LISTENING AND LOOKING OUT FOR HER TOOK THE DISHES FROM HER WITH A FURTIVE FRIGHTENED GLANCE AT HER STONY FACE
8430-172388-0023 THEA WENT SLOWLY UP THE BACK STAIRS TO HER LOFT HER LEGS SEEMED AS HEAVY AS LEAD AS SHE CLIMBED THE STAIRS AND SHE FELT AS IF EVERYTHING INSIDE HER HAD SOLIDIFIED AND GROWN HARD
8430-172388-0024 AFTER SHUTTING HER DOOR AND LOCKING IT SHE SAT DOWN ON THE EDGE OF HER BED THIS PLACE HAD ALWAYS BEEN HER REFUGE BUT THERE WAS A HOSTILITY IN THE HOUSE NOW WHICH THIS DOOR COULD NOT SHUT OUT
8430-172388-0025 THIS WOULD BE HER LAST SUMMER IN THAT ROOM ITS SERVICES WERE OVER ITS TIME WAS DONE SHE ROSE AND PUT HER HAND ON THE LOW CEILING TWO TEARS RAN DOWN HER CHEEKS
8430-172388-0026 AS IF THEY CAME FROM ICE THAT MELTED SLOWLY SHE WAS NOT READY TO LEAVE HER LITTLE SHELL SHE WAS BEING PULLED OUT TOO SOON SHE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO THINK ANYWHERE ELSE AS WELL AS HERE SHE WOULD NEVER SLEEP SO WELL
8430-172388-0027 OR HAVE SUCH DREAMS IN ANY OTHER BED EVEN LAST NIGHT SUCH SWEET BREATHLESS DREAMS THEA HID HER FACE IN THE PILLOW WHEREVER SHE WENT SHE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THAT LITTLE BED WITH HER
8430-172388-0028 WHEN SHE WENT AWAY FROM IT FOR GOOD SHE WOULD LEAVE SOMETHING THAT SHE COULD NEVER RECOVER MEMORIES OF PLEASANT EXCITEMENT OF HAPPY ADVENTURES IN HER MIND OF WARM SLEEP ON HOWLING WINTER NIGHTS
8430-172388-0029 AND JOYOUS AWAKENINGS ON SUMMER MORNINGS THERE WERE CERTAIN DREAMS THAT MIGHT REFUSE TO COME TO HER AT ALL EXCEPT IN A LITTLE MORNING CAVE FACING THE SUN WHERE THEY CAME TO HER SO POWERFULLY
8430-172388-0030 WHERE THEY BEAT A TRIUMPH IN HER THE ROOM WAS HOT AS AN OVEN THE SUN WAS BEATING FIERCELY ON THE SHINGLES BEHIND THE BOARD CEILING SHE UNDRESSED AND BEFORE SHE THREW HERSELF UPON HER BED IN HER CHEMISE
8430-172388-0031 SHE FROWNED AT HERSELF FOR A LONG WHILE IN HER LOOKING GLASS YES SHE AND IT MUST FIGHT IT OUT TOGETHER THE THING THAT LOOKED AT HER OUT OF HER OWN EYES WAS THE ONLY FRIEND SHE COULD COUNT ON
8430-172388-0032 OH SHE WOULD MAKE THESE PEOPLE SORRY ENOUGH THERE WOULD COME A TIME WHEN THEY WOULD WANT TO MAKE IT UP WITH HER BUT NEVER AGAIN SHE HAD NO LITTLE VANITIES
8430-172388-0033 HER MOTHER WAS ALL RIGHT
8430-172388-0034 IN THE NATURE OF THINGS HER MOTHER HAD TO BE ON BOTH SIDES THEA FELT THAT SHE HAD BEEN BETRAYED A TRUCE HAD BEEN BROKEN BEHIND HER BACK SHE HAD NEVER HAD MUCH INDIVIDUAL AFFECTION FOR ANY OF HER BROTHERS EXCEPT THOR
8430-172388-0035 BUT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN DISLOYAL NEVER FELT SCORN OR HELD GRUDGES AS A LITTLE GIRL SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN GOOD FRIENDS WITH GUNNER AND AXEL WHENEVER SHE HAD TIME TO PLAY EVEN BEFORE SHE GOT HER OWN ROOM
8430-172388-0036 WHEN THEY WERE ALL SLEEPING AND DRESSING TOGETHER LIKE LITTLE CUBS AND BREAKFASTING IN THE KITCHEN SHE HAD LED AN ABSORBING PERSONAL LIFE OF HER OWN BUT SHE HAD A CUB LOYALTY TO THE OTHER CUBS
8430-172388-0037 SHE THOUGHT THEM NICE BOYS AND TRIED TO MAKE THEM GET THEIR LESSONS SHE ONCE FOUGHT A BULLY WHO PICKED ON AXEL AT SCHOOL SHE NEVER MADE FUN OF ANNA'S CRIMPINGS AND CURLINGS AND BEAUTY RITES
8430-172388-0038 THEA HAD ALWAYS TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED THAT HER SISTER AND BROTHERS RECOGNIZED THAT SHE HAD SPECIAL ABILITIES AND THAT THEY WERE PROUD OF IT SHE HAD DONE THEM THE HONOR SHE TOLD HERSELF BITTERLY
8430-172388-0039 TO BELIEVE THAT THOUGH THEY HAD NO PARTICULAR ENDOWMENTS THEY WERE OF HER KIND AND NOT OF THE MOONSTONE KIND NOW THEY HAD ALL GROWN UP AND BECOME PERSONS
8430-172388-0040 THEIR AMBITIONS AND SACRED PROPRIETIES WERE MEANINGLESS TO HER SHE HAD NEGLECTED TO CONGRATULATE CHARLEY UPON HAVING BEEN PROMOTED FROM THE GROCERY DEPARTMENT OF COMMINGS'S STORE TO THE DRYGOODS DEPARTMENT
8430-172388-0041 HER MOTHER HAD REPROVED HER FOR THIS OMISSION AND HOW WAS SHE TO KNOW THEA ASKED HERSELF THAT ANNA EXPECTED TO BE TEASED BECAUSE BERT RICE NOW CAME AND SAT IN THE HAMMOCK WITH HER EVERY NIGHT
8430-172388-0042 NO IT WAS ALL CLEAR ENOUGH NOTHING THAT SHE WOULD EVER DO IN THE WORLD WOULD SEEM IMPORTANT TO THEM AND NOTHING THEY WOULD EVER DO WOULD SEEM IMPORTANT TO HER THEA LAY THINKING INTENTLY ALL THROUGH THE STIFLING AFTERNOON
8430-172388-0043 TILLIE WHISPERED SOMETHING OUTSIDE HER DOOR ONCE BUT SHE DID NOT ANSWER SHE LAY ON HER BED UNTIL THE SECOND CHURCH BELL RANG AND SHE SAW THE FAMILY GO TROOPING UP THE SIDEWALK ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET
8430-172388-0044 ANNA AND HER FATHER IN THE LEAD ANNA SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN ON A VERY STORY BOOK ATTITUDE TOWARD HER FATHER PATRONIZING AND CONDESCENDING IT SEEMED TO THEA THE OLDER BOYS WERE NOT IN THE FAMILY BAND
8430-172388-0045 TILLIE HAD STAYED AT HOME TO GET SUPPER THEA GOT UP WASHED HER HOT FACE AND ARMS AND PUT ON THE WHITE ORGANDIE DRESS SHE HAD WORN LAST NIGHT IT WAS GETTING TOO SMALL FOR HER AND SHE MIGHT AS WELL WEAR IT OUT
8430-172388-0046 AFTER SHE WAS DRESSED SHE UNLOCKED HER DOOR AND WENT CAUTIOUSLY DOWNSTAIRS SHE FELT AS IF CHILLING HOSTILITIES MIGHT BE AWAITING HER IN THE TRUNK LOFT ON THE STAIRWAY ALMOST ANYWHERE
