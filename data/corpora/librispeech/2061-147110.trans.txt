2061-147110-0000 IT WAS THE ONE SENTINEL BESIDE THE GATEWAY TO NEW FRANCE THEREFORE IT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN BEFORE QUEBEC AND CANADA WERE ATTACKED IT WAS THE ONE CORSAIR LYING IN PERPETUAL WAIT BESIDE THE BRITISH LINES OF SEABORNE TRADE
2061-147110-0001 THEREFORE IT MUST BE TAKEN BEFORE BRITISH SHIPPING COULD BE SAFE IT WAS THE ONE FRENCH SEA LINK BETWEEN THE OLD WORLD AND THE NEW THEREFORE ITS BREAKING WAS OF SUPREME IMPORTANCE IT WAS THE ONE REAL FORTRESS EVER HEARD OF IN AMERICA
2061-147110-0002 AND IT WAS IN ABSOLUTELY ALIEN HANDS THEREFORE SO RAN NEW ENGLAND LOGIC IT WAS MOST OFFENSIVE TO ALL TRUE BRITONS NEW ENGLANDERS AND PURITANS TO ALL RIVALS IN SMUGGLING TRADE AND PRIVATEERING AND TO ALL RIGHT THINKING PEOPLE GENERALLY
2061-147110-0003 IN SEVENTEEN FORTY FOUR WHEN FREDERICK THE GREAT HAD BEGUN THE WAR OF THE AUSTRIAN SUCCESSION AND FRANCE HAD TAKEN ARMS AGAINST GREAT BRITAIN DU QUESNEL THE GOVERNOR OF LOUISBOURG WHO HAD RECEIVED THE INTELLIGENCE OF THESE EVENTS SOME WEEKS BEFORE THE ALERT BOSTONIANS
2061-147110-0004 AT ONCE DECIDED TO WIN CREDIT BY STRIKING THE FIRST BLOW HE WAS MUCH DISLIKED IN LOUISBOURG HE DRANK HARD CURSED HIS SUBORDINATES WHEN IN HIS CUPS AND SET THE WHOLE PLACE BY THE EARS
2061-147110-0005 MOREOVER MANY OF THOSE UNDER HIM WISHED TO AVOID GIVING THE BRITISH AMERICANS ANY PROVOCATION IN THE HOPE THAT THE WAR MIGHT BE CONFINED TO EUROPE BUT NONE DARED TO REFUSE A LEGAL AND POSITIVE ORDER SO IN MAY HIS EXPEDITION LEFT FOR CANSO
2061-147110-0006 WHO SENT THEM ON TO BOSTON AFTER BURNING THEIR FORT TO THE GROUND ELATED BY THIS SOMEWHAT ABSURD SUCCESS AND STRENGTHENED BY NEARLY A HUNDRED REGULARS AND FOUR HUNDRED INDIANS WHO RAISED HIS TOTAL FORCE TO AT LEAST A THOUSAND MEN
2061-147110-0007 THE BRITISH RECEIVED A SLIGHT REINFORCEMENT THE FRENCH DID NOT AND IN SEPTEMBER DU VIVIER SUDDENLY RETIRED WITHOUT ATTEMPTING AN ASSAULT THE BURNING OF CANSO AND THE ATTACK ON ANNAPOLIS STIRRED UP THE WRATH OF NEW ENGLAND A WILD ENTHUSIAST
2061-147110-0008 WILLIAM VAUGHAN URGED GOVERNOR SHIRLEY OF MASSACHUSETTS TO MAKE AN IMMEDIATE COUNTER ATTACK SHIRLEY WAS AN ENGLISH LAWYER GOOD AT HIS OWN WORK BUT VERY ANXIOUS TO BECOME FAMOUS AS A CONQUEROR HE LENT A WILLING EAR TO VAUGHAN
2061-147110-0009 AND ASTOUNDED THE GENERAL COURT OF MASSACHUSETTS ON JANUARY TWENTY FIRST SEVENTEEN FORTY FIVE BY FIRST INDUCING THE MEMBERS TO SWEAR SECRECY AND THEN ASKING THEM TO CONSIDER A PLAN FOR A COLONIAL EXPEDITION AGAINST LOUISBOURG
2061-147110-0010 HE AND THEY WERE ON VERY GOOD TERMS BUT THEY WERE PROVINCIAL CAUTIOUS AND NATURALLY SLOW WHEN IT CAME TO PLANNING CAMPAIGNS AND PLEDGING THEIR CREDIT FOR WHAT WAS THEN AN ENORMOUS SUM OF MONEY NOR COULD THEY BE BLAMED
2061-147110-0011 NONE OF THEM KNEW MUCH ABOUT ARMIES AND NAVIES MOST THOUGHT LOUISBOURG WAS A REAL TRANSATLANTIC DUNKIRK AND ALL KNEW THAT THEY WERE QUITE INSOLVENT ALREADY
2061-147110-0012 REPORTED AGAINST THE SCHEME WHEREUPON EACH HOUSE CARRIED A SECRET ADVERSE VOTE BY A LARGE MAJORITY BUT JUST BEFORE THESE VOTES WERE TAKEN A PURITAN MEMBER FROM A COUNTRY DISTRICT
2061-147110-0013 WRESTLED IN WHAT HE THOUGHT CONFIDENTIAL PRAYER WITH SUCH LOUD EJACULATIONS THAT AN EAVESDROPPER OVERHEARD HIM AND PASSED THE SECRET ON OF COURSE THE MOMENTOUS NEWS AT ONCE BEGAN TO RUN LIKE WILDFIRE THROUGH THE PROVINCE STILL THE NOES HAD IT BOTH IN THE COUNTRY AND THE HOUSE
2061-147110-0014 SHIRLEY WAS DEJECTED AND IN DOUBT WHAT TO DO NEXT BUT JAMES GIBSON THE MERCHANT MILITIAMAN SUDDENLY HIT ON THE IDEA OF GETTING UP A PETITION AMONG THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THE RESULT SURPASSED EVERY EXPECTATION ALL THE MERCHANTS WERE EAGER FOR ATTACK
2061-147110-0015 THE WHOLE SUBJECT WAS AGAIN DEBATED PROVINCIAL INSOLVENCY AND THE ABSENCE OF EITHER A FLEET OR AN ARMY WERE URGED BY THE OPPOSITION BUT THE FIGHTING PARTY PUT FORTH ALL THEIR STRENGTH AND PLEADED THAT DELAY MEANT REINFORCEMENTS FOR LOUISBOURG AND A GOOD CHANCE LOST FOR EVER
2061-147110-0016 THE VOTE WOULD HAVE BEEN A TIE IF A MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITION HAD NOT SLIPPED AND BROKEN HIS LEG AS HE WAS HURRYING DOWN TO THE HOUSE ONCE THE DECISION HAD BEEN REACHED HOWEVER ALL DID THEIR BEST TO ENSURE SUCCESS SHIRLEY WROTE TO HIS BROTHER GOVERNORS
2061-147110-0017 VAUGHAN GALLOPED OFF POST HASTE TO NEW HAMPSHIRE WITH THE FIRST OFFICIAL LETTER GIBSON LED THE MERCHANTS IN LOCAL MILITARY ZEAL THE RESULT WAS THAT MASSACHUSETTS WHICH THEN INCLUDED MAINE RAISED OVER THREE THOUSAND MEN WHILE NEW HAMPSHIRE AND CONNECTICUT
2061-147110-0018 RAISED ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED EACH RHODE ISLAND CONCURRED BUT UNGRACIOUSLY AND INEFFECTUALLY LATE SHE NURSED TWO GRUDGES AGAINST MASSACHUSETTS ONE ABOUT THE UNDENIABLY HARSH TREATMENT METED OUT TO HER GREAT FOUNDER ROGER WILLIAMS
2061-147110-0019 THERE WAS NO MILITARY LEADER IN THE WHOLE OF NEW ENGLAND SO THE NEXT MOST SUITABLE MAN WAS THE CIVILIAN WHO BEST COMBINED THE NECESSARY QUALITIES OF GOOD SENSE SOUND KNOWLEDGE OF MEN AND AFFAIRS FIRMNESS DIPLOMACY AND POPULARITY POPULARITY WAS ESSENTIAL
2061-147110-0020 SINCE NONE OF THEM RECOGNIZED ANY COMMON AUTHORITY EXCEPT THAT OF THE CROWN HE WAS ABLY SECONDED BY MANY LEADING MEN WHO IF NOT TRAINED SOLDIERS WERE AT LEAST ACCUSTOMED TO THE ORGANIZATION OF PUBLIC LIFE
2061-147110-0021 WHICH WERE AFTERWARDS REDEEMED BY THE IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT AT A TOTAL COST OF NEARLY A QUARTER OF A MILLION STERLING THERE WAS NO TIME AND THERE WERE NO MEANS TO CHANGE THE MILITIA INTO AN ARMY BUT MANY COMPENSATING ADVANTAGES HELPED TO MAKE UP FOR ITS DEFICIENCIES
2061-147110-0022 THE MEN VOLUNTEERED EAGERLY THEY WERE ALL VERY KEEN TO FIGHT THE FRENCH MOST OF THEM UNDERSTOOD THE INDIVIDUAL USE OF FIREARMS MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN TO SEA AND HAD LEARNED TO WORK TOGETHER AS A CREW
2061-147110-0023 NEARLY ALL OF THEM HAD THE HANDINESS THEN REQUIRED FOR LIFE IN A NEW COUNTRY AND WHAT WITH CONVICTION AND WHAT WITH PREJUDICE THEY WERE ALSO QUITE DISPOSED TO LOOK UPON THE EXPEDITION AS A SORT OF CRUSADE AGAINST IDOLATROUS PAPISTS
2061-147110-0024 AND THEREFORE AS A VERY PROPER CLIMAX TO THE GREAT AWAKENING WHICH HAD RECENTLY ROUSED NEW ENGLAND TO THE HEIGHTS OF RELIGIOUS ZEALOTRY UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE FAMOUS GEORGE WHITEFIELD HIMSELF
2061-147110-0025 WHITEFIELD WARNED PEPPERRELL THAT HE WOULD BE ENVIED IF HE SUCCEEDED AND ABUSED IF HE FAILED THE REVEREND THOMAS PRINCE OPENLY REGRETTED THE CHANGE OF ENEMY THE HEAVENLY SHOWER IS OVER FROM FIGHTING THE DEVIL THEY NEEDS MUST TURN TO FIGHTING THE FRENCH
2061-147110-0026 BUT PARSON MOODY MOST TRUCULENT OF PURITANS HAD NO DOUBTS WHATEVER THE FRENCH THE POPE AND THE DEVIL WERE ALL ONE TO HIM AND WHEN HE EMBARKED AS SENIOR CHAPLAIN HE TOOK A HATCHET WITH WHICH TO BREAK DOWN THE GRAVEN IMAGES OF LOUISBOURG
2061-147110-0027 IN THE END WHITEFIELD WARMED UP ENOUGH TO GIVE THE EXPEDITION ITS OFFICIAL MOTTO NIL DESPERANDUM CHRISTO DUCE THE NEVER DESPAIR HEARTENED THE WORLDLINGS
2061-147110-0028 BUT HAVING NO ORDERS FROM ENGLAND HE AT FIRST FELT OBLIGED TO REFUSE WITHIN A SHORT TIME HOWEVER HE WAS GIVEN A FREE HAND BY THE IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT WHICH AUTHORIZED HIM TO CONCERT MEASURES WITH SHIRLEY
2061-147110-0029 WARREN IMMEDIATELY SAILED FOR CANSO WITH THREE MEN OF WAR AND SENT FOR ANOTHER TO JOIN HIM HIS WAIT FOR ORDERS MADE HIM NEARLY THREE WEEKS LATER THAN THE NEW ENGLANDERS IN ARRIVING AT THE RENDEZVOUS BUT THIS DELAY DUE TO NO FAULT OF HIS OWN
2061-147110-0030 THE THIRTEEN PROVINCIAL ARMED VESSELS CARRIED MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND MEN NO EXACT RETURNS WERE EVER MADE OUT FOR THE TRANSPORTS BUT AS SIXTY EIGHT LAY AT ANCHOR IN CANSO HARBOUR WHILE OTHERS CAME DROPPING IN FROM DAY TO DAY
2061-147110-0031 IN ADDITION TO ALL THE STORES AND AS THE FRENCH COUNTED NINETY SIX TRANSPORTS MAKING FOR GABARUS BAY
2061-147110-0032 WHILE THE CREWS COULD HARDLY HAVE MUSTERED LESS THAN AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY MEN EACH THE GRAND TOTAL AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EXPEDITION COULD NOT THEREFORE HAVE BEEN LESS THAN EIGHT THOUSAND MEN OF ALL SORTS PUT TOGETHER OVER FOUR THOUSAND AMERICAN PROVINCIAL MILITIA
2061-147110-0033 OVER ONE THOUSAND MEN OF THE ROYAL NAVY QUITE ONE THOUSAND MEN ABOARD THE PROVINCIAL FIGHTING VESSELS AND AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND MORE AS CREWS TO WORK THE TRANSPORTS MAY FIRST THE FIRST SUNDAY THE PROVINCIALS SPENT AT CANSO
2061-147110-0034 A CONSCIENTIOUS DIARIST THOUGH FULL OF SABBATARIAN ZEAL WAS FAIN TO ADMIT THAT SEVERALL SORTS OF BUSNESSES WAS A GOING ON SUM A EXERCISING SUM A HEARING O THE PREACHING ON MAY FIFTH WARREN SAILED INTO CANSO
2061-147110-0035 THE PROVINCIALS THOUGHT THE DATE OF HIS ARRIVAL A VERY HAPPY OMEN AS IT FELL ON WHAT WAS THEN ACCORDING TO THE OLD STYLE CALENDAR SAINT GEORGE'S DAY APRIL TWENTY THIRD AFTER A CONFERENCE WITH PEPPERRELL HE HURRIED OFF TO BEGIN THE BLOCKADE OF LOUISBOURG
2061-147110-0036 A WEEK LATER MAY TWENTY FIRST THE TRANSPORTS JOINED HIM THERE AND LANDED THEIR MILITIAMEN FOR ONE OF THE MOST ECCENTRIC SIEGES EVER KNOWN WHILE THE BRITISH HAD BEEN SPENDING THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF SEVENTEEN FORTY FIVE IN PREPARING EIGHT THOUSAND MEN
2061-147110-0037 THE NEWS FROM BOSTON WAS NOT HEEDED WORSE YET NO ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THE AMERICAN SCOUTING VESSELS WHICH HAD BEEN HOVERING OFF THE COAST FOR MORE THAN A MONTH THE BIBULOUS DU QUESNEL HAD DIED IN OCTOBER BUT HIS SUCCESSOR DU CHAMBON
2061-147110-0038 WITHOUT A SIEGE AND LEFT ONE SLEEPY SENTRY TO WATCH WOLFE'S COVE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE BATTLE OF THE PLAINS IT IS TRUE THAT DU CHAMBON HAD SUCCEEDED TO A THOROUGHLY BAD COMMAND
2061-147110-0039 AND THE MILITARY FORCE HAD BECOME WORSE INSTEAD OF BETTER
2061-147110-0040 THEY KNEW THAT ACQUISITIVE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE CHEATING THEM OUT OF THEIR PROPER RATIONS OF BACON AND BEANS THE OFFICIALS KNEW THAT THE SOLDIERS KNEW AND SO SUSPICION AND RESENTMENT GREW STRONG BETWEEN THEM
2061-147110-0041 THE ONLY OTHER FORCE WAS THE MILITIA WHICH WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS COMPRISED EVERY MALE INHABITANT OF CAPE BRETON WHO COULD STAND ON TWO LEGS AND HOLD A MUSKET WITH BOTH HANDS THERE WERE BOYS IN THEIR EARLY TEENS AND OLD MEN IN THEIR SIXTIES
2061-147110-0042 NEARLY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE BUT FOUR OR FIVE HUNDRED THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN NEVER RECEIVED THEIR MARCHING ORDERS SO THE TOTAL COMBATANTS ONLY AMOUNTED TO SOME ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED
2061-147110-0043 THE NON COMBATANTS NUMBERED NEARLY AS MANY THE CRAMPED HUNDRED ACRES OF IMPRISONED LOUISBOURG THUS CONTAINED ALMOST FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE MUTINEERS AND MILITIA WOMEN AND CHILDREN DRONES AND OTHER OFFICIALS ALL HUDDLED UP TOGETHER
2061-147110-0044 NO REINFORCEMENTS ARRIVED AFTER THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE BRITISH FLEET MARIN A WELL KNOWN GUERILLA LEADER HAD BEEN SENT DOWN FROM QUEBEC THROUGH THE BUSH WITH SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED WHITES AND INDIANS
2061-147110-0045 AND THIS TIME A GENERAL ATTACK ON ACADIA BUT THESE OTHER TWO THOUSAND WERE NEVER SENT AND MARIN HAVING FAILED TO TAKE ANNAPOLIS BY THE FIRST WEEK IN JUNE WAS TOO LATE AND TOO WEAK TO HELP LOUISBOURG AFTERWARDS THE SAME ILL LUCK PURSUED THE FRENCH BY SEA
2061-147110-0046 WAS NOT MANAGED ACCORDING TO SHIRLEY'S WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS NOR WAS THE SIEGE SHIRLEY HAD BEEN PLAYING A LITTLE WAR GAME IN HIS STUDY WITH ALL THE INCONVENIENT OBSTACLES LEFT OUT
2061-147110-0047 THE ROCKS AND BOGS OF THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY THE DIFFICULTIES OF ENTERING A NARROW NECKED HARBOUR UNDER A COMBINATION OF END ON AND BROADSIDE FIRE THE TERRIBLE LEE SHORE OFF THE ISLANDS REEFS AND LIGHTHOUSE POINT
2061-147110-0048 THE COMMONEST VIGILANCE OF THE MOST SLOVENLY GARRISON AND EVEN THE OFFENSIVE POWER OF THE GUNS ON THE WALLS OF LOUISBOURG ITSELF SHIRLEY'S PLAN WAS THAT PEPPERRELL SHOULD ARRIVE IN THE OFFING TOO LATE TO BE SEEN LAND UNOBSERVED
2061-147110-0049 AND MARCH ON LOUISBOURG IN FOUR DETACHMENTS WHILE THE GARRISON WAS WRAPPED IN SLUMBER TWO OF THESE DETACHMENTS WERE TO MARCH WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE AND THEN HALT AND KEEP A PROFOUND SILENCE THE THIRD WAS TO MARCH UNDER COVER OF SAID HILLS
2061-147110-0050 A LARGE OPEN ROADSTEAD RUNNING WEST FROM THE LITTLE LOUISBOURG PENINSULA THE PROVINCIALS EYED THE FORTRESS EAGERLY IT LOOKED MEAN SQUAT AND SHRUNKEN IN THE DIM GREY LIGHT OF EARLY DAWN BUT IT LOOKED HARD ENOUGH FOR ALL THAT ITS ALARM BELLS BEGAN TO RING
2061-147110-0051 ITS SIGNAL CANNON FIRED AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN LIVING OUTSIDE HURRIED IN BEHIND THE WALLS THE NEW ENGLANDERS WERE SO KEEN TO LAND THAT THEY RAN SOME DANGER OF FALLING INTO COMPLETE DISORDER BUT PEPPERRELL MANAGED VERY CLEVERLY
2061-147110-0052 HAVING COMPLETELY OUTDISTANCED THE HANDFUL OF PANTING FRENCHMEN HE LANDED IN PERFECT SAFETY AND PRESENTLY SCATTERED THEM WITH A WILD CHARGE WHICH COST THEM ABOUT TWENTY IN KILLED WOUNDED AND PRISONERS BEFORE DARK TWO THOUSAND PROVINCIALS WERE ASHORE
2061-147110-0053 THE OTHER TWO THOUSAND LANDED AT THEIR LEISURE THE FOLLOWING DAY THE NEXT EVENT IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY SIEGE IS ONE OF THE CURIOSITIES OF WAR
2061-147110-0054 ON MAY FOURTEENTH THE ENTHUSIASTIC VAUGHAN TOOK SEVERAL HUNDREDS OF THESE NEWLY LANDED MEN TO THE TOP OF THE NEAREST HILLOCK AND SALUTED THE WALLS WITH THREE CHEERS HE THEN CIRCLED THE WHOLE HARBOUR KEEPING WELL INLAND
2061-147110-0055 TILL HE REACHED THE UNDEFENDED STOREHOUSES ON THE INNER SIDE OF THE NORTH EAST HARBOUR A LITTLE BEYOND THE ROYAL BATTERY THESE HE AT ONCE SET ON FIRE THE PITCH TAR WOOD AND OTHER COMBUSTIBLES MADE A BLINDING SMOKE
2061-147110-0056 SUSPECTING A RUSE HE BRIBED AN INDIAN WITH A FLASK OF BRANDY TO FEIGN BEING DRUNK AND REEL UP TO THE WALLS THE INDIAN REACHED THE FORT UNCHALLENGED CLIMBED INTO AN EMBRASURE AND FOUND THE WHOLE PLACE DESERTED
2061-147110-0057 VAUGHAN FOLLOWED AT ONCE AND A YOUNG VOLUNTEER SHINNING UP THE FLAG POLE MADE HIS OWN RED COAT FAST TO THE TOP THIS DEFIANCE WAS IMMEDIATELY ANSWERED BY A RANDOM SALVO FROM LOUISBOURG LESS THAN A MILE ACROSS THE HARBOUR
2061-147110-0058 VAUGHAN'S NEXT MOVE WAS TO WRITE A DISPATCH TO PEPPERRELL MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HONOUR TO BE INFORMED THAT BY THE GRACE OF GOD AND THE COURAGE OF THIRTEEN MEN I ENTERED THE ROYAL BATTERY ABOUT NINE O THE CLOCK AND AM WAITING FOR A REINFORCEMENT AND A FLAG
2061-147110-0059 AND KEPT THEM ALL AT BAY TILL THE REINFORCEMENT AND THE FLAG ARRIVED WITH BRADSTREET WHO WAS AFTERWARDS TO WIN DISTINCTION AS THE CAPTOR OF FORT FRONTENAC DURING THE GREAT CAMPAIGN OF SEVENTEEN FIFTY NINE
2061-147110-0060 BECAUSE EVERYTHING SEEMED TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THE FRENCH AND IN FAVOUR OF THE BRITISH EVEN THE ELEMENTS AS THE ANONYMOUS HABITANT DE LOUISBOURG COMPLAINS IN HIS WONDERFULLY CANDID DIARY SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN SIDES
2061-147110-0061 THERE HAD NEVER BEEN SO FINE A SPRING FOR NAVAL OPERATIONS BUT THIS WAS THE ONE THING WHICH WAS ENTIRELY INDEPENDENT OF FRENCH FAULT OR BRITISH MERIT ALL THE OTHER STROKES OF LUCK OWED SOMETHING TO HUMAN CAUSES
2061-147110-0062 WISE ACRES HAD SHAKEN THEIR HEADS OVER THE CRAZY IDEA OF TAKING BRITISH CANNON BALLS SOLELY TO FIT FRENCH CANNON THAT WERE TO BE TAKEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SIEGE IT WAS TOO MUCH LIKE SELLING THE PELT BEFORE THE TRAP WAS SPRUNG
2061-147110-0063 MOREOVER AS IF TO CAP THE CLIMAX
2061-147110-0064 AND AGAIN SPARE BRITISH BALLS WERE FOUND TO FIT EXACTLY THE FACT IS THAT WHAT WE SHOULD NOW CALL THE INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT HAD BEEN DOING GOOD WORK THE YEAR BEFORE BY SPYING OUT THE LAND AT LOUISBOURG AND REPORTING TO THE PROPER MEN IN BOSTON
2061-147110-0065 THE BOSTONIANS HAD ALWAYS INTENDED TO TAKE THE ROYAL BATTERY AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT BUT NOBODY HAD THOUGHT THAT THE FRENCH WOULD ABANDON IT WITHOUT A BLOW AND LEAVE IT INTACT FOR THEIR ENEMY WITH ALL ITS ARMAMENT COMPLETE
2061-147110-0066 TO BURN THE CARRIAGES OR KNOCK THE TRUNNIONS OFF THE INVALUABLE STORES WERE LEFT IN THEIR PLACES THE ONLY REAL DESTRUCTION WAS CAUSED BY A BARREL OF POWDER WHICH SOME BUNGLERS BLEW UP BY MISTAKE
2061-147110-0067 WAS THAT THE ROYAL BATTERY ROARED AGAINST LOUISBOURG THE VERY NEXT MORNING WITH TREMENDOUS EFFECT SMASHING THE WORKS MOST EXPOSED TO ITS FIRE BRINGING DOWN HOUSES ABOUT THE INHABITANTS EARS AND SENDING THE TERRIFIED NON COMBATANTS SCURRYING OFF TO UNDERGROUND COVER
2061-147110-0068 MEANWHILE THE BULK OF THE NEW ENGLANDERS WERE ESTABLISHING THEIR CAMP ALONG THE BROOK WHICH FELL INTO GABARUS BAY BESIDE FLAT POINT AND WITHIN TWO MILES OF LOUISBOURG EQUIPMENT OF ALL KINDS WAS VERY SCARCE
2061-147110-0069 TENTS WERE SO FEW AND BAD THAT OLD SAILS STRETCHED OVER RIDGE POLES HAD TO BE USED INSTEAD WHEN SAILS RAN SHORT BRUSHWOOD SHELTERS ROOFED IN WITH OVERLAPPING SPRUCE BOUGHS WERE USED AS SUBSTITUTES
2061-147110-0070 THERE WAS AT FIRST MORE RISK OF FOUNDERING ASHORE THAN AFLOAT THERE WERE NEITHER ROADS NOR YET THE MEANS TO MAKE THEM THERE WERE NO HORSES OXEN MULES OR ANY OTHER MEANS OF TRANSPORT EXCEPT THE BRAWNY MEN THEMSELVES
2061-147110-0071 WHO LITERALLY BUCKLED TO WITH ANCHOR CABLE DRAG ROPES A HUNDRED PAIR OF STRAINING MEN FOR EACH GREAT LUMBERING GUN OVER THE SAND THEY WENT AT A ROMP OVER THE ROCKS THEY HAD TO TAKE CARE AND IN THE DENSE OBSTRUCTING SCRUB
2061-147110-0072 THEY HAD TO HAUL THROUGH BY MAIN FORCE BUT THIS WAS CHILD'S PLAY TO WHAT AWAITED THEM IN THE SLIMY SHIFTING AND BOULDER STREWN BOG THEY HAD TO PASS BEFORE REACHING THE HILLOCKS WHICH COMMANDED LOUISBOURG THE FIRST ATTEMPTS HERE WERE DISASTROUS
2061-147110-0073 THE GUNS SANK OUT OF SIGHT IN THE ENGULFING BOG WHILE THE TOILING MEN BECAME REGULAR HUMAN TARGETS FOR SHOT AND SHELL FROM LOUISBOURG
2061-147110-0074 MESERVE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE CAME TO THE RESCUE BY DESIGNING A GUN SLEIGH SIXTEEN FEET IN LENGTH AND FIVE IN THE BEAM THEN THE CREWS WERE TOLD OFF AGAIN
2061-147110-0075 TWO HUNDRED MEN FOR EACH SLEIGH AND ORDERS WERE GIVEN THAT THE WORK SHOULD NOT BE DONE EXCEPT AT NIGHT OR UNDER COVER OF THE FREQUENT FOGS AFTER THIS THINGS WENT MUCH BETTER THAN BEFORE BUT THE LABOUR WAS TREMENDOUS STILL
2061-147110-0076 WHILE THE DANGER FROM RANDOM SHELLS BURSTING AMONG THE BOULDERS WAS NOT TO BE DESPISED FOUR HUNDRED STRUGGLING FEET FOUR HUNDRED STRAINING ARMS EACH TEAM HOVE ON ITS LONG TAUT CABLE THROUGH FOG RAIN AND THE BLACKNESS OF THE NIGHT
2061-147110-0077 SO WHEN THE LAST TWO HUNDRED MEN HAD WALLOWED THROUGH THE WHOLE ENSNARING BOG WAS SEAMED WITH A PERFECT MAZE OF DECOYING DEATH TRAILS SNAKING IN AND OUT OF THE FORBIDDING SCRUB AND BOULDERS
2061-147110-0078 PEPPERRELL'S DISPATCHES COULD NOT EXAGGERATE THESE ALMOST INCREDIBLE HARDSHIPS AFLOAT AND ASHORE AWAKE AND ASLEEP THE MEN WERE SOAKING WET FOR DAYS TOGETHER AT THE END OF THE LONGEST HAUL THEY HAD NOTHING BUT A CHOICE OF EVILS
2061-147110-0079 THEY COULD EITHER LIE DOWN WHERE THEY WERE ON HARD ROCK OR OOZING BOG EXPOSED TO THE ENEMY'S FIRE THE MOMENT IT WAS LIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE THE BRITISH BATTERIES OR THEY COULD PLOUGH THEIR WAY BACK TO CAMP HERE THEY WERE SAFE ENOUGH FROM SHOT AND SHELL
2061-147110-0080 BUT IN OTHER RESPECTS NO BETTER OFF THAN IN THE BATTERIES MOST MEN'S KITS WERE OF THE VERY SCANTIEST VERY FEW HAD EVEN A SINGLE CHANGE OF CLOTHING A GOOD MANY WENT BARE FOOT NEARLY ALL WERE IN RAGS BEFORE THE SIEGE WAS OVER
2061-147110-0081 IN THIS MOST EXTRAORDINARY SIEGE IT TOOK AT LEAST A HORSE'S WEIGHT AS WELL THE APPROACH TO THE WALLS DEFIED ALL THE USUAL PRECAUTIONS OF REGULAR WAR BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES JUSTIFIED ITS BOLDNESS WITH ONLY FOUR THOUSAND MEN AT THE START
2061-147110-0082 WITH NEARLY HALF OF THIS TOTAL ON THE SICK LIST AT ONE RATHER CRITICAL JUNCTURE WITH VERY FEW TRAINED GUNNERS AND WITHOUT ANY CORPS OF ENGINEERS AT ALL THE PROVINCIALS ADAPTED THEMSELVES TO THE SITUATION SO DEFIANTLY THAT THEY PUZZLED SHOOK AND OVERAWED THE FRENCH
2061-147110-0083 WHO THOUGHT THEM TWO OR THREE TIMES STRONGER THAN THEY REALLY WERE RECKLESSLY DEFIANT THOUGH THEY WERE HOWEVER THEY DID PROVIDE THE BREACHING BATTERIES WITH ENOUGH COVER FOR THE PURPOSE IN HAND THIS IS AMPLY PROVED BOTH BY THE FEWNESS OF THEIR CASUALTIES
2061-147110-0084 THE BRITISH ENGINEER AT ANNAPOLIS
2061-147110-0085 AND REPORTED THEM SUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED WHERE THE PROVINCIALS SHOWED THEIR PRENTICE HANDS TO GENUINE DISADVANTAGE WAS IN THEIR ABSURDLY SOLEMN AND UTTERLY FUTILE COUNCILS OF WAR
2061-147110-0086 NO SCHOOLBOYS DEBATING CLUB COULD WELL HAVE DONE WORSE THAN THE COUNCIL HELD TO CONSIDER DU CHAMBON'S STEREOTYPED ANSWER TO THE USUAL SUMMONS SENT IN AT THE BEGINNING OF A SIEGE THE FORMULA THAT HIS CANNON WOULD ANSWER FOR HIM
2061-147110-0087 PROVOKED A TREMENDOUS STORM IN THE COUNCIL'S TEACUP AND IMMEDIATELY RESULTED IN THE FOLLOWING RESOLUTION ADVISED UNANIMOUSLY THAT THE TOWNE OF LOUISBOURG BE ATTACKED THIS NIGHT
2061-147110-0088 BUT CONFRONTED WITH A GREAT DISSATYSFACTION IN MANY OF THE OFFICERS AND SOULDIERS AT THE DESIGNED ATTACK OF THE TOWNE THIS NIGHT IT WAS ADVISED UNANIMOUSLY BY A SECOND COUNCIL CALLED IN GREAT HASTE
2061-147110-0089 THAT THE SAID ATTACK BE DEFERRED FOR THE PRESENT THIS PRESENT LASTED DURING THE REST OF THE SIEGE ONCE THE NEW ENGLANDERS HAD SETTLED DOWN HOWEVER THEY WISELY BEGAN TO INCREASE THEIR WEIGHT OF METAL AS WELL AS TO DECREASE THE RANGE AT WHICH THEY USED IT
2061-147110-0090 THEY SET TO WORK WITH A WILL TO MAKE A BREACH AT THE NORTH WEST GATE OF LOUISBOURG NEAR WHERE THE INNER ANGLE OF THE WALLS ABUTTED ON THE HARBOUR AND THEY CERTAINLY NEEDED ALL THEIR INDOMITABLE PERSEVERANCE WHEN IT CAME TO ARMING THEIR NEW NORTH WESTERN OR TITCOMB'S BATTERY
2061-147110-0091 THE TWENTY TWO POUNDERS HAD REQUIRED TWO HUNDRED MEN APIECE THE FORTY TWO POUNDERS TOOK THREE HUNDRED TWO OF THESE UNWIELDY GUNS WERE HAULED A COUPLE OF MILES ROUND THE HARBOUR IN THE DARK
2061-147110-0092 FROM THAT ROYAL BATTERY WHICH VAUGHAN HAD TAKEN BY THE GRACE OF GOD AND THE COURAGE OF THIRTEEN MEN AND THEN SUCCESSFULLY MOUNTED AT TITCOMB'S JUST WHERE THEY COULD DO THE GREATEST DAMAGE TO THEIR FORMER OWNERS THE FRENCH WELL TRAINED GUNNERS WERE EXCEEDINGLY SCARCE
2061-147110-0093 PEPPERRELL COULD FIND ONLY SIX AMONG HIS FOUR THOUSAND MEN BUT WARREN LENT HIM THREE MORE WHOM HE COULD ILL SPARE AS NO ONE KNEW WHEN A FLEET MIGHT COME OUT FROM FRANCE WITH THESE NINE INSTRUCTORS TO DIRECT THEM
2061-147110-0094 PEPPERRELL'S MEN CLOSED IN THEIR LINE OF FIRE TILL BESIEGED AND BESIEGERS CAME WITHIN SUCH EASY MUSKET SHOT OF ONE ANOTHER THAT TAUNTING CHALLENGES AND INVITATIONS COULD BE FLUNG ACROSS THE INTERVENING SPACE
2061-147110-0095 EACH SIDE CLAIMED ADVANTAGES AND EXPLAINED SHORTCOMINGS TO ITS OWN SATISFACTION A NEW ENGLAND DIARIST SAYS WE BEGAN OUR FIRE WITH AS MUCH FURY AS POSSIBLE AND THE FRENCH RETURNED IT AS WARMLY WITH CANNON MORTARS AND CONTINUAL SHOWERS OF MUSKET BALLS
2061-147110-0096 BUT BY ELEVEN O'CLOCK WE HAD BEAT THEM ALL FROM THEIR GUNS A FRENCH DIARIST OF THE SAME DAY SAYS THAT THE FIRE FROM THE WALLS WAS STOPPED ON PURPOSE CHIEFLY TO SAVE POWDER WHILE THE SAME REASON IS ASSIGNED FOR THE BRITISH ORDER TO CEASE FIRE EXACTLY ONE HOUR LATER
2061-147110-0097 THE PRACTICE CONTINUED TO BE EXCEEDINGLY BAD ON BOTH SIDES SO BAD INDEED THAT THE NEW ENGLANDERS SUFFERED MORE FROM THE BURSTING OF THEIR OWN GUNS THAN FROM THE ENEMY'S FIRE THE NINE INSTRUCTORS COULD NOT BE EVERYWHERE
2061-147110-0098 AND ALL THEIR GOOD ADVICE COULD NOT PREVENT THE EAGER AMATEURS FROM GROSSLY OVERLOADING THE DOUBLE SHOTTED PIECES ANOTHER FORTY TWO POUND GUN BURST AT THE GRAND BATTERY CAPTAIN HALE IS DANGEROUSLY HURT BY THE BURSTING OF ANOTHER GUN
2061-147110-0099 A MISFORTUNE DUE TO THE SAME CAUSE BUT IN SPITE OF ALL SUCH DRAWBACKS ON THE BRITISH SIDE LOUISBOURG GOT MUCH THE WORST OF IT THE FRENCH HAD TO FIRE FROM THE CENTRE OUTWARDS AT A SEMICIRCLE OF BATTERIES THAT FIRED BACK CONVERGINGLY AT THEM
2061-147110-0100 MANY HOUSES WERE LAID IN RUINS ONLY ONE REMAINED INTACT WHEN THE SIEGE WAS OVER THE NON COMBATANTS WHO NOW EXCEEDED THE GARRISON EFFECTIVES WERE HALF BURIED IN THE SMOTHERING CASEMATES UNDERGROUND AND THOUGH THE FIGHTING MEN HAD LIGHT AIR AND FOOD ENOUGH
2061-147110-0101 AND THOUGH THEY WERE LOSING VERY FEW IN KILLED AND WOUNDED THEY TOO BEGAN TO FEEL THAT LOUISBOURG MUST FALL IF IT WAS NOT SOON RELIEVED FROM OUTSIDE THE BRITISH ON THE CONTRARY GREW MORE AND MORE CONFIDENT BOTH AFLOAT AND ASHORE
2061-147110-0102 THOUGH THEY HAD ONE QUITE ALARMING SCARE ASHORE THEY KNEW THEIR NAVY OUTMATCHED THE FRENCH AND THEY SAW THAT WHILE WARREN WAS BEING STRENGTHENED DU CHAMBON WAS BEING LEFT AS DEVOID OF NAVAL FORCE AS EVER
2061-147110-0103 BUT THEIR STILL GREATER CONFIDENCE ASHORE WAS FOR THE TIME BEING VERY RUDELY SHAKEN WHEN THEY HEARD THAT MARIN THE SAME FRENCH GUERILLA LEADER WHO HAD BEEN SENT DOWN FROM QUEBEC AGAINST ANNAPOLIS WITH SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED WHITES AND INDIANS
2061-147110-0104 DISCIPLINE NEVER GOOD HAD BEEN GROWING WORSE PUNISHMENTS WERE UNKNOWN OFFICERS AND MEN WERE PETITIONING FOR LEAVE TO GO HOME QUITE REGARDLESS OF THE NEED FOR THEIR SERVICES AT THE FRONT DEMANDS FOR PROMOTION FOR EXTRA ALLOWANCES
2061-147110-0105 AND FOR INCREASED PAY WERE BECOMING A STANDING NUISANCE THEN JUST AS THE LEADERS WERE AT THEIR WITS ENDS WHAT TO DO MARIN'S THREATENED ATTACK CAME TO THEIR AID AND THEIR BRAVE ARMED MOB ONCE MORE BEGAN TO WEAR THE SEMBLANCE OF AN ARMY
2061-147110-0106 SENTRIES PIQUETS AND OUTPOSTS APPEARED AS IF BY MAGIC OFFICERS WENT THEIR ROUNDS WITH ZEAL THE CAMP SUDDENLY CEASED TO BE A DISORDERLY PLAYGROUND FOR EVERY ONE OFF DUTY THE BREACHING BATTERIES REDOUBLED THEIR EFFORTS AGAINST THE WALLS
2061-147110-0107 THE THREAT OF DANGER ONCE PAST HOWEVER THE MEN SOON SLIPPED BACK INTO THEIR CARELESS WAYS A NEW ENGLAND CHRONICLER RECORDS THAT THOSE WHO WERE ON THE SPOT HAVE FREQUENTLY IN MY HEARING LAUGHED AT THE RECITAL OF THEIR OWN IRREGULARITIES AND EXPRESSED THEIR ADMIRATION
2061-147110-0108 EVEN A MASSACHUSETTS PURITAN COULD RECOMMEND A SERMON FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION IN THE CAMP BECAUSE IT WILL PLEASE YOUR WHOLE ARMY AS IT SHOWS THEM THE WAY TO GAIN BY THEIR GALLANTRY THE HEARTS AND AFFECTIONS OF THE LADYS AND EVEN A CITY OF THE GREAT AWAKENING LIKE BOSTON
2061-147110-0109 COULD PRODUCE A LETTER LIKE THE FOLLOWING I HOPE THIS WILL FIND YOU AT LOUISBOURG WITH A BOWL OF PUNCH A PIPE AND A PACK OF CARDS AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU DESIRE I HAD FORGOT TO MENTION A PRETTY FRENCH MADAMMOSELLE YOUR FRIEND LUKE HAS LOST SEVERAL BEAVER HATTS ALREADY CONCERNING THE EXPEDITION
2061-147110-0110 DAMN HIS BLOOD SAYS LUKE LET HIM BE AN ENGLISHMAN OR A FRENCHMAN AND NOT PRETEND TO BE AN ENGLISHMAN WHEN HE IS A FRENCHMAN IN HIS HEART IF DRINKING TO YOUR SUCCESS WOULD TAKE CAPE BRITTON YOU MUST BE IN POSSESSION OF IT NOW FOR IT'S A STANDING TOAST
2061-147110-0111 THE DAY THIS LETTER WAS WRITTEN IN BOSTON MAY SIXTH WARREN HAD ALREADY BEGUN THE REGULAR BLOCKADE ONLY A SINGLE SHIP ELUDED HIM AN ABLY HANDLED BASQUE
2061-147110-0112 BUT WARREN'S BOAT CREWS TOOK HER SOME MEN WHO ESCAPED FROM HER BROUGHT DU CHAMBON THE NEWS THAT A THIRD FRENCH SHIP THE VIGILANT WAS COMING TO THE RELIEF OF LOUISBOURG WITH AMMUNITION AND OTHER STORES
