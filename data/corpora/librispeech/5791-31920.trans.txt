5791-31920-0000 WHATEVER COURAGE BRIGITTE HAD SHOWN SHE HAD DRUNK TO THE DREGS THE BITTER CUP OF HER SAD LOVE UNLESS I WISHED TO SEE HER DIE I MUST GIVE HER REPOSE
5791-31920-0001 SHE HAD OFTEN ADDRESSED CRUEL REPROACHES TO ME AND HAD PERHAPS ON CERTAIN OTHER OCCASIONS SHOWN MORE ANGER THAN IN THIS SCENE BUT WHAT SHE HAD SAID THIS TIME WAS NOT DICTATED BY OFFENDED PRIDE IT WAS THE TRUTH WHICH HIDDEN CLOSELY IN HER HEART
5791-31920-0002 THIS SLUMBER EVEN THIS DEATHLIKE SLEEP OF ONE WHO COULD SUFFER NO MORE WAS CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THIS SUDDEN SILENCE THE TENDERNESS SHE HAD SHOWN IN THE FINAL MOMENTS THAT PALE FACE AND THAT KISS CONFIRMED ME IN THE BELIEF THAT ALL WAS OVER
5791-31920-0003 UNWILLING TO CALL ANY ONE I LIGHTED BRIGITTE'S LAMP I WATCHED ITS FEEBLE FLAME AND MY THOUGHTS SEEMED TO FLICKER IN THE DARKNESS LIKE ITS UNCERTAIN RAYS WHATEVER I HAD SAID OR DONE THE IDEA OF LOSING BRIGITTE HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO ME UP TO THIS TIME
5791-31920-0004 I EXPERIENCED A DULL LANGUOR AND COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING CLEARLY WHAT MY MIND UNDERSTOOD MY SOUL RECOILED FROM ACCEPTING COME I SAID TO MYSELF I HAVE DESIRED IT AND I HAVE DONE IT THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST HOPE THAT WE CAN LIVE TOGETHER
5791-31920-0005 I AM UNWILLING TO KILL THIS WOMAN SO I HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO LEAVE HER IT IS ALL OVER I SHALL GO AWAY TO MORROW AND ALL THE WHILE I WAS THINKING NEITHER OF MY RESPONSIBILITY NOR OF THE PAST NOR FUTURE
5791-31920-0006 I THOUGHT NEITHER OF SMITH NOR HIS CONNECTION WITH THE AFFAIR I COULD NOT SAY WHO HAD LED ME THERE OR WHAT I HAD DONE DURING THE LAST HOUR
5791-31920-0007 I REMAINED FOR A LONG TIME IN THIS STRANGE CALM JUST AS THE MAN WHO RECEIVES A THRUST FROM A POIGNARD FEELS AT FIRST ONLY THE COLD STEEL WHEN HE HAS GONE SOME DISTANCE ON HIS WAY HE BECOMES WEAK HIS EYES START FROM THEIR SOCKETS AND HE ASKS WHAT HAS HAPPENED
5791-31920-0008 BUT DROP BY DROP THE BLOOD FLOWS THE GROUND UNDER HIS FEET BECOMES RED DEATH COMES THE MAN AT HIS APPROACH SHUDDERS WITH HORROR AND FALLS AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A THUNDERBOLT THUS APPARENTLY CALM I AWAITED THE COMING OF MISFORTUNE
5791-31920-0009 I REPEATED IN A LOW VOICE WHAT BRIGITTE HAD SAID AND I PLACED NEAR HER ALL THAT I SUPPOSED SHE WOULD NEED FOR THE NIGHT I LOOKED AT HER AND THEN WENT TO THE WINDOW AND PRESSED MY FOREHEAD AGAINST THE PANE PEERING OUT AT A SOMBER AND LOWERING SKY THEN I RETURNED TO THE BEDSIDE
5791-31920-0010 I TREMBLED AT THESE WORDS AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ANOTHER WHO HAD PRONOUNCED THEM THEY RESOUNDED THROUGH ALL MY BEING AS RESOUNDS THE STRING OF THE HARP THAT HAS BEEN PLUCKED TO THE POINT OF BREAKING IN AN INSTANT TWO YEARS OF SUFFERING TRAVERSED MY HEART AND AFTER THEM
5791-31920-0011 AS THEIR CONSEQUENCE AND AS THEIR LAST EXPRESSION THE PRESENT SEIZED ME HOW SHALL I DESCRIBE SUCH WOE BY A SINGLE WORD PERHAPS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED I HAD TAKEN BRIGITTE'S HAND AND IN A DREAM DOUBTLESS SHE HAD PRONOUNCED MY NAME
5791-31920-0012 I AROSE AND WENT TO MY ROOM A TORRENT OF TEARS FLOWED FROM MY EYES I HELD OUT MY ARMS AS THOUGH TO SEIZE THE PAST WHICH WAS ESCAPING ME IS IT POSSIBLE I REPEATED THAT I AM GOING TO LOSE YOU I CAN LOVE NO ONE BUT YOU WHAT
5791-31920-0013 YOU ARE GOING AWAY AND FOREVER WHAT YOU MY LIFE MY ADORED MISTRESS YOU FLEE FROM ME I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN NEVER NEVER I SAID ALOUD AND ADDRESSING MYSELF TO THE SLEEPING BRIGITTE AS THOUGH SHE COULD HEAR ME I ADDED
5791-31920-0014 AND WHY SO MUCH PRIDE ARE THERE NO MEANS OF ATONING FOR THE OFFENSE I HAVE COMMITTED I BEG OF YOU LET US SEEK SOME EXPIATION HAVE YOU NOT PARDONED ME A THOUSAND TIMES BUT YOU LOVE ME YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GO FOR COURAGE WILL FAIL YOU WHAT SHALL WE DO
5791-31920-0015 A HORRIBLE MADNESS SEIZED ME I BEGAN TO RUN HERE AND THERE IN SEARCH OF SOME INSTRUMENT OF DEATH AT LAST I FELL ON MY KNEES AND BEAT MY HEAD AGAINST THE BED BRIGITTE STIRRED AND I REMAINED QUIET FEARING I WOULD WAKEN HER
5791-31920-0016 LET HER SLEEP UNTIL TO MORROW I SAID TO MYSELF YOU HAVE ALL NIGHT TO WATCH HER I RESUMED MY PLACE I WAS SO FRIGHTENED AT THE IDEA OF WAKING BRIGITTE THAT I SCARCELY DARED BREATHE
5791-31920-0017 GRADUALLY I BECAME MORE CALM AND LESS BITTER TEARS BEGAN TO COURSE GENTLY DOWN MY CHEEKS TENDERNESS SUCCEEDED FURY I LEANED OVER BRIGITTE AND LOOKED AT HER AS THOUGH FOR THE LAST TIME MY GOOD ANGEL WAS URGING ME TO GRAVE ON MY SOUL THE LINES OF THAT DEAR FACE
5791-31920-0018 HOW PALE SHE WAS HER LARGE EYES SURROUNDED BY A BLUISH CIRCLE WERE MOIST WITH TEARS HER FORM ONCE SO LITHE WAS BENT AS THOUGH UNDER A BURDEN HER CHEEK WASTED AND LEADEN RESTED ON A HAND THAT WAS SPARE AND FEEBLE
5791-31920-0019 HER BROW SEEMED TO BEAR THE MARKS OF THAT CROWN OF THORNS WHICH IS THE DIADEM OF RESIGNATION I THOUGHT OF THE COTTAGE HOW YOUNG SHE WAS SIX MONTHS AGO HOW CHEERFUL HOW FREE HOW CARELESS WHAT HAD I DONE WITH ALL THAT
5791-31920-0020 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT A STRANGE VOICE REPEATED AN OLD ROMANCE THAT I HAD LONG SINCE FORGOTTEN ALTRA VOLTA GIERI BIELE BLANCH E ROSSA COM UN FLORE MA ORA NO
5791-31920-0021 CONSUMATIS DAL AMORE MY SORROW WAS TOO GREAT I SPRANG TO MY FEET AND ONCE MORE BEGAN TO WALK THE FLOOR YES I CONTINUED LOOK AT HER THINK OF THOSE WHO ARE CONSUMED BY A GRIEF THAT IS NOT SHARED WITH ANOTHER
5791-31920-0022 THE EVILS YOU ENDURE OTHERS HAVE SUFFERED AND NOTHING IS SINGULAR OR PECULIAR TO YOU THINK OF THOSE WHO HAVE NO MOTHER NO RELATIVES NO FRIENDS OF THOSE WHO SEEK AND DO NOT FIND OF THOSE WHO LOVE IN VAIN OF THOSE WHO DIE AND ARE FORGOTTEN
5791-31920-0023 BEFORE THEE THERE ON THAT BED LIES A BEING THAT NATURE PERCHANCE FORMED FOR THEE
5791-31920-0024 THAT SOUL AND THAT BODY ARE THY BROTHERS FOR SIX MONTHS THY MOUTH HAS NOT SPOKEN THY HEART HAS NOT THROBBED WITHOUT A RESPONSIVE WORD AND HEART BEAT FROM HER AND THAT WOMAN WHOM GOD HAS SENT THEE AS HE SENDS THE ROSE TO THE FIELD
5791-31920-0025 IF THY SOBS DO NOT AWAKEN HER LITTLE BY LITTLE MY THOUGHTS MOUNTED AND BECAME MORE SOMBER UNTIL I RECOILED IN TERROR TO DO EVIL SUCH WAS THE ROLE IMPOSED UPON ME BY PROVIDENCE I TO DO EVIL
5791-31920-0026 I TO WHOM MY CONSCIENCE EVEN IN THE MIDST OF MY WILDEST FOLLIES SAID THAT I WAS GOOD I WHOM A PITILESS DESTINY WAS DRAGGING SWIFTLY TOWARD THE ABYSS AND WHOM A SECRET HORROR UNCEASINGLY WARNED OF THE AWFUL FATE TO COME
5791-31920-0027 I DO EVIL FOR SIX MONTHS I HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN THAT TASK NOT A DAY HAD PASSED THAT I HAD NOT WORKED AT THAT IMPIOUS OCCUPATION AND I HAD AT THAT MOMENT THE PROOF BEFORE MY EYES
5791-31920-0028 WHO HAD OFFENDED HER THEN INSULTED HER THEN ABANDONED HER ONLY TO TAKE HER BACK AGAIN TREMBLING WITH FEAR BESET WITH SUSPICION FINALLY THROWN ON THAT BED OF SORROW WHERE SHE NOW LAY EXTENDED WAS I
5791-31920-0029 I BEAT MY BREAST AND ALTHOUGH LOOKING AT HER I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT I TOUCHED HER AS THOUGH TO ASSURE MYSELF THAT IT WAS NOT A DREAM MY FACE AS I SAW IT IN THE GLASS REGARDED ME WITH ASTONISHMENT
5791-31920-0030 WHO WAS THAT CREATURE WHO APPEARED BEFORE ME BEARING MY FEATURES WHO WAS THAT PITILESS MAN WHO BLASPHEMED WITH MY MOUTH AND TORTURED WITH MY HANDS WAS IT HE WHOM MY MOTHER CALLED OCTAVE WAS IT HE WHO AT FIFTEEN
5791-31920-0031 LEANING OVER THE CRYSTAL WATERS OF A FOUNTAIN HAD A HEART NOT LESS PURE THAN THEY I CLOSED MY EYES AND THOUGHT OF MY CHILDHOOD DAYS AS A RAY OF LIGHT PIERCES A CLOUD A GLEAM FROM THE PAST PIERCED MY HEART NO I MUSED I DID NOT DO THAT
5791-31920-0032 THESE THINGS ARE BUT AN ABSURD DREAM I RECALLED THE TIME WHEN I WAS IGNORANT OF LIFE WHEN I WAS TAKING MY FIRST STEPS IN EXPERIENCE I REMEMBERED AN OLD BEGGAR WHO USED TO SIT ON A STONE BENCH BEFORE THE FARM GATE TO WHOM I WAS SOMETIMES SENT WITH THE REMAINS OF OUR MORNING MEAL
5791-31920-0033 HOLDING OUT HIS FEEBLE WRINKLED HANDS HE WOULD BLESS ME AS HE SMILED UPON ME I FELT THE MORNING WIND BLOWING ON MY BROW AND A FRESHNESS AS OF THE ROSE DESCENDING FROM HEAVEN INTO MY SOUL THEN I OPENED MY EYES AND BY THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP SAW THE REALITY BEFORE ME
5791-31920-0034 AND YOU DO NOT BELIEVE YOURSELF GUILTY I DEMANDED WITH HORROR O NOVICE OF YESTERDAY HOW CORRUPT TO DAY BECAUSE YOU WEEP YOU FONDLY IMAGINE YOURSELF INNOCENT WHAT YOU CONSIDER THE EVIDENCE OF YOUR CONSCIENCE IS ONLY REMORSE AND WHAT MURDERER DOES NOT EXPERIENCE IT
5791-31920-0035 IF YOUR VIRTUE CRIES OUT IS IT NOT BECAUSE IT FEELS THE APPROACH OF DEATH O WRETCH THOSE FAR OFF VOICES THAT YOU HEAR GROANING IN YOUR HEART DO YOU THINK THEY ARE SOBS THEY ARE PERHAPS ONLY THE CRY OF THE SEA MEW
5791-31920-0036 WHOSE PRESENCE PORTENDS SHIPWRECK WHO HAS EVER TOLD THE STORY OF THE CHILDHOOD OF THOSE WHO HAVE DIED STAINED WITH HUMAN BLOOD THEY ALSO HAVE BEEN GOOD IN THEIR DAY THEY SOMETIMES BURY THEIR FACES IN THEIR HANDS AND THINK OF THOSE HAPPY DAYS YOU DO EVIL AND YOU REPENT
5791-31920-0037 NERO DID THE SAME WHEN HE KILLED HIS MOTHER WHO HAS TOLD YOU THAT TEARS CAN WASH AWAY THE STAINS OF GUILT AND EVEN IF IT WERE TRUE THAT A PART OF YOUR SOUL IS NOT DEVOTED TO EVIL FOREVER WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THE OTHER PART THAT IS NOT YOURS
5791-31920-0038 YOU WILL TOUCH WITH YOUR LEFT HAND THE WOUNDS THAT YOU INFLICT WITH YOUR RIGHT YOU WILL MAKE A SHROUD OF YOUR VIRTUE IN WHICH TO BURY YOUR CRIMES
5791-31920-0039 INTO THE HEART OF THE BEING WHO OPENS HER ARMS TO YOU YOU WILL PLUNGE THAT BLOOD STAINED BUT REPENTANT ARM
5791-31920-0040 YOU WILL SPEAK OF YOUR YOUTH AND YOU WILL PERSUADE YOURSELF THAT HEAVEN OUGHT TO PARDON YOU THAT YOUR MISFORTUNES ARE INVOLUNTARY AND YOU WILL IMPLORE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS TO GRANT YOU A LITTLE REPOSE BUT WHO KNOWS YOU ARE STILL YOUNG
5791-31920-0041 THE MORE YOU TRUST IN YOUR HEART THE FARTHER ASTRAY YOU WILL BE LEAD BY YOUR PRIDE TO DAY YOU STAND BEFORE THE FIRST RUIN YOU ARE GOING TO LEAVE ON YOUR ROUTE IF BRIGITTE DIES TO MORROW YOU WILL WEEP ON HER TOMB WHERE WILL YOU GO WHEN YOU LEAVE HER
5791-31920-0042 AND YOU WILL SAY SOME BEAUTIFUL MORNING SITTING IN YOUR INN WITH YOUR GLASSES BEFORE YOU THAT IT IS TIME TO FORGET IN ORDER TO LIVE AGAIN YOU WHO WEEP TOO LATE TAKE CARE LEST YOU WEEP MORE THAN ONE DAY
5791-31920-0043 WHO KNOWS WHEN THE PRESENT WHICH MAKES YOU SHUDDER SHALL HAVE BECOME THE PAST AN OLD STORY A CONFUSED MEMORY MAY IT NOT HAPPEN SOME NIGHT OF DEBAUCHERY THAT YOU WILL OVERTURN YOUR CHAIR AND RECOUNT WITH A SMILE ON YOUR LIPS WHAT YOU WITNESSED WITH TEARS IN YOUR EYES
5791-31920-0044 IT IS THUS THAT ONE DRINKS AWAY SHAME YOU HAVE BEGUN BY BEING GOOD YOU WILL BECOME WEAK AND YOU WILL BECOME A MONSTER MY POOR FRIEND SAID I FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART I HAVE A WORD OF ADVICE FOR YOU AND IT IS THIS I BELIEVE THAT YOU MUST DIE
5791-31920-0045 WHILE THERE IS STILL SOME VIRTUE LEFT PROFIT BY IT IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY NOT BECOME ALTOGETHER BAD WHILE A WOMAN YOU LOVE LIES THERE DYING ON THAT BED AND WHILE YOU HAVE A HORROR OF YOURSELF STRIKE THE DECISIVE BLOW SHE STILL LIVES THAT IS ENOUGH
5791-31920-0046 DO NOT ATTEND HER FUNERAL OBSEQUIES FOR FEAR THAT ON THE MORROW YOU WILL NOT BE CONSOLED TURN THE POIGNARD AGAINST YOUR OWN HEART WHILE THAT HEART YET LOVES THE GOD WHO MADE IT IS IT YOUR YOUTH THAT MAKES YOU PAUSE AND WOULD YOU SPARE THOSE YOUTHFUL LOCKS
5791-31920-0047 NEVER ALLOW THEM TO WHITEN IF THEY ARE NOT WHITE TO NIGHT AND THEN WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN THE WORLD IF YOU GO AWAY WHERE WILL YOU GO WHAT CAN YOU HOPE FOR IF YOU REMAIN AH IN LOOKING AT THAT WOMAN YOU SEEM TO HAVE A TREASURE BURIED IN YOUR HEART IT IS NOT MERELY THAT YOU LOSE HER
5791-31920-0048 IT IS LESS WHAT HAS BEEN THAN WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WHEN THE HANDS OF THE CLOCK INDICATED SUCH AND SUCH AN HOUR YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN HAPPY IF YOU SUFFER WHY DO YOU NOT OPEN YOUR HEART IF YOU LOVE WHY DO YOU NOT SAY SO WHY DO YOU DIE OF HUNGER CLASPING A PRICELESS TREASURE IN YOUR HANDS
5791-31920-0049 YOU HAVE CLOSED THE DOOR YOU MISER YOU DEBATE WITH YOURSELF BEHIND LOCKS AND BOLTS SHAKE THEM FOR IT WAS YOUR HAND THAT FORGED THEM O FOOL WHO HAVE DESIRED AND HAVE POSSESSED YOUR DESIRE YOU HAVE NOT THOUGHT OF GOD
5791-31920-0050 YOU TREAT IT WITH DISDAIN YOU SMILE AT IT AND YOU CONTINUE TO AMUSE YOURSELF WITH IT FORGETTING HOW MANY PRAYERS IT HAS COST YOUR GOOD ANGEL TO PRESERVE FOR YOU THAT SHADOW OF DAYLIGHT AH IF THERE IS IN HEAVEN ONE WHO WATCHES OVER YOU WHAT IS HE DOING AT THIS MOMENT
5791-31920-0051 HE IS SEATED BEFORE AN ORGAN HIS WINGS ARE HALF FOLDED HIS HANDS EXTENDED OVER THE IVORY KEYS HE BEGINS AN ETERNAL HYMN THE HYMN OF LOVE AND IMMORTAL REST BUT HIS WINGS DROOP HIS HEAD FALLS OVER THE KEYS THE ANGEL OF DEATH HAS TOUCHED HIM ON THE SHOULDER
5791-31920-0052 YOU SAW A BETTER TIME SHINING IN THE FUTURE WHEN YOUR LIFE CONSECRATED TO THE OBJECT OF YOUR ADORATION GAVE PROMISE OF NEW STRENGTH AT THAT MOMENT THE ABYSS YAWNS BEFORE YOU
5791-31920-0053 YOU NO LONGER EXPERIENCE VAGUE DESIRES BUT REAL REGRETS YOUR HEART IS NO LONGER HUNGRY IT IS BROKEN AND YOU HESITATE WHAT DO YOU EXPECT SINCE SHE NO LONGER CARES FOR YOUR LIFE IT COUNTS FOR NOTHING SINCE SHE ABANDONS YOU ABANDON YOURSELF
5791-31920-0054 LET THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED YOU IN YOUR YOUTH WEEP FOR YOU THEY ARE NOT MANY IF YOU WOULD LIVE YOU MUST NOT ONLY FORGET LOVE
5791-31920-0055 NOT ONLY DENY WHAT THERE HAS BEEN OF GOOD IN YOU BUT KILL ALL THAT MAY BE GOOD IN THE FUTURE FOR WHAT WILL YOU DO IF YOU REMEMBER LIFE FOR YOU WOULD BE ONE CEASELESS REGRET NO NO YOU MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN YOUR SOUL AND YOUR BODY YOU MUST KILL ONE OR THE OTHER
5791-31920-0056 THE MEMORY OF THE GOOD DRIVES YOU TO THE EVIL MAKE A CORPSE OF YOURSELF UNLESS YOU WISH TO BECOME YOUR OWN SPECTER O CHILD CHILD DIE WHILE YOU CAN MAY TEARS BE SHED OVER THY GRAVE
5791-31920-0057 I THREW MYSELF ON THE FOOT OF THE BED IN SUCH A FRIGHTFUL STATE OF DESPAIR THAT MY REASON FLED AND I NO LONGER KNEW WHERE I WAS OR WHAT I WAS DOING BRIGITTE SIGHED MY SENSES STIRRED WITHIN ME WAS IT GRIEF OR DESPAIR I DO NOT KNOW
5791-31920-0058 SUDDENLY A HORRIBLE IDEA OCCURRED TO ME WHAT I MUTTERED LEAVE THAT FOR ANOTHER DIE DESCEND INTO THE GROUND WHILE THAT BOSOM HEAVES WITH THE AIR OF HEAVEN JUST GOD ANOTHER HAND THAN MINE ON THAT FINE TRANSPARENT SKIN
5791-31920-0059 ANOTHER MOUTH ON THOSE LIPS ANOTHER LOVE IN THAT HEART BRIGITTE HAPPY LOVING ADORED AND I IN A CORNER OF THE CEMETERY CRUMBLING INTO DUST IN A DITCH HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE HER TO FORGET ME IF I CEASE TO EXIST TO MORROW HOW MANY TEARS WILL SHE SHED
5791-31920-0060 NONE PERHAPS NOT A FRIEND WHO SPEAKS TO HER BUT WILL SAY THAT MY DEATH WAS A GOOD THING WHO WILL NOT HASTEN TO CONSOLE HER WHO WILL NOT URGE HER TO FORGET ME IF SHE WEEPS THEY WILL SEEK TO DISTRACT HER ATTENTION FROM HER LOSS IF MEMORY HAUNTS HER THEY WILL TAKE HER AWAY
5791-31920-0061 IF HER LOVE FOR ME SURVIVES ME THEY WILL SEEK TO CURE HER AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN POISONED AND SHE HERSELF WHO WILL PERHAPS AT FIRST SAY THAT SHE DESIRES TO FOLLOW ME WILL A MONTH LATER TURN ASIDE TO AVOID THE WEEPING WILLOW PLANTED OVER MY GRAVE HOW COULD IT BE OTHERWISE
5791-31920-0062 WHO AS BEAUTIFUL AS SHE WASTES LIFE IN IDLE REGRETS IF SHE SHOULD THINK OF DYING OF GRIEF THAT BEAUTIFUL BOSOM WOULD URGE HER TO LIVE AND HER GLASS WOULD PERSUADE HER AND THE DAY WHEN HER EXHAUSTED TEARS GIVE PLACE TO THE FIRST SMILE
5791-31920-0063 WHO WILL NOT CONGRATULATE HER ON HER RECOVERY WHEN AFTER EIGHT DAYS OF SILENCE SHE CONSENTS TO HEAR MY NAME PRONOUNCED IN HER PRESENCE THEN SHE WILL SPEAK OF IT HERSELF AS THOUGH TO SAY CONSOLE ME THEN LITTLE BY LITTLE SHE WILL NO LONGER REFUSE TO THINK OF THE PAST
5791-31920-0064 BUT WILL SPEAK OF IT AND SHE WILL OPEN HER WINDOW SOME BEAUTIFUL SPRING MORNING WHEN THE BIRDS ARE SINGING IN THE GARDEN SHE WILL BECOME PENSIVE AND SAY I HAVE LOVED WHO WILL BE THERE AT HER SIDE WHO WILL DARE TO TELL HER THAT SHE MUST CONTINUE TO LOVE AH
5791-31920-0065 THEN I WILL BE NO MORE YOU WILL LISTEN TO HIM FAITHLESS ONE YOU WILL BLUSH AS DOES THE BUDDING ROSE AND THE BLOOD OF YOUTH WILL MOUNT TO YOUR FACE WHILE SAYING THAT YOUR HEART IS SEALED YOU WILL ALLOW IT TO ESCAPE THROUGH THAT FRESH AUREOLE OF BEAUTY EACH RAY OF WHICH ALLURES A KISS
5791-31920-0066 HOW MUCH THEY DESIRE TO BE LOVED WHO SAY THEY LOVE NO MORE AND WHY SHOULD THAT ASTONISH YOU YOU ARE A WOMAN THAT BODY THAT SPOTLESS BOSOM YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE WORTH
5791-31920-0067 HOW CAN THE WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN PRAISED RESOLVE TO BE PRAISED NO MORE DOES SHE THINK SHE IS LIVING WHEN SHE REMAINS IN THE SHADOW AND THERE IS SILENCE ROUND ABOUT HER BEAUTY HER BEAUTY ITSELF IS THE ADMIRING GLANCE OF HER LOVER
5791-31920-0068 NO NO THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF IT WHO HAS LOVED CAN NOT LIVE WITHOUT LOVE WHO HAS SEEN DEATH CLINGS TO LIFE BRIGITTE LOVES ME AND WILL PERHAPS DIE OF LOVE I WILL KILL MYSELF AND ANOTHER WILL HAVE HER
5791-31920-0069 ANOTHER ANOTHER I REPEATED BENDING OVER HER UNTIL MY HEAD TOUCHED HER SHOULDER IS SHE NOT A WIDOW HAS SHE NOT ALREADY SEEN DEATH HAVE NOT THESE LITTLE HANDS PREPARED THE DEAD FOR BURIAL
5791-31920-0070 AH GOD FORGIVE ME WHILE SHE SLEEPS WHY SHOULD I NOT KILL HER IF I SHOULD AWAKEN HER NOW AND TELL HER THAT HER HOUR HAD COME AND THAT WE WERE GOING TO DIE WITH A LAST KISS SHE WOULD CONSENT WHAT DOES IT MATTER IS IT CERTAIN THAT ALL DOES NOT END WITH THAT
5791-31920-0071 I FOUND A KNIFE ON THE TABLE AND I PICKED IT UP FEAR COWARDICE SUPERSTITION WHAT DO THEY KNOW ABOUT IT WHO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE BEYOND IT IS FOR THE IGNORANT COMMON PEOPLE THAT A FUTURE LIFE HAS BEEN INVENTED BUT WHO REALLY BELIEVES IN IT
5791-31920-0072 WHAT WATCHER IN THE CEMETERY HAS SEEN DEATH LEAVE HIS TOMB AND HOLD CONSULTATION WITH A PRIEST IN OLDEN TIMES THERE WERE FANTOMS THEY ARE INTERDICTED BY THE POLICE IN CIVILIZED CITIES AND NO CRIES ARE NOW HEARD ISSUING FROM THE EARTH EXCEPT FROM THOSE BURIED IN HASTE
5791-31920-0073 GOD HAS ESTABLISHED IT MAN DISCUSSES IT BUT OVER EVERY DOOR IS WRITTEN DO WHAT THOU WILT THOU SHALT DIE WHAT WILL BE SAID IF I KILL BRIGITTE NEITHER OF US WILL HEAR
5791-31920-0074 IN TO MORROW'S JOURNAL WOULD APPEAR THE INTELLIGENCE THAT OCTAVE DE T HAD KILLED HIS MISTRESS AND THE DAY AFTER NO ONE WOULD SPEAK OF IT WHO WOULD FOLLOW US TO THE GRAVE NO ONE WHO UPON RETURNING TO HIS HOME COULD NOT ENJOY A HEARTY DINNER
5791-31920-0075 AND WHEN WE WERE EXTENDED SIDE BY SIDE IN OUR NARROW BED THE WORLD COULD WALK OVER OUR GRAVES WITHOUT DISTURBING US IS IT NOT TRUE MY WELL BELOVED IS IT NOT TRUE THAT IT WOULD BE WELL WITH US IT IS A SOFT BED THAT BED OF EARTH NO SUFFERING CAN REACH US THERE
5791-31920-0076 THE OCCUPANTS OF THE NEIGHBORING TOMBS WILL NOT GOSSIP ABOUT US OUR BONES WILL EMBRACE IN PEACE AND WITHOUT PRIDE FOR DEATH IS SOLACE AND THAT WHICH BINDS DOES NOT ALSO SEPARATE WHY SHOULD ANNIHILATION FRIGHTEN THEE POOR BODY DESTINED TO CORRUPTION
5791-31920-0077 EVERY HOUR THAT STRIKES DRAGS THEE ON TO THY DOOM EVERY STEP BREAKS THE ROUND ON WHICH THOU HAST JUST RESTED THOU ART NOURISHED BY THE DEAD THE AIR OF HEAVEN WEIGHS UPON AND CRUSHES THEE THE EARTH ON WHICH THOU TREADEST ATTACKS THEE BY THE SOLES OF THY FEET
5791-31920-0078 DOWN WITH THEE WHY ART THOU AFFRIGHTED
5791-31920-0079 MERELY SAY WE WILL NOT LIVE IS NOT LIFE A BURDEN THAT WE LONG TO LAY DOWN WHY HESITATE WHEN IT IS MERELY A QUESTION OF A LITTLE SOONER OR A LITTLE LATER MATTER IS INDESTRUCTIBLE
5791-31920-0080 AND THE PHYSICISTS WE ARE TOLD GRIND TO INFINITY THE SMALLEST SPECK OF DUST WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO ANNIHILATE IT IF MATTER IS THE PROPERTY OF CHANCE WHAT HARM CAN IT DO TO CHANGE ITS FORM SINCE IT CAN NOT CEASE TO BE MATTER
5791-31920-0081 WHY SHOULD GOD CARE WHAT FORM I HAVE RECEIVED AND WITH WHAT LIVERY I INVEST MY GRIEF SUFFERING LIVES IN MY BRAIN IT BELONGS TO ME I KILL IT BUT MY BONES DO NOT BELONG TO ME AND I RETURN THEM TO HIM WHO LENT THEM TO ME
5791-31920-0082 MAY SOME POET MAKE A CUP OF MY SKULL FROM WHICH TO DRINK HIS NEW WINE WHAT REPROACH CAN I INCUR AND WHAT HARM CAN THAT REPROACH DO ME WHAT STERN JUDGE WILL TELL ME THAT I HAVE DONE WRONG WHAT DOES HE KNOW ABOUT IT WAS HE SUCH AS I
5791-31920-0083 IF EVERY CREATURE HAS HIS TASK TO PERFORM AND IF IT IS A CRIME TO SHIRK IT WHAT CULPRITS ARE THE BABES WHO DIE ON THE NURSE'S BREAST WHY SHOULD THEY BE SPARED WHO WILL BE INSTRUCTED BY THE LESSONS WHICH ARE TAUGHT AFTER DEATH MUST HEAVEN BE A DESERT IN ORDER THAT MAN MAY BE PUNISHED FOR HAVING LIVED
5791-31920-0084 WHO AMUSES HIMSELF AND WHILES AWAY AN IDLE HOUR WATCHING THIS SPECTACLE OF CREATION ALWAYS RENEWED AND ALWAYS DYING SEEING THE WORK OF MAN'S HANDS RISING THE GRASS GROWING LOOKING UPON THE PLANTING OF THE SEED AND THE FALL OF THE THUNDERBOLT
5791-31920-0085 BEHOLDING MAN WALKING ABOUT UPON HIS EARTH UNTIL HE MEETS THE BECKONING FINGER OF DEATH COUNTING TEARS AND WATCHING THEM DRY UPON THE CHEEK OF PAIN NOTING THE PURE PROFILE OF LOVE AND THE WRINKLED FACE OF AGE SEEING HANDS STRETCHED UP TO HIM IN SUPPLICATION
5791-31920-0086 BODIES PROSTRATE BEFORE HIM AND NOT A BLADE OF WHEAT MORE IN THE HARVEST WHO IS IT THEN WHO HAS MADE SO MUCH FOR THE PLEASURE OF KNOWING THAT IT ALL AMOUNTS TO NOTHING THE EARTH IS DYING HERSCHELL SAYS IT IS OF COLD
5791-31920-0087 WHO HOLDS IN HIS HAND THE DROP OF CONDENSED VAPOR AND WATCHES IT AS IT DRIES UP AS AN ANGLER WATCHES A GRAIN OF SAND IN HIS HAND THAT MIGHTY LAW OF ATTRACTION THAT SUSPENDS THE WORLD IN SPACE TORMENTS IT AND CONSUMES IT IN ENDLESS DESIRE
5791-31920-0088 THE BEINGS MOVE ABOUT CROSS EACH OTHER'S PATHS CLASP EACH OTHER FOR AN HOUR AND THEN FALL AND OTHERS RISE IN THEIR PLACE WHERE LIFE FAILS LIFE HASTENS TO THE SPOT WHERE AIR IS WANTING AIR RUSHES
5791-31920-0089 NO DISORDER EVERYTHING IS REGULATED MARKED OUT WRITTEN DOWN IN LINES OF GOLD AND PARABLES OF FIRE EVERYTHING KEEPS STEP WITH THE CELESTIAL MUSIC ALONG THE PITILESS PATHS OF LIFE AND ALL FOR NOTHING
5791-31920-0090 AND WE POOR NAMELESS DREAMS PALE AND SORROWFUL APPARITIONS HELPLESS EPHEMERA WE WHO ARE ANIMATED BY THE BREATH OF A SECOND IN ORDER THAT DEATH MAY EXIST WE EXHAUST OURSELVES WITH FATIGUE IN ORDER TO PROVE THAT WE ARE LIVING FOR A PURPOSE
5791-31920-0091 AND THAT SOMETHING INDEFINABLE IS STIRRING WITHIN US WE HESITATE TO TURN AGAINST OUR BREASTS A LITTLE PIECE OF STEEL OR BLOW OUT OUR BRAINS WITH A LITTLE INSTRUMENT NO LARGER THAN OUR HAND IT SEEMS TO US THAT CHAOS WOULD RETURN AGAIN
5791-31920-0092 WE HAVE WRITTEN AND REVISED THE LAWS BOTH HUMAN AND DIVINE AND WE ARE AFRAID OF OUR CATECHISMS WE SUFFER THIRTY YEARS WITHOUT MURMURING AND IMAGINE THAT WE ARE STRUGGLING FINALLY SUFFERING BECOMES THE STRONGER WE SEND A PINCH OF POWDER INTO THE SANCTUARY OF INTELLIGENCE
5791-31920-0093 AND A FLOWER PIERCES THE SOIL ABOVE OUR GRAVE AS I FINISHED THESE WORDS I DIRECTED THE KNIFE I HELD IN MY HAND AGAINST BRIGITTE'S BOSOM I WAS NO LONGER MASTER OF MYSELF AND IN MY DELIRIOUS CONDITION I KNOW NOT WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED
5791-31920-0094 I THREW BACK THE BEDCLOTHING TO UNCOVER THE HEART WHEN I DISCOVERED ON HER WHITE BOSOM A LITTLE EBONY CRUCIFIX I RECOILED SEIZED WITH SUDDEN FEAR MY HAND RELAXED MY WEAPON FELL TO THE FLOOR IT WAS BRIGITTE'S AUNT WHO HAD GIVEN HER THAT LITTLE CRUCIFIX ON HER DEATH BED
5791-31920-0095 I DID NOT REMEMBER EVER HAVING SEEN IT BEFORE DOUBTLESS AT THE MOMENT OF SETTING OUT SHE HAD SUSPENDED IT ABOUT HER NECK AS A PRESERVING CHARM AGAINST THE DANGERS OF THE JOURNEY SUDDENLY I JOINED MY HANDS AND KNELT ON THE FLOOR
5791-31920-0096 O LORD MY GOD I SAID IN TREMBLING TONES LORD MY GOD THOU ART THERE
5791-31920-0097 I NO LONGER DISBELIEVED IN HIM NEITHER AS A CHILD NOR AT SCHOOL NOR AS A MAN HAVE I FREQUENTED CHURCHES MY RELIGION IF I HAD ANY HAD NEITHER RITE NOR SYMBOL AND I BELIEVED IN A GOD WITHOUT FORM WITHOUT A CULT AND WITHOUT REVELATION
5791-31920-0098 THE STERILE MILK OF IMPIETY HUMAN PRIDE THAT GOD OF THE EGOIST CLOSED MY MOUTH AGAINST PRAYER WHILE MY AFFRIGHTED SOUL TOOK REFUGE IN THE HOPE OF NOTHINGNESS I WAS AS THOUGH DRUNKEN OR INSENSATE WHEN I SAW THAT EFFIGY OF CHRIST ON BRIGITTE'S BOSOM
5791-31920-0099 WHILE NOT BELIEVING IN HIM MYSELF I RECOILED KNOWING THAT SHE BELIEVED IN HIM IT WAS NOT VAIN TERROR THAT ARRESTED MY HAND WHO SAW ME I WAS ALONE AND IT WAS NIGHT WAS IT PREJUDICE WHAT PREVENTED ME FROM HURLING OUT OF MY SIGHT THAT LITTLE PIECE OF BLACK WOOD
5791-31920-0100 ALTHOUGH I HAD ALMOST COMMITTED A CRIME WHEN MY HAND WAS ARRESTED I FELT THAT MY HEART WAS INNOCENT IN AN INSTANT CALM SELF POSSESSION REASON RETURNED I AGAIN APPROACHED THE BED I LEANED OVER MY IDOL AND KISSED THE CRUCIFIX
5791-31920-0101 SLEEP IN PEACE I SAID TO HER GOD WATCHES OVER YOU WHILE YOUR LIPS WERE PARTING IN A SMILE YOU WERE IN GREATER DANGER THAN YOU HAVE EVER KNOWN BEFORE BUT THE HAND THAT THREATENED YOU WILL HARM NO ONE I SWEAR BY THE FAITH YOU PROFESS I WILL NOT KILL EITHER YOU OR MYSELF
5791-31920-0102 I AM A FOOL A MADMAN A CHILD WHO THINKS HIMSELF A MAN GOD BE PRAISED YOU ARE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL YOU LIVE AND YOU WILL FORGET ME
5791-31920-0103 IF YOU CAN FORGIVE ME SLEEP IN PEACE UNTIL DAY BRIGITTE AND THEN DECIDE OUR FATE WHATEVER SENTENCE YOU PRONOUNCE I WILL SUBMIT WITHOUT COMPLAINT AND THOU LORD WHO HAST SAVED ME GRANT ME PARDON
5791-31920-0104 I WAS BORN IN AN IMPIOUS CENTURY AND I HAVE MANY CRIMES TO EXPIATE THOU SON OF GOD WHOM MEN FORGET I HAVE NOT BEEN TAUGHT TO LOVE THEE I HAVE NEVER WORSHIPED IN THY TEMPLES BUT I THANK HEAVEN THAT WHERE I FIND THEE I TREMBLE AND BOW IN REVERENCE
5791-31920-0105 I HAVE AT LEAST KISSED WITH MY LIPS A HEART THAT IS FULL OF THEE PROTECT THAT HEART SO LONG AS LIFE LASTS DWELL WITHIN IT THOU HOLY ONE A POOR UNFORTUNATE HAS BEEN BRAVE ENOUGH TO DEFY DEATH AT THE SIGHT OF THY SUFFERING AND THY DEATH
5791-31920-0106 THOUGH IMPIOUS THOU HAST SAVED HIM FROM EVIL IF HE HAD BELIEVED THOU WOULDST HAVE CONSOLED HIM PARDON THOSE WHO HAVE MADE HIM INCREDULOUS SINCE THOU HAST MADE HIM REPENTANT PARDON THOSE WHO BLASPHEME
