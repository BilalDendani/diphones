2301-157471-0000 WHEN RAGGEDY ANDY WAS FIRST BROUGHT TO THE NURSERY
2301-157471-0001 RAGGEDY ANDY DID NOT SPEAK ALL DAY BUT HE SMILED PLEASANTLY TO ALL THE OTHER DOLLS THERE WAS RAGGEDY ANN THE FRENCH DOLL HENNY THE LITTLE DUTCH DOLL UNCLE CLEM
2301-157471-0002 AND A FEW OTHERS SOME OF THE DOLLS WERE WITHOUT ARMS AND LEGS ONE HAD A CRACKED HEAD SHE WAS A NICE DOLL THOUGH AND THE OTHERS ALL LIKED HER VERY MUCH
2301-157471-0003 ALL OF THEM HAD CRIED THE NIGHT SUSAN THAT WAS HER NAME FELL OFF THE TOY BOX AND CRACKED HER CHINA HEAD RAGGEDY ANDY DID NOT SPEAK ALL DAY
2301-157471-0004 BUT THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS FACT AFTER ALL NONE OF THE OTHER DOLLS SPOKE ALL DAY EITHER MARCELLA HAD PLAYED IN THE NURSERY ALL DAY AND OF COURSE THEY DID NOT SPEAK IN FRONT OF HER
2301-157471-0005 MARCELLA THOUGHT THEY DID THOUGH AND OFTEN HAD THEM SAYING THINGS WHICH THEY REALLY WERE NOT EVEN THINKING OF FOR INSTANCE WHEN MARCELLA SERVED WATER WITH SUGAR IN IT AND LITTLE OYSTER CRACKERS FOR TEA
2301-157471-0006 RAGGEDY ANDY WAS THINKING OF RAGGEDY ANN AND THE FRENCH DOLL WAS THINKING OF ONE TIME WHEN FIDO WAS LOST MARCELLA TOOK THE FRENCH DOLL'S HAND AND PASSED A CUP OF TEA TO RAGGEDY ANDY AND SAID
2301-157471-0007 MISTER RAGGEDY ANDY WILL YOU HAVE ANOTHER CUP OF TEA AS IF THE FRENCH DOLL WAS TALKING AND THEN MARCELLA ANSWERED FOR RAGGEDY ANDY OH YES THANK YOU IT IS SO DELICIOUS
2301-157471-0008 NEITHER THE FRENCH DOLL NOR RAGGEDY ANDY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON FOR THEY WERE THINKING REAL HARD TO THEMSELVES
2301-157471-0009 MARCELLA DRANK IT INSTEAD PERHAPS THIS WAS JUST AS WELL FOR MOST OF THE DOLLS WERE MOIST INSIDE FROM THE TEA OF THE DAY BEFORE MARCELLA DID NOT ALWAYS DRINK ALL OF THE TEA
2301-157471-0010 OFTEN SHE POURED A LITTLE DOWN THEIR MOUTHS SUGAR AND WATER IF TAKEN IN SMALL QUANTITIES WOULD NOT GIVE THE DOLLS COLIC MARCELLA WOULD TELL THEM
2301-157471-0011 AND FOUND THE DOLLS WITH SWEETS UPON THEIR FACES REALLY FIDO WAS QUITE A HELP IN THIS WAY BUT HE OFTEN MISSED THE CORNERS OF THEIR EYES AND THE BACKS OF THEIR NECKS WHERE THE TEA WOULD RUN AND GET STICKY
2301-157471-0012 BUT HE DID HIS BEST AND SAVED HIS LITTLE MISTRESS A LOT OF WORK NO RAGGEDY ANDY DID NOT SPEAK HE MERELY THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL
2301-157471-0013 DID NOT REALLY KNOW HOW LONG RAGGEDY ANDY AND SHE HAD BEEN RAG DOLLS IF RAGGEDY ANN HAD A PENCIL IN HER RAG HAND AND MARCELLA GUIDED IT FOR HER RAGGEDY ANN
2301-157471-0014 BUT HE DID NOT EVEN FIDGET OF COURSE HE FELL OUT OF HIS CHAIR ONCE AND HIS SHOE BUTTON EYES WENT CLICK AGAINST THE FLOOR BUT IT WASN'T HIS FAULT RAGGEDY ANDY WAS SO LOPPY
2301-157471-0015 HE COULD HARDLY BE PLACED IN A CHAIR SO THAT HE WOULD STAY AND MARCELLA JIGGLED THE TABLE
2301-157471-0016 YOU SEE HOW EASY IT IS TO PASS OVER THE LITTLE BUMPS OF LIFE IF WE ARE HAPPY INSIDE AND SO RAGGEDY ANDY WAS QUIET ALL DAY AND SO THE DAY FINALLY PASSED
2301-157471-0017 RAGGEDY ANDY WAS GIVEN ONE OF UNCLE CLEM'S CLEAN WHITE NIGHTIES AND SHARED UNCLE CLEM'S BED MARCELLA KISSED THEM ALL GOOD NIGHT AND LEFT THEM TO SLEEP UNTIL MORNING
2301-157471-0018 ALL THE DOLLIES JUMPED OUT OF THEIR BEDS
2301-157471-0019 HAVE ALWAYS LIKED EACH OTHER OH
2301-157471-0020 THE DOLLIES ALL ANSWERED WE LOVE RAGGEDY ANN BECAUSE SHE IS SO KINDLY AND HAPPY AND WE KNOW WE SHALL LIKE YOU TOO FOR YOU TALK LIKE RAGGEDY ANN AND HAVE THE SAME CHEERY SMILE
2301-157471-0021 NOW THAT WE KNOW EACH OTHER SO WELL WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A GAME UNCLE CLEM RAGGEDY ANDY CRIED AS HE CAUGHT UNCLE CLEM AND DANCED ABOUT THE FLOOR HENNY THE DUTCH DOLL
2301-157471-0022 RAGGEDY ANDY REPLIED FOR THERE WAS ALWAYS A NEST OF MICE DOWN IN THE CORNER OF THE TRUNK CUTE LITTLE MAMA AND DADDY MICE
2301-157471-0023 AND WHEN THE MAMA AND DADDY MICE WERE AWAY I USED TO CUDDLE THE TINY LITTLE BABY MICE NO WONDER YOU WERE NEVER LONESOME SAID UNCLE CLEM WHO WAS VERY KIND
2301-157471-0024 AND LOVED EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING
2301-157471-0025 BUT IT IS FAR MORE PLEASANT TO BE OUT AGAIN AND LIVING HERE WITH ALL YOU NICE FRIENDS SAID RAGGEDY ANDY AND ALL THE DOLLS THOUGHT SO TOO
