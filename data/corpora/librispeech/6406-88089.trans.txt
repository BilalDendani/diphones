6406-88089-0000 CHAPTER ONE ROSALIE RAIN RAIN RAIN HOW MERCILESSLY IT FELL ON THE FAIR FIELD THAT SUNDAY AFTERNOON
6406-88089-0001 EVERY MOMENT THE POOLS INCREASED AND THE MUD BECAME THICKER HOW DISMAL THE FAIR LOOKED THEN ON SATURDAY EVENING IT HAD BEEN BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED WITH ROWS OF FLARING NAPHTHA LIGHTS AND THE GRAND SHOWS
6406-88089-0002 IN THE MOST ARISTOCRATIC PART OF THE FIELD HAD BEEN ILLUMINATED WITH CROSSES STARS ANCHORS AND ALL MANNER OF DEVICES BUT THERE WERE NO LIGHTS NOW THERE WAS NOTHING TO CAST A HALO ROUND THE DIRTY WEATHER STAINED TENTS
6406-88089-0003 AND THE DINGY CARAVANS YET IN SPITE OF THIS AND IN SPITE OF THE RAIN A CROWD OF SUNDAY IDLERS LINGERED ABOUT THE FAIR
6406-88089-0004 PEEPING CURIOUSLY INTO THE DESERTED SHOWS AND MAKING MANY SCHEMES FOR FURTHER ENJOYMENT ON THE MORROW WHEN THE FAIR WAS ONCE MORE TO BE IN ITS GLORY INSIDE THE CARAVANS THE SHOW PEOPLE WERE CROUCHING OVER THEIR FIRES
6406-88089-0005 AND GRUMBLING AT THE WEATHER MURMURING AT HAVING TO PAY SO MUCH FOR THE GROUND ON WHICH THEIR SHOWS WERE ERECTED AT A TIME WHEN THEY WOULD BE LIKELY TO MAKE SO LITTLE PROFIT A LITTLE OLD MAN
6406-88089-0006 WITH A ROSY GOOD TEMPERED FACE WAS MAKING HIS WAY ACROSS THE SEA OF MUD WHICH DIVIDED THE SHOWS FROM EACH OTHER HE WAS EVIDENTLY NO IDLER IN THE FAIR HE HAD COME INTO IT THAT SUNDAY AFTERNOON
6406-88089-0007 FOR A DEFINITE PURPOSE AND HE DID NOT INTEND TO LEAVE IT UNTIL IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED AFTER CROSSING AN ALMOST IMPASSABLE PLACE HE CLIMBED THE STEPS LEADING TO ONE OF THE CARAVANS AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
6406-88089-0008 IT WAS A CURIOUS DOOR THE UPPER PART OF IT BEING USED AS A WINDOW WAS FILLED WITH GLASS BEHIND WHICH YOU COULD SEE TWO SMALL MUSLIN CURTAINS TIED UP WITH PINK RIBBON
6406-88089-0009 NO ONE CAME TO OPEN THE DOOR WHEN THE OLD MAN KNOCKED AND HE WAS ABOUT TO TURN AWAY WHEN SOME LITTLE BOYS WHO WERE STANDING NEAR CALLED OUT TO HIM RAP AGAIN SIR RAP AGAIN
6406-88089-0010 THERE'S A LITTLE LASS IN THERE SHE WENT IN A BIT SINCE DON'T YOU WISH YOU WAS HER SAID ONE OF THE LITTLE BOYS TO THE OTHER AY SAID THE LITTLE FELLOW I WISH OUR HOUSE WOULD MOVE ABOUT AND HAD LITTLE WINDOWS WITH WHITE CURTAINS AND PINK BOWS
6406-88089-0011 THE OLD MAN LAUGHED A HEARTY LAUGH AT THE CHILDREN'S TALK AND RAPPED AGAIN AT THE CARAVAN DOOR THIS TIME A FACE APPEARED BETWEEN THE MUSLIN CURTAINS AND PEERED CAUTIOUSLY OUT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY LITTLE FACE
6406-88089-0012 SO PRETTY THAT THE OLD MAN SIGHED TO HIMSELF WHEN HE SAW IT THEN THE SMALL HEAD TURNED ROUND AND SEEMED TO BE TELLING WHAT IT HAD SEEN TO SOME ONE WITHIN AND ASKING LEAVE TO ADMIT THE VISITOR
6406-88089-0013 FOR A MINUTE AFTERWARDS THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND THE OWNER OF THE PRETTY FACE STOOD BEFORE THE OLD MAN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL ABOUT TWELVE YEARS OF AGE VERY SLENDER AND DELICATE IN APPEARANCE
6406-88089-0014 HER HAIR WHICH WAS OF A RICH AUBURN COLOUR WAS HANGING DOWN TO HER WAIST AND HER EYES WERE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THE OLD MAN THOUGHT HE HAD EVER SEEN SHE WAS VERY POORLY DRESSED AND SHE SHIVERED AS THE DAMP
6406-88089-0015 COLD AIR RUSHED IN THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR GOOD AFTERNOON MY LITTLE DEAR SAID THE OLD MAN SHE WAS JUST GOING TO ANSWER HIM WHEN A VIOLENT FIT OF COUGHING FROM WITHIN CAUSED HER TO LOOK ROUND AND WHEN IT WAS OVER
6406-88089-0016 SHUT THE DOOR ROSALIE IT'S SO COLD ASK WHOEVER IT IS TO COME IN THE OLD MAN DID NOT WAIT FOR A SECOND INVITATION HE STEPPED INSIDE THE CARAVAN AND THE CHILD CLOSED THE DOOR
6406-88089-0017 IT WAS A VERY SMALL PLACE THERE WAS HARDLY ROOM FOR HIM TO STAND AT THE END OF THE CARAVAN WAS A NARROW BED SOMETHING LIKE A BERTH ON BOARD SHIP AND ON IT A WOMAN WAS LYING WHO WAS EVIDENTLY VERY ILL
6406-88089-0018 SHE WAS THE CHILD'S MOTHER THE OLD MAN FELT SURE SHE HAD THE SAME BEAUTIFUL EYES AND SUNNY HAIR THOUGH HER FACE WAS THIN AND WASTED THERE WAS NOT ROOM FOR MUCH FURNITURE IN THE SMALL CARAVAN
6406-88089-0019 A TINY STOVE THE CHIMNEY OF WHICH WENT THROUGH THE WOODEN ROOF A FEW PANS A SHELF CONTAINING CUPS AND SAUCERS AND TWO BOXES WHICH SERVED AS SEATS COMPLETELY FILLED IT THERE WAS ONLY JUST ROOM FOR THE OLD MAN TO STAND
6406-88089-0020 AND THE FIRE WAS SO NEAR HIM THAT HE WAS IN DANGER OF BEING SCORCHED ROSALIE HAD SEATED HERSELF ON ONE OF THE BOXES CLOSE TO HER MOTHER'S BED YOU MUST EXCUSE MY INTRUDING MA'AM SAID THE OLD MAN WITH A POLITE BOW
6406-88089-0021 BUT I'M SO FOND OF LITTLE FOLKS AND I'VE BROUGHT THIS LITTLE GIRL OF YOURS A PICTURE IF SHE WILL ACCEPT IT FROM ME A FLUSH OF PLEASURE CAME INTO THE CHILD'S FACE AS HE BROUGHT OUT OF HIS POCKET HIS PROMISED GIFT SHE SEIZED IT EAGERLY
6406-88089-0022 AND HELD IT UP BEFORE HER WITH EVIDENT DELIGHT WHILST HER MOTHER RAISED HERSELF ON HER ELBOW TO LOOK AT IT WITH HER IT WAS THE PICTURE OF A SHEPHERD WITH A VERY KIND AND COMPASSIONATE FACE WHO WAS BEARING HOME IN HIS BOSOM A LOST LAMB
6406-88089-0023 THE LAMB'S FLEECE WAS TORN IN SEVERAL PLACES AND THERE WERE MARKS OF BLOOD ON ITS BACK AS IF IT HAD BEEN ROUGHLY USED BY SOME CRUEL BEAST IN A RECENT STRUGGLE BUT THE SHEPHERD SEEMED TO HAVE SUFFERED MORE THAN THE LAMB
6406-88089-0024 FOR HE WAS WOUNDED IN MANY PLACES AND HIS BLOOD WAS FALLING IN LARGE DROPS ON THE GROUND YET HE DID NOT SEEM TO MIND IT HIS FACE WAS FULL OF LOVE AND FULL OF JOY AS HE LOOKED AT THE LAMB
6406-88089-0025 HE HAD FORGOTTEN HIS SORROW IN HIS JOY THAT THE LAMB WAS SAVED IN THE DISTANCE WERE SOME OF THE SHEPHERD'S FRIENDS WHO WERE COMING TO MEET HIM AND UNDERNEATH THE PICTURE WERE THESE WORDS PRINTED IN LARGE LETTERS
6406-88089-0026 REJOICE WITH ME FOR I HAVE FOUND MY SHEEP WHICH WAS LOST THERE IS JOY IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ANGELS OF GOD OVER ONE SINNER THAT REPENTETH THE LITTLE GIRL READ THE WORDS ALOUD IN A CLEAR
6406-88089-0027 DISTINCT VOICE AND HER MOTHER GAZED AT THE PICTURE WITH TEARS IN HER EYES THOSE ARE SWEET WORDS AIN'T THEY SAID THE OLD MAN YES SAID THE WOMAN WITH A SIGH I HAVE HEARD THEM MANY TIMES BEFORE
6406-88089-0028 HAS THE GOOD SHEPHERD EVER SAID THEM OF YOU MA'AM HAS HE EVER CALLED THE BRIGHT ANGELS TOGETHER AND SAID TO THEM OF YOU REJOICE WITH ME FOR I HAVE FOUND MY SHEEP WHICH WAS LOST
6406-88089-0029 THE WOMAN DID NOT SPEAK A FIT OF COUGHING CAME ON AND THE OLD MAN STOOD LOOKING AT HER WITH A VERY PITYING EXPRESSION YOU ARE VERY ILL MA'AM I'M AFRAID HE SAID YES
6406-88089-0030 VERY ILL GASPED THE WOMAN BITTERLY EVERY ONE CAN SEE THAT BUT AUGUSTUS THAT'S MY FATHER SAID THE LITTLE GIRL NO HE DOESN'T SEE IT REPEATED THE WOMAN
6406-88089-0031 HE THINKS I OUGHT TO GET UP AND ACT IN THE PLAY JUST AS USUAL I DID TRY AT THE LAST PLACE WE WENT TO BUT I FAINTED AS SOON AS MY PART WAS OVER AND I'VE BEEN IN BED EVER SINCE YOU MUST BE TIRED OF MOVING ABOUT MA'AM
6406-88089-0032 SAID THE OLD MAN COMPASSIONATELY TIRED SAID SHE I SHOULD THINK I WAS TIRED IT ISN'T WHAT I WAS BROUGHT UP TO I WAS BROUGHT UP TO A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF LIFE FROM THIS
6406-88089-0033 SHE SAID WITH A VERY DEEP DRAWN SIGH IT'S A WEARY TIME I HAVE OF IT A WEARY TIME ARE YOU ALWAYS ON THE MOVE MA'AM ASKED THE OLD MAN ALL THE SUMMER TIME SAID THE WOMAN
6406-88089-0034 AND THEN WE LET OURSELVES OUT TO SOME OF THE SMALL TOWN THEATRES BUT ALL THE REST OF THE YEAR WE'RE GOING FROM FEAST TO FEAST AND FROM FAIR TO FAIR NO REST NOR COMFORT NOT A BIT POOR THING
6406-88089-0035 POOR THING SAID THE OLD MAN AND THEN A CHOKING SENSATION APPEARED TO HAVE SEIZED HIM FOR HE CLEARED HIS THROAT VIGOROUSLY MANY TIMES BUT SEEMED UNABLE TO SAY MORE
6406-88089-0036 THE CHILD HAD CLIMBED ON ONE OF THE BOXES AND BROUGHT DOWN A SQUARE RED PINCUSHION FROM THE SHELF WHICH RAN ROUND THE TOP OF THE CARAVAN
6406-88089-0037 SO THAT HER MOTHER COULD SEE IT AS SHE WAS LYING IN BED IT DOES LOOK PRETTY THERE SAID THE LITTLE GIRL MAMMIE YOU CAN LOOK AT IT NICELY NOW YES MA'AM SAID THE OLD MAN AS HE PREPARED TO TAKE HIS LEAVE AND AS YOU LOOK AT IT
6406-88089-0038 HE WANTS TO FIND YOU AND TAKE YOU UP IN HIS ARMS AND CARRY YOU HOME AND HE WON'T MIND THE WOUNDS IT HAS COST HIM IF YOU'LL ONLY LET HIM DO IT GOOD DAY MA'AM SAID THE OLD MAN I SHALL MAYBE
6406-88089-0039 NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN BUT I WOULD LIKE THE GOOD SHEPHERD TO SAY THOSE WORDS OF YOU HE WENT CAREFULLY DOWN THE STEPS OF THE CARAVAN AND ROSALIE STOOD AT THE WINDOW WATCHING HIM PICKING HIS WAY TO THE OTHER SHOWS
6406-88089-0040 TO WHICH HE WAS CARRYING THE SAME MESSAGE OF PEACE SHE LOOKED OUT FROM BETWEEN THE MUSLIN CURTAINS UNTIL HE HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED TO A DISTANT PART OF THE FIELD AND THEN SHE TURNED TO HER MOTHER AND SAID EAGERLY IT'S A VERY PRETTY PICTURE
6406-88089-0041 ISN'T IT MAMMIE DEAR BUT NO ANSWER CAME FROM THE BED ROSALIE THOUGHT HER MOTHER WAS ASLEEP AND CREPT ON TIPTOE TO HER SIDE FEARFUL OF WAKING HER BUT SHE FOUND HER MOTHER'S FACE BURIED IN THE PILLOW
6406-88089-0042 ON WHICH LARGE TEARS WERE FALLING AND WHEN THE LITTLE GIRL SAT DOWN BY HER SIDE AND TRIED TO COMFORT HER BY STROKING HER HAND VERY GENTLY AND SAYING MAMMIE DEAR MAMMIE DEAR DON'T CRY WHAT'S THE MATTER MAMMIE DEAR
6406-88089-0043 HER MOTHER ONLY WEPT THE MORE AT LENGTH HER SOBS BROUGHT ON SUCH A VIOLENT FIT OF COUGHING THAT ROSALIE WAS MUCH ALARMED AND FETCHED HER A MUG OF WATER WHICH WAS STANDING ON THE SHELF NEAR THE DOOR BY DEGREES
6406-88089-0044 HER MOTHER GREW CALMER THE SOBS BECAME LESS FREQUENT AND TO THE LITTLE GIRL'S JOY SHE FELL ASLEEP ROSALIE SAT BESIDE HER WITHOUT MOVING LEST SHE SHOULD AWAKE HER AND KEPT GAZING AT HER PICTURE TILL SHE KNEW EVERY LINE OF IT
6406-88089-0045 AND THE FIRST THING HER MOTHER HEARD WHEN SHE AWOKE FROM SLEEP WAS ROSALIE'S VOICE SAYING SOFTLY REJOICE WITH ME FOR I HAVE FOUND MY SHEEP WHICH WAS LOST
