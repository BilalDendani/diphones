5333-37092-0000 GERVINUS DEVOTES THE CONCLUDING CHAPTER OF HIS SECOND VOLUME ABOUT FIFTY PAGES TO AN EXPLANATION OF THIS THE ETHICAL AUTHORITY OF THIS SUPREME TEACHER OF LIFE CONSISTS IN THE FOLLOWING
5333-37092-0001 IS THAT MAN IS GIFTED WITH POWERS OF ACTIVITY AND THEREFORE FIRST OF ALL ACCORDING TO GERVINUS SHAKESPEARE REGARDED IT AS GOOD AND NECESSARY FOR MAN THAT HE SHOULD ACT AS IF IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR A MAN NOT TO ACT
5333-37092-0002 IN OTHER WORDS HE PREFERS DEATH AND MURDER DUE TO AMBITION TO ABSTINENCE AND WISDOM ACCORDING TO GERVINUS SHAKESPEARE BELIEVES THAT HUMANITY NEED NOT SET UP IDEALS BUT THAT ONLY HEALTHY ACTIVITY AND THE GOLDEN MEAN ARE NECESSARY IN EVERYTHING INDEED
5333-37092-0003 HE ALLOWS HIMSELF TO DENY EVEN CHRISTIAN MORALITY
5333-37092-0004 EXCEED THE REASONABLE LIMITS OF GOOD IS CONVINCINGLY PROVED BY SHAKESPEARE'S WORDS AND EXAMPLES THUS EXCESSIVE GENEROSITY RUINS TIMON WHILE ANTONIO'S MODERATE GENEROSITY CONFERS HONOR
5333-37092-0005 WHEREAS IT RUINS PERCY IN WHOM IT HAS RISEN TOO HIGH EXCESSIVE VIRTUE LEADS ANGELO TO DESTRUCTION AND IF IN THOSE WHO SURROUND HIM EXCESSIVE SEVERITY BECOMES HARMFUL AND CAN NOT PREVENT CRIME ON THE OTHER HAND THE DIVINE ELEMENT IN MAN EVEN CHARITY IF IT BE EXCESSIVE
5333-37092-0006 BY SAYING THAT SHAKESPEARE DOES NOT WRITE FOR THOSE CLASSES FOR WHOM DEFINITE RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES AND LAWS ARE SUITABLE
5333-37092-0007 BUT FOR THE EDUCATED THERE ARE CLASSES OF MEN WHOSE MORALITY IS BEST GUARDED BY THE POSITIVE PRECEPTS OF RELIGION AND STATE LAW TO SUCH PERSONS SHAKESPEARE'S CREATIONS ARE INACCESSIBLE THEY ARE COMPREHENSIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE ONLY TO THE EDUCATED
5333-37092-0008 FROM WHOM ONE CAN EXPECT THAT THEY SHOULD ACQUIRE THE HEALTHY TACT OF LIFE AND SELF CONSCIOUSNESS BY MEANS OF WHICH THE INNATE GUIDING POWERS OF CONSCIENCE AND REASON UNITING WITH THE WILL LEAD US TO THE DEFINITE ATTAINMENT OF WORTHY AIMS IN LIFE
5333-37092-0009 BUT EVEN FOR SUCH EDUCATED PEOPLE SHAKESPEARE'S TEACHING IS NOT ALWAYS WITHOUT DANGER THE CONDITION ON WHICH HIS TEACHING IS QUITE HARMLESS IS THAT IT SHOULD BE ACCEPTED IN ALL ITS COMPLETENESS IN ALL ITS PARTS
5333-37092-0010 HOW COULD A MAN WHO SO ELOQUENTLY ATTRACTS PEOPLE TOWARD HONORS PERMIT THAT THE VERY ASPIRATION TOWARD THAT WHICH WAS GREAT BE CRUSHED TOGETHER WITH RANK AND DISTINCTION FOR SERVICES AND WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL DEGREES
5333-37092-0011 THE MOTIVES FOR ALL HIGH UNDERTAKINGS BE STIFLED EVEN IF THE ATTRACTION OF HONORS AND FALSE POWER TREACHEROUSLY OBTAINED WERE TO CEASE COULD THE POET ADMIT OF THE MOST DREADFUL OF ALL VIOLENCE THAT OF THE IGNORANT CROWD
5333-37092-0012 HE SAW THAT THANKS TO THIS EQUALITY NOW PREACHED EVERYTHING MAY PASS INTO VIOLENCE AND VIOLENCE INTO ARBITRARY ACTS AND THENCE INTO UNCHECKED PASSION WHICH WILL REND THE WORLD AS THE WOLF DOES ITS PREY
5333-37092-0013 FROM DECEIT AND FROM THE INJURY OF OTHERS BUT EVIL AND DECEIT ARE NOT ALWAYS VICES AND EVEN THE EVIL CAUSED TO OTHERS IS NOT NECESSARILY A VICE IT IS OFTEN MERELY A NECESSITY A LEGITIMATE WEAPON A RIGHT AND INDEED
5333-37092-0014 SHAKESPEARE ALWAYS HELD THAT THERE ARE NO UNCONDITIONAL PROHIBITIONS NOR UNCONDITIONAL DUTIES FOR INSTANCE HE DID NOT DOUBT HAMLET'S RIGHT TO KILL THE KING NOR EVEN HIS RIGHT TO STAB POLONIUS TO DEATH
5333-37092-0015 NOT TO SPEAK OF A CHARACTER DO NOT DEPEND UPON THEIR ENACTMENT OR INFRINGEMENT THE WHOLE SUBSTANCE LIES IN THE CONTENTS WITH WHICH THE SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL AT THE MOMENT OF HIS DECISION AND ON HIS OWN RESPONSIBILITY
5333-37092-0016 IN OTHER WORDS SHAKESPEARE AT LAST CLEARLY SAW THAT THE MORAL OF THE AIM IS THE ONLY TRUE AND POSSIBLE ONE SO THAT ACCORDING TO BRANDES SHAKESPEARE'S FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE FOR WHICH HE EXTOLS HIM
5333-37092-0017 IS THAT THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS ACTION AT ALL COSTS THE ABSENCE OF ALL IDEALS MODERATION IN EVERYTHING THE CONSERVATION OF THE FORMS OF LIFE ONCE ESTABLISHED AND THE END JUSTIFYING THE MEANS
5333-37092-0018 IF YOU ADD TO THIS A CHAUVINIST ENGLISH PATRIOTISM EXPRESSED IN ALL THE HISTORICAL DRAMAS
5333-37092-0019 ENGLISHMEN ALWAYS VANQUISHING THE FRENCH KILLING THOUSANDS AND LOSING ONLY SCORES JOAN OF ARC REGARDED AS A WITCH AND THE BELIEF THAT HECTOR AND ALL THE TROJANS FROM WHOM THE ENGLISH CAME ARE HEROES WHILE THE GREEKS ARE COWARDS AND TRAITORS AND SO FORTH
5333-37092-0020 SUCH IS THE VIEW OF LIFE OF THE WISEST TEACHER OF LIFE ACCORDING TO HIS GREATEST ADMIRERS AND HE WHO WILL ATTENTIVELY READ SHAKESPEARE'S WORKS CAN NOT FAIL TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS SHAKESPEARIAN VIEW OF LIFE BY HIS ADMIRERS IS QUITE CORRECT
5333-37092-0021 THE MERIT OF EVERY POETIC WORK DEPENDS ON THREE THINGS ONE THE SUBJECT OF THE WORK
5333-37092-0022 THE MORE IMPORTANT IT IS TO THE LIFE OF MANKIND THE HIGHER IS THE WORK TWO THE EXTERNAL BEAUTY ACHIEVED BY TECHNICAL METHODS PROPER TO THE PARTICULAR KIND OF ART THUS IN DRAMATIC ART
5333-37092-0023 AND DEVELOPMENT OF EMOTION AND THE FEELING OF MEASURE IN ALL THAT IS REPRESENTED THREE
5333-37092-0024 IF THE AUTHOR DOES NOT ACTUALLY FEEL WHAT HE EXPRESSES THEN THE RECIPIENT CAN NOT BECOME INFECTED WITH THE FEELING OF THE AUTHOR DOES NOT EXPERIENCE ANY FEELING AND THE PRODUCTION CAN NO LONGER BE CLASSIFIED AS A WORK OF ART
5333-37092-0025 THE SUBJECT OF SHAKESPEARE'S PIECES AS IS SEEN FROM THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF HIS GREATEST ADMIRERS IS THE LOWEST MOST VULGAR VIEW OF LIFE WHICH REGARDS THE EXTERNAL ELEVATION OF THE LORDS OF THE WORLD AS A GENUINE DISTINCTION
5333-37092-0026 REPUDIATES NOT ONLY ALL RELIGIOUS BUT ALSO ALL HUMANITARIAN STRIVINGS DIRECTED TO THE BETTERMENT OF THE EXISTING ORDER THE SECOND CONDITION ALSO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE RENDERING OF THE SCENES IN WHICH THE MOVEMENT OF FEELINGS IS EXPRESSED
5333-37092-0027 IS QUITE ABSENT IN SHAKESPEARE HE DOES NOT GRASP THE NATURAL CHARACTER OF THE POSITIONS OF HIS PERSONAGES NOR THE LANGUAGE OF THE PERSONS REPRESENTED NOR THE FEELING OF MEASURE WITHOUT WHICH NO WORK CAN BE ARTISTIC
