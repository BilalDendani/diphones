6951-79737-0000 THOUGH MILD AND GENTLE DISADVANTAGE INCONVENIENCE OR PENALTY WITH EVERY TRANSGRESSION IN THIS CHAPTER IS TO BE CONSIDERED ANOTHER MODE WHICH IS IN SOME RESPECTS THE CONVERSE OF THE FIRST
6951-79737-0001 OR AS IT MAY BE STATED SUMMARILY THE CAUTIOUS ENCOURAGEMENT OF OBEDIENCE BY REWARDS THIS METHOD OF ACTION IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN THE OTHER IN THE SENSE THAT IT REQUIRES MORE SKILL
6951-79737-0002 TACT AND DELICACY OF PERCEPTION AND DISCRIMINATION TO CARRY IT SUCCESSFULLY INTO EFFECT THE OTHER DEMANDS ONLY FIRM BUT GENTLE AND STEADY PERSISTENCE IF THE PENALTY HOWEVER SLIGHT IT MAY BE
6951-79737-0003 ALWAYS COMES THE EFFECT WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF BUT JUDICIOUSLY TO ADMINISTER A SYSTEM OF REWARDS OR EVEN OF COMMENDATIONS REQUIRES TACT DISCRIMINATION AND SKILL
6951-79737-0004 IT REQUIRES SOME OBSERVATION OF THE PECULIAR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DIFFERENT MINDS ACTED UPON AND OF THE EFFECTS PRODUCED AND OFTEN SOME INTELLIGENT MODIFICATION OF THE MEASURES IS REQUIRED
6951-79737-0005 TO FIT THEM TO VARYING CIRCUMSTANCES AND TIMES OBEDIENCE MUST NOT BE BOUGHT IF THE BESTOWING OF COMMENDATION AND REWARDS IS MADE A MATTER OF MERE BLIND ROUTINE
6951-79737-0006 AS THE ASSIGNING OF GENTLE PENALTIES MAY BE THE RESULT WILL BECOME A MERE SYSTEM OF BRIBING OR RATHER PAYING CHILDREN TO BE GOOD AND GOODNESS THAT IS BOUGHT IF IT DESERVES THE NAME OF VIRTUE AT ALL
6951-79737-0007 IS CERTAINLY VIRTUE OF A VERY INFERIOR QUALITY WHETHER A REWARD CONFERRED FOR OBEDIENCE SHALL OPERATE AS A BRIBE OR RATHER AS A PRICE PAID FOR A BRIBE STRICTLY SPEAKING IS A PRICE PAID
6951-79737-0008 NOT FOR DOING RIGHT BUT FOR DOING WRONG DEPENDS SOMETIMES ON VERY SLIGHT DIFFERENCES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PARTICULAR CASE
6951-79737-0009 A MOTHER FOR EXAMPLE GOING INTO THE VILLAGE ON A SUMMER AFTERNOON LEAVES HER CHILDREN PLAYING IN THE YARD UNDER THE GENERAL CHARGE OF SUSAN WHO IS AT WORK IN THE KITCHEN WHENCE SHE CAN OBSERVE THEM FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW
6951-79737-0010 SHE THINKS THE CHILDREN WILL BE SAFE PROVIDED THEY REMAIN IN THE YARD
6951-79737-0011 TWO DIFFERENT MODES OF MANAGEMENT UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES
6951-79737-0012 AS FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE DANGER TO WHICH THEY WOULD BE EXPOSED IN GOING INTO THE ROAD WAS VERY GREAT OR WHERE THE MOTHER CAN NOT RELY UPON HER POWER TO CONTROL HER CHILDREN'S CONDUCT BY MORAL MEANS IN ANY WAY
6951-79737-0013 THE ONLY SAFE METHOD WOULD BE TO FASTEN THE GATE BUT IF SHE PREFERS TO DEPEND FOR THEIR SAFETY ON THEIR VOLUNTARY OBEDIENCE TO HER COMMANDS AND WISHES MOREOVER TO PROMOTE THE SPIRIT OF OBEDIENCE BY REWARDING
6951-79737-0014 RATHER THAN PUNISHING SHE CAN MAKE HER REWARDS OF THE NATURE OF HIRE OR NOT ACCORDING TO HER MODE OF MANAGEMENT
6951-79737-0015 IF SHE WISHES TO HIRE OBEDIENCE SHE HAS ONLY TO SAY TO THE CHILDREN THAT SHE IS GOING INTO THE VILLAGE FOR A LITTLE TIME AND THAT THEY MAY PLAY IN THE YARD WHILE SHE IS GONE BUT MUST NOT GO OUT OF THE GATE
6951-79737-0016 ADDING THAT SHE IS GOING TO BRING HOME SOME ORANGES OR CANDIES WHICH SHE WILL GIVE THEM IF SHE FINDS THAT THEY HAVE OBEYED HER BUT WHICH SHE WILL NOT GIVE THEM IF THEY HAVE DISOBEYED SUCH A PROMISE
6951-79737-0017 NAMELY FIRST A FULL BELIEF THAT SHE WILL REALLY BRING HOME THE PROMISED REWARDS IF THEY OBEY HER AND SECONDLY
6951-79737-0018 AND THIS IS A CONFIDENCE MUCH LESS FREQUENTLY FELT BY CHILDREN AND MUCH LESS FREQUENTLY DESERVED BY THEIR MOTHERS A CONVICTION THAT IN CASE THEY DISOBEY NO IMPORTUNITIES ON THEIR PART OR PROMISES FOR THE NEXT TIME WILL INDUCE THEIR MOTHER TO GIVE THEM THE GOOD THINGS BUT THAT THE REWARDS WILL CERTAINLY BE LOST TO THEM
6951-79737-0019 UNLESS THEY ARE DESERVED ACCORDING TO THE CONDITIONS OF THE PROMISE IN SUCH A CASE THAT IS WHEN THIS DOUBLE CONFIDENCE EXISTS THE PROMISE WILL HAVE GREAT INFLUENCE UPON THE CHILDREN STILL IT IS
6951-79737-0020 IN ITS NATURE HIRING THEM TO OBEY I DO NOT SAY THAT THIS IS NECESSARILY A BAD PLAN
6951-79737-0021 CHILDREN MAY PERHAPS BE TRAINED GRADUALLY TO HABITS OF OBEDIENCE BY A SYSTEM OF DIRECT REWARDS AND IN A MANNER TOO FAR MORE AGREEABLE TO THE PARENT AND BETTER FOR THE CHILD THAN BY A SYSTEM OF COMPULSION
6951-79737-0022 THROUGH THREATS AND PUNISHMENT THE METHOD OF INDIRECT REWARDING
6951-79737-0023 TO PARENTAL AUTHORITY IN THE MINDS OF CHILDREN AS A MEANS OF ALLURING THEM TO THE HABIT OF OBEDIENCE
6951-79737-0024 SUPPOSE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CASE ABOVE DESCRIBED THE MOTHER ON LEAVING THE CHILDREN SIMPLY GIVES THEM THE COMMAND THAT THEY ARE NOT TO LEAVE THE YARD BUT MAKES NO PROMISES AND THEN ON RETURNING FROM THE VILLAGE WITH THE BONBONS IN HER BAG
6951-79737-0025 SIMPLY ASKS SUSAN WHEN SHE COMES IN WHETHER THE CHILDREN HAVE OBEYED HER INJUNCTION NOT TO LEAVE THE YARD IF SUSAN SAYS YES SHE NODS TO THEM WITH A LOOK OF SATISFACTION AND PLEASURE
6951-79737-0026 AND ADDS I THOUGHT THEY WOULD OBEY ME I AM VERY GLAD NOW I CAN TRUST THEM AGAIN THEN BY AND BY TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE DAY PERHAPS AND WHEN THE CHILDREN SUPPOSE THAT THE AFFAIR IS FORGOTTEN
6951-79737-0027 SHE TAKES AN OPPORTUNITY TO CALL THEM TO HER SAYING THAT SHE HAS SOMETHING TO TELL THEM YOU REMEMBER WHEN I WENT TO THE VILLAGE TO DAY I LEFT YOU IN THE YARD AND SAID THAT YOU MUST NOT GO OUT OF THE GATE AND YOU OBEYED
6951-79737-0028 PERHAPS YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GO OUT INTO THE ROAD AND PLAY THERE BUT YOU WOULD NOT GO BECAUSE I HAD FORBIDDEN IT I AM VERY GLAD THAT YOU OBEYED I THOUGHT OF YOU WHEN I WAS IN THE VILLAGE AND I THOUGHT YOU WOULD OBEY ME I FELT QUITE SAFE ABOUT YOU
6951-79737-0029 I SHOULD HAVE FELT UNEASY AND ANXIOUS BUT I FELT SAFE
6951-79737-0030 IT MAY PERHAPS BE SAID BY THE READER THAT THIS IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS GIVING A DIRECT REWARD FOR THE OBEDIENCE I ADMIT THAT IT IS IN SOME SENSE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME THING
6951-79737-0031 BUT IT IS NOT THE SAME IN FORM AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CASES WHERE THE EFFECT IS MODIFIED VERY GREATLY BY THE FORM WHERE CHILDREN ARE DIRECTLY PROMISED A REWARD IF THEY DO SO AND SO
6951-79737-0032 THEY NATURALLY REGARD THE TRANSACTION AS OF THE NATURE OF A CONTRACT OR A BARGAIN SUCH THAT WHEN THEY HAVE FULFILLED THE CONDITIONS ON THEIR PART THE REWARD IS THEIR DUE
6951-79737-0033 AND THEY COME AND DEMAND IT AS SUCH
6951-79737-0034 THE TENDENCY THEN IS TO DIVEST THEIR MINDS OF ALL SENSE OF OBLIGATION IN RESPECT TO DOING RIGHT AND TO MAKE THEM FEEL THAT IT IS IN SOME SENSE OPTIONAL WITH THEM WHETHER TO DO RIGHT AND EARN THE REWARD OR NOT
6951-79737-0035 TO DO RIGHT AND LOSE IT IN THE CASE HOWEVER LAST DESCRIBED WHICH SEEMS AT FIRST VIEW TO DIFFER ONLY IN FORM FROM THE PRECEDING ONE THE COMMENDATION AND THE BONBONS WOULD BE SO CONNECTED WITH THE ACT OF OBEDIENCE AS TO ASSOCIATE VERY AGREEABLE IDEAS WITH IT IN THE CHILDREN'S MINDS
6951-79737-0036 AND THUS TO MAKE DOING RIGHT APPEAR ATTRACTIVE TO THEM ON FUTURE OCCASIONS
6951-79737-0037 WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THEY WOULD NOT IN ANY DEGREE DEPRIVE THE ACT ITSELF OF ITS SPONTANEOUS CHARACTER AS RESULTING FROM A SENSE OF DUTY ON THEIR PART OR PRODUCE THE IMPRESSION ON THEIR MINDS THAT THEIR REMAINING WITHIN THE GATE WAS OF THE NATURE OF A SERVICE RENDERED TO THEIR MOTHER FOR HIRE AND AFTERWARDS DULY PAID FOR
6951-79737-0038 THE LESSON WHICH WE DEDUCE FROM THIS ILLUSTRATION AND THE CONSIDERATIONS CONNECTED WITH IT MAY BE STATED AS FOLLOWS THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE
6951-79737-0039 WHEN YOU ARE AT PLAY AND HAVING A VERY PLEASANT TIME I KNOW VERY WELL THAT IT IS HARD FOR YOU TO BE CALLED AWAY TO PUZZLE OVER YOUR LETTERS AND YOUR READING IT WAS VERY HARD FOR ME WHEN I WAS A CHILD
6951-79737-0040 IT IS VERY HARD FOR ALL CHILDREN BUT THEN IT MUST BE DONE THE WAY IN THIS
6951-79737-0041 NOT TO ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE OR PERSUADE THE CHILD BUT TO PUT THE PERFORMANCE OF THEM SIMPLY ON THE GROUND OF SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITY
6951-79737-0042 THE CHILD MUST LEAVE HIS PLAY AND COME TO TAKE HIS LESSON NOT BECAUSE HE SEES THAT IT IS BETTER FOR HIM TO LEARN TO READ THAN TO PLAY ALL THE TIME
6951-79737-0043 OR A LUMP OF SUGAR OR BESTOW UPON HIM ANY OTHER LITTLE GRATIFICATION IT IS BETTER NOT TO PROMISE THESE THINGS BEFOREHAND SO AS TO GIVE TO THE COMING OF THE CHILD WHEN CALLED THE CHARACTER OF A SERVICE RENDERED FOR HIRE LET HIM COME SIMPLY BECAUSE HE IS CALLED AND THEN LET THE GRATIFICATIONS BE BESTOWED AS THE EXPRESSIONS OF HIS MOTHER'S SATISFACTION AND HAPPINESS IN VIEW OF HER BOY'S READY
6951-79737-0044 OBEDIENCE TO HER COMMANDS AND FAITHFUL PERFORMANCE OF HIS DUTY OBEDIENCE THOUGH IMPLICIT NEED NOT BE BLIND
6951-79737-0045 BECAUSE A MOTHER IS NOT TO RELY UPON THE REASON AND FORECAST OF THE CHILD IN RESPECT TO FUTURE ADVANTAGES TO ACCRUE FROM EFFORTS OR SACRIFICES AS MOTIVES OF PRESENT ACTION
6951-79737-0046 THAT SHE IS NOT TO EMPLOY THE INFLUENCE OF THESE MOTIVES AT ALL IT IS TRUE THAT THOSE FACULTIES OF THE MIND BY WHICH WE APPREHEND DISTANT THINGS AND GOVERN OUR CONDUCT BY THEM ARE NOT YET DEVELOPED IN THE CHILD
6951-79737-0047 AND THE AID OF THE PARENT WILL BE OF THE GREATEST SERVICE IN PROMOTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEM
6951-79737-0048 AT PROPER TIMES THEN THE PLEASURES AND ADVANTAGES OF KNOWING HOW TO READ SHOULD BE DESCRIBED TO THE CHILD AND PRESENTED MOREOVER IN THE MOST ATTRACTIVE FORM THE PROPER TIME FOR DOING THIS WOULD BE WHEN NO LESSON IS IN QUESTION
6951-79737-0049 DURING A RIDE OR A WALK OR IN THE MIDST OF A STORY OR WHILE LOOKING AT A BOOK OF PICTURES A MOST IMPROPER TIME WOULD BE WHEN A COMMAND HAD BEEN GIVEN AND WAS DISREGARDED
6951-79737-0050 AS A PLANT BY BEING LONG HELD UP BY A STAKE COMES IN THE END NOT TO BE ABLE TO STAND ALONE SO A MOTHER CAN NOT IN ANY WAY MORE EFFECTUALLY UNDERMINE HER AUTHORITY AS AUTHORITY
6951-79737-0051 THAN BY ATTEMPTING TO EKE OUT ITS FORCE BY ARGUMENTS AND COAXINGS AUTHORITY NOT TO BE MADE OPPRESSIVE WHILE THE PARENT
6951-79737-0052 MUST THUS TAKE CARE TO ESTABLISH THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTHORITY AS THE GROUND OF OBEDIENCE ON THE PART OF HIS CHILDREN AND MUST NOT MAKE THEIR DOING WHAT HE REQUIRES
6951-79737-0053 ANY THE LESS ACTS OF OBEDIENCE THROUGH VAINLY ATTEMPTING TO DIMINISH THE HARDSHIP OF OBEYING A COMMAND BY MINGLING THE INFLUENCE OF REASONINGS AND PERSUASIONS WITH IT
6951-79737-0054 HE MAY IN OTHER WAYS DO ALL IN HIS POWER AND THAT WILL BE A GREAT DEAL TO MAKE THE ACTS OF OBEDIENCE EASY OR
6951-79737-0055 ONE MODE BY WHICH THIS MAY BE DONE IS BY NOT SPRINGING DISAGREEABLE OBLIGATIONS UPON A CHILD SUDDENLY BUT
6951-79737-0056 BY GIVING HIS MIND A LITTLE TIME TO FORM ITSELF TO THE IDEA OF WHAT IS TO COME WHEN JOHNNY AND MARY ARE PLAYING TOGETHER HAPPILY WITH THEIR BLOCKS UPON THE FLOOR AND ARE PERHAPS JUST COMPLETING A TOWER WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN BUILDING
6951-79737-0057 IF THEIR MOTHER COMES SUDDENLY INTO THE ROOM ANNOUNCES TO THEM ABRUPTLY THAT IT IS TIME FOR THEM TO GO TO BED THROWS DOWN THE TOWER AND BRUSHES THE BLOCKS INTO THE BASKET AND THEN HURRIES THE CHILDREN AWAY TO THE UNDRESSING
6951-79737-0058 SHE GIVES A SUDDEN AND PAINFUL SHOCK TO THEIR WHOLE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND GREATLY INCREASES THE DISAPPOINTMENT AND PAIN WHICH THEY EXPERIENCE IN BEING OBLIGED TO GIVE UP THEIR PLAY
6951-79737-0059 THE DELAY OF A SINGLE MINUTE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO BRING THEIR MINDS ROUND EASILY AND GENTLY INTO SUBMISSION TO THE NECESSITY OF THE CASE IF SHE COMES TO THEM WITH A SMILE
6951-79737-0060 AND PLEASURE UPON HER COUNTENANCE AND THEN SAYS IT IS BED TIME CHILDREN BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU FINISH YOUR TOWER ONE MINUTE OF DELAY LIKE THIS TO SOFTEN THE SUDDENNESS OF THE TRANSITION
6951-79737-0061 WILL MAKE THE ACT OF SUBMISSION TO THE NECESSITY OF GIVING UP PLAY AND GOING TO BED IN OBEDIENCE TO THE MOTHER'S COMMAND
6951-79737-0062 AS IT VERY LIKELY WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY VEXATIOUS AND PAINFUL GIVE A LITTLE TIME IN THE SAME WAY
6951-79737-0063 IF THE LADY OF THE HOUSE COMES A LITTLE BEFORE THE TIME AND SAYS TO THEM THAT AFTER ONE MORE PLAY OR TWO MORE PLAYS AS THE CASE MAY BE THE PARTY MUST COME TO AN END THE CLOSING OF IT WOULD BE MADE EASY
6951-79737-0064 WHILE BY WAITING TILL THE HOUR HAD COME AND THEN SUDDENLY INTERRUPTING THE GAYETY PERHAPS IN THE MIDDLE OF A GAME BY THE ABRUPT ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE CHILDREN THAT THE CLOCK HAS STRUCK AND THEY MUST STOP THEIR PLAYS AND BEGIN TO GET READY TO GO HOME
6951-79737-0065 SHE BRINGS UPON THEM A SUDDEN SHOCK OF PAINFUL SURPRISE DISAPPOINTMENT AND PERHAPS IRRITATION SO
6951-79737-0066 IF CHILDREN ARE TO BE CALLED AWAY FROM THEIR PLAY FOR ANY PURPOSE WHATEVER IT IS ALWAYS BEST TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE NOTICE IF IT BE ONLY A MOMENT'S NOTICE BEFOREHAND JOHN
6951-79737-0067 IN A MINUTE OR TWO I SHALL WISH YOU TO GO AND GET SOME WOOD YOU CAN BE GETTING YOUR THINGS READY TO BE LEFT MARY IT IS ALMOST TIME FOR YOUR LESSON
6951-79737-0068 ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE
6951-79737-0069 AND ARE TO BE RECALLED BY A BELL OBEDIENCE TO THE CALL WILL BE MADE MUCH MORE EASY TO THEM BY A PRELIMINARY SIGNAL AS A WARNING GIVEN FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE TIME
6951-79737-0070 OF COURSE IT WILL NOT ALWAYS BE CONVENIENT TO GIVE THESE SIGNALS AND THESE TIMES OF PREPARATION NOR WILL IT BE ALWAYS NECESSARY TO GIVE THEM
6951-79737-0071 TO DETERMINE HOW AND IN WHAT CASES IT IS BEST TO APPLY THE PRINCIPLE HERE EXPLAINED WILL REQUIRE SOME TACT AND GOOD JUDGMENT ON THE PART OF THE PARENT
6951-79737-0072 ALL THAT IS DESIRABLE IS THAT THE MOTHER SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLE AND THAT SHE SHOULD APPLY IT AS FAR AS SHE CONVENIENTLY AND EASILY CAN DO SO SHE WILL FIND IN PRACTICE THAT WHEN SHE ONCE APPRECIATES THE VALUE OF IT
6951-79737-0073 AND OBSERVES ITS KIND AND BENEFICENT WORKING SHE WILL FIND IT CONVENIENT AND EASY TO APPLY IT FAR MORE GENERALLY THAN SHE WOULD SUPPOSE NO WEAKENING OF AUTHORITY IN THIS
6951-79737-0074 IT IS VERY PLAIN THAT SOFTENING THUS THE HARDSHIP FOR THE CHILD OF ANY ACT OF OBEDIENCE REQUIRED OF HIM BY GIVING HIM A LITTLE TIME IMPLIES NO ABATEMENT OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE PARENT NOR DOES IT
6951-79737-0075 DETRACT AT ALL FROM THE IMPLICITNESS OF THE OBEDIENCE ON THE PART OF THE CHILD THE SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITY IS AS COMPLETE IN DOING A THING IN FIVE MINUTES IF THE ORDER WAS TO DO IT IN FIVE MINUTES
6951-79737-0076 AS IN DOING IT AT ONCE IF THE ORDER WAS TO DO IT AT ONCE
6951-79737-0077 WHEN THUS TRYING TO MAKE OBEDIENCE MORE EASY BY ALLOWING TIME THAT IT SHOULD BE PROMPT AND ABSOLUTE WHEN THE TIME HAS EXPIRED THE IDEA IS THAT THOUGH THE PARENT IS BOUND FULLY TO MAINTAIN HIS AUTHORITY OVER HIS CHILDREN
6951-79737-0078 IN ALL ITS FORCE HE IS ALSO BOUND TO MAKE THE EXERCISE OF IT
6951-79737-0079 ALL IN HIS POWER TO MAKE THE YOKE OF OBEDIENCE LIGHT AND EASILY TO BE BORNE INFLUENCE ON THE HEALTHFUL DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN INDEED BESIDES THE BEARING OF THESE VIEWS ON THE HAPPINESS OF THE CHILDREN
6951-79737-0080 IT IS NOT AT ALL IMPROBABLE THAT THE QUESTION OF HEALTH MAY BE SERIOUSLY INVOLVED IN THEM FOR
6951-79737-0081 IT IS A PERFECTLY WELL ESTABLISHED FACT THAT ALL ITS OPERATIONS AND FUNCTIONS AS AN ANIMATING SPIRIT IN THE HUMAN BODY ARE FULFILLED THROUGH THE WORKINGS OF MATERIAL ORGANS IN THE BRAIN
6951-79737-0082 TENDER AND DELICATE CONDITION AND THAT ALL SUDDEN SHARP AND ESPECIALLY PAINFUL EMOTIONS GREATLY EXCITE AND SOMETIMES CRUELLY IRRITATE THEM
6951-79737-0083 IS OFTEN INTERFERED WITH BY MENTAL ANXIETY OR DISTRESS HOW FREQUENTLY IN PERSONS SUBJECT TO HEADACHES THE PAROXYSM IS BROUGHT ON BY WORRYINGS OR PERPLEXITIES ENDURED INCIDENTALLY ON THE PRECEDING DAY
6951-79737-0084 AND ESPECIALLY HOW OFTEN VIOLENT AND PAINFUL EMOTIONS WHEN THEY ARE EXTREME RESULT IN DECIDED AND SOMETIMES IN PERMANENT AND HOPELESS INSANITY THAT IS
6951-79737-0085 IN AN IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO SOME DELICATE MECHANISM IN THE BRAIN WE SHALL SEE THAT THERE IS EVERY REASON FOR SUPPOSING THAT ALL SUDDEN SHOCKS TO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF CHILDREN
6951-79737-0086 ALL VIOLENT AND PAINFUL EXCITEMENTS ALL VEXATIONS AND IRRITATIONS AND EBULLITIONS OF ILL TEMPER AND ANGER HAVE A TENDENCY TO DISTURB THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF THE CEREBRAL ORGANS
6951-79737-0087 IN MANY CASES SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE FUTURE HEALTH AND WELFARE AS WELL AS THE PRESENT HAPPINESS OF THE CHILD IT IS TRUE THAT MENTAL DISTURBANCES AND AGITATIONS OF THIS KIND CAN NOT BE WHOLLY AVOIDED
6951-79737-0088 BUT THEY SHOULD BE AVOIDED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND THE MOST EFFICIENT MEANS FOR AVOIDING THEM IS A FIRM THOUGH CALM AND GENTLE ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF PARENTAL AUTHORITY
6951-79737-0089 AND NOT AS MANY MOTHERS VERY MISTAKINGLY IMAGINE
6951-79737-0090 BY UNREASONABLE INDULGENCES AND BY ENDEAVORS TO MANAGE THEIR CHILDREN BY PERSUASIONS BRIBINGS AND MANOEUVRINGS INSTEAD OF BY COMMANDS THE MOST INDULGED CHILDREN AND THE LEAST GOVERNED
6951-79737-0091 ARE ALWAYS THE MOST PETULANT AND IRRITABLE WHILE A STRONG GOVERNMENT IF REGULAR UNIFORM AND JUST AND IF ADMINISTERED BY GENTLE MEASURES
6951-79737-0092 OF CALMNESS AND PEACE IN A WORD WHILE THE MOTHER IS BOUND TO DO ALL IN HER POWER TO RENDER SUBMISSION TO HER AUTHORITY EASY AND AGREEABLE TO HER CHILDREN
