726-124445-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL
726-124445-0001 EVENING I FOUND THOMAS SNELLING IN HIS HOUSE AT BETHNAL GREEN BUT UNHAPPILY HE WAS NOT IN A CONDITION TO REMEMBER ANYTHING
726-124445-0002 THE VERY PROSPECT OF BEER WHICH MY EXPECTED COMING HAD OPENED TO HIM HAD PROVED TOO MUCH
726-124445-0003 I LEARNED HOWEVER FROM HIS WIFE WHO SEEMED A DECENT POOR SOUL THAT HE WAS ONLY THE ASSISTANT TO SMOLLET WHO OF THE TWO MATES WAS THE RESPONSIBLE PERSON SO OFF I DROVE TO WALWORTH
726-124445-0004 AND FOUND MISTER JOSEPH SMOLLET AT HOME AND IN HIS SHIRTSLEEVES TAKING A LATE TEA OUT OF A SAUCER HE IS A DECENT INTELLIGENT FELLOW DISTINCTLY A GOOD RELIABLE TYPE OF WORKMAN AND WITH A HEADPIECE OF HIS OWN
726-124445-0005 HE REMEMBERED ALL ABOUT THE INCIDENT OF THE BOXES AND FROM A WONDERFUL DOG'S EARED NOTEBOOK WHICH HE PRODUCED FROM SOME MYSTERIOUS RECEPTACLE ABOUT THE SEAT OF HIS TROUSERS AND WHICH HAD HIEROGLYPHICAL ENTRIES IN THICK HALF OBLITERATED PENCIL
726-124445-0006 HE GAVE ME THE DESTINATIONS OF THE BOXES
726-124445-0007 AND ANOTHER SIX WHICH HE DEPOSITED AT JAMAICA LANE BERMONDSEY IF THEN THE COUNT MEANT TO SCATTER THESE GHASTLY REFUGES OF HIS OVER LONDON THESE PLACES WERE CHOSEN AS THE FIRST OF DELIVERY
726-124445-0008 SO THAT LATER HE MIGHT DISTRIBUTE MORE FULLY THE SYSTEMATIC MANNER IN WHICH THIS WAS DONE MADE ME THINK THAT HE COULD NOT MEAN TO CONFINE HIMSELF TO TWO SIDES OF LONDON HE WAS NOW FIXED ON THE FAR EAST OF THE NORTHERN SHORE ON THE EAST OF THE SOUTHERN SHORE
726-124445-0009 AND ON THE SOUTH THE NORTH AND WEST WERE SURELY NEVER MEANT TO BE LEFT OUT OF HIS DIABOLICAL SCHEME LET ALONE THE CITY ITSELF AND THE VERY HEART OF FASHIONABLE LONDON IN THE SOUTH WEST AND WEST
726-124445-0010 THERE AIN'T A MANY SUCH JOBS AS THIS ERE AN I'M THINKIN THAT MAYBE SAM BLOXAM COULD TELL YE SUMMUT I ASKED IF HE COULD TELL ME WHERE TO FIND HIM I TOLD HIM THAT IF HE COULD GET ME THE ADDRESS IT WOULD BE WORTH ANOTHER HALF SOVEREIGN TO HIM
726-124445-0011 SO HE GULPED DOWN THE REST OF HIS TEA AND STOOD UP SAYING THAT HE WAS GOING TO BEGIN THE SEARCH THEN AND THERE AT THE DOOR HE STOPPED AND SAID LOOK ERE GUV'NOR THERE AIN'T NO SENSE IN ME A KEEPIN YOU ERE I MAY FIND SAM SOON OR I MAYN'T
726-124445-0012 BUT ANYHOW HE AIN'T LIKE TO BE IN A WAY TO TELL YE MUCH TO NIGHT SAM IS A RARE ONE WHEN HE STARTS ON THE BOOZE IF YOU CAN GIVE ME A ENVELOPE WITH A STAMP ON IT
726-124445-0013 WHEN SHE CAME BACK I ADDRESSED THE ENVELOPE AND STAMPED IT AND WHEN SMOLLET HAD AGAIN FAITHFULLY PROMISED TO POST THE ADDRESS WHEN FOUND I TOOK MY WAY TO HOME WE'RE ON THE TRACK ANYHOW I AM TIRED TO NIGHT
726-124445-0014 MINA IS FAST ASLEEP AND LOOKS A LITTLE TOO PALE HER EYES LOOK AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN CRYING POOR DEAR I'VE NO DOUBT IT FRETS HER TO BE KEPT IN THE DARK AND IT MAY MAKE HER DOUBLY ANXIOUS ABOUT ME AND THE OTHERS
726-124445-0015 BUT IT IS BEST AS IT IS IT IS BETTER TO BE DISAPPOINTED AND WORRIED IN SUCH A WAY NOW THAN TO HAVE HER NERVE BROKEN THE DOCTORS WERE QUITE RIGHT TO INSIST ON HER BEING KEPT OUT OF THIS DREADFUL BUSINESS
726-124445-0016 I MUST BE FIRM FOR ON ME THIS PARTICULAR BURDEN OF SILENCE MUST REST I SHALL NOT EVER ENTER ON THE SUBJECT WITH HER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES INDEED IT MAY NOT BE A HARD TASK AFTER ALL
726-124445-0017 FOR SHE HERSELF HAS BECOME RETICENT ON THE SUBJECT AND HAS NOT SPOKEN OF THE COUNT OR HIS DOINGS EVER SINCE WE TOLD HER OF OUR DECISION
726-124445-0018 EVENING A LONG AND TRYING AND EXCITING DAY BY THE FIRST POST I GOT MY DIRECTED ENVELOPE WITH A DIRTY SCRAP OF PAPER ENCLOSED ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN WITH A CARPENTER'S PENCIL IN A SPRAWLING HAND SAM BLOXAM
726-124445-0019 KORKRANS FOUR POTERS CORT BARTEL STREET WALWORTH ARSK FOR THE DEPITE I GOT THE LETTER IN BED AND ROSE WITHOUT WAKING MINA SHE LOOKED HEAVY AND SLEEPY AND PALE AND FAR FROM WELL
726-124445-0020 I DETERMINED NOT TO WAKE HER BUT THAT WHEN I SHOULD RETURN FROM THIS NEW SEARCH I WOULD ARRANGE FOR HER GOING BACK TO EXETER I THINK SHE WOULD BE HAPPIER IN OUR OWN HOME WITH HER DAILY TASKS TO INTEREST HER
726-124445-0021 THAN IN BEING HERE AMONGST US AND IN IGNORANCE I ONLY SAW DOCTOR SEWARD FOR A MOMENT AND TOLD HIM WHERE I WAS OFF TO PROMISING TO COME BACK AND TELL THE REST SO SOON AS I SHOULD HAVE FOUND OUT ANYTHING
726-124445-0022 I DROVE TO WALWORTH AND FOUND WITH SOME DIFFICULTY POTTER'S COURT MISTER SMOLLET'S SPELLING MISLED ME AS I ASKED FOR POTER'S COURT INSTEAD OF POTTER'S COURT HOWEVER
726-124445-0023 WHEN I HAD FOUND THE COURT I HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN DISCOVERING CORCORAN'S LODGING HOUSE WHEN I ASKED THE MAN WHO CAME TO THE DOOR FOR THE DEPITE HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID I DUNNO IM THERE AIN'T NO SUCH A PERSON ERE
726-124445-0024 I NEVER EARD OF IM IN ALL MY BLOOMIN DAYS DON'T BELIEVE THERE AIN'T NOBODY OF THAT KIND LIVIN ERE OR ANYWHERES I TOOK OUT SMOLLET'S LETTER AND AS I READ IT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE LESSON OF THE SPELLING OF THE NAME OF THE COURT MIGHT GUIDE ME WHAT ARE YOU
726-124445-0025 I ASKED I'M THE DEPITY HE ANSWERED I SAW AT ONCE THAT I WAS ON THE RIGHT TRACK PHONETIC SPELLING HAD AGAIN MISLED ME A HALF CROWN TIP PUT THE DEPUTY'S KNOWLEDGE AT MY DISPOSAL AND I LEARNED THAT MISTER BLOXAM
726-124445-0026 WHO HAD SLEPT OFF THE REMAINS OF HIS BEER ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AT CORCORAN'S HAD LEFT FOR HIS WORK AT POPLAR AT FIVE O'CLOCK THAT MORNING HE COULD NOT TELL ME WHERE THE PLACE OF WORK WAS SITUATED BUT HE HAD A VAGUE IDEA THAT IT WAS SOME KIND OF A NEW FANGLED WARE'US
726-124445-0027 AND WITH THIS SLENDER CLUE I HAD TO START FOR POPLAR IT WAS TWELVE O'CLOCK BEFORE I GOT ANY SATISFACTORY HINT OF SUCH A BUILDING AND THIS I GOT AT A COFFEE SHOP WHERE SOME WORKMEN WERE HAVING THEIR DINNER
726-124445-0028 A NEW COLD STORAGE BUILDING AND AS THIS SUITED THE CONDITION OF A NEW FANGLED WARE'US I AT ONCE DROVE TO IT AN INTERVIEW WITH A SURLY GATEKEEPER AND A SURLIER FOREMAN
726-124445-0029 BOTH OF WHOM WERE APPEASED WITH THE COIN OF THE REALM PUT ME ON THE TRACK OF BLOXAM HE WAS SENT FOR ON MY SUGGESTING THAT I WAS WILLING TO PAY HIS DAY'S WAGES TO HIS FOREMAN FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF ASKING HIM A FEW QUESTIONS ON A PRIVATE MATTER
726-124445-0030 HE WAS A SMART ENOUGH FELLOW THOUGH ROUGH OF SPEECH AND BEARING WHEN I HAD PROMISED TO PAY FOR HIS INFORMATION AND GIVEN HIM AN EARNEST HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD MADE TWO JOURNEYS BETWEEN CARFAX AND A HOUSE IN PICCADILLY AND HAD TAKEN FROM THIS HOUSE TO THE LATTER
726-124445-0031 OR SOMETHINK OF THE KIND NOT LONG BUILT IT WAS A DUSTY OLD OUSE TOO THOUGH NOTHIN TO THE DUSTINESS OF THE OUSE WE TOOKED THE BLOOMIN BOXES FROM
726-124445-0032 THERE WAS THE OLD PARTY WHAT ENGAGED ME A WAITIN IN THE OUSE AT PURFLEET HE ELPED ME TO LIFT THE BOXES AND PUT THEM IN THE DRAY CURSE ME BUT HE WAS THE STRONGEST CHAP I EVER STRUCK
726-124445-0033 HOW THIS PHRASE THRILLED THROUGH ME WHY E TOOK UP IS END O THE BOXES LIKE THEY WAS POUNDS OF TEA AND ME A PUFFIN AN A BLOWIN AFORE I COULD UP END MINE ANYHOW AN I'M NO CHICKEN NEITHER
726-124445-0034 HOW DID YOU GET INTO THE HOUSE IN PICCADILLY I ASKED HE WAS THERE TOO
726-124445-0035 THE WHOLE NINE I ASKED
726-124445-0036 THERE WAS FIVE IN THE FIRST LOAD AN FOUR IN THE SECOND IT WAS MAIN DRY WORK AN I DON'T SO WELL REMEMBER OW I GOT OME I INTERRUPTED HIM WERE THE BOXES LEFT IN THE HALL
726-124445-0037 I MADE ONE MORE ATTEMPT TO FURTHER MATTERS YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY KEY NEVER USED NO KEY NOR NOTHINK THE OLD GENT HE OPENED THE DOOR ISSELF AN SHUT IT AGAIN WHEN I DRUV OFF I DON'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME BUT THAT WAS THE BEER
726-124445-0038 AND YOU CAN'T REMEMBER THE NUMBER OF THE HOUSE NO SIR BUT YE NEEDN'T HAVE NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT THAT IT'S A IGH UN WITH A STONE FRONT WITH A BOW ON IT AN IGH STEPS UP TO THE DOOR
726-124445-0039 THE OLD GENT GIVE THEM SHILLIN'S AN THEY SEEIN THEY GOT SO MUCH THEY WANTED MORE BUT E TOOK ONE OF THEM BY THE SHOULDER AND WAS LIKE TO THROW IM DOWN THE STEPS TILL THE LOT OF THEM WENT AWAY CUSSIN I THOUGHT THAT WITH THIS DESCRIPTION I COULD FIND THE HOUSE
726-124445-0040 I HAD GAINED A NEW PAINFUL EXPERIENCE THE COUNT COULD IT WAS EVIDENT HANDLE THE EARTH BOXES HIMSELF IF SO TIME WAS PRECIOUS FOR NOW THAT HE HAD ACHIEVED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DISTRIBUTION HE COULD BY CHOOSING HIS OWN TIME
726-124445-0041 COMPLETE THE TASK UNOBSERVED AT PICCADILLY CIRCUS I DISCHARGED MY CAB AND WALKED WESTWARD BEYOND THE JUNIOR CONSTITUTIONAL I CAME ACROSS THE HOUSE DESCRIBED AND WAS SATISFIED THAT THIS WAS THE NEXT OF THE LAIRS ARRANGED BY DRACULA
726-124445-0042 THE HOUSE LOOKED AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN LONG UNTENANTED THE WINDOWS WERE ENCRUSTED WITH DUST AND THE SHUTTERS WERE UP ALL THE FRAMEWORK WAS BLACK WITH TIME AND FROM THE IRON THE PAINT HAD MOSTLY SCALED AWAY
726-124445-0043 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT UP TO LATELY THERE HAD BEEN A LARGE NOTICE BOARD IN FRONT OF THE BALCONY IT HAD HOWEVER BEEN ROUGHLY TORN AWAY THE UPRIGHTS WHICH HAD SUPPORTED IT STILL REMAINING
726-124445-0044 AS IT WOULD PERHAPS HAVE GIVEN SOME CLUE TO THE OWNERSHIP OF THE HOUSE I REMEMBERED MY EXPERIENCE OF THE INVESTIGATION AND PURCHASE OF CARFAX
726-124445-0045 AND I COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT IF I COULD FIND THE FORMER OWNER THERE MIGHT BE SOME MEANS DISCOVERED OF GAINING ACCESS TO THE HOUSE THERE WAS AT PRESENT NOTHING TO BE LEARNED FROM THE PICCADILLY SIDE AND NOTHING COULD BE DONE
726-124445-0046 THE MEWS WERE ACTIVE THE PICCADILLY HOUSES BEING MOSTLY IN OCCUPATION I ASKED ONE OR TWO OF THE GROOMS AND HELPERS WHOM I SAW AROUND IF THEY COULD TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT THE EMPTY HOUSE ONE OF THEM SAID THAT HE HEARD IT HAD LATELY BEEN TAKEN
726-124445-0047 BUT HE COULDN'T SAY FROM WHOM HE TOLD ME HOWEVER THAT UP TO VERY LATELY THERE HAD BEEN A NOTICE BOARD OF FOR SALE UP AND THAT PERHAPS MITCHELL SONS AND CANDY THE HOUSE AGENTS COULD TELL ME SOMETHING
726-124445-0048 AS HE THOUGHT HE REMEMBERED SEEING THE NAME OF THAT FIRM ON THE BOARD I DID NOT WISH TO SEEM TOO EAGER OR TO LET MY INFORMANT KNOW OR GUESS TOO MUCH SO THANKING HIM IN THE USUAL MANNER I STROLLED AWAY IT WAS NOW GROWING DUSK
726-124445-0049 AND THE AUTUMN NIGHT WAS CLOSING IN SO I DID NOT LOSE ANY TIME HAVING LEARNED THE ADDRESS OF MITCHELL SONS AND CANDY FROM A DIRECTORY AT THE BERKELEY I WAS SOON AT THEIR OFFICE IN SACKVILLE STREET THE GENTLEMAN WHO SAW ME WAS PARTICULARLY SUAVE IN MANNER
726-124445-0050 BUT UNCOMMUNICATIVE IN EQUAL PROPORTION HAVING ONCE TOLD ME THAT THE PICCADILLY HOUSE WHICH THROUGHOUT OUR INTERVIEW HE CALLED A MANSION WAS SOLD HE CONSIDERED MY BUSINESS AS CONCLUDED WHEN I ASKED WHO HAD PURCHASED IT
726-124445-0051 HE OPENED HIS EYES A THOUGHT WIDER AND PAUSED A FEW SECONDS BEFORE REPLYING IT IS SOLD SIR PARDON ME I SAID WITH EQUAL POLITENESS BUT I HAVE A SPECIAL REASON FOR WISHING TO KNOW WHO PURCHASED IT
726-124445-0052 AGAIN HE PAUSED LONGER AND RAISED HIS EYEBROWS STILL MORE IT IS SOLD SIR WAS AGAIN HIS LACONIC REPLY SURELY I SAID YOU DO NOT MIND LETTING ME KNOW SO MUCH
726-124445-0053 BUT I DO MIND HE ANSWERED THE AFFAIRS OF THEIR CLIENTS ARE ABSOLUTELY SAFE IN THE HANDS OF MITCHELL SONS AND CANDY THIS WAS MANIFESTLY A PRIG OF THE FIRST WATER AND THERE WAS NO USE ARGUING WITH HIM
726-124445-0054 I THOUGHT I HAD BEST MEET HIM ON HIS OWN GROUND SO I SAID YOUR CLIENTS SIR ARE HAPPY IN HAVING SO RESOLUTE A GUARDIAN OF THEIR CONFIDENCE I AM MYSELF A PROFESSIONAL MAN HERE I HANDED HIM MY CARD
726-124445-0055 IN THIS INSTANCE I AM NOT PROMPTED BY CURIOSITY I ACT ON THE PART OF LORD GODALMING WHO WISHES TO KNOW SOMETHING OF THE PROPERTY WHICH WAS HE UNDERSTOOD LATELY FOR SALE THESE WORDS PUT A DIFFERENT COMPLEXION ON AFFAIRS
726-124445-0056 HE SAID I WOULD LIKE TO OBLIGE YOU IF I COULD MISTER HARKER AND ESPECIALLY WOULD I LIKE TO OBLIGE HIS LORDSHIP WE ONCE CARRIED OUT A SMALL MATTER OF RENTING SOME CHAMBERS FOR HIM WHEN HE WAS THE HONOURABLE ARTHUR HOLMWOOD
726-124445-0057 IF YOU WILL LET ME HAVE HIS LORDSHIP'S ADDRESS I WILL CONSULT THE HOUSE ON THE SUBJECT AND WILL IN ANY CASE COMMUNICATE WITH HIS LORDSHIP BY TO NIGHT'S POST IT WILL BE A PLEASURE IF WE CAN SO FAR DEVIATE FROM OUR RULES AS TO GIVE THE REQUIRED INFORMATION TO HIS LORDSHIP
726-124445-0058 SO I THANKED HIM GAVE THE ADDRESS AT DOCTOR SEWARD'S AND CAME AWAY IT WAS NOW DARK AND I WAS TIRED AND HUNGRY I GOT A CUP OF TEA AT THE AERATED BREAD COMPANY AND CAME DOWN TO PURFLEET BY THE NEXT TRAIN
726-124445-0059 I FOUND ALL THE OTHERS AT HOME MINA WAS LOOKING TIRED AND PALE BUT SHE MADE A GALLANT EFFORT TO BE BRIGHT AND CHEERFUL IT WRUNG MY HEART TO THINK THAT I HAD HAD TO KEEP ANYTHING FROM HER AND SO CAUSED HER INQUIETUDE
726-124445-0060 THANK GOD THIS WILL BE THE LAST NIGHT OF HER LOOKING ON AT OUR CONFERENCES AND FEELING THE STING OF OUR NOT SHOWING OUR CONFIDENCE IT TOOK ALL MY COURAGE TO HOLD TO THE WISE RESOLUTION OF KEEPING HER OUT OF OUR GRIM TASK
726-124445-0061 SHE SEEMS SOMEHOW MORE RECONCILED OR ELSE THE VERY SUBJECT SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME REPUGNANT TO HER FOR WHEN ANY ACCIDENTAL ALLUSION IS MADE SHE ACTUALLY SHUDDERS I AM GLAD WE MADE OUR RESOLUTION IN TIME
726-124445-0062 AS WITH SUCH A FEELING AS THIS OUR GROWING KNOWLEDGE WOULD BE TORTURE TO HER I COULD NOT TELL THE OTHERS OF THE DAY'S DISCOVERY TILL WE WERE ALONE
726-124445-0063 SO AFTER DINNER FOLLOWED BY A LITTLE MUSIC TO SAVE APPEARANCES EVEN AMONGST OURSELVES I TOOK MINA TO HER ROOM AND LEFT HER TO GO TO BED
726-124445-0064 THANK GOD THE CEASING OF TELLING THINGS HAS MADE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US WHEN I CAME DOWN AGAIN I FOUND THE OTHERS ALL GATHERED ROUND THE FIRE IN THE STUDY IN THE TRAIN I HAD WRITTEN MY DIARY SO FAR
726-124445-0065 AND SIMPLY READ IT OFF TO THEM AS THE BEST MEANS OF LETTING THEM GET ABREAST OF MY OWN INFORMATION WHEN I HAD FINISHED VAN HELSING SAID THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT DAY'S WORK FRIEND JONATHAN DOUBTLESS WE ARE ON THE TRACK OF THE MISSING BOXES
726-124445-0066 IF WE FIND THEM ALL IN THAT HOUSE THEN OUR WORK IS NEAR THE END BUT IF THERE BE SOME MISSING WE MUST SEARCH UNTIL WE FIND THEM THEN SHALL WE MAKE OUR FINAL COUP AND HUNT THE WRETCH TO HIS REAL DEATH
726-124445-0067 WE ALL SAT SILENT AWHILE AND ALL AT ONCE MISTER MORRIS SPOKE SAY HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET INTO THAT HOUSE WE GOT INTO THE OTHER ANSWERED LORD GODALMING QUICKLY BUT ART THIS IS DIFFERENT
726-124445-0068 QUINCEY'S HEAD IS LEVEL THIS BURGLARY BUSINESS IS GETTING SERIOUS WE GOT OFF ONCE ALL RIGHT BUT WE HAVE NOW A RARE JOB ON HAND UNLESS WE CAN FIND THE COUNT'S KEY BASKET AS NOTHING COULD WELL BE DONE BEFORE MORNING
726-124445-0069 AND AS IT WOULD BE AT LEAST ADVISABLE TO WAIT TILL LORD GODALMING SHOULD HEAR FROM MITCHELL'S WE DECIDED NOT TO TAKE ANY ACTIVE STEP BEFORE BREAKFAST TIME FOR A GOOD WHILE WE SAT AND SMOKED DISCUSSING THE MATTER IN ITS VARIOUS LIGHTS AND BEARINGS
726-124445-0070 I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF BRINGING THIS DIARY RIGHT UP TO THE MOMENT I AM VERY SLEEPY AND SHALL GO TO BED JUST A LINE MINA SLEEPS SOUNDLY AND HER BREATHING IS REGULAR HER FOREHEAD IS PUCKERED UP INTO LITTLE WRINKLES
726-124445-0071 AS THOUGH SHE THINKS EVEN IN HER SLEEP SHE IS STILL TOO PALE BUT DOES NOT LOOK SO HAGGARD AS SHE DID THIS MORNING TO MORROW WILL I HOPE MEND ALL THIS SHE WILL BE HERSELF AT HOME IN EXETER
726-124445-0072 OH BUT I AM SLEEPY DOCTOR SEWARD'S DIARY
726-124445-0073 I AM PUZZLED AFRESH ABOUT RENFIELD HIS MOODS CHANGE SO RAPIDLY THAT I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO KEEP TOUCH OF THEM AND AS THEY ALWAYS MEAN SOMETHING MORE THAN HIS OWN WELL BEING THEY FORM A MORE THAN INTERESTING STUDY
726-124445-0074 THIS MORNING WHEN I WENT TO SEE HIM AFTER HIS REPULSE OF VAN HELSING HIS MANNER WAS THAT OF A MAN COMMANDING DESTINY HE WAS IN FACT COMMANDING DESTINY SUBJECTIVELY HE DID NOT REALLY CARE FOR ANY OF THE THINGS OF MERE EARTH
726-124445-0075 HE WAS IN THE CLOUDS AND LOOKED DOWN ON ALL THE WEAKNESSES AND WANTS OF US POOR MORTALS I THOUGHT I WOULD IMPROVE THE OCCASION AND LEARN SOMETHING SO I ASKED HIM WHAT ABOUT THE FLIES THESE TIMES
726-124445-0076 AS HE ANSWERED ME THE FLY MY DEAR SIR HAS ONE STRIKING FEATURE ITS WINGS ARE TYPICAL OF THE AERIAL POWERS OF THE PSYCHIC FACULTIES THE ANCIENTS DID WELL WHEN THEY TYPIFIED THE SOUL AS A BUTTERFLY
726-124445-0077 I THOUGHT I WOULD PUSH HIS ANALOGY TO ITS UTMOST LOGICALLY SO I SAID QUICKLY OH IT IS A SOUL YOU ARE AFTER NOW IS IT HIS MADNESS FOILED HIS REASON AND A PUZZLED LOOK SPREAD OVER HIS FACE AS
726-124445-0078 SHAKING HIS HEAD WITH A DECISION WHICH I HAD BUT SELDOM SEEN IN HIM HE SAID OH NO OH NO I WANT NO SOULS LIFE IS ALL I WANT HERE HE BRIGHTENED UP I AM PRETTY INDIFFERENT ABOUT IT AT PRESENT
726-124445-0079 LIFE IS ALL RIGHT I HAVE ALL I WANT YOU MUST GET A NEW PATIENT DOCTOR
726-124445-0080 THIS PUZZLED ME A LITTLE SO I DREW HIM ON THEN YOU COMMAND LIFE YOU ARE A GOD I SUPPOSE HE SMILED WITH AN INEFFABLY BENIGN SUPERIORITY OH NO
726-124445-0081 FAR BE IT FROM ME TO ARROGATE TO MYSELF THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE DEITY I AM NOT EVEN CONCERNED IN HIS ESPECIALLY SPIRITUAL DOINGS IF I MAY STATE MY INTELLECTUAL POSITION I AM SO FAR AS CONCERNS THINGS PURELY TERRESTRIAL
726-124445-0082 SOMEWHAT IN THE POSITION WHICH ENOCH OCCUPIED SPIRITUALLY THIS WAS A POSER TO ME I COULD NOT AT THE MOMENT RECALL ENOCH'S APPOSITENESS SO I HAD TO ASK A SIMPLE QUESTION
726-124445-0083 THOUGH I FELT THAT BY SO DOING I WAS LOWERING MYSELF IN THE EYES OF THE LUNATIC AND WHY WITH ENOCH BECAUSE HE WALKED WITH GOD I COULD NOT SEE THE ANALOGY BUT DID NOT LIKE TO ADMIT IT
726-124445-0084 SO I HARKED BACK TO WHAT HE HAD DENIED SO YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT LIFE AND YOU DON'T WANT SOULS WHY NOT I PUT MY QUESTION QUICKLY AND SOMEWHAT STERNLY ON PURPOSE TO DISCONCERT HIM THE EFFORT SUCCEEDED
726-124445-0085 FOR AN INSTANT HE UNCONSCIOUSLY RELAPSED INTO HIS OLD SERVILE MANNER BENT LOW BEFORE ME AND ACTUALLY FAWNED UPON ME AS HE REPLIED I DON'T WANT ANY SOULS INDEED INDEED I DON'T I COULDN'T USE THEM IF I HAD THEM THEY WOULD BE NO MANNER OF USE TO ME
726-124445-0086 I COULDN'T EAT THEM OR HE SUDDENLY STOPPED AND THE OLD CUNNING LOOK SPREAD OVER HIS FACE LIKE A WIND SWEEP ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AND DOCTOR AS TO LIFE WHAT IS IT AFTER ALL WHEN YOU'VE GOT ALL YOU REQUIRE
726-124445-0087 AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU WILL NEVER WANT THAT IS ALL I HAVE FRIENDS GOOD FRIENDS LIKE YOU DOCTOR SEWARD THIS WAS SAID WITH A LEER OF INEXPRESSIBLE CUNNING I KNOW THAT I SHALL NEVER LACK THE MEANS OF LIFE
726-124445-0088 I THINK THAT THROUGH THE CLOUDINESS OF HIS INSANITY HE SAW SOME ANTAGONISM IN ME FOR HE AT ONCE FELL BACK ON THE LAST REFUGE OF SUCH AS HE A DOGGED SILENCE
726-124445-0089 HE WAS SULKY AND SO I CAME AWAY LATER IN THE DAY HE SENT FOR ME ORDINARILY I WOULD NOT HAVE COME WITHOUT SPECIAL REASON BUT JUST AT PRESENT I AM SO INTERESTED IN HIM THAT I WOULD GLADLY MAKE AN EFFORT
726-124445-0090 HARKER IS OUT FOLLOWING UP CLUES AND SO ARE LORD GODALMING AND QUINCEY VAN HELSING SITS IN MY STUDY PORING OVER THE RECORD PREPARED BY THE HARKERS
726-124445-0091 HE DOES NOT WISH TO BE DISTURBED IN THE WORK WITHOUT CAUSE I WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM WITH ME TO SEE THE PATIENT ONLY I THOUGHT THAT AFTER HIS LAST REPULSE HE MIGHT NOT CARE TO GO AGAIN THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER REASON
726-124445-0092 RENFIELD MIGHT NOT SPEAK SO FREELY BEFORE A THIRD PERSON AS WHEN HE AND I WERE ALONE
726-124445-0093 A POSE WHICH IS GENERALLY INDICATIVE OF SOME MENTAL ENERGY ON HIS PART WHEN I CAME IN HE SAID AT ONCE AS THOUGH THE QUESTION HAD BEEN WAITING ON HIS LIPS WHAT ABOUT SOULS
726-124445-0094 IT WAS EVIDENT THEN THAT MY SURMISE HAD BEEN CORRECT UNCONSCIOUS CEREBRATION WAS DOING ITS WORK EVEN WITH THE LUNATIC I DETERMINED TO HAVE THE MATTER OUT WHAT ABOUT THEM YOURSELF I ASKED
726-124445-0095 HE DID NOT REPLY FOR A MOMENT BUT LOOKED ALL ROUND HIM AND UP AND DOWN AS THOUGH HE EXPECTED TO FIND SOME INSPIRATION FOR AN ANSWER I DON'T WANT ANY SOULS HE SAID IN A FEEBLE APOLOGETIC WAY
726-124445-0096 THE MATTER SEEMED PREYING ON HIS MIND AND SO I DETERMINED TO USE IT TO BE CRUEL ONLY TO BE KIND SO I SAID YOU LIKE LIFE AND YOU WANT LIFE OH YES BUT THAT IS ALL RIGHT YOU NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT
726-124445-0097 BUT I ASKED HOW ARE WE TO GET THE LIFE WITHOUT GETTING THE SOUL ALSO THIS SEEMED TO PUZZLE HIM SO I FOLLOWED IT UP
726-124445-0098 YOU'VE GOT THEIR LIVES YOU KNOW AND YOU MUST PUT UP WITH THEIR SOULS SOMETHING SEEMED TO AFFECT HIS IMAGINATION FOR HE PUT HIS FINGERS TO HIS EARS AND SHUT HIS EYES SCREWING THEM UP TIGHTLY JUST AS A SMALL BOY DOES WHEN HIS FACE IS BEING SOAPED
726-124445-0099 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN IT THAT TOUCHED ME IT ALSO GAVE ME A LESSON FOR IT SEEMED THAT BEFORE ME WAS A CHILD ONLY A CHILD THOUGH THE FEATURES WERE WORN AND THE STUBBLE ON THE JAWS WAS WHITE
726-124445-0100 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS UNDERGOING SOME PROCESS OF MENTAL DISTURBANCE AND KNOWING HOW HIS PAST MOODS HAD INTERPRETED THINGS SEEMINGLY FOREIGN TO HIMSELF I THOUGHT I WOULD ENTER INTO HIS MIND AS WELL AS I COULD AND GO WITH HIM
726-124445-0101 THE FIRST STEP WAS TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE SO I ASKED HIM SPEAKING PRETTY LOUD SO THAT HE WOULD HEAR ME THROUGH HIS CLOSED EARS
726-124445-0102 WITH A LAUGH HE REPLIED NOT MUCH FLIES ARE POOR THINGS AFTER ALL AFTER A PAUSE HE ADDED BUT I DON'T WANT THEIR SOULS BUZZING ROUND ME ALL THE SAME OR SPIDERS I WENT ON BLOW SPIDERS WHAT'S THE USE OF SPIDERS
726-124445-0103 THERE ISN'T ANYTHING IN THEM TO EAT OR HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AS THOUGH REMINDED OF A FORBIDDEN TOPIC SO SO I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THIS IS THE SECOND TIME HE HAS SUDDENLY STOPPED AT THE WORD DRINK WHAT DOES IT MEAN
726-124445-0104 RENFIELD SEEMED HIMSELF AWARE OF HAVING MADE A LAPSE FOR HE HURRIED ON AS THOUGH TO DISTRACT MY ATTENTION FROM IT I DON'T TAKE ANY STOCK AT ALL IN SUCH MATTERS RATS AND MICE AND SUCH SMALL DEER AS SHAKESPEARE HAS IT
726-124445-0105 CHICKEN FEED OF THE LARDER THEY MIGHT BE CALLED I'M PAST ALL THAT SORT OF NONSENSE YOU MIGHT AS WELL ASK A MAN TO EAT MOLECULES WITH A PAIR OF CHOP STICKS AS TO TRY TO INTEREST ME ABOUT THE LESSER CARNIVORA WHEN I KNOW OF WHAT IS BEFORE ME
726-124445-0106 I SEE I SAID YOU WANT BIG THINGS THAT YOU CAN MAKE YOUR TEETH MEET IN HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BREAKFAST ON ELEPHANT WHAT RIDICULOUS NONSENSE YOU ARE TALKING HE WAS GETTING TOO WIDE AWAKE SO I THOUGHT I WOULD PRESS HIM HARD
726-124445-0107 I WONDER I SAID REFLECTIVELY WHAT AN ELEPHANT'S SOUL IS LIKE THE EFFECT I DESIRED WAS OBTAINED FOR HE AT ONCE FELL FROM HIS HIGH HORSE AND BECAME A CHILD AGAIN I DON'T WANT AN ELEPHANT'S SOUL OR ANY SOUL AT ALL HE SAID
726-124445-0108 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE SAT DESPONDENTLY SUDDENLY HE JUMPED TO HIS FEET WITH HIS EYES BLAZING AND ALL THE SIGNS OF INTENSE CEREBRAL EXCITEMENT TO HELL WITH YOU AND YOUR SOULS HE SHOUTED
726-124445-0109 HE LOOKED SO HOSTILE THAT I THOUGHT HE WAS IN FOR ANOTHER HOMICIDAL FIT SO I BLEW MY WHISTLE THE INSTANT HOWEVER THAT I DID SO HE BECAME CALM AND SAID APOLOGETICALLY FORGIVE ME DOCTOR I FORGOT MYSELF
726-124445-0110 YOU DO NOT NEED ANY HELP I AM SO WORRIED IN MY MIND THAT I AM APT TO BE IRRITABLE IF YOU ONLY KNEW THE PROBLEM I HAVE TO FACE AND THAT I AM WORKING OUT YOU WOULD PITY AND TOLERATE AND PARDON ME PRAY DO NOT PUT ME IN A STRAIT WAISTCOAT
726-124445-0111 I WANT TO THINK AND I CANNOT THINK FREELY WHEN MY BODY IS CONFINED I AM SURE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND HE HAD EVIDENTLY SELF CONTROL SO WHEN THE ATTENDANTS CAME I TOLD THEM NOT TO MIND AND THEY WITHDREW
726-124445-0112 RENFIELD WATCHED THEM GO WHEN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED HE SAID WITH CONSIDERABLE DIGNITY AND SWEETNESS DOCTOR SEWARD YOU HAVE BEEN VERY CONSIDERATE TOWARDS ME BELIEVE ME THAT I AM VERY VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU
726-124445-0113 I THOUGHT IT WELL TO LEAVE HIM IN THIS MOOD AND SO I CAME AWAY THERE IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO PONDER OVER IN THIS MAN'S STATE SEVERAL POINTS SEEM TO MAKE WHAT THE AMERICAN INTERVIEWER CALLS A STORY
726-124445-0114 IF ONE COULD ONLY GET THEM IN PROPER ORDER HERE THEY ARE WILL NOT MENTION DRINKING FEARS THE THOUGHT OF BEING BURDENED WITH THE SOUL OF ANYTHING HAS NO DREAD OF WANTING LIFE IN THE FUTURE
726-124445-0115 DESPISES THE MEANER FORMS OF LIFE ALTOGETHER THOUGH HE DREADS BEING HAUNTED BY THEIR SOULS LOGICALLY ALL THESE THINGS POINT ONE WAY HE HAS ASSURANCE OF SOME KIND THAT HE WILL ACQUIRE SOME HIGHER LIFE
726-124445-0116 HE DREADS THE CONSEQUENCE THE BURDEN OF A SOUL THEN IT IS A HUMAN LIFE HE LOOKS TO AND THE ASSURANCE MERCIFUL GOD THE COUNT HAS BEEN TO HIM AND THERE IS SOME NEW SCHEME OF TERROR AFOOT
726-124445-0117 LATER
726-124445-0118 HE GREW VERY GRAVE AND AFTER THINKING THE MATTER OVER FOR A WHILE ASKED ME TO TAKE HIM TO RENFIELD I DID SO AS WE CAME TO THE DOOR WE HEARD THE LUNATIC WITHIN SINGING GAILY AS HE USED TO DO IN THE TIME WHICH NOW SEEMS SO LONG AGO
726-124445-0119 WHEN WE ENTERED WE SAW WITH AMAZEMENT THAT HE HAD SPREAD OUT HIS SUGAR AS OF OLD THE FLIES LETHARGIC WITH THE AUTUMN WERE BEGINNING TO BUZZ INTO THE ROOM WE TRIED TO MAKE HIM TALK OF THE SUBJECT OF OUR PREVIOUS CONVERSATION
726-124445-0120 BUT HE WOULD NOT ATTEND HE WENT ON WITH HIS SINGING JUST AS THOUGH WE HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT HE HAD GOT A SCRAP OF PAPER AND WAS FOLDING IT INTO A NOTE BOOK WE HAD TO COME AWAY AS IGNORANT AS WE WENT IN
726-124445-0121 HIS IS A CURIOUS CASE INDEED WE MUST WATCH HIM TO NIGHT LETTER MITCHELL SONS AND CANDY TO LORD GODALMING
726-124445-0122 MY LORD WE ARE AT ALL TIMES ONLY TOO HAPPY TO MEET YOUR WISHES WE BEG WITH REGARD TO THE DESIRE OF YOUR LORDSHIP EXPRESSED BY MISTER HARKER ON YOUR BEHALF

726-124445-0125 I PLACED A MAN IN THE CORRIDOR LAST NIGHT AND TOLD HIM TO MAKE AN ACCURATE NOTE OF ANY SOUND HE MIGHT HEAR FROM RENFIELD'S ROOM AND GAVE HIM INSTRUCTIONS THAT IF THERE SHOULD BE ANYTHING STRANGE HE WAS TO CALL ME
726-124445-0126 AFTER DINNER WHEN WE HAD ALL GATHERED ROUND THE FIRE IN THE STUDY MISSUS HARKER HAVING GONE TO BED WE DISCUSSED THE ATTEMPTS AND DISCOVERIES OF THE DAY HARKER WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD ANY RESULT
726-124445-0127 AND WE ARE IN GREAT HOPES THAT HIS CLUE MAY BE AN IMPORTANT ONE BEFORE GOING TO BED I WENT ROUND TO THE PATIENT'S ROOM AND LOOKED IN THROUGH THE OBSERVATION TRAP
726-124445-0128 THIS MORNING THE MAN ON DUTY REPORTED TO ME THAT A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT HE WAS RESTLESS AND KEPT SAYING HIS PRAYERS SOMEWHAT LOUDLY I ASKED HIM IF THAT WAS ALL HE REPLIED THAT IT WAS ALL HE HEARD
726-124445-0129 THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIS MANNER SO SUSPICIOUS THAT I ASKED HIM POINT BLANK IF HE HAD BEEN ASLEEP HE DENIED SLEEP BUT ADMITTED TO HAVING DOZED FOR A WHILE IT IS TOO BAD THAT MEN CANNOT BE TRUSTED UNLESS THEY ARE WATCHED
726-124445-0130 TO DAY HARKER IS OUT FOLLOWING UP HIS CLUE AND ART AND QUINCEY ARE LOOKING AFTER HORSES GODALMING THINKS THAT IT WILL BE WELL TO HAVE HORSES ALWAYS IN READINESS
726-124445-0131 FOR WHEN WE GET THE INFORMATION WHICH WE SEEK THERE WILL BE NO TIME TO LOSE WE MUST STERILISE ALL THE IMPORTED EARTH BETWEEN SUNRISE AND SUNSET WE SHALL THUS CATCH THE COUNT AT HIS WEAKEST AND WITHOUT A REFUGE TO FLY TO
726-124445-0132 VAN HELSING IS OFF TO THE BRITISH MUSEUM LOOKING UP SOME AUTHORITIES ON ANCIENT MEDICINE THE OLD PHYSICIANS TOOK ACCOUNT OF THINGS WHICH THEIR FOLLOWERS DO NOT ACCEPT AND THE PROFESSOR IS SEARCHING FOR WITCH AND DEMON CURES WHICH MAY BE USEFUL TO US LATER
726-124445-0133 I SOMETIMES THINK WE MUST BE ALL MAD AND THAT WE SHALL WAKE TO SANITY IN STRAIT WAISTCOATS LATER WE HAVE MET AGAIN WE SEEM AT LAST TO BE ON THE TRACK AND OUR WORK OF TO MORROW MAY BE THE BEGINNING OF THE END
726-124445-0134 I WONDER IF RENFIELD'S QUIET HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS HIS MOODS HAVE SO FOLLOWED THE DOINGS OF THE COUNT
726-124445-0135 IF WE COULD ONLY GET SOME HINT AS TO WHAT PASSED IN HIS MIND BETWEEN THE TIME OF MY ARGUMENT WITH HIM TO DAY AND HIS RESUMPTION OF FLY CATCHING IT MIGHT AFFORD US A VALUABLE CLUE HE IS NOW SEEMINGLY QUIET FOR A SPELL IS HE
726-124445-0136 THAT WILD YELL SEEMED TO COME FROM HIS ROOM THE ATTENDANT CAME BURSTING INTO MY ROOM AND TOLD ME THAT RENFIELD HAD SOMEHOW MET WITH SOME ACCIDENT HE HAD HEARD HIM YELL AND WHEN HE WENT TO HIM FOUND HIM LYING ON HIS FACE ON THE FLOOR ALL COVERED WITH BLOOD
