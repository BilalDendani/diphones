3294-167597-0000 THEY DIFFERED FROM THEM IN SPEECH DRESS AND DISPOSITION THEY WERE CALLED STEPPE PEASANTS THE OLD PRINCE USED TO APPROVE OF THEM FOR THEIR ENDURANCE AT WORK WHEN THEY CAME TO BALD HILLS TO HELP WITH THE HARVEST OR TO DIG PONDS AND DITCHES
3294-167597-0001 BUT HE DISLIKED THEM FOR THEIR BOORISHNESS PRINCE ANDREW'S LAST STAY AT BOGUCHAROVO WHEN HE INTRODUCED HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS
3294-167597-0002 BUT HAD ON THE CONTRARY STRENGTHENED IN THEM THE TRAITS OF CHARACTER THE OLD PRINCE CALLED BOORISHNESS VARIOUS OBSCURE RUMORS WERE ALWAYS CURRENT AMONG THEM AT ONE TIME A RUMOR THAT THEY WOULD ALL BE ENROLLED AS COSSACKS
3294-167597-0003 AT ANOTHER OF A NEW RELIGION TO WHICH THEY WERE ALL TO BE CONVERTED
3294-167597-0004 IN CONNECTION WITH WHICH IT WAS RUMORED THAT FREEDOM HAD BEEN GRANTED THEM BUT THE LANDOWNERS HAD STOPPED IT THEN OF PETER FEDOROVICH'S RETURN TO THE THRONE IN SEVEN YEARS TIME WHEN EVERYTHING WOULD BE MADE FREE AND SO SIMPLE THAT THERE WOULD BE NO RESTRICTIONS
3294-167597-0005 RUMORS OF THE WAR WITH BONAPARTE AND HIS INVASION WERE CONNECTED IN THEIR MINDS WITH THE SAME SORT OF VAGUE NOTIONS OF ANTICHRIST THE END OF THE WORLD AND PURE FREEDOM IN THE VICINITY OF BOGUCHAROVO WERE LARGE VILLAGES BELONGING TO THE CROWN
3294-167597-0006 OR TO OWNERS WHOSE SERFS PAID QUITRENT AND COULD WORK WHERE THEY PLEASED THERE WERE VERY FEW RESIDENT LANDLORDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND ALSO VERY FEW DOMESTIC OR LITERATE SERFS
3294-167597-0007 AND IN THE LIVES OF THE PEASANTRY OF THOSE PARTS THE MYSTERIOUS UNDERCURRENTS IN THE LIFE OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE THE CAUSES AND MEANING OF WHICH ARE SO BAFFLING TO CONTEMPORARIES WERE MORE CLEARLY AND STRONGLY NOTICEABLE THAN AMONG OTHERS
3294-167597-0008 ONE INSTANCE WHICH HAD OCCURRED SOME TWENTY YEARS BEFORE WAS A MOVEMENT AMONG THE PEASANTS TO EMIGRATE TO SOME UNKNOWN WARM RIVERS HUNDREDS OF PEASANTS AMONG THEM THE BOGUCHAROVO FOLK
3294-167597-0009 SUDDENLY BEGAN SELLING THEIR CATTLE AND MOVING IN WHOLE FAMILIES TOWARD THE SOUTHEAST AS BIRDS MIGRATE TO SOMEWHERE BEYOND THE SEA SO THESE MEN WITH THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN STREAMED TO THE SOUTHEAST TO PARTS WHERE NONE OF THEM HAD EVER BEEN
3294-167597-0010 THEY SET OFF IN CARAVANS BOUGHT THEIR FREEDOM ONE BY ONE OR RAN AWAY AND DROVE OR WALKED TOWARD THE WARM RIVERS MANY OF THEM WERE PUNISHED SOME SENT TO SIBERIA MANY DIED OF COLD AND HUNGER ON THE ROAD MANY RETURNED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD
3294-167597-0011 AND THE MOVEMENT DIED DOWN OF ITSELF JUST AS IT HAD SPRUNG UP WITHOUT APPARENT REASON BUT SUCH UNDERCURRENTS STILL EXISTED AMONG THE PEOPLE AND GATHERED NEW FORCES READY TO MANIFEST THEMSELVES
3294-167597-0012 JUST AS STRANGELY UNEXPECTEDLY AND AT THE SAME TIME SIMPLY NATURALLY AND FORCIBLY NOW IN EIGHTEEN TWELVE TO ANYONE LIVING IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH THESE PEOPLE IT WAS APPARENT THAT THESE UNDERCURRENTS WERE ACTING STRONGLY AND NEARING AN ERUPTION
3294-167597-0013 NOTICED AN AGITATION AMONG THE PEASANTS AND THAT CONTRARY TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE BALD HILLS DISTRICT WHERE
3294-167597-0014 THE PEASANTS IN THE STEPPE REGION ROUND BOGUCHAROVO WERE IT WAS RUMORED IN TOUCH WITH THE FRENCH RECEIVED LEAFLETS FROM THEM THAT PASSED FROM HAND TO HAND AND DID NOT MIGRATE HE LEARNED FROM DOMESTIC SERFS LOYAL TO HIM
3294-167597-0015 THAT THE PEASANT KARP WHO POSSESSED GREAT INFLUENCE IN THE VILLAGE COMMUNE AND HAD RECENTLY BEEN AWAY DRIVING A GOVERNMENT TRANSPORT HAD RETURNED WITH NEWS THAT THE COSSACKS WERE DESTROYING DESERTED VILLAGES BUT THAT THE FRENCH DID NOT HARM THEM
3294-167597-0016 THAT ON THE PREVIOUS DAY ANOTHER PEASANT HAD EVEN BROUGHT FROM THE VILLAGE OF VISLOUKHOVO WHICH WAS OCCUPIED BY THE FRENCH A PROCLAMATION BY A FRENCH GENERAL THAT NO HARM WOULD BE DONE TO THE INHABITANTS AND IF THEY REMAINED THEY WOULD BE PAID FOR ANYTHING TAKEN FROM THEM
3294-167597-0017 AS PROOF OF THIS THE PEASANT HAD BROUGHT FROM VISLOUKHOVO A HUNDRED RUBLES IN NOTES HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY WERE FALSE PAID TO HIM IN ADVANCE FOR HAY MORE IMPORTANT STILL
3294-167597-0018 YET THERE WAS NO TIME TO WASTE ON THE FIFTEENTH THE DAY OF THE OLD PRINCE'S DEATH THE MARSHAL HAD INSISTED ON PRINCESS MARY'S LEAVING AT ONCE AS IT WAS BECOMING DANGEROUS HE HAD TOLD HER THAT AFTER THE SIXTEENTH
3294-167597-0019 HE COULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN ON THE EVENING OF THE DAY THE OLD PRINCE DIED THE MARSHAL WENT AWAY PROMISING TO RETURN NEXT DAY FOR THE FUNERAL BUT THIS HE WAS UNABLE TO DO
3294-167597-0020 FOR HE RECEIVED TIDINGS THAT THE FRENCH HAD UNEXPECTEDLY ADVANCED AND HAD BARELY TIME TO REMOVE HIS OWN FAMILY AND VALUABLES FROM HIS ESTATE FOR SOME THIRTY YEARS BOGUCHAROVO HAD BEEN MANAGED BY THE VILLAGE ELDER DRON
3294-167597-0021 WHOM THE OLD PRINCE CALLED BY THE DIMINUTIVE DRONUSHKA DRON WAS ONE OF THOSE PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY VIGOROUS PEASANTS WHO GROW BIG BEARDS AS SOON AS THEY ARE OF AGE AND GO ON UNCHANGED TILL THEY ARE SIXTY OR SEVENTY
3294-167597-0022 WITHOUT A GRAY HAIR OR THE LOSS OF A TOOTH AS STRAIGHT AND STRONG AT SIXTY AS AT THIRTY SOON AFTER THE MIGRATION TO THE WARM RIVERS IN WHICH HE HAD TAKEN PART LIKE THE REST DRON WAS MADE VILLAGE ELDER AND OVERSEER OF BOGUCHAROVO
3294-167597-0023 AND HAD SINCE FILLED THAT POST IRREPROACHABLY FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS THE PEASANTS FEARED HIM MORE THAN THEY DID THEIR MASTER THE MASTERS BOTH THE OLD PRINCE AND THE YOUNG AND THE STEWARD RESPECTED HIM AND JESTINGLY CALLED HIM THE MINISTER
3294-167597-0024 DURING THE WHOLE TIME OF HIS SERVICE DRON HAD NEVER BEEN DRUNK OR ILL NEVER AFTER SLEEPLESS NIGHTS OR THE HARDEST TASKS HAD HE SHOWN THE LEAST FATIGUE AND THOUGH HE COULD NOT READ HE HAD NEVER
3294-167597-0025 FORGOTTEN A SINGLE MONEY ACCOUNT OR THE NUMBER OF QUARTERS OF FLOUR IN ANY OF THE ENDLESS CARTLOADS HE SOLD FOR THE PRINCE NOR A SINGLE SHOCK OF THE WHOLE CORN CROP ON ANY SINGLE ACRE OF THE BOGUCHAROVO FIELDS
3294-167597-0026 SENT FOR HIS DRON ON THE DAY OF THE PRINCE'S FUNERAL AND TOLD HIM TO HAVE TWELVE HORSES GOT READY FOR THE PRINCESS CARRIAGES AND EIGHTEEN CARTS FOR THE THINGS TO BE REMOVED FROM BOGUCHAROVO THOUGH THE PEASANTS PAID QUITRENT
3294-167597-0027 FOR THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY HOUSEHOLDS AT WORK IN BOGUCHAROVO AND THE PEASANTS WERE WELL TO DO BUT ON HEARING THE ORDER DRON LOWERED HIS EYES AND REMAINED SILENT
3294-167597-0028 ALPATYCH NAMED CERTAIN PEASANTS HE KNEW FROM WHOM HE TOLD HIM TO TAKE THE CARTS DRON REPLIED THAT THE HORSES OF THESE PEASANTS WERE AWAY CARTING
3294-167597-0029 HAD NO HORSES AVAILABLE SOME HORSES WERE CARTING FOR THE GOVERNMENT OTHERS WERE TOO WEAK AND OTHERS HAD DIED FOR WANT OF FODDER IT SEEMED THAT NO HORSES COULD BE HAD EVEN FOR THE CARRIAGES MUCH LESS FOR THE CARTING
3294-167597-0030 POSSESSING IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE THE FACULTY OF DIVINING THE NEEDS AND INSTINCTS OF THOSE HE DEALT WITH HAVING GLANCED AT DRON HE AT ONCE UNDERSTOOD THAT HIS ANSWERS DID NOT EXPRESS HIS PERSONAL VIEWS BUT THE GENERAL MOOD OF THE BOGUCHAROVO COMMUNE
3294-167597-0031 BY WHICH THE ELDER HAD ALREADY BEEN CARRIED AWAY BUT HE ALSO KNEW THAT DRON WHO HAD ACQUIRED PROPERTY AND WAS HATED BY THE COMMUNE MUST BE HESITATING BETWEEN THE TWO CAMPS THE MASTERS AND THE SERFS
3294-167597-0032 HE NOTICED THIS HESITATION IN DRON'S LOOK AND THEREFORE FROWNED AND MOVED CLOSER UP TO HIM NOW JUST LISTEN DRONUSHKA SAID HE DON'T TALK NONSENSE TO ME
3294-167597-0033 HIS EXCELLENCY PRINCE ANDREW HIMSELF GAVE ME ORDERS TO MOVE ALL THE PEOPLE AWAY AND NOT LEAVE THEM WITH THE ENEMY AND THERE IS AN ORDER FROM THE TSAR ABOUT IT TOO ANYONE WHO STAYS IS A TRAITOR TO THE TSAR DO YOU HEAR
3294-167597-0034 I HEAR DRON ANSWERED WITHOUT LIFTING HIS EYES
3294-167597-0035 EH DRON IT WILL TURN OUT BADLY HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD THE POWER IS IN YOUR HANDS DRON REJOINED SADLY EH DRON DROP IT
3294-167597-0036 I CAN SEE THROUGH YOU AND THREE YARDS INTO THE GROUND UNDER YOU HE CONTINUED GAZING AT THE FLOOR IN FRONT OF DRON DRON WAS DISCONCERTED
3294-167597-0037 AGAIN LOWERED HIS EYES YOU DROP THIS NONSENSE AND TELL THE PEOPLE TO GET READY TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES AND GO TO MOSCOW
3294-167597-0038 AND DON'T GO TO ANY MEETING YOURSELF DO YOU HEAR DRON SUDDENLY FELL ON HIS KNEES
3294-167597-0039 STOP THAT CRIED ALPATYCH STERNLY I SEE THROUGH YOU AND THREE YARDS UNDER YOU HE REPEATED KNOWING THAT HIS SKILL IN BEEKEEPING HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE RIGHT TIME TO SOW THE OATS AND THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO RETAIN THE OLD PRINCE'S FAVOR FOR TWENTY YEARS
3294-167597-0040 AND THAT THE POWER OF SEEING THREE YARDS UNDER A MAN IS CONSIDERED AN ATTRIBUTE OF WIZARDS DRON GOT UP AND WAS ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHING BUT ALPATYCH INTERRUPTED HIM WHAT IS IT YOU HAVE GOT INTO YOUR HEADS EH WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF EH
3294-167597-0041 WHAT AM I TO DO WITH THE PEOPLE SAID DRON THEY'RE QUITE BESIDE THEMSELVES I HAVE ALREADY TOLD THEM TOLD THEM I DARE SAY
3294-167597-0042 ARE THEY DRINKING HE ASKED ABRUPTLY
3294-167597-0043 WELL THEN LISTEN I'LL GO TO THE POLICE OFFICER AND YOU TELL THEM SO AND THAT THEY MUST STOP THIS AND THE CARTS MUST BE GOT READY I UNDERSTAND ALPATYCH DID NOT INSIST FURTHER
3294-167597-0044 HE HAD MANAGED PEOPLE FOR A LONG TIME AND KNEW THAT THE CHIEF WAY TO MAKE THEM OBEY IS TO SHOW NO SUSPICION THAT THEY CAN POSSIBLY DISOBEY HAVING WRUNG A SUBMISSIVE I UNDERSTAND FROM DRON ALPATYCH CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH THAT THOUGH HE NOT ONLY DOUBTED
3294-167597-0045 THE CARTS WOULD NOT BE FORTHCOMING AND SO IT WAS FOR WHEN EVENING CAME NO CARTS HAD BEEN PROVIDED IN THE VILLAGE OUTSIDE THE DRINK SHOP ANOTHER MEETING WAS BEING HELD WHICH DECIDED THAT THE HORSES SHOULD BE DRIVEN OUT INTO THE WOODS
3294-167597-0046 AND THE CARTS SHOULD NOT BE PROVIDED WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING OF THIS TO THE PRINCESS ALPATYCH HAD HIS OWN BELONGINGS TAKEN OUT OF THE CARTS WHICH HAD ARRIVED FROM BALD HILLS
