497-129325-0019 THE MONEY MIGHT BE FOUND ON HER WHICH WOULD LEAVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY OF ASSERTING HIS INNOCENCE OF ANY THEFT AND WOULD GREATLY FACILITATE HIS CHANCES OF ESCAPE OF COURSE HE ENTERED AT THIS JUNCTURE
497-129325-0020 INTO NO EXPLANATION OF HIS MOTIVES AND THEY WALKED ON VERY LOVINGLY TOGETHER IN PURSUANCE OF THIS CAUTIOUS PLAN MISTER CLAYPOLE WENT ON WITHOUT HALTING UNTIL HE ARRIVED AT THE ANGEL
