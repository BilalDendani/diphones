2067-143536-0000 THE NEXT THING THAT I REMEMBER WAS OPENING MY EYES AND PERCEIVING THE FORM OF JOB WHO HAD NOW PRACTICALLY RECOVERED FROM HIS ATTACK OF FEVER HE WAS STANDING IN THE RAY OF LIGHT THAT PIERCED INTO THE CAVE FROM THE OUTER AIR SHAKING OUT MY CLOTHES AS A MAKESHIFT FOR BRUSHING THEM
2067-143536-0001 WHICH HE COULD NOT DO BECAUSE THERE WAS NO BRUSH
2067-143536-0002 HE PLACED IT ON A LEOPARD SKIN ON THE FLOOR AND STOOD BACK A STEP OR TWO TO OBSERVE THE EFFECT IT WAS NOT SATISFACTORY SO HE SHUT UP THE BAG TURNED IT ON END AND HAVING RESTED IT AGAINST THE FOOT OF THE COUCH PLACED THE DRESSING CASE ON IT
2067-143536-0003 NEXT HE LOOKED AT THE POTS FULL OF WATER WHICH CONSTITUTED OUR WASHING APPARATUS
2067-143536-0004 I HEARD HIM MURMUR NO HOT WATER IN THIS BEASTLY PLACE I SUPPOSE THESE POOR CREATURES ONLY USE IT TO BOIL EACH OTHER IN AND HE SIGHED DEEPLY WHAT IS THE MATTER JOB I SAID BEG PARDON SIR HE SAID TOUCHING HIS HAIR
2067-143536-0005 I THOUGHT YOU WERE ASLEEP SIR AND I AM SURE YOU SEEM AS THOUGH YOU WANT IT ONE MIGHT THINK FROM THE LOOK OF YOU THAT YOU HAD BEEN HAVING A NIGHT OF IT I ONLY GROANED BY WAY OF ANSWER I HAD INDEED BEEN HAVING A NIGHT OF IT SUCH AS I HOPE NEVER TO HAVE AGAIN
2067-143536-0006 HOW IS MISTER LEO JOB MUCH THE SAME SIR IF HE DON'T SOON MEND HE'LL END SIR AND THAT'S ALL ABOUT IT THOUGH I MUST SAY THAT THAT THERE SAVAGE USTANE DO DO HER BEST FOR HIM ALMOST LIKE A BAPTISED CHRISTIAN
2067-143536-0007 AND IF I VENTURES TO INTERFERE IT'S AWFUL TO SEE HER HER HAIR SEEMS TO STAND ON END AND SHE CURSES AND SWEARS AWAY IN HER HEATHEN TALK AT LEAST I FANCY SHE MUST BE CURSING FROM THE LOOK OF HER AND WHAT DO YOU DO THEN I MAKE HER A PERLITE BOW AND I SAY
2067-143536-0008 YOUNG WOMAN YOUR POSITION IS ONE THAT I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND AND CAN'T RECOGNISE LET ME TELL YOU THAT I HAS A DUTY TO PERFORM TO MY MASTER AS IS INCAPACITATED BY ILLNESS
2067-143536-0009 BUT SHE DON'T TAKE NO HEED NOT SHE ONLY CURSES AND SWEARS AWAY WORSE THAN EVER LAST NIGHT SHE PUT HER HAND UNDER THAT SORT OF NIGHT SHIRT SHE WEARS
2067-143536-0010 JOB LAID GREAT EMPHASIS ON THE FOOLS
2067-143536-0011 IT'S A JUDGMENT ON US SIR THAT'S MY VIEW AND I FOR ONE IS OF OPINION THAT THE JUDGMENT ISN'T HALF DONE YET AND WHEN IT IS DONE WE SHALL BE DONE TOO
2067-143536-0012 AND NOW SIR I MUST BE SEEING ABOUT MISTER LEO'S BROTH IF THAT WILD CAT WILL LET ME AND PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET UP SIR BECAUSE IT'S PAST NINE O'CLOCK JOB'S REMARKS WERE NOT OF AN EXACTLY CHEERING ORDER TO A MAN WHO HAD PASSED SUCH A NIGHT AS I HAD
2067-143536-0013 AND WHAT IS MORE THEY HAD THE WEIGHT OF TRUTH TAKING ONE THING WITH ANOTHER IT APPEARED TO ME TO BE AN UTTER IMPOSSIBILITY THAT WE SHOULD ESCAPE FROM THE PLACE WE WERE SUPPOSING THAT LEO RECOVERED AND SUPPOSING THAT SHE WOULD LET US GO WHICH WAS EXCEEDINGLY DOUBTFUL
2067-143536-0014 FORMED A STRONGER AND MORE IMPASSABLE FORTIFICATION ROUND THE VARIOUS AMAHAGGER HOUSEHOLDS THAN ANY THAT COULD BE BUILT OR DESIGNED BY MAN NO THERE WAS BUT ONE THING TO DO FACE IT OUT AND SPEAKING FOR MY OWN PART
2067-143536-0015 I WAS SO INTENSELY INTERESTED IN THE WHOLE WEIRD STORY THAT SO FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED NOTWITHSTANDING THE SHATTERED STATE OF MY NERVES I ASKED NOTHING BETTER EVEN IF MY LIFE PAID FORFEIT TO MY CURIOSITY
2067-143536-0016 WHAT MAN FOR WHOM PHYSIOLOGY HAS CHARMS COULD FORBEAR TO STUDY SUCH A CHARACTER AS THAT OF THIS AYESHA WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SO PRESENTED ITSELF THE VERY TERROR OF THE PURSUIT ADDED TO ITS FASCINATION AND BESIDES
2067-143536-0017 AS I WAS FORCED TO OWN TO MYSELF EVEN NOW IN THE SOBER LIGHT OF DAY SHE HERSELF HAD ATTRACTIONS THAT I COULD NOT FORGET NOT EVEN THE DREADFUL SIGHT WHICH I HAD WITNESSED DURING THE NIGHT COULD DRIVE THAT FOLLY FROM MY MIND AND ALAS THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO ADMIT IT
2067-143536-0018 IT HAS NOT BEEN DRIVEN THENCE TO THIS HOUR AFTER I HAD DRESSED MYSELF I PASSED INTO THE EATING OR RATHER EMBALMING CHAMBER AND HAD SOME FOOD WHICH WAS AS BEFORE BROUGHT TO ME BY THE GIRL MUTES WHEN I HAD FINISHED
2067-143536-0019 I WENT AND SAW POOR LEO WHO WAS QUITE OFF HIS HEAD AND DID NOT EVEN KNOW ME I ASKED USTANE HOW SHE THOUGHT HE WAS BUT SHE ONLY SHOOK HER HEAD AND BEGAN TO CRY A LITTLE EVIDENTLY HER HOPES WERE SMALL
2067-143536-0020 AND I THEN AND THERE MADE UP MY MIND THAT IF IT WERE IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE I WOULD GET SHE TO COME AND SEE HIM SURELY SHE WOULD CURE HIM IF SHE CHOSE AT ANY RATE SHE SAID SHE COULD WHILE I WAS IN THE ROOM BILLALI ENTERED AND ALSO SHOOK HIS HEAD
2067-143536-0021 HE WILL DIE AT NIGHT HE SAID GOD FORBID MY FATHER I ANSWERED AND TURNED AWAY WITH A HEAVY HEART SHE WHO MUST BE OBEYED COMMANDS THY PRESENCE MY BABOON SAID THE OLD MAN AS SOON AS WE GOT TO THE CURTAIN
2067-143536-0022 BUT OH MY DEAR SON BE MORE CAREFUL YESTERDAY I MADE SURE IN MY HEART THAT SHE WOULD BLAST THEE WHEN THOU DIDST NOT CRAWL UPON THY STOMACH BEFORE HER
2067-143536-0023 COME ON MY SON COME SWIFTLY I TURNED AND FOLLOWED HIM DOWN THE PASSAGE AND WHEN WE REACHED THE GREAT CENTRAL CAVE SAW THAT MANY AMAHAGGER SOME ROBED AND SOME MERELY CLAD IN THE SWEET SIMPLICITY OF A LEOPARD SKIN WERE HURRYING ALONG IT
2067-143536-0024 HOLLOWED IN THE ROCK BY THE PEOPLE WHO WERE BEFORE NOBODY VISITED THOSE TOMBS NOW HE SAID AND I MUST SAY THAT MY HEART REJOICED WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE OPPORTUNITIES OF ANTIQUARIAN RESEARCH WHICH OPENED OUT BEFORE ME AT LAST WE CAME TO THE HEAD OF THE CAVE
2067-143536-0025 A FACT THAT PROVED TO ME THAT THESE DAIS MUST HAVE BEEN USED AS ALTARS PROBABLY FOR THE CELEBRATION OF RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES AND MORE ESPECIALLY OF RITES CONNECTED WITH THE INTERMENT OF THE DEAD ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS DAIS WERE PASSAGES LEADING BILLALI INFORMED ME TO OTHER CAVES FULL OF DEAD BODIES
2067-143536-0026 INDEED HE ADDED THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN IS FULL OF DEAD AND NEARLY ALL OF THEM ARE PERFECT IN FRONT OF THE DAIS WERE GATHERED A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF BOTH SEXES WHO STOOD STARING ABOUT IN THEIR PECULIAR GLOOMY FASHION
2067-143536-0027 WHICH WOULD HAVE REDUCED MARK TAPLEY HIMSELF TO MISERY IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES ON THE DAIS WAS A RUDE CHAIR OF BLACK WOOD INLAID WITH IVORY HAVING A SEAT MADE OF GRASS FIBRE AND A FOOTSTOOL FORMED OF A WOODEN SLAB ATTACHED TO THE FRAMEWORK OF THE CHAIR
2067-143536-0028 AND THEREUPON THE ENTIRE CROWD OF SPECTATORS INSTANTLY PRECIPITATED ITSELF UPON THE GROUND AND LAY STILL AS THOUGH IT WERE INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY STRICKEN DEAD LEAVING ME STANDING THERE LIKE SOME SOLITARY SURVIVOR OF A MASSACRE
2067-143536-0029 AS IT DID SO A LONG STRING OF GUARDS BEGAN TO DEFILE FROM A PASSAGE TO THE LEFT AND RANGED THEMSELVES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE DAIS THEN FOLLOWED ABOUT A SCORE OF MALE MUTES THEN AS MANY WOMEN MUTES BEARING LAMPS AND THEN A TALL WHITE FIGURE
2067-143536-0030 IN WHOM I RECOGNISED SHE HERSELF SHE MOUNTED THE DAIS AND SAT DOWN UPON THE CHAIR AND SPOKE TO ME IN GREEK I SUPPOSE BECAUSE SHE DID NOT WISH THOSE PRESENT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE SAID COME HITHER OH HOLLY SHE SAID AND SIT THOU AT MY FEET
2067-143536-0031 AND SEE ME DO JUSTICE ON THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE SLAIN THEE FORGIVE ME IF MY GREEK DOTH HALT LIKE A LAME MAN IT IS SO LONG SINCE I HAVE HEARD THE SOUND OF IT THAT MY TONGUE IS STIFF AND WILL NOT BEND RIGHTLY TO THE WORDS I BOWED AND MOUNTING THE DAIS
2067-143536-0032 SAT DOWN AT HER FEET HOW HAST THOU SLEPT MY HOLLY SHE ASKED I SLEPT NOT WELL OH AYESHA I ANSWERED WITH PERFECT TRUTH AND WITH AN INWARD FEAR THAT PERHAPS SHE KNEW HOW I HAD PASSED THE HEART OF THE NIGHT SO
2067-143536-0033 SHE SAID WITH A LITTLE LAUGH I TOO HAVE NOT SLEPT WELL LAST NIGHT I HAD DREAMS AND METHINKS THAT THOU DIDST CALL THEM TO ME OH HOLLY OF WHAT DIDST THOU DREAM AYESHA I ASKED INDIFFERENTLY I DREAMED SHE ANSWERED QUICKLY
2067-143536-0034 OF ONE I HATE AND ONE I LOVE AND THEN AS THOUGH TO TURN THE CONVERSATION SHE ADDRESSED THE CAPTAIN OF HER GUARD IN ARABIC LET THE MEN BE BROUGHT BEFORE ME THE CAPTAIN BOWED LOW FOR THE GUARD AND HER ATTENDANTS DID NOT PROSTRATE THEMSELVES
2067-143536-0035 BUT HAD REMAINED STANDING AND DEPARTED WITH HIS UNDERLINGS DOWN A PASSAGE TO THE RIGHT THEN CAME A SILENCE
2067-143536-0036 AND APPEARED TO BE LOST IN THOUGHT WHILE THE MULTITUDE BEFORE HER CONTINUED TO GROVEL UPON THEIR STOMACHS
2067-143536-0037 IT SEEMED THAT THEIR QUEEN SO RARELY APPEARED IN PUBLIC THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO UNDERGO THIS INCONVENIENCE AND EVEN GRAVER RISKS
2067-143536-0038 BUT SHE STOPPED THEM NAY SHE SAID IN HER SOFTEST VOICE STAND I PRAY YOU STAND PERCHANCE THE TIME WILL SOON BE WHEN YE SHALL GROW WEARY OF BEING STRETCHED OUT AND SHE LAUGHED MELODIOUSLY
2067-143536-0039 I SAW A CRINGE OF TERROR RUN ALONG THE RANK OF THE DOOMED WRETCHES AND WICKED VILLAINS AS THEY WERE I FELT SORRY FOR THEM SOME MINUTES PERHAPS TWO OR THREE PASSED BEFORE ANYTHING FRESH OCCURRED DURING WHICH SHE APPEARED FROM THE MOVEMENT OF HER HEAD
2067-143536-0040 AY OH QUEEN NEARLY ALL OF THEM I SAID AND I SAW THEM GLOWER AT ME AS I SAID IT THEN TELL TO ME AND THIS GREAT COMPANY THE TALE WHEREOF I HAVE HEARD
2067-143536-0041 THUS ADJURED I IN AS FEW WORDS AS I COULD RELATED THE HISTORY OF THE CANNIBAL FEAST AND OF THE ATTEMPTED TORTURE OF OUR POOR SERVANT THE NARRATIVE WAS RECEIVED IN PERFECT SILENCE BOTH BY THE ACCUSED AND BY THE AUDIENCE
2067-143536-0042 AND ALSO BY SHE HERSELF WHEN I HAD DONE AYESHA CALLED UPON BILLALI BY NAME AND LIFTING HIS HEAD FROM THE GROUND BUT WITHOUT RISING THE OLD MAN CONFIRMED MY STORY NO FURTHER EVIDENCE WAS TAKEN
2067-143536-0043 YE HAVE HEARD SAID SHE AT LENGTH IN A COLD CLEAR VOICE VERY DIFFERENT FROM HER USUAL TONES INDEED IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE THINGS ABOUT THIS EXTRAORDINARY CREATURE
2067-143536-0044 THAT HER VOICE HAD THE POWER OF SUITING ITSELF IN A WONDERFUL MANNER TO THE MOOD OF THE MOMENT WHAT HAVE YE TO SAY YE REBELLIOUS CHILDREN WHY VENGEANCE SHOULD NOT BE DONE UPON YOU FOR SOME TIME THERE WAS NO ANSWER BUT AT LAST ONE OF THE MEN
2067-143536-0045 A FINE BROAD CHESTED FELLOW WELL ON IN MIDDLE LIFE WITH DEEP GRAVEN FEATURES AND AN EYE LIKE A HAWK'S SPOKE AND SAID THAT THE ORDERS THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED WERE NOT TO HARM THE WHITE MEN NOTHING WAS SAID OF THEIR BLACK SERVANT
2067-143536-0046 THEY PROCEEDED TO TRY TO HOT POT HIM AFTER THE ANCIENT AND HONOURABLE CUSTOM OF THEIR COUNTRY
2067-143536-0047 AS FOR THEIR SUDDEN ATTACK UPON OURSELVES IT WAS MADE IN AN ACCESS OF SUDDEN FURY AND THEY DEEPLY REGRETTED IT HE ENDED BY HUMBLY PRAYING THAT THEY MIGHT BE BANISHED INTO THE SWAMPS TO LIVE AND DIE AS IT MIGHT CHANCE
2067-143536-0048 BUT I SAW IT WRITTEN ON HIS FACE THAT HE HAD BUT LITTLE HOPE OF MERCY THEN CAME A PAUSE AND THE MOST INTENSE SILENCE REIGNED OVER THE WHOLE SCENE WHICH ILLUMINATED AS IT WAS BY THE FLICKER OF THE LAMPS STRIKING OUT BROAD PATTERNS OF LIGHT AND SHADOW UPON THE ROCKY WALLS
2067-143536-0049 WAS AS STRANGE AS ANY I EVER SAW EVEN IN THAT UNHOLY LAND UPON THE GROUND BEFORE THE DAIS WERE STRETCHED SCORES OF THE CORPSELIKE FORMS OF THE SPECTATORS TILL AT LAST THE LONG LINES OF THEM WERE LOST IN THE GLOOMY BACKGROUND
2067-143536-0050 AND MEN AND WOMEN MUTES WATCHING WITH HARD CURIOUS EYES THEN SEATED IN HER BARBARIC CHAIR ABOVE THEM ALL WITH MYSELF AT HER FEET WAS THE VEILED WHITE WOMAN WHOSE LOVELINESS AND AWESOME POWER SEEMED TO VISIBLY SHINE ABOUT HER LIKE A HALO
2067-143536-0051 OR RATHER LIKE THE GLOW FROM SOME UNSEEN LIGHT NEVER HAVE I SEEN HER VEILED SHAPE LOOK MORE TERRIBLE THAN IT DID IN THAT SPACE WHILE SHE GATHERED HERSELF UP FOR VENGEANCE AT LAST IT CAME
2067-143536-0052 DOGS AND SERPENTS SHE BEGAN IN A LOW VOICE THAT GRADUALLY GATHERED POWER AS SHE WENT ON TILL THE PLACE RANG WITH IT EATERS OF HUMAN FLESH TWO THINGS HAVE YE DONE
2067-143536-0053 FIRST YE HAVE ATTACKED THESE STRANGERS BEING WHITE MEN AND WOULD HAVE SLAIN THEIR SERVANT AND FOR THAT ALONE DEATH IS YOUR REWARD BUT THAT IS NOT ALL YE HAVE DARED TO DISOBEY ME
2067-143536-0054 DID I NOT SEND MY WORD UNTO YOU BY BILLALI MY SERVANT AND THE FATHER OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD DID I NOT BID YOU TO HOSPITABLY ENTERTAIN THESE STRANGERS WHOM NOW YE HAVE STRIVEN TO SLAY AND WHOM HAD NOT THEY BEEN BRAVE AND STRONG BEYOND THE STRENGTH OF MEN
2067-143536-0055 YE WOULD CRUELLY HAVE MURDERED HATH IT NOT BEEN TAUGHT TO YOU FROM CHILDHOOD THAT THE LAW OF SHE IS AN EVER FIXED LAW AND THAT HE WHO BREAKETH IT BY SO MUCH AS ONE JOT OR TITTLE SHALL PERISH AND IS NOT MY LIGHTEST WORD A LAW
2067-143536-0056 ACCORDING TO YOUR MINDS WELL DO YE KNOW IT YE WICKED ONES BUT YE ARE ALL EVIL EVIL TO THE CORE THE WICKEDNESS BUBBLES UP IN YOU LIKE A FOUNTAIN IN THE SPRING TIME WERE IT NOT FOR ME GENERATIONS SINCE HAD YE CEASED TO BE
2067-143536-0057 AND BEGGED HER TO SPARE THEM OR AT LEAST TO METE OUT THEIR FATE IN SOME LESS AWFUL WAY BUT SHE WAS HARD AS ADAMANT ABOUT IT MY HOLLY SHE SAID AGAIN SPEAKING IN GREEK WHICH TO TELL THE TRUTH ALTHOUGH I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED A BETTER SCHOLAR OF THE LANGUAGE THAN MOST MEN
2067-143536-0058 I FOUND IT RATHER DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW CHIEFLY BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE IN THE FALL OF THE ACCENT AYESHA OF COURSE TALKED WITH THE ACCENT OF HER CONTEMPORARIES WHEREAS WE HAVE ONLY TRADITION AND THE MODERN ACCENT TO GUIDE US AS TO THE EXACT PRONUNCIATION MY HOLLY IT CANNOT BE
2067-143536-0059 YOUR LIVES WOULD NOT BE SAFE AMONG THIS PEOPLE FOR A DAY THOU KNOWEST THEM NOT THEY ARE TIGERS TO LAP BLOOD AND EVEN NOW THEY HUNGER FOR YOUR LIVES HOW THINKEST THOU THAT I RULE THIS PEOPLE I HAVE BUT A REGIMENT OF GUARDS TO DO MY BIDDING
2067-143536-0060 THEREFORE IT IS NOT BY FORCE IT IS BY TERROR MY EMPIRE IS OF THE IMAGINATION ONCE IN A GENERATION MAYHAP I DO AS I HAVE DONE BUT NOW AND SLAY A SCORE BY TORTURE BELIEVE NOT THAT I WOULD BE CRUEL
2067-143536-0061 OR TAKE VENGEANCE ON ANYTHING SO LOW WHAT CAN IT PROFIT ME TO BE AVENGED ON SUCH AS THESE THOSE WHO LIVE LONG MY HOLLY HAVE NO PASSIONS SAVE WHERE THEY HAVE INTERESTS THOUGH I MAY SEEM TO SLAY IN WRATH OR BECAUSE MY MOOD IS CROSSED
2067-143536-0062 IT IS NOT SO THOU HAST SEEN HOW IN THE HEAVENS THE LITTLE CLOUDS BLOW THIS WAY AND THAT WITHOUT A CAUSE YET BEHIND THEM IS THE GREAT WIND SWEEPING ON ITS PATH WHITHER IT LISTETH SO IT IS WITH ME OH HOLLY MY MOODS AND CHANGES ARE THE LITTLE CLOUDS
2067-143536-0063 AND FITFULLY THESE SEEM TO TURN BUT BEHIND THEM EVER BLOWS THE GREAT WIND OF MY PURPOSE NAY THE MEN MUST DIE AND DIE AS I HAVE SAID THEN SUDDENLY TURNING TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD
