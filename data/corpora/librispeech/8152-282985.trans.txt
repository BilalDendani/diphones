8152-282985-0000 CHAPTER FOUR THE SPIRIT OF FEAR WHEN THE DAYS GROW COLD AND THE NIGHTS ARE CLEAR THERE STALKS ABROAD THE SPIRIT OF FEAR LIGHTFOOT THE DEER
8152-282985-0001 IT IS SAD BUT TRUE AUTUMN IS OFTEN CALLED THE SAD TIME OF THE YEAR AND IT IS THE SAD TIME BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE OLD MOTHER NATURE NEVER INTENDED THAT IT SHOULD BE SHE MEANT IT TO BE THE GLAD TIME
8152-282985-0002 IT IS THE TIME WHEN ALL THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE GREEN FOREST AND THE GREEN MEADOWS HAVE GOT OVER THE CARES AND WORRIES OF BRINGING UP FAMILIES AND TEACHING THEIR CHILDREN HOW TO LOOK OUT FOR THEMSELVES IT IS THE SEASON WHEN FOOD IS PLENTIFUL AND EVERY ONE IS FAT AND IS
8152-282985-0003 BUT INSTEAD OF THIS A GRIM DARK FIGURE GOES STALKING OVER THE GREEN MEADOWS AND THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST AND IT IS CALLED THE SPIRIT OF FEAR
8152-282985-0004 IT PEERS INTO EVERY HIDING PLACE AND WHEREVER IT FINDS ONE OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE IT SENDS LITTLE COLD CHILLS OVER HIM LITTLE CHILLS WHICH JOLLY ROUND BRIGHT MISTER SUN CANNOT CHASE AWAY THOUGH HE SHINE HIS BRIGHTEST
8152-282985-0005 ALL NIGHT AS WELL AS ALL DAY THE SPIRIT OF FEAR SEARCHES OUT THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE GREEN MEADOWS AND THE GREEN FOREST IT WILL NOT LET THEM SLEEP IT WILL NOT LET THEM EAT IN PEACE IT DRIVES THEM TO SEEK NEW HIDING PLACES AND THEN DRIVES THEM OUT OF THOSE
8152-282985-0006 IT KEEPS THEM EVER READY TO FLY OR RUN AT THE SLIGHTEST SOUND PETER RABBIT WAS THINKING OF THIS AS HE SAT AT THE EDGE OF THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH LOOKING OVER TO THE GREEN FOREST THE GREEN FOREST WAS NO LONGER JUST GREEN
8152-282985-0007 IT WAS OF MANY COLORS FOR OLD MOTHER NATURE HAD SET JACK FROST TO PAINTING THE LEAVES OF THE MAPLE TREES AND THE BEECH TREES AND THE BIRCH TREES AND THE POPLAR TREES AND THE CHESTNUT TREES AND HE HAD DONE HIS WORK WELL
8152-282985-0008 VERY VERY LOVELY WERE THE REDS AND YELLOWS AND BROWNS AGAINST THE DARK GREEN OF THE PINES AND THE SPRUCES AND THE HEMLOCKS THE PURPLE HILLS WERE MORE SOFTLY PURPLE THAN AT ANY OTHER SEASON OF THE YEAR
8152-282985-0009 IT WAS ALL VERY VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT PETER HAD NO THOUGHT FOR THE BEAUTY OF IT ALL FOR THE SPIRIT OF FEAR HAD VISITED EVEN THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH AND PETER WAS AFRAID
8152-282985-0010 IT WASN'T FEAR OF REDDY FOX OR REDTAIL THE HAWK OR HOOTY THE OWL OR OLD MAN COYOTE THEY WERE FOREVER TRYING TO CATCH HIM BUT THEY DID NOT STRIKE TERROR TO HIS HEART BECAUSE HE FELT QUITE SMART ENOUGH TO KEEP OUT OF THEIR CLUTCHES
8152-282985-0011 TO BE SURE THEY GAVE HIM SUDDEN FRIGHTS SOMETIMES WHEN THEY HAPPENED TO SURPRISE HIM BUT THESE FRIGHTS LASTED ONLY UNTIL HE REACHED THE NEAREST BRAMBLE TANGLE OR HOLLOW LOG WHERE THEY COULD NOT GET AT HIM
8152-282985-0012 BUT THE FEAR THAT CHILLED HIS HEART NOW NEVER LEFT HIM EVEN FOR A MOMENT AND PETER KNEW THAT THIS SAME FEAR WAS CLUTCHING AT THE HEARTS OF BOB WHITE HIDING IN THE BROWN STUBBLE OF MISSUS GROUSE SQUATTING IN THE THICKEST BRAMBLE TANGLE IN THE GREEN FOREST
8152-282985-0013 OF UNCLE BILLY POSSUM AND BOBBY COON IN THEIR HOLLOW TREES OF JERRY MUSKRAT IN THE SMILING POOL OF HAPPY JACK SQUIRREL HIDING IN THE TREE TOPS OF LIGHTFOOT THE DEER LYING IN THE CLOSEST THICKET HE COULD FIND
8152-282985-0014 IT WAS EVEN CLUTCHING AT THE HEARTS OF GRANNY AND REDDY FOX AND OF GREAT BIG BUSTER BEAR IT SEEMED TO PETER THAT NO ONE WAS SO BIG OR SO SMALL THAT THIS TERRIBLE SPIRIT OF FEAR HAD NOT SEARCHED HIM OUT
8152-282985-0015 FAR IN THE DISTANCE SOUNDED A SUDDEN BANG PETER JUMPED AND SHIVERED HE KNEW THAT EVERY ONE ELSE WHO HAD HEARD THAT BANG HAD JUMPED AND SHIVERED JUST AS HE HAD IT WAS THE SEASON OF HUNTERS WITH TERRIBLE GUNS
8152-282985-0016 IT WAS MAN WHO HAD SENT THIS TERRIBLE SPIRIT OF FEAR TO CHILL THE HEARTS OF THE LITTLE MEADOW AND FOREST PEOPLE AT THIS VERY TIME WHEN OLD MOTHER NATURE HAD MADE ALL THINGS SO BEAUTIFUL
8152-282985-0017 AND HAD INTENDED THAT THEY SHOULD BE HAPPIEST AND MOST FREE FROM CARE AND WORRY IT WAS MAN WHO HAD MADE THE AUTUMN A SAD TIME INSTEAD OF A GLAD TIME THE VERY SADDEST TIME OF ALL THE YEAR
8152-282985-0018 WHEN OLD MOTHER NATURE HAD DONE HER BEST TO MAKE IT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL I DON'T UNDERSTAND THESE MEN CREATURES SAID PETER TO LITTLE MISSUS PETER AS THEY STARED FEARFULLY OUT FROM THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH
8152-282985-0019 THEY SEEM TO FIND PLEASURE ACTUALLY FIND PLEASURE IN TRYING TO KILL US I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM AT ALL THEY HAVEN'T ANY HEARTS
