7143-88749-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT THE SUN WAS LOW DOWN IN THE WEST AND SHINING THROUGH AND UNDER THE GREAT OAK AND BEECH TREES SO THAT EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE TURNED TO ORANGE AND GOLD IT WAS THE OUTLAWS SUPPER TIME
7143-88749-0001 THE SUN BEING THEIR CLOCK IN THE FOREST AND THE MEN WERE GATHERING TOGETHER TO ENJOY THEIR SECOND GREAT MEAL OF THE DAY THE OTHER BEING BREAKFAST AFTER HAVING WHICH THEY ALWAYS SEPARATED TO GO HUNTING THROUGH THE WOODS TO BRING IN THE PROVISIONS FOR THE NEXT DAY
7143-88749-0002 ROBIN HOOD'S MEN THEN WERE SCATTERED ABOUT UNDER THE SHADE OF A HUGE SPREADING OAK TREE WAITING FOR THE ROAST VENISON WHICH SENT A VERY PLEASANT ODOR FROM THE GLOWING FIRE OF OAK WOOD
7143-88749-0003 LITTLE JOHN WAS THERE LYING DOWN SMILING AND CONTENTED AFTER A HARD DAY'S HUNTING LISTENING TO YOUNG ROBIN WHO WAS DISPLAYING THE TREASURES HE HAD BROUGHT IN THAT DAY AND TELLING HIS GREAT COMPANION WHERE HE HAD FOUND THEM
7143-88749-0004 THERE WERE FLOWERS FOR MAID MARIAN BECAUSE SHE WAS FOND OF THE PURPLE AND YELLOW LOOSESTRIFE AND LONG THICK REEDS IN A BUNDLE YOU CAN MAKE ME SOME ARROWS OF THOSE SAID ROBIN AND I'VE FOUND A YOUNG YEW TREE WITH A BOUGH QUITE STRAIGHT
7143-88749-0005 YOU MUST CUT THAT DOWN AND DRY IT TO MAKE ME A BIGGER BOW THIS ONE IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH VERY WELL BIG ONE SAID LITTLE JOHN SMILING AND STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO SMOOTH THE BOY'S CURLY BROWN HAIR ANYTHING ELSE FOR ME TO DO OH YES LOTS OF THINGS
7143-88749-0006 ONLY I CAN'T THINK OF THEM YET LOOK HERE I FOUND THESE THE BOY TOOK SOME ROUND PRICKLY HUSKS OUT OF HIS POCKET CHESTNUTS EATING ONES

7143-88749-0009 AND THEN THE PIGS GET THEM SAID ROBIN THEN YOU MUST GET UP BEFORE THE PIGS AND BE FIRST HALLOA WHAT NOW FOR A HORN WAS BLOWN AT A DISTANCE AND THE MEN UNDER THE GREAT OAK TREE SPRANG TO THEIR FEET
7143-88749-0010 WHILE ROBIN HOOD CAME OUT TO SEE WHAT THE SIGNAL MEANT YOUNG ROBIN WHO WAS NOW QUITE ACCUSTOMED TO THE FORESTERS WAYS CAUGHT UP HIS BOW LIKE THE REST AND STOOD LOOKING EAGERLY IN THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE CHEERY SOUNDING NOTES OF THE HORN WERE BLOWN HE HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT
7143-88749-0011 FOR HALF A DOZEN OF THE MERRY MEN IN GREEN CAME MARCHING TOWARDS THEM WITH A COUPLE OF PRISONERS EACH HAVING HIS HANDS FASTENED BEHIND HIM WITH A BOW STRING AND A BROAD BANDAGE TIED OVER HIS EYES SO THAT THEY SHOULD NOT KNOW THEIR WAY AGAIN TO THE OUTLAWS STRONGHOLD
7143-88749-0012 PRISONERS SAID YOUNG ROBIN POOR MEN TOO GRUMBLED LITTLE JOHN THEN YOU'LL GIVE THEM THEIR SUPPER AND SEND THEM AWAY TO MORROW MORNING SAID YOUNG ROBIN I SUPPOSE SO SAID LITTLE JOHN
7143-88749-0013 BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE OUR FELLOWS BRING THEM IN LET'S GO AND SEE SAID YOUNG ROBIN LITTLE JOHN FOLLOWED AS THE BOY MARCHED OFF BOW IN HAND TO WHERE ROBIN HOOD WAS STANDING WAITING TO HEAR WHAT HIS MEN HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE PRISONERS THEY HAD BROUGHT IN
7143-88749-0014 AND AS THEY DREW NEAR THE BOY SAW THAT ONE WAS A HOMELY POOR LOOKING MAN WITH ROUND SHOULDERS THE OTHER WELL DRESSED IN SAD COLORED CLOTHES AND THIN AND BENT BUT THE BOY COULD SEE LITTLE MORE FOR THE BROAD BANDAGE
7143-88749-0015 WHICH NEARLY COVERED THE PRISONER'S FACE AND WAS TIED TIGHTLY BEHIND OVER HIS LONG GRAY HAIR WHILE HIS GRAY BEARD HUNG DOWN LOW YOUNG ROBIN LOOKED PITYINGLY AT THIS PRISONER AND A LONGING CAME OVER HIM TO LOOSEN THE THONG WHICH TIED HIS HANDS TIGHTLY BEHIND HIM
7143-88749-0016 BUT JUST THEN ROBIN HOOD CRIED
7143-88749-0017 THE BOWED DOWN GRAY HAIRED PRISONER ROSE ERECT AT THIS AND CRIED IS THAT ROBIN HOOD WHO SPEAKS BEFORE THE OUTLAW COULD ANSWER HE WAS STOPPED BY A CRY FROM THE BOY
7143-88749-0018 AS HE REACHED UP TO TEAR THE BANDAGE FROM THE FACE BENDING OVER HIM AND THEN DARTED ROUND TO BEGIN SAWING AT THE THONG WHICH HELD HIS FATHER'S HANDS LITTLE JOHN TOOK A STEP OR TWO FORWARD TO HELP THE BOY BUT ROBIN HOOD HELD UP HIS HAND TO KEEP HIM BACK
7143-88749-0019 AND A DEAD SILENCE FELL UPON THE GREAT GROUP OF FORESTERS WHO HAD PRESSED FORWARD AND WHO EAGERLY WATCHED THE SCENE BEFORE THEM IN THE SOFT AMBER SUNSHINE WHICH CAME SLANTING THROUGH THE TREES
7143-88749-0020 AND MANY MOMENTS HAD NOT ELAPSED BEFORE THE PRISONER'S HANDS WERE FREE AND AS IF SEEING NO ONE BUT THE LITTLE FORESTER BEFORE HIM IN GREEN AND QUITE REGARDLESS OF ALL AROUND HE DROPPED UPON HIS KNEES CLASPED THE BOY TO HIS BREAST AND SOFTLY WHISPERED THE WORDS THANK GOD
7143-88749-0021 YOUNG ROBIN'S ARMS WERE TIGHTLY ROUND HIS FATHER'S NECK BY THIS TIME AND HE WAS KISSING THE CARE WORN FACE AGAIN AND AGAIN THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE FATHER THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE CRIED THE BOY PASSIONATELY

7143-88749-0039 FATE MADE ME WHAT I AM THE SHERIFF'S ENEMY BUT THE GENTLE VISITOR'S FRIEND COME ROB MY BOY SHOW YOUR FATHER WHERE HE CAN TAKE AWAY THE TRAVEL STAINS AND THEN BRING HIM TO OUR HUMBLE BOARD
7143-88749-0040 AND ALL WERE GATHERED TOGETHER TO BID HIM FAREWELL AND SEE HIM SAFELY WITH HIS FATHER ON THE ROAD BUT NOT AS THE SHERIFF HAD COME WEARILY AND ON FOOT FOR HALF A DOZEN OF THE BEST MULES WERE FORTHCOMING AND THE GUESTS WERE TO RIDE BACK ON THEIR JOURNEY HOME
7143-88749-0041 WHO DOES NOT KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO SAY GOOD BYE YOUNG ROBIN DID NOT TILL THE TIME HAD COME HE AWOKE THAT MORNING JOYFUL AND EAGER TO START FOR IT WAS TO GO BACK HOME IN COMPANY WITH THE FATHER WHOM HE LOVED
7143-88749-0042 BUT WHEN THE TIME CAME HE HAD TO LEARN HOW TIGHTLY SO MANY OF HIS LITTLE HEARTSTRINGS HAD TAKEN HOLD OF THE LIFE UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM HAD GROWN DEAR AND THERE WAS ALMOST A MULE LOAD OF TREASURES AND PETS OF HIS OWN COLLECTING THAT COULD NOT BE LEFT BEHIND
7143-88749-0043 AND WHEN THEY HAD BEEN CAREFULLY PACKED IN PANNIERS BY LITTLE JOHN AND ONE OF THE MEN THERE WAS THE TASK OF BIDDING THEM ALL GOOD BYE AND THEN THOSE TWO WORDS GREW HARDER EVERY TIME BUT HE SPOKE OUT MANFULLY AND WELL IN SPITE OF A CHOKING SENSATION TILL NEARLY THE LAST
7143-88749-0044 AND YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF MY PET FAWN FOR ME LITTLE JOHN AND ALWAYS REMEMBER TO FEED IT WELL AND DON'T FORGET THE DOG AND THAT DORMOUSE WE COULDN'T FIND SO THAT I CAN HAVE IT WHEN I COME BACK AND CROAK
7143-88749-0045 WHAT WAS THAT IT WAS A PECULIAR SOUND MADE UP IN THE AIR BY LITTLE JOHN AND THAT DID IT FOR WHEN YOUNG ROBIN LOOKED UP IN ASTONISHMENT IT WAS TO SEE THE GREAT FELLOW'S FACE ALL PUCKERED UP AND YES
7143-88749-0046 THERE WERE TWO GREAT TEARS ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS AS HE CAUGHT THE BOY IN HIS ARMS AND KISSED HIM AND SO IT WAS THAT WHEN YOUNG ROBIN RAN TO BID MAID MARIAN GOOD BYE HE COULD NO LONGER HOLD IT BACK
7143-88749-0047 AS HE CLASPED HIS ARMS ABOUT HER NECK AND KISSED HER PASSIONATELY AGAIN AND AGAIN THE SOBS CAME FAST BUT THE WORD GOOD BYE WOULD NOT COME AT ALL AND WHEN THEY RODE AWAY THE BOY DARED NOT LOOK BACK FOR FEAR THE MEN SHOULD SEE HIS RED AND SWOLLEN EYES
7143-88749-0048 SO HE ONLY WAVED HIS HAT AND KEPT WAVING IT TO THE LAST BUT HE WAS TO SEE SOME OF HIS FRIENDS AGAIN FOR ABOUT A YEAR AFTER THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM HAD THE STRANGEST VISITORS OF HIS LIFE TIME AT HIS HOUSE AND YOUNG ROBIN ENJOYED THE TASK OF WELCOMING THEM
7143-88749-0049 FOR AS ONE OLD HISTORY SAYS ROBIN HOOD WAS FORGIVEN AND RESTORED BY THE KING TO HIS RIGHTFUL POSSESSIONS AND THEN IT WAS THAT HE WAS GLADLY WELCOMED BY THE SHERIFF WHO SAID HE WAS HONORED BY THE VISIT OF THE NOBLEMAN AND HIS LADY
7143-88749-0050 THEY WERE STILL ROBIN HOOD AND MAID MARIAN TO HIM
