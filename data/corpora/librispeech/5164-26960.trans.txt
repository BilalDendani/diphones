5164-26960-0000 AS THERE WOULD BE AGENTS COMING TO PACK UP THE ANTIQUITIES THEN LEANING TO KISS HER ON THE BROW
5164-26960-0001 WHERE THE LITTLE PAINTED TABERNACLE WAS AND WHERE SHE WAS THEN SITTING SO THAT SHE MIGHT BE AWAY FROM THE NOISE OF STRANGE FOOTSTEPS ROMOLA ASSENTED QUIETLY
5164-26960-0002 THE NIGHT HAD BEEN ONE LONG WAKING TO HER AND IN SPITE OF HER HEALTHY FRAME SENSATION HAD BECOME A DULL CONTINUOUS PAIN AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STUNNED AND BRUISED TITO DIVINED THAT SHE FELT ILL BUT HE DARED SAY NO MORE
5164-26960-0003 HE ONLY DARED PERCEIVING THAT HER HAND AND BROW WERE STONE COLD TO FETCH A FURRED MANTLE AND THROW IT LIGHTLY ROUND HER AND IN EVERY BRIEF INTERVAL THAT HE RETURNED TO HER THE SCENE WAS NEARLY THE SAME
5164-26960-0004 OR OF LOOKING AT HIM PATIENCE HE SAID TO HIMSELF SHE WILL RECOVER IT AND FORGIVE AT LAST
5164-26960-0005 WHEN THE STRICKEN PERSON IS SLOW TO RECOVER AND LOOK AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED THE STRIKER EASILY GLIDES INTO THE POSITION OF THE AGGRIEVED PARTY HE FEELS NO BRUISE HIMSELF AND IS STRONGLY CONSCIOUS OF HIS OWN AMIABLE BEHAVIOUR
5164-26960-0006 SINCE HE INFLICTED THE BLOW BUT TITO WAS NOT NATURALLY DISPOSED TO FEEL HIMSELF AGGRIEVED THE CONSTANT BENT OF HIS MIND WAS TOWARDS PROPITIATION
5164-26960-0007 OF FEELING ROMOLA'S HAND RESTING ON HIS HEAD AGAIN AS IT DID THAT MORNING WHEN HE FIRST SHRANK FROM LOOKING AT HER
5164-26960-0008 BECAUSE HIS LIFE OUT OF DOORS WAS MORE AND MORE INTERESTING TO HIM A COURSE OF ACTION WHICH IS IN STRICTNESS A SLOWLY PREPARED OUTGROWTH OF THE ENTIRE CHARACTER
5164-26960-0009 AS ITS POINT OF APPARENT ORIGIN AND SINCE THAT MOMENT IN THE PIAZZA DEL DUOMO WHEN TITO MOUNTED ON THE BALES HAD TASTED A KEEN PLEASURE IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS ABILITY TO TICKLE THE EARS OF MEN WITH ANY PHRASES THAT PLEASED THEM
5164-26960-0010 HIS IMAGINATION HAD GLANCED CONTINUALLY TOWARDS A SORT OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY WHICH THE TROUBLED PUBLIC LIFE OF FLORENCE WAS LIKELY ENOUGH TO FIND OCCASION FOR BUT THE FRESH DREAD OF BALDASSARRE
5164-26960-0011 WAKED IN THE SAME MOMENT HAD LAIN LIKE AN IMMOVABLE ROCKY OBSTRUCTION ACROSS THAT PATH AND HAD URGED HIM INTO THE SALE OF THE LIBRARY AS A PREPARATION FOR THE POSSIBLE NECESSITY OF LEAVING FLORENCE
5164-26960-0012 AT THE VERY TIME WHEN HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL THAT IT HAD A NEW ATTRACTION FOR HIM THAT DREAD WAS NEARLY REMOVED NOW HE MUST WEAR HIS ARMOUR STILL
5164-26960-0013 BUT HE DID NOT FEEL OBLIGED TO TAKE THE INCONVENIENT STEP OF LEAVING FLORENCE AND SEEKING NEW FORTUNES HIS FATHER HAD REFUSED THE OFFERED ATONEMENT HAD FORCED HIM INTO DEFIANCE AND AN OLD MAN
5164-26960-0014 IN A STRANGE PLACE WITH HIS MEMORY GONE WAS WEAK ENOUGH TO BE DEFIED TITO'S IMPLICIT DESIRES WERE WORKING THEMSELVES OUT NOW IN VERY EXPLICIT THOUGHTS AS THE FRESHNESS OF YOUNG PASSION FADED
5164-26960-0015 LIFE WAS TAKING MORE AND MORE DECIDEDLY FOR HIM THE ASPECT OF A GAME IN WHICH THERE WAS AN AGREEABLE MINGLING OF SKILL AND CHANCE AND THE GAME THAT MIGHT BE PLAYED IN FLORENCE PROMISED TO BE RAPID AND EXCITING IT WAS A GAME OF REVOLUTIONARY AND PARTY STRUGGLE
5164-26960-0016 SURE TO INCLUDE PLENTY OF THAT UNAVOWED ACTION IN WHICH BRILLIANT INGENUITY ABLE TO GET RID OF ALL INCONVENIENT BELIEFS EXCEPT THAT GINGER IS HOT IN THE MOUTH IS APT TO SEE THE PATH OF SUPERIOR WISDOM
5164-26960-0017 NO SOONER WERE THE FRENCH GUESTS GONE THAN FLORENCE WAS AS AGITATED AS A COLONY OF ANTS WHEN AN ALARMING SHADOW HAS BEEN REMOVED AND THE CAMP HAS TO BE REPAIRED
5164-26960-0018 TILL THOSE QUESTIONS WERE WELL ANSWERED TRADE WAS IN DANGER OF STANDING STILL AND THAT LARGE BODY OF THE WORKING MEN WHO WERE NOT COUNTED AS CITIZENS AND HAD NOT SO MUCH AS A VOTE TO SERVE AS AN ANODYNE TO THEIR STOMACHS WERE LIKELY TO GET IMPATIENT
5164-26960-0019 SOMETHING MUST BE DONE AND FIRST THE GREAT BELL WAS SOUNDED
5164-26960-0020 CAME OUT AND STOOD BY THE STONE LION ON THE PLATFORM IN FRONT OF THE OLD PALACE AND PROPOSED THAT TWENTY CHIEF MEN OF THE CITY
5164-26960-0021 BUT NOT SO THE DEBATING INSIDE THE PALACE
5164-26960-0022 WHERE ALL THE OFFICERS OF GOVERNMENT MIGHT BE ELECTED
5164-26960-0023 WITHOUT QUESTION OF RANK OR PARTY
5164-26960-0024 IN WHICH THE HEREDITARY INFLUENCE OF GOOD FAMILIES WOULD BE LESS ADULTERATED WITH THE VOTES OF SHOPKEEPERS DOCTORS OF LAW DISPUTED DAY AFTER DAY AND FAR ON INTO THE NIGHT
5164-26960-0025 IT WAS A QUESTION OF BOILED OR ROAST WHICH HAD BEEN PREJUDGED BY THE PALATES OF THE DISPUTANTS
5164-26960-0026 THE MAJORITY OF THE MEN INSIDE THE PALACE HAVING POWER ALREADY IN THEIR HANDS AGREED WITH VESPUCCI
5164-26960-0027 WERE LESS AFRAID OF CHANGE AND THERE WAS A FORCE OUTSIDE THE PALACE
5164-26960-0028 THAT FORCE WAS THE PREACHING OF SAVONAROLA IMPELLED PARTLY BY THE SPIRITUAL NECESSITY THAT WAS LAID UPON HIM TO GUIDE THE PEOPLE AND PARTLY BY THE PROMPTING OF PUBLIC MEN WHO COULD GET NO MEASURES CARRIED WITHOUT HIS AID
5164-26960-0029 HE WAS RAPIDLY PASSING IN HIS DAILY SERMONS FROM THE GENERAL TO THE SPECIAL FROM TELLING HIS HEARERS THAT THEY MUST POSTPONE THEIR PRIVATE PASSIONS AND INTERESTS TO THE PUBLIC GOOD
5164-26960-0030 TO TELLING THEM PRECISELY WHAT SORT OF GOVERNMENT THEY MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO PROMOTE THAT GOOD FROM
5164-26960-0031 TO CHOOSE THE GREAT COUNCIL AND THE GREAT COUNCIL IS THE WILL OF GOD TO SAVONAROLA THESE WERE AS GOOD AS IDENTICAL PROPOSITIONS THE GREAT COUNCIL WAS THE ONLY PRACTICABLE PLAN
5164-26960-0032 AND THE PURER THE GOVERNMENT OF FLORENCE WOULD BECOME THE MORE SECURE FROM THE DESIGNS OF MEN WHO SAW THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE IN THE MORAL DEBASEMENT OF THEIR FELLOWS THE NEARER WOULD THE FLORENTINE PEOPLE APPROACH THE CHARACTER OF A PURE COMMUNITY
5164-26960-0033 WORTHY TO LEAD THE WAY IN THE RENOVATION OF THE CHURCH AND THE WORLD
5164-26960-0034 HE HAD NO PRIVATE MALICE HE SOUGHT NO PETTY GRATIFICATION
