75-853-0000 IT WAS A BITTERLY COLD NIGHT IN THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER THIRTEEN THIRTY THE RAIN WAS POURING HEAVILY WHEN A WOMAN
75-853-0001 SHE HAD EVIDENTLY COME FROM A DISTANCE
75-853-0002 SHE LEANT AGAINST THE WALL WITH A FAINT GROAN OF EXHAUSTION AND DISAPPOINTMENT

75-853-0010 UNTIL SHE RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN GEOFFREY WARD RETURNED THE WOMAN WAS SITTING IN A SETTLE BY THE FIRESIDE DRESSED IN A WARM WOOLEN GARMENT BELONGING TO HIS SISTER MADGE HAD THROWN FRESH WOOD ON THE FIRE WHICH WAS BLAZING BRIGHTLY NOW
75-853-0011 THE WOMAN DRANK THE STEAMING BEVERAGE WHICH HER HOST BROUGHT WITH HIM
75-853-0012 I THANK YOU INDEED SHE SAID FOR YOUR KINDNESS HAD YOU NOT TAKEN ME IN I THINK I WOULD HAVE DIED AT YOUR DOOR FOR INDEED I COULD GO NO FURTHER AND THOUGH I HOLD NOT TO LIFE YET WOULD I FAIN LIVE UNTIL I HAVE DELIVERED MY BOY

75-853-0014 TO A FELLOW CREATURE ON SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT FELLOW CREATURE IS A WOMAN WITH A CHILD POOR LITTLE CHAP HE LOOKS RIGHT WELL AND STURDY AND SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN NO ILL FROM HIS JOURNEY
75-853-0015 TRULY HE IS WELL AND STURDY THE MOTHER SAID LOOKING AT HIM PROUDLY INDEED I HAVE BEEN ALMOST WISHING TODAY THAT HE WERE LIGHTER BY A FEW POUNDS
75-853-0016 AND HIS WEIGHT HAS SORELY TRIED ME HIS NAME IS WALTER AND I TRUST SHE ADDED LOOKING AT THE POWERFUL FIGURE OF HER HOST THAT HE WILL GROW UP AS STRAIGHT AND AS STALWART AS YOURSELF
75-853-0017 THE CHILD WHO WAS ABOUT THREE YEARS OLD WAS INDEED AN EXCEEDINGLY FINE LITTLE FELLOW AS HE SAT IN ONE SCANTY GARMENT IN HIS MOTHER'S LAP
75-853-0018 THE CHILD AND MOTHER MADE SHE WAS A FAIR GENTLE LOOKING GIRL SOME TWO AND TWENTY YEARS OLD AND IT WAS EASY ENOUGH TO SEE NOW FROM HER DELICATE FEATURES AND SOFT SHAPELY HANDS THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO TOIL AND NOW THE SMITH SAID
75-853-0019 THE HOUR IS LATE AND I SHALL BE HAVING THE WATCH COMING ALONG TO KNOW WHY I KEEP A FIRE SO LONG AFTER THE CURFEW SHOULD YOU BE A STRANGER IN THE CITY
75-853-0020 TO THE FRIENDS WHOM YOU SEEK THAT IS SHOULD THEY BE KNOWN TO ME BUT IF NOT WE SHALL DOUBTLESS FIND THEM WITHOUT DIFFICULTY SO SAYING THE SMITH RETIRED TO HIS BED OF RUSHES IN THE SMITHY AND SOON AFTERWARDS THE TIRED VISITOR WITH HER BABY
75-853-0021 LAY DOWN ON THE RUSHES IN FRONT OF THE FIRE FOR IN THOSE DAYS NONE OF THE WORKING OR ARTISAN CLASS USED BEDS WHICH WERE NOT INDEED FOR CENTURIES AFTERWARDS IN USAGE BY THE COMMON PEOPLE IN THE MORNING GEOFFREY WARD
75-853-0022 FOUND THAT HIS GUEST DESIRED TO FIND ONE GILES FLETCHER A MAKER OF BOWS I KNOW HIM WELL THE SMITH SAID THERE ARE MANY WHO DO A LARGER BUSINESS AND HOLD THEIR HEADS HIGHER BUT GILES FLETCHER IS WELL ESTEEMED AS A GOOD WORKMAN WHOSE WARES CAN BE DEPENDED UPON IT IS OFTEN SAID OF HIM
75-853-0023 THAT DID HE TAKE LESS PAINS HE WOULD THRIVE MORE BUT HE HANDLES EACH BOW THAT HE MAKES AS IF HE LOVED IT AND FINISHES AND POLISHES EACH WITH HIS OWN HAND THEREFORE HE DOETH NOT SO MUCH TRADE AS THOSE WHO ARE LESS PARTICULAR WITH THEIR WARES
75-853-0024 BUT NONE WHO HAVE EVER BOUGHT HIS BOWS HAVE REGRETTED THE SILVER WHICH THEY COST MANY AND MANY A GROSS OF ARROWHEADS HAVE I SOLD HIM
75-853-0025 MANY A FRIENDLY WRANGLE HAVE I HAD WITH HIM
75-853-0026 AND NOW MADAM I AM AT YOUR SERVICE DURING THE NIGHT THE WAYFARER'S CLOTHES HAD BEEN DRIED THE CLOAK WAS OF ROUGH QUALITY SUCH AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN USED BY A PEASANT WOMAN BUT THE REST THOUGH OF SOMBRE COLOUR WERE OF GOOD MATERIAL AND FASHION
75-853-0027 SEEING THAT HER KIND ENTERTAINERS WOULD BE HURT BY THE OFFER OF MONEY THE LADY CONTENTED HERSELF WITH THANKING MADGE WARMLY
75-853-0028 WITH DAME FLETCHER THEN UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF GEOFFREY WHO INSISTED ON CARRYING THE BOY SHE SET OUT FROM THE SMITH'S COTTAGE THEY PASSED UNDER THE OUTER GATE AND ACROSS THE BRIDGE WHICH LATER ON WAS COVERED WITH A DOUBLE LINE OF HOUSES AND SHOPS
75-853-0029 BUT WAS NOW A NARROW STRUCTURE OVER THE GATEWAY ACROSS THE RIVER UPON PIKES WERE A NUMBER OF HEADS AND HUMAN LIMBS THE LADY SHUDDERED AS SHE LOOKED UP
75-853-0030 WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE KING'S GRANDFATHER SOME TWENTY YEARS BACK BUT AFTER ALL THEY FOUGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY
75-853-0031 THAT MEN WHO HAVE DONE NO OTHER HARM SHOULD BE BEHEADED STILL LESS THAT THEIR HEADS AND LIMBS SHOULD BE STUCK UP THERE GIBBERING AT ALL PASSERS BY THERE ARE OVER A SCORE OF THEM AND EVERY FRESH TROUBLE ADDS TO THEIR NUMBER BUT PARDON ME
75-853-0032 HE SAID SUDDENLY AS A SOB FROM THE FIGURE BY HIS SIDE
75-853-0033 I AM ROUGH AND HEEDLESS IN SPEECH AS MY SISTER MADGE DOES OFTEN TELL ME AND IT MAY WELL BE THAT I HAVE SAID SOMETHING WHICH WOUNDED YOU
75-853-0034 SAY NOT MORE ABOUT IT I PRAY YOU THEY PASSED UNDER THE GATEWAY WITH ITS GHASTLY BURDEN AND WERE SOON IN THE CROWDED STREETS OF LONDON HIGH OVERHEAD THE HOUSES EXTENDED EACH STORY ADVANCING BEYOND THAT BELOW IT
75-853-0035 UNTIL THE OCCUPIERS OF THE ATTICS COULD WELL NIGH SHAKE HANDS ACROSS THEY SOON LEFT THE MORE CROWDED STREETS AND TURNING TO THE RIGHT AFTER TEN MINUTES WALKING THE SMITH STOPPED IN FRONT OF A BOWYER SHOP NEAR ALDGATE
75-853-0036 HERE I WILL LEAVE YOU AND WILL ONE OF THESE DAYS RETURN TO INQUIRE IF YOUR HEALTH HAS TAKEN OUGHT OF HARM BY THE ROUGH BUFFETING OF THE STORM OF YESTER EVEN SO SAYING HE HANDED THE CHILD TO ITS MOTHER
75-853-0037 WITH A BENT BOW IN HIS ARM TAKING AIM AT A SPOT IN THE WALL THROUGH AN OPEN DOOR THREE MEN COULD BE SEEN IN AN INNER WORKSHOP CUTTING AND SHAPING THE WOOD FOR BOWS THE BOWYER
75-853-0038 LOOKED ROUND AS HIS VISITOR ENTERED THE SHOP AND THEN WITH A SUDDEN EXCLAMATION LOWERED THE BOW HUSH GILES THE LADY EXCLAIMED IT IS I BUT NAME NO NAMES IT WERE BEST THAT NONE KNEW ME HERE
75-853-0039 THE CRAFTSMAN CLOSED THE DOOR OF COMMUNICATION INTO THE INNER ROOM MY LADY ALICE HE EXCLAIMED IN A LOW TONE YOU HERE AND IN SUCH A GUISE SURELY IT IS I THE LADY SIGHED ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES I AM WELL NIGH INCLINED TO ASK MYSELF
75-853-0040 I HAD HEARD BUT VAGUELY OF YOUR TROUBLES GILES FLETCHER SAID BUT HOPED THAT THE RUMOURS WERE FALSE EVER SINCE THE DUKE OF KENT WAS EXECUTED THE AIR HAS BEEN FULL OF RUMOURS THEN CAME NEWS OF THE KILLING OF MORTIMER AND OF THE IMPRISONMENT OF THE KING'S MOTHER
75-853-0041 AND IT WAS SAID THAT MANY WHO WERE THOUGHT TO BE OF HER PARTY HAD BEEN ATTACKED AND SLAIN AND I HEARD AND THERE HE STOPPED YOU HEARD RIGHTLY GOOD GILES IT IS ALL TRUE A WEEK AFTER THE SLAYING OF MORTIMER
75-853-0042 WAS TAKEN ROLAND WAS KILLED AND I WAS CAST OUT WITH MY CHILD AFTERWARDS THEY REPENTED THAT THEY HAD LET ME GO AND SEARCHED FAR AND WIDE FOR ME BUT I WAS HIDDEN IN THE COTTAGE OF A WOODCUTTER
75-853-0043 THEY WERE TOO BUSY IN HUNTING DOWN OTHERS WHOM THEY PROCLAIMED TO BE ENEMIES OF THE KING AS THEY HAD WRONGFULLY SAID OF ROLAND WHO HAD BUT DONE HIS DUTY FAITHFULLY TO QUEEN ISABELLA AND WAS ASSUREDLY NO ENEMY OF HER SON
75-853-0044 BELIEVING THAT YOU AND BERTHA WOULD TAKE ME IN AND SHELTER ME IN MY GREAT NEED AYE THAT WILL WE WILLINGLY GILES SAID WAS NOT BERTHA YOUR NURSE AND TO WHOM SHOULD YOU COME IF NOT TO HER BUT WILL IT PLEASE YOU TO MOUNT THE STAIRS FOR BERTHA WILL NOT FORGIVE ME IF I KEEP YOU TALKING DOWN HERE
75-853-0045 WHAT A JOY IT WILL BE TO HER TO SEE YOU AGAIN SO SAYING GILES LED THE WAY TO THE APARTMENT ABOVE THERE WAS A SCREAM OF SURPRISE AND JOY FROM HIS WIFE AND THEN GILES QUIETLY WITHDREW DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN
75-853-0046 GEOFFREY WARD ENTERED THE SHOP OF GILES FLETCHER I HAVE BROUGHT YOU TWENTY SCORE OF ARROWHEADS MASTER GILES HE SAID THEY HAVE BEEN LONGER IN HAND THAN IS USUAL WITH ME BUT I HAVE BEEN PRESSED AND HOW GOES IT WITH THE LADY WHOM I BROUGHT TO YOUR DOOR LAST WEEK
75-853-0047 SHE WAS LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH WET AND HARDSHIP AND DOUBTLESS THEY TOOK ALL THE MORE EFFECT BECAUSE SHE WAS LOW IN SPIRIT AND WEAKENED WITH MUCH GRIEVING THAT NIGHT SHE WAS TAKEN WITH A SORT OF FEVER HOT AND COLD BY TURNS AND AT TIMES OFF HER HEAD
75-853-0048 AND IN TROTH MASTER WARD METHINKS THAT GOD WOULD DEAL MOST GENTLY WITH HER
75-853-0049 AND THAT BERTHA WOULD SERVE HER AS GLADLY AND FAITHFULLY AS EVER SHE DID WHEN SHE WAS HER NURSE YET SHE COULD NOT BUT GREATLY FEEL THE CHANGE SHE WAS TENDERLY BROUGHT UP BEING AS I TOLD YOU LAST WEEK THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF SIR HAROLD BROOME
75-853-0050 HER BROTHER WHO BUT A YEAR AGO BECAME LORD OF BROOMECASTLE AT THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER WAS ONE OF THE QUEEN'S MEN AND IT WAS HE I BELIEVE WHO BROUGHT SIR ROLAND SOMERS TO THAT SIDE HE WAS SLAIN ON THE SAME NIGHT AS MORTIMER
75-853-0051 AND HIS LANDS LIKE THOSE OF SIR ROLAND HAVE BEEN SEIZED BY THE CROWN THE CHILD UPSTAIRS IS BY RIGHT HEIR TO BOTH ESTATES SEEING THAT HIS UNCLE DIED UNMARRIED
75-853-0052 THEY WILL DOUBTLESS BE CONFERRED UPON THOSE WHO HAVE AIDED THE YOUNG KING IN FREEING HIMSELF FROM HIS MOTHER'S DOMINATION FOR WHICH INDEED ALTHOUGH I LAMENT THAT LADY ALICE SHOULD HAVE SUFFERED SO SORELY IN THE DOING OF IT I BLAME HIM NOT AT ALL
75-853-0053 HE IS A NOBLE PRINCE AND WILL MAKE US A GREAT KING AND THE DOINGS OF HIS MOTHER HAVE BEEN A SHAME TO US ALL HOWEVER I MEDDLE NOT IN POLITICS IF THE POOR LADY DIES AS METHINKS IS WELL NIGH CERTAIN BERTHA AND I WILL BRING UP THE BOY AS OUR OWN
75-853-0054 I HAVE TALKED IT OVER WITH MY WIFE AND SO FAR SHE AND I ARE NOT OF ONE MIND I THINK IT WILL BE BEST TO KEEP HIM IN IGNORANCE OF HIS BIRTH AND LINEAGE SINCE THE KNOWLEDGE CANNOT BENEFIT HIM AND WILL BUT RENDER HIM DISCONTENTED WITH HIS LOT
75-853-0055 TO TAKE TO MY CALLING IN WHICH HE MIGHT OTHERWISE
75-853-0056 BUT BERTHA HATH NOTIONS YOU HAVE NOT TAKEN A WIFE TO YOURSELF MASTER GEOFFREY OR YOU WOULD KNOW THAT WOMEN OFT HAVE FANCIES WHICH WANDER WIDELY FROM HARD FACTS AND SHE SAYS SHE WOULD HAVE HIM BROUGHT UP AS A MAN AT ARMS
75-853-0057 SO THAT HE MAY DO VALIANT DEEDS AND WIN BACK SOME DAY THE TITLE AND HONOUR OF HIS FAMILY GEOFFREY WARD LAUGHED
75-853-0058 YOU NEED NOT FOR THE PRESENT TROUBLE ABOUT THE CHILD'S CALLING
75-853-0059 AT ANY RATE WHETHER HE FOLLOWS YOUR TRADE
75-853-0060 THE KNOWLEDGE OF ARMS MAY WELL BE OF USE TO HIM AND I PROMISE YOU THAT SUCH SKILL AS I HAVE I WILL TEACH HIM WHEN HE GROWS OLD ENOUGH TO WIELD SWORD AND BATTLE AXE AS YOU KNOW I MAY WITHOUT BOASTING SAY
75-853-0061 THAT HE COULD SCARCE HAVE A BETTER MASTER SEEING THAT I HAVE FOR THREE YEARS CARRIED AWAY THE PRIZE FOR THE BEST SWORD PLAYER AT THE SPORTS
75-853-0062 AS TO ARCHERY HE NEED NOT GO FAR TO LEARN IT SINCE YOUR APPRENTICE WILL PARKER LAST YEAR WON THE PRIZE AS THE BEST MARKSMAN IN THE CITY BOUNDS TRUST ME
75-853-0063 THE RUMOURS THAT WE ARE LIKELY ERE LONG TO HAVE WAR WITH FRANCE HAVE RARELY BETTERED MY TRADE SINCE THE WARS IN SCOTLAND MEN'S ARMS HAVE RUSTED SOMEWHAT
75-853-0064 AND MY TWO MEN ARE HARD AT WORK MENDING ARMOUR AND FITTING SWORDS TO HILTS AND FORGING PIKE HEADS YOU SEE
75-853-0065 THE FEVER ABATED BUT LEFT HER PROSTRATE IN STRENGTH FOR A FEW WEEKS SHE LINGERED
75-853-0066 TEACH HIM TO BE HONEST AND TRUE IT WERE BETTER METHINKS THAT HE GREW UP THINKING YOU HIS FATHER AND MOTHER FOR OTHERWISE HE MAY GROW DISCONTENTED WITH HIS LOT
75-853-0067 AS YOU SEE HIS DISPOSITION AND MIND IF HE IS CONTENT TO SETTLE DOWN TO A PEACEFUL LIFE HERE SAY NOUGHT TO HIM WHICH WOULD UNSETTLE HIS MIND BUT IF WALTER TURN OUT TO HAVE AN ADVENTUROUS DISPOSITION
75-853-0068 OF HIS HISTORY NOT ENCOURAGING HIM TO HOPE TO RECOVER HIS FATHER'S LANDS AND MINE FOR THAT CAN NEVER BE SEEING THAT BEFORE THAT TIME CAN COME THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ENJOYED FOR MANY YEARS BY OTHERS BUT THAT HE MAY LEARN TO BEAR HIMSELF BRAVELY
75-853-0069 AND GENTLY AS BECOMES ONE OF GOOD BLOOD A FEW DAYS LATER LADY ALICE BREATHED HER LAST AND AT HER OWN REQUEST WAS BURIED QUIETLY AND WITHOUT POMP AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A CHILD OF THE BOWMAN
75-853-0070 A PLAIN STONE WITH THE NAME DAME ALICE SOMERS MARKING THE GRAVE THE BOY GREW AND THROVE UNTIL AT FOURTEEN YEARS OLD THERE WAS NO STRONGER OR STURDIER LAD OF HIS AGE WITHIN THE CITY BOUNDS
75-853-0071 GILES HAD CAUSED HIM TO BE TAUGHT TO READ AND WRITE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHICH WERE COMMON AMONG THE CITIZENS ALTHOUGH THEY WERE UNTIL LONG AFTERWARDS RARE AMONG THE WARLIKE BARONS THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME HOWEVER
75-853-0072 OFTTIMES GROWING INTO EARNEST WERE FOUGHT BETWEEN THE LADS OF THE DIFFERENT WARDS WALTER FLETCHER AS HE WAS KNOWN AMONG HIS PLAY FELLOWS
75-853-0073 WON FOR HIMSELF THE PROUD POSITION OF CAPTAIN OF THE BOYS OF THE WARD OF ALDGATE GEOFFREY WARD HAD KEPT HIS WORD AND HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO GIVE THE LAD LESSONS IN THE USE OF ARMS WHEN NOT ENGAGED OTHERWISE WALTER WOULD ALMOST EVERY AFTERNOON
75-853-0074 CROSS LONDON BRIDGE AND WOULD SPEND HOURS IN THE ARMOURER'S FORGE
75-853-0075 AS SOON AS THE BOY COULD HANDLE A LIGHT TOOL GEOFFREY ALLOWED HIM TO WORK AND ALTHOUGH NOT ABLE TO WIELD THE HEAVY SLEDGE WALTER WAS ABLE TO DO MUCH OF THE FINER WORK
75-853-0076 IN WHICH CASE HE WOULD TAKE HIM SOME DAY AS HIS PARTNER IN THE FORGE AFTER WORK WAS OVER AND THE MEN HAD GONE AWAY
75-853-0077 THAT HE RAPIDLY ACQUIRED THEIR USE AND GEOFFREY FORESAW THAT HE WOULD ONE DAY SHOULD HIS THOUGHTS TURN THAT WAY PROVE A MIGHTY MAN AT ARMS
75-853-0078 WHICH HAD MUCH TO DO WITH WALTER'S POSITION AMONG HIS COMRADES THE SKILL AND STRENGTH WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED IN WIELDING THE HAMMER AND BY PRACTICE WITH THE SWORD RENDERED HIM A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT WITH THE STICKS WHICH FORMED THE WEAPONS IN THE MIMIC BATTLES
75-853-0079 AND INDEED NOT A FEW WERE THE COMPLAINTS WHICH WERE BROUGHT BEFORE GILES FLETCHER OF BRUISES AND HURTS CAUSED BY HIM YOU ARE TOO TURBULENT WALTER THE BOWYER SAID ONE DAY WHEN A HABERDASHER FROM THE WARD OF ALDERSGATE CAME TO COMPLAIN
75-853-0080 THAT HIS SON'S HEAD HAD BEEN BADLY CUT BY A BLOW WITH A CLUB FROM WALTER FLETCHER
75-853-0081 WHY DO YOU NOT PLAY MORE QUIETLY THE FEUDS BETWEEN THE BOYS OF DIFFERENT WARDS ARE BECOMING A SERIOUS NUISANCE AND MANY INJURIES HAVE BEEN INFLICTED
75-853-0082 THAT NO BOY NOT YET APPRENTICED TO A TRADE
75-853-0083 I DON'T WANT TO BE TURBULENT WALTER SAID
75-853-0084 MY FATHER IS TALKING OF APPRENTICING ME MASTER GEOFFREY WALTER SAID THAT EVENING I HOPE THAT YOU WILL AS YOU WERE GOOD ENOUGH TO PROMISE TALK WITH HIM ABOUT APPRENTICING ME TO YOUR CRAFT RATHER THAN TO HIS I SHOULD NEVER TAKE TO THE MAKING OF BOWS
75-853-0085 THOUGH INDEED I LIKE WELL TO USE THEM AND WILL PARKER WHO IS TEACHING ME SAYS THAT I SHOW RARE PROMISE BUT IT WOULD NEVER BE TO MY TASTE TO STAND ALL DAY SAWING AND SMOOTHING AND POLISHING ONE BOW IS TO ME MUCH LIKE ANOTHER THOUGH MY FATHER HOLDS THAT THERE ARE RARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM
75-853-0086 BUT SOME DAY MASTER GEOFFREY WHEN I HAVE SERVED MY TIME I MEAN TO FOLLOW THE ARMY THERE IS ALWAYS WORK THERE FOR ARMOURERS TO DO AND SOMETIMES AT A PINCH THEY MAY EVEN GET THEIR SHARE OF FIGHTING WALTER DID NOT VENTURE TO SAY THAT HE WOULD PREFER TO BE A MAN AT ARMS
75-853-0087 HE SHOULD LONG TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF IN THE FIELD HE SAID NOTHING OF THIS HOWEVER BUT RENEWED HIS PROMISE TO SPEAK TO GILES FLETCHER
