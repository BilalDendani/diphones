5781-52137-0000 THERE WAS A WHITE MAN IN RICHLAND COUNTY SOUTH CAROLINA NAMED MISTER BLACK WHO MADE HIS LIVING BY HUNTING RUNAWAY SLAVES
5781-52137-0001 WHICH WAS THE ONLY HORSE HE OWNED SHE WAS A THIN RAW BONED CREATURE AND LOOKED AS THOUGH SHE COULD HARDLY WALK BUT KNEW THE BUSINESS ABOUT AS WELL AS HER MASTER AND IN SUCH TROUBLES AS ABOVE STATED SHE USED TO CARRY HIM PRETTY FAST OUT OF DANGER
5781-52137-0002 MISTER BLACK CAUGHT SEVERAL RUNAWAY SLAVES BELONGING TO COLONEL SINGLETON I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO CHASE RUNAWAY SLAVES OUT OF THE FOREST RIGHT THROUGH THE COLONEL'S PLANTATION THROUGH A CROWD OF OTHER NEGROES AND HIS DOGS WOULD NEVER MISTAKE ANY AMONG THE CROWD
5781-52137-0003 FOR THE ONES THEY WERE AFTER WHEN THESE HOUND DOGS CHASED THE RUNAWAYS THROUGH FARMS IN THAT WAY MANY OF THEM WERE KILLED AND BURIED IN THE COTTON OR CORN FIELD BY SOME AMONG THE CROWD OF NEGROES THROUGH WHICH THEY PASSED
5781-52137-0004 IN GENERAL THE SLAVES HATED BLOODHOUNDS AND WOULD KILL THEM ANY TIME THEY GOT A CHANCE BUT ESPECIALLY ON SUCH OCCASIONS AS ABOVE STATED TO KEEP THEM FROM CAPTURING RUNAWAYS ONCE EIGHT SLAVES RAN AWAY FROM COLONEL SINGLETON'S PLANTATION
5781-52137-0005 AND MISTER BLACK WITH TWENTY FIVE HOUND DOGS WAS HIRED TO HUNT THEM UP THE DOGS STRUCK TRAIL OF THE RUNAWAYS LATE ONE AFTERNOON AND CHASED THEM ALL THAT NIGHT DURING WHICH TIME THEY GOT SCATTERED NEXT MORNING
5781-52137-0006 WHILE CHASING THE RUNAWAYS SOME AMONG THE CROWD KILLED SIX OF THE DOGS INCLUDING THE TWO LEADING ONES
5781-52137-0007 THOUGH A MILE OR MORE OFF KNEW THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED FROM THE IRREGULAR BARKING OF THE OTHER DOGS AND ALSO BECAUSE HE DID NOT HEAR THE YELLING OF THE TWO LEADING DOGS SO HE BLEW HIS HORN CALLED THE REST OF HIS DOGS AND GAVE UP THE CHASE UNTIL HE HAD REPLACED HIS LEADING DOGS BY OTHERS
5781-52137-0008 WHICH HE ALWAYS HAD ON HAND AT HOME SLAVE HUNTERS GENERALLY HAD ONE OR TWO AMONG THE PACK OF HOUND DOGS CALLED TRAILERS OR LEADERS WHICH THE OTHERS FIFTY OR MORE WERE TRAINED TO FOLLOW SO IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO THE LEADERS WHILE ON CHASE
5781-52137-0009 THE REST WOULD BECOME CONFUSED AND COULD NOT FOLLOW THE RUNAWAY BUT IF THE LEADERS WERE HURT OR KILLED AFTER THE RUNAWAYS WERE CAPTURED THE REST WOULD SURROUND AND GUARD THEM UNTIL THE HUNTER REACHED THEM AS HE WAS ALWAYS A MILE OR MORE BEHIND
5781-52137-0010 MISTER BLACK RESUMED THE CHASE AND CAUGHT SOME OF THE RUNAWAYS BUT THE REST CAME HOME THEMSELVES THE LAST RUNAWAY SLAVE MISTER BLACK WAS HIRED TO HUNT BELONGED TO COLONEL M R SINGLETON AND WAS NAMED DICK
5781-52137-0011 BUT INSTEAD OF DICK HE CAUGHT A SLAVE BELONGING TO A MAN IN SUMTERVILLE COUNTY WHO HAD BEEN IN THE WOODS SEVEN YEARS THIS RUNAWAY SLAVE HAD ANOTHER NAME AT HOME BUT WHILE IN THE WOODS HAD ASSUMED THE NAME OF CHAMPION
5781-52137-0012 FOR HIS SUCCESS IN KEEPING SLAVE HUNTERS FROM CAPTURING HIM UP TO THAT TIME MISTER BLACK THE HUNTER CHASED DICK AND CHAMPION TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS ON THE MORNING BEFORE THE CAPTURE OF THE LATTER THEY SWAM ACROSS THE WATER REE RIVER
5781-52137-0013 AFTER THEY GOT ACROSS THEY WERE SEPARATED THE DOGS FOLLOWED CHAMPION AND RAN HIM DOWN THAT MORNING ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK CHAMPION HAD A GUN AND PISTOL AS THE FIRST DOG RAN UP AND OPENED HIS MOUTH TO TAKE HOLD OF HIM
5781-52137-0014 HE DISCHARGED THE CONTENTS OF THE PISTOL IN HIS MOUTH AND KILLED HIM INSTANTLY THE REST OF THE DOGS DID NOT TAKE HOLD OF HIM BUT SURROUNDED HIM AND HELD HIM AT BAY UNTIL THE HUNTER REACHED THE SPOT WHEN MISTER BLACK RODE UP WITHIN GUNSHOT CHAMPION AIMED AT HIM
5781-52137-0015 WITH A LOADED DOUBLE BARREL GUN BUT THE CAPS OF BOTH BARRELS SNAPPED FROM BEING WET BY RUNNING THROUGH THE BUSHES MISTER BLACK HAD A GUN AND PISTOL TOO HE ATTEMPTED TO SHOOT THE NEGRO BUT WILLIAM TURNER COLONEL SINGLETON'S OVERSEER
5781-52137-0016 MISTER TURNER THE OVERSEER STRUCK HIM ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD WITH THE BUTT OF A LOADED WHIP THIS STUNNED HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND BY THE TIME HE HAD REGAINED HIS SENSES THEY HAD HANDCUFFED HIM AFTER THE NEGRO HAD BEEN HANDCUFFED
5781-52137-0017 MISTER BLACK WANTED TO ABUSE HIM BECAUSE HE HAD KILLED THE DOG AND ATTEMPTED TO SHOOT HIM BUT MISTER TURNER THE OVERSEER WOULD NOT LET HIM CHAMPION WAS TAKEN TO COLONEL SINGLETON'S PLANTATION LOCKED UP IN THE DUNGEON UNDER THE OVERSEER'S HOUSE
5781-52137-0018 AND HIS MASTER WAS NOTIFIED OF HIS CAPTURE HE WAS A MULATTO NEGRO AND HIS MASTER WHO WAS HIS FATHER SENT FOR HIM AT COLONEL SINGLETON'S PLANTATION BUT I NEVER LEARNED WHETHER MISTER BLACK THE HUNTER WAS EVER PAID FOR CAPTURING HIM
5781-52137-0019 WITH EIGHT OR TEN HELPLESS CHILDREN WHOM I KNEW AS WELL AS I DID MY FELLOW NEGROES ON THE COLONEL'S PLANTATION BUT AS CRUEL AS MISTER BLACK WAS TO RUNAWAY SLAVES HIS FAMILY WAS ALMOST WHOLLY SUPPORTED BY NEGROES I HAVE KNOWN IN SOME CASES
5781-52137-0020 THAT THEY STOLE FROM THEIR MASTERS TO HELP THIS FAMILY THE NEGROES WERE SO KIND TO MISTER BLACK'S FAMILY THAT HIS WIFE TURNED AGAINST HIM FOR HIS CRUELTY TO RUNAWAY SLAVES
5781-52137-0021 WHILE OTHERS IN A MAD FIT OF PASSION WOULD SAY TO THEM I WANT YOU TO BRING MY RUNAWAY NIGGER HOME DEAD OR ALIVE ALL OF THE SLAVE HUNTERS USED TO PRACTICE CRUELTY UPON THE RUNAWAY SLAVES
5781-52137-0022 MORE ESPECIALLY UPON THOSE WHOSE MASTERS WOULD SAY TO HUNTERS BRING THEM DEAD OR ALIVE
5781-52137-0023 IT WAS RUMORED THAT MANY OF THE RUNAWAY SLAVES THAT WERE NEVER HEARD OF AFTERWARD WERE CAPTURED AND KILLED IN THE WOODS BY MISTER BLACK BUT NO SPECIAL CLUE TO THIS COULD BE FOUND FINALLY MISTER BLACK WAS HIRED TO CAPTURE A RUNAWAY SLAVE IN BARNWELL COUNTY SOUTH CAROLINA
5781-52137-0024 THIS SLAVE WAS WITH ANOTHER WHO WAS THOUGHT WELL OF BY HIS MASTER BUT HATED BY THE OVERSEER
5781-52137-0025 AND GAVE MESSRS BLACK AND MOTLEY A HARD FIGHT AFTER THE NEGRO HAD BEEN CAPTURED THEY KILLED HIM CUT HIM UP AND GAVE HIS REMAINS TO THE LIVING DOGS THE COMPANION OF THE MURDERED SLAVE WAS NOT CAUGHT A FEW DAYS AFTER THE CHASE
5781-52137-0026 WHILE WANDERING AROUND IN THE WOOD IN A SOMEWHAT EXCITED STATE HE CAME TO A SPOT WHERE THE BUSHES AND LEAVES SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN IN A STIRRED UP CONDITION AS THOUGH THERE HAD BEEN TUSSLING BY TWO PARTIES ON LOOKING AROUND IN THIS DISORDERED SPOT
5781-52137-0027 DIGGING DOWN IN THE SPOT HE SOON DISCOVERED PIECES OF THE PERSON OF A DEAD MAN WHOM HE COULD NOT IDENTIFY BUT WAS SATISFIED THAT IT WAS THE REMAINS OF HIS COMPANION FROM WHOM HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO SEPARATE A FEW DAYS BEFORE
5781-52137-0028 THIS SIGHT FRIGHTENED THE RUNAWAY NEGRO SO THAT HE LEFT THE WOODS WENT HOME TO HIS MASTER AND TOLD THE STORY
5781-52137-0029 THE MASTER OF THE MURDERED NEGRO WAS STILL IGNORANT OF HIS DEATH HE WAS IN HOPES THAT HIS SLAVE WOULD RETURN BUT FINDING THAT HIS SLAVE DID NOT RETURN AS EXPECTED THE MASTER BECAME UNEASY AND OFFERED A REWARD TO ANY ONE
5781-52137-0030 IN THE MEANTIME HE DISCHARGED THE OVERSEER WHO HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF HIS SLAVE RUNNING AWAY AND HE ALSO KEPT THE OVERSEER'S SALARY OF FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH WAS THE ANNUAL PAY FOR OVERSEERING HIS PLANTATION
5781-52137-0031 MISTER BLACK'S HOUSE WAS IN RICHLAND COUNTY AND AS HE WAS THE LAST WHO HAD HUNTED RUNAWAY SLAVES IN BARNWELL COUNTY BEFORE THE MURDER SUSPICION RESTED ON HIM STILL NO ONE SAID ANYTHING TO HIM
5781-52137-0032 BUT HE WAS VERY CLOSELY WATCHED BY MEN OF HIS OWN COUNTY WHOSE INTEREST WAS NOT IN THE HATEFULNESS OF THE CRIME COMMITTED BUT RATHER IN THE REWARD OFFERED BY THE MASTER
5781-52137-0033 OF HIS RUNAWAY SLAVE SOMETIME AFTER THE CASE HAD OCCURRED ANOTHER WHITE MAN OF RICHLAND COUNTY BECAME QUITE A FRIEND TO MISTER BLACK THE SLAVE HUNTER THIS APPARENT FRIENDSHIP SOON LED MISTER BLACK TO TELL THE SECRET
5781-52137-0034 WHICH SPEEDILY BROUGHT HIM TO TRIAL WHILE HE AND HIS PRETENDED FRIEND WERE ON A DRINKING SPREE IN THE MIDST OF THE MERRIMENT OF COURSE THE CONVERSATION WAS HOW TO CONTROL NEGROES AS THAT WAS THE PRINCIPAL TOPIC OF THE POOR WHITE MEN SOUTH IN THE DAYS OF SLAVERY
5781-52137-0035 IN THE CONVERSATION THIS FRIEND SPOKE OF SEVERAL PLANS WHICH HE SAID IF PROPERLY CARRIED OUT
5781-52137-0036 AFTER THE FRIEND HAD SAID SO MUCH TO MISTER BLACK THE SLAVE HUNTER
5781-52137-0037 THE WAY TO SHOW A NIGGER THAT WOULD RESIST A WHITE MAN HIS PLACE IS TO PUT HIM AMONG THE MISSING NOT LONG SINCE I WENT TO BARNWELL COUNTY TO HUNT A RUNAWAY NIGGER AND MY DOGS STRUCK TRAIL OF ANOTHER INSTEAD OF THE ONE I WANTED TO CAPTURE
5781-52137-0038 AND MOTLEY AND I CUT HIM UP AND GAVE THE PIECES TO THE REMAINDER OF MY DOGS THAT IS THE WAY I PUT A NIGGER IN HIS PLACE AFTER THE SECRET HAD BEEN REVEALED MISTER BLACK'S FRIEND EXCUSED HIMSELF
5781-52137-0039 AND THE FORMER SAW HIM NO MORE UNTIL HE APPEARED AS A WITNESS AGAINST HIM THE COMPANION OF THE MURDERED NEGRO WAS SUMMONED TO CARRY THE INVESTIGATING PARTY INCLUDING THE MURDERER TO THE SPOT WHERE HIS COMPANION HAD BEEN BURIED
5781-52137-0040 AFTER SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED HE CONFESSED THE COMMISSION OF THAT CRIME AND ALSO TOLD THAT HE HAD KILLED SEVERAL RUNAWAY NEGROES PREVIOUSLY IN HIS OWN COUNTY SO MISTER BLACK AND MOTLEY HIS COMPANION WERE BOTH HANGED IN BARNWELL COUNTY SOUTH CAROLINA
5781-52137-0041 THE SYSTEM OF SLAVERY OUTLIVED MISTER BLACK THE SLAVE HUNTER JUST SIX YEARS MANNING BROWN AND AUNT BETTY A MAN BY THE NAME OF MANNING BROWN WAS NURSED BY AN OLD COLORED WOMAN HE CALLED MAMMA BETTY
5781-52137-0042 SHE WAS NATURALLY GOOD NATURED AND A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN AND MISTER BROWN GAINED MANY OF HER GOOD QUALITIES WHEN HE WAS UNDER HER ENTIRE CONTROL AT WHICH TIME HE WAS SAID TO BE A BOY OF VERY FINE SENSE OF FEELING AND QUITE PROMISING BUT WHEN APPROACHING MANHOOD
5781-52137-0043 MISTER BROWN FELL AMONG A CLASS OF OTHER WHITE MEN WHO IN THE DAYS OF SLAVERY WERE UNBRIDLED IN THEIR HABITS WITH THIS CLASS OF MEN HE BEGAN TO DRINK AND STEP BY STEP IN THIS RAPID STRIDE HE SOON BECAME A CONFIRMED DRUNKARD
5781-52137-0044 THIS HABIT SO OVER COATED THE GOOD INFLUENCE HE HAD GAINED FROM THE COLORED WOMAN THAT IT RENDERED HIM DANGEROUS NOT ONLY TO HIS ENEMIES BUT ALSO TO HIS FRIENDS MANNING BROWN WAS FEARED BY MOST OF THE OTHER WHITE MEN IN RICHLAND COUNTY SOUTH CAROLINA
5781-52137-0045 AND STRANGE TO SAY ALTHOUGH HE WAS DANGEROUS TO WHITE MEN YET HE NEVER LOST THE RESPECT HE HAD FOR COLORED PEOPLE IN HIS BOYHOOD DAYS HE ATE DRANK AND SLEPT AMONG COLORED PEOPLE AFTER HE WAS A GROWN MAN
5781-52137-0046 AND IN MANY CASES WHEN OTHER WHITE MEN WHO WERE CALLED PATROLS CAUGHT COLORED PEOPLE AWAY FROM HOME WITHOUT TICKETS AND WERE ABOUT TO WHIP THEM MISTER BROWN WOULD RIDE UP AND SAY THE FIRST MAN WHO RAISES A WHIP AT ONE OF THOSE NEGROES I WILL BLOW HIS BRAINS OUT
5781-52137-0047 HE WAS DANGEROUS TO MANY OF THE WHITE PEOPLE AND FEARED BY THEM A MAN BY THE NAME OF PETER GAFNEY FOUGHT A DUEL WITH HIS BROTHER IN LAW
5781-52137-0048 MISTER BROWN WHO ACTED AS A SECOND FOR MISTER GAFNEY IN THE FIGHT FELT THE LOSS OF HIS OLD FRIEND VERY DEEPLY A SHORT TIME AFTER THIS HE SENT A CHALLENGE TO DOCTOR RAY STATING
5781-52137-0049 ON THE SPOT WHERE YOU KILLED P T GAFNEY FOR A DUEL OR I WILL SHOOT YOU ON FIRST SIGHT WHEREVER I MEET YOU YOURS M BROWN
5781-52137-0050 BUT DOCTOR RAY REFUSED IN THE FACE OF THE THREAT TO ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE KNOWING THE DISPOSITION OF MISTER BROWN THE PEOPLE IN THAT COUNTY WERE INFLAMED WITH EXCITEMENT BECAUSE THE DOCTOR WAS LIABLE AT ANY MOMENT WHILE RIDING IN THE ROAD TO BE KILLED
5781-52137-0051 THE DOCTOR GAVE UP VISITING THE MOST OF HIS SICK PATIENTS AND ALMOST WHOLLY CONFINED HIMSELF TO HIS LARGE PLANTATION AT THE SAME TIME MISTER BROWN WAS CLOSELY WATCHED BY HIS FRIENDS TO KEEP HIM FROM WAYLAYING THE DOCTOR
5781-52137-0052 A SHORT TIME AFTER THIS THREAT MISTER BROWN COMMENCED TO DRINK HARDER THAN EVER SO THAT AT TIMES HE DID NOT KNOW HIS OWN FAMILY BUT THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD WAS SLOWLY LEADING MISTER BROWN THROUGH THE UNKNOWN PATHS TO A SUDDEN CHANGE OF LIFE
5781-52137-0053 AS WE SHALL SOON SEE MISTER BROWN'S FAMILY CONSISTED OF A WIFE ONE CHILD AND AUNT BETTY THE OLD COLORED WOMAN WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP SHE WAS THE ONLY MOTHER HE KNEW FOR HIS OWN MOTHER HAD DIED WHEN HE WAS AN INFANT
5781-52137-0054 AND HER DYING REQUEST HAD BEEN THAT MAMMA BETTY THE OLD WOMAN SHOULD BRING UP THIS BOY WHO WAS AN ONLY CHILD
5781-52137-0055 ONLY WHAT SHE CHOSE TO DO AND THAT HE WOULD TAKE CARE OF HER THE BALANCE OF HER DAYS AND MISSUS BROWN REGARDED AUNT BETTY MORE AS A MOTHER IN LAW THAN AS A NEGRESS SERVANT SOMETIMES WHEN MISTER BROWN WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIS WIFE HE WOULD TO HIS MAMMA BETTY
5781-52137-0056 HE WENT INTO HIS BEDROOM AND LAY DOWN ACROSS THE BED TALKING TO HIMSELF HIS WIFE WENT IN TO SPEAK TO HIM BUT AS SHE ENTERED HE JUMPED UP AND GOT HIS LOADED DOUBLE BARRELLED GUN AND THREATENED TO SHOOT HER FRIGHTENED AT THIS SHE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM AND SCREAMED SAYING
5781-52137-0057 FOR HE THREATENED TO SHOOT ME WITH THAT OLD FAMILIAR CONFIDENCE IN ONE WHO HAD OFTEN LISTENED TO HER ADVICE AUNT BETTY WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND TO THE ROOM WHERE SHE FOUND MISTER BROWN LYING ACROSS THE BED WITH THE GUN BY HIS SIDE ON ENTERING THE ROOM
5781-52137-0058 SHE DROPPED INSTANTLY TO THE FLOOR MISTER BROWN LAY ACROSS THE BED AS BEFORE WITH THE GUN BY HIS SIDE TALKING TO HIMSELF AND SOON DROPPED TO SLEEP MISSUS BROWN FAINTED AWAY SEVERAL TIMES UNDER THE EXCITEMENT AUNT BETTY LIVED ABOUT AN HOUR
5781-52137-0059 O MY LORD I WANTED TO SEE MY CHILD BEFORE I DIE AND I KNOW THAT HE WOULD WANT TO SEE HIS MAMMA BETTY TOO BEFORE SHE LEAVES HIM
5781-52137-0060 DURING THE TIME SHE LIVED SHE PRAYED FOR MISTER BROWN AND REQUESTED THAT HE WOULD CHANGE HIS COURSE OF LIFE BECOME A CHRISTIAN AND MEET HER IN HEAVEN AFTER SINGING ONE OF HER FAMILIAR HYMNS AUNT BETTY SAID TO SOME ONE WHO STOOD BY HER BEDSIDE
5781-52137-0061 THAT SHE DIED BEFORE HE REACHED THERE WHEN MISTER BROWN AWOKE FROM HIS DRUNKEN STATE IN THE NIGHT AND LEARNED THE SAD NEWS OF AUNT BETTY'S DEATH OF WHICH HE HAD BEEN THE CAUSE HE CLASPED HIS HANDS AND CRIED OUT WHAT IS IT POSSIBLE THAT MY MAMMA BETTY
5781-52137-0062 BUT THAT VOICE WAS HUSHED IN DEATH
5781-52137-0063 THAT NIGHT MISTER BROWN TOOK THE TRAIN TO COLUMBIA THE CAPITAL OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GAVE HIMSELF UP TO THE LAW NEXT DAY HE WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS ALL RIGHT THAT THE OLD NEGRESS WAS HIS SLAVE BUT MISTER BROWN WAS DISSATISFIED
5781-52137-0064 HE CAME BACK HOME AND INVITED ALL THE WHITE NEIGHBORS AND SLAVES TO AUNT BETTY'S FUNERAL IN WHICH HE AND HIS FAMILY TOOK PART AFTER THE EXCITEMENT WAS OVER THE MESSAGE OF AUNT BETTY WAS DELIVERED TO MISTER BROWN
5781-52137-0065 HE WAS TOLD THAT HER LAST REQUEST HAD BEEN THAT HE WOULD MEET HER IN HEAVEN HE ANSWERED I WILL MISTER BROWN THEN AND THERE TOOK AN OATH THAT HE WOULD DRINK NO MORE STRONG DRINKS HE THEN DISPOSED OF HIS SLAVES
5781-52137-0066 BUT HOW I DID NOT LEARN SOON AFTER THIS HE WAS CONVERTED AND BECAME ONE OF THE ABLEST PREACHERS IN RICHLAND COUNTY SOUTH CAROLINA
