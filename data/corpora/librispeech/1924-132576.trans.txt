1924-132576-0000 FOR MANY A LONG MONTH LOST IN SNOW PROFOUND WHEN SOL FROM CANCER SENDS THE SEASONS BLAND AND IN THEIR NORTHERN CAVE THE STORMS HATH BOUND FROM SILENT MOUNTAINS STRAIGHT WITH STARTLING SOUND
1924-132576-0001 TORRENTS ARE HURL'D GREEN HILLS EMERGE AND LO THE TREES WITH FOLIAGE CLIFFS WITH FLOW'RS ARE CROWN'D PURE RILLS THROUGH VALES OF VERDURE WARBLING GO AND WONDER LOVE AND JOY
1924-132576-0002 THE PEASANT'S HEART O'ERFLOW BEATTIE SEVERAL OF HER SUCCEEDING DAYS PASSED IN SUSPENSE FOR LUDOVICO COULD ONLY LEARN FROM THE SOLDIERS
1924-132576-0003 THAT THERE WAS A PRISONER IN THE APARTMENT DESCRIBED TO HIM BY EMILY AND THAT HE WAS A FRENCHMAN WHOM THEY HAD TAKEN IN ONE OF THEIR SKIRMISHES WITH A PARTY OF HIS COUNTRYMEN DURING THIS INTERVAL
1924-132576-0004 FOR TO HIS PROTECTION ONLY COULD SHE ATTRIBUTE HER PRESENT REPOSE AND IN THIS SHE WAS NOW SO SECURE THAT SHE DID NOT WISH TO LEAVE THE CASTLE TILL SHE COULD OBTAIN SOME CERTAINTY CONCERNING VALANCOURT FOR WHICH SHE WAITED
1924-132576-0005 INDEED WITHOUT ANY SACRIFICE OF HER OWN COMFORT SINCE NO CIRCUMSTANCE HAD OCCURRED TO MAKE HER ESCAPE PROBABLE ON THE FOURTH DAY LUDOVICO INFORMED HER
1924-132576-0006 THAT HE HAD HOPES OF BEING ADMITTED TO THE PRESENCE OF THE PRISONER IT BEING THE TURN OF A SOLDIER WITH WHOM HE HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME FAMILIAR TO ATTEND HIM ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT HE WAS NOT DECEIVED IN HIS HOPE
1924-132576-0007 FOR UNDER PRETENCE OF CARRYING IN A PITCHER OF WATER HE ENTERED THE PRISON
1924-132576-0008 HE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE HIS CONFERENCE WITH THE PRISONER A VERY SHORT ONE EMILY AWAITED THE RESULT IN HER OWN APARTMENT
1924-132576-0009 LUDOVICO HAVING PROMISED TO ACCOMPANY ANNETTE TO THE CORRIDOR IN THE EVENING WHERE AFTER SEVERAL HOURS IMPATIENTLY COUNTED HE ARRIVED EMILY HAVING THEN UTTERED THE NAME OF VALANCOURT COULD ARTICULATE NO MORE
1924-132576-0010 BUT HESITATED IN TREMBLING EXPECTATION THE CHEVALIER WOULD NOT ENTRUST ME WITH HIS NAME SIGNORA REPLIED LUDOVICO BUT WHEN I JUST MENTIONED YOURS HE SEEMED OVERWHELMED WITH JOY
1924-132576-0011 SAID ANNETTE AND LOOKED IMPATIENTLY AT LUDOVICO WHO UNDERSTOOD HER LOOK AND REPLIED TO EMILY YES LADY THE CHEVALIER DOES INDEED REMEMBER YOU AND I AM SURE HAS A VERY GREAT REGARD FOR YOU
1924-132576-0012 AND I MADE BOLD TO SAY YOU HAD FOR HIM HE THEN ENQUIRED HOW YOU CAME TO KNOW HE WAS IN THE CASTLE AND WHETHER YOU ORDERED ME TO SPEAK TO HIM THE FIRST QUESTION I COULD NOT ANSWER
1924-132576-0013 BUT THE SECOND I DID AND THEN HE WENT OFF INTO HIS ECSTASIES AGAIN I WAS AFRAID HIS JOY WOULD HAVE BETRAYED HIM TO THE SENTINEL AT THE DOOR BUT HOW DOES HE LOOK LUDOVICO INTERRUPTED EMILY
1924-132576-0014 I SAW NO SYMPTOM OF THAT LADY WHILE I WAS WITH HIM FOR HE SEEMED IN THE FINEST SPIRITS I EVER SAW ANY BODY IN IN ALL MY LIFE HIS COUNTENANCE WAS ALL JOY AND
1924-132576-0015 IF ONE MAY JUDGE FROM THAT HE WAS VERY WELL BUT I DID NOT ASK HIM DID HE SEND ME NO MESSAGE SAID EMILY O YES SIGNORA AND SOMETHING BESIDES REPLIED LUDOVICO WHO SEARCHED HIS POCKETS
1924-132576-0016 SURELY I HAVE NOT LOST IT ADDED HE THE CHEVALIER SAID HE WOULD HAVE WRITTEN MADAM IF HE HAD HAD PEN AND INK AND WAS GOING TO HAVE SENT A VERY LONG MESSAGE WHEN THE SENTINEL ENTERED THE ROOM
1924-132576-0017 BUT NOT BEFORE HE HAD GIVE ME THIS LUDOVICO THEN DREW FORTH A MINIATURE FROM HIS BOSOM WHICH EMILY RECEIVED WITH A TREMBLING HAND AND PERCEIVED TO BE A PORTRAIT OF HERSELF
1924-132576-0018 AS HE GAVE ME THE PICTURE THAT THIS HAS BEEN MY COMPANION AND ONLY SOLACE IN ALL MY MISFORTUNES TELL HER THAT I HAVE WORN IT NEXT MY HEART AND THAT I SENT IT HER AS THE PLEDGE OF AN AFFECTION WHICH CAN NEVER DIE
1924-132576-0019 BUT TO HER FOR THE WEALTH OF WORLDS AND THAT I NOW PART WITH IT ONLY IN THE HOPE OF SOON RECEIVING IT FROM HER HANDS TELL HER JUST THEN SIGNORA THE SENTINEL CAME IN AND THE CHEVALIER SAID NO MORE
1924-132576-0020 TO BRING BACK YOUR ANSWER AND HE WOULD INFORM ME
1924-132576-0021 SO THIS I THINK LADY IS THE WHOLE OF WHAT PASSED HOW LUDOVICO SHALL I REWARD YOU FOR YOUR ZEAL SAID EMILY BUT INDEED I DO NOT NOW POSSESS THE MEANS
1924-132576-0022 WHEN CAN YOU SEE THE CHEVALIER AGAIN THAT IS UNCERTAIN SIGNORA REPLIED HE
1924-132576-0023 THERE ARE NOT MORE THAN ONE OR TWO AMONG THEM
1924-132576-0024 I NEED NOT BID YOU REMEMBER LUDOVICO RESUMED EMILY HOW VERY MUCH INTERESTED I AM IN YOUR SEEING THE CHEVALIER SOON AND WHEN YOU DO SO TELL HIM THAT I HAVE RECEIVED THE PICTURE AND WITH THE SENTIMENTS HE WISHED
1924-132576-0025 SAID LUDOVICO MOST CERTAINLY I WILL REPLIED EMILY BUT WHEN SIGNORA AND WHERE THAT MUST DEPEND UPON CIRCUMSTANCES RETURNED EMILY THE PLACE AND THE HOUR MUST BE REGULATED BY HIS OPPORTUNITIES
1924-132576-0026 AS TO THE PLACE MADEMOISELLE SAID ANNETTE THERE IS NO OTHER PLACE IN THE CASTLE BESIDES THIS CORRIDOR WHERE WE CAN SEE HIM IN SAFETY YOU KNOW AND AS FOR THE HOUR IT MUST BE WHEN ALL THE SIGNORS ARE ASLEEP IF THAT EVER HAPPENS
1924-132576-0027 YOU MAY MENTION THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO THE CHEVALIER LUDOVICO SAID SHE CHECKING THE FLIPPANCY OF ANNETTE AND LEAVE THEM TO HIS JUDGMENT AND OPPORTUNITY TELL HIM MY HEART IS UNCHANGED
1924-132576-0028 BUT ABOVE ALL LET HIM SEE YOU AGAIN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND LUDOVICO I THINK IT IS NEEDLESS TO TELL YOU I SHALL VERY ANXIOUSLY LOOK FOR YOU HAVING THEN WISHED HER GOOD NIGHT LUDOVICO DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE
1924-132576-0029 AND EMILY RETIRED TO REST BUT NOT TO SLEEP FOR JOY NOW RENDERED HER AS WAKEFUL AS SHE HAD EVER BEEN FROM GRIEF MONTONI AND HIS CASTLE HAD ALL VANISHED FROM HER MIND LIKE THE FRIGHTFUL VISION OF A NECROMANCER
1924-132576-0030 AND SHE WANDERED ONCE MORE IN FAIRY SCENES OF UNFADING HAPPINESS AS WHEN BENEATH THE BEAM OF SUMMER MOONS THE DISTANT WOODS AMONG OR BY SOME FLOOD ALL SILVER'D WITH THE GLEAM
1924-132576-0031 THE SOFT EMBODIED FAYS THRO AIRY PORTALS STREAM A WEEK ELAPSED BEFORE LUDOVICO AGAIN VISITED THE PRISON FOR THE SENTINELS DURING THAT PERIOD WERE MEN IN WHOM HE COULD NOT CONFIDE
1924-132576-0032 AND HE FEARED TO AWAKEN CURIOSITY BY ASKING TO SEE THEIR PRISONER IN THIS INTERVAL HE COMMUNICATED TO EMILY TERRIFIC REPORTS OF WHAT WAS PASSING IN THE CASTLE OF RIOTS QUARRELS AND OF CAROUSALS MORE ALARMING THAN EITHER
1924-132576-0033 WHILE FROM SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HE MENTIONED SHE NOT ONLY DOUBTED WHETHER MONTONI MEANT EVER TO RELEASE HER BUT GREATLY FEARED THAT HE HAD DESIGNS CONCERNING HER SUCH AS SHE HAD FORMERLY DREADED
1924-132576-0034 HER NAME WAS FREQUENTLY MENTIONED IN THE CONVERSATIONS WHICH BERTOLINI AND VEREZZI HELD TOGETHER AND AT THOSE TIMES THEY WERE FREQUENTLY IN CONTENTION
1924-132576-0035 THE CAUSE OF THEM HOWEVER APPEARED TO BE OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE FOR SHE THOUGHT SHE SAW DESTRUCTION APPROACHING IN MANY FORMS AND HER ENTREATIES TO LUDOVICO TO CONTRIVE AN ESCAPE AND TO SEE THE PRISONER AGAIN
1924-132576-0036 WERE MORE URGENT THAN EVER AT LENGTH HE INFORMED HER THAT HE HAD AGAIN VISITED THE CHEVALIER WHO HAD DIRECTED HIM TO CONFIDE IN THE GUARD OF THE PRISON
1924-132576-0037 FROM WHOM HE HAD ALREADY RECEIVED SOME INSTANCES OF KINDNESS AND WHO HAD PROMISED TO PERMIT HIS GOING INTO THE CASTLE FOR HALF AN HOUR ON THE ENSUING NIGHT WHEN MONTONI AND HIS COMPANIONS SHOULD BE ENGAGED
1924-132576-0038 AT THEIR CAROUSALS THIS WAS KIND TO BE SURE ADDED LUDOVICO BUT SEBASTIAN KNOWS HE RUNS NO RISQUE IN LETTING THE CHEVALIER OUT FOR
1924-132576-0039 IF HE CAN GET BEYOND THE BARS AND IRON DOORS OF THE CASTLE HE MUST BE CUNNING INDEED BUT THE CHEVALIER DESIRED ME SIGNORA
1924-132576-0040 AND TO BEG YOU WOULD ALLOW HIM TO VISIT YOU THIS NIGHT IF IT WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT FOR THAT HE COULD NO LONGER LIVE UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITHOUT SEEING YOU THE HOUR HE SAID HE COULD NOT MENTION FOR IT MUST DEPEND ON CIRCUMSTANCES
1924-132576-0041 JUST AS YOU SAID SIGNORA AND THE PLACE HE DESIRED YOU WOULD APPOINT AS KNOWING WHICH WAS BEST FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY EMILY WAS NOW SO MUCH AGITATED BY THE NEAR PROSPECT OF MEETING VALANCOURT
1924-132576-0042 BY THE APPREHENSION OF MEETING ANY OF MONTONI'S GUESTS ON THEIR WAY TO THEIR ROOMS AND SHE DISMISSED THE SCRUPLES WHICH DELICACY OPPOSED NOW THAT A SERIOUS DANGER WAS TO BE AVOIDED BY ENCOUNTERING THEM
1924-132576-0043 IT WAS SETTLED THEREFORE THAT THE CHEVALIER SHOULD MEET HER IN THE CORRIDOR AT THAT HOUR OF THE NIGHT WHICH LUDOVICO WHO WAS TO BE UPON THE WATCH SHOULD JUDGE SAFEST AND EMILY
1924-132576-0044 AS MAY BE IMAGINED PASSED THIS INTERVAL IN A TUMULT OF HOPE AND JOY ANXIETY AND IMPATIENCE NEVER SINCE HER RESIDENCE IN THE CASTLE HAD SHE WATCHED WITH SO MUCH PLEASURE THE SUN SET BEHIND THE MOUNTAINS
1924-132576-0045 AND TWILIGHT SHADE AND DARKNESS VEIL THE SCENE AS ON THIS EVENING SHE COUNTED THE NOTES OF THE GREAT CLOCK AND LISTENED TO THE STEPS OF THE SENTINELS
1924-132576-0046 THAT ANOTHER HOUR WAS GONE O VALANCOURT SAID SHE AFTER ALL I HAVE SUFFERED
1924-132576-0047 WHEN I THOUGHT I SHOULD NEVER NEVER SEE YOU MORE WE ARE STILL TO MEET AGAIN O I HAVE ENDURED GRIEF AND ANXIETY AND TERROR AND LET ME THEN NOT SINK BENEATH THIS JOY
1924-132576-0048 THESE WERE MOMENTS WHEN IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO FEEL EMOTIONS OF REGRET OR MELANCHOLY FOR ANY ORDINARY INTERESTS EVEN THE REFLECTION THAT SHE HAD RESIGNED THE ESTATES
1924-132576-0049 WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A PROVISION FOR HERSELF AND VALANCOURT FOR LIFE THREW ONLY A LIGHT AND TRANSIENT SHADE UPON HER SPIRITS THE IDEA OF VALANCOURT AND THAT SHE SHOULD SEE HIM SO SOON ALONE OCCUPIED HER HEART
1924-132576-0050 AT LENGTH THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE SHE OPENED THE DOOR TO LISTEN IF ANY NOISE WAS IN THE CASTLE AND HEARD ONLY DISTANT SHOUTS OF RIOT AND LAUGHTER ECHOED FEEBLY ALONG THE GALLERY
1924-132576-0051 SHE GUESSED THAT THE SIGNOR AND HIS GUESTS WERE AT THE BANQUET THEY ARE NOW ENGAGED FOR THE NIGHT SAID SHE AND VALANCOURT WILL SOON BE HERE HAVING SOFTLY CLOSED THE DOOR
1924-132576-0052 SHE PACED THE ROOM WITH IMPATIENT STEPS AND OFTEN WENT TO THE CASEMENT TO LISTEN FOR THE LUTE BUT ALL WAS SILENT AND HER AGITATION EVERY MOMENT INCREASING SHE WAS AT LENGTH UNABLE TO SUPPORT HERSELF
1924-132576-0053 AND SAT DOWN BY THE WINDOW ANNETTE WHOM SHE DETAINED WAS IN THE MEANTIME AS LOQUACIOUS AS USUAL BUT EMILY HEARD SCARCELY ANY THING SHE SAID AND HAVING AT LENGTH RISEN TO THE CASEMENT
1924-132576-0054 SHE DISTINGUISHED THE CHORDS OF THE LUTE STRUCK WITH AN EXPRESSIVE HAND AND THEN THE VOICE SHE HAD FORMERLY LISTENED TO ACCOMPANIED IT NOW RISING LOVE THEY FANN'D NOW PLEASING DOLE
1924-132576-0055 IN DOUBTFUL JOY AND TENDERNESS AND WHEN THE STRAIN CEASED SHE CONSIDERED IT AS A SIGNAL THAT VALANCOURT WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE PRISON SOON AFTER SHE HEARD STEPS IN THE CORRIDOR THEY WERE THE LIGHT
1924-132576-0056 QUICK STEPS OF HOPE SHE COULD SCARCELY SUPPORT HERSELF AS THEY APPROACHED BUT OPENING THE DOOR OF THE APARTMENT SHE ADVANCED TO MEET VALANCOURT AND IN THE NEXT MOMENT SUNK IN THE ARMS OF A STRANGER
