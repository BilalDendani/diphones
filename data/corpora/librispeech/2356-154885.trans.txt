2356-154885-0000 I AM RIGHT AGAINST MY HOUSE SEAT OF MY ANCESTORS YORKSHIRE TRAGEDY ROOKWOOD PLACE WAS A FINE OLD IRREGULAR PILE OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE
2356-154885-0001 PRESENTING A RICH PICTURESQUE OUTLINE WITH ITS INNUMERABLE GABLE ENDS ITS FANTASTICAL COIGNS AND TALL CREST OF TWISTED CHIMNEYS THERE WAS NO UNIFORMITY OF STYLE ABOUT THE BUILDING YET THE GENERAL EFFECT WAS PLEASING AND BEAUTIFUL
2356-154885-0002 ITS VERY IRREGULARITY CONSTITUTED A CHARM NOTHING EXCEPT CONVENIENCE HAD BEEN CONSULTED IN ITS CONSTRUCTION ADDITIONS HAD FROM TIME TO TIME BEEN MADE TO IT BUT EVERYTHING DROPPED INTO ITS PROPER PLACE AND
2356-154885-0003 AND GLADDEN US LIKE THE DISCOVERY OF A HIDDEN TREASURE SOME SUCH ANCESTRAL HALL WE HAVE OCCASIONALLY ENCOUNTERED IN UNLOOKED FOR QUARTERS IN OUR NATIVE COUNTY OF LANCASTER OR IN ITS SMILING SISTER SHIRE
2356-154885-0004 AND NEVER WITHOUT FEELINGS OF INTENSE DELIGHT REJOICING TO BEHOLD THE FRESHNESS OF ITS ANTIQUITY AND THE GREENNESS OF ITS OLD AGE FOR BE IT OBSERVED IN PASSING A CHESHIRE OR LANCASHIRE HALL TIME HONORED THOUGH IT BE
2356-154885-0005 WITH ITS OFTEN RENOVATED BLACK AND WHITE SQUARES FANCIFULLY FILLED UP WITH TREFOILS AND QUATREFOILS ROSETTES AND OTHER FIGURES SEEMS TO BEAR ITS YEARS SO LIGHTLY THAT ITS AGE
2356-154885-0006 ONLY LENDS IT A GRACE AND THE SAME MANSION
2356-154885-0007 MAY BE SEEN IN ADMIRABLE PRESERVATION IN THE DAYS OF THE YOUTHFUL VICTORIA SUCH IS BRAMALL SUCH MORETON AND MANY ANOTHER WE MIGHT INSTANCE THE FORMER OF THESE HOUSES MAY PERHAPS BE INSTANCED AS THE BEST SPECIMEN OF ITS CLASS
2356-154885-0008 AND ITS CLASS IN OUR OPINION IS THE BEST TO BE MET WITH IN CHESHIRE CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE EITHER TO THE FINISHED DECORATION OF ITS EXTERIOR RICH IN THE CHEQUERED COLORING WE HAVE ALLUDED TO
2356-154885-0009 AND TRULY NATIONAL BEAUTY WITHIN DOORS AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY THAT REAL HEARTY HOSPITALITY FOR WHICH THE SQUIREARCHY OF THIS COUNTRY WAS ONCE SO FAMOUS AH
2356-154885-0010 WHY HAVE THEY BARTERED IT FOR OTHER CUSTOMS LESS SUBSTANTIALLY ENGLISH IT MAY BE MENTIONED THAT A ROAD CONDUCTED THE PASSENGER DIRECTLY THROUGH THE GREAT HALL OF THIS HOUSE LITERALLY OF ENTERTAINMENT WHERE IF HE LISTED
2356-154885-0011 STRONG ALE AND OTHER REFRESHMENTS AWAITED HIS ACCEPTANCE AND COURTED HIS STAY WELL MIGHT OLD KING THE CHESHIRE HISTORIAN IN THE PRIDE OF HIS HONEST HEART EXCLAIM I KNOW DIVERS MEN WHO ARE BUT FARMERS
2356-154885-0012 THAT IN THEIR HOUSEKEEPING MAY COMPARE WITH A LORD OR BARON IN SOME COUNTRIES BEYOND THE SEAS YEA ALTHOUGH I NAMED A HIGHER DEGREE I WERE ABLE TO JUSTIFY IT WE HAVE NO SUCH
2356-154885-0013 GOLDEN FARMERS IN THESE DEGENERATE DAYS THE MANSION WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT BY SIR RANULPH DE ROOKWOOD OR AS IT WAS THEN WRITTEN ROKEWODE THE FIRST OF THE NAME
2356-154885-0014 FROM HIS SOVEREIGN IN REWARD FOR GOOD SERVICE RETIRING THITHER IN THE DECLINE OF LIFE AT THE CLOSE OF THE WARS OF THE ROSES TO SEQUESTRATE HIMSELF FROM SCENES OF STRIFE AND TO CONSULT HIS SPIRITUAL WEAL
2356-154885-0015 IN THE ERECTION AND ENDOWMENT OF THE NEIGHBORING CHURCH IT WAS OF MIXED ARCHITECTURE AND COMBINED THE PECULIARITIES OF EACH SUCCESSIVE ERA RETAINING SOME OF THE STERNER FEATURES OF EARLIER DAYS
2356-154885-0016 THE PERIOD ERE YET THE EMBATTLED MANOR HOUSE PECULIAR TO THE REIGNS OF THE LATER HENRYS HAD BEEN MERGED INTO THE GRACEFUL AND PEACEABLE HALL THE RESIDENCE OF THE ROOKWOODS HAD EARLY ANTICIPATED THE GENTLER CHARACTERISTICS OF A LATER DAY THOUGH IT COULD BOAST LITTLE
2356-154885-0017 OF THAT EXUBERANCE OF EXTERNAL ORNAMENT LUXURIANCE OF DESIGN AND PRODIGALITY OF BEAUTY WHICH UNDER THE SWAY OF THE VIRGIN QUEEN DISTINGUISHED THE RESIDENCE OF THE WEALTHIER ENGLISH LANDOWNER AND RENDERED THE HALL OF ELIZABETH
2356-154885-0018 PROPERLY SO CALLED THE PRIDE AND BOAST OF OUR DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE THE SITE SELECTED BY SIR RANULPH FOR HIS HABITATION HAD BEEN ALREADY OCCUPIED BY A VAST FABRIC OF OAK
2356-154885-0019 WHICH HE IN PART REMOVED THOUGH SOME VESTIGES MIGHT STILL BE TRACED OF THAT ANCIENT PILE A MASSIVE EDIFICE SUCCEEDED WITH GATE AND TOWER COURT AND MOAT COMPLETE SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
2356-154885-0020 TO HAVE ENDURED FOR CENTURIES BUT EVEN THIS PONDEROUS STRUCTURE GREW INTO DISUSE AND SIR RANULPH'S SUCCESSORS REMODELLING REPAIRING ALMOST REBUILDING THE WHOLE MANSION IN THE END SO METAMORPHOSED ITS ASPECT
2356-154885-0021 THAT AT LAST LITTLE OF ITS ORIGINAL AND DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER REMAINED STILL AS WE SAID BEFORE IT WAS A FINE OLD HOUSE THOUGH SOME CHANGES HAD TAKEN PLACE FOR THE WORSE WHICH COULD NOT BE READILY PARDONED BY THE EYE OF TASTE
2356-154885-0022 AS FOR INSTANCE THE DEEP EMBAYED WINDOWS HAD DWINDLED INTO MODERNIZED CASEMENTS OF LIGHTER CONSTRUCTION THE WIDE PORCH WITH ITS FLIGHT OF STEPS LEADING TO THE GREAT HALL OF ENTRANCE HAD YIELDED TO A NARROW DOOR
2356-154885-0023 YET DESPITE ALL THESE CHANGES THE HOUSE OF THE ROOKWOODS FOR AN OLD HOUSE AND AFTER ALL WHAT IS LIKE AN OLD HOUSE WAS NO UNDESIRABLE OR UNCONGENIAL ABODE FOR ANY WORSHIPFUL COUNTRY GENTLEMAN WHO HAD A GREAT ESTATE
2356-154885-0024 THE HALL WAS SITUATED NEAR THE BASE OF A GENTLY DECLINING HILL TERMINATING A NOBLE AVENUE OF LIMES AND PARTIALLY EMBOSOMED IN AN IMMEMORIAL WOOD OF THE SAME TIMBER
2356-154885-0025 WHICH HAD GIVEN ITS NAME TO THE FAMILY THAT DWELT AMONGST ITS ROOK HAUNTED SHADES DESCENDING THE AVENUE
2356-154885-0026 THE EYE WAS FIRST ARRESTED BY A SINGULAR OCTAGONAL TURRET OF BRICK OF MORE RECENT CONSTRUCTION THAN THE HOUSE AND IN ALL PROBABILITY OCCUPYING THE PLACE WHERE THE GATEWAY STOOD OF YORE
2356-154885-0027 THIS TOWER ROSE TO A HEIGHT CORRESPONDING WITH THE ROOF OF THE MANSION AND WAS EMBELLISHED ON THE SIDE FACING THE HOUSE WITH A FLAMINGLY GILT DIAL PEERING LIKE AN IMPUDENT OBSERVER AT ALL THAT PASSED WITHIN DOORS TWO APARTMENTS
2356-154885-0028 WHICH IT CONTAINED WERE APPROPRIATED TO THE HOUSE PORTER DESPOILED OF ITS MARTIAL HONORS THE GATEWAY STILL DISPLAYED THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE FAMILY THE ROOK AND THE FATAL BRANCH CARVED IN GRANITE
2356-154885-0029 WHICH HAD RESISTED THE STORMS OF TWO CENTURIES THOUGH STAINED GREEN WITH MOSS AND MAPPED OVER WITH LICHENS
2356-154885-0030 APPEARED THE HOARY SUMMIT OF A DOVECOT INDICATING THE NEAR NEIGHBORHOOD OF AN ANCIENT BARN CONTEMPORARY WITH THE EARLIEST DWELLING HOUSE AND OF A LITTLE WORLD OF OFFICES AND OUTBUILDINGS BURIED IN THE THICKNESS OF THE FOLIAGE TO THE RIGHT WAS THE GARDEN
2356-154885-0031 THE PLEASAUNCE OF THE PLACE FORMAL PRECISE OLD FASHIONED ARTIFICIAL YET EXQUISITE FOR COMMEND US TO THE BYGONE BEAUTIFUL ENGLISH GARDEN REALLY A GARDEN
2356-154885-0032 WHICH SINCE THE DAYS OF THE INNOVATORS KENT AND HIS BOLD ASSOCIATES CAPABILITY BROWN AND CO HAS OBTAINED SO LARGELY THIS WAS A GARDEN
2356-154885-0033 THERE MIGHT BE SEEN THE STATELY TERRACES SUCH AS WATTEAU AND OUR OWN WILSON IN HIS EARLIER WORKS PAINTED THE TRIM ALLEYS EXHIBITING ALL THE TRIUMPHS OF TOPIARIAN ART THE SIDELONG WALLS OF SHAVEN YEW
2356-154885-0034 THE HOLLY'S PRICKLY ARMS TRIMM'D INTO HIGH ARCADES THE TONSILE BOX WOVE IN MOSAIC MODE OF MANY A CURL
2356-154885-0035 AND GREENEST OF LAWNS WITH ITS ADMONITORY SUN DIAL ITS MARBLE BASIN IN THE CENTRE ITS FOUNTAIN AND CONCHED WATER GOD THE QUAINT SUMMER HOUSE SURMOUNTED WITH ITS GILT VANE THE STATUE GLIMMERING FROM OUT ITS COVERT OF LEAVES
2356-154885-0036 SUGGESTED AND CONTRIVED BY ART TO RENDER NATURE MOST ENJOYABLE AND TO ENHANCE THE RECREATIVE DELIGHTS OF HOME OUT OF DOORS FOR SUCH A GARDEN SHOULD BE WITH LEAST SACRIFICE OF INDOOR COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE
2356-154885-0037 WHEN EPICURUS TO THE WORLD HAD TAUGHT THAT PLEASURE WAS THE CHIEFEST GOOD
2356-154885-0038 HIS LIFE HE TO HIS DOCTRINE BROUGHT
2356-154885-0039 BUT AT THE TIME OF WHICH WE WRITE THIS FAIR GARDEN WAS FOR THE MOST PART A WASTE ILL KEPT AND UNREGARDED
2356-154885-0040 GRASS GREW ON THE GRAVEL WALK SEVERAL OF THE URNS WERE OVERTHROWN
2356-154885-0041 THE FOUNTAIN WAS CHOKED UP AND THE SMOOTH SHAVEN LAWN ONLY RESCUED IT WOULD SEEM FROM THE GENERAL FATE THAT IT MIGHT ANSWER THE PURPOSE OF A BOWLING GREEN AS THE IMPLEMENTS OF THAT GAME SCATTERED ABOUT PLAINLY TESTIFIED
2356-154885-0042 DIVERGING FROM THE GARDEN TO THE HOUSE WE HAVE BEFORE REMARKED THAT THE MORE ANCIENT AND CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF THE PLACE HAD BEEN FOR THE MOST PART DESTROYED LESS BY THE HAND OF TIME THAN TO SUIT THE TASTES OF DIFFERENT PROPRIETORS
2356-154885-0043 THIS HOWEVER WAS NOT SO OBSERVABLE IN THE EASTERN WING WHICH OVERLOOKED THE GARDEN HERE MIGHT BE DISCERNED MANY INDICATIONS OF ITS ANTIQUITY THE STRENGTH AND SOLIDITY OF THE WALLS WHICH HAD NOT BEEN AS ELSEWHERE
2356-154885-0044 MASKED WITH BRICKWORK THE LOW TUDOR ARCHES THE MULLIONED BARS OF THE WINDOWS ALL ATTESTED ITS AGE
2356-154885-0045 COMMUNICATING WITH SUITES OF CHAMBERS FOR THE MOST PART DESERTED EXCEPTING ONE OR TWO WHICH WERE USED AS DORMITORIES AND ANOTHER LITTLE ROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR WITH AN ORIEL WINDOW OPENING UPON THE LAWN
2356-154885-0046 AND COMMANDING THE PROSPECT BEYOND A FAVORITE RESORT OF THE LATE SIR PIERS THE INTERIOR WAS CURIOUS FOR HIS HONEYCOMB CEILING DEEPLY MOULDED IN PLASTER WITH THE ARMS AND ALLIANCES OF THE ROOKWOODS
2356-154885-0047 IN THE CENTRE WAS THE ROYAL BLAZON OF ELIZABETH WHO HAD ONCE HONORED THE HALL WITH A VISIT DURING A PROGRESS AND WHOSE CIPHER E R WAS ALSO DISPLAYED UPON THE IMMENSE PLATE OF IRON WHICH FORMED THE FIRE GRATE
2356-154885-0048 TO RETURN FOR A MOMENT TO THE GARDEN WHICH WE LINGER ABOUT AS A BEE AROUND A FLOWER BELOW THE LAWN THERE WAS ANOTHER TERRACE EDGED BY A LOW BALUSTRADE OF STONE
