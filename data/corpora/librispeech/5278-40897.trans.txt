5278-40897-0000 THE UNEDITED AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF PRIVATE ORTHERIS IF THERE WAS ONE THING ON WHICH GOLIGHTLY PRIDED HIMSELF MORE THAN ANOTHER IT WAS LOOKING LIKE AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN HE SAID IT WAS FOR THE HONOR OF THE SERVICE THAT HE ATTIRED HIMSELF SO ELABORATELY
5278-40897-0001 THERE WAS NO HARM ABOUT GOLIGHTLY NOT AN OUNCE HE RECOGNIZED A HORSE WHEN HE SAW ONE AND COULD DO MORE THAN FILL A CANTLE HE PLAYED A VERY FAIR GAME AT BILLIARDS AND WAS A SOUND MAN AT THE WHIST TABLE
5278-40897-0002 EVERYONE LIKED HIM AND NOBODY EVER DREAMED OF SEEING HIM HANDCUFFED ON A STATION PLATFORM AS A DESERTER BUT THIS SAD THING HAPPENED HE WAS GOING DOWN FROM DALHOUSIE AT THE END OF HIS LEAVE RIDING DOWN
5278-40897-0003 IT WAS FAIRLY WARM AT DALHOUSIE AND KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT BELOW HE DESCENDED IN A NEW KHAKI SUIT TIGHT FITTING OF A DELICATE OLIVE GREEN A PEACOCK BLUE TIE WHITE COLLAR AND A SNOWY WHITE SOLAH HELMET
5278-40897-0004 HE PRIDED HIMSELF ON LOOKING NEAT EVEN WHEN HE WAS RIDING POST HE DID LOOK NEAT AND HE WAS SO DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE BEFORE HE STARTED THAT HE QUITE FORGOT TO TAKE ANYTHING BUT SOME SMALL CHANGE WITH HIM
5278-40897-0005 HE LEFT ALL HIS NOTES AT THE HOTEL HIS SERVANTS HAD GONE DOWN THE ROAD BEFORE HIM TO BE READY IN WAITING AT PATHANKOTE WITH A CHANGE OF GEAR THAT WAS WHAT HE CALLED TRAVELLING IN LIGHT MARCHING ORDER
5278-40897-0006 HE WAS PROUD OF HIS FACULTY OF ORGANIZATION WHAT WE CALL BUNDOBUST TWENTY TWO MILES OUT OF DALHOUSIE IT BEGAN TO RAIN NOT A MERE HILL SHOWER BUT A GOOD TEPID MONSOONISH DOWNPOUR
5278-40897-0007 GOLIGHTLY BUSTLED ON WISHING THAT HE HAD BROUGHT AN UMBRELLA THE DUST ON THE ROADS TURNED INTO MUD AND THE PONY MIRED A GOOD DEAL SO DID GOLIGHTLY'S KHAKI GAITERS BUT HE KEPT ON STEADILY AND TRIED TO THINK HOW PLEASANT THE COOLTH WAS
5278-40897-0008 HIS NEXT PONY WAS RATHER A BRUTE AT STARTING AND GOLIGHTLY'S HANDS BEING SLIPPERY WITH THE RAIN CONTRIVED TO GET RID OF GOLIGHTLY AT A CORNER HE CHASED THE ANIMAL CAUGHT IT AND WENT AHEAD BRISKLY
5278-40897-0009 THE SPILL HAD NOT IMPROVED HIS CLOTHES OR HIS TEMPER AND HE HAD LOST ONE SPUR HE KEPT THE OTHER ONE EMPLOYED BY THE TIME THAT STAGE WAS ENDED THE PONY HAD HAD AS MUCH EXERCISE AS HE WANTED
5278-40897-0010 AND IN SPITE OF THE RAIN GOLIGHTLY WAS SWEATING FREELY AT THE END OF ANOTHER MISERABLE HALF HOUR GOLIGHTLY FOUND THE WORLD DISAPPEAR BEFORE HIS EYES IN CLAMMY PULP
5278-40897-0011 THE RAIN HAD TURNED THE PITH OF HIS HUGE AND SNOWY SOLAH TOPEE INTO AN EVIL SMELLING DOUGH AND IT HAD CLOSED ON HIS HEAD LIKE A HALF OPENED MUSHROOM ALSO THE GREEN LINING WAS BEGINNING TO RUN
5278-40897-0012 GOLIGHTLY DID NOT SAY ANYTHING WORTH RECORDING HERE HE TORE OFF AND SQUEEZED UP AS MUCH OF THE BRIM AS WAS IN HIS EYES AND PLOUGHED ON THE BACK OF THE HELMET WAS FLAPPING ON HIS NECK AND THE SIDES STUCK TO HIS EARS
5278-40897-0013 BUT THE LEATHER BAND AND GREEN LINING KEPT THINGS ROUGHLY TOGETHER SO THAT THE HAT DID NOT ACTUALLY MELT AWAY WHERE IT FLAPPED PRESENTLY THE PULP AND THE GREEN STUFF MADE A SORT OF SLIMY MILDEW WHICH RAN OVER GOLIGHTLY IN SEVERAL DIRECTIONS
5278-40897-0014 THE KHAKI COLOR RAN TOO IT WAS REALLY SHOCKINGLY BAD DYE AND SECTIONS OF GOLIGHTLY WERE BROWN AND PATCHES WERE VIOLET AND CONTOURS WERE OCHRE AND STREAKS WERE RUDDY RED AND BLOTCHES WERE NEARLY WHITE
5278-40897-0015 ACCORDING TO THE NATURE AND PECULIARITIES OF THE DYE
5278-40897-0016 BECAME THOROUGHLY MIXED THE EFFECT WAS
5278-40897-0017 NEAR DHAR THE RAIN STOPPED AND THE EVENING SUN CAME OUT AND DRIED HIM UP SLIGHTLY IT FIXED THE COLORS TOO THREE MILES FROM PATHANKOTE THE LAST PONY FELL DEAD LAME AND GOLIGHTLY WAS FORCED TO WALK
5278-40897-0018 HE PUSHED ON INTO PATHANKOTE TO FIND HIS SERVANTS HE DID NOT KNOW THEN THAT HIS KHITMATGAR HAD STOPPED BY THE ROADSIDE TO GET DRUNK AND WOULD COME ON THE NEXT DAY SAYING THAT HE HAD SPRAINED HIS ANKLE
5278-40897-0019 WHEN HE GOT INTO PATHANKOTE HE COULDN'T FIND HIS SERVANTS HIS BOOTS WERE STIFF AND ROPY WITH MUD AND THERE WERE LARGE QUANTITIES OF DIRT ABOUT HIS BODY THE BLUE TIE HAD RUN AS MUCH AS THE KHAKI SO HE TOOK IT OFF WITH THE COLLAR AND THREW IT AWAY
5278-40897-0020 THEN HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT SERVANTS GENERALLY AND TRIED TO GET A PEG HE PAID EIGHT ANNAS FOR THE DRINK AND THIS REVEALED TO HIM THAT HE HAD ONLY SIX ANNAS MORE IN HIS POCKET OR IN THE WORLD AS HE STOOD AT THAT HOUR
5278-40897-0021 HE WENT TO THE STATION MASTER TO NEGOTIATE FOR A FIRST CLASS TICKET TO KHASA WHERE HE WAS STATIONED THE BOOKING CLERK SAID SOMETHING TO THE STATION MASTER THE STATION MASTER SAID SOMETHING TO THE TELEGRAPH CLERK
5278-40897-0022 THEY ASKED HIM TO WAIT FOR HALF AN HOUR WHILE THEY TELEGRAPHED TO UMRITSAR FOR AUTHORITY SO HE WAITED AND FOUR CONSTABLES CAME AND GROUPED THEMSELVES PICTURESQUELY ROUND HIM JUST AS HE WAS PREPARING TO ASK THEM TO GO AWAY THE STATION MASTER SAID THAT
5278-40897-0023 HE WOULD GIVE THE SAHIB A TICKET TO UMRITSAR
5278-40897-0024 GOLIGHTLY STEPPED INSIDE AND THE NEXT THING HE KNEW WAS THAT A CONSTABLE WAS ATTACHED TO EACH OF HIS LEGS AND ARMS WHILE THE STATION MASTER WAS TRYING TO CRAM A MAILBAG OVER HIS HEAD
5278-40897-0025 THERE WAS A VERY FAIR SCUFFLE ALL ROUND THE BOOKING OFFICE AND GOLIGHTLY RECEIVED A NASTY CUT OVER HIS EYE THROUGH FALLING AGAINST A TABLE BUT THE CONSTABLES WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND THEY AND THE STATION MASTER HANDCUFFED HIM SECURELY
5278-40897-0026 AS SOON AS THE MAIL BAG WAS SLIPPED HE BEGAN EXPRESSING HIS OPINIONS AND THE HEAD CONSTABLE SAID WITHOUT DOUBT THIS IS THE SOLDIER ENGLISHMAN WE REQUIRED LISTEN TO THE ABUSE
5278-40897-0027 THE STATION MASTER TOLD HIM HE WAS
5278-40897-0028 NO MARKS ON THE BODY WHO HAD DESERTED A FORTNIGHT AGO
5278-40897-0029 HE SAID THAT NO LIEUTENANT COULD LOOK SUCH A RUFFIAN AS DID GOLIGHTLY AND THAT HIS INSTRUCTIONS WERE TO SEND HIS CAPTURE UNDER PROPER ESCORT TO UMRITSAR GOLIGHTLY WAS FEELING VERY DAMP AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND THE LANGUAGE HE USED WAS NOT FIT FOR PUBLICATION
5278-40897-0030 EVEN IN AN EXPURGATED FORM THE FOUR CONSTABLES SAW HIM SAFE TO UMRITSAR IN AN INTERMEDIATE COMPARTMENT AND HE SPENT THE FOUR HOUR JOURNEY IN ABUSING THEM AS FLUENTLY AS HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE VERNACULARS ALLOWED
5278-40897-0031 AT UMRITSAR HE WAS BUNDLED OUT ON THE PLATFORM INTO THE ARMS OF A CORPORAL
5278-40897-0032 GOLIGHTLY DREW HIMSELF UP AND TRIED TO CARRY OFF MATTERS JAUNTILY HE DID NOT FEEL TOO JAUNTY IN HANDCUFFS WITH FOUR CONSTABLES BEHIND HIM AND THE BLOOD FROM THE CUT ON HIS FOREHEAD STIFFENING ON HIS LEFT CHEEK THE CORPORAL WAS NOT JOCULAR EITHER
5278-40897-0033 GOLIGHTLY GOT AS FAR AS THIS IS A VERY ABSURD MISTAKE MY MEN WHEN THE CORPORAL TOLD HIM TO STOW HIS LIP AND COME ALONG GOLIGHTLY DID NOT WANT TO COME ALONG HE DESIRED TO STOP AND EXPLAIN
5278-40897-0034 HE EXPLAINED VERY WELL INDEED UNTIL THE CORPORAL CUT IN WITH YOU
5278-40897-0035 BLOOM IN FINE ORFICER YOU ARE I KNOW YOUR REGIMENT
5278-40897-0036 YOU'RE A BLACK SHAME TO THE SERVICE GOLIGHTLY KEPT HIS TEMPER AND BEGAN EXPLAINING ALL OVER AGAIN FROM THE BEGINNING THEN HE WAS MARCHED OUT OF THE RAIN INTO THE REFRESHMENT ROOM AND TOLD NOT TO MAKE A QUALIFIED FOOL OF HIMSELF
5278-40897-0037 THE MEN WERE GOING TO RUN HIM UP TO FORT GOVINDGHAR AND RUNNING UP IS A PERFORMANCE ALMOST AS UNDIGNIFIED AS THE FROG MARCH GOLIGHTLY WAS NEARLY HYSTERICAL WITH RAGE AND THE CHILL AND THE MISTAKE AND THE HANDCUFFS AND THE HEADACHE THAT THE CUT ON HIS FOREHEAD HAD GIVEN HIM
5278-40897-0038 HE REALLY LAID HIMSELF OUT TO EXPRESS WHAT WAS IN HIS MIND WHEN HE HAD QUITE FINISHED AND HIS THROAT WAS FEELING DRY ONE OF THE MEN SAID I'VE EARD A FEW BEGGARS IN THE CLICK BLIND STIFF AND CRACK ON A BIT
5278-40897-0039 BUT I'VE NEVER EARD ANY ONE TO TOUCH THIS ERE ORFICER THEY WERE NOT ANGRY WITH HIM THEY RATHER ADMIRED HIM THEY HAD SOME BEER AT THE REFRESHMENT ROOM AND OFFERED GOLIGHTLY SOME TOO BECAUSE HE HAD SWORE WON'ERFUL
5278-40897-0040 THEY ASKED HIM TO TELL THEM ALL ABOUT THE ADVENTURES OF PRIVATE JOHN BINKLE WHILE HE WAS LOOSE ON THE COUNTRYSIDE AND THAT MADE GOLIGHTLY WILDER THAN EVER
5278-40897-0041 NOW THE BUTT OF A MARTINI IN THE SMALL OF YOUR BACK HURTS A GREAT DEAL AND ROTTEN RAIN SOAKED KHAKI TEARS EASILY WHEN TWO MEN ARE JERKING AT YOUR COLLAR GOLIGHTLY ROSE FROM THE FLOOR FEELING VERY SICK AND GIDDY
5278-40897-0042 WITH HIS SHIRT RIPPED OPEN ALL DOWN HIS BREAST AND NEARLY ALL DOWN HIS BACK HE YIELDED TO HIS LUCK AND AT THAT POINT THE DOWN TRAIN FROM LAHORE CAME IN CARRYING ONE OF GOLIGHTLY'S MAJORS THIS IS THE MAJOR'S EVIDENCE IN FULL
5278-40897-0043 THERE WAS THE SOUND OF A SCUFFLE IN THE SECOND CLASS REFRESHMENT ROOM SO I WENT IN AND SAW THE MOST VILLAINOUS LOAFER THAT I EVER SET EYES ON HIS BOOTS AND BREECHES WERE PLASTERED WITH MUD AND BEER STAINS HE WORE A MUDDY WHITE DUNGHILL SORT OF THING ON HIS HEAD
5278-40897-0044 AND IT HUNG DOWN IN SLIPS ON HIS SHOULDERS WHICH WERE A GOOD DEAL SCRATCHED HE WAS HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF A SHIRT AS NEARLY IN TWO PIECES AS IT COULD BE AND HE WAS BEGGING THE GUARD TO LOOK AT THE NAME ON THE TAIL OF IT AS HE HAD RUCKED THE SHIRT ALL OVER HIS HEAD I COULDN'T AT FIRST SEE WHO HE WAS BUT
5278-40897-0045 FROM THE WAY HE SWORE WHILE HE WRESTLED WITH HIS RAGS
5278-40897-0046 AND SOME GREEN WAR PAINT ON THE FACE AND SOME VIOLET STRIPES ROUND THE NECK I SAW THAT IT WAS GOLIGHTLY HE WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE ME SAID THE MAJOR
5278-40897-0047 AND HE HOPED I WOULD NOT TELL THE MESS ABOUT IT I DIDN'T BUT YOU CAN IF YOU LIKE NOW THAT GOLIGHTLY HAS GONE HOME GOLIGHTLY SPENT THE GREATER PART OF THAT SUMMER IN TRYING TO GET THE CORPORAL AND THE TWO SOLDIERS TRIED BY COURT MARTIAL
