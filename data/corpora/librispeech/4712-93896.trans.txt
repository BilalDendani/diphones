4712-93896-0002 THEN WITH HER LITTLE SCISSORS BY THE AID OF A POCKET LOOKING GLASS SHE MERCILESSLY NIPPED HER EYEBROWS OFF AND THUS INSURED AGAINST AGGRESSIVE ADMIRATION SHE WENT ON HER UNEVEN WAY
4712-93896-0003 WHAT A MOMMET OF A MAID SAID THE NEXT MAN WHO MET HER TO A COMPANION TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES FOR VERY PITY OF HERSELF AS SHE HEARD HIM BUT I DON'T CARE SHE SAID O NO I DON'T CARE

4712-93896-0008 FOR ITS YEARS OF THE DUST AND ASHES OF THINGS OF THE CRUELTY OF LUST AND THE FRAGILITY OF LOVE NEXT DAY THE WEATHER WAS BAD BUT SHE TRUDGED ON THE HONESTY DIRECTNESS AND IMPARTIALITY OF ELEMENTAL
4712-93896-0009 HER EXPERIENCE OF SHORT HIRINGS HAD BEEN SUCH THAT SHE WAS DETERMINED TO ACCEPT NO MORE THUS SHE WENT FORWARD FROM FARM TO FARM IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PLACE WHENCE MARIAN HAD WRITTEN TO HER WHICH SHE DETERMINED TO MAKE USE OF AS A LAST SHIFT ONLY
4712-93896-0010 ITS RUMOURED STRINGENCIES BEING THE REVERSE OF TEMPTING
4712-93896-0011 AND AS ACCEPTANCE IN ANY VARIETY OF THESE GREW HOPELESS APPLIED NEXT FOR THE LESS LIGHT TILL
4712-93896-0012 SHE ENDED WITH THE HEAVY AND COURSE PURSUITS WHICH SHE LIKED LEAST WORK ON ARABLE LAND WORK OF SUCH ROUGHNESS INDEED AS SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE DELIBERATELY VOLUTEERED FOR
4712-93896-0013 TOWARDS THE SECOND EVENING SHE REACHED THE IRREGULAR CHALK TABLE LAND OR PLATEAU BOSOMED WITH SEMI GLOBULAR TUMULI
4712-93896-0014 THE MANY BREASTED WERE SUPINELY EXTENDED THERE WHICH STRETCHED BETWEEN THE VALLEY OF HER BIRTH AND THE VALLEY OF HER LOVE HERE THE AIR WAS DRY AND COLD AND THE LONG CART ROADS WERE BLOWN WHITE AND DUSTY WITHIN A FEW HOURS AFTER RAIN
4712-93896-0015 THERE WERE FEW TREES OR NONE THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE GROWN IN THE HEDGES BEING MERCILESSLY PLASHED DOWN WITH THE QUICKSET BY THE TENANT FARMERS THE NATURAL ENEMIES OF TREE BUSH AND BRAKE IN THE MIDDLE DISTANCE AHEAD OF HER
4712-93896-0016 AND THEY SEEMED FRIENDLY THEY HAD A LOW AND UNASSUMING ASPECT FROM THIS UPLAND THOUGH AS APPROACHED ON THE OTHER SIDE FROM BLACKMOOR IN HER CHILDHOOD
