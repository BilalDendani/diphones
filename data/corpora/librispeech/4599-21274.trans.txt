4599-21274-0000 BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL AND WITH A LONG BREATH OF DELIGHT MARCELLA BOYCE THREW HERSELF ON HER KNEES
4599-21274-0001 AND PROPPING HER FACE UPON HER HANDS DEVOURED THE SCENE
4599-21274-0002 FLANKED ON EITHER SIDE BY GROUPS OF OLD TREES
4599-21274-0003 SOME BEECHES A CEDAR OR TWO GROUPS WHERE THE SLOW SELECTIVE HAND OF TIME HAD BEEN AT WORK FOR GENERATIONS
4599-21274-0004 THE DELIGHTFUL ROUNDNESS OF QUIET MASS AND SHADE AND THERE
4599-21274-0005 STANDING BLACK AGAINST THE SKY BEYOND THE LAWN STRETCHED A GREEN DESCENT INDEFINITELY LONG
4599-21274-0006 ENDING AT LAST IN A FAR DISTANT GAP WHERE A GATE AND A GATE OF SOME IMPORTANCE CLEARLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN
4599-21274-0007 THE SIZE OF THE TREES THE WIDE UPLANDS OF THE FALLING VALLEY TO THE LEFT OF THE AVENUE
4599-21274-0008 THE GREEN BREADTH OF THE VAST LAWN THE UNBROKEN PEACE OF WOOD AND CULTIVATED GROUND ALL CARRIED WITH THEM A CONFUSED GENERAL IMPRESSION OF WELL BEING AND OF DIGNITY
4599-21274-0009 IN THIS IMPRESSION WITH AVIDITY YET AT THE SAME MOMENT SHE NOTICED INVOLUNTARILY THE GATELESS GAP AT THE END OF THE AVENUE THE CHOKED CONDITION OF THE GARDEN PATHS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE LAWN
4599-21274-0010 AND THE UNSIGHTLY TUFTS OF GRASS SPOTTING THE BROAD GRAVEL TERRACE BENEATH HER WINDOW IT IS A HEAVENLY PLACE ALL SAID AND DONE
4599-21274-0011 AND AS HER EYES STEEPED THEMSELVES
4599-21274-0012 THE FROWN DISAPPEARED AGAIN IN THE FORMER LOOK OF GLOWING CONTENT THAT CONTENT OF YOUTH WHICH IS NEVER MERELY PASSIVE NAY RATHER CONTAINS AN INVARIABLE ELEMENT OF
4599-21274-0013 COVETOUS EAGERNESS IT WAS BUT THREE MONTHS OR SO SINCE MARCELLA'S FATHER MISTER RICHARD BOYCE HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE OWNERSHIP OF MELLOR PARK
4599-21274-0014 THE BOYCES AND IT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN SIX WEEKS SINCE MARCELLA HAD RECEIVED HER SUMMONS HOME FROM THE STUDENTS BOARDING HOUSE IN KENSINGTON WHERE SHE HAD BEEN LATELY LIVING
4599-21274-0015 SHE HAD ARDENTLY WISHED TO ASSIST IN THE JUNE SETTLING IN HAVING NOT BEEN ABLE TO APPLY HER MIND TO THE MUSIC OR PAINTING SHE WAS
4599-21274-0016 NOR INDEED TO ANY OTHER SUBJECT WHATEVER SINCE THE NEWS OF THEIR INHERITANCE HAD REACHED HER
4599-21274-0017 MARCELLA HAD BETTER GO ON WITH HER STUDIES AS LONG AS POSSIBLE
4599-21274-0018 AND AS SHE LOOKED
4599-21274-0019 DILAPIDATED FURNITURE AND THEN OUT AGAIN TO WOODS AND LAWNS
4599-21274-0020 AND THAT HER CHILDHOOD WITH ITS SQUALORS AND MISERIES WAS BLOTTED OUT ATONED FOR BY THIS LAST KIND SUDDEN STROKE OF FATE WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN DELAYED SO DEPLORABLY
4599-21274-0021 SINCE NO ONE COULD HAVE REASONABLY EXPECTED THAT AN APPARENTLY SOUND MAN OF SIXTY WOULD HAVE SUCCUMBED IN THREE DAYS
4599-21274-0022 A HUNTER AND SPORTSMAN MUST HAVE RESISTED SUCCESSFULLY A SCORE OF TIMES BEFORE
4599-21274-0023 BEHIND HER ALTOGETHER ITS
4599-21274-0024 RELATIVELY TO THEIR PRESENT POSITION AT LEAST SHE WAS NO LONGER THE SELF CONSCIOUS SCHOOLGIRL
4599-21274-0025 COMPANIONS STINTED IN DRESS POCKET MONEY AND EDUCATION AND FIERCELY
4599-21274-0026 FANCIED SLUR SHE WAS NO LONGER EVEN THE HALF
4599-21274-0027 PAST TWO YEARS ENJOYING HERSELF IN LONDON SO FAR AS THE IRON NECESSITY OF KEEPING HER BOARDING HOUSE EXPENSES DOWN TO THE LOWEST POSSIBLE FIGURE WOULD ALLOW
4599-21274-0028 SHE WAS MARCELLA BOYCE A FINISHED AND GROWN UP YOUNG WOMAN OF TWENTY ONE
4599-21274-0029 MISTER BOYCE OF MELLOR PARK
4599-21274-0030 MIDLAND ENGLAND AND JUST ENTERING ON A LIFE WHICH
4599-21274-0031 PROMISED THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE DEGREE OF INTEREST AND NOVELTY YET
4599-21274-0032 IN THIS QUIET OF THE AUTUMN MORNING
4599-21274-0033 SETTING HER PAST SELF AGAINST HER PRESENT MORE CONSCIOUSLY
4599-21274-0034 RECALLING SCENE AFTER SCENE
4599-21274-0035 SARCASM OR AMUSEMENT
4599-21274-0036 IN THE FINE PLASTIC FACE TURNED TO THE SEPTEMBER WOODS
4599-21274-0037 NINE YEARS OLD THERE WAS THE DOMINANT FACT IN THESE MOTLEY UNCOMFORTABLE YEARS BEHIND HER
4599-21274-0038 SEEMLY AND PLEASANT THINGS OF A HOUSE IN LONDON OF A LARGE AND BRIGHT NURSERY OF A SMILING MOTHER WHO TOOK
4599-21274-0039 OF GAMES LITTLE FRIENDS AND BIRTHDAY PARTIES
4599-21274-0040 THIS EARLIEST SET TO USE A THEATRICAL PHRASE FROM THE SCENERY OF HER CHILDHOOD MARCELLA DID NOT YET ADEQUATELY KNOW
4599-21274-0041 IN THE BACKGROUND OF HER MIND BUT
4599-21274-0042 SUCCEEDED BY ANOTHER PRECISE AS THE FIRST WAS
4599-21274-0043 CLIFF RISING IN TERRACES BEHIND IT AND ALONGSIDE IT
4599-21274-0044 NINE TO FOURTEEN AND WHERE
4599-21274-0045 NOW AT TWENTY ONE
4599-21274-0046 TALL FOR HER AGE AND ENDOWED
4599-21274-0047 ABUNDANCE OF CURLY UNMANAGEABLE HAIR WHEREOF THE BRUSHING AND TENDING SOON BECAME TO A NERVOUS CLUMSY CHILD
4599-21274-0048 ONE OF THE WORST PLAGUES OF HER EXISTENCE
4599-21274-0049 SHE HAD BEEN AN AVERAGE CHILD OF THE QUICK AND CLEVER TYPE
4599-21274-0050 UGLY ROOMS THE DISCIPLINE THE TEACHING THE COMPANIONSHIP OF MISS
4599-21274-0051 YOUNG LADIES TRANSFORMED LITTLE MARCELLA BOYCE FOR THE TIME BEING INTO A DEMON
4599-21274-0052 SHE HATED GETTING UP IN THE WINTRY DARK AND HER COLD
4599-21274-0053 DOZEN OTHERS IN THE COMFORTLESS LAVATORY SHE HATED THE MEALS IN THE LONG SCHOOLROOM WHERE BECAUSE TWICE MEAT WAS FORBIDDEN AND TWICE PUDDING ALLOWED
4599-21274-0054 INVARIABLY HUNGERED FIERCELY FOR MORE MUTTON AND SCORNED HER SECOND COURSE
4599-21274-0055 SHE WAS NOT A FAVOURITE WITH HER COMPANIONS AND SHE WAS A PERPETUAL DIFFICULTY
4599-21274-0056 THE WHOLE OF HER FIRST YEAR WAS ONE CONTINUAL SERIES OF SULKS QUARRELS AND REVOLTS
4599-21274-0057 PERPETUAL COLDS TO TRY THE EFFECTS OF A DAY'S SECLUSION AND SOLITARY CONFINEMENT
4599-21274-0058 AND MIGHT SHE HOPED DO HER GOOD FOR I DO BELIEVE A GREAT PART OF IT'S LIVER OR NERVES
4599-21274-0059 FOR SOME FOURTEEN HOURS THEREFORE ON THESE DAYS OF
4599-21274-0060 MARCELLA WAS LEFT ALMOST WHOLLY ALONE NOTHING BUT A WILD
4599-21274-0061 ROVING DEFIANT EYES IN A PALE
4599-21274-0062 IN TRUTH OF RATHER
4599-21274-0063 FOR THOUGH SHE HAD HER MOVEMENTS OF FIERCE REVOLT
4599-21274-0064 THROWING THE SENNA TEA IN MARTHA'S FACE AND RUSHING DOWNSTAIRS IN HER NIGHTGOWN
4599-21274-0065 SOMETHING GENERALLY INTERPOSED
4599-21274-0066 IT IS TO BE FEARED OR ANY WISH TO BE GOOD BUT ONLY AN ACHING INMOST SENSE OF CHILDISH LONELINESS AND HELPLESSNESS
4599-21274-0067 AND THAT THESE DAYS IN BED REPRESENTED CRISES WHICH MUST BE BORNE WITH
4599-21274-0068 SO SHE SUBMITTED AND PRESENTLY LEARNT UNDER DIRE STRESS OF BOREDOM TO AMUSE HERSELF A GOOD DEAL BY DEVELOPING A NATURAL CAPACITY FOR DREAMING AWAKE
4599-21274-0069 FIGURING GENERALLY AS THE
4599-21274-0070 OF THAT BEAUTIFUL ALEXANDRA THE TOP AND MODEL OF ENGLISH SOCIETY WHOSE PORTRAIT IN THE WINDOW OF THE LITTLE
4599-21274-0071 THE SMALL COUNTRY TOWN NEAR CLIFF HOUSE HAD
4599-21274-0072 ON A DREARY WALK AND HAD EVER SINCE
4599-21274-0073 DREAMS MARCELLA HAD NO FAIRY TALES
4599-21274-0074 WHO CAME TO SEEM TO HER BEFORE LONG
4599-21274-0075 EITHER BY SOME LOOK OR
4599-21274-0076 OR BY THROWING HERSELF IN FRONT OF THE
4599-21274-0077 IMAGINATIVE CHILD WELL AWARE IN SPITE OF APPEARANCES
4599-21274-0078 ARISTOCRATIC RELATIONS THEN WHEN THE PRINCESS HAD HELD OUT A GRACIOUS HAND AND SMILED ALL WAS DELIGHT MARCELLA GREW UP ON THE INSTANT
4599-21274-0079 GENERALLY OF WHITE MUSLIN WITH CHERRY COLOURED RIBBONS SHE WENT HERE AND THERE WITH THE PRINCESS LAUGHING AND TALKING QUITE CALMLY WITH THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN THE LAND
4599-21274-0080 HER ROMANTIC FRIENDSHIP WITH THE ADORED OF ENGLAND MAKING HER ALL THE TIME THE OBSERVED OF ALL OBSERVERS BRINGING HER A THOUSAND
4599-21274-0081 FLOATING IN THE SOFTEST SUMMER SEA OF FANCY SOME LITTLE NOISE WOULD STARTLE HER INTO
4599-21274-0082 COMPLETE THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE PRINCESS'S MAID OF HONOUR INTO MARCIE BOYCE THE PLAIN NAUGHTY CHILD WHOM NOBODY CARED ABOUT
4599-21274-0083 WHO IN CONTRAST TO EVERY OTHER GIRL IN THE SCHOOL HAD NOT A SINGLE PARTY FROCK
4599-21274-0084 TO CHOOSE NEXT MORNING BETWEEN ANOTHER DUMB DAY OF SENNA TEA AND GRUEL
4599-21274-0085 INCE'S OUTLINES OF ENGLISH HISTORY
4599-21274-0086 MARCIE OF CLIFF HOUSE THE MARCELLA OF THE PRESENT SAW WITH A MIXTURE OF AMUSEMENT AND SELF PITY THAT ONE GREAT
4599-21274-0087 IRRITABLE SENSE OF SOCIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HERSELF AND HER COMPANIONS
4599-21274-0088 OF TWO OR THREE NEIGHBOURING TOWNS THEIR TRADESMEN PAPAS WERE SOMETIMES READY TO DEAL ON FAVOURABLE TERMS WITH MISS FREDERICK
4599-21274-0089 THE YOUNG LADIES CONCERNED EVIDENTLY FELT THEMSELVES VERY MUCH AT HOME

4599-21274-0093 WHICH NOW SEEMED SO FAR AWAY HER FATHER HAD AGAIN AND AGAIN POINTED IT OUT TO THE CHILD AND TAUGHT HER TO BE PROUD OF IT AND MORE THAN ONCE HER CHILDISH EYE HAD BEEN CAUGHT
4599-21274-0094 WHO OCCASIONALLY CAME TO SEE THEM
4599-21274-0095 THROUGH ONE INFLUENCE AND ANOTHER
4599-21274-0096 THERE THEY WERE NOW THE GLORY AND THE DIGNITY
4599-21274-0097 DRIVING HER PERPETUALLY INTO THE MOST CRUDE AND RIDICULOUS OUTBREAKS

4599-21274-0104 SHE RUSHED UP TO THE TOP TERRACE
4599-21274-0105 LAVISHED HER TINY WEEKLY ALLOWANCE THE MAD GAMES OF TIG WHICH SHE LED AND ORGANISED IN THE TOP PLAYGROUND AND THE KINDNESSES OF
4599-21274-0106 IN THE FIRST PLACE A TASTE FOR READING HAD ROOTED ITSELF READING OF THE ADVENTUROUS AND POETICAL KIND THERE WERE TWO OR THREE BOOKS WHICH MARCELLA HAD ABSORBED IN A WAY IT NOW MADE HER
4599-21274-0107 ENVIOUS TO REMEMBER FOR AT TWENTY ONE PEOPLE WHO TAKE INTEREST IN MANY THINGS AND ARE IN A HURRY TO HAVE OPINIONS
4599-21274-0108 BOOKS RATHER THAN READ THEM MUST USE INDEED AS BEST THEY MAY A SCATTERED AND DISTRACTED MIND
4599-21274-0109 AS PRETENDERS BUT AT THIRTEEN WHAT CONCENTRATION WHAT DEVOTION WHAT JOY ONE OF THESE
4599-21274-0110 AUNT HAD GIVEN HER SHE PROBABLY NEVER READ ANY OF THEM THROUGH SHE HAD NOT A PARTICLE OF INDUSTRY OR METHOD IN HER COMPOSITION BUT SHE LIVED IN THEM THE PARTS WHICH IT
4599-21274-0111 BUT THE SCENES AND PASSAGES
4599-21274-0112 AND AN ADORATION TO TAKE THE ADORATION FIRST
4599-21274-0113 MARMION TO THE KIND OFFICES OF THE
4599-21274-0114 WHO HAPPENED TO BE KNOWN TO SOME OF THE BOYCE FAMILY HE AND HIS WIFE THEY HAD NO CHILDREN DID THEIR DUTY

4599-21274-0116 PASTORAL TALK WITH MISS FREDERICK AS TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF HER PUPIL'S CHARACTER FOR A LONG TIME LITTLE CAME OF IT MARCELLA WAS HARD TO TAME
4599-21274-0117 STORMY BREAST AN OVERMASTERING ABSORBING PASSION FOR THESE TWO PERSONS
4599-21274-0118 BUT FOR HERSELF IT RAISED HER TO ANOTHER PLANE OF EXISTENCE GAVE HER NEW OBJECTS AND NEW STANDARDS
4599-21274-0119 NOW COUNTED TIME ENTIRELY BY SUNDAYS TO SEE THE
4599-21274-0120 RECTOR WAS A CALAMITY HARDLY TO BE BORNE IF THE EXIT OF THE SCHOOL PARTY WERE DELAYED BY ANY ACCIDENT SO THAT MISTER AND MISSUS ELLERTON OVERTOOK THEM IN THE CHURCHYARD
4599-21274-0121 DREARY AFTERNOON OF THE SCHOOL SUNDAY
4599-21274-0122 IN THE NATURAL COURSE OF THINGS

4599-21274-0124 MEANING NOR WAS THE WEEK QUITE BARREN OF SIMILAR DELIGHTS SHE WAS GENERALLY SENT TO PRACTISE ON AN OLD SQUARE PIANO IN ONE OF THE TOP ROOMS
4599-21274-0125 MISSUS ELLERTON'S PONY CARRIAGE MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO PASS ALONG THAT ROAD
4599-21274-0126 ALIVE WITH EXPECTATION
4599-21274-0127 WOULD GO THE MUSIC STOOL AND THE CHILD LEAPT TO THE WINDOW REMAINING FIXED THERE
4599-21274-0128 MISSUS ELLERTON THEN HER MOMENT OF PARADISE WAS OVER
4599-21274-0129 IT ALSO LEFT DEEP MARK A TALL CONSUMPTIVE GIRL AMONG THE CLIFF HOUSE PUPILS
4599-21274-0130 MISS FREDERICK'S HAD FOR SOME TIME TAKEN NOTICE OF MARCELLA AND AT LENGTH WON HER BY NOTHING ELSE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THAN A REMARKABLE GIFT FOR STORY TELLING
4599-21274-0131 SHE WAS NOT HELD STRICTLY TO LESSON HOURS
4599-21274-0132 THERE WAS A BEDROOM AN INTERMEDIATE DRESSING ROOM AND THEN A LITTLE SITTING ROOM BUILT OUT UPON THE TERRACE WITH A WINDOW DOOR
4599-21274-0133 RACKING COUGH BUT MISS FREDERICK WAS DEAF TO THE LATTER
