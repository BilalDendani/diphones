3373-174983-0000 IN THE MEANTIME MADAME GOESLER HAVING ACCOMPLISHED THE JOURNEY FROM PRAGUE IN CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN A WEEK REACHED LONDON WITH THE BLACKSMITH THE ATTORNEY'S CLERK
3373-174983-0001 THE SITTING OF THE COURT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED AND EVERYBODY CONCERNED SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT THE MATTER WAS SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY ALMOST ANY DEPARTURE FROM ROUTINE A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WAS IN CUSTODY
3373-174983-0002 UNLESS A JURY COULD FIND HIM GUILTY LET HIM BE AT ONCE RESTORED TO HIS DUTIES AND HIS PRIVILEGES THE CASE WAS INVOLVED IN DIFFICULTIES BUT
3373-174983-0003 IN THE MEANTIME THE JURY WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN DOWN BY TRAIN EVERY DAY TO HAVE A WALK IN THE COUNTRY IN THE COMPANY OF TWO SHERIFF'S OFFICERS AND WHO HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO DINE AT GREENWICH ONE DAY AND AT RICHMOND ON ANOTHER IN THE HOPE THAT
3373-174983-0004 WERE INFORMED THAT THEY WOULD BE ONCE AGAIN PUT INTO THEIR BOX ON WEDNESDAY BUT MADAME GOESLER REACHED LONDON ON THE SUNDAY MORNING
3373-174983-0005 AND WITH THE PERSONAL ASSISTANCE OF OUR OLD FRIEND MAJOR MACKINTOSH WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MAN MEALYUS HAD CAUSED TO BE MADE FOR HIM IN PRAGUE A KEY WHICH WOULD OPEN THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE IN NORTHUMBERLAND STREET A KEY WAS MADE IN LONDON FROM THE MODEL NOW BROUGHT WHICH DID OPEN THE DOOR
3373-174983-0006 THAT THEN THE MATTER MUST REST FOR EVER UNLESS FURTHER EVIDENCE COULD BE OBTAINED AGAINST YOSEF MEALYUS
3373-174983-0007 EVEN THOUGH HE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE OBTAINED THE USE OF A GREY COAT FOR A FEW HOURS THERE WAS NO TITTLE OF EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT HE HAD EVER HAD THE GREAT COAT ON HIS SHOULDERS OR THAT HE HAD BEEN OUT OF THE HOUSE ON THAT NIGHT
3373-174983-0008 LORD FAWN TO HIS INFINITE DISGUST WAS TAKEN TO THE PRISON IN WHICH MEALYUS WAS DETAINED AND WAS CONFRONTED WITH THE MAN BUT HE COULD SAY NOTHING MEALYUS AT HIS OWN SUGGESTION PUT ON THE COAT AND STALKED ABOUT THE ROOM IN IT BUT LORD FAWN WOULD NOT SAY A WORD
3373-174983-0009 THE PERSON WHOM HE NOW SAW MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE MAN IN THE STREET OR MISTER FINN MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE MAN OR ANY OTHER MAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE MAN LORD FAWN WAS VERY DIGNIFIED VERY RESERVED AND VERY UNHAPPY TO HIS THINKING HE WAS THE GREAT MARTYR OF THIS TRIAL
3373-174983-0010 PHINEAS FINN WAS BECOMING A HERO AGAINST THE TWELVE JURYMEN THE FINGER OF SCORN WOULD NEVER BE POINTED BUT HIS SUFFERINGS MUST ENDURE FOR HIS LIFE MIGHT PROBABLY EMBITTER HIS LIFE TO THE VERY END
3373-174983-0011 LOOKING INTO HIS OWN FUTURE FROM HIS PRESENT POINT OF VIEW HE DID NOT SEE HOW HE COULD EVER AGAIN APPEAR BEFORE THE EYE OF THE PUBLIC AND YET WITH WHAT PERSISTENCY OF CONSCIENCE HAD HE STRUGGLED TO BE TRUE AND HONEST
3373-174983-0012 HE HAD SEEN A MAN IN A GREY COAT AND FOR THE FUTURE WOULD CONFINE HIMSELF TO THAT YOU DID NOT SEE ME MY LORD SAID MISTER EMILIUS WITH TOUCHING SIMPLICITY
3373-174983-0013 MIGHT AT ANY RATE HEAR THE JUDGE'S CHARGE ON THAT DAY WHEN ANOTHER DISCOVERY WAS MADE MORE WONDERFUL THAN THAT OF THE KEY AND THIS WAS MADE WITHOUT ANY JOURNEY TO PRAGUE AND MIGHT NO DOUBT HAVE BEEN MADE ON ANY DAY SINCE THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED
3373-174983-0014 AND IT WAS A DISCOVERY FOR NOT HAVING MADE WHICH THE POLICE FORCE GENERALLY WAS SUBJECTED TO HEAVY CENSURE A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE BOY WAS SEEN PLAYING IN ONE OF THOSE GARDENS THROUGH WHICH THE PASSAGE RUNS WITH A SHORT LOADED BLUDGEON IN HIS HAND
3373-174983-0015 BUT LUCKILY IT ATTRACTED ATTENTION AND HIS LITTLE LORDSHIP TOOK TWO GARDENERS AND A COACHMAN AND ALL THE NURSES TO THE VERY SPOT AT WHICH HE FOUND IT BEFORE AN HOUR WAS OVER HE WAS STANDING AT HIS FATHER'S KNEE DETAILING THE FACT WITH GREAT OPEN EYES
3373-174983-0016 TO TWO POLICEMEN HAVING BY THIS TIME BECOME IMMENSELY PROUD OF HIS ADVENTURE
3373-174983-0017 IT WAS ABOUT A FOOT LONG WITH A LEATHERN THONG TO THE HANDLE WITH SOMETHING OF A SPRING IN THE SHAFT AND WITH THE OVAL LOADED KNOT AT THE END CASED WITH LEATHERN THONGS VERY MINUTELY AND SKILFULLY CUT THEY WHO UNDERSTOOD MODERN WORK IN LEATHER
3373-174983-0018 GAVE IT AS THEIR OPINION THAT THE WEAPON HAD BEEN MADE IN PARIS IT WAS CONSIDERED THAT MEALYUS HAD BROUGHT IT WITH HIM AND CONCEALED IT IN PREPARATION FOR THIS OCCASION IF THE POLICE COULD SUCCEED IN TRACING THE BLUDGEON INTO HIS HANDS OR IN PROVING THAT HE HAD PURCHASED ANY SUCH INSTRUMENT
3373-174983-0019 THEN SO IT WAS THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE EVIDENCE TO JUSTIFY A POLICE MAGISTRATE IN SENDING MISTER EMILIUS TO OCCUPY THE PLACE SO LATELY AND SO LONG HELD BY POOR PHINEAS FINN BUT TILL THAT HAD BEEN DONE THERE COULD BE NOTHING TO CONNECT THE PREACHER WITH THE MURDER
3373-174983-0020 ALL WHO HAD HEARD THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE WERE CONVINCED THAT MISTER BONTEEN HAD BEEN MURDERED BY THE WEAPON LATELY DISCOVERED AND NOT BY THAT WHICH PHINEAS HAD CARRIED IN HIS POCKET
3373-174983-0021 THIS SECOND BLUDGEON WOULD NO DOUBT HELP TO REMOVE THE DIFFICULTY IN REGARD TO PHINEAS BUT WOULD NOT GIVE ATONEMENT TO THE SHADE OF MISTER BONTEEN MEALYUS WAS CONFRONTED WITH THE WEAPON IN THE PRESENCE OF MAJOR MACKINTOSH
3373-174983-0022 HOW IT WAS FOUND IN THE NOBLEMAN'S GARDEN BY THE LITTLE BOY AT THE FIRST MOMENT WITH INSTANT READINESS HE TOOK THE THING IN HIS HAND AND LOOKED AT IT WITH FEIGNED CURIOSITY
3373-174983-0023 BUT WITH ALL HIS PRESENCE OF MIND HE COULD NOT KEEP THE TELL TALE BLOOD FROM MOUNTING YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT MISTER MEALYUS SAID ONE OF THE POLICEMEN PRESENT LOOKING CLOSELY INTO HIS FACE
3373-174983-0024 NOTHING ABOUT THE STICK I NEVER HAD SUCH A STICK OR AS I BELIEVE SAW ONE BEFORE HE DID IT VERY WELL BUT HE COULD NOT KEEP THE BLOOD FROM RISING TO HIS CHEEKS THE POLICEMEN WERE SURE THAT HE WAS THE MURDERER BUT WHAT COULD THEY DO
3373-174983-0025 YOU SAVED HIS LIFE CERTAINLY SAID THE DUCHESS TO HER FRIEND ON THE SUNDAY AFTERNOON THAT HAD BEEN BEFORE THE BLUDGEON WAS FOUND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD HAVE TOUCHED A HAIR OF HIS HEAD SAID MADAME GOESLER WOULD THEY NOT EVERYBODY FELT SURE THAT HE WOULD BE HUNG
3373-174983-0026 WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN AWFUL I DO NOT SEE HOW YOU ARE TO HELP BECOMING MAN AND WIFE NOW FOR ALL THE WORLD ARE TALKING ABOUT YOU
3373-174983-0027 ON THE TUESDAY AFTER THE BLUDGEON WAS FOUND THE TWO LADIES MET AGAIN
3373-174983-0028 WHEN ANY ONE MIGHT HAVE SEEN HIM I DON'T FEEL TO HATE HIM SO VERY MUCH AFTER ALL AS FOR THAT LITTLE WIFE OF HIS SHE HAS GOT NO MORE THAN SHE DESERVED MISTER FINN WILL SURELY BE ACQUITTED NOW
3373-174983-0029 THAT IS ALL SETTLED AND IT IS A SHAME THAT HE SHOULD BE KEPT IN PRISON EVEN OVER TO DAY
3373-174983-0030 OR AT THE VERY LEAST APPOINT HIM SECRETARY TO SOMETHING I DO WISH PLANTAGENET HADN'T BEEN IN SUCH A HURRY ABOUT THAT NASTY BOARD OF TRADE AND THEN HE MIGHT HAVE GONE THERE HE COULDN'T VERY WELL BE PRIVY SEAL UNLESS THEY DO MAKE HIM A PEER YOU WOULDN'T MIND WOULD YOU MY DEAR
3373-174983-0031 I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT THEY WILL CONSOLE MISTER FINN WITH SOMETHING LESS GORGEOUS THAN THAT YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED IN SEEING HIM OF COURSE
3373-174983-0032 WHO WAS SHE YOU WON'T BE ILL NATURED I'LL ENDEAVOUR AT ANY RATE TO KEEP MY TEMPER DUCHESS IT WAS LADY LAURA I SUPPOSED SO THEY SAY SHE IS FRANTIC ABOUT HIM MY DEAR I NEVER BELIEVE THOSE THINGS WOMEN DO NOT GET FRANTIC ABOUT MEN IN THESE DAYS
3373-174983-0033 I DO NOT WONDER THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIM OF COURSE YOU KNOW THAT SHE IS A WIDOW OH YES MISTER KENNEDY HAD DIED LONG BEFORE I LEFT ENGLAND
3373-174983-0034 IT MAY BE SO SAID MADAME GOESLER WHILE THE SLIGHTEST BLUSH IN THE WORLD SUFFUSED HER CHEEK AND I'LL MAKE YOU ANOTHER BET AND GIVE YOU ANY ODDS WHAT IS THAT
3373-174983-0035 INDEED IT WAS FELT TO BE SO INCONVENIENT WHILE IT WAS THOUGHT THAT GENTLEMEN HAD NOT THE ALTERNATIVE THAT SOME MEN BECAME AFRAID OF GOING INTO SOCIETY
3373-174983-0036 SUCH THINGS HAVE BEEN DONE I DO NOT DOUBT SAID MADAME GOESLER WHO HAD CONTRIVED TO AVERT HER FACE WITHOUT MAKING THE MOTION APPARENT TO HER FRIEND WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER WE'LL GET HIM DOWN TO MATCHING AND MANAGE BETTER THAN THAT
3373-174983-0037 I SHOULD THINK THEY'LL HARDLY GO ON WITH THE SESSION AS NOBODY HAS DONE ANYTHING SINCE THE ARREST WHILE MISTER FINN HAS BEEN IN PRISON LEGISLATION HAS COME TO A STANDSTILL ALTOGETHER EVEN PLANTAGENET DOESN'T WORK ABOVE TWELVE HOURS A DAY
3373-174983-0038 AND I'M TOLD THAT POOR LORD FAWN HASN'T BEEN NEAR HIS OFFICE FOR THE LAST FORTNIGHT
3373-174983-0039 THERE'LL BE A FEW DINNERS OF COURSE JUST AS A COMPLIMENT TO THE GREAT MAN BUT LONDON WILL BREAK UP AFTER THAT I SHOULD THINK YOU WON'T COME IN FOR SO MUCH OF THE GLORY AS YOU WOULD HAVE DONE IF THEY HADN'T FOUND THE STICK LITTLE LORD FREDERICK MUST HAVE HIS SHARE YOU KNOW
3373-174983-0040 IT'S THE MOST SINGULAR CASE I EVER KNEW SAID SIR SIMON SLOPE THAT NIGHT TO ONE OF HIS FRIENDS WE CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE HANGED HIM BUT FOR THE TWO ACCIDENTS AND YET NEITHER OF THEM BRINGS US A BIT NEARER TO HANGING ANY ONE ELSE WHAT A PITY
