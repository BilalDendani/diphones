4019-8899-0000 INSTEAD OF RESUMING HIS INVESTIGATION OF SOUTH'S BRAIN WHICH PERHAPS WAS NOT SO INTERESTING UNDER THE MICROSCOPE AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT ORGAN IN LIFE FITZPIERS RECLINED AND RUMINATED ON THE INTERVIEW
4019-8899-0001 GRACE'S CURIOUS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO HIS PRESENCE THOUGH IT WAS AS IF THE CURRENTS OF HER LIFE WERE DISTURBED RATHER THAN ATTRACTED BY HIM ADDED A SPECIAL INTEREST TO HER GENERAL CHARM FITZPIERS WAS IN A DISTINCT DEGREE SCIENTIFIC
4019-8899-0002 BEING READY AND ZEALOUS TO INTERROGATE ALL PHYSICAL MANIFESTATIONS BUT PRIMARILY HE WAS AN IDEALIST HE BELIEVED THAT BEHIND THE IMPERFECT LAY THE PERFECT THAT RARE THINGS WERE TO BE DISCOVERED AMID A BULK OF COMMONPLACE
4019-8899-0003 THAT RESULTS IN A NEW AND UNTRIED CASE MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN OTHER CASES WHERE THE CONDITIONS HAD BEEN PRECISELY SIMILAR REGARDING HIS OWN PERSONALITY AS ONE OF UNBOUNDED POSSIBILITIES BECAUSE IT WAS HIS OWN
4019-8899-0004 NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE FACTORS OF HIS LIFE HAD WORKED OUT A SORRY PRODUCT FOR THOUSANDS HE SAW NOTHING BUT WHAT WAS REGULAR IN HIS DISCOVERY AT HINTOCK OF AN ALTOGETHER EXCEPTIONAL BEING OF THE OTHER SEX WHO FOR NOBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE HAD ANY EXISTENCE
4019-8899-0005 ONE HABIT OF FITZPIERS'S COMMONER IN DREAMERS OF MORE ADVANCED AGE THAN IN MEN OF HIS YEARS WAS THAT OF TALKING TO HIMSELF HE PACED ROUND HIS ROOM WITH A SELECTIVE TREAD UPON THE MORE PROMINENT BLOOMS OF THE CARPET AND MURMURED
4019-8899-0006 THIS PHENOMENAL GIRL WILL BE THE LIGHT OF MY LIFE WHILE I AM AT HINTOCK AND THE SPECIAL BEAUTY OF THE SITUATION IS THAT OUR ATTITUDE AND RELATIONS TO EACH OTHER WILL BE PURELY SPIRITUAL
4019-8899-0007 WOULD BE ABSURD THEY WOULD SPOIL THE ETHEREAL CHARACTER OF MY REGARD AND
4019-8899-0008 FITZPIERS BESTOWED A REGULATION THOUGHT ON THE ADVANTAGEOUS MARRIAGE HE WAS BOUND TO MAKE WITH A WOMAN OF FAMILY AS GOOD AS HIS OWN AND OF PURSE MUCH LONGER BUT AS AN OBJECT OF CONTEMPLATION FOR THE PRESENT AS OBJECTIVE SPIRIT RATHER THAN CORPOREAL PRESENCE
4019-8899-0009 GRACE MELBURY WOULD SERVE TO KEEP HIS SOUL ALIVE AND TO RELIEVE THE MONOTONY OF HIS DAYS HIS FIRST NOTION ACQUIRED FROM THE MERE SIGHT OF HER WITHOUT CONVERSE THAT OF AN IDLE AND VULGAR FLIRTATION WITH A TIMBER MERCHANT'S PRETTY DAUGHTER
4019-8899-0010 PERSONAL INTERCOURSE WITH SUCH AS SHE COULD TAKE NO LOWER FORM THAN INTELLECTUAL COMMUNION AND MUTUAL EXPLORATIONS OF THE WORLD OF THOUGHT SINCE HE COULD NOT CALL AT HER FATHER'S HAVING NO PRACTICAL VIEWS CURSORY ENCOUNTERS IN THE LANE IN THE WOOD
4019-8899-0011 WERE WHAT THE ACQUAINTANCE WOULD HAVE TO FEED ON SUCH ANTICIPATED GLIMPSES OF HER NOW AND THEN REALIZED THEMSELVES IN THE EVENT RENCOUNTERS OF NOT MORE THAN A MINUTE'S DURATION FREQUENTLY REPEATED WILL BUILD UP MUTUAL INTEREST EVEN AN INTIMACY IN A LONELY PLACE
4019-8899-0012 THEIRS GREW AS IMPERCEPTIBLY AS THE TREE TWIGS BUDDED
4019-8899-0013 SPRING WEATHER CAME ON RATHER SUDDENLY THE UNSEALING OF BUDS THAT HAD LONG BEEN SWOLLEN ACCOMPLISHING ITSELF IN THE SPACE OF ONE WARM NIGHT THE RUSH OF SAP IN THE VEINS OF THE TREES COULD ALMOST BE HEARD
4019-8899-0014 THE FLOWERS OF LATE APRIL TOOK UP A POSITION UNSEEN AND LOOKED AS IF THEY HAD BEEN BLOOMING A LONG WHILE
4019-8899-0015 BIRDS BEGAN NOT TO MIND GETTING WET IN DOOR PEOPLE SAID THEY HAD HEARD THE NIGHTINGALE TO WHICH OUT DOOR PEOPLE REPLIED CONTEMPTUOUSLY THAT THEY HAD HEARD HIM A FORTNIGHT BEFORE THE YOUNG DOCTOR'S PRACTICE BEING SCARCELY SO LARGE AS A LONDON SURGEON'S HE FREQUENTLY WALKED IN THE WOOD
4019-8899-0016 INDEED SUCH PRACTICE AS HE HAD HE DID NOT FOLLOW UP WITH THE ASSIDUITY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY FOR DEVELOPING IT TO EXCEPTIONAL PROPORTIONS ONE DAY BOOK IN HAND HE WALKED IN A PART OF THE WOOD WHERE THE TREES WERE MAINLY OAKS
4019-8899-0017 WHICH IS APT TO FILL REFLECTIVE HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE NOT UNDERTAKING MUCH THEMSELVES WITH A SUDDEN UNEASINESS AT THE CONTRAST HE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE A CURIOUS SOUND SOMETHING LIKE THE QUACK OF A DUCK WHICH
4019-8899-0018 WAS NOT COMMON TO HIM LOOKING THROUGH THE TREES FITZPIERS SOON PERCEIVED THE ORIGIN OF THE NOISE THE BARKING SEASON HAD JUST COMMENCED AND WHAT HE HAD HEARD WAS THE TEAR OF THE RIPPING TOOL AS IT PLOUGHED ITS WAY ALONG THE STICKY PARTING BETWEEN THE TRUNK AND THE RIND
4019-8899-0019 MELBURY DID A LARGE BUSINESS IN BARK AND AS HE WAS GRACE'S FATHER AND POSSIBLY MIGHT BE FOUND ON THE SPOT FITZPIERS WAS ATTRACTED TO THE SCENE EVEN MORE THAN HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BY ITS INTRINSIC INTEREST WHEN HE GOT NEARER HE RECOGNIZED AMONG THE WORKMEN
4019-8899-0020 EACH TREE DOOMED TO THIS FLAYING PROCESS WAS FIRST ATTACKED BY CREEDLE WITH A SMALL BILLHOOK HE CAREFULLY FREED THE COLLAR OF THE TREE FROM TWIGS AND PATCHES OF MOSS WHICH INCRUSTED IT TO A HEIGHT OF A FOOT OR TWO ABOVE THE GROUND
4019-8899-0021 AN OPERATION COMPARABLE TO THE LITTLE TOILET OF THE EXECUTIONER'S VICTIM AFTER THIS IT WAS BARKED IN ITS ERECT POSITION TO A POINT AS HIGH AS A MAN COULD REACH IF A FINE PRODUCT OF VEGETABLE NATURE COULD EVER BE SAID TO LOOK RIDICULOUS IT WAS THE CASE NOW
4019-8899-0022 TILL THE AXE MAN CAME AND CUT A RING ROUND IT AND THE TWO TIMOTHYS FINISHED THE WORK WITH THE CROSSCUT SAW AS SOON AS IT HAD FALLEN THE BARKERS ATTACKED IT LIKE LOCUSTS
4019-8899-0023 RUNNING HER TOOL INTO THE SMALLEST BRANCHES BEYOND THE FARTHEST POINTS TO WHICH THE SKILL AND PATIENCE OF THE MEN ENABLED THEM TO PROCEED BRANCHES WHICH IN THEIR LIFETIME HAD SWAYED HIGH ABOVE THE BULK OF THE WOOD AND CAUGHT THE LATEST AND EARLIEST RAYS OF THE SUN AND MOON
4019-8899-0024 YOU SEEM TO HAVE A BETTER INSTRUMENT THAN THEY MARTY SAID FITZPIERS NO SIR SHE SAID HOLDING UP THE TOOL A HORSE'S LEG BONE FITTED INTO A HANDLE AND FILED TO AN EDGE
4019-8899-0025 FITZPIERS SAT DOWN INSIDE THE SHELTER AND WENT ON WITH HIS READING EXCEPT WHEN HE LOOKED UP TO OBSERVE THE SCENE AND THE ACTORS THE THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT SETTLE HERE AND BECOME WELDED IN WITH THIS SYLVAN LIFE BY MARRYING GRACE MELBURY CROSSED HIS MIND FOR A MOMENT
4019-8899-0026 THE SECRET OF QUIET HAPPINESS LAY IN LIMITING THE IDEAS AND ASPIRATIONS THESE MEN'S THOUGHTS WERE CONTERMINOUS WITH THE MARGIN OF THE HINTOCK WOODLANDS AND WHY SHOULD NOT HIS BE LIKEWISE LIMITED A SMALL PRACTICE AMONG THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM BEING THE BOUND OF HIS DESIRES
4019-8899-0027 WHEN IT WAS READY THE MEN WERE CALLED AND FITZPIERS BEING IN A MOOD TO JOIN SAT DOWN WITH THEM THE LATENT REASON OF HIS LINGERING HERE SO LONG REVEALED ITSELF WHEN THE FAINT CREAKING OF THE JOINTS OF A VEHICLE BECAME AUDIBLE AND ONE OF THE MEN SAID HERE'S HE
4019-8899-0028 TURNING THEIR HEADS THEY SAW MELBURY'S GIG APPROACHING THE WHEELS MUFFLED BY THE YIELDING MOSS
4019-8899-0029 WHO KEPT HER SEAT WHERE AND HOW TO DUCK HER HEAD SO AS TO AVOID THE OVERHANGING BRANCHES THEY STOPPED AT THE SPOT WHERE THE BARK RIPPING HAD BEEN TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED
4019-8899-0030 ACCEPTED THEIR SHOUTED INVITATION TO HAVE A DISH OF TEA FOR WHICH PURPOSE HE HITCHED THE HORSE TO A BOUGH GRACE DECLINED TO TAKE ANY OF THEIR BEVERAGE AND REMAINED IN HER PLACE IN THE VEHICLE
4019-8899-0031 AND WARMLY APPRECIATED FITZPIERS'S INVITATION TO SIT DOWN ON THE LOG BESIDE HIM
4019-8899-0032 OBVIOUSLY MUCH PLEASED AT THE CIRCUMSTANCE I WONDER NOW IF MY DAUGHTER KNOWS YOU ARE SO NIGH AT HAND I DON'T EXPECT SHE DO
4019-8899-0033 SHE DOESN'T SEE US WELL NEVER MIND LET HER BE GRACE WAS INDEED QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF FITZPIERS'S PROPINQUITY SHE WAS THINKING OF SOMETHING WHICH HAD LITTLE CONNECTION WITH THE SCENE BEFORE HER THINKING OF HER FRIEND LOST AS SOON AS FOUND MISSUS CHARMOND
4019-8899-0034 TO WHICH GRACE HERSELF HAD HOPED TO BE INTRODUCED BY HER FRIEND'S MEANS SHE WONDERED IF THIS PATRONIZING LADY WOULD RETURN TO HINTOCK DURING THE SUMMER AND WHETHER THE ACQUAINTANCE WHICH HAD BEEN NIPPED ON THE LAST OCCASION OF HER RESIDENCE THERE WOULD DEVELOP ON THE NEXT
4019-8899-0035 MELBURY TOLD ANCIENT TIMBER STORIES AS HE SAT
4019-8899-0036 MARTY WHO POURED OUT TEA WAS JUST SAYING
4019-8899-0037 SAW THAT THE HORSE HAD BECOME RESTLESS
4019-8899-0038 THOUGH SHE REFRAINED FROM SCREAMING MELBURY JUMPED UP IMMEDIATELY BUT NOT MORE QUICKLY THAN FITZPIERS AND WHILE HER FATHER RAN TO THE HORSE'S HEAD AND SPEEDILY BEGAN TO CONTROL HIM
4019-8899-0039 HER SURPRISE AT HIS APPEARANCE WAS SO GREAT THAT FAR FROM MAKING A CALM AND INDEPENDENT DESCENT SHE WAS VERY NEARLY LIFTED DOWN IN HIS ARMS HE RELINQUISHED HER WHEN SHE TOUCHED GROUND AND HOPED SHE WAS NOT FRIGHTENED OH NO NOT MUCH SHE MANAGED TO SAY
4019-8899-0040 WHICH WAS BY NO MEANS AN IMPOSSIBILITY AND JUSTIFIES ANY AMOUNT OF ALARM
4019-8899-0041 THAT OF PRODUCING IN HER AN UNACCOUNTABLE TENDENCY TO TEARFULNESS MELBURY SOON PUT THE HORSE TO RIGHTS AND SEEING THAT GRACE WAS SAFE TURNED AGAIN TO THE WORK PEOPLE HIS DAUGHTER'S NERVOUS DISTRESS HAD PASSED OFF IN A FEW MOMENTS AND SHE SAID QUITE GAYLY TO FITZPIERS AS SHE WALKED WITH HIM TOWARDS THE GROUP
4019-8899-0042 MARTY PREPARED HER A COMFORTABLE PLACE AND SHE SAT DOWN IN THE CIRCLE AND LISTENED TO FITZPIERS WHILE HE DREW FROM HER FATHER AND THE BARK RIPPERS SUNDRY NARRATIVES OF THEIR FATHERS THEIR GRANDFATHERS
4019-8899-0043 OF WHITE WITCHES AND BLACK WITCHES AND THE STANDARD STORY OF THE SPIRITS OF THE TWO BROTHERS WHO HAD FOUGHT AND FALLEN
4019-8899-0044 AND COMPELLED TO RETREAT TO A SWAMP IN THIS VERY WOOD WHENCE THEY WERE RETURNING TO THEIR OLD QUARTERS AT THE RATE OF A COCK'S STRIDE EVERY NEW YEAR'S DAY OLD STYLE HENCE THE LOCAL SAYING ON NEW YEAR'S TIDE A COCK'S STRIDE
4019-8899-0045 IT WAS A PLEASANT TIME THE SMOKE FROM THE LITTLE FIRE OF PEELED STICKS ROSE BETWEEN THE SITTERS AND THE SUNLIGHT AND BEHIND ITS BLUE VEIL STRETCHED THE NAKED ARMS OF THE PROSTRATE TREES THE SMELL OF THE UNCOVERED SAP MINGLED WITH THE SMELL OF THE BURNING WOOD
4019-8899-0046 AND THE STICKY INNER SURFACE OF THE SCATTERED BARK GLISTENED AS IT REVEALED ITS PALE MADDER HUES TO THE EYE MELBURY WAS SO HIGHLY SATISFIED AT HAVING FITZPIERS AS A SORT OF GUEST
4019-8899-0047 BUT GRACE ON WHOM FITZPIERS'S EYES ONLY TOO FREQUENTLY ALIGHTED SEEMED TO THINK IT INCUMBENT UPON HER TO MAKE A SHOW OF GOING AND HER FATHER THEREUPON ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE VEHICLE
4019-8899-0048 AS THE DOCTOR HAD HELPED HER OUT OF IT HE APPEARED TO THINK THAT HE HAD EXCELLENT REASONS FOR HELPING HER IN AND PERFORMED THE ATTENTION LINGERINGLY ENOUGH WHAT WERE YOU ALMOST IN TEARS ABOUT JUST NOW HE ASKED SOFTLY
4019-8899-0049 AND THE WORDS WERE STRICTLY TRUE MELBURY MOUNTED ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEY DROVE ON OUT OF THE GROVE THEIR WHEELS SILENTLY CRUSHING DELICATE PATTERNED MOSSES HYACINTHS PRIMROSES LORDS AND LADIES AND OTHER STRANGE AND ORDINARY PLANTS AND CRACKING UP LITTLE STICKS THAT LAY ACROSS THE TRACK
4019-8899-0050 THEIR WAY HOMEWARD RAN ALONG THE CREST OF A LOFTY HILL WHENCE ON THE RIGHT THEY BEHELD A WIDE VALLEY DIFFERING BOTH IN FEATURE AND ATMOSPHERE FROM THAT OF THE HINTOCK PRECINCTS IT WAS THE CIDER COUNTRY WHICH MET THE WOODLAND DISTRICT ON THE AXIS OF THIS HILL
4019-8899-0051 OVER THE VALE THE AIR WAS BLUE AS SAPPHIRE SUCH A BLUE AS OUTSIDE THAT APPLE VALLEY WAS NEVER SEEN UNDER THE BLUE THE ORCHARDS WERE IN A BLAZE OF BLOOM SOME OF THE RICHLY FLOWERED TREES RUNNING ALMOST UP TO WHERE THEY DROVE ALONG
4019-8899-0052 OVER A GATE WHICH OPENED DOWN THE INCLINE A MAN LEANED ON HIS ARMS REGARDING THIS FAIR PROMISE SO INTENTLY THAT HE DID NOT OBSERVE THEIR PASSING THAT WAS GILES SAID MELBURY WHEN THEY HAD GONE BY WAS IT
4019-8899-0053 MEANWHILE IN THE WOOD THEY HAD COME FROM THE MEN HAD SAT ON SO LONG THAT THEY WERE INDISPOSED TO BEGIN WORK AGAIN THAT EVENING THEY WERE PAID BY THE TON AND THEIR TIME FOR LABOR WAS AS THEY CHOSE
4019-8899-0054 THEY PLACED THE LAST GATHERINGS OF BARK IN ROWS FOR THE CURERS WHICH LED THEM FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM THE SHED AND THUS THEY GRADUALLY WITHDREW AS THE SUN WENT DOWN FITZPIERS LINGERED YET HE HAD OPENED HIS BOOK AGAIN THOUGH HE COULD HARDLY SEE A WORD IN IT
4019-8899-0055 AND SAT BEFORE THE DYING FIRE SCARCELY KNOWING OF THE MEN'S DEPARTURE HE DREAMED AND MUSED TILL HIS CONSCIOUSNESS SEEMED TO OCCUPY THE WHOLE SPACE OF THE WOODLAND AROUND SO LITTLE WAS THERE OF JARRING SIGHT OR SOUND TO HINDER PERFECT UNITY WITH THE SENTIMENT OF THE PLACE
4019-8899-0056 THE IDEA RETURNED UPON HIM OF SACRIFICING ALL PRACTICAL AIMS TO LIVE IN CALM CONTENTMENT HERE AND INSTEAD OF GOING ON ELABORATING NEW CONCEPTIONS WITH INFINITE PAINS
4019-8899-0057 THESE REFLECTIONS DETAINED HIM TILL THE WOOD WAS EMBROWNED WITH THE COMING NIGHT
4019-8899-0058 FROM A BUSH NOT VERY FAR OFF FITZPIERS'S EYES COMMANDED AS MUCH OF THE GROUND IN FRONT AS WAS OPEN ENTERING UPON THIS HE SAW A FIGURE WHOSE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT WAS TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE HE SAT
4019-8899-0059 THE SURGEON WAS QUITE SHROUDED FROM OBSERVATION BY THE RECESSED SHADOW OF THE HUT AND THERE WAS NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD MOVE TILL THE STRANGER HAD PASSED BY THE SHAPE RESOLVED ITSELF INTO A WOMAN'S SHE WAS LOOKING ON THE GROUND AND WALKING SLOWLY
4019-8899-0060 AS IF SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN LOST HER COURSE BEING PRECISELY THAT OF MISTER MELBURY'S GIG FITZPIERS BY A SORT OF DIVINATION JUMPED TO THE IDEA THAT THE FIGURE WAS GRACE'S HER NEARER APPROACH MADE THE GUESS A CERTAINTY
4019-8899-0061 THUS SHE APPROACHED THE HEAP OF ASHES AND ACTING UPON WHAT WAS SUGGESTED BY A STILL SHINING EMBER OR TWO SHE TOOK A STICK AND STIRRED THE HEAP WHICH THEREUPON BURST INTO A FLAME ON LOOKING AROUND BY THE LIGHT THUS OBTAINED
4019-8899-0062 SHE FOR THE FIRST TIME SAW THE ILLUMINED FACE OF FITZPIERS
4019-8899-0063 GRACE GAVE A START AND A SCREAM THE PLACE HAD BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HIM IN HER THOUGHTS BUT SHE HAD NOT EXPECTED TO FIND HIM THERE STILL FITZPIERS LOST NOT A MOMENT IN RISING AND GOING TO HER SIDE I FRIGHTENED YOU DREADFULLY I KNOW HE SAID
4019-8899-0064 HE WAS ACTUALLY SUPPORTING HER WITH HIS ARM AS THOUGH UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS QUITE OVERCOME AND IN DANGER OF FALLING AS SOON AS SHE COULD COLLECT HER IDEAS SHE GENTLY WITHDREW FROM HIS GRASP AND EXPLAINED WHAT SHE HAD RETURNED FOR
4019-8899-0065 IN GETTING UP OR DOWN FROM THE GIG OR WHEN SITTING BY THE HUT FIRE SHE HAD DROPPED HER PURSE
4019-8899-0066 SAID FITZPIERS HE THREW AN ARMFUL OF LAST YEAR'S LEAVES ON TO THE FIRE WHICH MADE THE FLAME LEAP HIGHER AND THE ENCOMPASSING SHADES TO WEAVE THEMSELVES INTO A DENSER CONTRAST TURNING EVE INTO NIGHT IN A MOMENT
4019-8899-0067 BY THIS RADIANCE THEY GROPED ABOUT ON THEIR HANDS AND KNEES TILL FITZPIERS RESTED ON HIS ELBOW AND LOOKED AT GRACE WE MUST ALWAYS MEET IN ODD CIRCUMSTANCES HE SAID AND THIS IS ONE OF THE ODDEST I WONDER IF IT MEANS ANYTHING OH
4019-8899-0068 INDEED MONEY IS OF LITTLE MORE USE AT HINTOCK THAN ON CRUSOE'S ISLAND THERE'S HARDLY ANY WAY OF SPENDING IT
4019-8899-0069 OH HE KNOWS NOTHING OF WHAT I DO NOW THE ADMIRER SAID FITZPIERS SLYLY
4019-8899-0070 THE ADMIRER IS A SUPERFICIAL CONDITIONAL CREATURE AND THIS PERSON IS QUITE DIFFERENT HE HAS ALL THE CARDINAL VIRTUES PERHAPS THOUGH I DON'T KNOW THEM PRECISELY
4019-8899-0071 ACCORDING TO SCHLEIERMACHER THEY ARE SELF CONTROL PERSEVERANCE WISDOM AND LOVE AND HIS IS THE BEST LIST THAT I KNOW I AM AFRAID POOR
4019-8899-0072 HAD NOT MUCH PERSEVERANCE THOUGH
4019-8899-0073 BUT SHE DETERMINED TO GO NO FURTHER IN THIS DIRECTION AND WAS SILENT THESE HALF REVELATIONS MADE A PERCEPTIBLE DIFFERENCE IN FITZPIERS HIS SENSE OF PERSONAL SUPERIORITY WASTED AWAY AND GRACE ASSUMED IN HIS EYES
4019-8899-0074 THE TRUE ASPECT OF A MISTRESS IN HER LOVER'S REGARD MISS MELBURY HE SAID SUDDENLY I DIVINE THAT THIS VIRTUOUS MAN YOU MENTION HAS BEEN REFUSED BY YOU SHE COULD DO NO OTHERWISE THAN ADMIT IT
4019-8899-0075 I DO NOT INQUIRE WITHOUT GOOD REASON GOD FORBID THAT I SHOULD KNEEL IN ANOTHER'S PLACE AT ANY SHRINE UNFAIRLY BUT MY DEAR MISS MELBURY NOW THAT HE IS GONE MAY I DRAW NEAR
4019-8899-0076 I I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT SHE CRIED QUICKLY BECAUSE WHEN A MAN HAS BEEN REFUSED YOU FEEL PITY FOR HIM AND LIKE HIM MORE THAN YOU DID BEFORE
4019-8899-0077 THIS INCREASING COMPLICATION ADDED STILL MORE VALUE TO GRACE IN THE SURGEON'S EYES IT RENDERED HER ADORABLE BUT CANNOT YOU SAY HE PLEADED DISTRACTEDLY I'D RATHER NOT I THINK I MUST GO HOME AT ONCE OH YES SAID FITZPIERS
4019-8899-0078 BUT AS HE DID NOT MOVE SHE FELT IT AWKWARD TO WALK STRAIGHT AWAY FROM HIM AND SO THEY STOOD SILENTLY TOGETHER A DIVERSION WAS CREATED BY THE ACCIDENT OF TWO BIRDS THAT HAD EITHER BEEN ROOSTING ABOVE THEIR HEADS OR NESTING THERE TUMBLING ONE OVER THE OTHER INTO THE HOT ASHES AT THEIR FEET
4019-8899-0079 APPARENTLY ENGROSSED IN A DESPERATE QUARREL THAT PREVENTED THE USE OF THEIR WINGS THEY SPEEDILY PARTED HOWEVER AND FLEW UP AND WERE SEEN NO MORE
4019-8899-0080 THE SPEAKER WAS NEITHER GRACE NOR FITZPIERS BUT MARTY SOUTH WHO APPROACHED WITH HER FACE TURNED UP TO THE SKY IN HER ENDEAVOR TO TRACE THE BIRDS SUDDENLY PERCEIVING GRACE SHE EXCLAIMED OH MISS MELBURY
4019-8899-0081 AND HERE'S MISTER WINTERBORNE SHE CONTINUED SHYLY AS SHE LOOKED TOWARDS FITZPIERS WHO STOOD IN THE BACKGROUND MARTY
4019-8899-0082 WILL YOU COME ALONG AND WITHOUT LINGERING LONGER SHE TOOK HOLD OF MARTY'S ARM AND LED HER AWAY THEY WENT BETWEEN THE SPECTRAL ARMS OF THE PEELED TREES AS THEY LAY AND ONWARD AMONG THE GROWING TREES BY A PATH WHERE THERE WERE NO OAKS AND NO BARKING AND NO FITZPIERS
