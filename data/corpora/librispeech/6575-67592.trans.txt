6575-67592-0000 VERY OFTEN I ADMIT I TRY TO DREAM THAT I AM PRESIDENT WILSON OR MISTER BRYAN OR THE RITZ CARLTON HOTEL
6575-67592-0001 BUT THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT
6575-67592-0002 I WAS WRITING AGAINST TIME THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WAS DRAWING NEARER EVERY DAY AND THE MARKET FOR REMINISCENCES OF LINCOLN WAS EXTREMELY BRISK BUT OF COURSE MIGHT COLLAPSE ANY MOMENT
6575-67592-0003 WRITERS OF MY CLASS HAVE TO CONSIDER THIS SORT OF THING FOR INSTANCE IN THE MIDDLE OF LENT I FIND THAT I CAN DO FAIRLY WELL WITH RECENT LIGHTS ON THE SCRIPTURES
6575-67592-0004 THEN OF COURSE WHEN THE HOT WEATHER COMES THE MARKET FOR CHRISTMAS POETRY OPENS AND THERE'S A FAIRLY GOOD DEMAND FOR VOYAGES IN THE POLAR SEAS
6575-67592-0005 AND THAT SORT OF THING BUT IT'S A WEARING OCCUPATION FULL OF DISAPPOINTMENTS AND NEEDING THE VERY KEENEST BUSINESS INSTINCT TO WATCH EVERY TURN OF THE MARKET I AM AFRAID THAT THIS IS A DIGRESSION
6575-67592-0006 I ONLY WANTED TO EXPLAIN HOW A MAN'S MIND COULD BE SO HARASSED AND OVERWROUGHT
6575-67592-0007 I KNEW AT ONCE IN MY DREAM WHERE AND WHAT I WAS AS SOON AS I SAW THE LUXURY OF THE SURROUNDINGS THE SPACIOUS ROOM WITH ITS VAULTED CEILING LIT WITH STAINED GLASS
6575-67592-0008 THE BEAUTIFUL MAHOGANY TABLE AT WHICH I SAT WRITING WITH A TEN DOLLAR FOUNTAIN PEN THE GIFT OF THE MANUFACTURERS ON EMBOSSED STATIONERY THE GIFT OF THE EMBOSSERS ON WHICH I WAS SETTING DOWN WORDS AT EIGHT AND A HALF CENTS A WORD
6575-67592-0009 AND DELIBERATELY PICKING OUT SHORT ONES THROUGH SHEER BUSINESS ACUTENESS AS SOON AS I SAW THIS I SAID TO MYSELF
6575-67592-0010 NOT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN AN EDITOR OR A SANCTUM BUT I HAVE SENT SO MANY MANUSCRIPTS TO SO MANY EDITORS AND RECEIVED THEM BACK WITH SUCH UNFAILING PROMPTNESS
6575-67592-0011 AS IF I HAD BEEN WIDE AWAKE AS I THUS MUSED REVELLING IN THE CHARM OF MY SURROUNDINGS AND ADMIRING THE LUXURIOUS BLACK ALPACA COAT AND THE DAINTY DICKIE WHICH I WORE THERE WAS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
6575-67592-0012 A BEAUTIFUL CREATURE ENTERED SHE EVIDENTLY BELONGED TO THE PREMISES FOR SHE WORE NO HAT AND THERE WERE WHITE CUFFS UPON HER WRISTS
6575-67592-0013 SHE HAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE BEAUTY OF EFFECTIVENESS SUCH AS IS GIVEN TO HOSPITAL NURSES THIS I THOUGHT TO MYSELF MUST BE MY PRIVATE SECRETARY
6575-67592-0014 I HOPE I DON'T INTERRUPT YOU SIR SAID THE GIRL MY DEAR CHILD I ANSWERED SPEAKING IN THAT FATHERLY WAY IN WHICH AN EDITOR MIGHT WELL ADDRESS A GIRL ALMOST YOUNG ENOUGH TO BE HIS WIFE PRAY DO NOT MENTION IT
6575-67592-0015 SIT DOWN YOU MUST BE FATIGUED AFTER YOUR LABOURS OF THE MORNING LET ME RING FOR A CLUB SANDWICH I CAME TO SAY SIR THE SECRETARY WENT ON THAT THERE'S A PERSON DOWNSTAIRS WAITING TO SEE YOU
6575-67592-0016 MY MANNER CHANGED AT ONCE IS HE A GENTLEMAN OR A CONTRIBUTOR I ASKED HE DOESN'T LOOK EXACTLY LIKE A GENTLEMAN VERY GOOD I SAID HE'S A CONTRIBUTOR FOR SURE
6575-67592-0017 TELL HIM TO WAIT ASK THE CARETAKER TO LOCK HIM IN THE COAL CELLAR AND KINDLY SLIP OUT AND SEE IF THERE'S A POLICEMAN ON THE BEAT IN CASE I NEED HIM VERY GOOD SIR SAID THE SECRETARY I WAITED FOR ABOUT AN HOUR
6575-67592-0018 WROTE A FEW EDITORIALS ADVOCATING THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE SMOKED SOME TURKISH CIGARETTES DRANK A GLASS OF SHERRY AND ATE PART OF AN ANCHOVY SANDWICH THEN I RANG THE BELL BRING THAT MAN HERE I SAID

6575-67592-0034 IN DOUBLE LEADED OLD ENGLISH TYPE I COULD SET UP A PAGE THAT WOULD BE THE DELIGHT OF ALL BUSINESS READERS AND MAKE THIS NUMBER OF THE MAGAZINE A CONSPICUOUS SUCCESS
6575-67592-0035 MY MIND WAS SO ABSORBED THAT I SCARCELY NOTICED THAT OVER AN HOUR ELAPSED BEFORE THE JANITOR RETURNED WELL JONES I SAID AS HE ENTERED HAVE YOU READ THAT MANUSCRIPT YES SIR AND YOU FIND IT ALL RIGHT
