4116-3582-0025 AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO GET HER HERE TOO
4116-3582-0026 BUT POLLY STOOD LIKE A STATUE ALL JASPER'S FRANTIC EFFORTS AT COMFORT UTTERLY FAILED TO THINK THAT PHRONSIE HAD LEFT HER FOR ANY ONE
4116-3582-0027 THE ROOM SEEMED TO BUZZ AND EVERYTHING TO TURN UPSIDE DOWN AND JUST THEN SHE HEARD ANOTHER CRY OH I WANT POLLY I DO WITH A BOUND POLLY WAS AT MISTER KING'S SIDE WITH HER FACE ON HIS COAT

4116-3582-0029 SAID MISSUS WHITNEY ENTHUSIASTICALLY AFTERWARD ASIDE TO MISTER KING
4116-3582-0030 AND SUCH EXQUISITE BROWN EYES THE COMBINATION IS VERY STRIKING HOW DID HER MOTHER EVER LET HER GO SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU COULD PERSUADE HER FATHER I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I WORKED IT RIGHTLY
4116-3582-0031 SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY I WASN'T COMING WITHOUT HER MARIAN IF IT COULD POSSIBLY BE MANAGED THE TRUTH IS THAT PHRONSIE HAD BEEN PINING FOR POLLY TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY BUT FOR HER TO HAVE POLLY
4116-3582-0032 AND HER MOTHER WAS JUST ON THE POINT ALTHOUGH IT ALMOST KILLED HER OF SENDING FOR POLLY AS IF WE SHOULD HAVE LET HER GO HE CRIED IN HIGH DUDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY
4116-3582-0033 SO YOU SEE I WAS JUST IN TIME IN THE VERY NICK OF TIME IN FACT SO HER MOTHER WAS WILLING ASKED HIS DAUGHTER CURIOUSLY OH SHE COULDN'T HELP IT
4116-3582-0034 CRIED MISTER KING BEGINNING TO WALK UP AND DOWN THE FLOOR AND BEAMING AS HE RECALLED HIS SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY THERE WASN'T THE SMALLEST USE IN THINKING OF ANYTHING ELSE I TOLD HER TWOULD JUST STOP POLLY FROM EVER BEING A MUSICIAN IF SHE BROKE OFF NOW AND SO TWOULD YOU KNOW YOURSELF MARIAN
4116-3582-0035 FOR WE SHOULD NEVER GET THE CHILD HERE AGAIN IF WE LET HER GO NOW AND I TALKED WELL I HAD TO TALK SOME BUT WELL THE UPSHOT IS I DID GET HER AND I DID BRING HER AND HERE SHE IS AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS
4116-3582-0036 AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF THEM AND WIPED HIS FACE VIGOROUSLY
4116-3582-0037 SAID MISSUS WHITNEY WHO HADN'T YET GOTTEN OVER HER EXTREME SURPRISE AT THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S COMPLETE SUBJECTION TO THE LITTLE PEPPERS HE WHOM ALL CHILDREN HAD BY INSTINCT ALWAYS APPROACHED SO CAREFULLY AND WHOM EVERY ONE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO CONCILIATE
4116-3582-0038 WELL SHE'S A NICE CHILD HE SAID A VERY NICE CHILD AND STRAIGHTENING HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULLEST HEIGHT AND LOOKING SO VERY HANDSOME THAT HIS DAUGHTER COULD NOT CONCEAL HER ADMIRATION
4116-3582-0039 I SHALL ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF PHRONSIE PEPPER MARIAN SO I HOPE SAID MISSUS WHITNEY AND FATHER I DO BELIEVE THEY'LL REPAY YOU FOR I DO THINK THERE'S GOOD BLOOD THERE THESE CHILDREN HAVE A LOOK ABOUT THEM THAT SHOWS THEM WORTHY TO BE TRUSTED
