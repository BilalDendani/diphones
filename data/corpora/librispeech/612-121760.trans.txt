612-121760-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE KNIGHT ERRANTRY I MUST MENTION THAT MY FATHER NEVER OBJECTED NOW TO MY RIDING HIS LITTLE MARE MISSY AS WE CALLED HER INDEED I HAD GREAT LIBERTY WITH REGARD TO HER
612-121760-0001 AND TOOK HER OUT FOR A TROT AND A GALLOP AS OFTEN AS I PLEASED SOMETIMES WHEN THERE WAS A PRESS OF WORK SHE WOULD HAVE TO GO IN A CART OR DRAG A HARROW FOR SHE WAS SO HANDY THEY COULD DO ANYTHING WITH HER BUT THIS DID NOT HAPPEN OFTEN
612-121760-0002 AND HER CONDITION AT ALL SEASONS OF THE YEAR TESTIFIED THAT SHE KNEW LITTLE OF HARD WORK MY FATHER WAS VERY FOND OF HER AND USED TO TELL WONDERFUL STORIES OF HER JUDGMENT AND SKILL I BELIEVE HE WAS NEVER QUITE WITHOUT A HOPE
612-121760-0003 THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER HE SHOULD FIND HER AGAIN IN THE NEXT WORLD AT ALL EVENTS I AM CERTAIN THAT IT WAS HARD FOR HIM TO BELIEVE THAT SO MUCH WISE AFFECTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN CREATED TO BE AGAIN UNCREATED
612-121760-0004 I CANNOT SAY THAT I EVER HEARD HIM GIVE UTTERANCE TO ANYTHING OF THE SORT BUT WHENCE ELSE SHOULD I HAVE HAD SUCH A FIRM CONVICTION DATING FROM A PERIOD FARTHER BACK THAN MY MEMORY CAN REACH THAT WHATEVER MIGHT BECOME OF THE OTHER HORSES
612-121760-0005 MISSY WAS SURE TO GO TO HEAVEN I HAD A KIND OF NOTION THAT BEING THE BEARER OF MY FATHER UPON ALL HIS MISSIONS OF DOCTRINE AND MERCY SHE BELONGED TO THE CLERGY AND SHARING IN THEIR PRIVILEGES MUST HAVE A CHANCE BEFORE OTHER ANIMALS OF HER KIND
612-121760-0006 I BELIEVE THIS WAS A RIGHT INSTINCT GLAD OF A FOOLISH REASON I AM WISER NOW AND EXTEND THE HOPE TO THE REST OF THE HORSES FOR I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THE GOD WHO DOES NOTHING IN VAIN EVER CREATES IN ORDER TO DESTROY
612-121760-0007 I MADE HASTE TO LEARN MY LESSONS FOR THE MONDAY ALTHOUGH IT WAS BUT AFTER A FASHION MY MIND WAS SO FULL OF THE ADVENTURE BEFORE ME AS SOON AS PRAYERS AND SUPPER WERE OVER THAT IS ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK
612-121760-0008 I CREPT OUT OF THE HOUSE AND AWAY TO THE STABLE IT WAS A LOVELY NIGHT A KIND OF GREY PEACE FILLED EARTH AND AIR AND SKY IT WAS NOT DARK ALTHOUGH RATHER CLOUDY
612-121760-0009 ONLY A DIM DUSK LIKE A VAPOUR OF DARKNESS FLOATED AROUND EVERYTHING I WAS FOND OF BEING OUT AT NIGHT BUT I HAD NEVER BEFORE CONTEMPLATED GOING SO FAR ALONE I SHOULD NOT HOWEVER FEEL ALONE WITH MISSY UNDER ME
612-121760-0010 FOR SHE AND I WERE ON THE BEST OF TERMS ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES SHE WOULD TAKE A FIT OF OBSTINACY AND REFUSE TO GO IN ANY OTHER THAN THE DIRECTION SHE PLEASED OF LATE HOWEVER SHE HAD ASSERTED HERSELF LESS FREQUENTLY IN THIS MANNER
612-121760-0011 I SUPPOSE SHE WAS AWARE THAT I GREW STRONGER AND MORE DETERMINED I SOON MANAGED TO OPEN THE DOOR OF THE STABLE FOR I KNEW WHERE THE KEY LAY IT WAS VERY DARK BUT I FELT MY WAY THROUGH TALKING ALL THE TIME
612-121760-0012 THAT THE HORSES MIGHT NOT BE STARTLED IF I CAME UPON ONE OF THEM UNEXPECTEDLY FOR THE STABLE WAS NARROW AND THEY SOMETIMES LAY A GOOD BIT OUT OF THEIR STALLS I TOOK CARE HOWEVER TO SPEAK IN A LOW TONE
612-121760-0013 THAT THE MAN WHO SLEPT WITH ONLY A WOODEN PARTITION BETWEEN HIM AND THE STABLE MIGHT NOT HEAR I SOON HAD THE BRIDLE UPON MISSY BUT WOULD NOT LOSE TIME IN PUTTING ON THE SADDLE I LED HER OUT GOT ON HER BACK WITH THE HELP OF A STONE
612-121760-0014 AT THE STABLE DOOR AND RODE AWAY SHE HAD SCARCELY BEEN OUT ALL DAY AND WAS RATHER IN THE MOOD FOR A RIDE THE VOICE OF ANDREW WHOM THE NOISE OF HER FEET HAD AROUSED CAME AFTER ME CALLING TO KNOW WHO IT WAS
612-121760-0015 I CALLED OUT IN REPLY FOR I FEARED HE MIGHT ROUSE THE PLACE AND HE WENT BACK COMPOSED IF NOT CONTENTED IT WAS NO USE AT ALL EVENTS TO FOLLOW ME I HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE THE EXTREME STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT BEGAN TO SINK INTO MY SOUL
612-121760-0016 AND MAKE ME QUIET EVERYTHING SEEMED THINKING ABOUT ME BUT NOTHING WOULD TELL ME WHAT IT THOUGHT NOT FEELING HOWEVER THAT I WAS DOING WRONG I WAS ONLY AWED NOT FRIGHTENED BY THE STILLNESS I MADE MISSY SLACKEN HER SPEED
612-121760-0017 AND RODE ON MORE GENTLY IN BETTER HARMONY WITH THE NIGHT NOT A SOUND BROKE THE SILENCE EXCEPT THE ROUGH CRY OF THE LAND RAIL FROM THE FIELDS AND THE CLATTER OF MISSY'S FEET I DID NOT LIKE THE NOISE SHE MADE AND GOT UPON THE GRASS
612-121760-0018 FOR HERE THERE WAS NO FENCE BUT THE MOMENT SHE FELT THE SOFT GRASS OFF SHE WENT AT A SUDDEN GALLOP HER HEAD WAS OUT BEFORE I HAD THE LEAST WARNING OF HER INTENTION SHE TORE AWAY OVER THE FIELD
612-121760-0019 IN QUITE ANOTHER DIRECTION FROM THAT IN WHICH I HAD BEEN TAKING HER AND THE GALLOP QUICKENED UNTIL SHE WAS GOING AT HER UTMOST SPEED THE RAPIDITY OF THE MOTION AND THE DARKNESS TOGETHER FOR IT SEEMED DARKNESS NOW
612-121760-0020 I CONFESS MADE ME FRIGHTENED I PULLED HARD AT THE REINS BUT WITHOUT AVAIL IN A MINUTE I HAD LOST MY RECKONING AND COULD NOT TELL WHERE I WAS IN THE FIELD WHICH WAS A PRETTY LARGE ONE BUT SOON FINDING THAT WE WERE GALLOPING DOWN A HILL
612-121760-0021 SO STEEP THAT I HAD TROUBLE IN RETAINING MY SEAT I BEGAN NOT AT ALL TO MY COMFORT TO SURMISE IN WHAT DIRECTION THE MARE WAS CARRYING ME WE WERE APPROACHING THE PLACE WHERE WE HAD SAT THAT SAME AFTERNOON
612-121760-0022 CLOSE BY THE MOUND WITH THE TREES UPON IT THE SCENE OF MY ADVENTURE WITH WANDERING WILLIE AND OF THE FANCIED MURDER I HAD SCARCELY THOUGHT OF EITHER UNTIL THE SHADOWS HAD BEGUN TO FALL LONG AND NOW IN THE NIGHT WHEN ALL WAS SHADOW
612-121760-0023 BOTH REFLECTIONS MADE IT HORRIBLE BESIDES IF MISSY SHOULD GET INTO THE BOG BUT SHE KNEW BETTER THAN THAT WILD AS HER MOOD WAS SHE AVOIDED IT AND GALLOPED PAST BUT BORE ME TO A FAR MORE FRIGHTFUL GOAL
612-121760-0024 SUDDENLY DROPPING INTO A CANTER AND THEN STANDING STOCK STILL IT WAS A COTTAGE HALF IN RUINS OCCUPIED BY AN OLD WOMAN WHOM I DIMLY RECOLLECTED HAVING ONCE GONE WITH MY FATHER TO SEE A GOOD MANY YEARS AGO
612-121760-0025 AS IT APPEARED TO ME NOW SHE WAS STILL ALIVE HOWEVER VERY OLD AND BEDRIDDEN I RECOLLECTED THAT FROM THE TOP OF HER WOODEN BED HUNG A ROPE FOR HER TO PULL HERSELF UP BY WHEN SHE WANTED TO TURN FOR SHE WAS VERY RHEUMATIC
612-121760-0026 AND THIS ROPE FOR SOME CAUSE OR OTHER HAD FILLED ME WITH HORROR BUT THERE WAS MORE OF THE SAME SORT THE COTTAGE HAD ONCE BEEN A SMITHY AND THE BELLOWS HAD BEEN LEFT IN ITS PLACE
612-121760-0027 NOW THERE IS NOTHING PARTICULARLY FRIGHTFUL ABOUT A PAIR OF BELLOWS HOWEVER LARGE IT MAY BE AND YET THE RECOLLECTION OF THAT HUGE STRUCTURE OF LEATHER AND WOOD WITH THE GREAT IRON NOSE PROJECTING FROM THE CONTRACTING CHEEKS OF IT
612-121760-0028 AT THE HEAD OF THE OLD WOMAN'S BED SO CAPABLE YET SO USELESS DID RETURN UPON ME WITH TERROR IN THE DUSK OF THAT LONELY NIGHT IT WAS MINGLED WITH A VAGUE SUSPICION THAT THE OLD WOMAN WAS A BIT OF A WITCH
612-121760-0029 AND A VERY DOUBTFUL MEMORY THAT SHE HAD BEEN SEEN ON ONE OCCASION BY SOME NIGHT FARER WHEN A FRIGHTFUL STORM WAS RAGING BLOWING AWAY AT THAT VERY BELLOWS AS HARD AS HER SKINNY ARMS AND LEAN BODY COULD WORK THE LEVER
612-121760-0030 SO THAT THERE WAS ALMOST AS GREAT A STORM OF WIND IN HER LITTLE ROOM AS THERE WAS OUTSIDE OF IT IF THERE WAS ANY TRUTH IN THE STORY IT IS EASILY ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE FACT THAT THE POOR OLD WOMAN HAD BEEN A LITTLE OUT OF HER MIND FOR MANY YEARS
612-121760-0031 AND NO WONDER FOR SHE WAS NEARLY A HUNDRED THEY SAID NEITHER IS IT ANY WONDER THAT WHEN MISSY STOPPED ALMOST SUDDENLY WITH HER FORE FEET AND HER NECK STRETCHED FORWARD AND HER NOSE POINTED STRAIGHT FOR THE DOOR OF THE COTTAGE AT A FEW YARDS DISTANCE
612-121760-0032 I SHOULD HAVE FELT VERY QUEER INDEED WHETHER MY HAIR STOOD ON END OR NOT I DO NOT KNOW BUT I CERTAINLY DID FEEL MY SKIN CREEP ALL OVER ME AN ANCIENT ELDER TREE GREW AT ONE END OF THE COTTAGE
612-121760-0033 AND I HEARD THE LONELY SIGH OF A LITTLE BREEZE WANDER THROUGH ITS BRANCHES THE NEXT INSTANT A FRIGHTFUL SOUND FROM WITHIN THE COTTAGE BROKE THE NIGHT AIR INTO WHAT SEEMED A UNIVERSAL SHRIEK MISSY GAVE A PLUNGE
612-121760-0034 TURNED ROUND ON HER HIND LEGS AND TORE FROM THE PLACE I VERY NEARLY LOST MY SEAT BUT TERROR MADE ME CLING THE FASTER TO MY ONLY COMPANION
612-121760-0035 SHE FLEW HOME IT DID NOT TAKE HER A MINUTE TO REACH THE STABLE DOOR THERE SHE HAD TO STOP FOR I HAD SHUT IT WHEN I BROUGHT HER OUT IT WAS MORTIFYING TO FIND MYSELF THERE INSTEAD OF UNDER JOHN ADAM'S HAYLOFT
612-121760-0036 THE RESCUER OF JAMIE DUFF BUT I DID NOT THINK OF THAT FOR A WHILE SHAKEN WITH TERROR AND AFRAID TO DISMOUNT AND BE NEXT THE GROUND I CALLED UPON ANDREW AS WELL AS MY FEAR WOULD PERMIT BUT MY VOICE WAS NEARLY UNMANAGEABLE
612-121760-0037 AND I COULD DO LITTLE MORE THAN HOWL WITH IT IN A FEW MINUTES TO ME A TIME OF AWFUL DURATION FOR WHO COULD TELL WHAT MIGHT BE FOLLOWING ME UP FROM THE HOLLOW ANDREW APPEARED HALF DRESSED AND NOT IN THE BEST OF TEMPERS
612-121760-0038 REMARKING IT WAS AN ODD THING TO GO OUT RIDING WHEN HONEST PEOPLE WERE IN THEIR BEDS EXCEPT HE ADDED I MEANT TO TAKE TO THE HIGHWAY THEREUPON RENDERED MORE COMMUNICATIVE BY THE TRIAL I HAD GONE THROUGH I TOLD HIM THE WHOLE STORY
612-121760-0039 WHAT I HAD INTENDED AND HOW I HAD BEEN FRUSTRATED HE LISTENED SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AND SAYING SOMEONE OUGHT TO SEE IF ANYTHING WAS THE MATTER WITH THE OLD WOMAN TURNED IN TO PUT ON THE REST OF HIS CLOTHES
612-121760-0040 YOU HAD BETTER GO HOME TO BED RANALD HE SAID WON'T YOU BE FRIGHTENED ANDREW I ASKED FRIGHTENED WHAT SHOULD I BE FRIGHTENED AT IT'S ALL WASTE TO BE FRIGHTENED BEFORE YOU KNOW WHETHER THE THING IS WORTH IT
612-121760-0041 MY COURAGE HAD BEEN REVIVING FAST IN THE WARM PRESENCE OF A HUMAN BEING I WAS STILL SEATED ON MISSY TO GO HOME HAVING DONE NOTHING FOR JAMIE AND THEREFORE NOTHING FOR ELSIE
612-121760-0042 AFTER ALL MY GRAND IDEAS OF RESCUE AND RESTORATION WAS TOO MORTIFYING I SHOULD FEEL SO SMALL WHEN I WOKE IN THE MORNING
612-121760-0043 TILL ANDREW CAME OUT AGAIN AND AS I SAT STILL ON THE MARE'S BACK MY COURAGE GRADUALLY ROSE NOTHING INCREASES TERROR SO MUCH AS RUNNING AWAY WHEN HE REAPPEARED I ASKED HIM WHAT DO YOU THINK IT COULD BE ANDREW
612-121760-0044 HOW SHOULD I TELL RETURNED ANDREW THE OLD WOMAN HAS A VERY QUEER COCK I KNOW THAT ALWAYS ROOSTS ON THE TOP OF HER BED AND CROWS LIKE NO COCK I EVER HEARD CROW OR IT MIGHT BE WANDERING WILLIE
612-121760-0045 HE GOES TO SEE HER SOMETIMES AND THE DEMENTED CREATURE MIGHT STRIKE UP HIS PIPES AT ANY UNEARTHLY HOUR I WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH EITHER SUGGESTION BUT THE SOUND I HAD HEARD HAD ALREADY GROWN SO INDISTINCT IN MY MEMORY
612-121760-0046 THAT FOR ANYTHING I COULD TELL IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EITHER THE TERROR WHICH IT WOKE IN MY MIND HAD RENDERED ME INCAPABLE OF MAKING ANY OBSERVATIONS OR SETTING DOWN ANY FACTS WITH REGARD TO IT
612-121760-0047 I COULD ONLY REMEMBER THAT I HAD HEARD A FRIGHTFUL NOISE BUT AS TO WHAT IT WAS LIKE I COULD SCARCELY BEAR THE SMALLEST TESTIMONY I BEGGED ANDREW TO PUT THE SADDLE ON FOR ME AS I SHOULD THEN HAVE MORE COMMAND OF MISSY
612-121760-0048 HE WENT AND GOT IT APPEARING I THOUGHT NOT AT ALL OVER ANXIOUS ABOUT OLD BETTY AND I MEANTIME BUCKLED ON AN OLD RUSTY SPUR WHICH LAY IN THE STABLE WINDOW THE LEATHERS OF IT CRUMBLING OFF IN FLAKES
612-121760-0049 THUS ARMED AND MOUNTED WITH MY FEET IN THE STIRRUPS AND THEREFORE A GOOD PULL ON MISSY'S MOUTH
