1182-134316-0000 SHE FELT HER KNEES SHAKE UNDER HER AND THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO SWOON SHE PUT OUT HER DISENGAGED HAND TO STEADY HERSELF AND IF THE FACE WHICH WAS TURNED TO HIM WAS PALE THERE WAS A STEADFAST RESOLUTION IN HER DARK EYES LET ME RELIEVE YOU OF THAT MISS HOLLAND
1182-134316-0001 HE WRENCHED RATHER THAN TOOK THE BOX FROM HER HAND REPLACED IT CAREFULLY IN THE DRAWER PUSHED THE DRAWER TO AND LOCKED IT EXAMINING THE KEY AS HE WITHDREW IT THEN HE CLOSED THE SAFE AND LOCKED THAT OBVIOUSLY HE SAID PRESENTLY
1182-134316-0002 THERE ARE MANY COURSES WHICH I CAN ADOPT HE SAID SLOWLY I CAN SEND FOR THE POLICE WHEN MY SERVANTS WHOM YOU HAVE DESPATCHED SO THOUGHTFULLY HAVE RETURNED OR I CAN TAKE YOUR PUNISHMENT INTO MY OWN HANDS
1182-134316-0003 SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED SAID THE GIRL COOLLY YOU MAY SEND FOR THE POLICE SHE LEANT BACK AGAINST THE EDGE OF THE DESK HER HANDS HOLDING THE EDGE AND FACED HIM WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A QUAVER I DO NOT LIKE THE POLICE
1182-134316-0004 MUSED KARA WHEN THERE CAME A KNOCK AT THE DOOR KARA TURNED AND OPENED IT AND AFTER A LOW STRAINED CONVERSATION HE RETURNED CLOSING THE DOOR AND LAID A PAPER OF STAMPS ON THE GIRL'S TABLE AS I WAS SAYING I DO NOT CARE FOR THE POLICE AND I PREFER MY OWN METHOD

1182-134316-0006 NEVERTHELESS HE PERSISTED
1182-134316-0007 AND THAT REMOVES ANY TEMPTATION I MIGHT HAVE TO PLACE YOU IN THE HANDS OF THE LAW LET ME SEE HE PURSED HIS LIPS AS HE APPLIED HIS MIND TO THE PROBLEM SHE HALF SAT HALF STOOD WATCHING HIM WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE OF APPREHENSION BUT WITH A HEART WHICH BEGAN TO QUAKE A LITTLE
1182-134316-0008 FOR THREE MONTHS SHE HAD PLAYED HER PART AND THE STRAIN HAD BEEN GREATER THAN SHE HAD CONFESSED TO HERSELF
1182-134316-0009 THAT WAS THE SICKENING MADDENING THING ABOUT IT ALL IT WAS NOT THE FEAR OF ARREST OR OF CONVICTION WHICH BROUGHT A SINKING TO HER HEART IT WAS THE DESPAIR OF FAILURE ADDED TO A SENSE OF HER HELPLESSNESS AGAINST THIS MAN
1182-134316-0010 IF I HAD YOU ARRESTED YOUR NAME WOULD APPEAR IN ALL THE PAPERS OF COURSE HE SAID NARROWLY AND YOUR PHOTOGRAPH WOULD PROBABLY ADORN THE SUNDAY JOURNALS HE ADDED EXPECTANTLY SHE LAUGHED
1182-134316-0011 THAT DOESN'T APPEAL TO ME SHE SAID I AM AFRAID IT DOESN'T HE REPLIED AND STROLLED TOWARDS HER AS THOUGH TO PASS HER ON HIS WAY TO THE WINDOW
1182-134316-0012 HE WAS ABREAST OF HER WHEN HE SUDDENLY SWUNG ROUND AND CATCHING HER IN HIS ARMS HE CAUGHT HER CLOSE TO HIM BEFORE SHE COULD REALISE WHAT HE PLANNED HE HAD STOOPED SWIFTLY AND KISSED HER FULL UPON THE MOUTH IF YOU SCREAM I SHALL KISS YOU AGAIN HE SAID
1182-134316-0013 FOR I HAVE SENT THE MAID TO BUY SOME MORE STAMPS TO THE GENERAL POST OFFICE LET ME GO SHE GASPED NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME HE SAW THE TERROR IN HER EYES AND THERE SURGED WITHIN HIM THAT MAD SENSE OF TRIUMPH
1182-134316-0014 FOR GOD'S SAKE LET ME GO SHE WHISPERED HE FELT HER SHAKING IN HIS ARMS AND SUDDENLY HE RELEASED HER WITH A LITTLE LAUGH AND SHE SANK TREMBLING FROM HEAD TO FOOT UPON THE CHAIR BY HER DESK
1182-134316-0015 NOW YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME WHO SENT YOU HERE HE WENT ON HARSHLY AND WHY YOU CAME I NEVER SUSPECTED YOU I THOUGHT YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE STRANGE CREATURES ONE MEETS IN ENGLAND A GENTLEWOMAN WHO PREFERS WORKING FOR HER LIVING TO THE MORE SIMPLE BUSINESS OF GETTING MARRIED
1182-134316-0016 AND ALL THE TIME YOU WERE SPYING CLEVER VERY CLEVER THE GIRL WAS THINKING RAPIDLY IN FIVE MINUTES FISHER WOULD RETURN
1182-134316-0017 HE MUST HAVE READ HER THOUGHTS FOR HE CAME NEARER AND STOOD OVER HER YOU NEEDN'T SHRINK MY YOUNG FRIEND HE SAID WITH A LITTLE CHUCKLE
1182-134316-0018 GET UP HE HALF LIFTED HALF DRAGGED HER TO HER FEET AND LED HER FROM THE ROOM THEY DESCENDED TO THE HALL TOGETHER AND THE GIRL SPOKE NO WORD PERHAPS SHE HOPED THAT SHE MIGHT WRENCH HERSELF FREE AND MAKE HER ESCAPE INTO THE STREET
1182-134316-0019 BUT IN THIS SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED THE GRIP ABOUT HER ARM WAS A GRIP OF STEEL AND SHE KNEW SAFETY DID NOT LIE IN THAT DIRECTION SHE PULLED BACK AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS THAT LED DOWN TO THE KITCHEN WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME SHE ASKED
1182-134316-0020 I AM GOING TO PUT YOU INTO SAFE CUSTODY HE SAID ON THE WHOLE I THINK IT IS BEST THAT THE POLICE TAKE THIS MATTER IN HAND AND I SHALL LOCK YOU INTO MY WINE CELLAR AND GO OUT IN SEARCH OF A POLICEMAN THE BIG WOODEN DOOR OPENED REVEALING A SECOND DOOR
1182-134316-0021 AND THIS KARA UNBOLTED SHE NOTICED THAT BOTH DOORS WERE SHEETED WITH STEEL THE OUTER ON THE INSIDE AND THE INNER DOOR ON THE OUTSIDE
1182-134316-0022 HE SAID PUSHING HER BACK AS SHE MADE A FRANTIC ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE HE SWUNG THE OUTER DOOR TO AS SHE RAISED HER VOICE IN A PIERCING SCREAM AND CLAPPING HIS HAND OVER HER MOUTH HELD HER TIGHTLY FOR A MOMENT I HAVE WARNED YOU HE HISSED
1182-134316-0023 SHE SAW HIS FACE DISTORTED WITH RAGE SHE SAW KARA TRANSFIGURED WITH DEVILISH ANGER SAW THAT HANDSOME ALMOST GODLIKE COUNTENANCE THRUST INTO HERS
1182-134316-0024 WHEN SHE RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS SHE FOUND HERSELF LYING ON A PLAIN STRETCHER BED SHE SAT UP SUDDENLY
1182-134316-0025 THE CELLAR WAS DRY AND CLEAN AND ITS WALLS WERE ENAMELLED WHITE
1182-134316-0026 THERE WAS A TABLE AND A CHAIR AND A SMALL WASHSTAND AND AIR WAS EVIDENTLY SUPPLIED THROUGH UNSEEN VENTILATORS
1182-134316-0027 SHE EXAMINED THE ROOM CAREFULLY AT THE FARTHERMOST END WAS ANOTHER DOOR AND THIS SHE PUSHED GENTLY AT FIRST AND THEN VIGOROUSLY WITHOUT PRODUCING THE SLIGHTEST IMPRESSION SHE STILL HAD HER BAG A SMALL AFFAIR OF BLACK MOIRE WHICH HUNG FROM HER BELT
1182-134316-0028 IN WHICH WAS NOTHING MORE FORMIDABLE THAN A PENKNIFE A SMALL BOTTLE OF SMELLING SALTS AND A PAIR OF SCISSORS THE LATTER SHE HAD USED FOR CUTTING OUT THOSE PARAGRAPHS FROM THE DAILY NEWSPAPERS WHICH REFERRED TO KARA'S MOVEMENTS
1182-134316-0029 THEY WOULD MAKE A FORMIDABLE WEAPON AND WRAPPING HER HANDKERCHIEF ROUND THE HANDLE TO GIVE IT A BETTER GRIP SHE PLACED IT ON THE TABLE WITHIN REACH SHE WAS DIMLY CONSCIOUS ALL THE TIME THAT SHE HAD HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT THIS WINE CELLAR
1182-134316-0030 SOMETHING WHICH IF SHE COULD RECOLLECT IT WOULD BE OF SERVICE TO HER THEN IN A FLASH SHE REMEMBERED THAT THERE WAS A LOWER CELLAR
1182-134316-0031 IT WAS APPROACHED FROM THE OUTSIDE DOWN A CIRCULAR FLIGHT OF STAIRS THERE MIGHT BE A WAY OUT FROM THAT DIRECTION AND WOULD THERE NOT BE SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN THE UPPER CELLAR AND THE LOWER SHE SET TO WORK TO MAKE A CLOSER EXAMINATION OF THE APARTMENT
1182-134316-0032 THE FLOOR WAS OF CONCRETE COVERED WITH A LIGHT RUSH MATTING THIS SHE CAREFULLY ROLLED UP STARTING AT THE DOOR ONE HALF OF THE FLOOR WAS UNCOVERED WITHOUT REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF ANY TRAP
1182-134316-0033 OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS NO NEED FOR THE FIXTURE AND SHE TAPPED THE FLOOR WITH HER LITTLE KNUCKLE HER HEART STARTED RACING THE SOUND HER KNOCKING GAVE FORTH WAS A HOLLOW ONE
1182-134316-0034 SHE SPRANG UP TOOK HER BAG FROM THE TABLE OPENED THE LITTLE PENKNIFE AND CUT CAREFULLY THROUGH THE THIN RUSHES SHE MIGHT HAVE TO REPLACE THE MATTING AND IT WAS NECESSARY SHE SHOULD DO HER WORK TIDILY SOON THE WHOLE OF THE TRAP WAS REVEALED
1182-134316-0035 THERE WAS AN IRON RING WHICH FITTED FLUSH WITH THE TOP AND WHICH SHE PULLED THE TRAP YIELDED AND SWUNG BACK AS THOUGH THERE WERE A COUNTERBALANCE AT THE OTHER END AS INDEED THERE WAS SHE PEERED DOWN THERE WAS A DIM LIGHT BELOW THE REFLECTION OF A LIGHT IN THE DISTANCE
1182-134316-0036 SHE WAS IN A CELLAR SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN THAT ABOVE HER THE LIGHT SHE HAD SEEN CAME FROM AN INNER APARTMENT WHICH WOULD BE UNDERNEATH THE KITCHEN OF THE HOUSE SHE MADE HER WAY CAUTIOUSLY ALONG STEPPING ON TIP TOE THE FIRST OF THE ROOMS SHE CAME TO WAS WELL FURNISHED
1182-134316-0037 THERE WAS A THICK CARPET ON THE FLOOR COMFORTABLE EASY CHAIRS A LITTLE BOOKCASE WELL FILLED AND A READING LAMP THIS MUST BE KARA'S UNDERGROUND STUDY WHERE HE KEPT HIS PRECIOUS PAPERS
1182-134316-0038 THE ROOM SHE WAS IN WAS ALSO WITHOUT ANY LIGHT WHICH CAME FROM THE FARTHERMOST CHAMBER AS THE GIRL STRODE SOFTLY ACROSS THE WELL CARPETED ROOM SHE TROD ON SOMETHING HARD
1182-134316-0039 THE GIRL WAS BEWILDERED ALMOST PANIC STRICKEN SHE SHRUNK BACK FROM THE ENTRANCE OF THE INNER ROOM FEARFUL OF WHAT SHE WOULD SEE AND THEN FROM THE INTERIOR CAME A SOUND THAT MADE HER TINGLE WITH HORROR IT WAS A SOUND OF A SIGH LONG AND TREMBLING
1182-134316-0040 SHE SET HER TEETH AND STRODE THROUGH THE DOORWAY AND STOOD FOR A MOMENT STARING WITH OPEN EYES AND MOUTH AT WHAT SHE SAW MY GOD SHE BREATHED LONDON
