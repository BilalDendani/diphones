1006-135212-0000 COMING AS IT DID AT A PERIOD OF EXCEPTIONAL DULLNESS IT ATTRACTED PERHAPS RATHER MORE ATTENTION THAN IT DESERVED BUT IT OFFERED TO THE PUBLIC THAT MIXTURE OF THE WHIMSICAL AND THE TRAGIC WHICH IS MOST STIMULATING TO THE POPULAR IMAGINATION
1006-135212-0001 INTEREST DROOPED HOWEVER WHEN AFTER WEEKS OF FRUITLESS INVESTIGATION IT WAS FOUND THAT NO FINAL EXPLANATION OF THE FACTS WAS FORTHCOMING AND THE TRAGEDY SEEMED FROM THAT TIME
1006-135212-0002 IT WOULD BE AS WELL PERHAPS THAT I SHOULD REFRESH THEIR MEMORIES AS TO THE SINGULAR FACTS UPON WHICH THIS COMMENTARY IS FOUNDED THESE FACTS WERE BRIEFLY AS FOLLOWS AT FIVE O'CLOCK ON THE EVENING OF THE EIGHTEENTH OF MARCH
1006-135212-0003 IN THE YEAR ALREADY MENTIONED A TRAIN LEFT EUSTON STATION FOR MANCHESTER IT WAS A RAINY SQUALLY DAY WHICH GREW WILDER AS IT PROGRESSED SO IT WAS BY NO MEANS THE WEATHER IN WHICH ANYONE WOULD TRAVEL WHO WAS NOT DRIVEN TO DO SO BY NECESSITY
1006-135212-0004 THE TRAIN HOWEVER IS A FAVOURITE ONE AMONG MANCHESTER BUSINESS MEN WHO ARE RETURNING FROM TOWN FOR IT DOES THE JOURNEY IN FOUR HOURS AND TWENTY MINUTES WITH ONLY THREE STOPPAGES UPON THE WAY
1006-135212-0005 IN SPITE OF THE INCLEMENT EVENING IT WAS THEREFORE FAIRLY WELL FILLED UPON THE OCCASION OF WHICH I SPEAK THE GUARD OF THE TRAIN WAS A TRIED SERVANT OF THE COMPANY A MAN WHO HAD WORKED FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS WITHOUT A BLEMISH OR COMPLAINT
1006-135212-0006 HIS NAME WAS JOHN PALMER THE STATION CLOCK WAS UPON THE STROKE OF FIVE AND THE GUARD WAS ABOUT TO GIVE THE CUSTOMARY SIGNAL TO THE ENGINE DRIVER WHEN HE OBSERVED TWO BELATED PASSENGERS HURRYING DOWN THE PLATFORM THE ONE WAS
1006-135212-0007 AN EXCEPTIONALLY TALL MAN DRESSED IN A LONG BLACK OVERCOAT WITH ASTRAKHAN COLLAR AND CUFFS I HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT THE EVENING WAS AN INCLEMENT ONE AND THE TALL TRAVELLER HAD THE HIGH WARM COLLAR
1006-135212-0008 TURNED UP TO PROTECT HIS THROAT AGAINST THE BITTER MARCH WIND HE APPEARED AS FAR AS THE GUARD COULD JUDGE BY SO HURRIED AN INSPECTION TO BE A MAN BETWEEN FIFTY AND SIXTY YEARS OF AGE
1006-135212-0009 WHICH OUTPACED THE GENTLEMAN BESIDE HER SHE WORE A LONG FAWN COLOURED DUST CLOAK A BLACK CLOSE FITTING TOQUE AND A DARK VEIL WHICH CONCEALED THE GREATER PART OF HER FACE THE TWO MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE PASSED AS FATHER AND DAUGHTER
1006-135212-0010 THEY WALKED SWIFTLY DOWN THE LINE OF CARRIAGES GLANCING IN AT THE WINDOWS UNTIL THE GUARD JOHN PALMER OVERTOOK THEM NOW THEN SIR LOOK SHARP THE TRAIN IS GOING SAID HE FIRST CLASS THE MAN ANSWERED
1006-135212-0011 THE GUARD TURNED THE HANDLE OF THE NEAREST DOOR IN THE CARRIAGE WHICH HE HAD OPENED THERE SAT A SMALL MAN WITH A CIGAR IN HIS MOUTH HIS APPEARANCE SEEMS TO HAVE IMPRESSED ITSELF UPON THE GUARD'S MEMORY FOR HE WAS PREPARED AFTERWARDS
1006-135212-0012 TO DESCRIBE OR TO IDENTIFY HIM HE WAS A MAN OF THIRTY FOUR OR THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE DRESSED IN SOME GREY MATERIAL SHARP NOSED ALERT WITH A RUDDY WEATHER BEATEN FACE AND A SMALL
1006-135212-0013 HE GLANCED UP AS THE DOOR WAS OPENED THE TALL MAN PAUSED WITH HIS FOOT UPON THE STEP THIS IS A SMOKING COMPARTMENT THE LADY DISLIKES SMOKE
1006-135212-0014 ALL RIGHT HERE YOU ARE SIR SAID JOHN PALMER HE SLAMMED THE DOOR OF THE SMOKING CARRIAGE OPENED THAT OF THE NEXT ONE WHICH WAS EMPTY AND THRUST THE TWO TRAVELLERS IN AT THE SAME MOMENT HE SOUNDED HIS WHISTLE
1006-135212-0015 AND THE WHEELS OF THE TRAIN BEGAN TO MOVE THE MAN WITH THE CIGAR WAS AT THE WINDOW OF HIS CARRIAGE AND SAID SOMETHING TO THE GUARD AS HE ROLLED PAST HIM BUT THE WORDS WERE LOST IN THE BUSTLE OF THE DEPARTURE PALMER STEPPED INTO THE GUARD'S VAN
1006-135212-0016 AS IT CAME UP TO HIM AND THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE INCIDENT TWELVE MINUTES AFTER ITS DEPARTURE THE TRAIN REACHED WILLESDEN JUNCTION WHERE IT STOPPED FOR A VERY SHORT INTERVAL AN EXAMINATION OF THE TICKETS HAS MADE IT CERTAIN
1006-135212-0017 THAT NO ONE EITHER JOINED OR LEFT IT AT THIS TIME AND NO PASSENGER WAS SEEN TO ALIGHT UPON THE PLATFORM AT FIVE FOURTEEN THE JOURNEY TO MANCHESTER WAS RESUMED AND RUGBY WAS REACHED AT SIX FIFTY
1006-135212-0018 THE EXPRESS BEING FIVE MINUTES LATE AT RUGBY THE ATTENTION OF THE STATION OFFICIALS WAS DRAWN TO THE FACT THAT THE DOOR OF ONE OF THE FIRST CLASS CARRIAGES WAS OPEN AN EXAMINATION OF THAT COMPARTMENT AND OF ITS NEIGHBOUR
1006-135212-0019 DISCLOSED A REMARKABLE STATE OF AFFAIRS THE SMOKING CARRIAGE IN WHICH THE SHORT RED FACED MAN
1006-135212-0020 SAVE FOR A HALF SMOKED CIGAR THERE WAS NO TRACE WHATEVER OF ITS RECENT OCCUPANT THE DOOR OF THIS CARRIAGE WAS FASTENED IN THE NEXT COMPARTMENT TO WHICH ATTENTION HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY DRAWN
1006-135212-0021 THERE WAS NO SIGN EITHER OF THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE ASTRAKHAN COLLAR OR OF THE YOUNG LADY WHO ACCOMPANIED HIM ALL THREE PASSENGERS HAD DISAPPEARED ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WAS FOUND UPON THE FLOOR OF THIS CARRIAGE
1006-135212-0022 THE ONE IN WHICH THE TALL TRAVELLER AND THE LADY HAD BEEN A YOUNG MAN FASHIONABLY DRESSED AND OF ELEGANT APPEARANCE HE LAY WITH HIS KNEES
1006-135212-0023 AN ELBOW UPON EITHER SEAT A BULLET HAD PENETRATED HIS HEART AND HIS DEATH MUST HAVE BEEN INSTANTANEOUS NO ONE HAD SEEN SUCH A MAN ENTER THE TRAIN AND NO RAILWAY TICKET WAS FOUND IN HIS POCKET
1006-135212-0024 AS WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO THE THREE PEOPLE WHO HAD STARTED AN HOUR AND A HALF BEFORE FROM WILLESDEN IN THOSE TWO COMPARTMENTS I HAVE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO PERSONAL PROPERTY WHICH MIGHT HELP TO IDENTIFY HIM
1006-135212-0025 BUT IT IS TRUE THAT THERE WAS ONE PECULIARITY ABOUT THIS UNKNOWN YOUNG MAN WHICH WAS MUCH COMMENTED UPON AT THE TIME IN HIS POCKETS WERE FOUND NO FEWER THAN SIX VALUABLE GOLD WATCHES
1006-135212-0026 THREE IN THE VARIOUS POCKETS OF HIS WAIST COAT ONE IN HIS TICKET POCKET
1006-135212-0027 AND THAT THIS WAS HIS PLUNDER WAS DISCOUNTED BY THE FACT THAT ALL SIX WERE OF AMERICAN MAKE AND OF A TYPE WHICH IS RARE IN ENGLAND THREE OF THEM BORE THE MARK OF THE ROCHESTER WATCHMAKING COMPANY
1006-135212-0028 AND THE SMALL ONE WHICH WAS HIGHLY JEWELLED AND ORNAMENTED WAS FROM TIFFANY OF NEW YORK THE OTHER CONTENTS OF HIS POCKET CONSISTED OF AN IVORY KNIFE WITH A CORKSCREW BY RODGERS OF SHEFFIELD A SMALL CIRCULAR MIRROR
1006-135212-0029 ONE INCH IN DIAMETER A READMISSION SLIP TO THE LYCEUM THEATRE A SILVER BOX FULL OF VESTA MATCHES AND A BROWN LEATHER CIGAR CASE CONTAINING TWO CHEROOTS
1006-135212-0030 ALSO TWO POUNDS FOURTEEN SHILLINGS IN MONEY IT WAS CLEAR THEN THAT WHATEVER MOTIVES MAY HAVE LED TO HIS DEATH ROBBERY WAS NOT AMONG THEM AS ALREADY MENTIONED THERE WERE NO MARKINGS UPON THE MAN'S LINEN
1006-135212-0031 WHICH APPEARED TO BE NEW AND NO TAILOR'S NAME UPON HIS COAT IN APPEARANCE HE WAS YOUNG SHORT SMOOTH CHEEKED AND DELICATELY FEATURED ONE OF HIS FRONT TEETH
1006-135212-0032 THE TWO COMPARTMENTS IN QUESTION WAS UNCOUPLED AND SIDE TRACKED THEN ON THE ARRIVAL OF INSPECTOR VANE OF SCOTLAND YARD AND OF MISTER HENDERSON A DETECTIVE IN THE SERVICE OF THE RAILWAY COMPANY AN EXHAUSTIVE INQUIRY
1006-135212-0033 WAS MADE INTO ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT CRIME HAD BEEN COMMITTED WAS CERTAIN THE BULLET WHICH APPEARED TO HAVE COME FROM A SMALL PISTOL OR REVOLVER HAD BEEN FIRED FROM SOME LITTLE DISTANCE
1006-135212-0034 AS THERE WAS NO SCORCHING OF THE CLOTHES NO WEAPON WAS FOUND IN THE COMPARTMENT WHICH FINALLY DISPOSED OF THE THEORY OF SUICIDE NOR WAS THERE ANY SIGN OF THE BROWN LEATHER BAG WHICH THE GUARD HAD SEEN IN THE HAND OF THE TALL GENTLEMAN
1006-135212-0035 COULD GET OUT OF THE TRAIN AND ONE OTHER GET IN DURING THE UNBROKEN RUN BETWEEN WILLESDEN AND RUGBY
1006-135212-0036 JOHN PALMER THE GUARD WAS ABLE AT THE INQUEST TO GIVE SOME EVIDENCE WHICH THREW A LITTLE LIGHT UPON THE MATTER THERE WAS A SPOT BETWEEN TRING AND CHEDDINGTON ACCORDING TO HIS STATEMENT WHERE ON ACCOUNT OF SOME REPAIRS TO THE LINE
1006-135212-0037 THE TRAIN HAD FOR A FEW MINUTES SLOWED DOWN TO A PACE NOT EXCEEDING EIGHT OR TEN MILES AN HOUR AT THAT PLACE IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE FOR A MAN OR EVEN FOR AN EXCEPTIONALLY ACTIVE WOMAN TO HAVE LEFT THE TRAIN WITHOUT SERIOUS INJURY
1006-135212-0038 IT WAS TRUE THAT A GANG OF PLATELAYERS WAS THERE AND THAT THEY HAD SEEN NOTHING BUT IT WAS THEIR CUSTOM TO STAND IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN THE METALS AND THE OPEN CARRIAGE DOOR WAS UPON THE FAR SIDE
1006-135212-0039 SO THAT IT WAS CONCEIVABLE THAT SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE ALIGHTED UNSEEN AS THE DARKNESS WOULD BY THAT TIME BE DRAWING IN A STEEP EMBANKMENT WOULD INSTANTLY SCREEN ANYONE WHO SPRANG OUT FROM THE OBSERVATION OF THE NAVVIES
1006-135212-0040 A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE LINE BETWEEN WILLESDEN AND RUGBY RESULTED IN ONE DISCOVERY WHICH MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT HAVE A BEARING UPON THE TRAGEDY NEAR TRING AT THE VERY PLACE WHERE THE TRAIN SLOWED DOWN
1006-135212-0041 THERE WAS FOUND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE EMBANKMENT A SMALL POCKET TESTAMENT VERY SHABBY AND WORN IT WAS PRINTED BY THE BIBLE SOCIETY OF LONDON AND BORE AN INSCRIPTION FROM JOHN TO ALICE
1006-135212-0042 UPON THE FLY LEAF UNDERNEATH WAS WRITTEN JAMES
1006-135212-0043 EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE AND BENEATH THAT AGAIN EDWARD NOVEMBER FIRST EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE ALL THE ENTRIES BEING IN THE SAME HANDWRITING THIS WAS THE ONLY CLUE IF IT COULD BE CALLED A CLUE
1006-135212-0044 WHICH WAS SOLID ENOUGH TO FORM THE BASIS FOR A PROFITABLE INVESTIGATION IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE HOWEVER
1006-135212-0045 ON THE CONTRARY THE PRESS BOTH IN ENGLAND AND IN AMERICA TEEMED WITH SUGGESTIONS AND SUPPOSITIONS MOST OF WHICH WERE OBVIOUSLY ABSURD THE FACT THAT THE WATCHES WERE OF AMERICAN MAKE
1006-135212-0046 AND SOME PECULIARITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE GOLD STOPPING OF HIS FRONT TOOTH APPEARED TO INDICATE THAT THE DECEASED WAS A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES THOUGH HIS LINEN CLOTHES AND BOOTS WERE UNDOUBTEDLY OF BRITISH MANUFACTURE
1006-135212-0047 IT WAS SURMISED BY SOME THAT HE WAS CONCEALED UNDER THE SEAT AND THAT BEING DISCOVERED HE WAS FOR SOME REASON POSSIBLY BECAUSE HE HAD OVERHEARD THEIR GUILTY SECRETS PUT TO DEATH BY HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS
1006-135212-0048 WHEN COUPLED WITH GENERALITIES AS TO THE FEROCITY AND CUNNING OF ANARCHICAL AND OTHER SECRET SOCIETIES THIS THEORY SOUNDED AS PLAUSIBLE AS ANY THE FACT THAT HE SHOULD BE WITHOUT A TICKET WOULD BE CONSISTENT
1006-135212-0049 WITH THE IDEA OF CONCEALMENT AND IT WAS WELL KNOWN THAT WOMEN PLAYED A PROMINENT PART IN THE NIHILISTIC PROPAGANDA ON THE OTHER HAND IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE GUARD'S STATEMENT THAT THE MAN MUST HAVE BEEN HIDDEN THERE BEFORE
1006-135212-0050 THE OTHERS ARRIVED AND HOW UNLIKELY THE COINCIDENCE THAT CONSPIRATORS SHOULD STRAY EXACTLY INTO THE VERY COMPARTMENT IN WHICH A SPY WAS ALREADY CONCEALED BESIDES THIS EXPLANATION IGNORED THE MAN IN THE SMOKING CARRIAGE
1006-135212-0051 THE POLICE HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN SHOWING THAT SUCH A THEORY WOULD NOT COVER THE FACTS BUT THEY WERE UNPREPARED IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE TO ADVANCE ANY ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION THERE WAS A LETTER IN THE DAILY GAZETTE
1006-135212-0052 OVER THE SIGNATURE OF A WELL KNOWN CRIMINAL INVESTIGATOR WHICH GAVE RISE TO CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION AT THE TIME HE HAD FORMED A HYPOTHESIS WHICH HAD AT LEAST INGENUITY TO RECOMMEND IT
1006-135212-0053 AND I CANNOT DO BETTER THAN APPEND IT IN HIS OWN WORDS WHATEVER MAY BE THE TRUTH SAID HE IT MUST DEPEND UPON SOME BIZARRE AND RARE COMBINATION OF EVENTS
1006-135212-0054 SO WE NEED HAVE NO HESITATION IN POSTULATING SUCH EVENTS IN OUR EXPLANATION IN THE ABSENCE OF DATA WE MUST ABANDON THE ANALYTIC OR SCIENTIFIC METHOD OF INVESTIGATION AND MUST APPROACH IT
1006-135212-0055 IN THE SYNTHETIC FASHION IN A WORD INSTEAD OF TAKING KNOWN EVENTS AND DEDUCING FROM THEM WHAT HAS OCCURRED WE MUST BUILD UP A FANCIFUL EXPLANATION IF IT WILL ONLY BE CONSISTENT WITH KNOWN EVENTS
1006-135212-0056 WE CAN THEN TEST THIS EXPLANATION BY ANY FRESH FACTS WHICH MAY ARISE IF THEY ALL FIT INTO THEIR PLACES THE PROBABILITY IS THAT WE ARE UPON THE RIGHT TRACK
1006-135212-0057 NOW THERE IS ONE MOST REMARKABLE AND SUGGESTIVE FACT WHICH HAS NOT MET WITH THE ATTENTION WHICH IT DESERVES THERE IS A LOCAL TRAIN RUNNING THROUGH HARROW AND KING'S LANGLEY WHICH IS TIMED IN SUCH A WAY
1006-135212-0058 THAT THE EXPRESS MUST HAVE OVERTAKEN IT AT OR ABOUT THE PERIOD WHEN IT EASED DOWN ITS SPEED TO EIGHT MILES AN HOUR ON ACCOUNT OF THE REPAIRS OF THE LINE THE TWO TRAINS WOULD AT THAT TIME BE TRAVELLING IN THE SAME DIRECTION
1006-135212-0059 AT A SIMILAR RATE OF SPEED AND UPON PARALLEL LINES
1006-135212-0060 THIS YOUNG MAN WITH THE ABNORMAL NUMBER OF WATCHES WAS ALONE IN THE CARRIAGE OF THE SLOW TRAIN HIS TICKET WITH HIS PAPERS AND GLOVES AND OTHER THINGS WAS WE WILL SUPPOSE ON THE SEAT BESIDE HIM
1006-135212-0061 HE WAS PROBABLY AN AMERICAN AND ALSO PROBABLY A MAN OF WEAK INTELLECT THE EXCESSIVE WEARING OF JEWELLERY IS AN EARLY SYMPTOM IN SOME FORMS OF MANIA AS HE SAT WATCHING THE CARRIAGES OF THE EXPRESS WHICH WERE
1006-135212-0062 ON ACCOUNT OF THE STATE OF THE LINE GOING AT THE SAME PACE AS HIMSELF
1006-135212-0063 THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE A WOMAN WHOM HE LOVED AND A MAN WHOM HE HATED AND WHO IN RETURN HATED HIM THE YOUNG MAN WAS EXCITABLE AND IMPULSIVE HE OPENED THE DOOR OF HIS CARRIAGE STEPPED FROM THE FOOTBOARD
1006-135212-0064 OF THE LOCAL TRAIN TO THE FOOTBOARD OF THE EXPRESS OPENED THE OTHER DOOR AND MADE HIS WAY INTO THE PRESENCE OF THESE TWO PEOPLE THE FEAT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE TRAINS WERE GOING AT THE SAME PACE IS BY NO MEANS SO PERILOUS
1006-135212-0065 THAT THE PAIR WERE ALSO AMERICANS
1006-135212-0066 IF OUR SUPPOSITION OF INCIPIENT MANIA IS CORRECT THE YOUNG MAN IS LIKELY TO HAVE ASSAULTED THE OTHER AS THE UPSHOT OF THE QUARREL THE ELDER MAN SHOT THE INTRUDER AND THEN MADE HIS ESCAPE FROM THE CARRIAGE
1006-135212-0067 AND THAT THE TRAIN WAS STILL GOING AT SO SLOW A PACE THAT IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO LEAVE IT A WOMAN MIGHT LEAVE A TRAIN GOING AT EIGHT MILES AN HOUR
1006-135212-0068 THAT THIS WOMAN DID DO SO AND NOW WE HAVE TO FIT IN THE MAN IN THE SMOKING CARRIAGE PRESUMING THAT WE HAVE UP TO THIS POINT RECONSTRUCTED THE TRAGEDY CORRECTLY
1006-135212-0069 TO CAUSE US TO RECONSIDER OUR CONCLUSIONS
1006-135212-0070 SAW HIM OPEN THE DOOR HEARD THE PISTOL SHOT
1006-135212-0071 REALIZED THAT MURDER HAD BEEN DONE AND SPRANG OUT HIMSELF IN PURSUIT WHY HE HAS NEVER BEEN HEARD OF SINCE WHETHER HE MET HIS OWN DEATH IN THE PURSUIT OR WHETHER AS IS MORE LIKELY HE WAS MADE TO REALIZE THAT IT WAS NOT A CASE FOR HIS INTERFERENCE
1006-135212-0072 IS A DETAIL WHICH WE HAVE AT PRESENT NO MEANS OF EXPLAINING I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE SOME DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY AT FIRST SIGHT IT MIGHT SEEM IMPROBABLE THAT AT SUCH A MOMENT A MURDERER WOULD BURDEN HIMSELF IN HIS FLIGHT WITH A BROWN LEATHER BAG
1006-135212-0073 MY ANSWER IS THAT HE WAS WELL AWARE THAT IF THE BAG WERE FOUND HIS IDENTITY WOULD BE ESTABLISHED IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR HIM TO TAKE IT WITH HIM MY THEORY STANDS OR FALLS UPON ONE POINT
1006-135212-0074 AND I CALL UPON THE RAILWAY COMPANY TO MAKE STRICT INQUIRY
1006-135212-0075 AND KING'S LANGLEY UPON THE EIGHTEENTH OF MARCH IF SUCH A TICKET WERE FOUND MY CASE IS PROVED IF NOT MY THEORY MAY STILL BE THE CORRECT ONE FOR IT IS CONCEIVABLE EITHER THAT HE TRAVELLED WITHOUT A TICKET OR THAT HIS TICKET WAS LOST
1006-135212-0076 AND THIRDLY THAT THE LOCAL TRAIN HAD BEEN STATIONARY IN KING'S LANGLEY STATION WHEN THE EXPRESS GOING AT FIFTY MILES AN HOUR HAD FLASHED PAST IT SO PERISHED THE ONLY SATISFYING EXPLANATION AND FIVE YEARS HAVE ELAPSED WITHOUT SUPPLYING A NEW ONE
1006-135212-0077 YOU'LL EXCUSE ME IF I'M NOT VERY FREE WITH NAMES THERE'S LESS REASON NOW THAN THERE WAS FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN MOTHER WAS STILL LIVING BUT FOR ALL THAT I HAD RATHER COVER UP OUR TRACKS ALL I CAN
1006-135212-0078 BUT I OWE YOU AN EXPLANATION FOR IF YOUR IDEA OF IT WAS WRONG IT WAS A MIGHTY INGENIOUS ONE ALL THE SAME I'LL HAVE TO GO BACK A LITTLE SO AS YOU MAY UNDERSTAND ALL ABOUT IT
1006-135212-0079 MY PEOPLE CAME FROM BUCKS ENGLAND AND EMIGRATED TO THE STATES IN THE EARLY FIFTIES THEY SETTLED IN ROCHESTER IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK WHERE MY FATHER RAN A LARGE DRY GOODS STORE
1006-135212-0080 BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS A SOFT SPOT IN HIM AND IT WAS LIKE MOULD IN CHEESE FOR IT SPREAD AND SPREAD AND NOTHING THAT YOU COULD DO WOULD STOP IT MOTHER SAW IT JUST AS CLEARLY AS I DID BUT SHE WENT ON SPOILING HIM ALL THE SAME
1006-135212-0081 FOR HE HAD SUCH A WAY WITH HIM THAT YOU COULD REFUSE HIM NOTHING I DID ALL I COULD TO HOLD HIM IN AND HE HATED ME FOR MY PAINS AT LAST HE FAIRLY GOT HIS HEAD AND NOTHING THAT WE COULD DO WOULD STOP HIM
1006-135212-0082 HE GOT OFF INTO NEW YORK AND WENT RAPIDLY FROM BAD TO WORSE AT FIRST HE WAS ONLY FAST AND THEN HE WAS CRIMINAL AND THEN AT THE END OF A YEAR OR TWO HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS YOUNG CROOKS IN THE CITY
1006-135212-0083 HE HAD FORMED A FRIENDSHIP WITH SPARROW MAC COY WHO WAS AT THE HEAD OF HIS PROFESSION AS A BUNCO STEERER GREEN GOODSMAN AND GENERAL RASCAL THEY TOOK TO CARD SHARPING
1006-135212-0084 AND THEN ONE DAY HE DRESSED HIMSELF AS A GIRL AND HE CARRIED IT OFF SO WELL AND MADE HIMSELF SUCH A VALUABLE DECOY THAT IT WAS THEIR FAVOURITE GAME AFTERWARDS THEY HAD MADE IT RIGHT WITH TAMMANY AND WITH THE POLICE
1006-135212-0085 SO IT SEEMED AS IF NOTHING COULD EVER STOP THEM
1006-135212-0086 AND IF YOU ONLY HAD A PULL YOU COULD DO PRETTY NEARLY EVERYTHING YOU WANTED AND NOTHING WOULD HAVE STOPPED THEM IF THEY HAD ONLY STUCK TO CARDS AND NEW YORK BUT THEY MUST NEEDS COME UP ROCHESTER WAY AND FORGE A NAME UPON A CHEQUE
1006-135212-0087 IT WAS MY BROTHER THAT DID IT THOUGH EVERYONE KNEW THAT IT WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SPARROW MAC COY I BOUGHT UP THAT CHEQUE AND A PRETTY SUM IT COST ME
1006-135212-0088 AND SWORE TO HIM THAT I WOULD PROSECUTE IF HE DID NOT CLEAR OUT OF THE COUNTRY AT FIRST HE SIMPLY LAUGHED I COULD NOT PROSECUTE HE SAID WITHOUT BREAKING OUR MOTHER'S HEART AND HE KNEW THAT I WOULD NOT DO THAT
1006-135212-0089 I MADE HIM UNDERSTAND HOWEVER THAT OUR MOTHER'S HEART WAS BEING BROKEN IN ANY CASE AND THAT I HAD SET FIRM ON THE POINT THAT I WOULD RATHER SEE HIM IN ROCHESTER GAOL THAN IN
1006-135212-0090 SO AT LAST HE GAVE IN AND HE MADE ME A SOLEMN PROMISE THAT HE WOULD SEE SPARROW MAC COY NO MORE THAT HE WOULD GO TO EUROPE AND THAT HE WOULD TURN HIS HAND TO ANY HONEST TRADE THAT I HELPED HIM TO GET
1006-135212-0091 I TOOK HIM DOWN RIGHT AWAY TO AN OLD FAMILY FRIEND JOE WILLSON WHO IS AN EXPORTER OF AMERICAN WATCHES AND CLOCKS AND I GOT HIM TO GIVE EDWARD AN AGENCY IN LONDON
1006-135212-0092 WITH A SMALL SALARY AND A FIFTEEN PER CENT COMMISSION ON ALL BUSINESS HIS MANNER AND APPEARANCE WERE SO GOOD THAT HE WON THE OLD MAN OVER AT ONCE AND WITHIN A WEEK HE WAS SENT OFF TO LONDON WITH A CASE FULL OF SAMPLES
1006-135212-0093 AND WHAT SHE SAID HAD TOUCHED HIM FOR SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN THE BEST OF MOTHERS TO HIM AND HE HAD BEEN THE GREAT SORROW OF HER LIFE BUT I KNEW THAT THIS MAN SPARROW MAC COY HAD A GREAT INFLUENCE OVER EDWARD AND MY CHANCE OF KEEPING THE LAD
1006-135212-0094 STRAIGHT LAY IN BREAKING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM I HAD A FRIEND IN THE NEW YORK DETECTIVE FORCE
1006-135212-0095 WHEN WITHIN A FORTNIGHT OF MY BROTHER'S SAILING I HEARD THAT MAC COY HAD TAKEN A BERTH IN THE ETRURIA I WAS AS CERTAIN AS IF HE HAD TOLD ME THAT HE WAS GOING OVER TO ENGLAND
1006-135212-0096 THAT IT WAS MY DUTY WE PASSED THE LAST NIGHT TOGETHER IN PRAYER FOR MY SUCCESS AND SHE GAVE ME HER OWN TESTAMENT THAT MY FATHER HAD GIVEN HER ON THE DAY OF THEIR MARRIAGE IN THE OLD COUNTRY
1006-135212-0097 SO THAT I MIGHT ALWAYS WEAR IT NEXT MY HEART I WAS A FELLOW TRAVELLER ON THE STEAMSHIP WITH SPARROW MAC COY AND AT LEAST I HAD THE SATISFACTION OF SPOILING HIS LITTLE GAME FOR THE VOYAGE THE VERY FIRST NIGHT
1006-135212-0098 I WENT INTO THE SMOKING ROOM AND FOUND HIM AT THE HEAD OF A CARD TABLE WITH A HALF A DOZEN YOUNG FELLOWS WHO WERE CARRYING THEIR FULL PURSES AND THEIR EMPTY SKULLS OVER TO EUROPE
1006-135212-0099 HE WAS SETTLING DOWN FOR HIS HARVEST AND A RICH ONE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BUT I SOON CHANGED ALL THAT GENTLEMEN SAID I ARE YOU AWARE WHOM YOU ARE PLAYING WITH WHAT'S THAT TO YOU YOU MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS
1006-135212-0100 SAID HE WITH AN OATH WHO IS IT ANYWAY ASKED ONE OF THE DUDES HE'S SPARROW MAC COY THE MOST NOTORIOUS CARD SHARPER IN THE STATES UP HE JUMPED WITH A BOTTLE IN HIS HAND
1006-135212-0101 SAID HE I WILL SAID I IF YOU WILL TURN UP YOUR RIGHT SHIRT SLEEVE TO THE SHOULDER I WILL EITHER PROVE MY WORDS OR I WILL EAT THEM HE TURNED WHITE AND SAID NOT A WORD YOU SEE
1006-135212-0102 I KNEW SOMETHING OF HIS WAYS AND I WAS AWARE OF THAT PART OF THE MECHANISM WHICH HE AND ALL SUCH SHARPERS USE CONSISTS OF AN ELASTIC DOWN THE ARM WITH A CLIP JUST ABOVE THE WRIST IT IS BY MEANS OF THIS CLIP
1006-135212-0103 THAT THEY WITHDRAW FROM THEIR HANDS THE CARDS WHICH THEY DO NOT WANT WHILE THEY SUBSTITUTE OTHER CARDS FROM ANOTHER HIDING PLACE I RECKONED ON IT BEING THERE AND IT WAS HE CURSED ME
1006-135212-0104 HE OUTWEIGHED ME EVERY TIME EDWARD HAD KEPT HIMSELF STRAIGHT IN LONDON FOR THE FIRST FEW WEEKS AND HAD DONE SOME BUSINESS WITH HIS AMERICAN WATCHES UNTIL THIS VILLAIN CAME ACROSS HIS PATH ONCE MORE I DID MY BEST
1006-135212-0105 BUT THE BEST WAS LITTLE ENOUGH THE NEXT THING I HEARD THERE HAD BEEN A SCANDAL AT ONE OF THE NORTHUMBERLAND AVENUE HOTELS A TRAVELLER HAD BEEN FLEECED OF A LARGE SUM BY TWO CONFEDERATE CARD SHARPERS
1006-135212-0106 AND THE MATTER WAS IN THE HANDS OF SCOTLAND YARD THE FIRST I LEARNED OF IT WAS IN THE EVENING PAPER AND I WAS AT ONCE CERTAIN THAT MY BROTHER AND MAC COY WERE BACK AT THEIR OLD GAMES I HURRIED AT ONCE TO EDWARD'S LODGINGS
1006-135212-0107 ENDING WITH EUSTON STATION AND SHE HAD ACCIDENTALLY OVERHEARD THE TALL GENTLEMAN SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT MANCHESTER SHE BELIEVED THAT THAT WAS THEIR DESTINATION A GLANCE AT THE TIME TABLE SHOWED ME THAT THE MOST LIKELY TRAIN WAS AT FIVE
1006-135212-0108 THOUGH THERE WAS ANOTHER AT FOUR THIRTY FIVE WHICH THEY MIGHT HAVE CAUGHT I HAD ONLY TIME TO GET THE LATER ONE BUT FOUND NO SIGN OF THEM EITHER AT THE DEPOT OR IN THE TRAIN
1006-135212-0109 ONE LAST APPEAL TO MY BROTHER BY ALL THAT HE OWED TO MY MOTHER MIGHT EVEN NOW BE THE SALVATION OF HIM MY NERVES WERE OVERSTRUNG AND I LIT A CIGAR TO STEADY THEM AT THAT MOMENT JUST AS THE TRAIN WAS MOVING OFF
1006-135212-0110 THE DOOR OF MY COMPARTMENT WAS FLUNG OPEN AND THERE WERE MAC COY AND MY BROTHER ON THE PLATFORM THEY WERE BOTH DISGUISED AND WITH GOOD REASON FOR THEY KNEW THAT THE LONDON POLICE WERE AFTER THEM MAC COY HAD A GREAT ASTRAKHAN COLLAR
1006-135212-0111 DRAWN UP SO THAT ONLY HIS EYES AND NOSE WERE SHOWING MY BROTHER WAS DRESSED LIKE A WOMAN WITH A BLACK VEIL HALF DOWN HIS FACE BUT OF COURSE IT DID NOT DECEIVE ME FOR AN INSTANT NOR WOULD IT HAVE DONE
1006-135212-0112 SO EVEN IF I HAD NOT KNOWN THAT HE HAD OFTEN USED SUCH A DRESS BEFORE I STARTED UP AND AS I DID SO MAC COY RECOGNIZED ME HE SAID SOMETHING THE CONDUCTOR SLAMMED THE DOOR AND THEY WERE SHOWN INTO THE NEXT COMPARTMENT
1006-135212-0113 I TRIED TO STOP THE TRAIN SO AS TO FOLLOW THEM BUT THE WHEELS WERE ALREADY MOVING AND IT WAS TOO LATE WHEN WE STOPPED AT WILLESDEN I INSTANTLY CHANGED MY CARRIAGE IT APPEARS THAT I WAS NOT SEEN TO DO SO WHICH IS NOT SURPRISING
1006-135212-0114 I HAD NEVER FOUND HIM SO IMPOSSIBLE TO SOFTEN OR TO MOVE I TRIED THIS WAY AND I TRIED THAT I PICTURED HIS FUTURE IN AN ENGLISH G A O L I DESCRIBED THE SORROW OF HIS MOTHER WHEN I CAME BACK WITH THE NEWS I SAID EVERYTHING TO TOUCH HIS HEART
1006-135212-0115 BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE HE SAT THERE WITH A FIXED SNEER UPON HIS HANDSOME FACE WHILE EVERY NOW AND THEN SPARROW MAC COY
1006-135212-0116 OR SOME WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT TO HOLD MY BROTHER TO HIS RESOLUTIONS WHY DON'T YOU RUN A SUNDAY SCHOOL HE WOULD SAY TO ME AND THEN IN THE SAME BREATH HE THINKS YOU HAVE NO WILL OF YOUR OWN
1006-135212-0117 HE THINKS YOU ARE JUST THE BABY BROTHER AND THAT HE CAN LEAD YOU WHERE HE LIKES HE'S ONLY JUST FINDING OUT THAT YOU ARE A MAN AS WELL AS HE IT WAS THOSE WORDS OF HIS WHICH SET ME TALKING BITTERLY WE HAD LEFT WILLESDEN
1006-135212-0118 YOU UNDERSTAND FOR ALL THIS TOOK SOME TIME MY TEMPER GOT THE BETTER OF ME AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I LET MY BROTHER SEE THE ROUGH SIDE OF ME PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER HAD I DONE SO EARLIER AND MORE OFTEN A MAN
1006-135212-0119 I DON'T SUPPOSE IN ALL THIS COUNTRY THERE IS A MORE CONTEMPTIBLE LOOKING CREATURE THAN YOU ARE AS YOU SIT THERE WITH THAT DOLLY PINAFORE UPON YOU HE COLOURED UP AT THAT FOR HE WAS A VAIN MAN AND HE WINCED FROM RIDICULE
1006-135212-0120 ONE'S SCENT AND I HAD NO OTHER WAY TO DO IT HE TOOK HIS TOQUE OFF WITH THE VEIL ATTACHED
1006-135212-0121 YOU'LL NEVER MAKE A MARY JANE OF YOURSELF WHILE I CAN HELP IT IF NOTHING BUT THAT DISGUISE STANDS BETWEEN YOU AND A GAOL THEN TO GAOL YOU SHALL GO THAT WAS THE WAY TO MANAGE HIM I FELT MY ADVANTAGE AT ONCE
1006-135212-0122 HIS SUPPLE NATURE WAS ONE WHICH YIELDED TO ROUGHNESS FAR MORE READILY THAN TO
1006-135212-0123 HE'S MY BROTHER AND YOU SHALL NOT RUIN HIM SAID I I BELIEVE A SPELL OF PRISON IS THE VERY BEST WAY OF KEEPING YOU APART AND YOU SHALL HAVE IT OR IT WILL BE NO FAULT OF MINE
1006-135212-0124 I SPRANG FOR HIS HAND BUT SAW THAT I WAS TOO LATE AND JUMPED ASIDE AT THE SAME INSTANT HE FIRED AND THE BULLET WHICH WOULD HAVE STRUCK ME PASSED THROUGH THE HEART OF MY UNFORTUNATE BROTHER
1006-135212-0125 BUT HIS ANGER AGAINST ME AND MY RESENTMENT TOWARDS HIM HAD BOTH FOR THE MOMENT BEEN SWALLOWED UP IN THIS SUDDEN TRAGEDY IT WAS HE WHO FIRST REALIZED THE SITUATION THE TRAIN WAS FOR SOME REASON GOING VERY SLOWLY AT THE MOMENT
1006-135212-0126 AND HE SAW HIS OPPORTUNITY FOR ESCAPE IN AN INSTANT HE HAD THE DOOR OPEN BUT I WAS AS QUICK AS HE AND JUMPING UPON HIM THE TWO OF US FELL OFF THE
1006-135212-0127 AND SOMEBODY WAS BATHING MY HEAD WITH A WET HANDKERCHIEF IT WAS SPARROW MAC COY I GUESS I COULDN'T LEAVE YOU SAID HE I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE THE BLOOD OF TWO OF YOU ON MY HANDS IN ONE DAY YOU LOVED YOUR BROTHER I'VE NO DOUBT
1006-135212-0128 BUT YOU DIDN'T LOVE HIM A CENT MORE THAN I LOVED HIM THOUGH YOU'LL SAY THAT I TOOK A QUEER WAY TO SHOW IT ANYHOW IT SEEMS A MIGHTY EMPTY WORLD NOW THAT HE IS GONE AND I DON'T CARE A CONTINENTAL WHETHER YOU GIVE ME OVER TO THE HANGMAN OR NOT
1006-135212-0129 AND TO TURN INTO SOMETHING LIKE SYMPATHY WHAT WAS THE USE OF REVENGING HIS DEATH UPON A MAN WHO WAS AS MUCH STRICKEN BY THAT DEATH AS I WAS AND THEN AS MY WITS GRADUALLY RETURNED I BEGAN TO REALIZE
1006-135212-0130 ALSO THAT I COULD DO NOTHING AGAINST MAC COY WHICH WOULD NOT RECOIL UPON MY MOTHER AND MYSELF HOW COULD WE CONVICT HIM WITHOUT A FULL ACCOUNT OF MY BROTHER'S CAREER BEING MADE PUBLIC THE VERY THING WHICH OF ALL OTHERS WE WISHED TO AVOID
1006-135212-0131 AND AS WE GROPED OUR WAY THROUGH IT I FOUND MYSELF CONSULTING THE SLAYER OF MY BROTHER AS TO HOW FAR IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO HUSH IT UP I SOON REALIZED FROM WHAT HE SAID
1006-135212-0132 THAT UNLESS THERE WERE SOME PAPERS OF WHICH WE KNEW NOTHING IN MY BROTHER'S POCKETS THERE WAS REALLY NO POSSIBLE MEANS BY WHICH THE POLICE COULD IDENTIFY HIM OR LEARN HOW HE HAD GOT THERE HIS TICKET WAS IN MAC COY'S POCKET
1006-135212-0133 AND SO WAS THE TICKET FOR SOME BAGGAGE WHICH THEY HAD LEFT AT THE DEPOT LIKE MOST AMERICANS HE HAD FOUND IT CHEAPER AND EASIER TO BUY AN OUTFIT IN LONDON THAN TO BRING ONE FROM NEW YORK SO THAT ALL HIS LINEN AND CLOTHES WERE NEW AND UNMARKED
1006-135212-0134 THE BAG CONTAINING THE DUST CLOAK WHICH I HAD THROWN OUT OF THE WINDOW MAY HAVE FALLEN AMONG SOME BRAMBLE PATCH WHERE IT IS STILL CONCEALED OR MAY HAVE BEEN CARRIED OFF BY SOME TRAMP OR MAY HAVE COME INTO THE POSSESSION OF THE POLICE WHO KEPT
1006-135212-0135 THE INCIDENT TO THEMSELVES ANYHOW I HAVE SEEN NOTHING ABOUT IT IN THE LONDON PAPERS AS TO THE WATCHES THEY WERE A SELECTION FROM THOSE WHICH HAD BEEN INTRUSTED TO HIM FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES
1006-135212-0136 IT MAY HAVE BEEN FOR THE SAME BUSINESS PURPOSES THAT HE WAS TAKING THEM TO MANCHESTER BUT WELL IT'S TOO LATE TO ENTER INTO THAT I DON'T BLAME THE POLICE FOR BEING AT FAULT
1006-135212-0137 I DON'T SEE HOW IT COULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE THERE WAS JUST ONE LITTLE CLUE
1006-135212-0138 WHICH WAS FOUND IN MY BROTHER'S POCKET
