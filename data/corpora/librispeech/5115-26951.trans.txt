5115-26951-0000 AT SIX O'CLOCK THAT EVENING MOST PEOPLE IN FLORENCE WERE GLAD THE ENTRANCE OF THE NEW CHARLEMAGNE WAS FAIRLY OVER DOUBTLESS WHEN THE ROLL OF DRUMS THE BLAST OF TRUMPETS AND THE TRAMP OF HORSES ALONG THE PISAN ROAD BEGAN TO MINGLE WITH THE PEALING OF THE EXCITED BELLS
5115-26951-0001 IT WAS A GRAND MOMENT FOR THOSE WHO WERE STATIONED ON TURRETED ROOFS AND COULD SEE THE LONG WINDING TERRIBLE POMP ON THE BACKGROUND OF THE GREEN HILLS AND VALLEY THERE WAS NO SUNSHINE TO LIGHT UP THE SPLENDOUR OF BANNERS AND SPEARS AND PLUMES AND SILKEN SURCOATS
5115-26951-0002 BUT THERE WAS NO THICK CLOUD OF DUST TO HIDE IT AND AS THE PICKED TROOPS ADVANCED INTO CLOSE VIEW THEY COULD BE SEEN ALL THE MORE DISTINCTLY FOR THE ABSENCE OF DANCING GLITTER TALL AND TOUGH SCOTCH ARCHERS SWISS HALBERDIERS FIERCE AND PONDEROUS NIMBLE GASCONS READY TO WHEEL AND CLIMB
5115-26951-0003 CAVALRY IN WHICH EACH MAN LOOKED LIKE A KNIGHT ERRANT WITH HIS INDOMITABLE SPEAR AND CHARGER IT WAS SATISFACTORY TO BE ASSURED THAT THEY WOULD INJURE NOBODY BUT THE ENEMIES OF GOD
5115-26951-0004 WITH THAT CONFIDENCE AT HEART IT WAS A LESS DUBIOUS PLEASURE TO LOOK AT THE ARRAY OF STRENGTH AND SPLENDOUR IN NOBLES AND KNIGHTS AND YOUTHFUL PAGES OF CHOICE LINEAGE AT THE BOSSED AND JEWELLED SWORD HILTS AT THE SATIN SCARFS EMBROIDERED WITH STRANGE SYMBOLICAL DEVICES OF PIOUS OR GALLANT MEANING
5115-26951-0005 AT THE GOLD CHAINS AND JEWELLED AIGRETTES AT THE GORGEOUS HORSE TRAPPINGS AND BROCADED MANTLES AND AT THE TRANSCENDENT CANOPY CARRIED BY SELECT YOUTHS ABOVE THE HEAD OF THE MOST CHRISTIAN KING TO SUM UP WITH AN OLD DIARIST WHOSE SPELLING AND DICTION HALTED A LITTLE BEHIND THE WONDERS OF THIS ROYAL VISIT
5115-26951-0006 FU GRAN MAGNIFICENZA BUT FOR THE SIGNORIA WHO HAD BEEN WAITING ON THEIR PLATFORM AGAINST THE GATES AND HAD TO MARCH OUT AT THE RIGHT MOMENT WITH THEIR ORATOR IN FRONT OF THEM TO MEET THE MIGHTY GUEST THE GRANDEUR OF THE SCENE HAD BEEN SOMEWHAT SCREENED BY UNPLEASANT SENSATIONS
5115-26951-0007 AND REDUCED THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SCHOLARLY CITY TO OFFER A MAKESHIFT WELCOME IN IMPROMPTU FRENCH BUT THAT SUDDEN CONFUSION HAD CREATED A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR TITO AS ONE OF THE SECRETARIES HE WAS AMONG THE OFFICIALS WHO WERE STATIONED BEHIND THE SIGNORIA
5115-26951-0008 AND WITH WHOM THESE HIGHEST DIGNITIES WERE PROMISCUOUSLY THROWN WHEN PRESSED UPON BY THE HORSES SOMEBODY STEP FORWARD AND SAY A FEW WORDS IN FRENCH SAID SODERINI BUT NO ONE OF HIGH IMPORTANCE CHOSE TO RISK A SECOND FAILURE YOU FRANCESCO GADDI YOU CAN SPEAK
5115-26951-0009 BUT GADDI DISTRUSTING HIS OWN PROMPTNESS HUNG BACK AND PUSHING TITO SAID YOU MELEMA
5115-26951-0010 THAT CAME AS NATURALLY TO HIM AS WALKING SAID THE FEW NEEDFUL WORDS IN THE NAME OF THE SIGNORIA THEN GAVE WAY GRACEFULLY AND LET THE KING PASS ON HIS PRESENCE OF MIND WHICH HAD FAILED HIM IN THE TERRIBLE CRISIS OF THE MORNING HAD BEEN A READY INSTRUMENT THIS TIME
5115-26951-0011 BUT WHEN HE WAS COMPLIMENTED ON HIS OPPORTUNE SERVICE HE LAUGHED IT OFF AS A THING OF NO MOMENT AND TO THOSE WHO HAD NOT WITNESSED IT LET GADDI HAVE THE CREDIT OF THE IMPROVISED WELCOME
5115-26951-0012 OTHER THINGS BESIDES THE ORATORICAL WELCOME HAD TURNED OUT RATHER WORSE THAN HAD BEEN EXPECTED
5115-26951-0013 WOULD NOT HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY CHOKED UP AND BEEN OBLIGED TO TAKE A MAKESHIFT COURSE THROUGH THE BACK STREETS SO AS TO MEET THE KING AT THE CATHEDRAL ONLY ALSO IF THE YOUNG MONARCH UNDER THE CANOPY SEATED ON HIS CHARGER WITH HIS LANCE UPON HIS THIGH
5115-26951-0014 HAD LOOKED MORE LIKE A CHARLEMAGNE AND LESS LIKE A HASTILY MODELLED GROTESQUE THE IMAGINATION OF HIS ADMIRERS WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH ASSISTED IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WISHED THAT THE SCOURGE OF ITALIAN WICKEDNESS AND CHAMPION OF THE HONOUR OF WOMEN HAD HAD A LESS MISERABLE LEG AND ONLY THE NORMAL SUM OF TOES
5115-26951-0015 THAT HIS MOUTH HAD BEEN OF A LESS REPTILIAN WIDTH OF SLIT HIS NOSE AND HEAD OF A LESS EXORBITANT OUTLINE BUT THE THIN LEG RESTED ON CLOTH OF GOLD AND PEARLS AND THE FACE WAS ONLY AN INTERRUPTION OF A FEW SQUARE INCHES IN THE MIDST OF BLACK VELVET AND GOLD
5115-26951-0016 AND THE BLAZE OF RUBIES AND THE BRILLIANT TINTS OF THE EMBROIDERED AND BEPEARLED CANOPY FU GRAN MAGNIFICENZA
5115-26951-0017 CANOPY WHICH THEY HAD TORN TO PIECES AS THEIR SPOIL ACCORDING TO IMMEMORIAL CUSTOM ROYAL LIPS HAD DULY KISSED THE ALTAR AND AFTER ALL MISCHANCES THE ROYAL PERSON AND RETINUE WERE LODGED IN THE PALACE OF THE VIA LARGA
5115-26951-0018 THE REST OF THE NOBLES AND GENTRY WERE DISPERSED AMONG THE GREAT HOUSES OF FLORENCE AND THE TERRIBLE SOLDIERY WERE ENCAMPED IN THE PRATO AND OTHER OPEN QUARTERS THE BUSINESS OF THE DAY WAS ENDED BUT THE STREETS STILL PRESENTED A SURPRISING ASPECT SUCH AS FLORENTINES HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE UNDER THE NOVEMBER STARS
5115-26951-0019 INSTEAD OF A GLOOM UNBROKEN EXCEPT BY A LAMP BURNING FEEBLY HERE AND THERE BEFORE A SAINTLY IMAGE AT THE STREET CORNERS OR BY A STREAM OF REDDER LIGHT FROM AN OPEN DOORWAY THERE WERE LAMPS SUSPENDED AT THE WINDOWS OF ALL HOUSES
5115-26951-0020 SO THAT MEN COULD WALK ALONG NO LESS SECURELY AND COMMODIOUSLY THAN BY DAY FU GRAN MAGNIFICENZA ALONG THOSE ILLUMINATED STREETS TITO MELEMA WAS WALKING AT ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING ON HIS WAY HOMEWARD
5115-26951-0021 IF HE HAD ONLY NOT BEEN WANTING IN THE PRESENCE OF MIND NECESSARY TO RECOGNISE BALDASSARRE UNDER THAT SURPRISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPIER FOR HIM ON ALL ACCOUNTS FOR HE STILL WINCED UNDER THE SENSE THAT HE WAS DELIBERATELY INFLICTING SUFFERING ON HIS FATHER
5115-26951-0022 HE WOULD VERY MUCH HAVE PREFERRED THAT BALDASSARRE SHOULD BE PROSPEROUS AND HAPPY BUT HE HAD LEFT HIMSELF NO SECOND PATH NOW THERE COULD BE NO CONFLICT ANY LONGER THE ONLY THING HE HAD TO DO WAS TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF WHILE THESE THOUGHTS WERE IN HIS MIND HE WAS ADVANCING FROM THE PIAZZA DI SANTA CROCE
5115-26951-0023 AND AS HE NEARED THE ANGLE TURNING INTO THE BORGO SANTA CROCE HIS EAR WAS STRUCK BY A MUSIC WHICH WAS NOT THAT OF EVENING REVELRY BUT OF VIGOROUS LABOUR THE MUSIC OF THE ANVIL TITO GAVE A SLIGHT START AND QUICKENED HIS PACE FOR THE SOUNDS HAD SUGGESTED A WELCOME THOUGHT
5115-26951-0024 FAMOUS RESORT OF ALL FLORENTINES WHO CARED FOR CURIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL IRON WORK WHAT MAKES THE GIANT AT WORK SO LATE THOUGHT TITO BUT SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR ME I CAN DO THAT LITTLE BIT OF BUSINESS TO NIGHT INSTEAD OF TO MORROW MORNING
5115-26951-0025 AGAINST THE RED LIGHT FRAMED IN BY THE OUTLINE OF THE FLUTED TILES AND COLUMNS STOOD IN BLACK RELIEF THE GRAND FIGURE OF NICCOLO WITH HIS HUGE ARMS IN RHYTHMIC RISE AND FALL FIRST HIDING AND THEN DISCLOSING THE PROFILE OF HIS FIRM MOUTH AND POWERFUL BROW
5115-26951-0026 TWO SLIGHTER EBONY FIGURES ONE AT THE ANVIL THE OTHER AT THE BELLOWS SERVED TO SET OFF HIS SUPERIOR MASSIVENESS
5115-26951-0027 TO PAUSE AND NOTICE HIM THAT WAS NOT UNTIL THE SMITH HAD BEATEN THE HEAD OF AN AXE TO THE DUE SHARPNESS OF EDGE AND DISMISSED IT FROM HIS ANVIL BUT IN THE MEANTIME TITO HAD SATISFIED HIMSELF BY A GLANCE ROUND THE SHOP THAT THE OBJECT OF WHICH HE WAS IN SEARCH HAD NOT DISAPPEARED
5115-26951-0028 NICCOLO GAVE AN UNCEREMONIOUS BUT GOOD HUMOURED NOD AS HE TURNED FROM THE ANVIL AND RESTED HIS HAMMER ON HIS HIP WHAT IS IT MESSER TITO BUSINESS ASSUREDLY NICCOLO ELSE I SHOULD NOT HAVE VENTURED TO INTERRUPT YOU WHEN YOU ARE WORKING OUT OF HOURS SINCE I TAKE THAT AS A SIGN THAT YOUR WORK IS PRESSING
5115-26951-0029 AND EVERY FOOL THAT HAS PASSED MY SHOP HAS PUT HIS PUMPKIN HEAD IN TO SAY NICCOLO WILT THOU NOT COME AND SEE THE KING OF FRANCE AND HIS SOLDIERS AND I'VE ANSWERED NO I DON'T WANT TO SEE THEIR FACES I WANT TO SEE THEIR BACKS ARE YOU MAKING ARMS FOR THE CITIZENS THEN NICCOLO
5115-26951-0030 WE SHALL SEE ARMS ARE GOOD AND FLORENCE IS LIKELY TO WANT THEM THE FRATE TELLS US WE SHALL GET PISA AGAIN AND I HOLD WITH THE FRATE BUT I SHOULD BE GLAD TO KNOW HOW THE PROMISE IS TO BE FULFILLED IF WE DON'T GET PLENTY OF GOOD WEAPONS FORGED THE FRATE SEES A LONG WAY BEFORE HIM THAT I BELIEVE
5115-26951-0031 BUT HE DOESN'T SEE BIRDS CAUGHT WITH WINKING AT THEM AS SOME OF OUR PEOPLE TRY TO MAKE OUT HE SEES SENSE AND NOT NONSENSE
5115-26951-0032 EBBENE SO I'VE BEEN MYSELF IN MY TIME BEFORE THE CASK BEGAN TO RUN SOUR WHAT'S YOUR BUSINESS SIMPLY TO KNOW THE PRICE OF THAT FINE COAT OF MAIL I SAW HANGING UP HERE THE OTHER DAY
5115-26951-0033 LET HIM COME AND BUY IT HIMSELF THEN SAID NICCOLO BLUNTLY I'M RATHER NICE ABOUT WHAT I SELL AND WHOM I SELL TO I LIKE TO KNOW WHO'S MY CUSTOMER I KNOW YOUR SCRUPLES NICCOLO BUT THAT IS ONLY DEFENSIVE ARMOUR IT CAN HURT NOBODY
5115-26951-0034 TRUE BUT IT MAY MAKE THE MAN WHO WEARS IT FEEL HIMSELF ALL THE SAFER IF HE SHOULD WANT TO HURT SOMEBODY NO NO IT'S NOT MY OWN WORK BUT IT'S FINE WORK OF MASO OF BRESCIA I SHOULD BE LOTH FOR IT TO COVER THE HEART OF A SCOUNDREL I MUST KNOW WHO IS TO WEAR IT
5115-26951-0035 KNOWING IT WAS USELESS TO TRY PERSUASION THE FACT IS I AM LIKELY TO HAVE A JOURNEY TO TAKE AND YOU KNOW WHAT JOURNEYING IS IN THESE TIMES YOU DON'T SUSPECT ME OF TREASON AGAINST THE REPUBLIC NO I KNOW NO HARM OF YOU SAID NICCOLO IN HIS BLUNT WAY AGAIN
