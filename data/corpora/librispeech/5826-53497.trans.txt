5826-53497-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY NINE MISS LILY DALE'S LOGIC LADY JULIA DE GUEST ALWAYS LUNCHED AT ONE EXACTLY AND IT WAS NOT MUCH PAST TWELVE WHEN JOHN EAMES MADE HIS APPEARANCE AT THE COTTAGE
5826-53497-0001 LILY HERSELF WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE AT HER EASE PROTECTED BY LADY JULIA AND SOMEWHAT PROTECTED ALSO BY HER OWN POWERS OF FENCE HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT GRACE WAS THERE ALSO BUT GRACE CRAWLEY
5826-53497-0002 HAD BY NO MEANS BEEN AT HER EASE LILY SAW AT ONCE THAT SHE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO JOIN IN ANY CONVERSATION AND BOTH JOHN AND LADY JULIA IN THEIR IGNORANCE OF THE MATTER IN HAND MADE MATTERS WORSE SO THAT WAS MAJOR GRANTLY SAID JOHN
5826-53497-0003 I WONDER WHAT HE'S DOING AT ALLINGTON SAID JOHNNY I THINK HE KNOWS MY UNCLE SAID LILY BUT HE'S GOING TO CALL ON YOUR MOTHER HE SAID THEN JOHNNY REMEMBERED THAT THE MAJOR HAD SAID SOMETHING AS TO KNOWING MISS CRAWLEY AND FOR THE MOMENT HE WAS SILENT
5826-53497-0004 AND I REMEMBER HEARING THAT HE WAS TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED HE IS GETTING TO BE AN OLD MAN NOW I SUPPOSE AND YET DEAR ME HOW WELL I REMEMBER HIS FATHER HE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE A BISHOP'S SON SAID JOHNNY HOW DOES A BISHOP'S SON LOOK LILY ASKED
5826-53497-0005 I SUPPOSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF CLERICAL TINGE ABOUT HIM BUT THIS FELLOW HAD NOTHING OF THAT KIND BUT THEN THIS FELLOW AS YOU CALL HIM SAID LILY IS ONLY THE SON OF AN ARCHDEACON THAT ACCOUNTS FOR IT I SUPPOSE SAID JOHNNY
5826-53497-0006 BUT DURING ALL THIS TIME GRACE DID NOT SAY A WORD AND LILY PERCEIVED IT THEN SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF AS TO WHAT SHE HAD BETTER DO GRACE SHE KNEW COULD NOT BE COMFORTABLE WHERE SHE WAS NOR INDEED WAS IT PROBABLE THAT GRACE WOULD BE VERY COMFORTABLE IN RETURNING HOME
5826-53497-0007 THERE COULD NOT BE MUCH EASE FOR GRACE TILL THE COMING MEETING BETWEEN HER AND MAJOR GRANTLY SHOULD BE OVER BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER THAT GRACE SHOULD GO BACK TO ALLINGTON AT ONCE AND BETTER ALSO PERHAPS FOR MAJOR GRANTLY THAT IT SHOULD BE SO
5826-53497-0008 LADY JULIA SHE SAID I DON'T THINK WE'LL MIND STOPPING FOR LUNCH TO DAY NONSENSE MY DEAR YOU PROMISED I THINK WE MUST BREAK OUR PROMISE I DO INDEED YOU MUSTN'T BE ANGRY WITH US AND LILY LOOKED AT LADY JULIA AS THOUGH THERE WERE SOMETHING
5826-53497-0009 WHICH LADY JULIA OUGHT TO UNDERSTAND WHICH SHE LILY COULD NOT QUITE EXPLAIN I FEAR THAT LILY WAS FALSE AND INTENDED HER OLD FRIEND TO BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS RUNNING AWAY BECAUSE JOHN EAMES HAD COME THERE BUT YOU WILL BE FAMISHED SAID LADY JULIA
5826-53497-0010 WE SHALL LIVE THROUGH IT SAID LILY IT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT I SHOULD LET YOU WALK ALL THE WAY HERE FROM ALLINGTON AND ALL THE WAY BACK WITHOUT TAKING SOMETHING WE SHALL JUST BE HOME IN TIME FOR LUNCH IF WE GO NOW SAID LILY WILL NOT THAT BE BEST GRACE
5826-53497-0011 GRACE HARDLY KNEW WHAT WOULD BE BEST SHE ONLY KNEW THAT MAJOR GRANTLY WAS AT ALLINGTON AND THAT HE HAD COME THITHER TO SEE HER THE IDEA OF HURRYING BACK AFTER HIM WAS UNPLEASANT TO HER
5826-53497-0012 JOHN EAMES WHO IN TRUTH BELIEVED THAT LILY DALE WAS RUNNING AWAY FROM HIM WAS BY NO MEANS WELL PLEASED AND WHEN THE GIRLS WERE GONE DID NOT MAKE HIMSELF SO AGREEABLE TO HIS OLD FRIEND AS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE
5826-53497-0013 THAT'S VERY CIVIL TO ME JOHN YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LADY JULIA
5826-53497-0014 AND NOT ON HER OWN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT LILY WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU AND WHEN I TOLD HER THAT YOU WERE COMING TO STAY HERE AND WOULD BE NEAR THEM FOR SOME DAYS SHE SEEMED TO BE QUITE PLEASED SHE DID INDEED THEN WHY DID SHE RUN AWAY THE MOMENT I CAME IN SAID JOHNNY
5826-53497-0015 I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING YOU SAID ABOUT THAT MAN WHO HAS GONE TO ALLINGTON WHAT DIFFERENCE CAN THE MAN MAKE TO HER THE TRUTH IS I DESPISE MYSELF I DO INDEED LADY JULIA
5826-53497-0016 IF I THOUGHT SHE DID I WOULD NEVER SPEAK ANOTHER WORD TO HER I MEAN ABOUT MYSELF
5826-53497-0017 THEN LADY JULIA TRIED TO COMFORT HIM AND SUCCEEDED SO FAR THAT HE WAS INDUCED TO EAT THE MINCE VEAL THAT HAD BEEN INTENDED FOR THE COMFORT AND SUPPORT OF THE TWO YOUNG LADIES WHO HAD RUN AWAY
5826-53497-0018 AND THE WORSHIP WHICH IS DUE TO A TRUE MAN THEN SHE WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT BUT GRACE SAID NOTHING AND LILY CONTINUED I TELL YOU FAIRLY GRACE THAT I SHALL EXPECT VERY MUCH FROM YOU NOW MUCH IN WHAT WAY LILY IN THE WAY OF WORSHIP
5826-53497-0019 I SHALL NOT BE CONTENT THAT YOU SHOULD MERELY LOVE HIM IF HE HAS COME HERE AS HE MUST HAVE DONE TO SAY THAT THE MOMENT OF THE WORLD'S REPROACH IS THE MOMENT HE HAS CHOSEN TO ASK YOU TO BE HIS WIFE
5826-53497-0020 I THINK THAT YOU WILL OWE HIM MORE THAN LOVE I SHALL OWE HIM MORE THAN LOVE AND I WILL PAY HIM MORE THAN LOVE SAID GRACE THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE TONE OF HER VOICE AS SHE SPOKE WHICH MADE LILY STOP HER AND LOOK UP INTO HER FACE
5826-53497-0021 THERE WAS A SMILE THERE WHICH LILY HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND WHICH GAVE A BEAUTY TO HER WHICH WAS WONDERFUL TO LILY'S EYES
5826-53497-0022 AND THEREFORE HAD LOVED HER AND WAS GIVING SUCH WONDERFUL PROOF OF HIS LOVE YES CONTINUED GRACE STANDING AND LOOKING AT HER FRIEND YOU MAY STARE AT ME LILY BUT YOU MAY BE SURE THAT I WILL DO FOR MAJOR GRANTLY ALL THE GOOD THAT I CAN DO FOR HIM WHAT DO YOU MEAN GRACE
5826-53497-0023 NEVER MIND WHAT I MEAN YOU ARE VERY IMPERIOUS IN MANAGING YOUR OWN AFFAIRS AND YOU MUST LET ME BE SO EQUALLY IN MINE BUT I TELL YOU EVERYTHING DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT IF
5826-53497-0024 CERTAINLY WHY NOT THERE WILL BE NO SACRIFICE HE WILL BE ASKING FOR THAT WHICH HE WISHES TO GET AND YOU WILL BE BOUND TO GIVE IT TO HIM IF HE WANTS IT WHERE IS HIS NOBILITY
5826-53497-0025 THAT HE HAS BEEN WILLING TO TAKE THAT WHICH HE DOES NOT WANT IN ORDER THAT HE MAY SUCCOUR ONE WHOM HE LOVES I ALSO WILL SUCCOUR ONE WHOM I LOVE AS BEST I KNOW HOW THEN SHE WALKED ON QUICKLY BEFORE HER FRIEND AND LILY STOOD FOR A MOMENT THINKING BEFORE SHE FOLLOWED HER
5826-53497-0026 THEY WERE NOW ON A FIELD PATH BY WHICH THEY WERE ENABLED TO ESCAPE THE ROAD BACK TO ALLINGTON FOR THE GREATER PART OF THE DISTANCE AND GRACE HAD REACHED A STILE AND HAD CLAMBERED OVER IT BEFORE LILY HAD CAUGHT HER YOU MUST NOT GO AWAY BY YOURSELF SAID LILY
5826-53497-0027 IF THAT BE THE CASE AND IF YOU ALSO LOVE HIM I DO I MAKE NO MYSTERY ABOUT THAT TO YOU I DO LOVE HIM WITH ALL MY HEART I LOVE HIM TO DAY NOW THAT I BELIEVE HIM TO BE HERE AND THAT I SUPPOSE I SHALL SEE HIM PERHAPS THIS VERY AFTERNOON
5826-53497-0028 AND I LOVED HIM YESTERDAY WHEN I THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN I DO LOVE HIM I DO I LOVE HIM SO WELL THAT I WILL NEVER DO HIM AN INJURY THAT BEING SO IF HE MAKES YOU AN OFFER YOU ARE BOUND TO ACCEPT IT
5826-53497-0029 I HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE AND I SHALL USE IT WHY DON'T YOU TAKE MY COUSIN JOHN BECAUSE I LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE BETTER
5826-53497-0030 BECAUSE I CANNOT TRUST HIS LOVE THAT IS WHY IT IS NOT VERY KIND OF YOU OPENING MY SORES AFRESH WHEN I AM TRYING TO HEAL YOURS OH LILY AM I UNKIND UNKIND TO YOU WHO HAVE BEEN SO GENEROUS TO ME
5826-53497-0031 I'LL FORGIVE YOU ALL THAT AND A DEAL MORE IF YOU WILL ONLY LISTEN TO ME AND TRY TO TAKE MY ADVICE BECAUSE THIS MAJOR OF YOURS DOES A GENEROUS THING WHICH IS FOR THE GOOD OF YOU BOTH THE INFINITE GOOD OF BOTH OF YOU
5826-53497-0032 YOU ARE TO EMULATE HIS GENEROSITY BY DOING A THING WHICH WILL BE FOR THE GOOD OF NEITHER OF YOU THAT IS ABOUT IT YES IT IS GRACE YOU CANNOT DOUBT THAT HE HAS BEEN MEANING THIS FOR SOME TIME PAST AND OF COURSE IF HE LOOKS UPON YOU AS HIS OWN
5826-53497-0033 BUT I AM NOT HIS OWN YES YOU ARE IN ONE SENSE YOU HAVE JUST SAID SO WITH A GREAT DEAL OF ENERGY AND IF IT IS SO LET ME SEE WHERE WAS I
5826-53497-0034 BUT I DO MIND AND I HATE TO BE INTERRUPTED IN MY ARGUMENTS YES JUST THAT IF HE SAW HIS COW SICK HE'D TRY TO DOCTOR THE COW IN HER SICKNESS
5826-53497-0035 I AM NOT MAJOR GRANTLY'S COW YES YOU ARE NOR HIS DOG NOR HIS OX NOR HIS ASS NOR ANYTHING THAT IS HIS EXCEPT EXCEPT LILY THE DEAREST FRIEND THAT HE HAS ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH
5826-53497-0036 HE CANNOT HAVE A FRIEND THAT WILL GO FURTHER FOR HIM THAN I WILL HE WILL NEVER KNOW HOW FAR I WILL GO TO SERVE HIM YOU DON'T KNOW HIS PEOPLE NOR DO I KNOW THEM BUT I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE
5826-53497-0037 WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH IT SAID LILY SHARPLY IF SHE WERE MARRIED TO AN ARCHDUKE WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD THAT MAKE AND THEY ARE PROUD PEOPLE ALL OF THEM AND RICH AND THEY LIVE WITH HIGH PERSONS IN THE WORLD
5826-53497-0038 I DIDN'T CARE THOUGH THEY LIVED WITH THE ROYAL FAMILY AND HAD THE PRINCE OF WALES FOR THEIR BOSOM FRIEND IT ONLY SHOWS HOW MUCH BETTER HE IS THAN THEY ARE BUT THINK WHAT MY FAMILY IS HOW WE ARE SITUATED
5826-53497-0039 BUT NOW HE IS DISGRACED YES LILY HE IS I AM BOUND TO SAY SO AT ANY RATE TO MYSELF WHEN I AM THINKING OF MAJOR GRANTLY AND I WILL NOT CARRY THAT DISGRACE INTO A FAMILY WHICH WOULD FEEL IT SO KEENLY AS THEY WOULD DO
