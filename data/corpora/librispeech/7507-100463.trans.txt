7507-100463-0000 HE TAKES HIS PLACE WITH BRITTLEBONES IN THE GALLERY OF FREAKS THE SUBJECT FOR ESSAY HAS FREQUENTLY BEEN GIVEN IF A MILLION POUNDS WERE LEFT TO YOU
7507-100463-0001 HOW COULD YOU DO MOST GOOD WITH IT SOME SAY THEY WOULD ENDOW HOSPITALS SOME
7507-100463-0002 THERE MAY EVEN BE SOME WHO WOULD GO AS FAR AS TO BUILD HALF A DREADNOUGHT BUT THERE WOULD BE A MORE DECISIVE WAY OF DOING GOOD THAN ANY OF THESE YOU MIGHT
7507-100463-0003 REFUSE THE MILLION POUNDS THAT WOULD BE A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEMS OF THE COMFORTABLE A BLOW STRUCK AT THE GREAT MONEY GOD WHICH WOULD MAKE IT TOTTER A THRUST IN DEFENCE OF PRIDE
7507-100463-0004 THAT WOULD BE A MORAL TONIC MORE NEEDED THAN ALL THE DRAUGHTS OF YOUR NEWLY ENDOWED HOSPITALS WILL IT EVER BE ADMINISTERED WELL PERHAPS WHEN THE D W T CLUB HAS GROWN A LITTLE STRONGER
7507-100463-0005 HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE D W T THE DECLINED WITH THANKS CLUB THERE ARE NO CLUB ROOMS AND NOT MANY MEMBERS BUT THE BALANCE SHEET FOR THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS IS WONDERFUL SHOWING THAT MORE THAN
7507-100463-0006 IS ONE HUNDRED GUINEAS AND THE ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTION FIFTY GUINEAS THAT IS TO SAY YOU MUST HAVE REFUSED A HUNDRED GUINEAS BEFORE YOU CAN BE ELECTED AND YOU ARE EXPECTED TO REFUSE
7507-100463-0007 ANOTHER FIFTY GUINEAS A YEAR WHILE YOU RETAIN MEMBERSHIP IT IS POSSIBLE ALSO TO COMPOUND WITH A LIFE REFUSAL BUT THE SUM IS NOT FIXED
7507-100463-0008 AND REMAINS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMMITTEE BAINES IS A LIFE MEMBER HE SAVED AN OLD LADY FROM BEING RUN OVER BY A MOTOR BUS SOME YEARS AGO AND WHEN SHE DIED SHE LEFT HIM A LEGACY
7507-100463-0009 BAINES WROTE TO THE EXECUTORS AND POINTED OUT THAT HE DID NOT GO ABOUT DRAGGING PERSONS FROM BENEATH MOTOR BUSES AS A PROFESSION THAT IF SHE HAD OFFERED HIM
7507-100463-0010 HE WOULD HAVE REFUSED IT NOT BEING IN THE HABIT OF ACCEPTING MONEY FROM STRANGERS STILL LESS FROM WOMEN AND THAT HE DID NOT SEE THAT THE FACT OF THE MONEY BEING OFFERED TWO YEARS LATER IN A WILL
7507-100463-0011 MADE THE SLIGHTEST DIFFERENCE
7507-100463-0012 AND HAD A WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN BUT HE WILL NOT ADMIT THAT HE DID ANYTHING AT ALL OUT OF THE COMMON THE CASE OF SEDLEY COMES UP FOR CONSIDERATION AT THE NEXT COMMITTEE MEETING SEDLEY'S RICH UNCLE
7507-100463-0013 A CANTANKEROUS OLD MAN INSULTED HIM GROSSLY
7507-100463-0014 AND THE OLD MAN LEFT VOWING TO REVENGE HIMSELF BY DISINHERITING HIS NEPHEW AND BEQUEATHING HIS MONEY TO A CATS HOME HE DIED ON HIS WAY TO HIS SOLICITORS AND SEDLEY
7507-100463-0015 WAS TOLD OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE IN GOOD LEGAL ENGLISH HE REPLIED WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU TAKE ME FOR I WOULDN'T TOUCH A PENNY GIVE IT TO THE CATS HOME OR ANY BLESSED THING YOU LIKE
7507-100463-0016 SEDLEY OF COURSE WILL BE ELECTED AS AN ORDINARY MEMBER BUT AS THERE IS A STRONG FEELING ON THE COMMITTEE THAT NO DECENT MAN COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING ELSE
7507-100463-0017 HIS ELECTION AS A LIFE MEMBER IS IMPROBABLE THOUGH THERE ARE ONE OR TWO OTHER MEMBERS LIKE BAINES AND SEDLEY MOST OF THEM ARE MEN WHO HAVE REFUSED PROFESSIONAL OPENINGS RATHER THAN ACTUAL MONEY
7507-100463-0018 THERE ARE FOR INSTANCE HALF A DOZEN JOURNALISTS AND AUTHORS NOW A JOURNALIST BEFORE HE CAN BE ELECTED MUST HAVE A BLACK LIST OF PAPERS FOR WHICH HE WILL REFUSE TO WRITE
7507-100463-0019 A CONCOCTED WIRELESS MESSAGE IN THE DAILY BLANK WHICH SUBSEQUENT EVENTS PROVED TO HAVE BEEN INVENTED DELIBERATELY
7507-100463-0020 SO INFURIATED HENDERSON TO TAKE A CASE THAT HE HAS PLEDGED HIMSELF NEVER TO WRITE A LINE FOR ANY PAPER OWNED BY THE SAME PROPRIETORS CURIOUSLY ENOUGH
7507-100463-0021 HE WAS ASKED A DAY OR TWO LATER TO CONTRIBUTE A SERIES TO A MOST RESPECTABLE MAGAZINE PUBLISHED BY THIS FIRM HE REFUSED IN A LETTER WHICH BREATHED HATRED
7507-100463-0022 AND UTTER CONTEMPT IN EVERY WORD IT WAS HENDERSON TOO WHO RESIGNED HIS POSITION AS DRAMATIC CRITIC BECAUSE THE PROPRIETOR OF HIS PAPER DID RATHER A SHADY THING IN PRIVATE LIFE
7507-100463-0023 I KNOW THE PAPER ISN'T MIXED UP IN IT AT ALL HE SAID BUT HE'S MY EMPLOYER AND HE PAYS ME WELL I LIKE TO BE LOYAL TO MY EMPLOYERS AND IF I'M LOYAL TO THIS MAN
7507-100463-0024 I CAN'T GO ABOUT TELLING EVERYBODY THAT HE'S A DIRTY CAD AS I PARTICULARLY WANT TO THEN THERE IS THE CASE OF BOLUS THE AUTHOR HE IS ONLY AN HONORARY MEMBER FOR HE HAS NOT
7507-100463-0025 AS YET HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF REFUSING MONEY OR WORK BUT HE HAS REFUSED TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED AND INTERVIEWED AND HE HAS REFUSED TO CONTRIBUTE TO SYMPOSIA IN THE MONTHLY MAGAZINES
7507-100463-0026 HE HAS DECLINED WITH THANKS MOREOVER INVITATIONS TO HALF A DOZEN HOUSES SENT TO HIM BY HOSTESSES WHO ONLY KNEW HIM BY REPUTATION MYSELF
7507-100463-0027 I THINK IT IS TIME THAT HE WAS ELECTED A FULL MEMBER INDIRECTLY HE MUST HAVE BEEN A FINANCIAL LOSER BY HIS ACTION AND EVEN IF HE IS NOT ACTUALLY ASSISTING TO TOPPLE OVER THE MONEY GOD
7507-100463-0028 HE IS AT LEAST STRIKING A BLOW FOR THE CAUSE OF INDEPENDENCE HOWEVER THERE HE IS AND WITH HIM GOES A CERTAIN M P WHO CONTRIBUTED
7507-100463-0029 AND REFUSED SCORNFULLY THE PEERAGE WHICH WAS OFFERED TO HIM THE BAR IS REPRESENTED BY P J BREWSTER WHO WAS ELECTED FOR REFUSING TO DEFEND A SUSPECTED MURDERER
7507-100463-0030 BUT MERELY PUT THE CASE FOR ONE SIDE IN A PERFECTLY DETACHED WAY ACCORDING TO THE BEST TRADITIONS OF THE BAR BREWSTER REPLIED THAT HE WAS ALSO QUITE CAPABLE OF PUTTING THE CASE FOR TARIFF REFORM
7507-100463-0031 IN A PERFECTLY DETACHED WAY ACCORDING TO THE BEST TRADITIONS OF THE MORNING POST BUT AS HE WAS A FREE TRADER HE THOUGHT HE WOULD REFUSE ANY SUCH OFFER IF IT WERE MADE TO HIM HE ADDED HOWEVER
7507-100463-0032 THAT HE WAS NOT IN THE PRESENT CASE WORRYING ABOUT MORAL POINTS OF VIEW HE WAS SIMPLY EXPRESSING HIS OPINION THAT THE LUXURY OF NOT HAVING LITTLE NOTES PASSED TO HIM IN COURT
7507-100463-0033 BY A PROBABLE MURDERER OF NOT SHARING A PAGE IN AN ILLUSTRATED PAPER WITH HIM AND OF NOT HAVING TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM IF HE WERE ACQUITTED WAS WORTH PAYING FOR LATER ON
