705-150468-0002 THAT WHEN THE LATTER LOOKED IN AFTER SUPPER HE PRETENDED TO BE ASLEEP AND EARLY NEXT MORNING WENT AWAY AVOIDING BORIS IN HIS CIVILIAN CLOTHES AND A ROUND HAT HE WANDERED ABOUT THE TOWN
705-150468-0003 STARING AT THE FRENCH AND THEIR UNIFORMS AND AT THE STREETS AND HOUSES WHERE THE RUSSIAN AND FRENCH EMPERORS WERE STAYING IN A SQUARE HE SAW TABLES BEING SET UP AND PREPARATIONS MADE FOR THE DINNER
705-150468-0004 HE SAW THE RUSSIAN AND FRENCH COLORS DRAPED FROM SIDE TO SIDE OF THE STREETS WITH HUGE MONOGRAMS A AND N
705-150468-0005 BORIS DOESN'T WANT TO HELP ME AND I DON'T WANT TO ASK HIM
705-150468-0006 THOUGHT ROSTOV WHO HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY RETURNED TO THE HOUSE WHERE ALEXANDER LODGED SADDLED HORSES WERE STANDING BEFORE THE HOUSE

705-150468-0012 BELOW UNDER THE STAIRCASE WAS A DOOR LEADING TO THE LOWER FLOOR WHOM DO YOU WANT SOMEONE INQUIRED
705-150468-0013 THE DOOR LEADING DOWNSTAIRS ONLY IT WON'T BE ACCEPTED ON HEARING THIS INDIFFERENT VOICE ROSTOV GREW FRIGHTENED AT WHAT HE WAS DOING
705-150468-0014 THE THOUGHT OF MEETING THE EMPEROR AT ANY MOMENT WAS SO FASCINATING AND CONSEQUENTLY SO ALARMING THAT HE WAS READY TO RUN AWAY BUT THE OFFICIAL WHO HAD QUESTIONED HIM OPENED THE DOOR AND ROSTOV ENTERED
705-150468-0015 AND HIS VALET WAS BUTTONING ON TO THE BACK OF HIS BREECHES A NEW PAIR OF HANDSOME SILK EMBROIDERED BRACES THAT FOR SOME REASON ATTRACTED ROSTOV'S ATTENTION
705-150468-0016 THIS MAN WAS SPEAKING TO SOMEONE IN THE ADJOINING ROOM A GOOD FIGURE AND IN HER FIRST BLOOM
705-150468-0017 HE WAS SAYING BUT ON SEEING ROSTOV HE STOPPED SHORT AND FROWNED WHAT IS IT A PETITION WHAT IS IT ASKED THE PERSON IN THE OTHER ROOM ANOTHER PETITIONER ANSWERED THE MAN WITH THE BRACES

705-150468-0020 LIEUTENANT COUNT ROSTOV WHAT AUDACITY
705-150468-0021 WHOM HE HAD TO PASS CURSING HIS TEMERITY HIS HEART SINKING AT THE THOUGHT OF FINDING HIMSELF AT ANY MOMENT FACE TO FACE WITH THE EMPEROR AND BEING PUT TO SHAME
705-150468-0022 AND ARRESTED IN HIS PRESENCE FULLY ALIVE NOW TO THE IMPROPRIETY OF HIS CONDUCT AND REPENTING OF IT ROSTOV WITH DOWNCAST EYES WAS MAKING HIS WAY OUT OF THE HOUSE
705-150468-0023 THROUGH THE BRILLIANT SUITE WHEN A FAMILIAR VOICE CALLED HIM AND A HAND DETAINED HIM WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE SIR IN CIVILIAN DRESS ASKED A DEEP VOICE
705-150468-0024 BUT SEEING THE KINDLY JOCULAR FACE OF THE GENERAL HE TOOK HIM ASIDE AND IN AN EXCITED VOICE TOLD HIM THE WHOLE AFFAIR ASKING HIM TO INTERCEDE FOR DENISOV WHOM THE GENERAL KNEW
705-150468-0025 HAVING HEARD ROSTOV TO THE END THE GENERAL SHOOK HIS HEAD GRAVELY I'M SORRY SORRY FOR THAT FINE FELLOW GIVE ME THE LETTER
705-150468-0026 HARDLY HAD ROSTOV HANDED HIM THE LETTER AND FINISHED EXPLAINING DENISOV'S CASE WHEN HASTY STEPS AND THE JINGLING OF SPURS WERE HEARD ON THE STAIRS
705-150468-0027 THE GENTLEMEN OF THE EMPEROR'S SUITE
705-150468-0028 HAYNE THE SAME GROOM WHO HAD BEEN AT AUSTERLITZ LED UP THE EMPEROR'S HORSE
705-150468-0029 AND AGAIN AFTER TWO YEARS SAW THOSE FEATURES HE ADORED THAT SAME FACE AND SAME LOOK AND STEP AND THE SAME UNION OF MAJESTY
705-150468-0030 AND THE FEELING OF ENTHUSIASM AND LOVE FOR HIS SOVEREIGN
705-150468-0031 IN ALL ITS OLD FORCE IN THE UNIFORM OF THE PREOBRAZHENSK REGIMENT WHITE CHAMOIS LEATHER BREECHES AND HIGH BOOTS AND WEARING A STAR ROSTOV DID NOT KNOW IT WAS THAT OF THE LEGION D'HONNEUR
705-150468-0032 THE MONARCH CAME OUT INTO THE PORCH PUTTING ON HIS GLOVES AND CARRYING HIS HAT UNDER HIS ARM
705-150468-0033 ALL THE SUITE DREW BACK AND ROSTOV SAW THE GENERAL TALKING FOR SOME TIME TO THE EMPEROR THE EMPEROR SAID A FEW WORDS TO HIM AND TOOK A STEP TOWARD HIS HORSE
705-150468-0034 AGAIN THE CROWD OF MEMBERS OF THE SUITE AND STREET GAZERS AMONG WHOM WAS ROSTOV MOVED NEARER TO THE EMPEROR
705-150468-0035 STOPPING BESIDE HIS HORSE WITH HIS HAND ON THE SADDLE THE EMPEROR TURNED TO THE CAVALRY GENERAL AND SAID IN A LOUD VOICE EVIDENTLY WISHING TO BE HEARD BY ALL I CANNOT DO IT GENERAL
705-150468-0036 I CANNOT BECAUSE THE LAW IS STRONGER THAN I AND HE RAISED HIS FOOT TO THE STIRRUP THE GENERAL BOWED HIS HEAD RESPECTFULLY
705-150468-0037 AND THE MONARCH MOUNTED AND RODE DOWN THE STREET AT A GALLOP BESIDE HIMSELF WITH ENTHUSIASM
