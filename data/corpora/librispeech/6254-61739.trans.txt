6254-61739-0007 THE DOOR OF THE STABLE AS IS CUSTOMARY IN MEXICAN HACIENDAS OPENED UPON THE PAVED PATIO IT WAS STANDING AJAR BUT JUST AS CALHOUN TURNED HIS EYE UPON IT A MAN COMING FROM THE INSIDE PUSHED IT WIDE OPEN
6254-61739-0008 AND THEN STEPPED OVER THE THRESHOLD WITH A SADDLED HORSE FOLLOWING CLOSE AFTER HIM THE MAN HAD A PANAMA HAT UPON HIS HEAD AND A CLOAK THROWN LOOSELY AROUND HIS SHOULDERS THIS DID NOT HINDER CALHOUN FROM RECOGNISING HIS COUSIN HENRY
6254-61739-0009 AS ALSO THE DARK BROWN HORSE THAT BELONGED TO HIM FOOL SO YOU'VE LET HIM OFF SPITEFULLY MUTTERED THE EX CAPTAIN AS THE OTHER CAME WITHIN WHISPERING DISTANCE GIVE ME BACK MY BOWIE AND PISTOL

6254-61739-0012 FORTUNATELY I DID NOT GO SO FAR I HAVE DONE ENOUGH TO DESERVE BEING CALLED WORSE THAN FOOL THOUGH PERHAPS UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I MAY OBTAIN FORGIVENESS FOR MY FAULT AT ALL EVENTS I INTEND TO TRY FOR IT
6254-61739-0013 AND WITHOUT LOSING TIME WHERE ARE YOU GOING AFTER MAURICE THE MUSTANGER TO APOLOGISE TO HIM FOR MY MISCONDUCT
6254-61739-0014 HA HA HA SURELY YOU ARE JOKING NO I'M IN EARNEST IF YOU COME ALONG WITH ME YOU SHALL SEE THEN I SAY AGAIN YOU ARE MAD NOT ONLY MAD BUT A DAMNED NATURAL BORN IDIOT

6254-61739-0016 AND MAKE AMENDS FOR YOUR RUDENESS WITHOUT ADDING ANOTHER WORD THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN ONE OF THE SOMEWHAT RARE TYPES OF SOUTHERN CHIVALRY SPRANG TO HIS SADDLE GAVE THE WORD TO HIS HORSE AND RODE HURRIEDLY THROUGH THE SAGUAN
6254-61739-0017 CALHOUN STOOD UPON THE STONES TILL THE FOOTFALL OF THE HORSE BECAME BUT FAINTLY DISTINGUISHABLE IN THE DISTANCE THEN AS IF ACTING UNDER SOME SUDDEN IMPULSE HE HURRIED ALONG THE VERANDAH TO HIS OWN ROOM
6254-61739-0018 ENTERED IT REAPPEARED IN A ROUGH OVERCOAT CROSSED BACK TO THE STABLE WENT IN CAME OUT AGAIN WITH HIS OWN HORSE SADDLED AND BRIDLED LED THE ANIMAL ALONG THE PAVEMENT AS GENTLY AS IF HE WAS STEALING HIM
6254-61739-0019 AND ONCE OUTSIDE UPON THE TURF SPRANG UPON HIS BACK AND RODE RAPIDLY AWAY FOR A MILE OR MORE HE FOLLOWED THE SAME ROAD THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN BY HENRY POINDEXTER
6254-61739-0020 IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WITH ANY IDEA OF OVERTAKING THE LATTER SINCE LONG BEFORE THE HOOFSTROKES OF HENRY'S HORSE HAD CEASED TO BE HEARD AND PROCEEDING AT A SLOWER PACE CALHOUN DID NOT RIDE AS IF HE CARED ABOUT CATCHING UP WITH HIS COUSIN
6254-61739-0021 HE HAD TAKEN THE UP RIVER ROAD WHEN ABOUT MIDWAY BETWEEN CASA DEL CORVO AND THE FORT HE REINED UP AND AFTER SCRUTINISING THE CHAPPARAL AROUND HIM STRUCK OFF BY A BRIDLE PATH LEADING BACK TOWARD THE BANK OF THE RIVER
6254-61739-0022 AS HE TURNED INTO IT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HEARD MUTTERING TO HIMSELF A CHANCE STILL LEFT A GOOD ONE THOUGH NOT SO CHEAP AS THE OTHER IT WILL COST ME A THOUSAND DOLLARS
6254-61739-0023 SO LONG AS I GET RID OF THIS IRISH CURSE WHO HAS POISONED EVERY HOUR OF MY EXISTENCE IF TRUE TO HIS PROMISE HE TAKES THE ROUTE TO HIS HOME BY AN EARLY HOUR IN THE MORNING WHAT TIME I WONDER
6254-61739-0024 THESE MEN OF THE PRAIRIES CALL IT LATE RISING IF THEY BE ABED TILL DAYBREAK NEVER MIND
6254-61739-0025 I KNOW THAT IT MUST BE THE SAME AS WE FOLLOWED TO THE WILD HORSE PRAIRIES HE SPOKE OF HIS HUT UPON THE ALAMO THAT'S THE NAME OF THE CREEK WHERE WE HAD OUR PIC NIC THE HOVEL CANNOT BE FAR FROM THERE
6254-61739-0026 THE MEXICAN MUST KNOW THE PLACE OR THE TRAIL LEADING TO IT WHICH LAST WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR HIS PURPOSE AND MINE A FIG FOR THE SHANTY ITSELF THE OWNER MAY NEVER REACH IT THERE MAY BE INDIANS UPON THE ROAD
6254-61739-0027 THERE MUST BE BEFORE DAYBREAK IN THE MORNING AS CALHOUN CONCLUDED THIS STRING OF STRANGE REFLECTIONS HE HAD ARRIVED AT THE DOOR OF ANOTHER SHANTY THAT OF THE MEXICAN MUSTANGER
6254-61739-0028 HAVING SLIPPED OUT OF HIS SADDLE AND KNOTTED HIS BRIDLE TO A BRANCH HE SET FOOT UPON THE THRESHOLD THE DOOR WAS STANDING WIDE OPEN FROM THE INSIDE PROCEEDED A SOUND EASILY IDENTIFIED AS THE SNORE OF A SLUMBERER
6254-61739-0029 IT WAS NOT AS OF ONE WHO SLEEPS EITHER TRANQUILLY OR CONTINUOUSLY AT SHORT INTERVALS IT WAS INTERRUPTED NOW BY SILENT PAUSES ANON BY HOG LIKE GRUNTINGS
6254-61739-0030 INTERSPERSED WITH PROFANE WORDS NOT PERFECTLY PRONOUNCED BUT SLURRED FROM A THICK TONGUE OVER WHICH BUT A SHORT WHILE BEFORE MUST HAVE PASSED A STUPENDOUS QUANTITY OF ALCOHOL
6254-61739-0031 PERHAPS LESS REVERENTIAL EXCLAMATIONS OF
6254-61739-0032 AS IF THE SPEAKER WAS ENGAGED IN AN APOSTROPHIC CONVERSATION WITH ALL THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTERS OF THE POPISH PANTHEON CALHOUN PAUSED UPON THE THRESHOLD AND LISTENED
6254-61739-0033 HALF INTERROGATIVELY HALF UNCONSCIOUSLY AT THE INDIVIDUAL WHOSE VOICE HAD INTRUDED ITSELF INTO HIS DRUNKEN DREAMS THE UNSTEADY EXAMINATION LASTED ONLY FOR A SCORE OF SECONDS
6254-61739-0034 WITH AN UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH SUBSIDED INTO A RECUMBENT POSITION WHEN A SAVAGE GRUNT SUCCEEDED BY A PROLONGED SNORE PROVED HIM TO HAVE BECOME OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT THAT HIS DOMICILE CONTAINED A GUEST
6254-61739-0035 ANOTHER CHANCE LOST SAID THE LATTER HISSING THE WORDS THROUGH HIS TEETH AS HE TURNED DISAPPOINTEDLY FROM THE DOOR A SOBER FOOL AND A DRUNKEN KNAVE TWO PRECIOUS TOOLS WHEREWITH TO ACCOMPLISH A PURPOSE LIKE MINE
6254-61739-0036 CURSE THE LUCK ALL THIS NIGHT IT'S BEEN AGAINST ME IT MAYBE THREE LONG HOURS BEFORE THIS PIG SLEEPS OFF THE SWILL THAT HAS STUPEFIED HIM THREE LONG HOURS AND THEN WHAT WOULD BE THE USE OF HIM TWOULD BE TOO LATE TOO LATE
6254-61739-0037 AS HE SAID THIS HE CAUGHT THE REIN OF HIS BRIDLE AND STOOD BY THE HEAD OF HIS HORSE AS IF UNCERTAIN WHAT COURSE TO PURSUE NO USE MY STAYING HERE IT MIGHT BE DAYBREAK BEFORE THE DAMNED LIQUOR GETS OUT OF HIS SKULL
6254-61739-0038 I MAY AS WELL GO BACK TO THE HACIENDA AND WAIT THERE OR ELSE OR ELSE THE ALTERNATIVE THAT AT THIS CRISIS PRESENTED ITSELF WAS NOR SPOKEN ALOUD
6254-61739-0039 ROUGHLY TEARING HIS REIN FROM THE BRANCH AND PASSING IT OVER HIS HORSE'S HEAD
