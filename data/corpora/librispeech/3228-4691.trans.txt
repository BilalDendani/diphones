3228-4691-0000 AND AT THE LAST HE CAME TO THE ABBEY WHERE SIR GALAHAD HAD THE WHITE SHIELD AND THERE SIR GAWAINE LEARNED THE WAY TO SEWE AFTER SIR GALAHAD AND SO HE RODE TO THE ABBEY WHERE MELIAS LAY SICK AND THERE SIR MELIAS TOLD SIR GAWAINE OF THE MARVELLOUS ADVENTURES THAT SIR GALAHAD DID
3228-4691-0001 I AM NOT HAPPY THAT I TOOK NOT THE WAY THAT HE WENT FOR AN I MAY MEET WITH HIM I WILL NOT DEPART FROM HIM LIGHTLY FOR ALL MARVELLOUS ADVENTURES SIR GALAHAD ENCHIEVETH SIR SAID ONE OF THE MONKS HE WILL NOT OF YOUR FELLOWSHIP WHY SAID SIR GAWAINE

3228-4691-0003 AND BY THE WAY THEY MET WITH SIR UWAINE LES AVOUTRES AND THERE SIR UWAINE TOLD SIR GAWAINE HOW HE HAD MET WITH NONE ADVENTURE SITH HE DEPARTED FROM THE COURT NOR WE SAID SIR GAWAINE
3228-4691-0004 AND EITHER PROMISED OTHER OF THE THREE KNIGHTS NOT TO DEPART WHILE THEY WERE IN THAT QUEST BUT IF FORTUNE CAUSED IT SO THEY DEPARTED AND RODE BY FORTUNE TILL THAT THEY CAME BY THE CASTLE OF MAIDENS
3228-4691-0005 SITHEN WE BE FLEMED BY ONE KNIGHT FROM THIS CASTLE WE SHALL DESTROY ALL THE KNIGHTS OF KING ARTHUR'S THAT WE MAY OVERCOME FOR THE LOVE OF SIR GALAHAD AND THEREWITH THE SEVEN KNIGHTS SET UPON THE THREE KNIGHTS AND BY FORTUNE SIR GAWAINE SLEW ONE OF THE BRETHREN
3228-4691-0006 AND EACH ONE OF HIS FELLOWS SLEW ANOTHER AND SO SLEW THE REMNANT AND THEN THEY TOOK THE WAY UNDER THE CASTLE AND THERE THEY LOST THE WAY THAT SIR GALAHAD RODE
3228-4691-0007 AND THERE HE FOUND THE GOOD MAN SAYING HIS EVENSONG OF OUR LADY AND THERE SIR GAWAINE ASKED HARBOUR FOR CHARITY AND THE GOOD MAN GRANTED IT HIM GLADLY THEN THE GOOD MAN ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS
3228-4691-0008 NEVER HAD THE SEVEN BRETHREN BEEN SLAIN BY YOU AND YOUR TWO FELLOWS FOR SIR GALAHAD HIMSELF ALONE BEAT THEM ALL SEVEN THE DAY TO FORE BUT HIS LIVING IS SUCH HE SHALL SLAY NO MAN LIGHTLY
3228-4691-0009 ALSO I MAY SAY YOU THE CASTLE OF MAIDENS BETOKENETH THE GOOD SOULS THAT WERE IN PRISON AFORE THE INCARNATION OF JESU CHRIST
3228-4691-0010 AND I MAY LIKEN THE GOOD GALAHAD UNTO THE SON OF THE HIGH FATHER THAT LIGHTED WITHIN A MAID AND BOUGHT ALL THE SOULS OUT OF THRALL SO DID SIR GALAHAD DELIVER ALL THE MAIDENS OUT OF THE WOFUL CASTLE NOW SIR GAWAINE SAID THE GOOD MAN THOU MUST DO PENANCE FOR THY SIN
3228-4691-0011 SIR WHAT PENANCE SHALL I DO SUCH AS I WILL GIVE SAID THE GOOD MAN
3228-4691-0012 AND THEY TWO RODE FOUR DAYS WITHOUT FINDING OF ANY ADVENTURE AND AT THE FIFTH DAY THEY DEPARTED AND EVERYCH HELD AS FELL THEM BY ADVENTURE
3228-4691-0013 AND GALAHAD SMOTE HIM SO AGAIN THAT HE SMOTE DOWN HORSE AND MAN
3228-4691-0014 AND HAD NOT THE SWORD SWERVED SIR PERCIVALE HAD BEEN SLAIN AND WITH THE STROKE HE FELL OUT OF HIS SADDLE THIS JOUSTS WAS DONE TO FORE THE HERMITAGE WHERE A RECLUSE DWELLED AND WHEN SHE SAW SIR GALAHAD RIDE SHE SAID GOD BE WITH THEE BEST KNIGHT OF THE WORLD
3228-4691-0015 WHEN SIR PERCIVALE CAME TO THE RECLUSE SHE KNEW HIM WELL ENOUGH AND SIR LAUNCELOT BOTH
3228-4691-0016 AND AT THE LAST HE CAME TO A STONY CROSS WHICH DEPARTED TWO WAYS IN WASTE LAND
3228-4691-0017 THEN SIR LAUNCELOT LOOKED BY HIM AND SAW AN OLD CHAPEL AND THERE HE WEENED TO HAVE FOUND PEOPLE AND SIR LAUNCELOT TIED HIS HORSE TILL A TREE AND THERE HE DID OFF HIS SHIELD AND HUNG IT UPON A TREE AND THEN WENT TO THE CHAPEL DOOR AND FOUND IT WASTE AND BROKEN AND WITHIN HE FOUND A FAIR ALTAR
3228-4691-0018 FULL RICHLY ARRAYED WITH CLOTH OF CLEAN SILK AND THERE STOOD A FAIR CLEAN CANDLESTICK WHICH BARE SIX GREAT CANDLES AND THE CANDLESTICK WAS OF SILVER AND WHEN SIR LAUNCELOT SAW THIS LIGHT HE HAD GREAT WILL FOR TO ENTER INTO THE CHAPEL
3228-4691-0019 BUT HE COULD FIND NO PLACE WHERE HE MIGHT ENTER THEN WAS HE PASSING HEAVY AND DISMAYED THEN HE RETURNED AND CAME TO HIS HORSE AND DID OFF HIS SADDLE AND BRIDLE AND LET HIM PASTURE AND UNLACED HIS HELM AND UNGIRT HIS SWORD
3228-4691-0020 ALL THIS SIR LAUNCELOT SAW AND BEHELD FOR HE SLEPT NOT VERILY AND HE HEARD HIM SAY O SWEET LORD WHEN SHALL THIS SORROW LEAVE ME AND WHEN SHALL THE HOLY VESSEL COME BY ME WHERETHROUGH I SHALL BE BLESSED FOR I HAVE ENDURED THUS LONG FOR LITTLE TRESPASS
3228-4691-0021 A FULL GREAT WHILE COMPLAINED THE KNIGHT THUS AND ALWAYS SIR LAUNCELOT HEARD IT WITH THAT SIR LAUNCELOT SAW THE CANDLESTICK WITH THE SIX TAPERS COME BEFORE THE CROSS AND HE SAW NOBODY THAT BROUGHT IT
3228-4691-0022 ALSO THERE CAME A TABLE OF SILVER AND THE HOLY VESSEL OF THE SANGREAL WHICH LAUNCELOT HAD SEEN AFORETIME IN KING PESCHEOUR'S HOUSE AND THEREWITH THE SICK KNIGHT SET HIM UP AND HELD UP BOTH HIS HANDS AND SAID FAIR SWEET LORD WHICH IS HERE WITHIN THIS HOLY VESSEL
3228-4691-0023 TAKE HEED UNTO ME THAT I MAY BE WHOLE OF THIS MALADY AND THEREWITH ON HIS HANDS AND ON HIS KNEES HE WENT SO NIGH THAT HE TOUCHED THE HOLY VESSEL AND KISSED IT AND ANON HE WAS WHOLE AND THEN HE SAID LORD GOD I THANK THEE FOR I AM HEALED OF THIS SICKNESS
3228-4691-0024 SO WHEN THE HOLY VESSEL HAD BEEN THERE A GREAT WHILE IT WENT UNTO THE CHAPEL WITH THE CHANDELIER AND THE LIGHT SO THAT LAUNCELOT WIST NOT WHERE IT WAS BECOME FOR HE WAS OVERTAKEN WITH SIN THAT HE HAD NO POWER TO RISE AGAIN THE HOLY VESSEL
3228-4691-0025 WHEREFORE AFTER THAT MANY MEN SAID OF HIM SHAME BUT HE TOOK REPENTANCE AFTER THAT THEN THE SICK KNIGHT DRESSED HIM UP AND KISSED THE CROSS ANON HIS SQUIRE BROUGHT HIM HIS ARMS AND ASKED HIS LORD HOW HE DID
3228-4691-0026 THROUGH THE HOLY VESSEL I AM HEALED BUT I HAVE MARVEL OF THIS SLEEPING KNIGHT THAT HAD NO POWER TO AWAKE WHEN THIS HOLY VESSEL WAS BROUGHT HITHER I DARE RIGHT WELL SAY SAID THE SQUIRE THAT HE DWELLETH IN SOME DEADLY SIN WHEREOF HE WAS NEVER CONFESSED

3228-4691-0029 AND WHEN SIR LAUNCELOT HEARD THIS HE WAS PASSING HEAVY AND WIST NOT WHAT TO DO AND SO DEPARTED SORE WEEPING AND CURSED THE TIME THAT HE WAS BORN FOR THEN HE DEEMED NEVER TO HAVE HAD WORSHIP MORE
3228-4691-0030 AND THEN HE CALLED HIMSELF A VERY WRETCH AND MOST UNHAPPY OF ALL KNIGHTS AND THERE HE SAID MY SIN AND MY WICKEDNESS HAVE BROUGHT ME UNTO GREAT DISHONOUR FOR WHEN I SOUGHT WORLDLY ADVENTURES FOR WORLDLY DESIRES I EVER ENCHIEVED THEM AND HAD THE BETTER IN EVERY PLACE
3228-4691-0031 AND NEVER WAS I DISCOMFIT IN NO QUARREL WERE IT RIGHT OR WRONG AND NOW I TAKE UPON ME THE ADVENTURES OF HOLY THINGS AND NOW I SEE AND UNDERSTAND THAT MINE OLD SIN HINDERETH ME AND SHAMETH ME SO THAT I HAD NO POWER TO STIR NOR SPEAK WHEN THE HOLY BLOOD APPEARED AFORE ME

3228-4691-0037 NOW TAKE HEED IN ALL THE WORLD MEN SHALL NOT FIND ONE KNIGHT TO WHOM OUR LORD HATH GIVEN SO MUCH OF GRACE AS HE HATH GIVEN YOU FOR HE HATH GIVEN YOU FAIRNESS WITH SEEMLINESS HE HATH GIVEN THEE WIT DISCRETION TO KNOW GOOD FROM EVIL
3228-4691-0038 AND NOW OUR LORD WILL SUFFER THEE NO LONGER
3228-4691-0039 FOR WHERE OVERMUCH SIN DWELLETH THERE MAY BE BUT LITTLE SWEETNESS WHEREFORE THOU ART LIKENED TO AN OLD ROTTEN TREE
3228-4691-0040 NOW SHALL I SHEW THEE WHY THOU ART MORE NAKED AND BARER THAN THE FIG TREE IT BEFELL THAT OUR LORD ON PALM SUNDAY PREACHED IN JERUSALEM AND THERE HE FOUND IN THE PEOPLE THAT ALL HARDNESS WAS HARBOURED IN THEM AND THERE HE FOUND IN ALL THE TOWN NOT ONE THAT WOULD HARBOUR HIM
3228-4691-0041 AND THEN HE WENT WITHOUT THE TOWN AND FOUND IN MIDST OF THE WAY A FIG TREE THE WHICH WAS RIGHT FAIR AND WELL GARNISHED OF LEAVES BUT FRUIT HAD IT NONE THEN OUR LORD CURSED THE TREE THAT BARE NO FRUIT THAT BETOKENETH THE FIG TREE UNTO JERUSALEM THAT HAD LEAVES AND NO FRUIT
3228-4691-0042 SO THOU SIR LAUNCELOT WHEN THE HOLY GRAIL WAS BROUGHT AFORE THEE HE FOUND IN THEE NO FRUIT NOR GOOD THOUGHT NOR GOOD WILL AND DEFOULED WITH LECHERY
3228-4691-0043 ALL THAT YOU HAVE SAID IS TRUE AND FROM HENCEFORWARD I CAST ME BY THE GRACE OF GOD NEVER TO BE SO WICKED AS I HAVE BEEN BUT AS TO FOLLOW KNIGHTHOOD AND TO DO FEATS OF ARMS
3228-4691-0044 THEN THE GOOD MAN ENJOINED SIR LAUNCELOT SUCH PENANCE AS HE MIGHT DO AND TO SEWE KNIGHTHOOD AND SO ASSOILED HIM AND PRAYED SIR LAUNCELOT TO ABIDE WITH HIM ALL THAT DAY I WILL WELL SAID SIR LAUNCELOT FOR I HAVE NEITHER HELM NOR HORSE NOR SWORD
