4363-11049-0000 WAITING ON DESTINY THROUGHOUT THE DAY MARIAN KEPT HER ROOM HER INTENTION TO LEAVE THE HOUSE WAS OF COURSE ABANDONED SHE WAS THE PRISONER OF FATE
4363-11049-0001 MISSUS YULE WOULD HAVE TENDED HER WITH UNREMITTING DEVOTION BUT THE GIRL DESIRED TO BE ALONE AT TIMES SHE LAY IN SILENT ANGUISH FREQUENTLY HER TEARS BROKE FORTH
4363-11049-0002 AND SHE SOBBED UNTIL WEARINESS OVERCAME HER IN THE AFTERNOON SHE WROTE A LETTER TO MISTER HOLDEN BEGGING THAT SHE MIGHT BE KEPT CONSTANTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE PROGRESS OF THINGS AT FIVE HER MOTHER BROUGHT TEA
4363-11049-0003 I HAVE TO GO OUT MOTHER SO WE WON'T SPEAK OF IT IT WAS NOT SAFE TO REPLY MISSUS YULE SAT DOWN AND WATCHED THE GIRL RAISE THE CUP TO HER MOUTH WITH TREMBLING HAND
4363-11049-0004 THIS WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO YOU IN THE END MY DARLING THE MOTHER VENTURED TO SAY AT LENGTH
4363-11049-0005 OF COURSE NOT WAS THE REPLY IN A TONE OF SELF PERSUASION MISTER MILVAIN IS SURE TO HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY BEFORE LONG YES
4363-11049-0006 SHE STOPPED AN EMPTY CAB THAT PRESENTLY PASSED HER AND SO DROVE TO THE MILVAINS LODGINGS
4363-11049-0007 AS WAS HER HABIT IT MATTERED VERY LITTLE FOR THE LANDLADY AND HER SERVANTS WERE OF COURSE UNDER NO MISCONCEPTION REGARDING THIS YOUNG LADY'S VISITS JASPER WAS AT HOME AND WORKING
4363-11049-0008 HE HAD BUT TO LOOK AT MARIAN TO SEE THAT SOMETHING WRETCHED HAD BEEN GOING ON AT HER HOME
4363-11049-0009 YOUR FATHER HAS BEEN BEHAVING BRUTALLY HE SAID HOLDING HER HANDS AND GAZING ANXIOUSLY AT HER THERE IS SOMETHING FAR WORSE THAN THAT JASPER WORSE
4363-11049-0010 SHE THREW OFF HER OUTDOOR THINGS THEN TOOK THE FATAL LETTER FROM HER POCKET AND HANDED IT TO HIM JASPER GAVE A WHISTLE OF CONSTERNATION AND LOOKED VACANTLY FROM THE PAPER TO MARIAN'S COUNTENANCE
4363-11049-0011 HOW THE DEUCE COMES THIS ABOUT HE EXCLAIMED WHY WASN'T YOUR UNCLE AWARE OF THE STATE OF THINGS PERHAPS HE WAS HE MAY HAVE KNOWN THAT THE LEGACY WAS A MERE FORM
4363-11049-0012 YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE AFFECTED SO FATHER SAYS
4363-11049-0013 THIS HAS UPSET YOU HORRIBLY I CAN SEE SIT DOWN MARIAN WHEN DID THE LETTER COME THIS MORNING AND YOU HAVE BEEN FRETTING OVER IT ALL DAY BUT COME
4363-11049-0014 YOU MAY GET SOMETHING SUBSTANTIAL OUT OF THE SCOUNDRELS STILL EVEN WHILST HE SPOKE HIS EYES WANDERED ABSENTLY
4363-11049-0015 SHE ASKED MAKING INVOLUNTARY DIVERSION FROM THE CALAMITOUS THEME RUBBISH FOR THE WILL O' THE WISP LISTEN TO THIS PARAGRAPH ABOUT ENGLISH CONCERT AUDIENCES IT WAS AS NECESSARY TO HIM AS TO HER
4363-11049-0016 TO HAVE A RESPITE BEFORE THE GRAVER DISCUSSION BEGAN
4363-11049-0017 SLIPPING FROM ONE TOPIC TO ANOTHER TO HEAR HIM ONE WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS IN HIS ORDINARY MOOD HE LAUGHED AT HIS OWN JOKES AND POINTS THEY'LL HAVE TO PAY ME MORE
4363-11049-0018 WAS THE REMARK WITH WHICH HE CLOSED I ONLY WANTED TO MAKE MYSELF INDISPENSABLE TO THEM AND AT THE END OF THIS YEAR I SHALL FEEL PRETTY SURE OF THAT
4363-11049-0019 AND YOU MAY HOPE FOR MUCH MORE THAN THAT MAYN'T YOU BEFORE LONG OH I SHALL TRANSFER MYSELF TO A BETTER PAPER PRESENTLY IT SEEMS TO ME I MUST BE STIRRING TO SOME PURPOSE
4363-11049-0020 FATHER SAID I HAD BETTER SIGN THAT HARRINGTON ARTICLE MYSELF IF I DO THAT I SHALL HAVE A RIGHT TO THE MONEY I THINK IT WILL AT LEAST BE EIGHT GUINEAS AND WHY SHOULDN'T I GO ON WRITING FOR MYSELF FOR US
4363-11049-0021 FIRST OF ALL WHAT ABOUT MY LETTER TO YOUR FATHER WE ARE FORGETTING ALL ABOUT IT HE REFUSED TO ANSWER MARIAN AVOIDED CLOSER DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED
4363-11049-0022 THAT SHE WAS UNWILLING TO PAIN HER LOVER BY MAKING DISPLAY OF ALL SHE HAD UNDERGONE OH HE REFUSED TO REPLY SURELY THAT IS EXTREME BEHAVIOUR WHAT SHE DREADED SEEMED TO BE COMING TO PASS
4363-11049-0023 JASPER STOOD RATHER STIFFLY AND THREW HIS HEAD BACK YOU KNOW THE REASON DEAR THAT PREJUDICE HAS ENTERED INTO HIS VERY LIFE IT IS NOT YOU HE DISLIKES THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE HE THINKS OF YOU
4363-11049-0024 ONLY AS HE WOULD OF ANYONE CONNECTED WITH MISTER FADGE WELL WELL IT ISN'T A MATTER OF MUCH MOMENT BUT WHAT I HAVE IN MIND IS THIS WILL IT BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU WHILST LIVING AT HOME
4363-11049-0025 WHEN I AM YOUR WIFE I MAY BE ABLE TO HELP I COULD EARN THIRTY OR FORTY POUNDS A YEAR I THINK THAT WOULD PAY THE RENT OF A SMALL HOUSE SHE SPOKE WITH SHAKEN VOICE
4363-11049-0026 HER EYES FIXED UPON HIS FACE BUT MY DEAR MARIAN
4363-11049-0027 NO I ONLY MEANT SHE FALTERED AND HER TONGUE BECAME SILENT AS HER HEART SANK IT SIMPLY MEANS PURSUED JASPER
4363-11049-0028 SEATING HIMSELF AND CROSSING HIS LEGS THAT I MUST MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO IMPROVE MY POSITION YOU KNOW THAT MY FAITH IN MYSELF IS NOT SMALL THERE'S NO KNOWING WHAT I MIGHT DO IF I USED EVERY EFFORT
4363-11049-0029 CAN YOU PROMISE TO KEEP A LITTLE LOVE FOR ME ALL THAT TIME HE ASKED WITH A CONSTRAINED SMILE YOU KNOW ME TOO WELL TO FEAR
4363-11049-0030 I THOUGHT YOU SEEMED A LITTLE DOUBTFUL HIS TONE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER THAT WHICH MAKES BANTER PLEASANT BETWEEN LOVERS MARIAN LOOKED AT HIM FEARFULLY
4363-11049-0031 WAS IT POSSIBLE FOR HIM IN TRUTH SO TO MISUNDERSTAND HER HE HAD NEVER SATISFIED HER HEART'S DESIRE OF INFINITE LOVE SHE NEVER SPOKE WITH HIM
4363-11049-0032 BUT SHE WAS OPPRESSED WITH THE SUSPICION THAT HIS LOVE WAS NOT AS GREAT AS HERS AND WORSE STILL THAT HE DID NOT WHOLLY COMPREHEND THE SELF SURRENDER WHICH SHE STROVE TO MAKE PLAIN IN EVERY WORD
4363-11049-0033 IT MUSTN'T BE YEARS THAT'S VERY CERTAIN I THINK IT PREPOSTEROUS FOR A MAN TO HOLD A WOMAN BOUND IN THAT HOPELESS WAY
4363-11049-0034 IS LOVE DEPENDENT ON FIXED ENGAGEMENTS DO YOU FEEL THAT IF WE AGREED TO PART YOUR LOVE WOULD BE AT ONCE A THING OF THE PAST WHY NO OF COURSE NOT
4363-11049-0035 THAT SHE DID NOT ENTIRELY TRUST HIM AND VIEWED HIS CHARACTER AS SOMETHING LESS THAN NOBLE VERY SELDOM INDEED IS A WOMAN FREE FROM SUCH DOUBTS
4363-11049-0036 ALL THE PRAISES HE SPEAKS OF HIS BELOVED PASSION IS COMPATIBLE WITH A GREAT MANY OF THESE IMPERFECTIONS OF INTELLECTUAL ESTEEM TO SEE MORE CLEARLY INTO JASPER'S PERSONALITY WAS FOR MARIAN TO SUFFER THE MORE INTOLERABLE DREAD
4363-11049-0037 SHE WENT TO HIS SIDE HER HEART ACHED BECAUSE IN HER GREAT MISERY HE HAD NOT FONDLED HER AND INTOXICATED HER SENSES WITH LOVING WORDS
4363-11049-0038 HOW CAN I MAKE YOU FEEL HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU SHE MURMURED YOU MUSTN'T BE SO LITERAL DEAREST WOMEN ARE SO DESPERATELY MATTER OF FACT
4363-11049-0039 IT COMES OUT EVEN IN THEIR LOVE TALK MARIAN WAS NOT WITHOUT PERCEPTION OF THE IRONY OF SUCH AN OPINION ON JASPER'S LIPS I AM CONTENT FOR YOU TO THINK SO SHE SAID
