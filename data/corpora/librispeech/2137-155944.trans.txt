2137-155944-0000 NOT MORE THAN ONE OF US WOULD GET AWAY AND THEN THE BARON TOLD TALES BY THE SCORE ABOUT THE GREEN KNIGHT'S QUENCHLESS THIRST FOR GORE AND KEPT REPEATING THAT NO MAGIC CHARM WAS PROOF AGAINST THE PROWESS OF HIS ARM
2137-155944-0001 AT HIS FIRST BLOW EACH VAIN DEFENSE MUST FALL FOR HE WAS ARCH MAGICIAN OVER ALL AND AS FROM TALE TO TALE THE BARON RAN SIR GAWAYNE HAD HE BEEN ANOTHER MAN WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE FELT HIS HEART'S BLOOD CURDLE
2137-155944-0002 DESPITE HIS SECRET WEARING OF THE GIRDLE BUT WHEN THE BARON FINALLY SUGGESTED ABANDONING THE VENTURE AND PROTESTED THAT THE WHOLE MONSTROUS BUSINESS WAS ABSURD SIR GAWAYNE SIMPLY SAID I GAVE MY WORD
2137-155944-0003 AND WHEN THE BARON SAW HE WOULD NOT BEND HE SEEMED TO LOSE ALL PATIENCE WELL MY FRIEND I'LL GO NO FURTHER WITH YOU ON YOUR HEAD SHALL BE YOUR OWN MAD BLOOD WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
2137-155944-0004 YONDER YOUR TWO ROADS FORK PAUSE THERE I PRAY AND PONDER WELL BEFORE YOU CHOOSE YOUR WAY ONE TAKES THE HILLS ONE WINDS ALONG THE WAVE TO CAMELOT THIS
2137-155944-0005 AND VANISHED WHERE THE ROAD TURNED GAWAYNE HEARD
2137-155944-0006 FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF HIS MARTYRDOM AND NOW FROM JUST BEYOND A JUTTING HILL CAME HIDEOUS SOUNDS AS OF A GIANT MILL THAT HISSES ROARS AND SPUTTERS CLICKS AND CLACKS
2137-155944-0007 IT WAS THE GREEN KNIGHT SHARPENING HIS AXE AND GAWAYNE COMING PAST THE CORNER FOUND HIM WITH GHASTLY MOULDERING SKULLS AND BONES STREWN ROUND HIM IN JOYOUS FURY URGING THE KEEN STEEL
2137-155944-0008 AGAINST THE SURFACE OF HIS GRINDING WHEEL THE PLACE WAS A WILD HOLLOW CIRCLED ROUND WITH BARREN HILLS AND ON THE BOTTOM GROUND STOOD THE GREEN CHAPEL MOSS GROWN SOLITARY
2137-155944-0009 IN SOOTH IT SEEMED THE DEVIL'S MORTUARY THE GREEN KNIGHT'S BACK WAS TURNED AND HE STIRRED NOT TILL GAWAYNE HAILED HIM SHARPLY THEN HE SHOT ONE GLANCE AS WHEN O'ERHEAD A LIVING WIRE
2137-155944-0010 STARTLES THE NIGHT WITH FLASHES OF GREEN FIRE THEN HURRIED FORWARD BLAND AS BLAND COULD BE AND GREETED GAWAYNE WITH GREEN COURTESY DEAR SIR I ASK A THOUSAND PARDONS PRAY

2137-155944-0015 HE DID SO AND THE GREEN KNIGHT SWUNG AGAIN HIS AXE AND WHIRLED IT ROUND HIS HEAD AND THEN PAUSING A SECOND TIME SAID VERY GOOD YOU'RE HOLDING QUITE STILL NOW I KNEW YOU WOULD
2137-155944-0016 SIR GAWAYNE'S NECK HE FELT THE HOT BLOOD FLOW AND SAW RED DROPS THAT SANK DEEP IN THE SNOW AND THEN HE JUMPED UP FACED HIS FOE AND CRIED ENOUGH YOU OWED ME ONE BLOW THOUGH I DIED
2137-155944-0017 AND WHEN I SWUNG MY WEAPON FOR THE THIRD AND LAST TIME THEN I MADE THE RED BLOOD SPIRT FOR THAT GREEN GIRDLE UNDERNEATH YOUR SHIRT YOU PLAYED ME FALSE MY FRIEND AND GAWAYNE KNELT
2137-155944-0018 ONCE MORE AND CASTING OFF THE MAGIC BELT IN BITTER BROKEN WORDS CONFESSED HIS SHAME AND BEGGED THE GREEN KNIGHT TO AVENGE THE NAME OF INJURED KNIGHTHOOD AND WITH ONE LAST BLOW TO END HIS GUILTY LIFE

2137-155944-0022 THE WARM RED BLOOD RUSHED TO SIR GAWAYNE'S FACE HE CAUGHT HIS BREATH AND IN HIS EAGER EYES THERE SHONE A SUDDEN FLASH OF DARK SURMISE AND THEN HE STOOD A LONG WHILE PONDERING
2137-155944-0023 BUT IN HIS BREAST HIS HEART BEGAN TO SING THE OLD OLD MUSIC WHOSE STILL ECHOES ROLL FOREVER VOICELESS THROUGH THE LISTENING SOUL HE SAID FAREWELL TO HIS GOOD FAIRY FRIEND AS IN A DREAM
2137-155944-0024 WHERE REAL AND UNREAL BLEND IN PHANTOM UNISON AND WITH THE LIGHT OF LOVE TO LEAD HIM HOME RODE THROUGH THE NIGHT BESIDE THE TRANQUIL MURMURS OF THE MERE AND THROUGH THE SILENCE OF THE PASSING YEAR
2137-155944-0025 AND EARTH AND SEA AND STARLIT SKY TOOK PART IN THE STILL EXALTATION OF HIS HEART WHILE ALL BUT LOVE AND WONDER WAS FORGOT UNTIL HE CAME TO HIGH TOWERED CAMELOT
2137-155944-0026 TO CAMELOT HE CAME AND THERE HE FOUND THE GOOD KING ARTHUR AND HIS TABLE ROUND AWAITING HIS RETURN IN ANXIOUS DOUBT BUT ERE HE PASSED THE GATES A MIGHTY SHOUT
2137-155944-0027 CHIMING IN THE TOPMOST TOWER PEALED SALUTATION TO THE JOYOUS HOUR AS GAWAYNE RIDING THROUGH THE CULLIS PORT FACED THE GLAD THRONG THAT FILLED THE PALACE COURT AND WITH THIS TRIBUTE PAID TO KNIGHTLY GLORY
