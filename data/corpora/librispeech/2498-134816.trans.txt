2498-134816-0027 THE FLEMING REMAINED UTTERLY STUPID AS HE HIMSELF SAID SOME TIME AFTERWARDS THE MAYOR HAD BEEN GONE TWO OR THREE MINUTES WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN IT WAS THE MAYOR ONCE MORE
2498-134816-0028 HE STILL WORE THE SAME IMPASSIVE AND PREOCCUPIED AIR MONSIEUR SCAUFFLAIRE SAID HE

2498-134816-0031 HERE IT IS M MADELEINE LAID A BANK BILL ON THE TABLE THEN LEFT THE ROOM AND THIS TIME HE DID NOT RETURN MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE EXPERIENCED A FRIGHTFUL REGRET THAT HE HAD NOT SAID A THOUSAND FRANCS
2498-134816-0032 THE FLEMING CALLED HIS WIFE AND RELATED THE AFFAIR TO HER WHERE THE DEVIL COULD MONSIEUR LE MAIRE BE GOING
2498-134816-0033 SAID THE WIFE I DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID THE HUSBAND M MADELEINE HAD FORGOTTEN THE PAPER WITH THE FIGURES ON IT AND IT LAY ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE THE FLEMING PICKED IT UP AND STUDIED IT FIVE SIX
2498-134816-0034 EIGHT AND A HALF THAT MUST DESIGNATE THE POSTING RELAYS HE TURNED TO HIS WIFE I HAVE FOUND OUT WHAT IT IS FIVE LEAGUES FROM HERE TO HESDIN
2498-134816-0035 MEANWHILE M MADELEINE HAD RETURNED HOME HE HAD TAKEN THE LONGEST WAY TO RETURN FROM MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE'S AS THOUGH THE PARSONAGE DOOR HAD BEEN A TEMPTATION FOR HIM
2498-134816-0036 HE ASCENDED TO HIS ROOM AND THERE HE SHUT HIMSELF UP WHICH WAS A VERY SIMPLE ACT
2498-134816-0037 NEVERTHELESS THE PORTRESS OF THE FACTORY WHO WAS AT THE SAME TIME M MADELEINE'S ONLY SERVANT NOTICED THAT THE LATTER'S LIGHT WAS EXTINGUISHED AT HALF PAST EIGHT AND SHE MENTIONED IT TO THE CASHIER WHEN HE CAME HOME ADDING
2498-134816-0038 IS MONSIEUR LE MAIRE ILL I THOUGHT HE HAD A RATHER SINGULAR AIR THIS CASHIER OCCUPIED A ROOM SITUATED DIRECTLY UNDER M MADELEINE'S CHAMBER HE PAID NO HEED TO THE PORTRESS'S WORDS BUT WENT TO BED AND TO SLEEP
2498-134816-0039 IN HIS SLEEP HE HAD HEARD A NOISE ABOVE HIS HEAD HE LISTENED IT WAS A FOOTSTEP PACING BACK AND FORTH AS THOUGH SOME ONE WERE WALKING IN THE ROOM ABOVE HIM HE LISTENED MORE ATTENTIVELY
2498-134816-0040 AND RECOGNIZED M MADELEINE'S STEP THIS STRUCK HIM AS STRANGE USUALLY THERE WAS NO NOISE IN M MADELEINE'S CHAMBER UNTIL HE ROSE IN THE MORNING A MOMENT LATER THE CASHIER HEARD A NOISE WHICH RESEMBLED THAT OF A CUPBOARD BEING OPENED
2498-134816-0041 AND THEN SHUT AGAIN THEN A PIECE OF FURNITURE WAS DISARRANGED THEN A PAUSE ENSUED THEN THE STEP BEGAN AGAIN THE CASHIER SAT UP IN BED QUITE AWAKE NOW AND STARING AND THROUGH HIS WINDOW PANES HE SAW THE REDDISH GLEAM
2498-134816-0042 OF A LIGHTED WINDOW REFLECTED ON THE OPPOSITE WALL FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE RAYS IT COULD ONLY COME FROM THE WINDOW OF M MADELEINE'S CHAMBER THE REFLECTION WAVERED AS THOUGH IT CAME RATHER FROM A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN LIGHTED THAN FROM A CANDLE
2498-134816-0043 THE SHADOW OF THE WINDOW FRAME WAS NOT SHOWN WHICH INDICATED THAT THE WINDOW WAS WIDE OPEN THE FACT THAT THIS WINDOW WAS OPEN IN SUCH COLD WEATHER WAS SURPRISING THE CASHIER FELL ASLEEP AGAIN
2498-134816-0044 AN HOUR OR TWO LATER HE WAKED AGAIN THE SAME STEP WAS STILL PASSING SLOWLY AND REGULARLY BACK AND FORTH OVERHEAD THE REFLECTION WAS STILL VISIBLE ON THE WALL BUT NOW IT WAS PALE AND PEACEFUL LIKE THE REFLECTION OF A LAMP
2498-134816-0045 OR OF A CANDLE THE WINDOW WAS STILL OPEN
