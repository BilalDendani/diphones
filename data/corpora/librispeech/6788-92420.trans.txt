6788-92420-0000 HALF BLIND LOVE OF RIGHT AND HONEST INDIGNATION AT THE SORT OF WRONG WHICH IT CAN DISCERN TO BE FOUND IN THE CLASS FROM WHICH IT EMANATES THAT CLASS IS A LARGE ONE IN OUR COUNTRY VILLAGES
6788-92420-0001 AND THESE BOOKS REFLECT ITS THOUGHTS AND MANNERS AS HALF PENNY BALLADS DO THE LIFE OF THE STREETS OF LONDON THE BALLADS ARE NOT MORE TRUE TO THE FACTS BUT THEY GIVE US IN A COARSER FORM
6788-92420-0002 FAR MORE OF THE SPIRIT THAN WE GET FROM THE SAME FACTS REFLECTED IN THE INTELLECT OF A DICKENS FOR INSTANCE OR OF ANY WRITER FAR ENOUGH ABOVE THE SCENE TO BE PROPERLY ITS ARTIST SO IN THIS BOOK WE FIND WHAT COOPER
6788-92420-0003 MISS SEDGWICK AND MISSUS KIRKLAND MIGHT SEE AS THE WRITER DID BUT COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IN ENOUGH TO SPEAK OF IT WITH SUCH FIDELITY IT IS A CURRENT SUPERSTITION THAT COUNTRY PEOPLE ARE MORE PURE AND HEALTHY IN MIND AND BODY
6788-92420-0004 THAN THOSE WHO LIVE IN CITIES IT MAY BE SO IN COUNTRIES OF OLD ESTABLISHED HABITS WHERE A GENUINE PEASANTRY HAVE INHERITED SOME OF THE PRACTICAL WISDOM AND LOYALTY OF THE PAST WITH MOST OF ITS ERRORS
6788-92420-0005 WE HAVE OUR DOUBTS THOUGH FROM THE STAMP UPON LITERATURE ALWAYS THE NEAREST EVIDENCE OF TRUTH WE CAN GET WHETHER EVEN THERE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TOWN AND COUNTRY LIFE IS AS MUCH IN FAVOR OF THE LATTER AS IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED
6788-92420-0006 BUT IN OUR LAND WHERE THE COUNTRY IS AT PRESENT FILLED WITH A MIXED POPULATION WHO COME SEEKING TO BE PURIFIED BY A BETTER LIFE AND CULTURE FROM ALL THE ILLS AND DISEASES OF THE WORST FORMS OF CIVILIZATION
6788-92420-0007 THINGS OFTEN LOOK WORSE THAN IN THE CITY PERHAPS BECAUSE MEN HAVE MORE TIME AND ROOM TO LET THEIR FAULTS GROW AND OFFEND THE LIGHT OF DAY THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS AND NOT A FEW
6788-92420-0008 BUT IN A VERY GREAT PROPORTION OF COUNTRY VILLAGES THE HABITS OF THE PEOPLE AS TO FOOD AIR AND EVEN EXERCISE ARE IGNORANT AND UNHEALTHY TO THE LAST DEGREE THEIR WANT OF ALL PURE FAITH
6788-92420-0009 BOTH AS TO WITHDRAWAL FROM BAD ASSOCIATIONS AND NEARNESS TO GOOD WE HEARD INEVITABLY FROM DOMESTICS WORK PEOPLE AND SCHOOL CHILDREN MORE ILL OF HUMAN NATURE THAN WE COULD POSSIBLY SIFT
6788-92420-0010 WERE WE TO ELECT SUCH A TASK FROM ALL THE NEWSPAPERS OF THIS CITY IN THE SAME SPACE OF TIME WE BELIEVE THE AMOUNT OF ILL CIRCULATED BY MEANS OF ANONYMOUS LETTERS AS DESCRIBED IN THIS BOOK
6788-92420-0011 TO BE AS GREAT AS CAN BE IMPORTED IN ALL THE FRENCH NOVELS AND THAT IS A BOLD WORD WE KNOW OURSELVES OF TWO OR THREE CASES OF MORBID WICKEDNESS DISPLAYED BY MEANS OF ANONYMOUS LETTERS
6788-92420-0012 THAT MAY VIE WITH WHAT PUZZLED THE BEST WITS OF FRANCE IN A FAMOUS LAW SUIT NOT LONG SINCE IT IS TRUE THERE IS TO BALANCE ALL THIS A HEALTHY REBOUND
6788-92420-0013 A SURPRISE AND A SHAME AND THERE ARE HEARTILY GOOD PEOPLE SUCH AS ARE DESCRIBED IN THIS BOOK
6788-92420-0014 AND CANNOT BE BENT DOWNWARD NOR ASIDE BUT THEN THE REVERSE OF THE PICTURE IS OF A BLACKNESS THAT WOULD APPALL ONE WHO CAME TO IT WITH ANY IDYLLIC IDEAS OF THE PURITY AND PEACEFUL LOVELINESS OF AGRICULTURAL LIFE
6788-92420-0015 BUT WHAT DOES THIS PROVE ONLY THE NEED OF A DISSEMINATION OF ALL THAT IS BEST INTELLECTUALLY AND MORALLY THROUGH THE WHOLE PEOPLE
6788-92420-0016 BUT THE SERVICE OF GOD AND THE DESTINY OF MAN OUR PEOPLE REQUIRE A THOROUGHLY DIFFUSED INTELLECTUAL LIFE A RELIGIOUS AIM SUCH AS NO PEOPLE AT LARGE EVER POSSESSED BEFORE ELSE THEY MUST SINK TILL THEY BECOME DREGS
6788-92420-0017 IS ONE CALLED METALLEK IT MAY BE IN CIRCULATION IN THIS CITY BUT WE BOUGHT IT IN A COUNTRY NOOK AND FROM A PEDLAR AND IT SEEMED TO BELONG TO THE COUNTRY
6788-92420-0018 HAD WE MET WITH IT IN ANY OTHER WAY IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN TO THROW IT ASIDE AGAIN DIRECTLY FOR THE AUTHOR DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO WRITE ENGLISH AND THE FIRST CHAPTERS GIVE NO IDEA OF HIS POWER OF APPREHENDING THE POETRY OF LIFE
6788-92420-0019 BUT HAPPENING TO READ ON WE BECAME FIXED AND CHARMED AND HAVE RETAINED FROM ITS PERUSAL THE SWEETEST PICTURE OF LIFE LIVED IN THIS LAND EVER AFFORDED US OUT OF THE PALE OF PERSONAL OBSERVATION THAT SUCH THINGS ARE
6788-92420-0020 BUT THE WRITERS OF BOOKS RARELY SEEM TO HAVE SEEN THEM RARELY TO HAVE WALKED ALONE IN AN UNTRODDEN PATH LONG ENOUGH TO HOLD COMMUNE WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE SCENE
6788-92420-0021 ONLY TO SHOOT THE POOR ANIMALS THAT WERE HAPPY THERE WINNING FROM THE PURE ATMOSPHERE LITTLE BENEFIT EXCEPT TO GOOD APPETITE SLEEPING AT NIGHT IN THE DIRTY HOVELS
6788-92420-0022 WITH PEOPLE WHO BURROW IN THEM TO LEAD A LIFE BUT LITTLE ABOVE THAT OF THE SQUIRRELS END FOXES THERE IS THROUGHOUT THAT AIR OF ROOM ENOUGH AND FREE IF LOW FORMS OF HUMAN NATURE
6788-92420-0023 WHICH AT SUCH TIMES MAKES BEARABLE ALL THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE SO REPULSIVE BUT WHEN WE COME TO THE GIRL WHO IS THE PRESIDING DEITY OR RATHER THE TUTELARY ANGEL OF THE SCENE HOW ARE ALL DISCORDS HARMONIZED
6788-92420-0024 HOW ALL ITS LATENT MUSIC POURED FORTH IT IS A PORTRAIT FROM THE LIFE IT HAS THE MYSTIC CHARM OF FULFILLED REALITY HOW FAR BEYOND THE FAIREST IDEALS EVER BORN OF THOUGHT
6788-92420-0025 SHARES WHILE SHE SUBLIMES ITS NATURE SHE PLAYS ROUND THE MOST VULGAR AND RUDE BEINGS GENTLE AND CARESSING YET UNSULLIED
6788-92420-0026 IN HER WILDNESS THERE IS NOTHING COLD OR SAVAGE HER ELEVATION IS SOFT AND WARM NEVER HAVE WE SEEN NATURAL RELIGION MORE BEAUTIFULLY EXPRESSED NEVER SO WELL DISCERNED THE INFLUENCE OF THE NATURAL NUN
6788-92420-0027 HER FEARLESSNESS HER GAY AND SWEET ENJOYMENT OF NATURE HER INTERCOURSE WITH THE OLD PEOPLE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD HER SISTERLY CONDUCT TOWARDS HER SUITORS ALL SEEM PAINTED FROM THE LIFE
6788-92420-0028 BUT THE DEATH BED SCENE SEEMS BORROWED FROM SOME SERMON AND IS NOT IN HARMONY WITH THE REST IN THIS CONNECTION WE MUST TRY TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE STUPIDITY OF AN EARLIER NOTICE OF THE NOVEL CALLED
6788-92420-0029 AND DID NO JUSTICE TO A WORK FULL OF GENIUS PROFOUND IN ITS MEANING AND OF ADMIRABLE FIDELITY TO NATURE IN ITS DETAILS SINCE THEN WE HAVE REALLY READ IT AND APPRECIATED THE SIGHT AND REPRESENTATION OF SOUL REALITIES
6788-92420-0030 AND WE HAVE LAMENTED THE LONG DELAY OF SO TRUE A PLEASURE A FINE CRITIC SAID THIS IS A YANKEE NOVEL OR RATHER LET IT BE CALLED THE YANKEE NOVEL
6788-92420-0031 AS NOWHERE ELSE ARE THE THOUGHT AND DIALECT OF OUR VILLAGES REALLY REPRESENTED ANOTHER DISCOVERED THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN MAINE BY THE PERFECTION WITH WHICH PECULIAR FEATURES OF SCENERY THERE ARE DESCRIBED
6788-92420-0032 A MATURE READER ONE OF THE MOST SPIRITUALIZED AND HARMONIOUS MINDS WE HAVE EVER MET ADMIRES THE DEPTH AND FULNESS IN WHICH THE WORKINGS OF THE SPIRIT THROUGH THE MAIDEN'S LIFE ARE SEEN BY THE AUTHOR AND SHOWN TO US
6788-92420-0033 BUT LAMENTS THE GREAT APPARATUS WITH WHICH THE CONSUMMATION OF THE WHOLE IS BROUGHT ABOUT AND THE FORMATION OF A NEW CHURCH AND STATE BEFORE THE TIME IS YET RIPE
6788-92420-0034 BUT ALL THESE VOICES AMONG THOSE MOST WORTHY TO BE HEARD FIND IN THE BOOK A REAL PRESENCE AND DRAW FROM IT AUSPICIOUS OMENS THAT AN AMERICAN LITERATURE IS POSSIBLE EVEN IN OUR DAY
6788-92420-0035 BECAUSE THERE ARE ALREADY IN THE MIND HERE EXISTENT DEVELOPMENTS WORTHY TO SEE THE LIGHT GOLD FISHES AMID THE MOSS IN THE STILL WATERS
6788-92420-0036 FOR OURSELVES WE HAVE BEEN MOST CHARMED WITH THE WAY THE REAL AND IDEAL ARE MADE TO WEAVE AND SHOOT RAYS THROUGH ONE ANOTHER IN WHICH MARGARET BESTOWS ON EXTERNAL NATURE WHAT SHE RECEIVES THROUGH BOOKS
6788-92420-0037 AND WINS BACK LIKE GIFTS IN TURN TILL THE POND AND THE MYTHOLOGY ARE ALTERNATE SECTIONS OF THE SAME CHAPTER WE DELIGHT IN THE TEACHINGS SHE RECEIVES THROUGH CHILION AND HIS VIOLIN TILL ON THE GRAVE OF ONE WHO TRIED TO LOVE HIS FELLOW MEN
6788-92420-0038 WE HAVE MUCH MORE TO THINK AND TO SAY OF THE BOOK AS A WHOLE AND IN PARTS AND SHOULD THE MOOD AND SUMMER LEISURE EVER PERMIT A FAMILIAR AND INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH IT WE TRUST THEY WILL BE BOTH THOUGHT AND SAID
6788-92420-0039 FOR THE PRESENT WE WILL ONLY ADD THAT IT EXHIBITS THE SAME STATE OF THINGS AND STRIVES TO POINT OUT SUCH REMEDIES AS WE HAVE HINTED AT IN SPEAKING OF THE LITTLE BOOK WHICH HEADS THIS NOTICE ITSELF A RUDE CHARCOAL SKETCH
