6115-58776-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN GLACIAL AND PREGLACIAL LAKES AND RIVERS SINCE THE RECESSION OF THE ICE PREGLACIAL LAKES HAVE BEEN FILLED UP AND ARE NOW DRY LAND AND RIVER BEDS HAVE BEEN CHANGED SO THAT NEW CHANNELS HAVE BEEN CUT
6115-58776-0001 AND NEW LAKES HAVE BEEN FORMED EVEN THE IMAGINATION THAT WONDERFUL ARCHITECT WITH ALL ITS TENDENCIES TO EXAGGERATION PALLS IN ITS ATTEMPT TO GIVE EXPRESSION IN MEASURED QUANTITIES TO THE MIGHTY POWER EXERTED BY THE GREAT GLACIER
6115-58776-0002 OR COMBINATION OF GLACIERS THAT EXISTED IN COMPARATIVELY RECENT TIMES
6115-58776-0003 AT THIS POINT ARE STRIKING EVIDENCES OF THE WORK OF THE ICE AGE BEFORE THE GLACIAL PERIOD THE WISCONSIN RIVER MADE A DETOUR SOME MILES WEST OF ITS PRESENT CHANNEL THROUGH THE HIGH HILLS IN THE REGION OF BARABOO
6115-58776-0004 ARE VERY PRECIPITOUS AND ARE FORMED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF ROCKS THE RIVER AT THAT POINT PASSED BETWEEN TWO OF THESE HILLS WHEN THE ICE FLOWED DOWN IT SURROUNDED THESE HILLS YET DID NOT SWEEP OVER THEIR TOPS BUT LEFT GREAT PILES OF GLACIAL DRIFT
6115-58776-0005 THIS LAKE RECEDES MANY FEET DURING THE SUMMER BUT IT IS AGAIN FILLED UP BY THE RAINS AND SNOWS OF WINTER THERE IS NO CONSIDERABLE STREAM EITHER FLOWING INTO OR OUT FROM IT IT IS A LAKE FORMED BY THE GLACIERS
6115-58776-0006 THERE ARE HUNDREDS AND PERHAPS THOUSANDS OF LAKES
6115-58776-0007 THESE SMALLER INLAND LAKES
6115-58776-0008 SOUTHERN WISCONSIN AND MINNESOTA ARE DUE ALMOST ENTIRELY TO THE GREAT DEPOSITS OF GLACIAL DRIFT THAT HAVE BEEN TRANSPORTED WITH THE ICE WHEREVER THESE KETTLE HOLES ARE FOUND LARGE BODIES OF ICE HAVE BECOME ANCHORED
6115-58776-0009 WHILE THE ICE BEHIND IT HAS CARRIED THE DRIFT UNTIL IT IS COVERED OVER AND PILED UP AT THE SIDES WHEN THESE ICE MOUNTAINS MELTED AWAY DEPRESSIONS WERE LEFT WHICH IN SOME CASES HAVE RESULTED IN LAKES AND IN OTHERS SIMPLY DRY KETTLE HOLES
6115-58776-0010 THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN HINTED AT IN A FORMER CHAPTER BUT WE GIVE IT HERE AS ONE OF THE KINDS OF LAKES FORMED DURING THE GLACIAL PERIOD THEY ARE FOUND EVERYWHERE THAT GLACIAL ACTION HAS PREVAILED THEY ARE FOUND IN GREAT ABUNDANCE IN SOME PARTS OF NEW ENGLAND
6115-58776-0011 ON THE MARGIN OF THE TERMINAL MORAINE THESE LAKES HOWEVER ARE COMPARATIVELY INSIGNIFICANT AS COMPARED WITH THE GREAT INLAND SEAS LIKE LAKE SUPERIOR AND LAKE MICHIGAN THAT UNDOUBTEDLY OWE THEIR ORIGIN LARGELY TO THE ICE AGE
6115-58776-0012 IN ORDER HOWEVER THAT WE MAY UNDERSTAND MORE FULLY THE FORMATION OF THESE GREATER LAKES IT WILL BE NECESSARY FOR US TO GO BACK AND EXAMINE THE CONDITIONS THAT SEEM TO HAVE EXISTED BEFORE THE GLACIAL PERIOD
6115-58776-0013 THIS IS EVIDENCED IN VERY MANY WAYS BY SOUNDING THE DEPTHS OF OLD RIVER BEDS NOW FILLED WITH GLACIAL DEBRIS THE OLD BEDS SHOW UNMISTAKABLE EVIDENCES OF HAVING BEEN WORN DOWN TO THEIR PRESENT LEVEL BY THE ACTION OF RUNNING WATER
6115-58776-0014 THEY ALSO PROVE TO BE MANY FEET BELOW THE PRESENT SEA LEVEL THIS FACT SEEMS TO BE SUFFICIENT TO PROVE THE THEORY OF A HIGHER ELEVATION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT IN PREGLACIAL TIMES IT SHOULD BE SAID HERE THAT UNDOUBTEDLY THE CONSTANT FILLING UP OF THE OCEAN
6115-58776-0015 WITH THE DRIFT CARRIED DOWN BY THE RIVERS HAS SOMEWHAT RAISED ITS LEVEL BUT HARDLY TO THE EXTENT INDICATED BY THE OLD RIVER BEDS THE QUESTION NATURALLY ARISES WHERE DID ALL THE DIRT COME FROM TO FILL UP THESE GREAT RIVER BEDS
6115-58776-0016 DOCTOR WRIGHT ESTIMATES THAT THERE IS NOT LESS THAN ONE MILLION SQUARE MILES OF TERRITORY IN NORTH AMERICA COVERED WITH GLACIAL DEBRIS TO AN AVERAGE DEPTH OF FIFTY FEET OF COURSE THE DEPTH VARIES IN DIFFERENT PLACES FROM A FEW INCHES TO SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET
6115-58776-0017 OF THE CARRYING POWER OF THESE GREAT GLACIERS WE WILL SPEAK MORE FULLY IN A FUTURE CHAPTER IN PREGLACIAL TIMES THE WATERSHED OF THE MISSISSIPPI AND OF THE GREAT RIVERS EAST OF THE ALLEGHANY MOUNTAINS THE SUSQUEHANNA AND HUDSON
6115-58776-0018 EXTENDED PROBABLY FARTHER NORTH THAN IT DOES TO DAY THE LARGER PORTION OF THE DRAINAGE AREA THAT NOW FINDS AN OUTLET THROUGH THE RIVER SAINT LAWRENCE AT ONE TIME UNDOUBTEDLY DRAINED OFF THROUGH THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
6115-58776-0019 THAT PRIOR TO THE GLACIAL PERIOD A RIVER FLOWED DOWN THROUGH LAKE SUPERIOR WHICH CONNECTED WITH LAKE MICHIGAN AT A POINT NEAR ITS PRESENT OUTLET
6115-58776-0020 THE CHANNEL OF THE RIVER PASSING DOWN THROUGH WHAT IS NOW THE BOTTOM OF LAKE MICHIGAN WHICH HAD AN OUTLET AT THE HEAD OF THE LAKE NEAR CHICAGO AND FLOWED OFF INTO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER ALL OF THE LAKE BOTTOMS OF THIS GREAT CHAIN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LAKE ERIE
6115-58776-0021 ARE NOW BELOW SEA LEVEL THE REASON FOR THIS EXCEPTION WILL APPEAR FURTHER ON BEFORE THE ICE AGE THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE NO CONNECTION BETWEEN LAKE MICHIGAN AND LAKE HURON AS THERE IS NOW THROUGH THE STRAITS OF MACKINAC
6115-58776-0022 ANOTHER PREGLACIAL RIVER HAD ITS RISE IN THE REGION OF LAKE HURON AND FLOWED THROUGH AN OLD RIVER BED EXTENDING FROM THE GEORGIAN BAY IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION THROUGH THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO AND EMPTIED INTO THE PRESENT LAKE ONTARIO
6115-58776-0023 FROM LAKE ONTARIO THERE IS AN OLD RIVER BED RUNNING THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE MOHAWK WHICH EMPTIES INTO THE HUDSON AT TROY NEITHER OF THESE TWO RIVERS HAVING THEIR SOURCES IN THE NORTH FOUND AN OUTLET THROUGH THE PRESENT SAINT LAWRENCE RIVER
6115-58776-0024 THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE CENTER OF SNOW AND ICE ACCUMULATION AND EACH OF THESE GREAT CENTERS PROBABLY HAD SEVERAL SUBCENTERS THIS THEORY HAS COLOR GIVEN TO IT BY THE DIRECTIONS OF MOVEMENT SHOWN BY THE GLACIAL DRIFT
6115-58776-0025 THESE BOWLDERS WHEN THEY WERE FIRST TORN FROM THEIR ROCKY BEDS BY THE IRRESISTIBLE POWER OF ICE PRESSURE WERE ROUGH AND JAGGED IN SHAPE THE SAME AS ANY ROCK WOULD BE TORN FROM A QUARRY BY A BLAST
6115-58776-0026 THEY HAVE BEEN SMOOTHED AND ROUNDED BY RUBBING AGAINST THE MOVING ICE AND AGAINST EACH OTHER IN THE PROGRESS OF THEIR LONG JOURNEY FROM THEIR ORIGINAL HOMES WHERE THEIR HOME WAS THE GEOLOGIST CAN IMMEDIATELY TELL UPON EXAMINATION
6115-58776-0027 AND WHEN THEY HAD GROWN TO A SUFFICIENT HEIGHT THEY JOINED AT THEIR EDGES MAKING ONE GRAND GLACIER THE MOVEMENTS OF WHICH WERE THE RESULTANT OF THE COMBINED PRESSURE EXERTED BY THESE GREAT CENTERS OF POWER SO THAT ALL OF NORTH AMERICA NORTH OF THE LINE OF THE TERMINAL MORAINE
6115-58776-0028 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SMALL AREA HERETOFORE NOTED CHIEFLY IN WISCONSIN BECAME COVERED WITH ONE VAST SHEET OF ICE THE GLACIER NORTH OF LAKE SUPERIOR WIDENED OUT THE OLD RIVER BED BY A PROCESS OF EROSION TO ITS PRESENT WIDTH
6115-58776-0029 THERE MAY HAVE EXISTED SOMETHING OF A LAKE IN PREGLACIAL TIMES THROUGH WHICH THE RIVER RAN BUT IT UNDOUBTEDLY OWES ITS PRESENT WIDTH TO THE GRINDING ACTION OF THE IRRESISTIBLE ICEBERGS AND THE PILING UP OF DEBRIS ON THE SHORES
6115-58776-0030 THE RIVER BED WAS FILLED UP BY A GLACIAL DRIFT AT THE POINT OF ITS PRESENT OUTLET UNTIL THE LAKE WAS RAISED IN ITS LEVEL MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT OF LAKE MICHIGAN ANOTHER GLACIER PLOWED DOWN THROUGH LAKE MICHIGAN WIDENING IT OUT
6115-58776-0031 TO ITS PRESENT DIMENSIONS WHILE THE GLACIAL DRIFT WAS DEPOSITED AT WHAT IS NOW THE HEAD OF THE LAKE FILLING UP THE OLD OUTLET AND THUS MAKING A GREAT DAM THE DAMMING UP OF THESE GREAT WATER COURSES WAS ANOTHER CAUSE FOR INCREASING THE WIDTH OF THESE LAKES
6115-58776-0032 IN A SIMILAR WAY LAKE ERIE WAS FORMED IT IS SUPPOSED HOWEVER THAT THIS LAKE IS ENTIRELY THE PRODUCT OF GLACIAL ACTION AS THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF AN OLD RIVER BED IN ITS BOTTOM BESIDES IT IS MUCH SHALLOWER THAN THE OTHER LAKES
6115-58776-0033 THE SAME ACTION THAT FORMED LAKE ERIE FILLED UP THE OLD RIVER BED RUNNING THROUGH THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO SO THAT WHEN THE ICE RECEDED LAKE ERIE BECAME THE NEW CHANNEL FOR THE OLD RIVER
6115-58776-0034 THE SAME PROCESS FILLED UP THE VALLEY OF THE MOHAWK TO MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FEET IN DEPTH AND ALSO RAISED THE VALLEY OF THE HUDSON THIS CAUSED THE NEW CHANNEL TO BE MADE THROUGH THE NIAGARA RIVER AND A NEW ROUTE TO THE OCEAN FOR THE DRAINAGE OF ALL THE CHAIN OF LAKES THROUGH THE SAINT LAWRENCE
6115-58776-0035 WERE WORN OUT BY THE ACTION OF RUNNING WATER EXCEPT ERIE THE GREAT GLACIERS WIDENED THEM OUT AND IN THE CASE OF LAKE ERIE SCOOPED IT OUT AT THE SAME TIME IT BUILT GREAT DAMS ACROSS THE OUTLETS WHICH RAISED THE SURFACE OF THE WATER TO A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL
6115-58776-0036 AND CAUSED THEM TO FORM NEW OUTLETS THUS CHANGING THE WHOLE FACE OF THE COUNTRY OVER WHICH THE ICE DRIFTED THE GLACIATED REGION OF NORTH AMERICA IS AMONG THE MOST PRODUCTIVE IN THE WORLD AND IN MANY RESPECTS PRESENTS A MOST PLEASING LANDSCAPE
6115-58776-0037 OTHER LAKES BESIDES THESE MENTIONED HAVE BEEN FORMED DURING THE ICE PERIOD THROUGH BLOCKING THE COURSE OF A RIVER BY THE ICE ITSELF DOCTOR WRIGHT DURING THE TIME HE TRACED OUT THE LINE OF THE TERMINAL MORAINE DISCOVERED THAT THE ICE SHEET CROSSED THE OHIO RIVER
6115-58776-0038 AT A POINT NEAR CINCINNATI WHERE THERE IS A GREAT BEND TO THE NORTHWARD IN THE RIVER WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THIS POINT AND PERHAPS ANOTHER POINT BELOW
6115-58776-0039 AT THIS POINT HOWEVER THE ICE SEEMS TO HAVE FILLED THE VALLEY FROM HILL TO HILL WHICH VERY NATURALLY WOULD FORM A GREAT DAM OR LAKE IN THE OHIO VALLEY OF COURSE SUCH A LAKE COULD NOT BE PERMANENT BECAUSE WHEN THE ICE MELTED AWAY
6115-58776-0040 IT AGAIN OPENED THE CHANNEL AND ALLOWED THE WATER TO FLOW OFF SOME YEARS BEFORE THIS DISCOVERY WAS MADE THERE WERE TERRACES FOUND ALONG THE BANKS OF THE OHIO RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES THAT HAD BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MUCH SPECULATION
6115-58776-0041 IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT BY THE ACTION OF WATER FROM RAINFALL EARTH GRAVEL AND OTHER DEBRIS WILL WASH DOWN THE SIDE OF A HILL OR MOUNTAIN UNTIL IT STRIKES A WATER LEVEL AND THERE IT WILL BUILD OUT A TERRACE NEAR THE LEVEL OF THE WATER SURFACE
6115-58776-0042 THE WIDTH OF THESE TERRACES WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE TIME THE WATER HAS STOOD AT THAT LEVEL
6115-58776-0043 THE EVIDENCES THAT ARE CITED PRO AND CON
6115-58776-0044 BUT IT IS SUFFICIENT TO SAY HERE THAT THE SUM OF THE EVIDENCE GOES TO SHOW THAT THERE WAS AN ICE DAM FORMED AT A POINT NEAR CINCINNATI
6115-58776-0045 TERRACES WERE FORMED RUNNING UP THE OHIO AND ITS TRIBUTARIES CORRESPONDING TO THE LEVEL THAT THE WATER MUST HAVE RISEN TO IF THE VALLEY WERE FILLED UP WITH ICE THESE FACTS TAKEN WITH THE GREATER FACT THAT THE ICE SHEET ACTUALLY DID CROSS THE OHIO VALLEY INTO KENTUCKY
6115-58776-0046 SEEMS TO PROVE CONCLUSIVELY THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A LAKE DURING THE PERIOD THAT THE ICE RESTED AT ITS EXTREME LIMIT THE FACT THAT IN SOME PLACES SUCCESSIVE TERRACES ARE FOUND DOES NOT DISPROVE THE THEORY
6115-58776-0047 BECAUSE IT IS MORE THAN LIKELY THAT WHEN THE ICE RECEDED IT DID SO IN SUCCESSIVE STAGES
6115-58776-0048 THERE IS ABUNDANT PROOF OF THIS IN THE SUCCESSIVE MORAINES AND ALSO IN THE FORMATION OF SUCCESSIVE TERRACES SOME OF THESE TERRACES COULD HAVE BEEN FORMED FROM OTHER CAUSES IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY GREAT STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION TO UNDERSTAND HOW NUMEROUS LAKES
6115-58776-0049 AS THE ICE MELTED AWAY THE THICK BODIES OF ICE MIGHT BE MANY MANY YEARS IN MELTING
6115-58776-0050 AND THUS FORM A GREAT INLAND SEA FROM THE VAST AMOUNTS OF WATER THAT WOULD COME FROM THE MELTING ICE ALL OF THE REGION ABOUT WINNIPEG IN THE RED RIVER COUNTRY COVERING GREAT AREAS OF HUNDREDS OF MILES IN EXTENT
6115-58776-0051 IS A LEVEL PLAIN ONLY LACKING THE COLORING TO GIVE TO ONE PASSING THROUGH IT THE EFFECT OF A GREAT UNRUFFLED SEA THERE IS NO DOUBT BUT THAT ALL OF THIS REGION WAS THE BOTTOM OF A GREAT LAKE AT SOME PERIOD WHEN THE ICE WAS RECEDING
6115-58776-0052 AND THIS ACCOUNTS FOR THE GREAT DEPTH OF BLACK SOIL THAT WE FIND IN THIS AND OTHER REGIONS THE SOIL WAS A WATER DEPOSIT
6115-58776-0053 WE CAN IMAGINE THAT DURING THIS PERIOD THE WATER THAT FLOWED OFF THROUGH THE GREAT MISSISSIPPI MUST HAVE BEEN OF ENORMOUS VOLUME AS COMPARED TO THE PRESENT TIME A LARGE PORTION OF THE DELTA OF THE MISSISSIPPI
6115-58776-0054 WAS CARRIED DOWN DURING THE ICE MELTING PERIOD DOCTOR WRIGHT AS WE HAVE BEFORE STATED HAS ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE A MILLION SQUARE MILES OF COUNTRY
6115-58776-0055 BY LEVELING DOWN HILLS AND MOUNTAINS IN THE NORTHERN COUNTRY
6115-58776-0056 AND I HAVE NO DOUBT BUT THAT A GREAT PORTION OF LOUISIANA AND WESTERN MISSISSIPPI
6115-58776-0057 AS LARGE OR LARGER THAN LAKE MICHIGAN TO BE DRAINED OFF IN A COMPARATIVELY SHORT TIME WHEN WE THINK OF IT IN THIS LIGHT THE GREAT DELTA OF THE MISSISSIPPI IS EASILY ACCOUNTED FOR THERE ARE EVIDENCES OF A GREAT LAKE IN THE RED RIVER COUNTRY OF THE NORTHWEST
6115-58776-0058 THAT IS MUCH LARGER THAN ANY OF OUR GREATEST LAKES THE SHORES OF THIS LAKE THE BED OF WHICH IS NOW DRY LAND AND THE HEART OF A GREAT AGRICULTURAL REGION ARE WELL DEFINED AND HAVE BEEN SURVEYED AND MAPPED OUT WHEN THIS GREAT BODY OF WATER WAS RELEASED IT WAS TO THE NORTHWARD
