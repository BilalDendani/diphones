2156-25563-0002 HE WAS A PERFECT DUB TO HAVE LET THE SITUATION REACH SUCH A STAGE OF COMPLEXITY THOUGH THE ONE THOUGHT UPPERMOST IN HIS MIND WAS TO SAVE HELEN FROM PUBLIC RIDICULE AND CONTEMPT
2156-25563-0003 HE HAD ALMOST COUNTED ON THE THIEF TAKING ONE CRAVEN LOOK AT HIS CONSTABULARY DISGUISE AND THEN LEAPING THROUGH THE WINDOW FLEEING LIKE A WOLF IN THE NIGHT HE TRAVERS GLADWIN

2156-25563-0012 EVERY NERVE IN PHELAN'S BODY WAS FAIRLY A BRISTLE AS HE MADE HIS WAY UPSTAIRS AND BURST INTO THE GREAT DRAWING ROOM AND PICTURE GALLERY FER THE LOVE O HIVIN HE CRIED
