1748-1562-0000 MAN DOTH USURP ALL SPACE STARES THEE IN ROCK BUSH RIVER IN THE FACE NEVER THINE EYES BEHOLD A TREE TIS NO SEA THOU SEEST IN THE SEA TIS BUT A DISGUISED HUMANITY
1748-1562-0001 TO AVOID THY FELLOW VAIN THY PLAN ALL THAT INTERESTS A MAN IS MAN HENRY SUTTON THE TREES WHICH WERE FAR APART WHERE I ENTERED
1748-1562-0002 CLOSED RAPIDLY AS I ADVANCED SO THAT ERE LONG THEIR CROWDED STEMS BARRED THE SUNLIGHT OUT FORMING AS IT WERE A THICK GRATING BETWEEN ME AND THE EAST I SEEMED TO BE ADVANCING TOWARDS A SECOND MIDNIGHT
1748-1562-0003 IN THE MIDST OF THE INTERVENING TWILIGHT HOWEVER BEFORE I ENTERED WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE DARKEST PORTION OF THE FOREST I SAW A COUNTRY MAIDEN COMING TOWARDS ME FROM ITS VERY DEPTHS SHE DID NOT SEEM TO OBSERVE ME FOR SHE WAS APPARENTLY INTENT UPON A BUNCH OF WILD FLOWERS
1748-1562-0004 WHICH SHE CARRIED IN HER HAND I COULD HARDLY SEE HER FACE FOR THOUGH SHE CAME DIRECT TOWARDS ME SHE NEVER LOOKED UP BUT WHEN WE MET INSTEAD OF PASSING SHE TURNED AND WALKED ALONGSIDE OF ME FOR A FEW YARDS STILL KEEPING HER FACE DOWNWARDS
1748-1562-0005 TRUST THE OAK SAID SHE TRUST THE OAK AND THE ELM AND THE GREAT BEECH TAKE CARE OF THE BIRCH FOR THOUGH SHE IS HONEST SHE IS TOO YOUNG NOT TO BE CHANGEABLE BUT SHUN THE ASH AND THE ALDER FOR THE ASH IS AN OGRE
1748-1562-0006 WALKING STILL WITH THE SAME UNCHANGING GAIT I COULD NOT CONJECTURE WHAT SHE MEANT BUT SATISFIED MYSELF WITH THINKING
1748-1562-0007 WHEN THERE WAS NEED TO MAKE USE OF HER WARNING AND THAT THE OCCASION WOULD REVEAL THE ADMONITION I CONCLUDED FROM THE FLOWERS THAT SHE CARRIED THAT THE FOREST COULD NOT BE EVERYWHERE SO DENSE AS IT APPEARED FROM WHERE I WAS NOW WALKING AND I WAS RIGHT IN THIS CONCLUSION
1748-1562-0008 FOR SOON I CAME TO A MORE OPEN PART AND BY AND BY CROSSED A WIDE GRASSY GLADE ON WHICH WERE SEVERAL CIRCLES OF BRIGHTER GREEN BUT EVEN HERE I WAS STRUCK WITH THE UTTER STILLNESS NO BIRD SANG NO INSECT HUMMED
1748-1562-0009 NOT A LIVING CREATURE CROSSED MY WAY YET SOMEHOW THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENT SEEMED ONLY ASLEEP AND TO WEAR EVEN IN SLEEP AN AIR OF EXPECTATION THE TREES SEEMED ALL TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION OF CONSCIOUS MYSTERY AS IF THEY SAID TO THEMSELVES
1748-1562-0010 WE COULD AN IF WE WOULD THEY HAD ALL A MEANING LOOK ABOUT THEM THEN I REMEMBERED THAT NIGHT IS THE FAIRIES DAY AND THE MOON THEIR SUN AND I THOUGHT EVERYTHING SLEEPS AND DREAMS NOW WHEN THE NIGHT COMES IT WILL BE DIFFERENT
1748-1562-0011 AT THE SAME TIME I BEING A MAN AND A CHILD OF THE DAY FELT SOME ANXIETY AS TO HOW I SHOULD FARE AMONG THE ELVES AND OTHER CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT WHO WAKE WHEN MORTALS DREAM AND FIND THEIR COMMON LIFE
1748-1562-0012 IN THOSE WONDROUS HOURS THAT FLOW NOISELESSLY OVER THE MOVELESS DEATH LIKE FORMS OF MEN AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN LYING STREWN AND PARTED BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF THE HEAVY WAVES OF NIGHT WHICH FLOW ON AND BEAT THEM DOWN AND HOLD THEM DROWNED AND SENSELESS
1748-1562-0013 UNTIL THE EBBTIDE COMES AND THE WAVES SINK AWAY BACK INTO THE OCEAN OF THE DARK BUT I TOOK COURAGE AND WENT ON SOON HOWEVER I BECAME AGAIN ANXIOUS THOUGH FROM ANOTHER CAUSE I HAD EATEN NOTHING THAT DAY
1748-1562-0014 AND FOR AN HOUR PAST HAD BEEN FEELING THE WANT OF FOOD SO I GREW AFRAID LEST I SHOULD FIND NOTHING TO MEET MY HUMAN NECESSITIES IN THIS STRANGE PLACE BUT ONCE MORE I COMFORTED MYSELF WITH HOPE AND WENT ON
1748-1562-0015 BEFORE NOON I FANCIED I SAW A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING AMONGST THE STEMS OF LARGER TREES IN FRONT OF ME AND SOON I CAME TO AN OPEN SPOT OF GROUND IN WHICH STOOD A LITTLE COTTAGE SO BUILT THAT THE STEMS OF FOUR GREAT TREES FORMED ITS CORNERS
1748-1562-0016 WHILE THEIR BRANCHES MET AND INTERTWINED OVER ITS ROOF HEAPING A GREAT CLOUD OF LEAVES OVER IT UP TOWARDS THE HEAVENS I WONDERED AT FINDING A HUMAN DWELLING IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD AND YET IT DID NOT LOOK ALTOGETHER HUMAN
1748-1562-0017 THOUGH SUFFICIENTLY SO TO ENCOURAGE ME TO EXPECT TO FIND SOME SORT OF FOOD SEEING NO DOOR I WENT ROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE AND THERE I FOUND ONE WIDE OPEN A WOMAN SAT BESIDE IT PREPARING SOME VEGETABLES FOR DINNER THIS WAS HOMELY AND COMFORTING
1748-1562-0018 AS I CAME NEAR SHE LOOKED UP AND SEEING ME SHOWED NO SURPRISE BUT BENT HER HEAD AGAIN OVER HER WORK AND SAID IN A LOW TONE DID YOU SEE MY DAUGHTER I BELIEVE I DID SAID I CAN YOU GIVE ME SOMETHING TO EAT FOR I AM VERY HUNGRY
1748-1562-0019 FOR THE ASH IS WATCHING US HAVING SAID THIS SHE ROSE AND LED THE WAY INTO THE COTTAGE WHICH I NOW SAW WAS BUILT OF THE STEMS OF SMALL TREES SET CLOSELY TOGETHER AND WAS FURNISHED WITH ROUGH CHAIRS AND TABLES FROM WHICH EVEN THE BARK HAD NOT BEEN REMOVED
1748-1562-0020 AS SOON AS SHE HAD SHUT THE DOOR AND SET A CHAIR YOU HAVE FAIRY BLOOD IN YOU SAID SHE LOOKING HARD AT ME HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU COULD NOT HAVE GOT SO FAR INTO THIS WOOD IF IT WERE NOT SO
1748-1562-0021 I THINK I SEE IT WHAT DO YOU SEE OH NEVER MIND I MAY BE MISTAKEN IN THAT BUT HOW THEN DO YOU COME TO LIVE HERE BECAUSE I TOO HAVE FAIRY BLOOD IN ME HERE I IN MY TURN LOOKED HARD AT HER AND THOUGHT I COULD PERCEIVE
1748-1562-0022 NOTWITHSTANDING THE COARSENESS OF HER FEATURES AND ESPECIALLY THE HEAVINESS OF HER EYEBROWS A SOMETHING UNUSUAL I COULD HARDLY CALL IT GRACE AND YET IT WAS AN EXPRESSION THAT STRANGELY CONTRASTED WITH THE FORM OF HER FEATURES I NOTICED TOO THAT HER HANDS WERE DELICATELY FORMED
1748-1562-0023 I SHOULD BE ILL SHE CONTINUED IF I DID NOT LIVE ON THE BORDERS OF THE FAIRIES COUNTRY AND NOW AND THEN EAT OF THEIR FOOD AND I SEE BY YOUR EYES THAT YOU ARE NOT QUITE FREE OF THE SAME NEED
1748-1562-0024 SHE ROSE AND LOOKED OUT OF THE LITTLE WINDOW MY EYES FOLLOWED HER BUT AS THE WINDOW WAS TOO SMALL TO ALLOW ANYTHING TO BE SEEN FROM WHERE I WAS SITTING I ROSE AND LOOKED OVER HER SHOULDER I HAD JUST TIME TO SEE ACROSS THE OPEN SPACE ON THE EDGE OF THE DENSER FOREST
1748-1562-0025 IN GENERAL SAID SHE RECOVERING HER COMPOSURE THERE IS NO DANGER IN THE DAYTIME FOR THEN HE IS SOUND ASLEEP BUT THERE IS SOMETHING UNUSUAL GOING ON IN THE WOODS THERE MUST BE SOME SOLEMNITY AMONG THE FAIRIES TO NIGHT
1748-1562-0026 FOR ALL THE TREES ARE RESTLESS AND ALTHOUGH THEY CANNOT COME AWAKE THEY SEE AND HEAR IN THEIR SLEEP BUT WHAT DANGER IS TO BE DREADED FROM HIM INSTEAD OF ANSWERING THE QUESTION SHE WENT AGAIN TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT
1748-1562-0027 SAYING SHE FEARED THE FAIRIES WOULD BE INTERRUPTED BY FOUL WEATHER FOR A STORM WAS BREWING IN THE WEST AND THE SOONER IT GROWS DARK THE SOONER THE ASH WILL BE AWAKE ADDED SHE I ASKED HER HOW SHE KNEW THAT THERE WAS ANY UNUSUAL EXCITEMENT IN THE WOODS
1748-1562-0028 SHE REPLIED BESIDES THE LOOK OF THE TREES THE DOG THERE IS UNHAPPY AND THE EYES AND EARS OF THE WHITE RABBIT ARE REDDER THAN USUAL AND HE FRISKS ABOUT AS IF HE EXPECTED SOME FUN IF THE CAT WERE AT HOME SHE WOULD HAVE HER BACK UP
1748-1562-0029 SAID THE WOMAN BUT WHAT OF THE ASH TREE SAID I RETURNING ONCE MORE TO THE SUBJECT HERE HOWEVER THE YOUNG WOMAN WHOM I HAD MET IN THE MORNING ENTERED A SMILE PASSED BETWEEN THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER
1748-1562-0030 AND THEN THE LATTER BEGAN TO HELP HER MOTHER IN LITTLE HOUSEHOLD DUTIES I SHOULD LIKE TO STAY HERE TILL THE EVENING I SAID AND THEN GO ON MY JOURNEY IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME YOU ARE WELCOME TO DO AS YOU PLEASE ONLY IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO STAY ALL NIGHT THAN RISK THE DANGERS OF THE WOOD THEN
1748-1562-0031 NAY THAT I DO NOT KNOW I REPLIED BUT I WISH TO SEE ALL THAT IS TO BE SEEN AND THEREFORE I SHOULD LIKE TO START JUST AT SUNDOWN YOU ARE A BOLD YOUTH IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHAT YOU ARE DARING BUT A RASH ONE IF YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT AND EXCUSE ME
1748-1562-0032 YOU DO NOT SEEM VERY WELL INFORMED ABOUT THE COUNTRY AND ITS MANNERS HOWEVER NO ONE COMES HERE BUT FOR SOME REASON EITHER KNOWN TO HIMSELF OR TO THOSE WHO HAVE CHARGE OF HIM
1748-1562-0033 ACCORDINGLY I SAT DOWN AND FEELING RATHER TIRED AND DISINCLINED FOR FURTHER TALK I ASKED LEAVE TO LOOK AT THE OLD BOOK WHICH STILL SCREENED THE WINDOW THE WOMAN BROUGHT IT TO ME DIRECTLY
1748-1562-0034 BUT NOT BEFORE TAKING ANOTHER LOOK TOWARDS THE FOREST AND THEN DRAWING A WHITE BLIND OVER THE WINDOW I SAT DOWN OPPOSITE TO IT BY THE TABLE ON WHICH I LAID THE GREAT OLD VOLUME AND READ IT CONTAINED MANY WONDROUS TALES OF FAIRY LAND AND OLDEN TIMES
1748-1562-0035 AND THE KNIGHTS OF KING ARTHUR'S TABLE I READ ON AND ON TILL THE SHADES OF THE AFTERNOON BEGAN TO DEEPEN FOR IN THE MIDST OF THE FOREST IT GLOOMED EARLIER THAN IN THE OPEN COUNTRY AT LENGTH I CAME TO THIS PASSAGE
1748-1562-0036 HERE IT CHANCED THAT UPON THEIR QUEST SIR GALAHAD AND SIR PERCIVALE RENCOUNTERED IN THE DEPTHS OF A GREAT FOREST NOW SIR GALAHAD WAS DIGHT ALL IN HARNESS OF SILVER CLEAR AND SHINING THE WHICH IS A DELIGHT TO LOOK UPON
1748-1562-0037 BUT FULL HASTY TO TARNISH AND WITHOUTEN THE LABOUR OF A READY SQUIRE UNEATH TO BE KEPT FAIR AND CLEAN AND YET WITHOUTEN SQUIRE OR PAGE SIR GALAHAD'S ARMOUR SHONE LIKE THE MOON AND HE RODE A GREAT WHITE MARE WHOSE BASES AND OTHER HOUSINGS WERE BLACK
1748-1562-0038 BUT ALL BESPRENT WITH FAIR LILYS OF SILVER SHEEN WHEREAS SIR PERCIVALE BESTRODE A RED HORSE WITH A TAWNY MANE AND TAIL WHOSE TRAPPINGS WERE ALL TO SMIRCHED WITH MUD AND MIRE AND HIS ARMOUR WAS WONDROUS ROSTY TO BEHOLD
1748-1562-0039 NE COULD HE BY ANY ART FURBISH IT AGAIN SO THAT AS THE SUN IN HIS GOING DOWN SHONE TWIXT THE BARE TRUNKS OF THE TREES FULL UPON THE KNIGHTS TWAIN THE ONE DID SEEM ALL SHINING WITH LIGHT AND THE OTHER ALL TO GLOW WITH RUDDY FIRE
1748-1562-0040 SO THAT IT WAS MUCH WIDER ACROSS THE FINGERS THAN ACROSS THE UNDIVIDED PART OF THE HAND PASSED SLOWLY OVER THE LITTLE BLIND AND THEN AS SLOWLY RETURNED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION HE IS ALMOST AWAKE MOTHER AND GREEDIER THAN USUAL TO NIGHT
1748-1562-0041 FOR YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW SOON SOMETHING MAY HAPPEN TO OBLIGE US TO BE IN THE FOREST AFTER NIGHTFALL BUT YOU ARE IN THE FOREST SAID I HOW IS IT THAT YOU ARE SAFE HERE HE DARES NOT COME NEARER THAN HE IS NOW SHE REPLIED
1748-1562-0042 FOR ANY OF THOSE FOUR OAKS AT THE CORNERS OF OUR COTTAGE WOULD TEAR HIM TO PIECES THEY ARE OUR FRIENDS BUT HE STANDS THERE AND MAKES AWFUL FACES AT US SOMETIMES AND STRETCHES OUT HIS LONG ARMS AND FINGERS AND TRIES TO KILL US WITH FRIGHT
1748-1562-0043 BUT WE SHALL SOON SEE WHETHER YOU CAN DISCERN THE FAIRIES IN MY LITTLE GARDEN AND THAT WILL BE SOME GUIDE TO US ARE THE TREES FAIRIES TOO AS WELL AS THE FLOWERS I ASKED THEY ARE OF THE SAME RACE SHE REPLIED
1748-1562-0044 THOUGH THOSE YOU CALL FAIRIES IN YOUR COUNTRY ARE CHIEFLY THE YOUNG CHILDREN OF THE FLOWER FAIRIES THEY ARE VERY FOND OF HAVING FUN WITH THE THICK PEOPLE AS THEY CALL YOU FOR LIKE MOST CHILDREN THEY LIKE FUN BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE WHY DO YOU HAVE FLOWERS SO NEAR YOU THEN
1748-1562-0045 DO THEY NOT ANNOY YOU OH NO THEY ARE VERY AMUSING WITH THEIR MIMICRIES OF GROWN PEOPLE AND MOCK SOLEMNITIES SOMETIMES THEY WILL ACT A WHOLE PLAY THROUGH BEFORE MY EYES WITH PERFECT COMPOSURE AND ASSURANCE FOR THEY ARE NOT AFRAID OF ME
1748-1562-0046 ONLY AS SOON AS THEY HAVE DONE THEY BURST INTO PEALS OF TINY LAUGHTER AS IF IT WAS SUCH A JOKE TO HAVE BEEN SERIOUS OVER ANYTHING THESE I SPEAK OF HOWEVER ARE THE FAIRIES OF THE GARDEN
1748-1562-0047 AND VERY LITTLE OF MANNERS NOW AND THEN HOWEVER THEY ARE COMPELLED TO ENVY THE GRACE AND SIMPLICITY OF THE NATURAL FLOWERS DO THEY LIVE IN THE FLOWERS I SAID I CANNOT TELL SHE REPLIED
1748-1562-0048 SOMETIMES THEY DISAPPEAR ALTOGETHER EVEN FROM ME THOUGH I KNOW THEY ARE NEAR THEY SEEM TO DIE ALWAYS WITH THE FLOWERS THEY RESEMBLE AND BY WHOSE NAMES THEY ARE CALLED BUT WHETHER THEY RETURN TO LIFE WITH THE FRESH FLOWERS OR WHETHER IT BE NEW FLOWERS NEW FAIRIES I CANNOT TELL
1748-1562-0049 THEY HAVE AS MANY SORTS OF DISPOSITIONS AS MEN AND WOMEN WHILE THEIR MOODS ARE YET MORE VARIABLE TWENTY DIFFERENT EXPRESSIONS WILL CROSS THEIR LITTLE FACES IN HALF A MINUTE I OFTEN AMUSE MYSELF WITH WATCHING THEM
1748-1562-0050 IF I SPEAK TO ONE HE OR SHE LOOKS UP IN MY FACE AS IF I WERE NOT WORTH HEEDING GIVES A LITTLE LAUGH AND RUNS AWAY HERE THE WOMAN STARTED AS IF SUDDENLY RECOLLECTING HERSELF AND SAID IN A LOW VOICE TO HER DAUGHTER MAKE HASTE GO AND WATCH HIM AND SEE IN WHAT DIRECTION HE GOES
1748-1562-0051 THAT THE FLOWERS DIE BECAUSE THE FAIRIES GO AWAY NOT THAT THE FAIRIES DISAPPEAR BECAUSE THE FLOWERS DIE THE FLOWERS SEEM A SORT OF HOUSES FOR THEM OR OUTER BODIES WHICH THEY CAN PUT ON OR OFF WHEN THEY PLEASE
1748-1562-0052 JUST AS YOU COULD FORM SOME IDEA OF THE NATURE OF A MAN FROM THE KIND OF HOUSE HE BUILT IF HE FOLLOWED HIS OWN TASTE SO YOU COULD WITHOUT SEEING THE FAIRIES TELL WHAT ANY ONE OF THEM IS LIKE BY LOOKING AT THE FLOWER TILL YOU FEEL THAT YOU UNDERSTAND IT FOR JUST WHAT THE FLOWER SAYS TO YOU
1748-1562-0053 YET YOU WOULD SEE A STRANGE RESEMBLANCE ALMOST ONENESS BETWEEN THE FLOWER AND THE FAIRY
1748-1562-0054 WHETHER ALL THE FLOWERS HAVE FAIRIES I CANNOT DETERMINE ANY MORE THAN I CAN BE SURE WHETHER ALL MEN AND WOMEN HAVE SOULS THE WOMAN AND I CONTINUED THE CONVERSATION FOR A FEW MINUTES LONGER
1748-1562-0055 I WAS MUCH INTERESTED BY THE INFORMATION SHE GAVE ME AND ASTONISHED AT THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH SHE WAS ABLE TO CONVEY IT IT SEEMED THAT INTERCOURSE WITH THE FAIRIES WAS NO BAD EDUCATION IN ITSELF BUT NOW THE DAUGHTER RETURNED WITH THE NEWS
1748-1562-0056 THAT THE ASH HAD JUST GONE AWAY IN A SOUTH WESTERLY DIRECTION AND AS MY COURSE SEEMED TO LIE EASTWARD SHE HOPED I SHOULD BE IN NO DANGER OF MEETING HIM IF I DEPARTED AT ONCE I LOOKED OUT OF THE LITTLE WINDOW AND THERE STOOD THE ASH TREE TO MY EYES THE SAME AS BEFORE
1748-1562-0057 BUT I BELIEVED THAT THEY KNEW BETTER THAN I DID AND PREPARED TO GO I PULLED OUT MY PURSE BUT TO MY DISMAY THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT THE WOMAN WITH A SMILE BEGGED ME NOT TO TROUBLE MYSELF FOR MONEY WAS NOT OF THE SLIGHTEST USE THERE
1748-1562-0058 FOR NOTHING OFFENDED THEM SO MUCH THEY WOULD THINK SHE ADDED THAT YOU WERE MAKING GAME OF THEM AND THAT IS THEIR PECULIAR PRIVILEGE WITH REGARD TO US
1748-1562-0059 FROM THE CUPS OR BELLS OF TALL FLOWERS AS FROM BALCONIES SOME LOOKED DOWN ON THE MASSES BELOW NOW BURSTING WITH LAUGHTER NOW GRAVE AS OWLS BUT EVEN IN THEIR DEEPEST SOLEMNITY SEEMING ONLY TO BE WAITING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE NEXT LAUGH
1748-1562-0060 SOME WERE LAUNCHED ON A LITTLE MARSHY STREAM AT THE BOTTOM IN BOATS CHOSEN FROM THE HEAPS OF LAST YEAR'S LEAVES THAT LAY ABOUT CURLED AND WITHERED THESE SOON SANK WITH THEM WHEREUPON THEY SWAM ASHORE AND GOT OTHERS
1748-1562-0061 THOSE WHO TOOK FRESH ROSE LEAVES FOR THEIR BOATS FLOATED THE LONGEST BUT FOR THESE THEY HAD TO FIGHT FOR THE FAIRY OF THE ROSE TREE COMPLAINED BITTERLY THAT THEY WERE STEALING HER CLOTHES AND DEFENDED HER PROPERTY BRAVELY YOU CAN'T WEAR HALF YOU'VE GOT SAID SOME
1748-1562-0062 NEVER YOU MIND I DON'T CHOOSE YOU TO HAVE THEM THEY ARE MY PROPERTY ALL FOR THE GOOD OF THE COMMUNITY SAID ONE AND RAN OFF WITH A GREAT HOLLOW LEAF BUT THE ROSE FAIRY SPRANG AFTER HIM WHAT A BEAUTY SHE WAS ONLY TOO LIKE A DRAWING ROOM YOUNG LADY
1748-1562-0063 KNOCKED HIM HEELS OVER HEAD AS HE RAN AND RECOVERED HER GREAT RED LEAF BUT IN THE MEANTIME TWENTY HAD HURRIED OFF IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS WITH OTHERS JUST AS GOOD
1748-1562-0064 SENT A PERFECT PINK SNOWSTORM OF PETALS FROM HER TREE LEAPING FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH AND STAMPING AND SHAKING AND PULLING AT LAST AFTER ANOTHER GOOD CRY SHE CHOSE THE BIGGEST SHE COULD FIND AND RAN AWAY LAUGHING TO LAUNCH HER BOAT AMONGST THE REST
1748-1562-0065 SISTER SNOWDROP DIED BEFORE WE WERE BORN
1748-1562-0066 WHAT IS SNOW NEVER TRIED DO NOT KNOW WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT HER LITTLE PRIMROSE THERE CANNOT DO WITHOUT HER OH SO SWEETLY FAIR NEVER FEAR SHE WILL COME PRIMROSE DEAR IS SHE DUMB
1748-1562-0067 SHE'LL COME BY AND BY YOU WILL NEVER SEE HER SHE WENT HOME TO DIES TILL THE NEW YEAR SNOWDROP TIS NO GOOD TO INVITE HER PRIMROSE IS VERY RUDE I WILL BITE HER OH YOU NAUGHTY POCKET
1748-1562-0068 LOOK SHE DROPS HER HEAD SHE DESERVED IT ROCKET AND SHE WAS NEARLY DEAD TO YOUR HAMMOCK OFF WITH YOU AND SWING ALONE NO ONE WILL LAUGH WITH YOU NO NOT ONE NOW LET US MOAN
1748-1562-0069 NOW SHE IS DONE THAT WAS THE DUTY NOW FOR THE FUN AND WITH A WILD LAUGH THEY SPRANG AWAY MOST OF THEM TOWARDS THE COTTAGE DURING THE LATTER PART OF THE SONG TALK THEY HAD FORMED THEMSELVES INTO A FUNERAL PROCESSION TWO OF THEM BEARING POOR PRIMROSE
1748-1562-0070 WHO HAD BEEN EXPELLED FROM THE COMPANY BY COMMON CONSENT WENT SULKILY AWAY TOWARDS HER HAMMOCK FOR SHE WAS THE FAIRY OF THE CALCEOLARIA AND LOOKED RATHER WICKED WHEN SHE REACHED ITS STEM SHE STOPPED AND LOOKED ROUND I COULD NOT HELP SPEAKING TO HER FOR I STOOD NEAR HER I SAID POCKET
1748-1562-0071 THE FURIOUS CAT WAS HELD FAST AND THEY PROCEEDED TO PICK THE SPARKS OUT OF HER WITH THORNS AND PINS WHICH THEY HANDLED LIKE HARPOONS INDEED THERE WERE MORE INSTRUMENTS AT WORK ABOUT HER THAN THERE COULD HAVE BEEN SPARKS IN HER ONE LITTLE FELLOW WHO HELD ON HARD BY THE TIP OF THE TAIL
1748-1562-0072 WITH HIS FEET PLANTED ON THE GROUND AT AN ANGLE OF FORTY FIVE DEGREES HELPING TO KEEP HER FAST ADMINISTERED A CONTINUOUS FLOW OF ADMONITIONS TO PUSSY NOW PUSSY BE PATIENT YOU KNOW QUITE WELL IT IS ALL FOR YOUR GOOD YOU CANNOT BE COMFORTABLE WITH ALL THOSE SPARKS IN YOU
1748-1562-0073 AND INDEED I AM CHARITABLY DISPOSED TO BELIEVE HERE HE BECAME VERY POMPOUS THAT THEY ARE THE CAUSE OF ALL YOUR BAD TEMPER SO WE MUST HAVE THEM ALL OUT EVERY ONE ELSE WE SHALL BE REDUCED TO THE PAINFUL NECESSITY OF CUTTING YOUR CLAWS AND PULLING OUT YOUR EYE TEETH
1748-1562-0074 QUIET PUSSY QUIET BUT WITH A PERFECT HURRICANE OF FELINE CURSES THE POOR ANIMAL BROKE LOOSE AND DASHED ACROSS THE GARDEN AND THROUGH THE HEDGE FASTER THAN EVEN THE FAIRIES COULD FOLLOW NEVER MIND NEVER MIND WE SHALL FIND HER AGAIN
1748-1562-0075 HOORAY AND OFF THEY SET AFTER SOME NEW MISCHIEF BUT I WILL NOT LINGER TO ENLARGE ON THE AMUSING DISPLAY OF THESE FROLICSOME CREATURES THEIR MANNERS AND HABITS ARE NOW SO WELL KNOWN TO THE WORLD HAVING BEEN SO OFTEN DESCRIBED BY EYEWITNESSES
1748-1562-0076 I CANNOT HELP WISHING HOWEVER THAT MY READERS COULD SEE THEM FOR THEMSELVES
1748-1562-0077 A LITTLE CHUBBY ROUND EYED CHILD WITH SUCH INNOCENT TRUST IN HIS LOOK EVEN THE MOST MISCHIEVOUS OF THE FAIRIES WOULD NOT TEASE HIM ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT BELONG TO THEIR SET AT ALL BUT WAS QUITE A LITTLE COUNTRY BUMPKIN
1748-1562-0078 HE WANDERED ABOUT ALONE AND LOOKED AT EVERYTHING WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS LITTLE POCKETS AND A WHITE NIGHT CAP ON THE DARLING
