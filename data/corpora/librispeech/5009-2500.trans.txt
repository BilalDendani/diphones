5009-2500-0000 THE BROKEN SHAGGY RAMPARTS OF THE GIANT CRATER ROSE ABOVE US WE TOILED UPWARD OUT OF THE FOOTHILLS CLINGING NOW TO THE CRAGS AND PITTED TERRACES OF THE MAIN ASCENT AN HOUR HAD PASSED SINCE WE TURNED FROM THE BORDERS OF MARE IMBRIUM
5009-2500-0001 OR WAS IT TWO HOURS I COULD NOT TELL I ONLY KNOW THAT WE RAN WITH DESPERATE FRANTIC HASTE ANITA WOULD NOT ADMIT THAT SHE WAS TIRED SHE WAS MORE SKILLFUL THAN I IN THIS LEAPING OVER THE BROKEN ROCK MASSES
5009-2500-0002 YET I FELT THAT HER SLIGHT STRENGTH MUST GIVE OUT IT SEEMED MILES UP THE UNDULATING SLOPES OF THE FOOTHILLS WITH THE BLACK AND WHITE RAMPARTS OF THE CRATER CLOSE BEFORE US AND THEN THE MAIN ASCENT
5009-2500-0003 THERE WERE PLACES WHERE LIKE SMOOTH BLACK FROZEN ICE THE WALLS ROSE SHEER WE AVOIDED THEM TOILING ASIDE PLUNGING INTO GULLIES CROSSING PITS WHERE SOMETIMES PERFORCE WE WENT DOWNWARDS AND THEN UP AGAIN
5009-2500-0004 OR SOMETIMES WE STOOD HOT AND BREATHLESS UPON LEDGES RECOVERING OUR STRENGTH SELECTING THE BEST ROUTE UPWARD IN TUMBLED MASS OF ROCK HONEYCOMBED EVERYWHERE WITH CAVES AND PASSAGES LEADING INTO IMPENETRABLE DARKNESS
5009-2500-0005 WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN UPON THIS MAIN ASCENT FOR AN HOUR THE PLAINS WERE FAR DOWN THE BROKEN SURFACE DOWN THERE SMOOTHED NOW BY THE PERSPECTIVE OF HEIGHT AND YET STILL ABOVE US THE BROODING CIRCULAR WALL WENT UP INTO THE SKY
5009-2500-0006 TEN THOUSAND FEET ABOVE US YOU'RE TIRED ANITA WE'D BETTER STAY HERE NO IF WE COULD ONLY GET TO THE TOP THE SHIP MAY LAND ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY WOULD SEE US THERE WAS AS YET NO SIGN OF THE BRIGAND SHIP
5009-2500-0007 WITH EVERY STOP FOR REST WE SEARCHED THE STARRY VAULT THE EARTH HUNG OVER US FLATTENED BEYOND THE FULL
5009-2500-0008 OF THE ARCHIMEDES WALLS BUT NO SPECK APPEARED TO TELL US THAT THE SHIP WAS UP THERE WE WERE ON THE CURVING SIDE OF THE ARCHIMEDES WALL WHICH FRONTED THE MARE IMBRIUM TO THE NORTH THE PLAINS LAY LIKE A GREAT FROZEN SEA
5009-2500-0009 CONGEALED RIPPLES SHINING IN THE LIGHT OF THE EARTH WITH DARK PATCHES TO MARK THE HOLLOWS SOMEWHERE DOWN THERE SIX OR EIGHT THOUSAND FEET BELOW US NOW MIKO'S ENCAMPMENT LAY CONCEALED WE SEARCHED FOR LIGHTS OF IT BUT COULD SEE NONE
5009-2500-0010 LEFT HIS CAMP AND COME HERE LIKE OURSELVES TO CLIMB ARCHIMEDES OR WAS OUR ASSUMPTION WHOLLY WRONG PERHAPS THE BRIGAND SHIP WOULD NOT LAND NEAR HERE AT ALL
5009-2500-0011 THE PLAINS WERE LESS SMOOTH THE LITTLE CRATER WHICH CONCEALED THE GRANTLINE CAMP WAS OFF IN THE CRATER SCARRED REGION BEYOND WHICH THE DISTANT APENNINES RAISED THEIR TERRACED WALLS THERE WAS NOTHING TO MARK IT FROM HERE
5009-2500-0012 SHE ADDED THERE SEEMS TO BE A BLUR HER SIGHT SHARPER THAN MINE HAD PICKED IT OUT THE DESCENDING BRIGAND SHIP A FAINTEST TINY BLUR AGAINST THE STARS A FEW OF THEM OCCULTED
5009-2500-0013 AS THOUGH AN INVISIBLE SHADOW WERE UPON THEM A GROWING SHADOW MATERIALIZING INTO A BLUR A BLOB A SHAPE FAINTLY DEFINED THEN SHARPER UNTIL WE WERE SURE OF WHAT WE SAW IT WAS THE BRIGAND SHIP
5009-2500-0014 IT WAS DROPPING SLOWLY SILENTLY DOWN WE CROUCHED ON THE LITTLE LEDGE A CAVE MOUTH WAS BEHIND US A GULLY WAS BESIDE US A BREAK IN THE LEDGE AND AT OUR FEET THE SHEER WALL DROPPED
5009-2500-0015 WE HAD EXTINGUISHED OUR LIGHTS WE CROUCHED SILENTLY GAZING UP INTO THE STARS THE SHIP WHEN WE FIRST DISTINGUISHED IT WAS CENTERED OVER ARCHIMEDES WE THOUGHT FOR A WHILE THAT IT MIGHT DESCEND INTO THE CRATER BUT IT DID NOT
5009-2500-0016 MIKO HAD FORCED SNAP TO SIGNAL THIS BRIGAND BAND ON MARS MIKO'S ONLY INFORMATION AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE GRANTLINE CAMP WAS THAT IT LAY BETWEEN ARCHIMEDES AND THE APENNINES THE BRIGANDS NOW WERE FOLLOWING THAT INFORMATION
5009-2500-0017 A TENSE INTERVAL PASSED WE COULD SEE THE SHIP PLAINLY ABOVE US NOW A GRAY BLACK SHAPE AMONG THE STARS UP BEYOND THE SHAGGY TOWERING CRATER RIM THE VESSEL CAME UPON A LEVEL KEEL HULL DOWN SLOWLY CIRCLING
5009-2500-0018 LOOKING FOR MIKO'S SIGNAL NO DOUBT OR FOR POSSIBLE LIGHTS FROM GRANTLINE'S CAMP THEY MIGHT ALSO BE PICKING A LANDING PLACE WE SAW IT SOON AS A CYLINDRICAL CIGARLIKE SHAPE RATHER SMALLER THAN THE PLANETARA BUT SIMILAR OF DESIGN
5009-2500-0019 IT BORE LIGHTS NOW THE PORTS OF ITS HULL WERE TINY ROWS OF ILLUMINATION AND THE GLOW OF LIGHT UNDER ITS ROUNDING UPPER DOME WAS FAINTLY VISIBLE A BANDIT SHIP NO DOUBT OF THAT ITS IDENTIFICATION KEEL PLATE WAS EMPTY OF OFFICIAL PASS CODE LIGHTS
5009-2500-0020 THESE BRIGANDS HAD NOT ATTEMPTED TO SECURE OFFICIAL SAILING LIGHTS WHEN LEAVING FERROK SHAHN IT WAS UNMISTAKABLY AN OUTLAW SHIP AND HERE UPON THE DESERTED MOON THERE WAS NO NEED FOR SECRECY ITS LIGHTS WERE OPENLY DISPLAYED
5009-2500-0021 AND JOIN IT IT WENT SLOWLY PAST US ONLY A FEW THOUSAND FEET HIGHER THAN OUR LEVEL WE COULD SEE THE WHOLE OUTLINE OF ITS POINTED CYLINDER HULL WITH THE ROUNDED DOME ON TOP AND UNDER THE DOME WAS ITS OPEN DECK WITH A LITTLE CABIN SUPERSTRUCTURE IN THE CENTER
5009-2500-0022 I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THAT BY SOME UNFORTUNATE CHANCE IT MIGHT LAND QUITE NEAR US BUT IT WENT PAST AND THEN I SAW THAT IT WAS HEADING FOR A LEVEL PLATEAULIKE SURFACE A FEW MILES FURTHER ON IT DROPPED CAUTIOUSLY FLOATING DOWN
5009-2500-0023 BUT I REALIZED THAT HASTE WAS NECESSARY WE MUST BE THE FIRST TO JOIN THE BRIGAND SHIP I LIFTED ANITA TO HER FEET I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD SIGNAL FROM HERE
5009-2500-0024 WE COULD NOT TELL WHERE HE WAS DOWN ON THE PLAINS PERHAPS OR UP HERE SOMEWHERE IN THESE MILES OF TOWERING ROCKS ARE YOU READY ANITA YES GREGG
5009-2500-0025 I STARED THROUGH THE VISORS AT HER WHITE SOLEMN FACE YES I'M READY SHE REPEATED HER HAND PRESSURE SEEMED TO ME SUDDENLY LIKE A FAREWELL WE WERE PLUNGING RASHLY INTO WHAT WAS DESTINED TO MEAN OUR DEATH
5009-2500-0026 WAS THIS A FAREWELL AN INSTINCT TOLD ME NOT TO DO THIS THING WHY IN A FEW HOURS I COULD HAVE ANITA BACK TO THE COMPARATIVE SAFETY OF THE GRANTLINE CAMP THE EXIT PORTS WOULD DOUBTLESS BE REPAIRED BY NOW
5009-2500-0027 I COULD GET HER INSIDE SHE HAD BOUNDED AWAY FROM ME LEAPED DOWN SOME THIRTY FEET INTO THE BROKEN GULLY TO CROSS IT AND THEN UP ON THE OTHER SIDE I STOOD FOR AN INSTANT WATCHING HER FANTASTIC SHAPE WITH THE GREAT ROUNDED GOGGLED TRUNKED HELMET
5009-2500-0028 AND THE LUMP ON HER SHOULDERS WHICH HELD THE LITTLE ERENTZ MOTORS THEN I HURRIED AFTER HER IT DID NOT TAKE US LONG TWO OR THREE MILES OF CIRCLING ALONG THE GIANT WALL THE SHIP LAY ONLY A FEW HUNDRED FEET ABOVE OUR LEVEL
5009-2500-0029 THE LIGHTS OF THE SHIP WERE CLOSE OVER US AND THERE WERE MOVING LIGHTS UP THERE TINY MOVING SPOTS ON THE ADJACENT ROCKS THE BRIGANDS HAD COME OUT PROWLING ABOUT TO INVESTIGATE THEIR LOCATION
5009-2500-0030 I'LL FLASH NOW I WHISPERED YES
5009-2500-0031 I TOOK THE LAMP FROM MY HELMET MY HAND WAS TREMBLING SUPPOSE MY SIGNAL WERE ANSWERED BY A SHOT A FLASH FROM SOME GIANT PROJECTOR MOUNTED ON THE SHIP ANITA CROUCHED BEHIND A ROCK AS SHE HAD PROMISED
5009-2500-0032 I STOOD WITH MY TORCH AND FLUNG ITS SWITCH MY PUNY LIGHT BEAM SHOT UP I WAVED IT TOUCHED THE SHIP WITH ITS FAINT GLOWING CIRCLE OF ILLUMINATION THEY SAW ME THERE WAS A SUDDEN MOVEMENT AMONG THE LIGHTS UP THERE I SEMAPHORED
5009-2500-0033 DO NOT FIRE I USED OPEN UNIVERSAL CODE IN MARTIAN FIRST AND THEN IN ENGLISH THERE WAS NO ANSWER BUT NO ATTACK I TRIED AGAIN THIS IS HALJAN ONE OF THE PLANETARA
5009-2500-0034 GEORGE PRINCE'S SISTER IS WITH ME
5009-2500-0035 A SMALL LIGHT BEAM CAME DOWN FROM THE BRINK OF THE OVERHEAD CLIFF BESIDE THE SHIP CONTINUE I WENT STEADILY ON DISASTER THE PLANETARA IS WRECKED
5009-2500-0036 ALL KILLED BUT ME AND PRINCE'S SISTER WE WANT TO JOIN YOU I FLASHED OFF MY LIGHT THE ANSWER CAME WHERE IS THE GRANTLINE CAMP
5009-2500-0037 AS THOUGH TO ANSWER MY LIE FROM DOWN ON THE EARTHLIT PLAINS SOME TEN MILES OR SO FROM THE CRATER BASE A TINY SIGNAL LIGHT SHOT UP ANITA SAW IT AND GRIPPED ME THERE IS MIKO'S LIGHT
5009-2500-0038 IT SPELLED IN MARTIAN COME DOWN LAND
5009-2500-0039 MIKO HAD SEEN THE SIGNALING UP HERE AND HAD JOINED IT HE REPEATED LAND MARE IMBRIUM I FLASHED A PROTEST UP TO THE SHIP BEWARE THAT IS GRANTLINE TRICKERY
5009-2500-0040 FROM THE SHIP THE SUMMONS CAME COME UP WE HAD WON THIS FIRST ENCOUNTER MIKO MUST HAVE REALIZED HIS DISADVANTAGE HIS DISTANT LIGHT WENT OUT COME ANITA
5009-2500-0041 THERE WAS NO RETREAT NOW BUT AGAIN I SEEMED TO FEEL IN THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND THAT VAGUE FAREWELL HER VOICE WHISPERED WE MUST DO OUR BEST ACT OUR BEST TO BE CONVINCING
5009-2500-0042 IN THE WHITE GLOW OF A SEARCHBEAM WE CLIMBED THE CRAGS REACHED THE BROAD UPPER LEDGE HELMETED FIGURES RUSHED AT US SEARCHED US FOR WEAPONS SEIZED OUR HELMET LIGHTS THE EVIL FACE OF A GIANT MARTIAN PEERED AT ME THROUGH THE VISORS
5009-2500-0043 TWO OTHER MONSTROUS TOWERING FIGURES SEIZED ANITA WE WERE SHOVED TOWARD THE PORT LOCKS AT THE BASE OF THE SHIP'S HULL ABOVE THE HULL BULGE I COULD SEE THE GRIDS OF PROJECTORS MOUNTED ON THE DOME SIDE
5009-2500-0044 AND THE FIGURES OF MEN STANDING ON THE DECK PEERING DOWN AT US WE WENT THROUGH THE ADMISSION LOCKS INTO A HULL CORRIDOR
