557-129796-0000 IN THE ALREADY CORDIAL RELATIONS BETWEEN CAPTAIN BLOOD AND THE GOVERNOR OF TORTUGA AT THE FINE STONE HOUSE WITH ITS GREEN JALOUSIED WINDOWS
557-129796-0001 IN A SPACIOUS AND LUXURIANT GARDEN TO THE EAST OF CAYONA THE CAPTAIN BECAME A VERY WELCOME GUEST
557-129796-0002 PIECES OF EIGHT WHICH HE HAD PROVIDED FOR MADEMOISELLE'S RANSOM AND SHREWD HARD BARGAIN DRIVER THOUGH HE MIGHT BE
557-129796-0003 THIS HE NOW PROVED IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY AND UNDER HIS POWERFUL PROTECTION THE CREDIT OF CAPTAIN BLOOD AMONG THE BUCCANEERS VERY RAPIDLY REACHED ITS ZENITH SO WHEN IT CAME TO FITTING OUT HIS FLEET
557-129796-0004 AND THE APPOINTMENT WAS CONFIRMED BY THE MEN IT WAS SOME MONTHS AFTER THE RESCUE OF MADEMOISELLE D'OGERON IN AUGUST OF THAT YEAR SIXTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THAT THIS LITTLE FLEET AFTER SOME MINOR ADVENTURES WHICH I PASS OVER IN SILENCE
557-129796-0005 SAILED INTO THE GREAT LAKE OF MARACAYBO AND EFFECTED ITS RAID UPON THAT OPULENT CITY OF THE MAIN THE AFFAIR DID NOT PROCEED EXACTLY AS WAS HOPED AND BLOOD'S FORCE CAME TO FIND ITSELF IN A PRECARIOUS POSITION
557-129796-0006 THIS IS BEST EXPLAINED IN THE WORDS EMPLOYED BY CAHUSAC WHICH PITT HAS CAREFULLY RECORDED IN THE COURSE OF AN ALTERCATION THAT BROKE OUT
557-129796-0007 ON THE STEPS OF THE CHURCH OF NUESTRA SENORA DEL CARMEN WHICH CAPTAIN BLOOD HAD IMPIOUSLY APPROPRIATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF A CORPS DE GARDE I HAVE SAID ALREADY THAT HE WAS A PAPIST ONLY WHEN IT SUITED HIM
557-129796-0008 THE DISPUTE WAS BEING CONDUCTED BY HAGTHORPE WOLVERSTONE AND PITT ON THE ONE SIDE AND CAHUSAC OUT OF WHOSE UNEASINESS IT ALL AROSE ON THE OTHER BEHIND THEM IN THE SUN SCORCHED DUSTY SQUARE
557-129796-0009 SPARSELY FRINGED BY PALMS WHOSE FRONDS DROOPED LISTLESSLY IN THE QUIVERING HEAT SURGED A COUPLE OF HUNDRED WILD FELLOWS BELONGING TO BOTH PARTIES THEIR OWN EXCITEMENT MOMENTARILY QUELLED
557-129796-0010 SO THAT THEY MIGHT LISTEN TO WHAT PASSED AMONG THEIR LEADERS CAHUSAC APPEARED TO BE HAVING IT ALL HIS OWN WAY AND HE RAISED HIS HARSH QUERULOUS VOICE SO THAT ALL MIGHT HEAR HIS TRUCULENT DENUNCIATION HE SPOKE
557-129796-0011 PITT TELLS US A DREADFUL KIND OF ENGLISH WHICH THE SHIPMASTER HOWEVER MAKES LITTLE ATTEMPT TO REPRODUCE HIS DRESS WAS AS DISCORDANT AS HIS SPEECH IT WAS OF A KIND TO ADVERTISE HIS TRADE
557-129796-0012 AND THE ALMOST FOPPISH DAINTINESS OF JEREMY PITT HIS SOILED AND BLOOD STAINED SHIRT OF BLUE COTTON WAS OPEN IN FRONT TO COOL HIS HAIRY BREAST AND THE GIRDLE ABOUT THE WAIST OF HIS LEATHER BREECHES
557-129796-0013 WHILST A CUTLASS HUNG FROM A LEATHER BALDRICK LOOSELY SLUNG ABOUT HIS BODY ABOVE HIS COUNTENANCE BROAD AND FLAT AS A MONGOLIAN'S
557-129796-0014 TURBAN WISE ABOUT HIS HEAD IS IT THAT I HAVE NOT WARNED YOU FROM THE BEGINNING THAT ALL WAS TOO EASY HE DEMANDED BETWEEN PLAINTIVENESS AND FURY I AM NO FOOL MY FRIENDS
557-129796-0015 AND I SEE I SEE AN ABANDONED FORT AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE LAKE AND NOBODY THERE TO FIRE A GUN AT US WHEN WE CAME IN THEN I SUSPECT THE TRAP WHO WOULD NOT THAT HAD EYES AND BRAIN BAH WE COME ON
557-129796-0016 WHAT DO WE FIND A CITY ABANDONED LIKE THE FORT A CITY OUT OF WHICH
557-129796-0017 AGAIN I WARN CAPTAIN BLOOD IT IS A TRAP I SAY WE ARE TO COME ON ALWAYS TO COME ON WITHOUT OPPOSITION UNTIL WE FIND THAT IT IS TOO LATE TO GO TO SEA AGAIN THAT WE CANNOT GO BACK AT ALL
557-129796-0018 BUT NO ONE WILL LISTEN TO ME YOU ALL KNOW SO MUCH MORE NAME OF GOD CAPTAIN BLOOD HE WILL GO ON AND WE GO ON WE GO TO GIBRALTAR TRUE THAT AT LAST AFTER LONG TIME WE CATCH THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR
557-129796-0019 TRUE WE MAKE HIM PAY BIG RANSOM FOR GIBRALTAR
557-129796-0020 WE RETURN HERE WITH SOME TWO THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT BUT WHAT IS IT IN REALITY WILL YOU TELL ME OR SHALL I TELL YOU IT IS A PIECE OF CHEESE A PIECE OF CHEESE IN A MOUSETRAP AND WE ARE THE LITTLE MICE GODDAM AND THE CATS OH
557-129796-0021 THE CATS THEY WAIT FOR US THE CATS ARE THOSE FOUR SPANISH SHIPS OF WAR THAT HAVE COME MEANTIME AND THEY WAIT FOR US OUTSIDE THE BOTTLE NECK OF THIS LAGOON
557-129796-0022 WOLVERSTONE LAUGHED CAHUSAC EXPLODED IN FURY
557-129796-0023 CAME AN ANGRY RUMBLE OF APPROVAL THE SINGLE EYE OF THE GIGANTIC WOLVERSTONE ROLLED TERRIBLY AND HE CLENCHED HIS GREAT FISTS AS IF TO STRIKE THE FRENCHMAN WHO WAS EXPOSING THEM TO MUTINY BUT CAHUSAC WAS NOT DAUNTED
557-129796-0024 THE MOOD OF THE MEN ENHEARTENED HIM YOU THINK PERHAPS THIS YOUR CAPTAIN BLOOD IS THE GOOD GOD THAT HE CAN MAKE MIRACLES EH HE IS RIDICULOUS YOU KNOW THIS CAPTAIN BLOOD WITH HIS GRAND AIR AND HIS
557-129796-0025 HE CHECKED OUT OF THE CHURCH AT THAT MOMENT GRAND AIR AND ALL SAUNTERED PETER BLOOD WITH HIM CAME A TOUGH LONG LEGGED FRENCH SEA WOLF NAMED YBERVILLE
557-129796-0026 WHO THOUGH STILL YOUNG HAD ALREADY WON FAME AS A PRIVATEER COMMANDER BEFORE THE LOSS OF HIS OWN SHIP HAD DRIVEN HIM TO TAKE SERVICE UNDER BLOOD THE CAPTAIN ADVANCED TOWARDS THAT DISPUTING GROUP
557-129796-0027 LEANING LIGHTLY UPON HIS LONG EBONY CANE HIS FACE SHADED BY A BROAD PLUMED HAT THERE WAS IN HIS APPEARANCE NOTHING OF THE BUCCANEER HE HAD MUCH MORE THE AIR OF A LOUNGER
557-129796-0028 THE LATTER RATHER SINCE HIS ELEGANT SUIT OF VIOLET TAFFETAS WITH GOLD EMBROIDERED BUTTON HOLES WAS IN THE SPANISH FASHION BUT THE LONG STOUT SERVICEABLE RAPIER THRUST UP BEHIND BY THE LEFT HAND
557-129796-0029 RESTING LIGHTLY ON THE PUMMEL CORRECTED THE IMPRESSION THAT AND THOSE STEELY EYES OF HIS ANNOUNCED THE ADVENTURER YOU FIND ME RIDICULOUS EH CAHUSAC SAID HE AS HE CAME TO A HALT
557-129796-0030 WHAT THEN MUST I FIND YOU HE SPOKE QUIETLY ALMOST WEARILY
557-129796-0031 BUT WHOSE IS THE FAULT OF THAT DELAY WE HAVE BEEN A MONTH IN DOING WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE
557-129796-0032 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE YOU WOULD NOT BE PILOTED YOU KNEW YOUR WAY
557-129796-0033 IN GETTING CANOES TO BRING OFF YOUR MEN AND YOUR GEAR THOSE THREE DAYS GAVE THE FOLK AT GIBRALTAR NOT ONLY TIME TO HEAR OF OUR COMING BUT TIME IN WHICH TO GET AWAY AFTER THAT AND BECAUSE OF IT WE HAD TO FOLLOW THE GOVERNOR TO HIS INFERNAL ISLAND FORTRESS
557-129796-0034 ROUND FROM LA GUAYRA BY A GUARDA COSTA AND IF YE HADN'T LOST LA FOUDRE AND SO REDUCED OUR FLEET FROM THREE SHIPS TO TWO WE SHOULD EVEN NOW BE ABLE TO FIGHT OUR WAY THROUGH WITH A REASONABLE HOPE OF SUCCEEDING YET YOU THINK IT IS FOR YOU TO COME HECTORING HERE
557-129796-0035 HE SPOKE WITH A RESTRAINT WHICH I TRUST YOU WILL AGREE WAS ADMIRABLE WHEN I TELL YOU THAT THE SPANISH FLEET GUARDING THE BOTTLE NECK EXIT OF THE GREAT LAKE OF MARACAYBO AND AWAITING THERE THE COMING FORTH OF CAPTAIN BLOOD
557-129796-0036 WITH A CALM CONFIDENCE BASED UPON ITS OVERWHELMING STRENGTH WAS COMMANDED BY HIS IMPLACABLE ENEMY
557-129796-0037 THE ADMIRAL OF SPAIN IN ADDITION TO HIS DUTY TO HIS COUNTRY THE ADMIRAL HAD AS YOU KNOW A FURTHER PERSONAL INCENTIVE ARISING OUT OF THAT BUSINESS ABOARD THE ENCARNACION A YEAR AGO AND THE DEATH OF HIS BROTHER
557-129796-0038 DON DIEGO AND WITH HIM SAILED HIS NEPHEW ESTEBAN WHOSE VINDICTIVE ZEAL EXCEEDED THE ADMIRAL'S OWN YET KNOWING ALL THIS CAPTAIN BLOOD COULD PRESERVE HIS CALM IN REPROVING THE COWARDLY FRENZY OF ONE FOR WHOM THE SITUATION
557-129796-0039 HAD NOT HALF THE PERIL WITH WHICH IT WAS FRAUGHT FOR HIMSELF HE TURNED FROM CAHUSAC TO ADDRESS THE MOB OF BUCCANEERS WHO HAD SURGED NEARER TO HEAR HIM FOR HE HAD NOT TROUBLED TO RAISE HIS VOICE
557-129796-0040 SURE NOW THERE'S NO QUESTION AT ALL SAID CAPTAIN BLOOD INDEED BUT THERE IS CAHUSAC INSISTED DON MIGUEL THE SPANISH ADMIRAL HAVE OFFER US SAFE PASSAGE TO SEA IF WE WILL DEPART AT ONCE DO NO DAMAGE TO THE TOWN
557-129796-0041 RELEASE OUR PRISONERS AND SURRENDER ALL THAT WE TOOK AT GIBRALTAR CAPTAIN BLOOD SMILED QUIETLY KNOWING PRECISELY HOW MUCH DON MIGUEL'S WORD WAS WORTH IT WAS YBERVILLE WHO REPLIED IN MANIFEST SCORN OF HIS COMPATRIOT
557-129796-0042 BEHIND ENHEARTENED HIM YOU HAVE REFUSE YOU HAVE REFUSE ALREADY AND WITHOUT CONSULTING ME
557-129796-0043 WISH TO AVAIL YOURSELVES OF THE SPANIARD'S TERMS WE SHALL NOT HINDER YOU
557-129796-0044 DON MIGUEL WILL WELCOME YOUR DECISION YOU MAY BE SURE
557-129796-0045 THEN HAVING CONTROLLED HIMSELF
557-129796-0046 PRECISELY WHAT ANSWER HAVE YOU MAKE TO THE ADMIRAL A SMILE IRRADIATED THE FACE AND EYES OF CAPTAIN BLOOD I HAVE ANSWERED HIM THAT UNLESS WITHIN FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS WE HAVE HIS PAROLE TO STAND OUT TO SEA
557-129796-0047 CEASING TO DISPUTE OUR PASSAGE OR HINDER OUR DEPARTURE AND A RANSOM OF FIFTY THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT FOR MARACAYBO WE SHALL REDUCE THIS BEAUTIFUL CITY TO ASHES AND THEREAFTER GO OUT AND DESTROY HIS FLEET
557-129796-0048 THE IMPUDENCE OF IT LEFT CAHUSAC SPEECHLESS
557-129796-0049 EVEN CAHUSAC'S FRENCH FOLLOWERS WERE CARRIED OFF THEIR FEET BY THAT WAVE OF JOCULAR ENTHUSIASM UNTIL IN HIS TRUCULENT OBSTINACY CAHUSAC REMAINED THE ONLY DISSENTIENT HE WITHDREW IN MORTIFICATION
557-129796-0050 NOR WAS HE TO BE MOLLIFIED UNTIL THE FOLLOWING DAY BROUGHT HIM HIS REVENGE THIS CAME IN THE SHAPE OF A MESSENGER FROM DON MIGUEL WITH A LETTER IN WHICH THE SPANISH ADMIRAL SOLEMNLY VOWED TO GOD THAT
557-129796-0051 HE WOULD SO SOON AS HE WAS REENFORCED BY A FIFTH SHIP THE SANTO NINO ON ITS WAY TO JOIN HIM FROM LA GUAYRA HIMSELF COME INSIDE TO SEEK THEM AT MARACAYBO THIS TIME CAPTAIN BLOOD WAS PUT OUT OF TEMPER
557-129796-0052 TROUBLE ME NO MORE HE SNAPPED AT CAHUSAC WHO CAME GROWLING TO HIM AGAIN SEND WORD TO DON MIGUEL
557-129796-0053 THEY HOWEVER WERE TORN BETWEEN GREED AND APPREHENSION IF THEY WENT THEY MUST ABANDON THEIR SHARE OF THE PLUNDER WHICH WAS CONSIDERABLE AS WELL AS THE SLAVES AND OTHER PRISONERS THEY HAD TAKEN IF THEY DID THIS AND CAPTAIN BLOOD
557-129796-0054 SHOULD AFTERWARDS CONTRIVE TO GET AWAY UNSCATHED AND FROM THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF HIS RESOURCEFULNESS THE THING HOWEVER UNLIKELY NEED NOT BE IMPOSSIBLE HE MUST PROFIT BY THAT WHICH THEY NOW RELINQUISHED THIS WAS A CONTINGENCY TOO BITTER FOR CONTEMPLATION
557-129796-0055 AND SO IN THE END DESPITE ALL THAT CAHUSAC COULD SAY THE SURRENDER WAS NOT TO DON MIGUEL BUT TO PETER BLOOD THEY HAD COME INTO THE VENTURE WITH HIM THEY ASSERTED AND THEY WOULD GO OUT OF IT WITH HIM OR NOT AT ALL
557-129796-0056 THAT WAS THE MESSAGE HE RECEIVED FROM THEM THAT SAME EVENING BY THE SULLEN MOUTH OF CAHUSAC HIMSELF HE WELCOMED IT AND INVITED THE BRETON TO SIT DOWN AND JOIN THE COUNCIL WHICH WAS EVEN THEN DELIBERATING UPON THE MEANS TO BE EMPLOYED
557-129796-0057 WHICH CAPTAIN BLOOD HAD APPROPRIATED TO HIS OWN USES A CLOISTERED STONE QUADRANGLE IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH A FOUNTAIN PLAYED COOLLY UNDER A TRELLIS OF VINE ORANGE TREES GREW ON TWO SIDES OF IT
557-129796-0058 AND THE STILL EVENING AIR WAS HEAVY WITH THE SCENT OF THEM IT WAS ONE OF THOSE PLEASANT EXTERIOR INTERIORS WHICH MOORISH ARCHITECTS HAD INTRODUCED TO SPAIN AND THE SPANIARDS HAD CARRIED WITH THEM TO THE NEW WORLD
557-129796-0059 HERE THAT COUNCIL OF WAR COMPOSED OF SIX MEN IN ALL DELIBERATED UNTIL LATE THAT NIGHT UPON THE PLAN OF ACTION WHICH CAPTAIN BLOOD PUT FORWARD THE GREAT FRESHWATER LAKE OF MARACAYBO
557-129796-0060 NOURISHED BY A SCORE OF RIVERS FROM THE SNOW CAPPED RANGES THAT SURROUND IT ON TWO SIDES IS SOME HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES IN LENGTH AND ALMOST THE SAME DISTANCE ACROSS AT ITS WIDEST IT IS AS HAS BEEN INDICATED IN THE SHAPE OF A GREAT BOTTLE
557-129796-0061 HAVING ITS NECK TOWARDS THE SEA AT MARACAYBO BEYOND THIS NECK IT WIDENS AGAIN AND THEN THE TWO LONG NARROW STRIPS OF LAND KNOWN AS THE ISLANDS OF VIGILIAS AND PALOMAS BLOCK THE CHANNEL STANDING LENGTHWISE ACROSS IT
557-129796-0062 BY ANY BUT THE SHALLOWEST CRAFT SAVE AT ITS EASTERN END WHERE COMPLETELY COMMANDING THE NARROW PASSAGE OUT TO SEA STANDS THE MASSIVE FORT WHICH THE BUCCANEERS HAD FOUND DESERTED UPON THEIR COMING IN THE BROADER WATER BETWEEN THIS PASSAGE AND THE BAR
557-129796-0063 THE FOUR SPANISH SHIPS WERE AT ANCHOR IN MID CHANNEL THE ADMIRAL'S ENCARNACION WHICH WE ALREADY KNOW WAS A MIGHTY GALLEON OF FORTY EIGHT GREAT GUNS AND EIGHT SMALL NEXT IN IMPORTANCE WAS THE SALVADOR WITH THIRTY SIX GUNS
557-129796-0064 THOUGH SMALLER VESSELS WERE STILL FORMIDABLE ENOUGH WITH THEIR TWENTY GUNS AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN APIECE SUCH WAS THE FLEET OF WHICH THE GAUNTLET WAS TO BE RUN BY CAPTAIN BLOOD
557-129796-0065 AND TWO SLOOPS CAPTURED AT GIBRALTAR WHICH THEY HAD INDIFFERENTLY ARMED WITH FOUR CULVERINS EACH
557-129796-0066 COMPLACENTLY HE PULLED AT A PIPE THAT WAS LOADED WITH THAT FRAGRANT SACERDOTES TOBACCO FOR WHICH GIBRALTAR WAS FAMOUS AND OF WHICH
557-129796-0067 AND WHAT IS MORE THEY'VE SUCCEEDED
557-129796-0068 BEDAD THEY KNEW THEIR WORLD THE OLD ROMANS HE BREATHED INTO HIS COMPANIONS AND EVEN INTO CAHUSAC SOME OF HIS OWN SPIRIT OF CONFIDENCE AND IN CONFIDENCE ALL WENT BUSILY TO WORK FOR THREE DAYS FROM SUNRISE TO SUNSET
557-129796-0069 THE BUCCANEERS LABOURED AND SWEATED TO COMPLETE THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE ACTION THAT WAS TO PROCURE THEM THEIR DELIVERANCE TIME PRESSED THEY MUST STRIKE BEFORE DON MIGUEL DE ESPINOSA
557-129796-0070 WHICH WAS COMING TO JOIN HIM FROM LA GUAYRA THEIR PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS WERE ON THE LARGER OF THE TWO SLOOPS CAPTURED AT GIBRALTAR TO WHICH VESSEL WAS ASSIGNED THE LEADING PART IN CAPTAIN BLOOD'S SCHEME THEY BEGAN BY TEARING DOWN ALL BULKHEADS
557-129796-0071 NEXT THEY INCREASED BY A HALF DOZEN THE SCUTTLES IN HER DECK WHILST INTO HER HULL THEY PACKED ALL THE TAR AND PITCH AND BRIMSTONE THAT THEY COULD FIND IN THE TOWN TO WHICH THEY ADDED SIX BARRELS OF GUNPOWDER PLACED ON END LIKE GUNS
557-129796-0072 AT THE OPEN PORTS ON HER LARBOARD SIDE ON THE EVENING OF THE FOURTH DAY EVERYTHING BEING NOW IN READINESS ALL WERE GOT ABOARD AND THE EMPTY PLEASANT CITY OF MARACAYBO WAS AT LAST ABANDONED BUT THEY DID NOT WEIGH ANCHOR UNTIL SOME TWO HOURS AFTER MIDNIGHT
557-129796-0073 THEN AT LAST ON THE FIRST OF THE EBB THEY DRIFTED SILENTLY DOWN TOWARDS THE BAR WITH ALL CANVAS FURLED SAVE ONLY THEIR SPILTSAILS WHICH SO AS TO GIVE THEM STEERING WAY WERE SPREAD TO THE FAINT BREEZE
557-129796-0074 THAT STIRRED THROUGH THE PURPLE DARKNESS OF THE TROPICAL NIGHT
557-129796-0075 AHEAD WENT THE IMPROVISED FIRE SHIP IN CHARGE OF WOLVERSTONE WITH A CREW OF SIX VOLUNTEERS EACH OF WHOM WAS TO HAVE A HUNDRED PIECES OF EIGHT OVER AND ABOVE HIS SHARE OF PLUNDER AS A SPECIAL REWARD NEXT CAME THE ARABELLA
557-129796-0076 SHE WAS FOLLOWED AT A DISTANCE BY THE ELIZABETH COMMANDED BY HAGTHORPE WITH WHOM WAS THE NOW SHIPLESS CAHUSAC AND THE BULK OF HIS FRENCH FOLLOWERS
557-129796-0077 AND SOME EIGHT CANOES ABOARD OF WHICH HAD BEEN SHIPPED THE PRISONERS THE SLAVES AND MOST OF THE CAPTURED MERCHANDISE THE PRISONERS WERE ALL PINIONED AND GUARDED BY FOUR BUCCANEERS WITH MUSKETOONS
557-129796-0078 WHO MANNED THESE BOATS IN ADDITION TO THE TWO FELLOWS WHO WERE TO SAIL THEM THEIR PLACE WAS TO BE IN THE REAR
557-129796-0079 IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THEY USED A VIGILANCE KEENER THAN THEIR CARELESS HABIT CERTAIN IT IS THAT THEY DID NOT SIGHT BLOOD'S FLEET IN THAT DIM LIGHT
557-129796-0080 JUST AS THE SLIGHT VESSEL WENT CRASHING AND BUMPING AND SCRAPING AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE FLAGSHIP WHILST RIGGING BECAME TANGLED WITH RIGGING
557-129796-0081 HIS SIX MEN STOOD AT THEIR POSTS ON THE LARBOARD SIDE STARK NAKED EACH ARMED WITH A GRAPNEL FOUR OF THEM ON THE GUNWALE TWO OF THEM ALOFT AT THE MOMENT OF IMPACT THESE GRAPNELS WERE SLUNG TO BIND THE SPANIARD TO THEM
557-129796-0082 ABOARD THE RUDELY AWAKENED GALLEON ALL WAS CONFUSED HURRYING SCURRYING TRUMPETING AND SHOUTING AT FIRST THERE HAD BEEN A DESPERATELY HURRIED ATTEMPT TO GET UP THE ANCHOR BUT THIS WAS ABANDONED AS BEING ALREADY TOO LATE
557-129796-0083 AND CONCEIVING THEMSELVES ON THE POINT OF BEING BOARDED THE SPANIARDS STOOD TO ARMS TO WARD OFF THE ONSLAUGHT ITS SLOWNESS IN COMING INTRIGUED THEM
557-129796-0084 AND THEN ONE OF THEIR OFFICERS RENDERED RECKLESS BY PANIC
557-129796-0085 THE NEAREST GAPING SCUTTLE INTO THE HOLD AND THEREUPON DIVED OVERBOARD IN HIS TURN TO BE PICKED UP PRESENTLY BY THE LONGBOAT FROM THE ARABELLA BUT BEFORE THAT HAPPENED THE SLOOP WAS A THING OF FIRE FROM WHICH EXPLOSIONS WERE HURLING BLAZING COMBUSTIBLES
557-129796-0086 AND LONG TONGUES OF FLAME WERE LICKING OUT TO CONSUME THE GALLEON BEATING BACK THOSE DARING SPANIARDS WHO TOO LATE
557-129796-0087 BLOOD HAD SAILED IN TO OPEN FIRE UPON THE SALVADOR FIRST ATHWART HER HAWSE HE HAD LOOSED A BROADSIDE THAT HAD SWEPT HER DECKS WITH TERRIFIC EFFECT THEN GOING ON AND ABOUT
557-129796-0088 HE HAD PUT A SECOND BROADSIDE INTO HER HULL AT SHORT RANGE LEAVING HER THUS HALF CRIPPLED TEMPORARILY AT LEAST AND KEEPING TO HIS COURSE HE HAD BEWILDERED THE CREW OF THE INFANTA BY A COUPLE OF SHOTS FROM THE CHASERS ON HIS BEAK HEAD
557-129796-0089 THEN CRASHED ALONGSIDE TO GRAPPLE AND BOARD HER WHILST HAGTHORPE WAS DOING THE LIKE BY THE SAN FELIPE AND IN ALL THIS TIME NOT A SINGLE SHOT HAD THE SPANIARDS CONTRIVED TO FIRE SO COMPLETELY HAD THEY BEEN TAKEN BY SURPRISE
557-129796-0090 AND SO SWIFT AND PARALYZING HAD BEEN BLOOD'S STROKE BOARDED NOW AND FACED BY THE COLD STEEL OF THE BUCCANEERS
557-129796-0091 OFFERED MUCH RESISTANCE THE SIGHT OF THEIR ADMIRAL IN FLAMES AND THE SALVADOR DRIFTING CRIPPLED FROM THE ACTION HAD SO UTTERLY DISHEARTENED THEM THAT THEY ACCOUNTED THEMSELVES VANQUISHED AND LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS IF BY A RESOLUTE STAND THE SALVADOR
557-129796-0092 HAD ENCOURAGED THE OTHER TWO UNDAMAGED VESSELS TO RESISTANCE THE SPANIARDS MIGHT WELL HAVE RETRIEVED THE FORTUNES OF THE DAY BUT IT HAPPENED THAT THE SALVADOR WAS HANDICAPPED IN TRUE SPANISH FASHION BY BEING THE TREASURE SHIP OF THE FLEET
557-129796-0093 INTENT ABOVE ALL UPON SAVING THIS FROM FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF THE PIRATES DON MIGUEL WHO WITH A REMNANT OF HIS CREW HAD MEANWHILE TRANSFERRED HIMSELF ABOARD HER HEADED HER DOWN TOWARDS PALOMAS AND THE FORT THAT GUARDED THE PASSAGE
557-129796-0094 THIS FORT THE ADMIRAL IN THOSE DAYS OF WAITING HAD TAKEN THE PRECAUTION SECRETLY TO GARRISON AND REARM FOR THE PURPOSE HE HAD STRIPPED THE FORT OF COJERO FARTHER OUT ON THE GULF OF ITS ENTIRE ARMAMENT
557-129796-0095 WHICH INCLUDED SOME CANNON ROYAL OF MORE THAN ORDINARY RANGE AND POWER WITH NO SUSPICION OF THIS CAPTAIN BLOOD GAVE CHASE ACCOMPANIED BY THE INFANTA WHICH WAS MANNED NOW BY A PRIZE CREW UNDER THE COMMAND OF YBERVILLE
557-129796-0096 THE STERN CHASERS OF THE SALVADOR DESULTORILY
557-129796-0097 BUT SUCH WAS THE DAMAGE SHE HERSELF SUSTAINED THAT PRESENTLY COMING UNDER THE GUNS OF THE FORT SHE BEGAN TO SINK AND FINALLY SETTLED DOWN IN THE SHALLOWS WITH PART OF HER HULL ABOVE WATER THENCE SOME IN BOATS AND SOME BY SWIMMING
557-129796-0098 THE ADMIRAL GOT HIS CREW ASHORE ON PALOMAS AS BEST HE COULD AND THEN JUST AS CAPTAIN BLOOD ACCOUNTED THE VICTORY WON AND THAT HIS WAY OUT OF THAT TRAP TO THE OPEN SEA BEYOND LAY CLEAR THE FORT SUDDENLY REVEALED ITS FORMIDABLE
557-129796-0099 AND UTTERLY UNSUSPECTED STRENGTH WITH A ROAR THE CANNONS ROYAL PROCLAIMED THEMSELVES AND THE ARABELLA STAGGERED UNDER A BLOW THAT SMASHED HER BULWARKS AT THE WAIST AND SCATTERED DEATH AND CONFUSION AMONG THE SEAMEN GATHERED THERE
557-129796-0100 HAD NOT PITT HER MASTER HIMSELF SEIZED THE WHIPSTAFF AND PUT THE HELM HARD OVER TO SWING HER SHARPLY OFF TO STARBOARD SHE MUST HAVE SUFFERED STILL WORSE FROM THE SECOND VOLLEY THAT FOLLOWED FAST UPON THE FIRST
557-129796-0101 ALTHOUGH HIT BY ONE SHOT ONLY THIS HAD CRUSHED HER LARBOARD TIMBERS ON THE WATERLINE STARTING A LEAK THAT MUST PRESENTLY HAVE FILLED HER BUT FOR THE PROMPT ACTION OF THE EXPERIENCED YBERVILLE IN ORDERING HER LARBOARD GUNS TO BE FLUNG OVERBOARD
557-129796-0102 THUS LIGHTENED AND LISTING NOW TO STARBOARD HE FETCHED HER ABOUT
557-129796-0103 WHICH DID THEM HOWEVER LITTLE FURTHER DAMAGE OUT OF RANGE AT LAST THEY LAY TO
