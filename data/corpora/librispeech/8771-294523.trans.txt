8771-294523-0000 THE BUSINESS OFFICE OF A SCOTCH SOLICITOR IS NOT AN ESPECIALLY CHEERFUL PLACE AT ANY TIME AND THE INTERIOR OF SUCH A ROOM LOOKED PARTICULARLY CHEERLESS ON A LATE WINTER AFTERNOON IN EDINBURGH IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SIX A BOY OF FIFTEEN
8771-294523-0001 SAT ON A HIGH STOOL AT AN OLD OAK DESK AND WATCHED THE SNOW FALLING IN THE STREET OCCASIONALLY
8771-294523-0002 THAT THE BOY COULD HEAR IT AND THE COLD WAS BITTER THE BOY LOOKED THROUGH THE WINDOW UNTIL HE ALMOST FELT THE CHILL HIMSELF AND THEN TO KEEP WARM HELD HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND FASTENED HIS EYES ON THE BIG HEAVY LEAVED BOOK IN FRONT OF HIM
8771-294523-0003 WHICH BORE THE UNAPPEALING TITLE ERSKINE'S INSTITUTES
8771-294523-0004 SOMETIMES HIS EYES WOULD INVOLUNTARILY CLOSE AND HE WOULD DOZE A FEW MOMENTS ONLY TO WAKE WITH A START TO LOOK QUICKLY AT ANOTHER DESK NEAR THE FIRE WHERE HIS FATHER SAT STEADILY WRITING
8771-294523-0005 HE CLOSED THE BOOK WITH A BANG FATHER YES WALTER LAD THE LAWYER LOOKED UP FROM HIS WRITING AND SMILED AT THE FIGURE ON THE HIGH STOOL I'D BEST BE GOING HOME THERE'S NO MORE LIGHT HERE TO SEE BY A GOOD REASON WALTER
8771-294523-0006 WRAP YOURSELF UP WARM FOR THE NIGHT IS COLD YOUNG WALTER SLID DOWN FROM HIS SEAT
8771-294523-0007 HE WAS A STURDY WELL BUILT LAD WITH TOUSLED YELLOW HAIR
8771-294523-0008 WHEN HE WALKED HE LIMPED BUT HE HELD HIMSELF SO STRAIGHT THAT WHEN HE WAS STILL NO ONE WOULD HAVE NOTICED THE DEFORMITY FIVE MINUTES LATER THE BOY WAS PLOWING HIS WAY THROUGH THE NARROW STREETS OF THE CANONGATE
8771-294523-0009 THE OLD PART OF EDINBURGH THAT HAD AS ANCIENT A HISTORY OF STREET BRAWLS AS THE PARIS KENNELS NOBODY WHO COULD HELP IT WAS ABROAD AND WALTER WAS GLAD WHEN HE REACHED THE DOOR OF HIS FATHER'S HOUSE IN GEORGE'S SQUARE AND COULD FIND SHELTER FROM THE CUTTING WIND
8771-294523-0010 THE SCOTCH EVENING MEAL WAS SIMPLE SOON OVER AND THEN CAME THE TIME TO SIT BEFORE THE BLAZING LOGS ON THE GREAT OPEN HEARTH AND TELL STORIES THE OLDER PEOPLE WERE BUSY AT CARDS IN ANOTHER ROOM
8771-294523-0011 AND WALTER WITH A GROUP OF BOYS OF HIS OWN AGE WHO LIVED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND LIKED TO BE WITH THE LAME LAD HAD THE FIRESIDE TO THEMSELVES IN FRONT OF THE FIRE YOUNG WALTER WAS NO LONGER THE SLEEPY STUDENT OF ERSKINE'S INSTITUTES
8771-294523-0012 HALF OF THEM FOUNDED ON OLD BALLADS OR LEGENDS HE KNEW BY HEART AND HALF THE PRODUCT OF HIS OWN EAGER IMAGINATION WHOLE POEMS FILLED WITH BATTLES AND HUNTS AND KNIGHTLY ADVENTURES HE COULD RECITE FROM MEMORY
8771-294523-0013 AND HIS EYE FOR THE COLOR AND TRAPPINGS OF HISTORY WAS SO KEEN THAT THE BOYS COULD SEE THE VERY SCENES BEFORE THEM THEY SAT IN A CIRCLE ABOUT HIM LISTENING EAGERLY TO STORY AFTER STORY FORGETTING EVERYTHING BUT THE BOY'S WORDS
8771-294523-0014 AND SHOWING THEIR FONDNESS AND ADMIRATION FOR THE ROMANCER IN EACH GLANCE WALTER WAS MINSTREL AND PROPHET AND HISTORIAN TO THE BOYS OF THE CANONGATE BY THE WINTER FIRE AS HE WAS TO BE LATER TO THE WHOLE NATION OF ENGLISHMEN
8771-294523-0015 BY THE NEXT DAY THE SNOW HAD CEASED FALLING AND THE OPEN SQUARES OF THE CITY PRESENTED THE FINEST MIMIC BATTLE FIELDS THAT COULD BE IMAGINED
8771-294523-0016 AND CARRIED ON CONSTANT WARFARE AS LONG AS WINTER LASTED WALTER SCOTT AND HIS BROTHERS BELONGED TO A CLAN THAT MADE GEORGE'S SQUARE THEIR HEADQUARTERS AND THEIR NEAREST AND DEAREST ENEMIES WERE THE BOYS OF THE CROSSCAUSEWAY
8771-294523-0017 A POORER SECTION OF THE CITY THAT LAY NOT VERY FAR DISTANT ON THE DAY THE STORM CEASED WALTER LEFT HIS HIGH STOOL AND PONDEROUS BOOK EARLY AND JOINED HIS FRIENDS IN SOLID ARRAY IN THEIR SQUARE
8771-294523-0018 WHILE THEY WAITED FOR THE ENEMY TO COME UP FROM THE SIDE STREET THE BOYS BUILT SNOW FORTIFICATIONS ACROSS THE SQUARE AND STOCKED THEM WITH AMMUNITION SUFFICIENT TO STAND A SIEGE STILL NO ENEMY APPEARED AND EAGER FOR A CHANCE TO TRY THEIR AIM
8771-294523-0019 THE BOYS OF THE SQUARE BOLDLY LEFT THEIR OWN HAUNTS AND PROCEEDED DOWN THE CROSSCAUSEWAY IN SEARCH OF THE FOE THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY LAY THROUGH NARROW WINDING STREETS AND THERE WAS GREAT NEED OF CARE TO AVOID AN AMBUSCADE
8771-294523-0020 SLIPPING FROM DOOR TO DOOR FROM ONE POINT OF VANTAGE TO THE NEXT THE BOYS MADE THE WHOLE DISTANCE OF THE ENEMY'S LAND WITHOUT SIGHT OF AN ENEMY THEY CAME TO THE FURTHER BOUNDARY AND RAISED A CHEER OF DEFIANCE WHEN SUDDENLY
8771-294523-0021 A HAIL STORM OF SNOWBALLS STRUCK THEM
8771-294523-0022 THE INVADERS FIRED ONE ROUND THEN TURNED AND FLED BEFORE A FIERCE CHARGE BACK THE WAY THEY CAME THE BOYS RETREATED AND AFTER THEM CAME THE ENEMY PELTING THEM WITHOUT MERCY AND WITH GOOD AIM
8771-294523-0023 IN THE VAN OF THE PURSUIT RAN A TALL FAIR HAIRED BOY WHO WORE THE BRIGHT GREEN BREECHES OF A TAILOR'S CLERK WHO WAS FAMOUS FOR HIS PROWESS IN THESE SCHOOLBOY BATTLES AND WHO BECAUSE OF HIS CLOTHES HAD BEEN GIVEN THE PICTURESQUE NICKNAME OF GREEN BREEKS
8771-294523-0024 YOUNG SCOTT AND HIS FRIENDS RAN BACK INTO THEIR SQUARE BUT THE ENEMY WERE CLOSE UPON THEIR HEELS GREEN BREEKS WAS NOW FAR IN THE LEAD OF HIS FORCES SO FAR IN THE LEAD THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CUT OFF HAD NOT THE PURSUED BEEN PANIC STRICKEN
8771-294523-0025 OVER THEIR OWN FORTIFICATIONS THE BOYS FLED AND DROPPED BEHIND THEM FOR SAFETY THEIR BANNER A FLAG GIVEN THEM BY A LADY OF THE SQUARE
8771-294523-0026 THE TALL BOY LEAPED UPON THE RAMPART AND SEIZED THE STANDARD WHEN A BLOW FROM A STICK BROUGHT HIM TO THE GROUND HE FELL STUNNED AND THE BLOOD POURED FROM A CUT IN HIS HEAD
8771-294523-0027 BUT NOT TO SUCH AN ENDING TO THEM HE HURRIED OVER TO THE FALLEN GREEN BREEKS AND THE BOYS OF BOTH ARMIES MELTED SILENTLY AWAY SHORTLY AFTER GREEN BREEKS WAS IN THE HOSPITAL HIS HEAD BANDAGED BUT OTHERWISE LITTLE THE WORSE FOR HIS MISHAP
8771-294523-0028 AND LOSS OF TIME IN THE TAILOR'S SHOP
8771-294523-0029 AND NONE OF EITHER PARTY COULD BE FOUND TO TELL WHEN THE WOUNDED LEADER HEARD OF WALTER'S OFFER HE REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE MONEY ON THE GROUND THAT SUCH ACCIDENTS WERE APT TO HAPPEN TO ANY ONE IN BATTLE AND THAT HE DID NOT NEED THE MONEY
8771-294523-0030 AND RECEIVED THE ANSWER THAT HE LIVED WITH HIS AGED GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS VERY FOND OF TAKING SNUFF THEREUPON WALTER PRESENTED THE OLD WOMAN WITH A POUND OF SNUFF AND AS SOON AS GREEN BREEKS WAS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL MADE HIM ONE OF HIS FRIENDS WITH THE OPENING OF SPRING
8771-294523-0031 WALTER SPENT ALL HIS SPARE HOURS IN HIS FAVORITE PURSUIT RIDING THROUGH THE COUNTRY ON A SEARCH FOR OLD LEGENDS OR CURIOUS TALES OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCOTTISH HISTORY WAS HIS NEVER ENDING DELIGHT
8771-294523-0032 AND COULD TELL HOW THE ARMIES HAD COME TO MEET AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT STORIES OF SPRITES AND GOBLINS OF WITCHES AND MAGICIANS WERE EAGERLY SOUGHT BY HIM MANY AN OLD WOMAN WAS LED TO TELL THE LAME BOY WITH THE EAGER EYES THE TALES SHE HAD HEARD AS A SCHOOLGIRL
8771-294523-0033 AND THE HARDER THE NOOKS WERE TO REACH THE BETTER THEY LIKED THEM WALTER IN SPITE OF HIS LAMENESS WAS A GOOD CLIMBER AND TIME AND AGAIN WHEN IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THEY HAD CONTRIVED TO GET INTO A PLACE FROM WHICH THERE WAS NO WAY OUT
8771-294523-0034 HE WOULD MANAGE TO DISCOVER SOME JUTTING STONE OR CREVICE IN THE ROCK THAT ALLOWED THEM FINALLY TO MAKE A PERILOUS ESCAPE THAT SORT OF ADVENTURE APPEALED TO THE BOY TREMENDOUSLY
8771-294523-0035 AS THE HEROES OF HIS STORIES SO OFTEN HAD TO DO THE BOYS DEVOURED A GREAT MANY BOOKS IN THESE EXPEDITIONS
8771-294523-0036 AND WALTER SO MASTERED THE PAGES THAT HE READ THAT HE COULD RECITE LONG PASSAGES FROM THEM TO HIS FRIEND WEEKS AFTER THEY HAD FINISHED THE STORIES FINALLY THEY FELL INTO THE HABIT OF MAKING UP STORIES OF KNIGHTS FOR THEMSELVES
8771-294523-0037 FIRST WALTER TELLING THE ADVENTURES OF A KNIGHT TO JOHN AND LEAVING THE HERO IN SOME VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR JOHN TO RESCUE HIM FROM AND THEN JOHN CARRYING ON THE STORY WITH ANOTHER ADVENTURE AND LEAVING THE NEXT RESCUE TO HIS FRIEND
8771-294523-0038 THE STORIES WENT ON FROM DAY TO DAY AND WEEK TO WEEK BECAUSE THE BOYS GREW SO FOND OF THEIR HEROES THAT NEITHER HAD THE HEART TO KILL THE BRAVE KNIGHT AND THEY COULD FIND NO OTHER WAY TO BRING HIS ADVENTURES TO AN END ALTHOUGH WALTER SPENT CONSIDERABLE TIME IN HIS FATHER'S OFFICE
8771-294523-0039 HE WAS STILL STUDYING UNDER A TUTOR WITH OTHER BOYS PREPARING FOR COLLEGE HE WAS A BRILLIANT SCHOLAR WHEN HE WANTED TO BE BUT ALL SUBJECTS DID NOT INTEREST HIM AT ONE TIME THERE WAS A CERTAIN BOY WHO ALWAYS STOOD AT THE TOP OF WALTER'S CLASS
8771-294523-0040 WHOM YOUNG SCOTT COULD NOT SUPPLANT TRY AS HE WOULD FINALLY WALTER NOTICED THAT WHENEVER THE MASTER ASKED THAT BOY A QUESTION THE LATTER ALWAYS FUMBLED WITH HIS FINGERS AT A CERTAIN BUTTON ON THE LOWER PART OF HIS WAISTCOAT
8771-294523-0041 WALTER SCOTT THEREUPON DETERMINED TO CUT OFF THAT PARTICULAR BUTTON AND SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN HE FOUND A CHANCE SOON AFTER AND CUT OFF THE BUTTON WITH A KNIFE WHILE THE OWNER OF THE COAT WAS NOT LOOKING
8771-294523-0042 THEN WALTER WAITED WITH THE GREATEST INTEREST TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THE NEXT TIME THE MASTER ASKED QUESTIONS OF THE YOUTH AT THE HEAD OF THE CLASS WALTER SAW THE BOY'S FINGERS FEEL FOR THE BUTTON
8771-294523-0043 WHEN HE SAW IT WAS MISSING HE GREW CONFUSED STAMMERED MUTTERED TO HIMSELF AND COULD NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION WALTER CAME NEXT AND BEING ABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION TOOK THE OTHER BOY'S PLACE CHUCKLING TO HIMSELF
8771-294523-0044 HE DID NOT HOLD IT LONG HE HAD SIMPLY WISHED TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
8771-294523-0045 WHO WAS REALLY THE BETTER SCHOLAR IN A THOUSAND WAYS WALTER SHOWED HIS LOVE OF HISTORY AND ROMANCE ANYTHING THAT WAS PICTURESQUE WHETHER IT WAS A VIEW OR AN OLD DIRK CAUGHT HIS ATTENTION AT ONCE
8771-294523-0046 FOR A SHORT TIME HE TOOK LESSONS IN OIL PAINTING FROM A GERMAN HE SOON FOUND THAT HE HAD NOT THE EYE NOR THE HAND FOR THE WORK BUT IT HAPPENED THAT THE TEACHER'S FATHER HAD BEEN A SOLDIER IN THE ARMY OF FREDERICK THE GREAT AND AS SOON AS WALTER FOUND THIS OUT
8771-294523-0047 HE PLIED THE MAN WITH QUESTIONS LONG AFTERWARD HE SAID HE VIVIDLY REMEMBERED THE MAN'S PICTURESQUE ACCOUNT OF SEEING A PARTY OF THE FAMOUS BLACK HUSSARS
8771-294523-0048 WITH THE WOUNDED COSSACKS THEMSELVES LYING HIGH UP ON THE PILES OF STRAW OFTEN IN GOOD WEATHER THE BOYS OF GEORGE'S SQUARE WOULD GO ON LONG EXCURSIONS INTO THE COUNTRY FREQUENTLY STAYING AWAY FROM HOME FOR SEVERAL DAYS AT A TIME
8771-294523-0049 ON ONE SUCH OCCASION THEY FOUND THEMSELVES SOME TWENTY MILES AWAY FROM EDINBURGH WITHOUT A SINGLE SIXPENCE LEFT AMONG THEM WALTER SAID AFTERWARD WE WERE CERTAINLY PUT TO OUR SHIFTS BUT WE ASKED EVERY NOW AND THEN
8771-294523-0050 AT A COTTAGE DOOR FOR A DRINK OF WATER AND ONE OR TWO OF THE GOOD WIVES OBSERVING OUR WORN OUT LOOKS BROUGHT OUT MILK IN PLACE OF WATER SO WITH THAT AND HIPS AND HAWS WE CAME IN LITTLE THE WORSE HIS FATHER WAS NOT AT ALL PLEASED WITH HIS LONG ABSENCE
8771-294523-0051 AND ASKED HOW HE HAD MANAGED WITH SO LITTLE MONEY PRETTY MUCH LIKE THE RAVENS SAID THE BOY I ONLY WISHED I HAD BEEN AS GOOD A PLAYER ON THE FLUTE
8771-294523-0052 IF I HAD HIS ART I SHOULD LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO TRAMP LIKE HIM FROM COTTAGE TO COTTAGE OVER THE WORLD
8771-294523-0053 IT MAY BE THAT AS A RESULT OF THESE CHANCE EXPEDITIONS WALTER'S FATHER FINALLY CAME TO REALIZE THAT THE BOY MIGHT BE MADE USE OF IN CERTAIN LEGAL BUSINESS THAT REQUIRED SENDING MESSENGERS INTO THE HIGHLANDS
8771-294523-0054 SOON HE WAS SENT WITH SOME LEGAL PAPERS TO THE MACLARENS WHO LIVED IN THAT BEAUTIFUL LAKE COUNTRY ABOUT LOCH LOMOND WHICH SCOTT
8771-294523-0055 AND THE CHANGING PANORAMA UNROLLED BEFORE HIS EYES LIKE A LAND OF DREAMS IT HAPPENED THAT WALTER WAS TRAVELING IN THE COMPANY OF A SERGEANT AND SIX MEN FROM A HIGHLAND REGIMENT STATIONED IN STERLING
8771-294523-0056 AND SO HE JOURNEYED QUITE LIKE SOME ANCIENT CHIEFTAIN WITH A FRONT AND REAR GUARD AND BEARING ARMS THE SERGEANT WAS A THOROUGH HIGHLANDER FULL OF STORIES OF ROB ROY AND OF HIS OWN EARLY ADVENTURES AND AN EXCELLENT COMPANION
8771-294523-0057 THE TRIP WAS A GREAT SUCCESS AND FIRED WALTER'S DESIRES TO SEE MORE OF A COUNTRY WHICH EVEN THEN WAS ONLY HALF CIVILIZED A LITTLE LATER HE HAD ANOTHER CHANCE BEING SENT NORTH TO VISIT ANOTHER OF HIS FATHER'S CLIENTS AN OLD JACOBITE
8771-294523-0058 WHO HAD FOUGHT IN THE UPRISINGS OF SEVENTEEN FIFTEEN AND SEVENTEEN FORTY FIVE
8771-294523-0059 AND WALTER HAD THE SATISFACTION OF SEEING THE OLD JACOBITE CHIEF MAKING READY TO BEAR ARMS AGAIN AND HEARD HIM EXULT AT THE PROSPECT OF DRAWING CLAYMORE ONCE MORE BEFORE HE DIED THE BOY WAS SO DELIGHTED AT THE STORIES THE OLD MAN TOLD
8771-294523-0060 AND SO HE SPENT HIS HOLIDAY WITH HIM RIDING NORTHWARD ON THIS VISIT THE VALE OF PERTH FIRST BURST ON HIS VIEW LONG AFTERWARD HE DESCRIBED THE TREMENDOUS IMPRESSION THIS SIGHT MADE UPON HIM I RECOLLECT PULLING UP THE REINS HE WROTE LATER
8771-294523-0061 WITHOUT MEANING TO DO SO AND GAZING ON THE SCENE BEFORE ME AS IF I HAD BEEN AFRAID IT WOULD SHIFT LIKE THOSE IN A THEATRE BEFORE I COULD DISTINCTLY OBSERVE ITS DIFFERENT PARTS OR CONVINCE MYSELF THAT WHAT I SAW WAS REAL
8771-294523-0062 EVEN AS HE REMEMBERED SO VIVIDLY THE TALES THE OLD MEN AND WOMEN HAD TOLD HIM WHEN HE WAS A VERY LITTLE BOY THE STORIES OF HIS GRANDMOTHER OF BORDER WARFARE OF HEROES OF SCOTLAND SUCH AS WATT OF HARDEN AND WIGHT WILLIE OF
8771-294523-0063 MERRYMEN MUCH LIKE ROBIN HOOD AND LITTLE JOHN AND AS HE REMEMBERED THE ROMANCES HE AND HIS FRIEND HAD READ IN THE HILLS
8771-294523-0064 HE WAS GROWING TO KNOW SCOTLAND AS NO OTHER MAN HAD EVER KNOWN IT THE BOY WALTER HAD LITTLE KNOWLEDGE THEN OF THE GREAT USE TO WHICH HE WAS LATER TO PUT HIS LOVE OF SCOTTISH HISTORY HE EXPECTED TO BE A LAWYER AND WAS STUDYING TO THAT END
8771-294523-0065 BUT ALL HIS SPARE MOMENTS WERE SPENT IN HUNTING LEGENDS OF HIS LAND HE BECAME EAGER TO VISIT THE THEN WILD AND INACCESSIBLE REGION OF LIDDESDALE SO THAT HE MIGHT SEE THE RUINS OF THE FAMOUS CASTLE OF THE HERMITAGE
8771-294523-0066 AND TRY TO PICK UP SOME OF THE ANCIENT RIDING BALLADS AS THEY WERE CALLED SONGS WHICH WERE SAID TO BE STILL PRESERVED AMONG THE DESCENDANTS OF THE OLD MOSS TROOPERS
8771-294523-0067 WHEN THEY WERE LORDS OF THAT REMOTE CASTLE HE FOUND A MAN WHO KNEW THAT RUGGED COUNTRY WELL AND FOR SEVEN SUCCESSIVE YEARS WALTER SCOTT MADE A RAID AS HE CALLED IT INTO THAT COUNTRY
8771-294523-0068 FOLLOWING EACH STREAM TO ITS SOURCE AND STUDYING EVERY RUINED TOWER OR CASTLE FROM FOUNDATION STONE TO TOPMOST BATTLEMENT
8771-294523-0069 BUT EVERYWHERE THEY MET WITH OPEN WELCOME AND FROM EACH HOME THEY GATHERED SONGS AND STORIES AND SOMETIMES RELICS OF BORDER WARS TO TAKE BACK WITH THEM TO EDINBURGH EVEN THEN THE YOUTH HAD LITTLE NOTION OF WHAT HE SHOULD DO
8771-294523-0070 THE FRIEND HE TRAVELED WITH SAID LATER
8771-294523-0071 AT FIRST HE THOUGHT O LITTLE I DARE SAY BUT THE QUEERNESS AND THE FUN IN COURSE OF TIME SCOTT WAS CALLED TO THE BAR AS A LAWYER AND TOOK HIS PLACE WITH THE DOZENS OF YOUNG MEN WHO HUNG ABOUT THE PARLIAMENT HOUSE IN EDINBURGH
8771-294523-0072 WAITING FOR BRIEFS OF CASES TO BE ARGUED THERE WERE LOTS OF DEBATING CLUBS IN THE SCOTCH CAPITAL AT THAT TIME AND SCOTT WAS A MEMBER OF SEVERAL SOME TIME WAS SPENT IN ARGUMENT BUT MORE IN TELLING STORIES AND IN SINGING SONGS
8771-294523-0073 HERE THE YOUNG LAWYER RULED SUPREME NO OTHER MAN COULD TELL SUCH TALES AS HE AND NONE KNEW SO MANY AND SUCH CURIOUS SONGS
8771-294523-0074 DRESSING THEM UP TO SUIT HIS TASTE ONCE A FRIEND COMPLAINED THAT HE HAD CHANGED A STORY TOLD HIM THE DAY BEFORE
8771-294523-0075 I ONLY PUT A COCKED HAT ON THEIR HEADS AND STICK A CANE INTO THEIR HANDS TO MAKE THEM FIT FOR GOING INTO COMPANY FIFTEEN YEARS PASSED AND ALL ENGLAND WAS READING EAGERLY THE WONDERFUL HISTORICAL POEMS AND ROMANCES WRITTEN BY A MAN
8771-294523-0076 ITS PEOPLE COLD AND UNINVITING SUDDENLY ALL THAT WAS CHANGED
8771-294523-0077 FILLED WITH POETRY A COUNTRY FULL OF GLORIOUS SCENERY A PEOPLE DESCENDED FROM A LINE OF KINGS EVEN THE NARROW STREETS OF EDINBURGH AND THE OLD CANONGATE ITSELF BECAME HISTORIC GROUND UNDER THE WIZARD'S SPELL THE WIZARD WAS WALTER SCOTT
8771-294523-0078 AND NOW HE FOUND THE WHOLE WORLD AS EAGER TO HEAR THE STORIES AND POEMS HE HAD TO TELL ABOUT HIS COUNTRY
