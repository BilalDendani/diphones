1569-141082-0001 HOLMES'S FACE SHOWED HIS DISAPPOINTMENT AND ANNOYANCE WELL WELL WE CAN'T EXPECT TO HAVE IT ALL OUR OWN WAY WATSON HE SAID AT LAST WE MUST COME BACK IN THE AFTERNOON IF MISTER HARDING WILL NOT BE HERE UNTIL THEN I AM AS YOU HAVE NO DOUBT SURMISED
1569-141082-0002 ENDEAVOURING TO TRACE THESE BUSTS TO THEIR SOURCE IN ORDER TO FIND IF THERE IS NOT SOMETHING PECULIAR WHICH MAY ACCOUNT FOR THEIR REMARKABLE FATE LET US MAKE FOR MISTER MORSE HUDSON OF THE KENNINGTON ROAD AND SEE IF HE CAN THROW ANY LIGHT UPON THE PROBLEM
1569-141082-0003 A DRIVE OF AN HOUR BROUGHT US TO THE PICTURE DEALER'S ESTABLISHMENT HE WAS A SMALL STOUT MAN WITH A RED FACE AND A PEPPERY MANNER YES SIR ON MY VERY COUNTER SIR SAID HE WHAT WE PAY RATES AND TAXES FOR I DON'T KNOW WHEN ANY RUFFIAN CAN COME IN AND BREAK ONE'S GOODS
1569-141082-0004 YES SIR IT WAS I WHO SOLD DOCTOR BARNICOT HIS TWO STATUES DISGRACEFUL SIR A NIHILIST PLOT THAT'S WHAT I MAKE IT NO ONE BUT AN ANARCHIST WOULD GO ABOUT BREAKING STATUES RED REPUBLICANS THAT'S WHAT I CALL EM WHO DID I GET THE STATUES FROM I DON'T SEE WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH IT
1569-141082-0005 THEY ARE A WELL KNOWN HOUSE IN THE TRADE AND HAVE BEEN THIS TWENTY YEARS HOW MANY HAD I THREE TWO AND ONE ARE THREE TWO OF DOCTOR BARNICOT'S AND ONE SMASHED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT ON MY OWN COUNTER DO I KNOW THAT PHOTOGRAPH NO I DON'T YES I DO THOUGH WHY IT'S BEPPO
1569-141082-0006 HE WAS A KIND OF ITALIAN PIECE WORK MAN WHO MADE HIMSELF USEFUL IN THE SHOP HE COULD CARVE A BIT AND GILD AND FRAME AND DO ODD JOBS THE FELLOW LEFT ME LAST WEEK AND I'VE HEARD NOTHING OF HIM SINCE NO I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE CAME FROM NOR WHERE HE WENT TO
1569-141082-0007 I HAD NOTHING AGAINST HIM WHILE HE WAS HERE HE WAS GONE TWO DAYS BEFORE THE BUST WAS SMASHED WELL
1569-141082-0008 SAID HOLMES AS WE EMERGED FROM THE SHOP WE HAVE THIS BEPPO AS A COMMON FACTOR BOTH IN KENNINGTON AND IN KENSINGTON SO THAT IS WORTH A TEN MILE DRIVE NOW WATSON
1569-141082-0009 OF STEPNEY THE SOURCE AND ORIGIN OF THE BUSTS I SHALL BE SURPRISED IF WE DON'T GET SOME HELP DOWN THERE IN RAPID SUCCESSION WE PASSED THROUGH THE FRINGE OF FASHIONABLE LONDON HOTEL LONDON THEATRICAL LONDON LITERARY LONDON COMMERCIAL LONDON
1569-141082-0010 AND FINALLY MARITIME LONDON TILL WE CAME TO A RIVERSIDE CITY OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS WHERE THE TENEMENT HOUSES SWELTER AND REEK WITH THE OUTCASTS OF EUROPE HERE IN A BROAD THOROUGHFARE ONCE THE ABODE OF WEALTHY CITY MERCHANTS
1569-141082-0011 OUTSIDE WAS A CONSIDERABLE YARD FULL OF MONUMENTAL MASONRY INSIDE WAS A LARGE ROOM IN WHICH FIFTY WORKERS WERE CARVING OR MOULDING THE MANAGER A BIG BLOND GERMAN RECEIVED US CIVILLY AND GAVE A CLEAR ANSWER TO ALL HOLMES'S QUESTIONS
1569-141082-0012 A REFERENCE TO HIS BOOKS SHOWED THAT HUNDREDS OF CASTS HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM A MARBLE COPY OF DEVINE'S HEAD OF NAPOLEON BUT THAT THE THREE WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO MORSE HUDSON A YEAR OR SO BEFORE HAD BEEN HALF OF A BATCH OF SIX THE OTHER THREE BEING SENT TO HARDING BROTHERS OF KENSINGTON
1569-141082-0013 HE COULD SUGGEST NO POSSIBLE CAUSE WHY ANYONE SHOULD WISH TO DESTROY THEM IN FACT HE LAUGHED AT THE IDEA THEIR WHOLESALE PRICE WAS SIX SHILLINGS
1569-141082-0014 THE CAST WAS TAKEN IN TWO MOULDS FROM EACH SIDE OF THE FACE AND THEN THESE TWO PROFILES OF PLASTER OF PARIS WERE JOINED TOGETHER TO MAKE THE COMPLETE BUST THE WORK WAS USUALLY DONE BY ITALIANS IN THE ROOM WE WERE IN WHEN FINISHED THE BUSTS WERE PUT ON A TABLE IN THE PASSAGE TO DRY
1569-141082-0015 AND AFTERWARDS STORED THAT WAS ALL HE COULD TELL US BUT THE PRODUCTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPH HAD A REMARKABLE EFFECT UPON THE MANAGER HIS FACE FLUSHED WITH ANGER AND HIS BROWS KNOTTED OVER HIS BLUE TEUTONIC EYES AH THE RASCAL HE CRIED
1569-141082-0016 YES INDEED I KNOW HIM VERY WELL THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A RESPECTABLE ESTABLISHMENT AND THE ONLY TIME THAT WE HAVE EVER HAD THE POLICE IN IT WAS OVER THIS VERY FELLOW IT WAS MORE THAN A YEAR AGO NOW HE KNIFED ANOTHER ITALIAN IN THE STREET
1569-141082-0017 BEPPO WAS HIS NAME HIS SECOND NAME I NEVER KNEW SERVE ME RIGHT FOR ENGAGING A MAN WITH SUCH A FACE BUT HE WAS A GOOD WORKMAN ONE OF THE BEST WHAT DID HE GET THE MAN LIVED AND HE GOT OFF WITH A YEAR
1569-141082-0018 I HAVE NO DOUBT HE IS OUT NOW BUT HE HAS NOT DARED TO SHOW HIS NOSE HERE WE HAVE A COUSIN OF HIS HERE AND I DARESAY HE COULD TELL YOU WHERE HE IS NO NO CRIED HOLMES
1569-141082-0019 THE MATTER IS VERY IMPORTANT AND THE FARTHER I GO WITH IT THE MORE IMPORTANT IT SEEMS TO GROW WHEN YOU REFERRED IN YOUR LEDGER TO THE SALE OF THOSE CASTS I OBSERVED THAT THE DATE WAS JUNE THIRD OF LAST YEAR COULD YOU GIVE ME THE DATE WHEN BEPPO WAS ARRESTED
1569-141082-0020 I COULD TELL YOU ROUGHLY BY THE PAY LIST THE MANAGER ANSWERED YES HE CONTINUED AFTER SOME TURNING OVER OF PAGES HE WAS PAID LAST ON MAY TWENTIETH THANK YOU SAID HOLMES
1569-141082-0021 I DON'T THINK THAT I NEED INTRUDE UPON YOUR TIME AND PATIENCE ANY MORE WITH A LAST WORD OF CAUTION THAT HE SHOULD SAY NOTHING AS TO OUR RESEARCHES WE TURNED OUR FACES WESTWARD ONCE MORE
1569-141082-0022 A NEWS BILL AT THE ENTRANCE ANNOUNCED KENSINGTON OUTRAGE MURDER BY A MADMAN AND THE CONTENTS OF THE PAPER SHOWED THAT MISTER HORACE HARKER HAD GOT HIS ACCOUNT INTO PRINT AFTER ALL
1569-141082-0023 TWO COLUMNS WERE OCCUPIED WITH A HIGHLY SENSATIONAL AND FLOWERY RENDERING OF THE WHOLE INCIDENT HOLMES PROPPED IT AGAINST THE CRUET STAND AND READ IT WHILE HE ATE ONCE OR TWICE HE CHUCKLED THIS IS ALL RIGHT WATSON SAID HE LISTEN TO THIS
1569-141082-0024 IT IS SATISFACTORY TO KNOW THAT THERE CAN BE NO DIFFERENCE OF OPINION UPON THIS CASE SINCE MISTER LESTRADE ONE OF THE MOST EXPERIENCED MEMBERS OF THE OFFICIAL FORCE AND MISTER SHERLOCK HOLMES THE WELL KNOWN CONSULTING EXPERT
1569-141082-0025 HAVE EACH COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE GROTESQUE SERIES OF INCIDENTS WHICH HAVE ENDED IN SO TRAGIC A FASHION ARISE FROM LUNACY RATHER THAN FROM DELIBERATE CRIME NO EXPLANATION SAVE MENTAL ABERRATION CAN COVER THE FACTS
1569-141082-0026 THE PRESS WATSON IS A MOST VALUABLE INSTITUTION IF YOU ONLY KNOW HOW TO USE IT AND NOW IF YOU HAVE QUITE FINISHED
1569-141082-0027 THE FOUNDER OF THAT GREAT EMPORIUM PROVED TO BE A BRISK CRISP LITTLE PERSON VERY DAPPER AND QUICK WITH A CLEAR HEAD AND A READY TONGUE
1569-141082-0028 MISTER HORACE HARKER IS A CUSTOMER OF OURS WE SUPPLIED HIM WITH THE BUST SOME MONTHS AGO
1569-141082-0029 THEY ARE ALL SOLD NOW TO WHOM OH I DARESAY BY CONSULTING OUR SALES BOOK WE COULD VERY EASILY TELL YOU YES WE HAVE THE ENTRIES HERE ONE TO MISTER HARKER YOU SEE AND ONE TO MISTER JOSIAH BROWN OF LABURNUM LODGE LABURNUM VALE
1569-141082-0030 CHISWICK AND ONE TO MISTER SANDEFORD OF LOWER GROVE ROAD READING NO I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS FACE WHICH YOU SHOW ME IN THE PHOTOGRAPH YOU WOULD HARDLY FORGET IT WOULD YOU SIR FOR I'VE SELDOM SEEN AN UGLIER HAVE WE ANY ITALIANS ON THE STAFF
1569-141082-0031 YES SIR WE HAVE SEVERAL AMONG OUR WORKPEOPLE AND CLEANERS I DARESAY THEY MIGHT GET A PEEP AT THAT SALES BOOK IF THEY WANTED TO THERE IS NO PARTICULAR REASON FOR KEEPING A WATCH UPON THAT BOOK
1569-141082-0032 HOLMES HAD TAKEN SEVERAL NOTES DURING MISTER HARDING'S EVIDENCE AND I COULD SEE THAT HE WAS THOROUGHLY SATISFIED BY THE TURN WHICH AFFAIRS WERE TAKING HE MADE NO REMARK HOWEVER SAVE THAT UNLESS WE HURRIED WE SHOULD BE LATE FOR OUR APPOINTMENT WITH LESTRADE
1569-141082-0033 AND WE FOUND HIM PACING UP AND DOWN IN A FEVER OF IMPATIENCE HIS LOOK OF IMPORTANCE SHOWED THAT HIS DAY'S WORK HAD NOT BEEN IN VAIN WELL HE ASKED WHAT LUCK MISTER HOLMES WE HAVE HAD A VERY BUSY DAY AND NOT ENTIRELY A WASTED ONE
1569-141082-0034 MY FRIEND EXPLAINED WE HAVE SEEN BOTH THE RETAILERS AND ALSO THE WHOLESALE MANUFACTURERS I CAN TRACE EACH OF THE BUSTS NOW FROM THE BEGINNING THE
1569-141082-0035 WELL WELL YOU HAVE YOUR OWN METHODS MISTER SHERLOCK HOLMES AND IT IS NOT FOR ME TO SAY A WORD AGAINST THEM BUT I THINK I HAVE DONE A BETTER DAY'S WORK THAN YOU I HAVE IDENTIFIED THE DEAD MAN YOU DON'T SAY SO
1569-141082-0036 AND FOUND A CAUSE FOR THE CRIME SPLENDID
1569-141082-0037 WELL THIS DEAD MAN HAD SOME CATHOLIC EMBLEM ROUND HIS NECK
1569-141082-0038 MADE ME THINK HE WAS FROM THE SOUTH INSPECTOR HILL KNEW HIM THE MOMENT HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM HIS NAME IS PIETRO VENUCCI FROM NAPLES AND HE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST CUT THROATS IN LONDON HE IS CONNECTED WITH THE MAFIA WHICH AS YOU KNOW
1569-141082-0039 IS A SECRET POLITICAL SOCIETY ENFORCING ITS DECREES BY MURDER NOW YOU SEE HOW THE AFFAIR BEGINS TO CLEAR UP THE OTHER FELLOW IS PROBABLY AN ITALIAN ALSO AND A MEMBER OF THE MAFIA HE HAS BROKEN THE RULES IN SOME FASHION
1569-141082-0040 PIETRO IS SET UPON HIS TRACK PROBABLY THE PHOTOGRAPH WE FOUND IN HIS POCKET IS THE MAN HIMSELF SO THAT HE MAY NOT KNIFE THE WRONG PERSON HE DOGS THE FELLOW HE SEES HIM ENTER A HOUSE HE WAITS OUTSIDE FOR HIM
1569-141082-0041 AND IN THE SCUFFLE HE RECEIVES HIS OWN DEATH WOUND HOW IS THAT MISTER SHERLOCK HOLMES HOLMES CLAPPED HIS HANDS APPROVINGLY
1569-141082-0042 AFTER ALL THAT IS NOTHING
1569-141082-0043 AND I TELL YOU THAT I AM GATHERING ALL THE THREADS INTO MY HANDS AND THE NEXT STAGE IS A VERY SIMPLE ONE I SHALL GO DOWN WITH HILL TO THE ITALIAN QUARTER FIND THE MAN WHOSE PHOTOGRAPH WE HAVE GOT AND ARREST HIM ON THE CHARGE OF MURDER
1569-141082-0044 WILL YOU COME WITH US I THINK NOT I FANCY WE CAN ATTAIN OUR END IN A SIMPLER WAY I CAN'T SAY FOR CERTAIN BECAUSE IT ALL DEPENDS WELL IT ALL DEPENDS UPON A FACTOR WHICH IS COMPLETELY OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL
1569-141082-0045 BUT I HAVE GREAT HOPES IN FACT THE BETTING IS EXACTLY TWO TO ONE
1569-141082-0046 IN THE ITALIAN QUARTER NO I FANCY CHISWICK IS AN ADDRESS WHICH IS MORE LIKELY TO FIND HIM IF YOU WILL COME WITH ME TO CHISWICK TO NIGHT LESTRADE I'LL PROMISE TO GO TO THE ITALIAN QUARTER WITH YOU TO MORROW AND NO HARM WILL BE DONE BY THE DELAY
1569-141082-0047 AND NOW I THINK THAT A FEW HOURS SLEEP WOULD DO US ALL GOOD FOR I DO NOT PROPOSE TO LEAVE BEFORE ELEVEN O'CLOCK AND IT IS UNLIKELY THAT WE SHALL BE BACK BEFORE MORNING YOU'LL DINE WITH US LESTRADE AND THEN YOU ARE WELCOME TO THE SOFA UNTIL IT IS TIME FOR US TO START
