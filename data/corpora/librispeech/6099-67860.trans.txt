6099-67860-0000 A CHRISTMAS PRESENT EVERY NOOK AND CORNER OF FORT MOULTRIE WAS SEARCHED FOR THE MISSING SYLVIA AND WHEN NO TRACE OF HER COULD BE DISCOVERED
6099-67860-0001 HER FRIENDS BECAME NEARLY CERTAIN THAT THE LITTLE GIRL MUST HAVE SLIPPED FROM THE LANDING PLACE INTO THE SEA AND THAT IT WAS USELESS TO SEARCH FOR HER BUT IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING BEFORE MISTER FULTON GAVE UP THE SEARCH
6099-67860-0002 AT ABOUT THE TIME WHEN ESTRALLA AND SYLVIA WERE EMBARKING UPON THEIR ADVENTUROUS VOYAGE TO FORT SUMTER NO ONE HAD GIVEN A THOUGHT TO THE LITTLE DARKY GIRL SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SOMEWHERE ABOUT THE FORT
6099-67860-0003 GRACE WARMLY WRAPPED IN A THICK SHAWL SAT BESIDE MISTER FULTON AS THE BUTTERFLY MADE ITS SWIFT WAY ACROSS THE DARK HARBOR THEY COULD SEE THE DARK LINE OF THE GUARD BOAT
6099-67860-0004 WHY I HAD ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN HER RESPONDED MISTER FULTON SHE RAN OFF AS SOON AS SYLVIA WAS MISSED GRACE CONTINUED EARNESTLY AND SHE WILL FIND HER PROBABLY SHE HAS FOUND HER BEFORE THIS
6099-67860-0005 I BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT ESTRALLA IS A CLEVER LITTLE DARKY AND IF SHE STARTED IN SEARCH OF SYLVIA PERHAPS SHE HAS BEEN ABLE TO FIND HER I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF IT AND MISTER FULTON'S VOICE HAD A NEW NOTE OF HOPE
6099-67860-0006 THANK YOU GRACE I WILL START BACK TO THE FORT AS SOON AS I HAVE TALKED WITH SYLVIA'S MOTHER BUT ON MISTER FULTON'S RETURN TO THE WHARF HE FOUND A SENTRY ON GUARD WHO REFUSED HIM PERMISSION TO GO TO THE FORT
6099-67860-0007 IT WAS IN VAIN THAT MISTER FULTON EXPLAINED THAT HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER WAS LOST THAT HE MUST BE PERMITTED TO RETURN TO THE FORT THE SENTRY WASTED NO WORDS ORDERS SIR SORRY WAS THE ONLY RESPONSE HE COULD GET
6099-67860-0008 OF THE ASSEMBLING OF SOLDIERS IN THE CITY AND THE EVIDENT PLAN OF THE SOUTHERNERS TO SEIZE THE FORTS IN THE HARBOR AND FORCE THE GOVERNMENT INTO WAR HE REALIZED THAT
6099-67860-0009 IN THAT CASE IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR HIS FAMILY TO REMAIN IN CHARLESTON EARLY THE NEXT MORNING SYLVIA WAS AWAKENED AND MADE READY FOR HER RETURN AND WHEN THE SUN SHONE BRIGHTLY OVER THE WATERS OF THE HARBOR
6099-67860-0010 SHE AND ESTRALLA WITH CAPTAIN GERALD AND A STRONG NEGRO SERVANT WERE ON BOARD A BOAT SAILING RAPIDLY TOWARD HOME THEY LANDED AT THE WHARF WHERE THE BUTTERFLY WAS FASTENED
6099-67860-0011 AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT HER MOTHER'S ARMS WERE ABOUT HER AND SHE WAS TELLING AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE THE STORY OF HER ADVENTURES AND OF ESTRALLA COMING TO HER RESCUE GRACE CAME RUNNING TO MEET SYLVIA AS THEY CAME NEAR THEIR HOME
6099-67860-0012 OH SYLVIA I WISH I HAD BEEN WITH YOU SHE EXCLAIMED
6099-67860-0013 WE WILL HOPE THAT HER NEXT VISIT WILL NOT BE AS DANGEROUS AS THIS ONE SAID MISTER FULTON SOBERLY FOR SEVERAL DAYS SYLVIA COULD THINK AND TALK ONLY OF HER WANDERINGS AMONG THE SAND HILLS AND OF HER FIRST SIGHT OF THE GUARD BOAT
6099-67860-0014 SHE BEGAN TEACHING ESTRALLA ON THE VERY DAY OF HER RETURN AND THE LITTLE DARKY MADE RAPID PROGRESS FATHER WHEN MAY WE GO TO FORT MOULTRIE AGAIN SHE ASKED ONE MORNING A FEW DAYS LATER
6099-67860-0015 I DO NOT KNOW THAT WE SHALL EVER GO TO THE FORTS AGAIN HER FATHER HAD REPLIED DID YOU NOT HEAR THE BELLS RINGING AND THE MILITARY MUSIC YESTERDAY SOUTH CAROLINA HAS SECEDED FROM THE UNION
6099-67860-0016 IT SEEMED TO SYLVIA THAT HER MOTHER WAS VERY GLAD AT THE THOUGHT OF RETURNING TO HER FORMER HOME BUT SYLVIA WAS NOT GLAD WHAT WOULD BECOME OF ESTRALLA
6099-67860-0017 SHE WOULDN'T LEAVE ME TO BE A SLAVE MISTER AND MISSUS FULTON LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH PUZZLED EYES BUT ESTRALLA WOULD NOT WANT TO LEAVE HER MAMMY SUGGESTED MISTER FULTON OH FATHER

6099-67860-0019 I AM AFRAID IT WOULDN'T BE MUCH USE FOR ME TO EVEN TRY TO BUY A SLAVE'S FREEDOM NOW MISTER FULTON SAID A LITTLE SADLY DON'T SUGGEST SUCH A THING TO AUNT CONNIE SYLVIA WHEN SHALL WE GO TO BOSTON SYLVIA ASKED
6099-67860-0020 RIGHT AWAY AFTER CHRISTMAS UNLESS FORT SUMTER IS ATTACKED BEFORE THAT TIME WASHINGTON OUGHT TO SEND TROOPS AND PROVISIONS FOR THE FORTS AT ONCE REPLIED MISTER FULTON AFTER HER FATHER HAD LEFT THE HOUSE

6099-67860-0023 RESPONDED MISSUS FULTON AND SYLVIA WENT SLOWLY TO HER OWN ROOM WHERE ESTRALLA WAS WAITING FOR HER THE LITTLE COLORED GIRL HAD PUT THE ROOM IN ORDER THERE WAS A BRIGHT FIRE IN THE GRATE

6099-67860-0029 AS FAR AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO SO AND YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE CHARLESTON IMMEDIATELY THE CITY IS NO LONGER A SAFE PLACE FOR NORTHERN PEOPLE THE CONFLICT MAY BEGIN AT ANY MOMENT
6099-67860-0030 PROBABLY IT MEANT SOMETHING DREADFUL SHE THOUGHT RECALLING THE QUESTION PERIOD AT MISS ROSALIE'S SCHOOL JUST THEN MISTER WAITE GLANCED TOWARD THE DOOR AND SAW SYLVIA IN A SECOND HE WAS ON HIS FEET
6099-67860-0031 AND SMILED WITH DELIGHT AT MISTER WAITE'S GREETING AS HE LED HER TOWARD HER MOTHER AND WITH ANOTHER POLITE BOW GAVE HER THE SEAT ON THE SOFA I WAS HOPING TO SEE MISS SYLVIA HE SAID I HAD MEANT TO MAKE HER A LITTLE CHRISTMAS GIFT
