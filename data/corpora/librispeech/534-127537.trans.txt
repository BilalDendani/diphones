534-127537-0000 THE TREASURE HUNT FLINT'S POINTER JIM SAID SILVER WHEN WE WERE ALONE IF I SAVED YOUR LIFE YOU SAVED MINE AND I'LL NOT FORGET IT I SEEN THE DOCTOR WAVING YOU TO RUN FOR IT WITH THE TAIL OF MY EYE I DID
534-127537-0001 JIM THAT'S ONE TO YOU THIS IS THE FIRST GLINT OF HOPE I HAD SINCE THE ATTACK FAILED
534-127537-0002 AND NOW JIM WE'RE TO GO IN FOR THIS HERE TREASURE HUNTING WITH SEALED ORDERS TOO AND I DON'T LIKE IT AND YOU
534-127537-0003 MUST STICK CLOSE BACK TO BACK LIKE
534-127537-0004 JUST THEN A MAN HAILED US FROM THE FIRE THAT BREAKFAST WAS READY AND WE WERE SOON SEATED HERE AND THERE ABOUT THE SAND OVER BISCUIT AND FRIED JUNK
534-127537-0005 AND IT WAS NOW GROWN SO HOT THAT THEY COULD ONLY APPROACH IT FROM THE WINDWARD AND EVEN THERE NOT WITHOUT PRECAUTION IN THE SAME WASTEFUL SPIRIT THEY HAD COOKED I SUPPOSE THREE TIMES MORE THAN WE COULD EAT AND ONE OF THEM WITH AN EMPTY LAUGH
534-127537-0006 THREW WHAT WAS LEFT INTO THE FIRE WHICH BLAZED AND ROARED AGAIN OVER THIS UNUSUAL FUEL I NEVER IN MY LIFE SAW MEN SO CARELESS OF THE MORROW HAND TO MOUTH IS THE ONLY WORD THAT CAN DESCRIBE THEIR WAY OF DOING
534-127537-0007 AND WHAT WITH WASTED FOOD AND SLEEPING SENTRIES THOUGH THEY WERE BOLD ENOUGH FOR A BRUSH AND BE DONE WITH IT I COULD SEE THEIR ENTIRE UNFITNESS FOR ANYTHING LIKE A PROLONGED CAMPAIGN EVEN SILVER
534-127537-0008 EATING AWAY WITH CAPTAIN FLINT UPON HIS SHOULDER HAD NOT A WORD OF BLAME FOR THEIR RECKLESSNESS AND THIS THE MORE SURPRISED ME FOR I THOUGHT HE HAD NEVER SHOWN HIMSELF SO CUNNING AS HE DID THEN
534-127537-0009 SAID HE IT'S LUCKY YOU HAVE BARBECUE TO THINK FOR YOU WITH THIS HERE HEAD I GOT WHAT I WANTED I DID SURE ENOUGH THEY HAVE THE SHIP WHERE THEY HAVE IT I DON'T KNOW YET BUT ONCE WE HIT THE TREASURE
534-127537-0010 WE'LL HAVE TO JUMP ABOUT AND FIND OUT AND THEN MATES US THAT HAS THE BOATS I RECKON HAS THE UPPER HAND THUS HE KEPT RUNNING ON WITH HIS MOUTH FULL OF THE HOT BACON THUS HE RESTORED THEIR HOPE AND CONFIDENCE AND
534-127537-0011 BUT IT'S OVER AND DONE I'LL TAKE HIM IN A LINE WHEN WE GO TREASURE HUNTING FOR WE'LL KEEP HIM LIKE SO MUCH GOLD IN CASE OF ACCIDENTS YOU MARK AND IN THE MEANTIME ONCE WE GOT THE SHIP AND TREASURE BOTH
534-127537-0012 AND OFF TO SEA LIKE JOLLY COMPANIONS WHY THEN WE'LL TALK MISTER HAWKINS OVER WE WILL AND WE'LL GIVE HIM HIS SHARE TO BE SURE FOR ALL HIS KINDNESS
534-127537-0013 FOR MY PART I WAS HORRIBLY CAST DOWN SHOULD THE SCHEME HE HAD NOW SKETCHED PROVE FEASIBLE SILVER ALREADY DOUBLY A TRAITOR WOULD NOT HESITATE TO ADOPT IT
534-127537-0014 HE HAD STILL A FOOT IN EITHER CAMP AND THERE WAS NO DOUBT HE WOULD PREFER WEALTH AND FREEDOM WITH THE PIRATES TO A BARE ESCAPE FROM HANGING WHICH WAS THE BEST HE HAD TO HOPE ON OUR SIDE NAY AND EVEN IF THINGS
534-127537-0015 HE A CRIPPLE AND I A BOY AGAINST FIVE STRONG AND ACTIVE SEAMEN ADD TO THIS DOUBLE APPREHENSION THE MYSTERY THAT STILL HUNG OVER THE BEHAVIOUR OF MY FRIENDS THEIR UNEXPLAINED DESERTION OF THE STOCKADE THEIR INEXPLICABLE CESSION OF THE CHART
534-127537-0016 OR HARDER STILL TO UNDERSTAND THE DOCTOR'S LAST WARNING TO SILVER LOOK OUT FOR SQUALLS WHEN YOU FIND IT AND YOU WILL READILY BELIEVE HOW LITTLE TASTE I FOUND IN MY BREAKFAST AND WITH HOW UNEASY A HEART I SET FORTH BEHIND MY CAPTORS
534-127537-0017 BESIDES THE GREAT CUTLASS AT HIS WAIST AND A PISTOL IN EACH POCKET OF HIS SQUARE TAILED COAT TO COMPLETE HIS STRANGE APPEARANCE CAPTAIN FLINT SAT PERCHED UPON HIS SHOULDER AND GABBLING ODDS AND ENDS OF PURPOSELESS SEA TALK
534-127537-0018 CAME FROM OUR STOCK AND I COULD SEE THE TRUTH OF SILVER'S WORDS THE NIGHT BEFORE HAD HE NOT STRUCK A BARGAIN WITH THE DOCTOR HE AND HIS MUTINEERS DESERTED BY THE SHIP MUST HAVE BEEN DRIVEN TO SUBSIST ON CLEAR WATER AND THE PROCEEDS OF THEIR HUNTING
534-127537-0019 WATER WOULD HAVE BEEN LITTLE TO THEIR TASTE A SAILOR IS NOT USUALLY A GOOD SHOT AND BESIDES ALL THAT WHEN THEY WERE SO SHORT OF EATABLES IT WAS NOT LIKELY THEY WOULD BE VERY FLUSH OF POWDER WELL THUS EQUIPPED WE ALL SET OUT EVEN THE FELLOW WITH THE BROKEN HEAD
534-127537-0020 AND STRAGGLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO THE BEACH WHERE THE TWO GIGS AWAITED US EVEN THESE BORE TRACE OF THE DRUNKEN FOLLY OF THE PIRATES ONE IN A BROKEN THWART AND BOTH IN THEIR MUDDY AND UNBAILED CONDITION
534-127537-0021 BOTH WERE TO BE CARRIED ALONG WITH US FOR THE SAKE OF SAFETY AND SO WITH OUR NUMBERS DIVIDED BETWEEN THEM WE SET FORTH UPON THE BOSOM OF THE ANCHORAGE AS WE PULLED OVER THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ON THE CHART
534-127537-0022 THE RED CROSS WAS OF COURSE FAR TOO LARGE TO BE A GUIDE AND THE TERMS OF THE NOTE ON THE BACK AS YOU WILL HEAR
534-127537-0023 OF SOME AMBIGUITY THEY RAN THE READER MAY REMEMBER THUS TALL TREE SPY GLASS SHOULDER BEARING A POINT TO THE N OF N N E SKELETON ISLAND
534-127537-0024 E S E AND BY E TEN FEET A TALL TREE WAS THUS THE PRINCIPAL MARK NOW RIGHT BEFORE US THE ANCHORAGE WAS BOUNDED BY A PLATEAU FROM TWO TO THREE HUNDRED FEET HIGH
534-127537-0025 ADJOINING ON THE NORTH THE SLOPING SOUTHERN SHOULDER OF THE SPY GLASS AND
534-127537-0026 THE TOP OF THE PLATEAU WAS DOTTED THICKLY WITH PINE TREES OF VARYING HEIGHT EVERY HERE AND THERE ONE OF A DIFFERENT SPECIES ROSE FORTY OR FIFTY FEET CLEAR ABOVE ITS NEIGHBOURS AND WHICH OF THESE WAS THE PARTICULAR TALL TREE OF CAPTAIN FLINT
534-127537-0027 COULD ONLY BE DECIDED ON THE SPOT
534-127537-0028 ERE WE WERE HALF WAY OVER LONG JOHN ALONE SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS AND BIDDING THEM WAIT TILL THEY WERE THERE WE PULLED EASILY BY SILVER'S DIRECTIONS NOT TO WEARY THE HANDS PREMATURELY AND AFTER QUITE A LONG PASSAGE
534-127537-0029 BUT BY LITTLE AND LITTLE THE HILL BEGAN TO STEEPEN AND BECOME STONY UNDER FOOT AND THE WOOD TO CHANGE ITS CHARACTER AND TO GROW IN A MORE OPEN ORDER IT WAS INDEED A MOST PLEASANT PORTION OF THE ISLAND THAT WE WERE NOW APPROACHING
534-127537-0030 A HEAVY SCENTED BROOM AND MANY FLOWERING SHRUBS HAD ALMOST TAKEN THE PLACE OF GRASS THICKETS OF GREEN NUTMEG TREES WERE DOTTED HERE AND THERE WITH THE RED COLUMNS AND THE BROAD SHADOW OF THE PINES AND THE FIRST
534-127537-0031 MINGLED THEIR SPICE WITH THE AROMA OF THE OTHERS THE AIR BESIDES WAS FRESH AND STIRRING AND THIS UNDER THE SHEER SUNBEAMS WAS A WONDERFUL REFRESHMENT TO OUR SENSES
534-127537-0032 THE PARTY SPREAD ITSELF ABROAD IN A FAN SHAPE SHOUTING AND LEAPING TO AND FRO ABOUT THE CENTRE AND A GOOD WAY BEHIND THE REST SILVER AND I FOLLOWED I TETHERED BY MY ROPE HE PLOUGHING WITH DEEP PANTS AMONG THE SLIDING GRAVEL FROM TIME TO TIME
534-127537-0033 INDEED I HAD TO LEND HIM A HAND OR HE MUST HAVE MISSED HIS FOOTING AND FALLEN BACKWARD DOWN THE HILL WE HAD THUS PROCEEDED FOR ABOUT HALF A MILE AND WERE APPROACHING THE BROW OF THE PLATEAU WHEN THE MAN UPON THE FARTHEST LEFT BEGAN TO CRY ALOUD AS IF IN TERROR
534-127537-0034 SHOUT AFTER SHOUT CAME FROM HIM AND THE OTHERS BEGAN TO RUN IN HIS DIRECTION HE CAN'T A FOUND THE TREASURE SAID OLD MORGAN HURRYING PAST US FROM THE RIGHT
534-127537-0035 AT THE FOOT OF A PRETTY BIG PINE AND INVOLVED IN A GREEN CREEPER WHICH HAD EVEN PARTLY LIFTED SOME OF THE SMALLER BONES A HUMAN SKELETON LAY WITH A FEW SHREDS OF CLOTHING ON THE GROUND I BELIEVE A CHILL STRUCK FOR A MOMENT TO EVERY HEART
534-127537-0036 HE WAS A SEAMAN SAID GEORGE MERRY WHO BOLDER THAN THE REST HAD GONE UP CLOSE AND WAS EXAMINING THE RAGS OF CLOTHING LEASTWAYS THIS IS GOOD SEA CLOTH AYE AYE SAID SILVER LIKE ENOUGH
534-127537-0037 YOU WOULDN'T LOOK TO FIND A BISHOP HERE I RECKON BUT WHAT SORT OF A WAY IS THAT FOR BONES TO LIE TAIN'T IN NATUR INDEED ON A SECOND GLANCE IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO FANCY THAT THE BODY WAS IN A NATURAL POSITION
534-127537-0038 HIS HANDS RAISED ABOVE HIS HEAD LIKE A DIVER'S POINTING DIRECTLY IN THE OPPOSITE I'VE TAKEN A NOTION INTO MY OLD NUMBSKULL OBSERVED SILVER HERE'S THE COMPASS THERE'S THE TIP
534-127537-0039 JUST TAKE A BEARING WILL YOU ALONG THE LINE OF THEM BONES IT WAS DONE THE BODY POINTED STRAIGHT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ISLAND AND THE COMPASS READ DULY E S
534-127537-0040 NOR NOT NICE SAYS YOU GREAT GUNS MESSMATES BUT IF FLINT WAS LIVING THIS WOULD BE A HOT SPOT FOR YOU AND ME
534-127537-0041 I SAW HIM DEAD WITH THESE HERE DEADLIGHTS SAID MORGAN BILLY TOOK ME IN THERE HE LAID WITH
534-127537-0042 BUT IF EVER SPERRIT WALKED IT WOULD BE FLINT'S DEAR HEART BUT HE DIED BAD DID FLINT AYE THAT HE DID OBSERVED ANOTHER NOW HE RAGED AND NOW HE HOLLERED FOR THE RUM
534-127537-0043 AND NOW HE SANG FIFTEEN MEN WERE HIS ONLY SONG MATES
534-127537-0044 IT WAS MAIN HOT AND THE WINDY WAS OPEN AND I HEAR THAT OLD SONG COMIN OUT AS CLEAR AS CLEAR AND THE DEATH HAUL ON THE MAN ALREADY COME COME SAID SILVER STOW THIS TALK HE'S DEAD
534-127537-0045 AND HE DON'T WALK THAT I KNOW LEASTWAYS HE WON'T WALK BY DAY AND YOU MAY LAY TO THAT CARE KILLED A CAT FETCH AHEAD FOR THE DOUBLOONS
534-127537-0046 WE STARTED CERTAINLY BUT IN SPITE OF THE HOT SUN AND THE STARING DAYLIGHT THE PIRATES NO LONGER RAN SEPARATE AND SHOUTING THROUGH THE WOOD
