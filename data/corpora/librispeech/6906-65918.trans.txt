6906-65918-0000 HIS DUTIES THEN HAD SELDOM PERMITTED HIM TO LEAVE THE COURT IF HE HAD GIVEN NO SIGN OF LIFE DURING THE EMPIRE IT WAS BECAUSE HE HAD NOT BEEN COMPELLED TO SUBMIT TO THE HUMILIATIONS AND SUFFERING WHICH SO MANY OF THE EMIGRANTS WERE OBLIGED TO ENDURE IN THEIR EXILE
6906-65918-0001 ON THE CONTRARY HE HAD RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR THE WEALTH OF WHICH HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED BY THE REVOLUTION A PRINCELY FORTUNE TAKING REFUGE IN LONDON AFTER THE DEFEAT OF THE ARMY OF CONDE
6906-65918-0002 HE HAD BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS TO PLEASE THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF LORD HOLLAND ONE OF THE RICHEST PEERS IN ENGLAND AND HE HAD MARRIED HER SHE POSSESSED A FORTUNE OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS STERLING MORE THAN SIX MILLION FRANCS
6906-65918-0003 STILL THE MARRIAGE WAS NOT A HAPPY ONE THE CHOSEN COMPANION OF THE DISSIPATED AND LICENTIOUS COUNT D'ARTOIS WAS NOT LIKELY TO PROVE A VERY GOOD HUSBAND
6906-65918-0004 AS SOON AS LES CONVENANCES PERMITTED HE CONFIDED HIS SON TO THE CARE OF A RELATIVE OF HIS WIFE AND BEGAN HIS ROVING LIFE AGAIN RUMOR HAD TOLD THE TRUTH HE HAD FOUGHT AND THAT FURIOUSLY AGAINST FRANCE IN THE AUSTRIAN
6906-65918-0005 AND THEN IN THE RUSSIAN RANKS AND HE TOOK NO PAINS TO CONCEAL THE FACT CONVINCED THAT HE HAD ONLY PERFORMED HIS DUTY HE CONSIDERED THAT HE HAD HONESTLY AND LOYALLY GAINED THE RANK OF GENERAL WHICH THE EMPEROR OF ALL THE RUSSIAS HAD BESTOWED UPON HIM
6906-65918-0006 HE HAD NOT RETURNED TO FRANCE DURING THE FIRST RESTORATION BUT HIS ABSENCE HAD BEEN INVOLUNTARY HIS FATHER IN LAW LORD HOLLAND HAD JUST DIED AND THE DUKE WAS DETAINED IN LONDON BY BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH HIS SON'S IMMENSE INHERITANCE
6906-65918-0007 THEN FOLLOWED THE HUNDRED DAYS THEY EXASPERATED HIM BUT THE GOOD CAUSE AS HE STYLED IT HAVING TRIUMPHED ANEW HE HASTENED TO FRANCE ALAS LACHENEUR JUDGED THE CHARACTER OF HIS FORMER MASTER CORRECTLY
6906-65918-0008 THIS MAN WHO HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO CONCEAL HIMSELF DURING THE FIRST RESTORATION KNEW ONLY TOO WELL THAT THE RETURNED EMIGRES HAD LEARNED NOTHING AND FORGOTTEN NOTHING THE DUC DE SAIRMEUSE WAS NO EXCEPTION TO THE RULE
6906-65918-0009 HE THOUGHT AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE SADLY ABSURD THAT A MERE ACT OF AUTHORITY WOULD SUFFICE TO SUPPRESS FOREVER ALL THE EVENTS OF THE REVOLUTION AND OF THE EMPIRE WHEN HE SAID
6906-65918-0010 I DO NOT ADMIT THAT HE FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID THAT CONTROVERSY WAS ENDED AND THAT WHAT HAD BEEN WAS AS IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN
6906-65918-0011 ASSURED THE DUKE THAT FRANCE HAD CHANGED IN MANY RESPECTS SINCE SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE HE RESPONDED WITH A SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS NONSENSE AS SOON AS WE ASSERT OURSELVES ALL THESE RASCALS WHOSE REBELLION ALARMS YOU
6906-65918-0012 WILL QUIETLY SINK OUT OF SIGHT SUCH WAS REALLY HIS OPINION ON THE WAY FROM MONTAIGNAC TO SAIRMEUSE THE DUKE COMFORTABLY ENSCONCED IN HIS BERLIN UNFOLDED HIS THEORIES FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS SON
6906-65918-0013 THE KING HAS BEEN POORLY ADVISED HE SAID IN CONCLUSION BESIDES I AM DISPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT HE INCLINES TOO MUCH TO JACOBINISM IF HE WOULD LISTEN TO MY ADVICE HE WOULD MAKE USE OF THE TWELVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SOLDIERS
6906-65918-0014 WHICH OUR FRIENDS HAVE PLACED AT HIS DISPOSAL TO BRING HIS SUBJECTS TO A SENSE OF THEIR DUTY
6906-65918-0015 HE CONTINUED HIS REMARKS ON THIS SUBJECT UNTIL THE CARRIAGE APPROACHED SAIRMEUSE THOUGH BUT LITTLE GIVEN TO SENTIMENT HE WAS REALLY AFFECTED BY THE SIGHT OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH HE WAS BORN
6906-65918-0016 WHERE HE HAD PLAYED AS A CHILD AND OF WHICH HE HAD HEARD NOTHING SINCE THE DEATH OF HIS AUNT
6906-65918-0017 I RECOGNIZE IT HE EXCLAIMED WITH A DELIGHT THAT MADE HIM FORGET POLITICS I RECOGNIZE IT SOON THE CHANGES BECAME MORE STRIKING THE CARRIAGE ENTERED SAIRMEUSE AND RATTLED OVER THE STONES OF THE ONLY STREET IN THE VILLAGE
6906-65918-0018 THIS STREET IN FORMER YEARS HAD BEEN UNPAVED AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN RENDERED IMPASSABLE BY WET WEATHER AH HA MURMURED THE DUKE THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE NOTICED OTHERS
6906-65918-0019 THE DILAPIDATED THATCHED HOVELS HAD GIVEN PLACE TO PRETTY AND COMFORTABLE WHITE COTTAGES WITH GREEN BLINDS AND A VINE HANGING GRACEFULLY OVER THE DOOR AS THE CARRIAGE PASSED THE PUBLIC SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH MARTIAL OBSERVED THE GROUPS OF PEASANTS WHO WERE STILL TALKING THERE
6906-65918-0020 DO THEY HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PREPARING A TRIUMPHAL RECEPTION FOR THEIR OLD MASTERS
6906-65918-0021 AND PLEASED BY THESE CRIES THAT PROVED HIM IN THE RIGHT
6906-65918-0022 THE OLD RASCAL HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILDREN ALL POSSESSED POWERFUL VOICES AND IT WAS NOT STRANGE THAT THE DUKE BELIEVED THE WHOLE VILLAGE WAS WELCOMING HIM HE WAS CONVINCED OF IT
6906-65918-0023 THAT THE PRESTIGE OF THE NOBILITY WAS GREATER THAN EVER UPON THE THRESHOLD OF THE PARSONAGE BIBIAINE THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER WAS STANDING SHE KNEW WHO THESE GUESTS MUST BE FOR THE CURE'S SERVANTS ALWAYS KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON
6906-65918-0024 MONSIEUR HAS NOT YET RETURNED FROM CHURCH SHE SAID IN RESPONSE TO THE DUKE'S INQUIRY BUT IF THE GENTLEMEN WISH TO WAIT IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE HE COMES FOR THE POOR DEAR MAN HAS NOT BREAKFASTED YET
6906-65918-0025 LET US GO IN THE DUKE SAID TO HIS SON AND GUIDED BY THE HOUSEKEEPER THEY ENTERED A SORT OF DRAWING ROOM WHERE THE TABLE WAS SPREAD
6906-65918-0026 THE HABITS OF A HOUSE REVEAL THOSE OF ITS MASTER THIS WAS CLEAN POOR AND BARE THE WALLS WERE WHITEWASHED A DOZEN CHAIRS COMPOSED THE ENTIRE FURNITURE UPON THE TABLE LAID WITH MONASTIC SIMPLICITY
6906-65918-0027 WERE ONLY TIN DISHES THIS WAS EITHER THE ABODE OF AN AMBITIOUS MAN OR A SAINT WILL THESE GENTLEMEN TAKE ANY REFRESHMENTS INQUIRED BIBIAINE UPON MY WORD REPLIED MARTIAL
6906-65918-0028 I MUST CONFESS THAT THE DRIVE HAS WHETTED MY APPETITE AMAZINGLY BLESSED JESUS EXCLAIMED THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER IN EVIDENT DESPAIR WHAT AM I TO DO I WHO HAVE NOTHING THAT IS TO SAY YES I HAVE AN OLD HEN LEFT IN THE COOP
6906-65918-0029 GIVE ME TIME TO WRING ITS NECK TO PICK IT AND CLEAN IT SHE PAUSED TO LISTEN AND THEY HEARD A STEP IN THE PASSAGE
6906-65918-0030 TALL ANGULAR AND SOLEMN HE WAS AS COLD AND IMPASSIVE AS THE STONES OF HIS CHURCH BY WHAT IMMENSE EFFORTS OF WILL AT THE COST OF WHAT TORTURE HAD HE MADE HIMSELF WHAT HE WAS
6906-65918-0031 ONE COULD FORM SOME IDEA OF THE TERRIBLE RESTRAINT TO WHICH HE HAD SUBJECTED HIMSELF BY LOOKING AT HIS EYES WHICH OCCASIONALLY EMITTED THE LIGHTNINGS OF AN IMPASSIONED SOUL WAS HE OLD OR YOUNG
6906-65918-0032 CUT IN TWO BY AN IMMENSE NOSE
6906-65918-0033 HE WORE A WHITE CASSOCK WHICH HAD BEEN PATCHED AND DARNED IN NUMBERLESS PLACES BUT WHICH WAS A MARVEL OF CLEANLINESS AND WHICH HUNG ABOUT HIS TALL ATTENUATED BODY LIKE THE SAILS OF A DISABLED VESSEL
6906-65918-0034 AT THE SIGHT OF THE TWO STRANGERS SEATED IN HIS DRAWING ROOM HE MANIFESTED SOME SLIGHT SURPRISE THE CARRIAGE STANDING BEFORE THE DOOR HAD ANNOUNCED THE PRESENCE OF A VISITOR BUT HE HAD EXPECTED TO FIND ONE OF HIS PARISHIONERS
6906-65918-0035 NO ONE HAD WARNED HIM OR THE SACRISTAN AND HE WAS WONDERING WITH WHOM HE HAD TO DEAL AND WHAT THEY DESIRED OF HIM MECHANICALLY HE TURNED TO BIBIAINE BUT THE OLD SERVANT HAD TAKEN FLIGHT THE DUKE UNDERSTOOD HIS HOST'S ASTONISHMENT
6906-65918-0036 WHO MAKES HIMSELF AT HOME EVERYWHERE WE HAVE TAKEN YOUR HOUSE BY STORM AND HOLD THE POSITION AS YOU SEE I AM THE DUC DE SAIRMEUSE AND THIS IS MY SON THE MARQUIS
6906-65918-0037 IT IS A GREAT HONOR FOR ME HE REPLIED IN A MORE THAN RESERVED TONE TO RECEIVE A VISIT FROM THE FORMER MASTER OF THIS PLACE
6906-65918-0038 UNFORTUNATELY HE CONTINUED YOU WILL NOT FIND HERE THE COMFORTS TO WHICH YOU ARE ACCUSTOMED AND I FEAR NONSENSE INTERRUPTED THE DUKE AN OLD SOLDIER IS NOT FASTIDIOUS AND WHAT SUFFICES FOR YOU MONSIEUR ABBE WILL SUFFICE FOR US
6906-65918-0039 THE PRIEST'S EYE FLASHED
6906-65918-0040 THIS LAST INSULTING REMARK KINDLED THE ANGER OF THE MAN CONCEALED BENEATH THE PRIEST BESIDES ADDED MARTIAL GAYLY
6906-65918-0041 WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THERE IS A CHICKEN IN THE COOP THAT IS TO SAY THERE WAS ONE MONSIEUR LE MARQUIS THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER WHO SUDDENLY REAPPEARED EXPLAINED HER MASTER'S RESPONSE SHE SEEMED OVERWHELMED WITH DESPAIR BLESSED VIRGIN
6906-65918-0042 MONSIEUR WHAT SHALL I DO SHE CLAMORED THE CHICKEN HAS DISAPPEARED SOMEONE HAS CERTAINLY STOLEN IT FOR THE COOP IS SECURELY CLOSED
6906-65918-0043 NO ONE HAS STOLEN IT FROM US BERTRANDE WAS HERE THIS MORNING TO ASK ALMS IN THE NAME OF HER SICK DAUGHTER
6906-65918-0044 THIS EXPLANATION CHANGED BIBIAINE'S CONSTERNATION TO FURY PLANTING HERSELF IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM ONE HAND UPON HER HIP AND GESTICULATING WILDLY WITH THE OTHER SHE EXCLAIMED POINTING TO HER MASTER
6906-65918-0045 THAT IS JUST THE SORT OF MAN HE IS HE HAS LESS SENSE THAN A BABY ANY MISERABLE PEASANT WHO MEETS HIM CAN MAKE HIM BELIEVE ANYTHING HE WISHES ANY GREAT FALSEHOOD BRINGS TEARS TO HIS EYES AND THEN THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY LIKE WITH HIM
6906-65918-0046 IN THAT WAY THEY TAKE THE VERY SHOES OFF HIS FEET AND THE BREAD FROM HIS MOUTH BERTRANDE'S DAUGHTER MESSIEURS IS NO MORE ILL THAN YOU OR I ENOUGH SAID THE PRIEST STERNLY ENOUGH
6906-65918-0047 THEN KNOWING BY EXPERIENCE THAT HIS VOICE HAD NOT THE POWER TO CHECK HER FLOOD OF REPROACHES HE TOOK HER BY THE ARM AND LED HER OUT INTO THE PASSAGE
6906-65918-0048 WAS THIS A COMEDY THAT HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR THEIR BENEFIT EVIDENTLY NOT SINCE THEIR ARRIVAL HAD NOT BEEN EXPECTED BUT THE PRIEST WHOSE CHARACTER HAD BEEN SO PLAINLY REVEALED BY THIS QUARREL WITH HIS DOMESTIC WAS NOT A MAN TO THEIR TASTE
6906-65918-0049 AT LEAST HE WAS EVIDENTLY NOT THE MAN THEY HAD HOPED TO FIND NOT THE AUXILIARY WHOSE ASSISTANCE WAS INDISPENSABLE TO THE SUCCESS OF THEIR PLANS YET THEY DID NOT EXCHANGE A WORD THEY LISTENED
6906-65918-0050 THEY HEARD THE SOUND AS OF A DISCUSSION IN THE PASSAGE THE MASTER SPOKE IN LOW TONES BUT WITH AN UNMISTAKABLE ACCENT OF COMMAND THE SERVANT UTTERED AN ASTONISHED EXCLAMATION BUT THE LISTENERS COULD NOT DISTINGUISH A WORD
6906-65918-0051 SOON THE PRIEST RE ENTERED THE APARTMENT I HOPE GENTLEMEN HE SAID WITH A DIGNITY THAT COULD NOT FAIL TO CHECK ANY ATTEMPT AT RAILLERY THAT YOU WILL EXCUSE THIS RIDICULOUS SCENE
6906-65918-0052 IS NOT SO POOR AS SHE SAYS
6906-65918-0053 HAD THE MUCH LAMENTED CHICKEN CONSTITUTED THE DINNER THE RATIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN SHORT
6906-65918-0054 THOUGH IT WAS TWO O'CLOCK AND HE HAD EATEN NOTHING SINCE THE PREVIOUS EVENING THE SUDDEN ARRIVAL OF THE FORMER MASTERS OF SAIRMEUSE FILLED HIS HEART WITH GLOOMY FOREBODINGS THEIR COMING HE BELIEVED
6906-65918-0055 THE GREATEST MISFORTUNES SO WHILE HE PLAYED WITH HIS KNIFE AND FORK PRETENDING TO EAT HE WAS REALLY OCCUPIED IN WATCHING HIS GUESTS AND IN STUDYING THEM WITH ALL THE PENETRATION OF A PRIEST
6906-65918-0056 THE DUC DE SAIRMEUSE WAS FIFTY SEVEN BUT LOOKED CONSIDERABLY YOUNGER THE STORMS OF HIS YOUTH THE DISSIPATION OF HIS RIPER YEARS THE GREAT EXCESSES OF EVERY KIND IN WHICH HE HAD INDULGED HAD NOT IMPAIRED HIS IRON CONSTITUTION IN THE LEAST
6906-65918-0057 OF HERCULEAN BUILD HE WAS EXTREMELY PROUD OF HIS STRENGTH AND OF HIS HANDS WHICH WERE WELL FORMED BUT LARGE FIRMLY KNIT AND POWERFUL
6906-65918-0058 SUCH HANDS AS RIGHTLY BELONGED TO A GENTLEMAN WHOSE ANCESTORS HAD GIVEN MANY A CRUSHING BLOW WITH PONDEROUS BATTLE AXE IN THE CRUSADES HIS FACE REVEALED HIS CHARACTER
6906-65918-0059 HE POSSESSED ALL THE GRACES AND ALL THE VICES OF A COURTIER HE WAS AT THE SAME TIME SPIRITUEL AND IGNORANT SCEPTICAL AND VIOLENTLY IMBUED WITH THE PREJUDICES OF HIS CLASS
6906-65918-0060 THOUGH LESS ROBUST THAN HIS FATHER MARTIAL WAS A NO LESS DISTINGUISHED LOOKING CAVALIER IT WAS NOT STRANGE THAT WOMEN RAVED OVER HIS BLUE EYES AND THE BEAUTIFUL BLOND HAIR WHICH HE INHERITED FROM HIS MOTHER
6906-65918-0061 TO HIS FATHER HE OWED ENERGY COURAGE AND IT MUST ALSO BE ADDED PERVERSITY BUT HE WAS HIS SUPERIOR IN EDUCATION AND IN INTELLECT IF HE SHARED HIS FATHER'S PREJUDICES
6906-65918-0062 HE HAD NOT ADOPTED THEM WITHOUT WEIGHING THEM CAREFULLY WHAT THE FATHER MIGHT DO IN A MOMENT OF EXCITEMENT THE SON WAS CAPABLE OF DOING IN COLD BLOOD IT WAS THUS THAT THE ABBE WITH RARE SAGACITY
6906-65918-0063 SO IT WAS WITH GREAT SORROW BUT WITHOUT SURPRISE THAT HE HEARD THE DUKE ADVANCE ON THE QUESTIONS OF THE DAY THE IMPOSSIBLE IDEAS SHARED BY NEARLY ALL THE EMIGRES KNOWING THE CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY AND THE STATE OF PUBLIC OPINION
6906-65918-0064 BUT UPON THIS SUBJECT THE DUKE WOULD NOT PERMIT CONTRADICTION OR EVEN RAILLERY AND HE WAS FAST LOSING HIS TEMPER WHEN BIBIAINE APPEARED AT THE PARLOR DOOR
