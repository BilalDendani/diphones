5826-48845-0000 THE NEW PRIVATE SECRETARY INCOME TAX OFFICE APRIL EIGHTH EIGHTEEN
5826-48845-0001 MY DEAR LORD DE GUEST I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO ANSWER YOUR LETTER IT IS SO VERY KIND MORE THAN KIND AND ABOUT NOT WRITING BEFORE
5826-48845-0002 INDEED IT DIDN'T COME FROM NOT THINKING ABOUT YOU AND FIRST OF ALL ABOUT THE MONEY
5826-48845-0003 I REALLY FEEL THAT I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY TO YOU ABOUT IT WITHOUT APPEARING TO BE A SIMPLETON THE TRUTH IS I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO DO AND CAN ONLY TRUST TO YOU NOT TO PUT ME WRONG I HAVE AN IDEA THAT A MAN OUGHT NOT TO ACCEPT A PRESENT OF MONEY UNLESS FROM HIS FATHER OR SOMEBODY LIKE THAT
5826-48845-0004 IF YOU CHOOSE TO BE SO GENEROUS WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER THAT YOU SHOULD LEAVE IT ME IN YOUR WILL
5826-48845-0005 I'M SURE HE WOULDN'T WANT THAT SAID LADY JULIA BUT YOU MAY LIVE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS YOU KNOW
5826-48845-0006 VERY MUCH INDEED AND I THINK THAT HE IS BEHAVING VERY HANDSOMELY TO HIS NIECE BUT WHETHER IT WILL DO ME ANY GOOD THAT IS QUITE ANOTHER THING HOWEVER I SHALL CERTAINLY ACCEPT YOUR KIND INVITATION FOR EASTER AND FIND OUT WHETHER I HAVE A CHANCE OR NOT
5826-48845-0007 I MUST TELL YOU THAT SIR RAFFLE BUFFLE HAS MADE ME HIS PRIVATE SECRETARY BY WHICH I GET A HUNDRED A YEAR
5826-48845-0008 AND SEEMS TO LIKE TALKING ABOUT YOU VERY MUCH YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL THAT MEANS HE HAS SENT YOU EVER SO MANY MESSAGES BUT I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU WILL CARE TO GET THEM I AM TO GO TO HIM TO MORROW AND FROM ALL I HEAR I SHALL HAVE A HARD TIME OF IT
5826-48845-0009 BY GEORGE HE WILL SAID THE EARL POOR FELLOW BUT I THOUGHT A PRIVATE SECRETARY NEVER HAD ANYTHING TO DO SAID LADY JULIA I SHOULDN'T LIKE TO BE PRIVATE SECRETARY TO SIR RAFFLE MYSELF BUT HE'S YOUNG AND A HUNDRED A YEAR IS A GREAT THING
5826-48845-0010 WE ALWAYS USED TO BE ASKING FOR SOME ONE TO MUFFLE THE BUFFLE
5826-48845-0011 GIVE MY KIND REGARDS TO LADY JULIA AND TELL HER HOW VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HER I AM I CANNOT EXPRESS THE GRATITUDE WHICH I OWE TO YOU BUT PRAY BELIEVE ME MY DEAR LORD DE GUEST ALWAYS VERY FAITHFULLY YOURS JOHN EAMES
5826-48845-0012 IT WAS LATE BEFORE EAMES HAD FINISHED HIS LETTER HE HAD BEEN MAKING HIMSELF READY FOR HIS EXODUS FROM THE BIG ROOM
5826-48845-0013 I SAY JOHNNY I CONGRATULATE YOU MOST HEARTILY I DO INDEED THANK YOU OLD FELLOW
5826-48845-0014 AND THEN SUCH A SNUG ROOM TO YOURSELF
5826-48845-0015 BUT JOHNNY I ALWAYS KNEW YOU'D COME TO SOMETHING MORE THAN COMMON I ALWAYS SAID SO THERE'S NOTHING UNCOMMON ABOUT THIS EXCEPT THAT FITZ SAYS THAT OLD HUFFLE SCUFFLE MAKES HIMSELF UNCOMMON NASTY NEVER MIND WHAT FITZ SAYS IT'S ALL JEALOUSY
5826-48845-0016 I THINK YOU ALWAYS DO HAVE IT ALL YOUR OWN WAY ARE YOU NEARLY READY WELL NOT QUITE DON'T WAIT FOR ME CAUDLE OH I'LL WAIT I DON'T MIND WAITING THEY'LL KEEP DINNER FOR US IF WE BOTH STAY BESIDES WHAT MATTERS I'D DO MORE THAN THAT FOR YOU
5826-48845-0017 I HAVE SOME IDEA OF WORKING ON TILL EIGHT AND HAVING A CHOP SENT IN SAID JOHNNY BESIDES I'VE GOT SOMEWHERE TO CALL BY MYSELF THEN CRADELL ALMOST CRIED HE REMAINED SILENT FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES STRIVING TO MASTER HIS EMOTION
5826-48845-0018 WHAT A GOOSE YOU ARE DO YOU SAY I'M CHANGED BECAUSE I WANT TO DINE IN THE CITY IT'S ALL BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO WALK HOME WITH ME AS WE USED TO DO I'M NOT SUCH A GOOSE BUT WHAT I CAN SEE BUT JOHNNY I SUPPOSE I MUSTN'T CALL YOU JOHNNY NOW
5826-48845-0019 DON'T BE SUCH A CON FOUNDED THEN EAMES GOT UP AND WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM
5826-48845-0020 BUT HOW WOULD YOU FEEL WHIMPERED CRADELL WHO HAD NEVER SUCCEEDED IN PUTTING HIMSELF QUITE ON A PAR WITH HIS FRIEND EVEN IN HIS OWN ESTIMATION SINCE THAT GLORIOUS VICTORY AT THE RAILWAY STATION IF HE COULD ONLY HAVE THRASHED LUPEX AS JOHNNY HAD THRASHED CROSBIE
5826-48845-0021 THEN INDEED THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN EQUAL A PAIR OF HEROES BUT HE HAD NOT DONE SO HE HAD NEVER TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE WAS A COWARD BUT HE CONSIDERED THAT CIRCUMSTANCES HAD BEEN SPECIALLY UNKIND TO HIM
5826-48845-0022 I HATE ALL THAT KIND OF THING YOU NEVER OUGHT TO SUPPOSE THAT A MAN WILL GIVE HIMSELF AIRS BUT WAIT TILL HE DOES I DON'T BELIEVE I SHALL REMAIN WITH OLD SCUFFLES ABOVE A MONTH OR TWO FROM ALL THAT I CAN HEAR THAT'S AS MUCH AS ANY ONE CAN BEAR
5826-48845-0023 THEN CRADELL BY DEGREES BECAME HAPPY AND CORDIAL AND DURING THE WHOLE WALK FLATTERED EAMES WITH ALL THE FLATTERY OF WHICH HE WAS MASTER AND JOHNNY THOUGH HE DID PROFESS HIMSELF TO BE AVERSE TO ALL THAT KIND OF THING WAS NEVERTHELESS OPEN TO FLATTERY
5826-48845-0024 I DON'T SUPPOSE HE'D EVER THINK OF ASKING YOU TO DO SUCH A THING UNLESS HE WAS IN A VERY GREAT HURRY OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND LOOK HERE JOHNNY SAID CRADELL AS THEY GOT INTO ONE OF THE STREETS BORDERING ON BURTON CRESCENT YOU KNOW THE LAST THING IN THE WORLD I SHOULD LIKE TO DO WOULD BE TO OFFEND YOU
5826-48845-0025 AND STOPPING CRADELL AS WELL THE EXCLAMATION WAS MADE IN A DEEP ANGRY VOICE WHICH ATTRACTED THE NOTICE OF ONE OR TWO WHO WERE PASSING JOHNNY WAS VERY WRONG WRONG TO UTTER ANY CURSE VERY WRONG TO EJACULATE THAT CURSE AGAINST A HUMAN BEING
5826-48845-0026 AND ESPECIALLY WRONG TO FULMINATE IT AGAINST A WOMAN A WOMAN WHOM HE HAD PROFESSED TO LOVE
5826-48845-0027 I ONLY MEANT TO SAY SAID CRADELL I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE IN THE MATTER THEN NEVER MENTION HER NAME TO ME AGAIN AND AS TO TALKING TO HER YOU MAY TALK TO HER TILL YOU'RE BOTH BLUE IN THE FACE IF YOU PLEASE OH I DIDN'T KNOW
5826-48845-0028 YOU DIDN'T SEEM TO LIKE IT THE OTHER DAY I WAS A FOOL THE OTHER DAY A CONFOUNDED FOOL AND SO I HAVE BEEN ALL MY LIFE AMELIA ROPER LOOK HERE CAUDLE
5826-48845-0029 JUST LET HER HAVE HER FLING NEVER MIND ME I'LL AMUSE MYSELF WITH MISSUS LUPEX OR MISS SPRUCE BUT THERE'LL BE THE DEUCE TO PAY WITH MISSUS LUPEX SHE'S AS CROSS AS POSSIBLE ALREADY WHENEVER AMELIA SPEAKS TO ME
5826-48845-0030 AND ON THAT HE FELT HIMSELF EQUAL TO ANY MAN IT WAS NO DOUBT TRUE THAT EAMES HAD THRASHED A MAN AND THAT HE HAD NOT IT WAS TRUE ALSO THAT EAMES HAD RISEN TO VERY HIGH PLACE IN THE SOCIAL WORLD HAVING BECOME A PRIVATE SECRETARY
5826-48845-0031 BUT FOR A DANGEROUS MYSTERIOUS OVERWHELMING LIFE ENVELOPING INTRIGUE WAS NOT HE THE ACKNOWLEDGED HERO OF SUCH AN AFFAIR HE HAD PAID VERY DEARLY BOTH IN POCKET AND IN COMFORT FOR THE BLESSING OF MISSUS LUPEX'S SOCIETY
5826-48845-0032 AND MORE LIFE ENVELOPING WHEREAS IT WOULD NOT BECOME MORE DANGEROUS SEEING THAT MISTER LUPEX COULD HARDLY FIND HIMSELF TO BE AGGRIEVED BY SUCH A PROCEEDING THE WHOLE NUMBER OF MISSUS ROPER'S BOARDERS WERE ASSEMBLED AT DINNER THAT DAY
5826-48845-0033 AND JOHNNY HAD THEREBY BECOME THE MARK OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HERO WORSHIP OH INDEED SAID MISSUS ROPER AN APPY WOMAN YOUR MOTHER WILL BE WHEN SHE HEARS IT BUT I ALWAYS SAID YOU'D COME DOWN RIGHT SIDE UPPERMOST HANDSOME IS AS HANDSOME DOES SAID MISS SPRUCE
5826-48845-0034 OH MISTER EAMES EXCLAIMED MISSUS LUPEX WITH GRACEFUL ENTHUSIASM I WISH YOU JOY FROM THE VERY DEPTH OF MY HEART IT IS SUCH AN ELEGANT APPOINTMENT ACCEPT THE HAND OF A TRUE AND DISINTERESTED FRIEND SAID LUPEX
5826-48845-0035 AND JOHNNY DID ACCEPT THE HAND THOUGH IT WAS VERY DIRTY AND STAINED ALL OVER WITH PAINT AMELIA STOOD APART AND CONVEYED HER CONGRATULATIONS BY A GLANCE OR I MIGHT BETTER SAY BY A SERIES OF GLANCES AND NOW
5826-48845-0036 NOW THAT YOU ARE ROLLING IN WEALTH AND PROSPERITY AND THEN BEFORE THEY WENT DOWNSTAIRS SHE DID WHISPER ONE WORD TO HIM OH I AM SO HAPPY JOHN SO VERY HAPPY BOTHER SAID JOHNNY IN A TONE QUITE LOUD ENOUGH TO REACH THE LADY'S EAR
5826-48845-0037 SHE HAD BEEN EMPLOYED IN WRINGING IT FOR SOME DAYS PAST
5826-48845-0038 IT HAD BEEN CLEAR ENOUGH TO HER THAT EAMES HAD BEEN PIQUED BY HER OVERTURES TO CRADELL AND SHE HAD THEREFORE TO PLAY OUT THAT GAME
5826-48845-0039 I HATE YOUR SUDDEN RISES THEY DO SO OFTEN MAKE A MAN UPSETTING I SHOULD LIKE TO TRY MYSELF ALL THE SAME SAID CRADELL
5826-48845-0040 HE THAT WAS WORRIED BY THE BULL
5826-48845-0041 AND AMELIA GAVE HER HEAD A LITTLE TOSS AND THEN SMILED ARCHLY IN A MANNER WHICH TO CRADELL'S EYES WAS REALLY VERY BECOMING BUT HE SAW THAT MISSUS LUPEX WAS LOOKING AT HIM FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE AND HE COULD NOT QUITE ENJOY THE GOODS WHICH THE GODS HAD PROVIDED FOR HIM
5826-48845-0042 WHEN THE LADIES LEFT THE DINING ROOM LUPEX AND THE TWO YOUNG MEN DREW THEIR CHAIRS NEAR THE FIRE AND EACH PREPARED FOR HIMSELF A MODERATE POTATION EAMES MADE A LITTLE ATTEMPT AT LEAVING THE ROOM BUT HE WAS IMPLORED BY LUPEX
5826-48845-0043 WITH SUCH EARNEST PROTESTATIONS OF FRIENDSHIP TO REMAIN AND WAS SO WEAKLY FEARFUL OF BEING CHARGED WITH GIVING HIMSELF AIRS THAT HE DID AS HE WAS DESIRED AND HERE MISTER EAMES IS TO YOUR VERY GOOD HEALTH SAID LUPEX
5826-48845-0044 AND WISHING YOU MANY YEARS TO ENJOY YOUR OFFICIAL PROSPERITY THANK YE SAID EAMES I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE PROSPERITY BUT I'M JUST AS MUCH OBLIGED YES SIR WHEN I SEE A YOUNG MAN OF YOUR AGE BEGINNING TO RISE IN THE WORLD I KNOW HE'LL GO ON
5826-48845-0045 NOW LOOK AT ME MISTER EAMES MISTER CRADELL HERE'S YOUR VERY GOOD HEALTH AND MAY ALL UNKINDNESS BE DROWNED IN THE FLOWING BOWL LOOK AT ME MISTER EAMES I'VE NEVER RISEN IN THE WORLD I'VE NEVER DONE ANY GOOD IN THE WORLD AND NEVER SHALL
5826-48845-0046 OH MISTER LUPEX DON'T SAY THAT AH BUT I DO SAY IT
5826-48845-0047 AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY I NEVER GOT A CHANCE WHEN I WAS YOUNG
5826-48845-0048 A STAR YOU KNOW TO LET ME PAINT HIS PORTRAIT WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE SUCH A ONE LET US SAY AS YOUR FRIEND SIR RAFFLE
5826-48845-0049 WELL I SUPPOSE HE'S PRETTY MUCH KNOWN IN THE WORLD ISN'T HE OR LORD DERBY OR MISTER SPURGEON YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IF I'D GOT SUCH A CHANCE AS THAT WHEN I WAS YOUNG
5826-48845-0050 YOU'VE GOT THE CHANCE NOW BUT I NEVER HAD IT WHEREUPON MISTER LUPEX FINISHED HIS FIRST MEASURE OF GIN AND WATER IT'S A VERY QUEER THING LIFE IS CONTINUED LUPEX
5826-48845-0051 AND THOUGH HE DID NOT AT ONCE GO TO WORK BOLDLY AT THE MIXING OF ANOTHER GLASS OF TODDY HE BEGAN GRADUALLY AND AS IF BY INSTINCT TO FINGER THE THINGS WHICH WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR THAT OPERATION A VERY QUEER THING
5826-48845-0052 NOW REMEMBER YOUNG GENTLEMEN I'M NOT DENYING THAT SUCCESS IN LIFE WILL DEPEND UPON GOOD CONDUCT OF COURSE IT DOES BUT THEN HOW OFTEN GOOD CONDUCT COMES FROM SUCCESS
5826-48845-0053 I COULD HAVE DRUNK CLARET AND CHAMPAGNE JUST AS WELL AS GIN AND WATER AND WORN RUFFLES TO MY SHIRT AS GRACEFULLY AS MANY A FELLOW WHO USED TO BE VERY FOND OF ME AND NOW WON'T SPEAK TO ME IF HE MEETS ME IN THE STREETS I NEVER GOT A CHANCE NEVER
5826-48845-0054 BUT IT'S NOT TOO LATE YET MISTER LUPEX SAID EAMES YES IT IS EAMES YES IT IS AND NOW MISTER LUPEX HAD GRASPED THE GIN BOTTLE IT'S TOO LATE NOW THE GAME'S OVER AND THE MATCH IS LOST THE TALENT IS HERE
5826-48845-0055 I'M AS SURE OF THAT NOW AS EVER I WAS I'VE NEVER DOUBTED MY OWN ABILITY NEVER FOR A MOMENT THERE ARE MEN THIS VERY DAY MAKING A THOUSAND A YEAR OFF THEIR EASELS
5826-48845-0056 OR SO GOOD A FEELING IN COLOURS I COULD NAME THEM ONLY I WON'T AND WHY SHOULDN'T YOU TRY AGAIN SAID EAMES IF I WERE TO PAINT THE FINEST PIECE THAT EVER DELIGHTED THE EYE OF MAN WHO WOULD COME AND LOOK AT IT
5826-48845-0057 WHO WOULD HAVE ENOUGH BELIEF IN ME TO COME AS FAR AS THIS PLACE AND SEE IF IT WERE TRUE NO EAMES I KNOW MY OWN POSITION AND MY OWN WAYS AND I KNOW MY OWN WEAKNESS I COULDN'T DO A DAY'S WORK NOW UNLESS I WERE CERTAIN OF GETTING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SHILLINGS AT THE END OF IT
5826-48845-0058 THAT'S WHAT A MAN COMES TO WHEN THINGS HAVE GONE AGAINST HIM BUT I THOUGHT MEN GOT LOTS OF MONEY BY SCENE PAINTING
5826-48845-0059 YOU'LL BEWARE OF MARRYING TOO SOON IN LIFE I THINK A MAN SHOULD MARRY EARLY IF HE MARRIES WELL SAID EAMES DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME CONTINUED LUPEX IT ISN'T ABOUT MISSUS L I'M SPEAKING I'VE ALWAYS REGARDED MY WIFE AS A VERY FASCINATING WOMAN
5826-48845-0060 IF A MAN DON'T STAND BY HIS WIFE WHOM WILL HE STAND BY I BLAME NO ONE BUT MYSELF BUT I DO SAY THIS I NEVER HAD A CHANCE
5826-48845-0061 AND AS HE REPEATED THE WORDS FOR THE THIRD TIME HIS LIPS WERE ALREADY FIXED TO THE RIM OF HIS TUMBLER AT THIS MOMENT THE DOOR OF THE DINING ROOM WAS OPENED AND MISSUS LUPEX PUT IN HER HEAD LUPEX SHE SAID WHAT ARE YOU DOING
5826-48845-0062 YES MY DEAR I CAN'T SAY I'M DOING ANYTHING AT THE PRESENT MOMENT I WAS GIVING A LITTLE ADVICE TO THESE YOUNG GENTLEMEN MISTER CRADELL I WONDER AT YOU AND MISTER EAMES I WONDER AT YOU TOO IN YOUR POSITION LUPEX COME UPSTAIRS AT ONCE
5826-48845-0063 I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU THIS HALF HOUR I'VE GOT SUCH A PUZZLE FOR YOU AND SHE MADE WAY FOR HIM TO A CHAIR WHICH WAS BETWEEN HERSELF AND THE WALL CRADELL LOOKED HALF AFRAID OF HIS FORTUNES AS HE TOOK THE PROFFERED SEAT
