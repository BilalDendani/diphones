7871-107222-0000 EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT THE MOON IS INHABITED BY A MAN
7871-107222-0001 THAT HE IS BEYOND THE REACH OF DEATH HE HAS ONCE VISITED THIS EARTH IF THE NURSERY RHYME IS TO BE CREDITED WHEN IT ASSERTS THAT THE MAN IN THE MOON CAME DOWN TOO SOON
7871-107222-0002 THE SAME AUTHORITY DOES NOT STATE THE STORY AS TOLD BY NURSES IS THAT THIS MAN WAS FOUND BY MOSES GATHERING STICKS ON A SABBATH AND THAT FOR THIS CRIME HE WAS DOOMED TO RESIDE IN THE MOON
7871-107222-0003 TILL THE END OF ALL THINGS AND THEY REFER
7871-107222-0004 AND WHILE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE IN THE WILDERNESS THEY FOUND A MAN THAT GATHERED STICKS UPON THE SABBATH DAY AND THEY THAT FOUND HIM GATHERING STICKS BROUGHT HIM UNTO MOSES AND AARON
7871-107222-0005 AND THEY PUT HIM IN WARD BECAUSE IT WAS NOT DECLARED WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO HIM AND THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES THE MAN SHALL BE SURELY PUT TO DEATH ALL THE CONGREGATION
7871-107222-0006 SHALL STONE HIM WITH STONES WITHOUT THE CAMP AND ALL THE CONGREGATION BROUGHT HIM WITHOUT THE CAMP AND STONED HIM WITH STONES TILL HE DIED

7871-107222-0011 A WARNING TO ALL SABBATH BREAKERS THEREUPON THE STRANGER VANISHED AND THE MAN WAS CAUGHT UP WITH HIS STOCK AND HIS FAGOT INTO THE MOON
7871-107222-0012 AND NOW AT FULL MOON HE IS TO BE SEEN SEATED WITH HIS BUNDLE OF FAGOTS ON HIS BACK
7871-107222-0013 THE STORY GOES THAT A MAN AND A WOMAN STAND IN THE MOON THE MAN BECAUSE HE STREWED BRAMBLES AND THORNS ON THE CHURCH PATH SO AS TO HINDER PEOPLE FROM ATTENDING MASS ON SUNDAY MORNING THE WOMAN BECAUSE SHE MADE BUTTER ON THAT DAY
7871-107222-0014 THE MAN CARRIES HIS BUNDLE OF THORNS THE WOMAN HER BUTTER TUB A SIMILAR TALE IS TOLD IN SWABIA AND IN MARKEN
7871-107222-0015 SUPERSTITIOUS PEOPLE ASSERT THAT THE BLACK FLECKS IN THE MOON ARE A MAN WHO GATHERED WOOD ON A SABBATH AND IS THEREFORE
7871-107222-0016 THE DUTCH HOUSEHOLD MYTH IS THAT THE UNHAPPY MAN WAS CAUGHT STEALING VEGETABLES DANTE CALLS HIM CAIN

7871-107222-0018 TELL I PRAY THEE WHENCE THE GLOOMY SPOTS UPON THIS BODY WHICH BELOW ON EARTH GIVE RISE TO TALK OF CAIN IN FABLING QUAINT
7871-107222-0019 CHAUCER IN THE TESTAMENT OF CRESSIDE ADVERTS TO THE MAN IN THE MOON AND ATTRIBUTES TO HIM THE SAME IDEA OF THEFT OF LADY CYNTHIA OR THE MOON HE SAYS
7871-107222-0020 HER GITE WAS GRAY AND FULL OF SPOTTIS BLAKE AND ON HER BREST
7871-107222-0021 BERING A BUSH OF THORNIS ON HIS BACKE WHICHE FOR HIS THEFT
7871-107222-0022 RITSON AMONG HIS ANCIENT SONGS
7871-107222-0023 ON THE MAN IN THE MOON BUT IN VERY OBSCURE LANGUAGE THE FIRST VERSE ALTERED INTO MORE MODERN ORTHOGRAPHY
7871-107222-0024 MAN IN THE MOON STAND AND STIT ON HIS BOT FORK HIS BURDEN HE BEARETH IT IS MUCH WONDER THAT HE DO NA DOUN SLIT FOR DOUBT LEST HE FALL HE SHUDD'RETH AND SHIVERETH

7871-107222-0026 IN COMMENTING ON THE DISPERSED SHADOWS IN THE MOON THUS ALLUDES TO THE VULGAR BELIEF
7871-107222-0027 RUSTICUS IN LUNA
7871-107222-0028 MONSTRAT PER OPINAS NULLI PRODESSE RAPINAS
7871-107222-0029 WHICH MAY BE TRANSLATED THUS DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL THE RUSTIC IN THE MOON WHO CARRIES THE FAGOT OF STICKS SO THAT ONE VULGARLY SPEAKING SAYS SEE THE RUSTIC IN THE MOON HOW HIS BUNDLE WEIGHS HIM DOWN
7871-107222-0030 ONE MUST COME IN WITH A BUSH OF THORNS AND A LANTERN AND SAY HE COMES IN TO DISFIGURE OR TO PRESENT THE PERSON OF MOONSHINE AND THE
7871-107222-0031 I THE MAN IN THE MOON THIS THORN BUSH MY THORN BUSH AND THIS DOG MY DOG
7871-107222-0032 ALSO TEMPEST ACT TWO SCENE TWO
7871-107222-0033 HAST THOU NOT DROPT FROM HEAVEN
7871-107222-0034 AND I DO ADORE THEE MY MISTRESS SHOWED ME THEE AND THY DOG AND THY BUSH THE DOG I HAVE MYSELF HAD POINTED OUT TO ME BY AN OLD DEVONSHIRE CRONE
7871-107222-0035 IF POPULAR SUPERSTITION PLACES A DOG IN THE MOON IT PUTS A LAMB IN THE SUN
7871-107222-0036 MAY BEHOLD IN THE ORB THE LAMB AND FLAG I BELIEVE THIS IDEA OF LOCATING ANIMALS IN THE TWO GREAT LUMINARIES OF HEAVEN TO BE VERY ANCIENT
7871-107222-0037 THE ROOF OF THE CHANCEL IS DIVIDED INTO COMPARTMENTS
7871-107222-0038 RUDELY YET EFFECTIVELY PAINTED BESIDES THESE SYMBOLS IS DELINEATED IN EACH COMPARTMENT AN ORB OF HEAVEN THE SUN THE MOON AND TWO STARS ARE PLACED AT THE FEET OF THE ANGEL
7871-107222-0039 THE BULL THE LION AND THE EAGLE THE REPRESENTATION OF THE MOON IS AS BELOW IN THE DISK IS THE CONVENTIONAL MAN WITH HIS BUNDLE OF STICKS BUT WITHOUT THE DOG
7871-107222-0040 THIRTEEN THIRTY FIVE BEARING THE MAN IN THE MOON
7871-107222-0041 THE DEED IS ONE OF CONVEYANCE OF A MESSUAGE BARN AND FOUR ACRES OF GROUND IN THE PARISH OF KINGSTON ON THAMES FROM WALTER DE GRENDESSE CLERK TO MARGARET HIS MOTHER ON THE SEAL
7871-107222-0042 WE SEE THE MAN CARRYING HIS STICKS AND THE MOON SURROUNDS HIM THERE ARE ALSO
7871-107222-0043 PERHAPS TO SHOW THAT HE IS IN THE SKY THE LEGEND ON THE SEAL READS
7871-107222-0044 AND SHE HAS A BUTTER TUB WITH HER IN OTHER LOCALITIES
7871-107222-0045 THE BELIEF IN THE MOON MAN SEEMS TO EXIST AMONG THE NATIVES OF BRITISH COLUMBIA FOR I READ IN ONE OF MISTER DUNCAN'S LETTERS TO THE CHURCH MISSIONARY SOCIETY
7871-107222-0046 ONE VERY DARK NIGHT I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS A MOON TO SEE ON THE BEACH ON GOING TO SEE THERE WAS AN ILLUMINATED DISK WITH THE FIGURE OF A MAN UPON IT THE WATER WAS THEN VERY LOW
7871-107222-0047 AND ONE OF THE CONJURING PARTIES HAD LIT UP THIS DISK AT THE WATER'S EDGE THEY HAD MADE IT OF WAX WITH GREAT EXACTNESS AND PRESENTLY IT WAS AT FULL IT WAS AN IMPOSING SIGHT
7871-107222-0048 NOW LET US TURN TO SCANDINAVIAN MYTHOLOGY
7871-107222-0049 AND CARRIED THEM UP TO HEAVEN THEIR NAMES WERE HJUKI AND BIL THEY HAD BEEN DRAWING WATER FROM THE WELL
7871-107222-0050 IN THE BUCKET SA GR SUSPENDED FROM THE POLE SIMUL WHICH THEY BORE UPON THEIR SHOULDERS
7871-107222-0051 AND SO THE SWEDISH PEASANTRY EXPLAIN THESE SPOTS TO THIS DAY AS REPRESENTING A BOY AND A GIRL BEARING A PAIL OF WATER BETWEEN THEM ARE WE NOT REMINDED AT ONCE OF OUR NURSERY RHYME
7871-107222-0052 JACK AND JILL WENT UP A HILL TO FETCH A PAIL OF WATER JACK FELL DOWN AND BROKE HIS CROWN AND JILL CAME TUMBLING AFTER
7871-107222-0053 THIS VERSE WHICH TO US SEEMS AT FIRST SIGHT NONSENSE I HAVE NO HESITATION IN SAYING HAS A HIGH ANTIQUITY AND REFERS TO THE EDDAIC HJUKI AND BIL THE NAMES INDICATE AS MUCH HJUKI IN NORSE WOULD BE PRONOUNCED
7871-107222-0054 WHICH WOULD READILY BECOME JACK AND BIL FOR THE SAKE OF EUPHONY AND IN ORDER TO GIVE A FEMALE NAME TO ONE OF THE CHILDREN WOULD BECOME JILL THE FALL OF JACK
7871-107222-0055 SIMPLY REPRESENT THE VANISHING OF ONE MOON SPOT AFTER ANOTHER AS THE MOON WANES BUT THE OLD NORSE MYTH HAD A DEEPER SIGNIFICATION THAN MERELY AN EXPLANATION OF THE MOON SPOTS HJUKI IS DERIVED FROM THE VERB JAKKA
7871-107222-0056 TO HEAP OR PILE TOGETHER TO ASSEMBLE AND INCREASE AND BIL FROM BILA TO BREAK UP OR DISSOLVE HJUKI AND BIL THEREFORE SIGNIFY NOTHING MORE THAN THE WAXING
7871-107222-0057 AND THE WATER THEY ARE REPRESENTED AS BEARING SIGNIFIES THE FACT THAT THE RAINFALL DEPENDS ON THE PHASES OF THE MOON WAXING AND WANING WERE INDIVIDUALIZED AND THE METEOROLOGICAL FACT OF THE CONNECTION OF THE RAIN WITH THE MOON
7871-107222-0058 WAS REPRESENTED BY THE CHILDREN AS WATER BEARERS
7871-107222-0059 STICKS OR VEGETABLES THE THEFT WAS IN SOME PLACES EXCHANGED FOR SABBATH BREAKING
7871-107222-0060 OF THE STICK GATHERER THE INDIAN SUPERSTITION IS WORTH EXAMINING BECAUSE OF THE CONNECTION EXISTING BETWEEN INDIAN AND EUROPEAN MYTHOLOGY
7871-107222-0061 ACCORDING TO A BUDDHIST LEGEND S ACKYAMUNNI HIMSELF IN ONE OF HIS EARLIER STAGES OF EXISTENCE WAS A HARE AND LIVED IN FRIENDSHIP WITH A FOX AND AN APE IN ORDER TO TEST THE VIRTUE OF THE BODHISATTWA
7871-107222-0062 INDRA CAME TO THE FRIENDS
7871-107222-0063 ASKING FOR FOOD HARE APE AND FOX WENT FORTH IN QUEST OF VICTUALS FOR THEIR GUEST THE TWO LATTER RETURNED FROM THEIR FORAGING EXPEDITION SUCCESSFUL BUT THE HARE HAD FOUND NOTHING THEN
7871-107222-0064 RATHER THAN THAT HE SHOULD TREAT THE OLD MAN WITH INHOSPITALITY THE HARE HAD A FIRE KINDLED AND CAST HIMSELF INTO THE FLAMES
