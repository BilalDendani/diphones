731-366-0000 AND I REMAINED IDLE IN A PAUSE OF CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER I SHOULD LEAVE MY LABOUR FOR THE NIGHT OR HASTEN ITS CONCLUSION BY AN UNREMITTING ATTENTION TO IT AS I SAT A TRAIN OF REFLECTION OCCURRED TO ME WHICH LED ME TO CONSIDER THE EFFECTS OF
731-366-0001 AND FILLED IT FOREVER WITH THE BITTEREST REMORSE I WAS NOW ABOUT TO FORM ANOTHER BEING OF WHOSE DISPOSITIONS I WAS ALIKE IGNORANT SHE MIGHT BECOME TEN THOUSAND TIMES MORE MALIGNANT THAN HER MATE AND DELIGHT FOR ITS OWN SAKE
731-366-0002 TO THE SUPERIOR BEAUTY OF MAN SHE MIGHT QUIT HIM AND HE
731-366-0003 WOULD BE CHILDREN AND A RACE OF DEVILS WOULD BE PROPAGATED UPON THE EARTH WHO MIGHT MAKE THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE SPECIES OF MAN A CONDITION PRECARIOUS AND FULL OF TERROR HAD I RIGHT FOR MY OWN BENEFIT
731-366-0004 TO INFLICT THIS CURSE UPON EVERLASTING GENERATIONS
731-366-0005 AND MY HEART FAILED WITHIN ME WHEN ON LOOKING UP I SAW BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON THE DAEMON AT THE CASEMENT A GHASTLY GRIN WRINKLED HIS LIPS AS HE GAZED ON ME
731-366-0006 AND TREMBLING WITH PASSION TORE TO PIECES THE THING ON WHICH I WAS ENGAGED THE WRETCH SAW ME DESTROY THE CREATURE ON WHOSE FUTURE EXISTENCE HE DEPENDED FOR HAPPINESS AND WITH A HOWL OF DEVILISH DESPAIR AND REVENGE
731-366-0007 SEVERAL HOURS PASSED AND I REMAINED NEAR MY WINDOW GAZING ON THE SEA IT WAS ALMOST MOTIONLESS FOR THE WINDS WERE HUSHED AND ALL NATURE REPOSED UNDER THE EYE OF THE QUIET MOON
731-366-0008 A FEW FISHING VESSELS ALONE SPECKED THE WATER AND NOW AND THEN THE GENTLE BREEZE WAFTED THE SOUND OF VOICES AS THE FISHERMEN CALLED TO ONE ANOTHER I FELT THE SILENCE ALTHOUGH I WAS HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF ITS EXTREME PROFUNDITY
731-366-0009 UNTIL MY EAR WAS SUDDENLY ARRESTED BY THE PADDLING OF OARS NEAR THE SHORE AND A PERSON LANDED CLOSE TO MY HOUSE IN A FEW MINUTES AFTER I HEARD THE CREAKING OF MY DOOR AS IF SOME ONE ENDEAVOURED TO OPEN IT SOFTLY
731-366-0010 I TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT I FELT A PRESENTIMENT OF WHO IT WAS
731-366-0011 BUT I WAS OVERCOME BY THE SENSATION OF HELPLESSNESS SO OFTEN FELT IN FRIGHTFUL DREAMS WHEN YOU IN VAIN ENDEAVOUR TO FLY FROM AN IMPENDING DANGER AND WAS ROOTED TO THE SPOT PRESENTLY I HEARD THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ALONG THE PASSAGE
731-366-0012 THE DOOR OPENED AND THE WRETCH WHOM I DREADED APPEARED SHUTTING THE DOOR HE APPROACHED ME AND SAID IN A SMOTHERED VOICE YOU HAVE DESTROYED THE WORK WHICH YOU BEGAN
731-366-0013 DO YOU DARE TO BREAK YOUR PROMISE I HAVE ENDURED TOIL AND MISERY I LEFT SWITZERLAND WITH YOU I CREPT ALONG THE SHORES OF THE RHINE AMONG ITS WILLOW ISLANDS AND OVER THE SUMMITS OF ITS HILLS
731-366-0014 I HAVE DWELT MANY MONTHS IN THE HEATHS OF ENGLAND AND AMONG THE DESERTS OF SCOTLAND I HAVE ENDURED INCALCULABLE FATIGUE AND COLD AND HUNGER DO YOU DARE DESTROY MY HOPES BEGONE
731-366-0015 REMEMBER THAT I HAVE POWER YOU BELIEVE YOURSELF MISERABLE BUT I CAN MAKE YOU SO WRETCHED THAT THE LIGHT OF DAY WILL BE HATEFUL TO YOU YOU ARE MY CREATOR
731-366-0016 THE MONSTER SAW MY DETERMINATION IN MY FACE AND GNASHED HIS TEETH IN THE IMPOTENCE OF ANGER SHALL EACH MAN CRIED HE FIND A WIFE FOR HIS BOSOM
731-366-0017 MAN YOU MAY HATE BUT BEWARE YOUR HOURS WILL PASS IN DREAD AND MISERY
731-366-0018 ARE YOU TO BE HAPPY WHILE I GROVEL IN THE INTENSITY OF MY WRETCHEDNESS YOU CAN BLAST MY OTHER PASSIONS BUT REVENGE REMAINS REVENGE HENCEFORTH DEARER THAN LIGHT OR FOOD
731-366-0019 THAT I MAY STING WITH ITS VENOM MAN YOU SHALL REPENT OF THE INJURIES YOU INFLICT DEVIL CEASE AND DO NOT POISON THE AIR WITH THESE SOUNDS OF MALICE
731-366-0020 WHILE MY IMAGINATION CONJURED UP A THOUSAND IMAGES TO TORMENT AND STING ME WHY HAD I NOT FOLLOWED HIM AND CLOSED WITH HIM IN MORTAL STRIFE BUT I HAD SUFFERED HIM TO DEPART
731-366-0021 ON YOUR WEDDING NIGHT THAT THEN WAS THE PERIOD FIXED FOR THE FULFILMENT OF MY DESTINY IN THAT HOUR I SHOULD DIE AND AT ONCE SATISFY AND EXTINGUISH HIS MALICE
731-366-0022 THE PROSPECT DID NOT MOVE ME TO FEAR YET WHEN I THOUGHT OF MY BELOVED ELIZABETH OF HER TEARS AND ENDLESS SORROW WHEN SHE SHOULD FIND HER LOVER SO BARBAROUSLY SNATCHED FROM HER TEARS
731-366-0023 THE FIRST I HAD SHED FOR MANY MONTHS STREAMED FROM MY EYES AND I RESOLVED NOT TO FALL BEFORE MY ENEMY WITHOUT A BITTER STRUGGLE THE NIGHT PASSED AWAY
731-366-0024 AND THE SUN ROSE FROM THE OCEAN MY FEELINGS BECAME CALMER IF IT MAY BE CALLED CALMNESS WHEN THE VIOLENCE OF RAGE SINKS INTO THE DEPTHS OF DESPAIR
731-366-0025 NAY A WISH THAT SUCH SHOULD PROVE THE FACT STOLE ACROSS ME I DESIRED THAT I MIGHT PASS MY LIFE ON THAT BARREN ROCK WEARILY IT IS TRUE
731-366-0026 I WALKED ABOUT THE ISLE LIKE A RESTLESS SPECTRE SEPARATED FROM ALL IT LOVED AND MISERABLE IN THE SEPARATION WHEN IT BECAME NOON AND THE SUN ROSE HIGHER
731-366-0027 YET STILL THE WORDS OF THE FIEND RANG IN MY EARS LIKE A DEATH KNELL THEY APPEARED LIKE A DREAM YET DISTINCT AND OPPRESSIVE AS A REALITY THE SUN HAD FAR DESCENDED
731-366-0028 HE SAID THAT HE WAS WEARING AWAY HIS TIME FRUITLESSLY WHERE HE WAS THAT LETTERS FROM THE FRIENDS HE HAD FORMED IN LONDON DESIRED HIS RETURN TO COMPLETE THE NEGOTIATION THEY HAD ENTERED INTO FOR HIS INDIAN ENTERPRISE
731-366-0029 BUT AS HIS JOURNEY TO LONDON MIGHT BE FOLLOWED EVEN SOONER THAN HE NOW CONJECTURED BY HIS LONGER VOYAGE HE ENTREATED ME TO BESTOW AS MUCH OF MY SOCIETY ON HIM AS I COULD SPARE HE BESOUGHT ME THEREFORE
731-366-0030 TO LEAVE MY SOLITARY ISLE AND TO MEET HIM AT PERTH THAT WE MIGHT PROCEED SOUTHWARDS TOGETHER THIS LETTER IN A DEGREE RECALLED ME TO LIFE AND I DETERMINED TO QUIT MY ISLAND AT THE EXPIRATION OF TWO DAYS
731-366-0031 YET BEFORE I DEPARTED THERE WAS A TASK TO PERFORM ON WHICH I SHUDDERED TO REFLECT I MUST PACK UP MY CHEMICAL INSTRUMENTS AND FOR THAT PURPOSE
731-366-0032 THE REMAINS OF THE HALF FINISHED CREATURE WHOM I HAD DESTROYED
731-366-0033 AND I ALMOST FELT AS IF I HAD MANGLED THE LIVING FLESH OF A HUMAN BEING I PAUSED TO COLLECT MYSELF AND THEN ENTERED THE CHAMBER WITH TREMBLING HAND I CONVEYED THE INSTRUMENTS OUT OF THE ROOM
731-366-0034 AND LAYING THEM UP DETERMINED TO THROW THEM INTO THE SEA THAT VERY NIGHT AND IN THE MEANTIME I SAT UPON THE BEACH EMPLOYED IN CLEANING AND ARRANGING MY CHEMICAL APPARATUS
731-366-0035 NOTHING COULD BE MORE COMPLETE THAN THE ALTERATION THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN MY FEELINGS SINCE THE NIGHT OF THE APPEARANCE OF THE DAEMON
731-366-0036 THE IDEA OF RENEWING MY LABOURS DID NOT FOR ONE INSTANT OCCUR TO ME
731-366-0037 BUT I DID NOT REFLECT THAT A VOLUNTARY ACT OF MINE COULD AVERT IT I HAD RESOLVED IN MY OWN MIND THAT TO CREATE ANOTHER LIKE THE FIEND I HAD FIRST MADE WOULD BE AN ACT OF THE BASEST AND MOST ATROCIOUS SELFISHNESS
731-366-0038 AND I BANISHED FROM MY MIND EVERY THOUGHT THAT COULD LEAD TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION BETWEEN TWO AND THREE IN THE MORNING THE MOON ROSE AND I THEN PUTTING MY BASKET ABOARD A LITTLE SKIFF
731-366-0039 AND AVOIDED WITH SHUDDERING ANXIETY ANY ENCOUNTER WITH MY FELLOW CREATURES AT ONE TIME THE MOON
731-366-0040 THAT I RESOLVED TO PROLONG MY STAY ON THE WATER AND FIXING THE RUDDER IN A DIRECT POSITION STRETCHED MYSELF AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT CLOUDS HID THE MOON EVERYTHING WAS OBSCURE
731-366-0041 THE WIND WAS HIGH AND THE WAVES CONTINUALLY THREATENED THE SAFETY OF MY LITTLE SKIFF
731-366-0042 THUS SITUATED MY ONLY RESOURCE WAS TO DRIVE BEFORE THE WIND I CONFESS THAT I FELT A FEW SENSATIONS OF TERROR I HAD NO COMPASS WITH ME
731-366-0043 I MIGHT BE DRIVEN INTO THE WIDE ATLANTIC AND FEEL ALL THE TORTURES OF STARVATION OR BE SWALLOWED UP IN THE IMMEASURABLE WATERS THAT ROARED AND BUFFETED AROUND ME I HAD ALREADY BEEN OUT MANY HOURS
731-366-0044 AND FELT THE TORMENT OF A BURNING THIRST A PRELUDE TO MY OTHER SUFFERINGS
731-366-0045 AND OF CLERVAL ALL LEFT BEHIND ON WHOM THE MONSTER MIGHT SATISFY HIS SANGUINARY AND MERCILESS PASSIONS THIS IDEA PLUNGED ME INTO A REVERIE SO DESPAIRING AND FRIGHTFUL
731-366-0046 THAT EVEN NOW WHEN THE SCENE IS ON THE POINT OF CLOSING BEFORE ME FOREVER I SHUDDER TO REFLECT ON IT SOME HOURS PASSED THUS BUT BY DEGREES AS THE SUN DECLINED TOWARDS THE HORIZON
731-366-0047 THE WIND DIED AWAY INTO A GENTLE BREEZE AND THE SEA BECAME FREE FROM BREAKERS BUT THESE GAVE PLACE TO A HEAVY SWELL I FELT SICK AND HARDLY ABLE TO HOLD THE RUDDER WHEN SUDDENLY
731-366-0048 I SAW A LINE OF HIGH LAND TOWARDS THE SOUTH ALMOST SPENT AS I WAS
731-366-0049 THIS SUDDEN CERTAINTY OF LIFE RUSHED LIKE A FLOOD OF WARM JOY TO MY HEART AND TEARS GUSHED FROM MY EYES
731-366-0050 EVEN IN THE EXCESS OF MISERY I CONSTRUCTED ANOTHER SAIL WITH A PART OF MY DRESS AND EAGERLY STEERED MY COURSE TOWARDS THE LAND IT HAD A WILD AND ROCKY APPEARANCE BUT AS I APPROACHED NEARER
731-366-0051 I EASILY PERCEIVED THE TRACES OF CULTIVATION I SAW VESSELS NEAR THE SHORE AND FOUND MYSELF SUDDENLY TRANSPORTED BACK TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF CIVILIZED MAN I CAREFULLY TRACED THE WINDINGS OF THE LAND
731-366-0052 AND HAILED A STEEPLE WHICH I AT LENGTH SAW ISSUING FROM BEHIND A SMALL PROMONTORY AS I WAS IN A STATE OF EXTREME DEBILITY
731-366-0053 I PERCEIVED A SMALL NEAT TOWN AND A GOOD HARBOUR WHICH I ENTERED MY HEART BOUNDING WITH JOY AT MY UNEXPECTED ESCAPE AS I WAS OCCUPIED IN FIXING THE BOAT AND ARRANGING THE SAILS
731-366-0054 SEVERAL PEOPLE CROWDED TOWARDS THE SPOT THEY SEEMED MUCH SURPRISED AT MY APPEARANCE BUT INSTEAD OF OFFERING ME ANY ASSISTANCE WHISPERED TOGETHER WITH GESTURES THAT AT ANY OTHER TIME
731-366-0055 MIGHT HAVE PRODUCED IN ME A SLIGHT SENSATION OF ALARM AS IT WAS I MERELY REMARKED THAT THEY SPOKE ENGLISH AND I THEREFORE ADDRESSED THEM IN THAT LANGUAGE MY GOOD FRIENDS SAID I
731-366-0056 WILL YOU BE SO KIND AS TO TELL ME THE NAME OF THIS TOWN AND INFORM ME WHERE I AM YOU WILL KNOW THAT SOON ENOUGH REPLIED A MAN WITH A HOARSE VOICE
731-366-0057 I WAS EXCEEDINGLY SURPRISED ON RECEIVING SO RUDE AN ANSWER FROM A STRANGER
731-366-0058 WHY DO YOU ANSWER ME SO ROUGHLY I REPLIED SURELY IT IS NOT THE CUSTOM OF ENGLISHMEN TO RECEIVE STRANGERS SO INHOSPITABLY I DO NOT KNOW SAID THE MAN
731-366-0059 WHILE THIS STRANGE DIALOGUE CONTINUED I PERCEIVED THE CROWD RAPIDLY INCREASE THEIR FACES EXPRESSED A MIXTURE OF CURIOSITY AND ANGER WHICH ANNOYED AND IN SOME DEGREE ALARMED ME
731-366-0060 I INQUIRED THE WAY TO THE INN BUT NO ONE REPLIED I THEN MOVED FORWARD AND A MURMURING SOUND AROSE FROM THE CROWD AS THEY FOLLOWED AND SURROUNDED ME WHEN AN ILL LOOKING MAN APPROACHING
731-366-0061 TAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER AND SAID COME SIR YOU MUST FOLLOW ME TO MISTER KIRWIN'S TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF YOURSELF WHO IS MISTER KIRWIN WHY AM I TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF MYSELF
731-366-0062 AY SIR FREE ENOUGH FOR HONEST FOLKS MISTER KIRWIN IS A MAGISTRATE AND YOU ARE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE DEATH OF A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS FOUND MURDERED HERE LAST NIGHT THIS ANSWER STARTLED ME
731-366-0063 BUT I PRESENTLY RECOVERED MYSELF I WAS INNOCENT THAT COULD EASILY BE PROVED ACCORDINGLY I FOLLOWED MY CONDUCTOR IN SILENCE AND WAS LED TO ONE OF THE BEST HOUSES IN THE TOWN
731-366-0064 LITTLE DID I THEN EXPECT THE CALAMITY THAT WAS IN A FEW MOMENTS TO OVERWHELM ME AND EXTINGUISH IN HORROR AND DESPAIR ALL FEAR OF IGNOMINY OR DEATH
