23-124439-0086 SO THAT I MIGHT FAIRLY HAVE SAID THAT THE WOUND WHICH POOR LUCY LEFT ON ME WAS BECOMING CICATRISED EVERYTHING IS HOWEVER NOW REOPENED AND WHAT IS TO BE THE END GOD ONLY KNOWS
23-124439-0087 I HAVE AN IDEA THAT VAN HELSING THINKS HE KNOWS TOO BUT HE WILL ONLY LET OUT ENOUGH AT A TIME TO WHET CURIOSITY HE WENT TO EXETER YESTERDAY AND STAYED THERE ALL NIGHT TO DAY HE CAME BACK AND ALMOST BOUNDED INTO THE ROOM AT ABOUT HALF PAST FIVE O'CLOCK
23-124439-0088 AND THRUST LAST NIGHT'S WESTMINSTER GAZETTE INTO MY HAND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT HE ASKED AS HE STOOD BACK AND FOLDED HIS ARMS I LOOKED OVER THE PAPER FOR I REALLY DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE MEANT
23-124439-0089 BUT HE TOOK IT FROM ME AND POINTED OUT A PARAGRAPH ABOUT CHILDREN BEING DECOYED AWAY AT HAMPSTEAD IT DID NOT CONVEY MUCH TO ME UNTIL I REACHED A PASSAGE WHERE IT DESCRIBED SMALL PUNCTURED WOUNDS ON THEIR THROATS AN IDEA STRUCK ME AND I LOOKED UP
23-124439-0090 WELL HE SAID IT IS LIKE POOR LUCY'S AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT SIMPLY THAT THERE IS SOME CAUSE IN COMMON WHATEVER IT WAS THAT INJURED HER HAS INJURED THEM I DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND HIS ANSWER

23-124439-0093 AS TO WHAT POOR LUCY DIED OF NOT AFTER ALL THE HINTS GIVEN NOT ONLY BY EVENTS BUT BY ME OF NERVOUS PROSTRATION FOLLOWING ON GREAT LOSS OR WASTE OF BLOOD
23-124439-0094 OR THINK THEY KNOW SOME THINGS WHICH OTHER MEN HAVE TOLD THEM AH IT IS THE FAULT OF OUR SCIENCE THAT IT WANTS TO EXPLAIN ALL AND IF IT EXPLAIN NOT THEN IT SAYS THERE IS NOTHING TO EXPLAIN
23-124439-0095 I SUPPOSE NOW YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN CORPOREAL TRANSFERENCE NO NOR IN MATERIALISATION NO NOR IN ASTRAL BODIES NO

23-124439-0097 AND REJECT THE THOUGHT READING LET ME TELL YOU MY FRIEND THAT THERE ARE THINGS DONE TO DAY IN ELECTRICAL SCIENCE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN DEEMED UNHOLY BY THE VERY MEN WHO DISCOVERED ELECTRICITY
23-124439-0098 AS WIZARDS THERE ARE ALWAYS MYSTERIES IN LIFE
23-124439-0099 CAN YOU TELL ME WHY WHEN OTHER SPIDERS DIE SMALL AND SOON THAT ONE GREAT SPIDER LIVED FOR CENTURIES IN THE TOWER OF THE OLD SPANISH CHURCH AND GREW AND GREW
23-124439-0100 TILL ON DESCENDING HE COULD DRINK THE OIL OF ALL THE CHURCH LAMPS CAN YOU TELL ME WHY IN THE PAMPAS AY AND ELSEWHERE
23-124439-0101 HOW IN SOME ISLANDS OF THE WESTERN SEAS THERE ARE BATS WHICH HANG ON THE TREES ALL DAY AND THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN DESCRIBE AS LIKE GIANT NUTS OR PODS AND THAT WHEN THE SAILORS SLEEP ON THE DECK BECAUSE THAT IT IS HOT FLIT DOWN ON THEM AND THEN
23-124439-0102 AND THAT SUCH A THING IS HERE IN LONDON IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HE WAVED HIS HAND FOR SILENCE AND WENT ON
23-124439-0103 AND CORN SOWED ON IT AND THE CORN REAPED AND BE CUT AND SOWN AND REAPED AND CUT AGAIN AND THEN MEN COME AND TAKE AWAY THE UNBROKEN SEAL AND THAT THERE LIE THE INDIAN FAKIR NOT DEAD BUT THAT RISE UP AND WALK AMONGST THEM AS BEFORE
23-124439-0104 HERE I INTERRUPTED HIM I WAS GETTING BEWILDERED HE SO CROWDED ON MY MIND HIS LIST OF NATURE'S ECCENTRICITIES AND POSSIBLE IMPOSSIBILITIES THAT MY IMAGINATION WAS GETTING FIRED
23-124439-0105 I HAD A DIM IDEA THAT HE WAS TEACHING ME SOME LESSON AS LONG AGO HE USED TO DO IN HIS STUDY AT AMSTERDAM
23-124439-0106 I FEEL LIKE A NOVICE LUMBERING THROUGH A BOG IN A MIST JUMPING FROM ONE TUSSOCK TO ANOTHER IN THE MERE BLIND EFFORT TO MOVE ON WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE I AM GOING
23-124439-0107 WELL I SHALL TELL YOU MY THESIS IS THIS I WANT YOU TO BELIEVE TO BELIEVE WHAT TO BELIEVE IN THINGS THAT YOU CANNOT
23-124439-0108 LET ME ILLUSTRATE I HEARD ONCE OF AN AMERICAN WHO SO DEFINED FAITH THAT FACULTY WHICH ENABLES US TO BELIEVE THINGS WHICH WE KNOW TO BE UNTRUE FOR ONE I FOLLOW THAT MAN
23-124439-0109 HE MEANT THAT WE SHALL HAVE AN OPEN MIND AND NOT LET A LITTLE BIT OF TRUTH CHECK THE RUSH OF A BIG TRUTH LIKE A SMALL ROCK DOES A RAILWAY TRUCK WE GET THE SMALL TRUTH FIRST GOOD
23-124439-0110 WE KEEP HIM AND WE VALUE HIM BUT ALL THE SAME WE MUST NOT LET HIM THINK HIMSELF ALL THE TRUTH IN THE UNIVERSE THEN YOU WANT ME NOT TO LET SOME PREVIOUS CONVICTION
23-124439-0111 DO I READ YOUR LESSON ARIGHT AH YOU ARE MY FAVOURITE PUPIL STILL IT IS WORTH TO TEACH YOU NOW THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE TAKEN THE FIRST STEP TO UNDERSTAND
23-124439-0112 I SUPPOSE SO HE STOOD UP AND SAID SOLEMNLY THEN YOU ARE WRONG OH WOULD IT WERE SO BUT ALAS NO IT IS WORSE FAR FAR WORSE
23-124439-0113 WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CRIED HE THREW HIMSELF WITH A DESPAIRING GESTURE INTO A CHAIR AND PLACED HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE COVERING HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS AS HE SPOKE
