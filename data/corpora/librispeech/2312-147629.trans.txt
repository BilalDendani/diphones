2312-147629-0000 TWARDOWSKI THE POLISH FAUST TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THERE WAS POINTED OUT TO VISITORS IN THE OLD TOWN OF KRAKAU THE HOUSE OF THE MAGICIAN TWARDOWSKI WHO QUITE PROPERLY WAS CALLED
2312-147629-0001 THE FAUST OF POLAND BECAUSE OF HIS DEALINGS WITH THE EVIL ONE IN HIS YOUTH TWARDOWSKI HAD FOLLOWED THE STUDY OF MEDICINE
2312-147629-0002 THAT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE WAS THE MOST CELEBRATED DOCTOR IN ALL POLAND BUT TWARDOWSKI WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS HE CRAVED GREATER AND STILL GREATER POWER AT LAST ONE DAY AS HE WAS READING
2312-147629-0003 HE FOUND IN AN OLD BOOK OF MAGIC THAT FOR WHICH HE HAD LONG BEEN SEEKING THE FORMULA FOR SUMMONING THE DEVIL WHEN NIGHT CAME A STORM HAD RISEN BUT CARING NOT FOR THAT HE HURRIED AWAY TO THE LONELY MOUNTAIN KREMENKI
2312-147629-0004 THERE IN A RUDELY CONSTRUCTED HUT HE BEGAN HIS INCANTATIONS BEFORE LONG THERE WAS AN EARTHQUAKE GREAT ROCKS WERE LOOSENED THE GROUND OPENED AT TWARDOWSKI'S FEET AND FLAMES LEAPED OUT
2312-147629-0005 AND IN THE FLAMES APPEARED THE EVIL ONE HIMSELF IN THE FORM OF A MAN
2312-147629-0006 WHAT DO YOU WISH THE DEVIL ASKED THE POWER OF YOUR MOST SECRET WISDOM WAS THE ANSWER AND HOW IS THIS TO BE DONE
2312-147629-0007 AND SHALL BESIDES GIVE ME SUCH HAPPINESS AS NO MAN HAS EVER ENJOYED UPON THIS EARTH BEFORE SO BE IT SAID THE DEVIL BUT ON CONDITION THAT AT THE END OF SEVEN YEARS I GAIN POSSESSION OF YOUR SOUL
2312-147629-0008 BUT ONLY IN ROME MAY YOU HAVE POWER OVER ME THITHER AT THE END OF SEVEN YEARS WILL I GO THE DEVIL HESITATED OVER THIS CLAUSE BUT THINKING OF THE FUN HE COULD HAVE IN THE HOLY CITY FINALLY AGREED
2312-147629-0009 LEANING AGAINST THE WALL OF STONE HE WROTE THE COMPACT WHICH TWARDOWSKI MAKING A SLIGHT WOUND IN HIS ARM SIGNED WITH HIS OWN BLOOD WHEN TWARDOWSKI DESCENDED FROM THE MOUNTAIN AND MADE HIS WAY
2312-147629-0010 BOOK UNDER ARM THROUGH THE VALLEY HE HEARD THE BELLS IN ALL THE TOWERS OF THE CITY RINGING OUT CLEARLY AND SOLEMNLY ON THE STILL NIGHT AIR HE LISTENED WONDERING AT THE UNACCUSTOMED NOISE THEN
2312-147629-0011 HURRIED INTO THE TOWN INQUIRING FROM EVERY ONE HE MET WHAT THE OCCASION WAS BUT NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE HEARD THE SOUND THEN A DEEP FEELING OF SADNESS CAME OVER HIM AS HE REALIZED THE MEANING OF THE BELLS
2312-147629-0012 THEY WERE THE FUNERAL KNELL OF HIS OWN SOUL WHEN MORNING CAME HOWEVER DOUBTS WERE FORGOTTEN AND TWARDOWSKI WAS GLAD TO HAVE THE DEVIL AT HIS COMMAND
2312-147629-0013 THE FIRST THING THAT HE DEMANDED WAS TO HAVE ALL THE SILVER OF POLAND GATHERED TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE AND COVERED OVER WITH GREAT MOUNDS OF SAND SIMILAR REQUESTS FOLLOWED AND IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE DEVIL REPENTED OF HIS BARGAIN
2312-147629-0014 ONE DAY IT WOULD PLEASE TWARDOWSKI TO FLY WITHOUT WINGS THROUGH THE AIR ON ANOTHER TO THE DELIGHT OF THE CROWD TO GALLOP BACKWARD ON A COCK ON ANOTHER TO FLOAT IN A BOAT WITHOUT A RUDDER OR SAIL ACCOMPANIED BY SOME MAIDEN
2312-147629-0015 WHO FOR THE MOMENT HAD INFLAMED HIS HEART ONE DAY BY THE USE OF HIS MAGIC MIRROR HE SET FIRE TO THE CASTLE OF AN ENEMY A MILE AWAY THIS LAST FEAT MADE HIM GREATLY FEARED BY PEOPLE FAR AND WIDE
2312-147629-0016 AT LAST THE SEVEN YEARS WERE UP THE DEVIL APPEARED TO TWARDOWSKI AND SAID TWARDOWSKI THE TIME OF OUR PACT IS OVER AND I COMMAND YOU TO FULFILL YOUR PROMISE AND GO TO ROME WHAT SHALL I DO THERE
2312-147629-0017 GIVE ME YOUR IMMORTAL SOUL WAS THE ANSWER DO YOU THINK I AM A FOOL ASKED TWARDOWSKI YOU GAVE ME YOUR PROMISE TO GO TO ROME AFTER SEVEN YEARS THAT I HAVE ALREADY DONE SAID TWARDOWSKI
2312-147629-0018 AND I DID NOT PROMISE TO STAY IN ROME NOBLE DECEIVER EXCLAIMED THE EVIL ONE STUPID DEVIL CRIED TWARDOWSKI THEN AFTER A STRUGGLE THE DEVIL VANISHED
2312-147629-0019 AND TWARDOWSKI RETURNED HOME FOR OVER A YEAR HE PORED INCESSANTLY OVER HIS BOOKS OF MAGIC UNTIL AT LAST HE FOUND A FORMULA FOR WARDING OFF DEATH
2312-147629-0020 AND EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS GOING TO TEST THE FORMULA YOU HAVE ALWAYS OBLIGED ME WITHOUT QUESTION SAID TWARDOWSKI AND I EXPECT YOU TO NOW TAKE THIS KNIFE AND THRUST IT INTO MY HEART
2312-147629-0021 WHY ARE YOU FRIGHTENED I KNOW WHAT I AM DOING TAKE THE KNIFE AND KILL ME AS THE PARCHMENT DIRECTS I CANNOT YOU MUST INSISTED TWARDOWSKI IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
2312-147629-0022 NO MORE EXCLAMATIONS DO AS I TELL YOU
2312-147629-0023 STRIKE THUNDERED TWARDOWSKI OR I WILL KILL YOU THIS INSTANT THEN FAMULUS DID AS HE WAS BID AND FORCED THE BLADE INTO HIS MASTER'S HEART TWARDOWSKI UTTERED A LOW CRY
2312-147629-0024 FELL AND WAS SOON DEAD
2312-147629-0025 WHAT HE MUST DO TO RESTORE THE BODY TO LIFE THEN HE SET ABOUT THE TASK SEVERED THE LIMBS OF THE DEAD BODY AND WORKED AND BREWED AND DISTILLED UNTIL THE ELIXIR DESCRIBED IN THE PARCHMENT WAS PREPARED
2312-147629-0026 WITH THE ELIXIR HE RUBBED THE MEMBERS OF THE MASTER'S BODY PUT THEM TOGETHER AND LAID THE CORPSE IN A COFFIN THIS HE BURIED ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT EXPLAINING TO TWARDOWSKI'S FRIENDS
2312-147629-0027 THAT SUCH HAD BEEN THE MASTER'S WISH NOW THE PARCHMENT STATED THAT THE BODY MUST REMAIN IN THE GRAVE SEVEN YEARS SEVEN MONTHS SEVEN DAYS AND SEVEN HOURS
2312-147629-0028 AT LAST THE TIME HAD EXPIRED AND ON A SNOWY COLD DECEMBER NIGHT HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE GRAVE HE DUG OUT THE COFFIN BRUSHED OFF THE SNOW AND EARTH OPENED THE CASKET
2312-147629-0029 AND FOUND NOT THE BODY OF TWARDOWSKI BUT THAT OF A CHILD WHO LAY SLEEPING IN A BED OF FRAGRANT VIOLETS THE CHILD IS LIKE TWARDOWSKI
2312-147629-0030 UNDER HIS CLOAK AND CARRIED HIM HOME THE NEXT MORNING THE CHILD WAS THE SIZE OF A TWELVE YEAR OLD AND AFTER SEVEN WEEKS HE WAS A FULL GROWN MAN TWARDOWSKI WHO NOW SEEMED QUITE HIMSELF
2312-147629-0031 ONLY YOUNGER AND STRONGER THANKED FAMULUS AND RESUMED AGAIN HIS STUDY OF MAGIC HE DESIRED ABOVE ALL THINGS TO BE FREED FOREVER FROM HIS COMPACT WITH THE DEVIL THIS HE READ IN ONE OF THE BOOKS
2312-147629-0032 HE MIGHT DO IF HE WOULD BRAVE THE TERRORS OF THE UNDERWORLD SO TWARDOWSKI DETERMINED TO ENTER THE GATES OF HELL AT HIS MAGIC SPEECH THE GROUND OPENED AND HE BEGAN THE PATH OF DESCENT
2312-147629-0033 BLUE FLAMES LIGHTED THE WAY DEEPER AND DEEPER HE WENT THROUGH DARK AND WINDING PASSAGES AT LAST HE REACHED THE UNDERWORLD ITSELF AND MANY AWFUL SIGHTS DID HE BEHOLD
2312-147629-0034 AND THE FARTHER HE WENT THE MORE FRIGHTENED DID HE BECOME HE COULD NOT HELP FEELING THAT THE DEVIL HAD PLOTTED SOMETHING AGAINST HIM FINALLY HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A SMALL ROOM AND CAST A HASTY GLANCE AROUND
2312-147629-0035 LOOKING FOR A MEANS OF ESCAPE SEEING A CHILD IN A CRADLE IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM HE SEIZED IT HASTILY THREW HIS CLOAK AROUND IT AND WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND THE EVIL ONE ENTERED
2312-147629-0036 HE MADE A RESPECTFUL BOW AND SAID WILL YOU BE GOOD ENOUGH TO GO WITH ME NOW WHY SO ASKED TWARDOWSKI OBSTINATELY BECAUSE OF OUR AGREEMENT BUT SAID THE MAGICIAN
2312-147629-0037 ONLY IN ROME HAVE YOU POWER OVER ME YES REPLIED THE DEVIL AND ROME IS THE NAME OF THIS HOUSE YOU THINK TO TRICK ME BY A PUN BUT YOU CANNOT
2312-147629-0038 I CARRY THIS TALISMAN OF INNOCENCE AND THROWING ASIDE HIS CLOAK HE DISCLOSED THE SLEEPING CHILD ANGER SHOWED IN THE FACE OF THE DEVIL BUT HE STEPPED NEARER TO TWARDOWSKI AND SAID SOFTLY
2312-147629-0039 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF TWARDOWSKI HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN YOUR PROMISE
2312-147629-0040 PRIDE AWOKE IN THE BREAST OF THE MAGICIAN I MUST KEEP MY WORD HE SAID
2312-147629-0041 THE MAGICIAN WAS SO TERRIFIED AND SUFFERED SUCH ANGUISH IN THE CLUTCHES OF THE EVIL ONE THAT IN A FEW MOMENTS HE WAS CHANGED INTO AN OLD MAN BUT HE DID NOT LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS AT LAST SO HIGH WERE THEY
2312-147629-0042 THAT CITIES APPEARED LIKE FLIES AND KRAKAU WITH ITS MIGHTY TURRETS LIKE TWO SPIDERS DEEPLY MOVED TWARDOWSKI LOOKED DOWN UPON THE SCENE OF ALL HIS STRUGGLES AND ALL HIS JOYS
2312-147629-0043 BUT HIGHER AND HIGHER THEY WENT HIGHER THAN ANY EAGLE HAS EVER FLOWN AND MORE LONELY AND MORE FEARFUL DID IT SEEM TO TWARDOWSKI ONLY OCCASIONALLY BRIGHT STARS PASSED BY THEM OR FIERY METEORS
2312-147629-0044 LEAVING A LONG STREAK OF LIGHT BEHIND AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE MOON WHICH STARED AT THEM WITH DEAD EYES THEN A SONG THAT TWARDOWSKI HAD READ IN HIS MOTHER'S HYMN BOOK ROSE TO HIS LIPS
2312-147629-0045 AND AS HE REPEATED MECHANICALLY THE PRAYER HIS MOTHER HAD TAUGHT HIM AN ANGEL SUDDENLY APPEARED AND SAID SATAN LET TWARDOWSKI GO AND YOU TWARDOWSKI HANG YOU THERE BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH
2312-147629-0046 TO ATONE FOR YOUR SIN UNTIL THE LAST JUDGMENT THEN WILL YOU BE REUNITED WITH YOUR MOTHER IN HEAVEN THE PRAYER WHICH YOU REMEMBERED IN YOUR HOUR OF NEED HAS SAVED YOU AND SO
