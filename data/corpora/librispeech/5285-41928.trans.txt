5285-41928-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME ALL THE STREAMS AND RIVERS RAN SO DRY THAT THE ANIMALS DID NOT KNOW HOW TO GET WATER AFTER A VERY LONG SEARCH WHICH HAD BEEN QUITE IN VAIN THEY FOUND A TINY SPRING
5285-41928-0001 WHICH ONLY WANTED TO BE DUG DEEPER SO AS TO YIELD PLENTY OF WATER SO THE BEASTS SAID TO EACH OTHER LET US DIG A WELL AND THEN WE SHALL NOT FEAR TO DIE OF THIRST AND THEY ALL CONSENTED EXCEPT THE JACKAL WHO HATED WORK OF ANY KIND
5285-41928-0002 AND GENERALLY GOT SOMEBODY TO DO IT FOR HIM WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED THEIR WELL THEY HELD A COUNCIL AS TO WHO SHOULD BE MADE THE GUARDIAN OF THE WELL SO THAT THE JACKAL MIGHT NOT COME NEAR IT FOR THEY SAID HE WOULD NOT WORK THEREFORE HE SHALL NOT DRINK
5285-41928-0003 AFTER SOME TALK IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE RABBIT SHOULD BE LEFT IN CHARGE THEN ALL THE OTHER BEASTS WENT BACK TO THEIR HOMES
5285-41928-0004 AND THE RABBIT POLITELY SAID GOOD MORNING THEN THE JACKAL UNFASTENED THE LITTLE BAG THAT HUNG AT HIS SIDE AND PULLED OUT OF IT A PIECE OF HONEYCOMB WHICH HE BEGAN TO EAT AND TURNING TO THE RABBIT HE REMARKED AS YOU SEE RABBIT
5285-41928-0005 AND THIS IS NICER THAN ANY WATER GIVE ME A BIT ASKED THE RABBIT SO THE JACKAL HANDED HIM A VERY LITTLE MORSEL OH HOW GOOD IT IS CRIED THE RABBIT GIVE ME A LITTLE MORE DEAR FRIEND
5285-41928-0006 BUT THE JACKAL ANSWERED IF YOU REALLY WANT ME TO GIVE YOU SOME MORE YOU MUST HAVE YOUR PAWS TIED BEHIND YOU AND LIE ON YOUR BACK
5285-41928-0007 THE RABBIT DID AS HE WAS BID AND WHEN HE WAS TIED TIGHT AND POPPED ON HIS BACK THE JACKAL RAN TO THE SPRING AND DRANK AS MUCH AS HE WANTED
5285-41928-0008 IN THE EVENING THE ANIMALS ALL CAME BACK AND WHEN THEY SAW THE RABBIT LYING WITH HIS PAWS TIED THEY SAID TO HIM RABBIT HOW DID YOU LET YOURSELF BE TAKEN IN LIKE THIS
5285-41928-0009 RABBIT YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN AN IDIOT TO HAVE LET THE JACKAL DRINK OUR WATER WHEN HE WOULD NOT HELP TO FIND IT WHO SHALL BE OUR NEXT WATCHMAN WE MUST HAVE SOMEBODY A LITTLE SHARPER THAN YOU AND THE LITTLE HARE CALLED OUT
5285-41928-0010 THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE ANIMALS ALL WENT THEIR VARIOUS WAYS LEAVING THE LITTLE HARE TO GUARD THE SPRING WHEN THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT THE JACKAL CAME BACK GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING LITTLE HARE
5285-41928-0011 I AM SO SORRY BUT I HAVE NONE ANSWERED THE LITTLE HARE
5285-41928-0012 PULLING OUT OF IT A PIECE OF HONEYCOMB HE LICKED HIS LIPS AND EXCLAIMED OH LITTLE HARE
5285-41928-0013 WHAT IS IT ASKED THE LITTLE HARE IT IS SOMETHING THAT MOISTENS MY THROAT SO DELICIOUSLY ANSWERED THE JACKAL THAT AFTER I HAVE EATEN IT I DON'T FEEL THIRSTY ANY MORE WHILE I AM SURE THAT ALL YOU OTHER BEASTS ARE FOR EVER WANTING WATER
5285-41928-0014 GIVE ME A BIT DEAR FRIEND
5285-41928-0015 NOT SO FAST REPLIED THE JACKAL IF YOU REALLY WISH TO ENJOY WHAT YOU ARE EATING YOU MUST HAVE YOUR PAWS TIED BEHIND YOU
