8321-260942-0000 THOUGH SHE HAD SLEPT LATE IN FACT TILL NOON AND SOMETHING AFTER
8321-260942-0001 SHE COULD NOT REMEMBER HOW OR WHY
8321-260942-0002 WITHOUT RELISH FOR THE PROMISE OF THE DAY IN A MOOD ALTOGETHER AS DREAR AS THE DAYLIGHT THAT WAITED UPON HER UNCLOSING EYES MAIN STRENGTH OF WILL HAD NOT AVAILED TO DISPEL THESE VAPOURS
8321-260942-0003 NEITHER DID THEIR MELANCHOLY YIELD TO THE DISTRACTION PROVIDED BY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH WAYS OF A WORLD
8321-260942-0004 AND AT ANY OTHER TIME IN ANY OTHER TEMPER SHE KNEW SHE MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT OFF HER FEET BY ITS EXCITING APPEAL TO HER INNATE LOVE OF LUXURY AND SENSATION BUT THE SAD TRUTH WAS
8321-260942-0005 ACCORDING TO AGE SEX AND TEMPORAL STATE OF SERVITUDE DID NOTHING TO MITIGATE THE HARSHNESS OF THOSE FIRST IMPRESSIONS IF ANYTHING HER DEPRESSION GREW MORE PERVERSELY MORBID THE MORE SHE WAS CATERED TO COURTED FLATTERED AND CAJOLED SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED SHE COULD NEVER GUESS WHAT
8321-260942-0006 TO TURN HER VIVID ZEST IN LIFE TO ASHES IN HER MOUTH SO THAT NOTHING SEEMED TO MATTER ANY MORE THOUGHTS OF KARSLAKE AS HER LOVER
8321-260942-0007 PRECIOUS BEYOND COMPARE FOUND HER INDIFFERENT TO DAY AND LEFT HER SO TRY AS SHE WOULD SHE FAILED TO RECAPTURE ANY SENSE OF THE REALITY OF THOSE FIRST RAPTURES AND YET SOMEHOW SHE DIDN'T DOUBT HE LOVED HER OR THAT BURIED DEEP BENEATH THIS INEXPLICABLE APATHY
8321-260942-0008 LOVE FOR KARSLAKE BURNED ON IN HER HEART BUT SHE KNEW NO SORT OF COMFORT IN SUCH CONFIDENCE
8321-260942-0009 NOTHING MATTERED SHE WAS ABLE EVEN TO MEET PRINCE VICTOR WITHOUT HER CUSTOMARY SHIVER OF AVERSION AND WHEN SHE RECALLED THE PERSISTENCE AND ENTHUSIASM WITH WHICH SHE HAD REASONED HERSELF INTO BELIEVING LAST NIGHT THAT HE MIGHT BE ANOTHER THAN HER FATHER
8321-260942-0010 SHE CAME AS NEAR TO MIRTH AS SHE WAS TO COME THAT DAY BUT IT WAS MIRTH BITTER WITH SELF DERISION OF COURSE HE WAS HER FATHER SHE HAD BEEN A NINNY EVER TO DREAM CONTRARIWISE OR THAT IT MATTERED
8321-260942-0011 NOR HAD SHE MET WITH MORE SUCCESS IN EFFORTS TO FIND A CAUSE FOR THIS DRAB HUMOUR UNLESS INDEED IT WERE SIMPLY THE FARTHEST SWING OF THE PENDULUM FROM YESTERDAY'S EMOTIONAL CRISES A LONG SWING OUT OF SUNLIT SPACES SWEPT BY THE BRAVE WINDS OF YOUNG ROMANCE INTO A GLOOMY ZONE OF BROODING TORPOR
8321-260942-0012 SURCHARGED WITH UNSEIZABLE DISQUIET ITS ATMOSPHERE ELECTRICAL WITH FORMLESS APPREHENSIONS ITS SAD TWILIGHT SHOT WITH LURID GLEAMS NO SOONER GLIMPSED THAN GONE IN THIS STATE SOFIA'S SENSIBILITIES WERE LESS BENUMBED
8321-260942-0013 THAN BOUND IN A PALSY OF SUSPENSE NOT WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF DREAD BENEATH THE LETHARGIC SHALLOWS OF CONSCIOUSNESS LAY SOUNDLESS DEEPS TROUBLED BY SINISTER PREMONITIONS NOW
8321-260942-0014 WITH ITS KEEN WONDER THAT SHE HAD CONTRIVED TO SURVIVE SUCH EXQUISITE TEDIUM SHE PERCEIVED THAT SHE HAD MOVED THROUGHOUT LIKE AN AUTOMATON SWAYED BY A WILL OUTSIDE ITS OWN FUNCTIONING RATHER THAN LIVING PERFORMING APPOINTED BUSINESS EXECUTING PRESCRIBED GESTURES
8321-260942-0015 UTTERING FOREORDAINED OBSERVATIONS AND MAKING DICTATED RESPONSES ALL WITHOUT SUGGESTION OF SPONTANEITY
8321-260942-0016 WAITING FOR WHAT SOFIA COULD NOT GUESS SHE WENT TO BED PRESENTLY HOPING ONLY TO FIND SURCEASE OF BOREDOM
8321-260942-0017 DISCREET AND WELL INSTRUCTED CHOU NU TURNED THE NIGHT LIGHT DOWN TO A GLIMMER PLACED ON AND UNDER A CHAIR ADJACENT TO THE BED A ROBE OF CASHMERE THAT WOULDN'T RUSTLE AND SLIPPERS OF FINE FELT WITH SOLES OF SOFT LEATHER
8321-260942-0018 IN WHICH FOOTFALLS MUST BE INAUDIBLE AND GLIDED GENTLY FROM THE ROOM
8321-260942-0019 SHE RESTED WITHOUT TOSSING WITHOUT MOVING A FINGER THEN SLEEP HAVING HELD HER FOR PRECISELY ONE HOUR BY THE CLOCK SOFIA OPENED HER EYES
8321-260942-0020 THE MEMORY OF THAT HOUR WAS NOT TO LEAVE THE GIRL WHILE LIFE WAS IN HER NOR WAS THE QUESTION IT RAISED EVER TO BE ANSWERED IN A FASHION SATISFACTORY TO HER INTELLIGENCE WHEN LATER SHE HEARD IT STATED WITH AUTHORITY
8321-260942-0021 AND THE CRIME HE HAD WILLED HER TO COMMIT IN FINAL ANALYSIS NOT REPUGNANT TO HER INSTINCTS OR WAS IT SOME SECRET FACULTY OF THE SOUL TELEPATHY OR OF ITS KIN THAT ROUSED AND SENT HER TO KEEP HER RENDEZVOUS WITH DESTINY A RIDDLE NEVER TO BE READ
8321-260942-0022 SOFIA ONLY KNEW THAT FINDING HERSELF AWAKE SHE GOT UP DONNED NEGLIGEE AND SLIPPERS AND SET HER FEET UPON THE WAY APPOINTED WITHOUT ITS OCCURRING TO HER THAT THE WAY WAS STRANGE WITHOUT STOPPING TO QUESTION WHY OR WHETHER
8321-260942-0023 IT COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN APPARENT SOFIA HERSELF WAS NOT AWARE OF ITS SUSPENSE OR SUPERSESSION SHE KNEW QUITE WELL WHAT SHE WAS DOING HER EVERY ACTION WAS DIRECT AND DECIDED THE GOAL ALONE REMAINED OBSCURE
8321-260942-0024 SHE ONLY KNEW THAT SOMEWHERE SOMEHOW SOMETHING WAS GOING WRONG WITHOUT HER AND HER PRESENCE WAS REQUIRED TO SET IT RIGHT
8321-260942-0025 BUT LEFT IT UNLATCHED WITH WHAT OBJECT SHE DID NOT KNOW BUT THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR THE STILLNESS OF THE SLEEPING HOUSEHOLD MADE IT SEEM QUITE IN ORDER THAT SHE SHOULD PAUSE TO LOOK CAUTIOUSLY THIS WAY AND THAT
8321-260942-0026 THE PURPOSE OF THIS AS YET AIMLESS NOCTURNAL FLITTING THERE WAS NOBODY THAT SHE COULD SEE
8321-260942-0027 WHEN CHANCE OR FATE OR THE SMOOTH WORKING OUT OF MALICIOUS MORTAL MACHINATIONS
8321-260942-0028 AND IN THE BOUDOIR SOFIA HAD SPENT
8321-260942-0029 THE CIRCUMSTANCE SEEMED SINGULAR
8321-260942-0030 LADY RANDOLPH WEST HAD AIRILY INFORMED HER THAT SHE CONSIDERED INSURANCE TO THEIR APPRAISED VALUE PLUS A STOUT LOCK ON THE BOUDOIR DOOR BETTER THAN ANY STRONG BOX AS YET DEVISED BY THE INGENUITY OF MAN THERE'S THE SAFE THEY'RE KEPT IN OF COURSE THE LADY HAD DECLARED BUT MY DEAR
8321-260942-0031 I NEVER EVEN TROUBLE TO LOCK THE THING
8321-260942-0032 IMPULSE AT LEAST SHE CALLED IT THAT MOVED SOFIA TO APPROACH AND CAUTIOUSLY OPEN THE DOOR STILL WIDER UPON THE ANTIQUE WRITING DESK THAT HOUSED THE SAFE BURNED A SINGLE LAMP OF LOW CANDLE POWER A DOOR THAT LED TO THE ADJOINING BEDCHAMBER WAS TIGHTLY SHUT
8321-260942-0033 SOFIA'S MISTRUSTFUL EYES RECONNOITRED EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM AND RECKONED IT EMPTY AGAIN OBEDIENT TO UNDISPUTED IMPULSE SHE STEPPED INSIDE AND SHUT THE DOOR THE SPRING LATCH OF THE AMERICAN LOCK FOUND ITS SOCKET WITH A SOFT CLICK
8321-260942-0034 THEREAFTER SILENCE NO SOUND IN THE BOUDOIR NONE FROM THE ROOM BEYOND BUT TO SOFIA THE HURRIED BEATING OF HER HEART REVERBERATED ON THE STILLNESS LIKE THE ROLLING OF A DRUM WITHOUT CLEAR APPRECIATION OF HOW SHE HAD GOT THERE
8321-260942-0035 SHE FOUND HERSELF STANDING OVER THE WRITING DESK AND DISCOVERED WHAT THE INDIFFERENT LIGHT HAD TILL NOW KEPT HIDDEN
8321-260942-0036 HER ACTIONS NOW MORE THAN EVER RESEMBLED THOSE OF AN UNTHINKING PUPPET
8321-260942-0037 SO TRUE WERE THEY TO THEATRICAL CONVENTION WITH FURTIVE FRIGHTENED GLANCES TOWARD BOTH DOORS SOFIA DROPPED TO HER KNEES BEFORE THE SAFE WHEN SHE STOOD UP AGAIN HER HANDS WERE FILLED WITH JEWELLERY HER TWO HANDS HELD A TREASURE OF INCALCULABLE PRICE IN PRECIOUS STONES
8321-260942-0038 SHE PAUSED FOR A LITTLE STARING AT THEM WITH DILATE EYES DARK IN A PALE RAPT FACE HER LIPS WERE PARTED BUT ONLY HER QUICKENED BREATHING WHISPERED PAST THEM SHE WAS TREMBLING MORE PAINFULLY THAN EVER BUT SHE SEEMED UNABLE TO THINK OF ANYTHING BUT THE JEWELS
8321-260942-0039 HERS FOR THE TAKING THEN WITHOUT WARNING A TREMENDOUS CONVULSION LAID HOLD ON HER BODY AND SOUL AND SHE WAS RACKED AND SHAKEN BY IT
