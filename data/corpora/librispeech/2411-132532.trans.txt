2411-132532-0000 FOR ROUSILLON WHICH HE HOPED TO REACH BEFORE NIGHT FALL
2411-132532-0001 THOUGH HE WAS THIS DAY ALSO FREQUENTLY OBLIGED TO ALIGHT
2411-132532-0002 AND TO CLIMB THE STEEP AND FLINTY MOUNTAIN THE WONDERFUL SUBLIMITY AND VARIETY OF THE PROSPECTS REPAID HIM FOR ALL THIS AND THE ENTHUSIASM WITH WHICH THEY WERE VIEWED BY HIS YOUNG COMPANIONS HEIGHTENED HIS OWN
2411-132532-0003 AND AWAKENED A REMEMBRANCE OF ALL THE DELIGHTFUL EMOTIONS OF HIS EARLY DAYS WHEN THE SUBLIME CHARMS OF NATURE WERE FIRST UNVEILED TO HIM HE FOUND GREAT PLEASURE IN CONVERSING WITH VALANCOURT AND IN LISTENING TO HIS INGENUOUS REMARKS
2411-132532-0004 THE FIRE AND SIMPLICITY OF HIS MANNERS SEEMED TO RENDER HIM A CHARACTERISTIC FIGURE IN THE SCENES AROUND THEM AND SAINT AUBERT DISCOVERED IN HIS SENTIMENTS THE JUSTNESS AND THE DIGNITY OF AN ELEVATED MIND UNBIASED BY INTERCOURSE WITH THE WORLD
2411-132532-0005 HE PERCEIVED THAT HIS OPINIONS WERE FORMED RATHER THAN IMBIBED WERE MORE THE RESULT OF THOUGHT THAN OF LEARNING OF THE WORLD HE SEEMED TO KNOW NOTHING FOR HE BELIEVED WELL OF ALL MANKIND AND THIS OPINION GAVE HIM THE REFLECTED IMAGE OF HIS OWN HEART
2411-132532-0006 SAINT AUBERT AS HE SOMETIMES LINGERED TO EXAMINE THE WILD PLANTS IN HIS PATH OFTEN LOOKED FORWARD WITH PLEASURE TO EMILY AND VALANCOURT AS THEY STROLLED ON TOGETHER HE WITH A COUNTENANCE OF ANIMATED DELIGHT
2411-132532-0007 POINTING TO HER ATTENTION SOME GRAND FEATURE OF THE SCENE AND SHE LISTENING AND OBSERVING WITH A LOOK OF TENDER SERIOUSNESS THAT SPOKE THE ELEVATION OF HER MIND THEY APPEARED LIKE TWO LOVERS WHO HAD NEVER STRAYED BEYOND THESE THEIR NATIVE MOUNTAINS
2411-132532-0008 WHOSE SITUATION HAD SECLUDED THEM FROM THE FRIVOLITIES OF COMMON LIFE WHOSE IDEAS WERE SIMPLE AND GRAND LIKE THE LANDSCAPES AMONG WHICH THEY MOVED AND WHO KNEW NO OTHER HAPPINESS THAN IN THE UNION OF PURE AND AFFECTIONATE HEARTS
2411-132532-0009 SAINT AUBERT SMILED AND SIGHED AT THE ROMANTIC PICTURE OF FELICITY HIS FANCY DREW
2411-132532-0010 DEPRAVE THE TASTE CORRUPT THE HEART AND LOVE CANNOT EXIST IN A HEART THAT HAS LOST THE MEEK DIGNITY OF INNOCENCE VIRTUE AND TASTE ARE NEARLY THE SAME FOR VIRTUE IS LITTLE MORE THAN ACTIVE TASTE
2411-132532-0011 WHERE SELFISHNESS DISSIPATION AND INSINCERITY SUPPLY THE PLACE OF TENDERNESS SIMPLICITY AND TRUTH IT WAS NEAR NOON WHEN THE TRAVELLERS HAVING ARRIVED AT A PIECE OF STEEP AND DANGEROUS ROAD ALIGHTED TO WALK
2411-132532-0012 THE ROAD WOUND UP AN ASCENT THAT WAS CLOTHED WITH WOOD AND INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE CARRIAGE THEY ENTERED THE REFRESHING SHADE A DEWY COOLNESS WAS DIFFUSED UPON THE AIR WHICH WITH THE BRIGHT VERDURE OF TURF THAT GREW UNDER THE TREES
2411-132532-0013 RENDERED THIS A MOST DELICIOUS RETREAT SOMETIMES THE THICK FOLIAGE EXCLUDED ALL VIEW OF THE COUNTRY AT OTHERS IT ADMITTED SOME PARTIAL CATCHES OF THE DISTANT SCENERY
2411-132532-0014 VALANCOURT OFTEN DROPPED SUDDENLY FROM THE MOST ANIMATING VIVACITY INTO FITS OF DEEP MUSING AND THERE WAS SOMETIMES AN UNAFFECTED MELANCHOLY IN HIS SMILE WHICH EMILY COULD NOT AVOID UNDERSTANDING FOR HER HEART WAS INTERESTED IN THE SENTIMENT IT SPOKE
2411-132532-0015 WHILE THE ROAD WOUND FAR AWAY OVER THE CLIFF ABOVE VALANCOURT CALLED LOUDLY TO MICHAEL BUT HEARD NO VOICE EXCEPT HIS OWN ECHOING AMONG THE ROCKS AND HIS VARIOUS EFFORTS TO REGAIN THE ROAD WERE EQUALLY UNSUCCESSFUL
2411-132532-0016 HE LOOKED INTO THE HUT BUT NO PERSON WAS THERE AND THE ELDEST OF THE BOYS TOLD HIM THAT THEIR FATHER WAS WITH HIS FLOCKS AND THEIR MOTHER WAS GONE DOWN INTO THE VALE BUT WOULD BE BACK PRESENTLY AS HE STOOD CONSIDERING WHAT WAS FURTHER TO BE DONE
2411-132532-0017 MEANWHILE
2411-132532-0018 FASTENED BETWEEN TWO PINES WHICH OVERSHADOWED IT TILL VALANCOURT WHOSE STEPS THEY HAD OBSERVED SHOULD RETURN THE ELDEST OF THE CHILDREN DESISTED FROM HIS PLAY AND STOOD STILL TO OBSERVE THE STRANGERS
2411-132532-0019 SAINT AUBERT LOOKED WITH PLEASURE UPON THIS PICTURE OF INFANTINE SIMPLICITY TILL IT BROUGHT TO HIS REMEMBRANCE HIS OWN BOYS WHOM HE HAD LOST ABOUT THE AGE OF THESE AND THEIR LAMENTED MOTHER AND HE SUNK INTO A THOUGHTFULNESS WHICH EMILY OBSERVING
2411-132532-0020 AND THEN TRIED TO DISSIPATE THE MELANCHOLY REFLECTIONS THAT LINGERED IN HIS MIND WHILE SHE SUNG VALANCOURT APPROACHED WHO WAS UNWILLING TO INTERRUPT HER AND PAUSED AT A LITTLE DISTANCE TO LISTEN WHEN SHE HAD CONCLUDED
2411-132532-0021 HE JOINED THE PARTY AND TOLD THEM THAT HE HAD FOUND MICHAEL AS WELL AS A WAY BY WHICH HE THOUGHT THEY COULD ASCEND THE CLIFF TO THE CARRIAGE HE POINTED TO THE WOODY STEEPS ABOVE WHICH SAINT AUBERT SURVEYED WITH AN ANXIOUS EYE HE WAS ALREADY WEARIED BY HIS WALK AND THIS ASCENT WAS FORMIDABLE TO HIM
2411-132532-0022 HE THOUGHT HOWEVER IT WOULD BE LESS TOILSOME THAN THE LONG AND BROKEN ROAD AND HE DETERMINED TO ATTEMPT IT BUT EMILY EVER WATCHFUL OF HIS EASE PROPOSING THAT HE SHOULD REST AND DINE BEFORE THEY PROCEEDED FURTHER
2411-132532-0023 WHEN THEY SAW A YOUNG WOMAN JOIN THE CHILDREN AND CARESS AND WEEP OVER THEM THE TRAVELLERS INTERESTED BY HER DISTRESS STOPPED TO OBSERVE HER SHE TOOK THE YOUNGEST OF THE CHILDREN IN HER ARMS AND PERCEIVING THE STRANGERS HASTILY DRIED HER TEARS AND PROCEEDED TO THE COTTAGE
2411-132532-0024 LEARNED THAT HER HUSBAND WHO WAS A SHEPHERD AND LIVED HERE IN THE SUMMER MONTHS TO WATCH OVER THE FLOCKS HE LED TO FEED UPON THESE MOUNTAINS HAD LOST ON THE PRECEDING NIGHT HIS LITTLE ALL A GANG OF GIPSIES WHO HAD FOR SOME TIME INFESTED THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
2411-132532-0025 HAD DRIVEN AWAY SEVERAL OF HIS MASTER'S SHEEP JACQUES ADDED THE SHEPHERD'S WIFE HAD SAVED A LITTLE MONEY AND HAD BOUGHT A FEW SHEEP WITH IT AND NOW THEY MUST GO TO HIS MASTER FOR THOSE THAT ARE STOLEN
2411-132532-0026 AND WHAT IS WORSE THAN ALL HIS MASTER WHEN HE COMES TO KNOW HOW IT IS WILL TRUST HIM NO LONGER WITH THE CARE OF HIS FLOCKS FOR HE IS A HARD MAN AND THEN WHAT IS TO BECOME OF OUR CHILDREN THE INNOCENT COUNTENANCE OF THE WOMAN
2411-132532-0027 AND VALANCOURT CONVINCED THAT IT WAS TRUE ASKED EAGERLY WHAT WAS THE VALUE OF THE STOLEN SHEEP ON HEARING WHICH HE TURNED AWAY WITH A LOOK OF DISAPPOINTMENT SAINT AUBERT PUT SOME MONEY INTO HER HAND EMILY TOO GAVE SOMETHING FROM HER LITTLE PURSE
2411-132532-0028 THAT IT WAS A SUM VERY LITTLE SHORT OF ALL HE HAD ABOUT HIM HE WAS PERPLEXED AND DISTRESSED THIS SUM THEN SAID HE TO HIMSELF WOULD MAKE THIS POOR FAMILY COMPLETELY HAPPY IT IS IN MY POWER TO GIVE IT TO MAKE THEM COMPLETELY HAPPY
2411-132532-0029 FOR A MOMENT HE STOOD UNWILLING TO FOREGO THE LUXURY OF RAISING A FAMILY FROM RUIN TO HAPPINESS YET CONSIDERING THE DIFFICULTIES OF PURSUING HIS JOURNEY WITH SO SMALL A SUM AS WOULD BE LEFT WHILE HE WAS IN THIS STATE OF PERPLEXITY
2411-132532-0030 THE SHEPHERD HIMSELF APPEARED HIS CHILDREN RAN TO MEET HIM
2411-132532-0031 HE THREW DOWN ALL THE MONEY HE HAD EXCEPT A VERY FEW LOUIS
2411-132532-0032 THEIR GREY TINTS WERE WELL CONTRASTED BY THE BRIGHT HUES OF THE PLANTS AND WILD FLOWERS THAT GREW IN THEIR FRACTURED SIDES AND WERE DEEPENED BY THE GLOOM OF THE PINES AND CEDARS THAT WAVED ABOVE THE STEEPS BELOW
2411-132532-0033 WITH ITS BLUEISH SMOKE CURLING HIGH IN THE AIR ON EVERY SIDE APPEARED THE MAJESTIC SUMMITS OF THE PYRENEES SOME EXHIBITING TREMENDOUS CRAGS OF MARBLE WHOSE APPEARANCE WAS CHANGING EVERY INSTANT AS THE VARYING LIGHTS FELL UPON THEIR SURFACE
2411-132532-0034 OTHERS STILL HIGHER DISPLAYING ONLY SNOWY POINTS WHILE THEIR LOWER STEEPS WERE COVERED ALMOST INVARIABLY WITH FORESTS OF PINE LARCH AND OAK THAT STRETCHED DOWN TO THE VALE
2411-132532-0035 THIS WAS ONE OF THE NARROW VALLIES THAT OPEN FROM THE PYRENEES INTO THE COUNTRY OF ROUSILLON AND WHOSE GREEN PASTURES AND CULTIVATED BEAUTY FORM A DECIDED AND WONDERFUL CONTRAST TO THE ROMANTIC GRANDEUR THAT ENVIRONS IT
2411-132532-0036 THROUGH A VISTA OF THE MOUNTAINS APPEARED THE LOWLANDS OF ROUSILLON TINTED WITH THE BLUE HAZE OF DISTANCE AS THEY UNITED WITH THE WATERS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN WHERE ON A PROMONTORY WHICH MARKED THE BOUNDARY OF THE SHORE STOOD A LONELY BEACON
2411-132532-0037 OVER WHICH WERE SEEN CIRCLING FLIGHTS OF SEA FOWL BEYOND APPEARED NOW AND THEN A STEALING SAIL WHITE WITH THE SUN BEAM AND WHOSE PROGRESS WAS PERCEIVABLE BY ITS APPROACH TO THE LIGHT HOUSE
2411-132532-0038 IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE TO THE SPOT WHERE THE TRAVELLERS RESTED A ROCKY PASS OPENED TOWARD GASCONY HERE NO SIGN OF CULTIVATION APPEARED THE ROCKS OF GRANITE THAT SCREENED THE GLEN ROSE ABRUPTLY FROM THEIR BASE AND STRETCHED THEIR BARREN POINTS TO THE CLOUDS
2411-132532-0039 THIS SPOT SEEMED THE VERY HAUNT OF BANDITTI AND EMILY AS SHE LOOKED DOWN UPON IT ALMOST EXPECTED TO SEE THEM STEALING OUT FROM SOME HOLLOW CAVE TO LOOK FOR THEIR PREY SOON AFTER AN OBJECT NOT LESS TERRIFIC STRUCK HER A GIBBET
2411-132532-0040 STANDING ON A POINT OF ROCK NEAR THE ENTRANCE OF THE PASS AND IMMEDIATELY OVER ONE OF THE CROSSES SHE HAD BEFORE OBSERVED THESE WERE HIEROGLYPHICS THAT TOLD A PLAIN AND DREADFUL STORY
2411-132532-0041 THAT THEY MIGHT WITH CERTAINTY REACH ROUSILLON BEFORE NIGHT FALL IT WAS NECESSARY HOWEVER THAT SAINT AUBERT SHOULD TAKE SOME REFRESHMENT AND SEATING THEMSELVES ON THE SHORT DRY TURF THEY OPENED THE BASKET OF PROVISIONS WHILE
2411-132532-0042 BY BREEZY MURMURS COOL'D BROAD O'ER THEIR HEADS THE VERDANT CEDARS WAVE AND HIGH PALMETOS LIFT THEIR GRACEFUL SHADE THEY DRAW ETHEREAL SOUL
2411-132532-0043 THERE DRINK REVIVING GALES PROFUSELY BREATHING FROM THE PINEY GROVES AND VALES OF FRAGRANCE THERE AT A DISTANCE HEAR THE ROARING FLOODS AND CATARACTS THOMSON
2411-132532-0044 THAT HE SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN HE HAD ANY FURTHER TO GO HAVING CONCLUDED THEIR SIMPLE REPAST THEY GAVE A LONG FAREWELL LOOK TO THE SCENE AND AGAIN BEGAN TO ASCEND SAINT AUBERT REJOICED WHEN HE REACHED THE CARRIAGE WHICH EMILY ENTERED WITH HIM
2411-132532-0045 BUT VALANCOURT WILLING TO TAKE A MORE EXTENSIVE VIEW OF THE ENCHANTING COUNTRY INTO WHICH THEY WERE ABOUT TO DESCEND THAN HE COULD DO FROM A CARRIAGE LOOSENED HIS DOGS AND ONCE MORE BOUNDED WITH THEM ALONG THE BANKS OF THE ROAD
2411-132532-0046 ALLOWED HIM TO OVERTAKE THEM WITH EASE WHENEVER A SCENE OF UNCOMMON MAGNIFICENCE APPEARED
2411-132532-0047 SOMETIMES MADE THE CHAISE WAIT WHILE EMILY WENT TO THE NEIGHBOURING CLIFF IT WAS EVENING WHEN THEY DESCENDED THE LOWER ALPS THAT BIND ROUSILLON AND FORM A MAJESTIC BARRIER ROUND THAT CHARMING COUNTRY LEAVING IT OPEN ONLY ON THE EAST TO THE MEDITERRANEAN
2411-132532-0048 THE GAY TINTS OF CULTIVATION ONCE MORE BEAUTIFIED THE LANDSCAPE FOR THE LOWLANDS WERE COLOURED WITH THE RICHEST HUES WHICH A LUXURIANT CLIMATE AND AN INDUSTRIOUS PEOPLE CAN AWAKEN INTO LIFE GROVES OF ORANGE AND LEMON PERFUMED THE AIR
2411-132532-0049 THEY MET WITH SIMPLE BUT NEAT ACCOMMODATION AND WOULD HAVE PASSED A HAPPY EVENING AFTER THE TOILS AND THE DELIGHTS OF THIS DAY HAD NOT THE APPROACHING SEPARATION THROWN A GLOOM OVER THEIR SPIRIT
2411-132532-0050 SINCE HE WAS NOW NEARLY RECOVERED AND HAD NO LONGER A PRETENCE FOR CONTINUING WITH HIS NEW FRIENDS RESOLVED TO LEAVE THEM HERE
2411-132532-0051 BUT DID NOT REPEAT THE INVITATION AND VALANCOURT HAD RESOLUTION ENOUGH TO FOREGO THE TEMPTATION OF ACCEPTING IT
2411-132532-0052 ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THEREFORE THEY WERE TO PART
2411-132532-0053 AND VALANCOURT TO EXPLORE NEW SCENES AMONG THE MOUNTAINS ON HIS RETURN HOME
2411-132532-0054 SAINT AUBERT'S MANNER TOWARDS HIM WAS AFFECTIONATE THOUGH GRAVE AND EMILY WAS SERIOUS THOUGH SHE MADE FREQUENT EFFORTS TO APPEAR CHEERFUL
