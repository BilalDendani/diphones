8273-283130-0000 IT MAY NOT BE IMPROPER IN THIS PLACE TO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF BODILY ENDOWMENTS AND OF THE GOODS OF FORTUNE OVER OUR SENTIMENTS OF REGARD AND ESTEEM AND TO CONSIDER WHETHER THESE PHENOMENA FORTIFY OR WEAKEN THE PRESENT THEORY
8273-283130-0001 IT WILL NATURALLY BE EXPECTED THAT THE BEAUTY OF THE BODY AS IS SUPPOSED BY ALL ANCIENT MORALISTS WILL BE SIMILAR IN SOME RESPECTS TO THAT OF THE MIND AND THAT EVERY KIND OF ESTEEM WHICH IS PAID TO A MAN WILL HAVE SOMETHING SIMILAR IN ITS ORIGIN
8273-283130-0002 WHETHER IT ARISE FROM HIS MENTAL ENDOWMENTS OR FROM THE SITUATION OF HIS EXTERIOR CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS EVIDENT THAT ONE CONSIDERABLE SOURCE OF BEAUTY IN ALL ANIMALS IS THE ADVANTAGE WHICH THEY REAP FROM THE PARTICULAR STRUCTURE OF THEIR LIMBS AND MEMBERS
8273-283130-0003 IDEAS OF UTILITY AND ITS CONTRARY THOUGH THEY DO NOT ENTIRELY DETERMINE WHAT IS HANDSOME OR DEFORMED ARE EVIDENTLY THE SOURCE OF A CONSIDERABLE PART OF APPROBATION OR DISLIKE IN ANCIENT TIMES
8273-283130-0004 BODILY STRENGTH AND DEXTERITY BEING OF GREATER USE AND IMPORTANCE IN WAR
8273-283130-0005 IN ORDER TO SHOW THE IDEA OF PERFECT MERIT WHICH PREVAILED IN THOSE AGES IN OTHER ILLUSTRIOUS MEN SAY HE YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT EACH POSSESSED SOME ONE SHINING QUALITY WHICH WAS THE FOUNDATION OF HIS FAME IN EPAMINONDAS ALL THE VIRTUES ARE FOUND UNITED
8273-283130-0006 THIS INSTANCE IS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE OBSERVED ABOVE WITH REGARD TO MEMORY WHAT DERISION AND CONTEMPT WITH BOTH SEXES ATTEND IMPOTENCE
8273-283130-0007 WHILE THE UNHAPPY OBJECT IS REGARDED AS ONE DEPRIVED OF SO CAPITAL A PLEASURE IN LIFE AND AT THE SAME TIME AS DISABLED FROM COMMUNICATING IT TO OTHERS BARRENNESS IN WOMEN
8273-283130-0008 IS A REPROACH BUT NOT IN THE SAME DEGREE OF WHICH THE REASON IS VERY OBVIOUS ACCORDING TO THE PRESENT THEORY THERE IS NO RULE IN PAINTING OR STATUARY MORE INDISPENSIBLE THAN THAT OF BALANCING THE FIGURES
8273-283130-0009 AND PLACING THEM WITH THE GREATEST EXACTNESS ON THEIR PROPER CENTRE OF GRAVITY A FIGURE WHICH IS NOT JUSTLY BALANCED IS UGLY BECAUSE IT CONVEYS THE DISAGREEABLE IDEAS OF FALL HARM AND PAIN FOOTENOTE
8273-283130-0010 ALL MEN ARE EQUALLY LIABLE TO PAIN AND DISEASE AND SICKNESS AND MAY AGAIN RECOVER HEALTH AND EASE THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AS THEY MAKE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN ONE MAN AND ANOTHER ARE NO SOURCE OF PRIDE OR HUMILITY REGARD OR CONTEMPT
8273-283130-0011 BUT COMPARING OUR OWN SPECIES TO SUPERIOR ONES IT IS A VERY MORTIFYING CONSIDERATION THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE SO LIABLE TO DISEASES AND INFIRMITIES AND DIVINES ACCORDINGLY EMPLOY THIS TOPIC IN ORDER TO DEPRESS SELF CONCEIT AND VANITY
8273-283130-0012 THEY WOULD HAVE MORE SUCCESS IF THE COMMON BENT OF OUR THOUGHTS WERE NOT PERPETUALLY TURNED TO COMPARE OURSELVES WITH OTHERS THE INFIRMITIES OF OLD AGE ARE MORTIFYING BECAUSE A COMPARISON WITH THE YOUNG MAY TAKE PLACE
8273-283130-0013 THE KING'S EVIL IS INDUSTRIOUSLY CONCEALED BECAUSE IT AFFECTS OTHERS AND IS OFTEN TRANSMITTED TO POSTERITY THE CASE IS NEARLY THE SAME WITH SUCH DISEASES AS CONVEY ANY NAUSEOUS OR FRIGHTFUL IMAGES
8273-283130-0014 THE EPILEPSY FOR INSTANCE ULCERS SORES
8273-283130-0015 A DISPOSITION OR TURN OF MIND WHICH QUALIFIES A MAN TO RISE IN THE WORLD AND ADVANCE HIS FORTUNE IS ENTITLED TO ESTEEM AND REGARD AS HAS ALREADY BEEN EXPLAINED IT MAY THEREFORE NATURALLY BE SUPPOSED
8273-283130-0016 THAT THE ACTUAL POSSESSION OF RICHES AND AUTHORITY WILL HAVE A CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE OVER THESE SENTIMENTS LET US EXAMINE ANY HYPOTHESIS BY WHICH WE CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE REGARD PAID TO THE RICH AND POWERFUL WE SHALL FIND NONE SATISFACTORY
8273-283130-0017 BUT THAT WHICH DERIVES IT FROM THE ENJOYMENT COMMUNICATED TO THE SPECTATOR BY THE IMAGES OF PROSPERITY HAPPINESS EASE PLENTY AUTHORITY AND THE GRATIFICATION OF EVERY APPETITE
8273-283130-0018 SELF LOVE FOR INSTANCE WHICH SOME AFFECT SO MUCH TO CONSIDER AS THE SOURCE OF EVERY SENTIMENT IS PLAINLY INSUFFICIENT FOR THIS PURPOSE WHERE NO GOOD WILL OR FRIENDSHIP APPEARS
8273-283130-0019 THOUGH WE NATURALLY RESPECT THE RICH
8273-283130-0020 WE ARE AFFECTED WITH THE SAME SENTIMENTS WHEN WE LIE SO MUCH OUT OF THE SPHERE OF THEIR ACTIVITY THAT THEY CANNOT EVEN BE SUPPOSED TO POSSESS THE POWER OF SERVING US A PRISONER OF WAR IN ALL CIVILIZED NATIONS
8273-283130-0021 AND RICHES IT IS EVIDENT GO FAR TOWARDS FIXING THE CONDITION OF ANY PERSON IF BIRTH AND QUALITY ENTER FOR A SHARE THIS STILL AFFORDS US AN ARGUMENT TO OUR PRESENT PURPOSE FOR WHAT IS IT WE CALL A MAN OF BIRTH
8273-283130-0022 BUT ONE WHO IS DESCENDED FROM A LONG SUCCESSION OF RICH AND POWERFUL ANCESTORS
8273-283130-0023 BUT NOT TO GO SO FAR AS PRISONERS OF WAR OR THE DEAD TO FIND INSTANCES OF THIS DISINTERESTED REGARD FOR RICHES WE MAY ONLY OBSERVE WITH A LITTLE ATTENTION THOSE PHENOMENA WHICH OCCUR IN COMMON LIFE AND CONVERSATION
8273-283130-0024 A MAN WHO IS HIMSELF WE SHALL SUPPOSE OF A COMPETENT FORTUNE AND OF NO PROFESSION BEING INTRODUCED TO A COMPANY OF STRANGERS NATURALLY TREATS THEM WITH DIFFERENT DEGREES OF RESPECT AS HE IS INFORMED OF THEIR DIFFERENT FORTUNES AND CONDITIONS
8273-283130-0025 THOUGH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE CAN SO SUDDENLY PROPOSE AND PERHAPS HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT OF ANY PECUNIARY ADVANTAGE FROM THEM A TRAVELLER IS ALWAYS ADMITTED INTO COMPANY AND MEETS WITH CIVILITY IN PROPORTION AS HIS TRAIN AND EQUIPAGE
8273-283130-0026 IN SHORT THE DIFFERENT RANKS OF MEN ARE IN A GREAT MEASURE REGULATED BY RICHES
8273-283130-0027 WHAT REMAINS THEREFORE BUT TO CONCLUDE THAT AS RICHES ARE DESIRED FOR OURSELVES ONLY AS THE MEANS OF GRATIFYING OUR APPETITES EITHER AT PRESENT OR IN SOME IMAGINARY FUTURE PERIOD THEY BEGET ESTEEM IN OTHERS
8273-283130-0028 MERELY FROM THEIR HAVING THAT INFLUENCE THIS INDEED IS THEIR VERY NATURE OR OFFENCE THEY HAVE A DIRECT REFERENCE TO THE COMMODITIES CONVENIENCES AND PLEASURES OF LIFE THE BILL OF A BANKER WHO IS BROKE
8273-283130-0029 OR GOLD IN A DESERT ISLAND WOULD OTHERWISE BE FULL AS VALUABLE WHEN WE APPROACH A MAN WHO IS AS WE SAY AT HIS EASE WE ARE PRESENTED WITH THE PLEASING IDEAS OF PLENTY SATISFACTION CLEANLINESS WARMTH
8273-283130-0030 A CHEERFUL HOUSE ELEGANT FURNITURE READY SERVICE AND WHATEVER IS DESIRABLE IN MEAT DRINK OR APPAREL ON THE CONTRARY WHEN A POOR MAN APPEARS THE DISAGREEABLE IMAGES OF WANT PENURY HARD LABOUR
8273-283130-0031 DIRTY FURNITURE COARSE OR RAGGED CLOTHES NAUSEOUS MEAT AND DISTASTEFUL LIQUOR IMMEDIATELY STRIKE OUR FANCY
8273-283130-0032 THE OTHER POOR AND AS REGARD OR CONTEMPT IS THE NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THOSE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS IN LIFE
8273-283130-0033 VERY OFTEN ANOTHER'S ADVANCEMENT AND PROSPERITY PRODUCES ENVY WHICH HAS A STRONG MIXTURE OF HATRED AND ARISES CHIEFLY FROM THE COMPARISON OF OURSELVES WITH THE PERSON AT THE VERY SAME TIME
8273-283130-0034 WHICH HAS IN IT A STRONG MIXTURE OF GOOD WILL THIS SENTIMENT OF PITY IS NEARLY ALLIED TO CONTEMPT WHICH IS A SPECIES OF DISLIKE WITH A MIXTURE OF PRIDE I ONLY POINT OUT THESE PHENOMENA
8273-283130-0035 AS A SUBJECT OF SPECULATION TO SUCH AS ARE CURIOUS WITH REGARD TO MORAL ENQUIRIES IT IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE PRESENT PURPOSE TO OBSERVE IN GENERAL THAT POWER AND RICHES COMMONLY CAUSE RESPECT POVERTY AND MEANNESS CONTEMPT
8273-283130-0036 THOUGH PARTICULAR VIEWS AND INCIDENTS MAY SOMETIMES RAISE THE PASSIONS OF ENVY
8273-283130-0037 SUCH A ONE DOES NOT MEASURE OUT DEGREES OF ESTEEM ACCORDING TO THE RENT ROLLS OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE HE MAY INDEED EXTERNALLY PAY A SUPERIOR DEFERENCE TO THE GREAT LORD ABOVE THE VASSAL
8273-283130-0038 BEING THE MOST FIXED AND DETERMINATE SOURCE OF DISTINCTION BUT HIS INTERNAL SENTIMENTS ARE MORE REGULATED BY THE PERSONAL CHARACTERS OF MEN THAN BY THE ACCIDENTAL AND CAPRICIOUS FAVOURS OF FORTUNE IN MOST COUNTRIES OF EUROPE FAMILY
8273-283130-0039 THAT IS HEREDITARY RICHES MARKED WITH TITLES AND SYMBOLS FROM THE SOVEREIGN IS THE CHIEF SOURCE OF DISTINCTION IN ENGLAND MORE REGARD IS PAID TO PRESENT OPULENCE AND PLENTY EACH PRACTICE HAS ITS ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES
8273-283130-0040 WHERE BIRTH IS RESPECTED UNACTIVE SPIRITLESS MINDS REMAIN IN HAUGHTY INDOLENCE AND DREAM OF NOTHING BUT PEDIGREES AND GENEALOGIES
8273-283130-0041 AND REPUTATION AND FAVOUR WHERE RICHES ARE THE CHIEF IDOL
8273-283130-0042 ARTS MANUFACTURES COMMERCE AGRICULTURE FLOURISH THE FORMER PREJUDICE BEING FAVOURABLE TO MILITARY VIRTUE IS MORE SUITED TO MONARCHIES THE LATTER BEING THE CHIEF SPUR TO INDUSTRY AGREES BETTER WITH A REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT
