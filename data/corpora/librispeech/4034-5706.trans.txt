4034-5706-0000 THE FACT THAT THE USAGES ACTIONS AND VIEWS OF THE WELL TO DO LEISURE CLASS ACQUIRE THE CHARACTER OF A PRESCRIPTIVE CANON OF CONDUCT FOR THE REST OF SOCIETY GIVES ADDED WEIGHT AND REACH TO THE CONSERVATIVE INFLUENCE OF THAT CLASS
4034-5706-0001 THERE IS A SECOND WAY IN WHICH THE INFLUENCE OF THE LEISURE CLASS ACTS IN THE SAME DIRECTION SO FAR AS CONCERNS HINDRANCE TO THE ADOPTION OF A CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF LIFE
4034-5706-0002 BUT IT MAY AS WELL BE DEALT WITH HERE SINCE IT HAS AT LEAST THIS MUCH IN COMMON WITH THE CONSERVATIVE HABIT OF MIND THAT IT ACTS TO RETARD INNOVATION AND THE GROWTH OF SOCIAL STRUCTURE
4034-5706-0003 SO THAT ANY APPRECIABLE CHANGE IN ONE POINT OF THE SCHEME INVOLVES SOMETHING OF A CHANGE OR READJUSTMENT AT OTHER POINTS ALSO IF NOT A REORGANIZATION ALL ALONG THE LINE WHEN A CHANGE IS MADE WHICH IMMEDIATELY TOUCHES ONLY A MINOR POINT IN THE SCHEME
4034-5706-0004 WHEN AN ATTEMPTED REFORM INVOLVES THE SUPPRESSION OR THOROUGH GOING REMODELLING OF AN INSTITUTION OF FIRST RATE IMPORTANCE IN THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME IT IS IMMEDIATELY FELT THAT A SERIOUS DERANGEMENT OF THE ENTIRE SCHEME WOULD RESULT
4034-5706-0005 IT IS FELT THAT A READJUSTMENT OF THE STRUCTURE TO THE NEW FORM TAKEN ON BY ONE OF ITS CHIEF ELEMENTS WOULD BE A PAINFUL AND TEDIOUS IF NOT A DOUBTFUL PROCESS IN ORDER TO REALIZE THE DIFFICULTY
4034-5706-0006 WHICH SUCH A RADICAL CHANGE IN ANY ONE FEATURE OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF LIFE WOULD INVOLVE IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO SUGGEST THE SUPPRESSION OF THE MONOGAMIC FAMILY OR OF THE AGNATIC SYSTEM OF CONSANGUINITY OR OF PRIVATE PROPERTY
4034-5706-0007 OR OF THE THEISTIC FAITH IN ANY COUNTRY OF THE WESTERN CIVILIZATION OR SUPPOSE THE SUPPRESSION OF ANCESTOR WORSHIP IN CHINA OR OF THE CASTE SYSTEM IN INDIA OR OF SLAVERY IN AFRICA
4034-5706-0008 OR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF EQUALITY OF THE SEXES IN MOHAMMEDAN COUNTRIES IT NEEDS NO ARGUMENT TO SHOW THAT THE DERANGEMENT OF THE GENERAL STRUCTURE OF CONVENTIONALITIES IN ANY OF THESE CASES WOULD BE VERY CONSIDERABLE
4034-5706-0009 IN ORDER TO EFFECT SUCH AN INNOVATION
4034-5706-0010 THAN THE ONE IMMEDIATELY IN QUESTION THE AVERSION TO ANY SUCH INNOVATION AMOUNTS TO A SHRINKING FROM AN ESSENTIALLY ALIEN SCHEME OF LIFE THE REVULSION FELT BY GOOD PEOPLE AT ANY PROPOSED DEPARTURE FROM THE ACCEPTED METHODS OF LIFE
4034-5706-0011 IS A FAMILIAR FACT OF EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO HEAR THOSE PERSONS WHO DISPENSE SALUTARY ADVICE AND ADMONITION TO THE COMMUNITY EXPRESS THEMSELVES FORCIBLY UPON THE FAR REACHING PERNICIOUS EFFECTS
4034-5706-0012 WHICH THE COMMUNITY WOULD SUFFER FROM SUCH RELATIVELY SLIGHT CHANGES AS THE DISESTABLISHMENT OF THE ANGLICAN CHURCH AN INCREASED FACILITY OF DIVORCE ADOPTION OF FEMALE SUFFRAGE
4034-5706-0013 PROHIBITION OF THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF INTOXICATING BEVERAGES ABOLITION OR RESTRICTION OF INHERITANCES ET CETERA ANY ONE OF THESE INNOVATIONS WOULD WE ARE TOLD SHAKE THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE TO ITS BASE
4034-5706-0014 BUT AT THE SAME TIME LIKE ALL OVERSTATEMENT THEY ARE EVIDENCE OF A LIVELY SENSE OF THE GRAVITY OF THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH THEY ARE INTENDED TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECT OF THESE AND LIKE INNOVATIONS IN DERANGING THE ACCEPTED SCHEME OF LIFE
4034-5706-0015 ARE OF MINOR IMPORTANCE A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS INCREASED RELUCTANCE DUE TO THE SOLIDARITY OF HUMAN INSTITUTIONS IS THAT ANY INNOVATION CALLS FOR A GREATER EXPENDITURE OF NERVOUS ENERGY
4034-5706-0016 A MORE OR LESS PROTRACTED AND LABORIOUS EFFORT TO FIND AND TO KEEP ONE'S BEARINGS UNDER THE ALTERED CIRCUMSTANCES THIS PROCESS REQUIRES A CERTAIN EXPENDITURE OF ENERGY AND SO PRESUMES FOR ITS SUCCESSFUL ACCOMPLISHMENT
4034-5706-0017 NO LESS EFFECTUALLY THAN BY SUCH A LUXURIOUS LIFE AS WILL SHUT OUT DISCONTENT BY CUTTING OFF THE OCCASION FOR IT THE ABJECTLY POOR AND ALL THOSE PERSONS WHOSE ENERGIES ARE ENTIRELY ABSORBED BY THE STRUGGLE FOR DAILY SUSTENANCE
4034-5706-0018 FROM THIS PROPOSITION IT FOLLOWS THAT THE INSTITUTION OF A LEISURE CLASS ACTS TO MAKE THE LOWER CLASSES CONSERVATIVE BY WITHDRAWING FROM THEM AS MUCH AS IT MAY OF THE MEANS OF SUSTENANCE AND SO REDUCING THEIR CONSUMPTION
4034-5706-0019 IMPLIES PRIVATION AT THE LOWER END OF THE SCALE IT IS A COMMONPLACE THAT WHEREVER IT OCCURS A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF PRIVATION AMONG THE BODY OF THE PEOPLE IS A SERIOUS OBSTACLE TO ANY INNOVATION
4034-5706-0020 THE PREVALENCE OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS ONE OF THE MAIN ELEMENTS IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY AMONG ALL CLASSES IS OF COURSE NOT TRACEABLE WHOLLY TO THE EXAMPLE OF THE WEALTHY LEISURE CLASS
4034-5706-0021 BUT THE PRACTICE AND THE INSISTENCE ON IT ARE NO DOUBT STRENGTHENED BY THE EXAMPLE OF THE LEISURE CLASS
4034-5706-0022 IS NOT INFREQUENTLY DIVERTED TO THE PURPOSE OF A CONSPICUOUS DECENCY RATHER THAN TO ADDED PHYSICAL COMFORT AND FULLNESS OF LIFE MOREOVER SUCH SURPLUS ENERGY AS IS AVAILABLE
4034-5706-0023 IS ALSO LIKELY TO BE EXPENDED IN THE ACQUISITION OF GOODS FOR CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OR CONSPICUOUS BOARDING THE RESULT IS THAT THE REQUIREMENTS OF PECUNIARY REPUTABILITY TEND ONE
4034-5706-0024 TO LEAVE BUT A SCANTY SUBSISTENCE MINIMUM AVAILABLE FOR OTHER THAN CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AND TWO
4034-5706-0025 THE ATTITUDE OF THE CLASS SIMPLY AS INFLUENCED BY ITS CLASS INTEREST SHOULD THEREFORE BE TO LET WELL ENOUGH ALONE THIS INTERESTED MOTIVE COMES IN TO SUPPLEMENT THE STRONG INSTINCTIVE BIAS OF THE CLASS
4034-5706-0026 AND SO TO RENDER IT EVEN MORE CONSISTENTLY CONSERVATIVE THAN IT OTHERWISE WOULD BE ALL THIS OF COURSE HAS NOTHING TO SAY IN THE WAY OF EULOGY OR DEPRECATION OF THE OFFICE OF THE LEISURE CLASS AS AN EXPONENT AND VEHICLE OF CONSERVATISM
4034-5706-0027 OR REVERSION IN SOCIAL STRUCTURE THE INHIBITION WHICH IT EXERCISES MAY BE SALUTARY OR THE REVERSE WETHER IT IS THE ONE OR THE OTHER IN ANY GIVEN CASE
4034-5706-0028 THERE MAY BE TRUTH IN THE VIEW AS A QUESTION OF POLICY SO OFTEN EXPRESSED BY THE SPOKESMEN OF THE CONSERVATIVE ELEMENT THAT WITHOUT SOME SUCH SUBSTANTIAL AND CONSISTENT RESISTANCE TO INNOVATION AS IS OFFERED BY THE CONSERVATIVE WELL TO DO CLASSES
4034-5706-0029 THE ONLY POSSIBLE RESULT OF WHICH WOULD BE DISCONTENT AND DISASTROUS REACTION ALL THIS HOWEVER IS BESIDE THE PRESENT ARGUMENT
4034-5706-0030 CONSISTENTLY ACTS TO RETARD THAT ADJUSTMENT TO THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS CALLED SOCIAL ADVANCE OR DEVELOPMENT THE CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE OF THE CLASS MAY BE SUMMED UP IN THE MAXIM
4034-5706-0031 WHEREAS THE LAW OF NATURAL SELECTION AS APPLIED TO HUMAN INSTITUTIONS GIVES THE AXIOM
4034-5706-0032 BUT THEY ARE ALWAYS AND IN THE NATURE OF THINGS WRONG TO SOME EXTENT THEY ARE THE RESULT OF A MORE OR LESS INADEQUATE ADJUSTMENT OF THE METHODS OF LIVING TO A SITUATION WHICH PREVAILED AT SOME POINT IN THE PAST DEVELOPMENT
4034-5706-0033 THEY ARE APPLIED SIMPLY FROM THE MORALLY COLORLESS EVOLUTIONARY STANDPOINT
4034-5706-0034 TAKING THE LATTER WORD IN THE MECHANICAL SENSE THE LATTER CLASS ARE NOT OFTEN RECOGNIZED AS INSTITUTIONS IN GREAT PART BECAUSE THEY DO NOT IMMEDIATELY CONCERN THE RULING CLASS AND ARE THEREFORE SELDOM THE SUBJECT OF LEGISLATION OR OF DELIBERATE CONVENTION
4034-5706-0035 THESE CLASSES HAVE LITTLE ELSE THAN A BUSINESS INTEREST IN THINGS ECONOMIC AND ON THEM AT THE SAME TIME IT IS CHIEFLY INCUMBENT TO DELIBERATE UPON THE COMMUNITY'S AFFAIRS THE RELATION OF THE LEISURE THAT IS PROPERTIED NON INDUSTRIAL
4034-5706-0036 INDIRECTLY THEIR ECONOMIC OFFICE MAY OF COURSE BE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO THE ECONOMIC LIFE PROCESS
4034-5706-0037 THE PURPOSE IS SIMPLY TO POINT OUT WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATION OF THESE CLASSES TO THE INDUSTRIAL PROCESS AND TO ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS THEIR OFFICE IS OF A PARASITIC CHARACTER
4034-5706-0038 OF THE ANCIENT PREDATORY CULTURE BUT THESE PECUNIARY INSTITUTIONS DO NOT ENTIRELY FIT THE SITUATION OF TODAY FOR THEY HAVE GROWN UP UNDER A PAST SITUATION DIFFERING SOMEWHAT FROM THE PRESENT EVEN FOR EFFECTIVENESS IN THE PECUNIARY WAY THEREFORE
4034-5706-0039 AND THE PECUNIARY CLASSES HAVE SOME INTEREST IN SO ADAPTING THE PECUNIARY INSTITUTIONS AS TO GIVE THEM THE BEST EFFECT FOR ACQUISITION OF PRIVATE GAIN THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE CONTINUANCE OF THE INDUSTRIAL PROCESS OUT OF WHICH THIS GAIN ARISES
4034-5706-0040 IS SEEN IN THOSE ENACTMENTS AND CONVENTIONS THAT MAKE FOR SECURITY OF PROPERTY ENFORCEMENT OF CONTRACTS FACILITY OF PECUNIARY TRANSACTIONS VESTED INTERESTS
4034-5706-0041 OF SUCH BEARING ARE CHANGES AFFECTING BANKRUPTCY AND RECEIVERSHIPS LIMITED LIABILITY BANKING AND CURRENCY COALITIONS OF LABORERS OR EMPLOYERS TRUSTS AND POOLS THE COMMUNITY'S INSTITUTIONAL FURNITURE OF THIS KIND
4034-5706-0042 IS OF IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE ONLY TO THE PROPERTIED CLASSES AND IN PROPORTION AS THEY ARE PROPERTIED THAT IS TO SAY IN PROPORTION AS THEY ARE TO BE RANKED WITH THE LEISURE CLASS BUT INDIRECTLY THESE CONVENTIONS OF BUSINESS LIFE ARE OF THE GRAVEST CONSEQUENCE
4034-5706-0043 BUT ALSO IN SHAPING THE INDUSTRIAL PROCESS PROPER THE IMMEDIATE END OF THIS PECUNIARY INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE AND OF ITS AMELIORATION IS THE GREATER FACILITY OF PEACEABLE AND ORDERLY EXPLOITATION
4034-5706-0044 BUT THE RESULTING ELIMINATION OF DISTURBANCES AND COMPLICATIONS CALLING FOR AN EXERCISE OF ASTUTE DISCRIMINATION IN EVERYDAY AFFAIRS
4034-5706-0045 AND SO THEY MAKE ALSO FOR THE DISPENSABILITY OF THE GREAT LEISURE CLASS FUNCTION OF OWNERSHIP
