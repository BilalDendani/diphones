6513-71944-0000 THE HAPPY HOME ONE IMPORTANT RESULT OF THE BRUSH ON THE LAGOON WAS THAT IT MADE THE REDSKINS THEIR FRIENDS PETER HAD SAVED TIGER LILY FROM A DREADFUL FATE AND NOW THERE WAS NOTHING SHE AND HER BRAVES WOULD NOT DO FOR HIM
6513-71944-0001 ALL NIGHT THEY SAT ABOVE KEEPING WATCH OVER THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND AND AWAITING THE BIG ATTACK BY THE PIRATES WHICH OBVIOUSLY COULD NOT BE MUCH LONGER DELAYED EVEN BY DAY THEY HUNG ABOUT SMOKING THE PIPE OF PEACE
6513-71944-0002 AND LOOKING ALMOST AS IF THEY WANTED TIT BITS TO EAT THEY CALLED PETER THE GREAT WHITE FATHER PROSTRATING THEMSELVES BEFORE HIM AND HE LIKED THIS TREMENDOUSLY SO THAT IT WAS NOT REALLY GOOD FOR HIM
6513-71944-0003 THE GREAT WHITE FATHER HE WOULD SAY TO THEM IN A VERY LORDLY MANNER AS THEY GROVELLED AT HIS FEET IS GLAD TO SEE THE PICCANINNY WARRIORS PROTECTING HIS WIGWAM FROM THE PIRATES
6513-71944-0004 ME TIGER LILY THAT LOVELY CREATURE WOULD REPLY PETER PAN SAVE ME ME HIS VELLY NICE FRIEND ME NO LET PIRATES HURT HIM SHE WAS FAR TOO PRETTY TO CRINGE IN THIS WAY
6513-71944-0005 BUT PETER THOUGHT IT HIS DUE AND HE WOULD ANSWER CONDESCENDINGLY IT IS GOOD PETER PAN HAS SPOKEN ALWAYS WHEN HE SAID PETER PAN HAS SPOKEN IT MEANT THAT THEY MUST NOW SHUT UP AND THEY ACCEPTED IT HUMBLY IN THAT SPIRIT
6513-71944-0006 BUT THEY WERE BY NO MEANS SO RESPECTFUL TO THE OTHER BOYS WHOM THEY LOOKED UPON AS JUST ORDINARY BRAVES THEY SAID HOW DO TO THEM AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND WHAT ANNOYED THE BOYS WAS THAT PETER SEEMED TO THINK THIS ALL RIGHT
6513-71944-0007 SECRETLY WENDY SYMPATHISED WITH THEM A LITTLE BUT SHE WAS FAR TOO LOYAL A HOUSEWIFE TO LISTEN TO ANY COMPLAINTS AGAINST FATHER FATHER KNOWS BEST SHE ALWAYS SAID WHATEVER HER PRIVATE OPINION MUST BE
6513-71944-0008 HER PRIVATE OPINION WAS THAT THE REDSKINS SHOULD NOT CALL HER A SQUAW WE HAVE NOW REACHED THE EVENING THAT WAS TO BE KNOWN AMONG THEM AS THE NIGHT OF NIGHTS BECAUSE OF ITS ADVENTURES AND THEIR UPSHOT
6513-71944-0009 AND NOW THE REDSKINS IN THEIR BLANKETS WERE AT THEIR POSTS ABOVE WHILE BELOW THE CHILDREN WERE HAVING THEIR EVENING MEAL ALL EXCEPT PETER WHO HAD GONE OUT TO GET THE TIME THE WAY YOU GOT THE TIME ON THE ISLAND
6513-71944-0010 THIS MEAL HAPPENED TO BE A MAKE BELIEVE TEA AND THEY SAT ROUND THE BOARD GUZZLING IN THEIR GREED AND REALLY WHAT WITH THEIR CHATTER AND RECRIMINATIONS THE NOISE AS WENDY SAID WAS POSITIVELY DEAFENING TO BE SURE
6513-71944-0011 SHE DID NOT MIND NOISE BUT SHE SIMPLY WOULD NOT HAVE THEM GRABBING THINGS AND THEN EXCUSING THEMSELVES BY SAYING THAT TOOTLES HAD PUSHED THEIR ELBOW THERE WAS A FIXED RULE THAT THEY MUST NEVER HIT BACK AT MEALS
6513-71944-0012 I COMPLAIN OF SO AND SO BUT WHAT USUALLY HAPPENED WAS THAT THEY FORGOT TO DO THIS OR DID IT TOO MUCH SILENCE CRIED WENDY WHEN FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME SHE HAD TOLD THEM THAT THEY WERE NOT ALL TO SPEAK AT ONCE
6513-71944-0013 IS YOUR CALABASH EMPTY SLIGHTLY DARLING NOT QUITE EMPTY MUMMY SLIGHTLY SAID AFTER LOOKING INTO AN IMAGINARY MUG HE HASN'T EVEN BEGUN TO DRINK HIS MILK NIBS INTERPOSED
6513-71944-0014 THIS WAS TELLING AND SLIGHTLY SEIZED HIS CHANCE I COMPLAIN OF NIBS
6513-71944-0015 JOHN HOWEVER HAD HELD UP HIS HAND FIRST WELL JOHN MAY I SIT IN PETER'S CHAIR AS HE IS NOT HERE SIT IN FATHER'S CHAIR JOHN
6513-71944-0016 HE IS NOT REALLY OUR FATHER JOHN ANSWERED HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW A FATHER DOES TILL I SHOWED HIM THIS WAS GRUMBLING WE COMPLAIN OF JOHN CRIED THE TWINS TOOTLES HELD UP HIS HAND
6513-71944-0017 HE WAS SO MUCH THE HUMBLEST OF THEM INDEED HE WAS THE ONLY HUMBLE ONE THAT WENDY WAS SPECIALLY GENTLE WITH HIM I DON'T SUPPOSE TOOTLES SAID DIFFIDENTLY THAT I COULD BE FATHER NO TOOTLES
6513-71944-0018 ONCE TOOTLES BEGAN WHICH WAS NOT VERY OFTEN HE HAD A SILLY WAY OF GOING ON AS I CAN'T BE FATHER HE SAID HEAVILY I DON'T SUPPOSE MICHAEL YOU WOULD LET ME BE BABY NO I WON'T
6513-71944-0019 MICHAEL RAPPED OUT HE WAS ALREADY IN HIS BASKET AS I CAN'T BE BABY TOOTLES SAID GETTING HEAVIER AND HEAVIER DO YOU THINK I COULD BE A TWIN NO INDEED REPLIED THE TWINS IT'S AWFULLY DIFFICULT TO BE A TWIN
6513-71944-0020 WOULD ANY OF YOU LIKE TO SEE ME DO A TRICK NO THEY ALL REPLIED THEN AT LAST HE STOPPED I HADN'T REALLY ANY HOPE HE SAID THE HATEFUL TELLING BROKE OUT AGAIN SLIGHTLY IS COUGHING ON THE TABLE

6513-71944-0022 I'M SURE I SOMETIMES THINK THAT CHILDREN ARE MORE TROUBLE THAN THEY ARE WORTH SHE TOLD THEM TO CLEAR AWAY AND SAT DOWN TO HER WORK BASKET
6513-71944-0023 WENDY REMONSTRATED MICHAEL I'M TOO BIG FOR A CRADLE I MUST HAVE SOMEBODY IN A CRADLE SHE SAID ALMOST TARTLY AND YOU ARE THE LITTLEST
6513-71944-0024 WHILE SHE SEWED THEY PLAYED AROUND HER SUCH A GROUP OF HAPPY FACES AND DANCING LIMBS LIT UP BY THAT ROMANTIC FIRE IT HAD BECOME A VERY FAMILIAR SCENE THIS IN THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND BUT WE ARE LOOKING ON IT FOR THE LAST TIME
6513-71944-0025 THERE WAS A STEP ABOVE AND WENDY YOU MAY BE SURE WAS THE FIRST TO RECOGNISE IT CHILDREN I HEAR YOUR FATHER'S STEP HE LIKES YOU TO MEET HIM AT THE DOOR ABOVE THE REDSKINS CROUCHED BEFORE PETER
6513-71944-0026 WATCH WELL BRAVES I HAVE SPOKEN AND THEN AS SO OFTEN BEFORE THE GAY CHILDREN DRAGGED HIM FROM HIS TREE AS SO OFTEN BEFORE BUT NEVER AGAIN HE HAD BROUGHT NUTS FOR THE BOYS
6513-71944-0027 AS WELL AS THE CORRECT TIME FOR WENDY PETER YOU JUST SPOIL THEM YOU KNOW WENDY SIMPERED AH OLD LADY SAID PETER HANGING UP HIS GUN IT WAS ME TOLD HIM MOTHERS ARE CALLED OLD LADY MICHAEL WHISPERED TO CURLY I COMPLAIN OF MICHAEL
6513-71944-0028 SAID CURLY INSTANTLY THE FIRST TWIN CAME TO PETER FATHER WE WANT TO DANCE DANCE AWAY MY LITTLE MAN SAID PETER WHO WAS IN HIGH GOOD HUMOUR BUT WE WANT YOU TO DANCE
6513-71944-0029 PETER WAS REALLY THE BEST DANCER AMONG THEM BUT HE PRETENDED TO BE SCANDALISED ME MY OLD BONES WOULD RATTLE AND MUMMY TOO WHAT CRIED WENDY THE MOTHER OF SUCH AN ARMFUL DANCE
6513-71944-0030 BUT ON A SATURDAY NIGHT SLIGHTLY INSINUATED IT WAS NOT REALLY SATURDAY NIGHT AT LEAST IT MAY HAVE BEEN FOR THEY HAD LONG LOST COUNT OF THE DAYS BUT ALWAYS IF THEY WANTED TO DO ANYTHING SPECIAL
6513-71944-0031 THEY SAID THIS WAS SATURDAY NIGHT AND THEN THEY DID IT OF COURSE IT IS SATURDAY NIGHT PETER WENDY SAID RELENTING PEOPLE OF OUR FIGURE WENDY BUT IT IS ONLY AMONG OUR OWN PROGENY TRUE TRUE
6513-71944-0032 WENDY SAID FRIGHTFULLY GRATIFIED PETER I THINK CURLY HAS YOUR NOSE MICHAEL TAKES AFTER YOU SHE WENT TO HIM AND PUT HER HAND ON HIS SHOULDER DEAR PETER SHE SAID WITH SUCH A LARGE FAMILY OF COURSE
6513-71944-0033 I HAVE NOW PASSED MY BEST BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO CHANGE ME DO YOU NO WENDY CERTAINLY HE DID NOT WANT A CHANGE BUT HE LOOKED AT HER UNCOMFORTABLY BLINKING YOU KNOW LIKE ONE NOT SURE WHETHER HE WAS AWAKE OR ASLEEP PETER WHAT IS IT
6513-71944-0034 I WAS JUST THINKING HE SAID A LITTLE SCARED IT IS ONLY MAKE BELIEVE ISN'T IT THAT I AM THEIR FATHER OH YES WENDY SAID PRIMLY YOU SEE HE CONTINUED APOLOGETICALLY
6513-71944-0035 BUT THEY ARE OURS PETER YOURS AND MINE BUT NOT REALLY WENDY HE ASKED ANXIOUSLY NOT IF YOU DON'T WISH IT SHE REPLIED

6513-71944-0042 LET US REJOICE THAT THERE WERE SIXTY GLAD MINUTES IN IT THEY SANG AND DANCED IN THEIR NIGHT GOWNS SUCH A DELICIOUSLY CREEPY SONG IT WAS IN WHICH THEY PRETENDED TO BE FRIGHTENED AT THEIR OWN SHADOWS
6513-71944-0043 LITTLE WITTING THAT SO SOON SHADOWS WOULD CLOSE IN UPON THEM FROM WHOM THEY WOULD SHRINK IN REAL FEAR SO UPROARIOUSLY GAY WAS THE DANCE
6513-71944-0044 IT WAS A PILLOW FIGHT RATHER THAN A DANCE AND WHEN IT WAS FINISHED THE PILLOWS INSISTED ON ONE BOUT MORE LIKE PARTNERS WHO KNOW THAT THEY MAY NEVER MEET AGAIN THE STORIES THEY TOLD BEFORE IT WAS TIME FOR WENDY'S GOOD NIGHT STORY
6513-71944-0045 EVEN SLIGHTLY TRIED TO TELL A STORY THAT NIGHT BUT THE BEGINNING WAS SO FEARFULLY DULL THAT IT APPALLED EVEN HIMSELF AND HE SAID GLOOMILY YES IT IS A DULL BEGINNING I SAY
6513-71944-0046 LET US PRETEND THAT IT IS THE END AND THEN AT LAST THEY ALL GOT INTO BED FOR WENDY'S STORY THE STORY THEY LOVED BEST
