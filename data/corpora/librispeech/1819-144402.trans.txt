1819-144402-0000 RAGGEDY ANN'S NEW SISTERS MARCELLA WAS HAVING A TEA PARTY UP IN THE NURSERY WHEN DADDY CALLED TO HER
1819-144402-0001 SO SHE LEFT THE DOLLIES SITTING AROUND THE TINY TABLE AND RAN DOWN STAIRS CARRYING RAGGEDY ANN WITH HER MAMA DADDY AND A STRANGE MAN WERE TALKING IN THE LIVING ROOM AND DADDY INTRODUCED MARCELLA TO THE STRANGER
1819-144402-0002 THE STRANGER WAS A LARGE MAN WITH KINDLY EYES AND A CHEERY SMILE AS PLEASANT AS RAGGEDY ANN'S HE TOOK MARCELLA UPON HIS KNEE AND RAN HIS FINGERS THROUGH HER CURLS AS HE TALKED TO DADDY AND MAMMA
1819-144402-0003 SO OF COURSE RAGGEDY ANN LIKED HIM FROM THE BEGINNING I HAVE TWO LITTLE GIRLS HE TOLD MARCELLA THEIR NAMES ARE VIRGINIA AND DORIS AND ONE TIME WHEN WE WERE AT THE SEA SHORE THEY WERE PLAYING IN THE SAND AND THEY COVERED UP FREDDY
1819-144402-0004 JUST AS THE OTHER BATHERS DID AND WHEN THEY HAD COVERED FREDDY THEY TOOK THEIR LITTLE PAILS AND SHOVELS AND WENT FARTHER DOWN THE BEACH TO PLAY AND FORGOT ALL ABOUT FREDDY
1819-144402-0005 VIRGINIA AND DORIS REMEMBERED FREDDY AND RAN DOWN TO GET HIM
1819-144402-0006 IT WAS TOO BAD THEY FORGOT FREDDY SAID MARCELLA YES INDEED IT WAS THE NEW FRIEND REPLIED AS HE TOOK RAGGEDY ANN UP AND MADE HER DANCE ON MARCELLA'S KNEE
1819-144402-0007 BUT IT TURNED OUT ALL RIGHT AFTER ALL FOR DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO FREDDY NO WHAT DID HAPPEN TO HIM MARCELLA ASKED WELL FIRST OF ALL WHEN FREDDY WAS COVERED WITH THE SAND HE ENJOYED IT IMMENSELY
1819-144402-0008 BUT PRESENTLY FREDDY FELT THE SAND ABOVE HIM MOVE AS IF SOMEONE WAS DIGGING HIM OUT
1819-144402-0009 AND WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS HAPPENING THE TIDE FAIRIES WERE UNCOVERING FREDDY WHEN HE WAS COMPLETELY UNCOVERED THE TIDE FAIRIES SWAM WITH FREDDY WAY OUT TO THE UNDERTOW FAIRIES
1819-144402-0010 THE UNDERTOW FAIRIES TOOK FREDDY AND SWAM WITH HIM WAY OUT TO THE ROLLER FAIRIES
1819-144402-0011 WHO CARRIED HIM TO THE WIND FAIRIES AND THE WIND FAIRIES MARCELLA ASKED BREATHLESSLY
1819-144402-0012 NONE THE WORSE FOR HIS WONDERFUL ADVENTURE FREDDY MUST HAVE ENJOYED IT AND YOUR LITTLE GIRLS MUST HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD TO GET FREDDY BACK AGAIN SAID MARCELLA RAGGEDY ANN WENT UP IN THE AIR ON THE TAIL OF A KITE ONE DAY
1819-144402-0013 AND FELL AND WAS LOST SO NOW I AM VERY CAREFUL WITH HER WOULD YOU LET ME TAKE RAGGEDY ANN FOR A FEW DAYS ASKED THE NEW FRIEND
1819-144402-0014 SHE LIKED THE STRANGER FRIEND
1819-144402-0015 WILL YOU LET HER GO WITH ME MARCELLA MARCELLA FINALLY AGREED AND WHEN THE STRANGER FRIEND LEFT HE PLACED RAGGEDY ANN IN HIS GRIP
1819-144402-0016 SAID THE DOLLIES EACH NIGHT WE MISS HER HAPPY PAINTED SMILE AND HER CHEERY WAYS THEY SAID AND SO THE WEEK DRAGGED BY
1819-144402-0017 BUT MY WHAT A CHATTER THERE WAS IN THE NURSERY THE FIRST NIGHT AFTER RAGGEDY ANN RETURNED ALL THE DOLLS WERE SO ANXIOUS TO HUG RAGGEDY ANN THEY COULD SCARCELY WAIT UNTIL MARCELLA HAD LEFT THEM ALONE WHEN THEY HAD SQUEEZED RAGGEDY ANN ALMOST OUT OF SHAPE
1819-144402-0018 AND SHE HAD SMOOTHED OUT HER YARN HAIR PATTED HER APRON OUT AND FELT HER SHOE BUTTON EYES TO SEE IF THEY WERE STILL THERE SHE SAID WELL WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING TELL ME ALL THE NEWS
1819-144402-0019 OH WE HAVE JUST HAD THE USUAL TEA PARTIES AND GAMES SAID THE TIN SOLDIER TELL US ABOUT YOURSELF RAGGEDY DEAR WE HAVE MISSED YOU SO MUCH

1819-144402-0024 THE DOLLS ALL SAT UPON THE FLOOR AROUND RAGGEDY ANN THE TIN SOLDIER WITH HIS ARM OVER HER SHOULDER WELL FIRST WHEN I LEFT SAID RAGGEDY ANN I WAS PLACED IN THE STRANGER FRIEND'S GRIP
1819-144402-0025 IT WAS RATHER STUFFY IN THERE BUT I DID NOT MIND IT IN FACT I BELIEVE I MUST HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP FOR WHEN I AWAKENED I SAW THE STRANGER FRIEND'S HAND REACHING INTO THE GRIP THEN HE LIFTED ME FROM THE GRIP AND DANCED ME UPON HIS KNEE
1819-144402-0026 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER HE ASKED TO THREE OTHER MEN SITTING NEARBY I WAS SO INTERESTED IN LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW I DID NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY SAID FOR WE WERE ON A TRAIN AND THE SCENERY WAS JUST FLYING BY
1819-144402-0027 THEN I WAS PUT BACK IN THE GRIP WHEN NEXT I WAS TAKEN FROM THE GRIP I WAS IN A LARGE CLEAN LIGHT ROOM AND THERE WERE MANY MANY GIRLS ALL DRESSED IN WHITE APRONS
1819-144402-0028 THE STRANGER FRIEND SHOWED ME TO ANOTHER MAN AND TO THE GIRLS WHO TOOK OFF MY CLOTHES CUT MY SEAMS AND TOOK OUT MY COTTON AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY FOUND MY LOVELY CANDY HEART HAD NOT MELTED AT ALL AS I THOUGHT
1819-144402-0029 THEN THEY LAID ME ON A TABLE AND MARKED ALL AROUND MY OUTSIDE EDGES WITH A PENCIL ON CLEAN WHITE CLOTH AND THEN THE GIRLS RE STUFFED ME AND DRESSED ME I STAYED IN THE CLEAN BIG LIGHT ROOM FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS
1819-144402-0030 AND WATCHED MY SISTERS GROW FROM PIECES OF CLOTH INTO RAG DOLLS JUST LIKE MYSELF YOUR SISTERS THE DOLLS ALL EXCLAIMED IN ASTONISHMENT
1819-144402-0031 I MEAN SAID RAGGEDY ANN THAT THE STRANGER FRIEND HAD BORROWED ME FROM MARCELLA SO THAT HE COULD HAVE PATTERNS MADE FROM ME AND BEFORE I LEFT THE BIG CLEAN WHITE ROOM
1819-144402-0032 THERE WHERE HUNDREDS OF RAG DOLLS SO LIKE ME YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TELL US APART
