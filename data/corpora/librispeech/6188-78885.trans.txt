6188-78885-0000 THAT EVERY WOMAN OUGHT TO LIVE WITH A NEEDLE AND THREAD IN HER HAND THE STRANGER THEREFORE HAD NOW AMPLE OCCUPATION BUT AS LABOUR IN COMMON WITH ALL OTHER EVILS IS RELATIVE SHE SUBMITTED CHEERFULLY TO ANY MANUAL TOIL
6188-78885-0001 THAT COULD RESCUE HER FROM THE MENTAL BURTHEN OF EXCITING ILL WILL AND REPROACH TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS ELINOR CAME TO SUMMON HER TO THE DRAWING ROOM THEY WERE ALL ASSEMBLED SHE SAID TO A REHEARSAL
6188-78885-0002 AND IN THE UTMOST CONFUSION FOR WANT OF A PROMPTER NOT A SOUL EXCEPT MISS ARBE KNOWING A WORD OR A CUE OF ANY PART BUT HIS OWN AND MISS ARBE WHO TOOK UPON HER TO REGULATE EVERY THING
6188-78885-0003 PROTESTED THAT SHE COULD NOT CONSENT TO GO ON ANY LONGER IN SO SLOVENLY A MANNER IN THIS DILEMMA IT HAD OCCURRED TO ELINOR TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE STRANGER BUT THE STRANGER DESIRED TO BE EXCUSED MISSUS MAPLE SEEMED NOW TO BE SOFTENED IN HER FAVOUR
6188-78885-0004 AND IT WOULD BE BOTH IMPRUDENT AND IMPROPER TO RISK PROVOKING FRESH IRRITATION BY COMING FORWARD IN AN ENTERPRISE THAT WAS A KNOWN SUBJECT OF DISSENTION ELINOR WHEN SHE HAD FORMED A WISH NEVER LISTENED TO AN OBJECTION
6188-78885-0005 SHE CRIED WHO COULD BELIEVE YOU CAME SO LATELY FROM FRANCE BUT EXAMPLE HAS NO MORE FORCE WITHOUT SYMPATHY THAN PRECEPT HAD WITHOUT OPINION HOWEVER I'LL GET YOU A LICENCE FROM AUNT MAPLE IN A MINUTE SHE WENT DOWN STAIRS
6188-78885-0006 AND RETURNING ALMOST IMMEDIATELY CRIED AUNT MAPLE IS QUITE CONTENTED I TOLD HER I WAS GOING TO SEND FOR MISTER CREEK A HORRIBLE LITTLE PETTIFOGGING WRETCH WHO LIVES IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD AND WHOM SHE PARTICULARLY DETESTS
6188-78885-0007 TO BE OUR PROMPTER AND THIS SO WOEFULLY TORMENTED HER THAT SHE PROPOSED YOU HERSELF I HAVE AMPLE BUSINESS UPON MY HANDS BETWEEN MY COMPANIONS OF THE BUSKIN AND THIS PRAGMATICAL OLD AUNT
6188-78885-0008 TILL I THREATENED TO MAKE OVER LORD TOWNLY TO SIR LYELL SYCAMORE A SMART BEAU AT BRIGHTHELMSTONE
6188-78885-0009 I COULD MANAGE MATTERS NO OTHER WAY PERSONAL REMONSTRANCES WERE VAIN AND THE STRANGER WAS FORCED DOWN STAIRS TO THE THEATRICAL GROUP ALL THAT WAS KNOWN OF HER SITUATION HAVING BEEN SKETCHED BY ELINOR AND DETAILED BY SELINA
6188-78885-0010 THE MIXT PARTY THERE ASSEMBLED WAS PREPARED TO SURVEY HER WITH A CURIOSITY WHICH SHE FOUND EXTREMELY ABASHING SHE REQUESTED TO HAVE THE BOOK OF THE PLAY BUT ELINOR ENGAGED IN ARRANGING THE ENTRANCES AND EXITS DID NOT HEED HER
6188-78885-0011 HARLEIGH HOWEVER COMPREHENDING THE RELIEF WHICH ANY OCCUPATION FOR THE EYES AND HANDS MIGHT AFFORD HER PRESENTED IT TO HER HIMSELF IT PRESERVED HER NOT NEVERTHELESS FROM A VOLLEY OF QUESTIONS
6188-78885-0012 WITH WHICH SHE WAS INSTANTLY ASSAILED FROM VARIOUS QUARTERS I FIND MA'AM YOU ARE LATELY COME FROM ABROAD SAID MISTER SCOPE A GENTLEMAN SELF DUBBED A DEEP POLITICIAN AND WHO IN THE MOST SENTENTIOUS MANNER
6188-78885-0013 UTTERED THE MOST TRIVIAL OBSERVATIONS I HAVE NO VERY HIGH NOTION I OWN OF THE MORALS OF THOSE FOREIGNERS AT THIS PERIOD A MAN'S WIFE AND DAUGHTERS BELONG TO ANY MAN WHO HAS A TASTE TO THEM AS I AM INFORMED
6188-78885-0014 NOTHING IS VERY STRICT MISTER ROBERTSPIERRE AS I AM TOLD IS NOT VERY EXACT IN HIS DEALINGS BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW CRIED GOOCH THE YOUNG FARMER
6188-78885-0015 WHETHER IT BE TRUE OF A REALITY THAT THEY'VE GOT SUCH NUMBERS AND NUMBERS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF RED COATS THERE ALL MADE INTO GENERALS IN THE TWINKLING AS ONE MAY SAY OF AN EYE MONEY MUST BE A VAST SCARCE COMMODITY THERE
6188-78885-0016 SAID MISTER STUBBS THE STEWARD DID YOU EVER HAPPEN TO HEAR MA'AM HOW THEY GO TO WORK TO GET IN THEIR RENTS BEFORE THE STRANGER COULD ATTEMPT ANY REPLY TO THESE SEVERAL ADDRESSES MISS ARBE WHO WAS THE PRINCIPAL PERSON OF THE PARTY
6188-78885-0017 SEATING HERSELF IN THE CHAIR OF HONOUR DESIRED HER TO ADVANCE SAYING I UNDERSTAND YOU SING AND PLAY AMAZINGLY WELL PRAY WHO WERE YOUR MASTERS WHILE THE INCOGNITA HESITATED
6188-78885-0018 MISS BYDEL A COLLATERAL AND UNEDUCATED SUCCESSOR TO A LARGE AND UNEXPECTED FORTUNE SAID PRAY FIRST OF ALL YOUNG WOMAN WHAT TOOK YOU OVER TO FOREIGN PARTS I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT ELINOR NOW BEING READY
6188-78885-0019 CUT SHORT ALL FURTHER INVESTIGATION BY BEGINNING THE REHEARSAL DURING THE FIRST SCENES THE VOICE OF THE INCOGNITA WAS HARDLY AUDIBLE THE CONSTRAINT OF HER FORCED ATTENDANCE AND THE INSURMOUNTABLE AWKWARDNESS OF HER SITUATION
6188-78885-0020 MADE ALL EXERTION DIFFICULT AND HER TONES WERE SO LANGUID AND HER PRONUNCIATION WAS SO INARTICULATE THAT ELINOR BEGAN SERIOUSLY TO BELIEVE THAT SHE MUST STILL HAVE RECOURSE TO MISTER CREEK
6188-78885-0021 SAW THAT SHE WAS TOO LITTLE AT HER EASE TO BE YET JUDGED EVERY ONE ELSE ABSORBED IN HIS PART AND HIMSELF IN THE HOPE OF BEING BEST OR THE SHAME OF BEING WORST
6188-78885-0022 IN THE FEAR OF BEING OUT OR THE CONFUSION OF NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT NEXT WAS TO BE DONE WAS REGARDLESS OF ALL ELSE BUT HIS OWN FANCIED REPUTATION OF THE HOUR
6188-78885-0023 AND THE INACCURACY OF THE PERFORMERS DEMANDED GREATER AID FOUND THE PATIENCE OF HIS JUDGMENT RECOMPENSED AND ITS APPRECIATION OF HER TALENTS JUST HER VOICE FROM SEEMING FEEBLE AND MONOTONOUS BECAME CLEAR AND PENETRATING
6188-78885-0024 IT WAS VARIED WITH THE NICEST DISCRIMINATION FOR THE EXPRESSION OF EVERY CHARACTER CHANGING ITS MODULATION FROM TONES OF SOFTEST SENSIBILITY TO THOSE OF ARCHEST HUMOUR AND FROM REASONING SEVERITY TO THOSE OF UNCULTURED
6188-78885-0025 RUSTICITY WHEN THE REHEARSAL WAS OVER MISS BYDEL WHO HAD NO OTHER IDEA OF THE USE OF SPEECH THAN THAT OF ASKING QUESTIONS SAID
6188-78885-0026 THE STRANGER STOOD STILL IN THE FIRST PLACE TELL ME IF YOU PLEASE WHAT'S YOUR NAME
6188-78885-0027 BUT REMAINED SILENT NAY SAID MISS BYDEL YOUR NAME AT LEAST CAN BE NO SUCH GREAT SECRET FOR YOU MUST BE CALLED SOMETHING OR OTHER IRETON WHO HAD HITHERTO APPEARED DECIDED NOT TO TAKE ANY NOTICE OF HER NOW EXCLAIMED WITH A LAUGH
6188-78885-0028 I WILL TELL YOU WHAT HER NAME IS MISS BYDEL TIS L S THE STRANGER DROPT HER EYES BUT MISS BYDEL NOT COMPREHENDING THAT IRETON MEANT TWO INITIAL LETTERS SAID ELLESS
6188-78885-0029 WELL I SEE NO REASON WHY ANY BODY SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO OWN THEIR NAME IS ELLESS SELINA TITTERING WOULD HAVE CLEARED UP THE MISTAKE BUT IRETON LAUGHING YET MORE HEARTILY MADE HER A SIGN TO LET IT PASS MISS BYDEL CONTINUED
6188-78885-0030 I DON'T WANT TO ASK ANY OF YOUR SECRETS AS I SAY MISSUS ELLESS FOR I UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T LIKE TO TELL THEM BUT IT WILL BE DISCOVERING NO GREAT MATTER TO LET ME KNOW WHETHER YOUR FRIENDS ARE ABROAD OR IN ENGLAND
6188-78885-0031 AND WHAT WAY YOU WERE MAINTAINED BEFORE YOU GOT YOUR PASSAGE OVER IN MISSUS MAPLE'S BOAT DON'T LET THAT YOUNG PERSON GO CRIED MISS ARBE WHO HAD NOW FINISHED THE LABOURS OF HER THEATRICAL PRESIDENCY TILL I HAVE HEARD HER PLAY AND SING
6188-78885-0032 IF SHE IS SO CLEVER AS YOU DESCRIBE HER SHE SHALL PERFORM BETWEEN THE ACTS THE STRANGER DECLARED HER UTTER INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH SUCH A REQUEST WHEN I BELIEVED MYSELF UNHEARD SHE CRIED
6188-78885-0033 MUSICK I IMAGINED MIGHT MAKE ME FOR A FEW MOMENTS FORGET MY DISTRESSES BUT AN EXPECTED PERFORMANCE A PREPARED EXHIBITION
6188-78885-0034 HER VOICE SPOKE GRIEF HER LOOK APPREHENSION YET HER MANNER SO COMPLETELY ANNOUNCED DECISION THAT UNOPPOSED EVEN BY A WORD SHE RE MOUNTED THE STAIRS TO HER CHAMBER
6188-78885-0035 DIRECTED FOR L S AT HER LEISURE SHE OPENED IT AND FOUND TEN BANK NOTES OF TEN POUNDS EACH A MOMENTARY HOPE WHICH SHE HAD INDULGED THAT THIS LETTER BY SOME ACCIDENTAL CONVEYANCE
6188-78885-0036 HAD REACHED HER FROM ABROAD WAS NOW CHANGED INTO THE MOST UNPLEASANT PERPLEXITY SUCH A DONATION COULD NOT COME FROM ANY OF THE FEMALES OF THE FAMILY MISSUS MAPLE WAS MISERLY AND HER ENEMY
6188-78885-0037 AND THE MISS JODDRELS KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT SHE WOULD NOT REFUSE THEIR OPEN ASSISTANCE MISTER HARLEIGH THEREFORE OR MISTER IRETON MUST HAVE CONVEYED THIS TO HER ROOM
6188-78885-0038 IF IT WERE MISTER IRETON SHE CONCLUDED HE MEANT TO ENSNARE HER DISTRESS INTO AN UNGUARDED ACCEPTANCE FOR SOME LATENT PURPOSE OF MISCHIEF IF IT WERE MISTER HARLEIGH HIS WHOLE BEHAVIOUR INCLINED HER TO BELIEVE
6188-78885-0039 THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF SUCH AN ACTION FROM MOTIVES OF PURE BENEVOLENCE BUT SHE COULD BY NO MEANS ACCEPT PECUNIARY AID FROM EITHER AND DETERMINED TO KEEP THE PACKET ALWAYS READY FOR DELIVERY WHEN SHE COULD DISCOVER TO WHOM IT BELONGED
6188-78885-0040 SHE WAS SURPRISED SOON AFTERWARDS BY THE SIGHT OF SELINA I WOULD NOT LET MISTER IRETON HINDER ME FROM COMING TO YOU THIS ONCE SHE CRIED DO WHAT HE COULD
6188-78885-0041 POOR MISS ARBE WHILE SHE WAS TEACHING US ALL WHAT WE HAVE TO DO PUT HER PART INTO HER MUFF AND HER FAVOURITE LITTLE DOG THAT SHE DOATS UPON NOT KNOWING IT WAS THERE POOR THING POKED HIS NOSE INTO THE MUFF TO WARM HIMSELF AND WHEN MISS ARBE CAME TO TAKE HER PART
6188-78885-0042 SHE FOUND HE HAD SUCKED IT AND GNAWED IT AND NIBBLED IT ALL TO TATTERS AND SHE SAYS SHE CAN'T WRITE IT OUT AGAIN IF SHE WAS TO HAVE A DIAMOND A WORD FOR IT AND AS TO US WE HAVE ALL OF US GOT SUCH IMMENSITIES TO DO FOR OURSELVES THAT YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON
6188-78885-0043 FOR I DARE SAY YOU KNOW HOW TO WRITE SO WILL YOU NOW ELLIS FOR THEY HAVE ALL SETTLED BELOW THAT YOUR REAL NAME IS ELLIS THE STRANGER ANSWERED THAT SHE SHOULD GLADLY BE USEFUL IN ANY WAY THAT COULD BE PROPOSED
6188-78885-0044 THE BOOK THEREFORE WAS BROUGHT TO HER WITH WRITING IMPLEMENTS AND SHE DEDICATED HERSELF SO DILIGENTLY TO COPYING THAT THE FOLLOWING MORNING WHEN MISS ARBE WAS EXPECTED THE PART WAS PREPARED MISS ARBE HOWEVER CAME NOT
6188-78885-0045 A NOTE ARRIVED IN HER STEAD STATING THAT SHE HAD BEEN SO EXCEEDINGLY FATIGUED THE PRECEDING DAY IN GIVING SO MANY DIRECTIONS THAT SHE BEGGED THEY WOULD LET SOMEBODY READ HER PART AND REHEARSE WITHOUT HER
6188-78885-0046 AND SHE HOPED THAT SHE SHOULD FIND THEM MORE ADVANCED WHEN SHE JOINED THEM ON MONDAY THE STRANGER WAS NOW SUMMONED NOT ONLY AS PROMPTER BUT TO READ THE PART OF LADY TOWNLY SHE COULD NOT REFUSE
6188-78885-0047 BUT HER COMPLIANCE WAS WITHOUT ANY SORT OF EXERTION FROM A DESIRE TO AVOID NOT PROMOTE SIMILAR CALLS FOR EXHIBITION ELINOR REMARKED TO HARLEIGH HOW INADEQUATE WERE HER TALENTS TO SUCH A CHARACTER
6188-78885-0048 HARLEIGH ACQUIESCED IN THE REMARK YET HIS GOOD OPINION IN ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW WAS AS MUCH HEIGHTENED AS IN THIS IT WAS LOWERED HE SAW THE PART WHICH SHE HAD COPIED FOR MISS ARBE AND THE BEAUTIFUL CLEARNESS OF THE HAND WRITING
6188-78885-0049 AND THE CORRECTNESS OF THE PUNCTUATION AND ORTHOGRAPHY CONVINCED HIM THAT HER EDUCATION HAD BEEN AS SUCCESSFULLY CULTIVATED FOR INTELLECTUAL IMPROVEMENT AS FOR ELEGANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS
