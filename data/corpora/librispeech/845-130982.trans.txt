845-130982-0000 A FIRM UNION WILL BE OF THE UTMOST MOMENT TO THE PEACE AND LIBERTY OF THE STATES AS A BARRIER AGAINST DOMESTIC FACTION AND INSURRECTION IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO READ THE HISTORY OF THE PETTY REPUBLICS OF GREECE AND ITALY
845-130982-0001 WITHOUT FEELING SENSATIONS OF HORROR AND DISGUST AT THE DISTRACTIONS WITH WHICH THEY WERE CONTINUALLY AGITATED AND AT THE RAPID SUCCESSION OF REVOLUTIONS BY WHICH THEY WERE KEPT IN A STATE OF PERPETUAL VIBRATION BETWEEN THE EXTREMES OF TYRANNY AND ANARCHY
845-130982-0002 IF THEY EXHIBIT OCCASIONAL CALMS THESE ONLY SERVE AS SHORT LIVED CONTRAST TO THE FURIOUS STORMS THAT ARE TO SUCCEED IF NOW AND THEN INTERVALS OF FELICITY OPEN TO VIEW WE BEHOLD THEM WITH A MIXTURE OF REGRET
845-130982-0003 ARISING FROM THE REFLECTION THAT THE PLEASING SCENES BEFORE US ARE SOON TO BE OVERWHELMED BY THE TEMPESTUOUS WAVES OF SEDITION AND PARTY RAGE IF MOMENTARY RAYS OF GLORY BREAK FORTH FROM THE GLOOM WHILE THEY DAZZLE US WITH A TRANSIENT AND FLEETING BRILLIANCY
845-130982-0004 THEY AT THE SAME TIME ADMONISH US TO LAMENT THAT THE VICES OF GOVERNMENT SHOULD PERVERT THE DIRECTION AND TARNISH THE LUSTRE OF THOSE BRIGHT TALENTS AND EXALTED ENDOWMENTS FOR WHICH THE FAVORED SOILS THAT PRODUCED THEM HAVE BEEN SO JUSTLY CELEBRATED
845-130982-0005 FROM THE DISORDERS THAT DISFIGURE THE ANNALS OF THOSE REPUBLICS THE ADVOCATES OF DESPOTISM HAVE DRAWN ARGUMENTS NOT ONLY AGAINST THE FORMS OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT BUT AGAINST THE VERY PRINCIPLES OF CIVIL LIBERTY
845-130982-0006 THEY HAVE DECRIED ALL FREE GOVERNMENT AS INCONSISTENT WITH THE ORDER OF SOCIETY AND HAVE INDULGED THEMSELVES IN MALICIOUS EXULTATION OVER ITS FRIENDS AND PARTISANS HAPPILY FOR MANKIND STUPENDOUS FABRICS REARED ON THE BASIS OF LIBERTY
845-130982-0007 WHICH HAVE FLOURISHED FOR AGES HAVE IN A FEW GLORIOUS INSTANCES REFUTED THEIR GLOOMY SOPHISMS AND I TRUST AMERICA WILL BE THE BROAD AND SOLID FOUNDATION OF OTHER EDIFICES NOT LESS MAGNIFICENT
845-130982-0008 WHICH WILL BE EQUALLY PERMANENT MONUMENTS OF THEIR ERRORS BUT IT IS NOT TO BE DENIED THAT THE PORTRAITS THEY HAVE SKETCHED OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT WERE TOO JUST COPIES OF THE ORIGINALS FROM WHICH THEY WERE TAKEN
845-130982-0009 IF IT HAD BEEN FOUND IMPRACTICABLE TO HAVE DEVISED MODELS OF A MORE PERFECT STRUCTURE THE ENLIGHTENED FRIENDS TO LIBERTY WOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO ABANDON THE CAUSE OF THAT SPECIES OF GOVERNMENT AS INDEFENSIBLE THE SCIENCE OF POLITICS HOWEVER
845-130982-0010 LIKE MOST OTHER SCIENCES HAS RECEIVED GREAT IMPROVEMENT THE EFFICACY OF VARIOUS PRINCIPLES IS NOW WELL UNDERSTOOD WHICH WERE EITHER NOT KNOWN AT ALL OR IMPERFECTLY KNOWN TO THE ANCIENTS THE REGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF POWER INTO DISTINCT DEPARTMENTS
845-130982-0011 THE INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATIVE BALANCES AND CHECKS THE INSTITUTION OF COURTS COMPOSED OF JUDGES HOLDING THEIR OFFICES DURING GOOD BEHAVIOR THE REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE IN THE LEGISLATURE BY DEPUTIES OF THEIR OWN ELECTION THESE ARE WHOLLY NEW DISCOVERIES
845-130982-0012 OR HAVE MADE THEIR PRINCIPAL PROGRESS TOWARDS PERFECTION IN MODERN TIMES THEY ARE MEANS AND POWERFUL MEANS BY WHICH THE EXCELLENCES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT MAY BE RETAINED AND ITS IMPERFECTIONS LESSENED OR AVOIDED
845-130982-0013 TO THIS CATALOGUE OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT TEND TO THE AMELIORATION OF POPULAR SYSTEMS OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT I SHALL VENTURE HOWEVER NOVEL IT MAY APPEAR TO SOME TO ADD ONE MORE ON A PRINCIPLE WHICH HAS BEEN MADE THE FOUNDATION OF AN OBJECTION TO THE NEW CONSTITUTION
845-130982-0014 I MEAN THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE ORBIT WITHIN WHICH SUCH SYSTEMS ARE TO REVOLVE EITHER IN RESPECT TO THE DIMENSIONS OF A SINGLE STATE OR TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF SEVERAL SMALLER STATES INTO ONE GREAT CONFEDERACY
845-130982-0015 THE LATTER IS THAT WHICH IMMEDIATELY CONCERNS THE OBJECT UNDER CONSIDERATION IT WILL HOWEVER BE OF USE TO EXAMINE THE PRINCIPLE IN ITS APPLICATION TO A SINGLE STATE WHICH SHALL BE ATTENDED TO IN ANOTHER PLACE THE UTILITY OF A CONFEDERACY
845-130982-0016 AS WELL TO SUPPRESS FACTION AND TO GUARD THE INTERNAL TRANQUILLITY OF STATES AS TO INCREASE THEIR EXTERNAL FORCE AND SECURITY IS IN REALITY NOT A NEW IDEA IT HAS BEEN PRACTICED UPON IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND AGES
845-130982-0017 AND HAS RECEIVED THE SANCTION OF THE MOST APPROVED WRITERS ON THE SUBJECT OF POLITICS THE OPPONENTS OF THE PLAN PROPOSED HAVE WITH GREAT ASSIDUITY CITED AND CIRCULATED THE OBSERVATIONS OF MONTESQUIEU ON THE NECESSITY OF A CONTRACTED TERRITORY FOR A REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT
845-130982-0018 BUT THEY SEEM NOT TO HAVE BEEN APPRISED OF THE SENTIMENTS OF THAT GREAT MAN EXPRESSED IN ANOTHER PART OF HIS WORK NOR TO HAVE ADVERTED TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE PRINCIPLE TO WHICH THEY SUBSCRIBE
845-130982-0019 WHEN MONTESQUIEU RECOMMENDS A SMALL EXTENT FOR REPUBLICS THE STANDARDS HE HAD IN VIEW WERE OF DIMENSIONS FAR SHORT OF THE LIMITS OF ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THESE STATES NEITHER VIRGINIA MASSACHUSETTS PENNSYLVANIA NEW YORK NORTH CAROLINA
845-130982-0020 NOR GEORGIA CAN BY ANY MEANS BE COMPARED WITH THE MODELS FROM WHICH HE REASONED AND TO WHICH THE TERMS OF HIS DESCRIPTION APPLY IF WE THEREFORE TAKE HIS IDEAS ON THIS POINT AS THE CRITERION OF TRUTH
845-130982-0021 WE SHALL BE DRIVEN TO THE ALTERNATIVE EITHER OF TAKING REFUGE AT ONCE IN THE ARMS OF MONARCHY OR OF SPLITTING OURSELVES INTO AN INFINITY OF LITTLE JEALOUS CLASHING TUMULTUOUS COMMONWEALTHS THE WRETCHED NURSERIES OF UNCEASING DISCORD
845-130982-0022 AND THE MISERABLE OBJECTS OF UNIVERSAL PITY OR CONTEMPT SOME OF THE WRITERS WHO HAVE COME FORWARD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE QUESTION SEEM TO HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE DILEMMA AND HAVE EVEN BEEN BOLD ENOUGH TO HINT AT THE DIVISION OF THE LARGER STATES AS A DESIRABLE THING
845-130982-0023 SUCH AN INFATUATED POLICY SUCH A DESPERATE EXPEDIENT MIGHT BY THE MULTIPLICATION OF PETTY OFFICES ANSWER THE VIEWS OF MEN WHO POSSESS NOT QUALIFICATIONS TO EXTEND THEIR INFLUENCE BEYOND THE NARROW CIRCLES OF PERSONAL INTRIGUE
845-130982-0024 BUT IT COULD NEVER PROMOTE THE GREATNESS OR HAPPINESS OF THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA REFERRING THE EXAMINATION OF THE PRINCIPLE ITSELF TO ANOTHER PLACE AS HAS BEEN ALREADY MENTIONED IT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO REMARK HERE THAT
845-130982-0025 IN THE SENSE OF THE AUTHOR WHO HAS BEEN MOST EMPHATICALLY QUOTED UPON THE OCCASION IT WOULD ONLY DICTATE A REDUCTION OF THE SIZE OF THE MORE CONSIDERABLE MEMBERS OF THE UNION BUT WOULD NOT MILITATE AGAINST THEIR BEING ALL COMPREHENDED IN ONE CONFEDERATE GOVERNMENT
845-130982-0026 AND THIS IS THE TRUE QUESTION IN THE DISCUSSION OF WHICH WE ARE AT PRESENT INTERESTED SO FAR ARE THE SUGGESTIONS OF MONTESQUIEU FROM STANDING IN OPPOSITION TO A GENERAL UNION OF THE STATES THAT HE EXPLICITLY TREATS OF A CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC
845-130982-0027 AS THE EXPEDIENT FOR EXTENDING THE SPHERE OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT AND RECONCILING THE ADVANTAGES OF MONARCHY WITH THOSE OF REPUBLICANISM IT IS VERY PROBABLE SAYS HE
845-130982-0028 HAD THEY NOT CONTRIVED A KIND OF CONSTITUTION THAT HAS ALL THE INTERNAL ADVANTAGES OF A REPUBLICAN TOGETHER WITH THE EXTERNAL FORCE OF A MONARCHICAL GOVERNMENT I MEAN A CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC
845-130982-0029 THIS FORM OF GOVERNMENT IS A CONVENTION BY WHICH SEVERAL SMALLER STATES AGREE TO BECOME MEMBERS OF A LARGER ONE WHICH THEY INTEND TO FORM IT IS A KIND OF ASSEMBLAGE OF SOCIETIES THAT CONSTITUTE A NEW ONE CAPABLE OF INCREASING BY MEANS OF NEW ASSOCIATIONS
845-130982-0030 TILL THEY ARRIVE TO SUCH A DEGREE OF POWER AS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED BODY A REPUBLIC OF THIS KIND ABLE TO WITHSTAND AN EXTERNAL FORCE MAY SUPPORT ITSELF WITHOUT ANY INTERNAL CORRUPTIONS
845-130982-0031 THE FORM OF THIS SOCIETY PREVENTS ALL MANNER OF INCONVENIENCES IF A SINGLE MEMBER SHOULD ATTEMPT TO USURP THE SUPREME AUTHORITY HE COULD NOT BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE AN EQUAL AUTHORITY AND CREDIT IN ALL THE CONFEDERATE STATES
845-130982-0032 WERE HE TO HAVE TOO GREAT INFLUENCE OVER ONE THIS WOULD ALARM THE REST WERE HE TO SUBDUE A PART THAT WHICH WOULD STILL REMAIN FREE MIGHT OPPOSE HIM WITH FORCES INDEPENDENT OF THOSE WHICH HE HAD USURPED AND OVERPOWER HIM BEFORE HE COULD BE SETTLED IN HIS USURPATION
845-130982-0033 SHOULD A POPULAR INSURRECTION HAPPEN IN ONE OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES THE OTHERS ARE ABLE TO QUELL IT SHOULD ABUSES CREEP INTO ONE PART THEY ARE REFORMED BY THOSE THAT REMAIN SOUND THE STATE MAY BE DESTROYED ON ONE SIDE AND NOT ON THE OTHER
845-130982-0034 THE CONFEDERACY MAY BE DISSOLVED AND THE CONFEDERATES PRESERVE THEIR SOVEREIGNTY AS THIS GOVERNMENT IS COMPOSED OF SMALL REPUBLICS IT ENJOYS THE INTERNAL HAPPINESS OF EACH AND WITH RESPECT TO ITS EXTERNAL SITUATION
845-130982-0035 IT IS POSSESSED BY MEANS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF LARGE MONARCHIES I HAVE THOUGHT IT PROPER TO QUOTE AT LENGTH THESE INTERESTING PASSAGES BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN A LUMINOUS ABRIDGMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF THE UNION
845-130982-0036 AND MUST EFFECTUALLY REMOVE THE FALSE IMPRESSIONS WHICH A MISAPPLICATION OF OTHER PARTS OF THE WORK WAS CALCULATED TO MAKE THEY HAVE AT THE SAME TIME AN INTIMATE CONNECTION WITH THE MORE IMMEDIATE DESIGN OF THIS PAPER WHICH IS
845-130982-0037 TO ILLUSTRATE THE TENDENCY OF THE UNION TO REPRESS DOMESTIC FACTION AND INSURRECTION A DISTINCTION MORE SUBTLE THAN ACCURATE HAS BEEN RAISED BETWEEN A CONFEDERACY AND A CONSOLIDATION OF THE STATES THE ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTIC OF THE FIRST IS SAID TO BE
845-130982-0038 THE RESTRICTION OF ITS AUTHORITY TO THE MEMBERS IN THEIR COLLECTIVE CAPACITIES WITHOUT REACHING TO THE INDIVIDUALS OF WHOM THEY ARE COMPOSED IT IS CONTENDED THAT THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OUGHT TO HAVE NO CONCERN WITH ANY OBJECT OF INTERNAL ADMINISTRATION
845-130982-0039 AN EXACT EQUALITY OF SUFFRAGE BETWEEN THE MEMBERS HAS ALSO BEEN INSISTED UPON AS A LEADING FEATURE OF A CONFEDERATE GOVERNMENT THESE POSITIONS ARE IN THE MAIN ARBITRARY THEY ARE SUPPORTED NEITHER BY PRINCIPLE NOR PRECEDENT
845-130982-0040 IT HAS INDEED HAPPENED THAT GOVERNMENTS OF THIS KIND HAVE GENERALLY OPERATED IN THE MANNER WHICH THE DISTINCTION TAKEN NOTICE OF SUPPOSES TO BE INHERENT IN THEIR NATURE BUT THERE HAVE BEEN IN MOST OF THEM EXTENSIVE EXCEPTIONS TO THE PRACTICE WHICH SERVE TO PROVE
845-130982-0041 AS FAR AS EXAMPLE WILL GO THAT THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE RULE ON THE SUBJECT AND IT WILL BE CLEARLY SHOWN IN THE COURSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION THAT AS FAR AS THE PRINCIPLE CONTENDED FOR HAS PREVAILED IT HAS BEEN THE CAUSE OF INCURABLE DISORDER AND IMBECILITY IN THE GOVERNMENT
845-130982-0042 THE DEFINITION OF A CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC SEEMS SIMPLY TO BE AN ASSEMBLAGE OF SOCIETIES OR AN ASSOCIATION OF TWO OR MORE STATES INTO ONE STATE THE EXTENT MODIFICATIONS AND OBJECTS OF THE FEDERAL AUTHORITY
845-130982-0043 ARE MERE MATTERS OF DISCRETION SO LONG AS THE SEPARATE ORGANIZATION OF THE MEMBERS BE NOT ABOLISHED SO LONG AS IT EXISTS BY A CONSTITUTIONAL NECESSITY FOR LOCAL PURPOSES THOUGH IT SHOULD BE IN PERFECT SUBORDINATION TO THE GENERAL AUTHORITY OF THE UNION
845-130982-0044 IT WOULD STILL BE IN FACT AND IN THEORY AN ASSOCIATION OF STATES OR A CONFEDERACY THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION SO FAR FROM IMPLYING AN ABOLITION OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS MAKES THEM CONSTITUENT PARTS OF THE NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY
845-130982-0045 BY ALLOWING THEM A DIRECT REPRESENTATION IN THE SENATE AND LEAVES IN THEIR POSSESSION CERTAIN EXCLUSIVE AND VERY IMPORTANT PORTIONS OF SOVEREIGN POWER THIS FULLY CORRESPONDS IN EVERY RATIONAL IMPORT OF THE TERMS WITH THE IDEA OF A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
845-130982-0046 WHICH CONSISTED OF TWENTY THREE CITIES OR REPUBLICS THE LARGEST WERE ENTITLED TO THREE VOTES IN THE COMMON COUNCIL THOSE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS TO TWO AND THE SMALLEST TO ONE THE COMMON COUNCIL HAD THE APPOINTMENT OF ALL THE JUDGES AND MAGISTRATES OF THE RESPECTIVE CITIES
845-130982-0047 THIS WAS CERTAINLY THE MOST DELICATE SPECIES OF INTERFERENCE IN THEIR INTERNAL ADMINISTRATION FOR IF THERE BE ANY THING THAT SEEMS EXCLUSIVELY APPROPRIATED TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IT IS THE APPOINTMENT OF THEIR OWN OFFICERS YET MONTESQUIEU
845-130982-0048 SPEAKING OF THIS ASSOCIATION SAYS WERE I TO GIVE A MODEL OF AN EXCELLENT CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC IT WOULD BE THAT OF LYCIA THUS WE PERCEIVE THAT THE DISTINCTIONS INSISTED UPON WERE NOT WITHIN THE CONTEMPLATION OF THIS ENLIGHTENED CIVILIAN
