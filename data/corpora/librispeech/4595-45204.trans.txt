4595-45204-0000 A STRING OF GOLD BEADS A MOMENT LATER BATES ENTERED WITH A FRESH SUPPLY OF WOOD I WATCHED HIM NARROWLY FOR SOME SIGN OF PERTURBATION BUT HE WAS NOT TO BE CAUGHT OFF GUARD
4595-45204-0001 I WISH YOUD SEE IF IT BELONGS TO THE HOUSE HE EXAMINED THE IMPLEMENT WITH CARE AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
4595-45204-0002 BUT WE SOMETIMES FIND TOOLS LEFT BY THE CARPENTERS THAT WORKED ON THE HOUSE SHALL I PUT THIS IN THE TOOL CHEST SIR NEVER MIND I NEED SUCH A THING NOW AND THEN AND ILL KEEP IT HANDY VERY GOOD MISTER GLENARM
4595-45204-0003 ITS A BIT SHARPER TO NIGHT BUT WERE LIKELY TO HAVE SUDDEN CHANGES AT THIS SEASON I DARE SAY WE WERE NOT GETTING ANYWHERE THE FELLOW WAS CERTAINLY AN INCOMPARABLE ACTOR YOU MUST FIND IT PRETTY LONELY HERE BATES
4595-45204-0004 DONT HESITATE TO GO TO THE VILLAGE WHEN YOU LIKE I THANK YOU MISTER GLENARM BUT I AM NOT MUCH FOR IDLING I KEEP A FEW BOOKS BY ME FOR THE EVENINGS ANNANDALE IS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD EXACTLY CALL A DIVERTING VILLAGE
4595-45204-0005 I FANCY NOT BUT THE CARETAKER OVER AT THE SUMMER RESORT HAS EVEN A LONELIER TIME I SUPPOSE THATS WHAT ID CALL A PRETTY CHEERLESS JOB WATCHING SUMMER COTTAGES IN THE WINTER THATS MORGAN SIR
4595-45204-0006 I MEET HIM OCCASIONALLY WHEN I GO TO THE VILLAGE A VERY WORTHY PERSON I SHOULD CALL HIM ON SLIGHT ACQUAINTANCE NO DOUBT OF IT BATES ANY TIME THROUGH THE WINTER YOU WANT TO HAVE HIM IN FOR A SOCIAL GLASS ITS ALL RIGHT WITH ME
4595-45204-0007 HE MET MY GAZE WITHOUT FLINCHING AND LIGHTED ME TO THE STAIR WITH OUR ESTABLISHED CEREMONY I VOTED HIM AN INTERESTING KNAVE AND REALLY ADMIRED THE COOL WAY IN WHICH HE CARRIED OFF DIFFICULT SITUATIONS I HAD NO INTENTION OF BEING KILLED
4595-45204-0008 AND NOW THAT I HAD DUE WARNING OF DANGER I RESOLVED TO PROTECT MYSELF FROM FOES WITHOUT AND WITHIN BOTH BATES AND MORGAN THE CARETAKER WERE LIARS OF HIGH ATTAINMENT MORGAN WAS MOREOVER A CHEERFUL SCOUNDREL AND EXPERIENCE TAUGHT ME LONG AGO
4595-45204-0009 THAT A KNAVE WITH HUMOR IS DOUBLY DANGEROUS BEFORE GOING TO BED I WROTE A LONG LETTER TO LARRY DONOVAN GIVING HIM A FULL ACCOUNT OF MY ARRIVAL AT GLENARM HOUSE THE THOUGHT OF LARRY ALWAYS CHEERED ME AND AS THE PAGES SLIPPED FROM MY PEN I COULD FEEL HIS SYMPATHY
4595-45204-0010 AND HEAR HIM CHUCKLING OVER THE LIVELY BEGINNING OF MY YEAR AT GLENARM THE IDEA OF BEING FIRED UPON BY AN UNSEEN FOE WOULD I KNEW GIVE LARRY A REAL LIFT OF THE SPIRIT THE NEXT MORNING I WALKED INTO THE VILLAGE MAILED MY LETTER
4595-45204-0011 AND WHEN I WAS A FEW YARDS PAST THEM THEY LAUGHED AT A REMARK BY ONE OF THE NUMBER WHICH I COULD NOT OVERHEAR BUT I AM NOT A PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE PERSON I DID NOT CARE WHAT MY HOOSIER NEIGHBORS SAID OF ME
4595-45204-0012 ALL I ASKED WAS THAT THEY SHOULD REFRAIN FROM SHOOTING AT THE BACK OF MY HEAD THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF MY OWN HOUSE ON THIS DAY I REALLY BEGAN TO WORK I MAPPED OUT A COURSE OF READING SET UP A DRAFTSMANS TABLE I FOUND PUT AWAY IN A CLOSET
4595-45204-0013 AND CONVINCED MYSELF THAT I WAS BEGINNING A YEAR OF DEVOTION TO ARCHITECTURE SUCH WAS I FELT THE ONLY HONEST COURSE I SHOULD WORK EVERY DAY FROM EIGHT UNTIL ONE AND MY LEISURE I SHOULD GIVE TO RECREATION
4595-45204-0014 AND A SEARCH FOR THE MOTIVES THAT LAY BEHIND THE CRAFTS AND ASSAULTS OF MY ENEMIES WHEN I PLUNGED INTO THE WOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON IT WAS WITH THE DEFINITE PURPOSE OF RETURNING TO THE UPPER END OF THE LAKE FOR AN INTERVIEW WITH MORGAN
4595-45204-0015 MORE PARTICULARLY I MAY AS WELL ADMIT FOR A CERTAIN MAROON COLORED CANOE AND A GIRL IN A RED TAM O SHANTER BUT LAKE AND SUMMER COTTAGES WERE MINE ALONE I LANDED AND BEGAN AT ONCE MY SEARCH FOR MORGAN
4595-45204-0016 THERE WERE MANY PATHS THROUGH THE WOODS BACK OF THE COTTAGES AND I FOLLOWED SEVERAL FUTILELY BEFORE I AT LAST FOUND A SMALL HOUSE SNUGLY BID AWAY IN A THICKET OF YOUNG MAPLES THE MAN I WAS LOOKING FOR CAME TO THE DOOR QUICKLY IN RESPONSE TO MY KNOCK
4595-45204-0017 GOOD AFTERNOON MORGAN GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER GLENARM HE SAID TAKING THE PIPE FROM HIS MOUTH THE BETTER TO GRIN AT ME HE SHOWED NO SIGN OF SURPRISE AND I WAS NETTLED BY HIS COOL RECEPTION
4595-45204-0018 THERE WAS PERHAPS A CERTAIN ELEMENT OF RECKLESSNESS IN MY VISIT TO THE HOUSE OF A MAN WHO HAD SHOWN SO SINGULAR AN INTEREST IN MY AFFAIRS AND HIS COOL GREETING VEXED ME MORGAN I BEGAN WONT YOU COME IN AND REST YOURSELF MISTER GLENARM HE INTERRUPTED
4595-45204-0019 I RECKON YOURE TIRED FROM YOUR TRIP OVER THANK YOU NO I SNAPPED SUIT YOURSELF MISTER GLENARM HE SEEMED TO LIKE MY NAME AND GAVE IT A DISAGREEABLE DRAWLING EMPHASIS MORGAN YOU ARE AN INFERNAL BLACKGUARD
4595-45204-0020 HE LIFTED THE GRAY FEDORA HAT FROM HIS HEAD AND POKED HIS FINGER THROUGH A HOLE IN THE TOP YOURE A PRETTY FAIR SHOT MISTER GLENARM THE FACT ABOUT ME IS AND HE WINKED THE HONEST TRUTH IS
4595-45204-0021 WHY SIR WHEN I SAW YOU PADDLING OUT ON THE LAKE THIS AFTERNOON I SIGHTED YOU FROM THE CASINO HALF A DOZEN TIMES WITH MY GUN BUT I WAS AFRAID TO RISK IT HE SEEMED TO BE SHAKEN WITH INNER MIRTH
4595-45204-0022 FOR A NOVEL DIVERSION I HEARTILY RECOMMEND A MEETING WITH THE ASSASSIN WHO HAS ONLY A FEW DAYS OR HOURS BEFORE TRIED TO MURDER YOU I KNOW OF NOTHING IN THE WAY OF SOCIAL ADVENTURE THAT IS QUITE EQUAL TO IT MORGAN WAS A FELLOW OF INTELLIGENCE
4595-45204-0023 AND WHATEVER LAY BACK OF HIS DESIGNS AGAINST ME HE WAS CLEARLY A FOE TO RECKON WITH HE STOOD IN THE DOORWAY CALMLY AWAITING MY NEXT MOVE I STRUCK A MATCH ON MY BOX AND LIGHTED A CIGARETTE MORGAN
4595-45204-0024 YOURE NOT QUITE THE MAN YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS MISTER GLENARM YOULL EXCUSE MY BLUNTNESS BUT I TAKE IT THAT YOURE A FRANK MAN
4595-45204-0025 HE CHUCKLED WITH EVIDENT SATISFACTION TO HIMSELF
4595-45204-0026 THERE YOU HAVE IT MORGAN I FULLY AGREE WITH YOU
4595-45204-0027 YOU SEEM LIKE A PRETTY DECENT FELLOW TOO AND IM SORRY I DIDNT SEE YOU SOONER BUT BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME HE STROKED HIS YELLOW BEARD REFLECTIVELY AND SHOOK HIS HEAD A LITTLE SADLY HE WAS NOT A BAD LOOKING FELLOW AND HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF WELL ENOUGH WITH A BROAD WESTERN ACCENT
4595-45204-0028 WELL I SAID SEEING THAT I SHOULD ONLY MAKE MYSELF RIDICULOUS BY TRYING TO LEARN ANYTHING FROM HIM I HOPE OUR LITTLE SPATS THROUGH WINDOWS AND ON WALLS WONT INTERFERE WITH OUR PLEASANT SOCIAL RELATIONS AND I DONT HESITATE TO TELL YOU
4595-45204-0029 I WAS EXERTING MYSELF TO KEEP DOWN MY ANGER THAT IF I CATCH YOU ON MY GROUNDS AGAIN
4595-45204-0030 AND SINK YOU IN THE LAKE THANK YOU SIR HE SAID WITH SO PERFECT AN IMITATION OF BATES VOICE AND MANNER THAT I SMILED IN SPITE OF MYSELF AND NOW IF YOULL PROMISE NOT TO FIRE INTO MY BACK ILL WISH YOU GOOD DAY OTHERWISE
4595-45204-0031 HE SNATCHED OFF HIS HAT AND BOWED PROFOUNDLY ITLL SUIT ME MUCH BETTER TO CONTINUE HANDLING THE CASE ON YOUR GROUNDS HE SAID AS THOUGH HE REFERRED TO A BUSINESS MATTER KILLING A MAN ON YOUR OWN PROPERTY REQUIRES SOME EXPLAININGYOU
4595-45204-0032 YES I COMMIT MOST OF MY MURDERS AWAY FROM HOME I SAID I FORMED THE HABIT EARLY IN LIFE GOOD DAY MORGAN AS I TURNED AWAY HE CLOSED HIS DOOR WITH A SLAM
4595-45204-0033 A DELICATE WAY OF ASSURING ME THAT HE WAS ACTING IN GOOD FAITH AND NOT PREPARING TO PUNCTURE MY BACK WITH A RIFLE BALL I REGAINED THE LAKE SHORE FEELING NO GREAT DISCOURAGEMENT OVER THE LEAN RESULTS OF MY INTERVIEW BUT RATHER A FRESH ZEST FOR THE GAME WHATEVER THE GAME MIGHT BE
4595-45204-0034 THE SUN WAS GOING HIS RUDDY WAY BEYOND SAINT AGATHAS AS I DROVE MY CANOE INTO A LITTLE COVE NEAR WHICH THE GIRL IN THE TAM O SHANTER HAD DISAPPEARED THE DAY BEFORE THE SHORE WAS HIGH HERE
4595-45204-0035 AND AT THE CREST WAS A LONG CURVED BENCH OF STONE REACHED BY HALF A DOZEN STEPS FROM WHICH ONE MIGHT ENJOY A WIDE VIEW OF THE COUNTRY BOTH ACROSS THE LAKE AND DIRECTLY INLAND
4595-45204-0036 BOLDLY REMINISCENTIAL OF ALMA TADEMA AND AS CLEARLY THE CREATION OF JOHN MARSHALL GLENARM AS THOUGH HIS NAME HAD BEEN CARVED UPON IT IT WAS ASSUREDLY A SPOT FOR A PIPE AND A MOOD AND AS THE SHADOWS CREPT THROUGH THE WOOD BEFORE ME AND THE WATER STIRRED BY THE RISING WIND BEGAN TO BEAT BELOW
4595-45204-0037 I INVOKED THE ONE AND YIELDED TO THE OTHER SOMETHING IN THE WITHERED GRASS AT MY FEET CAUGHT MY EYE I BENT AND PICKED UP A STRING OF GOLD BEADS DROPPED THERE NO DOUBT BY SOME GIRL FROM THE SCHOOL OR A CARELESS MEMBER OF THE SUMMER COLONY
4595-45204-0038 I COUNTED THE SEPARATE BEADSTHEY WERE ROUND AND THERE WERE FIFTY OF THEM THE PROPER LENGTH FOR ONE TURN ABOUT A GIRLS THROAT PERHAPS NOT MORE THAN THAT I LIFTED MY EYES AND LOOKED OFF TOWARD SAINT AGATHAS
4595-45204-0039 AND I ADMIRED EVEN MORE THE WAY YOU SPURNED ME WHEN YOU SAW THAT AMONG ALL THE CADS IN THE WORLD I AM NUMBER ONE IN CLASS A AND THESE GOLDEN BUBBLES O GIRL OF THE RED TAM O SHANTER IF THEY ARE NOT YOURS YOU SHALL HELP ME FIND THE OWNER FOR WE ARE NEIGHBORS YOU AND I
4595-45204-0040 AND THERE MUST BE PEACE BETWEEN OUR HOUSES WITH THIS FOOLISHNESS I ROSE THRUST THE BEADS INTO MY POCKET AND PADDLED HOME IN THE WANING GLORY OF THE SUNSET THAT NIGHT AS I WAS GOING QUITE LATE TO BED BEARING A CANDLE TO LIGHT ME THROUGH THE DARK HALL TO MY ROOM
4595-45204-0041 I HEARD A CURIOUS SOUND AS OF SOME ONE WALKING STEALTHILY THROUGH THE HOUSE AT FIRST I THOUGHT BATES WAS STILL ABROAD BUT I WAITED LISTENING FOR SEVERAL MINUTES WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO MARK THE EXACT DIRECTION OF THE SOUND OR TO IDENTIFY IT WITH HIM I WENT ON TO THE DOOR OF MY ROOM
4595-45204-0042 AND STILL A MUFFLED STEP SEEMED TO FOLLOW ME FIRST IT HAD COME FROM BELOW THEN IT WAS MUCH LIKE SOME ONE GOING UP STAIRS BUT WHERE IN MY OWN ROOM I STILL HEARD STEPS LIGHT SLOW BUT DISTINCT AGAIN THERE WAS A STUMBLE
4595-45204-0043 AND A HURRIED RECOVERY GHOSTS I REFLECTED DO NOT FALL DOWN STAIRS
