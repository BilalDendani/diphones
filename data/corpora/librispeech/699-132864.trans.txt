699-132864-0007 BOX ONE THOUSAND THE TIMES FOR PARTICULARS SHE ASKED FOR ALL PARTICULARS BUT THE ONLY ONE THEY REALLY WANTED WAS THE ONE ABOUT THE RENT THEY BOTH FELT THAT IT WAS MISSUS ARBUTHNOT WHO OUGHT TO WRITE THE LETTER AND DO THE BUSINESS PART
699-132864-0008 SUGGESTED A GREAT CALM THAT COULD ONLY PROCEED FROM WISDOM BUT IF SHE WAS WISER OLDER AND CALMER MISSUS ARBUTHNOT'S NEW FRIEND
699-132864-0009 NEVERTHELESS SEEMED TO HER TO BE THE ONE WHO IMPELLED INCOHERENT SHE YET IMPELLED SHE APPEARED TO HAVE APART FROM HER NEED OF HELP AN UPSETTING KIND OF CHARACTER

699-132864-0012 AS THEY TURNED AWAY FROM THE LETTER BOX HOW IMMACULATELY GOOD WE'VE BEEN ALL OUR LIVES
699-132864-0013 WE FEEL GUILTY I'M AFRAID I CAN'T SAY I'VE BEEN IMMACULATELY GOOD GENTLY PROTESTED MISSUS ARBUTHNOT A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE AT THIS FRESH EXAMPLE OF SUCCESSFUL LEAPING AT CONCLUSIONS

699-132864-0017 SHE FELT THAT MISSUS WILKINS NEEDED HOLDING ON TO AFTER ALL WE'VE ONLY WRITTEN JUST TO ASK ANYBODY MAY DO THAT I THINK IT QUITE LIKELY WE SHALL FIND THE CONDITIONS IMPOSSIBLE
699-132864-0018 MISSUS ARBUTHNOT AS SHE PRESENTLY SPLASHED THOUGH THE DRIPPING STREETS ON HER WAY TO A MEETING SHE WAS TO SPEAK AT WAS IN AN UNUSUALLY DISTURBED CONDITION OF MIND SHE HAD SHE HOPED
699-132864-0019 SHOWN HERSELF VERY CALM TO MISSUS WILKINS VERY PRACTICAL AND SOBER CONCEALING HER OWN EXCITEMENT BUT SHE WAS REALLY EXTRAORDINARILY MOVED AND SHE FELT HAPPY AND SHE FELT GUILTY
699-132864-0020 AND SHE FELT AFRAID AND SHE HAD ALL THE FEELINGS THOUGH THIS SHE DID NOT KNOW OF A WOMAN WHO WAS COME AWAY FROM A SECRET MEETING WITH HER LOVER THAT INDEED WAS WHAT SHE LOOKED LIKE
699-132864-0021 EACH ONE CONVINCED THAT THEY NEEDED CONTRIBUTIONS THEMSELVES SHE LOOKED AS THOUGH SHE WERE HIDING SOMETHING DISCREDITABLE BUT DELIGHTFUL CERTAINLY HER CUSTOMARY CLEAR EXPRESSION OF CANDOR WAS NOT THERE
699-132864-0022 AND ITS PLACE WAS TAKEN BY A KIND OF SUPPRESSED AND FRIGHTENED PLEASEDNESS WHICH WOULD HAVE LED A MORE WORLDLY MINDED AUDIENCE TO THE INSTANT CONVICTION OF RECENT AND PROBABLY IMPASSIONED LOVEMAKING
699-132864-0023 OR EVEN TO REFLECT WERE USELESS IT YET INFLUENCED HER MISSUS WILKINS'S EYES HAD BEEN THE EYES OF A SEER SOME PEOPLE WERE LIKE THAT MISSUS ARBUTHNOT KNEW
699-132864-0024 MISSUS ARBUTHNOT SPOKE ON AND ON
699-132864-0025 AND AT THE END OF THE MEETING HER EYES
699-132864-0026 PERHAPS THEY NEED A HOLIDAY SUGGESTED MISSUS ARBUTHNOT AN UNSATISFACTORY A QUEER REPLY THE VICAR THOUGHT IN FEBRUARY HE CALLED AFTER HER SARCASTICALLY
699-132864-0027 OH NO NOT TILL APRIL SAID MISSUS ARBUTHNOT OVER HER SHOULDER VERY ODD THOUGHT THE VICAR VERY ODD INDEED AND HE WENT HOME AND WAS NOT PERHAPS QUITE CHRISTIAN
699-132864-0028 IT COULD BE THE NEXT NEST EGG WHOSE ORIGINAL CORRUPTION WOULD BE PURGED AWAY BY THE USE TO WHICH IT WAS FINALLY PUT FOR MISSUS ARBUTHNOT WHO HAD NO MONEY OF HER OWN WAS OBLIGED TO LIVE ON THE PROCEEDS OF FREDERICK'S ACTIVITIES
699-132864-0029 SO THAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO PUBLISH A BOOK OF MEMOIRS DURING EACH YEAR OF HIS MARRIED LIFE AND EVEN SO THERE WERE GREATER FURTHER PILES OF THESE LADIES WAITING TO BE DEALT WITH MISSUS ARBUTHNOT WAS HELPLESS
699-132864-0030 PEOPLE WOULD CEASE TO WANT TO READ OF WICKEDNESS AND THEN FREDERICK WOULD NEED SUPPORTING ON HELPING THE POOR THE PARISH FLOURISHED BECAUSE TO TAKE A HANDFUL AT RANDOM
699-132864-0031 OF LEARNED MAINTENON THE POOR WERE THE FILTER THROUGH WHICH THE MONEY WAS PASSED TO COME OUT MISSUS ARBUTHNOT HOPED PURIFIED SHE COULD DO NO MORE
699-132864-0032 SHE HAD TRIED IN DAYS GONE BY TO THINK THE SITUATION OUT TO DISCOVER THE EXACT RIGHT COURSE FOR HER TO TAKE BUT HAD FOUND IT AS SHE HAD FOUND FREDERICK TOO DIFFICULT AND HAD LEFT IT
699-132864-0033 AS SHE HAD LEFT FREDERICK TO GOD NOTHING OF THIS MONEY WAS SPENT ON HER HOUSE OR DRESS THOSE REMAINED EXCEPT FOR THE GREAT SOFT SOFA AUSTERE
699-132864-0034 IT WAS THE POOR WHO PROFITED THEIR VERY BOOTS WERE STOUT WITH SINS BUT HOW DIFFICULT IT HAD BEEN MISSUS ARBUTHNOT GROPING FOR GUIDANCE PRAYED ABOUT IT TO EXHAUSTION
699-132864-0035 HE ONLY BEGAN IT AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE WHEN SHE MARRIED HIM HE HAD BEEN A BLAMELESS OFFICIAL ATTACHED TO THE LIBRARY OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM TO PUBLISH THE MEMOIRS UNDER ANOTHER NAME SO THAT SHE WAS NOT PUBLICLY BRANDED HAMPSTEAD READ THE BOOKS WITH GLEE
699-132864-0036 HE TOLD MISSUS ARBUTHNOT AS A MATTER OF HONOUR NOT TO MENTION IT AND AT LEAST HER LITTLE HOUSE WAS NOT HAUNTED BY THE LOOSE LIVED LADIES FOR FREDERICK DID HIS WORK AWAY FROM HOME HE HAD TWO ROOMS NEAR THE BRITISH MUSEUM
699-132864-0037 WHICH WAS THE SCENE OF HIS EXHUMATIONS AND THERE HE WENT EVERY MORNING AND HE CAME BACK LONG AFTER HIS WIFE WAS ASLEEP SOMETIMES HE DID NOT COME BACK AT ALL SOMETIMES SHE DID NOT SEE HIM FOR SEVERAL DAYS TOGETHER
699-132864-0038 THEN HE WOULD SUDDENLY APPEAR AT BREAKFAST HAVING LET HIMSELF IN WITH HIS LATCHKEY THE NIGHT BEFORE VERY JOVIAL AND GOOD NATURED AND FREE HANDED AND GLAD IF SHE WOULD ALLOW HIM TO GIVE HER SOMETHING A WELL FED MAN CONTENTED WITH THE WORLD
699-132864-0039 HOWEVER MUCH ONE TABULATED WAS YET A MYSTERY THERE WERE ALWAYS SOME PEOPLE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLACE FREDERICK WAS ONE OF THEM HE DIDN'T SEEM TO BEAR THE REMOTEST RESEMBLANCE TO THE ORIGINAL FREDERICK
699-132864-0040 HE DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE THE LEAST NEED OF ANY OF THE THINGS HE USED TO SAY WERE SO IMPORTANT AND BEAUTIFUL LOVE HOME COMPLETE COMMUNION OF THOUGHTS COMPLETE IMMERSION IN EACH OTHER'S INTERESTS
699-132864-0041 AFTER THOSE EARLY PAINFUL ATTEMPTS TO HOLD HIM UP TO THE POINT FROM WHICH THEY HAD HAND IN HAND SO SPLENDIDLY STARTED ATTEMPTS IN WHICH SHE HERSELF HAD GOT TERRIBLY HURT AND THE FREDERICK SHE SUPPOSED SHE HAD MARRIED WAS MANGLED OUT OF RECOGNITION
699-132864-0042 SHE HUNG HIM UP FINALLY BY HER BEDSIDE AS THE CHIEF SUBJECT OF HER PRAYERS AND LEFT HIM EXCEPT FOR THOSE ENTIRELY TO GOD SHE HAD LOVED FREDERICK TOO DEEPLY
699-132864-0043 SHE HAD NOTHING NOBODY OF HER OWN TO LAVISH HERSELF ON THE POOR BECAME HER CHILDREN AND GOD THE OBJECT OF HER LOVE WHAT COULD BE HAPPIER THAN SUCH A LIFE SHE SOMETIMES ASKED HERSELF
699-132864-0044 BUT HER FACE AND PARTICULARLY HER EYES CONTINUED SAD PERHAPS WHEN WE'RE OLD PERHAPS WHEN WE ARE BOTH QUITE OLD
