1603-139324-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE GRAHAM SPEAKS HIS WORD
1603-139324-0001 THE MASTER OF THE EARTH WAS NOT EVEN MASTER OF HIS OWN MIND EVEN HIS WILL SEEMED A WILL NOT HIS OWN HIS OWN ACTS SURPRISED HIM
1603-139324-0002 THESE THINGS WERE DEFINITE THE NEGROES WERE COMING HELEN WOTTON HAD WARNED THE PEOPLE OF THEIR COMING AND HE WAS MASTER OF THE EARTH EACH OF THESE FACTS SEEMED STRUGGLING FOR COMPLETE POSSESSION OF HIS THOUGHTS THEY PROTRUDED FROM A BACKGROUND OF SWARMING HALLS
1603-139324-0003 ELEVATED PASSAGES ROOMS JAMMED WITH WARD LEADERS IN COUNCIL KINEMATOGRAPH AND TELEPHONE ROOMS AND WINDOWS LOOKING OUT ON A SEETHING SEA OF MARCHING MEN THE MEN IN YELLOW AND MEN WHOM HE FANCIED WERE CALLED WARD LEADERS
1603-139324-0004 PERHAPS THEY WERE DOING A LITTLE OF BOTH PERHAPS SOME POWER UNSEEN AND UNSUSPECTED PROPELLED THEM ALL HE WAS AWARE THAT HE WAS GOING TO MAKE A PROCLAMATION TO THE PEOPLE OF THE EARTH AWARE OF CERTAIN GRANDIOSE PHRASES FLOATING IN HIS MIND AS THE THING HE MEANT TO SAY
1603-139324-0005 MANY LITTLE THINGS HAPPENED AND THEN HE FOUND HIMSELF WITH THE MAN IN YELLOW ENTERING A LITTLE ROOM WHERE THIS PROCLAMATION OF HIS WAS TO BE MADE THIS ROOM WAS GROTESQUELY LATTER DAY IN ITS APPOINTMENTS IN THE CENTRE WAS A BRIGHT OVAL
1603-139324-0006 LIT BY SHADED ELECTRIC LIGHTS FROM ABOVE THE REST WAS IN SHADOW AND THE DOUBLE FINELY FITTING DOORS THROUGH WHICH HE CAME FROM THE SWARMING HALL OF THE ATLAS MADE THE PLACE VERY STILL THE DEAD THUD OF THESE AS THEY CLOSED BEHIND HIM
1603-139324-0007 THE SUDDEN CESSATION OF THE TUMULT IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN LIVING FOR HOURS THE QUIVERING CIRCLE OF LIGHT THE WHISPERS AND QUICK NOISELESS MOVEMENTS OF VAGUELY VISIBLE ATTENDANTS IN THE SHADOWS HAD A STRANGE EFFECT UPON GRAHAM
1603-139324-0008 HE WALKED INTO THE CENTRE OF THE LIGHT AND HIS SHADOW DREW TOGETHER BLACK AND SHARP TO A LITTLE BLOT AT HIS FEET THE VAGUE SHAPE OF THE THING HE MEANT TO SAY WAS ALREADY IN HIS MIND BUT THIS SILENCE THIS ISOLATION THE WITHDRAWAL FROM THAT CONTAGIOUS CROWD
1603-139324-0009 THIS AUDIENCE OF GAPING GLARING MACHINES HAD NOT BEEN IN HIS ANTICIPATION ALL HIS SUPPORTS SEEMED WITHDRAWN TOGETHER HE SEEMED TO HAVE DROPPED INTO THIS SUDDENLY SUDDENLY TO HAVE DISCOVERED HIMSELF IN A MOMENT HE WAS CHANGED
1603-139324-0010 HE FOUND THAT HE NOW FEARED TO BE INADEQUATE HE FEARED TO BE THEATRICAL HE FEARED THE QUALITY OF HIS VOICE THE QUALITY OF HIS WIT ASTONISHED HE TURNED TO THE MAN IN YELLOW WITH A PROPITIATORY GESTURE FOR A MOMENT HE SAID I MUST WAIT
1603-139324-0011 I MUST THINK OF THE THING I HAVE TO SAY
1603-139324-0012 THERE CAME AN AGITATED MESSENGER WITH NEWS THAT THE FOREMOST AEROPLANES WERE PASSING OVER MADRID WHAT NEWS OF THE FLYING STAGES HE ASKED THE PEOPLE OF THE SOUTH WEST WARDS ARE READY READY
1603-139324-0013 I SUPPOSE IT MUST BE A SORT OF SPEECH WOULD TO GOD I KNEW CERTAINLY THE THING THAT SHOULD BE SAID AEROPLANES AT MADRID THEY MUST HAVE STARTED BEFORE THE MAIN FLEET OH WHAT CAN IT MATTER WHETHER I SPEAK WELL OR ILL HE SAID AND FELT THE LIGHT GROW BRIGHTER
1603-139324-0014 HE HAD FRAMED SOME VAGUE SENTENCE OF DEMOCRATIC SENTIMENT WHEN SUDDENLY DOUBTS OVERWHELMED HIM HIS BELIEF IN HIS HEROIC QUALITY AND CALLING HE FOUND HAD ALTOGETHER LOST ITS ASSURED CONVICTION
1603-139324-0015 HE THOUGHT OF THAT SWIFT FLIGHT OF AEROPLANES LIKE THE SWOOP OF FATE TOWARDS HIM HE WAS ASTONISHED THAT HE COULD HAVE SEEN THINGS IN ANY OTHER LIGHT IN THAT FINAL EMERGENCY HE DEBATED THRUST DEBATE RESOLUTELY ASIDE DETERMINED AT ALL COSTS TO GO THROUGH WITH THE THING HE HAD UNDERTAKEN
1603-139324-0016 AND HE COULD FIND NO WORD TO BEGIN EVEN AS HE STOOD AWKWARD HESITATING WITH AN INDISCREET APOLOGY FOR HIS INABILITY TREMBLING ON HIS LIPS CAME THE NOISE OF MANY PEOPLE CRYING OUT
1603-139324-0017 WAIT CRIED SOMEONE AND A DOOR OPENED GRAHAM TURNED AND THE WATCHING LIGHTS WANED THROUGH THE OPEN DOORWAY HE SAW A SLIGHT GIRLISH FIGURE APPROACHING HIS HEART LEAPT IT WAS HELEN WOTTON THE MAN IN YELLOW CAME OUT OF THE NEARER SHADOWS INTO THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT
1603-139324-0018 THIS IS THE GIRL WHO TOLD US WHAT OSTROG HAD DONE HE SAID SHE CAME IN VERY QUIETLY AND STOOD STILL AS IF SHE DID NOT WANT TO INTERRUPT GRAHAM'S ELOQUENCE
1603-139324-0019 HE TURNED BACK TO HER YOU HAVE HELPED ME HE SAID LAMELY HELPED ME VERY MUCH THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT HE PAUSED HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE UNSEEN MULTITUDES WHO STARED UPON HIM THROUGH THOSE GROTESQUE BLACK EYES AT FIRST HE SPOKE SLOWLY
1603-139324-0020 MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NEW AGE HE SAID YOU HAVE ARISEN TO DO BATTLE FOR THE RACE THERE IS NO EASY VICTORY BEFORE US HE STOPPED TO GATHER WORDS HE WISHED PASSIONATELY FOR THE GIFT OF MOVING SPEECH
1603-139324-0021 THIS BATTLE THAT IS COMING THIS BATTLE THAT RUSHES UPON US TO NIGHT IS ONLY A BEGINNING ALL YOUR LIVES IT MAY BE YOU MUST FIGHT TAKE NO THOUGHT THOUGH I AM BEATEN THOUGH I AM UTTERLY OVERTHROWN I THINK I MAY BE OVERTHROWN
1603-139324-0022 HE FOUND THE THING IN HIS MIND TOO VAGUE FOR WORDS HE PAUSED MOMENTARILY AND BROKE INTO VAGUE EXHORTATIONS AND THEN A RUSH OF SPEECH CAME UPON HIM MUCH THAT HE SAID WAS BUT THE HUMANITARIAN COMMONPLACE OF A VANISHED AGE
1603-139324-0023 BUT THE CONVICTION OF HIS VOICE TOUCHED IT TO VITALITY HE STATED THE CASE OF THE OLD DAYS TO THE PEOPLE OF THE NEW AGE TO THE GIRL AT HIS SIDE I COME OUT OF THE PAST TO YOU HE SAID WITH THE MEMORY OF AN AGE THAT HOPED
1603-139324-0024 MY AGE WAS AN AGE OF DREAMS OF BEGINNINGS AN AGE OF NOBLE HOPES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WE HAD MADE AN END OF SLAVERY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WE HAD SPREAD THE DESIRE AND ANTICIPATION THAT WARS MIGHT CEASE THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN MIGHT LIVE NOBLY
1603-139324-0025 IN FREEDOM AND PEACE SO WE HOPED IN THE DAYS THAT ARE PAST AND WHAT OF THOSE HOPES HOW IS IT WITH MAN AFTER TWO HUNDRED YEARS GREAT CITIES VAST POWERS A COLLECTIVE GREATNESS BEYOND OUR DREAMS FOR THAT WE DID NOT WORK
1603-139324-0026 AND THAT HAS COME BUT HOW IS IT WITH THE LITTLE LIVES THAT MAKE UP THIS GREATER LIFE HOW IS IT WITH THE COMMON LIVES AS IT HAS EVER BEEN SORROW AND LABOUR LIVES CRAMPED AND UNFULFILLED LIVES TEMPTED BY POWER TEMPTED BY WEALTH
1603-139324-0027 AND GONE TO WASTE AND FOLLY THE OLD FAITHS HAVE FADED AND CHANGED THE NEW FAITH IS THERE A NEW FAITH CHARITY AND MERCY HE FLOUNDERED BEAUTY AND THE LOVE OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS EFFORT AND DEVOTION
1603-139324-0028 GIVE YOURSELVES AS I WOULD GIVE MYSELF AS CHRIST GAVE HIMSELF UPON THE CROSS IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU UNDERSTAND IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU SEEM TO FAIL YOU KNOW IN THE CORE OF YOUR HEARTS YOU KNOW THERE IS NO PROMISE
1603-139324-0029 BUT WITH ALL HIS HEART AND STRENGTH OF THIS NEW FAITH WITHIN HIM HE SPOKE OF THE GREATNESS OF SELF ABNEGATION OF HIS BELIEF IN AN IMMORTAL LIFE OF HUMANITY IN WHICH WE LIVE AND MOVE AND HAVE OUR BEING HIS VOICE ROSE AND FELL
1603-139324-0030 NO DOUBT OF HIS HEROIC WORDS HE HAD IT ALL STRAIGHT AND PLAIN HIS ELOQUENCE LIMPED NO LONGER AND AT LAST HE MADE AN END TO SPEAKING HERE AND NOW HE CRIED I MAKE MY WILL ALL THAT IS MINE IN THE WORLD
1603-139324-0031 ALL THAT IS MINE IN THE WORLD I GIVE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD TO ALL OF YOU I GIVE IT TO YOU AND MYSELF I GIVE TO YOU AND AS GOD WILLS TO NIGHT I WILL LIVE FOR YOU OR I WILL DIE HE ENDED
1603-139324-0032 HE FOUND THE LIGHT OF HIS PRESENT EXALTATION REFLECTED IN THE FACE OF THE GIRL THEIR EYES MET HER EYES WERE SWIMMING WITH TEARS OF ENTHUSIASM I KNEW SHE WHISPERED OH FATHER OF THE WORLD SIRE I KNEW YOU WOULD SAY THESE THINGS
