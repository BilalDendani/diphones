3779-691-0000 BUT IN THE DRAWING ROOM THE CONVERSATION WAS ALREADY OVER
3779-691-0001 THOUGH SHE LOOKED RESOLUTE AT THE MOMENT ALYOSHA AND MADAME HOHLAKOV ENTERED IVAN FYODOROVITCH STOOD UP TO TAKE LEAVE HIS FACE WAS RATHER PALE AND ALYOSHA LOOKED AT HIM ANXIOUSLY
3779-691-0002 FOR THIS MOMENT WAS TO SOLVE A DOUBT A HARASSING ENIGMA WHICH HAD FOR SOME TIME HAUNTED ALYOSHA DURING THE PRECEDING MONTH IT HAD BEEN SEVERAL TIMES SUGGESTED TO HIM THAT HIS BROTHER IVAN
3779-691-0003 WAS IN LOVE WITH KATERINA IVANOVNA AND WHAT WAS MORE THAT HE MEANT TO CARRY HER OFF FROM DMITRI UNTIL QUITE LATELY THE IDEA SEEMED TO ALYOSHA MONSTROUS THOUGH IT WORRIED HIM EXTREMELY
3779-691-0004 HE LOVED BOTH HIS BROTHERS AND DREADED SUCH RIVALRY BETWEEN THEM MEANTIME DMITRI HAD SAID OUTRIGHT ON THE PREVIOUS DAY THAT HE WAS GLAD THAT IVAN WAS HIS RIVAL
3779-691-0005 AND THAT IT WAS A GREAT ASSISTANCE TO HIM DMITRI IN WHAT WAY DID IT ASSIST HIM TO MARRY GRUSHENKA BUT THAT ALYOSHA CONSIDERED THE WORST THING POSSIBLE
3779-691-0006 BESIDES ALL THIS ALYOSHA HAD TILL THE EVENING BEFORE IMPLICITLY BELIEVED THAT KATERINA IVANOVNA HAD A STEADFAST AND PASSIONATE LOVE FOR DMITRI
3779-691-0007 BUT HE HAD ONLY BELIEVED IT TILL THE EVENING BEFORE HE HAD FANCIED TOO THAT SHE WAS INCAPABLE OF LOVING A MAN LIKE IVAN AND THAT SHE DID LOVE DMITRI AND LOVED HIM JUST AS HE WAS
3779-691-0008 IN SPITE OF ALL THE STRANGENESS OF SUCH A PASSION BUT DURING YESTERDAY'S SCENE WITH GRUSHENKA ANOTHER IDEA HAD STRUCK HIM THE WORD LACERATING WHICH MADAME HOHLAKOV HAD JUST UTTERED ALMOST MADE HIM START
3779-691-0009 BECAUSE HALF WAKING UP TOWARDS DAYBREAK THAT NIGHT HE HAD CRIED OUT LACERATION LACERATION PROBABLY APPLYING IT TO HIS DREAM HE HAD BEEN DREAMING ALL NIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS DAY'S SCENE AT KATERINA IVANOVNA'S
3779-691-0010 NOW ALYOSHA WAS IMPRESSED BY MADAME HOHLAKOV'S BLUNT AND PERSISTENT ASSERTION THAT KATERINA IVANOVNA WAS IN LOVE WITH IVAN AND ONLY DECEIVED HERSELF THROUGH SOME SORT OF POSE FROM SELF LACERATION
3779-691-0011 AND TORTURED HERSELF BY HER PRETENDED LOVE FOR DMITRI FROM SOME FANCIED DUTY OF GRATITUDE YES HE THOUGHT PERHAPS THE WHOLE TRUTH LIES IN THOSE WORDS BUT IN THAT CASE
3779-691-0012 ALYOSHA FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT A CHARACTER LIKE KATERINA IVANOVNA'S MUST DOMINATE AND SHE COULD ONLY DOMINATE SOME ONE LIKE DMITRI AND NEVER A MAN LIKE IVAN
3779-691-0013 FOR DMITRI MIGHT AT LAST SUBMIT TO HER DOMINATION TO HIS OWN HAPPINESS WHICH WAS WHAT ALYOSHA WOULD HAVE DESIRED BUT IVAN NO IVAN COULD NOT SUBMIT TO HER
3779-691-0014 AND SUCH SUBMISSION WOULD NOT GIVE HIM HAPPINESS ALYOSHA COULD NOT HELP BELIEVING THAT OF IVAN AND NOW ALL THESE DOUBTS AND REFLECTIONS FLITTED THROUGH HIS MIND AS HE ENTERED THE DRAWING ROOM
3779-691-0015 ANOTHER IDEA TOO FORCED ITSELF UPON HIM WHAT IF SHE LOVED NEITHER OF THEM NEITHER IVAN NOR DMITRI IT MUST BE NOTED THAT ALYOSHA FELT AS IT WERE
3779-691-0016 ASHAMED OF HIS OWN THOUGHTS AND BLAMED HIMSELF WHEN THEY KEPT RECURRING TO HIM DURING THE LAST MONTH WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT LOVE AND WOMEN AND HOW CAN I DECIDE SUCH QUESTIONS HE THOUGHT REPROACHFULLY
3779-691-0017 AFTER SUCH DOUBTS AND SURMISES AND YET IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT HE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT THIS RIVALRY WAS OF IMMENSE IMPORTANCE IN HIS BROTHERS LIVES AND THAT A GREAT DEAL DEPENDED UPON IT
3779-691-0018 ONE REPTILE WILL DEVOUR THE OTHER IVAN HAD PRONOUNCED THE DAY BEFORE SPEAKING IN ANGER OF HIS FATHER AND DMITRI SO IVAN LOOKED UPON DMITRI AS A REPTILE
3779-691-0019 WAS IT PERHAPS SINCE HE HAD KNOWN KATERINA IVANOVNA THAT PHRASE HAD OF COURSE ESCAPED IVAN UNAWARES YESTERDAY BUT THAT ONLY MADE IT MORE IMPORTANT IF HE FELT LIKE THAT WHAT CHANCE WAS THERE OF PEACE
3779-691-0020 WERE THERE NOT ON THE CONTRARY NEW GROUNDS FOR HATRED AND HOSTILITY IN THEIR FAMILY AND WITH WHICH OF THEM WAS ALYOSHA TO SYMPATHIZE AND WHAT WAS HE TO WISH FOR EACH OF THEM HE LOVED THEM BOTH
3779-691-0021 BUT WHAT COULD HE DESIRE FOR EACH IN THE MIDST OF THESE CONFLICTING INTERESTS HE MIGHT GO QUITE ASTRAY IN THIS MAZE AND ALYOSHA'S HEART COULD NOT ENDURE UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE HIS LOVE WAS ALWAYS OF AN ACTIVE CHARACTER
3779-691-0022 HE WAS INCAPABLE OF PASSIVE LOVE IF HE LOVED ANY ONE HE SET TO WORK AT ONCE TO HELP HIM AND TO DO SO HE MUST KNOW WHAT HE WAS AIMING AT HE MUST KNOW FOR CERTAIN WHAT WAS BEST FOR EACH
3779-691-0023 AND HAVING ASCERTAINED THIS IT WAS NATURAL FOR HIM TO HELP THEM BOTH BUT INSTEAD OF A DEFINITE AIM HE FOUND NOTHING BUT UNCERTAINTY AND PERPLEXITY ON ALL SIDES IT WAS LACERATING
3779-691-0024 AS WAS SAID JUST NOW BUT WHAT COULD HE UNDERSTAND EVEN IN THIS LACERATION HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE FIRST WORD IN THIS PERPLEXING MAZE SEEING ALYOSHA KATERINA IVANOVNA SAID QUICKLY AND JOYFULLY TO IVAN
3779-691-0025 I WANT TO HEAR THE OPINION OF THIS PERSON HERE WHOM I TRUST ABSOLUTELY DON'T GO AWAY SHE ADDED ADDRESSING MADAME HOHLAKOV SHE MADE ALYOSHA SIT DOWN BESIDE HER AND MADAME HOHLAKOV SAT OPPOSITE BY IVAN
3779-691-0026 YOU ARE ALL MY FRIENDS HERE
3779-691-0027 AND ALYOSHA'S HEART WARMED TO HER AT ONCE YOU ALEXEY FYODOROVITCH
3779-691-0028 AND SAW WHAT I DID YOU DID NOT SEE IT IVAN FYODOROVITCH HE DID WHAT HE THOUGHT OF ME YESTERDAY I DON'T KNOW I ONLY KNOW ONE THING THAT IF IT WERE REPEATED TO DAY THIS MINUTE
3779-691-0029 I SHOULD EXPRESS THE SAME FEELINGS AGAIN AS YESTERDAY THE SAME FEELINGS THE SAME WORDS THE SAME ACTIONS YOU REMEMBER MY ACTIONS ALEXEY FYODOROVITCH YOU CHECKED ME IN ONE OF THEM AS SHE SAID THAT
3779-691-0030 SHE FLUSHED AND HER EYES SHONE I MUST TELL YOU THAT I CAN'T GET OVER IT LISTEN ALEXEY FYODOROVITCH I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHETHER I STILL LOVE HIM I FEEL PITY FOR HIM
3779-691-0031 AND THAT IS A POOR SIGN OF LOVE IF I LOVED HIM IF I STILL LOVED HIM
3779-691-0032 BUT SHOULD HATE HIM HER VOICE QUIVERED AND TEARS GLITTERED ON HER EYELASHES
3779-691-0033 THAT GIRL IS TRUTHFUL AND SINCERE HE THOUGHT AND SHE DOES NOT LOVE DMITRI ANY MORE THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE CRIED MADAME HOHLAKOV WAIT DEAR I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU THE CHIEF
3779-691-0034 THE FINAL DECISION I CAME TO DURING THE NIGHT I FEEL THAT PERHAPS MY DECISION IS A TERRIBLE ONE FOR ME BUT I FORESEE THAT NOTHING WILL INDUCE ME TO CHANGE IT NOTHING IT WILL BE SO ALL MY LIFE
3779-691-0035 HE KNOWS IT YES I APPROVE OF IT IVAN ASSENTED IN A SUBDUED BUT FIRM VOICE BUT I SHOULD LIKE ALYOSHA TOO AH ALEXEY FYODOROVITCH
3779-691-0036 FORGIVE MY CALLING YOU SIMPLY ALYOSHA I SHOULD LIKE ALEXEY FYODOROVITCH TOO TO TELL ME BEFORE MY TWO FRIENDS WHETHER I AM RIGHT I FEEL INSTINCTIVELY THAT YOU ALYOSHA MY DEAR BROTHER
3779-691-0037 FOR YOU ARE A DEAR BROTHER TO ME SHE SAID AGAIN ECSTATICALLY TAKING HIS COLD HAND IN HER HOT ONE I FORESEE THAT YOUR DECISION YOUR APPROVAL
3779-691-0038 WILL BRING ME PEACE IN SPITE OF ALL MY SUFFERINGS FOR AFTER YOUR WORDS I SHALL BE CALM AND SUBMIT I FEEL THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ASKING ME SAID ALYOSHA FLUSHING
3779-691-0039 I ONLY KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU AND AT THIS MOMENT WISH FOR YOUR HAPPINESS MORE THAN MY OWN BUT I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT SUCH AFFAIRS SOMETHING IMPELLED HIM TO ADD HURRIEDLY IN SUCH AFFAIRS ALEXEY FYODOROVITCH IN SUCH AFFAIRS
3779-691-0040 THE CHIEF THING IS HONOR AND DUTY AND SOMETHING HIGHER I DON'T KNOW WHAT BUT HIGHER PERHAPS EVEN THAN DUTY I AM CONSCIOUS OF THIS IRRESISTIBLE FEELING IN MY HEART AND IT COMPELS ME IRRESISTIBLY
3779-691-0041 BUT IT MAY ALL BE PUT IN TWO WORDS I'VE ALREADY DECIDED EVEN IF HE MARRIES THAT CREATURE SHE BEGAN SOLEMNLY WHOM I NEVER NEVER CAN FORGIVE
3779-691-0042 EVEN THEN I WILL NOT ABANDON HIM HENCEFORWARD I WILL NEVER NEVER ABANDON HIM SHE CRIED BREAKING INTO A SORT OF PALE HYSTERICAL ECSTASY NOT THAT I WOULD RUN AFTER HIM CONTINUALLY
3779-691-0043 GET IN HIS WAY AND WORRY HIM OH NO I WILL GO AWAY TO ANOTHER TOWN WHERE YOU LIKE BUT I WILL WATCH OVER HIM ALL MY LIFE I WILL WATCH OVER HIM ALL MY LIFE UNCEASINGLY
3779-691-0044 WHEN HE BECOMES UNHAPPY WITH THAT WOMAN AND THAT IS BOUND TO HAPPEN QUITE SOON LET HIM COME TO ME AND HE WILL FIND A FRIEND A SISTER ONLY A SISTER OF COURSE AND SO FOR EVER BUT
3779-691-0045 I WILL BE A GOD TO WHOM HE CAN PRAY AND THAT AT LEAST HE OWES ME FOR HIS TREACHERY AND FOR WHAT I SUFFERED YESTERDAY THROUGH HIM AND LET HIM SEE THAT ALL MY LIFE I WILL BE TRUE TO HIM
3779-691-0046 AND THE PROMISE I GAVE HIM IN SPITE OF HIS BEING UNTRUE AND BETRAYING ME I WILL I WILL BECOME NOTHING BUT A MEANS FOR HIS HAPPINESS OR HOW SHALL I SAY AN INSTRUMENT A MACHINE FOR HIS HAPPINESS
3779-691-0047 AND THAT FOR MY WHOLE LIFE MY WHOLE LIFE AND THAT HE MAY SEE THAT ALL HIS LIFE THAT'S MY DECISION IVAN FYODOROVITCH FULLY APPROVES ME SHE WAS BREATHLESS
3779-691-0048 SHE HAD PERHAPS INTENDED TO EXPRESS HER IDEA WITH MORE DIGNITY ART AND NATURALNESS BUT HER SPEECH WAS TOO HURRIED AND CRUDE IT WAS FULL OF YOUTHFUL IMPULSIVENESS
3779-691-0049 IT BETRAYED THAT SHE WAS STILL SMARTING FROM YESTERDAY'S INSULT AND THAT HER PRIDE CRAVED SATISFACTION
3779-691-0050 NO ANY OTHER WOMAN WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG BUT YOU ARE RIGHT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT BUT I SEE THAT YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY GENUINE AND THEREFORE YOU ARE RIGHT
3779-691-0051 AND WHAT DOES THIS MOMENT STAND FOR NOTHING BUT YESTERDAY'S INSULT
3779-691-0052 BUT SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM THIS VERY JUST COMMENT QUITE SO QUITE SO CRIED IVAN WITH PECULIAR EAGERNESS OBVIOUSLY ANNOYED AT BEING INTERRUPTED
3779-691-0053 IN ANY ONE ELSE THIS MOMENT WOULD BE ONLY DUE TO YESTERDAY'S IMPRESSION AND WOULD BE ONLY A MOMENT BUT WITH KATERINA IVANOVNA'S CHARACTER THAT MOMENT WILL LAST ALL HER LIFE
3779-691-0054 WHAT FOR ANY ONE ELSE WOULD BE ONLY A PROMISE IS FOR HER AN EVERLASTING BURDENSOME GRIM PERHAPS BUT UNFLAGGING DUTY AND SHE WILL BE SUSTAINED BY THE FEELING OF THIS DUTY BEING FULFILLED
3779-691-0055 YOUR LIFE KATERINA IVANOVNA WILL HENCEFORTH BE SPENT IN PAINFUL BROODING OVER YOUR OWN FEELINGS YOUR OWN
3779-691-0056 AND YOUR OWN SUFFERING BUT IN THE END THAT SUFFERING WILL BE SOFTENED AND WILL PASS INTO SWEET CONTEMPLATION OF THE FULFILLMENT OF A BOLD AND PROUD DESIGN YES PROUD IT CERTAINLY IS
3779-691-0057 AND DESPERATE IN ANY CASE BUT A TRIUMPH FOR YOU AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF IT WILL AT LAST BE A SOURCE OF COMPLETE SATISFACTION AND WILL MAKE YOU RESIGNED TO EVERYTHING
