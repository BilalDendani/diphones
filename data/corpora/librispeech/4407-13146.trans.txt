4407-13146-0000 WITH TWO OR THREE OTHER TRINKETS SMALL IN THEMSELVES BUT OF GREAT REGARD WHICH POOR TOM THE CORPORAL'S UNFORTUNATE BROTHER HAD SENT HIM OVER WITH THE ACCOUNT OF HIS MARRIAGE WITH THE JEW'S WIDOW THERE WAS A MONTERO CAP AND TWO TURKISH TOBACCO PIPES
4407-13146-0001 THE MONTERO CAP I SHALL DESCRIBE BY AND BYE THE TURKISH TOBACCO PIPES HAD NOTHING PARTICULAR IN THEM THEY WERE FITTED UP AND ORNAMENTED AS USUAL WITH FLEXIBLE TUBES OF MOROCCO LEATHER AND GOLD WIRE
4407-13146-0002 THE OTHER WITH BLACK EBONY TIPP'D WITH SILVER MY FATHER WHO SAW ALL THINGS IN LIGHTS DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD WOULD SAY TO THE CORPORAL THAT HE OUGHT TO LOOK UPON THESE TWO PRESENTS MORE AS TOKENS OF HIS BROTHER'S NICETY THAN HIS AFFECTION TOM DID NOT CARE TRIM
4407-13146-0003 HE WOULD SAY TO PUT ON THE CAP OR TO SMOKE IN THE TOBACCO PIPE OF A JEW GOD BLESS YOUR HONOUR THE CORPORAL WOULD SAY
4407-13146-0004 WAS SCARLET OF A SUPERFINE SPANISH CLOTH DYED IN GRAIN AND MOUNTED ALL ROUND WITH FUR EXCEPT ABOUT FOUR INCHES IN THE FRONT WHICH WAS FACED WITH A LIGHT BLUE SLIGHTLY EMBROIDERED
4407-13146-0005 NOT OF FOOT BUT OF HORSE AS THE WORD DENOTES THE CORPORAL WAS NOT A LITTLE PROUD OF IT AS WELL FOR ITS OWN SAKE AS THE SAKE OF THE GIVER SO SELDOM OR NEVER PUT IT ON BUT UPON GALA DAYS
4407-13146-0006 AND YET NEVER WAS A MONTERO CAP PUT TO SO MANY USES FOR IN ALL CONTROVERTED POINTS WHETHER MILITARY OR CULINARY PROVIDED THE CORPORAL WAS SURE HE WAS IN THE RIGHT IT WAS EITHER HIS OATH HIS WAGER OR HIS GIFT
4407-13146-0007 I'LL BE BOUND SAID THE CORPORAL SPEAKING TO HIMSELF TO GIVE AWAY MY MONTERO CAP TO THE FIRST BEGGAR WHO COMES TO THE DOOR IF I DO NOT MANAGE THIS MATTER TO HIS HONOUR'S SATISFACTION THE COMPLETION WAS NO FURTHER OFF THAN THE VERY NEXT MORNING
4407-13146-0008 WHICH WAS THAT OF THE STORM OF THE COUNTERSCARP BETWIXT THE LOWER DEULE TO THE RIGHT AND THE GATE SAINT ANDREW AND ON THE LEFT BETWEEN SAINT MAGDALEN'S AND THE RIVER
4407-13146-0009 AND I MUST ADD THE MOST BLOODY TOO FOR IT COST THE ALLIES THEMSELVES THAT MORNING ABOVE ELEVEN HUNDRED MEN MY UNCLE TOBY PREPARED HIMSELF FOR IT WITH A MORE THAN ORDINARY SOLEMNITY THE EVE WHICH PRECEDED AS MY UNCLE TOBY WENT TO BED
4407-13146-0010 WHICH HAD LAID INSIDE OUT FOR MANY YEARS IN THE CORNER OF AN OLD CAMPAIGNING TRUNK WHICH STOOD BY HIS BEDSIDE
4407-13146-0011 MY UNCLE TOBY AFTER HE HAD TURNED THE ROUGH SIDE OUTWARDS PUT IT ON THIS DONE HE PROCEEDED NEXT TO HIS BREECHES AND HAVING BUTTONED THE WAIST BAND HE FORTHWITH BUCKLED ON HIS SWORD BELT AND HAD GOT HIS SWORD HALF WAY IN WHEN HE CONSIDERED HE SHOULD WANT SHAVING
4407-13146-0012 SO TOOK IT OFF IN ESSAYING TO PUT ON HIS REGIMENTAL COAT AND WAISTCOAT MY UNCLE TOBY FOUND THE SAME OBJECTION IN HIS WIG SO THAT WENT OFF TOO
4407-13146-0013 AS ALWAYS FALLS OUT WHEN A MAN IS IN THE MOST HASTE
4407-13146-0014 WHICH WAS HALF AN HOUR LATER THAN HIS USUAL TIME BEFORE MY UNCLE TOBY SALLIED OUT
4407-13146-0015 MY UNCLE TOBY HAD SCARCE TURNED THE CORNER OF HIS YEW HEDGE
4407-13146-0016 LET ME STOP AND GIVE YOU A PICTURE OF THE CORPORAL'S APPARATUS AND OF THE CORPORAL HIMSELF IN THE HEIGHT OF HIS ATTACK JUST AS IT STRUCK MY UNCLE TOBY AS HE TURNED TOWARDS THE SENTRY BOX WHERE THE CORPORAL WAS AT WORK FOR IN NATURE THERE IS NOT SUCH ANOTHER
4407-13146-0017 NOR CAN ANY COMBINATION OF ALL THAT IS GROTESQUE AND WHIMSICAL IN HER WORKS PRODUCE ITS EQUAL THE CORPORAL TREAD LIGHTLY ON HIS ASHES YE MEN OF GENIUS FOR HE WAS YOUR KINSMAN WEED HIS GRAVE CLEAN YE MEN OF GOODNESS FOR HE WAS YOUR BROTHER
4407-13146-0018 OH CORPORAL HAD I THEE BUT NOW NOW THAT I AM ABLE TO GIVE THEE A DINNER AND PROTECTION HOW WOULD I CHERISH THEE THOU SHOULD'ST WEAR THY MONTERO CAP EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY AND EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK
4407-13146-0019 BUT ALAS ALAS ALAS NOW THAT I CAN DO THIS IN SPITE OF THEIR REVERENCES THE OCCASION IS LOST FOR THOU ART GONE THY GENIUS FLED UP TO THE STARS FROM WHENCE IT CAME AND THAT WARM HEART OF THINE WITH ALL ITS GENEROUS AND OPEN VESSELS
4407-13146-0020 COMPRESSED INTO A CLOD OF THE VALLEY BUT WHAT
4407-13146-0021 DECORATED WITH THE MILITARY ENSIGNS OF THY MASTER THE FIRST THE FOREMOST OF CREATED BEINGS WHERE I SHALL SEE THEE FAITHFUL SERVANT LAYING HIS SWORD AND SCABBARD WITH A TREMBLING HAND ACROSS HIS COFFIN
4407-13146-0022 AND THEN RETURNING PALE AS ASHES TO THE DOOR TO TAKE HIS MOURNING HORSE BY THE BRIDLE TO FOLLOW HIS HEARSE AS HE DIRECTED THEE WHERE
4407-13146-0023 I SHALL BEHOLD HIM AS HE INSPECTS THE LACKERED PLATE
4407-13146-0024 TO WIPE AWAY THE DEW WHICH NATURE HAS SHED UPON THEM WHEN I SEE HIM CAST IN THE ROSEMARY WITH AN AIR OF DISCONSOLATION WHICH CRIES THROUGH MY EARS O TOBY IN WHAT CORNER OF THE WORLD SHALL I SEEK THY FELLOW
4407-13146-0025 WHEN I SHALL ARRIVE AT THIS DREADED PAGE DEAL NOT WITH ME THEN WITH A STINTED HAND
4407-13146-0026 THE CORPORAL WHO THE NIGHT BEFORE HAD RESOLVED IN HIS MIND TO SUPPLY THE GRAND DESIDERATUM OF KEEPING UP SOMETHING LIKE AN INCESSANT FIRING UPON THE ENEMY DURING THE HEAT OF THE ATTACK HAD NO FURTHER IDEA IN HIS FANCY AT THAT TIME
4407-13146-0027 THAN A CONTRIVANCE OF SMOKING TOBACCO AGAINST THE TOWN OUT OF ONE OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S SIX FIELD PIECES WHICH WERE PLANTED ON EACH SIDE OF HIS SENTRY BOX THE MEANS OF EFFECTING WHICH OCCURRING TO HIS FANCY AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH HE HAD PLEDGED HIS CAP
4407-13146-0028 HE THOUGHT IT IN NO DANGER FROM THE MISCARRIAGE OF HIS PROJECTS UPON TURNING IT THIS WAY AND THAT A LITTLE IN HIS MIND HE SOON BEGAN TO FIND OUT THAT BY MEANS OF HIS TWO TURKISH TOBACCO PIPES
4407-13146-0029 WITH THE SUPPLEMENT OF THREE SMALLER TUBES OF WASH LEATHER AT EACH OF THEIR LOWER ENDS TO BE TAGG'D BY THE SAME NUMBER OF TIN PIPES FITTED TO THE TOUCH HOLES AND SEALED WITH CLAY NEXT THE CANNON
4407-13146-0030 AND THEN TIED HERMETICALLY WITH WAXED SILK AT THEIR SEVERAL INSERTIONS INTO THE MOROCCO TUBE HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIRE THE SIX FIELD PIECES ALL TOGETHER AND WITH THE SAME EASE AS TO FIRE ONE
4407-13146-0031 LET NO MAN WHO HAS READ MY FATHER'S FIRST AND SECOND BEDS OF JUSTICE EVER RISE UP AND SAY AGAIN FROM COLLISION OF WHAT KINDS OF BODIES LIGHT MAY OR MAY NOT BE STRUCK OUT TO CARRY THE ARTS AND SCIENCES UP TO PERFECTION HEAVEN THOU KNOWEST HOW I LOVE THEM
4407-13146-0032 THOU KNOWEST THE SECRETS OF MY HEART AND THAT I WOULD THIS MOMENT GIVE MY SHIRT THOU ART A FOOL SHANDY SAYS EUGENIUS
4407-13146-0033 AND TWILL BREAK THY SET NO MATTER FOR THAT EUGENIUS
4407-13146-0034 WERE IT ONLY TO SATISFY ONE FEVERISH ENQUIRER HOW MANY SPARKS AT ONE GOOD STROKE A GOOD FLINT AND STEEL COULD STRIKE INTO THE TAIL OF IT THINK YE NOT THAT IN STRIKING THESE IN HE MIGHT PER ADVENTURE STRIKE SOMETHING OUT AS SURE AS A GUN
4407-13146-0035 BUT THIS PROJECT BY THE BYE THE CORPORAL SAT UP THE BEST PART OF THE NIGHT IN BRINGING HIS TO PERFECTION AND HAVING MADE A SUFFICIENT PROOF OF HIS CANNON WITH CHARGING THEM TO THE TOP WITH TOBACCO HE WENT WITH CONTENTMENT TO BED
4407-13146-0036 IN ORDER TO FIX HIS APPARATUS AND JUST GIVE THE ENEMY A SHOT OR TWO BEFORE MY UNCLE TOBY CAME HE HAD DRAWN THE SIX FIELD PIECES FOR THIS END ALL CLOSE UP TOGETHER IN FRONT OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S SENTRY BOX
4407-13146-0037 WHICH HE MIGHT THINK DOUBLE THE HONOUR OF ONE IN THE REAR AND FACING THIS OPENING WITH HIS BACK TO THE DOOR OF THE SENTRY BOX FOR FEAR OF BEING FLANKED HAD THE CORPORAL WISELY TAKEN HIS POST HE HELD THE IVORY PIPE APPERTAINING TO THE BATTERY ON THE RIGHT
4407-13146-0038 BETWIXT THE FINGER AND THUMB OF HIS RIGHT HAND AND THE EBONY PIPE TIPP'D WITH SILVER WHICH APPERTAINED TO THE BATTERY ON THE LEFT BETWIXT THE FINGER AND THUMB OF THE OTHER AND WITH HIS RIGHT KNEE FIXED FIRM UPON THE GROUND AS IF IN THE FRONT RANK OF HIS PLATOON WAS THE CORPORAL
4407-13146-0039 WITH HIS MONTERO CAP UPON HIS HEAD FURIOUSLY PLAYING OFF HIS TWO CROSS BATTERIES AT THE SAME TIME AGAINST THE COUNTER GUARD WHICH FACED THE COUNTERSCARP
4407-13146-0040 HIS FIRST INTENTION AS I SAID WAS NO MORE THAN GIVING THE ENEMY A SINGLE PUFF OR TWO BUT THE PLEASURE OF THE PUFFS AS WELL AS THE PUFFING HAD INSENSIBLY GOT HOLD OF THE CORPORAL AND DRAWN HIM ON FROM PUFF TO PUFF INTO THE VERY HEIGHT OF THE ATTACK BY THE TIME MY UNCLE TOBY JOINED HIM
