3554-163609-0000 NEVER WAS THERE A BEAUTIFUL SOUL IN SUCH A FRIGHTFUL LITTLE BODY BUT IN SPITE OF HIS APPEARANCE EVERYBODY LOVED HIM THE QUEEN HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM CURLICUE BECAUSE IT WAS A NAME SHE RATHER LIKED AND IT SEEMED TO SUIT HIM KING GRUMPY WHO CARED A GREAT DEAL MORE FOR HIS OWN GRANDEUR THAN FOR HIS SON'S HAPPINESS
3554-163609-0001 WHOSE GREAT ESTATES JOINED HIS OWN FOR HE THOUGHT THAT THIS ALLIANCE WOULD MAKE HIM MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER AND AS FOR THE PRINCESS SHE WOULD DO VERY WELL FOR PRINCE CURLICUE FOR SHE WAS AS UGLY AS HIMSELF INDEED THOUGH SHE WAS THE MOST AMIABLE CREATURE IN THE WORLD
3554-163609-0002 THERE WAS NO CONCEALING THE FACT THAT SHE WAS FRIGHTFUL AND SO LAME THAT SHE ALWAYS WENT ABOUT WITH A CRUTCH AND PEOPLE CALLED HER PRINCESS CABBAGE STALK THE KING HAVING ASKED FOR AND RECEIVED A PORTRAIT OF THIS PRINCESS HAD IT PLACED IN HIS GREAT HALL UNDER A CANOPY AND SENT FOR PRINCE CURLICUE
3554-163609-0003 TO WHOM HE SAID THAT AS THIS WAS THE PORTRAIT OF HIS FUTURE BRIDE HE HOPED THE PRINCE FOUND IT CHARMING THE PRINCE AFTER ONE GLANCE AT IT TURNED AWAY WITH A DISDAINFUL AIR WHICH GREATLY OFFENDED HIS FATHER AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE NOT PLEASED HE SAID VERY SHARPLY
3554-163609-0004 CERTAINLY IT IS BECOMING IN YOU TO OBJECT TO THAT SAID KING GRUMPY SINCE YOU ARE UGLY ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN ANYONE YOURSELF THAT IS THE VERY REASON SAID THE PRINCE THAT I WISH TO MARRY SOMEONE WHO IS NOT UGLY I AM QUITE TIRED ENOUGH OF SEEING MYSELF I TELL YOU THAT YOU SHALL MARRY HER
3554-163609-0005 CRIED KING GRUMPY ANGRILY AND THE PRINCE SEEING THAT IT WAS OF NO USE TO REMONSTRATE BOWED AND RETIRED AS KING GRUMPY WAS NOT USED TO BEING CONTRADICTED IN ANYTHING HE WAS VERY MUCH DISPLEASED WITH HIS SON
3554-163609-0006 AND ORDERED THAT HE SHOULD BE IMPRISONED IN THE TOWER THAT WAS KEPT ON PURPOSE FOR REBELLIOUS PRINCES BUT HAD NOT BEEN USED FOR ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YEARS BECAUSE THERE HAD NOT BEEN ANY THE PRINCE THOUGHT ALL THE ROOMS LOOKED STRANGELY OLD FASHIONED WITH THEIR ANTIQUE FURNITURE BUT AS THERE WAS A GOOD LIBRARY HE WAS PLEASED
3554-163609-0007 FOR HE WAS VERY FOND OF READING AND HE SOON GOT PERMISSION TO HAVE AS MANY BOOKS AS HE LIKED
3554-163609-0008 WOULD SOON GET TIRED OF BEING IN PRISON AND SO CONSENT TO MARRY THE PRINCESS CABBAGE STALK THAT HE SENT AMBASSADORS TO HER FATHER PROPOSING THAT SHE SHOULD COME AND BE MARRIED TO HIS SON WHO WOULD MAKE HER PERFECTLY HAPPY THE KING WAS DELIGHTED TO RECEIVE SO GOOD AN OFFER FOR HIS UNLUCKY DAUGHTER
3554-163609-0009 THOUGH TO TELL THE TRUTH HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ADMIRE THE PRINCE'S PORTRAIT WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM HOWEVER HE HAD IT PLACED IN AS FAVOURABLE A LIGHT AS POSSIBLE AND SENT FOR THE PRINCESS BUT THE MOMENT SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF IT SHE LOOKED THE OTHER WAY AND BEGAN TO CRY
3554-163609-0010 THE KING WHO WAS VERY MUCH ANNOYED TO SEE HOW GREATLY SHE DISLIKED IT TOOK A MIRROR AND HOLDING IT UP BEFORE THE UNHAPPY PRINCESS SAID I SEE YOU DO NOT THINK THE PRINCE HANDSOME BUT LOOK AT YOURSELF AND SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY RIGHT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT SIRE SHE ANSWERED
3554-163609-0011 I DO NOT WISH TO COMPLAIN ONLY I BEG OF YOU DO NOT MAKE ME MARRY AT ALL I HAD RATHER BE THE UNHAPPY PRINCESS CABBAGE STALK ALL MY LIFE THAN INFLICT THE SIGHT OF MY UGLINESS ON ANYONE ELSE
3554-163609-0012 BUT ALL THE PRINCESS GUARDS WERE SO FOND OF HIM THAT THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY DARED IN SPITE OF THE KING TO MAKE THE TIME PASS PLEASANTLY
3554-163609-0013 AND TO BE FORCED TO MARRY AN EQUALLY FRIGHTFUL PRINCESS HE LOOKED UP SUDDENLY AND NOTICED THAT THE PAINTED WINDOWS WERE PARTICULARLY BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AND FOR THE SAKE OF DOING SOMETHING THAT WOULD CHANGE HIS SAD THOUGHTS HE BEGAN TO EXAMINE THEM ATTENTIVELY
3554-163609-0014 HE FOUND THAT THE PICTURES SEEMED TO BE SCENES FROM THE LIFE OF A MAN WHO APPEARED IN EVERY WINDOW AND THE PRINCE FANCYING THAT HE SAW IN THIS MAN SOME RESEMBLANCE TO HIMSELF BEGAN TO BE DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE FIRST WINDOW THERE WAS A PICTURE OF HIM IN ONE OF THE TURRETS OF THE TOWER
3554-163609-0015 FARTHER ON HE WAS SEEKING SOMETHING IN A CHINK IN THE WALL IN THE NEXT PICTURE HE WAS OPENING AN OLD CABINET WITH A GOLDEN KEY AND SO IT WENT ON THROUGH NUMBERS OF SCENES AND PRESENTLY THE PRINCE NOTICED THAT ANOTHER FIGURE OCCUPIED THE MOST IMPORTANT PLACE IN EACH SCENE
3554-163609-0016 AND THIS TIME IT WAS A TALL HANDSOME YOUNG MAN POOR PRINCE CURLICUE FOUND IT A PLEASURE TO LOOK AT HIM HE WAS SO STRAIGHT AND STRONG BY THIS TIME IT HAD GROWN DARK AND THE PRINCE HAD TO GO BACK TO HIS OWN ROOM AND TO AMUSE HIMSELF HE TOOK UP A QUAINT OLD BOOK
3554-163609-0017 AND BEGAN TO LOOK AT THE PICTURES BUT HIS SURPRISE WAS GREAT TO FIND THAT THEY REPRESENTED THE SAME SCENES AS THE WINDOWS OF THE GALLERY AND WHAT WAS MORE THAT THEY SEEMED TO BE ALIVE IN LOOKING AT PICTURES OF MUSICIANS HE SAW THEIR HANDS MOVE AND HEARD SWEET SOUNDS
3554-163609-0018 THERE WAS A PICTURE OF A BALL AND THE PRINCE COULD WATCH THE LITTLE DANCING PEOPLE COME AND GO HE TURNED A PAGE AND THERE WAS AN EXCELLENT SMELL OF A SAVOURY DINNER AND ONE OF THE FIGURES WHO SAT AT THE FEAST LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID WE DRINK YOUR HEALTH CURLICUE
3554-163609-0019 TRY TO GIVE US OUR QUEEN AGAIN FOR IF YOU DO YOU WILL BE REWARDED IF NOT IT WILL BE THE WORSE FOR YOU AT THESE WORDS THE PRINCE WHO HAD BEEN GROWING MORE AND MORE ASTONISHED WAS FAIRLY TERRIFIED AND DROPPING THE BOOK WITH A CRASH HE SANK BACK INSENSIBLE
3554-163609-0020 THE NOISE HE MADE BROUGHT HIS GUARDS TO HIS AID AND AS SOON AS HE REVIVED THEY ASKED HIM WHAT WAS THE MATTER HE ANSWERED THAT HE WAS SO FAINT AND GIDDY WITH HUNGER THAT HE HAD IMAGINED HE SAW AND HEARD ALL SORTS OF STRANGE THINGS THEREUPON IN SPITE OF THE KING'S ORDERS THE GUARDS GAVE HIM AN EXCELLENT SUPPER
3554-163609-0021 AND WHEN HE HAD EATEN IT HE AGAIN OPENED HIS BOOK BUT COULD SEE NONE OF THE WONDERFUL PICTURES WHICH CONVINCED HIM THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN DREAMING BEFORE HOWEVER
3554-163609-0022 AND LOOKED AT THE PAINTED WINDOWS AGAIN HE FOUND THAT THEY MOVED AND THE FIGURES CAME AND WENT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ALIVE AND AFTER WATCHING THE ONE WHO WAS LIKE HIMSELF FIND THE KEY IN THE CRACK OF THE TURRET WALL AND OPEN THE OLD CABINET HE DETERMINED TO GO AND EXAMINE THE PLACE HIMSELF
3554-163609-0023 AND TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT THE MYSTERY WAS SO HE WENT UP INTO THE TURRET AND BEGAN TO SEARCH ABOUT AND TAP UPON THE WALLS AND ALL AT ONCE HE CAME UPON A PLACE THAT SOUNDED HOLLOW TAKING A HAMMER HE BROKE AWAY A BIT OF THE STONE AND FOUND BEHIND IT A LITTLE GOLDEN KEY
3554-163609-0024 THE NEXT THING TO DO WAS TO FIND THE CABINET AND THE PRINCE SOON CAME TO IT HIDDEN AWAY IN A DARK CORNER THOUGH INDEED IT WAS SO OLD AND BATTERED LOOKING THAT HE WOULD NEVER HAVE NOTICED IT OF HIS OWN ACCORD AT FIRST HE COULD NOT SEE ANY KEYHOLE BUT AFTER A CAREFUL SEARCH HE FOUND ONE HIDDEN IN THE CARVING
3554-163609-0025 AND THE GOLDEN KEY JUST FITTED IT SO THE PRINCE GAVE IT A VIGOROUS TURN AND THE DOORS FLEW OPEN UGLY AND OLD AS THE CABINET WAS OUTSIDE NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN MORE RICH AND BEAUTIFUL THAN WHAT MET THE PRINCE'S ASTONISHED EYES EVERY DRAWER WAS MADE OF CRYSTAL
3554-163609-0026 OF AMBER OR OF SOME PRECIOUS STONE AND WAS QUITE FULL OF EVERY KIND OF TREASURE PRINCE CURLICUE WAS DELIGHTED HE OPENED ONE AFTER ANOTHER
3554-163609-0027 I BELIEVE THAT THIS MUST OPEN THAT LITTLE GOLDEN DOOR IN THE MIDDLE SAID THE PRINCE TO HIMSELF AND HE FITTED IN THE LITTLE KEY AND TURNED IT THE TINY DOOR SWUNG BACK AND A SOFT CRIMSON LIGHT GLEAMED OVER THE WHOLE CABINET
3554-163609-0028 THE PRINCE FOUND THAT IT PROCEEDED FROM AN IMMENSE GLOWING CARBUNCLE MADE INTO A BOX WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM HE LOST NO TIME IN OPENING IT BUT WHAT WAS HIS HORROR WHEN HE FOUND THAT IT CONTAINED A MAN'S HAND WHICH WAS HOLDING A PORTRAIT
3554-163609-0029 HIS FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO PUT BACK THE TERRIBLE BOX AND FLY FROM THE TURRET BUT A VOICE IN HIS EAR SAID THIS HAND BELONGED TO ONE WHOM YOU CAN HELP AND RESTORE LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL PORTRAIT THE ORIGINAL OF WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF ALL MY MISFORTUNES
3554-163609-0030 AND IF YOU WISH TO HELP ME GO WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY TO THE GREAT GALLERY NOTICE WHERE THE SUN'S RAYS FALL MOST BRIGHTLY AND IF YOU SEEK THERE YOU WILL FIND MY TREASURE THE VOICE CEASED AND THOUGH THE PRINCE IN HIS BEWILDERMENT ASKED VARIOUS QUESTIONS HE RECEIVED NO ANSWER
3554-163609-0031 SO HE PUT BACK THE BOX AND LOCKED THE CABINET UP AGAIN AND HAVING REPLACED THE KEY IN THE CRACK IN THE WALL HASTENED DOWN TO THE GALLERY WHEN HE ENTERED IT ALL THE WINDOWS SHOOK AND CLATTERED IN THE STRANGEST WAY BUT THE PRINCE DID NOT HEED THEM
3554-163609-0032 HE WAS LOOKING SO CAREFULLY FOR THE PLACE WHERE THE SUN SHONE MOST BRIGHTLY AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT WAS UPON THE PORTRAIT OF A MOST SPLENDIDLY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN HE WENT UP AND EXAMINED IT AND FOUND THAT IT RESTED AGAINST THE EBONY AND GOLD PANELLING
3554-163609-0033 JUST LIKE ANY OF THE OTHER PICTURES IN THE GALLERY HE WAS PUZZLED NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO NEXT UNTIL IT OCCURRED TO HIM TO SEE IF THE WINDOWS WOULD HELP HIM AND LOOKING AT THE NEAREST HE SAW A PICTURE OF HIMSELF LIFTING THE PICTURE FROM THE WALL
3554-163609-0034 THE PRINCE TOOK THE HINT AND LIFTING ASIDE THE PICTURE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY FOUND HIMSELF IN A MARBLE HALL ADORNED WITH STATUES FROM THIS HE PASSED ON THROUGH NUMBERS OF SPLENDID ROOMS UNTIL AT LAST HE REACHED ONE ALL HUNG WITH BLUE GAUZE
3554-163609-0035 THE WALLS WERE OF TURQUOISES AND UPON A LOW COUCH LAY A LOVELY LADY WHO SEEMED TO BE ASLEEP HER HAIR BLACK AS EBONY WAS SPREAD ACROSS THE PILLOWS MAKING HER FACE LOOK IVORY WHITE AND THE PRINCE NOTICED THAT SHE WAS UNQUIET
3554-163609-0036 AND WHEN HE SOFTLY ADVANCED FEARING TO WAKE HER HE COULD HEAR HER SIGH AND MURMUR TO HERSELF AH HOW DARED YOU THINK TO WIN MY LOVE BY SEPARATING ME FROM MY BELOVED FLORIMOND
3554-163609-0037 AND PRINCE CURLICUE BEGAN TO COMPREHEND THAT SHE WAS UNDER AN ENCHANTMENT AND THAT IT WAS THE HAND OF HER LOVER THAT HE HAD FOUND AT THIS MOMENT A HUGE EAGLE FLEW INTO THE ROOM HOLDING IN ITS TALONS A GOLDEN BRANCH UPON WHICH WERE GROWING WHAT LOOKED LIKE CLUSTERS OF CHERRIES
3554-163609-0038 ONLY EVERY CHERRY WAS A SINGLE GLOWING RUBY THIS HE PRESENTED TO THE PRINCE WHO GUESSED BY THIS TIME THAT HE WAS IN SOME WAY TO BREAK THE ENCHANTMENT THAT SURROUNDED THE SLEEPING LADY TAKING THE BRANCH HE TOUCHED HER LIGHTLY WITH IT SAYING FAIR ONE I KNOW NOT BY WHAT ENCHANTMENT THOU ART BOUND
3554-163609-0039 BUT IN THE NAME OF THY BELOVED FLORIMOND I CONJURE THEE TO COME BACK TO THE LIFE WHICH THOU HAST LOST BUT NOT FORGOTTEN INSTANTLY THE LADY OPENED HER LUSTROUS EYES AND SAW THE EAGLE HOVERING NEAR AH STAY DEAR LOVE STAY SHE CRIED
3554-163609-0040 BUT THE EAGLE UTTERING A DOLOROUS CRY FLUTTERED HIS BROAD WINGS AND DISAPPEARED THEN THE LADY TURNED TO PRINCE CURLICUE AND SAID
3554-163609-0041 MADAM SAID PRINCE CURLICUE I WISH TO BE ALLOWED TO RESTORE YOUR BELOVED FLORIMOND TO HIS NATURAL FORM SINCE I CANNOT FORGET THE TEARS YOU SHED FOR HIM THAT IS VERY AMIABLE OF YOU DEAR PRINCE SAID THE FAIRY BUT IT IS RESERVED FOR ANOTHER PERSON TO DO THAT
3554-163609-0042 I CANNOT EXPLAIN MORE AT PRESENT BUT IS THERE NOTHING YOU WISH FOR YOURSELF MADAM CRIED THE PRINCE FLINGING HIMSELF DOWN AT HER FEET ONLY LOOK AT MY UGLINESS I AM CALLED CURLICUE AND AM AN OBJECT OF DERISION I ENTREAT YOU TO MAKE ME LESS RIDICULOUS
