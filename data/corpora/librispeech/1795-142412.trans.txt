1795-142412-0000 A FALLING OUT HAROLD TOLD ME THE MAIN FACTS OF THIS EPISODE SOME TIME LATER IN BITS AND WITH RELUCTANCE IT WAS NOT A RECOLLECTION HE CARED TO TALK ABOUT THE CRUDE BLANK MISERY OF A MOMENT
1795-142412-0001 IS APT TO LEAVE A DULL BRUISE WHICH IS SLOW TO DEPART IF IT EVER DOES SO ENTIRELY AND HAROLD CONFESSES TO A TWINGE OR TWO STILL AT TIMES LIKE THE VETERAN WHO BRINGS HOME A BULLET INSIDE HIM FROM MARTIAL PLAINS OVER SEA
1795-142412-0002 HE KNEW HE WAS A BRUTE THE MOMENT HE HAD DONE IT SELINA HAD NOT MEANT TO WORRY ONLY TO COMFORT AND ASSIST BUT HIS SOUL WAS ONE RAW SORE WITHIN HIM
1795-142412-0003 WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF SHUT UP IN THE SCHOOLROOM AFTER HOURS MERELY FOR INSISTING THAT SEVEN TIMES SEVEN AMOUNTED TO FORTY SEVEN THE INJUSTICE OF IT SEEMED SO FLAGRANT WHY NOT FORTY SEVEN AS MUCH AS FORTY NINE ONE NUMBER WAS NO PRETTIER THAN THE OTHER TO LOOK AT
1795-142412-0004 AND IT WAS EVIDENTLY ONLY A MATTER OF ARBITRARY TASTE AND PREFERENCE AND ANYHOW IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN FORTY SEVEN TO HIM AND WOULD BE TO THE END OF TIME SO WHEN SELINA CAME IN OUT OF THE SUN LEAVING THE TRAPPERS OR THE FAR WEST BEHIND HER
1795-142412-0005 AND PUTTING OFF THE GLORY OF BEING AN APACHE SQUAW IN ORDER TO HEAR HIM HIS TABLES AND WIN HIS RELEASE HAROLD TURNED ON HER VENOMOUSLY REJECTED HER KINDLY OVERTURES
1795-142412-0006 THE FIT PASSED DIRECTLY HIS EYES WERE OPENED AND HIS SOUL SAT IN THE DUST AS HE SORROWFULLY BEGAN TO CAST ABOUT FOR SOME ATONEMENT HEROIC ENOUGH TO SALVE THE WRONG OF COURSE POOR SELINA LOOKED FOR NO SACRIFICE NOR HEROICS WHATEVER
1795-142412-0007 SHE DIDN'T EVEN WANT HIM TO SAY HE WAS SORRY IF HE WOULD ONLY MAKE IT UP SHE WOULD HAVE DONE THE APOLOGISING PART HERSELF BUT THAT WAS NOT A BOY'S WAY SOMETHING SOLID HAROLD FELT WAS DUE FROM HIM AND UNTIL THAT WAS ACHIEVED
1795-142412-0008 MAKING UP MUST NOT BE THOUGHT OF IN ORDER THAT THE FINAL EFFECT MIGHT NOT BE SPOILT ACCORDINGLY WHEN HIS RELEASE CAME AND POOR SELINA HUNG ABOUT TRYING TO CATCH HIS EYE HAROLD POSSESSED BY THE DEMON OF A DISTORTED MOTIVE AVOIDED HER STEADILY
1795-142412-0009 THOUGH HE WAS BLEEDING INWARDLY AT EVERY MINUTE OF DELAY AND CAME TO ME INSTEAD NEEDLESS TO SAY I APPROVED HIS PLAN HIGHLY IT WAS SO MUCH MORE HIGH TONED THAN JUST GOING AND MAKING UP TAMELY WHICH ANY ONE COULD DO
1795-142412-0010 AND A GIRL WHO HAD BEEN JOBBED IN THE RIBS BY A HOSTILE ELBOW COULD NOT BE EXPECTED FOR A MOMENT TO OVERLOOK IT WITHOUT THE LINIMENT OF AN OFFERING TO SOOTHE HER INJURED FEELINGS I KNOW WHAT SHE WANTS MOST SAID HAROLD SHE WANTS THAT SET OF TEA THINGS IN THE TOY SHOP WINDOW
1795-142412-0011 WITH THE RED AND BLUE FLOWERS ON EM SHE'S WANTED IT FOR MONTHS COS HER DOLLS ARE GETTING BIG ENOUGH TO HAVE REAL AFTERNOON TEA AND SHE WANTS IT SO BADLY THAT SHE WON'T WALK THAT SIDE OF THE STREET WHEN WE GO INTO THE TOWN BUT IT COSTS FIVE SHILLINGS
1795-142412-0012 THEN WE SET TO WORK SERIOUSLY AND DEVOTED THE AFTERNOON TO A REALISATION OF ASSETS AND THE COMPOSITION OF A BUDGET THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DATED WITHOUT SHAME FROM WHITEHALL
1795-142412-0013 TURNED UP AT LAST IN THE STRAW OF THE DOG KENNEL
1795-142412-0014 TWO SIX BY ADVANCE FROM ME ON SECURITY OF NEXT UNCLE AND FAILING THAT TO BE CALLED IN AT CHRISTMAS
1795-142412-0015 BY SHAKEN OUT OF MISSIONARY BOX WITH THE HELP OF A KNIFE BLADE
1795-142412-0016 BY BET DUE FROM EDWARD FOR WALKING ACROSS THE FIELD WHERE FARMER LARKIN'S BULL WAS AND EDWARD BET HIM TWOPENCE HE WOULDN'T
1795-142412-0017 BY ADVANCE FROM MARTHA ON NO SECURITY AT ALL ONLY YOU MUSTN'T TELL YOUR AUNT
1795-142412-0018 AND AT LAST WE BREATHED AGAIN THE REST PROMISED TO BE EASY SELINA HAD A TEA PARTY AT FIVE ON THE MORROW WITH THE CHIPPED OLD WOODEN TEA THINGS THAT HAD SERVED HER SUCCESSIVE DOLLS FROM BABYHOOD HAROLD WOULD SLIP OFF DIRECTLY AFTER DINNER
1795-142412-0019 GOING ALONE SO AS NOT TO AROUSE SUSPICION AS WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GO INTO THE TOWN BY OURSELVES IT WAS NEARLY TWO MILES TO OUR SMALL METROPOLIS BUT THERE WOULD BE PLENTY OF TIME FOR HIM TO GO AND RETURN EVEN LADEN WITH THE OLIVE BRANCH NEATLY PACKED IN SHAVINGS
1795-142412-0020 BESIDES HE MIGHT MEET THE BUTCHER WHO WAS HIS FRIEND AND WOULD GIVE HIM A LIFT THEN FINALLY AT FIVE THE RAPTURE OF THE NEW TEA SERVICE DESCENDED FROM THE SKIES AND RETRIBUTION MADE MAKING UP AT LAST WITHOUT LOSS OF DIGNITY
1795-142412-0021 WITH THE EVENT BEFORE US WE THOUGHT IT A SMALL THING THAT TWENTY FOUR HOURS MORE OF ALIENATION AND PRETENDED SULKS MUST BE KEPT UP ON HAROLD'S PART BUT SELINA WHO NATURALLY KNEW NOTHING OF THE TREAT IN STORE FOR HER MOPED FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING AND TOOK A VERY HEAVY HEART TO BED
1795-142412-0022 WHEN NEXT DAY THE HOUR FOR ACTION ARRIVED HAROLD EVADED OLYMPIAN ATTENTION WITH AN EASY MODESTY BORN OF LONG PRACTICE AND MADE OFF FOR THE FRONT GATE SELINA WHO HAD BEEN KEEPING HER EYE UPON HIM THOUGHT HE WAS GOING DOWN TO THE POND TO CATCH FROGS
1795-142412-0023 A JOY THEY HAD PLANNED TO SHARE TOGETHER AND MADE AFTER HIM BUT HAROLD THOUGH HE HEARD HER FOOTSTEPS CONTINUED STERNLY ON HIS HIGH MISSION WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING BACK AND SELINA WAS LEFT TO WANDER DISCONSOLATELY AMONG FLOWER BEDS
1795-142412-0024 ALL SCENT AND COLOUR I SAW IT ALL AND ALTHOUGH COLD REASON APPROVED OUR LINE OF ACTION INSTINCT TOLD ME WE WERE BRUTES HAROLD REACHED THE TOWN SO HE RECOUNTED AFTERWARDS IN RECORD TIME
1795-142412-0025 HAVING RUN MOST OF THE WAY FOR FEAR THE TEA THINGS WHICH HAD REPOSED SIX MONTHS IN THE WINDOW SHOULD BE SNAPPED UP BY SOME OTHER CONSCIENCE STRICKEN LACERATOR OF A SISTER'S FEELINGS AND IT SEEMED HARDLY CREDIBLE TO FIND THEM STILL THERE AND THEIR OWNER WILLING TO PART WITH THEM FOR THE PRICE MARKED ON THE TICKET
1795-142412-0026 HE PAID HIS MONEY DOWN AT ONCE THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO DRAWING BACK FROM THE BARGAIN AND THEN AS THE THINGS HAD TO BE TAKEN OUT OF THE WINDOW AND PACKED AND THE AFTERNOON WAS YET YOUNG HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT TREAT HIMSELF TO A TASTE OF URBAN JOYS
1795-142412-0027 SHOPS CAME FIRST OF COURSE
1795-142412-0028 AND THE CLOCK WORK LOCOMOTIVE AND AGAINST THE BARBER'S WINDOW WITH WIGS ON BLOCKS REMINDING HIM OF UNCLES AND SHAVING CREAM THAT LOOKED SO GOOD TO EAT AND THE GROCER'S WINDOW DISPLAYING MORE CURRANTS THAN THE WHOLE BRITISH POPULATION COULD POSSIBLY CONSUME WITHOUT A SPECIAL EFFORT
1795-142412-0029 AND THE WINDOW OF THE BANK WHEREIN GOLD WAS THOUGHT SO LITTLE OF THAT IT WAS DEALT ABOUT IN SHOVELS NEXT THERE WAS THE MARKET PLACE WITH ALL ITS CLAMOROUS JOYS AND WHEN A RUNAWAY CALF CAME DOWN THE STREET LIKE A CANNON BALL HAROLD FELT THAT HE HAD NOT LIVED IN VAIN
1795-142412-0030 THE WHOLE PLACE WAS SO BRIMFUL OF EXCITEMENT THAT HE HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THE WHY AND THE WHEREFORE OF HIS BEING THERE WHEN A SIGHT OF THE CHURCH CLOCK RECALLED HIM TO HIS BETTER SELF AND SENT HIM FLYING OUT OF THE TOWN AS HE REALISED HE HAD ONLY JUST TIME ENOUGH LEFT TO GET BACK IN
1795-142412-0031 IF HE WERE AFTER HIS APPOINTED HOUR HE WOULD NOT ONLY MISS HIS HIGH TRIUMPH BUT PROBABLY WOULD BE DETECTED AS A TRANSGRESSOR OF BOUNDS A CRIME BEFORE WHICH A PRIVATE OPINION ON MULTIPLICATION SANK TO NOTHINGNESS SO HE JOGGED ALONG ON HIS HOMEWARD WAY
1795-142412-0032 THINKING OF MANY THINGS AND PROBABLY TALKING TO HIMSELF A GOOD DEAL AS HIS HABIT WAS AND HAD COVERED NEARLY HALF THE DISTANCE WHEN SUDDENLY A DEADLY SINKING IN THE PIT OF HIS STOMACH A PARALYSIS OF EVERY LIMB AROUND HIM A WORLD EXTINCT OF LIGHT AND MUSIC
1795-142412-0033 A BLACK SUN AND A REELING SKY HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE TEA THINGS IT WAS USELESS IT WAS HOPELESS ALL WAS OVER AND NOTHING COULD NOW BE DONE NEVERTHELESS HE TURNED AND RAN BACK WILDLY BLINDLY
1795-142412-0034 CHOKING WITH THE BIG SOBS THAT EVOKED NEITHER PITY NOR COMFORT FROM A MERCILESS MOCKING WORLD AROUND A STITCH IN HIS SIDE DUST IN HIS EYES AND BLACK DESPAIR CLUTCHING AT HIS HEART SO HE STUMBLED ON WITH LEADEN LEGS AND BURSTING SIDES TILL
1795-142412-0035 AS IF FATE HAD NOT YET DEALT HIM HER LAST WORST BUFFET ON TURNING A CORNER IN THE ROAD HE ALMOST RAN UNDER THE WHEELS OF A DOG CART IN WHICH AS IT PULLED UP WAS APPARENT THE PORTLY FORM OF FARMER LARKIN THE ARCH ENEMY WHOSE DUCKS HE HAD BEEN SHYING STONES AT THAT VERY MORNING
1795-142412-0036 HAD HAROLD BEEN IN HIS RIGHT AND UNCLOUDED SENSES HE WOULD HAVE VANISHED THROUGH THE HEDGE SOME SECONDS EARLIER RATHER THAN PAIN THE FARMER BY ANY UNPLEASANT REMINISCENCES WHICH HIS APPEARANCE MIGHT CALL UP BUT AS THINGS WERE HE COULD ONLY STAND AND BLUBBER HOPELESSLY
1795-142412-0037 CARING INDEED LITTLE NOW WHAT FURTHER ILL MIGHT BEFALL HIM THE FARMER FOR HIS PART SURVEYED THE DESOLATE FIGURE WITH SOME ASTONISHMENT CALLING OUT IN NO UNFRIENDLY ACCENTS WHY MASTER HAROLD WHATEVER BE THE MATTER
1795-142412-0038 BAINT RUNNIN AWAY BE EE THEN HAROLD WITH THE UNNATURAL COURAGE BORN OF DESPERATION FLUNG HIMSELF ON THE STEP AND CLIMBING INTO THE CART FELL IN THE STRAW AT THE BOTTOM OF IT SOBBING OUT THAT HE WANTED TO GO BACK GO BACK
1795-142412-0039 THE SITUATION HAD A VAGUENESS BUT THE FARMER A MAN OF ACTION RATHER THAN WORDS SWUNG HIS HORSE ROUND SMARTLY AND THEY WERE IN THE TOWN AGAIN BY THE TIME HAROLD HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF SUFFICIENTLY TO FURNISH SOME DETAILS AS THEY DROVE UP TO THE SHOP
1795-142412-0040 THE WOMAN WAS WAITING AT THE DOOR WITH THE PARCEL AND HARDLY A MINUTE SEEMED TO HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THE BLACK CRISIS ERE THEY WERE BOWLING ALONG SWIFTLY HOME THE PRECIOUS PARCEL HUGGED IN A CLOSE EMBRACE AND NOW THE FARMER CAME OUT IN QUITE A NEW AND UNEXPECTED LIGHT
1795-142412-0041 NEVER A WORD DID HE SAY OF BROKEN FENCES AND HURDLES OF TRAMPLED CROPS AND HARRIED FLOCKS AND HERDS ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE MAN HAD NEVER POSSESSED A HEAD OF LIVE STOCK IN HIS LIFE INSTEAD HE WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE WHOLE DOLOROUS QUEST OF THE TEA THINGS
1795-142412-0042 AND SYMPATHISED WITH HAROLD ON THE DISPUTED POINT IN MATHEMATICS AS IF HE HAD BEEN HIMSELF AT THE SAME STAGE OF EDUCATION AS THEY NEARED HOME HAROLD FOUND HIMSELF TO HIS SURPRISE SITTING UP AND CHATTING TO HIS NEW FRIEND LIKE MAN TO MAN
1795-142412-0043 AND BEFORE HE WAS DROPPED AT A CONVENIENT GAP IN THE GARDEN HEDGE HE HAD PROMISED THAT WHEN SELINA GAVE HER FIRST PUBLIC TEA PARTY LITTLE MISS LARKIN SHOULD BE INVITED TO COME AND BRING HA WHOLE SAWDUST FAMILY ALONG WITH HER
1795-142412-0044 AND THE FARMER APPEARED AS PLEASED AND PROUD AS IF HE HAT BEEN ASKED TO A GARDEN PARTY AT MARLBOROUGH HOUSE REALLY THOSE OLYMPIANS HAVE CERTAIN GOOD POINTS FAR DOWN IN THEM I SHALL HAVE TO LEAVE OFF ABUSING THEM SOME DAY AT THE HOUR OF FIVE SELINA
1795-142412-0045 HAVING SPENT THE AFTERNOON SEARCHING FOR HAROLD IN ALL HIS ACCUSTOMED HAUNTS SAT DOWN DISCONSOLATELY TO TEA WITH HER DOLLS WHO UNGENEROUSLY REFUSED TO WAIT BEYOND THE APPOINTED HOUR THE WOODEN TEA THINGS SEEMED MORE CHIPPED THAN USUAL
1795-142412-0046 AND THE DOLLS THEMSELVES HAD MORE OF WAX AND SAWDUST AND LESS OF HUMAN COLOUR AND INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THEM THAN SHE EVER REMEMBERED BEFORE
