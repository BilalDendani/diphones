3934-102415-0000 IN CAMP AUGUST THIRTY FIRST NINETEEN FOURTEEN DEAR MISSUS CONEY WE ARE ACROSS THE DESERT AND CAMPED FOR A FEW DAYS FISHING ON A SHADY BOWERY LITTLE STREAM
3934-102415-0001 WE HAVE HAD TWO FROSTY NIGHTS AND THERE ARE TREMBLING GOLDEN GROVES ON EVERY HAND FOUR MEN JOINED US AT NEWFORK AND THE BACHELORS HAVE GONE ON
3934-102415-0002 BUT MISTER STEWART WANTED TO REST THE BEASTIES AND WE ALL WANTED TO FISH SO WE CAMPED FOR A DAY OR TWO THE TWENTY EIGHTH WAS THE WARMEST DAY WE HAVE HAD THE MOST DISAGREEABLE IN EVERY WAY
3934-102415-0003 NOT A BREATH OF AIR STIRRED EXCEPT AN OCCASIONAL WHIRLWIND WHICH WAS HOT AND THREW SAND AND DUST OVER US WE COULD SEE THE HEAT GLIMMERING AND NOT A TREE NOR A GREEN SPOT THE MOUNTAINS LOOKED NO NEARER
3934-102415-0004 I AM AFRAID WE ALL RATHER WISHED WE WERE AT HOME
3934-102415-0005 WATER WAS GETTING VERY SCARCE SO THE MEN WANTED TO REACH BY NOON A LONG LOW VALLEY THEY KNEW OF FOR SOMETIMES WATER COULD BE FOUND IN A BURIED RIVER BED THERE AND THEY HOPED TO FIND ENOUGH FOR THE HORSES
3934-102415-0006 BUT A LITTLE AFTER NOON WE CAME TO THE SPOT AND ONLY DRY GLISTENING SAND MET OUR EYES THE MEN EMPTIED THE WATER BAGS FOR THE HORSES THEY ALL HAD A LITTLE WATER
3934-102415-0007 WE HAD TO BE SAVING SO NONE OF US WASHED OUR DUST GRIMED FACES WE WERE SITTING IN THE SCANT SHADOW OF THE WAGONS EATING OUR DINNER WHEN WE WERE STARTLED TO SEE A TALL BARE HEADED MAN
3934-102415-0008 COME RACING DOWN THE DRAW HIS CLOTHES AND SHOES WERE IN TATTERS THERE WERE GREAT BLISTERS ON HIS ARMS AND SHOULDERS WHERE THE SUN HAD BURNED HIM HIS EYES WERE SWOLLEN AND RED AND HIS LIPS WERE CRACKED AND BLOODY
3934-102415-0009 HIS HAIR WAS SO WHITE AND SO DUSTY THAT ALTOGETHER HE WAS A PITIFUL LOOKING OBJECT HE GREETED US PLEASANTLY AND SAID THAT HIS NAME WAS OLAF SWANSON AND THAT HE WAS A SHEEP HERDER THAT HE HAD SEEN US AND HAD COME TO ASK FOR A LITTLE SMOKING
3934-102415-0010 BY THAT HE MEANT TOBACCO MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY WAS EYEING HIM VERY CLOSELY SHE ASKED HIM WHEN HE HAD EATEN THAT MORNING HE SAID SHE ASKED HIM WHAT HE HAD EATEN
3934-102415-0011 HE TOLD HER CACTUS BALLS AND A LITTLE RABBIT I SAW HER EXCHANGE GLANCES WITH PROFESSOR GLENHOLDT AND SHE LEFT HER DINNER TO GET OUT HER WAR BAG SHE CALLED OLAF ASIDE AND GENTLY DRESSED HIS BLISTERS WITH LISTERINE
3934-102415-0012 AFTER SHE HAD HELPED HIM TO CLEAN HIS MOUTH SHE SAID TO HIM NOW OLAF SIT BY ME AND EAT SHOW ME HOW MUCH YOU CAN EAT THEN TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU ARE A SHEEP HERDER
3934-102415-0013 DON'T YOU THINK WE KNOW THERE WILL BE NO SHEEP ON THE DESERT BEFORE THERE IS SNOW TO MAKE WATER FOR THEM I AM WHAT I SAY I AM HE SAID I AM NOT HERDING NOW BECAUSE SORROW HAS DROVE ME TO DIG WELLS
3934-102415-0014 IT IS SORROW FOR HORSES HAVE YOU NOT SEEN THEIR BONES EVERY MILE OR SO ALONG THIS ROAD THEM'S MARKERS EVERY PILE OF BONES MARKS WHERE MAN'S MOST FAITHFUL FRIEND HAS LAID DOWN AT LAST
3934-102415-0015 MOST OF EM DIED IN THE HARNESS AND FOR WANT OF WATER I KILLED A HORSE ONCE I WAS TRYING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME I HAD BEEN OUT WITH SHEEP FOR MONTHS AND HADN'T SEEN ANY ONE BUT MY PARDNER
3934-102415-0016 WE PLANNED TO HAVE A RIPPIN GOOD TIME WHEN WE TOOK THE SHEEP IN OFF THE SUMMER RANGE AND DREW OUR PAY YOU DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE HUNGRY A MAN GETS LIVIN OUT SO MY PARDNER AND ME LAYED OUT TO HAVE ONE SPREE
3934-102415-0017 WE HAD A NEAT LITTLE BUNCH OF MONEY BUT WHEN WE GOT TO TOWN WE FELT LOST AS SHEEP WE DIDN'T KNOW NOBODY BUT THE BARTENDER WE KEPT TAKING A DRINK NOW AND THEN JUST SO AS TO HAVE HIM TO TALK TO
3934-102415-0018 FINALLY HE TOLD US THERE WAS GOING TO BE A DANCE THAT NIGHT SO WE ASKED AROUND AND FOUND WE COULD GET TICKETS FOR TWO DOLLARS EACH SAM SAID HE'D LIKE TO GO WE BOUGHT TICKETS
3934-102415-0019 SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER THEY KNEW US FOR SHEEP HERDERS AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE SOMEBODY WOULD BAA BAA AT US WE HAD A COUPLE OF DANCES BUT AFTER THAT WE COULDN'T GET A PARDNER
3934-102415-0020 AFTER MIDNIGHT THINGS BEGUN TO GET PRETTY NOISY SAM AND ME WAS SETTIN WONDERIN IF WE WERE HAVIN A GOOD TIME WHEN A FELLOW STEPPED ON SAM'S FOOT AND SAID BAA
3934-102415-0021 I ROSE UP AND WAS GOIN TO SMASH HIM BUT SAM COLLARED ME AND SAID LET'S GET AWAY FROM HERE OLAF BEFORE TROUBLE BREAKS OUT
3934-102415-0022 WE WERE PRETTY NEAR THE DOOR WHEN A MAN PUT HIS HAND TO HIS NOSE AND BAA ED I KNOCKED HIM DOWN AND BEFORE YOU COULD BAT YOUR EYE EVERYBODY WAS FIGHTIN WE COULDN'T GET OUT SO WE BACKED INTO A CORNER
3934-102415-0023 AND EVERY MAN MY FIST HIT RESTED ON THE FLOOR TILL SOMEBODY HELPED HIM AWAY
3934-102415-0024 WE WERE AWAY OUT ON THE DESERT NOT FAR FROM NORTH PILOT BUTTE POOR SAM COULDN'T SPEAK I GOT HIM OFF POOR OLD PINTO AND TOOK OFF THE SADDLE FOR A PILLOW FOR HIM I HUNG THE SADDLE BLANKET ON A GREASEWOOD
3934-102415-0025 SO AS TO SHADE HIS FACE THEN I GOT ON MY OWN POOR HORSE POOR OLD BILLY AND STARTED TO HUNT HELP I RODE AND RODE I WAS TRYIN TO FIND SOME OUTFIT
3934-102415-0026 WHEN BILLY LAGGED I BEAT HIM ON YOU SEE I WAS THINKING OF SAM
3934-102415-0027 STEPPED INTO A BADGER HOLE I THOUGHT BUT HE KEPT STAGGERIN I FELL OFF ON ONE SIDE JUST AS HE PITCHED FORWARD HE TRIED AND TRIED TO GET UP I STAYED TILL HE DIED THEN I KEPT WALKING
3934-102415-0028 I DON'T KNOW WHAT BECAME OF SAM I DON'T KNOW WHAT BECAME OF ME BUT I DO KNOW I AM GOING TO DIG WELLS ALL OVER THIS DESERT UNTIL EVERY THIRSTY HORSE CAN HAVE WATER ALL THE TIME HE HAD BEEN EATING JUST PICKLES
3934-102415-0029 WHEN HE FINISHED HIS STORY HE ATE FASTER BY NOW WE ALL KNEW HE WAS DEMENTED THE MEN TRIED TO COAX HIM TO GO ON WITH US SO THAT THEY COULD TURN HIM OVER TO THE AUTHORITIES BUT HE SAID HE MUST BE DIGGING
3934-102415-0030 AT LAST IT WAS DECIDED TO SEND SOME ONE BACK FOR HIM MISTER STRUBLE WAS UNWILLING TO LEAVE HIM BUT THE MAN WOULD NOT BE PERSUADED SUDDENLY HE GATHERED UP HIS SMOKING AND SOME FOOD
3934-102415-0031 AND RAN BACK UP THE DRAW WE HAD TO GO ON OF COURSE ALL THAT AFTERNOON OUR ROAD LAY ALONG THE BURIED RIVER I DON'T MEAN DRY RIVER
3934-102415-0032 SAND HAD BLOWN INTO THE RIVER UNTIL THE WATER WAS BURIED WATER WAS ONLY A FEW FEET DOWN AND THE BANKS WERE CLEARLY DEFINED SOMETIMES WE CAME TO A SMALL DIRTY PUDDLE BUT IT WAS SO ALKALINE THAT NOTHING COULD DRINK IT
3934-102415-0033 THE STORY WE HAD HEARD HAD SADDENED US ALL AND WE WERE SORRY FOR OUR HORSES POOR LITTLE ELIZABETH HULL WEPT SHE SAID THE WEST WAS SO BIG AND BARE AND SHE WAS SO ALONE AND SO SAD SHE JUST HAD TO CRY
3934-102415-0034 ABOUT SUNDOWN WE CAME TO A RANCH AND WERE MADE WELCOME BY ONE TIMOTHY HOBBS OWNER OF THE PLACE THE DWELLING AND THE STABLES WERE A COLLECTION OF LOW BROWN HOUSES MADE OF LOGS AND DAUBED WITH MUD
3934-102415-0035 FIELDS OF SHOCKED GRAIN MADE A VERY PROSPEROUS LOOKING BACKGROUND A BELLED COW LED A BUNCH OF SLEEK CATTLE HOME OVER THE SAND DUNES
3934-102415-0036 THE CATTLE CAME AND DRANK AT THE TROUGH THE BELL MAKING A PLEASANT SOUND IN THE TWILIGHT THE MEN TOLD MISTER HOBBS ABOUT THE MAN WE SAW OH YES HE SAID THAT IS CRAZY OLAF
3934-102415-0037 HE HAS BEEN THAT WAY FOR TWENTY YEARS SPENDS HIS TIME DIGGING WELLS BUT HE NEVER GETS ANY WATER AND THE SAND CAVES IN ALMOST AS FAST AS HE CAN GET IT OUT THEN HE LAUNCHED UPON A RECITAL OF HOW HE GOT SWEET WATER
3934-102415-0038 BY PIPING PAST THE ALKALI STRATA I KEPT HOPING HE WOULD TELL HOW OLAF WAS KEPT AND WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM BUT HE NEVER TOLD HE INVITED US TO PREPARE OUR SUPPER IN HIS KITCHEN
3934-102415-0039 AND AS IT WAS LATE AND WOOD WAS SCARCE WE WERE GLAD TO ACCEPT HE BUSTLED ABOUT HELPING US ADDING SUCH DAINTIES AS FRESH MILK BUTTER AND EGGS TO OUR MENU
3934-102415-0040 HE IS A RATHER STOUT LITTLE MAN WITH MERRY GRAY EYES AND BROWN HAIR BEGINNING TO GRAY HE WORE A RED SHIRT AND BLUE OVERALLS AND HE WIPED HIS BUTCHER'S KNIFE IMPARTIALLY ON THE LEGS OF HIS OVERALLS OR HIS TOWEL
3934-102415-0041 JUST WHICHEVER WAS HANDIEST AS HE HURRIED ABOUT CUTTING OUR BACON AND OPENING CANS FOR US MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY AND HE GOT ON FAMOUSLY AFTER SUPPER WHILE SHE AND ELIZABETH WASHED THE DISHES
3934-102415-0042 SHE ASKED HIM WHY HE DIDN'T GET MARRIED AND HAVE SOME ONE TO LOOK AFTER HIM AND HIS CABIN I DON'T HAVE TIME HE ANSWERED I CAME WEST EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO TO MAKE A START AND A HOME FOR JENNIE AND ME
