3340-169293-0000 THE ATLANTA EXPOSITION AT WHICH I HAD BEEN ASKED TO MAKE AN ADDRESS AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NEGRO RACE AS STATED IN THE LAST CHAPTER WAS OPENED WITH A SHORT ADDRESS FROM GOVERNOR BULLOCK AFTER OTHER INTERESTING EXERCISES INCLUDING AN INVOCATION FROM BISHOP NELSON OF GEORGIA
3340-169293-0001 AS I REMEMBER IT NOW THE THING THAT WAS UPPERMOST IN MY MIND WAS THE DESIRE TO SAY SOMETHING THAT WOULD CEMENT THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE RACES AND BRING ABOUT HEARTY COOPERATION BETWEEN THEM
3340-169293-0002 I BUT CONVEY TO YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND DIRECTORS THE SENTIMENT OF THE MASSES OF MY RACE WHEN I SAY THAT IN NO WAY HAVE THE VALUE AND MANHOOD OF THE AMERICAN NEGRO BEEN MORE FITTINGLY AND GENEROUSLY RECOGNIZED
3340-169293-0003 THAN BY THE MANAGERS OF THIS MAGNIFICENT EXPOSITION AT EVERY STAGE OF ITS PROGRESS IT IS A RECOGNITION THAT WILL DO MORE TO CEMENT THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE TWO RACES THAN ANY OCCURRENCE SINCE THE DAWN OF OUR FREEDOM
3340-169293-0004 NOT ONLY THIS BUT THE OPPORTUNITY HERE AFFORDED WILL AWAKEN AMONG US A NEW ERA OF INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS IGNORANT AND INEXPERIENCED IT IS NOT STRANGE THAT IN THE FIRST YEARS OF OUR NEW LIFE WE BEGAN AT THE TOP INSTEAD OF AT THE BOTTOM
3340-169293-0005 THAT A SEAT IN CONGRESS OR THE STATE LEGISLATURE WAS MORE SOUGHT THAN REAL ESTATE OR INDUSTRIAL SKILL THAT THE POLITICAL CONVENTION OR STUMP SPEAKING HAD MORE ATTRACTIONS THAN STARTING A DAIRY FARM OR TRUCK GARDEN
3340-169293-0006 CAST DOWN YOUR BUCKET WHERE YOU ARE A SECOND TIME THE SIGNAL WATER WATER SEND US WATER RAN UP FROM THE DISTRESSED VESSEL AND WAS ANSWERED CAST DOWN YOUR BUCKET WHERE YOU ARE AND A THIRD AND FOURTH SIGNAL FOR WATER WAS ANSWERED CAST DOWN YOUR BUCKET WHERE YOU ARE
3340-169293-0007 THE CAPTAIN OF THE DISTRESSED VESSEL AT LAST HEADING THE INJUNCTION CAST DOWN HIS BUCKET AND IT CAME UP FULL OF FRESH SPARKLING WATER FROM THE MOUTH OF THE AMAZON RIVER
3340-169293-0008 TO THOSE OF MY RACE WHO DEPEND ON BETTERING THEIR CONDITION IN A FOREIGN LAND OR WHO UNDERESTIMATE THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTIVATING FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE SOUTHERN WHITE MAN WHO IS THEIR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOUR I WOULD SAY
3340-169293-0009 NO RACE CAN PROSPER TILL IT LEARNS THAT THERE IS AS MUCH DIGNITY IN TILLING A FIELD AS IN WRITING A POEM IT IS AT THE BOTTOM OF LIFE WE MUST BEGIN
3340-169293-0010 BUILDED YOUR RAILROADS AND CITIES AND BROUGHT FORTH TREASURES FROM THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH AND HELPED MAKE POSSIBLE THIS MAGNIFICENT REPRESENTATION OF THE PROGRESS OF THE SOUTH CASTING DOWN YOUR BUCKET AMONG MY PEOPLE HELPING AND ENCOURAGING THEM AS YOU ARE DOING ON THESE GROUNDS
3340-169293-0011 AND TO EDUCATION OF HEAD HAND AND HEART YOU WILL FIND THAT THEY WILL BUY YOUR SURPLUS LAND MAKE BLOSSOM THE WASTE PLACES IN YOUR FIELDS AND RUN YOUR FACTORIES
3340-169293-0012 WHILE DOING THIS YOU CAN BE SURE IN THE FUTURE AS IN THE PAST THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES WILL BE SURROUNDED BY THE MOST PATIENT FAITHFUL LAW ABIDING AND UNRESENTFUL PEOPLE THAT THE WORLD HAS SEEN
3340-169293-0013 AS WE HAVE PROVED OUR LOYALTY TO YOU IN THE PAST NURSING YOUR CHILDREN WATCHING BY THE SICK BED OF YOUR MOTHERS AND FATHERS
3340-169293-0014 THERE IS NO DEFENCE OR SECURITY FOR ANY OF US EXCEPT IN THE HIGHEST INTELLIGENCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF ALL IF ANYWHERE THERE ARE EFFORTS TENDING TO CURTAIL THE FULLEST GROWTH OF THE NEGRO LET THESE EFFORTS BE TURNED INTO STIMULATING ENCOURAGING AND MAKING HIM THE MOST USEFUL AND INTELLIGENT CITIZEN
3340-169293-0015 THE LAWS OF CHANGELESS JUSTICE BIND OPPRESSOR WITH OPPRESSED AND CLOSE AS SIN AND SUFFERING JOINED WE MARCH TO FATE ABREAST NEARLY SIXTEEN MILLIONS OF HANDS WILL AID YOU IN PULLING THE LOAD UPWARD OR THEY WILL PULL AGAINST YOU THE LOAD DOWNWARD
3340-169293-0016 WE SHALL CONSTITUTE ONE THIRD AND MORE OF THE IGNORANCE AND CRIME OF THE SOUTH OR ONE THIRD ITS INTELLIGENCE AND PROGRESS WE SHALL CONTRIBUTE ONE THIRD TO THE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRIAL PROSPERITY OF THE SOUTH OR WE SHALL PROVE A VERITABLE BODY OF DEATH STAGNATING DEPRESSING RETARDING EVERY EFFORT TO ADVANCE THE BODY POLITIC
3340-169293-0017 STARTING THIRTY YEARS AGO WITH OWNERSHIP HERE AND THERE IN A FEW QUILTS AND PUMPKINS AND CHICKENS GATHERED FROM MISCELLANEOUS SOURCES REMEMBER THE PATH THAT HAS LED FROM THESE TO THE INVENTIONS AND PRODUCTION OF AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS BUGGIES STEAM ENGINES NEWSPAPERS BOOKS
3340-169293-0018 STATUARY CARVING PAINTINGS THE MANAGEMENT OF DRUG STORES AND BANKS HAS NOT BEEN TRODDEN WITHOUT CONTACT WITH THORNS AND THISTLES WHILE WE TAKE PRIDE IN WHAT WE EXHIBIT AS A RESULT OF OUR INDEPENDENT EFFORTS WE DO NOT FOR A MOMENT FORGET THAT OUR PART IN THIS EXHIBITION WOULD FALL FAR SHORT OF YOUR EXPECTATIONS
3340-169293-0019 BUT IT IS VASTLY MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE BE PREPARED FOR THE EXERCISES OF THESE PRIVILEGES THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN A DOLLAR IN A FACTORY JUST NOW IS WORTH INFINITELY MORE THAN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND A DOLLAR IN AN OPERA HOUSE
3340-169293-0020 IN CONCLUSION MAY I REPEAT THAT NOTHING IN THIRTY YEARS HAS GIVEN US MORE HOPE AND ENCOURAGEMENT
3340-169293-0021 AND DRAWN US SO NEAR TO YOU OF THE WHITE RACE AS THIS OPPORTUNITY OFFERED BY THE EXPOSITION AND HERE BENDING AS IT WERE OVER THE ALTAR THAT REPRESENTS THE RESULTS OF THE STRUGGLES OF YOUR RACE AND MINE BOTH STARTING PRACTICALLY EMPTY HANDED THREE DECADES AGO I PLEDGE THAT IN YOUR EFFORT TO WORK OUT THE GREAT AND INTRICATE PROBLEM WHICH GOD HAS LAID AT THE DOORS OF THE SOUTH
3340-169293-0022 YOU SHALL HAVE AT ALL TIMES THE PATIENT SYMPATHETIC HELP OF MY RACE
3340-169293-0023 I RECEIVED SO MANY AND SUCH HEARTY CONGRATULATIONS THAT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET OUT OF THE BUILDING I DID NOT APPRECIATE TO ANY DEGREE HOWEVER THE IMPRESSION WHICH MY ADDRESS SEEMED TO HAVE MADE UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING WHEN I WENT INTO THE BUSINESS PART OF THE CITY
3340-169293-0024 AS SOON AS I WAS RECOGNIZED I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND MYSELF POINTED OUT AND SURROUNDED BY A CROWD OF MEN WHO WISHED TO SHAKE HANDS WITH ME
3340-169293-0025 TELEGRAPHED TO A NEW YORK PAPER AMONG OTHER WORDS THE FOLLOWING I DO NOT EXAGGERATE WHEN I SAY THAT PROFESSOR BOOKER T WASHINGTON'S ADDRESS YESTERDAY WAS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE SPEECHES BOTH AS TO CHARACTER AND AS TO THE WARMTH OF ITS RECEPTION EVER DELIVERED TO A SOUTHERN AUDIENCE
3340-169293-0026 THE ADDRESS WAS A REVELATION THE WHOLE SPEECH IS A PLATFORM UPON WHICH BLACKS AND WHITES CAN STAND WITH FULL JUSTICE TO EACH OTHER THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT SAID EDITORIALLY
3340-169293-0027 ONE LECTURE BUREAU OFFERED ME FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A NIGHT AND EXPENSES IF I WOULD PLACE MY SERVICES AT ITS DISPOSAL FOR A GIVEN PERIOD
3340-169293-0028 SOME DAYS AFTER ITS DELIVERY I SENT A COPY OF MY ADDRESS TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE HON GROVER CLEVELAND I RECEIVED FROM HIM THE FOLLOWING AUTOGRAPH REPLY
3340-169293-0029 YOURS VERY TRULY GROVER CLEVELAND LATER I MET MISTER CLEVELAND FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN AS PRESIDENT HE VISITED THE ATLANTA EXPOSITION
3340-169293-0030 AT THE REQUEST OF MYSELF AND OTHERS HE CONSENTED TO SPEND AN HOUR IN THE NEGRO BUILDING FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSPECTING THE NEGRO EXHIBIT AND OF GIVING THE COLOURED PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM AS SOON AS I MET MISTER CLEVELAND I BECAME IMPRESSED WITH HIS SIMPLICITY GREATNESS AND RUGGED HONESTY
3340-169293-0031 BUT HAS ALWAYS CONSENTED TO DO ANYTHING I HAVE ASKED OF HIM FOR OUR SCHOOL THIS HE HAS DONE WHETHER IT WAS TO MAKE A PERSONAL DONATION OR TO USE HIS INFLUENCE IN SECURING THE DONATIONS OF OTHERS JUDGING FROM MY PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISTER CLEVELAND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT HE IS CONSCIOUS OF POSSESSING ANY COLOUR PREJUDICE
3340-169293-0032 HE IS TOO GREAT FOR THAT IN MY CONTACT WITH PEOPLE I FIND THAT AS A RULE IT IS ONLY THE LITTLE NARROW PEOPLE WHO LIVE FOR THEMSELVES WHO NEVER READ GOOD BOOKS WHO DO NOT TRAVEL
3340-169293-0033 I HAVE ALSO FOUND THAT FEW THINGS IF ANY ARE CAPABLE OF MAKING ONE SO BLIND AND NARROW AS RACE PREJUDICE I OFTEN SAY TO OUR STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF MY TALKS TO THEM ON SUNDAY EVENINGS IN THE CHAPEL THAT THE LONGER I LIVE AND THE MORE EXPERIENCE I HAVE OF THE WORLD
3340-169293-0034 THE MORE I AM CONVINCED THAT AFTER ALL THE ONE THING THAT IS MOST WORTH LIVING FOR AND DYING FOR IF NEED BE IS THE OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING SOME ONE ELSE MORE HAPPY AND MORE USEFUL
3340-169293-0035 BUT AFTER THE FIRST BURST OF ENTHUSIASM BEGAN TO DIE AWAY AND THE COLOURED PEOPLE BEGAN READING THE SPEECH IN COLD TYPE SOME OF THEM SEEMED TO FEEL THAT THEY HAD BEEN HYPNOTIZED THEY SEEMED TO FEEL THAT I HAD BEEN TOO LIBERAL IN MY REMARKS TOWARD THE SOUTHERN WHITES
3340-169293-0036 BUT LATER THESE REACTIONARY ONES SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN WON OVER TO MY WAY OF BELIEVING AND ACTING WHILE SPEAKING OF CHANGES IN PUBLIC SENTIMENT I RECALL THAT ABOUT TEN YEARS AFTER THE SCHOOL AT TUSKEGEE WAS ESTABLISHED I HAD AN EXPERIENCE THAT I SHALL NEVER FORGET
3340-169293-0037 I WROTE THE LETTER GIVING THE EXACT FACTS AS I CONCEIVED THEM TO BE THE PICTURE PAINTED WAS A RATHER BLACK ONE OR SINCE I AM BLACK SHALL I SAY WHITE IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE WITH A RACE BUT A FEW YEARS OUT OF SLAVERY A RACE WHICH HAD NOT HAD TIME OR OPPORTUNITY TO PRODUCE A COMPETENT MINISTRY
3340-169293-0038 THIS MISSIONARY HAD A SON IN THE SCHOOL AND I NOTICED THAT WHATEVER THE MISSIONARY MIGHT HAVE SAID OR DONE WITH REGARD TO OTHERS HE WAS CAREFUL NOT TO TAKE HIS SON AWAY FROM THE INSTITUTION
3340-169293-0039 I KNEW THAT I WAS RIGHT AND THAT TIME AND THE SOBER SECOND THOUGHT OF THE PEOPLE WOULD VINDICATE ME IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE BISHOPS AND OTHER CHURCH LEADERS BEGAN TO MAKE CAREFUL INVESTIGATION OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE MINISTRY AND THEY FOUND OUT THAT I WAS RIGHT
3340-169293-0040 IN FACT THE OLDEST AND MOST INFLUENTIAL BISHOP IN ONE BRANCH OF THE METHODIST CHURCH SAID THAT MY WORDS WERE FAR TOO MILD VERY SOON PUBLIC SENTIMENT BEGAN MAKING ITSELF FELT IN DEMANDING A PURIFYING OF THE MINISTRY
3340-169293-0041 I HAVE HAD THE SATISFACTION OF HAVING MANY WHO ONCE CONDEMNED ME THANK ME HEARTILY FOR MY FRANK WORDS THE CHANGE OF THE ATTITUDE OF THE NEGRO MINISTRY SO FAR AS REGARDS MYSELF IS SO COMPLETE THAT AT THE PRESENT TIME I HAVE NO WARMER FRIENDS AMONG ANY CLASS THAN I HAVE AMONG THE CLERGYMEN
3340-169293-0042 THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE CHARACTER AND LIFE OF THE NEGRO MINISTERS IS ONE OF THE MOST GRATIFYING EVIDENCES OF THE PROGRESS OF THE RACE MY EXPERIENCE WITH THEM AS WELL AS OTHER EVENTS IN MY LIFE CONVINCE ME THAT THE THING TO DO WHEN ONE FEELS SURE THAT HE HAS SAID OR DONE THE RIGHT THING AND IS CONDEMNED
3340-169293-0043 IS TO STAND STILL AND KEEP QUIET IF HE IS RIGHT TIME WILL SHOW IT IN THE MIDST OF THE DISCUSSION WHICH WAS GOING ON CONCERNING MY ATLANTA SPEECH I RECEIVED THE LETTER WHICH I GIVE BELOW FROM DOCTOR GILMAN THE PRESIDENT OF JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY
3340-169293-0044 WHO HAD BEEN MADE CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDGES OF AWARD IN CONNECTION WITH THE ATLANTA EXPOSITION JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY BALTIMORE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN NINETY FIVE DEAR MISTER WASHINGTON
3340-169293-0045 WOULD IT BE AGREEABLE TO YOU TO BE ONE OF THE JUDGES OF AWARD IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AT ATLANTA IF SO I SHALL BE GLAD TO PLACE YOUR NAME UPON THE LIST A LINE BY TELEGRAPH WILL BE WELCOMED YOURS VERY TRULY D C GILMAN
3340-169293-0046 TO PASS NOT ONLY UPON THE EXHIBITS OF THE COLOURED SCHOOLS BUT ALSO UPON THOSE OF THE WHITE SCHOOLS I ACCEPTED THE POSITION AND SPENT A MONTH IN ATLANTA IN PERFORMANCE OF THE DUTIES WHICH IT ENTAILED
3340-169293-0047 THE BOARD OF JURORS WAS A LARGE ONE CONTAINING IN ALL OF SIXTY MEMBERS IT WAS ABOUT EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN SOUTHERN WHITE PEOPLE AND NORTHERN WHITE PEOPLE AMONG THEM WERE COLLEGE PRESIDENTS LEADING SCIENTISTS AND MEN OF LETTERS AND SPECIALISTS IN MANY SUBJECTS
3340-169293-0048 WHEN THE GROUP OF JURORS TO WHICH I WAS ASSIGNED MET FOR ORGANIZATION MISTER THOMAS NELSON PAGE WHO WAS ONE OF THE NUMBER MOVED THAT I BE MADE SECRETARY OF THAT DIVISION AND THE MOTION WAS UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED NEARLY HALF OF OUR DIVISION WERE SOUTHERN PEOPLE
3340-169293-0049 IN PERFORMING MY DUTIES IN THE INSPECTION OF THE EXHIBITS OF WHITE SCHOOLS I WAS IN EVERY CASE TREATED WITH RESPECT AND AT THE CLOSE OF OUR LABOURS I PARTED FROM MY ASSOCIATES WITH REGRET
3340-169293-0050 ALTHOUGH I HAVE NEVER BEFORE SAID SO IN SO MANY WORDS THAT THE TIME WILL COME WHEN THE NEGRO IN THE SOUTH WILL BE ACCORDED ALL THE POLITICAL RIGHTS WHICH HIS ABILITY CHARACTER AND MATERIAL POSSESSIONS ENTITLE HIM TO I THINK THOUGH THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO FREELY EXERCISE SUCH POLITICAL RIGHTS
3340-169293-0051 WILL NOT COME IN ANY LARGE DEGREE THROUGH OUTSIDE OR ARTIFICIAL FORCING BUT WILL BE ACCORDED TO THE NEGRO BY THE SOUTHERN WHITE PEOPLE THEMSELVES
3340-169293-0052 IN FACT THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT IT IS ALREADY BEGINNING IN A SLIGHT DEGREE LET ME ILLUSTRATE MY MEANING SUPPOSE THAT SOME MONTHS BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE ATLANTA EXPOSITION THERE HAD BEEN A GENERAL DEMAND FROM THE PRESS AND PUBLIC PLATFORM OUTSIDE THE SOUTH THAT A NEGRO BE GIVEN A PLACE ON THE OPENING PROGRAMME
3340-169293-0053 AND THAT A NEGRO BE PLACED UPON THE BOARD OF JURORS OF AWARD WOULD ANY SUCH RECOGNITION OF THE RACE HAVE TAKEN PLACE I DO NOT THINK SO
3340-169293-0054 TO DEPORT HIMSELF MODESTLY IN REGARD TO POLITICAL CLAIMS DEPENDING UPON THE SLOW BUT SURE INFLUENCES THAT PROCEED FROM THE POSSESSION OF PROPERTY INTELLIGENCE AND HIGH CHARACTER FOR THE FULL RECOGNITION OF HIS POLITICAL RIGHTS I THINK THAT THE ACCORDING OF THE FULL EXERCISE OF POLITICAL RIGHTS IS GOING TO BE A MATTER OF NATURAL SLOW GROWTH NOT AN OVER NIGHT GOURD VINE AFFAIR
3340-169293-0055 I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE NEGRO SHOULD CEASE VOTING FOR A MAN CANNOT LEARN THE EXERCISE OF SELF GOVERNMENT BY CEASING TO VOTE ANY MORE THAN A BOY CAN LEARN TO SWIM BY KEEPING OUT OF THE WATER BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IN HIS VOTING
3340-169293-0056 HE SHOULD MORE AND MORE BE INFLUENCED BY THOSE OF INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER WHO ARE HIS NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOURS I KNOW COLOURED MEN WHO THROUGH THE ENCOURAGEMENT HELP AND ADVICE OF SOUTHERN WHITE PEOPLE
3340-169293-0057 HAVE ACCUMULATED THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF PROPERTY BUT WHO AT THE SAME TIME WOULD NEVER THINK OF GOING TO THOSE SAME PERSONS FOR ADVICE CONCERNING THE CASTING OF THEIR BALLOTS THIS IT SEEMS TO ME IS UNWISE AND UNREASONABLE AND SHOULD CEASE
3340-169293-0058 IN SAYING THIS I DO NOT MEAN THAT THE NEGRO SHOULD TRUCKLE OR NOT VOTE FROM PRINCIPLE FOR THE INSTANT HE CEASES TO VOTE FROM PRINCIPLE HE LOSES THE CONFIDENCE AND RESPECT OF THE SOUTHERN WHITE MAN EVEN
3340-169293-0059 SUCH A LAW IS NOT ONLY UNJUST BUT IT WILL REACT AS ALL UNJUST LAWS DO IN TIME FOR THE EFFECT OF SUCH A LAW IS TO ENCOURAGE THE NEGRO TO SECURE EDUCATION AND PROPERTY AND AT THE SAME TIME IT ENCOURAGES THE WHITE MAN TO REMAIN IN IGNORANCE AND POVERTY
3340-169293-0060 AND THAT THE MAN WHO DOES THIS ENDS HIS CAREER OF DISHONESTY BY THE THEFT OF PROPERTY OR BY SOME EQUALLY SERIOUS CRIME IN MY OPINION THE TIME WILL COME WHEN THE SOUTH WILL ENCOURAGE ALL OF ITS CITIZENS TO VOTE IT WILL SEE THAT IT PAYS BETTER FROM EVERY STANDPOINT TO HAVE HEALTHY VIGOROUS LIFE
3340-169293-0061 THAN TO HAVE THAT POLITICAL STAGNATION WHICH ALWAYS RESULTS WHEN ONE HALF OF THE POPULATION HAS NO SHARE AND NO INTEREST IN THE GOVERNMENT
