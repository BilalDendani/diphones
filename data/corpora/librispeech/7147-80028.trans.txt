7147-80028-0000 DID NOT CERTAINLY IMPLY ANY FEELING THAT HE HAD DISGRACED HIMSELF BY WHAT HE HAD DONE EITHER AT MANOR CROSS OR UP IN LONDON PERHAPS THE LADIES THERE DID NOT KNOW AS MUCH OF HIS HABITS AS DID MISSUS WALKER AT SCUMBERG'S
7147-80028-0001 PERHAPS THE FEELING WAS STRONG THAT POPENJOY WAS POPENJOY
7147-80028-0002 IF A CHILD BE BORN IN BRITISH PURPLE TRUE PURPLE THOUGH IT MAY HAVE BEEN STAINED BY CIRCUMSTANCES THAT PURPLE IS VERY SACRED
7147-80028-0003 THERE WAS STILL A GOOD DEAL OF MYSTERY BOTH AS TO POPENJOY AND AS TO THE FIREPLACE
7147-80028-0004 EVERYONE AT RUDHAM WAS ANXIOUS TO SIT BY HIS SIDE AND TO BE ALLOWED TO TALK TO HIM WHEN HE ABUSED THE DEAN WHICH HE DID FREELY THOSE WHO HEARD HIM ASSENTED TO ALL HE SAID
7147-80028-0005 THE BARONESS BANMANN HELD UP HER HANDS IN HORROR WHEN SHE HEARD THE TALE
7147-80028-0006 WAS PERTINACIOUS IN HER ENQUIRIES AFTER POPENJOY AND CRUELLY SARCASTIC UPON THE DEAN THINK WHAT WAS HIS BRINGING UP SAID MISSUS HOUGHTON
7147-80028-0007 THAT LORD GEORGE SHOULD HAVE MADE THAT MATCH NOT BUT WHAT SHE IS A GOOD CREATURE IN HER WAY SHE IS NO BETTER THAN SHE SHOULD BE
7147-80028-0008 THEN MISSUS HOUGHTON FOUND HERSELF ABLE TO INSINUATE THAT PERHAPS AFTER ALL MARY WAS NOT A GOOD CREATURE EVEN IN HER OWN WAY
7147-80028-0009 HE TALKED TO JACK ABOUT RACES AND BILLIARDS AND WOMEN BUT THOUGH HE DID NOT REFRAIN FROM ABUSING THE DEAN HE SAID NO WORD TO JACK AGAINST MARY
7147-80028-0010 HE WOULD DO NOTHING TO PREVENT IT THEY TELL ME SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
7147-80028-0011 SHE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL SAID JACK WHY THE DEVIL SHE SHOULD HAVE MARRIED GEORGE I CAN'T THINK SHE DOESN'T CARE FOR HIM THE LEAST DON'T YOU THINK SHE DOES I'M SURE SHE DON'T
7147-80028-0012 I SUPPOSE HER PESTILENT FATHER THOUGHT IT WAS THE NEAREST WAY TO A CORONET I DON'T KNOW WHY MEN SHOULD MARRY AT ALL THEY ALWAYS GET INTO TROUBLE BY IT SOMEBODY MUST HAVE CHILDREN SUGGESTED JACK I DON'T SEE THE NECESSITY
7147-80028-0013 AS THEY WERE TALKING THE BARONESS HAD COME UP TO THEM AND MADE HER LITTLE PROPOSITION WHAT A LECTURE IF MISTER DE BARON PLEASES OF COURSE I NEVER LISTEN TO LECTURES MYSELF EXCEPT FROM MY WIFE
7147-80028-0014 AH DAT IS VAT I VANT TO PREVENT
7147-80028-0015 VERY INTERESTING BUT I DON'T THINK I'M WELL ENOUGH MYSELF HERE IS CAPTAIN DE BARON A YOUNG MAN AS STRONG AS A HORSE AND VERY FOND OF WOMEN HE'LL SIT IT OUT I BEG YOUR PARDON WHAT IS IT
7147-80028-0016 THEN THE BARONESS WITH RAPID WORDS TOLD HER OWN SAD STORY SHE HAD BEEN DELUDED DEFRAUDED AND RUINED BY THOSE WICKED FEMALES LADY SELINA PROTEST AND DOCTOR FLEABODY
7147-80028-0017 SHE WAS RAPID AND ELOQUENT BUT NOT ALWAYS INTELLIGIBLE
7147-80028-0018 PECUNIARY ASSISTANCE I THINK MY LORD YAH YAH I HAVE BEEN BAMBOOZLED OF EVERYTHING MY LORD MARQUIS
7147-80028-0019 WOULD YOU MIND TELLING MY FELLOW TO GIVE HER A TEN POUND NOTE JACK SAID THAT HE WOULD NOT MIND AND THE BARONESS STUCK TO HIM PERTINACIOUSLY NOT LEAVING HIS SIDE A MOMENT TILL SHE HAD GOT THE MONEY OF COURSE THERE WAS NO LECTURE
7147-80028-0020 THE BARONESS WAS MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT VISITORS AT A COUNTRY HOUSE IN ENGLAND COULD NOT BE MADE TO ENDURE SUCH AN INFLICTION BUT SHE SUCCEEDED IN LEVYING A CONTRIBUTION FROM MISSUS MONTACUTE JONES AND THERE WERE RUMOURS AFLOAT THAT SHE GOT A SOVEREIGN OUT OF MISTER HOUGHTON
7147-80028-0021 LORD GIBLET HAD COME WITH THE INTENTION OF STAYING A WEEK BUT THE DAY AFTER THE ATTACK MADE UPON HIM BY MISSUS MONTACUTE JONES NEWS ARRIVED WHICH MADE IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD GO TO CASTLE GOSSLING AT ONCE
7147-80028-0022 WE SHALL BE SO SORRY TO MISS YOU SAID MISSUS MONTACUTE JONES WHOM HE TRIED TO AVOID IN MAKING HIS GENERAL ADIEUX BUT WHO WAS A GREAT DEAL TOO CLEVER NOT TO CATCH HIM MY FATHER WANTS TO SEE ME ABOUT THE PROPERTY YOU KNOW
7147-80028-0023 OF COURSE THERE MUST BE A GREAT DEAL TO DO BETWEEN YOU EVERYBODY WHO KNEW THE AFFAIRS OF THE FAMILY WAS AWARE THAT THE OLD EARL NEVER THOUGHT OF CONSULTING HIS SON AND MISSUS MONTACUTE JONES KNEW EVERYTHING EVER SO MUCH THEREFORE I MUST BE OFF AT ONCE
7147-80028-0024 MY FELLOW IS PACKING MY THINGS NOW AND THERE IS A TRAIN IN AN HOUR'S TIME DID YOU HEAR FROM OLIVIA THIS MORNING NOT TO DAY I HOPE YOU ARE AS PROUD AS YOU OUGHT TO BE OF HAVING SUCH A SWEET GIRL BELONGING TO YOU
7147-80028-0025 I TOLD MISSUS GREEN THAT YOU WERE HERE AND THAT YOU WERE COMING TO MEET OLIVIA ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH WHAT DID SHE SAY SHE THINKS YOU OUGHT TO SEE MISTER GREEN AS YOU GO THROUGH LONDON HE IS THE EASIEST MOST GOOD NATURED MAN IN THE WORLD DON'T YOU THINK YOU MIGHT AS WELL SPEAK TO HIM
7147-80028-0026 WHO WAS MISSUS MONTACUTE JONES THAT SHE SHOULD TALK TO HIM IN THIS WAY I WOULD SEND A TELEGRAM IF I WERE YOU TO SAY I WOULD BE THERE TO NIGHT PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BEST SAID LORD GIBLET OH CERTAINLY NOW MIND WE EXPECT YOU TO DINNER ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH
7147-80028-0027 IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE YOU'D SPECIALLY LIKE ME TO ASK NOBODY IN PARTICULAR THANK YE ISN'T JACK DE BARON A FRIEND OF YOURS YES I LIKE JACK PRETTY WELL HE THINKS A GREAT DEAL OF HIMSELF YOU KNOW ALL THE YOUNG MEN DO THAT NOW
7147-80028-0028 AT ANY RATE I'LL ASK JACK TO MEET YOU UNFORTUNATELY FOR LORD GIBLET JACK APPEARED IN SIGHT AT THIS VERY MOMENT CAPTAIN DE BARON LORD GIBLET HAS BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO SAY THAT HE'LL COME TO MY LITTLE PLACE AT KILLANCODLEM
7147-80028-0029 ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH CAN YOU MEET HIM THERE DELIGHTED MISSUS JONES WHO EVER REFUSES TO GO TO KILLANCODLEM IT ISN'T KILLANCODLEM AND ITS LITTLE COMFORTS THAT ARE BRINGING HIS LORDSHIP
7147-80028-0030 WE SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO SEE HIM BUT HE IS COMING TO SEE WELL I SUPPOSE IT'S NO SECRET NOW LORD GIBLET JACK BOWED HIS CONGRATULATIONS AND LORD GIBLET AGAIN BLUSHED AS RED AS A ROSE DETESTABLE OLD WOMAN
7147-80028-0031 WHITHER SHOULD HE TAKE HIMSELF IN WHAT FURTHEST PART OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS SHOULD HE SPEND THE COMING AUTUMN IF NEITHER MISTER NOR MISSUS GREEN CALLED UPON HIM FOR AN EXPLANATION WHAT POSSIBLE RIGHT COULD THIS ABOMINABLE OLD HARPY HAVE TO PREY UPON HIM
7147-80028-0032 HE KNEW MEN WHO HAD DONE TEN TIMES AS MUCH AND HAD NOT BEEN AS SEVERELY HANDLED AND HE WAS SURE THAT JACK DE BARON HAD HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT JACK HAD BEEN HAND IN HAND WITH MISSUS JONES AT THE MAKING UP OF THE KAPPA KAPPA
7147-80028-0033 BUT AS HE WENT TO THE STATION HE REFLECTED THAT OLIVIA GREEN WAS A VERY NICE GIRL IF THOSE TEN THOUSAND POUNDS WERE TRUE THEY WOULD BE A GREAT COMFORT TO HIM HIS MOTHER WAS ALWAYS BOTHERING HIM TO GET MARRIED
7147-80028-0034 IF HE COULD BRING HIMSELF TO ACCEPT THIS AS HIS FATE HE WOULD BE SAVED A DEAL OF TROUBLE SPOONING AT KILLANCODLEM AFTER ALL WOULD NOT BE BAD FUN HE ALMOST TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD MARRY MISS GREEN
7147-80028-0035 WERE IT NOT THAT HE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO BE DICTATED TO BY THAT OLD HARRIDAN MANY PEOPLE CAME AND WENT AT RUDHAM PARK BUT AMONG THOSE WHO DID NOT GO WAS GUSS MILDMAY AUNT JULIA
7147-80028-0036 WHO HAD BECOME THOROUGHLY ASHAMED OF THE BARONESS HAD WISHED TO TAKE HER DEPARTURE ON THE THIRD DAY BUT GUSS HAD MANAGED TO STOP HER WHAT'S THE GOOD OF COMING TO A HOUSE FOR THREE DAYS YOU SAID YOU MEANT TO STAY A WEEK THEY KNOW WHAT SHE IS NOW AND THE HARM'S DONE
7147-80028-0037 IT WAS YOUR OWN FAULT FOR BRINGING HER I DON'T SEE WHY I'M TO BE THROWN OVER BECAUSE YOU'VE MADE A MISTAKE ABOUT A VULGAR OLD WOMAN
7147-80028-0038 AND NOW WE ARE OUT OF TOWN FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE LET US STAY AS LONG AS WE CAN IN THIS WAY GUSS CARRIED HER POINT WATCHING HER OPPORTUNITY FOR A LITTLE CONVERSATION WITH HER FORMER LOVER AT LAST THE OPPORTUNITY CAME
7147-80028-0039 AT LAST SHE MADE THE OPPORTUNITY CALLING UPON HIM TO WALK WITH HER ONE SUNDAY MORNING WHEN ALL OTHER FOLK WERE IN CHURCH OR PERHAPS IN BED NO I WON'T GO TO CHURCH SHE HAD SAID TO AUNT JU
7147-80028-0040 WHAT IS THE USE OF YOUR ASKING WHY NOT I WON'T GO THEY ARE QUITE ACCUSTOMED AT RUDHAM TO PEOPLE NOT GOING TO CHURCH I ALWAYS GO IN A STIFF HOUSE BUT I WON'T GO HERE WHEN YOU ARE AT ROME YOU SHOULD DO AS THE ROMANS DO
7147-80028-0041 I DON'T SUPPOSE THERE'LL BE HALF A DOZEN THERE OUT OF THE WHOLE PARTY AUNT JU WENT TO CHURCH AS A MATTER OF COURSE
7147-80028-0042 ARE YOU GOING TO KILLANCODLEM SHE SAID I SUPPOSE I SHALL FOR A FEW DAYS HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY BEFORE YOU GO NOTHING PARTICULAR OF COURSE I DON'T MEAN TO ME
7147-80028-0043 I'VE NOTHING PARTICULAR TO SAY TO ANYBODY JUST AT PRESENT
7147-80028-0044 IT'S QUITE A PLEASURE TO HEAR HIM ABUSE THE DEAN AND THE DEAN'S DAUGHTER HE HAS NOT MUCH GOOD TO SAY ABOUT HER EITHER I'M NOT SURPRISED AT THAT JACK
7147-80028-0045 VERY LITTLE GUSS AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY TO ME ABOUT HER NOTHING AT ALL GUSS SHE'S ALL THE WORLD TO YOU I SUPPOSE WHAT'S THE USE OF YOUR SAYING THAT IN ONE SENSE SHE'S NOTHING TO ME
7147-80028-0046 MY BELIEF IS THAT THE ONLY MAN SHE'LL EVER CARE A PIN ABOUT IS HER HUSBAND AT ANY RATE SHE DOES NOT CARE A STRAW FOR ME NOR YOU FOR HER WELL YES I DO SHE'S ONE OF MY PET FRIENDS
7147-80028-0047 THERE'S NOBODY I LIKE BEING WITH BETTER AND IF SHE WERE NOT MARRIED GOD KNOWS WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED I MIGHT HAVE ASKED HER TO HAVE ME BECAUSE SHE HAS GOT MONEY OF HER OWN WHAT'S THE USE OF COMING BACK TO THE OLD THING GUSS
7147-80028-0048 MONEY MONEY MONEY NOTHING MORE UNFAIR WAS EVER SAID TO ANYONE HAVE I GIVEN ANY SIGNS OF SELLING MYSELF FOR MONEY HAVE I BEEN A FORTUNE HUNTER NO ONE HAS EVER FOUND ME GUILTY OF SO MUCH PRUDENCE

7147-80028-0060 GOD BLESS MY SOUL THAT'S GOING BACK TO THE BEGINNING YOU ARE HEARTLESS ABSOLUTELY HEARTLESS IT HAS COME TO THAT WITH YOU
7147-80028-0061 I CAN'T AFFORD IT MY DEAR BUT IS THERE NO SUCH THING AS LOVE THAT YOU CAN'T HELP CAN YOU DROP A GIRL OUT OF YOUR HEART ALTOGETHER SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE HAS GOT NO MONEY I SUPPOSE YOU DID LOVE ME ONCE HERE JACK SCRATCHED HIS HEAD
7147-80028-0062 YOU DID LOVE ME ONCE SHE SAID PERSEVERING WITH HER QUESTION OF COURSE I DID SAID JACK WHO HAD NO OBJECTION TO MAKING ASSURANCES OF THE PAST AND YOU DON'T NOW WHOEVER SAID SO
7147-80028-0063 WHAT'S THE GOOD OF TALKING ABOUT IT DO YOU THINK YOU OWE ME NOTHING WHAT'S THE GOOD OF OWING IF A MAN CAN'T PAY HIS DEBTS YOU WILL OWN NOTHING THEN YES I WILL IF ANYONE LEFT ME TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS TO MORROW THEN I SHOULD OWE YOU SOMETHING
7147-80028-0064 WHAT WOULD YOU OWE ME HALF OF IT AND HOW WOULD YOU PAY ME HE THOUGHT A WHILE BEFORE HE MADE HIS ANSWER
7147-80028-0065 YOU MEAN THEN THAT YOU WOULD MARRY ME
7147-80028-0066 IN THAT CASE YOU WOULD MARRY ME A MAN HAS NO RIGHT TO TAKE SO MUCH ON HIMSELF AS TO SAY THAT
7147-80028-0067 I SUPPOSE I SHOULD I SHOULD MAKE A DEVILISH BAD HUSBAND EVEN THEN WHY SHOULD YOU BE WORSE THAN OTHERS I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS I WAS MADE WORSE I CAN'T FANCY MYSELF DOING ANY DUTY WELL
7147-80028-0068 IF I HAD A WIFE OF MY OWN I SHOULD BE SURE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE'S LADY GEORGE FOR INSTANCE NO NOT LADY GEORGE IT WOULD NOT BE WITH SOMEBODY WHOM I HAD LEARNED TO THINK THE VERY BEST WOMAN IN ALL THE WORLD
7147-80028-0069 I AM VERY BAD BUT I'M JUST NOT BAD ENOUGH TO MAKE LOVE TO HER OR RATHER I AM VERY FOOLISH BUT JUST NOT FOOLISH ENOUGH TO THINK THAT I COULD WIN HER
7147-80028-0070 SHE'S NOT JUST THE SAME TO ME BUT I'D RATHER NOT TALK ABOUT HER GUSS I'M GOING TO KILLANCODLEM IN A DAY OR TWO AND I SHALL LEAVE THIS TO MORROW TO MORROW WELL YES TO MORROW I MUST BE A DAY OR TWO IN TOWN AND THERE IS NOT MUCH DOING HERE
7147-80028-0071 AND THERE'S NO MORE FUN TO BE MADE OF THE BARONESS I'M NOT SURE BUT THAT SHE HAS THE BEST OF THE FUN I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN IN THE WORLD COULD GET A FIVE POUND NOTE OUT OF ME BUT SHE HAD HOW COULD YOU BE SO FOOLISH HOW INDEED
7147-80028-0072 YOU'LL GO BACK TO LONDON I SUPPOSE SO UNLESS I DROWN MYSELF DON'T DO THAT GUSS I OFTEN THINK IT WILL BE BEST YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT MY LIFE IS HOW WRETCHED AND YOU MADE IT SO IS THAT FAIR GUSS
7147-80028-0073 QUITE FAIR QUITE TRUE YOU HAVE MADE IT MISERABLE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE OF COURSE YOU KNOW IT CAN I HELP IT NOW YES YOU CAN I CAN BE PATIENT IF YOU WILL SAY THAT IT SHALL BE SOME DAY
7147-80028-0074 WHEN YOU HAVE GOT THAT TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS BUT I SHALL NEVER HAVE IT IF YOU DO WILL YOU MARRY ME THEN WILL YOU PROMISE ME THAT YOU WILL NEVER MARRY ANYBODY ELSE I NEVER SHALL BUT WILL YOU PROMISE ME
7147-80028-0075 IF YOU WILL NOT SAY SO MUCH AS THAT TO ME YOU MUST BE FALSE INDEED WHEN YOU HAVE THE TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS WILL YOU MARRY ME OH CERTAINLY AND YOU CAN LAUGH ABOUT SUCH A MATTER WHEN I AM POURING OUT MY VERY SOUL TO YOU
7147-80028-0076 YOU CAN MAKE A JOKE OF IT WHEN IT IS ALL MY LIFE TO ME JACK IF YOU WILL SAY THAT IT SHALL HAPPEN SOME DAY SOME DAY I WILL BE HAPPY IF YOU WON'T I CAN ONLY DIE
7147-80028-0077 IT MAY BE PLAY TO YOU BUT IT'S DEATH TO ME HE LOOKED AT HER AND SAW THAT SHE WAS QUITE IN EARNEST SHE WAS NOT WEEPING BUT THERE WAS A DRAWN HEAVY LOOK ABOUT HER FACE WHICH IN TRUTH TOUCHED HIS HEART
7147-80028-0078 WHATEVER MIGHT BE HIS FAULTS HE WAS NOT A CRUEL MAN HE HAD DEFENDED HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY SCRUPLES OF CONSCIENCE WHEN SHE HAD SEEMED TO ATTACK HIM BUT NOW HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE HER REQUEST IT AMOUNTED TO SO LITTLE
7147-80028-0079 I DON'T SUPPOSE IT WILL EVER TAKE PLACE BUT I THINK I OUGHT TO ALLOW MYSELF TO CONSIDER MYSELF AS ENGAGED TO YOU SHE SAID AS IT IS YOU ARE FREE TO MARRY ANYONE ELSE HE REPLIED I DON'T CARE FOR SUCH FREEDOM I DON'T WANT IT
7147-80028-0080 I COULDN'T MARRY A MAN WHOM I DIDN'T LOVE NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THAT THEY CAN DO TILL THEY'RE TRIED DO YOU SUPPOSE SIR I'VE NEVER BEEN TRIED BUT I CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO LAUGH NOW JACK DON'T JOKE NOW
7147-80028-0081 HEAVEN KNOWS WHEN WE MAY SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN YOU WILL PROMISE ME THAT JACK YES IF YOU WISH IT AND SO AT LAST SHE HAD GOT A PROMISE FROM HIM SHE SAID NOTHING MORE TO FIX IT FEARING THAT IN DOING SO
7147-80028-0082 SHE MIGHT LOSE IT BUT SHE THREW HERSELF INTO HIS ARMS AND BURIED HER FACE UPON HIS BOSOM AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE WAS LEAVING HIM SHE WAS VERY SOLEMN IN HER MANNER TO HIM I WILL SAY GOOD BYE NOW JACK
7147-80028-0083 FOR I SHALL HARDLY SEE YOU AGAIN TO SPEAK TO YOU DO LOVE ME YOU KNOW I DO I AM SO TRUE TO YOU I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TRUE TO YOU GOD BLESS YOU JACK WRITE ME A LINE SOMETIMES
7147-80028-0084 THEN HE ESCAPED HAVING BROUGHT HER BACK TO THE GARDEN AMONG THE FLOWERS AND HE WANDERED AWAY BY HIMSELF ACROSS THE PARK AT LAST HE HAD ENGAGED HIMSELF HE KNEW THAT IT WAS SO AND HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD TELL ALL HER FRIENDS
7147-80028-0085 ADELAIDE HOUGHTON WOULD KNOW AND WOULD OF COURSE CONGRATULATE HIM THERE NEVER COULD BE A MARRIAGE THAT WOULD OF COURSE BE OUT OF THE QUESTION BUT
7147-80028-0086 HE WOULD BE THE YOUNG MAN ENGAGED TO MARRY AUGUSTA MILDMAY AND THEN HE COULD HARDLY NOW REFUSE TO ANSWER THE LETTERS WHICH SHE WOULD BE SURE TO WRITE TO HIM AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK THERE HAD BEEN A PREVIOUS PERIOD OF LETTER WRITING
7147-80028-0087 BUT THAT HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH THROUGH UTTER NEGLECT ON HIS PART BUT NOW IT MIGHT BE AS WELL THAT HE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW LAW AND EXCHANGE INTO AN INDIAN REGIMENT BUT EVEN IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION
7147-80028-0088 HIS MIND WAS NOT WHOLLY OCCUPIED WITH AUGUSTA MILDMAY THE EVIL WORDS WHICH HAD BEEN SPOKEN TO HIM OF MARY HAD NOT BEEN ALTOGETHER FRUITLESS HIS COUSIN ADELAIDE HAD TOLD HIM OVER AND OVER AGAIN
7147-80028-0089 THAT LADY GEORGE WAS AS OTHER WOMEN BY WHICH HIS COUSIN HAD INTENDED TO SAY THAT LADY GEORGE WAS THE SAME AS HERSELF AUGUSTA MILDMAY HAD SPOKEN OF HIS PHOENIX IN THE SAME STRAIN
7147-80028-0090 IT WAS NOT THAT HE WISHED TO THINK OF HER AS THEY THOUGHT OR THAT HE COULD BE BROUGHT SO TO THINK BUT THESE SUGGESTIONS COMING AS THEY DID FROM THOSE WHO KNEW HOW MUCH HE LIKED THE WOMAN AMOUNTED TO RIDICULE AIMED AGAINST THE PURITY OF HIS WORSHIP
7147-80028-0091 THEY TOLD HIM ALMOST TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS AFRAID TO SPEAK OF LOVE TO LADY GEORGE INDEED HE WAS AFRAID AND WITHIN HIS OWN BREAST HE WAS IN SOME SORT PROUD OF HIS FEAR BUT NEVERTHELESS HE WAS TOUCHED BY THEIR RIDICULE
7147-80028-0092 HE AND MARY HAD CERTAINLY BEEN DEAR FRIENDS CERTAINLY THAT FRIENDSHIP HAD GIVEN GREAT UMBRAGE TO HER HUSBAND WAS HE BOUND TO KEEP AWAY FROM HER BECAUSE OF HER HUSBAND'S ANGER HE KNEW THAT THEY TWO WERE NOT LIVING TOGETHER
7147-80028-0093 HE KNEW THAT THE DEAN WOULD AT ANY RATE WELCOME HIM AND HE KNEW TOO
7147-80028-0094 HE HAD NO PURPOSE AS TO ANYTHING THAT HE WOULD SAY TO HER BUT HE WAS RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD SEE HER IF THEN SOME WORD WARMER THAN ANY HE HAD YET SPOKEN SHOULD FALL FROM HIM HE WOULD GATHER FROM HER ANSWER WHAT HER FEELINGS WERE TOWARDS HIM
