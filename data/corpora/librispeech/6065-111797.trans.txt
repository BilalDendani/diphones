6065-111797-0000 PULLMAN THE SUBJECT OF THIS SKETCH WE CONSIDER ONE OF THE GREATEST OF PHILANTHROPISTS HE IS A MODEST MAN AND FOR THIS REASON DISCLAIMED ALL DESIRE TO BE KNOWN AS A BENEFACTOR
6065-111797-0001 BUT WE CANNOT NOW THINK OF ANY ONE WHO IS MORE CLEARLY IDENTIFIED WITH THE GREAT EFFORT
6065-111797-0002 BEING BORN IN THE WESTERN PART OF NEW YORK MARCH THIRD EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE HIS FATHER WAS A MECHANIC OF SOME NOTE BUT DIED BEFORE GEORGE WAS OF AGE LEAVING HIM TO HELP SUPPORT HIS MOTHER AND YOUNGER BROTHERS
6065-111797-0003 HE WORKED FOR A TIME IN A FURNITURE ESTABLISHMENT BUT THIS KIND OF EMPLOYMENT DID NOT SATISFY HIS ACTIVE NATURE AND HE WENT TO CHICAGO WHERE HIS ENTERPRISE COULD HAVE SEA ROOM
6065-111797-0004 HE AT FIRST BECAME IDENTIFIED WITH THE WORK OF RAISING AND PLACING NEW FOUNDATIONS UNDER SEVERAL LARGE BUILDINGS OF THAT CITY
6065-111797-0005 SEVERAL FEET HIGH AN ENTERPRISE WHICH WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT HARDLY A BREAK DISCONTINUING NONE OF THE BUSINESS FIRMS WHO OCCUPIED THE BUILDING THEIR BUSINESS BEING CARRIED ON UNINTERRUPTED
6065-111797-0006 GEORGE M PULLMAN HAD A PERCEPTIVE MIND SO HAVE ALL TRULY SUCCESSFUL MEN
6065-111797-0007 YET THEY WERE FAR INFERIOR TO WHAT HE IMAGINED THEY OUGHT TO BE HE AT ONCE APPLIED TO THE CHICAGO AND ALTON RAILWAY MANAGEMENT AND LAID HIS PLAN BEFORE THEM THEY FURNISHED HIM WITH TWO OLD COACHES WITH WHICH TO EXPERIMENT
6065-111797-0008 THESE HE FITTED UP WITH BUNKS AND WHILE THEY WERE NOT TO BE COMPARED WITH THE ELEGANT PALACES WHICH HE HAS SINCE CONSTRUCTED STILL ONE COULD LIE DOWN AND SLEEP ALL NIGHT WHICH WAS SO FAR IN ADVANCE OF ANYTHING THE PEOPLE HAD SEEN
6065-111797-0009 THAT THEY WERE VERY HIGHLY APPRECIATED HE NOW WENT TO COLORADO AND ENGAGED IN VARIOUS MINING SCHEMES BUT HERE HE WAS OUT OF HIS SPHERE
6065-111797-0010 RETURNED TO CHICAGO HIS ACTIVE IMAGINATION HAD THOUGHT OUT MANY IMPROVEMENTS ON THE CARS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY CONSTRUCTED AND HE HAD ALSO SECURED CAPITAL WITH WHICH TO CARRY OUT HIS IDEAS FITTING UP A SHOP ON THE CHICAGO AND ALTON ROAD
6065-111797-0011 HE CONSTRUCTED TWO COACHES AT THE THEN FABULOUS COST OF EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH THE MANAGEMENT OF THE VARIOUS WESTERN ROADS LOOKED UPON SUCH ENTERPRISE AS VISIONARY GEORGE M PULLMAN HOWEVER CARED BUT LITTLE ABOUT THEIR OPINION
6065-111797-0012 THE UNION AND PACIFIC WAS THEN EXCITING MUCH ATTENTION HE KNEW THAT ON THE COMPLETION OF SUCH A ROAD TRAVELERS WOULD APPRECIATE A CAR IN WHICH THEY COULD ENJOY THE COMFORTS OF HOME FOR THE ENTIRE TEDIOUS TRIP
6065-111797-0013 TO SAY THAT HIS HOPES WERE FULLY REALIZED WOULD BE INADEQUATE SO POPULAR DID THEY BECOME THAT HIS SHOPS AT CHICAGO COULD NOT BEGIN TO FILL THE DEMANDS MADE UPON IT FOR HIS PARLOR DINING AND SLEEPING CARS
6065-111797-0014 BRANCHES WERE STARTED AT DETROIT SAINT LOUIS PHILADELPHIA AND VARIOUS PLACES IN EUROPE THESE ESTABLISHMENTS OF NECESSITY
6065-111797-0015 THEREFORE CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF CONCENTRATING HIS BUSINESS INTO ONE VAST ESTABLISHMENT AND GATHERED ABOUT HIM A FORCE OF SKILLED WORKMEN HE LOOKED UPON CHICAGO AND ITS LOCALITY AS THE COMING CENTER OF POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES
6065-111797-0016 BUT A SITE IN THAT CITY WOULD BE FAR TOO EXPENSIVE IF INDEED ONE COULD HAVE BEEN FOUND SUFFICIENT FOR HIS PURPOSE ABOUT TWELVE TO FIFTEEN MILES FROM CHICAGO WAS A SWAMP IT WAS CONSIDERED WORTHLESS
6065-111797-0017 BUT IT WAS AS EASY FOR THIS NATURAL MECHANIC TO CONCEIVE THE IDEA OF DRAINING THIS TRACT OF LAND AS IT WAS TO CONCEIVE METHODS TO RAISE BUILDINGS A VERY LARGE FORCE OF MEN WERE PUT TO WORK DRAINING GAS PIPES WERE LAID
6065-111797-0018 STREETS WERE LAID OUT AND GRADED AND AN ARCHITECT EMPLOYED TO DRAW THE PLANS FOR THE BUILDING OF A WHOLE CITY AT ONCE GIGANTIC WORK SHOPS WERE BUILT AND A WATER SUPPLY BROUGHT FROM LAKE MICHIGAN MILES AWAY BESIDES ALL THIS
6065-111797-0019 OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED BEAUTIFUL HOMES WERE BUILT BEFORE ANY MAN WAS ASKED TO COME TO PULLMAN TO ENTER THE SHOPS A BANK WAS OPENED A LIBRARY CONTAINING THOUSANDS OF VOLUMES WAS PROVIDED ALL THESE THINGS WERE BROUGHT ABOUT BY MISTER PULLMAN
6065-111797-0020 THE BUILDINGS ARE NOT MUSHROOM AFFAIRS BUT SUBSTANTIAL BRICK EDIFICES WHICH GIVE THIS PLACE AN APPEARANCE WHICH WILL COMPARE FAVORABLY WITH ANY CITY HE BUILT A FINE HOTEL AND ERECTED A BEAUTIFUL CHURCH
6065-111797-0021 PLACING A RICH TONED ORGAN IN IT WHICH ALONE COST THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS EVERY HONEST TRADESMAN CAN COME TO PULLMAN NONE BUT LIQUOR DEALERS OR MEN WHO DESIRE TO KEEP LOW GROGGERIES ARE EXCLUDED
6065-111797-0022 NO PROPERTY IS SOLD BUT IF A PARTY DESIRES TO LIVE THERE HE APPLIES TO THE SUPERINTENDENT AND A LEASE IS GIVEN WHICH CAN BE CANCELLED BY EITHER PARTY AT TEN DAYS NOTICE NOTHING BUT LIQUOR IS FORBIDDEN
6065-111797-0023 A MAN CAN SQUANDER HIS TIME CAN GAMBLE POSSIBLY BUT HE CANNOT OBTAIN DRINK THE RESULT IS THERE ARE NO POLICEMEN NO VISIBLE FORM OF GOVERNMENT SAVE MISTER PULLMAN
6065-111797-0024 AND YET THIS IS A CITY OF NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE THE PEOPLE ARE NOT MUDDLED WITH DRINK THEY ARE PROMPTLY PAID THEIR PERSONAL RIGHTS ARE NOT INTERFERED WITH SAVE IN RESPECT TO THE SELLING OF LIQUOR THEY ARE CONTENTED AND HAPPY
6065-111797-0025 MISTER PULLMAN HAS BEEN LARGELY IDENTIFIED WITH THE METROPOLITAN RAILWAY AND THE EAGLETON WIRE WORKS IN NEW YORK CITY BUT THE NAME OF PULLMAN IS DESTINED TO LONG REMAIN A SYNONYM OF PHILANTHROPY
6065-111797-0026 HE HAS PRACTICALLY DEMONSTRATED THE BENEFIT OF LEGISLATION AGAINST THE SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS AS A BEVERAGE HE CLAIMS TO HAVE DONE THIS AS A BUSINESS POLICY AND DISCLAIMS ALL HONOR AS A PHILANTHROPIST WE ANSWER
