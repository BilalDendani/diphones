6378-61780-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTY SIX LOST IN THE CHALK STILL CONTINUING HIS FLEET CAREER THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN GALLOPED ON OVER THE PRAIRIE ZEB STUMP FOLLOWING ONLY WITH HIS EYES AND NOT UNTIL HE HAD PASSED OUT OF SIGHT BEHIND SOME STRAGGLING GROVES OF MEZQUITE
6378-61780-0001 DID THE BACKWOODSMAN ABANDON HIS KNEELING POSITION THEN ONLY FOR A SECOND OR TWO DID HE STAND ERECT TAKING COUNCIL WITH HIMSELF AS TO WHAT COURSE HE SHOULD PURSUE THE EPISODE STRANGE AS UNEXPECTED HAD CAUSED SOME DISARRANGEMENT IN HIS IDEAS
6378-61780-0002 SHOULD HE CONTINUE ALONG THE TRAIL HE WAS ALREADY DECIPHERING OR FORSAKE IT FOR THAT OF THE STEED THAT HAD JUST SWEPT BY BY KEEPING TO THE FORMER HE MIGHT FIND OUT MUCH BUT BY CHANGING TO THE LATTER HE MIGHT LEARN MORE
6378-61780-0003 HE MIGHT CAPTURE THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN AND ASCERTAIN FROM HIM THE WHY AND WHEREFORE OF HIS WILD WANDERINGS WHILE THUS ABSORBED IN CONSIDERING WHAT COURSE HE HAD BEST TAKE HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE PUFF OF SMOKE AND THE REPORT HEARD FAR OFF OVER THE PRAIRIE
6378-61780-0004 ONLY FOR A MOMENT HOWEVER THEY WERE THINGS TO BE REMEMBERED AND HE SOON REMEMBERED THEM TURNING HIS EYES TO THE QUARTER WHERE THE SMOKE HAD APPEARED HE SAW THAT WHICH CAUSED HIM TO SQUAT DOWN AGAIN AND PLACE HIMSELF WITH MORE IMPRESSEMENT THAN EVER UNDER COVER OF THE MEZQUITES
6378-61780-0005 THE OLD MARE RELISHING THE RECUMBENT ATTITUDE HAD STILL KEPT TO IT AND THERE WAS NO NECESSITY FOR RE DISPOSING OF HER WHAT ZEB NOW SAW WAS A MAN ON HORSEBACK A REAL HORSEMAN WITH A HEAD UPON HIS SHOULDERS
6378-61780-0006 HE WAS STILL A LONG WAY OFF AND IT WAS NOT LIKELY HE HAD SEEN THE TALL FORM OF THE HUNTER STANDING SHORED UP AMONG THE BUSHES MUCH LESS THE MARE LYING BENEATH THEM HE SHOWED NO SIGNS OF HAVING DONE SO ON THE CONTRARY HE WAS SITTING STOOPED IN THE SADDLE
6378-61780-0007 HIS BREAST BENT DOWN TO THE POMMEL AND HIS EYES ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN READING THE GROUND OVER WHICH HE WAS GUIDING HIS HORSE THERE COULD BE NO DIFFICULTY IN ASCERTAINING HIS OCCUPATION ZEB STUMP GUESSED IT AT A GLANCE HE WAS TRACKING THE HEADLESS RIDER
6378-61780-0008 I AIN'T THE ONLY ONE WHO'S GOT A REEZUN FOR SOLVIN THIS HYUR MYST'RY WHO THE HELL KIN HE BE I SHED JEST LIKE TO KNOW THAT ZEB HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT FOR THE GRATIFICATION OF HIS WISH AS THE TRAIL WAS FRESH THE STRANGE HORSEMAN COULD TAKE IT UP AT A TROT
6378-61780-0009 IN WHICH PACE HE WAS APPROACHING HE WAS SOON WITHIN IDENTIFYING DISTANCE
6378-61780-0010 I MOUT A KNOW'D IT WUD BE HIM AN EF I'M NOT MISTOOK ABOUT IT HYURS GOIN TO BE A OTHER CHAPTER OUT O THE SAME BOOK A OTHER LINK AS LL HELP ME TO KUMPLETE THE CHAIN O EVYDINCE I'M IN SARCH FOR
6378-61780-0011 LAY CLOST YE CRITTER EF YE MAKE ERE A STIR EVEN TO THE SHAKIN O THEM LONG LUGS O YOURN I'LL CUT YUR DARNED THROAT THE LAST SPEECH WAS AN APOSTROPHE TO THE MAAR
6378-61780-0012 THIS WAS A MAN WHO ONCE SEEN WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE SOON FORGOTTEN SCARCE THIRTY YEARS OLD HE SHOWED A COUNTENANCE SCATHED LESS WITH CARE THAN THE PLAY OF EVIL PASSIONS BUT THERE WAS CARE UPON IT NOW A CARE THAT SEEMED TO SPEAK OF APPREHENSION
6378-61780-0013 KEEN PROLONGED YET LOOKING FORWARD WITH A HOPE OF BEING RELIEVED FROM IT WITHAL IT WAS A HANDSOME FACE SUCH AS A GENTLEMAN NEED NOT HAVE BEEN ASHAMED OF BUT FOR THAT SINISTER EXPRESSION THAT TOLD OF ITS BELONGING TO A BLACKGUARD THE DRESS BUT WHY NEED WE DESCRIBE IT
6378-61780-0014 THE BLUE CLOTH FROCK OF SEMI MILITARY CUT THE FORAGE CAP THE BELT SUSTAINING A BOWIE KNIFE WITH A BRACE OF REVOLVING PISTOLS ALL HAVE BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE AS ENVELOPING AND EQUIPPING THE PERSON OF CAPTAIN CASSIUS CALHOUN IT WAS HE
6378-61780-0015 IT WAS NOT THE BATTERIE OF SMALL ARMS THAT KEPT ZEB STUMP FROM SHOWING HIMSELF HE HAD NO DREAD OF AN ENCOUNTER WITH THE EX OFFICER OF VOLUNTEERS THOUGH HE INSTINCTIVELY FELT HOSTILITY HE HAD AS YET GIVEN NO REASON TO THE LATTER FOR REGARDING HIM AS AN ENEMY
6378-61780-0016 HE REMAINED IN SHADOW TO HAVE A BETTER VIEW OF WHAT WAS PASSING UNDER THE SUNLIGHT STILL CLOSELY SCRUTINISING THE TRAIL OF THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN CALHOUN TROTTED PAST
6378-61780-0017 INTERPOSED ITS VERDANT VEIL BETWEEN HIM AND THE EX CAPTAIN OF CAVALRY THE BACKWOODSMAN'S BRAIN HAVING BECOME THE RECIPIENT OF NEW THOUGHTS REQUIRED A FRESH EXERCISE OF ITS INGENUITY IF THERE WAS REASON BEFORE FOR TAKING THE TRAIL OF THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN IT WAS REDOUBLED NOW
6378-61780-0018 WITH BUT SHORT TIME SPENT IN CONSIDERATION SO ZEB CONCLUDED AND COMMENCED MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR A STALK AFTER CASSIUS CALHOUN THESE CONSISTED IN TAKING HOLD OF THE BRIDLE AND GIVING THE OLD MARE A KICK THAT CAUSED HER TO START INSTANTANEOUSLY TO HER FEET
6378-61780-0019 ZEB STOOD BY HER SIDE INTENDING TO CLIMB INTO THE SADDLE AND RIDE OUT INTO THE OPEN PLAIN AS SOON AS CALHOUN SHOULD BE OUT OF SIGHT HE HAD NO THOUGHTS OF KEEPING THE LATTER IN VIEW HE NEEDED NO SUCH GUIDANCE THE TWO FRESH TRAILS WOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR HIM
6378-61780-0020 AND HE FELT AS SURE OF FINDING THE DIRECTION IN WHICH BOTH WOULD LEAD AS IF HE HAD RIDDEN ALONGSIDE THE HORSEMAN WITHOUT A HEAD OR HIM WITHOUT A HEART
6378-61780-0021 FOR ONCE IN HIS LIFE ZEB STUMP HAD MADE A MISTAKE ON ROUNDING THE MEZQUITE GROVE BEHIND WHICH BOTH HAD MADE DISAPPEARANCE HE DISCOVERED HE HAD DONE SO BEYOND EXTENDED A TRACT OF CHALK PRAIRIE OVER WHICH ONE OF THE HORSEMEN APPEARED TO HAVE PASSED HIM WITHOUT THE HEAD
6378-61780-0022 IN TRANSVERSE STRETCHES LIKE A POINTER QUARTERING THE STUBBLE IN SEARCH OF A PARTRIDGE HE TOO HAD LOST THE TRAIL AND WAS ENDEAVOURING TO RECOVER IT CROUCHING UNDER COVER OF THE MEZQUITES THE HUNTER REMAINED A SILENT SPECTATOR OF HIS MOVEMENTS THE ATTEMPT TERMINATED IN A FAILURE
6378-61780-0023 THE CHALK SURFACE DEFIED INTERPRETATION AT LEAST BY SKILL SUCH AS THAT OF CASSIUS CALHOUN AFTER REPEATED QUARTERINGS HE APPEARED TO SURRENDER HIS DESIGN AND ANGRILY PLYING THE SPUR GALLOPED OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE LEONA
6378-61780-0024 AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT ZEB ALSO MADE AN EFFORT TO TAKE UP THE LOST TRAIL BUT DESPITE HIS SUPERIOR ATTAINMENTS IN THE TRACKING CRAFT HE WAS COMPELLED TO RELINQUISH IT A FERVID SUN WAS GLARING DOWN UPON THE CHALK AND ONLY THE EYE OF A SALAMANDER COULD HAVE WITHSTOOD THE REFLECTION OF ITS RAYS
6378-61780-0025 DAZED ALMOST TO BLINDNESS THE BACKWOODSMAN DETERMINED UPON TURNING LATE BACK AND ONCE MORE DEVOTING HIS ATTENTION TO THE TRAIL FROM WHICH HE HAD BEEN FOR A TIME SEDUCED HE HAD LEARNT ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THIS LAST PROMISED A RICH REWARD FOR ITS EXPLORATION
6378-61780-0026 IT TOOK HIM BUT A SHORT TIME TO REGAIN IT NOR DID HE LOSE ANY IN FOLLOWING IT UP HE WAS TOO KEENLY IMPRESSED WITH ITS VALUE AND WITH THIS IDEA URGING HIM HE STRODE RAPIDLY ON THE MARE FOLLOWING AS BEFORE ONCE ONLY DID HE MAKE PAUSE
6378-61780-0027 AT A POINT WHERE THE TRACKS OF TWO HORSES CONVERGED WITH THAT HE WAS FOLLOWING FROM THIS POINT THE THREE COINCIDED AT TIMES PARTING AND RUNNING PARALLEL FOR A SCORE OF YARDS OR SO BUT AGAIN COMING TOGETHER AND OVERLAPPING ONE ANOTHER THE HORSES WERE ALL SHOD
6378-61780-0028 LIKE THAT WHICH CARRIED THE BROKEN SHOE AND THE HUNTER ONLY STOPPED TO SEE WHAT HE COULD MAKE OUT OF THE HOOF MARKS ONE WAS A STATES HORSE THE OTHER A MUSTANG THOUGH A STALLION OF GREAT SIZE AND WITH A HOOF ALMOST AS LARGE AS THAT OF THE AMERICAN ZEB HAD HIS CONJECTURES ABOUT BOTH
6378-61780-0029 HE DID NOT STAY TO INQUIRE WHICH HAD GONE FIRST OVER THE GROUND THAT WAS AS CLEAR TO HIM AS IF HE HAD BEEN A SPECTATOR AT THEIR PASSING THE STALLION HAD BEEN IN THE LEAD HOW FAR ZEB COULD NOT EXACTLY TELL BUT CERTAINLY SOME DISTANCE BEYOND THAT OF COMPANIONSHIP
6378-61780-0030 THE STATES HORSE HAD FOLLOWED AND BEHIND HIM THE ROADSTER WITH THE BROKEN SHOE ALSO AN AMERICAN ALL THREE HAD GONE OVER THE SAME GROUND AT SEPARATE TIMES AND EACH BY HIMSELF
6378-61780-0031 AS ONE MIGHT READ THE INDEX OF A DIAL OR THERMOMETER WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN IN HIS THOUGHTS HE SAID NOTHING BEYOND GIVING UTTERANCE TO THE SIMPLE EXCLAMATION GOOD AND WITH SATISFACTION STAMPED UPON HIS FEATURES HE MOVED ON THE OLD MARE APPEARING TO MOCK HIM BY AN IMITATIVE STRIDE
6378-61780-0032 HYUR THEY'VE SEPPURATED HE SAID ONCE AGAIN COMING TO A STOP AND REGARDING THE GROUND AT HIS FEET
6378-61780-0033 THET AIR THEY'VE TUK THE SAME WAY BROKEN SHOE HEV STRAYED IN A DIFFRENT DIREKSHUN WONDER NOW WHAT THET'S FOR HE CONTINUED AFTER STANDING AWHILE TO CONSIDER DURN ME EF I IVER SEED SECH PERPLEXIN SIGN IT UD PUZZLE OLE DAN'L BOONE HISSELF
6378-61780-0034 WHICH ON EM SHED I FOLLER FUST EF I GO ARTER THE TWO I KNOW WHAR THEY'LL LEAD
6378-61780-0035 LET'S TRACK UP TOTHER AND SEE WHETHER HE HEV RUD INTO THE SAME PROCKSIMMUTY
6378-61780-0036 ELSE YE MAY GET LOST IN THE CHAPPARAL AN THE COYOATS MAY MAKE THUR SUPPER ON YUR TALLOW HO HO HO WITH THIS APOSTROPHE TO HIS CRITTER ENDING IN A LAUGH AT THE CONCEIT OF HER TALLOW THE HUNTER TURNED OFF ON THE TRACK OF THE THIRD HORSE
6378-61780-0037 IT LED HIM ALONG THE EDGE OF AN EXTENDED TRACT OF CHAPPARAL WHICH FOLLOWING ALL THREE HE HAD APPROACHED AT A POINT WELL KNOWN TO HIM AS TO THE READER WHERE IT WAS PARTED BY THE OPEN SPACE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE NEW TRAIL SKIRTED THE TIMBER ONLY FOR A SHORT DISTANCE
6378-61780-0038 TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE EMBOUCHURE OF THE AVENUE IT RAN INTO IT AND FIFTY PACES FURTHER ON
6378-61780-0039 ZEB SAW THAT THE ANIMAL HAD PROCEEDED NO FURTHER FOR THERE WAS ANOTHER SET OF TRACKS SHOWING WHERE IT HAD RETURNED TO THE PRAIRIE THOUGH NOT BY THE SAME PATH THE RIDER HAD GONE BEYOND THE FOOT MARKS OF A MAN COULD BE SEEN BEYOND IN THE MUD OF A HALF DRY ARROYO
6378-61780-0040 BESIDE WHICH THE HORSE HAD BEEN HITCHED LEAVING HIS CRITTER TO OCCUPY THE STALL WHERE BROKEN SHOE HAD FOR SOME TIME FRETTED HIMSELF THE OLD HUNTER GLIDED OFF UPON THE FOOTMARKS OF THE DISMOUNTED RIDER HE SOON DISCOVERED TWO SETS OF THEM ONE GOING ANOTHER COMING BACK
6378-61780-0041 HE FOLLOWED THE FORMER HE WAS NOT SURPRISED AT THEIR BRINGING HIM OUT INTO THE AVENUE CLOSE TO THE POOL OF BLOOD BY THE COYOTES LONG SINCE LICKED DRY HE MIGHT HAVE TRACED THEM RIGHT UP TO IT BUT FOR THE HUNDREDS OF HORSE TRACKS THAT HAD TRODDEN THE GROUND LIKE A SHEEP PEN
6378-61780-0042 BUT BEFORE GOING SO FAR HE WAS STAYED BY THE DISCOVERY OF SOME FRESH SIGN TOO INTERESTING TO BE CARELESSLY EXAMINED IN A PLACE WHERE THE UNDERWOOD GREW THICK HE CAME UPON A SPOT WHERE A MAN HAD REMAINED FOR SOME TIME
6378-61780-0043 THERE WAS NO TURF AND THE LOOSE MOULD WAS BAKED HARD AND SMOOTH EVIDENTLY BY THE SOLE OF A BOOT OR SHOE THERE WERE PRINTS OF THE SAME SOLE LEADING OUT TOWARDS THE PLACE OF BLOOD AND SIMILAR ONES COMING BACK AGAIN BUT UPON THE BRANCHES OF A TREE BETWEEN
6378-61780-0044 ZEB STUMP SAW SOMETHING THAT HAD ESCAPED THE EYES NOT ONLY OF THE SEARCHERS BUT OF THEIR GUIDE SPANGLER A SCRAP OF PAPER BLACKENED AND HALF BURNT EVIDENTLY THE WADDING OF A DISCHARGED GUN IT WAS CLINGING TO THE TWIG OF A LOCUST TREE IMPALED UPON ONE OF ITS SPINES
