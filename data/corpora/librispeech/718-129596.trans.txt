718-129596-0000 AMONG THE CHIPS SCATTERED ABOUT THE BEACH LAY THE TWO AXES THAT HAD BEEN USED TO CHOP UP THE BOATS THE TIDE WAS CREEPING IN BEHIND ME THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT COURAGE I LOOKED SQUARELY INTO THE FACES OF THE ADVANCING MONSTERS
718-129596-0001 ONE KNELT THEN THE OTHER TWO I TURNED AND WALKED TOWARDS THE DEAD BODIES KEEPING MY FACE TOWARDS THE THREE KNEELING BEAST MEN VERY MUCH AS AN ACTOR PASSING UP THE STAGE FACES THE AUDIENCE THEY BROKE THE LAW SAID I PUTTING MY FOOT ON THE SAYER OF THE LAW
718-129596-0002 THEY HAVE BEEN SLAIN EVEN THE SAYER OF THE LAW EVEN THE OTHER WITH THE WHIP GREAT IS THE LAW COME AND SEE NONE ESCAPE SAID ONE OF THEM ADVANCING AND PEERING NONE ESCAPE SAID I THEREFORE HEAR AND DO AS I COMMAND
718-129596-0003 THEY STOOD UP LOOKING QUESTIONINGLY AT ONE ANOTHER STAND THERE SAID I I PICKED UP THE HATCHETS AND SWUNG THEM BY THEIR HEADS FROM THE SLING OF MY ARM TURNED MONTGOMERY OVER PICKED UP HIS REVOLVER STILL LOADED IN TWO CHAMBERS
718-129596-0004 BUT STILL MORE AFRAID OF MY CRACKING RED WHIP LASH AND AFTER SOME FUMBLING AND HESITATION SOME WHIP CRACKING AND SHOUTING THEY LIFTED HIM GINGERLY CARRIED HIM DOWN TO THE BEACH AND WENT SPLASHING INTO THE DAZZLING WELTER OF THE SEA ON SAID I
718-129596-0005 ON CARRY HIM FAR THEY WENT IN UP TO THEIR ARMPITS AND STOOD REGARDING ME LET GO SAID I AND THE BODY OF MONTGOMERY VANISHED WITH A SPLASH SOMETHING SEEMED TO TIGHTEN ACROSS MY CHEST GOOD SAID I WITH A BREAK IN MY VOICE
718-129596-0006 AND THEY CAME BACK HURRYING AND FEARFUL TO THE MARGIN OF THE WATER LEAVING LONG WAKES OF BLACK IN THE SILVER AT THE WATER'S EDGE THEY STOPPED TURNING AND GLARING INTO THE SEA AS THOUGH THEY PRESENTLY EXPECTED MONTGOMERY TO ARISE THEREFROM AND EXACT VENGEANCE
718-129596-0007 I HEARD A LIGHT FOOTFALL BEHIND ME AND TURNING QUICKLY SAW THE BIG HYENA SWINE PERHAPS A DOZEN YARDS AWAY HIS HEAD WAS BENT DOWN HIS BRIGHT EYES WERE FIXED UPON ME HIS STUMPY HANDS CLENCHED AND HELD CLOSE BY HIS SIDE
718-129596-0008 HE STOPPED IN THIS CROUCHING ATTITUDE WHEN I TURNED HIS EYES A LITTLE AVERTED FOR A MOMENT WE STOOD EYE TO EYE
718-129596-0009 AT THE FIRST EXCUSE IT MAY SEEM TREACHEROUS BUT SO I WAS RESOLVED I WAS FAR MORE AFRAID OF HIM THAN OF ANY OTHER TWO OF THE BEAST FOLK HIS CONTINUED LIFE WAS I KNEW A THREAT AGAINST MINE
718-129596-0010 I WAS PERHAPS A DOZEN SECONDS COLLECTING MYSELF THEN CRIED I SALUTE BOW DOWN HIS TEETH FLASHED UPON ME IN A SNARL WHO ARE YOU THAT I SHOULD
718-129596-0011 I HEARD HIM YELP SAW HIM RUN SIDEWAYS AND TURN KNEW I HAD MISSED AND CLICKED BACK THE COCK WITH MY THUMB FOR THE NEXT SHOT BUT HE WAS ALREADY RUNNING HEADLONG JUMPING FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND I DARED NOT RISK ANOTHER MISS
718-129596-0012 EVERY NOW AND THEN HE LOOKED BACK AT ME OVER HIS SHOULDER HE WENT SLANTING ALONG THE BEACH AND VANISHED BENEATH THE DRIVING MASSES OF DENSE SMOKE THAT WERE STILL POURING OUT FROM THE BURNING ENCLOSURE FOR SOME TIME I STOOD STARING AFTER HIM
718-129596-0013 A DREADFUL THING THAT I WAS ONLY BEGINNING TO REALISE WAS THAT OVER ALL THIS ISLAND THERE WAS NOW NO SAFE PLACE WHERE I COULD BE ALONE AND SECURE TO REST OR SLEEP I HAD RECOVERED STRENGTH AMAZINGLY SINCE MY LANDING BUT I WAS STILL INCLINED TO BE NERVOUS AND TO BREAK DOWN UNDER ANY GREAT STRESS
718-129596-0014 BUT MY HEART FAILED ME I WENT BACK TO THE BEACH AND TURNING EASTWARD PAST THE BURNING ENCLOSURE MADE FOR A POINT WHERE A SHALLOW SPIT OF CORAL SAND RAN OUT TOWARDS THE REEF HERE I COULD SIT DOWN AND THINK
718-129596-0015 AND THERE I SAT CHIN ON KNEES THE SUN BEATING DOWN UPON MY HEAD AND UNSPEAKABLE DREAD IN MY MIND PLOTTING HOW I COULD LIVE ON AGAINST THE HOUR OF MY RESCUE IF EVER RESCUE CAME
718-129596-0016 MY THOUGHTS WERE DISTURBED BY A CRYING OF SEA BIRDS HURRYING TOWARDS SOME BLACK OBJECT THAT HAD BEEN STRANDED BY THE WAVES ON THE BEACH NEAR THE ENCLOSURE I KNEW WHAT THAT OBJECT WAS BUT I HAD NOT THE HEART TO GO BACK AND DRIVE THEM OFF
718-129596-0017 I BEGAN WALKING ALONG THE BEACH IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION DESIGNING TO COME ROUND THE EASTWARD CORNER OF THE ISLAND AND SO APPROACH THE RAVINE OF THE HUTS WITHOUT TRAVERSING THE POSSIBLE AMBUSCADES OF THE THICKETS
718-129596-0018 PERHAPS HALF A MILE ALONG THE BEACH I BECAME AWARE OF ONE OF MY THREE BEAST FOLK ADVANCING OUT OF THE LANDWARD BUSHES TOWARDS ME I WAS NOW SO NERVOUS WITH MY OWN IMAGININGS THAT I IMMEDIATELY DREW MY REVOLVER
718-129596-0019 HE HESITATED AS HE APPROACHED GO AWAY CRIED I
718-129596-0020 IT RETREATED A LITTLE WAY VERY LIKE A DOG BEING SENT HOME AND STOPPED LOOKING AT ME IMPLORINGLY WITH CANINE BROWN EYES
718-129596-0021 NO GO AWAY I INSISTED AND SNAPPED MY WHIP
718-129596-0022 AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE HOUSE OF PAIN HAD AFFECTED THEM I KNOW NOW THE FOLLY OF MY COWARDICE
718-129596-0023 TOWARDS NOON CERTAIN OF THEM CAME AND SQUATTED BASKING IN THE HOT SAND THE IMPERIOUS VOICES OF HUNGER AND THIRST PREVAILED OVER MY DREAD I CAME OUT OF THE BUSHES AND REVOLVER IN HAND WALKED DOWN TOWARDS THESE SEATED FIGURES ONE A WOLF WOMAN TURNED HER HEAD AND STARED AT ME
718-129596-0024 AND THEN THE OTHERS NONE ATTEMPTED TO RISE OR SALUTE ME I FELT TOO FAINT AND WEARY TO INSIST AND I LET THE MOMENT PASS I WANT FOOD SAID I ALMOST APOLOGETICALLY AND DRAWING NEAR THERE IS FOOD IN THE HUTS SAID AN OX BOAR MAN
718-129596-0025 DROWSILY AND LOOKING AWAY FROM ME I PASSED THEM AND WENT DOWN INTO THE SHADOW AND ODOURS OF THE ALMOST DESERTED RAVINE IN AN EMPTY HUT I FEASTED ON SOME SPECKED AND HALF DECAYED FRUIT AND THEN AFTER I HAD PROPPED SOME BRANCHES AND STICKS ABOUT THE OPENING
718-129596-0026 THE EXHAUSTION OF THE LAST THIRTY HOURS CLAIMED ITS OWN AND I FELL INTO A LIGHT SLUMBER
