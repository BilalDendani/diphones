8825-292252-0000 IT IS A MELANCHOLY OF MINE OWN COMPOUNDED OF MANY SIMPLES EXTRACTED FROM MANY OBJECTS AND INDEED THE SUNDRY CONTEMPLATION OF MY TRAVELS IN WHICH MY OFTEN RUMINATION WRAPS ME IN A MOST HUMOROUS SADNESS
8825-292252-0001 I HAVE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BEEN TO THE SHAKESPEARE COUNTRY APPROACHING IT FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS BUT EACH TIME I AM SET DOWN AT LEAMINGTON PERHAPS THIS IS BY SOME ACT OF PARLIAMENT I REALLY DO NOT KNOW
8825-292252-0002 ANYWAY I HAVE CEASED TO KICK AGAINST THE PRICKS AND NOW MEEKLY ACCEPT MY FATE LEAMINGTON SEEMS LARGELY UNDER SUBJECTION TO THAT TRIUMVIRATE OF DESPOTS THE BUTLER THE COACHMAN AND THE GARDENER
8825-292252-0003 YOU HEAR THE JINGLE OF KEYS THE FLICK OF THE WHIP AND THE RATTLE OF THE LAWNMOWER AND A COLD SECRET FEAR TAKES POSSESSION OF YOU A SORT OF HALF FRENZIED IMPULSE TO FLEE BEFORE SMUG MODERNITY TAKES YOU CAPTIVE AND WHISKS YOU OFF TO PLAY TIDDLEDYWINKS
8825-292252-0004 OR TO DANCE THE RACQUET BUT THE TRAM IS AT THE DOOR THE OUTSIDE FARE IS A PENNY INSIDE IT'S TWO AND WE ARE SOON SAFE
8825-292252-0005 WARWICK IS WORTH OUR WHILE FOR HERE WE SEE SCENES SUCH AS SHAKESPEARE SAW AND OUR DELIGHT IS IN THE THINGS THAT HIS EYES BEHELD AT THE FOOT OF MILL STREET ARE THE RUINS OF THE OLD GOTHIC BRIDGE THAT LEADS OFF TO BANBURY
8825-292252-0006 AND WHEN I SAW THAT SIGN AND POINTING FINGER I FELT LIKE LEAVING ALL AND FLYING THENCE JUST BEYOND THE BRIDGE SETTLED SNUGLY IN A FOREST OF WAVING BRANCHES WE SEE STORIED OLD WARWICK CASTLE WITH CAESAR'S TOWER LIFTING ITSELF FROM THE MASS OF GREEN
8825-292252-0007 ALL ABOUT ARE QUAINT OLD HOUSES AND SHOPS WITH RED TILED ROOFS AND LITTLE WINDOWS WITH DIAMOND PANES HUNG ON HINGES WHERE MAIDENS FAIR HAVE LOOKED DOWN ON BRAVE MEN IN COATS OF MAIL
8825-292252-0008 THESE NARROW STONY STREETS HAVE RUNG WITH THE CLANG AND ECHO OF HURRYING HOOFS THE TRAMP OF ROYALIST AND PARLIAMENTARIAN HORSE AND FOOT DRUM AND BANNER THE STIR OF PRINCELY VISITS
8825-292252-0009 OF MAIL COACH MARKET ASSIZE AND KINGLY COURT COLBRAND ARMED WITH GIANT CLUB SIR GUY RICHARD NEVILLE KINGMAKER AND HIS BARBARIC TRAIN ALL TROD THESE STREETS WATERED THEIR HORSES IN THIS RIVER
8825-292252-0010 CAMPED ON YONDER BANK OR HUDDLED IN THIS CASTLE YARD AND AGAIN THEY CAME BACK WHEN WILL SHAKESPEARE A YOUTH FROM STRATFORD EIGHT MILES AWAY CAME HERE AND WAVED HIS MAGIC WAND
8825-292252-0011 WARWICK CASTLE IS PROBABLY IN BETTER CONDITION NOW THAN IT WAS IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY BUT PRACTICALLY IT IS THE SAME IT IS THE ONLY CASTLE IN ENGLAND WHERE THE PORTCULLIS IS LOWERED AT TEN O'CLOCK EVERY NIGHT AND RAISED IN THE MORNING
8825-292252-0012 IF THE COAST HAPPENS TO BE CLEAR TO TAP OF DRUM IT COSTS A SHILLING TO VISIT THE CASTLE A FINE OLD SOLDIER IN SPOTLESS UNIFORM WITH WAXED WHITE MOUSTACHE AND DANGLING SWORD CONDUCTS THE VISITORS
8825-292252-0013 HE IMPARTS FULL TWO SHILLINGS WORTH OF FACTS AS WE GO ALL WITH A FIERCE ROLL OF R'S AS BECOMES A MAN OF WAR THE LONG LINE OF BATTLEMENTS THE MASSIVE BUTTRESSES THE ANGULAR ENTRANCE CUT THROUGH SOLID ROCK
8825-292252-0014 CROOKED ABRUPT WITH PLACES WHERE FIGHTING MEN CAN LIE IN AMBUSH ALL IS AS SHAKESPEARE KNEW IT THERE ARE THE CEDARS OF LEBANON BROUGHT BY CRUSADERS FROM THE EAST AND THE SCREAMING PEACOCKS IN THE PAVED COURTWAY AND
8825-292252-0015 IN THE GREAT HALL ARE TO BE SEEN THE SWORD AND ACCOUTERMENTS OF THE FABLED GUY THE MACE OF THE KINGMAKER THE HELMET OF CROMWELL AND THE ARMOR OF LORD BROOKE KILLED AT LITCHFIELD AND THAT SHAKESPEARE SAW THESE THINGS THERE IS NO DOUBT
8825-292252-0016 BUT HE SAW THEM AS A COUNTRYMAN WHO CAME ON CERTAIN FETE DAYS AND STARED WITH OPEN MOUTH WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE HE HAS COVERED ALL WITH THE GLAMOUR OF HIS RICH BOYISH IMAGINATION
8825-292252-0017 THAT FAILED TO PERCEIVE THE CRUEL MOCKERY OF SUCH SELFISH PAGEANTRY HAD HIS VIEW BEEN FROM THE INSIDE HE WOULD NOT HAVE MADE HIS KINGS NOBLE NOR HIS PRINCES GENEROUS
8825-292252-0018 AND FROM HIS BRAIN THE DAZZLING PICTURES WOULD HAVE FLED YET HIS FANCIES SERVE US BETTER THAN THE FACTS SHAKESPEARE SHOWS US MANY CASTLES
8825-292252-0019 WHEN HE PICTURES MACBETH'S CASTLE HE HAS WARWICK IN HIS INWARD EYE THIS CASTLE HATH A PLEASANT SEAT THE AIR NIMBLY AND SWEETLY RECOMMENDS ITSELF UNTO OUR GENTLE SENSES
8825-292252-0020 THIS GUEST OF SUMMER THE TEMPLE HAUNTING MARTLET DOES APPROVE BY HIS LOVED MANSIONRY THAT THE HEAVEN'S BREATH SMELLS WOOINGLY HERE NO JUTTY FRIEZE BUTTRESS NOR COIGN OF VANTAGE BUT THIS BIRD HATH MADE HIS PENDENT BED
8825-292252-0021 AND PROCREANT CRADLE WHERE THEY MOST BREED AND HAUNT I HAVE OBSERVED THE AIR IS DELICATE FIVE MILES FROM WARWICK TEN IF YOU BELIEVE THE CAB DRIVERS ARE THE RUINS OF KENILWORTH CASTLE
8825-292252-0022 IN FIFTEEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE WHEN SHAKESPEARE WAS ELEVEN YEARS OF AGE QUEEN ELIZABETH CAME TO KENILWORTH WHETHER HER TICKET WAS BY WAY OF LEAMINGTON I DO NOT KNOW BUT SHE REMAINED FROM JULY NINTH TO JULY TWENTY SEVENTH
8825-292252-0023 AND THERE WERE GREAT DOINGS MOST EVERY DAY TO WHICH THE YEOMANRY WERE OFT INVITED JOHN SHAKESPEARE WAS A WORTHY CITIZEN OF WARWICKSHIRE AND IT IS VERY PROBABLE THAT HE RECEIVED AN INVITATION AND THAT HE DROVE OVER WITH MARY ARDEN HIS WIFE
8825-292252-0024 SITTING ON THE FRONT SEAT HOLDING THE BABY AND ALL THE OTHER SEVEN CHILDREN SITTING ON THE STRAW BEHIND AND WE MAY BE SURE THAT THE ELDEST BOY IN THAT BROOD NEVER FORGOT THE DAY
8825-292252-0025 IN FACT IN MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM HE HAS CALLED ON HIS MEMORY FOR CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE SHOW ELIZABETH WAS FORTY ONE YEARS OLD THEN BUT APPARENTLY VERY ATTRACTIVE AND GLIB OF TONGUE
8825-292252-0026 NO DOUBT KENILWORTH WAS STUPENDOUS IN ITS MAGNIFICENCE AND IT WILL PAY YOU TO TAKE DOWN FROM ITS SHELF SIR WALTER'S NOVEL AND READ ABOUT IT BUT TODAY IT IS ALL A CRUMBLING HEAP IVY ROOKS AND DAWS HOLD THE PLACE IN FEE
8825-292252-0027 EACH PUSHING HARD FOR SOLE POSSESSION IT IS EIGHT MILES FROM WARWICK TO STRATFORD BY THE DIRECT ROAD BUT TEN BY THE RIVER I HAVE WALKED BOTH ROUTES AND CONSIDER THE LATTER THE SHORTER TWO MILES DOWN THE RIVER IS BARFORD
8825-292252-0028 AND A MILE FARTHER IS WASPERTON WITH ITS QUAINT OLD STONE CHURCH IT IS A GOOD PLACE TO REST FOR NOTHING IS SO SOOTHING AS A COOL CHURCH WHERE THE DIM LIGHT STREAMS THROUGH COLORED WINDOWS AND OUT OF SIGHT SOMEWHERE AN ORGAN SOFTLY PLAYS
8825-292252-0029 SOON AFTER LEAVING THE CHURCH A RUSTIC SWAIN HAILED ME AND ASKED FOR A MATCH THE PIPE AND THE VIRGINIA WEED THEY MEAN AMITY THE WORLD OVER IF I HAD QUESTIONS TO ASK NOW WAS THE TIME SO I ASKED
8825-292252-0030 AND RUSTICUS INFORMED ME THAT HAMPTON LUCY WAS ONLY A MILE BEYOND AND THAT SHAKESPEARE NEVER STOLE DEER AT ALL SO I HOPE WE SHALL HEAR NO MORE OF THAT LIBELOUS ACCUSATION BUT DID SHAKESPEARE RUN AWAY I DEMANDED
8825-292252-0031 AND COME TO THINK OF IT RUSTICUS IS RIGHT MOST GREAT MEN HAVE AT SOME TIME DEPARTED HASTILY WITHOUT LEAVING ORDERS WHERE TO FORWARD THEIR MAIL INDEED IT SEEMS NECESSARY THAT A MAN SHOULD HAVE RUN AWAY AT LEAST ONCE
8825-292252-0032 IN ORDER AFTERWARD TO ATTAIN EMINENCE MOSES LOT TARQUIN PERICLES DEMOSTHENES SAINT PAUL SHAKESPEARE ROUSSEAU VOLTAIRE GOLDSMITH HUGO BUT THE LIST IS TOO LONG TO GIVE
8825-292252-0033 BUT JUST SUPPOSE THAT SHAKESPEARE HAD NOT RUN AWAY AND TO WHOM DO WE OWE IT THAT HE DID LEAVE JUSTICE SHALLOW OR ANN HATHAWAY OR BOTH I SHOULD SAY TO ANN FIRST AND HIS HONOR SECOND
8825-292252-0034 I THINK IF SHAKESPEARE COULD WRITE AN ARTICLE FOR THE LADIES HOME JOURNAL ON WOMEN WHO HAVE HELPED ME AND TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH AS NO MAN EVER WILL IN PRINT HE WOULD PUT ANN HATHAWAY FIRST
8825-292252-0035 HE SIGNED A BOND WHEN EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD AGREEING TO MARRY HER SHE WAS TWENTY SIX NO RECORD IS FOUND OF THE MARRIAGE BUT WE SHOULD THINK OF HER GRATEFULLY FOR NO DOUBT IT WAS SHE WHO STARTED THE LAD OFF FOR LONDON
8825-292252-0036 THAT'S THE WAY I EXPRESSED IT TO MY NEW FOUND FRIEND AND HE AGREED WITH ME SO WE SHOOK HANDS AND PARTED CHARLCOTE IS AS FAIR AS A DREAM OF PARADISE
8825-292252-0037 PAST THE BRIGHT RED BRICK PILE OF CHARLCOTE MANSION THE RIVER BANK IS LINED WITH RUSHES AND IN ONE PLACE I SAW THE PRONGS OF ANTLERS SHAKING THE ELDERS
8825-292252-0038 I SENT A SHRILL WHISTLE AND A STICK THAT WAY AND OUT RAN FOUR FINE DEER THAT LOPED GRACEFULLY ACROSS THE TURF THE SIGHT BROUGHT MY POACHER INSTINCTS TO THE SURFACE BUT I BOTTLED THEM AND TRUDGED ON UNTIL I CAME TO THE LITTLE CHURCH THAT STANDS AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE PARK
8825-292252-0039 ALL MANSIONS CASTLES AND PRISONS IN ENGLAND HAVE CHAPELS OR CHURCHES ATTACHED AND THIS IS WELL FOR IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS IT SEEMED WISE TO KEEP IN CLOSE COMMUNICATION WITH THE OTHER WORLD FOR OFTEN ON SHORT NOTICE
8825-292252-0040 OR IF HE DID NOT GO HIMSELF HE COMPELLED OTHERS TO DO SO AND WHO BUT A BRUTE WOULD KILL A MAN WITHOUT BENEFIT OF THE CLERGY SO EACH ESTATE HIRED ITS PRIESTS BY THE YEAR JUST AS MEN WITH A TASTE FOR LITIGATION HOLD ATTORNEYS IN CONSTANT RETAINER
8825-292252-0041 IN CHARLCOTE CHURCH IS A MEMORIAL TO SIR THOMAS LUCY AND THERE IS A GLOWING EPITAPH THAT QUITE UPSETS ANY OF THOSE TAUNTING AND DEFAMING ALLUSIONS IN THE MERRY WIVES
8825-292252-0042 AT THE FOOT OF THE MONUMENT IS A LINE TO THE EFFECT THAT THE INSCRIPTION THEREON WAS WRITTEN BY THE ONLY ONE IN POSSESSION OF THE FACTS SIR THOMAS HIMSELF SEVERAL EPITAPHS IN THE CHURCHYARD ARE WORTHY OF SPACE IN YOUR COMMONPLACE BOOK
8825-292252-0043 STRUCK ME AS HAVING THE TRUE RING FAREWELL PROUD VAIN FALSE TREACHEROUS WORLD WE HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF THEE WE VALUE NOT WHAT THOU CANST SAY OF WE
8825-292252-0044 WHEN THE CHARLCOTE MANSION WAS BUILT THERE WAS A HOUSEWARMING AND GOOD QUEEN BESS WHO WAS NOT SO AWFUL GOOD CAME IN GREAT STATE SO WE SEE THAT SHE HAD VARIOUS CALLING ACQUAINTANCES IN THESE PARTS
8825-292252-0045 BUT WE HAVE NO PROOF THAT SHE EVER KNEW THAT ANY SUCH PERSON AS W SHAKESPEARE LIVED HOWEVER SHE CAME TO CHARLCOTE AND DINED ON VENISON AND WHAT A PITY IT IS THAT SHE AND SHAKESPEARE DID NOT MEET IN LONDON AFTERWARD AND TALK IT OVER
8825-292252-0046 SOME HASTY INDIVIDUAL HAS PUT FORTH A STATEMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT POETS CAN ONLY BE BRED IN A MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY WHERE THEY COULD LIFT UP THEIR EYES TO THE HILLS ROCK AND RAVINE BEETLING CRAG SINGING CASCADE
8825-292252-0047 AND THE HEIGHTS WHERE THE LIGHTNING PLAYS AND THE MISTS HOVER ARE CERTAINLY GOOD TIMBER FOR POETRY AFTER YOU HAVE CAUGHT YOUR POET BUT NATURE ELUDES ALL FORMULA AGAIN IT IS THE HUMAN INTEREST THAT ADDS VITALITY TO ART
