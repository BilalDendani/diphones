398-123602-0000 IT WAS A LONG TIME AFTER THIS
398-123602-0001 WHERE NOTHING STOLE AWAY THE SHORTEST MINUTE I HAD LOST MYSELF COMPLETELY IN WORK WHEN I HEARD FOOTSTEPS OUTSIDE THERE WAS A STEEP FOOTPATH BETWEEN THE UPPER AND THE LOWER ROAD WHICH I CLIMBED TO SHORTEN THE WAY AS THE CHILDREN HAD TAUGHT ME
398-123602-0002 BUT I BELIEVED THAT MISSUS TODD WOULD FIND IT INACCESSIBLE UNLESS SHE HAD OCCASION TO SEEK ME IN GREAT HASTE I WROTE ON FEELING LIKE A BESIEGED MISER OF TIME WHILE THE FOOTSTEPS CAME NEARER
398-123602-0003 AND THE SHEEP BELL TINKLED AWAY IN HASTE AS IF SOMEONE HAD SHAKEN A STICK IN ITS WEARER'S FACE THEN I LOOKED AND SAW CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE PASSING THE NEAREST WINDOW THE NEXT MOMENT HE TAPPED POLITELY AT THE DOOR COME IN SIR
398-123602-0004 I SAID RISING TO MEET HIM AND HE ENTERED BOWING WITH MUCH COURTESY I STEPPED DOWN FROM THE DESK AND OFFERED HIM A CHAIR BY THE WINDOW WHERE HE SEATED HIMSELF AT ONCE BEING SADLY SPENT BY HIS CLIMB
398-123602-0005 I RETURNED TO MY FIXED SEAT BEHIND THE TEACHER'S DESK WHICH GAVE HIM THE LOWER PLACE OF A SCHOLAR YOU OUGHT TO HAVE THE PLACE OF HONOR CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE I SAID A HAPPY RURAL SEAT OF VARIOUS VIEWS
398-123602-0006 HE QUOTED AS HE GAZED OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE AND UP THE LONG WOODED SHORE THEN HE GLANCED AT ME AND LOOKED ALL ABOUT HIM AS PLEASED AS A CHILD MY QUOTATION WAS FROM PARADISE LOST THE GREATEST OF POEMS
398-123602-0007 HE COPIED LIFE BUT YOU HAVE TO PUT UP WITH A GREAT DEAL OF LOW TALK I NOW REMEMBERED THAT MISSUS TODD HAD TOLD ME ONE DAY THAT CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE HAD OVERSET HIS MIND WITH TOO MUCH READING
398-123602-0008 I COULD NOT HELP WONDERING WHAT ERRAND HAD BROUGHT HIM OUT IN SEARCH OF ME THERE WAS SOMETHING QUITE CHARMING IN HIS APPEARANCE IT WAS A FACE THIN AND DELICATE WITH REFINEMENT BUT WORN INTO APPEALING LINES
398-123602-0009 AS IF HE HAD SUFFERED FROM LONELINESS AND MISAPPREHENSION HE LOOKED WITH HIS CAREFUL PRECISION OF DRESS AS IF HE WERE THE OBJECT OF CHERISHING CARE ON THE PART OF ELDERLY UNMARRIED SISTERS
398-123602-0010 WHO WOULD HAVE NO SUCH STANDARDS
398-123602-0011 HE SAT LOOKING AT ME EXPECTANTLY I COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT WITH HIS QUEER HEAD AND LENGTH OF THINNESS HE WAS MADE TO HOP ALONG THE ROAD OF LIFE
398-123602-0012 HE HAD THE REFINEMENT OF LOOK AND AIR OF COMMAND WHICH ARE THE HERITAGE OF THE OLD ECCLESIASTICAL FAMILIES OF NEW ENGLAND BUT AS DARWIN SAYS IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY THERE IS NO SUCH KING AS A SEA CAPTAIN
398-123602-0013 HE IS GREATER EVEN THAN A KING OR A SCHOOLMASTER CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE MOVED HIS CHAIR OUT OF THE WAKE OF THE SUNSHINE AND STILL SAT LOOKING AT ME I BEGAN TO BE VERY EAGER TO KNOW UPON WHAT ERRAND HE HAD COME
398-123602-0014 THOSE WHO HAVE LAUGHED AT ME LITTLE KNOW HOW MUCH REASON MY IDEAS ARE BASED UPON HE WAVED HIS HAND TOWARD THE VILLAGE BELOW
398-123602-0015 THEY FANCY THAT THEY COMPREHEND THE UNIVERSE I SMILED AND WAITED FOR HIM TO GO ON
398-123602-0016 THE GREATER PART OF MY LIFE FORTY THREE YEARS IN ALL YOU MAY NOT THINK IT BUT I AM ABOVE EIGHTY YEARS OF AGE
398-123602-0017 I SAID I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SERVICEABLE
398-123602-0018 MY EXPERIENCE UPON A CERTAIN OCCASION I MIGHT SAY
398-123602-0019 ONE OF THE GREATEST DISCOVERIES THAT MAN HAS EVER MADE NOW WE WERE APPROACHING DANGEROUS GROUND BUT A SUDDEN SENSE OF HIS SUFFERINGS AT THE HANDS OF THE IGNORANT CAME TO MY HELP AND I ASKED TO HEAR MORE WITH ALL THE DEFERENCE I REALLY FELT
398-123602-0020 AND BEAT ITSELF AGAINST THE WALLS FOR A MINUTE AND ESCAPED AGAIN TO THE OPEN AIR BUT CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE TOOK NO NOTICE WHATEVER OF THE FLURRY I HAD A VALUABLE CARGO
398-123602-0021 AND WHEN I MADE PORT AT LAST IT WAS TOO LATE TO DELAY IN THOSE NORTHERN WATERS WITH SUCH A VESSEL AND SUCH A CREW AS I HAD
398-123602-0022 THEY CARED FOR NOTHING AND IDLED ME INTO A FIT OF SICKNESS BUT MY FIRST MATE WAS A GOOD EXCELLENT MAN WITH NO MORE IDEA OF BEING FROZEN IN THERE UNTIL SPRING THAN I HAD SO
398-123602-0023 WE MADE WHAT SPEED WE COULD TO GET CLEAR OF HUDSON'S BAY AND OFF THE COAST I OWNED AN EIGHTH OF THE VESSEL AND HE OWNED A SIXTEENTH OF HER SHE WAS A FULL RIGGED SHIP CALLED THE MINERVA BUT SHE WAS GETTING OLD AND LEAKY
398-123602-0024 AND SO IT PROVED SHE HAD BEEN AN EXCELLENT VESSEL IN HER DAY OF THE COWARDS ABOARD HER I CAN'T SAY SO MUCH THEN YOU WERE WRECKED I ASKED AS HE MADE A LONG PAUSE
398-123602-0025 I WA'N'T CAUGHT ASTERN O THE LIGHTER
398-123602-0026 WITH A LIGHT PAIR O HEELS BUT I HAD BEEN VEXED TO DEATH WITH THEIR RED TAPE RIGGING AT THE COMPANY'S OFFICE AND CHILLED WITH STAYIN ON DECK AN TRYIN TO HURRY UP THINGS AND WHEN WE WERE WELL OUT O SIGHT O LAND
398-123602-0027 HEADIN FOR HUDSON'S STRAITS I HAD A BAD TURN O SOME SORT O FEVER AND HAD TO STAY BELOW THE DAYS WERE GETTING SHORT AND WE MADE GOOD RUNS ALL WELL ON BOARD BUT ME
398-123602-0028 AND THE CREW DONE THEIR WORK BY DINT OF HARD DRIVING I BEGAN TO FIND THIS UNEXPECTED NARRATIVE A LITTLE DULL CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE SPOKE WITH A KIND OF SLOW CORRECTNESS THAT LACKED THE LONGSHORE HIGH FLAVOR TO WHICH I HAD GROWN USED
398-123602-0029 BUT I LISTENED RESPECTFULLY WHILE HE EXPLAINED THE WINDS HAVING BECOME CONTRARY AND TALKED ON IN A DREARY SORT OF WAY ABOUT HIS VOYAGE THE BAD WEATHER AND THE DISADVANTAGES HE WAS UNDER IN THE LIGHTNESS OF HIS SHIP WHICH BOUNCED ABOUT LIKE A CHIP IN A BUCKET
398-123602-0030 AND WOULD NOT ANSWER THE RUDDER OR PROPERLY RESPOND TO THE MOST CAREFUL SETTING OF SAILS SO THERE WE WERE BLOWIN ALONG ANYWAYS HE COMPLAINED
398-123602-0031 THAT MY THOUGHTS WERE UNKINDLY WANDERING HE CEASED TO SPEAK
398-123602-0032 FOR JUST THAT CLASS O MEN
398-123602-0033 I VIEW IT IN ADDITION THAT A COMMUNITY NARROWS DOWN AND GROWS DREADFUL IGNORANT WHEN IT IS SHUT UP TO ITS OWN AFFAIRS AND GETS NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD
398-123602-0034 EXCEPT FROM A CHEAP UNPRINCIPLED NEWSPAPER IN THE OLD DAYS A GOOD PART O THE BEST MEN HERE KNEW A HUNDRED PORTS AND SOMETHING OF THE WAY FOLKS LIVED IN THEM THEY SAW THE WORLD FOR THEMSELVES
398-123602-0035 AND LIKE'S NOT THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN SAW IT WITH THEM
398-123602-0036 BUT THEY WERE SOME ACQUAINTED WITH FOREIGN LANDS AN THEIR LAWS AN COULD SEE OUTSIDE THE BATTLE FOR TOWN CLERK HERE IN DUNNET THEY GOT SOME SENSE O PROPORTION YES THEY LIVED MORE DIGNIFIED AND THEIR HOUSES WERE BETTER WITHIN AN WITHOUT
398-123602-0037 SHIPPING'S A TERRIBLE LOSS TO THIS PART O NEW ENGLAND FROM A SOCIAL POINT O VIEW MA'AM I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT MYSELF I RETURNED
398-123602-0038 COMPANY'S SAKE IN DULL DAYS AND NIGHTS HE TURNS TO HIS BOOK MOST OF US OLD SHIPMASTERS CAME TO KNOW MOST EVERYTHING ABOUT SOMETHING
398-123602-0039 AND SOME WERE GREAT ON MEDICINE
398-123602-0040 TO THE POETS I WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH A SHIPMASTER THAT WAS ALL FOR BEES AN BEEKEEPIN AND IF YOU MET HIM IN PORT AND WENT ABOARD HE'D SIT
398-123602-0041 AND TALK A TERRIBLE WHILE ABOUT THEIR HAVIN SO MUCH INFORMATION AND THE MONEY THAT COULD BE MADE OUT OF KEEPIN EM HE WAS ONE OF THE SMARTEST CAPTAINS
398-123602-0042 A GREAT BARK HE COMMANDED FOR MANY YEARS TUTTLE'S BEEHIVE THERE WAS OLD CAP'N JAMESON HE HAD NOTIONS OF SOLOMON'S TEMPLE AND MADE A VERY HANDSOME LITTLE MODEL OF THE SAME
398-123602-0043 RIGHT FROM THE SCRIPTURE MEASUREMENTS SAME'S OTHER SAILORS MAKE LITTLE SHIPS AND DESIGN NEW TRICKS OF RIGGING
398-123602-0044 THESE BICYCLES OFFEND ME DREADFULLY THEY DON'T AFFORD NO REAL OPPORTUNITIES OF EXPERIENCE SUCH AS A MAN GAINED ON A VOYAGE NO WHEN FOLKS LEFT HOME IN THE OLD DAYS THEY LEFT IT TO SOME PURPOSE
398-123602-0045 AND WHEN THEY GOT HOME THEY STAYED THERE AND HAD SOME PRIDE IN IT
398-123602-0046 WE'RE ALL TURNED UPSIDE DOWN AND GOING BACK YEAR BY YEAR OH NO CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE I HOPE NOT SAID I TRYING TO SOOTHE HIS FEELINGS THERE WAS A SILENCE IN THE SCHOOLHOUSE
398-123602-0047 BUT WE COULD HEAR THE NOISE OF THE WATER ON A BEACH BELOW IT SOUNDED LIKE THE STRANGE WARNING WAVE THAT GIVES NOTICE OF THE TURN OF THE TIDE
