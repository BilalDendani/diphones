3835-178030-0000 IT IS NATURAL FOR US WHO WERE NOT LIVING IN THOSE DAYS TO IMAGINE THAT WHEN HALF RUSSIA HAD BEEN CONQUERED AND THE INHABITANTS WERE FLEEING TO DISTANT PROVINCES AND ONE LEVY AFTER ANOTHER WAS BEING RAISED FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE FATHERLAND
3835-178030-0001 ALL RUSSIANS FROM THE GREATEST TO THE LEAST WERE SOLELY ENGAGED IN SACRIFICING THEMSELVES
3835-178030-0002 OR WEEPING OVER ITS DOWNFALL THE TALES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THAT TIME WITHOUT EXCEPTION SPEAK ONLY OF THE SELF SACRIFICE PATRIOTIC DEVOTION DESPAIR GRIEF AND THE HEROISM OF THE RUSSIANS BUT IT WAS NOT REALLY SO
3835-178030-0003 IT APPEARS SO TO US BECAUSE WE SEE ONLY THE GENERAL HISTORIC INTEREST OF THAT TIME AND DO NOT SEE ALL THE PERSONAL HUMAN INTERESTS THAT PEOPLE HAD
3835-178030-0004 YET IN REALITY THOSE PERSONAL INTERESTS OF THE MOMENT SO MUCH TRANSCEND THE GENERAL INTERESTS THAT THEY ALWAYS PREVENT THE PUBLIC INTEREST FROM BEING FELT OR EVEN NOTICED MOST OF THE PEOPLE AT THAT TIME PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE GENERAL PROGRESS OF EVENTS
3835-178030-0005 BUT WERE GUIDED ONLY BY THEIR PRIVATE INTERESTS AND THEY WERE THE VERY PEOPLE WHOSE ACTIVITIES AT THAT PERIOD WERE MOST USEFUL THOSE WHO TRIED TO UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL COURSE OF EVENTS AND TO TAKE PART IN IT BY SELF SACRIFICE AND HEROISM
3835-178030-0006 WERE THE MOST USELESS MEMBERS OF SOCIETY THEY SAW EVERYTHING UPSIDE DOWN AND ALL THEY DID FOR THE COMMON GOOD TURNED OUT TO BE USELESS AND FOOLISH LIKE PIERRE'S AND MAMONOV'S REGIMENTS WHICH LOOTED RUSSIAN VILLAGES AND THE LINT THE YOUNG LADIES PREPARED
3835-178030-0007 EVEN THOSE FOND OF INTELLECTUAL TALK AND OF EXPRESSING THEIR FEELINGS WHO DISCUSSED RUSSIA'S POSITION AT THE TIME INVOLUNTARILY INTRODUCED INTO THEIR CONVERSATION EITHER A SHADE OF PRETENSE AND FALSEHOOD
3835-178030-0008 OR USELESS CONDEMNATION AND ANGER DIRECTED AGAINST PEOPLE ACCUSED OF ACTIONS NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY BE GUILTY OF IN HISTORIC EVENTS THE RULE FORBIDDING US TO EAT OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE IS SPECIALLY APPLICABLE
3835-178030-0009 ONLY UNCONSCIOUS ACTION BEARS FRUIT AND HE WHO PLAYS A PART IN AN HISTORIC EVENT NEVER UNDERSTANDS ITS SIGNIFICANCE IF HE TRIES TO REALIZE IT HIS EFFORTS ARE FRUITLESS
3835-178030-0010 THE MORE CLOSELY A MAN WAS ENGAGED IN THE EVENTS THEN TAKING PLACE IN RUSSIA THE LESS DID HE REALIZE THEIR SIGNIFICANCE IN PETERSBURG AND IN THE PROVINCES AT A DISTANCE FROM MOSCOW
3835-178030-0011 WEPT FOR RUSSIA AND ITS ANCIENT CAPITAL AND TALKED OF SELF SACRIFICE AND SO ON BUT IN THE ARMY WHICH RETIRED BEYOND MOSCOW THERE WAS LITTLE TALK OR THOUGHT OF MOSCOW
3835-178030-0012 AND WHEN THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF ITS BURNED RUINS NO ONE SWORE TO BE AVENGED ON THE FRENCH BUT THEY THOUGHT ABOUT THEIR NEXT PAY THEIR NEXT QUARTERS OF MATRESHKA THE VIVANDIERE AND LIKE MATTERS AS THE WAR HAD CAUGHT HIM IN THE SERVICE
3835-178030-0013 NICHOLAS ROSTOV TOOK A CLOSE AND PROLONGED PART IN THE DEFENSE OF HIS COUNTRY BUT DID SO CASUALLY WITHOUT ANY AIM AT SELF SACRIFICE AND HE THEREFORE LOOKED AT WHAT WAS GOING ON IN RUSSIA WITHOUT DESPAIR AND WITHOUT DISMALLY RACKING HIS BRAINS OVER IT
3835-178030-0014 HAD HE BEEN ASKED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE STATE OF RUSSIA HE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT IT WAS NOT HIS BUSINESS TO THINK ABOUT IT THAT KUTUZOV AND OTHERS WERE THERE FOR THAT PURPOSE BUT THAT HE HAD HEARD THAT THE REGIMENTS WERE TO BE MADE UP TO THEIR FULL STRENGTH
3835-178030-0015 THAT FIGHTING WOULD PROBABLY GO ON FOR A LONG TIME YET AND THAT THINGS BEING SO IT WAS QUITE LIKELY HE MIGHT BE IN COMMAND OF A REGIMENT IN A COUPLE OF YEARS TIME AS HE LOOKED AT THE MATTER IN THIS WAY
3835-178030-0016 REMOUNTS FOR HIS DIVISION NOT ONLY WITHOUT REGRET AT BEING PREVENTED FROM TAKING PART IN THE COMING BATTLE BUT WITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE WHICH HE DID NOT CONCEAL AND WHICH HIS COMRADES FULLY UNDERSTOOD A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE BATTLE OF BORODINO
3835-178030-0017 NICHOLAS RECEIVED THE NECESSARY MONEY AND WARRANTS AND HAVING SENT SOME HUSSARS ON IN ADVANCE HE SET OUT WITH POST HORSES FOR VORONEZH ONLY A MAN WHO HAS EXPERIENCED IT THAT IS HAS PASSED SOME MONTHS CONTINUOUSLY
3835-178030-0018 CAN UNDERSTAND THE DELIGHT NICHOLAS FELT WHEN HE ESCAPED FROM THE REGION COVERED BY THE ARMY'S FORAGING OPERATIONS PROVISION TRAINS AND HOSPITALS WHEN FREE FROM SOLDIERS WAGONS AND THE FILTHY TRACES OF A CAMP
3835-178030-0019 HE SAW VILLAGES WITH PEASANTS AND PEASANT WOMEN GENTLEMEN'S COUNTRY HOUSES FIELDS WHERE CATTLE WERE GRAZING POSTHOUSES WITH STATIONMASTERS ASLEEP IN THEM HE REJOICED AS THOUGH SEEING ALL THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME
3835-178030-0020 WHAT FOR A LONG WHILE SPECIALLY SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED HIM WERE THE WOMEN YOUNG AND HEALTHY WITHOUT A DOZEN OFFICERS MAKING UP TO EACH OF THEM WOMEN TOO WHO WERE PLEASED AND FLATTERED THAT A PASSING OFFICER SHOULD JOKE WITH THEM
3835-178030-0021 ORDERED THINGS HE HAD LONG BEEN DEPRIVED OF IN CAMP AND NEXT DAY VERY CLEAN SHAVEN AND IN A FULL DRESS UNIFORM HE HAD NOT WORN FOR A LONG TIME WENT TO PRESENT HIMSELF TO THE AUTHORITIES
3835-178030-0022 THE COMMANDER OF THE MILITIA WAS A CIVILIAN GENERAL AN OLD MAN WHO WAS EVIDENTLY PLEASED WITH HIS MILITARY DESIGNATION AND RANK HE RECEIVED NICHOLAS BRUSQUELY IMAGINING THIS TO BE CHARACTERISTICALLY MILITARY AND QUESTIONED HIM WITH AN IMPORTANT AIR
3835-178030-0023 AS IF CONSIDERING THE GENERAL PROGRESS OF AFFAIRS AND APPROVING AND DISAPPROVING WITH FULL RIGHT TO DO SO NICHOLAS WAS IN SUCH GOOD SPIRITS THAT THIS MERELY AMUSED HIM FROM THE COMMANDER OF THE MILITIA HE DROVE TO THE GOVERNOR
3835-178030-0024 THE GOVERNOR WAS A BRISK LITTLE MAN VERY SIMPLE AND AFFABLE HE INDICATED THE STUD FARMS AT WHICH NICHOLAS MIGHT PROCURE HORSES RECOMMENDED TO HIM A HORSE DEALER IN THE TOWN AND A LANDOWNER FOURTEEN MILES OUT OF TOWN WHO HAD THE BEST HORSES AND PROMISED TO ASSIST HIM IN EVERY WAY
3835-178030-0025 MY WIFE WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF YOUR MOTHER'S WE ARE AT HOME ON THURSDAYS TODAY IS THURSDAY SO PLEASE COME AND SEE US QUITE INFORMALLY SAID THE GOVERNOR TAKING LEAVE OF HIM IMMEDIATELY ON LEAVING THE GOVERNOR'S NICHOLAS HIRED POST HORSES AND
3835-178030-0026 TAKING HIS SQUADRON QUARTERMASTER WITH HIM DROVE AT A GALLOP TO THE LANDOWNER FOURTEEN MILES AWAY WHO HAD THE STUD EVERYTHING SEEMED TO HIM PLEASANT AND EASY DURING THAT FIRST PART OF HIS STAY IN VORONEZH AND AS USUALLY HAPPENS WHEN A MAN IS IN A PLEASANT STATE OF MIND
3835-178030-0027 EVERYTHING WENT WELL AND EASILY THE LANDOWNER TO WHOM NICHOLAS WENT WAS A BACHELOR AN OLD CAVALRYMAN A HORSE FANCIER A SPORTSMAN THE POSSESSOR OF SOME CENTURY OLD BRANDY AND SOME OLD HUNGARIAN WINE WHO HAD A SNUGGERY WHERE HE SMOKED
3835-178030-0028 AND WHO OWNED SOME SPLENDID HORSES IN VERY FEW WORDS NICHOLAS BOUGHT SEVENTEEN PICKED STALLIONS FOR SIX THOUSAND RUBLES TO SERVE AS HE SAID AS SAMPLES OF HIS REMOUNTS AFTER DINING AND TAKING RATHER TOO MUCH OF THE HUNGARIAN WINE
3835-178030-0029 NICHOLAS HAVING EXCHANGED KISSES WITH THE LANDOWNER WITH WHOM HE WAS ALREADY ON THE FRIENDLIEST TERMS GALLOPED BACK OVER ABOMINABLE ROADS IN THE BRIGHTEST FRAME OF MIND CONTINUALLY URGING ON THE DRIVER SO AS TO BE IN TIME FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PARTY
3835-178030-0030 WHEN HE HAD CHANGED POURED WATER OVER HIS HEAD AND SCENTED HIMSELF NICHOLAS ARRIVED AT THE GOVERNOR'S RATHER LATE BUT WITH THE PHRASE BETTER LATE THAN NEVER ON HIS LIPS IT WAS NOT A BALL NOR HAD DANCING BEEN ANNOUNCED
3835-178030-0031 WOULD PLAY VALSES AND THE ECOSSAISE
3835-178030-0032 AND SO EVERYONE HAD COME AS TO A BALL PROVINCIAL LIFE IN EIGHTEEN TWELVE WENT ON VERY MUCH AS USUAL BUT WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT IT WAS LIVELIER IN THE TOWNS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE ARRIVAL OF MANY WEALTHY FAMILIES FROM MOSCOW
3835-178030-0033 AND AS IN EVERYTHING THAT WENT ON IN RUSSIA AT THAT TIME A SPECIAL RECKLESSNESS WAS NOTICEABLE AN IN FOR A PENNY IN FOR A POUND WHO CARES SPIRIT AND THE INEVITABLE SMALL TALK INSTEAD OF TURNING ON THE WEATHER AND MUTUAL ACQUAINTANCES
3835-178030-0034 NOW TURNED ON MOSCOW THE ARMY AND NAPOLEON THE SOCIETY GATHERED TOGETHER AT THE GOVERNOR'S WAS THE BEST IN VORONEZH
3835-178030-0035 BUT THERE WERE NO MEN WHO COULD AT ALL VIE WITH THE CAVALIER OF SAINT GEORGE THE HUSSAR REMOUNT OFFICER THE GOOD NATURED AND WELL BRED COUNT ROSTOV AMONG THE MEN WAS AN ITALIAN PRISONER AN OFFICER OF THE FRENCH ARMY
3835-178030-0036 AND NICHOLAS FELT THAT THE PRESENCE OF THAT PRISONER ENHANCED HIS OWN IMPORTANCE AS A RUSSIAN HERO THE ITALIAN WAS AS IT WERE A WAR TROPHY NICHOLAS FELT THIS IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT EVERYONE REGARDED THE ITALIAN IN THE SAME LIGHT
3835-178030-0037 AND HE TREATED HIM CORDIALLY THOUGH WITH DIGNITY AND RESTRAINT AS SOON AS NICHOLAS ENTERED IN HIS HUSSAR UNIFORM DIFFUSING AROUND HIM A FRAGRANCE OF PERFUME AND WINE AND HAD UTTERED THE WORDS BETTER LATE THAN NEVER AND HEARD THEM REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES BY OTHERS
3835-178030-0038 PEOPLE CLUSTERED AROUND HIM ALL EYES TURNED ON HIM AND HE FELT AT ONCE THAT HE HAD ENTERED INTO HIS PROPER POSITION IN THE PROVINCE THAT OF A UNIVERSAL FAVORITE A VERY PLEASANT POSITION AND INTOXICATINGLY SO AFTER HIS LONG PRIVATIONS
3835-178030-0039 AT POSTING STATIONS AT INNS AND IN THE LANDOWNER'S SNUGGERY MAIDSERVANTS HAD BEEN FLATTERED BY HIS NOTICE AND HERE TOO AT THE GOVERNOR'S PARTY THERE WERE AS IT SEEMED TO NICHOLAS AN INEXHAUSTIBLE NUMBER OF PRETTY YOUNG WOMEN MARRIED AND UNMARRIED
3835-178030-0040 IMPATIENTLY AWAITING HIS NOTICE THE WOMEN AND GIRLS FLIRTED WITH HIM AND FROM THE FIRST DAY THE PEOPLE CONCERNED THEMSELVES TO GET THIS FINE YOUNG DAREDEVIL OF AN HUSSAR MARRIED AND SETTLED DOWN AMONG THESE WAS THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE HERSELF
3835-178030-0041 WHO WELCOMED ROSTOV AS A NEAR RELATIVE AND CALLED HIM NICHOLAS
3835-178030-0042 AND DANCING BEGAN IN WHICH NICHOLAS STILL FURTHER CAPTIVATED THE PROVINCIAL SOCIETY BY HIS AGILITY HIS PARTICULARLY FREE MANNER OF DANCING EVEN SURPRISED THEM ALL NICHOLAS WAS HIMSELF RATHER SURPRISED AT THE WAY HE DANCED THAT EVENING
3835-178030-0043 HE HAD NEVER DANCED LIKE THAT IN MOSCOW AND WOULD EVEN HAVE CONSIDERED SUCH A VERY FREE AND EASY MANNER IMPROPER AND IN BAD FORM BUT HERE HE FELT IT INCUMBENT ON HIM TO ASTONISH THEM ALL BY SOMETHING UNUSUAL
3835-178030-0044 SOMETHING THEY WOULD HAVE TO ACCEPT AS THE REGULAR THING IN THE CAPITAL THOUGH NEW TO THEM IN THE PROVINCES ALL THE EVENING NICHOLAS PAID ATTENTION TO A BLUE EYED PLUMP AND PLEASING LITTLE BLONDE THE WIFE OF ONE OF THE PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS
3835-178030-0045 WITH THE NAIVE CONVICTION OF YOUNG MEN IN A MERRY MOOD THAT OTHER MEN'S WIVES WERE CREATED FOR THEM
3835-178030-0046 AS IF WITHOUT SPEAKING OF IT THEY KNEW HOW CAPITALLY NICHOLAS AND THE LADY WOULD GET ON TOGETHER THE HUSBAND HOWEVER DID NOT SEEM TO SHARE THAT CONVICTION AND TRIED TO BEHAVE MOROSELY WITH ROSTOV
