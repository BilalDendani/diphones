7700-92925-0000 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE PROBABLY THE GREATEST HERO IN ALL GREAT BRITAIN'S NAVAL HISTORY IS SIR FRANCIS DRAKE WHO CARRIED ENGLAND'S FLAG TO THE UTTERMOST CORNERS OF THE EARTH AND MADE IT GLORIOUS WHEN QUEEN ELIZABETH WAS ON THE ENGLISH THRONE
7700-92925-0001 DRAKE WAS THE OLDEST OF A FAMILY OF TWELVE SONS AND WAS BORN IN DEVONSHIRE IN FIFTEEN THIRTY NINE HE WAS AN ACTIVE AND ADVENTUROUS BOY FOND OF ALL ATHLETIC GAMES AND EARLY SHOWING A TASTE FOR THE SEA
7700-92925-0002 THAT SEEMED TO RUN IN HIS FAMILY FOR HIS FATHER HAD SERVED IN THE NAVY IN THE TIME OF HENRY THE EIGHTH AND HIS COUSIN SIR JOHN HAWKINS WAS SAILING TO THE COAST OF GUINEA TO BRING BACK SLAVES THE TALENT THAT DRAKE HAD FOR THE SEA
7700-92925-0003 WAS SOON OBSERVED BY THE KEEN EYED HAWKINS AND BEFORE LONG DRAKE BECAME HIS APPRENTICE AND QUICKLY LEARNED THE INS AND OUTS OF SEAMANSHIP HE RAPIDLY MADE A NAME FOR HIMSELF AS A BRAVE AND SKILFUL SAILOR
7700-92925-0004 AND BEFORE LONG ACCOMPANIED HAWKINS ON HIS TRIPS TO GUINEA AFTER NEGRO SLAVES TRIPS IN WHICH DRAKE WAS ALWAYS IN THE FORE WHEN ANY ADVENTURE OF A PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS NATURE WAS UNDERTAKEN
7700-92925-0005 THE SLAVE TRADE WAS A PERFECTLY HONORABLE CALLING IN THOSE DAYS AND DRAKE SUCCEEDED IN IT BEYOND HIS HOPES AMASSING MUCH MONEY WITH WHICH HE HELPED HIS YOUNGER BROTHERS AND DID MANY KINDNESSES FOR HIS FAMILY
7700-92925-0006 BUT THE SLAVE TRADE ITSELF SOON GREW TOO SMALL TO SATISFY HAWKINS WHO SOUGHT A FIELD FOR BROADER ADVENTURES ALL THE WESTERN OCEAN LAY OPEN TO HIM
7700-92925-0007 AND MUSTERING A SQUADRON HE OFFERED DRAKE THE COMMAND OF ONE OF THE VESSELS WHICH WERE TO GO TO THE WEST INDIES AND ENGAGE IN TRADING OR FIGHTING WITH THE SPANIARDS WHO HAD AT THAT TIME ALMOST A MONOPOLY OF THE WATERS WHERE COLUMBUS HAD SAILED
7700-92925-0008 SOME SEVENTY YEARS BEFORE SPAIN AND ENGLAND WERE NOT OPENLY AT WAR WHEN HAWKINS WAS PLANNING THIS VOYAGE BUT IN UNKNOWN WATERS ALL LAW STOPPED AND IT WAS NOT INFREQUENT FOR SPANISH AND ENGLISH VESSELS TO FALL AFOUL OF EACH OTHER
7700-92925-0009 WITH LITTLE OR NOTHING SAID ABOUT IT AFTERWARD IN THE COURTS OR EMBASSIES QUEEN ELIZABETH HATED THE SPANIARDS AND WAS GLAD TO DO THEM ALL THE MISCHIEF SHE COULD BUT SHE DID NOT DARE TO GO TO WAR WITH THEM AT THAT TIME
7700-92925-0010 OR TO GIVE TOO OPEN ENCOURAGEMENT TO HER SEA CAPTAINS THEY KNEW NONE THE LESS THAT THE SIGHT OF SPANISH GOLD UNDER ENGLISH HATCHES WAS PLEASANT TO GOOD QUEEN BESS AND LIKELY TO RESULT IN HONOR WEALTH AND PREFERMENT FOR THEMSELVES
7700-92925-0011 IT WAS ON DRAKE'S FIRST EXPEDITION TO THE WEST INDIES THAT HE CONCEIVED A HATRED FOR THE SPANIARDS THAT WAS TO LAST ALL HIS LIFE AS THE RESULT OF THE BLACK TREACHERY THEY PLAYED ON HAWKINS
7700-92925-0012 AFTER CRUISING ALONG THE WESTERN COAST OF WHAT IS NOW FLORIDA AND BEING UNABLE TO FIND A PROPER HARBOR THERE HAWKINS SET SAIL FOR MEXICO AND DROPPED ANCHOR AT A SPANISH PORT IN THAT COUNTRY
7700-92925-0013 A LARGE FLEET OF SPANISH VESSELS ARRIVED AND FINDING THE ENGLISH IN POSSESSION AND HOLDING A STRONG POSITION AGREED TO LET THEM SAIL AWAY UNMOLESTED LATER HOWEVER
7700-92925-0014 WHEN THE ENGLISH HAD CONSENTED TO THESE TERMS AND AFTER THE SPANISH ADMIRAL HAD ENTERTAINED THE ENGLISH OFFICERS IN HIS OWN CABIN THE SPANIARDS TREACHEROUSLY ATTACKED THE ENGLISH KILLING A NUMBER THAT HAD GONE ASHORE BEFORE THEY COULD REGAIN THEIR BOATS
7700-92925-0015 AND ENGAGING IN A SEA FIGHT WITH HAWKINS SQUADRON IN WHICH THE ENGLISH LOST ALL BUT TWO OF THEIR SHIPS THE JUDITH DRAKE'S VESSEL AND THE MINION ON WHICH HAWKINS HAPPENED TO BE WHEN THE FIGHT COMMENCED
7700-92925-0016 THESE TWO SHIPS ESCAPED AND MADE THEIR WAY BACK TO ENGLAND SEPARATELY DRAKE VOWING VENGEANCE AGAINST THE SPANIARDS AND INDEED THEY HAD MADE A DANGEROUS ENEMY IN THIS BOLD SAILOR WHO VERY SHORTLY
7700-92925-0017 PAID THEM IN FULL FOR THE BASE TREATMENT THEY HAD GIVEN HIM AS SOON AS HE WAS IN ENGLAND DRAKE COMMENCED FITTING OUT TWO VESSELS AS RAIDERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF HARRYING SPANISH SHIPS IN THE WATERS OF THE WEST INDIES
7700-92925-0018 AND IF POSSIBLE TO CAPTURE THE SPANISH HOLDINGS ON LAND AND PLACE THEM BENEATH THE ENGLISH FLAG PARTICULARLY DID HE DESIRE TO GET HIS FINGERS INTO THE RICH HEAPS OF GOLD
7700-92925-0019 THAT WERE CONVEYED BY GREAT SPANISH SHIPS OR GALLEONS BACK FROM THE NEW WORLD TO THE TREASURY OF KING PHILIP WITH THESE ENDS IN VIEW DRAKE LANDED HIS MEN SECRETLY ON THE COAST OF CENTRAL AMERICA NEAR THE PRESENT LOCATION OF THE PANAMA CANAL
7700-92925-0020 AND BY A BOLD SURPRISE ATTACK CAPTURED THE SPANISH TOWN NAMED NOMBRE DE DIOS HE WAS FINALLY COMPELLED TO ABANDON THE TOWN BECAUSE HE WAS GREATLY OUTNUMBERED BY THE SPANIARDS WHO THROUGH A MISHAP IN HIS PLANS
7700-92925-0021 WERE ENABLED TO COLLECT THEIR FORCES
7700-92925-0022 OF CENTRAL AMERICA ALONG THE ROUTE THAT THE TREASURE TRAINS TRAVELED WHEN THE TINKLING OF THE BELLS ON THE HARNESSES OF THE PACK ANIMALS WARNED HIM OF THE APPROACH OF THE SPANIARDS WHO GUARDED THE TREASURE DRAKE CONCEALED HIS MEN AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
7700-92925-0023 AND RUSHING FORWARD WITH A SHOUT ATTACKED AND CAPTURED THE TRAIN ALMOST BEFORE THE ASTONISHED SPANIARDS KNEW THAT THERE WAS AN ENEMY IN THE VICINITY RICH STORES OF GOLD AND JEWELS WERE FOUND IN THE MULE PACKS MORE IN FACT
7700-92925-0024 THAN THE ENGLISH MEN COULD CARRY BACK WITH THEM AND WITH CHEERS AND REJOICING THE LITTLE BAND OF ADVENTURERS MADE THEIR WAY BACK TO THE HARBOR WHERE THEY HAD LEFT THEIR SHIPS WHEN THEY REACHED IT HOWEVER NO SHIPS WERE TO BE SEEN
7700-92925-0025 THEY FEARED THAT THE SPANIARDS HAD CAPTURED OR DESTROYED THEIR VESSELS AND THAT THEY WERE MAROONED IN A HOSTILE AND DANGEROUS COUNTRY BUT DRAKE WITH HIS CHARACTERISTIC BOLDNESS FORMED A PLAN THAT DELIVERED THEM FROM THEIR DIFFICULTY
7700-92925-0026 FROM THE LOGS ON THE SHORE HE ORDERED HIS MEN TO BUILD A RAFT AND WITH THEIR HATCHETS THEY HEWED OUT OARS A SAIL WAS CONTRIVED FROM A LARGE BISCUIT SACK AND WITH A FEW OF HIS BEST MEN
7700-92925-0027 DRAKE PUT TO SEA ON THIS STRANGE CRAFT SEARCHING FOR HIS SHIPS THE RAFT HAD BEEN BUILT SO HURRIEDLY THAT AT TIMES HE WAS UP TO HIS WAIST IN WATER BUT HE WAS REWARDED AT LAST BY FINDING HIS TWO VESSELS
7700-92925-0028 SAFE AND SOUND IN A LITTLE COVE WHERE THEY HAD BEEN TAKEN TO AVOID SOME SPANISH WARSHIPS THAT WERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD RETURNING TO HIS MEN AT THE HELM OF HIS OWN VESSEL THE TREASURE WAS SOON ABOARD
7700-92925-0029 AND WITH A LARGE CARGO OF GOLD SILVER AND SPARKLING JEWELS DRAKE HEADED FOR ENGLAND WHERE A ROUSING WELCOME WAS GIVEN HIM ELIZABETH HOWEVER
7700-92925-0030 DID NOT DARE OPENLY TO APPROVE OF AN ACT THAT SECRETLY BROUGHT HER THE UTMOST SATISFACTION FOR THE TIME AT ANY RATE DRAKE GOT LITTLE THANKS FOR HIS EXPLOITS AND THERE WAS EVEN TALK OF RETURNING THE CAPTURED TREASURE TO THE SPANIARDS
7700-92925-0031 DRAKE THEN ENGAGED IN A WAR IN IRELAND WHERE HE PROVED HIMSELF ALMOST AS GOOD A SOLDIER AS HE WAS A SAILOR BUT EVEN WHILE ENJOYING HIS CONGENIAL OCCUPATION OF FIGHTING HE LONGED TO SET FORTH
7700-92925-0032 ON ANOTHER GREAT ADVENTURE THE IDEA OF WHICH HAD COME TO HIM WHILE IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE FROM WHICH HE HAD FIRST SET EYES ON THE FAR OFF WATERS OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN
7700-92925-0033 TO WATERS WHERE THEY HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE UP TO THAT TIME ONLY THE SPANISH HAD ROUNDED SOUTH AMERICA AND BROUGHT THEIR CIVILIZATION TO ITS NORTHWESTERN SHORES AND THE NEW VENTURE IF SUCCESSFUL WOULD MEAN MUCH TO ENGLAND
7700-92925-0034 BUT DRAKE FEARED THAT THE QUEEN WOULD NOT APPROVE OF THE IDEA AND FOR A TIME CHERISHED IT ONLY IN HIS OWN MIND WAITING A MORE FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY TO LAY IT BEFORE THE QUEEN IN THE MEANTIME
7700-92925-0035 HE FELL IN WITH AN ENGLISH ARMY OFFICER NAMED THOMAS DOUGHTY WHO BECAME HIS CLOSE FRIEND DOUGHTY WAS GREATLY INTERESTED IN DRAKE'S IDEA OF SAILING THE PACIFIC AND PROMISED TO GET SIR CHRISTOPHER HATTON
7700-92925-0036 ONE OF ELIZABETH'S MOST INFLUENTIAL ADVISORS TO INTERCEDE FOR DRAKE WITH THE QUEEN HATTON TALKED WITH DRAKE AND CORDIALLY APPROVED THE PLAN AND
7700-92925-0037 DRAKE SAILED WESTWARD WHILE THE TRUMPETS BLARED AND THE CANNON BOOMED IN HIS HONOR DRAKE HIMSELF WAS IN COMMAND OF A LITTLE SHIP WHICH HE CALLED THE GOLDEN HIND AND DOUGHTY WAS HIS SECOND IN COMMAND
7700-92925-0038 OVER THE ENTIRE SQUADRON THE SHIPS WERE ADMIRABLY FITTED OUT FOR THOSE TIMES WITH EVERY NECESSITY AND EVERY COMFORT AND LUXURY DRAKE AND HIS OFFICERS DINED FROM SILVER DISHES ON THE CHOICEST FOOD AND WINES HIS STORES
7700-92925-0039 INCLUDED MATERIALS FOR TRADING WITH THE NATIVES AS WELL AS ALL THE SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS THEN APPLIED TO THE ART OF NAVIGATION AFTER SINKING SOME UNIMPORTANT SPANISH SHIPS THE ENGLISH SQUADRON CAPTURED A LARGE PORTUGUESE GALLEON
7700-92925-0040 THE PORTUGUESE HAD BEEN UNFRIENDLY TO THE ENGLISH ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION AND THIS WAS DRAKE'S WAY OF INFORMING THEM THAT SUCH HAD BEEN THE CASE AND AFTER A LONG VOYAGE HE CAME TO THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER DE LA PLATA IN SOUTH AMERICA
7700-92925-0041 DROPPING ANCHOR AT THE ENTRANCE TO THAT GREAT STREAM FIRES BLAZED ON THE SHORE AND WEIRD FIGURES WERE SEEN DANCING AROUND THE FLAMES THEY WERE THE SAVAGE NATIVES PRAYING TO THEIR HEATHEN GODS FOR THE SHIPWRECK OF DRAKE'S PARTY
7700-92925-0042 FOR THEY BELIEVED THAT BY THEIR PRAYERS AND FIRES A HOST OF DEVILS WOULD ALIGHT UPON THE ENGLISH VESSELS AND DESTROY THEM DRAKE HIMSELF WAS TOO EAGER TO CONTINUE HIS VOYAGE TO THINK OF LANDING AND POINTED HIS PROWS SOUTHWARD
7700-92925-0043 BOUND FOR THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN AFTER A BATTLE WITH THE GIGANTIC AND SAVAGE PATAGONIANS IN WHICH DRAKE SAVED HIS MEN FROM MASSACRE BY HIS USUAL QUICK DECISION AND ENERGY
7700-92925-0044 HE CONTINUED HIS VOYAGE UNTIL TROUBLE THAT HAD DEVELOPED IN HIS CREW COMPELLED HIM TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST HIS FRIEND AND LIEUTENANT DOUGHTY IT SEEMS THAT EVEN BEFORE THEY SAILED FROM ENGLAND DOUGHTY HAD BECOME JEALOUS OF DRAKE
7700-92925-0045 AND HAD COMMENCED TO WORK FOR HIS UNDOING AND NOW PROOFS WERE ONLY TOO EVIDENT THAT HE HAD TRIED TO PROVOKE A MUTINY IN THE CREW
