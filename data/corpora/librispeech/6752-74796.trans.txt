6752-74796-0000 CHAPTER FIVE WHEN HE WAS GONE AND YOLETTA HAD FOLLOWED LEAVING SOME OF THE OTHERS STILL STUDYING THOSE WRETCHED SOVEREIGNS I SAT DOWN AGAIN AND RESTED MY CHIN ON MY HAND FOR I WAS NOW THINKING DEEPLY THINKING ON THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT
6752-74796-0001 I DARESAY I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN MAKING A PRECIOUS ASS OF MYSELF WAS THE MENTAL REFLECTION THAT OCCURRED TO ME ONE I HAD NOT INFREQUENTLY MADE AND WHAT IS MORE BEEN JUSTIFIED IN MAKING ON FORMER OCCASIONS THEN REMEMBERING THAT I HAD COME TO SUPPER WITH AN EXTRAVAGANT APPETITE
6752-74796-0002 IT STRUCK ME THAT MY HOST QUIETLY OBSERVANT HAD WHEN PROPOSING TERMS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE QUANTITY OF FOOD NECESSARY FOR MY SUSTENANCE I REGRETTED TOO LATE THAT I HAD NOT EXERCISED MORE RESTRAINT BUT THE HUNGRY MAN DOES NOT AND CANNOT CONSIDER CONSEQUENCES
6752-74796-0003 ELSE A CERTAIN HAIRY GENTLEMAN WHO FIGURES IN ANCIENT HISTORY HAD NEVER LENT HIMSELF TO THAT NEFARIOUS COMPACT WHICH GAVE SO GREAT AN ADVANTAGE TO A YOUNGER BUT SLEEK AND WELL NOURISHED BROTHER IN SPITE OF ALL THIS
6752-74796-0004 OCCUPIED WITH THESE REFLECTIONS I HAD FAILED TO OBSERVE THAT THE COMPANY HAD GRADUALLY BEEN DRIFTING AWAY UNTIL BUT ONE PERSON WAS LEFT WITH ME
6752-74796-0005 ON HIS INVITATION I NOW ROSE PUT BY MY MONEY AND FOLLOWED HIM RETURNING BY THE HALL WE WENT THROUGH A PASSAGE AND ENTERED A ROOM OF VAST EXTENT WHICH IN ITS FORM AND GREAT LENGTH AND HIGH ARCHED ROOF WAS LIKE THE NAVE OF A CATHEDRAL AND YET HOW UNLIKE
6752-74796-0006 IN THAT SOMETHING ETHEREAL IN ITS ASPECT AS OF A NAVE IN A CLOUD CATHEDRAL ITS FAR STRETCHING SHINING FLOORS AND WALLS AND COLUMNS PURE WHITE AND PEARL GRAY FAINTLY TOUCHED WITH COLORS OF EXQUISITE DELICACY
6752-74796-0007 AND OVER IT ALL WAS THE ROOF OF WHITE OR PALE GRAY GLASS TINGED WITH GOLDEN RED THE ROOF WHICH I HAD SEEN FROM THE OUTSIDE WHEN IT SEEMED TO ME LIKE A CLOUD RESTING ON THE STONY SUMMIT OF A HILL ON COMING IN I HAD THE IMPRESSION OF AN EMPTY SILENT PLACE
6752-74796-0008 YET THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE WERE ALL THERE THEY WERE SITTING AND RECLINING ON LOW COUCHES SOME LYING AT THEIR EASE ON STRAW MATS ON THE FLOOR SOME WERE READING OTHERS WERE OCCUPIED WITH SOME WORK IN THEIR HANDS
6752-74796-0009 AND SOME WERE CONVERSING THE SOUND COMING TO ME LIKE A FAINT MURMUR FROM A DISTANCE AT ONE SIDE SOMEWHERE ABOUT THE CENTER OF THE ROOM THERE WAS A BROAD RAISED PLACE OR DAIS WITH A COUCH ON IT ON WHICH THE FATHER WAS RECLINING AT HIS EASE
6752-74796-0010 BESIDE THE COUCH STOOD A LECTERN ON WHICH A LARGE VOLUME RESTED AND BEFORE HIM THERE WAS A BRASS BOX OR CABINET AND BEHIND THE COUCH SEVEN POLISHED BRASS GLOBES WERE RANGED SUSPENDED ON AXLES RESTING ON BRONZE FRAMES THESE GLOBES VARIED IN SIZE
6752-74796-0011 THE LARGEST BEING NOT LESS THAN ABOUT TWELVE FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE I NOTICED THAT THERE WERE BOOKS ON A LOW STAND NEAR ME THEY WERE ALL FOLIOS VERY MUCH ALIKE IN FORM AND THICKNESS AND SEEING PRESENTLY THAT THE OTHERS WERE ALL FOLLOWING THEIR OWN INCLINATIONS AND CONSIDERING THAT I HAD BEEN LEFT TO MY OWN RESOURCES
6752-74796-0012 AND THAT IT IS A GOOD PLAN WHEN AT ROME TO DO AS THE ROMANS DO I BY AND BY VENTURED TO HELP MYSELF TO A VOLUME WHICH I CARRIED TO ONE OF THE READING STANDS BOOKS ARE GRAND THINGS SOMETIMES THOUGHT I PREPARED TO FOLLOW THE ADVICE I HAD RECEIVED
6752-74796-0013 AND FIND OUT BY READING ALL ABOUT THE CUSTOMS OF THIS PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THEIR IDEAS CONCERNING THE HOUSE WHICH APPEARED TO BE AN OBJECT OF ALMOST RELIGIOUS REGARD WITH THEM THIS WOULD MAKE ME QUITE INDEPENDENT
6752-74796-0014 AND TEACH ME HOW TO AVOID BLUNDERING IN THE FUTURE OR GIVING EXPRESSION TO ANY MORE EXTRAORDINARY DELUSIONS ON OPENING THE VOLUME I WAS GREATLY SURPRISED TO FIND THAT IT WAS RICHLY ILLUMINATED ON EVERY LEAF
6752-74796-0015 THE MIDDLE ONLY OF EACH PAGE BEING OCCUPIED WITH A RATHER NARROW STRIP OF WRITING BUT THE MINUTE LETTERS RESEMBLING HEBREW CHARACTERS WERE INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME I BORE THE DISAPPOINTMENT VERY CHEERFULLY I MUST SAY
6752-74796-0016 AND BESIDES I COULD NOT HAVE PAID PROPER ATTENTION TO THE TEXT SURROUNDED WITH ALL THAT DISTRACTING BEAUTY OF GRACEFUL DESIGN AND BRILLIANT COLORING
6752-74796-0017 HER FINGERS ENGAGED WITH SOME KIND OF WOOL WORK AS SHE WALKED AND MY HEART BEAT FAST WHEN SHE PAUSED BY MY SIDE YOU ARE NOT READING SHE SAID LOOKING CURIOUSLY AT ME I HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOU FOR SOME TIME HAVE YOU INDEED
6752-74796-0018 SAID I NOT KNOWING WHETHER TO FEEL FLATTERED OR NOT NO UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T READ THIS BOOK AS I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE LETTERS
6752-74796-0019 QUARITCH FOR INSTANCE WOULD BE TEMPTED TO GIVE FOR IT OH I AM FORGETTING
6752-74796-0020 BUT WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BOOK IT IS SHE SAID NOTHING IN REPLY AND ONLY LOOKED A LITTLE SURPRISED DISGUSTED I FEARED AT MY IGNORANCE THEN WALKED AWAY I HAD HOPED THAT SHE WAS GOING TO TALK TO ME AND WITH KEEN DISAPPOINTMENT WATCHED HER MOVING ACROSS THE FLOOR
6752-74796-0021 ALL THE GLORY SEEMED NOW TO HAVE GONE OUT OF THE LEAVES OF THE VOLUME AND I CONTINUED TURNING THEM OVER LISTLESSLY
6752-74796-0022 WONDERFUL TO LOOK AT AND HARD TO UNDERSTAND IN A DISTANT PART OF THE ROOM I SAW HER PLACE SOME CUSHIONS ON THE FLOOR AND SETTLE HERSELF ON THEM TO DO HER WORK THE SUN HAD SET BY THIS TIME AND THE INTERIOR WAS GROWING DARKER BY DEGREES
6752-74796-0023 THE FADING LIGHT HOWEVER SEEMED TO MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO THOSE WHO WORKED OR READ THEY APPEARED TO BE GIFTED WITH AN OWLISH VISION ABLE TO SEE WITH VERY LITTLE LIGHT THE FATHER ALONE DID NOTHING BUT STILL RESTED ON HIS COUCH PERHAPS INDULGING IN A POSTPRANDIAL NAP
6752-74796-0024 AT LENGTH HE ROUSED HIMSELF AND LOOKED AROUND HIM THERE IS NO MELODY IN OUR HEARTS THIS EVENING MY CHILDREN HE SAID WHEN ANOTHER DAY HAS PASSED OVER US IT WILL PERHAPS BE DIFFERENT
6752-74796-0025 TO NIGHT THE VOICE SO RECENTLY STILLED IN DEATH FOREVER WOULD BE TOO PAINFULLY MISSED BY ALL OF US SOME ONE THEN ROSE AND BROUGHT A TALL WAX TAPER AND PLACED IT NEAR HIM THE FLAME THREW A LITTLE BRIGHTNESS ON THE VOLUME
6752-74796-0026 WHICH HE NOW PROCEEDED TO OPEN AND HERE AND THERE FURTHER AWAY IT FLASHED AND TREMBLED IN POINTS OF RAINBOW COLORED LIGHT ON A TALL COLUMN BUT THE GREATER PART OF THE ROOM STILL REMAINED IN TWILIGHT OBSCURITY HE BEGAN TO READ ALOUD
6752-74796-0027 AND ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT SEEM TO RAISE HIS VOICE ABOVE ITS USUAL PITCH
6752-74796-0028 SWEETLY PLAYED IN TUNE THE WORDS HE READ RELATED TO LIFE AND DEATH AND SUCH SOLEMN MATTERS BUT TO MY MIND HIS THEOLOGY SEEMED SOMEWHAT FANTASTICAL ALTHOUGH IT IS RIGHT TO CONFESS THAT I AM NO JUDGE OF SUCH MATTERS
6752-74796-0029 THERE WAS ALSO A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE HOUSE WHICH DID NOT ENLIGHTEN ME MUCH BEING TOO RHAPSODICAL AND WHEN HE SPOKE ABOUT OUR CONDUCT AND AIMS IN LIFE AND THINGS OF THAT KIND I UNDERSTOOD HIM LITTLE BETTER HERE IS A PART OF HIS DISCOURSE
6752-74796-0030 IT IS NATURAL TO GRIEVE FOR THOSE THAT DIE BECAUSE LIGHT AND KNOWLEDGE AND LOVE AND JOY ARE NO LONGER THEIRS BUT THEY GRIEVE NOT ANY MORE BEING NOW ASLEEP ON THE LAP OF THE UNIVERSAL MOTHER
6752-74796-0031 THE BRIDE OF THE FATHER WHO IS WITH US SHARING OUR SORROW WHICH WAS HIS FIRST BUT IT DIMS NOT HIS EVERLASTING BRIGHTNESS AND HIS DESIRE AND OUR GLORY IS THAT WE SHOULD ALWAYS AND IN ALL THINGS RESEMBLE HIM
6752-74796-0032 THE END OF EVERY DAY IS DARKNESS BUT THE FATHER OF LIFE THROUGH OUR REASON HAS TAUGHT US TO MITIGATE THE EXCEEDING BITTERNESS OF OUR END
6752-74796-0033 OTHERWISE WE THAT ARE ABOVE ALL OTHER CREATURES IN THE EARTH SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE LAST MORE MISERABLE THAN THEY FOR IN THE IRRATIONAL WORLD BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT KINDS THERE REIGNS PERPETUAL STRIFE AND BLOODSHED
6752-74796-0034 THE STRONG DEVOURING THE WEAK AND THE INCAPABLE AND WHEN FAILURE OF LIFE CLOUDS THE BRIGHTNESS OF THAT LOWER SOUL WHICH IS THEIRS THE END IS NOT LONG DELAYED THUS THE LIFE THAT HAS LASTED MANY DAYS GOES OUT WITH A BRIEF PANG
6752-74796-0035 AND IN ITS GOING GIVES NEW VIGOR TO THE STRONG THAT HAVE YET MANY DAYS TO LIVE THUS ALSO DOES THE EVER LIVING EARTH FROM THE DUST OF DEAD GENERATIONS OF LEAVES RE MAKE A FRESH FOLIAGE AND FOR HERSELF A NEW GARMENT
6752-74796-0036 WE ONLY OF ALL THINGS HAVING LIFE BEING LIKE THE FATHER SLAY NOT NOR ARE SLAIN AND ARE WITHOUT ENEMIES IN THE EARTH FOR EVEN THE LOWER KINDS WHICH HAVE NOT REASON KNOW WITHOUT REASON THAT WE ARE HIGHEST ON THE EARTH AND
6752-74796-0037 SEE IN US ALONE OF ALL HIS WORKS THE MAJESTY OF THE FATHER AND LOSE ALL THEIR RAGE IN OUR PRESENCE THEREFORE WHEN THE NIGHT IS NEAR WHEN LIFE IS A BURDEN AND WE REMEMBER OUR MORTALITY WE HASTEN THE END
6752-74796-0038 THAT THOSE WE LOVE MAY CEASE TO SORROW AT THE SIGHT OF OUR DECLINE AND WE KNOW THAT THIS IS HIS WILL WHO CALLED US INTO BEING AND GAVE US LIFE AND JOY ON THE EARTH FOR A SEASON BUT NOT FOREVER
6752-74796-0039 IT IS BETTER TO LAY DOWN THE LIFE THAT IS OURS TO LEAVE ALL THINGS THE LOVE OF OUR KINDRED THE BEAUTY OF THE WORLD AND OF THE HOUSE THE LABOR IN WHICH WE TAKE DELIGHT TO GO FORTH AND BE NO MORE
6752-74796-0040 WE REMEMBER THAT OUR LABOR HAS BORNE FRUIT THAT THE LETTERS WE HAVE WRITTEN PERISH NOT WITH US BUT REMAIN AS A TESTIMONY AND A JOY TO SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS AND LIVE IN THE HOUSE FOREVER
6752-74796-0041 FOR THE HOUSE IS THE IMAGE OF THE WORLD AND WE THAT LIVE AND LABOR IN IT ARE THE IMAGE OF OUR FATHER WHO MADE THE WORLD AND LIKE HIM WE LABOR TO MAKE FOR OURSELVES A WORTHY HABITATION WHICH SHALL NOT SHAME OUR TEACHER
6752-74796-0042 THIS IS HIS DESIRE FOR IN ALL HIS WORKS AND THAT KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS LIKE PURE WATER TO ONE THAT THIRSTS AND SATISFIES AND LEAVES NO TASTE OF BITTERNESS ON THE PALATE WE LEARN THE WILL OF HIM THAT CALLED US INTO LIFE
6752-74796-0043 ALL THE KNOWLEDGE WE SEEK THE INVENTION AND SKILL WE POSSESS AND THE LABOR OF OUR HANDS HAS THIS PURPOSE ONLY FOR ALL KNOWLEDGE AND INVENTION AND LABOR HAVING ANY OTHER PURPOSE WHATSOEVER
6752-74796-0044 IS EMPTY AND VAIN IN COMPARISON AND UNWORTHY OF THOSE THAT ARE MADE IN THE IMAGE OF THE FATHER OF LIFE FOR JUST AS THE BODILY SENSES MAY BECOME PERVERTED AND THE TASTE LOSE ITS DISCRIMINATION
6752-74796-0045 SO THAT THE HUNGRY MAN WILL DEVOUR ACRID FRUITS AND POISONOUS HERBS FOR ALIMENT
6752-74796-0046 THUS WE KNOW THAT IN THE PAST MEN SOUGHT AFTER KNOWLEDGE OF VARIOUS KINDS ASKING NOT WHETHER IT WAS FOR GOOD OR FOR EVIL BUT EVERY OFFENSE OF THE MIND AND THE BODY HAS ITS APPROPRIATE REWARD
6752-74796-0047 AND WHILE THEIR KNOWLEDGE GREW APACE THAT BETTER KNOWLEDGE AND DISCRIMINATION WHICH THE FATHER GIVES TO EVERY LIVING SOUL BOTH IN MAN AND IN BEAST WAS TAKEN FROM THEM THUS BY INCREASING THEIR RICHES THEY WERE MADE POORER
6752-74796-0048 AND LIKE ONE WHO FORGETTING THE LIMITS THAT ARE SET TO HIS FACULTIES GAZES STEADFASTLY ON THE SUN BY SEEING MUCH THEY BECOME AFFLICTED WITH BLINDNESS BUT THEY KNOW NOT THEIR POVERTY AND BLINDNESS AND WERE NOT SATISFIED
