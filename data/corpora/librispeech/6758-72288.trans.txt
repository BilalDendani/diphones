6758-72288-0016 AND WITH THE FINGERS OF THE OTHER TENDERLY ARRANGED THE STRAGGLING HAIR ON EACH SIDE OF THE BROW THEN STANDING AND TURNING TO THE REST WITH A SUBDUED VOICE HE SAID MY CHILDREN IT HAS PLEASED THE LORD TO TAKE TO HIMSELF YOUR DEAR MOTHER AND MY FAITHFUL COMPANION
6758-72288-0017 THE LORD'S WILL BE DONE THEN ENSUED A GREAT BURST OF WEEPING AND ANNA'S EYES BRIMMED TILL SHE COULD SEE NO MORE THE CHURCH BELL BEGAN TO TOLL FOR A DEPARTING SPIRIT AND FOLLOWING EACH STROKE THERE CAME TO HER AS THE AFTER CLANG OF THE BOOM

6758-72288-0023 AND HE HAS REBUILT VERY MANY CHURCHES AND DESIGNED MANSIONS FOR THE RICH CITIZENS AND THE NOBLES BUT ALTHOUGH HE IS SUCH A FAMOUS MAN HIS HEART IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE HE NEVER FORGETS THAT HE WAS BORN IN SIEBENSTEIN
6758-72288-0024 LOOK WHAT A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE HE HAS BUILT FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE HE IS THERE IN SUMMER AND IT IS FURNISHED MAGNIFICENTLY BUT HE WILL NOT SUFFER THE OLD HUMBLE ARLER COTTAGE HERE TO BE MEDDLED WITH

6758-72288-0027 BUT SEE SEE HERE HE COMES TO THE DEDICATION OF THE NEW CHURCH THEN THROUGH THE THRONG ADVANCED A BLONDE MIDDLE AGED MAN WITH BROAD FOREHEAD CLEAR BRIGHT BLUE EYES AND A FLOWING LIGHT BEARD
6758-72288-0028 ALL THE MEN PRESENT PLUCKED OFF THEIR HATS TO HIM AND MADE WAY FOR HIM AS HE ADVANCED BUT FULL OF SMILES HE HAD A HAND AND A WARM PRESSURE AND A KINDLY WORD AND A QUESTION AS TO FAMILY CONCERNS FOR EACH WHO WAS NEAR

6758-72288-0031 AND THEN FAINTLY AS FROM A FAR DISTANCE SOUNDED IN HER EAR THE CALL OF THE CUCKOO THREE THE MAGNIFICENT NEW CHURCH HAD SHRIVELLED UP TO THE ORIGINAL MEAN LITTLE EDIFICE ANNA HAD KNOWN ALL HER LIFE THE SQUARE WAS DESERTED
6758-72288-0032 THE COLD FAINT GLIMMER OF COMING DAWN WAS VISIBLE OVER THE EASTERN MOUNTAIN TOPS BUT STARS STILL SHONE IN THE SKY
6758-72288-0033 WITH A CRY OF PAIN LIKE A WOUNDED BEAST ANNA RAN HITHER AND THITHER SEEKING A REFUGE AND THEN FLED TO THE ONE HOME AND RESTING PLACE OF THE TROUBLED SOUL THE CHURCH SHE THRUST OPEN THE SWING DOOR PUSHED IN SPED OVER THE UNEVEN FLOOR AND FLUNG HERSELF ON HER KNEES BEFORE THE ALTAR BUT SEE BEFORE THAT ALTAR STOOD A PRIEST IN A VESTMENT OF BLACK AND SILVER

6758-72288-0038 LIFT UP YOUR HEARTS WHEN THE CELEBRANT STOOD FACING THE CONGREGATION WITH EXTENDED ARMS AND ALL RESPONDED WE LIFT THEM UP UNTO THE LORD
6758-72288-0039 HE RAISED HIS HANDS HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD WITH THE PALMS TOWARDS THE CONGREGATION AND IN A LOUD STERN VOICE EXCLAIMED CURSED IS THE UNFRUITFUL FIELD AMEN CURSED IS THE BARREN TREE

6758-72288-0044 BUT NO LAUGHTER FOR SHE WOULD NOT WOE WOE WOE HE LOWERED HIS HANDS AND THE TAPERS WERE EXTINGUISHED THE CELEBRANT FADED AS A VISION OF THE NIGHT
6758-72288-0045 THE SERVER VANISHED AS AN INCENSE CLOUD THE CONGREGATION DISAPPEARED MELTING INTO SHADOWS AND THEN FROM SHADOWS TO NOTHINGNESS
6758-72288-0046 AND ANNA WITH A SCREAM OF DESPAIR FLUNG HERSELF FORWARD WITH HER FACE ON THE PAVEMENT AND HER HANDS EXTENDED TWO YEARS AGO DURING THE FIRST WEEK IN JUNE AN ENGLISH TRAVELLER ARRIVED AT SIEBENSTEIN
6758-72288-0047 AND PUT UP AT THE KRONE WHERE AS HE WAS TIRED AND HUNGRY HE ORDERED AN EARLY SUPPER WHEN THAT WAS DISCUSSED HE STROLLED FORTH INTO THE VILLAGE SQUARE AND LEANED AGAINST THE WALL OF THE CHURCHYARD
6758-72288-0048 THE SUN HAD SET IN THE VALLEY BUT THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS WERE STILL IN THE GLORY OF ITS RAYS SURROUNDING THE PLACE AS A GOLDEN CROWN HE LIGHTED A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTO THE CEMETERY OBSERVED THERE AN OLD WOMAN
6758-72288-0049 BOWED OVER A GRAVE ABOVE WHICH STOOD A CROSS INSCRIBED JOSEPH ARLER AND SHE WAS TENDING THE FLOWERS ON IT AND LAYING OVER THE ARMS OF THE CROSS A LITTLE WREATH
6758-72288-0050 OF HEART'S EASE OR PANSY SHE HAD IN HER HAND A SMALL BASKET PRESENTLY SHE ROSE AND WALKED TOWARDS THE GATE BY WHICH STOOD THE TRAVELLER AS SHE PASSED HE SAID KINDLY TO HER GRUESS GOTT
6758-72288-0051 BUT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE AND WENT ON HER WAY HE WAS STRUCK WITH HER FACE HE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN ONE SO FULL OF BOUNDLESS SORROW ALMOST OF DESPAIR
6758-72288-0052 HIS EYES FOLLOWED HER AS SHE WALKED TOWARDS THE MILL STREAM AND THERE SHE TOOK HER PLACE ON THE WOODEN BRIDGE THAT CROSSED IT LEANING OVER THE HANDRAIL AND LOOKING DOWN INTO THE WATER
6758-72288-0053 OUT OF HER BASKET AND DROP IT INTO THE CURRENT WHICH CAUGHT AND CARRIED IT FORWARD THEN SHE TOOK A SECOND AND ALLOWED IT TO FALL INTO THE WATER THEN AFTER AN INTERVAL A THIRD A FOURTH AND HE COUNTED SEVEN IN ALL
6758-72288-0054 AFTER THAT SHE BOWED HER HEAD ON HER HANDS HER GREY HAIR FELL OVER THEM AND SHE BROKE INTO A PAROXYSM OF WEEPING
6758-72288-0055 THE TRAVELLER STANDING BY THE STREAM SAW THE SEVEN PANSIES SWEPT DOWN AND ONE BY ONE PASS OVER THE REVOLVING WHEEL AND VANISH HE TURNED HIMSELF ABOUT TO RETURN TO HIS INN
6758-72288-0056 WHO SEEMS SO BROKEN DOWN WITH SORROW THAT REPLIED THE MAN IS THE MOTHER OF PANSIES THE MOTHER OF PANSIES HE REPEATED WELL IT IS THE NAME SHE HAS ACQUIRED IN THE PLACE ACTUALLY SHE IS CALLED ANNA ARLER
