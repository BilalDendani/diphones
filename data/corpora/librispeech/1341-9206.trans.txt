1341-9206-0000 FORMERLY ENJOYED A MAGNIFICENT REPUTATION ALL WHO WERE AFFLICTED WITH GOUT OR GRAVEL IN GERMANY REPAIRED THITHER THE SAVAGE ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY DID NOT DETER THEM
1341-9206-0001 THEY BATHED IN THE CASCADE WHICH FELL IN LARGE SHEETS OF FOAM FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE ROCKS THEY DRANK ONE OR TWO DECANTERS OF MINERAL WATER DAILY
1341-9206-0002 AND THE DOCTOR OF THE PLACE DANIEL HASELNOSS WHO DISTRIBUTED HIS PRESCRIPTIONS CLAD IN A GREAT WIG AND CHESTNUT COAT
1341-9206-0003 THAT THE SPRING OF SPINBRONN ISSUES FROM A SORT OF CAVERN ABOUT FIVE FEET HIGH AND TWELVE OR FIFTEEN FEET WIDE THE WATER HAS A WARMTH OF SIXTY SEVEN DEGREES CENTIGRADE IT IS SALT AS FOR THE CAVERN ENTIRELY COVERED WITHOUT WITH MOSS
1341-9206-0004 IVY AND BRUSHWOOD ITS DEPTH IS UNKNOWN BECAUSE THE HOT EXHALATIONS PREVENT ALL ENTRANCE NEVERTHELESS STRANGELY ENOUGH IT WAS NOTICED EARLY IN THE LAST CENTURY THAT BIRDS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD THRUSHES DOVES HAWKS
1341-9206-0005 WERE ENGULFED IN IT IN FULL FLIGHT AND IT WAS NEVER KNOWN TO WHAT MYSTERIOUS INFLUENCE TO ATTRIBUTE THIS PARTICULAR IN EIGHTEEN O ONE AT THE HEIGHT OF THE SEASON OWING TO SOME CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH IS STILL UNEXPLAINED
1341-9206-0006 THE SPRING BECAME MORE ABUNDANT AND THE BATHERS WALKING BELOW ON THE GREENSWARD SAW A HUMAN SKELETON AS WHITE AS SNOW FALL FROM THE CASCADE YOU MAY JUDGE MASTER FRANTZ OF THE GENERAL FRIGHT
1341-9206-0007 IT WAS THOUGHT NATURALLY THAT A MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED AT SPINBRONN IN A RECENT YEAR AND THAT THE BODY OF THE VICTIM HAD BEEN THROWN IN THE SPRING
1341-9206-0008 TO HAVE BECOME REDUCED TO SUCH A STATE OF DESICCATION THIS VERY PLAUSIBLE REASONING DID NOT PREVENT A CROWD OF PATRONS WILD AT THE IDEA OF HAVING DRUNK THE SALINE WATER FROM LEAVING BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY
1341-9206-0009 THOSE WORST AFFLICTED WITH GOUT AND GRAVEL CONSOLED THEMSELVES BUT THE OVERFLOW CONTINUING ALL THE RUBBISH SLIME AND DETRITUS WHICH THE CAVERN CONTAINED WAS DISGORGED ON THE FOLLOWING DAYS
1341-9206-0010 A VERITABLE BONE YARD CAME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN SKELETONS OF ANIMALS OF EVERY KIND OF QUADRUPEDS BIRDS AND REPTILES IN SHORT ALL THAT ONE COULD CONCEIVE AS MOST HORRIBLE
1341-9206-0011 HASELNOSS ISSUED A PAMPHLET DEMONSTRATING THAT ALL THESE BONES WERE DERIVED FROM AN ANTEDILUVIAN WORLD THAT THEY WERE FOSSIL BONES
1341-9206-0012 ACCUMULATED THERE IN A SORT OF FUNNEL DURING THE UNIVERSAL FLOOD THAT IS TO SAY FOUR THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE CHRIST AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY ONE MIGHT CONSIDER THEM AS NOTHING BUT STONES AND THAT IT WAS NEEDLESS TO BE DISGUSTED
1341-9206-0013 BUT HIS WORK HAD SCARCELY REASSURED THE GOUTY WHEN ONE FINE MORNING THE CORPSE OF A FOX THEN THAT OF A HAWK WITH ALL ITS FEATHERS
1341-9206-0014 FELL FROM THE CASCADE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH THAT THESE REMAINS ANTEDATED THE FLOOD ANYWAY THE DISGUST WAS SO GREAT THAT EVERYBODY TIED UP HIS BUNDLE AND WENT TO TAKE THE WATERS ELSEWHERE
1341-9206-0015 HOW INFAMOUS CRIED THE BEAUTIFUL LADIES HOW HORRIBLE SO THAT'S WHAT THE VIRTUE OF THESE MINERAL WATERS CAME FROM OH TWERE BETTER TO DIE OF GRAVEL THAN CONTINUE SUCH A REMEDY
1341-9206-0016 AT THE END OF A WEEK THERE REMAINED AT SPINBRONN ONLY A BIG ENGLISHMAN WHO HAD GOUT IN HIS HANDS AS WELL AS IN HIS FEET WHO HAD HIMSELF ADDRESSED AS SIR THOMAS HAWERBURCH COMMODORE AND HE BROUGHT A LARGE RETINUE
1341-9206-0017 ACCORDING TO THE USAGE OF A BRITISH SUBJECT IN A FOREIGN LAND THIS PERSONAGE BIG AND FAT WITH A FLORID COMPLEXION BUT WITH HANDS SIMPLY KNOTTED WITH GOUT WOULD HAVE DRUNK SKELETON SOUP IF IT WOULD HAVE CURED HIS INFIRMITY
1341-9206-0018 HE LAUGHED HEARTILY OVER THE DESERTION OF THE OTHER SUFFERERS AND INSTALLED HIMSELF IN THE PRETTIEST CHALET AT HALF PRICE ANNOUNCING HIS DESIGN TO PASS THE WINTER AT SPINBRONN
1341-9206-0019 HERE LAWYER BREMER SLOWLY ABSORBED AN AMPLE PINCH OF SNUFF AS IF TO QUICKEN HIS REMINISCENCES HE SHOOK HIS LACED RUFF WITH HIS FINGER TIPS AND CONTINUED
1341-9206-0020 A YOUNG DOCTOR OF PIRMESENS NAMED CHRISTIAN WEBER HAD GONE OUT TO SAN DOMINGO IN THE HOPE OF MAKING HIS FORTUNE HE HAD ACTUALLY AMASSED SOME HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS M THE EXERCISE OF HIS PROFESSION WHEN THE NEGRO REVOLT BROKE OUT
1341-9206-0021 I NEED NOT RECALL TO YOU THE BARBAROUS TREATMENT TO WHICH OUR UNFORTUNATE FELLOW COUNTRYMEN WERE SUBJECTED AT HAITI
1341-9206-0022 AND TO SAVE PART OF HIS FORTUNE
1341-9206-0023 IN EIGHTEEN O ONE HE RETURNED TO PIRMESENS AND ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AT SPINBRONN WHERE DOCTOR HASELNOSS MADE OVER HIS HOUSE AND DEFUNCT PRACTICE
1341-9206-0024 A FRIGHTFUL CREATURE WITH A FLAT NOSE AND LIPS AS LARGE AS YOUR FIST AND HER HEAD TIED UP IN THREE BANDANAS OF RAZOR EDGED COLORS THIS POOR OLD WOMAN ADORED RED SHE HAD EARRINGS WHICH HUNG DOWN TO HER SHOULDERS
1341-9206-0025 AND THE MOUNTAINEERS OF HUNDSRUECK CAME FROM SIX LEAGUES AROUND TO STARE AT HER AS FOR DOCTOR WEBER HE WAS A TALL LEAN MAN INVARIABLY DRESSED IN A SKY BLUE COAT WITH CODFISH TAILS AND DEERSKIN BREECHES
1341-9206-0026 HE WORE A HAT OF FLEXIBLE STRAW AND BOOTS WITH BRIGHT YELLOW TOPS ON THE FRONT OF WHICH HUNG TWO SILVER TASSELS HE TALKED LITTLE HIS LAUGH WAS LIKE A NERVOUS ATTACK
1341-9206-0027 AND HIS GRAY EYES USUALLY CALM AND MEDITATIVE SHONE WITH SINGULAR BRILLIANCE AT THE LEAST SIGN OF CONTRADICTION EVERY MORNING HE FETCHED A TURN ROUND ABOUT THE MOUNTAIN LETTING HIS HORSE RAMBLE AT A VENTURE
1341-9206-0028 WHISTLING FOREVER THE SAME TUNE SOME NEGRO MELODY OR OTHER LASTLY THIS RUM CHAP HAD BROUGHT FROM HAITI A LOT OF BANDBOXES FILLED WITH QUEER INSECTS SOME BLACK AND REDDISH BROWN BIG AS EGGS
1341-9206-0029 OTHERS LITTLE AND SHIMMERING LIKE SPARKS HE SEEMED TO SET GREATER STORE BY THEM THAN BY HIS PATIENTS AND FROM TIME TO TIME ON COMING BACK FROM HIS RIDES HE BROUGHT A QUANTITY OF BUTTERFLIES PINNED TO HIS HAT BRIM
1341-9206-0030 SCARCELY WAS HE SETTLED IN HASELNOSS'S VAST HOUSE WHEN HE PEOPLED THE BACK YARD WITH OUTLANDISH BIRDS BARBARY GEESE WITH SCARLET CHEEKS GUINEA HENS AND A WHITE PEACOCK WHICH PERCHED HABITUALLY ON THE GARDEN WALL
1341-9206-0031 AND WHICH DIVIDED WITH THE NEGRESS THE ADMIRATION OF THE MOUNTAINEERS IF I ENTER INTO THESE DETAILS MASTER FRANTZ IT'S BECAUSE THEY RECALL MY EARLY YOUTH
1341-9206-0032 DOCTOR CHRISTIAN FOUND HIMSELF TO BE AT THE SAME TIME MY COUSIN AND MY TUTOR AND AS EARLY AS ON HIS RETURN TO GERMANY HE HAD COME TO TAKE ME AND INSTALL ME IN HIS HOUSE AT SPINBRONN
1341-9206-0033 THE BLACK AGATHA AT FIRST SIGHT INSPIRED ME WITH SOME FRIGHT AND I ONLY GOT SEASONED TO THAT FANTASTIC VISAGE WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY BUT SHE WAS SUCH A GOOD WOMAN
1341-9206-0034 SHE KNEW SO WELL HOW TO MAKE SPICED PATTIES SHE HUMMED SUCH STRANGE SONGS IN A GUTTURAL VOICE SNAPPING HER FINGERS AND KEEPING TIME WITH A HEAVY SHUFFLE THAT I ENDED BY TAKING HER IN FAST FRIENDSHIP
1341-9206-0035 AS REPRESENTING THE ONLY ONE OF HIS CLIENTELE THEN IN EVIDENCE AND I WAS NOT SLOW IN PERCEIVING THAT THESE TWO ECCENTRICS HELD LONG CONVENTICLES TOGETHER THEY CONVERSED ON MYSTERIOUS MATTERS ON THE TRANSMISSION OF FLUIDS
1341-9206-0036 AND INDULGED IN CERTAIN ODD SIGNS WHICH ONE OR THE OTHER HAD PICKED UP IN HIS VOYAGES SIR THOMAS IN THE ORIENT AND MY TUTOR IN AMERICA THIS PUZZLED ME GREATLY
1341-9206-0037 AS CHILDREN WILL I WAS ALWAYS LYING IN WAIT FOR WHAT THEY SEEMED TO WANT TO CONCEAL FROM ME BUT DESPAIRING IN THE END OF DISCOVERING ANYTHING I TOOK THE COURSE OF QUESTIONING AGATHA AND THE POOR OLD WOMAN
1341-9206-0038 AFTER MAKING ME PROMISE TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT IT ADMITTED THAT MY TUTOR WAS A SORCERER FOR THE REST
1341-9206-0039 AND THIS WOMAN HABITUALLY SO GAY AND FOREVER READY TO BE AMUSED BY NOTHING TREMBLED LIKE A LEAF WHEN HER MASTER'S GRAY EYES CHANCED TO ALIGHT ON HER ALL THIS MASTER FRANTZ
1341-9206-0040 SEEMS TO HAVE NO BEARING ON THE SPRINGS OF SPINBRONN BUT WAIT WAIT YOU SHALL SEE BY WHAT A SINGULAR CONCOURSE OF CIRCUMSTANCES MY STORY IS CONNECTED WITH IT I TOLD YOU THAT BIRDS DARTED INTO THE CAVERN
1341-9206-0041 AND EVEN OTHER AND LARGER CREATURES AFTER THE FINAL DEPARTURE OF THE PATRONS SOME OF THE OLD INHABITANTS OF THE VILLAGE RECALLED THAT A YOUNG GIRL NAMED LOUISE MUELLER WHO LIVED WITH HER INFIRM OLD GRANDMOTHER IN A COTTAGE ON THE PITCH OF THE SLOPE
1341-9206-0042 HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED HALF A HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE SHE HAD GONE OUT TO LOOK FOR HERBS IN THE FOREST AND THERE HAD NEVER BEEN ANY MORE NEWS OF HER AFTERWARDS EXCEPT THAT THREE OR FOUR DAYS LATER
1341-9206-0043 SOME WOODCUTTERS WHO WERE DESCENDING THE MOUNTAIN HAD FOUND HER SICKLE AND HER APRON A FEW STEPS FROM THE CAVERN FROM THAT MOMENT IT WAS EVIDENT TO EVERYONE THAT THE SKELETON WHICH HAD FALLEN FROM THE CASCADE
1341-9206-0044 ON THE SUBJECT OF WHICH HASELNOSS HAD TURNED SUCH FINE PHRASES WAS NO OTHER THAN THAT OF LOUISE MUELLER THE POOR GIRL HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN DRAWN INTO THE GULF BY THE MYSTERIOUS INFLUENCE WHICH ALMOST DAILY OVERCAME WEAKER BEINGS
1341-9206-0045 SUPERSTITIOUS LIKE ALL MOUNTAINEERS MAINTAINED THAT THE DEVIL LIVED IN THE CAVERN AND TERROR SPREAD IN THE WHOLE REGION NOW ONE AFTERNOON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH OF JULY EIGHTEEN O TWO
1341-9206-0046 MY COUSIN UNDERTOOK A NEW CLASSIFICATION OF THE INSECTS IN HIS BANDBOXES HE HAD SECURED SEVERAL RATHER CURIOUS ONES THE PRECEDING AFTERNOON I WAS WITH HIM HOLDING THE LIGHTED CANDLE WITH ONE HAND AND WITH THE OTHER A NEEDLE WHICH I HEATED RED HOT
1341-9206-0047 SIR THOMAS SEATED HIS CHAIR TIPPED BACK AGAINST THE SILL OF A WINDOW HIS FEET ON A STOOL WATCHED US WORK AND SMOKED HIS CIGAR WITH A DREAMY AIR I STOOD IN WITH SIR THOMAS HAWERBURCH
1341-9206-0048 AND I ACCOMPANIED HIM EVERY DAY TO THE WOODS IN HIS CARRIAGE HE ENJOYED HEARING ME CHATTER IN ENGLISH AND WISHED TO MAKE OF ME AS HE SAID A THOROUGH GENTLEMAN THE BUTTERFLIES LABELED
1341-9206-0049 YESTERDAY I SECURED A MAGNIFICENT HORN BEETLE THE GREAT LUCANUS CERVUS OF THE OAKS OF THE HARTZ IT HAS THIS PECULIARITY THE RIGHT CLAW DIVIDES IN FIVE BRANCHES
1341-9206-0050 IT'S A RARE SPECIMEN AT THE SAME TIME I OFFERED HIM THE NEEDLE AND AS HE PIERCED THE INSECT BEFORE FIXING IT ON THE CORK SIR THOMAS UNTIL THEN IMPASSIVE GOT UP AND
1341-9206-0051 DRAWING NEAR A BANDBOX HE BEGAN TO EXAMINE THE SPIDER CRAB OF GUIANA WITH A FEELING OF HORROR WHICH WAS STRIKINGLY PORTRAYED ON HIS FAT VERMILION FACE THAT IS CERTAINLY HE CRIED THE MOST FRIGHTFUL WORK OF THE CREATION
1341-9206-0052 THE MERE SIGHT OF IT IT MAKES ME SHUDDER IN TRUTH A SUDDEN PALLOR OVERSPREAD HIS FACE BAH SAID MY TUTOR
1341-9206-0053 ONE HEARS HIS NURSE CRY OUT ONE IS AFRAID AND THE IMPRESSION STICKS BUT IF YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE SPIDER WITH A STRONG MICROSCOPE YOU WOULD BE ASTONISHED AT THE FINISH OF HIS MEMBERS
1341-9206-0054 AT THEIR ADMIRABLE ARRANGEMENT AND EVEN AT THEIR ELEGANCE IT DISGUSTS ME INTERRUPTED THE COMMODORE BRUSQUELY POUAH IT HAD TURNED OVER IN HIS FINGERS OH I DON'T KNOW WHY HE DECLARED
1341-9206-0055 SPIDERS HAVE ALWAYS FROZEN MY BLOOD DOCTOR WEBER BEGAN TO LAUGH AND I WHO SHARED THE FEELINGS OF SIR THOMAS EXCLAIMED YES COUSIN
1341-9206-0056 IT IS DISGUSTING IT SPOILS ALL THE REST LITTLE CHUMP HE SAID HIS EYES SPARKLING WHAT MAKES YOU LOOK AT IT IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT GO TAKE YOURSELF OFF SOMEWHERE EVIDENTLY HE HAD TAKEN OFFENSE
1341-9206-0057 AND SIR THOMAS WHO WAS THEN BEFORE THE WINDOW CONTEMPLATING THE MOUNTAIN TURNED SUDDENLY TOOK ME BY THE HAND AND SAID TO ME IN A MANNER FULL OF GOOD WILL YOUR TUTOR FRANTZ SETS GREAT STORE BY HIS SPIDER WE LIKE THE TREES BETTER
1341-9206-0058 THE VERDURE COME LET'S GO FOR A WALK YES GO CRIED THE DOCTOR AND COME BACK FOR SUPPER AT SIX O'CLOCK THEN RAISING HIS VOICE NO HARD FEELINGS SIR HAWERBURCH
1341-9206-0059 THE COMMODORE REPLIED LAUGHINGLY AND WE GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS ALWAYS WAITING IN FRONT OF THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE SIR THOMAS WANTED TO DRIVE HIMSELF AND DISMISSED HIS SERVANT HE MADE ME SIT BESIDE HIM ON THE SAME SEAT AND WE STARTED OFF FOR ROTHALPS
1341-9206-0060 WHILE THE CARRIAGE WAS SLOWLY ASCENDING THE SANDY PATH AN INVINCIBLE SADNESS POSSESSED ITSELF OF MY SPIRIT SIR THOMAS ON HIS PART WAS GRAVE HE PERCEIVED MY SADNESS AND SAID
1341-9206-0061 YOU DON'T LIKE SPIDERS FRANTZ NOR DO I EITHER BUT THANK HEAVEN THERE AREN'T ANY DANGEROUS ONES IN THIS COUNTRY THE SPIDER CRAB WHICH YOUR TUTOR HAS IN HIS BOX COMES FROM FRENCH GUIANA
1341-9206-0062 IT INHABITS THE GREAT SWAMPY FORESTS FILLED WITH WARM VAPORS WITH SCALDING EXHALATIONS THIS TEMPERATURE IS NECESSARY TO ITS LIFE ITS WEB OR RATHER ITS VAST SNARE ENVELOPS AN ENTIRE THICKET
1341-9206-0063 IN IT IT TAKES BIRDS AS OUR SPIDERS TAKE FLIES BUT DRIVE THESE DISGUSTING IMAGES FROM YOUR MIND AND DRINK A SWALLOW OF MY OLD BURGUNDY THEN TURNING HE RAISED THE COVER OF THE REAR SEAT
1341-9206-0064 AND DREW FROM THE STRAW A SORT OF GOURD FROM WHICH HE POURED ME A FULL BUMPER IN A LEATHER GOBLET WHEN I HAD DRUNK ALL MY GOOD HUMOR RETURNED AND I BEGAN TO LAUGH AT MY FRIGHT
1341-9206-0065 THIN AND NERVOUS AS A GOAT WHICH CLAMBERED UP THE NEARLY PERPENDICULAR PATH THOUSANDS OF INSECTS HUMMED IN THE BUSHES AT OUR RIGHT AT A HUNDRED PACES OR MORE THE SOMBER OUTSKIRTS OF THE ROTHALP FORESTS EXTENDED BELOW US
1341-9206-0066 THE PROFOUND SHADES OF WHICH CHOKED WITH BRIERS AND FOUL BRUSH SHOWED HERE AND THERE AN OPENING FILLED WITH LIGHT ON OUR LEFT TUMBLED THE STREAM OF SPINBRONN
1341-9206-0067 AND THE MORE WE CLIMBED THE MORE DID ITS SILVERED SHEETS FLOATING IN THE ABYSS
1341-9206-0068 AND REDOUBLE THEIR SOUND OF CYMBALS I WAS CAPTIVATED BY THIS SPECTACLE SIR THOMAS LEANING BACK IN THE SEAT HIS KNEES AS HIGH AS HIS CHIN ABANDONED HIMSELF TO HIS HABITUAL REVERIES
1341-9206-0069 WHILE THE HORSE LABORING WITH HIS FEET AND HANGING HIS HEAD ON HIS CHEST AS A COUNTER WEIGHT TO THE CARRIAGE HELD ON AS IF SUSPENDED ON THE FLANK OF THE ROCK
1341-9206-0070 THE HAUNT OF THE ROEBUCK SURROUNDED BY TREMULOUS SHADOWS I ALWAYS LOST MY HEAD AND MY EYES TOO IN AN IMMENSE PERSPECTIVE AT THE APPARITION OF THE SHADOWS I
1341-9206-0071 TURNED MY HEAD AND SAW THE CAVERN OF SPINBRONN CLOSE AT HAND THE ENCOMPASSING MISTS WERE A MAGNIFICENT GREEN AND THE STREAM WHICH BEFORE FALLING EXTENDS OVER A BED OF BLACK SAND AND PEBBLES WAS SO CLEAR
1341-9206-0072 THAT ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT FROZEN IF PALE VAPORS DID NOT FOLLOW ITS SURFACE THE HORSE HAD JUST STOPPED OF HIS OWN ACCORD TO BREATHE SIR THOMAS RISING CAST HIS EYE OVER THE COUNTRYSIDE
1341-9206-0073 HOW CALM EVERYTHING IS SAID HE THEN AFTER AN INSTANT OF SILENCE IF YOU WEREN'T HERE FRANTZ I SHOULD CERTAINLY BATHE IN THE BASIN BUT COMMODORE SAID I WHY NOT BATHE
1341-9206-0074 I WOULD DO WELL TO STROLL AROUND IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE NEXT HILL IS A GREAT GLADE FILLED WITH WILD STRAWBERRIES I'LL GO AND PICK SOME I'LL BE BACK IN AN HOUR HA I SHOULD LIKE TO FRANTZ IT'S A GOOD IDEA
1341-9206-0075 IT'S NECESSARY TO OFFSET WINE WITH MINERAL WATER THIS LITTLE BED OF SAND PLEASES ME THEN HAVING SET BOTH FEET ON THE GROUND HE HITCHED THE HORSE TO THE TRUNK OF A LITTLE BIRCH AND WAVED HIS HAND AS IF TO SAY
1341-9206-0076 YOU MAY GO I SAW HIM SIT DOWN ON THE MOSS AND DRAW OFF HIS BOOTS AS I MOVED AWAY HE TURNED AND CALLED OUT IN AN HOUR FRANTZ THEY WERE HIS LAST WORDS
1341-9206-0077 AN HOUR LATER I RETURNED TO THE SPRING THE HORSE THE CARRIAGE AND THE CLOTHES OF SIR THOMAS ALONE MET MY EYES THE SUN WAS SETTING THE SHADOWS WERE GETTING LONG NOT A BIRD'S SONG UNDER THE FOLIAGE
1341-9206-0078 NOT THE HUM OF AN INSECT IN THE TALL GRASS A SILENCE LIKE DEATH LOOKED DOWN ON THIS SOLITUDE THE SILENCE FRIGHTENED ME I CLIMBED UP ON THE ROCK WHICH OVERLOOKS THE CAVERN
1341-9206-0079 I LOOKED TO THE RIGHT AND TO THE LEFT NOBODY I CALLED NO ANSWER THE SOUND OF MY VOICE REPEATED BY THE ECHOES FILLED ME WITH FEAR
1341-9206-0080 NIGHT SETTLED DOWN SLOWLY A VAGUE SENSE OF HORROR OPPRESSED ME SUDDENLY THE STORY OF THE YOUNG GIRL WHO HAD DISAPPEARED OCCURRED TO ME AND I BEGAN TO DESCEND ON THE RUN
1341-9206-0081 BUT ARRIVING BEFORE THE CAVERN I STOPPED SEIZED WITH UNACCOUNTABLE TERROR IN CASTING A GLANCE IN THE DEEP SHADOWS OF THE SPRING I HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF TWO MOTIONLESS RED POINTS
1341-9206-0082 THEN I SAW LONG LINES WAVERING IN A STRANGE MANNER IN THE MIDST OF THE DARKNESS AND THAT AT A DEPTH WHERE NO HUMAN EYE HAD EVER PENETRATED
1341-9206-0083 FEAR LENT MY SIGHT AND ALL MY SENSES AN UNHEARD OF SUBTLETY OF PERCEPTION FOR SEVERAL SECONDS I HEARD VERY DISTINCTLY THE EVENING PLAINT OF A CRICKET DOWN AT THE EDGE OF THE WOOD A DOG BARKING FAR AWAY
1341-9206-0084 VERY FAR IN THE VALLEY THEN MY HEART COMPRESSED FOR AN INSTANT BY EMOTION BEGAN TO BEAT FURIOUSLY AND I NO LONGER HEARD ANYTHING THEN UTTERING A HORRIBLE CRY I FLED ABANDONING THE HORSE THE CARRIAGE
1341-9206-0085 IN LESS THAN TWENTY MINUTES BOUNDING OVER THE ROCKS AND BRUSH I REACHED THE THRESHOLD OF OUR HOUSE AND CRIED IN A STIFLED VOICE RUN RUN SIR HAWERBURCH IS DEAD SIR HAWERBURCH IS IN THE CAVERN
1341-9206-0086 OF THE OLD WOMAN AGATHA AND OF TWO OR THREE PEOPLE INVITED IN THAT EVENING BY THE DOCTOR I FAINTED I HAVE LEARNED SINCE THAT DURING A WHOLE HOUR I RAVED DELIRIOUSLY THE WHOLE VILLAGE HAD GONE IN SEARCH OF THE COMMODORE
1341-9206-0087 AT TEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING ALL THE CROWD CAME BACK BRINGING THE CARRIAGE AND IN THE CARRIAGE THE CLOTHES OF SIR HAWERBURCH THEY HAD DISCOVERED NOTHING IT WAS
1341-9206-0088 IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE TEN STEPS IN THE CAVERN WITHOUT BEING SUFFOCATED DURING THEIR ABSENCE AGATHA AND I WAITED SITTING IN THE CHIMNEY CORNER I HOWLING INCOHERENT WORDS OF TERROR
1341-9206-0089 SHE WITH HANDS CROSSED ON HER KNEES EYES WIDE OPEN GOING FROM TIME TO TIME TO THE WINDOW TO SEE WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE FOR FROM THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN ONE COULD SEE TORCHES FLITTING IN THE WOODS ONE COULD HEAR HOARSE VOICES IN THE DISTANCE
1341-9206-0090 CALLING TO EACH OTHER IN THE NIGHT AT THE APPROACH OF HER MASTER AGATHA BEGAN TO TREMBLE THE DOCTOR ENTERED BRUSQUELY PALE HIS LIPS COMPRESSED DESPAIR WRITTEN ON HIS FACE
1341-9206-0091 A SCORE OF WOODCUTTERS FOLLOWED HIM TUMULTUOUSLY IN GREAT FELT HATS WITH WIDE BRIMS SWARTHY VISAGED SHAKING THE ASH FROM THEIR TORCHES SCARCELY WAS HE IN THE HALL WHEN MY TUTOR'S GLITTERING EYES SEEMED TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING
1341-9206-0092 HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE NEGRESS AND WITHOUT A WORD HAVING PASSED BETWEEN THEM THE POOR WOMAN BEGAN TO CRY NO NO I DON'T WANT TO AND I WISH IT
1341-9206-0093 REPLIED THE DOCTOR IN A HARD TONE ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THE NEGRESS HAD BEEN SEIZED BY AN INVINCIBLE POWER SHE SHUDDERED FROM HEAD TO FOOT
1341-9206-0094 SHE SAT DOWN WITH A CORPSE LIKE STIFFNESS ALL THE BYSTANDERS WITNESSES OF THIS SHOCKING SPECTACLE GOOD FOLK WITH PRIMITIVE AND CRUDE MANNERS BUT FULL OF PIOUS SENTIMENTS MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS
1341-9206-0095 AND I WHO KNEW NOT THEN EVEN BY NAME OF THE TERRIBLE MAGNETIC POWER OF THE WILL BEGAN TO TREMBLE BELIEVING THAT AGATHA WAS DEAD CHRISTIAN WEBER APPROACHED THE NEGRESS
1341-9206-0096 AND MAKING A RAPID PASS OVER HER FOREHEAD
1341-9206-0097 SAID HE YES MASTER SIR THOMAS HAWERBURCH AT THESE WORDS SHE SHUDDERED AGAIN
1341-9206-0098 YES YES SHE GASPED IN A STRANGLING VOICE I SEE HIM WHERE IS HE UP THERE IN THE BACK OF THE CAVERN DEAD
1341-9206-0099 DEAD SAID THE DOCTOR HOW THE SPIDER
1341-9206-0100 OH CONTROL YOUR AGITATION SAID THE DOCTOR WHO WAS QUITE PALE TELL US PLAINLY THE SPIDER CRAB HOLDS HIM BY THE THROAT HE IS THERE AT THE BACK UNDER THE ROCK WOUND ROUND BY WEBS
1341-9206-0101 CROWDING AROUND WITH THEIR EYES STICKING OUT OF THEIR HEADS WERE LISTENING INTENTLY
1341-9206-0102 HORRIBLE THEN HE RESUMED YOU SEE HIM I SEE HIM AND THE SPIDER IS IT BIG OH MASTER
1341-9206-0103 NOT EVEN ON THE BANKS OF THE MOCARIS NOR IN THE LOWLANDS OF KONANAMA IT IS AS LARGE AS MY HEAD THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE
1341-9206-0104 ALL THE ASSISTANTS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER THEIR FACES LIVID THEIR HAIR STANDING UP
1341-9206-0105 HAVING PASSED HIS HAND SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE NEGRESS'S FOREHEAD HE CONTINUED AGATHA TELL US HOW DEATH BEFELL SIR HAWERBURCH HE WAS BATHING IN THE BASIN OF THE SPRING
1341-9206-0106 WITH HIS BARE BACK IT WAS HUNGRY IT HAD FASTED FOR A LONG TIME IT SAW HIM WITH HIS ARMS ON THE WATER
1341-9206-0107 SIR HAWERBURCH SANK DOWN IN THE WATER AND DIED THEN THE SPIDER RETURNED AND SURROUNDED HIM WITH ITS WEB AND HE FLOATED
1341-9206-0108 IT DREW IN ON THE WEB NOW HE IS ALL BLACK THE DOCTOR TURNING TO ME WHO NO LONGER FELT THE SHOCK ASKED
1341-9206-0109 IS IT TRUE FRANTZ THAT THE COMMODORE WENT IN BATHING YES COUSIN CHRISTIAN AT WHAT TIME AT FOUR O'CLOCK AT FOUR O'CLOCK IT WAS VERY WARM WASN'T IT
1341-9206-0110 OH YES IT'S CERTAINLY SO SAID HE STRIKING HIS FOREHEAD THE MONSTER COULD COME OUT WITHOUT FEAR HE PRONOUNCED A FEW UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS AND THEN
1341-9206-0111 LOOKING TOWARD THE MOUNTAINEERS MY FRIENDS HE CRIED THAT IS WHERE THIS MASS OF DEBRIS CAME FROM OF SKELETONS WHICH SPREAD TERROR AMONG THE BATHERS THAT IS WHAT HAS RUINED YOU ALL
1341-9206-0112 IT IS THE SPIDER CRAB IT IS THERE HIDDEN IN ITS WEB AWAITING ITS PREY IN THE BACK OF THE CAVERN WHO CAN TELL THE NUMBER OF ITS VICTIMS AND FULL OF FURY HE LED THE WAY SHOUTING FAGOTS
1341-9206-0113 FAGOTS THE WOODCUTTERS FOLLOWED HIM VOCIFERATING TEN MINUTES LATER TWO LARGE WAGONS LADEN WITH FAGOTS WERE SLOWLY MOUNTING THE SLOPE A LONG FILE OF WOODCUTTERS THEIR BACKS BENT DOUBLE FOLLOWED
1341-9206-0114 ENVELOPED IN THE SOMBER NIGHT MY TUTOR AND I WALKED AHEAD LEADING THE HORSES BY THEIR BRIDLES AND THE MELANCHOLY MOON VAGUELY LIGHTED THIS FUNEREAL MARCH FROM TIME TO TIME THE WHEELS GRATED
1341-9206-0115 THEN THE CARTS RAISED BY THE IRREGULARITIES OF THE ROCKY ROAD FELL AGAIN IN THE TRACK WITH A HEAVY JOLT AS WE DREW NEAR THE CAVERN ON THE PLAYGROUND OF THE ROEBUCKS OUR CORTEGE HALTED
1341-9206-0116 THE TORCHES WERE LIT AND THE CROWD ADVANCED TOWARD THE GULF THE LIMPID WATER RUNNING OVER THE SAND REFLECTED THE BLUISH FLAME OF THE RESINOUS TORCHES THE RAYS OF WHICH REVEALED THE TOPS OF THE BLACK FIRS LEANING OVER THE ROCK
1341-9206-0117 THIS IS THE PLACE TO UNLOAD THE DOCTOR THEN SAID IT'S NECESSARY TO BLOCK UP THE MOUTH OF THE CAVERN AND IT WAS NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF TERROR THAT EACH UNDERTOOK THE DUTY OF EXECUTING HIS ORDERS
1341-9206-0118 THE FAGOTS FELL FROM THE TOP OF THE LOADS A FEW STAKES DRIVEN DOWN BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE SPRING PREVENTED THE WATER FROM CARRYING THEM AWAY TOWARD MIDNIGHT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVERN WAS COMPLETELY CLOSED
1341-9206-0119 THE WATER RUNNING OVER SPREAD TO BOTH SIDES ON THE MOSS THE TOP FAGOTS WERE PERFECTLY DRY THEN DOCTOR WEBER SUPPLYING HIMSELF WITH A TORCH HIMSELF LIT THE FIRE THE FLAMES RAN FROM TWIG TO TWIG WITH AN ANGRY CRACKLING
1341-9206-0120 AND SOON LEAPED TOWARD THE SKY CHASING CLOUDS OF SMOKE BEFORE THEM IT WAS A STRANGE AND SAVAGE SPECTACLE
1341-9206-0121 UNCEASINGLY RENEWED AND DISGORGED ALL AROUND STOOD THE WOODCUTTERS SOMBER MOTIONLESS EXPECTANT THEIR EYES FIXED ON THE OPENING AND I ALTHOUGH TREMBLING FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN FEAR COULD NOT TEAR AWAY MY GAZE
1341-9206-0122 WHEN A BLACK OBJECT WITH LONG HOOKED CLAWS APPEARED SUDDENLY IN THE SHADOW AND PRECIPITATED ITSELF TOWARD THE OPENING A CRY RESOUNDED ABOUT THE PYRE THE SPIDER DRIVEN BACK BY THE LIVE COALS REENTERED ITS CAVE
1341-9206-0123 THEN SMOTHERED DOUBTLESS BY THE SMOKE IT RETURNED TO THE CHARGE AND LEAPED OUT INTO THE MIDST OF THE FLAMES ITS LONG LEGS CURLED UP IT WAS AS LARGE AS MY HEAD AND OF A VIOLET RED
1341-9206-0124 ONE OF THE WOODCUTTERS FEARING LEST IT LEAP CLEAR OF THE FIRE THREW HIS HATCHET AT IT AND WITH SUCH GOOD AIM THAT ON THE INSTANT THE FIRE AROUND IT WAS COVERED WITH BLOOD
1341-9206-0125 BUT SOON THE FLAMES BURST OUT MORE VIGOROUSLY OVER IT AND CONSUMED THE HORRIBLE DESTROYER SUCH MASTER FRANTZ WAS THE STRANGE EVENT WHICH DESTROYED THE FINE REPUTATION
1341-9206-0126 WHICH THE WATERS OF SPINBRONN FORMERLY ENJOYED I CAN CERTIFY THE SCRUPULOUS PRECISION OF MY ACCOUNT BUT AS FOR GIVING YOU AN EXPLANATION THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO
1341-9206-0127 AT THE SAME TIME ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU THAT IT DOES NOT SEEM TO ME ABSURD TO ADMIT THAT A SPIDER UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A TEMPERATURE RAISED BY THERMAL WATERS
1341-9206-0128 WHICH AFFORDS THE SAME CONDITIONS OF LIFE AND DEVELOPMENT AS THE SCORCHING CLIMATES OF AFRICA AND SOUTH AMERICA SHOULD ATTAIN A FABULOUS SIZE
1341-9206-0129 WHICH EXPLAINS THE PRODIGIOUS EXUBERANCE OF THE ANTEDILUVIAN CREATION HOWEVER THAT MAY BE MY TUTOR
1341-9206-0130 SOLD THE HOUSE BACK TO HASELNOSS
1341-9206-0131 I WAS SENT TO BOARD IN STRASBOURG WHERE I REMAINED UNTIL EIGHTEEN O NINE THE GREAT POLITICAL EVENTS OF THE EPOCH THEN ABSORBING THE ATTENTION OF GERMANY AND FRANCE EXPLAIN WHY THE AFFAIR I HAVE JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT
