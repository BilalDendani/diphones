1084-151395-0038 THE QUESTION SEEMED IN SOME WAY TO GIVE HER A SHOCK AH I DON'T KNOW SHE MUTTERED SOME MIGHT NOT THINK SO I ALWAYS DID IT DEPENDED UPON THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT HER
1084-151395-0039 FOR THE FIRST TIME I FELT A THRILL OF ANTICIPATION SHOOT THROUGH MY VEINS WHY I COULD NOT SAY HER TONE WAS PECULIAR AND SHE SPOKE IN A SORT OF BROODING WAY AS THOUGH SHE WERE WEIGHING SOMETHING IN HER OWN MIND
1084-151395-0040 BUT THEN HER MANNER HAD BEEN PECULIAR THROUGHOUT WHATEVER IT WAS THAT AROUSED MY SUSPICION I DETERMINED HENCEFORTH TO KEEP A VERY SHARP EYE UPON HER LADYSHIP LEVELLING A STRAIGHT GLANCE AT HER FACE
1084-151395-0041 I ASKED HER HOW IT WAS THAT SHE CAME TO BE THE ONE TO INFORM THE AUTHORITIES OF THE GIRL'S DISAPPEARANCE DOESN'T MISTER BLAKE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT THE FAINTEST SHADOW OF A CHANGE CAME INTO HER MANNER YES SAID SHE I TOLD HIM AT BREAKFAST TIME
1084-151395-0042 BUT MISTER BLAKE DOESN'T TAKE MUCH INTEREST IN HIS SERVANTS HE LEAVES ALL SUCH MATTERS TO ME THEN HE DOES NOT KNOW YOU HAVE COME FOR THE POLICE NO SIR AND O IF YOU WOULD BE SO GOOD AS TO KEEP IT FROM HIM
1084-151395-0043 IT IS NOT NECESSARY HE SHOULD KNOW I SHALL LET YOU IN THE BACK WAY MISTER BLAKE IS A MAN WHO NEVER MEDDLES WITH ANYTHING AND WHAT DID MISTER BLAKE SAY THIS MORNING WHEN YOU TOLD HIM THAT THIS GIRL BY THE WAY WHAT IS HER NAME EMILY
1084-151395-0044 THAT THIS GIRL EMILY HAD DISAPPEARED DURING THE NIGHT NOT MUCH OF ANYTHING SIR HE WAS SITTING AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE READING HIS PAPER HE MERELY LOOKED UP FROWNED A LITTLE IN AN ABSENT MINDED WAY AND TOLD ME I MUST MANAGE THE SERVANTS AFFAIRS WITHOUT TROUBLING HIM
1084-151395-0045 AND YOU LET IT DROP YES SIR MISTER BLAKE IS NOT A MAN TO SPEAK TWICE TO I COULD EASILY BELIEVE THAT FROM WHAT I HAD SEEN OF HIM IN PUBLIC FOR THOUGH BY NO MEANS A HARSH LOOKING MAN HE HAD A RESERVED AIR WHICH
1084-151395-0046 IF MAINTAINED IN PRIVATE MUST HAVE MADE HIM VERY DIFFICULT OF APPROACH WE WERE NOW WITHIN A HALF BLOCK OR SO OF THE OLD FASHIONED MANSION REGARDED BY THIS SCION OF NEW YORK'S ARISTOCRACY
1084-151395-0047 AS ONE OF THE MOST DESIRABLE RESIDENCES IN THE CITY SO MOTIONING TO THE MAN WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED ME TO TAKE HIS STAND IN A DOORWAY NEAR BY AND WATCH FOR THE SIGNAL I WOULD GIVE HIM IN CASE I WANTED MISTER GRYCE I TURNED TO THE WOMAN
1084-151395-0048 AND ASKED HER HOW SHE PROPOSED TO GET ME INTO THE HOUSE WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF MISTER BLAKE O SIR
1084-151395-0049 HE WON'T NOTICE OR IF HE DOES WILL NOT ASK ANY QUESTIONS
