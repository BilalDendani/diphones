1446-122614-0000 WELL INFORMED OF THE APPROACH OF EVERY DANGER WHILE IT IS YET AT A DISTANCE THE INDIAN GENERALLY RESTS SECURE UNDER HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE SIGNS OF THE FOREST AND THE LONG AND DIFFICULT PATHS THAT SEPARATE HIM FROM THOSE HE HAS MOST REASON TO DREAD BUT THE ENEMY WHO
1446-122614-0001 BY ANY LUCKY CONCURRENCE OF ACCIDENTS HAS FOUND MEANS TO ELUDE THE VIGILANCE OF THE SCOUTS WILL SELDOM MEET WITH SENTINELS NEARER HOME TO SOUND THE ALARM IN ADDITION TO THIS GENERAL USAGE
1446-122614-0002 BUT SO SOON AS THEY WERE OBSERVED THE WHOLE OF THE JUVENILE PACK RAISED BY COMMON CONSENT A SHRILL AND WARNING WHOOP AND THEN SANK AS IT WERE BY MAGIC FROM BEFORE THE SIGHT OF THEIR VISITORS
1446-122614-0003 HE FOUND IT EVERYWHERE MET BY DARK QUICK AND ROLLING EYEBALLS GATHERING NO ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THIS STARTLING PRESAGE OF THE NATURE OF THE SCRUTINY HE WAS LIKELY TO UNDERGO FROM THE MORE MATURE JUDGMENTS OF THE MEN
1446-122614-0004 THERE WAS AN INSTANT WHEN THE YOUNG SOLDIER WOULD HAVE RETREATED IT WAS HOWEVER TOO LATE TO APPEAR TO HESITATE THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN HAD DRAWN A DOZEN WARRIORS TO THE DOOR OF THE NEAREST LODGE WHERE THEY STOOD CLUSTERED IN A DARK AND SAVAGE GROUP
1446-122614-0005 GRAVELY AWAITING THE NEARER APPROACH OF THOSE WHO HAD UNEXPECTEDLY COME AMONG THEM DAVID IN SOME MEASURE FAMILIARIZED TO THE SCENE LED THE WAY WITH A STEADINESS THAT NO SLIGHT OBSTACLE WAS LIKELY TO DISCONCERT INTO THIS VERY BUILDING
1446-122614-0006 IT WAS THE PRINCIPAL EDIFICE OF THE VILLAGE THOUGH ROUGHLY CONSTRUCTED OF THE BARK AND BRANCHES OF TREES BEING THE LODGE IN WHICH THE TRIBE HELD ITS COUNCILS AND PUBLIC MEETINGS DURING THEIR TEMPORARY RESIDENCE ON THE BORDERS OF THE ENGLISH PROVINCE
1446-122614-0007 HE TRUSTED TO THE DISCRETION OF HIS COMPANION WHOSE FOOTSTEPS HE CLOSELY FOLLOWED ENDEAVORING AS HE PROCEEDED TO RALLY HIS THOUGHTS FOR THE OCCASION HIS BLOOD CURDLED WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF IN ABSOLUTE CONTACT WITH SUCH FIERCE AND IMPLACABLE ENEMIES
1446-122614-0008 AND SEATED HIMSELF IN SILENCE SO SOON AS THEIR VISITOR HAD PASSED THE OBSERVANT WARRIORS FELL BACK FROM THE ENTRANCE AND ARRANGING THEMSELVES ABOUT HIM THEY SEEMED PATIENTLY TO AWAIT THE MOMENT WHEN IT MIGHT COMPORT WITH THE DIGNITY OF THE STRANGER TO SPEAK
1446-122614-0009 BY FAR THE GREATER NUMBER STOOD LEANING IN LAZY LOUNGING ATTITUDES AGAINST THE UPRIGHT POSTS THAT SUPPORTED THE CRAZY BUILDING WHILE THREE OR FOUR OF THE OLDEST AND MOST DISTINGUISHED OF THE CHIEFS PLACED THEMSELVES ON THE EARTH A LITTLE MORE IN ADVANCE
1446-122614-0010 A FLARING TORCH WAS BURNING IN THE PLACE AND SET ITS RED GLARE FROM FACE TO FACE AND FIGURE TO FIGURE AS IT WAVED IN THE CURRENTS OF AIR DUNCAN PROFITED BY ITS LIGHT TO READ THE PROBABLE CHARACTER OF HIS RECEPTION
1446-122614-0011 BUT HIS INGENUITY AVAILED HIM LITTLE AGAINST THE COLD ARTIFICES OF THE PEOPLE HE HAD ENCOUNTERED THE CHIEFS IN FRONT SCARCE CAST A GLANCE AT HIS PERSON KEEPING THEIR EYES ON THE GROUND WITH AN AIR THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN INTENDED FOR RESPECT
1446-122614-0012 BUT WHICH IT WAS QUITE EASY TO CONSTRUE INTO DISTRUST
1446-122614-0013 NOR EVEN THE FASHION OF A GARMENT UNHEEDED AND WITHOUT COMMENT AT LENGTH ONE WHOSE HAIR WAS BEGINNING TO BE SPRINKLED WITH GRAY BUT WHOSE SINEWY LIMBS AND FIRM TREAD ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS STILL EQUAL TO THE DUTIES OF MANHOOD
1446-122614-0014 THOUGH THEY SEEMED BY THE GESTURES THAT ACCOMPANIED THEM TO BE UTTERED MORE IN COURTESY THAN ANGER THE LATTER SHOOK HIS HEAD AND MADE A GESTURE INDICATIVE OF HIS INABILITY TO REPLY DO NONE OF MY BROTHERS SPEAK THE FRENCH OR THE ENGLISH
1446-122614-0015 HE SAID IN THE FORMER LANGUAGE LOOKING ABOUT HIM FROM COUNTENANCE TO COUNTENANCE IN HOPES OF FINDING A NOD OF ASSENT THOUGH MORE THAN ONE HAD TURNED AS IF TO CATCH THE MEANING OF HIS WORDS THEY REMAINED UNANSWERED I SHOULD BE GRIEVED TO THINK
1446-122614-0016 CONTINUED DUNCAN SPEAKING SLOWLY AND USING THE SIMPLEST FRENCH OF WHICH HE WAS THE MASTER TO BELIEVE THAT NONE OF THIS WISE AND BRAVE NATION UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE THAT THE GRAND MONARQUE USES WHEN HE TALKS TO HIS CHILDREN
1446-122614-0017 IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE CANADAS WHEN OUR GREAT FATHER SPEAKS TO HIS PEOPLE IS IT WITH THE TONGUE OF A HURON
1446-122614-0018 WHETHER THE COLOR OF THE SKIN BE RED OR BLACK OR WHITE RETURNED DUNCAN EVASIVELY THOUGH CHIEFLY IS HE SATISFIED WITH THE BRAVE HURONS IN WHAT MANNER WILL HE SPEAK
1446-122614-0019 DEMANDED THE WARY CHIEF WHEN THE RUNNERS COUNT TO HIM THE SCALPS WHICH FIVE NIGHTS AGO GREW ON THE HEADS OF THE YENGEESE THEY WERE HIS ENEMIES SAID DUNCAN SHUDDERING INVOLUNTARILY
1446-122614-0020 HE SEES THE DEAD YENGEESE BUT NO HURON WHAT CAN THIS MEAN A GREAT CHIEF LIKE HIM HAS MORE THOUGHTS THAN TONGUES
1446-122614-0021 HE LOOKS TO SEE THAT NO ENEMIES ARE ON HIS TRAIL THE CANOE OF A DEAD WARRIOR WILL NOT FLOAT ON THE HORICAN RETURNED THE SAVAGE GLOOMILY HIS EARS ARE OPEN TO THE DELAWARES
1446-122614-0022 WHO ARE NOT OUR FRIENDS AND THEY FILL THEM WITH LIES IT CANNOT BE SEE HE HAS BID ME WHO AM A MAN THAT KNOWS THE ART OF HEALING TO GO TO HIS CHILDREN
1446-122614-0023 THE RED HURONS OF THE GREAT LAKES AND ASK IF ANY ARE SICK ANOTHER SILENCE SUCCEEDED THIS ANNUNCIATION OF THE CHARACTER DUNCAN HAD ASSUMED EVERY EYE WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY BENT ON HIS PERSON
1446-122614-0024 AS IF TO INQUIRE INTO THE TRUTH OR FALSEHOOD OF THE DECLARATION WITH AN INTELLIGENCE AND KEENNESS THAT CAUSED THE SUBJECT OF THEIR SCRUTINY TO TREMBLE FOR THE RESULT HE WAS HOWEVER RELIEVED AGAIN BY THE FORMER SPEAKER
1446-122614-0025 DO THE CUNNING MEN OF THE CANADAS PAINT THEIR SKINS THE HURON COLDLY CONTINUED WE HAVE HEARD THEM BOAST THAT THEIR FACES WERE PALE
1446-122614-0026 WHEN AN INDIAN CHIEF COMES AMONG HIS WHITE FATHERS RETURNED DUNCAN WITH GREAT STEADINESS
1446-122614-0027 MY BROTHERS HAVE GIVEN ME PAINT AND I WEAR IT A LOW MURMUR OF APPLAUSE ANNOUNCED THAT THE COMPLIMENT OF THE TRIBE WAS FAVORABLY RECEIVED THE ELDERLY CHIEF MADE A GESTURE OF COMMENDATION
1446-122614-0028 AND AS HE HAD ALREADY PREPARED A SIMPLE AND PROBABLE TALE TO SUPPORT HIS PRETENDED OCCUPATION HIS HOPES OF ULTIMATE SUCCESS GREW BRIGHTER AFTER A SILENCE OF A FEW MOMENTS AS IF ADJUSTING HIS THOUGHTS IN ORDER TO MAKE A SUITABLE ANSWER TO THE DECLARATION THEIR GUESTS HAD JUST GIVEN
1446-122614-0029 ANOTHER WARRIOR AROSE AND PLACED HIMSELF IN AN ATTITUDE TO SPEAK WHILE HIS LIPS WERE YET IN THE ACT OF PARTING A LOW BUT FEARFUL SOUND AROSE FROM THE FOREST AND WAS IMMEDIATELY SUCCEEDED BY A HIGH SHRILL YELL THAT WAS DRAWN OUT
1446-122614-0030 UNTIL IT EQUALED THE LONGEST AND MOST PLAINTIVE HOWL OF THE WOLF THE SUDDEN AND TERRIBLE INTERRUPTION CAUSED DUNCAN TO START FROM HIS SEAT UNCONSCIOUS OF EVERYTHING BUT THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY SO FRIGHTFUL A CRY AT THE SAME MOMENT
1446-122614-0031 WHICH WERE STILL RINGING BENEATH THE ARCHES OF THE WOODS UNABLE TO COMMAND HIMSELF ANY LONGER THE YOUTH BROKE FROM THE PLACE AND PRESENTLY STOOD IN THE CENTER OF A DISORDERLY THRONG THAT INCLUDED NEARLY EVERYTHING HAVING LIFE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE ENCAMPMENT
1446-122614-0032 MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN THE AGED THE INFORM THE ACTIVE AND THE STRONG WERE ALIKE ABROAD SOME EXCLAIMING ALOUD OTHERS CLAPPING THEIR HANDS WITH A JOY THAT SEEMED FRANTIC AND ALL
1446-122614-0033 EXPRESSING THEIR SAVAGE PLEASURE IN SOME UNEXPECTED EVENT THOUGH ASTOUNDED AT FIRST BY THE UPROAR HEYWARD WAS SOON ENABLED TO FIND ITS SOLUTION BY THE SCENE THAT FOLLOWED THERE YET LINGERED SUFFICIENT LIGHT IN THE HEAVENS
1446-122614-0034 TO EXHIBIT THOSE BRIGHT OPENINGS AMONG THE TREE TOPS WHERE DIFFERENT PATHS LEFT THE CLEARING TO ENTER THE DEPTHS OF THE WILDERNESS BENEATH ONE OF THEM A LINE OF WARRIORS ISSUED FROM THE WOODS AND ADVANCED SLOWLY TOWARD THE DWELLINGS ONE IN FRONT BORE A SHORT POLE
1446-122614-0035 EVERY DISAGREEABLE SENSATION WAS QUIETED IN INWARD CONGRATULATION FOR THE OPPORTUNE RELIEF AND INSIGNIFICANCE IT CONFERRED ON HIMSELF WHEN AT THE DISTANCE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET FROM THE LODGES THE NEWLY ARRIVED WARRIORS HALTED
1446-122614-0036 THEIR PLAINTIVE AND TERRIFIC CRY WHICH WAS INTENDED TO REPRESENT EQUALLY THE WAILINGS OF THE DEAD AND THE TRIUMPH TO THE VICTORS HAD ENTIRELY CEASED
1446-122614-0037 IN WORDS THAT WERE FAR FROM APPALLING THOUGH NOT MORE INTELLIGIBLE TO THOSE FOR WHOSE EARS THEY WERE INTENDED THAN THEIR EXPRESSIVE YELLS IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CONVEY A SUITABLE IDEA OF THE SAVAGE ECSTASY WITH WHICH THE NEWS THUS IMPARTED WAS RECEIVED
1446-122614-0038 THE SQUAWS SEIZED CLUBS AXES OR WHATEVER WEAPON OF OFFENSE FIRST OFFERED ITSELF TO THEIR HANDS AND RUSHED EAGERLY TO ACT THEIR PART IN THE CRUEL GAME THAT WAS AT HAND EVEN THE CHILDREN WOULD NOT BE EXCLUDED
1446-122614-0039 BUT BOYS LITTLE ABLE TO WIELD THE INSTRUMENTS TORE THE TOMAHAWKS FROM THE BELTS OF THEIR FATHERS AND STOLE INTO THE RANKS APT IMITATORS OF THE SAVAGE TRAITS EXHIBITED BY THEIR PARENTS
1446-122614-0040 LARGE PILES OF BRUSH LAY SCATTERED ABOUT THE CLEARING AND A WARY AND AGED SQUAW WAS OCCUPIED IN FIRING AS MANY AS MIGHT SERVE TO LIGHT THE COMING EXHIBITION AS THE FLAME AROSE
1446-122614-0041 ITS POWER EXCEEDED THAT OF THE PARTING DAY AND ASSISTED TO RENDER OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME MORE DISTINCT AND MORE HIDEOUS THE WHOLE SCENE FORMED A STRIKING PICTURE WHOSE FRAME WAS COMPOSED OF THE DARK AND TALL BORDER OF PINES
1446-122614-0042 THE WARRIORS JUST ARRIVED WERE THE MOST DISTANT FIGURES A LITTLE IN ADVANCE STOOD TWO MEN WHO WERE APPARENTLY SELECTED FROM THE REST AS THE PRINCIPAL ACTORS IN WHAT WAS TO FOLLOW
1446-122614-0043 THOUGH IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT THEY WERE GOVERNED BY VERY DIFFERENT EMOTIONS WHILE ONE STOOD ERECT AND FIRM PREPARED TO MEET HIS FATE LIKE A HERO THE OTHER BOWED HIS HEAD AS IF PALSIED BY TERROR OR STRICKEN WITH SHAME
1446-122614-0044 THE HIGH SPIRITED DUNCAN FELT A POWERFUL IMPULSE OF ADMIRATION AND PITY TOWARD THE FORMER
1446-122614-0045 TO EXHIBIT HIS GENEROUS EMOTIONS HE WATCHED HIS SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT HOWEVER WITH EAGER EYES AND AS HE TRACED THE FINE OUTLINE OF HIS ADMIRABLY PROPORTIONED AND ACTIVE FRAME HE ENDEAVORED TO PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT IF THE POWERS OF MAN
1446-122614-0046 SECONDED BY SUCH NOBLE RESOLUTION COULD BEAR ONE HARMLESS THROUGH SO SEVERE A TRIAL THE YOUTHFUL CAPTIVE BEFORE HIM MIGHT HOPE FOR SUCCESS IN THE HAZARDOUS RACE HE WAS ABOUT TO RUN INSENSIBLY
1446-122614-0047 THAT FAR EXCEEDED ANY BEFORE HEARD THE MORE ABJECT OF THE TWO VICTIMS CONTINUED MOTIONLESS BUT THE OTHER BOUNDED FROM THE PLACE AT THE CRY WITH THE ACTIVITY AND SWIFTNESS OF A DEER INSTEAD OF RUSHING THROUGH THE HOSTILE LINES AS HAD BEEN EXPECTED
1446-122614-0048 AND LEAPING THE HEADS OF A ROW OF CHILDREN HE GAINED AT ONCE THE EXTERIOR AND SAFER SIDE OF THE FORMIDABLE ARRAY THE ARTIFICE WAS ANSWERED BY A HUNDRED VOICES RAISED IN IMPRECATIONS AND THE WHOLE OF THE EXCITED MULTITUDE BROKE FROM THEIR ORDER
1446-122614-0049 AND SPREAD THEMSELVES ABOUT THE PLACE IN WILD CONFUSION A DOZEN BLAZING PILES NOW SHED THEIR LURID BRIGHTNESS ON THE PLACE WHICH RESEMBLED SOME UNHALLOWED AND SUPERNATURAL ARENA
1446-122614-0050 IN WHICH MALICIOUS DEMONS HAD ASSEMBLED TO ACT THEIR BLOODY AND LAWLESS RITES THE FORMS IN THE BACKGROUND LOOKED LIKE UNEARTHLY BEINGS GLIDING BEFORE THE EYE AND CLEAVING THE AIR WITH FRANTIC AND UNMEANING GESTURES
1446-122614-0051 WHILE THE SAVAGE PASSIONS OF SUCH AS PASSED THE FLAMES WERE RENDERED FEARFULLY DISTINCT BY THE GLEAMS THAT SHOT ATHWART THEIR INFLAMED VISAGES IT WILL EASILY BE UNDERSTOOD THAT AMID SUCH A CONCOURSE OF VINDICTIVE ENEMIES NO BREATHING TIME WAS ALLOWED THE FUGITIVE
1446-122614-0052 BUT THE WHOLE BODY OF HIS CAPTORS THREW THEMSELVES BEFORE HIM AND DROVE HIM BACK INTO THE CENTER OF HIS RELENTLESS PERSECUTORS TURNING LIKE A HEADED DEER HE SHOT WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF AN ARROW THROUGH A PILLAR OF FORKED FLAME
1446-122614-0053 AND PASSING THE WHOLE MULTITUDE HARMLESS HE APPEARED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CLEARING HERE TOO HE WAS MET AND TURNED BY A FEW OF THE OLDER AND MORE SUBTLE OF THE HURONS ONCE MORE HE TRIED THE THRONG AS IF SEEKING SAFETY IN ITS BLINDNESS
1446-122614-0054 ARMS GLEAMING KNIVES AND FORMIDABLE CLUBS APPEARED ABOVE THEM BUT THE BLOWS WERE EVIDENTLY GIVEN AT RANDOM THE AWFUL EFFECT WAS HEIGHTENED BY THE PIERCING SHRIEKS OF THE WOMEN AND THE FIERCE YELLS OF THE WARRIORS
1446-122614-0055 NOW AND THEN DUNCAN CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A LIGHT FORM CLEAVING THE AIR IN SOME DESPERATE BOUND AND HE RATHER HOPED THAN BELIEVED THAT THE CAPTIVE YET RETAINED THE COMMAND OF HIS ASTONISHING POWERS OF ACTIVITY
1446-122614-0056 SUDDENLY THE MULTITUDE ROLLED BACKWARD AND APPROACHED THE SPOT WHERE HE HIMSELF STOOD THE HEAVY BODY IN THE REAR PRESSED UPON THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN FRONT AND BORE THEM TO THE EARTH THE STRANGER REAPPEARED IN THE CONFUSION
1446-122614-0057 HUMAN POWER COULD NOT HOWEVER MUCH LONGER ENDURE SO SEVERE A TRIAL OF THIS THE CAPTIVE SEEMED CONSCIOUS PROFITING BY THE MOMENTARY OPENING HE DARTED FROM AMONG THE WARRIORS AND MADE A DESPERATE
1446-122614-0058 AND WHAT SEEMED TO DUNCAN A FINAL EFFORT TO GAIN THE WOOD AS IF AWARE THAT NO DANGER WAS TO BE APPREHENDED FROM THE YOUNG SOLDIER THE FUGITIVE NEARLY BRUSHED HIS PERSON IN HIS FLIGHT A TALL AND POWERFUL HURON WHO HAD HUSBANDED HIS FORCES
1446-122614-0059 PRESSED CLOSE UPON HIS HEELS AND WITH AN UPLIFTED ARM MENACED A FATAL BLOW DUNCAN THRUST FORTH A FOOT AND THE SHOCK PRECIPITATED THE EAGER SAVAGE HEADLONG MANY FEET IN ADVANCE OF HIS INTENDED VICTIM
1446-122614-0060 THOUGHT ITSELF IS NOT QUICKER THAN WAS THE MOTION WITH WHICH THE LATTER PROFITED BY THE ADVANTAGE HE TURNED GLEAMED LIKE A METEOR AGAIN BEFORE THE EYES OF DUNCAN AND AT THE NEXT MOMENT WHEN THE LATTER RECOVERED HIS RECOLLECTION AND GAZED AROUND IN QUEST OF THE CAPTIVE
1446-122614-0061 HE SAW HIM QUIETLY LEANING AGAINST A SMALL PAINTED POST WHICH STOOD BEFORE THE DOOR OF THE PRINCIPAL LODGE APPREHENSIVE THAT THE PART HE HAD TAKEN IN THE ESCAPE MIGHT PROVE FATAL TO HIMSELF DUNCAN LEFT THE PLACE WITHOUT DELAY HE FOLLOWED THE CROWD
1446-122614-0062 AND BREATHING THICK AND HARD AFTER HIS EXERTIONS BUT DISDAINING TO PERMIT A SINGLE SIGN OF SUFFERING TO ESCAPE HIS PERSON WAS NOW PROTECTED BY IMMEMORIAL AND SACRED USAGE UNTIL THE TRIBE IN COUNCIL HAD DELIBERATED AND DETERMINED ON HIS FATE
1446-122614-0063 THAT THE DISAPPOINTED WOMEN DID NOT LAVISHLY EXPEND ON THE SUCCESSFUL STRANGER THEY FLOUTED AT HIS EFFORTS AND TOLD HIM WITH BITTER SCOFFS THAT HIS FEET WERE BETTER THAN HIS HANDS AND THAT HE MERITED WINGS
1446-122614-0064 TO ALL THIS THE CAPTIVE MADE NO REPLY BUT WAS CONTENT TO PRESERVE AN ATTITUDE IN WHICH DIGNITY WAS SINGULARLY BLENDED WITH DISDAIN EXASPERATED AS MUCH BY HIS COMPOSURE AS BY HIS GOOD FORTUNE THEIR WORDS BECAME UNINTELLIGIBLE
1446-122614-0065 AND WERE SUCCEEDED BY SHRILL PIERCING YELLS
1446-122614-0066 WHO HAD TAKEN THE NECESSARY PRECAUTION TO FIRE THE PILES MADE HER WAY THROUGH THE THRONG AND CLEARED A PLACE FOR HERSELF IN FRONT OF THE CAPTIVE THE SQUALID AND WITHERED PERSON OF THIS HAG MIGHT WELL HAVE OBTAINED FOR HER THE CHARACTER OF POSSESSING MORE THAN HUMAN CUNNING
1446-122614-0067 AS MORE INTELLIGIBLE TO THE SUBJECT OF HER GIBES SHE COMMENCED ALOUD LOOK YOU DELAWARE SHE SAID SNAPPING HER FINGERS IN HIS FACE YOUR NATION IS A RACE OF WOMEN
1446-122614-0068 YOUR SQUAWS ARE THE MOTHERS OF DEER BUT IF A BEAR OR A WILDCAT OR A SERPENT WERE BORN AMONG YOU YE WOULD FLEE THE HURON GIRLS SHALL MAKE YOU PETTICOATS AND WE WILL FIND YOU A HUSBAND
1446-122614-0069 A BURST OF SAVAGE LAUGHTER SUCCEEDED THIS ATTACK DURING WHICH THE SOFT AND MUSICAL MERRIMENT OF THE YOUNGER FEMALES STRANGELY CHIMED WITH THE CRACKED VOICE OF THEIR OLDER AND MORE MALIGNANT COMPANION BUT THE STRANGER WAS SUPERIOR TO ALL THEIR EFFORTS
1446-122614-0070 HIS HEAD WAS IMMOVABLE NOR DID HE BETRAY THE SLIGHTEST CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ANY WERE PRESENT EXCEPT WHEN HIS HAUGHTY EYE ROLLED TOWARD THE DUSKY FORMS OF THE WARRIORS WHO STALKED IN THE BACKGROUND SILENT AND SULLEN OBSERVERS OF THE SCENE
1446-122614-0071 INFURIATED AT THE SELF COMMAND OF THE CAPTIVE THE WOMAN PLACED HER ARMS AKIMBO AND THROWING HERSELF INTO A POSTURE OF DEFIANCE SHE BROKE OUT ANEW IN A TORRENT OF WORDS THAT NO ART OF OURS COULD COMMIT SUCCESSFULLY TO PAPER HER BREATH WAS HOWEVER
1446-122614-0072 EXPENDED IN VAIN FOR ALTHOUGH DISTINGUISHED IN HER NATION AS A PROFICIENT IN THE ART OF ABUSE SHE WAS PERMITTED TO WORK HERSELF INTO SUCH A FURY AS ACTUALLY TO FOAM AT THE MOUTH WITHOUT CAUSING A MUSCLE TO VIBRATE IN THE MOTIONLESS FIGURE OF THE STRANGER
1446-122614-0073 THE EFFECT OF HIS INDIFFERENCE BEGAN TO EXTEND ITSELF TO THE OTHER SPECTATORS AND A YOUNGSTER WHO WAS JUST QUITTING THE CONDITION OF A BOY TO ENTER THE STATE OF MANHOOD ATTEMPTED TO ASSIST THE TERMAGANT
1446-122614-0074 BY FLOURISHING HIS TOMAHAWK BEFORE THEIR VICTIM AND ADDING HIS EMPTY BOASTS TO THE TAUNTS OF THE WOMEN THEN INDEED THE CAPTIVE TURNED HIS FACE TOWARD THE LIGHT AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE STRIPLING WITH AN EXPRESSION THAT WAS SUPERIOR TO CONTEMPT
1446-122614-0075 AT THE NEXT MOMENT HE RESUMED HIS QUIET AND RECLINING ATTITUDE AGAINST THE POST BUT THE CHANGE OF POSTURE HAD PERMITTED DUNCAN TO EXCHANGE GLANCES WITH THE FIRM AND PIERCING EYES OF UNCAS
1446-122614-0076 BREATHLESS WITH AMAZEMENT AND HEAVILY OPPRESSED WITH THE CRITICAL SITUATION OF HIS FRIEND HEYWARD RECOILED BEFORE THE LOOK TREMBLING LEST ITS MEANING MIGHT IN SOME UNKNOWN MANNER HASTEN THE PRISONER'S FATE
1446-122614-0077 THERE WAS NOT HOWEVER ANY INSTANT CAUSE FOR SUCH AN APPREHENSION JUST THEN A WARRIOR FORCED HIS WAY INTO THE EXASPERATED CROWD MOTIONING THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN ASIDE WITH A STERN GESTURE HE TOOK UNCAS BY THE ARM
1446-122614-0078 AND LED HIM TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE COUNCIL LODGE THITHER ALL THE CHIEFS AND MOST OF THE DISTINGUISHED WARRIORS FOLLOWED AMONG WHOM THE ANXIOUS HEYWARD FOUND MEANS TO ENTER WITHOUT ATTRACTING ANY DANGEROUS ATTENTION TO HIMSELF
1446-122614-0079 A FEW MINUTES WERE CONSUMED IN DISPOSING OF THOSE PRESENT IN A MANNER SUITABLE TO THEIR RANK AND INFLUENCE IN THE TRIBE AN ORDER VERY SIMILAR TO THAT ADOPTED IN THE PRECEDING INTERVIEW WAS OBSERVED THE AGED AND SUPERIOR CHIEFS OCCUPYING THE AREA OF THE SPACIOUS APARTMENT
1446-122614-0080 WITHIN THE POWERFUL LIGHT OF A GLARING TORCH WHILE THEIR JUNIORS AND INFERIORS WERE ARRANGED IN THE BACKGROUND PRESENTING A DARK OUTLINE OF SWARTHY AND MARKED VISAGES IN THE VERY CENTER OF THE LODGE
1446-122614-0081 IMMEDIATELY UNDER AN OPENING THAT ADMITTED THE TWINKLING LIGHT OF ONE OR TWO STARS STOOD UNCAS CALM ELEVATED AND COLLECTED HIS HIGH AND HAUGHTY CARRIAGE WAS NOT LOST ON HIS CAPTORS WHO OFTEN BENT THEIR LOOKS ON HIS PERSON WITH EYES WHICH
1446-122614-0082 PLAINLY BETRAYED THEIR ADMIRATION OF THE STRANGER'S DARING THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT WITH THE INDIVIDUAL WHOM DUNCAN HAD OBSERVED TO STAND FORTH WITH HIS FRIEND PREVIOUSLY TO THE DESPERATE TRIAL OF SPEED AND WHO INSTEAD OF JOINING IN THE CHASE HAD REMAINED
1446-122614-0083 AS THOUGH IMPELLED BY A FATE TO WHOSE DECREES HE SUBMITTED SEEMINGLY WITHOUT A STRUGGLE HEYWARD PROFITED BY THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO GAZE IN HIS FACE SECRETLY APPREHENSIVE HE MIGHT FIND THE FEATURES OF ANOTHER ACQUAINTANCE
1446-122614-0084 BUT THEY PROVED TO BE THOSE OF A STRANGER AND WHAT WAS STILL MORE INEXPLICABLE OF ONE WHO BORE ALL THE DISTINCTIVE MARKS OF A HURON WARRIOR INSTEAD OF MINGLING WITH HIS TRIBE HOWEVER HE SAT APART A SOLITARY BEING IN A MULTITUDE
1446-122614-0085 HIS FORM SHRINKING INTO A CROUCHING AND ABJECT ATTITUDE AS IF ANXIOUS TO FILL AS LITTLE SPACE AS POSSIBLE WHEN EACH INDIVIDUAL HAD TAKEN HIS PROPER STATION AND SILENCE REIGNED IN THE PLACE THE GRAY HAIRED CHIEF ALREADY INTRODUCED TO THE READER
1446-122614-0086 DELAWARE HE SAID THOUGH ONE OF A NATION OF WOMEN YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF A MAN I WOULD GIVE YOU FOOD BUT HE WHO EATS WITH A HURON SHOULD BECOME HIS FRIEND
1446-122614-0087 REST IN PEACE TILL THE MORNING SUN WHEN OUR LAST WORDS SHALL BE SPOKEN SEVEN NIGHTS AND AS MANY SUMMER DAYS HAVE I FASTED ON THE TRAIL OF THE HURONS UNCAS COLDLY REPLIED
1446-122614-0088 RESUMED THE OTHER WITHOUT APPEARING TO REGARD THE BOAST OF HIS CAPTIVE WHEN THEY GET BACK THEN WILL OUR WISE MAN SAY TO YOU LIVE OR DIE HAS A HURON NO EARS SCORNFULLY EXCLAIMED UNCAS
1446-122614-0089 WHO UNDERSTOOD THE MOHICAN TO ALLUDE TO THE FATAL RIFLE OF THE SCOUT BENT FORWARD IN EARNEST OBSERVATION OF THE EFFECT IT MIGHT PRODUCE ON THE CONQUERORS BUT THE CHIEF WAS CONTENT WITH SIMPLY RETORTING
1446-122614-0090 HE POINTED WITH HIS FINGER TOWARD THE SOLITARY HURON BUT WITHOUT DEIGNING TO BESTOW ANY OTHER NOTICE ON SO UNWORTHY AN OBJECT THE WORDS OF THE ANSWER AND THE AIR OF THE SPEAKER PRODUCED A STRONG SENSATION AMONG HIS AUDITORS
1446-122614-0091 EVERY EYE ROLLED SULLENLY TOWARD THE INDIVIDUAL INDICATED BY THE SIMPLE GESTURE AND A LOW THREATENING MURMUR PASSED THROUGH THE CROWD THE OMINOUS SOUNDS REACHED THE OUTER DOOR AND THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN PRESSING INTO THE THRONG
1446-122614-0092 NO GAP HAD BEEN LEFT BETWEEN SHOULDER AND SHOULDER THAT WAS NOT NOW FILLED WITH THE DARK LINEAMENTS OF SOME EAGER AND CURIOUS HUMAN COUNTENANCE IN THE MEANTIME THE MORE AGED CHIEFS IN THE CENTER COMMUNED WITH EACH OTHER IN SHORT AND BROKEN SENTENCES
1446-122614-0093 NOT A WORD WAS UTTERED THAT DID NOT CONVEY THE MEANING OF THE SPEAKER IN THE SIMPLEST AND MOST ENERGETIC FORM AGAIN A LONG AND DEEPLY SOLEMN PAUSE TOOK PLACE IT WAS KNOWN BY ALL PRESENT TO BE THE BRAVE PRECURSOR OF A WEIGHTY AND IMPORTANT JUDGMENT
1446-122614-0094 THEY WHO COMPOSED THE OUTER CIRCLE OF FACES WERE ON TIPTOE TO GAZE AND EVEN THE CULPRIT FOR AN INSTANT FORGOT HIS SHAME IN A DEEPER EMOTION AND EXPOSED HIS ABJECT FEATURES IN ORDER TO CAST AN ANXIOUS AND TROUBLED GLANCE AT THE DARK ASSEMBLAGE OF CHIEFS
1446-122614-0095 THE SILENCE WAS FINALLY BROKEN BY THE AGED WARRIOR SO OFTEN NAMED HE AROSE FROM THE EARTH AND MOVING PAST THE IMMOVABLE FORM OF UNCAS PLACED HIMSELF IN A DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE BEFORE THE OFFENDER AT THAT MOMENT
1446-122614-0096 HOLDING THE TORCH AND MUTTERING THE INDISTINCT WORDS OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SPECIES OF INCANTATION THOUGH HER PRESENCE WAS ALTOGETHER AN INTRUSION IT WAS UNHEEDED
1446-122614-0097 APPROACHING UNCAS SHE HELD THE BLAZING BRAND IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO CAST ITS RED GLARE ON HIS PERSON AND TO EXPOSE THE SLIGHTEST EMOTION OF HIS COUNTENANCE THE MOHICAN MAINTAINED HIS FIRM AND HAUGHTY ATTITUDE AND HIS EYES SO FAR FROM DEIGNING TO MEET HER INQUISITIVE LOOK
1446-122614-0098 DWELT STEADILY ON THE DISTANCE AS THOUGH IT PENETRATED THE OBSTACLES WHICH IMPEDED THE VIEW AND LOOKED INTO FUTURITY SATISFIED WITH HER EXAMINATION SHE LEFT HIM WITH A SLIGHT EXPRESSION OF PLEASURE AND PROCEEDED TO PRACTISE THE SAME TRYING EXPERIMENT
1446-122614-0099 THE LIGHT RENDERED EVERY LIMB AND JOINT DISCERNIBLE AND DUNCAN TURNED AWAY IN HORROR WHEN HE SAW THEY WERE WRITHING IN IRREPRESSIBLE AGONY THE WOMAN WAS COMMENCING A LOW AND PLAINTIVE HOWL AT THE SAD AND SHAMEFUL SPECTACLE WHEN THE CHIEF PUT FORTH HIS HAND
1446-122614-0100 AND GENTLY PUSHED HER ASIDE REED THAT BENDS HE SAID ADDRESSING THE YOUNG CULPRIT BY NAME AND IN HIS PROPER LANGUAGE THOUGH THE GREAT SPIRIT HAS MADE YOU PLEASANT TO THE EYES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAT YOU HAD NOT BEEN BORN
1446-122614-0101 YOUR TONGUE IS LOUD IN THE VILLAGE BUT IN BATTLE IT IS STILL NONE OF MY YOUNG MEN STRIKE THE TOMAHAWK DEEPER INTO THE WAR POST NONE OF THEM SO LIGHTLY ON THE YENGEESE THE ENEMY KNOW THE SHAPE OF YOUR BACK
1446-122614-0102 BUT THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN THE COLOR OF YOUR EYES THREE TIMES HAVE THEY CALLED ON YOU TO COME AND AS OFTEN DID YOU FORGET TO ANSWER YOUR NAME WILL NEVER BE MENTIONED AGAIN IN YOUR TRIBE IT IS ALREADY FORGOTTEN
1446-122614-0103 AS THE CHIEF SLOWLY UTTERED THESE WORDS PAUSING IMPRESSIVELY BETWEEN EACH SENTENCE THE CULPRIT RAISED HIS FACE IN DEFERENCE TO THE OTHER'S RANK AND YEARS SHAME HORROR AND PRIDE STRUGGLED IN ITS LINEAMENTS HIS EYE WHICH WAS CONTRACTED WITH INWARD ANGUISH
1446-122614-0104 GLEAMED ON THE PERSONS OF THOSE WHOSE BREATH WAS HIS FAME AND THE LATTER EMOTION FOR AN INSTANT PREDOMINATED HE AROSE TO HIS FEET AND BARING HIS BOSOM LOOKED STEADILY ON THE KEEN GLITTERING KNIFE THAT WAS ALREADY UPHELD BY HIS INEXORABLE JUDGE
1446-122614-0105 AS THE WEAPON PASSED SLOWLY INTO HIS HEART HE EVEN SMILED AS IF IN JOY AT HAVING FOUND DEATH LESS DREADFUL THAN HE HAD ANTICIPATED AND FELL HEAVILY ON HIS FACE AT THE FEET OF THE RIGID AND UNYIELDING FORM OF UNCAS
1446-122614-0106 DASHED THE TORCH TO THE EARTH AND BURIED EVERYTHING IN DARKNESS THE WHOLE SHUDDERING GROUP OF SPECTATORS GLIDED FROM THE LODGE LIKE TROUBLED SPRITES AND DUNCAN THOUGHT THAT HE AND THE YET THROBBING BODY OF THE VICTIM OF AN INDIAN JUDGMENT
