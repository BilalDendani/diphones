6402-105213-0000 THE CALMNESS OF NATURE CONTRASTED WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY PASSIONS THAT HAD BEEN UNCHAINED ON ACCOUNT OF THE HEAT
6402-105213-0001 AND FROM A DISTANCE THE PALACE COULD BE SEEN ILLUMINATED AS IF FOR A FETE IT HAD JUST STRUCK MIDNIGHT THE REVOLUTION WAS EXECUTING THE PROGRAMME OF THE CORDELIERS SECTION THE TOCSIN WAS SOUNDING ALL OVER THE CITY EVERYBODY NAMED THE CHURCH WHOSE BELL HE THOUGHT HE RECOGNIZED
6402-105213-0002 THE DRUMS MINGLED WITH THE TOCSIN THE REVOLUTIONISTS BEAT THE GENERAL ALARM AND THE ROYALISTS THE CALL TO ARMS NO ONE WAS ASLEEP AT THE TUILERIES
6402-105213-0003 THERE WAS NO FURTHER QUESTION OF ETIQUETTE THE NIGHT RECEPTION IN THE ROYAL BEDCHAMBER WAS OMITTED FOR THE FIRST TIME CERTAIN OLD SERVITORS FAITHFUL GUARDIANS OF TRADITION IN VAIN RECALLED
6402-105213-0004 AND SHUTTING HIMSELF UP WITH THIS VENERABLE PRIEST

6402-105213-0006 I CONSENTED TO DO SO ON THE FOURTEENTH OF JULY SAID HE BECAUSE ON THAT DAY I WAS MERELY GOING TO A CEREMONY WHERE AN ASSASSIN'S DAGGER MIGHT BE APPREHENDED BUT ON A DAY WHEN MY PARTY MAY BE FORCED TO FIGHT WITH THE REVOLUTIONISTS
6402-105213-0007 I SHOULD THINK IT COWARDLY TO PRESERVE MY LIFE BY SUCH MEANS MARIE ANTOINETTE WAS GRAVE AND TRANQUIL IN HER HEROISM THERE WAS NOTHING AFFECTED ABOUT HER NOTHING THEATRICAL NEITHER PASSION DESPAIR NOR THE SPIRIT OF REVENGE
6402-105213-0008 ACCORDING TO THE EXPRESSIONS OF ROEDERER WHO NEVER LEFT HER SHE WAS A WOMAN A MOTHER A WIFE IN PERIL SHE FEARED SHE HOPED SHE GRIEVED
6402-105213-0009 SOMETHING LIKE TWO HUNDRED NOBLEMEN WHO HAD SPONTANEOUSLY REPAIRED TO THE KING SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY SWISS
6402-105213-0010 WERE THE LAST RESOURCES OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE FRENCH ARMY

6402-105213-0013 THEY SEEMED AS IF THEY HAD COME TO A FETE INSTEAD OF A COMBAT THE SERVANTS OF THE CHATEAU JOINED THEM SOME OF THEM HAD PISTOLS AND BLUNDERBUSSES
6402-105213-0014 HAD TAKEN THE TONGS FROM THE CHIMNEYS THEY JESTED WITH EACH OTHER OVER THEIR ACCOUTREMENTS NO NO THERE WAS NOTHING LAUGHABLE IN THESE CHAMPIONS OF MISFORTUNE THEY REPRESENTED THE PAST WITH ITS ANCIENT FIDELITY TO THE ALTAR AND THE THRONE
6402-105213-0015 A GREAT POET WHO HAD THE SPIRIT OF DIVINATION HEINRICH HEINE
6402-105213-0016 THE MIDDLE CLASSES WILL POSSIBLY MAKE LESS RESISTANCE THAN THE ARISTOCRACY WOULD DO IN A SIMILAR CASE EVEN IN ITS MOST PITIABLE WEAKNESS ITS ENERVATION BY IMMORALITY AND ITS DEGENERATION THROUGH FLATTERY
6402-105213-0017 THE OLD NOBILITY WAS STILL ALIVE TO A CERTAIN POINT OF HONOR UNKNOWN TO OUR MIDDLE CLASSES WHO HAVE BECOME PROSPEROUS BY INDUSTRY
6402-105213-0018 THEY SHOOK HANDS WITH EACH OTHER AMID CRIES OF LONG LIVE THE KING LONG LIVE THE NATIONAL GUARD BUT THE TROOPS OUTSIDE DID NOT SHARE THESE SENTIMENTS JEALOUS OF THE ROYALISTS ASSEMBLED IN THE PALACE THEY WANTED TO HAVE THEM SENT OUT

6402-105213-0020 HE ARRIVED THERE AT ELEVEN IN THE EVENING
6402-105213-0021 IT SEEMS THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF COMMOTION YES SIRE HE REPLIED THE EXCITEMENT IS GREAT
6402-105213-0022 AND HIS PRETENDED HASTE TO WAIT UPON THE KING
6402-105213-0023 WAS IN COMMAND OF ALL MILITARY FORCES WHY EXCLAIMED HE HAVE THE POLICE REFUSED CARTRIDGES TO THE NATIONAL GUARD
6402-105213-0024 MY MEN HAVE ONLY FOUR CHARGES APIECE SOME OF THEM HAVE NOT ONE NO MATTER I ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING MY MEASURES ARE TAKEN PROVIDING I AM AUTHORIZED BY AN ORDER SIGNED BY YOU TO REPEL FORCE BY FORCE
6402-105213-0025 NOT DARING TO AVOW HIS COMPLICITY WITH THE RIOT PETION SIGNED THE ORDER DEMANDED THEN HE MADE HIS ESCAPE UNDER PRETEXT OF INSPECTING THE GARDENS AND FELL AMONGST SOME ROYALIST NATIONAL GUARDS WHO REPRIMANDED HIM SEVERELY
6402-105213-0026 TO GUARANTEE THE PALACE AGAINST THE ATTEMPTS OF THE POPULACE AND WENT TO THE ASSEMBLY IT HAD ADJOURNED AT TEN O'CLOCK THE EVENING BEFORE

6402-105213-0030 WHICH WAS TO BE SO FATAL TO HIM WHEN HE CAME BEFORE THE MUNICIPALITY
6402-105213-0031 PIKES AND SABRES FINISHED HIM HIS BODY WAS THROWN INTO THE SEINE SUCH WAS THE FIRST EXPLOIT OF THE NEW COMMUNE IT PRELUDED THUS THE MASSACRES OF SEPTEMBER
6402-105213-0032 SAYS COUNT DE VAUBLANC IN HIS MEMOIRS WAS BEYOND ANY DOUBT THE CHIEF CAUSE OF THE CALAMITIES OF THE DAY IF HE HAD ATTACKED THE REBELS AS SOON AS THEY CAME NEAR THE PALACE HE COULD HAVE DISPERSED THEM WITH EASE
6402-105213-0033 NO TROOP MARCHING FROM A GIVEN POINT IN THIS IMMENSE CITY KNEW WHETHER IT WAS SECONDED BY THE REBELS FROM OTHER QUARTERS AND LOST MUCH TIME IN MAKING SURE THE SECOND EXPLOIT OF THE COMMUNE WAS TO CONFINE PETION AT THE MAYORALTY UNDER THE GUARD OF SIX MEN
6402-105213-0034 LOOKING WITH MELANCHOLY AT THE HORIZON WHICH BEGAN TO LIGHTEN SISTER SAID SHE TO MADAME ELISABETH
