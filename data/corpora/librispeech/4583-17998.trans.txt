4583-17998-0000 UNFORTUNATELY THIS HAPPY STATE OF AFFAIRS DID NOT CONTINUE FOR LONG AND OUR WORK WAS SOON INTERRUPTED IN A RUDE AND STARTLING MANNER TWO MOST VORACIOUS AND INSATIABLE MAN EATING LIONS APPEARED UPON THE SCENE AND FOR OVER NINE MONTHS WAGED AN INTERMITTENT WARFARE AGAINST THE RAILWAY
4583-17998-0001 AND ALL THOSE CONNECTED WITH IT IN THE VICINITY OF TSAVO THIS CULMINATED IN A PERFECT REIGN OF TERROR IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT WHEN THEY ACTUALLY SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING THE RAILWAY WORKS TO A COMPLETE STANDSTILL FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS
4583-17998-0002 BRAVED ANY DANGER IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THEIR FAVOURITE FOOD THEIR METHODS THEN BECAME SO UNCANNY AND THEIR MAN STALKING SO WELL TIMED AND SO CERTAIN OF SUCCESS THAT THE WORKMEN FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT THEY WERE NOT REAL ANIMALS AT ALL BUT DEVILS IN LIONS SHAPE
4583-17998-0003 MANY A TIME THE COOLIES SOLEMNLY ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY USELESS TO ATTEMPT TO SHOOT THEM THEY WERE QUITE CONVINCED THAT THE ANGRY SPIRITS OF TWO DEPARTED NATIVE CHIEFS HAD TAKEN THIS FORM IN ORDER TO PROTEST AGAINST A RAILWAY BEING MADE THROUGH THEIR COUNTRY
4583-17998-0004 AND BY STOPPING ITS PROGRESS TO AVENGE THE INSULT THUS SHOWN TO THEM I HAD ONLY BEEN A FEW DAYS AT TSAVO WHEN I FIRST HEARD THAT THESE BRUTES HAD BEEN SEEN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD SHORTLY AFTERWARDS ONE OR TWO COOLIES MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED AND I WAS TOLD
4583-17998-0005 THAT THEY HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF BY NIGHT FROM THEIR TENTS AND DEVOURED BY LIONS AT THE TIME I DID NOT CREDIT THIS STORY AND WAS MORE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE UNFORTUNATE MEN HAD BEEN THE VICTIMS OF FOUL PLAY AT THE HANDS OF SOME OF THEIR COMRADES
4583-17998-0006 THEY WERE AS IT HAPPENED VERY GOOD WORKMEN AND HAD EACH SAVED A FAIR NUMBER OF RUPEES SO I THOUGHT IT QUITE LIKELY THAT SOME SCOUNDRELS FROM THE GANGS HAD MURDERED THEM FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR MONEY THIS SUSPICION HOWEVER WAS VERY SOON DISPELLED ABOUT THREE WEEKS AFTER MY ARRIVAL
4583-17998-0007 I WAS ROUSED ONE MORNING ABOUT DAYBREAK AND TOLD THAT ONE OF MY JEMADARS A FINE POWERFUL SIKH NAMED UNGAN SINGH HAD BEEN SEIZED IN HIS TENT DURING THE NIGHT AND DRAGGED OFF AND EATEN
4583-17998-0008 NATURALLY I LOST NO TIME IN MAKING AN EXAMINATION OF THE PLACE AND WAS SOON CONVINCED THAT THE MAN HAD INDEED BEEN CARRIED OFF BY A LION AS ITS PUG MARKS WERE PLAINLY VISIBLE IN THE SAND WHILE THE FURROWS MADE BY THE HEELS OF THE VICTIM SHOWED THE DIRECTION IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN DRAGGED AWAY
4583-17998-0009 MOREOVER THE JEMADAR SHARED HIS TENT WITH HALF A DOZEN OTHER WORKMEN AND ONE OF HIS BEDFELLOWS HAD ACTUALLY WITNESSED THE OCCURRENCE HE GRAPHICALLY DESCRIBED HOW AT ABOUT MIDNIGHT THE LION SUDDENLY PUT ITS HEAD IN AT THE OPEN TENT DOOR AND SEIZED UNGAN SINGH WHO
4583-17998-0010 HAPPENED TO BE NEAREST THE OPENING BY THE THROAT THE UNFORTUNATE FELLOW CRIED OUT CHORO LET GO AND THREW HIS ARMS UP ROUND THE LION'S NECK THE NEXT MOMENT HE WAS GONE AND HIS PANIC STRICKEN COMPANIONS LAY HELPLESS
4583-17998-0011 FORCED TO LISTEN TO THE TERRIBLE STRUGGLE WHICH TOOK PLACE OUTSIDE POOR UNGAN SINGH MUST HAVE DIED HARD BUT WHAT CHANCE HAD HE AS A COOLIE GRAVELY REMARKED WAS HE NOT FIGHTING WITH A LION
4583-17998-0012 ON HEARING THIS DREADFUL STORY I AT ONCE SET OUT TO TRY TO TRACK THE ANIMAL AND WAS ACCOMPANIED BY CAPTAIN HASLEM WHO HAPPENED TO BE STAYING AT TSAVO AT THE TIME AND WHO POOR FELLOW HIMSELF MET WITH A TRAGIC FATE VERY SHORTLY AFTERWARDS
4583-17998-0013 WE FOUND IT AN EASY MATTER TO FOLLOW THE ROUTE TAKEN BY THE LION AS HE APPEARED TO HAVE STOPPED SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE BEGINNING HIS MEAL POOLS OF BLOOD MARKED THESE HALTING PLACES WHERE HE DOUBTLESS INDULGED IN THE MAN EATERS HABIT OF LICKING THE SKIN OFF
4583-17998-0014 SO AS TO GET AT THE FRESH BLOOD I HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THEIR CUSTOM FROM THE APPEARANCE OF TWO HALF EATEN BODIES WHICH I SUBSEQUENTLY RESCUED THE SKIN WAS GONE IN PLACES AND THE FLESH LOOKED DRY
4583-17998-0015 AS IF IT HAD BEEN SUCKED ON REACHING THE SPOT WHERE THE BODY HAD BEEN DEVOURED A DREADFUL SPECTACLE PRESENTED ITSELF THE GROUND ALL ROUND WAS COVERED WITH BLOOD AND MORSELS OF FLESH AND BONES
4583-17998-0016 BUT THE UNFORTUNATE JEMADAR'S HEAD HAD BEEN LEFT INTACT SAVE FOR THE HOLES MADE BY THE LION'S TUSKS ON SEIZING HIM AND LAY A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE OTHER REMAINS THE EYES STARING WIDE OPEN WITH A STARTLED HORRIFIED LOOK IN THEM
4583-17998-0017 THE PLACE WAS CONSIDERABLY CUT UP AND ON CLOSER EXAMINATION WE FOUND THAT TWO LIONS HAD BEEN THERE AND HAD PROBABLY STRUGGLED FOR POSSESSION OF THE BODY IT WAS THE MOST GRUESOME SIGHT I HAD EVER SEEN
4583-17998-0018 WE COLLECTED THE REMAINS AS WELL AS WE COULD AND HEAPED STONES ON THEM
4583-17998-0019 FOR IT WE DID NOT BURY BUT TOOK BACK TO CAMP FOR IDENTIFICATION BEFORE THE MEDICAL OFFICER THUS OCCURRED MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF MAN EATING LIONS AND I VOWED THERE AND THEN THAT I WOULD SPARE NO PAINS TO RID THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE BRUTES
4583-17998-0020 I LITTLE KNEW THE TROUBLE THAT WAS IN STORE FOR ME OR HOW NARROW WERE TO BE MY OWN ESCAPES FROM SHARING POOR UNGAN SINGH'S FATE THAT SAME NIGHT I SAT UP IN A TREE CLOSE TO THE LATE JEMADAR'S TENT
4583-17998-0021 HOPING THAT THE LIONS WOULD RETURN TO IT FOR ANOTHER VICTIM I WAS FOLLOWED TO MY PERCH BY A FEW OF THE MORE TERRIFIED COOLIES WHO BEGGED TO BE ALLOWED TO SIT UP IN THE TREE WITH ME ALL THE OTHER WORKMEN REMAINED IN THEIR TENTS BUT NO MORE DOORS WERE LEFT OPEN
4583-17998-0022 AND A TWELVE BORE SHOT GUN ONE BARREL LOADED WITH BALL AND THE OTHER WITH SLUG SHORTLY AFTER SETTLING DOWN TO MY VIGIL MY HOPES OF BAGGING ONE OF THE BRUTES WERE RAISED BY THE SOUND OF THEIR OMINOUS ROARING COMING CLOSER AND CLOSER
4583-17998-0023 PRESENTLY THIS CEASED AND QUIET REIGNED FOR AN HOUR OR TWO AS LIONS ALWAYS STALK THEIR PREY IN COMPLETE SILENCE ALL AT ONCE HOWEVER WE HEARD A GREAT UPROAR AND FRENZIED CRIES COMING FROM ANOTHER CAMP ABOUT HALF A MILE AWAY
4583-17998-0024 WE KNEW THEN THAT THE LIONS HAD SEIZED A VICTIM THERE AND THAT WE SHOULD SEE OR HEAR NOTHING FURTHER OF THEM THAT NIGHT NEXT MORNING I FOUND THAT ONE OF THE BRUTES HAD BROKEN INTO A TENT AT RAILHEAD CAMP WHENCE WE HAD HEARD THE COMMOTION DURING THE NIGHT
4583-17998-0025 AND HAD MADE OFF WITH A POOR WRETCH WHO WAS LYING THERE ASLEEP AFTER A NIGHT'S REST THEREFORE I TOOK UP MY POSITION IN A SUITABLE TREE NEAR THIS TENT
4583-17998-0026 I FELT FAIRLY SAFE AS ONE OF MY MEN CARRIED A BRIGHT LAMP CLOSE BEHIND ME HE IN HIS TURN WAS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER LEADING A GOAT WHICH I TIED UNDER MY TREE IN THE HOPE THAT THE LION MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO SEIZE IT INSTEAD OF A COOLIE
4583-17998-0027 AND I WAS SOON THOROUGHLY CHILLED AND WET I STUCK TO MY UNCOMFORTABLE POST HOWEVER HOPING TO GET A SHOT BUT I WELL REMEMBER THE FEELING OF IMPOTENT DISAPPOINTMENT I EXPERIENCED WHEN ABOUT MIDNIGHT I HEARD SCREAMS AND CRIES AND A HEART RENDING SHRIEK
4583-17998-0028 WHICH TOLD ME THAT THE MAN EATERS HAD AGAIN ELUDED ME AND HAD CLAIMED ANOTHER VICTIM ELSEWHERE AT THIS TIME THE VARIOUS CAMPS FOR THE WORKMEN WERE VERY SCATTERED SO THAT THE LIONS HAD A RANGE OF SOME EIGHT MILES ON EITHER SIDE OF TSAVO TO WORK UPON
4583-17998-0029 AND AS THEIR TACTICS SEEMED TO BE TO BREAK INTO A DIFFERENT CAMP EACH NIGHT IT WAS MOST DIFFICULT TO FORESTALL THEM THEY ALMOST APPEARED TOO TO HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY AND UNCANNY FACULTY OF FINDING OUT OUR PLANS BEFOREHAND
4583-17998-0030 SO THAT NO MATTER IN HOW LIKELY OR HOW TEMPTING A SPOT WE LAY IN WAIT FOR THEM THEY INVARIABLY AVOIDED THAT PARTICULAR PLACE AND SEIZED THEIR VICTIM FOR THE NIGHT FROM SOME OTHER CAMP
4583-17998-0031 HUNTING THEM BY DAY MOREOVER IN SUCH A DENSE WILDERNESS AS SURROUNDED US WAS AN EXCEEDINGLY TIRING AND REALLY FOOLHARDY UNDERTAKING IN A THICK JUNGLE OF THE KIND ROUND TSAVO THE HUNTED ANIMAL HAS EVERY CHANCE AGAINST THE HUNTER
4583-17998-0032 AS HOWEVER CAREFUL THE LATTER MAY BE A DEAD TWIG OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT IS SURE TO CRACKLE JUST AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT AND SO GIVE THE ALARM STILL I NEVER GAVE UP HOPE OF SOME DAY FINDING THEIR LAIR AND ACCORDINGLY CONTINUED TO DEVOTE
4583-17998-0033 ALL MY SPARE TIME TO CRAWLING ABOUT THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH MANY A TIME WHEN ATTEMPTING TO FORCE MY WAY THROUGH THIS BEWILDERING TANGLE I HAD TO BE RELEASED BY MY GUN BEARER FROM THE FAST CLUTCHES OF THE WAIT A BIT
4583-17998-0034 AFTER THEY HAD SEIZED A VICTIM ONLY TO LOSE THE TRAIL FROM THERE ONWARDS OWING TO THE ROCKY NATURE OF THE GROUND WHICH THEY SEEMED TO BE CAREFUL TO CHOOSE IN RETREATING TO THEIR DEN
4583-17998-0035 AT THIS EARLY STAGE OF THE STRUGGLE I AM GLAD TO SAY THE LIONS WERE NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR EFFORTS TO CAPTURE A HUMAN BEING FOR THEIR NIGHTLY MEAL AND ONE OR TWO AMUSING INCIDENTS OCCURRED TO RELIEVE THE TENSION FROM WHICH OUR NERVES WERE BEGINNING TO SUFFER
4583-17998-0036 ON ONE OCCASION AN ENTERPRISING BUNNIAH INDIAN TRADER WAS RIDING ALONG ON HIS DONKEY LATE ONE NIGHT WHEN SUDDENLY A LION SPRANG OUT ON HIM KNOCKING OVER BOTH MAN AND BEAST THE DONKEY WAS BADLY WOUNDED AND THE LION WAS JUST ABOUT TO SEIZE THE TRADER
4583-17998-0037 WHEN IN SOME WAY OR OTHER HIS CLAWS BECAME ENTANGLED IN A ROPE BY WHICH TWO EMPTY OIL TINS WERE STRUNG ACROSS THE DONKEY'S NECK THE RATTLE AND CLATTER MADE BY THESE AS HE DRAGGED THEM AFTER HIM GAVE HIM SUCH A FRIGHT
4583-17998-0038 WHO QUICKLY MADE HIS WAY UP THE NEAREST TREE AND REMAINED THERE SHIVERING WITH FEAR FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT SHORTLY AFTER THIS EPISODE A GREEK CONTRACTOR NAMED THEMISTOCLES PAPPADIMITRINI HAD AN EQUALLY MARVELLOUS ESCAPE
4583-17998-0039 HE WAS SLEEPING PEACEFULLY IN HIS TENT ONE NIGHT WHEN A LION BROKE IN AND SEIZED AND MADE OFF WITH THE MATTRESS ON WHICH HE WAS LYING THOUGH RUDELY AWAKENED THE GREEK WAS QUITE UNHURT AND SUFFERED FROM NOTHING WORSE THAN A BAD FRIGHT THIS SAME MAN HOWEVER
4583-17998-0040 MET WITH A MELANCHOLY FATE NOT LONG AFTERWARDS HE HAD BEEN TO THE KILIMA N'JARO DISTRICT TO BUY CATTLE AND ON THE RETURN JOURNEY ATTEMPTED TO TAKE A SHORT CUT ACROSS COUNTRY TO THE RAILWAY BUT PERISHED MISERABLY OF THIRST ON THE WAY
4583-17998-0041 ON ANOTHER OCCASION FOURTEEN COOLIES WHO SLEPT TOGETHER IN A LARGE TENT WERE ONE NIGHT AWAKENED BY A LION SUDDENLY JUMPING ON TO THE TENT AND BREAKING THROUGH IT THE BRUTE LANDED WITH ONE CLAW ON A COOLIE'S SHOULDER WHICH WAS BADLY TORN
4583-17998-0042 BUT INSTEAD OF SEIZING THE MAN HIMSELF IN HIS HURRY HE GRABBED A LARGE BAG OF RICE WHICH HAPPENED TO BE LYING IN THE TENT AND MADE OFF WITH IT DROPPING IT IN DISGUST SOME LITTLE DISTANCE AWAY WHEN HE REALISED HIS MISTAKE
4583-17998-0043 THESE HOWEVER WERE ONLY THE EARLIER EFFORTS OF THE MAN EATERS LATER ON AS WILL BE SEEN NOTHING FLURRIED OR FRIGHTENED THEM IN THE LEAST AND EXCEPT AS FOOD THEY SHOWED A COMPLETE CONTEMPT FOR HUMAN BEINGS HAVING ONCE MARKED DOWN A VICTIM
