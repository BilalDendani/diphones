6097-293619-0037 THE GLORIOUS SWAN SONG OF A DYING HEART A LAME TRAMP COMES ALONG THE RAILWAY TRACK A GRIZZLED DOG WHOSE DAY IS NEARLY DONE HE PASSES PAUSES THEN COMES SLOWLY BACK
6097-293619-0038 AND LISTENS THERE AN AUDIENCE OF ONE SHE SINGS HER GOLDEN VOICE IS PASSION FRAUGHT AS WHEN SHE CHARMED A THOUSAND EAGER EARS HE LISTENS TREMBLING AND SHE KNOWS IT NOT
6097-293619-0039 AND DOWN HIS HOLLOW CHEEKS ROLL BITTER TEARS SHE CEASES AND IS STILL AS IF TO PRAY THERE IS NO SOUND THE STARS ARE ALL ALIGHT ONLY A WRETCH WHO STUMBLES ON HIS WAY
6097-293619-0040 ONLY A VAGRANT SOBBING IN THE NIGHT THE RHYME OF THE REMITTANCE MAN THERE'S A FOUR PRONGED BUCK A SWINGING IN THE SHADOW OF MY CABIN AND IT ROAMED THE VELVET VALLEY TILL TO DAY
6097-293619-0041 NOW I'VE HAD MY LAZY SUPPER AND THE LEVEL SUN IS GLEAMING ON THE WATER WHERE THE SILVER SALMON PLAY AND I LIGHT MY LITTLE CORN COB AND I LINGER SOFTLY DREAMING IN THE TWILIGHT OF A LAND THAT'S FAR AWAY
6097-293619-0042 FAR AWAY SO FAINT AND FAR IS FLAMING LONDON FEVERED PARIS THAT I FANCY I HAVE GAINED ANOTHER STAR FAR AWAY THE DIN AND HURRY FAR AWAY THE SIN AND WORRY FAR AWAY

6097-293619-0044 CRUSHED MY FANCIES STARVED MY SOUL AND GONE TO BUSINESS EVERY DAY WELL THE CHERRY BENDS WITH BLOSSOM AND THE VIVID GRASS IS SPRINGING AND THE STAR LIKE LILY NESTLES IN THE GREEN
6097-293619-0045 AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN WHILE ABOVE THE SCENTED PINE GLOOM PILING HEIGHTS OF GOLDEN GLORY THE SUN GOD PAINTS HIS CANVAS IN THE WEST I CAN COUCH ME DEEP IN CLOVER
6097-293619-0046 I CAN LISTEN TO THE STORY OF THE LAZY LAPPING WATER IT IS BEST
6097-293619-0047 AND THE FROZEN SNOW BETRAYS THE PANTHER'S TRACK AND THE ROBIN GREETS THE DAYSPRING WITH THE RAPTURE OF A LOVER I AM HAPPY AND I'LL NEVERMORE GO BACK FOR I KNOW I'D JUST BE LONGING FOR THE LITTLE OLD LOG CABIN
6097-293619-0048 WITH THE MORNING GLORY CLINGING TO THE DOOR TILL I LOATHED THE CITY PLACES CURSED THE CARE ON ALL THE FACES
6097-293619-0049 SO SEND ME FAR FROM LOMBARD STREET AND WRITE ME DOWN A FAILURE PUT A LITTLE IN MY PURSE AND LEAVE ME FREE SAY
6097-293619-0050 IS ONE OF US NO LONGER LET HIM BE
6097-293619-0051 BY THE TRAILS MY FEET HAVE BROKEN THE DIZZY PEAKS I'VE SCALED THE CAMP FIRE'S GLOW BY THE LONELY SEAS I'VE SAILED IN
6097-293619-0052 YEA THE FINAL WORD IS SPOKEN I AM SIGNED AND SEALED TO NATURE
