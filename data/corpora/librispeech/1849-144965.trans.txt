1849-144965-0000 QUITE UNINTENTIONALLY ON HIS PART MAN THE ARCH DESTROYER AND THE MOST PREDATORY AND MERCILESS OF ALL ANIMAL SPECIES EXCEPT THE WOLVES HAS RENDERED A GREAT SERVICE TO ALL THE BIRDS THAT LIVE OR NEST UPON THE GROUND
1849-144965-0001 IF THE TEETH AND CLAWS HAD BEEN PERMITTED TO MULTIPLY UNCHECKED DOWN TO THE PRESENT TIME WITH MAN'S WARFARE ON THE UPLAND GAME PROCEEDING AS IT HAS DONE SCORES UPON SCORES OF SPECIES
1849-144965-0002 LONG ERE THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN EXTERMINATED BUT THE SLAUGHTER OF THE MILLIONS OF NORTH AMERICAN FOXES WOLVES WEASELS SKUNKS AND MINK HAS SO OVERWHELMINGLY REDUCED THE FOUR FOOTED ENEMIES OF THE BIRDS
1849-144965-0003 AS A RULE THE FEW PREDATORY WILD ANIMALS THAT REMAIN ARE NOT SLAUGHTERING THE BIRDS TO A SERIOUS EXTENT AND FOR THIS WE MAY WELL BE THANKFUL THE DOMESTIC CAT
1849-144965-0004 WILL DOUBT THIS STATEMENT BUT THE PROOF OF ITS TRUTHFULNESS IS ONLY TOO PAINFULLY ABUNDANT
1849-144965-0005 AND TO KILL THE VERY BIRDS THAT ARE MOST FRIENDLY WITH MAN AND MOST HELPFUL TO HIM IN HIS FARMING AND FRUIT GROWING BUSINESS THE QUAIL IS ABOUT THE ONLY GAME BIRD THAT THE CAT AFFECTS SERIOUSLY AND TO IT THE CAT IS VERY DESTRUCTIVE
1849-144965-0006 IT IS THE ROBIN CATBIRD THRUSH BLUEBIRD DOVE WOODPECKER CHICKADEE PHOEBE TANAGER AND OTHER BIRDS OF THE LAWN THE GARDEN AND ORCHARD THAT AFFORD GOOD HUNTING FOR SLY AND SAVAGE OLD THOMAS
1849-144965-0007 WHEN I WAS A BOY IN MY TEENS I HAD A LASTING SERIES OF OBJECT LESSONS ON THE CAT AS A PREDATORY ANIMAL OUR BETTY WAS THE MOST AMBITIOUS AND SUCCESSFUL DOMESTIC CAT HUNTER OF WILD MAMMALS
1849-144965-0008 TO HER RATS AND MICE WERE MERE CHILD'S PLAY
1849-144965-0009 IN CONSIDERING THE HUNTING CAT LET US CALL IN A CREDIBLE WITNESS OF THE EFFECTS OF DOMESTIC CATS ON THE BOB WHITE THE FOLLOWING IS AN EYE WITNESS REPORT BY ERNEST B BEARDSLEY IN OUTDOOR LIFE FOR APRIL NINETEEN TWELVE
1849-144965-0010 THE LOCALITY WAS WELLINGTON SUMNER COUNTY KANSAS IN THE MEANTIME OLD QUEEN WAS HAVING A HIGH OLD TIME UP AHEAD SOME HUNDRED FEET BY THEN RUNNING UP THE BANK AND BACK DOWN IN THE DRAW
1849-144965-0011 THAT MISTER CAT WAS BUSY WITH WHEN DISTURBED WELL WE FOLLOWED THE DRAW ACROSS THE FIELD AND GOT NINE OF A COVEY OF SIXTEEN THAT HAD BEEN AHEAD OF MISTER CAT AND ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK THAT EVENING WE KILLED ANOTHER WHITE AND GRAY CAT
1849-144965-0012 WHILE DRIVING HOME THAT NIGHT MISTER SAVAGE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD KILLED FIFTY OR MORE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS
1849-144965-0013 AND STAY RIGHT WITH THEM AND EVEN AFTER FEEDING ON TWO OR THREE THEY WILL LIE AND WATCH AND WHEN THE COVEY MOVES THEY MOVE WHEN EATING TIME COMES AROUND THEY ARE AT IT AGAIN AND TO A COVEY OF YOUNG BIRDS THEY ARE SURE DEATH TO THE WHOLE COVEY
1849-144965-0014 WELL WILL TOLD ME NEVER TO OVERLOOK A HOUSE CAT THAT I FOUND AS FAR AS A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM A FARM OR RANCH FOR IF THEY HAVE NOT ALREADY TURNED WILD THEY ARE LEARNING HOW EASY IT IS TO HUNT AND LIVE ON GAME AND ARE ALMOST AS BAD
1849-144965-0015 MY ADVICE IS DON'T LET TAME CATS GET AWAY WHEN FOUND OUT HUNTING FOR THE CHANCES ARE THEY HAVE NOT SEEN A HOME IN MONTHS AND MAYBE YEARS AND SAY BUT THEY DO GET BIG AND BAD WHEN YOU MEET ONE
1849-144965-0016 THEY ESTABLISH THEMSELVES IN A DAY AND QUICKLY LEARN WHERE TO SEEK EASY GAME AND GOOD COVER IN THE DAYTIME THEY LIE CLOSE IN THE THICK BRUSH EXACTLY AS TIGERS DO IN INDIA BUT IF NOT MOLESTED FOR A PERIOD OF DAYS THEY BECOME BOLD
1849-144965-0017 AND ATTACK GAME IN OPEN VIEW ONE BIRD KILLING CAT WAS SO SHY OF MAN THAT IT WAS ONLY AFTER TWO WEEKS OF HARD HUNTING MORNINGS AND EVENINGS THAT IT WAS KILLED WE HAVE SEEN CATS
1849-144965-0018 CATCH AND KILL GRAY SQUIRRELS CHIPMUNKS ROBINS AND THRUSHES
1849-144965-0019 THEN THE CATS BEGAN UPON THEM AND IN ONE YEAR THERE WAS NOT A RABBIT TO BE SEEN SAVE AT RARE INTERVALS AT THE SAME TIME THE CHIPMUNKS OF THE PARK WERE ALMOST EXTERMINATED THAT WAS THE LAST STRAW AND WE BEGAN A
1849-144965-0020 WE ELIMINATED THAT PEST AND WE ARE KEEPING IT ELIMINATED AND WITH WHAT RESULT IN NINETEEN ELEVEN A COVEY OF ELEVEN QUAIL CAME AND SETTLED IN OUR GROUNDS AND HAVE REMAINED THERE
1849-144965-0021 NOT MORE THAN FORTY FEET FROM THE REAR WINDOW OF MY OFFICE LAST SPRING WHEN I LEFT THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING AT SIX O'CLOCK AFTER THE VISITORS HAD GONE I FOUND TWO HALF GROWN RABBITS CALMLY ROOSTING ON THE DOOR MAT
1849-144965-0022 THE RABBITS ARE SLOWLY COMING BACK AND THE CHIPMUNKS ARE VISIBLY INCREASING IN NUMBER THE GRAY SQUIRRELS NOW CHASE OVER THE WALKS WITHOUT FEAR OF ANY LIVING THING AND OUR DUCKLINGS AND YOUNG GUINEAS AND PEACOCKS ARE SAFE ONCE MORE
1849-144965-0023 SEVERAL MILLIONS OF VERY VALUABLE BIRDS SEEMS FAIRLY BEYOND QUESTION I BELIEVE THAT IN SETTLED REGIONS THEY ARE WORSE THAN WEASELS FOXES
1849-144965-0024 BECAUSE THERE ARE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TIMES AS MANY OF THEM AND THOSE THAT HUNT ARE NOT AFRAID TO HUNT IN THE DAYTIME OF COURSE
1849-144965-0025 BUT IN THE COUNTRY I BELIEVE THAT FULLY ONE HALF OF THEM DO I AM PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED WITH A CAT IN INDIANA ON THE FARM OF RELATIVES WHICH IS NOTORIOUS FOR ITS HUNTING PROPENSITIES AND ITS REMARKABLE ABILITY IN CAPTURING GAME
1849-144965-0026 EVEN THE LADY WHO IS JOINT OWNER OF THE CAT FEELS VERY BADLY ABOUT ITS DESTRUCTIVENESS AND HAS SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT IT OUGHT TO BE KILLED BUT THE CAT IS SUCH A FAMILY PET THAT NO ONE IN THE FAMILY HAS THE HEART TO DESTROY IT
1849-144965-0027 THE LADY IN QUESTION ASSURED ME THAT TO HER CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE THAT PARTICULAR CAT WOULD WATCH A NESTFUL OF YOUNG ROBINS WEEK AFTER WEEK
1849-144965-0028 THEN HE WOULD KILL THEM AND DEVOUR THEM OLD TOMMY WAS TOO WISE TO KILL THE ROBINS WHEN THEY WERE UNDULY SMALL IN A GREAT BOOK ENTITLED USEFUL BIRDS AND THEIR PROTECTION BY E H FORBUSH
1849-144965-0029 STATE ORNITHOLOGIST OF MASSACHUSETTS AND PUBLISHED BY THE MASSACHUSETTS STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE IN NINETEEN O FIVE THERE APPEARS ON PAGE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO MANY INTERESTING FACTS ON THIS SUBJECT FOR EXAMPLE
1849-144965-0030 MISTER WILLIAM BREWSTER TELLS OF AN ACQUAINTANCE IN MAINE WHO SAID THAT HIS CAT KILLED ABOUT FIFTY BIRDS A YEAR MISTER A C DIKE WROTE TO MISTER FORBUSH OF A CAT OWNED BY A FAMILY AND WELL CARED FOR
1849-144965-0031 THEY WATCHED IT THROUGH ONE SEASON AND FOUND THAT IT KILLED FIFTY EIGHT BIRDS INCLUDING THE YOUNG IN FIVE NESTS NEARLY A HUNDRED CORRESPONDENTS SCATTERED THROUGH ALL THE COUNTIES OF THE STATE
1849-144965-0032 REPORT THE CAT AS ONE OF THE GREATEST ENEMIES OF BIRDS
1849-144965-0033 ARE ABSOLUTELY SICKENING THE NUMBER OF BIRDS KILLED BY THEM IN THIS STATE IS APPALLING SOME CAT LOVERS BELIEVE THAT EACH CAT KILLS ON THE AVERAGE NOT MORE THAN TEN BIRDS A YEAR BUT I HAVE LEARNED OF TWO INSTANCES
1849-144965-0034 AND THAT THERE IS ONE CAT TO EACH FARM IN MASSACHUSETTS WE HAVE IN ROUND NUMBERS
1849-144965-0035 TO ENACT A LAW REQUIRING CATS TO BE LICENSED ON ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF WORK NECESSARY IN PASSING THE NO SALE OF GAME BILL THAT MEASURE WAS NOT PRESSED
1849-144965-0036 BUT ANOTHER YEAR IT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE PASSED FOR IT IS A GOOD BILL AND EXTREMELY NECESSARY AT THIS TIME SUCH A LAW IS NEEDED IN EVERY STATE THERE IS A MARK BY WHICH YOU MAY INSTANTLY AND INFALLIBLY KNOW
1849-144965-0037 THE WORST OF THE WILD CATS
1849-144965-0038 KILL ALL SUCH WHEREVER FOUND THE HARMLESS CATS ARE DOMESTIC IN THEIR TASTES AND STAY CLOSE TO THE FAMILY FIRESIDE AND THE KITCHEN BEING PROPERLY FED THEY HAVE NO TEMPTATION TO BECOME HUNTERS THERE ARE CATS AND CATS
1849-144965-0039 THE FARMER CANNOT AFFORD THE LUXURY OF THEIR EXISTENCE IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE WITH HIM IT IS A MATTER OF DOLLARS AND CASH OUT OF POCKET FOR EVERY HUNTING CAT THAT HE TOLERATES IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD THERE ARE TWO PLACES
1849-144965-0040 IN WHICH TO STRIKE THE HUNTING CATS IN THE OPEN AND IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE WHILE THIS CHAPTER WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE COMPOSITORS THE HUNTING CAT AND GRAY RABBIT SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING ILLUSTRATION WERE BROUGHT IN BY A KEEPER
1849-144965-0041 DOGS AS DESTROYERS OF BIRDS I HAVE RECEIVED MANY LETTERS FROM PROTECTORS OF WILD LIFE INFORMING ME THAT THE DESTRUCTION OF GROUND NESTING BIRDS AND ESPECIALLY OF UPLAND GAME BIRDS BY ROAMING DOGS
1849-144965-0042 HAS IN SOME LOCALITIES BECOME A GREAT CURSE TO BIRD LIFE COMPLAINTS OF THIS KIND HAVE COME FROM NEW YORK MASSACHUSETTS CONNECTICUT PENNSYLVANIA AND ELSEWHERE USUALLY THE CULPRITS ARE HUNTING DOGS SETTERS POINTERS AND HOUNDS
1849-144965-0043 NOW SURELY IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SET FORTH HERE ANY ARGUMENT ON THIS SUBJECT IT IS NOT OPEN TO ARGUMENT OR ACADEMIC TREATMENT OF ANY KIND THE COLD FACT IS IN THE BREEDING SEASON OF BIRDS
1849-144965-0044 AND WHILE THE YOUNG BIRDS ARE INCAPABLE OF QUICK AND STRONG FLIGHT ALL DOGS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION SHOULD BE RESTRAINED FROM FREE HUNTING AND ALL DOGS FOUND HUNTING IN THE WOODS DURING THE SEASON REFERRED TO SHOULD BE ARRESTED
1849-144965-0045 AND THEIR OWNERS SHOULD BE FINED TWENTY DOLLARS FOR EACH OFFENSE INCIDENTALLY ONE HALF THE FINE SHOULD GO TO THE CITIZEN WHO ARRESTS THE DOG THE METHOD OF RESTRAINING HUNTING DOGS SHOULD DEVOLVE UPON DOG OWNERS
1849-144965-0046 AND THE LAW NEED ONLY PROHIBIT OR PUNISH THE ACT BEYOND A DOUBT IN STATES THAT STILL POSSESS QUAIL AND RUFFED GROUSE FREE HUNTING BY HUNTING DOGS LEADS TO GREAT DESTRUCTION OF NESTS AND BROODS DURING THE BREEDING SEASON
1849-144965-0047 TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE WIRES MISTER DANIEL C BEARD HAS STRONGLY CALLED MY ATTENTION TO THE SLAUGHTER OF BIRDS BY TELEGRAPH WIRES THAT HAS COME UNDER HIS PERSONAL OBSERVATION
1849-144965-0048 HIS COUNTRY HOME AT REDDING CONNECTICUT IS NEAR THE MAIN LINE OF THE NEW YORK NEW HAVEN AND HARTFORD RAILWAY ALONG WHICH A LINE OF VERY LARGE POLES CARRIES A GREAT NUMBER OF WIRES THE WIRES ARE SO NUMEROUS
1849-144965-0049 THAT THEY FORM A BARRIER THROUGH WHICH IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ANY BIRD TO FLY AND COME OUT ALIVE AND UNHURT MISTER BEARD SAYS THAT AMONG THE BIRDS KILLED OR CRIPPLED BY FLYING AGAINST THOSE WIRES NEAR REDDING HE HAS SEEN THE FOLLOWING SPECIES
1849-144965-0050 TO FOLLOW THE LINE AND PICK UP ON ONE EXCURSION ENOUGH BIRDS FOR A POT PIE BEYOND QUESTION
1849-144965-0051 AND CLAIM COUNTLESS THOUSANDS OF VICTIMS THEY MAY WELL BE SET DOWN AS ONE OF THE UNSEEN FORCES DESTRUCTIVE TO BIRDS NATURALLY WE ASK WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT
1849-144965-0052 TO THE TELEPHONE WIRES AT INTERVALS OF A FEW RODS SUFFICIENTLY NEAR THAT THEY ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF FLYING BIRDS AND REVEAL THE LINE OF AN OBSTRUCTION THIS SYSTEM SHOULD BE ADOPTED IN ALL REGIONS WHERE THE CONDITIONS ARE SUCH THAT BIRDS KILL THEMSELVES
1849-144965-0053 AGAINST TELEGRAPH WIRES AND AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO BEGIN WOULD BE ALONG THE LINE
1849-144965-0054 WEASELS AND FOXES AND SKUNKS ARE INTERESTING AND THEY DO MUCH TO PROMOTE THE HILARITY OF LIFE IN RURAL DISTRICTS BUT THEY DO NOT DESTROY INSECTS AND ARE OF COMPARATIVELY LITTLE VALUE AS DESTROYERS OF THE NOXIOUS RODENTS THAT PREY UPON FARM CROPS
1849-144965-0055 AND PERSISTENT DESTROYERS OF NOXIOUS RODENTS POCKET GOPHERS MOLES FIELD MICE AND RATS OR THAT THEY DO NOT KILL WILD BIRDS NUMEROUSLY NOW IS THE TIME TO PRODUCE IT BECAUSE THE TIDE OF PUBLIC SENTIMENT IS STRONGLY SETTING AGAINST THE WEASELS
1849-144965-0056 MINK FOXES AND SKUNKS ONCE UPON A TIME A SHREWD YOUNG MAN IN THE ZOOLOGICAL PARK DISCOVERED A WEASEL HIDING BEHIND A STONE WHILE DEVOURING A SPARROW THAT IT HAD JUST CAUGHT AND KILLED HE STALKED IT SUCCESSFULLY
1849-144965-0057 SEIZED IT IN HIS BARE HAND AND EVEN THOUGH BITTEN MADE GOOD THE CAPTURE THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA IS EXTENSIVELY WOODED WITH FORESTS AND WITH BRUSH WHICH AFFORDS EXCELLENT HOME QUARTERS AND BREEDING GROUNDS FOR MAMMALIAN VERMIN
1849-144965-0058 A PORTION OF THE SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT IT WILL PRODUCE EACH YEAR WILL BE USED BY THE COMMISSION IN PAYING BOUNTIES ON THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SURPLUS OF VERMIN THROUGH THE PURSUIT OF VERMIN
1849-144965-0059 ANY FARMER CAN EASILY WIN ENOUGH BOUNTIES TO MORE THAN PAY THE COST OF HIS ANNUAL HUNTING LICENSE ONE DOLLAR AND THE FARMERS BOYS WILL FIND A NEW INTEREST IN LIFE
1849-144965-0060 THAT THEIR NUMBER HAD TO BE SYSTEMATICALLY REDUCED TO THAT END BUFFALO JONES WAS SENT OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO FIND AND DESTROY THE INTOLERABLE SURPLUS OF PUMAS IN THE COURSE OF HIS CAMPAIGN HE KILLED ABOUT FORTY MUCH TO THE BENEFIT OF THE ELK HERDS
1849-144965-0061 AROUND THE ENTRANCE TO THE DEN OF A BIG OLD MALE PUMA MISTER JONES FOUND THE SKULLS AND OTHER REMAINS OF NINE ELK CALVES THAT THE OLD TOM HAD KILLED AND CARRIED THERE PUMAS AND LYNXES ATTACK AND KILL MOUNTAIN SHEEP
1849-144965-0062 AND THE GOLDEN EAGLE IS VERY PARTIAL TO MOUNTAIN SHEEP LAMBS AND MOUNTAIN GOAT KIDS IT WILL NOT ANSWER TO PERMIT BIRDS OF THAT BOLD AND PREDATORY SPECIES TO BECOME TOO NUMEROUS IN MOUNTAINS INHABITED BY GOATS AND SHEEP AND THE FEWER THE MOUNTAIN LIONS THE BETTER
1849-144965-0063 FOR THEY LIKE THE LYNX AND EAGLE HAVE NOTHING TO LIVE UPON SAVE THE GAME THE WOLVES AND COYOTES HAVE LEARNED TO SEEK THE RANGES OF CATTLE HORSES AND SHEEP WHERE THEY STILL DO IMMENSE DAMAGE CHIEFLY IN KILLING YOUNG STOCK
1849-144965-0064 FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF WOLVES IN MANY MANY PLACES THE GRAY WOLF STILL PERSISTS AND CAN NOT BE EXTERMINATED TO THE STOCKMEN OF THE WEST THE WOLF QUESTION IS A SERIOUS MATTER THE STOCKMEN OF MONTANA SAY THAT A GOVERNMENT EXPERT ONCE TOLD THEM HOW TO GET RID OF THE GRAY WOLVES
1849-144965-0065 WILD CREATURES UNEXPECTEDLY INCREASE IN NUMBER AND A COMMUNITY AWAKENS TO THE FACT THAT SOME WILD SPECIES HAS BECOME A PUBLIC NUISANCE IN A SMALL CITY PARK EVEN GRAY SQUIRRELS MAY BREED AND BECOME SO FEARFULLY NUMEROUS
1849-144965-0066 THAT IN THEIR RESTLESS QUEST FOR FOOD THEY MAY RAVAGE THE NESTS OF THE WILD BIRDS KILL AND DEVOUR THE YOUNG AND BECOME A PEST IN THE ZOOLOGICAL PARK IN NINETEEN O THREE WE FOUND THAT THE RED SQUIRRELS HAD INCREASED TO SUCH A HORDE
1849-144965-0067 OR WHATEVER HIS NUMERICAL STRENGTH THE RED SQUIRREL IS A BAD CITIZEN AND WHILE WE DO NOT BY ANY MEANS FAVOR HIS EXTERMINATION HE SHOULD RESOLUTELY BE KEPT WITHIN BOUNDS BY THE RIFLE
1849-144965-0068 WHEN A CROW NESTED IN OUR WOODS NEAR THE BEAVER POND WE WERE GREATLY PLEASED BUT WITH THE FEEDING OF THE FIRST BROOD
1849-144965-0069 FOR THEIR DESTRUCTIVENESS OF USEFUL BIRDS WITHOUT ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WORTH MENTIONING FOUR OF THESE ARE COOPER'S HAWK THE SHARP SHINNED HAWK PIGEON HAWK AND DUCK HAWK FORTUNATELY THESE SPECIES ARE NOT SO NUMEROUS
1849-144965-0070 THAT WE NEED LOSE ANY SLEEP OVER THEM INDEED I THINK THAT TODAY IT WOULD BE A MIGHTY GOOD COLLECTOR WHO COULD FIND ONE SPECIMEN IN SEVEN DAYS HUNTING LIKE ALL OTHER SPECIES THESE TOO ARE BEING SHOT OUT OF OUR BIRD FAUNA
1849-144965-0071 SOME OF THEM ARE THE GREAT HORNED OWL SCREECH OWL BUTCHER BIRD OR GREAT NORTHERN SHRIKE THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT SAVES THESE BIRDS FROM INSTANT CONDEMNATION IS THE DELIGHTFUL AMOUNT OF RATS MICE
1849-144965-0072 MOLES GOPHERS AND NOXIOUS INSECTS THAT THEY ANNUALLY CONSUME
1849-144965-0073 WE ARE IMPELLED TO THINK LONG
1849-144965-0074 WHO REALLY DOES LEVY A HEAVY TAX ON OUR UPLAND GAME BIRDS AS TO THE BUTCHER BIRD WE FEEL THAT WE OUGHT TO KILL HIM BUT IN VIEW OF HIS RECORD ON WILD MICE AND RATS WE HESITATE AND FINALLY DECLINE
1849-144965-0075 A SPECIES TO BE DESTROYED
1849-144965-0076 SNAKES MISTER THOMAS M UPP A CLOSE AND LONG OBSERVER OF WILD THINGS WISHES IT DISTINCTLY UNDERSTOOD THAT WHILE THE COMMON BLACK SNAKES AND RACERS ARE PRACTICALLY HARMLESS TO BIRDS
1849-144965-0077 THE PILOT BLACK SNAKE LONG THICK AND TRUCULENT IS A GREAT SCOURGE TO NESTING BIRDS IT SEEMS TO BE DESERVING OF DEATH
1849-144965-0078 IS QUITE SWEEPING AT THE SAME TIME MISTER RAYMOND L DITMARS POINTS OUT THE FACT THAT THIS SERPENT FEEDS DURING SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR ON MICE
