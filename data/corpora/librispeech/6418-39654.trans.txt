6418-39654-0000 HIS EMINENCE CAME IN SOFTLY LIGHTLY AND AS SILENTLY AS A SHADOW AND SURPRISED THE COUNTENANCE OF THE COMTE AS HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO PRETENDING
6418-39654-0001 TO DIVINE BY THE SIMPLE EXPRESSION OF THE FACE OF HIS INTERLOCUTOR WHAT WOULD BE THE RESULT OF THE CONVERSATION BUT THIS TIME
6418-39654-0002 HE READ NOTHING UPON THE FACE OF ATHOS NOT EVEN THE RESPECT HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SEE ON ALL FACES
6418-39654-0003 RUMMAGED A LONG TIME IN HIS SOMEWHAT TROUBLED MEMORY TO RECALL THE NAME HE OUGHT TO GIVE TO THIS ICY FIGURE BUT HE DID NOT SUCCEED I AM TOLD SAID HE AT LENGTH YOU HAVE A MESSAGE FROM ENGLAND FOR ME
6418-39654-0004 AND HE SAT DOWN
6418-39654-0005 GRACIOUSLY LOOKING THROUGH HIS FINGERS AT THE HOLY GHOST GARTER AND GOLDEN FLEECE BUT MORE PARTICULARLY AT THE FACE OF THE MESSENGER I AM NOT AN ENGLISHMAN BUT A FRENCHMAN MONSIEUR LE CARDINAL
6418-39654-0006 IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THE KING OF ENGLAND SHOULD CHOOSE A FRENCHMAN FOR HIS AMBASSADOR IT IS AN EXCELLENT AUGURY
6418-39654-0007 TO THE THRONE OF HIS ANCESTORS THIS SHADE DID NOT ESCAPE HIS CUNNING EMINENCE
6418-39654-0008 WAS TOO MUCH ACCUSTOMED TO MANKIND NOT TO SEE IN THE COLD
6418-39654-0009 AN INDEX OF HOSTILITY WHICH WAS NOT OF THE TEMPERATURE OF THAT HOT HOUSE CALLED A COURT
6418-39654-0010 IN A SHORT QUERULOUS TONE YES MONSEIGNEUR AND THE WORD MONSEIGNEUR CAME SO PAINFULLY FROM THE LIPS OF ATHOS THAT IT MIGHT BE SAID IT SKINNED THEM
6418-39654-0011 A DISPATCH THE CARDINAL HELD OUT HIS HAND FOR IT
6418-39654-0012 SAID ATHOS MY DISPATCH IS FOR THE KING SINCE YOU ARE A FRENCHMAN MONSIEUR YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THE POSITION OF A PRIME MINISTER AT THE COURT OF FRANCE THERE WAS A TIME REPLIED ATHOS
