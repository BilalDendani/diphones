3928-153302-0000 I SHALL SEE ABOUT THIS HE MUTTERED CRUMPLING THE PAPER IN HIS HAND BUT THIS IS A VERY TERRIBLE BUSINESS YOU ARE PLUNGING ME INTO I SINCERELY HOPE THAT YOU ARE NOT HEEDLESSLY MISLEADING ME
3928-153302-0001 YOUR EYE WAS NOT ON HIM AS MINE WAS WHEN YOU MADE YOUR APPEARANCE IN THE HALL WITH THE RECOVERED JEWEL HE SHOWED ASTONISHMENT EAGERNESS
3928-153302-0002 WITH THE REQUEST TO TAKE THE DIAMOND IN HIS HAND
3928-153302-0003 IS IT LIKELY SIR IS IT CONCEIVABLE EVEN THAT ANY SUCH CRY AS WE HEARD COULD IN THIS DAY AND GENERATION
3928-153302-0004 UNLESS IT CAME WITH VENTRILOQUIAL POWER FROM HIS OWN LIPS YOU OBSERVED THAT HE TURNED HIS BACK THAT HIS FACE WAS HIDDEN FROM US DISCREET AND RETICENT
3928-153302-0005 YET HE DID STOP TO ARGUE SAYING IN THE NEXT BREATH YOU FORGET THAT THE STONE HAS A SETTING WOULD YOU CLAIM THAT THIS GENTLEMAN OF FAMILY PLACE AND POLITICAL DISTINCTION HAD PLANNED THIS HIDEOUS CRIME WITH SUFFICIENT PREMEDITATION
3928-153302-0006 YOU WOULD MAKE HIM OUT A CAGLIOSTRO OR SOMETHING WORSE MISS VAN ARSDALE I FEAR YOUR THEORY WILL TOPPLE OVER OF ITS OWN WEIGHT HE WAS VERY PATIENT WITH ME HE DID NOT SHOW ME THE DOOR YET SUCH A SUBSTITUTION TOOK PLACE
3928-153302-0007 AND TOOK PLACE THAT EVENING I INSISTED
3928-153302-0008 NAME TO ENGLAND NO INSPECTOR UNCLE HAS A CODE AND I MADE USE OF IT TO ASK A FRIEND IN LONDON FOR A LIST OF THE MOST NOTED DIAMOND FANCIERS IN THE COUNTRY MISTER GREY'S NAME WAS THIRD ON THE LIST
3928-153302-0009 WE LOVE EACH OTHER AND TO HER I DARED APPEAL ON ONE POINT INSPECTOR HERE MY VOICE UNCONSCIOUSLY FELL AS HE IMPETUOUSLY DREW NEARER A NOTE WAS SENT FROM THAT SICK CHAMBER ON THE NIGHT OF THE BALL A NOTE SURREPTITIOUSLY WRITTEN BY MISS GREY
3928-153302-0010 WHILE THE NURSE WAS IN AN ADJOINING ROOM THE MESSENGER WAS MISTER GREY'S VALET AND ITS DESTINATION THE HOUSE IN WHICH HER FATHER WAS ENJOYING HIS POSITION AS CHIEF GUEST SHE SAYS THAT IT WAS MEANT FOR HIM BUT I HAVE DARED TO THINK
3928-153302-0011 THAT THE VALET WOULD TELL A DIFFERENT STORY MY FRIEND DID NOT SEE WHAT HER PATIENT WROTE BUT SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IF HER PATIENT WROTE MORE THAN TWO WORDS THE RESULT MUST HAVE BEEN AN UNINTELLIGIBLE SCRAWL SINCE SHE WAS TOO WEAK TO HOLD A PENCIL FIRMLY
3928-153302-0012 WHICH HAD ALREADY FIGURED IN THE INQUEST AS THE MYSTERIOUS COMMUNICATION TAKEN FROM MISSUS FAIRBROTHER'S HAND BY THE CORONER
3928-153302-0013 YES THE PENCIL WAS AT HER BEDSIDE THE PAPER WAS TORN FROM A BOOK WHICH LAY THERE SHE DID NOT PUT THE NOTE WHEN WRITTEN IN AN ENVELOPE BUT GAVE IT TO THE VALET JUST AS IT WAS HE IS AN OLD MAN AND HAD COME TO HER ROOM FOR SOME FINAL ORDERS
3928-153302-0014 THE NURSE SAW ALL THIS HAS SHE THAT BOOK NO IT WENT OUT NEXT MORNING WITH THE SCRAPS IT WAS SOME PAMPHLET I BELIEVE
3928-153302-0015 WHAT IS THIS NURSE'S NAME HENRIETTA PIERSON DOES SHE SHARE YOUR DOUBTS
3928-153302-0016 NO ONLY THE ONE TIME IS SHE DISCREET VERY ON THIS SUBJECT SHE WILL BE LIKE THE GRAVE UNLESS FORCED BY YOU TO SPEAK AND MISS GREY SHE IS STILL ILL
3928-153302-0017 TOO ILL TO BE DISTURBED BY QUESTIONS ESPECIALLY ON SO DELICATE A TOPIC
3928-153302-0018 AND MY ABOMINABLE THEORY I COULD NOT GATHER HIS INTENTIONS FROM HIS EXPRESSION AND WAS FEELING VERY FAINT
3928-153302-0019 A GIRL AS ILL AS YOU SAY MISS GREY WAS MUST HAVE HAD SOME VERY PRESSING MATTER ON HER MIND TO ATTEMPT TO WRITE AND SEND A MESSAGE UNDER SUCH DIFFICULTIES
3928-153302-0020 AND I AN AGENT OF CRIME OTHER THAN ONE OF ENGLAND'S MOST REPUTABLE STATESMEN SO THAT MISTER DURAND IS SHOWN THE SAME CONSIDERATION I AM CONTENT SAID I IT IS THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH ONLY I DESIRE
3928-153302-0021 I AM WILLING TO TRUST MY CAUSE WITH YOU HE LOOKED NONE TOO GRATEFUL FOR THIS CONFIDENCE INDEED NOW THAT I LOOK BACK ON THIS SCENE I DO NOT WONDER THAT HE SHRANK FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY THUS FOISTED UPON HIM
3928-153302-0022 OR IF PROOF IS NOT POSSIBLE PRAY ALLOW ME THE PRIVILEGE OF DOING WHAT I CAN MYSELF TO CLEAR UP THE MATTER YOU THERE WAS APPREHENSION DISAPPROBATION ALMOST MENACE IN HIS TONE I BORE IT
3928-153302-0023 WITH AS STEADY AND MODEST A GLANCE AS POSSIBLE SAYING WHEN I THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK AGAIN I WILL DO NOTHING WITHOUT YOUR SANCTION I REALIZE THE DANGERS OF THIS INQUIRY AND THE DISGRACE THAT WOULD FOLLOW IF OUR ATTEMPT WAS SUSPECTED BEFORE PROOF REACHED A POINT SUFFICIENT
3928-153302-0024 VERY HOWEVER HE ADDED SUDDENLY GROWING GRAVE SOMETHING I MUST ADMIT MAY BE EXCUSED A YOUNG GIRL WHO FINDS HERSELF FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE GUILT OF HER LOVER AND THAT OF A MAN ESTEEMED GREAT BY THE WORLD
3928-153302-0025 TURNING UPON ME WITH SOME SEVERITY HE DECLARED THERE ARE NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE CHANCES IN A THOUSAND THAT MY NEXT WORD TO YOU WILL BE TO PREPARE YOURSELF FOR MISTER DURAND'S ARRAIGNMENT AND TRIAL BUT AN INFINITESIMAL CHANCE REMAINS TO THE CONTRARY
