432-122743-0000 THEN I SHOULD BE READY ALL THE CHANCES WERE THAT AT THE END OF THAT TIME
432-122743-0001 NO VALUABLE TIME WOULD BE LOST BY THE POSTPONEMENT I SHOULD THEN HAVE BEEN IN OFFICE SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AND I BELIEVED MY SYSTEM AND MACHINERY WOULD BE SO WELL DEVELOPED THAT I COULD TAKE A HOLIDAY WITHOUT ITS WORKING ANY HARM
432-122743-0002 THE IRON AND STEEL MISSIONARIES OF MY FUTURE CIVILIZATION IN THESE WERE GATHERED TOGETHER THE BRIGHTEST YOUNG MINDS I COULD FIND AND I KEPT AGENTS OUT RAKING THE COUNTRY FOR MORE ALL THE TIME I WAS TRAINING A CROWD OF
432-122743-0003 FOR NOBODY WAS ALLOWED TO COME INTO THEIR PRECINCTS WITHOUT A SPECIAL PERMIT FOR I WAS AFRAID OF THE CHURCH I HAD STARTED A TEACHER FACTORY
432-122743-0004 I NOW HAD AN ADMIRABLE SYSTEM OF GRADED SCHOOLS IN FULL BLAST IN THOSE PLACES
432-122743-0005 PERMITTING NOTHING OF IT IN MY OTHER EDUCATIONAL BUILDINGS I COULD HAVE GIVEN MY OWN SECT THE PREFERENCE AND MADE EVERYBODY A PRESBYTERIAN WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO AFFRONT A LAW OF HUMAN NATURE
432-122743-0006 SPIRITUAL WANTS AND INSTINCTS ARE AS VARIOUS IN THE HUMAN FAMILY AS ARE PHYSICAL APPETITES
432-122743-0007 I WAS AFRAID OF A UNITED CHURCH IT MAKES A MIGHTY POWER THE MIGHTIEST CONCEIVABLE AND THEN WHEN IT BY AND BY GETS INTO SELFISH HANDS AS IT IS ALWAYS BOUND TO DO IT MEANS DEATH TO HUMAN LIBERTY
432-122743-0008 AND PARALYSIS TO HUMAN THOUGHT ALL MINES WERE ROYAL PROPERTY AND THERE WERE A GOOD MANY OF THEM THEY HAD FORMERLY BEEN WORKED AS SAVAGES ALWAYS WORK MINES
432-122743-0009 HOLES GRUBBED IN THE EARTH AND THE MINERAL BROUGHT UP IN SACKS OF HIDE BY HAND AT THE RATE OF A TON A DAY BUT I HAD BEGUN TO PUT THE MINING ON A SCIENTIFIC BASIS AS EARLY AS I COULD
432-122743-0010 YES I HAD MADE PRETTY HANDSOME PROGRESS WHEN SIR SAGRAMOR'S CHALLENGE STRUCK ME FOUR YEARS ROLLED BY AND THEN WELL
432-122743-0011 UNLIMITED POWER IS THE IDEAL THING WHEN IT IS IN SAFE HANDS THE DESPOTISM OF HEAVEN IS THE ONE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT GOVERNMENT
432-122743-0012 PERFECT EARTHLY GOVERNMENT IF THE CONDITIONS WERE THE SAME NAMELY THE DESPOT THE PERFECTEST INDIVIDUAL OF THE HUMAN RACE AND HIS LEASE OF LIFE PERPETUAL BUT AS A PERISHABLE PERFECT MAN MUST DIE
432-122743-0013 AND LEAVE HIS DESPOTISM IN THE HANDS OF AN IMPERFECT SUCCESSOR AN EARTHLY DESPOTISM IS NOT MERELY A BAD FORM OF GOVERNMENT IT IS THE WORST FORM THAT IS POSSIBLE
432-122743-0014 MY WORKS SHOWED WHAT A DESPOT COULD DO WITH THE RESOURCES OF A KINGDOM AT HIS COMMAND UNSUSPECTED BY THIS DARK LAND
432-122743-0015 IT WAS FENCED AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC VIEW BUT THERE IT WAS A GIGANTIC AND UNASSAILABLE FACT AND TO BE HEARD FROM YET IF I LIVED AND HAD LUCK THERE IT WAS
432-122743-0016 AS SURE A FACT AND AS SUBSTANTIAL A FACT AS ANY SERENE VOLCANO STANDING INNOCENT WITH ITS SMOKELESS SUMMIT IN THE BLUE SKY AND GIVING NO SIGN OF THE RISING HELL IN ITS BOWELS
432-122743-0017 IT WAS NOT MY POLICY THE PEOPLE COULD NOT HAVE STOOD IT AND MOREOVER I SHOULD HAVE HAD THE ESTABLISHED ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH ON MY BACK IN A MINUTE NO
432-122743-0018 MY MILITARY ACADEMY I KEPT THAT MOST JEALOUSLY OUT OF SIGHT AND I DID THE SAME WITH MY NAVAL ACADEMY WHICH I HAD ESTABLISHED AT A REMOTE SEAPORT BOTH WERE PROSPERING TO MY SATISFACTION
432-122743-0019 CLARENCE WAS TWENTY TWO NOW AND WAS MY HEAD EXECUTIVE MY RIGHT HAND HE WAS A DARLING HE WAS EQUAL TO ANYTHING THERE WASN'T ANYTHING HE COULDN'T TURN HIS HAND TO
432-122743-0020 OF LATE I HAD BEEN TRAINING HIM FOR JOURNALISM
432-122743-0021 HE TOOK TO IT LIKE A DUCK THERE WAS AN EDITOR CONCEALED IN HIM SURE ALREADY HE HAD DOUBLED HIMSELF IN ONE WAY HE TALKED SIXTH CENTURY AND WROTE NINETEENTH HIS JOURNALISTIC STYLE WAS CLIMBING STEADILY
432-122743-0022 IT WAS ALREADY UP TO THE BACK SETTLEMENT ALABAMA MARK AND COULDN'T BE TOLD FROM THE EDITORIAL OUTPUT OF THAT REGION EITHER BY MATTER OR FLAVOR WE HAD ANOTHER LARGE DEPARTURE ON HAND TOO
432-122743-0023 OUR FIRST VENTURE IN THIS LINE THESE WIRES WERE FOR PRIVATE SERVICE ONLY AS YET AND MUST BE KEPT PRIVATE UNTIL A RIPER DAY SHOULD COME WE HAD A GANG OF MEN ON THE ROAD WORKING MAINLY BY NIGHT
432-122743-0024 THEY WERE STRINGING GROUND WIRES WE WERE AFRAID TO PUT UP POLES FOR THEY WOULD ATTRACT TOO MUCH INQUIRY GROUND WIRES WERE GOOD ENOUGH IN BOTH INSTANCES FOR MY WIRES WERE PROTECTED BY AN INSULATION OF MY OWN INVENTION WHICH WAS PERFECT
432-122743-0025 NOBODY COULD TELL YOU HOW TO FIND ANY PLACE IN THE KINGDOM FOR NOBODY EVER WENT INTENTIONALLY TO ANY PLACE BUT ONLY STRUCK IT BY ACCIDENT IN HIS WANDERINGS AND THEN GENERALLY LEFT IT WITHOUT THINKING TO INQUIRE WHAT ITS NAME WAS
432-122743-0026 AT ONE TIME AND ANOTHER WE HAD SENT OUT TOPOGRAPHICAL EXPEDITIONS TO SURVEY AND MAP THE KINGDOM BUT THE PRIESTS HAD ALWAYS INTERFERED AND RAISED TROUBLE SO WE HAD GIVEN THE THING UP FOR THE PRESENT
432-122743-0027 BUT THEY WERE NECESSARILY SLIGHT AND THEY WERE NOT NOTICEABLE THUS FAR I HAD NOT EVEN MEDDLED WITH TAXATION OUTSIDE OF THE TAXES WHICH PROVIDED THE ROYAL REVENUES I HAD SYSTEMATIZED THOSE AND PUT THE SERVICE ON AN EFFECTIVE AND RIGHTEOUS BASIS
432-122743-0028 REVENUES WERE ALREADY QUADRUPLED AND YET THE BURDEN WAS SO MUCH MORE EQUABLY DISTRIBUTED THAN BEFORE THAT ALL THE KINGDOM FELT A SENSE OF RELIEF AND THE PRAISES OF MY ADMINISTRATION WERE HEARTY AND GENERAL
432-122743-0029 PERSONALLY I STRUCK AN INTERRUPTION NOW BUT I DID NOT MIND IT IT COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED AT A BETTER TIME
432-122743-0030 BUT NOW EVERYTHING WAS IN GOOD HANDS AND SWIMMING RIGHT ALONG THE KING HAD REMINDED ME SEVERAL TIMES OF LATE THAT THE POSTPONEMENT I HAD ASKED FOR FOUR YEARS BEFORE HAD ABOUT RUN OUT NOW
432-122743-0031 IT WAS A HINT THAT I OUGHT TO BE STARTING OUT TO SEEK ADVENTURES AND GET UP A REPUTATION OF A SIZE TO MAKE ME WORTHY OF THE HONOR OF BREAKING A LANCE WITH SIR SAGRAMOR WHO WAS STILL OUT GRAILING BUT WAS BEING HUNTED FOR BY
432-122743-0032 VARIOUS RELIEF EXPEDITIONS AND
