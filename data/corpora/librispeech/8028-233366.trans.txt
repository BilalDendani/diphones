8028-233366-0000 THE REST OF HIS ANCESTRY BEING ENGLISH OF LONG STANDING IN AMERICA WITH A VERY LITTLE ADMIXTURE OF DUTCH BLOOD HE IS FIVE FEET EIGHT INCHES IN HEIGHT AND HAS BROWN HAIR AND EYES
8028-233366-0001 IS SUBJECT TO TONSILLITIS AND A STUBBORN THOUGH NOT SEVERE FORM OF INDIGESTION INDUCED BY SEDENTARY HABITS HE IS OF QUICK NERVOUS TEMPERAMENT HAS AN AVERSION FROM MOST OUTDOOR SPORTS BUT A GREAT ESTHETIC ATTRACTION TO NATURE
8028-233366-0002 A COUSIN FIVE YEARS OLDER WAS IN THE BATHROOM SEATED AND M O WAS FEELING HIS SEXUAL ORGANS HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM OUT ON ANOTHER OCCASION HE WAS IN A WAGONHOUSE WITH A GIRL OF HIS OWN AGE THEY WERE LYING ON A CARRIAGE SEAT ATTEMPTING INTERCOURSE
8028-233366-0003 THE GIRL'S OLDER SISTER CAME IN AND FOUND THEM SHE SAID I AM GOING TO TELL MAMMA YOU KNOW SHE SAID FOR YOU NOT TO DO THAT ANY MORE WITH EACH OF THESE CLEAR MEMORIES COMES THE STRONG IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS BUT ONE AMONG MANY FIVE YEARS AGO
8028-233366-0004 M O MET A MAN OF HIS OWN AGE WHO HAD LIVED IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AT THE SAME TIME COMPARING NOTES THEY FOUND THAT NEARLY ALL THE SMALL CHILDREN IN IT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO SUCH PRACTICES
8028-233366-0005 FROM IT M O REMOVED TO ANOTHER OF JUST ABOUT THE SAME CHARACTER AND LIVED THERE UNTIL HE WAS ELEVEN YEARS OLD OF THIS PERIOD HIS MEMORIES ARE VERY FRESH AND ABUNDANT WITH A SINGLE EXCEPTION
8028-233366-0006 ALL THE CHILDREN BETWEEN FIVE AND FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE APPEAR TO HAVE INDULGED FREELY IN PROMISCUOUS SEXUAL PLAY IN LITTLE COMPANIES OF FROM FOUR TO TWELVE THEY WENT WHERE TREES OR LONG GRASS HID THEM FROM OBSERVATION
8028-233366-0007 AND EXHIBITED THEIR PERSONS TO ONE ANOTHER SOMETIMES ALSO THEY HANDLED ONE ANOTHER BUT NOT IN THE WAY OF MASTURBATION OF THIS LAST M O WAS WHOLLY IGNORANT
8028-233366-0008 THERE WAS EAGER SEXUAL CURIOSITY AND A MORE OR LESS KEEN DESIRE BUT ACTUAL CONTACT BROUGHT NO GREAT SATISFACTION ON TWO OR THREE OCCASIONS GIRLS PRACTISED FELLATIO AND HE THEN RECIPROCATED WITH CUNNILINCTUS BUT WITHOUT PLEASURE
8028-233366-0009 IN ALL THESE PLAYS HE IS SURE THAT GIRLS TOOK THE INITIATIVE AS OFTEN AS BOYS DID DURING ALL THIS PERIOD
8028-233366-0010 THIS WAS CONVENTIONAL AMONG THE CHILDREN AND WAS FOSTERED BY THE BANTER OF OLDER PERSONS
8028-233366-0011 AT THIS TIME HOWEVER HIS HOMOSEXUAL INTERESTS APPEARED WITH A BOY TWO OR MORE YEARS OLDER HE FREQUENTLY WENT TO SOME HIDING PLACE WHERE THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER'S ORGANS AND HANDLED THEM HE AND ANOTHER BOY WERE ONCE IN AN ABANDONED GARDEN
8028-233366-0012 AND THEY TOOK OFF ALL THEIR CLOTHES THE BETTER TO EXAMINE EACH OTHER
8028-233366-0013 IT CAUSED A SURPRISINGLY KEEN AND DISTINCTLY SEXUAL SENSATION THE FIRST SEXUAL SHOCK THAT HE CAN REMEMBER EXPERIENCING
8028-233366-0014 TOWARD THE END OF THIS PERIOD THERE WAS A NEW AND INCREASING DEVELOPMENT OF ANOTHER SORT NOT RECOGNIZED THEN AS AT ALL SEXUAL IN CHARACTER HE BEGAN TO FEEL TOWARD CERTAIN BOYS IN A WAY VERY DIFFERENT AND MUCH KEENER THAN HE HAD DONE THUS FAR TOWARD GIRLS
8028-233366-0015 ALTHOUGH AT THE TIME HE MADE NO COMPARISONS FOR INSTANCE THERE WAS A BOY WHOM HE CONSIDERED VERY PRETTY THEY VISITED EACH OTHER OFTEN AND SPENT LONG TIMES PLAYING TOGETHER IN SCHOOL THEY LOOKED AND LOOKED AT EACH OTHER UNTIL DELICIOUS
8028-233366-0016 UNCONTROLLABLE GIGGLING SPELLS CAME ON SEXUAL MATTERS WERE NEVER DISCUSSED OR THOUGHT OF THESE EXPERIENCES WERE IN THEIR WAY VERY SENTIMENTAL AND IDEAL M O IS SURE
8028-233366-0017 THAT WITH HIMSELF THE MAIN CONSIDERATION WAS ALWAYS THE OTHER BOY'S BEAUTY HE BEGAN TO RECALL WITH GREAT FONDNESS
8028-233366-0018 HE SELDOM SAW HIM NOW AND HARDLY SOUGHT TO DO SO YET WAS IMMENSELY PLEASED BY A CASUAL WORD OR LOOK FROM HIM IN THE SCHOOLYARD AND MUCH INTERESTED WHEN OTHER PEOPLE SPOKE OF HIM
8028-233366-0019 A COUSIN ABOUT TWO YEARS YOUNGER THAN M O OFTEN VISITED HIM AND SLEPT WITH HIM THEY WERE VERY FOND OF EACH OTHER AND HANDLED EACH OTHER'S ORGANS WHEN M O WAS ABOUT ELEVEN YEARS OF AGE THE FAMILY REMOVED TO A DISTANT NEIGHBORHOOD
8028-233366-0020 WHERE THERE WERE ALMOST NO CHILDREN OF HIS OWN AGE
8028-233366-0021 FROM THIS TIME UNTIL THE CHANGES OF PUBERTY WERE WELL UNDER WAY HIS SEXUAL LIFE CONTRASTED STRONGLY IN ITS SOLITUDE WITH THE FORMER PROMISCUITY
8028-233366-0022 HE THINKS THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF HIS SEXUAL IMPULSES HE FLIRTED CONSCIOUSLY FLIRTED WITH CERTAIN SCHOOL GIRLS BUT NEVER EVEN SUGGESTED ANYTHING SEXUAL TO THEM HE READ A FEW FAMILY MEDICAL BOOKS ONE DAY
8028-233366-0023 LYING ON AN OLD UNEVEN COUCH INNOCENTLY ENOUGH AT FIRST HE INDUCED A NEW AND DELICIOUS SENSATION ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT FROM ANY HE HAD EVER DREAMED OF SOMETHING FAR BEYOND THE SATISFACTION OF MERE CURIOSITY
8028-233366-0024 HE REPEATED THE THING AND BEFORE LONG PRODUCED EMISSIONS MASTURBATION SOON FOLLOWED CERTAIN DAYS HE WOULD PERFORM THE ACT TWO OR THREE TIMES BUT AGAIN HE WOULD AVOID IT FOR DAYS
8028-233366-0025 HE BEGAN AT ONCE TO FIGHT THE TENDENCY AND FELT VERY GUILTY AND VERY ASHAMED FOR INDULGING IT HE PRAYED FOR HELP AND AT TIMES WEPT OVER HIS FAILURES TO BREAK THE HABIT SO QUICKLY FORMED
8028-233366-0026 JUST THEN CERTAIN NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENTS FELL UNDER HIS EYE AND THESE PERSUADED HIM THAT HE HAD PRODUCED IN HIMSELF A DISEASED CONDITION
8028-233366-0027 HE NEVER RESORTED TO THE REMEDIES ADVERTISED BUT HE WAS DISCOURAGED IN HIS EFFORTS TO OVERCOME THE BAD HABIT AND SINCE THE EVIL EFFECTS APPEARED TO CONSIST ONLY IN THE SEMINAL LOSSES HE CONCLUDED THAT HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE THE GREATER ENJOYMENT OF MASTURBATION
8028-233366-0028 FOR A SHORT TIME HE REMEMBERS THAT HE HAD AN INTENSE BUT REVOLTING INTEREST IN THE SEXUAL ORGANS OF ANIMALS ESPECIALLY HORSES THE MALES WERE MUCH MORE INTERESTING
8028-233366-0029 GRADUALLY HE BEGAN TO DEVELOP ENTIRELY FROM WITHIN THE IDEAL OF A MALE COMRADE A BEAUTIFUL EMOTIONAL BOY BETWEEN WHOM AND HIMSELF THERE MIGHT EXIST A POWERFUL ROMANTIC PASSION
8028-233366-0030 HE LAY FOR HOURS DREAMING OF THIS AND INVENTING THRILLING SITUATIONS SUDDENLY AT CHURCH HE BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH THE VERY YOUTH EDMUND WHO SEEMED TO SATISFY ALL HIS LONGINGS
8028-233366-0031 A REAL WOOING ENSUED EDMUND FINALLY YIELDING TO THE PHYSICAL APPEALS OF M O AFTER SEVERAL FITS OF MISGIVING THE YIELDING WAS IN THE END COMPLETE HOWEVER THE TWO SPENT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT TOGETHER
8028-233366-0032 ENJOYING INTERCRURAL INTERCOURSE AND SOMETIMES MUTUAL MASTURBATION THEIR PARENTS MAY HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY UNEASY AT TIMES
8028-233366-0033 IN THE MEANTIME M O OCCASIONALLY HAD RELATIONS WITH OTHER BOYS BUT NEVER WAVERED IN HIS REAL PREFERENCE FOR EDMUND FOR GIRLS HE HAD NO SEXUAL DESIRE WHATEVER THOUGH HE WAS MUCH ASSOCIATED WITH THEM
8028-233366-0034 THEN M O AND EDMUND WENT TO COLLEGE AT DIFFERENT PLACES BUT THEY MET IN VACATIONS AND WROTE FREQUENT AND ARDENT LOVE LETTERS BOTH HAD GENUINE ATTACKS OF LOVE SICKNESS AND OF JEALOUSY AS M O LOOKS BACK ON THIS FIRST LOVE PASSION
8028-233366-0035 HE CAN BY NO MEANS REGRET IT IT DOUBTLESS HAD GREAT FORMATIVE INFLUENCE AFTER THE FIRST YEAR AT COLLEGE EDMUND TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER SCHOOL FARTHER AWAY FROM M O AND THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEETING BECAME RARER
8028-233366-0036 BUT THEIR AFFECTION WAS MAINTAINED AND THE INTERCOURSE RESUMED WHENEVER IT WAS POSSIBLE GRADUALLY HOWEVER EDMUND BECAME INTERESTED IN WOMEN AND FINALLY MARRIED M O ALSO FORMED RELATIONS REPEATEDLY WITH COLLEGE FRIENDS
8028-233366-0037 AND OCCASIONALLY WITH OTHERS ON THE WHOLE M O PREFERRED BOYS A YEAR OR TWO YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF BUT AS HE GREW OLDER THE AGE DIFFERENCE INCREASED
8028-233366-0038 ONE UNUSUALLY MATURE HOWEVER AND MUCH LARGER THAN HIMSELF M O IS ALWAYS UNHAPPY UNLESS HIS AFFECTIONS HAVE FAIRLY FREE COURSE LIFE HAS BEEN VERY DISAPPOINTING TO HIM IN OTHER RESPECTS
8028-233366-0039 HIS GREATEST JOYS HAVE COME TO HIM IN THIS WAY IF HE IS ABLE TO CONSUMMATE HIS PRESENT PLAN OF UNION WITH THE YOUTH JUST REFERRED TO HE WILL FEEL THAT HIS LIFE HAS BEEN CROWNED BY WHAT IS FOR HIM THE BEST POSSIBLE END OTHERWISE HE DECLARES
8028-233366-0040 HE WOULD NOT CARE TO LIVE AT ALL HE ADMIRES MALE BEAUTY PASSIONATELY FEMININE BEAUTY HE PERCEIVES OBJECTIVELY AS HE WOULD ANY DESIGN OF FLOWING CURVES AND DELICATE COLORING
8028-233366-0041 BUT IT HAS NO SEXUAL CHARM FOR HIM WHATEVER WOMEN HAVE PUT THEMSELVES IN HIS WAY REPEATEDLY BUT HE FINDS HIMSELF MORE AND MORE IRRITATED BY THEIR SPECIFICALLY FEMININE FOIBLES WITH MEN GENERALLY HE IS MUCH MORE PATIENT AND SYMPATHETIC
8028-233366-0042 THE FIRST LITERATURE THAT APPEALED TO HIM WAS PLATO'S DIALOGUES FIRST READ AT TWENTY YEARS OF AGE UNTIL THEN HE HAD NOT KNOWN BUT WHAT HE STOOD ALONE IN HIS PECULIARITY HE READ WHAT HE COULD OF CLASSIC LITERATURE HE ENJOYS PATER
8028-233366-0043 APPRECIATING HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD HIS OWN SEX FOUR OR FIVE YEARS LATER HE CAME ACROSS RAFFALOVICH'S BOOK AND EVER SINCE HAS FELT A REAL DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO ITS AUTHOR M O HAS NO WISH TO INJURE SOCIETY AT LARGE
8028-233366-0044 AS AN INDIVIDUAL HE HOLDS THAT HE HAS THE SAME RIGHT TO BE HIMSELF THAT ANYONE ELSE HAS HE THINKS THAT WHILE BOYS OF FROM THIRTEEN TO FIFTEEN MIGHT POSSIBLY BE RENDERED INVERTS THOSE WHO REACH SIXTEEN WITHOUT IT CANNOT BE BENT THAT WAY
8028-233366-0045 THEY MAY BE DEVOTED TO AN INVERT ENOUGH IN OTHER WAYS TO YIELD HIM WHAT HE WISHES SEXUALLY BUT THEY WILL REMAIN ESSENTIALLY NORMAL THEMSELVES HIS OBSERVATIONS ARE BASED ON ABOUT THIRTY HOMOSEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVE LASTED VARIOUS LENGTHS OF TIME
