5224-35456-0000 NIGHTMARE I HAD NOT CLOSED MY EYES THE NIGHT BEFORE ON THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AND WHAT OF THAT AND OF MY EXHAUSTION I SLEPT SOUNDLY WHEN I FIRST AWOKE IT WAS NIGHT
5224-35456-0001 GARTHWAITE HAD NOT RETURNED I HAD LOST MY WATCH AND HAD NO IDEA OF THE TIME AS I LAY WITH MY EYES CLOSED I HEARD THE SAME DULL SOUND OF DISTANT EXPLOSIONS THE INFERNO WAS STILL RAGING I CREPT THROUGH THE STORE TO THE FRONT
5224-35456-0002 THE REFLECTION FROM THE SKY OF VAST CONFLAGRATIONS MADE THE STREET ALMOST AS LIGHT AS DAY ONE COULD HAVE READ THE FINEST PRINT WITH EASE FROM SEVERAL BLOCKS AWAY CAME THE CRACKLE OF SMALL HAND BOMBS AND THE CHURNING OF MACHINE GUNS
5224-35456-0003 AND FROM A LONG WAY OFF CAME A LONG SERIES OF HEAVY EXPLOSIONS
5224-35456-0004 WHEN NEXT I AWOKE A SICKLY YELLOW LIGHT WAS FILTERING IN ON ME IT WAS DAWN OF THE SECOND DAY I CREPT TO THE FRONT OF THE STORE A SMOKE PALL SHOT THROUGH WITH LURID GLEAMS FILLED THE SKY
5224-35456-0005 DOWN THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET TOTTERED A WRETCHED SLAVE ONE HAND HE HELD TIGHTLY AGAINST HIS SIDE AND BEHIND HIM HE LEFT A BLOODY TRAIL HIS EYES ROVED EVERYWHERE AND THEY WERE FILLED WITH APPREHENSION AND DREAD ONCE HE LOOKED STRAIGHT ACROSS AT ME
5224-35456-0006 AND IN HIS FACE WAS ALL THE DUMB PATHOS OF THE WOUNDED AND HUNTED ANIMAL HE SAW ME
5224-35456-0007 AND WITH HIM AT LEAST NO SYMPATHY OF UNDERSTANDING FOR HE COWERED PERCEPTIBLY AND DRAGGED HIMSELF ON HE COULD EXPECT NO AID IN ALL GOD'S WORLD HE WAS A HELOT IN THE GREAT HUNT OF HELOTS THAT THE MASTERS WERE MAKING
5224-35456-0008 ALL HE COULD HOPE FOR ALL HE SOUGHT WAS SOME HOLE TO CRAWL AWAY IN AND HIDE LIKE ANY ANIMAL THE SHARP CLANG OF A PASSING AMBULANCE AT THE CORNER GAVE HIM A START AMBULANCES WERE NOT FOR SUCH AS HE WITH A GROAN OF PAIN HE THREW HIMSELF INTO A DOORWAY
5224-35456-0009 A MINUTE LATER HE WAS OUT AGAIN AND DESPERATELY HOBBLING ON
5224-35456-0010 MY HEADACHE HAD NOT GONE AWAY ON THE CONTRARY IT WAS INCREASING IT WAS BY AN EFFORT OF WILL ONLY THAT I WAS ABLE TO OPEN MY EYES AND LOOK AT OBJECTS AND WITH THE OPENING OF MY EYES AND THE LOOKING CAME INTOLERABLE TORMENT ALSO A GREAT PULSE WAS BEATING IN MY BRAIN
5224-35456-0011 WEAK AND REELING I WENT OUT THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOW AND DOWN THE STREET SEEKING TO ESCAPE INSTINCTIVELY AND GROPINGLY FROM THE AWFUL SHAMBLES AND THEREAFTER I LIVED NIGHTMARE
5224-35456-0012 MY MEMORY OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SUCCEEDING HOURS IS THE MEMORY ONE WOULD HAVE OF NIGHTMARE MANY EVENTS ARE FOCUSSED SHARPLY ON MY BRAIN BUT BETWEEN THESE INDELIBLE PICTURES I RETAIN ARE INTERVALS OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS WHAT OCCURRED IN THOSE INTERVALS I KNOW NOT AND NEVER SHALL KNOW
5224-35456-0013 I REMEMBER STUMBLING AT THE CORNER OVER THE LEGS OF A MAN IT WAS THE POOR HUNTED WRETCH THAT HAD DRAGGED HIMSELF PAST MY HIDING PLACE HOW DISTINCTLY DO I REMEMBER HIS POOR PITIFUL GNARLED HANDS AS HE LAY THERE ON THE PAVEMENT HANDS THAT WERE MORE HOOF AND CLAW THAN HANDS
5224-35456-0014 ALL TWISTED AND DISTORTED BY THE TOIL OF ALL HIS DAYS WITH ON THE PALMS A HORNY GROWTH OF CALLOUS A HALF INCH THICK AND AS I PICKED MYSELF UP AND STARTED ON I LOOKED INTO THE FACE OF THE THING AND SAW THAT IT STILL LIVED FOR THE EYES DIMLY INTELLIGENT WERE LOOKING AT ME
5224-35456-0015 AND SEEING ME AFTER THAT CAME A KINDLY BLANK I KNEW NOTHING SAW NOTHING MERELY TOTTERED ON IN MY QUEST FOR SAFETY MY NEXT NIGHTMARE VISION WAS A QUIET STREET OF THE DEAD
5224-35456-0016 I CAME UPON IT ABRUPTLY AS A WANDERER IN THE COUNTRY WOULD COME UPON A FLOWING STREAM ONLY THIS STREAM I GAZED UPON DID NOT FLOW IT WAS CONGEALED IN DEATH FROM PAVEMENT TO PAVEMENT AND COVERING THE SIDEWALKS IT LAY THERE SPREAD OUT QUITE EVENLY
5224-35456-0017 BUT THIS TIME IN A STREAM THAT FLOWED AND CAME ON AND THEN I SAW THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THE STREAM MOVED SLOWLY WHILE FROM IT AROSE GROANS AND LAMENTATIONS CURSINGS BABBLINGS OF SENILITY HYSTERIA AND INSANITY FOR THESE WERE THE VERY YOUNG AND THE VERY OLD
5224-35456-0018 THE FEEBLE AND THE SICK THE HELPLESS AND THE HOPELESS ALL THE WRECKAGE OF THE GHETTO THE BURNING OF THE GREAT GHETTO ON THE SOUTH SIDE HAD DRIVEN THEM FORTH INTO THE INFERNO OF THE STREET FIGHTING AND WHITHER THEY WENDED AND WHATEVER BECAME OF THEM I DID NOT KNOW AND NEVER LEARNED IT
5224-35456-0019 BUT IT IS DEFINITELY SETTLED NOW THAT THE GHETTO WAS FIRED BY THE MERCENARIES UNDER ORDERS FROM THEIR CHIEFS I HAVE FAINT MEMORIES OF BREAKING A WINDOW AND HIDING IN SOME SHOP TO ESCAPE A STREET MOB THAT WAS PURSUED BY SOLDIERS
5224-35456-0020 ALSO A BOMB BURST NEAR ME ONCE IN SOME STILL STREET WHERE LOOK AS I WOULD UP AND DOWN I COULD SEE NO HUMAN BEING BUT MY NEXT SHARP RECOLLECTION BEGINS WITH THE CRACK OF A RIFLE
5224-35456-0021 THE SHOT MISSED AND THE NEXT MOMENT I WAS SCREAMING AND MOTIONING THE SIGNALS MY MEMORY OF RIDING IN THE AUTOMOBILE IS VERY HAZY THOUGH THIS RIDE IN TURN IS BROKEN BY ONE VIVID PICTURE THE CRACK OF THE RIFLE OF THE SOLDIER SITTING BESIDE ME MADE ME OPEN MY EYES
5224-35456-0022 AND I SAW GEORGE MILFORD WHOM I HAD KNOWN IN THE PELL STREET DAYS SINKING SLOWLY DOWN TO THE SIDEWALK EVEN AS HE SANK THE SOLDIER FIRED AGAIN AND MILFORD DOUBLED IN
5224-35456-0023 THE SOLDIER CHUCKLED AND THE AUTOMOBILE SPED ON THE NEXT I KNEW AFTER THAT I WAS AWAKENED OUT OF A SOUND SLEEP BY A MAN WHO WALKED UP AND DOWN CLOSE BESIDE ME HIS FACE WAS DRAWN AND STRAINED AND THE SWEAT ROLLED DOWN HIS NOSE FROM HIS FOREHEAD
5224-35456-0024 ONE HAND WAS CLUTCHED TIGHTLY AGAINST HIS CHEST BY THE OTHER HAND AND BLOOD DRIPPED DOWN UPON THE FLOOR AS HE WALKED HE WORE THE UNIFORM OF THE MERCENARIES FROM WITHOUT AS THROUGH THICK WALLS CAME THE MUFFLED ROAR OF BURSTING BOMBS I WAS IN SOME BUILDING THAT WAS LOCKED IN COMBAT WITH SOME OTHER BUILDING
5224-35456-0025 A SURGEON CAME IN TO DRESS THE WOUNDED SOLDIER AND I LEARNED THAT IT WAS TWO IN THE AFTERNOON MY HEADACHE WAS NO BETTER AND THE SURGEON PAUSED FROM HIS WORK LONG ENOUGH TO GIVE ME A POWERFUL DRUG THAT WOULD DEPRESS THE HEART AND BRING RELIEF I SLEPT AGAIN AND THE NEXT I KNEW I WAS ON TOP OF THE BUILDING
5224-35456-0026 SOME ONE HAD AN ARM AROUND ME AND I WAS LEANING CLOSE AGAINST HIM IT CAME TO ME QUITE AS A MATTER OF COURSE THAT THIS WAS ERNEST AND I FOUND MYSELF WONDERING HOW HE HAD GOT HIS HAIR AND EYEBROWS SO BADLY SINGED IT WAS BY THE MEREST CHANCE THAT WE HAD FOUND EACH OTHER IN THAT TERRIBLE CITY
5224-35456-0027 HE HAD HAD NO IDEA THAT I HAD LEFT NEW YORK AND COMING THROUGH THE ROOM WHERE I LAY ASLEEP COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE THAT IT WAS I LITTLE MORE I SAW OF THE CHICAGO COMMUNE AFTER WATCHING THE BALLOON ATTACK ERNEST TOOK ME DOWN INTO THE HEART OF THE BUILDING WHERE I SLEPT THE AFTERNOON OUT AND THE NIGHT
5224-35456-0028 THE THIRD DAY WE SPENT IN THE BUILDING AND ON THE FOURTH ERNEST HAVING GOT PERMISSION AND AN AUTOMOBILE FROM THE AUTHORITIES WE LEFT CHICAGO MY HEADACHE WAS GONE BUT BODY AND SOUL I WAS VERY TIRED I LAY BACK AGAINST ERNEST IN THE AUTOMOBILE
5224-35456-0029 AND WITH APATHETIC EYES WATCHED THE SOLDIERS TRYING TO GET THE MACHINE OUT OF THE CITY FIGHTING WAS STILL GOING ON BUT ONLY IN ISOLATED LOCALITIES HERE AND THERE WHOLE DISTRICTS WERE STILL IN POSSESSION OF THE COMRADES BUT SUCH DISTRICTS WERE SURROUNDED AND GUARDED BY HEAVY BODIES OF TROOPS
5224-35456-0030 IN A HUNDRED SEGREGATED TRAPS WERE THE COMRADES THUS HELD WHILE THE WORK OF SUBJUGATING THEM WENT ON SUBJUGATION MEANT DEATH FOR NO QUARTER WAS GIVEN AND THEY FOUGHT HEROICALLY TO THE LAST MAN NUMBERS
5224-35456-0031 WHILE ONE HELD OUT ELEVEN DAYS EACH BUILDING HAD TO BE STORMED LIKE A FORT AND THE MERCENARIES FOUGHT THEIR WAY UPWARD FLOOR BY FLOOR IT WAS DEADLY FIGHTING QUARTER WAS NEITHER GIVEN NOR TAKEN AND IN THE FIGHTING THE REVOLUTIONISTS HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING ABOVE
5224-35456-0032 WHILE THE REVOLUTIONISTS WERE WIPED OUT THE LOSS WAS NOT ONE SIDED THE PROUD CHICAGO PROLETARIAT LIVED UP TO ITS ANCIENT BOAST FOR AS MANY OF ITSELF AS WERE KILLED IT KILLED THAT MANY OF THE ENEMY
5224-35456-0033 WHENEVER WE APPROACHED SUCH LOCALITIES THE GUARDS TURNED US BACK AND SENT US AROUND ONCE THE ONLY WAY PAST TWO STRONG POSITIONS OF THE COMRADES WAS THROUGH A BURNT SECTION THAT LAY BETWEEN FROM EITHER SIDE WE COULD HEAR THE RATTLE AND ROAR OF WAR
5224-35456-0034 WHILE THE AUTOMOBILE PICKED ITS WAY THROUGH SMOKING RUINS AND TOTTERING WALLS OFTEN THE STREETS WERE BLOCKED BY MOUNTAINS OF DEBRIS THAT COMPELLED US TO GO AROUND WE WERE IN A LABYRINTH OF RUIN AND OUR PROGRESS WAS SLOW THE STOCKYARDS GHETTO PLANT AND EVERYTHING
5224-35456-0035 WERE SMOULDERING RUINS FAR OFF TO THE RIGHT A WIDE SMOKE HAZE DIMMED THE SKY THE TOWN OF PULLMAN THE SOLDIER CHAUFFEUR TOLD US OR WHAT HAD BEEN THE TOWN OF PULLMAN FOR IT WAS UTTERLY DESTROYED HE HAD DRIVEN THE MACHINE OUT THERE WITH DESPATCHES ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE THIRD DAY
5224-35456-0036 SOME OF THE HEAVIEST FIGHTING HAD OCCURRED THERE HE SAID MANY OF THE STREETS BEING RENDERED IMPASSABLE BY THE HEAPS OF THE DEAD SWINGING AROUND THE SHATTERED WALLS OF A BUILDING IN THE STOCKYARDS DISTRICT THE AUTOMOBILE WAS STOPPED BY A WAVE OF DEAD IT WAS FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A WAVE TOSSED UP BY THE SEA
5224-35456-0037 IT WAS PATENT TO US WHAT HAD HAPPENED AS THE MOB CHARGED PAST THE CORNER IT HAD BEEN SWEPT AT RIGHT ANGLES AND POINT BLANK RANGE BY THE MACHINE GUNS DRAWN UP ON THE CROSS STREET BUT DISASTER HAD COME TO THE SOLDIERS A CHANCE BOMB MUST HAVE EXPLODED AMONG THEM FOR THE MOB
5224-35456-0038 CHECKED UNTIL ITS DEAD AND DYING FORMED THE WAVE HAD WHITE CAPPED AND FLUNG FORWARD ITS FOAM OF LIVING FIGHTING SLAVES SOLDIERS AND SLAVES LAY TOGETHER TORN AND MANGLED AROUND AND OVER THE WRECKAGE OF THE AUTOMOBILES AND GUNS ERNEST SPRANG OUT
5224-35456-0039 A FAMILIAR PAIR OF SHOULDERS IN A COTTON SHIRT AND A FAMILIAR FRINGE OF WHITE HAIR HAD CAUGHT HIS EYE I DID NOT WATCH HIM AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE WAS BACK BESIDE ME AND WE WERE SPEEDING ON THAT HE SAID IT WAS BISHOP MOREHOUSE
5224-35456-0040 SOON WE WERE IN THE GREEN COUNTRY AND I TOOK ONE LAST GLANCE BACK AT THE SMOKE FILLED SKY
5224-35456-0041 FOR THE CAUSE THAT WAS LOST ERNEST'S ARM ABOUT ME WAS ELOQUENT WITH LOVE FOR THIS TIME LOST DEAR HEART HE SAID BUT NOT FOREVER WE HAVE LEARNED TO MORROW THE CAUSE WILL RISE AGAIN
5224-35456-0042 STRONG WITH WISDOM AND DISCIPLINE THE AUTOMOBILE DREW UP AT A RAILROAD STATION
5224-35456-0043 AS WE WAITED ON THE PLATFORM THREE TRAINS THUNDERED PAST BOUND WEST TO CHICAGO THEY WERE CROWDED WITH RAGGED UNSKILLED LABORERS PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS SLAVE LEVIES FOR THE REBUILDING OF CHICAGO ERNEST SAID
