8576-300229-0000 OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES SPAIN HAD DECLARED THE PACIFIC A CLOSED SEA TO THE REST OF THE WORLD BUT IN FIFTEEN SIXTY SEVEN IT HAPPENED THAT SIR JOHN HAWKINS AN ENGLISH MARINER WAS CRUISING IN THE GULF OF MEXICO WHEN A TERRIFIC SQUALL AS HE SAID
8576-300229-0001 DROVE HIS SHIPS LANDWARD TO VERA CRUZ AND HE SENT A MESSENGER TO THE SPANISH VICEROY THERE ASKING PERMISSION TO DOCK AND REPAIR HIS BATTERED VESSELS NOW ON ONE OF THE ENGLISH SHIPS WAS A YOUNG OFFICER NOT YET TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE NAMED FRANCIS DRAKE
8576-300229-0002 TWELVE SPANISH MERCHANTMEN RIGGED AS FRIGATES LAY IN THE HARBOUR AND DRAKE OBSERVED THAT CARGO OF SMALL BULK BUT PONDEROUS WEIGHT AND EVIDENTLY PRECIOUS WAS BEING STOWED IN THEIR CAPACIOUS HOLDS
8576-300229-0003 WHENCE DID IT COME COULD ENGLISH PRIVATEERS INTERCEPT IT ON THE HIGH SEAS PERHAPS THE ENGLISH ADVENTURERS EVINCED TOO GREAT INTEREST IN THAT PRECIOUS CARGO FOR THOUGH THE SPANISH GOVERNOR HAD GRANTED THEM PERMISSION TO REPAIR THEIR SHIPS THE ENGLISH HAD BARELY DISMANTLED
8576-300229-0004 WHEN SPANISH FIRE SHIPS CAME DRIFTING DOWN ON THEIR MOORINGS A CANNON SHOT KNOCKED A MUG OF BEER FROM HAWKINS'S HAND AND HEAD OVER HEELS HE FELL INTO THE SEA WHILE A THOUSAND SPANIARDS BEGAN SABRING THE ENGLISH CREW ASHORE
8576-300229-0005 SOME FRIENDLY HAND THREW OUT A ROPE TO HAWKINS WHO WAS CLAD IN COMPLETE ARMOUR IN THE DARK UNSEEN BY THE ENEMY HE PULLED HIMSELF UP THE SIDE OF A SMALLER SHIP AND CUTTING HAWSERS SCUDDED FOR THE OPEN SEA
8576-300229-0006 THERE ESCAPED ALSO OF HAWKINS'S FLEET ANOTHER SMALL SHIP WHICH WAS COMMANDED BY FRANCIS DRAKE AND AFTER MUCH SUFFERING BOTH VESSELS REACHED ENGLAND ONE CAN IMAGINE THE EFFECT ON YOUNG DRAKE OF THE TREACHEROUS ACT AND OF THE GLIMPSE OF THAT CARGO OF GOLD AND SILVER TREASURE
8576-300229-0007 HE WOULD MEET THE RAID WITH COUNTER RAID THREE YEARS LATER HE WAS CRUISING THE SPANISH MAIN CAPTURING AND PLUNDERING SHIPS AND FORTS AND TOWNS
8576-300229-0008 IN FIFTEEN SEVENTY TWO HE LED HIS MEN ACROSS THE ISTHMUS OF PANAMA AND INTERCEPTED AND CAPTURED A SPANISH CONVOY OF TREASURE COMING OVERLAND NEAR THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE ISTHMUS HE CLIMBED A TREE AND HAD HIS FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE PACIFIC IT SET HIS BLOOD ON THE LEAP
8576-300229-0009 ON BENDED KNEE HE PRAYED ALOUD TO THE ALMIGHTY TO BE PERMITTED TO SAIL THE FIRST ENGLISH SHIP ON THAT FAIRE SEA AND HAVING RECROSSED THE ISTHMUS AND LOADED HIS SHIPS WITH PLUNDER HE BORE AWAY FOR ENGLAND AND REACHED PLYMOUTH IN AUGUST FIFTEEN SEVENTY THREE
8576-300229-0010 THE RAID ON PANAMA HAD BROUGHT DRAKE ENORMOUS WEALTH AT HIS OWN COST HE BUILT THREE FRIGATES AND TWO SLOOPS TO EXPLORE THE SOUTH SEAS HIS PURPOSE BEING TO ENTER THE PACIFIC THROUGH THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN WHICH NO ENGLISHMAN HAD YET VENTURED TO PASS
8576-300229-0011 THESE SHIPS HE EQUIPPED AS IF FOR ROYAL TOURNAMENT PLAYERS OF THE VIOLIN AND THE HARP DISCOURSED MUSIC AT EACH MEAL RAREST WINES FILLED THE LOCKERS
8576-300229-0012 WHO NEVER SAT OR DONNED HAT IN HIS PRESENCE AND ON HIS OWN SHIP THE PELICAN AFTERWARDS CALLED THE GOLDEN HIND HE HAD A HUNDRED PICKED MARINES MEN EAGER FOR BATTLE AND SKILFUL IN WIELDING THE CUTLASS
8576-300229-0013 HIS MEN LOVED HIM AS A DAUNTLESS LEADER THEY FEARED HIM TOO WITH A FEAR THAT COMMANDED OBEDIENCE ON THE INSTANT QUEEN ELIZABETH WAS IN A QUANDARY HOW TO TREAT HER GALLANT BUCCANEER AND ROVER OF THE HIGH SEAS
8576-300229-0014 ENGLAND AND SPAIN WERE AT PEACE AND SHE COULD NOT GIVE DRAKE AN OPEN ROYAL COMMISSION TO RAID THE COMMERCE OF A FRIENDLY POWER BUT SHE DID PRESENT HIM WITH A MAGNIFICENT SWORD TO SIGNIFY THAT SHE WOULD HAVE NO OBJECTION IF HE SHOULD CUT HIS WAY THROUGH THE PORTALS LEADING TO THE CLOSED SEA
8576-300229-0015 THE FLEET SET SAIL IN DECEMBER FIFTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND STEERED BY THE WEST COAST OF MOROCCO AND THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS THE COAST OF BRAZIL WAS REACHED IN APRIL TWO OF THE SHIPS WERE ABANDONED NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE RIO DE LA PLATA
8576-300229-0016 AFTER HAVING BEEN STRIPPED OF PROVISIONS IN AUGUST THE REMAINING THREE SHIPS ENTERED THE TEMPESTUOUS SEAS AROUND CAPE HORN DRAKE DROVE BEFORE THE GALES WITH SAILS CLOSE REEFED AND HATCHES BATTENED
8576-300229-0017 THE FIRST ENGLISH KEEL TO CLEAVE THE WATERS OF THE PACIFIC IN HONOUR OF THE FEAT DRAKE RENAMED HIS SHIP THE GOLDEN HIND
8576-300229-0018 CERTAIN IT IS THE CREW OF THE GOLDEN HIND WERE WELL CONTENT WITH THE POSSESSION OF BOTH GOLD AND SPEED BEFORE ADVANCING FAR UP THE WEST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA QUITE BY CHANCE WHICH SEEMS ALWAYS TO FAVOUR THE DARING
8576-300229-0019 SOMEWHERE OFF THE COAST OF CHILE DRAKE PICKED UP AN INDIAN FISHERMAN THE NATIVES OF SOUTH AMERICA FOR THE BEST OF REASONS HATED THEIR SPANISH MASTERS WHO ENSLAVED THEM TREATED THEM BRUTALLY AND FORCED THEM TO WORK IN THE PEARL FISHERIES AND THE MINES
8576-300229-0020 NEVER DREAMING THAT ANY FOREIGN VESSEL HAD ENTERED THE PACIFIC SPANISH TREASURE SHIPS LAY ROCKING TO THE TIDE IN FANCIED SECURITY AND ACTUALLY DIPPED COLOURS TO DRAKE DRAKE LAUGHED WAVED HIS PLUMED HAT BACK IN SALUTE
8576-300229-0021 DEALT OUT WINE TO GIVE COURAGE TO HIS MERRIE BOYS AND SAILED STRAIGHT AMID THE ANCHORED TREASURE SHIPS BARELY HAD THE GOLDEN HIND TAKEN A POSITION IN THE MIDST OF THE ENEMY'S FLEET
8576-300229-0022 DRAKE HAD GRAPPLING IRONS THROWN OUT CLAMPING HIS SHIP TO HER VICTIM IN A TRICE THE ENGLISH SAILORS WERE ON THE SPANISH DECK WITH SWORDS OUT AND THE RALLYING CRY OF GOD AND SAINT GEORGE DOWN WITH SPANISH DOGS
8576-300229-0023 DUMBFOUNDED AND UNARMED DOWN THE HATCHES OVER THE BULWARKS INTO THE SEA REELED THE SURPRISED SPANIARDS DRAKE CLAPPED HATCHES DOWN UPON THOSE TRAPPED INSIDE AND TURNED HIS CANNON ON THE REST OF THE UNGUARDED SPANISH FLEET LITERALLY NOT A DROP OF BLOOD WAS SHED
8576-300229-0024 THE TREASURE SHIPS WERE LOOTED OF THEIR CARGOES AND SENT DRIFTING OUT TO SEA ALL THE OTHER HARBOURS OF THE PACIFIC WERE RAIDED AND LOOTED IN SIMILAR SUMMARY FASHION AND SOMEWHERE SEAWARD FROM LIMA DRAKE LEARNED OF A TREASURE SHIP BEARING UNTOLD RICHES
8576-300229-0025 THE GLORY OF THE SOUTH SEAS THE HUGE CARAVEL IN WHICH THE SPANIARDS SENT HOME TO SPAIN THE YEARLY TRIBUTE OF BULLION THE GOLDEN HIND WITH HER SAILS SPREAD TO THE WIND SOUGHT FOR THE GLORY LIKE A HARRIER FOR ITS QUARRY
8576-300229-0026 ONE CREW OF SPANIARDS ON A SMALL SHIP THAT WAS SCUTTLED SAVED THEIR THROATS BY TELLING DRAKE THAT THE GREAT SHIP WAS ONLY TWO DAYS AHEAD AND LOADED TO THE WATER LINE WITH WEALTH UNTOLD
8576-300229-0027 AND CALLED ON HIS CREW TO QUIT THEMSELVES LIKE MEN AND WHEN THE WIND WENT DOWN HE ORDERED SMALL BOATS OUT TO TOW THE GOLDEN HIND FOR FIVE DAYS THE HUNT LASTED NEVER SLACKENING BY DAY OR BY NIGHT AND WHEN AT THREE IN THE AFTERNOON OF A DAY IN MARCH
8576-300229-0028 DRAKE'S BROTHER SHOUTED FROM THE CROSS TREES SAIL HO EVERY MAN ABOARD WENT MAD WITH IMPATIENCE TO CROWD ON THE LAST INCH OF CANVAS AND OVERTAKE THE RICH PRIZE THE ENGLISHMEN SAW THAT THE SPANISH SHIP WAS SO HEAVILY LADEN THAT SHE WAS MAKING BUT SLOW PROGRESS
8576-300229-0029 AND SO UNCONSCIOUS WAS THE SPANISH CAPTAIN OF DANGER THAT WHEN HE DISCERNED A SHIP APPROACHING HE ACTUALLY LOWERED CANVAS AND AWAITED WHAT HE THOUGHT MIGHT BE FRESH ORDERS FROM THE VICEROY THE GOLDEN HIND SPED ON TILL SHE WAS ALMOST ALONGSIDE THE SPANIARD
8576-300229-0030 THEN DRAKE LET GO FULL BLAST ALL THIRTY CANNON AS FAST AS HE COULD SHIFT AND VEER FOR THE CANNONEERS TO TAKE AIM YARDS SAILS MASTS FELL SHATTERED AND TORN FROM THE SPLENDID SPANISH SHIP
8576-300229-0031 THE ENGLISH CLAPPED THEIR GRAPPLING HOOKS TO HER SIDES AND NAKED SWORDS DID THE REST TO SAVE THEIR LIVES THE SPANISH CREW AFTER A FEEBLE RESISTANCE
8576-300229-0032 DRAKE'S VESSEL WAS NOW LOADED DEEP WITH TREASURE AND PREPARATIONS WERE MADE TO SAIL HOMEWARD
8576-300229-0033 IT WAS THEN THAT LEGENDS OF A NORTH EAST PASSAGE CAME INTO HIS MIND HE WOULD SAIL NORTHWARD IN SEARCH OF THE STRAIT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAD THROUGH THE CONTINENT TO THE ATLANTIC THE MYTHICAL STRAIT OF ANIAN AS THE WORLD KNOWS THERE WAS NO SUCH PASSAGE
8576-300229-0034 BUT HOW FAR NORTH DID DRAKE SAIL SEEKING IT SOME ACCOUNTS SAY AS FAR AS OREGON OTHERS AS FAR AS THE NORTHERN COAST OF CALIFORNIA BUT AT ALL EVENTS AS HE ADVANCED FARTHER NORTH HE FOUND THAT THE COAST SHEERED FARTHER AND FARTHER WEST
8576-300229-0035 SO HE GAVE OVER HIS ATTEMPT TO FIND THE STRAIT OF THE LEGENDS AND TURNED BACK AND ANCHORED IN A FAIRE AND GOOD BAY WHICH IS NOW KNOWN AS DRAKE'S BAY A SHORT DISTANCE NORTH OF SAN FRANCISCO AND NAMING THE REGION NEW ALBION HE CLAIMED IT FOR QUEEN ELIZABETH
8576-300229-0036 IN JULY FIFTEEN SEVENTY NINE
8576-300229-0037 IN JUNE HE ROUNDED THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE AND THEN BEAT HIS WAY UP THE ATLANTIC TO ENGLAND IN SEPTEMBER FIFTEEN EIGHTY THE GOLDEN HIND ENTERED THE HARBOUR OF PLYMOUTH HOW DRAKE BECAME THE LION OF THE HOUR WHEN HE REACHED ENGLAND
8576-300229-0038 AFTER HAVING CIRCUMNAVIGATED THE GLOBE NEED NOT BE TOLD BALLADS WERE RECITED IN HIS HONOUR QUEEN ELIZABETH DINED IN STATE ON THE GOLDEN HIND AND AFTER THE DINNER WITH THE SWORD WHICH SHE HAD GIVEN HIM WHEN HE SET OUT SHE CONFERRED ON DRAKE THE HONOUR OF KNIGHTHOOD
8576-300229-0039 AS THE SEAL OF HIS COUNTRY'S ACCLAIM DRAKE'S CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THE SUPPOSED PASSAGE FROM THE PACIFIC TO THE ATLANTIC WERE CORRECT THOUGH FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS THEY WERE REJECTED BY GEOGRAPHERS HIS WORDS ARE WORTH SETTING DOWN
8576-300229-0040 THE ASIAN AND AMERICAN CONTINENTS IF THEY BE NOT FULLY JOINED
8576-300229-0041 THE SNOW HARDLY DEPARTETH FROM THESE HILLS AT ALL
