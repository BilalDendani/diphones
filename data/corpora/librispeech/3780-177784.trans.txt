3780-177784-0000 WHEN ESTHER ENTERED MISS MARY HAD GIVEN HER A WHITE MUSLIN DRESS A SQUARE CUT BODICE WITH SLEEVES REACHING TO THE ELBOWS AND A BLUE SASH TIED ROUND THE WAIST THE REMARKS AS SHE PASSED WERE A NICE PRETTY GIRL
3780-177784-0001 WILLIAM WAS WAITING AND SHE WENT AWAY WITH HIM ON THE HOP OF A VIGOROUS POLKA MANY OF THE DANCERS HAD GONE TO GET COOL IN THE GARDENS BUT A FEW COUPLES HAD BEGUN TO WHIRL THE WOMEN BORNE ALONG BY FORCE
3780-177784-0002 THE MEN POISING THEIR LEGS INTO CURIOUS GEOMETRICAL POSITIONS MISTER LEOPOLD WAS VERY BUSY DRAGGING MEN AWAY FROM THE CIRCULAR BUFFET THEY MUST DANCE WHETHER THEY KNEW HOW OR NOT
3780-177784-0003 THE GAFFER HAS TOLD ME PARTIC'LAR TO SEE THAT THE GALS ALL HAD PARTNERS AND JUST LOOK DOWN THAT ERE ROOM ALF OF THAT LOT AVEN'T BEEN ON THEIR LEGS YET ERE'S A PARTNER FOR YOU AND THE BUTLER PULLED A YOUNG GAMEKEEPER TOWARDS A YOUNG GIRL
3780-177784-0004 AND THE STRANGENESS OF THE SPECTACLE CAUSED MISTER LEOPOLD TO PAUSE IT WAS WHISPERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER WORN A LOW DRESS BEFORE AND GROVER CAME TO THE RESCUE OF HER MODESTY WITH A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF BUT IT HAD BEEN FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO RESTRICT THE BALL
3780-177784-0005 TO THOSE WHO POSSESSED OR COULD OBTAIN AN EVENING SUIT AND PLENTY OF CHECK TROUSERS AND RED NECKTIES WERE HOPPING ABOUT AMONG THE VILLAGERS MANY A TOUCH SUGGESTED COSTUME
3780-177784-0006 AND A YOUNG MAN WORE A CANARY COLOURED WAISTCOAT AND A BLUE COASTGUARDSMAN'S COAT OF OLD TIME THESE TOUCHES OF FANCY AND PERSONAL TASTE DIVIDED THE VILLAGERS FROM THE HOUSEHOLD SERVANTS THE BUTLERS SEEMED ON THE WATCH FOR SIDE DISHES
3780-177784-0007 AND THE VALETS SUGGESTED HAIR BRUSHES AND HOT WATER COOKS TRAILED BLACK SILK DRESSES ADORNED WITH WIDE COLLARS AND FASTENED WITH GOLD BROOCHES CONTAINING PORTRAITS OF THEIR LATE HUSBANDS
3780-177784-0008 THE LAVENDER GLOVED HANDS THE DELICATE FACES EXPRESSIVE OF EASE AND LEISURE MADE GINGER'S TWO FRIENDS
3780-177784-0009 NOTICEABLE AMONG THIS MENIAL WORK A DAY CROWD GINGER LOVED THE UPPER CIRCLES AND NOW HE ROMPED THE POLKA IN THE MOST APPROVED LONDON FASHION HIS ELBOWS ADVANCED LIKE A YACHT'S BOWSPRIT AND HIS COAT TAILS FLYING
3780-177784-0010 SHE HAD DANCED WITH YOUNG MISTER PRESTON AND SEEING HER SITTING ALONE GROVER CALLED HER AND ASKED HER WHY SHE WAS NOT DANCING
3780-177784-0011 COME THE NEXT POLKA
3780-177784-0012 HALF A DOZEN TIMES WILLIAM REPEATED HIS DEMAND AT LAST SHE SAID YOU'VE SPOILT ALL MY PLEASURE IN THE DANCING I'M SORRY IF I'VE DONE THAT ESTHER I WAS JEALOUS THAT'S ALL JEALOUS
3780-177784-0013 WHAT WAS YOU JEALOUS FOR WHAT DO IT MATTER WHAT PEOPLE THINK SO LONG AS I KNOW I HAVEN'T DONE NO WRONG AND IN SILENCE THEY WALKED INTO THE GARDEN THE NIGHT WAS WARM EVEN OPPRESSIVE AND THE MOON HUNG LIKE A BALLOON ABOVE THE TREES
3780-177784-0014 AND OFTEN THE STRAYING REVELLERS STOPPED TO CONSIDER THE MARKINGS NOW SO PLAIN UPON ITS DISC THERE WERE ARBOURS ARTIFICIAL RUINS DARKLING PATHWAYS AND THE BREATHLESS GARDEN WAS NOISY IN THE ILLUSIVE LIGHT
3780-177784-0015 WILLIAM SHOWED ESTHER THE THEATRE AND EXPLAINED ITS PURPOSE SHE LISTENED THOUGH SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND NOR COULD SHE BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS NOT DREAMING WHEN THEY SUDDENLY STOOD ON THE BORDERS OF A BEAUTIFUL LAKE FULL OF THE SHADOWS OF TALL TREES
3780-177784-0016 HOW STILL THE WATER IS AND THE STARS THEY ARE LOVELY YOU SHOULD SEE THE GARDENS ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS WHEN THE EXCURSION COMES IN FROM BRIGHTON THEY WALKED ON A LITTLE FURTHER AND ESTHER SAID
3780-177784-0017 WHAT'S THESE PLACES AIN'T THEY DARK THESE ARE ARBOURS WHERE WE AS SHRIMPS AND TEA I'LL TAKE YOU NEXT SATURDAY IF YOU'LL COME A NOISY BAND OF YOUNG MEN FOLLOWED BY THREE OR FOUR GIRLS RAN ACROSS THE BRIDGE
3780-177784-0018 SOME CHOSE THE LEFT SOME THE RIGHT THOSE WHO WENT TO THE RIGHT SENT UP A YELL OF TRIUMPH AND PADDLED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE WATER THEY FIRST ADDRESSED REMARKS TO THEIR COMPANIONS AND THEN THEY ADMIRED THE MOON AND STARS
3780-177784-0019 A SONG WAS DEMANDED AND AT THE END OF THE SECOND VERSE WILLIAM THREW HIS ARM ROUND ESTHER OH ESTHER I DO LOVE YOU SHE LOOKED AT HIM HER GREY EYES FIXED IN A LONG INTERROGATION
3780-177784-0020 WHAT IS THERE TO LOVE IN ME HE SQUEEZED HER TIGHTLY AND CONTINUED HIS PROTESTATIONS I DO I DO I DO LOVE YOU ESTHER SHE DID NOT ANSWER AND THEY WALKED SLOWLY ON
3780-177784-0021 A HOLLY BUSH THREW A BLACK SHADOW ON THE GRAVEL PATH AND A MOMENT AFTER THE ORNAMENTAL TIN ROOF OF THE DANCING ROOM APPEARED BETWEEN THE TREES EVEN IN THEIR SHORT ABSENCE A CHANGE HAD COME UPON THE BALL ABOUT THE CIRCULAR BUFFET
3780-177784-0022 NUMBERS OF MEN CALLED FOR DRINK AND TALKED LOUDLY OF HORSE RACING MANY WERE AWAY AT SUPPER AND THOSE THAT REMAINED WERE AMUSING THEMSELVES IN A DESULTORY FASHION A TALL LEAN WOMAN DRESSED LIKE SARAH IN WHITE MUSLIN WEARING AMBER BEADS ROUND HER NECK
3780-177784-0023 WAS DANCING THE LANCERS WITH THE DEMON AND EVERYONE SHOOK WITH LAUGHTER WHEN SHE WHIRLED THE LITTLE FELLOW ROUND OR TOOK HIM IN HER ARMS AND CARRIED HIM ACROSS WILLIAM WANTED TO DANCE BUT ESTHER WAS HUNGRY AND LED HIM AWAY TO AN ADJOINING BUILDING
3780-177784-0024 CHICKEN AND BEER MIGHT BE HAD BY THE STRONG AND ADVENTUROUS AS THEY STRUGGLED THROUGH THE CROWD
3780-177784-0025 NOW TELL ME IF THEY ASK ME THE YOUNG GENTS YONDER TO DANCE AM I TO LOOK THEM STRAIGHT IN THE FACE AND SAY NO WILLIAM CONSIDERED A MOMENT AND THEN HE SAID
3780-177784-0026 I THINK YOU HAD BETTER DANCE WITH THEM IF THEY ASKS YOU IF YOU REFUSE SARAH WILL SAY IT WAS I WHO PUT YOU UP TO IT LET'S HAVE ANOTHER BOTTLE CRIED GINGER COME
3780-177784-0027 MISTER THOMAS COUGHED SMILED AND SAID THAT MISTER ARTHUR WISHED TO SEE HIM IN THE HANDS OF THE POLICE HOWEVER HE PROMISED TO DRINK HIS SHARE TWO MORE BOTTLES WERE SENT FOR AND STIMULATED BY THE WINE
3780-177784-0028 THE WEIGHTS THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE ASSIGNED TO CERTAIN HORSES IN THE AUTUMN HANDICAP WERE DISCUSSED WILLIAM WAS VERY PROUD OF BEING ADMITTED INTO SUCH COMPANY
3780-177784-0029 A CIGAR WHICH HE DID NOT LIKE BETWEEN HIS TEETH AND A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE IN HIS HAND SUDDENLY THE CONVERSATION WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE CORNET SOUNDING THE FIRST PHRASE OF A FAVOURITE WALTZ AND THE TIPSY AND THE SOBER HASTENED AWAY
3780-177784-0030 NEITHER ESTHER NOR WILLIAM KNEW HOW TO WALTZ BUT THEY TUMBLED ROUND THE ROOM ENJOYING THEMSELVES IMMENSELY IN THE POLKA AND MAZURKA THEY GOT ON BETTER
3780-177784-0031 AND ALL WERE GAY AND PLEASANT EVEN SARAH'S USUALLY SOUR FACE GLOWED WITH CORDIALITY WHEN THEY JOINED HANDS AND RACED ROUND THE MEN STANDING IN THE MIDDLE IN THE CHAIN THEY LOST THEMSELVES AS IN A LABYRINTH
3780-177784-0032 AND FOUND THEIR PARTNERS UNEXPECTEDLY BUT THE DANCE OF THE EVENING WAS SIR ROGER DE COVERLEY AND ESTHER'S USUALLY SOBER LITTLE BRAIN EVAPORATED IN THE FOLLY OF RUNNING UP THE ROOM THEN TURNING AND RUNNING BACKWARDS
3780-177784-0033 GETTING INTO HER PLACE AS BEST SHE COULD AND THEN STARTING AGAIN IT ALWAYS APPEARED TO BE HER TURN AND IT WAS SO SWEET TO SEE HER DEAR WILLIAM AND SUCH A STRANGE EXCITEMENT TO RUN FORWARD TO MEET YOUNG MISTER PRESTON TO CURTSEY TO HIM AND THEN RUN AWAY
3780-177784-0034 THERE'S THE DAWN ESTHER LOOKED AND IN THE WHITENING DOORWAYS SHE SAW THE LITTLE JOCKEY STAGGERING ABOUT HELPLESSLY DRUNK THE SMILE DIED OUT OF HER EYES SHE RETURNED TO HER TRUE SELF TO MISSUS BARFIELD AND THE BRETHREN
3780-177784-0035 SHE FELT THAT ALL THIS DANCING DRINKING AND KISSING IN THE ARBOURS WAS WICKED BUT MISS MARY HAD SENT FOR HER AND HAD TOLD HER THAT SHE WOULD GIVE HER ONE OF HER DRESSES
3780-177784-0036 THEN IF SHE HAD NOT GONE WILLIAM
3780-177784-0037 ESTHER RAN OUT TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND THERE SHE WITNESSED A DISGRACEFUL SCENE THE LEAN WOMAN IN THE MUSLIN DRESS AND THE AMBER BEADS ACCUSED YOUNG MISTER PRESTON OF SOMETHING WHICH HE DENIED AND SHE HEARD WILLIAM TELL SOMEONE THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN
3780-177784-0038 DIDN'T WANT NO ROWING AT THIS ERE BALL AND WHAT WAS MORE THEY DIDN'T MEAN TO HAVE NONE AND HER HEART FILLED WITH LOVE FOR HER BIG WILLIAM WHAT A FINE FELLOW HE WAS HOW HANDSOME WERE HIS SHOULDERS BESIDE THAT ROUND SHOULDERED LITTLE MAN
3780-177784-0039 WHOM HE SO EASILY PULLED ASIDE AND HAVING CRUSHED OUT THE QUARREL HE HELPED HER ON WITH HER JACKET AND HANGING ON HIS ARM
3780-177784-0040 SARAH WAS WITH HER FAITHFUL ADMIRER A MAN WITH A RED BEARD WHOM SHE HAD PICKED UP AT THE BALL GROVER WADDLED IN THE REAR EMBARRASSED WITH THE GREEN SILK WHICH SHE HELD HIGH OUT OF THE DUST OF THE ROAD WHEN THEY REACHED THE STATION
3780-177784-0041 THE SKY WAS STAINED WITH ROSE AND THE BARREN DOWNS MORE TIN LIKE THAN EVER IN THE SHADOW LESS LIGHT OF DAWN STRETCHED ACROSS THE SUNRISE FROM LANCING TO BRIGHTON THE LITTLE BIRDS SAT RUFFLING THEIR FEATHERS AND AWAKING TO THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DAY
3780-177784-0042 THE NIGHT HAD BEEN CLOSE AND SULTRY AND EVEN AT THIS HOUR THERE WAS HARDLY ANY FRESHNESS IN THE AIR ESTHER LOOKED AT THE HILLS EXAMINING THE LANDSCAPE INTENTLY SHE WAS THINKING OF THE FIRST TIME SHE SAW IT
3780-177784-0043 SOME VAGUE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS THE LIKENESS THAT THE MORNING LANDSCAPE BORE TO THE EVENING LANDSCAPE OR THE WISH TO PROLONG THE SWEETNESS OF THESE THE LAST MOMENTS OF HER HAPPINESS IMPELLED HER TO LINGER
3780-177784-0044 WERE NOT BEAUTIFUL THE TOO FAMILIAR LANDSCAPE AWOKE IN WILLIAM NEITHER IDEA NOR SENSATION ESTHER INTERESTED HIM MORE AND WHILE SHE GAZED DREAMILY ON THE HILLS
3780-177784-0045 WHICH SHOWED BENEATH THE UNBUTTONED JACKET
