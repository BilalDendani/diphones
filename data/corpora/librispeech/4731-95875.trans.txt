4731-95875-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN LEGISLATING WOMAN'S MORALS
4731-95875-0001 IS THE CHANGING OF OUR SO CALLED OBSCENITY LAWS THIS WILL BE NO EASY UNDERTAKING IT IS USUALLY MUCH EASIER TO ENACT STATUTES THAN TO REVISE THEM LAWS ARE SELDOM EXACTLY WHAT THEY SEEM RARELY WHAT THEIR ADVOCATES CLAIM FOR THEM
4731-95875-0002 THE OBSCENITY STATUTES ARE PARTICULARLY DECEPTIVE ENACTED
4731-95875-0003 THEY MAKE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE SCIENTIFIC WORKS OF HUMAN EMANCIPATORS LIKE FOREL AND ELLIS AND PRINTED MATTER SUCH AS THEY ARE OSTENSIBLY AIMED AT NATURALLY ENOUGH THEN DETECTIVES AND NARROW MINDED JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS WHO WOULD CHUCKLE OVER PICTURES THAT WOULD MAKE A CLEAN MINDED WOMAN SHUDDER
4731-95875-0004 IN THE BIRTH CONTROL MOVEMENT SHE HAS ALREADY BEGUN TO FIGHT FOR HER RIGHT TO HAVE WITHOUT LEGAL INTERFERENCE ALL KNOWLEDGE PERTAINING TO HER SEX NATURE THIS IS THE THIRD AND MOST IMPORTANT OF THE EPOCH MAKING BATTLES FOR GENERAL LIBERTY UPON AMERICAN SOIL
4731-95875-0005 IT IS MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS TO PURIFY THE VERY FOUNTAIN OF THE RACE AND MAKE THE RACE COMPLETELY FREE THE FIRST AND MOST DRAMATIC OF THE THREE GREAT STRUGGLES FOR LIBERTY
4731-95875-0006 IT HAD FOR ITS OBJECT THE RIGHT TO HOLD SUCH POLITICAL BELIEFS AS ONE MIGHT CHOOSE AND TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THOSE BELIEFS IF THIS POLITICAL FREEDOM IS NOW LOST TO US IT IS BECAUSE WE DID NOT HOLD STRONGLY ENOUGH TO THOSE LIBERTIES FOUGHT FOR BY OUR FOREFATHERS
4731-95875-0007 HIS CHAMPIONSHIP OF THE MUCH VAUNTED AND LITTLE EXERCISED FREEDOM OF RELIGIOUS OPINION
4731-95875-0008 AND THEN THE EFFORT TO ENFORCE THEM IS RIDICULOUS WITHIN A FEW YEARS THE TRAGIC COMBINATION OF FALSE MORAL STANDARDS AND INFAMOUS OBSCENITY LAWS WILL BE AS RIDICULOUS IN THE PUBLIC MIND AS ARE THE NOW ALL BUT FORGOTTEN BLASPHEMY LAWS IF THE OBSCENITY LAWS ARE NOT RADICALLY REVISED OR REPEALED
4731-95875-0009 FEW REACTIONARIES WILL DARE TO FACE THE PUBLIC DERISION THAT WILL GREET THEIR ATTEMPTS TO USE THEM TO STAY WOMAN'S PROGRESS THE FRENCH HAVE A SAYING CONCERNING MORT MAIN THE DEAD HAND THIS HAND OF THE PAST REACHES UP INTO THE PRESENT TO SMOTHER THE RISING FLAME OF MODERN IDEALS
4731-95875-0010 TO REFORGE OUR CHAINS WHEN WE HAVE BROKEN THEM TO ARREST PROGRESS IT IS THE HAND OF SUCH AS HAVE LIVED ON EARTH BUT HAVE NOT LOVED HUMANITY AT THE CALL OF THOSE WHO FEAR PROGRESS AND FREEDOM IT RISES FROM THE GLOOM OF FORGOTTEN THINGS TO OPPRESS THE LIVING
4731-95875-0011 IT IS THE DEAD HAND THAT HOLDS IMPRISONED WITHIN THE OBSCENITY LAWS ALL DIRECT INFORMATION CONCERNING BIRTH CONTROL IT IS THE DEAD HAND THAT THUS COMPELS MILLIONS OF AMERICAN WOMEN TO REMAIN IN THE BONDAGE OF MATERNITY PREVIOUS TO THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT
4731-95875-0012 OF INFORMATION CONCERNING CONTRACEPTIVES IN THAT YEAR HOWEVER THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF NEW YORK PASSED AN ACT WHICH SPECIFICALLY INCLUDED THE SUBJECT OF CONTRACEPTIVES
4731-95875-0013 THE ACT MADE IT EXACTLY AS GREAT AN OFFENSE TO GIVE SUCH INFORMATION AS TO EXHIBIT THE SORT OF PICTURES AND WRITINGS AT WHICH THE LEGISLATION WAS OSTENSIBLY AIMED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE THE LATE ANTHONY COMSTOCK
4731-95875-0014 WHO WITH A LIST OF CONTRIBUTORS MOST OF WHOM DID NOT REALIZE THE REAL EFFECTS OF HIS WORK
4731-95875-0015 SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING THE PASSAGE OF THE FEDERAL OBSCENITY ACT THIS ACT WAS PRESENTED AS ONE TO PREVENT THE CIRCULATION OF PORNOGRAPHIC LITERATURE AND PICTURES AMONG SCHOOL CHILDREN AS SUCH
4731-95875-0016 THIS ACT MADE IT A CRIME TO USE THE MAILS TO CONVEY CONTRACEPTIVES OR INFORMATION CONCERNING CONTRACEPTIVES OTHER ACTS LATER MADE THE ORIGINAL LAW APPLICABLE TO EXPRESS COMPANIES AND OTHER COMMON CARRIERS AS WELL AS TO THE MAILS WITH THIS PRECEDENT ESTABLISHED
4731-95875-0017 A PRECEDENT WHICH A MAJORITY OF THE CONGRESSMEN COULD HARDLY HAVE UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE OF THE HASTY PASSAGE OF THE ACT COMSTOCK SECURED THE ENACTMENT OF STATE LAWS TO THE SAME EFFECT MEANWHILE THE PROVISIONS REGARDING CONTRACEPTIVES HAD BEEN DROPPED FROM THE AMENDED NEW YORK STATE LAW OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO
4731-95875-0018 IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE HOWEVER A NEW SECTION SAID TO HAVE BEEN DRAFTED BY COMSTOCK HIMSELF
4731-95875-0019 AND THAT SECTION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SUBSTANCE OF THE PRESENT LAW NONE OF THESE ACTS MADE IT AN OFFENSE TO PREVENT CONCEPTION ALL OF THEM PROVIDED PUNISHMENT FOR ANYONE DISSEMINATING INFORMATION CONCERNING THE PREVENTION OF CONCEPTION
4731-95875-0020 COMSTOCK HAS PASSED OUT OF PUBLIC NOTICE HIS BODY HAS BEEN ENTOMBED BUT THE EVIL THAT HE DID LIVES AFTER HIM
4731-95875-0021 THOSE LAWS STILL LIVE LEGAL MONUMENTS TO IGNORANCE AND TO OPPRESSION
4731-95875-0022 WHO UNDERGO THE AGONY OF ABORTION EACH YEAR THIS HAND REACHES OUT TO COMPEL THE BIRTH OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INFANTS WHO MUST DIE BEFORE THEY ARE TWELVE MONTHS OLD LIKE MANY LAWS UPON OUR STATUTE BOOKS THESE ARE BEING PERSISTENTLY AND INTELLIGENTLY VIOLATED
4731-95875-0023 HAS NO CHILDREN AT ALL OR A SMALL FAMILY THE FAMILY OF THE JUDGE WHO PASSES UPON THE CASE IS LIKELY TO BE SMALLER STILL THE WORDS IT IS THE LAW SUMS IT ALL UP FOR THESE OFFICIALS WHEN THEY PASS SENTENCE IN COURT
4731-95875-0024 BUT THESE WORDS SO MAGICAL TO THE OFFICIAL MIND HAVE NO WEIGHT WHEN THESE SAME OFFICIALS ARE ADJUSTING THEIR OWN PRIVATE LIVES THEY THEN OBEY THE HIGHER LAWS OF THEIR OWN BEINGS THEY BREAK THE OBSOLETE STATUTES FOR THEMSELVES WHILE ENFORCING THEM FOR OTHERS
4731-95875-0025 THIS IS NOT THE SITUATION WITH THE POORER PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES HOWEVER MILLIONS OF THEM KNOW NOTHING OF RELIABLE CONTRACEPTIVES WHEN WOMEN OF THE IMPOVERISHED STRATA OF SOCIETY DO NOT BREAK THESE LAWS AGAINST CONTRACEPTIVES
4731-95875-0026 OR UPON FAMILY LIMITATION WAS PROSECUTED IF DETECTED
4731-95875-0027 THE DARKNESS THAT SURROUNDED THE WHOLE FIELD OF SEX WAS MADE AS COMPLETE AS POSSIBLE SINCE THEN THE FEELING OF THE AWAKENED WOMEN OF AMERICA HAS INTENSIFIED
4731-95875-0028 THE AROUSING OF PUBLIC CONSCIENCE HAVE ALL OPERATED TO GIVE FORCE AND VOLUME TO THE DEMAND FOR WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CONTROL HER OWN BODY THAT SHE MAY WORK OUT HER OWN SALVATION THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN STRICTLY LEGAL MEASURES AS WELL AS THOSE WHO BELIEVE BOTH IN LEGAL MEASURES
4731-95875-0029 AND IN OPEN DEFIANCE OF THESE BRUTAL AND UNJUST LAWS ARE DEMANDING AMENDMENTS TO THE OBSCENITY STATUTES WHICH SHALL REMOVE INFORMATION CONCERNING CONTRACEPTIVES FROM ITS PRESENT CLASSIFICATION AMONG THINGS FILTHY AND OBSCENE
4731-95875-0030 AN AMENDMENT TYPICAL OF THOSE OFFERED IS THAT DRAWN UP FOR THE NEW YORK STATUTES UNDER THE DIRECTION OF SAMUEL MC CLURE LINDSEY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY
4731-95875-0031 PHYSICIANS INSTRUMENTS AND INFORMATION AN ARTICLE OR INSTRUMENT USED OR APPLIED BY PHYSICIANS LAWFULLY PRACTICING OR BY THEIR DIRECTION OR PRESCRIPTION FOR THE CURE OR PREVENTION OF DISEASE
4731-95875-0032 IS NOT AN ARTICLE OF INDECENT OR IMMORAL NATURE OR USE WITHIN THIS ARTICLE THE SUPPLYING OF SUCH ARTICLES TO SUCH PHYSICIANS OR BY THEIR DIRECTION OR PRESCRIPTION IS NOT AN OFFENSE UNDER THIS ARTICLE
4731-95875-0033 THE GIVING BY A DULY LICENSED PHYSICIAN OR REGISTERED NURSE LAWFULLY PRACTICING OF INFORMATION OR ADVICE IN REGARD TO OR THE SUPPLYING TO ANY PERSON OF ANY ARTICLE OR MEDICINE FOR THE PREVENTION OF CONCEPTION
4731-95875-0034 IS NOT A VIOLATION OF ANY PROVISION OF THIS ARTICLE THIS PROPOSED AMENDMENT SHOULD WITHOUT DOUBT INCLUDE MIDWIVES AS WELL AS NURSES THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WHO NEVER SEE A NURSE OR A PHYSICIAN UNDER THIS SECTION EVEN AS IT NOW STANDS PHYSICIANS HAVE A RIGHT TO PRESCRIBE CONTRACEPTIVES
4731-95875-0035 BUT FEW OF THEM HAVE CLAIMED THAT RIGHT OR HAVE EVEN KNOWN THAT IT HAS EXISTED IT DOES EXIST HOWEVER AND WAS SPECIFICALLY DECLARED BY THE NEW YORK STATE COURT OF APPEALS AS WE SHALL SEE WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT COURT'S OPINION IN THE SANGER CASE FARTHER ON IN THE BOOK
4731-95875-0036 IT CAN DO NO HARM TO MAKE THE INTENT OF THE LAW AS REGARDS PHYSICIANS PLAINER AND IT WOULD BE AN IMMENSE STEP FORWARD TO INCLUDE NURSES AND MIDWIVES IN THE SECTION WITH THIS ADDITION IT WOULD REMOVE ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS OBSTACLES TO THE FREEDOM AND ADVANCEMENT OF AMERICAN WOMANHOOD
4731-95875-0037 AND WHO ARE NOT YET SUFFERING FROM DISEASES COMPLICATED BY PREGNANCY
4731-95875-0038 IT IS EACH WOMAN'S DUTY TO HERSELF AND TO SOCIETY TO HASTEN THE REPEAL OF ALL LAWS AGAINST THE COMMUNICATION OF BIRTH CONTROL INFORMATION NOW THAT SHE HAS THE VOTE SHE SHOULD USE HER POLITICAL INFLUENCE TO STRIKE FIRST OF ALL AT THESE RESTRICTIVE STATUTES
4731-95875-0039 IS IN THIS DIRECTION THESE LAWS WERE MADE BY MEN AND HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTS OF MARTYRDOM AND DEATH FOR UNNUMBERED THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WOMEN NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SWEEP THEM INTO THE TRASH HEAP THEY WILL DO IT AT ONCE UNLESS LIKE MEN
