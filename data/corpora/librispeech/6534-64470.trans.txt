6534-64470-0000 THEY JUDGED IT BETTER THEREFORE AS MARJORIE SAID IN HER LETTER TO FEIGN UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF ANY CHARGE AGAINST THEM SINCE THERE WAS NO PRIEST IN THE HOUSE WHO COULD INCRIMINATE THEM ALL THIS THE TRAVELLERS LEARNED FOR THE FIRST TIME AT LANGLEY
6534-64470-0001 MISTER COLUMBELL HIMSELF CAME WITH A SCORE OF MEN AND SURROUNDED THE HOUSE VERY EARLY HAVING SET WATCHERS ALL IN PLACE THE EVENING BEFORE THEY HAD MADE CERTAIN THEY SHOULD CATCH THE MASTER AND AT LEAST A PRIEST OR TWO
6534-64470-0002 BUT I HAVE VERY HEAVY NEWS FOR ALL THAT FOR THERE HAD COME TO THE HOUSE AFTER DARK MISTER ANTHONY FITZ HERBERT WITH TWO OF HIS SISTERS MISSUS THOMAS FITZ HERBERT AND MISTER FENTON HIMSELF
6534-64470-0003 AND THAT HIS OWN TAKING HE PUTS DOWN TO HIS BROTHER'S ACCOUNT AS YOURSELF SIR ALSO DID THE MEN DID NO GREAT HARM IN PADLEY BEYOND BREAKING A PANEL OR TWO
6534-64470-0004 AND THEY FOUND NONE OF THE HIDING HOLES WHICH IS GOOD NEWS THE REST OF THE PARTY THEY LET GO FREE AGAIN FOR THE PRESENT I HAVE ANOTHER PIECE OF BAD NEWS TOO WHICH IS NO MORE THAN WHAT WE HAD LOOKED FOR
6534-64470-0005 AND BRING HIM TO A BETTER MIND SO THAT HE HATH NOT YET DENIED OUR LORD EVEN THOUGH HE HATH PROMISED TO DO SO MAY GOD COMFORT AND CONSOLE YOU MISTER FITZ HERBERT FOR THIS NEWS OF MISTER ANTHONY THAT I SEND
6534-64470-0006 THE LETTER ENDED WITH MESSAGES TO THE PARTY WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR THEIR WAY OF RETURN IF THEY SHOULD COME WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK AND WITH THE EXPLANATION GIVEN ABOVE OF THE SERIES OF MISFORTUNES BY WHICH ANY CAME TO BE AT PADLEY THAT NIGHT
6534-64470-0007 THE FORMER BLOWS PREPARE HIM AND DULL HIS NERVES FOR THE LATER WHICH I TAKE IT IS PART OF GOD'S MERCY WELL MISTER ALBAN MY FATHER HATH BEEN IN PRISON A GREAT WHILE NOW MY SON THOMAS IS A TRAITOR AND A SWORN MAN OF HER GRACE
6534-64470-0008 MORE THAN THE PAIN I HAVE IN THINKING ON HIS SUFFERINGS THE ONE MAY PERHAPS ATONE FOR THE SINS OF THE OTHER AND YET HELP HIM TO REPENTANCE LIFE HERE AT LANGLEY WAS MORE ENCOURAGING THAN THE FURTIVE EXISTENCE NECESSARY IN THE NORTH OF DERBYSHIRE
6534-64470-0009 MISTER BASSETT HAD A CONFIDENT WAY WITH HIM THAT WAS LIKE WINE TO FAINTING HEARTS AND HE HAD EVERY REASON TO BE CONFIDENT SINCE UP TO THE PRESENT BEYOND BEING FORCED TO PAY THE USUAL FINES FOR RECUSANCY HE HAD SCARCELY BEEN TROUBLED AT ALL
6534-64470-0010 AND LIVED IN CONSIDERABLE PROSPERITY HAVING EVEN BEEN SHERIFF OF STAFFORD IN VIRTUE OF HIS OTHER ESTATES AT BLORE HIS HOUSE AT LANGLEY WAS A GREAT ONE STANDING IN A PARK AND SHOWING NO SIGNS OF POVERTY HIS SERVANTS WERE LARGELY CATHOLIC
6534-64470-0011 HE ENTERTAINED PRIESTS AND REFUGEES OF ALL KINDS FREELY ALTHOUGH DISCREETLY AND HE LAUGHED AT THE NOTION THAT THE PERSECUTION COULD BE
6534-64470-0012 I HAVE NO TASTE TO BE A SPANISH SUBJECT WHY NOR HAVE I BUT THE KING OF SPAIN WILL BUT SAIL AWAY AGAIN WHEN HE HATH MADE TERMS AGAINST THE PRIVATEERS
6534-64470-0013 AND LO WHEN WE LOOKED AGAIN THE BAG WAS GONE
6534-64470-0014 CERTAINLY HE WAS AN INSPIRITING MAN WITH A LOUD BARK OF HIS OWN BUT ROBIN IMAGINED THAT HE WOULD NOT BITE TOO CRUELLY FOR ALL THAT BUT HE SAW ANOTHER SIDE OF HIM PRESENTLY
6534-64470-0015 WHAT WAS THAT MATTER OF MISTER SUTTON THE PRIEST WHO WAS EXECUTED IN STAFFORD LAST YEAR ASKED MISTER JOHN SUDDENLY
6534-64470-0016 HIS EYES BECAME PIN POINTS UNDER HIS GREY EYEBROWS AND HIS MOUTH TIGHTENED WHAT OF HIM HE SAID IT WAS REPORTED THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE STAYED THE EXECUTION AND WOULD NOT I DID NOT BELIEVE A WORD OF IT IT IS TRUE SAID MISTER BASSETT SHARPLY
6534-64470-0017 AT LEAST A PORTION OF IT TRUE LISTEN CRIED THE OTHER SUDDENLY AND TELL ME WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE MISTER SUTTON WAS TAKEN AND WAS BANISHED AND CAME BACK AGAIN AS ANY WORTHY PRIEST WOULD DO THEN HE WAS TAKEN AGAIN AND CONDEMNED
6534-64470-0018 THEN AS I WOULD NEVER HAVE ANY PART IN THE DEATH OF A PRIEST FOR HIS RELIGION ANOTHER WAS APPOINTED TO CARRY THE EXECUTION THROUGH
6534-64470-0019 AND OF HOUSES WHERE HE HAD SAID MASS AND I KNOW NOT WHAT ELSE
6534-64470-0020 NOW I KNEW THAT I COULD NOT SAVE HIS LIFE ALTOGETHER THAT WAS FORFEITED AND THERE COULD BE NO FORGIVENESS ALL THAT I MIGHT DO WAS TO RESPITE HIM FOR A LITTLE
6534-64470-0021 THAT HE MIGHT DAMN HIS OWN SOUL ETERNALLY
6534-64470-0022 I SENT THE MESSENGER AWAY AGAIN AND SAID THAT I WOULD LISTEN TO NO SUCH TALES AND MISTER SUTTON DIED LIKE A GOOD PRIEST THREE DAYS AFTER REPENTING I DOUBT NOT BITTERLY OF THE WEAKNESS INTO WHICH HE HAD FALLEN NOW SIR WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IN MY PLACE
6534-64470-0023 TWO THE EVENING BEFORE THE TWO LEFT FOR THE NORTH AGAIN MISTER BASSETT TOOK THEM BOTH INTO HIS OWN STUDY IT WAS A LITTLE ROOM OPENING OUT OF HIS BEDROOM
6534-64470-0024 ANY ROOM IN THE WORLD A SHELF RAN ROUND THE ROOM HIGH ON THE WALL AND WAS PILED WITH MANUSCRIPTS TO THE CEILING BENEATH THE BOOK SHELVES THAT RAN NEARLY ROUND THE ROOM WERE PACKED WITH VOLUMES
6534-64470-0025 ROBIN LOOKED ROUND HIM IN WONDER HE HAD NO IDEA THAT HIS HOST WAS A MAN OF SUCH LEARNING ALL THE BOOKS ARE RANGED IN THEIR PROPER PLACES WENT ON THE OTHER
6534-64470-0026 I COULD PUT MY FINGER ON ANY OF THEM BLIND FOLD BUT THIS IS THE SHELF I WISHED YOU TO SEE HE TOOK HIM TO ONE THAT WAS BEHIND THE DOOR HOLDING UP THE CANDLE THAT HE MIGHT SEE THE SHELF HAD A BOX OR TWO ON IT BESIDES BOOKS
6534-64470-0027 AND THESE HE OPENED AND SET ON THE TABLE ROBIN LOOKED IN AS HE WAS TOLD BUT COULD UNDERSTAND NOTHING THAT HE SAW IN ONE WAS A ROUND BALL OF CRYSTAL ON A LITTLE GOLD STAND WRAPPED ROUND IN VELVET
6534-64470-0028 HE INSPECTED THEM GRAVELY BUT WAS NOT INVITED TO TOUCH THEM THEN HIS HOST TOUCHED HIM ON THE BREAST WITH ONE FINGER AND RECOILED SMILING THIS IS MY MAGIC HE SAID JOHN HERE DOES NOT LIKE IT
6534-64470-0029 NEITHER DID POOR MISTER FENTON WHEN HE WAS HERE BUT I HOLD THERE IS NO HARM IN SUCH THINGS IF ONE DOES BUT OBSERVE CAUTION
6534-64470-0030 INQUIRED THE PRIEST CURIOUSLY FOR HE WAS NOT SURE WHETHER THE MAN WAS SERIOUS WELL SIR I HOLD THAT GOD HAS WRITTEN HIS WILL IN THE STARS AND IN THE BURNING OF HERBS AND IN THE SHINING OF THE SUN AND SUCH THINGS THERE IS NO BLACK MAGIC HERE
6534-64470-0031 BUT JUST AS WE READ IN THE SKY AT MORNING IF IT BE RED OR YELLOW WHETHER IT WILL BE FOUL OR FAIR SO I HOLD THAT GOD HAS WRITTEN OTHER SECRETS OF HIS IN OTHER THINGS AND THAT BY OBSERVING THEM AND JUDGING RIGHTLY WE MAY GUESS WHAT HE HAS IN STORE
6534-64470-0032 I KNEW THAT A PRINCE
6534-64470-0033 AND I WOULD HAVE YOU NOTICE THAT HERE ARE MISTER FITZ HERBERT AND YOUR REVERENCE TOO FLEEING FOR YOUR LIVES AND HERE SIT I SAFE AT HOME AND ALL AS I HOLD BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OBSERVE BY MY MAGIC WHAT IS TO COME TO PASS
6534-64470-0034 BUT THAT STRIKES AT THE DOCTRINE OF FREE WILL CRIED THE PRIEST NO SIR I THINK IT DOES NOT GOD'S FOREKNOWLEDGE DOTH NOT HINDER THE USE OF OUR FREE WILL WHICH IS A MYSTERY NO DOUBT YET NONE THE LESS TRUE
6534-64470-0035 THEN WHY SHOULD GOD'S FOREKNOWLEDGE ANY MORE HINDER OUR FREE WILL WHEN HE CHOOSES TO COMMUNICATE IT TO US ROBIN WAS SILENT
6534-64470-0036 EXCEPT FROM HIS THEOLOGICAL READING YET HE FELT UNEASY THE OTHER SAID NOTHING AND THE STARS TOO HE ASKED
6534-64470-0037 I DO NOT HOLD THAT WE ARE SO RULED BY THESE THAT WE HAVE NO ACTION OF OUR OWN ANY MORE THAN WE ARE COMPELLED TO BE WET THROUGH BY RAIN OR SCORCHED BY THE SUN WE MAY ALWAYS COME INTO A HOUSE OR SHELTER BENEATH A TREE AND THUS ESCAPE THEM SO TOO I HOLD WITH THE STARS
6534-64470-0038 ROBIN LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM IT WAS DARK OUTSIDE LONG AGO THEY HAD SUPPED AT SUNSET AND SAT FOR HALF AN HOUR OVER THEIR BANQUET OF SWEETMEATS AND WINE BEFORE COMING UPSTAIRS AND THE ROOM TOO WAS AS DARK AS NIGHT
6534-64470-0039 EXCEPT WHERE FAR OFF IN THE WEST BEYOND THE TALL TREES OF THE PARK A FEW RED STREAKS LINGERED HE FELT OPPRESSED AND MISERABLE
6534-64470-0040 YET HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY MISTER JOHN HAD WANDERED OFF TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS AND WAS HUMMING UNEASILY TO HIMSELF THEN SUDDENLY AN INTENSE CURIOSITY OVERCAME HIM HIS LIFE WAS A STRANGE AND PERILOUS ONE
6534-64470-0041 HE CARRIED IT IN HIS HAND EVERY DAY IN THE MORNING HE COULD NOT BE SURE BUT THAT HE WOULD BE FLEEING BEFORE EVENING AS HE FELL ASLEEP HE COULD NOT BE SURE THAT HE WOULD NOT BE AWAKENED TO A NEW DREAM
6534-64470-0042 WHICH IN SPITE OF HIS COURAGE HAD COME DOWN ON HIM SOMETIMES IN SOME LONELY FARM PERHAPS WHERE FLIGHT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE OR IN WHAT WAS FAR MORE DANGEROUS IN SOME CROWDED INN WHERE EVERY MOVEMENT WAS KNOWN
6534-64470-0043 THESE HAD PASSED HE THOUGHT NEVER TO COME BACK BUT IN THAT LITTLE BOOK LINED ROOM WITH THESE CURIOUS THINGS IN BOXES ON THE TABLE AND HIS MERRY HOST PEERING AT HIM GRAVELY AND THE STILL EVENING OUTSIDE
6534-64470-0044 WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT TO MORROW HE WAS TO RIDE BACK TO HIS OWN COUNTRY WHENCE HE HAD FLED FOR FEAR OF HIS LIFE SIX WEEKS AGO
