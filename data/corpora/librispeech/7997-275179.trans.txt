7997-275179-0000 IN CANADA WITH A LYNX BY ROE L HENDRICK THIS ADVENTURE CAME ABOUT THROUGH AN INVITATION WHICH RAY CHURCHILL RECEIVED FROM HIS FRIEND JACQUES POURBIERE OF TWO RIVERS NEW BRUNSWICK
7997-275179-0001 RAY HAD HALF PROMISED TO VISIT HIS NEW BRUNSWICK ACQUAINTANCE DURING THE DEER HUNTING SEASON AND LATE IN AUGUST WAS REMINDED OF THE FACT A SECOND LETTER CAME IN SEPTEMBER THE CAREFULLY WORDED SCHOOL ENGLISH OF THE WRITER
7997-275179-0002 NOT BEING ABLE TO CONCEAL THE WARMTH AND URGENCY OF THE INVITATION SO RAY TELEGRAPHED HIS ACCEPTANCE AND FOUR DAYS LATER ARRIVED AT FREDERICTON WHERE HE SECURED A HUNTING LICENSE THE NEXT MORNING HE REACHED TWO RIVERS AND JACQUES MET HIM
7997-275179-0003 HE PROMISED RAY AT LEAST ONE DEER WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS AND ANOTHER WITHIN A WEEK THE POURBIERE HOME RESEMBLED THOSE OF THE BETTER CLASS OF HABITANTS BUT WITH A DIFFERENCE DUE TO THE GREATER PROSPERITY OF THE FAMILY IN PRECEDING GENERATIONS
7997-275179-0004 THE MAIN ROOM HAD A HUGE FIREPLACE USED ONLY OCCASIONALLY FOR THERE WAS AN AIR TIGHT STOVE CONNECTED WITH THE CHIMNEY JUST ABOVE IT TO AFFORD GREATER WARMTH IN WINTER THE OTHER ROOMS WERE CHIEFLY DETACHED
7997-275179-0005 WERE IN THE REAR EACH BEING A RECTANGULAR BUILDING OF HEAVY LOGS WITH LOW LOFTS ABOVE THE HOMESTEAD WAS IN FACT A CLUSTER OF HOUSES RATHER THAN A SINGLE DWELLING
7997-275179-0006 WHAT MOST ATTRACTED RAY'S ATTENTION WERE THE HUGE BEDSTEADS IN THE LIVING ROOM THEY WERE TALL FOUR POSTERS SUCH AS HE HAD SEEN ELSEWHERE BUT WITH THE DIFFERENCE THAT A CANOPY COVERED THEM
7997-275179-0007 EACH HAD A CARVED WOODEN FRAME SURMOUNTING THE TOP OF THE POSTS LIKE A ROOF THE WOOD WAS BLACK WITH AGE ITS SURFACE BEING COVERED WITH ELABORATE FOLIAGE AND ARMORIAL DEVICES
7997-275179-0008 REPRESENTING THE TOIL OF SOME OLD FRENCH ARTISAN OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THEY PROBABLY HAD BEEN BROUGHT ACROSS THE ATLANTIC BY THE ORIGINAL EMIGRANT AND CAREFULLY PRESERVED EVER SINCE
7997-275179-0009 THEY STOOD IN DIAGONALLY OPPOSITE CORNERS OF THE ROOM AND UPHELD THE HUGEST OF FEATHER BEDS WITH GAY HOME MADE WORSTED COVERLETS AND VALANCES THAT SHAMED THE HUES OF THE RAINBOW
7997-275179-0010 THEY CERTAINLY TEMPTED TO REST IN THAT CLIMATE AND AT THAT SEASON BUT WOULD HAVE SEEMED SUFFOCATING IN A WARMER REGION THAT EVENING RAY SAID SEE HERE JACQUES YOU HAVE DOUBLE WINDOWS
7997-275179-0011 AND YOUR FIREPLACE IS CLOSED TO MAKE A BETTER DRAFT FOR THIS STOVE I'M USED TO FRESH AIR AT NIGHT IF I LEAVE THE END DOOR AJAR YOU WON'T BE AFRAID OF BURGLARS WILL YOU THE CANADIAN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
7997-275179-0012 AT THIS EXHIBITION OF HIS GUEST'S ECCENTRICITY BUT HIS HOSPITALITY WAS MORE THAN EQUAL TO THE STRAIN NON NON HE REPLIED
7997-275179-0013 AND HIS WHITE TEETH FLASHED RAY LAUGHED SOFTLY AS HE THRUST A BILLET OF WOOD BETWEEN THE DOOR AND ITS FRAME
7997-275179-0014 HE ASKED CO OLD
7997-275179-0015 IF YOU BREATHED PURER AIR WHEN YOU SLEPT OUI WAS THE POLITE REPLY AND NOTHING MORE WAS SAID LONG BEFORE DAWN RAY SPRANG FROM BED CLOSED THE DOOR AND STIRRED UP THE FIRE
7997-275179-0016 THE MOON ALTHOUGH LOW IN THE WEST WAS STILL BRILLIANT WHEN THEY MADE THEIR WAY TO WHERE A STREAM TRICKLED DOWN TO CEDAR LAKE AND WITHIN A HALF HOUR GOT THEIR FIRST DEER A FINE THREE YEAR OLD BUCK
7997-275179-0017 THEY SECURED SOME SMALLER GAME DURING THE MORNING AND IN THE AFTERNOON TOOK THE DEER HOME AND SKINNED AND DRESSED IT
7997-275179-0018 BUT JACQUES CARRIED A HIND QUARTER IN AND SUSPENDED IT BESIDE THE CLOSED FIREPLACE LATER CUTTING OFF STEAKS FOR SUPPER AND BREAKFAST THEY PASSED A MERRY EVENING EACH TELLING STORIES OF HIS EXPERIENCES
7997-275179-0019 WHICH WERE SO DIFFERENT IN QUALITY THAT THEY POSSESSED ALL THE CHARM OF NOVELTY TO THE RESPECTIVE LISTENERS AGAIN RAY SET THE DOOR AJAR AFTER THEY HAD UNDRESSED AND IN A FEW MOMENTS BOTH WERE ASLEEP SEVERAL HOURS PASSED
7997-275179-0020 HAD EITHER YOUNG MAN BEEN AWAKE HE MIGHT HAVE HEARD SOFT FOOTFALLS ABOUT THE DOOR A SQUATTY HEAVILY BUILT ANIMAL WITH HUGE FEET BOB TAIL AND POINTED EARS ADORNED WITH TUFTS OF HAIR
7997-275179-0021 HAD TRACED THE SLAUGHTERED DEER TO THE FARMHOUSE BY MEANS OF DROPS OF BLOOD AND NOW WAS SEARCHING EAGERLY FOR THE MEAT HE SOUGHT THE MILK ROOM AGAIN AND AGAIN AND EVEN SPRANG TO THE WINDOW LEDGE BUT COULD NOT GET INSIDE
7997-275179-0022 THEN HE CAME BACK AND SNIFFED AT THE PARTLY OPEN DOOR OF THE LIVING ROOM THE HUMAN SMELL WAS THERE AND HE HESITATED BUT SO TOO WAS THE ODOR OF FRESH VENISON AND HIS MOUTH WATERED
7997-275179-0023 A ROUND HEAD WAS THRUST INSIDE THE DOOR THE MOON PEERING ABOVE THE HEMLOCKS TO THE SOUTHEASTWARD CAST ITS RAYS THROUGH A WINDOW DIRECTLY UPON THE FRESH MEAT THE TEMPTATION WAS GREATER THAN THE INTRUDER WAS ABLE TO WITHSTAND
7997-275179-0024 INCH BY INCH HE CROWDED PAST THE SWAYING DOOR AND SILENTLY CREPT TOWARD THE VENISON THE TWO MEN WERE BREATHING VERY LOUDLY BUT NEITHER STIRRED
7997-275179-0025 AND AT LAST HE GATHERED SUPREME COURAGE AND LEAPED UPON THE MEAT IT FELL WITH A CRASH AGAINST THE STOVE AND THE TWO WERE AWAKENED SIMULTANEOUSLY AS JACQUES SPRANG FROM THE BED
7997-275179-0026 THE ANIMAL BACKED DRAGGING THE QUARTER OF VENISON TOWARD THE DOOR HE COLLIDED WITH IT KNOCKING THE BILLET OF WOOD OUTSIDE AND THE LATCH FELL INTO PLACE WITH A CLASH FINDING HIMSELF A PRISONER
7997-275179-0027 THE CREATURE ADVANCED SPITTING AND GROWLING STRAIGHT AT JACQUES WHO CRYING
7997-275179-0028 BUT THE PURSUIT DID NOT END THERE SEEING THAT THE BEAST WAS ABOUT TO LEAP UPON THE BED
7997-275179-0029 NOT A SECOND TOO SOON AND ENSCONCED HIMSELF ON THE EDGE OF THE CANOPY TOP WITH HIS BACK PRESSED AGAINST THE TIMBERS OF THE LOFT FLOOR ABOVE RAY HAD BEEN TOO MUCH AMAZED TO INTERFERE AT FIRST BUT NOW THE TIME SEEMED RIPE TO REOPEN THE DOOR
7997-275179-0030 AND DRIVE THE LYNX OUT HE MADE A RUSH BUT THE ANGRY CREATURE TURNED AND DASHED AT HIS LEGS SO VICIOUSLY THAT IN A COUPLE OF SECONDS HE TOO FOUND HIMSELF PERCHED PRECARIOUSLY ON THE CANOPY OF HIS OWN BED
7997-275179-0031 WITH PRICK EARS SPITTING AND SNARLING ON THE COVERLET CAN THAT BEAST CLIMB UP HERE LIKE A CAT HE ASKED WITH NO LITTLE ANXIETY IN HIS TONES OUI WAS THE REPLY HE CAN
7997-275179-0032 WENT BACK TO THE VENISON AND BEGAN EATING IT VORACIOUSLY ONLY STOPPING TO SNARL WHEN THE YOUNG MEN SPOKE OR MOVED THE FIRE WAS VERY LOW THE ROOM HAD BEEN WELL AIRED AND THE TWO WERE THINLY CLAD
7997-275179-0033 BEFORE LONG THEIR TEETH WERE CHATTERING EEF AH CAN GET HEEM AWAY FROM DOOR
7997-275179-0034 JACQUES SAID WITH MARKED ILL WILL UNDERLYING HIS QUAINT ENGLISH HE CLAMBERED ABOUT THE CREAKING CANOPY FRAME WHICH THREATENED TO COLLAPSE AT ANY MOMENT
7997-275179-0035 HAD BEEN CONCEALED BENEATH THIS BED DURING THE PRECEDING SCRIMMAGE SHE NOW THRUST OUT HER HEAD JUST IN TIME TO BE SEEN BY THE LYNX AND THE LIVELIEST SORT OF CHASE ABOUT THE ROOM ENSUED WHEN HARD PRESSED SHE SOMEHOW REACHED A SHELF
7997-275179-0036 CLIMBED RECKLESSLY OVER HIM HER CLAWS STABBING HIM IN A DOZEN PLACES AND HID BEHIND HIM THE LYNX WAS THOROUGHLY AROUSED AND ALTHOUGH CLUMSIER AND HEAVIER SET OUT STURDILY TO FOLLOW
7997-275179-0037 RAY'S HAND FELL ON THE SHELF AND CLUTCHED A FLAT IRON OF WHICH THERE WERE A HALF DOZEN IN A ROW LEANING FORWARD HE STRUCK THE ONCOMER A HARD BLOW OVER THE HEAD PRICK EARS FELL TO THE FLOOR AND ROLLED WRITHING STRUGGLING
7997-275179-0038 AND HALF STUNNED UNDER THE BED NOW JACQUES NOW RAY YELLED HIS HOST JUMPED AND WAS OUTSIDE THE DOOR IN AN INSTANT RAY GRASPED ANOTHER FLAT IRON AND WAITED THE SOUND OF STRUGGLING BENEATH THE BED WAS UNABATED
7997-275179-0039 IN FIVE MINUTES HE HEARD A PLAINTIVE VOICE CALLING OUTSIDE
7997-275179-0040 OUI BUT WHERE AH'M FREEZING I I DON'T REMEMBER JACQUES SAYING MANY THINGS IN A PATOIS HE HAD NEVER LEARNED IN THE PROVINCIAL SCHOOL WENT BACK TO THE MILK ROOM THE LYNX VENTURED TO SHOW HIS HEAD
7997-275179-0041 AND A FLAT IRON DENTED THE FLOOR CLOSE BESIDE IT THEN THE ANIMAL CIRCLED THE ROOM DODGED ANOTHER MISSILE AND HID IN A DARK CORNER RAY COULD HEAR JACQUES TOSSING THINGS ABOUT IN THE OBSCURITY OF THE MILK ROOM
7997-275179-0042 BUT PLAINLY FINDING NO GUNS AND AS PLAINLY GETTING COLDER EVERY MINUTE SOMETHING MUST BE DONE AT ONCE HE CLUTCHED A FLAT IRON IN EACH HAND SCREWED HIS COURAGE TO THE STICKING POINT AND DROPPED TO THE FLOOR
7997-275179-0043 AS HE FLUNG THE DOOR WIDE OPEN HE HEARD THE RASPING OF THE LYNX'S CLAWS ON THE BOARDS BEHIND HIM HE DASHED OUTSIDE THREW BOTH FLAT IRONS WILDLY AT HIS PURSUER AND JUMPED AS FAR AS HE COULD TO ONE SIDE
7997-275179-0044 THE LYNX KEPT STRAIGHT ON HEADED FOR THE WOODS A FEW RODS AWAY JACQUES HAD FOUND HIS GUN AT LAST HE TOOK A FLYING SHOT IN THE MOONLIGHT HITTING A TREE AT LEAST A ROD AT THE LYNX'S RIGHT
7997-275179-0045 THEN THE TWO WENT INSIDE ENLIVENED THE FIRE AND DRESSED AS HASTILY AS POSSIBLE CONSUMPTION IS BAD VER BAD FOR CANADIANS SAID JACQUES A HALF HOUR LATER PICKING HIS WORDS WITH CARE
