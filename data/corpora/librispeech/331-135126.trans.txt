331-135126-0000 FROM MY BOYISH DAYS I HAD ALWAYS FELT A GREAT PERPLEXITY ON ONE POINT IN MACBETH IT WAS THIS THE KNOCKING AT THE GATE WHICH SUCCEEDS TO THE MURDER OF DUNCAN
331-135126-0001 PRODUCED TO MY FEELINGS AN EFFECT FOR WHICH I NEVER COULD ACCOUNT THE EFFECT WAS THAT IT REFLECTED BACK UPON THE MURDER A PECULIAR AWFULNESS AND A DEPTH OF SOLEMNITY
331-135126-0002 YET HOWEVER OBSTINATELY I ENDEAVORED WITH MY UNDERSTANDING TO COMPREHEND THIS FOR MANY YEARS I NEVER COULD SEE WHY IT SHOULD PRODUCE SUCH AN EFFECT HERE I PAUSE FOR ONE MOMENT TO EXHORT THE READER
331-135126-0003 AND THE MOST TO BE DISTRUSTED AND YET THE GREAT MAJORITY OF PEOPLE TRUST TO NOTHING ELSE WHICH MAY DO FOR ORDINARY LIFE BUT NOT FOR PHILOSOPHICAL PURPOSES OF THIS OUT OF TEN THOUSAND INSTANCES THAT I MIGHT PRODUCE
331-135126-0004 I WILL CITE ONE ASK OF ANY PERSON WHATSOEVER WHO IS NOT PREVIOUSLY PREPARED FOR THE DEMAND BY A KNOWLEDGE OF PERSPECTIVE TO DRAW IN THE RUDEST WAY THE COMMONEST APPEARANCE WHICH DEPENDS UPON THE LAWS OF THAT SCIENCE AS FOR INSTANCE
331-135126-0005 TO REPRESENT THE EFFECT OF TWO WALLS STANDING AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER OR THE APPEARANCE OF THE HOUSES ON EACH SIDE OF A STREET AS SEEN BY A PERSON LOOKING DOWN THE STREET FROM ONE EXTREMITY NOW IN ALL CASES
331-135126-0006 UNLESS THE PERSON HAS HAPPENED TO OBSERVE IN PICTURES HOW IT IS THAT ARTISTS PRODUCE THESE EFFECTS HE WILL BE UTTERLY UNABLE TO MAKE THE SMALLEST APPROXIMATION TO IT YET WHY
331-135126-0007 FOR HE HAS ACTUALLY SEEN THE EFFECT EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE THE REASON IS THAT HE ALLOWS HIS UNDERSTANDING TO OVERRULE HIS EYES
331-135126-0008 HIS UNDERSTANDING WHICH INCLUDES NO INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAWS OF VISION CAN FURNISH HIM WITH NO REASON WHY A LINE WHICH IS KNOWN AND CAN BE PROVED TO BE A HORIZONTAL LINE SHOULD NOT APPEAR A HORIZONTAL LINE
331-135126-0009 IN WHICH NOT ONLY THE UNDERSTANDING IS ALLOWED TO OVERRULE THE EYES BUT WHERE THE UNDERSTANDING IS POSITIVELY ALLOWED TO OBLITERATE THE EYES AS IT WERE
331-135126-0010 HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE HAS SEEN
331-135126-0011 THAT WHICH HE HAS SEEN EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE BUT TO RETURN FROM THIS DIGRESSION MY UNDERSTANDING
331-135126-0012 IN FACT MY UNDERSTANDING SAID POSITIVELY THAT IT COULD NOT PRODUCE ANY EFFECT BUT I KNEW BETTER I FELT THAT IT DID AND I WAITED AND CLUNG TO THE PROBLEM UNTIL FURTHER KNOWLEDGE SHOULD ENABLE ME TO SOLVE IT
331-135126-0013 AT LENGTH IN EIGHTEEN TWELVE MISTER WILLIAMS MADE HIS DEBUT ON THE STAGE OF RATCLIFFE HIGHWAY AND EXECUTED THOSE UNPARALLELED MURDERS WHICH HAVE PROCURED FOR HIM SUCH A BRILLIANT AND UNDYING REPUTATION
331-135126-0014 ON WHICH MURDERS BY THE WAY I MUST OBSERVE THAT IN ONE RESPECT THEY HAVE HAD AN ILL EFFECT BY MAKING THE CONNOISSEUR IN MURDER VERY FASTIDIOUS IN HIS TASTE
331-135126-0015 AND DISSATISFIED BY ANYTHING THAT HAS BEEN SINCE DONE IN THAT LINE ALL OTHER MURDERS LOOK PALE BY THE DEEP CRIMSON OF HIS AND AS AN AMATEUR ONCE SAID TO ME IN A QUERULOUS TONE
331-135126-0016 THERE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING DOING SINCE HIS TIME OR NOTHING THAT'S WORTH SPEAKING OF BUT THIS IS WRONG FOR IT IS UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT ALL MEN TO BE GREAT ARTISTS AND BORN WITH THE GENIUS OF MISTER WILLIAMS
331-135126-0017 NOW IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT IN THE FIRST OF THESE MURDERS THAT OF THE MARRS THE SAME INCIDENT
331-135126-0018 DID ACTUALLY OCCUR WHICH THE GENIUS OF SHAKSPEARE HAS INVENTED AND ALL GOOD JUDGES AND THE MOST EMINENT DILETTANTI ACKNOWLEDGED THE FELICITY OF SHAKSPEARE'S SUGGESTION
331-135126-0019 AND I AGAIN SET MYSELF TO STUDY THE PROBLEM AT LENGTH I SOLVED IT TO MY OWN SATISFACTION AND MY SOLUTION IS THIS MURDER
331-135126-0020 IN ORDINARY CASES WHERE THE SYMPATHY IS WHOLLY DIRECTED TO THE CASE OF THE MURDERED PERSON IS AN INCIDENT OF COARSE AND VULGAR HORROR AND FOR THIS REASON THAT IT FLINGS THE INTEREST EXCLUSIVELY UPON THE NATURAL
331-135126-0021 BUT IGNOBLE INSTINCT BY WHICH WE CLEAVE TO LIFE AN INSTINCT WHICH AS BEING INDISPENSABLE TO THE PRIMAL LAW OF SELF PRESERVATION
331-135126-0022 DIFFERENT IN DEGREE AMONGST ALL LIVING CREATURES THIS INSTINCT THEREFORE BECAUSE IT ANNIHILATES ALL DISTINCTIONS AND DEGRADES THE GREATEST OF MEN TO THE LEVEL OF THE POOR BEETLE THAT WE TREAD ON
331-135126-0023 EXHIBITS HUMAN NATURE IN ITS MOST ABJECT AND HUMILIATING ATTITUDE SUCH AN ATTITUDE WOULD LITTLE SUIT THE PURPOSES OF THE POET WHAT THEN MUST HE DO HE MUST THROW THE INTEREST ON THE MURDERER
331-135126-0024 OUR SYMPATHY MUST BE WITH HIM OF COURSE I MEAN A SYMPATHY OF COMPREHENSION A SYMPATHY BY WHICH WE ENTER INTO HIS FEELINGS AND ARE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THEM
331-135126-0025 ALL STRIFE OF THOUGHT ALL FLUX AND REFLUX OF PASSION AND OF PURPOSE ARE CRUSHED BY ONE OVERWHELMING PANIC THE FEAR OF INSTANT DEATH SMITES HIM WITH ITS PETRIFIC MACE
331-135126-0026 BUT IN THE MURDERER SUCH A MURDERER AS A POET WILL CONDESCEND TO THERE MUST BE RAGING SOME GREAT STORM OF PASSION JEALOUSY AMBITION VENGEANCE HATRED
331-135126-0027 WHICH WILL CREATE A HELL WITHIN HIM AND INTO THIS HELL WE ARE TO LOOK FOOTNOTE ONE
331-135126-0028 IT SEEMS ALMOST LUDICROUS TO GUARD AND EXPLAIN MY USE OF A WORD IN A SITUATION WHERE IT WOULD NATURALLY EXPLAIN ITSELF BUT IT HAS BECOME NECESSARY TO DO SO IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE UNSCHOLARLIKE USE OF THE WORD SYMPATHY
331-135126-0029 AT PRESENT SO GENERAL BY WHICH INSTEAD OF TAKING IT IN ITS PROPER SENSE AS THE ACT OF REPRODUCING IN OUR MINDS THE FEELINGS OF ANOTHER WHETHER FOR HATRED INDIGNATION LOVE PITY OR APPROBATION
331-135126-0030 FOR THE SAKE OF GRATIFYING HIS OWN ENORMOUS AND TEEMING FACULTY OF CREATION SHAKSPEARE HAS INTRODUCED TWO MURDERERS AND AS USUAL IN HIS HANDS THEY ARE REMARKABLY DISCRIMINATED
331-135126-0031 BUT THOUGH IN MACBETH THE STRIFE OF MIND IS GREATER THAN IN HIS WIFE THE TIGER SPIRIT NOT SO AWAKE AND HIS FEELINGS CAUGHT CHIEFLY BY CONTAGION FROM HER
331-135126-0032 THIS WAS TO BE EXPRESSED AND ON ITS OWN ACCOUNT AS WELL AS TO MAKE IT A MORE PROPORTIONABLE ANTAGONIST TO THE UNOFFENDING NATURE OF THEIR VICTIM THE GRACIOUS DUNCAN AND ADEQUATELY TO EXPOUND THE
331-135126-0033 DEEP DAMNATION OF HIS TAKING OFF THIS WAS TO BE EXPRESSED WITH PECULIAR ENERGY
331-135126-0034 AND AS THIS EFFECT IS MARVELLOUSLY ACCOMPLISHED IN THE DIALOGUES AND SOLILOQUIES THEMSELVES SO IT IS FINALLY CONSUMMATED BY THE EXPEDIENT UNDER CONSIDERATION AND IT IS TO THIS THAT I NOW SOLICIT THE READER'S ATTENTION
331-135126-0035 IF THE READER HAS EVER WITNESSED A WIFE DAUGHTER OR SISTER IN A FAINTING FIT
331-135126-0036 AND CHANCING TO WALK NEAR THE COURSE THROUGH WHICH IT PASSED HAS FELT POWERFULLY IN THE SILENCE AND DESERTION OF THE STREETS AND IN THE STAGNATION OF ORDINARY BUSINESS THE DEEP INTEREST WHICH AT THAT MOMENT WAS POSSESSING THE HEART OF MAN
331-135126-0037 IF ALL AT ONCE HE SHOULD HEAR THE DEATH LIKE STILLNESS BROKEN UP BY THE SOUND OF WHEELS RATTLING AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND MAKING KNOWN THAT THE TRANSITORY VISION WAS DISSOLVED HE WILL BE AWARE THAT AT NO MOMENT
331-135126-0038 AND MADE APPREHENSIBLE BY REACTION NOW APPLY THIS TO THE CASE IN MACBETH HERE AS I HAVE SAID
331-135126-0039 AND MADE SENSIBLE ANOTHER WORLD HAS STEPPED IN
331-135126-0040 THEY ARE TRANSFIGURED LADY MACBETH IS UNSEXED MACBETH HAS FORGOT THAT HE WAS BORN OF WOMAN BOTH ARE CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE OF DEVILS AND THE WORLD OF DEVILS IS SUDDENLY REVEALED
331-135126-0041 AND MADE PALPABLE IN ORDER THAT A NEW WORLD MAY STEP IN THIS WORLD MUST FOR A TIME DISAPPEAR THE MURDERERS AND THE MURDER MUST BE INSULATED
331-135126-0042 LOCKED UP AND SEQUESTERED IN SOME DEEP RECESS WE MUST BE MADE SENSIBLE THAT THE WORLD OF ORDINARY LIFE IS SUDDENLY ARRESTED LAID ASLEEP TRANCED RACKED INTO A DREAD ARMISTICE TIME MUST BE ANNIHILATED
331-135126-0043 RELATION TO THINGS WITHOUT ABOLISHED AND ALL MUST PASS SELF WITHDRAWN INTO A DEEP SYNCOPE AND SUSPENSION OF EARTHLY PASSION HENCE IT IS THAT WHEN THE DEED IS DONE WHEN THE WORK OF DARKNESS IS PERFECT
331-135126-0044 THEN THE WORLD OF DARKNESS PASSES AWAY LIKE A PAGEANTRY IN THE CLOUDS THE KNOCKING AT THE GATE IS HEARD AND IT MAKES KNOWN AUDIBLY THAT THE REACTION HAS COMMENCED THE HUMAN HAS MADE ITS REFLUX UPON THE FIENDISH
331-135126-0045 HAIL STORM AND THUNDER WHICH ARE TO BE STUDIED WITH ENTIRE SUBMISSION OF OUR OWN FACULTIES AND IN THE PERFECT FAITH THAT IN THEM THERE CAN BE NO TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE NOTHING USELESS OR INERT
