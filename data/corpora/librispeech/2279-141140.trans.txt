2279-141140-0000 SET OUT FOR BUENOS AYRES RIO SAUCE SIERRA VENTANA THIRD POSTA DRIVING HORSES BOLAS PARTRIDGES AND FOXES FEATURES OF THE COUNTRY
2279-141140-0001 LONG LEGGED PLOVER TERU TERO HAIL STORM NATURAL ENCLOSURES IN THE SIERRA TAPALGUEN FLESH OF PUMA MEAT DIET
2279-141140-0002 GUARDIA DEL MONTE EFFECTS OF CATTLE ON THE VEGETATION CARDOON BUENOS AYRES CORRAL WHERE CATTLE ARE SLAUGHTERED
2279-141140-0003 THOUGH WITH SOME DIFFICULTY AS THE FATHER OF ONE MAN WAS AFRAID TO LET HIM GO AND ANOTHER WHO SEEMED WILLING WAS DESCRIBED TO ME AS SO FEARFUL THAT I WAS AFRAID TO TAKE HIM
2279-141140-0004 FOR I WAS TOLD THAT EVEN IF HE SAW AN OSTRICH AT A DISTANCE HE WOULD MISTAKE IT FOR AN INDIAN AND WOULD FLY LIKE THE WIND AWAY THE DISTANCE TO BUENOS AYRES IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILES
2279-141140-0005 AND NEARLY THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH AN UNINHABITED COUNTRY WE STARTED EARLY IN THE MORNING ASCENDING A FEW HUNDRED FEET FROM THE BASIN OF GREEN TURF
2279-141140-0006 BUT THE ATMOSPHERE REMARKABLY HAZY I THOUGHT THE APPEARANCE FOREBODED A GALE BUT THE GAUCHOS SAID IT WAS OWING TO THE PLAIN AT SOME GREAT DISTANCE IN THE INTERIOR BEING ON FIRE
2279-141140-0007 AFTER A LONG GALLOP HAVING CHANGED HORSES TWICE WE REACHED THE RIO SAUCE IT IS A DEEP RAPID
2279-141140-0008 NOT ABOVE TWENTY FIVE FEET WIDE THE SECOND POSTA ON THE ROAD TO BUENOS AYRES STANDS ON ITS BANKS A LITTLE ABOVE THERE IS A FORD FOR HORSES WHERE THE WATER DOES NOT REACH TO THE HORSES BELLY
2279-141140-0009 BUT FROM THAT POINT IN ITS COURSE TO THE SEA IT IS QUITE IMPASSABLE AND HENCE MAKES A MOST USEFUL BARRIER AGAINST THE INDIANS INSIGNIFICANT AS THIS STREAM IS
2279-141140-0010 THE JESUIT FALCONER WHOSE INFORMATION IS GENERALLY SO VERY CORRECT FIGURES IT AS A CONSIDERABLE RIVER RISING AT THE FOOT OF THE CORDILLERA WITH RESPECT TO ITS SOURCE
2279-141140-0011 I DO NOT DOUBT THAT THIS IS THE CASE FOR THE GAUCHOS ASSURED ME THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DRY SUMMER THIS STREAM AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE COLORADO HAS PERIODICAL FLOODS
2279-141140-0012 WHICH CAN ONLY ORIGINATE IN THE SNOW MELTING ON THE ANDES IT IS EXTREMELY IMPROBABLE THAT A STREAM SO SMALL AS THE SAUCE THEN WAS SHOULD TRAVERSE THE ENTIRE WIDTH OF THE CONTINENT
2279-141140-0013 AND INDEED IF IT WERE THE RESIDUE OF A LARGE RIVER ITS WATERS AS IN OTHER ASCERTAINED CASES
2279-141140-0014 DURING THE WINTER WE MUST LOOK TO THE SPRINGS ROUND THE SIERRA VENTANA AS THE SOURCE OF ITS PURE AND LIMPID STREAM I SUSPECT THE PLAINS OF PATAGONIA LIKE THOSE OF AUSTRALIA
2279-141140-0015 ARE TRAVERSED BY MANY WATER COURSES WHICH ONLY PERFORM THEIR PROPER PARTS AT CERTAIN PERIODS PROBABLY THIS IS THE CASE WITH THE WATER WHICH FLOWS INTO THE HEAD OF PORT DESIRE AND LIKEWISE WITH THE RIO CHUPAT
2279-141140-0016 ON THE BANKS OF WHICH MASSES OF HIGHLY CELLULAR SCORIAE WERE FOUND BY THE OFFICERS EMPLOYED IN THE SURVEY AS IT WAS EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN WE ARRIVED WE TOOK FRESH HORSES
2279-141140-0017 AND A SOLDIER FOR A GUIDE AND STARTED FOR THE SIERRA DE LA VENTANA THIS MOUNTAIN IS VISIBLE FROM THE ANCHORAGE AT BAHIA BLANCA AND CAPTAIN FITZ ROY
2279-141140-0018 AN ALTITUDE VERY REMARKABLE ON THIS EASTERN SIDE OF THE CONTINENT I AM NOT AWARE THAT ANY FOREIGNER PREVIOUS TO MY VISIT HAD ASCENDED THIS MOUNTAIN
2279-141140-0019 AND INDEED VERY FEW OF THE SOLDIERS AT BAHIA BLANCA KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT HENCE WE HEARD OF BEDS OF COAL OF GOLD AND SILVER OF CAVES AND OF FORESTS ALL OF WHICH INFLAMED MY CURIOSITY
2279-141140-0020 ONLY TO DISAPPOINT IT THE DISTANCE FROM THE POSTA WAS ABOUT SIX LEAGUES OVER A LEVEL PLAIN OF THE SAME CHARACTER AS BEFORE THE RIDE WAS HOWEVER INTERESTING AS THE MOUNTAIN BEGAN TO SHOW ITS TRUE FORM
2279-141140-0021 WHEN WE REACHED THE FOOT OF THE MAIN RIDGE WE HAD MUCH DIFFICULTY IN FINDING ANY WATER AND WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO HAVE PASSED THE NIGHT WITHOUT ANY AT LAST
2279-141140-0022 WE DISCOVERED SOME BY LOOKING CLOSE TO THE MOUNTAIN FOR AT THE DISTANCE EVEN OF A FEW HUNDRED YARDS THE STREAMLETS WERE BURIED AND ENTIRELY LOST IN THE FRIABLE CALCAREOUS STONE AND LOOSE DETRITUS
2279-141140-0023 I DO NOT THINK NATURE EVER MADE A MORE SOLITARY DESOLATE PILE OF ROCK IT WELL DESERVES ITS NAME OF HURTADO OR SEPARATED THE MOUNTAIN IS STEEP
2279-141140-0024 EXTREMELY RUGGED AND BROKEN AND SO ENTIRELY DESTITUTE OF TREES AND EVEN BUSHES THAT WE ACTUALLY COULD NOT MAKE A SKEWER TO STRETCH OUT OUR MEAT OVER THE FIRE OF THISTLE STALKS
2279-141140-0025 WHICH NOT ONLY ABUTS AGAINST ITS STEEP SIDES BUT LIKEWISE SEPARATES THE PARALLEL RANGES THE UNIFORMITY OF THE COLOURING GIVES AN EXTREME QUIETNESS TO THE VIEW
2279-141140-0026 THE WHITISH GREY OF THE QUARTZ ROCK AND THE LIGHT BROWN OF THE WITHERED GRASS OF THE PLAIN BEING
2279-141140-0027 FROM CUSTOM ONE EXPECTS TO SEE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF A LOFTY AND BOLD MOUNTAIN A BROKEN COUNTRY STREWED OVER WITH HUGE FRAGMENTS HERE NATURE SHOWS
2279-141140-0028 THAT THE LAST MOVEMENT BEFORE THE BED OF THE SEA IS CHANGED INTO DRY LAND MAY SOMETIMES BE ONE OF TRANQUILLITY UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I WAS CURIOUS TO OBSERVE
2279-141140-0029 HOW FAR FROM THE PARENT ROCK ANY PEBBLES COULD BE FOUND ON THE SHORES OF BAHIA BLANCA AND NEAR THE SETTLEMENT THERE WERE SOME OF QUARTZ WHICH CERTAINLY MUST HAVE COME FROM THIS SOURCE
2279-141140-0030 THE DISTANCE IS FORTY FIVE MILES THE DEW WHICH IN THE EARLY PART OF THE NIGHT WETTED THE SADDLE CLOTHS UNDER WHICH WE SLEPT WAS IN THE MORNING FROZEN THE PLAIN
2279-141140-0031 THOUGH APPEARING HORIZONTAL HAD INSENSIBLY SLOPED UP TO A HEIGHT OF BETWEEN EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE SEA IN THE MORNING NINTH OF SEPTEMBER
2279-141140-0032 THE GUIDE TOLD ME TO ASCEND THE NEAREST RIDGE WHICH HE THOUGHT WOULD LEAD ME TO THE FOUR PEAKS THAT CROWN THE SUMMIT THE CLIMBING UP SUCH ROUGH ROCKS WAS VERY FATIGUING
2279-141140-0033 THE SIDES WERE SO INDENTED THAT WHAT WAS GAINED IN ONE FIVE MINUTES WAS OFTEN LOST IN THE NEXT AT LAST WHEN I REACHED THE RIDGE
2279-141140-0034 MY DISAPPOINTMENT WAS EXTREME IN FINDING A PRECIPITOUS VALLEY AS DEEP AS THE PLAIN WHICH CUT THE CHAIN TRANSVERSELY IN TWO AND SEPARATED ME FROM THE FOUR POINTS THIS VALLEY IS VERY NARROW
2279-141140-0035 BUT FLAT BOTTOMED AND IT FORMS A FINE HORSE PASS FOR THE INDIANS AS IT CONNECTS THE PLAINS ON THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN SIDES OF THE RANGE HAVING DESCENDED
2279-141140-0036 AND WHILE CROSSING IT I SAW TWO HORSES GRAZING I IMMEDIATELY HID MYSELF IN THE LONG GRASS AND BEGAN TO RECONNOITRE BUT AS I COULD SEE NO SIGNS OF INDIANS
2279-141140-0037 I PROCEEDED CAUTIOUSLY ON MY SECOND ASCENT IT WAS LATE IN THE DAY AND THIS PART OF THE MOUNTAIN LIKE THE OTHER WAS STEEP AND RUGGED
2279-141140-0038 BUT GOT THERE WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY EVERY TWENTY YARDS I HAD THE CRAMP IN THE UPPER PART OF BOTH THIGHS SO THAT I WAS AFRAID I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE GOT DOWN AGAIN
2279-141140-0039 IT WAS ALSO NECESSARY TO RETURN BY ANOTHER ROAD AS IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION TO PASS OVER THE SADDLE BACK I WAS THEREFORE OBLIGED TO GIVE UP THE TWO HIGHER PEAKS
2279-141140-0040 THEIR ALTITUDE WAS BUT LITTLE GREATER AND EVERY PURPOSE OF GEOLOGY HAD BEEN ANSWERED SO THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS NOT WORTH THE HAZARD OF ANY FURTHER EXERTION I PRESUME THE CAUSE OF THE CRAMP
2279-141140-0041 WAS THE GREAT CHANGE IN THE KIND OF MUSCULAR ACTION FROM THAT OF HARD RIDING TO THAT OF STILL HARDER CLIMBING IT IS A LESSON WORTH REMEMBERING AS IN SOME CASES IT MIGHT CAUSE MUCH DIFFICULTY
2279-141140-0042 I HAVE ALREADY SAID THE MOUNTAIN IS COMPOSED OF WHITE QUARTZ ROCK AND WITH IT A LITTLE GLOSSY CLAY SLATE IS ASSOCIATED AT THE HEIGHT OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE PLAIN
2279-141140-0043 PATCHES OF CONGLOMERATE ADHERED IN SEVERAL PLACES TO THE SOLID ROCK THEY RESEMBLED IN HARDNESS AND IN THE NATURE OF THE CEMENT THE MASSES WHICH MAY BE SEEN DAILY FORMING ON SOME COASTS
2279-141140-0044 I DO NOT DOUBT THESE PEBBLES WERE IN A SIMILAR MANNER AGGREGATED AT A PERIOD WHEN THE GREAT CALCAREOUS FORMATION WAS DEPOSITING BENEATH THE SURROUNDING SEA
2279-141140-0045 EVEN THE VIEW WAS INSIGNIFICANT A PLAIN LIKE THE SEA BUT WITHOUT ITS BEAUTIFUL COLOUR AND DEFINED OUTLINE THE SCENE HOWEVER WAS NOVEL AND A LITTLE DANGER LIKE SALT TO MEAT
2279-141140-0046 GAVE IT A RELISH THAT THE DANGER WAS VERY LITTLE WAS CERTAIN FOR MY TWO COMPANIONS MADE A GOOD FIRE A THING WHICH IS NEVER DONE WHEN IT IS SUSPECTED THAT INDIANS ARE NEAR I REACHED THE PLACE OF OUR BIVOUAC BY SUNSET
2279-141140-0047 AND DRINKING MUCH MATE AND SMOKING SEVERAL CIGARITOS SOON MADE UP MY BED FOR THE NIGHT THE WIND WAS VERY STRONG AND COLD BUT I NEVER SLEPT MORE COMFORTABLY SEPTEMBER
2279-141140-0048 HAVING FAIRLY SCUDDED BEFORE THE GALE WE ARRIVED BY THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY AT THE SAUCE POSTA IN THE ROAD WE SAW GREAT NUMBERS OF DEER AND NEAR THE MOUNTAIN A GUANACO THE PLAIN
2279-141140-0049 WHICH ABUTS AGAINST THE SIERRA IS TRAVERSED BY SOME CURIOUS GULLIES OF WHICH ONE WAS ABOUT TWENTY FEET WIDE AND AT LEAST THIRTY DEEP WE WERE OBLIGED IN CONSEQUENCE TO MAKE A CONSIDERABLE CIRCUIT
2279-141140-0050 BEFORE WE COULD FIND A PASS WE STAYED THE NIGHT AT THE POSTA THE CONVERSATION AS WAS GENERALLY THE CASE BEING ABOUT THE INDIANS THE SIERRA VENTANA WAS FORMERLY A GREAT PLACE OF RESORT AND THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO
2279-141140-0051 MY GUIDE HAD BEEN PRESENT WHEN MANY INDIANS WERE KILLED THE WOMEN ESCAPED TO THE TOP OF THE RIDGE AND FOUGHT MOST DESPERATELY WITH GREAT STONES MANY THUS SAVING THEMSELVES
2279-141140-0052 THE DISTANCE IS CALLED FIFTEEN LEAGUES BUT IT IS ONLY GUESS WORK AND IS GENERALLY OVERSTATED THE ROAD WAS UNINTERESTING OVER A DRY GRASSY PLAIN
2279-141140-0053 AND ON OUR LEFT HAND AT A GREATER OR LESS DISTANCE THERE WERE SOME LOW HILLS A CONTINUATION OF WHICH WE CROSSED CLOSE TO THE POSTA BEFORE OUR ARRIVAL
2279-141140-0054 WE MET A LARGE HERD OF CATTLE AND HORSES GUARDED BY FIFTEEN SOLDIERS BUT WE WERE TOLD MANY HAD BEEN LOST IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DRIVE ANIMALS ACROSS THE PLAINS
2279-141140-0055 FOR IF IN THE NIGHT A PUMA OR EVEN A FOX APPROACHES NOTHING CAN PREVENT THE HORSES DISPERSING IN EVERY DIRECTION AND A STORM WILL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT A SHORT TIME SINCE
2279-141140-0056 AN OFFICER LEFT BUENOS AYRES WITH FIVE HUNDRED HORSES AND WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE ARMY HE HAD UNDER TWENTY SOON AFTERWARDS WE PERCEIVED BY THE CLOUD OF DUST THAT A PARTY OF HORSEMEN WERE COMING TOWARDS US
2279-141140-0057 WHEN FAR DISTANT MY COMPANIONS KNEW THEM TO BE INDIANS BY THEIR LONG HAIR STREAMING BEHIND THEIR BACKS THE INDIANS GENERALLY HAVE A FILLET ROUND THEIR HEADS BUT NEVER ANY COVERING
2279-141140-0058 AND THEIR BLACK HAIR BLOWING ACROSS THEIR SWARTHY FACES HEIGHTENS TO AN UNCOMMON DEGREE THE WILDNESS OF THEIR APPEARANCE THEY TURNED OUT TO BE A PARTY OF BERNANTIO'S FRIENDLY TRIBE GOING TO A SALINA FOR SALT
2279-141140-0059 THE INDIANS EAT MUCH SALT THEIR CHILDREN SUCKING IT LIKE SUGAR THIS HABIT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE SPANISH GAUCHOS WHO LEADING THE SAME KIND OF LIFE EAT SCARCELY ANY
2279-141140-0060 PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON VEGETABLE FOOD WHO HAVE AN UNCONQUERABLE DESIRE FOR SALT THE INDIANS GAVE US GOOD HUMOURED NODS AS THEY PASSED AT FULL GALLOP DRIVING BEFORE THEM A TROOP OF HORSES
2279-141140-0061 WAITING FOR A TROOP OF SOLDIERS WHICH GENERAL ROSAS HAD THE KINDNESS TO SEND TO INFORM ME WOULD SHORTLY TRAVEL TO BUENOS AYRES AND HE ADVISED ME TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE ESCORT
2279-141140-0062 IN THE MORNING WE RODE TO SOME NEIGHBOURING HILLS TO VIEW THE COUNTRY AND TO EXAMINE THE GEOLOGY AFTER DINNER THE SOLDIERS DIVIDED THEMSELVES INTO TWO PARTIES FOR A TRIAL OF SKILL WITH THE BOLAS
2279-141140-0063 TWO SPEARS WERE STUCK IN THE GROUND TWENTY FIVE YARDS APART BUT THEY WERE STRUCK AND ENTANGLED ONLY ONCE IN FOUR OR FIVE TIMES THE BALLS CAN BE THROWN FIFTY OR SIXTY YARDS BUT WITH LITTLE CERTAINTY
2279-141140-0064 THIS HOWEVER DOES NOT APPLY TO A MAN ON HORSEBACK FOR WHEN THE SPEED OF THE HORSE IS ADDED TO THE FORCE OF THE ARM IT IS SAID THAT THEY CAN BE WHIRLED WITH EFFECT TO THE DISTANCE OF EIGHTY YARDS
2279-141140-0065 AS A PROOF OF THEIR FORCE I MAY MENTION THAT AT THE FALKLAND ISLANDS WHEN THE SPANIARDS MURDERED SOME OF THEIR OWN COUNTRYMEN AND ALL THE ENGLISHMEN A YOUNG FRIENDLY SPANIARD WAS RUNNING AWAY
2279-141140-0066 WHEN A GREAT TALL MAN BY NAME LUCIANO CAME AT FULL GALLOP AFTER HIM SHOUTING TO HIM TO STOP AND SAYING THAT HE ONLY WANTED TO SPEAK TO HIM JUST AS THE SPANIARD WAS ON THE POINT OF REACHING THE BOAT LUCIANO THREW THE BALLS
2279-141140-0067 THEY STRUCK HIM ON THE LEGS WITH SUCH A JERK AS TO THROW HIM DOWN AND TO RENDER HIM FOR SOME TIME INSENSIBLE THE MAN AFTER LUCIANO HAD HAD HIS TALK WAS ALLOWED TO ESCAPE
2279-141140-0068 AS IF HE HAD BEEN FLOGGED WITH A WHIP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY TWO MEN ARRIVED WHO BROUGHT A PARCEL FROM THE NEXT POSTA TO BE FORWARDED TO THE GENERAL SO THAT BESIDES THESE TWO OUR PARTY CONSISTED THIS EVENING OF MY GUIDE AND SELF
2279-141140-0069 THE LIEUTENANT AND HIS FOUR SOLDIERS THE LATTER WERE STRANGE BEINGS THE FIRST A FINE YOUNG NEGRO THE SECOND HALF INDIAN AND NEGRO AND THE TWO OTHERS NON DESCRIPTS NAMELY
2279-141140-0070 AN OLD CHILIAN MINER THE COLOUR OF MAHOGANY AND ANOTHER PARTLY A MULATTO BUT TWO SUCH MONGRELS WITH SUCH DETESTABLE EXPRESSIONS I NEVER SAW BEFORE
2279-141140-0071 AT NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE SITTING ROUND THE FIRE AND PLAYING AT CARDS I RETIRED TO VIEW SUCH A SALVATOR ROSA SCENE THEY WERE SEATED UNDER A LOW CLIFF SO THAT I COULD LOOK DOWN UPON THEM
2279-141140-0072 AROUND THE PARTY WERE LYING DOGS ARMS REMNANTS OF DEER AND OSTRICHES AND THEIR LONG SPEARS WERE STUCK IN THE TURF FURTHER IN THE DARK BACKGROUND THEIR HORSES WERE TIED UP
2279-141140-0073 READY FOR ANY SUDDEN DANGER IF THE STILLNESS OF THE DESOLATE PLAIN WAS BROKEN BY ONE OF THE DOGS BARKING A SOLDIER LEAVING THE FIRE WOULD PLACE HIS HEAD CLOSE TO THE GROUND AND THUS SLOWLY SCAN THE HORIZON
2279-141140-0074 EVEN IF THE NOISY TERU TERO UTTERED ITS SCREAM THERE WOULD BE A PAUSE IN THE CONVERSATION AND EVERY HEAD FOR A MOMENT A LITTLE INCLINED
2279-141140-0075 WHAT A LIFE OF MISERY THESE MEN APPEAR TO US TO LEAD THEY WERE AT LEAST TEN LEAGUES FROM THE SAUCE POSTA AND SINCE THE MURDER COMMITTED BY THE INDIANS TWENTY FROM ANOTHER
2279-141140-0076 THE INDIANS ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE MADE THEIR ATTACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT FOR VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING AFTER THE MURDER THEY WERE LUCKILY SEEN APPROACHING THIS POSTA THE WHOLE PARTY HERE HOWEVER ESCAPED
2279-141140-0077 EACH ONE TAKING A LINE FOR HIMSELF AND DRIVING WITH HIM AS MANY ANIMALS AS HE WAS ABLE TO MANAGE THE LITTLE HOVEL BUILT OF THISTLE STALKS IN WHICH THEY SLEPT
2279-141140-0078 NEITHER KEPT OUT THE WIND NOR RAIN INDEED
2279-141140-0079 WAS TO CONDENSE IT INTO LARGER DROPS THEY HAD NOTHING TO EAT EXCEPTING WHAT THEY COULD CATCH SUCH AS OSTRICHES DEER
2279-141140-0080 AND THEIR ONLY FUEL WAS THE DRY STALKS OF A SMALL PLANT SOMEWHAT RESEMBLING AN ALOE THE SOLE LUXURY WHICH THESE MEN ENJOYED WAS SMOKING THE LITTLE PAPER CIGARS AND SUCKING MATE
2279-141140-0081 I USED TO THINK THAT THE CARRION VULTURES MAN'S CONSTANT ATTENDANTS ON THESE DREARY PLAINS WHILE SEATED ON THE LITTLE NEIGHBOURING CLIFFS SEEMED BY THEIR VERY PATIENCE TO SAY AH
2279-141140-0082 WHEN THE INDIANS COME WE SHALL HAVE A FEAST IN THE MORNING WE ALL SALLIED FORTH TO HUNT AND ALTHOUGH WE HAD NOT MUCH SUCCESS THERE WERE SOME ANIMATED CHASES SOON AFTER STARTING
2279-141140-0083 THE PARTY SEPARATED AND SO ARRANGED THEIR PLANS
2279-141140-0084 IN GUESSING WHICH THEY SHOW MUCH SKILL THEY SHOULD ALL MEET FROM DIFFERENT POINTS OF THE COMPASS ON A PLAIN PIECE OF GROUND
2279-141140-0085 AND THUS DRIVE TOGETHER THE WILD ANIMALS ONE DAY I WENT OUT HUNTING AT BAHIA BLANCA BUT THE MEN THERE MERELY RODE IN A CRESCENT EACH BEING ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE APART FROM THE OTHER
2279-141140-0086 A FINE MALE OSTRICH BEING TURNED BY THE HEADMOST RIDERS TRIED TO ESCAPE ON ONE SIDE THE GAUCHOS PURSUED AT A RECKLESS PACE TWISTING THEIR HORSES ABOUT WITH THE MOST ADMIRABLE COMMAND
2279-141140-0087 AND EACH MAN WHIRLING THE BALLS ROUND HIS HEAD AT LENGTH THE FOREMOST THREW THEM REVOLVING THROUGH THE AIR IN AN INSTANT THE OSTRICH ROLLED OVER AND OVER ITS LEGS FAIRLY LASHED TOGETHER BY THE THONG
2279-141140-0088 THEIR DESTROYER A SMALL AND PRETTY FOX WAS ALSO SINGULARLY NUMEROUS IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY WE COULD NOT HAVE SEEN LESS THAN FORTY OR FIFTY THEY WERE GENERALLY NEAR THEIR EARTHS
2279-141140-0089 BUT THE DOGS KILLED ONE WHEN WE RETURNED TO THE POSTA WE FOUND TWO OF THE PARTY RETURNED WHO HAD BEEN HUNTING BY THEMSELVES THEY HAD KILLED A PUMA AND HAD FOUND AN OSTRICH'S NEST WITH TWENTY SEVEN EGGS IN IT
2279-141140-0090 EACH OF THESE IS SAID TO EQUAL IN WEIGHT ELEVEN HEN'S EGGS
