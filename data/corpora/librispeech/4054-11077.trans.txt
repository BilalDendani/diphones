4054-11077-0000 WE WAKE UP SOME MORNING WITH NO IDEA THAT A GREAT HAPPINESS IS AT HAND AND BEFORE NIGHT IT HAS COME AND ALL THE WORLD IS CHANGED FOR US OR WE WAKE BRIGHT AND CHEERFUL WITH NEVER A GUESS THAT CLOUDS OF SORROW ARE LOWERING IN OUR SKY TO PUT ALL THE SUNSHINE OUT FOR A WHILE AND BEFORE NOON
4054-11077-0001 ALL IS DARK NOTHING WHISPERS OF EITHER THE JOY OR THE GRIEF NO INSTINCT BIDS US TO DELAY OR TO HASTEN THE OPENING OF THE LETTER OR TELEGRAM OR THE LIFTING OF THE LATCH OF THE DOOR AT WHICH STANDS THE MESSENGER OF GOOD OR ILL
4054-11077-0002 AND BECAUSE IT MAY BE AND OFTEN IS HAPPY TIDINGS THAT COME AND JOYFUL THINGS WHICH HAPPEN EACH FRESH DAY AS IT DAWNS UPON US IS LIKE AN UNREAD STORY FULL OF POSSIBLE INTEREST AND ADVENTURE
4054-11077-0003 TO BE MADE OURS AS SOON AS WE HAVE CUT THE PAGES AND BEGUN TO READ NOTHING WHISPERED TO KATY CARR AS SHE SAT AT THE WINDOW MENDING A LONG RENT IN JOHNNIE'S SCHOOL COAT AND SAW MISSUS ASHE COME IN AT THE SIDE GATE AND RING THE OFFICE BELL THAT THE VISIT HAD ANY SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR HER
4054-11077-0004 MISSUS ASHE OFTEN DID COME TO THE OFFICE TO CONSULT DOCTOR CARR AMY MIGHT NOT BE QUITE WELL KATY THOUGHT OR THERE MIGHT BE A LETTER WITH SOMETHING ABOUT WALTER IN IT OR PERHAPS MATTERS HAD GONE WRONG AT THE HOUSE WHERE PAPERERS AND PAINTERS WERE STILL AT WORK
4054-11077-0005 SO SHE WENT CALMLY ON WITH HER DARNING DRAWING THE RAVELLING WITH WHICH HER NEEDLE WAS THREADED CAREFULLY IN AND OUT AND TAKING NICE EVEN STITCHES WITHOUT ONE PROPHETIC THRILL OR TREMOR WHILE IF ONLY SHE COULD HAVE LOOKED THROUGH THE TWO WALLS
4054-11077-0006 AND TWO DOORS WHICH SEPARATED THE ROOM IN WHICH SHE SAT FROM THE OFFICE
4054-11077-0007 FOR MISSUS ASHE WAS ASKING PAPA TO LET HER DO THE VERY THING OF ALL OTHERS THAT SHE MOST LONGED TO DO
4054-11077-0008 I FEEL AS IF A CHANGE WOULD DO ME GOOD DON'T YOU THINK SO YOURSELF YES I DO DOCTOR CARR ADMITTED
4054-11077-0009 BUT IF YOU WILL LET ME HAVE KATY DOCTOR CARR IT WILL SETTLE ALL MY DIFFICULTIES
4054-11077-0010 ABOUT A YEAR I THINK MY PLANS ARE RATHER VAGUE AS YET BUT MY IDEA WAS TO SPEND A FEW WEEKS IN SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND FIRST I HAVE SOME COUSINS IN LONDON WHO WILL BE GOOD TO US AND AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE MARRIED A GENTLEMAN WHO LIVES ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT PERHAPS WE MIGHT GO THERE
4054-11077-0011 THEN WE COULD CROSS OVER TO FRANCE AND VISIT PARIS AND A FEW OTHER PLACES AND BEFORE IT GETS COLD GO DOWN TO NICE AND FROM THERE TO ITALY KATY WOULD LIKE TO SEE ITALY DON'T YOU THINK SO I DARE SAY SHE WOULD SAID DOCTOR CARR WITH A SMILE SHE WOULD BE A QUEER GIRL IF SHE DIDN'T
4054-11077-0012 IS ONE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN SQUADRON THEY WILL BE IN NAPLES BY AND BY AND IF WE WERE THERE AT THE SAME TIME WE SHOULD HAVE NED TO GO ABOUT WITH AND HE WOULD TAKE US TO THE RECEPTIONS ON THE FRIGATE AND ALL THAT WHICH WOULD BE A NICE CHANCE FOR KATY
4054-11077-0013 THEN TOWARD SPRING I SHOULD LIKE TO GO TO FLORENCE AND VENICE AND VISIT THE ITALIAN LAKES AND SWITZERLAND IN THE EARLY SUMMER BUT ALL THIS DEPENDS ON YOUR LETTING KATY GO IF YOU DECIDE AGAINST IT I SHALL GIVE THE WHOLE THING UP
4054-11077-0014 COAXINGLY YOU WILL BE KINDER THAN THAT I WILL TAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE CARE OF HER AND DO ALL I CAN TO MAKE HER HAPPY IF ONLY YOU WILL CONSENT TO LEND HER TO ME AND I SHALL CONSIDER IT SUCH A FAVOR AND IT IS TO COST YOU NOTHING YOU UNDERSTAND DOCTOR SHE IS TO BE MY GUEST ALL THROUGH
4054-11077-0015 NOW DOCTOR CARR PLEASE PLEASE I AM SURE YOU WON'T DENY ME WHEN I HAVE SO SET MY HEART UPON HAVING HER MISSUS ASHE WAS VERY PRETTY AND PERSUASIVE BUT STILL DOCTOR CARR HESITATED
4054-11077-0016 IT SEEMED EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO LET HER GO AT MISSUS ASHE'S EXPENSE AT THE SAME TIME THE CHANCE WAS SUCH A GOOD ONE AND MISSUS ASHE SO MUCH IN EARNEST AND SO URGENT THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO REFUSE POINT BLANK HE FINALLY CONSENTED TO TAKE TIME FOR CONSIDERATION BEFORE MAKING HIS DECISION
4054-11077-0017 I WILL TALK IT OVER WITH KATY HE SAID THE CHILD OUGHT TO HAVE A SAY IN THE MATTER AND WHATEVER WE DECIDE YOU MUST LET ME THANK YOU IN HER NAME AS WELL AS MY OWN FOR YOUR GREAT KINDNESS IN PROPOSING IT
4054-11077-0018 DOCTOR I'M NOT KIND AT ALL AND I DON'T WANT TO BE THANKED MY DESIRE TO TAKE KATY WITH ME TO EUROPE IS PURELY SELFISH I AM A LONELY PERSON SHE WENT ON I HAVE NO MOTHER OR SISTER AND NO COUSINS OF MY OWN AGE MY BROTHER'S PROFESSION KEEPS HIM AT SEA I SCARCELY EVER SEE HIM
4054-11077-0019 I HAVE NO ONE BUT A COUPLE OF OLD AUNTS TOO FEEBLE IN HEALTH TO TRAVEL WITH ME OR TO BE COUNTED ON IN CASE OF ANY EMERGENCY YOU SEE I AM A REAL CASE FOR PITY MISSUS ASHE SPOKE GAYLY BUT HER BROWN EYES WERE DIM WITH TEARS AS SHE ENDED HER LITTLE APPEAL
4054-11077-0020 DOCTOR CARR WHO WAS SOFT HEARTED WHERE WOMEN WERE CONCERNED WAS TOUCHED PERHAPS HIS FACE SHOWED IT FOR MISSUS ASHE ADDED IN A MORE HOPEFUL TONE BUT I WON'T TEASE ANY MORE I KNOW YOU WILL NOT REFUSE ME UNLESS YOU THINK IT RIGHT AND NECESSARY AND SHE CONTINUED MISCHIEVOUSLY
4054-11077-0021 I HAVE GREAT FAITH IN KATY AS AN ALLY I AM PRETTY SURE THAT SHE WILL SAY THAT SHE WANTS TO GO AND INDEED KATY'S CRY OF DELIGHT WHEN THE PLAN WAS PROPOSED TO HER SAID THAT SUFFICIENTLY WITHOUT NEED OF FURTHER EXPLANATION
4054-11077-0022 TO GO TO EUROPE FOR A YEAR WITH MISSUS ASHE AND AMY SEEMED SIMPLY TOO DELIGHTFUL TO BE TRUE
4054-11077-0023 DOCTOR CARR'S OBJECTIONS HIS RELUCTANCE TO PART WITH HER MELTED BEFORE THE RADIANCE OF HER SATISFACTION HE HAD NO IDEA THAT KATY WOULD CARE SO MUCH ABOUT IT AFTER ALL IT WAS A GREAT CHANCE PERHAPS THE ONLY ONE OF THE SORT THAT SHE WOULD EVER HAVE MISSUS ASHE COULD WELL AFFORD TO GIVE KATY THIS TREAT HE KNEW
4054-11077-0024 THAT IT WAS A FAVOR TO HER AS WELL AS TO KATY THIS TRAIN OF REASONING LED TO ITS NATURAL RESULTS DOCTOR CARR BEGAN TO WAVER IN HIS MIND BUT THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OVER KATY'S SECOND THOUGHTS WERE MORE SOBER ONES HOW COULD PAPA MANAGE WITHOUT HER FOR A WHOLE YEAR SHE ASKED HERSELF
4054-11077-0025 HE WOULD MISS HER SHE WELL KNEW AND MIGHT NOT THE CHARGE OF THE HOUSE BE TOO MUCH FOR CLOVER THE PRESERVES WERE ALMOST ALL MADE THAT WAS ONE COMFORT BUT THERE WERE THE WINTER CLOTHES TO BE SEEN TO
4054-11077-0026 WHICH HAD BEEN SO BRIGHT A FEW MINUTES BEFORE STRANGE TO SAY IT WAS THAT LITTLE PUCKER AND THE LOOK OF WORRY WHICH DECIDED DOCTOR CARR
4054-11077-0027 SHE IS ONLY TWENTY ONE HE REFLECTED HARDLY OUT OF CHILDHOOD I DON'T WANT HER TO SETTLE INTO AN ANXIOUS DRUDGING STATE AND LOSE HER YOUTH WITH CARING FOR US ALL SHE SHALL GO THOUGH HOW WE ARE TO MANAGE WITHOUT HER I DON'T SEE
4054-11077-0028 LITTLE CLOVER CAME GALLANTLY TO THE FORE WHEN THE FIRST SHOCK OF SURPRISE WAS OVER AND SHE HAD RELIEVED HER MIND WITH ONE LONG PRIVATE CRY OVER HAVING TO DO WITHOUT KATY FOR A YEAR THEN SHE WIPED HER EYES AND BEGAN TO REVEL UNSELFISHLY IN THE IDEA OF HER SISTER'S HAVING SO GREAT A TREAT
4054-11077-0029 ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING SEEMED POSSIBLE TO SECURE IT FOR HER AND SHE MADE LIGHT OF ALL KATY'S MANY ANXIETIES AND APPREHENSIONS MY DEAR CHILD I KNOW A FLANNEL UNDERSHIRT WHEN I SEE ONE JUST AS WELL AS YOU DO SHE DECLARED TUCKS IN JOHNNIE'S DRESS FORSOOTH WHY OF COURSE
4054-11077-0030 RIPPING OUT A TUCK DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY SUPERHUMAN INGENUITY GIVE ME YOUR SCISSORS AND I'LL SHOW YOU AT ONCE QUINCE MARMALADE DEBBY CAN MAKE THAT HERS IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS YOURS AND IF IT WASN'T WHAT SHOULD WE CARE AS LONG AS YOU ARE ASCENDING MONT BLANC
4054-11077-0031 AND HOB NOBBING WITH MICHAEL ANGELO AND THE CROWNED HEADS OF EUROPE I'LL MAKE THE SPICED PEACHES
4054-11077-0032 DON'T WORRY ABOUT US WE SHALL GET ON HAPPILY AND EASILY IN FACT I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF I DEVELOPED SUCH A TURN FOR HOUSEKEEPING THAT WHEN YOU COME BACK THE FAMILY REFUSED TO CHANGE
4054-11077-0033 WOULDN'T THAT BE FINE AND CLOVER LAUGHED MERRILY SO KATY DARLING CAST THAT SHADOW FROM YOUR BROW AND LOOK AS A GIRL OUGHT TO LOOK WHO'S GOING TO EUROPE WHY IF IT WERE I WHO WERE GOING I SHOULD SIMPLY STAND ON MY HEAD EVERY MOMENT OF THE TIME NOT A VERY CONVENIENT POSITION FOR PACKING SAID KATY SMILING
4054-11077-0034 I LOVE MISSUS ASHE FOR INVITING YOU SO DO I SAID KATY SOBERLY IT WAS THE KINDEST THING I CAN'T THINK WHY SHE DID IT
4054-11077-0035 AND THE NICEST TO HAVE ABOUT YOU NEEDN'T SAY YOU'RE NOT FOR YOU ARE NOW KATY DON'T WASTE ANOTHER THOUGHT ON SUCH MISERABLE THINGS AS PICKLES AND UNDERSHIRTS WE SHALL GET ALONG PERFECTLY WELL I DO ASSURE YOU JUST FIX YOUR MIND INSTEAD ON THE DOME OF SAINT PETER'S
4054-11077-0036 OR TRY TO FANCY HOW YOU'LL FEEL THE FIRST TIME YOU STEP INTO A GONDOLA OR SEE THE MEDITERRANEAN THERE WILL BE A MOMENT I FEEL A FORTY HORSE POWER OF HOUSEKEEPING DEVELOPING WITHIN ME
4054-11077-0037 AND POLITICAL ECONOMY ALL COMBINED ONLY A GREAT DEAL MORE INTERESTING WE SHALL STICK OUT ALL OVER WITH KNOWLEDGE BEFORE YOU COME BACK AND THIS MAKES IT A PLAIN DUTY TO GO IF IT WERE ONLY FOR OUR SAKES WITH THESE ZEALOUS PROMISES KATY WAS FORCED TO BE CONTENT
4054-11077-0038 INDEED CONTENTMENT WAS NOT DIFFICULT WITH SUCH A PROSPECT OF DELIGHT BEFORE HER WHEN ONCE HER LITTLE ANXIETIES HAD BEEN LAID ASIDE THE IDEA OF THE COMING JOURNEY GREW IN PLEASANTNESS EVERY MOMENT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT SHE AND PAPA AND THE CHILDREN PORED OVER MAPS AND MADE OUT SCHEMES FOR TRAVEL AND SIGHT SEEING
4054-11077-0039 EVERY ONE OF WHICH WAS LIKELY TO BE DISCARDED AS SOON AS THE REAL JOURNEY BEGAN BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT AND IT MADE NO REAL DIFFERENCE SUCH SCHEMES ARE THE PRELIMINARY JOYS OF TRAVEL
4054-11077-0040 KATY LEARNED A GREAT DEAL WHILE THUS TALKING OVER WHAT SHE WAS TO SEE AND DO SHE READ EVERY SCRAP SHE COULD LAY HER HAND ON WHICH RELATED TO ROME OR FLORENCE OR VENICE OR LONDON THE DRIEST DETAILS HAD A CHARM FOR HER NOW THAT SHE WAS LIKELY TO SEE THE REAL PLACES
4054-11077-0041 SHE WENT ABOUT WITH SCRAPS OF PAPER IN HER POCKET ON WHICH WERE WRITTEN SUCH THINGS AS THESE FORUM WHEN BUILT BY WHOM BUILT MORE THAN ONE WHAT DOES CENACOLA MEAN
4054-11077-0042 FIND OUT ABOUT SAINT CATHERINE OF SIENA
4054-11077-0043 PEOPLE ALWAYS WISH THIS WHEN THEY ARE STARTING FOR EUROPE
4054-11077-0044 HOW THEY ADD TO THE CHARM OF EVERYTHING SEEN AND ENHANCE THE EASE OF EVERYTHING DONE ALL BURNET TOOK AN INTEREST IN KATY'S PLANS AND ALMOST EVERYBODY HAD SOME SORT OF ADVICE OR HELP OR SOME LITTLE GIFT TO OFFER OLD MISSUS WORRETT WHO THOUGH FATTER THAN EVER STILL RETAINED THE POWER OF LOCOMOTION
4054-11077-0045 DROVE IN FROM CONIC SECTION IN HER ROOMY CARRYALL WITH THE PRESENT OF A RATHER OBSOLETE COPY OF MURRAY'S GUIDE IN FADED RED COVERS WHICH HER FATHER HAD USED IN HIS YOUTH AND WHICH SHE WAS SURE KATY WOULD FIND CONVENIENT ALSO A BOTTLE OF BROWN'S JAMAICA GINGER IN CASE OF SEA SICKNESS
4054-11077-0046 CECY SENT A WONDERFUL OLD GOLD AND SCARLET CONTRIVANCE TO HANG ON THE WALL OF THE STATEROOM THERE WERE POCKETS FOR WATCHES AND POCKETS FOR MEDICINES AND POCKETS FOR HANDKERCHIEF AND HAIRPINS IN SHORT THERE WERE POCKETS FOR EVERYTHING
4054-11077-0047 A CAKE OF SOAP AND A HAMMER AND TACKS TO NAIL THE WHOLE UP WITH MISSUS HALL'S GIFT WAS A WARM AND VERY PRETTY WOOLLEN WRAPPER OF DARK BLUE FLANNEL WITH A PAIR OF SOFT KNITTED SLIPPERS TO MATCH
4054-11077-0048 OLD MISTER WORRETT SENT A NOTE OF ADVICE RECOMMENDING KATY TO TAKE A QUININE PILL EVERY DAY THAT SHE WAS AWAY NEVER TO STAY OUT LATE BECAUSE THE DEWS OVER THERE WERE SAID TO BE UNWHOLESOME AND ON NO ACCOUNT TO DRINK A DROP OF WATER WHICH HAD NOT BEEN BOILED
4054-11077-0049 FROM COUSIN HELEN CAME A DELIGHTFUL TRAVELLING BAG LIGHT AND STRONG AT ONCE AND FITTED UP WITH ALL MANNER OF NICE LITTLE CONVENIENCES MISS INCHES SENT A HISTORY OF EUROPE IN FIVE FAT VOLUMES WHICH WAS SO HEAVY THAT IT HAD TO BE LEFT AT HOME
4054-11077-0050 IN FACT A GOOD MANY OF KATY'S PRESENTS HAD TO BE LEFT AT HOME INCLUDING A BRONZE PAPER WEIGHT IN THE SHAPE OF A GRIFFIN A LARGE PAIR OF BRASS SCREW CANDLESTICKS AND AN ORMOLU INKSTAND WITH A PEN REST ATTACHED WHICH WEIGHED AT LEAST A POUND AND A HALF THESE KATY LAID ASIDE TO ENJOY AFTER HER RETURN
4054-11077-0051 MISSUS ASHE AND COUSIN HELEN HAD BOTH WARNED HER OF THE INCONVENIENT CONSEQUENCES OF WEIGHT IN BAGGAGE AND BY THEIR ADVICE SHE HAD LIMITED HERSELF TO A SINGLE TRUNK OF MODERATE SIZE BESIDES A LITTLE FLAT VALISE FOR USE IN HER STATEROOM CLOVER'S GIFT WAS A SET OF BLANK BOOKS FOR NOTES
4054-11077-0052 JOURNALS ET CETERA IN ONE OF THESE KATY MADE OUT A LIST OF THINGS I MUST SEE THINGS I MUST DO THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO DO ANOTHER SHE DEVOTED TO VARIOUS GOOD SHOPPING ADDRESSES WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN HER
4054-11077-0053 TO STAND IN FRONT OF SHOP WINDOWS FULL OF DELIGHTFUL THINGS AND NOT BE ABLE TO BUY ANY OF THEM SHE WAS ACCORDINGLY OVERPOWERED WITH SURPRISE GRATITUDE AND THE SENSE OF SUDDEN WEALTH WHEN ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE THE START HER FATHER GAVE HER THREE LITTLE THIN STRIPS OF PAPER WHICH HE TOLD HER WERE CIRCULAR NOTES
4054-11077-0054 AND WORTH A HUNDRED DOLLARS APIECE HE ALSO GAVE HER FIVE ENGLISH SOVEREIGNS THOSE ARE FOR IMMEDIATE USE HE SAID PUT THE NOTES AWAY CAREFULLY AND DON'T LOSE THEM
4054-11077-0055 AND THERE WILL BE FEES BUT PAPA PROTESTED KATY OPENING WIDE HER CANDID EYES I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO GIVE ME ANY MONEY AND I'M AFRAID YOU ARE GIVING ME TOO MUCH
4054-11077-0056 HER FATHER ONLY LAUGHED
4054-11077-0057 PAPA I SHOULD THINK NOT CRIED KATY WITH UNSOPHISTICATED HORROR ONE VERY INTERESTING THING WAS TO HAPPEN BEFORE THEY SAILED THE THOUGHT OF WHICH HELPED BOTH KATY AND CLOVER THROUGH THE LAST HARD DAYS WHEN THE PREPARATIONS WERE NEARLY COMPLETE AND THE FAMILY HAD LEISURE TO FEEL DULL AND OUT OF SPIRITS
4054-11077-0058 KATY WAS TO MAKE ROSE RED A VISIT ROSE HAD BY NO MEANS BEEN IDLE DURING THE THREE YEARS AND A HALF WHICH HAD ELAPSED SINCE THEY ALL PARTED AT HILLSOVER AND DURING WHICH THE GIRLS HAD NOT SEEN HER
4054-11077-0059 IN FACT SHE HAD MADE MORE OUT OF THE TIME THAN ANY OF THE REST OF THEM FOR SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS HAD BEEN MARRIED AND WAS NOW KEEPING HOUSE NEAR BOSTON WITH A LITTLE ROSE OF HER OWN WHO SHE WROTE TO CLOVER WAS A PERFECT ANGEL AND MORE DELICIOUS THAN WORDS COULD SAY
4054-11077-0060 WHILE MISSUS ASHE AND AMY VISITED AN OLD AUNT IN HINGHAM TO SEE ROSE IN HER OWN HOME AND ROSE'S HUSBAND AND ROSE'S BABY WAS ONLY NEXT IN INTEREST TO SEEING EUROPE
4054-11077-0061 LONGWOOD SEPTEMBER TWENTIETH MY DEAREST CHILD YOUR NOTE MADE ME DANCE WITH DELIGHT
4054-11077-0062 IT IS TOO ENCHANTING THE WHOLE OF IT I PUT IT AT THE HEAD OF ALL THE NICE THINGS THAT EVER HAPPENED EXCEPT MY BABY WRITE THE MOMENT YOU GET THIS BY WHAT TRAIN YOU EXPECT TO REACH BOSTON AND WHEN YOU ROLL INTO THE STATION YOU WILL BEHOLD TWO FORMS ONE TALL AND STALWART THE OTHER SHORT AND FATSOME WAITING FOR YOU
4054-11077-0063 THEY WILL BE THOSE OF DENISTON AND MYSELF DENISTON IS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT HE IS GOOD AND HE IS PREPARED TO ADORE YOU THE BABY IS BOTH GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL AND YOU WILL ADORE HER I AM NEITHER BUT YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT ME AND I ALWAYS DID ADORE YOU AND ALWAYS SHALL
4054-11077-0064 I AM GOING OUT THIS MOMENT TO THE BUTCHER'S TO ORDER A CALF FATTED FOR YOUR SPECIAL BEHOOF AND HE SHALL BE SLAIN AND MADE INTO CUTLETS THE MOMENT I HEAR FROM YOU
4054-11077-0065 IS SOMEWHAT QUEER AS YOU MIGHT KNOW MY HOUSE WOULD BE BUT I THINK YOU WILL LIKE IT I SAW SILVERY MARY THE OTHER DAY AND TOLD HER YOU WERE COMING SHE IS THE SAME MOUSE AS EVER I SHALL ASK HER AND SOME OF THE OTHER GIRLS TO COME OUT TO LUNCH ON ONE OF YOUR DAYS
4054-11077-0066 GOOD BY WITH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY KISSES TO CLOVY AND THE REST YOUR LOVING ROSE RED SHE NEVER SIGNS HERSELF BROWNE I OBSERVE SAID CLOVER AS SHE FINISHED THE LETTER OH ROSE RED BROWNE WOULD SOUND TOO FUNNY ROSE RED SHE MUST STAY TILL THE END OF THE CHAPTER
4054-11077-0067 NO OTHER NAME COULD SUIT HER HALF SO WELL AND I CAN'T IMAGINE HER BEING CALLED ANYTHING ELSE WHAT FUN IT WILL BE TO SEE HER AND LITTLE ROSE AND DENISTON BROWNE PUT IN CLOVER SOMEHOW I FIND IT RATHER HARD TO TAKE IN THE FACT THAT THERE IS A DENISTON BROWNE OBSERVED KATY
4054-11077-0068 THE LAST DAY CAME AS LAST DAYS WILL
4054-11077-0069 HE NOW PROCEEDED TO PREPARE AND PASTE ON TWO SQUARE CARDS LABELLED RESPECTIVELY HOLD AND STATE ROOM MISSUS HALL HAD TOLD THEM THAT THIS WAS THE CORRECT THING TO DO
4054-11077-0070 AND KATY AND CLOVER HAD TAKEN A GOOD MANY HOURS FROM THEIR OWN PREPARATIONS TO HELP HER
4054-11077-0071 SHE STOOD SO VERY STILL AND SAID SO VERY LITTLE THAT A BYSTANDER NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT HAVE DUBBED HER UNFEELING WHILE THE FACT WAS THAT SHE WAS FEELING TOO MUCH
4054-11077-0072 THE FIRST BELL RANG KATY KISSED EVERYBODY QUIETLY AND WENT ON BOARD WITH HER FATHER HER PARTING FROM HIM HARDEST OF ALL TOOK PLACE IN THE MIDST OF A CROWD OF PEOPLE THEN HE HAD TO LEAVE HER AND AS THE WHEELS BEGAN TO REVOLVE SHE WENT OUT ON THE SIDE DECK TO HAVE A LAST GLIMPSE OF THE HOME FACES
4054-11077-0073 THERE THEY WERE ELSIE CRYING TUMULTUOUSLY WITH HER HEAD ON PAPA'S COAT SLEEVE JOHN LAUGHING OR TRYING TO LAUGH WITH BIG TEARS RUNNING DOWN HER CHEEKS THE WHILE AND BRAVE LITTLE CLOVER WAVING HER HANDKERCHIEF ENCOURAGINGLY BUT WITH A VERY SOBER LOOK ON HER FACE
4054-11077-0074 WHY HAD SHE SAID SHE WOULD GO WHAT WAS ALL EUROPE IN COMPARISON WITH WHAT SHE WAS LEAVING LIFE WAS SO SHORT HOW COULD SHE TAKE A WHOLE YEAR OUT OF IT TO SPEND AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE SHE LOVED BEST
4054-11077-0075 I ALSO THINK SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARTILY SORRY A LITTLE LATER HAD SHE DONE SO
4054-11077-0076 GRADUALLY THE DEAR FACES FADED INTO DISTANCE AND AFTER WATCHING TILL THE FLUTTER OF CLOVER'S HANDKERCHIEF BECAME AN UNDISTINGUISHABLE SPECK KATY WENT TO THE CABIN WITH A HEAVY HEART
4054-11077-0077 BUT THERE WERE MISSUS ASHE AND AMY INCLINED TO BE HOMESICK ALSO AND IN NEED OF CHEERING AND KATY AS SHE TRIED TO BRIGHTEN THEM GRADUALLY GREW BRIGHT HERSELF AND RECOVERED HER HOPEFUL SPIRITS BURNET PULLED LESS STRONGLY AS IT GOT FARTHER AWAY
4054-11077-0078 AND EUROPE BECKONED MORE BRILLIANTLY NOW THAT THEY WERE FAIRLY EMBARKED ON THEIR JOURNEY
