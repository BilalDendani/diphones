6610-65818-0000 MOSTLY BEECH AND DECENT MANSIONS THERE APPEARED TO BE A GREAT QUANTITY OF CORN LAND AND THE SOIL LOOKED MUCH MORE FERTILE THAN IT IS IN GENERAL SO NEAR THE SEA THE RISING GROUNDS INDEED WERE VERY FEW
6610-65818-0001 AND AROUND COPENHAGEN IT IS A PERFECT PLAIN OF COURSE HAS NOTHING TO RECOMMEND IT BUT CULTIVATION NOT DECORATIONS IF I SAY THAT THE HOUSES DID NOT DISGUST ME I TELL YOU ALL I REMEMBER OF THEM
6610-65818-0002 BUT WITHOUT ANY STRIKING FEATURE TO INTEREST THE IMAGINATION
6610-65818-0003 JUST BEFORE I REACHED COPENHAGEN I SAW A NUMBER OF TENTS ON A WIDE PLAIN AND SUPPOSED THAT THE RAGE FOR ENCAMPMENTS HAD REACHED THIS CITY
6610-65818-0004 BUT I SOON DISCOVERED THAT THEY WERE THE ASYLUM OF MANY OF THE POOR FAMILIES WHO HAD BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF THEIR HABITATIONS BY THE LATE FIRE ENTERING SOON AFTER I PASSED AMONGST THE DUST AND RUBBISH IT HAD LEFT
6610-65818-0005 AFFRIGHTED BY VIEWING THE EXTENT OF THE DEVASTATION FOR AT LEAST A QUARTER OF THE CITY HAD BEEN DESTROYED THERE WAS LITTLE IN THE APPEARANCE OF FALLEN BRICKS AND STACKS OF CHIMNEYS
6610-65818-0006 NOTHING TO ATTRACT THE EYE OF TASTE BUT MUCH TO AFFLICT THE BENEVOLENT HEART THE DEPREDATIONS OF TIME HAVE ALWAYS SOMETHING IN THEM TO EMPLOY THE FANCY OR LEAD TO MUSING ON SUBJECTS WHICH WITHDRAWING THE MIND FROM OBJECTS OF SENSE
6610-65818-0007 SEEM TO GIVE IT NEW DIGNITY BUT HERE I WAS TREADING ON LIVE ASHES THE SUFFERERS WERE STILL UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THE MISERY OCCASIONED BY THIS DREADFUL CONFLAGRATION I COULD NOT TAKE REFUGE IN THE THOUGHT
6610-65818-0008 THEY SUFFERED BUT THEY ARE NO MORE A REFLECTION I FREQUENTLY SUMMON TO CALM MY MIND WHEN SYMPATHY RISES TO ANGUISH I THEREFORE DESIRED THE DRIVER TO HASTEN TO THE HOTEL RECOMMENDED TO ME
6610-65818-0009 THAT I MIGHT AVERT MY EYES AND SNAP THE TRAIN OF THINKING WHICH HAD SENT ME INTO ALL THE CORNERS OF THE CITY IN SEARCH OF HOUSELESS HEADS THIS MORNING I HAVE BEEN WALKING ROUND THE TOWN
6610-65818-0010 CERTAINLY I HAVE SEEN IT IN A VERY DISADVANTAGEOUS LIGHT
6610-65818-0011 STILL THE UTMOST THAT CAN OR COULD EVER I BELIEVE HAVE BEEN SAID IN ITS PRAISE MIGHT BE COMPRISED IN A FEW WORDS THE STREETS ARE OPEN AND MANY OF THE HOUSES LARGE BUT I SAW NOTHING TO ROUSE THE IDEA OF ELEGANCE OR GRANDEUR
6610-65818-0012 IF I EXCEPT THE CIRCUS WHERE THE KING AND PRINCE ROYAL RESIDE THE PALACE WHICH WAS CONSUMED ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO MUST HAVE BEEN A HANDSOME SPACIOUS BUILDING THE STONE WORK IS STILL STANDING AND A GREAT NUMBER OF THE POOR
6610-65818-0013 DURING THE LATE FIRE TOOK REFUGE IN ITS RUINS TILL THEY COULD FIND SOME OTHER ABODE BEDS WERE THROWN ON THE LANDING PLACES OF THE GRAND STAIRCASE WHERE WHOLE FAMILIES CREPT FROM THE COLD
6610-65818-0014 DEPRIVED OF THEIR HOME AT PRESENT A ROOF MAY BE SUFFICIENT TO SHELTER THEM FROM THE NIGHT AIR BUT AS THE SEASON ADVANCES THE EXTENT OF THE CALAMITY WILL BE MORE SEVERELY FELT I FEAR THOUGH THE EXERTIONS ON THE PART OF GOVERNMENT ARE VERY CONSIDERABLE
6610-65818-0015 PRIVATE CHARITY HAS ALSO NO DOUBT DONE MUCH TO ALLEVIATE THE MISERY WHICH OBTRUDES ITSELF AT EVERY TURN STILL PUBLIC SPIRIT APPEARS TO ME TO BE HARDLY ALIVE HERE
6610-65818-0016 TO THIS THE INHABITANTS WOULD NOT CONSENT AND THE PRINCE ROYAL NOT HAVING SUFFICIENT ENERGY OF CHARACTER TO KNOW WHEN HE OUGHT TO BE ABSOLUTE CALMLY LET THEM PURSUE THEIR OWN COURSE TILL THE WHOLE CITY SEEMED TO BE THREATENED WITH DESTRUCTION ADHERING
6610-65818-0017 WITH PUERILE SCRUPULOSITY TO THE LAW WHICH HE HAS IMPOSED ON HIMSELF OF ACTING EXACTLY RIGHT HE DID WRONG
6610-65818-0018 WOULD HAVE STOPPED HE WAS AFTERWARDS OBLIGED TO RESORT TO VIOLENT MEASURES BUT THEN WHO COULD BLAME HIM AND TO AVOID CENSURE WHAT SACRIFICES ARE NOT MADE BY WEAK MINDS
6610-65818-0019 A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS A WITNESS OF THE SCENE ASSURED ME LIKEWISE
6610-65818-0020 IT WOULD SOON HAVE BEEN GOT UNDER BUT THEY WHO WERE NOT IMMEDIATELY IN DANGER DID NOT EXERT THEMSELVES SUFFICIENTLY TILL FEAR LIKE AN ELECTRICAL SHOCK
6610-65818-0021 EVEN THE FIRE ENGINES WERE OUT OF ORDER
6610-65818-0022 OF THE NECESSITY OF KEEPING THEM IN CONSTANT REPAIR BUT THIS KIND OF INDOLENCE RESPECTING WHAT DOES NOT IMMEDIATELY CONCERN THEM SEEMS TO CHARACTERISE THE DANES A SLUGGISH CONCENTRATION IN THEMSELVES MAKES THEM SO CAREFUL TO PRESERVE THEIR PROPERTY
6610-65818-0023 IN WHICH THERE IS A SHADOW OF HAZARD
6610-65818-0024 I WAS SURPRISED NOT TO SEE SO MUCH INDUSTRY OR TASTE AS IN CHRISTIANIA INDEED FROM EVERYTHING I HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVING
6610-65818-0025 THE MEN OF BUSINESS ARE DOMESTIC TYRANTS COLDLY IMMERSED IN THEIR OWN AFFAIRS AND SO IGNORANT OF THE STATE OF OTHER COUNTRIES THAT THEY DOGMATICALLY ASSERT THAT DENMARK IS THE HAPPIEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD
6610-65818-0026 THE PRINCE ROYAL THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE PRINCES AND COUNT BERNSTORFF THE WISEST OF MINISTERS AS FOR THE WOMEN THEY ARE SIMPLY NOTABLE HOUSEWIVES WITHOUT ACCOMPLISHMENTS OR ANY OF THE CHARMS THAT ADORN MORE ADVANCED SOCIAL LIFE
6610-65818-0027 THIS TOTAL IGNORANCE MAY ENABLE THEM TO SAVE SOMETHING IN THEIR KITCHENS BUT IT IS FAR FROM RENDERING THEM BETTER PARENTS ON THE CONTRARY THE CHILDREN ARE SPOILED AS THEY USUALLY ARE WHEN LEFT TO THE CARE OF WEAK INDULGENT MOTHERS
6610-65818-0028 BECOME THE SLAVES OF INFANTS ENFEEBLING BOTH BODY AND MIND BY FALSE TENDERNESS I AM PERHAPS A LITTLE PREJUDICED AS I WRITE FROM THE IMPRESSION OF THE MOMENT FOR I HAVE BEEN TORMENTED TO DAY BY THE PRESENCE OF UNRULY CHILDREN
6610-65818-0029 THOU HAST HAUNTED ME EVER SINCE MAY ARRIVAL AND THE VIEW I HAVE HAD OF THE MANNERS OF THE COUNTRY EXCITING MY SYMPATHY HAS INCREASED MY RESPECT FOR THY MEMORY I AM NOW FULLY CONVINCED THAT SHE WAS THE VICTIM OF THE PARTY SHE DISPLACED
6610-65818-0030 WHO WOULD HAVE OVERLOOKED OR ENCOURAGED HER ATTACHMENT HAD NOT HER LOVER
6610-65818-0031 RIPE FOR THE CHANGE HAD SUFFICIENT SPIRIT TO SUPPORT HIM WHEN STRUGGLING IN THEIR BEHALF SUCH INDEED WAS THE ASPERITY SHARPENED AGAINST HER
6610-65818-0032 EVEN AFTER SO MANY YEARS HAVE ELAPSED CHARGED WITH LICENTIOUSNESS NOT ONLY FOR ENDEAVOURING TO RENDER THE PUBLIC AMUSEMENTS MORE ELEGANT
6610-65818-0033 BECAUSE SHE ERECTED AMONGST OTHER INSTITUTIONS
6610-65818-0034 DISGUSTED WITH MANY CUSTOMS WHICH PASS FOR VIRTUES THOUGH THEY ARE NOTHING MORE THAN OBSERVANCES OF FORMS OFTEN AT THE EXPENSE OF TRUTH SHE PROBABLY RAN INTO AN ERROR COMMON TO INNOVATORS
6610-65818-0035 AS THE KING'S CONDUCT HAD ALWAYS BEEN DIRECTED BY SOME FAVOURITE THEY ALSO ENDEAVOURED TO GOVERN HIM FROM A PRINCIPLE OF SELF PRESERVATION AS WELL AS A LAUDABLE AMBITION BUT NOT AWARE OF THE PREJUDICES THEY HAD TO ENCOUNTER
6610-65818-0036 THEIR OPPRESSORS HAD BETTER HAVE ACCUSED THEM OF DABBLING IN THE BLACK ART FOR THE POTENT SPELL STILL KEEPS HIS WITS IN BONDAGE
6610-65818-0037 WHICH TO AVOID DANGER
6610-65818-0038 FOR HE IS ALLOWED TO BE ABSOLUTELY AIM IDIOT EXCEPTING THAT NOW AND THEN AN OBSERVATION OR TRICK ESCAPES HIM WHICH LOOKS MORE LIKE MADNESS THAN IMBECILITY WHAT A FARCE IS LIFE THIS EFFIGY OF MAJESTY
6610-65818-0039 IS ALLOWED TO BURN DOWN TO THE SOCKET WHILST THE HAPLESS MATILDA WAS HURRIED INTO AN UNTIMELY GRAVE AS FLIES TO WANTON BOYS ARE WE TO THE GODS
