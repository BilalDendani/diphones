1160-139727-0003 AND THEREFORE GENERALLY SUCCESSFUL IN ARGUMENTATIVE CONVERSATION HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP TO IT FROM A BOY HIS FATHER AS I HAVE HEARD ACCUSTOMING HIS CHILDREN TO DISPUTE WITH ONE ANOTHER FOR HIS DIVERSION
1160-139727-0004 FOR IN THE COURSE OF MY OBSERVATION THESE DISPUTING CONTRADICTING AND CONFUTING PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY UNFORTUNATE IN THEIR AFFAIRS THEY GET VICTORY SOMETIMES BUT THEY NEVER GET GOOD WILL
