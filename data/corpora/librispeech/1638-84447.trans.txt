1638-84447-0000 THE PHANTOM SLOWLY GRAVELY SILENTLY APPROACHED WHEN IT CAME NEAR HIM SCROOGE BENT DOWN UPON HIS KNEE FOR IN THE VERY AIR THROUGH WHICH THIS SPIRIT MOVED IT SEEMED TO SCATTER GLOOM AND MYSTERY
1638-84447-0001 IT WAS SHROUDED IN A DEEP BLACK GARMENT WHICH CONCEALED ITS HEAD ITS FACE ITS FORM AND LEFT NOTHING OF IT VISIBLE SAVE ONE OUTSTRETCHED HAND BUT FOR THIS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO DETACH ITS FIGURE FROM THE NIGHT
1638-84447-0002 AND SEPARATE IT FROM THE DARKNESS BY WHICH IT WAS SURROUNDED HE FELT THAT IT WAS TALL AND STATELY WHEN IT CAME BESIDE HIM AND THAT ITS MYSTERIOUS PRESENCE FILLED HIM WITH A SOLEMN DREAD HE KNEW NO MORE
1638-84447-0003 FOR THE SPIRIT NEITHER SPOKE NOR MOVED I AM IN THE PRESENCE OF THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS YET TO COME SAID SCROOGE THE SPIRIT ANSWERED NOT BUT POINTED ONWARD WITH ITS HAND
1638-84447-0004 YOU ARE ABOUT TO SHOW ME SHADOWS OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE NOT HAPPENED BUT WILL HAPPEN IN THE TIME BEFORE US SCROOGE PURSUED IS THAT SO SPIRIT THE UPPER PORTION OF THE GARMENT WAS CONTRACTED FOR AN INSTANT IN ITS FOLDS
1638-84447-0005 AS IF THE SPIRIT HAD INCLINED ITS HEAD THAT WAS THE ONLY ANSWER HE RECEIVED ALTHOUGH WELL USED TO GHOSTLY COMPANY BY THIS TIME SCROOGE FEARED THE SILENT SHAPE SO MUCH THAT HIS LEGS TREMBLED BENEATH HIM
1638-84447-0006 AND HE FOUND THAT HE COULD HARDLY STAND WHEN HE PREPARED TO FOLLOW IT THE SPIRIT PAUSED A MOMENT AS OBSERVING HIS CONDITION AND GIVING HIM TIME TO RECOVER BUT SCROOGE WAS ALL THE WORSE FOR THIS IT THRILLED HIM WITH A VAGUE UNCERTAIN HORROR
1638-84447-0007 TO KNOW THAT BEHIND THE DUSKY SHROUD THERE WERE GHOSTLY EYES INTENTLY FIXED UPON HIM WHILE HE THOUGH HE STRETCHED HIS OWN TO THE UTMOST COULD SEE NOTHING BUT A SPECTRAL HAND AND ONE GREAT HEAP OF BLACK
1638-84447-0008 GHOST OF THE FUTURE HE EXCLAIMED I FEAR YOU MORE THAN ANY SPECTRE I HAVE SEEN BUT AS I KNOW YOUR PURPOSE IS TO DO ME GOOD AND AS I HOPE TO LIVE TO BE ANOTHER MAN FROM WHAT I WAS
1638-84447-0009 WILL YOU NOT SPEAK TO ME IT GAVE HIM NO REPLY THE HAND WAS POINTED STRAIGHT BEFORE THEM LEAD ON SAID SCROOGE LEAD ON THE NIGHT IS WANING FAST AND IT IS PRECIOUS TIME TO ME I KNOW
1638-84447-0010 LEAD ON SPIRIT THE PHANTOM MOVED AWAY AS IT HAD COME TOWARDS HIM SCROOGE FOLLOWED IN THE SHADOW OF ITS DRESS WHICH BORE HIM UP HE THOUGHT AND CARRIED HIM ALONG
1638-84447-0011 THEY SCARCELY SEEMED TO ENTER THE CITY FOR THE CITY RATHER SEEMED TO SPRING UP ABOUT THEM AND ENCOMPASS THEM OF ITS OWN ACT BUT THERE THEY WERE IN THE HEART OF IT ON CHANGE AMONGST THE MERCHANTS WHO HURRIED UP AND DOWN
1638-84447-0012 AND CHINKED THE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS AND CONVERSED IN GROUPS AND LOOKED AT THEIR WATCHES AND TRIFLED THOUGHTFULLY WITH THEIR GREAT GOLD SEALS AND SO FORTH AS SCROOGE HAD SEEN THEM OFTEN
1638-84447-0013 THE SPIRIT STOPPED BESIDE ONE LITTLE KNOT OF BUSINESS MEN OBSERVING THAT THE HAND WAS POINTED TO THEM SCROOGE ADVANCED TO LISTEN TO THEIR TALK
1638-84447-0014 I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT EITHER WAY I ONLY KNOW HE'S DEAD WHEN DID HE DIE INQUIRED ANOTHER LAST NIGHT I BELIEVE WHY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM
1638-84447-0015 ASKED A THIRD TAKING A VAST QUANTITY OF SNUFF OUT OF A VERY LARGE SNUFF BOX I THOUGHT HE'D NEVER DIE
1638-84447-0016 SAID THE FIRST WITH A YAWN WHAT HAS HE DONE WITH HIS MONEY ASKED A RED FACED GENTLEMAN WITH A PENDULOUS EXCRESCENCE ON THE END OF HIS NOSE THAT SHOOK LIKE THE GILLS OF A TURKEY COCK
1638-84447-0017 LEFT IT TO HIS COMPANY PERHAPS HE HASN'T LEFT IT TO ME THAT'S ALL I KNOW THIS PLEASANTRY WAS RECEIVED WITH A GENERAL LAUGH IT'S LIKELY TO BE A VERY CHEAP FUNERAL SAID THE SAME SPEAKER
1638-84447-0018 FOR UPON MY LIFE I DON'T KNOW OF ANYBODY TO GO TO IT SUPPOSE WE MAKE UP A PARTY AND VOLUNTEER I DON'T MIND GOING IF A LUNCH IS PROVIDED OBSERVED THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE EXCRESCENCE ON HIS NOSE
1638-84447-0019 BUT I MUST BE FED IF I MAKE ONE ANOTHER LAUGH WELL I AM THE MOST DISINTERESTED AMONG YOU AFTER ALL SAID THE FIRST SPEAKER
1638-84447-0020 BUT I'LL OFFER TO GO IF ANYBODY ELSE WILL WHEN I COME TO THINK OF IT I'M NOT AT ALL SURE THAT I WASN'T HIS MOST PARTICULAR FRIEND FOR WE USED TO STOP AND SPEAK WHENEVER WE MET BYE BYE
1638-84447-0021 SPEAKERS AND LISTENERS STROLLED AWAY AND MIXED WITH OTHER GROUPS SCROOGE KNEW THE MEN AND LOOKED TOWARDS THE SPIRIT FOR AN EXPLANATION THE PHANTOM GLIDED ON INTO A STREET ITS FINGER POINTED TO TWO PERSONS MEETING
1638-84447-0022 SCROOGE LISTENED AGAIN THINKING THAT THE EXPLANATION MIGHT LIE HERE HE KNEW THESE MEN ALSO PERFECTLY THEY WERE MEN OF BUSINESS VERY WEALTHY AND OF GREAT IMPORTANCE
1638-84447-0023 HE HAD MADE A POINT ALWAYS OF STANDING WELL IN THEIR ESTEEM IN A BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW THAT IS STRICTLY IN A BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW HOW ARE YOU SAID ONE HOW ARE YOU RETURNED THE OTHER WELL SAID THE FIRST
1638-84447-0024 SO I AM TOLD RETURNED THE SECOND COLD ISN'T IT SEASONABLE FOR CHRISTMAS TIME YOU'RE NOT A SKATER I SUPPOSE NO NO SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK OF GOOD MORNING NOT ANOTHER WORD THAT WAS THEIR MEETING THEIR CONVERSATION AND THEIR PARTING
1638-84447-0025 SCROOGE WAS AT FIRST INCLINED TO BE SURPRISED THAT THE SPIRIT SHOULD ATTACH IMPORTANCE TO CONVERSATIONS APPARENTLY SO TRIVIAL BUT FEELING ASSURED THAT THEY MUST HAVE SOME HIDDEN PURPOSE HE SET HIMSELF TO CONSIDER WHAT IT WAS LIKELY TO BE
1638-84447-0026 THEY COULD SCARCELY BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE ANY BEARING ON THE DEATH OF JACOB HIS OLD PARTNER FOR THAT WAS PAST AND THIS GHOST'S PROVINCE WAS THE FUTURE NOR COULD HE THINK OF ANY ONE IMMEDIATELY CONNECTED WITH HIMSELF TO WHOM HE COULD APPLY THEM
1638-84447-0027 BUT NOTHING DOUBTING THAT TO WHOMSOEVER THEY APPLIED THEY HAD SOME LATENT MORAL FOR HIS OWN IMPROVEMENT HE RESOLVED TO TREASURE UP EVERY WORD HE HEARD AND EVERYTHING HE SAW AND ESPECIALLY TO OBSERVE THE SHADOW OF HIMSELF WHEN IT APPEARED
1638-84447-0028 FOR HE HAD AN EXPECTATION THAT THE CONDUCT OF HIS FUTURE SELF WOULD GIVE HIM THE CLUE HE MISSED AND WOULD RENDER THE SOLUTION OF THESE RIDDLES EASY HE LOOKED ABOUT IN THAT VERY PLACE FOR HIS OWN IMAGE BUT ANOTHER MAN STOOD IN HIS ACCUSTOMED CORNER
1638-84447-0029 AND THOUGH THE CLOCK POINTED TO HIS USUAL TIME OF DAY FOR BEING THERE HE SAW NO LIKENESS OF HIMSELF AMONG THE MULTITUDES THAT POURED IN THROUGH THE PORCH IT GAVE HIM LITTLE SURPRISE HOWEVER
1638-84447-0030 THOUGHT AND HOPED HE SAW HIS NEW BORN RESOLUTIONS CARRIED OUT IN THIS QUIET AND DARK BESIDE HIM STOOD THE PHANTOM WITH ITS OUTSTRETCHED HAND
1638-84447-0031 WHEN HE ROUSED HIMSELF FROM HIS THOUGHTFUL QUEST HE FANCIED FROM THE TURN OF THE HAND AND ITS SITUATION IN REFERENCE TO HIMSELF THAT THE UNSEEN EYES WERE LOOKING AT HIM KEENLY IT MADE HIM SHUDDER AND FEEL VERY COLD
1638-84447-0032 WHERE SCROOGE HAD NEVER PENETRATED BEFORE ALTHOUGH HE RECOGNISED ITS SITUATION AND ITS BAD REPUTE THE WAYS WERE FOUL AND NARROW THE SHOPS AND HOUSES WRETCHED THE PEOPLE HALF NAKED DRUNKEN SLIPSHOD
1638-84447-0033 UGLY ALLEYS AND ARCHWAYS LIKE SO MANY CESSPOOLS DISGORGED THEIR OFFENCES OF SMELL AND DIRT AND LIFE UPON THE STRAGGLING STREETS AND THE WHOLE QUARTER REEKED WITH CRIME WITH FILTH
1638-84447-0034 FAR IN THIS DEN OF INFAMOUS RESORT THERE WAS A LOW BROWED BEETLING SHOP BELOW A PENT HOUSE ROOF WHERE IRON OLD RAGS BOTTLES BONES AND GREASY OFFAL WERE BOUGHT
1638-84447-0035 UPON THE FLOOR WITHIN WERE PILED UP HEAPS OF RUSTY KEYS NAILS CHAINS HINGES FILES SCALES WEIGHTS AND REFUSE IRON OF ALL KINDS
1638-84447-0036 SECRETS THAT FEW WOULD LIKE TO SCRUTINISE WERE BRED AND HIDDEN IN MOUNTAINS OF UNSEEMLY RAGS MASSES OF CORRUPTED FAT
1638-84447-0037 SITTING IN AMONG THE WARES HE DEALT IN BY A CHARCOAL STOVE MADE OF OLD BRICKS WAS A GREY HAIRED RASCAL
1638-84447-0038 HUNG UPON A LINE AND SMOKED HIS PIPE IN ALL THE LUXURY OF CALM RETIREMENT SCROOGE AND THE PHANTOM CAME INTO THE PRESENCE OF THIS MAN JUST AS A WOMAN WITH A HEAVY BUNDLE SLUNK INTO THE SHOP
1638-84447-0039 BUT SHE HAD SCARCELY ENTERED WHEN ANOTHER WOMAN SIMILARLY LADEN CAME IN TOO AND SHE WAS CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY A MAN IN FADED BLACK WHO WAS NO LESS STARTLED BY THE SIGHT OF THEM THAN THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE RECOGNITION OF EACH OTHER
1638-84447-0040 AFTER A SHORT PERIOD OF BLANK ASTONISHMENT IN WHICH THE OLD MAN WITH THE PIPE HAD JOINED THEM THEY ALL THREE BURST INTO A LAUGH LET THE CHARWOMAN ALONE TO BE THE FIRST CRIED SHE WHO HAD ENTERED FIRST LET THE LAUNDRESS ALONE TO BE THE SECOND
1638-84447-0041 LOOK HERE OLD JOE HERE'S A CHANCE IF WE HAVEN'T ALL THREE MET HERE WITHOUT MEANING IT YOU COULDN'T HAVE MET IN A BETTER PLACE SAID OLD JOE REMOVING HIS PIPE FROM HIS MOUTH COME INTO THE PARLOUR
1638-84447-0042 YOU WERE MADE FREE OF IT LONG AGO YOU KNOW AND THE OTHER TWO AN'T STRANGERS STOP TILL I SHUT THE DOOR OF THE SHOP
1638-84447-0043 AND I'M SURE THERE'S NO SUCH OLD BONES HERE AS MINE HA HA WE'RE ALL SUITABLE TO OUR CALLING WE'RE WELL MATCHED COME INTO THE PARLOUR COME INTO THE PARLOUR
1638-84447-0044 THE OLD MAN RAKED THE FIRE TOGETHER WITH AN OLD STAIR ROD AND HAVING TRIMMED HIS SMOKY LAMP FOR IT WAS NIGHT WITH THE STEM OF HIS PIPE PUT IT IN HIS MOUTH AGAIN WHILE HE DID THIS THE WOMAN WHO HAD ALREADY SPOKEN
1638-84447-0045 THREW HER BUNDLE ON THE FLOOR AND SAT DOWN IN A FLAUNTING MANNER ON A STOOL CROSSING HER ELBOWS ON HER KNEES AND LOOKING WITH A BOLD DEFIANCE AT THE OTHER TWO WHAT ODDS THEN WHAT ODDS MISSUS DILBER SAID THE WOMAN
1638-84447-0046 EVERY PERSON HAS A RIGHT TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES HE ALWAYS DID THAT'S TRUE INDEED SAID THE LAUNDRESS NO MAN MORE SO
