5772-43330-0000 THE DARK WAS FALLING SOFTLY LAYER ON LAYER ACROSS THE ROOFS TO WESTWARD BURNED THE SMOULDERING FIRE OF THE WINTER SUNSET AND THE INTERIOR WAS FULL OF THE DYING LIGHT SHE HAD SLEPT A LITTLE IN HER CHAIR THAT AFTERNOON
5772-43330-0001 AND HAD AWAKENED WITH THAT STRANGE CLEANSED SENSE OF SPIRIT AND MIND THAT SOMETIMES FOLLOWS SUCH SLEEP
5772-43330-0002 SHE REMEMBERED AFTERWARDS AN UNUSUAL BUSY NESS ON THE BROAD TRACKS BENEATH HER AS SHE HAD LOOKED OUT ON THEM FROM HER WINDOWS AND AN UNUSUAL CALLING OF HORNS AND WHISTLES BUT SHE THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT AND PASSED DOWN AN HOUR LATER FOR A MEDITATION IN THE CHURCH
5772-43330-0003 ON THE SIGNIFICANCE THAT LAY BENEATH THE SURFACE OF LIFE THE HUGE PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH ALL LIVED AND WHICH SO PLAINLY WERE THE TRUE REALITIES INDEED SUCH DEVOTION WAS BECOMING ALMOST RECOGNISED AMONG CERTAIN CLASSES OF PEOPLE
5772-43330-0004 SHE WENT TO DAY TO HER USUAL SEAT SAT DOWN FOLDED HER HANDS LOOKED FOR A MINUTE OR TWO UPON THE OLD STONE SANCTUARY THE WHITE IMAGE AND THE DARKENING WINDOW THEN SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND BEGAN TO THINK ACCORDING TO THE METHOD SHE FOLLOWED
5772-43330-0005 THEN SHE SENT OUT HER POWERS SWEEPING WITH THE EYES OF HER MIND THE SEETHING WORLD SEEING BENEATH THE LIGHT AND DARK OF THE TWO HEMISPHERES THE COUNTLESS MILLIONS OF MANKIND CHILDREN COMING INTO THE WORLD OLD MEN LEAVING IT
5772-43330-0006 THE MATURE REJOICING IN IT AND THEIR OWN STRENGTH BACK THROUGH THE AGES SHE LOOKED THROUGH THOSE CENTURIES OF CRIME AND BLINDNESS AS THE RACE ROSE THROUGH SAVAGERY AND SUPERSTITION TO A KNOWLEDGE OF THEMSELVES ON THROUGH THE AGES YET TO COME
5772-43330-0007 AS GENERATION FOLLOWED GENERATION TO SOME CLIMAX WHOSE PERFECTION SHE TOLD HERSELF SHE COULD NOT FULLY COMPREHEND BECAUSE SHE WAS NOT OF IT YET SHE TOLD HERSELF AGAIN THAT CLIMAX HAD ALREADY BEEN BORN THE BIRTHPANGS WERE OVER
5772-43330-0008 FOR HAD NOT HE COME WHO WAS THE HEIR OF TIME THEN BY A THIRD AND VIVID ACT SHE REALISED THE UNITY OF ALL THE CENTRAL FIRE OF WHICH EACH SPARK WAS BUT A RADIATION THAT VAST PASSIONLESS DIVINE BEING
5772-43330-0009 REALISING HIMSELF UP THROUGH THESE CENTURIES ONE YET MANY HIM WHOM MEN HAD CALLED GOD NOW NO LONGER UNKNOWN
5772-43330-0010 HIM WHO NOW WITH THE COMING OF THE NEW SAVIOUR HAD STIRRED AND AWAKENED AND SHOWN HIMSELF AS ONE AND THERE SHE STAYED CONTEMPLATING THE VISION OF HER MIND DETACHING NOW THIS VIRTUE NOW THAT FOR PARTICULAR ASSIMILATION
5772-43330-0011 DWELLING ON HER DEFICIENCIES SEEING IN THE WHOLE THE FULFILMENT OF ALL ASPIRATIONS THE SUM OF ALL FOR WHICH MEN HAD HOPED THAT SPIRIT OF PEACE SO LONG HINDERED YET GENERATED TOO PERPETUALLY BY THE PASSIONS OF THE WORLD
5772-43330-0012 THERE SHE STAYED LOSING THE SENSE OF INDIVIDUALITY MERGING IT BY A LONG SUSTAINED EFFORT OF THE WILL DRINKING AS SHE THOUGHT LONG BREATHS OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE AND LOVE
5772-43330-0013 SOME SOUND SHE SUPPOSED AFTERWARDS DISTURBED HER AND SHE OPENED HER EYES AND THERE BEFORE HER LAY THE QUIET PAVEMENT GLIMMERING THROUGH THE DUSK THE STEP OF THE SANCTUARY
5772-43330-0014 IT WAS HERE THAT MEN HAD WORSHIPPED JESUS THAT BLOOD STAINED MAN OF SORROW WHO HAD BORNE EVEN ON HIS OWN CONFESSION NOT PEACE BUT A SWORD YET THEY HAD KNELT THOSE BLIND AND HOPELESS CHRISTIANS
5772-43330-0015 AH THE PATHOS OF IT ALL THE DESPAIRING ACCEPTANCE OF ANY CREED THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR SORROW THE WILD WORSHIP OF ANY GOD WHO HAD CLAIMED TO BEAR IT AND AGAIN CAME THE SOUND STRIKING ACROSS HER PEACE
5772-43330-0016 THOUGH AS YET SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAS NEARER NOW AND SHE TURNED IN ASTONISHMENT TO LOOK DOWN THE DUSKY NAVE IT WAS FROM WITHOUT THAT THE SOUND HAD COME THAT STRANGE MURMUR THAT ROSE AND FELL AGAIN AS SHE LISTENED
5772-43330-0017 SHE STOOD UP HER HEART QUICKENING A LITTLE ONLY ONCE BEFORE HAD SHE HEARD SUCH A SOUND ONCE BEFORE IN A SQUARE WHERE MEN RAGED ABOUT A POINT BENEATH A PLATFORM SHE STEPPED SWIFTLY OUT OF HER SEAT PASSED DOWN THE AISLE
5772-43330-0018 DREW BACK THE CURTAINS BENEATH THE WEST WINDOW LIFTED THE LATCH AND STEPPED OUT THE STREET FROM WHERE SHE LOOKED OVER THE RAILINGS THAT BARRED THE ENTRANCE TO THE CHURCH SEEMED UNUSUALLY EMPTY AND DARK TO RIGHT AND LEFT STRETCHED THE HOUSES
5772-43330-0019 OVERHEAD THE DARKENING SKY WAS FLUSHED WITH ROSE BUT IT SEEMED AS IF THE PUBLIC LIGHTS HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN THERE WAS NOT A LIVING BEING TO BE SEEN
5772-43330-0020 SEEING THE FACE LOOKING AT HER THEN SHE CLUNG TO THE BARS STARING OVER HER SHOULDER MABEL LIFTED THE LATCH IN AN INSTANT THE CHILD SPRANG IN RAN TO THE DOOR AND BEAT AGAINST IT THEN TURNING SEIZED HER DRESS AND COWERED AGAINST HER
5772-43330-0021 MABEL SHUT THE GATE THERE THERE SHE SAID WHO IS IT WHO ARE COMING BUT THE CHILD HID HER FACE DRAWING AT THE KINDLY SKIRTS AND THE NEXT MOMENT CAME THE ROAR OF VOICES AND THE TRAMPLING OF FOOTSTEPS
5772-43330-0022 IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A FEW SECONDS BEFORE THE HERALDS OF THAT GRIM PROCESSION CAME PAST FIRST CAME A FLYING SQUADRON OF CHILDREN LAUGHING TERRIFIED FASCINATED SCREAMING TURNING THEIR HEADS AS THEY RAN
5772-43330-0023 AS HE HAD BEEN AT BREAKFAST OF HER OWN BEDROOM WITH ITS SOFTENED PAPER
5772-43330-0024 SO THICK AND INCESSANT IT WAS SO COMPLETE HER CONCENTRATION IN THE SENSE OF SIGHT EXCEPT FOR THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FROM ITS SUDDENNESS AND OVERWHELMING FORCE SOME MOB OF PHANTOMS TROOPING ON A SUDDEN
5772-43330-0025 OUT OF SOME VISTA OF THE SPIRITUAL WORLD VISIBLE ACROSS AN OPEN SPACE AND ABOUT TO VANISH AGAIN IN OBSCURITY THAT EMPTY STREET WAS FULL NOW ON THIS SIDE AND THAT SO FAR AS SHE COULD SEE THE YOUNG MEN WERE GONE
5772-43330-0026 RUNNING OR WALKING SHE HARDLY KNEW ROUND THE CORNER TO THE RIGHT AND THE ENTIRE SPACE WAS ONE STREAM OF HEADS AND FACES PRESSING SO FIERCELY THAT THE GROUP AT THE RAILINGS WERE DETACHED LIKE WEEDS AND DRIFTED TOO SIDEWAYS CLUTCHING AT THE BARS
5772-43330-0027 AND SWEPT AWAY TOO AND VANISHED
5772-43330-0028 TURNING FROM SIDE TO SIDE BORNE FROM BENEATH FACES DISTORTED WITH PASSION LOOKED AT HER FROM TIME TO TIME AS THE MOVING SHOW WENT PAST OPEN MOUTHS CRIED AT HER BUT SHE HARDLY SAW THEM
5772-43330-0029 SHE WAS WATCHING THOSE STRANGE EMBLEMS STRAINING HER EYES THROUGH THE DUSK STRIVING TO DISTINGUISH THE BATTERED BROKEN SHAPES HALF GUESSING YET AFRAID TO GUESS THEN ON A SUDDEN FROM THE HIDDEN LAMPS BENEATH THE EAVES LIGHT LEAPED INTO BEING
