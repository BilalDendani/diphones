3488-85273-0000 THE IDENTITY OF THE VICTIM HAS NOT YET BEEN ESTABLISHED SIR THESE WORDS WERE SPOKEN TO THE CORONER BY INSPECTOR EDWARDS AT THE ADJOURNED INQUEST HELD ON JANUARY THE TWENTY SECOND FEW PEOPLE WERE IN COURT FOR UNTIL THE PRESENT
3488-85273-0001 THE PUBLIC HAD HAD NO INKLING AS TO WHAT HAD OCCURRED ON THAT FATAL NIGHT IN HARRINGTON GARDENS THE FIRST INQUEST HAD NOT BEEN COVERED BY ANY REPORTER AS THE POLICE HAD EXERCISED CONSIDERABLE INGENUITY IN KEEPING THE AFFAIR A SECRET
3488-85273-0002 BUT NOW AT THE ADJOURNED INQUIRY SECRECY WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE AND THE THREE REPORTERS PRESENT WERE FULL OF INQUISITIVENESS REGARDING THE EVIDENCE GIVEN ON THE PREVIOUS OCCASION AND LISTENED WITH ATTENTION WHILE IT WAS BEING READ OVER
3488-85273-0003 INSPECTOR EDWARDS HOWEVER HAD DEALT WITH THEM IN HIS USUALLY GENIAL MANNER
3488-85273-0004 AND BY THE EXERCISE OF CONSIDERABLE DIPLOMACY HAD SUCCEEDED IN ALLAYING THEIR SUSPICIONS THAT THERE WAS ANY REALLY GOOD NEWSPAPER STORY IN CONNECTION WITH IT THE MEDICAL WITNESSES WERE RECALLED BUT NEITHER HAD ANYTHING TO ADD TO THE DEPOSITIONS THEY HAD ALREADY MADE
3488-85273-0005 THE DECEASED HAD BEEN FATALLY STABBED BY A VERY KEEN KNIFE WITH A BLADE OF PECULIAR SHAPE THAT WAS ALL THE UNKNOWN HAD BEEN BURIED AND ALL THAT REMAINED IN EVIDENCE WAS A BUNDLE OF BLOOD STAINED CLOTHING SOME ARTICLES OF JEWELLERY
3488-85273-0006 A PAIR OF BOOTS HAT COAT GLOVES AND A GREEN LEATHER VANITY BAG ENDEAVOURS HAD BEEN MADE SIR TO TRACE SOME OF THE ARTICLES WORN BY THE DECEASED AND ALSO TO ESTABLISH THE LAUNDRY MARKS ON THE UNDERCLOTHING THE INSPECTOR WENT ON
3488-85273-0007 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE MARKS HAVE BEEN PRONOUNCED BY EXPERTS TO BE FOREIGN ONES AND THE WHOLE OF THE YOUNG LADY'S CLOTHES APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN MADE ABROAD IN FRANCE OR BELGIUM IT IS THOUGHT THE LAUNDRY MARKS ARE FOREIGN EH REMARKED THE CORONER
3488-85273-0008 PEERING AT THE WITNESS THROUGH HIS PINCE NEZ AND POISING HIS PEN IN HIS HAND ARE YOU ENDEAVOURING TO MAKE INQUIRY ABROAD CONCERNING THEM EVERY INQUIRY IS BEING MADE SIR IN A DOZEN CITIES ON THE CONTINENT IN FACT IN ALL THE CAPITALS
3488-85273-0009 AND THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DECEASED HAS BEEN CIRCULATED YES SIR PHOTOGRAPHS HAVE BEEN SENT THROUGH ALL THE CHANNELS IN EUROPE BUT UP TO THE PRESENT WE HAVE MET WITH NO SUCCESS EDWARDS REPLIED
3488-85273-0010 THERE IS A SUSPICION BECAUSE OF A NAME UPON A TAB IN THE YOUNG GIRL'S COAT THAT SHE MAY BE ITALIAN HENCE THE MOST ARDENT SEARCH IS BEING MADE BY THE ITALIAN AUTHORITIES INTO THE MANNER AND DESCRIPTIONS OF FEMALES LATELY REPORTED AS MISSING
3488-85273-0011 THE AFFAIR SEEMS REMARKABLY CURIOUS SAID THE CORONER IT WOULD CERTAINLY APPEAR THAT THE LADY WHO LOST HER LIFE WAS A STRANGER TO LONDON THAT IS WHAT WE BELIEVE SIR EDWARDS REPLIED
3488-85273-0012 SEATED NEAR HIM I SAW HOW KEEN AND SHREWD WAS THE EXPRESSION UPON HIS FACE WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT CERTAIN PERSONS VISITED THE FLAT ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION BUT THESE HAVE NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED
3488-85273-0013 THE OWNER OF THE FLAT HAS NOT YET BEEN FOUND HE HAVING ABSCONDED GONE ABROAD I SUPPOSE IT WOULD APPEAR SO SIR AND HIS DESCRIPTION HAS BEEN CIRCULATED ALSO
3488-85273-0014 ASKED THE CORONER YES A DETAILED DESCRIPTION TOGETHER WITH A RECENT PHOTOGRAPH WAS EDWARDS REPLY THEN HE ADDED WE HAVE RECEIVED THIS AT SCOTLAND YARD SIR
3488-85273-0015 AND HE HANDED A LETTER ON BLUE PAPER TO THE CORONER WHICH THE LATTER PERUSED CURIOUSLY AFTERWARDS PASSING IT OVER TO THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY RATHER REMARKABLE HE EXCLAIMED THEN WHEN THE JURY HAD COMPLETED READING THE ANONYMOUS LETTER ADDRESSING THEM HE SAID
3488-85273-0016 THE WRITER AS YOU WILL NOTE IS PREPARED TO REVEAL THE TRUTH OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR
3488-85273-0017 IN RETURN FOR A MONETARY REWARD IT IS OF COURSE A MATTER TO BE LEFT ENTIRELY AT THE DISCRETION OF THE POLICE I STARTED AT THIS STATEMENT AND GAZED ACROSS THE COURT DULL AND CHEERLESS ON THAT COLD WINTER'S AFTERNOON WHO HAD WRITTEN THAT ANONYMOUS LETTER WHO COULD IT BE WHO WAS READY TO REVEAL THE TRUTH IF PAID FOR DOING SO WAS PHRIDA'S TERRIBLE SECRET KNOWN
3488-85273-0018 I HELD MY BREATH AND LISTENED TO THE SLOW HARD WORDS OF THE CORONER
3488-85273-0019 AS HE AGAIN ADDRESSED SOME QUESTIONS TO THE GREAT DETECTIVE YES SIR EDWARDS WAS SAYING THERE IS DISTINCT EVIDENCE OF THE PRESENCE AT THE FLAT ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION OF SOME PERSON A WOMAN WHOSE IDENTITY WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN ESTABLISHING
3488-85273-0020 WE HOWEVER HAVE FORMED A THEORY WHICH CERTAINLY APPEARS TO BE BORNE OUT BY THE WRITER OF THE LETTER I HAVE JUST HANDED YOU THAT THE UNKNOWN WAS STRUCK DOWN BY THE HAND OF A WOMAN EH ASKED THE CORONER
3488-85273-0021 BUT I KNOW NOT WHAT HE SAID MY HEART WAS TOO FULL TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE BESIDES THE PERIL OF THE ONE WHOM I LOVED I KNOW THAT THE VERDICT RETURNED BY THE JURY WAS ONE OF WILFUL MURDER
3488-85273-0022 THEN I WENT OUT INTO THE FADING LIGHT OF THAT BRIEF LONDON DAY AND SEEKING EDWARDS WALKED AT HIS SIDE TOWARDS THE BUSY KENSINGTON HIGH STREET WE HAD NOT MET FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND HE OF COURSE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF MY VISIT TO BRUSSELS
3488-85273-0023 OUR GREETING WAS A CORDIAL ONE WHEREUPON I ASKED HIM WHAT WAS CONTAINED IN THE ANONYMOUS LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE YARD AH MISTER ROYLE IT'S VERY CURIOUS HE SAID THE CORONER HAS IT AT THIS MOMENT OR I'D SHOW IT TO YOU
3488-85273-0024 THE HANDWRITING IS A WOMAN'S AND IT HAS BEEN POSTED AT COLCHESTER AT COLCHESTER I ECHOED IN DISMAY
3488-85273-0025 OH NOTHING ONLY WELL
3488-85273-0026 WHY NOT COLCHESTER AS WELL AS CLAPHAM EH YES OF COURSE I LAUGHED BUT TELL ME WHAT DOES THE WOMAN SAY SHE SIMPLY DECLARES THAT SHE CAN ELUCIDATE THE MYSTERY
3488-85273-0027 AND GIVE US THE CORRECT CLUE EVEN BRING EVIDENCE IF REQUIRED AS TO THE ACTUAL PERSON WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME IF WE ON OUR PART WILL PAY FOR THE INFORMATION AND WHAT SHALL YOU DO I ASKED EAGERLY I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW
3488-85273-0028 THE LETTER ONLY ARRIVED THIS MORNING TO MORROW THE COUNCIL OF SEVEN WILL DECIDE WHAT ACTION WE TAKE DOES THE WOMAN GIVE HER NAME I ASKED WITH AFFECTED CARELESSNESS NO SHE ONLY GIVES THE NAME OF G PAYNE
3488-85273-0029 AND THE ADDRESS AS THE G P O LONDON SHE'S EVIDENTLY A RATHER CUTE PERSON G PAYNE THE WOMAN PETRE WITHOUT A DOUBT I RECOLLECTED HER TELEGRAM ASKING ME TO MEET HER SHE HAD SAID THAT
3488-85273-0030 AND SHE I KNEW LIVED AT MELBOURNE HOUSE IN THAT TOWN I SUPPOSE YOU WILL GET INTO COMMUNICATION WITH HER
3488-85273-0031 WHY SHE REQUIRES BLOOD MONEY REMARKED THE DETECTIVE AS WE STROLLED TOGETHER IN THE ARCADED ENTRANCE TO THE UNDERGROUND STATION AT HIGH STREET KENSINGTON I ALWAYS LOOK ASKANCE AT SUCH LETTERS WE RECEIVE MANY OF THEM AT THE YARD
3488-85273-0032 NOT A SINGLE MURDER MYSTERY COMES BEFORE US BUT WE RECEIVE LETTERS FROM CRANKS AND OTHERS OFFERING TO POINT OUT THE GUILTY PERSON
3488-85273-0033 I SUGGESTED AH THAT'S JUST IT MISTER ROYLE EXCLAIMED MY COMPANION GRAVELY YET IT IS SO TERRIBLY DIFFICULT TO DISCRIMINATE AND I FEAR WE OFTEN IN OUR HESITATION PLACE ASIDE LETTERS THE WRITERS OF WHICH COULD REALLY GIVE VALUABLE INFORMATION
3488-85273-0034 WHAT IS MAY I TERM IT YOUR PRIVATE OPINION HE HALTED AGAINST THE LONG SHOP WINDOWS OF DERRY AND TOMS AND PAUSED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES WELL HE SAID AT LAST IN A DEEPLY EARNEST TONE I TELL YOU FRANKLY MISTER ROYLE WHAT I BELIEVE
3488-85273-0035 FIRST I DON'T THINK THAT THE MAN KEMSLEY ALTHOUGH AN IMPOSTOR WAS THE ACTUAL ASSASSIN
3488-85273-0036 AND APPARENTLY WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST COMPUNCTION YET IN CONTRADICTION WE HAVE THE REMARKABLE FACT THAT THE REAL SIR DIGBY DIED IN SOUTH AMERICA IN VERY MYSTERIOUS AND TRAGIC CIRCUMSTANCES
3488-85273-0037 I SAW THAT A PROBLEM WAS PRESENTED TO INSPECTOR EDWARDS WHICH SORELY PUZZLED HIM AS IT CERTAINLY DID MYSELF WELL I ASKED AFTER A PAUSE AND THEN WITH SOME TREPIDATION PUT THE QUESTION WHAT DO YOU INTEND DOING
3488-85273-0038 DOING HE ECHOED THERE IS BUT ONE COURSE TO PURSUE WE MUST GET IN TOUCH WITH THIS WOMAN WHO SAYS SHE KNOWS THE TRUTH AND OBTAIN WHAT INFORMATION WE CAN FROM HER PERHAPS SHE CAN REVEAL THE IDENTITY OF THE WOMAN WHOSE FINGERS TOUCHED THAT GLASS TOPPED TABLE IN THE ROOM WHERE THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED IF SO THAT WILL TELL US A GREAT DEAL MISTER ROYLE
3488-85273-0039 THEN TAKING A CIGARETTE FROM HIS POCKET AND TAPPING IT HE ADDED DO YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN WONDERING OF LATE
3488-85273-0040 AND I TRIED TO CORROBORATE IT BUT YOU HAVE CORROBORATED IT HE DECLARED WHY MISTER ROYLE THOSE PRINTS YOU BROUGHT TO THE YARD
3488-85273-0041 ARE A MOST IMPORTANT CLUE WHERE DID YOU GET THEM I WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT JOSTLED BY THE CROWD OF PASSERS BY WELL I SAID WITH A FAINT SMILE REALISING WHAT A GRAVE MISTAKE I HAD MADE IN INCULPATING MY WELL BELOVED
