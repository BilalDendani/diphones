2758-86039-0000 WHICH WAS THE FOOLISHEST IN A LITTLE VILLAGE THAT STOOD ON A WIDE PLAIN WHERE YOU COULD SEE THE SUN FROM THE MOMENT HE ROSE TO THE MOMENT HE SET THERE LIVED TWO COUPLES SIDE BY SIDE
2758-86039-0001 THE MEN WHO WORKED UNDER THE SAME MASTER WERE QUITE GOOD FRIENDS BUT THE WIVES WERE ALWAYS QUARRELLING AND THE SUBJECT THEY QUARRELLED MOST ABOUT WAS WHICH OF THE TWO HAD THE STUPIDEST HUSBAND
2758-86039-0002 UNLIKE MOST WOMEN WHO THINK THAT ANYTHING THAT BELONGS TO THEM MUST BE BETTER THAN WHAT BELONGS TO ANYONE ELSE EACH THOUGHT HER HUSBAND THE MORE FOOLISH OF THE TWO
2758-86039-0003 YOU SHOULD JUST SEE WHAT HE DOES ONE SAID TO HER NEIGHBOUR HE PUTS ON THE BABY'S FROCK UPSIDE DOWN AND ONE DAY I FOUND HIM TRYING TO FEED HER WITH BOILING SOUP AND HER MOUTH WAS SCALDED FOR DAYS AFTER
2758-86039-0004 THEN HE PICKS UP STONES IN THE ROAD AND SOWS THEM INSTEAD OF POTATOES AND ONE DAY HE WANTED TO GO INTO THE GARDEN FROM THE TOP WINDOW BECAUSE HE DECLARED IT WAS A SHORTER WAY THAN THROUGH THE DOOR
2758-86039-0005 THAT IS BAD ENOUGH OF COURSE ANSWERED THE OTHER BUT IT IS REALLY NOTHING TO WHAT I HAVE TO ENDURE EVERY DAY FROM MY HUSBAND IF WHEN I AM BUSY I ASK HIM TO GO AND FEED THE POULTRY
2758-86039-0006 YES I AM AFRAID HE IS TRYING REPLIED THE FIRST BUT LET US PUT THEM TO THE PROOF AND SEE WHICH OF THEM IS THE MOST FOOLISH SO ABOUT THE TIME THAT SHE EXPECTED HER HUSBAND HOME FROM WORK
2758-86039-0007 SHE GOT OUT HER SPINNING WHEEL AND SAT BUSILY TURNING IT TAKING CARE NOT EVEN TO LOOK UP FROM HER WORK WHEN THE MAN CAME IN FOR SOME MINUTES HE STOOD WITH HIS MOUTH OPEN WATCHING HER AND AS SHE STILL REMAINED SILENT HE SAID AT LAST
2758-86039-0008 WHICH WILL BE WOVEN INTO A COAT FOR YOU DEAR ME HE REPLIED WHAT A CLEVER WIFE I HAVE GOT IF YOU HAD NOT TOLD ME I SHOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN THAT THERE WAS ANY WOOL ON THE WHEEL AT ALL
2758-86039-0009 BUT NOW I REALLY DO SEEM TO SEE SOMETHING THE WOMAN SMILED AND WAS SILENT AND AFTER SPINNING BUSILY FOR AN HOUR MORE SHE GOT UP FROM HER STOOP AND BEGAN TO WEAVE AS FAST AS SHE COULD AT LAST SHE GOT UP
2758-86039-0010 AND SAID TO HER HUSBAND I AM TOO TIRED TO FINISH IT TO NIGHT SO I SHALL GO TO BED AND TO MORROW I SHALL ONLY HAVE THE CUTTING AND STITCHING TO DO SO THE NEXT MORNING SHE GOT UP EARLY
2758-86039-0011 AND AFTER SHE HAD CLEANED HER HOUSE AND FED HER CHICKENS AND PUT EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE AGAIN SHE BENT OVER THE KITCHEN TABLE AND THE SOUND OF HER BIG SCISSORS MIGHT BE HEARD SNIP SNAP AS FAR AS THE GARDEN HER HUSBAND COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING TO SNIP AT
2758-86039-0012 BUT THEN HE WAS SO STUPID THAT WAS NOT SURPRISING AFTER THE CUTTING CAME THE SEWING THE WOMAN PATTED AND PINNED AND FIXED AND JOINED AND THEN TURNING TO THE MAN SHE SAID NOW IT IS READY FOR YOU TO TRY ON
2758-86039-0013 IT DOES NOT FEEL VERY WARM OBSERVED THE MAN AT LAST WHEN HE HAD BORNE ALL THIS PATIENTLY FOR A LONG TIME THAT IS BECAUSE IT IS SO FINE ANSWERED SHE YOU DO NOT WANT IT TO BE AS THICK AS THE ROUGH CLOTHES YOU WEAR EVERY DAY
2758-86039-0014 HE DID BUT WAS ASHAMED TO SAY SO AND ONLY ANSWERED WELL I AM SURE IT MUST BE BEAUTIFUL SINCE YOU SAY SO AND I SHALL BE SMARTER THAN ANYONE IN THE WHOLE VILLAGE WHAT A SPLENDID COAT THEY WILL EXCLAIM WHEN THEY SEE ME
2758-86039-0015 BUT IT IS NOT EVERYBODY WHO HAS A WIFE AS CLEVER AS MINE MEANWHILE THE OTHER WIFE WAS NOT IDLE AS SOON AS HER HUSBAND ENTERED SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH SUCH A LOOK OF TERROR THAT THE POOR MAN WAS QUITE FRIGHTENED
2758-86039-0016 IF YOU SLEEP WELL DURING THE MIGHT THERE MAY BE A CHANCE FOR YOU SAID SHE SHAKING HER HEAD AS SHE TUCKED HIM UP WARMLY BUT IF NOT AND OF COURSE THE POOR MAN NEVER CLOSED AN EYE TILL THE SUN ROSE
2758-86039-0017 HOW DO YOU FEEL THIS MORNING ASKED THE WOMAN COMING IN ON TIP TOE WHEN HER HOUSE WORK WAS FINISHED OH BAD VERY BAD INDEED ANSWERED HE I HAVE NOT SLEPT FOR A MOMENT CAN YOU THINK OF NOTHING TO MAKE ME BETTER
2758-86039-0018 I WILL TRY EVERYTHING THAT IS POSSIBLE SAID THE WIFE WHO DID NOT IN THE LEAST WISH HER HUSBAND TO DIE
2758-86039-0019 I WILL GET SOME DRIED HERBS AND MAKE YOU A DRINK BUT I AM VERY MUCH AFRAID THAT IT IS TOO LATE WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME BEFORE
2758-86039-0020 AND WHEN HE INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE MATTER SHE SOBBED OUT OH MY POOR POOR HUSBAND ARE YOU REALLY DEAD I MUST GO TO MORROW AND ORDER YOUR COFFIN NOW WHEN THE MAN HEARD THIS A COLD SHIVER RAN THROUGH HIS BODY
2758-86039-0021 AND ALL AT ONCE HE KNEW THAT HE WAS AS WELL AS HE HAD EVER BEEN IN HIS LIFE OH NO NO HE CRIED I FEEL QUITE RECOVERED INDEED I THINK I SHALL GO OUT TO WORK YOU WILL DO NO SUCH THING REPLIED HIS WIFE
2758-86039-0022 JUST KEEP QUITE QUIET FOR BEFORE THE SUN RISES YOU WILL BE A DEAD MAN THE MAN WAS VERY FRIGHTENED AT HER WORDS AND LAY ABSOLUTELY STILL WHILE THE UNDERTAKER CAME AND MEASURED HIM FOR HIS COFFIN
2758-86039-0023 AND HIS WIFE GAVE ORDERS TO THE GRAVEDIGGER ABOUT HIS GRAVE THAT EVENING THE COFFIN WAS SENT HOME AND IN THE MORNING AT NINE O'CLOCK THE WOMAN PUT HIM ON A LONG FLANNEL GARMENT AND CALLED TO THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN
2758-86039-0024 TO FASTEN DOWN THE LID AND CARRY HIM TO THE GRAVE WHERE ALL THEIR FRIENDS WERE WAITING THEM JUST AS THE BODY WAS BEING PLACED IN THE GROUND THE OTHER WOMAN'S HUSBAND CAME RUNNING UP DRESSED AS FAR AS ANYONE COULD SEE IN NO CLOTHES AT ALL
2758-86039-0025 AND THE MEN LAID DOWN THE COFFIN AND LAUGHED TOO TILL THEIR SIDES NEARLY SPLIT THE DEAD MAN WAS SO ASTONISHED AT THIS BEHAVIOUR THAT HE PEEPED OUT OF A LITTLE WINDOW IN THE SIDE OF THE COFFIN AND CRIED OUT
2758-86039-0026 I SHOULD LAUGH AS LOUDLY AS ANY OF YOU IF I WERE NOT A DEAD MAN WHEN THEY HEARD THE VOICE COMING FROM THE COFFIN THE OTHER PEOPLE SUDDENLY STOPPED LAUGHING AND STOOD AS IF THEY HAD BEEN TURNED INTO STONE
2758-86039-0027 THEN THEY RUSHED WITH ONE ACCORD TO THE COFFIN AND LIFTED THE LID SO THAT THE MAN COULD STEP OUT AMONGST THEM WERE YOU REALLY NOT DEAD AFTER ALL ASKED THEY AND IF NOT WHY DID YOU LET YOURSELF BE BURIED
2758-86039-0028 AT THIS THE WIVES BOTH CONFESSED THAT THEY HAD EACH WISHED TO PROVE THAT HER HUSBAND WAS STUPIDER THAN THE OTHER BUT THE VILLAGERS DECLARED THAT THEY COULD NOT DECIDE WHICH WAS THE MOST FOOLISH
2758-86039-0029 THE MAN WHO ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE PERSUADED THAT HE WAS WEARING FINE CLOTHES WHEN HE WAS DRESSED IN NOTHING OR THE MAN WHO LET HIMSELF BE BURIED WHEN HE WAS ALIVE AND WELL SO THE WOMEN QUARRELLED JUST AS MUCH AS THEY DID BEFORE
