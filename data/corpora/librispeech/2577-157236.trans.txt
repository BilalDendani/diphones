2577-157236-0000 CHAPTER FOUR TWO BAZAARS MOTHER WAS REALLY A GREAT DEAR SHE WAS PRETTY AND SHE WAS LOVING AND MOST FRIGHTFULLY GOOD WHEN YOU WERE ILL AND ALWAYS KIND AND ALMOST ALWAYS JUST
2577-157236-0001 THAT IS SHE WAS JUST WHEN SHE UNDERSTOOD THINGS BUT OF COURSE SHE DID NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTAND THINGS
2577-157236-0002 THE CHILDREN KNEW THAT MOTHER ALWAYS WANTED TO DO WHAT WAS BEST FOR THEM EVEN IF SHE WAS NOT CLEVER ENOUGH TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WAS THE BEST THAT WAS WHY ALL OF THEM BUT MUCH MORE PARTICULARLY ANTHEA
2577-157236-0003 AND ANTHEA WHOSE INSIDE MIND WAS MADE SO THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO BE MUCH MORE UNCOMFORTABLE THAN THE OTHERS HAD DECIDED THAT SHE MUST TELL HER MOTHER THE TRUTH HOWEVER LITTLE LIKELY IT WAS THAT HER MOTHER WOULD BELIEVE IT
2577-157236-0004 AND IF SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE ME IT WON'T BE MY FAULT WILL IT NOT IN THE LEAST SAID THE GOLDEN BIRD AND SHE WON'T SO YOU'RE QUITE SAFE ANTHEA CHOSE A TIME WHEN SHE WAS DOING HER HOME LESSONS THEY WERE ALGEBRA AND LATIN GERMAN ENGLISH AND EUCLID
2577-157236-0005 AND SHE ASKED HER MOTHER WHETHER SHE MIGHT COME AND DO THEM IN THE DRAWING ROOM
2577-157236-0006 AND THAT'S NOT THE REAL REASON I HOPE I SHAN'T GROW UP A LIAR MOTHER SAID OF COURSE DEARIE AND ANTHEA STARTED SWIMMING THROUGH A SEA OF X'S AND Y'S AND Z'S MOTHER WAS SITTING AT THE MAHOGANY BUREAU WRITING LETTERS

2577-157236-0012 BUT MOTHER SAID ANTHEA WHEN MOTHER PUT DOWN THE PEN TO LICK AN ENVELOPE THE CARPET TAKES US WHEREVER WE LIKE AND I WISH IT WOULD TAKE YOU WHERE YOU COULD GET A FEW NICE EASTERN THINGS FOR MY BAZAAR SAID MOTHER
2577-157236-0013 THE CARPET TOOK US TO A PLACE WHERE YOU COULDN'T HAVE WHOOPING COUGH
2577-157236-0014 AND WE TOOK COOK BECAUSE SHE WAS SO TIRESOME AND THEN SHE WOULD STAY AND BE QUEEN OF THE SAVAGES THEY THOUGHT HER CAP WAS A CROWN AND DARLING ONE SAID MOTHER YOU KNOW I LOVE TO HEAR THE THINGS YOU MAKE UP BUT I AM MOST AWFULLY BUSY

2577-157236-0018 MOTHER AND THE LAMB WENT AWAY AND FATHER WENT AWAY AND THERE WAS A NEW COOK WHO LOOKED SO LIKE A FRIGHTENED RABBIT THAT NO ONE HAD THE HEART TO DO ANYTHING TO FRIGHTEN HER ANY MORE THAN SEEMED NATURAL TO HER THE PHOENIX BEGGED TO BE EXCUSED
2577-157236-0019 IT SAID IT WANTED A WEEK'S REST AND ASKED THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE DISTURBED AND IT HID ITS GOLDEN GLEAMING SELF AND NOBODY COULD FIND IT
2577-157236-0020 SO THAT WHEN WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON BROUGHT AN UNEXPECTED HOLIDAY AND EVERY ONE DECIDED TO GO SOMEWHERE ON THE CARPET THE JOURNEY HAD TO BE UNDERTAKEN WITHOUT THE PHOENIX
2577-157236-0021 EXACTED IN THE AGITATION OF PARTING THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE OUT AFTER SIX AT NIGHT EXCEPT ON SATURDAY WHEN THEY WERE TO GO TO THE BAZAAR AND WERE PLEDGED TO PUT ON THEIR BEST CLOTHES TO WASH THEMSELVES TO THE UTTERMOST AND TO CLEAN THEIR NAILS
2577-157236-0022 NOT WITH SCISSORS WHICH ARE SCRATCHY AND BAD BUT WITH FLAT SHARPENED ENDS OF WOODEN MATCHES WHICH DO NO HARM TO ANY ONE'S NAILS LET'S GO AND SEE THE LAMB SAID JANE
2577-157236-0023 BUT EVERY ONE WAS AGREED THAT IF THEY APPEARED SUDDENLY IN BOURNEMOUTH IT WOULD FRIGHTEN MOTHER OUT OF HER WITS IF NOT INTO A FIT SO THEY SAT ON THE CARPET AND THOUGHT AND THOUGHT AND THOUGHT TILL THEY ALMOST BEGAN TO SQUINT LOOK HERE SAID CYRIL I KNOW
2577-157236-0024 PLEASE CARPET TAKE US SOMEWHERE WHERE WE CAN SEE THE LAMB AND MOTHER AND NO ONE CAN SEE US EXCEPT THE LAMB SAID JANE QUICKLY AND THE NEXT MOMENT THEY FOUND THEMSELVES RECOVERING FROM THE UPSIDE DOWN MOVEMENT
2577-157236-0025 THERE WERE GREEN PINE TREES OVERHEAD AND A SWIFT CLEAR LITTLE STREAM WAS RUNNING AS FAST AS EVER IT COULD BETWEEN STEEP BANKS AND THERE SITTING ON THE PINE NEEDLE CARPET WAS MOTHER WITHOUT HER HAT AND THE SUN WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOVEMBER
2577-157236-0026 AND THERE WAS THE LAMB AS JOLLY AS JOLLY AND NOT WHOOPING AT ALL THE CARPET'S DECEIVED US SAID ROBERT GLOOMILY MOTHER WILL SEE US DIRECTLY SHE TURNS HER HEAD BUT THE FAITHFUL CARPET HAD NOT DECEIVED THEM
2577-157236-0027 MOTHER TURNED HER DEAR HEAD AND LOOKED STRAIGHT AT THEM AND DID NOT SEE THEM WE'RE INVISIBLE CYRIL WHISPERED WHAT AWFUL LARKS BUT TO THE GIRLS IT WAS NOT LARKS AT ALL
2577-157236-0028 AS IF SHE DIDN'T CARE WHETHER SHE SAW US OR NOT
2577-157236-0029 AND HIS PRECIOUS FACE ALL DIRTY QUITE IN THE OLD FAMILIAR WAY
2577-157236-0030 CRIED THE LAMB IT WAS A DELICIOUS MOMENT EVEN THE BOYS THUMPED THEIR BABY BROTHER JOYOUSLY ON THE BACK THEN ANTHEA GLANCED AT MOTHER
2577-157236-0031 AND SHE WAS STARING AT THE LAMB AS IF SHE THOUGHT HE HAD GONE MAD AND INDEED THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE DID THINK MY LAMB MY PRECIOUS COME TO MOTHER SHE CRIED AND JUMPED UP AND RAN TO THE BABY
2577-157236-0032 AND TO FEEL WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE IS THE WORST SORT OF GHOST FEELING MOTHER PICKED UP THE LAMB AND HURRIED AWAY FROM THE PINEWOOD LET'S GO HOME SAID JANE AFTER A MISERABLE SILENCE IT FEELS JUST EXACTLY AS IF MOTHER DIDN'T LOVE US
2577-157236-0033 BUT THEY COULDN'T BEAR TO GO HOME TILL THEY HAD SEEN MOTHER MEET ANOTHER LADY AND KNEW THAT SHE WAS SAFE YOU CANNOT LEAVE YOUR MOTHER TO GO GREEN IN THE FACE IN A DISTANT PINEWOOD FAR FROM ALL HUMAN AID AND THEN GO HOME ON YOUR WISHING CARPET AS THOUGH NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
2577-157236-0034 WHEN MOTHER SEEMED SAFE THE CHILDREN RETURNED TO THE CARPET AND SAID HOME' AND HOME THEY WENT I DON'T CARE ABOUT BEING INVISIBLE MYSELF SAID CYRIL AT LEAST NOT WITH MY OWN FAMILY
2577-157236-0035 IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF YOU WERE A PRINCE OR A BANDIT OR A BURGLAR AND NOW THE THOUGHTS OF ALL FOUR DWELT FONDLY ON THE DEAR GREENISH FACE OF MOTHER I WISH SHE HADN'T GONE AWAY SAID JANE THE HOUSE IS SIMPLY BEASTLY WITHOUT HER
2577-157236-0036 I THINK WE OUGHT TO DO WHAT SHE SAID ANTHEA PUT IN I SAW SOMETHING IN A BOOK THE OTHER DAY ABOUT THE WISHES OF THE DEPARTED BEING SACRED THAT MEANS WHEN THEY'VE DEPARTED FARTHER OFF SAID CYRIL
2577-157236-0037 GET INDIAN THINGS FOR MY BAZAAR BUT I KNOW SHE THOUGHT WE COULDN'T AND IT WAS ONLY PLAY LET'S GET THEM ALL THE SAME SAID ROBERT WE'LL GO THE FIRST THING ON SATURDAY MORNING AND ON SATURDAY MORNING THE FIRST THING THEY WENT
2577-157236-0038 THERE WAS NO FINDING THE PHOENIX SO THEY SAT ON THE BEAUTIFUL WISHING CARPET AND SAID WE WANT INDIAN THINGS FOR MOTHER'S BAZAAR WILL YOU PLEASE TAKE US WHERE PEOPLE WILL GIVE US HEAPS OF INDIAN THINGS
2577-157236-0039 THE DOCILE CARPET SWIRLED THEIR SENSES AWAY AND RESTORED THEM ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF A GLEAMING WHITE INDIAN TOWN THEY KNEW IT WAS INDIAN AT ONCE BY THE SHAPE OF THE DOMES AND ROOFS AND BESIDES A MAN WENT BY ON AN ELEPHANT
2577-157236-0040 AND TWO ENGLISH SOLDIERS WENT ALONG THE ROAD TALKING LIKE IN MISTER KIPLING'S BOOKS SO AFTER THAT NO ONE COULD HAVE ANY DOUBT AS TO WHERE THEY WERE THEY ROLLED UP THE CARPET AND ROBERT CARRIED IT AND THEY WALKED BODILY INTO THE TOWN
2577-157236-0041 IT WAS VERY WARM AND ONCE MORE THEY HAD TO TAKE OFF THEIR LONDON IN NOVEMBER COATS AND CARRY THEM ON THEIR ARMS THE STREETS WERE NARROW AND STRANGE AND THE CLOTHES OF THE PEOPLE IN THE STREETS WERE STRANGER AND THE TALK OF THE PEOPLE WAS STRANGEST OF ALL
2577-157236-0042 I CAN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD SAID CYRIL HOW ON EARTH ARE WE TO ASK FOR THINGS FOR OUR BAZAAR AND THEY'RE POOR PEOPLE TOO SAID JANE I'M SURE THEY ARE WHAT WE WANT IS A RAJAH OR SOMETHING
2577-157236-0043 ROBERT WAS BEGINNING TO UNROLL THE CARPET BUT THE OTHERS STOPPED HIM IMPLORING HIM NOT TO WASTE A WISH WE ASKED THE CARPET TO TAKE US WHERE WE COULD GET INDIAN THINGS FOR BAZAARS SAID ANTHEA AND IT WILL HER FAITH WAS JUSTIFIED
2577-157236-0044 JUST AS SHE FINISHED SPEAKING A VERY BROWN GENTLEMAN IN A TURBAN CAME UP TO THEM AND BOWED DEEPLY
2577-157236-0045 MY RANEE SHE THINK YOU VERY NICE CHILDS SHE ASKS DO YOU LOSE YOURSELVES AND DO YOU DESIRE TO SELL CARPET SHE SEE YOU FROM HER PALKEE
2577-157236-0046 THE OLD RANEE SAT ON A LOW CUSHIONED SEAT AND THERE WERE A LOT OF OTHER LADIES WITH HER ALL IN TROUSERS AND VEILS AND SPARKLING WITH TINSEL AND GOLD AND JEWELS AND THE BROWN TURBANED GENTLEMAN STOOD BEHIND A SORT OF CARVED SCREEN
2577-157236-0047 AND INTERPRETED WHAT THE CHILDREN SAID AND WHAT THE QUEEN SAID AND WHEN THE QUEEN ASKED TO BUY THE CARPET THE CHILDREN SAID NO WHY ASKED THE RANEE AND JANE BRIEFLY SAID WHY AND THE INTERPRETER INTERPRETED THE QUEEN SPOKE AND THEN THE INTERPRETER SAID
2577-157236-0048 MY MISTRESS SAYS IT IS A GOOD STORY AND YOU TELL IT ALL THROUGH WITHOUT THOUGHT OF TIME AND THEY HAD TO IT MADE A LONG STORY ESPECIALLY AS IT HAD ALL TO BE TOLD TWICE ONCE BY CYRIL AND ONCE BY THE INTERPRETER CYRIL RATHER ENJOYED HIMSELF
2577-157236-0049 HE WARMED TO HIS WORK AND TOLD THE TALE OF THE PHOENIX AND THE CARPET AND THE LONE TOWER AND THE QUEEN COOK IN LANGUAGE THAT GREW INSENSIBLY MORE AND MORE ARABIAN NIGHTSY AND THE RANEE AND HER LADIES LISTENED TO THE INTERPRETER AND ROLLED ABOUT ON THEIR FAT CUSHIONS WITH LAUGHTER
2577-157236-0050 WHEN THE STORY WAS ENDED SHE SPOKE AND THE INTERPRETER EXPLAINED THAT SHE HAD SAID LITTLE ONE THOU ART A HEAVEN BORN TELLER OF TALES AND SHE THREW HIM A STRING OF TURQUOISES FROM ROUND HER NECK OH HOW LOVELY CRIED JANE AND ANTHEA
2577-157236-0051 THANK HER VERY VERY MUCH BUT I WOULD MUCH RATHER SHE GAVE ME SOME OF THE CHEAP THINGS IN THE BAZAAR TELL HER I WANT THEM TO SELL AGAIN AND GIVE THE MONEY TO BUY CLOTHES FOR POOR PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T ANY
2577-157236-0052 TELL HIM HE HAS MY LEAVE TO SELL MY GIFT AND CLOTHE THE NAKED WITH ITS PRICE SAID THE QUEEN WHEN THIS WAS TRANSLATED BUT CYRIL SAID VERY FIRMLY NO THANK YOU THE THINGS HAVE GOT TO BE SOLD TO DAY AT OUR BAZAAR AND NO ONE WOULD BUY A TURQUOISE NECKLACE AT AN ENGLISH BAZAAR
2577-157236-0053 THEY'D THINK IT WAS SHAM OR ELSE THEY'D WANT TO KNOW WHERE WE GOT IT SO THEN THE QUEEN SENT OUT FOR LITTLE PRETTY THINGS AND HER SERVANTS PILED THE CARPET WITH THEM I MUST NEEDS LEND YOU AN ELEPHANT TO CARRY THEM AWAY SHE SAID LAUGHING BUT ANTHEA SAID
2577-157236-0054 IF THE QUEEN WILL LEND US A COMB AND LET US WASH OUR HANDS AND FACES SHE SHALL SEE A MAGIC THING WE AND THE CARPET AND ALL THESE BRASS TRAYS AND POTS AND CARVED THINGS AND STUFFS AND THINGS WILL JUST VANISH AWAY LIKE SMOKE
2577-157236-0055 THE QUEEN CLAPPED HER HANDS AT THIS IDEA AND LENT THE CHILDREN A SANDAL WOOD COMB INLAID WITH IVORY LOTUS FLOWERS AND THEY WASHED THEIR FACES AND HANDS IN SILVER BASINS THEN CYRIL MADE A VERY POLITE FAREWELL SPEECH AND QUITE SUDDENLY HE ENDED WITH THE WORDS
2577-157236-0056 AND I WISH WE WERE AT THE BAZAAR AT OUR SCHOOLS AND OF COURSE THEY WERE AND THE QUEEN AND HER LADIES WERE LEFT WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN GAZING AT THE BARE SPACE ON THE INLAID MARBLE FLOOR WHERE THE CARPET AND THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN
2577-157236-0057 THAT IS MAGIC IF EVER MAGIC WAS SAID THE QUEEN DELIGHTED WITH THE INCIDENT WHICH INDEED HAS GIVEN THE LADIES OF THAT COURT SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT ON WET DAYS EVER SINCE
2577-157236-0058 CYRIL'S STORIES HAD TAKEN SOME TIME SO HAD THE MEAL OF STRANGE SWEET FOODS THAT THEY HAD HAD WHILE THE LITTLE PRETTY THINGS WERE BEING BOUGHT AND THE GAS IN THE SCHOOLROOM WAS ALREADY LIGHTED
2577-157236-0059 OUTSIDE THE WINTER DUSK WAS STEALING DOWN AMONG THE CAMDEN TOWN HOUSES I'M GLAD WE GOT WASHED IN INDIA SAID CYRIL WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWFULLY LATE IF WE'D HAD TO GO HOME AND SCRUB BESIDES ROBERT SAID IT'S MUCH WARMER WASHING IN INDIA
2577-157236-0060 I SHOULDN'T MIND IT SO MUCH IF WE LIVED THERE THE THOUGHTFUL CARPET HAD DUMPED THE CHILDREN DOWN IN A DUSKY SPACE BEHIND THE POINT WHERE THE CORNERS OF TWO STALLS MET THE FLOOR WAS LITTERED WITH STRING AND BROWN PAPER AND BASKETS AND BOXES WERE HEAPED ALONG THE WALL
2577-157236-0061 BUT ROBERT AS HE CAUTIOUSLY EMERGED WAS ACTUALLY WALKED ON BY MISSUS BIDDLE WHO KEPT THE STALL HER LARGE SOLID FOOT STOOD FIRMLY ON THE SMALL SOLID HAND OF ROBERT AND WHO CAN BLAME ROBERT IF HE DID YELL A LITTLE
2577-157236-0062 A CROWD INSTANTLY COLLECTED YELLS ARE VERY UNUSUAL AT BAZAARS AND EVERY ONE WAS INTENSELY INTERESTED IT WAS SEVERAL SECONDS BEFORE THE THREE FREE CHILDREN COULD MAKE MISSUS BIDDLE UNDERSTAND
2577-157236-0063 THAT WHAT SHE WAS WALKING ON WAS NOT A SCHOOLROOM FLOOR OR EVEN AS SHE PRESENTLY SUPPOSED A DROPPED PIN CUSHION BUT THE LIVING HAND OF A SUFFERING CHILD WHEN SHE BECAME AWARE THAT SHE REALLY HAD HURT HIM SHE GREW VERY ANGRY INDEED
2577-157236-0064 WE WERE LOOKING AT THE THINGS IN THE CORNER SUCH NASTY PRYING WAYS SAID MISSUS BIDDLE WILL NEVER MAKE YOU SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE THERE'S NOTHING THERE BUT PACKING AND DUST OH ISN'T THERE SAID JANE THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW
2577-157236-0065 LITTLE GIRL DON'T BE RUDE SAID MISSUS BIDDLE FLUSHING VIOLET SHE DOESN'T MEAN TO BE BUT THERE ARE SOME NICE THINGS THERE ALL THE SAME SAID CYRIL WHO SUDDENLY FELT HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS TO INFORM THE LISTENING CROWD
2577-157236-0066 THAT ALL THE TREASURES PILED ON THE CARPET WERE MOTHER'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BAZAAR NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE IT AND IF THEY DID AND WROTE TO THANK MOTHER SHE WOULD THINK WELL GOODNESS ONLY KNEW WHAT SHE WOULD THINK THE OTHER THREE CHILDREN FELT THE SAME
2577-157236-0067 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM SAID A VERY NICE LADY WHOSE FRIENDS HAD DISAPPOINTED HER
2577-157236-0068 SHE LOOKED INQUIRINGLY AT ROBERT WHO SAID WITH PLEASURE DON'T MENTION IT AND DIVED BACK UNDER MISSUS BIDDLE'S STALL I WONDER YOU ENCOURAGE SUCH BEHAVIOUR SAID MISSUS BIDDLE I ALWAYS SPEAK MY MIND AS YOU KNOW MISS PEASMARSH
2577-157236-0069 AND I MUST SAY I AM SURPRISED SHE TURNED TO THE CROWD THERE IS NO ENTERTAINMENT HERE SHE SAID STERNLY A VERY NAUGHTY LITTLE BOY HAS ACCIDENTALLY HURT HIMSELF BUT ONLY SLIGHTLY WILL YOU PLEASE DISPERSE IT WILL ONLY ENCOURAGE HIM IN NAUGHTINESS IF HE FINDS HIMSELF THE CENTRE OF ATTRACTION
2577-157236-0070 THE CROWD SLOWLY DISPERSED ANTHEA SPEECHLESS WITH FURY HEARD A NICE CURATE SAY POOR LITTLE BEGGAR AND LOVED THE CURATE AT ONCE AND FOR EVER
2577-157236-0071 THEN ROBERT WRIGGLED OUT FROM UNDER THE STALL WITH SOME BENARES BRASS AND SOME INLAID SANDALWOOD BOXES LIBERTY CRIED MISS PEASMARSH THEN CHARLES HAS NOT FORGOTTEN AFTER ALL
2577-157236-0072 EXCUSE ME SAID MISSUS BIDDLE WITH FIERCE POLITENESS THESE OBJECTS ARE DEPOSITED BEHIND MY STALL SOME UNKNOWN DONOR WHO DOES GOOD BY STEALTH AND WOULD BLUSH IF HE COULD HEAR YOU CLAIM THE THINGS OF COURSE THEY ARE FOR ME
2577-157236-0073 MY STALL TOUCHES YOURS AT THE CORNER SAID POOR MISS PEASMARSH TIMIDLY AND MY COUSIN DID PROMISE THE CHILDREN SIDLED AWAY FROM THE UNEQUAL CONTEST AND MINGLED WITH THE CROWD THEIR FEELINGS WERE TOO DEEP FOR WORDS TILL AT LAST ROBERT SAID
2577-157236-0074 THAT STIFF STARCHED PIG AND AFTER ALL OUR TROUBLE I'M HOARSE WITH GASSING TO THAT TROUSERED LADY IN INDIA THE PIG LADY'S VERY VERY NASTY SAID JANE IT WAS ANTHEA WHO SAID IN A HURRIED UNDERTONE
2577-157236-0075 SHE ISN'T VERY NICE AND MISS PEASMARSH IS PRETTY AND NICE TOO WHO'S GOT A PENCIL IT WAS A LONG CRAWL UNDER THREE STALLS BUT ANTHEA DID IT A LARGE PIECE OF PALE BLUE PAPER LAY AMONG THE RUBBISH IN THE CORNER
2577-157236-0076 ALL THESE INDIAN THINGS ARE FOR PRETTY NICE MISS PEASMARSH'S STALL SHE THOUGHT OF ADDING THERE IS NOTHING FOR MISSUS BIDDLE BUT SHE SAW THAT THIS MIGHT LEAD TO SUSPICION SO SHE WROTE HASTILY FROM AN UNKNOWN DONNA
2577-157236-0077 AND CREPT BACK AMONG THE BOARDS AND TRESTLES TO JOIN THE OTHERS SO THAT WHEN MISSUS BIDDLE APPEALED TO THE BAZAAR COMMITTEE AND THE CORNER OF THE STALL WAS LIFTED AND SHIFTED SO THAT STOUT CLERGYMEN AND HEAVY LADIES COULD GET TO THE CORNER WITHOUT CREEPING UNDER STALLS
2577-157236-0078 THE BLUE PAPER WAS DISCOVERED AND ALL THE SPLENDID SHINING INDIAN THINGS WERE GIVEN OVER TO MISS PEASMARSH AND SHE SOLD THEM ALL AND GOT THIRTY FIVE POUNDS FOR THEM I DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THAT BLUE PAPER SAID MISSUS BIDDLE IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE WORK OF A LUNATIC
2577-157236-0079 AND SAYING YOU WERE NICE AND PRETTY IT'S NOT THE WORK OF A SANE PERSON
2577-157236-0080 MISS PEASMARSH WAS VERY WILLING FOR NOW HER STALL THAT HAD BEEN SO NEGLECTED WAS SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO BUY AND SHE WAS GLAD TO BE HELPED THE CHILDREN NOTED THAT MISSUS BIDDLE HAD NOT MORE TO DO IN THE WAY OF SELLING THAN SHE COULD MANAGE QUITE WELL
2577-157236-0081 I HOPE THEY WERE NOT GLAD FOR YOU SHOULD FORGIVE YOUR ENEMIES EVEN IF THEY WALK ON YOUR HANDS AND THEN SAY IT IS ALL YOUR NAUGHTY FAULT BUT I AM AFRAID THEY WERE NOT SO SORRY AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN IT TOOK SOME TIME TO ARRANGE THE THINGS ON THE STALL
2577-157236-0082 IT WAS A HAPPY AND BUSY AFTERNOON AND WHEN MISS PEASMARSH AND THE GIRLS HAD SOLD EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE LITTLE PRETTY THINGS FROM THE INDIAN BAZAAR FAR FAR AWAY ANTHEA AND JANE WENT OFF WITH THE BOYS TO FISH IN THE FISHPOND AND DIVE INTO THE BRAN PIE AND HEAR THE CARDBOARD BAND
2577-157236-0083 AND THE PHONOGRAPH AND THE CHORUS OF SINGING BIRDS THAT WAS DONE BEHIND A SCREEN WITH GLASS TUBES AND GLASSES OF WATER THEY HAD A BEAUTIFUL TEA SUDDENLY PRESENTED TO THEM BY THE NICE CURATE AND MISS PEASMARSH JOINED THEM BEFORE THEY HAD HAD MORE THAN THREE CAKES EACH
2577-157236-0084 WE OUGHT TO GET BACK TO THE STALL SAID ANTHEA WHEN NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY EAT ANY MORE AND THE CURATE WAS TALKING IN A LOW VOICE TO MISS PEAS MARSH ABOUT AFTER EASTER THERE'S NOTHING TO GO BACK FOR SAID MISS PEASMARSH GAILY
2577-157236-0085 THANKS TO YOU DEAR CHILDREN WE'VE SOLD EVERYTHING
2577-157236-0086 OH SAID MISS PEASMARSH RADIANTLY DON'T BOTHER ABOUT THE CARPET I'VE SOLD EVEN THAT MISSUS BIDDLE GAVE ME TEN SHILLINGS FOR IT
2577-157236-0087 FOR WHO BRINGS CARPETS TO BAZAARS THE CHILDREN WERE NOW THOROUGHLY WRETCHED BUT I AM GLAD TO SAY THAT THEIR WRETCHEDNESS DID NOT MAKE THEM FORGET THEIR MANNERS AS IT DOES SOMETIMES EVEN WITH GROWN UP PEOPLE WHO OUGHT TO KNOW EVER SO MUCH BETTER
2577-157236-0088 AND AS THEY WENT AWAY THEY HEARD THE CURATE SAY
2577-157236-0089 AH DO SAY YOU WILL AND JANE RAN BACK AND SAID BEFORE ANTHEA COULD DRAG HER AWAY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO AFTER EASTER MISS PEASMARSH SMILED AND LOOKED VERY PRETTY INDEED AND THE CURATE SAID
2577-157236-0090 I HOPE I AM GOING TO TAKE A TRIP TO THE FORTUNATE ISLANDS I WISH WE COULD TAKE YOU ON THE WISHING CARPET SAID JANE THANK YOU SAID THE CURATE BUT I'M AFRAID I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT I MUST GO TO THE FORTUNATE ISLANDS BEFORE THEY MAKE ME A BISHOP I SHOULD HAVE NO TIME AFTERWARDS
2577-157236-0091 HIS APRONS WOULD COME IN SO USEFUL WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO MARRY A BISHOP MISS PEASMARSH IT WAS THEN THAT THEY DRAGGED HER AWAY AS IT WAS ROBERT'S HAND THAT MISSUS BIDDLE HAD WALKED ON IT WAS DECIDED THAT HE HAD BETTER NOT RECALL THE INCIDENT TO HER MIND
2577-157236-0092 AND SO MAKE HER ANGRY AGAIN ANTHEA AND JANE HAD HELPED TO SELL THINGS AT THE RIVAL STALL SO THEY WERE NOT LIKELY TO BE POPULAR A HASTY COUNCIL OF FOUR DECIDED THAT MISSUS BIDDLE WOULD HATE CYRIL LESS THAN SHE WOULD HATE THE OTHERS SO THE OTHERS MINGLED WITH THE CROWD AND IT WAS HE WHO SAID TO HER
2577-157236-0093 MISSUS BIDDLE WE MEANT TO HAVE THAT CARPET WOULD YOU SELL IT TO US WE WOULD GIVE YOU CERTAINLY NOT SAID MISSUS BIDDLE GO AWAY LITTLE BOY THERE WAS THAT IN HER TONE WHICH SHOWED CYRIL ALL TOO PLAINLY THE HOPELESSNESS OF PERSUASION

2577-157236-0095 IT WOULD BE A SORT OF FORLORN HOPE RESCUE PARTY HEROIC AND DARING AND DASHING AND NOT WRONG AT ALL THE CHILDREN STILL WANDERED AMONG THE GAY CROWD BUT THERE WAS NO PLEASURE THERE FOR THEM ANY MORE THE CHORUS OF SINGING BIRDS SOUNDED JUST LIKE GLASS TUBES BEING BLOWN THROUGH WATER
2577-157236-0096 AND HOT PEOPLE AND CAKE AND CRUMBS AND ALL THE CHILDREN WERE VERY TIRED INDEED THEY FOUND A CORNER WITHIN SIGHT OF THE CARPET AND THERE THEY WAITED MISERABLY TILL IT WAS FAR BEYOND THEIR PROPER BEDTIME
2577-157236-0097 AND TO JAW ABOUT IT SAID ROBERT
