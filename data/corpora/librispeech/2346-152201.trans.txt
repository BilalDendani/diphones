2346-152201-0000 CHAPTER FIVE THE GLACIER EVEN THAT DAY
2346-152201-0001 OUR TENT BEING GONE WE DREW HIS HIDE OVER US AND RESTED AS BEST WE COULD KNOWING THAT AT LEAST WE HAD NO MORE AVALANCHES TO FEAR THAT NIGHT IT FROZE SHARPLY
2346-152201-0002 WHEN THE SNOW SLIDE BEGAN IT WOULD I THINK HAVE GONE HARD WITH US AS IT WAS WE SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL HORACE SAID LEO AT THE DAWN I AM GOING TO LEAVE THIS IF WE HAVE TO DIE I WOULD RATHER DO SO MOVING
2346-152201-0003 BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE SHALL DIE VERY WELL I SAID LET US START IF THE SNOW WON'T BEAR US NOW IT NEVER WILL SO WE TIED UP OUR RUGS
2346-152201-0004 NOW ALTHOUGH THE MOUNT WAS UNDER TWO HUNDRED FEET HIGH ITS BASE FORTUNATELY FOR US FOR OTHERWISE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE MIGHTY PRESSURE OF THE AVALANCHE WAS BROAD
2346-152201-0005 SO THAT THERE WAS A LONG EXPANSE OF PILED UP SNOW BETWEEN US AND THE LEVEL GROUND SINCE OWING TO THE OVERHANGING CONFORMATION OF THE PLACE IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO DESCEND IN FRONT
2346-152201-0006 WHERE PRESSURE HAD MADE THE SNOW HARD AS STONE WE WERE OBLIGED TO RISK A MARCH OVER THE LOOSER MATERIAL UPON ITS FLANK AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE GAINED BY WAITING OFF WE WENT LEO LEADING AND STEP BY STEP TRYING THE SNOW
2346-152201-0007 TO OUR JOY WE DISCOVERED THAT THE SHARP NIGHT FROST HAD SO HARDENED ITS SURFACE THAT IT WOULD SUPPORT US ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN HOWEVER WHERE THE PRESSURE HAD BEEN LESS IT BECAME MUCH SOFTER
2346-152201-0008 OVER A LARGER SURFACE AND THUS SLITHER GENTLY DOWN THE HILL ALL WENT WELL UNTIL WE WERE WITHIN TWENTY PACES OF THE BOTTOM WHERE WE MUST CROSS A SOFT MOUND
2346-152201-0009 FORMED OF THE POWDERY DUST THROWN OFF BY THE AVALANCHE IN ITS RUSH LEO SLIPPED OVER SAFELY BUT I
2346-152201-0010 FOLLOWING A YARD OR TWO TO HIS RIGHT OF A SUDDEN FELT THE HARD CRUST YIELD BENEATH ME AN ILL JUDGED BUT QUITE NATURAL FLOUNDER AND WRIGGLE
2346-152201-0011 COMPLETED THE MISCHIEF AND WITH ONE PIERCING BUT SWIFTLY STIFLED YELL
2346-152201-0012 ANY ONE WHO HAS EVER SUNK IN DEEP WATER WILL KNOW THAT THE SENSATION IS NOT PLEASANT BUT I CAN ASSURE HIM THAT TO GO THROUGH THE SAME EXPERIENCE IN SOFT SNOW IS INFINITELY WORSE
2346-152201-0013 MUD ALONE COULD SURPASS ITS TERRORS DOWN I WENT AND DOWN TILL AT LENGTH I SEEMED TO REACH A ROCK WHICH ALONE SAVED ME FROM DISAPPEARING FOR EVER NOW I FELT THE SNOW CLOSING ABOVE ME AND WITH IT CAME DARKNESS
2346-152201-0014 AND A SENSE OF SUFFOCATION SO SOFT WAS THE DRIFT HOWEVER THAT BEFORE I WAS OVERCOME I CONTRIVED WITH MY ARMS TO THRUST AWAY THE POWDERY DUST FROM ABOUT MY HEAD THUS FORMING A LITTLE HOLLOW INTO WHICH AIR FILTERED SLOWLY
2346-152201-0015 GETTING MY HANDS UPON THE STONE I STROVE TO RISE BUT COULD NOT THE WEIGHT UPON ME WAS TOO GREAT THEN I ABANDONED HOPE AND PREPARED TO DIE THE PROCESS PROVED NOT ALTOGETHER UNPLEASANT
2346-152201-0016 ARE SUPPOSED TO DO BUT AND THIS SHOWS HOW STRONG WAS HER EMPIRE OVER ME MY MIND FLEW BACK TO AYESHA I SEEMED TO BEHOLD HER AND A MAN AT HER SIDE STANDING OVER ME IN SOME DARK ROCKY GULF
2346-152201-0017 SHE WAS WRAPPED IN A LONG TRAVELLING CLOAK AND HER LOVELY EYES WERE WILD WITH FEAR I ROSE TO SALUTE HER AND MAKE REPORT BUT SHE CRIED IN A FIERCE CONCENTRATED VOICE WHAT EVIL THING HAS HAPPENED HERE
2346-152201-0018 WHERE IS MY LORD LEO
2346-152201-0019 OR DIE THE VISION WAS EXTRAORDINARILY REAL AND VIVID I REMEMBER AND CONSIDERED IN CONNECTION WITH A CERTAIN SUBSEQUENT EVENT IN ALL WAYS MOST REMARKABLE BUT IT PASSED AS SWIFTLY AS IT CAME THEN
2346-152201-0020 MY SENSES LEFT ME I SAW A LIGHT AGAIN I HEARD A VOICE THAT OF LEO
2346-152201-0021 SOMETHING WAS THRUST AGAINST MY OUTSTRETCHED HAND
2346-152201-0022 I DID NOT MOVE THEN BETHINKING ME I DREW UP MY LEGS AND BY CHANCE OR THE MERCY OF HEAVEN I KNOW NOT GOT MY FEET AGAINST A RIDGE OF THE ROCK ON WHICH I WAS LYING AGAIN I FELT THE STRAIN AND THRUST WITH ALL MY MIGHT
2346-152201-0023 OF A SUDDEN THE SNOW GAVE AND OUT OF THAT HOLE I SHOT LIKE A FOX FROM ITS EARTH I STRUCK SOMETHING IT WAS LEO STRAINING AT THE GUN AND I KNOCKED HIM BACKWARDS THEN DOWN THE STEEP SLOPE WE ROLLED
2346-152201-0024 LANDING AT LENGTH UPON THE VERY EDGE OF THE PRECIPICE I SAT UP DRAWING IN THE AIR WITH GREAT GASPS AND OH HOW SWEET IT WAS MY EYES FELL UPON MY HAND AND I SAW THAT THE VEINS STOOD OUT ON THE BACK OF IT
2346-152201-0025 BLACK AS INK AND LARGE AS CORDS
2346-152201-0026 HOW LONG WAS I IN THERE I GASPED TO LEO WHO SAT AT MY SIDE
2346-152201-0027 DON'T KNOW NEARLY TWENTY MINUTES I SHOULD THINK TWENTY MINUTES IT SEEMED LIKE TWENTY CENTURIES HOW DID YOU GET ME OUT YOU COULD NOT STAND UPON THE DRIFT DUST NO I LAY UPON THE YAK SKIN WHERE THE SNOW WAS HARDER AND TUNNELLED
2346-152201-0028 TOWARDS YOU THROUGH THE POWDERY STUFF WITH MY HANDS FOR I KNEW WHERE YOU HAD SUNK AND IT WAS NOT FAR OFF AT LAST I SAW YOUR FINGER TIPS THEY WERE SO BLUE THAT FOR A FEW SECONDS I TOOK THEM FOR ROCK BUT THRUST THE BUTT OF THE RIFLE AGAINST THEM
2346-152201-0029 LUCKILY YOU STILL HAD LIFE ENOUGH TO CATCH HOLD OF IT AND YOU KNOW THE REST WERE WE NOT BOTH VERY STRONG IT COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN DONE
2346-152201-0030 WHY SHOULD YOU THANK ME HE ASKED WITH ONE OF HIS QUICK SMILES
2346-152201-0031 COME IF YOU HAVE GOT YOUR BREATH LET US BE GETTING ON YOU HAVE BEEN SLEEPING IN A COLD BED AND WANT EXERCISE
2346-152201-0032 WELL IT WILL SAVE US THE TROUBLE OF CARRYING THE CARTRIDGES AND HE LAUGHED DREARILY THEN WE BEGAN OUR MARCH HEADING FOR THE SPOT WHERE THE ROAD ENDED FOUR MILES OR SO AWAY FOR TO GO FORWARD SEEMED USELESS IN DUE COURSE
2346-152201-0033 WE REACHED IT SAFELY ONCE A MASS OF SNOW AS LARGE AS A CHURCH SWEPT DOWN
2346-152201-0034 AND LEAPING OVER OUR HEADS VANISHED WITH AN ANGRY SCREAM INTO THE DEPTHS BENEATH BUT WE TOOK LITTLE HEED OF THESE THINGS OUR NERVES WERE DEADENED AND NO DANGER SEEMED TO AFFECT THEM THERE WAS THE END OF THE ROAD
2346-152201-0035 THE SIGHT OF THEM AFFECTED ME FOR IT SEEMED STRANGE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE LIVED TO LOOK UPON THEM AGAIN WE STARED OVER THE EDGE OF THE PRECIPICE YES IT WAS SHEER AND ABSOLUTELY UNCLIMBABLE COME TO THE GLACIER SAID LEO
2346-152201-0036 SO WE WENT ON TO IT AND SCRAMBLING A LITTLE WAY DOWN ITS ROOT MADE AN EXAMINATION HERE SO FAR AS WE COULD JUDGE THE CLIFF WAS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FEET DEEP BUT WHETHER OR NO THE TONGUE OF ICE REACHED TO THE FOOT OF IT
2346-152201-0037 OF THE OVERHANGING ROCKS ON EITHER SIDE WAS SUCH THAT WE COULD NOT SEE WHERE IT TERMINATED WE CLIMBED BACK AGAIN AND SAT DOWN AND DESPAIR TOOK HOLD OF US BITTER BLACK DESPAIR
2346-152201-0038 WHAT ARE WE TO DO I ASKED IN FRONT OF US DEATH BEHIND US DEATH FOR HOW CAN WE RECROSS THOSE MOUNTAINS WITHOUT FOOD OR GUNS TO SHOOT IT WITH
2346-152201-0039 HERE DEATH FOR WE MUST SIT AND STARVE WE HAVE STRIVEN AND FAILED LEO OUR END IS AT HAND ONLY A MIRACLE CAN SAVE US A MIRACLE
2346-152201-0040 HE ANSWERED WELL WHAT WAS IT THAT LED US TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNT
2346-152201-0041 WHY SHOULD THE DESTINY BE BAULKED AT LAST HE PAUSED
2346-152201-0042 I WOULD NOT TURN BACK UPON OUR SPOOR SINCE TO DO SO WOULD PROVE ME A COWARD AND UNWORTHY OF HER I WILL GO ON
2346-152201-0043 IS A ROAD TO DEATH WELL IF SO HORACE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THIS LAND MEN FIND LIFE IN DEATH OR SO THEY BELIEVE IF WE DIE NOW WE SHALL DIE TRAVELLING OUR PATH AND IN THE COUNTRY WHERE WE PERISH
2346-152201-0044 WE MAY BE BORN AGAIN AT LEAST I AM DETERMINED SO YOU MUST CHOOSE I HAVE CHOSEN LONG AGO LEO WE BEGAN THIS JOURNEY TOGETHER AND WE WILL END IT TOGETHER PERHAPS AYESHA KNOWS AND WILL HELP US
2346-152201-0045 AND I LAUGHED DREARILY IF NOT COME WE ARE WASTING TIME THEN WE TOOK COUNSEL AND THE END OF IT WAS THAT WE CUT A SKIN RUG AND THE YAK'S
2346-152201-0046 TOUGH HIDE INTO STRIPS AND KNOTTED THESE TOGETHER INTO TWO SERVICEABLE ROPES WHICH WE FASTENED ABOUT OUR MIDDLES LEAVING ONE END LOOSE FOR WE THOUGHT THAT THEY MIGHT HELP US IN OUR DESCENT
2346-152201-0047 I WAS OLD IT WAS TIME THAT I SHOULD DIE I HAD LIVED INNOCENTLY IF IT WERE INNOCENT TO FOLLOW THIS LOVELY IMAGE THIS SIREN OF THE CAVES WHO LURED US ON TO DOOM NO
2346-152201-0048 I WAS PROUD OF HIM SO IN BROKEN ACCENTS I BLESSED HIM AND WISHED HIM WELL THROUGH ALL THE AEONS
2346-152201-0049 PRAYING THAT I MIGHT BE HIS COMPANION TO THE END OF TIME IN FEW WORDS AND SHORT HE THANKED ME AND GAVE ME BACK MY BLESSING THEN HE MUTTERED COME SO SIDE BY SIDE WE BEGAN THE TERRIBLE DESCENT
2346-152201-0050 AT FIRST IT WAS EASY ENOUGH ALTHOUGH A SLIP WOULD HAVE HURLED US TO ETERNITY
2346-152201-0051 ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH PLACES MOREOVER AND MADE NONE ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE WAY DOWN WE PAUSED STANDING UPON A GREAT BOULDER THAT WAS EMBEDDED IN THE ICE AND TURNING ROUND CAUTIOUSLY LEANED OUR BACKS AGAINST THE GLACIER AND LOOKED ABOUT US
2346-152201-0052 TRULY IT WAS A HORRIBLE PLACE ALMOST SHEER NOR DID WE LEARN MUCH FOR BENEATH US A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FEET OR MORE THE PROJECTING BEND CUT OFF OUR VIEW OF WHAT LAY BELOW SO
2346-152201-0053 FEELING THAT OUR NERVES WOULD NOT BEAR A PROLONGED CONTEMPLATION OF THAT DIZZY GULF ONCE MORE WE SET OUR FACES TO THE ICE AND PROCEEDED ON THE DOWNWARD CLIMB NOW MATTERS WERE MORE DIFFICULT
2346-152201-0054 FOR THE STONES WERE FEWER AND ONCE OR TWICE WE MUST SLIDE TO REACH THEM NOT KNOWING IF WE SHOULD EVER STOP AGAIN BUT THE ROPES WHICH WE THREW OVER THE ANGLES OF THE ROCKS OR SALIENT POINTS OF ICE LETTING OURSELVES DOWN BY THEIR HELP
2346-152201-0055 AND DRAWING THEM AFTER US WHEN WE REACHED THE NEXT FOOTHOLD SAVED US FROM DISASTER THUS AT LENGTH WE CAME TO THE BEND WHICH WAS MORE THAN HALF WAY DOWN THE PRECIPICE BEING SO FAR AS I COULD JUDGE
2346-152201-0056 OF THE NARROW GULF HERE WERE NO STONES BUT ONLY SOME ROUGH ICE ON WHICH WE SAT TO REST WE MUST LOOK SAID LEO PRESENTLY BUT THE QUESTION WAS HOW TO DO THIS INDEED THERE WAS ONLY
2346-152201-0057 ONE WAY TO HANG OVER THE BEND AND DISCOVER WHAT LAY BELOW WE READ EACH OTHER'S THOUGHT WITHOUT THE NEED OF WORDS AND I MADE A MOTION AS THOUGH I WOULD START NO SAID LEO I AM YOUNGER AND STRONGER THAN YOU COME HELP ME
2346-152201-0058 AND HE BEGAN TO FASTEN THE END OF HIS ROPE TO A STRONG PROJECTING POINT OF ICE NOW HE SAID HOLD MY ANKLES IT SEEMED AN INSANITY BUT THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO BE DONE SO FIXING MY HEELS IN A NICHE
2346-152201-0059 I GRASPED THEM AND SLOWLY HE SLID FORWARD TILL HIS BODY VANISHED TO THE MIDDLE WHAT HE SAW DOES NOT MATTER FOR I SAW IT ALL AFTERWARDS BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT SUDDENLY ALL HIS GREAT WEIGHT CAME UPON MY ARMS WITH SUCH A JERK THAT HIS ANKLES WERE TORN FROM MY GRIP
2346-152201-0060 OR WHO KNOWS PERHAPS IN MY TERROR I LOOSED THEM OBEYING THE NATURAL IMPULSE WHICH PROMPTS A MAN TO SAVE HIS OWN LIFE IF SO MAY I BE FORGIVEN BUT HAD I HELD ON I MUST HAVE BEEN JERKED INTO THE ABYSS THEN THE ROPE RAN OUT
2346-152201-0061 WHAT IT REALLY SAID WAS DON'T COME BUT INDEED AND MAY IT GO TO MY CREDIT I DID NOT PAUSE TO THINK BUT FACE OUTWARDS JUST AS I WAS SITTING BEGAN TO SLIDE AND SCRAMBLE DOWN THE ICE
2346-152201-0062 IN TWO SECONDS I HAD REACHED THE CURVE IN THREE I WAS OVER IT BENEATH WAS WHAT I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS A GREAT ICICLE BROKEN OFF SHORT AND SEPARATED FROM THE CLIFF BY ABOUT FOUR YARDS OF SPACE THIS ICICLE
2346-152201-0063 WAS NOT MORE THAN FIFTEEN FEET IN LENGTH AND SLOPED OUTWARDS SO THAT MY DESCENT WAS NOT SHEER MOREOVER AT THE END OF IT THE TRICKLING
2346-152201-0064 HAD WORN AWAY THE ICE LEAVING A LITTLE LEDGE AS BROAD PERHAPS AS A MAN'S HAND THERE WERE ROUGHNESSES ON THE SURFACE BELOW THE CURVE UPON WHICH MY CLOTHING CAUGHT ALSO I GRIPPED THEM DESPERATELY WITH MY FINGERS
2346-152201-0065 THE LITTLE LEDGE REMAINED ALMOST UPRIGHT WITH OUTSTRETCHED ARMS LIKE A PERSON CRUCIFIED TO A CROSS OF ICE THEN I SAW EVERYTHING AND THE SIGHT CURDLED THE BLOOD WITHIN MY VEINS HANGING TO THE ROPE
2346-152201-0066 WAS LEO OUT OF REACH OF IT AND OUT OF REACH OF THE CLIFF AS HE HUNG TURNING SLOWLY ROUND AND ROUND MUCH AS FOR IN A DREADFUL INCONSEQUENT FASHION THE ABSURD SIMILARITY STRUCK ME EVEN THEN A JOINT TURNS BEFORE THE FIRE
2346-152201-0067 BELOW YAWNED THE BLACK GULF AND AT THE BOTTOM OF IT
2346-152201-0068 WHITE SHEET OF SNOW THAT IS WHAT I SAW THINK OF IT THINK OF IT I CRUCIFIED UPON THE ICE MY HEELS RESTING UPON A LITTLE LEDGE MY FINGERS GRASPING EXCRESCENCES
2346-152201-0069 ON WHICH A BIRD COULD SCARCELY HAVE FOUND A FOOTHOLD ROUND AND BELOW ME DIZZY SPACE TO CLIMB BACK WHENCE I CAME WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STIR EVEN WAS IMPOSSIBLE SINCE ONE SLIP AND I MUST BE GONE AND BELOW ME
2346-152201-0070 HUNG LIKE A SPIDER TO ITS CORD LEO TURNING SLOWLY ROUND AND ROUND I COULD SEE THAT ROPE OF GREEN HIDE STRETCH BENEATH HIS WEIGHT
2346-152201-0071 THE HIDE OR THE KNOTS OR WHETHER IT WOULD HOLD TILL HE DROPPED FROM THE NOOSE LIMB BY LIMB OH I HAVE BEEN IN MANY A PERILOUS PLACE
2346-152201-0072 NEVER IN SUCH A ONE AS THIS AGONY TOOK HOLD OF ME A COLD SWEAT BURST FROM EVERY PORE I COULD FEEL IT RUNNING DOWN MY FACE LIKE TEARS MY HAIR BRISTLED UPON MY HEAD AND BELOW IN UTTER SILENCE
2346-152201-0073 LEO TURNED ROUND AND ROUND AND EACH TIME HE TURNED HIS UP CAST EYES MET MINE WITH A LOOK THAT WAS HORRIBLE TO SEE THE SILENCE WAS THE WORST OF IT THE SILENCE AND THE HELPLESSNESS IF HE HAD CRIED OUT IF HE HAD STRUGGLED
2346-152201-0074 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER BUT TO KNOW THAT HE WAS ALIVE THERE WITH EVERY NERVE AND PERCEPTION
2346-152201-0075 OH MY GOD OH MY GOD MY LIMBS BEGAN TO ACHE AND YET I DARED NOT STIR A MUSCLE THEY ACHED HORRIBLY OR SO I THOUGHT AND BENEATH THIS TORTURE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL
2346-152201-0076 MY MIND GAVE I REMEMBERED THINGS REMEMBERED HOW AS A CHILD I HAD CLIMBED A TREE AND REACHED A PLACE WHENCE I COULD MOVE NEITHER UP NOR DOWN AND WHAT I SUFFERED THEN
2346-152201-0077 REMEMBERED HOW ONCE IN EGYPT A FOOLHARDY FRIEND OF MINE HAD ASCENDED THE SECOND PYRAMID ALONE AND BECOME THUS CRUCIFIED UPON ITS SHINING CAP WHERE HE REMAINED FOR A WHOLE HALF HOUR
2346-152201-0078 WITH FOUR HUNDRED FEET OF SPACE BENEATH HIM I COULD SEE HIM NOW STRETCHING HIS STOCKINGED FOOT DOWNWARDS IN A VAIN ATTEMPT TO REACH THE NEXT CRACK AND DRAWING IT BACK AGAIN COULD SEE HIS TORTURED FACE A WHITE BLOT UPON THE RED GRANITE THEN
2346-152201-0079 THAT FACE VANISHED AND BLACKNESS GATHERED ROUND ME AND IN THE BLACKNESS VISIONS OF THE LIVING RESISTLESS AVALANCHE OF THE SNOW GRAVE INTO WHICH I HAD SUNK OH
2346-152201-0080 BLACKNESS AND SILENCE THROUGH WHICH I COULD ONLY HEAR THE CRACKING OF MY MUSCLES SUDDENLY IN THE BLACKNESS A FLASH
2346-152201-0081 AND THE SOUND WAS THAT OF THE NOISE HE MADE A GHASTLY NOISE HALF SHOUT OF DEFIANCE AND HALF YELL OF TERROR AS AT THE THIRD STROKE IT PARTED I SAW IT PART THE TOUGH HIDE WAS HALF CUT THROUGH AND ITS SEVERED PORTION
2346-152201-0082 CURLED UPWARDS AND DOWNWARDS LIKE THE UPPER AND LOWER LIPS OF AN ANGRY DOG WHILST THAT WHICH WAS UNSEVERED STRETCHED OUT SLOWLY SLOWLY TILL IT GREW QUITE THIN
2346-152201-0083 ANOTHER INSTANT AND I HEARD A CRACKLING THUDDING SOUND LEO HAD STRUCK THE GROUND BELOW LEO WAS DEAD A MANGLED MASS OF FLESH AND BONE AS I HAD PICTURED HIM I COULD NOT BEAR IT
2346-152201-0084 MY NERVE AND HUMAN DIGNITY CAME BACK I WOULD NOT WAIT UNTIL MY STRENGTH EXHAUSTED I SLID FROM MY PERCH AS A WOUNDED BIRD FALLS FROM A TREE NO I WOULD FOLLOW HIM AT ONCE
2346-152201-0085 OF MY OWN ACT I LET MY ARMS FALL AGAINST MY SIDES AND REJOICED IN THE RELIEF FROM PAIN THAT THE MOVEMENT GAVE ME THEN BALANCED UPON MY HEELS I STOOD UPRIGHT TOOK MY LAST LOOK AT THE SKY
2346-152201-0086 MUTTERED MY LAST PRAYER FOR AN INSTANT I REMAINED THUS POISED SHOUTING I COME I RAISED MY HANDS ABOVE MY HEAD AND DIVED AS A
