8786-276749-0000 AN OBSTACLE HAD ARISEN AGAINST SUCCESSFUL TAXATION ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE ENTIRE TAXABLE PROPERTY OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES CONSISTED IN LAND AND SLAVES UNDER THE PROVISIONAL CONSTITUTION WHICH CEASED TO BE IN FORCE ON FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
8786-276749-0001 ALL DUTIES IMPOSTS AND EXCISES SHOULD BE UNIFORM THROUGHOUT THE STATES OF THE CONFEDERACY
8786-276749-0002 BUT IN THE PERMANENT CONSTITUTION WHICH TOOK EFFECT ON THE SAME DAY
8786-276749-0003 REPRESENTATIVES AND DIRECT TAXES SHALL BE APPORTIONED AMONG THE SEVERAL STATES ACCORDING TO THEIR RESPECTIVE NUMBERS WHICH SHALL BE DETERMINED BY ADDING TO THE WHOLE NUMBER OF FREE PERSONS INCLUDING THOSE BOUND TO SERVICE FOR A TERM OF YEARS AND EXCLUDING INDIANS NOT TAXED
8786-276749-0004 WHICH HAD BEEN ACQUIESCED IN FOR SIXTY YEARS TAXES ON LANDS AND SLAVES WERE DIRECT TAXES IN REPEATING WITHOUT MODIFICATION IN OUR CONSTITUTION THIS LANGUAGE OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION OUR CONVENTION NECESSARILY SEEMS TO HAVE INTENDED TO ATTACH TO IT
8786-276749-0005 THE MEANING WHICH HAD BEEN SANCTIONED BY LONG AND UNINTERRUPTED ACQUIESCENCE THUS DECIDING THAT TAXES ON LANDS AND SLAVES WERE DIRECT TAXES OUR CONSTITUTION FURTHER ORDERED THAT A CENSUS SHOULD BE MADE WITHIN THREE YEARS AFTER THE FIRST MEETING OF CONGRESS
8786-276749-0006 SO LONG AS THERE SEEMED TO BE A PROBABILITY OF BEING ABLE TO CARRY OUT THESE PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION FULLY AND IN CONFORMITY WITH THE INTENTIONS OF ITS AUTHORS THERE WAS AN OBVIOUS DIFFICULTY IN FRAMING ANY SYSTEM OF TAXATION
8786-276749-0007 A LAW WHICH SHOULD EXEMPT FROM THE BURDEN TWO THIRDS OF THE PROPERTY OF THE COUNTRY WOULD BE AS UNFAIR TO THE OWNERS OF THE REMAINING THIRD AS IT WOULD BE INADEQUATE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE THE URGENCY OF THE NEED HOWEVER WAS SUCH THAT
8786-276749-0008 AFTER GREAT EMBARRASSMENT THE LAW OF APRIL TWENTY FOURTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE ABOVE MENTIONED WAS FRAMED STILL A VERY LARGE PROPORTION OF THESE RESOURCES WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR SOME TIME AND THE INTERVENING EXIGENCIES PERMITTING OF NO DELAY
8786-276749-0009 A RESORT TO FURTHER ISSUES OF TREASURY NOTES BECAME UNAVOIDABLE
8786-276749-0010 THE EARLIEST PROPOSALS ON WHICH THIS DEBT WAS CONTRACTED WERE ISSUED IN LONDON AND PARIS IN MARCH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE THE BONDS BORE INTEREST AT SEVEN PER CENT PER ANNUM IN STERLING PAYABLE HALF YEARLY THEY WERE EXCHANGEABLE FOR COTTON ON APPLICATION
8786-276749-0011 AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDER OR REDEEMABLE AT PAR IN STERLING IN TWENTY YEARS BY HALF YEARLY DRAWINGS COMMENCING MARCH FIRST EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR THE SPECIAL SECURITY OF THESE BONDS WAS THE ENGAGEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO DELIVER COTTON TO THE HOLDERS
8786-276749-0012 EACH BOND AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDER WAS CONVERTIBLE AT ITS NOMINAL AMOUNT INTO COTTON AT THE RATE OF SIXPENCE STERLING FOR EACH POUND OF COTTON SAY FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS OF COTTON FOR EACH BOND OF A HUNDRED POUNDS OR TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS
8786-276749-0013 AND THIS COULD BE DONE AT ANY TIME NOT LATER THAN SIX MONTHS AFTER THE RATIFICATION OF A TREATY OF PEACE BETWEEN THE BELLIGERENTS SIXTY DAYS AFTER THE NOTICE THE COTTON WAS TO BE DELIVERED IF IN A STATE OF PEACE AT THE PORTS OF CHARLESTON SAVANNAH
8786-276749-0014 OR NEW ORLEANS IF AT WAR AT POINTS IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY WITHIN TEN MILES OF A RAILROAD OR A STREAM NAVIGABLE TO THE OCEAN THE DELIVERY WAS TO BE MADE FREE OF ALL CHARGES EXCEPT THE EXPORT DUTY OF ONE EIGHTH OF ONE CENT PER POUND
8786-276749-0015 THE QUALITY OF THE COTTON WAS TO BE THE STANDARD OF NEW ORLEANS MIDDLING AN ANNUAL SINKING FUND OF FIVE PER CENT WAS PROVIDED FOR WHEREBY TWO AND A HALF PER CENT OF THE BONDS UNREDEEMED BY COTTON SHOULD BE DRAWN BY LOT HALF YEARLY
8786-276749-0016 SO AS FINALLY TO EXTINGUISH THE LOAN IN TWENTY YEARS FROM THE FIRST DRAWING THE BONDS WERE ISSUED AT NINETY PER CENT PAYABLE IN INSTALLMENTS THE LOAN SOON STOOD IN THE LONDON MARKET AT FIVE PER CENT PREMIUM THE AMOUNT ASKED FOR WAS THREE MILLION POUNDS
8786-276749-0017 THE AMOUNT OF APPLICATIONS IN LONDON AND PARIS EXCEEDED FIFTEEN MILLION POUNDS
8786-276749-0018 THAN WHOM NO ONE KNEW BETTER HOW FALSE WERE THE ATTEMPTS TO IMPLICATE MY NAME IN THAT CHARGE THE SLANDEROUS TONGUES OF NORTHERN HATRED EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO STYLE ME
8786-276749-0019 TO RAISE A LOAN OF MONEY ON THE CREDIT OF THE STATE OR TO PLEDGE THE FAITH OF THE STATE FOR THE PAYMENT OR REDEMPTION OF ANY LOAN OR DEBT
8786-276749-0020 UNLESS SUCH LAW SHOULD BE PROPOSED AND ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE THEN PUBLISHED FOR THREE MONTHS PREVIOUS TO THE NEXT REGULAR ELECTION AND FINALLY REENACTED BY THE SUCCEEDING LEGISLATURE THE OBJECT WAS TO ENABLE THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION INTELLIGENTLY
8786-276749-0021 AND TO INDICATE AND EXERCISE THEIR WILL UPON IT BY THE ELECTION OF REPRESENTATIVES TO THE ENSUING LEGISLATURE WHOSE VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT WOULD BE KNOWN AND WITH SUCH INSTRUCTIONS EXPRESS OR IMPLIED AS THEY MIGHT THINK PROPER TO GIVE IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN
8786-276749-0022 A LAW WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE FOR INCORPORATING THE UNION BANK OF MISSISSIPPI WITH A CAPITAL OF FIFTEEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
8786-276749-0023 TO BE RAISED BY MEANS OF A LOAN TO BE OBTAINED BY THE DIRECTORS OF THE INSTITUTION
8786-276749-0024 THIS ACT WAS DULY PROMULGATED TO THE PEOPLE AND DULY REENACTED BY THE SUCCEEDING LEGISLATURE ON THE FIFTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONSTITUTION TEN DAYS AFTERWARD HOWEVER VIZ ON THE FIFTEENTH OF FEBRUARY
8786-276749-0025 THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AN ACT SUPPLEMENTAL TO THE ACT CHARTERING THE UNION BANK WHICH MATERIALLY CHANGED OR ABOLISHED THE ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS FOR THE PLEDGE OF THE CREDIT OF THE STATE BY THIS SUPPLEMENTAL ACT
8786-276749-0026 SUBSCRIBE FOR IN BEHALF OF THE STATE FIFTY THOUSAND SHARES OF THE STOCK OF THE ORIGINAL CAPITAL OF SAID BANK TO BE PAID FOR OUT OF THE PROCEEDS OF THE STATE BONDS TO BE EXECUTED TO THE SAID BANK AS ALREADY PROVIDED FOR IN THE SAID CHARTER
8786-276749-0027 THIS ACT WAS PASSED IN THE ORDINARY MODE OF LEGISLATION AND WAS NOT REFERRED PUBLISHED NOR REENACTED AS PRESCRIBED BY THE CONSTITUTION AS SOON AS THE DIRECTORY WAS ORGANIZED AND THE BOOKS OF SUBSCRIPTION WERE OPENED
8786-276749-0028 AND BEFORE THE MORTGAGES REQUIRED BY THE CHARTER WERE EXECUTED THE GOVERNOR IN BEHALF OF THE STATE SUBSCRIBED FOR FIFTY THOUSAND SHARES OF THE STOCK AND ISSUED THE BONDS OF THE STATE FOR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PAYABLE TO THE ORDER OF THE BANK
8786-276749-0029 THESE BONDS WERE SOLD TO NICHOLAS BIDDLE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BANK OF PENNSYLVANIA AND BY HIM SENT TO GREAT BRITAIN AS COLLATERAL SECURITY FOR A LOAN PREVIOUSLY MADE
8786-276749-0030 NONE OF THE MONEY RECEIVED FOR THEM WENT INTO THE TREASURY OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI NOR WAS ANY OF IT USED FOR A PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT ALL THE CONSIDERATION EVER RECEIVED BY THE STATE WAS ITS STOCK IN THE UNION BANK THE BANK SOON FAILED
8786-276749-0031 AND THE STOCK BECAME UTTERLY WORTHLESS BEFORE THE BONDS BECAME DUE THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE HAD DECLARED THEM TO BE NULL AND VOID AMONG OTHER CAUSES IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE FAILURE TO SELL THEM AT PAR AS REQUIRED BY THE SUPPLEMENTAL ACT UNDER WHICH THEY WERE ISSUED
8786-276749-0032 IT IS NOT NECESSARY HERE TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION OF THE VALIDITY OR NULLITY OF THE BONDS THE OBJECT IS MERELY TO STATE THE PRINCIPAL FACTS WHILE THESE EVENTS WERE OCCURRING AND UNTIL A PERIOD SEVERAL YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO THEIR CONSUMMATION I
8786-276749-0033 AND NEITHER HAD NOR COULD HAVE HAD ANY PART IN SHAPING THE POLICY OF THE STATE WHEN BROUGHT OUT AS A CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE MY NOMINATION WAS OPPOSED BY THAT SECTION OF MY PARTY WHICH ADVOCATED REPUDIATION ON ACCOUNT OF MY OPINIONS IN FAVOR OF THE PAYMENT OF THE BONDS
8786-276749-0034 AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN IT MAY BE STATED THAT I HELD THAT THE QUESTION OF THE VALIDITY OF THE BONDS SHOULD BE DECIDED BY THE COURTS THE CONSTITUTION OF MISSISSIPPI AUTHORIZED SUIT TO BE BROUGHT AGAINST THE STATE IN SUCH CASES IN HER OWN COURTS
8786-276749-0035 AND THIS I REGARDED AS THE PROPER COURSE TO BE PURSUED BY THE BONDHOLDERS HOLDING THAT THE STATE WOULD BE BOUND BY THE JUDICIAL DECISION IF IT SHOULD SUSTAIN THE VALIDITY OF THE CLAIM THIS COURSE HOWEVER WAS NOT ADOPTED UNTIL LONG AFTERWARD
8786-276749-0036 MISTER BUCHANAN WENT TO LONDON TO PROPOSE TO THE BONDHOLDERS AN ARRANGEMENT BY WHICH THE CLAIM OR THE GREATER PORTION OF IT MIGHT BE PAID BY PRIVATE SUBSCRIPTION ON CONSIDERATION OF THE CANCELLATION OF THE BONDS
