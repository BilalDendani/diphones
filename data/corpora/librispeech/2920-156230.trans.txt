2920-156230-0000 CHAPTER THREE ELSIE'S SITUATION IT WAS NOT MERE FANCY ON JANE'S PART THAT ELSIE WAS ILL AND UNHAPPY
2920-156230-0001 SHE HAD MAGNANIMOUSLY MADE UP HER MIND TO GO TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY AND SPIRIT AND MISSUS DUNN WAS PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH HER BUT SHE MISSED JANE'S SOCIETY FAR MORE THAN HER SISTER COULD MISS HERS
2920-156230-0002 JANE WAS CONSTANTLY EMPLOYED IN OCCUPATIONS THAT DEMANDED INTELLIGENCE AND THOUGHT SHE HAD ACCESS TO BOOKS SHE WENT TO THEATRES AND PLACES OF PUBLIC AMUSEMENT EVEN MORE THAN SHE CARED FOR
2920-156230-0003 SHE HAD THE SOCIETY OF MISTER PHILLIPS CONSTANTLY AND THAT OF MISTER BRANDON AND SEVERAL OTHER AUSTRALIANS WHO WERE EITHER RETIRED ON A COMPETENCY OR HOME ON A VISIT VERY FREQUENTLY AND SHE CERTAINLY THOUGHT THEM GENERALLY PLEASANT AND INTELLIGENT
2920-156230-0004 AND MORE AGREEABLE COMPANY THAN THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE IN AND ABOUT SWINTON THEIR FRANK ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE EARLY STRUGGLES WHICH THEY HAD HAD WITH FORTUNE THE HEARTY MANNER IN WHICH THEY ENJOYED THE PROSPERITY THEY HAD EARNED
2920-156230-0005 MISTER PHILLIPS HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH SEVERAL PEOPLE FROM OTHER COLONIES THAN VICTORIA PARTLY ON BOARD SHIP AND PARTLY FROM OTHER INTRODUCTIONS A CURIOUS AND IGNORANT SUSPICION THAT SOMEHOW ALL AUSTRALIANS
2920-156230-0006 HAVE A SORT OF CONVICT ORIGIN MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT AT THAT TIME FOR THEM THAN FOR RETIRED INDIANS TO GET INTO GENERAL SOCIETY THERE WAS NO NICE DISTINCTION DRAWN BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT COLONIES BETWEEN NEW SOUTH WALES AND VICTORIA
2920-156230-0007 OR SOUTH AUSTRALIA AND TASMANIA IN THOSE DAYS A SLIGHT SAVOUR OF BOTANY BAY WAS SUPPOSED TO HANG ABOUT THEM ALL BUT THEY FORMED A PLEASANT LITTLE CLIQUE OF THEIR OWN LESS EXCLUSIVE THAN MOST CLIQUES
2920-156230-0008 AND GENERALLY DISPOSED TO HOLD UP EACH ONE HIS OWN PARTICULAR COLONY AS PREFERABLE TO THE OTHERS
2920-156230-0009 BUT AS COMPARED WITH THE OTHER COLONIES IT OUGHT TO BEAR THE PALM ELSIE FELT THE WANT OF THIS INTELLIGENCE AND THIS VARIETY OF CHARACTER THAT JANE DESCRIBED TO HER SO MINUTELY IN HER FREQUENT LETTERS
2920-156230-0010 AND REGRETTED THAT SHE COULD WRITE NOTHING INTERESTING IN RETURN WHEN SHE CAME HOME AFTER A LONG DAY'S WORK SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO TRY TO KEEP UP A LITTLE OF HER SISTER'S DISCIPLINE WITH THE LOWRIES AND WENT OVER THEIR LESSONS WITH THEM
2920-156230-0011 TOM USED TO BRING TO HER THE MOST PUZZLING QUESTIONS WHICH SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER AND MADE GREAT EFFORTS TO DO SO BUT INSTEAD OF THE INTELLECTUAL WORK REFRESHING HER AFTER THE SEDENTARY NEEDLEWORK
2920-156230-0012 SHE FELT ALL THE MORE EXHAUSTED BY IT AS FOR HER POETRY SHE APPEARED TO BE UNABLE TO WRITE A LINE AND THOUGH SHE SOMETIMES COULD READ AN OLD BOOK SHE SEEMED QUITE UNFIT TO PAY ATTENTION TO ANYTHING NEW
2920-156230-0013 SHE MISSED THE LONG WALKS SHE HAD DAILY TAKEN IN JANE'S PLEASANT COMPANY IT WAS NOT FAR FROM PEGGY'S HOUSE TO MISSUS DUNN'S PLACE OF BUSINESS AND IT WAS A VERY MONOTONOUS WALK THE WHITE REGULAR HOUSES ALL OF ONE SIZE AND HEIGHT
2920-156230-0014 WITH THEIR THOUSANDS OF WINDOWS EXACTLY ON THE SAME MODEL SEEMED ALWAYS STARING HER OUT OF COUNTENANCE AND MADE HER FEEL DEPRESSED EVEN IN THE EARLY MORNING SHE FELT THE KEEN PIERCING EAST WINDS OF AN EDINBURGH SPRING AS SHE HAD NEVER DONE AT CROSS HALL
2920-156230-0015 AND THE CONTINUED POOR LIVING AND THE HURRIED MEALS BEGAN TO TELL UPON A CONSTITUTION NATURALLY MUCH LESS ROBUST THAN JANE'S SO THAT SHE BEGAN TO LOOK PALE AND THIN AND COUGHED A GOOD DEAL AND LOST HER APPETITE
2920-156230-0016 WITH ALL THESE DRAWBACKS SHE IMPROVED SO MUCH IN TASTE AND SKILL THAT MISSUS DUNN RAISED HER WAGES OR SALARY AS SHE GENTEELLY CALLED IT AND PUT HER AT THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT IN WHICH SHE SO MUCH EXCELLED
2920-156230-0017 SO THAT SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO GIVE UP HER CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITTLE FUND THAT JANE WAS PUTTING INTO THE SAVINGS BANK MISS RENNIE HAD PERSUADED HER MAMMA TO TRY MISSUS DUNN'S ESTABLISHMENT AND HAD TOLD THAT LADY THAT IT WAS ALL ON MISS ELSIE MELVILLE'S ACCOUNT
2920-156230-0018 SO SHE OFTEN SAW HER AND LAURA WILSON THERE AND MADE BONNETS FOR BOTH OF THEM WITH HER OWN HANDS AND THE CHALMERSES AND JARDINES HAD ALSO COME TO SEE HOW ELSIE GOT ON AND OTHER PEOPLE FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF SWINTON
2920-156230-0019 ELSIE WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE HAD DEALINGS WITH SO MANY OLD ACQUAINTANCES BUT MISSUS DUNN THOUGHT IT WAS A JUST REWARD FOR HER KINDNESS THAT SHE HAD THIS INCREASE OF CUSTOM ONE DAY
2920-156230-0020 ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AFTER SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN THIS BUSINESS MISS RENNIE AND MISS WILSON CAME IN WITH MOST IMPORTANT LOOKING FACES WHILE MISS WILSON WAS BUSIED TURNING OVER THE FASHION BOOKS HER FRIEND WHISPERED TO ELSIE
