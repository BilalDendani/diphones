2319-138656-0000 A SAILOR ENTERS THE REMAINING FORTNIGHT OF THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER PASSED AWAY WITH A GENERAL DECLINE FROM THE SUMMER'S EXCITEMENTS
2319-138656-0001 THE ROYAL FAMILY LEFT THE WATERING PLACE THE FIRST WEEK IN OCTOBER THE GERMAN LEGION WITH THEIR ARTILLERY ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE DRAGOONS STILL REMAINED AT THE BARRACKS JUST OUT OF THE TOWN AND JOHN LOVEDAY BROUGHT TO ANNE EVERY NEWSPAPER THAT HE COULD LAY HANDS ON
2319-138656-0002 ESPECIALLY SUCH AS CONTAINED ANY FRAGMENT OF SHIPPING NEWS THIS THREW THEM MUCH TOGETHER AND AT THESE TIMES JOHN WAS OFTEN AWKWARD AND CONFUSED ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNWONTED STRESS OF CONCEALING HIS GREAT LOVE FOR HER
2319-138656-0003 HER INTERESTS HAD GRANDLY DEVELOPED FROM THE LIMITS OF OVERCOMBE AND THE TOWN LIFE HARD BY TO AN EXTENSIVENESS TRULY EUROPEAN DURING THE WHOLE MONTH OF OCTOBER HOWEVER NOT A SINGLE GRAIN OF INFORMATION REACHED HER OR ANYBODY ELSE
2319-138656-0004 CONCERNING NELSON AND HIS BLOCKADING SQUADRON OFF CADIZ THERE WERE THE CUSTOMARY BAD JOKES ABOUT BUONAPARTE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WAS FOUND THAT THE WHOLE FRENCH ARMY HAD TURNED ITS BACK UPON BOULOGNE AND SET OUT FOR THE RHINE
2319-138656-0005 THEN CAME ACCOUNTS OF HIS MARCH THROUGH GERMANY AND INTO AUSTRIA BUT NOT A WORD ABOUT THE VICTORY AT THE BEGINNING OF AUTUMN JOHN BROUGHT NEWS WHICH FEARFULLY DEPRESSED HER THE AUSTRIAN GENERAL MACK HAD CAPITULATED WITH HIS WHOLE ARMY
2319-138656-0006 BUT THE WEEK WHICH HAD LED OFF WITH SUCH A DREARY PIPING WAS TO END IN ANOTHER KEY ON THE VERY DAY WHEN MACK'S ARMY WAS PILING ARMS AT THE FEET OF ITS CONQUEROR A BLOW HAD BEEN STRUCK BY BOB LOVEDAY AND HIS COMRADES
2319-138656-0007 WHICH ETERNALLY SHATTERED THE ENEMY'S FORCE BY SEA FOUR DAYS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THE AUSTRIAN NEWS CORPORAL TULLIDGE RAN INTO THE MILLER'S HOUSE TO INFORM HIM THAT ON THE PREVIOUS MONDAY AT ELEVEN IN THE MORNING
2319-138656-0008 THE PICKLE SCHOONER LIEUTENANT LAPENOTIERE HAD ARRIVED AT FALMOUTH WITH DESPATCHES FROM THE FLEET THAT THE STAGE COACHES ON THE HIGHWAY THROUGH WESSEX TO LONDON WERE CHALKED WITH THE WORDS GREAT VICTORY
2319-138656-0009 GLORIOUS TRIUMPH AND SO ON AND THAT ALL THE COUNTRY PEOPLE WERE WILD TO KNOW PARTICULARS ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON JOHN ARRIVED WITH AUTHENTIC NEWS OF THE BATTLE OFF CAPE TRAFALGAR AND THE DEATH OF NELSON
2319-138656-0010 CAPTAIN HARDY WAS ALIVE THOUGH HIS ESCAPE HAD BEEN NARROW ENOUGH HIS SHOE BUCKLE HAVING BEEN CARRIED AWAY BY A SHOT IT WAS FEARED THAT THE VICTORY HAD BEEN THE SCENE OF THE HEAVIEST SLAUGHTER AMONG ALL THE SHIPS ENGAGED
2319-138656-0011 BUT AS YET NO RETURNS OF KILLED AND WOUNDED HAD BEEN ISSUED BEYOND A ROUGH LIST OF THE NUMBERS IN SOME OF THE SHIPS THE SUSPENSE OF THE LITTLE HOUSEHOLD IN OVERCOMBE MILL WAS GREAT IN THE EXTREME
2319-138656-0012 JOHN CAME THITHER DAILY FOR MORE THAN A WEEK BUT NO FURTHER PARTICULARS REACHED ENGLAND TILL THE END OF THAT TIME AND THEN ONLY THE MEAGRE INTELLIGENCE THAT THERE HAD BEEN A GALE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE BATTLE
2319-138656-0013 AND THAT MANY OF THE PRIZES HAD BEEN LOST ANNE SAID LITTLE TO ALL THESE THINGS AND PRESERVED A SUPERSTRATUM OF CALMNESS ON HER COUNTENANCE BUT SOME INNER VOICE SEEMED TO WHISPER TO HER THAT BOB WAS NO MORE
2319-138656-0014 MILLER LOVEDAY DROVE TO POS'HAM SEVERAL TIMES TO LEARN IF THE CAPTAIN'S SISTERS HAD RECEIVED ANY MORE DEFINITE TIDINGS THAN THESE FLYING REPORTS BUT THAT FAMILY HAD HEARD NOTHING WHICH COULD IN ANY WAY RELIEVE THE MILLER'S ANXIETY
2319-138656-0015 WHEN AT LAST AT THE END OF NOVEMBER THERE APPEARED A FINAL AND REVISED LIST OF KILLED AND WOUNDED AS ISSUED BY ADMIRAL COLLINGWOOD IT WAS A USELESS SHEET TO THE LOVEDAYS TO THEIR GREAT PAIN IT CONTAINED NO NAMES BUT THOSE OF OFFICERS
2319-138656-0016 WHO WOULD AVOID NEEDLESS EXPOSURE AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF THE VICTORY'S CREW HAD BEEN DISABLED OR SLAIN ANYBODY WHO HAD LOOKED INTO HER ROOM AT THIS TIME
2319-138656-0017 WAS THE OFFICE FOR THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD AT SEA BEGINNING WE THEREFORE COMMIT HIS BODY TO THE DEEP IN THESE FIRST DAYS OF DECEMBER SEVERAL OF THE VICTORIOUS FLEET CAME INTO PORT BUT NOT THE VICTORY
2319-138656-0018 MANY SUPPOSED THAT THAT NOBLE SHIP DISABLED BY THE BATTLE HAD GONE TO THE BOTTOM IN THE SUBSEQUENT TEMPESTUOUS WEATHER AND THE BELIEF WAS PERSEVERED IN TILL IT WAS TOLD IN THE TOWN AND PORT THAT SHE HAD BEEN SEEN PASSING UP THE CHANNEL
2319-138656-0019 THEN LETTERS FROM SURVIVORS BEGAN TO APPEAR IN THE PUBLIC PRINTS WHICH JOHN SO REGULARLY BROUGHT TO ANNE BUT THOUGH HE WATCHED THE MAILS WITH UNCEASING VIGILANCE THERE WAS NEVER A LETTER FROM BOB
2319-138656-0020 IT SOMETIMES CROSSED JOHN'S MIND THAT HIS BROTHER MIGHT STILL BE ALIVE AND WELL AND THAT IN HIS WISH TO ABIDE BY HIS EXPRESSED INTENTION OF GIVING UP ANNE AND HOME LIFE HE WAS DELIBERATELY LAX IN WRITING
2319-138656-0021 IT WAS A CLEAR DAY IN DECEMBER THE FIRST SLIGHT SNOW OF THE SEASON HAD BEEN SIFTED OVER THE EARTH AND ONE SIDE OF THE APPLE TREE BRANCHES IN THE MILLER'S GARDEN WAS TOUCHED WITH WHITE
2319-138656-0022 THOUGH A FEW LEAVES WERE STILL LINGERING ON THE TOPS OF THE YOUNGER TREES A SHORT SAILOR OF THE ROYAL NAVY WHO WAS NOT BOB NOR ANYTHING LIKE HIM CROSSED THE MILL COURT AND CAME TO THE DOOR
2319-138656-0023 THE MILLER HASTENED OUT AND BROUGHT HIM INTO THE ROOM WHERE JOHN MISSUS LOVEDAY AND ANNE GARLAND WERE ALL PRESENT I'M FROM ABOARD THE VICTORY SAID THE SAILOR MY NAME'S JIM CORNICK AND YOUR LAD IS ALIVE AND WELL
2319-138656-0024 THEY BREATHED RATHER THAN SPOKE THEIR THANKFULNESS AND RELIEF THE MILLER'S EYES BEING MOIST AS HE TURNED ASIDE TO CALM HIMSELF WHILE ANNE HAVING FIRST JUMPED UP WILDLY FROM HER SEAT SANK BACK AGAIN
2319-138656-0025 UNDER THE ALMOST INSUPPORTABLE JOY THAT TREMBLED THROUGH HER LIMBS TO HER UTMOST FINGER I'VE COME FROM SPITHEAD TO POS'HAM THE SAILOR CONTINUED AND NOW I AM GOING ON TO FATHER AT BUDMOUTH AH

2319-138656-0027 LOVEDAY THEN BUSTLED OFF TO DRAW THE VISITOR SOMETHING TO DRINK ANNE GARLAND WITH A GLOWING BLUSH ON HER FACE HAD GONE TO THE BACK PART OF THE ROOM WHERE SHE WAS THE VERY EMBODIMENT OF SWEET CONTENT AS SHE SLIGHTLY SWAYED HERSELF WITHOUT SPEAKING
2319-138656-0028 A LITTLE TIDE OF HAPPINESS SEEMED TO EBB AND FLOW THROUGH HER IN LISTENING TO THE SAILOR'S WORDS MOVING HER FIGURE WITH IT THE SEAMAN AND JOHN WENT ON CONVERSING
2319-138656-0029 BUT WHAT IT WAS I DON'T KNOW FOR I WAS QUARTERED AT A GUN SOME WAYS OFF

2319-138656-0031 FOR THE WIND HAD DROPPED AND THE SMOKE WAS LIKE A CLOUD BUT A GOT A GOOD DEAL TALKED ABOUT AND THEY SAY THERE'S PROMOTION IN STORE FOR'N AT THIS POINT IN THE STORY JIM CORNICK STOPPED TO DRINK
2319-138656-0032 AND A LOW UNCONSCIOUS HUMMING CAME FROM ANNE IN HER DISTANT CORNER THE FAINT MELODY CONTINUED MORE OR LESS WHEN THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE SAILOR AND THE LOVEDAYS WAS RENEWED WE HEARD AFORE THAT THE VICTORY WAS NEAR KNOCKED TO PIECES SAID THE MILLER
