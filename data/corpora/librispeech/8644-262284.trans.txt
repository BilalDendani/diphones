8644-262284-0000 THE LETTER CONTAINING THE BANK NOTE HAD BEEN DESPATCHED TO MISTER ROBERT GALLOWAY AT VENTNOR ON THE FRIDAY ON THE SUNDAY MORNING WHILE MISTER GALLOWAY WAS AT BREAKFAST A SHORT ANSWER WAS DELIVERED TO HIM FROM HIS COUSIN YOUR LETTER HAS REACHED ME
8644-262284-0001 BUT NOT THE NOTE YOU MUST HAVE OMITTED TO ENCLOSE IT WAS THE NEWS IT CONTAINED RELATIVE TO THAT PARTICULAR POINT MISTER GALLOWAY KNEW THAT HE HAD ENCLOSED THE NOTE THERE WAS LITTLE DOUBT THAT BOTH HIS CLERKS COULD TESTIFY THAT HE HAD DONE SO
8644-262284-0002 HOW COULD IT HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT AGAIN HAD IT BEEN ABSTRACTED WHILE THE LETTER WAS STILL IN HIS OFFICE OR ON ITS WAY TO THE POST OR IN ITS TRANSMISSION TO VENTNOR IF IN THE OFFICE ARGUED MISTER GALLOWAY IT MUST HAVE BEEN DONE BEFORE I SEALED IT
8644-262284-0003 IF AFTERWARDS THAT SEAL MUST HAVE BEEN TAMPERED WITH PROBABLY BROKEN I'LL DROP A NOTE TO ROBERT AND ASK THE QUESTION HE ROSE FROM HIS BREAKFAST AND PENNED A LINE TO SOUTHAMPTON WHERE AS HE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE
8644-262284-0004 IT WAS NOT MISTER GALLOWAY'S HABIT TO WRITE LETTERS ON A SUNDAY BUT HE CONSIDERED THAT THE PRESENT OCCASION JUSTIFIED THE ACT I CERTAINLY ENCLOSED THE NOTE IN MY LETTER HE WROTE SEND ME WORD INSTANTLY WHETHER THE SEAL HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH
8644-262284-0005 I STAMPED IT WITH MY PRIVATE SEAL MISTER ROBERT GALLOWAY RECEIVED THIS ON THE MONDAY MORNING HE DID NOT WAIT FOR THE POST BUT FORWARDED THE REPLY BY TELEGRAPH
8644-262284-0006 THIS WAS THE DESPATCH WHICH YOU SAW MISTER GALLOWAY RECEIVE IN HIS OFFICE HE WENT BACK INTO HIS PRIVATE ROOM CARRYING THE DESPATCH WITH HIM AND THERE HE SAT DOWN TO THINK
8644-262284-0007 FROM THE VERY FIRST HE HAD NOT BELIEVED THE FRAUD TO LIE WITH THE POST OFFICE FOR THIS REASON HAD THE NOTE BEEN TAKEN OUT BY ONE OF ITS SERVANTS THE LETTER WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT HAVE REACHED ITS DESTINATION IT WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED WITH THE NOTE
8644-262284-0008 HE HAD CAST A DOUBT UPON WHETHER ARTHUR CHANNING HAD POSTED THE LETTERS HIMSELF ARTHUR ASSURED HIM THAT HE HAD DONE SO AND MISTER GALLOWAY BELIEVED HIM
8644-262284-0009 THE INFORMATION THAT THE SEAL OF THE LETTER WAS UNBROKEN WAS NOW A FURTHER CONFIRMATION HAD HE NEEDED IT AT LEAST IT CONFIRMED THAT THE LETTER HAD NOT BEEN OPENED AFTER IT LEFT THE OFFICE MISTER GALLOWAY PERFECTLY REMEMBERED FASTENING DOWN THE LETTER
8644-262284-0010 AND SO FAR AS HE BELIEVED THAT THE ABSTRACTION HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THE TIME OF HIS FASTENING DOWN THE ENVELOPE AND OF HIS SEALING IT WHO HAD DONE IT I'LL LAY A GUINEA I KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED HE EXCLAIMED TO HIMSELF
8644-262284-0011 CHANNING WAS AT COLLEGE I MUST HAVE GIVEN HIM PERMISSION IN A SOFT MOMENT TO TAKE THAT ORGAN OR I SHOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT QUITTING THE OFFICE DAILY AND YORKE IN HIS INDOLENT CARELESSNESS MUST HAVE GOT GOSSIPING OUTSIDE LEAVING IT
8644-262284-0012 IS HARD TO SAY WHO IN THE OFFICE THIS COMES OF POOR JENKINS'S FALL
8644-262284-0013 SEND MISTER ARTHUR CHANNING IN SAID MISTER GALLOWAY ARTHUR ENTERED IN OBEDIENCE MISTER GALLOWAY SIGNED TO HIM TO CLOSE THE DOOR AND THEN SPOKE THIS IS AN AWKWARD BUSINESS CHANNING VERY AWKWARD INDEED SIR
8644-262284-0014 REPLIED ARTHUR AT NO LOSS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MISTER GALLOWAY ALLUDED TO I DO NOT SEE THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THE NOTE TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM THE LETTER EXCEPT IN ITS TRANSMISSION THROUGH THE POST I TELL YOU IT WAS TAKEN FROM IT BEFORE IT LEFT THIS OFFICE
8644-262284-0015 TARTLY RETURNED MISTER GALLOWAY I HAVE MY REASONS FOR THE ASSERTION DID YOU SEE ME PUT THE BANK NOTE INTO THE LETTER OF COURSE I DID SIR I WAS STANDING BY WHEN YOU DID IT I REMAINED BY YOU AFTER BRINGING YOU THE NOTE FROM THIS ROOM
8644-262284-0016 I ENCLOSED THE NOTE AND FASTENED DOWN THE ENVELOPE SAID MISTER GALLOWAY POINTING THE FEATHER OF HIS QUILL PEN AT EACH PROPOSITION I DID NOT SEAL IT THEN BECAUSE LOOKING AT MAD NANCE HINDERED ME AND I WENT OUT
8644-262284-0017 LEAVING THE LETTER ON JENKINS'S DESK IN YOUR CHARGE AND YORKE'S YES SIR I PLACED THE LETTER IN THE RACK IN YOUR ROOM IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS AND PRAY WHAT LOOSE ACQUAINTANCES DID YOU AND YORKE RECEIVE HERE THAT AFTERNOON
8644-262284-0018 I DO NOT KNOW WHEN THE OFFICE HAS BEEN SO FREE FROM CALLERS NO PERSON WHATEVER ENTERED IT EXCEPT MY BROTHER HAMISH THAT'S ALL NONSENSE SAID MISTER GALLOWAY YOU ARE GETTING TO SPEAK AS INCAUTIOUSLY AS YORKE
8644-262284-0019 HOW CAN YOU TELL WHO CAME HERE WHEN YOU WERE AT COLLEGE YORKE WOULD BE ALONE THEN NO YORKE WAS NOT ARTHUR WAS BEGINNING BUT HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AND HESITATED
8644-262284-0020 HE DID NOT CARE TO TELL MISTER GALLOWAY THAT YORKE HAD PLAYED TRUANT ALL THAT AFTERNOON MISTER GALLOWAY SAW HIS HESITATION AND DID NOT LIKE IT COME WHAT HAVE YOU TO CONCEAL YOU AND YORKE HELD A LEVEE HERE I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE FACT
8644-262284-0021 YOU HAD SO MANY FELLOWS IN HERE GOSSIPING THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHO MAY HAVE MEDDLED WITH THE LETTER AND WHEN YOU WERE OFF TO COLLEGE THEY STAYED ON WITH YORKE NO SIR
8644-262284-0022 FOR ONE THING I DID NOT TAKE THE ORGAN THAT AFTERNOON I WENT AS USUAL BUT MISTER WILLIAMS WAS THERE HIMSELF SO I CAME BACK AT ONCE I WAS ONLY AWAY ABOUT TEN MINUTES AND HOW MANY DID YOU FIND WITH YORKE
8644-262284-0023 STEPPED OUT TO SPEAK TO SOME ONE JUST BEFORE I WENT TO COLLEGE REPLIED ARTHUR OBLIGED TO ALLUDE TO IT BUT DETERMINED TO SAY AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE HAMISH WAS HERE SIR YOU MET HIM COMING IN AS YOU WERE GOING OUT AND I GOT HIM TO STAY IN THE OFFICE TILL I RETURNED
8644-262284-0024 PRETTY DOINGS RETORTED MISTER GALLOWAY HINDERING THE TIME OF MISTER HAMISH CHANNING THAT YOU AND YORKE MAY KICK UP YOUR HEELS ELSEWHERE NICE TRUSTWORTHY CLERKS BOTH OF YOU I WAS OBLIGED TO GO TO COLLEGE SIR SAID ARTHUR IN A TONE OF DEPRECATION
8644-262284-0025 WAS YORKE OBLIGED TO GO OUT I WAS BACK AGAIN VERY SHORTLY I ASSURE YOU SIR SAID ARTHUR PASSING OVER THE REMARK AND I DID NOT LEAVE THE OFFICE AGAIN UNTIL YOU SENT ME TO THE POST STOP SAID MISTER GALLOWAY
8644-262284-0026 LET ME CLEARLY UNDERSTAND AS I WENT OUT HAMISH CAME IN THEN YOU SAY YORKE WENT OUT AND YOU TO GET TO COLLEGE LEFT HAMISH KEEPING OFFICE DID ANY ONE ELSE COME IN BESIDES HAMISH NOT ANY ONE
8644-262284-0027 WHEN I RETURNED FROM COLLEGE I INQUIRED OF HAMISH WHO HAD CALLED AND HE SAID NO ONE HAD CALLED THEN LADY AUGUSTA YORKE DROVE UP AND HAMISH WENT AWAY WITH HER SHE WAS GOING TO THE MISSIONARY MEETING
8644-262284-0028 AND YOU PERSIST IN SAYING THAT NO ONE CAME IN AFTER THAT NO ONE DID COME IN SIR VERY WELL SEND YORKE TO ME
8644-262284-0029 ROLAND MADE HIS APPEARANCE A PEN BEHIND HIS EAR AND A RULER IN HIS HAND MORE SHOW THAN WORK SARCASTICALLY EXCLAIMED MISTER GALLOWAY NOW SIR I HAVE BEEN QUESTIONING MISTER ARTHUR CHANNING ABOUT THIS UNPLEASANT BUSINESS
8644-262284-0030 FOR I AM DETERMINED TO COME TO THE BOTTOM OF IT I CAN GET NOTHING SATISFACTORY FROM HIM SO I MUST TRY WHAT I CAN DO WITH YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS TO TELL ME HOW YOU SPENT YOUR TIME ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON ON FRIDAY
8644-262284-0031 BEGAN ROLAND OUT OF HIS WITS WITH PERPLEXITY AS TO HOW HE SHOULD CONCEAL HIS AFTERNOON'S ABSENCE FROM MISTER GALLOWAY IT'S DIFFICULT TO RECOLLECT WHAT ONE DOES ON ONE PARTICULAR DAY
8644-262284-0032 PERHAPS TO BEGIN WITH YOU CAN REMEMBER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY ENCLOSING THE BANK NOTE IN THE LETTER I WENT INTO THE OTHER ROOM TO CONSULT A BRADSHAW' I REMEMBER THAT QUITE WELL SIR INTERRUPTED ROLAND
8644-262284-0033 AND YOU PUT IT INTO THE ENVELOPE IT WAS JUST BEFORE WE WERE ALL CALLED TO THE WINDOW BY MAD NANCE AFTER THAT PURSUED MISTER GALLOWAY
8644-262284-0034 AND HAMISH CHANNING CAME IN WHO ELSE CAME IN I DON'T REMEMBER ANY ONE ELSE ANSWERED ROLAND WISHING SOME ONE WOULD COME IN THEN AND STOP THE QUESTIONING NO SUCH LUCK HOWEVER
8644-262284-0035 HOW MANY PEOPLE CALLED IN WHILE CHANNING WAS AT COLLEGE AND YOU WERE KEEPING OFFICE DEMANDED MISTER GALLOWAY ROLAND FIDGETED FIRST ON ONE LEG THEN ON THE OTHER HE FELT THAT IT MUST ALL COME OUT WHAT A PASSION HE'LL GO INTO WITH ME THOUGHT ROLAND
8644-262284-0036 IT IS CERTAIN THAT NO ONE CAN HAVE TOUCHED THE BANK NOTE IN THIS OFFICE SIR HE SAID ALOUD THOSE POOR HALF STARVED POSTMEN MUST HAVE HELPED THEMSELVES TO IT WHEN I ASK FOR YOUR OPINION UPON WHO HAS HELPED THEMSELVES TO IT IT WILL BE TIME ENOUGH TO GIVE IT ME
8644-262284-0037 RETURNED MISTER GALLOWAY DRILY I SAY THAT THE MONEY WAS TAKEN FROM THE LETTER BEFORE IT LEFT THIS OFFICE WHEN IT WAS UNDER THE CHARGE OF YOU AND CHANNING I HOPE YOU DO NOT SUSPECT US OF TAKING IT SIR SAID ROLAND GOING INTO A HEAT
8644-262284-0038 COULD THE BANK NOTE DROP OUT OF THE LETTER OF ITSELF I SUPPOSE IT COULD NOT SIR GOOD THEN IT IS MY BUSINESS TO ASCERTAIN IF I CAN HOW IT DID GET OUT OF IT YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED MY QUESTION WHO CAME INTO THIS OFFICE
8644-262284-0039 WHILE CHANNING WAS AT THE CATHEDRAL ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON I DECLARE NOBODY EVER HAD SUCH LUCK AS I BURST FORTH ROLAND IN A TONE HALF COMIC HALF DEFIANT AS HE FELT HE MUST MAKE A MERIT OF NECESSITY AND CONFESS
8644-262284-0040 LAST FRIDAY AFTERNOON DURING CHANNING'S HOUR FOR COLLEGE WHAT NOT AT ALL EXCLAIMED MISTER GALLOWAY WHO HAD NOT SUSPECTED THAT YORKE WAS ABSENT SO LONG AS I SAY IT'S MY LUCK TO BE FOUND OUT
8644-262284-0041 AND I AM SORRY TO SAY I WAS SEDUCED INTO STOPPING OUT WITH HIM LONGER THAN I OUGHT TO HAVE DONE MISTER GALLOWAY STARED AT ROLAND AT WHAT TIME DID YOU GO OUT HE ASKED JUST AFTER YOU DID SIR THE BELL WAS GOING FOR COLLEGE
8644-262284-0042 AND PRAY WHAT TIME DID YOU COME IN AGAIN WELL SIR YOU SAW ME COME IN IT WAS GETTING ON FOR FIVE O'CLOCK DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU HAD NOT BEEN IN AT ALL BETWEEN THOSE HOURS IT WAS KNIVETT'S FAULT GRUMBLED ROLAND HE KEPT ME
8644-262284-0043 MISTER GALLOWAY SAT DRUMMING ON HIS DESK APPARENTLY GAZING AT ROLAND IN REALITY THINKING TO HEAR THAT MISTER ROLAND YORKE HAD TAKEN FRENCH LEAVE FOR NEARLY A WHOLE AFTERNOON
8644-262284-0044 JUST ON THE ESPECIAL AFTERNOON THAT HE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE TAKEN IT JENKINS BEING AWAY DID NOT SURPRISE HIM IN THE LEAST IT WAS VERY MUCH IN THE LINE OF THE YORKES TO DO SO
8644-262284-0045 SINCE HE WAS SURE TO DO IT AGAIN THE VERY NEXT TIME THE TEMPTATION OFFERED ITSELF FAILING TEMPTATION HE WOULD REMAIN AT HIS POST STEADILY ENOUGH NO IT WAS NOT ROLAND'S ESCAPADE THAT MISTER GALLOWAY WAS CONSIDERING
8644-262284-0046 BUT THE VERY NARROW RADIUS THAT THE AFFAIR OF THE LETTER APPEARED TO BE DRAWING ITSELF INTO IF ROLAND WAS ABSENT HE COULD NOT HAVE HAD HALF THE TOWN IN TO CHATTER AND IF ARTHUR CHANNING ASSERTED THAT NONE HAD BEEN IN MISTER GALLOWAY COULD GIVE CREDENCE TO ARTHUR
8644-262284-0047 BUT THEN HOW HAD THE MONEY DISAPPEARED WHO HAD TAKEN IT CHANNING HE CALLED OUT LOUDLY AND SHARPLY ARTHUR WHO WAS PREPARING TO ATTEND THE CATHEDRAL FOR THE BELL HAD RUNG OUT HASTENED IN
8644-262284-0048 HOW CAME YOU NOT TO TELL ME WHEN WE WERE SPEAKING OF ROLAND YORKE'S ABSENCE THAT HE REMAINED AWAY ALL THE AFTERNOON QUESTIONED MISTER GALLOWAY
8644-262284-0049 ARTHUR WAS SILENT HE GLANCED ONCE AT ROLAND WELL CRIED MISTER GALLOWAY IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO TELL YOU HIMSELF SIR AS I CONCLUDE HE HAS NOW DONE
8644-262284-0050 THE FACT IS YOU ARE TWO BIRDS OF A FEATHER STORMED MISTER GALLOWAY WHO WHEN ONCE ROUSED WHICH WAS NOT OFTEN WOULD SAY ANYTHING THAT CAME UPPERMOST JUST OR UNJUST THE ONE WON'T TELL TALES OF THE OTHER IF
8644-262284-0051 THE OTHER WOULD STICK TO IT IS IT TRUE SIR THAT HE WAS NOT AT THE OFFICE DURING MY ABSENCE FROM IT ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON HE CONTINUED TO ARTHUR THAT IS TRUE
8644-262284-0052 KEEP QUIET ROLAND YORKE INTERRUPTED THAT GENTLEMAN I DO NOT SUSPECT YOU OF TAKING IT
8644-262284-0053 YOU KNOW FOR YOU CALL PLENTY OF THEM FRIENDS BUT IF YOU WERE ABSENT YOURSELF THAT SUSPICION FALLS TO THE GROUND AGAIN I SAY WHO CAN HAVE TAKEN THE MONEY
8644-262284-0054 IT IS AN UTTER IMPOSSIBILITY THAT YORKE COULD HAVE TAKEN IT EVEN WERE HE CAPABLE OF SUCH A THING GENEROUSLY SPOKE ARTHUR FROM THE TIME YOU LEFT THE OFFICE YOURSELF SIR UNTIL AFTER THE LETTERS WERE TAKEN OUT OF IT TO BE POSTED HE WAS AWAY FROM IT
8644-262284-0055 JUST LIKE HIM EXCLAIMED MISTER GALLOWAY IT MUST HAVE BEEN DONE WHILE YOUR BROTHER HAMISH WAS WAITING IN THE OFFICE WE MUST ASCERTAIN FROM HIM WHO CAME IN HE TOLD ME NO ONE CAME IN REPEATED ARTHUR RUBBISH
8644-262284-0056 TESTILY OBSERVED MISTER GALLOWAY SOME ONE MUST HAVE COME IN SOME ONE WITH LIGHT FINGERS TOO THE MONEY COULD NOT GO WITHOUT HANDS YOU ARE OFF TO COLLEGE NOW I SUPPOSE CHANNING YES SIR WHEN SERVICE IS OVER
8644-262284-0057 JUST GO DOWN AS FAR AS YOUR BROTHER'S OFFICE AND ASK HIM ABOUT IT HE IS AS OBSTINATE AS ANY OLD ADDER EXCLAIMED ROLAND YORKE TO ARTHUR WHEN THEY LEFT MISTER GALLOWAY ALONE THE ONLY POSSIBLE WAY IN WHICH IT CAN HAVE GONE IS THROUGH THAT POST OFFICE
8644-262284-0058 THE MEN HAVE FORKED IT AS THEY DID LADY AUGUSTA'S PILLS HE SAYS IT WAS NOT THE POST OFFICE MUSED ARTHUR HE SAID AS I UNDERSTOOD THAT THE TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCH PROVED TO HIM THAT IT HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT HERE
8644-262284-0059 HOW COULD A DESPATCH TELL HIM WHO TOOK IT OR WHO DID NOT UNLESS IT WAS A DESPATCH FROM THOSE SPIRIT RAPPERS MESMERISTS OR WHATEVER THEY CALL THEMSELVES THEY PROFESS TO SHOW YOU WHO YOUR GRANDMOTHER WAS IF YOU DON'T KNOW ROLAND LAUGHED AS HE SPOKE
8644-262284-0060 ARTHUR WAS NOT INCLINED FOR JOKING THE AFFAIR PERPLEXED HIM IN NO ORDINARY DEGREE I WISH MISTER GALLOWAY WOULD MENTION HIS GROUNDS FOR THINKING THE NOTE WAS TAKEN BEFORE IT WENT TO THE POST HE SAID HE OUGHT TO MENTION THEM CRIED ROLAND FIERCELY
8644-262284-0061 HE SAYS HE LEARNS BY THE DESPATCH THAT THE LETTER WAS NOT OPENED AFTER IT LEFT THIS OFFICE NOW IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT ANY DESPATCH COULD TELL HIM THAT
8644-262284-0062 WHAT DID THE DESPATCH SAY WHO SENT IT WOULD IT AFFORD YOU SATISFACTION TO KNOW MISTER ROLAND AND ROLAND WHEELED ROUND WITH A START FOR IT WAS THE VOICE OF MISTER GALLOWAY HE HAD FOLLOWED THEM INTO THE FRONT OFFICE AND CAUGHT THE LATTER PART OF THE CONVERSATION
8644-262284-0063 COME SIR HE ADDED I WILL TEACH YOU A LESSON IN CAUTION WHEN I HAVE SEALED LETTERS THAT CONTAINED MONEY AFTER THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY FASTENED DOWN WITH GUM
8644-262284-0064 I HAVE SEEN YOU THROW YOUR HEAD BACK MISTER ROLAND WITH THAT FAVOURITE SCORNFUL MOVEMENT OF YOURS AS IF GUM DID NOT STICK THEM FAST ENOUGH YOU HAVE SAID IN YOUR HEART BUT NOW THE FACT OF MY HAVING SEALED THIS LETTER IN QUESTION
8644-262284-0065 ENABLES ME TO SAY THAT THE LETTER WAS NOT OPENED AFTER IT LEFT MY HANDS THE DESPATCH YOU ARE SO CURIOUS ABOUT WAS FROM MY COUSIN TELLING ME THAT THE SEAL REACHED HIM INTACT
8644-262284-0066 I DID NOT KNOW THE LETTER WAS SEALED REMARKED ROLAND BUT THAT PROVES NOTHING SIR THEY MIGHT MELT THE WAX AND SEAL IT UP AGAIN EVERY ONE KEEPS A STAMP OF THIS SORT HE ADDED STRETCHING HIS HAND OUT FOR THE SEAL USUALLY USED IN THE OFFICE AN ORDINARY CROSS BARRED WAFER STAMP
8644-262284-0067 WITH MY OWN PRIVATE SEAL THAT ALTERS THE CASE OF COURSE SAID ROLAND AFTER A PAUSE SIR I WISH YOU WOULD SET ME TO WORK TO FIND OUT HE IMPULSIVELY CONTINUED I'D GO TO THE POST OFFICE AND
8644-262284-0068 AND THERE MAKE ENOUGH NOISE FOR TEN AND DEFEAT YOUR OWN ENDS INTERRUPTED MISTER GALLOWAY
