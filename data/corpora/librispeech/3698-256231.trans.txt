3698-256231-0000 SOME DAYS LATER PRINCE RAMESES WAS SUMMONED BEFORE THE FACE OF HIS MOST WORTHY MOTHER NIKOTRIS WHO WAS THE SECOND WIFE OF THE PHARAOH BUT NOW THE GREATEST LADY IN EGYPT THE GODS WERE NOT MISTAKEN WHEN THEY CALLED HER TO BE THE MOTHER OF A PHARAOH
3698-256231-0001 SHE WAS A TALL PERSON OF RATHER FULL HABIT AND IN SPITE OF FORTY YEARS WAS STILL BEAUTIFUL THERE WAS IN HER EYES FACE AND WHOLE FORM SUCH MAJESTY THAT EVEN WHEN SHE WENT UNATTENDED IN THE MODEST GARB OF A PRIESTESS
3698-256231-0002 PEOPLE BOWED THEIR HEADS TO HER THE WORTHY LADY RECEIVED RAMESES IN HER CABINET WHICH WAS PAVED WITH PORCELAIN TILES SHE SAT ON AN INLAID ARMCHAIR UNDER A PALM TREE AT HER FEET ON A SMALL STOOL
3698-256231-0003 LAY A LITTLE DOG ON THE OTHER SIDE KNELT A BLACK SLAVE WOMAN WITH A FAN THE PHARAOH'S WIFE WORE A MUSLIN ROBE EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD AND ON HER WIG A CIRCLET IN THE FORM OF A LOTUS ORNAMENTED WITH JEWELS
3698-256231-0004 WHEN THE PRINCE HAD BOWED LOW THE LITTLE DOG SNIFFED HIM THEN LAY DOWN AGAIN WHILE THE LADY NODDING HER HEAD MADE INQUIRY FOR WHAT REASON O RAMESES HAST THOU DESIRED AN INTERVIEW TWO DAYS AGO MOTHER
3698-256231-0005 RAMESES DROPPED HIS HEAD HE WAS CONFUSED BUT DOST THOU NEED MUCH MONEY FIFTEEN TALENTS O GODS CRIED THE LADY BUT A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO TEN TALENTS WERE PAID THEE FROM THE TREASURY
3698-256231-0006 GO GIRL INTO THE GARDEN THOU MUST BE TIRED SAID SHE TO THE BLACK SLAVE AND WHEN ALONE WITH HER SON SHE ASKED BUT IS THY JEWESS SO DEMANDING RAMESES BLUSHED BUT RAISED HIS HEAD
3698-256231-0007 THOU KNOWEST MOTHER THAT SHE IS NOT BUT I PROMISED A REWARD TO THE ARMY AND I AM UNABLE TO PAY IT THE QUEEN LOOKED AT HIM WITH CALM LOFTINESS

3698-256231-0009 SHE PLEASED ME THERE IS NOT SUCH A BEAUTY AMONG THY SERVING MAIDENS MOTHER NOR EVEN AMONG THE WIVES OF HIS HOLINESS BUT SHE IS A JEWESS BE NOT PREJUDICED MOTHER I BEG OF THEE IT IS UNTRUE THAT JEWS EAT PORK AND KILL CATS
3698-256231-0010 THE WORTHY LADY LAUGHED THOU ART SPEAKING LIKE SOME BOY FROM A PRIMARY SCHOOL ANSWERED SHE SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS AND HAST FORGOTTEN THE WORDS OF RAMESES THE GREAT THE YELLOW PEOPLE ARE MORE NUMEROUS THAN WE AND THEY ARE RICHER
3698-256231-0011 LET US ACT AGAINST THEM LEST THEY GROW TOO POWERFUL BUT LET US ACT CAREFULLY I DO NOT THINK THEREFORE THAT A GIRL OF THAT PEOPLE IS THE ONE TO BE FIRST MISTRESS OF THE HEIR TO THE THRONE
3698-256231-0012 CAN THE WORDS OF RAMESES THE GREAT APPLY TO THE DAUGHTER OF A POOR TENANT ASKED THE PRINCE BESIDES WHERE ARE THE JEWS THREE CENTURIES AGO THEY LEFT EGYPT AND TO DAY THEY FORM A LITTLE STATE RIDICULOUS AND PRIEST GOVERNED
3698-256231-0013 I SEE ANSWERED THE WORTHY LADY FROWNING SLIGHTLY THAT THY MISTRESS IS NOT LOSING TIME BE CAREFUL RAMESES REMEMBER THAT THEIR LEADER WAS MESSU MOSES THAT TRAITOR PRIEST WHOM WE CURSE TO THIS DAY IN OUR TEMPLES
3698-256231-0014 REMEMBER THAT THE JEWS BORE AWAY OUT OF EGYPT MORE TREASURES THAN THE LABOR OF THEIR FEW GENERATIONS WAS WORTH TO US THEY TOOK WITH THEM NOT ONLY GOLD BUT THE FAITH IN ONE GOD AND OUR SACRED LAWS WHICH THEY GIVE OUT TO DAY AS THEIR OWN FAITH AND LAWS
3698-256231-0015 LAST OF ALL KNOW THIS ADDED SHE WITH GREAT EMPHASIS THAT THE DAUGHTERS OF THAT PEOPLE PREFER DEATH TO THE BED OF A FOREIGNER AND IF THEY GIVE THEMSELVES EVEN TO HOSTILE LEADERS
3698-256231-0016 IT IS TO USE THEM FOR THEIR POLICY OR TO KILL THEM BELIEVE ME MOTHER THAT IT IS OUR PRIESTS WHO SPREAD ALL THESE REPORTS THEY WILL NOT ADMIT TO THE FOOTSTOOL OF THE THRONE PEOPLE OF ANOTHER FAITH
3698-256231-0017 LEST THOSE PEOPLE MIGHT SERVE THE PHARAOH IN OPPOSITION TO THEIR ORDER THE QUEEN ROSE FROM THE ARMCHAIR AND CROSSING HER ARMS ON HER BREAST GAZED AT HER SON WITH AMAZEMENT WHAT THEY TELL ME IS TRUE THEN
3698-256231-0018 WAS A HIGH PRIEST AND POSSESSED EXTENSIVE POWER IN THIS COUNTRY JUST BECAUSE MY GRANDFATHER WAS A PHARAOH AND MY FATHER IS A PHARAOH ALSO I CANNOT ENDURE THE RULE OF HERHOR
3698-256231-0019 I CANNOT RECOGNIZE MY OWN SON I DO NOT SEE IN THEE THE FUTURE LORD OF EGYPT THE DYNASTY IN THY PERSON WILL BE LIKE A NILE BOAT WITHOUT A RUDDER THOU WILT DRIVE THE PRIESTS FROM THE COURT BUT WHO WILL REMAIN WITH THEE
3698-256231-0020 WHO WILL BE THY EYE IN THE LOWER AND THE UPPER COUNTRY WHO IN FOREIGN LANDS BUT THE PHARAOH MUST SEE EVERYTHING WHATEVER IT BE ON WHICH FALL THE DIVINE RAYS OF OSIRIS THE PRIESTS WILL BE MY SERVANTS NOT MY MINISTERS
