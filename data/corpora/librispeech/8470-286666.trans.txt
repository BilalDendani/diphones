8470-286666-0000 THE BIGGEST FROG AWAKENS THE BIGGEST FROG STRETCHED THE FOUR TOES OF HIS RIGHT FOREFOOT THEN HE STRETCHED THE FOUR TOES OF HIS LEFT FOREFOOT
8470-286666-0001 THEN HE STRETCHED ALL SEVENTEEN TOES AT ONCE HE SHOULD HAVE HAD EIGHTEEN TOES TO STRETCH LIKE HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS BUT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO THE EIGHTEENTH ONE A GREAT MANY YEARS BEFORE
8470-286666-0002 NONE OF THE POND PEOPLE KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO IT BUT SOMETHING HAD
8470-286666-0003 HE ONLY STARED AT THEM WITH HIS GREAT EYES AND SAID MY CHILDREN THAT STORY IS TOO SAD TO TELL AFTER THE BIGGEST FROG HAD STRETCHED ALL HIS TOES HE STRETCHED HIS LEGS AND TWITCHED HIS LIPS
8470-286666-0004 HE POKED HIS HEAD OUT OF THE MUD A VERY VERY LITTLE WAY AND SAW A MINNOW SWIMMING PAST GOOD DAY SAID HE IS IT TIME TO GET UP
8470-286666-0005 I SHOULD SAY IT WAS WHY THE WATERCRESS IS GROWING NOW EVERY ONE WHO LIVES IN A POND KNOWS THAT WHEN THE WATERCRESS BEGINS TO GROW IT IS TIME FOR ALL THE WINTER SLEEPERS TO AWAKEN
8470-286666-0006 THE BIGGEST FROG CRAWLED OUT OF THE MUD AND POKED THIS WAY AND THAT ALL AROUND THE SPOT WHERE HE HAD SPENT THE COLD WEATHER WAKE UP HE SAID WAKE UP WAKE UP
8470-286666-0007 THE WATER GREW DARK AND CLOUDY BECAUSE HE KICKED UP SO MUCH MUD
8470-286666-0008 SEVEN OF THEM HAD HUDDLED CLOSE TO HIM ALL WINTER COME OUT HE CRIED THE SPRING IS HERE AND IT IS NO TIME FOR FROGS TO BE ASLEEP ASLEEP NO INDEED EXCLAIMED HIS SISTER
8470-286666-0009 AN ELDERLY AND HARD WORKING FROG AS SHE SWAM TO THE SHORE AND CRAWLED OUT ON IT
8470-286666-0010 THE YOUNGER FROGS FOLLOWED THROUGH THE WARMER SHALLOW WATER UNTIL THEY WERE PARTLY OUT OF IT
8470-286666-0011 ALL THE YOUNG FROGS THOUGHT HOW FINE IT WOULD BE TO BECOME THE BIGGEST FROG OF EVEN A VERY SMALL PUDDLE FOR THEN THEY COULD TELL THE OTHERS WHAT TO DO NOW THEY LOOKED AT THEIR LEADER AND EACH SAID TO HIMSELF PERHAPS
8470-286666-0012 THE BIGGEST FROG FOUND A COMFORTABLE PLACE AND SAT DOWN HE TOED IN WITH HIS EIGHT FRONT TOES AS WELL BRED FROGS DO AND ALL HIS FRIENDS TOED IN WITH THEIR EIGHT FRONT TOES HE TOED OUT WITH HIS NINE BACK TOES
8470-286666-0013 AND ALL HIS FRIENDS TOED OUT WITH THEIR TEN BACK TOES ONE YOUNG YELLOW BROWN FROG
8470-286666-0014 IT IS SO IN THE WAY BESIDES THERE IS SUCH A STYLE ABOUT HAVING ONE'S HIND FEET DIFFERENT HE SPOKE JUST LOUD ENOUGH FOR THE BIGGEST FROG TO HEAR ANY ONE WOULD KNOW FROM THIS REMARK
8470-286666-0015 THAT HE WAS YOUNG AND FOOLISH FOR WHEN PEOPLE ARE WISE THEY KNOW THAT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FEET AND EARS AND BODIES ARE JUST THE WAY THAT THEY WERE FIRST MADE TO BE
8470-286666-0016 NOW THE BIGGEST FROG SWALLOWED A GREAT DEAL OF AIR FILLED THE SACS ON EACH SIDE OF HIS NECK WITH IT OPENED HIS BIG MOUTH AND SANG CROAKILY
8470-286666-0017 AND ALL THE OTHERS SANG FROGS FROGS FROGS AS LONG AS HE THE GULLS HEARD IT AND THE MUSKRATS HEARD IT AND ALL WERE HAPPY BECAUSE SPRING HAD COME
8470-286666-0018 A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GREEN BROWN FROG WHO HAD NEVER FELT GROWN UP UNTIL NOW TRIED TO SING WITH THE OTHERS BUT SHE HAD NOT A STRONG VOICE AND WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO STOP AND VISIT WITH THE BIGGEST FROG'S SISTER
8470-286666-0019 DON'T YOU WISH WE COULD SING AS LOUDLY AS THEY CAN SAID SHE NO ANSWERED THE BIGGEST FROG'S SISTER
8470-286666-0020 WORK FIRST YOU KNOW AND PLEASURE AFTERWARD OH SAID THE GREEN BROWN FROG
8470-286666-0021 YOU MAY BE VERY SURE I DON'T WANT TO SING THEN ANSWERED THE OLDER FROG I AM TOO TIRED BESIDES AFTER THE EGGS ARE LAID THERE IS NO REASON FOR WANTING TO SING
8470-286666-0022 WHY NOT ASKED THE GREEN BROWN FROG I DON'T SEE WHAT DIFFERENCE THAT MAKES THAT SAID THE OLDER FROG WISELY
8470-286666-0023 THE GREAT TIME FOR SINGING IS BEFORE THE EGGS ARE LAID THERE IS SOME SINGING AFTERWARD BUT THAT IS ONLY BECAUSE PEOPLE EXPECT IT OF US AND NOT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SAME WISH TO SING
8470-286666-0024 AFTER SHE HAD SAID ALL THIS WHICH WAS A GREAT DEAL FOR A FROG TO SAY AT ONCE SHE SHUT HER BIG MOUTH AND SLID HER EYELIDS OVER HER EYES
8470-286666-0025 WHEN SHE OPENED THEM AGAIN THE BIGGEST FROG'S SISTER HAD HOPPED AWAY AND IN HER PLACE SAT THE YELLOW BROWN FROG THE SAME HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD FOUND ONE OF HIS TOES IN THE WAY
8470-286666-0026 IT QUITE STARTLED HER TO FIND HIM SITTING SO CLOSE TO HER
8470-286666-0027 THE YELLOW BROWN FROG HOPPED A LITTLE NEARER AND SANG AS LOUDLY AS HE COULD
8470-286666-0028 AND SHE WAS EXCEEDINGLY HAPPY SHE SWALLOWED AIR VERY FAST BECAUSE SHE SEEMED TO BE OUT OF BREATH FROM THINKING WHAT SHE SHOULD ANSWER SHE HAD WANTED TO ASK THE BIGGEST FROG'S SISTER WHAT SHE SHOULD SAY IF ANY ONE SANG TO HER ALONE
8470-286666-0029 ALL SHE HAD TO DO WAS TO GIVE A GREAT JUMP AND SPLASH INTO THE WATER SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO AWAY YET SHE MADE BELIEVE THAT SHE DID FOR SHE HOPPED A LITTLE FARTHER FROM HIM
8470-286666-0030 HE KNEW SHE WAS ONLY PRETENDING THOUGH FOR SHE HADN'T HOPPED MORE THAN THE LENGTH OF A GRASS BLADE
8470-286666-0031 THEY STAYED TOGETHER FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND HE SANG A GREAT DEAL AND VERY LOUDLY
8470-286666-0032 AFTER A WHILE SHE REMEMBERED THAT SHE WAS NOW A FULLY GROWN FROG AND HAD SPRING WORK TO DO AND SHE SAID TO HIM
8470-286666-0033 WHICH MADE THEM STICK TO EACH OTHER AS THEY FLOATED IN LITTLE HEAPS ON THE WATER THE FROGS THOUGHT THAT A GOOD THING FOR THEN WHEN THE TADPOLES HATCHED EACH WOULD HAVE PLAYMATES NEAR ONE DAY
8470-286666-0034 AFTER THE EGGS WERE ALL LAID AND WERE GROWING FINELY FOR FROGS EGGS GROW UNTIL THE TADPOLES ARE READY TO EAT THEIR WAY OUT THE GREEN BROWN FROG SAT ALONE ON THE BANK OF THE POND AND THE BIGGEST FROG'S SISTER CAME TO HER
8470-286666-0035 SHE HAD A QUEER SMILE AROUND THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH FROGS HAVE EXCELLENT MOUTHS FOR SMILING BUT IT TAKES A VERY BROAD SMILE TO GO WAY ACROSS SO WHEN THEY SMILE A LITTLE
8470-286666-0036 OH ANSWERED THE GREEN BROWN FROG SADLY
8470-286666-0037 IS THERE ANY REASON WHY YOU SHOULD KNOW WHICH ONES THEY ARE IT ISN'T AS THOUGH YOU WERE A BIRD AND HAD TO KEEP THEM WARM OR AS THOUGH YOU WERE A MINK AND HAD TO FEED YOUR CHILDREN THE SUN WILL HATCH THEM
8470-286666-0038 I THINK SAID THE GREEN BROWN FROG THAT MY EGGS WERE A LITTLE BETTER THAN THE REST YES CROAKED THE BIGGEST FROG'S SISTER EVERY FROG THINKS THAT
8470-286666-0039 AND I WANTED TO HAVE MY OWN TADPOLES TO LOOK AFTER SIGHED THE GREEN BROWN FROG WHY ASKED THE BIGGEST FROG'S SISTER
8470-286666-0040 CAN'T YOU TAKE ANY COMFORT WITH A TADPOLE UNLESS YOU LAID THE EGG FROM WHICH HE WAS HATCHED I NEVER KNOW ONE OF MY OWN EGGS A DAY AFTER IT IS LAID THERE ARE SUCH A LOT FLOATING AROUND THAT THEY ARE SURE TO GET MIXED
8470-286666-0041 BUT I JUST MAKE THE BEST OF IT HOW ASKED THE GREEN BROWN FROG LOOKING A LITTLE MORE CHEERFUL
8470-286666-0042 POOR SORT OF FROG IT WOULD BE WHO COULDN'T LIKE OTHER PEOPLE'S TADPOLES
8470-286666-0043 AND THEN SHE ADDED WHAT A COMFORT IT WILL BE IF ANY OF THEM ARE CROSS OR RUDE TO THINK
8470-286666-0044 AND THEN ADOPT THE BEST ONES DO YOU KNOW I HAVE ALMOST DECIDED THAT YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER
