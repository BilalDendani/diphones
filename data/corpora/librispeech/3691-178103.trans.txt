3691-178103-0000 NEVER A TAWNY BEACHED OCEAN HAS THE SWEETNESS OF THE PRAIRIE SLEW RIPPLING AND BLUE WITH LONG GRASS UP TO ITS EDGE A SPOT OF DANCING LIGHT SET IN THE MILES OF RUSTLING WHEAT IT RETAINS EVEN IN JULY
3691-178103-0001 ON AN AFTERNOON OF GLARE AND BRAZEN LOCUSTS THE FRESHNESS OF A SPRING MORNING A THOUSAND SLEWS A HUNDRED LAKES BORDERED WITH RIPPLING BARLEY OR TINKLING BELLS OF THE FLAX CLAIRE PASSED
3691-178103-0002 SHE HAD LEFT THE OCCASIONAL GROVES OF OAK AND POPLAR AND SILVER BIRCH AND COME OUT ON THE TREELESS GREAT PLAINS SHE HAD LEARNED TO CALL THE SLEWS
3691-178103-0003 AND TO WATCH FOR DUCKS AT TWILIGHT SHE HAD LEARNED THAT ABOUT THE PUGHOLES FLUTTER CHOIRS OF CRIMSON WINGED BLACKBIRDS THAT THE UGLY BROWN BIRDS SQUATTING ON FENCE RAILS WERE THE DIVINE VOICED MEADOW LARKS
3691-178103-0004 THAT AMONG THE HUMBLE COWBIRD CITIZENS OF THE PASTURES SOMETIMES FLAUNTED A SCARLET TANAGER OR AN ORIOLE AND THAT NO ROSE GARDEN HAS THE QUAINT AND HARDY BEAUTY OF THE INDIAN PAINT BRUSHES
3691-178103-0005 SHE HAD LEARNED THAT WHAT HAD SEEMED RUDENESS IN GARAGE MEN AND HOTEL CLERKS WAS OFTEN A RESENTFUL REFLECTION OF HER OWN EASTERN ATTITUDE THAT SHE WAS NECESSARILY SUPERIOR TO A RACE SHE HAD BEEN TRAINED TO CALL
3691-178103-0006 COMMON PEOPLE IF SHE SPOKE UP FRANKLY THEY MADE HER ONE OF THEIR OWN AND GAVE HER COMPANIONABLE AID FOR TWO DAYS OF SUNSHINE AND DRYING MUD
3691-178103-0007 SHE FOLLOWED A ROAD FLUNG STRAIGHT ACROSS FLAT WHEATLANDS THEN CURVING AMONG LOW HILLS OFTEN THERE WERE NO FENCES SHE WAS SO INTIMATELY IN AMONG THE GRAIN THAT THE FENDERS OF THE CAR BRUSHED WHEAT STALKS
3691-178103-0008 AND SHE BECAME NO STRANGER BUT A PART OF ALL THIS VAST HORIZONED LAND SHE FORGOT THAT SHE WAS DRIVING AS SHE LET THE CAR CREEP ON WHILE SHE WAS TRANSPORTED BY ARMADAS OF CLOUDS
3691-178103-0009 PRAIRIE CLOUDS WISPS OF VAPOR LIKE A RIBBED BEACH OR MOUNTS OF CUMULUS SWELLING TO GOLD WASHED SNOWY PEAKS THE FRIENDLINESS OF THE BEARING EARTH GAVE HER A CALM THAT TOOK NO HEED OF PASSING HOURS
3691-178103-0010 EVEN HER FATHER THE ABSTRACTED MAN OF AFFAIRS NODDED TO DUSTY PEOPLE ALONG THE ROAD TO A JOLLY OLD MAN WHOSE BULK ROLLED AND SHOOK IN A TINY RHYTHMICALLY CREAKING BUGGY
3691-178103-0011 TO WOMEN IN THE SMALL ABRUPT TOWNS WITH THEIR HUGE RED ELEVATORS AND THEIR LONG FLAT ROOFED STORES CLAIRE HAD DISCOVERED AMERICA AND SHE FELT STRONGER AND ALL HER DAYS WERE COLORED WITH THE SUN
3691-178103-0012 SHE HAD DISCOVERED TOO THAT SHE COULD ADVENTURE NO LONGER WAS SHE HAUNTED BY THE APPREHENSION THAT HAD WHISPERED TO HER AS SHE HAD LEFT MINNEAPOLIS SHE KNEW A THRILL WHEN SHE HAILED AS THOUGH IT WERE A PASSING SHIP
3691-178103-0013 AN ILLINOIS CAR ACROSS WHOSE DUST CAKED BACK WAS A BANNER CHICAGO TO THE YELLOWSTONE SHE EXPERIENCED A NEW SENSATION OF COMMON HUMANNESS WHEN ON A RAILWAY PARALLELING THE WAGON ROAD FOR MILES
3691-178103-0014 THE ENGINEER OF A FREIGHT WAVED HIS HAND TO HER AND TOOTED THE WHISTLE IN GREETING HER FATHER WAS EASILY TIRED BUT HE DROWSED THROUGH THE EARLY AFTERNOONS WHEN A NONE TOO DIGESTIBLE SMALL TOWN LUNCH WAS AS LEAD WITHIN HIM
3691-178103-0015 DESPITE THE BEAUTY OF THE LAND AND THE JOY OF PUSHING ON THEY BOTH HAD THINGS TO ENDURE AFTER LUNCH IT WAS SOMETIMES AN AGONY TO CLAIRE TO KEEP AWAKE HER EYES FELT GREASY FROM THE FOOD OR SMARTED WITH THE SUN GLARE
3691-178103-0016 THE HEAT FROM THE ENGINE WAS A TORMENT ABOUT HER FEET AND IF THERE WAS ANOTHER CAR AHEAD THE TRAIL OF DUST SIFTED INTO HER THROAT UNLESS THERE WAS TRAFFIC TO KEEP HER AWAKE SHE NODDED AT THE WHEEL
3691-178103-0017 SHE WAS MERELY A PART OF A MACHINE THAT RAN ON WITHOUT SEEMING TO MAKE ANY IMPRESSION ON THE PRAIRIE'S ENDLESSNESS
3691-178103-0018 SLOW FOR DOWN HILL CAREFUL OF SAND AT THE BOTTOM
3691-178103-0019 WAVING TO A LONELY FARMWIFE IN HER SMALL BAKED DOORYARD SLOW TO PASS A HAY WAGON
3691-178103-0020 AND REPEAT THE ROUND ALL OVER AGAIN BUT SHE WAS JOYOUS TILL NOON AND WITH MID AFTERNOON A NEW STRENGTH CAME WHICH AS ROSE CREPT ABOVE THE GOLDEN HAZE OF DUST DEEPENED INTO SERENE MEDITATION
3691-178103-0021 AND SHE WAS FINDING THE ONE SECRET OF LONG DISTANCE DRIVING NAMELY DRIVING KEEPING ON THINKING BY FIFTY MILE UNITS NOT BY THE TEN MILE STRETCHES OF LONG ISLAND RUNS AND NOT FRETTING OVER ANYTHING WHATEVER
3691-178103-0022 SHE SEEMED CHARMED IF SHE HAD A PUNCTURE WHY SHE PUT ON THE SPARE IF SHE RAN OUT OF GAS WHY ANY PASSING DRIVER WOULD LEND HER A GALLON
3691-178103-0023 NOTHING IT SEEMED COULD HALT HER LEVEL FLIGHT ACROSS THE GIANT LAND SHE RARELY LOST HER WAY SHE WAS GUIDED BY THE FRIENDLY TRAIL SIGNS
3691-178103-0024 MAGICALLY TELLING THE WAY FROM THE MISSISSIPPI TO THE PACIFIC HER FATHER'S OCCASIONAL MUSING TALK KEPT HER FROM LONELINESS HE WAS A GOOD TOURING COMPANION MOTORING IS NOT THE BEST OCCASION FOR EPIGRAMS SATIRE
3691-178103-0025 AND THE GOOD ONE YOU GOT OFF AT THE LAMBS CLUB LAST NIGHT SUCH VERBIAGE ON MOTOR TRIPS INVARIABLY RESULTS IN THE MYSTERIOUS FINDING OF THE CORPSE OF A STRANGE MAN WELL DRESSED HIDDEN BESIDE THE ROAD
3691-178103-0026 CLAIRE AND HER FATHER MUMBLED GOOD FARMHOUSE BRICK OR NICE VIEW AND SMILED AND WERE FOR MILES AS SILENT AS THE COMPANIONABLE SKY SHE THOUGHT OF THE PEOPLE SHE KNEW
3691-178103-0027 ESPECIALLY OF JEFF SAXTON BUT SHE COULD NOT CLEARLY REMEMBER HIS LEAN EARNEST FACE BETWEEN HER AND JEFF WERE SWEEPING SUNNY LEAGUES BUT SHE WAS NOT LONELY
3691-178103-0028 NO SINGER AFTER A FIRST CONCERT HAS FELT MORE TRIUMPHANT THAN CLAIRE WHEN SHE CROSSED HER FIRST STATE LINE RUMBLED OVER THE BRIDGE ACROSS THE RED RIVER INTO NORTH DAKOTA
3691-178103-0029 WAS LIKE THE SENSATION OF STREET SIGNS IN A NEW LANGUAGE AND WHEN SHE FOUND A GOOD HOTEL IN FARGO AND HAD A REAL BATH SHE FELT THAT BY HER OWN EFFORTS SHE HAD EARNED THE RIGHT TO ENJOY IT
3691-178103-0030 MISTER BOLTWOOD CAUGHT HER ENTHUSIASM DINNER WAS A FESTIVAL AND IN ICED TEA THE PEACEFUL CONQUISTADORES DRANK THE TOAST OF THE NEW SPANISH MAIN AND AFTERWARD ARM IN ARM WENT CHATTERING TO THE MOVIES

3691-178103-0034 LADY VERE DE VERE AFRAID OF FARGO AND MOVIE CROWDS BUT TRUSTING IN HER ITINERANT CASTLE THE BUG WAS CURLED IN MILT DAGGETT'S ULSTER IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR SHE TWINKLED HER WHISKERS AT CLAIRE
3691-178103-0035 AND PURRED TO A STROKING HAND WITH THE EXCITEMENT OF ONE TRYING TO FIND THE ADDRESS OF A FRIEND IN A STRANGE LAND CLAIRE LOOKED OVER THE AUDIENCE WHEN THE LIGHTS CAME ON BEFORE THE VAUDEVILLE
3691-178103-0036 IN THE SECOND ROW SHE SAW MILT'S STIFFISH ROPE COLORED HAIR SURPRISINGLY SMOOTH ABOVE AN ASTOUNDINGLY CLEAN NEW TAN SHIRT OF MERCERIZED SILK
3691-178103-0037 HE LAUGHED FURIOUSLY AT THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN PETE ROSENHEIM AND LAROSE BETTINA THOUGH IT CONTAINED THE CHEESE JOKE THE MOTHER IN LAW JOKE AND THE JOKE ABOUT THE WIFE RIFLING HER HUSBAND'S POCKETS
3691-178103-0038 OUR YOUNG FRIEND SEEMS TO HAVE ENVIABLE YOUTHFUL SPIRITS COMMENTED MISTER BOLTWOOD NOW NO SUPERIORITY HE'S PROBABLY NEVER SEEN A REAL VAUDEVILLE SHOW
3691-178103-0039 OR THE FOLLIES FOR THE FIRST TIME INSTEAD OF BEING TAKEN BY JEFF SAXTON AND HAVING THE HUMOR OH SO ARTICULATELY EXPLAINED THE PICTURES WERE RESUMED THE FILM WHICH
