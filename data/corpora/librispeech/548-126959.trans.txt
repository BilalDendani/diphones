548-126959-0000 THE NEXT SUMMER THE TRUCE FOR A YEAR ENDED AFTER LASTING UNTIL THE PYTHIAN GAMES DURING THE ARMISTICE THE ATHENIANS EXPELLED THE DELIANS FROM DELOS
548-126959-0001 CONCLUDING THAT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN POLLUTED BY SOME OLD OFFENCE AT THE TIME OF THEIR CONSECRATION AND THAT THIS HAD BEEN THE OMISSION IN THE PREVIOUS PURIFICATION OF THE ISLAND WHICH AS I HAVE RELATED
548-126959-0002 HAD BEEN THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DULY ACCOMPLISHED BY THE REMOVAL OF THE GRAVES OF THE DEAD THE DELIANS HAD ATRAMYTTIUM IN ASIA GIVEN THEM BY PHARNACES AND SETTLED THERE AS THEY REMOVED FROM DELOS MEANWHILE
548-126959-0003 WITH TWELVE HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY AND THREE HUNDRED HORSE FROM ATHENS
548-126959-0004 FIRST TOUCHING AT THE STILL BESIEGED SCIONE AND TAKING SOME HEAVY INFANTRY FROM THE ARMY THERE HE NEXT SAILED INTO COPHOS A HARBOUR IN THE TERRITORY OF TORONE WHICH IS NOT FAR FROM THE TOWN FROM THENCE
548-126959-0005 AND THAT ITS GARRISON WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO GIVE HIM BATTLE HE ADVANCED WITH HIS ARMY AGAINST THE TOWN SENDING TEN SHIPS TO SAIL ROUND INTO THE HARBOUR
548-126959-0006 IN ORDER TO TAKE IN THE SUBURB TO DO WHICH HE HAD PULLED DOWN PART OF THE ORIGINAL WALL AND MADE IT ALL ONE CITY TO THIS POINT PASITELIDAS THE LACEDAEMONIAN COMMANDER
548-126959-0007 PASITELIDAS BEGAN TO BE AFRAID THAT THEY MIGHT GET UP TO THE CITY BEFORE ITS DEFENDERS WERE THERE AND THE FORTIFICATION BEING ALSO CARRIED HE MIGHT BE TAKEN PRISONER AND SO ABANDONED THE OUTWORK AND RAN INTO THE TOWN
548-126959-0008 BUT THE ATHENIANS FROM THE SHIPS HAD ALREADY TAKEN TORONE
548-126959-0009 KILLING SOME OF THE PELOPONNESIANS AND TORONAEANS IN THE MELEE AND MAKING PRISONERS OF THE REST AND PASITELIDAS THEIR COMMANDER AMONGST THEM
548-126959-0010 AND HAD ONLY ABOUT FOUR MILES MORE TO GO WHEN HE HEARD OF ITS FALL ON THE ROAD AND TURNED BACK AGAIN
548-126959-0011 ONE BY THE HARBOUR THE OTHER BY THE FORTIFICATION AND MAKING SLAVES OF THE WIVES AND CHILDREN OF THE TORONAEANS SENT THE MEN WITH THE PELOPONNESIANS AND ANY CHALCIDIANS THAT WERE THERE TO THE NUMBER OF SEVEN HUNDRED TO ATHENS
548-126959-0012 WHENCE HOWEVER THEY ALL CAME HOME AFTERWARDS THE PELOPONNESIANS ON THE CONCLUSION OF PEACE AND THE REST BY BEING EXCHANGED AGAINST OTHER PRISONERS WITH THE OLYNTHIANS ABOUT THE SAME TIME PANACTUM
548-126959-0013 A FORTRESS ON THE ATHENIAN BORDER
548-126959-0014 SET SAIL WITH TWO COLLEAGUES AS AMBASSADOR FROM ATHENS TO ITALY AND SICILY
548-126959-0015 A QUARTER OF THE TOWN OF LEONTINI AND BRICINNIAE A STRONG PLACE IN THE LEONTINE COUNTRY AND BEING THERE JOINED BY MOST OF THE EXILED COMMONS CARRIED ON WAR FROM THE FORTIFICATIONS
548-126959-0016 THE ATHENIANS HEARING THIS SENT PHAEAX TO SEE IF THEY COULD NOT BY SOME MEANS SO CONVINCE THEIR ALLIES THERE AND THE REST OF THE SICILIANS OF THE AMBITIOUS DESIGNS OF SYRACUSE
548-126959-0017 AND ALSO FELL IN WITH SOME LOCRIAN SETTLERS EXILED FROM MESSINA WHO HAD BEEN SENT THITHER WHEN THE LOCRIANS WERE CALLED IN BY ONE OF THE FACTIONS THAT DIVIDED MESSINA AFTER THE PACIFICATION OF SICILY
548-126959-0018 THEY WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE OF THE ALLIES WHO WHEN THE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE SICILIANS TOOK PLACE HAD NOT MADE PEACE WITH HER
548-126959-0019 NOR INDEED WOULD THEY HAVE DONE SO NOW IF THEY HAD NOT BEEN PRESSED BY A WAR WITH THE HIPPONIANS AND MEDMAEANS WHO LIVED ON THEIR BORDER AND WERE COLONISTS OF THEIRS PHAEAX MEANWHILE
548-126959-0020 PROCEEDED ON HIS VOYAGE AND AT LENGTH ARRIVED AT ATHENS CLEON
548-126959-0021 HE NOW SENT ENVOYS TO PERDICCAS TO COMMAND HIS ATTENDANCE WITH AN ARMY AS PROVIDED BY THE ALLIANCE AND OTHERS TO THRACE
548-126959-0022 WHO WAS TO BRING AS MANY THRACIAN MERCENARIES AS POSSIBLE
548-126959-0023 AWAITING THEIR ARRIVAL INFORMED OF THIS
548-126959-0024 DESPISING THE SCANTY NUMBERS OF HIS OPPONENT WOULD MARCH AGAINST AMPHIPOLIS WITH THE FORCE THAT HE HAD GOT WITH HIM
548-126959-0025 CALLING TO HIS STANDARD FIFTEEN HUNDRED THRACIAN MERCENARIES AND ALL THE EDONIANS HORSE AND TARGETEERS HE ALSO HAD A THOUSAND MYRCINIAN AND CHALCIDIAN TARGETEERS BESIDES THOSE IN AMPHIPOLIS
548-126959-0026 AND A FORCE OF HEAVY INFANTRY NUMBERING ALTOGETHER ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND THREE HUNDRED HELLENIC HORSE
548-126959-0027 AFTER REMAINING QUIET FOR SOME TIME
548-126959-0028 HIS SOLDIERS TIRED OF THEIR INACTIVITY BEGAN ALSO SERIOUSLY TO REFLECT ON THE WEAKNESS AND INCOMPETENCE OF THEIR COMMANDER AND THE SKILL AND VALOUR THAT WOULD BE OPPOSED TO HIM AND ON THEIR OWN ORIGINAL UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCOMPANY HIM
548-126959-0029 AND BROKE UP HIS CAMP AND ADVANCED THE TEMPER OF THE GENERAL WAS WHAT IT HAD BEEN AT PYLOS HIS SUCCESS ON THAT OCCASION HAVING GIVEN HIM CONFIDENCE IN HIS CAPACITY
548-126959-0030 HE NEVER DREAMED OF ANY ONE COMING OUT TO FIGHT HIM BUT SAID THAT HE WAS RATHER GOING UP TO VIEW THE PLACE AND IF HE WAITED FOR HIS REINFORCEMENTS IT WAS NOT IN ORDER TO MAKE VICTORY SECURE IN CASE HE SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO ENGAGE
548-126959-0031 AND HOW THE TOWN LAY ON THE SIDE OF THRACE HE THOUGHT TO RETIRE AT PLEASURE WITHOUT FIGHTING AS THERE WAS NO ONE TO BE SEEN UPON THE WALL OR COMING OUT OF THE GATES ALL OF WHICH WERE SHUT INDEED
548-126959-0032 HE DID NOT VENTURE TO GO OUT IN REGULAR ORDER AGAINST THE ATHENIANS HE MISTRUSTED HIS STRENGTH AND THOUGHT IT INADEQUATE TO THE ATTEMPT NOT IN NUMBERS THESE WERE NOT SO UNEQUAL BUT IN QUALITY
548-126959-0033 THE FLOWER OF THE ATHENIAN ARMY BEING IN THE FIELD WITH THE BEST OF THE LEMNIANS AND IMBRIANS HE THEREFORE PREPARED TO ASSAIL THEM BY STRATAGEM BY SHOWING THE ENEMY THE NUMBER OF HIS TROOPS AND THE SHIFTS
548-126959-0034 WHICH HE HAD BEEN PUT TO TO TO ARM THEM HE THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE LESS CHANCE OF BEATING HIM THAN BY NOT LETTING HIM HAVE A SIGHT OF THEM AND THUS LEARN HOW GOOD A RIGHT HE HAD TO DESPISE THEM
548-126959-0035 THINKING THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE AGAIN SUCH A CHANCE OF CATCHING THEM ALONE IF THEIR REINFORCEMENTS WERE ONCE ALLOWED TO COME UP AND SO CALLING ALL HIS SOLDIERS TOGETHER IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE THEM AND EXPLAIN HIS INTENTION SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
548-126959-0036 PELOPONNESIANS THE CHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH WE HAVE COME ONE WHICH HAS ALWAYS OWED ITS FREEDOM TO VALOUR AND THE FACT THAT YOU ARE DORIANS AND THE ENEMY YOU ARE ABOUT TO FIGHT IONIANS WHOM YOU ARE ACCUSTOMED TO BEAT
548-126959-0037 ARE THINGS THAT DO NOT NEED FURTHER COMMENT BUT THE PLAN OF ATTACK THAT I PROPOSE TO PURSUE THIS IT IS AS WELL TO EXPLAIN IN ORDER THAT THE FACT OF OUR ADVENTURING WITH A PART INSTEAD OF WITH THE WHOLE OF OUR FORCES
548-126959-0038 MAY NOT DAMP YOUR COURAGE BY THE APPARENT DISADVANTAGE AT WHICH IT PLACES YOU I IMAGINE IT IS THE POOR OPINION THAT HE HAS OF US AND THE FACT THAT HE HAS NO IDEA OF ANY ONE COMING OUT TO ENGAGE HIM
548-126959-0039 THAT HAS MADE THE ENEMY MARCH UP TO THE PLACE AND CARELESSLY LOOK ABOUT HIM AS HE IS DOING WITHOUT NOTICING US BUT THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SOLDIER WILL ALWAYS BE THE MAN WHO MOST HAPPILY DETECTS A BLUNDER LIKE THIS
548-126959-0040 AND WHO CAREFULLY CONSULTING HIS OWN MEANS MAKES HIS ATTACK NOT SO MUCH BY OPEN AND REGULAR APPROACHES AS BY SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE MOMENT
548-126959-0041 HAVE THE MOST BRILLIANT NAME IN WAR THEREFORE WHILE THEIR CARELESS CONFIDENCE CONTINUES AND THEY ARE STILL THINKING AS IN MY JUDGMENT THEY ARE NOW DOING MORE OF RETREAT THAN OF MAINTAINING THEIR POSITION
548-126959-0042 WHILE THEIR SPIRIT IS SLACK AND NOT HIGH STRUNG WITH EXPECTATION I WITH THE MEN UNDER MY COMMAND WILL IF POSSIBLE TAKE THEM BY SURPRISE AND FALL WITH A RUN UPON THEIR CENTRE
548-126959-0043 AS IS LIKELY DEALING TERROR AMONG THEM TAKE WITH YOU THE AMPHIPOLITANS AND THE REST OF THE ALLIES AND SUDDENLY OPEN THE GATES AND DASH AT THEM AND HASTEN TO ENGAGE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN THAT
548-126959-0044 IS OUR BEST CHANCE OF ESTABLISHING A PANIC AMONG THEM AS A FRESH ASSAILANT HAS ALWAYS MORE TERRORS FOR AN ENEMY THAN THE ONE HE IS IMMEDIATELY ENGAGED WITH SHOW YOURSELF A BRAVE MAN AS A SPARTAN SHOULD
548-126959-0045 AND DO YOU ALLIES FOLLOW HIM LIKE MEN AND REMEMBER THAT ZEAL HONOUR AND OBEDIENCE MARK THE GOOD SOLDIER
548-126959-0046 OR SLAVES OF ATHENS EVEN IF YOU ESCAPE WITHOUT PERSONAL LOSS OF LIBERTY OR LIFE YOUR BONDAGE WILL BE ON HARSHER TERMS THAN BEFORE AND YOU WILL ALSO HINDER THE LIBERATION OF THE REST OF THE HELLENES
548-126959-0047 NO COWARDICE THEN ON YOUR PART SEEING THE GREATNESS OF THE ISSUES AT STAKE AND I WILL SHOW THAT WHAT I PREACH TO OTHERS I CAN PRACTISE MYSELF
548-126959-0048 MEANWHILE HE HAD BEEN SEEN COMING DOWN FROM CERDYLIUM AND THEN IN THE CITY WHICH IS OVERLOOKED FROM THE OUTSIDE SACRIFICING NEAR THE TEMPLE OF ATHENE IN SHORT ALL HIS MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN OBSERVED
548-126959-0049 AND WORD WAS BROUGHT TO CLEON WHO HAD AT THE MOMENT GONE ON TO LOOK ABOUT HIM THAT THE WHOLE OF THE ENEMY'S FORCE COULD BE SEEN IN THE TOWN AND THAT THE FEET OF HORSES AND MEN IN GREAT NUMBERS WERE VISIBLE UNDER THE GATES
548-126959-0050 AS IF A SALLY WERE INTENDED UPON HEARING THIS HE WENT UP TO LOOK AND HAVING DONE SO BEING UNWILLING TO VENTURE UPON THE DECISIVE STEP OF A BATTLE BEFORE HIS REINFORCEMENTS CAME UP
548-126959-0051 AND FANCYING THAT HE WOULD HAVE TIME TO RETIRE
548-126959-0052 WHICH WAS INDEED THE ONLY WAY PRACTICABLE THIS HOWEVER NOT BEING QUICK ENOUGH FOR HIM HE JOINED THE RETREAT IN PERSON AND MADE THE RIGHT WING WHEEL ROUND THUS TURNING ITS UNARMED SIDE TO THE ENEMY
548-126959-0053 QUICK SOMEONE AND OPEN THE GATES I SPOKE OF AND LET US BE OUT AND AT THEM WITH NO FEARS FOR THE RESULT ACCORDINGLY ISSUING OUT BY THE PALISADE GATE AND BY THE FIRST IN THE LONG WALL THEN EXISTING
548-126959-0054 HE RAN AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED ALONG THE STRAIGHT ROAD WHERE THE TROPHY NOW STANDS AS YOU GO BY THE STEEPEST PART OF THE HILL AND FELL UPON AND ROUTED THE CENTRE OF THE ATHENIANS PANIC STRICKEN BY THEIR OWN DISORDER AND ASTOUNDED AT HIS AUDACITY
548-126959-0055 AND ALSO ATTACKED THE ENEMY THE RESULT WAS THAT THE ATHENIANS SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY ATTACKED ON BOTH SIDES FELL INTO CONFUSION
548-126959-0056 HE RECEIVED A WOUND BUT HIS FALL WAS NOT PERCEIVED BY THE ATHENIANS
548-126959-0057 THE ATHENIAN RIGHT MADE A BETTER STAND
548-126959-0058 WHO FROM THE FIRST HAD NO THOUGHT OF FIGHTING AT ONCE FLED AND WAS OVERTAKEN AND SLAIN BY A MYRCINIAN TARGETEER
548-126959-0059 THUS THE ATHENIAN ARMY WAS ALL NOW IN FLIGHT AND SUCH AS ESCAPED BEING KILLED IN THE BATTLE OR BY THE CHALCIDIAN HORSE AND THE TARGETEERS DISPERSED AMONG THE HILLS AND WITH DIFFICULTY
548-126959-0060 STRIPPED THE DEAD AND SET UP A TROPHY
548-126959-0061 IN FRONT OF WHAT IS NOW THE MARKETPLACE AND THE AMPHIPOLITANS HAVING ENCLOSED HIS TOMB EVER AFTERWARDS SACRIFICE TO HIM AS A HERO AND HAVE GIVEN TO HIM THE HONOUR OF GAMES AND ANNUAL OFFERINGS
548-126959-0062 THEY CONSTITUTED HIM THE FOUNDER OF THEIR COLONY AND PULLED DOWN THE HAGNONIC ERECTIONS AND OBLITERATED EVERYTHING THAT COULD BE INTERPRETED AS A MEMORIAL OF HIS HAVING FOUNDED THE PLACE
548-126959-0063 ABOUT SIX HUNDRED OF THE LATTER HAD FALLEN AND ONLY SEVEN OF THE ENEMY OWING TO THERE HAVING BEEN NO REGULAR ENGAGEMENT BUT THE AFFAIR OF ACCIDENT AND PANIC THAT I HAVE DESCRIBED AFTER TAKING UP THEIR DEAD THE ATHENIANS SAILED OFF HOME
548-126959-0064 REMAINED TO ARRANGE MATTERS AT AMPHIPOLIS
548-126959-0065 WHOM THEY CAME TO REINFORCE WAS DEAD THEY TURNED BACK HOME THINKING THAT THE MOMENT HAD GONE BY THE ATHENIANS BEING DEFEATED AND GONE AND THEMSELVES NOT EQUAL TO THE EXECUTION OF BRASIDAS'S DESIGNS
548-126959-0066 INDEED IT SO HAPPENED THAT DIRECTLY AFTER THE BATTLE OF AMPHIPOLIS AND THE RETREAT OF RAMPHIAS FROM THESSALY BOTH SIDES CEASED TO PROSECUTE THE WAR AND TURNED THEIR ATTENTION TO PEACE
548-126959-0067 IN THE BELIEF OF ULTIMATE VICTORY WHICH HER SUCCESS AT THE MOMENT HAD INSPIRED BESIDES SHE WAS AFRAID OF HER ALLIES BEING TEMPTED BY HER REVERSES TO REBEL MORE GENERALLY
548-126959-0068 FOUND THE EVENT OF THE WAR TO FALSIFY HER NOTION THAT A FEW YEARS WOULD SUFFICE FOR THE OVERTHROW OF THE POWER OF THE ATHENIANS BY THE DEVASTATION OF THEIR LAND SHE HAD SUFFERED ON THE ISLAND A DISASTER HITHERTO UNKNOWN AT SPARTA
548-126959-0069 SHE SAW HER COUNTRY PLUNDERED FROM PYLOS AND CYTHERA THE HELOTS WERE DESERTING AND SHE WAS IN CONSTANT APPREHENSION THAT THOSE WHO REMAINED IN PELOPONNESE WOULD RELY UPON THOSE OUTSIDE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION
548-126959-0070 TO RENEW THEIR OLD ATTEMPTS AT REVOLUTION BESIDES THIS AS CHANCE WOULD HAVE IT
548-126959-0071 AND THEY REFUSED TO RENEW IT
548-126959-0072 SO THAT IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGHT ARGOS AND ATHENS AT ONCE SHE ALSO SUSPECTED SOME OF THE CITIES IN PELOPONNESE OF INTENDING TO GO OVER TO THE ENEMY AND THAT WAS INDEED THE CASE
548-126959-0073 THESE CONSIDERATIONS MADE BOTH SIDES DISPOSED FOR AN ACCOMMODATION THE LACEDAEMONIANS BEING PROBABLY THE MOST EAGER AS THEY ARDENTLY DESIRED TO RECOVER THE MEN TAKEN UPON THE ISLAND
