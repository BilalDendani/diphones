2039-141208-0000 AND MUREMBWE IS A CLUSTER OF VILLAGES CALLED BIKARI
2039-141208-0001 AS WE WERE RENDERED UNABLE TO COPE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME WITH ANY MISCHIEVOUSLY INCLINED COMMUNITY
2039-141208-0002 AND LED US MORE THAN ONCE INTO DANGEROUS PLACES THE GUIDES EVIDENTLY HAD NO OBJECTIONS TO HALT AT BIKARI
2039-141208-0003 AS IT WAS THE SECOND CAMP FROM MUKUNGU BECAUSE WITH THEM A HALT IN THE COOL SHADE OF PLAINTAINS WAS INFINITELY PREFERABLE TO SITTING LIKE CARVED PIECES OF WOOD IN A CRANKY CANOE BUT BEFORE THEY STATED THEIR OBJECTIONS AND PREFERENCES
2039-141208-0004 FINDING THREATS OF NO AVAIL THEY HAD RECOURSE TO STONES AND ACCORDINGLY FLUNG THEM AT US IN A MOST HEARTY MANNER
2039-141208-0005 BUT LIVINGSTONE THOUGH HE SAID NOTHING YET SHOWED PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT HE DID NOT QUITE APPROVE OF THIS AS THESE DEMONSTRATIONS OF HOSTILITY WERE ANYTHING BUT WELCOME AND AS WE SAW SIGNS OF IT ALMOST EVERY TIME WE CAME OPPOSITE A VILLAGE
2039-141208-0006 WE KEPT ON OUR WAY UNTIL WE CAME TO MUREMBWE POINT WHICH BEING A DELTA OF A RIVER OF THE SAME NAME
2039-141208-0007 FROM WHICH THE BOLDEST MRUNDI MIGHT WELL SHRINK ESPECIALLY IF HE CALLED TO MIND THAT BEYOND THIS INHOSPITABLE SWAMP WERE THE GUNS OF THE STRANGERS HIS LIKE HAD SO RUDELY CHALLENGED WE DREW OUR CANOE ASHORE HERE AND ON A LIMITED AREA OF CLEAN SAND
2039-141208-0008 FERAJJI OUR ROUGH AND READY COOK LIT HIS FIRE AND MANUFACTURED FOR US A SUPPLY OF MOST DELICIOUS MOCHA COFFEE
2039-141208-0009 AND SEASONED OUR MEAL WITH A LITTLE MORAL PHILOSOPHY
2039-141208-0010 UPON WHOM WE NOW LOOKED DOWN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MOCHA COFFEE AND MORAL PHILOSOPHY WITH CALM CONTEMPT NOT UNMIXED WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF COMPASSION THE DOCTOR RELATED SOME EXPERIENCES HE HAD HAD AMONG PEOPLE OF SIMILAR DISPOSITION
2039-141208-0011 IN THIS OPINION I UNRESERVEDLY CONCUR FROM MUREMBWE POINT HAVING FINISHED OUR COFFEE AND ENDED OUR DISCOURSE ON ETHICS WE PROCEEDED ON OUR VOYAGE
2039-141208-0012 AS IT WAS A FINE MOONLIGHT NIGHT AND WE WERE FULLY ALIVE TO THE DANGEROUS POSITION IN WHICH WE MIGHT FIND OURSELVES THEY CONSENTED TO PULL AN HOUR OR TWO MORE ABOUT ONE P M WE PULLED IN SHORE FOR A DESERTED SPOT
2039-141208-0013 A CLEAN SHELF OF SAND ABOUT THIRTY FEET LONG BY TEN DEEP FROM WHICH A CLAY BANK ROSE ABOUT TEN OR TWELVE FEET ABOVE WHILE ON EACH SIDE THERE WERE MASSES OF DISINTEGRATED ROCK HERE WE THOUGHT THAT BY PRESERVING SOME DEGREE OF SILENCE WE MIGHT ESCAPE OBSERVATION
2039-141208-0014 AND CONSEQUENT ANNOYANCE FOR A FEW HOURS WHEN BEING RESTED WE MIGHT CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY OUR KETTLE WAS BOILING FOR TEA AND THE MEN HAD BUILT A LITTLE FIRE FOR THEMSELVES AND HAD FILLED THEIR BLACK EARTHEN POT WITH WATER FOR PORRIDGE
2039-141208-0015 BEING HAILED THEY AT ONCE CAME FORWARD AND SALUTED US WITH THE NATIVE WAKE OUR GUIDES EXPLAINED THAT WE WERE WANGWANA AND INTENDED TO CAMP UNTIL MORNING WHEN IF THEY HAD ANYTHING TO SELL WE SHOULD BE GLAD TO TRADE WITH THEM
2039-141208-0016 THESE ALSO WENT AWAY OVER EXUBERANT AS I THOUGHT AND WERE SHORTLY SUCCEEDED BY A THIRD PARTY WHO CAME AND WENT AS THE OTHERS HAD FROM ALL THIS WE INFERRED THAT THE NEWS WAS SPREADING RAPIDLY THROUGH THE VILLAGES ABOUT
2039-141208-0017 AT LEAST BETWEEN UJIJI AND ZANZIBAR TO BE ABOUT VISITING AND SALUTING AFTER DARK UNDER ANY PRETENCE IT IS NOT PERMITTED TO PERSONS TO PROWL ABOUT CAMP AFTER DARK WITHOUT BEING SHOT AT AND THIS GOING BACKWARD AND FORWARD
2039-141208-0018 THIS OSTENTATIOUS EXUBERANCE OF JOY AT THE ARRIVAL OF A SMALL PARTY OF WANGWANA WHICH IN MANY PARTS OF URUNDI WOULD BE REGARDED AS A VERY COMMON EVENT WAS ALTOGETHER VERY SUSPICIOUS
2039-141208-0019 WHILE THE DOCTOR AND I WERE ARRIVING AT THE CONCLUSION THAT THESE MOVEMENTS WERE PRELIMINARY TO OR SIGNIFICANT OF HOSTILITY A FOURTH BODY VERY BOISTEROUS AND LOUD CAME AND VISITED US OUR SUPPER HAD BEEN BY THIS TIME DESPATCHED AND WE THOUGHT IT HIGH TIME TO ACT
2039-141208-0020 THE FOURTH PARTY HAVING GONE WITH EXTRAVAGANT MANIFESTATIONS OF DELIGHT THE MEN WERE HURRIED INTO THE CANOE AND WHEN ALL WERE SEATED AND THE LOOK OUTS EMBARKED WE QUIETLY PUSHED OFF BUT NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON AS THE CANOE WAS GLIDING FROM THE DARKENED LIGHT THAT SURROUNDED US
2039-141208-0021 I CALLED THE DOCTOR'S ATTENTION TO SEVERAL DARK FORMS SOME OF WHOM WERE CROUCHING BEHIND THE ROCKS ON OUR RIGHT AND OTHERS SCRAMBLING OVER THEM TO OBTAIN GOOD OR BETTER POSITIONS AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE WERE APPROACHING FROM THE LEFT OF OUR POSITION IN THE SAME SUSPICIOUS WAY
2039-141208-0022 AND DIRECTLY A VOICE HAILED US FROM THE TOP OF THE CLAY BANK OVERHANGING THE SANDY SHELF WHERE WE HAD LATELY BEEN RESTING NEATLY DONE CRIED THE DOCTOR AS WE WERE SHOOTING THROUGH THE WATER LEAVING THE DISCOMFITED WOULD BE ROBBERS BEHIND US
2039-141208-0023 WE STOPPED AT THE SMALL FISHING VILLAGE OF MUGEYO WHERE WE WERE PERMITTED TO SLEEP UNMOLESTED
2039-141208-0024 WE HAD PULLED FOR EIGHTEEN HOURS AT A STRETCH WHICH AT THE RATE OF TWO MILES AND A HALF PER HOUR WOULD MAKE FORTY FIVE MILES TAKING BEARINGS FROM OUR CAMP AT CAPE MAGALA ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT POINTS IN TRAVELLING NORTH FROM UJIJI
2039-141208-0025 WE FOUND THAT THE LARGE ISLAND OF MUZIMU
2039-141208-0026 BORE ABOUT SOUTH SOUTH WEST AND THAT THE WESTERN SHORE HAD CONSIDERABLY APPROACHED TO THE EASTERN THE BREADTH OF THE LAKE BEING AT THIS POINT ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN MILES WE HAD A GOOD VIEW OF THE WESTERN HIGHLANDS WHICH SEEMED TO BE OF AN AVERAGE HEIGHT
2039-141208-0027 THE COUNTRY OPPOSITE TO THIS PART OF URUNDI ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FEET HIGHER THAN THE NEIGHBOURING HEIGHTS NORTHWARD FROM MAGALA CAPE THE LAKE STREAMED AWAY BETWEEN TWO CHAINS OF MOUNTAINS BOTH MEETING IN A POINT ABOUT THIRTY MILES NORTH OF US
2039-141208-0028 BUT LIABLE TO SUDDEN AND ETERNAL DEPARTURE THE MUTWARE CAME TO SEE US LATE IN THE AFTERNOON DRESSED WITH GREAT POMP HE TURNED OUT TO BE A BOY WHOM I HAD NOTICED IN THE CROWD OF GAZERS FOR HIS GOOD LOOKS AND FINE TEETH WHICH HE SHOWED
2039-141208-0029 BEING ADDICTED TO LAUGHING CONTINUALLY THERE WAS NO MISTAKING HIM THOUGH HE WAS NOW DECORATED WITH MANY IVORY ORNAMENTS WITH NECKLACES AND WITH HEAVY BRASS BRACELETS AND IRON WIRE ANKLETS OUR ADMIRATION OF HIM WAS RECIPROCATED
2039-141208-0030 HE GAVE A FINE FAT AND BROAD TAILED SHEEP AND A POT OF MILK IN OUR CONDITION BOTH WERE EXTREMELY ACCEPTABLE AT MAGALA WE HEARD OF A WAR RAGING BETWEEN MUKAMBA FOR WHOSE COUNTRY WE WERE BOUND AND WARUMASHANYA A SULTAN OF AN ADJOINING DISTRICT
2039-141208-0031 AND WE WERE ADVISED THAT UNLESS WE INTENDED TO ASSIST ONE OF THESE CHIEFS AGAINST THE OTHER IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR US TO RETURN BUT AS WE HAD STARTED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THE RUSIZI RIVER SUCH CONSIDERATIONS HAD NO WEIGHT WITH US ON THE EIGHTH MORNING FROM LEAVING UJIJI
2039-141208-0032 AND SET OFF FOR MUKAMBA'S COUNTRY WHICH WAS IN VIEW SOON AFTER PASSING THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN URUNDI PROPER
2039-141208-0033 A STORM FROM THE SOUTH WEST AROSE AND THE FEARFUL YAWING OF OUR CANOE INTO THE WAVE TROUGH WARNED US FROM PROCEEDING FURTHER SO WE TURNED HER HEAD FOR KISUKA VILLAGE ABOUT FOUR MILES NORTH
2039-141208-0034 ONE CHIEF MAKES A RAID INTO THE OTHER'S COUNTRY AND SUCCEEDS IN MAKING OFF WITH A HERD OF CATTLE KILLING ONE OR TWO MEN WHO HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
2039-141208-0035 AND EFFECTS A CAPTURE IN A SIMILAR WAY AND THEN A BALANCE IS STRUCK IN WHICH NEITHER IS THE GAINER SELDOM DO THEY ATTACK EACH OTHER WITH COURAGE AND HEARTY GOODWILL THE CONSTITUTION OF THE AFRICAN BEING DECIDEDLY AGAINST ANY SUCH ENERGETIC WARFARE
2039-141208-0036 THIS MGWANA FURTHER UPON BEING QUESTIONED GAVE US INFORMATION FAR MORE INTERESTING VIZ ABOUT THE RUSIZI HE TOLD US POSITIVELY WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO KNEW ALL ABOUT IT
2039-141208-0037 AND AS IF ANYBODY WHO DOUBTED HIM MIGHT WELL BE SET DOWN AS AN EGREGIOUS ASS THAT THE RUSIZI RIVER FLOWED OUT OF THE LAKE AWAY TO SUNA'S
2039-141208-0038 COUNTRY WHERE ELSE COULD IT FLOW TO HE ASKED THE DOCTOR WAS INCLINED TO BELIEVE IT OR PERHAPS HE WAS MORE INCLINED TO LET IT REST AS STATED UNTIL OUR OWN EYES SHOULD CONFIRM IT I WAS MORE INCLINED TO DOUBT AS I TOLD THE DOCTOR
2039-141208-0039 FIRST IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE SECOND THE FELLOW WAS TOO ENTHUSIASTIC UPON A SUBJECT THAT COULD NOT POSSIBLY INTEREST HIM
2039-141208-0040 AND THEN A THIRD MOUTH EACH ONLY A FEW YARDS BROAD BUT EACH DISCHARGING SUFFICIENT WATER TO PERMIT OUR FOLLOWING THE LINE OF THE CURRENTS SEVERAL RODS NORTH BEYOND THE RESPECTIVE MOUTHS
2039-141208-0041 THESE WERE MUKAMBA'S AND IN ONE OF THEM LIVED MUKAMBA THE CHIEF
2039-141208-0042 WE WERE SURROUNDED BY A LARGE CONCOURSE ALL ARMED WITH LONG SPEARS THE ONLY WEAPON VISIBLE AMONGST THEM SAVE A CLUB STICK AND HERE AND THERE A HATCHET WE WERE SHOWN INTO A HUT WHICH THE DOCTOR AND I SHARED BETWEEN US
2039-141208-0043 WHAT FOLLOWED ON THAT DAY I HAVE BUT A DIM RECOLLECTION HAVING BEEN STRUCK DOWN BY FEVER
2039-141208-0044 AND FELT OR FANCIED I FELT LIVINGSTONE'S HAND TENDERLY FEELING MY HOT HEAD AND LIMBS
2039-141208-0045 WITHOUT ANYTHING OR ANYBODY TO RELIEVE ME OF THE TEDIOUS RACKING HEADACHE AND PAIN OR TO ILLUMINE THE DARK AND GLOOMY PROSPECT WHICH MUST NECESSARILY SURROUND THE BEDSIDE OF THE SICK AND SOLITARY TRAVELLER BUT THOUGH THIS FEVER HAVING ENJOYED IMMUNITY FROM IT FOR THREE MONTHS
2039-141208-0046 WAS MORE SEVERE THAN USUAL I DID NOT MUCH REGRET ITS OCCURRENCE SINCE I BECAME THE RECIPIENT OF THE VERY TENDER AND FATHERLY KINDNESS OF THE GOOD MAN WHOSE COMPANION I NOW FOUND MYSELF THE NEXT MORNING HAVING RECOVERED SLIGHTLY FROM THE FEVER
2039-141208-0047 AND HE WAS NOT A WHIT ABASHED WHEN THROUGH HIM THE CHIEF TOLD US THAT THE RUSIZI JOINED BY THE RUANDA OR LUANDA AT A DISTANCE OF TWO DAYS JOURNEY BY WATER OR ONE DAY BY LAND FROM THE HEAD OF THE LAKE FLOWED INTO THE LAKE
2039-141208-0048 THUS OUR HOPES EXCITED SOMEWHAT BY THE POSITIVE AND REPEATED ASSURANCES THAT THE RIVER FLOWED OUT AWAY TOWARDS KARAGWAH COLLAPSED AS SPEEDILY AS THEY WERE RAISED
2039-141208-0049 BUT WITH A GOOD NATURED LAUGH THE DOCTOR SCOUTED ALL SUCH RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM AS IT WAS INSTITUTED ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DRAWING MORE CLOTH OUT OF HIM MUKAMBA TOOK IT IN GOOD PART AND DID NOT INSIST ON GETTING MORE OUR SECOND EVENING AT MUKAMBA'S
2039-141208-0050 SUSI THE DOCTOR'S SERVANT GOT GLORIOUSLY DRUNK THROUGH THE CHIEF'S LIBERAL AND PROFUSE GIFTS OF POMBE JUST AT DAWN NEAT MORNING I WAS AWAKENED BY HEARING SEVERAL SHARP CRACK LIKE SOUNDS I LISTENED AND I FOUND THE NOISE WAS IN OUR HUT
2039-141208-0051 IT WAS CAUSED BY THE DOCTOR WHO TOWARDS MIDNIGHT HAD FELT SOME ONE COME AND LIE DOWN BY HIS SIDE ON THE SAME BED AND THINKING IT WAS ME HE HAD KINDLY MADE ROOM AND LAID DOWN ON THE EDGE OF THE BED
2039-141208-0052 WHO TAKING POSSESSION OF HIS BLANKETS AND FOLDING THEM ABOUT HIMSELF MOST SELFISHLY WAS OCCUPYING ALMOST THE WHOLE BED THE DOCTOR WITH THAT GENTLENESS CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM INSTEAD OF TAKING A ROD HAD CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SLAPPING SUSI ON THE BACK SAYING
2039-141208-0053 GET UP SUSI WILL YOU YOU ARE IN MY BED HOW DARE YOU SIR GET DRUNK IN THIS WAY AFTER I HAVE TOLD YOU SO OFTEN NOT TO
2039-141208-0054 TAKE THAT AND THAT AND THAT STILL SUSI SLEPT AND GRUNTED
2039-141208-0055 WE EMBARKED AND PULLED ACROSS
2039-141208-0056 THE COUNTRY OF RUHINGA MUKAMBA'S ELDER BROTHER IN LOOKING BACK TO WHERE WE HAD COME FROM WE PERCEIVED THAT WE HAD MADE A DIAGONAL CUT ACROSS FROM SOUTH EAST TO NORTH WEST INSTEAD OF HAVING MADE A DIRECT EAST AND WEST COURSE OR IN OTHER WORDS
2039-141208-0057 WE HAD COME TO MUGIHEWA SITUATED AT THE NORTHERNMOST POINT OF THE WESTERN SHORE
2039-141208-0058 BUT BY MAKING A DIAGONAL COURSE
2039-141208-0059 AND THE TALLEST OF PAPYRUS AND POND LIKE HOLLOWS FILLED WITH STAGNANT WATER WHICH EMIT MALARIA WHOLESALE LARGE HERDS OF CATTLE ARE REARED ON IT FOR WHERE THE GROUND IS NOT COVERED WITH MARSHY PLANTS IT PRODUCES RICH SWEET GRASS
2039-141208-0060 THE SHEEP AND GOATS ESPECIALLY THE FORMER ARE ALWAYS IN GOOD CONDITION AND THOUGH THEY ARE NOT TO BE COMPARED WITH ENGLISH OR AMERICAN SHEEP THEY ARE THE FINEST I HAVE SEEN IN AFRICA NUMEROUS VILLAGES ARE SEEN ON THIS LAND BECAUSE THE INTERVENING SPACES
2039-141208-0061 ARE NOT OCCUPIED WITH THE RANK AND LUXURIANT JUNGLE COMMON IN OTHER PARTS OF AFRICA
2039-141208-0062 FROM THE BANKS I COUNTED TEN HEADS OF CROCODILES
2039-141208-0063 RUHINGA WHO CAME TO SEE US SOON AFTER WE HAD TAKEN UP OUR QUARTERS IN HIS VILLAGE WAS A MOST AMIABLE MAN WHO ALWAYS CONTRIVED TO SEE SOMETHING
2039-141208-0064 HE WAS NOT HALF SO DIGNIFIED NOR REGARDED WITH SO MUCH ADMIRATION
2039-141208-0065 SECOND MUKANIGI GOVERNED BY WARUMASHANYA
2039-141208-0066 EXTENDING TO THE EASTERN BANK OF THE RUSIZI FOURTH COMMENCING FROM THE WESTERN BANK OF THE RUSIZI TO THE EXTREME NORTH WESTERN HEAD OF THE LAKE WAS MUGIHEWA RUHINGA'S COUNTRY FIFTH FROM UVIRA ON THE WEST RUNNING NORTH PAST MUGIHEWA
2039-141208-0067 AND OVERLAPPING IT ON THE NORTH SIDE AS FAR AS THE HILLS OF CHAMATI WAS RUWENGA ALSO A COUNTRY GOVERNED BY MUKAMBA BEYOND RUWENGA FROM THE HILLS OF CHAMATI TO THE RUANDA RIVER WAS THE COUNTRY OF CHAMATI
