4263-16187-0000 TWO WHIP POOR WILLS WERE UTTERING THEIR INSISTENT NOTE
4263-16187-0001 THE SKY IN THE WEST STILL GLOWED WITH AMBER LIGHT AND THE CRESCENT MOON FLOATED LIKE A GOLDEN BOAT ABOVE THE HORIZON'S EDGE
4263-16187-0002 THE LAMPS WITHIN WERE UNLIGHTED AND THE EVENING WIND BLEW THE WHITE MUSLIN CURTAINS OUT
4263-16187-0003 THE PORCH WAS LOW ONLY A STEP FROM THE GROUND
4263-16187-0004 FELT SOFT AND COOL TO THE BARE FEET OF THE CHILDREN IN FRONT AND ALL AROUND LAY THE GARDEN FLOWERS AND FRUIT QUAINTLY INTERMINGLED DOWN THE LONG PATH TO THE GATE WHERE THREE ROADS MET GREAT BUNCHES OF PEONIES LIFTED WHITE BLOSSOMS
4263-16187-0005 LUMINOUSLY WHITE IN THE MOONLIGHT AND ON EITHER SIDE ROWS OF CURRANT BUSHES CAST LOW DARK SHADOWS AND HERE AND THERE DWARF CRAB APPLE TREES TOSSED PALE SCENTED FLOWERS ABOVE THEM
4263-16187-0006 THE CHILDREN CHATTERED QUIETLY AT THEIR PLAY AS IF THEY FELT A MYSTERY AROUND THEM AND SMALL BETTY WAS SURE SHE SAW FAIRIES DANCING ON THE IRIS FLOWERS WHEN THE LIGHT BREEZE STIRRED THEM BUT OF THIS SHE SAID NOTHING
4263-16187-0007 LEST HER PRACTICAL OLDER SISTER SHOULD DROP A SCORNFUL WORD OF UNBELIEF A THING BETTY SHRANK FROM AND INSTINCTIVELY AVOIDED WHY SHOULD SHE BE TOLD THERE WERE NO SUCH THINGS AS FAIRIES AND GOBLINS AND PIGWIDGEONS
4263-16187-0008 WHEN ONE MIGHT BE AT THAT VERY MOMENT DANCING AT HER ELBOW AND HEAR IT ALL SO BETTY WAGGED HER CURLY GOLDEN HEAD WISE WITH THE WISDOM OF CHILDHOOD AND WENT HER OWN WAYS AND THOUGHT HER OWN THOUGHTS AS FOR THE STRANGE CREATURES OF WONDROUS POWER THAT PEOPLED THE EARTH
4263-16187-0009 DID SHE NOT OFTEN GO WHEN THE SUN WAS SETTING AND CLIMB THE FENCE BEHIND THE BARN UNDER THE
4263-16187-0010 WHERE NONE COULD SEE HER AND WATCH THE FIERY GRIFFINS IN THE WEST COULD SHE NOT SEE THEM FLAME AND FLASH THEIR WINGS SPREADING FAR OUT ACROSS THE SKY IN FANTASTIC FLIGHT
4263-16187-0011 COULD SHE NOT SEE THE FLYING MIST WOMEN FLINGING THEIR FLOATING ROBES OF SOFTEST PINK AND PALEST GREEN AROUND THEIR SLENDER LIMBS AND TRAILING THEM DELICATELY ACROSS THE DEEPENING SKY HAD SHE NOT HEARD THE GIANTS NAY SEEN THEM
4263-16187-0012 UNDER HUGE ROLLING MACHINES A THOUSAND TIMES BIGGER THAN THAT FARMER HOPKINS USED TO CRUSH THE CLODS IN HIS WHEAT FIELD IN THE SPRING
4263-16187-0013 AH SHE KNEW IF MARTHA WOULD ONLY LISTEN TO HER SHE COULD SHOW HER SOME OF THESE TRUE THINGS AND STOP HER SCOFFING LURED BY THESE MYSTERIES BETTY MADE SHORT EXCURSIONS INTO THE GARDEN AWAY FROM THE OTHERS
4263-16187-0014 PEERING AMONG THE SHADOWS AND GAZING WIDE EYED INTO THE CLUSTERS OF IRIS FLOWERS ABOVE WHICH NIGHT MOTHS FLUTTERED SOFTLY AND SILENTLY MAYBE THERE WERE FAIRIES THERE THREE COULD RIDE AT ONCE ON THE BACK OF A DEVIL'S RIDING HORSE SHE KNEW
4263-16187-0015 AND IN THE DAYTIME THEY RODE THE DRAGON FLIES TWO AT A TIME THEY WERE SO LIGHT IT WAS NOTHING FOR THE GREAT GREEN AND GOLD BIG EYED DRAGON FLIES TO CARRY TWO BETTY KNEW A PLACE BELOW THE SPRING WHERE THE MAIDENHAIR FERN GREW THICK AND SPREAD OUT WIDE PERFECT FRONDS ON SLENDER BROWN STEMS
4263-16187-0016 AND WHERE TALLER FERNS GREW HIGH AND LEANED OVER LIKE A DELICATE FAIRY FOREST AND WHERE THE WILD VIOLETS GREW SO THICK YOU COULD NOT SEE THE GROUND BENEATH THEM AND THE GRASS WAS LUSH AND LONG LIKE FINE GREEN HAIR AND CREPT UP THE HILLSIDE AND OVER THE ROOTS OF THE MAPLE AND BASSWOOD TREES
4263-16187-0017 HERE LIVED THE ELVES SHE KNEW THEM WELL AND OFTEN LAY WITH HER HEAD AMONG THE VIOLETS LISTENING FOR THE THIN SOUND OF THEIR ELFIN FIDDLES OFTEN SHE HAD DROWSED THE SUMMER NOON IN THE COOLNESS
4263-16187-0018 UNHEEDING THE DINNER CALL UNTIL BUSY MARTHA ROUSED HER WITH THE SISTERLY SCOLDING SHE KNEW SHE DESERVED AND TOOK IN GOOD PART NOW AS BETTY CREPT CAUTIOUSLY ABOUT PEERING AND HOPING WITH A HALF FEARING EXPECTATION A SWEET THREADLIKE WAIL
4263-16187-0019 TREMBLED OUT TOWARD HER ACROSS THE MOONLIT AND SHADOWED SPACE HER FATHER WAS TUNING HIS VIOLIN HER MOTHER SAT AT HIS SIDE HUSHING BOBBY IN HER ARMS
4263-16187-0020 NOW THE PLAINTIVE CALL OF THE VIOLIN CAME STRONGER AND SHE HASTENED BACK TO CURL UP AT HER FATHER'S FEET AND LISTEN SHE CLOSED HER VISION SEEING EYES AND LEANED AGAINST HER FATHER'S KNEE
4263-16187-0021 AND AS THE SEASON ADVANCED SHE WOULD BE BUSIER STILL
4263-16187-0022 EACH BRINGING AN ADVANCING CRESCENDO OF WORK BUT OH THE HAPPY DAYS FOR BETTY LIVED IN A WORLD ALL HER OWN WHEREIN HER PLAY WAS AS REAL AS HER WORK AND LABOR WAS TURNED BY HER IMAGINATIVE LITTLE MIND INTO NEW FORMS OF PLAY
4263-16187-0023 AND ALTHOUGH NIGHT OFTEN FOUND HER WEARY TOO TIRED TO LIE QUIETLY IN HER BED SOMETIMES THE LINE BETWEEN THE TWO WAS NEVER IN HER THOUGHTS DISTINCTLY DRAWN
4263-16187-0024 MADE HER WISH WITH ALL THE INTENSITY OF HER SENSITIVE SOUL THAT SHE MIGHT CONFESS TO SOME ONE WHAT SHE HAD DONE
4263-16187-0025 SO SHE TRIED TO REPENT VERY HARD AND TELL GOD ALL ABOUT IT SOMEHOW IT WAS ALWAYS EASIER TO TELL GOD ABOUT THINGS FOR SHE REASONED IF GOD WAS EVERYWHERE AND KNEW EVERYTHING THEN HE KNEW SHE HAD BEEN BAD AND HAD SEEN HER ALL THE TIME
4263-16187-0026 AND SHE TURNED AND KISSED THEM FIRST ONE AND THEN THE OTHER WITH EAGER KISSES
4263-16187-0027 DON'T WAKE HIM DEAR SAID HER MOTHER
4263-16187-0028 AND HID HER FACE ON THEM WHILE SHE REPENTED VERY HARD
4263-16187-0029 CLIMBING BEHIND HIM AND GUIDING HIS LITTLE FEET FROM ONE RUNG OF THE PERPENDICULAR LADDER TO ANOTHER TEACHING HIM TO CLING WITH CLENCHED HANDS TO THE ROUNDS UNTIL SHE HAD LANDED HIM IN THE LOFT THERE SHE HAD PERSUADED HIM HE WAS A SWALLOW IN HIS NEST
4263-16187-0030 WHILE SHE HAD TAKEN HER FILL OF THE DELIGHT OF LEAPING FROM THE LOFT DOWN INTO THE BAY WHERE SHE HAD FIRST TOSSED ENOUGH HAY TO MAKE A SOFT LIGHTING PLACE FOR THE TWELVE FOOT LEAP OH THE JOY OF IT FLYING THROUGH THE AIR IF SHE COULD ONLY FLY UP INSTEAD OF DOWN
4263-16187-0031 SO BOBBY SAT STILL AND WHEN SHE RETURNED OBEDIENTLY OPENED HIS MOUTH BUT ALAS HE WEARIED OF HIS ROLE IN THE PLAY
4263-16187-0032 NOW AS SHE SAT CLASPING HER KNEES HER LITTLE BODY GREW ALL TREMBLING AND WEAK AGAIN AS SHE LIVED OVER THE TERRIBLE MOMENT WHEN SHE HAD REACHED HIM JUST IN TIME TO DRAG HIM BACK FROM THE EDGE AND TO CUDDLE AND CARESS HIM UNTIL HE LIFTED UP HIS VOICE AND WEPT NOT BECAUSE HE WAS IN THE LEAST TROUBLED OR HURT
4263-16187-0033 AND WHEN SHE RELUCTANTLY BROUGHT HIM BACK TO DINNER HOW SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN GETTING HIM DOWN FROM THE LOFT WOULD MAKE A CHAPTER OF DIPLOMACY HER MOTHER REPROVED HER FOR ALLOWING HIM TO TAKE IT AND LAPPED THE TWO PIECES AND WOUND THEM ABOUT WITH THREAD AND TOLD HER SHE MUST WEAR THE BROKEN COMB AFTER THIS SHE WAS GLAD
4263-16187-0034 GLAD IT WAS BROKEN AND SHE HAD TREASURED IT SO AND GLAD THAT HER MOTHER HAD SCOLDED HER
4263-16187-0035 THUS SHE TORTURED HERSELF AND REPENTED VERY HARD THE OTHER SIN SHE HAD THAT DAY COMMITTED SHE FELT TO BE A DOUBLE SIN BECAUSE SHE KNEW ALL THE TIME IT WAS WRONG AND DID IT DELIBERATELY
4263-16187-0036 OF ROBERT BURNS POEMS THESE POEMS SHE LOVED NOT THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THEM
4263-16187-0037 UNCHILDISH FEAR CREPT OVER HER A FEAR OF THE YEARS TO COME SO LONG AND ENDLESS THEY WOULD BE ALWAYS COMING COMING ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND HERE SHE WAS NEVER TO STOP LIVING AND EVERY DAY DOING SOMETHING THAT SHE OUGHT NOT AND EVERY EVENING REPENTING IT
4263-16187-0038 AND HER FATHER MIGHT STOP LOVING HER AND HER SISTER MIGHT STOP LOVING HER AND HER LITTLE BROTHER MIGHT STOP LOVING HER AND BOBBY MIGHT DIE
