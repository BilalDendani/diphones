4973-24516-0000 MILES AND MILES OF PASSAGES ARE THERE SOME LOW AND NARROW OTHERS WIDE AND LOFTY THEY CROSS AND RE CROSS EACH OTHER LIKE THE STREETS OF A TOWN AND ALL ARE SCOOPED OUT OF THE SOLID EARTH
4973-24516-0001 THAT IS IN PEACE FOR ALL THIS GREAT UNDERGROUND CITY IS IN REALITY ONE HUGE CEMETERY THE QUIET RESTING PLACE WHERE THE FIRST CHRISTIANS OF HEATHEN ROME BURIED THEIR DEAD WHERE THE MARTYRED BODIES SO CRUELLY TORTURED BY NERO WERE LAID AT LAST
4973-24516-0002 FOR THE MOURNERS GRIEVE TO THINK THAT THE LOVED ONE WILL OPEN HIS EYES ON EARTH NO MORE BUT IN ALL THE HOPE OF ETERNAL LIFE IS SURE AND CERTAIN OUR BELOVED MOTHER OUR LITTLE CHILD OUR DEAR BROTHER IS WITH CHRIST THE PARTING IS ONLY FOR A TIME
4973-24516-0003 YONDER IN OUR BEAUTIFUL HEAVENLY HOME WE SHALL MEET ONCE MORE HOW DIFFERENT FROM THE WORDS CARVED OVER HEATHEN TOMBS WE KNOW WHAT THESE WERE LIKE FOR NOT VERY FAR AWAY IS A HEATHEN CATACOMB
4973-24516-0004 VALERIA SLEEPS IN PEACE SO THE CHRISTIAN WOMAN WAS LAID TO REST I LIFT UP MY HANDS AGAINST GOD WHO SNATCHED ME AWAY WE CAN STILL READ THESE DESPAIRING REBELLIOUS WORDS ON A HEATHEN TOMB
4973-24516-0005 AND BELIEVE THAT IT IS FORBIDDEN TO WEEP FOR ONE WHO LIVES IN GOD HOW BEAUTIFUL TO KNOW THAT WE SHALL ONE DAY MEET THE WOMAN IN HEAVEN OF WHOM THESE WORDS ARE WRITTEN
4973-24516-0006 THE CHRISTIANS OF ROME BEGAN TO USE THE CATACOMBS FOR MEETINGS AND SERVICES THEIR HEATHEN TORMENTORS HAD A HORROR OF DEATH AND THEREFORE AMONG THE QUIET DEAD THE CHRISTIANS WERE SAFE FOR A WHILE
4973-24516-0007 THEIR LITTLE OIL LAMPS TWINKLING LIKE STARS AND THERE THEY LISTENED TO THE WORD OF GOD AND PRAYED AND SANG TOGETHER MANY TOUCHING STORIES ARE TOLD OF THESE DAYS AND OF THE MEETINGS HELD UNDERGROUND IN THESE CATACOMBS WHERE THE LIVING WERE SURROUNDED BY THE BODIES OF THE MARTYRED DEAD
4973-24516-0008 NOW THESE FIRST CHRISTIANS LOVED THE BIBLE WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS AND JUST AS YOU LIKE TO SEE HANGING IN YOUR ROOM THE PICTURE OF THE GOOD SHEPHERD WITH THE LITTLE LAMB SO THEY BEGAN TO LONG FOR PICTURES FROM THEIR BIBLE
4973-24516-0009 EVERY HEATHEN ROMAN HAD HIS HOUSE DECORATED WITH PICTURES AND CARVINGS FROM HIS PAGAN RELIGION BUT IT WAS IN THE DIM UNDERGROUND GALLERIES THAT THE FIRST BIBLE PICTURES APPEARED SOME OF THE SUBJECTS WERE TAKEN FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT SOME FROM THE NEW
4973-24516-0010 ONLY BIBLE PICTURES INTERESTED THE FIRST CHRISTIANS
4973-24516-0011 CHRIST THE GOOD SHEPHERD OF YOUR LIFE JUST AS SURELY AS HE WAS THE SAVIOUR AND FRIEND OF THESE MEN AND WOMEN WHO FELL ASLEEP SO LONG AGO
4973-24516-0012 IN THIS CARVING HE IS CHANGING THE WATER INTO WINE HERE CARVED ON A SMALL PANEL LET INTO A TOMB IS A ROMAN SOLDIER CROWNING OUR LORD IN MOCKERY
4973-24516-0013 NOW THERE IS ONE VERY WONDERFUL THING ABOUT ALL THESE PICTURES ALTHOUGH SO MANY MARTYRS LIE BURIED HERE NEARLY ALL THE PICTURES AND INSCRIPTIONS ARE CHEERFUL THE HEATHEN ROMAN WRITERS TELL A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE DREADFUL SUFFERINGS OF THE CHRISTIANS
4973-24516-0014 BUT THERE IS VERY LITTLE SAID ABOUT IT ON THE TOMBS OF THE MARTYRS THEMSELVES IN PEACE THEY ARE AT PEACE THE TORTURE THE SHAME IS OVER FOR EVER THE LIFE OF LOVE AND JOY AND VICTORY IS ALL BEFORE THEM
4973-24516-0015 HOW THOROUGHLY THESE FIRST CHRISTIANS KNEW THEIR BIBLE HOW THEY LOVED TO PICTURE ITS SCENES HAD ALL THE WRITINGS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT BEEN LOST WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENTS OF OUR LORD'S LIFE ON EARTH FROM THESE FADED PAINTINGS AND WORN CARVINGS ALONE LOVE
