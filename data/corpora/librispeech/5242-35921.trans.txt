5242-35921-0000 DOES THE PROMISE UTTERED BY THE MASTER OF MANKIND UPON THE EVE OF THE END WHOSO THAT BELIEVETH IN ME THE WORKS THAT I DO HE SHALL DO ALSO AND WHATSOEVER YE SHALL ASK IN MY NAME THAT WILL I DO STILL HOLD GOOD TO SUCH AS DO ASK AND DO BELIEVE
5242-35921-0001 AND OF THAT STRANGE MAN WHO CARRIED ON AND COMPLETED HIS WORK ANSWER THIS QUESTION ACCORDING TO THEIR JUDGMENT THE TIME WAS A SUNDAY AFTERNOON IN SUMMER AND THE PLACE A CHURCH IN THE MIDLAND COUNTIES
5242-35921-0002 IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL CHURCH ANCIENT AND SPACIOUS MOREOVER IT HAD RECENTLY BEEN RESTORED AT GREAT COST SEVEN OR EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE COULD HAVE FOUND SITTINGS IN IT AND DOUBTLESS THEY HAD DONE SO WHEN BUSSCOMBE WAS A LARGE MANUFACTURING TOWN
5242-35921-0003 BEFORE THE FAILURE OF THE COAL SUPPLY AND OTHER CAUSES DROVE AWAY ITS TRADE NOW IT WAS MUCH WHAT IT HAD BEEN IN THE TIME OF THE NORMANS A LITTLE AGRICULTURAL VILLAGE WITH A POPULATION OF THREE HUNDRED SOULS OUT OF THIS POPULATION INCLUDING THE CHOIR BOYS
5242-35921-0004 EXACTLY THIRTY NINE HAD ELECTED TO ATTEND CHURCH ON THIS PARTICULAR SUNDAY AND OF THESE THREE WERE FAST ASLEEP AND FOUR WERE DOZING
5242-35921-0005 FOR ANOTHER CLERGYMAN WAS PREACHING AND AS HE COUNTED BITTERNESS AND DISAPPOINTMENT TOOK HOLD OF HIM THE PREACHER WAS A DEPUTATION
5242-35921-0006 SENT BY ONE OF THE LARGE MISSIONARY SOCIETIES TO AROUSE THE INDIFFERENT TO A SENSE OF DUTY TOWARDS THEIR UNCONVERTED BLACK BRETHREN IN AFRICA AND INCIDENTALLY TO COLLECT CASH TO BE SPENT IN THE CONVERSION OF THE SAID BRETHREN
5242-35921-0007 AND HAD LABOURED HARD TO SECURE HIM A GOOD AUDIENCE BUT THE BEAUTY OF THE WEATHER OR TERROR OF THE INEVITABLE SUBSCRIPTION PREVAILED AGAINST HIM HENCE HIS DISAPPOINTMENT WELL HE THOUGHT WITH A SIGH I HAVE DONE MY BEST AND I MUST MAKE IT UP OUT OF MY OWN POCKET
5242-35921-0008 THEN HE SETTLED HIMSELF TO LISTEN TO THE SERMON THE PREACHER A BATTERED LOOKING INDIVIDUAL OF BETWEEN FIFTY AND SIXTY YEARS OF AGE WAS GAUNT WITH RECENT SICKNESS PATIENT AND UNIMAGINATIVE IN ASPECT
5242-35921-0009 HE PREACHED EXTEMPORARILY WITH THE AID OF NOTES AND IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS REMARKABLE FOR INTEREST AT ANY RATE IN ITS BEGINNING DOUBTLESS THE SPARSE CONGREGATION SO PRONE TO SLUMBER DISCOURAGED HIM
5242-35921-0010 FOR OFFERING EXHORTATIONS TO EMPTY BENCHES IS BUT WEARY WORK INDEED HE WAS MEDITATING THE ADVISABILITY OF BRINGING HIS ARGUMENT TO AN ABRUPT CONCLUSION WHEN CHANCING TO GLANCE ROUND HE BECAME AWARE THAT HE HAD AT LEAST ONE SYMPATHETIC LISTENER
5242-35921-0011 FROM THAT MOMENT THE SERMON IMPROVED BY DEGREES TILL AT LENGTH IT REACHED A REALLY HIGH LEVEL OF EXCELLENCE CEASING FROM RHETORIC THE SPEAKER BEGAN TO TELL OF HIS OWN EXPERIENCE AND SUFFERINGS IN THE CAUSE AMONGST SAVAGE TRIBES
5242-35921-0012 FOR HE HIMSELF WAS A MISSIONARY OF MANY YEARS STANDING HE TOLD HOW ONCE HE AND A COMPANION HAD BEEN SENT TO A NATION WHO NAMED THEMSELVES THE SONS OF FIRE BECAUSE THEIR GOD WAS THE LIGHTNING
5242-35921-0013 IF INDEED THEY COULD BE SAID TO BOAST ANY GODS OTHER THAN THE SPEAR AND THE KING IN SIMPLE LANGUAGE HE NARRATED HIS TERRIBLE ADVENTURES AMONG THESE SAVAGES
5242-35921-0014 AND HIS OWN FLIGHT FOR HIS LIFE
5242-35921-0015 BUT THIS IS BY THE WAY HE WENT ON FOR MY SOCIETY DOES NOT ASK YOU TO SUBSCRIBE TOWARDS THE CONVERSION OF THE CHILDREN OF FIRE UNTIL THAT PEOPLE IS CONQUERED WHICH VERY LIKELY WILL NOT BE FOR GENERATIONS SEEING THAT THEY LIVE IN CENTRAL AFRICA
5242-35921-0016 OCCUPYING A TERRITORY THAT WHITE MEN DO NOT DESIRE NO MISSIONARY WILL DARE AGAIN TO VISIT THEM AT THIS MOMENT SOMETHING CAUSED HIM TO LOOK A SECOND TIME AT THOMAS OWEN HE WAS LEANING FORWARD IN HIS PLACE LISTENING EAGERLY
5242-35921-0017 AND A STRANGE LIGHT FILLED THE LARGE DARK EYES THAT SHONE IN THE PALLOR OF HIS DELICATE NERVOUS FACE THERE IS A MAN WHO WOULD DARE IF HE WERE PUT TO IT THOUGHT THE DEPUTATION TO HIMSELF THEN HE ENDED HIS SERMON
5242-35921-0018 THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SAT AT DINNER IN THE RECTORY IT WAS A VERY FINE RECTORY BEAUTIFULLY FURNISHED FOR OWEN WAS A MAN OF TASTE WHICH HE HAD THE MEANS TO GRATIFY ALSO ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALONE THE DINNER WAS GOOD
5242-35921-0019 SO GOOD THAT THE POOR BROKEN DOWN MISSIONARY SIPPING HIS UNACCUSTOMED PORT A VINTAGE WINE SIGHED ALOUD IN ADMIRATION AND INVOLUNTARY ENVY WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED OWEN NOTHING MISTER OWEN

5242-35921-0029 AND DID THEY TREAT YOU BADLY WHEN YOU FIRST VISITED THEM NOT AT FIRST THEY RECEIVED US CIVILLY ENOUGH AND ON A GIVEN DAY WE WERE REQUESTED TO EXPLAIN TO THE KING AND THE COUNCIL OF WIZARDS THE RELIGION WHICH WE CAME TO TEACH

5242-35921-0031 HE WAS NAMED HOKOSA A TALL THIN MAN WITH A SPIRITUAL FACE AND TERRIBLE CALM EYES YOU SPEAK WELL SON OF A WHITE MAN HE SAID BUT LET US PASS FROM WORDS TO DEEDS
5242-35921-0032 YOU TELL US THAT THIS GOD OF YOURS WHOM YOU DESIRE THAT WE SHOULD TAKE AS OUR GOD SO THAT YOU MAY BECOME HIS CHIEF PROPHETS IN THE LAND WAS A WIZARD SUCH AS WE ARE THOUGH GRATER THAN WE ARE FOR NOT ONLY DID HE KNOW THE PAST AND THE FUTURE AS WE DO
5242-35921-0033 BUT ALSO HE COULD CURE THOSE WHO WERE SMITTEN WITH HOPELESS SICKNESS AND RAISE THOSE WHO WERE DEAD WHICH WE CANNOT DO YOU TELL US MOREOVER THAT BY FAITH THOSE WHO BELIEVE ON HIM CAN DO WORKS AS GREAT AS HE DID AND THAT YOU DO BELIEVE ON HIM
5242-35921-0034 THEREFORE WE WILL PUT YOU TO THE PROOF HO THERE LEAD FORTH THAT EVIL ONE AS HE SPOKE A MAN WAS PLACED BEFORE US ONE WHO HAD BEEN CONVICTED OF WITCHCRAFT OR SOME OTHER CRIME KILL HIM SAID HOKOSA

5242-35921-0037 OUT OF YOUR OWN MOUTHS ARE YOU JUDGED WHITE MEN CHOOSE WHICH HORN OF THE BULL YOU WILL YOU HANG TO ONE OF THEM AND IT SHALL PIERCE YOU THIS IS THE SENTENCE OF THE KING
5242-35921-0038 I SPEAK IT WHO AM THE KING'S MOUTH THAT YOU WHITE MAN WHO HAVE SPOKEN TO US AND CHEATED US THESE TWO WEARY DAYS BE PUT TO DEATH AND THAT YOU HIS COMPANION WHO HAVE BEEN SILENT BE DRIVEN FROM THE LAND
5242-35921-0039 THEY GAVE MY POOR FRIEND TEN MINUTES TO TALK TO HIS SPIRIT THEN THEY SPEARED HIM BEFORE MY FACE AFTER IT WAS OVER HOKOSA SPOKE TO ME SAYING GO BACK WHITE MAN TO THOSE WHO SENT YOU AND TELL THEM THE WORDS OF THE SONS OF FIRE
5242-35921-0040 THAT THEY HAVE LISTENED TO THE MESSAGE OF PEACE AND THOUGH THEY ARE A PEOPLE OF WARRIORS YET THEY THANK THEM FOR THAT MESSAGE FOR IN ITSELF IT SOUNDS GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL IN THEIR EARS IF IT BE TRUE TELL THEM THAT HAVING PROVED YOU LIARS
