4697-100174-0000 SALLIE HICKS'S FOREFINGER SALLIE HICKS WAS A LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS GOOD MOST OF THE TIME BUT SHE HAD ONE BAD HABIT AND THAT WAS CAUSED BY HER FOREFINGER ON HER RIGHT HAND
4697-100174-0001 SALLIE'S RIGHT HAND FOREFINGER WOULD GET INTO THINGS IT SHOULD NOT AND IT CAUSED SALLIE'S MOTHER A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE AND MOST OF SALLIE'S PUNISHMENTS WERE ON ACCOUNT OF THAT UNRULY RIGHT HAND FOREFINGER
4697-100174-0002 ONE DAY SALLIE'S MOTHER SET A DISH OF HOT JELLY ON THE KITCHEN TABLE TO COOL SHE TOLD SALLIE IT WAS HOT AND SHE MUST NOT TOUCH IT BUT NO SOONER WAS HER MOTHER OUT OF THE KITCHEN AND THE COOK'S HEAD WAS TURNED ANOTHER WAY
4697-100174-0003 THAN SALLIE HICKS FORGOT ALL ABOUT HER MOTHER'S WARNING AND THE NAUGHTY RIGHT HAND FOREFINGER WENT RIGHT INTO THE HOT JELLY OH HOW SALLIE SCREAMED WITH PAIN
4697-100174-0004 IT BURNED HER SO THE BIG TEARS RAN RIGHT DOWN SALLIE'S PRETTY PINK CHEEKS AND HER MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND COOK TOO CAME RUNNING TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER THE LITTLE FOREFINGER TOLD THE STORY
4697-100174-0005 AND IT HAD TO BE WRAPPED IN SOME COOLING SALVE AND A SOFT PIECE OF LINEN I TOLD YOU THAT SOME DAY YOU WOULD GET THAT FINGER BURNED SAID HER MOTHER AND NOW BECAUSE YOU DISOBEYED ME YOU MUST SIT IN THE BIG CHAIR IN THE HALL UNTIL LUNCH TIME AND NOT SPEAK TO ANYONE
4697-100174-0006 I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT NAUGHTY FINGER SALLIE'S GRANDMOTHER PASSED HER IN THE HALL AND LEANED OVER AND KISSED HER I AM SORRY THAT GRANDMOTHER'S LITTLE GIRL WAS SO NAUGHTY SHE SAID GOOD LITTLE GIRLS MIND THEIR MOTHERS
4697-100174-0007 AND THEY DON'T GET BURNT FINGERS SALLIE WATCHED HER GRANDMOTHER GO UPSTAIRS AND THEN SALLIE LOOKED AT THE PICTURE HANGING ON THE WALL OF HER GREAT GRANDMOTHER I WONDER IF GRANDMOTHER GREAT EVER HAD TO PUNISH GRANDMOTHER

4697-100174-0009 WHILE HER GRANDMOTHER AND GRANDFATHER TOO HAD WHITE HAIR SALLIE LOOKED AT THE FOREFINGER ALL WRAPPED ABOUT WITH THE WHITE CLOTH AND SHE THOUGHT HOW DREADFUL IT WOULD BE TO HAVE HER FINGER BIG AND LONG AS IT LOOKED NOW
4697-100174-0010 THEN SHE LOOKED AT GRANDMOTHER GREAT AGAIN AND HER EYES SEEMED TO BE LOOKING RIGHT AT THAT LITTLE BURNT FOREFINGER SALLIE PUT HER RIGHT HAND BEHIND HER BUT THE EYES OF GRANDMOTHER GREAT LOOKED RIGHT AT SALLIE
