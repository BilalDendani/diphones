4455-14896-0000 BUT THE UNDOUBTED ANTIQUITY OF THIS DOG IS PROVED BY THE FACT THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF A BREED SUFFICIENTLY SIMILAR TO BE CONSIDERED HIS ANCESTORS ARE FOUND ON SOME OF THE OLDEST EGYPTIAN MONUMENTS
4455-14896-0001 WHEN THE GERMANS CLAIMED FOR IT THE TITLE
4455-14896-0002 ULMER DOGGE AND ROTTWEILER METZGERHUND BUT CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THESE THERE EXISTED AS IN OTHER COUNTRIES IN EUROPE ANOTHER VERY BIG BREED BUT MUCH NOBLER AND MORE THOROUGHBRED KNOWN AS THE GREAT DANE
4455-14896-0003 WHEN AFTER THE WAR OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NATIONAL FEELING WAS PULSATING VERY STRONGLY IN THE VEINS OF REUNITED GERMANY THE GERMAN CYNOLOGISTS WERE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR A NATIONAL DOG AND FOR THAT PURPOSE THE GREAT DANE WAS RE CHRISTENED
4455-14896-0004 AND ELECTED AS THE CHAMPION OF GERMAN DOGDOM FOR A LONG TIME ALL THESE BREEDS HAD NO DOUBT BEEN INDISCRIMINATELY CROSSED THE GREAT DANE WAS INTRODUCED INTO THIS COUNTRY SPASMODICALLY SOME THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO
4455-14896-0005 WHEN HE WAS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE BOARHOUND OR THE GERMAN MASTIFF
4455-14896-0006 IN THE FOREIGN CLASS AT DOG SHOWS BUT IT SOON GAINED IN PUBLIC FAVOUR AND IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES A GREAT DANE CLUB WAS FORMED AND THE BREED HAS SINCE BECOME ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR OF THE LARGER DOGS THE KENNEL CLUB HAS CLASSED THE GREAT DANE AMONGST THE NON SPORTING DOGS
4455-14896-0007 PROBABLY BECAUSE WITH US HE CANNOT FIND A QUARRY WORTHY OF HIS METTLE BUT FOR ALL THAT
4455-14896-0008 RESPECTING THE TEMPERAMENT OF THE GREAT DANE AND HIS SUITABILITY AS A COMPANION WRITERS HAVE GONE TO EXTREMES IN PRAISE AND CONDEMNATION IN HIS FAVOUR IT MUST BE SAID THAT IN NATURAL INTELLIGENCE HE IS SURPASSED BY VERY FEW OTHER DOGS
4455-14896-0009 IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO TEACH HIM IN THE HAPHAZARD WAY WHICH MIGHT BE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING A SMALL DOG UNDER CONTROL BUT EVEN AS A COMPANION HE OUGHT TO BE TRAINED SYSTEMATICALLY AND CONSIDERING HIS MARKED INTELLIGENCE THIS IS NOT DIFFICULT OF ACCOMPLISHMENT
4455-14896-0010 AND CONSIDERING THAT PUPPIES HAVE TO BUILD UP IN THAT TIME A VERY BIG SKELETON AND STRAIGHT LIMBS SPECIAL ATTENTION MUST BE GIVEN TO THE REARING OF THEM THE DAM WHELPS FREQUENTLY EIGHT PUPPIES AND SOMETIMES EVEN A FEW MORE
4455-14896-0011 NOT MORE THAN FOUR OR AT THE OUTSIDE FIVE SHOULD BE LEFT WITH THE BITCH THE OTHERS SHOULD BE PUT TO A FOSTER MOTHER OR IF THEY ARE WEAKLINGS OR FOUL MARKED IT IS BEST TO DESTROY THEM AFTER THE PUPPIES ARE WEANED THEIR FOOD SHOULD BE OF BONE MAKING QUALITY
4455-14896-0012 ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT POINT IS THE GRACEFUL CARRIAGE OF THE TAIL WHEN IT IS CURLED OVER THE BACK IT MAKES AN OTHERWISE HANDSOME DOG LOOK MEAN
4455-14896-0013 IN FORMER TIMES FAKING WAS NOT INFREQUENTLY RESORTED TO TO CORRECT A FAULTY TAIL CARRIAGE BUT IT IS EASILY DETECTED GREAT DANES SOMETIMES INJURE THE END OF THE TAIL BY HITTING IT AGAINST A HARD SUBSTANCE
4455-14896-0014 AND THOSE WITH A GOOD CARRIAGE OF TAIL ARE MOST LIABLE TO THIS BECAUSE IN EXCITEMENT THEY SLASH IT ABOUT WHEREAS THE FAULTY POSITION OF THE TAIL CURLED OVER THE BACK INSURES IMMUNITY FROM HARM
4455-14896-0015 THE ENGLISH CLUBS HOWEVER HAVE NOW IN THIS PARTICULAR ALSO ADOPTED THE GERMAN STANDARD THE ORTHODOX COLOURS ARE BRINDLE FAWN BLUE BLACK AND HARLEQUIN
4455-14896-0016 WHICH MUST BE OF IRREGULAR SHAPE BROKEN UP AS IF THEY HAD BEEN TORN AND NOT HAVE ROUNDED OUTLINES
4455-14896-0017 THE FOLLOWING IS THE OFFICIAL DESCRIPTION ISSUED BY THE GREAT DANE CLUB GENERAL APPEARANCE THE GREAT DANE IS NOT SO HEAVY OR MASSIVE AS THE MASTIFF NOR SHOULD HE TOO NEARLY APPROACH THE GREYHOUND TYPE
4455-14896-0018 REMARKABLE IN SIZE AND VERY MUSCULAR STRONGLY THOUGH ELEGANTLY BUILT THE HEAD AND NECK SHOULD BE CARRIED HIGH AND THE TAIL IN LINE WITH THE BACK OR SLIGHTLY UPWARDS BUT NOT CURLED OVER THE HIND QUARTERS
4455-14896-0019 BUT THERE MUST BE THAT ALERTNESS OF EXPRESSION AND BRISKNESS OF MOVEMENT WITHOUT WHICH THE DANE CHARACTER IS LOST HE SHOULD HAVE A LOOK OF DASH AND DARING OF BEING READY TO GO ANYWHERE AND DO ANYTHING TEMPERAMENT
4455-14896-0020 NOT DEMONSTRATIVE WITH STRANGERS INTELLIGENT COURAGEOUS AND ALWAYS ALERT HIS VALUE AS A GUARD IS UNRIVALLED HE IS EASILY CONTROLLED WHEN WELL TRAINED BUT HE MAY GROW SAVAGE IF CONFINED TOO MUCH KEPT ON CHAIN OR ILL TREATED HEIGHT
4455-14896-0021 HEAD TAKEN ALTOGETHER THE HEAD SHOULD GIVE THE IDEA OF GREAT LENGTH AND STRENGTH OF JAW THE MUZZLE OR FOREFACE IS BROAD AND THE SKULL PROPORTIONATELY NARROW
4455-14896-0022 WHEN VIEWED FROM ABOVE AND IN FRONT
4455-14896-0023 LENGTH OF HEAD THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF HEAD VARIES WITH THE HEIGHT OF THE DOG
4455-14896-0024 THE OCCIPITAL PEAK NOT PROMINENT THERE SHOULD BE A DECIDED RISE OR BROW OVER THE EYES BUT NO ABRUPT STOP BETWEEN THEM FACE THE FACE SHOULD BE CHISELLED WELL AND FOREFACE LONG OF EQUAL DEPTH THROUGHOUT

4455-14896-0027 NOSE AND NOSTRILS THE BRIDGE OF THE NOSE SHOULD BE VERY WIDE WITH A SLIGHT RIDGE WHERE THE CARTILAGE JOINS THE BONE
4455-14896-0028 THE NOSTRILS SHOULD BE LARGE WIDE AND OPEN GIVING A BLUNT LOOK TO THE NOSE A BUTTERFLY OR FLESH COLOURED NOSE IS NOT OBJECTED TO IN HARLEQUINS EARS THE EARS SHOULD BE SMALL SET HIGH ON THE SKULL
4455-14896-0029 AND CARRIED SLIGHTLY ERECT WITH THE TIPS FALLING FORWARD NECK
4455-14896-0030 HELD WELL UP SNAKELIKE IN CARRIAGE
4455-14896-0031 SHOULDERS THE SHOULDERS SHOULD BE MUSCULAR BUT NOT LOADED AND WELL SLOPED BACK WITH THE ELBOWS WELL UNDER THE BODY SO THAT WHEN VIEWED IN FRONT THE DOG DOES NOT STAND TOO WIDE FORE LEGS AND FEET
