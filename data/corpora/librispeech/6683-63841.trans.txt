6683-63841-0000 WILLIAM B ASTOR HOUSE OWNER IN ESTIMATING THE CHARACTER AND MERITS OF SUCH A MAN AS THE LATE MISTER ASTOR WE ARE APT TO LEAVE OUT OF VIEW THE ENORMOUS HARM HE MIGHT HAVE DONE
6683-63841-0001 IF HE HAD CHOSEN TO DO IT THE RICH FOOL WHO TOSSES A DOLLAR TO A WAITER FOR SOME TRIFLING SERVICE DEBASES THE WAITER INJURES HIMSELF AND WRONGS THE PUBLIC
6683-63841-0002 BY ACTING IN THAT MANNER IN ALL THE TRANSACTIONS OF LIFE A RICH MAN DIFFUSES AROUND HIM AN ATMOSPHERE OF CORRUPTION AND RAISES THE SCALE OF EXPENSE TO A POINT WHICH IS OPPRESSIVE TO MANY
6683-63841-0003 RUINOUS TO SOME AND INCONVENIENT TO ALL THE LATE MISTER ASTOR WITH AN INCOME FROM INVESTED PROPERTY OF NEARLY TWO MILLIONS A YEAR COULD HAVE MADE LIFE MORE DIFFICULT
6683-63841-0004 AND HE MADE HIS PURCHASES WITH PRUDENCE AND FORETHOUGHT AS HE LIVED FOR MANY YEARS NEXT DOOR TO THE ASTOR LIBRARY THE FREQUENTERS OF THAT NOBLE INSTITUTION HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVING
6683-63841-0005 THAT HE LAID IN HIS YEAR'S SUPPLY OF COAL IN THE MONTH OF JUNE WHEN COAL IS CHEAPEST THERE WAS NOTHING WHICH HE SO MUCH ABHORRED AS WASTE
6683-63841-0006 BUT BECAUSE HE JUSTLY REGARDED WASTE AS WICKED HIS EXAMPLE IN THIS PARTICULAR IN A CITY SO GIVEN TO CARELESS AND OSTENTATIOUS PROFUSION AS NEW YORK WAS MOST USEFUL
6683-63841-0007 THERE IS NOTHING SO SHOCKING TO A REPUBLICANIZED MIND AS THE AWFUL CONTRAST BETWEEN THE ABODES OF THE POOR AND THE ESTABLISHMENTS OF THE RICH A MAGNIFICENT PARK OF A THOUSAND ACRES OF THE RICHEST LAND
6683-63841-0008 SET APART AND WALLED IN FOR THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF ONE FAMILY WHILE ALL ABOUT IT ARE THE SQUALID HOVELS OF THE PEASANTS TO WHOM THE USE OF A SINGLE ACRE TO A FAMILY WOULD BE EASE AND COMFORT
6683-63841-0009 IS THE MOST PAINFUL AND SHAMEFUL SPECTACLE UPON WHICH THE SUN LOOKS DOWN THIS DAY NOTHING CAN MAKE IT RIGHT IT IS MONSTROUS IT CURSES EQUALLY THE FEW WHO RIDE IN THE PARK
6683-63841-0010 AND THE MANY WHO LOOK OVER ITS WALLS FOR THE GREAT LORD WHO CAN SUBMIT TO BE THE AGENT OF SUCH INJUSTICE IS AS MUCH ITS VICTIM AS THE DEGRADED LABORER WHO DROWNS THE SENSE OF HIS MISERY IN POT HOUSE BEER
6683-63841-0011 THE MERE FACT THAT THE LORD CAN LOOK UPON SUCH A SCENE AND NOT STIR TO MEND IT IS PROOF POSITIVE OF A PROFOUND VULGARITY
6683-63841-0012 NOR IS IT LORDS ALONE WHO THUS WASTE THE HARD EARNED WEALTH OF THE TOILING SONS OF MEN I READ SOME TIME AGO OF A WEDDING IN PARIS A THRIVING BANKER THERE
6683-63841-0013 WHO IS STYLED THE BARON ALPHONSE DE ROTHSCHILD HAVING A DAUGHTER OF SEVENTEEN TO MARRY APPEARS TO HAVE SET SERIOUSLY TO WORK TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH MONEY A WEDDING COULD BE MADE TO COST
6683-63841-0014 IN PURSUING THIS INQUIRY
6683-63841-0015 AND DOWERED A NUMBER OF PORTIONLESS GIRLS EXPENDING IN THESE WAYS A QUARTER OF A MILLION FRANCS HE GAVE HIS DAUGHTER A PORTION OF FIVE MILLIONS OF FRANCS
6683-63841-0016 WOULD NOT HAVE CONVENIENTLY HELD THEM FOR THE CONVEYANCE OF THE WEDDING PARTY FROM THE HOUSE TO THE SYNAGOGUE HE CAUSED TWENTY FIVE MAGNIFICENT CARRIAGES TO BE MADE SUCH AS MONARCHS USE WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO BE CROWNED
6683-63841-0017 AND THESE VEHICLES WERE DRAWN BY HORSES IMPORTED FROM ENGLAND FOR THE PURPOSE THE BRIDAL VEIL WAS COMPOSED OF INEFFABLE LACE MADE FROM AN ORIGINAL DESIGN EXPRESSLY FOR THIS BRIDE
6683-63841-0018 WHO SANG THE PRAYER FROM MOSES IN EGYPT A CROWD OF RABBIS AND ASSISTANT RABBIS WITH THE GRAND RABBI OF PARIS AT THEIR HEAD TO COMPLETE THE HISTRIONIC PERFORMANCE EIGHT YOUNG GIRLS
6683-63841-0019 HAVE THROWN HIS MILLIONS ABOUT IN THIS STYLE HE WAS ONE OF A SCORE OR TWO OF MEN IN NORTH AMERICA WHO COULD HAVE MAINTAINED ESTABLISHMENTS IN TOWN AND COUNTRY ON THE DASTARDLY SCALE SO COMMON AMONG RICH PEOPLE IN EUROPE
6683-63841-0020 HE TOO COULD HAVE HAD HIS PARK HIS HALF A DOZEN MANSIONS HIS THIRTY CARRIAGES HIS HUNDRED HORSES AND HIS YACHT AS BIG AS A MAN OF WAR THAT HE WAS ABOVE SUCH ATROCIOUS VULGARITY AS THIS
6683-63841-0021 SOME DISCREDIT ALSO WOULD HAVE BEEN CAST UPON THOSE WHO LIVE IN MODERATE AND MODEST WAYS EVERY QUARTER DAY MISTER ASTOR HAD NEARLY HALF A MILLION DOLLARS TO INVEST IN THE INDUSTRIES OF THE COUNTRY
6683-63841-0022 TO INVEST HIS SURPLUS INCOME IN THE BEST AND SAFEST MANNER WAS THE STUDY OF HIS LIFE HIS BUSINESS WAS TO TAKE CARE OF AND INCREASE HIS ESTATE AND THAT BEING HIS BUSINESS
6683-63841-0023 HE WAS RIGHT IN GIVING THE NECESSARY ATTENTION TO IT WILLIAM WILL NEVER MAKE MONEY HIS FATHER USED TO SAY BUT HE WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF WHAT HE HAS AND SO IT PROVED THE CONSEQUENCE WAS
6683-63841-0024 THAT ALL HIS LIFE HE INVESTED MONEY IN THE WAY THAT WAS AT ONCE BEST FOR HIMSELF AND BEST FOR THE COUNTRY NO USELESS OR PREMATURE SCHEME HAD HAD ANY ENCOURAGEMENT FROM HIM
6683-63841-0025 HE INVARIABLY AND BY A CERTAINTY OF JUDGMENT THAT RESEMBLED AN INSTINCT PUT HIS MONEY WHERE IT WOULD DO MOST GOOD POLITICAL ECONOMISTS DEMONSTRATE
6683-63841-0026 WHICH IS THE BEST FOR THE INVESTOR MUST OF NECESSITY BE THE BEST FOR THE PUBLIC HERE AGAIN WE WERE LUCKY WHEN WE WANTED HOUSES MORE THAN WE WANTED COAL HE BUILT HOUSES FOR US
6683-63841-0027 AND WHEN WE WANTED COAL MORE THAN WE WANTED HOUSES HE SET HIS MONEY TO DIGGING COAL CHARGING NOTHING FOR HIS TROUBLE BUT THE MERE COST OF HIS SUBSISTENCE ONE FAULT HE HAD AS A PUBLIC SERVANT
6683-63841-0028 FOR WE MAY FAIRLY REGARD IN THAT LIGHT A MAN WHO WIELDS SO LARGE A PORTION OF OUR COMMON ESTATE HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST TIMID OF MEN HE WAS EVEN TIMOROUS
6683-63841-0029 NOR CAN IT BE SAID THAT HE WAS MORALLY BRAVE YEAR AFTER YEAR HE SAW A GANG OF THIEVES IN THE CITY HALL STEALING HIS REVENUES UNDER THE NAME OF TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS BUT HE NEVER LED AN ASSAULT UPON THEM
6683-63841-0030 NOR GAVE THE AID HE OUGHT TO THOSE WHO DID UNLESS HE IS GROSSLY BELIED HE PREFERRED TO COMPROMISE THAN FIGHT AND DID NOT ALWAYS DISDAIN TO COURT THE RUFFIANS WHO PLUNDERED HIM
6683-63841-0031 THIS WAS A GRAVE FAULT HE WHO HAD THE MOST IMMEDIATE AND THE MOST OBVIOUS INTEREST IN EXPOSING AND RESISTING THE SCOUNDRELS OUGHT TO HAVE TAKEN THE LEAD IN PUTTING THEM DOWN THIS HE COULD NOT DO
6683-63841-0032 NATURE HAD DENIED HIM THE QUALITIES REQUIRED FOR SUCH A CONTEST HE HAD HIS ENORMOUS ESTATE AND HE HAD MIND ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF IT IN ORDINARY WAYS BUT HE HAD NOTHING MORE
