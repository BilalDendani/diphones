348-132611-0004 AND WAS EAGER TO RETRIEVE HIS FALLEN FORTUNES BY MEANS OF LUCRATIVE POSTS
348-132611-0005 AND WHO HAD BEEN REWARDED FOR HIS SERVICES WITH THE TITLE
348-132611-0006 THIS RECKLESS FACTION WAS STRENGTHENED BY AN IMPORTANT REINFORCEMENT RICHARD TALBOT EARL OF TYRCONNEL THE FIERCEST AND MOST UNCOMPROMISING OF ALL THOSE WHO HATED THE LIBERTIES AND RELIGION OF ENGLAND ARRIVED AT COURT FROM DUBLIN

348-132611-0012 BY LAYING THE BLAME OF THE ACCIDENT ON HER MONKEY THESE STORIES WHICH IF THEY HAD BEEN TRUE WOULD NEVER HAVE PASSED THE LIPS OF ANY BUT THE BASEST OF MANKIND WERE PURE INVENTIONS TALBOT WAS SOON FORCED TO OWN THAT THEY WERE SO
348-132611-0013 AND HE OWNED IT WITHOUT A BLUSH THE INJURED LADY BECAME DUCHESS OF YORK HAD HER HUSBAND BEEN A MAN REALLY UPRIGHT AND HONOURABLE HE WOULD HAVE DRIVEN FROM HIS PRESENCE WITH INDIGNATION AND CONTEMPT THE WRETCHES WHO HAD SLANDERED HER
348-132611-0014 BUT ONE OF THE PECULIARITIES OF JAMES'S CHARACTER WAS THAT NO ACT HOWEVER WICKED AND SHAMEFUL WHICH HAD BEEN PROMPTED BY A DESIRE TO GAIN HIS FAVOUR EVER SEEMED TO HIM DESERVING OF DISAPPROBATION
348-132611-0015 TALBOT CONTINUED TO FREQUENT THE COURT APPEARED DAILY WITH BRAZEN FRONT BEFORE THE PRINCESS WHOSE RUIN HE HAD PLOTTED AND WAS INSTALLED INTO THE LUCRATIVE POST OF CHIEF PANDAR TO HER HUSBAND IN NO LONG TIME

348-132611-0017 NOT TO COUNTENANCE THIS BAD MAN WHO HAD NOTHING TO RECOMMEND HIM EXCEPT HIS FINE PERSON AND HIS TASTE IN DRESS TALBOT WAS NOT ONLY WELCOME AT THE PALACE WHEN THE BOTTLE OR THE DICEBOX WAS GOING ROUND
348-132611-0018 BUT WAS HEARD WITH ATTENTION ON MATTERS OF BUSINESS HE AFFECTED THE CHARACTER OF AN IRISH PATRIOT AND PLEADED WITH GREAT AUDACITY AND SOMETIMES WITH SUCCESS THE CAUSE OF HIS COUNTRYMEN WHOSE ESTATES HAD BEEN CONFISCATED HE TOOK CARE HOWEVER

348-132611-0020 IMPROVIDENCE AND ECCENTRIC IMPUDENCE HE WAS IN TRUTH ONE OF THE MOST MERCENARY AND CRAFTY OF MANKIND HE WAS NOW NO LONGER YOUNG AND WAS EXPIATING BY SEVERE SUFFERINGS THE DISSOLUTENESS OF HIS YOUTH
348-132611-0021 BUT AGE AND DISEASE HAD MADE NO ESSENTIAL CHANGE IN HIS CHARACTER AND MANNERS HE STILL WHENEVER HE OPENED HIS MOUTH
348-132611-0022 SET HIM DOWN FOR THE WILDEST OF LIBERTINES THE MULTITUDE WAS UNABLE TO CONCEIVE THAT A MAN WHO EVEN WHEN SOBER WAS MORE FURIOUS AND BOASTFUL THAN OTHERS WHEN THEY WERE DRUNK
348-132611-0023 COULD REALLY BE A COLDHEARTED FARSIGHTED SCHEMING SYCOPHANT YET SUCH A MAN WAS TALBOT IN TRUTH HIS HYPOCRISY WAS OF A FAR HIGHER AND RARER SORT
348-132611-0024 FOR THE CONSUMMATE HYPOCRITE IS NOT HE WHO CONCEALS VICE BEHIND THE SEMBLANCE OF VIRTUE BUT HE WHO MAKES THE VICE WHICH HE HAS NO OBJECTION TO SHOW A STALKING HORSE TO COVER DARKER AND MORE PROFITABLE VICE
348-132611-0025 WHICH IT IS FOR HIS INTEREST TO HIDE TALBOT RAISED BY JAMES TO THE EARLDOM OF TYRCONNEL HAD COMMANDED THE TROOPS IN IRELAND DURING THE NINE MONTHS
348-132611-0026 WHICH ELAPSED BETWEEN THE DEATH OF CHARLES AND THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE VICEROYALTY OF CLARENDON WHEN THE NEW LORD LIEUTENANT WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE LONDON FOR DUBLIN THE GENERAL WAS SUMMONED FROM DUBLIN TO LONDON DICK TALBOT
348-132611-0027 HAD LONG BEEN WELL KNOWN ON THE ROAD WHICH HE HAD NOW TO TRAVEL BETWEEN CHESTER AND THE CAPITAL THERE WAS NOT AN INN WHERE HE HAD NOT BEEN IN A BRAWL WHEREVER HE CAME HE PRESSED HORSES IN DEFIANCE OF LAW
348-132611-0028 SWORE AT THE COOKS AND POSTILIONS AND ALMOST RAISED MOBS BY HIS INSOLENT RODOMONTADES THE REFORMATION HE TOLD THE PEOPLE HAD RUINED EVERYTHING BUT FINE TIMES WERE COMING
348-132611-0029 THE CATHOLICS WOULD SOON BE UPPERMOST THE HERETICS SHOULD PAY FOR ALL RAVING AND BLASPHEMING INCESSANTLY LIKE A DEMONIAC
348-132611-0030 HE ALLIED HIMSELF CLOSELY WITH CASTELMAINE DOVER AND ALBEVILLE THESE MEN CALLED WITH ONE VOICE FOR WAR ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH AND THE STATE
348-132611-0031 THAT HE OWED IT TO HIS RELIGION AND TO THE DIGNITY OF HIS CROWN TO STAND FIRM AGAINST THE OUTCRY OF HERETICAL DEMAGOGUES AND TO LET THE PARLIAMENT SEE FROM THE FIRST THAT HE WOULD BE MASTER IN SPITE OF OPPOSITION
348-132611-0032 AND THAT THE ONLY EFFECT OF OPPOSITION WOULD BE TO MAKE HIM A HARD MASTER EACH OF THE TWO PARTIES INTO WHICH THE COURT WAS DIVIDED HAD ZEALOUS FOREIGN ALLIES THE MINISTERS OF SPAIN OF THE EMPIRE AND OF THE STATES GENERAL
348-132611-0033 WERE NOW AS ANXIOUS TO SUPPORT ROCHESTER AS THEY HAD FORMERLY BEEN TO SUPPORT HALIFAX ALL THE INFLUENCE OF BARILLON WAS EMPLOYED ON THE OTHER SIDE AND BARILLON WAS ASSISTED BY ANOTHER FRENCH AGENT
348-132611-0034 INFERIOR TO HIM IN STATION BUT FAR SUPERIOR IN ABILITIES BONREPAUX BARILLON WAS NOT WITHOUT PARTS AND POSSESSED IN LARGE MEASURE THE GRACES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHICH THEN DISTINGUISHED THE FRENCH GENTRY
348-132611-0035 BUT HIS CAPACITY WAS SCARCELY EQUAL TO WHAT HIS GREAT PLACE REQUIRED HE HAD BECOME SLUGGISH AND SELF INDULGENT LIKED THE PLEASURES OF SOCIETY AND OF THE TABLE BETTER THAN BUSINESS AND ON GREAT EMERGENCIES
348-132611-0036 AND EVEN FOR REPRIMANDS FROM VERSAILLES
348-132611-0037 BY THE INTELLIGENCE AND INDUSTRY WHICH HE HAD EXHIBITED AS A CLERK IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE MARINE AND WAS ESTEEMED AN ADEPT IN THE MYSTERY OF MERCANTILE POLITICS AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE
348-132611-0038 HE WAS SENT TO LONDON CHARGED WITH SEVERAL SPECIAL COMMISSIONS OF HIGH IMPORTANCE HE WAS TO LAY THE GROUND FOR A TREATY OF COMMERCE HE WAS TO ASCERTAIN AND REPORT THE STATE OF THE ENGLISH FLEETS
348-132611-0039 AND DOCKYARDS AND HE WAS TO MAKE SOME OVERTURES TO THE HUGUENOT REFUGEES WHO IT WAS SUPPOSED
348-132611-0040 THAT THEY WOULD THANKFULLY ACCEPT ALMOST ANY TERMS OF RECONCILIATION THE NEW ENVOY'S ORIGIN WAS PLEBEIAN HIS STATURE WAS DWARFISH HIS COUNTENANCE WAS LUDICROUSLY UGLY
348-132611-0041 AND HIS ACCENT WAS THAT OF HIS NATIVE GASCONY BUT HIS STRONG SENSE HIS KEEN PENETRATION AND HIS LIVELY WIT EMINENTLY QUALIFIED HIM FOR HIS POST
348-132611-0042 IN SPITE OF EVERY DISADVANTAGE OF BIRTH AND FIGURE HE WAS SOON KNOWN AS A MOST PLEASING COMPANION AND AS A MOST SKILFUL DIPLOMATIST HE CONTRIVED WHILE FLIRTING WITH THE DUCHESS OF MAZARIN
348-132611-0043 DISCUSSING LITERARY QUESTIONS WITH WALLER AND SAINT EVREMOND AND CORRESPONDING WITH LA FONTAINE TO ACQUIRE A CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF ENGLISH POLITICS
348-132611-0044 HIS SKILL IN MARITIME AFFAIRS RECOMMENDED HIM TO JAMES WHO HAD DURING MANY YEARS PAID CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE BUSINESS OF THE ADMIRALTY AND UNDERSTOOD THAT BUSINESS AS WELL AS HE WAS CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING ANYTHING
348-132611-0045 THEY CONVERSED EVERY DAY LONG AND FREELY ABOUT THE STATE OF THE SHIPPING AND THE DOCK YARDS THE RESULT OF THIS INTIMACY WAS AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED THAT THE KEEN AND VIGILANT FRENCHMAN
348-132611-0046 CONCEIVED A GREAT CONTEMPT FOR THE KING'S ABILITIES AND CHARACTER THE WORLD HE SAID HAD MUCH OVERRATED HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY WHO HAD LESS CAPACITY THAN CHARLES
348-132611-0047 THOUGH PURSUING ONE OBJECT VERY JUDICIOUSLY TOOK DIFFERENT PATHS THEY MADE A PARTITION OF THE COURT BONREPAUX LIVED CHIEFLY WITH ROCHESTER AND ROCHESTER'S ADHERENTS BARILLON'S CONNECTIONS
348-132611-0048 WERE CHIEFLY WITH THE OPPOSITE FACTION THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THEY SOMETIMES SAW THE SAME EVENT IN DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW
