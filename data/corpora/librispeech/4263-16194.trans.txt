4263-16194-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT MARY BALLARD'S DISCOVERY PETER JUNIOR'S MIND WAS QUITE MADE UP TO GO HIS OWN WAY AND LEAVE HOME TO STUDY ABROAD BUT FIRST HE WOULD TRY TO CONVERT HIS FATHER TO HIS WAY OF THINKING THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER THING TO BE DONE
4263-16194-0001 THAT UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS WOULD NEVER DO BUT TO MAKE SURE OF BETTY LEST SOME ONE COME AND STEAL INTO HER HEART BEFORE HIS RETURN AFTER HIS TALK WITH HIS FATHER IN THE BANK HE LAY LONG INTO THE NIGHT
4263-16194-0002 GAZING AT THE SHADOWED TRACERY ON HIS WALL CAST BY THE FULL HARVEST MOON SHINING THROUGH THE MAPLE BRANCHES OUTSIDE HIS WINDOW THE LEAVES HAD NOT ALL FALLEN AND IN THE LIGHT BREEZE THEY DANCED AND QUIVERED AND THE BRANCHES SWAYED
4263-16194-0003 AND THE SHADOWS ALSO SWAYED AND DANCED DELICATELY OVER THE SOFT GRAY WALL PAPER AND THE RED COATED OLD SOLDIER STANDING STIFFLY IN HIS GOLD FRAME
4263-16194-0004 AND OFTEN HE TRIED TO CALL THEM OUT FROM THE PAST TO BANISH THINGS HE WOULD FORGET LONG THIS NIGHT HE LAY PLANNING AND THINKING SHOULD HE SPEAK TO BETTY AND TELL HER HE LOVED HER SHOULD HE ONLY TEACH HER TO THINK OF HIM NOT WITH THE FRANK LIKING OF HER GIRLHOOD
4263-16194-0005 HE WOULD WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE NEXT DAY WOULD BRING FORTH IN THE MORNING HE DISCARDED HIS CRUTCH AS HE HAD THREATENED AND WALKED OUT TO THE STUDIO USING ONLY A STOUT OLD BLACKTHORN STICK HE HAD FOUND ONE DAY WHEN RUMMAGING AMONG A COLLECTION OF ODDS AND ENDS IN THE ATTIC
4263-16194-0006 HE THOUGHT THE STICK WAS HIS FATHER'S AND WONDERED WHY SO INTERESTING A WALKING STICK
4263-16194-0007 BUT IT HAD BEEN MANY YEARS SINCE THE ELDER HAD LAID EYES ON THAT KNOBBED AND STURDY STICK WHICH LARRY HAD TREASURED AS A RARE THING IN THE NEW WORLD
4263-16194-0008 IT HAD BELONGED TO HIS GREAT GRANDFATHER IN IRELAND AND NO DOUBT HAD DONE ITS PART IN CRACKING CROWNS BETTY KNEADING BREAD AT A TABLE BEFORE THE KITCHEN WINDOW SPIED PETER JUNIOR LIMPING WEARILY UP THE WALK WITHOUT HIS CRUTCH AND RAN TO HIM DUSTING THE FLOUR FROM HER HANDS AS SHE CAME
