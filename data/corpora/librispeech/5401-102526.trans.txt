5401-102526-0000 MANZIKERT TEN FIFTY SEVEN
5401-102526-0001 THE MOMENT THAT THE LAST OF THE MACEDONIAN DYNASTY WAS GONE THE ELEMENTS OF DISCORD SEEMED UNCHAINED AND THE DOUBLE SCOURGE OF CIVIL WAR AND FOREIGN INVASION BEGAN TO AFFLICT THE EMPIRE
5401-102526-0002 IN THE TWENTY FOUR YEARS BETWEEN TEN FIFTY SEVEN AND TEN EIGHTY ONE WERE PRESSED MORE DISASTERS THAN HAD BEEN SEEN IN ANY OTHER PERIOD OF EAST ROMAN HISTORY SAVE PERHAPS THE REIGN OF HERACLIUS
5401-102526-0003 FOR NOW CAME THE SECOND CUTTING SHORT OF THE EMPIRE THE BLOW THAT WAS DESTINED TO SHEAR AWAY HALF ITS STRENGTH
5401-102526-0004 DOMESTIC TROUBLES WERE THE FIRST INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE OF THE EXTINCTION OF THE MACEDONIAN DYNASTY THE AGED THEODORA HAD NAMED AS HER SUCCESSOR ON THE THRONE MICHAEL STRATIOTICUS
5401-102526-0005 AND THE EMPIRE WAS FULL OF AMBITIOUS GENERALS WHO WOULD NOT TOLERATE A DOTARD ON THE THRONE
5401-102526-0006 AND REPLACE HIM BY ISAAC COMNENUS THE CHIEF OF ONE OF THE ANCIENT CAPPADOCIAN HOUSES AND THE MOST POPULAR GENERAL OF THE EAST
5401-102526-0007 OVER THE EMPIRE THE MOST TERRIBLE MILITARY DANGER THAT HAD BEEN SEEN FOR FOUR CENTURIES THE SAFETY OF THE REALM WAS ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF ITS WELL PAID AND WELL DISCIPLINED NATIONAL ARMY
5401-102526-0008 AND ANYTHING THAT IMPAIRED THE EFFICIENCY OF THE ARMY WAS FRAUGHT WITH THE DEADLIEST PERIL THE SELJOUK TURKS WERE NOW DRAWING NEAR
5401-102526-0009 IN TEN FIFTY THEY HAD PENETRATED TO BAGDAD AND THEIR GREAT CHIEF TOGRUL BEG HAD DECLARED HIMSELF DEFENDER OF THE FAITH AND PROTECTOR OF THE CALIPH ARMENIA HAD NEXT BEEN OVERRUN
5401-102526-0010 AND THE BULWARK WHICH PROTECTED THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE FROM EASTERN INVASIONS THE REIGN OF CONSTANTINE DUCAS WAS TROUBLED BY COUNTLESS SELJOUK INVASIONS OF THE ARMENIAC ANATOLIC
5401-102526-0011 AND CAPPADOCIAN THEMES SOMETIMES THE INVADERS WERE DRIVEN BACK SOMETIMES THEY ELUDED THE IMPERIAL TROOPS AND ESCAPED WITH THEIR BOOTY BUT WHETHER SUCCESSFUL OR UNSUCCESSFUL THEY DISPLAYED A RECKLESS CRUELTY
5401-102526-0012 WHEREVER THEY PASSED THEY NOT MERELY PLUNDERED TO RIGHT AND LEFT BUT SLEW OFF THE WHOLE POPULATION
5401-102526-0013 WITH HIS REDUCED ARMY PROVED INCOMPETENT TO HOLD THEM BACK ALL THE MORE SO THAT HIS OPERATIONS WERE DISTRACTED BY AN INVASION OF THE UZES A TARTAR TRIBE FROM THE EUXINE SHORE WHO HAD BURST INTO BULGARIA
5401-102526-0014 TOOK A NEW HUSBAND AND MADE HIM GUARDIAN OF THE YOUNG MICHAEL THE NEW EMPEROR REGENT WAS ROMANUS
5401-102526-0015 AN ASIATIC NOBLE WHOSE BRILLIANT COURAGE DISPLAYED IN THE SELJOUK WARS HAD DAZZLED THE WORLD AND CAUSED IT TO FORGET THAT CAUTION AND ABILITY ARE FAR MORE REGAL VIRTUES THAN HEADLONG VALOUR
5401-102526-0016 IN THE ENDEAVOUR TO HUNT DOWN THE MARAUDING BANDS OF THE SELJOUKS THE OPERATIONS OF ROMANUS WERE NOT ENTIRELY UNSUCCESSFUL ALP ARSLAN THE SULTAN OF THE SELJOUKS CONTENTED HIMSELF AT FIRST WITH DISPERSING HIS HORDES IN SCATTERED BANDS
5401-102526-0017 AND ATTACKING MANY POINTS OF THE FRONTIER AT ONCE
5401-102526-0018 AND IN THE EVENING THE FIGHT WAS STILL UNDECIDED AS THE NIGHT WAS APPROACHING ROMANUS PREPARED TO DRAW HIS TROOPS BACK TO THE CAMP BUT AN UNHAPPY MISCONCEPTION OF ORDERS BROKE UP THE LINE
5401-102526-0019 AND THE SELJOUKS EDGED IN BETWEEN THE TWO HALVES OF THE ARMY EITHER FROM TREACHERY OR COWARDICE ANDRONICUS DUCAS THE OFFICER WHO COMMANDED THE RESERVE LED HIS MEN OFF WITHOUT FIGHTING
5401-102526-0020 THE EMPEROR'S DIVISION WAS BESET ON ALL SIDES BY THE ENEMY AND BROKE UP IN THE DUSK ROMANUS HIMSELF WAS WOUNDED THROWN FROM HIS HORSE
5401-102526-0021 THE EMPEROR WAS TREATED WITH KINDNESS AND ALLOWED AFTER SOME MONTHS TO RANSOM HIMSELF AND RETURN HOME HE WOULD HAVE FARED BETTER HOWEVER IF HE HAD REMAINED THE PRISONER OF THE TURK DURING HIS CAPTIVITY
5401-102526-0022 THE CONDUCT OF AFFAIRS HAD FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF JOHN DUCAS UNCLE OF THE YOUNG EMPEROR MICHAEL
5401-102526-0023 AND MOUNT THE THRONE AGAIN WHEN THE RELEASED CAPTIVE REAPPEARED JOHN HAD HIM SEIZED AND BLINDED
5401-102526-0024 EVERY GENERAL IN THE EMPIRE SEEMED TO THINK THAT THE TIME HAD COME FOR HIM TO ASSUME THE PURPLE BUSKINS AND PROCLAIM HIMSELF EMPEROR HISTORY RECORDS THE NAMES OF NO LESS THAN SIX PRETENDERS TO THE THRONE DURING THE NEXT NINE YEARS
5401-102526-0025 BESIDES SEVERAL REBELS WHO TOOK UP ARMS WITHOUT ASSUMING THE IMPERIAL TITLE THE YOUNG EMPEROR MICHAEL DUCAS PROVED WHEN HE CAME OF AGE TO BE A VICIOUS NONENTITY
5401-102526-0026 A FOURTH SHORT OF ITS PROPER CONTENTS HIS NAME AND THAT OF NICEPHORUS BOTANIATES THE REBEL WHO OVERTHREW HIM
5401-102526-0027 AND THE THEMES THAT WERE NOT OVERRUN BY THE TURKS WERE IN THE HANDS OF GOVERNORS WHO EACH DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN HIS OWN EYES
5401-102526-0028 AT LAST A MAN OF ABILITY WORKED HIMSELF UP TO THE SURFACE THIS WAS ALEXIUS COMNENUS NEPHEW OF THE EMPEROR ISAAC COMNENUS WHOSE SHORT REIGN WE RELATED IN THE OPENING PARAGRAPH OF THIS CHAPTER
5401-102526-0029 HE WAS THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED LIAR OF HIS AGE AND WHILE WINNING AND DEFENDING THE IMPERIAL THRONE COMMITTED ENOUGH ACTS OF MEAN TREACHERY AND SWORE ENOUGH FALSE OATHS TO STARTLE EVEN THE
5401-102526-0030 COURTIERS OF CONSTANTINOPLE HE COULD FIGHT WHEN NECESSARY BUT HE PREFERRED TO WIN BY TREASON AND PERJURY YET AS A RULER HE HAD MANY VIRTUES AND IT WILL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED TO HIS CREDIT
5401-102526-0031 THAT HE DRAGGED THE EMPIRE OUT OF THE DEEPEST SLOUGH OF DEGRADATION AND RUIN THAT IT HAD EVER SUNK INTO
5401-102526-0032 BORE WITNESS TO THE MILDNESS OF HIS RULE
