7128-84121-0000 HERE I'M BEING TRAILED MISTER BLAIR LOOKED UP FROM HIS WRITING TABLE WITH A STARTLED EXPRESSION AS JOHN DENE BURST INTO HIS ROOM
7128-84121-0001 IN ENTERING A ROOM JOHN DENE GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF FIRST ENDEAVOURING TO BREAK THROUGH THE PANELS AND APPEARING TO TURN THE HANDLE ONLY AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT TRAILED
7128-84121-0002 JOHN DENE STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT HIM ACCUSINGLY AS IF HE WERE RESPONSIBLE YES TRAILED WATCHED TRACKED SHADOWED FOLLOWED BUMPED INTO TRODDEN ON SNAPPED JOHN DENE IRRITABLY
7128-84121-0003 BEGAN MISTER BLAIR OH SHUCKS CRIED JOHN DENE AND STRIDING ACROSS TO THE DOOR HE PASSED INTO SIR LYSTER'S ROOM MORNING HE CRIED
7128-84121-0004 SOMEONE'S FOLLOWING ME AROUND AGAIN HE ANNOUNCED AND I WANT TO KNOW WHETHER IT'S YOU OR THEM ME OR WHO QUERIED SIR LYSTER WHETHER IT'S SOME OF YOUR BOYS OR THE OTHER LOT
7128-84121-0005 AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION SIR LYSTER SEEMED TO GRASP JOHN DENE'S MEANING I'LL MAKE ENQUIRY HE SAID SUAVELY
7128-84121-0006 IF WE WERE HAVING YOU SHADOWED MISTER DENE SAID SIR LYSTER QUIETLY AND IN ANY CASE IT WOULD BE FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY

7128-84121-0010 YOUR MAN CAN'T MISTAKE HIM LITTLE CHAP WITH RED HAIR ALL OVER HIM DON'T FORGET TO CALL OFF YOUR BOYS AND WITH THAT JOHN DENE WAS GONE TEN MINUTES LATER
7128-84121-0011 SIR BRIDGMAN NORTH FOUND THE FIRST LORD SITTING AT HIS TABLE APPARENTLY DEEP IN THOUGHT I CAN SEE JOHN DENE'S BEEN HERE LAUGHED SIR BRIDGMAN
7128-84121-0012 YOU AND BLAIR BOTH SHOW ALL THE OUTWARD VISIBLE SIGNS OF HAVING BEEN GINGERED UP SIR LYSTER SMILED FEEBLY HE FELT THAT SIR BRIDGMAN WAS WEARING THE JOKE A LITTLE THREADBARE
7128-84121-0013 HE'S BEEN HERE ABOUT ONE OF HIS MEN PICKING UP RYLES ON HIS WAY TO AUCHINLECH SAID SIR LYSTER A LITTLE MAN WITH RED HAIR ALL OVER HIM WAS HIS DESCRIPTION
7128-84121-0014 THEY'LL PROBABLY APPRECIATE HIM THERE IT'S RATHER DULL FOR EM I TAKE IT THAT MISTER DENE WILL FOLLOW IN A DAY OR TWO IT SIR LYSTER PAUSED THEN SEEING THAT HE WAS EXPECTED TO FINISH HIS SENTENCE HE ADDED
7128-84121-0015 IT WILL REALLY BE SOMETHING OF A RELIEF HE QUITE UPSET RICKARDS A FEW DAYS AGO OVER SOME REQUISITIONS I'VE NEVER KNOWN HIM SO ANNOYED PROFANE YOU MEAN LAUGHED SIR BRIDGMAN WHAT HAPPENED
7128-84121-0016 APPARENTLY HE OBJECTED TO BEING CALLED A DANCING LIZARD AND TOLD TO QUIT HIS FUNNY WORK SIR LYSTER SMILED AS IF FINDING CONSOLATION IN THE FACT THAT ANOTHER HAD SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF JOHN DENE
7128-84121-0017 IT'S NOTHING TO WHAT HE DID TO POOR OLD RAYNER LAUGHED SIR BRIDGMAN A DEAR OLD CHAP YOU KNOW BUT RATHER OF THE OLD BLUE WATER SCHOOL SIR LYSTER NODDED
7128-84121-0018 HE REMEMBERED THAT ADMIRAL RAYNER SEEMED TO TAKE A DELIGHT IN REMINDING HIM OF HIS CIVILIAN STATUS WITH SIR LYSTER HE WAS ALWAYS AS TECHNICAL IN HIS LANGUAGE AS A MIDSHIPMAN BACK FROM HIS FIRST CRUISE
7128-84121-0019 AND JOHN DENE TOLD HIM TO CUT IT OUT RAYNER PROTESTED THAT HE WAS THE BETTER JUDGE AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
7128-84121-0020 THAT NEXT TIME HE'D BETTER COME IN A DRESSING GOWN
7128-84121-0021 RAYNER HASN'T BEEN CIVIL TO ANYONE SINCE AND SIR BRIDGMAN LAUGHED LOUDLY I THINK MY SYMPATHIES ARE WITH RAYNER SMILED SIR LYSTER AS SIR BRIDGMAN MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR
7128-84121-0022 FRANKLY I DON'T LIKE JOHN DENE DON'T LIKE HIM WHY
7128-84121-0023 HE WILL PERSIST IN TREATING US AS EQUALS NOW I CALL THAT DAMNED NICE OF HIM AND SIR BRIDGMAN LEFT THE FIRST LORD GAZING AT THE PANELS OF THE DOOR THAT CLOSED BEHIND HIM
7128-84121-0024 WHILST SIR LYSTER AND SIR BRIDGMAN WERE DISCUSSING HIS UNCONVENTIONAL METHODS WITH ADMIRALS JOHN DENE HAD RETURNED TO HIS OFFICE AND WAS WORKING AT HIGH PRESSURE
7128-84121-0025 ROUNDED OFF AS JOHN DENE PHRASED IT DURING HIS ABSENCE DOROTHY WAS TO BE AT THE OFFICE EACH DAY UNTIL LUNCH TIME TO ATTEND TO ANY MATTERS THAT MIGHT CROP UP
7128-84121-0026 IF JOHN DENE REQUIRED ANYTHING IT WAS ARRANGED THAT HE WOULD WIRELESS FOR IT AND DOROTHY WAS TO SEE THAT HIS INSTRUCTIONS WERE CARRIED OUT TO THE LETTER THE QUALITY ABOUT JOHN DENE
7128-84121-0027 THAT HAD MOST IMPRESSED DOROTHY WAS HIS POWER OF CONCENTRATION HE WOULD BECOME SO ABSORBED IN HIS WORK THAT NOTHING ELSE SEEMED TO HAVE THE POWER OF PENETRATING TO HIS BRAIN
7128-84121-0028 A QUESTION ADDRESSED TO HIM THAT WAS UNRELATED TO WHAT WAS IN HAND HE WOULD IGNORE APPEARING NOT TO HAVE HEARD IT ON THE OTHER HAND A REMARK GERMANE TO THE TREND OF HIS THOUGHTS WOULD PRODUCE AN INSTANT REPLY
7128-84121-0029 IT APPEARED AS IF HIS MIND WERE SO ATTUNED AS TO THROW OFF ALL EXTRANEOUS MATTER HIS QUICKNESS OF DECISION AND AMAZING VITALITY DOROTHY FOUND BEWILDERING
7128-84121-0030 THEN MAKE UP YOUR MIND HE HAD SAID ON ONE OCCASION HE HAD NO USE FOR A MAN WHO WOULD WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW AFTERNOON
7128-84121-0031 I SLEEP ON A BED
7128-84121-0032 WAS ANOTHER OF HIS REMARKS THAT SHE REMEMBERED AND ONCE WHEN COMMENTING UPON THE CAUTIOUSNESS OF SIR LYSTER GRAYNE HE HAD SAID THE MAN WHO TAKES RISKS MAKES DOLLARS GRADUALLY
7128-84121-0033 DOROTHY HAD FALLEN UNDER THE SPELL OF JOHN DENE'S MASTERFUL PERSONALITY SHE FOUND HERSELF BECOMING CRITICAL OF OTHERS BY THE SIMPLE PROCESS OF COMPARING THEM WITH THE SELF CENTRED JOHN DENE
7128-84121-0034 SHE WOULD SMILE AT HIS ECCENTRICITIES HIS INTOLERANCE HIS SUPREME BELIEF IN HIMSELF AND HIS ALMOST FANATICAL DETERMINATION TO GINGER UP ANY
7128-84121-0035 AND HOW LITTLE THAT COUNTRY WAS UNDERSTOOD IN ENGLAND HOW BLIND BRITISH STATESMEN WERE TO THE FACT THAT THE EYES OF MANY CANADIANS WERE TURNED ANXIOUSLY TOWARDS THE GREAT REPUBLIC UPON THEIR BORDERS
7128-84121-0036 HOW IN THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE U S A THEY SAW A CONVINCING ARGUMENT IN FAVOUR OF A TIGHTENING OF THE BONDS THAT BOUND THE DOMINION TO THE OLD COUNTRY
7128-84121-0037 WHEN ON THE SUBJECT HE WOULD STRIDE RESTLESSLY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM SNAPPING OUT SHORT SHARP SENTENCES OF PROTEST AND CRITICISM HIS IMPERIALISM WAS THAT OF THE ENTHUSIAST
7128-84121-0038 TO HIM A CANADA LOST TO THE BRITISH EMPIRE MEANT A BRITISH EMPIRE LOST TO ITSELF HIS GREAT IDEA WAS TO SEE THE OLD COUNTRY CONTROL THE WORLD BY VIRTUE OF ITS POWER ITS BRAIN
7128-84121-0039 AND ITS JUSTICE HIS MEMORY WAS AMAZING IF DOROTHY FOUND HER NOTES OBSCURE AND TO COMPLETE A SENTENCE HAPPENED TO INSERT A WORD THAT WAS NOT THE ONE HE HAD DICTATED
7128-84121-0040 JOHN DENE WOULD NOTE IT AS HE READ THE LETTER WITH A LITTLE GRUNT SOMETIMES OF APPROVAL SOMETIMES OF DOUBT OR CORRECTION THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SHE FELT
7128-84121-0041 AS SHE EXPRESSED IT TO HER MOTHER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN DINING OFF BEEF ESSENCE AND OXYGEN
7128-84121-0042 HE WAS A SMALL EATER SEEMING TO REGARD MEALS AS A WASTE OF TIME AND HE SELDOM DRANK ANYTHING BUT WATER AT THE END OF THE DAY DOROTHY WOULD FEEL MORE TIRED THAN SHE HAD EVER FELT BEFORE
7128-84121-0043 BUT SHE HAD CAUGHT SOMETHING OF JOHN DENE'S ENTHUSIASM WHICH SEEMED TO CARRY HER ALONG AND DEFY THE FATIGUES OF THE BODY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SATURDAY AFTERNOONS AND THE WHOLE DAY'S REST ON SUNDAY
7128-84121-0044 SHE FELT THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE IN HIS INTOLERANCE JOHN DENE WAS SOMETIMES AMUSING SOMETIMES MONOTONOUS BUT ALWAYS UNCOMPROMISING
7128-84121-0045 ONE DAY DOROTHY VENTURED A WORD OF EXPOSTULATION HE HAD JUST BEEN EXPRESSING HIS UNMEASURED CONTEMPT FOR MISTER BLAIR YOU MUSTN'T JUDGE THE WHOLE BRITISH NAVY BY MISTER BLAIR SHE SAID
7128-84121-0046 LOOKING UP FROM HER NOTE BOOK WITH A SMILE ONE FOOL MAKES MANY HE HAD SNAPPED DECISIVELY
