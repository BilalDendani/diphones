572-126495-0000 BUT THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED BY THE DEMONSTRATION WAS LOST AS SOON AS IT WAS REPORTED FROM THE FRONT THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY HAD ADVANCED TO ATTACK THE ENEMY ON THE VERY DAY THAT THE WORKINGMEN AND THE PETROGRAD GARRISON DEMANDED THE PUBLICATION OF THE SECRET TREATIES
572-126495-0001 AND AN OPEN OFFER OF PEACE KERENSKY FLUNG THE REVOLUTIONARY TROOPS INTO BATTLE THIS WAS NO MERE COINCIDENCE TO BE SURE THE PROJECTORS HAD EVERYTHING PREPARED IN ADVANCE AND THE TIME OF ATTACK WAS DETERMINED NOT BY MILITARY
572-126495-0002 BUT BY POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS ON THE NINETEENTH OF JUNE THERE WAS A SO CALLED PATRIOTIC DEMONSTRATION IN THE STREETS OF PETROGRAD THE NEVSKY PROSPECT
572-126495-0003 WAS STUDDED WITH EXCITED GROUPS IN WHICH ARMY OFFICERS JOURNALISTS AND WELL DRESSED LADIES WERE CARRYING ON A BITTER CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE BOLSHEVIKI THE FIRST REPORTS OF THE MILITARY DRIVE WERE FAVORABLE THE LEADING LIBERAL PAPERS
572-126495-0004 CONSIDERED THAT THE PRINCIPAL AIM HAD BEEN ATTAINED
572-126495-0005 REGARDLESS OF ITS ULTIMATE MILITARY RESULTS WOULD DEAL A MORTAL BLOW TO THE REVOLUTION RESTORE THE ARMY'S FORMER DISCIPLINE AND ASSURE THE LIBERAL BOURGEOISIE OF A COMMANDING POSITION IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT WE HOWEVER
572-126495-0006 INDICATED TO THE BOURGEOISIE A DIFFERENT LINE OF FUTURE EVENTS
572-126495-0007 A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE DRIVE WE DECLARED THAT THE MILITARY ADVANCE WOULD INEVITABLY DESTROY ALL THE INTERNAL TIES WITHIN THE ARMY SET UP ITS VARIOUS PARTS ONE AGAINST THE OTHER AND TURN THE SCALES HEAVILY IN FAVOR OF THE COUNTER REVOLUTIONARY ELEMENTS
572-126495-0008 SINCE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE IN A DEMORALIZED ARMY AN ARMY DEVOID OF CONTROLLING IDEAS WITHOUT RECOURSE TO SEVERE REPRESSIVE MEASURES IN OTHER WORDS WE FORETOLD IN THIS DECLARATION
572-126495-0009 THOSE RESULTS WHICH LATER CAME TO BE KNOWN COLLECTIVELY UNDER THE NAME OF KORNILOVISM WE BELIEVED THAT THE GREATEST DANGER THREATENED THE REVOLUTION IN EITHER CASE WHETHER THE DRIVE PROVED SUCCESSFUL WHICH WE DID NOT EXPECT OR MET WITH FAILURE
572-126495-0010 WHICH SEEMED TO US ALMOST INEVITABLE A SUCCESSFUL MILITARY ADVANCE WOULD HAVE UNITED THE MIDDLE CLASS AND THE BOURGEOISIE IN THEIR COMMON CHAUVINISTIC TENDENCIES THUS ISOLATING THE REVOLUTIONARY PROLETARIAT
572-126495-0011 AN UNSUCCESSFUL DRIVE WAS LIKELY TO DEMORALIZE THE ARMY COMPLETELY TO INVOLVE A GENERAL RETREAT AND THE LOSS OF MUCH ADDITIONAL TERRITORY AND TO BRING DISGUST AND DISAPPOINTMENT TO THE PEOPLE EVENTS TOOK THE LATTER COURSE
572-126495-0012 THE NEWS OF VICTORY DID NOT LAST LONG IT WAS SOON REPLACED BY GLOOMY REPORTS OF THE REFUSAL OF MANY REGIMENTS TO SUPPORT THE ADVANCING COLUMNS OF THE GREAT LOSSES IN COMMANDING OFFICERS WHO SOMETIMES COMPOSED THE WHOLE OF THE ATTACKING UNITS ET CETERA
572-126495-0013 IN VIEW OF ITS GREAT HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE WE APPEND AN EXTRACT FROM THE DOCUMENT ISSUED BY OUR PARTY IN THE ALL RUSSIAN COUNCIL OF SOVIETS ON THE THIRD OF JUNE NINETEEN SEVENTEEN JUST TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE DRIVE
572-126495-0014 WE DEEM IT NECESSARY TO PRESENT AS THE FIRST ORDER OF THE DAY A QUESTION ON WHOSE SOLUTION DEPEND NOT ONLY ALL THE OTHER MEASURES TO BE ADOPTED BY THE COUNCIL BUT ACTUALLY AND LITERALLY THE FATE OF THE WHOLE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION
572-126495-0015 THE QUESTION OF THE MILITARY DRIVE WHICH IS BEING PLANNED FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE HAVING PUT THE PEOPLE AND THE ARMY WHICH DOES NOT KNOW IN THE NAME OF WHAT INTERNATIONAL ENDS IT IS CALLED UPON TO SHED ITS BLOOD FACE TO FACE WITH THE IMPENDING ATTACK
572-126495-0016 WITH ALL ITS CONSEQUENCES THE COUNTER REVOLUTIONARY CIRCLES OF RUSSIA ARE COUNTING ON THE FACT THAT THIS DRIVE WILL NECESSITATE A CONCENTRATION OF POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE MILITARY DIPLOMATIC AND CAPITALISTIC GROUPS
572-126495-0017 AFFILIATED WITH ENGLISH FRENCH AND AMERICAN IMPERIALISM AND THUS FREE THEM FROM THE NECESSITY OF RECKONING LATER WITH THE ORGANIZED WILL OF RUSSIAN DEMOCRACY THE SECRET COUNTER REVOLUTIONARY INSTIGATORS OF THE DRIVE
572-126495-0018 ARE CONSCIOUSLY TRYING TO PLAY ON THE DEMORALIZATION IN THE ARMY BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE INTERNAL AND INTERNATIONAL SITUATION OF THE COUNTRY AND TO THIS END ARE INSPIRING THE DISCOURAGED ELEMENTS WITH THE FALLACIOUS IDEA THAT THE VERY FACT OF A DRIVE CAN REHABILITATE THE ARMY
572-126495-0019 AND BY THIS MECHANICAL MEANS HIDE THE LACK OF A DEFINITE PROGRAM FOR LIQUIDATING THE WAR AT THE SAME TIME IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH AN ADVANCE CANNOT BUT COMPLETELY DISORGANIZE THE ARMY BY SETTING UP ITS VARIOUS UNITS ONE AGAINST THE OTHER
572-126495-0020 THE MILITARY EVENTS WERE DEVELOPING AMID EVER INCREASING DIFFICULTIES IN THE INTERNAL LIFE OF THE NATION WITH REGARD TO THE LAND QUESTION INDUSTRIAL LIFE AND NATIONAL RELATIONS THE COALITION GOVERNMENT DID NOT TAKE A SINGLE RESOLUTE STEP FORWARD
572-126495-0021 THE FOOD AND TRANSPORTATION SITUATIONS WERE BECOMING MORE AND MORE DISORGANIZED LOCAL CLASHES WERE GROWING MORE FREQUENT THE SOCIALISTIC MINISTERS WERE EXHORTING THE MASSES TO BE PATIENT ALL DECISIONS AND MEASURES
572-126495-0022 INCLUDING THE CALLING OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WERE BEING POSTPONED THE INSOLVENCY AND THE INSTABILITY OF THE COALITION REGIME WERE OBVIOUS THERE WERE TWO POSSIBLE WAYS OUT
572-126495-0023 TO DRIVE THE BOURGEOISIE OUT OF POWER AND PROMOTE THE AIMS OF THE REVOLUTION OR TO ADOPT THE POLICY OF BRIDLING THE PEOPLE BY RESORTING TO REPRESSIVE MEASURES
572-126495-0024 CLUNG TO A MIDDLE COURSE AND ONLY MUDDLED MATTERS THE MORE
572-126495-0025 UNDERSTOOD THAT THE UNSUCCESSFUL MILITARY ADVANCE OF JUNE EIGHTEENTH MIGHT DEAL A BLOW NOT ONLY TO THE REVOLUTION BUT ALSO TO THE GOVERNMENT TEMPORARILY THEY THREW THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF RESPONSIBILITY UPON THEIR ALLIES TO THE LEFT
572-126495-0026 ON THE SECOND OF JULY CAME A CRISIS IN THE MINISTRY THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF WHICH WAS THE UKRAINIAN QUESTION
572-126495-0027 FROM VARIOUS POINTS AT THE FRONT CAME DELEGATES AND PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS TELLING OF THE CHAOS WHICH REIGNED IN THE ARMY AS A RESULT OF THE ADVANCE THE SO CALLED GOVERNMENT PRESS DEMANDED SEVERE REPRESSIONS
572-126495-0028 SUCH DEMANDS FREQUENTLY CAME FROM THE SO CALLED SOCIALISTIC PAPERS ALSO KERENSKY MORE AND MORE OPENLY WENT OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE CADETS AND THE CADET GENERALS WHO HAD MANIFESTED NOT ONLY THEIR HATRED OF REVOLUTION
572-126495-0029 BUT ALSO THEIR BITTER ENMITY TOWARD REVOLUTIONARY PARTIES IN GENERAL THE ALLIED AMBASSADORS WERE PRESSING THE GOVERNMENT WITH THE DEMAND THAT ARMY DISCIPLINE BE RESTORED AND THE ADVANCE CONTINUED THE GREATEST PANIC PREVAILED IN GOVERNMENT CIRCLES
572-126495-0030 WHILE AMONG THE WORKINGMEN MUCH DISCONTENT HAD ACCUMULATED WHICH CRAVED FOR OUTWARD EXPRESSION AVAIL YOURSELVES OF THE RESIGNATIONS OF THE CADET MINISTERS
572-126495-0031 TO THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONISTS AND MENSHEVIKI IN CONTROL OF THE SOVIET PARTIES
572-126495-0032 THE SOVIET MINISTERS CAME TO REPORT A NEW CRISIS IN THE GOVERNMENT WE WERE INTENSELY INTERESTED TO LEARN WHAT POSITION THEY WOULD TAKE NOW THAT THEY HAD ACTUALLY GONE TO PIECES UNDER THE GREAT ORDEALS ARISING FROM COALITION POLICIES
572-126495-0033 THAT THOSE CONCESSIONS WHICH HE AND TERESHCHENKO HAD MADE TO THE KIEV RADA DID NOT BY ANY MEANS SIGNIFY A DISMEMBERMENT OF THE COUNTRY AND THAT THIS THEREFORE DID NOT GIVE THE CADETS ANY GOOD REASON FOR LEAVING THE MINISTRY
572-126495-0034 DOCTRINAIRISM OF FAILING TO UNDERSTAND THE NECESSITY FOR COMPROMISING WITH THE UKRAINIANS ET CETERA ET CETERA THE TOTAL IMPRESSION WAS PITIFUL IN THE EXTREME THE HOPELESS DOCTRINAIRE OF THE COALITION GOVERNMENT
572-126495-0035 WAS HURLING THE CHARGE OF DOCTRINAIRISM AGAINST THE CRAFTY CAPITALIST POLITICIANS WHO SEIZED UPON THE FIRST SUITABLE EXCUSE FOR COMPELLING THEIR POLITICAL CLERKS TO REPENT OF THE DECISIVE TURN THEY HAD GIVEN
572-126495-0036 AFTER ALL THE PRECEDING EXPERIENCE OF THE COALITION THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE BUT ONE WAY OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY TO BREAK WITH THE CADETS AND SET UP A SOVIET GOVERNMENT THE RELATIVE FORCES WITHIN THE SOVIETS
572-126495-0037 WERE SUCH AT THE TIME THAT THE SOVIET'S POWER AS A POLITICAL PARTY WOULD FALL NATURALLY INTO THE HANDS OF THE SOCIAL REVOLUTIONISTS AND THE MENSHEVIKI WE DELIBERATELY FACED THE SITUATION THANKS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF REELECTIONS AT ANY TIME
572-126495-0038 THE MECHANISM OF THE SOVIETS ASSURED A SUFFICIENTLY EXACT REFLECTION OF THE PROGRESSIVE SHIFT TOWARD THE LEFT IN THE MASSES OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS AFTER THE BREAK OF THE COALITION WITH THE BOURGEOISIE THE RADICAL TENDENCIES SHOULD WE EXPECTED
572-126495-0039 RECEIVE A GREATER FOLLOWING IN THE SOVIET ORGANIZATIONS UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE PROLETARIAT'S STRUGGLE FOR POWER WOULD NATURALLY MOVE IN THE CHANNEL OF SOVIET ORGANIZATIONS AND COULD TAKE A MORE NORMAL COURSE
572-126495-0040 HAVING BROKEN WITH THE BOURGEOISIE THE MIDDLE CLASS DEMOCRACY WOULD ITSELF FALL UNDER THEIR BAN AND WOULD BE COMPELLED TO SEEK A CLOSER UNION WITH THE SOCIALISTIC PROLETARIAT IN THIS WAY
572-126495-0041 OF THE MIDDLE CLASS DEMOCRATIC ELEMENTS WOULD BE OVERCOME SOONER OR LATER BY THE WORKING MASSES WITH THE HELP OF OUR CRITICISM THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE DEMANDED THAT THE LEADING SOVIET PARTIES IN WHICH WE HAD NO REAL CONFIDENCE
572-126495-0042 AND WE FRANKLY SAID SO SHOULD TAKE THE GOVERNING POWER INTO THEIR OWN HANDS BUT EVEN AFTER THE MINISTERIAL CRISIS OF THE SECOND OF JULY
572-126495-0043 AND HIS ADHERENTS DID NOT ABANDON THE COALITION IDEA THEY EXPLAINED IN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THAT THE LEADING CADETS WERE INDEED DEMORALIZED BY DOCTRINAIRISM AND EVEN BY COUNTER REVOLUTIONISM BUT THAT IN THE PROVINCES
572-126495-0044 THERE WERE STILL MANY BOURGEOIS ELEMENTS WHICH COULD STILL GO HAND IN HAND WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATS AND THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE OF THEIR CO OPERATION IT WAS NECESSARY TO ATTRACT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BOURGEOISIE INTO THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE NEW MINISTRY
572-126495-0045 DAN ALREADY ENTERTAINED HOPES OF A RADICAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO BE HASTILY BUILT UP AT THE TIME BY A FEW PRO DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS THE REPORT THAT THE COALITION GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN BROKEN UP
572-126495-0046 ONLY TO BE REPLACED BY A NEW COALITION SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH PETROGRAD AND PROVOKED A STORM OF INDIGNATION AMONG THE WORKINGMEN AND SOLDIERS EVERYWHERE
