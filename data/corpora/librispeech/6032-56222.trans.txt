6032-56222-0000 CONVERSATION MY DEAR DAUGHTER TO GIVE AND RECEIVE PLEASURE IN THOSE PLEASANT ASSEMBLAGES AND MEETINGS OF ACQUAINTANCES AND FRIENDS KNOWN BY THE GENERAL NAME OF SOCIETY
6032-56222-0001 IS ONE OF THE WORTHY MINOR AIMS OF LIFE IT IS ONE OF THE MARKS OF AN ADVANCING STATE OF INTELLIGENCE AND CULTURE WHEN AN ASSEMBLAGE OF GENTLEMEN AND LADIES CAN PASS DELIGHTFUL HOURS IN THE MERE INTERCHANGE OF THOUGHT IN CONVERSATION
6032-56222-0002 AND WHILE GAMES AND OTHER AMUSEMENTS MAY SERVE FOR A TEMPORARY VARIETY ALWAYS EXCEPTING GAMES KNOWN AS KISSING GAMES WHICH SHOULD BE PROMPTLY TABOOED AND DENOUNCED
6032-56222-0003 HOW SHALL A YOUNG GIRL FIT HERSELF TO ENJOY AND TO AFFORD ENJOYMENT IN GENERAL SOCIETY CERTAINLY THE FIRST REQUISITES ARE INTELLIGENCE
6032-56222-0004 A GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF STANDARD LITERATURE A GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT EVENTS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE IN THE WORLD AND SUCH A KNOWLEDGE OF THE BEST CURRENT LITERATURE
6032-56222-0005 AS MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE REGULAR READING OF ONE OR TWO OF THE STANDARD MONTHLY MAGAZINES AND HERE IT MAY HELP YOU IF I PARTICULARIZE A LITTLE IN REGARD TO A KNOWLEDGE OF IMPORTANT EVENTS OF THE DAY
6032-56222-0006 AND ALSO OF GENERAL AND CURRENT LITERATURE OF COURSE THE MAIN SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT EVENTS THAT ARE GOING ON IN THE WORLD IS THE DAILY OR WEEKLY NEWSPAPER AND YET
6032-56222-0007 THERE IS SCARCELY ANY READING SO UTTERLY DEMORALIZING TO GOOD MENTAL HABITS AS THE ORDINARY DAILY PAPER MORE THAN THREE FOURTHS OF THE MATTER PRINTED IN THE GREAT CITY DAILIES IS NOT ONLY OF NO USE TO ANYONE
6032-56222-0008 BUT IT IS A POSITIVE DAMAGE TO HABITS OF MENTAL APPLICATION TO READ IT IT IS A WASTE OF TIME EVEN TO UNDERTAKE TO SIFT THE IMPORTANT FROM THE UNIMPORTANT
6032-56222-0009 THE MOST THAT ANY EARNEST PERSON SHOULD ATTEMPT TO DO WITH A DAILY PAPER IS TO GLANCE OVER THE HEADLINES WHICH GIVE THE GIST OF THE NEWS AND THEN TO READ SUCH EDITORIAL COMMENTS
6032-56222-0010 YET SHOULD EVERY WEEK CAREFULLY READ A DIGEST OF NEWS PREPARED FOR A GOOD WEEKLY PAPER ONE WOULD BE THOROUGHLY FURNISHED WITH ALL NECESSARY KNOWLEDGE OF CONTEMPORANEOUS EVENTS AND THE TIME THUS SAVED FROM DAILY PAPERS
6032-56222-0011 COULD BE PROFITABLY EMPLOYED IN OTHER READING THE FIELD OF LITERATURE IS NOW SO VAST THAT NO ONE CAN HOPE TO BE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH MORE THAN A SMALL PORTION OF IT YET EVERY WELL INFORMED YOUNG PERSON
6032-56222-0012 EVEN THOUGH ONE SHOULD NEVER READ THEIR WORKS YOU MAY REMEMBER HOW IN THE RECENTLY FINISHED NOVEL OF THE RISE OF SILAS LAPHAM THE NOVELIST WITH A FEW SENTENCES
6032-56222-0013 SHOWS HOW RIDICULOUS A REALLY BEAUTIFUL AND AMIABLE GIRL WITH A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION MAY MAKE HERSELF IN CONVERSATION BY HER LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF STANDARD LITERATURE SHE WAS TELLING A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHERE THE BOOK SHELVES WERE TO BE
6032-56222-0014 IN THE SPLENDID NEW HOUSE BEING BUILT BY HER FATHER AND SUGGESTING THAT THE SHELVES WOULD LOOK NICE IF THE BOOKS HAD NICE BINDINGS OF COURSE I PRESUME SAID IRENE THOUGHTFULLY WE SHALL HAVE TO HAVE GIBBON
6032-56222-0015 IF YOU WANT TO READ HIM SAID COREY WITH A LAUGH OF SYMPATHY FOR AN IMAGINABLE JOKE WE HAD A GOOD DEAL ABOUT HIM IN SCHOOL I BELIEVE WE HAD ONE OF HIS BOOKS MINE'S LOST BUT PEN WILL REMEMBER
6032-56222-0016 THAT'S WHAT GIBBON WAS IS IT GIBBON OR GIBBONS THE YOUNG MAN DECIDED THE POINT WITH APPARENTLY SUPERFLUOUS DELICACY GIBBON I THINK THERE USED TO BE SO MANY OF THEM SAID IRENE GAILY
6032-56222-0017 I USED TO GET THEM MIXED UP WITH EACH OTHER AND I COULDN'T TELL THEM FROM THE POETS SHOULD YOU WANT TO HAVE POETRY YES I SUPPOSE SOME EDITION OF THE ENGLISH POETS WE DON'T ANY OF US LIKE POETRY
6032-56222-0018 COREY OWNED BUT OF COURSE THERE WAS A TIME WHEN TENNYSON WAS A GREAT DEAL MORE TO ME THAN HE IS NOW
6032-56222-0019 WELL NOT ALL FIVE OR SIX OF THE BEST YOU WANT LONGFELLOW AND BRYANT AND WHITTIER AND EMERSON AND LOWELL
6032-56222-0020 WEREN'T YOU PERFECTLY ASTONISHED WHEN YOU FOUND OUT HOW MANY OTHER PLAYS THERE WERE OF HIS I ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE WAS NOTHING BUT HAMLET AND ROMEO AND JULIET AND MACBETH
6032-56222-0021 AND KING LEAR AND THAT ONE THAT ROBSON AND CRANE HAVE OH YES COMEDY OF ERRORS SO YOU SEE HOW RIDICULOUS THIS YOUNG GIRL BY THE BETRAYAL OF SUCH IGNORANCE
6032-56222-0022 MADE HERSELF IN CONVERSATION WITH A CULTURED YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHOSE GOOD OPINION SHE WAS MOST ANXIOUS TO WIN AND YET TO TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT BOOKS IS NOT WELL IT OFTEN MARKS THE PEDANTIC AND EGOTISTIC CHARACTER
6032-56222-0023 IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT UNLESS ONE HAPPENS TO MEET A VERY CONGENIAL MIND AMONG CONVERSERS IN GENERAL SOCIETY TO INTRODUCE THE SUBJECT OF BOOKS IS LIABLE TO BE MISCONSTRUED
6032-56222-0024 IT IS NOT VERY LONG SINCE ANOTHER POPULAR MODERN NOVELIST HELD UP TO SCORN AND RIDICULE THE YOUNG WOMAN WHOSE PARTICULAR AMBITION SEEMED TO BE TO LET SOCIETY KNOW WHAT AN IMMENSE NUMBER OF BOOKS SHE HAD BEEN READING
6032-56222-0025 NEVERTHELESS ONE MUST HAVE A GOOD GROUNDWORK OF KNOWLEDGE OF BOOKS IN ORDER TO AVOID MISTAKES SUCH AS POOR IRENE MADE IN TALKING WITH YOUNG COREY
6032-56222-0026 GOOD SENSE INTELLIGENCE AND A GENUINE INTEREST IN HER COMPANIONS AND THE WORLD AROUND HER IS OBSERVING AND CAN SPEAK GRAMMATICALLY WITHOUT HESITATING KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND I
6032-56222-0027 AND YOU AND ME WHICH I AM SORRY TO SAY A GREAT MANY YOUNG GIRLS OF MY ACQUAINTANCE DO NOT FOR I CONSTANTLY HEAR THEM SAYING HE BROUGHT YOU AND I A BOUQUET OR YOU AND ME ARE INVITED TO TEA THIS EVENING
6032-56222-0028 SHE CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE A PLEASANT AND ENTERTAINING CONVERSER IF SHE AVOIDS CERTAIN THINGS AS FOR INSTANCE ONE SHE MUST AVOID TALKING ABOUT HERSELF HER EXPLOITS
6032-56222-0029 HER ACQUIREMENTS HER ENTERTAINMENTS
6032-56222-0030 ESPECIALLY SHOULD SHE AVOID SEEKING TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION BY FREQUENT MENTION OF ADVANTAGEOUS FRIENDS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THE GREATEST OBSERVER AND COMMENTATOR UPON MANNERS THAT EVER WROTE
6032-56222-0031 WAS MISTER EMERSON IN ONE OF HIS ESSAYS HE SAYS YOU SHALL NOT ENUMERATE YOUR BRILLIANT ACQUAINTANCES NOR TELL ME BY THEIR TITLES WHAT BOOKS YOU HAVE READ
6032-56222-0032 TWO SHE MUST AVOID A LOUD TONE OF VOICE AND ALSO AVOID LAUGHING TOO MUCH AND TOO EASILY TO LAUGH ALOUD IS A DANGEROUS THING
6032-56222-0033 UNLESS ALL NOISE AND HARSHNESS HAVE BEEN CULTIVATED OUT OF THE VOICE AS OUGHT TO BE DONE IN EVERY GOOD SCHOOL THE CULTURE OF THE VOICE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS IN MAKING A PLEASANT CONVERSER
6032-56222-0034 AMERICAN GIRLS AND WOMEN ARE ACCUSED BY CULTIVATED FOREIGNERS OF HAVING LOUD HARSH STRIDENT VOICES AND THERE IS TOO MUCH TRUTH IN THE ACCUSATION
6032-56222-0035 NOR IS THERE ANY EXCUSE FOR UNPLEASANT HARSH ROUGH NASAL TONES OF VOICE IN THESE DAYS WHEN IN EVERY GOOD SCHOOL INSTRUCTION IS GIVEN IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE VOICE FOR READING AND CONVERSATION
6032-56222-0036 THE CAUSE OF HARSHNESS AND LOUDNESS IS OFTEN MERE CARELESSNESS ON THE PART OF YOUNG PEOPLE BUT TALKING IN TOO LOUD A TONE IS SCARCELY LESS UNPLEASANT TO THE LISTENERS
6032-56222-0037 THAN THE USE OF TOO LOW A TONE WHICH IS GENERALLY AN AFFECTATION THREE SHE MUST AVOID FREQUENT ATTEMPTS AT WIT AVOID PUNNING
6032-56222-0038 WHICH IS THE CHEAPEST POSSIBLE FORM OF WIT AND AVOID SARCASM THE TALENT FOR BEING SARCASTIC IS A MOST DANGEROUS ONE NO ONE EVER KNEW A SARCASTIC WOMAN WHO COULD KEEP FRIENDS
6032-56222-0039 THE TEMPTATION TO BE BRIGHT AND INTERESTING AND TO ATTRACT ATTENTION BY THE USE OF SARCASM IS VERY STRONG FOR NEARLY ALL WILL BE INTERESTED IN IT AND ENJOY IT FOR A LITTLE
6032-56222-0040 THAT ABOUT COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE MUCH HARM MUCH BLUNTING OF FINE SENSIBILITIES MUCH DESTRUCTION OF THAT DELICATE MODESTY WHICH IS THE PRICELESS DOWER OF YOUNG GIRLHOOD
6032-56222-0041 COMES OF SUCH JESTING AND JOKING WHERE IT IS PERMITTED WITHOUT RESTRAINT OR REPROOF A YOUNG GIRL MAY NOT BE CALLED UPON TO REPROVE IT BUT SHE CERTAINLY CAN SHUN
6032-56222-0042 THAT TO BE A GOOD CONVERSER YOU MUST BE A GOOD LISTENER VERY OFTEN PEOPLE ACQUIRE A PLEASANT REPUTATION AND POPULARITY IN SOCIETY BY THE EXERCISE OF THIS TALENT ALONE
6032-56222-0043 THAT OF LISTENING WITH ATTENTION AND INTEREST TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY BE ESPECIALLY CAREFUL TO AVOID INTERRUPTING ONE WHO IS SPEAKING MANY A FINE AND NOBLE THOUGHT
6032-56222-0044 MANY AN INTERESTING DISCUSSION IS BROKEN OFF AND LOST BY THE IRRELEVANT INTERRUPTION OF SOME THOUGHTLESS PERSON ONE REASON WHY THE ART OF CONVERSATION HAS SO DEGENERATED IN THESE DAYS
6032-56222-0045 AS WELL AS WIDE READING AND INFORMATION HAVE GIVEN YOU THE RIGHT TO EXPRESS FREELY YOUR OPINIONS IN SOCIETY IT WILL BE WELL TO LISTEN A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN YOU SPEAK ESPECIALLY WHEN IN THE COMPANY OF YOUR ELDERS
6032-56222-0046 AVOID ALL SENTIMENTALITY OR THE DISCUSSION OF SUBJECTS THAT WOULD EXPOSE THE PRIVATE AND SACRED FEELINGS OF THE HEART DO NOT QUOTE POETRY
6032-56222-0047 DO NOT ASK PEOPLE'S OPINIONS ON DELICATE AND INDIVIDUAL QUESTIONS I HAVE HEARD A YOUNG BOARDING SCHOOL GRADUATE EMBARRASS A WHOLE ROOM FULL OF EXCELLENT AND EDUCATED PEOPLE BY ASKING A YOUNG GENTLEMAN
6032-56222-0048 MORE THAN TO THE DOINGS OR SAYINGS OF OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS WAY YOU WILL AVOID THAT BANE OF SOCIAL CONVERSATION GOSSIP IN ALL SOCIAL RELATIONS
6032-56222-0049 STRIVE TO BE WORTHY OF THE CONFIDENCE AND RESPECT AND LOVE OF YOUR ASSOCIATES AND ALL YOUR RELATIONS TO SOCIETY WILL BE EASILY AND NATURALLY
