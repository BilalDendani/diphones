6777-76701-0000 THAT THE RUFFIAN IS TOLERATED AMONG US TO AN EXTENT THAT GOES BEYOND ALL UNRUFFIANLY ENDURANCE I TAKE THE LIBERTY TO BELIEVE THAT IF THE RUFFIAN BESETS MY LIFE A PROFESSIONAL RUFFIAN AT LARGE IN THE OPEN STREETS OF A GREAT CITY
6777-76701-0001 NOTORIOUSLY HAVING NO OTHER CALLING THAN THAT OF RUFFIAN AND OF DISQUIETING AND DESPOILING ME AS I GO PEACEFULLY ABOUT MY LAWFUL BUSINESS INTERFERING WITH NO ONE THEN THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH I HAVE THE GREAT CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE
6777-76701-0002 IS IT POSSIBLE WHAT A WONDERFUL POLICE HERE IS A STRAIGHT BROAD PUBLIC THOROUGHFARE OF IMMENSE RESORT HALF A MILE LONG GAS LIGHTED BY NIGHT WITH A GREAT
6777-76701-0003 GAS LIGHTED RAILWAY STATION IN IT EXTRA THE STREET LAMPS FULL OF SHOPS TRAVERSED BY TWO POPULAR CROSS THOROUGHFARES OF CONSIDERABLE TRAFFIC ITSELF THE MAIN ROAD TO THE SOUTH OF LONDON AND THE ADMIRABLE POLICE HAVE
6777-76701-0004 AFTER LONG INFESTMENT OF THIS DARK AND LONELY SPOT BY A GANG OF RUFFIANS ACTUALLY GOT HOLD OF TWO OF THEM WHY CAN IT BE DOUBTED THAT ANY MAN OF FAIR LONDON KNOWLEDGE
6777-76701-0005 AND COMMON RESOLUTION ARMED WITH THE POWERS OF THE LAW COULD HAVE CAPTURED
6777-76701-0006 THE SAVING UP OF THE RUFFIAN CLASS BY THE MAGISTRACY AND POLICE TO THE CONVENTIONAL PRESERVING OF THEM AS IF THEY WERE PARTRIDGES THAT THEIR NUMBER AND AUDACITY MUST BE IN GREAT PART REFERRED
6777-76701-0007 WHY IS A NOTORIOUS THIEF AND RUFFIAN EVER LEFT AT LARGE HE NEVER TURNS HIS LIBERTY TO ANY ACCOUNT BUT VIOLENCE AND PLUNDER HE NEVER DID A DAY'S WORK
6777-76701-0008 AS A PROVED NOTORIOUS THIEF
6777-76701-0009 WHEN HE COMES OUT HE IS SURELY AS NOTORIOUS A THIEF AS HE WAS WHEN HE WENT IN THEN SEND HIM BACK AGAIN JUST HEAVEN CRIES THE SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION
6777-76701-0010 I DEMAND TO HAVE THE RUFFIAN EMPLOYED PERFORCE IN HEWING WOOD AND DRAWING WATER SOMEWHERE FOR THE GENERAL SERVICE INSTEAD OF HEWING AT HER MAJESTY'S SUBJECTS AND DRAWING THEIR WATCHES OUT OF THEIR POCKETS
6777-76701-0011 AS TO THE MAGISTRACY WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT BUT WHAT THE POLICE CHOOSE TO TELL THEM THERE ARE DISORDERLY CLASSES OF MEN WHO ARE NOT THIEVES AS RAILWAY NAVIGATORS
6777-76701-0012 BRICKMAKERS WOOD SAWYERS COSTERMONGERS THESE CLASSES ARE OFTEN DISORDERLY AND TROUBLESOME BUT IT IS MOSTLY AMONG THEMSELVES AND AT ANY RATE THEY HAVE THEIR INDUSTRIOUS AVOCATIONS
6777-76701-0013 THEY WORK EARLY AND LATE AND WORK HARD THE GENERIC RUFFIAN HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR WHAT IS TENDERLY CALLED THE ROUGH ELEMENT IS EITHER A THIEF OR THE COMPANION OF THIEVES
6777-76701-0014 WHEN HE INFAMOUSLY MOLESTS WOMEN COMING OUT OF CHAPEL ON SUNDAY EVENINGS FOR WHICH I WOULD HAVE HIS BACK SCARIFIED OFTEN AND DEEP IT IS NOT ONLY FOR THE GRATIFICATION OF HIS PLEASANT INSTINCTS
6777-76701-0015 BUT THAT THERE MAY BE A CONFUSION RAISED BY WHICH EITHER HE OR HIS FRIENDS MAY PROFIT IN THE COMMISSION OF HIGHWAY ROBBERIES OR IN PICKING POCKETS WHEN HE GETS A POLICE CONSTABLE DOWN AND KICKS HIM HELPLESS FOR LIFE
6777-76701-0016 IT IS BECAUSE THAT CONSTABLE ONCE DID HIS DUTY IN BRINGING HIM TO JUSTICE WHEN HE RUSHES INTO THE BAR OF A PUBLIC HOUSE AND SCOOPS AN EYE OUT OF ONE OF THE COMPANY THERE OR BITES HIS EAR OFF
6777-76701-0017 IT IS BECAUSE THE MAN HE MAIMS GAVE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM WHEN HE AND A LINE OF COMRADES EXTENDING ACROSS THE FOOTWAY SAY OF THAT SOLITARY MOUNTAIN SPUR OF THE ABRUZZI THE WATERLOO ROAD ADVANCE TOWARDS ME
6777-76701-0018 SKYLARKING AMONG THEMSELVES MY PURSE OR SHIRT PIN IS IN PREDESTINED PERIL FROM HIS PLAYFULNESS ALWAYS A RUFFIAN ALWAYS A THIEF ALWAYS A THIEF ALWAYS A RUFFIAN NOW WHEN I
6777-76701-0019 WHO AM NOT PAID TO KNOW THESE THINGS KNOW THEM DAILY ON THE EVIDENCE OF MY SENSES AND EXPERIENCE WHEN I KNOW THAT THE RUFFIAN NEVER JOSTLES A LADY IN THE STREETS OR KNOCKS A HAT OFF BUT IN ORDER THAT THE THIEF MAY PROFIT
6777-76701-0020 IS IT SURPRISING THAT I SHOULD REQUIRE FROM THOSE WHO ARE PAID TO KNOW THESE THINGS PREVENTION OF THEM LOOK AT THIS GROUP AT A STREET CORNER NUMBER ONE IS A SHIRKING FELLOW OF FIVE AND TWENTY
6777-76701-0021 IN AN ILL FAVOURED AND ILL SAVOURED SUIT HIS TROUSERS OF CORDUROY HIS COAT OF SOME INDISCERNIBLE GROUNDWORK FOR THE DEPOSITION OF GREASE HIS NECKERCHIEF LIKE AN EEL HIS COMPLEXION LIKE DIRTY DOUGH
6777-76701-0022 HIS MANGY FUR CAP PULLED LOW UPON HIS BEETLE BROWS TO HIDE THE PRISON CUT OF HIS HAIR HIS HANDS ARE IN HIS POCKETS HE PUTS THEM THERE WHEN THEY ARE IDLE AS NATURALLY AS IN OTHER PEOPLE'S POCKETS WHEN THEY ARE BUSY
6777-76701-0023 FOR HE KNOWS THAT THEY ARE NOT ROUGHENED BY WORK AND THAT THEY TELL A TALE HENCE WHENEVER HE TAKES ONE OUT TO DRAW A SLEEVE ACROSS HIS NOSE WHICH IS OFTEN FOR HE HAS WEAK EYES
6777-76701-0024 AND A CONSTITUTIONAL COLD IN HIS HEAD HE RESTORES IT TO ITS POCKET IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS NUMBER TWO IS A BURLY BRUTE OF FIVE AND THIRTY IN A TALL STIFF HAT IS A COMPOSITE
6777-76701-0025 AS TO HIS CLOTHES OF BETTING MAN AND FIGHTING MAN IS WHISKERED HAS A STARING PIN IN HIS BREAST ALONG WITH HIS RIGHT HAND HAS INSOLENT AND CRUEL EYES LARGE SHOULDERS STRONG LEGS
6777-76701-0026 BOOTED AND TIPPED FOR KICKING NUMBER THREE IS FORTY YEARS OF AGE IS SHORT THICK SET STRONG AND BOW LEGGED WEARS KNEE CORDS AND WHITE STOCKINGS A VERY LONG SLEEVED WAISTCOAT
6777-76701-0027 A VERY LARGE NECKERCHIEF DOUBLED OR TREBLED ROUND HIS THROAT AND A CRUMPLED WHITE HAT CROWNS HIS GHASTLY PARCHMENT FACE THIS FELLOW LOOKS LIKE AN EXECUTED POSTBOY OF OTHER DAYS CUT DOWN FROM THE GALLOWS TOO SOON
6777-76701-0028 NUMBERS FIVE SIX AND SEVEN ARE HULKING IDLE SLOUCHING YOUNG MEN PATCHED AND SHABBY TOO SHORT IN THE SLEEVES AND TOO TIGHT IN THE LEGS SLIMILY CLOTHED FOUL SPOKEN
6777-76701-0029 REPULSIVE WRETCHES INSIDE AND OUT IN ALL THE PARTY THERE OBTAINS A CERTAIN TWITCHING CHARACTER OF MOUTH AND FURTIVENESS OF EYE THAT HINT HOW THE COWARD IS LURKING UNDER THE BULLY THE HINT IS QUITE CORRECT
6777-76701-0030 FOR THEY ARE A SLINKING SNEAKING SET FAR MORE PRONE TO LIE DOWN ON THEIR BACKS AND KICK OUT WHEN IN DIFFICULTY THAN TO MAKE A STAND FOR IT THIS MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE STREET MUD ON THE BACKS OF NUMBERS FIVE
6777-76701-0031 SIX AND SEVEN BEING MUCH FRESHER THAN THE STALE SPLASHES ON THEIR LEGS THESE ENGAGING GENTRY A POLICE CONSTABLE STANDS CONTEMPLATING HIS STATION WITH A RESERVE OF ASSISTANCE IS VERY NEAR AT HAND
6777-76701-0032 THEY CANNOT PRETEND TO ANY TRADE NOT EVEN TO BE PORTERS OR MESSENGERS IT WOULD BE IDLE IF THEY DID FOR HE KNOWS THEM AND THEY KNOW THAT HE KNOWS THEM TO BE NOTHING BUT PROFESSED THIEVES AND RUFFIANS
6777-76701-0033 HE KNOWS WHERE THEY RESORT KNOWS BY WHAT SLANG NAMES THEY CALL ONE ANOTHER KNOWS HOW OFTEN THEY HAVE BEEN IN PRISON AND HOW LONG AND FOR WHAT ALL THIS IS KNOWN AT HIS STATION TOO AND IS
6777-76701-0034 OR OUGHT TO BE KNOWN AT SCOTLAND YARD TOO BUT DOES HE KNOW OR DOES HIS STATION KNOW OR DOES SCOTLAND YARD KNOW OR DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHY THESE FELLOWS SHOULD BE HERE AT LIBERTY WHEN AS REPUTED THIEVES
6777-76701-0035 TO WHOM A WHOLE DIVISION OF POLICE COULD SWEAR THEY MIGHT ALL BE UNDER LOCK AND KEY AT HARD LABOUR NOT HE
6777-76701-0036 THAT THESE ARE MEMBERS OF THE NOTORIOUS GANG WHICH ACCORDING TO THE NEWSPAPER POLICE OFFICE REPORTS OF THIS LAST PAST SEPTEMBER HAVE SO LONG INFESTED THE AWFUL SOLITUDES OF THE WATERLOO ROAD
6777-76701-0037 AND OUT OF WHICH ALMOST IMPREGNABLE FASTNESSES THE POLICE HAVE AT LENGTH DRAGGED TWO TO THE UNSPEAKABLE ADMIRATION OF ALL GOOD CIVILIANS THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS CONTEMPLATIVE HABIT
6777-76701-0038 ON THE PART OF THE EXECUTIVE A HABIT TO BE LOOKED FOR IN A HERMIT BUT NOT IN A POLICE SYSTEM ARE FAMILIAR TO US ALL THE RUFFIAN BECOMES ONE OF THE ESTABLISHED ORDERS OF THE BODY POLITIC
6777-76701-0039 UNDER THE PLAYFUL NAME OF ROUGH AS IF HE WERE MERELY A PRACTICAL JOKER HIS MOVEMENTS AND SUCCESSES ARE RECORDED ON PUBLIC OCCASIONS WHETHER HE MUSTERED IN LARGE NUMBERS OR SMALL
6777-76701-0040 AMIABLE HORSE PLAY AND A GRACIOUS CONSIDERATION FOR LIFE AND LIMB ALL THIS IS CHRONICLED AS IF HE WERE AN INSTITUTION IS THERE ANY CITY IN EUROPE OUT OF ENGLAND IN WHICH THESE TERMS ARE HELD
6777-76701-0041 WITH THE PESTS OF SOCIETY OR IN WHICH AT THIS DAY
6777-76701-0042 NOT THIEVES YET BUT TRAINING FOR SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS IN THE CRIMINAL COURT UNIVERSITIES MOLEST QUIET PEOPLE AND THEIR PROPERTY TO AN EXTENT THAT IS HARDLY CREDIBLE THE THROWING OF STONES IN THE STREETS
6777-76701-0043 HAS BECOME A DANGEROUS AND DESTRUCTIVE OFFENCE WHICH SURELY COULD HAVE GOT TO NO GREATER HEIGHT THOUGH WE HAD HAD NO POLICE BUT OUR OWN RIDING WHIPS AND WALKING STICKS THE POLICE
6777-76701-0044 TO WHICH I MYSELF APPEAL ON THESE OCCASIONS THE THROWING OF STONES AT THE WINDOWS OF RAILWAY CARRIAGES IN MOTION AN ACT OF WANTON WICKEDNESS WITH THE VERY ARCH FIEND'S HAND IN IT HAD BECOME A CRYING EVIL
6777-76701-0045 WHEN THE RAILWAY COMPANIES FORCED IT ON POLICE NOTICE CONSTABULAR CONTEMPLATION HAD UNTIL THEN BEEN THE ORDER OF THE DAY WITHIN THESE TWELVE MONTHS THERE AROSE AMONG THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN OF LONDON
6777-76701-0046 TO BE THUS HUMOROUSLY TORN FROM HER FACE
6777-76701-0047 ON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE TO ANOTHER YOUNG RUFFIAN WHO IN FULL DAYLIGHT EARLY ON A SUMMER EVENING HAD NEARLY THROWN A MODEST YOUNG WOMAN INTO A SWOON OF INDIGNATION AND CONFUSION BY HIS SHAMEFUL MANNER
6777-76701-0048 OF ATTACKING HER WITH THIS CRY AS SHE HARMLESSLY PASSED ALONG BEFORE ME
6777-76701-0049 SOME TIME SINCE AWAKENED A LITTLE PLEASANTRY BY WRITING OF HIS OWN EXPERIENCE OF THE RUFFIAN OF THE STREETS I HAVE SEEN THE RUFFIAN ACT IN EXACT ACCORDANCE WITH MISTER CARLYLE'S DESCRIPTION INNUMERABLE TIMES
6777-76701-0050 AND I NEVER SAW HIM CHECKED THE BLARING USE OF THE VERY WORST LANGUAGE POSSIBLE IN OUR PUBLIC THOROUGHFARES ESPECIALLY IN THOSE SET APART FOR RECREATION
6777-76701-0051 IS ANOTHER DISGRACE TO US AND ANOTHER RESULT OF CONSTABULAR CONTEMPLATION THE LIKE OF WHICH I HAVE NEVER HEARD IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY TO WHICH MY UNCOMMERCIAL TRAVELS HAVE EXTENDED YEARS AGO
6777-76701-0052 WHEN I HAD A NEAR INTEREST IN CERTAIN CHILDREN WHO WERE SENT WITH THEIR NURSES FOR AIR AND EXERCISE INTO THE REGENT'S PARK I FOUND THIS EVIL TO BE SO ABHORRENT AND HORRIBLE THERE THAT I CALLED PUBLIC ATTENTION TO IT
6777-76701-0053 AND ALSO TO ITS CONTEMPLATIVE RECEPTION BY THE POLICE LOOKING AFTERWARDS INTO THE NEWEST POLICE ACT AND FINDING THAT THE OFFENCE WAS PUNISHABLE UNDER IT I RESOLVED WHEN STRIKING OCCASION SHOULD ARISE
6777-76701-0054 TO TRY MY HAND AS PROSECUTOR THE OCCASION AROSE SOON ENOUGH AND I RAN THE FOLLOWING GAUNTLET THE UTTERER OF THE BASE COIN IN QUESTION WAS A GIRL OF SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN WHO WITH A SUITABLE ATTENDANCE
6777-76701-0055 OF BLACKGUARDS YOUTHS AND BOYS WAS FLAUNTING ALONG THE STREETS RETURNING FROM AN IRISH FUNERAL IN A PROGRESS INTERSPERSED WITH SINGING AND DANCING SHE HAD TURNED ROUND TO ME AND EXPRESSED HERSELF IN THE MOST AUDIBLE MANNER
6777-76701-0056 I ATTENDED THE PARTY ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WAY FOR A MILE FURTHER AND THEN ENCOUNTERED A POLICE CONSTABLE THE PARTY HAD MADE THEMSELVES MERRY AT MY EXPENSE UNTIL NOW BUT SEEING ME SPEAK
6777-76701-0057 TO THE CONSTABLE ITS MALE MEMBERS INSTANTLY TOOK TO THEIR HEELS LEAVING THE GIRL ALONE I ASKED THE CONSTABLE DID HE KNOW MY NAME YES HE DID TAKE THAT GIRL INTO CUSTODY ON MY CHARGE
6777-76701-0058 FOR USING BAD LANGUAGE IN THE STREETS HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A CHARGE I HAD WOULD HE TAKE MY WORD THAT HE SHOULD GET INTO NO TROUBLE YES
6777-76701-0059 SO HE TOOK THE GIRL AND I WENT HOME FOR MY POLICE ACT WITH THIS POTENT INSTRUMENT IN MY POCKET I LITERALLY AS WELL AS FIGURATIVELY RETURNED TO THE CHARGE AND PRESENTED MYSELF AT THE POLICE STATION
6777-76701-0060 OF THE DISTRICT THERE I FOUND ON DUTY A VERY INTELLIGENT INSPECTOR THEY ARE ALL INTELLIGENT MEN WHO LIKEWISE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A CHARGE I SHOWED HIM MY CLAUSE
6777-76701-0061 IT WAS PLAIN AND I ENGAGED TO WAIT UPON THE SUBURBAN MAGISTRATE TO MORROW MORNING AT TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I PUT MY POLICE ACT IN MY POCKET AGAIN AND WAITED ON THE SUBURBAN MAGISTRATE I WAS NOT QUITE SO COURTEOUSLY RECEIVED BY HIM
6777-76701-0062 AS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN BY THE LORD CHANCELLOR OR THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE BUT THAT WAS A QUESTION OF GOOD BREEDING ON THE SUBURBAN MAGISTRATE'S PART AND I HAD MY CLAUSE READY WITH ITS LEAF TURNED DOWN
6777-76701-0063 WHICH WAS ENOUGH FOR ME CONFERENCE TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THE MAGISTRATE AND CLERK RESPECTING THE CHARGE DURING CONFERENCE I WAS EVIDENTLY REGARDED AS A MUCH MORE OBJECTIONABLE PERSON THAN THE PRISONER ONE GIVING TROUBLE BY COMING THERE VOLUNTARILY
6777-76701-0064 WHICH THE PRISONER COULD NOT BE ACCUSED OF DOING THE PRISONER HAD BEEN GOT UP SINCE I LAST HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING HER WITH A GREAT EFFECT OF WHITE APRON AND STRAW BONNET SHE REMINDED ME OF AN ELDER SISTER OF RED
6777-76701-0065 RIDING HOOD AND I SEEMED TO REMIND THE SYMPATHISING CHIMNEY SWEEP BY WHOM SHE WAS ATTENDED OF THE WOLF THE MAGISTRATE WAS DOUBTFUL MISTER UNCOMMERCIAL TRAVELLER WHETHER THIS CHARGE COULD BE ENTERTAINED IT WAS NOT KNOWN
6777-76701-0066 MISTER UNCOMMERCIAL TRAVELLER REPLIED THAT HE WISHED IT WERE BETTER KNOWN AND THAT IF HE COULD AFFORD THE LEISURE HE WOULD USE HIS ENDEAVOURS TO MAKE IT SO THERE WAS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT HOWEVER HE CONTENDED HERE WAS THE CLAUSE
6777-76701-0067 THE CLAUSE WAS HANDED IN AND MORE CONFERENCE RESULTED AFTER WHICH I WAS ASKED THE EXTRAORDINARY QUESTION MISTER UNCOMMERCIAL DO YOU REALLY WISH THIS GIRL TO BE SENT TO PRISON TO WHICH I GRIMLY ANSWERED
6777-76701-0068 STARING IF I DIDN'T WHY SHOULD I TAKE THE TROUBLE TO COME HERE FINALLY I WAS SWORN AND GAVE MY AGREEABLE EVIDENCE IN DETAIL AND WHITE RIDING HOOD WAS FINED TEN SHILLINGS UNDER THE CLAUSE
6777-76701-0069 OR SENT TO PRISON FOR SO MANY DAYS WHY LORD BLESS YOU SIR SAID THE POLICE OFFICER WHO SHOWED ME OUT WITH A GREAT ENJOYMENT OF THE JEST OF HER HAVING BEEN GOT UP SO EFFECTIVELY AND CAUSED SO MUCH HESITATION
6777-76701-0070 IF SHE GOES TO PRISON THAT WILL BE NOTHING NEW TO HER SHE COMES FROM CHARLES STREET DRURY LANE THE POLICE ALL THINGS CONSIDERED ARE AN EXCELLENT FORCE AND I HAVE BORNE MY SMALL TESTIMONY TO THEIR MERITS
6777-76701-0071 CONSTABULAR CONTEMPLATION IS THE RESULT OF A BAD SYSTEM A SYSTEM WHICH IS ADMINISTERED NOT INVENTED BY THE MAN IN CONSTABLE'S UNIFORM EMPLOYED AT TWENTY SHILLINGS A WEEK HE HAS HIS ORDERS
6777-76701-0072 AND WOULD BE MARKED FOR DISCOURAGEMENT IF HE OVERSTEPPED THEM THAT THE SYSTEM IS BAD THERE NEEDS NO LENGTHENED ARGUMENT TO PROVE BECAUSE THE FACT IS SELF EVIDENT
6777-76701-0073 THE RESULTS THAT HAVE ATTENDED IT COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE COME TO PASS WHO WILL SAY THAT UNDER A GOOD SYSTEM OUR STREETS COULD HAVE GOT INTO THEIR PRESENT STATE THE OBJECTION TO THE WHOLE POLICE SYSTEM AS CONCERNING THE RUFFIAN
6777-76701-0074 MAY BE STATED AND ITS FAILURE EXEMPLIFIED AS FOLLOWS IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT ON ALL GREAT OCCASIONS WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER IN NUMBERS THE MASS OF THE ENGLISH PEOPLE ARE THEIR OWN TRUSTWORTHY POLICE IT IS WELL KNOWN
6777-76701-0075 THAT WHERESOEVER THERE IS COLLECTED TOGETHER ANY FAIR GENERAL REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE A RESPECT FOR LAW AND ORDER AND A DETERMINATION TO DISCOUNTENANCE LAWLESSNESS AND DISORDER MAY BE RELIED UPON AS TO ONE ANOTHER
6777-76701-0076 THE PEOPLE ARE A VERY GOOD POLICE AND YET ARE QUITE WILLING IN THEIR GOOD NATURE THAT THE STIPENDIARY POLICE SHOULD HAVE THE CREDIT OF THE PEOPLE'S MODERATION BUT WE ARE ALL OF US POWERLESS AGAINST THE RUFFIAN BECAUSE WE SUBMIT TO THE LAW
6777-76701-0077 AND IT IS HIS ONLY TRADE BY SUPERIOR FORCE AND BY VIOLENCE TO DEFY IT MOREOVER WE ARE CONSTANTLY ADMONISHED FROM HIGH PLACES LIKE SO MANY SUNDAY SCHOOL CHILDREN OUT FOR A HOLIDAY OF BUNS AND MILK AND WATER
6777-76701-0078 THAT WE ARE NOT TO TAKE THE LAW INTO OUR OWN HANDS BUT ARE TO HAND OUR DEFENCE OVER TO IT IT IS CLEAR THAT THE COMMON ENEMY TO BE PUNISHED AND EXTERMINATED FIRST OF ALL IS THE RUFFIAN IT IS CLEAR THAT HE IS
6777-76701-0079 OF ALL OTHERS THE OFFENDER FOR WHOSE REPRESSAL WE MAINTAIN A COSTLY SYSTEM OF POLICE HIM THEREFORE WE EXPRESSLY PRESENT TO THE POLICE TO DEAL WITH CONSCIOUS THAT ON THE WHOLE WE CAN AND DO
6777-76701-0080 DEAL REASONABLY WELL WITH ONE ANOTHER HIM THE POLICE DEAL WITH SO INEFFICIENTLY AND ABSURDLY THAT HE FLOURISHES AND MULTIPLIES AND WITH ALL HIS EVIL DEEDS UPON HIS HEAD AS NOTORIOUSLY AS HIS HAT IS
