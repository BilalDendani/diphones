5671-50486-0000 EDWARD HAD REACHED HIS NATIVE COUNTRY BEFORE HE COULD AS USUAL ON FORMER OCCASIONS LOOK ROUND FOR ENJOYMENT UPON THE FACE OF NATURE HE THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE LEAVING EDINBURGH BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE THAT PLEASURE
5671-50486-0001 WHICH ALMOST ALL FEEL WHO RETURN TO A VERDANT POPULOUS AND HIGHLY CULTIVATED COUNTRY FROM SCENES OF WASTE DESOLATION OR OF SOLITARY AND MELANCHOLY GRANDEUR
5671-50486-0002 BUT HOW WERE THOSE FEELINGS ENHANCED WHEN HE ENTERED ON THE DOMAIN SO LONG POSSESSED BY HIS FOREFATHERS RECOGNISED THE OLD OAKS OF WAVERLEY CHACE THOUGHT WITH WHAT DELIGHT HE SHOULD INTRODUCE ROSE TO ALL HIS FAVOURITE HAUNTS
5671-50486-0003 THE HAPPINESS OF THEIR MEETING WAS NOT TARNISHED BY A SINGLE WORD OF REPROACH ON THE CONTRARY WHATEVER PAIN SIR EVERARD AND MISSUS RACHEL HAD FELT DURING WAVERLEY'S PERILOUS ENGAGEMENT WITH THE YOUNG CHEVALIER
5671-50486-0004 IT ASSORTED TOO WELL WITH THE PRINCIPLES IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP TO INCUR REPROBATION OR EVEN CENSURE COLONEL TALBOT ALSO HAD SMOOTHED THE WAY WITH GREAT ADDRESS FOR EDWARD'S FAVOURABLE RECEPTION BY DWELLING UPON HIS GALLANT BEHAVIOUR IN THE MILITARY CHARACTER
5671-50486-0005 PARTICULARLY HIS BRAVERY AND GENEROSITY AT PRESTON UNTIL WARMED AT THE IDEA OF THEIR NEPHEW'S ENGAGING IN SINGLE COMBAT MAKING PRISONER AND SAVING FROM SLAUGHTER SO DISTINGUISHED AN OFFICER AS THE COLONEL HIMSELF THE IMAGINATION OF THE BARONET AND HIS SISTER
5671-50486-0006 RANKED THE EXPLOITS OF EDWARD WITH THOSE OF WILIBERT HILDEBRAND AND NIGEL THE VAUNTED HEROES OF THEIR LINE THE APPEARANCE OF WAVERLEY EMBROWNED BY EXERCISE AND DIGNIFIED BY THE HABITS OF MILITARY DISCIPLINE
5671-50486-0007 HAD ACQUIRED AN ATHLETIC AND HARDY CHARACTER WHICH NOT ONLY VERIFIED THE COLONEL'S NARRATION BUT SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED ALL THE INHABITANTS OF WAVERLEY HONOUR THEY CROWDED TO SEE TO HEAR HIM AND TO SING HIS PRAISES
5671-50486-0008 MISTER PEMBROKE WHO SECRETLY EXTOLLED HIS SPIRIT AND COURAGE IN EMBRACING THE GENUINE CAUSE OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND CENSURED HIS PUPIL GENTLY NEVERTHELESS FOR BEING SO CARELESS OF HIS MANUSCRIPTS WHICH INDEED HE SAID
5671-50486-0009 HAD OCCASIONED HIM SOME PERSONAL INCONVENIENCE AS UPON THE BARONET'S BEING ARRESTED BY A KING'S MESSENGER HE HAD DEEMED IT PRUDENT TO RETIRE TO A CONCEALMENT CALLED THE PRIEST'S HOLE FROM THE USE IT HAD BEEN PUT TO IN FORMER DAYS WHERE HE ASSURED OUR HERO
5671-50486-0010 NOT TO MENTION THAT SOMETIMES HIS BED HAD NOT BEEN ARRANGED FOR TWO DAYS TOGETHER WAVERLEY'S MIND INVOLUNTARILY TURNED TO THE PATMOS OF THE BARON OF BRADWARDINE WHO WAS WELL PLEASED WITH JANET'S FARE AND A FEW BUNCHES OF STRAW STOWED IN A CLEFT IN THE FRONT OF A SAND CLIFF
5671-50486-0011 BUT HE MADE NO REMARKS UPON A CONTRAST WHICH COULD ONLY MORTIFY HIS WORTHY TUTOR ALL WAS NOW IN A BUSTLE TO PREPARE FOR THE NUPTIALS OF EDWARD AN EVENT TO WHICH THE GOOD OLD BARONET AND MISSUS RACHEL LOOKED FORWARD AS IF TO THE RENEWAL OF THEIR OWN YOUTH
5671-50486-0012 AND THEY NOW CARRIED ON BUSINESS AS MESSRS CLIPPURSE AND HOOKEM THESE WORTHY GENTLEMEN HAD DIRECTIONS TO MAKE THE NECESSARY SETTLEMENTS ON THE MOST SPLENDID SCALE OF LIBERALITY AS IF EDWARD WERE TO WED A PEERESS IN HER OWN RIGHT
5671-50486-0013 WITH HER PATERNAL ESTATE TACKED TO THE FRINGE OF HER ERMINE BUT BEFORE ENTERING UPON A SUBJECT OF PROVERBIAL DELAY I MUST REMIND MY READER OF THE PROGRESS OF A STONE ROLLED DOWNHILL BY AN IDLE TRUANT BOY
5671-50486-0014 A PASTIME AT WHICH I WAS MYSELF EXPERT IN MY MORE JUVENILE YEARS IT MOVES AT FIRST SLOWLY AVOIDING BY INFLECTION EVERY OBSTACLE OF THE LEAST IMPORTANCE BUT WHEN IT HAS ATTAINED ITS FULL IMPULSE AND DRAWS NEAR THE CONCLUSION OF ITS CAREER
5671-50486-0015 IT SMOKES AND THUNDERS DOWN TAKING A ROOD AT EVERY SPRING CLEARING HEDGE AND DITCH LIKE A YORKSHIRE HUNTSMAN AND BECOMING MOST FURIOUSLY RAPID IN ITS COURSE WHEN IT IS NEAREST TO BEING CONSIGNED TO REST FOR EVER
5671-50486-0016 EVEN SUCH IS THE COURSE OF A NARRATIVE LIKE THAT WHICH YOU ARE PERUSING THE EARLIER EVENTS ARE STUDIOUSLY DWELT UPON THAT YOU KIND READER MAY BE INTRODUCED TO THE CHARACTER RATHER BY NARRATIVE THAN BY THE DULLER MEDIUM OF DIRECT DESCRIPTION
5671-50486-0017 BUT WHEN THE STORY DRAWS NEAR ITS CLOSE WE HURRY OVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES HOWEVER IMPORTANT WHICH YOUR IMAGINATION MUST HAVE FORESTALLED AND LEAVE YOU TO SUPPOSE THOSE THINGS WHICH IT WOULD BE ABUSING YOUR PATIENCE TO RELATE AT LENGTH
5671-50486-0018 WE ARE THEREFORE SO FAR FROM ATTEMPTING TO TRACE THE DULL PROGRESS OF MESSRS CLIPPURSE AND HOOKEM OR THAT OF THEIR WORTHY OFFICIAL BRETHREN WHO HAD THE CHARGE OF SUING OUT THE PARDONS OF EDWARD WAVERLEY AND HIS INTENDED FATHER IN LAW
5671-50486-0019 THAT WE CAN BUT TOUCH UPON MATTERS MORE ATTRACTIVE THE MUTUAL EPISTLES FOR EXAMPLE WHICH WERE EXCHANGED BETWEEN SIR EVERARD AND THE BARON UPON THIS OCCASION THOUGH MATCHLESS SPECIMENS OF ELOQUENCE IN THEIR WAY MUST BE CONSIGNED TO MERCILESS OBLIVION
5671-50486-0020 MOREOVER THE READER WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO IMAGINE THAT JOB HOUGHTON AND HIS DAME WERE SUITABLY PROVIDED FOR ALTHOUGH THEY COULD NEVER BE PERSUADED THAT THEIR SON FELL OTHERWISE THAN FIGHTING BY THE YOUNG SQUIRE'S SIDE SO THAT ALICK
5671-50486-0021 WHO AS A LOVER OF TRUTH HAD MADE MANY NEEDLESS ATTEMPTS TO EXPOUND THE REAL CIRCUMSTANCES TO THEM WAS FINALLY ORDERED TO SAY NOT A WORD MORE UPON THE SUBJECT HE INDEMNIFIED HIMSELF HOWEVER BY THE LIBERAL ALLOWANCE OF DESPERATE BATTLES GRISLY EXECUTIONS
5671-50486-0022 AND RAW HEAD AND BLOODY BONE STORIES WITH WHICH HE ASTONISHED THE SERVANTS HALL BUT ALTHOUGH THESE IMPORTANT MATTERS MAY BE BRIEFLY TOLD IN NARRATIVE LIKE A NEWSPAPER REPORT OF A CHANCERY SUIT YET WITH ALL THE URGENCY WHICH WAVERLEY COULD USE THE REAL TIME WHICH THE LAW PROCEEDINGS OCCUPIED
5671-50486-0023 JOINED TO THE DELAY OCCASIONED BY THE MODE OF TRAVELLING AT THAT PERIOD RENDERED IT CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN TWO MONTHS ERE WAVERLEY HAVING LEFT ENGLAND ALIGHTED ONCE MORE AT THE MANSION OF THE LAIRD OF DUCHRAN TO CLAIM THE HAND OF HIS PLIGHTED BRIDE
5671-50486-0024 THE DAY OF HIS MARRIAGE WAS FIXED FOR THE SIXTH AFTER HIS ARRIVAL THE BARON OF BRADWARDINE WITH WHOM BRIDALS CHRISTENINGS AND FUNERALS WERE FESTIVALS OF HIGH AND SOLEMN IMPORT FELT A LITTLE HURT THAT INCLUDING THE FAMILY OF THE DUCHRAN
5671-50486-0025 OR TWO OF HIGHLAND LAIRDS WHO NEVER GOT ON HORSEBACK
5671-50486-0026 BUT HIS PRIDE FOUND SOME CONSOLATION IN REFLECTING THAT HE AND HIS SON IN LAW HAVING BEEN SO LATELY IN ARMS AGAINST GOVERNMENT IT MIGHT GIVE MATTER OF REASONABLE FEAR AND OFFENCE TO THE RULING POWERS
5671-50486-0027 AND FRANK STANLEY ACTED AS BRIDESMAN HAVING JOINED EDWARD WITH THAT VIEW SOON AFTER HIS ARRIVAL LADY EMILY AND COLONEL TALBOT HAD PROPOSED BEING PRESENT BUT LADY EMILY'S HEALTH WHEN THE DAY APPROACHED WAS FOUND INADEQUATE TO THE JOURNEY
5671-50486-0028 IN AMENDS IT WAS ARRANGED THAT EDWARD WAVERLEY AND HIS LADY WHO WITH THE BARON PROPOSED AN IMMEDIATE JOURNEY TO WAVERLEY HONOUR SHOULD IN THEIR WAY SPEND A FEW DAYS AT AN ESTATE WHICH COLONEL TALBOT HAD BEEN TEMPTED TO PURCHASE IN SCOTLAND AS A VERY GREAT BARGAIN
