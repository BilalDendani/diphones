7255-291500-0000 FOR THRUSTING INTO THE HOLES HE MAKES THE PECULIAR ARRANGEMENT OF TOES TWO FORWARD AND TWO BACK AND THE STIFF SPINY TAIL FEATHERS FOR SUPPORTING HIMSELF AGAINST THE SIDE OF A TREE AS HE WORKS
7255-291500-0001 BUT GETTING HIS LIVING SO MEANS HARD WORK AND HE HAS DISCOVERED FOR HIMSELF A MUCH EASIER WAY ONE NOW FREQUENTLY SURPRISES HIM ON THE GROUND IN OLD PASTURES AND ORCHARDS FLOUNDERING ABOUT RATHER AWKWARDLY FOR HIS LITTLE FEET WERE NEVER INTENDED FOR WALKING AFTER THE CRICKETS AND GRASSHOPPERS THAT ABOUND THERE
7255-291500-0002 STILL HE FINDS THE WORK OF CATCHING THEM MUCH EASIER THAN BORING INTO DRY OLD TREES AND THE INSECTS THEMSELVES MUCH LARGER AND MORE SATISFACTORY
7255-291500-0003 A SINGLE GLANCE WILL SHOW HOW MUCH THIS NEW WAY OF LIVING HAS CHANGED HIM FROM THE OTHER WOODPECKERS THE BILL IS NO LONGER STRAIGHT BUT HAS A DECIDED CURVE LIKE THE THRUSHES AND INSTEAD OF THE CHISEL SHAPED EDGE THERE IS A ROUNDED POINT THE RED TUFT ON THE HEAD WHICH MARKS ALL THE WOODPECKER FAMILY WOULD BE TOO CONSPICUOUS ON THE GROUND IN ITS PLACE WE FIND A RED CRESCENT WELL DOWN ON THE NECK AND PARTIALLY HIDDEN BY THE SHORT GRAY FEATHERS ABOUT IT
7255-291500-0004 THE POINT OF THE TONGUE IS LESS HORNY AND FROM THE STIFF POINTS OF THE TAIL FEATHERS LAMINA ARE BEGINNING TO GROW MAKING THEM MORE LIKE OTHER BIRDS
7255-291500-0005 THE HABITS OF THIS BIRD ARE A CURIOUS COMPOUND OF HIS OLD LIFE IN THE WOODS AND HIS NEW PREFERENCE FOR THE OPEN FIELDS AND FARMS SOMETIMES THE NEST IS IN THE VERY HEART OF THE WOODS WHERE THE BIRD GLIDES IN AND OUT SILENT AS A CROW IN NESTING TIME HIS FEEDING PLACE MEANWHILE MAY BE AN OLD PASTURE HALF A MILE AWAY WHERE HE CALLS LOUDLY AND FROLICS ABOUT AS IF HE HAD NEVER A CARE OR A FEAR IN THE WORLD
7255-291500-0006 BUT THE NEST IS NOW MORE FREQUENTLY IN A WILD ORCHARD WHERE THE BIRD FINDS AN OLD KNOT HOLE AND DIGS DOWN THROUGH THE SOFT WOOD MAKING A DEEP NEST WITH VERY LITTLE TROUBLE WHEN THE KNOT HOLE IS NOT WELL SITUATED HE FINDS A LARGE DECAYED LIMB AND DRILLS THROUGH THE OUTER HARD SHELL THEN DIGS DOWN A FOOT OR MORE THROUGH THE SOFT WOOD AND MAKES A NEST
7255-291500-0007 IN THIS NEST THE RAIN NEVER TROUBLES HIM FOR HE VERY PROVIDENTLY DRILLS THE ENTRANCE ON THE UNDER SIDE OF THE LIMB
7255-291500-0008 LIKE MANY OTHER BIRDS HE HAS DISCOVERED THAT THE FARMER IS HIS FRIEND OCCASIONALLY THEREFORE HE NEGLECTS TO BUILD A DEEP NEST SIMPLY HOLLOWING OUT AN OLD KNOT HOLE AND DEPENDING ON THE PRESENCE OF MAN FOR PROTECTION FROM HAWKS AND OWLS AT SUCH TIMES THE BIRD VERY SOON LEARNS TO RECOGNIZE THOSE WHO BELONG IN THE ORCHARD AND LOSES THE EXTREME SHYNESS THAT CHARACTERIZES HIM AT ALL OTHER TIMES
7255-291500-0009 ONCE A FARMER KNOWING MY INTEREST IN BIRDS INVITED ME TO COME AND SEE A GOLDEN WINGED WOODPECKER WHICH IN HER CONFIDENCE HAD BUILT SO SHALLOW A NEST THAT SHE COULD BE SEEN SITTING ON THE EGGS LIKE A ROBIN SHE WAS SO TAME HE SAID THAT IN GOING TO HIS WORK HE SOMETIMES PASSED UNDER THE TREE WITHOUT DISTURBING HER THE MOMENT WE CROSSED THE WALL WITHIN SIGHT OF THE NEST THE BIRD SLIPPED AWAY OUT OF THE ORCHARD
7255-291500-0010 WISHING TO TEST HER WE WITHDREW AND WAITED TILL SHE RETURNED THEN THE FARMER PASSED WITHIN A FEW FEET WITHOUT DISTURBING HER IN THE LEAST TEN MINUTES LATER I FOLLOWED HIM AND THE BIRD FLEW AWAY AGAIN AS I CROSSED THE WALL
7255-291500-0011 THE NOTES OF THE GOLDEN WING MUCH MORE VARIED AND MUSICAL THAN THOSE OF OTHER WOODPECKERS ARE PROBABLY THE RESULTS OF HIS NEW FREE LIFE AND THE MODIFIED TONGUE AND BILL
7255-291500-0012 A CURIOUS HABIT WHICH THE BIRD HAS ADOPTED WITH ADVANCING CIVILIZATION IS THAT OF PROVIDING HIMSELF WITH A SHELTERED SLEEPING PLACE FROM THE STORMS AND COLD OF WINTER LATE IN THE FALL HE FINDS A DESERTED BUILDING AND AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF SHY INSPECTION TO SATISFY HIMSELF THAT NO ONE IS WITHIN DRILLS A HOLE THROUGH THE SIDE
7255-291500-0013 WHEN A BUILDING IS USED AS A NESTING PLACE THE BIRD VERY CUNNINGLY DRILLS THE ENTRANCE CLOSE UP UNDER THE EAVES WHERE IT IS SHELTERED FROM STORMS AND AT THE SAME TIME OUT OF SIGHT OF ALL PRYING EYES
7255-291500-0014 ONE DAY I DROVE THE BIRDS OUT THEN CRAWLED IN UNDER A SILL ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND HID IN A CORNER OF THE LOFT WITHOUT DISTURBING ANYTHING INSIDE IT WAS A LONG WAIT IN THE STUFFY OLD PLACE BEFORE ONE OF THE BIRDS CAME BACK
7255-291500-0015 WITH THE SAME MOVEMENT AND WITHOUT PAUSING AN INSTANT HE DIVED THROUGH HEADLONG AIDED BY A SPRING FROM HIS TAIL MUCH AS A JUMPING JACK GOES OVER THE HEAD OF HIS STICK ONLY MUCH MORE RAPIDLY HARDLY HAD HE GONE BEFORE ANOTHER APPEARED TO GO THROUGH THE SAME PROGRAM
7255-291500-0016 ON A BRACKET AGAINST THE WALL WAS ANOTHER BIRD A GREAT HAWK PITCHED FORWARD ON HIS PERCH WITH WINGS WIDE SPREAD AND FIERCE EYES GLARING DOWNWARD IN THE INTENSE ATTITUDE A HAWK TAKES AS HE STRIKES HIS PREY FROM SOME LOFTY WATCH TREE THE GOLDEN WING BY THIS TIME WAS READY TO VENTURE IN
7255-291500-0017 HE HAD LEANED FORWARD WITH WINGS SPREAD
7255-291500-0018 WHAT WERE HIS IMPRESSIONS I WONDER AS HE SAT ON A LIMB OF THE OLD APPLE TREE AND THOUGHT IT ALL OVER DO BIRDS HAVE ROMANCES
7255-291500-0019 HOW MUCH GREATER WONDERS HAD HE SEEN THAN THOSE OF ANY ROMANCE AND DO THEY HAVE ANY MEANS OF COMMUNICATING THEM AS THEY SING THEIR LOVE SONGS WHAT A WONDERFUL STORY HE COULD TELL
7255-291500-0020 OF A GIANT ALL IN WHITE WITH ONLY HIS HEAD VISIBLE OF AN ENCHANTED BEAUTY STRETCHING HER WINGS IN MUTE SUPPLICATION FOR SOME BRAVE KNIGHT TO TOUCH HER AND BREAK THE SPELL WHILE ON HIGH A FIERCE DRAGON HAWK KEPT WATCH READY TO EAT UP ANY ONE WHO SHOULD DARE ENTER
