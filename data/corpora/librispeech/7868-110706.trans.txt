7868-110706-0000 THE KING OF THE GOLDEN RIVER HAD HARDLY MADE THE EXTRAORDINARY EXIT RELATED IN THE LAST CHAPTER BEFORE HANS AND SCHWARTZ CAME ROARING INTO THE HOUSE VERY SAVAGELY DRUNK THE DISCOVERY OF THE TOTAL LOSS OF THEIR LAST PIECE OF PLATE
7868-110706-0001 HAD THE EFFECT OF SOBERING THEM JUST ENOUGH TO ENABLE THEM TO STAND OVER GLUCK BEATING HIM VERY STEADILY FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AT THE EXPIRATION OF WHICH PERIOD THEY DROPPED INTO A COUPLE OF CHAIRS AND REQUESTED TO KNOW WHAT HE HAD TO SAY FOR HIMSELF
7868-110706-0002 GLUCK TOLD THEM HIS STORY OF WHICH OF COURSE THEY DID NOT BELIEVE A WORD THEY BEAT HIM AGAIN TILL THEIR ARMS WERE TIRED AND STAGGERED TO BED IN THE MORNING HOWEVER THE STEADINESS WITH WHICH HE ADHERED TO HIS STORY
7868-110706-0003 OBTAINED HIM SOME DEGREE OF CREDENCE THE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH WAS THAT THE TWO BROTHERS AFTER WRANGLING A LONG TIME ON THE KNOTTY QUESTION WHICH OF THEM SHOULD TRY HIS FORTUNE FIRST DREW THEIR SWORDS AND BEGAN FIGHTING
7868-110706-0004 AND HAVING DRUNK OUT HIS LAST PENNY THE EVENING BEFORE WAS THROWN INTO PRISON TILL HE SHOULD PAY WHEN HANS HEARD THIS HE WAS MUCH DELIGHTED
7868-110706-0005 HOW TO GET THE HOLY WATER WAS THE QUESTION HE WENT TO THE PRIEST BUT THE PRIEST COULD NOT GIVE ANY HOLY WATER TO SO ABANDONED A CHARACTER SO HANS WENT TO VESPERS IN THE EVENING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE
7868-110706-0006 AND UNDER PRETENCE OF CROSSING HIMSELF STOLE A CUPFUL AND RETURNED HOME IN TRIUMPH NEXT MORNING HE GOT UP BEFORE THE SUN ROSE PUT THE HOLY WATER INTO A STRONG FLASK AND TWO BOTTLES OF WINE AND SOME MEAT IN A BASKET
7868-110706-0007 SLUNG THEM OVER HIS BACK TOOK HIS ALPINE STAFF IN HIS HAND AND SET OFF FOR THE MOUNTAINS ON HIS WAY OUT OF THE TOWN HE HAD TO PASS THE PRISON AND AS HE LOOKED IN AT THE WINDOWS WHOM SHOULD HE SEE BUT SCHWARTZ HIMSELF PEEPING OUT OF THE BARS
7868-110706-0008 AND LOOKING VERY DISCONSOLATE GOOD MORNING BROTHER SAID HANS HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR THE KING OF THE GOLDEN RIVER
7868-110706-0009 BUT HANS ONLY LAUGHED AT HIM AND ADVISING HIM TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE TILL HE CAME BACK AGAIN SHOULDERED HIS BASKET SHOOK THE BOTTLE OF HOLY WATER IN SCHWARTZ'S FACE TILL IT FROTHED AGAIN AND MARCHED OFF IN THE HIGHEST SPIRITS IN THE WORLD
7868-110706-0010 IT WAS INDEED A MORNING THAT MIGHT HAVE MADE ANYONE HAPPY EVEN WITH NO GOLDEN RIVER TO SEEK FOR LEVEL LINES OF DEWY MIST LAY STRETCHED ALONG THE VALLEY OUT OF WHICH ROSE THE MASSY MOUNTAINS THEIR LOWER CLIFFS IN PALE GRAY SHADOW
7868-110706-0011 FAR ABOVE SHOT UP RED SPLINTERED MASSES OF CASTELLATED ROCK JAGGED AND SHIVERED INTO MYRIADS OF FANTASTIC FORMS WITH HERE AND THERE A STREAK OF SUNLIT SNOW TRACED DOWN THEIR CHASMS LIKE A LINE OF FORKED LIGHTNING
7868-110706-0012 AND FAR BEYOND AND FAR ABOVE ALL THESE FAINTER THAN THE MORNING CLOUD BUT PURER AND CHANGELESS SLEPT IN THE BLUE SKY THE UTMOST PEAKS OF THE ETERNAL SNOW THE GOLDEN RIVER
7868-110706-0013 WHICH SPRANG FROM ONE OF THE LOWER AND SNOWLESS ELEVATIONS WAS NOW NEARLY IN SHADOW ALL BUT THE UPPERMOST JETS OF SPRAY WHICH ROSE LIKE SLOW SMOKE ABOVE THE UNDULATING LINE OF THE CATARACT AND FLOATED AWAY IN FEEBLE WREATHS UPON THE MORNING WIND
7868-110706-0014 ON THIS OBJECT AND ON THIS ALONE HANS'S EYES AND THOUGHTS WERE FIXED FORGETTING THE DISTANCE HE HAD TO TRAVERSE HE SET OFF AT AN IMPRUDENT RATE OF WALKING
7868-110706-0015 WHICH GREATLY EXHAUSTED HIM BEFORE HE HAD SCALED THE FIRST RANGE OF THE GREEN AND LOW HILLS HE WAS MOREOVER SURPRISED ON SURMOUNTING THEM TO FIND THAT A LARGE GLACIER OF WHOSE EXISTENCE NOTWITHSTANDING HIS PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOUNTAINS
7868-110706-0016 HE HAD BEEN ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT LAY BETWEEN HIM AND THE SOURCE OF THE GOLDEN RIVER HE ENTERED ON IT WITH THE BOLDNESS OF A PRACTISED MOUNTAINEER
7868-110706-0017 THE ICE WAS EXCESSIVELY SLIPPERY
7868-110706-0018 NOT MONOTONOUS OR LOW BUT CHANGEFUL AND LOUD RISING OCCASIONALLY INTO DRIFTING PASSAGES OF WILD MELODY THEN BREAKING OFF INTO SHORT MELANCHOLY TONES OR SUDDEN SHRIEKS
7868-110706-0019 ABOUT ALL THEIR OUTLINES A PERPETUAL RESEMBLANCE TO LIVING FEATURES DISTORTED AND SCORNFUL MYRIADS OF DECEITFUL SHADOWS AND LURID LIGHTS PLAYED AND FLOATED ABOUT AND THROUGH THE PALE BLUE PINNACLES
7868-110706-0020 WITH THE CONSTANT GUSH AND ROAR OF THE CONCEALED WATERS THESE PAINFUL CIRCUMSTANCES INCREASED UPON HIM AS HE ADVANCED THE ICE CRASHED AND YAWNED INTO FRESH CHASMS AT HIS FEET TOTTERING SPIRES NODDED AROUND HIM
7868-110706-0021 AND FELL THUNDERING ACROSS HIS PATH AND THOUGH HE HAD REPEATEDLY FACED THESE DANGERS ON THE MOST TERRIFIC GLACIERS AND IN THE WILDEST WEATHER IT WAS WITH A NEW AND OPPRESSIVE FEELING OF PANIC TERROR THAT HE LEAPED THE LAST CHASM AND FLUNG HIMSELF
7868-110706-0022 EXHAUSTED AND SHUDDERING ON THE FIRM TURF OF THE MOUNTAIN HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO ABANDON HIS BASKET OF FOOD WHICH BECAME A PERILOUS INCUMBRANCE ON THE GLACIER
7868-110706-0023 BUT BY BREAKING OFF AND EATING SOME OF THE PIECES OF ICE THIS HOWEVER RELIEVED HIS THIRST AN HOUR'S REPOSE RECRUITED HIS HARDY FRAME AND WITH THE INDOMITABLE SPIRIT OF AVARICE HE RESUMED HIS LABORIOUS JOURNEY
7868-110706-0024 IT WAS PAST NOON AND THE RAYS BEAT INTENSELY UPON THE STEEP PATH WHILE THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE WAS MOTIONLESS AND PENETRATED WITH HEAT INTENSE THIRST WAS SOON ADDED TO THE BODILY FATIGUE WITH WHICH HANS WAS NOW AFFLICTED
7868-110706-0025 GLANCE AFTER GLANCE HE CAST ON THE FLASK OF WATER WHICH HUNG AT HIS BELT THREE DROPS ARE ENOUGH AT LAST THOUGHT HE I MAY AT LEAST COOL MY LIPS WITH IT HE OPENED THE FLASK AND WAS RAISING IT TO HIS LIPS
7868-110706-0026 WHEN HIS EYE FELL ON AN OBJECT LYING ON THE ROCK BESIDE HIM HE THOUGHT IT MOVED IT WAS A SMALL DOG APPARENTLY IN THE LAST AGONY OF DEATH FROM THIRST ITS TONGUE WAS OUT ITS JAWS DRY
7868-110706-0027 ITS LIMBS EXTENDED LIFELESSLY AND A SWARM OF BLACK ANTS WERE CRAWLING ABOUT ITS LIPS AND THROAT ITS EYE MOVED TO THE BOTTLE WHICH HANS HELD IN HIS HAND HE RAISED IT DRANK SPURNED THE ANIMAL WITH HIS FOOT AND PASSED ON
7868-110706-0028 AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW IT WAS BUT HE THOUGHT THAT A STRANGE SHADOW HAD SUDDENLY COME ACROSS THE BLUE SKY THE PATH BECAME STEEPER AND MORE RUGGED EVERY MOMENT AND THE HIGH HILL AIR INSTEAD OF REFRESHING HIM
7868-110706-0029 SEEMED TO THROW HIS BLOOD INTO A FEVER THE NOISE OF THE HILL CATARACTS SOUNDED LIKE MOCKERY IN HIS EARS THEY WERE ALL DISTANT AND HIS THIRST INCREASED EVERY MOMENT ANOTHER HOUR PASSED
7868-110706-0030 STRETCHED NEARLY LIFELESS ON THE ROCK ITS BREAST HEAVING WITH THIRST ITS EYES CLOSED AND ITS LIPS PARCHED AND BURNING HANS EYED IT DELIBERATELY DRANK AND PASSED ON
7868-110706-0031 AND LONG SNAKE LIKE SHADOWS CREPT UP ALONG THE MOUNTAIN SIDES HANS STRUGGLED ON THE SUN WAS SINKING BUT ITS DESCENT SEEMED TO BRING NO COOLNESS THE LEADEN WEIGHT OF THE DEAD AIR PRESSED UPON HIS BROW AND HEART BUT
7868-110706-0032 THE GOAL WAS NEAR HE SAW THE CATARACT OF THE GOLDEN RIVER SPRINGING FROM THE HILLSIDE SCARCELY FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE HIM HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO BREATHE AND SPRANG ON TO COMPLETE HIS TASK
7868-110706-0033 AT THIS INSTANT A FAINT CRY FELL ON HIS EAR HE TURNED AND SAW A GRAY HAIRED OLD MAN EXTENDED ON THE ROCKS HIS EYES WERE SUNK HIS FEATURES DEADLY PALE
7868-110706-0034 WATER HE STRETCHED HIS ARMS TO HANS AND CRIED FEEBLY WATER I AM DYING I HAVE NONE REPLIED HANS THOU HAST HAD THY SHARE OF LIFE HE STRODE OVER THE PROSTRATE BODY AND DARTED ON
7868-110706-0035 AND A FLASH OF BLUE LIGHTNING ROSE OUT OF THE EAST SHAPED LIKE A SWORD IT SHOOK THRICE OVER THE WHOLE HEAVEN AND LEFT IT DARK WITH ONE HEAVY IMPENETRABLE SHADE THE SUN WAS SETTING IT PLUNGED TOWARD THE HORIZON LIKE A RED HOT BALL
7868-110706-0036 THE ROAR OF THE GOLDEN RIVER ROSE ON HANS'S EAR HE STOOD AT THE BRINK OF THE CHASM THROUGH WHICH IT RAN
7868-110706-0037 THEY SHOOK THEIR CRESTS LIKE TONGUES OF FIRE AND FLASHES OF BLOODY LIGHT GLEAMED ALONG THEIR FOAM THEIR SOUND CAME MIGHTIER AND MIGHTIER ON HIS SENSES HIS BRAIN GREW GIDDY WITH THE PROLONGED THUNDER
7868-110706-0038 SHUDDERING HE DREW THE FLASK FROM HIS GIRDLE AND HURLED IT INTO THE CENTRE OF THE TORRENT AS HE DID SO AN ICY CHILL SHOT THROUGH HIS LIMBS HE STAGGERED SHRIEKED AND FELL
7868-110706-0039 THE WATERS CLOSED OVER HIS CRY AND THE MOANING OF THE RIVER ROSE WILDLY INTO THE NIGHT AS IT GUSHED OVER
