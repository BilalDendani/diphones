4192-5332-0020 HE WAS A BLUE EYED FAIR PLEASANT LOOKING YOUNG MAN SLIGHT AND OF MIDDLE HEIGHT AND QUITE AS YIELDING AND GENTLE AS HIS MOTHER IN HER THIS MILD YIELDINGNESS OF DISPOSITION WAS RATHER A GRACEFUL QUALITY IN RICHARD IT WAS REGARDED AS A CONTEMPTIBLE MISFORTUNE
4192-5332-0021 AS A LEAF WAS SWAYED BY THE WIND SO HE WAS SWAYED BY EVERYBODY ABOUT HIM NEVER POSSESSING A WILL OF HIS OWN IN SHORT RICHARD HARE THOUGH OF AN AMIABLE AND LOVING NATURE WAS NOT OVER BURDENED WITH WHAT THE WORLD CALLS BRAINS

4192-5332-0024 YES YES BUT RICHARD
4192-5332-0025 IT WAS BARBARA HERSELF WANTED YOU TO HEAR IT I THINK IT OF LITTLE MOMENT IF THE WHOLE PLACE HEARD THE TRUTH FROM ME IT WOULD DO NO GOOD FOR I SHOULD GET NO BELIEF NOT EVEN FROM YOU TRY ME RICHARD IN AS FEW WORDS AS POSSIBLE
4192-5332-0026 WELL THERE WAS A ROW AT HOME ABOUT MY GOING SO MUCH TO HALLIJOHN'S
4192-5332-0027 PERHAPS I DID AND PERHAPS I DIDN'T HALLIJOHN HAD ASKED ME TO LEND HIM MY GUN AND THAT EVENING WHEN I WENT TO SEE AF WHEN I WENT TO SEE SOME ONE NEVER MIND
4192-5332-0028 IF I AM TO JUDGE WHETHER ANYTHING CAN BE ATTEMPTED FOR YOU YOU MUST TELL IT TO ME OTHERWISE I WOULD RATHER HEAR NOTHING IT SHALL BE SACRED TRUST THEN IF I MUST I MUST RETURNED THE YIELDING RICHARD I DID LOVE THE GIRL I WOULD HAVE WAITED TILL I WAS MY OWN MASTER TO MAKE HER MY WIFE
4192-5332-0029 THOUGH IT HAD BEEN FOR YEARS AND YEARS I COULD NOT DO IT YOU KNOW IN THE FACE OF MY FATHER'S OPPOSITION YOUR WIFE REJOINED MISTER CARLYLE WITH SOME EMPHASIS RICHARD LOOKED SURPRISED WHY YOU DON'T SUPPOSE I MEANT ANYTHING ELSE
4192-5332-0030 WELL GO ON RICHARD DID SHE RETURN YOUR LOVE I CAN'T BE CERTAIN SOMETIMES I THOUGHT SHE DID SOMETIMES NOT SHE USED TO PLAY AND SHUFFLE AND SHE LIKED TOO MUCH TO BE WITH HIM I WOULD THINK HER CAPRICIOUS
4192-5332-0031 BUT I FOUND OUT THEY WERE THE EVENINGS WHEN SHE WAS EXPECTING HIM WE WERE NEVER THERE TOGETHER YOU FORGET THAT YOU HAVE NOT INDICTED HIM BY ANY NAME RICHARD I AM AT FAULT RICHARD HARE BENT FORWARD TILL HIS BLACK WHISKERS BRUSHED MISTER CARLYLE'S SHOULDER IT WAS THAT CURSED THORN
4192-5332-0032 MISTER CARLYLE REMEMBERED THE NAME BARBARA HAD MENTIONED WHO WAS THORN I NEVER HEARD OF HIM
4192-5332-0033 HE TOOK PRECIOUS GOOD CARE OF THAT HE LIVES SOME MILES AWAY AND USED TO COME OVER IN SECRET COURTING AFY YES HE DID COME COURTING HER RETURNED RICHARD IN A SAVAGE TONE DISTANCE WAS NO BARRIER HE WOULD COME GALLOPING OVER AT DUSK TIE HIS HORSE TO A TREE IN THE WOOD AND PASS AN HOUR OR TWO WITH AFY
4192-5332-0034 IN THE HOUSE WHEN HER FATHER WAS NOT AT HOME ROAMING ABOUT THE WOODS WITH HER WHEN HE WAS COME TO THE POINT RICHARD TO THE EVENING HALLIJOHN'S GUN WAS OUT OF ORDER AND HE REQUESTED THE LOAN OF MINE
4192-5332-0035 MY FATHER CALLED AFTER ME TO KNOW WHERE I WAS GOING
4192-5332-0036 AFY CAME OUT ALL RESERVE AS SHE COULD BE AT TIMES AND SAID SHE WAS UNABLE TO RECEIVE ME THEN THAT I MUST GO BACK HOME WE HAD A FEW WORDS ABOUT IT AND AS WE WERE SPEAKING LOCKSLEY PASSED
4192-5332-0037 BUT IT ENDED IN MY GIVING WAY SHE COULD DO JUST WHAT SHE LIKED WITH ME FOR I LOVED THE VERY GROUND SHE TROD ON
4192-5332-0038 AND SHE TOOK IT INDOORS SHUTTING ME OUT I DID NOT GO AWAY
4192-5332-0039 AND I HID MYSELF IN SOME TREES NEAR THE HOUSE AGAIN LOCKSLEY CAME IN VIEW AND SAW ME THERE AND CALLED OUT TO KNOW WHY I WAS HIDING I SHIED FURTHER OFF AND DID NOT ANSWER HIM WHAT WERE MY PRIVATE MOVEMENTS TO HIM AND THAT ALSO TOLD AGAINST ME AT THE INQUEST
4192-5332-0040 NOT LONG AFTERWARDS TWENTY MINUTES PERHAPS I HEARD A SHOT WHICH SEEMED TO BE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COTTAGE SOMEBODY HAVING A LATE POP AT THE PARTRIDGES THOUGHT I FOR THE SUN WAS THEN SETTING
4192-5332-0041 THAT WAS THE SHOT THAT KILLED HALLIJOHN THERE WAS A PAUSE MISTER CARLYLE LOOKED KEENLY AT RICHARD THERE IN THE MOONLIGHT
4192-5332-0042 SOME ONE CAME PANTING AND TEARING ALONG THE PATH LEADING FROM THE COTTAGE IT WAS THORN HIS APPEARANCE STARTLED ME I HAD NEVER SEEN A MAN SHOW MORE UTTER TERROR HIS FACE WAS LIVID HIS EYES SEEMED STARTING AND HIS LIPS WERE DRAWN BACK FROM HIS TEETH
4192-5332-0043 I WAS MAD WITH JEALOUSY FOR I THEN SAW THAT AFY HAD SENT ME AWAY THAT SHE MIGHT ENTERTAIN HIM I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS THORN NEVER CAME BUT AT DUSK OBSERVED MISTER CARLYLE I NEVER KNEW HIM TO DO SO UNTIL THAT EVENING ALL I CAN SAY IS HE WAS THERE THEN
4192-5332-0044 HE FLEW ALONG SWIFTLY AND I AFTERWARDS HEARD THE SOUND OF HIS HORSE'S HOOFS GALLOPING AWAY I WONDERED WHAT WAS UP THAT HE SHOULD LOOK SO SCARED AND SCUTTER AWAY AS THOUGH THE DEUCE WAS AFTER HIM I WONDERED WHETHER HE HAD QUARRELED WITH AFY
4192-5332-0045 I RAN TO THE HOUSE LEAPED UP THE TWO STEPS AND CARLYLE I FELL OVER THE PROSTRATE BODY OF HALLIJOHN HE WAS LYING JUST WITHIN ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR DEAD BLOOD WAS ROUND ABOUT HIM AND MY GUN JUST DISCHARGED WAS THROWN NEAR
4192-5332-0046 RICHARD STOPPED FOR BREATH MISTER CARLYLE DID NOT SPEAK I CALLED TO AFY NO ONE ANSWERED NO ONE WAS IN THE LOWER ROOM AND IT SEEMED THAT NO ONE WAS IN THE UPPER A SORT OF PANIC CAME OVER ME A FEAR YOU KNOW THEY ALWAYS SAID AT HOME I WAS A COWARD
4192-5332-0047 I COULD NOT HAVE REMAINED ANOTHER MINUTE WITH THAT DEAD MAN
4192-5332-0048 WHY DID YOU CATCH UP THE GUN INTERRUPTED MISTER CARLYLE IDEAS PASS THROUGH OUR MINDS QUICKER THAN WE CAN SPEAK THEM ESPECIALLY IN THESE SORTS OF MOMENTS WAS THE REPLY OF RICHARD HARE SOME VAGUE NOTION FLASHED ON MY BRAIN THAT MY GUN
4192-5332-0049 OUGHT NOT TO BE FOUND NEAR THE MURDERED BODY OF HALLIJOHN I WAS FLYING FROM THE DOOR I SAY WHEN LOCKSLEY EMERGED FROM THE WOOD FULL IN VIEW AND WHAT POSSESSED ME I CAN'T TELL BUT I DID THE WORST THING I COULD DO
4192-5332-0050 FLUNG THE GUN INDOORS AGAIN AND GOT AWAY ALTHOUGH LOCKSLEY CALLED AFTER ME TO STOP NOTHING TOLD AGAINST YOU SO MUCH AS THAT OBSERVED MISTER CARLYLE LOCKSLEY DEPOSED THAT HE HAD SEEN YOU LEAVE THE COTTAGE GUN IN HAND APPARENTLY IN GREAT COMMOTION
4192-5332-0051 THAT THE MOMENT YOU SAW HIM YOU HESITATED AS FROM FEAR FLUNG BACK THE GUN AND ESCAPED RICHARD STAMPED HIS FOOT AYE AND ALL OWING TO MY CURSED COWARDICE
4192-5332-0052 NOW I KNEW THAT BETHEL
4192-5332-0053 MUST HAVE MET THORN QUITTING IT DID YOU ENCOUNTER THAT HOUND I ASKED HIM WHAT HOUND RETURNED BETHEL THAT FINE FELLOW THAT THORN WHO COMES AFTER AFY I ANSWERED FOR I DID NOT MIND MENTIONING HER NAME IN MY PASSION
4192-5332-0054 DID YOU HEAR A SHOT I WENT ON YES I DID HE REPLIED
4192-5332-0055 I QUITTED HIM AND CAME OFF CONCLUDED RICHARD HARE HE EVIDENTLY HAD NOT SEEN THORN AND KNEW NOTHING
4192-5332-0056 IT WAS A FATAL STEP YES I WAS A FOOL I THOUGHT I'D WAIT QUIET AND SEE HOW THINGS TURNED OUT BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ALL
4192-5332-0057 ACCUSING ME OF BEING THE MURDERER OF HER FATHER AND SHE FELL INTO HYSTERICS OUT THERE ON THE GRASS THE NOISE BROUGHT PEOPLE FROM THE HOUSE PLENTY WERE IN IT THEN AND I RETREATED IF SHE CAN THINK ME GUILTY THE WORLD WILL THINK ME GUILTY WAS MY ARGUMENT
4192-5332-0058 AND THAT NIGHT I WENT RIGHT OFF TO STOP IN HIDING FOR A DAY OR TWO TILL I SAW MY WAY CLEAR IT NEVER CAME CLEAR THE CORONER'S INQUEST SAT AND THE VERDICT FLOORED ME OVER AND AFY BUT I WON'T CURSE HER FANNED THE FLAME AGAINST ME BY DENYING THAT ANY ONE HAD BEEN THERE THAT NIGHT
4192-5332-0059 TO THE PATH THAT LED FROM WEST LYNNE AND WAS LINGERING THERE WHEN SHE HEARD A SHOT
4192-5332-0060 MISTER CARLYLE REMAINED SILENT RAPIDLY RUNNING OVER IN HIS MIND THE CHIEF POINTS OF RICHARD HARE'S COMMUNICATION FOUR OF YOU AS I UNDERSTAND IT WERE IN THE VICINITY OF THE COTTAGE THAT NIGHT AND FROM ONE OR THE OTHER THE SHOT NO DOUBT PROCEEDED YOU WERE AT A DISTANCE YOU SAY RICHARD
4192-5332-0061 BETHEL ALSO COULD NOT HAVE BEEN IT WAS NOT BETHEL WHO DID IT INTERRUPTED RICHARD
4192-5332-0062 BUT NOW WHERE WAS LOCKSLEY
4192-5332-0063 HE WAS WITHIN MY VIEW AT THE SAME TIME AT RIGHT ANGLES FROM ME DEEP IN THE WOOD AWAY FROM THE PATHS ALTOGETHER IT WAS THORN DID THE DEED BEYOND ALL DOUBT
4192-5332-0064 CARLYLE I SEE YOU DON'T BELIEVE MY STORY
4192-5332-0065 THE MOST SINGULAR THING IS IF YOU WITNESSED THIS THORN'S RUNNING FROM THE COTTAGE IN THE MANNER YOU DESCRIBE THAT YOU DID NOT COME FORWARD AND DENOUNCE HIM
4192-5332-0066 I CAN'T HELP IT IT WAS BORN WITH ME AND WILL GO WITH ME TO MY GRAVE WHAT WOULD MY WORD HAVE AVAILED THAT IT WAS THORN WHEN THERE WAS NOBODY TO CORROBORATE IT AND THE DISCHARGED GUN MINE WAS A DAMNATORY PROOF AGAINST ME
4192-5332-0067 ANOTHER THING STRIKES ME AS CURIOUS CRIED MISTER CARLYLE IF THIS MAN THORN WAS IN THE HABIT OF COMING TO WEST LYNNE EVENING AFTER EVENING HOW WAS IT THAT HE NEVER WAS OBSERVED THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HEARD ANY STRANGER'S NAME MENTIONED IN CONNECTION WITH THE AFFAIR OR WITH AFY
4192-5332-0068 THORN CHOSE BY ROADS AND HE NEVER CAME SAVE THAT ONCE BUT AT DUSK AND DARK IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS STRIVING TO DO IT ON THE SECRET I TOLD AFY SO
4192-5332-0069 NEVERTHELESS I SWEAR THAT I HAVE RELATED THE FACTS AS SURELY AS THAT WE I THORN AFY AND HALLIJOHN MUST ONE DAY MEET TOGETHER BEFORE OUR MAKER I HAVE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH
4192-5332-0070 TO WHAT END ELSE SHOULD I SAY THIS WENT ON RICHARD IT CAN DO ME NO SERVICE ALL THE ASSERTION I COULD PUT FORTH WOULD NOT GO A JOT TOWARD CLEARING ME NO IT WOULD NOT ASSENTED MISTER CARLYLE IF EVER YOU ARE CLEARED IT MUST BE BY PROOFS BUT
4192-5332-0071 I WILL KEEP MY THOUGHT ON THE MATTER AND SHOULD ANYTHING ARISE WHAT SORT OF A MAN WAS THIS THORN
4192-5332-0072 TALL AND SLENDER AN OUT AND OUT ARISTOCRAT AND HIS CONNECTIONS WHERE DID HE LIVE I NEVER KNEW AFY IN HER BOASTING WAY WOULD SAY HE HAD COME FROM SWAINSON A TEN MILE RIDE FROM SWAINSON QUICKLY INTERRUPTED MISTER CARLYLE
4192-5332-0073 COULD IT BE ONE OF THE THORNS OF SWAINSON NONE OF THE THORNS THAT I KNOW HE WAS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SORT OF MAN WITH HIS PERFUMED HANDS AND HIS RINGS AND HIS DAINTY GLOVES THAT HE WAS AN ARISTOCRAT I BELIEVE BUT OF BAD TASTE AND STYLE
4192-5332-0074 DISPLAYING A PROFUSION OF JEWELLERY A HALF SMILE FLITTED OVER CARLYLE'S FACE WAS IT REAL RICHARD IT WAS HE WOULD WEAR DIAMOND SHIRT STUDS DIAMOND RINGS DIAMOND PINS BRILLIANTS
4192-5332-0075 MY IMPRESSION WAS THAT HE PUT THEM ON TO DAZZLE AFY SHE TOLD ME ONCE THAT SHE COULD BE A GRANDER LADY IF SHE CHOSE THAN I COULD EVER MAKE HER A LADY ON THE CROSS I ANSWERED BUT NEVER ON THE SQUARE
4192-5332-0076 BUT GIRLS ARE SIMPLE AS GEESE BY YOUR DESCRIPTION IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE THORNS OF SWAINSON WEALTHY TRADESMEN FATHERS OF YOUNG FAMILIES SHORT STOUT AND HEAVY AS DUTCHMEN STAID AND MOST RESPECTABLE
4192-5332-0077 VERY UNLIKELY MEN ARE THEY TO RUN INTO AN EXPEDITION OF THAT SORT WHAT EXPEDITION QUESTIONED RICHARD THE MURDER THE RIDING AFTER AFY RICHARD WHERE IS AFY RICHARD HARE LIFTED HIS EYES IN SURPRISE
4192-5332-0078 HOW SHOULD I KNOW I WAS JUST GOING TO ASK YOU MISTER CARLYLE PAUSED HE THOUGHT RICHARD'S ANSWER AN EVASIVE ONE SHE DISAPPEARED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FUNERAL AND IT WAS THOUGHT IN SHORT RICHARD THE NEIGHBORHOOD GAVE HER CREDIT FOR HAVING GONE AFTER AND JOINED YOU
4192-5332-0079 NO DID THEY WHAT A PACK OF IDIOTS I HAVE NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF HER CARLYLE SINCE THAT UNFORTUNATE NIGHT IF SHE WENT AFTER ANYBODY IT WAS AFTER THORN WAS THE MAN GOOD LOOKING I SUPPOSE THE WORLD WOULD CALL HIM SO
4192-5332-0080 AFY THOUGHT SUCH AN ADONIS HAD NEVER BEEN COINED OUT OF FABLE HE HAD SHINY BLACK HAIR AND WHISKERS DARK EYES AND HANDSOME FEATURES BUT HIS VAIN DANDYISM SPOILT HIM WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT HIS HANDKERCHIEFS WERE SOAKED IN SCENT
4192-5332-0081 SILKY AS A HAIR AS FINE AS THE ONE BARBARA BOUGHT AT LYNNEBOROUGH AND GAVE A GUINEA FOR
4192-5332-0082 MISTER CARLYLE COULD ASCERTAIN NO MORE PARTICULARS AND IT WAS TIME RICHARD WENT INDOORS THEY PROCEEDED UP THE PATH WHAT A BLESSING IT IS THE SERVANTS WINDOWS DON'T LOOK THIS WAY SHIVERED RICHARD TREADING ON MISTER CARLYLE'S HEELS
4192-5332-0083 IF THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT UPSTAIRS HIS APPREHENSIONS WERE GROUNDLESS AND HE ENTERED UNSEEN MISTER CARLYLE'S PART WAS OVER HE LEFT THE POOR BANNED EXILE TO HIS SHORT INTERVIEW WITH HIS HYSTERICAL AND TEARFUL MOTHER RICHARD NEARLY AS HYSTERICAL AS SHE
4192-5332-0084 AND MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY HOME AGAIN PONDERING OVER WHAT HE HAD HEARD THE MAGISTRATES MADE A GOOD EVENING OF IT MISTER CARLYLE ENTERTAINED THEM TO SUPPER MUTTON CHOPS AND BREAD AND CHEESE THEY TOOK UP THEIR PIPES FOR ANOTHER WHIFF WHEN THE MEAL WAS OVER
4192-5332-0085 BUT MISS CARLYLE RETIRED TO BED THE SMOKE TO WHICH SHE HAD NOT BEEN ACCUSTOMED SINCE HER FATHER'S DEATH HAD MADE HER HEAD ACHE AND HER EYES SMART ABOUT ELEVEN THEY WISHED MISTER CARLYLE GOOD NIGHT AND DEPARTED BUT MISTER DILL IN OBEDIENCE TO A NOD FROM HIS SUPERIOR REMAINED
4192-5332-0086 SIT DOWN A MOMENT DILL I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION YOU ARE INTIMATE WITH THE THORNS OF SWAINSON DO THEY HAPPEN TO HAVE ANY RELATIVE A NEPHEW OR COUSIN PERHAPS A DANDY YOUNG FELLOW I WENT OVER LAST SUNDAY FORTNIGHT TO SPEND THE DAY WITH YOUNG JACOB WAS THE ANSWER OF MISTER DILL
4192-5332-0087 ONE WIDER FROM THE POINT THAN HE GENERALLY GAVE MISTER CARLYLE SMILED YOUNG JACOB HE MUST BE FORTY I SUPPOSE
4192-5332-0088 THEY HAVE NO NEPHEW THE OLD MAN NEVER HAD BUT THOSE TWO CHILDREN JACOB AND EDWARD NEITHER HAVE THEY ANY COUSIN RICH MEN THEY ARE GROWING NOW JACOB HAS SET UP HIS CARRIAGE
4192-5332-0089 TANNERS CURRIERS AND LEATHER DRESSERS POSSESSING A RELATIVE OF THE NAME DILL SAID HE SOMETHING HAS ARISEN WHICH IN MY MIND CASTS A DOUBT UPON RICHARD HARE'S GUILT I QUESTION WHETHER HE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MURDER
4192-5332-0090 SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES I GRANT STILL I HAVE GOOD CAUSE TO DOUBT AT THE TIME IT HAPPENED SOME DANDY FELLOW USED TO COME COURTING AFY HALLIJOHN IN SECRET A TALL SLENDER MAN AS HE IS DESCRIBED TO ME BEARING THE NAME OF THORN AND LIVING AT SWAINSON
4192-5332-0091 MISTER ARCHIBALD REMONSTRATED THE OLD CLERK AS IF THOSE TWO RESPECTED GENTLEMEN WITH THEIR WIVES AND BABIES WOULD COME SNEAKING AFTER THAT FLYAWAY AFY NO REFLECTION ON THEM RETURNED MISTER CARLYLE THIS WAS A YOUNG MAN THREE OR FOUR AND TWENTY A HEAD TALLER THAN EITHER
4192-5332-0092 I HAVE REPEATEDLY HEARD THEM SAY THAT THEY ARE ALONE IN THE WORLD THAT THEY ARE THE TWO LAST OF THE NAME DEPEND UPON IT IT WAS NOBODY CONNECTED WITH THEM AND WISHING MISTER CARLYLE GOOD NIGHT HE DEPARTED
4192-5332-0093 MISTER CARLYLE SAT IN A BROWN STUDY
4192-5332-0094 IS JOYCE GONE TO BED NO SIR SHE IS JUST GOING
4192-5332-0095 JOYCE CAME IN THE UPPER SERVANT AT MISS CARLYLE'S SHE WAS OF MIDDLE HEIGHT AND WOULD NEVER SEE FIVE AND THIRTY AGAIN HER FOREHEAD WAS BROAD HER GRAY EYES WERE DEEPLY SET AND HER FACE WAS PALE ALTOGETHER SHE WAS PLAIN BUT SENSIBLE LOOKING
4192-5332-0096 SHE WAS THE HALF SISTER OF AFY HALLIJOHN SHUT THE DOOR JOYCE JOYCE DID AS SHE WAS BID CAME FORWARD AND STOOD BY THE TABLE HAVE YOU EVER HEARD FROM YOUR SISTER JOYCE BEGAN MISTER CARLYLE SOMEWHAT ABRUPTLY NO SIR WAS THE REPLY
4192-5332-0097 I THINK IT WOULD BE A WONDER IF I DID HEAR WHY SO IF SHE WOULD GO OFF AFTER RICHARD HARE WHO HAD SENT HER FATHER INTO HIS GRAVE
4192-5332-0098 WHO WAS THAT OTHER THAT FINE GENTLEMAN WHO CAME AFTER HER THE COLOR MANTLED IN JOYCE'S CHEEKS AND SHE DROPPED HER VOICE SIR DID YOU HEAR OF HIM NOT AT THAT TIME SINCE HE CAME FROM SWAINSON DID HE NOT
4192-5332-0099 I BELIEVE SO SIR AFY NEVER WOULD SAY MUCH ABOUT HIM WE DID NOT AGREE UPON THE POINT I SAID A PERSON OF HIS RANK WOULD DO HER NO GOOD
4192-5332-0100 MISTER CARLYLE CAUGHT HER UP HIS RANK WHAT WAS HIS RANK
4192-5332-0101 AND HE LOOKED LIKE IT I ONLY SAW HIM ONCE
4192-5332-0102 HIS WHITE HANDS WERE ALL GLITTERING WITH RINGS
4192-5332-0103 HAVE YOU SEEN HIM SINCE NEVER SINCE NEVER BUT ONCE AND I DON'T THINK I SHOULD KNOW HIM IF I DID SEE HIM
4192-5332-0104 SHOOK HANDS WITH AFY AND LEFT A FINE UPRIGHT MAN HE WAS NEARLY AS TALL AS YOU SIR BUT VERY SLIM THOSE SOLDIERS ALWAYS CARRY THEMSELVES WELL HOW DO YOU KNOW HE WAS A SOLDIER QUICKLY REJOINED MISTER CARLYLE AFY TOLD ME SO
4192-5332-0105 THE CAPTAIN SHE USED TO CALL HIM BUT SHE SAID HE WAS NOT A CAPTAIN YET AWHILE THE NEXT GRADE TO IT A A LIEUTENANT SUGGESTED MISTER CARLYLE YES SIR THAT WAS IT LIEUTENANT THORN JOYCE SAID MISTER CARLYLE
4192-5332-0106 NO SIR ANSWERED JOYCE
4192-5332-0107 AND NOTHING CAN TURN ME FROM THE BELIEF ALL WEST LYNNE IS CONVINCED OF IT MISTER CARLYLE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO TURN HER FROM HER BELIEF HE DISMISSED HER AND SAT ON STILL REVOLVING THE CASE IN ALL ITS BEARINGS
4192-5332-0108 RICHARD HARE'S SHORT INTERVIEW WITH HIS MOTHER HAD SOON TERMINATED IT LASTED BUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BOTH DREADING INTERRUPTIONS FROM THE SERVANTS AND WITH A HUNDRED POUNDS IN HIS POCKET AND DESOLATION IN HIS HEART THE ILL FATED YOUNG MAN ONCE MORE QUITTED HIS CHILDHOOD'S HOME
