7437-99249-0000 AND LEARN NOT ONLY WHAT HE THEN WAS BUT HOW HE HAD BECOME THAT WHICH HE WAS HAPPILY IT NEEDS NO LONG HISTORICAL DETAILS OR WEARISOME DISCUSSION OF REMOTE OR DOUBTFUL CAUSES TO GAIN THIS NECESSARY KNOWLEDGE
7437-99249-0001 FROM THAT DATE DOWN TO THE PRESENT TIME WE HAVE A CONTINUOUS RECORD THE WHOLE COURSE OF WHICH MAY BE DIVIDED INTO THREE CLEARLY DISTINGUISHED PERIODS OF THESE THE FIRST WAS NOT ONLY BY FAR THE LONGEST BUT IN EVERY WAY THE MOST BRILLIANT
7437-99249-0002 IN IT EGYPT WAS AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY WITH A SOCIAL SYSTEM OF AN ADVANCED TYPE THE SPONTANEOUS PRODUCT OF THE GENIUS OF THE PEOPLE AND IT WAS THE ONE IN WHICH UNDER NATIVE RULERS THE LAND WAS FILLED WITH THE MARVELLOUS PYRAMIDS TEMPLES
7437-99249-0003 WITH THE CONQUEST OF THE COUNTRY BY CAMBYSES
7437-99249-0004 EGYPT WAS FOR A LITTLE MORE THAN THREE AND HALF CENTURIES IN THE HANDS OF THE GREEKS FROM WHOM IN THE THIRTIETH YEAR OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA IT PASSED TO THE ROMAN EMPIRE
7437-99249-0005 WERE IN THEIR TURN SUCCEEDED BY THEIR REVOLTING SLAVES UNDER WHOM AS THE MAMELUK SULTANS IT REMAINED UNTIL IN FIFTEEN SEVENTEEN IT BECAME A PROVINCE OF THE TURKISH EMPIRE
7437-99249-0006 AND ARE THEREFORE MONUMENTS NOT OF THE COUNTRY'S GLORY BUT OF ITS SHAME THE THIRD AND PRESENT PERIOD BEGAN IN SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT WHEN THE LANDING OF BONAPARTE WAS THE FIRST OF THE SERIES OF EVENTS
7437-99249-0007 HAS BEEN LIFTED FROM AN APPALLING CONDITION OF SOCIAL AND COMMERCIAL DESTITUTION PRODUCED BY THE RUINOUS MISGOVERNMENT AND RECKLESS TYRANNY OF A DOMINANT CLASS TO ONE OF UNEXAMPLED PROSPERITY AND OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FREEDOM NOT EXCEEDED IN ANY COUNTRY OF THE WORLD
7437-99249-0008 WHEREVER WE GO IN THE NILE VALLEY OR IN THE DELTA WE MEET WITH MEN AND WOMEN WHOSE FACES AND FEATURES ARE LIVING REPRODUCTIONS OF THE PORTRAITS OF THE KINGS AND PEOPLE OF THE MOST ANCIENT TIMES AS SCULPTURED BY THE ARTISTS OF THEIR DAYS
7437-99249-0009 AND IN THEIR HABITS MANNERS AND CUSTOMS WE FIND TO DAY STRIKING TRACES OF THOSE THAT SEEM TO HAVE PREVAILED WHEN FOUR THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE CHRIST
7437-99249-0010 NOW BELIEVED TO BE THE OLDEST BOOK IN THE WORLD AND FROM THEIR BUILDING IN THOSE FAR OFF AGES DOWN TO THE PRESENT DAY THE PYRAMIDS TEMPLES AND TOMBS HAVE STOOD SURVIVING WITNESSES OF THE EARLY GREATNESS OF THE COUNTRY AND THOUGH BUT HEEDLESS SPECTATORS OF ITS VICISSITUDES
7437-99249-0011 PERSIANS GREEKS ROMANS ARABS TURKS ALL THESE HAVE HELD THE PEOPLE IN BONDAGE BUT THEIR INFLUENCE NEVER REACHED BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE LIFE OF THE COUNTRY AND HAS VANISHED COMPLETELY WITH THE MEN UPON WHOM IT DEPENDED AND THOUGH SOME OF THESE HAVE LEFT MONUMENTS ALL BUT IMPERISHABLE OF THEIR GREATNESS AND GLORY
7437-99249-0012 ARE INDEED ALL THAT THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY PRESENTS TO US AS STILL CLEARLY AND PROMINENTLY EXERTING AN IMPORTANT AND PERMANENT INFLUENCE UPON BOTH THE CHARACTER OF THE PEOPLE AND THE EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONDITION OF THEIR COUNTRY OF THESE SIX EVENTS
7437-99249-0013 THE TWO THAT BELONG TO THE SECOND PERIOD ARE THE CONQUEST OF THE LAND BY THE ARABS AND ITS SUBSEQUENT SEIZURE BY THE TURKS THE OTHER FOUR ARE THE FRENCH INVASION
7437-99249-0014 EACH AND ALL OF THESE SIX EVENTS HAVE PLAYED IMPORTANT PARTS IN MOULDING THE PRESENT DAY ASPECT OF EGYPT AND ITS PEOPLE
7437-99249-0015 AND THE MORE CLOSELY DO WE STUDY THE EXISTING CONDITIONS THE MORE STRIKINGLY DO THESE SIX EVENTS STAND OUT FROM ALL OTHERS AS THE GREAT AND DOMINATING LANDMARKS IN THE HISTORY OF MODERN EGYPT COMPARED WITH THESE ALL THE OTHER INCIDENTS OF THAT STORY OF SEVENTY CENTURIES
7437-99249-0016 EITHER TO UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY OR TO FORECAST ITS FUTURE ALTHOUGH THEREFORE THE THIRD OF THESE LANDMARKS FORMS AS WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN
7437-99249-0017 IN OTHER WORDS ITS HISTORY AS HISTORY IS COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD AND WRITTEN THE RECORD OF THE RISE AND FALL OF ITS RULERS THE TALE OF THEIR TRIUMPH AND OF THEIR FAILURES AND CHRONICLE OF THEIR WARS VICTORIES DEFEATS AND ALL THE EVENTS THAT HAVE MADE OR MARRED THEIR DESTINIES THE OTHER THE STORY OF THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES
7437-99249-0018 IN THE HISTORY OF SOME COUNTRIES THE TWO STORIES IF RIGHTLY TOLD ARE SO INTERWOVEN THAT THEY BECOME AS ONE BUT IN THE FIRST AND SECOND PERIODS OF EGYPTIAN HISTORY THEY HAVE SCARCE ANYTHING IN COMMON
7437-99249-0019 BUT SUCH CHANGES WERE FAR TOO SLIGHT AND THEIR POSSIBLE DURATION ALWAYS FAR TOO UNCERTAIN FOR THESE BENEFITS TO BE MORE TO THE PEOPLE THAN AS THE GRATEFUL BUT PASSING PLEASURE A FLEETING MORNING CLOUD BRINGS TO THE TRAVELLER IN A SUNBURNT DESERT HENCE SUCH AS THE FELLAHEEN OR PEASANTRY WERE
7437-99249-0020 THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY HAS THEREFORE IN THE FIRST TWO PERIODS LITTLE TO SAY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE MODERN PERIOD THE TWO STORIES TOUCH EACH OTHER MORE CLOSELY FOR IN IT THE PEOPLE HAVE BEGUN TO HAVE A POLITICAL EXISTENCE
7437-99249-0021 THEY HAVE NOT INDEED A REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT AND SO THEY HAVE NO DIRECT POWER BUT THEY HAVE A PRESS THE FREEDOM OF WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY UNRESTRICTED AND THEY HAVE A LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL AS A BODY OF ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES
7437-99249-0022 THROUGH WHOM THOUGH THEY CANNOT CONTROL THE ACTION OF THE GOVERNMENT THEY ARE AT LEAST ABLE TO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD AND THEIR WISHES KNOWN MORE IMPORTANT STILL THEY HAVE BEGUN TO COMPREHEND THE RIGHT OF A PEOPLE TO BE GOVERNED NOT ONLY JUSTLY BUT WITH
7437-99249-0023 A REGARD TO THEIR INTERESTS AS WELL AS TO THOSE OF THEIR RULERS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE THAT IN THE PAST WOULD HAVE BEEN DEEMED AN UNPARDONABLE HERESY
7437-99249-0024 THOUGH ONE FOR LONG WHOLLY UNPRODUCTIVE OF ANY POLITICAL BENEFIT TO THE PEOPLE WAS THE ARAB CONQUEST WHICH BY THE RESULTING CONVERSION OF ALMOST THE WHOLE POPULATION TO THE MAHOMEDAN RELIGION BROUGHT ABOUT A CHANGE STILL FRUITFUL IN ITS INFLUENCE UPON THEIR IDEALS AND ASPIRATIONS
7437-99249-0025 TO FULLY DESCRIBE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS EVENT IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO ENLARGE UPON THE CHARACTER AND TENDENCY OF THE MAHOMEDAN RELIGION AT A LENGTH MY LIMITS FORBID AND I MUST HERE THEREFORE CONTENT MYSELF WITH NOTING THAT
7437-99249-0026 GREAT AS WAS THE MORAL AND MENTAL REVOLUTION THIS CONVERSION OCCASIONED IT WAS BY NO MEANS COMMENSURATE WITH THAT WHICH FOLLOWED THE INTRODUCTION OF ISLAM INTO OTHER COUNTRIES ON THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF THE PEOPLE IT SEEMS INDEED TO HAVE HAD BUT LITTLE EFFECT OTHER THAN THAT OF ALTERING THEIR MORAL STANDARD
7437-99249-0027 AND STILL GIVES IT SUCH VITALITY AS IT CONTINUES TO POSSESS CHRISTIANITY HAD BEEN FOR A LONG TIME THE STATE RELIGION OF THE COUNTRY BUT IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WERE NEVER MORE THAN MERE NOMINAL FOLLOWERS OF THE CROSS
7437-99249-0028 AND SUFFER LESS FROM THE RAPACIOUS TYRANNY AND HEARTLESS CRUELTY OF THOSE NEVER RESTING OPPRESSORS HIS RULERS AND ALL WHO AS OFFICIALS OR FAVOURITES WERE LIFTED EVEN A LITTLE ABOVE HIS OWN LEVEL IT WAS AND IS OF THE ESSENCE OF ISLAM
7437-99249-0029 A NOBLER CONCEPTION OF LIFE AND OF ITS DUTIES AND A STRONGER FAITH IN A HEREAFTER THAT SHOULD COMPENSATE HIM FOR ALL HIS SUFFERINGS AND PRIVATIONS IN THIS LIFE AS AN INDIVIDUAL THEREFORE HE WAS SOMEWHAT ALTERED BUT AS A MEMBER OF THE STATE
7437-99249-0030 IF WE MAY APPLY THAT TERM TO ONE WHO HAD NO POLITICAL EXISTENCE SAVE THAT INVOLVED IN YIELDING TO HIS RULERS THE UTMOST PENNYWORTH OF VALUE THEY COULD WREST FROM HIM BY TYRANNY AND CRUELTY HE WAS THE SAME HELPLESS HOPELESS DOWNTRODDEN BEING LESS VALUED AND LESS CARED FOR THAN THE BEASTS IN HIS FIELDS
7437-99249-0031 IF SOCIALLY AND OTHERWISE THE EGYPTIANS PROFITED BUT LITTLE FROM THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CALIPHATE THEY GAINED STILL LESS FROM THE DOMINATION OF THE TURKS TO THE PEOPLE INDEED THIS CHANGE WAS SCARCELY MORE THAN A MERE NOMINAL ONE IT LEFT THEM PRACTICALLY UNDER THE SAME RULERS
7437-99249-0032 FOR THOUGH THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT WAS MODIFIED IT PLACED THE EXECUTIVE POWER IF NOT IN THE HANDS OF THE SAME MEN AS BEFORE AT LEAST IN THOSE OF MEN OF THE SAME STAMP WHO RULED THEM AS THEIR PREDECESSORS HAD DONE IN THE SAME MANNER THROUGH THE SAME AGENTS AND WITH THE SAME CRUELTY AND WANTON OPPRESSION
7437-99249-0033 THE INFLUENCE OF WHICH TIME HAS STRENGTHENED SO THAT IT IS ONLY SECOND TO THAT IN THE URGENCY OF ITS BEARING UPON EXISTING CONDITIONS UNDER THE ARABS THE EGYPTIANS HAD BEEN RULED BY FOREIGNERS BUT BY FOREIGNERS WHO WERE IN SOME DEGREE ALLIED TO THEM
7437-99249-0034 UNDER THE TURKS THEIR SOVEREIGN WAS AND IS NOT ONLY A FOREIGNER BUT ONE OF AN UTTERLY ALIEN RACE WHOLLY SEPARATED FROM THEM BY LANGUAGE CHARACTER HABITS BY EVERYTHING INDEED SAVE THE BOND OF THEIR COMMON RELIGION
7437-99249-0035 THEIR LOYALTY TO HIM IS LARGELY DUE TO THE DESIRE OF PEOPLES WHO HAVE LOST THE PLACE THEY ONCE HELD IN THE COMITY OF NATIONS TO ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH SUCH KINDRED PEOPLES AS HAVE IN SOME EXTENT MAINTAINED THEIR ANCIENT STATUS
7437-99249-0036 WITHIN THE ONLY RADIANCE THEY CAN CLAIM TO SHARE WHILE THEREFORE THE LOYALTY OF THE EGYPTIANS TO THE TURKISH EMPIRE IS ONLY A PART OF THEIR LOYALTY TO THEIR RELIGION IT HAS THIS FROM THE POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE THAT IT IS NOT IRREVOCABLE
7437-99249-0037 BUT MORE OR LESS DEPENDENT UPON THE SULTAN MAINTAINING HIS POLITICAL SUPREMACY IN THE MAHOMEDAN WORLD FOR SHOULD HE LOSE THE POSITION HE HOLDS AS THE MOST POWERFUL RULER IN ISLAM NOT ONLY THE EGYPTIANS
7437-99249-0038 IT WOULD ENTIRELY DEPEND UPON CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO FORESEE WHETHER THE EGYPTIANS WOULD OR WOULD NOT REMAIN FAITHFUL TO THE EMPIRE
7437-99249-0039 SUCH THEN ARE THE LINKS THAT BIND THE EGYPT OF THE PRESENT DAY TO THE EGYPT OF THE PAST BUT IMPORTANT AS HAS BEEN AND IS THE PART THAT THE ARAB AND TURKISH CONQUESTS HAVE PLAYED IN SHAPING THE PRESENT AND WILL YET HAVE IN MOULDING THE FUTURE OF THE PEOPLE
7437-99249-0040 IT WAS NOT TO THESE EVENTS BUT TO OTHERS OCCURRING OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY THAT WE OWE THE INAUGURATION OF THE MODERN PERIOD OF EGYPTIAN HISTORY
