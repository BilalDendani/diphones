3098-5408-0000 CHAPTER THREE THE GALE THE WIND SEEMS TO BE HAULING SAID THE MATE WALKING AFT AND ADDRESSING HIS SUPERIOR KEEP HER A GOOD FULL SAID THE CAPTAIN TO THE MAN AT THE HELM AY AY SIR SAID THE OLD TAR
3098-5408-0001 AS HE TRIED TO MAKE THE SAILS DRAW BY ALTERING THE VESSEL'S COURSE A POINT OR TWO MORE FREE HERE IT IS SURE ENOUGH SAID THE CAPTAIN FROM THE SOUTHWEST UP WITH THE MEN FORWARD ONCE MORE MISTER FAULKNER WE MUST HUMOR OUR BEAUTY
3098-5408-0002 ALL HANDS OIL DECK SHOUTED THE MATE AT THE HATCH AN ORDER WHICH AS BEFORE WAS PERFECTLY OBEYED ALMOST AS QUICKLY AS THE FOREMAST HAD BEEN STRIPPED OF THE SQUARE RIG IT HAD AT FIRST BORNE IT WAS ONCE MORE CLOTHED AGAIN WITH ITS TOPSAIL AND MAINSAIL
3098-5408-0003 AND IN LESS THAN FIFTEEN MINUTES THE SEA WITCH WAS UNDER A CLOUD OF CANVASS WITH STUDD'NSAILS OUT ON BOTH SIDES WHILE THE FORE AND AFT SAILS ON THE MAIN AND MIZZEN WERE BOOMED OUT WING AND WING DEAD BEFORE THE WIND THE STAYSAILS AND JIBS WERE HAULED DOWN NOW AS USELESS
3098-5408-0004 AND THE VESSEL FLEW LIKE A COURSER THE CHANGE OF WIND HAD BROUGHT THE SEA UP AND THE VESSEL HAD A GRADUAL ROLL CAUSING THE WAVES NOW AND THEN TO COME GRACEFULLY IN OVER THE WAIST WHILE THE EXTREME FORE AND AFT PARTS OF THE HANDSOME CRAFT
3098-5408-0005 WERE PERFECTLY DRY IT HAS SET HER TO WALTZING MISTER FAULKNER SAID HIS SUPERIOR BUT SHE IMPROVES HER SPEED UPON TO IT AND I THINK THE BREEZE FRESHENS FROM THIS NEW QUARTER YES SIR DO YOU SEE THE LONG BANK OF WHITE HEREAWAY TO THE SOUTH SOUTHWEST
3098-5408-0006 IT LOOKS LIKE A FOG BANK BUT MAY BE A SQUALL SAID THE MATE THERE ARE FEW SQUALLS IN THESE LATITUDES MISTER FAULKNER AND YET I DON'T LIKE THE LOOKS OF THE WEATHER IN THE SOUTHERN BOARD SAID THE CAPTAIN AS HE GAZED TO WINDWARD
3098-5408-0007 AND NOW AND THEN A DAMP PUFF AND LULL THAT WERE TOO SIGNIFICANT TOKENS FOR A SEAMAN TO DISREGARD CAPTAIN RATLIN JUMPED UPON THE INNER BRACES OF THE TAFFRAIL AND SHADING HIS EYES WITH HIS HANDS FOR A MOMENT LOOKED STEADILY TO WINDWARD
3098-5408-0008 THEN GLANCED AT HIS WELL FILLED SAILS AS THOUGH HE WAS LOTH TO LOSE EVEN A MINUTE OF SUCH A FAIR WIND HE DELAYED HOWEVER BUT A SECOND WHEN JUMPING DOWN TO THE DECK AGAIN HE ISSUED HIS ORDERS IN THOSE BRIEF BUT SIGNIFICANT TONES OF VOICE
3098-5408-0009 WHICH AT THE SAME TIME IMPARTS PROMPTNESS AND CONFIDENCE IN A WAITING CREW ON SHIPBOARD IN STUDD'NSAILS GAFF TOPSAILS FORE ROYAL AND TOP GALLANTSAILS WITH A WILL MEN CHEERILY CHEERILY O
3098-5408-0010 THESE WERE TONES THAT THE CREW OF THE SEA WITCH WERE NO STRANGERS TO AND SOUNDS THEY LOVED FOR THEY BETOKENED A THOROUGH AND COMPLETE FEELING OF CONFIDENCE BETWEEN COMMANDER AND MEN AND THEY WORKED WITH SPIRIT
3098-5408-0011 LAY AFT HERE AND BRAIL THE SPANKER UP CONTINUED THE CAPTAIN PROMPTLY AY AY SIR WAS THE RESPONSE OF A HALF DOZEN READY HANDS AS THEY SPRANG TO DO HIS BIDDING THE VESSEL WAS THUS BY THE CONSUMMATION OF THESE ORDERS
3098-5408-0012 QUICKLY REDUCED TO HER MAINSAIL FORESAIL AND FORETOPSAIL WHILE SHE FLEW BEFORE THE ON COMING GALE AT THE RATE OF SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN KNOTS AN HOUR
3098-5408-0013 THAT A SEVERE GALE OF WIND WAS GATHERING AND ITS FORCE WAS MOMENTARILY MORE POWERFULLY EXERCISED UPON THE VESSEL SHE STAGGERS UNDER IT MISTER FAULKNER SAID HIS SUPERIOR WITH A CALMNESS THAT EVINCED PERFECT SELF RELIANCE AND COOLNESS
3098-5408-0014 WHILE HE REGARDED THE INCREASING GALE AY SIR YOU CAN DRIVE HER AT ALMOST ANY SPEED ANSWERED THE MATE SHE'S LIKE A METTLED COURSER SIR AND LOVES THE FLEET TRACK SCUD WHILE YOU CAN MISTER FAULKNER IT'S A TRUE NAUTICAL RULE
3098-5408-0015 SOME MEN WILL ALWAYS HEAVE A SHIP TO IF THERE IS A CAP FILL OF DOUBLE REEF THE MAINSAIL SHOUTED THE CAPTAIN INTERRUPTING HIMSELF TO GIVE AN ORDER THAT HE SAW WAS IMPERATIVE WIND BUT I BELIEVE IN SCUDDING IF YOU CAN HE ADDED
3098-5408-0016 DOUBLE REEF FORETOPSAIL AND LOOK YE MISTER FAULKNER HAVE PRESENTER SHEETS BENT ON THE FORESAIL THIS WIND IS IN EARNEST SAID HIS SUPERIOR MORE SERIOUSLY AS HE JUMPED INTO THE MIZZEN SHROUDS AND SCANNED THE SEA TO WINDWARD AGAIN
3098-5408-0017 THE GALE STILL INCREASED AND EVERYTHING BEING NOW MADE SNUG ON BOARD THE SEA WITCH SHE WAS RUN BEFORE IT WITH ALMOST INCREDIBLE SPEED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A STUDY TO HAVE REGARDED THE CALM SELF POSSESSION AND COMPLETE COOLNESS OF THE YOUNG COMMANDER
3098-5408-0018 DURING THIS STARTLING GALE HE NEVER ONCE LEFT HIS POST EVERY INCH OF THE VESSEL SEEMED UNDER HIS EYE AND NOT THE LEAST TRIFLE OF DUTY WAS FOR A MOMENT FORGOTTEN IF POSSIBLE
3098-5408-0019 HE WAS MORE PARTICULAR THAN USUAL THAT HIS ORDERS IN THE SMALLEST ITEM WERE STRICTLY OBSERVED AND THUS WITH HIS IRON WILL AND STRONG INTELLIGENCE HE MASTERED EVERY CONTINGENCY OF THE HOUR IMPARTING THAT INDISPENSABLE CONFIDENCE AMONG HIS PEOPLE
3098-5408-0020 SO REQUISITE TO PERFECT CONTROL THERE WAS A FIRMNESS NOW EXPRESSED IN THE COMPRESSED LIPS AND A STERNNESS IN THE EYE THAT HAD NOT BEFORE BEEN MANIFESTED WHILE THERE WAS A BREATHING OF AUTHORITY IN HIS SMALLEST ORDER
3098-5408-0021 IN AN INSTANT MORE THE SCENE WAS CHANGED WITH TERRIFIC VIOLENCE THE VESSEL FLEW UP IN THE WIND WITH THE RAPIDITY OF THOUGHT AND A REPORT LIKE THAT OF A SCORE OF CANNONS FIRED AT THE SAME MOMENT WAS HEARD ABOVE THE ROAR OF THE WINDS
3098-5408-0022 WHAT LUBBERLY TRICK IS THIS SHOUTED THE CAPTAIN FIERCELY TO THE OLD TAR WHO HELD HIS STATION AT THE WHEEL AND ON WHOSE FAITHFULNESS EVERYTHING DEPENDED THE WHEEL ROPE HAS PARTED ON THE LARBOARD SIDE YOUR HONOR WAS THE REPLY
3098-5408-0023 THAT IS NO MAN'S FAULT SAID HIS COMMANDER BEAR A HAND HERE MISTER FAULKNER AND BEND ON A FRESH WHEEL ROPE BE LIVELY SIR BE LIVELY THE SAILS HAD BEEN BLOWN FROM THE BOLT ROPES IN AN INSTANT OF TIME AND THE VESSEL NOW LAY WALLOWING IN THE SEA
3098-5408-0024 NOW ONCE MORE WAS SEEN THE POWER OF DISCIPLINE AND THE COOLNESS OF THE YOUNG COMMANDER WHOSE WORD WAS LAW IN THAT FLOATING COMMUNITY FIFTY VOICES WERE RAISED IN SHOUTS ABOVE THE STORM SUGGESTING THIS EXPEDIENT AND THAT BUT THAT AGILE FIGURE WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED
3098-5408-0025 SPRANG LIGHTLY INTO THE MIZZEN SHROUDS AND WITH A VOICE THAT WAS HEARD BY EVERY SOUL ON BOARD THE SEA WITCH SHOUTED STERNLY SILENCE IN THE SHIP NOT A VOICE WAS HEARD AND EVERY MAN QUIETLY AWAITED HIS ORDER
3098-5408-0026 CAST THE GASKET OFF THE FOOT OF THE FORE AND AFT FORESAIL AY AY SIR RESPONDED THE MATE WHO HAVING SECURED THE RUDDER NOW HASTENED BY HIS COMMANDER
3098-5408-0027 HAUL THE SHEET TO PORT AY AY SIR BELAY THAT AS THE VESSEL FELT THE POWER OF THE CANVASS THUS OPPORTUNELY LOOSED AND BROUGHT TO BEAR SHE GRADUALLY PAID OFF BEFORE THE WIND AND ONCE MORE HAD STEERAGE WAY
3098-5408-0028 ANOTHER FORESAIL WAS NOW BENT AND THIS TIME DOUBLE REEFED THE FORETOPSAIL TOO WAS BENT CLOSE REEFED AND FURLED WHILE THE FORE AND AFT FORESAIL WAS ONCE MORE STOWED
3098-5408-0029 THEN THE WIND ONCE MORE HAULED TO THE NORTHWEST AND THE SEA WITCH DONNED HEIR FORE AND AFT RIG ON ALL HER MASTS
3098-5408-0030 UNTIL THE LOFTY HEADLANDS OF THE CAPE DE VERDS HOVE GRADUALLY IN SIGHT AND THE FLEET CLIPPER CRAFT MADE HER ANCHORAGE IN THE HARBOR OF PORT PRAYA THE SEA WITCH WHATEVER HER BUSINESS IN THIS HARBOR
3098-5408-0031 SEEMED ABLE TO TRANSACT IT WITHOUT VENTURING INSIDE THE FORTS OR TAKING STRONGER MOORINGS THAN A SINGLE ANCHOR COULD AFFORD HER AT THIS SHE RODE WITH MYSTERIOUS QUIET NOT A SOUL OF THE FULL COMPLEMENT OF MEN ON BOARD WERE VISIBLE FROM THE SHORE
3098-5408-0032 NOW AND THEN PERHAPS THE HEAD OF SOME TALLER HAND THAN HIS FELLOWS MIGHT LOOM UP ABOVE THE BULWARKS AT THE WAIST OR A SOLITARY SEAMAN CREEP QUIETLY ALOFT TO REAVE A SHEET THROUGH SOME BLOCK OR SECURE SOME PORTION OF THE RIGGING
3098-5408-0033 THE CAPTAIN SCARCELY WAITED FOR HIS LAND TACKLE TO HOLD THE VESSEL BEFORE A QUARTER BOAT WAS LOWERED AWAY AND WITH A HALF DOZEN STURDY FELLOWS AS ITS CREW PULLED BOLDLY TOWARDS THE MAIN LANDING WHERE HE STEPPED ASHORE AND DISAPPEARED
3098-5408-0034 AND THE WAY IN WHICH SHE WAS MOORED IF NEED BE THREE MINUTES WOULD HAVE COVERED HER WITH CANVASS AND SLIPPING HER CABLE SHE COULD IN THAT SPACE OF TIME HAD THE ORDER BEEN ISSUED FROM HER QUARTER DECK HAVE BEEN UNDER WAY AND LOOKING ONCE MORE SEAWARD
3098-5408-0035 WHATEVER HER BUSINESS IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT PROMPTNESS SECRECY AND LARGE PRECAUTION WERE ELEMENTS OF ITS SUCCESS NOR HAD THESE CHARACTERISTICS WHICH WE HAVE NAMED ESCAPED ENTIRE OBSERVATION OF THE PEOPLE ON SHORE
