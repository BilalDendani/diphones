6399-278844-0000 A DIGRESSION IN THE MODERN KIND WE WHOM THE WORLD IS PLEASED TO HONOUR WITH THE TITLE OF MODERN AUTHORS
6399-278844-0001 IF OUR ENDEAVOURS HAD NOT BEEN SO HIGHLY SERVICEABLE TO THE GENERAL GOOD OF MANKIND THIS O UNIVERSE IS THE ADVENTUROUS ATTEMPT OF ME THY SECRETARY
6399-278844-0002 SINCE WITH A WORLD OF PAINS AND ART DISSECTED THE CARCASS OF HUMAN NATURE AND READ MANY USEFUL LECTURES UPON THE SEVERAL PARTS BOTH CONTAINING AND CONTAINED TILL AT LAST IT SMELT SO STRONG I COULD PRESERVE IT NO LONGER
6399-278844-0003 UPON WHICH I HAVE BEEN AT A GREAT EXPENSE TO FIT UP ALL THE BONES WITH EXACT CONTEXTURE AND IN DUE SYMMETRY
6399-278844-0004 BUT NOT TO DIGRESS FURTHER IN THE MIDST OF A DIGRESSION AS I HAVE KNOWN SOME AUTHORS ENCLOSE DIGRESSIONS IN ONE ANOTHER LIKE A NEST OF BOXES I DO AFFIRM THAT HAVING CAREFULLY CUT UP HUMAN NATURE
6399-278844-0005 THAT THE PUBLIC GOOD OF MANKIND IS PERFORMED BY TWO WAYS INSTRUCTION AND DIVERSION
6399-278844-0006 THAT AS MANKIND IS NOW DISPOSED HE RECEIVES MUCH GREATER ADVANTAGE BY BEING DIVERTED THAN INSTRUCTED HIS EPIDEMICAL DISEASES BEING FASTIDIOSITY AMORPHY AND OSCITATION WHEREAS IN THE PRESENT UNIVERSAL EMPIRE OF WIT AND LEARNING
6399-278844-0007 THERE SEEMS BUT LITTLE MATTER LEFT FOR INSTRUCTION HOWEVER IN COMPLIANCE WITH A LESSON OF GREAT AGE AND AUTHORITY I HAVE ATTEMPTED CARRYING THE POINT IN ALL ITS HEIGHTS AND ACCORDINGLY THROUGHOUT THIS DIVINE TREATISE HAVE SKILFULLY KNEADED UP BOTH TOGETHER
6399-278844-0008 WHEN I CONSIDER HOW EXCEEDINGLY OUR ILLUSTRIOUS MODERNS HAVE ECLIPSED THE WEAK GLIMMERING LIGHTS OF THE ANCIENTS AND TURNED THEM OUT OF THE ROAD OF ALL FASHIONABLE COMMERCE TO A DEGREE THAT OUR CHOICE TOWN WITS OF MOST REFINED ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE IN GRAVE DISPUTE
6399-278844-0009 WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN EVER ANY ANCIENTS OR NO IN WHICH POINT WE ARE LIKE TO RECEIVE WONDERFUL SATISFACTION FROM THE MOST USEFUL LABOURS AND LUCUBRATIONS OF THAT WORTHY MODERN DOCTOR BENTLEY
6399-278844-0010 IN A SMALL PORTABLE VOLUME OF ALL THINGS THAT ARE TO BE KNOWN OR BELIEVED OR IMAGINED OR PRACTISED IN LIFE I AM HOWEVER FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH AN ENTERPRISE WAS THOUGHT ON SOME TIME AGO BY A GREAT PHILOSOPHER OF O BRAZILE
6399-278844-0011 THE METHOD HE PROPOSED WAS BY A CERTAIN CURIOUS RECEIPT A NOSTRUM WHICH AFTER HIS UNTIMELY DEATH I FOUND AMONG HIS PAPERS AND DO HERE OUT OF MY GREAT AFFECTION TO THE MODERN LEARNED
6399-278844-0012 PRESENT THEM WITH IT NOT DOUBTING IT MAY ONE DAY ENCOURAGE SOME WORTHY UNDERTAKER YOU TAKE FAIR CORRECT COPIES WELL BOUND IN CALF'S SKIN AND LETTERED AT THE BACK OF ALL MODERN BODIES OF ARTS AND SCIENCES WHATSOEVER
6399-278844-0013 AND IN WHAT LANGUAGE YOU PLEASE THESE YOU DISTIL IN BALNEO MARIAE INFUSING QUINTESSENCE OF POPPY
6399-278844-0014 LETTING ALL THAT IS VOLATILE EVAPORATE YOU PRESERVE ONLY THE FIRST RUNNING WHICH IS AGAIN TO BE DISTILLED SEVENTEEN TIMES
6399-278844-0015 THIS YOU KEEP IN A GLASS VIAL HERMETICALLY SEALED FOR ONE AND TWENTY DAYS THEN YOU BEGIN YOUR CATHOLIC TREATISE
6399-278844-0016 THREE DROPS OF THIS ELIXIR SNUFFING IT STRONGLY UP YOUR NOSE IT WILL DILATE ITSELF ABOUT THE BRAIN WHERE THERE IS ANY IN FOURTEEN MINUTES
6399-278844-0017 MEDULLAS EXCERPTA QUAEDAMS FLORILEGIAS AND THE LIKE ALL DISPOSED INTO GREAT ORDER AND REDUCIBLE UPON PAPER I MUST NEEDS OWN IT WAS
6399-278844-0018 HAVE ADVENTURED UPON SO DARING AN ATTEMPT NEVER ACHIEVED OR UNDERTAKEN BEFORE BUT BY A CERTAIN AUTHOR CALLED HOMER IN WHOM THOUGH OTHERWISE A PERSON NOT WITHOUT SOME ABILITIES AND FOR AN ANCIENT OF A TOLERABLE GENIUS
6399-278844-0019 WITS I COULD NEVER YET DISCOVER THE LEAST DIRECTION ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THAT USEFUL INSTRUMENT A SAVE ALL FOR WANT OF WHICH
6399-278844-0020 BUT I HAVE STILL BEHIND A FAULT FAR MORE NOTORIOUS TO TAX THIS AUTHOR WITH I MEAN HIS GROSS IGNORANCE IN THE COMMON LAWS OF THIS REALM
6399-278844-0021 MISTER WOTTON BACHELOR OF DIVINITY IN HIS INCOMPARABLE TREATISE OF ANCIENT AND MODERN LEARNING A BOOK NEVER TO BE SUFFICIENTLY VALUED WHETHER WE CONSIDER THE HAPPY TURNS AND FLOWINGS OF THE AUTHOR'S WIT
6399-278844-0022 THE GREAT USEFULNESS OF HIS SUBLIME DISCOVERIES UPON THE SUBJECT OF FLIES AND SPITTLE OR THE LABORIOUS ELOQUENCE OF HIS STYLE AND I CANNOT FORBEAR DOING THAT AUTHOR THE JUSTICE OF MY PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGMENTS FOR THE GREAT HELPS AND LIFTINGS I HAD
6399-278844-0023 OUT OF HIS INCOMPARABLE PIECE WHILE I WAS PENNING THIS TREATISE BUT BESIDES THESE OMISSIONS IN HOMER ALREADY MENTIONED THE CURIOUS READER WILL ALSO OBSERVE SEVERAL DEFECTS IN THAT AUTHOR'S WRITINGS FOR WHICH HE IS NOT ALTOGETHER SO ACCOUNTABLE
6399-278844-0024 FOR WHEREAS EVERY BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE HAS RECEIVED SUCH WONDERFUL ACQUIREMENTS SINCE HIS AGE
6399-278844-0025 HE COULD BE SO VERY PERFECT IN MODERN DISCOVERIES AS HIS ADVOCATES PRETEND
6399-278844-0026 AND THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD BUT I CHALLENGE ANY OF HIS ADMIRERS TO SHOW ME IN ALL HIS WRITINGS A COMPLETE ACCOUNT OF THE SPLEEN
6399-278844-0027 WHAT CAN BE MORE DEFECTIVE AND UNSATISFACTORY THAN HIS LONG DISSERTATION UPON TEA AND AS TO HIS METHOD OF SALIVATION WITHOUT MERCURY
6399-278844-0028 TO BE RELIED ON IT WAS TO SUPPLY SUCH MOMENTOUS DEFECTS THAT I HAVE BEEN PREVAILED ON AFTER LONG SOLICITATION TO TAKE PEN IN HAND AND I DARE VENTURE TO PROMISE THE JUDICIOUS READER SHALL FIND NOTHING NEGLECTED HERE
6399-278844-0029 THAT CAN BE OF USE UPON ANY EMERGENCY OF LIFE I AM CONFIDENT TO HAVE INCLUDED AND EXHAUSTED ALL THAT HUMAN IMAGINATION CAN RISE OR FALL TO PARTICULARLY I RECOMMEND TO THE PERUSAL OF THE LEARNED CERTAIN
6399-278844-0030 WHEREOF I SHALL ONLY MENTION AMONG A GREAT MANY MORE MY
6399-278844-0031 A CURIOUS INVENTION ABOUT MOUSE TRAPS A UNIVERSAL RULE OF REASON
6399-278844-0032 TOGETHER WITH A MOST USEFUL ENGINE FOR CATCHING OF OWLS ALL WHICH THE JUDICIOUS READER WILL FIND LARGELY TREATED ON IN THE SEVERAL PARTS OF THIS DISCOURSE
6399-278844-0033 OF THIS POLITE AND LEARNED AGE WHEN THEY WOULD CORRECT THE ILL NATURE OF CRITICAL OR INFORM THE IGNORANCE OF COURTEOUS READERS
6399-278844-0034 BOTH IN VERSE AND PROSE WHEREIN IF THE WRITERS HAD NOT BEEN PLEASED OUT OF THEIR GREAT HUMANITY AND AFFECTION TO THE PUBLIC TO GIVE US A NICE DETAIL OF THE SUBLIME AND THE ADMIRABLE THEY CONTAIN
6399-278844-0035 HAD BEEN MORE PROPER IN A PREFACE AND MORE AGREEABLE TO THE MODE WHICH USUALLY DIRECTS IT THERE
6399-278844-0036 I CLAIM AN ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY IN RIGHT AS THE FRESHEST MODERN WHICH GIVES ME A DESPOTIC POWER
6399-278844-0037 DISAPPROVE AND DECLARE AGAINST THAT PERNICIOUS CUSTOM OF MAKING THE PREFACE A BILL OF FARE TO THE BOOK FOR I HAVE ALWAYS LOOKED UPON IT AS A HIGH POINT OF INDISCRETION IN MONSTERMONGERS AND OTHER RETAILERS OF STRANGE SIGHTS TO HANG OUT A FAIR
6399-278844-0038 LARGE PICTURE OVER THE DOOR DRAWN AFTER THE LIFE WITH A MOST ELOQUENT DESCRIPTION UNDERNEATH
6399-278844-0039 THOUGH OFTEN INVITED BY THE URGING AND ATTENDING ORATOR WITH HIS LAST MOVING AND STANDING PIECE OF RHETORIC SIR UPON MY WORD
6399-278844-0040 ADVERTISEMENTS INTRODUCTIONS PROLEGOMENAS APPARATUSES TO THE READERS'S THIS EXPEDIENT WAS ADMIRABLE AT FIRST OUR GREAT DRYDEN HAS LONG CARRIED IT AS FAR AS IT WOULD GO AND WITH INCREDIBLE SUCCESS
6399-278844-0041 WOULD NEVER HAVE SUSPECTED HIM TO BE SO GREAT A POET IF HE HAD NOT ASSURED THEM SO FREQUENTLY IN HIS PREFACES THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THEY COULD EITHER DOUBT OR FORGET IT PERHAPS IT MAY BE SO
6399-278844-0042 HOWEVER I MUCH FEAR HIS INSTRUCTIONS HAVE EDIFIED OUT OF THEIR PLACE AND TAUGHT MEN TO GROW WISER IN CERTAIN POINTS WHERE HE NEVER INTENDED THEY SHOULD
6399-278844-0043 CONSIDERABLE NUMBER IS KNOWN TO PROCEED CRITICS AND WITS BY READING NOTHING ELSE INTO WHICH TWO FACTIONS I THINK ALL PRESENT READERS MAY JUSTLY BE DIVIDED NOW FOR MYSELF I PROFESS TO BE OF THE FORMER SORT
6399-278844-0044 AND THEREFORE HAVING THE MODERN INCLINATION TO EXPATIATE UPON THE BEAUTY OF MY OWN PRODUCTIONS
6399-278844-0045 WHERE AS IT NOW LIES IT MAKES A VERY CONSIDERABLE ADDITION TO THE BULK OF THE VOLUME A CIRCUMSTANCE BY NO MEANS TO BE NEGLECTED BY A SKILFUL WRITER HAVING THUS PAID MY DUE DEFERENCE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT TO AN ESTABLISHED CUSTOM OF OUR NEWEST AUTHORS
6399-278844-0046 BY A LONG DIGRESSION UNSOUGHT FOR AND A UNIVERSAL CENSURE UNPROVOKED
