594-127731-0000 UPON AN EVENING OF THE FORGOTTEN YEARS THE GODS WERE SEATED ON THE HILLS AND ALL THE LITTLE RIVERS OF THE WORLD LAY COILED AT THEIR FEET ASLEEP
594-127731-0001 AND BEHIND SLID THERE MARCHED A MILLION WAVES ALL FOLLOWING SLID AND TRAMPING UP THE TWILIGHT AND SLID TOUCHED EARTH IN ONE OF HER GREAT GREEN VALLEYS THAT DIVIDE THE SOUTH AND HERE HE ENCAMPED FOR THE NIGHT WITH ALL HIS WAVES ABOUT HIM
594-127731-0002 BUT TO THE GODS AS THEY SAT UPON THEIR HILLTOPS A NEW CRY CAME CRYING OVER THE GREEN SPACES THAT LAY BELOW THE HILLS AND THE GODS SAID THIS IS NEITHER THE CRY OF LIFE NOR YET THE WHISPER OF DEATH
594-127731-0003 WHAT IS THIS NEW CRY THAT THE GODS HAVE NEVER COMMANDED YET WHICH COMES TO THE EARS OF THE GODS
594-127731-0004 CALLING THE SOUTH WIND TO THEM AND AGAIN THE GODS SHOUTED ALL TOGETHER MAKING THE CRY OF THE NORTH CALLING THE NORTH WIND TO THEM AND THUS THEY GATHERED TO THEM ALL THEIR WINDS
594-127731-0005 TO FIND WHAT THING IT WAS THAT CALLED WITH THE NEW CRY AND TO DRIVE IT AWAY FROM THE GODS THEN ALL THE WINDS HARNESSED UP THEIR CLOUDS AND DRAVE FORTH TILL THEY CAME TO THE GREAT GREEN VALLEY THAT DIVIDES THE SOUTH IN TWAIN
594-127731-0006 AND THERE FOUND SLID WITH ALL HIS WAVES ABOUT HIM THEN FOR A SPACE SLID AND THE FOUR WINDS STRUGGLED WITH ONE ANOTHER TILL THE STRENGTH OF THE WINDS WAS GONE AND THEY LIMPED BACK TO THE GODS THEIR MASTERS AND SAID WE HAVE MET THIS NEW THING
594-127731-0007 THAT HAS COME UPON THE EARTH AND HAVE STRIVEN AGAINST ITS ARMIES BUT COULD NOT DRIVE THEM FORTH AND THE NEW THING IS BEAUTIFUL BUT VERY ANGRY AND IS CREEPING TOWARDS THE GODS
594-127731-0008 BUT SLID ADVANCED AND LED HIS ARMIES UP THE VALLEY AND INCH BY INCH AND MILE BY MILE HE CONQUERED THE LANDS OF THE GODS THEN FROM THEIR HILLS THE GODS SENT DOWN A GREAT ARRAY OF CLIFFS AGAINST HARD RED ROCKS
594-127731-0009 AND BADE THEM MARCH AGAINST SLID AND THE CLIFFS MARCHED DOWN TILL THEY CAME AND STOOD BEFORE SLID AND LEANED THEIR HEADS FORWARD AND FROWNED AND STOOD STAUNCH TO GUARD THE LANDS OF THE GODS AGAINST THE MIGHT OF THE SEA SHUTTING SLID OFF FROM THE WORLD
594-127731-0010 THEN SLID SENT SOME OF HIS SMALLER WAVES TO SEARCH OUT WHAT STOOD AGAINST HIM AND THE CLIFFS SHATTERED THEM BUT SLID WENT BACK AND GATHERED TOGETHER A HOARD OF HIS GREATEST WAVES AND HURLED THEM AGAINST THE CLIFFS AND THE CLIFFS SHATTERED THEM
594-127731-0011 AND AGAIN SLID CALLED UP OUT OF HIS DEEP A MIGHTY ARRAY OF WAVES AND SENT THEM ROARING AGAINST THE GUARDIANS OF THE GODS AND THE RED ROCKS FROWNED AND SMOTE THEM AND ONCE AGAIN SLID GATHERED HIS GREATER WAVES AND HURLED THEM AGAINST THE CLIFFS
594-127731-0012 AND WHEN THE WAVES WERE SCATTERED LIKE THOSE BEFORE THEM THE FEET OF THE CLIFFS WERE NO LONGER STANDING FIRM AND THEIR FACES WERE SCARRED AND BATTERED THEN INTO EVERY CLEFT THAT STOOD IN THE ROCKS SLID SENT HIS HUGEST WAVE AND OTHERS FOLLOWED BEHIND IT
594-127731-0013 AND SLID HIMSELF SEIZED HOLD OF HUGE ROCKS WITH HIS CLAWS AND TORE THEM DOWN AND STAMPED THEM UNDER HIS FEET AND WHEN THE TUMULT WAS OVER THE SEA HAD WON
594-127731-0014 AND OVER THE BROKEN REMNANTS OF THOSE RED CLIFFS THE ARMIES OF SLID MARCHED ON AND UP THE LONG GREEN VALLEY THEN THE GODS HEARD SLID EXULTING FAR AWAY AND SINGING SONGS OF TRIUMPH OVER THEIR BATTERED CLIFFS
594-127731-0015 AND EVER THE TRAMP OF HIS ARMIES SOUNDED NEARER AND NEARER IN THE LISTENING EARS OF THE GODS THEN THE GODS CALLED TO THEIR DOWNLANDS TO SAVE THEIR WORLD FROM SLID AND THE DOWNLANDS GATHERED THEMSELVES AND MARCHED AWAY A GREAT WHITE LINE OF GLEAMING CLIFFS
594-127731-0016 AND HALTED BEFORE SLID THEN SLID ADVANCED NO MORE AND LULLED HIS LEGIONS AND WHILE HIS WAVES WERE LOW HE SOFTLY CROONED A SONG SUCH AS ONCE LONG AGO HAD TROUBLED THE STARS AND BROUGHT DOWN TEARS OUT OF THE TWILIGHT
594-127731-0017 BUT THE SONG THAT ONCE HAD TROUBLED THE STARS WENT MOANING ON AWAKING PENT DESIRES TILL FULL AT THE FEET OF THE GODS THE MELODY FELL THEN THE BLUE RIVERS THAT LAY CURLED ASLEEP OPENED THEIR GLEAMING EYES UNCURLED THEMSELVES AND SHOOK THEIR RUSHES
594-127731-0018 AND MAKING A STIR AMONG THE HILLS CREPT DOWN TO FIND THE SEA AND PASSING ACROSS THE WORLD THEY CAME AT LAST TO WHERE THE WHITE CLIFFS STOOD AND COMING BEHIND THEM SPLIT THEM HERE AND THERE AND WENT THROUGH THEIR BROKEN RANKS TO SLID AT LAST
594-127731-0019 AND THE GODS WERE ANGRY WITH THEIR TRAITOROUS STREAMS THEN SLID CEASED FROM SINGING THE SONG THAT LURES THE WORLD AND GATHERED UP HIS LEGIONS
594-127731-0020 AND ALL WENT MARCHING ON TO ASSAIL THE CLIFFS OF THE GODS AND WHEREVER THE RIVERS HAD BROKEN THE RANKS OF THE CLIFFS
594-127731-0021 AND THE GODS ON THEIR HILL TOPS HEARD ONCE MORE THE VOICE OF SLID EXULTING OVER THEIR CLIFFS ALREADY MORE THAN HALF THE WORLD LAY SUBJECT TO SLID AND STILL HIS ARMIES ADVANCED
594-127731-0022 AND THE PEOPLE OF SLID THE FISHES AND THE LONG EELS WENT IN AND OUT OF ARBOURS THAT ONCE WERE DEAR TO THE GODS THEN THE GODS FEARED FOR THEIR DOMINION AND TO THE INNERMOST SACRED RECESSES OF THE MOUNTAINS TO THE VERY HEART OF THE HILLS THE GODS TROOPED OFF TOGETHER
594-127731-0023 AND THEREAFTER FASHIONED FIELDS AND HOLLOWS VALLEYS AND OTHER HILLS TO LIE ABOUT THY FEET AND NOW TINTAGGON THINE ANCIENT LORDS THE GODS ARE FACING A NEW THING WHICH OVERTHROWS THE OLD GO THEREFORE THOU TINTAGGON AND STAND UP AGAINST SLID
594-127731-0024 AND GOING ACROSS THE GREEN EARTH CAME DOWN TO AMBRADY AT THE VALLEY'S EDGE AND THERE MET THE FOREMOST OF SLID'S FIERCE ARMIES CONQUERING THE WORLD AND AGAINST HIM SLID HURLED THE FORCE OF A WHOLE BAY WHICH LASHED ITSELF HIGH OVER TINTAGGON'S KNEES
594-127731-0025 AND STREAMED AROUND HIS FLANKS AND THEN FELL AND WAS LOST TINTAGGON STILL STOOD FIRM FOR THE HONOUR AND DOMINION OF HIS LORDS THE ELDER GODS THEN SLID WENT TO TINTAGGON AND SAID LET US NOW MAKE A TRUCE
594-127731-0026 SHALL KNOW THE NEW GOD SLID THEN SHALL MINE ARMIES STRIVE WITH THEE NO MORE AND THOU AND I SHALL BE THE EQUAL LORDS OF THE WHOLE EARTH WHEN ALL THE WORLD IS SINGING THE CHAUNT OF SLID AND THY HEAD ALONE SHALL BE LIFTED ABOVE MINE ARMIES WHEN RIVAL HILLS ARE DEAD
594-127731-0027 AND I WILL DECK THEE WITH ALL THE ROBES OF THE SEA AND ALL THE PLUNDER THAT I HAVE TAKEN IN RARE CITIES SHALL BE PILED BEFORE THY FEET TINTAGGON I HAVE CONQUERED ALL THE STARS MY SONG SWELLS THROUGH ALL THE SPACE BESIDES I COME VICTORIOUS FROM MAHN AND KHANAGAT
594-127731-0028 ON THE FURTHEST EDGE OF THE WORLDS AND THOU AND I ARE TO BE EQUAL LORDS WHEN THE OLD GODS ARE GONE AND THE GREEN EARTH KNOWETH SLID BEHOLD ME GLEAMING AZURE AND FAIR WITH A THOUSAND SMILES AND SWAYED BY A THOUSAND MOODS AND TINTAGGON ANSWERED
594-127731-0029 THEN FROM TINTAGGON'S MARBLE FRONT THE SEA FELL BACKWARDS CRYING ON TO A BROKEN SHORE AND RIPPLE BY RIPPLE STRAGGLED BACK TO SLID SAYING TINTAGGON STANDS
594-127731-0030 FAR OUT BEYOND THE BATTERED SHORE THAT LAY AT TINTAGGON'S FEET SLID RESTED LONG AND SENT THE NAUTILUS TO DRIFT UP AND DOWN BEFORE TINTAGGON'S EYES AND HE AND HIS ARMIES SAT SINGING IDLE SONGS OF DREAMY ISLANDS FAR AWAY TO THE SOUTH
594-127731-0031 AND OF THE STILL STARS WHENCE THEY HAD STOLEN FORTH
594-127731-0032 ONE MORNING AS SLID SANG OF OLD OUTRAGEOUS WARS
594-127731-0033 HE SUDDENLY LAUNCHED FIVE OCEANS OUT OF THE DEEP ALL TO ATTACK TINTAGGON AND THE FIVE OCEANS SPRANG UPON TINTAGGON AND PASSED ABOVE HIS HEAD ONE BY ONE THE GRIP OF THE OCEANS LOOSENED
594-127731-0034 AND ON THAT MORNING THE MIGHT OF ALL FIVE OCEANS LAY DEAD AT TINTAGGON'S FEET THAT WHICH SLID HAD CONQUERED HE STILL HELD AND THERE IS NOW NO LONGER A GREAT GREEN VALLEY IN THE SOUTH
594-127731-0035 BUT ALL THAT TINTAGGON HAD GUARDED AGAINST SLID HE GAVE BACK TO THE GODS VERY CALM THE SEA LIES NOW ABOUT TINTAGGON'S FEET WHERE HE STANDS ALL BLACK AMID CRUMBLED CLIFFS OF WHITE WITH RED ROCKS PILED ABOUT HIS FEET
594-127731-0036 AND OFTEN THE SEA RETREATS FAR OUT ALONG THE SHORE AND OFTEN WAVE BY WAVE COMES MARCHING IN WITH THE SOUND OF THE TRAMPING OF ARMIES THAT ALL MAY STILL REMEMBER THE GREAT FIGHT THAT SURGED ABOUT TINTAGGON ONCE WHEN HE GUARDED THE GODS AND THE GREEN EARTH AGAINST SLID
594-127731-0037 SOMETIMES IN THEIR DREAMS THE WAR SCARRED WARRIORS OF SLID STILL LIFT THEIR HEADS AND CRY THEIR BATTLE CRY THEN DO DARK CLOUDS GATHER ABOUT TINTAGGON'S SWARTHY BROW AND HE STANDS OUT MENACING SEEN AFAR BY SHIPS WHERE ONCE HE CONQUERED SLID
