104-132091-0005 SO DARLINGS TAKE THIS LITTLE CHILDISH STORY
104-132091-0006 AND AS WITH CARELESS HANDS YOU TURN THE PAGES
104-132091-0007 IT WAS A HOT DAY THE SKY WAS VERY BLUE
104-132091-0008 LIKE GREAT SWANS WENT FLOATING OVER IT TO AND FRO JUST OPPOSITE ME WAS A CLUMP OF GREEN RUSHES WITH DARK VELVETY SPIKES AND AMONG THEM ONE SINGLE TALL RED CARDINAL FLOWER WHICH WAS BENDING OVER THE BROOK
104-132091-0009 AS IF TO SEE ITS OWN BEAUTIFUL FACE IN THE WATER BUT THE CARDINAL DID NOT SEEM TO BE VAIN THE PICTURE WAS SO PRETTY THAT I SAT A LONG TIME ENJOYING IT SUDDENLY CLOSE TO ME TWO SMALL VOICES BEGAN TO TALK
104-132091-0010 OR TO SING FOR I COULDN'T TELL EXACTLY WHICH IT WAS ONE VOICE WAS SHRILL THE OTHER WHICH WAS A LITTLE DEEPER SOUNDED VERY POSITIVE AND CROSS THEY WERE EVIDENTLY DISPUTING ABOUT SOMETHING
104-132091-0011 FOR THEY SAID THE SAME WORDS OVER AND OVER AGAIN THESE WERE THE WORDS KATY DID KATY DIDN'T SHE DID SHE DIDN'T SHE DID SHE DIDN'T DID DIDN'T
104-132091-0012 I THINK THEY MUST HAVE REPEATED THEM AT LEAST A HUNDRED TIMES I GOT UP FROM MY SEAT TO SEE IF I COULD FIND THE SPEAKERS AND SURE ENOUGH THERE ON ONE OF THE CAT TAIL BULRUSHES I SPIED TWO TINY PALE GREEN CREATURES
104-132091-0013 THEIR EYES SEEMED TO BE WEAK FOR THEY BOTH WORE BLACK GOGGLES THEY HAD SIX LEGS APIECE TWO SHORT ONES TWO NOT SO SHORT AND TWO VERY LONG
104-132091-0014 THEY BEGAN WALKING UP THE RUSH AND THEN I SAW THAT THEY MOVED EXACTLY LIKE AN OLD FASHIONED GIG IN FACT IF I HADN'T BEEN TOO BIG I THINK I SHOULD HAVE HEARD THEM CREAK AS THEY WENT ALONG
104-132091-0015 THEY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING SO LONG AS I WAS THERE BUT THE MOMENT MY BACK WAS TURNED THEY BEGAN TO QUARREL AGAIN AND IN THE SAME OLD WORDS KATY DID KATY DIDN'T SHE DID SHE DIDN'T
104-132091-0016 AS I WALKED HOME I FELL TO THINKING ABOUT ANOTHER KATY A KATY I ONCE KNEW
104-132091-0017 THIS LITTLE STORY GREW IN MY HEAD AND I RESOLVED TO WRITE IT DOWN FOR YOU I HAVE DONE IT AND IN MEMORY OF MY TWO LITTLE FRIENDS ON THE BULRUSH I GIVE IT THEIR NAME HERE IT IS THE STORY OF WHAT KATY DID
104-132091-0018 KATY'S NAME WAS KATY CARR SHE LIVED IN THE TOWN OF BURNET WHICH WASN'T A VERY BIG TOWN
104-132091-0019 ON THE OTHER SIDE WERE WOOD PILES AND BARNS AND AN ICE HOUSE BEHIND WAS A KITCHEN GARDEN SLOPING TO THE SOUTH AND BEHIND THAT A PASTURE WITH A BROOK IN IT
104-132091-0020 TWO RED ONES A YELLOW ONE WITH SHARP HORNS TIPPED WITH TIN AND A DEAR LITTLE WHITE ONE NAMED DAISY THERE WERE SIX OF THE CARR CHILDREN FOUR GIRLS AND TWO BOYS KATY THE OLDEST WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD
104-132091-0021 LITTLE PHIL THE YOUNGEST WAS FOUR AND THE REST FITTED IN BETWEEN DOCTOR CARR THEIR PAPA WAS A DEAR KIND BUSY MAN WHO WAS AWAY FROM HOME ALL DAY AND SOMETIMES ALL NIGHT TOO
104-132091-0022 THE CHILDREN HADN'T ANY MAMMA SHE HAD DIED WHEN PHIL WAS A BABY FOUR YEARS BEFORE MY STORY BEGAN KATY COULD REMEMBER HER PRETTY WELL TO THE REST SHE WAS BUT A SAD SWEET NAME
104-132091-0023 SPOKEN ON SUNDAY AND AT PRAYER TIMES
104-132091-0024 IN PLACE OF THIS MAMMA WHOM THEY RECOLLECTED SO DIMLY THERE WAS AUNT IZZIE PAPA'S SISTER WHO CAME TO TAKE CARE OF THEM WHEN MAMMA WENT AWAY ON THAT LONG JOURNEY FROM WHICH FOR SO MANY MONTHS
104-132091-0025 THE LITTLE ONES KEPT HOPING SHE MIGHT RETURN AUNT IZZIE WAS A SMALL WOMAN SHARP FACED AND THIN RATHER OLD LOOKING AND VERY NEAT AND PARTICULAR ABOUT EVERYTHING SHE MEANT TO BE KIND TO THE CHILDREN BUT THEY PUZZLED HER MUCH
104-132091-0026 BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT A BIT LIKE HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD AUNT IZZIE HAD BEEN A GENTLE TIDY LITTLE THING WHO LOVED TO SIT AS CURLY LOCKS DID SEWING LONG SEAMS IN THE PARLOR AND TO HAVE HER HEAD PATTED BY OLDER PEOPLE AND BE TOLD THAT SHE WAS A GOOD GIRL
104-132091-0027 WHEREAS KATY TORE HER DRESS EVERY DAY HATED SEWING AND DIDN'T CARE A BUTTON ABOUT BEING CALLED GOOD WHILE CLOVER AND ELSIE SHIED OFF LIKE RESTLESS PONIES WHEN ANY ONE TRIED TO PAT THEIR HEADS IT WAS VERY PERPLEXING TO AUNT IZZIE
104-132091-0028 AND ENCOURAGED CLIMBING AND ROUGH PLAYS IN SPITE OF THE BUMPS AND RAGGED CLOTHES WHICH RESULTED IN FACT THERE WAS JUST ONE HALF HOUR OF THE DAY WHEN AUNT IZZIE WAS REALLY SATISFIED ABOUT HER CHARGES AND THAT WAS THE HALF HOUR BEFORE BREAKFAST
104-132091-0029 AT THIS TIME SHE LOOKED AT THEM WITH PLEASED EYES THEY WERE ALL SO SPICK AND SPAN WITH SUCH NICELY BRUSHED JACKETS AND SUCH NEATLY COMBED HAIR BUT THE MOMENT THE BELL RANG HER COMFORT WAS OVER FROM THAT TIME ON
104-132091-0030 THEY WERE WHAT SHE CALLED NOT FIT TO BE SEEN THE NEIGHBORS PITIED HER VERY MUCH
104-132091-0031 AND SAY TO EACH OTHER WHAT A SIGHT OF WASHING THOSE CHILDREN MADE
104-132091-0032 ALWAYS NEVER AUNTY BOYS AND GIRLS WILL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE LITTLE CARRS AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD EVER HAVE A BETTER CHANCE
104-132091-0033 THAN ONE DAY WHEN FIVE OUT OF THE SIX WERE PERCHED ON TOP OF THE ICE HOUSE LIKE CHICKENS ON A ROOST
104-132091-0034 IT WAS ONLY A LOW ROOF SET OVER A HOLE IN THE GROUND AND AS IT STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SIDE YARD IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO THE CHILDREN THAT THE SHORTEST ROAD TO EVERY PLACE WAS UP ONE OF ITS SLOPES AND DOWN THE OTHER
104-132091-0035 AND THEN STILL KEEPING THE SITTING POSITION TO LET GO
104-132091-0036 SHOES AND TROUSERS AND CLOTHES GENERALLY WERE AUNT IZZIE'S AFFAIR THEIRS WAS TO SLIDE AND ENJOY THEMSELVES CLOVER NEXT IN AGE TO KATY
104-132091-0037 SHE WAS A FAIR SWEET DUMPLING OF A GIRL WITH THICK PIG TAILS OF LIGHT BROWN HAIR AND SHORT SIGHTED BLUE EYES WHICH SEEMED TO HOLD TEARS JUST READY TO FALL FROM UNDER THE BLUE REALLY CLOVER WAS THE JOLLIEST LITTLE THING IN THE WORLD
104-132091-0038 CLOVER HELD FAST AND WOULD NOT LET GO DOCTOR CARR WHO WASN'T ATTENDING PARTICULARLY HEARD NOTHING BUT THE PATHETIC TONE OF CLOVER'S VOICE AS SHE SAID
104-132091-0039 ME WANT DOLLY AND WITHOUT STOPPING TO INQUIRE HE CALLED OUT SHARPLY FOR SHAME KATY GIVE YOUR SISTER HER DOLL AT ONCE WHICH KATY MUCH SURPRISED DID WHILE CLOVER PURRED IN TRIUMPH
104-132091-0040 LIKE A SATISFIED KITTEN CLOVER WAS SUNNY AND SWEET TEMPERED A LITTLE INDOLENT AND VERY MODEST ABOUT HERSELF THOUGH IN FACT SHE WAS PARTICULARLY CLEVER IN ALL SORTS OF GAMES
104-132091-0041 EVERYBODY LOVED HER AND SHE LOVED EVERYBODY ESPECIALLY KATY WHOM SHE LOOKED UP TO AS ONE OF THE WISEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD PRETTY LITTLE PHIL SAT NEXT ON THE ROOF TO CLOVER AND SHE HELD HIM TIGHT WITH HER ARM
104-132091-0042 THEN CAME ELSIE A THIN BROWN CHILD OF EIGHT WITH BEAUTIFUL DARK EYES AND CRISP SHORT CURLS COVERING THE WHOLE OF HER SMALL HEAD POOR LITTLE ELSIE WAS THE ODD ONE AMONG THE CARRS
104-132091-0043 SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO BELONG EXACTLY TO EITHER THE OLDER OR THE YOUNGER CHILDREN THE GREAT DESIRE AND AMBITION OF HER HEART
104-132091-0044 THEY WERE FOREVER ESTABLISHING IN ALL SORTS OF HIDDEN PLACES BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT ELSIE AND USED TO TELL HER TO RUN AWAY AND PLAY WITH THE CHILDREN WHICH HURT HER FEELINGS VERY MUCH WHEN SHE WOULDN'T RUN AWAY
104-132091-0045 I AM SORRY TO SAY THEY RAN AWAY FROM HER WHICH AS THEIR LEGS WERE LONGEST IT WAS EASY TO DO
104-132091-0046 LEFT BEHIND WOULD CRY BITTER TEARS AND AS SHE WAS TOO PROUD TO PLAY MUCH WITH DORRY AND JOHN HER PRINCIPAL COMFORT WAS TRACKING THE OLDER ONES ABOUT AND DISCOVERING THEIR MYSTERIES ESPECIALLY THE POST OFFICES
104-132091-0047 WHICH WERE HER GREATEST GRIEVANCE HER EYES WERE BRIGHT AND QUICK AS A BIRD'S SHE WOULD PEEP AND PEER AND FOLLOW AND WATCH TILL AT LAST IN SOME ODD UNLIKELY PLACE THE CROTCH OF A TREE
104-132091-0048 OR PERHAPS ON THE VERY TOP STEP OF THE SCUTTLE LADDER SHE SPIED THE LITTLE PAPER BOX WITH ITS LOAD OF NOTES ALL ENDING WITH BE SURE AND NOT LET ELSIE KNOW THEN SHE WOULD SEIZE THE BOX AND MARCHING UP TO WHEREVER THE OTHERS WERE
104-132091-0049 THERE'S YOUR OLD POST OFFICE BUT FEELING ALL THE TIME JUST LIKE CRYING POOR LITTLE ELSIE IN ALMOST EVERY BIG FAMILY THERE IS ONE OF THESE UNMATED LEFT OUT CHILDREN KATY
104-132091-0050 AND OF USE NEVER SAW AS SHE DRIFTED ON HER HEEDLESS WAY THAT HERE IN THIS LONELY LITTLE SISTER WAS THE VERY CHANCE SHE WANTED FOR BEING A COMFORT TO SOMEBODY WHO NEEDED COMFORT VERY MUCH SHE NEVER SAW IT
104-132091-0051 AND ELSIE'S HEAVY HEART WENT UNCHEERED DORRY AND JOANNA SAT ON THE TWO ENDS OF THE RIDGE POLE DORRY WAS SIX YEARS OLD A PALE PUDGY BOY WITH RATHER A SOLEMN FACE
104-132091-0052 WHICH ALWAYS LOOKED READY TO LAUGH THESE TWO WERE GREAT FRIENDS THOUGH DORRY SEEMED LIKE A GIRL WHO HAD GOT INTO BOY'S CLOTHES BY MISTAKE AND JOHNNIE LIKE A BOY WHO IN A FIT OF FUN HAD BORROWED HIS SISTER'S FROCK
104-132091-0053 THE WINDOW ABOVE OPENED A GLAD SHRIEK WAS HEARD AND KATY'S HEAD APPEARED
104-132091-0054 WHICH SHE WAVED TRIUMPHANTLY HURRAY SHE CRIED ALL DONE AND AUNT IZZIE SAYS WE MAY GO ARE YOU TIRED OUT WAITING
104-132091-0055 HURRY UP CLOVER AND GET THE THINGS CECY AND I WILL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE THE CHILDREN JUMPED UP GLADLY AND SLID DOWN THE ROOF CLOVER FETCHED A COUPLE OF BASKETS FROM THE WOOD SHED ELSIE RAN FOR HER KITTEN
104-132091-0056 JUST AS THEY WERE READY THE SIDE DOOR BANGED AND KATY AND CECY HALL CAME INTO THE YARD I MUST TELL YOU ABOUT CECY SHE WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF THE CHILDREN'S AND LIVED IN A HOUSE NEXT DOOR
104-132091-0057 THE YARDS OF THE HOUSES WERE ONLY SEPARATED BY A GREEN HEDGE WITH NO GATE SO THAT CECY SPENT TWO THIRDS OF HER TIME AT DOCTOR CARR'S
104-132091-0058 SHE WAS A NEAT DAPPER PINK AND WHITE GIRL MODEST AND PRIM IN MANNER WITH LIGHT SHINY HAIR WHICH ALWAYS KEPT SMOOTH AND SLIM HANDS WHICH NEVER LOOKED DIRTY
104-132091-0059 SHE WAS AS HEEDLESS AND INNOCENT AS A CHILD OF SIX
104-132091-0060 WHAT SHE DID TO MAKE HERSELF GROW SO NOBODY COULD TELL BUT THERE SHE WAS UP ABOVE PAPA'S EAR AND HALF A HEAD TALLER THAN POOR AUNT IZZIE WHENEVER SHE STOPPED TO THINK ABOUT HER HEIGHT SHE BECAME VERY AWKWARD
104-132091-0061 AND FELT AS IF SHE WERE ALL LEGS AND ELBOWS AND ANGLES AND JOINTS HAPPILY HER HEAD WAS SO FULL OF OTHER THINGS OF PLANS AND SCHEMES AND FANCIES OF ALL SORTS THAT SHE DIDN'T OFTEN TAKE TIME TO REMEMBER HOW TALL SHE WAS
104-132091-0062 SHE WAS A DEAR LOVING CHILD FOR ALL HER CARELESS HABITS AND MADE BUSHELS OF GOOD RESOLUTIONS EVERY WEEK OF HER LIFE ONLY UNLUCKILY SHE NEVER KEPT ANY OF THEM SHE HAD FITS OF RESPONSIBILITY ABOUT THE OTHER CHILDREN
104-132091-0063 AND LONGED TO SET THEM A GOOD EXAMPLE BUT WHEN THE CHANCE CAME SHE GENERALLY FORGOT TO DO SO KATY'S DAYS FLEW LIKE THE WIND FOR WHEN SHE WASN'T STUDYING LESSONS OR SEWING AND DARNING WITH AUNT IZZIE WHICH SHE HATED EXTREMELY
104-132091-0064 THERE WERE ALWAYS SO MANY DELIGHTFUL SCHEMES RIOTING IN HER BRAINS
104-132091-0065 THESE SAME ACTIVE BRAINS GOT HER INTO PERPETUAL SCRAPES SHE WAS FOND OF BUILDING CASTLES IN THE AIR
