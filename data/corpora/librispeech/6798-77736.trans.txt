6798-77736-0000 WHILE POLAND SUFFERS AND DREAMS OF LIBERATION WHILE SERBIA IS WAITING FOR REDEMPTION THERE IS A LITTLE COUNTRY THE SOUL OF WHICH IS TORN TO PIECES A LITTLE COUNTRY THAT IS SO REMOTE SO REMOTE THAT HER ARDENT SIGHS CANNOT BE HEARD
6798-77736-0001 THE COUNTRY THAT SAW ABRAHAM BUILD THE ALTAR UPON WHICH HE WAS READY TO IMMOLATE HIS ONLY SON THE COUNTRY THAT MOSES SAW FROM A DISTANCE STRETCHING IN BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS A LAND OF PROMISE NEVER TO BE ATTAINED THE COUNTRY
6798-77736-0002 THAT GAVE THE WORLD ITS SYMBOLS OF SOUL AND SPIRIT PALESTINE NO WAR CORRESPONDENTS NO RED CROSS OR RELIEF COMMITTEES HAVE GONE TO PALESTINE BECAUSE NO ACTUAL FIGHTING HAS TAKEN PLACE THERE
6798-77736-0003 AND YET HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ARE SUFFERING THERE THAT WORST OF AGONIES THE AGONY OF THE SPIRIT THOSE WHO HAVE DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO SHOW THE WORLD THAT PALESTINE CAN BE MADE AGAIN A COUNTRY FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY
6798-77736-0004 THOSE WHO HAVE DREAMED OF REVIVING THE SPIRIT OF THE PROPHETS AND THE GREAT TEACHERS ARE HANGED AND PERSECUTED AND EXILED THEIR DREAMS SHATTERED THEIR HOLY PLACES PROFANED THEIR WORK RUINED
6798-77736-0005 CUT OFF FROM THE WORLD WITH NO BREAD TO SUSTAIN THE STARVING BODY
6798-77736-0006 OF A BARBARIAN SOLDIERY TRAMPLING THEIR VERY SOUL THE DREAMERS OF PALESTINE REFUSE TO SURRENDER AND AMIDST THE CLASH OF GUNS AND SWORDS THEY ARE BATTLING FOR THE SPIRIT WITH THE WEAPONS OF THE SPIRIT
6798-77736-0007 THE TIME HAS NOT YET COME TO WRITE THE RECORD OF THESE BATTLES
6798-77736-0008 IN THAT FERTILE COASTAL REGION CLOSE TO THE ANCIENT PLAINS OF ARMAGEDDON
6798-77736-0009 I WAS BORN MY CHILDHOOD WAS PASSED HERE IN THE PEACE AND HARMONY OF THIS LITTLE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY
6798-77736-0010 AGAINST THE NATIVE ARABS WHO AT FIRST MENACED THE LIFE OF THE NEW COLONY THE VILLAGE WAS FAR MORE SUGGESTIVE OF SWITZERLAND THAN OF THE CONVENTIONAL SLOVENLY VILLAGES OF THE EAST MUD BUILT AND FILTHY
6798-77736-0011 FOR WHILE IT WAS THE PURPOSE OF OUR PEOPLE IN RETURNING TO THE HOLY LAND TO FOSTER THE JEWISH LANGUAGE
6798-77736-0012 DRY FARMING WHICH SOME PEOPLE CONSIDER A RECENT DISCOVERY
6798-77736-0013 WAS INTRODUCED AND EXTENDED WITH AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS BLOODED CATTLE WERE IMPORTED AND POULTRY RAISING ON A LARGE SCALE WAS UNDERTAKEN WITH THE AID OF INCUBATORS TO THE DISGUST OF THE ARABS WHO LOOK
6798-77736-0014 AS AGAINST NATURE AND SINFUL OUR PEOPLE REPLACED THE WRETCHED NATIVE TRAILS WITH GOOD ROADS BORDERED BY HEDGES OF THORNY ACACIA WHICH IN SEASON WERE COVERED WITH DOWNY LITTLE YELLOW BLOSSOMS
6798-77736-0015 THAT SMELLED SWEETER THAN HONEY WHEN THE SUN WAS ON THEM
6798-77736-0016 AS SHUT UP IN HAREMS A SHORT EXPERIENCE WITH TURKISH COURTS AND TURKISH JUSTICE TAUGHT OUR PEOPLE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO ESTABLISH A LEGAL SYSTEM OF THEIR OWN
6798-77736-0017 ONE TO INTERPRET THE MOSAIC LAW ANOTHER
6798-77736-0018 ALL JEWISH DISPUTES WERE SETTLED BY THIS COURT ITS EFFECTIVENESS MAY BE JUDGED BY THE FACT THAT THE ARABS
6798-77736-0019 BEGAN IN INCREASING NUMBERS TO BRING THEIR DIFFICULTIES TO OUR TRIBUNAL JEWS
6798-77736-0020 ZICRON JACOB
6798-77736-0021 WHEN IN NINETEEN TEN ON THE ADVICE OF MY ELDER BROTHER
6798-77736-0022 AT ATHLIT AN ANCIENT TOWN OF THE CRUSADERS I LEFT FOR AMERICA TO ENTER THE SERVICE OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE A FEW DAYS AFTER REACHING THIS COUNTRY
6798-77736-0023 I TOOK OUT MY FIRST NATURALIZATION PAPERS AND PROCEEDED TO WASHINGTON WHERE I BECAME PART OF THAT GREAT GOVERNMENT SERVICE WHOSE BENEFICENT ACTIVITY IS TOO LITTLE KNOWN BY AMERICANS
6798-77736-0024 AND STEREOPTICON VIEWS THESE I INTENDED TO USE IN A LECTURING TOUR
6798-77736-0025 DURING THE YEARS OF MY RESIDENCE IN AMERICA I WAS ABLE TO APPRECIATE AND JUDGE IN THEIR RIGHT VALUE
6798-77736-0026 WHICH MY PEOPLE LED IN THE HOLY LAND FROM A DISTANCE TOO I SAW BETTER THE NEED FOR ORGANIZATION AMONG OUR COMMUNITIES
6798-77736-0027 ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TWO MONTHS AFTER MY RETURN FROM AMERICA AN EVENT OCCURRED WHICH GAVE IMPETUS TO THESE PROJECTS THE PHYSICIAN OF OUR VILLAGE AN OLD MAN WHO HAD DEVOTED HIS ENTIRE LIFE TO SERVING
6798-77736-0028 AND HEALING THE PEOPLE OF PALESTINE WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF RACE OR RELIGION WAS DRIVING HOME ONE EVENING IN HIS CARRIAGE FROM A NEIGHBORING SETTLEMENT WITH HIM WAS A YOUNG GIRL OF SIXTEEN IN A DESERTED PLACE
6798-77736-0029 THEY WERE SET UPON BY FOUR ARMED ARABS WHO BEAT THE OLD MAN TO UNCONSCIOUSNESS AS HE TRIED IN VAIN TO DEFEND THE GIRL FROM THE TERRIBLE FATE WHICH AWAITED HER NIGHT CAME ON
6798-77736-0030 WITH TRAGEDY CLOSE AT HAND I MADE MY COMRADES TAKE OATH ON THE HONOR OF THEIR SISTERS TO ORGANIZE THEMSELVES INTO A STRONG SOCIETY FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE LIFE AND HONOR OF OUR VILLAGERS AND
6798-77736-0031 OF OUR PEOPLE AT LARGE THESE DETAILS
6798-77736-0032 OF THE DISTURBANCES THAT CAME THICK AND FAST WHEN IN AUGUST NINETEEN FOURTEEN
6798-77736-0033 WAS AT ONCE FELT EVEN IN OUR REMOTE CORNER OF THE EARTH SOON AFTER THE GERMAN INVASION OF BELGIUM THE TURKISH ARMY WAS MOBILIZED AND ALL CITIZENS OF THE EMPIRE BETWEEN NINETEEN AND FORTY FIVE YEARS
6798-77736-0034 WERE CALLED TO THE COLORS AS THE YOUNG TURK CONSTITUTION OF NINETEEN O NINE PROVIDED THAT ALL CHRISTIANS AND JEWS WERE EQUALLY LIABLE TO MILITARY SERVICE
6798-77736-0035 OUR YOUNG MEN KNEW THAT THEY TOO WOULD BE CALLED UPON TO MAKE THE COMMON SACRIFICE FOR THE MOST PART THEY WERE NOT UNWILLING TO SUSTAIN THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT WHILE THE CONSTITUTION IMPOSED ON THEM THE BURDEN OF MILITARISM
6798-77736-0036 IT HAD BROUGHT WITH IT THE COMPENSATION OF FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND EQUAL RIGHTS AND WE COULD NOT FORGET THAT FOR SIX HUNDRED YEARS TURKEY
6798-77736-0037 AND SIMILAR MINISTRATIONS OF OTHER CIVILIZED COUNTRIES OF COURSE WE NEVER DREAMED THAT TURKEY WOULD DO ANYTHING BUT REMAIN NEUTRAL
6798-77736-0038 THINGS WERE ULTIMATELY TO TAKE WE SHOULD HAVE GIVEN A DIFFERENT GREETING TO THE MOUCHTAR OR SHERIFF WHO CAME TO OUR VILLAGE WITH THE LIST OF MOBILIZABLE MEN TO BE CALLED ON FOR SERVICE MY OWN POSITION WAS A CURIOUS ONE
6798-77736-0039 I HAD EVERY INTENTION OF COMPLETING THE PROCESS OF BECOMING AN AMERICAN CITIZEN WHICH I HAD BEGUN BY TAKING OUT FIRST PAPERS IN THE EYES OF THE LAW HOWEVER I WAS STILL A TURKISH SUBJECT WITH NO CLAIM TO AMERICAN PROTECTION
6798-77736-0040 BY THE AMERICAN CONSUL AT HAIFA WHO HAPPENS TO BE A GERMAN
