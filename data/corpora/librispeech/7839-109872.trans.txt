7839-109872-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED TWO BROTHERS WHO WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN WERE SO SELDOM APART THAT THOSE WHO SAW ONE ALWAYS LOOKED FOR THE OTHER AT HIS HEELS BUT WHEN THEY HAD GROWN TO MANHOOD
7839-109872-0001 AND THE TIME HAD COME WHEN THEY MUST MAKE THEIR OWN FORTUNES THE ELDER BROTHER SAID TO THE YOUNGER CHOOSE AS YOU WILL WHAT YOU SHALL DO AND GOD BLESS YOUR CHOICE BUT AS FOR ME I SHALL MAKE HASTE TO THE COURT OF THE KING
7839-109872-0002 FOR NOTHING WILL SATISFY ME BUT TO SERVE HIM AND MY COUNTRY GOOD FORTUNE AND A BLESSING GO WITH YOU SAID THE YOUNGER BROTHER I TOO SHOULD LIKE TO SERVE MY COUNTRY AND THE KING BUT I HAVE NEITHER WORDS NOR WIT FOR A KING'S COURT
7839-109872-0003 TO HAMMER A SHOE FROM THE GLOWING IRON WHILE THE RED FIRE ROARS AND THE ANVIL RINGS THIS IS THE WORK THAT I DO BEST AND I SHALL BE A BLACKSMITH EVEN AS MY FATHER WAS BEFORE ME SO WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN
7839-109872-0004 AND WORKED THERE MERRILY FROM EARLY MORN TILL THE STARS SHONE AT NIGHT HE WAS CALLED THE MIGHTY BLACKSMITH BECAUSE OF HIS STRENGTH AND THE HONEST BLACKSMITH BECAUSE HE CHARGED NO MORE THAN HIS WORK WAS WORTH AND THE MASTER BLACKSMITH
7839-109872-0005 BECAUSE NO OTHER SMITH IN THE COUNTRYSIDE COULD SHOE A HORSE SO WELL AND SPEEDILY AS HE AND HE WAS ENVIOUS OF NOBODY FOR ALWAYS AS HE WORKED HIS HAMMER SEEMED TO SING TO HIM CLING CLANG CLING
7839-109872-0006 CLING CLANG CLING HE WHO DOES HIS VERY BEST IS FIT TO SERVE THE KING NOW IN THOSE DAYS NEWS CAME TO THE KING OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THE TWO BROTHERS LIVED THAT THE DUKE OF THE NEXT KINGDOM HAD MADE THREATS AGAINST HIM
7839-109872-0007 AND AGAINST HIS PEOPLE AND THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT IN THE LAND SOME OF THE KING'S COUNSELORS WANTED HIM TO GATHER HIS ARMIES AND MARCH AT ONCE INTO THE DUKE'S KINGDOM IF WE DO NOT MAKE WAR UPON HIM
7839-109872-0008 HE WILL MAKE WAR UPON US THEY SAID BUT SOME OF THE KING'S COUNSELORS LOVED PEACE AND AMONG THESE WAS THE ELDER BROTHER IN WHOM THE KING HAD GREAT TRUST
7839-109872-0009 LET ME I PRAY YOU RIDE TO THE DUKE'S CASTLE HE SAID TO THE KING THAT WE MAY LEARN FROM HIS OWN LIPS IF HE IS FRIEND OR FOE FOR MUCH IS TOLD THAT IS NOT TRUE
7839-109872-0010 AND IT IS EASIER TO BEGIN A FIGHT THAN IT IS TO END ONE THE KING WAS WELL PLEASED WITH ALL THE ELDER BROTHER SAID AND BADE HIM GO BUT IF BY THE PEAL OF THE NOON BELLS ON THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS
7839-109872-0011 YOU HAVE NEITHER BROUGHT NOR SENT A MESSAGE OF GOOD WILL FROM THE DUKE TO ME THEN SHALL THOSE WHO WANT WAR HAVE THEIR WAY HE SAID AND WITH THIS THE ELDER BROTHER HAD TO BE CONTENT
7839-109872-0012 DAY AND NIGHT HE RODE TO THE DUKE'S CASTLE AND DAY AND NIGHT WHEN HIS ERRAND WAS DONE HE HASTENED HOME AGAIN BUT THE WAY WAS LONG AND A STRONG WIND HAD BLOWN AWAY THE SIGN POSTS WHICH GUIDED TRAVELERS
7839-109872-0013 THE EARLY HOURS OF THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS FOUND HIM STILL FAR FROM THE KING'S PALACE AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE IN THE LONELIEST PART OF THE ROAD THE GOOD HORSE THAT HAD CARRIED HIM SO WELL LOST A SHOE
7839-109872-0014 ALACK AND ALAS FOR THE WANT OF A NAIL THE HORSESHOE IS LOST AND MY GOOD HORSE WILL FAIL FOR THE WANT OF THE SHOE AND I SHALL BE LATE FOR WANT OF A STEED
7839-109872-0015 AND MY MESSAGE MUST WAIT FOR WANT OF A BEARER AND WOE IS OUR PLIGHT
7839-109872-0016 AND HE BOWED HIS HEAD UPON HIS SADDLE AND WEPT FOR WHERE TO TURN FOR HELP HE DID NOT KNOW THE SUN HAD NOT YET RISEN AND NO OTHER TRAVELER WAS ON THE ROAD NOR COULD HE SEE THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT OF DAWN
7839-109872-0017 SMITH IF YOU LOVE COUNTRY AND KING SHOE MY HORSE AND SHOE HIM SPEEDILY IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE SPIED THE FIRE OF A ROADSIDE SMITHY GLARING OUT UPON HIM LIKE A GREAT RED EYE AND WHEN HE REACHED THE DOOR OF THE SHOP
7839-109872-0018 HE FOUND THE SMITH READY AND WAITING FOR HIS TASK CLING CLANG CLING HOW THE IRON RANG BENEATH HIS MIGHTY STROKE AND CLING CLANG CLING HOW THE HAMMER SANG AS THE SHOE WAS POUNDED INTO SHAPE
7839-109872-0019 AND HE STOOD UP STRAIGHT AND TALL AND LOOKED THE KING'S COUNSELOR IN THE EYES AND LO AND BEHOLD AS THE MORNING LIGHT FELL ON THEIR FACES EACH SAW THAT THE OTHER WAS HIS BROTHER GOD BLESS YOU BROTHER
7839-109872-0020 AND GOD SPEED YOU BROTHER WAS ALL THAT THEY HAD TIME TO SAY BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH TO SHOW THAT LOVE WAS STILL WARM IN THEIR HEARTS THEN AWAY AND AWAY AND AWAY THROUGH THE SUN AND THE DEW RODE THE ELDER BROTHER
7839-109872-0021 THOSE WHO WANTED WAR SAID SHALL WE NOT SADDLE OUR HORSES AND CALL UP OUR MEN THE BELLS IN THE STEEPLE HAVE YET TO RING FOR NOON SAID THE PEACE LOVERS AND WE SEE A DUST ON THE KING'S HIGHWAY
7839-109872-0022 DUST FLIES BEFORE WIND SAID THE WARRIORS AND IT IS LIKELIER THAT OUR MESSENGER LIES IN THE DUKE'S PRISON THAN RIDES ON THE KING'S HIGHWAY BUT WITH THE DUST CAME THE SOUND OF FLYING HOOFS FASTER
7839-109872-0023 FASTER FASTER THEY CAME WHEN THE FIRST STROKE OF THE NOON HOUR PEALED FROM THE CHURCH STEEPLE THE KING'S MESSENGER WAS IN SIGHT AND THE LAST BELL HAD NOT RUNG WHEN HE STOOD BEFORE THE PALACE GATE
7839-109872-0024 AND PUT A PURSE OF GOLD IN HIS HAND FOR HE WAS WELL PLEASED WITH WHAT HE HAD DONE BUT THE ELDER BROTHER WOULD HAVE NONE OF THESE THINGS FOR HIMSELF ALONE TRY AS I WOULD I MUST HAVE FAILED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR MY BROTHER
7839-109872-0025 THE BLACKSMITH WHO SHOD MY HORSE ON THE ROAD TO DAY HE SAID AND IF IT PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY HALF OF ALL YOU GIVE TO ME I WILL GIVE TO HIM TWO GOOD SERVANTS ARE BETTER THAN ONE SAID THE KING
7839-109872-0026 AND HE SENT FOR THE YOUNGER BROTHER THAT HE MIGHT THANK HIM ALSO THEN THE TWO BROTHERS WERE CLOTHED ALIKE AND FEASTED ALIKE AND EACH HAD A PURSE OF GOLD AND WHENEVER ONE WAS PRAISED SO WAS THE OTHER
