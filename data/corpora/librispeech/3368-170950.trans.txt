3368-170950-0000 WHERE THEN IS JUSTICE AND WHERE IS INJUSTICE AND IN WHAT PART OF THE STATE DID THEY SPRING UP PROBABLY IN THE DEALINGS OF THESE CITIZENS WITH ONE ANOTHER I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE FOUND ANY WHERE ELSE
3368-170950-0001 I DARE SAY THAT YOU ARE RIGHT IN YOUR SUGGESTION I SAID WE HAD BETTER THINK THE MATTER OUT AND NOT SHRINK FROM THE ENQUIRY
3368-170950-0002 NOW THAT WE HAVE THUS ESTABLISHED THEM
3368-170950-0003 STRIPPED AND BAREFOOT BUT IN WINTER SUBSTANTIALLY CLOTHED AND SHOD THEY WILL FEED ON BARLEY MEAL AND FLOUR OF WHEAT
3368-170950-0004 AND THEY AND THEIR CHILDREN WILL FEAST DRINKING OF THE WINE WHICH THEY HAVE MADE WEARING GARLANDS ON THEIR HEADS
3368-170950-0005 AND IF YOU WERE PROVIDING FOR A CITY OF PIGS HOW ELSE WOULD YOU FEED THE BEASTS BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE GLAUCON I REPLIED WHY HE SAID YOU SHOULD GIVE THEM THE ORDINARY CONVENIENCES OF LIFE PEOPLE WHO ARE TO BE COMFORTABLE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO LIE ON SOFAS
3368-170950-0006 AND DINE OFF TABLES AND THEY SHOULD HAVE SAUCES AND SWEETS IN THE MODERN STYLE YES I SAID NOW I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION WHICH YOU WOULD HAVE ME CONSIDER IS NOT ONLY HOW A STATE BUT HOW A LUXURIOUS STATE IS CREATED AND POSSIBLY THERE IS NO HARM IN THIS
3368-170950-0007 ALL THESE NOT OF ONE SORT ONLY BUT IN EVERY VARIETY
3368-170950-0008 AND GOLD AND IVORY AND ALL SORTS OF MATERIALS MUST BE PROCURED TRUE HE SAID

3368-170950-0012 AND THE COUNTRY WHICH WAS ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL INHABITANTS WILL BE TOO SMALL NOW AND NOT ENOUGH QUITE TRUE THEN A SLICE OF OUR NEIGHBOURS LAND WILL BE WANTED BY US FOR PASTURE AND TILLAGE AND THEY WILL WANT A SLICE OF OURS IF LIKE OURSELVES THEY EXCEED THE LIMIT OF NECESSITY
3368-170950-0013 WHICH WILL HAVE TO GO OUT AND FIGHT WITH THE INVADERS FOR ALL THAT WE HAVE
3368-170950-0014 WHY HE SAID ARE THEY NOT CAPABLE OF DEFENDING THEMSELVES NO I SAID NOT IF WE WERE RIGHT IN THE PRINCIPLE WHICH WAS ACKNOWLEDGED BY ALL OF US WHEN WE WERE FRAMING THE STATE THE PRINCIPLE AS YOU WILL REMEMBER WAS THAT ONE MAN CANNOT PRACTISE MANY ARTS WITH SUCCESS
3368-170950-0015 BUT TO HIM AND TO EVERY OTHER WORKER WAS ASSIGNED ONE WORK FOR WHICH HE WAS BY NATURE FITTED AND AT THAT HE WAS TO CONTINUE WORKING ALL HIS LIFE LONG AND AT NO OTHER HE WAS NOT TO LET OPPORTUNITIES SLIP AND THEN HE WOULD BECOME A GOOD WORKMAN
3368-170950-0016 OR MASTER OF DEFENCE NOR BE OF ANY USE TO HIM WHO HAS NOT LEARNED HOW TO HANDLE THEM AND HAS NEVER BESTOWED ANY ATTENTION UPON THEM HOW THEN WILL HE WHO TAKES UP A SHIELD OR OTHER IMPLEMENT OF WAR BECOME A GOOD FIGHTER ALL IN A DAY WHETHER WITH HEAVY ARMED OR ANY OTHER KIND OF TROOPS
3368-170950-0017 NOT ALSO REQUIRE NATURAL APTITUDE FOR HIS CALLING CERTAINLY THEN IT WILL BE OUR DUTY TO SELECT IF WE CAN NATURES WHICH ARE FITTED FOR THE TASK OF GUARDING THE CITY IT WILL AND THE SELECTION WILL BE NO EASY MATTER I SAID BUT WE MUST BE BRAVE AND DO OUR BEST
3368-170950-0018 WE MUST IS NOT THE NOBLE YOUTH VERY LIKE A WELL BRED DOG IN RESPECT OF GUARDING AND WATCHING
3368-170950-0019 AND YOUR GUARDIAN MUST BE BRAVE IF HE IS TO FIGHT WELL
3368-170950-0020 AND IS HE LIKELY TO BE BRAVE WHO HAS NO SPIRIT WHETHER HORSE OR DOG OR ANY OTHER ANIMAL HAVE YOU NEVER OBSERVED HOW INVINCIBLE AND UNCONQUERABLE IS SPIRIT AND HOW THE PRESENCE OF IT MAKES THE SOUL OF ANY CREATURE TO BE ABSOLUTELY FEARLESS AND INDOMITABLE I HAVE
3368-170950-0021 TRUE AND ALSO OF THE MENTAL ONES HIS SOUL IS TO BE FULL OF SPIRIT YES BUT ARE NOT THESE SPIRITED NATURES APT TO BE SAVAGE WITH ONE ANOTHER AND WITH EVERYBODY ELSE A DIFFICULTY BY NO MEANS EASY TO OVERCOME HE REPLIED WHEREAS I SAID
3368-170950-0022 FOR THE ONE IS THE CONTRADICTION OF THE OTHER TRUE
3368-170950-0023 AND YET THE COMBINATION OF THEM APPEARS TO BE IMPOSSIBLE AND HENCE WE MUST INFER THAT TO BE A GOOD GUARDIAN IS IMPOSSIBLE I AM AFRAID THAT WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE HE REPLIED HERE FEELING PERPLEXED I BEGAN TO THINK OVER WHAT HAD PRECEDED MY FRIEND I SAID
3368-170950-0024 NO WONDER THAT WE ARE IN A PERPLEXITY FOR WE HAVE LOST SIGHT OF THE IMAGE WHICH WE HAD BEFORE US
3368-170950-0025 AND WHERE DO YOU FIND THEM MANY ANIMALS I REPLIED FURNISH EXAMPLES OF THEM OUR FRIEND THE DOG IS A VERY GOOD ONE YOU KNOW THAT WELL BRED DOGS ARE PERFECTLY GENTLE TO THEIR FAMILIARS AND ACQUAINTANCES AND THE REVERSE TO STRANGERS YES I KNOW
3368-170950-0026 I DO NOT APPREHEND YOUR MEANING THE TRAIT OF WHICH I AM SPEAKING I REPLIED MAY BE ALSO SEEN IN THE DOG AND IS REMARKABLE IN THE ANIMAL WHAT TRAIT WHY A DOG WHENEVER HE SEES A STRANGER IS ANGRY WHEN AN ACQUAINTANCE HE WELCOMES HIM
3368-170950-0027 ALTHOUGH THE ONE HAS NEVER DONE HIM ANY HARM NOR THE OTHER ANY GOOD DID THIS NEVER STRIKE YOU AS CURIOUS THE MATTER NEVER STRUCK ME BEFORE BUT I QUITE RECOGNISE THE TRUTH OF YOUR REMARK AND SURELY THIS INSTINCT OF THE DOG IS VERY CHARMING
3368-170950-0028 AND MUST NOT AN ANIMAL BE A LOVER OF LEARNING WHO DETERMINES WHAT HE LIKES AND DISLIKES BY THE TEST OF KNOWLEDGE AND IGNORANCE MOST ASSUREDLY
3368-170950-0029 HOW DO JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE GROW UP IN STATES
