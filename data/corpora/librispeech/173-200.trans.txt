173-200-0000 EVERY MORNING NOW BROUGHT ITS REGULAR DUTIES SHOPS WERE TO BE VISITED SOME NEW PART OF THE TOWN TO BE LOOKED AT AND THE PUMP ROOM TO BE ATTENDED WHERE THEY PARADED UP AND DOWN FOR AN HOUR
173-200-0001 LOOKING AT EVERYBODY AND SPEAKING TO NO ONE THE WISH OF A NUMEROUS ACQUAINTANCE IN BATH WAS STILL UPPERMOST WITH MISSUS ALLEN
173-200-0002 AND SHE REPEATED IT AFTER EVERY FRESH PROOF WHICH EVERY MORNING BROUGHT OF HER KNOWING NOBODY AT ALL THEY MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN THE LOWER ROOMS AND HERE FORTUNE WAS MORE FAVOURABLE TO OUR HEROINE
173-200-0003 THE MASTER OF THE CEREMONIES INTRODUCED TO HER A VERY GENTLEMANLIKE YOUNG MAN AS A PARTNER HIS NAME WAS TILNEY HE SEEMED TO BE ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE AND TWENTY
173-200-0004 WAS RATHER TALL HAD A PLEASING COUNTENANCE A VERY INTELLIGENT AND LIVELY EYE AND IF NOT QUITE HANDSOME WAS VERY NEAR IT HIS ADDRESS WAS GOOD
173-200-0005 AND CATHERINE FELT HERSELF IN HIGH LUCK THERE WAS LITTLE LEISURE FOR SPEAKING WHILE THEY DANCED BUT WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TEA SHE FOUND HIM AS AGREEABLE AS SHE HAD ALREADY GIVEN HIM CREDIT FOR BEING
173-200-0006 HE TALKED WITH FLUENCY AND SPIRIT AND THERE WAS AN ARCHNESS AND PLEASANTRY IN HIS MANNER WHICH INTERESTED THOUGH IT WAS HARDLY UNDERSTOOD BY HER
173-200-0007 AFTER CHATTING SOME TIME ON SUCH MATTERS AS NATURALLY AROSE FROM THE OBJECTS AROUND THEM HE SUDDENLY ADDRESSED HER WITH I HAVE HITHERTO BEEN VERY REMISS MADAM
173-200-0008 IN THE PROPER ATTENTIONS OF A PARTNER HERE I HAVE NOT YET ASKED YOU HOW LONG YOU HAVE BEEN IN BATH WHETHER YOU WERE EVER HERE BEFORE WHETHER YOU HAVE BEEN AT THE UPPER ROOMS THE THEATRE AND THE CONCERT
173-200-0009 AND HOW YOU LIKE THE PLACE ALTOGETHER I HAVE BEEN VERY NEGLIGENT BUT ARE YOU NOW AT LEISURE TO SATISFY ME IN THESE PARTICULARS IF YOU ARE I WILL BEGIN DIRECTLY
173-200-0010 YOU NEED NOT GIVE YOURSELF THAT TROUBLE SIR NO TROUBLE I ASSURE YOU MADAM THEN FORMING HIS FEATURES INTO A SET SMILE AND AFFECTEDLY SOFTENING HIS VOICE HE ADDED WITH A SIMPERING AIR
173-200-0011 ABOUT A WEEK SIR REPLIED CATHERINE TRYING NOT TO LAUGH REALLY WITH AFFECTED ASTONISHMENT WHY SHOULD YOU BE SURPRISED SIR
173-200-0012 WHY INDEED SAID HE IN HIS NATURAL TONE BUT SOME EMOTION MUST APPEAR TO BE RAISED BY YOUR REPLY AND SURPRISE IS MORE EASILY ASSUMED AND NOT LESS REASONABLE THAN ANY OTHER NOW LET US GO ON
173-200-0013 NEVER SIR INDEED
173-200-0014 YES SIR I WAS THERE LAST MONDAY HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE THEATRE YES SIR I WAS AT THE PLAY ON TUESDAY TO THE CONCERT YES SIR
173-200-0015 YES I LIKE IT VERY WELL NOW I MUST GIVE ONE SMIRK AND THEN WE MAY BE RATIONAL AGAIN CATHERINE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD NOT KNOWING WHETHER SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO LAUGH
173-200-0016 I SEE WHAT YOU THINK OF ME SAID HE GRAVELY I SHALL MAKE BUT A POOR FIGURE IN YOUR JOURNAL TOMORROW MY JOURNAL YES I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WILL SAY
173-200-0017 FRIDAY WENT TO THE LOWER ROOMS WORE MY SPRIGGED MUSLIN ROBE WITH BLUE TRIMMINGS PLAIN BLACK SHOES APPEARED TO MUCH ADVANTAGE
173-200-0018 BUT WAS STRANGELY HARASSED BY A QUEER HALF WITTED MAN WHO WOULD MAKE ME DANCE WITH HIM AND DISTRESSED ME BY HIS NONSENSE INDEED I SHALL SAY NO SUCH THING
173-200-0019 IF YOU PLEASE I DANCED WITH A VERY AGREEABLE YOUNG MAN INTRODUCED BY MISTER KING HAD A GREAT DEAL OF CONVERSATION WITH HIM SEEMS A MOST EXTRAORDINARY GENIUS
173-200-0020 HOPE I MAY KNOW MORE OF HIM THAT MADAM IS WHAT I WISH YOU TO SAY BUT PERHAPS I KEEP NO JOURNAL PERHAPS YOU ARE NOT SITTING IN THIS ROOM AND I AM NOT SITTING BY YOU
173-200-0021 NOT KEEP A JOURNAL HOW ARE YOUR ABSENT COUSINS TO UNDERSTAND THE TENOUR OF YOUR LIFE IN BATH WITHOUT ONE HOW ARE THE CIVILITIES AND COMPLIMENTS
173-200-0022 OF EVERY DAY TO BE RELATED AS THEY OUGHT TO BE UNLESS NOTED DOWN EVERY EVENING IN A JOURNAL HOW ARE YOUR VARIOUS DRESSES TO BE REMEMBERED AND THE PARTICULAR STATE OF YOUR COMPLEXION
173-200-0023 AND CURL OF YOUR HAIR TO BE DESCRIBED IN ALL THEIR DIVERSITIES WITHOUT HAVING CONSTANT RECOURSE TO A JOURNAL MY DEAR MADAM I AM NOT SO IGNORANT OF YOUNG LADIES WAYS AS YOU WISH TO BELIEVE ME
173-200-0024 IT IS THIS DELIGHTFUL HABIT OF JOURNALING WHICH LARGELY CONTRIBUTES TO FORM THE EASY STYLE OF WRITING FOR WHICH LADIES ARE SO GENERALLY CELEBRATED
173-200-0025 EVERYBODY ALLOWS THAT THE TALENT OF WRITING AGREEABLE LETTERS IS PECULIARLY FEMALE NATURE MAY HAVE DONE SOMETHING BUT I AM SURE IT MUST BE ESSENTIALLY ASSISTED BY THE PRACTICE OF KEEPING A JOURNAL
173-200-0026 SAID CATHERINE DOUBTINGLY WHETHER LADIES DO WRITE SO MUCH BETTER LETTERS THAN GENTLEMEN THAT IS I SHOULD NOT THINK THE SUPERIORITY WAS ALWAYS ON OUR SIDE
173-200-0027 IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THE USUAL STYLE OF LETTER WRITING AMONG WOMEN IS FAULTLESS EXCEPT IN THREE PARTICULARS AND WHAT ARE THEY A GENERAL DEFICIENCY OF SUBJECT
173-200-0028 A TOTAL INATTENTION TO STOPS AND A VERY FREQUENT IGNORANCE OF GRAMMAR UPON MY WORD I NEED NOT HAVE BEEN AFRAID OF DISCLAIMING THE COMPLIMENT YOU DO NOT THINK TOO HIGHLY OF US IN THAT WAY
173-200-0029 I SHOULD NO MORE LAY IT DOWN AS A GENERAL RULE THAT WOMEN WRITE BETTER LETTERS THAN MEN THAN THAT THEY SING BETTER DUETS OR DRAW BETTER LANDSCAPES IN EVERY POWER OF WHICH TASTE IS THE FOUNDATION
173-200-0030 EXCELLENCE IS PRETTY FAIRLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE SEXES THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY MISSUS ALLEN
173-200-0031 I AM AFRAID IT HAS TORN A HOLE ALREADY I SHALL BE QUITE SORRY IF IT HAS FOR THIS IS A FAVOURITE GOWN THOUGH IT COST BUT NINE SHILLINGS A YARD THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED IT MADAM
173-200-0032 SAID MISTER TILNEY LOOKING AT THE MUSLIN
173-200-0033 PARTICULARLY WELL I ALWAYS BUY MY OWN CRAVATS AND AM ALLOWED TO BE AN EXCELLENT JUDGE AND MY SISTER HAS OFTEN TRUSTED ME IN THE CHOICE OF A GOWN
173-200-0034 I BOUGHT ONE FOR HER THE OTHER DAY AND IT WAS PRONOUNCED TO BE A PRODIGIOUS BARGAIN BY EVERY LADY WHO SAW IT I GAVE BUT FIVE SHILLINGS A YARD FOR IT AND A TRUE INDIAN MUSLIN
173-200-0035 HOW CAN YOU SAID CATHERINE LAUGHING BE SO SHE HAD ALMOST SAID STRANGE
173-200-0036 REPLIED MISSUS ALLEN AND SO I TOLD MISS MORLAND WHEN SHE BOUGHT IT BUT THEN YOU KNOW MADAM MUSLIN ALWAYS TURNS TO SOME ACCOUNT OR OTHER MISS MORLAND WILL GET ENOUGH OUT OF IT FOR A HANDKERCHIEF
173-200-0037 OR A CAP OR A CLOAK MUSLIN CAN NEVER BE SAID TO BE WASTED I HAVE HEARD MY SISTER SAY SO FORTY TIMES WHEN SHE HAS BEEN EXTRAVAGANT IN BUYING MORE THAN SHE WANTED OR CARELESS IN CUTTING IT TO PIECES
173-200-0038 BATH IS A CHARMING PLACE SIR THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD SHOPS HERE WE ARE SADLY OFF IN THE COUNTRY NOT BUT WHAT WE HAVE VERY GOOD SHOPS IN SALISBURY
173-200-0039 MISTER ALLEN SAYS IT IS NINE MEASURED NINE BUT I AM SURE IT CANNOT BE MORE THAN EIGHT AND IT IS SUCH A FAG I COME BACK TIRED TO DEATH
173-200-0040 NOW HERE ONE CAN STEP OUT OF DOORS AND GET A THING IN FIVE MINUTES MISTER TILNEY WAS POLITE ENOUGH TO SEEM INTERESTED IN WHAT SHE SAID AND SHE KEPT HIM ON THE SUBJECT OF MUSLINS TILL THE DANCING RECOMMENCED
173-200-0041 CATHERINE FEARED AS SHE LISTENED TO THEIR DISCOURSE THAT HE INDULGED HIMSELF A LITTLE TOO MUCH WITH THE FOIBLES OF OTHERS WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF SO EARNESTLY
173-200-0042 SAID HE AS THEY WALKED BACK TO THE BALLROOM NOT OF YOUR PARTNER I HOPE FOR BY THAT SHAKE OF THE HEAD YOUR MEDITATIONS ARE NOT SATISFACTORY CATHERINE COLOURED AND SAID
173-200-0043 I WAS NOT THINKING OF ANYTHING THAT IS ARTFUL AND DEEP TO BE SURE BUT I HAD RATHER BE TOLD AT ONCE THAT YOU WILL NOT TELL ME WELL THEN I WILL NOT THANK YOU
173-200-0044 FOR NOW WE SHALL SOON BE ACQUAINTED AS I AM AUTHORIZED TO TEASE YOU ON THIS SUBJECT WHENEVER WE MEET AND NOTHING IN THE WORLD ADVANCES INTIMACY SO MUCH THEY DANCED AGAIN
173-200-0045 AND WHEN THE ASSEMBLY CLOSED PARTED ON THE LADY'S SIDE AT LEAST WITH A STRONG INCLINATION FOR CONTINUING THE ACQUAINTANCE
173-200-0046 WHETHER SHE THOUGHT OF HIM SO MUCH WHILE SHE DRANK HER WARM WINE AND WATER AND PREPARED HERSELF FOR BED AS TO DREAM OF HIM WHEN THERE CANNOT BE ASCERTAINED
173-200-0047 BUT I HOPE IT WAS NO MORE THAN IN A SLIGHT SLUMBER OR A MORNING DOZE AT MOST FOR IF IT BE TRUE AS A CELEBRATED WRITER HAS MAINTAINED
173-200-0048 THAT NO YOUNG LADY CAN BE JUSTIFIED IN FALLING IN LOVE BEFORE THE GENTLEMAN'S LOVE IS DECLARED IT MUST BE VERY IMPROPER THAT A YOUNG LADY SHOULD DREAM OF A GENTLEMAN BEFORE THE GENTLEMAN IS FIRST KNOWN TO HAVE DREAMT OF HER
173-200-0049 HOW PROPER MISTER TILNEY MIGHT BE AS A DREAMER OR A LOVER HAD NOT YET PERHAPS ENTERED MISTER ALLEN'S HEAD BUT THAT HE WAS NOT OBJECTIONABLE AS A COMMON ACQUAINTANCE FOR HIS YOUNG CHARGE
173-200-0050 HE WAS ON INQUIRY SATISFIED FOR HE HAD EARLY IN THE EVENING TAKEN PAINS TO KNOW WHO HER PARTNER WAS AND HAD BEEN ASSURED OF MISTER TILNEY'S BEING A CLERGYMAN
