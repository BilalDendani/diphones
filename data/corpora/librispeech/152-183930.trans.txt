152-183930-0000 THE GOBLINS IN THE KING'S HOUSE WHEN CURDIE FELL ASLEEP HE BEGAN AT ONCE TO DREAM HE THOUGHT HE WAS ASCENDING THE MOUNTAINSIDE FROM THE MOUTH OF THE MINE
152-183930-0001 WHEN HE CAME UPON A WOMAN AND CHILD WHO HAD LOST THEIR WAY AND FROM THAT POINT HE WENT ON DREAMING EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM SINCE HE THUS MET THE PRINCESS AND LOOTIE HOW HE HAD WATCHED THE GOBLINS HOW HE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THEM
152-183930-0002 HOW HE HAD BEEN RESCUED BY THE PRINCESS EVERYTHING INDEED UNTIL HE WAS WOUNDED CAPTURED AND IMPRISONED BY THE MEN AT ARMS AND NOW HE THOUGHT HE WAS LYING WIDE AWAKE WHERE THEY HAD LAID HIM WHEN SUDDENLY HE HEARD A GREAT THUNDERING SOUND THE COBS ARE COMING
152-183930-0003 THE COBS'LL BE CARRYING OFF THE PRINCESS FROM UNDER THEIR STUPID NOSES BUT THEY SHAN'T THAT THEY SHAN'T HE JUMPED UP AS HE THOUGHT AND BEGAN TO DRESS BUT TO HIS DISMAY FOUND THAT HE WAS STILL LYING IN BED NOW THEN I WILL
152-183930-0004 BUT YET AGAIN HE FOUND HIMSELF SNUG IN BED TWENTY TIMES HE TRIED AND TWENTY TIMES HE FAILED FOR IN FACT HE WAS NOT AWAKE ONLY DREAMING THAT HE WAS AT LENGTH IN AN AGONY OF DESPAIR
152-183930-0005 FANCYING HE HEARD THE GOBLINS ALL OVER THE HOUSE HE GAVE A GREAT CRY THEN THERE CAME AS HE THOUGHT A HAND UPON THE LOCK OF HIS DOOR IT OPENED AND LOOKING UP HE SAW A LADY WITH WHITE HAIR CARRYING A SILVER BOX IN HER HAND ENTER THE ROOM
152-183930-0006 TOOK THE DRESSING FROM HIS LEG RUBBED IT WITH SOMETHING THAT SMELT LIKE ROSES AND THEN WAVED HER HANDS OVER HIM THREE TIMES AT THE LAST WAVE OF HER HANDS EVERYTHING VANISHED HE FELT HIMSELF SINKING INTO THE PROFOUNDEST SLUMBER
152-183930-0007 THE SETTING MOON WAS THROWING A FEEBLE LIGHT THROUGH THE CASEMENT AND THE HOUSE WAS FULL OF UPROAR THERE WAS SOFT HEAVY MULTITUDINOUS STAMPING A CLASHING AND CLANGING OF WEAPONS THE VOICES OF MEN AND THE CRIES OF WOMEN MIXED WITH A HIDEOUS BELLOWING
152-183930-0008 WHICH SOUNDED VICTORIOUS THE COBS WERE IN THE HOUSE HE SPRANG FROM HIS BED HURRIED ON SOME OF HIS CLOTHES NOT FORGETTING HIS SHOES WHICH WERE ARMED WITH NAILS THEN SPYING AN OLD HUNTING KNIFE OR SHORT SWORD HANGING ON THE WALL HE CAUGHT IT
152-183930-0009 AND RUSHED DOWN THE STAIRS GUIDED BY THE SOUNDS OF STRIFE WHICH GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER WHEN HE REACHED THE GROUND FLOOR HE FOUND THE WHOLE PLACE SWARMING
152-183930-0010 HE RUSHED AMONGST THEM SHOUTING ONE TWO HIT AND HEW THREE FOUR BLAST AND BORE AND WITH EVERY RHYME HE CAME DOWN A GREAT STAMP UPON A FOOT CUTTING AT THE SAME TIME THEIR FACES EXECUTING INDEED A SWORD DANCE OF THE WILDEST DESCRIPTION
152-183930-0011 AWAY SCATTERED THE GOBLINS IN EVERY DIRECTION INTO CLOSETS UP STAIRS INTO CHIMNEYS UP ON RAFTERS AND DOWN TO THE CELLARS CURDIE WENT ON STAMPING AND SLASHING AND SINGING BUT SAW NOTHING OF THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE
152-183930-0012 UNTIL HE CAME TO THE GREAT HALL IN WHICH THE MOMENT HE ENTERED IT AROSE A GREAT GOBLIN SHOUT THE LAST OF THE MEN AT ARMS THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF WAS ON THE FLOOR BURIED BENEATH A WALLOWING CROWD OF GOBLINS
152-183930-0013 FOR HE HAD SOON FOUND THEIR HEADS ALL BUT INVULNERABLE THE QUEEN HAD ATTACKED HIS LEGS AND FEET WITH HER HORRIBLE GRANITE SHOE AND HE WAS SOON DOWN BUT THE CAPTAIN HAD GOT HIS BACK TO THE WALL AND STOOD OUT LONGER
152-183930-0014 THE GOBLINS WOULD HAVE TORN THEM ALL TO PIECES BUT THE KING HAD GIVEN ORDERS TO CARRY THEM AWAY ALIVE AND OVER EACH OF THEM IN TWELVE GROUPS WAS STANDING A KNOT OF GOBLINS WHILE AS MANY AS COULD FIND ROOM WERE SITTING UPON THEIR PROSTRATE BODIES
152-183930-0015 CURDIE BURST IN DANCING AND GYRATING AND STAMPING AND SINGING LIKE A SMALL INCARNATE WHIRLWIND
152-183930-0016 THE QUEEN GAVE A HOWL OF RAGE AND DISMAY AND BEFORE SHE RECOVERED HER PRESENCE OF MIND CURDIE HAVING BEGUN WITH THE GROUP NEAREST HIM HAD ELEVEN OF THE KNIGHTS ON THEIR LEGS AGAIN STAMP ON THEIR FEET HE CRIED AS EACH MAN ROSE
152-183930-0017 AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE HALL WAS NEARLY EMPTY THE GOBLINS RUNNING FROM IT AS FAST AS THEY COULD HOWLING AND SHRIEKING AND LIMPING AND COWERING EVERY NOW AND THEN AS THEY RAN TO CUDDLE THEIR WOUNDED FEET IN THEIR HARD HANDS OR TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE FRIGHTFUL STAMP STAMP OF THE ARMED MEN
152-183930-0018 AND NOW CURDIE APPROACHED THE GROUP WHICH IN TRUSTING IN THE QUEEN AND HER SHOE KEPT THEIR GUARD OVER THE PROSTRATE CAPTAIN
152-183930-0019 BUT THE QUEEN STOOD IN FRONT LIKE AN INFURIATED CAT WITH HER PERPENDICULAR EYES GLEAMING GREEN AND HER HAIR STANDING HALF UP FROM HER HORRID HEAD HER HEART WAS QUAKING HOWEVER AND SHE KEPT MOVING ABOUT HER SKIN SHOD FOOT WITH NERVOUS APPREHENSION
152-183930-0020 WHEN CURDIE WAS WITHIN A FEW PACES SHE RUSHED AT HIM MADE ONE TREMENDOUS STAMP AT HIS OPPOSING FOOT WHICH HAPPILY HE WITHDREW IN TIME AND CAUGHT HIM ROUND THE WAIST TO DASH HIM ON THE MARBLE FLOOR BUT JUST AS SHE CAUGHT HIM
152-183930-0021 HE CAME DOWN WITH ALL THE WEIGHT OF HIS IRON SHOD SHOE UPON HER SKIN SHOD FOOT AND WITH A HIDEOUS HOWL SHE DROPPED HIM SQUATTED ON THE FLOOR AND TOOK HER FOOT IN BOTH HER HANDS MEANWHILE THE REST RUSHED ON THE KING AND THE BODYGUARD SENT THEM FLYING
152-183930-0022 AND LIFTED THE PROSTRATE CAPTAIN WHO WAS ALL BUT PRESSED TO DEATH IT WAS SOME MOMENTS BEFORE HE RECOVERED BREATH AND CONSCIOUSNESS WHERE'S THE PRINCESS CRIED CURDIE AGAIN AND AGAIN NO ONE KNEW AND OFF THEY ALL RUSHED IN SEARCH OF HER
152-183930-0023 THROUGH EVERY ROOM IN THE HOUSE THEY WENT BUT NOWHERE WAS SHE TO BE FOUND NEITHER WAS ONE OF THE SERVANTS TO BE SEEN BUT CURDIE WHO HAD KEPT TO THE LOWER PART OF THE HOUSE WHICH WAS NOW QUIET ENOUGH BEGAN TO HEAR A CONFUSED SOUND AS OF A DISTANT HUBBUB
152-183930-0024 THE NOISE GREW AS HIS SHARP EARS GUIDED HIM TO A STAIR AND SO TO THE WINE CELLAR IT WAS FULL OF GOBLINS WHOM THE BUTLER WAS SUPPLYING WITH WINE AS FAST AS HE COULD DRAW IT WHILE THE QUEEN AND HER PARTY HAD ENCOUNTERED THE MEN AT ARMS
152-183930-0025 HARELIP WITH ANOTHER COMPANY HAD GONE OFF TO SEARCH THE HOUSE THEY CAPTURED EVERY ONE THEY MET AND WHEN THEY COULD FIND NO MORE THEY HURRIED AWAY TO CARRY THEM SAFE TO THE CAVERNS BELOW BUT WHEN THE BUTLER WHO WAS AMONGST THEM FOUND THAT THEIR PATH LAY THROUGH THE WINE CELLAR
152-183930-0026 HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF PERSUADING THEM TO TASTE THE WINE AND AS HE HAD HOPED THEY NO SOONER TASTED THAN THEY WANTED MORE THE ROUTED GOBLINS ON THEIR WAY BELOW JOINED THEM AND WHEN CURDIE ENTERED THEY WERE ALL WITH OUTSTRETCHED HANDS
152-183930-0027 IN WHICH WERE VESSELS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION FROM SAUCE PAN TO SILVER CUP PRESSING AROUND THE BUTLER WHO SAT AT THE TAP OF A HUGE CASK FILLING AND FILLING CURDIE CAST ONE GLANCE AROUND THE PLACE BEFORE COMMENCING HIS ATTACK
152-183930-0028 AND SAW IN THE FARTHEST CORNER A TERRIFIED GROUP OF THE DOMESTICS UNWATCHED BUT COWERING WITHOUT COURAGE TO ATTEMPT THEIR ESCAPE AMONGST THEM WAS THE TERROR STRICKEN FACE OF LOOTIE BUT NOWHERE COULD HE SEE THE PRINCESS
152-183930-0029 SEIZED WITH THE HORRIBLE CONVICTION THAT HARELIP HAD ALREADY CARRIED HER OFF HE RUSHED AMONGST THEM UNABLE FOR WRATH TO SING ANY MORE BUT STAMPING AND CUTTING WITH GREATER FURY THAN EVER
152-183930-0030 STAMP ON THEIR FEET STAMP ON THEIR FEET HE SHOUTED AND IN A MOMENT THE GOBLINS WERE DISAPPEARING THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE FLOOR LIKE RATS AND MICE THEY COULD NOT VANISH SO FAST HOWEVER
152-183930-0031 BUT THAT MANY MORE GOBLIN FEET HAD TO GO LIMPING BACK OVER THE UNDERGROUND WAYS OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT MORNING PRESENTLY HOWEVER THEY WERE REINFORCED FROM ABOVE BY THE KING AND HIS PARTY WITH THE REDOUBTABLE QUEEN AT THEIR HEAD
152-183930-0032 FINDING CURDIE AGAIN BUSY AMONGST HER UNFORTUNATE SUBJECTS SHE RUSHED AT HIM ONCE MORE WITH THE RAGE OF DESPAIR AND THIS TIME GAVE HIM A BAD BRUISE ON THE FOOT THEN A REGULAR STAMPING FIGHT GOT UP BETWEEN THEM
152-183930-0033 CURDIE WITH THE POINT OF HIS HUNTING KNIFE KEEPING HER FROM CLASPING HER MIGHTY ARMS ABOUT HIM AS HE WATCHED HIS OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING ONCE MORE A GOOD STAMP AT HER SKIN SHOD FOOT BUT THE QUEEN WAS MORE WARY AS WELL AS MORE AGILE THAN HITHERTO
152-183930-0034 THE REST MEANTIME FINDING THEIR ADVERSARY THUS MATCHED FOR THE MOMENT PAUSED IN THEIR HEADLONG HURRY AND TURNED TO THE SHIVERING GROUP OF WOMEN IN THE CORNER AS IF DETERMINED TO EMULATE HIS FATHER AND HAVE A SUN WOMAN OF SOME SORT TO SHARE HIS FUTURE THRONE
152-183930-0035 HARELIP RUSHED AT THEM CAUGHT UP LOOTIE AND SPED WITH HER TO THE HOLE SHE GAVE A GREAT SHRIEK AND CURDIE HEARD HER AND SAW THE PLIGHT SHE WAS IN GATHERING ALL HIS STRENGTH HE GAVE THE QUEEN A SUDDEN CUT ACROSS THE FACE WITH HIS WEAPON
152-183930-0036 CAME DOWN AS SHE STARTED BACK WITH ALL HIS WEIGHT ON THE PROPER FOOT AND SPRUNG TO LOOTIE'S RESCUE THE PRINCE HAD TWO DEFENCELESS FEET AND ON BOTH OF THEM CURDIE STAMPED JUST AS HE REACHED THE HOLE HE DROPPED HIS BURDEN AND ROLLED SHRIEKING INTO THE EARTH
152-183930-0037 CURDIE MADE ONE STAB AT HIM AS HE DISAPPEARED CAUGHT HOLD OF THE SENSELESS LOOTIE AND HAVING DRAGGED HER BACK TO THE CORNER THERE MOUNTED GUARD OVER HER PREPARING ONCE MORE TO ENCOUNTER THE QUEEN
152-183930-0038 HER FACE STREAMING WITH BLOOD AND HER EYES FLASHING GREEN LIGHTNING THROUGH IT SHE CAME ON WITH HER MOUTH OPEN AND HER TEETH GRINNING LIKE A TIGER'S FOLLOWED BY THE KING AND HER BODYGUARD OF THE THICKEST GOBLINS
152-183930-0039 BUT THE SAME MOMENT IN RUSHED THE CAPTAIN AND HIS MEN AND RAN AT THEM STAMPING FURIOUSLY THEY DARED NOT ENCOUNTER SUCH AN ONSET AWAY THEY SCURRIED THE QUEEN FOREMOST OF COURSE
152-183930-0040 THE RIGHT THING WOULD HAVE BEEN TO TAKE THE KING AND QUEEN PRISONERS AND HOLD THEM HOSTAGES FOR THE PRINCESS BUT THEY WERE SO ANXIOUS TO FIND HER THAT NO ONE THOUGHT OF DETAINING THEM UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE HAVING THUS RESCUED THE SERVANTS THEY SET ABOUT SEARCHING THE HOUSE ONCE MORE
152-183930-0041 NONE OF THEM COULD GIVE THE LEAST INFORMATION CONCERNING THE PRINCESS LOOTIE WAS ALMOST SILLY WITH TERROR AND ALTHOUGH SCARCELY ABLE TO WALK WOULD NOT LEAVE CURDIE'S SIDE FOR A SINGLE MOMENT AGAIN HE ALLOWED THE OTHERS TO SEARCH THE REST OF THE HOUSE
152-183930-0042 WHERE EXCEPT A DISMAYED GOBLIN LURKING HERE AND THERE THEY FOUND NO ONE WHILE HE REQUESTED LOOTIE TO TAKE HIM TO THE PRINCESS'S ROOM
152-183930-0043 HE FOUND THE BEDCLOTHES TOSSED ABOUT AND MOST OF THEM ON THE FLOOR WHILE THE PRINCESS'S GARMENTS WERE SCATTERED ALL OVER THE ROOM WHICH WAS IN THE GREATEST CONFUSION IT WAS ONLY TOO EVIDENT THAT THE GOBLINS HAD BEEN THERE
152-183930-0044 AND CURDIE HAD NO LONGER ANY DOUBT THAT SHE HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF AT THE VERY FIRST OF THE INROAD WITH A PANG OF DESPAIR HE SAW HOW WRONG THEY HAD BEEN IN NOT SECURING THE KING AND QUEEN AND PRINCE
