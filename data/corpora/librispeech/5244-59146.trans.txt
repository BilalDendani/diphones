5244-59146-0000 VALEDICTORY MUCH AS BRUCE WOULD HAVE WISHED TO INTER HIS DEAD FRIEND'S SECRET WITH HIS MORTAL REMAINS IN THE TOMB IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE SIR CHARLES DYKE'S SACRIFICE MUST NOT BE MADE IN VAIN
5244-59146-0001 AND THE STRANGE CHAIN OF EVENTS ENCIRCLED OTHER ACTORS IN THE DRAMA TOO STRONGLY TO ENABLE THE BARRISTER TO ADOPT THE COURSE WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE COMMENDED ITSELF TO HIM AN EARLY VISIT TO SCOTLAND YARD
5244-59146-0002 WHERE IN COMPANY WITH MISTER WHITE HE INTERVIEWED THE DEPUTY COMMISSIONER AND A CONFERENCE WITH THE DISTRICT CORONER SETTLED TWO IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THE POLICE WERE SATISFIED AS TO THE CAUSE OF LADY DYKE'S DEATH
5244-59146-0003 AND THE CORONER AGREED TO KEEP THE EVIDENCE AS TO THE BARONET'S SUDDEN COLLAPSE STRICTLY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE A WHOLLY UNNECESSARY PUBLIC SCANDAL WAS THUS AVOIDED
5244-59146-0004 WITH LADY DYKE'S RELATIVES HIS TASK REQUIRED CONSIDERABLE TACT WITHOUT TAKING THEM FULLY INTO HIS CONFIDENCE HE EXPLAINED THAT SIR CHARLES HAD ALL ALONG KNOWN THE EXACT FACTS BEARING UPON HER DEATH AND BURIAL PLACE
5244-59146-0005 BUT FOR FAMILY REASONS HE THOUGHT IT BEST NOT TO DISCLOSE HIS KNOWLEDGE BRUCE NEEDED THEIR CO OPERATION IN GETTING THE HOME OFFICE TO GIVE THE REQUISITE PERMISSION FOR LADY DYKE'S REBURIAL
5244-59146-0006 THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE DECEASED BARONET HAD LEFT HIS ESTATES TO HIS WIFE'S NEPHEW JOINED TO THE IMPORTANT POSITION BRUCE OCCUPIED AS ONE OF THE TRUSTEES AND JOINT GUARDIAN WITH THE BOY'S MOTHER OF THE YOUNG HEIR
5244-59146-0007 SMOOTHED OVER MANY DIFFICULTIES AFTER A HARASSING AND ANXIOUS WEEK BRUCE HAD THE MELANCHOLY SATISFACTION OF SEEING THE REMAINS OF THE UNFORTUNATE COUPLE LAID TO REST IN THE STATELY GLOOM OF THE FAMILY VAULT
5244-59146-0008 THE NEWSPAPERS OF COURSE SCENTED A MYSTERY IN THE PROCEEDINGS
5244-59146-0009 EVEN THE EXHUMATION ORDER GAVE NO CLUE TO THE REASONS OF THE AUTHORITIES FOR GRANTING IT AND IN LESS THAN THE PROVERBIAL NINE DAYS THE INCIDENT WAS FORGOTTEN SIR CHARLES HAD MADE IT A CONDITION PRECEDENT TO THE SUCCESSION
5244-59146-0010 AND SHOULD LIVE WITH HIS WIDOWED MOTHER ON THE YORKSHIRE ESTATE OR IN THE TOWN HOUSE FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MONTHS IN EACH YEAR
5244-59146-0011 SO HE ARRANGED THAT SHE SHOULD RECEIVE AN ANNUAL INCOME SUFFICIENT TO SECURE HER FROM WANT THOMPSON TOO WAS PROVIDED FOR WHEN THE TIME CAME THAT HE WAS TOO FEEBLE FOR FURTHER EMPLOYMENT AT PORTMAN SQUARE
5244-59146-0012 AND MISTER WHITE RECEIVED A HANDSOME DOUCEUR FOR HIS SERVICES MISSUS HILLMER DID NOT EVEN KNOW OF SIR CHARLES DYKE'S DEATH UNTIL WEEKS HAD PASSED ACTING ON BRUCE'S ADVICE
5244-59146-0013 HER BROTHER SIMPLY TOLD HER THAT EVERYTHING HAD BEEN SETTLED AND THAT THE AUTHORITIES CONCURRED WITH THE BARRISTER IN THE OPINION THAT LADY DYKE WAS ACCIDENTLY KILLED WHEN SHE HAD COMPLETELY RECOVERED FROM THE SHOCK OF THE BELIEF THAT HER LOYAL FRIEND HAD MURDERED HIS WIFE
5244-59146-0014 MENSMORE ONE DAY TOLD HER THE WHOLE SAD STORY BUT HE WOULD ALLOW NO MORE WEEPING IT IS TIME HE SAID THAT THE MISERY OF THIS EPISODE SHOULD CEASE WHEN THE CHIEF ACTOR IN THE TRAGEDY GAVE HIS LIFE TO END THE SUFFERING
5244-59146-0015 WE WOULD BUT ILL MEET HIS WISHES BY ALLOWING IT TO OCCUPY OUR THOUGHTS UNDULY IN THE FUTURE MENSMORE'S MARRIAGE WITH PHYLLIS BROWNE WAS NOW DEFINITELY FIXED FOR THE FOLLOWING AUTUMN SO HE CARRIED HIS SISTER OFF WITH HIM ON A HASTY TRIP TO WYOMING
5244-59146-0016 IN COMPANY WITH CORBETT A JOURNEY REQUIRED FOR THE PROTECTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR JOINT INTERESTS IN THAT STATE NOT ONLY DID THEIR PROPERTY TURN OUT TO BE OF GREAT AND LASTING VALUE BUT DURING THEIR ABSENCE THE SPRINGBOK MINE BEGAN TO BOOM
5244-59146-0017 EVEN THE CAUTIOUS BARRISTER ONE DAY FOUND HIMSELF HESITATING WHETHER OR NOT TO SELL AT HALF OVER PAR
5244-59146-0018 THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE WERE MARRIED A SCION OF THE HOUSE HAD BECOME A LUSTY TWO YEAR OLD MISTER WHITE HAD BECOME CHIEF INSPECTOR AND MISS MARIE LE MARCHANT HAD BY STRENUOUS EFFORT RISEN TO THE DIGNITY OF DOUBLE CROWN POSTERS
5244-59146-0019 AS A DASHING COMEDIENNE WHEN BRUCE'S MEMORIES OF HIS LOST FRIENDS WERE SUDDENLY REVIVED IN AN UNEXPECTED MANNER MISTER SYDNEY H CORBETT CAME TO HIM WITH MEASURED QUESTIONINGS AND BROODING THOUGHT STAMPED ON HIS BROWS
5244-59146-0020 IT'S LIKE THIS HE SAID WHEN THEY WERE SETTLED DOWN TO DETAILS I WANT TO GET MARRIED TO WHOM INQUIRED CLAUDE WONDERING AT THE SAVAGE TONE IN WHICH THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE TO MISSUS HILLMER OH
5244-59146-0021 SHE SCREAMS OH AND RUNS OFF WITH TEARS IN HER EYES HER BROTHER SAYS OH AND LOOKS UNCOMFORTABLE BUT REFUSES TO DISCUSS THE PROPOSITION NOW YOU SAY OH AND GAZE AT ME LIKE AN OWL AT THE BARE STATEMENT
5244-59146-0022 WHAT THE DICKENS DOES IT ALL MEAN I WANT TO KNOW I'M NOT WORRYING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED YEARS AGO MISSUS HILLMER IS JUST THE SORT OF WOMAN I REQUIRE AS A WIFE AND I'LL MARRY HER YET IF THE WHOLE BRITISH NATION SAYS OH LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD AND ANSWERED BY THE U NITED STATES
5244-59146-0023 THAT'S THE PROPER SORT OF SPIRIT IN WHICH TO SET ABOUT THE BUSINESS YES SIR BUT I CAN'T GET ANY FORRARDER THERE'S A KIND OF ROCK BELOW WATER WHICH HOLDS ME UP EVERY TIME I SHOOT THE RAPIDS SHE LIKES ME WELL ENOUGH I KNOW
5244-59146-0024 SHE CALLS ME SYD AS SLICK AS BUTTER AND I CALL HER GWEN BUT THERE YOU ARE IF I WANT TO GO AHEAD A BIT SHE PULLS UP AND WEEPS
5244-59146-0025 STEADY MISTER CORBETT WOMEN WEEP FOR MANY REASONS DO YOU KNOW HER HISTORY NO AND I DON'T WANT TO
5244-59146-0026 REMEMBER THAT SHE HAS BEEN MARRIED BEFORE WITH SOMEWHAT BITTER EXPERIENCE SHE PROBABLY BELIEVES THAT A HUSBAND AND WIFE SHOULD HAVE NO SECRETS FROM EACH OTHER ABOVE ALL ELSE THERE SHOULD BE NO CLOUD BETWEEN THEM AS TO BYGONE EVENTS
5244-59146-0027 MISSUS HILLMER IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE IF SHE IMAGINED YOU WERE UNDER ANY MISAPPREHENSION AS TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH SIR CHARLES AND LADY DYKE MET THEIR DEATHS
5244-59146-0028 SHE WOULD NEITHER ENTERTAIN YOUR PROPOSAL NOR EXPLAIN HER MOTIVES SHE WOULD JUST DO AS YOU SAY RUN AWAY AND CRY WELL NOW THAT BEATS EVERYTHING SAID CORBETT ADMIRINGLY THAT NEVER STRUCK ME BEFORE
5244-59146-0029 IT IS THE PROBABLE EXPLANATION OF HER ATTITUDE NEVERTHELESS THEN WHAT AM I TO DO WRITE TO HER ASK HER PERMISSION TO LEARN THE FACTS FROM ME TELL HER YOU BELIEVE YOU UNDERSTAND THE REASONS FOR HER RETICENCE
5244-59146-0030 AND THAT YOUR ONLY EXCUSE FOR THE REQUEST IS THAT YOU WANT TO GO TO HER ON AN EQUAL PLANE OF ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I'D BETTER GET QUICK AND DO IT SHOUTED CORBETT VANISHING WITH THE UTMOST CELERITY
5244-59146-0031 BRUCE STILL OCCUPIED HIS OLD CHAMBERS IN VICTORIA STREET HE DID NOT EXPECT TO SEE CORBETT AGAIN FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS TO THE BARRISTER'S UTTER AMAZEMENT HE RETURNED WITHIN TEN MINUTES FIRE AWAY HE CRIED EXCITEDLY
5244-59146-0032 YOU STRUCK IT FIRST TIME I JUST RANG HER UP RANG HER UP YES SHE'S STAYING AT THE SAVOY FOR A FEW DAYS
5244-59146-0033 I COULD NEVER FIX UP A LETTER IN YOUR WORDS YOU KNOW
5244-59146-0034 WHAT ON EARTH DID YOU SAY AS SOON AS I GOT HER IN THE BOX AT THE OTHER END I SAID IS THAT YOU GWEN YES SAID SHE WELL SAID I I GUESS YOU KNOW WHO'S TALKING QUITE WELL SAID SHE THEN SAID I
5244-59146-0035 I'VE JUST BEEN TELLING MISTER BRUCE I WANTED TO MARRY YOU AND THAT YOU WOULDN'T EVEN DISCUSS THE PROPOSITION HE SAID YOU PROBABLY WISHED ME TO KNOW THE WHOLE STORY OF SIR CHARLES DYKE BUT FELT KINDER SHY OF TELLING ME YOURSELF HE WILL GET IT OFF HIS CHEST IF YOU GIVE HIM PERMISSION
5244-59146-0036 AND THEN I CAN COME ALONG IN A HANSOM AND FIX THINGS WHAT DO YOU SAY THERE WAS NO ANSWER SO I SHOUTED ARE YOU THERE AND SHE SAID YES FAINT LIKE DON'T LET ME HURRY YOU SAID I BUT IF YOU AGREE STRAIGHT AWAY I CAN CATCH BRUCE AT HOME
5244-59146-0037 FOR I'VE JUST LEFT HIM WITH THAT SHE SAID VERY WELL YOU CAN SEE MISTER BRUCE AND HERE I AM HAVING ACCOMPLISHED THE WHOLE THING SATISFACTORILY AS HOW DON'T YOU SEE YOU HAVE PROPOSED TO THE LADY AND PRACTICALLY BEEN ACCEPTED
5244-59146-0038 SAY I'M OFF THIS STORY OF YOURS WILL KEEP UNTIL TO MORROW HE WOULD HAVE GONE BUT BRUCE JUMPED AFTER HIM NOT SO FAST MISTER CORBETT YOU MUST NOT SAIL INTO THE SAVOY FLYING A FALSE FLAG KINDLY OBLIGE ME WITH YOUR ATTENTION FOR THE NEXT HALF HOUR
5244-59146-0039 WITH THAT HE UNLOCKED A SAFE AND TOOK FROM ITS RECESSES SIR CHARLES DYKE'S CONFESSION HE READ THE WHOLE OF ITS OPENING PASSAGES EXPLAINING THE RELATIONS BETWEEN MISSUS HILLMER AND HER UNFORTUNATE BUT ABIDING FRIEND
5244-59146-0040 THE STRAIGHTFORWARD HONEST SENTENCES SOUNDED STRANGELY FAMILIAR AT THIS DISTANCE OF TIME BRUCE WAS GLAD OF THE OPPORTUNITY OF READING THEM ALOUD IT SEEMED A FITTING THING THAT THIS TESTIMONY SHOULD COME AS IT WERE FROM THE TOMB
5244-59146-0041 CORBETT LISTENED INTENTLY TO THE RECITAL AND TO THE BARRISTER'S SUMMARY OF THE EVENTS THAT FOLLOWED POOR CHAP HE SAID WHEN THE SAD TALE HAD ENDED I HOPE YOU SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM AS HE ASKED YOU TO DO I DID
5244-59146-0042 WOULD THAT MY GRASP HAD THE POWER TO REASSURE HIM OF MY HEARTFELT SYMPATHY FOR A LITTLE WHILE THEY WERE SILENT SO SAID CORBETT AT LAST GWEN THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS THE POOR LADY
5244-59146-0043 AND SUSPECT HER WRONGFULLY NO NOT THAT BUT NATURALLY SHE WISHED THE MAN WHOM SHE COULD TRUST AS A HUSBAND TO BE WHOLLY COGNIZANT OF EVENTS IN WHICH ALREADY HE HAD PARTICIPATED SLIGHTLY SHE WAS RIGHT
5244-59146-0044 I LIKE HER ALL THE BETTER FOR IT BUT TELL ME IS THERE ANY NECESSITY FOR THAT WONDERFUL DOCUMENT TO BE PRESERVED NOT THE SLIGHTEST IT HAS SERVED ITS LAST USE THEN PUT IT IN THE FIRE
5244-59146-0045 BRUCE DID NOT HESITATE A MOMENT TO COMPLY WITH THE WISH THE FLAMES DEVOURED THE RECORD WITH AVIDITY AND THE TWO MEN WATCHED THE MANUSCRIPT CRUMBLING INTO NOTHINGNESS
