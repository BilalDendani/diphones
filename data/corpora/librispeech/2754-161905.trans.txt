2754-161905-0000 INCESSANTLY EXTENDED TO THE VERY SMALLEST THINGS AFTER HAVING BEEN SEVERAL MONTHS WITHOUT ANY NEWS OF MY PAPERS WHEN SOME PRESSED ME TO WRITE AND BLAMED MY NEGLECT
2754-161905-0001 AN INVISIBLE HAND HELD ME BACK MY PEACE AND CONFIDENCE WERE GREAT I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE ECCLESIASTIC AT HOME WHICH INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO COME AND SEE ME
2754-161905-0002 I GAVE MYSELF NO TROUBLE I ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE FOUND THE MAN WHO HAD TAKEN CHARGE OF THEM MADE A SEARCH AFTER THEM A WHOLE MONTH
2754-161905-0003 IN ALL THE ENVIRONS WITHOUT HEARING ANY NEWS AT THE END OF THREE MONTHS THEY WERE BROUGHT TO ME HAVING BEEN FOUND IN THE HOUSE OF A POOR MAN WHO HAD NOT OPENED THEM
2754-161905-0004 NOR KNEW WHO BROUGHT THEM THERE ONCE I HAD SENT FOR ALL THE MONEY WHICH WAS TO SERVE ME A WHOLE YEAR THE PERSON WHO HAD BEEN TO RECEIVE CASH FOR THE BILL OF EXCHANGE
2754-161905-0005 HAVING PUT THAT MONEY IN TWO BAGS ON HORSEBACK FORGOT THAT IT WAS THERE AND GAVE THE HORSE TO A LITTLE BOY TO LEAD THE MONEY FELL FROM THE HORSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MARKET
2754-161905-0006 WAS IN THIS PLACE AND NOT ONE HAD PERCEIVED IT MANY SUCH THINGS HAVE ATTENDED ME
2754-161905-0007 THE CONTINUAL PROTECTION OF GOD THE BISHOP OF GENEVA CONTINUED TO PERSECUTE ME WHEN HE WROTE IT WAS WITH POLITENESS AND THANKS FOR MY CHARITIES AT GEX
2754-161905-0008 WHILE AT THE SAME TIME HE SAID TO OTHERS
2754-161905-0009 GAVE NOTHING TO THAT HOUSE HE WROTE AGAINST ME TO THE URSULINES WITH WHOM I LIVED CHARGING THEM TO HINDER ME FROM HAVING ANY CONFERENCES WITH FATHER LA COMBE
2754-161905-0010 AND THE PRIORESS AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITY WERE SO IRRITATED
2754-161905-0011 TESTIFYING IT TO HIM
2754-161905-0012 EXCUSED HIMSELF WITH A PRETENDED RESPECT SAYING HE DID NOT MEAN IT THAT WAY THEY WROTE TO HIM THAT I DID NOT SEE THE FATHER BUT AT THE CONFESSIONAL AND NOT IN CONFERENCE
2754-161905-0013 THAT THEY WERE SO MUCH EDIFIED BY ME AS TO THINK THEMSELVES HAPPY IN HAVING ME AND TO ESTEEM IT A GREATER FAVOR FROM GOD WHAT THEY SAID OUT OF PURE CHARITY
2754-161905-0014 I WERE OUT OF THE DIOCESE THOUGH I KNEW ALL THIS AND THESE GOOD SISTERS WERE TROUBLED AT IT I COULD HAVE NO TROUBLE BY REASON OF THE CALM ESTABLISHMENT WHICH I WAS IN
2754-161905-0015 AN HABITUAL FAITH CAUSES EVERYTHING TO BE SEEN IN GOD WITHOUT DISTINCTION THUS WHEN I SEE POOR SOULS SO RUFFLED FOR DISCOURSES IN THE AIR
2754-161905-0016 SO UNEASY FOR EXPLANATIONS I PITY THEM THEY HAVE REASONS I KNOW WHICH SELF LOVE CAUSES TO APPEAR VERY JUST TO RELIEVE MYSELF A LITTLE
2754-161905-0017 FROM THE FATIGUE OF CONTINUAL CONVERSATION I DESIRED FATHER LA COMBE TO ALLOW ME A RETREAT IT WAS THEN THAT I LET MYSELF BE CONSUMED BY LOVE ALL THE DAY LONG
2754-161905-0018 ALSO I PERCEIVED THE QUALITY OF A SPIRITUAL MOTHER FOR THE LORD GAVE ME WHAT I CANNOT EXPRESS FOR THE PERFECTION OF SOULS
2754-161905-0019 TOTAL DEATH AND THE ENTIRE DESTRUCTION OF THE OLD MAN HE WOULD HAVE ME CONTRIBUTE
2754-161905-0020 AND BE INSTRUMENTAL TO CAUSE HIM TO WALK IN THE WAY IN WHICH HE HAD LED ME FIRST IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT BE IN A CONDITION TO DIRECT OTHERS TO TELL THEM THE WAY
2754-161905-0021 THROUGH WHICH I HAVE PASSED THE LORD WOULD HAVE US TO BE CONFORMED AND TO BECOME BOTH ONE
2754-161905-0022 THOUGH MY SOUL WAS MORE ADVANCED NOW YET HE SHOULD ONE DAY PASS BEYOND IT WITH A BOLD AND RAPID FLIGHT GOD KNOWS WITH WHAT JOY
2754-161905-0023 I WOULD SEE MY SPIRITUAL CHILDREN SURPASS THEIR MOTHER IN THIS RETREAT I FELT A STRONG PROPENSITY TO WRITE
2754-161905-0024 I HAD NOTHING TO WRITE ABOUT NOT ONE IDEA TO BEGIN WITH IT WAS A DIVINE IMPULSE WITH SUCH A FULNESS OF GRACE AS WAS HARD TO CONTAIN
2754-161905-0025 ON ACCOUNT OF MY WEAKNESS I TOLD HIM THAT WEAKNESS WAS THE EFFECT OF MY RESISTANCE AND I BELIEVED IT WOULD THROUGH MY WRITING GO OFF AGAIN HE ASKED
2754-161905-0026 BUT WHAT IS IT YOU WILL WRITE I REPLIED I KNOW NOTHING OF IT NOR DESIRE TO KNOW LEAVING IT ENTIRELY TO GOD TO DIRECT ME
2754-161905-0027 HE ORDERED ME TO DO SO AT MY TAKING THE PEN I KNEW NOT THE FIRST WORD I SHOULD WRITE WHEN I BEGAN SUITABLE MATTER FLOWED COPIOUSLY
2754-161905-0028 AS I WAS WRITING I WAS RELIEVED AND GREW BETTER I WROTE AN ENTIRE TREATISE ON THE INTERIOR PATH OF FAITH UNDER THE COMPARISON OF TORRENTS OR OF STREAMS AND RIVERS
2754-161905-0029 AS THE WAY WHEREIN GOD NOW CONDUCTED FATHER LA COMBE WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN WHICH HE HAD FORMERLY WALKED ALL LIGHT KNOWLEDGE
2754-161905-0030 WHAT IT HAS COST MY HEART BEFORE HE WAS FORMED ACCORDING TO THE WILL OF GOD MEANWHILE THE POSSESSION WHICH THE LORD HAD OF MY SOUL BECAME EVERY DAY STRONGER
2754-161905-0031 THAT I PASSED WHOLE DAYS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO PRONOUNCE ONE WORD THE LORD WAS PLEASED TO MAKE ME PASS WHOLLY INTO HIM BY AN ENTIRE INTERNAL TRANSFORMATION
2754-161905-0032 HE BECAME MORE AND MORE THE ABSOLUTE MASTER OF MY HEART TO SUCH A DEGREE AS NOT TO LEAVE ME A MOVEMENT OF MY OWN THIS STATE DID NOT HINDER ME
2754-161905-0033 FROM CONDESCENDING TO MY SISTER AND THE OTHERS IN THE HOUSE NEVERTHELESS THE USELESS THINGS WITH WHICH THEY WERE TAKEN UP COULD NOT INTEREST ME THAT
2754-161905-0034 WAS WHAT INDUCED ME TO ASK LEAVE TO MAKE A RETREAT
