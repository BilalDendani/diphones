2152-133067-0000 BUT THAT HE TRUSTED SOON TO SEE HIM BETTER AND WOULD CALL AGAIN THE NEXT DAY UNLESS SHE SENT FOR HIM EARLIER HE WENT DIRECTLY HOME
2152-133067-0001 HE FELT HIMSELF BECOMING VIOLENT AND UNREASONABLE AS IF RAGING UNDER THE PAIN OF STINGS HE WAS READY TO CURSE THE DAY ON WHICH HE HAD COME TO MIDDLEMARCH
2152-133067-0002 FOR THIS HATEFUL FATALITY WHICH HAD COME AS A BLIGHT ON HIS HONORABLE AMBITION AND MUST MAKE EVEN PEOPLE WHO HAD ONLY VULGAR STANDARDS REGARD HIS REPUTATION AS IRREVOCABLY DAMAGED IN SUCH MOMENTS
2152-133067-0003 A MAN CAN HARDLY ESCAPE BEING UNLOVING LYDGATE THOUGHT OF HIMSELF AS THE SUFFERER AND OF OTHERS AS THE AGENTS WHO HAD INJURED HIS LOT HE HAD MEANT EVERYTHING TO TURN OUT DIFFERENTLY
2152-133067-0004 AND OTHERS HAD THRUST THEMSELVES INTO HIS LIFE AND THWARTED HIS PURPOSES
2152-133067-0005 UNMITIGATED CALAMITY AND HE WAS AFRAID OF GOING TO ROSAMOND BEFORE HE HAD VENTED HIMSELF IN THIS SOLITARY RAGE LEST THE MERE SIGHT OF HER SHOULD EXASPERATE HIM AND MAKE HIM BEHAVE UNWARRANTABLY
2152-133067-0006 THERE ARE EPISODES IN MOST MEN'S LIVES IN WHICH THEIR HIGHEST QUALITIES CAN ONLY CAST A DETERRING SHADOW OVER THE OBJECTS THAT FILL THEIR INWARD VISION
2152-133067-0007 LYDGATE'S TENDERHEARTEDNESS WAS PRESENT JUST THEN ONLY AS A DREAD LEST HE SHOULD OFFEND AGAINST IT NOT AS AN EMOTION THAT SWAYED HIM TO TENDERNESS FOR HE WAS VERY MISERABLE
2152-133067-0008 ONLY THOSE WHO KNOW THE SUPREMACY OF THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE THE LIFE WHICH HAS A SEED OF ENNOBLING THOUGHT AND PURPOSE WITHIN IT CAN UNDERSTAND THE GRIEF OF ONE WHO FALLS FROM THAT SERENE ACTIVITY INTO THE ABSORBING SOUL WASTING STRUGGLE
2152-133067-0009 WITH WORLDLY ANNOYANCES HOW WAS HE TO LIVE ON WITHOUT VINDICATING HIMSELF AMONG PEOPLE WHO SUSPECTED HIM OF BASENESS
2152-133067-0010 CONDEMNATION AND YET HOW WAS HE TO SET ABOUT VINDICATING HIMSELF FOR THAT SCENE AT THE MEETING WHICH HE HAD JUST WITNESSED ALTHOUGH IT HAD TOLD HIM NO PARTICULARS HAD BEEN ENOUGH TO MAKE HIS OWN SITUATION
2152-133067-0011 THOROUGHLY CLEAR TO HIM BULSTRODE HAD BEEN IN DREAD OF SCANDALOUS DISCLOSURES ON THE PART OF RAFFLES LYDGATE COULD NOW CONSTRUCT ALL THE PROBABILITIES OF THE CASE HE WAS AFRAID OF SOME BETRAYAL IN MY HEARING
2152-133067-0012 THAT WAS WHY HE PASSED ON A SUDDEN FROM HARDNESS TO LIBERALITY AND HE MAY HAVE TAMPERED WITH THE PATIENT HE MAY HAVE DISOBEYED MY ORDERS I FEAR HE DID
2152-133067-0013 BUT WHETHER HE DID OR NOT THE WORLD BELIEVES THAT HE SOMEHOW OR OTHER POISONED THE MAN AND THAT I WINKED AT THE CRIME IF I DIDN'T HELP IN IT AND YET AND YET HE MAY NOT BE GUILTY OF THE LAST OFFENCE AND IT IS
2152-133067-0014 JUST POSSIBLE THAT THE CHANGE TOWARDS ME MAY HAVE BEEN A GENUINE RELENTING THE EFFECT OF SECOND THOUGHTS SUCH AS HE ALLEGED
2152-133067-0015 WHAT WE CALL THE JUST POSSIBLE IS SOMETIMES TRUE AND THE THING WE FIND IT EASIER TO BELIEVE IS GROSSLY FALSE IN HIS LAST DEALINGS WITH THIS MAN BULSTRODE MAY HAVE KEPT HIS HANDS PURE IN SPITE OF MY SUSPICION TO THE CONTRARY
2152-133067-0016 IF HE MET SHRUGS COLD GLANCES AND AVOIDANCE AS AN ACCUSATION AND MADE A PUBLIC STATEMENT OF ALL THE FACTS AS HE KNEW THEM WHO WOULD BE CONVINCED IT WOULD BE PLAYING THE PART OF A FOOL TO
2152-133067-0017 OFFER HIS OWN TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF HIMSELF AND SAY I DID NOT TAKE THE MONEY AS A BRIBE
2152-133067-0018 ASSERTION AND BESIDES TO COME FORWARD AND TELL EVERYTHING ABOUT HIMSELF
2152-133067-0019 IN TO THIS MAN AND AFTER ALL THE SUSPICION OF BULSTRODE'S MOTIVES MIGHT BE UNJUST BUT THEN CAME THE QUESTION WHETHER HE SHOULD HAVE ACTED IN PRECISELY THE SAME WAY IF HE HAD NOT TAKEN THE MONEY
2152-133067-0020 CERTAINLY IF RAFFLES HAD CONTINUED ALIVE AND SUSCEPTIBLE OF FURTHER TREATMENT WHEN HE ARRIVED AND HE HAD THEN IMAGINED ANY DISOBEDIENCE TO HIS ORDERS ON THE PART OF BULSTRODE HE WOULD HAVE MADE A STRICT INQUIRY AND IF HIS
2152-133067-0021 HE WOULD HAVE THROWN UP THE CASE IN SPITE OF HIS RECENT HEAVY OBLIGATION BUT IF HE HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY MONEY IF BULSTRODE HAD NEVER REVOKED HIS COLD RECOMMENDATION OF BANKRUPTCY
2152-133067-0022 WOULD HE LYDGATE HAVE ABSTAINED FROM ALL INQUIRY EVEN ON FINDING THE MAN DEAD WOULD THE SHRINKING FROM AN INSULT TO BULSTRODE
2152-133067-0023 WOULD THE DUBIOUSNESS OF ALL MEDICAL TREATMENT AND THE ARGUMENT THAT HIS OWN TREATMENT WOULD PASS FOR THE WRONG WITH MOST MEMBERS OF HIS PROFESSION HAVE HAD JUST THE SAME FORCE OR SIGNIFICANCE WITH HIM
2152-133067-0024 AND RESISTING ALL REPROACH IF HE HAD BEEN INDEPENDENT THIS MATTER OF A PATIENT'S TREATMENT AND THE DISTINCT RULE THAT HE MUST DO OR SEE DONE THAT WHICH HE BELIEVED BEST FOR THE LIFE COMMITTED TO HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN
2152-133067-0025 THE POINT ON WHICH HE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE STURDIEST AS IT WAS HE HAD RESTED IN THE CONSIDERATION THAT DISOBEDIENCE TO HIS ORDERS HOWEVER IT MIGHT HAVE ARISEN COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A CRIME
2152-133067-0026 THAT IN THE DOMINANT OPINION OBEDIENCE TO HIS ORDERS WAS JUST AS LIKELY TO BE FATAL AND THAT THE AFFAIR WAS SIMPLY ONE OF ETIQUETTE WHEREAS AGAIN AND AGAIN IN HIS TIME OF FREEDOM HE HAD DENOUNCED THE PERVERSION OF PATHOLOGICAL DOUBT
2152-133067-0027 INTO MORAL DOUBT AND HAD SAID THE PUREST EXPERIMENT IN TREATMENT MAY STILL BE CONSCIENTIOUS MY BUSINESS IS TO TAKE CARE OF LIFE AND TO DO THE BEST I CAN THINK OF FOR IT SCIENCE IS PROPERLY MORE SCRUPULOUS THAN DOGMA
2152-133067-0028 AND MUST KEEP THE CONSCIENCE ALIVE ALAS THE SCIENTIFIC CONSCIENCE HAD GOT INTO THE DEBASING COMPANY OF MONEY OBLIGATION AND SELFISH RESPECTS
2152-133067-0029 IS THERE A MEDICAL MAN OF THEM ALL IN MIDDLEMARCH WHO WOULD QUESTION HIMSELF AS I DO SAID POOR LYDGATE WITH A RENEWED OUTBURST OF REBELLION AGAINST THE OPPRESSION OF HIS LOT AND YET
2152-133067-0030 THEY WILL ALL FEEL WARRANTED IN MAKING A WIDE SPACE BETWEEN ME AND THEM AS IF I WERE A LEPER MY PRACTICE AND MY REPUTATION ARE UTTERLY DAMNED I CAN SEE THAT EVEN IF I COULD BE CLEARED BY VALID EVIDENCE
2152-133067-0031 IT WOULD MAKE LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO THE BLESSED WORLD HERE I HAVE BEEN SET DOWN AS TAINTED AND SHOULD BE CHEAPENED TO THEM ALL THE SAME ALREADY THERE HAD BEEN ABUNDANT SIGNS WHICH HAD HITHERTO PUZZLED HIM THAT JUST WHEN HE HAD BEEN PAYING OFF HIS DEBTS
2152-133067-0032 THE TOWNSMEN WERE AVOIDING HIM OR LOOKING STRANGELY AT HIM AND IN TWO INSTANCES IT CAME TO HIS KNOWLEDGE THAT PATIENTS OF HIS HAD CALLED IN ANOTHER PRACTITIONER
2152-133067-0033 THE GENERAL BLACK BALLING HAD BEGUN NO WONDER THAT IN LYDGATE'S ENERGETIC NATURE THE SENSE OF A HOPELESS MISCONSTRUCTION EASILY TURNED INTO A DOGGED RESISTANCE
2152-133067-0034 THE SCOWL WHICH OCCASIONALLY SHOWED ITSELF ON HIS SQUARE BROW WAS NOT A MEANINGLESS ACCIDENT ALREADY WHEN HE WAS RE ENTERING THE TOWN AFTER THAT RIDE TAKEN IN THE FIRST HOURS OF STINGING PAIN
2152-133067-0035 HE WAS SETTING HIS MIND ON REMAINING IN MIDDLEMARCH IN SPITE OF THE WORST THAT COULD BE DONE AGAINST HIM HE WOULD NOT RETREAT BEFORE CALUMNY AS IF HE SUBMITTED TO IT HE WOULD FACE IT TO THE UTMOST AND NO ACT OF HIS
2152-133067-0036 IT BELONGED TO THE GENEROSITY AS WELL AS DEFIANT FORCE OF HIS NATURE THAT HE RESOLVED NOT TO SHRINK FROM SHOWING TO THE FULL HIS SENSE OF OBLIGATION TO BULSTRODE IT WAS TRUE
2152-133067-0037 THAT THE ASSOCIATION WITH THIS MAN HAD BEEN FATAL TO HIM TRUE THAT IF HE HAD HAD THE THOUSAND POUNDS STILL IN HIS HANDS WITH ALL HIS DEBTS UNPAID HE WOULD HAVE RETURNED THE MONEY TO BULSTRODE
2152-133067-0038 SULLIED WITH THE SUSPICION OF A BRIBE
2152-133067-0039 NEVERTHELESS HE WOULD NOT TURN AWAY FROM THIS CRUSHED FELLOW MORTAL WHOSE AID HE HAD USED AND MAKE A PITIFUL EFFORT TO GET ACQUITTAL FOR HIMSELF BY HOWLING AGAINST ANOTHER I SHALL DO AS I THINK RIGHT AND EXPLAIN TO NOBODY
2152-133067-0040 HE WAS GOING ON WITH AN OBSTINATE RESOLVE BUT HE WAS GETTING NEAR HOME AND THE THOUGHT OF ROSAMOND URGED ITSELF AGAIN INTO THAT CHIEF PLACE FROM WHICH IT HAD BEEN THRUST BY THE AGONIZED STRUGGLES OF WOUNDED HONOR AND PRIDE
