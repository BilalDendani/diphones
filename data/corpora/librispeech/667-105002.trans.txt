667-105002-0000 AND IT WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE FORCEFUL MEN AS WELL AS THE EXTREME NATURE OF THE CONFLICT THAT BOTH WERE QUIET IN MANNER AND SPEECH PERHAPS THE MAYOR THE MORE SO AS HE BEGAN THE STRUGGLE BY SAYING
667-105002-0001 IS WHAT MISSUS PACKARD SAYS OF YOUR PLAYING WITH HER FEARS DURING THESE TWO WEEKS TRUE MISTER STEELE WITHOUT A DROOP OF HIS EYE OR A TREMOR IN HIS VOICE THE ANSWER CAME SHORT SHARP AND EMPHATIC YES
667-105002-0002 THEN YOU ARE A VILLAIN AND I SHALL NOT FEEL MYSELF CALLED UPON TO SHOW YOU ANY CONSIDERATION BEYOND WHAT JUSTICE DEMANDS HAVE YOU ANY PLEA TO URGE BEYOND THE NATURAL ONE OF HER SEEMINGLY UNPROVOKED DESERTION OF YOU HAS NOT MY WIFE
667-105002-0003 THE NOBILITY WITH WHICH HE EMPHASIZED THOSE TWO WORDS MADE MY HEART SWELL SPOKEN THE TRUTH AH THEN THE MASK OF DISDAINFUL SERENITY WITH WHICH THE OTHER HAD HITHERTO VEILED THE BURNING ANGUISH OF HIS SOUL FELL IN ONE BURST
667-105002-0004 OF IRRESISTIBLE PASSION TRUE YES IT IS TRUE BUT WHAT DOES THAT TRUTH INVOLVE FOR ME NOT TWO WEEKS
667-105002-0005 FIVE OF THEM DEVOTED TO GRIEF FOR HER LOSS AND TWO TO RAGE AND BITTER REVULSION AGAINST HER WHOLE SEX WHEN I FOUND HER ALIVE AND MYSELF THE DESPISED VICTIM OF HER DECEPTION SHE WRONGED YOU SHE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
667-105002-0006 JUST TO FEED YOUR REVENGE YES I WOULD DO THAT JEOPARDIZE INTERESTS YOU HAVE SO OFTEN PROFESSED IN MY HEARING TO BE FAR ABOVE PERSONAL CONSIDERATION THE SUCCESS OF YOUR PARTY THE TRIUMPH OF YOUR POLITICAL PRINCIPLES
667-105002-0007 MY POLITICAL PRINCIPLES OH THE IRONY OF HIS VOICE THE TRIUMPH IN HIS LAUGH AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF THEM
667-105002-0008 YOUR EDUCATION AS A POLITICIAN HAS YET TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE YOU WILL BE FIT FOR THE GOVERNORSHIP OF A STATE I AM AN ADEPT AT THE GLORIFICATION OF THE PARTY OF THE MAN THAT IT SUITS MY PRESENT EXIGENCIES TO PROMOTE
667-105002-0009 BUT IT IS A FACULTY WHICH SHOULD HAVE MADE YOU PAUSE BEFORE YOU TRUSTED ME WITH THE FURTHERANCE AND FINAL SUCCESS OF A CAMPAIGN WHICH MAY OUTLAST THOSE EXIGENCIES I HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN OF YOUR PARTY I AM NOT SO NOW AT HEART
667-105002-0010 THE MAYOR OUTRAGED IN EVERY SENTIMENT OF HONOR AS WELL AS IN THE MOST CHERISHED FEELINGS OF HIS HEART LOWERED UPON HIS UNMOVED SECRETARY WITH A WRATH WHICH WOULD HAVE BORNE DOWN ANY OTHER MAN BEFORE IT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU
667-105002-0011 THAT YOUR WORK IS A TRAITOR'S WORK THAT THE GLORIFICATION YOU SPEAK OF IS FALSE THAT YOU MAY TALK IN MY FAVOR
667-105002-0012 I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN MAKING MYSELF INTELLIGIBLE THE MAYOR FLUSHED INDIGNATION GAVE HIM VEHEMENCE THEN HE CRIED
667-105002-0013 THE WOMAN WHO HAS QUEENED IT SO LONG IN C SOCIETY CAN NOT WISH TO UNDERGO THE CHARGE OF BIGAMY YOU WILL BRING SUCH A CHARGE CERTAINLY IF SHE DOES NOT VOLUNTARILY QUIT HER FALSE POSITION
667-105002-0014 AND ACCEPTING THE PROTECTION OF THE MAN WHOSE NAME IS REALLY HERS GO FROM THIS HOUSE AT ONCE AT THIS ALTERNATIVE UTTERED WITH ICY DELIBERATION MISSUS PACKARD RECOILED WITH A SHARP CRY
667-105002-0015 WHICH NAME STEELE OR BRAINARD YOU ACKNOWLEDGED BOTH MY REAL NAME IS BRAINARD THEREFORE IT IS ALSO HERS BUT I SHALL BE CONTENT IF SHE WILL TAKE MY PRESENT ONE OF STEELE
667-105002-0016 TILL THIS MATTER CAN BE LEGALLY SETTLED I DO NOT WISH TO MAKE MYSELF HATEFUL TO HER FOR I ANTICIPATE THE DAY WHEN SHE WILL BE MY WIFE IN HEART AS SHE IS NOW IN LAW NEVER THE WORD RANG OUT IN TRUE WOMANLY REVOLT
667-105002-0017 I WILL DIE BEFORE THAT DAY EVER COMES TO SEPARATE ME FROM THE MAN I LOVE AND THE CHILD WHO CALLS ME MOTHER YOU MAY FORCE ME FROM THIS HOUSE YOU MAY PLUNGE ME INTO POVERTY INTO CONTUMELY
667-105002-0018 WOULD NOT LONG RUN IN OBSCURE CHANNELS IT WAS A SARCASM CALCULATED TO MADDEN THE PROUD MAN WHO ONLY A FEW MINUTES BEFORE HAD DESIGNATED THE OBJECT OF IT BY THE SACRED NAME OF WIFE BUT BEYOND A HASTY GLANCE AT THE WOMAN IT HAD BOWED ALMOST TO THE GROUND
667-105002-0019 THE MAYOR GAVE NO EVIDENCE OF FEELING EITHER ITS FORCE OR ASSUMPTION
667-105002-0020 HOW OLD WERE YOU THEN HE DEMANDED WITH ALARMING INCONGRUITY THE SECRETARY STARTED HE ANSWERED HOWEVER CALMLY ENOUGH I SEVEN YEARS AGO I WAS TWENTY FIVE I AM THIRTY TWO NOW SO I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY
667-105002-0021 A MAN OF TWENTY FIVE IS OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE MADE A RECORD MISTER STEELE THE MAYOR'S TONE HARDENED SO DID HIS MANNER
667-105002-0022 MISTER STEELE I DO NOT MEAN YOU TO DISTURB MY HOUSE OR TO ROB ME OF MY WIFE WHAT WAS YOUR LIFE BEFORE YOU MET OLYMPIA BREWSTER A PAUSE THE SLIGHTEST IN THE WORLD BUT THE KEEN EYE OF THE ASTUTE LAWYER NOTED IT
667-105002-0023 AND HIS TONE GREW IN SEVERITY AND ASSURANCE YOU HAVE KNOWN FOR TWO YEARS THAT THIS WOMAN WHOM YOU CALLED YOURS WAS WITHIN YOUR REACH IF NOT UNDER YOUR VERY EYE AND YOU FORBORE TO CLAIM HER
667-105002-0024 HAS THIS DELAY HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE RECORD OF THOSE YEARS TO WHICH I HAVE JUST ALLUDED HAD THE RANDOM SHOT TOLD THE SECRETARY'S EYE DID NOT FALTER
667-105002-0025 YET THE IMPRESSION MADE BY HIS LOOK AND ATTITUDE WERE NOT THE SAME THE FIRE HAD GONE OUT OF THEM A BLIGHT HAD STRUCK HIS SOUL THE FLUSH OF HIS TRIUMPH WAS GONE MAYOR PACKARD WAS MERCILESS
667-105002-0026 ONLY TWO CONSIDERATIONS COULD HOLD BACK A MAN LIKE YOU FROM URGING A CLAIM HE REGARDED AS A SACRED RIGHT THE FACT OF A FORMER MARRIAGE OR THE REMEMBRANCE OF A FORFEITED CITIZENSHIP
667-105002-0027 WHICH WOULD DELEGALIZE WHATEVER CONTRACT YOU MAY HAVE ENTERED INTO STILL THE SECRETARY'S EYE DID NOT SWERVE
667-105002-0028 AS IF AFRAID OF BETRAYING A TREMOR IN HIS RIGIDLY DRAWN UP FIGURE WAS THERE THE IMPEDIMENT OF A FORMER MARRIAGE NO ANSWER FROM THE STERNLY SET LIPS OR WAS IT THAT YOU ONCE SERVED A TERM A VERY SHORT TERM CUT SHORT BY A SUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE
667-105002-0029 OVER WHICH OF THEM SHOULD I WASTE MY TIME THEN THE TIGER BROKE LOOSE IN THE MAN WHO FROM THE AGGRESSOR HAD BECOME THE ATTACKED AND HE CRIED I SHALL NEVER ANSWER THE DEVIL HAS WHISPERED HIS OWN SUGGESTIONS IN YOUR EAR THE DEVIL AND NOTHING ELSE
667-105002-0030 NO NOT THE DEVIL BUT YOURSELF YOU EVEN THE YOU OF SEVEN YEARS BACK WOULD NOT HAVE LIVED IN ANY COUNTRY TOWN IF NECESSITY OR LET US SAY SAFETY HAD NOT DEMANDED IT YOU WITH YOUR LOOKS AND YOUR AMBITIONS
667-105002-0031 TO MARRY AT TWENTY FIVE A GIRL FROM THE KITCHEN ANY GIRL EVEN IF SHE HAD THE MAKING OF AN OLYMPIA PACKARD
667-105002-0032 OR BETTER PROSPECTS OFFERED THE CIPHER AND THE DESIRABILITY YOU EXPRESSED OF A MEANS OF COMMUNICATION UNREADABLE SAVE BY YOU TWO ALL THIS WAS ENOUGH TO START THE SUSPICION YOUR OWN MANNER HAS DONE THE REST
667-105002-0033 MISTER STEELE YOU ARE BOTH A VILLAIN AND A BASTARD AND HAVE NO RIGHT IN LAW TO THIS WOMAN CONTRADICT ME IF YOU DARE I DARE BUT WILL NOT WAS THE VIOLENT REPLY I SHALL NOT GIVE YOU EVEN THAT SATISFACTION
667-105002-0034 THIS WOMAN WHO HAS GONE THROUGH THE CEREMONY OF MARRIAGE WITH BOTH OF US SHALL NEVER KNOW TO WHICH OF US SHE IS THE LEGAL WIFE PERHAPS IT IS AS GOOD A REVENGE AS THE OTHER IT CERTAINLY WILL INTERFERE AS MUCH WITH HER PEACE OH OH NOT THAT I CAN NOT BEAR THAT
667-105002-0035 I LOOKED TO SEE THE MAYOR SPRING AND GRASP HIM BY THE THROAT BUT THAT WAS LEFT FOR ANOTHER HAND AS THE SECRETARY BENT TO TOUCH THE DOOR IT SUDDENLY FLEW VIOLENTLY OPEN AND NIXON QUIVERING IN EVERY LIMB AND WITH HIS FACE AFIRE
667-105002-0036 SPRANG IN AND SEIZED UPON THE OTHER WITH A VIOLENCE OF PASSION
667-105002-0037 YIELDED MORE AND MORE TO A SUDDEN WEAKNESS SAPPING HIS LIFE VIGOR TILL HE FELL PRONE AND APPARENTLY LIFELESS ON THE LOUNGE TOWARD WHICH
667-105002-0038 GOOD GOOD RANG THRILLING THROUGH THE ROOM
667-105002-0039 GOD HAS FINISHED WHAT THESE OLD ARMS HAD ONLY STRENGTH ENOUGH TO BEGIN HE IS DEAD THIS TIME AND IT'S A MERCY THANK GOD MISS OLYMPIA THANK GOD AS I DO NOW ON MY KNEES BUT HERE CATCHING THE MAYOR'S EYE
667-105002-0040 HE FALTERED TO HIS FEET AGAIN SAYING HUMBLY AS HE CREPT AWAY I COULDN'T HELP IT YOUR HONOR
667-105002-0041 BUT I HAVE LOVED MISS OLYMPIA AS WE USED TO CALL HER
667-105002-0042 AND ALL I'M SORRY FOR
