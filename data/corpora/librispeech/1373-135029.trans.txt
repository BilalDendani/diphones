1373-135029-0000 AS TIK TOK HAS TO DO EVERYTHING IN HIS SLOW MECHANICAL WAY DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY ARE LIKELY TO FAIL ASKED THE ROSE PRINCESS I DO INDEED REPLIED SHAGGY
1373-135029-0001 THIS NOME KING IS REALLY A POWERFUL FELLOW AND HAS A LEGION OF NOMES TO ASSIST HIM WHEREAS OUR BOLD QUEEN COMMANDS A CLOCKWORK MAN AND A BAND OF FAINT HEARTED OFFICERS
1373-135029-0002 SHE OUGHT TO HAVE LET QUOX DO THE CONQUERING SAID POLYCHROME DANCING LIGHTLY UPON A POINT OF ROCK AND FLUTTERING HER BEAUTIFUL DRAPERIES BUT PERHAPS THE DRAGON WAS WISE TO LET HER GO FIRST FOR WHEN SHE FAILS TO CONQUER RUGGEDO
1373-135029-0003 SHE MAY BECOME MORE MODEST IN HER AMBITIONS WHERE IS THE DRAGON NOW INQUIRED OZGA UP THERE ON THE ROCKS REPLIED FILES
1373-135029-0004 AND HE ADDED THAT AFTER WE HAD GOTTEN INTO TROUBLE HE WOULD WAKE UP AND CONQUER THE NOME KING IN A JIFFY AS HIS MASTER THE JINJIN HAS ORDERED HIM TO DO QUOX MEANS WELL SAID SHAGGY BUT I DO NOT THINK WE SHALL NEED HIS SERVICES
1373-135029-0005 FOR JUST AS SOON AS I AM SATISFIED THAT QUEEN ANN AND HER ARMY HAVE FAILED TO CONQUER RUGGEDO I SHALL ENTER THE CAVERNS AND SHOW THE KING MY LOVE MAGNET THAT HE CANNOT RESIST THEREFORE THE CONQUEST WILL BE MADE WITH EASE
1373-135029-0006 THIS SPEECH OF SHAGGY MAN'S WAS OVERHEARD BY THE LONG EARED HEARER
1373-135029-0007 HAD RECOVERED FROM HANK'S KICK AND HAD PICKED THEMSELVES UP THEIR FIRST ACT WAS TO TURN TIK TOK ON HIS BACK AND PUT A HEAVY DIAMOND ON TOP OF HIM SO THAT HE COULD NOT GET UP AGAIN THEN THEY CAREFULLY PUT HIS GUN IN A CORNER OF THE CAVERN
1373-135029-0008 BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE NOME KING TO BE HIS MASTER AND WAS READY TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS THEREFORE HE REPEATED SHAGGY'S SPEECH TO THE KING WHO AT ONCE REALIZED THAT HIS KINGDOM WAS IN GRAVE DANGER
1373-135029-0009 AND TURN ALL THE HATRED IN HIS HEART INTO LOVE RUGGEDO WAS PROUD OF HIS HATRED AND ABHORRED LOVE OF ANY SORT REALLY SAID HE
1373-135029-0010 KALIKO RETURNED TO THE CAVERN IN TIME TO OVERHEAR THIS QUESTION AND BEING A LOYAL NOME AND EAGER TO SERVE HIS KING HE ANSWERED BY SAYING IF WE CAN MANAGE TO BIND THE SHAGGY MAN'S ARMS TIGHT TO HIS BODY
1373-135029-0011 HE COULD NOT GET THE LOVE MAGNET OUT OF HIS POCKET TRUE CRIED THE KING IN DELIGHT AT THIS EASY SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM GET AT ONCE A DOZEN NOMES WITH ROPES AND PLACE THEM IN THE PASSAGE WHERE THEY CAN SEIZE AND BIND SHAGGY AS SOON AS HE ENTERS
1373-135029-0012 THIS KALIKO DID AND MEANWHILE THE WATCHERS OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE WERE GROWING MORE AND MORE UNEASY ABOUT THEIR FRIENDS I DON'T WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT THE OOGABOO PEOPLE SAID POLYCHROME WHO HAD GROWN SOBER WITH WAITING
1373-135029-0013 AND PERHAPS A LITTLE NERVOUS FOR THEY COULD NOT BE KILLED EVEN THOUGH RUGGEDO MIGHT CAUSE THEM MUCH SUFFERING AND PERHAPS DESTROY THEM UTTERLY BUT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED BETSY AND HANK TO GO ALONE INTO THE CAVERNS THE LITTLE GIRL IS MORTAL
1373-135029-0014 AND POSSESSES NO MAGIC POWERS WHATEVER
1373-135029-0015 THAT IS INDEED TRUE REPLIED SHAGGY
1373-135029-0016 SO I BELIEVE I'LL GO IN RIGHT AWAY AND PUT AN END TO ALL THIS WORRY
1373-135029-0017 YOU CAN SOON BRING THE NOME KING TO REASON SO IT WAS DECIDED TO WAIT NO LONGER SHAGGY WALKED THROUGH THE ENTRANCE FIRST AND AFTER HIM CAME THE OTHERS THEY HAD NO THOUGHT OF DANGER TO THEMSELVES
1373-135029-0018 WAS MUCH SURPRISED WHEN A ROPE SHOT OUT FROM THE DARKNESS AND TWINED AROUND HIS BODY
1373-135029-0019 BUT FILES AND THE PRINCESS FOLLOWED ON AFTER SHAGGY DETERMINED NOT TO DESERT THEIR FRIEND AND HOPING THAT AN OPPORTUNITY MIGHT ARISE TO RESCUE HIM AS FOR POLYCHROME
1373-135029-0020 AS SOON AS SHE SAW THAT TROUBLE HAD OVERTAKEN SHAGGY SHE TURNED AND RAN LIGHTLY BACK THROUGH THE PASSAGE AND OUT OF THE ENTRANCE
1373-135029-0021 WAKE UP QUOX SHE CRIED IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO ACT BUT QUOX DID NOT WAKE UP HE LAY AS ONE IN A TRANCE ABSOLUTELY MOTIONLESS WITH HIS ENORMOUS EYES TIGHT CLOSED
1373-135029-0022 THE EYELIDS HAD BIG SILVER SCALES ON THEM LIKE ALL THE REST OF HIS BODY POLYCHROME MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT QUOX WAS DEAD HAD SHE NOT KNOWN THAT DRAGONS DO NOT DIE EASILY
1373-135029-0023 SHE PICKED UP A PIECE OF ROCK AND POUNDED AGAINST HIS EYELIDS WITH IT SAYING WAKE UP QUOX WAKE UP BUT HE WOULD NOT WAKEN DEAR ME HOW UNFORTUNATE SIGHED THE LOVELY RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER
1373-135029-0024 I WONDER WHAT IS THE BEST AND SUREST WAY TO WAKEN A DRAGON
1373-135029-0025 SHE WALKED AROUND QUOX TWO OR THREE TIMES TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME TENDER PLACE ON HIS BODY WHERE A THUMP OR A PUNCH MIGHT BE FELT BUT HE LAY EXTENDED ALONG THE ROCKS WITH HIS CHIN FLAT UPON THE GROUND AND HIS LEGS DRAWN UNDERNEATH HIS BODY
1373-135029-0026 AND HIS SILVER SCALES THEN DESPAIRING AT LAST OF WAKENING THE BEAST AND WORRIED OVER THE FATE OF HER FRIENDS POLYCHROME AGAIN RAN DOWN TO THE ENTRANCE AND HURRIED ALONG THE PASSAGE INTO THE NOME KING'S CAVERN HERE SHE FOUND RUGGEDO
1373-135029-0027 AND RANGED BEFORE THE KING WERE THE ROSE PRINCESS FILES AND THE SHAGGY MAN TIK TOK STILL LAY UPON THE FLOOR WEIGHTED DOWN BY THE BIG DIAMOND RUGGEDO WAS NOW IN A MORE CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND
1373-135029-0028 ONE BY ONE HE HAD MET THE INVADERS AND EASILY CAPTURED THEM THE DREADED LOVE MAGNET WAS INDEED IN SHAGGY'S POCKET ONLY A FEW FEET AWAY FROM THE KING BUT SHAGGY WAS POWERLESS TO SHOW IT
1373-135029-0029 AND UNLESS RUGGEDO'S EYES BEHELD THE TALISMAN IT COULD NOT AFFECT HIM AS FOR BETSY BOBBIN AND HER MULE HE BELIEVED KALIKO HAD PLACED THEM IN THE SLIMY CAVE WHILE ANN AND HER OFFICERS HE THOUGHT SAFELY IMPRISONED IN THE PIT
1373-135029-0030 RUGGEDO HAD NO FEAR OF FILES OR OZGA BUT TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE HE HAD ORDERED GOLDEN HANDCUFFS PLACED UPON THEIR WRISTS THESE DID NOT CAUSE THEM ANY GREAT ANNOYANCE BUT PREVENTED THEM FROM MAKING AN ATTACK HAD THEY BEEN INCLINED TO DO SO
1373-135029-0031 THE NOME KING THINKING HIMSELF WHOLLY MASTER OF THE SITUATION WAS LAUGHING AND JEERING AT HIS PRISONERS WHEN POLYCHROME EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL AND DANCING LIKE A RAY OF LIGHT ENTERED THE CAVERN OHO CRIED THE KING A
1373-135029-0032 AND ARRANGED HIS WHISKERS ON MY WORD SAID HE YOU ARE A VERY CAPTIVATING CREATURE MOREOVER I PERCEIVE YOU ARE A FAIRY I AM POLYCHROME THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER SHE SAID PROUDLY
1373-135029-0033 WELL REPLIED RUGGEDO I LIKE YOU THE OTHERS I HATE I HATE EVERYBODY BUT YOU WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO LIVE ALWAYS IN THIS BEAUTIFUL CAVERN POLYCHROME SEE THE JEWELS THAT STUD THE WALLS HAVE EVERY TINT AND COLOR OF YOUR RAINBOW
1373-135029-0034 AND THEY ARE NOT SO ELUSIVE I'LL HAVE FRESH DEWDROPS GATHERED FOR YOUR FEASTING EVERY DAY
1373-135029-0035 NO THANK YOU LAUGHED POLYCHROME MY HOME IS IN THE SKY AND I'M ONLY ON A VISIT TO THIS SOLID SORDID EARTH BUT TELL ME RUGGEDO WHY MY FRIENDS HAVE BEEN WOUND WITH CORDS AND BOUND WITH CHAINS
1373-135029-0036 THEN SINCE THEY ARE NOW HELPLESS WHY NOT RELEASE THEM AND SEND THEM BACK TO THE EARTH'S SURFACE BECAUSE I HATE EM AND MEAN TO MAKE EM SUFFER FOR THEIR INVASION BUT I'LL MAKE A BARGAIN WITH YOU SWEET POLLY REMAIN HERE AND LIVE WITH ME
1373-135029-0037 AND I'LL SET ALL THESE PEOPLE FREE YOU SHALL BE MY DAUGHTER OR MY WIFE OR MY AUNT OR GRANDMOTHER WHICHEVER YOU LIKE ONLY STAY HERE TO BRIGHTEN MY GLOOMY KINGDOM AND MAKE ME HAPPY POLYCHROME LOOKED AT HIM WONDERINGLY
1373-135029-0038 THEN SHE TURNED TO SHAGGY AND ASKED ARE YOU SURE HE HASN'T SEEN THE LOVE MAGNET I'M POSITIVE ANSWERED SHAGGY BUT YOU SEEM TO BE SOMETHING OF A LOVE MAGNET YOURSELF POLYCHROME SHE LAUGHED AGAIN AND SAID TO RUGGEDO
1373-135029-0039 NOT EVEN TO RESCUE MY FRIENDS WOULD I LIVE IN YOUR KINGDOM
1373-135029-0040 THE SOCIETY OF SUCH A WICKED MONSTER AS YOU YOU FORGET RETORTED THE KING SCOWLING DARKLY THAT YOU ALSO ARE IN MY POWER NOT SO RUGGEDO
1373-135029-0041 THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER IS BEYOND THE REACH OF YOUR SPITE OR MALICE
1373-135029-0042 HER HIS HANDS MET IN AIR AND NOW THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER WAS IN ANOTHER PART OF THE ROOM AS SMILING AND COMPOSED AS BEFORE
1373-135029-0043 AND RUGGEDO EVEN CAME DOWN FROM HIS THRONE TO ASSIST HIS GENERAL BUT NEVER COULD THEY LAY HANDS UPON THE LOVELY SKY FAIRY WHO FLITTED HERE AND THERE WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF LIGHT AND CONSTANTLY DEFIED THEM WITH HER MERRY LAUGHTER AS SHE EVADED THEIR EFFORTS
1373-135029-0044 SO AFTER A TIME THEY ABANDONED THE CHASE AND RUGGEDO RETURNED TO HIS THRONE AND WIPED THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS FACE WITH A FINELY WOVEN HANDKERCHIEF OF CLOTH OF GOLD WELL SAID POLYCHROME WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO NOW
1373-135029-0045 I'M GOING TO HAVE SOME FUN TO REPAY ME FOR ALL MY BOTHER REPLIED THE NOME KING THEN HE SAID TO KALIKO SUMMON THE EXECUTIONERS KALIKO AT ONCE WITHDREW AND PRESENTLY RETURNED WITH A SCORE OF NOMES
1373-135029-0046 ALL OF WHOM WERE NEARLY AS EVIL LOOKING AS THEIR HATED MASTER THEY BORE GREAT GOLDEN PINCERS AND PRODS OF SILVER AND CLAMPS AND CHAINS AND VARIOUS WICKED LOOKING INSTRUMENTS
1373-135029-0047 ALL MADE OF PRECIOUS METALS AND SET WITH DIAMONDS AND RUBIES NOW PANG SAID RUGGEDO ADDRESSING THE LEADER OF THE EXECUTIONERS FETCH THE ARMY OF OOGABOO AND THEIR QUEEN FROM THE PIT AND TORTURE THEM HERE IN MY PRESENCE
1373-135029-0048 AS WELL AS IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR FRIENDS IT WILL BE GREAT SPORT I HEAR YOUR MAJESTY AND I OBEY YOUR MAJESTY ANSWERED PANG AND WENT WITH HIS NOMES INTO THE PASSAGE IN A FEW MINUTES HE RETURNED
1373-135029-0049 AND BOWED TO RUGGEDO THEY'RE ALL GONE SAID HE
1373-135029-0050 GONE WHERE THEY LEFT NO ADDRESS YOUR MAJESTY BUT THEY ARE NOT IN THE PIT
1373-135029-0051 NO ONE SAID PANG THE COVER WAS THERE BUT THE PRISONERS WERE NOT UNDER IT IN THAT CASE SNARLED THE KING
1373-135029-0052 AND FETCH HITHER THE GIRL AND THE DONKEY
1373-135029-0053 KALIKO WENT AWAY LOOKING SAD AND DISTURBED FOR HE KNEW THE KING WAS CRUEL AND UNJUST ENOUGH TO CARRY OUT THIS THREAT
1373-135029-0054 NOR WAS HANK THERE IS NO ONE IN THE SLIMY CAVE YOUR MAJESTY
1373-135029-0055 THERE IS BUT ONE SLIMY CAVE AND THERE IS NO ONE IN IT RETURNED PANG POSITIVELY RUGGEDO WAS BEGINNING TO BE ALARMED AS WELL AS ANGRY HOWEVER THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS BUT MADE HIM THE MORE VINDICTIVE
1373-135029-0056 AND HE CAST AN EVIL LOOK AT THE OTHER PRISONERS AND SAID NEVER MIND THE GIRL AND THE DONKEY HERE ARE FOUR AT LEAST WHO CANNOT ESCAPE MY VENGEANCE LET ME SEE I BELIEVE I'LL CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT TIK TOK
1373-135029-0057 HAVE THE GOLD CRUCIBLE HEATED TO A WHITE SEETHING HEAT AND THEN WE'LL DUMP THE COPPER MAN INTO IT AND MELT HIM UP BUT YOUR MAJESTY PROTESTED KALIKO WHO HAD RETURNED TO THE ROOM AFTER SENDING A HUNDRED NOMES TO SEARCH FOR THE OOGABOO PEOPLE
1373-135029-0058 IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO DEPRIVE THE WORLD OF SUCH A CLEVER CONTRIVANCE
1373-135029-0059 ROARED THE KING I'M GETTING TIRED OF YOU KALIKO AND THE FIRST THING YOU KNOW I'LL TURN YOU INTO A POTATO AND MAKE SARATOGA CHIPS OF YOU THE NEXT TO CONSIDER HE ADDED MORE MILDLY IS THE SHAGGY MAN
1373-135029-0060 AS HE OWNS THE LOVE MAGNET I THINK I'LL TRANSFORM HIM INTO A DOVE AND THEN WE CAN PRACTICE SHOOTING AT HIM WITH TIK TOK'S GUN
1373-135029-0061 HE CAME OUT OF HIS THRONE TO STAND BEFORE THE SHAGGY MAN AND THEN HE WAVED HIS HANDS PALMS DOWNWARD IN SEVEN SEMICIRCLES OVER HIS VICTIM'S HEAD SAYING IN A LOW BUT CLEAR TONE OF VOICE THE MAGIC WUGWA
1373-135029-0062 THE EFFECT OF THIS WELL KNOWN SORCERY WAS INSTANTANEOUS INSTEAD OF THE SHAGGY MAN A PRETTY DOVE LAY FLUTTERING UPON THE FLOOR ITS WINGS CONFINED BY TINY CORDS WOUND AROUND THEM
1373-135029-0063 WITH A PAIR OF SCISSORS BEING FREED THE DOVE QUICKLY FLEW UPWARD
1373-135029-0064 RUBBING HIS HANDS GLEEFULLY TOGETHER ONE ENEMY IS OUT OF MY WAY AND NOW FOR THE OTHERS PERHAPS MY READERS SHOULD BE WARNED NOT TO ATTEMPT THE ABOVE TRANSFORMATION FOR
1373-135029-0065 ALTHOUGH THE EXACT MAGICAL FORMULA HAS BEEN DESCRIBED IT IS UNLAWFUL IN ALL CIVILIZED COUNTRIES FOR ANYONE TO TRANSFORM A PERSON INTO A DOVE BY MUTTERING THE WORDS RUGGEDO USED THERE WERE NO LAWS TO PREVENT THE NOME KING FROM PERFORMING THIS TRANSFORMATION
1373-135029-0066 BUT IF IT SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY AND THE MAGIC WORKED THE MAGICIAN WOULD BE SEVERELY PUNISHED WHEN POLYCHROME SAW SHAGGY MAN TRANSFORMED INTO A DOVE
1373-135029-0067 AND THAT TIK TOK WOULD SOON BE MELTED IN A CRUCIBLE
