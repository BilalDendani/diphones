5375-40170-0000 THE FEW INTERVENING DAYS THAT LAY BETWEEN COMMENCEMENT AND HOME WERE FILLED WITH PLENTY OF PLEASANT EXCITEMENT THERE WERE CALLS TO MAKE FAREWELL SPREADS AND MERRY MAKINGS TO ATTEND AND MOMENTOUS QUESTIONS CONCERNING WHAT TO LEAVE BEHIND
5375-40170-0001 AND WHAT TO TAKE HOME TO BE DECIDED THE MAJORITY OF THE GIRLS AT WAYNE HALL HAD ASKED FOR THEIR OLD ROOMS FOR THE NEXT YEAR TWO SOPHOMORES HAD SUCCEEDED IN GETTING INTO WELLINGTON HOUSE
5375-40170-0002 ONE POOR LITTLE FRESHMAN HAVING STUDIED TOO HARD HAD BROUGHT ON A NERVOUS AFFECTION AND WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE UP HER COURSE AT OVERTON FOR A YEAR AT LEAST THERE WAS ALSO ONE OTHER SOPHOMORE WHOSE MOTHER WAS COMING TO THE TOWN OF OVERTON TO LIVE
5375-40170-0003 AND KEEP HOUSE FOR HER DAUGHTER IN A BUNGALOW NOT FAR FROM THE COLLEGE IT NOW LACKED ONLY TWO DAYS UNTIL THE END OF THE SPRING TERM AND WHAT TO PACK AND WHEN TO PACK IT WERE THE BURNING QUESTIONS OF THE HOUR
5375-40170-0004 HER ARMS PILED HIGH WITH SKIRTS AND GOWNS DEPOSITING THEM ON THE FLOOR
5375-40170-0005 I DON'T BELIEVE I CAN EVER MAKE ALL THOSE THINGS GO INTO THAT TRUNK I HAVE ALL MY CLOTHES THAT I BROUGHT HERE LAST FALL AND ANOTHER LOT THAT I BROUGHT BACK AT CHRISTMAS
5375-40170-0006 IF I HAD HAD A PARTICLE OF FORETHOUGHT I WOULD HAVE TAKEN HOME A FEW THINGS EACH TRIP DON'T DARE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE UNTIL THIS TRUNK IS PACKED ANNE FOR I SHALL NEED YOU TO HELP ME SIT ON IT IF OUR COMBINED WEIGHT ISN'T ENOUGH
5375-40170-0007 WE'LL INVITE ELFREDA AND MIRIAM IN TO THE SITTING I AM PERFECTLY WILLING TO PERFORM THE SAME KIND OFFICES FOR THEM OH DEAR I HATE TO BEGIN I'M WILD TO GO HOME BUT I CAN'T HELP FEELING SAD TO THINK MY FRESHMAN JOYS ARE OVER
5375-40170-0008 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT YEARS IN COLLEGE ARE ONE'S FRESHMAN AND SENIOR YEARS BEING A FRESHMAN IS LIKE BEGINNING A GARDEN ONE PLANTS WHAT ONE CONSIDERS THE BEST SEEDS AND WHEN THE LITTLE GREEN SHOOTS COME UP
5375-40170-0009 IT IS ONLY BY CONSTANT CARE THAT THEY ARE MADE TO THRIVE AND ALL SORTS OF STORMS ARE LIKELY TO RISE OUT OF A CLEAR SKY AND BLIGHT THEM SOME OF THE SEEDS ONE THOUGHT WOULD SURELY GROW THE FASTEST ARE TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENTS WHILE OTHERS THAT ONE JUST PLANTED TO FILL IN
5375-40170-0010 FAIRLY ASTONISH ONE BY THEIR GROWTH
5375-40170-0011 IT'S SAFE TO SAY IT WILL KEEP ON GROWING THROUGH THE SOPHOMORE AND JUNIOR YEARS AND BLOOM AT THE END OF FOUR YEARS THAT'S THE PECULIARITY ABOUT COLLEGE GARDENS ONE HAS TO BEGIN TO PLANT THE VERY FIRST DAY OF THE FRESHMAN YEAR TO BE SURE OF FLOWERS WHEN THE FOUR YEARS ARE OVER
5375-40170-0012 IN THE SOPHOMORE YEAR THE HARDEST TASK IS KEEPING THE WEEDS OUT
5375-40170-0013 IT WILL BE EASIER TO NEGLECT ONE'S GARDEN THEN
5375-40170-0014 GRACE LAID THE GOWN SHE HAD BEEN FOLDING IN THE TRUNK AND LOOKED EARNESTLY AT ANNE AS SHE FINISHED HER LONG SPEECH WHAT A NICE IDEA EXCLAIMED ANNE WARMLY I THINK I SHALL HAVE TO BEGIN GARDENING TOO
5375-40170-0015 YOUR GARDEN HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN A FLOURISHING CONDITION FROM THE FIRST LAUGHED GRACE THE CHIEF TROUBLE WITH MINE
5375-40170-0016 NETTLES THAT I NEVER PLANTED BUT THAT STING JUST AS SHARPLY NEVERTHELESS IT HURTS ME TO GO HOME WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE TWO GIRLS HERE WHO DON'T LIKE ME I KNOW I OUGHT NOT TO CARE FOR I HAVE NOTHING TO REGRET AS FAR AS MY OWN CONDUCT IS CONCERNED
5375-40170-0017 PERHAPS WHEN CERTAIN GIRLS COME BACK IN THE FALL THEY WILL BE ON THEIR GOOD BEHAVIOR PERHAPS REPEATED GRACE SCEPTICALLY THE ENTRANCE INTO THE ROOM OF ELFREDA AND MIRIAM WHO HAD BEEN OUT SHOPPING
5375-40170-0018 WE'VE A NEW KIND OF CAKES EXULTED MIRIAM THEY ARE THREE STORIES HIGH AND EACH STORY IS A DIFFERENT COLOR THEY HAVE ICING HALF AN INCH THICK AND AN ENGLISH WALNUT ON TOP
5375-40170-0019 WE BOUGHT A DOZEN DECLARED ELFREDA AND NOW I'M GOING OUT TO BUY ICE CREAM
5375-40170-0020 I'VE THOUGHT OF A LOVELY PLAN TO LIGHTEN MY LABORS
5375-40170-0021 THIS IS PRACTICAL ANNOUNCED THE STOUT GIRL I'M GOING TO GIVE AWAY MY CLOTHES
5375-40170-0022 I FOUND A POOR WOMAN THE OTHER DAY WHO DOES SCRUBBING FOR THE COLLEGE WHO NEEDS THEM I FOUND OUT WHERE SHE LIVES AND I'M GOING TO BUNDLE THEM ALL TOGETHER AND SEND THEM TO HER
5375-40170-0023 I'LL JUST WRITE A CARD AND THE THREE BROADLY SMILING FACES OF HER FRIENDS CAUSED HER TO STOP SHORT AND REGARD THEM SUSPICIOUSLY WHAT'S THE MATTER SHE SAID IN AN OFFENDED TONE GRACE RAN OVER AND SLIPPED HER ARM ABOUT THE STOUT GIRL'S SHOULDERS
5375-40170-0024 YOU ARE THE ONE WHO SENT RUTH HER LOVELY CLOTHES LAST CHRISTMAS DON'T TRY TO DENY IT I WAS SURE OF IT THEN
5375-40170-0025 YOU CONFESS THREATENED MIRIAM SEIZING THE LITTLE BRASS TEA KETTLE AND BRANDISHING IT OVER ELFREDA'S HEAD I WON'T DEFIED ELFREDA
5375-40170-0026 ONE TWO COUNTED MIRIAM GRASPING THE KETTLE FIRMLY ALL RIGHT I DID CONFESSED ELFREDA NONCHALANTLY
5375-40170-0027 PRESENT YOU WITH YOUR CHRISTMAS GIFTS NOW SMILED MIRIAM YOU WOULDN'T LOOK AT US LAST CHRISTMAS SO WE'VE BEEN SAVING OUR GIFTS EVER SINCE WAIT A MINUTE GIRLS UNTIL I GO FOR MINE AS SHE DARTED FROM THE ROOM GRACE SAID SOFTLY
5375-40170-0028 WE HOPED THAT YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND ABOUT THANKSGIVING AND THAT EVERYTHING WOULD BE ALL RIGHT BY CHRISTMAS
5375-40170-0029 THEN WHEN WHEN WE DIDN'T SEE YOU BEFORE GOING HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS ANNE SUGGESTED THAT WE PUT THEM AWAY BECAUSE WE ALL HOPED THAT YOU'D BE FRIENDS WITH US AGAIN SOME DAY RUMMAGING IN THE TRAY OF HER TRUNK SHE PRODUCED A LONG FLAT PACKAGE WHICH SHE OFFERED TO ELFREDA
5375-40170-0030 ANNE WHO AT GRACE'S FIRST WORDS HAD STEPPED TO THE CHIFFONIER TOOK OUT A BERIBBONED BUNDLE AND STOOD HOLDING IT TOWARD THE STOUT GIRL ANOTHER MOMENT AND MIRIAM HAD RETURNED BEARING HER OFFERING
5375-40170-0031 I WISH YOU A MERRY JUNE DECLARED MIRIAM WITH AN INFECTIOUS GIGGLE THAT WAS ECHOED BY THE OTHERS THEN ELFREDA OPENED THE PACKAGE FROM MIRIAM WHICH CONTAINED A JAPANESE SILK KIMONO SIMILAR TO ONE OF HER OWN THAT HER ROOMMATE HAD GREATLY ADMIRED
5375-40170-0032 GRACE'S PACKAGE CONTAINED A PAIR OF LONG WHITE GLOVES AND ANNE HAD REMEMBERED HER WITH A BOOK SHE HAD ONCE HEARD THE STOUT GIRL EXPRESS A DESIRE TO OWN YOU HAD NO BUSINESS TO DO IT MUTTERED ELFREDA THEN GATHERING UP HER PRESENTS
5375-40170-0033 SHE MADE A DASH FOR THE DOOR AND WITH A MUFFLED I'LL BE BACK SOON WAS GONE IT WAS SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE SHE REAPPEARED WITH RED EYES BUT SMILING LIPS THEN A LONG TALK ENSUED DURING WHICH TIME THE ART OF TRUNK PACKING LANGUISHED
5375-40170-0034 IT WAS RENEWED WITH VIGOR THAT EVENING AND CONTINUED SPASMODICALLY FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS IN THE CAMPUS HOUSES THE REAL PACKING DRAGGED ALONG IN MOST INSTANCES UNTIL WITHIN TWO HOURS OF THE TIME WHEN THE TRUNKS WERE TO BE CALLED FOR
5375-40170-0035 THEN A WHOLESALE SCRAMBLE BEGAN TO MAKE UP FOR LOST MINUTES ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENT AND PAINFUL SIGHTS DURING THOSE LAST TWO DAYS WAS THAT OF A WRATHFUL EXPRESSMAN GLARING IN IMPOTENT RAGE WHILE AN ENTERPRISING DAMSEL OPENED HER TRUNK
5375-40170-0036 ON THE FRONT PORCH TO TAKE OUT OR PUT IN ONE OR SEVERAL OF HER VARIOUS POSSESSIONS WHICH UNTIL THAT MOMENT HAD BEEN COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN THE NIGHT BEFORE LEAVING OVERTON THE FOUR GIRLS PAID A VISIT TO RUTH DENTON

5375-40170-0038 STOOD AT THE WINDOW LOOKING OUT AT THE GLORY OF THE SPARKLING JUNE DAY THE CAMPUS WAS A VAST GREEN VELVET CARPET AND THE PALE GREEN OF THE TREES HAD NOT YET CHANGED TO THAT DARKER DUSTIER SHADE THAT BELONGS ONLY TO SUMMER
5375-40170-0039 GRACE'S HEART SWELLED WITH PRIDE AS SHE GAZED AT THE STATELY OLD BUILDING SURROUNDED BY ITS SILENT LEAFY GUARD OVERTON MY ALMA MATER SHE SAID SOFTLY

5375-40170-0042 PLACING HER HAND ON HER FRIEND'S SHOULDER A LITTLE LATER LADEN WITH BAGS AND SUIT CASES THE THREE OAKDALE GIRLS ACCOMPANIED BY ELFREDA

5375-40170-0044 THAT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE TO CONSIDER BESIDES MYSELF THAT IS WHAT BEING A FRESHMAN AT OVERTON HAS TAUGHT ME
