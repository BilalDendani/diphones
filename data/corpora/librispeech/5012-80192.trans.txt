5012-80192-0000 MAD INDEED WOULD I BE TO EXPECT IT IN A CASE WHERE MY VERY SENSES REJECT THEIR OWN EVIDENCE YET MAD AM I NOT AND VERY SURELY DO I NOT DREAM BUT TOMORROW I DIE AND TODAY I WOULD UNBURTHEN MY SOUL
5012-80192-0001 MY IMMEDIATE PURPOSE IS TO PLACE BEFORE THE WORLD PLAINLY SUCCINCTLY AND WITHOUT COMMENT A SERIES OF MERE HOUSEHOLD EVENTS IN THEIR CONSEQUENCES THESE EVENTS HAVE TERRIFIED HAVE TORTURED HAVE DESTROYED ME
5012-80192-0002 YET I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO EXPOUND THEM TO ME THEY PRESENTED LITTLE BUT HORROR TO MANY THEY WILL SEEM LESS TERRIBLE THAN BAROQUES HEREAFTER PERHAPS SOME INTELLECT MAY BE FOUND WHICH WILL REDUCE MY PHANTASM TO THE COMMONPLACE
5012-80192-0003 SOME INTELLECT MORE CALM MORE LOGICAL AND FAR LESS EXCITABLE THAN MY OWN WHICH WILL PERCEIVE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DETAIL WITH AWE NOTHING MORE THAN AN ORDINARY SUCCESSION OF VERY NATURAL CAUSES AND EFFECTS
5012-80192-0004 FROM MY INFANCY I WAS NOTED FOR THE DOCILITY AND HUMANITY OF MY DISPOSITION MY TENDERNESS OF HEART WAS EVEN SO CONSPICUOUS AS TO MAKE ME THE JEST OF MY COMPANIONS
5012-80192-0005 THIS PECULIARITY OF CHARACTER GREW WITH MY GROWTH AND IN MY MANHOOD I DERIVED FROM IT ONE OF MY PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF PLEASURE TO THOSE WHO HAVE CHERISHED AN AFFECTION FOR A FAITHFUL AND SAGACIOUS DOG
5012-80192-0006 WHICH GOES DIRECTLY TO THE HEART OF HIM WHO HAS HAD FREQUENT OCCASION TO TEST THE PALTRY FRIENDSHIP AND GOSSAMER FIDELITY OF MERE MAN
5012-80192-0007 OBSERVING MY PARTIALITY FOR DOMESTIC PETS SHE LOST NO OPPORTUNITY OF PROCURING THOSE OF THE MOST AGREEABLE KIND WE HAD BIRDS GOLD FISH A FINE DOG RABBITS A SMALL MONKEY AND A CAT
5012-80192-0008 THIS LATTER WAS A REMARKABLY LARGE AND BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL ENTIRELY BLACK AND SAGACIOUS TO AN ASTONISHING DEGREE IN SPEAKING OF HIS INTELLIGENCE MY WIFE WHO AT HEART WAS NOT A LITTLE TINCTURED WITH SUPERSTITION
5012-80192-0009 MADE FREQUENT ALLUSION TO THE ANCIENT POPULAR NOTION WHICH REGARDED ALL BLACK CATS AS WITCHES IN DISGUISE NOT THAT SHE WAS EVER SERIOUS UPON THIS POINT AND I MENTION THE MATTER AT ALL FOR NO BETTER REASON THAN THAT IT HAPPENS JUST NOW TO BE REMEMBERED PLUTO
5012-80192-0010 THIS WAS THE CAT'S NAME WAS MY FAVOURITE PET AND PLAYMATE I ALONE FED HIM AND HE ATTENDED ME WHEREVER I WENT ABOUT THE HOUSE IT WAS EVEN WITH DIFFICULTY THAT I COULD PREVENT HIM FROM FOLLOWING ME THROUGH THE STREETS
5012-80192-0011 OUR FRIENDSHIP LASTED IN THIS MANNER FOR SEVERAL YEARS DURING WHICH MY GENERAL TEMPERAMENT AND CHARACTER THROUGH THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF THE FIEND INTEMPERANCE HAD I BLUSH TO CONFESS IT EXPERIENCED A RADICAL ALTERATION FOR THE WORSE
5012-80192-0012 I GREW DAY BY DAY MORE MOODY MORE IRRITABLE MORE REGARDLESS OF THE FEELINGS OF OTHERS I SUFFERED MYSELF TO USE INTEMPERATE LANGUAGE TO MY WIFE AT LENGTH I EVEN OFFERED HER PERSONAL VIOLENCE
5012-80192-0013 MY PETS OF COURSE WERE MADE TO FEEL THE CHANGE IN MY DISPOSITION I NOT ONLY NEGLECTED BUT ILL USED THEM FOR PLUTO HOWEVER I STILL RETAINED SUFFICIENT REGARD TO RESTRAIN ME FROM MALTREATING HIM
5012-80192-0014 AS I MADE NO SCRUPLE OF MALTREATING THE RABBITS THE MONKEY OR EVEN THE DOG WHEN BY ACCIDENT OR THROUGH AFFECTION THEY CAME IN MY WAY BUT MY DISEASE GREW UPON ME FOR WHAT DISEASE IS LIKE ALCOHOL
5012-80192-0015 AND AT LENGTH EVEN PLUTO WHO WAS NOW BECOMING OLD AND CONSEQUENTLY SOMEWHAT PEEVISH EVEN PLUTO BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE THE EFFECTS OF MY ILL TEMPER ONE NIGHT RETURNING HOME MUCH INTOXICATED FROM ONE OF MY HAUNTS ABOUT TOWN
5012-80192-0016 I FANCIED THAT THE CAT AVOIDED MY PRESENCE I SEIZED HIM WHEN IN HIS FRIGHT AT MY VIOLENCE HE INFLICTED A SLIGHT WOUND UPON MY HAND WITH HIS TEETH THE FURY OF A DEMON INSTANTLY POSSESSED ME I KNEW MYSELF NO LONGER
5012-80192-0017 MY ORIGINAL SOUL SEEMED AT ONCE TO TAKE ITS FLIGHT FROM MY BODY AND A MORE THAN FIENDISH MALEVOLENCE GIN NURTURED THRILLED EVERY FIBER OF MY FRAME I TOOK FROM MY WAISTCOAT POCKET A PENKNIFE OPENED IT
5012-80192-0018 GRASPED THE POOR BEAST BY THE THROAT AND DELIBERATELY CUT ONE OF ITS EYES FROM THE SOCKET I BLUSH I BURN I SHUDDER WHILE I PEN THE DAMNABLE ATROCITY WHEN REASON RETURNED WITH THE MORNING
5012-80192-0019 I EXPERIENCED A SENTIMENT HALF OF HORROR HALF OF REMORSE FOR THE CRIME OF WHICH I HAD BEEN GUILTY BUT IT WAS AT BEST A FEEBLE AND EQUIVOCAL FEELING AND THE SOUL REMAINED UNTOUCHED
5012-80192-0020 I AGAIN PLUNGED INTO EXCESS AND SOON DROWNED IN WINE ALL MEMORY OF THE DEED IN THE MEANTIME THE CAT SLOWLY RECOVERED THE SOCKET OF THE LOST EYE PRESENTED IT IS TRUE A FRIGHTFUL APPEARANCE
5012-80192-0021 BUT HE NO LONGER APPEARED TO SUFFER ANY PAIN HE WENT ABOUT THE HOUSE AS USUAL BUT AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED FLED IN EXTREME TERROR AT MY APPROACH I HAD SO MUCH OF MY OLD HEART LEFT AS TO BE AT FIRST GRIEVED BY THIS EVIDENT DISLIKE ON THE PART OF A CREATURE
5012-80192-0022 YET I AM NOT MORE SURE THAT MY SOUL LIVES THAN I AM THAT PERVERSENESS IS ONE OF THE PRIMITIVE IMPULSES OF THE HUMAN HEART ONE OF THE INDIVISIBLE PRIMARY FACULTIES OR SENTIMENTS WHICH GAVE DIRECTION TO THE CHARACTER OF MAN
5012-80192-0023 WHO HAS NOT A HUNDRED TIMES FOUND HIMSELF COMMITTING A VILE OR A SILLY ACTION FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE SHOULD NOT HAVE WE NOT A PERPETUAL INCLINATION IN THE TEETH OF OUR BEST JUDGMENT TO VIOLATE THAT WHICH IS LAW
5012-80192-0024 MERELY BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND IT TO BE SUCH THIS SPIRIT OF PERVERSENESS I SAY CAME TO MY FINAL OVERTHROW IT WAS THIS UNFATHOMABLE LONGING OF THE SOUL TO VEX ITSELF TO OFFER VIOLENCE TO ITS OWN NATURE
5012-80192-0025 TO DO WRONG FOR THE WRONG'S SAKE ONLY THAT URGED ME TO CONTINUE AND FINALLY TO CONSUMMATE THE INJURY I HAD INFLICTED UPON THE UNOFFENDING BRUTE ONE MORNING IN COOL BLOOD I SLIPPED A NOOSE ABOUT ITS NECK AND HUNG IT TO THE LIMB OF A TREE
5012-80192-0026 HUNG IT WITH THE TEARS STREAMING FROM MY EYES AND WITH THE BITTEREST REMORSE AT MY HEART HUNG IT BECAUSE I KNEW IT HAD LOVED ME AND BECAUSE I FELT IT HAD GIVEN ME NO REASON OF OFFENCE
5012-80192-0027 A DEADLY SIN THAT WOULD SO JEOPARDIZE MY IMMORTAL SOUL AS TO PLACE IT IF SUCH A THING WERE POSSIBLE EVEN BEYOND THE REACH OF THE INFINITE MERCY OF THE MOST MERCIFUL AND MOST TERRIBLE GOD ON THE NIGHT OF THE DAY ON WHICH THIS CRUEL DEED WAS DONE
5012-80192-0028 I WAS AROUSED FROM SLEEP BY THE CRY OF FIRE THE CURTAINS OF MY BED WERE IN FLAMES THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS BLAZING IT WAS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT MY WIFE A SERVANT AND MYSELF MADE OUR ESCAPE FROM THE CONFLAGRATION
5012-80192-0029 THIS EXCEPTION WAS FOUND IN A COMPARTMENT WALL NOT VERY THICK WHICH STOOD ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUSE AND AGAINST WHICH HAD RESTED THE HEAD OF MY BED THE PLASTERING HAD HERE IN GREAT MEASURE RESISTED THE ACTION OF THE FIRE
5012-80192-0030 A FACT WHICH I ATTRIBUTED TO ITS HAVING RECENTLY SPREAD ABOUT THIS WALL A DENSE CROWD WERE COLLECTED AND MANY PERSONS SEEMED TO BE EXAMINING A PARTICULAR PORTION OF IT WITH VERY MINUTE AND EAGER ATTENTION THE WORDS STRANGE
5012-80192-0031 SINGULAR AND OTHER SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS EXCITED MY CURIOSITY
5012-80192-0032 CAT THE IMPRESSION WAS GIVEN WITH AN ACCURACY TRULY MARVELLOUS THERE WAS A ROPE ABOUT THE ANIMAL'S NECK WHEN I FIRST BEHELD THIS APPARITION FOR I COULD SCARCELY REGARD IT AS LESS MY WONDER AND MY TERROR WERE EXTREME
5012-80192-0033 BUT AT LENGTH REFLECTION CAME TO MY AID THE CAT I REMEMBERED HAD BEEN HUNG IN A GARDEN ADJACENT TO THE HOUSE UPON THE ALARM OF FIRE THIS GARDEN HAD BEEN IMMEDIATELY FILLED BY THE CROWD
5012-80192-0034 BY SOME ONE OF WHOM THE ANIMAL MUST HAVE BEEN CUT FROM THE TREE AND THROWN THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW INTO MY CHAMBER THIS HAD PROBABLY BEEN DONE WITH THE VIEW OF AROUSING ME FROM SLEEP
5012-80192-0035 THE FALLING OF OTHER WALLS HAD COMPRESSED THE VICTIM OF MY CRUELTY INTO THE SUBSTANCE OF THE FRESHLY SPREAD PLASTER THE LIME OF WHICH WITH THE FLAMES AND THE AMMONIA FROM THE CARCASS HAD THEN ACCOMPLISHED THE PORTRAITURE AS I SAW IT
5012-80192-0036 FOR MONTHS I COULD NOT RID MYSELF OF THE PHANTASM OF THE CAT AND DURING THIS PERIOD THERE CAME BACK INTO MY SPIRIT A HALF SENTIMENT THAT SEEMED BUT WAS NOT REMORSE I WENT SO FAR AS TO REGRET THE LOSS OF THE ANIMAL
5012-80192-0037 AND TO LOOK ABOUT ME AMONG THE VILE HAUNTS WHICH I NOW HABITUALLY FREQUENTED FOR ANOTHER PET OF THE SAME SPECIES AND OF SOMEWHAT SIMILAR APPEARANCE WITH WHICH TO SUPPLY ITS PLACE
5012-80192-0038 ONE NIGHT AS I SAT HALF STUPEFIED IN A DEN OF MORE THAN INFAMY MY ATTENTION WAS SUDDENLY DRAWN TO SOME BLACK OBJECT REPOSING UPON THE HEAD OF ONE OF THE IMMENSE HOGSHEADS OF GIN OR OF RUM
5012-80192-0039 WHICH CONSTITUTED THE CHIEF FURNITURE OF THE APARTMENT I HAD BEEN LOOKING STEADILY AT THE TOP OF THIS HOGSHEAD FOR SOME MINUTES AND WHAT NOW CAUSED ME SURPRISE WAS THE FACT THAT I HAD NOT SOONER PERCEIVED THE OBJECT THEREUPON
5012-80192-0040 I APPROACHED IT AND TOUCHED IT WITH MY HAND IT WAS A BLACK CAT A VERY LARGE ONE FULLY AS LARGE AS PLUTO AND CLOSELY RESEMBLING HIM IN EVERY RESPECT BUT ONE
5012-80192-0041 PLUTO HAD NOT A WHITE HAIR UPON ANY PORTION OF HIS BODY BUT THIS CAT HAD A LARGE ALTHOUGH INDEFINITE SPLOTCH OF WHITE COVERING NEARLY THE WHOLE REGION OF THE BREAST
