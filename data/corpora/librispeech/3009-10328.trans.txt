3009-10328-0000 IT WOULD SEEM THAT ANGELS HAVE BODIES NATURALLY UNITED TO THEM
3009-10328-0001 THAT IS IT BELONGS TO THE FATHER THE SON AND THE HOLY GHOST AS A PROPERTY OF NATURE THAT HE IS UNDERSTOOD TO EXIST WITHOUT ANY MATERIAL SUBSTANCE AND WITHOUT
3009-10328-0002 NEEDS THE HELP OF ANY CORPOREAL ORGAN BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT EVERY CREATED SPIRIT NEEDS CORPOREAL SUBSTANCE
3009-10328-0003 IS AKIN TO THAT OF AERIAL BODIES BUT THE NATURE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS IS THE SAME THEREFORE ANGELS HAVE BODIES NATURALLY UNITED TO THEM
3009-10328-0004 INCORPOREAL I ANSWER THAT THE ANGELS HAVE NOT BODIES NATURALLY UNITED TO THEM FOR WHATEVER BELONGS TO ANY NATURE AS AN ACCIDENT
3009-10328-0005 WHILE REFUSING TO SAY SUCH A THING OF GOD FOLLOWED THE ABOVE OPINION OF OTHERS REGARDING THE OTHER SUBSTANCES BEING DECEIVED HERE AS HE WAS ALSO IN MANY OTHER POINTS BY FOLLOWING THE OPINIONS OF THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHERS
3009-10328-0006 BERNARD'S EXPRESSION CAN BE EXPLAINED THAT THE CREATED SPIRIT NEEDS SOME BODILY INSTRUMENT WHICH IS NOT NATURALLY UNITED TO IT BUT ASSUMED FOR SOME PURPOSE AS WILL BE EXPLAINED
3009-10328-0007 NOT AS ASSERTING THE FACT BUT MERELY USING THE OPINION OF THE PLATONISTS WHO MAINTAINED THAT THERE ARE SOME AERIAL ANIMALS WHICH THEY TERMED DEMONS
3009-10328-0008 BECAUSE AN ANGEL HAS NO NEED FOR A BODY SINCE HIS OWN POWER EXCEEDS ALL BODILY POWER THEREFORE AN ANGEL DOES NOT ASSUME A BODY
3009-10328-0009 IT IS NOT SAID TO BE ASSUMED OTHERWISE IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT ALL BODIES MOVED BY THE ANGELS ARE ASSUMED BY THEM THEREFORE THE ANGELS DO NOT ASSUME BODIES
3009-10328-0010 ANGELS DO NOT ASSUME BODIES FROM THE EARTH OR WATER OR THEY COULD NOT SUDDENLY DISAPPEAR NOR AGAIN FROM FIRE OTHERWISE THEY WOULD BURN WHATEVER THINGS THEY TOUCHED NOR AGAIN FROM AIR BECAUSE AIR IS WITHOUT SHAPE OR COLOR
3009-10328-0011 THEREFORE THE ANGELS DO NOT ASSUME BODIES ON THE CONTRARY AUGUSTINE SAYS
3009-10328-0012 APPEARED TO ABRAHAM UNDER ASSUMED BODIES I ANSWER THAT SOME HAVE MAINTAINED THAT THE ANGELS NEVER ASSUME BODIES BUT THAT ALL THAT WE READ IN SCRIPTURE OF APPARITIONS OF ANGELS HAPPENED
3009-10328-0013 IN PROPHETIC VISION THAT IS ACCORDING TO IMAGINATION BUT THIS IS CONTRARY TO THE INTENT OF SCRIPTURE FOR WHATEVER IS BEHELD IN IMAGINARY VISION IS ONLY IN THE BEHOLDER'S IMAGINATION AND CONSEQUENTLY IS NOT SEEN BY EVERYBODY
3009-10328-0014 YET DIVINE SCRIPTURE FROM TIME TO TIME INTRODUCES ANGELS SO APPARENT AS TO BE SEEN COMMONLY BY ALL JUST AS THE ANGELS WHO APPEARED TO ABRAHAM WERE SEEN BY HIM AND BY HIS WHOLE FAMILY BY LOT AND BY THE CITIZENS OF SODOM
3009-10328-0015 IN LIKE MANNER THE ANGEL WHO APPEARED TO TOBIAS WAS SEEN BY ALL PRESENT FROM ALL THIS IT IS CLEARLY SHOWN THAT SUCH APPARITIONS WERE BEHELD BY BODILY VISION WHEREBY THE OBJECT SEEN EXISTS OUTSIDE THE PERSON BEHOLDING IT
3009-10328-0016 ANGELS NEED AN ASSUMED BODY NOT FOR THEMSELVES BUT ON OUR ACCOUNT THAT BY CONVERSING FAMILIARLY WITH MEN THEY MAY GIVE EVIDENCE OF THAT INTELLECTUAL COMPANIONSHIP WHICH MEN EXPECT TO HAVE WITH THEM IN THE LIFE TO COME
3009-10328-0017 MOREOVER THAT ANGELS ASSUMED BODIES UNDER THE OLD LAW WAS A FIGURATIVE INDICATION THAT THE WORD OF GOD WOULD TAKE A HUMAN BODY BECAUSE ALL THE APPARITIONS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT
3009-10328-0018 WERE ORDAINED TO THAT ONE WHEREBY THE SON OF GOD APPEARED IN THE FLESH
3009-10328-0019 THE BODY ASSUMED IS UNITED TO THE ANGEL NOT AS ITS FORM NOR MERELY AS ITS MOVER BUT AS ITS MOVER REPRESENTED BY THE ASSUMED MOVABLE BODY FOR AS IN THE SACRED SCRIPTURE THE PROPERTIES OF INTELLIGIBLE THINGS ARE SET FORTH
3009-10328-0020 BY THE LIKENESSES OF THINGS SENSIBLE IN THE SAME WAY BY DIVINE POWER SENSIBLE BODIES ARE SO FASHIONED BY ANGELS AS FITTINGLY TO REPRESENT THE INTELLIGIBLE PROPERTIES OF AN ANGEL AND THIS IS WHAT WE MEAN BY AN ANGEL ASSUMING A BODY
3009-10328-0021 ALTHOUGH AIR AS LONG AS IT IS IN A STATE OF RAREFACTION HAS NEITHER SHAPE NOR COLOR YET WHEN CONDENSED IT CAN BOTH BE SHAPED AND COLORED AS APPEARS IN THE CLOUDS EVEN SO THE ANGELS ASSUME BODIES OF AIR
3009-10328-0022 CONDENSING IT BY THE DIVINE POWER IN SO FAR
3009-10328-0023 THROUGH ASSUMED BODIES I ANSWER THAT SOME FUNCTIONS OF LIVING SUBJECTS HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH OTHER OPERATIONS JUST AS SPEECH WHICH IS THE FUNCTION OF A LIVING CREATURE AGREES WITH OTHER SOUNDS OF INANIMATE THINGS IN SO FAR
3009-10328-0024 AS IT IS SOUND AND WALKING AGREES WITH OTHER MOVEMENTS IN SO FAR AS IT IS MOVEMENT CONSEQUENTLY VITAL FUNCTIONS CAN BE PERFORMED IN ASSUMED BODIES BY THE ANGELS AS TO THAT WHICH IS COMMON IN SUCH OPERATIONS
3009-10328-0025 AS IT IS IN NO WISE CONTRARY TO TRUTH FOR INTELLIGIBLE THINGS TO BE SET FORTH IN SCRIPTURE UNDER SENSIBLE FIGURES SINCE IT IS NOT SAID FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAINTAINING THAT INTELLIGIBLE THINGS ARE SENSIBLE
3009-10328-0026 BUT IN ORDER THAT PROPERTIES OF INTELLIGIBLE THINGS MAY BE UNDERSTOOD ACCORDING TO SIMILITUDE THROUGH SENSIBLE FIGURES SO IT IS NOT CONTRARY TO THE TRUTH OF THE HOLY ANGELS THAT THROUGH THEIR ASSUMED BODIES THEY APPEAR TO BE LIVING MEN
3009-10328-0027 ALTHOUGH THEY ARE REALLY NOT FOR THE BODIES ARE ASSUMED MERELY FOR THIS PURPOSE THAT THE SPIRITUAL PROPERTIES AND WORKS OF THE ANGELS MAY BE MANIFESTED BY THE PROPERTIES OF MAN AND OF HIS WORKS
3009-10328-0028 THIS COULD NOT SO FITTINGLY BE DONE IF THEY WERE TO ASSUME TRUE MEN BECAUSE THE PROPERTIES OF SUCH MEN WOULD LEAD US TO MEN AND NOT TO ANGELS
3009-10328-0029 SENSATION IS ENTIRELY A VITAL FUNCTION CONSEQUENTLY IT CAN IN NO WAY BE SAID THAT THE ANGELS PERCEIVE THROUGH THE ORGANS OF THEIR ASSUMED BODIES YET SUCH BODIES ARE NOT FASHIONED IN VAIN
3009-10328-0030 FOR THEY ARE NOT FASHIONED FOR THE PURPOSE OF SENSATION THROUGH THEM BUT TO THIS END THAT BY SUCH BODILY ORGANS THE SPIRITUAL POWERS OF THE ANGELS MAY BE MADE MANIFEST JUST AS BY THE EYE THE POWER OF THE ANGEL'S KNOWLEDGE IS POINTED OUT
3009-10328-0031 AND OTHER POWERS BY THE OTHER MEMBERS
3009-10328-0032 MOVEMENT COMING FROM A UNITED MOVER IS A PROPER FUNCTION OF LIFE BUT THE BODIES ASSUMED BY THE ANGELS ARE NOT THUS MOVED SINCE THE ANGELS ARE NOT THEIR FORMS YET THE ANGELS ARE MOVED ACCIDENTALLY WHEN SUCH BODIES ARE MOVED
3009-10328-0033 SINCE THEY ARE IN THEM AS MOVERS ARE IN THE MOVED AND THEY ARE HERE IN SUCH A WAY
3009-10328-0034 BUT RESOLVED INTO PRE EXISTING MATTER NEVERTHELESS CHRIST HAD A BODY OF SUCH A TRUE NATURE THAT FOOD COULD BE CHANGED INTO IT
3009-10328-0035 BUT THE FOOD TAKEN BY ANGELS WAS NEITHER CHANGED INTO THE ASSUMED BODY NOR WAS THE BODY OF SUCH A NATURE THAT FOOD COULD BE CHANGED INTO IT CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS NOT A TRUE EATING BUT FIGURATIVE OF SPIRITUAL EATING
3009-10328-0036 THIS IS WHAT THE ANGEL SAID TO TOBIAS WHEN I WAS WITH YOU I SEEMED INDEED TO EAT AND TO DRINK BUT I USE
3009-10328-0037 IN WHOM NEVERTHELESS HE WORSHIPPED GOD
