1160-139717-0000 EARLY FRIENDS IN PHILADELPHIA KEIMER AND I LIV'D ON A PRETTY GOOD FAMILIAR FOOTING AND AGREED TOLERABLY WELL FOR HE SUSPECTED NOTHING OF MY SETTING UP
1160-139717-0001 HE RETAINED A GREAT DEAL OF HIS OLD ENTHUSIASMS AND LOV'D ARGUMENTATION WE THEREFORE HAD MANY DISPUTATIONS I USED TO WORK HIM SO WITH MY SOCRATIC METHOD
1160-139717-0002 SO DISTANT FROM ANY POINT WE HAD IN HAND AND YET BY DEGREES LED TO THE POINT AND BROUGHT HIM INTO DIFFICULTIES AND CONTRADICTIONS THAT AT LAST HE GREW RIDICULOUSLY CAUTIOUS
1160-139717-0003 THE MOST COMMON QUESTION WITHOUT ASKING FIRST
1160-139717-0004 HOWEVER IT GAVE HIM SO HIGH AN OPINION OF MY ABILITIES IN THE CONFUTING WAY THAT HE SERIOUSLY PROPOSED MY BEING HIS COLLEAGUE IN A PROJECT HE HAD OF SETTING UP A NEW SECT HE WAS TO PREACH THE DOCTRINES AND I WAS TO CONFOUND ALL OPPONENTS
1160-139717-0005 WHEN HE CAME TO EXPLAIN WITH ME UPON THE DOCTRINES I FOUND SEVERAL CONUNDRUMS WHICH I OBJECTED TO UNLESS I MIGHT HAVE MY WAY A LITTLE TOO AND INTRODUCE SOME OF MINE KEIMER WORE HIS BEARD AT FULL LENGTH BECAUSE
1160-139717-0006 BUT AGREED TO ADMIT THEM UPON CONDITION OF HIS ADOPTING THE DOCTRINE OF USING NO ANIMAL FOOD I DOUBT SAID HE MY CONSTITUTION WILL NOT BEAR THAT I ASSUR'D HIM IT WOULD
1160-139717-0007 HE WAS USUALLY A GREAT GLUTTON AND I PROMISED MYSELF SOME DIVERSION IN HALF STARVING HIM HE AGREED TO TRY THE PRACTICE IF I WOULD KEEP HIM COMPANY I DID SO AND WE HELD IT FOR THREE MONTHS
1160-139717-0008 WE HAD OUR VICTUALS DRESS'D AND BROUGHT TO US REGULARLY BY A WOMAN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHO HAD FROM ME A LIST OF FORTY DISHES TO BE PREPAR'D FOR US AT DIFFERENT TIMES
1160-139717-0009 I HAVE SINCE KEPT SEVERAL LENTS MOST STRICTLY LEAVING THE COMMON DIET FOR THAT AND THAT FOR THE COMMON ABRUPTLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INCONVENIENCE
1160-139717-0010 SUFFERED GRIEVOUSLY TIRED OF THE PROJECT LONG'D FOR THE FLESH POTS OF EGYPT AND ORDER'D A ROAST PIG HE INVITED ME AND TWO WOMEN FRIENDS TO DINE WITH HIM BUT IT BEING BROUGHT TOO SOON UPON TABLE
1160-139717-0011 HE COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION AND ATE THE WHOLE BEFORE WE CAME
1160-139717-0012 DURING THIS TIME TO MISS READ I HAD A GREAT RESPECT AND AFFECTION FOR HER AND HAD SOME REASON TO BELIEVE SHE HAD THE SAME FOR ME BUT AS I WAS ABOUT TO TAKE A LONG VOYAGE AND WE WERE BOTH VERY YOUNG ONLY A LITTLE ABOVE EIGHTEEN
1160-139717-0013 IT WAS THOUGHT MOST PRUDENT BY HER MOTHER TO PREVENT OUR GOING TOO FAR AT PRESENT AS A MARRIAGE IF IT WAS TO TAKE PLACE WOULD BE MORE CONVENIENT AFTER MY RETURN WHEN I SHOULD BE AS I EXPECTED SET UP IN MY BUSINESS
1160-139717-0014 PERHAPS TOO SHE THOUGHT MY EXPECTATIONS NOT SO WELL FOUNDED AS I IMAGINED THEM TO BE MY CHIEF ACQUAINTANCES AT THIS TIME WERE CHARLES OSBORNE JOSEPH WATSON AND JAMES RALPH ALL LOVERS OF READING
1160-139717-0015 CONVEYANCER IN THE TOWN CHARLES BROCKDEN THE OTHER WAS CLERK TO A MERCHANT WATSON WAS A PIOUS SENSIBLE YOUNG MAN OF GREAT INTEGRITY THE OTHERS RATHER MORE LAX IN THEIR PRINCIPLES OF RELIGION
1160-139717-0016 PARTICULARLY RALPH WHO AS WELL AS COLLINS HAD BEEN UNSETTLED BY ME FOR WHICH THEY BOTH MADE ME SUFFER OSBORNE WAS SENSIBLE CANDID FRANK SINCERE AND AFFECTIONATE TO HIS FRIENDS BUT IN LITERARY MATTERS
1160-139717-0017 TOO FOND OF CRITICIZING RALPH WAS INGENIOUS GENTEEL IN HIS MANNERS AND EXTREMELY ELOQUENT I THINK I NEVER KNEW A PRETTIER TALKER BOTH OF THEM WERE GREAT ADMIRERS OF POETRY
1160-139717-0018 ASSUR'D HIM HE HAD NO GENIUS FOR POETRY AND ADVIS'D HIM TO THINK OF NOTHING BEYOND THE BUSINESS HE WAS BRED TO THAT IN THE MERCANTILE WAY THO HE HAD NO STOCK HE MIGHT BY HIS DILIGENCE AND PUNCTUALITY
1160-139717-0019 RECOMMEND HIMSELF TO EMPLOYMENT AS A FACTOR AND IN TIME ACQUIRE WHEREWITH TO TRADE ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT I APPROV'D THE AMUSING ONE'S SELF WITH POETRY NOW AND THEN SO FAR AS TO IMPROVE ONE'S LANGUAGE BUT NO FARTHER
1160-139717-0020 WE EXCLUDED ALL CONSIDERATIONS OF INVENTION BY AGREEING THAT THE TASK SHOULD BE A VERSION OF THE EIGHTEENTH PSALM WHICH DESCRIBES THE DESCENT OF A DEITY WHEN THE TIME OF OUR MEETING DREW NIGH RALPH CALLED ON ME FIRST
1160-139717-0021 AND LET ME KNOW HIS PIECE WAS READY I TOLD HIM I HAD BEEN BUSY AND HAVING LITTLE INCLINATION HAD DONE NOTHING HE THEN SHOW'D ME HIS PIECE FOR MY OPINION AND I MUCH APPROV'D IT AS IT APPEAR'D TO ME TO HAVE GREAT MERIT
1160-139717-0022 NOW SAYS HE OSBORNE NEVER WILL ALLOW THE LEAST MERIT IN ANYTHING OF MINE BUT MAKES ONE THOUSAND CRITICISMS OUT OF MERE ENVY HE IS NOT SO JEALOUS OF YOU I WISH THEREFORE YOU WOULD TAKE THIS PIECE AND PRODUCE IT AS YOURS
1160-139717-0023 I WILL PRETEND NOT TO HAVE HAD TIME AND SO PRODUCE NOTHING WE SHALL THEN SEE WHAT HE WILL SAY TO IT IT WAS AGREED AND I IMMEDIATELY TRANSCRIB'D IT
1160-139717-0024 WE MET WATSON'S PERFORMANCE WAS READ THERE WERE SOME BEAUTIES IN IT BUT MANY DEFECTS OSBORNE'S WAS READ IT WAS MUCH BETTER RALPH DID IT JUSTICE REMARKED SOME FAULTS BUT APPLAUDED THE BEAUTIES
1160-139717-0025 HE HIMSELF HAD NOTHING TO PRODUCE I WAS BACKWARD SEEMED DESIROUS OF BEING EXCUSED
1160-139717-0026 BUT NO EXCUSE COULD BE ADMITTED PRODUCE I MUST
1160-139717-0027 AND JOIN'D IN APPLAUDING IT RALPH ONLY MADE SOME CRITICISMS AND PROPOS'D SOME AMENDMENTS BUT I DEFENDED MY TEXT OSBORNE WAS AGAINST RALPH AND TOLD HIM HE WAS NO BETTER A CRITIC THAN POET SO HE DROPT THE ARGUMENT
1160-139717-0028 BUT WHO WOULD HAVE IMAGIN'D SAID HE THAT FRANKLIN HAD BEEN CAPABLE OF SUCH A PERFORMANCE SUCH PAINTING SUCH FORCE SUCH FIRE HE HAS EVEN IMPROV'D THE ORIGINAL
1160-139717-0029 IN HIS COMMON CONVERSATION HE SEEMS TO HAVE NO CHOICE OF WORDS HE HESITATES AND BLUNDERS AND YET GOOD GOD HOW HE WRITES
1160-139717-0030 AND OSBORNE WAS A LITTLE LAUGHED AT THIS TRANSACTION FIXED RALPH IN HIS RESOLUTION OF BECOMING A POET I DID ALL I COULD TO DISSUADE HIM FROM IT BUT HE CONTINUED SCRIBBLING VERSES TILL POPE CURED HIM
