1085-169444-0000 INSTANTLY BROUGHT THE GREAT STEVINUS INTO MY HEAD WHO YOU MUST KNOW IS A FAVOURITE AUTHOR WITH ME THEN ADDED MY FATHER MAKING USE OF THE ARGUMENT AD CRUMENAM I WILL LAY TWENTY GUINEAS TO A SINGLE CROWN PIECE
1085-169444-0001 WHICH WILL SERVE TO GIVE AWAY TO OBADIAH WHEN HE GETS BACK THAT THIS SAME STEVINUS WAS SOME ENGINEER OR OTHER OR HAS WROTE SOMETHING OR OTHER EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY UPON THE SCIENCE OF FORTIFICATION
1085-169444-0002 HE HAS SO REPLIED MY UNCLE TOBY I KNEW IT SAID MY FATHER THOUGH FOR THE SOUL OF ME I CANNOT SEE WHAT KIND OF CONNECTION THERE CAN BE BETWIXT DOCTOR SLOP'S SUDDEN COMING AND A DISCOURSE UPON FORTIFICATION YET I FEAR'D IT
1085-169444-0003 TALK OF WHAT WE WILL BROTHER OR LET THE OCCASION BE NEVER SO FOREIGN OR UNFIT FOR THE SUBJECT YOU ARE SURE TO BRING IT IN I WOULD NOT BROTHER TOBY CONTINUED MY FATHER
1085-169444-0004 INTERRUPTING HIM AND LAUGHING MOST IMMODERATELY AT HIS PUN
1085-169444-0005 OR THE INSINUATION OF A PUN MORE CORDIALLY THAN MY FATHER HE WOULD GROW TESTY UPON IT AT ANY TIME BUT TO BE BROKE IN UPON BY ONE IN A SERIOUS DISCOURSE WAS AS BAD HE WOULD SAY AS A FILLIP UPON THE NOSE
1085-169444-0006 HE SAW NO DIFFERENCE SIR QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO DOCTOR SLOP THE CURTINS MY BROTHER SHANDY MENTIONS HERE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH BEADSTEADS
1085-169444-0007 THAT BED CURTAINS IN ALL PROBABILITY HAVE TAKEN THEIR NAME FROM THEM NOR HAVE THE HORN WORKS HE SPEAKS OF ANY THING IN THE WORLD TO DO WITH THE HORN WORKS OF CUCKOLDOM BUT THE CURTIN SIR IS THE WORD WE USE IN FORTIFICATION
1085-169444-0008 FOR THAT PART OF THE WALL OR RAMPART WHICH LIES BETWEEN THE TWO BASTIONS AND JOINS THEM BESIEGERS SELDOM OFFER TO CARRY ON THEIR ATTACKS DIRECTLY AGAINST THE CURTIN FOR THIS REASON BECAUSE THEY ARE SO WELL FLANKED
1085-169444-0009 TIS THE CASE OF OTHER CURTAINS QUOTH DOCTOR SLOP LAUGHING HOWEVER CONTINUED MY UNCLE TOBY TO MAKE THEM SURE WE GENERALLY CHOOSE TO PLACE RAVELINS BEFORE THEM
1085-169444-0010 THE COMMON MEN WHO KNOW VERY LITTLE OF FORTIFICATION CONFOUND THE RAVELIN AND THE HALF MOON TOGETHER THO THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT THINGS NOT IN THEIR FIGURE OR CONSTRUCTION FOR WE MAKE THEM EXACTLY ALIKE IN ALL POINTS
1085-169444-0011 FOR THEY ALWAYS CONSIST OF TWO FACES MAKING A SALIENT ANGLE WITH THE GORGES NOT STRAIGHT BUT IN FORM OF A CRESCENT WHERE THEN LIES THE DIFFERENCE QUOTH MY FATHER A LITTLE TESTILY
1085-169444-0012 IN THEIR SITUATIONS ANSWERED MY UNCLE TOBY FOR WHEN A RAVELIN BROTHER STANDS BEFORE THE CURTIN IT IS A RAVELIN AND WHEN A RAVELIN STANDS BEFORE A BASTION THEN THE RAVELIN IS NOT A RAVELIN IT IS A HALF MOON
1085-169444-0013 A HALF MOON LIKEWISE IS A HALF MOON AND NO MORE SO LONG AS IT STANDS BEFORE ITS BASTION BUT WAS IT TO CHANGE PLACE AND GET BEFORE THE CURTIN
1085-169444-0014 A HALF MOON IN THAT CASE IS NOT A HALF MOON
1085-169444-0015 I THINK QUOTH MY FATHER THAT THE NOBLE SCIENCE OF DEFENCE HAS ITS WEAK SIDES AS WELL AS OTHERS AS FOR THE HORN WORK HIGH HO SIGH'D MY FATHER WHICH CONTINUED MY UNCLE TOBY MY BROTHER WAS SPEAKING OF
1085-169444-0016 THEY ARE A VERY CONSIDERABLE PART OF AN OUTWORK THEY ARE CALLED BY THE FRENCH ENGINEERS OUVRAGE A CORNE AND WE GENERALLY MAKE THEM TO COVER SUCH PLACES AS WE SUSPECT TO BE WEAKER THAN THE REST
1085-169444-0017 I OWN CONTINUED MY UNCLE TOBY WHEN WE CROWN THEM THEY ARE MUCH STRONGER BUT THEN THEY ARE VERY EXPENSIVE AND TAKE UP A GREAT DEAL OF GROUND SO THAT IN MY OPINION THEY ARE MOST OF USE TO COVER OR DEFEND THE HEAD OF A CAMP
1085-169444-0018 BY THE MOTHER WHO BORE US BROTHER TOBY QUOTH MY FATHER
1085-169444-0019 YOU WOULD PROVOKE A SAINT HERE HAVE YOU GOT US I KNOW NOT HOW
1085-169444-0020 BUT SO FULL IS YOUR HEAD OF THESE CONFOUNDED WORKS THAT THOUGH MY WIFE IS THIS MOMENT IN THE PAINS OF LABOUR AND YOU HEAR HER CRY OUT YET NOTHING WILL SERVE YOU BUT TO CARRY OFF THE MAN MIDWIFE
1085-169444-0021 ACCOUCHEUR IF YOU PLEASE QUOTH DOCTOR SLOP WITH ALL MY HEART REPLIED MY FATHER I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY CALL YOU BUT I WISH THE WHOLE SCIENCE OF FORTIFICATION WITH ALL ITS INVENTORS AT THE DEVIL IT HAS BEEN THE DEATH OF THOUSANDS
1085-169444-0022 AND IT WILL BE MINE IN THE END I WOULD NOT I WOULD NOT BROTHER TOBY HAVE MY BRAINS SO FULL OF SAPS MINES BLINDS GABIONS PALLISADOES RAVELINS HALF MOONS AND SUCH TRUMPERY
1085-169444-0023 MY UNCLE TOBY WAS A MAN PATIENT OF INJURIES NOT FROM WANT OF COURAGE I HAVE TOLD YOU IN A FORMER CHAPTER THAT HE WAS A MAN OF COURAGE AND WILL ADD HERE THAT WHERE JUST OCCASIONS PRESENTED OR CALLED IT FORTH
1085-169444-0024 I KNOW NO MAN UNDER WHOSE ARM I WOULD HAVE SOONER TAKEN SHELTER NOR DID THIS ARISE FROM ANY INSENSIBILITY OR OBTUSENESS OF HIS INTELLECTUAL PARTS FOR HE FELT THIS INSULT OF MY FATHER'S AS FEELINGLY AS A MAN COULD DO
1085-169444-0025 BUT HE WAS OF A PEACEFUL PLACID NATURE NO JARRING ELEMENT IN IT ALL WAS MIXED UP SO KINDLY WITHIN HIM MY UNCLE TOBY HAD SCARCE A HEART TO RETALIATE UPON A FLY GO SAYS HE ONE DAY AT DINNER
1085-169444-0026 TO AN OVER GROWN ONE WHICH HAD BUZZED ABOUT HIS NOSE AND TORMENTED HIM CRUELLY ALL DINNER TIME AND WHICH AFTER INFINITE ATTEMPTS HE HAD CAUGHT AT LAST AS IT FLEW BY HIM I'LL NOT HURT THEE SAYS MY UNCLE TOBY RISING FROM HIS CHAIR
1085-169444-0027 AND GOING ACROSS THE ROOM WITH THE FLY IN HIS HAND I'LL NOT HURT A HAIR OF THY HEAD GO SAYS HE LIFTING UP THE SASH AND OPENING HIS HAND AS HE SPOKE TO LET IT ESCAPE GO POOR DEVIL GET THEE GONE WHY SHOULD I HURT THEE
1085-169444-0028 THIS WORLD SURELY IS WIDE ENOUGH TO HOLD BOTH THEE AND ME I WAS BUT TEN YEARS OLD WHEN THIS HAPPENED BUT WHETHER IT WAS THAT THE ACTION ITSELF WAS MORE IN UNISON TO MY NERVES AT THAT AGE OF PITY
1085-169444-0029 WHICH INSTANTLY SET MY WHOLE FRAME INTO ONE VIBRATION OF MOST PLEASURABLE SENSATION OR HOW FAR THE MANNER AND EXPRESSION OF IT MIGHT GO TOWARDS IT OR IN WHAT DEGREE OR BY WHAT SECRET MAGICK A TONE OF VOICE AND HARMONY OF MOVEMENT
1085-169444-0030 ATTUNED BY MERCY MIGHT FIND A PASSAGE TO MY HEART I KNOW NOT THIS I KNOW THAT THE LESSON OF UNIVERSAL GOOD WILL THEN TAUGHT AND IMPRINTED BY MY UNCLE TOBY HAS NEVER SINCE BEEN WORN OUT OF MY MIND
1085-169444-0031 HAVE DONE FOR ME IN THAT RESPECT OR DISCREDIT THE OTHER HELPS OF AN EXPENSIVE EDUCATION BESTOWED UPON ME BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD SINCE YET I OFTEN THINK THAT I OWE ONE HALF OF MY PHILANTHROPY TO THAT ONE ACCIDENTAL IMPRESSION
1085-169444-0032 THIS IS TO SERVE FOR PARENTS AND GOVERNORS INSTEAD OF A WHOLE VOLUME UPON THE SUBJECT I COULD NOT GIVE THE READER THIS STROKE IN MY UNCLE TOBY'S PICTURE BY THE INSTRUMENT WITH WHICH I DREW THE OTHER PARTS OF IT
1085-169444-0033 THAT TAKING IN NO MORE THAN THE MERE HOBBY HORSICAL LIKENESS THIS IS A PART OF HIS MORAL CHARACTER MY FATHER IN THIS PATIENT ENDURANCE OF WRONGS WHICH I MENTION WAS VERY DIFFERENT AS THE READER MUST LONG AGO HAVE NOTED
1085-169444-0034 HE HAD A MUCH MORE ACUTE AND QUICK SENSIBILITY OF NATURE ATTENDED WITH A LITTLE SORENESS OF TEMPER THO THIS NEVER TRANSPORTED HIM TO ANY THING WHICH LOOKED LIKE MALIGNANCY
1085-169444-0035 YET IN THE LITTLE RUBS AND VEXATIONS OF LIFE TWAS APT TO SHEW ITSELF IN A DROLLISH AND WITTY KIND OF PEEVISHNESS HE WAS HOWEVER FRANK AND GENEROUS IN HIS NATURE AT ALL TIMES OPEN TO CONVICTION
1085-169444-0036 AND IN THE LITTLE EBULLITIONS OF THIS SUBACID HUMOUR TOWARDS OTHERS BUT PARTICULARLY TOWARDS MY UNCLE TOBY WHOM HE TRULY LOVED HE WOULD FEEL MORE PAIN TEN TIMES TOLD
1085-169444-0037 EXCEPT IN THE AFFAIR OF MY AUNT DINAH OR WHERE AN HYPOTHESIS WAS CONCERNED THAN WHAT HE EVER GAVE THE CHARACTERS OF THE TWO BROTHERS IN THIS VIEW OF THEM
1085-169444-0038 REFLECTED LIGHT UPON EACH OTHER AND APPEARED WITH GREAT ADVANTAGE IN THIS AFFAIR WHICH AROSE ABOUT STEVINUS I NEED NOT TELL THE READER IF HE KEEPS A HOBBY HORSE THAT A MAN'S HOBBY HORSE IS AS TENDER A PART AS HE HAS ABOUT HIM
1085-169444-0039 AND THAT THESE UNPROVOKED STROKES AT MY UNCLE TOBY'S COULD NOT BE UNFELT BY HIM NO AS I SAID ABOVE MY UNCLE TOBY DID FEEL THEM AND VERY SENSIBLY TOO
1085-169444-0040 PRAY SIR WHAT SAID HE HOW DID HE BEHAVE O SIR IT WAS GREAT FOR AS SOON AS MY FATHER HAD DONE INSULTING HIS HOBBY HORSE HE TURNED HIS HEAD WITHOUT THE LEAST EMOTION FROM DOCTOR SLOP TO WHOM HE WAS ADDRESSING HIS DISCOURSE
1085-169444-0041 AND LOOKING UP INTO MY FATHER'S FACE WITH A COUNTENANCE SPREAD OVER WITH SO MUCH GOOD NATURE SO PLACID SO FRATERNAL SO INEXPRESSIBLY TENDER TOWARDS HIM IT PENETRATED MY FATHER TO HIS HEART
1085-169444-0042 HE ROSE UP HASTILY FROM HIS CHAIR AND SEIZING HOLD OF BOTH MY UNCLE TOBY'S HANDS AS HE SPOKE BROTHER TOBY SAID HE I BEG THY PARDON FORGIVE I PRAY THEE THIS RASH HUMOUR WHICH MY MOTHER GAVE ME
1085-169444-0043 RISING UP BY MY FATHER'S HELP SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT YOU ARE HEARTILY WELCOME HAD IT BEEN TEN TIMES AS MUCH BROTHER
1085-169444-0044 BY HEAVEN TIS COWARDLY YOU ARE HEARTILY WELCOME BROTHER QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY HAD IT BEEN FIFTY TIMES AS MUCH BESIDES WHAT HAVE I TO DO MY DEAR TOBY CRIED MY FATHER EITHER WITH YOUR AMUSEMENTS OR YOUR PLEASURES
1085-169444-0045 UNLESS IT WAS IN MY POWER WHICH IT IS NOT TO INCREASE THEIR MEASURE BROTHER SHANDY ANSWERED MY UNCLE TOBY LOOKING WISTFULLY IN HIS FACE YOU ARE MUCH MISTAKEN IN THIS POINT
