4356-6498-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN A VISIT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES THAT SAME AFTERNOON BALDOS BLISSFULLY IGNORANT OF THE STIR HE HAD CREATED IN CERTAIN CIRCLES
4356-6498-0001 RODE OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME AS A MEMBER OF THE CASTLE GUARD HE AND HADDAN WERE DETAILED BY COLONEL QUINNOX TO ACT AS PRIVATE ESCORT TO MISS CALHOUN UNTIL OTHERWISE ORDERED
4356-6498-0002 IF HADDAN THOUGHT HIMSELF WISER THAN BALDOS IN KNOWING THAT THEIR CHARGE WAS NOT THE PRINCESS HE WAS VERY MUCH MISTAKEN IF HE ENJOYED THE TRICK THAT WAS BEING PLAYED ON HIS FELLOW GUARDSMAN
4356-6498-0003 HIS ENJOYMENT WAS AS NOTHING AS COMPARED TO THE PLEASURE BALDOS WAS DERIVING FROM THE SITUATION THE ROYAL VICTORIA WAS DRIVEN TO THE FORTRESS CONVEYING THE SUPPOSED PRINCESS AND THE COUNTESS DAGMAR TO THE HOME OF COUNT MARLANX
4356-6498-0004 THE TWO GUARDS RODE BRAVELY BEHIND THE EQUIPAGE RESPLENDENT IN BRILLIANT NEW UNIFORMS BALDOS WAS MILDLY SURPRISED AND PUZZLED BY THE HOMAGE PAID THE YOUNG AMERICAN GIRL
4356-6498-0005 IT STRUCK HIM AS PREPOSTEROUS THAT THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF EDELWEISS COULD BE IN THE GAME TO DECEIVE HIM WHO IS THE PRINCESS'S COMPANION HE INQUIRED OF HADDAN AS THEY LEFT THE CASTLE GROUNDS
4356-6498-0006 BALDOS YOU BEHAVED VERY NICELY YESTERDAY IN EXPOSING THE DUPLICITY OF THOSE YOUNG WOMEN SHE SAID I AM HAPPY TO HAVE PLEASED YOUR HIGHNESS HE SAID STEADILY
4356-6498-0007 IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW THAT THEY CEASED TO BE LADIES IN WAITING AFTER THAT EXPOSURE YES YOUR HIGHNESS IT CERTAINLY IS INTERESTING HE SAID AS HE FELL BACK INTO POSITION BESIDE HADDAN
4356-6498-0008 DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE RIDE HE CAUGHT HIMSELF TIME AFTER TIME GAZING REFLECTIVELY AT THE BACK OF HER PROUD LITTLE HEAD POSSESSED OF AN ALMOST UNCONTROLLABLE DESIRE TO TOUCH THE SOFT BROWN HAIR
4356-6498-0009 YOU CAN'T FOOL THAT EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN MUCH LONGER MY DEAR SAID THE COUNTESS RECALLING THE LOOK IN HIS DARK EYES THE SAME THOUGHT HAD BEEN AFFLICTING BEVERLY WITH ITS PROBABILITIES FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND MORE
4356-6498-0010 COUNT MARLANX WELCOMED HIS VISITORS WITH A GRACIOUSNESS THAT AWOKE WONDER IN THE MINDS OF HIS STAFF HIS MARKED PREFERENCE FOR THE AMERICAN GIRL DID NOT ESCAPE ATTENTION
4356-6498-0011 SOME OF THE BOLDER YOUNG OFFICERS INDULGED IN SURREPTITIOUS GRIMACES AND ALL LOOKED WITH MORE OR LESS COMPASSION UPON THE HAPPY FACED BEAUTY FROM OVER THE SEA MARLANX SURVEYED BALDOS STEADILY AND COLDLY
4356-6498-0012 DEEP DISAPPROVAL IN HIS SINISTER EYES HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THE ENCOUNTER OF THE DAY BEFORE I SEE THE FAVORITE IS ON GUARD HE SAID BLANDLY HAS HE TOLD YOU OF THE LESSON IN MANNERS HE ENJOYED LAST NIGHT
4356-6498-0013 HE WAS LEADING HIS GUESTS TOWARD THE QUARTERS BALDOS AND HADDAN FOLLOWING THE NEW GUARD COULD NOT HELP HEARING THE SARCASTIC REMARK YOU DIDN'T HAVE HIM BEATEN CRIED BEVERLY STOPPING SHORT NO
4356-6498-0014 BALDOS HALTED NEAR BY HIS FACE WAS AS IMPASSIVE AS MARBLE HIS EYES SET STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM HIS FIGURE ERECT AND SOLDIERLY AN OCCASIONAL SARCASTIC REMARK BY THE IRON COUNT
4356-6498-0015 MEANT FOR HIS EARS MADE NO IMPRESSION UPON THE DEADLY COMPOSURE OF THE NEW GUARD WHO HAD HAD HIS LESSON MISS CALHOUN WAS CONSCIOUS OF A VAGUE FEELING THAT SHE HAD SERVED BALDOS AN ILL TURN WHEN SHE PUT HIM INTO THIS POSITION
4356-6498-0016 THE COUNT PROVIDED A LIGHT LUNCHEON IN HIS QUARTERS AFTER THE LADIES HAD GONE OVER THE FORTRESS BEVERLY CALHOUN WITH ALL OF A WOMAN'S INDIFFERENCE TO THINGS MATERIAL COULD NOT BUT SEE HOW POORLY EQUIPPED THE FORT WAS
4356-6498-0017 AS COMPARED TO THE ONES SHE HAD SEEN IN THE UNITED STATES SHE AND THE COUNTESS VISITED THE ARMORY THE ARSENAL AND THE REPAIR SHOPS BEFORE LUNCHEON RESERVING THE PLEASURES OF THE CLUBHOUSE THE OFFICERS QUARTERS
4356-6498-0018 AND THE PARADE GROUND UNTIL AFTERWARDS COUNT MARLANX'S HOME WAS IN THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE ENCLOSURE NEAR THE GATES SEVERAL OF THE OFFICERS LUNCHED WITH HIM AND THE YOUNG LADIES MARLANX WAS ASSIDUOUS IN HIS ATTENTION TO BEVERLY CALHOUN
4356-6498-0019 SO MUCH SO IN FACT THAT THE COUNTESS TEASED HER AFTERWARDS ABOUT HER CONQUEST OF THE OLD AND WELL WORN HEART BEVERLY THOUGHT HIM EXTREMELY SILLY AND SENTIMENTAL MUCH PREFERRING HIM IN THE CHARACTER OF THE HARSH IMPLACABLE MARTINET
4356-6498-0020 AT REGULAR INTERVALS SHE SAW THE STRAIGHT MARTIAL FORM OF BALDOS PASS THE WINDOW NEAR WHICH SHE SAT HE WAS PATROLLING THE NARROW PIAZZA WHICH FRONTED THE HOUSE TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THE RATHER TRYING LUNCHEON
4356-6498-0021 SHE WAS ALMOST UNABLE TO CONTROL THE IMPULSE TO RUSH OUT AND COMPEL HIM TO RELAX THAT IMPOSING MACHINE LIKE STRIDE SHE HUNGERED FOR A FEW MINUTES OF THE OLD TIME FREEDOM WITH HIM
4356-6498-0022 HE HAD COLLECTED IN THE SOUTH THE LUNCHEON WAS OVER AND THE COUNTESS HAD STROLLED OFF TOWARD THE BASTIONS WITH THE YOUNG OFFICERS
4356-6498-0023 LEAVING BEVERLY ALONE WITH THE HOST SERVANTS CAME IN TO CLEAR THE TABLES BUT THE COUNT HARSHLY ORDERED THEM TO WAIT UNTIL THE GUESTS HAD DEPARTED IT IS THE DEAREST THING I HAVE SEEN SAID BEVERLY HOLDING A RARE OLD CANDLESTICK AT ARM'S LENGTH
4356-6498-0024 THE COUNT'S EYES FOLLOWED THE GRACEFUL CURVES OF HER WHITE FOREARM WITH AN EAGERNESS THAT WAS ANNOYING I PRIZE IT MORE DEARLY THAN ANY OTHER PIECE IN MY COLLECTION HE SAID IT CAME FROM ROME
4356-6498-0025 IT HAS A HISTORY WHICH I SHALL TRY TO TELL YOU SOME DAY AND WHICH MAKES IT ALMOST INVALUABLE A GERMAN NOBLEMAN OFFERED ME A SMALL FORTUNE IF I WOULD PART WITH IT AND YOU WOULDN'T SELL IT
4356-6498-0026 I WAS SAVING IT FOR AN OCCASION YOUR HIGHNESS HE SAID HIS STEELY EYES GLITTERING THE GLAD HOUR HAS COME WHEN I CAN PART WITH IT FOR A RECOMPENSE FAR GREATER THAN THE BARON'S GOLD
4356-6498-0027 OH ISN'T IT LUCKY YOU KEPT IT SHE CRIED THEN SHE TURNED HER EYES AWAY QUICKLY FOR HIS GAZE SEEMED GREEDILY ENDEAVORING TO PIERCE THROUGH THE LACE INSERTION COVERING HER NECK AND SHOULDERS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW
4356-6498-0028 THE STEADY TRAMP OF THE TALL GUARD WENT ON MONOTONOUSLY THE RECOMPENSE OF A SWEET SMILE A TENDER BLUSH AND THE UNGUARDED THANKS OF A PRETTY WOMAN THE CANDLESTICK IS YOURS MISS CALHOUN
4356-6498-0029 IF YOU WILL REPAY ME FOR MY SACRIFICE BY ACCEPTING IT WITHOUT RESERVATION SLOWLY BEVERLY CALHOUN SET THE CANDLESTICK DOWN UPON THE TABLE HER EYES MEETING HIS WITH STEADY DISDAIN
4356-6498-0030 WE MUST HURRY ALONG YOU KNOW SHE AND I HAVE PROMISED TO PLAY TENNIS WITH THE PRINCESS AT THREE O'CLOCK THE COUNT'S GLARE OF DISAPPOINTMENT LASTED BUT A MOMENT THE DIPLOMACY OF EGOTISM CAME TO HIS RELIEF
4356-6498-0031 AND HE HELD BACK THE GIFT FOR ANOTHER DAY BUT NOT FOR ANOTHER WOMAN IT GRIEVES ME TO HAVE YOU HURRY AWAY MY AFTERNOON IS TO BE A DULL ONE UNLESS YOU PERMIT ME TO WATCH THE TENNIS GAME HE SAID
4356-6498-0032 HIS EYES FOR THE MOMENT HELD HER SPELLBOUND HE WAS DRAWING THE HAND TO HIS LIPS WHEN A SHADOW DARKENED THE FRENCH WINDOW AND A SABER RATTLED WARNINGLY COUNT MARLANX LOOKED UP INSTANTLY
4356-6498-0033 A SCOWL ON HIS FACE BALDOS STOOD AT THE WINDOW IN AN ATTITUDE OF ALERT ATTENTION BEVERLY DREW HER ARM AWAY SPASMODICALLY AND TOOK A STEP TOWARD THE WINDOW THE GUARD SAW BY HER EYES THAT SHE WAS FRIGHTENED
4356-6498-0034 BUT IF HIS HEART BEAT VIOLENTLY HIS FACE WAS THE PICTURE OF MILITARY STONINESS WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE SNARLED THE COUNT DID YOUR HIGHNESS CALL
4356-6498-0035 SHE DID NOT CALL FELLOW SAID THE COUNT WITH DEADLY MENACE IN HIS VOICE REPORT TO ME IN HALF AN HOUR YOU STILL HAVE SOMETHING TO LEARN I SEE BEVERLY WAS ALARMED BY THE THREAT IN HIS TONES
4356-6498-0036 SHE SAW WHAT WAS IN STORE FOR BALDOS FOR SHE KNEW QUITE AS WELL AS MARLANX THAT THE GUARD HAD DELIBERATELY INTERVENED IN HER BEHALF HE CANNOT COME IN HALF AN HOUR SHE CRIED QUICKLY
