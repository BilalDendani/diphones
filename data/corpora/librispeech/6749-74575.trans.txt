6749-74575-0000 THE PROOF BY EXPERIMENTS
6749-74575-0001 TERMINATED BY PARALLEL SIDES AND WITH A PERPENDICULAR RIGHT LINE DRAWN CROSS FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER DISTINGUISHED IT INTO TWO EQUAL PARTS ONE OF THESE PARTS I PAINTED WITH A RED COLOUR AND THE OTHER WITH A BLUE
6749-74575-0002 THROUGH WHICH THE LIGHT PASSED TO THE EYE WERE PLANE AND WELL POLISHED AND CONTAINED AN ANGLE OF ABOUT SIXTY DEGREES WHICH ANGLE I CALL THE REFRACTING ANGLE OF THE PRISM AND WHILST I VIEW'D IT
6749-74575-0003 MADE AN ANGLE WITH THE PAPER EQUAL TO THAT ANGLE WHICH WAS MADE WITH THE SAME PAPER BY THE LIGHT REFLECTED FROM IT TO THE EYE BEYOND THE PRISM WAS THE WALL OF THE CHAMBER UNDER THE WINDOW COVERED OVER WITH BLACK CLOTH
6749-74575-0004 AND THE CLOTH WAS INVOLVED IN DARKNESS THAT NO LIGHT MIGHT BE REFLECTED FROM THENCE WHICH IN PASSING BY THE EDGES OF THE PAPER TO THE EYE MIGHT MINGLE ITSELF WITH THE LIGHT OF THE PAPER AND OBSCURE THE PHAENOMENON THEREOF
6749-74575-0005 THESE THINGS BEING THUS ORDERED I FOUND THAT IF THE REFRACTING ANGLE OF THE PRISM BE TURNED UPWARDS SO THAT THE PAPER MAY SEEM TO BE LIFTED UPWARDS BY THE REFRACTION ITS BLUE HALF WILL BE LIFTED HIGHER BY THE REFRACTION
6749-74575-0006 THAN ITS RED HALF BUT IF THE REFRACTING ANGLE OF THE PRISM BE TURNED DOWNWARD SO THAT THE PAPER MAY SEEM TO BE CARRIED LOWER BY THE REFRACTION ITS BLUE HALF WILL BE CARRIED SOMETHING LOWER THEREBY THAN ITS RED HALF
6749-74575-0007 WHEREFORE IN BOTH CASES THE LIGHT WHICH COMES FROM THE BLUE HALF OF THE PAPER
6749-74575-0008 WHICH COMES FROM THE RED HALF AND BY CONSEQUENCE IS MORE REFRANGIBLE ILLUSTRATION IN THE ELEVENTH FIGURE
6749-74575-0009 THE PAPER TERMINATED WITH PARALLEL SIDES
6749-74575-0010 DISTINGUISHED INTO TWO HALFS THE ONE
6749-74575-0011 OF AN INTENSELY BLUE COLOUR THE OTHER
6749-74575-0012 REPRESENTS THE PRISM WHOSE REFRACTING PLANES
6749-74575-0013 MEET IN THE EDGE OF THE REFRACTING ANGLE A A
6749-74575-0014 BEING UPWARD IS PARALLEL BOTH TO THE HORIZON AND TO THE PARALLEL EDGES OF THE PAPER
6749-74575-0015 IS CARRIED HIGHER TO
6749-74575-0016 OF VERY BLACK SILK IN SUCH MANNER
6749-74575-0017 LIKE SO MANY BLACK LINES DRAWN OVER THEM OR LIKE LONG AND SLENDER DARK SHADOWS CAST UPON THEM I MIGHT HAVE DRAWN BLACK LINES WITH A PEN BUT THE THREDS WERE SMALLER AND BETTER DEFINED
6749-74575-0018 THIS PAPER THUS COLOURED AND LINED I SET AGAINST A WALL PERPENDICULARLY TO THE HORIZON SO THAT ONE OF THE COLOURS MIGHT STAND TO THE RIGHT HAND AND THE OTHER TO THE LEFT CLOSE BEFORE THE PAPER
6749-74575-0019 AT THE CONFINE OF THE COLOURS BELOW I PLACED A CANDLE TO ILLUMINATE THE PAPER STRONGLY FOR THE EXPERIMENT WAS TRIED IN THE NIGHT THE FLAME OF THE CANDLE REACHED UP TO THE LOWER EDGE OF THE PAPER OR A VERY LITTLE HIGHER
6749-74575-0020 THEN AT THE DISTANCE OF SIX FEET AND ONE OR TWO INCHES FROM THE PAPER UPON THE FLOOR I ERECTED A GLASS LENS FOUR INCHES AND A QUARTER BROAD WHICH MIGHT COLLECT THE RAYS COMING FROM THE SEVERAL POINTS OF THE PAPER AND MAKE THEM CONVERGE
6749-74575-0021 TOWARDS SO MANY OTHER POINTS AT THE SAME DISTANCE OF SIX FEET AND ONE OR TWO INCHES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LENS AND SO FORM THE IMAGE OF THE COLOURED PAPER UPON A WHITE PAPER PLACED THERE AFTER THE SAME MANNER
6749-74575-0022 THE AFORESAID WHITE PAPER ERECTED PERPENDICULAR TO THE HORIZON AND TO THE RAYS WHICH FELL UPON IT FROM THE LENS I MOVED SOMETIMES TOWARDS THE LENS SOMETIMES FROM IT TO FIND THE PLACES WHERE THE IMAGES OF THE BLUE
6749-74575-0023 THE PLACES WHERE THE IMAGES OF THE RED AND BLUE HALFS OF THE COLOURED PAPER APPEARED MOST DISTINCT I FOUND THAT WHERE THE RED HALF OF THE PAPER APPEARED DISTINCT THE BLUE HALF APPEARED CONFUSED SO THAT THE BLACK LINES DRAWN UPON IT
6749-74575-0024 COULD SCARCE BE SEEN AND ON THE CONTRARY WHERE THE BLUE HALF APPEARED MOST DISTINCT THE RED HALF APPEARED CONFUSED SO THAT THE BLACK LINES UPON IT WERE SCARCE VISIBLE AND BETWEEN THE TWO PLACES
6749-74575-0025 WHERE THESE IMAGES APPEARED DISTINCT THERE WAS THE DISTANCE OF AN INCH AND A HALF THE DISTANCE OF THE WHITE PAPER FROM THE LENS WHEN THE IMAGE OF THE RED HALF OF THE COLOURED PAPER APPEARED MOST DISTINCT BEING GREATER BY AN INCH AND AN HALF
6749-74575-0026 THAN THE DISTANCE OF THE SAME WHITE PAPER FROM THE LENS WHEN THE IMAGE OF THE BLUE HALF APPEARED MOST DISTINCT IN LIKE INCIDENCES THEREFORE OF THE BLUE AND RED UPON THE LENS THE BLUE WAS REFRACTED MORE BY THE LENS THAN THE RED
6749-74575-0027 THE SAME PAPER IN THAT PLACE WHERE THE BLUE HALF APPEARED DISTINCT THE PLACE
6749-74575-0028 BY AN INCH AND AN HALF
6749-74575-0029 BUT IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THESE EXPERIMENTS I HAVE SET DOWN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES BY WHICH EITHER THE PHAENOMENON MIGHT BE RENDER'D MORE CONSPICUOUS OR A NOVICE MIGHT MORE EASILY TRY THEM OR BY WHICH I DID TRY THEM ONLY
6749-74575-0030 THE SAME THING I HAVE OFTEN DONE IN THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS CONCERNING ALL WHICH THIS ONE ADMONITION MAY SUFFICE NOW FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS IT FOLLOWS NOT THAT ALL THE LIGHT OF THE BLUE IS MORE REFRANGIBLE
6749-74575-0031 FOR BOTH LIGHTS ARE MIXED OF RAYS DIFFERENTLY REFRANGIBLE SO THAT IN THE RED THERE ARE SOME RAYS NOT LESS REFRANGIBLE THAN THOSE OF THE BLUE AND IN THE BLUE THERE ARE SOME RAYS NOT MORE REFRANGIBLE THAN THOSE OF THE RED
6749-74575-0032 BUT THESE RAYS IN PROPORTION TO THE WHOLE LIGHT ARE BUT FEW AND SERVE TO DIMINISH THE EVENT OF THE EXPERIMENT BUT ARE NOT ABLE TO DESTROY IT FOR IF THE RED AND BLUE COLOURS WERE MORE DILUTE AND WEAK
