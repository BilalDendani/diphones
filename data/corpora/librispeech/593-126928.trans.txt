593-126928-0000 IF WE COULD RENOUNCE OUR SAGENESS AND DISCARD OUR WISDOM IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE PEOPLE A HUNDREDFOLD IF WE COULD RENOUNCE OUR BENEVOLENCE AND DISCARD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS THE PEOPLE WOULD AGAIN BECOME FILIAL AND KINDLY
593-126928-0001 IF WE COULD RENOUNCE OUR ARTFUL CONTRIVANCES AND DISCARD OUR SCHEMING FOR GAIN THERE WOULD BE NO THIEVES NOR ROBBERS
593-126928-0002 THOSE THREE METHODS OF GOVERNMENT THOUGHT OLDEN WAYS IN ELEGANCE DID FAIL AND MADE THESE NAMES THEIR WANT OF WORTH TO VEIL BUT SIMPLE VIEWS AND COURSES PLAIN AND TRUE
593-126928-0003 WHEN WE RENOUNCE LEARNING WE HAVE NO TROUBLES THE READY YES AND FLATTERING YEA SMALL IS THE DIFFERENCE THEY DISPLAY BUT MARK THEIR ISSUES GOOD AND ILL
593-126928-0004 WHAT SPACE THE GULF BETWEEN SHALL FILL WHAT ALL MEN FEAR IS INDEED TO BE FEARED BUT HOW WIDE AND WITHOUT END IS THE RANGE OF QUESTIONS ASKING TO BE DISCUSSED
593-126928-0005 THE MULTITUDE OF MEN LOOK SATISFIED AND PLEASED AS IF ENJOYING A FULL BANQUET AS IF MOUNTED ON A TOWER IN SPRING I ALONE SEEM LISTLESS AND STILL MY DESIRES HAVING AS YET GIVEN NO INDICATION OF THEIR PRESENCE
593-126928-0006 I AM LIKE AN INFANT WHICH HAS NOT YET SMILED
593-126928-0007 THE MULTITUDE OF MEN ALL HAVE ENOUGH AND TO SPARE I ALONE SEEM TO HAVE LOST EVERYTHING MY MIND IS THAT OF A STUPID MAN I AM IN A STATE OF CHAOS
593-126928-0008 ORDINARY MEN LOOK BRIGHT AND INTELLIGENT WHILE I ALONE SEEM TO BE BENIGHTED THEY LOOK FULL OF DISCRIMINATION WHILE I ALONE AM DULL AND CONFUSED I SEEM TO BE CARRIED ABOUT AS ON THE SEA
593-126928-0009 DRIFTING AS IF I HAD NOWHERE TO REST ALL MEN HAVE THEIR SPHERES OF ACTION WHILE I ALONE SEEM DULL AND INCAPABLE LIKE A RUDE BORDERER THUS I ALONE AM DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MEN
593-126928-0010 BUT I VALUE THE NURSING MOTHER THE TAO
593-126928-0011 THE GRANDEST FORMS OF ACTIVE FORCE FROM TAO COME THEIR ONLY SOURCE WHO CAN OF TAO THE NATURE TELL OUR SIGHT IT FLIES OUR TOUCH AS WELL
593-126928-0012 ELUDING SIGHT ELUDING TOUCH THE FORMS OF THINGS ALL IN IT CROUCH ELUDING TOUCH ELUDING SIGHT THERE ARE THEIR SEMBLANCES ALL RIGHT
593-126928-0013 PROFOUND IT IS DARK AND OBSCURE THINGS ESSENCES ALL THERE ENDURE THOSE ESSENCES THE TRUTH ENFOLD OF WHAT WHEN SEEN SHALL THEN BE TOLD NOW IT IS SO TWAS SO OF OLD
593-126928-0014 ITS NAME WHAT PASSES NOT AWAY SO IN THEIR BEAUTIFUL ARRAY THINGS FORM AND NEVER KNOW DECAY HOW KNOW I THAT IT IS SO WITH ALL THE BEAUTIES OF EXISTING THINGS BY THIS NATURE OF THE TAO
593-126928-0015 THE PARTIAL BECOMES COMPLETE THE CROOKED STRAIGHT THE EMPTY FULL THE WORN OUT NEW HE WHOSE DESIRES ARE FEW GETS THEM HE WHOSE DESIRES ARE MANY GOES ASTRAY
593-126928-0016 THEREFORE THE SAGE HOLDS IN HIS EMBRACE THE ONE THING OF HUMILITY AND MANIFESTS IT TO ALL THE WORLD HE IS FREE FROM SELF DISPLAY AND THEREFORE HE SHINES FROM SELF ASSERTION AND THEREFORE HE IS DISTINGUISHED
593-126928-0017 FROM SELF BOASTING AND THEREFORE HIS MERIT IS ACKNOWLEDGED FROM SELF COMPLACENCY AND THEREFORE HE ACQUIRES SUPERIORITY IT IS BECAUSE HE IS THUS FREE FROM STRIVING THAT THEREFORE NO ONE IN THE WORLD IS ABLE TO STRIVE WITH HIM
593-126928-0018 THAT SAYING OF THE ANCIENTS THAT THE PARTIAL BECOMES COMPLETE WAS NOT VAINLY SPOKEN ALL REAL COMPLETION IS COMPREHENDED UNDER IT
593-126928-0019 ABSTAINING FROM SPEECH MARKS HIM WHO IS OBEYING THE SPONTANEITY OF HIS NATURE A VIOLENT WIND DOES NOT LAST FOR A WHOLE MORNING A SUDDEN RAIN DOES NOT LAST FOR THE WHOLE DAY TO WHOM IS IT THAT THESE TWO THINGS ARE OWING
593-126928-0020 TO HEAVEN AND EARTH IF HEAVEN AND EARTH CANNOT MAKE SUCH SPASMODIC ACTINGS LAST LONG HOW MUCH LESS CAN MAN
593-126928-0021 THEREFORE WHEN ONE IS MAKING THE TAO HIS BUSINESS THOSE WHO ARE ALSO PURSUING IT AGREE WITH HIM IN IT AND THOSE WHO ARE MAKING THE MANIFESTATION OF ITS COURSE THEIR OBJECT AGREE WITH HIM IN THAT
593-126928-0022 WHILE EVEN THOSE WHO ARE FAILING IN BOTH THESE THINGS AGREE WITH HIM WHERE THEY FAIL
593-126928-0023 HENCE THOSE WITH WHOM HE AGREES AS TO THE TAO HAVE THE HAPPINESS OF ATTAINING TO IT THOSE WITH WHOM HE AGREES AS TO ITS MANIFESTATION HAVE THE HAPPINESS OF ATTAINING TO IT AND THOSE WITH WHOM HE AGREES IN THEIR FAILURE
593-126928-0024 HAVE ALSO THE HAPPINESS OF ATTAINING TO THE TAO BUT WHEN THERE IS NOT FAITH SUFFICIENT ON HIS PART A WANT OF FAITH IN HIM ENSUES ON THE PART OF THE OTHERS
593-126928-0025 HE WHO STANDS ON HIS TIPTOES DOES NOT STAND FIRM HE WHO STRETCHES HIS LEGS DOES NOT WALK EASILY SO HE WHO DISPLAYS HIMSELF DOES NOT SHINE HE WHO ASSERTS HIS OWN VIEWS IS NOT DISTINGUISHED
593-126928-0026 HE WHO VAUNTS HIMSELF DOES NOT FIND HIS MERIT ACKNOWLEDGED HE WHO IS SELF CONCEITED HAS NO SUPERIORITY ALLOWED TO HIM SUCH CONDITIONS VIEWED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE TAO
593-126928-0027 ARE LIKE REMNANTS OF FOOD OR A TUMOUR ON THE BODY WHICH ALL DISLIKE HENCE
593-126928-0028 THERE WAS SOMETHING UNDEFINED AND COMPLETE COMING INTO EXISTENCE BEFORE HEAVEN AND EARTH HOW STILL IT WAS AND FORMLESS STANDING ALONE AND UNDERGOING NO CHANGE REACHING EVERYWHERE AND IN NO DANGER OF BEING EXHAUSTED
593-126928-0029 IT MAY BE REGARDED AS THE MOTHER OF ALL THINGS
593-126928-0030 MAKING AN EFFORT FURTHER TO GIVE IT A NAME I CALL IT THE GREAT
593-126928-0031 GREAT IT PASSES ON IN CONSTANT FLOW PASSING ON IT BECOMES REMOTE HAVING BECOME REMOTE IT RETURNS
593-126928-0032 HEAVEN IS GREAT EARTH IS GREAT AND THE SAGE KING IS ALSO GREAT IN THE UNIVERSE THERE ARE FOUR THAT ARE GREAT AND THE SAGE KING IS ONE OF THEM
593-126928-0033 MAN TAKES HIS LAW FROM THE EARTH THE EARTH TAKES ITS LAW FROM HEAVEN HEAVEN TAKES ITS LAW FROM THE TAO THE LAW OF THE TAO IS ITS BEING WHAT IT IS
593-126928-0034 GRAVITY IS THE ROOT OF LIGHTNESS STILLNESS THE RULER OF MOVEMENT
593-126928-0035 THEREFORE A WISE PRINCE MARCHING THE WHOLE DAY DOES NOT GO FAR FROM HIS BAGGAGE WAGGONS ALTHOUGH HE MAY HAVE BRILLIANT PROSPECTS TO LOOK AT HE QUIETLY REMAINS IN HIS PROPER PLACE INDIFFERENT TO THEM
593-126928-0036 HOW SHOULD THE LORD OF A MYRIAD CHARIOTS CARRY HIMSELF LIGHTLY BEFORE THE KINGDOM IF HE DO ACT LIGHTLY HE HAS LOST HIS ROOT OF GRAVITY IF HE PROCEED TO ACTIVE MOVEMENT HE WILL LOSE HIS THRONE
593-126928-0037 THE SKILFUL TRAVELLER LEAVES NO TRACES OF HIS WHEELS OR FOOTSTEPS THE SKILFUL SPEAKER SAYS NOTHING THAT CAN BE FOUND FAULT WITH OR BLAMED THE SKILFUL RECKONER USES NO TALLIES
593-126928-0038 THE SKILFUL CLOSER NEEDS NO BOLTS OR BARS WHILE TO OPEN WHAT HE HAS SHUT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE THE SKILFUL BINDER USES NO STRINGS OR KNOTS WHILE TO UNLOOSE WHAT HE HAS BOUND WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE
593-126928-0039 IN THE SAME WAY THE SAGE IS ALWAYS SKILFUL AT SAVING MEN AND SO HE DOES NOT CAST AWAY ANY MAN HE IS ALWAYS SKILFUL AT SAVING THINGS AND SO HE DOES NOT CAST AWAY ANYTHING THIS IS CALLED HIDING THE LIGHT OF HIS PROCEDURE
593-126928-0040 THEREFORE THE MAN OF SKILL IS A MASTER TO BE LOOKED UP TO BY HIM WHO HAS NOT THE SKILL AND HE WHO HAS NOT THE SKILL IS THE HELPER OF THE REPUTATION OF HIM WHO HAS THE SKILL
593-126928-0041 IF THE ONE DID NOT HONOUR HIS MASTER AND THE OTHER DID NOT REJOICE IN HIS HELPER AN OBSERVER THOUGH INTELLIGENT MIGHT GREATLY ERR ABOUT THEM
