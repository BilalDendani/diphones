4246-12545-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN A BIT OF BAD LUCK OLD OREGON TRAIL MONUMENT EXPEDITION BRADY ISLAND NEBRASKA AUGUST NINTH NINETEEN O SIX
4246-12545-0001 YESTERDAY MORNING TWIST ATE HIS BREAKFAST AS USUAL AND SHOWED NO SIGNS OF SICKNESS UNTIL WE WERE ON THE ROAD TWO OR THREE MILES WHEN HE BEGAN TO PUT HIS TONGUE OUT AND HIS BREATHING BECAME HEAVY BUT HE LEANED ON THE YOKE MORE HEAVILY THAN USUAL AND DETERMINED TO PULL THE WHOLE LOAD
4246-12545-0002 I FINALLY STOPPED PUT HIM ON THE OFF SIDE GAVE HIM THE LONG END OF THE YOKE AND TIED HIS HEAD BACK WITH THE HALTER STRAP TO THE CHAIN BUT TO NO PURPOSE
4246-12545-0003 I FINALLY UNYOKED GAVE HIM A QUART OF LARD A GILL OF VINEGAR AND A HANDFUL OF SUGAR BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE
4246-12545-0004 SUCH IS THE RECORD IN MY JOURNAL OF THIS NOBLE ANIMAL'S DEATH I THINK HE DIED FROM EATING SOME POISONOUS PLANT WHEN WE STARTED
4246-12545-0005 HAD WALLOWED IN THE SNOWS OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS FOLLOWED THE TORTUOUS ROCKY CANYON OF BURNT RIVER AND GONE THROUGH THE DEEP SANDS OF THE SNAKE THIS OX HAD GAINED ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN POUNDS
4246-12545-0006 HE WOULD KEEP HIS END OF THE YOKE A LITTLE AHEAD
4246-12545-0007 THERE ARE PRONOUNCED INDIVIDUALITIES IN ANIMALS AS WELL AS IN MEN I MIGHT HAVE SAID VIRTUES TOO AND WHY NOT IF AN ANIMAL ALWAYS DOES HIS DUTY AND IS FAITHFUL AND INDUSTRIOUS WHY NOT RECOGNIZE THIS CHARACTER
4246-12545-0008 EVEN IF HE IS NOTHING BUT AN OX TO UNDERSTAND THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS OX IT IS NECESSARY TO KNOW THE BURDEN THAT HE CARRIED
4246-12545-0009 HAD WOODEN AXLES AND WIDE TRACK AND CARRIED AN AVERAGE LOAD OF EIGHT HUNDRED POUNDS ALONG WITH AN UNBROKEN FOUR YEAR OLD STEER A NATURAL BORN SHIRK
4246-12545-0010 AND HE WAS IN BETTER WORKING TRIM JUST BEFORE HE DIED THAN WHEN THE TRIP BEGAN AND YET AM I SURE THAT AT SOME POINTS I DID NOT ABUSE HIM WHAT ABOUT COMING UP OUT OF LITTLE CANYON OR RATHER UP THE STEEP ROCKY STEPS OF STONES LIKE STAIRS WHEN I USED THE GOAD
4246-12545-0011 AND HE PULLED A SHOE OFF HIS FEET WAS I MERCIFUL THEN OR DID I EXACT MORE THAN I OUGHT I CAN SEE HIM YET IN MY MIND ON HIS KNEES HOLDING THE WAGON FROM ROLLING INTO THE CANYON TILL THE WHEEL COULD BE BLOCKED AND THE BRAKES SET
4246-12545-0012 THEN WHEN BIDDEN TO START THE LOAD HE DID NOT FLINCH
4246-12545-0013 AGAIN I HIRED A HORSE TEAM TO HAUL THE WAGON TO LEXINGTON AT LEXINGTON I THOUGHT THE LOSS OF THE OX COULD BE REPAIRED BY BUYING A PAIR OF HEAVY COWS AND BREAKING THEM IN TO WORK SO I PURCHASED TWO OUT OF A BAND OF TWO HUNDRED CATTLE
4246-12545-0014 WHY YES OF COURSE THEY WILL WORK I SAID IN REPLY TO A BYSTANDER'S QUESTION
4246-12545-0015 WE WILL SOON HAVE A TEAM I DECLARED WITH ALL THE CONFIDENCE IN THE WORLD ONLY WE CAN'T GO VERY FAR IN A DAY WITH A RAW TEAM ESPECIALLY IN THIS HOT WEATHER BUT ONE COW WOULD NOT GO AT ALL WE COULD NEITHER LEAD HER NOR DRIVE HER
4246-12545-0016 PUT HER IN THE YOKE AND SHE WOULD STAND STOCK STILL JUST LIKE A STUBBORN MULE HITCH THE YOKE BY A STRONG ROPE BEHIND THE WAGON WITH A HORSE TEAM TO PULL AND SHE WOULD BRACE HER FEET AND ACTUALLY SLIDE ALONG BUT WOULD NOT LIFT A FOOT
4246-12545-0017 WON'T YOU TAKE HER BACK AND GIVE ME ANOTHER I ASKED THE SELLER YES I WILL GIVE YOU THAT RED COW ONE I HAD REJECTED AS UNFIT BUT NOT ONE OF THE OTHERS WHAT IS THIS COW WORTH TO YOU THIRTY DOLLARS
4246-12545-0018 SO I DROPPED TEN DOLLARS HAVING PAID FORTY FOR THE FIRST COW BESIDES I HAD LOST THE BETTER PART OF A DAY AND EXPERIENCED A GOOD DEAL OF VEXATION IF I COULD ONLY HAVE HAD TWIST BACK AGAIN THE FACT GRADUALLY BECAME APPARENT THAT THE LOSS OF THAT FINE OX WAS ALMOST IRREPARABLE
4246-12545-0019 I COULD NOT GET TRACK OF AN OX ANYWHERE NOR EVEN OF A STEER LARGE ENOUGH TO MATE THE DAVE OX BESIDES DAVE ALWAYS WAS A FOOL TWIST WOULD WATCH MY EVERY MOTION AND MIND BY THE WAVE OF THE HAND BUT DAVE NEVER MINDED ANYTHING EXCEPT TO SHIRK HARD WORK
4246-12545-0020 TWIST SEEMED TO LOVE HIS WORK AND WOULD GO FREELY ALL DAY IT WAS BROUGHT HOME TO ME MORE FORCIBLY THAN EVER THAT IN THE LOSS OF THE TWIST OX I HAD ALMOST LOST THE WHOLE TEAM WHEN I DROVE OUT FROM LEXINGTON BEHIND A HIRED HORSE TEAM THAT DAY
4246-12545-0021 IT MAY EASILY BE GUESSED THAT THE PRIDE OF ANTICIPATED SUCCESS DIED OUT AND DEEP DISCOURAGEMENT SEIZED UPON ME I HAD TWO YOKES ONE A HEAVY OX YOKE THE OTHER A LIGHT COW'S YOKE BUT THE COW I THOUGHT
4246-12545-0022 COULD NOT BE WORKED ALONGSIDE THE OX IN THE OX YOKE NOR THE OX WITH THE COW IN THE COW YOKE I WAS WITHOUT A TEAM BUT WITH A DOUBLE ENCUMBRANCE YES THE OX HAS PASSED FOR IN ALL NEBRASKA I WAS UNABLE TO FIND EVEN ONE YOKE
4246-12545-0023 I TRUDGED ALONG SOMETIMES BEHIND THE LED CATTLE WONDERING IN MY MIND WHETHER OR NOT I HAD BEEN FOOLISH TO UNDERTAKE THIS EXPEDITION TO PERPETUATE THE MEMORY OF THE OLD OREGON TRAIL HAD I NOT BEEN REBUFFED AT THE FIRST BY A NUMBER OF BUSINESS MEN
4246-12545-0024 WHO PUSHED THE SUBJECT ASIDE WITH I HAVE NO TIME TO LOOK INTO IT HADN'T I BEEN COMPELLED TO PASS SEVERAL TOWNS
4246-12545-0025 TO MARK THE TRAIL AND KEEP ALIVE THE MEMORY OF THE PIONEERS MOREOVER I RECALLED THE ENTHUSIASTIC RECEPTION IN SO MANY PLACES THE OUTPOURING OF CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THOUSANDS OF SCHOOL CHILDREN THE WILLING HANDS OF THE PEOPLE THAT BUILT THESE MONUMENTS
4246-12545-0026 AND THE MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ATTENDING THE DEDICATION CEREMONIES THESE HEARTENING RECOLLECTIONS MADE ME FORGET THE LOSS OF TWIST THE RECALCITRANT COW
4246-12545-0027 OR LEISURELY CROSSED OUR TRACK AND AT TIMES OBSTRUCTED OUR WAY AND HERDS OF ANTELOPE WATCHED FROM VANTAGE POINTS BUT NOW THE BUFFALO AND ANTELOPE HAVE DISAPPEARED THE INDIAN LIKEWISE IS GONE
4246-12545-0028 INSTEAD OF THE PARCHED PLAIN OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO WITH ITS FIERCE CLOUDS OF DUST ROLLING UP THE VALLEY AND ENGULFING WHOLE TRAINS WE SAW A LANDSCAPE OF SMILING FRUITFUL FIELDS INVITING GROVES OF TREES AND CONTENTED HOMES FROM GRAND ISLAND I WENT TO FREMONT NEBRASKA
4246-12545-0029 TO HEAD THE PROCESSION IN THE SEMI CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION IN HONOR OF THE FOUNDING OF THAT CITY IN THE PROCESSION I WORKED THE OX AND COW TOGETHER FROM FREMONT I WENT ON TO LINCOLN
4246-12545-0030 ALL THE WHILE I WAS SEARCHING FOR AN OX OR A STEER LARGE ENOUGH TO MATE THE DAVE OX BUT WITHOUT AVAIL FINALLY AFTER LOOKING OVER A THOUSAND HEAD OF CATTLE IN THE STOCKYARDS OF OMAHA I FOUND A FIVE YEAR OLD STEER DANDY WHICH I BROKE IN ON THE WAY TO INDIANAPOLIS
4246-12545-0031 THIS OX PROVED TO BE VERY SATISFACTORY HE NEVER KICKED OR HOOKED AND WAS ALWAYS IN GOOD HUMOR DAVE AND DANDY MADE GOOD TEAM MATES AS DUMB AS AN OX IS A VERY COMMON EXPRESSION DATING BACK AS FAR AS MY MEMORY GOES
4246-12545-0032 IN FACT THE OX IS NOT SO DUMB AS A CASUAL OBSERVER MIGHT THINK DAVE AND DANDY KNEW ME AS FAR AS THEY COULD SEE SOMETIMES WHEN I WENT TO THEM IN THE MORNING DAVE WOULD LIFT HIS HEAD BOW HIS NECK STRETCH OUT HIS BODY AND PERHAPS EXTEND A FOOT AS IF TO SAY
4246-12545-0033 GOOD MORNING TO YOU GLAD TO SEE YOU DANDY WAS DRIVEN ON THE STREETS OF A HUNDRED CITIES AND TOWNS AND I NEVER KNEW HIM TO BE AT A LOSS TO FIND HIS WAY TO THE STABLE OR WATERING TROUGH ONCE HE HAD BEEN THERE AND WAS STARTED ON A RETURN TRIP
