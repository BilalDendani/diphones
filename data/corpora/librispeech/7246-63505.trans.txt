7246-63505-0000 SHE SOON TOLD HIM THAT SHE SHARED HIS LOVE
7246-63505-0001 THAT THIS LOVE WOULD CREATE GREAT TROUBLE HE COULD NEVER BE HAPPY THE DISTANCE THAT SEPARATED THEM WAS TOO WIDE SHE THEN RECOMMENDED TO RODOLPH THE MOST PROFOUND DISCRETION
7246-63505-0002 FOR FEAR OF AROUSING THE GRAND DUKE'S SUSPICIONS AS HE WOULD BE INEXORABLE AND DEPRIVE THEM OF THEIR ONLY HAPPINESS THAT OF SEEING EACH OTHER EVERY DAY THE YOUNG PRINCE PROMISED TO BE CAUTIOUS AND CONCEAL HIS LOVE THE SCOTCH MAIDEN WAS TOO AMBITIOUS
7246-63505-0003 TOO SELF POSSESSED TO COMPROMISE AND BETRAY HERSELF IN THE EYES OF THE COURT AND RODOLPH PERCEIVING THE NECESSITY OF DISSIMULATION IMITATED SARAH'S PRUDENCE THE LOVERS SECRET WAS CAREFULLY PRESERVED FOR SOME TIME NOR WAS IT
7246-63505-0004 UNTIL THE BROTHER AND SISTER SAW THE UNBRIDLED PASSION OF THEIR DUPE REACH ITS UTMOST EXCESS AND THAT HIS INFATUATION WHICH HE COULD HARDLY RESTRAIN THREATENED TO BURST FORTH AFRESH AND DESTROY ALL THAT THEY RESOLVED
7246-63505-0005 ON THEIR FINAL COUP THE DOCTOR'S CHARACTER AUTHORISING THE CONFIDENCE BESIDES THE MORALITY WHICH INVESTED IT SEYTON OPENED TO HIM ON THE NECESSITY OF A MARRIAGE BETWEEN RODOLPH AND SARAH OTHERWISE
7246-63505-0006 HE ADDED WITH PERFECT SINCERITY HE AND HIS SISTER WOULD INSTANTLY LEAVE GEROLSTEIN SARAH PARTICIPATED IN THE PRINCE'S AFFECTION BUT PREFERRING DEATH TO DISHONOUR SHE COULD ONLY BE THE WIFE OF HIS HIGHNESS
7246-63505-0007 THIS EXALTED FLIGHT OF AMBITION STUPEFIED THE DOCTOR WHO HAD NEVER IMAGINED THAT SARAH'S IMAGINATION SOARED SO HIGH A MARRIAGE SURROUNDED BY NUMBERLESS DIFFICULTIES
7246-63505-0008 AND DANGERS APPEARED IMPOSSIBLE TO POLIDORI AND HE FRANKLY TOLD SEYTON THE REASONS WHY THE GRAND DUKE WOULD NEVER SUBMIT TO SUCH A UNION SEYTON AGREED IN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE REASONS BUT PROPOSED
7246-63505-0009 WHICH ALTHOUGH SECRET SHOULD BE LEGAL AND ONLY AVOWED AFTER THE DECEASE OF THE GRAND DUKE SARAH WAS OF A NOBLE AND ANCIENT HOUSE AND SUCH A UNION WAS NOT WITHOUT PRECEDENT
7246-63505-0010 SEYTON GAVE THE PRINCE EIGHT DAYS TO DECIDE HIS SISTER COULD NOT LONGER ENDURE THE CRUEL ANGUISH OF UNCERTAINTY AND IF SHE MUST RENOUNCE RODOLPH'S LOVE SHE MUST ACT UP TO HER PAINFUL RESOLVE AS PROMPTLY AS MIGHT BE
7246-63505-0011 CERTAIN THAT HE COULD NOT MISTAKE SARAH'S VIEWS THE DOCTOR WAS SORELY PERPLEXED HE HAD THREE WAYS BEFORE HIM TO INFORM THE GRAND DUKE OF THE MATRIMONIAL PROJECT TO OPEN RODOLPH'S EYES
7246-63505-0012 TO LEND HIMSELF TO THE MARRIAGE
7246-63505-0013 TO ENLIGHTEN RODOLPH ON THE INTERESTED VIEWS OF SARAH WAS TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE RECEPTION WHICH A LOVER IS SURE TO GIVE WHEN SHE WHOM HE LOVES IS DEPRECIATED IN HIS EYES AND THEN
7246-63505-0014 WHAT A BLOW FOR THE VANITY OR THE HEART OF THE YOUNG PRINCE TO LET HIM KNOW THAT IT WAS FOR HIS ROYAL RANK ALONE THAT THE LADY WAS DESIROUS TO WED HIM ON THE OTHER HAND BY LENDING HIMSELF TO THIS MATCH
7246-63505-0015 POLIDORI BOUND RODOLPH AND SARAH TO HIM BY A TIE OF THE STRONGEST GRATITUDE OR AT LEAST BY THE COMPLICITY OF A DANGEROUS ACT NO DOUBT ALL MIGHT BE DISCOVERED AND THE DOCTOR EXPOSED TO THE ANGER
7246-63505-0016 OF THE GRAND DUKE BUT THEN THE MARRIAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED THE UNION LEGAL THE STORM WOULD BLOW OVER AND THE FUTURE SOVEREIGN OF GEROLSTEIN WOULD BECOME THE MORE BOUND TO POLIDORI IN PROPORTION
7246-63505-0017 AFTER MUCH CONSIDERATION THEREFORE HE RESOLVED ON SERVING SARAH BUT WITH A CERTAIN QUALIFICATION WHICH WE WILL PRESENTLY REFER TO RODOLPH'S PASSION HAD REACHED A HEIGHT ALMOST OF FRENZY
7246-63505-0018 VIOLENTLY EXCITED BY CONSTRAINT AND THE SKILFUL MANAGEMENT OF SARAH WHO PRETENDED TO FEEL STILL MORE THAN HE DID THE INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLES
7246-63505-0019 WHICH HONOUR AND DUTY PLACED BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR LIBERTY IN A FEW DAYS MORE THE YOUNG PRINCE WOULD HAVE BETRAYED HIMSELF THUS
7246-63505-0020 OR POSSESS HER BY A SECRET MARRIAGE RODOLPH THREW HIMSELF ON POLIDORI'S NECK CALLED HIM HIS SAVIOUR HIS FRIEND HIS FATHER HE ONLY WISHED THAT THE TEMPLE AND THE PRIEST WERE AT HAND
7246-63505-0021 THAT HE MIGHT MARRY HER THAT INSTANT THE DOCTOR RESOLVED FOR REASONS OF HIS OWN
7246-63505-0022 THE MANAGEMENT OF ALL HE FOUND A PRIEST WITNESSES AND THE UNION ALL THE FORMALITIES OF WHICH WERE CAREFULLY SCRUTINISED AND VERIFIED BY SEYTON WAS SECRETLY CELEBRATED DURING A TEMPORARY ABSENCE
7246-63505-0023 OF THE GRAND DUKE AT A CONFERENCE OF THE GERMAN DIET THE PROPHECY OF THE SCOTCH SOOTHSAYER WAS FULFILLED SARAH WEDDED THE HEIR TO A THRONE WITHOUT QUENCHING THE FIRE OF HIS LOVE
7246-63505-0024 POSSESSION RENDERED RODOLPH MORE CIRCUMSPECT AND COOLED DOWN THAT VIOLENCE WHICH MIGHT HAVE COMPROMISED THE SECRET OF HIS PASSION FOR SARAH BUT DIRECTED BY SEYTON AND THE DOCTOR THE YOUNG COUPLE MANAGED SO WELL
7246-63505-0025 AND OBSERVED SO MUCH CIRCUMSPECTION TOWARDS EACH OTHER THAT THEY ELUDED ALL DETECTION AN EVENT IMPATIENTLY DESIRED BY SARAH SOON TURNED THIS CALM INTO A TEMPEST SHE WAS ABOUT TO BECOME A MOTHER
7246-63505-0026 IT WAS THEN THAT THIS WOMAN EVINCED ALL THOSE EXACTIONS WHICH WERE SO NEW TO AND SO MUCH ASTONISHED RODOLPH SHE PROTESTED WITH HYPOCRITICAL TEARS STREAMING FROM HER EYES
7246-63505-0027 THAT SHE COULD NO LONGER SUPPORT THE CONSTRAINT
7246-63505-0028 RENDERED THE MORE INSUPPORTABLE BY HER PREGNANCY IN THIS EXTREMITY SHE BOLDLY PROPOSED TO THE YOUNG PRINCE TO TELL ALL TO HIS FATHER
7246-63505-0029 FONDER THAN EVER OF HER NO DOUBT SHE ADDED HE WILL BE VERY ANGRY GREATLY ENRAGED AT FIRST BUT HE LOVES HIS SON SO TENDERLY SO BLINDLY AND HAD FOR HER SARAH SO STRONG
7246-63505-0030 AN AFFECTION THAT HIS PATERNAL ANGER WOULD GRADUALLY SUBSIDE AND SHE WOULD AT LAST TAKE IN THE COURT OF GEROLSTEIN THE RANK WHICH WAS DUE TO HER SHE MIGHT SAY IN A DOUBLE SENSE BECAUSE SHE WAS ABOUT
7246-63505-0031 TO GIVE BIRTH TO A CHILD WHICH WOULD BE THE HEIR PRESUMPTIVE TO THE GRAND DUKE THESE PRETENSIONS ALARMED RODOLPH HE KNEW THE DEEP ATTACHMENT WHICH HIS FATHER HAD FOR HIM
7246-63505-0032 BUT HE ALSO WELL KNEW THE INFLEXIBILITY OF HIS PRINCIPLES WITH REGARD TO ALL THE DUTIES OF A PRINCE TO ALL THESE OBJECTIONS SARAH REPLIED UNMOVED I AM YOUR WIFE IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND MEN
7246-63505-0033 IN A SHORT TIME I SHALL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO CONCEAL MY SITUATION AND I OUGHT NOT TO BLUSH AT THAT OF WHICH I AM ON THE CONTRARY SO PROUD AND WOULD DESIRE OPENLY TO ACKNOWLEDGE
7246-63505-0034 THE EXPECTATION OF POSTERITY HAD REDOUBLED RODOLPH'S TENDERNESS FOR SARAH AND PLACED BETWEEN THE DESIRE TO ACCEDE TO HER WISHES AND THE DREAD OF HIS FATHER'S WRATH HE EXPERIENCED THE BITTEREST ANGUISH
7246-63505-0035 SEYTON SIDED WITH HIS SISTER THE MARRIAGE IS INDISSOLUBLE SAID HE TO HIS ROYAL BROTHER IN LAW THE GRAND DUKE MAY EXILE YOU FROM HIS COURT YOU AND YOUR WIFE NOTHING MORE
7246-63505-0036 BUT HE LOVES YOU TOO MUCH TO HAVE RECOURSE TO SUCH AN EXTREMITY HE WILL ENDURE WHAT HE CANNOT PREVENT THESE REASONS STRONG ENOUGH IN THEMSELVES DID NOT SOOTHE RODOLPH'S ANXIETIES AT THIS JUNCTURE
7246-63505-0037 SEYTON WAS CHARGED BY THE GRAND DUKE WITH AN ERRAND TO VISIT SEVERAL BREEDING STUDS IN AUSTRIA THIS MISSION WHICH HE COULD NOT REFUSE WOULD ONLY DETAIN HIM A FORTNIGHT HE SET OUT WITH MUCH REGRET
7246-63505-0038 AND IN A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR HIS SISTER SHE WAS CHAGRINED YET SATISFIED AT THE DEPARTURE OF HER BROTHER FOR SHE WOULD LOSE HIS ADVICE BUT THEN HE WOULD BE SAFE FROM THE GRAND DUKE'S ANGER
7246-63505-0039 SARAH PROMISED TO KEEP SEYTON FULLY INFORMED DAY BY DAY OF THE PROGRESS OF EVENTS SO IMPORTANT TO BOTH OF THEM AND THAT THEY MIGHT CORRESPOND MORE SURELY AND SECRETLY THEY AGREED UPON A CIPHER
7246-63505-0040 OF BESIDES HER LOVE FOR RODOLPH IN TRUTH THIS SELFISH COLD AMBITIOUS WOMAN HAD NOT FELT THE ICE OF HER HEART MELT EVEN BY THE BEAMS OF THE PASSIONATE LOVE WHICH HAD BEEN BREATHED TO HER
7246-63505-0041 HER MATERNITY WAS ONLY WITH HER A MEANS OF ACTING MORE EFFECTUALLY ON RODOLPH AND HAD NO SOFTENING EFFECT ON HER IRON SOUL THE YOUTH HEADLONG LOVE AND
7246-63505-0042 AND SO PERFIDIOUSLY ENSNARED INTO AN INEXTRICABLE POSITION HARDLY EXCITED AN INTEREST IN THE MIND OF THIS SELFISH CREATURE AND IN HER CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH HIM
7246-63505-0043 WHO LIVED HOWEVER VERY LONG IN A WORD THIS CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE BROTHER AND SISTER CLEARLY DEVELOPED THEIR UNBOUNDED SELFISHNESS THEIR AMBITIOUS CALCULATIONS THEIR IMPATIENCE
7246-63505-0044 WHICH ALMOST AMOUNTED TO HOMICIDE AND LAID BARE THE SPRINGS OF THAT DARK CONSPIRACY CROWNED BY THE MARRIAGE OF RODOLPH ONE OF SARAH'S LETTERS TO HER BROTHER WAS ABSTRACTED BY POLIDORI
7246-63505-0045 THE CHANNEL OF THEIR MUTUAL COMMUNICATIONS FOR WHAT PURPOSE WE SHALL SEE HEREAFTER A FEW DAYS AFTER SEYTON'S DEPARTURE SARAH WAS AT THE EVENING COURT OF THE DOWAGER GRAND DUCHESS
7246-63505-0046 MANY OF THE LADIES PRESENT LOOKED AT HER WITH AN ASTONISHED AIR AND WHISPERED TO THEIR NEIGHBOURS THE GRAND DUCHESS JUDITH IN SPITE OF HER NINETY YEARS HAD A QUICK EAR AND A SHARP EYE AND THIS LITTLE WHISPERING DID NOT ESCAPE HER
7246-63505-0047 SHE MADE A SIGN TO ONE OF THE LADIES IN WAITING TO COME TO HER AND FROM HER SHE LEARNED THAT EVERYBODY WAS REMARKING THAT THE FIGURE OF MISS SARAH SEYTON OF HALSBURY WAS LESS SLENDER
7246-63505-0048 LESS DELICATE IN ITS PROPORTIONS THAN USUAL THE OLD PRINCESS ADORED HER YOUNG PROTEGEE AND WOULD HAVE ANSWERED TO GOD HIMSELF FOR SARAH'S VIRTUE INDIGNANT
7246-63505-0049 AT THE MALEVOLENCE OF THESE REMARKS SHE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AND SAID ALOUD FROM THE END OF THE SALOON IN WHICH SHE WAS SITTING MY DEAR SARAH COME HERE SARAH ROSE IT WAS
7246-63505-0050 REQUISITE TO CROSS THE CIRCLE TO REACH THE PLACE WHERE THE PRINCESS WAS SEATED WHO WAS ANXIOUS MOST KINDLY TO DESTROY THE RUMOUR THAT WAS CIRCULATED AND BY THE SIMPLE FACT OF THUS CROSSING THE ROOM
7246-63505-0051 CALUMNIATORS AND PROVE TRIUMPHANTLY THAT THE FAIR PROPORTIONS OF HER PROTEGEE HAD LOST NOT ONE JOT OF THEIR SYMMETRY AND DELICACY ALAS THE MOST
7246-63505-0052 PERFIDIOUS ENEMY COULD NOT HAVE DEVISED A BETTER PLAN THAN THAT SUGGESTED BY THE WORTHY PRINCESS IN HER DESIRE TO DEFEND HER PROTEGEE SARAH CAME TOWARDS HER
7246-63505-0053 AND IT REQUIRED ALL THE DEEP RESPECT DUE TO THE GRAND DUCHESS TO REPRESS THE MURMUR OF SURPRISE AND INDIGNATION WHEN THE YOUNG LADY CROSSED THE ROOM THE NEAREST SIGHTED PERSONS SAW WHAT SARAH
7246-63505-0054 WOULD NO LONGER CONCEAL FOR HER PREGNANCY MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIDDEN LONGER HAD SHE BUT HAVE CHOSEN BUT THE AMBITIOUS WOMAN HAD SOUGHT THIS DISPLAY IN ORDER TO COMPEL RODOLPH TO DECLARE HIS MARRIAGE
7246-63505-0055 THE GRAND DUCHESS WHO HOWEVER WOULD NOT BE CONVINCED IN SPITE OF HER EYESIGHT SAID IN A LOW VOICE TO SARAH MY DEAR CHILD HOW VERY ILL YOU HAVE DRESSED YOURSELF TO DAY YOU
7246-63505-0056 WHOSE SHAPE MAY BE SPANNED BY TEN FINGERS I HARDLY KNOW YOU AGAIN WE WILL RELATE HEREAFTER THE RESULTS OF THIS DISCOVERY WHICH LED TO GREAT AND TERRIBLE EVENTS AT THIS MOMENT
7246-63505-0057 WE WILL CONTENT OURSELVES WITH STATING WHAT THE READER HAS NO DOUBT ALREADY GUESSED THAT FLEUR DE MARIE WAS THE FRUIT OF THE
7246-63505-0058 AND THAT THEY BOTH BELIEVED THEIR DAUGHTER DEAD IT HAS NOT BEEN FORGOTTEN THAT RODOLPH AFTER HAVING VISITED THE HOUSE IN THE RUE DU TEMPLE
