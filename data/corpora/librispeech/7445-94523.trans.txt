7445-94523-0000 ALL THE NOBILITY OF FRANCE WERE ENGAGED IN THIS ENTERPRISE THE ENGLISH WERE KEPT IN ALARM GREAT PREPARATIONS WERE MADE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE INVADERS AND THOUGH THE DISPERSION OF THE FRENCH SHIPS BY A STORM
7445-94523-0001 THERE WERE TWO CIRCUMSTANCES CHIEFLY WHICH ENGAGED THE FRENCH AT THIS TIME TO THINK OF SUCH ATTEMPTS THE ONE WAS THE ABSENCE OF THE DUKE OF LANCASTER WHO HAD CARRIED INTO SPAIN THE FLOWER OF THE ENGLISH MILITARY FORCE
7445-94523-0002 THE SUBJECTION IN WHICH RICHARD WAS HELD BY HIS UNCLES PARTICULARLY BY THE DUKE OF GLOCESTER A PRINCE OF AMBITION AND GENIUS
7445-94523-0003 ROBERT DE VERE EARL OF OXFORD A YOUNG MAN OF A NOBLE FAMILY OF AN AGREEABLE FIGURE BUT OF DISSOLUTE MANNERS HAD ACQUIRED AN ENTIRE ASCENDANT OVER HIM
7445-94523-0004 THE KING SET SO LITTLE BOUNDS TO HIS AFFECTION THAT HE FIRST CREATED HIS FAVORITE MARQUIS OF DUBLIN
7445-94523-0005 FITZ ALAN EARL OF ARUNDEL PIERCY EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND MONTACUTE EARL OF SALISBURY BEAUCHAMP EARL OF WARWICK WERE ALL CONNECTED WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH THE PRINCES BY FRIENDSHIP OR ALLIANCE
7445-94523-0006 AND THE METHOD WHICH THEY TOOK TO REDRESS THE GRIEVANCE COMPLAINED OF WELL SUITED THE VIOLENCE OF THE AGE AND PROVES THE DESPERATE EXTREMITIES TO WHICH EVERY OPPOSITION WAS SURE TO BE INSTANTLY CARRIED
7445-94523-0007 AND WAS ESTEEMED THE PERSON OF GREATEST EXPERIENCE AND CAPACITY AMONG THOSE WHO WERE ATTACHED TO THE DUKE OF IRELAND AND THE KING'S SECRET COUNCIL THE DUKE OF GLOCESTER WHO HAD THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AT HIS DEVOTION
7445-94523-0008 A PLAIN INTIMATION OF THE FATE WHICH RICHARD IF HE CONTINUED REFRACTORY HAD REASON TO EXPECT FROM THEM THE KING FINDING HIMSELF UNABLE TO RESIST WAS CONTENT TO STIPULATE THAT EXCEPT FINISHING THE PRESENT IMPEACHMENT AGAINST SUFFOLK
7445-94523-0009 IN THE PRESENT PLENITUDE OF THEIR POWER THOUGHT PROPER TO OBJECT AGAINST HIM IT WAS ALLEGED THAT BEING CHANCELLOR AND OBLIGED BY HIS OATH TO CONSULT THE KING'S PROFIT HE HAD PURCHASED LANDS OF THE CROWN BELOW THEIR TRUE VALUE
7445-94523-0010 THAT HE HAD EXCHANGED WITH THE KING A PERPETUAL ANNUITY OF FOUR HUNDRED MARKS A YEAR WHICH HE INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER AND WHICH WAS ASSIGNED UPON THE CUSTOMS OF THE PORT OF HULL FOR LANDS OF AN EQUAL INCOME
7445-94523-0011 HE HAD REFUSED TO ADMIT THIS PERSON WHOSE TITLE WAS NOT LEGAL TILL HE MADE A COMPOSITION WITH HIS SON AND AGREED TO PAY HIM A HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR FROM THE INCOME OF THE BENEFICE
7445-94523-0012 BUT THEY IMMEDIATELY ATTACKED HIMSELF AND HIS ROYAL DIGNITY
7445-94523-0013 AND WHICH HAD ALWAYS BEEN ATTENDED WITH EXTREME CONFUSION BY THIS COMMISSION WHICH WAS RATIFIED BY PARLIAMENT A COUNCIL OF FOURTEEN PERSONS WAS APPOINTED
7445-94523-0014 AND THOUGH THE TERM OF THE COMMISSION WAS LIMITED IT WAS EASY TO FORESEE THAT THE INTENTIONS OF THE PARTY WERE TO RENDER IT PERPETUAL AND THAT POWER WOULD WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY BE WRESTED FROM THOSE GRASPING HANDS TO WHICH IT WAS ONCE COMMITTED RICHARD HOWEVER WAS OBLIGED TO SUBMIT
7445-94523-0015 HE SIGNED THE COMMISSION WHICH VIOLENCE HAD EXTORTED FROM HIM HE TOOK AN OATH NEVER TO INFRINGE IT AND THOUGH AT THE END OF THE SESSION HE PUBLICLY ENTERED A PROTEST THAT THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CROWN NOTWITHSTANDING HIS LATE CONCESSION
7445-94523-0016 THOUGH VASTLY RICH RECEIVED AT THE SAME TIME EACH OF THEM A THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR TOP SUPPORT THEIR DIGNITY AND TO SEEK THE MEANS BOTH OF RECOVERING HIS AUTHORITY AND OF REVENGING HIMSELF ON THOSE WHO HAD INVADED IT
7445-94523-0017 AS THE HOUSE OF COMMONS APPEARED NOW OF WEIGHT IN THE CONSTITUTION HE SECRETLY TRIED SOME EXPEDIENTS FOR PROCURING A FAVORABLE ELECTION HE SOUNDED SOME OF THE SHERIFFS WHO BEING AT THAT TIME BOTH THE RETURNING OFFICERS AND MAGISTRATES OF GREAT POWER IN THE COUNTIES
7445-94523-0018 MADE NO SCRUPLE OF ANSWERING IN THE WAY HE DESIRED THEY DECLARED THAT THE LATE COMMISSION WAS DEROGATORY TO THE ROYALTY AND PREROGATIVE OF THE KING THAT THOSE WHO PROCURED IT OR ADVISED THE KING TO CONSENT TO IT WERE PUNISHABLE WITH DEATH
7445-94523-0019 THAT THOSE WHO NECESSITATED AND COMPELLED HIM WERE GUILTY OF TREASON THAT THOSE WERE EQUALLY CRIMINAL WHO SHOULD PERSEVERE IN MAINTAINING IT THAT THE KING HAS THE RIGHT OF DISSOLVING PARLIAMENTS AT PLEASURE
7445-94523-0020 THAT THE PARLIAMENT WHILE IT SITS MUST FIRST PROCEED UPON THE KING'S BUSINESS AND THAT THIS ASSEMBLY CANNOT WITHOUT HIS CONSENT IMPEACH ANY OF HIS MINISTERS AND JUDGES EVEN ACCORDING TO OUR PRESENT STRICT MAXIMS WITH REGARD TO LAW AND THE ROYAL PREROGATIVE
7445-94523-0021 AND AS THE GREAT PRIVILEGES OF THE COMMONS PARTICULARLY THAT OF IMPEACHMENT
7445-94523-0022 THE DUKE OF GLOCESTER THE KING'S UNCLE THE EARL OF DERBY SON OF THE DUKE OF LANCASTER THE EARL OF ARUNDEL THE EARL OF WARWICK AND THE EARL OF NOTTINGHAM
7445-94523-0023 ENTERED BEFORE THE PARLIAMENT AN ACCUSATION OR APPEAL AS IT WAS CALLED
7445-94523-0024 AS SOON AS HE CAME TO LONDON WHICH THEY KNEW WAS WELL DISPOSED TO THEIR PARTY THEY SECRETLY ASSEMBLED THEIR FORCES AND APPEARED IN ARMS AT HARINGAY PARK NEAR HIGHGATE WITH A POWER WHICH RICHARD AND HIS MINISTERS WERE NOT ABLE TO RESIST
7445-94523-0025 AND DEMANDED THAT THE PERSONS WHO HAD SEDUCED HIM BY THEIR PERNICIOUS COUNSEL AND WERE TRAITORS BOTH TO HIM AND TO THE KINGDOM SHOULD BE DELIVERED UP TO THEM A FEW DAYS AFTER THEY APPEARED IN HIS PRESENCE ARMED AND ATTENDED WITH ARMED FOLLOWERS
7445-94523-0026 THEY THREW DOWN THEIR GAUNTLETS BEFORE THE KING AND FIERCELY OFFERED TO MAINTAIN THE TRUTH OF THEIR CHARGE BY DUEL THE PERSONS ACCUSED AND ALL THE OTHER OBNOXIOUS MINISTERS HAD WITHDRAWN OR HAD CONCEALED THEMSELVES
7445-94523-0027 GLOCESTER ENCOUNTERED HIM IN OXFORDSHIRE WITH MUCH SUPERIOR FORCES ROUTED HIM DISPERSED HIS FOLLOWERS AND OBLIGED HIM TO FLY INTO THE LOW COUNTRIES WHERE HE DIED IN EXILE A FEW YEARS AFTER
7445-94523-0028 THE REST WERE CITED TO APPEAR AND UPON THEIR ABSENTING THEMSELVES THE HOUSE OF PEERS AFTER A VERY SHORT INTERVAL WITHOUT HEARING A WITNESS WITHOUT EXAMINING A FACT OR DELIBERATING ON ONE POINT OF LAW DECLARED THEM GUILTY OF HIGH TREASON
7445-94523-0029 MANY OF THE ARTICLES WILL APPEAR NOT ONLY TO IMPLY NO CRIME IN THE DUKE OF IRELAND AND THE MINISTERS BUT TO ASCRIBE TO THEM ACTIONS WHICH WERE LAUDABLE AND WHICH THEY WERE BOUND BY THEIR ALLEGIANCE TO PERFORM
7445-94523-0030 THE FEW ARTICLES IMPEACHING THE CONDUCT OF THESE MINISTERS BEFORE THAT COMMISSION WHICH SUBVERTED THE CONSTITUTION AND ANNIHILATED ALL JUSTICE AND LEGAL AUTHORITY ARE VAGUE AND GENERAL SUCH AS THEIR ENGROSSING THE KING'S FAVOR
7445-94523-0031 NO BREACH OF ANY STATUTE AND THEIR ADMINISTRATION MAY THEREFORE BE CONCLUDED TO HAVE BEEN SO FAR INNOCENT AND INOFFENSIVE ALL THE DISORDERS INDEED SEEM TO HAVE PROCEEDED NOT FROM ANY VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OR ANY MINISTERIAL TYRANNY
7445-94523-0032 BUT MERELY FROM A RIVALSHIP OF POWER WHICH THE DUKE OF GLOCESTER AND THE GREAT NOBILITY AGREEABLY TO THE GENIUS OF THE TIMES CARRIED TO THE UTMOST EXTREMITY AGAINST THEIR OPPONENTS WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO REASON JUSTICE OR HUMANITY
7445-94523-0033 THOUGH THEY PLEADED THE FEAR OF THEIR LIVES AND THE MENACES OF THE KING'S MINISTERS AS THEIR EXCUSE LORD BEAUCHAMP OF HOLT SIR JAMES BERNERS AND JOHN SALISBURY WERE ALSO TRIED AND CONDEMNED FOR HIGH TREASON MERELY BECAUSE THEY HAD ATTEMPTED TO DEFEAT THE LATE COMMISSION
7445-94523-0034 BUT THE LIFE OF THE LATTER WAS SPARED THE FATE OF SIR SIMON BURLEY WAS MORE SEVERE
7445-94523-0035 AND HAD BEEN APPOINTED GOVERNOR TO RICHARD BY THE CHOICE OF THE LATE KING AND OF THE BLACK PRINCE HE HAD ATTENDED HIS MASTER FROM THE EARLIEST INFANCY OF THAT PRINCE
7445-94523-0036 SHE REMAINED THREE HOURS ON HER KNEES BEFORE THE DUKE OF GLOCESTER PLEADING FOR THAT GENTLEMAN'S LIFE
7445-94523-0037 THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE BOUND IN THEIR JUDICIAL CAPACITY TO FOLLOW THE RULES WHICH THEY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE KING AND COMMONS
7445-94523-0038 AND NEVER WOULD RECOVER THE ROYAL POWER WITHOUT THE MOST VIOLENT STRUGGLES AND CONVULSIONS BUT THE EVENT PROVED CONTRARY IN LESS THAN A TWELVEMONTH RICHARD WHO WAS IN HIS TWENTY THIRD YEAR
7445-94523-0039 AND WHEN NO ONE VENTURED TO CONTRADICT SO REASONABLE AN INTENTION HE DEPRIVED FITZ ALAN ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY OF THE DIGNITY OF CHANCELLOR AND BESTOWED THAT HIGH OFFICE ON WILLIAM OF WICKHAM BISHOP OF WINCHESTER
7445-94523-0040 THE BISHOP OF HEREFORD WAS DISPLACED FROM THE OFFICE OF TREASURER THE EARL OF ARUNDEL FROM THAT OF ADMIRAL EVEN THE DUKE OF GLOCESTER AND THE EARL OF WARWICK WERE REMOVED FOR A TIME FROM THE COUNCIL AND NO OPPOSITION WAS MADE TO THESE GREAT CHANGES
7445-94523-0041 HOWEVER THIS MAY BE RICHARD EXERCISED WITH MODERATION THE AUTHORITY WHICH HE HAD RESUMED HE SEEMED TO BE ENTIRELY RECONCILED TO HIS UNCLES AND THE OTHER GREAT MEN OF WHOM HE HAD SO MUCH REASON TO COMPLAIN
7445-94523-0042 HE NEVER ATTEMPTED TO RECALL FROM BANISHMENT THE DUKE OF IRELAND WHOM HE FOUND SO OBNOXIOUS TO THEM HE CONFIRMED BY PROCLAMATION THE GENERAL PARDON WHICH THE PARLIAMENT HAD PASSED FOR ALL OFFENCES
