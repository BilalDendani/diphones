5239-32139-0000 PRECISELY AS WE HAVE SEEN IT GOING EASTWARD UP THE MEDITERRANEAN PAST THE DARDANELLES AND FOUNDING ARYAN HAMITIC AND PROBABLY TURANIAN COLONIES ON THE FARTHER SHORES OF THE BLACK SEA AND ON THE CASPIAN
5239-32139-0001 AND IN THIS UNIVERSAL EMPIRE SENOR LOPEZ MUST FIND AN EXPLANATION OF THE SIMILARITY WHICH AS WE SHALL SHOW EXISTS BETWEEN THE SPEECH OF THE SOUTH AMERICAN PACIFIC COAST ON THE ONE HAND AND THE SPEECH OF GAUL IRELAND
5239-32139-0002 ENGLAND ITALY GREECE BACTRIA AND HINDOSTAN ON THE OTHER
5239-32139-0003 AND MEANS PRIMITIVE CHIEF AND MANCO
5239-32139-0004 WE HAVE HERE A TRADITION OF CASTES LIKE THAT PRESERVED IN THE FOUR TRIBAL NAMES OF ATHENS THE LABORING CLASS NATURALLY ENOUGH IN A NEW COLONY OBTAINED THE SUPREMACY
5239-32139-0005 AND BECAME IN TIME PEROU OR PERU WAS NOT THE NUBIAN ISLAND OF MEROU WITH ITS PYRAMIDS BUILT BY RED MEN A SIMILAR TRANSPLANTATION
5239-32139-0006 AND WHEN THE HINDOO PRIEST POINTS TO HIS SACRED EMBLEM WITH FIVE PROJECTING POINTS UPON IT AND TELLS US THAT THEY TYPIFY MERO AND THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THE WORLD DOES HE NOT REFER TO ATLANTIS AND ITS ANCIENT UNIVERSAL EMPIRE
5239-32139-0007 IT REMINDS US OF MENES MINOS ET CETERA WHO ARE FOUND AT THE BEGINNING OF SO MANY OF THE OLD WORLD TRADITIONS
5239-32139-0008 AND EVEN AUBURN HAIR THEY HAD REGULAR FEATURES LARGE HEADS AND LARGE BODIES THEIR DESCENDANTS ARE TO THIS DAY AN OLIVE SKINNED PEOPLE MUCH LIGHTER IN COLOR THAN THE INDIAN TRIBES SUBJUGATED BY THEM THEY WERE A GREAT RACE
5239-32139-0009 THE INCAS WERE SIMPLY AN OFFSHOOT WHO DESCENDING FROM THE MOUNTAINS SUBDUED THE RUDE RACES OF THE SEA COAST AND IMPOSED THEIR ANCIENT CIVILIZATION UPON THEM
5239-32139-0010 THIS WHOLE REGION WHEN THE SPANIARDS ARRIVED WAS A POPULOUS AND PROSPEROUS EMPIRE COMPLETE IN ITS CIVIL ORGANIZATION SUPPORTED BY AN EFFICIENT SYSTEM OF INDUSTRY AND PRESENTING A NOTABLE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT ARTS OF CIVILIZED LIFE
5239-32139-0011 THE COMPANIONS OF PIZARRO FOUND EVERYWHERE THE EVIDENCES OF A CIVILIZATION OF VAST ANTIQUITY CIECA DE LEON MENTIONS GREAT EDIFICES THAT WERE IN RUINS AT TIAHUANACA
5239-32139-0012 AN ARTIFICIAL HILL RAISED ON A GROUNDWORK OF STONE AND TWO STONE IDOLS APPARENTLY MADE BY SKILFUL ARTIFICERS TEN OR TWELVE FEET HIGH CLOTHED IN LONG ROBES
5239-32139-0013 IN THIS PLACE ALSO SAYS DE LEON THERE ARE STONES SO LARGE AND SO OVERGROWN THAT OUR WONDER IS EXCITED IT BEING INCOMPREHENSIBLE HOW THE POWER OF MAN COULD HAVE PLACED THEM WHERE WE SEE THEM
5239-32139-0014 THEY ARE VARIOUSLY WROUGHT AND SOME OF THEM HAVING THE FORM OF MEN MUST HAVE BEEN IDOLS NEAR THE WALLS ARE MANY CAVES AND EXCAVATIONS UNDER THE EARTH BUT IN ANOTHER PLACE FARTHER WEST ARE OTHER AND GREATER MONUMENTS SUCH AS LARGE GATE WAYS WITH HINGES
5239-32139-0015 PLATFORMS AND PORCHES EACH MADE OF A SINGLE STONE IT SURPRISED ME TO SEE THESE ENORMOUS GATE WAYS MADE OF GREAT MASSES OF STONE SOME OF WHICH WERE THIRTY FEET LONG FIFTEEN HIGH AND SIX THICK
5239-32139-0016 PRISONS FURNACES FOR SMELTING METALS AND ALMOST EVERY CONCOMITANT OF CIVILIZATION EXISTED IN THE ANCIENT CHIMU CAPITAL
5239-32139-0017 THE BUILDINGS HERE AS THROUGHOUT PERU WERE ALL CONSTRUCTED OF HEWN STONE AND HAD DOORS AND WINDOWS WITH POSTS SILLS AND THRESHOLDS OF STONE AT CUELAP IN NORTHERN PERU REMARKABLE RUINS WERE FOUND
5239-32139-0018 THE NATIVE TRADITIONS SAID THIS CITY WAS BUILT BY BEARDED WHITE MEN WHO CAME THERE LONG BEFORE THE TIME OF THE INCAS AND ESTABLISHED A SETTLEMENT
5239-32139-0019 THE PERUVIANS MADE LARGE USE OF AQUEDUCTS WHICH THEY BUILT WITH NOTABLE SKILL USING HEWN STONES AND CEMENT AND MAKING THEM VERY SUBSTANTIAL ONE EXTENDED FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES ACROSS SIERRAS AND OVER RIVERS
5239-32139-0020 THESE ROADS WERE FROM TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE FEET WIDE WERE MACADAMIZED WITH PULVERIZED STONE MIXED WITH LIME AND BITUMINOUS CEMENT AND WERE WALLED IN BY STRONG WALLS MORE THAN A FATHOM IN THICKNESS
5239-32139-0021 IN MANY PLACES THESE ROADS WERE CUT FOR LEAGUES THROUGH THE ROCK GREAT RAVINES WERE FILLED UP WITH SOLID MASONRY RIVERS WERE CROSSED BY SUSPENSION BRIDGES USED HERE AGES BEFORE THEIR INTRODUCTION INTO EUROPE
5239-32139-0022 EXTENDING FROM ONE DEGREE NORTH OF QUITO TO CUZCO AND FROM CUZCO TO CHILI IT WAS QUITE AS LONG AS THE TWO PACIFIC RAILROADS AND ITS WILD ROUTE AMONG THE MOUNTAINS WAS FAR MORE DIFFICULT SARMIENTO DESCRIBING IT SAID
5239-32139-0023 SHOULD SEE FIT TO ORDER THE CONSTRUCTION OF ANOTHER ROAD LIKE THAT WHICH LEADS FROM QUITO TO CUZCO OR THAT WHICH FROM CUZCO GOES TOWARD CHILI I CERTAINLY THINK HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE IT WITH ALL HIS POWER HUMBOLDT SAID
5239-32139-0024 THIS ROAD WAS MARVELLOUS NONE OF THE ROMAN ROADS I HAD SEEN IN ITALY IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE OR IN SPAIN APPEARED TO ME MORE IMPOSING THAN THIS WORK OF THE ANCIENT PERUVIANS
5239-32139-0025 ALONG THESE GREAT ROADS CARAVANSARIES WERE ESTABLISHED FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF TRAVELLERS THESE ROADS WERE ANCIENT IN THE TIME OF THE INCAS THEY WERE THE WORK OF THE WHITE AUBURN HAIRED BEARDED MEN FROM ATLANTIS THOUSANDS OF YEARS BEFORE THE TIME OF THE INCAS
5239-32139-0026 THEIR WORKS IN COTTON AND WOOL EXCEEDED IN FINENESS ANYTHING KNOWN IN EUROPE AT THAT TIME THEY HAD CARRIED IRRIGATION AGRICULTURE AND THE CUTTING OF GEMS TO A POINT EQUAL TO THAT OF THE OLD WORLD
5239-32139-0027 THEIR ACCUMULATIONS OF THE PRECIOUS METALS EXCEEDED ANYTHING PREVIOUSLY KNOWN IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD
5239-32139-0028 IN A DESCRIPTION OF ONE LOT OF GOLDEN ARTICLES SENT TO SPAIN IN FIFTEEN THIRTY FOUR BY PIZARRO THERE IS MENTION OF
5239-32139-0029 CAN ANY ONE READ THESE DETAILS AND DECLARE PLATO'S DESCRIPTION OF ATLANTIS TO BE FABULOUS SIMPLY BECAUSE HE TELLS US OF THE ENORMOUS QUANTITIES OF GOLD AND SILVER POSSESSED BY THE PEOPLE
5239-32139-0030 COVERED DOUBTLESS BY HUNDREDS OF FEET OF VOLCANIC DEBRIS AN AMOUNT OF GOLD AND SILVER EXCEEDING MANY TIMES THAT BROUGHT TO EUROPE FROM PERU MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA SINCE THE TIME OF COLUMBUS A TREASURE WHICH IF BROUGHT TO LIGHT WOULD REVOLUTIONIZE THE FINANCIAL VALUES OF THE WORLD
5239-32139-0031 ONE THEY WORSHIPPED THE SUN MOON AND PLANETS TWO THEY BELIEVED IN THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL THREE THEY BELIEVED IN THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY AND ACCORDINGLY EMBALMED THEIR DEAD
5239-32139-0032 FOUR THE PRIEST EXAMINED THE ENTRAILS OF THE ANIMALS OFFERED IN SACRIFICE AND LIKE THE ROMAN AUGURS DIVINED THE FUTURE FROM THEIR APPEARANCE
5239-32139-0033 SIX THEY DIVIDED THE YEAR INTO TWELVE MONTHS
5239-32139-0034 EIGHT THEY POSSESSED CASTES AND THE TRADE OF THE FATHER DESCENDED TO THE SON AS IN INDIA NINE THEY HAD BARDS AND MINSTRELS WHO SUNG AT THE GREAT FESTIVALS
5239-32139-0035 TEN THEIR WEAPONS WERE THE SAME AS THOSE OF THE OLD WORLD AND MADE AFTER THE SAME PATTERN ELEVEN THEY DRANK TOASTS AND INVOKED BLESSINGS TWELVE THEY BUILT TRIUMPHAL ARCHES FOR THEIR RETURNING HEROES AND STREWED THE ROAD BEFORE THEM WITH LEAVES AND FLOWERS
5239-32139-0036 THIRTEEN THEY USED SEDAN CHAIRS FOURTEEN THEY REGARDED AGRICULTURE AS THE PRINCIPAL INTEREST OF THE NATION AND HELD GREAT AGRICULTURAL FAIRS AND FESTIVALS FOR THE INTERCHANGE OF THE PRODUCTIONS OF THE FARMERS
5239-32139-0037 FIFTEEN THE KING OPENED THE AGRICULTURAL SEASON BY A GREAT CELEBRATION AND LIKE THE KINGS OF EGYPT HE PUT HIS HAND TO THE PLOUGH AND PLOUGHED THE FIRST FURROW SIXTEEN THEY HAD AN ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD IN WHICH THE CANDIDATE KNELT BEFORE THE KING
5239-32139-0038 HE WAS THEN ALLOWED TO USE THE GIRDLE OR SASH AROUND THE LOINS CORRESPONDING TO THE TOGA VIRILIS OF THE ROMANS HE WAS THEN CROWNED WITH FLOWERS
5239-32139-0039 IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO QUOTE MISTER FERGUSON'S WORDS THAT THE COINCIDENCE BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS OF THE INCAS AND THE CYCLOPEAN REMAINS ATTRIBUTED TO THE PELASGIANS IN ITALY AND GREECE IS THE MOST REMARKABLE IN THE HISTORY OF ARCHITECTURE
5239-32139-0040 OWL HEADED VASES TROY AND PERU
5239-32139-0041 THE SLOPING JAMBS THE WINDOW CORNICE THE POLYGONAL MASONRY AND OTHER FORMS SO CLOSELY RESEMBLE WHAT IS FOUND IN THE OLD PELASGIC CITIES OF GREECE AND ITALY THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO RESIST THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE MAY BE SOME RELATION BETWEEN THEM
5239-32139-0042 THE DOORS WERE FRAMED OF GOLD
5239-32139-0043 THAT A STUDY OF ANCIENT PERUVIAN POTTERY HAS CONSTANTLY REMINDED ME OF FORMS WITH WHICH WE ARE FAMILIAR IN EGYPTIAN ARCHAEOLOGY
5239-32139-0044 DOCTOR SCHLIEMANN IN HIS EXCAVATIONS OF THE RUINS OF TROY FOUND A NUMBER OF WHAT HE CALLS OWL HEADED IDOLS AND VASES
5239-32139-0045 IN PERU WE FIND VASES WITH VERY MUCH THE SAME STYLE OF FACE
5239-32139-0046 I MIGHT PURSUE THOSE PARALLELS MUCH FARTHER BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THESE EXTRAORDINARY COINCIDENCES MUST HAVE ARISEN EITHER FROM IDENTITY OF ORIGIN OR LONG CONTINUED ANCIENT INTERCOURSE
5239-32139-0047 THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT A FAIR SKINNED LIGHT HAIRED BEARDED RACE HOLDING THE RELIGION WHICH PLATO SAYS PREVAILED IN ATLANTIS CARRIED AN ATLANTEAN CIVILIZATION AT AN EARLY DAY UP THE VALLEY OF THE AMAZON TO THE HEIGHTS OF BOLIVIA AND PERU PRECISELY AS A SIMILAR EMIGRATION OF ARYANS WENT WESTWARD TO THE SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND CASPIAN AND IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT THESE DIVERSE MIGRATIONS HABITUALLY SPOKE THE SAME LANGUAGE
5239-32139-0048 SENOR LOPEZ FIRST COMBATS THE IDEA THAT THE LIVING DIALECT OF PERU IS BARBAROUS AND FLUCTUATING IT IS NOT ONE OF THE CASUAL AND SHIFTING FORMS OF SPEECH PRODUCED BY NOMAD RACES TO WHICH OF THE STAGES OF LANGUAGE DOES THIS BELONG
5239-32139-0049 THE AGGLUTINATIVE IN WHICH ONE ROOT IS FASTENED ON TO ANOTHER AND A WORD IS FORMED IN WHICH THE CONSTITUTIVE ELEMENTS ARE OBVIOUSLY DISTINCT OR THE INFLEXIONAL WHERE THE AUXILIARY ROOTS GET WORN DOWN AND ARE ONLY DISTINGUISHABLE BY THE PHILOLOGIST
5239-32139-0050 AND MANY AGAIN RESULT FROM THE CASUAL SPELLING OF THE SPANIARDS
5239-32139-0051 HUAKIA TO CALL
5239-32139-0052 TO SPEAK HUASI A HOUSE VAS TO INHABIT
5239-32139-0053 A STANI MEANS I CHANGE A THING'S PLACE FOR NI OR MI IS THE FIRST PERSON SINGULAR AND ADDED TO THE ROOT OF A VERB IS THE SIGN OF THE FIRST PERSON OF THE PRESENT INDICATIVE FOR INSTANCE
5239-32139-0054 SO LORD STRANGFORD WAS WRONG WHEN HE SUPPOSED THAT THE LAST VERB IN MI LIVED WITH THE LAST PATRIOT IN LITHUANIA PERU HAS STORES OF A GRAMMATICAL FORM WHICH HAS HAPPILY PERISHED IN EUROPE
5239-32139-0055 I LOVE MUNANI I SHALL LOVE MUNASA AND THAT THE AFFIXES DENOTING CASES IN THE NOUN ARE CURIOUSLY LIKE THE GREEK PREPOSITIONS
5239-32139-0056 WILL HERE BE OBSERVED VERY RECENTLY DOCTOR RUDOLF FALB HAS ANNOUNCED
5239-32139-0057 THAT IN FACT THEY EXHIBIT THE MOST ASTOUNDING AFFINITIES WITH THE SEMITIC TONGUE AND PARTICULARLY THE ARABIC IN WHICH TONGUE DOCTOR FALB HAS BEEN SKILLED FROM HIS BOYHOOD FOLLOWING UP THE LINES OF THIS DISCOVERY DOCTOR FALB HAS FOUND
5239-32139-0058 ONE A CONNECTING LINK WITH THE ARYAN ROOTS AND TWO HAS ULTIMATELY ARRIVED FACE TO FACE WITH THE SURPRISING REVELATION THAT THE SEMITIC ROOTS ARE UNIVERSALLY ARYAN
5239-32139-0059 SINCE THE ABOVE WAS WRITTEN I HAVE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM DOCTOR FALB DATED LEIPSIC APRIL FIFTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE
5239-32139-0060 THE MANUSCRIPT CONTAINS OVER TWO THOUSAND PAGES AND DOCTOR FALB HAS DEVOTED TO IT TEN YEARS OF STUDY A WORK FROM SUCH A SOURCE UPON SO CURIOUS AND IMPORTANT A SUBJECT WILL BE LOOKED FOR WITH GREAT INTEREST
5239-32139-0061 THE VERY TRADITIONS TO WHICH WE HAVE REFERRED AS EXISTING AMONG THE PERUVIANS
5239-32139-0062 AND ONLY IN THE DIRECTION OF ATLANTIS CAN WE LOOK FOR A WHITE AND BEARDED RACE IN FACT KINDRED RACES WITH THE SAME ARTS AND SPEAKING THE SAME TONGUE IN AN EARLY AGE OF THE WORLD SEPARATED IN ATLANTIS AND WENT EAST AND WEST
