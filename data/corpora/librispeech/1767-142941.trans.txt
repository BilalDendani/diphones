1767-142941-0000 BUTCHER THE SHRIKE WAS NOT THE ONLY NEWCOMER IN THE OLD ORCHARD THERE WAS ANOTHER STRANGER WHO PETER RABBIT SOON DISCOVERED WAS LOOKED ON WITH SOME SUSPICION BY ALL THE OTHER BIRDS OF THE OLD ORCHARD THE FIRST TIME PETER SAW HIM
1767-142941-0001 HE WAS WALKING ABOUT ON THE GROUND SOME DISTANCE OFF HE DIDN'T HOP BUT WALKED AND AT THAT DISTANCE HE LOOKED ALL BLACK
1767-142941-0002 IN FACT PETER MISTOOK HIM FOR CREAKER THAT WAS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T REALLY LOOK AT HIM
1767-142941-0003 PRESENTLY THE STRANGER FLEW UP IN A TREE AND PETER SAW THAT HIS TAIL WAS LITTLE MORE THAN HALF AS LONG AS THAT OF CREAKER AT ONCE IT CAME OVER PETER THAT THIS WAS A STRANGER TO HIM AND OF COURSE HIS CURIOSITY WAS AROUSED
1767-142941-0004 HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THIS WAS A MEMBER OF THE BLACKBIRD FAMILY BUT WHICH ONE IT COULD BE HE HADN'T THE LEAST IDEA JENNY WREN WILL KNOW THOUGHT PETER AND SCAMPERED OFF TO HUNT HER UP
1767-142941-0005 PETER ASKED AS SOON AS HE FOUND JENNY WREN THERE ISN'T ANY NEW MEMBER OF THE BLACKBIRD FAMILY LIVING IN THE OLD ORCHARD RETORTED JENNY WREN TARTLY THERE IS TOO CONTRADICTED PETER I SAW HIM WITH MY OWN EYES I CAN SEE HIM NOW HE'S SITTING IN THAT TREE OVER YONDER THIS VERY MINUTE
1767-142941-0006 HE'S ALL BLACK SO OF COURSE HE MUST BE A MEMBER OF THE BLACKBIRD FAMILY
1767-142941-0007 FELLOW ISN'T A MEMBER OF THE BLACKBIRD FAMILY AT ALL AND WHAT'S MORE HE ISN'T BLACK GO OVER THERE AND TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT HIM THEN COME BACK AND TELL ME IF YOU STILL THINK HE IS BLACK JENNY TURNED HER BACK ON PETER AND WENT TO HUNTING WORMS
1767-142941-0008 THERE BEING NOTHING ELSE TO DO PETER HOPPED OVER WHERE HE COULD GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE STRANGER
1767-142941-0009 AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT PETER THOUGHT AT FIRST GLANCE THEN AS THE STRANGER MOVED HE SEEMED TO BE A RICH PURPLE IN PLACES IN SHORT HE CHANGED COLOR AS HE TURNED HIS FEATHERS WERE LIKE THOSE OF CREAKER THE GRACKLE IRIDESCENT
1767-142941-0010 ALL OVER HE WAS SPECKLED WITH TINY LIGHT SPOTS UNDERNEATH HE WAS DARK BROWNISH GRAY HIS WINGS AND TAIL WERE OF THE SAME COLOR WITH LITTLE TOUCHES OF BUFF HIS RATHER LARGE BILL WAS YELLOW
1767-142941-0011 PETER HURRIED BACK TO JENNY WREN AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED HE LOOKED SHEEPISH YOU WERE RIGHT JENNY WREN HE ISN'T BLACK AT ALL CONFESSED PETER OF COURSE I WAS RIGHT I USUALLY AM RETORTED JENNY HE ISN'T BLACK
1767-142941-0012 HE ISN'T EVEN RELATED TO THE BLACKBIRD FAMILY AND HE HASN'T ANY BUSINESS IN THE OLD ORCHARD IN FACT IF YOU ASK ME HE HASN'T ANY BUSINESS IN THIS COUNTRY ANYWAY HE'S A FOREIGNER THAT'S WHAT HE IS A FOREIGNER BUT YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME WHO HE IS PROTESTED PETER
1767-142941-0013 HE IS SPECKLES THE STARLING AND HE ISN'T REALLY AN AMERICAN AT ALL REPLIED JENNY HE COMES FROM ACROSS THE OCEAN THE SAME AS BULLY THE ENGLISH SPARROW THANK GOODNESS HE HASN'T SUCH A QUARRELSOME DISPOSITION AS BULLY
1767-142941-0014 JUST THE SAME THE REST OF US WOULD BE BETTER SATISFIED IF HE WERE NOT HERE HE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF ONE OF THE OLD HOMES OF YELLOW WING THE FLICKER AND THAT MEANS ONE LESS HOUSE FOR BIRDS WHO REALLY BELONG HERE
1767-142941-0015 IF HIS FAMILY INCREASES AT THE RATE BULLY'S FAMILY DOES I'M AFRAID SOME OF US WILL SOON BE CROWDED OUT OF THE OLD ORCHARD DID YOU NOTICE THAT YELLOW BILL OF HIS PETER NODDED I CERTAINLY DID SAID HE I COULDN'T VERY WELL HELP NOTICING IT
1767-142941-0016 WELL THERE'S A FUNNY THING ABOUT THAT BILL REPLIED JENNY IN WINTER IT TURNS ALMOST BLACK MOST OF US WEAR A DIFFERENT COLORED SUIT IN WINTER BUT OUR BILLS REMAIN THE SAME WELL HE SEEMS TO BE PRETTY WELL FIXED HERE AND I DON'T SEE BUT WHAT THE THING FOR THE REST OF YOU BIRDS TO DO IS TO MAKE THE BEST OF THE MATTER
1767-142941-0017 SAID PETER WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHETHER OR NOT HE IS OF ANY USE I GUESS HE MUST DO SOME GOOD ADMITTED JENNY WREN RATHER GRUDGINGLY I'VE SEEN HIM PICKING UP WORMS AND GRUBS BUT HE LIKES GRAIN AND I HAVE A SUSPICION THAT IF HIS FAMILY BECOMES VERY NUMEROUS AND I SUSPECT IT WILL
1767-142941-0018 THEY WILL EAT MORE OF FARMER BROWN'S GRAIN THAN THEY WILL PAY FOR BY THE WORMS AND BUGS THEY DESTROY HELLO THERE'S DANDY THE WAXWING AND HIS FRIENDS A FLOCK OF MODESTLY DRESSED YET RATHER DISTINGUISHED LOOKING FEATHERED FOLKS
1767-142941-0019 HAD ALIGHTED IN A CHERRY TREE AND PROMPTLY BEGAN TO HELP THEMSELVES TO FARMER BROWN'S CHERRIES THEY WERE ABOUT THE SIZE OF WINSOME BLUEBIRD BUT DID NOT LOOK IN THE LEAST LIKE HIM FOR THEY WERE DRESSED ALMOST WHOLLY IN BEAUTIFUL RICH SOFT GRAYISH BROWN
1767-142941-0020 ACROSS THE END OF EACH TAIL WAS A YELLOW BAND ON EACH THE FOREHEAD CHIN AND A LINE THROUGH EACH EYE WAS VELVETY BLACK EACH WORE A VERY STYLISH POINTED CAP AND ON THE WINGS OF MOST OF THEM WERE LITTLE SPOTS OF RED WHICH LOOKED LIKE SEALING WAX
1767-142941-0021 AND FROM WHICH THEY GET THE NAME OF WAXWINGS THEY WERE SLIM AND TRIM AND QUITE DANDIFIED AND IN A QUIET WAY WERE REALLY BEAUTIFUL AS PETER WATCHED THEM HE BEGAN TO WONDER IF FARMER BROWN WOULD HAVE ANY CHERRIES LEFT
1767-142941-0022 BUT EVEN HE MARVELLED AT THE WAY THOSE BIRDS PUT THE CHERRIES OUT OF SIGHT IT WAS QUITE CLEAR TO HIM WHY THEY ARE OFTEN CALLED CHERRYBIRDS IF THEY STAY LONG FARMER BROWN WON'T HAVE ANY CHERRIES LEFT REMARKED PETER DON'T WORRY REPLIED JENNY WREN
1767-142941-0023 THEY WON'T STAY LONG I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY EQUAL TO THEM FOR ROAMING ABOUT HERE ARE MOST OF US WITH FAMILIES ON OUR HANDS AND MISTER AND MISSUS BLUEBIRD WITH A SECOND FAMILY
1767-142941-0024 WHILE THOSE GADABOUTS UP THERE HAVEN'T EVEN BEGUN TO THINK ABOUT HOUSEKEEPING YET THEY CERTAINLY DO LIKE THOSE CHERRIES
1767-142941-0025 HE MAY HAVE FEWER CHERRIES BUT HE'LL HAVE MORE APPLES BECAUSE OF THEM BOW'S THAT DEMANDED PETER OH REPLIED JENNY WREN THEY WERE OVER HERE A WHILE AGO WHEN THOSE LITTLE GREEN CANKERWORMS THREATENED TO EAT UP THE WHOLE ORCHARD
1767-142941-0026 AND THEY STUFFED THEMSELVES ON THOSE WORMS JUST THE SAME AS THEY ARE STUFFING THEMSELVES ON CHERRIES NOW THEY ARE VERY FOND OF SMALL FRUITS BUT MOST OF THOSE THEY EAT ARE THE WILD KIND WHICH ARE OF NO USE AT ALL TO FARMER BROWN OR ANYBODY ELSE NOW JUST LOOK AT THAT PERFORMANCE WILL YOU
1767-142941-0027 THERE WERE FIVE OF THE WAXWINGS AND THEY WERE NOW SEATED SIDE BY SIDE ON A BRANCH OF THE CHERRY TREE ONE OF THEM HAD A PLUMP CHERRY WHICH HE PASSED TO THE NEXT ONE
1767-142941-0028 PETER LAUGHED RIGHT OUT NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I SEEN SUCH POLITENESS SAID HE HUH EXCLAIMED JENNY WREN I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS POLITENESS AT ALL
1767-142941-0029 I GUESS IF YOU GOT AT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER YOU WOULD FIND THAT EACH ONE WAS STUFFED SO FULL THAT HE THOUGHT HE DIDN'T HAVE ROOM FOR THAT CHERRY AND SO PASSED IT ALONG WELL I THINK THAT WAS POLITENESS JUST THE SAME RETORTED PETER THE FIRST ONE MIGHT HAVE DROPPED THE CHERRY IF HE COULDN'T EAT IT INSTEAD OF PASSING IT ALONG
1767-142941-0030 JUST THEN THE WAXWINGS FLEW AWAY IT WAS THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER BEFORE PETER RABBIT AGAIN SAW DANDY THE WAXWING QUITE BY CHANCE HE DISCOVERED DANDY SITTING ON THE TIPTOP OF AN EVERGREEN TREE AS IF ON GUARD HE WAS ON GUARD FOR IN THAT TREE WAS HIS NEST
1767-142941-0031 IN FACT IT WAS SO LATE IN THE SUMMER THAT MOST OF PETER'S FRIENDS WERE THROUGH NESTING AND HE HAD QUITE LOST INTEREST IN NESTS PRESENTLY DANDY FLEW DOWN TO A LOWER BRANCH AND THERE HE WAS JOINED BY MISSUS WAXWING
