774-127930-0000 SPARGO SAT DOWN AGAIN IN THE CHAIR WHICH HE HAD JUST LEFT AND LOOKED AT THE TWO PEOPLE UPON WHOM HIS STARTLING ANNOUNCEMENT HAD PRODUCED SUCH A CURIOUS EFFECT AND HE RECOGNIZED AS HE LOOKED AT THEM THAT WHILE THEY WERE BOTH FRIGHTENED THEY WERE FRIGHTENED IN DIFFERENT WAYS
774-127930-0001 MISS BAYLIS HAD ALREADY RECOVERED HER COMPOSURE SHE NOW SAT SOMBRE AND STERN AS EVER RETURNING SPARGO'S LOOK WITH SOMETHING OF INDIFFERENT DEFIANCE HE THOUGHT HE COULD SEE THAT IN HER MIND A CERTAIN FEAR WAS BATTLING WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WONDER THAT HE HAD DISCOVERED THE SECRET
774-127930-0002 THE SECRET HAD COME TO AN END IT WAS AS IF SHE SAID IN SO MANY WORDS THAT NOW THE SECRET WAS OUT HE MIGHT DO HIS WORST BUT UPON MISTER SEPTIMUS ELPHICK THE EFFECT WAS VERY DIFFERENT HE WAS STILL TREMBLING FROM EXCITEMENT
774-127930-0003 HE GROANED AS HE SANK INTO HIS CHAIR AND THE HAND WITH WHICH HE POURED OUT A GLASS OF SPIRITS SHOOK THE GLASS RATTLED AGAINST HIS TEETH WHEN HE RAISED IT TO HIS LIPS
774-127930-0004 HE WAS A MAN WHO HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK AND A BAD ONE
774-127930-0005 THIS MAN KNOWS A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN A GREAT DEAL BEYOND THE MERE FACT THAT MARBURY WAS MAITLAND AND THAT RONALD BRETON IS IN REALITY MAITLAND'S SON
