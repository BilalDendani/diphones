7389-296084-0000 OPEN THE ATLAS ONCE MORE AT THE MAP OF RUSSIA AND LOOK DOWNWARD FROM THE CRIMEA ACROSS THE BLACK SEA TOWARD THE SOUTHWEST
7389-296084-0001 YOU SEE A NARROW STRAIT MARKED BOSPORUS LEADING FROM THE BLACK SEA TO THE SEA OF MARMORA AND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE STRAIT A BLACK DOT ONE MARKED CONSTANTINOPLE THE OTHER SCUTARI
7389-296084-0002 IT IS TO SCUTARI THAT WE ARE GOING BUT WE MUST NOT PASS THE OTHER PLACES WITHOUT A WORD FOR THEY ARE VERY FAMOUS THIS IS THE LAND OF STORY AND EVERY FOOT OF GROUND EVERY TRICKLE OF WATER
7389-296084-0003 TO CONCEAL HER FROM THE EYES OF HERA HIS JEALOUS WIFE ZEUS TURNED IO INTO A SNOW WHITE HEIFER BUT HERA SUSPECTING THE TRUTH PERSUADED HIM TO GIVE THE POOR PRETTY CREATURE TO HER
7389-296084-0004 THEN FOLLOWED A SAD TIME HERA SET ARGUS A GIANT WITH A HUNDRED EYES TO WATCH THE HEIFER
7389-296084-0005 THE POOR HEIFER MAIDEN WAS SO UNHAPPY THAT ZEUS SENT HERMES TO SET HER FREE AND THE CUNNING GOD TOLD STORIES TO ARGUS TILL HE FELL ASLEEP AND THEN CUT OFF HIS HEAD HUNDRED EYES AND ALL
7389-296084-0006 WHICH STUNG HER CRUELLY AND PURSUED HER OVER LAND AND SEA THE POOR CREATURE FLED WILDLY HITHER AND THITHER SWAM ACROSS THE IONIAN SEA WHICH HAS BORNE HER NAME EVER SINCE
7389-296084-0007 ROAMED OVER THE WHOLE BREADTH OF WHAT IS NOW TURKEY AND FINALLY CAME TO THE NARROW STRAIT OR FORD BETWEEN THE TWO SEAS
7389-296084-0008 AND HERE AGAIN SHE LEFT
7389-296084-0009 BUT IT IS VERY FAMOUS THOSE OF YOU WHO CARE ABOUT MOTHS WILL FIND ANOTHER REMINDER OF IO IN THE BEAUTIFUL SATURNIA IO WHICH IS NAMED FOR THE GREEK MAIDEN AND HER CRUEL FOE SATURNIA
7389-296084-0010 BEING ANOTHER NAME FOR HERA OR JUNO THE SCENERY ALONG THE BANKS OF THE BOSPORUS IS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT WHOLE BOOKS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT IT ON EITHER SIDE ARE SEVEN PROMONTORIES AND SEVEN BAYS
7389-296084-0011 INDEED IT IS ALMOST A CHAIN OF SEVEN LAKES CONNECTED BY SEVEN SWIFT RUSHING CURRENTS THE PROMONTORIES ARE CROWNED WITH VILLAGES TOWNS PALACES RUINS EACH WITH ITS OWN BEAUTY
7389-296084-0012 ITS OWN INTEREST ITS OWN STORY BUT WE CANNOT STAY FOR THESE WE MUST GO ONWARD TO WHERE AT THE LOWER END OF THE PASSAGE WITH ITS LONG NARROW HARBOR THE GOLDEN HORN CURLING ROUND IT
7389-296084-0013 LIES CONSTANTINOPLE THE WONDER CITY HERE INDEED WE MUST STOP FOR A MOMENT FOR THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS CITIES OF HISTORY IN ANCIENT DAYS WHEN ROME WAS IN HER GLORY
7389-296084-0014 AND LONG BEFORE IT WAS BYZANTIUM THAT LAY SHINING IN THE CURVE OF THE GOLDEN HORN BYZANTIUM THE RICH THE POWERFUL THE DESIRED OF ALL FOUGHT OVER THROUGH SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS BY PERSIAN
7389-296084-0015 GREEK GAUL AND ROMAN CONQUERED LIBERATED CONQUERED AGAIN IN THE SECOND CENTURY OF OUR ERA IT WAS BESIEGED BY THE ROMAN EMPEROR SEVERUS
7389-296084-0016 AND AFTER A HEROIC RESISTANCE LASTING THREE YEARS WAS TAKEN AND LAID WASTE BY THE CONQUEROR BUT THE CITY SPRANG UP AGAIN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER AND A CENTURY AND A HALF LATER
7389-296084-0017 NOT A PROPHET BUT A GREAT SOLDIER SURNAMED THE CONQUEROR WHO FINALLY CONQUERED IT IN FOURTEEN FIFTY THREE AFTER ANOTHER TREMENDOUS SIEGE OF WHICH YOU WILL READ IN HISTORY
7389-296084-0018 TOOK REFUGE IN THE GREAT CHURCH OF SAINT SOPHIA AND WERE THERE BARBAROUSLY SLAUGHTERED BY THE FEROCIOUS TURKS IN THE SOUTH AISLE OF THE CHURCH THE DEAD LAY PILED IN GREAT HEAPS
7389-296084-0019 AND IN OVER THIS DREADFUL RAMPART RODE MOHAMMED ON HIS WAR HORSE AND AS HE RODE HE LIFTED HIS BLOODY RIGHT HAND AND SMOTE ONE OF THE PILLARS AND THERE SO THE STORY SAYS
7389-296084-0020 FROM THAT TIME TO OUR OWN CONSTANTINOPLE HAS BEEN THE CAPITAL CITY OF THE TURKISH EMPIRE AGAIN I WISH I MIGHT TELL YOU ABOUT AT LEAST A FEW OF ITS MANY WONDERS FOR I HAVE SEEN SOME OF THEM
7389-296084-0021 IT IS TO THE LAST NAMED THAT WE ARE GOING ALTHOUGH ACTUALLY A SUBURB OF CONSTANTINOPLE SCUTARI IS A TOWN IN ITSELF AND A LARGE AND ANCIENT ONE
7389-296084-0022 IN THE EARLIEST TIMES OF THE GREAT PERSIAN MONARCHY IT WAS CALLED CHRYSOPOLIS THE GOLDEN CITY ITS PRESENT NAME MEANS IN PERSIAN A COURIER WHO CARRIES ROYAL ORDERS FROM STATION TO STATION
7389-296084-0023 BEEN A RENDEZVOUS FOR CARAVANS MESSENGERS TRAVELERS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION HERE XENOPHON AND HIS GREEKS RETURNING FROM THE WAR AGAINST CYRUS
7389-296084-0024 HALTED FOR SEVEN DAYS WHILE THE SOLDIERS DISPOSED OF THE BOOTY THEY HAD WON IN THE CAMPAIGN HERE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS STOOD THE THREE COLOSSAL STATUES
7389-296084-0025 FOR THE BURYING GROUND OF SCUTARI IS ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD AND ITS SILENT AVENUES HOLD SOME SAY
7389-296084-0026 IT IS A STRANGE PLACE THIS GREAT BURYING GROUND BESIDE EACH TOMB RISES A CYPRESS TREE TALL AND MAJESTIC THE TOMBS THEMSELVES ARE MOSTLY PILLARS OF MARBLE
7389-296084-0027 WITH A GLOBE OR BALL ON THE TOP AND PERCHED ATOP OF THIS GLOBE IS IN MANY CASES A TURBAN OR A FEZ CARVED IN STONE AND PAINTED IN GAY COLORS
7389-296084-0028 THE WOMEN'S TOMBS ARE MARKED BY A GRAPEVINE OR A STEM OF LOTUS ALSO CARVED IN MARBLE AT FOOT OF THE COLUMN IS A FLAT STONE HOLLOWED OUT IN THE MIDDLE TO FORM A SMALL BASIN
7389-296084-0029 SOME OF THESE BASINS ARE FILLED WITH FLOWERS OR PERFUMES IN OTHERS THE RAIN AND DEW MAKE A PLEASANT BATHING AND DRINKING PLACE FOR THE BIRDS WHO FLY IN GREAT FLOCKS ABOUT THE QUIET PLACE
7389-296084-0030 NOT FAR FROM THIS GREAT CEMETERY IS ANOTHER PLACE OF BURIAL THAT OF THE ENGLISH AND THIS IS LAID OUT LIKE A LOVELY GARDEN AND WATCHED AND TENDED WITH LOVING CARE
7389-296084-0031 FOR HERE REST THE BRAVE MEN WHO FELL IN THIS TERRIBLE WAR OF THE CRIMEA
7389-296084-0032 THAT TOWERS FOURSQUARE OVER ALL THE NEIGHBORHOOD WE MUST LOOK WELL AT THIS BUILDING THE BARRACK HOSPITAL OF SCUTARI FOR THIS IS WHAT FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE CAME SO FAR TO SEE
7389-296084-0033 THROUGH ALL THE LONG WEARISOME JOURNEY
7389-296084-0034 HER EYES WERE SET STEADFASTLY FORWARD FOLLOWING HER SWIFT THOUGHTS AND EYES AND THOUGHTS SOUGHT THIS ONE THING THIS GAUNT BARE BUILDING RISING BESIDE THE NEW MADE GRAVES
