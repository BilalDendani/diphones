1806-2536-0000 INTRODUCTION AS THIS WORK PROFESSES IN ITS TITLE PAGE TO BE A DESCRIPTIVE TALE THEY WHO WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE TO READ IT MAY BE GLAD TO KNOW HOW MUCH OF ITS CONTENTS
1806-2536-0001 IS LITERAL FACT AND HOW MUCH IS INTENDED TO REPRESENT A GENERAL PICTURE THE AUTHOR IS VERY SENSIBLE THAT HAD HE CONFINED HIMSELF TO THE LATTER
1806-2536-0002 ALWAYS THE MOST EFFECTIVE AS IT IS THE MOST VALUABLE MODE OF CONVEYING KNOWLEDGE OF THIS NATURE HE WOULD HAVE MADE A FAR BETTER BOOK BUT IN COMMENCING TO DESCRIBE SCENES AND PERHAPS HE MAY ADD CHARACTERS
1806-2536-0003 THAT WERE SO FAMILIAR TO HIS OWN YOUTH THERE WAS A CONSTANT TEMPTATION TO DELINEATE THAT WHICH HE HAD KNOWN RATHER THAN THAT WHICH HE MIGHT HAVE IMAGINED THIS RIGID ADHESION TO TRUTH
1806-2536-0004 AN INDISPENSABLE REQUISITE IN HISTORY AND TRAVELS DESTROYS THE CHARM OF FICTION FOR ALL THAT IS NECESSARY TO BE CONVEYED TO THE MIND BY THE LATTER HAD BETTER BE DONE
1806-2536-0005 THERE CAN BE NO MISTAKE AS TO THE SITE OF THE TALE THE HISTORY OF THIS DISTRICT OF COUNTRY
1806-2536-0006 IN A SUBSEQUENT DIVISION OF TERRITORY A PART OF MONTGOMERY AND FINALLY HAVING OBTAINED A SUFFICIENT POPULATION OF ITS OWN IT WAS SET APART AS A COUNTY BY ITSELF SHORTLY AFTER THE PEACE OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE
1806-2536-0007 OR NORTHERLY INTO ONTARIO AND ITS OUTLET OTSEGO LAKE BEING THE SOURCE OF THE SUSQUEHANNA IS OF NECESSITY AMONG ITS HIGHEST LANDS THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY THE CLIMATE AS IT WAS FOUND BY THE WHITES
1806-2536-0008 AND SEGO OR SAGO THE ORDINARY TERM OF SALUTATION USED BY THE INDIANS OF THIS REGION THERE IS A TRADITION WHICH SAYS THAT THE NEIGHBORING TRIBES WERE ACCUSTOMED TO MEET ON THE BANKS OF THE LAKE
1806-2536-0009 TO MAKE THEIR TREATIES AND OTHERWISE TO STRENGTHEN THEIR ALLIANCES AND WHICH REFERS THE NAME TO THIS PRACTICE AS THE INDIAN AGENT OF NEW YORK HAD A LOG DWELLING AT THE FOOT OF THE LAKE HOWEVER
1806-2536-0010 THE AUTHOR REMEMBERS IT A FEW YEARS LATER REDUCED TO THE HUMBLE OFFICE OF A SMOKE HOUSE
1806-2536-0011 WHENCE IT CUT A LANE THROUGH THE FOREST TO THE HEAD OF THE OTSEGO THE BOATS AND BAGGAGE WERE CARRIED OVER THIS PORTAGE AND THE TROOPS PROCEEDED TO THE OTHER EXTREMITY OF THE LAKE
1806-2536-0012 A NARROW THOUGH RAPID STREAM AT ITS SOURCE WAS MUCH FILLED WITH FLOOD WOOD OR FALLEN TREES AND THE TROOPS ADOPTED A NOVEL EXPEDIENT TO FACILITATE THEIR PASSAGE THE OTSEGO
1806-2536-0013 WHICH MAY HAVE A WIDTH OF TWO HUNDRED FEET THIS GORGE WAS DAMMED AND THE WATERS OF THE LAKE COLLECTED THE SUSQUEHANNA WAS CONVERTED INTO A RILL WHEN ALL WAS READY
1806-2536-0014 THE TROOPS EMBARKED THE DAMN WAS KNOCKED AWAY THE OTSEGO POURED OUT ITS TORRENT AND THE BOATS WENT MERRILY DOWN WITH THE CURRENT GENERAL JAMES CLINTON THE BROTHER OF GEORGE CLINTON
1806-2536-0015 THE GRAVE OF THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN WAS THE FIRST PLACE OF HUMAN INTERMENT THAT THE AUTHOR EVER BEHELD AS THE SMOKE HOUSE WAS THE FIRST RUIN THE SWIVEL ALLUDED TO IN THIS WORK
1806-2536-0016 WAS BURIED AND ABANDONED BY THE TROOPS ON THIS OCCASION AND IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND IN DIGGING THE CELLARS OF THE AUTHORS PATERNAL RESIDENCE SOON AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE WAR WASHINGTON
1806-2536-0017 ACCOMPANIED BY MANY DISTINGUISHED MEN VISITED THE SCENE OF THIS TALE IT IS SAID WITH A VIEW TO EXAMINE THE FACILITIES FOR OPENING A COMMUNICATION BY WATER WITH OTHER POINTS OF THE COUNTRY HE STAYED BUT A FEW HOURS
1806-2536-0018 IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE THE AUTHOR'S FATHER WHO HAD AN INTEREST IN EXTENSIVE TRACTS OF LAND IN THIS WILDERNESS ARRIVED WITH A PARTY OF SURVEYORS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SCENE MET HIS EYE IS DESCRIBED BY JUDGE TEMPLE
1806-2536-0019 AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE SETTLEMENT BEGAN AND FROM THAT TIME TO THIS THE COUNTRY HAS CONTINUED TO FLOURISH
1806-2536-0020 THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY WHEN THE PROPRIETOR OF THE ESTATE HAD OCCASION FOR SETTLERS ON A NEW SETTLEMENT AND IN A REMOTE COUNTY HE WAS ENABLED TO DRAW THEM FROM AMONG THE INCREASE OF THE FORMER COLONY
1806-2536-0021 PERHAPS HIS MOTHER HAD A REASONABLE DISTRUST OF THE PRACTICE OF DOCTOR TODD WHO MUST THEN HAVE BEEN IN THE NOVITIATE OF HIS EXPERIMENTAL ACQUIREMENTS BE THAT AS IT MAY THE AUTHOR WAS BROUGHT AN INFANT INTO THIS VALLEY
1806-2536-0022 AND ALL HIS FIRST IMPRESSIONS WERE HERE OBTAINED HE HAS INHABITED IT EVER SINCE AT INTERVALS AND HE THINKS HE CAN ANSWER FOR THE FAITHFULNESS OF THE PICTURE HE HAS DRAWN
1806-2536-0023 OTSEGO HAS NOW BECOME ONE OF THE MOST POPULOUS DISTRICTS OF NEW YORK IT SENDS FORTH ITS EMIGRANTS LIKE ANY OTHER OLD REGION AND IT IS PREGNANT WITH INDUSTRY AND ENTERPRISE
1806-2536-0024 ITS MANUFACTURERS ARE PROSPEROUS AND IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK THAT ONE OF THE MOST INGENIOUS MACHINES KNOWN IN EUROPEAN ART
1806-2536-0025 WHICH IS EXERCISED IN THIS REMOTE REGION IN ORDER TO PREVENT MISTAKE IT MAY BE WELL TO SAY THAT THE INCIDENTS OF THIS TALE ARE PURELY A FICTION
1806-2536-0026 THE LITERAL FACTS ARE CHIEFLY CONNECTED WITH THE NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL OBJECTS AND THE CUSTOMS OF THE INHABITANTS THUS THE ACADEMY AND COURT HOUSE AND JAIL AND INN AND MOST SIMILAR THINGS
1806-2536-0027 IT WAS ERECTED IN AN AGE TOO PRIMITIVE FOR THAT AMBITIOUS SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE BUT THE AUTHOR INDULGED HIS RECOLLECTIONS FREELY WHEN HE HAD FAIRLY ENTERED THE DOOR HERE ALL IS LITERAL
1806-2536-0028 THOUGH FORESTS STILL CROWN THE MOUNTAINS OF OTSEGO THE BEAR THE WOLF AND THE PANTHER ARE NEARLY STRANGERS TO THEM EVEN THE INNOCENT DEER IS RARELY SEEN BOUNDING BENEATH THEIR ARCHES
1806-2536-0029 FOR THE RIFLE AND THE ACTIVITY OF THE SETTLERS HARE DRIVEN THEM TO OTHER HAUNTS TO THIS CHANGE WHICH IN SOME PARTICULARS IS MELANCHOLY TO ONE WHO KNEW THE COUNTRY IN ITS INFANCY IT MAY BE ADDED
1806-2536-0030 THE AUTHOR HAS ELSEWHERE SAID THAT THE CHARACTER OF LEATHER STOCKING IS A CREATION RENDERED PROBABLE BY SUCH AUXILIARIES AS WERE NECESSARY TO PRODUCE THAT EFFECT
1806-2536-0031 HAD HE DRAWN STILL MORE UPON FANCY THE LOVERS OF FICTION WOULD NOT HAVE SO MUCH CAUSE FOR THEIR OBJECTIONS TO HIS WORK STILL THE PICTURE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE LEAST TRUE WITHOUT SOME SUBSTITUTES
1806-2536-0032 THE PIOUS SELF DENYING LABORIOUS AND ILL PAID MISSIONARY THE HALF EDUCATED LITIGIOUS ENVIOUS AND DISREPUTABLE LAWYER WITH HIS COUNTERPOISE A BROTHER OF THE PROFESSION OF BETTER ORIGIN AND OF BETTER CHARACTER
1806-2536-0033 THE SHIFTLESS BARGAINING DISCONTENTED SELLER OF HIS BETTERMENTS THE PLAUSIBLE CARPENTER AND MOST OF THE OTHERS ARE MORE FAMILIAR TO ALL WHO HAVE EVER DWELT IN A NEW COUNTRY
1806-2536-0034 IT HAS BEEN OFTEN SAID AND IN PUBLISHED STATEMENTS THAT THE HEROINE OF THIS BOOK WAS DRAWN AFTER THE SISTER OF THE WRITER WHO WAS KILLED BY A FALL FROM A HORSE NOW NEAR HALF A CENTURY SINCE
1806-2536-0035 SO INGENIOUS IS CONJECTURE THAT A PERSONAL RESEMBLANCE HAS BEEN DISCOVERED BETWEEN THE FICTITIOUS CHARACTER AND THE DECEASED RELATIVE IT IS SCARCELY POSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE TWO FEMALES
1806-2536-0036 OF THE SAME CLASS IN LIFE WHO WOULD BE LESS ALIKE PERSONALLY THAN ELIZABETH TEMPLE
1806-2536-0037 WHO MET WITH THE DEPLORABLE FATE MENTIONED IN A WORD
1806-2536-0038 WERE IT NOT STILL MORE PAINFUL TO HAVE IT BELIEVED THAT ONE WHOM HE REGARDED WITH A REVERENCE THAT SURPASSED THE LOVE OF A BROTHER WAS CONVERTED BY HIM INTO THE HEROINE OF A WORK OF FICTION
1806-2536-0039 FROM CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH AFTER THIS INTRODUCTION WILL BE OBVIOUS TO ALL THE AUTHOR HAS HAD MORE PLEASURE IN WRITING THE PIONEERS THAN THE BOOK WILL PROBABLY EVER GIVE ANY OF ITS READERS
1806-2536-0040 HE IS QUITE AWARE OF ITS NUMEROUS FAULTS SOME OF WHICH HE HAS ENDEAVORED TO REPAIR IN THIS EDITION BUT AS HE HAS IN INTENTION AT LEAST DONE HIS FULL SHARE
