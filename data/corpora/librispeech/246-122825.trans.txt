246-122825-0000 THE BEGINNING OF VACATION ANNE LOCKED THE SCHOOLHOUSE DOOR ON A STILL YELLOW EVENING WHEN THE WINDS WERE PURRING IN THE SPRUCES AROUND THE PLAYGROUND AND THE SHADOWS WERE LONG AND LAZY BY THE EDGE OF THE WOODS
246-122825-0001 SHE DROPPED THE KEY INTO HER POCKET WITH A SIGH OF SATISFACTION THE SCHOOL YEAR WAS ENDED SHE HAD BEEN REENGAGED FOR THE NEXT WITH MANY EXPRESSIONS OF SATISFACTION ONLY MISTER HARMON ANDREWS TOLD HER SHE OUGHT TO USE THE STRAP OFTENER
246-122825-0002 AND TWO DELIGHTFUL MONTHS OF A WELL EARNED VACATION BECKONED HER INVITINGLY ANNE FELT AT PEACE WITH THE WORLD AND HERSELF AS SHE WALKED DOWN THE HILL WITH HER BASKET OF FLOWERS IN HER HAND
246-122825-0003 SINCE THE EARLIEST MAYFLOWERS ANNE HAD NEVER MISSED HER WEEKLY PILGRIMAGE TO MATTHEW'S GRAVE EVERYONE ELSE IN AVONLEA EXCEPT MARILLA HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN QUIET SHY UNIMPORTANT MATTHEW CUTHBERT
246-122825-0004 BUT HIS MEMORY WAS STILL GREEN IN ANNE'S HEART AND ALWAYS WOULD BE SHE COULD NEVER FORGET THE KIND OLD MAN WHO HAD BEEN THE FIRST TO GIVE HER THE LOVE AND SYMPATHY HER STARVED CHILDHOOD HAD CRAVED
246-122825-0005 AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL A BOY WAS SITTING ON THE FENCE IN THE SHADOW OF THE SPRUCES A BOY WITH BIG DREAMY EYES AND A BEAUTIFUL SENSITIVE FACE HE SWUNG DOWN AND JOINED ANNE SMILING BUT THERE WERE TRACES OF TEARS ON HIS CHEEKS
246-122825-0006 I THOUGHT I'D WAIT FOR YOU TEACHER BECAUSE I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO THE GRAVEYARD HE SAID SLIPPING HIS HAND INTO HERS I'M GOING THERE TOO I'M TAKING THIS BOUQUET OF GERANIUMS TO PUT ON GRANDPA IRVING'S GRAVE FOR GRANDMA
246-122825-0007 AND LOOK TEACHER I'M GOING TO PUT THIS BUNCH OF WHITE ROSES BESIDE GRANDPA'S GRAVE IN MEMORY OF MY LITTLE MOTHER BECAUSE I CAN'T GO TO HER GRAVE TO PUT IT THERE BUT DON'T YOU THINK SHE'LL KNOW ALL ABOUT IT JUST THE SAME
246-122825-0008 YES I AM SURE SHE WILL PAUL YOU SEE TEACHER IT'S JUST THREE YEARS TODAY SINCE MY LITTLE MOTHER DIED IT'S SUCH A LONG LONG TIME BUT IT HURTS JUST AS MUCH AS EVER AND I MISS HER JUST AS MUCH AS EVER
246-122825-0009 SOMETIMES IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I JUST CAN'T BEAR IT IT HURTS SO PAUL'S VOICE QUIVERED AND HIS LIP TREMBLED HE LOOKED DOWN AT HIS ROSES HOPING THAT HIS TEACHER WOULD NOT NOTICE THE TEARS IN HIS EYES AND YET
246-122825-0010 SAID ANNE VERY SOFTLY YOU WOULDN'T WANT IT TO STOP HURTING YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO FORGET YOUR LITTLE MOTHER EVEN IF YOU COULD NO INDEED I WOULDN'T THAT'S JUST THE WAY I FEEL YOU'RE SO GOOD AT UNDERSTANDING TEACHER
246-122825-0011 NOBODY ELSE UNDERSTANDS SO WELL NOT EVEN GRANDMA ALTHOUGH SHE'S SO GOOD TO ME FATHER UNDERSTOOD PRETTY WELL BUT STILL I COULDN'T TALK MUCH TO HIM ABOUT MOTHER BECAUSE IT MADE HIM FEEL SO BAD
246-122825-0012 WHEN HE PUT HIS HAND OVER HIS FACE I ALWAYS KNEW IT WAS TIME TO STOP POOR FATHER HE MUST BE DREADFULLY LONESOME WITHOUT ME BUT YOU SEE HE HAS NOBODY BUT A HOUSEKEEPER NOW AND HE THINKS HOUSEKEEPERS ARE NO GOOD TO BRING UP LITTLE BOYS
246-122825-0013 ESPECIALLY WHEN HE HAS TO BE AWAY FROM HOME SO MUCH ON BUSINESS GRANDMOTHERS ARE BETTER NEXT TO MOTHERS SOMEDAY WHEN I'M BROUGHT UP I'LL GO BACK TO FATHER AND WE'RE NEVER GOING TO BE PARTED AGAIN
246-122825-0014 PAUL HAD TALKED SO MUCH TO ANNE ABOUT HIS MOTHER AND FATHER THAT SHE FELT AS IF SHE HAD KNOWN THEM SHE THOUGHT HIS MOTHER MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIKE WHAT HE WAS HIMSELF IN TEMPERAMENT AND DISPOSITION AND SHE HAD AN IDEA THAT STEPHEN IRVING
246-122825-0015 WAS A RATHER RESERVED MAN WITH A DEEP AND TENDER NATURE WHICH HE KEPT HIDDEN SCRUPULOUSLY FROM THE WORLD FATHER'S NOT VERY EASY TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH PAUL HAD SAID ONCE I NEVER GOT REALLY ACQUAINTED WITH HIM UNTIL AFTER MY LITTLE MOTHER DIED
246-122825-0016 BUT HE'S SPLENDID WHEN YOU DO GET TO KNOW HIM I LOVE HIM THE BEST IN ALL THE WORLD AND GRANDMA IRVING NEXT AND THEN YOU TEACHER I'D LOVE YOU NEXT TO FATHER IF IT WASN'T MY DUTY TO LOVE GRANDMA IRVING BEST BECAUSE SHE'S DOING SO MUCH FOR ME
246-122825-0017 YOU KNOW TEACHER I WISH SHE WOULD LEAVE THE LAMP IN MY ROOM TILL I GO TO SLEEP THOUGH SHE TAKES IT RIGHT OUT AS SOON AS SHE TUCKS ME UP BECAUSE SHE SAYS I MUSTN'T BE A COWARD I'M NOT SCARED BUT I'D RATHER HAVE THE LIGHT
246-122825-0018 MY LITTLE MOTHER USED ALWAYS TO SIT BESIDE ME AND HOLD MY HAND TILL I WENT TO SLEEP I EXPECT SHE SPOILED ME MOTHERS DO SOMETIMES YOU KNOW NO ANNE DID NOT KNOW THIS ALTHOUGH SHE MIGHT IMAGINE IT SHE THOUGHT SADLY OF HER LITTLE MOTHER
246-122825-0019 THE MOTHER WHO HAD THOUGHT HER SO PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL AND WHO HAD DIED SO LONG AGO AND WAS BURIED BESIDE HER BOYISH HUSBAND IN THAT UNVISITED GRAVE FAR AWAY ANNE COULD NOT REMEMBER HER MOTHER AND FOR THIS REASON SHE ALMOST ENVIED PAUL
246-122825-0020 MY BIRTHDAY IS NEXT WEEK SAID PAUL AS THEY WALKED UP THE LONG RED HILL BASKING IN THE JUNE SUNSHINE AND FATHER WROTE ME THAT HE IS SENDING ME SOMETHING THAT HE THINKS I'LL LIKE BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE COULD SEND
246-122825-0021 I BELIEVE IT HAS COME ALREADY FOR GRANDMA IS KEEPING THE BOOKCASE DRAWER LOCKED AND THAT IS SOMETHING NEW AND WHEN I ASKED HER WHY SHE JUST LOOKED MYSTERIOUS AND SAID LITTLE BOYS MUSTN'T BE TOO CURIOUS IT'S VERY EXCITING TO HAVE A BIRTHDAY ISN'T IT
246-122825-0022 I'LL BE ELEVEN YOU'D NEVER THINK IT TO LOOK AT ME WOULD YOU GRANDMA SAYS I'M VERY SMALL FOR MY AGE AND THAT IT'S ALL BECAUSE I DON'T EAT ENOUGH PORRIDGE I DO MY VERY BEST BUT GRANDMA GIVES SUCH GENEROUS PLATEFULS
246-122825-0023 THERE'S NOTHING MEAN ABOUT GRANDMA I CAN TELL YOU EVER SINCE YOU AND I HAD THAT TALK ABOUT PRAYING GOING HOME FROM SUNDAY SCHOOL THAT DAY TEACHER WHEN YOU SAID WE OUGHT TO PRAY ABOUT ALL OUR DIFFICULTIES
246-122825-0024 I'VE PRAYED EVERY NIGHT THAT GOD WOULD GIVE ME ENOUGH GRACE TO ENABLE ME TO EAT EVERY BIT OF MY PORRIDGE IN THE MORNINGS
246-122825-0025 FOR YOU OUGHT TO SEE THE SHOULDERS HE HAS BUT SOMETIMES CONCLUDED PAUL WITH A SIGH AND A MEDITATIVE AIR I REALLY THINK PORRIDGE WILL BE THE DEATH OF ME ANNE PERMITTED HERSELF A SMILE SINCE PAUL WAS NOT LOOKING AT HER
246-122825-0026 ALL AVONLEA KNEW THAT OLD MISSUS IRVING WAS BRINGING HER GRANDSON UP IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GOOD OLD FASHIONED METHODS OF DIET AND MORALS LET US HOPE NOT DEAR SHE SAID CHEERFULLY HOW ARE YOUR ROCK PEOPLE COMING ON
246-122825-0027 DOES THE OLDEST TWIN STILL CONTINUE TO BEHAVE HIMSELF HE HAS TO SAID PAUL EMPHATICALLY HE KNOWS I WON'T ASSOCIATE WITH HIM IF HE DOESN'T HE IS REALLY FULL OF WICKEDNESS I THINK AND HAS NORA FOUND OUT ABOUT THE GOLDEN LADY YET
246-122825-0028 NO BUT I THINK SHE SUSPECTS I'M ALMOST SURE SHE WATCHED ME THE LAST TIME I WENT TO THE CAVE I DON'T MIND IF SHE FINDS OUT IT IS ONLY FOR HER SAKE I DON'T WANT HER TO SO THAT HER FEELINGS WON'T BE HURT
246-122825-0029 BUT IF SHE IS DETERMINED TO HAVE HER FEELINGS HURT IT CAN'T BE HELPED IF I WERE TO GO TO THE SHORE SOME NIGHT WITH YOU DO YOU THINK I COULD SEE YOUR ROCK PEOPLE TOO PAUL SHOOK HIS HEAD GRAVELY NO I DON'T THINK YOU COULD SEE MY ROCK PEOPLE
246-122825-0030 I'M THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN SEE THEM BUT YOU COULD SEE ROCK PEOPLE OF YOUR OWN YOU'RE ONE OF THE KIND THAT CAN WE'RE BOTH THAT KIND YOU KNOW TEACHER HE ADDED SQUEEZING HER HAND CHUMMILY ISN'T IT SPLENDID TO BE THAT KIND TEACHER
246-122825-0031 SPLENDID ANNE AGREED GRAY SHINING EYES LOOKING DOWN INTO BLUE SHINING ONES ANNE AND PAUL BOTH KNEW HOW FAIR THE REALM IMAGINATION OPENS TO THE VIEW
246-122825-0032 AND BOTH KNEW THE WAY TO THAT HAPPY LAND THERE THE ROSE OF JOY BLOOMED IMMORTAL BY DALE AND STREAM CLOUDS NEVER DARKENED THE SUNNY SKY SWEET BELLS NEVER JANGLED OUT OF TUNE AND KINDRED SPIRITS ABOUNDED
246-122825-0033 THE KNOWLEDGE OF THAT LAND'S GEOGRAPHY EAST O THE SUN WEST O THE MOON IS PRICELESS LORE NOT TO BE BOUGHT IN ANY MARKET PLACE IT MUST BE THE GIFT OF THE GOOD FAIRIES AT BIRTH AND THE YEARS CAN NEVER DEFACE IT OR TAKE IT AWAY
246-122825-0034 IT IS BETTER TO POSSESS IT LIVING IN A GARRET THAN TO BE THE INHABITANT OF PALACES WITHOUT IT THE AVONLEA GRAVEYARD WAS AS YET THE GRASS GROWN SOLITUDE IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN
246-122825-0035 TO BE SURE THE IMPROVERS HAD AN EYE ON IT AND PRISCILLA GRANT HAD READ A PAPER ON CEMETERIES BEFORE THE LAST MEETING OF THE SOCIETY
246-122825-0036 AT SOME FUTURE TIME THE IMPROVERS MEANT TO HAVE THE LICHENED WAYWARD OLD BOARD FENCE REPLACED BY A NEAT WIRE RAILING THE GRASS MOWN AND THE LEANING MONUMENTS STRAIGHTENED UP
246-122825-0037 ANNE PUT ON MATTHEW'S GRAVE THE FLOWERS SHE HAD BROUGHT FOR IT AND THEN WENT OVER TO THE LITTLE POPLAR SHADED CORNER WHERE HESTER GRAY SLEPT EVER SINCE THE DAY OF THE SPRING PICNIC ANNE HAD PUT FLOWERS ON HESTER'S GRAVE WHEN SHE VISITED MATTHEW'S
246-122825-0038 THE EVENING BEFORE SHE HAD MADE A PILGRIMAGE BACK TO THE LITTLE DESERTED GARDEN IN THE WOODS AND BROUGHT THEREFROM SOME OF HESTER'S OWN WHITE ROSES I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE THEM BETTER THAN ANY OTHERS DEAR SHE SAID SOFTLY
246-122825-0039 ANNE WAS STILL SITTING THERE WHEN A SHADOW FELL OVER THE GRASS AND SHE LOOKED UP TO SEE MISSUS ALLAN THEY WALKED HOME TOGETHER MISSUS ALLAN'S FACE WAS NOT THE FACE OF THE GIRLBRIDE WHOM THE MINISTER HAD BROUGHT TO AVONLEA FIVE YEARS BEFORE
246-122825-0040 IT HAD LOST SOME OF ITS BLOOM AND YOUTHFUL CURVES AND THERE WERE FINE PATIENT LINES ABOUT EYES AND MOUTH A TINY GRAVE IN THAT VERY CEMETERY ACCOUNTED FOR SOME OF THEM AND SOME NEW ONES HAD COME DURING THE RECENT ILLNESS
246-122825-0041 NOW HAPPILY OVER OF HER LITTLE SON BUT MISSUS ALLAN'S DIMPLES WERE AS SWEET AND SUDDEN AS EVER HER EYES AS CLEAR AND BRIGHT AND TRUE AND WHAT HER FACE LACKED OF GIRLISH BEAUTY WAS NOW MORE THAN ATONED FOR IN ADDED TENDERNESS AND STRENGTH
246-122825-0042 I SUPPOSE YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR VACATION ANNE SHE SAID AS THEY LEFT THE GRAVEYARD ANNE NODDED YES I COULD ROLL THE WORD AS A SWEET MORSEL UNDER MY TONGUE I THINK THE SUMMER IS GOING TO BE LOVELY
246-122825-0043 FOR ONE THING MISSUS MORGAN IS COMING TO THE ISLAND IN JULY AND PRISCILLA IS GOING TO BRING HER UP I FEEL ONE OF MY OLD THRILLS AT THE MERE THOUGHT I HOPE YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD TIME ANNE
246-122825-0044 OH I DON'T KNOW I'VE COME SO FAR SHORT IN SO MANY THINGS I HAVEN'T DONE WHAT I MEANT TO DO WHEN I BEGAN TO TEACH LAST FALL I HAVEN'T LIVED UP TO MY IDEALS
246-122825-0045 NONE OF US EVER DO SAID MISSUS ALLAN WITH A SIGH BUT THEN ANNE YOU KNOW WHAT LOWELL SAYS NOT FAILURE BUT LOW AIM IS CRIME WE MUST HAVE IDEALS AND TRY TO LIVE UP TO THEM EVEN IF WE NEVER QUITE SUCCEED
246-122825-0046 LIFE WOULD BE A SORRY BUSINESS WITHOUT THEM WITH THEM IT'S GRAND AND GREAT HOLD FAST TO YOUR IDEALS ANNE I SHALL TRY BUT I HAVE TO LET GO MOST OF MY THEORIES SAID ANNE LAUGHING A LITTLE
246-122825-0047 I HAD THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SET OF THEORIES YOU EVER KNEW WHEN I STARTED OUT AS A SCHOOLMA'AM BUT EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS FAILED ME AT SOME PINCH OR ANOTHER EVEN THE THEORY ON CORPORAL PUNISHMENT TEASED MISSUS ALLAN BUT ANNE FLUSHED
246-122825-0048 I SHALL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF FOR WHIPPING ANTHONY NONSENSE DEAR HE DESERVED IT AND IT AGREED WITH HIM YOU HAVE HAD NO TROUBLE WITH HIM SINCE AND HE HAS COME TO THINK THERE'S NOBODY LIKE YOU
246-122825-0049 YOUR KINDNESS WON HIS LOVE AFTER THE IDEA THAT A GIRL WAS NO GOOD WAS ROOTED OUT OF HIS STUBBORN MIND HE MAY HAVE DESERVED IT BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT IF I HAD CALMLY AND DELIBERATELY DECIDED TO WHIP HIM BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT A JUST PUNISHMENT FOR HIM
246-122825-0050 I WOULD NOT FEEL OVER IT AS I DO BUT THE TRUTH IS MISSUS ALLAN THAT I JUST FLEW INTO A TEMPER AND WHIPPED HIM BECAUSE OF THAT I WASN'T THINKING WHETHER IT WAS JUST OR UNJUST EVEN IF HE HADN'T DESERVED IT I'D HAVE DONE IT JUST THE SAME
246-122825-0051 THAT IS WHAT HUMILIATES ME WELL WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES DEAR SO JUST PUT IT BEHIND YOU WE SHOULD REGRET OUR MISTAKES AND LEARN FROM THEM BUT NEVER CARRY THEM FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE WITH US THERE GOES GILBERT BLYTHE ON HIS WHEEL
246-122825-0052 HOME FOR HIS VACATION TOO I SUPPOSE HOW ARE YOU AND HE GETTING ON WITH YOUR STUDIES PRETTY WELL WE PLAN TO FINISH THE VIRGIL TONIGHT THERE ARE ONLY TWENTY LINES TO DO THEN WE ARE NOT GOING TO STUDY ANY MORE UNTIL SEPTEMBER
246-122825-0053 DO YOU THINK YOU WILL EVER GET TO COLLEGE OH I DON'T KNOW ANNE LOOKED DREAMILY AFAR TO THE OPAL TINTED HORIZON MARILLA'S EYES WILL NEVER BE MUCH BETTER THAN THEY ARE NOW ALTHOUGH WE ARE SO THANKFUL TO THINK THAT THEY WILL NOT GET
246-122825-0054 WORSE AND THEN THERE ARE THE TWINS SOMEHOW I DON'T BELIEVE THEIR UNCLE WILL EVER REALLY SEND FOR THEM PERHAPS COLLEGE MAY BE AROUND THE BEND IN THE ROAD BUT I HAVEN'T GOT TO THE BEND YET AND I DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT IT LEST I MIGHT GROW DISCONTENTED
246-122825-0055 WELL I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU GO TO COLLEGE ANNE BUT IF YOU NEVER DO DON'T BE DISCONTENTED ABOUT IT WE MAKE OUR OWN LIVES WHEREVER WE ARE AFTER ALL
246-122825-0056 THEY ARE BROAD OR NARROW ACCORDING TO WHAT WE PUT INTO THEM NOT WHAT WE GET OUT LIFE IS RICH AND FULL HERE EVERYWHERE IF WE CAN ONLY LEARN HOW TO OPEN OUR WHOLE HEARTS TO ITS RICHNESS AND FULNESS
246-122825-0057 I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN SAID ANNE THOUGHTFULLY AND I KNOW I HAVE SO MUCH TO FEEL THANKFUL FOR OH SO MUCH MY WORK AND PAUL IRVING AND THE DEAR TWINS AND ALL MY FRIENDS
246-122825-0058 DO YOU KNOW MISSUS ALLAN I'M SO THANKFUL FOR FRIENDSHIP IT BEAUTIFIES LIFE SO MUCH TRUE FRIENDSHIP IS A VERY HELPFUL THING INDEED SAID MISSUS ALLAN AND WE SHOULD HAVE A VERY HIGH IDEAL OF IT
246-122825-0059 AND NEVER SULLY IT BY ANY FAILURE IN TRUTH AND SINCERITY I FEAR THE NAME OF FRIENDSHIP IS OFTEN DEGRADED TO A KIND OF INTIMACY THAT HAS NOTHING OF REAL FRIENDSHIP IN IT YES LIKE GERTIE PYE'S AND JULIA BELL'S
246-122825-0060 THEY ARE VERY INTIMATE AND GO EVERYWHERE TOGETHER BUT GERTIE IS ALWAYS SAYING NASTY THINGS OF JULIA BEHIND HER BACK AND EVERYBODY THINKS SHE IS JEALOUS OF HER BECAUSE SHE IS ALWAYS SO PLEASED WHEN ANYBODY CRITICIZES JULIA I THINK IT IS DESECRATION TO CALL THAT FRIENDSHIP
246-122825-0061 IF WE HAVE FRIENDS WE SHOULD LOOK ONLY FOR THE BEST IN THEM AND GIVE THEM THE BEST THAT IS IN US DON'T YOU THINK THEN FRIENDSHIP WOULD BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING IN THE WORLD FRIENDSHIP IS VERY BEAUTIFUL SMILED MISSUS ALLAN BUT SOME DAY
246-122825-0062 THEN SHE PAUSED ABRUPTLY IN THE DELICATE WHITE BROWED FACE BESIDE HER WITH ITS CANDID EYES AND MOBILE FEATURES THERE WAS STILL FAR MORE OF THE CHILD THAN OF THE WOMAN
246-122825-0063 ANNE'S HEART SO FAR HARBORED ONLY DREAMS OF FRIENDSHIP AND AMBITION AND MISSUS ALLAN DID NOT WISH TO BRUSH THE BLOOM FROM HER SWEET UNCONSCIOUSNESS
