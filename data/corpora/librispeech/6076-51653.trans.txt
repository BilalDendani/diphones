6076-51653-0000 I WAS OVERCOME BY THE KINDLY SYMPATHY OF EUMOLPUS AND WAS ESPECIALLY SORRY FOR THE LATEST INJURY I HAD DONE HIM I BEGAN TO REPENT MY JEALOUSY WHICH HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF SO MANY UNPLEASANT HAPPENINGS AND WITH MANY TEARS I BEGGED AND PLED WITH HIM TO ADMIT ME INTO FAVOR
6076-51653-0001 AS LOVERS CANNOT CONTROL THEIR FURIOUS JEALOUSY AND VOWING AT THE SAME TIME THAT I WOULD NOT BY WORD OR DEED GIVE HIM CAUSE FOR OFFENSE IN THE FUTURE AND HE LIKE A LEARNED AND CULTIVATED GENTLEMAN OUGHT TO REMOVE ALL IRRITATION FROM HIS MIND
6076-51653-0002 AND LEAVE NO TRACE OF IT BEHIND THE SNOWS BELONG UPON THE GROUND IN WILD AND UNCULTIVATED REGIONS BUT WHERE THE EARTH HAS BEEN BEAUTIFIED BY THE CONQUEST OF THE PLOUGH THE LIGHT SNOW MELTS AWAY WHILE YOU SPEAK OF IT
6076-51653-0003 THAT YOU MAY EXPERIENCE THE TRUTH OF WHAT YOU SAY EXCLAIMED EUMOLPUS SEE I END MY ANGER WITH A KISS MAY GOOD LUCK GO WITH US GET YOUR BAGGAGE TOGETHER AND FOLLOW ME OR GO ON AHEAD IF YOU PREFER WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING A KNOCK SOUNDED AT THE DOOR
6076-51653-0004 GITON AND I PACK TOGETHER WHATEVER WE HAVE FOR THE VOYAGE AND AFTER PRAYING TO THE STARS WE WENT ABOARD CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDREDTH WE PICKED OUT A RETIRED SPOT ON THE POOP AND EUMOLPUS DOZED OFF AS IT WAS NOT YET DAYLIGHT
6076-51653-0005 IT IS UNFORTUNATE SAID I TO MYSELF THAT THE LAD HAS SO TAKEN OUR FRIEND'S FANCY BUT WHAT OF IT IS NOT NATURE'S EVERY MASTERPIECE COMMON TO ALL
6076-51653-0006 YET IT FLOWS FOR COMMON USE SHALL LOVE ALONE THEN BE STOLEN RATHER THAN BE REGARDED AS A PRIZE TO BE WON NO INDEED I DESIRE NO POSSESSION UNLESS THE WORLD ENVIES ME FOR POSSESSING IT A SOLITARY OLD MAN CAN SCARCELY BECOME A SERIOUS RIVAL
6076-51653-0007 EVEN SHOULD HE WISH TO TAKE ADVANTAGE HE WOULD LOSE IT THROUGH LACK OF BREATH WHEN BUT WITHOUT ANY CONFIDENCE I HAD ARRIVED AT THESE CONCLUSIONS AND BEGUILED MY UNEASY SPIRIT I COVERED MY HEAD WITH MY TUNIC AND BEGAN TO FEIGN SLEEP WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
6076-51653-0008 AS THOUGH FORTUNE WERE BENT UPON ANNIHILATING MY PEACE OF MIND A VOICE UPON THE SHIP'S DECK GRITTED OUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS SO HE FOOLED ME AFTER ALL AS THIS VOICE WHICH WAS A MAN'S AND WAS ONLY TOO FAMILIAR STRUCK MY EARS MY HEART FLUTTERED
6076-51653-0009 AS THOUGH I WERE ENVELOPED IN SOME TURBULENT NIGHTMARE WAS A LONG TIME FINDING MY VOICE BUT AT LAST WITH TREMBLING HANDS I TUGGED AT THE HEM OF EUMOLPUS CLOTHING JUST AS HE WAS SINKING INTO SLUMBER FATHER I QUAVERED ON YOUR WORD OF HONOR
6076-51653-0010 CAN YOU TELL ME WHOSE SHIP THIS IS AND WHOM SHE HAS ABOARD PEEVED AT BEING DISTURBED SO HE SNAPPED THIS WAS THE REASON YOU WISHED TO HAVE US QUARTERED IN THE MOST INACCESSIBLE SPOT ON DECK WAS IT SO WE COULD GET NO REST
6076-51653-0011 WHAT GOOD WILL IT DO YOU WHEN I'VE INFORMED YOU THAT LYCAS OF TARENTUM IS MASTER OF THIS SHIP AND THAT HE CARRIES TRYPHAENA AS AN EXILE TO TARENTUM CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIRST I SHIVERED HORROR STRUCK AT THIS THUNDERBOLT AND
6076-51653-0012 BEATING MY THROAT OH DESTINY I WAILED YOU'VE VANQUISHED ME COMPLETELY AT LAST AS FOR GITON HE FELL IN A FAINT UPON MY BOSOM AND REMAINED UNCONSCIOUS FOR QUITE A WHILE UNTIL A SWEAT FINALLY RELIEVED OUR TENSION WHEREUPON HUGGING EUMOLPUS AROUND THE KNEES
6076-51653-0013 TAKE PITY UPON THE PERISHING I BESOUGHT HIM IN THE NAME OF OUR COMMON LEARNING AID US DEATH HIMSELF HANGS OVER US AND HE WILL COME AS A RELIEF UNLESS YOU HELP US OVERWHELMED BY THIS IMPLICATION EUMOLPUS SWORE BY ALL THE GODS AND GODDESSES THAT HE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED
6076-51653-0014 BUT THAT HE HAD BROUGHT HIS COMPANIONS UPON THIS VOYAGE WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD LONG INTENDED TAKING WITH THE MOST UPRIGHT INTENTIONS AND IN THE BEST OF GOOD FAITH BUT DEMANDED HE WHAT IS THIS AMBUSH WHO IS THIS HANNIBAL WHO SAILS WITH US
6076-51653-0015 LYCAS OF TARENTUM IS A MOST RESPECTABLE CITIZEN AND THE OWNER NOT ONLY OF THIS SHIP WHICH HE COMMANDS IN PERSON BUT OF LANDED ESTATES AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL HOUSES UNDER THE MANAGEMENT OF SLAVES HE CARRIES A CARGO CONSIGNED TO MARKET HE IS THE CYCLOPS THE ARCH PIRATE TO WHOM WE OWE OUR PASSAGE
6076-51653-0016 A MOST CHARMING WOMAN TRAVELLING ABOUT HERE AND THERE IN SEARCH OF PLEASURE
6076-51653-0017 WHEREUPON HE EXPLAINED TO THE ASTONISHED EUMOLPUS THE REASONS FOR THEIR ENMITY AND FOR THE DANGER WHICH THREATENED US
6076-51653-0018 THAT HE LOST THE POWER OF THINKING AND REQUESTED EACH OF US TO OFFER HIS OWN OPINION JUST IMAGINE SAID HE
6076-51653-0019 SOME WAY OUT MUST BE FOUND UNLESS WE BRING ABOUT A SHIPWRECK AND FREE OURSELVES FROM ALL DANGERS
6076-51653-0020 AND THE PILOT MAY BE MOVED TO MERCY AND GRANT YOUR PRAYER EUMOLPUS DENIED THE PRACTICABILITY OF THIS IT IS ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY AFFIRMED HE THAT LARGE SHIPS ARE WARPED INTO LANDLOCKED HARBORS
6076-51653-0021 HOW COULD WE LEAVE THE SHIP IN SUCH A MANNER AS NOT TO BE STARED AT BY ALL THE REST WITH MUFFLED HEADS WITH BARE IF MUFFLED WHO WOULD NOT WANT TO LEND THE SICK MAN A HAND IF BARE WHAT WOULD IT MEAN IF NOT PROSCRIBING OURSELVES CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND SECOND
6076-51653-0022 WHY WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER TO TAKE REFUGE IN BOLDNESS I ASKED SLIDE DOWN A ROPE INTO THE SHIP'S BOAT CUT THE PAINTER AND LEAVE THE REST TO LUCK AND FURTHERMORE I WOULD NOT INVOLVE EUMOLPUS IN THIS ADVENTURE FOR WHAT IS THE GOOD OF GETTING AN INNOCENT MAN INTO TROUBLES WITH WHICH HE HAS NO CONCERN
6076-51653-0023 I SHALL BE WELL CONTENT IF CHANCE HELPS US INTO THE BOAT NOT A BAD SCHEME EUMOLPUS AGREED IF IT COULD ONLY BE CARRIED OUT BUT WHO COULD HELP SEEING YOU WHEN YOU START ESPECIALLY THE MAN AT THE HELM WHO STANDS WATCH ALL NIGHT LONG AND OBSERVES EVEN THE MOTIONS OF THE STARS
6076-51653-0024 BUT IT COULD BE DONE IN SPITE OF THAT WHEN HE DOZED OFF FOR A SECOND THAT IS IF YOU CHOSE SOME OTHER PART OF THE SHIP FROM WHICH TO START AS IT IS IT MUST BE THE STERN YOU MUST EVEN SLIP DOWN THE RUDDER ITSELF FOR THAT IS WHERE THE PAINTER THAT HOLDS THE BOAT IN TOW IS MADE FAST
6076-51653-0025 LYING IN THE BOAT NIGHT AND DAY YOU COULDN'T GET RID OF THAT WATCHMAN EXCEPT BY CUTTING HIS THROAT OR THROWING HIM OVERBOARD BY FORCE CONSULT YOUR OWN COURAGE AS TO WHETHER THAT CAN BE DONE OR NOT AND AS FAR AS MY COMING WITH YOU IS CONCERNED I SHIRK NO DANGER WHICH HOLDS OUT ANY HOPES OF SUCCESS
6076-51653-0026 BUT TO THROW AWAY LIFE WITHOUT A REASON AS IF IT WERE A THING OF NO MOMENT IS SOMETHING WHICH I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT EVEN YOU WOULD SANCTION SEE WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS I WILL WRAP YOU UP IN TWO HIDE BAGGAGE COVERS
6076-51653-0027 LEAVING THE ENDS SOMEWHAT OPEN OF COURSE SO YOU CAN BREATHE AND GET YOUR FOOD THEN I WILL RAISE A HUE AND CRY BECAUSE MY SLAVES HAVE THROWN THEMSELVES INTO THE SEA FEARING WORSE PUNISHMENT AND WHEN THE SHIP MAKES PORT I WILL CARRY YOU OUT AS BAGGAGE WITHOUT EXCITING THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION
6076-51653-0028 OH SO YOU WOULD BUNDLE US UP LIKE WE WERE SOLID I SNEERED OUR BELLIES WOULDN'T MAKE TROUBLE FOR US OF COURSE AND WE'LL NEVER SNEEZE NOR SNORE AND ALL BECAUSE A SIMILAR TRICK TURNED OUT SUCCESSFULLY BEFORE THINK THE MATTER OVER BEING TIED UP COULD BE ENDURED FOR ONE DAY BUT SUPPOSE IT MIGHT HAVE TO BE FOR LONGER
6076-51653-0029 WHAT COULD WE DO THEN EVEN CLOTHES WILL CUT THROUGH AT THE WRINKLES WHEN THEY ARE TIED UP TOO LONG
6076-51653-0030 COULD ENDURE THE FILTHY RAGS AND LASHINGS NECESSARY TO SUCH AN OPERATION AS STATUES DO NO THAT'S SETTLED SOME OTHER ROAD TO SAFETY MUST BE FOUND I HAVE THOUGHT UP A SCHEME SEE WHAT YOU THINK OF IT EUMOLPUS IS A MAN OF LETTERS HE WILL HAVE INK ABOUT HIM OF COURSE
6076-51653-0031 AS IF COLOR ALONE COULD CHANGE ONE'S FIGURE
6076-51653-0032 SUPPOSE THAT THE GARMENT DID NOT STICK TO THE INK AS IT OFTEN DOES WHERE NO GUM IS USED TELL ME WE CAN'T MAKE OUR LIPS SO HIDEOUSLY THICK CAN WE WE CAN'T KINK OUR HAIR WITH A CURLING IRON CAN WE WE CAN'T HARROW OUR FOREHEADS WITH SCARS CAN WE
6076-51653-0033 CAN WE TRIM OUR BEARDS AFTER THE FOREIGN STYLE NO ARTIFICIAL COLOR DIRTIES THE BODY WITHOUT CHANGING IT
6076-51653-0034 CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRD GODS AND MEN FORBID THAT YOU SHOULD MAKE SO BASE AN ENDING OF YOUR LIVES CRIED EUMOLPUS NO IT WILL BE BETTER TO DO AS I DIRECT AS YOU MAY GATHER FROM HIS RAZOR MY SERVANT IS A BARBER
6076-51653-0035 LET HIM SHAVE YOUR HEADS AND EYEBROWS TOO AND QUICKLY AT THAT I WILL FOLLOW AFTER HIM AND I WILL MARK MY INSCRIPTION SO CLEVERLY UPON YOUR FOREHEADS THAT YOU WILL BE MISTAKEN FOR SLAVES WHO HAVE BEEN BRANDED THE SAME LETTERS WILL
6076-51653-0036 SERVE BOTH TO QUIET THE SUSPICIONS OF THE CURIOUS AND TO CONCEAL UNDER SEMBLANCE OF PUNISHMENT YOUR REAL FEATURES WE DID NOT DELAY THE EXECUTION OF THIS SCHEME BUT
6076-51653-0037 THAT HE MIGHT SHAVE THEM CLEAN EUMOLPUS COVERED OUR FOREHEADS COMPLETELY WITH LARGE LETTERS AND
6076-51653-0038 HE THREW HIMSELF INTO HIS BUNK PRETENDING NOT TO HEAR HIS PUKING CURSES WE REVERTED TO OUR MELANCHOLY TRAIN OF THOUGHT AND SETTLING OURSELVES DOWN IN SILENCE WE PASSED THE REMAINING HOURS OF THE NIGHT IN FITFUL SLUMBER ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
6076-51653-0039 AFTER SOME CONVERSATION UPON THE HAPPY VOYAGE OF WHICH THE FINE WEATHER GAVE PROMISE LYCAS TURNED TO TRYPHAENA AND REMARKED CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTH PRIAPUS APPEARED TO ME IN A DREAM AND SEEMED TO SAY KNOW THAT ENCOLPIUS WHOM YOU SEEK
6076-51653-0040 HAS BY ME BEEN LED ABOARD YOUR SHIP
6076-51653-0041 DREAMS THAT DELUDE THE MIND WITH FLITTING SHADES BY NEITHER POWERS OF AIR NOR GODS ARE SENT EACH MAKES HIS OWN AND WHEN RELAXED IN SLEEP THE MEMBERS LIE THE MIND WITHOUT RESTRAINT CAN FLIT AND RE ENACT BY NIGHT THE DEEDS THAT OCCUPIED THE DAY
6076-51653-0042 THE WARRIOR FIERCE WHO CITIES SHAKES AND TOWNS DESTROYS BY FIRE MANEUVERING ARMIES SEES AND JAVELINS AND FUNERALS OF KINGS AND BLOODY FIELDS THE CRINGING LAWYER DREAMS OF COURTS AND TRIALS THE MISER HIDES HIS HOARD NEW TREASURES FINDS
6076-51653-0043 FOR THAT WAS THE NAME OF THE FELLOW WHO HAD CAUGHT US AT OUR FURTIVE TRANSFORMATION IN THE NIGHT A ROTTEN THING TO DO I SWEAR FROM WHAT I HEAR IT'S UNLAWFUL FOR ANY LIVING MAN ABOARD SHIP TO SHED HAIR OR NAILS UNLESS THE WIND HAS KICKED UP A HEAVY SEA
6076-51653-0044 CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTH LYCAS WAS GREATLY DISTURBED BY THIS INFORMATION AND FLEW INTO A RAGE SO SOMEONE ABOARD MY SHIP CUT OFF HIS HAIR DID HE HE BAWLED AND AT DEAD OF NIGHT TOO
6076-51653-0045 BRING THE OFFENDERS AFT ON DECK HERE AND STEP LIVELY SO THAT I CAN TELL WHOM TO PUNISH FROM THEIR HEADS THAT THE SHIP MAY BE FREED FROM THE CURSE I ORDERED IT DONE EUMOLPUS BROKE IN AND I DIDN'T ORDER IT AS AN UNLUCKY OMEN EITHER
6076-51653-0046 SEEING THAT I HAD TO BE ABOARD THE SAME VESSEL I DID IT BECAUSE THE SCOUNDRELS HAD LONG MATTED HAIR I ORDERED THE FILTH CLEARED OFF THE WRETCHES BECAUSE I DID NOT WISH TO EVEN SEEM TO MAKE A PRISON OUT OF YOUR SHIP BESIDES
6076-51653-0047 IN ADDITION TO THEIR OTHER MISDEMEANORS THEY BLEW IN MY MONEY ON A STREET WALKER WHOM THEY KEPT IN COMMON ONLY LAST NIGHT I DRAGGED THEM AWAY FROM HER REEKING WITH WINE AND PERFUMES AS THEY WERE
6076-51653-0048 AND THEY STILL STINK OF THE REMNANTS OF MY PATRIMONY THEREUPON FORTY STRIPES WERE ORDERED FOR EACH OF US THAT THE TUTELARY GENIUS OF THE SHIP MIGHT BE PROPITIATED AND THEY WERE NOT LONG ABOUT IT EITHER
6076-51653-0049 IT'S GITON IT'S GITON THE MAIDS ALL SCREAMED IN UNISON HOLD YOUR HANDS YOU BRUTES HELP MADAME IT'S GITON
6076-51653-0050 TURNED WILLING EARS SHE HAD RECOGNIZED THAT VOICE HERSELF AND FLEW TO THE BOY
6076-51653-0051 THAT ESTABLISHED HIS IDENTITY SINCE THIS MAN SO KEENLY OBSERVANT HAD IN SPITE OF THE MOST SKILLFUL DISGUISE OF EVERY FEATURE AND THE OBLITERATION OF EVERY IDENTIFYING MARK UPON MY BODY SO SURELY HIT UPON THE SOLE MEANS OF IDENTIFYING HIS FUGITIVE
6076-51653-0052 BELIEVING THAT THE MARKS UPON OUR FOREHEADS WERE IN TRUTH THE BRANDS OF PRISONERS
