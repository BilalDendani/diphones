225-131276-0000 THEY LUNCHED SLOWLY AND MEDITATIVELY WITH MUTE INTERVALS BETWEEN RUSHES OF TALK FOR THE SPELL ONCE BROKEN THEY HAD MUCH TO SAY AND YET MOMENTS WHEN SAYING BECAME THE MERE ACCOMPANIMENT
225-131276-0001 TO LONG DUOLOGUES OF SILENCE ARCHER KEPT THE TALK FROM HIS OWN AFFAIRS NOT WITH CONSCIOUS INTENTION BUT BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO MISS A WORD OF HER HISTORY AND LEANING ON THE TABLE
225-131276-0002 SHE TALKED TO HIM OF THE YEAR AND A HALF SINCE THEY HAD MET SHE HAD GROWN TIRED OF WHAT PEOPLE CALLED SOCIETY NEW YORK WAS KIND IT WAS ALMOST OPPRESSIVELY HOSPITABLE
225-131276-0003 AND SO SHE HAD DECIDED TO TRY WASHINGTON WHERE ONE WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET MORE VARIETIES OF PEOPLE AND OF OPINION AND ON THE WHOLE SHE SHOULD PROBABLY SETTLE DOWN IN WASHINGTON AND MAKE A HOME THERE FOR POOR MEDORA
225-131276-0004 WHO HAD WORN OUT THE PATIENCE OF ALL HER OTHER RELATIONS JUST AT THE TIME WHEN SHE MOST NEEDED LOOKING AFTER AND PROTECTING FROM MATRIMONIAL PERILS BUT DOCTOR CARVER AREN'T YOU AFRAID OF DOCTOR CARVER
225-131276-0005 I HEAR HE'S BEEN STAYING WITH YOU AT THE BLENKERS SHE SMILED OH THE CARVER DANGER IS OVER DOCTOR CARVER IS A VERY CLEVER MAN HE WANTS A RICH WIFE TO FINANCE HIS PLANS
225-131276-0006 AND MEDORA IS SIMPLY A GOOD ADVERTISEMENT AS A CONVERT A CONVERT TO WHAT TO ALL SORTS OF NEW AND CRAZY SOCIAL SCHEMES BUT DO YOU KNOW THEY INTEREST ME MORE THAN THE BLIND CONFORMITY TO TRADITION
225-131276-0007 SOMEBODY ELSE'S TRADITION THAT I SEE AMONG OUR OWN FRIENDS IT SEEMS STUPID TO HAVE DISCOVERED AMERICA ONLY TO MAKE IT INTO A COPY OF ANOTHER COUNTRY SHE SMILED ACROSS THE TABLE
225-131276-0008 AND BEAUFORT DO YOU SAY THESE THINGS TO BEAUFORT HE ASKED ABRUPTLY
225-131276-0009 BUT I USED TO AND HE UNDERSTANDS AH IT'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS TOLD YOU YOU DON'T LIKE US AND YOU LIKE BEAUFORT BECAUSE HE'S SO UNLIKE US HE LOOKED ABOUT THE BARE ROOM
225-131276-0010 AND OUT AT THE BARE BEACH AND THE ROW OF STARK WHITE VILLAGE HOUSES STRUNG ALONG THE SHORE WE'RE DAMNABLY DULL
225-131276-0011 AT LENGTH SHE SAID I BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE THE CONFESSION MORE DISPASSIONATELY
225-131276-0012 OR IN A TONE LESS ENCOURAGING TO THE VANITY OF THE PERSON ADDRESSED ARCHER REDDENED TO THE TEMPLES BUT DARED NOT MOVE OR SPEAK IT WAS AS IF HER WORDS HAD BEEN SOME RARE BUTTERFLY
225-131276-0013 SHE DREW TOGETHER HER TROUBLED BROWS BUT IT SEEMS AS IF I'D NEVER BEFORE UNDERSTOOD WITH HOW MUCH THAT IS HARD AND SHABBY AND BASE
225-131276-0014 FOR A LONG TIME I'VE HOPED THIS CHANCE WOULD COME THAT I MIGHT TELL YOU HOW YOU'VE HELPED ME WHAT YOU'VE MADE OF ME ARCHER SAT STARING BENEATH FROWNING BROWS HE INTERRUPTED HER WITH A LAUGH
225-131276-0015 I'M THE MAN WHO MARRIED ONE WOMAN BECAUSE ANOTHER ONE TOLD HIM TO HER PALENESS TURNED TO A FUGITIVE FLUSH I THOUGHT YOU PROMISED YOU WERE NOT TO SAY SUCH THINGS TODAY
225-131276-0016 AH HOW LIKE A WOMAN NONE OF YOU WILL EVER SEE A BAD BUSINESS THROUGH SHE LOWERED HER VOICE IS IT A BAD BUSINESS FOR MAY
225-131276-0017 HE STOOD IN THE WINDOW DRUMMING AGAINST THE RAISED SASH AND FEELING IN EVERY FIBRE THE WISTFUL TENDERNESS WITH WHICH SHE HAD SPOKEN HER COUSIN'S NAME
225-131276-0018 FOR THAT'S THE THING WE'VE ALWAYS GOT TO THINK OF HAVEN'T WE BY YOUR OWN SHOWING SHE INSISTED MY OWN SHOWING HE ECHOED HIS BLANK EYES STILL ON THE SEA
225-131276-0019 OR IF NOT SHE CONTINUED PURSUING HER OWN THOUGHT WITH A PAINFUL APPLICATION IF IT'S NOT WORTH WHILE TO HAVE GIVEN UP TO HAVE MISSED THINGS SO THAT OTHERS MAY BE SAVED FROM DISILLUSIONMENT AND MISERY
225-131276-0020 THEN EVERYTHING I CAME HOME FOR EVERYTHING THAT MADE MY OTHER LIFE SEEM BY CONTRAST SO BARE AND SO POOR BECAUSE NO ONE THERE TOOK ACCOUNT OF THEM ALL THESE THINGS ARE A SHAM OR A DREAM
225-131276-0021 HE TURNED AROUND WITHOUT MOVING FROM HIS PLACE AND IN THAT CASE THERE'S NO REASON ON EARTH WHY YOU SHOULDN'T GO BACK HE CONCLUDED FOR HER HER EYES WERE CLINGING TO HIM DESPERATELY
225-131276-0022 IT'S BEYOND HUMAN ENDURING THAT'S ALL OH DON'T SAY THAT WHEN I'M ENDURING IT SHE BURST OUT HER EYES FILLING HER ARMS HAD DROPPED ALONG THE TABLE AND SHE SAT WITH HER FACE ABANDONED TO HIS GAZE
225-131276-0023 OVERWHELMED BY WHAT IT SUDDENLY TOLD HIM YOU TOO OH ALL THIS TIME YOU TOO
225-131276-0024 AND NEITHER MADE ANY SHOW OF MOVING ARCHER WAS CONSCIOUS OF A CURIOUS INDIFFERENCE TO HER BODILY PRESENCE HE WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AWARE OF IT IF ONE OF THE HANDS SHE HAD FLUNG OUT ON THE TABLE HAD NOT DRAWN HIS GAZE
225-131276-0025 BUT STILL HE MADE NO EFFORT TO DRAW NEARER HE HAD KNOWN THE LOVE THAT IS FED ON CARESSES AND FEEDS THEM
225-131276-0026 BUT THIS PASSION THAT WAS CLOSER THAN HIS BONES WAS NOT TO BE SUPERFICIALLY SATISFIED HIS ONE TERROR WAS TO DO ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT EFFACE THE SOUND AND IMPRESSION OF HER WORDS HIS ONE THOUGHT
225-131276-0027 THAT HE SHOULD NEVER AGAIN FEEL QUITE ALONE BUT AFTER A MOMENT THE SENSE OF WASTE AND RUIN OVERCAME HIM THERE THEY WERE CLOSE TOGETHER AND SAFE AND SHUT IN
225-131276-0028 YET SO CHAINED TO THEIR SEPARATE DESTINIES THAT THEY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN HALF THE WORLD APART
225-131276-0029 CRYING OUT TO HER BENEATH HIS WORDS SHE SAT MOTIONLESS WITH LOWERED LIDS OH I SHAN'T GO YET NOT YET
225-131276-0030 SOME TIME THEN SOME TIME THAT YOU ALREADY FORESEE
225-131276-0031 I PROMISE YOU NOT AS LONG AS YOU HOLD OUT
225-131276-0032 HE DROPPED INTO HIS CHAIR WHAT HER ANSWER REALLY SAID WAS IF YOU LIFT A FINGER YOU'LL DRIVE ME BACK BACK TO ALL THE ABOMINATIONS YOU KNOW OF AND ALL THE TEMPTATIONS YOU HALF GUESS
225-131276-0033 HE UNDERSTOOD IT AS CLEARLY AS IF SHE HAD UTTERED THE WORDS AND THE THOUGHT KEPT HIM ANCHORED TO HIS SIDE OF THE TABLE IN A KIND OF MOVED AND SACRED SUBMISSION WHAT A LIFE FOR YOU HE GROANED
225-131276-0034 AND MINE A PART OF YOURS SHE NODDED AND THAT'S TO BE ALL FOR EITHER OF US WELL IT IS ALL ISN'T IT
225-131276-0035 AT THAT HE SPRANG UP FORGETTING EVERYTHING BUT THE SWEETNESS OF HER FACE SHE ROSE TOO NOT AS IF TO MEET HIM OR TO FLEE FROM HIM BUT QUIETLY
225-131276-0036 NOT AS A CHECK BUT AS A GUIDE TO HIM THEY FELL INTO HIS WHILE HER ARMS EXTENDED BUT NOT RIGID KEPT HIM FAR ENOUGH OFF TO LET HER SURRENDERED FACE SAY THE REST THEY MAY HAVE STOOD IN THAT WAY FOR A LONG TIME
225-131276-0037 OR ONLY FOR A FEW MOMENTS BUT IT WAS LONG ENOUGH FOR HER SILENCE TO COMMUNICATE ALL SHE HAD TO SAY AND FOR HIM TO FEEL THAT ONLY ONE THING MATTERED HE MUST DO NOTHING
225-131276-0038 TO MAKE THIS MEETING THEIR LAST HE MUST LEAVE THEIR FUTURE IN HER CARE ASKING ONLY THAT SHE SHOULD KEEP FAST HOLD OF IT DON'T DON'T BE UNHAPPY
225-131276-0039 I WON'T GO BACK SHE SAID AND TURNING AWAY SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND LED THE WAY INTO THE PUBLIC DINING ROOM THE STRIDENT SCHOOL TEACHERS
225-131276-0040 WERE GATHERING UP THEIR POSSESSIONS PREPARATORY TO A STRAGGLING FLIGHT TO THE WHARF ACROSS THE BEACH LAY THE WHITE STEAM BOAT AT THE PIER AND OVER THE SUNLIT WATERS BOSTON LOOMED
