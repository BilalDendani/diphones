128-121911-0000 THEN SAID SHE THIS DEBATE ABOUT PROVIDENCE IS AN OLD ONE AND IS VIGOROUSLY DISCUSSED BY CICERO IN HIS DIVINATION THOU ALSO HAST LONG AND EARNESTLY PONDERED THE PROBLEM
128-121911-0001 YET NO ONE HAS HAD DILIGENCE AND PERSEVERANCE ENOUGH TO FIND A SOLUTION AND THE REASON OF THIS OBSCURITY IS THAT THE MOVEMENT OF HUMAN REASONING CANNOT COPE
128-121911-0002 NO SHADOW OF UNCERTAINTY WOULD REMAIN WITH A VIEW OF MAKING THIS AT LAST CLEAR AND PLAIN I WILL BEGIN BY CONSIDERING THE ARGUMENTS BY WHICH THOU ART SWAYED FIRST
128-121911-0003 I INQUIRE INTO THE REASONS WHY THOU ART DISSATISFIED WITH THE SOLUTION PROPOSED WHICH IS TO THE EFFECT THAT
128-121911-0004 FOREKNOWLEDGE IS NOT TO BE DEEMED ANY HINDRANCE TO THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL NOW SURELY THE SOLE GROUND ON WHICH THOU ARGUEST THE NECESSITY OF THE FUTURE IS THAT THINGS WHICH ARE FOREKNOWN CANNOT FAIL TO COME TO PASS BUT IF
128-121911-0005 AS THOU WERT READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE JUST NOW THE FACT OF FOREKNOWLEDGE IMPOSES NO NECESSITY ON THINGS FUTURE WHAT REASON IS THERE FOR SUPPOSING THE RESULTS OF VOLUNTARY ACTION CONSTRAINED TO A FIXED ISSUE SUPPOSE FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT
128-121911-0006 AND TO SEE WHAT FOLLOWS WE ASSUME THAT THERE IS NO FOREKNOWLEDGE ARE WILLED ACTIONS THEN TIED DOWN TO ANY NECESSITY IN THIS CASE CERTAINLY NOT
128-121911-0007 LET US ASSUME FOREKNOWLEDGE AGAIN BUT WITHOUT ITS INVOLVING ANY ACTUAL NECESSITY THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL I IMAGINE WILL REMAIN IN COMPLETE INTEGRITY BUT
128-121911-0008 GRANTED BUT IN THIS CASE IT IS PLAIN THAT EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN NO FOREKNOWLEDGE
128-121911-0009 FOR A SIGN ONLY INDICATES SOMETHING WHICH IS DOES NOT BRING TO PASS THAT OF WHICH IT IS THE SIGN WE REQUIRE TO SHOW BEFOREHAND THAT ALL THINGS WITHOUT EXCEPTION HAPPEN OF NECESSITY
128-121911-0010 OTHERWISE IF THERE IS NO SUCH UNIVERSAL NECESSITY NEITHER CAN ANY PRECONCEPTION BE A SIGN OF A NECESSITY WHICH EXISTS NOT
128-121911-0011 MUST BE DRAWN NOT FROM SIGNS AND LOOSE GENERAL ARGUMENTS BUT FROM SUITABLE AND NECESSARY CAUSES BUT HOW CAN IT BE THAT THINGS FORESEEN SHOULD EVER FAIL TO COME TO PASS
128-121911-0012 WERE NOT ABOUT TO HAPPEN INSTEAD OF OUR SUPPOSING THAT ALTHOUGH THEY SHOULD COME TO PASS YET THERE WAS NO NECESSITY INVOLVED IN THEIR OWN NATURE COMPELLING THEIR OCCURRENCE
128-121911-0013 THERE ARE MANY THINGS WHICH WE SEE TAKING PLACE BEFORE OUR EYES THE MOVEMENTS OF CHARIOTEERS FOR INSTANCE IN GUIDING AND TURNING THEIR CARS AND SO ON NOW IS ANY ONE OF THESE MOVEMENTS COMPELLED BY ANY NECESSITY NO CERTAINLY NOT
128-121911-0014 THERE WOULD BE NO EFFICACY IN SKILL IF ALL MOTIONS TOOK PLACE PERFORCE THEN THINGS WHICH IN TAKING PLACE ARE FREE FROM ANY NECESSITY AS TO THEIR BEING IN THE PRESENT MUST ALSO BEFORE THEY TAKE PLACE BE ABOUT TO HAPPEN WITHOUT NECESSITY
128-121911-0015 WHEREFORE THERE ARE THINGS WHICH WILL COME TO PASS THE OCCURRENCE OF WHICH IS PERFECTLY FREE FROM NECESSITY AT ALL EVENTS I IMAGINE THAT NO ONE WILL DENY THAT THINGS NOW TAKING PLACE WERE ABOUT TO COME TO PASS BEFORE THEY WERE ACTUALLY HAPPENING
128-121911-0016 SUCH THINGS HOWEVER MUCH FOREKNOWN ARE IN THEIR OCCURRENCE FREE
128-121911-0017 BUT THIS THOU WILT SAY IS THE VERY POINT IN DISPUTE WHETHER ANY FOREKNOWING IS POSSIBLE OF THINGS WHOSE OCCURRENCE IS NOT NECESSARY FOR HERE THERE SEEMS TO THEE A CONTRADICTION AND IF THEY ARE FORESEEN THEIR NECESSITY FOLLOWS
128-121911-0018 WHEREAS IF THERE IS NO NECESSITY THEY CAN BY NO MEANS BE FOREKNOWN AND THOU THINKEST THAT NOTHING CAN BE GRASPED AS KNOWN UNLESS IT IS CERTAIN BUT IF THINGS WHOSE OCCURRENCE IS UNCERTAIN ARE FOREKNOWN AS CERTAIN
128-121911-0019 THIS IS THE VERY MIST OF OPINION NOT THE TRUTH OF KNOWLEDGE
128-121911-0020 THOU BELIEVEST TO BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SOUNDNESS OF KNOWLEDGE NOW THE CAUSE OF THE MISTAKE IS THIS THAT MEN THINK THAT ALL KNOWLEDGE IS COGNIZED PURELY BY THE NATURE AND EFFICACY OF THE THING KNOWN
128-121911-0021 WHEREAS THE CASE IS THE VERY REVERSE ALL THAT IS KNOWN IS GRASPED NOT CONFORMABLY TO ITS OWN EFFICACY BUT RATHER CONFORMABLY TO THE FACULTY OF THE KNOWER
128-121911-0022 THE ROUNDNESS OF A BODY IS RECOGNISED IN ONE WAY BY SIGHT IN ANOTHER BY TOUCH SIGHT LOOKS UPON IT FROM A DISTANCE AS A WHOLE BY A SIMULTANEOUS REFLECTION OF RAYS TOUCH GRASPS THE ROUNDNESS PIECEMEAL
128-121911-0023 BY CONTACT AND ATTACHMENT TO THE SURFACE AND BY ACTUAL MOVEMENT ROUND THE PERIPHERY ITSELF MAN HIMSELF LIKEWISE IS VIEWED IN ONE WAY BY SENSE IN ANOTHER BY IMAGINATION IN ANOTHER WAY AGAIN BY THOUGHT
128-121911-0024 IN ANOTHER BY PURE INTELLIGENCE SENSE JUDGES FIGURE CLOTHED IN MATERIAL SUBSTANCE IMAGINATION FIGURE ALONE WITHOUT MATTER THOUGHT TRANSCENDS THIS AGAIN
128-121911-0025 THE EYE OF INTELLIGENCE IS YET MORE EXALTED
128-121911-0026 BY THE PURE FORCE OF THE MIND'S VISION WHEREIN THE MAIN POINT TO BE CONSIDERED IS THIS THE HIGHER FACULTY OF COMPREHENSION EMBRACES THE LOWER WHILE THE LOWER CANNOT RISE TO THE HIGHER FOR SENSE HAS NO EFFICACY BEYOND MATTER
128-121911-0027 NOR CAN IMAGINATION BEHOLD UNIVERSAL IDEAS NOR THOUGHT EMBRACE PURE FORM BUT INTELLIGENCE LOOKING DOWN AS IT WERE FROM ITS HIGHER STANDPOINT IN ITS INTUITION OF FORM DISCRIMINATES ALSO THE SEVERAL ELEMENTS WHICH UNDERLIE IT
128-121911-0028 BUT IT COMPREHENDS THEM IN THE SAME WAY AS IT COMPREHENDS THAT FORM ITSELF WHICH COULD BE COGNIZED BY NO OTHER THAN ITSELF
128-121911-0029 BUT SURVEYING ALL THINGS SO TO SPEAK UNDER THE ASPECT OF PURE FORM BY A SINGLE FLASH OF INTUITION THOUGHT ALSO
128-121911-0030 EMBRACES IMAGES AND SENSE IMPRESSIONS WITHOUT RESORTING TO IMAGINATION OR SENSE
128-121911-0031 MAN IS A TWO LEGGED ANIMAL ENDOWED WITH REASON THIS IS INDEED A UNIVERSAL NOTION YET NO ONE IS IGNORANT THAT THE THING IS IMAGINABLE AND PRESENTABLE TO SENSE BECAUSE THOUGHT CONSIDERS IT NOT BY IMAGINATION OR SENSE
128-121911-0032 BUT BY MEANS OF RATIONAL CONCEPTION
128-121911-0033 IS FOUNDED UPON THE SENSES NEVERTHELESS SURVEYS SENSE IMPRESSIONS WITHOUT CALLING IN SENSE NOT IN THE WAY OF SENSE PERCEPTION BUT OF IMAGINATION
128-121911-0034 THAN THE FACULTY OF THE THINGS WHICH THEY COGNIZE NOR IS THIS STRANGE FOR SINCE EVERY JUDGMENT IS THE ACT OF THE JUDGE IT IS NECESSARY THAT EACH SHOULD ACCOMPLISH ITS TASK BY ITS OWN NOT BY ANOTHER'S POWER
128-121911-0035 COMES A DOCTRINE SAGE THAT DOTH LIKEN LIVING MIND TO A WRITTEN PAGE SINCE ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES THROUGH SENSE GRAVEN BY EXPERIENCE AS SAY THEY THE PEN ITS MARKS CURIOUSLY DOTH TRACE
128-121911-0036 ON THE SMOOTH UNSULLIED WHITE OF THE PAPER'S FACE SO DO OUTER THINGS IMPRESS IMAGES ON CONSCIOUSNESS BUT IF VERILY THE MIND THUS ALL PASSIVE LIES IF NO LIVING POWER WITHIN ITS OWN FORCE SUPPLIES
128-121911-0037 IF IT BUT REFLECT AGAIN LIKE A GLASS THINGS FALSE AND VAIN
128-121911-0038 GRASPS EACH WHOLE THAT SENSE PRESENTS OR BREAKS INTO ELEMENTS SO DIVIDES AND RECOMBINES AND IN CHANGEFUL WISE NOW TO LOW DESCENDS AND NOW TO THE HEIGHT DOTH RISE
128-121911-0039 LAST IN INWARD SWIFT REVIEW STRICTLY SIFTS THE FALSE AND TRUE OF THESE AMPLE POTENCIES FITTER CAUSE I WEEN WERE MIND'S SELF THAN MARKS IMPRESSED BY THE OUTER SCENE YET THE BODY THROUGH THE SENSE
128-121911-0040 STIRS THE SOUL'S INTELLIGENCE WHEN LIGHT FLASHES ON THE EYE OR SOUND STRIKES THE EAR MIND AROUSED TO DUE RESPONSE MAKES THE MESSAGE CLEAR
