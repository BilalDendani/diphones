4189-115680-0000 ELSEWHERE I HAVE SET DOWN FOR WHATEVER INTEREST THEY HAVE IN THIS THE TWENTY FIFTH CENTURY MY PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY NOW IT OCCURS TO ME THAT MY MEMOIRS OF THE TWENTY FIFTH CENTURY MAY HAVE AN EQUAL INTEREST FIVE HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW
4189-115680-0001 PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THAT UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE FROM WHICH I HAVE SEEN THE TWENTY FIFTH CENTURY ENTERING IT AS I DID IN ONE LEAP ACROSS A GAP OF FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO YEARS THIS STATEMENT REQUIRES ELUCIDATION
4189-115680-0002 THERE ARE STILL MANY IN THE WORLD WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH MY UNIQUE EXPERIENCE FIVE CENTURIES FROM NOW THERE MAY BE MANY MORE ESPECIALLY IF CIVILIZATION IS FATED TO ENDURE ANY WORSE CONVULSIONS THAN THOSE WHICH HAVE OCCURRED BETWEEN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE A D AND THE PRESENT TIME
4189-115680-0003 I SHOULD STATE THEREFORE THAT I ANTHONY ROGERS AM SO FAR AS I KNOW THE ONLY MAN ALIVE WHOSE NORMAL SPAN OF EIGHTY ONE YEARS OF LIFE
4189-115680-0004 TO BE PRECISE I LIVED THE FIRST TWENTY NINE YEARS OF MY LIFE BETWEEN EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT AND NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN THE OTHER FIFTY TWO SINCE TWENTY FOUR NINETEEN THE GAP BETWEEN THESE TWO A PERIOD OF NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED YEARS
4189-115680-0005 I SPENT IN A STATE OF SUSPENDED ANIMATION FREE FROM THE RAVAGES OF KATABOLIC PROCESSES
4189-115680-0006 WHEN I BEGAN MY LONG SLEEP MAN HAD JUST BEGUN HIS REAL CONQUEST OF THE AIR IN A SUDDEN SERIES OF TRANSOCEANIC FLIGHTS IN AIRPLANES DRIVEN BY INTERNAL COMBUSTION MOTORS HE HAD BARELY BEGUN TO SPECULATE ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF HARNESSING SUB ATOMIC FORCES
4189-115680-0007 AND HAD MADE NO FURTHER PRACTICAL PENETRATION INTO THE FIELD OF ETHEREAL PULSATIONS THAN THE PRIMITIVE RADIO AND TELEVISION OF THAT DAY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WAS THE MOST POWERFUL NATION IN THE WORLD
4189-115680-0008 ITS POLITICAL FINANCIAL INDUSTRIAL AND SCIENTIFIC INFLUENCE BEING SUPREME AND IN THE ARTS ALSO IT WAS RAPIDLY CLIMBING INTO LEADERSHIP I AWOKE TO FIND THE AMERICA I KNEW A TOTAL WRECK TO FIND AMERICANS A HUNTED RACE IN THEIR OWN LAND
4189-115680-0009 HIDING IN THE DENSE FORESTS THAT COVERED THE SHATTERED AND LEVELED RUINS OF THEIR ONCE MAGNIFICENT CITIES DESPERATELY PRESERVING AND STRUGGLING TO DEVELOP IN THEIR SECRET RETREATS THE REMNANTS OF THEIR CULTURE AND SCIENCE AND THE UNDYING FLAME OF THEIR STURDY INDEPENDENCE
4189-115680-0010 WORLD DOMINATION WAS IN THE HANDS OF MONGOLIANS AND THE CENTER OF WORLD POWER LAY IN INLAND CHINA WITH AMERICANS ONE OF THE FEW RACES OF MANKIND UNSUBDUED AND IT MUST BE ADMITTED IN FAIRNESS TO THE TRUTH
4189-115680-0011 FOR THEY NEEDED NOT THE FORESTS IN WHICH THE AMERICANS LIVED NOR THE RESOURCES OF THE VAST TERRITORIES THESE FORESTS COVERED WITH THE PERFECTION TO WHICH THEY HAD REDUCED THE SYNTHETIC PRODUCTION OF NECESSITIES AND LUXURIES
4189-115680-0012 THEIR REMARKABLE DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENTIFIC PROCESSES AND MECHANICAL ACCOMPLISHMENT OF WORK THEY HAD NO ECONOMIC NEED FOR THE FORESTS AND NO ECONOMIC DESIRE FOR THE ENSLAVED LABOR OF AN UNRULY RACE
4189-115680-0013 THEY HAD ALL THEY NEEDED FOR THEIR MAGNIFICENTLY LUXURIOUS AND DEGRADED SCHEME OF CIVILIZATION WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE FIFTEEN CITIES OF SPARKLING GLASS THEY HAD FLUNG SKYWARD ON THE SITES OF ANCIENT AMERICAN CENTERS INTO THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH UNDERNEATH THEM
4189-115680-0014 AND WITH RELATIVELY SMALL SURROUNDING AREAS OF AGRICULTURE COMPLETE DOMINATION OF THE AIR RENDERED COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THESE CENTERS A MATTER OF EASE AND SAFETY OCCASIONAL DESTRUCTIVE RAIDS ON THE WASTE LANDS WERE CONSIDERED ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY TO KEEP THE WILD AMERICANS ON THE RUN
4189-115680-0015 WITHIN THE SHELTER OF THEIR FORESTS AND PREVENT THEIR BECOMING A MENACE TO THE HAN CIVILIZATION BUT NEARLY THREE HUNDRED YEARS OF EASILY MAINTAINED SECURITY THE LAST CENTURY OF WHICH HAD BEEN NEARLY STERILE IN SCIENTIFIC SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROGRESS
4189-115680-0016 HAD SOFTENED AND DEVITALIZED THE HANS IT HAD LIKEWISE DEVELOPED BENEATH THE PROTECTING FOLIAGE OF THE FOREST THE GROWTH OF A VIGOROUS NEW AMERICAN CIVILIZATION
4189-115680-0017 I BEGAN THE EXPLORATION OF A DESERTED WORKING IN A MOUNTAINOUS DISTRICT WHERE SEVERAL WEEKS BEFORE A NUMBER OF MINING ENGINEERS HAD REPORTED TRACES OF CARNOTITE
4189-115680-0018 WE NOTICED TOO THAT THE ROCK IN THE SIDE WALLS OF THE SHAFT WAS SOFT EVIDENTLY DUE TO THE RADIOACTIVITY AND PIECES CRUMBLED UNDER FOOT RATHER EASILY WE MADE OUR WAY CAUTIOUSLY DOWN THE SHAFT WHEN SUDDENLY THE ROTTED TIMBERS ABOVE US GAVE WAY
4189-115680-0019 I JUMPED AHEAD BARELY ESCAPING THE AVALANCHE OF COAL AND SOFT ROCK BUT MY COMPANIONS WHO WERE SEVERAL PACES BEHIND ME WERE BURIED UNDER IT AND UNDOUBTEDLY MET INSTANT DEATH I WAS TRAPPED RETURN WAS IMPOSSIBLE
4189-115680-0020 WITH MY ELECTRIC TORCH I EXPLORED THE SHAFT TO ITS END BUT COULD FIND NO OTHER WAY OUT THE AIR BECAME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO BREATHE
4189-115680-0021 IN A LITTLE WHILE MY SENSES REELED AND I LOST CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN I AWOKE THERE WAS A COOL AND REFRESHING CIRCULATION OF AIR IN THE SHAFT I HAD NO THOUGHT THAT I HAD BEEN UNCONSCIOUS MORE THAN A FEW HOURS
4189-115680-0022 MY AWAKENING I FIGURED OUT LATER HAD BEEN DUE TO SOME SHIFTING OF THE STRATA WHICH REOPENED THE SHAFT AND CLEARED THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE WORKING
4189-115680-0023 WHERE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WORLD OVERGROWN WITH A VAST FOREST AND NO VISIBLE SIGN OF HUMAN HABITATION MET MY EYES I SHALL PASS OVER THE DAYS OF MENTAL AGONY THAT FOLLOWED IN MY ATTEMPT TO GRASP THE MEANING OF IT ALL
4189-115680-0024 THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I FELT THAT I WAS ON THE VERGE OF INSANITY I ROAMED THE UNFAMILIAR FOREST LIKE A LOST SOUL HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE NECESSITY OF IMPROVISING TRAPS AND CRUDE CLUBS WITH WHICH TO SLAY MY FOOD I BELIEVE I SHOULD HAVE GONE MAD
4189-115680-0025 SUFFICE IT TO SAY HOWEVER THAT I SURVIVED THIS PSYCHIC CRISIS
