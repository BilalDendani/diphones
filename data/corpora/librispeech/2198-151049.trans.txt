2198-151049-0000 CHAPTER THREE HOW HORDLE JOHN COZENED THE FULLER OF LYMINGTON IT IS NOT HOWEVER IN THE NATURE OF THINGS THAT A LAD OF TWENTY
2198-151049-0001 AND ALL THE WIDE WORLD BEFORE HIM SHOULD SPEND HIS FIRST HOURS OF FREEDOM IN MOURNING FOR WHAT HE HAD LEFT
2198-151049-0002 HE WAS STRIDING STURDILY ALONG SWINGING HIS STAFF AND WHISTLING AS MERRILY AS THE BIRDS IN THE THICKET IT WAS AN EVENING TO RAISE A MAN'S HEART THE SUN SHINING SLANTWISE THROUGH THE TREES THREW DELICATE TRACERIES ACROSS THE ROAD WITH BARS OF GOLDEN LIGHT BETWEEN
2198-151049-0003 AWAY IN THE DISTANCE BEFORE AND BEHIND THE GREEN BOUGHS NOW TURNING IN PLACES TO A COPPERY REDNESS SHOT THEIR BROAD ARCHES ACROSS THE TRACK THE STILL SUMMER AIR WAS HEAVY WITH THE RESINOUS SMELL OF THE GREAT FOREST HERE AND THERE
2198-151049-0004 A TAWNY BROOK PRATTLED OUT FROM AMONG THE UNDERWOOD AND LOST ITSELF AGAIN IN THE FERNS AND BRAMBLES UPON THE FURTHER SIDE SAVE THE DULL PIPING OF INSECTS AND THE SOUGH OF THE LEAVES THERE WAS SILENCE EVERYWHERE THE SWEET RESTFUL SILENCE OF NATURE
2198-151049-0005 AND YET THERE WAS NO WANT OF LIFE THE WHOLE WIDE WOOD WAS FULL OF IT NOW IT WAS A LITHE FURTIVE STOAT WHICH SHOT ACROSS THE PATH UPON SOME FELL ERRAND OF ITS OWN THEN IT WAS A WILD CAT
2198-151049-0006 WHICH SQUATTED UPON THE OUTLYING BRANCH OF AN OAK AND PEEPED AT THE TRAVELLER WITH A YELLOW AND DUBIOUS EYE ONCE IT WAS A WILD SOW WHICH SCUTTLED OUT OF THE BRACKEN WITH TWO YOUNG SOUNDERS AT HER HEELS AND ONCE
2198-151049-0007 AND LOOKED AROUND HIM WITH THE FEARLESS GAZE OF ONE WHO LIVED UNDER THE KING'S OWN HIGH PROTECTION ALLEYNE GAVE HIS STAFF A MERRY FLOURISH HOWEVER AND THE RED DEER BETHOUGHT HIM THAT THE KING WAS FAR OFF SO STREAKED AWAY FROM WHENCE HE CAME
2198-151049-0008 THE YOUTH HAD NOW JOURNEYED CONSIDERABLY BEYOND THE FURTHEST DOMAINS OF THE ABBEY HE WAS THE MORE SURPRISED THEREFORE WHEN ON COMING ROUND A TURN IN THE PATH HE PERCEIVED A MAN CLAD IN THE FAMILIAR GARB OF THE ORDER
2198-151049-0009 AND SEATED IN A CLUMP OF HEATHER BY THE ROADSIDE ALLEYNE HAD KNOWN EVERY BROTHER WELL BUT THIS WAS A FACE WHICH WAS NEW TO HIM A FACE
2198-151049-0010 WORKING THIS WAY AND THAT AS THOUGH THE MAN WERE SORE PERPLEXED IN HIS MIND ONCE HE SHOOK BOTH HANDS FURIOUSLY IN THE AIR AND TWICE HE SPRANG FROM HIS SEAT AND HURRIED DOWN THE ROAD WHEN HE ROSE HOWEVER ALLEYNE OBSERVED THAT HIS ROBE
2198-151049-0011 WAS MUCH TOO LONG AND LOOSE FOR HIM IN EVERY DIRECTION TRAILING UPON THE GROUND AND BAGGING ABOUT HIS ANKLES SO THAT EVEN WITH TRUSSED UP SKIRTS HE COULD MAKE LITTLE PROGRESS HE RAN ONCE BUT
2198-151049-0012 AND FINALLY PLUMPED INTO THE HEATHER ONCE MORE YOUNG FRIEND SAID HE WHEN ALLEYNE WAS ABREAST OF HIM
2198-151049-0013 THE CLERK ANSWERED FOR I HAVE SPENT ALL MY DAYS WITHIN ITS WALLS
2198-151049-0014 THEN PERHAPS CANST TELL ME THE NAME OF A GREAT LOATHLY LUMP OF A BROTHER WI FRECKLED FACE AN A HAND LIKE A SPADE HIS EYES WERE BLACK AN HIS HAIR WAS RED AN HIS

2198-151049-0016 AND HATH LEFT ME HERE IN THIS SORRY FROCK OF WHITE FALDING SO THAT I HAVE SHAME TO GO BACK TO MY WIFE LEST SHE THINK THAT I HAVE DONNED HER OLD KIRTLE HARROW AND ALAS
2198-151049-0017 ASKED THE YOUNG CLERK WHO COULD SCARCE KEEP FROM LAUGHTER AT THE SIGHT
2198-151049-0018 SITTING DOWN ONCE MORE I WAS PASSING THIS WAY HOPING TO REACH LYMINGTON ERE NIGHTFALL WHEN I CAME ON THIS RED HEADED KNAVE SEATED
2198-151049-0019 I UNCOVERED AND LOUTED AS I PASSED THINKING THAT HE MIGHT BE A HOLY MAN AT HIS ORISONS BUT HE CALLED TO ME AND ASKED ME IF I HAD HEARD SPEAK OF THE NEW INDULGENCE IN FAVOR OF THE CISTERCIANS NOT I I ANSWERED
2198-151049-0020 THEN THE WORSE FOR THY SOUL SAID HE AND WITH THAT HE BROKE INTO A LONG TALE HOW THAT ON ACCOUNT OF THE VIRTUES OF THE ABBOT BERGHERSH IT HAD BEEN DECREED BY THE POPE
2198-151049-0021 FOR AS LONG AS HE MIGHT SAY THE SEVEN PSALMS OF DAVID SHOULD BE ASSURED OF THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN WHEN I HEARD THIS I PRAYED HIM ON MY KNEES THAT HE WOULD GIVE ME THE USE OF HIS GOWN WHICH AFTER MANY CONTENTIONS HE AT LAST AGREED TO DO
2198-151049-0022 ON MY PAYING HIM THREE MARKS TOWARDS THE REGILDING OF THE IMAGE OF LAURENCE THE MARTYR HAVING STRIPPED HIS ROBE I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO LET HIM HAVE THE WEARING OF MY GOOD LEATHERN JERKIN AND HOSE FOR AS HE SAID IT WAS CHILLING TO THE BLOOD
2198-151049-0023 AND UNSEEMLY TO THE EYE TO STAND FROCKLESS

2198-151049-0030 YOU WILL THEN SEE UNDER A GREAT BEECH TREE THE HUT OF A CHARCOAL BURNER GIVE HIM MY NAME GOOD SIR THE NAME OF PETER THE FULLER OF LYMINGTON AND ASK HIM FOR A CHANGE OF RAIMENT THAT I MAY PURSUE MY JOURNEY WITHOUT DELAY
2198-151049-0031 THERE ARE REASONS WHY HE WOULD BE LOTH TO REFUSE ME ALLEYNE STARTED OFF ALONG THE PATH INDICATED AND SOON FOUND THE LOG HUT WHERE THE BURNER DWELT HE WAS AWAY FAGGOT CUTTING IN THE FOREST BUT HIS WIFE A RUDDY BUSTLING DAME
2198-151049-0032 FOUND THE NEEDFUL GARMENTS AND TIED THEM INTO A BUNDLE WHILE SHE BUSIED HERSELF IN FINDING AND FOLDING THEM ALLEYNE EDRICSON STOOD BY THE OPEN DOOR LOOKING IN AT HER WITH MUCH INTEREST AND SOME DISTRUST
2198-151049-0033 FOR HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO NIGH TO A WOMAN BEFORE SHE HAD ROUND RED ARMS A DRESS OF SOME SOBER WOOLLEN STUFF AND A BRASS BROOCH THE SIZE OF A CHEESE CAKE STUCK IN THE FRONT OF IT PETER THE FULLER
2198-151049-0034 SHE KEPT REPEATING MARRY COME UP IF I WERE PETER THE FULLER'S WIFE I WOULD TEACH HIM BETTER THAN TO GIVE HIS CLOTHES TO THE FIRST KNAVE WHO ASKS FOR THEM BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A POOR FOND SILLY CREATURE WAS PETER
2198-151049-0035 FOR HELPING TO BURY OUR SECOND SON WAT
2198-151049-0036 BUT WHO ARE YOU YOUNG SIR

2198-151049-0040 IT WERE EASY TO SEE THAT THERE IS NO WOMAN TO TEND TO THEE SO
2198-151049-0041 NOW BUSS ME BOY ALLEYNE STOOPED AND KISSED HER FOR THE KISS WAS THE COMMON SALUTATION OF THE AGE AND AS ERASMUS LONG AFTERWARDS REMARKED MORE USED IN ENGLAND THAN IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY
2198-151049-0042 YET IT SENT THE BLOOD TO HIS TEMPLES AGAIN AND HE WONDERED AS HE TURNED AWAY WHAT THE ABBOT BERGHERSH WOULD HAVE ANSWERED TO SO FRANK AN INVITATION HE WAS STILL TINGLING FROM THIS NEW EXPERIENCE WHEN HE CAME OUT UPON THE HIGH ROAD
2198-151049-0043 AND SAW A SIGHT WHICH DROVE ALL OTHER THOUGHTS FROM HIS MIND SOME WAY DOWN FROM WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIM THE UNFORTUNATE PETER WAS STAMPING AND RAVING TENFOLD WORSE THAN BEFORE NOW HOWEVER
2198-151049-0044 INSTEAD OF THE GREAT WHITE CLOAK HE HAD NO CLOTHES ON AT ALL SAVE A SHORT WOOLLEN SHIRT AND A PAIR OF LEATHER SHOES FAR DOWN THE ROAD A LONG LEGGED FIGURE WAS RUNNING WITH A BUNDLE UNDER ONE ARM AND THE OTHER HAND TO HIS SIDE
2198-151049-0045 LIKE A MAN WHO LAUGHS UNTIL HE IS SORE SEE HIM YELLED PETER LOOK TO HIM
2198-151049-0046 HE SHALL SEE WINCHESTER JAIL FOR THIS SEE WHERE HE GOES WITH MY CLOAK UNDER HIS ARM WHO THEN CRIED ALLEYNE WHO BUT THAT CURSED BROTHER JOHN HE HATH NOT LEFT ME CLOTHES ENOUGH TO MAKE A GALLYBAGGER THE DOUBLE THIEF HATH COZENED ME OUT OF MY GOWN
2198-151049-0047 IT WAS HIS GOWN OBJECTED ALLEYNE IT BOOTS NOT HE HATH THEM ALL GOWN JERKIN HOSEN AND ALL GRAMERCY TO HIM THAT HE LEFT ME THE SHIRT AND THE SHOON
2198-151049-0048 BUT HOW CAME THIS ASKED ALLEYNE OPEN EYED WITH ASTONISHMENT ARE THOSE THE CLOTHES FOR DEAR CHARITY'S SAKE GIVE THEM TO ME NOT THE POPE HIMSELF SHALL HAVE THESE FROM ME THOUGH HE SENT THE WHOLE COLLEGE OF CARDINALS TO ASK IT HOW CAME IT WHY
2198-151049-0049 AND WHEN I OPED MOUTH TO REPROACH HIM HE ASKED ME WHETHER IT WAS INDEED LIKELY THAT A MAN OF PRAYER WOULD LEAVE HIS OWN GODLY RAIMENT IN ORDER TO TAKE A LAYMAN'S JERKIN HE HAD HE SAID BUT GONE FOR A WHILE THAT I MIGHT BE THE FREER FOR MY DEVOTIONS
2198-151049-0050 ON THIS I PLUCKED OFF THE GOWN AND HE WITH MUCH SHOW OF HASTE DID BEGIN TO UNDO HIS POINTS BUT WHEN I THREW HIS FROCK DOWN HE CLIPPED IT UP AND RAN OFF ALL UNTRUSSED LEAVING ME IN THIS SORRY PLIGHT
2198-151049-0051 HE LAUGHED SO THE WHILE LIKE A GREAT CROAKING FROG THAT I MIGHT HAVE CAUGHT HIM HAD MY BREATH NOT BEEN AS SHORT AS HIS LEGS WERE LONG THE YOUNG MAN LISTENED TO THIS TALE OF WRONG WITH ALL THE SERIOUSNESS THAT HE COULD MAINTAIN BUT
2198-151049-0052 AT THE SIGHT OF THE PURSY RED FACED MAN AND THE DIGNITY WITH WHICH HE BORE HIM THE LAUGHTER CAME SO THICK UPON HIM THAT HE HAD TO LEAN UP AGAINST A TREE TRUNK THE FULLER LOOKED SADLY AND GRAVELY AT HIM
2198-151049-0053 BUT FINDING THAT HE STILL LAUGHED HE BOWED WITH MUCH MOCK POLITENESS AND STALKED ONWARDS IN HIS BORROWED CLOTHES ALLEYNE WATCHED HIM UNTIL HE WAS SMALL IN THE DISTANCE AND THEN WIPING THE TEARS FROM HIS EYES
