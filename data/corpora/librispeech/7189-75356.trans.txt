7189-75356-0000 MUTILATION BY CROWDING THE SAME CURSE OF SUFFERING VITIATES AGRIPPA'S INGENIOUS PARABLE AND THE JOYFUL HUMILITY OF DANTE'S CELESTIAL FRIENDS AND RENDERS BOTH EQUALLY IRRELEVANT TO HUMAN CONDITIONS
7189-75356-0001 NATURE MAY ARRANGE HER HIERARCHIES AS SHE CHOOSES
7189-75356-0002 THAT INTERRELATION IS NO INJURY TO ANY PART AND AN ADDED BEAUTY IN THE WHOLE
7189-75356-0003 IN ATTAINING ITS OWN END TO MAKE THE ATTAINMENTS OF THE OTHERS ENDS POSSIBLE TO THEM ALSO AN APPROACH TO SUCH AN EQUILIBRIUM HAS ACTUALLY BEEN REACHED IN SOME RESPECTS BY THE ROUGH SIFTING OF MISCELLANEOUS ORGANISMS
7189-75356-0004 UNTIL THOSE THAT WERE COMPATIBLE ALONE REMAINED BUT NATURE IN HER HASTE TO BE FERTILE WANTS TO PRODUCE EVERYTHING AT ONCE AND HER DISTRACTED INDUSTRY HAS BROUGHT ABOUT TERRIBLE CONFUSION AND WASTE AND TERRIBLE INJUSTICE
7189-75356-0005 SHE HAS BEEN LED TO PUNISH HER MINISTERS FOR THE SERVICES THEY RENDER AND HER FAVOURITES FOR THE HONOURS THEY RECEIVE SHE HAS IMPOSED SUFFERING ON HER CREATURES TOGETHER WITH LIFE SHE HAS DEFEATED HER OWN OBJECTS AND VITIATED HER BOUNTY
7189-75356-0006 BY LETTING EVERY GOOD DO HARM AND BRING EVIL IN ITS TRAIN TO SOME UNSUSPECTING CREATURE THIS OPPRESSION IS THE MORAL STAIN THAT ATTACHES TO ARISTOCRACY AND MAKES IT TRULY UNJUST EVERY PRIVILEGE THAT IMPOSES SUFFERING INVOLVES A WRONG
7189-75356-0007 NOT ONLY DOES ARISTOCRACY LAY ON THE WORLD A TAX IN LABOUR AND PRIVATION THAT ITS OWN SPLENDOURS INTELLECTUAL AND WORLDLY MAY ARISE
7189-75356-0008 IT INFECTS INTELLIGENCE AND GRANDEUR WITH INHUMANITY AND RENDERS CORRUPT AND ODIOUS THAT PRE EMINENCE WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIVINE THE LOWER CLASSES IN SUBMITTING TO THE HARDSHIP AND MEANNESS OF THEIR LIVES
7189-75356-0009 WHICH TO BE SURE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HARDER AND MEANER HAD NO ARISTOCRACY EXISTED MUST UPBRAID THEIR FELLOW MEN FOR PROFITING BY THEIR ILL FORTUNE AND THEREFORE HAVING AN INTEREST IN PERPETUATING IT INSTEAD OF THE BRUTAL BUT INNOCENT INJUSTICE OF NATURE
7189-75356-0010 WHAT THEY SUFFER FROM IS THE SLY INJUSTICE OF MEN AND THOUGH THE SUFFERING BE LESS FOR THE WORST OF MEN IS HUMAN THE INJURY IS MORE SENSIBLE THE INCLEMENCIES AND DANGERS MEN MUST ENDURE IN A SAVAGE STATE IN SCOURGING THEM
7189-75356-0011 WOULD NOT HAVE PROFITED BY THAT CRUELTY BUT SUFFERING HAS AN ADDED STING WHEN IT ENABLES OTHERS TO BE EXEMPT FROM CARE AND TO LIVE LIKE THE GODS IN IRRESPONSIBLE EASE THE INEQUALITY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN INNOCENT AND EVEN BEAUTIFUL IN A HAPPY WORLD
7189-75356-0012 BECOMES IN A PAINFUL WORLD A BITTER WRONG
7189-75356-0013 IT WOULD BE A HAPPY RELIEF TO THE ARISTOCRAT'S CONSCIENCE WHEN HE POSSESSES ONE COULD HE LEARN FROM SOME YET BOLDER DESCARTES THAT COMMON PEOPLE WERE NOTHING
7189-75356-0014 AND THAT ONLY A GROUNDLESS PREJUDICE HAD HITHERTO LED US TO SUPPOSE THAT LIFE COULD EXIST WHERE EVIDENTLY NOTHING GOOD COULD BE ATTAINED BY LIVING IF ALL UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE COULD BE PROVED TO BE UNCONSCIOUS AUTOMATA WHAT A BRILLIANT JUSTIFICATION
7189-75356-0015 THAT WOULD BE FOR THE WAYS OF BOTH GOD AND MAN PHILOSOPHY WOULD NOT LACK ARGUMENTS TO SUPPORT SUCH AN AGREEABLE CONCLUSION BEGINNING WITH THE AXIOM THAT WHATEVER IS IS RIGHT
7189-75356-0016 THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS SOMETHING SELF EXISTENT AND INDUBITABLY REAL THEREFORE HE WOULD CONTEND IT MUST BE SELF JUSTIFYING AND INDUBITABLY GOOD AND HE MIGHT CONTINUE BY SAYING THAT A SLAVE'S LIFE WAS NOT ITS OWN EXCUSE FOR BEING
7189-75356-0017 NOR WERE THE LABOURS OF A MILLION DRUDGES OTHERWISE JUSTIFIED THAN BY THE CONVENIENCES WHICH THEY SUPPLIED THEIR MASTERS WITH ERGO THOSE SERVILE OPERATIONS COULD COME TO CONSCIOUSNESS ONLY WHERE THEY ATTAINED THEIR END
7189-75356-0018 AND THE WORLD COULD CONTAIN NOTHING BUT PERFECT AND UNIVERSAL HAPPINESS A DIVINE OMNISCIENCE AND JOY SHARED BY FINITE MINDS IN SO FAR AS THEY MIGHT ATTAIN PERFECTION WOULD BE THE ONLY LIFE IN EXISTENCE AND THE NOTION THAT SUCH A THING AS PAIN
7189-75356-0019 WOULD FORTHWITH VANISH LIKE THE HIDEOUS AND RIDICULOUS ILLUSION THAT IT WAS THIS ARGUMENT MAY BE RECOMMENDED TO APOLOGETIC WRITERS AS NO WEAKER THAN THOSE THEY COMMONLY RELY ON
7189-75356-0020 BUT SO LONG AS PEOPLE REMAIN ON WHAT SUCH AN INVALUABLE OPTIMIST MIGHT CALL THE LOW LEVEL OF SENSUOUS THOUGHT AND SO LONG AS WE IMAGINE THAT WE EXIST AND SUFFER AN ARISTOCRATIC REGIMEN CAN ONLY BE JUSTIFIED
7189-75356-0021 BY RADIATING BENEFIT AND BY PROVING THAT WERE LESS GIVEN TO THOSE ABOVE LESS WOULD BE ATTAINED BY THOSE BENEATH THEM SUCH REVERSION OF BENEFIT MIGHT TAKE A MATERIAL FORM AS WHEN BY COMMERCIAL GUIDANCE AND MILITARY PROTECTION
7189-75356-0022 A GREATER NET PRODUCT IS SECURED TO LABOUR EVEN AFTER ALL NEEDFUL TAXES HAVE BEEN LEVIED UPON IT TO SUPPORT GREATNESS AN INDUSTRIAL AND POLITICAL OLIGARCHY MIGHT DEFEND ITSELF ON THAT GROUND OR THE RETURN MIGHT TAKE THE LESS POSITIVE FORM OF OPPORTUNITY
7189-75356-0023 AS IT DOES WHEN AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY HAS A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT HERE THE PEOPLE NEITHER ACCEPT GUIDANCE NOR REQUIRE PROTECTION BUT THE EXISTENCE OF A RICH AND IRRESPONSIBLE CLASS OFFERS THEM AN IDEAL SUCH AS IT IS
7189-75356-0024 IN THEIR AMBITIOUS STRUGGLES FOR THEY TOO MAY GROW RICH EXERCISE FINANCIAL ASCENDANCY EDUCATE THEIR SONS LIKE GENTLEMEN AND LAUNCH THEIR DAUGHTERS INTO FASHIONABLE SOCIETY FINALLY
7189-75356-0025 IF THE ONLY ARISTOCRACY RECOGNISED WERE AN ARISTOCRACY OF ACHIEVEMENT AND IF PUBLIC REWARDS FOLLOWED PERSONAL MERIT THE REVERSION TO THE PEOPLE MIGHT TAKE THE FORM OF PARTICIPATION BY THEM IN THE IDEAL INTERESTS OF EMINENT MEN HOLINESS
7189-75356-0026 GENIUS AND KNOWLEDGE CAN REVERBERATE THROUGH ALL SOCIETY THE FRUITS OF ART AND SCIENCE ARE IN THEMSELVES CHEAP AND NOT TO BE MONOPOLISED OR CONSUMED IN ENJOYMENT ON THE CONTRARY THEIR WIDER DIFFUSION STIMULATES THEIR GROWTH
7189-75356-0027 AND MAKES THEIR CULTIVATION MORE INTENSE AND SUCCESSFUL WHEN AN IDEAL INTEREST IS GENERAL THE SHARE WHICH FALLS TO THE PRIVATE PERSON IS THE MORE APT TO BE EFFICACIOUS THE SAINTS HAVE USUALLY HAD COMPANIONS
7189-75356-0028 AND ARTISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS HAVE FLOURISHED IN SCHOOLS AT THE SAME TIME IDEAL GOODS CANNOT BE ASSIMILATED WITHOUT SOME TRAINING AND LEISURE LIKE EDUCATION AND RELIGION THEY ARE DEGRADED BY POPULARITY
7189-75356-0029 AND REDUCED FROM WHAT THE MASTER INTENDED TO WHAT THE PEOPLE ARE ABLE AND WILLING TO RECEIVE SO PLEASING AN IDEA THEN AS THIS OF DIFFUSED IDEAL POSSESSIONS HAS LITTLE APPLICATION IN A SOCIETY ARISTOCRATICALLY FRAMED
7189-75356-0030 FOR THE GREATER EMINENCE THE FEW ATTAIN THE LESS ABLE ARE THE MANY TO FOLLOW THEM GREAT THOUGHTS REQUIRE A GREAT MIND AND PURE BEAUTIES A PROFOUND SENSIBILITY TO ATTEMPT TO GIVE SUCH THINGS A WIDE CURRENCY
7189-75356-0031 IN ORDER TO BOAST THAT THEY HAVE BEEN PROPAGATED CULTURE IS ON THE HORNS OF THIS DILEMMA IF PROFOUND AND NOBLE IT MUST REMAIN RARE IF COMMON IT MUST BECOME MEAN THESE ALTERNATIVES CAN NEVER BE ELUDED
7189-75356-0032 UNTIL SOME PURIFIED AND HIGH BRED RACE SUCCEEDS THE PROMISCUOUS BIPEDS
7189-75356-0033 ADDS WRONG TO NATURE'S INJURY
7189-75356-0034 LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE HAS NO PRACTICAL FORCE SAVE THAT WHICH MECHANICAL CAUSES ENDOW IT WITH ITS PRIVILEGES ARE FRUITS OF INEVITABLE ADVANTAGES ITS OPPRESSIONS ARE SIMPLY NEW FORMS AND VEHICLES
7189-75356-0035 FOR NATURE'S PRIMEVAL CRUELTY WHILE THE BENEFITS IT MAY ALSO CONFER ARE ONLY FURTHER EXAMPLES OF HER NICE EQUILIBRIUM AND NECESSARY HARMONY FOR IT LIES IN THE ESSENCE OF A MECHANICAL WORLD WHERE THE INTERESTS OF ITS PRODUCTS
7189-75356-0036 ARE CONCERNED TO BE FUNDAMENTALLY KIND SINCE IT HAS FORMED AND ON THE WHOLE MAINTAINS THOSE PRODUCTS AND YET CONTINUALLY CRUEL SINCE IT FORMS AND MAINTAINS THEM BLINDLY WITHOUT CONSIDERING DIFFICULTIES OR PROBABLE FAILURES
7189-75356-0037 NOW THE MOST TYRANNICAL GOVERNMENT LIKE THE BEST IS A NATURAL PRODUCT MAINTAINED BY AN EQUILIBRIUM OF NATURAL FORCES IT IS SIMPLY A NEW MODE OF MECHANICAL ENERGY TO WHICH THE PHILOSOPHER LIVING UNDER IT MUST ADJUST HIMSELF
7189-75356-0038 AS HE WOULD TO THE WEATHER BUT WHEN THE VEHICLE OF NATURE'S INCLEMENCY IS A HEARTLESS MAN EVEN IF THE HARM DONE BE LESS IT PUTS ON A NEW AND A MORAL ASPECT THE SOURCE OF INJURY IS THEN NOT ONLY NATURAL BUT CRIMINAL AS WELL
7189-75356-0039 AND THE RESULT IS A SENSE OF WRONG ADDED TO MISFORTUNE IT MUST NEEDS BE THAT OFFENCE COME BUT WOE TO HIM BY WHOM THE OFFENCE COMETH HE JUSTLY AROUSES INDIGNATION
7189-75356-0040 NOW CIVILISATION CANNOT AFFORD TO ENTANGLE ITS IDEALS WITH THE CAUSES OF REMORSE AND OF JUST INDIGNATION IN THE FIRST PLACE NATURE IN HER SLOW AND PONDEROUS WAY
7189-75356-0041 LEVELS HER PROCESSES AND RUBS OFF HER SHARP EDGES BY PERPETUAL FRICTION WHERE THERE IS MALADJUSTMENT THERE IS NO PERMANENT PHYSICAL STABILITY THEREFORE THE IDEAL OF SOCIETY
7189-75356-0042 CAN NEVER INVOLVE THE INFLICTION OF INJURY ON ANYBODY FOR ANY PURPOSE SUCH AN IDEAL WOULD PROPOSE FOR A GOAL SOMETHING OUT OF EQUILIBRIUM A SOCIETY WHICH EVEN IF ESTABLISHED COULD NOT MAINTAIN ITSELF
7189-75356-0043 BUT AN IDEAL LIFE MUST NOT TEND TO DESTROY ITS IDEAL BY ABOLISHING ITS OWN EXISTENCE IN THE SECOND PLACE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE ON MORAL GROUNDS THAT INJUSTICE SHOULD SUBSIST IN THE IDEAL THE IDEAL MEANS THE PERFECT
7189-75356-0044 AND A SUPPOSED IDEAL IN WHICH WRONG STILL SUBSISTED WOULD BE THE DENIAL OF PERFECTION THE IDEAL STATE AND THE IDEAL UNIVERSE SHOULD BE A FAMILY WHERE ALL ARE NOT EQUAL BUT WHERE ALL ARE HAPPY
7189-75356-0045 SO THAT AN ARISTOCRATIC OR THEISTIC SYSTEM IN ORDER TO DESERVE RESPECT MUST DISCARD ITS SINISTER APOLOGIES FOR EVIL AND CLEARLY PROPOSE SUCH AN ORDER OF EXISTENCES ONE SUPERPOSED UPON THE OTHER AS SHOULD INVOLVE NO SUFFERING ON ANY OF ITS LEVELS
7189-75356-0046 THE SERVICES REQUIRED OF EACH MUST INVOLVE NO INJURY TO ANY TO PERFORM THEM SHOULD BE MADE THE SERVANT'S SPONTANEOUS AND SPECIFIC IDEAL
