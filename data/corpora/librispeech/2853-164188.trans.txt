2853-164188-0000 IT WAS LATE THAT NIGHT WHEN MISS MAPP FELT THAT SHE WAS PHYSICALLY INCAPABLE OF TACKING ON A SINGLE POPPY MORE TO THE EDGE OF HER SKIRT AND WENT TO THE WINDOW OF THE GARDEN ROOM WHERE SHE HAD BEEN WORKING TO CLOSE IT
2853-164188-0001 SHE GLANCED TO THE RIGHT AND CONCLUDED THAT HER GARDENER HAD GONE TO BED FINALLY SHE GLANCED DOWN THE STREET AND SAW WITH A PANG OF PLEASURE THAT THE WINDOWS OF THE MAJOR'S HOUSE SHOWED NO SIGN OF MIDNIGHT LABOUR THIS WAS INTENSELY GRATIFYING
2853-164188-0002 IT INDICATED THAT HER INFLUENCE WAS AT WORK IN HIM FOR IN RESPONSE TO HER WISH SO OFTEN AND SO TACTFULLY URGED ON HIM THAT HE WOULD GO TO BED EARLIER AND NOT WORK SO HARD AT NIGHT HERE WAS THE DARKENED WINDOW AND SHE DISMISSED AS UNWORTHY
2853-164188-0003 THE SUSPICION WHICH HAD BEEN AROUSED BY THE RED CURRANT FOOL THE WINDOW OF HIS BEDROOM WAS DARK TOO HE MUST HAVE ALREADY PUT OUT HIS LIGHT AND MISS MAPP MADE HASTE OVER HER LITTLE TIDYINGS SO THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE FOUND A TRANSGRESSOR TO HER OWN PRECEPTS
2853-164188-0004 AND THAT IT WAS NOTHING ELSE OF LESS PURE AND INNOCENT ALLUREMENT THAT KEPT HIM UP AS SHE CLOSED THE WINDOW VERY GENTLY IT DID JUST SEEM TO HER THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING EQUALLY BAFFLING IN MAJOR FLINT'S EGOISTICAL VIGILS OVER HIS DIARIES
2853-164188-0005 WHICH KEPT HIS LIGHTS BURNING SO LATE BUT SHE WOULD NOW CROSS HIM DEAR MAN AND HIS LATE HABITS OUT OF THE LIST OF RIDDLES ABOUT TILLING WHICH AWAITED SOLUTION WHATEVER IT HAD BEEN DIARIES OR WHAT NOT THAT USED TO KEEP HIM UP HE HAD BROKEN THE HABIT NOW
2853-164188-0006 WHEREAS CAPTAIN PUFFIN HAD NOT SHE TOOK HER POPPY BORDERED SKIRT OVER HER ARM AND SMILED HER THANKFUL WAY TO BED SHE COULD ALLOW HERSELF TO WONDER WITH A LITTLE MORE DEFINITENESS NOW THAT THE MAJOR'S LIGHTS WERE OUT AND HE WAS ABED
2853-164188-0007 WHAT IT COULD BE WHICH RENDERED CAPTAIN PUFFIN SO OBLIVIOUS TO THE PASSAGE OF TIME WHEN HE WAS INVESTIGATING ROMAN ROADS HOW GLAD SHE WAS THAT THE MAJOR WAS NOT WITH HIM
2853-164188-0008 HAVING PUT HER WINDOW OPEN SHE TROD SOFTLY SO AS NOT TO DISTURB THE SLUMBERER NEXT DOOR ACROSS HER ROOM ON HER FAT WHITE FEET TO HER BIG WHITE BED GOOD NIGHT MAJOR BENJY SHE WHISPERED AS SHE PUT HER LIGHT OUT
2853-164188-0009 THREE TONS IN HER CELLAR AND AS SOON AS HER VISITOR HAD LEFT HER THIS MORNING SHE POPPED OUT TO SEE MISTER WOOTTEN HER COAL MERCHANT
2853-164188-0010 SHE RETURNED IN A STATE OF FURY FOR THERE WERE NO REGULATIONS WHATEVER IN EXISTENCE WITH REGARD TO THE AMOUNT OF COAL THAT ANY HOUSEHOLDER MIGHT CHOOSE TO AMASS AND MISTER WOOTTEN COMPLIMENTED HER ON HER PRUDENCE IN HAVING GOT IN A REASONABLE SUPPLY FOR HE THOUGHT IT QUITE PROBABLE THAT
2853-164188-0011 IF THE COAL STRIKE TOOK PLACE THERE WOULD BE SOME DIFFICULTY IN A MONTH'S TIME FROM NOW IN REPLENISHING CELLARS BUT WE'VE HAD A GOOD SUPPLY ALL THE SUMMER ADDED AGREEABLE MISTER WOOTTEN AND ALL MY CUSTOMERS HAVE GOT THEIR CELLARS WELL STOCKED
2853-164188-0012 OH BUT MISTER WOOTTEN SHE SAID MISS MAPP POPPED DROPPED IN TO SEE ME JUST NOW TOLD ME SHE HAD HARDLY GOT ANY MISTER WOOTTEN TURNED UP HIS LEDGER IT WAS NOT ETIQUETTE TO DISCLOSE THE AFFAIRS OF ONE CLIENT TO ANOTHER
2853-164188-0013 BUT IF THERE WAS A CANTANKEROUS CUSTOMER ONE WHO WAS NEVER SATISFIED WITH PRICES AND QUALITY THAT CLIENT WAS MISS MAPP HE ALLOWED A BROAD GRIN TO OVERSPREAD HIS AGREEABLE FACE WELL MA'AM
2853-164188-0014 IF IN A MONTH'S TIME I'M SHORT OF COAL THERE ARE FRIENDS OF YOURS IN TILLING WHO CAN LET YOU HAVE PLENTY HE PERMITTED HIMSELF TO SAY IT WAS IDLE TO ATTEMPT TO CUT OUT BUNCHES OF ROSES WHILE HER HAND WAS SO FEVERISH AND SHE TRUNDLED UP AND DOWN THE HIGH STREET TO COOL OFF
2853-164188-0015 HAD SHE NOT BEEN SO PRUDENT AS TO MAKE INQUIRIES AS LIKELY AS NOT SHE WOULD HAVE SENT A TON OF COAL THAT VERY DAY TO THE HOSPITAL SO STRONGLY HAD ELIZABETH'S PERFIDIOUS WARNING INFLAMED HER IMAGINATION AS TO THE FATE OF HOARDERS
2853-164188-0016 AND ALL THE TIME ELIZABETH'S OWN CELLARS WERE GLUTTED THOUGH SHE HAD ASSERTED THAT SHE WAS ALMOST FUELLESS
2853-164188-0017 AS THE COOLING PROCESS WENT ON SHE BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER IT WAS WORSTED ALONE THAT HAD PROMPTED HER FRIEND'S DIABOLICAL SUGGESTION
2853-164188-0018 AND IT WAS EVER SO LIKE HER TO DIVERT SUSPICION BY PRETENDING HER CELLAR WAS NEXT TO EMPTY SHE HAD BEEN EQUALLY SEVERE ON ANY WHO MIGHT HAPPEN TO BE HOARDING FOOD IN CASE TRANSPORT WAS DISARRANGED AND SUPPLIES FELL SHORT AND WITH A SUDDEN FLARE OF AUTHENTIC INTUITION
2853-164188-0019 LUCK EVER ATTENDS THE BOLD AND CONSTRUCTIVE THINKER THE APPLE FOR INSTANCE FELL FROM THE TREE PRECISELY WHEN NEWTON'S MIND WAS GROPING AFTER THE LAW OF GRAVITY
2853-164188-0020 FOR SHE HAD BEEN OCCUPIED WITH ROSES EVER SINCE BREAKFAST THE ATTENDANT WAS AT THE TELEPHONE AT THE BACK OF THE SHOP HE SPOKE IN A LUCID TELEPHONE VOICE
2853-164188-0021 HER VOICE WAS TREMULOUS WITH ANXIETY AND INVESTIGATION GOT ANY BIG TINS OF CORNED BEEF THE ONES THAT CONTAIN SIX POUNDS
2853-164188-0022 AND THEY'VE JUST BEEN ORDERED A SMALL POT OF GINGER THEN PLEASE SAID DIVA RECKLESSLY WILL YOU SEND IT ROUND IMMEDIATELY YES MA'AM THE BOY'S JUST GOING OUT THAT WAS LUCK
2853-164188-0023 FOR ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE GROCER'S BOY CAME OUT OF THE SHOP WITH A HEAVY BASKET ON HIS ARM
2853-164188-0024 THAT LED TO MISS MAPP'S HOUSE WAS VERY PROTRACTED AT THE CORNER HE DELIBERATELY PUT DOWN THE BASKET ALTOGETHER
2853-164188-0025 HAVING REFRESHED HIMSELF HE TURNED UP THE STEEP STREET HE PASSED THE FISHMONGER'S AND THE FRUITERER'S HE DID NOT TAKE THE TURN DOWN TO THE DENTIST'S AND MISTER WYSE'S HE HAD NO ERRAND TO THE MAJOR'S HOUSE OR TO THE CAPTAIN'S THEN
2853-164188-0026 HE RANG THE BELL AT MISS MAPP'S BACK DOOR
2853-164188-0027 AND WALKING SO SLOWLY THAT THE MOTION OF HER FEET SEEMED NOT CIRCULAR AT ALL THEN THE BELL WAS ANSWERED AND HE DELIVERED INTO WITHERS'S HANDS ONE TWO TINS OF CORNED BEEF AND A ROUND OX TONGUE
2853-164188-0028 HE PUT THE BASKET ON HIS HEAD AND CAME DOWN THE STREET AGAIN SHRILLY WHISTLING
2853-164188-0029 NOW SHE HAD ALREADY NOTICED THAT ELIZABETH HAD PAID VISITS TO THE GROCER'S ON THREE CONSECUTIVE DAYS THREE CONSECUTIVE DAYS THINK OF IT AND GIVEN THAT HER PURCHASES ON OTHER OCCASIONS HAD BEEN ON THE SAME SUBSTANTIAL SCALE AS TO DAY
2853-164188-0030 IT BECAME A MATTER OF THRILLING INTEREST AS TO WHERE SHE KEPT THESE STORES SHE COULD NOT KEEP THEM IN THE COAL CELLAR FOR THAT WAS ALREADY BURSTING WITH COAL
2853-164188-0031 THE BASE ONE IN MAKING A PRODIGIOUS QUANTITY OF JAM THAT YEAR FROM HER WELL STOCKED GARDEN WAS AWARE THAT THE KITCHEN CUPBOARDS WERE LIKE TO BE AS REPLETE AS THE COAL CELLAR BEFORE THOSE HOARDINGS OF DEAD OXEN BEGAN
2853-164188-0032 BUT THAT COULD SCARCELY BE THE SITE OF THIS PRODIGIOUS CACHE FOR IT WAS FULL OF CARDBOARD AND CURTAINS AND CARPETS AND ALL THE RUBBISHY ACCUMULATIONS WHICH ELIZABETH COULD NOT BEAR TO PART WITH
2853-164188-0033 THEN SHE HAD LARGE CUPBOARDS IN HER BEDROOM AND SPARE ROOMS FULL TO OVERFLOWING OF MOULDY CLOTHES
2853-164188-0034 AND SHE CRUSHED HER TEMPLES IN HER HANDS IN THE ATTEMPT TO LOCATE THE HIDING PLACE OF THE HOARD
2853-164188-0035 AND IN HER EXCITEMENT SNAPPED HER SCISSORS WITH SO RANDOM A STROKE THAT SHE COMPLETELY CUT IN HALF THE BUNCH OF ROSES THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED ON THERE WAS ANOTHER CUPBOARD THE BEST AND BIGGEST OF ALL AND THE MOST SECRET AND THE MOST DISCREET
2853-164188-0036 IT LAY EMBEDDED IN THE WALL OF THE GARDEN ROOM CLOAKED AND CONCEALED BEHIND THE SHELVES OF A FALSE BOOK CASE WHICH CONTAINED NO MORE THAN THE SIMULACRA OF BOOKS JUST BOOKS WITH TITLES THAT HAD NEVER YET APPEARED ON ANY HONEST BOOK
2853-164188-0037 A SHELF FULL OF ELEGANT EXTRACTS THERE WERE VOLUMES SIMPLY CALLED POEMS THERE WERE COMMENTARIES THERE WERE TRAVELS AND ASTRONOMY AND THE LOWEST AND TALLEST SHELF WAS FULL OF MUSIC
2853-164188-0038 HAD NOTICED A MODEST CATCH LET INTO THE WOODWORK
2853-164188-0039 DOUBT THEN THE BOOKCASE WAS THE DOOR OF THE CUPBOARD AND WITH A STROKE OF INTUITION TOO SURE TO BE CALLED A GUESS
