1473-135657-0000 AND OUR ENQUIRIES IN THE COURSE OF TWO THOUSAND YEARS BEEN ABLE TO PASS FROM WORDS TO THE TRUE AND REAL SUBJECT OF THE CONTROVERSY FOR HOW EASY MAY IT SEEM TO GIVE EXACT DEFINITIONS OF THE TERMS EMPLOYED IN REASONING
1473-135657-0001 AND MAKE THESE DEFINITIONS NOT THE MERE SOUND OF WORDS THE OBJECT OF FUTURE SCRUTINY AND EXAMINATION BUT IF WE CONSIDER THE MATTER MORE NARROWLY WE SHALL BE APT TO DRAW A QUITE OPPOSITE CONCLUSION
1473-135657-0002 FROM THIS CIRCUMSTANCE ALONE THAT A CONTROVERSY HAS BEEN LONG KEPT ON FOOT AND REMAINS STILL UNDECIDED WE MAY PRESUME THAT THERE IS SOME AMBIGUITY IN THE EXPRESSION AND THAT THE DISPUTANTS AFFIX DIFFERENT IDEAS TO THE TERMS EMPLOYED IN THE CONTROVERSY
1473-135657-0003 FOR AS THE FACULTIES OF THE MIND ARE SUPPOSED TO BE NATURALLY ALIKE IN EVERY INDIVIDUAL OTHERWISE NOTHING COULD BE MORE FRUITLESS THAN TO REASON OR DISPUTE TOGETHER IT WERE IMPOSSIBLE
1473-135657-0004 IF MEN AFFIX THE SAME IDEAS TO THEIR TERMS THAT THEY COULD SO LONG FORM DIFFERENT OPINIONS OF THE SAME SUBJECT ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY COMMUNICATE THEIR VIEWS AND EACH PARTY TURN THEMSELVES ON ALL SIDES
1473-135657-0005 IN SEARCH OF ARGUMENTS WHICH MAY GIVE THEM THE VICTORY OVER THEIR ANTAGONISTS IT IS TRUE IF MEN ATTEMPT THE DISCUSSION OF QUESTIONS WHICH LIE ENTIRELY BEYOND THE REACH OF HUMAN CAPACITY
1473-135657-0006 SUCH AS THOSE CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF WORLDS OR THE ECONOMY OF THE INTELLECTUAL SYSTEM OR REGION OF SPIRITS THEY MAY LONG BEAT THE AIR IN THEIR FRUITLESS CONTESTS AND NEVER ARRIVE AT ANY DETERMINATE CONCLUSION BUT IF THE QUESTION REGARD
1473-135657-0007 ANY SUBJECT OF COMMON LIFE AND EXPERIENCE NOTHING ONE WOULD THINK COULD PRESERVE THE DISPUTE SO LONG UNDECIDED BUT SOME AMBIGUOUS EXPRESSIONS WHICH KEEP THE ANTAGONISTS STILL AT A DISTANCE
1473-135657-0008 AND TO SO REMARKABLE A DEGREE THAT IF I BE NOT MUCH MISTAKEN WE SHALL FIND THAT ALL MANKIND BOTH LEARNED AND IGNORANT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OF THE SAME OPINION WITH REGARD TO THIS SUBJECT AND THAT A FEW INTELLIGIBLE DEFINITIONS WOULD IMMEDIATELY HAVE PUT
1473-135657-0009 AN END TO THE WHOLE CONTROVERSY I OWN THAT THIS DISPUTE HAS BEEN SO MUCH CANVASSED ON ALL HANDS AND HAS LED PHILOSOPHERS INTO SUCH A LABYRINTH OF OBSCURE SOPHISTRY THAT IT IS NO WONDER
1473-135657-0010 PROMISES AT LEAST SOME DECISION OF THE CONTROVERSY AND WILL NOT MUCH DISTURB HIS EASE BY ANY INTRICATE OR OBSCURE REASONING I HOPE THEREFORE TO MAKE IT APPEAR THAT ALL MEN HAVE EVER AGREED IN THE DOCTRINE
1473-135657-0011 BOTH OF NECESSITY AND OF LIBERTY ACCORDING TO ANY REASONABLE SENSE WHICH CAN BE PUT ON THESE TERMS AND THAT THE WHOLE CONTROVERSY HAS HITHERTO TURNED MERELY UPON WORDS
1473-135657-0012 IN ALL ITS OPERATIONS IS ACTUATED BY A NECESSARY FORCE AND THAT EVERY NATURAL EFFECT IS SO PRECISELY DETERMINED BY THE ENERGY OF ITS CAUSE THAT NO OTHER EFFECT IN SUCH PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD POSSIBLY HAVE RESULTED FROM IT
1473-135657-0013 THE DEGREE AND DIRECTION OF EVERY MOTION IS BY THE LAWS OF NATURE PRESCRIBED WITH SUCH EXACTNESS THAT A LIVING CREATURE MAY AS SOON ARISE FROM THE SHOCK OF TWO BODIES AS MOTION IN ANY OTHER DEGREE OR DIRECTION THAN WHAT IS ACTUALLY PRODUCED BY IT
1473-135657-0014 WOULD WE THEREFORE FORM A JUST AND PRECISE IDEA OF NECESSITY WE MUST CONSIDER WHENCE THAT IDEA ARISES WHEN WE APPLY IT TO THE OPERATION OF BODIES IT SEEMS EVIDENT THAT
1473-135657-0015 IF ALL THE SCENES OF NATURE WERE CONTINUALLY SHIFTED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT NO TWO EVENTS BORE ANY RESEMBLANCE TO EACH OTHER BUT EVERY OBJECT WAS ENTIRELY NEW WITHOUT ANY SIMILITUDE TO WHATEVER HAD BEEN SEEN BEFORE WE SHOULD NEVER IN THAT CASE HAVE ATTAINED THE LEAST IDEA OF NECESSITY
1473-135657-0016 THAT ONE OBJECT OR EVENT HAS FOLLOWED ANOTHER NOT THAT ONE WAS PRODUCED BY THE OTHER THE RELATION OF CAUSE AND EFFECT MUST BE UTTERLY UNKNOWN TO MANKIND INFERENCE AND REASONING CONCERNING THE OPERATIONS OF NATURE WOULD FROM THAT MOMENT
1473-135657-0017 BE AT AN END AND THE MEMORY AND SENSES REMAIN THE ONLY CANALS BY WHICH THE KNOWLEDGE OF ANY REAL EXISTENCE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE ACCESS TO THE MIND OUR IDEA THEREFORE OF NECESSITY AND CAUSATION ARISES ENTIRELY FROM THE UNIFORMITY OBSERVABLE
1473-135657-0018 IN THE OPERATIONS OF NATURE WHERE SIMILAR OBJECTS ARE CONSTANTLY CONJOINED TOGETHER AND THE MIND IS DETERMINED BY CUSTOM TO INFER THE ONE FROM THE APPEARANCE OF THE OTHER
1473-135657-0019 WHICH WE ASCRIBE TO MATTER BEYOND THE CONSTANT CONJUNCTION OF SIMILAR OBJECTS AND THE CONSEQUENT INFERENCE FROM ONE TO THE OTHER WE HAVE NO NOTION OF ANY NECESSITY OR CONNEXION IF IT APPEAR THEREFORE THAT ALL MANKIND HAVE EVER ALLOWED
1473-135657-0020 WITHOUT ANY DOUBT OR HESITATION THAT THESE TWO CIRCUMSTANCES TAKE PLACE IN THE VOLUNTARY ACTIONS OF MEN AND IN THE OPERATIONS OF MIND IT MUST FOLLOW THAT ALL MANKIND HAVE EVER AGREED IN THE DOCTRINE OF NECESSITY AND THAT THEY HAVE HITHERTO DISPUTED
1473-135657-0021 WE MAY POSSIBLY SATISFY OURSELVES BY THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS IT IS UNIVERSALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE IS A GREAT UNIFORMITY AMONG THE ACTIONS OF MEN IN ALL NATIONS AND AGES AND THAT HUMAN NATURE REMAINS STILL THE SAME
1473-135657-0022 IN ITS PRINCIPLES AND OPERATIONS THE SAME MOTIVES ALWAYS PRODUCE THE SAME ACTIONS THE SAME EVENTS FOLLOW FROM THE SAME CAUSES AMBITION AVARICE SELF LOVE VANITY FRIENDSHIP
1473-135657-0023 GENEROSITY PUBLIC SPIRIT THESE PASSIONS MIXED IN VARIOUS DEGREES AND DISTRIBUTED THROUGH SOCIETY HAVE BEEN FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD AND STILL ARE THE SOURCE OF ALL THE ACTIONS AND ENTERPRISES WHICH HAVE EVER BEEN OBSERVED
1473-135657-0024 AMONG MANKIND WOULD YOU KNOW THE SENTIMENTS INCLINATIONS AND COURSE OF LIFE OF THE GREEKS AND ROMANS STUDY WELL THE TEMPER AND ACTIONS OF THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH YOU CANNOT BE MUCH MISTAKEN IN TRANSFERRING TO THE FORMER MOST OF THE OBSERVATIONS
1473-135657-0025 WHICH YOU HAVE MADE WITH REGARD TO THE LATTER MANKIND ARE SO MUCH THE SAME IN ALL TIMES AND PLACES THAT HISTORY INFORMS US OF NOTHING NEW OR STRANGE IN THIS PARTICULAR ITS CHIEF USE IS ONLY TO DISCOVER THE CONSTANT AND UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN NATURE
1473-135657-0026 BY SHOWING MEN IN ALL VARIETIES OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND SITUATIONS AND FURNISHING US WITH MATERIALS FROM WHICH WE MAY FORM OUR OBSERVATIONS AND BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THE REGULAR SPRINGS OF HUMAN ACTION AND BEHAVIOUR THESE RECORDS OF WARS INTRIGUES
1473-135657-0027 FACTIONS AND REVOLUTIONS ARE SO MANY COLLECTIONS OF EXPERIMENTS BY WHICH THE POLITICIAN OR MORAL PHILOSOPHER FIXES THE PRINCIPLES OF HIS SCIENCE IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE PHYSICIAN OR NATURAL PHILOSOPHER BECOMES ACQUAINTED WITH THE NATURE OF PLANTS MINERALS
1473-135657-0028 AND OTHER EXTERNAL OBJECTS BY THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH HE FORMS CONCERNING THEM NOR ARE THE EARTH WATER AND OTHER ELEMENTS EXAMINED BY ARISTOTLE AND HIPPOCRATES MORE LIKE TO THOSE WHICH AT PRESENT LIE UNDER OUR OBSERVATION THAN THE MEN DESCRIBED BY POLYBIUS AND TACITUS
1473-135657-0029 ARE TO THOSE WHO NOW GOVERN THE WORLD SHOULD A TRAVELLER RETURNING FROM A FAR COUNTRY BRING US AN ACCOUNT OF MEN WHOLLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY WITH WHOM WE WERE EVER ACQUAINTED MEN WHO WERE ENTIRELY DIVESTED OF AVARICE AMBITION OR REVENGE
1473-135657-0030 WHO KNEW NO PLEASURE BUT FRIENDSHIP GENEROSITY AND PUBLIC SPIRIT WE SHOULD IMMEDIATELY FROM THESE CIRCUMSTANCES DETECT THE FALSEHOOD AND PROVE HIM A LIAR WITH THE SAME CERTAINTY AS IF HE HAD STUFFED HIS NARRATION WITH STORIES OF CENTAURS AND DRAGONS
1473-135657-0031 MIRACLES AND PRODIGIES AND IF WE WOULD EXPLODE ANY FORGERY IN HISTORY WE CANNOT MAKE USE OF A MORE CONVINCING ARGUMENT THAN TO PROVE THAT THE ACTIONS ASCRIBED TO ANY PERSON ARE DIRECTLY CONTRARY TO THE COURSE OF NATURE AND THAT NO HUMAN MOTIVES IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
1473-135657-0032 COULD EVER INDUCE HIM TO SUCH A CONDUCT THE VERACITY OF QUINTUS CURTIUS IS AS MUCH TO BE SUSPECTED WHEN HE DESCRIBES THE SUPERNATURAL COURAGE OF ALEXANDER BY WHICH HE WAS HURRIED ON SINGLY TO ATTACK MULTITUDES AS WHEN HE DESCRIBES HIS SUPERNATURAL FORCE AND ACTIVITY
1473-135657-0033 SO READILY AND UNIVERSALLY DO WE ACKNOWLEDGE A UNIFORMITY IN HUMAN MOTIVES AND ACTIONS AS WELL AS IN THE OPERATIONS OF BODY HENCE LIKEWISE THE BENEFIT OF THAT EXPERIENCE ACQUIRED BY LONG LIFE AND A VARIETY OF BUSINESS AND COMPANY
1473-135657-0034 BY MEANS OF THIS GUIDE WE MOUNT UP TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF MEN'S INCLINATIONS AND MOTIVES FROM THEIR ACTIONS EXPRESSIONS AND EVEN GESTURES AND AGAIN DESCEND TO THE INTERPRETATION OF THEIR ACTIONS FROM OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR MOTIVES AND INCLINATIONS
1473-135657-0035 THE GENERAL OBSERVATIONS TREASURED UP BY A COURSE OF EXPERIENCE GIVE US THE CLUE OF HUMAN NATURE AND TEACH US TO UNRAVEL ALL ITS INTRICACIES PRETEXTS AND APPEARANCES NO LONGER DECEIVE US PUBLIC DECLARATIONS PASS FOR THE SPECIOUS COLOURING OF A CAUSE
1473-135657-0036 AND THOUGH VIRTUE AND HONOUR BE ALLOWED THEIR PROPER WEIGHT AND AUTHORITY THAT PERFECT DISINTERESTEDNESS SO OFTEN PRETENDED TO IS NEVER EXPECTED IN MULTITUDES AND PARTIES SELDOM IN THEIR LEADERS AND SCARCELY EVEN IN INDIVIDUALS OF ANY RANK OR STATION
1473-135657-0037 BUT WERE THERE NO UNIFORMITY IN HUMAN ACTIONS AND WERE EVERY EXPERIMENT WHICH WE COULD FORM OF THIS KIND IRREGULAR AND ANOMALOUS IT WERE IMPOSSIBLE TO COLLECT ANY GENERAL OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING MANKIND AND NO EXPERIENCE
1473-135657-0038 HOWEVER ACCURATELY DIGESTED BY REFLECTION WOULD EVER SERVE TO ANY PURPOSE WHY IS THE AGED HUSBANDMAN MORE SKILFUL IN HIS CALLING THAN THE YOUNG BEGINNER BUT BECAUSE THERE IS A CERTAIN UNIFORMITY IN THE OPERATION OF THE SUN RAIN AND EARTH
1473-135657-0039 TOWARDS THE PRODUCTION OF VEGETABLES AND EXPERIENCE TEACHES THE OLD PRACTITIONER THE RULES BY WHICH THIS OPERATION IS GOVERNED
1473-135657-0040 EXPECT THAT THIS UNIFORMITY OF HUMAN ACTIONS SHOULD BE CARRIED TO SUCH A LENGTH AS THAT ALL MEN IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ALWAYS ACT PRECISELY IN THE SAME MANNER WITHOUT MAKING ANY ALLOWANCE FOR THE DIVERSITY OF CHARACTERS PREJUDICES AND OPINIONS
1473-135657-0041 IS FOUND IN NO PART OF NATURE
1473-135657-0042 THIS AFFORDS ROOM FOR MANY GENERAL OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING THE GRADUAL CHANGE OF OUR SENTIMENTS AND INCLINATIONS AND THE DIFFERENT MAXIMS WHICH PREVAIL IN THE DIFFERENT AGES OF HUMAN CREATURES EVEN THE CHARACTERS WHICH ARE PECULIAR TO EACH INDIVIDUAL HAVE A UNIFORMITY IN THEIR INFLUENCE
1473-135657-0043 COULD NEVER TEACH US THEIR DISPOSITIONS
1473-135657-0044 WHICH SEEM TO HAVE NO REGULAR CONNEXION WITH ANY KNOWN MOTIVES
1473-135657-0045 WHICH HAVE EVER BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF MEN BUT IF WE WOULD WILLINGLY KNOW WHAT JUDGEMENT SHOULD BE FORMED OF SUCH IRREGULAR AND EXTRAORDINARY ACTIONS WE MAY CONSIDER THE SENTIMENTS COMMONLY ENTERTAINED WITH REGARD TO THOSE IRREGULAR EVENTS WHICH APPEAR IN THE COURSE OF NATURE
1473-135657-0046 AND THE OPERATIONS OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS
1473-135657-0047 AN ARTIFICER WHO HANDLES ONLY DEAD MATTER MAY BE DISAPPOINTED OF HIS AIM AS WELL AS THE POLITICIAN WHO DIRECTS THE CONDUCT OF SENSIBLE AND INTELLIGENT AGENTS THE VULGAR WHO TAKE THINGS ACCORDING TO THEIR FIRST APPEARANCE
1473-135657-0048 ATTRIBUTE THE UNCERTAINTY OF EVENTS TO SUCH AN UNCERTAINTY IN THE CAUSES AS MAKES THE LATTER OFTEN FAIL OF THEIR USUAL INFLUENCE
1473-135657-0049 THE CONTRARIETY OF EVENTS MAY NOT PROCEED FROM ANY CONTINGENCY IN THE CAUSE BUT FROM THE SECRET OPERATION OF CONTRARY CAUSES THIS POSSIBILITY IS CONVERTED INTO CERTAINTY BY FARTHER OBSERVATION WHEN THEY REMARK THAT UPON AN EXACT SCRUTINY
1473-135657-0050 A CONTRARIETY OF EFFECTS ALWAYS BETRAYS A CONTRARIETY OF CAUSES AND PROCEEDS FROM THEIR MUTUAL OPPOSITION A PEASANT CAN GIVE NO BETTER REASON FOR THE STOPPING OF ANY CLOCK OR WATCH THAN TO SAY THAT IT DOES NOT COMMONLY GO RIGHT BUT AN ARTIST
1473-135657-0051 EASILY PERCEIVES THAT THE SAME FORCE IN THE SPRING OR PENDULUM HAS ALWAYS THE SAME INFLUENCE ON THE WHEELS BUT FAILS OF ITS USUAL EFFECT PERHAPS BY REASON OF A GRAIN OF DUST WHICH PUTS A STOP TO THE WHOLE MOVEMENT FROM THE OBSERVATION OF SEVERAL PARALLEL INSTANCES
1473-135657-0052 PHILOSOPHERS FORM A MAXIM THAT THE CONNEXION BETWEEN ALL CAUSES AND EFFECTS IS EQUALLY NECESSARY AND THAT ITS SEEMING UNCERTAINTY IN SOME INSTANCES PROCEEDS FROM THE SECRET OPPOSITION OF CONTRARY CAUSES THUS FOR INSTANCE IN THE HUMAN BODY
1473-135657-0053 WHEN THE USUAL SYMPTOMS OF HEALTH OR SICKNESS DISAPPOINT OUR EXPECTATION WHEN MEDICINES OPERATE NOT WITH THEIR WONTED POWERS WHEN IRREGULAR EVENTS FOLLOW FROM ANY PARTICULAR CAUSE
1473-135657-0054 BY WHICH THE ANIMAL ECONOMY IS CONDUCTED THEY KNOW THAT A HUMAN BODY IS A MIGHTY COMPLICATED MACHINE THAT MANY SECRET POWERS LURK IN IT WHICH ARE ALTOGETHER BEYOND OUR COMPREHENSION THAT TO US
1473-135657-0055 IT MUST OFTEN APPEAR VERY UNCERTAIN IN ITS OPERATIONS AND THAT THEREFORE THE IRREGULAR EVENTS WHICH OUTWARDLY DISCOVER THEMSELVES CAN BE NO PROOF THAT THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE NOT OBSERVED WITH THE GREATEST REGULARITY
1473-135657-0056 A PERSON OF AN OBLIGING DISPOSITION GIVES A PEEVISH ANSWER BUT HE HAS THE TOOTHACHE OR HAS NOT DINED A STUPID FELLOW DISCOVERS AN UNCOMMON ALACRITY IN HIS CARRIAGE BUT HE HAS MET WITH A SUDDEN PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE
1473-135657-0057 TO SOME PERSONS WHO HAVE NO FIXED RULE FOR THEIR CONDUCT BUT PROCEED IN A CONTINUED COURSE OF CAPRICE AND INCONSTANCY THE INTERNAL PRINCIPLES AND MOTIVES MAY OPERATE IN A UNIFORM MANNER NOTWITHSTANDING THESE SEEMING IRREGULARITIES
1473-135657-0058 IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE WINDS RAIN CLOUDS AND OTHER VARIATIONS OF THE WEATHER ARE SUPPOSED TO BE GOVERNED BY STEADY PRINCIPLES THOUGH NOT EASILY DISCOVERABLE BY HUMAN SAGACITY
1473-135657-0059 NOT ONLY THAT THE CONJUNCTION BETWEEN MOTIVES AND VOLUNTARY ACTIONS IS AS REGULAR AND UNIFORM AS THAT BETWEEN THE CAUSE AND EFFECT IN ANY PART OF NATURE BUT ALSO THAT THIS REGULAR CONJUNCTION HAS BEEN UNIVERSALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AMONG MANKIND AND HAS NEVER BEEN THE SUBJECT OF DISPUTE
1473-135657-0060 OR COMMON LIFE NOW AS IT IS FROM PAST EXPERIENCE THAT WE DRAW ALL INFERENCES CONCERNING THE FUTURE AND AS WE CONCLUDE THAT OBJECTS WILL ALWAYS BE CONJOINED TOGETHER WHICH WE FIND TO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONJOINED IT MAY SEEM SUPERFLUOUS TO PROVE THAT THIS EXPERIENCED UNIFORMITY IN HUMAN ACTIONS
1473-135657-0061 IS A SOURCE WHENCE WE DRAW INFERENCES CONCERNING THEM BUT IN ORDER TO THROW THE ARGUMENT INTO A GREATER VARIETY OF LIGHTS WE SHALL ALSO INSIST THOUGH BRIEFLY ON THIS LATTER TOPIC THE MUTUAL DEPENDENCE OF MEN IS SO GREAT IN ALL SOCIETIES
1473-135657-0062 THAT SCARCE ANY HUMAN ACTION IS ENTIRELY COMPLETE IN ITSELF OR IS PERFORMED WITHOUT SOME REFERENCE TO THE ACTIONS OF OTHERS WHICH ARE REQUISITE TO MAKE IT ANSWER FULLY THE INTENTION OF THE AGENT THE POOREST ARTIFICER WHO LABOURS ALONE EXPECTS AT LEAST THE PROTECTION OF THE MAGISTRATE
1473-135657-0063 TO ENSURE HIM THE ENJOYMENT OF THE FRUITS OF HIS LABOUR HE ALSO EXPECTS THAT WHEN HE CARRIES HIS GOODS TO MARKET AND OFFERS THEM AT A REASONABLE PRICE HE SHALL FIND PURCHASERS AND SHALL BE ABLE BY THE MONEY HE ACQUIRES TO ENGAGE OTHERS TO SUPPLY HIM WITH THOSE COMMODITIES WHICH ARE REQUISITE
1473-135657-0064 FOR HIS SUBSISTENCE IN PROPORTION AS MEN EXTEND THEIR DEALINGS AND RENDER THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH OTHERS MORE COMPLICATED THEY ALWAYS COMPREHEND IN THEIR SCHEMES OF LIFE A GREATER VARIETY OF VOLUNTARY ACTIONS WHICH THEY EXPECT FROM THE PROPER MOTIVES TO CO OPERATE WITH THEIR OWN
1473-135657-0065 AND FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT MEN AS WELL AS ALL THE ELEMENTS ARE TO CONTINUE IN THEIR OPERATIONS THE SAME THAT THEY HAVE EVER FOUND THEM A MANUFACTURER RECKONS UPON THE LABOUR OF HIS SERVANTS FOR THE EXECUTION OF ANY WORK
1473-135657-0066 IN SHORT THIS EXPERIMENTAL INFERENCE AND REASONING CONCERNING THE ACTIONS OF OTHERS ENTERS SO MUCH INTO HUMAN LIFE THAT NO MAN WHILE AWAKE IS EVER A MOMENT WITHOUT EMPLOYING IT
1473-135657-0067 ACCORDING TO THE FOREGOING DEFINITION
1473-135657-0068 FOR NOT TO MENTION THAT ALMOST EVERY ACTION OF THEIR LIFE SUPPOSES THAT OPINION THERE ARE EVEN FEW OF THE SPECULATIVE PARTS OF LEARNING TO WHICH IT IS NOT ESSENTIAL WHAT WOULD BECOME OF HISTORY HAD WE NOT A DEPENDENCE ON THE VERACITY OF THE HISTORIAN
1473-135657-0069 ACCORDING TO THE EXPERIENCE WHICH WE HAVE HAD OF MANKIND HOW COULD POLITICS BE A SCIENCE IF LAWS AND FORMS OF GOVERMENT HAD NOT A UNIFORM INFLUENCE UPON SOCIETY WHERE WOULD BE THE FOUNDATION OF MORALS IF PARTICULAR CHARACTERS HAD NO CERTAIN
1473-135657-0070 OR DETERMINATE POWER TO PRODUCE PARTICULAR SENTIMENTS AND IF THESE SENTIMENTS HAD NO CONSTANT OPERATION ON ACTIONS AND WITH WHAT PRETENCE COULD WE EMPLOY OUR CRITICISM UPON ANY POET OR POLITE AUTHOR
1473-135657-0071 IF WE COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE CONDUCT AND SENTIMENTS OF HIS ACTORS EITHER NATURAL OR UNNATURAL TO SUCH CHARACTERS AND IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
1473-135657-0072 IT SEEMS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THEREFORE TO ENGAGE EITHER IN SCIENCE OR ACTION OF ANY KIND WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING THE DOCTRINE OF NECESSITY AND THIS INFERENCE FROM MOTIVE TO VOLUNTARY ACTIONS FROM CHARACTERS TO CONDUCT AND INDEED
1473-135657-0073 WHEN WE CONSIDER HOW APTLY NATURAL AND MORAL EVIDENCE LINK TOGETHER AND FORM ONLY ONE CHAIN OF ARGUMENT WE SHALL MAKE NO SCRUPLE TO ALLOW THAT THEY ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND DERIVED FROM THE SAME PRINCIPLES
1473-135657-0074 AS WELL WHEN HE CONSIDERS THE OBSTINACY OF THE GAOLER AS THE WALLS AND BARS WITH WHICH HE IS SURROUNDED
1473-135657-0075 THAN UPON THE INFLEXIBLE NATURE OF THE OTHER THE SAME PRISONER WHEN CONDUCTED TO THE SCAFFOLD FORESEES HIS DEATH AS CERTAINLY FROM THE CONSTANCY AND FIDELITY OF HIS GUARDS AS FROM THE OPERATION OF THE AXE OR WHEEL
1473-135657-0076 HIS MIND RUNS ALONG A CERTAIN TRAIN OF IDEAS THE REFUSAL OF THE SOLDIERS TO CONSENT TO HIS ESCAPE THE ACTION OF THE EXECUTIONER THE SEPARATION OF THE HEAD AND BODY BLEEDING CONVULSIVE MOTIONS AND DEATH
1473-135657-0077 HERE IS A CONNECTED CHAIN OF NATURAL CAUSES AND VOLUNTARY ACTIONS BUT THE MIND FEELS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IN PASSING FROM ONE LINK TO ANOTHER NOR IS LESS CERTAIN OF THE FUTURE EVENT THAN IF IT WERE CONNECTED WITH THE OBJECTS PRESENT TO THE MEMORY OR SENSES BY A TRAIN OF CAUSES
1473-135657-0078 CEMENTED TOGETHER BY WHAT WE ARE PLEASED TO CALL A PHYSICAL NECESSITY THE SAME EXPERIENCED UNION HAS THE SAME EFFECT ON THE MIND WHETHER THE UNITED OBJECTS BE MOTIVES VOLITION AND ACTIONS OR FIGURE AND MOTION WE MAY CHANGE THE NAME OF THINGS
1473-135657-0079 NEVER CHANGE WERE A MAN WHOM I KNOW TO BE HONEST AND OPULENT AND WITH WHOM I LIVE IN INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP
1473-135657-0080 I REST ASSURED THAT HE IS NOT TO STAB ME BEFORE HE LEAVES IT IN ORDER TO ROB ME OF MY SILVER STANDISH AND I NO MORE SUSPECT THIS EVENT THAN THE FALLING OF THE HOUSE ITSELF WHICH IS NEW AND SOLIDLY BUILT AND FOUNDED
1473-135657-0081 BUT HE MAY HAVE BEEN SEIZED WITH A SUDDEN AND UNKNOWN FRENZY SO MAY A SUDDEN EARTHQUAKE ARISE AND SHAKE AND TUMBLE MY HOUSE ABOUT MY EARS I SHALL THEREFORE CHANGE THE SUPPOSITIONS I SHALL SAY THAT I KNOW WITH CERTAINTY
1473-135657-0082 THAT HE IS NOT TO PUT HIS HAND INTO THE FIRE AND HOLD IT THERE TILL IT BE CONSUMED AND THIS EVENT I THINK I CAN FORETELL WITH THE SAME ASSURANCE AS THAT
1473-135657-0083 AND MEET WITH NO OBSTRUCTION HE WILL NOT REMAIN A MOMENT SUSPENDED IN THE AIR NO SUSPICION OF AN UNKNOWN FRENZY CAN GIVE THE LEAST POSSIBILITY TO THE FORMER EVENT WHICH IS SO CONTRARY TO ALL THE KNOWN PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN NATURE
1473-135657-0084 A MAN WHO AT NOON LEAVES HIS PURSE FULL OF GOLD ON THE PAVEMENT AT CHARING CROSS
1473-135657-0085 AS THAT HE WILL FIND IT UNTOUCHED AN HOUR AFTER ABOVE ONE HALF OF HUMAN REASONINGS CONTAIN INFERENCES OF A SIMILAR NATURE ATTENDED WITH MORE OR LESS DEGREES OF CERTAINTY PROPORTIONED TO OUR EXPERIENCE OF THE USUAL CONDUCT OF MANKIND
1473-135657-0086 WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE THE REASON WHY ALL MANKIND THOUGH THEY HAVE EVER WITHOUT HESITATION ACKNOWLEDGED THE DOCTRINE OF NECESSITY IN THEIR WHOLE PRACTICE AND REASONING HAVE YET DISCOVERED SUCH A RELUCTANCE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT IN WORDS AND HAVE RATHER SHOWN A PROPENSITY
1473-135657-0087 IN ALL AGES TO PROFESS THE CONTRARY OPINION
1473-135657-0088 BUT THOUGH THIS CONCLUSION CONCERNING HUMAN IGNORANCE BE THE RESULT OF THE STRICTEST SCRUTINY OF THIS SUBJECT
1473-135657-0089 WHEN AGAIN THEY TURN THEIR REFLECTIONS TOWARDS THE OPERATIONS OF THEIR OWN MINDS AND FEEL NO SUCH CONNEXION OF THE MOTIVE AND THE ACTION THEY ARE THENCE APT TO SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EFFECTS WHICH RESULT FROM MATERIAL FORCE
1473-135657-0090 AND THE CONSEQUENT INFERENCE OF THE MIND FROM ONE TO ANOTHER AND FINDING THAT THESE TWO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE UNIVERSALLY ALLOWED TO HAVE PLACE IN VOLUNTARY ACTIONS WE MAY BE MORE EASILY LED TO OWN THE SAME NECESSITY COMMON TO ALL CAUSES
1473-135657-0091 AND THOUGH THIS REASONING MAY CONTRADICT THE SYSTEMS OF MANY PHILOSOPHERS IN ASCRIBING NECESSITY TO THE DETERMINATIONS OF THE WILL WE SHALL FIND UPON REFLECTION THAT THEY DISSENT FROM IT IN WORDS ONLY NOT IN THEIR REAL SENTIMENT
1473-135657-0092 HAS NEVER YET BEEN REJECTED NOR CAN EVER I THINK BE REJECTED BY ANY PHILOSOPHER IT MAY ONLY PERHAPS BE PRETENDED THAT THE MIND CAN PERCEIVE IN THE OPERATIONS OF MATTER SOME FARTHER CONNEXION BETWEEN THE CAUSE AND EFFECT
1473-135657-0093 AND CONNEXION THAT HAS NOT PLACE IN VOLUNTARY ACTIONS OF INTELLIGENT BEINGS NOW WHETHER IT BE SO OR NOT CAN ONLY APPEAR UPON EXAMINATION AND IT IS INCUMBENT ON THESE PHILOSOPHERS TO MAKE GOOD THEIR ASSERTION BY DEFINING OR DESCRIBING THAT NECESSITY
1473-135657-0094 WHEN THEY ENTER UPON IT BY EXAMINING THE FACULTIES OF THE SOUL THE INFLUENCE OF THE UNDERSTANDING AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE WILL LET THEM FIRST DISCUSS A MORE SIMPLE QUESTION NAMELY THE OPERATIONS OF BODY AND OF BRUTE UNINTELLIGENT MATTER
1473-135657-0095 AND TRY WHETHER THEY CAN THERE FORM ANY IDEA OF CAUSATION AND NECESSITY EXCEPT THAT OF A CONSTANT CONJUNCTION OF OBJECTS AND SUBSEQUENT INFERENCE OF THE MIND FROM ONE TO ANOTHER
1473-135657-0096 AND IF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES BE ALSO UNIVERSALLY ACKNOWLEDGED TO TAKE PLACE IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE MIND THE DISPUTE IS AT AN END AT LEAST MUST BE OWNED TO BE THENCEFORTH MERELY VERBAL
1473-135657-0097 BUT AS LONG AS WE WILL RASHLY SUPPOSE THAT WE HAVE SOME FARTHER IDEA OF NECESSITY AND CAUSATION IN THE OPERATIONS OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS
1473-135657-0098 IS THE CONSTANT CONJUNCTION AND INFERENCE ABOVE MENTIONED WE MAY PERHAPS FIND THAT IT IS WITH DIFFICULTY WE ARE INDUCED TO FIX SUCH NARROW LIMITS TO HUMAN UNDERSTANDING BUT WE CAN AFTERWARDS FIND NO DIFFICULTY WHEN WE COME TO APPLY THIS DOCTRINE TO THE ACTIONS OF THE WILL
1473-135657-0099 FOR AS IT IS EVIDENT THAT THESE HAVE A REGULAR CONJUNCTION WITH MOTIVES AND CIRCUMSTANCES AND CHARACTERS AND AS WE ALWAYS DRAW INFERENCES FROM ONE TO THE OTHER WE MUST BE OBLIGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE IN WORDS THAT NECESSITY WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY AVOWED IN EVERY DELIBERATION OF OUR LIVES
1473-135657-0100 OF LIBERTY OR INDIFFERENCE
1473-135657-0101 THE NECESSITY OF ANY ACTION WHETHER OF MATTER OR OF MIND IS NOT PROPERLY SPEAKING A QUALITY IN THE AGENT BUT IN ANY THINKING OR INTELLIGENT BEING WHO MAY CONSIDER THE ACTION AND IT CONSISTS CHIEFLY IN THE DETERMINATION
1473-135657-0102 OF HIS THOUGHTS TO INFER THE EXISTENCE OF THAT ACTION FROM SOME PRECEDING OBJECTS AS LIBERTY WHEN OPPOSED TO NECESSITY IS NOTHING BUT THE WANT OF THAT DETERMINATION AND A CERTAIN LOOSENESS OR INDIFFERENCE WHICH WE FEEL IN PASSING OR NOT PASSING FROM THE IDEA OF ONE OBJECT
1473-135657-0103 TO THAT OF ANY SUCCEEDING ONE NOW WE MAY OBSERVE THAT THOUGH IN REFLECTING ON HUMAN ACTIONS WE SELDOM FEEL SUCH A LOOSENESS OR INDIFFERENCE BUT ARE COMMONLY ABLE TO INFER THEM WITH CONSIDERABLE CERTAINTY FROM THEIR MOTIVES AND FROM THE DISPOSITIONS OF THE AGENT
1473-135657-0104 YET IT FREQUENTLY HAPPENS THAT IN PERFORMING THE ACTIONS THEMSELVES WE ARE SENSIBLE OF SOMETHING LIKE IT AND AS ALL RESEMBLING OBJECTS ARE READILY TAKEN FOR EACH OTHER THIS HAS BEEN EMPLOYED AS A DEMONSTRATIVE AND EVEN INTUITIVE PROOF OF HUMAN LIBERTY
1473-135657-0105 WE FEEL THAT OUR ACTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO OUR WILL ON MOST OCCASIONS AND IMAGINE WE FEEL THAT THE WILL ITSELF IS SUBJECT TO NOTHING BECAUSE WHEN BY A DENIAL OF IT WE ARE PROVOKED TO TRY WE FEEL THAT IT MOVES EASILY EVERY WAY AND PRODUCES AN IMAGE OF ITSELF
1473-135657-0106 EVEN ON THAT SIDE ON WHICH IT DID NOT SETTLE THIS IMAGE OR FAINT MOTION WE PERSUADE OURSELVES COULD AT THAT TIME HAVE BEEN COMPLEATED INTO THE THING ITSELF BECAUSE SHOULD THAT BE DENIED WE FIND UPON A SECOND TRIAL THAT
1473-135657-0107 AT PRESENT IT CAN WE CONSIDER NOT THAT THE FANTASTICAL DESIRE OF SHEWING LIBERTY IS HERE THE MOTIVE OF OUR ACTIONS AND IT SEEMS CERTAIN THAT HOWEVER WE MAY IMAGINE WE FEEL A LIBERTY WITHIN OURSELVES
1473-135657-0108 AND THE MOST SECRET SPRINGS OF OUR COMPLEXION AND DISPOSITION NOW THIS IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF NECESSITY ACCORDING TO THE FOREGOING DOCTRINE
1473-135657-0109 FOR WHAT IS MEANT BY LIBERTY WHEN APPLIED TO VOLUNTARY ACTIONS WE CANNOT SURELY MEAN THAT ACTIONS HAVE SO LITTLE CONNEXION WITH MOTIVES INCLINATIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ONE DOES NOT FOLLOW WITH A CERTAIN DEGREE OF UNIFORMITY FROM THE OTHER
1473-135657-0110 AND THAT ONE AFFORDS NO INFERENCE BY WHICH WE CAN CONCLUDE THE EXISTENCE OF THE OTHER FOR THESE ARE PLAIN AND ACKNOWLEDGED MATTERS OF FACT BY LIBERTY THEN WE CAN ONLY MEAN A POWER OF ACTING OR NOT ACTING ACCORDING TO THE DETERMINATIONS OF THE WILL
1473-135657-0111 THAT IS IF WE CHOOSE TO REMAIN AT REST WE MAY IF WE CHOOSE TO MOVE WE ALSO MAY NOW THIS HYPOTHETICAL LIBERTY IS UNIVERSALLY ALLOWED TO BELONG TO EVERY ONE WHO IS NOT A PRISONER AND IN CHAINS HERE THEN
1473-135657-0112 WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL TO OBSERVE TWO REQUISITE CIRCUMSTANCES FIRST
1473-135657-0113 IT IS UNIVERSALLY ALLOWED THAT NOTHING EXISTS WITHOUT A CAUSE OF ITS EXISTENCE AND THAT CHANCE WHEN STRICTLY EXAMINED IS A MERE NEGATIVE WORD AND MEANS NOT ANY REAL POWER WHICH HAS ANYWHERE A BEING IN NATURE
1473-135657-0114 BUT IT IS PRETENDED THAT SOME CAUSES ARE NECESSARY SOME NOT NECESSARY HERE THEN IS THE ADVANTAGE OF DEFINITIONS LET ANY ONE DEFINE A CAUSE WITHOUT COMPREHENDING AS A PART OF THE DEFINITION
1473-135657-0115 A NECESSARY CONNEXION WITH ITS EFFECT AND LET HIM SHOW DISTINCTLY THE ORIGIN OF THE IDEA EXPRESSED BY THE DEFINITION AND I SHALL READILY GIVE UP THE WHOLE CONTROVERSY BUT IF THE FOREGOING EXPLICATION OF THE MATTER BE RECEIVED
1473-135657-0116 WE SHOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE TERMS FOR THIS IS INDEED ALL WE KNOW OF THE MATTER
