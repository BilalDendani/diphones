359-128761-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUND AND NOW I COME TO PERHAPS THE STRANGEST ADVENTURE THAT HAPPENED TO US IN ALL THIS STRANGE BUSINESS
359-128761-0001 AND ONE WHICH SHOWS HOW WONDERFULLY THINGS ARE BROUGHT ABOUT I WAS WALKING ALONG QUIETLY SOME WAY IN FRONT OF THE OTHER TWO DOWN THE BANKS OF THE STREAM WHICH RUNS FROM THE OASIS TILL IT IS SWALLOWED UP IN THE HUNGRY DESERT SANDS
359-128761-0002 WHEN SUDDENLY I STOPPED AND RUBBED MY EYES AS WELL I MIGHT THERE NOT TWENTY YARDS IN FRONT OF ME PLACED IN A CHARMING SITUATION UNDER THE SHADE OF A SPECIES OF FIG TREE
359-128761-0003 AND FACING TO THE STREAM WAS A COSY HUT BUILT MORE OR LESS ON THE KAFIR PRINCIPLE WITH GRASS AND WITHES BUT HAVING A FULL LENGTH DOOR INSTEAD OF A BEE HOLE
359-128761-0004 EVEN AS I SAID IT THE DOOR OF THE HUT OPENED AND THERE LIMPED OUT OF IT A WHITE MAN CLOTHED IN SKINS AND WITH AN ENORMOUS BLACK BEARD I THOUGHT THAT I MUST HAVE GOT A TOUCH OF THE SUN IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
359-128761-0005 NO HUNTER EVER CAME TO SUCH A PLACE AS THIS CERTAINLY NO HUNTER WOULD EVER SETTLE IN IT I STARED AND STARED AND SO DID THE OTHER MAN AND JUST AT THAT JUNCTURE SIR HENRY AND GOOD WALKED UP
359-128761-0006 LOOK HERE YOU FELLOWS I SAID IS THAT A WHITE MAN OR AM I MAD SIR HENRY LOOKED AND GOOD LOOKED AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE LAME WHITE MAN WITH A BLACK BEARD UTTERED A GREAT CRY
359-128761-0007 AND BEGAN HOBBLING TOWARDS US WHEN HE WAS CLOSE HE FELL DOWN IN A SORT OF FAINT WITH A SPRING SIR HENRY WAS BY HIS SIDE GREAT POWERS HE CRIED
359-128761-0008 IT IS MY BROTHER GEORGE AT THE SOUND OF THIS DISTURBANCE ANOTHER FIGURE ALSO CLAD IN SKINS EMERGED FROM THE HUT A GUN IN HIS HAND AND RAN TOWARDS US
359-128761-0009 MACUMAZAHN HE HALLOED DON'T YOU KNOW ME BAAS I'M JIM THE HUNTER I LOST THE NOTE YOU GAVE ME TO GIVE TO THE BAAS
359-128761-0010 AND THE FELLOW FELL AT MY FEET AND ROLLED OVER AND OVER WEEPING FOR JOY YOU CARELESS SCOUNDREL I SAID YOU OUGHT TO BE WELL SJAMBOCKED THAT IS HIDED MEANWHILE
359-128761-0011 IT WAS EVIDENTLY FORGOTTEN NOW MY DEAR OLD FELLOW BURST OUT SIR HENRY AT LAST I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD I HAVE BEEN OVER SOLOMON'S MOUNTAINS TO FIND YOU
359-128761-0012 I HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF EVER SEEING YOU AGAIN AND NOW I COME ACROSS YOU PERCHED IN THE DESERT LIKE AN OLD ASSVOEGEL
359-128761-0013 I TRIED TO CROSS SOLOMON'S MOUNTAINS NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO WAS THE ANSWER SPOKEN IN THE HESITATING VOICE OF A MAN WHO HAS HAD LITTLE RECENT OPPORTUNITY OF USING HIS TONGUE BUT WHEN I REACHED HERE
359-128761-0014 A BOULDER FELL ON MY LEG AND CRUSHED IT AND I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO NEITHER FORWARD NOR BACK THEN I CAME UP HOW DO YOU DO MISTER NEVILLE I SAID DO YOU REMEMBER ME
359-128761-0015 GEORGE CURTIS TOLD US HIS STORY WHICH IN ITS WAY WAS ALMOST AS EVENTFUL AS OUR OWN AND PUT SHORTLY AMOUNTED TO THIS A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO YEARS BEFORE HE HAD STARTED FROM SITANDA'S KRAAL
359-128761-0016 AS FOR THE NOTE I HAD SENT HIM BY JIM THAT WORTHY LOST IT AND HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF IT TILL TO DAY BUT ACTING UPON INFORMATION HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE NATIVES HE HEADED NOT FOR SHEBA'S BREASTS
359-128761-0017 BUT FOR THE LADDER LIKE DESCENT OF THE MOUNTAINS DOWN WHICH WE HAD JUST COME WHICH IS CLEARLY A BETTER ROUTE THAN THAT MARKED OUT IN OLD DOM SILVESTRA'S PLAN IN THE DESERT HE AND JIM HAD SUFFERED GREAT HARDSHIPS
359-128761-0018 BUT FINALLY THEY REACHED THIS OASIS WHERE A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT BEFELL GEORGE CURTIS ON THE DAY OF THEIR ARRIVAL HE WAS SITTING BY THE STREAM AND JIM WAS EXTRACTING THE HONEY FROM THE NEST OF A STINGLESS BEE
359-128761-0019 WHICH IS TO BE FOUND IN THE DESERT ON THE TOP OF A BANK IMMEDIATELY ABOVE HIM IN SO DOING HE LOOSENED A GREAT BOULDER OF ROCK WHICH FELL UPON GEORGE CURTIS'S RIGHT LEG CRUSHING IT FRIGHTFULLY
359-128761-0020 FROM THAT DAY HE HAD BEEN SO LAME THAT HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GO EITHER FORWARD OR BACK
359-128761-0021 TO THE CERTAINTY OF PERISHING IN THE DESERT AS FOR FOOD HOWEVER THEY GOT ON PRETTY WELL FOR THEY HAD A GOOD SUPPLY OF AMMUNITION AND THE OASIS WAS FREQUENTED ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT BY LARGE QUANTITIES OF GAME
359-128761-0022 WHICH CAME THITHER FOR WATER THESE THEY SHOT OR TRAPPED IN PITFALLS USING THE FLESH FOR FOOD AND AFTER THEIR CLOTHES WORE OUT THE HIDES FOR CLOTHING
359-128761-0023 AND SO GEORGE CURTIS ENDED WE HAVE LIVED FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS LIKE A SECOND ROBINSON CRUSOE AND HIS MAN FRIDAY HOPING AGAINST HOPE THAT SOME NATIVES MIGHT COME HERE TO HELP US AWAY BUT NONE HAVE COME
359-128761-0024 AND NOW YOU OF ALL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD YOU WHO AS I FANCIED HAD LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT ME AND WERE LIVING COMFORTABLY IN OLD ENGLAND TURN UP
359-128761-0025 IN A PROMISCUOUS WAY AND FIND ME WHERE YOU LEAST EXPECTED IT IS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD OF AND THE MOST MERCIFUL TOO THEN SIR HENRY SET TO WORK AND TOLD HIM THE MAIN FACTS OF OUR ADVENTURES
359-128761-0026 SITTING TILL LATE INTO THE NIGHT TO DO IT BY JOVE SAID GEORGE CURTIS WHEN I SHOWED HIM SOME OF THE DIAMONDS WELL AT LEAST YOU HAVE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOUR PAINS BESIDES MY WORTHLESS SELF
359-128761-0027 SIR HENRY LAUGHED THEY BELONG TO QUATERMAIN AND GOOD IT WAS A PART OF THE BARGAIN THAT THEY SHOULD DIVIDE ANY SPOILS THERE MIGHT BE THIS REMARK SET ME THINKING
359-128761-0028 AND HAVING SPOKEN TO GOOD I TOLD SIR HENRY THAT IT WAS OUR JOINT WISH THAT HE SHOULD TAKE A THIRD PORTION OF THE DIAMONDS OR IF HE WOULD NOT THAT HIS SHARE SHOULD BE HANDED TO HIS BROTHER WHO HAD SUFFERED EVEN MORE THAN OURSELVES ON THE CHANCE OF GETTING THEM
359-128761-0029 FINALLY WE PREVAILED UPON HIM TO CONSENT TO THIS ARRANGEMENT BUT GEORGE CURTIS DID NOT KNOW OF IT UNTIL SOME TIME AFTERWARDS
359-128761-0030 BUT WE DID ACCOMPLISH IT SOMEHOW AND TO GIVE ITS DETAILS WOULD ONLY BE TO REPRODUCE MUCH OF WHAT HAPPENED TO US ON THE FORMER OCCASION
359-128761-0031 SIX MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF OUR RE ARRIVAL AT SITANDA'S WHERE WE FOUND OUR GUNS AND OTHER GOODS QUITE SAFE THOUGH THE OLD RASCAL IN CHARGE WAS MUCH DISGUSTED AT OUR SURVIVING TO CLAIM THEM
359-128761-0032 SAW US ALL ONCE MORE SAFE AND SOUND AT MY LITTLE PLACE ON THE BEREA NEAR DURBAN WHERE I AM NOW WRITING
359-128761-0033 A KAFIR CAME UP MY AVENUE OF ORANGE TREES CARRYING A LETTER IN A CLEFT STICK WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT FROM THE POST IT TURNED OUT TO BE FROM SIR HENRY AND AS IT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF I GIVE IT IN FULL
359-128761-0034 FETCHED UP ALL RIGHT IN ENGLAND WE GOT OFF THE BOAT AT SOUTHAMPTON AND WENT UP TO TOWN YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN WHAT A SWELL
359-128761-0035 BEAUTIFULLY SHAVED FROCK COAT FITTING LIKE A GLOVE BRAND NEW EYE GLASS ET CETERA ET CETERA I WENT AND WALKED IN THE PARK WITH HIM WHERE I MET SOME PEOPLE I KNOW AND AT ONCE TOLD THEM THE STORY OF HIS BEAUTIFUL WHITE LEGS
359-128761-0036 HE IS FURIOUS ESPECIALLY AS SOME ILL NATURED PERSON HAS PRINTED IT IN A SOCIETY PAPER TO COME TO BUSINESS GOOD AND I TOOK THE DIAMONDS TO STREETER'S TO BE VALUED AS WE ARRANGED
359-128761-0037 AND REALLY I AM AFRAID TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY PUT THEM AT IT SEEMS SO ENORMOUS
359-128761-0038 AS SUCH STONES HAVE NEVER TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE BEEN PUT ON THE MARKET IN ANYTHING LIKE SUCH QUANTITIES IT APPEARS THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE OR TWO OF THE LARGEST THEY ARE OF THE FINEST WATER
359-128761-0039 AND RECOMMENDED US TO SELL BY DEGREES
359-128761-0040 FOR FEAR LEST WE SHOULD FLOOD THE MARKET THEY OFFER HOWEVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND FOR A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THEM YOU MUST COME HOME QUATERMAIN AND SEE ABOUT THESE THINGS
359-128761-0041 HIS TIME IS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN SHAVING AND OTHER MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE VAIN ADORNING OF THE BODY
359-128761-0042 HE TOLD ME THAT SINCE HE HAD BEEN HOME HE HADN'T SEEN A WOMAN TO TOUCH HER EITHER AS REGARDS HER FIGURE OR THE SWEETNESS OF HER EXPRESSION I WANT YOU TO COME HOME MY DEAR OLD COMRADE
359-128761-0043 YOU CAN FINISH WRITING THE STORY OF OUR ADVENTURES ON BOARD SHIP WE HAVE REFUSED TO TELL THE TALE TILL IT IS WRITTEN BY YOU FOR FEAR LEST WE SHALL NOT BE BELIEVED IF YOU START ON RECEIPT OF THIS
