6395-87997-0000 LETTER FROM ADAM SMITH
6395-87997-0001 DEAR SIR IT IS WITH A REAL THOUGH A VERY MELANCHOLY PLEASURE THAT I SIT DOWN TO GIVE YOU SOME ACCOUNT OF THE BEHAVIOR OF OUR LATE EXCELLENT FRIEND MISTER HUME DURING HIS LAST ILLNESS
6395-87997-0002 THOUGH IN HIS OWN JUDGMENT HIS DISEASE WAS MORTAL AND INCURABLE YET HE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE PREVAILED UPON BY THE ENTREATY OF HIS FRIENDS TO TRY WHAT MIGHT BE THE EFFECTS OF A LONG JOURNEY A FEW DAYS BEFORE HE SET OUT
6395-87997-0003 HE WROTE THAT ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN LIFE WHICH TOGETHER WITH HIS OTHER PAPERS HE HAS LEFT TO YOUR CARE MY ACCOUNT THEREFORE SHALL BEGIN WHERE HIS ENDS HE SET OUT FOR LONDON TOWARDS THE END OF APRIL AND AT MORPETH
6395-87997-0004 EXPECTING TO HAVE FOUND HIM AT EDINBURGH MISTER HOME RETURNED WITH HIM AND ATTENDED HIM DURING THE WHOLE OF HIS STAY IN ENGLAND WITH THAT CARE AND ATTENTION WHICH MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM A TEMPER SO PERFECTLY FRIENDLY AND AFFECTIONATE
6395-87997-0005 AS I HAD WRITTEN TO MY MOTHER THAT SHE MIGHT EXPECT ME IN SCOTLAND I WAS UNDER THE NECESSITY OF CONTINUING MY JOURNEY HIS DISEASE SEEMED TO YIELD TO EXERCISE AND CHANGE OF AIR
6395-87997-0006 THAT EVEN HE HIMSELF BEGAN TO ENTERTAIN WHAT HE WAS NOT APT TO DO A BETTER OPINION OF HIS OWN HEALTH HIS SYMPTOMS HOWEVER SOON RETURNED WITH THEIR USUAL VIOLENCE AND FROM THAT MOMENT
6395-87997-0007 HE GAVE UP ALL THOUGHTS OF RECOVERY BUT SUBMITTED WITH THE UTMOST CHEERFULNESS AND THE MOST PERFECT COMPLACENCY AND RESIGNATION UPON HIS RETURN TO EDINBURGH THOUGH HE FOUND HIMSELF MUCH WEAKER YET HIS CHEERFULNESS NEVER ABATED
6395-87997-0008 AND HE CONTINUED TO DIVERT HIMSELF AS USUAL WITH CORRECTING HIS OWN WORKS FOR A NEW EDITION WITH READING BOOKS OF AMUSEMENT WITH THE CONVERSATION OF HIS FRIENDS AND SOMETIMES IN THE EVENING WITH A PARTY AT HIS FAVORITE GAME OF WHIST
6395-87997-0009 HIS CHEERFULNESS WAS SO GREAT AND HIS CONVERSATION AND AMUSEMENTS RAN SO MUCH IN THEIR USUAL STRAIN THAT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL BAD SYMPTOMS MANY PEOPLE COULD NOT BELIEVE HE WAS DYING I SHALL TELL YOUR FRIEND COLONEL EDMONSTONE
6395-87997-0010 SAID DOCTOR DUNDAS TO HIM ONE DAY THAT I LEFT YOU MUCH BETTER AND IN A FAIR WAY OF RECOVERY DOCTOR SAID HE AS I BELIEVE YOU WOULD NOT CHOOSE TO TELL ANY THING BUT THE TRUTH YOU HAD BETTER TELL HIM
6395-87997-0011 THAT I AM DYING AS FAST AS MY ENEMIES IF I HAVE ANY COULD WISH AND AS EASILY AND CHEERFULLY AS MY BEST FRIENDS COULD DESIRE COLONEL EDMONSTONE SOON AFTERWARDS CAME TO SEE HIM AND TAKE LEAVE OF HIM
6395-87997-0012 AND ON HIS WAY HOME HE COULD NOT FORBEAR WRITING HIM A LETTER BIDDING HIM ONCE MORE AN ETERNAL ADIEU AND APPLYING TO HIM AS TO A DYING MAN THE BEAUTIFUL FRENCH VERSES
6395-87997-0013 IN EXPECTATION OF HIS OWN DEATH LAMENTS HIS APPROACHING SEPARATION FROM HIS FRIEND THE MARQUIS DE LA FARE MISTER HUME'S MAGNANIMITY AND FIRMNESS WERE SUCH THAT HIS MOST AFFECTIONATE FRIENDS KNEW
6395-87997-0014 I TOLD HIM THAT THOUGH I WAS SENSIBLE HOW VERY MUCH HE WAS WEAKENED AND THAT APPEARANCES WERE IN MANY RESPECTS VERY BAD YET HIS CHEERFULNESS WAS STILL SO GREAT
6395-87997-0015 WHEN I LIE DOWN IN THE EVENING I FEEL MYSELF WEAKER THAN WHEN I ROSE IN THE MORNING AND WHEN I RISE IN THE MORNING WEAKER THAN WHEN I LAY DOWN IN THE EVENING I AM SENSIBLE BESIDES
6395-87997-0016 HE SAID THAT HE FELT THAT SATISFACTION SO SENSIBLY THAT WHEN HE WAS READING A FEW DAYS BEFORE LUCIAN'S DIALOGUES OF THE DEAD AMONG ALL THE EXCUSES WHICH ARE ALLEGED TO CHARON
6395-87997-0017 FOR NOT ENTERING READILY INTO HIS BOAT HE COULD NOT FIND ONE THAT FITTED HIM HE HAD NO HOUSE TO FINISH HE HAD NO DAUGHTER TO PROVIDE FOR HE HAD NO ENEMIES UPON WHOM HE WISHED TO REVENGE HIMSELF I COULD NOT WELL IMAGINE SAID HE
6395-87997-0018 WHAT EXCUSE I COULD MAKE TO CHARON IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A LITTLE DELAY I HAVE DONE EVERY THING OF CONSEQUENCE WHICH I EVER MEANT TO DO AND I COULD AT NO TIME EXPECT TO LEAVE MY RELATIONS AND FRIENDS
6395-87997-0019 IN A BETTER SITUATION THAN THAT IN WHICH I AM NOW LIKELY TO LEAVE THEM I THEREFORE HAVE ALL REASON TO DIE CONTENTED HE THEN DIVERTED HIMSELF WITH INVENTING SEVERAL JOCULAR EXCUSES WHICH HE SUPPOSED HE MIGHT
6395-87997-0020 AND WITH IMAGINING THE VERY SURLY ANSWERS WHICH IT MIGHT SUIT THE CHARACTER OF CHARON TO RETURN TO THEM UPON FURTHER CONSIDERATION SAID HE I THOUGHT I MIGHT SAY TO HIM GOOD CHARON
6395-87997-0021 I HAVE BEEN CORRECTING MY WORKS FOR A NEW EDITION ALLOW ME A LITTLE TIME THAT I MAY SEE HOW THE PUBLIC RECEIVES THE ALTERATIONS BUT CHARON WOULD ANSWER WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN THE EFFECT OF THESE
6395-87997-0022 THERE WILL BE NO END OF SUCH EXCUSES SO HONEST FRIEND PLEASE STEP INTO THE BOAT BUT I MIGHT STILL URGE HAVE A LITTLE PATIENCE GOOD CHARON I HAVE BEEN ENDEAVORING TO OPEN THE EYES OF THE PUBLIC IF I LIVE A FEW YEARS LONGER
6395-87997-0023 I MAY HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF SEEING THE DOWNFALL OF SOME OF THE PREVAILING SYSTEMS OF SUPERSTITION BUT CHARON WOULD THEN LOSE ALL TEMPER AND DECENCY YOU LOITERING ROGUE THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN THESE MANY HUNDRED YEARS
6395-87997-0024 OF HIS MAGNANIMITY HE NEVER MENTIONED THE SUBJECT BUT WHEN THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY LED TO IT AND NEVER DWELT LONGER UPON IT THAN THE COURSE OF THE CONVERSATION HAPPENED TO REQUIRE IT WAS A SUBJECT INDEED WHICH OCCURRED PRETTY FREQUENTLY
6395-87997-0025 WHO CAME TO SEE HIM NATURALLY MADE CONCERNING THE STATE OF HIS HEALTH THE CONVERSATION WHICH I MENTIONED ABOVE AND WHICH PASSED ON THURSDAY THE EIGHTH OF AUGUST WAS THE LAST EXCEPT ONE THAT I EVER HAD WITH HIM
6395-87997-0026 THAT THE COMPANY OF HIS MOST INTIMATE FRIENDS FATIGUED HIM FOR HIS CHEERFULNESS WAS STILL SO GREAT HIS COMPLAISANCE AND SOCIAL DISPOSITION WERE STILL SO ENTIRE THAT WHEN ANY FRIEND WAS WITH HIM HE COULD NOT HELP TALKING MORE AND WITH GREATER EXERTION
6395-87997-0027 THAN SUITED THE WEAKNESS OF HIS BODY AT HIS OWN DESIRE THEREFORE I AGREED TO LEAVE EDINBURGH WHERE I WAS STAYING PARTLY UPON HIS ACCOUNT AND RETURNED TO MY MOTHER'S HOUSE HERE AT KIRKALDY
6395-87997-0028 UPON CONDITION THAT HE WOULD SEND FOR ME WHENEVER HE WISHED TO SEE ME THE PHYSICIAN WHO SAW HIM MOST FREQUENTLY DOCTOR BLACK UNDERTAKING IN THE MEAN TIME TO WRITE ME OCCASIONALLY AN ACCOUNT OF THE STATE OF HIS HEALTH
6395-87997-0029 ON THE TWENTY SECOND OF AUGUST THE DOCTOR WROTE ME THE FOLLOWING LETTER SINCE MY LAST MISTER HUME HAS PASSED HIS TIME PRETTY EASILY BUT IS MUCH WEAKER HE SITS UP GOES DOWN STAIRS ONCE A DAY
6395-87997-0030 AND AMUSES HIMSELF WITH READING BUT SELDOM SEES ANY BODY HE FINDS THAT EVEN THE CONVERSATION OF HIS MOST INTIMATE FRIENDS FATIGUES AND OPPRESSES HIM AND IT IS HAPPY THAT HE DOES NOT NEED IT FOR HE IS QUITE FREE FROM ANXIETY
6395-87997-0031 IMPATIENCE OR LOW SPIRITS AND PASSES HIS TIME VERY WELL WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF AMUSING BOOKS I RECEIVED THE DAY AFTER A LETTER FROM MISTER HUME HIMSELF OF WHICH THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXTRACT EDINBURGH
6395-87997-0032 MY DEAREST FRIEND I AM OBLIGED TO MAKE USE OF MY NEPHEW'S HAND IN WRITING TO YOU AS I DO NOT RISE TO DAY I GO VERY FAST TO DECLINE AND LAST NIGHT HAD A SMALL FEVER WHICH I HOPED MIGHT PUT A QUICKER PERIOD
6395-87997-0033 CONCERNING THE DEGREE OF STRENGTH WHICH MAY FROM TIME TO TIME REMAIN WITH ME ADIEU ET CETERA THREE DAYS AFTER I RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM DOCTOR BLACK EDINBURGH MONDAY TWENTY SIXTH AUGUST SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX
6395-87997-0034 DEAR SIR YESTERDAY ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK AFTERNOON MISTER HUME EXPIRED THE NEAR APPROACH OF HIS DEATH BECAME EVIDENT IN THE NIGHT BETWEEN THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WHEN HIS DISEASE BECAME EXCESSIVE
6395-87997-0035 AND SOON WEAKENED HIM SO MUCH THAT HE COULD NO LONGER RISE OUT OF HIS BED HE CONTINUED TO THE LAST PERFECTLY SENSIBLE AND FREE FROM MUCH PAIN OR FEELINGS OF DISTRESS
6395-87997-0036 THAT HE HAD DICTATED A LETTER TO YOU DESIRING YOU NOT TO COME WHEN HE BECAME VERY WEAK IT COST HIM AN EFFORT TO SPEAK AND HE DIED IN SUCH A HAPPY COMPOSURE OF MIND THAT NOTHING COULD EXCEED IT THUS DIED
6395-87997-0037 CONCERNING WHOSE PHILOSOPHICAL OPINIONS MEN WILL NO DOUBT JUDGE VARIOUSLY
6395-87997-0038 OR DISAGREE WITH HIS OWN BUT CONCERNING WHOSE CHARACTER AND CONDUCT
6395-87997-0039 HIS TEMPER INDEED SEEMED TO BE MORE HAPPILY BALANCED IF I MAY BE ALLOWED SUCH AN EXPRESSION
6395-87997-0040 EVEN IN THE LOWEST STATE OF HIS FORTUNE HIS GREAT AND NECESSARY FRUGALITY NEVER HINDERED HIM
6395-87997-0041 IT WAS A FRUGALITY FOUNDED NOT UPON AVARICE BUT UPON THE LOVE OF INDEPENDENCY THE EXTREME GENTLENESS OF HIS NATURE NEVER WEAKENED EITHER THE FIRMNESS OF HIS MIND OR THE STEADINESS OF HIS RESOLUTIONS
6395-87997-0042 HIS CONSTANT PLEASANTRY WAS THE GENUINE EFFUSION OF GOOD NATURE AND GOOD HUMOR TEMPERED WITH DELICACY AND MODESTY AND WITHOUT EVEN THE SLIGHTEST TINCTURE OF MALIGNITY
6395-87997-0043 EVEN THOSE WHO WERE THE OBJECTS OF IT
6395-87997-0044 THE OBJECTS OF IT THERE WAS NOT PERHAPS ANY ONE OF ALL HIS GREAT AND AMIABLE QUALITIES WHICH CONTRIBUTED MORE TO ENDEAR HIS CONVERSATION AND THAT GAYETY OF TEMPER SO AGREEABLE IN SOCIETY
6395-87997-0045 BUT WHICH IS SO OFTEN ACCOMPANIED WITH FRIVOLOUS AND SUPERFICIAL QUALITIES WAS IN HIM CERTAINLY ATTENDED WITH THE MOST SEVERE APPLICATION THE MOST EXTENSIVE LEARNING THE GREATEST DEPTH OF THOUGHT AND A CAPACITY IN EVERY RESPECT THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE
6395-87997-0046 UPON THE WHOLE I HAVE ALWAYS CONSIDERED HIM BOTH IN HIS LIFETIME AND SINCE HIS DEATH AS APPROACHING AS NEARLY TO THE IDEA OF A PERFECTLY WISE AND VIRTUOUS MAN AS PERHAPS THE NATURE OF HUMAN FRAILTY WILL PERMIT I EVER AM DEAR SIR
