4839-15305-0000 HE THOUGHT TO RENDER THE ENTERPRISE EASIER BY NOT BEARING THE WHOLE BURDEN BY HIMSELF ALONE ON THE ELEVENTH OF NOVEMBER FIFTEEN HUNDRED
4839-15305-0001 A TREATY BY WHICH THE KINGS OF FRANCE AND SPAIN DIVIDED BY ANTICIPATION
4839-15305-0002 TERRA DI LAVORO AND THE PROVINCE OF THE ABRUZZI
4839-15305-0003 HE DID NOT HERE AS HE HAD DONE FOR THE CONQUEST OF MILANESS JOIN HIMSELF TO AN ALLY OF FAR INFERIOR POWER TO HIS OWN AND OF AMBITION CONFINED WITHIN FAR NARROWER BOUNDARIES
4839-15305-0004 MEDIOCRE MEN WHO DESIRE TO REMAIN PRETTY NEARLY HONEST HAVE ALWAYS THE WORST OF IT AND ARE ALWAYS DUPES WHEN THEY ALLY THEMSELVES WITH MEN WHO ARE CORRUPT AND AT THE SAME TIME ABLE INDIFFERENT TO GOOD AND EVIL TO JUSTICE AND INIQUITY
4839-15305-0005 HIDDEN OPPOSITION IN THE VERY MIDST OF JOINT ACTION AND AFTERWARDS OPEN TREASON AND DEFECTION HE FORGOT MOREOVER THAT FERDINAND HAD AT THE HEAD OF HIS ARMIES A TRIED CHIEFTAIN GONZALVO OF CORDOVA ALREADY KNOWN THROUGHOUT EUROPE AS THE GREAT CAPTAIN
4839-15305-0006 WHO HAD WON THAT NAME IN CAMPAIGNS AGAINST THE MOORS THE TURKS AND THE PORTUGUESE AND WHO HAD THE CHARACTER OF BEING AS FREE FROM SCRUPLE AS FROM FEAR LASTLY THE SUPPORTERS WHO AT THE VERY COMMENCEMENT OF HIS ENTERPRISES IN ITALY
4839-15305-0007 WERE AS LITTLE TO BE DEPENDED UPON IN THE FUTURE AS THEY WERE COMPROMISING AT THE PRESENT BY REASON OF THEIR REPUTATION FOR UNBRIDLED AMBITION PERFIDY AND CRIME THE KING OF FRANCE WHATEVER SACRIFICES HE MIGHT ALREADY HAVE MADE AND MIGHT STILL MAKE IN ORDER TO INSURE THEIR CO OPERATION COULD NO MORE COUNT UPON IT
4839-15305-0008 FORTIFIED WITH THIS AUTHORITY THE ARMY CONTINUED ITS MARCH AND ARRIVED BEFORE CAPUA ON THE SIXTH OF JULY GONZALVO OF CORDOVA WAS ALREADY UPON NEAPOLITAN TERRITORY WITH A SPANISH ARMY WHICH FERDINAND THE CATHOLIC HAD HASTILY SENT THITHER
4839-15305-0009 AT THE REQUEST OF FREDERICK THREE HIMSELF WHO HAD COUNTED UPON THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS COUSIN THE KING OF ARRAGON AGAINST THE FRENCH INVASION GREAT WAS HIS CONSTERNATION WHEN HE HEARD THAT THE AMBASSADORS OF FRANCE AND SPAIN HAD PROCLAIMED AT ROME THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN THEIR MASTERS
4839-15305-0010 AT THE FIRST RUMOR OF THIS NEWS GONZALVO OF CORDOVA WHETHER SINCERELY OR NOT
4839-15305-0011 BUT SO SOON AS ITS CERTAINTY WAS MADE PUBLIC HE ACCEPTED IT WITHOUT HESITATION AND TOOK EQUALLY WITH THE FRENCH THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE KING ALREADY DETHRONED BY THE POPE AND VERY NEAR BEING SO BY THE TWO SOVEREIGNS WHO HAD MADE ALLIANCE FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHARING BETWEEN THEM
4839-15305-0012 THE SPOIL THEY SHOULD GET FROM HIM CAPUA CAPITULATED AND WAS NEVERTHELESS PLUNDERED AND LAID WASTE A FRENCH FLEET COMMANDED BY PHILIP DE RAVENSTEIN ARRIVED OFF NAPLES WHEN D'AUBIGNY WAS ALREADY MASTER OF IT
4839-15305-0013 HE WOULD WILLINGLY ADVISE HIM AS TO HIS AFFAIRS ACCORDING TO HIS ADVICE THE BEST THING WOULD BE TO SURRENDER AND PLACE HIMSELF IN THE HANDS OF THE KING OF FRANCE AND SUBMIT TO HIS GOOD PLEASURE HE WOULD FIND HIM SO WISE AND SO DEBONNAIR AND SO ACCOMMODATING THAT HE WOULD BE BOUND TO BE CONTENT
4839-15305-0014 BETTER OR SAFER COUNSEL FOR HIM HE HAD NOT TO GIVE AFTER TAKING SOME PRECAUTIONS ON THE SCORE OF HIS ELDEST SON PRINCE FERDINAND WHOM HE LEFT AT TARENTO IN THE KINGDOM HE WAS ABOUT TO QUIT
4839-15305-0015 TWO MONTHS AFTERWARDS AND NOT BEFORE HE WAS CONDUCTED TO THE KING HIMSELF WHO WAS THEN AT BLOIS LOUIS WELCOMED HIM WITH HIS NATURAL KINDNESS AND SECURED TO HIM FIFTY THOUSAND LIVRES A YEAR ON THE DUCHY OF ANJOU
4839-15305-0016 IN GIVING THE SENATE AN ACCOUNT OF HIS MISSION ONE OF THE AMBASSADORS DOMINIC OF TREVISO
4839-15305-0017 AND TEMPERATE IN EATING TAKING SCARCELY ANYTHING BUT BOILED BEEF HE IS BY NATURE MISERLY AND RETENTIVE HIS GREAT PLEASURE IS HAWKING FROM SEPTEMBER TO APRIL HE HAWKS
4839-15305-0018 NOTHING HOWEVER WITH OUT THE COGNIZANCE OF THE KING WHO HAS A FAR FROM STABLE MIND SAYING YES AND NO I AM OF OPINION THAT THEIR LORDSHIPS SHOULD REMOVE EVERY SUSPICION FROM HIS MAJESTY'S MIND AND AIM AT KEEPING THEMSELVES CLOSELY UNITED WITH HIM
4839-15305-0019 IT WAS NOT WITHOUT GROUND THAT THE VENETIAN ENVOY GAVE HIS GOVERNMENT THIS ADVICE
4839-15305-0020 THE KING HAD MORE THAN ONCE FELT AND TESTIFIED SOME DISPLEASURE
4839-15305-0021 BY THE POPE'S NEPHEW CAESAR BORGIA TO WHOM HE HAD GIVEN THE TITLE OF DUKE OF VALENTINOIS
4839-15305-0022 LOUIS ON HIS SIDE SHOWED ANXIETY AS TO THE CONDUCT WHICH WOULD BE EXHIBITED TOWARDS HIM BY THE VENETIANS IF HE ENCOUNTERED ANY EMBARRASSMENT IN HIS EXPEDITION TO NAPLES
4839-15305-0023 THE FRENCH AND THE SPANIARDS D'AUBIGNY AND GONZALVO OF CORDOVA AT FIRST GAVE THEIR ATTENTION TO NOTHING BUT ESTABLISHING THEMSELVES FIRMLY EACH IN THE INTERESTS OF THE KING HIS MASTER IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE KINGDOM WHICH WERE TO BELONG TO THEM BUT BEFORE LONG
4839-15305-0024 DISPUTES AROSE BETWEEN THE TWO GENERALS AS TO THE MEANING OF CERTAIN CLAUSES IN THE TREATY OF NOVEMBER ELEVENTH FIFTEEN HUNDRED
4839-15305-0025 LOUIS D'ARMAGNAC DUKE OF NEMOURS A BRAVE WARRIOR BUT A NEGOTIATOR INCLINED TO TAKE UMBRAGE AND TO GIVE OFFENCE THE DISPUTES SOON TOOK THE FORM OF HOSTILITIES THE FRENCH ESSAYED TO DRIVE THE SPANIARDS FROM THE POINTS THEY HAD OCCUPIED IN THE DISPUTED TERRITORIES
4839-15305-0026 AND AT FIRST THEY HAD THE ADVANTAGE GONZALVO OF CORDOVA FROM NECESSITY OR IN PRUDENCE CONCENTRATED HIS FORCES WITHIN BARLETTA A LITTLE FORTRESS WITH A LITTLE PORT ON THE ADRIATIC
4839-15305-0027 BETWEEN THE KINGS OF SPAIN AND FRANCE MADE A CHANGE IN THE POSITION RECIPROCALLY OF THE TWO SOVEREIGNS AND MUST SUSPEND THE MILITARY OPERATIONS OF THEIR GENERALS WITHIN THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES THE FRENCH GENERAL DECLARED HIS READINESS TO OBEY HIS KING SAYS GUICCIARDINI
4839-15305-0028 BUT THE SPANISH WHETHER IT WERE THAT HE FELT SURE OF VICTORY OR THAT HE HAD RECEIVED PRIVATE INSTRUCTIONS ON THAT POINT SAID THAT HE COULD NOT STOP THE WAR WITHOUT EXPRESS ORDERS FROM HIS KING AND SALLYING FORTHWITH FROM BARLETTA HE GAINED ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF APRIL FIFTEEN O THREE AT CERIGNOLA
4839-15305-0029 HAD ALSO BEATEN ON THE TWENTY FIRST OF APRIL AT SEMINARA A FRENCH CORPS COMMANDED BY D'AUBIGNY THE GREAT CAPTAIN WAS AS EAGER TO PROFIT BY VICTORY AS HE HAD BEEN PATIENT IN WAITING FOR A CHANCE OF IT HE MARCHED RAPIDLY ON NAPLES AND ENTERED IT ON THE FOURTEENTH OF MAY
4839-15305-0030 CAPUA AND AVERSA FOLLOWED ITS EXAMPLE GAETA WAS THE ONLY IMPORTANT PLACE WHICH STILL HELD OUT FOR THE FRENCH AND CONTAINED A GARRISON CAPABLE OF DEFENDING IT AND THITHER THE REMNANT OF THE TROOPS BEATEN AT SEMINARA AND AT CERIGNOLA
4839-15305-0031 THE COMMAND DEVOLVED UPON THE MARQUIS OF MANTUA WHO MARCHED ON GAETA
4839-15305-0032 EITHER TO INVEST THE PLACE OR TO REPULSE RE ENFORCEMENTS THAT MIGHT ARRIVE FOR IT
4839-15305-0033 THE FRENCH ARMY WAS DISPERSING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF SHELTER AND PROVISIONS
4839-15305-0034 GONZALVO WHO WAS KEPT WELL INFORMED OF HIS ENEMIES CONDITION THREW ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF DECEMBER A BRIDGE OVER THE GARIGLIANO
4839-15305-0035 WHICH THEY DID NOT SUCCEED IN ENTERING UNTIL THEY HAD LOST ARTILLERY BAGGAGE AND A NUMBER OF PRISONERS THE SPANIARDS SAYS JOHN D'AUTON HALTED BEFORE THE PLACE MADE AS IF THEY WOULD LAY SIEGE TO IT AND SO REMAINED FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS THE FRENCH WHO WERE THERE IN GREAT NUMBERS
4839-15305-0036 HAD SCARCELY ANY PROVISIONS AND COULD NOT HOLD OUT FOR LONG HOWEVER THEY PUT A GOOD FACE UPON IT THE CAPTAIN GONZALVO SENT WORD TO THEM THAT IF THEY WOULD SURRENDER THEIR TOWN HE WOULD ON HIS PART RESTORE TO THEM WITHOUT RANSOM ALL PRISONERS AND OTHERS OF THEIR PARTY
4839-15305-0037 WOULD SUCCEED HIM AND THAT HOPE HAD A GREAT DEAL TO DO WITH THE SHOCKING FAVOR HE SHOWED CAESAR BORGIA THAT INFAMOUS SON OF A DEMORALIZED FATHER
4839-15305-0038 A FOUR WEEKS POPE PIUS THE THIRD
4839-15305-0039 AND WHEN THE HOLY SEE SUDDENLY BECAME ONCE MORE VACANT
4839-15305-0040 LOUIS CONCLUDED ON THE THIRTY FIRST OF MARCH FIFTEEN O FOUR A TRUCE FOR THREE YEARS WITH THE KING OF SPAIN
4839-15305-0041 IN ORDER TO SATISFY HIS GRUDGE ON ACCOUNT OF THE VENETIANS DEMEANOR TOWARDS HIM
4839-15305-0042 WITH THE DESIGN ALL THREE OF THEM OF WRESTING CERTAIN PROVINCES FROM THEM WITH THOSE POLITICAL MISCALCULATIONS WAS CONNECTED A MORE PERSONAL AND MORE DISINTERESTED FEELING
4839-15305-0043 TO PRINCE CHARLES OF AUSTRIA AND OF THE ENORMOUS CONCESSIONS HE HAD MADE BY TWO TREATIES ONE OF APRIL FIFTH FIFTEEN O THREE AND THE OTHER OF SEPTEMBER TWENTY SECOND FIFTEEN O FOUR FOR THE SAKE OF THIS MARRIAGE HE HAD ASSIGNED AS DOWRY TO HIS DAUGHTER FIRST THE DUCHY OF MILAN
