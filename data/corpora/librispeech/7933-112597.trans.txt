7933-112597-0000 EVERYWHERE THROUGH THE RECORDS WE FIND EVIDENCES THAT THE ANCIENT IRISH BOTH HIGH AND LOW WERE PASSIONATELY FOND OF MUSIC IT WAS MIXED UP WITH THEIR DAILY HOME LIFE AND FORMED PART OF THEIR AMUSEMENTS MEETINGS AND CELEBRATIONS OF EVERY KIND
7933-112597-0001 IN THE RELIGIOUS TALES MUSIC IS ALWAYS ONE OF THE DELIGHTS OF HEAVEN AND A CHIEF FUNCTION OF THE ANGELS WHO ATTEND ON GOD IS TO CHANT MUSIC OF INEFFABLE SWEETNESS TO HIM WHICH THEY GENERALLY DO IN THE SHAPE OF BEAUTIFUL WHITE BIRDS
7933-112597-0002 A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE PEOPLE'S INTENSE FONDNESS FOR MUSIC IS FOUND IN AN OLD IRISH RELIGIOUS POEM IN WHICH THE HARD LOT OF ADAM AND EVE FOR A WHOLE YEAR AFTER THEIR EXPULSION FROM PARADISE IS DESCRIBED WHEN THEY WERE AS THE POEM EXPRESSES IT
7933-112597-0003 WITHOUT PROPER FOOD FIRE HOUSE MUSIC OR RAIMENT HERE MUSIC IS PUT AMONG THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE SO THAT IT WAS A MISERY TO BE WITHOUT IT IN THE EARLY AGES OF THE CHURCH MANY OF THE IRISH ECCLESIASTICS
7933-112597-0004 TOOK DELIGHT IN PLAYING ON THE HARP AND IN ORDER TO INDULGE IN THIS INNOCENT AND REFINING TASTE THEY WERE WONT TO BRING WITH THEM ON THEIR MISSIONARY JOURNEYS A SMALL PORTABLE HARP WITH WHICH THEY BEGUILED MANY A WEARY HOUR AFTER THEIR HARD WORK
7933-112597-0005 IN VERY EARLY TIMES IRISH PROFESSORS OF MUSIC WERE AS EAGERLY SOUGHT AFTER ON THE CONTINENT AS THOSE OF LITERATURE AND GENERAL LEARNING SO THAT THEY WERE SOMETIMES PLACED AT THE HEAD OF GREAT MUSIC SCHOOLS AT A LATER TIME IT WAS QUITE COMMON AMONG THE WELSH BARDS
7933-112597-0006 TO COME OVER TO IRELAND TO RECEIVE INSTRUCTION FROM THE IRISH HARPERS
7933-112597-0007 BROUGHT OVER TO WALES A NUMBER OF SKILLED IRISH MUSICIANS WHO IN CONFERENCE WITH THE NATIVE WELSH BARDS CARRIED OUT SOME GREAT IMPROVEMENTS IN WELSH MUSIC IRELAND WAS LONG THE SCHOOL FOR SCOTTISH HARPERS ALSO WHO REGULARLY CAME OVER LIKE THOSE OF WALES
7933-112597-0008 TO FINISH THEIR MUSICAL EDUCATION A PRACTICE WHICH CONTINUED DOWN TO ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO GIRALDUS CAMBRENSIS A WELSHMAN WHO VISITED IRELAND IN ELEVEN EIGHTY FIVE THOUGH VERY MUCH PREJUDICED AGAINST THE IRISH
7933-112597-0009 SAYS THAT IRISH HARPERS WERE INCOMPARABLY MORE SKILFUL THAN THOSE OF ANY OTHER NATION HE HAD EVER HEARD PLAY
7933-112597-0010 IT IS CONSTANTLY MIXED UP WITH OUR OLDEST LEGENDS AND IT WAS IN USE FROM THE REMOTEST PAGAN TIMES THE OLD IRISH HARPS WERE OF A MEDIUM SIZE OR RATHER SMALL THE AVERAGE HEIGHT BEING ABOUT THIRTY INCHES AND SOME WERE NOT MUCH MORE THAN HALF THAT HEIGHT
7933-112597-0011 THEY HAD STRINGS OF BRASS WIRE WHICH WERE TUNED BY A KEY NOT VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE PRESENT TUNING KEY IRISH HARPERS ALWAYS PLAYED WITH THE FINGERS OR WITH THE FINGER NAILS THE IRISH HAD A SMALL STRINGED INSTRUMENT CALLED A TIMPAN
7933-112597-0012 TO WHICH AT ONE SIDE WAS ATTACHED A SHORT NECK THE STRINGS WERE STRETCHED ACROSS THE FLAT FACE OF THE DRUM AND ALONG THE NECK AND WERE TUNED AND REGULATED BY PINS OR KEYS AND A BRIDGE IT WAS PLAYED WITH A BOW OR WITH THE FINGER NAIL OR BY BOTH TOGETHER
7933-112597-0013 WHILE THE NOTES WERE REGULATED IN PITCH OR STOPPED AS MUSICIANS SAY WITH THE FINGERS OF THE LEFT HAND LIKE THOSE OF A FIDDLE OR GUITAR THIS LITTLE INSTRUMENT WAS A GREAT FAVOURITE AND IS CONSTANTLY MENTIONED IN IRISH LITERATURE
7933-112597-0014 HARPERS AND TIMPANISTS WERE HONOURED IN IRELAND BEYOND ALL OTHER MUSICIANS AND THEIR RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES WERE EVEN LAID DOWN IN THE LAW KINGS HAD ALWAYS HARPERS IN THEIR SERVICE WHO RESIDED IN THE PALACES AND WERE WELL PAID FOR THEIR SERVICES
7933-112597-0015 MANY OF WHOM PLAYED THEM AS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AS PEOPLE NOW PLAY THE PIANO AND GUITAR BUT THE BAGPIPE WAS THE GREAT FAVOURITE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE THE FORM IN USE WAS WHAT WE NOW CALL THE HIGHLAND OR SCOTCH PIPES SLUNG FROM THE SHOULDER THE BAG INFLATED BY THE MOUTH
7933-112597-0016 RESTING ON THE LAP WHEN IN USE AND HAVING THE BAG INFLATED BY A BELLOWS BUT THIS IS A LATE INVENTION THE OLD IRISH HAD ALSO WHISTLES AND FLAGEOLETS WITH HOLES FOR THE FINGERS AND BLOWN BY THE MOUTH MUCH LIKE THOSE OF THE PRESENT DAY
7933-112597-0017 ON MANY OF THE GREAT STONE CROSSES ARE SCULPTURED HARP PLAYERS AND PIPE PLAYERS FROM WHICH WE LEARN A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE SHAPES AND SIZES OF THE SEVERAL INSTRUMENTS THE IRISH HAD CURVED BRONZE TRUMPETS AND HORNS OF VARIOUS SHAPES AND SIZES
7933-112597-0018 WHICH JUDGING FROM THE NUMBERS FOUND BURIED IN CLAY AND BOGS MUST HAVE BEEN IN VERY GENERAL USE IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM IN DUBLIN IS A COLLECTION OF TWENTY SIX ANCIENT TRUMPETS VARYING IN LENGTH FROM EIGHT FEET DOWN TO EIGHTEEN INCHES
7933-112597-0019 THE LARGER ONES ARE OF MOST ADMIRABLE WORKMANSHIP FORMED BY HAMMERING CURVED JOINTED ORNAMENTED AND RIVETED WITH EXTRAORDINARY SKILL AND PERFECTION OF FINISH
7933-112597-0020 AMONG THE HOUSEHOLD OF EVERY KING AND CHIEF THERE WAS A BAND OF TRUMPETERS AS THERE WERE HARPERS WHO WERE ASSIGNED THEIR PROPER PLACES AT FEASTS AND MEETINGS TRUMPETS WERE USED FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES IN WAR IN HUNTING FOR SIGNALS DURING MEETINGS AND BANQUETS
7933-112597-0021 AS A MARK OF HONOUR ON THE ARRIVAL OF DISTINGUISHED VISITORS AND SUCH LIKE FOR WAR PURPOSES TRUMPETERS HAD DIFFERENT CALLS FOR DIRECTING MOVEMENTS FOR BATTLE FOR UNYOKING FOR MARCHING FOR HALTING FOR RETIRING TO SLEEP
7933-112597-0022 A LITTLE BRANCH ON WHICH WERE SUSPENDED A NUMBER OF DIMINUTIVE BELLS WHICH PRODUCED A SWEET TINKLING WHEN SHAKEN A CUSTOM FOUND ALSO IN EARLY TIMES ON THE CONTINENT THE MUSICAL BRANCH FIGURES MUCH IN IRISH ROMANTIC LITERATURE
7933-112597-0023 THE MUSIC OF ANCIENT IRELAND CONSISTED WHOLLY OF SHORT AIRS EACH WITH TWO STRAINS OR PARTS SELDOM MORE BUT THESE THOUGH SIMPLE IN COMPARISON WITH MODERN MUSIC WERE CONSTRUCTED WITH SUCH EXQUISITE ART THAT OF A LARGE PROPORTION OF THEM IT MAY BE TRULY SAID
7933-112597-0024 NO MODERN COMPOSER CAN PRODUCE AIRS OF A SIMILAR KIND TO EQUAL THEM THE IRISH MUSICIANS HAD VARIOUS STYLES THREE OF WHICH ARE VERY OFTEN MENTIONED IN TALES AND OTHER ANCIENT IRISH WRITINGS OF THESE NUMEROUS SPECIMENS HAVE COME DOWN TO THE PRESENT DAY
7933-112597-0025 THE SORROW MUSIC GOLTREE WAS SLOW AND SAD AND WAS ALWAYS SUNG ON THE OCCASION OF A DEATH WE HAVE MANY AIRS BELONGING TO THIS STYLE WHICH ARE NOW COMMONLY CALLED KEENS I E LAMENTS OR DIRGES THE SLEEP MUSIC SUANTREE
7933-112597-0026 WAS INTENDED TO PRODUCE SLEEP AND THE TUNES BELONGING TO THIS STYLE WERE PLAINTIVE AND SOOTHING SUCH AIRS ARE NOW KNOWN AS LULLABIES OR NURSE TUNES OR CRADLE SONGS OF WHICH NUMEROUS EXAMPLES ARE PRESERVED IN COLLECTIONS OF IRISH MUSIC
7933-112597-0027 THERE WERE SPECIAL SPINNING WHEEL SONGS WHICH THE WOMEN SANG WITH WORDS IN CHORUS OR IN DIALOGUE WHEN EMPLOYED IN SPINNING
7933-112597-0028 AT MILKING TIME THE GIRLS WERE IN THE HABIT OF CHANTING A PARTICULAR SORT OF AIR IN A LOW GENTLE VOICE THESE MILKING SONGS WERE SLOW AND PLAINTIVE SOMETHING LIKE THE NURSE TUNES
7933-112597-0029 THIS PRACTICE WAS COMMON DOWN TO FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS AGO AND I WELL REMEMBER SEEING COWS GROW RESTLESS WHEN THE SONG WAS INTERRUPTED AND BECOME AGAIN QUIET AND PLACID WHEN IT WAS RESUMED THE SAME CUSTOM WAS COMMON IN THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND
7933-112597-0030 WHILE PLOUGHMEN WERE AT THEIR WORK THEY WHISTLED A SWEET SLOW AND SAD STRAIN WHICH HAD AS POWERFUL AN EFFECT IN SOOTHING THE HORSES AT THEIR HARD LABOUR AS THE MILKING SONGS HAD ON THE COWS AND THESE PLOUGH WHISTLES ALSO WERE QUITE USUAL TILL ABOUT HALF A CENTURY AGO
7933-112597-0031 SPECIAL AIRS AND SONGS WERE USED DURING WORKING TIME BY SMITHS BY WEAVERS AND BY BOATMEN
7933-112597-0032 EXAMPLES OF ALL THE PRECEDING CLASSES OF MELODIES WILL BE FOUND IN THE COLLECTIONS OF IRISH AIRS BY BUNTING PETRIE AND JOYCE THE IRISH HAD NUMEROUS WAR MARCHES WHICH THE PIPERS PLAYED AT THE HEAD OF THE CLANSMEN WHEN MARCHING TO BATTLE
7933-112597-0033 AND WHICH INSPIRED THEM WITH COURAGE AND DASH FOR THE FIGHT THIS CUSTOM IS STILL KEPT UP BY THE SCOTCH AND MANY FINE BATTLE TUNES ARE PRINTED IN IRISH AND SCOTCH COLLECTIONS OF NATIONAL MUSIC THE MAN WHO DID MOST IN MODERN TIMES TO DRAW ATTENTION TO IRISH MUSIC WAS THOMAS MOORE
