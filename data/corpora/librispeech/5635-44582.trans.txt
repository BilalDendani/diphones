5635-44582-0000 CONCENTRATION IN DELIVERY ATTENTION IS THE MICROSCOPE OF THE MENTAL EYE ITS POWER MAY BE HIGH OR LOW ITS FIELD OF VIEW NARROW OR BROAD WHEN HIGH POWER IS USED ATTENTION IS CONFINED WITHIN VERY CIRCUMSCRIBED LIMITS
5635-44582-0001 THAT THEY CAN NEVER BE EFFACED ATTENTION OF THIS SORT IS THE PRIME CONDITION OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE MENTAL LABOR DANIEL PUTNAM PSYCHOLOGY TRY TO RUB THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD FORWARD AND BACKWARD
5635-44582-0002 AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU ARE PATTING YOUR CHEST UNLESS YOUR POWERS OF COOERDINATION ARE WELL DEVELOPED YOU WILL FIND IT CONFUSING IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE THE BRAIN NEEDS SPECIAL TRAINING BEFORE IT CAN DO TWO OR MORE THINGS EFFICIENTLY AT THE SAME INSTANT
5635-44582-0003 IT MAY SEEM LIKE SPLITTING A HAIR BETWEEN ITS NORTH AND NORTHWEST CORNER BUT SOME PSYCHOLOGISTS ARGUE THAT NO BRAIN CAN THINK TWO DISTINCT THOUGHTS ABSOLUTELY SIMULTANEOUSLY THAT WHAT SEEMS TO BE SIMULTANEOUS
5635-44582-0004 IS REALLY VERY RAPID ROTATION FROM THE FIRST THOUGHT TO THE SECOND AND BACK AGAIN JUST AS IN THE ABOVE CITED EXPERIMENT THE ATTENTION MUST SHIFT FROM ONE HAND TO THE OTHER UNTIL ONE OR THE OTHER MOVEMENT BECOMES PARTLY OR WHOLLY AUTOMATIC WHATEVER IS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRUTH OF THIS CONTENTION
5635-44582-0005 BUT AN EMPHATIC WORD NEEDS EMPHATIC EXPRESSION AND THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT IT DOES NOT GET WHEN CONCENTRATION FLAGS BY LEAPING TOO SOON TO THAT WHICH IS NEXT TO BE UTTERED CONCENTRATE ALL YOUR MENTAL ENERGIES ON THE PRESENT SENTENCE
5635-44582-0006 REMEMBER THAT THE MIND OF YOUR AUDIENCE FOLLOWS YOURS VERY CLOSELY AND IF YOU WITHDRAW YOUR ATTENTION FROM WHAT YOU ARE SAYING TO WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO SAY YOUR AUDIENCE WILL ALSO WITHDRAW THEIRS THEY MAY NOT DO SO CONSCIOUSLY AND DELIBERATELY
5635-44582-0007 BUT THEY WILL SURELY CEASE TO GIVE IMPORTANCE TO THE THINGS THAT YOU YOURSELF SLIGHT IT IS FATAL TO EITHER THE ACTOR OR THE SPEAKER TO CROSS HIS BRIDGES TOO SOON OF COURSE ALL THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT IN THE NATURAL PAUSES OF YOUR SPEECH
5635-44582-0008 THE CAUTION IS OF QUITE ANOTHER SORT WHILE SPEAKING ONE SENTENCE DO NOT THINK OF THE SENTENCE TO FOLLOW LET IT COME FROM ITS PROPER SOURCE WITHIN YOURSELF YOU CANNOT DELIVER A BROADSIDE WITHOUT CONCENTRATED FORCE
5635-44582-0009 THAT IS WHAT PRODUCES THE EXPLOSION IN PREPARATION YOU STORE AND CONCENTRATE THOUGHT AND FEELING IN THE PAUSES DURING DELIVERY YOU SWIFTLY LOOK AHEAD AND GATHER YOURSELF FOR EFFECTIVE ATTACK DURING THE MOMENTS OF ACTUAL SPEECH SPEAK
5635-44582-0010 DON'T ANTICIPATE DIVIDE YOUR ATTENTION AND YOU DIVIDE YOUR POWER THIS MATTER OF THE EFFECT OF THE INNER MAN UPON THE OUTER NEEDS A FURTHER WORD HERE PARTICULARLY AS TOUCHING CONCENTRATION WHAT DO YOU READ MY LORD
5635-44582-0011 DID YOU EVER NOTICE HOW HOLLOW A MEMORIZED SPEECH USUALLY SOUNDS YOU HAVE LISTENED TO THE RANTING MECHANICAL CADENCE OF INEFFICIENT ACTORS LAWYERS AND PREACHERS THEIR TROUBLE IS A MENTAL ONE THEY ARE NOT CONCENTRATEDLY THINKING THOUGHTS

5635-44582-0013 SUCH SPEECHES LOSE NOTHING BY REPETITION FOR THE PERFECTLY PATENT REASON THAT THEY ARISE FROM CONCENTRATED THOUGHT AND FEELING AND NOT A MERE NECESSITY FOR SAYING SOMETHING WHICH USUALLY MEANS ANYTHING AND THAT IN TURN IS TANTAMOUNT TO NOTHING
5635-44582-0014 IF THE THOUGHT BENEATH YOUR WORDS IS WARM FRESH SPONTANEOUS A PART OF YOUR SELF YOUR UTTERANCE WILL HAVE BREATH AND LIFE WORDS ARE ONLY A RESULT DO NOT TRY TO GET THE RESULT WITHOUT STIMULATING THE CAUSE
5635-44582-0015 DO YOU ASK HOW TO CONCENTRATE THINK OF THE WORD ITSELF AND OF ITS PHILOLOGICAL BROTHER CONCENTRIC THINK OF HOW A LENS GATHERS AND CONCENTERS THE RAYS OF LIGHT WITHIN A GIVEN CIRCLE IT CENTERS THEM BY A PROCESS OF WITHDRAWAL
5635-44582-0016 IT MAY SEEM LIKE A HARSH SAYING BUT THE MAN WHO CANNOT CONCENTRATE IS EITHER WEAK OF WILL A NERVOUS WRECK OR HAS NEVER LEARNED WHAT WILL POWER IS GOOD FOR YOU MUST CONCENTRATE BY RESOLUTELY WITHDRAWING YOUR ATTENTION FROM EVERYTHING ELSE
5635-44582-0017 IF YOU CONCENTRATE YOUR THOUGHT ON A PAIN WHICH MAY BE AFFLICTING YOU THAT PAIN WILL GROW MORE INTENSE COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS AND THEY WILL MULTIPLY CENTER YOUR THOUGHT ON YOUR STROKES AND YOUR TENNIS PLAY WILL GRADUALLY IMPROVE
5635-44582-0018 TO CONCENTRATE IS SIMPLY TO ATTEND TO ONE THING AND ATTEND TO NOTHING ELSE IF YOU FIND THAT YOU CANNOT DO THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG ATTEND TO THAT FIRST REMOVE THE CAUSE AND THE SYMPTOM WILL DISAPPEAR
