2785-154284-0000 ANYONE ELSE BUT MC NABBS
2785-154284-0001 IT WAS COVERED WITH SNOW AND SCARCELY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SURROUNDING ROCKS BUT WILSON AND MULRADY SUCCEEDED IN DIGGING IT OUT AND CLEARING THE OPENING AFTER HALF AN HOUR'S HARD WORK TO THE GREAT JOY OF THE WHOLE PARTY
2785-154284-0002 STONE STAIR LED UP TO THE DOOR THE ONLY OPENING AND NARROW AS THIS DOOR WAS THE HURRICANE AND SNOW
2785-154284-0003 WHICH ACCORDING TO THE THERMOMETER WAS TEN DEGREES BELOW ZERO BESIDES THERE WAS A SORT OF FIREPLACE IN IT WITH A CHIMNEY OF BRICKS BADLY ENOUGH PUT TOGETHER CERTAINLY BUT STILL IT ALLOWED OF A FIRE BEING LIGHTED
2785-154284-0004 FOR WE ARE QUITE AS COLD AS WE ARE HUNGRY FOR MY PART I WOULD RATHER SEE A GOOD FAGGOT JUST NOW THAN A SLICE OF VENISON WELL TOM WE'LL TRY AND GET SOME COMBUSTIBLE OR OTHER SAID PAGANEL COMBUSTIBLES
2785-154284-0005 ON THE TOP OF THE CORDILLERAS EXCLAIMED MULRADY IN A DUBIOUS TONE SINCE THERE IS A CHIMNEY IN THE CASUCHA SAID THE MAJOR THE PROBABILITY IS THAT WE SHALL FIND SOMETHING TO BURN IN IT
2785-154284-0006 OUR FRIEND MC NABBS IS RIGHT SAID GLENARVAN GET EVERYTHING IN READINESS FOR SUPPER AND I'LL GO OUT AND TURN WOODCUTTER WILSON AND I WILL GO WITH YOU SAID PAGANEL DO YOU WANT ME ASKED ROBERT GETTING UP
2785-154284-0007 NO MY BRAVE BOY REST YOURSELF YOU'LL BE A MAN WHEN OTHERS ARE ONLY CHILDREN AT YOUR AGE REPLIED GLENARVAN ON REACHING THE LITTLE MOUND OF PORPHYRY GLENARVAN
2785-154284-0008 IN SPITE OF THE PERFECT CALMNESS OF THE ATMOSPHERE THE COLD WAS STINGING PAGANEL CONSULTED HIS BAROMETER AND FOUND THAT THE DEPRESSION OF THE MERCURY CORRESPONDED TO AN ELEVATION OF ELEVEN THOUSAND FEET
2785-154284-0009 ON REACHING A LITTLE MOUND OF PORPHYRY GLENARVAN AND PAGANEL STOPPED TO GAZE ABOUT THEM AND SCAN THE HORIZON ON ALL SIDES THEY WERE NOW ON THE SUMMIT OF THE NEVADAS OF THE CORDILLERAS
2785-154284-0010 AND PEAKS AND GLACIERS FLASHED BACK HIS GOLDEN BEAMS WITH DAZZLING RADIANCE ON THE SOUTH THE VIEW WAS MAGNIFICENT
2785-154284-0011 OF ANTUCO THE MOUNTAIN ROARED LIKE SOME ENORMOUS MONSTER AND VOMITED RED SMOKE MINGLED WITH TORRENTS OF SOOTY FLAME THE SURROUNDING PEAKS APPEARED ON FIRE SHOWERS OF RED HOT STONES
2785-154284-0012 IF THE MORE PRACTICAL WILSON HAD NOT REMINDED THEM OF THE BUSINESS ON HAND THERE WAS NO WOOD TO BE FOUND HOWEVER BUT FORTUNATELY THE ROCKS WERE COVERED WITH A POOR DRY SPECIES OF LICHEN OF THIS THEY MADE AN AMPLE PROVISION
2785-154284-0013 COFFEE WAS SOON READY AND EAGERLY GULPED DOWN BY EVERYBODY THE DRY MEAT CERTAINLY SEEMED POOR FARE AND PAGANEL COULDN'T HELP SAYING I TELL YOU WHAT SOME GRILLED LLAMA WOULDN'T BE BAD WITH THIS WOULD IT
2785-154284-0014 SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF IT IS IN AN ALIMENTARY RESPECT WHAT REPLIED THE MAJOR YOU'RE NOT CONTENT WITH YOUR SUPPER MOST LEARNED PAGANEL ENCHANTED WITH IT MY BRAVE MAJOR
2785-154284-0015 PROBABLY NOT AND IF YOU WERE ASKED TO LIE IN WAIT FOR A LLAMA NOTWITHSTANDING THE COLD AND THE DARKNESS YOU WOULD DO IT WITHOUT THE LEAST HESITATION OF COURSE AND IF IT WILL GIVE YOU THE SLIGHTEST PLEASURE
2785-154284-0016 HIS COMPANIONS HAD HARDLY TIME TO THANK HIM FOR HIS OBLIGING GOOD NATURE WHEN DISTANT AND PROLONGED HOWLS BROKE ON THEIR EAR PLAINLY NOT PROCEEDING FROM ONE OR TWO SOLITARY ANIMALS
2785-154284-0017 THAT IS REGULAR HOWLING LET US GO OUT AND SEE SAID GLENARVAN YES AND BE READY FOR HUNTING REPLIED MC NABBS ARMING HIMSELF WITH HIS CARBINE
2785-154284-0018 SAVE THE FANTASTIC SILHOUETTE OF SOME TOWERING ROCKS HERE AND THERE THE HOWLS AND CLEARLY THE HOWLS OF TERRIFIED ANIMALS WERE REDOUBLED THEY PROCEEDED FROM THAT PART OF THE CORDILLERAS WHICH LAY IN DARKNESS
2785-154284-0019 SUDDENLY A FURIOUS AVALANCHE CAME DOWN AN AVALANCHE OF LIVING ANIMALS MAD WITH FEAR THE WHOLE PLATEAU SEEMED TO TREMBLE THERE WERE HUNDREDS PERHAPS THOUSANDS OF THESE ANIMALS AND IN SPITE OF THE RAREFIED ATMOSPHERE
2785-154284-0020 GLENARVAN MC NABBS ROBERT
2785-154284-0021 HAD JUST TIME TO THROW THEMSELVES FLAT ON THE GROUND BEFORE THEY SWEPT PAST LIKE A WHIRLWIND
2785-154284-0022 LIKE A SMALL CAMEL WITHOUT A HUMP THE HEAD WAS SMALL AND THE BODY FLATTENED THE LEGS WERE LONG AND SLENDER THE SKIN FINE AND THE HAIR THE COLOR OF CAFE AU LAIT PAGANEL HAD SCARCELY LOOKED AT IT BEFORE HE EXCLAIMED A GUANACO
2785-154284-0023 WHAT SORT OF AN ANIMAL IS THAT ASKED GLENARVAN ONE YOU CAN EAT AND IT IS GOOD SAVORY MEAT I ASSURE YOU A DISH OF OLYMPUS I KNEW WE SHOULD HAVE FRESH MEAT FOR SUPPER AND SUCH MEAT
2785-154284-0024 ASKED ROBERT I SHOULD THINK SO MY BOY I'M A FRENCHMAN AND IN EVERY FRENCHMAN THERE IS A COOK FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARD PAGANEL BEGAN TO GRILL
2785-154284-0025 AND IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES A DISH WAS READY WHICH HE SERVED UP TO HIS COMPANIONS BY THE TEMPTING NAME OF GUANACO CUTLETS NO ONE STOOD ON CEREMONY BUT FELL TO WITH A HEARTY GOOD WILL
2785-154284-0026 THE FIRST MOUTHFUL WAS GREETED WITH A GENERAL GRIMACE AND SUCH EXCLAMATIONS AS TOUGH IT IS HORRIBLE
2785-154284-0027 THE POOR SAVANT WAS OBLIGED TO OWN THAT HIS CUTLETS COULD NOT BE RELISHED EVEN BY HUNGRY MEN THEY BEGAN TO BANTER HIM ABOUT HIS OLYMPIAN DISH AND INDULGE IN JOKES AT HIS EXPENSE
2785-154284-0028 BUT ALL HE CARED ABOUT WAS TO FIND OUT HOW IT HAPPENED THAT THE FLESH OF THE GUANACO WHICH WAS CERTAINLY GOOD AND EATABLE FOOD HAD TURNED OUT SO BADLY IN HIS HANDS AT LAST LIGHT BROKE IN ON HIM AND HE CALLED OUT
2785-154284-0029 HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED TOM AUSTIN I MEAN THIS THE GUANACO IS ONLY GOOD FOR EATING WHEN IT IS KILLED IN A STATE OF REST IF IT HAS BEEN LONG HUNTED
2785-154284-0030 ASKED GLENARVAN ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN BUT WHAT COULD HAVE FRIGHTENED THE CREATURES SO AND DRIVEN THEM FROM THEIR HAUNTS WHEN THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN QUIETLY SLEEPING THAT'S A QUESTION MY DEAR GLENARVAN
2785-154284-0031 AND THE FIRE WAS MADE UP FOR THE NIGHT LOUD SNORES IN EVERY TUNE AND KEY SOON RESOUNDED FROM ALL SIDES OF THE HUT THE DEEP BASS CONTRIBUTION OF PAGANEL COMPLETING THE HARMONY BUT GLENARVAN COULD NOT SLEEP
2785-154284-0032 THEN HIS PRESENTIMENTS RETURNED IN GREATER STRENGTH THAN BEFORE AND HE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY TO THE SOUNDS OUTSIDE THE HUT AT CERTAIN INTERVALS HE FANCIED HE COULD HEAR RUMBLING NOISES IN THE DISTANCE DULL AND THREATENING LIKE THE MUTTER INGS
2785-154284-0033 THERE SURELY MUST BE A STORM RAGING DOWN BELOW AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS HE GOT UP AND WENT OUT TO SEE THE MOON WAS RISING THE ATMOSPHERE WAS PURE AND CALM NOT A CLOUD VISIBLE EITHER ABOVE OR BELOW
2785-154284-0034 THEY SEEMED TO MEET TOGETHER AND CROSS THE CHAIN OF THE ANDES GLENARVAN RETURNED TO THE CASUCHA
2785-154284-0035 HIMSELF AS TO THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THESE SOUNDS AND THE FLIGHT OF THE GUANACOS HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND FOUND THE TIME WAS ABOUT TWO IN THE MORNING AS HE HAD NO CERTAINTY HOWEVER OF ANY IMMEDIATE DANGER
2785-154284-0036 HE FELT THE GROUND GIVING WAY BENEATH HIM AND THE CASUCHA ROCKED TO AND FRO AND OPENED HE SHOUTED TO HIS COMPANIONS BUT THEY WERE ALREADY AWAKE AND TUMBLING PELL MELL OVER EACH OTHER
2785-154284-0037 AS IF SOME TRAP HAD OPENED AT THEIR BASE OWING TO A PECULIAR PHENOMENON OF THE CORDILLERAS AN ENORMOUS MASS MANY MILES IN EXTENT HAD BEEN DISPLACED ENTIRELY
2785-154284-0038 AND WAS SPEEDING DOWN TOWARD THE PLAIN AN EARTHQUAKE EXCLAIMED PAGANEL HE WAS NOT MISTAKEN IT WAS ONE OF THOSE CATACLYSMS FREQUENT IN CHILI AND IN THIS VERY REGION WHERE
2785-154284-0039 HOLDING ON BY TUFTS OF LICHEN AND GIDDY AND TERRIFIED IN THE EXTREME WAS RUSHING DOWN THE DECLIVITY WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF AN EXPRESS AT THE RATE OF FIFTY MILES AN HOUR NOT A CRY WAS POSSIBLE
2785-154284-0040 NOR AN ATTEMPT TO GET OFF OR STOP THEY COULD NOT EVEN HAVE HEARD THEMSELVES SPEAK
2785-154284-0041 THE FALL OF MASSES OF GRANITE AND BASALT AND THE WHIRLWIND OF PULVERIZED SNOW MADE ALL COMMUNICATION IMPOSSIBLE SOMETIMES THEY WENT PERFECTLY SMOOTHLY ALONG WITHOUT JOLTS OR JERKS AND SOMETIMES
2785-154284-0042 AS IF WITH THE KEEN EDGE OF AN IMMENSE SCYTHE EVERY PROJECTION OF THE DECLIVITY HOW LONG THIS INDESCRIBABLE DESCENT WOULD LAST NO ONE COULD CALCULATE NOR WHAT IT WOULD END IN ULTIMATELY
2785-154284-0043 NONE OF THE PARTY KNEW WHETHER THE REST WERE STILL ALIVE WHETHER ONE OR ANOTHER WERE NOT ALREADY LYING IN THE DEPTHS OF SOME ABYSS ALMOST BREATHLESS WITH THE SWIFT MOTION FROZEN WITH THE COLD AIR
2785-154284-0044 A TREMENDOUS SHOCK PITCHED THEM RIGHT OFF AND SENT THEM ROLLING TO THE VERY FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THE PLATEAU HAD STOPPED FOR SOME MINUTES NO ONE STIRRED AT LAST ONE OF THE PARTY PICKED HIMSELF UP
