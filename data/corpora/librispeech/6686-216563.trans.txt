6686-216563-0000 THE READER PERHAPS HAS NOT FORGOTTEN WHAT WAS SAID IN THE THIRD CHAPTER CONCERNING THE DIVISION OF LABOR AND THE SPECIALITY OF TALENTS
6686-216563-0001 AND THEIR NATURE IS ALWAYS SIMILAR WE ARE ALL BORN POETS MATHEMATICIANS PHILOSOPHERS ARTISTS ARTISANS OR FARMERS BUT WE ARE NOT BORN EQUALLY ENDOWED AND BETWEEN ONE MAN AND ANOTHER IN SOCIETY
6686-216563-0002 OR BETWEEN ONE FACULTY AND ANOTHER IN THE SAME INDIVIDUAL THERE IS AN INFINITE DIFFERENCE THIS DIFFERENCE OF DEGREE IN THE SAME FACULTIES THIS PREDOMINANCE OF TALENT IN CERTAIN DIRECTIONS IS WE HAVE SAID THE VERY FOUNDATION OF OUR SOCIETY
6686-216563-0003 INTELLIGENCE AND NATURAL GENIUS HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED BY NATURE SO ECONOMICALLY AND YET SO LIBERALLY THAT IN SOCIETY THERE IS NO DANGER OF EITHER A SURPLUS OR A SCARCITY OF SPECIAL TALENTS AND THAT EACH LABORER BY DEVOTING HIMSELF TO HIS FUNCTION
6686-216563-0004 MAY ALWAYS ATTAIN TO THE DEGREE OF PROFICIENCY NECESSARY TO ENABLE HIM TO BENEFIT BY THE LABORS AND DISCOVERIES OF HIS FELLOWS OWING TO THIS SIMPLE AND WISE PRECAUTION OF NATURE THE LABORER IS NOT ISOLATED BY HIS TASK
6686-216563-0005 HE COMMUNICATES WITH HIS FELLOWS THROUGH THE MIND BEFORE HE IS UNITED WITH THEM IN HEART SO THAT WITH HIM LOVE IS BORN OF INTELLIGENCE IT IS NOT SO WITH SOCIETIES OF ANIMALS
6686-216563-0006 THE APTITUDES OF ALL THE INDIVIDUALS THOUGH VERY LIMITED ARE EQUAL IN NUMBER AND WHEN THEY ARE NOT THE RESULT OF INSTINCT IN INTENSITY
6686-216563-0007 PROVIDES HIS FOOD AVOIDS THE ENEMY BURROWS IN THE EARTH
6686-216563-0008 NO ANIMAL WHEN FREE AND HEALTHY EXPECTS OR REQUIRES THE AID OF HIS NEIGHBOR WHO IN HIS TURN IS EQUALLY INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATED ANIMALS LIVE SIDE BY SIDE WITHOUT ANY INTELLECTUAL INTERCOURSE OR INTIMATE COMMUNICATION
6686-216563-0009 ALL DOING THE SAME THINGS HAVING NOTHING TO LEARN OR TO REMEMBER THEY SEE FEEL AND COME IN CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER BUT NEVER PENETRATE EACH OTHER MAN CONTINUALLY EXCHANGES WITH MAN IDEAS AND FEELINGS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
6686-216563-0010 EVERY DISCOVERY AND ACT IN SOCIETY IS NECESSARY TO HIM BUT OF THIS IMMENSE QUANTITY OF PRODUCTS AND IDEAS THAT WHICH EACH ONE HAS TO PRODUCE AND ACQUIRE FOR HIMSELF IS BUT AN ATOM IN THE SUN
6686-216563-0011 AND SOCIETY IS SUPPORTED BY THE BALANCE AND HARMONY OF THE POWERS WHICH COMPOSE IT SOCIETY AMONG THE ANIMALS IS SIMPLE WITH MAN IT IS COMPLEX MAN IS ASSOCIATED WITH MAN BY THE SAME INSTINCT WHICH ASSOCIATES ANIMAL WITH ANIMAL
6686-216563-0012 BUT MAN IS ASSOCIATED DIFFERENTLY FROM THE ANIMAL AND IT IS THIS DIFFERENCE IN ASSOCIATION WHICH CONSTITUTES THE DIFFERENCE IN MORALITY I HAVE PROVED AT TOO GREAT LENGTH PERHAPS
6686-216563-0013 BOTH BY THE SPIRIT OF THE LAWS WHICH REGARD PROPERTY AS THE BASIS OF SOCIETY AND BY POLITICAL ECONOMY THAT INEQUALITY OF CONDITIONS IS JUSTIFIED NEITHER BY PRIORITY OF OCCUPATION NOR SUPERIORITY OF TALENT SERVICE INDUSTRY AND CAPACITY
6686-216563-0014 BUT ALTHOUGH EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS IS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF NATURAL RIGHT OF LIBERTY OF THE LAWS OF PRODUCTION OF THE CAPACITY OF PHYSICAL NATURE AND OF THE PRINCIPLE OF SOCIETY ITSELF
6686-216563-0015 IT DOES NOT PREVENT THE SOCIAL SENTIMENT FROM STEPPING OVER THE BOUNDARIES OF DEBT AND CREDIT THE FIELDS OF BENEVOLENCE AND LOVE EXTEND FAR BEYOND AND WHEN ECONOMY HAS ADJUSTED ITS BALANCE THE MIND BEGINS TO BENEFIT BY ITS OWN JUSTICE
6686-216563-0016 AND THE HEART EXPANDS IN THE BOUNDLESSNESS OF ITS AFFECTION THE SOCIAL SENTIMENT THEN TAKES ON A NEW CHARACTER WHICH VARIES WITH DIFFERENT PERSONS IN THE STRONG IT BECOMES THE PLEASURE OF GENEROSITY
6686-216563-0017 AMONG EQUALS FRANK AND CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP IN THE WEAK THE PLEASURE OF ADMIRATION AND GRATITUDE THE MAN WHO IS SUPERIOR IN STRENGTH SKILL OR COURAGE KNOWS THAT HE OWES ALL THAT HE IS TO SOCIETY
6686-216563-0018 WITHOUT WHICH HE COULD NOT EXIST HE KNOWS THAT IN TREATING HIM PRECISELY AS IT DOES THE LOWEST OF ITS MEMBERS SOCIETY DISCHARGES ITS WHOLE DUTY TOWARDS HIM BUT HE DOES NOT UNDERRATE HIS FACULTIES HE IS NO LESS CONSCIOUS OF HIS POWER AND GREATNESS
6686-216563-0019 AND IT IS THIS VOLUNTARY REVERENCE WHICH HE PAYS TO HUMANITY THIS AVOWAL THAT HE IS BUT AN INSTRUMENT OF NATURE WHO IS ALONE WORTHY OF GLORY AND WORSHIP IT IS I SAY THIS SIMULTANEOUS CONFESSION OF THE HEART AND THE MIND
6686-216563-0020 THIS GENUINE ADORATION OF THE GREAT BEING THAT DISTINGUISHES AND ELEVATES MAN AND LIFTS HIM TO A DEGREE OF SOCIAL MORALITY TO WHICH THE BEAST IS POWERLESS TO ATTAIN HERCULES DESTROYING THE MONSTERS AND PUNISHING BRIGANDS
6686-216563-0021 FOR THE SAFETY OF GREECE ORPHEUS TEACHING THE ROUGH AND WILD PELASGIANS NEITHER OF THEM PUTTING A PRICE UPON THEIR SERVICES THERE WE SEE THE NOBLEST CREATIONS OF POETRY THE LOFTIEST EXPRESSION OF JUSTICE AND VIRTUE
6686-216563-0022 THE JOYS OF SELF SACRIFICE ARE INEFFABLE IF I WERE TO COMPARE HUMAN SOCIETY TO THE OLD GREEK TRAGEDIES I SHOULD SAY THAT THE PHALANX OF NOBLE MINDS AND LOFTY SOULS DANCES THE STROPHE
6686-216563-0023 AND THE HUMBLE MULTITUDE THE ANTISTROPHE BURDENED WITH PAINFUL AND DISAGREEABLE TASKS BUT RENDERED OMNIPOTENT BY THEIR NUMBER AND THE HARMONIC ARRANGEMENT OF THEIR FUNCTIONS THE LATTER EXECUTE WHAT THE OTHERS PLAN GUIDED BY THEM
6686-216563-0024 THEY OWE THEM NOTHING THEY HONOR THEM HOWEVER AND LAVISH UPON THEM PRAISE AND APPROBATION GRATITUDE FILLS PEOPLE WITH ADORATION AND ENTHUSIASM BUT EQUALITY DELIGHTS MY HEART
6686-216563-0025 AND ADMIRATION INTO SERVILITY FRIENDSHIP IS THE DAUGHTER OF EQUALITY O MY FRIENDS MAY I LIVE IN YOUR MIDST WITHOUT EMULATION AND WITHOUT GLORY LET EQUALITY BRING US TOGETHER AND FATE ASSIGN US OUR PLACES
6686-216563-0026 MAY I DIE WITHOUT KNOWING TO WHOM AMONG YOU I OWE THE MOST ESTEEM FRIENDSHIP IS PRECIOUS TO THE HEARTS OF THE CHILDREN OF MEN GENEROSITY GRATITUDE
6686-216563-0027 IT SUPERADDS ESTEEM AND THEREBY FORMS IN MAN A THIRD DEGREE OF SOCIABILITY
6686-216563-0028 AND TO MAKE THEM OUR EQUALS TO PAY TO THE STRONG A JUST TRIBUTE OF GRATITUDE AND HONOR WITHOUT ENSLAVING OURSELVES TO THEM TO CHERISH OUR NEIGHBORS FRIENDS AND EQUALS FOR THAT WHICH WE RECEIVE FROM THEM EVEN BY RIGHT OF EXCHANGE
6686-216563-0029 OR POLITENESS WHICH AMONG CERTAIN NATIONS SUMS UP IN A SINGLE WORD NEARLY ALL THE SOCIAL DUTIES IT IS THE JUST DISTRIBUTION OF SOCIAL SYMPATHY AND UNIVERSAL LOVE NOW THIS FEELING IS UNKNOWN AMONG THE BEASTS
6686-216563-0030 WHO LOVE AND CLING TO EACH OTHER AND SHOW THEIR PREFERENCES BUT WHO CANNOT CONCEIVE OF ESTEEM AND WHO ARE INCAPABLE OF GENEROSITY ADMIRATION OR POLITENESS THIS FEELING DOES NOT SPRING FROM INTELLIGENCE WHICH CALCULATES COMPUTES AND BALANCES
6686-216563-0031 BUT DOES NOT LOVE WHICH SEES BUT DOES NOT FEEL AS JUSTICE IS THE PRODUCT OF SOCIAL INSTINCT AND REFLECTION COMBINED
6686-216563-0032 THAT IS OF OUR POWERS OF JUDGING AND OF IDEALIZING THIS PRODUCT THE THIRD AND LAST DEGREE OF HUMAN SOCIABILITY IS DETERMINED BY OUR COMPLEX MODE OF ASSOCIATION IN WHICH INEQUALITY
6686-216563-0033 OR RATHER THE DIVERGENCE OF FACULTIES AND THE SPECIALITY OF FUNCTIONS TENDING OF THEMSELVES TO ISOLATE LABORERS DEMAND A MORE ACTIVE SOCIABILITY THAT IS WHY THE FORCE WHICH OPPRESSES WHILE PROTECTING IS EXECRABLE
6686-216563-0034 WHY THE SILLY IGNORANCE WHICH VIEWS WITH THE SAME EYE THE MARVELS OF ART AND THE PRODUCTS OF THE RUDEST INDUSTRY EXCITES UNUTTERABLE CONTEMPT WHY PROUD MEDIOCRITY WHICH GLORIES IN SAYING I HAVE PAID YOU I OWE YOU NOTHING
6686-216563-0035 IS ESPECIALLY ODIOUS SOCIABILITY JUSTICE
6686-216563-0036 SUCH IN ITS TRIPLICITY IS THE EXACT DEFINITION OF THE INSTINCTIVE FACULTY WHICH LEADS US INTO COMMUNICATION WITH OUR FELLOWS AND WHOSE PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION IS EXPRESSED BY THE FORMULA EQUALITY IN NATURAL WEALTH AND THE PRODUCTS OF LABOR
6686-216563-0037 THESE THREE DEGREES OF SOCIABILITY SUPPORT AND IMPLY EACH OTHER
6686-216563-0038 SOCIETY WITHOUT JUSTICE IS A SOLECISM IF IN ORDER TO REWARD TALENT I TAKE FROM ONE TO GIVE TO ANOTHER IN UNJUSTLY STRIPPING THE FIRST I DO NOT ESTEEM HIS TALENT AS I OUGHT IF IN SOCIETY
6686-216563-0039 I AWARD MORE TO MYSELF THAN TO MY ASSOCIATE WE ARE NOT REALLY ASSOCIATED JUSTICE IS SOCIABILITY AS MANIFESTED IN THE DIVISION OF MATERIAL THINGS SUSCEPTIBLE OF WEIGHT AND MEASURE
6686-216563-0040 THINGS WHICH CANNOT BE MEASURED FROM THIS SEVERAL INFERENCES MAY BE DRAWN ONE THOUGH WE ARE FREE TO GRANT OUR ESTEEM TO ONE MORE THAN TO ANOTHER AND IN ALL POSSIBLE DEGREES
6686-216563-0041 YET WE SHOULD GIVE NO ONE MORE THAN HIS PROPORTION OF THE COMMON WEALTH BECAUSE THE DUTY OF JUSTICE
6686-216563-0042 MUST ALWAYS TAKE PRECEDENCE OF IT THE WOMAN HONORED BY THE ANCIENTS WHO WHEN FORCED BY A TYRANT TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE DEATH OF HER BROTHER AND THAT OF HER HUSBAND SACRIFICED THE LATTER ON THE GROUND THAT SHE COULD FIND ANOTHER HUSBAND BUT NOT ANOTHER BROTHER THAT WOMAN I SAY
6686-216563-0043 BECAUSE CONJUGAL ASSOCIATION IS A CLOSER RELATION THAN FRATERNAL ASSOCIATION AND BECAUSE THE LIFE OF OUR NEIGHBOR IS NOT OUR PROPERTY BY THE SAME PRINCIPLE INEQUALITY OF WAGES CANNOT BE ADMITTED BY LAW ON THE GROUND OF INEQUALITY OF TALENTS
6686-216563-0044 BECAUSE THE JUST DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH IS THE FUNCTION OF ECONOMY NOT OF ENTHUSIASM FINALLY AS REGARDS DONATIONS WILLS AND INHERITANCE SOCIETY CAREFUL BOTH OF THE PERSONAL AFFECTIONS AND ITS OWN RIGHTS
6686-216563-0045 MUST NEVER PERMIT LOVE AND PARTIALITY TO DESTROY JUSTICE
6686-216563-0046 AND THOUGH THE HEIR SHOULD BE ALLOWED THE RIGHT OF CHOICE IN CASE OF MORE THAN ONE INHERITANCE NEVERTHELESS SOCIETY CAN TOLERATE NO CONCENTRATION OF CAPITAL AND INDUSTRY FOR THE BENEFIT OF A SINGLE MAN NO MONOPOLY OF LABOR NO ENCROACHMENT
6686-216563-0047 TAKEN FROM THE ENEMY AND EQUAL TO TWELVE
6686-216563-0048 IF THE TWO PERSONS WERE EQUAL THEIR RESPECTIVE SHARES WOULD BE ARITHMETICALLY EQUAL ACHILLES WOULD HAVE SIX
6686-216563-0049 AND IF WE SHOULD CARRY OUT THIS ARITHMETICAL EQUALITY
6686-216563-0050 WHICH WOULD BE UNJUST IN THE EXTREME TO AVOID THIS INJUSTICE THE WORTH OF THE PERSONS SHOULD BE ESTIMATED AND THE SPOILS DIVIDED ACCORDINGLY
6686-216563-0051 THE FORMER'S SHARE IS EIGHT THE LATTER FOUR THERE IS NO ARITHMETICAL EQUALITY BUT A PROPORTIONAL EQUALITY
6686-216563-0052 IT IS A GEOMETRICAL PROPORTION
6686-216563-0053 SETTLE THAT AND YOU SETTLE THE WHOLE QUESTION
6686-216563-0054 INSTEAD OF BEING ASSOCIATED ARE THEMSELVES IN THE SERVICE OF AGAMEMNON WHO PAYS THEM THERE IS NO OBJECTION TO ARISTOTLE'S METHOD THE SLAVE OWNER WHO CONTROLS HIS SLAVES MAY GIVE A DOUBLE ALLOWANCE OF BRANDY TO HIM WHO DOES DOUBLE WORK
6686-216563-0055 THAT IS THE LAW OF DESPOTISM THE RIGHT OF SLAVERY
6686-216563-0056 THEY ARE EQUALS WHAT MATTERS IT THAT ACHILLES HAS A STRENGTH OF FOUR
6686-216563-0057 THE LATTER MAY ALWAYS ANSWER THAT HE IS FREE THAT IF ACHILLES HAS A STRENGTH OF FOUR FIVE COULD KILL HIM FINALLY THAT IN DOING PERSONAL SERVICE HE INCURS AS GREAT A RISK AS ACHILLES
6686-216563-0058 IF HE IS UNABLE TO FIGHT LET HIM BE COOK PURVEYOR OR BUTLER IF HE IS GOOD FOR NOTHING PUT HIM IN THE HOSPITAL IN NO CASE WRONG HIM OR IMPOSE UPON HIM LAWS MAN MUST LIVE IN ONE OF TWO STATES
6686-216563-0059 EITHER IN SOCIETY OR OUT OF IT IN SOCIETY CONDITIONS ARE NECESSARILY EQUAL EXCEPT IN THE DEGREE OF ESTEEM AND CONSIDERATION WHICH EACH ONE MAY RECEIVE OUT OF SOCIETY MAN IS SO MUCH RAW MATERIAL
6686-216563-0060 A CAPITALIZED TOOL AND OFTEN AN INCOMMODIOUS AND USELESS PIECE OF FURNITURE TWO
6686-216563-0061 CAN EXIST ONLY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS OF THE SAME SPECIES THEY FORM NO PART OF THE RELATIONS OF DIFFERENT RACES TO EACH OTHER FOR INSTANCE OF THE WOLF TO THE GOAT OF THE GOAT TO MAN OF MAN TO GOD MUCH LESS OF GOD TO MAN
6686-216563-0062 AND THE ADJECTIVES JUST MERCIFUL PITIFUL AND THE LIKE SHOULD BE STRICKEN FROM OUR LITANIES GOD CAN BE REGARDED AS JUST EQUITABLE AND GOOD ONLY TO ANOTHER GOD NOW GOD HAS NO ASSOCIATE
6686-216563-0063 CONSEQUENTLY HE CANNOT EXPERIENCE SOCIAL AFFECTIONS
6686-216563-0064 IS THE SHEPHERD SAID TO BE JUST TO HIS SHEEP AND HIS DOGS NO AND IF HE SAW FIT TO SHEAR AS MUCH WOOL FROM A LAMB SIX MONTHS OLD AS FROM A RAM OF TWO YEARS OR IF HE REQUIRED AS MUCH WORK FROM A YOUNG DOG AS FROM AN OLD ONE
6686-216563-0065 THEY WOULD SAY NOT THAT HE WAS UNJUST BUT THAT HE WAS FOOLISH BETWEEN MAN AND BEAST THERE IS NO SOCIETY THOUGH THERE MAY BE AFFECTION MAN LOVES THE ANIMALS AS THINGS AS SENTIENT THINGS IF YOU WILL BUT NOT AS PERSONS
6686-216563-0066 PHILOSOPHY AFTER HAVING ELIMINATED FROM THE IDEA OF GOD THE PASSIONS ASCRIBED TO HIM BY SUPERSTITION WILL THEN BE OBLIGED TO ELIMINATE ALSO THE VIRTUES WHICH OUR LIBERAL PIETY AWARDS TO HIM
6686-216563-0067 MATRIMONIAL LEGISLATION LIKE CIVIL LEGISLATION IS A MATTER FOR THE FUTURE TO SETTLE IF GOD SHOULD COME DOWN TO EARTH AND DWELL AMONG US WE COULD NOT LOVE HIM UNLESS HE BECAME LIKE US NOR GIVE HIM ANY THING UNLESS HE PRODUCED SOMETHING
6686-216563-0068 NOR LISTEN TO HIM UNLESS HE PROVED US MISTAKEN NOR WORSHIP HIM UNLESS HE MANIFESTED HIS POWER ALL THE LAWS OF OUR NATURE AFFECTIONAL ECONOMICAL AND INTELLECTUAL WOULD PREVENT US FROM TREATING HIM AS WE TREAT OUR FELLOW MEN
6686-216563-0069 HE WOULD HAVE TO BECOME A MAN NOW IF KINGS ARE IMAGES OF GOD AND EXECUTORS OF HIS WILL THEY CANNOT RECEIVE LOVE WEALTH OBEDIENCE AND GLORY FROM US UNLESS THEY CONSENT TO LABOR AND ASSOCIATE WITH US PRODUCE AS MUCH AS THEY CONSUME
6686-216563-0070 REASON WITH THEIR SUBJECTS AND DO WONDERFUL THINGS STILL MORE IF AS SOME PRETEND KINGS ARE PUBLIC FUNCTIONARIES THE LOVE WHICH IS DUE THEM IS MEASURED BY THEIR PERSONAL AMIABILITY OUR OBLIGATION TO OBEY THEM BY THE WISDOM OF THEIR COMMANDS
6686-216563-0071 AND THEIR CIVIL LIST BY THE TOTAL SOCIAL PRODUCTION DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF CITIZENS THUS JURISPRUDENCE POLITICAL ECONOMY AND PSYCHOLOGY AGREE IN ADMITTING THE LAW OF EQUALITY RIGHT AND DUTY
6686-216563-0072 AND THE COURSE OF EVENTS REVEALS IT TO US SOCIETY ADVANCES FROM EQUATION TO EQUATION TO THE EYES OF THE ECONOMIST THE REVOLUTIONS OF EMPIRES SEEM NOW LIKE THE REDUCTION OF ALGEBRAICAL QUANTITIES WHICH ARE INTER DEDUCIBLE
6686-216563-0073 NOW LIKE THE DISCOVERY OF UNKNOWN QUANTITIES INDUCED BY THE INEVITABLE INFLUENCE OF TIME FIGURES ARE THE PROVIDENCE OF HISTORY UNDOUBTEDLY THERE ARE OTHER ELEMENTS IN HUMAN PROGRESS BUT IN THE MULTITUDE OF HIDDEN CAUSES WHICH AGITATE NATIONS
6686-216563-0074 THERE IS NONE MORE POWERFUL OR CONSTANT NONE LESS OBSCURE THAN THE PERIODICAL EXPLOSIONS OF THE PROLETARIAT AGAINST PROPERTY PROPERTY ACTING BY EXCLUSION AND ENCROACHMENT WHILE POPULATION WAS INCREASING
6686-216563-0075 HAS BEEN THE LIFE PRINCIPLE AND DEFINITIVE CAUSE OF ALL REVOLUTIONS RELIGIOUS WARS AND WARS OF CONQUEST WHEN THEY HAVE STOPPED SHORT OF THE EXTERMINATION OF RACES HAVE BEEN ONLY ACCIDENTAL DISTURBANCES SOON REPAIRED BY THE MATHEMATICAL PROGRESSION OF THE LIFE OF NATIONS
6686-216563-0076 THE DOWNFALL AND DEATH OF SOCIETIES ARE DUE TO THE POWER OF ACCUMULATION POSSESSED BY PROPERTY IN THE MIDDLE AGES TAKE FLORENCE A REPUBLIC OF MERCHANTS AND BROKERS ALWAYS RENT BY ITS WELL KNOWN FACTIONS
6686-216563-0077 WHO WERE AFTER ALL ONLY THE PEOPLE AND THE PROPRIETORS FIGHTING AGAINST EACH OTHER FLORENCE RULED BY BANKERS AND BORNE DOWN AT LAST BY THE WEIGHT OF HER DEBTS
6686-216563-0078 PREYED UPON FROM ITS BIRTH BY USURY FLOURISHING NEVERTHELESS AS LONG AS THE KNOWN WORLD FURNISHED ITS TERRIBLE PROLETAIRES WITH LABOR STAINED WITH BLOOD BY CIVIL WAR AT EVERY INTERVAL OF REST
6686-216563-0079 AND DYING OF EXHAUSTION WHEN THE PEOPLE LOST TOGETHER WITH THEIR FORMER ENERGY THEIR LAST SPARK OF MORAL SENSE CARTHAGE A COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL CITY CONTINUALLY DIVIDED BY INTERNAL COMPETITION TYRE SIDON JERUSALEM
6686-216563-0080 NINEVEH BABYLON RUINED IN TURN BY COMMERCIAL RIVALRY AND AS WE NOW EXPRESS IT BY PANICS IN THE MARKET DO NOT THESE FAMOUS EXAMPLES SHOW CLEARLY ENOUGH THE FATE WHICH AWAITS MODERN NATIONS UNLESS THE PEOPLE
6686-216563-0081 UNLESS FRANCE WITH A SUDDEN BURST OF HER POWERFUL VOICE PROCLAIMS IN THUNDER TONES THE ABOLITION OF THE REGIME OF PROPERTY HERE MY TASK SHOULD END I HAVE PROVED THE RIGHT OF THE POOR I HAVE SHOWN THE USURPATION OF THE RICH
6686-216563-0082 I DEMAND JUSTICE IT IS NOT MY BUSINESS TO EXECUTE THE SENTENCE IF IT SHOULD BE ARGUED IN ORDER TO PROLONG FOR A FEW YEARS AN ILLEGITIMATE PRIVILEGE THAT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO DEMONSTRATE EQUALITY THAT IT IS NECESSARY ALSO TO ORGANIZE IT
6686-216563-0083 AND ABOVE ALL TO ESTABLISH IT PEACEFULLY I MIGHT REPLY THE WELFARE OF THE OPPRESSED IS OF MORE IMPORTANCE THAN OFFICIAL COMPOSURE EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS IS A NATURAL LAW UPON WHICH PUBLIC ECONOMY AND JURISPRUDENCE ARE BASED THE RIGHT TO LABOR
6686-216563-0084 AND THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH CANNOT GIVE WAY TO THE ANXIETIES OF POWER IT IS NOT FOR THE PROLETAIRE TO RECONCILE THE CONTRADICTIONS OF THE CODES STILL LESS TO SUFFER FOR THE ERRORS OF THE GOVERNMENT ON THE CONTRARY
6686-216563-0085 IT IS THE DUTY OF THE CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE POWER TO RECONSTRUCT ITSELF ON THE BASIS OF POLITICAL EQUALITY AN EVIL WHEN KNOWN SHOULD BE CONDEMNED AND DESTROYED THE LEGISLATOR CANNOT PLEAD IGNORANCE AS AN EXCUSE FOR UPHOLDING A GLARING INIQUITY
6686-216563-0086 RESTITUTION SHOULD NOT BE DELAYED JUSTICE JUSTICE RECOGNITION OF RIGHT REINSTATEMENT OF THE PROLETAIRE WHEN THESE RESULTS ARE ACCOMPLISHED THEN JUDGES AND CONSULS
6686-216563-0087 YOU MAY ATTEND TO YOUR POLICE AND PROVIDE A GOVERNMENT FOR THE REPUBLIC FOR THE REST I DO NOT THINK THAT A SINGLE ONE OF MY READERS ACCUSES ME OF KNOWING HOW TO DESTROY BUT OF NOT KNOWING HOW TO CONSTRUCT IN DEMONSTRATING THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY
6686-216563-0088 I HAVE LAID THE FOUNDATION OF THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE I HAVE DONE MORE I HAVE GIVEN AN EXAMPLE OF THE TRUE METHOD OF SOLVING POLITICAL AND LEGISLATIVE PROBLEMS OF THE SCIENCE ITSELF I CONFESS THAT I KNOW NOTHING MORE THAN ITS PRINCIPLE
6686-216563-0089 AND I KNOW OF NO ONE AT PRESENT WHO CAN BOAST OF HAVING PENETRATED DEEPER MANY PEOPLE CRY COME TO ME AND I WILL TEACH YOU THE TRUTH THESE PEOPLE MISTAKE FOR THE TRUTH THEIR CHERISHED OPINION AND ARDENT CONVICTION WHICH IS USUALLY ANY THING BUT THE TRUTH
6686-216563-0090 THE SCIENCE OF SOCIETY LIKE ALL HUMAN SCIENCES WILL BE FOR EVER INCOMPLETE THE DEPTH AND VARIETY OF THE QUESTIONS WHICH IT EMBRACES ARE INFINITE WE HARDLY KNOW THE A B C OF THIS SCIENCE
6686-216563-0091 A CERTAIN PHILOLOGICAL SOCIETY DECIDED LINGUISTIC QUESTIONS BY A PLURALITY OF VOTES OUR PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES
6686-216563-0092 WOULD BE EVEN MORE RIDICULOUS THE TASK OF THE TRUE PUBLICIST IN THE AGE IN WHICH WE LIVE IS TO CLOSE THE MOUTHS OF QUACKS AND CHARLATANS AND TO TEACH THE PUBLIC TO DEMAND DEMONSTRATIONS INSTEAD OF BEING CONTENTED WITH SYMBOLS AND PROGRAMMES
6686-216563-0093 BEFORE TALKING OF THE SCIENCE ITSELF IT IS NECESSARY TO ASCERTAIN ITS OBJECT AND DISCOVER ITS METHOD AND PRINCIPLE THE GROUND MUST BE CLEARED OF THE PREJUDICES WHICH ENCUMBER IT SUCH IS THE MISSION OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
6686-216563-0094 FOR MY PART I HAVE SWORN FIDELITY TO MY WORK OF DEMOLITION AND I WILL NOT CEASE TO PURSUE THE TRUTH THROUGH THE RUINS AND RUBBISH I HATE TO SEE A THING HALF DONE AND IT WILL BE BELIEVED WITHOUT ANY ASSURANCE OF MINE THAT HAVING DARED TO RAISE MY HAND AGAINST THE HOLY ARK
6686-216563-0095 I SHALL NOT REST CONTENTED WITH THE REMOVAL OF THE COVER THE MYSTERIES OF THE SANCTUARY OF INIQUITY MUST BE UNVEILED THE TABLES OF THE OLD ALLIANCE BROKEN AND ALL THE OBJECTS OF THE ANCIENT FAITH THROWN IN A HEAP TO THE SWINE
6686-216563-0096 A RESUME OF POLITICAL SCIENCE THE MONUMENT OF TWENTY LEGISLATURES A CODE HAS BEEN WRITTEN THE PRIDE OF A CONQUEROR AND THE SUMMARY OF ANCIENT WISDOM WELL OF THIS CHARTER AND THIS CODE NOT ONE ARTICLE SHALL BE LEFT STANDING UPON ANOTHER
6686-216563-0097 THE TIME HAS COME FOR THE WISE TO CHOOSE THEIR COURSE AND PREPARE FOR RECONSTRUCTION BUT SINCE A DESTROYED ERROR NECESSARILY IMPLIES A COUNTER TRUTH I WILL NOT FINISH THIS TREATISE WITHOUT SOLVING THE FIRST PROBLEM OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
6686-216563-0098 THAT WHICH RECEIVES THE ATTENTION OF ALL MINDS
