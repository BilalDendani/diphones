4289-21393-0000 KATE TURNED AND PLACING THE BABY ON THE FRONT SEAT SHE KNELT AND PUT HER ARMS AROUND THE LITTLE THING BUT HER LIPS ONLY REPEATED THE WORDS PRAISE THE LORD FOR THIS PRECIOUS BABY HER HEART WAS FILLED WITH HIGH RESOLVE SHE WOULD REAR THE BABY WITH SUCH CARE
4289-21393-0001 SHE WOULD BE MORE CAREFUL WITH ADAM SHE WOULD MAKE HEROIC EFFORT TO HELP HIM TO CLEAN UNASHAMED MANHOOD SHE WOULD BE A BETTER SISTER TO ALL HER FAMILY SHE WOULD BE FRIENDLIER AND HAVE MORE PATIENCE WITH THE NEIGHBOURS
4289-21393-0002 SHE WOULD JOIN IN WHATEVER EFFORT THE CHURCH WAS MAKING TO HOLD AND INCREASE ITS MEMBERSHIP AMONG THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO RAISE FUNDS TO KEEP UP THE ORGANIZATION ALL THE TIME HER MIND WAS BUSY THINKING OUT THESE FINE RESOLVES

4289-21393-0014 IT NEVER OCCURRED TO KATE THAT SHE HAD DONE AN UNPRECEDENTED THING SHE HAD DONE AS HER HEART DICTATED SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT SHE PUT THE MINISTER INTO A MOST UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION WHEN HE FOLLOWED HER REQUEST TO BAPTIZE HER AND THE CHILD
4289-21393-0015 SHE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF PROBATIONS AND EXAMINATIONS AND CATECHISMS SHE HAD READ THE BIBLE AS WAS THE CUSTOM EVERY MORNING BEFORE HER SCHOOL IN THAT BOOK WHEN A MAN WANTED TO FOLLOW JESUS HE FOLLOWED
4289-21393-0016 JESUS ACCEPTED HIM AND THAT WAS ALL THERE WAS TO IT WITH KATE THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK NANCY ELLEN CAME FLYING UP THE WALK ON WINGED FEET HERSELF SHE CARRIED PHOTOGRAPHS OF SEVERAL SMALL CHILDREN

4289-21393-0038 WHILE TWO MEN AND A WOMAN WERE CARRYING A LIMP FORM ACROSS THE MEADOW TOWARD THE HOUSE AS THEIR CAR STOPPED KATE KISSED THE BABY MECHANICALLY HANDED HER TO ADAM AND RAN INTO THE HOUSE WHERE SHE DRAGGED A COUCH TO THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRST ROOM SHE ENTERED
4289-21393-0039 FOUND A PILLOW AND BROUGHT A BUCKET OF WATER AND A TOWEL FROM THE KITCHEN THEY CARRIED NANCY ELLEN IN AND LAID HER DOWN KATE BEGAN UNFASTENING CLOTHING AND TRYING TO GET THE BROKEN BODY IN SHAPE FOR THE DOCTOR TO WORK UPON
4289-21393-0040 BUT SHE SPREAD THE TOWEL OVER WHAT HAD BEEN A FACE OF UNUSUAL BEAUTY ROBERT CAME IN A FEW MINUTES THEN ALL OF THEM WORKED UNDER HIS DIRECTIONS UNTIL HE SUDDENLY SANK TO THE FLOOR BURYING HIS FACE IN NANCY ELLEN'S BREAST THEN THEY KNEW

4289-21393-0043 SO THAT WAS A COMFORT TO KATE WHO TOOK TIME TO PITY HIM EVEN IN HER BLACKEST HOUR SHE HAD SOME VERY BLACK ONES SHE COULD HAVE WAILED AND LAMENTED AND RELINQUISHED ALL SHE HAD GAINED BUT SHE DID NOT
4289-21393-0044 SHE MERELY WENT ON WITH LIFE AS SHE ALWAYS HAD LIVED IT TO THE BEST OF HER ABILITY WHEN SHE WAS SO NUMBED WITH GRIEF SHE SCARCELY KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING SHE KEPT HERSELF DRIVEN ABOUT THE HOUSE
4289-21393-0045 AND WHEN SHE COULD FIND NO MORE TO DO TOOK LITTLE POLL IN HER ARMS AND WENT OUT IN THE FIELDS TO ADAM WHERE SHE FOUND THE BABY A SAFE PLACE AND THEN CUT AND HUSKED CORN AS USUAL EVERY SABBATH AND OFTEN DURING THE WEEK HER FEET CARRIED HER TO THE CEMETERY
4289-21393-0046 WHERE SHE SAT IN THE DEEP GRASS AND LOOKED AT THOSE THREE LONG MOUNDS AND TRIED TO UNDERSTAND LIFE DEEPER STILL TO FATHOM DEATH SHE AND HER MOTHER HAD AGREED THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NOW KATE TRIED AS NEVER BEFORE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT AND WHERE
4289-21393-0047 AND WHY THAT SOMETHING WAS MANY DAYS SHE WOULD SIT FOR AN HOUR AT A TIME THINKING AND AT LAST SHE ARRIVED AT FIXED CONVICTIONS THAT SETTLED MATTERS FOREVER WITH HER ONE DAY AFTER SHE HAD ARRANGED THE FALL ROSES SHE HAD GROWN
4289-21393-0048 AND SOME ROADSIDE ASTERS SHE HAD GATHERED IN PASSING SHE SAT IN DEEP THOUGHT WHEN A CAR STOPPED ON THE ROAD KATE LOOKED UP TO SEE ROBERT COMING ACROSS THE CHURCHYARD WITH HIS ARMS FULL OF GREENHOUSE ROSES
4289-21393-0049 HE CARRIED A BIG BUNCH OF DEEP RED FOR HER MOTHER WHITE FOR POLLY AND A LARGE SHEAF OF WARM PINK FOR NANCY ELLEN KATE KNELT UP AND TAKING HER FLOWERS SHE MOVED THEM LOWER AND SILENTLY HELPED ROBERT PLACE THOSE HE HAD BROUGHT
4289-21393-0050 THEN SHE SAT WHERE SHE HAD BEEN AND LOOKED AT HIM FINALLY HE ASKED STILL HUNTING THE WHY KATE WHY DOESN'T SO MUCH MATTER SAID KATE AS WHERE I'M ENOUGH OF A FATALIST TO BELIEVE THAT MOTHER IS HERE BECAUSE SHE WAS OLD AND WORN OUT
4289-21393-0051 POLLY HAD A CLEAR CASE OF URIC POISON WHILE I'D STAKE MY LIFE NANCY ELLEN WAS GLOATING OVER THE PICTURE SHE CARRIED WHEN SHE RAN INTO THAT LOOSE SAND IN EACH OF THEIR CASES I AM SATISFIED AS TO WHY AS WELL AS ABOUT FATHER
4289-21393-0052 THE THING THAT HOLDS ME AND FASCINATES ME AND THAT I HAVE SUCH A TIME BEING SURE OF IS WHERE ROBERT GLANCED UPWARD AND ASKED ISN'T THERE ROOM ENOUGH UP THERE KATE TOO MUCH SAID KATE
4289-21393-0053 AND WHAT IS THE SOUL AND HOW CAN IT BRIDGE THE VORTEX LYING BETWEEN US AND OTHER WORLDS THAT MAN NEVER CAN BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF AIR TO BREATHE AND SUPPORT HIM I DON'T KNOW SAID ROBERT AND IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT I DO KNOW
4289-21393-0054 WHAT A MAN CANNOT DO I STILL BELIEVE IN THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL OH YES SAID KATE IF THERE IS ANY SUCH THING IN SCIENCE AS A SELF EVIDENT FACT THAT IS ONE THAT IS PROVABLE ROBERT LOOKED AT HER EAGER FACE
4289-21393-0055 HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT PROVING IT KATE HE ASKED WHY THIS WAY SAID KATE LEANING TO STRAIGHTEN AND ARRANGE THE DELICATE VELVET PETALLED ROSES WITH HER SURE WORK ABUSED FINGERS TAKE THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD
4289-21393-0056 AND DOWN TO THE ICE OF THE SOUTHERN POLE AGAIN AND IN BLACKEST AFRICA FARTHEST WILDEST BORNEO YOU WILL NEVER DISCOVER ONE SINGLE TRIBE OF CREATURES UPRIGHT AND BELONGING TO THE RACE OF MAN
4289-21393-0057 WHO DID NOT COME INTO THE WORLD WITH FOUR PRIMAL INSTINCTS THEY ALL REPRODUCE THEMSELVES THEY ALL MAKE SOMETHING INTENDED FOR MUSIC THEY ALL EXPRESS A FEELING IN THEIR HEARTS BY THE EXERCISE WE CALL DANCE THEY ALL BELIEVE IN THE AFTER LIFE OF THE SOUL
4289-21393-0058 THIS BELIEF IS AS MUCH A PART OF ANY MAN EVER BORN IN ANY LOCATION AS HIS HANDS AND HIS FEET WHETHER HE BELIEVES HIS SOUL ENTERS A CAT AND WORKS BACK TO MAN AGAIN AFTER LONG TRANSMIGRATION OR GOES TO A HAPPY HUNTING GROUND AS OUR INDIANS
4289-21393-0059 MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WITH THE FACT THAT HE ENTERS THIS WORLD WITH BELIEF IN AFTER LIFE OF SOME KIND WE SEE MATERIAL EVIDENCE IN INCREASE THAT MAN IS NOT DEFEATED IN HIS DESIRE TO REPRODUCE HIMSELF
4289-21393-0060 WE HAVE ADVANCED TO SOMETHING BETTER THAN TOM TOMS AND POW WOWS FOR MUSIC AND DANCE THESE DESIRES ARE FULFILLED BEFORE US NOW TELL ME WHY THE VERY STRONGEST OF ALL THE MOST DEEPLY ROOTED THE BELIEF IN AFTER LIFE SHOULD COME TO NOTHING
4289-21393-0061 WHY SHOULD THE OTHERS BE REAL AND THAT A DREAM I DON'T THINK IT IS SAID ROBERT IT'S MY BIGGEST SELF EVIDENT FACT SAID KATE CONCLUSIVELY I NEVER HEARD ANY ONE ELSE SAY THESE THINGS BUT I THINK THEM AND THEY ARE PROVABLE
4289-21393-0062 I ALWAYS BELIEVED THERE WAS SOMETHING BUT SINCE I SAW MOTHER GO I KNOW THERE IS SHE STOOD IN FULL EVENING LIGHT I LOOKED STRAIGHT IN HER FACE AND ROBERT YOU KNOW I'M NO CREATURE OF FANCIES AND DELUSIONS I TELL YOU I SAW HER SOUL PASS
4289-21393-0063 I SAW THE LIFE GO FROM HER AND GO ON AND ON I SAW HER BODY STAND ERECT LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO REACH HER AND PICK HER UP AFTER ITS PASSING THAT I KNOW I SHOULDN'T THINK OF QUESTIONING IT KATE SAID ROBERT
4289-21393-0064 BUT DON'T YOU THINK YOU ARE RATHER LIMITING MAN WHEN YOU NARROW HIM TO FOUR PRIMAL INSTINCTS OH I DON'T KNOW SAID KATE AIR TO BREATHE AND FOOD TO SUSTAIN ARE PRESUPPOSED MAN LEARNS TO FIGHT IN SELF DEFENSE AND TO ACQUIRE WHAT HE COVETS
4289-21393-0065 HE LEARNS TO COVET BY SEEING STRONGER MEN IN BETTER LOCATIONS SURPASS HIS ACHIEVEMENTS SO IF HE IS STRONG ENOUGH HE GOES AND ROBS THEM BY FORCE HE LEARNS THE DESIRE FOR THE CHASE IN FOOD HUNTING I THINK FOUR ARE PLENTY TO START WITH
4289-21393-0066 I MUST GO NOW SHALL I TAKE YOU HOME KATE GLANCED AT THE SUN AND SHOOK HER HEAD I CAN STAY HALF AN HOUR LONGER I DON'T MIND THE WALK I NEED EXERCISE TO KEEP ME IN CONDITION GOOD BYE AS HE STARTED HIS CAR HE GLANCED BACK
4289-21393-0067 SHE WAS LEANING OVER THE FLOWERS ABSORBED IN THEIR BEAUTY KATE SAT LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HER UNTIL TIME TO HELP WITH THE EVENING WORK AND PREPARE SUPPER THEN SHE AROSE SHE STOOD LOOKING DOWN A LONG TIME
4289-21393-0068 FINALLY SHE PICKED UP A FINE SPECIMEN OF EACH OF THE ROSES AND SLOWLY DROPPED THEM ON HER FATHER'S GRAVE THERE
