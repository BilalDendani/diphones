7732-107517-0000 I CONSENT TO THIS CONSTITUTION HE DECLARED BECAUSE I EXPECT NO BETTER AND BECAUSE I AM NOT SURE THAT IT IS NOT THE BEST WASHINGTON SOUGHT ALSO TO SECURE UNANIMITY AND HAMILTON DECLARED
7732-107517-0001 I AM ANXIOUS THAT EVERY MEMBER SHOULD SIGN A FEW BY REFUSING MAY DO INFINITE MISCHIEF NO MAN'S IDEAS ARE MORE REMOTE FROM THE PLAN THAN MY OWN ARE KNOWN TO BE
7732-107517-0002 BUT IS IT POSSIBLE TO DELIBERATE BETWEEN ANARCHY AND CONVULSION ON THE ONE SIDE AND THE CHANCE OF GOOD TO BE EXPECTED FROM THE PLAN ON THE OTHER SUCH WORDS HAD SOME WEIGHT BUT NOT ENOUGH TO SECURE UNANIMITY
7732-107517-0003 ALL THE STATES VOTED FOR THE CONSTITUTION BUT SEVERAL DELEGATES WENT ON RECORD AGAINST IT AND HAMILTON'S TWO ASSOCIATES FROM NEW YORK WERE ABSENT IT WAS THIS ALONE WHICH SAVED NEW YORK FROM BEING RECORDED AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION
7732-107517-0004 IT WAS HE WHO IN A BOLD PLAIN HAND INSCRIBED ON THE GREAT SHEET OF PARCHMENT THE NAME OF EACH STATE AS THE DELEGATIONS CAME FORWARD ONE AFTER ANOTHER IN GEOGRAPHICAL ORDER AND AFFIXED THEIR SIGNATURES TO THE PRECIOUS DOCUMENT
7732-107517-0005 WHICH WAS TO FOUND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAMILTON RETURNED TO NEW YORK DETERMINED TO USE HIS UTMOST POWERS TO SECURE THE RATIFICATION OF THE CONSTITUTION AS THE BEST ATTAINABLE MEANS OF AVERTING THE DANGERS OF DISUNION
7732-107517-0006 ALTHOUGH CORDIALLY SUPPORTED BY JOHN JAY AND EDWARD LIVINGSTON HAMILTON IN THE FIGHT FOR RATIFICATION IN NEW YORK WAS THE NATURAL LEADER HE FOUND ARRAYED AGAINST HIM THE WHOLE INFLUENCE OF GOVERNOR CLINTON
7732-107517-0007 AND THE DOMINANT PARTY IN NEW YORK POLITICS CLINTON WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY OPPOSED TO UNION BUT HE ATTACHED TO IT SO MANY RESERVATIONS THAT FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES HE WAS AN OPPONENT OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION
7732-107517-0008 THE BATTLE OVER RATIFICATION BEGAN ON THE QUESTION OF THE CHOICE OF DELEGATES TO THE STATE CONVENTION IT WAS IN THIS FIELD THAT HAMILTON FOUGHT THE GREAT FIGHT WITH HIS PEN WHICH HAS LEFT TO POSTERITY
7732-107517-0009 THE FINE EXPOSITION OF THE CONSTITUTION KNOWN AS THE FEDERALIST A SOCIETY WAS FORMED IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK TO RESIST THE ADOPTION OF THE CONSTITUTION AND ARTICLES SOON BEGAN TO APPEAR IN THE LOCAL PRESS CRITICISING AND OPPOSING IT
7732-107517-0010 PREPARING A VIGOROUS LETTER WHILE GLIDING DOWN THE HUDSON IN REPLY TO SOME OF THE FIRST POINTS OF THE OPPOSITION HAMILTON SOON EXTENDED THE PROJECT INTO A SERIES OF STRONG PAPERS WHICH APPEARED TWICE A WEEK FOR TWENTY WEEKS OVER THE SIGNATURE OF
7732-107517-0011 PUBLIUS HE SECURED THE AID OF MADISON AND JAY WHO WROTE SOME OF THE PAPERS BUT THE PROJECT WAS HAMILTON'S THE MAJORITY OF THE PAPERS WERE WRITTEN BY HIM AND TO HIM HAS BEEN JUSTLY GIVEN THE CREDIT OF THE WELL KNIT AND POWERFUL ARGUMENTS
7732-107517-0012 AFTERWARDS PRINTED UNDER THE TITLE OF THE FEDERALIST TAKING UP POINT BY POINT THE PROVISIONS OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION HAMILTON BY SKILLFUL ARGUMENT DRAWN FROM THE CLOSEST ABSTRACT REASONING
7732-107517-0013 THE RECENT EXPERIENCE OF THE STATES AND THE HISTORY OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES SOUGHT TO SHOW THAT THE NEW CONSTITUTION WAS BASED UPON SOUND PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT THAT IT WAS WELL CALCULATED TO CARRY OUT THESE PRINCIPLES AND
7732-107517-0014 THAT ITS ACCEPTANCE WAS PRACTICALLY THE ONLY COURSE OPEN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO INSURE FOR THEMSELVES THE BENEFITS OF LIBERTY PROSPERITY AND PEACE THE FEDERALIST ALTHOUGH A PURELY POLITICAL ARGUMENT HAS SURVIVED THE OCCASION WHICH CALLED IT FORTH
7732-107517-0015 AS ONE OF THE MASTER DOCUMENTS OF POLITICAL WRITING THAT IT HAS A DISTINCT PLACE IN LITERATURE IS ADMITTED BY SO SEVERE A CRITIC AS PROFESSOR BARRETT WENDELL IN HIS RECENT LITERARY HISTORY OF AMERICA IT IS WORTH WHILE QUOTING
7732-107517-0016 HIS ACUTE LITERARY JUDGMENT OF ITS MERITS AS A SERIES OF FORMAL ESSAYS THE FEDERALIST GROUPS ITSELF ROUGHLY WITH THE TATLER THE SPECTATOR AND THOSE NUMEROUS DESCENDANTS OF THEIRS WHICH FILL THE LITERARY RECORDS OF EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ENGLAND
7732-107517-0017 IT DIFFERS HOWEVER FROM ALL THESE IN BOTH SUBSTANCE AND PURPOSE THE TATLER THE SPECTATOR AND THEIR SUCCESSORS DEALT WITH SUPERFICIAL MATTERS IN A SPIRIT OF LITERARY AMENITY THE FEDERALIST
7732-107517-0018 DEALS IN AN ARGUMENTATIVE SPIRIT AS EARNEST AS THAT OF ANY PURITAN DIVINE WITH POLITICAL PRINCIPLES PARAMOUNT IN OUR HISTORY AND IT IS SO WISELY THOUGHTFUL THAT ONE MAY ALMOST DECLARE IT THE PERMANENT BASIS OF SOUND THINKING
7732-107517-0019 CONCERNING AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW LIKE ALL THE EDUCATED WRITING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY TOO IT IS PHRASED WITH A RHYTHMICAL BALANCE AND URBANE POLISH WHICH GIVE IT CLAIM TO LITERARY DISTINCTION
7732-107517-0020 WHILE THE WRITTEN ARGUMENTS OF HAMILTON IN THE FEDERALIST HAVE SURVIVED FOR A HUNDRED YEARS AND BEEN CONSULTED BY FOREIGN STUDENTS IN THE FORMATION OF NEW CONSTITUTIONS A MORE SEVERE TASK WAS IMPOSED UPON HIM
7732-107517-0021 AT THE MEETING OF THE STATE CONVENTION CALLED TO CONSIDER THE REPORT OF THE CONVENTION AT PHILADELPHIA IT WAS IN SOME RESPECTS THE HARDEST TASK EVER SET WITH ANY HOPE OF SUCCESS BEFORE A PARLIAMENTARY LEADER INDEED TO THE SUPERFICIAL OBSERVER
7732-107517-0022 THERE WOULD HAVE SEEMED TO BE NO HOPE OF SUCCESS WHEN IN THE ELECTIONS TO THE STATE CONVENTION THE SUPPORTERS OF GOVERNOR CLINTON CHOSE FORTY SIX DELEGATES AND LEFT ON THE SIDE OF HAMILTON ONLY NINETEEN OF THE SIXTY FIVE MEMBERS
7732-107517-0023 BUT THIS STATEMENT OF THE CASE GIVES A SOMEWHAT DARKER COLOR TO THE SITUATION THAN THE REAL FACTS THERE WAS A STRONG AND GROWING BODY OF PUBLIC SENTIMENT FOR THE CONSTITUTION IN NEW YORK CITY AND THE COUNTIES ALONG THE HUDSON WHICH EVEN LED TO THE SUGGESTION
7732-107517-0024 THAT THEY SHOULD JOIN THE UNION IN ANY EVENT AND LEAVE THE NORTHERN COUNTIES TO SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES IT WAS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED MOREOVER THAT HOWEVER STRONG THE OBJECTIONS WERE TO THE CONSTITUTION THE CHOICE LAY PRACTICALLY
7732-107517-0025 BETWEEN THIS CONSTITUTION AND NONE BETWEEN THE PROPOSED GOVERNMENT AND ANARCHY SO STRONG WAS THE SENTIMENT THAT THE CONSTITUTION MUST BE ACCEPTED IN SOME FORM THAT ITS OPPONENTS IN THE STATE CONVENTION DID NOT VENTURE UPON IMMEDIATE REJECTION
7732-107517-0026 FORTUNATELY THEIR COURSE IN FIGHTING FOR DELAY ONLY TENDED TO MAKE IT CLEARER THAT NEW YORK WOULD STAND ALONE IF SHE FAILED TO RATIFY WHILE THE DREAM OF INDEPENDENT SOVEREIGNTY OR THE LEADERSHIP IN A FEDERATION WHICH SHOULD DICTATE TERMS TO THE SURROUNDING STATES
7732-107517-0027 WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS ATTRACTIONS TO THE MORE AMBITIOUS OF THE OPPOSITION LEADERS THERE WAS A DARKER SIDE TO THE PROPOSITION WHICH WAS MUCH LESS ATTRACTIVE INDEPENDENCE FOR NEW YORK MEANT A HEAVY BURDEN OF TAXATION FOR A SEPARATE ARMY AND NAVY
7732-107517-0028 FOR GUARDING LONG FRONTIERS ON THE EAST NORTH AND SOUTH FOR SUPPORTING AN EXTENSIVE CUSTOMS SERVICE ALONG THE SAME FRONTIERS FOR MAINTAINING MINISTERS AT FOREIGN COURTS AND CONSULS IN THE LEADING CITIES OF THE WORLD AND
7732-107517-0029 FOR MEETING ALL THE OTHER EXPENSES OF A SOVEREIGN NATION IT WAS FORTUNATE FOR THE STATE AND THE COUNTRY THAT THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION TO THE CONSTITUTION IN THE NEW YORK CONVENTION WAS A MAN OF A HIGH ORDER OF ABILITY
7732-107517-0030 WHOSE MIND WAS OPEN IN AN UNUSUAL DEGREE TO THE INFLUENCE OF LOGICAL REASONING THIS MAN WAS MELANCTHON SMITH WHO IS ACCORDED BY CHANCELLOR KENT THE GREAT AUTHORITY ON AMERICAN LAW THE CREDIT OF BEING NOTED
7732-107517-0031 FOR HIS LOVE OF READING TENACIOUS MEMORY POWERFUL INTELLECT AND FOR THE METAPHYSICAL AND LOGICAL DISCUSSIONS OF WHICH HE WAS A MASTER IT IS AS MUCH TO HIS CREDIT AS THAT OF HAMILTON THAT HE FINALLY ADMITTED THAT HE HAD BEEN CONVINCED BY HAMILTON
7732-107517-0032 AND THAT HE SHOULD VOTE FOR THE CONSTITUTION THIS RESULT WAS ONLY REACHED HOWEVER AFTER A LONG AND SOMETIMES ACRIMONIOUS STRUGGLE IN WHICH HAMILTON WAS ON HIS FEET DAY AFTER DAY EXPLAINING AND DEFENDING EACH SEPARATE CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION
7732-107517-0033 NOT ONLY IN ITS REAL MEANING BUT AGAINST ALL THE DISTORTED CONSTRUCTIONS PUT UPON IT BY THE MOST ACUTE AND JEALOUS OF CRITICS BUT EVENTS HAD BEEN FIGHTING WITH HAMILTON STATE AFTER STATE HAD RATIFIED THE NEW DOCUMENT
7732-107517-0034 AND NEWS OF THEIR ACTION HAD REACHED NEW YORK NINE STATES THE NUMBER NECESSARY TO PUT THE CONSTITUTION IN FORCE WERE MADE UP BY THE RATIFICATION OF NEW HAMPSHIRE JUNE TWENTY FIRST SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT STILL NEW YORK HESITATED
7732-107517-0035 AND HAMILTON WROTE TO MADISON OUR CHANCE OF SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON YOU SYMPTOMS OF RELAXATION IN SOME OF THE LEADERS AUTHORIZE A GLEAM OF HOPE IF YOU DO WELL BUT CERTAINLY I THINK NOT OTHERWISE VIRGINIA JUSTIFIED HIS HOPES
7732-107517-0036 BY A MAJORITY OF EIGHTY NINE AGAINST SEVENTY NINE FOR RATIFICATION JUNE TWENTY FIFTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE NEWS REACHED NEW YORK ON JULY THIRD THE OPPOSITION THERE THOUGH SHOWING SIGNS OF RELENTING WAS STILL STUBBORN
7732-107517-0037 CONDITIONAL RATIFICATION WITH A LONG STRING OF AMENDMENTS WAS FIRST PROPOSED JAY FIRMLY INSISTED THAT THE WORD CONDITIONAL MUST BE ERASED FINALLY ON JULY ELEVENTH HE PROPOSED UNCONDITIONAL RATIFICATION
7732-107517-0038 MELANCTHON SMITH THEN PROPOSED RATIFICATION WITH THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW IF THE AMENDMENTS SHOULD NOT BE ACCEPTED HAMILTON EXPOSED THE FOLLY OF SUCH A PROJECT IN A BRILLIANT SPEECH WHICH LED SMITH TO ADMIT THAT CONDITIONAL RATIFICATION WAS AN ABSURDITY
7732-107517-0039 OTHER SIMILAR PROPOSALS WERE BROUGHT FORWARD BUT THEY WERE EVIDENTLY EQUIVALENT TO REJECTION BY INDIRECTION WHICH WOULD HAVE LEFT NEW YORK OUT OF THE NEW UNION FINALLY SAMUEL JONES ANOTHER BROAD MINDED MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITION
7732-107517-0040 PROPOSED RATIFICATION WITHOUT CONDITIONS BUT IN FULL CONFIDENCE THAT CONGRESS WOULD ADOPT ALL NEEDED AMENDMENTS WITH THE SUPPORT OF SMITH THIS FORM OF RATIFICATION WAS CARRIED
7732-107517-0041 BY THE SLENDER MAJORITY OF THREE VOTES JULY TWENTY SIXTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT BY THIS NARROW MARGIN IT WAS DECIDED THAT NEW YORK SHOULD FORM A PART OF THE UNION AND THAT THE GREAT EXPERIMENT IN REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT
7732-107517-0042 SHOULD NOT BEGIN WITH THE TWO HALVES OF THE COUNTRY SEPARATED BY A HOSTILE POWER COMMANDING THE GREATEST SEAPORT OF THE COLONIES HAMILTON THUS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT PART IN WINNING THE FIRST GREAT BATTLE FOR THE CONSTITUTION
7732-107517-0043 RATIFICATION WAS ONLY ONE OF MANY STEPS WHICH REMAINED TO BE TAKEN BEFORE THE NEW GOVERNMENT WAS IN WORKING ORDER HAMILTON HURRIED BACK TO THE FEDERAL CONGRESS AND CARRIED AN ORDINANCE FIXING THE DATES AND THE PLACE FOR PUTTING THE NEW GOVERNMENT IN OPERATION
7732-107517-0044 WHEN HE RETURNED TO NEW YORK HE WAS BEATEN FOR REELECTION TO CONGRESS AND GOVERNOR CLINTON AND HIS PARTY RETAINED SUCH A FIRM GRIP UPON THE LEGISLATURE THAT A DEADLOCK OCCURRED BETWEEN THE FEDERALIST HOUSE AND THE OPPOSITION SENATE
7732-107517-0045 NEW YORK WAS UNREPRESENTED IN THE FIRST ELECTORAL COLLEGE AND HAD NO SENATORS AT THE MEETING OF THE FIRST CONGRESS THE STATE ELECTIONS WHICH FOLLOWED RESULTED IN DEFEAT FOR THE FEDERALISTS IN THE ELECTION OF THE GOVERNOR
7732-107517-0046 BUT THEY CARRIED THE LEGISLATURE AND ELECTED TWO SENATORS GENERAL SCHUYLER AND RUFUS KING KING HAD RECENTLY COME FROM MASSACHUSETTS AND HAMILTON'S INSISTENCE THAT HE SHOULD BE CHOSEN CAUSED A BREACH WITH THE LIVINGSTONS
7732-107517-0047 WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEFEAT OF SCHUYLER TWO YEARS LATER AND THE ELECTION OF AARON BURR HAMILTON'S COURSE IN THIS MATTER WAS ONE OF MANY CASES IN WHICH HE SHOWED THAT HE WAS NOT AN ASTUTE POLITICIAN NOR AN ADEPT AT DEALING WITH MEN
