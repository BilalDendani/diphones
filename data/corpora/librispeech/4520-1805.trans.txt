4520-1805-0000 TRADITION SAITH SIR NORMAN KINGSLEY'S STATE OF MIND WAS DECIDEDLY DEPRESSED AS THE DOOR SHUT VIOLENTLY HE LEANED AGAINST IT AND LISTENED TO HIS JAILERS PLACE THE GREAT BARS INTO THEIR SOCKETS AND FELT HE WAS SHUT IN
4520-1805-0001 IN THE DREARIEST DARKEST DISMALEST DISAGREEABLEST PLACE THAT IT HAD EVER BEEN HIS MISFORTUNE TO ENTER
4520-1805-0002 SHE WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST PERHAPS DREAMING OF HIM AND LITTLE KNOWING THAT HIS HEAD WAS TO BE CUT OFF IN HALF AN HOUR IN COURSE OF TIME MORNING WOULD COME IT WAS NOT LIKELY THE ORDINARY COURSE OF NATURE WOULD BE CUT OFF BECAUSE HE WAS
4520-1805-0003 AND LOOKING A THOUSAND TIMES PRETTIER THAN EVER STAND AT THE WINDOW AND WAIT FOR HIM AH SHE MIGHT WAIT MUCH GOOD WOULD IT DO HER ABOUT THAT TIME HE WOULD PROBABLY BE WHERE IT WAS A RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTION BUT EASILY ANSWERED
4520-1805-0004 AND DEPRESSED HIM TO A VERY DESPONDING DEGREE INDEED HE THOUGHT OF ORMISTON AND LA MASQUE NO DOUBT THEY WERE BILLING AND COOING IN MOST APPROVED FASHION JUST THEN AND NEVER THINKING OF HIM THOUGH BUT FOR LA MASQUE AND HIS OWN FOLLY
4520-1805-0005 HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HALF MARRIED BY THIS TIME HE THOUGHT OF COUNT L'ESTRANGE AND MASTER HUBERT
4520-1805-0006 THE OTHER WOULD AND EACH BEING EQUALLY BAD IT WAS ABOUT A TOSS UP IN AGONY WHICH GOT HER HE THOUGHT OF QUEEN MIRANDA AND OF THE ADAGE PUT NO TRUST IN PRINCES
4520-1805-0007 MORE PARTICULARLY SUCH HANDSOME HUMAN NATURE THAT SHE COULD FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING PAT HIM ON THE BACK ONE MOMENT AND KICK HIM TO THE SCAFFOLD THE NEXT HE THOUGHT DEJECTEDLY WHAT A FOOL HE WAS EVER TO HAVE COME BACK
4520-1805-0008 OR EVEN HAVING COME BACK NOT TO HAVE TAKEN GREATER PAINS TO STAY UP ALOFT INSTEAD OF PITCHING ABRUPTLY HEAD FOREMOST INTO SUCH A SELECT COMPANY WITHOUT AN INVITATION HE THOUGHT TOO WHAT A COLD DAMP UNWHOLESOME CHAMBER THEY HAD LODGED HIM IN
4520-1805-0009 AND MIASMATIC FEVER IF THEY WOULD ONLY LET HIM LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO ENJOY THOSE BLESSINGS AND THIS HAVING BROUGHT HIM TO THE END OF HIS MELANCHOLY MEDITATION HE BEGAN TO REFLECT HOW HE COULD BEST AMUSE HIMSELF IN THE INTERIM
4520-1805-0010 BEFORE QUITTING THIS VALE OF TEARS THE CANDLE WAS STILL BLINKING FEEBLY ON THE FLOOR SHEDDING TEARS OF WAX IN ITS FEEBLE PROSTRATION AND IT SUDDENLY REMINDED HIM OF THE DWARF'S ADVICE TO EXAMINE HIS DARK BOWER OF REPOSE
4520-1805-0011 SO HE PICKED IT UP AND SNUFFED IT WITH HIS FINGERS AND HELD IT ALOOF MUCH AS ROBINSON CRUSOE HELD THE BRAND IN THE DARK CAVERN WITH THE DEAD GOAT IN THE VELVET PALL OF BLACKNESS BEFORE ALLUDED TO ITS SMALL WAN RAY PIERCED BUT A FEW INCHES
4520-1805-0012 AND ONLY MADE THE DARKNESS VISIBLE BUT SIR NORMAN GROPED HIS WAY TO THE WALL WHICH HE FOUND TO BE ALL OVER GREEN AND NOISOME SLIME AND BROKEN OUT INTO A COLD CLAMMY PERSPIRATION AS THOUGH IT WERE AT ITS LAST GASP
4520-1805-0013 A FACT WHICH HAD HIS LITTLE FRIEND KNOWN HE WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT IT HE MANAGED TO MAKE THE CIRCUIT OF HIS PRISON WHICH HE FOUND RATHER SPACIOUS AND BY NO MEANS UNINHABITED FOR THE WALLS AND FLOOR WERE COVERED WITH FAT BLACK BEETLES WHOLE FAMILIES OF WHICH
4520-1805-0014 INTERESTING SPECIMENS OF THE INSECT WORLD HE CRUNCHED REMORSELESSLY UNDER FOOT AND MASSACRED AT EVERY STEP AND GREAT DEPRAVED LOOKING RATS WITH FLASHING EYES AND SINISTER TEETH WHO MADE FRANTIC DIVES AND RUSHES AT HIM
4520-1805-0015 AND BIT AT HIS JACK BOOTS WITH FIERCE FURY THESE SMALL QUADRUPEDS REMINDED HIM FORCIBLY OF THE DWARF ESPECIALLY IN THE REGION OF THE EYES AND THE GENERAL EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE AND HE BEGAN TO REFLECT THAT IF THE DWARF'S SOUL
4520-1805-0016 PASSED AFTER DEATH INTO THE BODY OF ANY OTHER ANIMAL IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE INTO THAT OF A RAT HE HAD JUST COME TO THIS CONCLUSION AND WAS APPLYING THE FLAME OF THE CANDLE TO THE NOSE OF AN INQUISITIVE BEETLE
4520-1805-0017 WHEN IT STRUCK HIM HE HEARD VOICES IN ALTERCATION OUTSIDE HIS DOOR ONE CLEAR RINGING AND IMPERIOUS YET WITHAL FEMININE WAS CERTAINLY NOT HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THE SUBDUED AND RESPECTFUL VOICES THAT ANSWERED
4520-1805-0018 WERE THOSE OF HIS GUARDS AFTER A MOMENT HE HEARD THE SOUND OF THE WITHDRAWING BOLTS AND HIS HEART BEAT FAST SURELY HIS HALF HOUR HAD NOT ALREADY EXPIRED AND IF IT HAD WOULD SHE BE THE PERSON TO CONDUCT HIM TO DEATH
4520-1805-0019 THE DOOR OPENED A PUFF OF WIND EXTINGUISHED HIS CANDLE BUT NOT UNTIL HE HAD CAUGHT THE GLIMMER OF JEWELS THE SHINING OF GOLD AND THE FLUTTER OF LONG BLACK HAIR AND THEN SOME ONE CAME IN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED
4520-1805-0020 THE BOLTS SHOT BACK AND HE WAS ALONE WITH MIRANDA THE QUEEN THERE WAS NO TROUBLE ABOUT RECOGNISING HER FOR SHE CARRIED IN HER HAND A SMALL LAMP WHICH SHE HELD UP BETWEEN THEM THAT ITS RAYS MIGHT FALL DIRECTLY ON BOTH FACES
4520-1805-0021 EACH WAS RATHER WHITE PERHAPS AND ONE HEART WAS GOING FASTER THAN IT HAD EVER GONE BEFORE AND THAT ONE WAS DECIDEDLY NOT THE QUEEN'S SHE WAS DRESSED EXACTLY AS HE HAD SEEN HER IN PURPLE AND ERMINE
4520-1805-0022 IN JEWELS AND GOLD AND STRANGELY OUT OF PLACE SHE LOOKED THERE IN HER SPLENDID DRESS AND SPLENDID BEAUTY AMONG THE BLACK BEETLES AND RATS HER FACE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A DEAD BLANK WALL
4520-1805-0023 OR CUT OUT OF COLD WHITE STONE FOR ALL IT EXPRESSED AND AS SHE LIGHTLY HELD UP HER RICH ROBES IN ONE HAND AND IN THE OTHER BORE THE LIGHT THE DARK SHINING EYES WERE FIXED ON HIS FACE
4520-1805-0024 AND WERE AS BARREN OF INTEREST EAGERNESS COMPASSION TENDERNESS OR ANY OTHER FEELING AS THE SHINING BLACK GLASS ONES OF A WAX DOLL SO THEY STOOD LOOKING AT EACH OTHER FOR SOME TEN SECONDS OR SO AND THEN
4520-1805-0025 STILL LOOKING FULL AT HIM MIRANDA SPOKE AND HER VOICE WAS AS CLEAR AND EMOTIONLESS AS HER EYES WELL SIR NORMAN KINGSLEY I HAVE COME TO SEE YOU BEFORE YOU DIE
4520-1805-0026 MADAME HE STAMMERED SCARCELY KNOWING WHAT HE SAID YOU ARE KIND AM I PERHAPS YOU FORGET I SIGNED YOUR DEATH WARRANT PROBABLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE RISK OF YOUR OWN LIFE TO REFUSE
4520-1805-0027 FIFTY DEATH WARRANTS NOW AM I KIND VERY LIKELY IT WOULD HAVE AMOUNTED TO THE SAME THING IN THE END THEY WOULD KILL ME WHETHER YOU SIGNED IT OR NOT SO WHAT DOES IT MATTER
4520-1805-0028 WHICH WILL BE THIS NIGHT WEEK AND I WOULD HAVE INCURRED NEITHER RISK NOR DANGER BY REFUSING SIR NORMAN GLANCED ROUND THE DUNGEON AND SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS I DO NOT KNOW THAT THAT PROSPECT IS MUCH MORE INVITING THAN THE PRESENT ONE
4520-1805-0029 EVEN DEATH IS PREFERABLE TO A WEEK'S IMPRISONMENT IN A PLACE LIKE THIS
4520-1805-0030 MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED MADAME LOOK AT THIS STONE FLOOR THAT STONE ROOF THESE SOLID WALLS THAT BARRED AND MASSIVE DOOR REFLECT THAT I AM SOME FORTY FEET UNDER GROUND CANNOT PERFORM IMPOSSIBILITIES
4520-1805-0031 AND THEN ASK YOURSELF HOW SIR NORMAN HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF GOOD FAIRIES VISITING BRAVE KNIGHTS AND SETTING THEM FREE SIR NORMAN SMILED I AM AFRAID THE GOOD FAIRIES AND BRAVE KNIGHTS
4520-1805-0032 WENT THE WAY OF ALL FLESH WITH KING ARTHUR'S ROUND TABLE AND EVEN IF THEY WERE IN EXISTENCE NONE OF THEM WOULD TAKE THE TROUBLE TO LIMP DOWN SO FAR TO SAVE SUCH AN UNLUCKY DOG AS I THEN YOU FORGIVE ME FOR WHAT I HAVE DONE

4520-1805-0034 DO NOT MOCK ME HERE MY MAJESTY FORSOOTH YOU HAVE BUT FIFTEEN MINUTES TO LIVE IN THIS WORLD SIR NORMAN AND IF YOU HAVE NO BETTER WAY OF SPENDING THEM I WILL TELL YOU A STRANGE STORY MY OWN AND ALL ABOUT THIS PLACE
4520-1805-0035 MADAME THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD I WOULD LIKE SO MUCH TO HEAR YOU SHALL HEAR IT THEN AND IT MAY BEGUILE THE LAST SLOW MOMENTS OF TIME BEFORE YOU GO OUT INTO ETERNITY
4520-1805-0036 SHE SET HER LAMP DOWN ON THE FLOOR AMONG THE RATS AND BEETLES AND STOOD WATCHING THE SMALL RED FLAME A MOMENT WITH A GLOOMY DOWNCAST EYE AND SIR NORMAN GAZING ON THE BEAUTIFUL DARKENING FACE SO LIKE AND YET SO UNLIKE LEOLINE
4520-1805-0037 MEANTIME THE HALF HOUR SPED IN THE CRIMSON COURT THE LAST TRIAL WAS OVER AND LADY CASTLEMAINE A SLENDER LITTLE BEAUTY OF EIGHTEEN STOOD CONDEMNED TO DIE
4520-1805-0038 EXCLAIMED THE DWARF WITH SPRIGHTLY ANIMATION AND WHILE I GO TO THE CELL YOU FAIR LADIES AND YOU MY LORD WILL SEEK THE BLACK CHAMBER AND AWAIT OUR COMING THERE ORDERING ONE OF HIS ATTENDANTS TO PRECEDE HIM WITH A LIGHT
4520-1805-0039 THE DWARF SKIPPED JAUNTILY AWAY TO GLOAT OVER HIS VICTIM HE REACHED THE DUNGEON DOOR WHICH THE GUARDS WITH SOME TREPIDATION IN THEIR COUNTENANCE AS THEY THOUGHT OF WHAT HIS HIGHNESS WOULD SAY WHEN HE FOUND HER MAJESTY LOCKED IN WITH THE PRISONER
4520-1805-0040 NO SIR NORMAN KINGSLEY OBEYED THE PLEASANT INVITATION AND A DULL ECHO FROM THE DARKNESS ALONE ANSWERED HIM THERE WAS A LAMP BURNING ON THE FLOOR AND NEAR IT LAY A FORM SHINING
4520-1805-0041 AND SPECKED WITH WHITE IN THE GLOOM HE MADE FOR IT BETWEEN FEAR AND FURY BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING RED AND SLIPPERY ON THE GROUND IN WHICH HIS FOOT SLIPPED AND HE FELL SIMULTANEOUSLY THERE WAS A WILD CRY FROM THE TWO GUARDS AND THE ATTENDANT
4520-1805-0042 THAT WAS ECHOED BY A PERFECT SCREECH OF RAGE FROM THE DWARF AS ON LOOKING DOWN HE BEHELD QUEEN MIRANDA LYING ON THE FLOOR IN THE POOL OF BLOOD AND APPARENTLY QUITE DEAD
