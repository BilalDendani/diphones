3738-176683-0000 CLOUDS WERE GATHERING AS HALE RODE UP THE RIVER AFTER TELLING OLD HON AND UNCLE BILLY GOOD BY HE HAD MEANT NOT TO GO TO THE CABIN IN LONESOME COVE BUT WHEN HE REACHED THE FORKS OF THE ROAD
3738-176683-0001 AT A SLOW WALK HE WENT NOISELESSLY THROUGH THE DEEP SAND AROUND THE CLUMP OF RHODODENDRON THE CREEK WAS CLEAR AS CRYSTAL ONCE MORE BUT NO GEESE CACKLED AND NO DOG BARKED THE DOOR OF THE SPRING HOUSE GAPED WIDE
3738-176683-0002 THE BARN DOOR SAGGED ON ITS HINGES THE YARD FENCE SWAYED DRUNKENLY AND THE CABIN WAS STILL AS A GRAVESTONE BUT THE GARDEN WAS ALIVE AND HE SWUNG FROM HIS HORSE AT THE GATE
3738-176683-0003 AND WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED BEHIND HIS BACK WALKED SLOWLY THROUGH IT JUNE'S GARDEN THE GARDEN HE HAD PLANNED AND PLANTED FOR JUNE THAT THEY HAD TENDED TOGETHER AND APART AND THAT THANKS TO THE OLD MILLER'S CARE
3738-176683-0004 WAS THE ONE THING SAVE THE SKY ABOVE LEFT IN SPIRIT UNCHANGED THE PERIWINKLES PINK AND WHITE WERE ALMOST GONE THE FLAGS WERE AT HALF MAST AND SINKING FAST
3738-176683-0005 BUT THE PINKS WERE FRAGRANT THE POPPIES WERE POISED ON SLENDER STALKS LIKE BRILLIANT BUTTERFLIES AT REST THE HOLLYHOCKS SHOOK SOUNDLESS PINK BELLS TO THE WIND ROSES AS SCARLET AS JUNE'S LIPS BLOOMED EVERYWHERE
3738-176683-0006 LIKE WIND DRIVEN CLOUDS OF MIST THICKENING INTO WATER AS THEY CAME THE SHINGLES RATTLED AS THOUGH WITH THE HEAVY SLAPPING OF HANDS THE PINES CREAKED AND THE SUDDEN DUSK OUTSIDE MADE THE CABIN WHEN HE PUSHED THE DOOR OPEN AS DARK AS NIGHT
3738-176683-0007 KINDLING A FIRE HE LIT HIS PIPE AND WAITED THE ROOM WAS DAMP AND MUSTY BUT THE PRESENCE OF JUNE ALMOST SMOTHERED HIM ONCE HE TURNED HIS FACE JUNE'S DOOR WAS AJAR
3738-176683-0008 AND THE KEY WAS IN THE LOCK HE ROSE TO GO TO IT AND LOOK WITHIN AND THEN DROPPED HEAVILY BACK INTO HIS CHAIR HE WAS ANXIOUS TO GET AWAY NOW TO GET TO WORK SEVERAL TIMES HE ROSE RESTLESSLY AND LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW
3738-176683-0009 ONCE HE WENT OUTSIDE AND CREPT ALONG THE WALL OF THE CABIN TO THE EAST AND THE WEST BUT THERE WAS NO BREAK OF LIGHT IN THE MURKY SKY AND HE WENT BACK TO PIPE AND FIRE
3738-176683-0010 BY AND BY THE WIND DIED AND THE RAIN STEADIED INTO A DOGGED DOWNPOUR HE KNEW WHAT THAT MEANT THERE WOULD BE NO LETTING UP NOW IN THE STORM AND FOR ANOTHER NIGHT HE WAS A PRISONER
3738-176683-0011 AND PULLED OUT A CAKE OF CHOCOLATE A CAN OF POTTED HAM AND SOME CRACKERS MUNCHED HIS SUPPER WENT TO BED AND LAY THERE WITH SLEEPLESS EYES
3738-176683-0012 IN WHICH JUNE WAS THE CENTRAL FIGURE ALWAYS
3738-176683-0013 IN THE DREAM TRAGEDY FORMING IN HIS BRAIN THEY WERE MEETING FACE TO FACE AT LAST AND THE PLACE WAS THE BIG PINE DAVE'S PISTOL FLASHED AND HIS OWN STUCK IN THE HOLSTER AS HE TRIED TO DRAW THERE WAS A CRASHING REPORT
