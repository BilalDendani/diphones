3717-178149-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE HE HAD BEEN DROWNED HE WAS FLOATING IN A SEA OF LIGHT AND NOW AND THEN SHINING LITTLE FISHES SWAM INQUISITIVELY UP TO HIM AND STARED
3717-178149-0001 LEAVING A FLASHING WAKE BEHIND THEM THEY HURTLED THROUGH THE MURKY LIGHT LIKE SHOOTING STARS AND ONCE TWO OF THEM DASHED TOGETHER AND BURST LIKE A ROCKET
3717-178149-0002 THE SPARKS CAME FALLING DOWN THROUGH A BILLION MILES OF SPACE AND AS THEY FELL THEY BUILT UP PLANETS AND SYSTEMS OF THEIR OWN UNTIL A DARK COIL THAT HAD THE SHAPE OF A DRAGON SLITHERED ACROSS THE MILKY WAY
3717-178149-0003 MURMURING SOUND IT WAS NEITHER SAD NOR GLAD SOMETHING LIKE THE SOUND THAT THE LAST BEE OF AUTUMN MAKES
3717-178149-0004 SOMETHING WAS FALLING ACROSS THE BACK OF HIS NECK AND SPREADING OUT ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS LIKE A WOMAN'S HAIR HE THOUGHT PERHAPS IT WAS A BIT COARSER BUT NOT MUCH
3717-178149-0005 BUT THEN JUST AS THE STRANGE SOOTHING FEELING WAS PUTTING HIM BACK TO SLEEP THE HAIRS CHANGED THEIR SOFT CARESS AND A DOZEN OF THEM PLUNGED INTO HIS SPINAL CORD
3717-178149-0006 WHERE ALL THE BOGIES OF THE STONE AGE STILL COWERED ODIN YELLED IN PAIN AND FOUGHT BUT THE HANDS HELD HIM TIGHT IN HIS EARS HE COULD HEAR SOMEONE ELSE SCREAMING AND CURSING THREATENING ALL SORTS OF VENGEANCE
3717-178149-0007 THE VOICE WAS GUNNAR'S THREE TIMES MORE THE SOFT MANE OF HAIR CARESSED HIM AND THREE TIMES MORE JUST AS HE WAS GETTING READY TO GO BACK TO SLEEP THE TORTURE BEGAN
3717-178149-0008 AND ALL THE WHILE HE WAS LYING UPON HIS BELLY HIS FACE THRUST INTO A PILLOW
3717-178149-0009 THE HANDS HELD HIM SECURELY AND ONCE WHEN HE ALMOST STRUGGLED CLEAR A STRONG KNEE WAS THRUST INTO HIS BACK AND FORCED HIM DOWN AT INTERVALS HE COULD HEAR GUNNAR'S VOICE AND HIS OWN
3717-178149-0010 CRYING PLEADING THREATENING THEN AT LAST IT WAS OVER THE HANDS TURNED ODIN UPON HIS BACK AND HE LAY THERE GASPING AND HURTING LIKE ONE WHO HAS JUST COME UP FROM DEEP WATER
3717-178149-0011 THE LIGHTS WERE SO BRIGHT THAT AT FIRST HE COULD SEE NOTHING THEN HIS VISION CLEARED
3717-178149-0012 TRYING TO REASSURE HIM BESIDE ODIN ON ANOTHER BED WAS GUNNAR LYING FLAT ON HIS BACK AND STRIPPED TO THE WAIST GUNNAR WAS HOWLING CURSES AND KICKING LIKE A FROG A DOCTOR AND A NURSE WERE THERE
3717-178149-0013 AND FOR A SECOND SHE LOOKED LIKE A HIGH PRIESTESS OF THE AMAZON HOLDING TWO MUMMIFIED HEADS BEFORE HER THE PAIN LEFT HIM HIS MIND CLEARED AND HE LAY THERE GASPING FROM THE ORDEAL
3717-178149-0014 SO CHEERFULLY THAT HE ALMOST EXPECTED THEM TO WRITE OUT A BILL FOR SURGICAL FEES GOD THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE
