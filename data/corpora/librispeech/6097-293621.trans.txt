6097-293621-0001 TILL OUR FRIENDS ROSE UP IN WRATH AND THEY POINTED OUT THE PATH AND THEY PAID OUR DEBTS AND PACKED US O'ER THE SEA

6097-293621-0035 WHEN WE DRANK AND FOUGHT AND LUSTED AS WE MOCKED AT TIE AND TETHER ALONG THE ROAD TO ANYWHERE THE WIDE WORLD AT OUR FEET ALONG THE ROAD TO ANYWHERE WHEN EACH DAY HAD ITS STORY
6097-293621-0036 WHEN TIME WAS YET OUR VASSAL AND LIFE'S JEST WAS STILL UNSTALE
6097-293621-0037 ALONG THE ROAD TO ANYWHERE WE WATCHED THE SUNSETS PALE ALAS THE ROAD TO ANYWHERE IS PITFALLED WITH DISASTER THERE'S HUNGER WANT AND WEARINESS YET O WE LOVED IT SO
6097-293621-0038 AND NO MAN WAS OUR MASTER AND NO MAN GUESSED WHAT DREAMS WERE OURS AS SWINGING HEEL AND TOE WE TRAMPED THE ROAD TO ANYWHERE THE MAGIC ROAD TO ANYWHERE THE TRAGIC ROAD TO ANYWHERE SUCH DEAR DIM YEARS AGO
