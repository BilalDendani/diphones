1705-142318-0000 COWPER OF WHAT EACH ONE SHOULD BE HE SEES THE FORM AND RULE AND TILL HE REACH TO THAT HIS JOY CAN NE'ER BE FULL RUCKERT
1705-142318-0001 IT WAS VERY WELL FOR MARGARET THAT THE EXTREME QUIET OF THE HARLEY STREET HOUSE DURING EDITH'S RECOVERY FROM HER CONFINEMENT GAVE HER THE NATURAL REST WHICH SHE NEEDED IT GAVE HER TIME TO COMPREHEND THE SUDDEN CHANGE
1705-142318-0002 WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE IN HER CIRCUMSTANCES WITHIN THE LAST TWO MONTHS SHE FOUND HERSELF AT ONCE AN INMATE OF A LUXURIOUS HOUSE WHERE THE BARE KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXISTENCE OF EVERY TROUBLE OR CARE SEEMED SCARCELY TO HAVE PENETRATED
1705-142318-0003 THE WHEELS OF THE MACHINERY OF DAILY LIFE WERE WELL OILED AND WENT ALONG WITH DELICIOUS SMOOTHNESS MISSUS SHAW AND EDITH COULD HARDLY MAKE ENOUGH OF MARGARET ON HER RETURN TO WHAT THEY PERSISTED IN CALLING HER HOME
1705-142318-0004 AND SHE FELT THAT IT WAS ALMOST UNGRATEFUL IN HER TO HAVE A SECRET FEELING THAT THE HELSTONE VICARAGE NAY EVEN THE POOR LITTLE HOUSE AT MILTON WITH HER ANXIOUS FATHER AND HER INVALID MOTHER
1705-142318-0005 AND ALL THE SMALL HOUSEHOLD CARES OF COMPARATIVE POVERTY COMPOSED HER IDEA OF HOME EDITH WAS IMPATIENT TO GET WELL IN ORDER TO FILL MARGARET'S BED ROOM WITH ALL THE SOFT COMFORTS AND PRETTY NICK KNACKS WITH WHICH HER OWN ABOUNDED
1705-142318-0006 MISSUS SHAW AND HER MAID FOUND PLENTY OF OCCUPATION IN RESTORING MARGARET'S WARDROBE TO A STATE OF ELEGANT VARIETY CAPTAIN LENNOX WAS EASY KIND AND GENTLEMANLY
1705-142318-0007 SATE WITH HIS WIFE IN HER DRESSING ROOM AN HOUR OR TWO EVERY DAY PLAYED WITH HIS LITTLE BOY FOR ANOTHER HOUR AND LOUNGED AWAY THE REST OF HIS TIME AT HIS CLUB WHEN HE WAS NOT ENGAGED OUT TO DINNER
1705-142318-0008 JUST BEFORE MARGARET HAD RECOVERED FROM HER NECESSITY FOR QUIET AND REPOSE BEFORE SHE HAD BEGUN TO FEEL HER LIFE WANTING AND DULL EDITH CAME DOWN STAIRS AND RESUMED HER USUAL PART IN THE HOUSEHOLD
1705-142318-0009 AND MARGARET FELL INTO THE OLD HABIT OF WATCHING AND ADMIRING AND MINISTERING TO HER COUSIN SHE GLADLY TOOK ALL CHARGE OF THE SEMBLANCES OF DUTIES OFF EDITH'S HANDS ANSWERED NOTES REMINDED HER OF ENGAGEMENTS
1705-142318-0010 AND SHE WAS CONSEQUENTLY RATHER INCLINED TO FANCY HERSELF ILL BUT ALL THE REST OF THE FAMILY WERE IN THE FULL BUSINESS OF THE LONDON SEASON AND MARGARET WAS OFTEN LEFT ALONE THEN HER THOUGHTS WENT BACK TO MILTON
1705-142318-0011 WITH A STRANGE SENSE OF THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE LIFE THERE AND HERE SHE WAS GETTING SURFEITED OF THE EVENTLESS EASE IN WHICH NO STRUGGLE OR ENDEAVOUR WAS REQUIRED
1705-142318-0012 SHE WAS AFRAID LEST SHE SHOULD EVEN BECOME SLEEPILY DEADENED INTO FORGETFULNESS OF ANYTHING BEYOND THE LIFE WHICH WAS LAPPING HER ROUND WITH LUXURY THERE MIGHT BE TOILERS AND MOILERS THERE IN LONDON BUT SHE NEVER SAW THEM
1705-142318-0013 THE VERY SERVANTS LIVED IN AN UNDERGROUND WORLD OF THEIR OWN OF WHICH SHE KNEW NEITHER THE HOPES NOR THE FEARS THEY ONLY SEEMED TO START INTO EXISTENCE WHEN SOME WANT OR WHIM OF THEIR MASTER AND MISTRESS NEEDED THEM
1705-142318-0014 THERE WAS A STRANGE UNSATISFIED VACUUM IN MARGARET'S HEART AND MODE OF LIFE AND ONCE WHEN SHE HAD DIMLY HINTED THIS TO EDITH THE LATTER WEARIED WITH DANCING THE NIGHT BEFORE
1705-142318-0015 LANGUIDLY STROKED MARGARET'S CHEEK AS SHE SAT BY HER IN THE OLD ATTITUDE SHE ON A FOOTSTOOL BY THE SOFA WHERE EDITH LAY POOR CHILD SAID EDITH IT IS A LITTLE SAD FOR YOU TO BE LEFT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
1705-142318-0016 JUST AT THIS TIME WHEN ALL THE WORLD IS SO GAY BUT WE SHALL BE HAVING OUR DINNER PARTIES SOON AS SOON AS HENRY COMES BACK FROM CIRCUIT AND THEN THERE WILL BE A LITTLE PLEASANT VARIETY FOR YOU NO WONDER IT IS MOPED POOR DARLING
1705-142318-0017 MARGARET DID NOT FEEL AS IF THE DINNER PARTIES WOULD BE A PANACEA BUT EDITH PIQUED HERSELF ON HER DINNER PARTIES SO DIFFERENT AS SHE SAID FROM THE OLD DOWAGER DINNERS UNDER MAMMA'S REGIME
1705-142318-0018 AND MISSUS SHAW HERSELF SEEMED TO TAKE EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF PLEASURE IN THE VERY DIFFERENT ARRANGEMENTS AND CIRCLE OF ACQUAINTANCES WHICH WERE TO CAPTAIN AND MISSUS LENNOX'S TASTE AS SHE DID IN THE MORE FORMAL AND PONDEROUS ENTERTAINMENTS WHICH SHE HERSELF USED TO GIVE
1705-142318-0019 CAPTAIN LENNOX WAS ALWAYS EXTREMELY KIND AND BROTHERLY TO MARGARET SHE WAS REALLY VERY FOND OF HIM EXCEPTING WHEN HE WAS ANXIOUSLY ATTENTIVE TO EDITH'S DRESS AND APPEARANCE WITH A VIEW TO HER BEAUTY MAKING A SUFFICIENT IMPRESSION ON THE WORLD
1705-142318-0020 THEN ALL THE LATENT VASHTI IN MARGARET WAS ROUSED AND SHE COULD HARDLY KEEP HERSELF FROM EXPRESSING HER FEELINGS THE COURSE OF MARGARET'S DAY WAS THIS A QUIET HOUR OR TWO BEFORE A LATE BREAKFAST AN UNPUNCTUAL MEAL
1705-142318-0021 BUT YET AT WHICH IN ALL ITS DRAGGED OUT LENGTH SHE WAS EXPECTED TO BE PRESENT BECAUSE DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS CAME A DISCUSSION OF PLANS AT WHICH ALTHOUGH THEY NONE OF THEM CONCERNED HER SHE WAS EXPECTED TO GIVE HER SYMPATHY
1705-142318-0022 IF SHE COULD NOT ASSIST WITH HER ADVICE AN ENDLESS NUMBER OF NOTES TO WRITE WHICH EDITH INVARIABLY LEFT TO HER
1705-142318-0023 A LITTLE PLAY WITH SHOLTO AS HE RETURNED FROM HIS MORNING'S WALK BESIDES THE CARE OF THE CHILDREN DURING THE SERVANTS DINNER A DRIVE OR CALLERS AND SOME DINNER OR MORNING ENGAGEMENT FOR HER AUNT AND COUSINS WHICH LEFT MARGARET FREE IT IS TRUE
1705-142318-0024 BUT RATHER WEARIED WITH THE INACTIVITY OF THE DAY COMING UPON DEPRESSED SPIRITS AND DELICATE HEALTH SHE LOOKED FORWARD WITH LONGING THOUGH UNSPOKEN INTEREST TO THE HOMELY OBJECT OF DIXON'S RETURN FROM MILTON WHERE UNTIL NOW
1705-142318-0025 THE OLD SERVANT HAD BEEN BUSILY ENGAGED IN WINDING UP ALL THE AFFAIRS OF THE HALE FAMILY IT HAD APPEARED A SUDDEN FAMINE TO HER HEART THIS ENTIRE CESSATION OF ANY NEWS RESPECTING THE PEOPLE AMONGST WHOM SHE HAD LIVED SO LONG
1705-142318-0026 IT WAS TRUE THAT DIXON IN HER BUSINESS LETTERS QUOTED EVERY NOW AND THEN AN OPINION OF MISTER THORNTON'S AS TO WHAT SHE HAD BETTER DO ABOUT THE FURNITURE OR HOW ACT IN REGARD TO THE LANDLORD OF THE CRAMPTON TERRACE HOUSE
1705-142318-0027 BUT IT WAS ONLY HERE AND THERE THAT THE NAME CAME IN OR ANY MILTON NAME INDEED AND MARGARET WAS SITTING ONE EVENING ALL ALONE IN THE LENNOXES'S DRAWING ROOM NOT READING DIXON'S LETTERS WHICH YET SHE HELD IN HER HAND
1705-142318-0028 BUT THINKING OVER THEM AND RECALLING THE DAYS WHICH HAD BEEN AND PICTURING THE BUSY LIFE OUT OF WHICH HER OWN HAD BEEN TAKEN AND NEVER MISSED WONDERING IF ALL WENT ON IN THAT WHIRL JUST AS IF SHE AND HER FATHER HAD NEVER BEEN
1705-142318-0029 QUESTIONING WITHIN HERSELF IF NO ONE IN ALL THE CROWD MISSED HER NOT HIGGINS SHE WAS NOT THINKING OF HIM WHEN SUDDENLY MISTER BELL WAS ANNOUNCED AND MARGARET HURRIED THE LETTERS INTO HER WORK BASKET AND STARTED UP
1705-142318-0030 BLUSHING AS IF SHE HAD BEEN DOING SOME GUILTY THING OH MISTER BELL I NEVER THOUGHT OF SEEING YOU BUT YOU GIVE ME A WELCOME I HOPE AS WELL AS THAT VERY PRETTY START OF SURPRISE HAVE YOU DINED
1705-142318-0031 HOW DID YOU COME LET ME ORDER YOU SOME DINNER IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ANY OTHERWISE YOU KNOW THERE IS NO ONE WHO CARES LESS FOR EATING THAN I DO BUT WHERE ARE THE OTHERS GONE OUT TO DINNER LEFT YOU ALONE
1705-142318-0032 OH YES AND IT IS SUCH A REST I WAS JUST THINKING BUT WILL YOU RUN THE RISK OF DINNER I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN THE HOUSE WHY TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I DINED AT MY CLUB ONLY THEY DON'T COOK AS WELL AS THEY DID
1705-142318-0033 SO I THOUGHT IF YOU WERE GOING TO DINE I MIGHT TRY AND MAKE OUT MY DINNER BUT NEVER MIND NEVER MIND THERE AREN'T TEN COOKS IN ENGLAND TO BE TRUSTED AT IMPROMPTU DINNERS IF THEIR SKILL AND THEIR FIRES WILL STAND IT THEIR TEMPERS WON'T
1705-142318-0034 YOU SHALL MAKE ME SOME TEA MARGARET AND NOW WHAT WERE YOU THINKING OF YOU WERE GOING TO TELL ME WHOSE LETTERS WERE THOSE GOD DAUGHTER THAT YOU HID AWAY SO SPEEDILY ONLY DIXON'S REPLIED MARGARET
1705-142318-0035 GROWING VERY RED WHEW IS THAT ALL WHO DO YOU THINK CAME UP IN THE TRAIN WITH ME I DON'T KNOW SAID MARGARET RESOLVED AGAINST MAKING A GUESS
1705-142318-0036 WHAT'S THE RIGHT NAME FOR A COUSIN IN LAW'S BROTHER MISTER HENRY LENNOX ASKED MARGARET YES REPLIED MISTER BELL
1705-142318-0037 I LIKED HIM LONG AGO SAID MARGARET GLANCING DOWN FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SHE LOOKED STRAIGHT UP AND WENT ON IN HER NATURAL MANNER YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN CORRESPONDING ABOUT FREDERICK SINCE BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS
1705-142318-0038 AND HE MAY BE CHANGED WHAT DID YOU THINK OF HIM I DON'T KNOW HE WAS SO BUSY TRYING TO FIND OUT WHO I WAS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE AND WHAT I WAS IN THE SECOND THAT HE NEVER LET OUT WHAT HE WAS
1705-142318-0039 UNLESS INDEED THAT VEILED CURIOSITY OF HIS
1705-142318-0040 AND A FAIR INDICATION OF HIS CHARACTER DO YOU CALL HIM GOOD LOOKING MARGARET NO CERTAINLY NOT DO YOU NOT I BUT I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU MIGHT IS HE A GREAT DEAL HERE
1705-142318-0041 I FANCY HE IS WHEN HE IS IN TOWN HE HAS BEEN ON CIRCUIT NOW SINCE I CAME BUT MISTER BELL HAVE YOU COME FROM OXFORD OR FROM MILTON FROM MILTON DON'T YOU SEE I'M SMOKE DRIED CERTAINLY
1705-142318-0042 BUT I THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE THE EFFECT OF THE ANTIQUITIES OF OXFORD COME NOW BE A SENSIBLE WOMAN IN OXFORD I COULD HAVE MANAGED ALL THE LANDLORDS IN THE PLACE AND HAD MY OWN WAY
1705-142318-0043 WITH HALF THE TROUBLE YOUR MILTON LANDLORD HAS GIVEN ME AND DEFEATED ME AFTER ALL HE WON'T TAKE THE HOUSE OFF OUR HANDS TILL NEXT JUNE TWELVEMONTH LUCKILY MISTER THORNTON FOUND A TENANT FOR IT WHY DON'T YOU ASK AFTER MISTER THORNTON MARGARET
1705-142318-0044 HE HAS PROVED HIMSELF A VERY ACTIVE FRIEND OF YOURS I CAN TELL YOU TAKEN MORE THAN HALF THE TROUBLE OFF MY HANDS AND HOW IS HE HOW IS MISSUS THORNTON ASKED MARGARET HURRIEDLY AND BELOW HER BREATH THOUGH SHE TRIED TO SPEAK OUT
1705-142318-0045 I SUPPOSE THEY'RE WELL I'VE BEEN STAYING AT THEIR HOUSE TILL I WAS DRIVEN OUT OF IT BY THE PERPETUAL CLACK ABOUT THAT THORNTON GIRL'S MARRIAGE IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR THORNTON HIMSELF THOUGH SHE WAS HIS SISTER
1705-142318-0046 HE USED TO GO AND SIT IN HIS OWN ROOM PERPETUALLY HE'S GETTING PAST THE AGE FOR CARING FOR SUCH THINGS EITHER AS PRINCIPAL OR ACCESSORY
1705-142318-0047 SHE WOULD PUT ON ANY ASSUMPTION OF FEELING TO VEIL HER DAUGHTER'S WEAKNESS SAID MARGARET IN A LOW VOICE PERHAPS SO YOU'VE STUDIED HER HAVE YOU SHE DOESN'T SEEM OVER FOND OF YOU MARGARET I KNOW IT SAID MARGARET
1705-142318-0048 OH HERE IS TEA AT LAST EXCLAIMED SHE AS IF RELIEVED AND WITH TEA CAME MISTER HENRY LENNOX WHO HAD WALKED UP TO HARLEY STREET AFTER A LATE DINNER AND HAD EVIDENTLY EXPECTED TO FIND HIS BROTHER AND SISTER IN LAW AT HOME
1705-142318-0049 MARGARET SUSPECTED HIM OF BEING AS THANKFUL AS SHE WAS AT THE PRESENCE OF A THIRD PARTY ON THIS THEIR FIRST MEETING SINCE THE MEMORABLE DAY OF HIS OFFER AND HER REFUSAL AT HELSTONE SHE COULD HARDLY TELL WHAT TO SAY AT FIRST
1705-142318-0050 AND WAS THANKFUL FOR ALL THE TEA TABLE OCCUPATIONS WHICH GAVE HER AN EXCUSE FOR KEEPING SILENCE AND HIM AN OPPORTUNITY OF RECOVERING HIMSELF FOR TO TELL THE TRUTH HE HAD RATHER FORCED HIMSELF UP TO HARLEY STREET THIS EVENING
1705-142318-0051 WITH A VIEW OF GETTING OVER AN AWKWARD MEETING AWKWARD EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF CAPTAIN LENNOX AND EDITH AND DOUBLY AWKWARD NOW THAT HE FOUND HER THE ONLY LADY THERE AND THE PERSON TO WHOM HE MUST NATURALLY
1705-142318-0052 AND PERFORCE ADDRESS A GREAT PART OF HIS CONVERSATION SHE WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER HER SELF POSSESSION SHE BEGAN TO TALK ON THE SUBJECT WHICH CAME UPPERMOST IN HER MIND AFTER THE FIRST FLUSH OF AWKWARD SHYNESS MISTER LENNOX
1705-142318-0053 I HAVE BEEN SO MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR ALL YOU HAVE DONE ABOUT FREDERICK I AM ONLY SORRY IT HAS BEEN SO UNSUCCESSFUL REPLIED HE WITH A QUICK GLANCE TOWARDS MISTER BELL AS IF RECONNOITRING HOW MUCH HE MIGHT SAY BEFORE HIM
1705-142318-0054 MARGARET AS IF SHE READ HIS THOUGHT ADDRESSED HERSELF TO MISTER BELL BOTH INCLUDING HIM IN THE CONVERSATION AND IMPLYING THAT HE WAS PERFECTLY AWARE OF THE ENDEAVOURS THAT HAD BEEN MADE TO CLEAR FREDERICK THAT HORROCKS
1705-142318-0055 THAT VERY LAST WITNESS OF ALL HAS PROVED AS UNAVAILING AS ALL THE OTHERS MISTER LENNOX HAS DISCOVERED THAT HE SAILED FOR AUSTRALIA ONLY LAST AUGUST ONLY TWO MONTHS BEFORE FREDERICK WAS IN ENGLAND AND GAVE US THE NAMES OF
1705-142318-0056 FREDERICK IN ENGLAND YOU NEVER TOLD ME THAT EXCLAIMED MISTER BELL IN SURPRISE I THOUGHT YOU KNEW I NEVER DOUBTED YOU HAD BEEN TOLD OF COURSE IT WAS A GREAT SECRET AND PERHAPS I SHOULD NOT HAVE NAMED IT NOW
1705-142318-0057 SAID MARGARET A LITTLE DISMAYED I HAVE NEVER NAMED IT TO EITHER MY BROTHER OR YOUR COUSIN SAID MISTER LENNOX WITH A LITTLE PROFESSIONAL DRYNESS OF IMPLIED REPROACH NEVER MIND MARGARET
1705-142318-0058 I AM NOT LIVING IN A TALKING BABBLING WORLD NOR YET AMONG PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO WORM FACTS OUT OF ME YOU NEEDN'T LOOK SO FRIGHTENED BECAUSE YOU HAVE LET THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG TO A FAITHFUL OLD HERMIT LIKE ME
1705-142318-0059 I SHALL NEVER NAME HIS HAVING BEEN IN ENGLAND I SHALL BE OUT OF TEMPTATION FOR NO ONE WILL ASK ME STAY INTERRUPTING HIMSELF RATHER ABRUPTLY WAS IT AT YOUR MOTHER'S FUNERAL
1705-142318-0060 HE WAS WITH MAMMA WHEN SHE DIED SAID MARGARET SOFTLY TO BE SURE TO BE SURE WHY SOME ONE ASKED ME IF HE HAD NOT BEEN OVER THEN
1705-142318-0061 WHO COULD IT HAVE BEEN OH I RECOLLECT BUT HE DID NOT SAY THE NAME AND ALTHOUGH MARGARET WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO KNOW IF HER SUSPICIONS WERE RIGHT AND IT HAD BEEN MISTER THORNTON WHO HAD MADE THE ENQUIRY
1705-142318-0062 SHE COULD NOT ASK THE QUESTION OF MISTER BELL MUCH AS SHE LONGED TO DO SO THERE WAS A PAUSE FOR A MOMENT OR TWO THEN MISTER LENNOX SAID ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO MARGARET
1705-142318-0063 I SUPPOSE AS MISTER BELL IS NOW ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING YOUR BROTHER'S UNFORTUNATE DILEMMA I CANNOT DO BETTER THAN INFORM HIM EXACTLY HOW THE RESEARCH INTO THE EVIDENCE WE ONCE HOPED TO PRODUCE IN HIS FAVOUR STANDS AT PRESENT
1705-142318-0064 SO IF HE WILL DO ME THE HONOUR TO BREAKFAST WITH ME TO MORROW WE WILL GO OVER THE NAMES OF THESE MISSING GENTRY I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR ALL THE PARTICULARS IF I MAY CANNOT YOU COME HERE
1705-142318-0065 I DARE NOT ASK YOU BOTH TO BREAKFAST THOUGH I AM SURE YOU WOULD BE WELCOME BUT LET ME KNOW ALL I CAN ABOUT FREDERICK EVEN THOUGH THERE MAY BE NO HOPE AT PRESENT I HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT AT HALF PAST ELEVEN
1705-142318-0066 BUT I WILL CERTAINLY COME IF YOU WISH IT REPLIED MISTER LENNOX WITH A LITTLE AFTERTHOUGHT OF EXTREME WILLINGNESS WHICH MADE MARGARET SHRINK INTO HERSELF AND ALMOST WISH THAT SHE HAD NOT PROPOSED HER NATURAL REQUEST
1705-142318-0067 MISTER BELL GOT UP AND LOOKED AROUND HIM FOR HIS HAT WHICH HAD BEEN REMOVED TO MAKE ROOM FOR TEA
1705-142318-0068 BUT I'M DISPOSED TO BE MOVING OFF HOMEWARDS I'VE BEEN A JOURNEY TO DAY AND JOURNEYS BEGIN TO TELL UPON MY SIXTY AND ODD YEARS I BELIEVE I SHALL STAY AND SEE MY BROTHER AND SISTER SAID MISTER LENNOX
1705-142318-0069 MAKING NO MOVEMENT OF DEPARTURE MARGARET WAS SEIZED WITH A SHY AWKWARD DREAD OF BEING LEFT ALONE WITH HIM THE SCENE ON THE LITTLE TERRACE IN THE HELSTONE GARDEN WAS SO PRESENT TO HER THAT SHE COULD HARDLY HELP BELIEVING IT WAS SO WITH HIM
1705-142318-0070 HE LOOKED AT HER AND SAW THE CONFUSION STIRRING IN HER COUNTENANCE HE SATE DOWN AGAIN AS IF HER LITTLE TOUCH HAD BEEN POSSESSED OF RESISTLESS STRENGTH YOU SEE HOW SHE OVERPOWERS ME MISTER LENNOX SAID HE
1705-142318-0071 AND I HOPE YOU NOTICED THE HAPPY CHOICE OF HER EXPRESSIONS SHE WANTS ME TO SEE THIS COUSIN EDITH WHO I AM TOLD IS A GREAT BEAUTY
1705-142318-0072 MISSUS LENNOX IS TO KNOW ME
1705-142318-0073 HE JOKED TO GIVE HER TIME TO RECOVER FROM THE SLIGHT FLUTTER WHICH HE HAD DETECTED IN HER MANNER ON HIS PROPOSAL TO LEAVE AND SHE CAUGHT THE TONE AND THREW THE BALL BACK MISTER LENNOX WONDERED HOW HIS BROTHER THE CAPTAIN
1705-142318-0074 COULD HAVE REPORTED HER AS HAVING LOST ALL HER GOOD LOOKS TO BE SURE IN HER QUIET BLACK DRESS SHE WAS A CONTRAST TO EDITH DANCING IN HER WHITE CRAPE MOURNING AND LONG FLOATING GOLDEN HAIR ALL SOFTNESS AND GLITTER
1705-142318-0075 SHE DIMPLED AND BLUSHED MOST BECOMINGLY WHEN INTRODUCED TO MISTER BELL CONSCIOUS THAT SHE HAD HER REPUTATION AS A BEAUTY TO KEEP UP AND THAT IT WOULD NOT DO TO HAVE A MORDECAI REFUSING TO WORSHIP AND ADMIRE
1705-142318-0076 EVEN IN THE SHAPE OF AN OLD FELLOW OF A COLLEGE WHICH NOBODY HAD EVER HEARD OF MISSUS SHAW AND CAPTAIN LENNOX EACH IN THEIR SEPARATE WAY GAVE MISTER BELL A KIND AND SINCERE WELCOME
1705-142318-0077 WINNING HIM OVER TO LIKE THEM ALMOST IN SPITE OF HIMSELF ESPECIALLY WHEN HE SAW HOW NATURALLY MARGARET TOOK HER PLACE AS SISTER AND DAUGHTER OF THE HOUSE WHAT A SHAME THAT WE WERE NOT AT HOME TO RECEIVE YOU SAID EDITH YOU TOO HENRY
1705-142318-0078 AND FOR MISTER BELL FOR MARGARET'S MISTER BELL THERE IS NO KNOWING WHAT SACRIFICES YOU WOULD NOT HAVE MADE SAID HER BROTHER IN LAW EVEN A DINNER PARTY AND THE DELIGHT OF WEARING THIS VERY BECOMING DRESS
1705-142318-0079 EDITH DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO FROWN OR TO SMILE BUT IT DID NOT SUIT MISTER LENNOX TO DRIVE HER TO THE FIRST OF THESE ALTERNATIVES SO HE WENT ON WILL YOU SHOW YOUR READINESS TO MAKE SACRIFICES TO MORROW MORNING
1705-142318-0080 FIRST BY ASKING ME TO BREAKFAST TO MEET MISTER BELL AND SECONDLY BY BEING SO KIND AS TO ORDER IT AT HALF PAST NINE INSTEAD OF TEN O'CLOCK I HAVE SOME LETTERS AND PAPERS
1705-142318-0081 I HOPE MISTER BELL WILL MAKE OUR HOUSE HIS OWN DURING HIS STAY IN LONDON SAID CAPTAIN LENNOX I AM ONLY SO SORRY WE CANNOT OFFER HIM A BED ROOM THANK YOU I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
1705-142318-0082 IN SPITE OF ALL THE TEMPTATIONS OF SUCH AGREEABLE COMPANY SAID MISTER BELL BOWING ALL ROUND AND SECRETLY CONGRATULATING HIMSELF ON THE NEAT TURN HE HAD GIVEN TO HIS SENTENCE WHICH IF PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE
1705-142318-0083 WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO THIS EFFECT I COULDN'T STAND THE RESTRAINTS OF SUCH A PROPER BEHAVED AND CIVIL SPOKEN SET OF PEOPLE AS THESE ARE IT WOULD BE LIKE MEAT WITHOUT SALT I'M THANKFUL THEY HAVEN'T A BED
1705-142318-0084 AND HOW WELL I ROUNDED MY SENTENCE I AM ABSOLUTELY CATCHING THE TRICK OF GOOD MANNERS HIS SELF SATISFACTION LASTED HIM TILL HE WAS FAIRLY OUT IN THE STREETS WALKING SIDE BY SIDE WITH HENRY LENNOX
1705-142318-0085 HERE HE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED MARGARET'S LITTLE LOOK OF ENTREATY AS SHE URGED HIM TO STAY LONGER AND HE ALSO RECOLLECTED A FEW HINTS GIVEN HIM LONG AGO BY AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MISTER LENNOX'S AS TO HIS ADMIRATION OF MARGARET
1705-142318-0086 IT GAVE A NEW DIRECTION TO HIS THOUGHTS YOU HAVE KNOWN MISS HALE FOR A LONG TIME I BELIEVE
1705-142318-0087 SHE STRIKES ME AS PALE AND ILL I THOUGHT HER LOOKING REMARKABLY WELL PERHAPS NOT WHEN I FIRST CAME IN NOW I THINK OF IT BUT CERTAINLY WHEN SHE GREW ANIMATED SHE LOOKED AS WELL AS EVER I SAW HER DO
1705-142318-0088 SHE HAS HAD A GREAT DEAL TO GO THROUGH SAID MISTER BELL YES I HAVE BEEN SORRY TO HEAR OF ALL SHE HAS HAD TO BEAR NOT MERELY THE COMMON AND UNIVERSAL SORROW ARISING FROM DEATH
1705-142318-0089 BUT ALL THE ANNOYANCE WHICH HER FATHER'S CONDUCT MUST HAVE CAUSED HER AND THEN HER FATHER'S CONDUCT SAID MISTER BELL IN AN ACCENT OF SURPRISE YOU MUST HAVE HEARD SOME WRONG STATEMENT HE BEHAVED IN THE MOST CONSCIENTIOUS MANNER
1705-142318-0090 PERHAPS I HAVE BEEN WRONGLY INFORMED BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY HIS SUCCESSOR IN THE LIVING A CLEVER SENSIBLE MAN AND A THOROUGHLY ACTIVE CLERGYMAN THAT THERE WAS NO CALL UPON MISTER HALE TO DO WHAT HE DID RELINQUISH THE LIVING
1705-142318-0091 AND THROW HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY ON THE TENDER MERCIES OF PRIVATE TEACHING IN A MANUFACTURING TOWN THE BISHOP HAD OFFERED HIM ANOTHER LIVING IT IS TRUE BUT IF HE HAD COME TO ENTERTAIN CERTAIN DOUBTS HE COULD HAVE REMAINED WHERE HE WAS
1705-142318-0092 AND SO HAD NO OCCASION TO RESIGN BUT THE TRUTH IS THESE COUNTRY CLERGYMEN LIVE SUCH ISOLATED LIVES ISOLATED I MEAN FROM ALL INTERCOURSE WITH MEN OF EQUAL CULTIVATION WITH THEMSELVES BY WHOSE MINDS THEY MIGHT REGULATE THEIR OWN
1705-142318-0093 THAT THEY ARE VERY APT TO DISTURB THEMSELVES WITH IMAGINARY DOUBTS AS TO THE ARTICLES OF FAITH AND THROW UP CERTAIN OPPORTUNITIES OF DOING GOOD FOR VERY UNCERTAIN FANCIES OF THEIR OWN
1705-142318-0094 I DIFFER FROM YOU I DO NOT THINK THEY ARE VERY APT TO DO AS MY POOR FRIEND HALE DID MISTER BELL WAS INWARDLY CHAFING PERHAPS I USED TOO GENERAL AN EXPRESSION IN SAYING VERY APT
1705-142318-0095 BUT CERTAINLY THEIR LIVES ARE SUCH AS VERY OFTEN TO PRODUCE EITHER INORDINATE SELF SUFFICIENCY OR A MORBID STATE OF CONSCIENCE REPLIED MISTER LENNOX WITH PERFECT COOLNESS YOU DON'T MEET WITH ANY SELF SUFFICIENCY AMONG THE LAWYERS FOR INSTANCE
1705-142318-0096 ASKED MISTER BELL AND SELDOM I IMAGINE ANY CASES OF MORBID CONSCIENCE HE WAS BECOMING MORE AND MORE VEXED AND FORGETTING HIS LATELY CAUGHT TRICK OF GOOD MANNERS MISTER LENNOX SAW NOW THAT HE HAD ANNOYED HIS COMPANION
1705-142318-0097 AND AS HE HAD TALKED PRETTY MUCH FOR THE SAKE OF SAYING SOMETHING AND SO PASSING THE TIME WHILE THEIR ROAD LAY TOGETHER HE WAS VERY INDIFFERENT AS TO THE EXACT SIDE HE TOOK UPON THE QUESTION AND QUIETLY CAME ROUND BY SAYING
1705-142318-0098 TO BE SURE THERE IS SOMETHING FINE IN A MAN OF MISTER HALE'S AGE LEAVING HIS HOME OF TWENTY YEARS AND GIVING UP ALL SETTLED HABITS FOR AN IDEA WHICH WAS PROBABLY ERRONEOUS BUT THAT DOES NOT MATTER AN UNTANGIBLE THOUGHT
1705-142318-0099 ONE CANNOT HELP ADMIRING HIM WITH A MIXTURE OF PITY IN ONE'S ADMIRATION SOMETHING LIKE WHAT ONE FEELS FOR DON QUIXOTE SUCH A GENTLEMAN AS HE WAS TOO I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE REFINED AND SIMPLE HOSPITALITY HE SHOWED TO ME
1705-142318-0100 THAT LAST DAY AT HELSTONE ONLY HALF MOLLIFIED AND YET ANXIOUS IN ORDER TO LULL CERTAIN QUALMS OF HIS OWN CONSCIENCE
1705-142318-0101 MISTER BELL GROWLED OUT
1705-142318-0102 SUCH A CHANGE FROM HELSTONE IT IS YEARS SINCE I HAVE BEEN AT HELSTONE BUT I'LL ANSWER FOR IT IT IS STANDING THERE YET EVERY STICK AND EVERY STONE AS IT HAS DONE FOR THE LAST CENTURY WHILE MILTON I GO THERE EVERY FOUR OR FIVE YEARS
1705-142318-0103 AND I WAS BORN THERE YET I DO ASSURE YOU I OFTEN LOSE MY WAY AYE AMONG THE VERY PILES OF WAREHOUSES THAT ARE BUILT UPON MY FATHER'S ORCHARD DO WE PART HERE
