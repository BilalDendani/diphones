925-8141-0000 SO MUCH FOR THE ANALYSIS OF LOVE NOW THE BUSINESS OF OUR LIVES IS TO HAVE THESE THINGS FITTED INTO OUR CHARACTERS
925-8141-0001 TO LEARN LOVE IS LIFE NOT FULL OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNING LOVE EVERY MAN AND WOMAN EVERY DAY HAS A THOUSAND OF THEM THE WORLD IS NOT A PLAYGROUND IT IS A SCHOOLROOM
925-8141-0002 LIFE IS NOT A HOLIDAY BUT AN EDUCATION AND THE ONE ETERNAL LESSON FOR US ALL IS HOW BETTER WE CAN LOVE WHAT MAKES A MAN A GOOD CRICKETER
925-8141-0003 PRACTICE WHAT MAKES A MAN A GOOD ARTIST A GOOD SCULPTOR A GOOD MUSICIAN PRACTICE WHAT MAKES A MAN A GOOD LINGUIST A GOOD STENOGRAPHER PRACTICE
925-8141-0004 WHAT MAKES A MAN A GOOD MAN PRACTICE NOTHING ELSE THERE IS NOTHING CAPRICIOUS ABOUT RELIGION WE DO NOT GET THE SOUL IN DIFFERENT WAYS UNDER DIFFERENT LAWS
925-8141-0005 FROM THOSE IN WHICH WE GET THE BODY AND THE MIND IF A MAN DOES NOT EXERCISE HIS ARM HE DEVELOPS NO BICEPS MUSCLE AND IF A MAN DOES NOT EXERCISE HIS SOUL
925-8141-0006 HE ACQUIRES NO MUSCLE IN HIS SOUL NO STRENGTH OF CHARACTER NO VIGOR OF MORAL FIBRE NO BEAUTY OF SPIRITUAL GROWTH LOVE IS NOT A THING OF ENTHUSIASTIC EMOTION
925-8141-0007 IT IS A RICH STRONG MANLY VIGOROUS EXPRESSION OF THE WHOLE ROUND CHRISTIAN CHARACTER THE CHRISTLIKE NATURE IN ITS FULLEST DEVELOPMENT
925-8141-0008 AND THE CONSTITUENTS OF THIS GREAT CHARACTER ARE ONLY TO BE BUILT UP BY CEASELESS PRACTICE WHAT WAS CHRIST DOING IN THE CARPENTER'S SHOP PRACTISING
925-8141-0009 THOUGH PERFECT WE READ THAT HE LEARNED OBEDIENCE
925-8141-0010 DO NOT QUARREL THEREFORE WITH YOUR LOT IN LIFE DO NOT COMPLAIN OF ITS NEVER CEASING CARES ITS PETTY ENVIRONMENT THE VEXATIONS YOU HAVE TO STAND
925-8141-0011 THE SMALL AND SORDID SOULS YOU HAVE TO LIVE AND WORK WITH ABOVE ALL DO NOT RESENT TEMPTATION DO NOT BE PERPLEXED BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO THICKEN ROUND YOU MORE AND MORE
925-8141-0012 AND CEASES NEITHER FOR EFFORT NOR FOR AGONY
925-8141-0013 AND IT IS HAVING ITS WORK IN MAKING YOU PATIENT AND HUMBLE AND GENEROUS AND UNSELFISH AND KIND AND COURTEOUS
925-8141-0014 DO NOT GRUDGE THE HAND THAT IS MOULDING THE STILL TOO SHAPELESS IMAGE WITHIN YOU IT IS GROWING MORE BEAUTIFUL THOUGH YOU SEE IT NOT AND EVERY TOUCH OF TEMPTATION
925-8141-0015 MAY ADD TO ITS PERFECTION THEREFORE KEEP IN THE MIDST OF LIFE DO NOT ISOLATE YOURSELF BE AMONG MEN AND AMONG THINGS
925-8141-0016 AND AMONG TROUBLES AND DIFFICULTIES AND OBSTACLES
925-8141-0017 CHARACTER IN THE STREAM OF LIFE TALENT DEVELOPS ITSELF IN SOLITUDE THE TALENT OF PRAYER OF FAITH OF MEDITATION OF SEEING THE UNSEEN
925-8141-0018 CHARACTER GROWS IN THE STREAM OF THE WORLD'S LIFE THAT CHIEFLY IS WHERE MEN ARE TO LEARN LOVE HOW NOW HOW
925-8141-0019 TO MAKE IT EASIER I HAVE NAMED A FEW OF THE ELEMENTS OF LOVE BUT THESE ARE ONLY ELEMENTS LOVE ITSELF CAN NEVER BE DEFINED
925-8141-0020 LIGHT IS A SOMETHING MORE THAN THE SUM OF ITS INGREDIENTS A GLOWING DAZZLING TREMULOUS ETHER AND LOVE IS SOMETHING MORE THAN ALL ITS ELEMENTS
925-8141-0021 A PALPITATING QUIVERING SENSITIVE LIVING THING BY SYNTHESIS OF ALL THE COLORS MEN CAN MAKE WHITENESS THEY CANNOT MAKE LIGHT
925-8141-0022 BY SYNTHESIS OF ALL THE VIRTUES MEN CAN MAKE VIRTUE THEY CANNOT MAKE LOVE HOW THEN ARE WE TO HAVE THIS TRANSCENDENT LIVING WHOLE
925-8141-0023 CONVEYED INTO OUR SOULS WE BRACE OUR WILLS TO SECURE IT WE TRY TO COPY THOSE WHO HAVE IT WE LAY DOWN RULES ABOUT IT WE WATCH WE PRAY
925-8141-0024 BUT THESE THINGS ALONE WILL NOT BRING LOVE INTO OUR NATURE LOVE IS AN EFFECT AND ONLY AS WE FULFILL THE RIGHT CONDITION
925-8141-0025 CAN WE HAVE THE EFFECT PRODUCED SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT THE CAUSE IS IF YOU TURN TO THE REVISED VERSION OF THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN
925-8141-0026 WE LOVE BECAUSE HE FIRST LOVED US WE LOVE NOT WE LOVE HIM THAT IS THE WAY THE OLD VERSION HAS IT AND IT IS QUITE WRONG
925-8141-0027 WE LOVE BECAUSE HE FIRST LOVED US LOOK AT THAT WORD BECAUSE IT IS THE CAUSE OF WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN
925-8141-0028 BECAUSE HE FIRST LOVED US THE EFFECT FOLLOWS THAT WE LOVE WE LOVE HIM WE LOVE ALL MEN WE CANNOT HELP IT
925-8141-0029 OUR HEART IS SLOWLY CHANGED CONTEMPLATE THE LOVE OF CHRIST AND YOU WILL LOVE STAND BEFORE THAT MIRROR
925-8141-0030 REFLECT CHRIST'S CHARACTER AND YOU WILL BE CHANGED INTO THE SAME IMAGE FROM TENDERNESS TO TENDERNESS THERE IS NO OTHER WAY YOU CANNOT LOVE TO ORDER
925-8141-0031 YOU CAN ONLY LOOK AT THE LOVELY OBJECT AND FALL IN LOVE WITH IT AND GROW INTO LIKENESS TO IT AND SO LOOK AT THIS PERFECT CHARACTER
925-8141-0032 AND YOU MUST LOVE HIM AND LOVING HIM YOU MUST BECOME LIKE HIM LOVE BEGETS LOVE IT IS A PROCESS OF INDUCTION
925-8141-0033 THEY ARE BOTH MAGNETS ALIKE REMAIN SIDE BY SIDE WITH HIM WHO LOVED US AND GAVE HIMSELF FOR US
925-8141-0034 LIKE HIM YOU WILL BE DRAWN UNTO ALL MEN THAT IS THE INEVITABLE EFFECT OF LOVE ANY MAN WHO FULFILLS THAT CAUSE
925-8141-0035 MUST HAVE THAT EFFECT PRODUCED IN HIM TRY TO GIVE UP THE IDEA THAT RELIGION COMES TO US BY CHANCE OR BY MYSTERY OR BY CAPRICE IT COMES TO US BY NATURAL LAW
925-8141-0036 AND WHEN HE ENTERED THE ROOM HE JUST PUT HIS HAND ON THE SUFFERER'S HEAD AND SAID MY BOY GOD LOVES YOU AND WENT AWAY
925-8141-0037 AND CALLED OUT TO THE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE GOD LOVES ME
925-8141-0038 THE SENSE THAT GOD LOVED HIM OVERPOWERED HIM MELTED HIM DOWN
925-8141-0039 AND THAT IS HOW THE LOVE OF GOD MELTS DOWN THE UNLOVELY HEART IN MAN AND BEGETS IN HIM THE NEW CREATURE WHO IS PATIENT AND HUMBLE AND GENTLE AND UNSELFISH
925-8141-0040 AND THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO GET IT THERE IS NO MYSTERY ABOUT IT WE LOVE OTHERS WE LOVE EVERYBODY WE LOVE OUR ENEMIES
