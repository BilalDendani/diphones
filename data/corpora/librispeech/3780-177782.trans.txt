3780-177782-0000 THE COLT'S LEGS REMAINED SOUND AND THREE DAYS OF SUNSHINE WOULD MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR SUM OF HAPPINESS IN THE KITCHEN MISSUS LATCH AND ESTHER HAD BEEN BUSY FOR SOME TIME WITH CHICKENS AND PIES AND JELLIES
3780-177782-0001 AND IN THE PASSAGE THERE WERE CASES PACKED WITH FRUIT AND WINE THE DRESSMAKER HAD COME FROM WORTHING AND FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE YOUNG LADIES HAD NOT LEFT HER AND ONE FINE MORNING VERY EARLY ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK THE WHEELERS WERE BACKED INTO THE DRAG THAT HAD COME FROM BRIGHTON
3780-177782-0002 AND THE YARD RESOUNDED WITH THE BLARING OF THE HORN GINGER WAS PRACTISING UNDER HIS SISTER'S WINDOW YOU'LL BE LATE YOU'LL BE LATE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO YOUNG GENTLEMEN WHO HAD COME AT THE INVITATION OF THE YOUNG LADIES IT WAS QUITE A FAMILY PARTY
3780-177782-0003 MISS MARY SAT BESIDE HER FATHER ON THE BOX AND LOOKED VERY CHARMING IN WHITE AND BLUE PEGGY'S BLACK HAIR SEEMED BLACKER THAN EVER UNDER A WHITE SILK PARASOL WHICH SHE WAVED NEGLIGENTLY ABOVE HER AS SHE STOOD UP CALLING AND TALKING TO EVERYONE
3780-177782-0004 UNTIL THE GAFFER TOLD HER ANGRILY TO SIT DOWN AS HE WAS GOING TO START THEN WILLIAM AND THE COACHMAN LET GO THE LEADERS HEADS AND RUNNING SIDE BY SIDE SWUNG THEMSELVES INTO THEIR SEATS AT THE SAME MOMENT A GLIMPSE WAS CAUGHT OF MISTER LEOPOLD'S SALLOW PROFILE
3780-177782-0005 AMID THE BOXES AND THE MACKINTOSHES THAT FILLED THE INSIDE OF THE COACH OH WILLIAM DID LOOK THAT HANDSOME IN THOSE BEAUTIFUL NEW CLOTHES EVERYONE SAID SO SARAH AND MARGARET AND MISS GROVER I'M SORRY YOU DID NOT COME OUT TO SEE HIM
3780-177782-0006 MISSUS LATCH MADE NO ANSWER AND ESTHER REMEMBERED HOW SHE HATED HER SON TO WEAR LIVERY AND THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD PERHAPS MADE A MISTAKE IN SAYING THAT MISSUS LATCH SHOULD HAVE COME OUT TO SEE HIM PERHAPS THIS WILL MAKE HER DISLIKE ME AGAIN
3780-177782-0007 THOUGHT THE GIRL MISSUS LATCH MOVED ABOUT RAPIDLY AND SHE OPENED AND CLOSED THE OVEN THEN RAISING HER EYES TO THE WINDOW
3780-177782-0008 OH HOW SHOULD I KNOW MISSUS LATCH BUT THE HORSE IS CERTAIN TO WIN CERTAIN TO WIN I HAVE HEARD THAT TALE BEFORE
3780-177782-0009 SO THEY HAVE WON YOU ROUND TO THEIR WAY OF THINKING HAVE THEY SAID MISSUS LATCH STRAIGHTENING HER BACK I KNOW VERY WELL INDEED THAT IT IS NOT RIGHT TO BET BUT WHAT CAN I DO A POOR GIRL LIKE ME IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR WILLIAM
3780-177782-0010 HE HAS BEEN VERY KIND TO ME HE WAS KIND WHEN YES I KNOW WHEN I WAS UNKIND
3780-177782-0011 YOU DON'T KNOW ALL I WAS MUCH TROUBLED AT THAT TIME AND SOMEHOW I DID NOT BUT THERE IS NO ILL FEELING I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO BE A COOK OH MISSUS LATCH
3780-177782-0012 I AM SURE NEVER MIND THAT WHEN YOU WENT OUT TO WALK WITH HIM THE OTHER NIGHT DID HE TELL YOU THAT HE HAD MANY BETS ON THE RACE HE TALKED ABOUT THE RACE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE BUT HE DID NOT TELL ME WHAT BETS HE HAD ON NO
3780-177782-0013 THEY NEVER DO DO THAT BUT YOU'LL NOT TELL HIM THAT I ASKED YOU NO MISSUS LATCH I PROMISE IT WOULD DO NO GOOD HE'D ONLY BE ANGRY IT WOULD ONLY SET HIM AGAINST ME I AM AFRAID THAT NOTHING WILL STOP HIM NOW
3780-177782-0014 IS LIKE DRINK I WISH HE WAS MARRIED THAT MIGHT GET HIM OUT OF IT
3780-177782-0015 SOME STRONG MINDED WOMAN I THOUGHT ONCE THAT YOU WERE STRONG MINDED AT THAT MOMENT SARAH AND GROVER ENTERED THE KITCHEN TALKING LOUDLY THEY ASKED MISSUS LATCH HOW SOON THEY COULD HAVE DINNER THE SOONER THE BETTER
3780-177782-0016 FOR THE SAINT HAD TOLD THEM THAT THEY WERE FREE TO GO OUT FOR THE DAY
3780-177782-0017 THAT WAS ALL AH THE SAINT WAS A FIRST RATE SORT SHE HAD SAID THAT SHE DID NOT WANT ANYONE TO ATTEND ON HER SHE WOULD GET HERSELF A BIT OF LUNCH IN THE DINING ROOM MISSUS LATCH ALLOWED ESTHER TO HURRY ON THE DINNER
3780-177782-0018 AND BY ONE O'CLOCK THEY HAD ALL FINISHED SARAH AND MARGARET WERE GOING INTO BRIGHTON TO DO SOME SHOPPING GROVER WAS GOING TO WORTHING TO SPEND THE AFTERNOON WITH THE WIFE OF ONE OF THE GUARDS OF THE BRIGHTON AND SOUTH COAST RAILWAY
3780-177782-0019 MISSUS LATCH WENT UPSTAIRS TO LIE DOWN
3780-177782-0020 ESTHER'S SEWING FELL OUT OF HER HANDS
3780-177782-0021 AND SOON AFTER SHE PUT ON HER HAT AND STOOD THINKING REMEMBERING THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN BY THE SEA THAT SHE HAD NOT SEEN THE SEA SINCE SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL BUT SHE REMEMBERED THE TALL SHIPS THAT CAME INTO THE HARBOUR SAIL FALLING OVER SAIL
3780-177782-0022 AND THE TALL SHIPS THAT FLOATED OUT OF THE HARBOUR SAIL RISING OVER SAIL CATCHING THE BREEZE AS THEY WENT ALOFT SHE REMEMBERED THEM A SUSPENSION BRIDGE ORNAMENTED WITH STRAIGHT TAILED LIONS
3780-177782-0023 AND HAVING CROSSED SOME PIECES OF ROUGH GRASS SHE CLIMBED THE SHINGLE BANK THE HEAT RIPPLED THE BLUE AIR AND THE SEA LIKE AN EXHAUSTED CAGED BEAST LICKED THE SHINGLE SEA POPPIES BLOOMED UNDER THE WHEELS OF A DECAYING BATHING MACHINE
3780-177782-0024 AND ESTHER WONDERED BUT THE SEA HERE WAS LONELY AS A PRISON AND SEEING THE TREELESS COAST WITH ITS CHAIN OF TOWNS HER THOUGHTS SUDDENLY REVERTED TO WILLIAM SHE WISHED HE WERE WITH HER AND FOR PLEASANT CONTEMPLATION
3780-177782-0025 SHE THOUGHT OF THAT HAPPY EVENING WHEN SHE SAW HIM COMING THROUGH THE HUNTING GATE WHEN HIS ARM ABOUT HER
3780-177782-0026 THAT IF THE HORSE WON SHE WOULD TAKE SEVEN SHILLINGS OUT OF THE SWEEPSTAKES SHE KNEW NOW THAT WILLIAM DID NOT CARE ABOUT SARAH AND THAT HE CARED FOR HER HAD GIVEN A SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED MEANING TO HER EXISTENCE SHE LAY ON THE SHINGLE
3780-177782-0027 HER DAY DREAM BECOMING SOFTER AND MORE DELICATE AS IT ROUNDED INTO SUMMER SLEEP AND WHEN THE LIGHT AWOKE HER SHE SAW FLIGHTS OF WHITE CLOUDS WHITE UP ABOVE ROSE COLOURED AS THEY APPROACHED THE WEST AND WHEN SHE TURNED
3780-177782-0028 GOOD EVENING MISSUS RANDAL SAID ESTHER GLAD TO FIND SOMEONE TO SPEAK TO I'VE BEEN ASLEEP GOOD EVENING MISS YOU'RE FROM WOODVIEW I THINK YES I'M THE KITCHEN MAID
3780-177782-0029 THEY'VE GONE TO THE RACES THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO SO I CAME DOWN HERE
3780-177782-0030 BUT SHE DID NOT SPEAK SOON AFTER SHE ROSE TO HER FEET I THINK THAT IT MUST BE GETTING NEAR TEA TIME I MUST BE GOING YOU MIGHT COME IN AND HAVE A CUP OF TEA WITH ME
3780-177782-0031 IF YOU'RE NOT IN A HURRY BACK TO WOODVIEW ESTHER WAS SURPRISED AT SO MUCH CONDESCENSION AND IN SILENCE THE TWO WOMEN CROSSED THE MEADOWS
3780-177782-0032 TRAINS WERE PASSING ALL THE WHILE SCATTERING IT SEEMED IN THEIR NOISY PASSAGE OVER THE SPIDER LEGGED BRIDGE THE NEWS FROM GOODWOOD
3780-177782-0033 MISSUS RANDAL SAID AS SHE UNLOCKED THE COTTAGE DOOR IT IS ALL OVER NOW THE PEOPLE IN THOSE TRAINS KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHICH HAS WON YES I SUPPOSE THEY KNOW AND SOMEHOW I FEEL AS IF I KNEW TOO I FEEL AS IF SILVER BRAID HAD WON
3780-177782-0034 MISSUS RANDAL'S HOME WAS GAUNT AS HERSELF EVERYTHING LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN SCRAPED AND THE SPARE FURNITURE EXPRESSED A MEAGRE LONELY LIFE SHE DROPPED A PLATE AS SHE LAID THE TABLE AND STOOD PATHETICALLY LOOKING AT THE PIECES
3780-177782-0035 SHE GAVE WAY UTTERLY I HAVEN'T ONE TO GIVE YOU I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT THEY WERE GONE I SHOULD HAVE REMEMBERED AND NOT ASKED YOU TO TEA
3780-177782-0036 I CAN STIR UP MY TEA WITH ANYTHING A KNITTING NEEDLE WILL DO VERY WELL I SHOULD HAVE REMEMBERED AND NOT ASKED YOU BACK TO TEA BUT I WAS SO MISERABLE AND IT IS SO LONELY SITTING IN THIS HOUSE THAT I COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
3780-177782-0037 TALKING TO YOU SAVED ME FROM THINKING AND I DID NOT WANT TO THINK UNTIL THIS RACE WAS OVER IF SILVER BRAID IS BEATEN WE ARE RUINED INDEED I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL BECOME OF US
3780-177782-0038 FOR FIFTEEN YEARS I HAVE BORNE UP I HAVE LIVED ON LITTLE AT THE BEST OF TIMES AND VERY OFTEN HAVE GONE WITHOUT BUT THAT IS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE ANXIETY TO SEE HIM COME IN WITH A WHITE FACE
3780-177782-0039 BEATEN A HEAD ON THE POST
3780-177782-0040 OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE WON IN A CANTER I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO BE A GOOD WIFE AND TRIED TO CONSOLE HIM AND TO DO THE BEST WHEN HE SAID I HAVE LOST HALF A YEAR'S WAGES I DON'T KNOW HOW WE SHALL PULL THROUGH
3780-177782-0041 I HAVE BORNE WITH TEN THOUSAND TIMES MORE THAN I CAN TELL YOU THE SUFFERINGS OF A GAMBLER'S WIFE CANNOT BE TOLD TELL ME WHAT DO YOU THINK MY FEELINGS MUST HAVE BEEN WHEN ONE NIGHT I HEARD HIM CALLING ME OUT OF MY SLEEP
3780-177782-0042 I CAN'T DIE ANNIE WITHOUT BIDDING YOU GOOD BYE
3780-177782-0043 AND I KNOW THAT THE GAFFER WILL DO ALL HE CAN FOR YOU BUT HE HAS BEEN HIT AWFUL HARD TOO YOU MUSTN'T THINK TOO BADLY OF ME ANNIE BUT I HAVE HAD SUCH A BAD TIME THAT I COULDN'T PUT UP WITH IT ANY LONGER
3780-177782-0044 AND I THOUGHT THE BEST THING I COULD DO WOULD BE TO GO
3780-177782-0045 THERE WAS NO TIME TO SEND FOR THE DOCTOR SO I JUMPED OUT OF BED PUT THE KETTLE ON AND MADE HIM DRINK GLASS AFTER GLASS OF SALT AND WATER AT LAST HE BROUGHT UP THE LAUDANUM
3780-177782-0046 ESTHER LISTENED TO THE MELANCHOLY WOMAN AND REMEMBERED THE LITTLE MAN WHOM SHE SAW EVERY DAY SO ORDERLY SO PRECISE SO SEDATE SO METHODICAL SO UNEMOTIONAL INTO WHOSE LIFE SHE THOUGHT
3780-177782-0047 NO FAINTEST EMOTION HAD EVER ENTERED AND THIS WAS THE TRUTH SO LONG AS I ONLY HAD MYSELF TO THINK OF I DIDN'T MIND BUT NOW THERE ARE THE CHILDREN GROWING UP HE SHOULD THINK OF THEM
3780-177782-0048 HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS WHAT WILL BECOME OF THEM JOHN IS AS KIND A HUSBAND AS EVER WAS IF IT WEREN'T FOR THAT ONE FAULT BUT HE CANNOT RESIST HAVING SOMETHING ON ANY MORE THAN A DRUNKARD CAN RESIST THE BAR ROOM
3780-177782-0049 THE WOMEN STARTED TO THEIR FEET WHEN THEY GOT INTO THE STREET THE BOY WAS FAR AWAY BESIDES NEITHER HAD A PENNY TO PAY FOR THE PAPER
3780-177782-0050 SO NERVOUS WERE THEY AT LAST ESTHER PROPOSED TO ASK AT THE RED LION WHO HAD WON MISSUS RANDAL BEGGED HER TO REFRAIN URGING THAT SHE WAS UNABLE TO BEAR THE TIDINGS SHOULD IT BE EVIL
3780-177782-0051 SILVER BRAID THE BARMAN ANSWERED THE GIRL RUSHED THROUGH THE DOORS IT IS ALL RIGHT IT IS ALL RIGHT HE HAS WON SOON AFTER THE LITTLE CHILDREN IN THE LANE WERE CALLING FORTH SILVER BRAID WON
3780-177782-0052 AND OVERCOME BY THE EXCITEMENT ESTHER WALKED ALONG THE SEA ROAD TO MEET THE DRAG SHE WALKED ON AND ON UNTIL THE SOUND OF THE HORN CAME THROUGH THE CRIMSON EVENING
