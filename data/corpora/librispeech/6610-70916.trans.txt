6610-70916-0000 THE LITTLE HOUSE WAS WAITING AS IT HAD WAITED FOR MANY YEARS
6610-70916-0001 IT LEANED TOWARD THE SHELTERING HILLSIDE AS THOUGH TO GATHER FROM THE KINDLY EARTH SOME SUPPORT AND COMFORT FOR OLD AGE FIVE AND TWENTY WINTERS HAD BROKEN ITS SPIRIT
6610-70916-0002 SUMMERS CAME AND WENT BUT ONLY A FEW STRAGGLING BLOOMS MADE THEIR WAY ABOVE THE MASS OF WEEDS IN EARLY AUTUMN THISTLES AND MILKWEED TOOK POSSESSION OF THE PLACE THE MOURNFUL PURPLE OF THEIR FLOWERING
6610-70916-0003 AND AT NIGHT WHEN THE AUTUMN MOON SHONE DIMLY
6610-70916-0004 CONVOYED THEM ABOUT THE GARDEN BUT THEY NEVER WENT BEYOND IT EACH YEAR THE PANOPLY OF PURPLE SPREAD FARTHER MORE SURELY HIDING THE BRAVE BLOOMS BENEATH FAR DOWN THE PATH BESIDE THE BROKEN GATE
6610-70916-0005 ACROSS FROM IT AND QUITE HIDING THE RUIN OF THE GATE WAS A ROSE BUSH WHICH EVERY JUNE PUT FORTH ONE PERFECT WHITE ROSE LOVE HAD COME THROUGH THE GATE AND LOVE HAD GONE OUT AGAIN BUT THIS ONE FLOWER WAS LEFT BEHIND
6610-70916-0006 BRAMBLES GREW ABOUT THE DOORSTEP AND THE HINGES OF THE DOOR WERE DEEP IN RUST
6610-70916-0007 A BEACON TO THE WAYFARER OR A MESSAGE OF CHEER TO THE DISHEARTENED SINCE THE LITTLE HOUSE WAS ALONE THE SECRET SPINNERS HAD HUNG A DRAPERY OF COBWEBS BEFORE THE DESOLATE WINDOWS AS THOUGH TO VEIL THE LONELINESS FROM PASSERS BY
6610-70916-0008 NO FIRE WARMED THE SOLITARY HEARTH NO GAY AND CARELESS LAUGHTER BETRAYED THE SLEEPING ECHOES INTO ANSWER WITHIN THE HOUSE WERE ONLY DREAMS
6610-70916-0009 AND A LOW ROCKER FACING IT WAS SWERVED SHARPLY ASIDE THE EVIDENCE OF DAILY OCCUPATION SUDDENLY INTERRUPTED WAS ALL THERE A QUIET CONTENT OVERLAID BY A DUMB CREEPING PARALYSIS
6610-70916-0010 THE MARCH WIND BLEW FIERCELY THROUGH THE NIGHT AND THE LITTLE HOUSE LEANED YET MORE TOWARD THE SHELTERING HILL AFAR IN THE VILLAGE
6610-70916-0011 THE MIDNIGHT TRAIN FROM THE CITY BY WHICH THE PEOPLE OF RUSHTON REGULATED THEIR WATCHES AND CLOCKS STRANGELY ENOUGH IT STOPPED AND MORE THAN ONE GOOD MAN TURNING UNEASILY UPON HIS PILLOW WONDERED IF THE WORLD MIGHT HAVE COME TO ITS END
6610-70916-0012 HALF AN HOUR AFTERWARD A LONE FIGURE ASCENDED THE STEEP ROAD WHICH LED TO THE HOUSE A WOMAN FEARLESS OF THE NIGHT BECAUSE LIFE HAD ALREADY DONE ITS WORST TO HER
6610-70916-0013 THE MOON SHONE FITFULLY AMONG THE FLYING CLOUDS AND SHE GUIDED HERSELF BY ITS UNCERTAIN GLEAMS PAUSING NOW AND THEN IN COMPLETE DARKNESS TO WAIT FOR MORE LIGHT GHOST LIKE A LONG WHITE CHIFFON VEIL TRAILED BEHIND HER
6610-70916-0014 EVEN IN THE NIGHT SHE WATCHED FURTIVELY AND LISTENED FOR APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS ONE HAND HOLDING THE END OF HER VEIL IN SUCH A WAY THAT SHE MIGHT QUICKLY HIDE HER FACE OUTSIDE THE GATE SHE PAUSED IRRESOLUTE
6610-70916-0015 AT THE LAST MOMENT IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD NEVER ENTER THE HOUSE AGAIN A LIGHT SNOW HAD FALLEN UPON THE DEAD GARDEN COVERING ITS SCARRED FACE WITH WHITE MISS EVELINA NOTED QUICKLY THAT HER GARDEN TOO
6610-70916-0016 WAS HIDDEN AS BY CHIFFON A GUST OF WIND MADE HER SHIVER OR WAS IT THE VEILED GARDEN NERVING HERSELF TO HER NECESSITY SHE TOOK UP HER SATCHEL AND WENT UP THE PATH AS ONE MIGHT WALK WITH BARED FEET UP A LADDER OF SWORDS
6610-70916-0017 EACH STEP THAT TOOK HER NEARER THE HOUSE HURT HER THE MORE
6610-70916-0018 HER HEART SURGED PAINFULLY AS SHE ENTERED THE MUSTY DARKNESS IT WAS SO THAT MISS EVELINA CAME HOME AFTER FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS THE THOUSAND NOISES OF AN EMPTY HOUSE GREETED HER DISCORDANTLY
6610-70916-0019 A RATTLING WINDOW WAS ANSWERED BY A CREAKING STAIR A RAFTER GROANED DISMALLY AND THE SCURRYING FEET OF MICE PATTERED ACROSS A DISTANT FLOOR FUMBLING IN HER SATCHEL MISS EVELINA DREW OUT A CANDLE AND A BOX OF MATCHES
6610-70916-0020 PRESENTLY THERE WAS LIGHT IN THE LITTLE HOUSE A FAINT GLIMMERING LIGHT WHICH FLICKERED WHEN THE WIND SHOOK THE WALLS AND TWINKLED AGAIN BRAVELY WHEN IT CEASED SHE TOOK OFF HER WRAPS
6610-70916-0021 AND THROUGH FORCE OF HABIT PINNED THE MULTITUDINOUS FOLDS OF HER VEIL TO HER HAIR FORGETTING THAT AT MIDNIGHT AND IN HER OWN HOUSE THERE WERE NONE TO SEE HER FACE THEN SHE MADE A FIRE FOR THE BODY MUST BE WARMED
6610-70916-0022 THOUGH THE HEART IS DEAD AND THE SOUL STRICKEN DUMB SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER A BOX CONTAINING A SMALL CANISTER OF TEA AND SHE SOON HAD READY A CUP OF IT SO STRONG THAT IT WAS BITTER WITH HER FEET UPON THE HEARTH
6610-70916-0023 AND THE SINGLE CANDLE FLICKERING UPON THE MANTEL SHELF SHE SAT IN THE LONELY HOUSE AND SIPPED HER TEA HER WELL WORN BLACK GOWN CLUNG CLOSELY TO HER FIGURE AND THE WHITE CHIFFON VEIL THROWN BACK DID NOT WHOLLY HIDE HER ABUNDANT HAIR
6610-70916-0024 I HAVE COME BACK SHE THOUGHT I HAVE COME BACK THROUGH THAT DOOR I WENT OUT OF IT LAUGHING AT TWENTY AT FORTY FIVE I HAVE COME BACK HEART BROKEN AND I HAVE LIVED WHY DID I NOT DIE
6610-70916-0025 SHE QUESTIONED FOR THE THOUSANDTH TIME IF THERE HAD BEEN A GOD IN HEAVEN SURELY I MUST HAVE DIED THE FLAMES LEAPED MERRILY IN THE FIREPLACE AND THE DISCORDANT NOISES OF THE HOUSE RESOLVED THEMSELVES INTO VAGUE HARMONY A CRICKET
6610-70916-0026 THERE HAD NEVER BEEN ANYTHING BUT HAPPINESS IN THE HOUSE THE MISERY HAD BEEN OUTSIDE PEACE AND QUIET CONTENT HAD DWELT THERE SECURELY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT BROUGHT NO BALM NOW AS THOUGH IT WERE YESTERDAY THE BLACK WALNUT CHAIR
6610-70916-0027 HER OWN EMBROIDERY HAD APPARENTLY BUT JUST FALLEN FROM THE CHAIR AND THE DREAM THAT HAD LED TO ITS FASHIONING WAS ONLY A DREAM FROM WHICH SHE AWOKE TO ENDURING AGONY WITH SWIFT HATRED SHE TURNED HER BACK UPON THE EMBROIDERY FRAME
6610-70916-0028 TIME AS TIME HAD CEASED TO EXIST FOR HER SHE SUFFERED UNTIL SUFFERING BROUGHT ITS OWN FAR ANODYNE THE INABILITY TO SUSTAIN IT FURTHER THEN SHE SLEPT FROM SHEER WEARINESS BEFORE DAWN USUALLY SHE AWOKE
6610-70916-0029 SUFFICIENTLY RESTED TO SUFFER AGAIN WHEN SHE FELT FAINT SHE ATE SCARCELY KNOWING WHAT SHE ATE FOR FOOD WAS AS DUST AND ASHES IN HER MOUTH IN THE BAG THAT HUNG FROM HER BELT WAS A VIAL OF LAUDANUM
6610-70916-0030 RENEWED FROM TIME TO TIME AS SHE FEARED ITS STRENGTH WAS WANING SHE HAD BEEN TAUGHT THAT IT WAS WICKED TO TAKE ONE'S OWN LIFE AND THAT GOD WAS ALWAYS KIND NOT HAVING EXPERIENCED THE KINDNESS SHE BEGAN TO DOUBT THE EXISTENCE OF GOD
6610-70916-0031 AND WAS IMMEDIATELY FACE TO FACE WITH THE IDEA THAT IT COULD NOT BE WRONG TO DIE IF ONE WAS TOO MISERABLE TO LIVE HER MIND REVOLVED PERPETUALLY IN THIS CIRCLE AND CAME CONTINUALLY BACK TO A COMPROMISE SHE WOULD LIVE ONE MORE DAY
6610-70916-0032 THERE WAS ALWAYS A TO MORROW WHEN SHE SHOULD BE FREE BUT IT NEVER CAME THE FIRE DIED DOWN AND THE CANDLE HAD BUT A FEW MINUTES MORE TO BURN IT WAS THE HOUR OF THE NIGHT WHEN LIFE IS AT ITS LOWEST
6610-70916-0033 WHEN SOULS PASS OUT INTO THE GREAT BEYOND MISS EVELINA TOOK THE VIAL FROM HER RETICULE AND UNCORKED IT THE BITTER PUNGENT ODOUR CAME AS SWEET INCENSE TO HER NOSTRILS NO ONE KNEW SHE HAD COME
6610-70916-0034 SHE DREW A LONG BREATH OF THE BITTERNESS THE SILKEN LEAVES OF THE POPPIES FLOWERS OF SLEEP HAD BEEN CRUSHED INTO THIS THE LEES MUST BE DRAINED FROM THE CUP OF LIFE BEFORE THE CUP COULD BE SET ASIDE
6610-70916-0035 EVERY ONE CAME TO THIS SOONER OR LATER WHY NOT CHOOSE WHY NOT DRAIN THE CUP NOW WHEN IT HAD ALL BEEN BITTER WHY HESITATE TO DRINK THE LEES THE MONSTROUS AND INCREDIBLE PASSION OF THE RACE WAS SLOWLY CREEPING UPON HER
6610-70916-0036 HER EYES GLEAMED AND HER CHEEKS BURNED THE HUNGER FOR DEATH AT HER OWN HANDS AND ON HER OWN TERMS POSSESSED HER FRAIL BODY TO THE FULL IF THERE HAD BEEN A GOD IN HEAVEN SHE SAID ALOUD SURELY I MUST HAVE DIED THE WORDS STARTLED HER
6610-70916-0037 AND HER HAND SHOOK SO THAT SOME OF THE LAUDANUM WAS SPILLED IT WAS LONG SINCE SHE HAD HEARD HER OWN VOICE IN MORE THAN A MONOSYLLABIC ANSWER TO SOME NECESSARY QUESTION INSCRUTABLY VEILED IN MANY FOLDS OF CHIFFON
6610-70916-0038 SHE HELD HERSELF APART FROM THE WORLD AND THE WORLD CARELESSLY KIND HAD LEFT HER WHOLLY TO HERSELF SLOWLY SHE PUT THE CORK TIGHTLY INTO THE VIAL AND SLIPPED IT BACK INTO HER BAG TOMORROW SHE SIGHED
6610-70916-0039 THE FIRE FLICKERED AND WITHOUT WARNING THE CANDLE WENT OUT IN A GUST OF WIND WHICH SHOOK THE HOUSE TO ITS FOUNDATIONS STRAY CURRENTS OF AIR HAD COME THROUGH THE CREVICES OF THE RATTLING WINDOWS AND KEPT UP AN IMPERFECT VENTILATION
6610-70916-0040 SHE TOOK ANOTHER CANDLE FROM HER SATCHEL PUT IT INTO A CANDLESTICK OF BLACKENED BRASS AND SLOWLY ASCENDED THE STAIRS SHE WENT TO HER OWN ROOM THOUGH HER FEET FAILED HER AT THE THRESHOLD
6610-70916-0041 AND SHE SANK HELPLESSLY TO THE FLOOR TOO WEAK TO STAND SHE MADE HER WAY ON HER KNEES TO HER BED LEAVING THE CANDLE IN THE HALL JUST OUTSIDE HER DOOR AS SHE HAD SUSPECTED IT WAS HARDEST OF ALL TO ENTER THIS ROOM
6610-70916-0042 MUTE REMINDERS OF A LOST JOY MOCKED HER FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM SHE KNELT THERE UNTIL SOME MEASURE OF STRENGTH CAME BACK TO HER AND WITH IT A MAD FANCY TO NIGHT SHE SAID TO HERSELF I WILL BE BRAVE
6610-70916-0043 FOR ONCE I WILL PLAY A PART SINCE TO MORROW I SHALL BE FREE TO NIGHT IT SHALL BE AS THOUGH NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
6610-70916-0044 AND NOT TO TO DEATH SHE LAUGHED WILDLY
6610-70916-0045 THE SOUND DYING AT LAST INTO A SILENCE LIKE THAT OF THE TOMB SHE BROUGHT IN THE CANDLE TOOK THE DIMITY GOWN FROM THE BED AND SHOOK IT TO REMOVE THE DUST IN HER HANDS IT FELL APART BROKEN BECAUSE IT WAS TOO FRAIL TO TEAR
6610-70916-0046 SHE LAID IT ON A CHAIR FOLDING IT CAREFULLY THEN TOOK THE DUSTY BEDDING FROM HER BED AND CARRIED IT INTO THE HALL DUST AND ALL IN AN OAKEN CHEST IN A CORNER OF HER ROOM WAS HER STORE OF LINEN
6610-70916-0047 HEMMED EXQUISITELY AND EMBROIDERED WITH THE INITIALS E G SHE BEGAN TO MOVE ABOUT FEVERISHLY FEARING THAT HER RESOLUTION MIGHT FAIL THE KEY OF THE CHEST WAS IN A DRAWER IN HER DRESSER
6610-70916-0048 HER HANDS SO LONG NERVELESS WERE ALIVE AND SENTIENT NOW WHEN SHE OPENED THE CHEST THE SCENT OF LAVENDER AND ROSEMARY LONG SINCE DEAD STRUCK HER LIKE A BLOW THE ROOM SWAM BEFORE HER
6610-70916-0049 YET MISS EVELINA DRAGGED FORTH HER LINEN SHEETS AND PILLOW SLIPS MUSTY BUT CLEAN AND MADE HER BED ONCE OR TWICE HER VEIL SLIPPED DOWN OVER HER FACE
6610-70916-0050 THE CANDLE BURNING LOW WARNED HER THAT SHE MUST MAKE HASTE IN ONE OF THE SMALLER DRAWERS OF HER DRESSER WAS A NIGHTGOWN OF SHEEREST LINEN WONDERFULLY STITCHED BY HER OWN HANDS SHE HESITATED A MOMENT THEN OPENED THE DRAWER
6610-70916-0051 IT WAS YELLOWED AND MUSTY AND AS FRAIL AS A BIT OF FINE LACE BUT IT DID NOT TEAR IN HER HANDS I WILL WEAR IT SHE THOUGHT GRIMLY AS I PLANNED TO DO LONG AGO AT LAST SHE STOOD BEFORE HER MIRROR
6610-70916-0052 THE IVORY TINTED LACE FALLING AWAY FROM HER NECK AND SHOULDERS HER NECK WAS WHITE AND FIRM BUT HER RIGHT SHOULDER WAS DEEPLY HIDEOUSLY SCARRED BURNED BODY AND BURNED SOUL SHE MUTTERED AND THIS MY WEDDING NIGHT
6610-70916-0053 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE SHE PITIED HERSELF NOT KNOWING THAT SELF PITY IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD RELIEF FROM OVERPOWERING SORROW WHEN DETACHMENT IS POSSIBLE THE LONG SLOW HEALING HAS FAINTLY BUT SURELY BEGUN
6610-70916-0054 SHE UNPINNED HER VEIL TOOK DOWN HER HEAVY WHITE HAIR AND BRAIDED IT THERE WAS NO GLEAM OF SILVER EVEN IN THE LIGHT IT WAS AS LUSTRELESS AS A FIELD OF SNOW UPON A DARK DAY
6610-70916-0055 THAT DONE SHE STOOD THERE STARING AT HERSELF IN THE MIRROR AND LIVING OVER REMORSELESSLY THE ONE DAY THAT LIKE A LIGHTNING STROKE HAD BLASTED HER LIFE HER VEIL SLIPPED UNHEEDED FROM HER DRESSER TO THE FLOOR
6610-70916-0056 LEANING FORWARD SHE STUDIED HER FACE THAT SHE HAD ONCE LOVED THEN SWIFTLY LEARNED TO HATE EVEN ON THE STREET CLOSELY VEILED SHE WOULD NOT LOOK AT A SHOP WINDOW LEST SHE MIGHT SEE HERSELF REFLECTED IN THE PLATE GLASS
6610-70916-0057 AND SHE HAD KEPT THE MIRROR IN HER ROOM COVERED WITH A CLOTH SINCE THE DAY SHE LEFT THE HOSPITAL
6610-70916-0058 NO HUMAN BEING SAVE HERSELF HAD SEEN HER FACE SHE HAD PRAYED FOR DEATH BUT HAD NOT BEEN MORE THAN SLIGHTLY ILL UPBORNE AS SHE WAS
