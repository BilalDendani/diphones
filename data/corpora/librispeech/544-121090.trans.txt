544-121090-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTY TWO MADAME DE SAINT MERAN
544-121090-0001 WHITHER ALL THE ENTREATIES OF MADAME DE VILLEFORT HAD FAILED IN PERSUADING HIM TO ACCOMPANY THEM THE PROCUREUR HAD SHUT HIMSELF UP IN HIS STUDY ACCORDING TO HIS CUSTOM WITH A HEAP OF PAPERS CALCULATED TO ALARM ANY ONE ELSE
544-121090-0002 BUT WHICH GENERALLY SCARCELY SATISFIED HIS INORDINATE DESIRES BUT THIS TIME THE PAPERS WERE A MERE MATTER OF FORM VILLEFORT HAD SECLUDED HIMSELF NOT TO STUDY
544-121090-0003 AND WITH THE DOOR LOCKED AND ORDERS GIVEN THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE DISTURBED EXCEPTING FOR IMPORTANT BUSINESS HE SAT DOWN IN HIS ARM CHAIR AND BEGAN TO PONDER OVER THE EVENTS THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHICH HAD DURING THE LAST EIGHT DAYS
544-121090-0004 FILLED HIS MIND WITH SO MANY GLOOMY THOUGHTS AND BITTER RECOLLECTIONS THEN INSTEAD OF PLUNGING INTO THE MASS OF DOCUMENTS PILED BEFORE HIM HE OPENED THE DRAWER OF HIS DESK TOUCHED A SPRING AND DREW OUT A PARCEL OF CHERISHED MEMORANDA
544-121090-0005 AMONGST WHICH HE HAD CAREFULLY ARRANGED IN CHARACTERS ONLY KNOWN TO HIMSELF THE NAMES OF ALL THOSE WHO EITHER IN HIS POLITICAL CAREER IN MONEY MATTERS AT THE BAR OR IN HIS MYSTERIOUS LOVE AFFAIRS HAD BECOME HIS ENEMIES
544-121090-0006 THEIR NUMBER WAS FORMIDABLE NOW THAT HE HAD BEGUN TO FEAR AND YET THESE NAMES POWERFUL THOUGH THEY WERE HAD OFTEN CAUSED HIM TO SMILE WITH THE SAME KIND OF SATISFACTION EXPERIENCED BY A TRAVELLER WHO
544-121090-0007 FROM THE SUMMIT OF A MOUNTAIN BEHOLDS AT HIS FEET THE CRAGGY EMINENCES THE ALMOST IMPASSABLE PATHS AND THE FEARFUL CHASMS THROUGH WHICH HE HAS SO PERILOUSLY CLIMBED
544-121090-0008 WHEN HE HAD RUN OVER ALL THESE NAMES IN HIS MEMORY AGAIN READ AND STUDIED THEM COMMENTING MEANWHILE UPON HIS LISTS HE SHOOK HIS HEAD NO HE MURMURED
544-121090-0009 NONE OF MY ENEMIES WOULD HAVE WAITED SO PATIENTLY AND LABORIOUSLY FOR SO LONG A SPACE OF TIME THAT THEY MIGHT NOW COME AND CRUSH ME WITH THIS SECRET SOMETIMES AS HAMLET SAYS FOUL DEEDS WILL RISE
544-121090-0010 BUT LIKE A PHOSPHORIC LIGHT THEY RISE BUT TO MISLEAD THE STORY HAS BEEN TOLD BY THE CORSICAN TO SOME PRIEST WHO IN HIS TURN HAS REPEATED IT
544-121090-0011 MAY HAVE HEARD IT AND TO ENLIGHTEN HIMSELF BUT WHY SHOULD HE WISH TO ENLIGHTEN HIMSELF UPON THE SUBJECT ASKED VILLEFORT AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
544-121090-0012 SON OF A SHIPOWNER OF MALTA DISCOVERER OF A MINE IN THESSALY NOW VISITING PARIS FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT INTEREST I SAY CAN HE TAKE IN DISCOVERING A GLOOMY MYSTERIOUS AND USELESS FACT LIKE THIS HOWEVER
544-121090-0013 AMONG ALL THE INCOHERENT DETAILS GIVEN TO ME BY THE ABBE BUSONI AND BY LORD WILMORE BY THAT FRIEND AND THAT ENEMY ONE THING APPEARS CERTAIN AND CLEAR IN MY OPINION THAT IN NO PERIOD IN NO CASE IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE
544-121090-0014 COULD THERE HAVE BEEN ANY CONTACT BETWEEN HIM AND ME BUT VILLEFORT UTTERED WORDS WHICH EVEN HE HIMSELF DID NOT BELIEVE HE DREADED NOT SO MUCH THE REVELATION FOR HE COULD REPLY TO OR DENY ITS TRUTH
544-121090-0015 WHICH APPEARED SUDDENLY IN LETTERS OF BLOOD UPON THE WALL BUT WHAT HE WAS REALLY ANXIOUS FOR WAS TO DISCOVER WHOSE HAND HAD TRACED THEM WHILE HE WAS ENDEAVORING TO CALM HIS FEARS
544-121090-0016 AND INSTEAD OF DWELLING UPON THE POLITICAL FUTURE THAT HAD SO OFTEN BEEN THE SUBJECT OF HIS AMBITIOUS DREAMS WAS IMAGINING A FUTURE LIMITED TO THE ENJOYMENTS OF HOME IN FEAR OF AWAKENING THE ENEMY THAT HAD SO LONG SLEPT
544-121090-0017 THE NOISE OF A CARRIAGE SOUNDED IN THE YARD THEN HE HEARD THE STEPS OF AN AGED PERSON ASCENDING THE STAIRS FOLLOWED BY TEARS AND LAMENTATIONS SUCH AS SERVANTS ALWAYS GIVE VENT TO
544-121090-0018 WHEN THEY WISH TO APPEAR INTERESTED IN THEIR MASTER'S GRIEF HE DREW BACK THE BOLT OF HIS DOOR AND ALMOST DIRECTLY AN OLD LADY ENTERED UNANNOUNCED CARRYING HER SHAWL ON HER ARM AND HER BONNET IN HER HAND
544-121090-0019 THE WHITE HAIR WAS THROWN BACK FROM HER YELLOW FOREHEAD AND HER EYES ALREADY SUNKEN BY THE FURROWS OF AGE NOW ALMOST DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE EYELIDS SWOLLEN WITH GRIEF OH SIR SHE SAID OH SIR
544-121090-0020 WHAT A MISFORTUNE I SHALL DIE OF IT OH YES I SHALL CERTAINLY DIE OF IT AND THEN FALLING UPON THE CHAIR NEAREST THE DOOR SHE BURST INTO A PAROXYSM OF SOBS THE SERVANTS
544-121090-0021 STANDING IN THE DOORWAY NOT DARING TO APPROACH NEARER WERE LOOKING AT NOIRTIER'S OLD SERVANT WHO HAD HEARD THE NOISE FROM HIS MASTER'S ROOM AND RUN THERE ALSO REMAINING BEHIND THE OTHERS VILLEFORT ROSE
544-121090-0022 AND RAN TOWARDS HIS MOTHER IN LAW FOR IT WAS SHE WHY WHAT CAN HAVE HAPPENED HE EXCLAIMED WHAT HAS THUS DISTURBED YOU
544-121090-0023 IS DEAD ANSWERED THE OLD MARCHIONESS
544-121090-0024 SHE APPEARED TO BE STUPEFIED VILLEFORT DREW BACK AND CLASPING HIS HANDS TOGETHER EXCLAIMED DEAD SO SUDDENLY A WEEK AGO CONTINUED MADAME DE SAINT MERAN
544-121090-0025 WE WENT OUT TOGETHER IN THE CARRIAGE AFTER DINNER
544-121090-0026 HAD BEEN UNWELL FOR SOME DAYS STILL THE IDEA OF SEEING OUR DEAR VALENTINE AGAIN INSPIRED HIM WITH COURAGE AND NOTWITHSTANDING HIS ILLNESS HE WOULD LEAVE AT SIX LEAGUES FROM MARSEILLES
544-121090-0027 AFTER HAVING EATEN SOME OF THE LOZENGES HE IS ACCUSTOMED TO TAKE HE FELL INTO SUCH A DEEP SLEEP THAT IT APPEARED TO ME UNNATURAL STILL I HESITATED TO WAKE HIM ALTHOUGH I FANCIED THAT HIS FACE WAS FLUSHED
544-121090-0028 AND THAT THE VEINS OF HIS TEMPLES THROBBED MORE VIOLENTLY THAN USUAL HOWEVER AS IT BECAME DARK AND I COULD NO LONGER SEE I FELL ASLEEP I WAS SOON AROUSED BY A PIERCING SHRIEK
544-121090-0029 AS FROM A PERSON SUFFERING IN HIS DREAMS AND HE SUDDENLY THREW HIS HEAD BACK VIOLENTLY I CALLED THE VALET I STOPPED THE POSTILION
544-121090-0030 I APPLIED MY SMELLING SALTS BUT ALL WAS OVER AND I ARRIVED AT AIX BY THE SIDE OF A CORPSE VILLEFORT STOOD WITH HIS MOUTH HALF OPEN QUITE STUPEFIED OF COURSE YOU SENT FOR A DOCTOR
544-121090-0031 IMMEDIATELY BUT AS I HAVE TOLD YOU IT WAS TOO LATE YES BUT THEN HE COULD TELL
544-121090-0032 OH YES SIR HE TOLD ME
544-121090-0033 AND WHAT DID YOU DO THEN
544-121090-0034 HAD ALWAYS EXPRESSED A DESIRE IN CASE HIS DEATH HAPPENED DURING HIS ABSENCE FROM PARIS THAT HIS BODY MIGHT BE BROUGHT TO THE FAMILY VAULT I HAD HIM PUT INTO A LEADEN COFFIN
544-121090-0035 OH MY POOR MOTHER SAID VILLEFORT TO HAVE SUCH DUTIES TO PERFORM AT YOUR AGE AFTER SUCH A BLOW GOD HAS SUPPORTED ME THROUGH ALL AND THEN
544-121090-0036 HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING FOR ME THAT I PERFORMED FOR HIM IT IS TRUE THAT SINCE I LEFT HIM I SEEM TO HAVE LOST MY SENSES I CANNOT CRY AT MY AGE THEY SAY THAT WE HAVE NO MORE TEARS STILL
544-121090-0037 I THINK THAT WHEN ONE IS IN TROUBLE ONE SHOULD HAVE THE POWER OF WEEPING WHERE IS VALENTINE SIR IT IS ON HER ACCOUNT I AM HERE I WISH TO SEE VALENTINE
544-121090-0038 VILLEFORT THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE TO REPLY THAT VALENTINE WAS AT A BALL SO HE ONLY SAID THAT SHE HAD GONE OUT WITH HER STEP MOTHER AND THAT SHE SHOULD BE FETCHED THIS INSTANT SIR THIS INSTANT I BESEECH YOU
544-121090-0039 SAID THE OLD LADY VILLEFORT PLACED THE ARM OF MADAME DE SAINT MERAN WITHIN HIS OWN AND CONDUCTED HER TO HIS APARTMENT REST YOURSELF MOTHER HE SAID THE MARCHIONESS RAISED HER HEAD AT THIS WORD
544-121090-0040 AND BEHOLDING THE MAN WHO SO FORCIBLY REMINDED HER OF HER DEEPLY REGRETTED CHILD WHO STILL LIVED FOR HER IN VALENTINE SHE FELT TOUCHED AT THE NAME OF MOTHER AND BURSTING INTO TEARS SHE FELL ON HER KNEES BEFORE AN ARM CHAIR
544-121090-0041 WHERE SHE BURIED HER VENERABLE HEAD VILLEFORT LEFT HER TO THE CARE OF THE WOMEN WHILE OLD BARROIS RAN HALF SCARED TO HIS MASTER FOR NOTHING FRIGHTENS OLD PEOPLE SO MUCH
544-121090-0042 AS WHEN DEATH RELAXES ITS VIGILANCE OVER THEM FOR A MOMENT IN ORDER TO STRIKE SOME OTHER OLD PERSON THEN WHILE MADAME DE SAINT MERAN REMAINED ON HER KNEES PRAYING FERVENTLY
544-121090-0043 AND WENT HIMSELF TO FETCH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER FROM MADAME DE MORCERF'S HE WAS SO PALE WHEN HE APPEARED AT THE DOOR OF THE BALL ROOM THAT VALENTINE RAN TO HIM SAYING OH FATHER SOME MISFORTUNE HAS HAPPENED
