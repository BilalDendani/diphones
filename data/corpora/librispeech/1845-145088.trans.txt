1845-145088-0000 DUNDEE LAUGHED THE PARROT WHICH HAD SAVED HIS LIFE ECHOING HIS MIRTH RAUCOUSLY AS HIS EYES HIT UPON THE FOLLOWING LINES OF FINE PRINT
1845-145088-0001 OF WHO'S WHO IN AMERICA BURNS WILLIAM JOHN DETECTIVE
1845-145088-0002 BALTIMORE OCTOBER NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE A TAUNT AND A JOKE WHICH TURNED SOUR MY DEAR WATSON HE EXULTED TO THE PARROT A JOKE I WAS NOT INTENDED TO LIVE TO LAUGH OVER HE CLOSED THE BOOK AND REPLACED IT IN THE BOOKCASE
1845-145088-0003 CARELESS OF FINGERPRINTS FOR HE WAS SURE THE MURDERER HAD BEEN TOO CLEVER TO LEAVE ANY BEHIND HIM IN THAT ROOM OR UPON THE GUN AND SILENCER EITHER FOR THAT MATTER INTERESTEDLY DUNDEE SURVEYED THE SCENE OF HIS ATTEMPTED MURDER
1845-145088-0004 JUST AS THERE HAD BEEN ON DEXTER SPRAGUE'S
1845-145088-0005 ON DUNDEE'S OWN TYPEWRITER AND STATIONERY STRAWN MIGHT EVEN HAVE GOT A MOURNFUL SORT OF AMUSEMENT OUT OF THE FACT THAT DUNDEE HAD BEEN ADVISED TO CALL UPON A GREATER DETECTIVE THAN HIMSELF FOR ASSISTANCE YES INGENIOUS INDEED
1845-145088-0006 AND SO AMAZINGLY SIMPLE SUDDENLY THE YOUNG DETECTIVE SNATCHED FOR HIS HAT IF THE MURDERER WAS SO INGENIOUS IN THIS CASE MIGHT HE NOT HAVE BEEN EQUALLY CLEVER IN PLANNING AND EXECUTING THE MURDER OF NITA LEIGH SELIM
1845-145088-0007 TWENTY MINUTES LATER HE PARKED HIS CAR IN THE RUTTY ROAD BEFORE THE SELIM HOUSE IN PRIMROSE MEADOWS AND HONKED HIS HORN LOUDLY TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE PLAINCLOTHESMEN CAPTAIN STRAWN HAD DETAILED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MURDER
1845-145088-0008 WITH WHICH THE FRONT DOOR WAS EQUIPPED STRAIGHT DOWN THE MAIN HALL HE WENT AND INTO THE LITTLE FOYER BETWEEN THE HALL AND NITA'S BEDROOM HE SNATCHED UP THE TELEPHONE AND TO HIS RELIEF IT WAS NOT DEAD HE GAVE THE NUMBER OF CAPTAIN STRAWN'S HOME AND HAD THE PLEASURE OF LEARNING THAT HE HAD
1845-145088-0009 INTERRUPTED HIS FORMER CHIEF AT A LATE SUNDAY BREAKFAST WHEN DID YOU WITHDRAW THE GUARD FROM THE SELIM HOUSE HE ASKED ABRUPTLY CUTTING SHORT STRAWN'S CORDIAL WELCOME HOME LATE THURSDAY AFTERNOON THE CHIEF OF THE HOMICIDE SQUAD ANSWERED BELLIGERENTLY
1845-145088-0010 NO USE TO EXPLAIN NOW TO STRAWN THAT THE MURDERER HAD BEEN GIVEN EVERY CHANCE TO REMOVE ANY BETRAYING TRACES OF HIS CRIME BESIDES HIS FIRST EXCITED HUNCH AFTER HIS OWN ATTEMPTED MURDER MIGHT VERY WELL BE A WILD GROUNDLESS ONE
1845-145088-0011 IN HIS DUNDEE'S CASE THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE MURDER'S BEING DELAYED OR ARRANGED SO THAT THE DETECTIVE MIGHT BE SLAIN WHEN THE WHOLE CROWD WAS ASSEMBLED WAS OBVIOUS THE MURDERER HAD READ IN A LATE SATURDAY AFTERNOON EXTRA
1845-145088-0012 A COPY OF WHICH WAS NOW IN DUNDEE'S POCKET DISTRICT ATTORNEY SANDERSON'S BOAST TO THE PRESS THAT HIS OFFICE HAD BEEN WORKING ON AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THEORY THAN THAT WHICH CONNECTED THE TWO MURDERS WITH SWALLOW TAIL SAMMY
1845-145088-0013 THAT SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR DUNDEE EXPECTED BACK IN HAMILTON EARLY SUNDAY MORNING HAD BEEN INVESTIGATING NITA LEIGH'S PAST LIFE IN NEW YORK AND DESPITE DUNDEE'S TELEGRAPHED WARNING HE HAD HINTED SENSATIONAL REVELATIONS CONNECTED WITH THE TWELVE YEAR OLD
1845-145088-0014 ROYAL BLUE VELVET DRESS WHICH NITA HAD CHOSEN TO BE HER SHROUD AND IN HIS DESIRE TO REASSURE THE PUBLIC THROUGH THE PRESS SANDERSON HAD MYSTERIOUSLY PROMISED EVEN MORE SPECIFIC REVELATIONS THAN DUNDEE HAD ACTUALLY BROUGHT HOME WITH HIM
1845-145088-0015 PRODDED BY REPORTERS SANDERSON HAD ADMITTED THAT HE DID NOT HIMSELF KNOW THE NATURE OF THOSE REVELATIONS THE EXASPERATED YOUNG DETECTIVE COULD PICTURE THE MURDERER READING THOSE SENSATIONAL HINTS AND PROMISES
1845-145088-0016 THE NEED FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION SO THAT SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR DUNDEE SHOULD NOT LIVE TO TELL THE TALE OF HIS NEW YORK DISCOVERIES TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR ANYONE ELSE BUT WHETHER HE WAS RIGHT OR WRONG DUNDEE DETERMINED TO GIVE HIS HUNCH A CHANCE
1845-145088-0017 SHOT THROUGH THE BACK AS SHE SAT AT HER DRESSING TABLE POWDERING HER FACE IF HER MURDER HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY MECHANICAL MEANS HOW HAD IT BEEN DONE THERE WAS NO HOT AIR REGISTER HERE FROM THE DRESSING TABLE DUNDEE WALKED TO THE WINDOW
1845-145088-0018 UPON WHOSE PALE GREEN FRAME THERE WAS STILL THE TINY PENCIL MARK WHICH DOCTOR PRICE HAD DRAWN TO INDICATE THE END OF THE PATH ALONG WHICH THE BULLET HAD TRAVELED PROVIDED IT HAD TRAVELED SO FAR NOTHING HERE TO AID IN A MECHANICAL MURDER
1845-145088-0019 BUT IN A FLASH DUNDEE CHANGED HIS MIND FOR JUST SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE PENCIL MARK THERE WAS A SMALL DENT IN THE SOFT PAINTED PINE OF THE WINDOW FRAME AND BEFORE HIS MIND COULD FRAME WORDS AND SENTENCES
1845-145088-0020 NOTHING HERE NOT NOW BECAUSE HE HIMSELF HAD TAKEN THE LAMP TO THE COURTHOUSE FOR SAFE KEEPING HE SAW IT CLEARLY IN IMAGINATION THAT BRONZE FLOOR LAMP
1845-145088-0021 WHICH FLORA MILES HAD DESCRIBED ONE OF THE BIG GLASS JEWELS HAD BEEN MISSING LEAVING AN UNSIGHTLY HOLE
1845-145088-0022 FOR IF HIS HUNCH WAS CORRECT THE GUN WEDGED INTO THE BIG BOWL WITH THE SILENCER SLIGHTLY PROTRUDING FROM THE JEWEL HOLE HAD KICKED JUST AS IT HAD KICKED AN HOUR BEFORE WHEN IT HAD DISLODGED ITSELF FROM THE HOLE IN THE HOT AIR REGISTER
1845-145088-0023 AND CLATTERED DOWN THE BIG PIPE TO THE HEAT RESERVOIR OF THE FURNACE THAT THE BIG LAMP WHEN HE FOLLOWING STRAWN HAD FIRST EXAMINED THE SCENE OF NITA'S MURDER HAD NOT STOOD IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW FRAME DID NOT DAMPEN DUNDEE'S EXCITEMENT IN THE LEAST
1845-145088-0024 AFTER KAREN MARSHALL'S SCREAM THAT ROOM HAD BEEN FILLED WITH EXCITED PEOPLE WHO HAD RUSHED ABOUT LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW FOR THE MURDERER AND DOING ALL THE OTHER THINGS WHICH TERROR STRICKEN PEOPLE DO IN SUCH A CRISIS NO THE MURDERER OR MURDERESS
1845-145088-0025 TO THE PLACE IT HAD ALWAYS OCCUPIED BEFORE BUT HOW HAD THE GUN BEEN FIRED FROM THE LAMP ELECTRICALLY ANOTHER PICTURE FLASHED INTO DUNDEE'S MIND HE SAW HIMSELF STOOPING ON MONDAY AFTERNOON
1845-145088-0026 TO SEE IF THE PLUG OF THE LAMP'S CORD HAD BEEN PULLED FROM THE SOCKET SAW IT AGAIN AS IT WAS THEN NEARLY OUT SO THAT NO CURRENT COULD PASS FROM THE BASEBOARD OUTLET UNDER THE BOOKCASE INTO THE BRONZE LAMP
1845-145088-0027 HOW FAR FROM THE TRUTH HIS CONCLUSION THAT MONDAY HAD BEEN BUT WHAT WAS THE REAL TRUTH SUDDENLY DUNDEE FLUNG BACK THE MOSS GREEN WILTON RUG WHICH ALMOST ENTIRELY COVERED THE BEDROOM FLOOR AND REVEALED THE BELL WHICH DEXTER SPRAGUE
1845-145088-0028 HAD RIGGED UP SO THAT NITA MIGHT SUMMON LYDIA FROM HER BASEMENT ROOM IN CASE OF DIRE NEED A PRECAUTION WITH WHICH THE MURDERER WAS PROBABLY FAMILIAR SINCE LOIS DUNLAP MIGHT INNOCENTLY HAVE SPREAD THE NEWS OF ITS EXISTENCE
1845-145088-0029 THERE WAS A HALF INCH HOLE IN THE HARDWOOD FLOOR AND OUT OF IT ISSUED A LENGTH OF GREEN ELECTRIC CORD CONNECTED WITH TWO SMALL FLAT METAL PLATES ONE UPON THE OTHER SO THAT WHEN STEPPED UPON A BELL WOULD RING IN LYDIA'S BASEMENT ROOM
1845-145088-0030 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD ABOUT THE WIRE ALTHOUGH IT WAS OBVIOUSLY NEW A SECTION OF IT NEAR THE TWO METAL PLATES WAS WRAPPED WITH BLACK ADHESIVE TAPE ANOTHER MEMORY KNOCKED FOR ATTENTION UPON DUNDEE'S MIND THE LONG CORD OF THE BRONZE LAMP
1845-145088-0031 HAD BEEN MENDED WITH EXACTLY THE SAME SORT OF TAPE ABOUT A FOOT FROM WHERE IT ENDED IN THE CONTACT PLUG WITHIN ANOTHER TWO MINUTES DUNDEE WITH A FLASHLIGHT HE HAD FOUND IN THE KITCHEN WAS EXPLORING THE DARK EARTHY PORTION OF THE BASEMENT
1845-145088-0032 INTO LYDIA'S ROOM HE WAS TOO LATE THANKS TO CAPTAIN STRAWN THE BELL WHICH SPRAGUE HAD RIGGED UP WAS IN WORKING ORDER AGAIN BUT AS HE WAS PASSING OUT OF THE BASEMENT HE GLANCED AT THE CEILING OF THE LARGE ROOM DEVOTED TO FURNACE
1845-145088-0033 HOT WATER HEATER AND LAUNDRY TUBS AND IN THE CEILING HE SAW A HOLE THE MURDERER HAD LEFT A TRACE HE COULD NOT OBLITERATE AT THREE O'CLOCK THAT SUNDAY AFTERNOON BONNIE DUNDEE FATIGUED AFTER A STRENUOUS DAY
1845-145088-0034 AND SUFFERING TO HIS OWN SOMEWHAT DISGUSTED AMUSEMENT FROM REACTION EVEN A DETECTIVE FEELS SOME SHOCK AT HAVING NARROWLY ESCAPED DEATH
1845-145088-0035 PLAYING ANAGRAMS AFTER GREETING HIM MISSUS CRAIN ROSE TO SURRENDER HER PLACE TO THE VISITOR YOU PLAY WITH THIS GIRL OF MINE MISTER DUNDEE SHE'S TOO CLEVER FOR ME SHE'S BEATEN ME EVERY GAME SO FAR
1845-145088-0036 BECAUSE I WANTED TO FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW NITA SELIM WAS KILLED AND I DID DUNDEE ANSWERED I WISH I KNEW AS WELL WHO MURDERED HER MUTE BEFORE PENNY'S EXCITED QUESTIONS THE DETECTIVE IDLY SELECTED LETTERS FROM THE MASS
1845-145088-0037 OF FACE UP BLOCKS ON THE TABLE AND SPELLED OUT IN A LONG ROW THE NAMES OF ALL THE GUESTS AT NITA'S FATAL BRIDGE PARTY SUDDENLY AND WITH A CRY THAT STARTLED PENNY DUNDEE MADE A NEW NAME WITH THE LITTLE WOODEN LETTERS
