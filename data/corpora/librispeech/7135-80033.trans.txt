7135-80033-0000 HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN THAT ANY EVIL THING SPOKEN OF HER HAD BEEN SHEER SLANDER AND YET HE HAD MANAGED TO TELL HER EVERYTHING OF HIMSELF WITHOUT SUBJECTING HIMSELF TO HER UNDYING ANGER WHEN SHE LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM
7135-80033-0001 THE CONVERSATION TURNED AGAIN UPON THE GREAT POPENJOY QUESTION AND FROM CERTAIN WORDS WHICH FELL FROM THE DEAN JACK WAS ENABLED TO SURMISE THAT LORD GEORGE HAD REASON TO HOPE THAT AN HEIR MIGHT BE BORN TO HIM
7135-80033-0002 HE DOES NOT LOOK AS THOUGH HE WOULD LIVE LONG HIMSELF
7135-80033-0003 I TRUST HE MAY WITH ALL MY HEART SAID LORD GEORGE THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION REPLIED THE DEAN I ONLY SAY THAT HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT
7135-80033-0004 LORD GEORGE WENT AWAY EARLY AND JACK DE BARON THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO RETIRE AT THE SAME TIME SO YOU'RE GOING TO MORROW DEAR SAID THE DEAN YES PAPA IS IT NOT BEST OH YES
7135-80033-0005 NOTHING COULD BE WORSE THAN A PROLONGED SEPARATION HE MEANS TO BE HONEST AND GOOD HE IS HONEST AND GOOD PAPA YOU HAVE HAD YOUR TRIUMPH
7135-80033-0006 OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE TRIUMPHED HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN YOU AWAY AND YOU AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN SEPARATED OF COURSE YOU ARE BOUND TO OBEY HIM BUT THERE MUST BE LIMITS
7135-80033-0007 HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN YOU AWAY AS THOUGH IN DISGRACE AND THAT I COULD NOT STAND THERE WILL BE AN END OF THAT NOW GOD KNOWS WHEN I SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN MARY
7135-80033-0008 I DON'T THINK HE EVER GETS OVER ANY FEELING HAVING NO HOME OF HIS OWN WHY DOES HE NOT BRING YOU HERE I DON'T THINK HE LIKES THE IDEA OF BEING A BURDEN TO YOU EXACTLY HE HAS NOT CORDIALITY ENOUGH TO FEEL
7135-80033-0009 THAT WHEN TWO MEN ARE IN A BOAT TOGETHER AS HE AND I ARE BECAUSE OF YOU
7135-80033-0010 THAN YOU ARE IF IT WERE ALL WELL BETWEEN US AND HE HAD THE PROPERTY SHOULD I SCRUPLE TO GO AND STAY AT MANOR CROSS YOU WOULD STILL HAVE YOUR OWN HOUSE TO GO BACK TO SO WILL HE
7135-80033-0011 BUT IT CAN'T BE ALTERED DEAR AND GOD FORBID THAT I SHOULD SET YOU AGAINST HIM HE IS NOT A RAKE NOR A SPENDTHRIFT NOR WILL HE RUN AFTER OTHER WOMEN MARY THOUGHT OF MISSUS HOUGHTON BUT SHE HELD HER TONGUE HE IS NOT A BAD MAN
7135-80033-0012 AND I THINK HE LOVES YOU I AM SURE HE DOES BUT I CAN'T HELP FEELING SAD AT PARTING WITH YOU I SUPPOSE
7135-80033-0013 MARY WHEN SHE WAS ALONE IN HER ROOM
7135-80033-0014 A THOUSAND PITIES THAT IT SHOULD BE SO IT WAS TO BE REGRETTED MUCH REGRETTED
7135-80033-0015 SHE WAS ANGRY WITH HERSELF BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN INDISCREET AND SHE WAS STILL ANGRY A LITTLE ANGRY WITH HIM BECAUSE HE HAD YIELDED TO THE TEMPTATION BUT THERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING SWEET IN IT
7135-80033-0016 SHE WAS SORRY GRIEVED IN HER HEART OF HEARTS THAT HE SHOULD LOVE HER SHE HAD NEVER STRIVEN TO GAIN HIS LOVE
7135-80033-0017 SHE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE SHOWN HERSELF TO BE SO PLEASED WITH HIS SOCIETY BUT YET YET IT WAS SWEET THEN THERE CAME UPON HER SOME MEMORY OF HER OLD DREAMS
7135-80033-0018 BEFORE SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED TO LORD GEORGE SHE KNEW HOW VAIN HAD BEEN THOSE DREAMS
7135-80033-0019 BUT YET SHE REMEMBERED THEM AND FELT AS THOUGH THEY HAD COME TRUE WITH A DREAMY HALF TRUTH AND SHE BROUGHT TO MIND ALL THOSE FLATTERING WORDS WITH WHICH HE HAD SPOKEN HER PRAISES
7135-80033-0020 HOW HE HAD TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS AN ANGEL TOO GOOD AND PURE TO BE SUPPOSED CAPABLE OF EVIL HOW HE HAD SAID THAT IN HIS CASTLES IN THE AIR HE WOULD STILL THINK OF HER AS HIS WIFE
7135-80033-0021 SURELY A MAN MAY BUILD WHAT CASTLES IN THE AIR HE PLEASES IF HE WILL ONLY HOLD HIS TONGUE SHE WAS QUITE SURE THAT SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM BUT SHE WAS SURE ALSO THAT HIS WAS THE PROPER WAY OF MAKING LOVE
7135-80033-0022 AND THEN SHE THOUGHT OF GUSS MILDMAY COULD SHE NOT IN PURE CHARITY DO A GOOD TURN TO THAT POOR GIRL MIGHT SHE NOT TELL CAPTAIN DE BARON THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO MARRY HER AND IF HE FELT IT TO BE HIS DUTY
7135-80033-0023 WOULD HE NOT DO SO IT MAY BE DOUBTED WHETHER IN THESE MOMENTS SHE DID NOT THINK MUCH BETTER OF CAPTAIN DE BARON THAN THAT GENTLEMAN DESERVED ON THE NEXT DAY THE MANOR CROSS CARRIAGE CAME OVER FOR HER
7135-80033-0024 THE FAMILY CARRIAGE SHOULD BRING HER HOME BUT IT CAME EMPTY GOD BLESS YOU DEAREST SAID THE DEAN AS HE PUT HER INTO THE VEHICLE GOOD BYE PAPA I SUPPOSE YOU CAN COME OVER AND SEE ME
7135-80033-0025 I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN I SAW NONE OF THE LADIES WHEN I WAS THERE YESTERDAY I DON'T CARE A BIT FOR THE LADIES WHERE I GO PAPA
7135-80033-0026 THE DEAN SMILED AND KISSED HER AGAIN AND THEN SHE WAS GONE SHE HARDLY KNEW WHAT GRAND THINGS WERE IN STORE FOR HER SHE WAS STILL REBELLING IN HER HEART AGAINST SKIRTS AND PETTICOATS AND RESOLVING THAT SHE WOULD NOT GO TO CHURCH TWICE ON SUNDAYS UNLESS SHE LIKED IT
7135-80033-0027 WHEN THE CARRIAGE DROVE UP TO THE DOOR
7135-80033-0028 BECAUSE WE DIDN'T LIKE TO FILL THE CARRIAGE AND GEORGE WANTED US TO SEND IT EARLY SAID LADY SARAH BEFORE WE HAD DONE OUR WORK THEY ALL KISSED HER AFFECTIONATELY AND THEN SHE WAS AGAIN IN HER HUSBAND'S ARMS
7135-80033-0029 MISSUS TOFF CURTSEYED TO HER MOST RESPECTFULLY
7135-80033-0030 EVEN THE TALL FOOTMAN IN KNEE BREECHES STOOD BACK WITH A DEMEANOUR WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN VOUCHSAFED ONLY TO THE REAL LADIES OF THE FAMILY WHO COULD TELL HOW SOON THAT
7135-80033-0031 AND THEN THEN HOW GREAT WOULD NOT BE THE GLORY OF THE DEAN'S DAUGHTER
7135-80033-0032 MARY'S HAT WAS IMMEDIATELY OFF AND SHE DECLARED HERSELF READY TO GO TO THE MARCHIONESS MAMMA HAS HAD A GREAT DEAL TO TROUBLE HER SINCE YOU WERE HERE SAID LADY SUSANNA AS SHE LED THE WAY UPSTAIRS SHE HAS AGED VERY MUCH
7135-80033-0033 SHE THINKS SO MUCH OF THINGS NOW AND THEN SHE CRIES SO OFTEN WE DO ALL WE CAN TO PREVENT HER FROM CRYING BECAUSE IT DOES MAKE HER SO WEAK BEEF TEA IS BEST WE THINK
7135-80033-0034 BROUGHT THE FOOTSTOOL NOW SIT DOWN AND LET ME LOOK AT YOU I DON'T THINK SHE'S MUCH CHANGED THIS WAS VERY DISTRESSING TO POOR MARY WHO WITH ALL HER DESIRE TO OBLIGE THE MARCHIONESS
7135-80033-0035 SO THAT POOR LITTLE BOY HAS GONE MY DEAR I WAS SO SORRY TO HEAR IT YES OF COURSE THAT WAS QUITE PROPER WHEN ANYBODY DIES WE OUGHT TO BE SORRY FOR THEM I'M SURE I DID ALL I COULD TO MAKE THINGS COMFORTABLE FOR HIM DIDN'T I SUSANNA
7135-80033-0036 SO I WAS QUITE ANXIOUS
7135-80033-0037 AND IN ORDER TO GET OVER THE DIFFICULTY SUSANNA SUGGESTED THAT MARY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GO DOWN TO LUNCH CERTAINLY MY DEAR IN HER CONDITION SHE OUGHT NOT TO BE KEPT WAITING A MINUTE AND MIND SUSANNA SHE HAS BOTTLED PORTER I SPOKE ABOUT IT BEFORE
7135-80033-0038 THAT WAS BEFORE POPENJOY WAS BORN I MEAN BROTHERTON
7135-80033-0039 AS MARY WAS ESCAPING FROM THE ROOM SHE WAS NOT EXPECTED TO MAKE CLOAKS AND SKIRTS BUT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO FIGHT AGAINST A WORSE SERVITUDE EVEN THAN THAT
7135-80033-0040 THERE WAS A CRUELTY IN REFUSING
7135-80033-0041 MISERY THE MARCHIONESS EVIDENTLY THOUGHT THAT THE FUTURE STABILITY OF THE FAMILY DEPENDED ON MARY'S QUIESCENCE AND CAPABILITY FOR DRINKING BEER VERY MANY LIES WERE NECESSARILY TOLD HER BY ALL THE FAMILY
7135-80033-0042 SHE WAS MADE TO BELIEVE THAT MARY NEVER GOT UP BEFORE ELEVEN AND THE DOCTOR WHO CAME TO SEE HERSELF AND TO WHOSE SPECIAL CARE MARY WAS OF COURSE RECOMMENDED
7135-80033-0043 OF COURSE HE WAS POPENJOY WHEN HE WAS BORN I DON'T THINK THEY'VE ANY PHYSICIANS LIKE SIR HENRY NOW I DO HOPE IT'LL BE A POPENJOY BUT THAT CAN'T BE MOTHER YOU ARE FORGETTING
7135-80033-0044 THE OLD WOMAN THOUGHT FOR A WHILE AND THEN REMEMBERED THE DIFFICULTY NO NOT QUITE AT ONCE THEN HER MIND WANDERED AGAIN
7135-80033-0045 AND IT'S ALL IN THE HANDS OF GOD THEN THE NEXT MAY BE MY THREE FIRST WERE ALL GIRLS
7135-80033-0046 BUT SIR HENRY SAID THE NEXT WOULD BE A POPENJOY AND
7135-80033-0047 I HOPE THIS WILL BE A POPENJOY BECAUSE I MIGHT DIE BEFORE THE NEXT WHEN A WEEK OF ALL THIS HAD BEEN ENDURED MARY IN HER HEART WAS GLAD THAT THE SENTENCE OF EXPULSION FROM MANOR CROSS STILL STOOD AGAINST HER HUSBAND
7135-80033-0048 FEELING THAT SIX MONTHS OF REITERATED LONGINGS FOR A POPENJOY WOULD KILL HER AND THE POSSIBLE POPENJOY ALSO THEN CAME THE TERRIBLE QUESTION OF AN IMMEDIATE RESIDENCE THE MONTH WAS NEARLY OVER
7135-80033-0049 MARY BEGGED TO BE TAKEN WITH HIM BUT TO THIS HE WOULD NOT ACCEDE ALLEGING THAT HIS SOJOURN THERE WOULD ONLY BE TEMPORARY TILL SOMETHING SHOULD BE SETTLED
7135-80033-0050 YOUR BROTHER WOULD DISLIKE MY BEING HERE WORSE THAN YOU THAT MIGHT BE TRUE BUT THE EDICT AS IT HAD BEEN PRONOUNCED HAD NOT BEEN AGAINST HER
7135-80033-0051 WHY SHOULDN'T YOU TAKE IT WHERE ON EARTH SHOULD I GET THE MONEY COULDN'T WE ALL DO IT AMONG US HE WOULDN'T LET IT TO US HE WILL ALLOW MY MOTHER AND SISTERS TO LIVE HERE FOR NOTHING
7135-80033-0052 BUT I AM TO BE BANISHED HE MUST BE MAD MAD OR NOT I MUST GO DO DO LET ME GO WITH YOU DO GO TO THE DEANERY PAPA WILL MAKE IT ALL SQUARE BY COMING UP TO US IN LONDON
7135-80033-0053 YOUR FATHER HAS A RIGHT TO BE IN THE HOUSE IN LONDON
7135-80033-0054 WHEN THE MONTH WAS OVER HE DID GO UP TO TOWN AND SAW MISTER KNOX MISTER KNOX ADVISED HIM TO GO BACK TO MANOR CROSS DECLARING THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD TAKE NO FURTHER STEPS WITHOUT FURTHER ORDERS
7135-80033-0055 SUPPOSING HOWEVER THAT HE WAS IN HIS HOUSE ON THE LAKE BUT HE DID KNOW THAT THE MARCHIONESS WAS NOT WITH HIM AS SEPARATE APPLICATION HAD BEEN MADE TO HIM BY HER LADYSHIP FOR MONEY
7135-80033-0056 HE REMAINED UP IN TOWN DOING NOTHING DOUBTFUL AS TO WHERE HE SHOULD GO AND WHITHER HE SHOULD TAKE HIS WIFE WHILE SHE WAS STILL AT MANOR CROSS ABSOLUTELY IN THE PURPLE BUT STILL NOT SATISFIED WITH HER POSITION
7135-80033-0057 BY A HIGHSPIRITED LETTER FROM HER FRIEND MISSUS JONES
7135-80033-0058 AND OF COURSE IT WOULD NOT BE FIT THAT YOU SHOULD BE AMUSING YOURSELF WITH WICKED IDLE PEOPLE LIKE US WHILE ALL THE FUTURE OF ALL THE GERMAINS IS SO TO SAY IN YOUR KEEPING HOW VERY OPPORTUNE THAT THAT POOR BOY SHOULD HAVE GONE
7135-80033-0059 JUST AS THE OTHER IS COMING MIND THAT YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL AND TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES I DARESAY ALL THE GERMAIN LADIES ARE LOOKING AFTER YOU DAY AND NIGHT
7135-80033-0060 NO MORE KAPPA KAPPAS FOR MANY A LONG DAY FOR YOU
7135-80033-0061 I THOUGHT CART ROPES WOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT HIM
7135-80033-0062 I REALLY THINK HE IS VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER AND SHE BEHAVES QUITE PRETTILY
7135-80033-0063 THE LOVER DIDN'T MAKE THE LEAST FIGHT WHEN PAPA APPEARED BUT SUBMITTED HIMSELF LIKE A SHEEP TO THE SHEARERS
7135-80033-0064 THERE ARE SOME MEN WHO NEVER REALLY GET ON THEIR LEGS TILL THEY'RE MARRIED AND NEVER WOULD GET MARRIED WITHOUT A LITTLE HELP I'M SURE HE'LL BLESS ME
7135-80033-0065 I GOT HIM TO TELL ME THAT HE'D SEEN YOU AT BROTHERTON AND THEN HE TALKED A DEAL OF NONSENSE ABOUT THE GOOD YOU'D DO WHEN YOU WERE MARCHIONESS
7135-80033-0066 WHY YOU SHOULD DO MORE GOOD THAN OTHER PEOPLE
7135-80033-0067 AND KEEP A GOOD HOUSE AND GIVE NICE PARTIES TRY AND MAKE OTHER PEOPLE HAPPY THAT'S THE GOODNESS I BELIEVE IN
7135-80033-0068 AND THEN HE TALKED A DEAL MORE NONSENSE WHICH I NEED NOT REPEAT
7135-80033-0069 AND WALKED INTO DINNER LIKE A CHRISTIAN THEY SAY THAT HE IS ALL ALONE IN ITALY AND THAT HE WON'T SEE HER I FANCY HE WAS MORE HURT IN THAT LITTLE AFFAIR THAN SOME PEOPLE WILL ALLOW WHATEVER IT WAS IT SERVED HIM RIGHT
7135-80033-0070 I ALWAYS TELL THE TRUTH MY DEAR ABOUT THESE THINGS
7135-80033-0071 AND THEN YOUR POPENJOY WILL BE
7135-80033-0072 YOU REMEMBER THE BARONESS YOUR BARONESS OH THE BARONESS
7135-80033-0073 SHE GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT MADE NO DIFFERENCE THEN I WAS OBLIGED TO TELL HER THAT I HADN'T A
7135-80033-0074 AND THEN I LEFT HER GOOD BYE MIND YOU ARE GOOD AND TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND WHATEVER YOU DO LET POPENJOY HAVE A ROYAL GODFATHER THEN HER FATHER CAME OVER TO SEE HER
7135-80033-0075 AT THIS TIME LORD GEORGE WAS UP IN TOWN AND WHEN HER FATHER WAS ANNOUNCED SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS NO ONE TO HELP HER IF NONE OF THE LADIES OF THE FAMILY WOULD SEE HER FATHER
7135-80033-0076 THIS WAS THE TURNING POINT SHE COULD FORGIVE THEM FOR THE OLD QUARREL
7135-80033-0077 THEN THEY HAD QUARRELLED WITH HER TOO NOW THEY HAD RECEIVED HER BACK INTO THEIR FAVOUR BUT SHE WOULD HAVE NONE OF THEIR FAVOURS UNLESS THEY WOULD TAKE HER FATHER WITH HER SHE WAS SITTING AT THE TIME IN THAT
7135-80033-0078 ODIOUS ARM CHAIR IN THE OLD LADY'S ROOM AND WHEN MISSUS TOFF BROUGHT IN WORD THAT THE DEAN WAS IN THE LITTLE DRAWING ROOM LADY SUSANNA WAS ALSO PRESENT MARY JUMPED UP IMMEDIATELY AND KNEW THAT SHE WAS BLUSHING OH I MUST GO DOWN TO PAPA SHE SAID
7135-80033-0079 AND WOULD LEAVE BROTHERTON WITHIN A MONTH I
7135-80033-0080 HE'S BEEN ACTING NOT QUITE ON THE SQUARE WITH A YOUNG LADY AND THE BISHOP MADE HIM TAKE IT IT WAS THAT OR NOTHING THE DEAN WAS QUITE DELIGHTED AND WHEN MARY TOLD HIM SOMETHING OF HER TROUBLES HOW IMPOSSIBLE SHE FOUND IT TO DRINK BOTTLED PORTER
7135-80033-0081 HE LAUGHED AND BADE HER BE OF GOOD CHEER AND TOLD HER THAT THERE WERE GOOD DAYS COMING THEY HAD BEEN THERE FOR NEARLY AN HOUR TOGETHER AND MARY WAS BECOMING UNHAPPY IF HER FATHER WERE ALLOWED TO GO WITHOUT SOME RECOGNITION FROM THE FAMILY
7135-80033-0082 SHE WOULD NEVER AGAIN BE FRIENDS WITH THOSE WOMEN SHE WAS BEGINNING TO THINK THAT SHE NEVER WOULD BE FRIENDS AGAIN WITH ANY OF THEM WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND LADY SARAH ENTERED THE ROOM THE GREETING
7135-80033-0083 WAS VERY CIVIL ON BOTH SIDES LADY SARAH COULD IF SHE PLEASED BE GRACIOUS THOUGH SHE WAS ALWAYS A LITTLE GRAND AND THE DEAN WAS QUITE WILLING TO BE PLEASED IF ONLY ANY EFFORT WAS MADE TO PLEASE HIM
7135-80033-0084 LADY SARAH HOPED THAT HE WOULD STAY AND DINE HE WOULD PERHAPS EXCUSE THE MARCHIONESS AS SHE RARELY NOW LEFT HER ROOM THE DEAN COULD NOT DINE AT MANOR CROSS ON THAT DAY
