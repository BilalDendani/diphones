2089-148996-0038 BUT FOR HEAVEN'S HELP AND HUMAN PITY AH ME IT DOES SEEM AS IF LIFE WAS MADE OF PARTINGS AND THEY GET HARDER AS WE GO ON
2089-148996-0039 AS SHE SAT IN THE LONG PARLOUR AT PARNASSUS ONE EVENING WHITHER THE FAMILY HAD GONE TO WELCOME THE TRAVELLERS BACK AND MEETINGS TOO DEAR FOR HERE WE ARE AND NAT IS ON HIS WAY AT LAST LOOK FOR THE SILVER LINING AS MARMEE USED TO SAY
2089-148996-0040 AND BE COMFORTED ANSWERED MISSUS AMY GLAD TO BE AT HOME AND FIND NO WOLVES PROWLING NEAR HER SHEEPFOLD I'VE BEEN SO WORRIED LATELY I CAN'T HELP CROAKING I WONDER WHAT DAN THOUGHT AT NOT SEEING YOU AGAIN

2089-148996-0042 AND SLIPPED AWAY BEFORE HE CAME BESS REALLY SEEMED RELIEVED I'M SURE I WAS AND MISSUS AMY SMOOTHED AN ANXIOUS LINE
2089-148996-0043 MISSUS JO SHOOK HER HEAD AS IF THE SILVER LINING OF THAT CLOUD WAS HARD TO FIND BUT SHE HAD NO TIME TO CROAK AGAIN FOR JUST THEN MISTER LAURIE CAME IN LOOKING WELL PLEASED AT SOMETHING
2089-148996-0044 THIS CAUSED A LAUGH AND MADE THINGS GAY AND COMFORTABLE AT ONCE
2089-148996-0045 TO BE KEPT UP BRISKLY WHILE THE BOYS ADMIRED NAT'S BLOND BEARD AND FOREIGN CLOTHES THE GIRLS HIS IMPROVED APPEARANCE FOR HE WAS RUDDY WITH GOOD ENGLISH BEEF AND BEER AND FRESH WITH THE SEA BREEZES WHICH HAD BLOWN HIM SWIFTLY HOME
2089-148996-0046 AND THE OLDER FOLK REJOICED OVER HIS PROSPECTS OF COURSE ALL WANTED TO HEAR HIM PLAY AND WHEN TONGUES TIRED HE GLADLY DID HIS BEST FOR THEM SURPRISING THE MOST CRITICAL BY HIS PROGRESS IN MUSIC EVEN MORE THAN BY THE ENERGY AND SELF POSSESSION
2089-148996-0047 WHICH MADE A NEW MAN OF BASHFUL NAT BY AND BY WHEN THE VIOLIN THAT MOST HUMAN OF ALL INSTRUMENTS HAD SUNG TO THEM THE LOVELIEST SONGS WITHOUT WORDS HE SAID LOOKING ABOUT HIM AT THESE OLD FRIENDS WITH WHAT MISTER BHAER CALLED A
2089-148996-0048 THE FIRST NIGHT HE CAME TO PLUMFIELD THEY REMEMBERED IT AND JOINED IN THE PLAINTIVE CHORUS WHICH FITLY EXPRESSED HIS OWN EMOTIONS OH MY HEART IS SAD AND WEARY EVERYWHERE I ROAM LONGING FOR THE OLD PLANTATION
2089-148996-0049 AND FOR THE OLD FOLKS AT HOME NOW I FEEL BETTER SAID MISSUS JO AS THEY ALL TROOPED DOWN THE HILL SOON AFTER SOME OF OUR BOYS ARE FAILURES BUT I THINK THIS ONE IS GOING TO BE A SUCCESS

2089-148996-0052 US AND BE GLAD EVEN FOR A SMALL ONE HEART'S DEAREST I THOUGHT THE SEED HAD FALLEN ON VERY STONY GROUND WITH MY POOR DAN BUT I SHALL NOT BE SURPRISED IF HE SURPASSES ALL THE REST IN THE REAL SUCCESS OF LIFE
2089-148996-0053 SINCE THERE IS MORE REJOICING OVER ONE REPENTANT SINNER THAN MANY SAINTS ANSWERED MISSUS JO STILL CLINGING FAST TO HER BLACK SHEEP ALTHOUGH A WHOLE FLOCK OF WHITE ONES TROTTED HAPPILY BEFORE HER
2089-148996-0054 IT IS A STRONG TEMPTATION TO THE WEARY HISTORIAN TO CLOSE THE PRESENT TALE WITH AN EARTHQUAKE WHICH SHOULD ENGULF PLUMFIELD AND ITS ENVIRONS SO DEEPLY IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH THAT NO YOUTHFUL SCHLIEMANN COULD EVER FIND A VESTIGE OF IT
2089-148996-0055 BUT AS THAT SOMEWHAT MELODRAMATIC CONCLUSION MIGHT SHOCK MY GENTLE READERS I WILL REFRAIN AND FORESTALL THE USUAL QUESTION HOW DID THEY END BY BRIEFLY STATING THAT ALL THE MARRIAGES TURNED OUT WELL THE BOYS PROSPERED IN THEIR VARIOUS CALLINGS SO DID THE GIRLS
2089-148996-0056 DAN NEVER MARRIED BUT LIVED BRAVELY AND USEFULLY AMONG HIS CHOSEN PEOPLE TILL HE WAS SHOT DEFENDING THEM AND AT LAST LAY QUIETLY ASLEEP IN THE GREEN WILDERNESS HE LOVED SO WELL WITH A LOCK OF GOLDEN HAIR UPON HIS BREAST AND A SMILE ON HIS FACE WHICH SEEMED TO SAY
2089-148996-0057 THAT ASLAUGA'S KNIGHT HAD FOUGHT HIS LAST FIGHT AND WAS AT PEACE STUFFY BECAME AN ALDERMAN AND DIED SUDDENLY OF APOPLEXY AFTER A PUBLIC DINNER DOLLY WAS A SOCIETY MAN OF MARK TILL HE LOST HIS MONEY
2089-148996-0058 DEMI BECAME A PARTNER AND LIVED TO SEE HIS NAME ABOVE THE DOOR AND ROB WAS A PROFESSOR AT LAURENCE COLLEGE BUT TEDDY ECLIPSED THEM ALL BY BECOMING AN ELOQUENT AND FAMOUS CLERGYMAN TO THE GREAT DELIGHT OF HIS ASTONISHED MOTHER
