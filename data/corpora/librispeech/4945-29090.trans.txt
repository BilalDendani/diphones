4945-29090-0000 ARRIVED AT THE FINEST DWELLING IN THE TOWN THEY ENTERED IT AND WERE AT HOME WASHINGTON WAS INTRODUCED TO MISSUS BOSWELL AND HIS IMAGINATION WAS ON THE POINT OF FLITTING INTO THE VAPORY REALMS OF SPECULATION AGAIN
4945-29090-0001 BEAUTY HAD FASCINATED HIM BEFORE MANY TIMES HE HAD BEEN IN LOVE EVEN FOR WEEKS AT A TIME WITH THE SAME OBJECT BUT HIS HEART HAD NEVER SUFFERED SO SUDDEN AND SO FIERCE AN ASSAULT AS THIS WITHIN HIS RECOLLECTION
4945-29090-0002 HOW HER VOICE THRILLED HIM WHEN SHE FIRST SPOKE HOW CHARMED THE VERY AIR SEEMED BY HER PRESENCE BLISSFUL AS THE AFTERNOON WAS DELIVERED UP TO SUCH A REVEL AS THIS IT SEEMED AN ETERNITY SO IMPATIENT WAS HE TO SEE THE GIRL AGAIN
4945-29090-0003 OTHER AFTERNOONS LIKE IT FOLLOWED WASHINGTON PLUNGED INTO THIS LOVE AFFAIR AS HE PLUNGED INTO EVERYTHING ELSE UPON IMPULSE AND WITHOUT REFLECTION AS THE DAYS WENT BY
4945-29090-0004 AND STRAIGHTWAY HIS POVERTY BECAME A TORTURE TO HIM WHICH CAST ALL HIS FORMER SUFFERINGS UNDER THAT HELD INTO THE SHADE HE LONGED FOR RICHES NOW AS HE HAD NEVER LONGED FOR THEM BEFORE
4945-29090-0005 HE HAD BEEN ONCE OR TWICE TO DINE WITH COLONEL SELLERS AND HAD BEEN DISCOURAGED TO NOTE THAT THE COLONEL'S BILL OF FARE WAS FALLING OFF BOTH IN QUANTITY AND QUALITY A SIGN HE FEARED THAT THE LACKING INGREDIENT IN THE EYE WATER STILL REMAINED UNDISCOVERED
4945-29090-0006 THOUGH SELLERS ALWAYS EXPLAINED THAT THESE CHANGES IN THE FAMILY DIET HAD BEEN ORDERED BY THE DOCTOR OR SUGGESTED BY SOME NEW SCIENTIFIC WORK THE COLONEL HAD STUMBLED UPON BUT IT ALWAYS TURNED OUT THAT THE LACKING INGREDIENT WAS STILL LACKING
4945-29090-0007 THOUGH IT ALWAYS APPEARED AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE COLONEL WAS RIGHT ON ITS HEELS EVERY TIME THE COLONEL CAME INTO THE REAL ESTATE OFFICE WASHINGTON'S HEART BOUNDED AND HIS EYES LIGHTED WITH HOPE
4945-29090-0008 BUT IT ALWAYS TURNED OUT THAT THE COLONEL WAS MERELY ON THE SCENT OF SOME VAST UNDEFINED LANDED SPECULATION ALTHOUGH HE WAS CUSTOMARILY ABLE TO SAY THAT HE WAS NEARER TO THE ALL NECESSARY INGREDIENT THAN EVER AND COULD ALMOST NAME THE HOUR WHEN SUCCESS WOULD DAWN
4945-29090-0009 AND THEN WASHINGTON'S HEART WOULD SINK AGAIN AND A SIGH WOULD TELL WHEN IT TOUCHED BOTTOM ABOUT THIS TIME A LETTER CAME SAYING THAT JUDGE HAWKINS HAD BEEN AILING FOR A FORTNIGHT AND WAS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE SERIOUSLY ILL
4945-29090-0010 IT WAS THOUGHT BEST THAT WASHINGTON SHOULD COME HOME THE NEWS FILLED HIM WITH GRIEF FOR HE LOVED AND HONORED HIS FATHER THE BOSWELLS WERE TOUCHED BY THE YOUTH'S SORROW AND EVEN THE GENERAL UNBENT AND SAID ENCOURAGING THINGS TO HIM
4945-29090-0011 THERE WAS BALM IN THIS BUT WHEN LOUISE BADE HIM GOOD BYE AND SHOOK HIS HAND AND SAID DON'T BE CAST DOWN IT WILL ALL COME OUT RIGHT I KNOW IT WILL ALL COME OUT RIGHT IT SEEMED A BLESSED THING TO BE IN MISFORTUNE
4945-29090-0012 AND THE TEARS THAT WELLED UP TO HIS EYES WERE THE MESSENGERS OF AN ADORING AND A GRATEFUL HEART AND WHEN THE GIRL SAW THEM AND ANSWERING TEARS CAME INTO HER OWN EYES WASHINGTON COULD HARDLY CONTAIN THE EXCESS OF HAPPINESS THAT POURED INTO THE CAVITIES OF HIS BREAST
4945-29090-0013 THAT WERE SO LATELY STORED TO THE ROOF WITH GRIEF ALL THE WAY HOME HE NURSED HIS WOE AND EXALTED IT HE PICTURED HIMSELF AS SHE MUST BE PICTURING HIM
4945-29090-0014 A NOBLE STRUGGLING YOUNG SPIRIT PERSECUTED BY MISFORTUNE BUT BRAVELY AND PATIENTLY WAITING IN THE SHADOW OF A DREAD CALAMITY AND PREPARING TO MEET THE BLOW AS BECAME ONE WHO WAS ALL TOO USED TO HARD FORTUNE
4945-29090-0015 THESE THOUGHTS MADE HIM WEEP AND WEEP MORE BROKEN HEARTEDLY THAN EVER AND HE WISHED THAT SHE COULD SEE HIS SUFFERINGS NOW THERE WAS NOTHING SIGNIFICANT IN THE FACT THAT LOUISE DREAMY AND DISTRAUGHT
4945-29090-0016 STOOD AT HER BEDROOM BUREAU THAT NIGHT SCRIBBLING WASHINGTON HERE AND THERE OVER A SHEET OF PAPER BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT IN THE FACT THAT SHE SCRATCHED THE WORD OUT EVERY TIME SHE WROTE IT EXAMINED THE ERASURE CRITICALLY TO SEE IF ANYBODY COULD GUESS AT WHAT THE WORD HAD BEEN
4945-29090-0017 THEN BURIED IT UNDER A MAZE OF OBLITERATING LINES AND FINALLY AS IF STILL UNSATISFIED BURNED THE PAPER WHEN WASHINGTON REACHED HOME HE RECOGNIZED AT ONCE HOW SERIOUS HIS FATHER'S CASE WAS
4945-29090-0018 THE DARKENED ROOM THE LABORED BREATHING AND OCCASIONAL MOANINGS OF THE PATIENT THE TIP TOEING OF THE ATTENDANTS AND THEIR WHISPERED CONSULTATIONS WERE FULL OF SAD MEANING FOR THREE OR FOUR NIGHTS MISSUS HAWKINS AND LAURA HAD BEEN WATCHING BY THE BEDSIDE
4945-29090-0019 CLAY HAD ARRIVED PRECEDING WASHINGTON BY ONE DAY AND HE WAS NOW ADDED TO THE CORPS OF WATCHERS MISTER HAWKINS WOULD HAVE NONE BUT THESE THREE THOUGH NEIGHBORLY ASSISTANCE WAS OFFERED BY OLD FRIENDS
4945-29090-0020 FROM THIS TIME FORTH THREE HOUR WATCHES WERE INSTITUTED AND DAY AND NIGHT THE WATCHERS KEPT THEIR VIGILS BY DEGREES LAURA AND HER MOTHER BEGAN TO SHOW WEAR BUT NEITHER OF THEM WOULD YIELD A MINUTE OF THEIR TASKS TO CLAY
4945-29090-0021 CLAY IS NOT GOOD FATHER HE DID NOT CALL ME I WOULD NOT HAVE TREATED HIM SO HOW COULD YOU DO IT CLAY CLAY BEGGED FORGIVENESS AND PROMISED NOT TO BREAK FAITH AGAIN
4945-29090-0022 AND AS HE BETOOK HIM TO HIS BED HE SAID TO HIMSELF IT'S A STEADFAST LITTLE SOUL WHOEVER THINKS HE IS DOING THE DUCHESS A KINDNESS BY INTIMATING THAT SHE IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR ANY UNDERTAKING SHE PUTS HER HAND TO MAKES A MISTAKE
4945-29090-0023 THAN BY TRYING TO LIGHTEN HER LABOR WHEN THAT LABOR CONSISTS IN WEARING HERSELF OUT FOR THE SAKE OF A PERSON SHE LOVES A WEEK DRIFTED BY AND ALL THE WHILE THE PATIENT SANK LOWER AND LOWER
4945-29090-0024 THE NIGHT DREW ON THAT WAS TO END ALL SUSPENSE IT WAS A WINTRY ONE THE DARKNESS GATHERED THE SNOW WAS FALLING THE WIND WAILED PLAINTIVELY ABOUT THE HOUSE OR SHOOK IT WITH FITFUL GUSTS
4945-29090-0025 THE DOCTOR HAD PAID HIS LAST VISIT AND GONE AWAY WITH THAT DISMAL REMARK TO THE NEAREST FRIEND OF THE FAMILY THAT HE BELIEVED THERE WAS NOTHING MORE THAT HE COULD DO A REMARK WHICH IS ALWAYS OVERHEARD BY SOME ONE IT IS NOT MEANT FOR
4945-29090-0026 AND STRIKES A LINGERING HALF CONSCIOUS HOPE DEAD WITH A WITHERING SHOCK THE MEDICINE PHIALS HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE BEDSIDE AND PUT OUT OF SIGHT AND ALL THINGS MADE ORDERLY AND MEET FOR THE SOLEMN EVENT THAT WAS IMPENDING
4945-29090-0027 THE PATIENT WITH CLOSED EYES LAY SCARCELY BREATHING THE WATCHERS SAT BY AND WIPED THE GATHERING DAMPS FROM HIS FOREHEAD WHILE THE SILENT TEARS FLOWED DOWN THEIR FACES THE DEEP HUSH WAS ONLY INTERRUPTED BY SOBS FROM THE CHILDREN
4945-29090-0028 THE DARKNESS GROWS LET ME SEE YOU ALL ONCE MORE THE GROUP CLOSED TOGETHER AT THE BEDSIDE AND THEIR TEARS AND SOBS CAME NOW WITHOUT RESTRAINT
4945-29090-0029 I AM LEAVING YOU IN CRUEL POVERTY I HAVE BEEN SO FOOLISH SO SHORT SIGHTED BUT COURAGE A BETTER DAY IS
4945-29090-0030 IS COMING NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THE TENNESSEE LAND BE WARY THERE IS WEALTH STORED UP FOR YOU THERE WEALTH THAT IS BOUNDLESS
4945-29090-0031 HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND THE SIGNS OF APPROACHING DISSOLUTION MULTIPLIED RAPIDLY HE LAY ALMOST MOTIONLESS FOR A LITTLE WHILE THEN SUDDENLY PARTLY RAISED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM AS ONE WHO PEERS INTO A DIM
4945-29090-0032 UNCERTAIN LIGHT HE MUTTERED GONE NO I SEE YOU STILL IT IS IT IS OVER
4945-29090-0033 THE EMACIATED FINGERS BEGAN TO PICK AT THE COVERLET A FATAL SIGN AFTER A TIME THERE WERE NO SOUNDS BUT THE CRIES OF THE MOURNERS WITHIN AND THE GUSTY TURMOIL OF THE WIND WITHOUT
4945-29090-0034 ITS HOPES OR ITS AMBITIONS CLAY BURIED HIS FACE IN THE COVERLET OF THE BED WHEN THE OTHER CHILDREN AND THE MOTHER REALIZED THAT DEATH WAS INDEED COME AT LAST THEY THREW THEMSELVES INTO EACH OTHERS ARMS
