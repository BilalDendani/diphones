1347-164338-0000 ASKED ROULETABILLE PERFECTLY REPLIED ARTHUR RANCE I RECOGNISE YOU AS THE LAD AT THE BAR THE FACE OF ROULETABILLE CRIMSONED AT BEING CALLED A LAD I WANT TO SHAKE HANDS WITH YOU
1347-164338-0001 YOU ARE A BRIGHT LITTLE FELLOW THE AMERICAN EXTENDED HIS HAND AND ROULETABILLE RELAXING HIS FROWN SHOOK IT AND INTRODUCED MISTER ARTHUR RANCE TO ME
1347-164338-0002 HE INVITED HIM TO SHARE OUR MEAL NO THANKS I BREAKFASTED WITH MONSIEUR STANGERSON ARTHUR RANCE SPOKE FRENCH PERFECTLY ALMOST WITHOUT AN ACCENT
1347-164338-0003 I THOUGHT YOU WERE TO HAVE LEFT FRANCE THE DAY AFTER THE RECEPTION AT THE ELYSEE ROULETABILLE AND I OUTWARDLY INDIFFERENT LISTENED MOST INTENTLY
1347-164338-0004 FOR EVERY WORD THE AMERICAN WOULD SAY THE MAN'S PURPLISH RED FACE
1347-164338-0005 THE NERVOUS TWITCHINGS ALL SPOKE OF HIS ADDICTION TO DRINK HOW CAME IT THAT SO SORRY A SPECIMEN OF A MAN SHOULD BE SO INTIMATE WITH MONSIEUR STANGERSON
1347-164338-0006 SOME DAYS LATER I LEARNED FROM FREDERIC LARSAN
1347-164338-0007 LIKE OURSELVES WAS SURPRISED AND MYSTIFIED BY HIS APPEARANCE AND RECEPTION AT THE CHATEAU THAT MISTER RANCE HAD BEEN AN INEBRIATE FOR ONLY ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS THAT IS TO SAY
1347-164338-0008 SINCE THE PROFESSOR AND HIS DAUGHTER LEFT PHILADELPHIA DURING THE TIME THE STANGERSONS LIVED IN AMERICA THEY WERE VERY INTIMATE WITH ARTHUR RANCE
1347-164338-0009 WHO WAS ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED PHRENOLOGISTS OF THE NEW WORLD OWING TO NEW EXPERIMENTS HE HAD MADE ENORMOUS STRIDES BEYOND THE SCIENCE OF GALL AND LAVATER
1347-164338-0010 THE FRIENDLINESS WITH WHICH HE WAS RECEIVED AT THE GLANDIER MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT HE HAD ONCE RENDERED MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON A GREAT SERVICE BY STOPPING
1347-164338-0011 AT THE PERIL OF HIS OWN LIFE THE RUNAWAY HORSES OF HER CARRIAGE THE IMMEDIATE RESULT OF THAT COULD HOWEVER HAVE BEEN NO MORE THAN A MERE FRIENDLY ASSOCIATION WITH THE STANGERSONS
1347-164338-0012 CERTAINLY NOT A LOVE AFFAIR FREDERIC LARSAN DID NOT TELL ME WHERE HE HAD PICKED UP THIS INFORMATION BUT HE APPEARED TO BE QUITE SURE OF WHAT HE SAID
1347-164338-0013 HAD WE KNOWN THESE FACTS AT THE TIME ARTHUR RANCE MET US AT THE DONJON INN
1347-164338-0014 BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO INCREASE OUR INTEREST IN THE MAN HIMSELF
1347-164338-0015 HE SPOKE IN A PERFECTLY NATURAL TONE IN REPLY TO ROULETABILLE'S QUESTION I PUT OFF MY RETURN TO AMERICA WHEN I HEARD OF THE ATTACK ON MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON
1347-164338-0016 I WANTED TO BE CERTAIN THE LADY HAD NOT BEEN KILLED AND I SHALL NOT GO AWAY UNTIL SHE IS PERFECTLY RECOVERED ARTHUR RANCE THEN TOOK THE LEAD IN TALK
1347-164338-0017 PAYING NO HEED TO SOME OF ROULETABILLE'S QUESTIONS HE GAVE US WITHOUT OUR INVITING HIM HIS PERSONAL VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT OF THE TRAGEDY VIEWS WHICH
1347-164338-0018 AS WELL AS I COULD MAKE OUT WERE NOT FAR FROM THOSE HELD BY FREDERIC LARZAN THE AMERICAN ALSO THOUGHT THAT ROBERT DARZAC HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MATTER
1347-164338-0019 HE DID NOT MENTION HIM BY NAME BUT THERE WAS NO ROOM TO DOUBT WHOM HE MEANT HE TOLD US HE WAS AWARE OF THE EFFORTS YOUNG ROULETABILLE WAS MAKING
1347-164338-0020 HE EXPLAINED
1347-164338-0021 THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE INEXPLICABLE GALLERY HE SEVERAL TIMES EXPRESSED HIS REGRET AT MONSIEUR DARZAC'S ABSENCE FROM THE CHATEAU ON ALL THESE OCCASIONS AND THOUGHT
1347-164338-0022 THAT MONSIEUR DARZAC HAD DONE CLEVERLY IN ALLYING HIMSELF WITH MONSIEUR JOSEPH ROULETABILLE WHO COULD NOT FAIL SOONER OR LATER TO DISCOVER THE MURDERER
1347-164338-0023 HE SPOKE THE LAST SENTENCE WITH UNCONCEALED IRONY THEN HE ROSE BOWED TO US AND LEFT
1347-164338-0024 ROULETABILLE WATCHED HIM THROUGH THE WINDOW AN
1347-164338-0025 FISH THAT HE SAID DO YOU THINK HE'LL PASS THE NIGHT AT THE GLANDIER I ASKED TO MY AMAZEMENT THE YOUNG REPORTER ANSWERED THAT IT WAS A MATTER OF ENTIRE INDIFFERENCE TO HIM
1347-164338-0026 THAT ROULETABILLE LED ME TO THE GROTTO OF SAINTE GENEVIEVE AND ALL THE TIME TALKED OF EVERY SUBJECT BUT THE ONE IN WHICH WE WERE MOST INTERESTED
1347-164338-0027 I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND ROULETABILLE MAKING NONE OF THE PREPARATIONS I HAD EXPECTED HIM TO MAKE I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT IT WHEN NIGHT HAD COME ON
1347-164338-0028 AND WE WERE ONCE MORE IN HIS ROOM HE REPLIED
1347-164338-0029 THE MURDERER WOULD NOT GET AWAY FROM HIM I EXPRESSED SOME DOUBT ON THIS REMINDING HIM OF HIS DISAPPEARANCE IN THE GALLERY AND SUGGESTED THAT THE SAME PHENOMENON MIGHT OCCUR AGAIN
1347-164338-0030 HE ANSWERED THAT HE HOPED IT WOULD HE DESIRED NOTHING MORE I DID NOT INSIST KNOWING BY EXPERIENCE HOW USELESS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HE TOLD ME THAT
1347-164338-0031 THE CHATEAU HAD SINCE EARLY DAWN BEEN WATCHED IN SUCH A WAY THAT NOBODY COULD APPROACH IT WITHOUT HIS KNOWING IT AND THAT HE HAD NO CONCERN FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE LEFT IT AND REMAINED WITHOUT
1347-164338-0032 IT WAS THEN SIX O'CLOCK BY HIS WATCH RISING HE MADE A SIGN TO ME TO FOLLOW HIM AND WITHOUT IN THE LEAST TYING TO CONCEAL HIS MOVEMENTS OR THE SOUND OF HIS FOOTSTEPS
1347-164338-0033 HE LED ME THROUGH THE GALLERY WE REACHED THE RIGHT GALLERY AND CAME TO THE LANDING PLACE WHICH WE CROSSED WE THEN CONTINUED OUR WAY IN THE GALLERY OF THE LEFT WING
1347-164338-0034 PASSING PROFESSOR STANGERSON'S APARTMENT AT THE FAR END OF THE GALLERY BEFORE COMING TO THE DONJON IS THE ROOM OCCUPIED BY ARTHUR RANCE WE KNEW THAT
1347-164338-0035 BECAUSE WE HAD SEEN HIM AT THE WINDOW LOOKING ON TO THE COURT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM OPENS ON TO THE END OF THE GALLERY EXACTLY FACING THE EAST WINDOW AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE RIGHT GALLERY
1347-164338-0036 AND COMMANDS AN UNINTERRUPTED VIEW OF THE GALLERY FROM END TO END OF THE CHATEAU THAT OFF TURNING GALLERY SAID ROULETABILLE I RESERVE FOR MYSELF WHEN I TELL YOU
1347-164338-0037 YOU'LL COME AND TAKE YOUR PLACE HERE
1347-164338-0038 TRIANGULAR CLOSET BUILT IN A BEND OF THE WALL TO THE LEFT OF THE DOOR OF ARTHUR RANCE'S ROOM FROM THIS RECESS I COULD SEE ALL THAT OCCURRED IN THE GALLERY
1347-164338-0039 AS WELL AS IF I HAD BEEN STANDING IN FRONT OF ARTHUR RANCE'S DOOR AND I COULD WATCH THAT DOOR TOO THE DOOR OF THE CLOSET WHICH WAS TO BE MY PLACE OF OBSERVATION
1347-164338-0040 WAS FITTED WITH PANELS OF TRANSPARENT GLASS IN THE GALLERY WHERE ALL THE LAMPS HAD BEEN LIT IT WAS QUITE LIGHT IN THE CLOSET HOWEVER IT WAS QUITE DARK
1347-164338-0041 IT WAS A SPLENDID PLACE FROM WHICH TO OBSERVE AND REMAIN UNOBSERVED I WAS SOON TO PLAY THE PART OF A SPY A COMMON POLICEMAN
1347-164338-0042 I WAS NOT ALTOGETHER PLEASED WITH MY DUTIES BUT I COULD NOT REFUSE ROULETABILLE THE ASSISTANCE HE HAD BEGGED ME TO GIVE HIM I TOOK CARE NOT TO MAKE HIM SEE
1347-164338-0043 THAT I IN THE LEAST OBJECTED AND FOR SEVERAL REASONS I WANTED TO OBLIGE HIM I DID NOT WISH HIM TO THINK ME A COWARD I WAS FILLED WITH CURIOSITY
1347-164338-0044 AND IT WAS TOO LATE FOR ME TO DRAW BACK EVEN HAD I DETERMINED TO DO SO THAT I HAD NOT HAD THESE SCRUPLES SOONER WAS BECAUSE MY CURIOSITY HAD QUITE GOT THE BETTER OF ME
1347-164338-0045 I MIGHT ALSO URGE THAT I WAS HELPING TO SAVE THE LIFE OF A WOMAN AND EVEN A LAWYER
1347-164338-0046 WE RETURNED ALONG THE GALLERY ON REACHING THE DOOR OF MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON'S APARTMENT IT OPENED FROM A PUSH GIVEN BY THE STEWARD WHO WAS WAITING AT THE DINNER TABLE
1347-164338-0047 MONSIEUR STANGERSON HAD FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS DINED WITH HIS DAUGHTER IN THE DRAWING ROOM ON THE FIRST FLOOR AS THE DOOR REMAINED OPEN WE DISTINCTLY SAW MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON
1347-164338-0048 TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE STEWARD'S ABSENCE AND WHILE HER FATHER WAS STOOPING TO PICK UP SOMETHING HE HAD LET FALL
