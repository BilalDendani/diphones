1472-142848-0000 BUT THE ORDINARY BEVERAGES DRUNK IN THE BRITISH ISLES MAY BE DIVIDED INTO THREE CLASSES
1472-142848-0001 BEVERAGES OF THE SIMPLEST KIND NOT FERMENTED TWO BEVERAGES CONSISTING OF WATER CONTAINING A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF CARBONIC ACID THREE BEVERAGES COMPOSED PARTLY OF FERMENTED LIQUORS
1472-142848-0002 OF THE FIRST CLASS MAY BE MENTIONED WATER TOAST AND WATER BARLEY WATER EAU SUCRE LAIT
1472-142848-0003 CHEESE AND MILK WHEY MILK AND WATER LEMONADE ORANGEADE SHERBET APPLE AND PEAR JUICE
1472-142848-0004 WE MAY NAME SODA WATER SINGLE AND DOUBLE ORDINARY EFFERVESCING DRAUGHTS
1472-142848-0005 BISHOP EGG FLIP EGG HOT ALE POSSET SACK POSSET PUNCH
1472-142848-0006 HAS NOW BECOME ALMOST A NECESSARY OF LIFE PREVIOUS TO THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY IT WAS NOT USED IN ENGLAND AND IT WAS WHOLLY UNKNOWN TO THE GREEKS AND ROMANS PEPYS SAYS IN HIS DIARY SEPTEMBER TWENTY FIFTH
1472-142848-0007 THOUGH A DIFFERENCE OF CHARACTER IS PERCEIVED YET THIS IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO AUTHORIZE CONSIDERING THEM AS DISTINCT SPECIES THE TEA TREE FLOURISHES BEST IN TEMPERATE REGIONS IN CHINA IT IS INDIGENOUS
1472-142848-0008 THE PART OF CHINA WHERE THE BEST TEA IS CULTIVATED IS CALLED BY US THE TEA COUNTRY THE CULTIVATION OF THE PLANT REQUIRES GREAT CARE IT IS RAISED CHIEFLY ON THE SIDES OF HILLS
1472-142848-0009 THE SHRUB IS PRUNED SO AS NOT TO EXCEED THE HEIGHT OF FROM TWO TO THREE FEET MUCH IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE VINE IS TREATED IN FRANCE THEY PLUCK THE LEAVES ONE SELECTING THEM ACCORDING TO THE KINDS OF TEA REQUIRED AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE TEDIOUSNESS OF THE OPERATION
1472-142848-0010 EACH LABOURER IS ABLE TO GATHER FROM FOUR TO TEN OR FIFTEEN POUNDS A DAY WHEN THE TREES ATTAIN TO SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OF AGE THE PRODUCE BECOMES SO INFERIOR THAT THEY ARE REMOVED TO MAKE ROOM FOR A FRESH SUCCESSION OR THEY ARE CUT DOWN TO ALLOW OF NUMEROUS YOUNG SHOOTS
1472-142848-0011 TEAS OF THE FINEST FLAVOUR CONSIST OF THE YOUNGEST LEAVES AND AS THESE ARE GATHERED AT FOUR DIFFERENT PERIODS OF THE YEAR THE YOUNGER THE LEAVES THE HIGHER FLAVOURED THE TEA AND THE SCARCER AND CONSEQUENTLY THE DEARER
1472-142848-0012 THERE ARE ABOUT A DOZEN DIFFERENT KINDS BUT THE PRINCIPAL ARE BOHEA CONGOU AND SOUCHONG AND SIGNIFY RESPECTIVELY INFERIOR MIDDLING AND SUPERIOR TEAS ARE OFTEN PERFUMED AND FLAVOURED WITH THE LEAVES OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF PLANTS GROWN ON PURPOSE
1472-142848-0013 DIFFERENT TEA FARMS IN CHINA PRODUCE TEAS OF VARIOUS QUALITIES
1472-142848-0014 IS FOUND TO CONTAIN WOODY FIBRE MUCILAGE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF THE ASTRINGENT PRINCIPLE OR TANNIN A NARCOTIC PRINCIPLE WHICH IS PERHAPS CONNECTED WITH A PECULIAR AROMA THE TANNIN IS SHOWN BY ITS STRIKING A BLACK COLOUR WITH SULPHATE OF IRON
1472-142848-0015 AND IS THE CAUSE OF THE DARK STAIN WHICH IS ALWAYS FORMED WHEN TEA IS SPILT UPON BUFF COLOURED COTTONS DYED WITH IRON
1472-142848-0016 HAS ALSO BEEN DISCOVERED IN TEA SUPPOSED TO BE IDENTICAL WITH CAFFEINE ONE OF THE CONSTITUENTS OF COFFEE
1472-142848-0017 A SERIES OF MOST REMARKABLE PRODUCTS WHICH HAVE MUCH ANALOGY WITH THOSE DERIVED FROM URIC ACID IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES THE INFUSION OF TEA DIFFERS FROM THAT OF COFFEE BY CONTAINING IRON AND MANGANESE WE HAVE IN TEA OF MANY KINDS
1472-142848-0018 A BEVERAGE WHICH CONTAINS THE ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS OF THE MOST POWERFUL MINERAL SPRINGS AND HOWEVER SMALL THE AMOUNT OF IRON MAY BE WHICH WE DAILY TAKE IN THIS FORM
1472-142848-0019 THE LEAVES OF THE SLOE WHITE THORN ASH ELDER AND SOME OTHERS HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED FOR THIS PURPOSE SUCH AS THE LEAVES OF THE SPEEDWELL WILD GERMANDER BLACK CURRANTS SYRINGA PURPLE SPIKED WILLOW HERB SWEET BRIER AND CHERRY TREE
1472-142848-0020 SOME OF THESE ARE HARMLESS OTHERS ARE TO A CERTAIN DEGREE POISONOUS AS FOR EXAMPLE ARE THE LEAVES OF ALL THE VARIETIES OF THE PLUM AND CHERRY TRIBE TO WHICH THE SLOE BELONGS ADULTERATION BY MEANS OF THESE LEAVES IS BY NO MEANS A NEW SPECIES OF FRAUD
1472-142848-0021 SPECIFYING SEVERE PENALTIES AGAINST THOSE GUILTY OF THE OFFENCE
1472-142848-0022 THAT SHOULD BE CHOSEN WHICH POSSESSES AN AGREEABLE ODOUR AND IS AS WHOLE AS POSSIBLE
1472-142848-0023 BUT THE FOLLOWING FACTS CONNECTED WITH COFFEE
1472-142848-0024 WE ARE ASSURED BY BRUCE THAT THE COFFEE TREE IS A NATIVE OF ABYSSINIA
1472-142848-0025 A TURKEY MERCHANT WHOSE SERVANT PASQUA A GREEK UNDERSTOOD THE MANNER OF ROASTING IT THIS SERVANT UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF EDWARDS ESTABLISHED THE FIRST COFFEE HOUSE IN LONDON IN GEORGE YARD LOMBARD STREET
1472-142848-0026 COFFEE WAS THEN SOLD AT FOUR OR FIVE GUINEAS A POUND AND A DUTY WAS SOON AFTERWARDS LAID UPON IT OF FOURPENCE A GALLON WHEN MADE INTO A BEVERAGE IN THE COURSE OF TWO CENTURIES HOWEVER THIS BERRY UNKNOWN ORIGINALLY AS AN ARTICLE OF FOOD
1472-142848-0027 EXCEPT TO SOME SAVAGE TRIBES ON THE CONFINES OF ABYSSINIA HAS MADE ITS WAY THROUGH THE WHOLE OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD MAHOMMEDANS OF ALL RANKS DRINK COFFEE TWICE A DAY IT IS IN UNIVERSAL REQUEST IN FRANCE
1472-142848-0028 AND THE DEMAND FOR IT THROUGHOUT THE BRITISH ISLES IS DAILY INCREASING THE MORE ESPECIALLY SINCE SO MUCH ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO MECHANICAL CONTRIVANCES FOR ROASTING AND GRINDING THE BERRY
1472-142848-0029 IT IS GROWN CHIEFLY IN THE DISTRICTS OF ADEN AND MOCHA WHENCE THE NAME OF OUR MOCHA COFFEE MOCHA COFFEE HAS A SMALLER AND ROUNDER BEAN THAN ANY OTHER AND LIKEWISE A MORE AGREEABLE SMELL AND TASTE
1472-142848-0030 THE NEXT IN REPUTATION AND QUALITY IS THE JAVA AND CEYLON COFFEE AND THEN THE COFFEES OF BOURBON AND MARTINIQUE
1472-142848-0031 INDEPENDENTLY OF ONE OF THE OBJECTS OF ROASTING NAMELY THAT OF DESTROYING ITS TOUGHNESS AND RENDERING IT EASILY GROUND ITS TANNIN AND OTHER PRINCIPLES ARE RENDERED PARTLY SOLUBLE IN WATER AND IT IS TO THE TANNIN THAT THE BROWN COLOUR OF THE DECOCTION OF COFFEE IS OWING
1472-142848-0032 AN AROMATIC FLAVOUR IS LIKEWISE DEVELOPED DURING TORREFACTION WHICH IS NOT PERCEIVED IN THE RAW BERRY
1472-142848-0033 BUT IF THE HEAT BE INCREASED BEYOND THIS THE FLAVOUR IS AGAIN DISSIPATED
1472-142848-0034 AND MUCH OF THE QUALITIES OF THE BEVERAGE DEPENDS UPON THE OPERATION THE ROASTING OF COFFEE FOR THE DEALERS IN LONDON AND PARIS HAS NOW BECOME A SEPARATE BRANCH OF BUSINESS AND SOME OF THE ROASTERS PERFORM THE OPERATION ON A GREAT SCALE WITH CONSIDERABLE SKILL
1472-142848-0035 IF A CUP OF THE BEST COFFEE BE PLACED UPON A TABLE BOILING HOT IT WILL FILL THE ROOM WITH ITS FRAGRANCE BUT THE COFFEE WHEN WARMED AGAIN AFTER BEING COLD
1472-142848-0036 AND THUS OFTEN ACQUIRES A BAD FLAVOUR BROWN SUGAR PLACED NEAR IT WILL COMMUNICATE A DISAGREEABLE FLAVOUR IT IS STATED THAT THE COFFEE IN THE WEST INDIES HAS OFTEN BEEN INJURED BY BEING LAID IN ROOMS NEAR THE SUGAR WORKS OR WHERE RUM IS DISTILLED
