3967-29012-0000 I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO ENJOY THE JOKE OF WHAT'S GOING ON HERE I WROTE BUT SOMEHOW IT DOESN'T AMUSE ME PESSIMISM ON THE CONTRARY POSSESSES ME AND CYNICISM DEEPLY ENGAGES
3967-29012-0001 I POSITIVELY FEEL MY OWN FLESH SORE FROM THE BRASS NAILS IN NEIL PARADAY'S SOCIAL HARNESS THE HOUSE IS FULL OF PEOPLE WHO LIKE HIM AS THEY MENTION AWFULLY
3967-29012-0002 AND WITH WHOM HIS TALENT FOR TALKING NONSENSE HAS PRODIGIOUS SUCCESS I DELIGHT IN HIS NONSENSE MYSELF WHY IS IT THEREFORE THAT I GRUDGE THESE HAPPY FOLK THEIR ARTLESS SATISFACTION MYSTERY OF THE HUMAN HEART
3967-29012-0003 ABYSS OF THE CRITICAL SPIRIT MISSUS WIMBUSH THINKS SHE CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND AS MY WANT OF GAIETY HAS AT LAST WORN OUT HER PATIENCE SHE HAS GIVEN ME A GLIMPSE OF HER SHREWD GUESS
3967-29012-0004 I'M MADE RESTLESS BY THE SELFISHNESS OF THE INSINCERE FRIEND I WANT TO MONOPOLISE PARADAY IN ORDER THAT HE MAY PUSH ME ON TO BE INTIMATE WITH HIM IS A FEATHER IN MY CAP IT GIVES ME AN IMPORTANCE THAT I COULDN'T NATURALLY PRETEND TO
3967-29012-0005 AND I SEEK TO DEPRIVE HIM OF SOCIAL REFRESHMENT BECAUSE I FEAR THAT MEETING MORE DISINTERESTED PEOPLE MAY ENLIGHTEN HIM AS TO MY REAL MOTIVE ALL THE DISINTERESTED PEOPLE HERE ARE HIS PARTICULAR ADMIRERS
3967-29012-0006 AND HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY SELECTED AS SUCH THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A COPY OF HIS LAST BOOK IN THE HOUSE AND IN THE HALL I COME UPON LADIES IN ATTITUDES BENDING GRACEFULLY OVER THE FIRST VOLUME
3967-29012-0007 I DISCREETLY AVERT MY EYES AND WHEN I NEXT LOOK ROUND THE PRECARIOUS JOY HAS BEEN SUPERSEDED BY THE BOOK OF LIFE THERE'S A SOCIABLE CIRCLE OR A CONFIDENTIAL COUPLE AND THE RELINQUISHED VOLUME LIES OPEN ON ITS FACE
3967-29012-0008 AND AS DROPPED UNDER EXTREME COERCION SOMEBODY ELSE PRESENTLY FINDS IT AND TRANSFERS IT WITH ITS AIR OF MOMENTARY DESOLATION TO ANOTHER PIECE OF FURNITURE EVERY ONE'S ASKING EVERY ONE ABOUT IT ALL DAY
3967-29012-0009 AND EVERY ONE'S TELLING EVERY ONE WHERE THEY PUT IT LAST I'M SURE IT'S RATHER SMUDGY ABOUT THE TWENTIETH PAGE I'VE A STRONG IMPRESSION TOO THAT THE SECOND VOLUME IS LOST HAS BEEN PACKED IN THE BAG OF SOME DEPARTING GUEST
3967-29012-0010 AND YET EVERYBODY HAS THE IMPRESSION THAT SOMEBODY ELSE HAS READ TO THE END YOU SEE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAUTIFUL BOOK PLAYS A GREAT PART IN OUR EXISTENCE WHY SHOULD I TAKE THE OCCASION OF SUCH DISTINGUISHED HONOURS
3967-29012-0011 TO SAY THAT I BEGIN TO SEE DEEPER INTO GUSTAVE FLAUBERT'S DOLEFUL REFRAIN ABOUT THE HATRED OF LITERATURE I REFER YOU AGAIN TO THE PERVERSE CONSTITUTION OF MAN
3967-29012-0012 THE PRINCESS IS A MASSIVE LADY WITH THE ORGANISATION OF AN ATHLETE
3967-29012-0013 SHE CONTRIVES TO COMMIT HERSELF EXTRAORDINARILY LITTLE IN A GREAT MANY LANGUAGES AND IS ENTERTAINED AND CONVERSED WITH IN DETACHMENTS AND RELAYS LIKE AN INSTITUTION WHICH GOES ON FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION
3967-29012-0014 OR A BIG BUILDING CONTRACTED FOR UNDER A FORFEIT SHE CAN'T HAVE A PERSONAL TASTE ANY MORE THAN WHEN HER HUSBAND SUCCEEDS SHE CAN HAVE A PERSONAL CROWN AND HER OPINION ON ANY MATTER IS RUSTY AND HEAVY AND PLAIN
3967-29012-0015 MADE IN THE NIGHT OF AGES TO LAST AND BE TRANSMITTED
3967-29012-0016 SHE HAS BEEN TOLD EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD AND HAS NEVER PERCEIVED ANYTHING AND THE ECHOES OF HER EDUCATION RESPOND AWFULLY TO THE RASH FOOTFALL I MEAN THE CASUAL REMARK IN THE COLD VALHALLA OF HER MEMORY
3967-29012-0017 MISSUS WIMBUSH DELIGHTS IN HER WIT AND SAYS THERE'S NOTHING SO CHARMING AS TO HEAR MISTER PARADAY DRAW IT OUT HE'S PERPETUALLY DETAILED FOR THIS JOB AND HE TELLS ME IT HAS A PECULIARLY EXHAUSTING EFFECT
3967-29012-0018 EVERY ONE'S BEGINNING AT THE END OF TWO DAYS TO SIDLE OBSEQUIOUSLY AWAY FROM HER AND MISSUS WIMBUSH PUSHES HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN INTO THE BREACH NONE OF THE USES I HAVE YET SEEN HIM PUT TO
3967-29012-0019 INFURIATE ME QUITE SO MUCH HE LOOKS VERY FAGGED AND HAS AT LAST CONFESSED TO ME THAT HIS CONDITION MAKES HIM UNEASY HAS EVEN PROMISED ME HE'LL GO STRAIGHT HOME INSTEAD OF RETURNING TO HIS FINAL ENGAGEMENTS IN TOWN
3967-29012-0020 LAST NIGHT I HAD SOME TALK WITH HIM ABOUT GOING TO DAY CUTTING HIS VISIT SHORT SO SURE AM I THAT HE'LL BE BETTER AS SOON AS HE'S SHUT UP IN HIS LIGHTHOUSE HE TOLD ME THAT THIS IS WHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO DO
3967-29012-0021 REMINDING ME HOWEVER THAT THE FIRST LESSON OF HIS GREATNESS HAS BEEN PRECISELY THAT HE CAN'T DO WHAT HE LIKES MISSUS WIMBUSH WOULD NEVER FORGIVE HIM IF HE SHOULD LEAVE HER BEFORE THE PRINCESS HAS RECEIVED THE LAST HAND
3967-29012-0022 WHEN I HINT THAT A VIOLENT RUPTURE WITH OUR HOSTESS WOULD BE THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD FOR HIM HE GIVES ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF HIS REASON ASSENTS TO THE PROPOSITION HIS COURAGE HANGS WOEFULLY BACK
3967-29012-0023 HE MAKES NO SECRET OF BEING MORTALLY AFRAID OF HER AND WHEN I ASK WHAT HARM SHE CAN DO HIM THAT SHE HASN'T ALREADY DONE HE SIMPLY REPEATS I'M AFRAID I'M AFRAID DON'T ENQUIRE TOO CLOSELY HE SAID LAST NIGHT
3967-29012-0024 ONLY BELIEVE THAT I FEEL A SORT OF TERROR IT'S STRANGE WHEN SHE'S SO KIND
3967-29012-0025 AS TELL HER I MUST GO BEFORE MY DATE IT SOUNDS DREADFULLY WEAK BUT HE HAS SOME REASON AND HE PAYS FOR HIS IMAGINATION WHICH PUTS HIM I SHOULD HATE IT IN THE PLACE OF OTHERS AND MAKES HIM FEEL EVEN AGAINST HIMSELF
3967-29012-0026 THEIR FEELINGS THEIR APPETITES THEIR MOTIVES IT'S INDEED INVETERATELY AGAINST HIMSELF THAT HE MAKES HIS IMAGINATION ACT WHAT A PITY HE HAS SUCH A LOT OF IT HE'S TOO BEASTLY INTELLIGENT
3967-29012-0027 BESIDES THE FAMOUS READING'S STILL TO COME OFF AND IT HAS BEEN POSTPONED A DAY TO ALLOW GUY WALSINGHAM TO ARRIVE IT APPEARS THIS EMINENT LADY'S STAYING AT A HOUSE A FEW MILES OFF
3967-29012-0028 WHICH MEANS OF COURSE THAT MISSUS WIMBUSH HAS FORCIBLY ANNEXED HER SHE'S TO COME OVER IN A DAY OR TWO MISSUS WIMBUSH WANTS HER TO HEAR MISTER PARADAY TO DAY'S WET AND COLD AND SEVERAL OF THE COMPANY AT THE INVITATION OF THE DUKE
3967-29012-0029 HAVE DRIVEN OVER TO LUNCHEON AT BIGWOOD I SAW POOR PARADAY WEDGE HIMSELF BY COMMAND INTO THE LITTLE SUPPLEMENTARY SEAT OF A BROUGHAM IN WHICH THE PRINCESS AND OUR HOSTESS WERE ALREADY ENSCONCED
3967-29012-0030 IF THE FRONT GLASS ISN'T OPEN ON HIS DEAR OLD BACK PERHAPS HE'LL SURVIVE BIGWOOD I BELIEVE IS VERY GRAND AND FRIGID ALL MARBLE AND PRECEDENCE AND I WISH HIM WELL OUT OF THE ADVENTURE
3967-29012-0031 I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH MORE AND MORE YOUR ATTITUDE TO HIM IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS SHINES OUT BY CONTRAST I NEVER WILLINGLY TALK TO THESE PEOPLE ABOUT HIM BUT SEE WHAT A COMFORT I FIND IT TO SCRIBBLE TO YOU
3967-29012-0032 I APPRECIATE IT IT KEEPS ME WARM THERE ARE NO FIRES IN THE HOUSE MISSUS WIMBUSH GOES BY THE CALENDAR THE TEMPERATURE GOES BY THE WEATHER THE WEATHER GOES BY GOD KNOWS WHAT AND THE PRINCESS IS EASILY HEATED
3967-29012-0033 I'VE NOTHING BUT MY ACRIMONY TO WARM ME AND HAVE BEEN OUT UNDER AN UMBRELLA TO RESTORE MY CIRCULATION COMING IN AN HOUR AGO I FOUND LADY AUGUSTA MINCH RUMMAGING ABOUT THE HALL WHEN I ASKED HER WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING FOR
3967-29012-0034 SHE SAID SHE HAD MISLAID SOMETHING THAT MISTER PARADAY HAD LENT HER I ASCERTAINED IN A MOMENT THAT THE ARTICLE IN QUESTION IS A MANUSCRIPT AND I'VE A FOREBODING THAT IT'S THE NOBLE MORSEL HE READ ME SIX WEEKS AGO
3967-29012-0035 WHEN I EXPRESSED MY SURPRISE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BANDIED ABOUT ANYTHING SO PRECIOUS I HAPPEN TO KNOW IT'S HIS ONLY COPY IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HAND IN ALL THE WORLD LADY AUGUSTA CONFESSED TO ME THAT SHE HADN'T HAD IT FROM HIMSELF
3967-29012-0036 BUT FROM MISSUS WIMBUSH WHO HAD WISHED TO GIVE HER A GLIMPSE OF IT AS A SALVE FOR HER NOT BEING ABLE TO STAY AND HEAR IT READ IS THAT THE PIECE HE'S TO READ I ASKED WHEN GUY WALSINGHAM ARRIVES
3967-29012-0037 IT'S NOT FOR GUY WALSINGHAM THEY'RE WAITING NOW IT'S FOR DORA FORBES LADY AUGUSTA SAID SHE'S COMING I BELIEVE EARLY TO MORROW MEANWHILE MISSUS WIMBUSH HAS FOUND OUT ABOUT HIM AND IS ACTIVELY WIRING TO HIM SHE SAYS HE ALSO MUST HEAR HIM
3967-29012-0038 THE CLEAR THING IS THAT MISSUS WIMBUSH DOESN'T GUARD SUCH A TREASURE SO JEALOUSLY AS SHE MIGHT POOR DEAR SHE HAS THE PRINCESS TO GUARD MISTER PARADAY LENT HER THE MANUSCRIPT TO LOOK OVER
3967-29012-0039 SHE SPOKE YOU MEAN AS IF IT WERE THE MORNING PAPER LADY AUGUSTA STARED MY IRONY WAS LOST ON HER SHE DIDN'T HAVE TIME SO SHE GAVE ME A CHANCE FIRST BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY I GO TO MORROW TO BIGWOOD
3967-29012-0040 AND YOUR CHANCE HAS ONLY PROVED A CHANCE TO LOSE IT I HAVEN'T LOST IT I REMEMBER NOW IT WAS VERY STUPID OF ME TO HAVE FORGOTTEN I TOLD MY MAID TO GIVE IT TO LORD DORIMONT OR AT LEAST TO HIS MAN
3967-29012-0041 AND LORD DORIMONT WENT AWAY DIRECTLY AFTER LUNCHEON OF COURSE HE GAVE IT BACK TO MY MAID OR ELSE HIS MAN DID SAID LADY AUGUSTA I DARE SAY IT'S ALL RIGHT
3967-29012-0042 THE CONSCIENCE OF THESE PEOPLE IS LIKE A SUMMER SEA THEY HAVEN'T TIME TO LOOK OVER A PRICELESS COMPOSITION THEY'VE ONLY TIME TO KICK IT ABOUT THE HOUSE I SUGGESTED THAT THE MAN FIRED WITH A NOBLE EMULATION
3967-29012-0043 HAD PERHAPS KEPT THE WORK FOR HIS OWN PERUSAL AND HER LADYSHIP WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER IF THE THING SHOULDN'T REAPPEAR FOR THE GRAND OCCASION APPOINTED BY OUR HOSTESS THE AUTHOR WOULDN'T HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO READ THAT WOULD DO JUST AS WELL
3967-29012-0044 THEIR QUESTIONS ARE TOO DELIGHTFUL I DECLARED TO LADY AUGUSTA BRIEFLY THAT NOTHING IN THE WORLD CAN EVER DO SO WELL AS THE THING THAT DOES BEST AND AT THIS SHE LOOKED A LITTLE DISCONCERTED
3967-29012-0045 BUT I ADDED THAT IF THE MANUSCRIPT HAD GONE ASTRAY OUR LITTLE CIRCLE WOULD HAVE THE LESS OF AN EFFORT OF ATTENTION TO MAKE THE PIECE IN QUESTION WAS VERY LONG IT WOULD KEEP THEM THREE HOURS THREE HOURS
3967-29012-0046 OH THE PRINCESS WILL GET UP SAID LADY AUGUSTA I THOUGHT SHE WAS MISTER PARADAY'S GREATEST ADMIRER I DARE SAY SHE IS SHE'S SO AWFULLY CLEVER BUT WHAT'S THE USE OF BEING A PRINCESS
3967-29012-0047 IF YOU CAN'T DISSEMBLE YOUR LOVE I ASKED AS LADY AUGUSTA WAS VAGUE
