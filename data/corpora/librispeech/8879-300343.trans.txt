8879-300343-0000 STRANGE THAT THE SPANIARDS SHOULD LOOK ON COMPLAISANTLY WHILE ENGLISH TRADERS FROM CHINA MEARES AND HANNA AND BARKLEY AND DOUGLAS WERE TAKING POSSESSION OF NOOTKA THE ANSWER CAME UNEXPECTEDLY
8879-300343-0001 JUST AS THE BOSTONNAIS WERE SAILING OUT FOR A LAST RUN UP THE COAST THERE GLIDED INTO NOOTKA SOUND A PROUD SHIP ALL SAILS SET TWENTY CANNON POINTED SPANISH COLOURS SPREAD TO THE BREEZE
8879-300343-0002 THE CAPTAIN OF THIS VESSEL DON JOSEPH MARTINEZ TOOK A LOOK AT THE ENGLISH FORTIFICATIONS AND ANOTHER AT THE AMERICANS THE AMERICANS WERE ENEMIES OF ENGLAND THEREFORE THE POMPOUS DON TREATED THEM ROYALLY
8879-300343-0003 PRESENTED THEM WITH SPICES AND WINES AND ALLOWED THEM TO DEPART UNMOLESTED WHEN THE AMERICANS RETURNED FROM THE RUN UP COAST THEY FOUND THE ENGLISH FORT DISMANTLED A SPANISH FORT ERECTED ON HOG ISLAND AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE SOUND
8879-300343-0004 AND DOUGLAS'S SHIP THE COMPANION OF MEARES'S VESSEL HELD CAPTIVE BY THE SPANIARD GRAY AND KENDRICK NOW EXCHANGED SHIPS AND SAILED FOR CHINA TO DISPOSE OF THEIR CARGOES OF FURS AND RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE CARGOES OF TEA FOR BOSTON
8879-300343-0005 THE WHOLE CITY OF BOSTON WELCOMED THE COLUMBIA HOME IN THE AUTUMN OF SEVENTEEN NINETY
8879-300343-0006 IN JUNE SEVENTEEN NINETY ONE GRAY WAS OUT AGAIN ON THE COLUMBIA THIS TIME HE WENT AS FAR NORTH AS THE PORTLAND CANAL PAST THE QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS WHERE HE MET KENDRICK ON THE LADY WASHINGTON
8879-300343-0007 THE QUARREL AT NOOTKA BETWEEN THE ENGLISH AND THE SPANIARDS WAS STILL GOING ON SO THIS AUTUMN THE TWO BOSTONNAIS ANCHORED FOR THE WINTER
8879-300343-0008 A PLACE LATER TO BE MADE FAMOUS BY TRAGEDY SOUTH OF NOOTKA HERE THEY BUILT A STOCKADED FUR POST FOR THEMSELVES WHICH THEY NAMED FORT DEFENCE DURING THE WINTER THEY BUILT AND LAUNCHED A LITTLE COASTING SCHOONER THE ADVENTURE
8879-300343-0009 UP AT NOOTKA THE SPANIARD GONZALES DE HARO HAD REPLACED MARTINEZ AND HIS COUNTRYMEN QUIMPER AND ELISA WERE DAILY EXPLORING ON THE EAST SIDE OF VANCOUVER ISLAND
8879-300343-0010 AMID MUCH FIRING OF MUSKETS AND DRINKING OF WINE QUIMPER TOOK SOLEMN POSSESSION OF ALL THIS TERRITORY FOR SPAIN
8879-300343-0011 HE SAILED AWAY FOR MONTEREY WHILE ELISA REMAINED AT NOOTKA GRAY KNEW THAT THREE ENGLISH VESSELS WHICH HAD COME FROM CHINA FOR FURS COLNETT'S ARGONAUT DOUGLAS'S
8879-300343-0012 HAD BEEN SEIZED BY THE SPANISH AT NOOTKA THOUGH THE FACT HAD NOT BEEN TRUMPETED TO THE WORLD THE SPANISH SAID THAT THEIR PILOTS HAD EXPLORED THESE COASTS AS EARLY AS SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE AT LEAST THREE YEARS BEFORE COOK'S LANDING AT NOOTKA
8879-300343-0013 THE COLUMBIA HAD BEEN BEACHED AND DISMANTLED LOOP HOLES PUNCTURED THE PALISADES OF THE FORT AND CANNON WERE ABOVE THE GATES SENTINELS KEPT CONSTANT GUARD
8879-300343-0014 THE FORT COULD NOT BE DEFENDED AGAINST SUCH A NUMBER OF ENEMIES FOR THERE WERE NOT TWENTY MEN WITHIN THE WALLS GRAY HASTILY GOT THE COLUMBIA READY FOR SEA
8879-300343-0015 IF THE BOSTONNAIS WOULD GO ASHORE TO TRADE GRAY SLAPPED THE OLD RASCAL ACROSS THE FACE THE INDIAN WAS OVER THE SIDE AT A PLUNGE AND THE MARAUDERS WERE SEEN NO MORE IN SPITE OF THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS IT PRESENTED
8879-300343-0016 DISAPPOINTMENT IT WAS THE SPRING OF SEVENTEEN NINETY TWO THE SPANIARD ELISA OF NOOTKA HAD FOR A YEAR KEPT HIS PILOT NARVAEZ
8879-300343-0017 CHARTING NORTH EAST PAST THE HARBOUR OF VICTORIA THROUGH HARO STRAIT FOLLOWING VERY MUCH THE SAME CHANNEL THAT STEAMERS FOLLOW TO DAY AS THEY PLY BETWEEN VICTORIA AND VANCOUVER EAST OF A HIGH ISLAND
8879-300343-0018 WHERE HOLIDAY FOLK NOW HAVE THEIR SUMMER CAMPS PILOT NARVAEZ CAME ON THE ESTUARY OF A GREAT RIVER WHICH HE CALLED BOCA DE FLORIDA BLANCA
8879-300343-0019 IT WAS A NEW RIVER WITH WONDERFUL PURPLE WATER THE PURPLE OF RIVER SILT BLENDING WITH OCEAN BLUE THE BANKS WERE WOODED TO THE VERY WATER'S EDGE WITH HUGE GIRTHED AND MOSSED TREES
8879-300343-0020 SUCH AS WE TO DAY SEE IN STANLEY PARK VANCOUVER THE RIVER SWEPT DOWN BEHIND A DEEP HARBOUR WITH FORESTED HEIGHTS BETWEEN RIVER MOUTH AND ROADSTEAD
8879-300343-0021 AS IF NATURE HAD PURPOSELY INTERPOSED TO GUARD THIS HARBOUR AGAINST THE DEPOSIT OF SILT BORNE DOWN BY THE MIGHTY STREAM TO DAY A BOULEVARD RISES FROM THE LAND LOCKED HARBOUR AND GOES OVER THE HEIGHTS TO THE RIVER MOUTH LIKE THE ARC OF A BOW
8879-300343-0022 THE FINEST RESIDENCES OF THE CANADIAN PACIFIC COAST STAND THERE AND THE RIVER IS LINED WITH MILE UPON MILE OF LUMBER YARDS AND SAW MILLS
8879-300343-0023 HAD FOUND WHAT ARE NOW KNOWN AS BURRARD INLET VANCOUVER CITY POINT GREY SHAUGHNESSY HEIGHTS AND THE FRASER RIVER THE CREW WERE PRESENTLY ALL ILL OF SCURVY POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF THE UNSANITARY
8879-300343-0024 CROWDING AND THE SCHOONER ALMOST FALLING TO PIECES CAME CRAWLING BACK TO NOOTKA THE POOR MEXICANS WERE UTTERLY UNAWARE THAT THEY HAD DISCOVERED A GATEWAY FOR NORTHERN EMPIRE NARVAEZ HIMSELF LAY ALMOST UNCONSCIOUS IN HIS BERTH
8879-300343-0025 ELISA SENT THEM ALL HOME TO MEXICO ON FURLOUGH AND ON HEARING THEIR REPORT THE VICEROY OF MEXICO ORDERED OUT TWO SHIPS THE SUTIL AND THE MEXICANA DON GALIANO AND DON VALDES IN COMMAND TO FOLLOW UP THE CHARTING
8879-300343-0026 OF THE COAST NORTHWARD FROM VANCOUVER ISLAND TO THE RUSSIAN SETTLEMENTS SMALL RINGING OF BELLS NO BLARING OF TRUMPETS AT ALL PRAYERS A PLENTY BUT LITTLE AMMUNITION AND LESS FOOD
8879-300343-0027 WHEN BERING SET OUT HE HAD THE POWER OF THE WHOLE RUSSIAN EMPIRE BEHIND HIM
8879-300343-0028 BUT WHEN THE POOR MEXICAN PEONS SET OUT THEY HAD NOTHING BEHIND THEM BUT THE BRANDING IRON OR SLAVERY IN THE MINES IF THEY FAILED YET THEY SANG AS THEY SAILED THEIR RICKETY DEATH TRAPS AND THEY LAUGHED AS THEY ROWED AND WHEN THE TIDE RIP CAUGHT THEM
8879-300343-0029 THEY SANK WITHOUT A CRY TO ANY BUT THE VIRGIN LOOK AT A MAP OF THE WEST COAST OF THE PACIFIC FROM THE HORN TO SITKA FIRST WERE THE SPANIARDS AT EVERY HARBOUR GATE AND YET TO DAY OF ALL THEIR DEEP SEA FINDINGS ON THAT COAST
8879-300343-0030 BUT IF ACTUAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS COUNT THESE PILOTS WITH THEIR RAGGED PEON CREWS HALF BLOODS OF AZTEC WOMAN AND SPANISH ADVENTURER DESERVE HIGHER RANK IN THE ROLL OF PACIFIC COAST EXPLORATION
8879-300343-0031 THAN HISTORY HAS YET ACCORDED THEM ENGLAND IT MAY BE BELIEVED DID NOT CALMLY SUBMIT TO SEEING THE SHIPS AND FORTS OF HER TRADERS SEIZED AT NOOTKA IT WAS NOT THAT ENGLAND CARED FOR THE VALUE OF THREE VESSELS ENGAGED IN FOREIGN TRADE
8879-300343-0032 BUT SHE WAS MISTRESS OF THE SEAS AND HAD BEEN SINCE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ARMADA AND AS MISTRESS OF THE SEAS SHE COULD NOT TOLERATE AS MUCH AS THE SEIZURE OF A FISHING SMACK
8879-300343-0033 FOR SOME TIME THERE WERE MUTTERINGS OF WAR BUT AT LENGTH DIPLOMACY PREVAILED ENGLAND DEMANDED AMONG OTHER THINGS THE RESTORATION OF THE BUILDINGS AND THE LAND AND FULL REPARATION FOR ALL LOSSES
8879-300343-0034 SPAIN DECIDED TO SUBMIT AND ACCORDINGLY THE NOOTKA CONVENTION WAS SIGNED BY THE TWO POWERS IN OCTOBER SEVENTEEN NINETY TWO SHIPS THE DISCOVERY AND THE CHATHAM WERE THEN FITTED OUT BY THE BRITISH ADMIRALTY
8879-300343-0035 WHO HAD BEEN ON THE PACIFIC WITH COOK IT WAS APRIL SEVENTEEN NINETY TWO WHEN VANCOUVER CAME UP ABREAST OF CAPE DISAPPOINTMENT WAS IT CHANCE OR FATE
8879-300343-0036 AND ENGLAND MIGHT HAVE MADE GOOD HER CLAIM TO THE TERRITORY WHICH IS NOW OREGON AND WASHINGTON AND IDAHO VANCOUVER'S SHIPS WERE GLIDING INTO THE STRAIT OF JUAN DE FUCA
8879-300343-0037 WHEN THEY MET A SQUARE HULLED TRIM LITTLE TRADER UNDER THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES IT WAS THE COLUMBIA COMMANDED BY ROBERT GRAY THE AMERICAN TOLD AN ASTOUNDING STORY
8879-300343-0038 VANCOUVER REFUSED TO CREDIT THE NEWS YET THERE WAS THE SHIP'S LOG THERE WERE THE DETAILS LANDMARKS SOUNDINGS ANCHORAGES FOR TWENTY MILES UP THE COLUMBIA FROM ITS MOUTH GRAY HAD INDEED BEEN UP THE RIVER AND HAD CROSSED THE BAR
8879-300343-0039 AND COME OUT ON THE PACIFIC AGAIN VANCOUVER NOW HEADED HIS SHIPS INLAND AND PROCEEDED TO EXPLORE PUGET SOUND NEVER BEFORE HAD WHITE MEN'S BOATS CRUISED THE WATERS OF THAT SPIDER SHAPED SEA
8879-300343-0040 EVERY INLET OF THE TORTUOUS COASTS WAS PENETRATED AND SURVEYED TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT NO PASSAGE TO THE NORTH EAST LAY THROUGH THESE WATERS IN JUNE THE EXPLORERS PASSED UP THE STRAIT OF GEORGIA
8879-300343-0041 WHAT WOULD HAVE PROVED AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY THE MOUTH OF THE FRASER RIVER SOME DISTANCE NORTH OF BURRARD INLET
8879-300343-0042 WHICH THE VICEROY OF MEXICO HAD SENT OUT THE SUTIL AND THE MEXICANA COMMANDED RESPECTIVELY BY DON GALIANO AND DON VALDES FROM THEM VANCOUVER LEARNED THAT DON QUADRA THE SPANISH REPRESENTATIVE
8879-300343-0043 WAS AWAITING HIM AT NOOTKA PREPARED TO RESTORE THE FORTS AND PROPERTY
8879-300343-0044 THE SPANISH FRIGATES FAIRLY BRISTLED WITH CANNON AN ENGLISH OFFICER DRESSED IN REGIMENTALS MARCHED TO THE SPANISH FORT AND PRESENTED CAPTAIN VANCOUVER'S COMPLIMENTS TO DON QUADRA SPANISH CANNON THUNDERED A WELCOME THAT SHOOK THE HILLS
8879-300343-0045 AND ENGLISH GUNS MADE ANSWER A CURIOUS FASHION
8879-300343-0046 DON QUADRA BREAKFASTED CAPTAIN VANCOUVER
8879-300343-0047 AND MAQUINNA LORD OF THE WILDS ATTENDED THE FEAST DRESSED INDIAN FASHION BUT WHEN THE SPANISH DON AND THE ENGLISH OFFICER TOOK BREATH FROM FLOW OF COMPLIMENTS AND WINE THEY DID NOT SEEM TO ARRIVE ANYWHERE IN THEIR NEGOTIATIONS
8879-300343-0048 VANCOUVER HELD THAT SPAIN MUST RELINQUISH THE SITE OF MEARES'S FORT AND THE TERRITORY SURROUNDING IT AND PORT COX
8879-300343-0049 ACCORDING TO VANCOUVER BUT LITTLE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED YARDS IN EXTENT ANY WAY NO UNDERSTANDING COULD BE ARRIVED AT AND QUADRA AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER TOOK HIS DEPARTURE FOR MONTEREY LEAVING VANCOUVER TO FOLLOW A FEW DAYS LATER
8879-300343-0050 VANCOUVER WAS ANXIOUS TO BE OFF ON FURTHER EXPLORATION HE WAS EAGER TO VERIFY THE EXISTENCE OF THE RIVER WHICH GRAY HAD REPORTED HE SPENT MOST OF OCTOBER EXPLORING THIS RIVER EXPLORERS IN THAT DAY AS IN THIS
8879-300343-0051 WERE NOT FAIR JUDGES OF EACH OTHER'S FEATS VANCOUVER TOOK POSSESSION OF THE COLUMBIA RIVER REGION FOR ENGLAND SETTING DOWN IN HIS NARRATIVE
8879-300343-0052 HAD EVER ENTERED THIS RIVER BEFORE IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT MISTER GRAY EITHER SAW OR WAS EVER WITHIN FIVE LEAGUES OF THE ENTRANCE VANCOUVER THEN VISITED THE PRESIDIO AT SAN FRANCISCO AND THENCE PROCEEDED TO MONTEREY
8879-300343-0053 WHERE QUADRA AWAITED HIM HIS LIEUTENANT BROUGHTON WHO HAD BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE BOATS THAT EXPLORED THE COLUMBIA HERE LEFT HIM AND ACCOMPANIED QUADRA TO SAN BLAS WHENCE HE WENT OVERLAND TO THE ATLANTIC AND SAILED FOR ENGLAND BEARING DISPATCHES TO THE GOVERNMENT
8879-300343-0054 VANCOUVER SPENT YET ANOTHER YEAR ON THE NORTH PACIFIC CORROBORATING HIS FIRST YEAR'S CHARTING AND PROVING
