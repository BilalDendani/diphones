264-121332-0027 DO YOU KNOW IT RAN THAT YOUR THIRD COUSIN CLARA PAGE WIDOWED SIX MONTHS AND VERY POOR IS LIVING IN PHILADELPHIA I DON'T THINK YOU'VE EVER MET HER BUT I WISH AS A FAVOR TO ME YOU'D GO TO SEE HER
264-121332-0028 AMORY SIGHED AND DECIDED TO GO AS A FAVOR CLARA SHE WAS IMMEMORIAL
264-121332-0029 APART FROM THE DULL LITERATURE OF FEMALE VIRTUE SORROW LAY LIGHTLY AROUND HER AND WHEN AMORY FOUND HER IN PHILADELPHIA HE THOUGHT HER STEELY BLUE EYES HELD ONLY HAPPINESS A LATENT STRENGTH
264-121332-0030 A REALISM WAS BROUGHT TO ITS FULLEST DEVELOPMENT BY THE FACTS THAT SHE WAS COMPELLED TO FACE SHE WAS ALONE IN THE WORLD WITH TWO SMALL CHILDREN LITTLE MONEY AND WORST OF ALL A HOST OF FRIENDS
264-121332-0031 HE SAW HER THAT WINTER IN PHILADELPHIA ENTERTAINING A HOUSEFUL OF MEN FOR AN EVENING WHEN HE KNEW SHE HAD NOT A SERVANT IN THE HOUSE EXCEPT THE LITTLE COLORED GIRL GUARDING THE BABIES OVERHEAD HE SAW ONE OF THE GREATEST LIBERTINES IN THAT CITY
264-121332-0032 A MAN WHO WAS HABITUALLY DRUNK AND NOTORIOUS AT HOME AND ABROAD SITTING OPPOSITE HER FOR AN EVENING DISCUSSING GIRLS BOARDING SCHOOLS WITH A SORT OF INNOCENT EXCITEMENT
264-121332-0033 WHAT A TWIST CLARA HAD TO HER MIND SHE COULD MAKE FASCINATING AND ALMOST BRILLIANT CONVERSATION OUT OF THE THINNEST AIR THAT EVER FLOATED THROUGH A DRAWING ROOM
264-121332-0034 HE ARRIVED IN PHILADELPHIA EXPECTING TO BE TOLD THAT
264-121332-0035 WAS IN A MISERABLE LANE OF HOVELS
264-121332-0036 BEEN IN HER HUSBAND'S FAMILY FOR YEARS AN ELDERLY AUNT WHO OBJECTED TO HAVING IT SOLD HAD PUT TEN YEARS TAXES WITH A LAWYER AND PRANCED OFF TO HONOLULU LEAVING CLARA TO STRUGGLE WITH THE HEATING PROBLEM AS BEST SHE COULD
264-121332-0037 AND A SAD AMELIA LIKE LOOK GREETED HIM INSTEAD AMORY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT FROM HIS RECEPTION THAT SHE HAD NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD A CALM VIRILITY AND A DREAMY HUMOR
264-121332-0038 THOUGH SHE WAS WISE ENOUGH NEVER TO STULTIFY HERSELF WITH SUCH HOUSEHOLD ARTS AS KNITTING AND EMBROIDERY YET IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD PICK UP A BOOK AND LET HER IMAGINATION ROVE AS A FORMLESS CLOUD WITH THE WIND
264-121332-0039 DEEPEST OF ALL IN HER PERSONALITY WAS THE GOLDEN RADIANCE THAT SHE DIFFUSED AROUND HER
264-121332-0040 INTO THE QUIET FACES AT ITS EDGE SO SHE CAST HER LIGHTS AND SHADOWS AROUND THE ROOMS THAT HELD HER
264-121332-0041 QUAINT AND MEDITATIVE CHARM METAMORPHOSED THE STRAY TELEGRAPH BOY INTO A PUCK LIKE CREATURE OF DELIGHTFUL ORIGINALITY AT FIRST THIS QUALITY OF HERS SOMEHOW IRRITATED AMORY HE CONSIDERED HIS OWN UNIQUENESS SUFFICIENT AND IT
264-121332-0042 RATHER EMBARRASSED HIM WHEN SHE TRIED TO READ NEW INTERESTS INTO HIM FOR THE BENEFIT OF WHAT OTHER ADORERS WERE PRESENT HE FELT AS IF A POLITE BUT INSISTENT STAGE MANAGER WERE ATTEMPTING TO MAKE HIM GIVE A NEW INTERPRETATION OF A PART HE HAD CONNED FOR YEARS
264-121332-0043 BUT CLARA TALKING CLARA TELLING A SLENDER TALE OF A HATPIN AND AN INEBRIATED MAN AND HERSELF
264-121332-0044 BUT FOR THE LIFE OF THEM THEY COULD MAKE THEM SOUND LIKE NOTHING WHATEVER THEY GAVE HER A SORT OF INNOCENT ATTENTION AND THE BEST SMILES MANY OF THEM HAD SMILED FOR LONG THERE WERE FEW TEARS IN CLARA BUT PEOPLE SMILED MISTY EYED AT HER
264-121332-0045 VERY OCCASIONALLY AMORY STAYED FOR LITTLE HALF HOURS AFTER THE REST OF THE COURT HAD GONE AND THEY WOULD HAVE BREAD AND JAM AND TEA LATE IN THE AFTERNOON OR MAPLE SUGAR LUNCHES AS SHE CALLED THEM AT NIGHT
264-121332-0046 YOU ARE REMARKABLE AREN'T YOU
264-121332-0047 ONE SIX O'CLOCK NOT A BIT SHE ANSWERED
264-121332-0048 TELL THAT TO SOMEBODY ELSE SCOFFED AMORY YOU KNOW YOU'RE PERFECTLY EFFULGENT HE ASKED HER THE ONE THING THAT HE KNEW MIGHT EMBARRASS HER IT WAS THE REMARK
264-121332-0049 TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF AND SHE GAVE THE ANSWER THAT ADAM MUST HAVE GIVEN THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL BUT EVENTUALLY
264-121332-0050 ADAM PROBABLY TOLD THE BORE ALL THE THINGS HE THOUGHT ABOUT AT NIGHT WHEN THE LOCUSTS SANG IN THE SANDY GRASS AND HE MUST HAVE REMARKED PATRONIZINGLY
264-121332-0051 FORGETTING HOW DIFFERENT SHE WAS FROM HIM AT ANY RATE CLARA TOLD AMORY MUCH ABOUT HERSELF THAT EVENING SHE HAD HAD A HARRIED LIFE FROM SIXTEEN ON AND HER EDUCATION HAD STOPPED SHARPLY WITH HER LEISURE
264-121332-0052 BROWSING IN HER LIBRARY AMORY FOUND A TATTERED GRAY BOOK OUT OF WHICH FELL A YELLOW SHEET
264-121332-0053 GRAY CONVENT WALL ON A GRAY DAY AND A GIRL WITH HER CLOAK BLOWN BY THE WIND SITTING ATOP OF IT AND THINKING ABOUT THE MANY COLORED WORLD AS A RULE SUCH SENTIMENT BORED HIM
264-121332-0054 THAT IT BROUGHT A PICTURE OF CLARA TO HIS MIND OF CLARA ON SUCH A COOL GRAY DAY WITH HER KEEN BLUE EYES STARING OUT TRYING TO SEE HER TRAGEDIES COME MARCHING OVER THE GARDENS OUTSIDE HE ENVIED THAT POEM
264-121332-0055 AND TALKED NONSENSE OR ROMANCE TO HER
264-121332-0056 AND REST THEIR TIRED MINDS AS AT AN ABSORBING PLAY NOBODY SEEMS TO BORE YOU HE OBJECTED ABOUT HALF THE WORLD DO SHE ADMITTED
264-121332-0057 AND SHE TURNED TO FIND SOMETHING IN BROWNING THAT BORE ON THE SUBJECT
264-121332-0058 AND YET NOT BE IRRITATING TO DISTRACTION SHE DID IT CONSTANTLY WITH SUCH A SERIOUS ENTHUSIASM THAT HE GREW FOND OF WATCHING HER GOLDEN HAIR BENT OVER A BOOK BROW WRINKLED EVER SO LITTLE AT HUNTING HER SENTENCE
264-121332-0059 THROUGH EARLY MARCH HE TOOK TO GOING TO PHILADELPHIA FOR WEEK ENDS ALMOST ALWAYS THERE WAS SOME ONE ELSE THERE AND SHE SEEMED NOT ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM ALONE
264-121332-0060 ANOTHER DELICIOUS HALF HOUR OF ADORATION BUT HE FELL GRADUALLY IN LOVE AND BEGAN TO SPECULATE WILDLY ON MARRIAGE THOUGH THIS DESIGN FLOWED THROUGH HIS BRAIN EVEN TO HIS LIPS STILL HE KNEW AFTERWARD THAT THE DESIRE HAD NOT BEEN DEEPLY ROOTED
264-121332-0061 FOR IN HIS DREAM SHE HAD BEEN A SILLY FLAXEN CLARA
264-121332-0062 AND ONE OF THE FEW GOOD PEOPLE WHO EVER INTERESTED HIM SHE MADE HER GOODNESS SUCH AN ASSET AMORY HAD DECIDED THAT MOST GOOD PEOPLE EITHER DRAGGED THEIRS AFTER THEM AS A LIABILITY OR ELSE DISTORTED IT TO
264-121332-0063 ARTIFICIAL GENIALITY AND OF COURSE THERE WERE THE EVER PRESENT PRIG AND PHARISEE BUT AMORY NEVER INCLUDED THEM AS BEING AMONG THE SAVED SAINT CECILIA
264-121332-0064 OVER HER GRAY AND VELVET DRESS UNDER HER MOLTEN BEATEN HAIR COLOR OF ROSE IN MOCK DISTRESS FLUSHES AND FADES AND MAKES HER FAIR FILLS THE AIR FROM HER TO HIM
264-121332-0065 WITH LIGHT AND LANGUOR AND LITTLE SIGHS JUST SO SUBTLY HE SCARCELY KNOWS LAUGHING LIGHTNING COLOR OF ROSE DO YOU LIKE ME
264-121332-0066 WHY WELL WE HAVE SOME QUALITIES IN COMMON THINGS THAT ARE SPONTANEOUS IN EACH OF US OR WERE ORIGINALLY

264-121332-0079 CLARA DIDN'T GLOAT SHE CHANGED THE SUBJECT IMMEDIATELY BUT SHE HAD STARTED HIM THINKING AND HE BELIEVED SHE WAS PARTLY RIGHT HE FELT LIKE A FACTORY OWNER WHO AFTER ACCUSING A CLERK OF DISHONESTY
264-121332-0080 HIS POOR MISTREATED WILL THAT HE HAD BEEN HOLDING UP TO THE SCORN OF HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS STOOD BEFORE HIM INNOCENT AND HIS JUDGMENT WALKED OFF TO PRISON WITH THE UNCONFINABLE IMP IMAGINATION
264-121332-0081 DANCING IN MOCKING GLEE BESIDE HIM CLARA'S WAS THE ONLY ADVICE HE EVER ASKED WITHOUT DICTATING THE ANSWER HIMSELF EXCEPT PERHAPS IN HIS TALKS WITH MONSIGNOR DARCY
264-121332-0082 HOW HE LOVED TO DO ANY SORT OF THING WITH CLARA SHOPPING WITH HER WAS A RARE EPICUREAN DREAM IN EVERY STORE WHERE SHE HAD EVER TRADED SHE WAS WHISPERED ABOUT AS THE BEAUTIFUL MISSUS PAGE

264-121332-0086 SHE WAS VERY DEVOUT ALWAYS HAD BEEN AND GOD KNOWS WHAT HEIGHTS SHE ATTAINED AND WHAT STRENGTH SHE DREW DOWN TO HERSELF WHEN SHE KNELT AND BENT HER GOLDEN HAIR INTO THE STAINED GLASS LIGHT
264-121332-0087 QUITE INVOLUNTARILY AND THE PEOPLE TURNED AND PEERED AND THE PRIEST PAUSED IN HIS SERMON AND CLARA AND AMORY TURNED TO FIERY RED THAT WAS THE LAST SUNDAY THEY HAD FOR HE SPOILED IT ALL THAT NIGHT

264-121332-0097 DON'T MAKE ME OUT SUCH A LIGHT WEIGHT CLARA YOU ARE DEPRESSING SOMETIMES YOU'RE NOT A LIGHT WEIGHT OF ALL THINGS SHE SAID INTENTLY TAKING HIS ARM AND OPENING WIDE HER EYES

264-121332-0106 OFTEN AMORY MET WIVES WHOM HE HAD KNOWN AS DEBUTANTES AND LOOKING INTENTLY AT THEM IMAGINED THAT HE FOUND SOMETHING IN THEIR FACES WHICH SAID OH IF I COULD ONLY HAVE GOTTEN YOU OH THE ENORMOUS CONCEIT OF THE MAN
264-121332-0107 BUT THAT NIGHT SEEMED A NIGHT OF STARS AND SINGING AND CLARA'S BRIGHT SOUL STILL GLEAMED ON THE WAYS THEY HAD TROD GOLDEN GOLDEN IS THE AIR HE CHANTED TO THE LITTLE POOLS OF WATER
264-121332-0108 GOLDEN IS THE AIR GOLDEN NOTES FROM GOLDEN MANDOLINS GOLDEN FRETS OF GOLDEN VIOLINS FAIR OH WEARILY FAIR SKEINS FROM BRAIDED BASKET MORTALS MAY NOT HOLD
