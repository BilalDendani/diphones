1733-139046-0000 TABOOS ON INTERCOURSE WITH STRANGERS SO MUCH FOR THE PRIMITIVE CONCEPTIONS OF THE SOUL AND THE DANGERS TO WHICH IT IS EXPOSED THESE CONCEPTIONS ARE NOT LIMITED TO ONE PEOPLE OR COUNTRY
1733-139046-0001 WITH VARIATIONS OF DETAIL THEY ARE FOUND ALL OVER THE WORLD AND SURVIVE AS WE HAVE SEEN IN MODERN EUROPE
1733-139046-0002 FOR IF EVERY PERSON WAS AT SUCH PAINS TO SAVE HIS OWN SOUL FROM THE PERILS WHICH THREATENED IT ON SO MANY SIDES HOW MUCH MORE CAREFULLY MUST HE HAVE BEEN GUARDED
1733-139046-0003 UPON WHOSE LIFE HUNG THE WELFARE AND EVEN THE EXISTENCE OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE AND WHOM THEREFORE IT WAS THE COMMON INTEREST OF ALL TO PRESERVE THEREFORE
1733-139046-0004 THAN THOSE WHICH IN PRIMITIVE SOCIETY EVERY MAN ADOPTS FOR THE SAFETY OF HIS OWN SOUL NOW
1733-139046-0005 BY A VERY EXACT CODE OF RULES MAY WE NOT THEN CONJECTURE THAT THESE RULES ARE IN FACT THE VERY SAFEGUARDS WHICH WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND ADOPTED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE KING'S LIFE
1733-139046-0006 AN EXAMINATION OF THE RULES THEMSELVES CONFIRMS THIS CONJECTURE FOR FROM THIS IT APPEARS THAT SOME OF THE RULES OBSERVED BY THE KINGS ARE IDENTICAL WITH THOSE OBSERVED BY PRIVATE PERSONS OUT OF REGARD FOR THE SAFETY OF THEIR SOULS
1733-139046-0007 MANY IF NOT ALL ARE MOST READILY EXPLAINED ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THEY ARE NOTHING BUT SAFEGUARDS OR LIFEGUARDS OF THE KING I WILL NOW ENUMERATE SOME OF THESE ROYAL RULES OR TABOOS
1733-139046-0008 OFFERING ON EACH OF THEM SUCH COMMENTS AND EXPLANATIONS AS MAY SERVE TO SET THE ORIGINAL INTENTION OF THE RULE IN ITS PROPER LIGHT AS THE OBJECT OF THE ROYAL TABOOS IS TO ISOLATE THE KING FROM ALL SOURCES OF DANGER
1733-139046-0009 THEIR GENERAL EFFECT IS TO COMPEL HIM TO LIVE IN A STATE OF SECLUSION MORE OR LESS COMPLETE ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER AND STRINGENCY OF THE RULES HE OBSERVES NOW OF ALL SOURCES OF DANGER NONE ARE MORE DREADED BY THE SAVAGE THAN MAGIC AND WITCHCRAFT
1733-139046-0010 AND HE SUSPECTS ALL STRANGERS OF PRACTISING THESE BLACK ARTS TO GUARD AGAINST THE BANEFUL INFLUENCE EXERTED VOLUNTARILY OR INVOLUNTARILY BY STRANGERS IS THEREFORE AN ELEMENTARY DICTATE OF SAVAGE PRUDENCE
1733-139046-0011 HENCE BEFORE STRANGERS ARE ALLOWED TO ENTER A DISTRICT OR AT LEAST BEFORE THEY ARE PERMITTED TO MINGLE FREELY WITH THE INHABITANTS
1733-139046-0012 OF COUNTERACTING THE BANEFUL INFLUENCE WHICH IS BELIEVED TO EMANATE FROM THEM OR OF DISINFECTING SO TO SPEAK THE TAINTED ATMOSPHERE BY WHICH THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SURROUNDED
1733-139046-0013 TO CONCLUDE A PEACE WITH THE TURKS HAD REACHED THEIR DESTINATION THEY WERE RECEIVED BY SHAMANS WHO SUBJECTED THEM TO A CEREMONIAL PURIFICATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXORCISING ALL HARMFUL INFLUENCE
1733-139046-0014 HAVING DEPOSITED THE GOODS BROUGHT BY THE AMBASSADORS IN AN OPEN PLACE THESE WIZARDS CARRIED BURNING BRANCHES OF INCENSE ROUND THEM WHILE THEY RANG A BELL AND BEAT ON A TAMBOURINE
1733-139046-0015 SNORTING AND FALLING INTO A STATE OF FRENZY IN THEIR EFFORTS TO DISPEL THE POWERS OF EVIL
1733-139046-0016 SOUTH PACIFIC STRANGERS FROM SHIPS OR FROM OTHER ISLANDS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE PEOPLE UNTIL THEY ALL OR A FEW AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE REST HAD BEEN TAKEN TO EACH OF THE FOUR TEMPLES IN THE ISLAND
1733-139046-0017 AND PRAYERS OFFERED THAT THE GOD WOULD AVERT ANY DISEASE OR TREACHERY WHICH THESE STRANGERS MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT WITH THEM MEAT OFFERINGS WERE ALSO LAID UPON THE ALTARS ACCOMPANIED BY SONGS AND DANCES IN HONOUR OF THE GOD
1733-139046-0018 WHILE THESE CEREMONIES WERE GOING ON ALL THE PEOPLE EXCEPT THE PRIESTS AND THEIR ATTENDANTS KEPT OUT OF SIGHT AMONGST THE OT DANOMS OF BORNEO IT IS THE CUSTOM THAT STRANGERS ENTERING THE TERRITORY SHOULD PAY TO THE NATIVES A CERTAIN SUM
1733-139046-0019 IN ORDER TO RECONCILE THEM TO THE PRESENCE OF THE STRANGERS
1733-139046-0020 FEARING TO LOOK UPON A EUROPEAN TRAVELLER LEST HE SHOULD MAKE THEM ILL WARNED THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN NOT TO GO NEAR HIM THOSE WHO COULD NOT RESTRAIN THEIR CURIOSITY KILLED FOWLS TO APPEASE THE EVIL SPIRITS AND SMEARED THEMSELVES WITH THE BLOOD MORE DREADED
1733-139046-0021 SAYS A TRAVELLER IN CENTRAL BORNEO THAN THE EVIL SPIRITS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ARE THE EVIL SPIRITS FROM A DISTANCE WHICH ACCOMPANY TRAVELLERS
1733-139046-0022 A FEW MOMENTS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL SOME OF THE INDIANS BROUGHT HIM A NUMBER OF LARGE BLACK ANTS OF A SPECIES WHOSE BITE IS PAINFUL FASTENED ON PALM LEAVES
1733-139046-0023 THEN ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE VILLAGE WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF AGE OR SEX PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO HIM AND HE HAD TO STING THEM ALL WITH THE ANTS ON THEIR FACES THIGHS AND OTHER PARTS OF THEIR BODIES SOMETIMES WHEN HE APPLIED THE ANTS TOO TENDERLY
1733-139046-0024 THEY CALLED OUT MORE MORE AND WERE NOT SATISFIED TILL THEIR SKIN WAS THICKLY STUDDED WITH TINY SWELLINGS LIKE WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY WHIPPING THEM WITH NETTLES
1733-139046-0025 THE OBJECT OF THIS CEREMONY IS MADE PLAIN BY THE CUSTOM OBSERVED IN AMBOYNA AND ULIASE OF SPRINKLING SICK PEOPLE WITH PUNGENT SPICES SUCH AS GINGER AND CLOVES CHEWED FINE IN ORDER BY THE PRICKLING SENSATION
1733-139046-0026 TO DRIVE AWAY THE DEMON OF DISEASE WHICH MAY BE CLINGING TO THEIR PERSONS IN JAVA A POPULAR CURE FOR GOUT OR RHEUMATISM IS TO RUB SPANISH PEPPER INTO THE NAILS OF THE FINGERS AND TOES OF THE SUFFERER
1733-139046-0027 THE PUNGENCY OF THE PEPPER IS SUPPOSED TO BE TOO MUCH FOR THE GOUT OR RHEUMATISM WHO ACCORDINGLY DEPARTS IN HASTE SO ON THE SLAVE COAST THE MOTHER OF A SICK CHILD SOMETIMES BELIEVES THAT AN EVIL SPIRIT HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE CHILD'S BODY
1733-139046-0028 AND IN ORDER TO DRIVE HIM OUT SHE MAKES SMALL CUTS IN THE BODY OF THE LITTLE SUFFERER AND INSERTS GREEN PEPPERS OR SPICES IN THE WOUNDS BELIEVING THAT SHE WILL THEREBY HURT THE EVIL SPIRIT AND FORCE HIM TO BE GONE
1733-139046-0029 THE POOR CHILD NATURALLY SCREAMS WITH PAIN BUT THE MOTHER HARDENS HER HEART IN THE BELIEF THAT THE DEMON IS SUFFERING EQUALLY IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE SAME DREAD OF STRANGERS RATHER THAN ANY DESIRE TO DO THEM HONOUR
1733-139046-0030 IS THE MOTIVE OF CERTAIN CEREMONIES WHICH ARE SOMETIMES OBSERVED AT THEIR RECEPTION BUT OF WHICH THE INTENTION IS NOT DIRECTLY STATED IN THE ONGTONG JAVA ISLANDS WHICH ARE INHABITED BY POLYNESIANS
1733-139046-0031 THE PRIESTS OR SORCERERS SEEM TO WIELD GREAT INFLUENCE THEIR MAIN BUSINESS IS TO SUMMON OR EXORCISE SPIRITS FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVERTING OR DISPELLING SICKNESS AND OF PROCURING FAVOURABLE WINDS A GOOD CATCH OF FISH AND SO ON
1733-139046-0032 WHEN STRANGERS LAND ON THE ISLANDS THEY ARE FIRST OF ALL RECEIVED BY THE SORCERERS
1733-139046-0033 AND THE NEWCOMER AND HIS BOAT ARE WIPED WITH GREEN LEAVES AFTER THIS CEREMONY THE STRANGERS ARE INTRODUCED BY THE SORCERERS TO THE CHIEF IN AFGHANISTAN AND IN SOME PARTS OF PERSIA
1733-139046-0034 THE TRAVELLER BEFORE HE ENTERS A VILLAGE IS FREQUENTLY RECEIVED WITH A SACRIFICE OF ANIMAL LIFE OR FOOD OR OF FIRE AND INCENSE THE AFGHAN BOUNDARY MISSION IN PASSING BY VILLAGES IN AFGHANISTAN WAS OFTEN MET WITH FIRE AND INCENSE
1733-139046-0035 SOMETIMES A TRAY OF LIGHTED EMBERS IS THROWN UNDER THE HOOFS OF THE TRAVELLER'S HORSE WITH THE WORDS YOU ARE WELCOME ON ENTERING A VILLAGE IN CENTRAL AFRICA EMIN PASHA WAS RECEIVED WITH THE SACRIFICE OF TWO GOATS
1733-139046-0036 THEIR BLOOD WAS SPRINKLED ON THE PATH AND THE CHIEF STEPPED OVER THE BLOOD TO GREET EMIN SOMETIMES THE DREAD OF STRANGERS AND THEIR MAGIC IS TOO GREAT TO ALLOW OF THEIR RECEPTION ON ANY TERMS
1733-139046-0037 BECAUSE THEY HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN A WHITE MAN NOR THE TIN BOXES THAT THE MEN WERE CARRYING WHO KNOWS THEY SAID BUT THAT THESE VERY BOXES ARE THE PLUNDERING WATUTA TRANSFORMED AND COME TO KILL US YOU CANNOT BE ADMITTED
1733-139046-0038 NO PERSUASION COULD AVAIL WITH THEM AND THE PARTY HAD TO PROCEED TO THE NEXT VILLAGE THE FEAR THUS ENTERTAINED OF ALIEN VISITORS IS OFTEN MUTUAL ENTERING A STRANGE LAND THE SAVAGE FEELS THAT HE IS TREADING ENCHANTED GROUND
1733-139046-0039 AND HE TAKES STEPS TO GUARD AGAINST THE DEMONS THAT HAUNT IT AND THE MAGICAL ARTS OF ITS INHABITANTS THUS ON GOING TO A STRANGE LAND THE MAORIS PERFORMED CERTAIN CEREMONIES TO MAKE IT COMMON
1733-139046-0040 WAS APPROACHING A VILLAGE ON THE MACLAY COAST OF NEW GUINEA ONE OF THE NATIVES WHO ACCOMPANIED HIM BROKE A BRANCH FROM A TREE AND GOING ASIDE WHISPERED TO IT FOR A WHILE THEN STEPPING UP TO EACH MEMBER OF THE PARTY ONE AFTER ANOTHER
1733-139046-0041 HE SPAT SOMETHING UPON HIS BACK AND GAVE HIM SOME BLOWS WITH THE BRANCH LASTLY HE WENT INTO THE FOREST AND BURIED THE BRANCH UNDER WITHERED LEAVES IN THE THICKEST PART OF THE JUNGLE
1733-139046-0042 THE IDEA PROBABLY WAS THAT THE MALIGNANT INFLUENCES WERE DRAWN OFF FROM THE PERSONS INTO THE BRANCH AND BURIED WITH IT IN THE DEPTHS OF THE FOREST IN AUSTRALIA WHEN A STRANGE TRIBE HAS BEEN INVITED INTO A DISTRICT
1733-139046-0043 AND IS APPROACHING THE ENCAMPMENT OF THE TRIBE WHICH OWNS THE LAND THE STRANGERS CARRY LIGHTED BARK OR BURNING STICKS IN THEIR HANDS FOR THE PURPOSE THEY SAY OF CLEARING AND PURIFYING THE AIR WHEN THE TORADJAS ARE ON A HEAD HUNTING EXPEDITION
1733-139046-0044 AND HAVE ENTERED THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY THEY MAY NOT EAT ANY FRUITS WHICH THE FOE HAS PLANTED NOR ANY ANIMAL WHICH HE HAS REARED UNTIL THEY HAVE FIRST COMMITTED AN ACT OF HOSTILITY AS BY BURNING A HOUSE OR KILLING A MAN
1733-139046-0045 WHICH WOULD DESTROY THE MYSTIC VIRTUE OF THEIR TALISMANS
1733-139046-0046 LEST THEY SHOULD HAVE CONTRACTED FROM STRANGERS SOME EVIL BY WITCHCRAFT OR SORCERY IN SOME PARTS OF WESTERN AFRICA WHEN A MAN RETURNS HOME AFTER A LONG ABSENCE BEFORE HE IS ALLOWED TO VISIT HIS WIFE HE MUST WASH HIS PERSON WITH A PARTICULAR FLUID
1733-139046-0047 AND RECEIVE FROM THE SORCERER A CERTAIN MARK ON HIS FOREHEAD IN ORDER TO COUNTERACT ANY MAGIC SPELL WHICH A STRANGER WOMAN MAY HAVE CAST ON HIM IN HIS ABSENCE AND WHICH MIGHT BE COMMUNICATED THROUGH HIM TO THE WOMEN OF HIS VILLAGE
1733-139046-0048 AND HAD RETURNED TO INDIA WERE CONSIDERED TO HAVE SO POLLUTED THEMSELVES BY CONTACT WITH STRANGERS THAT NOTHING BUT BEING BORN AGAIN COULD RESTORE THEM TO PURITY
1733-139046-0049 IN THE SHAPE EITHER OF A WOMAN OR OF A COW IN THIS STATUE THE PERSON TO BE REGENERATED IS ENCLOSED AND DRAGGED THROUGH THE USUAL CHANNEL AS A STATUE OF PURE GOLD AND OF PROPER DIMENSIONS WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE
1733-139046-0050 IT IS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE AN IMAGE OF THE SACRED YONI THROUGH WHICH THE PERSON TO BE REGENERATED IS TO PASS SUCH AN IMAGE OF PURE GOLD WAS MADE AT THE PRINCE'S COMMAND AND HIS AMBASSADORS WERE BORN AGAIN BY BEING DRAGGED THROUGH IT
1733-139046-0051 IT IS NO WONDER THAT SPECIAL MEASURES ARE ADOPTED TO PROTECT THE KING FROM THE SAME INSIDIOUS DANGER IN THE MIDDLE AGES THE ENVOYS WHO VISITED A TARTAR KHAN WERE OBLIGED TO PASS BETWEEN TWO FIRES BEFORE THEY WERE ADMITTED TO HIS PRESENCE
1733-139046-0052 AND THE GIFTS THEY BROUGHT WERE ALSO CARRIED BETWEEN THE FIRES THE REASON ASSIGNED FOR THE CUSTOM WAS THAT THE FIRE PURGED AWAY ANY MAGIC INFLUENCE WHICH THE STRANGERS MIGHT MEAN TO EXERCISE OVER THE KHAN
1733-139046-0053 WHEN SUBJECT CHIEFS COME WITH THEIR RETINUES TO VISIT KALAMBA THE MOST POWERFUL CHIEF OF THE BASHILANGE IN THE CONGO BASIN FOR THE FIRST TIME OR AFTER BEING REBELLIOUS THEY HAVE TO BATHE MEN AND WOMEN TOGETHER
1733-139046-0054 IN TWO BROOKS ON TWO SUCCESSIVE DAYS PASSING THE NIGHTS UNDER THE OPEN SKY IN THE MARKET PLACE AFTER THE SECOND BATH THEY PROCEED ENTIRELY NAKED TO THE HOUSE OF KALAMBA WHO MAKES A LONG WHITE MARK ON THE BREAST AND FOREHEAD OF EACH OF THEM
1733-139046-0055 THEN THEY RETURN TO THE MARKET PLACE AND DRESS AFTER WHICH THEY UNDERGO THE PEPPER ORDEAL PEPPER IS DROPPED INTO THE EYES OF EACH OF THEM AND WHILE THIS IS BEING DONE THE SUFFERER HAS TO MAKE A CONFESSION OF ALL HIS SINS TO ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS
1733-139046-0056 TWO TABOOS ON EATING AND DRINKING IN THE OPINION OF SAVAGES THE ACTS OF EATING AND DRINKING ARE ATTENDED WITH SPECIAL DANGER FOR AT THESE TIMES THE SOUL MAY ESCAPE FROM THE MOUTH
1733-139046-0057 OR BE EXTRACTED BY THE MAGIC ARTS OF AN ENEMY PRESENT AMONG THE EWE SPEAKING PEOPLES OF THE SLAVE COAST THE COMMON BELIEF SEEMS TO BE THAT THE INDWELLING SPIRIT LEAVES THE BODY AND RETURNS TO IT THROUGH THE MOUTH
1733-139046-0058 HENCE SHOULD IT HAVE GONE OUT IT BEHOVES A MAN TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT OPENING HIS MOUTH LEST A HOMELESS SPIRIT SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY AND ENTER HIS BODY THIS IT APPEARS
1733-139046-0059 IS CONSIDERED MOST LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE WHILE THE MAN IS EATING PRECAUTIONS ARE THEREFORE ADOPTED TO GUARD AGAINST THESE DANGERS
1733-139046-0060 BUT IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE TO PREVENT THE SOUL FROM STRAYING WHEN ONE IS IN THE HOUSE AT FEASTS ONE MAY FIND THE WHOLE HOUSE SHUT UP IN ORDER THAT THE SOUL MAY STAY AND ENJOY THE GOOD THINGS SET BEFORE IT
1733-139046-0061 THE ZAFIMANELO IN MADAGASCAR LOCK THEIR DOORS WHEN THEY EAT AND HARDLY ANY ONE EVER SEES THEM EATING THE WARUA
1733-139046-0062 BEING DOUBLY PARTICULAR THAT NO PERSON OF THE OPPOSITE SEX SHALL SEE THEM DOING SO I HAD TO PAY A MAN TO LET ME SEE HIM DRINK I COULD NOT MAKE A MAN LET A WOMAN SEE HIM DRINK
1733-139046-0063 IF THESE ARE THE ORDINARY PRECAUTIONS TAKEN BY COMMON PEOPLE THE PRECAUTIONS TAKEN BY KINGS ARE EXTRAORDINARY
1733-139046-0064 THE KING OF LOANGO MAY NOT BE SEEN EATING OR DRINKING BY MAN OR BEAST UNDER PAIN OF DEATH A FAVOURITE DOG HAVING BROKEN INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE KING WAS DINING THE KING ORDERED IT TO BE KILLED ON THE SPOT
1733-139046-0065 ONCE THE KING'S OWN SON A BOY OF TWELVE YEARS OLD INADVERTENTLY SAW THE KING DRINK IMMEDIATELY THE KING ORDERED HIM TO BE FINELY APPARELLED AND FEASTED
1733-139046-0066 AFTER WHICH HE COMMANDED HIM TO BE CUT IN QUARTERS AND CARRIED ABOUT THE CITY WITH A PROCLAMATION THAT HE HAD SEEN THE KING DRINK WHEN THE KING HAS A MIND TO DRINK HE HAS A CUP OF WINE BROUGHT
1733-139046-0067 ON WHICH ALL PRESENT FALL DOWN WITH THEIR FACES TO THE GROUND AND CONTINUE SO TILL THE KING HAS DRANK HIS EATING IS MUCH IN THE SAME STYLE FOR WHICH HE HAS A HOUSE ON PURPOSE WHERE HIS VICTUALS ARE SET UPON A BENSA OR TABLE
1733-139046-0068 WHICH HE GOES TO AND SHUTS THE DOOR WHEN HE HAS DONE HE KNOCKS AND COMES OUT SO THAT NONE EVER SEE THE KING EAT OR DRINK FOR IT IS BELIEVED THAT IF ANY ONE SHOULD THE KING SHALL IMMEDIATELY DIE
1733-139046-0069 THE REMNANTS OF HIS FOOD ARE BURIED DOUBTLESS TO PREVENT THEM FROM FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF SORCERERS WHO BY MEANS OF THESE FRAGMENTS MIGHT CAST A FATAL SPELL OVER THE MONARCH THE RULES OBSERVED BY THE NEIGHBOURING KING OF CACONGO WERE SIMILAR
1733-139046-0070 IT IS A CAPITAL OFFENCE TO SEE THE KING OF DAHOMEY AT HIS MEALS WHEN HE DRINKS IN PUBLIC AS HE DOES ON EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS HE HIDES HIMSELF BEHIND A CURTAIN OR HANDKERCHIEFS ARE HELD UP ROUND HIS HEAD
1733-139046-0071 IN CENTRAL AFRICA WENT TO DRINK MILK IN THE DAIRY EVERY MAN MUST LEAVE THE ROYAL ENCLOSURE AND ALL THE WOMEN HAD TO COVER THEIR HEADS TILL THE KING RETURNED NO ONE MIGHT SEE HIM DRINK
1733-139046-0072 ONE WIFE ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE DAIRY AND HANDED HIM THE MILK POT BUT SHE TURNED AWAY HER FACE WHILE HE DRAINED IT THREE TABOOS ON SHOWING THE FACE
1733-139046-0073 IN SOME OF THE PRECEDING CASES THE INTENTION OF EATING AND DRINKING IN STRICT SECLUSION MAY PERHAPS BE TO HINDER EVIL INFLUENCES FROM ENTERING THE BODY
1733-139046-0074 THIS CERTAINLY IS THE MOTIVE OF SOME DRINKING CUSTOMS OBSERVED BY NATIVES OF THE CONGO REGION THUS WE ARE TOLD OF THESE PEOPLE THAT
1733-139046-0075 ONE OF THEM RINGS A BELL ALL THE TIME HE IS DRINKING ANOTHER CROUCHES DOWN AND PLACES HIS LEFT HAND ON THE EARTH ANOTHER VEILS HIS HEAD ANOTHER PUTS A STALK OF GRASS OR A LEAF IN HIS HAIR OR MARKS HIS FOREHEAD WITH A LINE OF CLAY
1733-139046-0076 THIS FETISH CUSTOM ASSUMES VERY VARIED FORMS TO EXPLAIN THEM THE BLACK IS SATISFIED TO SAY THAT THEY ARE AN ENERGETIC MODE OF CONJURING SPIRITS
1733-139046-0077 IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD A CHIEF WILL COMMONLY RING A BELL AT EACH DRAUGHT OF BEER WHICH HE SWALLOWS AND AT THE SAME MOMENT A LAD STATIONED IN FRONT OF HIM BRANDISHES A SPEAR
1733-139046-0078 TO KEEP AT BAY THE SPIRITS WHICH MIGHT TRY TO SNEAK INTO THE OLD CHIEF'S BODY BY THE SAME ROAD AS THE BEER THE SAME MOTIVE OF WARDING OFF EVIL SPIRITS PROBABLY EXPLAINS THE CUSTOM OBSERVED BY SOME AFRICAN SULTANS OF VEILING THEIR FACES
1733-139046-0079 THE SULTAN OF DARFUR WRAPS UP HIS FACE WITH A PIECE OF WHITE MUSLIN WHICH GOES ROUND HIS HEAD SEVERAL TIMES COVERING HIS MOUTH AND NOSE FIRST
1733-139046-0080 IS SAID TO BE OBSERVED IN OTHER PARTS OF CENTRAL AFRICA THE SULTAN OF WADAI ALWAYS SPEAKS FROM BEHIND A CURTAIN NO ONE SEES HIS FACE EXCEPT HIS INTIMATES AND A FEW FAVOURED PERSONS FOUR
1733-139046-0081 TABOOS ON QUITTING THE HOUSE BY AN EXTENSION OF THE LIKE PRECAUTION KINGS ARE SOMETIMES FORBIDDEN EVER TO LEAVE THEIR PALACES OR IF THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO SO THEIR SUBJECTS ARE FORBIDDEN TO SEE THEM ABROAD
1733-139046-0082 THE FETISH KING OF BENIN WHO WAS WORSHIPPED AS A DEITY BY HIS SUBJECTS MIGHT NOT QUIT HIS PALACE AFTER HIS CORONATION THE KING OF LOANGO IS CONFINED TO HIS PALACE WHICH HE MAY NOT LEAVE THE KING OF ONITSHA
1733-139046-0083 DOES NOT STEP OUT OF HIS HOUSE INTO THE TOWN UNLESS A HUMAN SACRIFICE IS MADE TO PROPITIATE THE GODS ON THIS ACCOUNT HE NEVER GOES OUT BEYOND THE PRECINCTS OF HIS PREMISES
1733-139046-0084 INDEED WE ARE TOLD THAT HE MAY NOT QUIT HIS PALACE UNDER PAIN OF DEATH OR OF GIVING UP ONE OR MORE SLAVES TO BE EXECUTED IN HIS PRESENCE AS THE WEALTH OF THE COUNTRY IS MEASURED IN SLAVES
1733-139046-0085 THE KING TAKES GOOD CARE NOT TO INFRINGE THE LAW YET ONCE A YEAR AT THE FEAST OF YAMS THE KING IS ALLOWED AND EVEN REQUIRED BY CUSTOM TO DANCE BEFORE HIS PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE HIGH MUD WALL OF THE PALACE IN DANCING HE CARRIES A GREAT WEIGHT
1733-139046-0086 GENERALLY A SACK OF EARTH ON HIS BACK TO PROVE THAT HE IS STILL ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BURDEN AND CARES OF STATE WERE HE UNABLE TO DISCHARGE THIS DUTY HE WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY DEPOSED AND PERHAPS STONED
1733-139046-0087 THE KINGS OF ETHIOPIA WERE WORSHIPPED AS GODS BUT WERE MOSTLY KEPT SHUT UP IN THEIR PALACES ON THE MOUNTAINOUS COAST OF PONTUS THERE DWELT IN ANTIQUITY A RUDE AND WARLIKE PEOPLE
1733-139046-0088 NAMED THE MOSYNI OR MOSYNOECI THROUGH WHOSE RUGGED COUNTRY THE TEN THOUSAND MARCHED ON THEIR FAMOUS RETREAT FROM ASIA TO EUROPE THESE BARBARIANS KEPT THEIR KING IN CLOSE CUSTODY AT THE TOP OF A HIGH TOWER
1733-139046-0089 FROM WHICH AFTER HIS ELECTION HE WAS NEVER MORE ALLOWED TO DESCEND HERE HE DISPENSED JUSTICE TO HIS PEOPLE BUT IF HE OFFENDED THEM THEY PUNISHED HIM BY STOPPING HIS RATIONS FOR A WHOLE DAY OR EVEN STARVING HIM TO DEATH
1733-139046-0090 THE KINGS OF SABAEA OR SHEBA THE SPICE COUNTRY OF ARABIA WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GO OUT OF THEIR PALACES
1733-139046-0091 FIVE TABOOS ON LEAVING FOOD OVER AGAIN MAGIC MISCHIEF MAY BE WROUGHT UPON A MAN THROUGH THE REMAINS OF THE FOOD HE HAS PARTAKEN OF
1733-139046-0092 AND THE REFUSE OF IT WHICH HE HAS LEFT UNTOUCHED AND HENCE BY INJURING THE REFUSE YOU CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY INJURE THE EATER AMONG THE NARRINYERI OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA
1733-139046-0093 EVERY ADULT IS CONSTANTLY ON THE LOOK OUT FOR BONES OF BEASTS BIRDS OR FISH OF WHICH THE FLESH HAS BEEN EATEN BY SOMEBODY IN ORDER TO CONSTRUCT A DEADLY CHARM OUT OF THEM EVERY ONE IS THEREFORE CAREFUL TO BURN THE BONES OF THE ANIMALS WHICH HE HAS EATEN
1733-139046-0094 LEST THEY SHOULD FALL INTO THE HANDS OF A SORCERER TOO OFTEN HOWEVER THE SORCERER SUCCEEDS IN GETTING HOLD OF SUCH A BONE AND WHEN HE DOES SO HE BELIEVES THAT HE HAS THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH OVER THE MAN WOMAN OR CHILD WHO ATE THE FLESH OF THE ANIMAL
1733-139046-0095 INSERTS IN IT THE EYE OF A COD AND A SMALL PIECE OF THE FLESH OF A CORPSE AND HAVING ROLLED THE COMPOUND
1733-139046-0096 AFTER BEING LEFT FOR SOME TIME IN THE BOSOM OF A DEAD BODY IN ORDER THAT IT MAY DERIVE A DEADLY POTENCY BY CONTACT WITH CORRUPTION THE MAGICAL IMPLEMENT IS SET UP IN THE GROUND NEAR THE FIRE AND AS THE BALL MELTS
1733-139046-0097 SO THE PERSON AGAINST WHOM THE CHARM IS DIRECTED WASTES WITH DISEASE IF THE BALL IS MELTED QUITE AWAY THE VICTIM WILL DIE WHEN THE BEWITCHED MAN LEARNS OF THE SPELL THAT IS BEING CAST UPON HIM HE ENDEAVOURS TO BUY THE BONE FROM THE SORCERER
1733-139046-0098 AND IF HE OBTAINS IT HE BREAKS THE CHARM BY THROWING THE BONE INTO A RIVER OR LAKE IN TANA ONE OF THE NEW HEBRIDES PEOPLE BURY OR THROW INTO THE SEA THE LEAVINGS OF THEIR FOOD LEST THESE SHOULD FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE DISEASE MAKERS
1733-139046-0099 FOR IF A DISEASE MAKER FINDS THE REMNANTS OF A MEAL SAY THE SKIN OF A BANANA HE PICKS IT UP AND BURNS IT SLOWLY IN THE FIRE
1733-139046-0100 OFFERING HIM PRESENTS IF HE WILL STOP BURNING THE BANANA SKIN IN NEW GUINEA THE NATIVES TAKE THE UTMOST CARE TO DESTROY OR CONCEAL THE HUSKS AND OTHER REMAINS OF THEIR FOOD
1733-139046-0101 LEST THESE SHOULD BE FOUND BY THEIR ENEMIES AND USED BY THEM FOR THE INJURY OR DESTRUCTION OF THE EATERS HENCE THEY BURN THEIR LEAVINGS THROW THEM INTO THE SEA OR OTHERWISE PUT THEM OUT OF HARM'S WAY FROM A LIKE
1733-139046-0102 FEAR NO DOUBT OF SORCERY NO ONE MAY TOUCH THE FOOD WHICH THE KING OF LOANGO LEAVES UPON HIS PLATE IT IS BURIED IN A HOLE IN THE GROUND AND NO ONE MAY DRINK OUT OF THE KING'S VESSEL
1733-139046-0103 IN ANTIQUITY THE ROMANS USED IMMEDIATELY TO BREAK THE SHELLS OF EGGS AND OF SNAILS WHICH THEY HAD EATEN IN ORDER TO PREVENT ENEMIES FROM MAKING MAGIC WITH THEM THE COMMON PRACTICE STILL OBSERVED AMONG US OF BREAKING EGG SHELLS AFTER THE EGGS HAVE BEEN EATEN
1733-139046-0104 MAY VERY WELL HAVE ORIGINATED IN THE SAME SUPERSTITION THE SUPERSTITIOUS FEAR OF THE MAGIC THAT MAY BE WROUGHT ON A MAN THROUGH THE LEAVINGS OF HIS FOOD
1733-139046-0105 NOT A MERELY IMAGINARY SOURCE OF DISEASE AND DEATH NOR IS IT ONLY THE SANITARY CONDITION OF A TRIBE WHICH HAS BENEFITED BY THIS SUPERSTITION CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE SAME BASELESS DREAD THE SAME FALSE NOTION OF CAUSATION
1733-139046-0106 WILL HIMSELF PARTAKE OF THAT FOOD BECAUSE IF HE DID SO HE WOULD ON THE PRINCIPLES OF SYMPATHETIC MAGIC SUFFER EQUALLY WITH HIS ENEMY FROM ANY INJURY DONE TO THE REFUSE
1733-139046-0107 THIS IS THE IDEA WHICH IN PRIMITIVE SOCIETY LENDS SANCTITY TO THE BOND PRODUCED BY EATING TOGETHER BY PARTICIPATION IN THE SAME FOOD TWO MEN GIVE AS IT WERE HOSTAGES FOR THEIR GOOD BEHAVIOUR
1733-139046-0108 EACH GUARANTEES THE OTHER THAT HE WILL DEVISE NO MISCHIEF AGAINST HIM SINCE BEING PHYSICALLY UNITED WITH HIM BY THE COMMON FOOD IN THEIR STOMACHS
