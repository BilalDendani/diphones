5123-34572-0000 PORTLAND BILL AN OBSTINATE NORTH WIND BLEW WITHOUT CEASING OVER THE MAINLAND OF EUROPE AND YET MORE ROUGHLY OVER ENGLAND DURING ALL THE MONTH OF DECEMBER SIXTEEN EIGHTY NINE
5123-34572-0001 AND ALL THE MONTH OF JANUARY SIXTEEN NINETY
5123-34572-0002 WHICH CAUSED THAT WINTER TO BE NOTED AS MEMORABLE TO THE POOR ON THE MARGIN OF THE OLD BIBLE IN THE PRESBYTERIAN CHAPEL OF THE NONJURORS IN LONDON
5123-34572-0003 THANKS TO THE LASTING QUALITIES OF THE OLD MONARCHICAL PARCHMENT EMPLOYED IN OFFICIAL REGISTERS LONG LISTS OF POOR PERSONS FOUND DEAD OF FAMINE AND COLD ARE STILL LEGIBLE IN MANY LOCAL REPOSITORIES
5123-34572-0004 PARTICULARLY IN THE ARCHIVES OF THE LIBERTY OF THE CLINK IN THE BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK OF PIE POWDER COURT WHICH SIGNIFIES DUSTY FEET COURT
5123-34572-0005 AND IN THOSE OF WHITECHAPEL COURT HELD IN THE VILLAGE OF STEPNEY BY THE BAILIFF OF THE LORD OF THE MANOR THE THAMES WAS FROZEN OVER A THING WHICH DOES NOT HAPPEN ONCE IN A CENTURY
5123-34572-0006 COACHES ROLLED OVER THE FROZEN RIVER AND A FAIR WAS HELD WITH BOOTHS BEAR BAITING AND BULL BAITING AN OX WAS ROASTED WHOLE ON THE ICE THIS THICK ICE LASTED TWO MONTHS
5123-34572-0007 THE HARD YEAR SIXTEEN NINETY SURPASSED IN SEVERITY EVEN THE FAMOUS WINTERS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
5123-34572-0008 THE SAME WHO WAS IN HIS QUALITY OF APOTHECARY TO KING JAMES HONOURED BY THE CITY OF LONDON WITH A BUST AND A PEDESTAL ONE EVENING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF ONE OF THE MOST BITTER DAYS OF THE MONTH OF JANUARY SIXTEEN NINETY
5123-34572-0009 THE MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL WHICH LINE THE BAY DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF CERTAIN WINDS AND CONSEQUENTLY THE MOST LONELY CONVENIENT BY REASON OF ITS VERY DANGER FOR SHIPS IN HIDING A LITTLE VESSEL ALMOST TOUCHING THE CLIFF
5123-34572-0010 WE ARE WRONG IN SAYING THE NIGHT FALLS WE SHOULD SAY THE NIGHT RISES FOR IT IS FROM THE EARTH THAT OBSCURITY COMES IT WAS ALREADY NIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF IT WAS STILL DAY AT TOP
5123-34572-0011 ANY ONE APPROACHING THE VESSEL'S MOORINGS WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED A BISCAYAN HOOKER THE SUN CONCEALED ALL DAY BY THE MIST HAD JUST SET
5123-34572-0012 THERE WAS BEGINNING TO BE FELT THAT DEEP AND SOMBROUS MELANCHOLY WHICH MIGHT BE CALLED
5123-34572-0013 WITH NO WIND FROM THE SEA THE WATER OF THE CREEK WAS CALM THIS WAS ESPECIALLY IN WINTER A LUCKY EXCEPTION ALMOST ALL THE PORTLAND CREEKS HAVE SAND BARS
5123-34572-0014 AND IN HEAVY WEATHER THE SEA BECOMES VERY ROUGH AND TO PASS IN SAFETY MUCH SKILL AND PRACTICE ARE NECESSARY THESE LITTLE PORTS PORTS MORE IN APPEARANCE THAN FACT ARE OF SMALL ADVANTAGE
5123-34572-0015 THEY ARE HAZARDOUS TO ENTER FEARFUL TO LEAVE ON THIS EVENING FOR A WONDER THERE WAS NO DANGER THE BISCAY HOOKER IS OF AN ANCIENT MODEL NOW FALLEN INTO DISUSE
5123-34572-0016 THIS KIND OF HOOKER WHICH HAS DONE SERVICE EVEN IN THE NAVY WAS STOUTLY BUILT IN ITS HULL A BOAT IN SIZE A SHIP IN STRENGTH IT FIGURED IN THE ARMADA
5123-34572-0017 THUS THE GREAT GRIFFIN BEARING A CAPTAIN'S FLAG AND COMMANDED BY LOPEZ DE MEDINA MEASURED SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY GOOD TONS AND CARRIED FORTY GUNS BUT THE MERCHANT AND CONTRABAND HOOKERS WERE VERY FEEBLE SPECIMENS
5123-34572-0018 SEA FOLK HELD THEM AT THEIR TRUE VALUE AND ESTEEMED THE MODEL A VERY SORRY ONE THE RIGGING OF THE HOOKER WAS MADE OF HEMP SOMETIMES WITH WIRE INSIDE
5123-34572-0019 WHICH WAS PROBABLY INTENDED AS A MEANS HOWEVER UNSCIENTIFIC
5123-34572-0020 THE LIGHTNESS OF THIS RIGGING DID NOT EXCLUDE THE USE OF HEAVY TACKLE
5123-34572-0021 THE HELM WAS VERY LONG WHICH GIVES THE ADVANTAGE OF A LONG ARM OF LEVERAGE BUT THE DISADVANTAGE OF A SMALL ARC OF EFFORT TWO WHEELS IN TWO PULLEYS AT THE END OF THE RUDDER CORRECTED THIS DEFECT
5123-34572-0022 AND COMPENSATED TO SOME EXTENT FOR THE LOSS OF STRENGTH THE COMPASS WAS WELL HOUSED IN A CASE PERFECTLY SQUARE AND WELL BALANCED BY ITS TWO COPPER FRAMES PLACED HORIZONTALLY ONE IN THE OTHER
5123-34572-0023 ON LITTLE BOLTS AS IN CARDAN'S LAMPS THERE WAS SCIENCE AND CUNNING IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HOOKER BUT IT WAS IGNORANT SCIENCE AND BARBAROUS CUNNING THE HOOKER WAS PRIMITIVE JUST LIKE THE PRAAM AND THE CANOE
5123-34572-0024 AND LIKE ALL VESSELS BORN OF THE INSTINCT OF THE PIRATE AND FISHERMAN IT HAD REMARKABLE SEA QUALITIES IT WAS EQUALLY WELL SUITED TO LANDLOCKED AND TO OPEN WATERS
5123-34572-0025 ITS SYSTEM OF SAILS COMPLICATED IN STAYS AND VERY PECULIAR ALLOWED OF ITS NAVIGATING TRIMLY IN THE CLOSE BAYS OF ASTURIAS WHICH ARE LITTLE MORE THAN ENCLOSED BASINS AS PASAGES FOR INSTANCE
5123-34572-0026 THE HOOKER IS AMONG VESSELS WHAT THE WAGTAIL IS AMONG BIRDS ONE OF THE SMALLEST AND ONE OF THE BOLDEST THE WAGTAIL PERCHING ON A REED SCARCELY BENDS IT AND FLYING AWAY CROSSES THE OCEAN
5123-34572-0027 THESE BISCAY HOOKERS EVEN TO THE POOREST WERE GILT AND PAINTED TATTOOING IS PART OF THE GENIUS OF THOSE CHARMING PEOPLE SAVAGES TO SOME DEGREE THE SUBLIME COLOURING OF THEIR MOUNTAINS
5123-34572-0028 VARIEGATED BY SNOWS AND MEADOWS REVEALS TO THEM THE RUGGED SPELL WHICH ORNAMENT POSSESSES IN ITSELF THEY ARE POVERTY STRICKEN AND MAGNIFICENT THEY PUT COATS OF ARMS ON THEIR COTTAGES
5123-34572-0029 THEY HAVE HUGE ASSES WHICH THEY BEDIZEN WITH BELLS AND HUGE OXEN ON WHICH THEY PUT HEAD DRESSES OF FEATHERS THEIR COACHES WHICH YOU CAN HEAR GRINDING THE WHEELS TWO LEAGUES OFF ARE ILLUMINATED
5123-34572-0030 CARVED AND HUNG WITH RIBBONS A COBBLER HAS A BAS RELIEF ON HIS DOOR IT IS ONLY SAINT CRISPIN AND AN OLD SHOE BUT IT IS IN STONE THEY TRIM THEIR LEATHERN JACKETS WITH LACE
5123-34572-0031 THEY DO NOT MEND THEIR RAGS BUT THEY EMBROIDER THEM VIVACITY PROFOUND AND SUPERB THE BASQUES ARE LIKE THE GREEKS CHILDREN OF THE SUN
5123-34572-0032 THEIR THRESHOLDS AND THEIR WINDOWS TEEM WITH FACES FAIR AND FRESH LAUGHING UNDER GARLANDS OF MAIZE A JOYOUS AND PROUD SERENITY SHINES OUT IN THEIR INGENIOUS ARTS IN THEIR TRADES IN THEIR CUSTOMS
5123-34572-0033 IN THE DRESS OF THEIR MAIDENS IN THEIR SONGS THE MOUNTAIN THAT COLOSSAL RUIN IS ALL AGLOW IN BISCAY
5123-34572-0034 IS FULL OF IDYLLS BISCAY IS
5123-34572-0035 FONTARABIA WITH STORMS WITH CLOUDS WITH SPRAY FLYING OVER THE CAPES WITH THE RAGES OF THE WAVES AND THE WINDS WITH TERROR WITH UPROAR MINGLE BOAT WOMEN CROWNED WITH ROSES
5123-34572-0036 HE WHO HAS SEEN THE BASQUE COUNTRY WISHES TO SEE IT AGAIN IT IS
5123-34572-0037 TWO HARVESTS A YEAR VILLAGES RESONANT AND GAY A STATELY POVERTY ALL SUNDAY THE SOUND OF GUITARS DANCING CASTANETS LOVE MAKING HOUSES CLEAN AND BRIGHT
5123-34572-0038 STORKS IN THE BELFRIES LET US RETURN TO PORTLAND THAT RUGGED MOUNTAIN IN THE SEA THE PENINSULA OF PORTLAND LOOKED AT GEOMETRICALLY
5123-34572-0039 PRESENTS THE APPEARANCE OF A BIRD'S HEAD OF WHICH THE BILL IS TURNED TOWARDS THE OCEAN THE BACK OF THE HEAD TOWARDS WEYMOUTH THE ISTHMUS IS ITS NECK PORTLAND
5123-34572-0040 GREATLY TO THE SACRIFICE OF ITS WILDNESS EXISTS NOW BUT FOR TRADE THE COASTS OF PORTLAND WERE DISCOVERED BY QUARRYMEN AND PLASTERERS TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY SINCE THAT PERIOD
5123-34572-0041 WHAT IS CALLED ROMAN CEMENT HAS BEEN MADE OF THE PORTLAND STONE A USEFUL INDUSTRY ENRICHING THE DISTRICT AND DISFIGURING THE BAY TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO THESE COASTS WERE EATEN AWAY AS A CLIFF
5123-34572-0042 TO DAY AS A QUARRY THE PICK BITES MEANLY THE WAVE GRANDLY HENCE A DIMINUTION OF BEAUTY TO THE MAGNIFICENT RAVAGES OF THE OCEAN
5123-34572-0043 HAVE SUCCEEDED THE MEASURED STROKES OF MEN THESE MEASURED STROKES HAVE WORKED AWAY THE CREEK WHERE THE BISCAY HOOKER WAS MOORED TO FIND ANY VESTIGE OF THE LITTLE ANCHORAGE NOW DESTROYED
5123-34572-0044 TOWARDS THE POINT BEYOND FOLLY PIER AND DIRDLE PIER BEYOND WAKEHAM EVEN BETWEEN THE PLACE CALLED CHURCH HOPE AND THE PLACE CALLED SOUTHWELL THE CREEK
5123-34572-0045 WALLED IN ON ALL SIDES BY PRECIPICES HIGHER THAN ITS WIDTH WAS MINUTE BY MINUTE BECOMING MORE OVERSHADOWED BY EVENING
5123-34572-0046 IT WAS LIKE A GROWTH OF DARKNESS AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL THE OPENING OF THE CREEK SEAWARD A NARROW PASSAGE TRACED ON THE ALMOST NIGHT BLACK INTERIOR A PALLID RIFT WHERE THE WAVES WERE MOVING
5123-34572-0047 PLACED THE VESSEL IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE LAND DARK FIGURES WERE CROSSING AND RECROSSING EACH OTHER ON THIS TOTTERING GANGWAY AND IN THE SHADOW SOME PEOPLE WERE EMBARKING
5123-34572-0048 IT WAS LESS COLD IN THE CREEK THAN OUT AT SEA THANKS TO THE SCREEN OF ROCK RISING OVER THE NORTH OF THE BASIN WHICH DID NOT HOWEVER PREVENT THE PEOPLE FROM SHIVERING THEY WERE HURRYING
5123-34572-0049 CERTAIN INDENTATIONS IN THEIR CLOTHES WERE VISIBLE AND SHOWED THAT THEY BELONGED TO THE CLASS CALLED IN ENGLAND THE RAGGED THE TWISTING OF THE PATHWAY COULD BE DISTINGUISHED VAGUELY IN THE RELIEF OF THE CLIFF
5123-34572-0050 A GIRL WHO LETS HER STAY LACE HANG DOWN TRAILING OVER THE BACK OF AN ARMCHAIR DESCRIBES WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF IT MOST OF THE PATHS OF CLIFFS AND MOUNTAINS THE PATHWAY OF THIS CREEK
5123-34572-0051 FULL OF KNOTS AND ANGLES ALMOST PERPENDICULAR AND BETTER ADAPTED FOR GOATS THAN MEN TERMINATED ON THE PLATFORM WHERE THE PLANK WAS PLACED THE PATHWAYS OF CLIFFS ORDINARILY IMPLY A NOT VERY INVITING DECLIVITY
5123-34572-0052 THEY OFFER THEMSELVES LESS AS A ROAD THAN AS A FALL THEY SINK RATHER THAN INCLINE THIS ONE PROBABLY SOME RAMIFICATION OF A ROAD ON THE PLAIN ABOVE WAS DISAGREEABLE TO LOOK AT SO VERTICAL WAS IT
5123-34572-0053 FROM UNDERNEATH YOU SAW IT GAIN BY ZIGZAG THE HIGHER LAYER OF THE CLIFF WHERE IT PASSED OUT THROUGH DEEP PASSAGES ON TO THE HIGH PLATEAU BY A CUTTING IN THE ROCK AND THE PASSENGERS FOR WHOM THE VESSEL WAS WAITING IN THE CREEK
5123-34572-0054 MUST HAVE COME BY THIS PATH EXCEPTING THE MOVEMENT OF EMBARKATION WHICH WAS BEING MADE IN THE CREEK A MOVEMENT VISIBLY SCARED AND UNEASY ALL AROUND WAS SOLITUDE NO STEP NO NOISE
5123-34572-0055 NO BREATH WAS HEARD AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROADS AT THE ENTRANCE OF RINGSTEAD BAY YOU COULD JUST PERCEIVE A FLOTILLA OF SHARK FISHING BOATS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY OUT OF THEIR RECKONING
5123-34572-0056 THESE POLAR BOATS HAD BEEN DRIVEN FROM DANISH INTO ENGLISH WATERS BY THE WHIMS OF THE SEA NORTHERLY WINDS PLAY THESE TRICKS ON FISHERMEN THEY HAD JUST TAKEN REFUGE IN THE ANCHORAGE OF PORTLAND
5123-34572-0057 A SIGN OF BAD WEATHER EXPECTED AND DANGER OUT AT SEA THEY WERE ENGAGED IN CASTING ANCHOR THE CHIEF BOAT PLACED IN FRONT AFTER THE OLD MANNER OF NORWEGIAN FLOTILLAS
5123-34572-0058 ALL HER RIGGING STANDING OUT IN BLACK ABOVE THE WHITE LEVEL OF THE SEA AND IN FRONT MIGHT BE PERCEIVED THE HOOK IRON LOADED WITH ALL KINDS OF HOOKS AND HARPOONS DESTINED FOR THE GREENLAND SHARK THE DOGFISH
5123-34572-0059 AND THE SPINOUS SHARK AS WELL AS THE NETS TO PICK UP THE SUNFISH EXCEPT A FEW OTHER CRAFT ALL SWEPT INTO THE SAME CORNER THE EYE MET NOTHING LIVING ON THE VAST HORIZON OF PORTLAND
5123-34572-0060 NOT A HOUSE NOT A SHIP THE COAST IN THOSE DAYS WAS NOT INHABITED AND THE ROADS AT THAT SEASON WERE NOT SAFE WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THE APPEARANCE OF THE WEATHER
5123-34572-0061 THE BEINGS WHO WERE GOING TO SAIL AWAY IN THE BISCAYAN URCA PRESSED ON THE HOUR OF DEPARTURE ALL THE SAME THEY FORMED A BUSY AND CONFUSED GROUP IN RAPID MOVEMENT ON THE SHORE
5123-34572-0062 TO DISTINGUISH ONE FROM ANOTHER WAS DIFFICULT IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHETHER THEY WERE OLD OR YOUNG THE INDISTINCTNESS OF EVENING INTERMIXED AND BLURRED THEM
5123-34572-0063 THEY WERE SKETCHES IN THE NIGHT THERE WERE EIGHT OF THEM AND THERE WERE SEEMINGLY AMONG THEM ONE OR TWO WOMEN HARD TO RECOGNIZE UNDER THE RAGS AND TATTERS IN WHICH THE GROUP WAS ATTIRED
5123-34572-0064 CLOTHES WHICH WERE NO LONGER MAN'S OR WOMAN'S RAGS HAVE NO SEX A SMALLER SHADOW FLITTING TO AND FRO AMONG THE LARGER ONES INDICATED EITHER A DWARF OR A CHILD
