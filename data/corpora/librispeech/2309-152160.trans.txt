2309-152160-0000 SINCE THE WINDOW CURTAINS OF THE CAR WERE TIGHTLY DRAWN
2309-152160-0001 THE CAR STOPPED THE DOOR WAS OPENED HE WAS PUSHED TOWARD IT
2309-152160-0002 HE WAS STANDING ON A CORNER ON RIVERSIDE DRIVE WITHIN A FEW DOORS OF HIS OWN HOUSE
2309-152160-0003 WHERE WAS THIS CRIME CLUB THEY HAD BEEN AS NEARLY AS HE COULD ESTIMATE TWO HOURS IN MAKING THE JOURNEY
2309-152160-0004 GRANTING THEN AN AVERAGE SPEED OF FORTY MILES AN HOUR WHICH WAS OVERGENEROUS TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE AND THE FACT THAT THEY CERTAINLY HAD NOT CROSSED THE HUDSON WHICH NOW LAY BEFORE HIM FLANKING THE DRIVE THE CRIME CLUB WAS SOMEWHERE WITHIN THE AREA OF A SEMICIRCLE
2309-152160-0005 WHOSE CENTRE WAS THE CORNER ON WHICH HE NOW STOOD AND WHOSE RADIUS WAS FORTY MILES OR FORTY YARDS HE FORCED A LAUGH IT WAS JUST THAT NO MORE NO LESS
2309-152160-0006 MOUNTED THE STEPS AND WITH HIS LATCH KEY THEY HAD AT LEAST PERMITTED HIM TO RETAIN THE CONTENTS OF HIS POCKETS WHEN THEY HAD FORCED HIM TO CHANGE HIS CLOTHES OPENED THE FRONT DOOR SOFTLY AND STEPPING INSIDE CLOSED THE DOOR AS SILENTLY AS HE HAD OPENED IT HE PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT TO LISTEN
2309-152160-0007 THERE WAS NOT A SOUND THE SERVANTS NATURALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN BED HOURS AGO EVEN OLD JASON JIMMIE DALE SMILED HALF WHIMSICALLY HALF AFFECTIONATELY WHOSE PATERNAL CUSTOM IT WAS TO SIT UP FOR HIS MASTER JIM
2309-152160-0008 WHO AS HE WAS FOND OF SAYING HE HAD DANDLED AS A BABY ON HIS KNEE HAD EVIDENTLY GIVEN IT UP AS A BAD JOB ON THIS OCCASION
2309-152160-0009 JIMMIE DALE STEPPED TO THE SWITCH AND TURNED OFF THE LIGHT THEN STOOD HESITANT IN THE DARKNESS
2309-152160-0010 MONEY HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AGAIN A LITTLE GRIMLY THIS TIME
2309-152160-0011 THERE WAS PLENTY OF MONEY NOW HIDDEN IN THE SANCTUARY ENOUGH FOR ANY EMERGENCY ENOUGH TO LAST HIM INDEFINITELY HE STEPPED FORWARD ALONG THE HALL HIS TREAD NOISELESS ON THE RICH HEAVY RUG PASSED INTO THE REAR OF THE HOUSE DESCENDED THE BACK STAIRS
2309-152160-0012 AND REACHED THE CELLAR IT WAS BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE GROUND OF COURSE BUT A NARROW WINDOW HERE
2309-152160-0013 GAVE ON THE DRIVEWAY AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE THAT LED TO THE GARAGE IN THE REAR CAUTIOUSLY NOW FOR THE CEMENT FLOORING WAS IN THE STILLNESS LITTLE LESS THAN A SOUNDING BOARD JIMMIE DALE REACHED THE WALL
2309-152160-0014 THE LOWER EDGE OF WHOSE SILL WAS JUST SLIGHTLY BELOW THE LEVEL OF HIS SHOULDER IT OPENED INWARD IF HE REMEMBERED CORRECTLY HIS FINGERS WERE FEELING FOR THE FASTENINGS IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE A THING HE MUTTERED IN ANNOYANCE WHERE WERE THE FASTENINGS AT THE SIDES OR AT THE BOTTOM
2309-152160-0015 WHAT DID THIS MEAN WIRES
2309-152160-0016 HIS FINGERS WERE WORKING NOW WITH FEVERISH HASTE TELEGRAPHING THEIR MESSAGE TO HIS BRAIN
2309-152160-0017 TINY FRAGMENTS OF WOOD AS FROM AN AUGER WERE STILL ON THE SILL AND HERE WAS A SMALL PARTICLE OF WIRE INSULATION THAT THOSE SENSITIVE FINGER TIPS PROCLAIMED WAS FRESH A COLD THRILL RAN THROUGH JIMMIE DALE AND THERE CAME AGAIN THAT SICKENING SENSE OF IMPOTENCY
2309-152160-0018 DEVILISH CUNNING ARRAYED AGAINST HIM THAT ONCE BEFORE HE HAD EXPERIENCED THAT NIGHT
2309-152160-0019 AND HE HAD BEEN FORESTALLED HIMSELF THIS COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN DONE THEY HAD HAD NO INTEREST IN HIM BEFORE THEN WHILE THEY HELD HIM AT THE CRIME CLUB WHILE HE WAS SPENDING THAT TWO HOURS IN THE CAR WAS THAT WHY THEY HAD TAKEN SO LONG IN COMING
2309-152160-0020 WAS THAT WHY THE CAR HAD STOPPED THAT TIME THAT THOSE WITH HIM MIGHT BE TOLD THAT THE WORK HERE HAD BEEN COMPLETED AND HE NEED NO LONGER BE KEPT AWAY HE EDGED AWAY FROM THE WINDOW AND AS CAUTIOUSLY AS HE HAD COME RETRACED HIS STEPS ACROSS THE CELLAR AND UP THE STAIRS
2309-152160-0021 AND THEN THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING HEARD FROM WITHOUT GONE HE BROKE INTO A RUN THERE WAS NO NEED TO WONDER LONG WHAT THOSE WIRES MEANT THEY COULD MEAN ONLY ONE OF TWO THINGS AND THE CRIME CLUB WOULD HAVE LITTLE CONCERN IN HIS ELECTRIC LIGHT THEY HAD TAPPED HIS TELEPHONE
2309-152160-0022 THE MAINS HE KNEW RAN INTO THE CELLAR FROM THE UNDERGROUND SERVICE IN THE STREET HE WAS RACING LIKE A MADMAN NOW HOW LONG AGO HOW MANY HOURS AGO HAD THEY DONE THAT GREAT SCOTT SHE WAS TO HAVE TELEPHONED HAD SHE DONE SO
2309-152160-0023 WAS THE GAME ALL EVERYTHING SHE HERSELF AT THEIR MERCY ALREADY IF SHE HAD TELEPHONED
2309-152160-0024 HE WOULD LOOK THERE FIRST AFTERWARD HE WOULD WAKEN JASON HE GAINED THE DOOR OF HIS DEN ON THE FIRST LANDING
2309-152160-0025 JASON HE CRIED OUT THE OLD BUTLER FULLY DRESSED
2309-152160-0026 JIMMIE DALE DEMANDED SHARPLY WELL SIR SAID JASON

2309-152160-0033 THAT'LL BE HER AGAIN SIR HE SAID HOARSELY WAIT SAID JIMMIE DALE TERSELY HE WAS TRYING TO THINK TO THINK FASTER THAN HE HAD EVER THOUGHT BEFORE
2309-152160-0034 THEY KNEW HE WAS IN IT WOULD BE BUT SHOWING HIS HAND TO THAT SOME ONE WHO WOULD BE LISTENING NOW ON THE WIRE HE DARED NOT SPEAK TO HER OR ABOVE ALL ALLOW HER TO EXPOSE HERSELF BY A SINGLE INADVERTENT WORD
2309-152160-0035 CALLING HIM HE COULD NOT SPEAK TO HER AND IT WAS LIFE AND DEATH ALMOST THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW
2309-152160-0036 LIFE AND DEATH ALMOST FOR BOTH OF THEM THAT HE SHOULD KNOW ALL AND EVERYTHING SHE COULD TELL HIM
2309-152160-0037 ONLY A MINUTE TO CUT THOSE WIRES
2309-152160-0038 THE FACT THAT HE HAD DISCOVERED THEIR TRICK ADMIT AS THOUGH IN SO MANY WORDS THAT THEIR SUSPICIONS OF HIM WERE JUSTIFIED
2309-152160-0039 BY MEANS OF WHICH THERE WAS A CHANCE THAT HE COULD HOIST THEM WITH THEIR OWN PETARD THE TELEPHONE RANG AGAIN IMPERATIVELY PERSISTENTLY LISTEN JASON JIMMIE DALE WAS SPEAKING RAPIDLY EARNESTLY
2309-152160-0040 IN A VILE HUMOUR THAT YOU TOLD ME A LADY HAD BEEN CALLING BUT THAT I SAID IF SHE CALLED AGAIN I WASN'T TO BE DISTURBED
2309-152160-0041 JASON LIFTED THE RECEIVER FROM THE HOOK YES HELLO HE SAID YES MA'AM MISTER DALE HAS COME IN BUT HE HAS RETIRED YES I TOLD HIM BUT BEGGING YOUR PARDON MA'AM
2309-152160-0042 HE WAS IN WHAT I MIGHT SAY WAS A BIT OF A TEMPER AND SAID HE WASN'T TO BE DISTURBED BY ANY ONE JIMMIE DALE SNATCHED THE RECEIVER FROM JASON AND PUT IT TO HIS OWN EAR KINDLY TELL MISTER DALE THAT UNLESS HE COMES TO THE PHONE NOW A FEMININE VOICE HER VOICE
2309-152160-0043 IN WELL SIMULATED INDIGNATION WAS SAYING IT WILL BE A VERY LONG DAY BEFORE I SHALL TROUBLE MYSELF TO JIMMIE DALE CLAPPED HIS HAND FIRMLY OVER THE MOUTHPIECE OF THE INSTRUMENT THANK GOD FOR THAT CLEVER BRAIN OF HERS SHE UNDERSTOOD
2309-152160-0044 THEN SAY GOOD NIGHT HE REMOVED HIS HAND FROM THE MOUTHPIECE IT'S QUITE USELESS MA'AM SAID JASON APOLOGETICALLY IN THE RARE TEMPER HE WAS IN HE WOULDN'T COME TO USE HIS OWN WORDS MA'AM NOT FOR THE QUEEN OF SHEBA HERSELF MA'AM
2309-152160-0045 GOOD NIGHT MA'AM JIMMIE DALE HUNG THE RECEIVER BACK ON THE HOOK AND WITH HIS HAND FLIRTED AWAY A BEAD OF MOISTURE THAT HAD SPRUNG TO HIS FOREHEAD GOOD LORD MASTER JIM WHAT'S WRONG SIR WHAT'S HAPPENED SIR

2309-152160-0047 JIMMIE DALE MOVED TO THE REAR OF THE ROOM TO THE WINDOW OVERLOOKING THE GARAGE AND YARD I DON'T SEE ANYTHING SIR JASON CALLED WATCH JIMMIE DALE ANSWERED A MINUTE PASSED TWO THREE
2309-152160-0048 JIMMIE DALE WAS STARING DOWN INTO THE BLACK OF THE YARD SHE UNDERSTOOD SHE KNEW OF COURSE BEFORE SHE PHONED THAT SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG TO NIGHT SHE KNEW THAT ONLY PERIL OF THE GRAVEST MOMENT WOULD HAVE KEPT HIM FROM THE PHONE AND HER SHE KNEW NOW
2309-152160-0049 AS A LOGICAL CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS TO ATTEMPT TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM AT HIS HOME THOSE WIRES WHERE DID THEY LEAD TO NOT FAR AWAY THAT WOULD BE ALMOST A MECHANICAL IMPOSSIBILITY
2309-152160-0050 OR THE BASEMENT SAY OF THAT APARTMENT HOUSE ACROSS THE DRIVEWAY OR WHERE AND THEN JIMMIE DALE SPOKE AGAIN
2309-152160-0051 I'M NOT SURE SIR JASON ANSWERED HESITANTLY I THOUGHT I SAW A MAN MOVE BEHIND A TREE OUT THERE ACROSS THE ROAD A MINUTE AGO SIR
2309-152160-0052 THERE WAS A THIN MIRTHLESS SMILE ON JIMMIE DALE'S LIPS
2309-152160-0053 AND WAS STILL AGAIN WHAT TIME IS IT JASON JIMMIE DALE ASKED PRESENTLY IT'LL BE ABOUT HALF PAST FOUR SIR GO TO BED JASON YES SIR BUT JASON'S VOICE LOW TROUBLED CAME THROUGH THE DARKNESS FROM THE UPPER END OF THE ROOM
2309-152160-0054 MASTER JIM SIR I GO TO BED JASON AND NOT A WORD OF THIS YES SIR GOOD NIGHT MASTER JIM GOOD NIGHT JASON JIMMIE DALE GROPED HIS WAY TO THE BIG LOUNGING CHAIR IN WHICH HE HAD FOUND JASON ASLEEP AND FLUNG HIMSELF INTO IT
2309-152160-0055 THEY HAD STRUCK QUICKLY THESE INGENIOUS DRESS SUITED MURDERERS OF THE CRIME CLUB THE HOUSE WAS ALREADY WATCHED WOULD BE WATCHED NOW UNTIRINGLY UNCEASINGLY NOT A MOVEMENT OF HIS HENCEFORTH BUT WOULD BE UNDER THEIR EYES
2309-152160-0056 HIS HANDS RESTING ON THE ARMS OF THE CHAIR CLOSED SLOWLY UNTIL THEY BECAME TIGHT CLENCHED KNOTTED FISTS WHAT WAS HE TO DO IT WAS NOT ONLY THE CRIME CLUB IT WAS NOT ONLY THE TOCSIN AND HER PERIL
2309-152160-0057 HIS LIFE EVEN BEFORE THIS IN HIS FIGHT AGAINST THE UNDERWORLD AND THE POLICE HAD DEPENDED UPON HIS FREEDOM OF ACTION AND NOW AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME THAT FREEDOM WAS CUT AWAY FROM BENEATH HIS FEET AS IT WERE AND A THIRD FOE
2309-152160-0058 EQUALLY AS DEADLY AS THE OTHERS WAS ADDED TO THE LIST FOR MONTHS TO PRESERVE AND SUSTAIN THE CHARACTER OF LARRY THE BAT
2309-152160-0059 FOR IN THAT SORDID EMPIRE BELOW THE DEAD LINE WHOSE ONE COMMON BOND AND AIM WAS THE GRAY SEAL'S DEATH WHERE SUSPICION ONE OF THE OTHER WAS RAMPANT AND EXTRAVAGANT WHERE EACH MIGHT BE THE ONE AGAINST WHOM ALL SWORE THEIR VENGEANCE
2309-152160-0060 LARRY THE BAT COULD NOT MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEAR FROM HIS ACCUSTOMED HAUNTS WITHOUT INVITING SUSPICION IN AN ACTIVE AND PRACTICAL FORM AN INQUISITORIAL VISIT TO HIS SQUALID LODGINGS THE SANCTUARY AND THE END OF LARRY THE BAT
2309-152160-0061 IF AS HE HAD THOUGHT ONLY A FEW HOURS BEFORE HE WAS THROUGH FOREVER WITH HIS DUAL LIFE THAT WOULD NOT HAVE MATTERED
2309-152160-0062 AND WHAT MUST BE AN OBVIOUS FACT TO HER THAT THEIR PLANS HAD MISCARRIED THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM AS JIMMIE DALE SHE WOULD EXPECT HIM COUNT ON HIM TO MAKE THAT MOVE
2309-152160-0063 SHE WOULD BE WATCHING WAITING HOPING SEEKING FOR HIM MORE ANXIOUSLY AND WITH FAR MORE AT STAKE THAN HE HAD EVER SOUGHT FOR HER UNTIL NOW HE GOT UP IMPULSIVELY FROM HIS CHAIR AND IN THE BLACKNESS BEGAN TO PACE THE ROOM
2309-152160-0064 THE NEXT MOVE WAS CLEAR PITIFULLY CLEAR IT HAD BEEN CLEAR FROM THE FIRST IT HAD BEEN CLEAR EVEN IN THAT RIDE IN THE CAR IT WAS SO CLEAR THAT IT SEEMED VERITABLY TO MOCK HIM AS HE PRODDED HIS BRAINS FOR SOME MEANS OF PUTTING IT INTO EXECUTION
2309-152160-0065 HE MUST GET TO THE SANCTUARY BECOME LARRY THE BAT BUT HOW HOW THE QUESTION SEEMED AT LAST TO BECOME RESONANT TO RING THROUGH THE ROOM WITH THE WEIGHT OF DOOM UPON IT SCHEMES PLANS IDEAS CAME
2309-152160-0066 BRINGING A MOMENTARY UPLIFT ONLY TO BE DISCARDED THE NEXT INSTANT WITH A SORT OF BITTER DESPERATE REGRET THESE MEN WERE NOT MEN OF MERE ORDINARY INTELLIGENCE
2309-152160-0067 THEIR CLEVERNESS THEIR POWER THE AMAZING SCOPE OF THEIR ORGANISATION ALL BORE GRIM WITNESS TO THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD BE BLINDED NOT AT ALL BY ANY PALTRY RUSE
2309-152160-0068 THAT WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH AND SO LONG AS HE PURSUED THE USUAL AVOCATIONS OF JIMMIE DALE HE WOULD NOT BE INTERFERED WITH ONLY WATCHED IT WAS USELESS TO CONSIDER THAT PLAN FOR A MOMENT
2309-152160-0069 BUT HE COULD HARDLY HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING LIKE THAT WITHOUT THEIR KNOWING THAT IT WAS DONE DELIBERATELY AND THAT HE DARED NOT RISK
2309-152160-0070 BESIDES THERE WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY SUCH A PLAN WOULD NOT DO FOR GRANTING EVEN THAT HE SUCCEEDED IN ELUDING THEM ON THE WAY AND MANAGED TO REACH THE SANCTUARY
2309-152160-0071 HE WOULD HAVE TO RETURN TO HIS HOME HERE AGAIN WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME AS JIMMIE DALE WITHIN A FEW HOURS AT MOST
2309-152160-0072 WHEN HE HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE HALF AN HOUR PREVIOUSLY
2309-152160-0073 THEN HE HAD COUNTED ON GETTING AWAY WITHOUT THEIR KNOWING IT BEFORE THEY AS HE HAD FONDLY THOUGHT WOULD HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO ESTABLISH THEIR ESPIONAGE
2309-152160-0074 FOR A TIME AT LEAST THAT HE WAS NOT STILL WITHIN THE HOUSE WHEN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN WATCHING AS IT WERE AN EMPTY CAGE HE STOPPED IN HIS WALK AND AFTER A MOMENT DROPPED DOWN INTO THE LOUNGING CHAIR AGAIN THAT WAS IT OF COURSE AN EMPTY CAGE IF HE COULD ESCAPE FROM THE HOUSE
2309-152160-0075 BUT ESCAPE AND LEAVE THEM IN POSSESSION OF A SORT OF GUARANTEE OR ASSURANCE THAT HE WAS STILL THERE THAT WOULD GIVE HIM THE FREEDOM OF ACTION THAT HE MUST HAVE HE SMILED WITH BITTER IRONY THAT SOLVED THE PROBLEM THAT WAS ALL THERE WAS TO IT JUST THAT
2309-152160-0076 IT WAS VERY SIMPLE EXCEEDINGLY SIMPLE IT WAS ONLY IMPOSSIBLE
