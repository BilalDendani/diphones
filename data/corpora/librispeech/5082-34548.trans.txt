5082-34548-0000 THE NIGHT BEFORE THE WEDDING THE TALE OF A BRIDE ELECT THE NEXT DAY WE ALL HUNG ABOUT THE GARDEN EXCEPT THE YOUNGSTER WHO DISAPPEARED ON HIS WHEEL EARLY IN THE DAY AND ONLY CAME BACK
5082-34548-0001 HOT AND DUSTY AT TEA TIME HE WAVED A HAND AT US AS HE RAN THROUGH THE GARDEN CRYING I'LL CHANGE AND BE WITH YOU IN A MOMENT AND LEAPT UP THE OUTSIDE STAIRCASE THAT LED TO THE GALLERY ON WHICH HIS ROOM OPENED AND DISAPPEARED
5082-34548-0002 I FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO UP THE OTHER STAIRCASE A LITTLE LATER THE YOUNGSTER WAS AN OLD PET OF MINE AND OFF AND ON I HAD MOTHERED HIM I TAPPED AT THE DOOR CAN'T COME IN
5082-34548-0003 WAIT THERE A MINUTE AND MUM I'LL TELL YOU
5082-34548-0004 UNTIL HE CAME SPICK AND SPAN IN WHITE FLANNELS
5082-34548-0005 SEE HERE HE WHISPERED
5082-34548-0006 DON'T LET'S TALK OF IT IN SPITE OF MYSELF I EXPECT I WENT WHITE FOR HE EXCLAIMED DARN IT I SUPPOSE I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE TOLD YOU
5082-34548-0007 IN FACT HE FORBADE MY GOING AGAIN IS IT A REAL GERMAN VICTORY I ASKED IF IT ISN'T
5082-34548-0008 THOUGH SUCH OF THE ENGLISH AS I SAW WERE IN GAY ENOUGH SPIRITS AND THERE WAS NOT AN ATMOSPHERE OF DEFEAT FACT IS I KEPT OUT OF SIGHT AND ONLY GOT STRAY IMPRESSIONS GO ON DOWN NOW OR THEY'LL GUESS SOMETHING I'M NOT GOING TO SAY A WORD YET
5082-34548-0009 AWFUL SORRY NOW I TOLD YOU FORCE OF HABIT I WENT DOWN I HAD HARD WORK FOR A FEW MINUTES TO THROW THE IMPRESSION OFF BUT THE GARDEN WAS LOVELY AND TEA BEING OVER WE ALL BUSIED OURSELVES IN RIFLING
5082-34548-0010 THE FLOWERBEDS TO DRESS THE DINNER TABLE IF WE WERE GOING IN TWO DAYS WHERE WAS THE GOOD OF LEAVING THE FLOWERS TO DIE ALONE
5082-34548-0011 WE TALKED OF THE OLD DAYS OF OURSELVES WHEN WE WERE BOYS AND GIRLS TOGETHER OF OLD PAPANTI AND OUR FIRST COTILLION OF CLASS DAYS AND I REMEMBERED AFTERWARD
5082-34548-0012 WHEN THE COFFEE CAME OUT
5082-34548-0013 THE LAWYER COUGHED TAPPED HIMSELF ON HIS CHEST
5082-34548-0014 THE AIR WAS PIERCING THERE HAD BEEN A SLIGHT FALL OF SNOW THEN A SUDDEN DROP IN THE THERMOMETER PRECEDED NIGHTFALL MISS MORELAND WRAPPED IN HER FURS WAS STANDING ON A STREET CORNER
5082-34548-0015 LOOKING IN VAIN FOR A CAB AND WONDERING AFTER ALL WHY SHE HAD VENTURED OUT
5082-34548-0016 AND SHE WAS JUST CONVENTIONAL ENOUGH IN SPITE OF HER POSE TO THE EXACT CONTRARY TO HOPE THAT NONE OF HER FRIENDS WOULD PASS SHE KNEW HER SET WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT IT WOULD CAUSE SOMETHING ALMOST LIKE A SCANDAL IF SHE WERE SEEN OUT ALONE ON FOOT ON THE VERY EVE OF HER WEDDING DAY
5082-34548-0017 REPENTING THEIR SINS AND PRAYING FOR BLESSINGS ON THE FUTURE IN THEORY BUT IN REALITY FUSSING THEMSELVES ILL OVER BELATED FINERY SHE HAD HAD FOR SOME YEARS A NUMBER OF POOR PROTEGEES IN THE LOWER END OF THE CITY
5082-34548-0018 WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO VISIT ON WORK OF A CHARITABLE NATURE BEGUN WHEN SHE WAS A SCHOOL GIRL SHE HAD FOUND WORK ENOUGH TO DO THERE EVER SINCE IT WAS WORK OF WHICH HER FATHER A HARD HEADED MAN OF BUSINESS STRONGLY DISAPPROVED ALTHOUGH HE WAS READY ENOUGH TO GIVE HIS MONEY
5082-34548-0019 JACK WAS OF HER FATHER'S MIND SHE REALIZED THAT WHEN SHE RETURNED FROM THE THREE YEARS TRIP ROUND THE WORLD ON WHICH SHE WAS STARTING THE DAY AFTER HER WEDDING SHE WOULD HAVE OTHER DUTIES AND SHE KNEW IT WOULD BE HARDER TO OPPOSE JACK AND MORE DANGEROUS
5082-34548-0020 THAN IT HAD BEEN TO OPPOSE HER FATHER IN THIS REALIZATION THERE WAS A TOUCH OF SELF REPROACH SHE KNEW IN HER OWN HEART THAT SHE WOULD BE GLAD TO DO NO MORE WORK OF THAT SORT EXPERIENCE HAD MADE HER HOPELESS
5082-34548-0021 AND SHE HAD NONE OF THE SPIRITUAL SUPPORT THAT MADE WOMEN LIKE SAINT CATHERINE OF SIENNA BUT IF EXPERIENCE HAD ROBBED HER OF HER ILLUSIONS SHE KNEW TOO THAT IT HAD SET A SEAL OF PAIN ON ALL THE FUTURE FOR HER
5082-34548-0022 SHE COULD NEVER FORGET THE MISERY SHE HAD SEEN SO IT HAD BEEN A LITTLE IN A DESIRE TO GIVE ONE MORE SOP TO HER CONSCIENCE THAT SHE HAD DEDICATED HER LAST AFTERNOON TO FREEDOM
5082-34548-0023 IF HER MOTHER HAD REMAINED AT HOME
5082-34548-0024 ALL THE MORE REASON FOR RETURNING IN GOOD SEASON AND HERE IT WAS DARK WORSE STILL THE TRIP HAD BEEN IN EVERY WAY UNSUCCESSFUL SHE HAD TURNED HER FACE HOMEWARD SIMPLY ASKING HERSELF AS SHE HAD DONE SO MANY TIMES BEFORE IF IT WERE
5082-34548-0025 WORTH WHILE AND ANSWERED THE QUESTION ONCE MORE WITH NEITHER TO ME NOR TO THEM SHE HAD ALREADY LEARNED THOUGH TOO YOUNG FOR THE LESSON THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL WORKS OUT HIS OWN SALVATION
5082-34548-0026 ARE ELECTED TO THE TASK BY SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MERE DESIRE TO SERVE IN HER CASE THE GIFT OF HER YOUTH AND HER ILLUSIONS HAD DONE OTHERS NO REAL GOOD AND HAD MORE OR LESS
5082-34548-0027 IT WOULD ONLY BE BY GIVING UP THE WORLD HER WORLD ABANDONING HER LIFE WITH ITS LUXURY ITS LOVE EVERYTHING SHE HAD BEEN BRED TO AND LONGED FOR SHE DID NOT FEEL A CALL TO DO THAT SO SHE CHOSE THE EXISTENCE TO WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BORN
5082-34548-0028 THE LOVE OF A MAN IN HER OWN SET BUT THE SHADOW OF TOO MUCH KNOWLEDGE SAT ON HER LIKE A SHADOW OF FEAR SHE WAS IMPATIENT WITH HERSELF THE WORLD LIVING
5082-34548-0029 AND THERE WAS NO CAB IN SIGHT SHE LOOKED AT HER WATCH HALF PAST FOUR
5082-34548-0030 BUT SHE HAD FELT IT ABSURD ALWAYS TO GO ABOUT THIS KIND OF WORK IN A PRIVATE CARRIAGE AND TO DAY SHE COULD NOT AS SHE USUALLY DID TAKE A STREET CAR FOR FEAR OF MEETING FRIENDS THEY THOUGHT HER QUEER ENOUGH AS IT WAS
5082-34548-0031 MISERABLE SPECIMEN AT FIRST SHE WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER IT WERE BOY OR GIRL WHIMPERING AND MOPPING ITS NOSE WITH A VERY DIRTY HAND
5082-34548-0032 FOR A SICK MOTHER A DYING MOTHER AND BEGGED AS IF NOT ACCUSTOMED TO IT ALL THE TIME WITH AN EYE FOR THAT DREAD
5082-34548-0033 MISS MORELAND WAS SO CONSCIOUSLY IRRITATED WITH LIFE THAT SHE WAS UNUSUALLY GENTLE SHE STOOPED DOWN THE CHILD DID NOT SEEM SIX YEARS OLD THE FACE WAS NOT SO VERY CUNNING IT WAS NOT UGLY EITHER
5082-34548-0034 IT WAS MERELY THE EPITOME OF ALL THAT MISS MORELAND TRIED TO FORGET THE LITTLE ONE BORN WITHOUT A CHANCE IN THE WORLD WITH A FULL APPRECIATION OF THE CHILD'S FEAR OF THE POLICE BEGGING IS A CRIME IN MANY AMERICAN TOWNS SHE CAREFULLY QUESTIONED HER
5082-34548-0035 WATCHING FOR THE DREADED OFFICER HERSELF IT WAS THE OLD STORY A DYING MOTHER NO FATHER NO ONE TO DO ANYTHING A CHILD SENT OUT TO CUNNINGLY DEFY THE LAW BUT IT SEEMED TO BE ONLY FOR BREAD
5082-34548-0036 OBVIOUSLY THE THING TO DO WAS TO DELIVER THE CHILD UP TO THE POLICE IT WOULD BE AT ONCE PROPERLY CARED FOR AND THE MOTHER ALSO BUT MISS MORELAND KNEW TOO MUCH OF OFFICIAL CHARITY TO BE GUILTY OF THAT THE EASIEST THING
5082-34548-0037 WAS TO GIVE HER MONEY BUT UNLUCKILY SHE BELONGED TO A SOCIETY PLEDGED NOT TO GIVE ALMS IN THE STREETS AND HER SENSE OF THE POWER OF A MORAL OBLIGATION WAS A STRONG NOTION OF DUTY WHICH HAD DESCENDED TO HER FROM HER PURITAN ANCESTORS
5082-34548-0038 ENCLOSED IT AND SEALED THE ENVELOPE THEN SHE WENT OUT TO THE SIDE WALK AGAIN WITH THE CHILD STOOPING OVER HER SHE MADE SURE THAT THE LITTLE ONE REALLY DID KNOW THE STREET IT ISN'T FAR FROM HERE SHE SAID GIVE THAT TO ANY ONE THERE
5082-34548-0039 AND SOMEBODY WILL GO RIGHT HOME WITH YOU TO SEE YOUR MOTHER TO WARM YOU YOU POOR LITTLE MITE AND FEED YOU AND MAKE YOU QUITE HAPPY SHE DID NOT EXPLAIN AND THE CHILD WOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD
5082-34548-0040 THAT SHE VOUCHED FOR A SPECIAL DONATION FOR THE CASE AS A SORT OF COMMEMORATIVE GIFT THE SUM WAS LARGE IT WAS A QUIXOTIC SORT OF SALVE TO A SICK CONSCIENCE WHICH TOLD HER THAT SHE OUGHT TO GO HERSELF THE CHILD STILL SOBBING TURNED AWAY
5082-34548-0041 AND DREARILY STARTED UP THE HILL SHE DID NOT GO FAR HOWEVER MISS MORELAND HAD HER MISGIVINGS ON THAT POINT AND JUST AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO DRAW A BREATH OF RELIEF CONVINCED THAT AFTER ALL SHE WOULD GO THE GIRL STOPPED
5082-34548-0042 IT OBLIGES THEM TO BE LOOKED OVER IN ALL THEIR MISERY IT PRESUMES A WORTHINESS OR ITS PRETENCE WHICH THEY RESENT ALMOST AS MUCH AS THEY DO THE INTRUSION OF THE VISITING COMMITTEE THIS DISINCLINATION IS AS OLD AS POVERTY AND IS THE ROCK AHEAD OF
5082-34548-0043 ALL ORGANIZED CHARITY ITS EXEMPLIFICATION WAS VERY TRYING TO MISS MORELAND AT THAT MOMENT AND THE CROUCHING FIGURE WAS EXASPERATING SHE PURSUED THE CHILD SHE PULLED HER RATHER ROUGHLY TO HER FEET IT WAS SO PROVOKING TO HAVE HER SIT DOWN IN THE COLD
5082-34548-0044 TO PUT OUT OF HER MIND THERE SEEMED BUT ONE THING TO DO GO WITH THE CHILD SHE KNEW THAT IF SHE DID NOT SHE WOULD NOT SLEEP THAT NIGHT NOR SMILE THE NEXT DAY
5082-34548-0045 BESIDES IT WAS NOT YET SO VERY LATE BIDDING THE CHILD HURRY SHE FOLLOWED HER UP THE HILL AND DOWN THE OTHER SIDE TO A PART OF THE CITY WITH WHICH SHE WAS NOT FAMILIAR THE CHILD CRIED QUIETLY ALL THE WAY MISS MORELAND WAS TOO VAGUELY UNCOMFORTABLE TO TALK TO HER
5082-34548-0046 AS THEY HURRIED ALONG IT WAS IN FRONT OF A DARK HOUSE THAT THEY FINALLY STOPPED AND WENT UP THE STONE STEPS INTO A HALL SO DARK THAT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO TAKE THE CHILD'S DIRTY COLD HANDS IN HERS TO BE SURE OF THE WAY
