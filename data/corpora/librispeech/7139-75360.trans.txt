7139-75360-0000 ON THE FORTUNES OF PARTICULAR BODIES NATURAL OR CORPORATE THERE IS THEN A PRIMACY OF NATURE OVER SPIRIT IN SOCIAL LIFE AND THIS PRIMACY IN A CERTAIN SENSE ENDURES TO THE END
7139-75360-0001 SINCE ALL SPIRIT MUST BE THE SPIRIT OF SOMETHING AND REASON COULD NOT EXIST OR BE CONCEIVED AT ALL UNLESS A MATERIAL ORGANISM PERSONAL OR SOCIAL LAY BENEATH TO GIVE THOUGHT AN OCCASION AND A POINT OF VIEW
7139-75360-0002 THINGS COULD NOT BE NEAR OR FAR WORSE OR BETTER UNLESS A DEFINITE LIFE WERE TAKEN AS A STANDARD A LIFE LODGED SOMEWHERE IN SPACE AND TIME
7139-75360-0003 REASON IS A PRINCIPLE OF ORDER APPEARING IN A SUBJECT MATTER WHICH IN ITS SUBSISTENCE AND QUANTITY MUST BE AN IRRATIONAL DATUM REASON EXPRESSES PURPOSE PURPOSE EXPRESSES IMPULSE AND IMPULSE
7139-75360-0004 EXPRESSES A NATURAL BODY WITH SELF EQUILIBRATING POWERS AT THE SAME TIME NATURAL GROWTHS MAY BE CALLED ACHIEVEMENTS ONLY BECAUSE WHEN FORMED THEY SUPPORT A JOYFUL AND LIBERAL EXPERIENCE
7139-75360-0005 NATURE'S WORKS FIRST ACQUIRE A MEANING IN THE COMMENTARIES THEY PROVOKE MECHANICAL PROCESSES HAVE INTERESTING CLIMAXES ONLY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE LIFE THAT EXPRESSES THEM IN WHICH THEIR EBB AND FLOW GROWS IMPASSIONED AND VEHEMENT
7139-75360-0006 AND FLUID NOT STOPPING WHERE WE SEE A GOAL NOR AVOIDING WHAT WE CALL FAILURES AND SO THEY WOULD ALWAYS HAVE REMAINED IN CRUDE EXPERIENCE IF NO CUMULATIVE REFLECTION NO ART
7139-75360-0007 AND NO SCIENCE HAD COME TO DOMINATE AND FORESHORTEN THAT EQUABLE FLOW OF SUBSTANCE ARRESTING IT IDEALLY IN BEHALF OF SOME RATIONAL INTEREST THUS IT COMES TO PASS THAT RATIONAL INTERESTS HAVE A CERTAIN
7139-75360-0008 ASCENDANCY IN THE WORLD AS WELL AS AN ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY OVER IT FOR THEY ARISE WHERE AN ORGANIC EQUILIBRIUM HAS NATURALLY ESTABLISHED ITSELF SUCH AN EQUILIBRIUM MAINTAINS ITSELF BY VIRTUE
7139-75360-0009 OF THE SAME NECESSITY THAT PRODUCED IT WITHOUT ARRESTING THE FLUX OR INTRODUCING ANY MIRACLE IT SUSTAINS IN BEING AN IDEAL FORM THIS FORM IS WHAT CONSCIOUSNESS CORRESPONDS TO
7139-75360-0010 AND RAISES TO ACTUAL EXISTENCE SO THAT SIGNIFICANT THOUGHTS ARE SOMETHING WHICH NATURE NECESSARILY LINGERS UPON AND SEEMS TO SERVE THE BEING TO WHOM THEY COME
7139-75360-0011 THE MIND SPREADS AND SOARS IN PROPORTION AS THE BODY FEEDS ON THE SURROUNDING WORLD NOBLE IDEAS ALTHOUGH RARE AND DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN ARE NOT NATURALLY FUGITIVE
7139-75360-0012 IT CELEBRATES AN ATTAINED BALANCE IN NATURE OR GRIEVES AT ITS COLLAPSE
7139-75360-0013 IN IDEAL TERMS LOOKING TO FIXED GOALS OF ITS OWN IMAGINING AND USING NOTHING IN THE OPERATION BUT CONCRETIONS IN DISCOURSE PRIMARY MATHEMATICAL NOTIONS FOR INSTANCE
7139-75360-0014 ARE EVIDENCES OF A SUCCESSFUL REACTIVE METHOD ATTAINED IN THE ORGANISM AND TRANSLATED IN CONSCIOUSNESS INTO A STABLE GRAMMAR WHICH HAS WIDE APPLICABILITY AND GREAT PERSISTENCE SO THAT IT HAS COME
7139-75360-0015 TO BE ELABORATED IDEALLY INTO PRODIGIOUS ABSTRACT SYSTEMS OF THOUGHT EVERY EXPERIENCE OF VICTORY ELOQUENCE OR BEAUTY IS A MOMENTARY SUCCESS OF THE SAME KIND
7139-75360-0016 AND IF REPEATED AND SUSTAINED BECOMES A SPIRITUAL POSSESSION
7139-75360-0017 SOCIAL EXPERIENCE HAS ITS IDEALITY TOO SOCIETY ALSO BREEDS ITS IDEAL HARMONIES AT FIRST IT ESTABLISHES AFFECTIONS BETWEEN BEINGS NATURALLY CONJOINED IN THE WORLD
7139-75360-0018 LATER IT GROWS SENSITIVE TO FREE AND SPIRITUAL AFFINITIES TO ONENESS OF MIND AND SYMPATHETIC PURPOSES THESE IDEAL AFFINITIES ALTHOUGH GROUNDED LIKE THE OTHERS ON MATERIAL RELATIONS FOR SYMPATHY
7139-75360-0019 LOOKS AWAY FROM THEM TO ITS OWN UNIVERSE OF SOUND
7139-75360-0020 AND SPEAKS ALL THE SOLILOQUIES WHEN MOST NEARLY MATERIAL THESE PERSONAGES ARE HUMAN SOULS THE IDEAL LIFE OF PARTICULAR BODIES OR FLOATING MORTAL REPUTATIONS ECHOES OF THOSE IDEAL LIVES IN ONE ANOTHER
7139-75360-0021 FROM THIS RELATIVE SUBSTANTIALITY THEY FADE INTO NOTIONS OF COUNTRY POSTERITY HUMANITY AND THE GODS THESE FIGURES ALL REPRESENT SOME CIRCLE OF EVENTS OR FORCES IN THE REAL WORLD
7139-75360-0022 BUT SUCH REPRESENTATION BESIDES BEING MYTHICAL IS USUALLY MOST INADEQUATE THE BOUNDARIES OF THAT PROVINCE WHICH EACH SPIRIT PRESIDES OVER ARE VAGUELY DRAWN THE SPIRIT ITSELF BEING CORRESPONDINGLY INDEFINITE
7139-75360-0023 THIS AMBIGUITY IS MOST CONSPICUOUS PERHAPS IN THE MOST ABSORBING OF THE PERSONAGES WHICH A MAN CONSTRUCTS IN THIS IMAGINATIVE FASHION HIS IDEA OF HIMSELF
7139-75360-0024 THERE IS SOCIETY WHERE NONE INTRUDES AND FOR MOST MEN SYMPATHY WITH THEIR IMAGINARY SELVES IS A POWERFUL AND DOMINANT EMOTION TRUE MEMORY OFFERS BUT A MEAGRE AND INTERRUPTED VISTA
7139-75360-0025 OF PAST EXPERIENCE YET EVEN THAT PICTURE IS FAR TOO RICH A TERM FOR MENTAL DISCOURSE TO BANDY ABOUT A NAME WITH A FEW PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL CONNOTATIONS IS WHAT MUST REPRESENT THE MAN TO HIS OWN THINKINGS
7139-75360-0026 OR RATHER IT IS NO MEMORY HOWEVER
7139-75360-0027 THAT FULFILS THAT OFFICE A MAN'S NOTION OF HIMSELF
7139-75360-0028 FOR WHICH HIS MORE CONSTANT SOMATIC FEELINGS HIS RULING INTERESTS AND HIS SOCIAL RELATIONS FURNISH MOST OF THE SUBSTANCE
7139-75360-0029 ROMANTIC EGOTISM THE MORE REFLECTIVE AND SELF CONSCIOUS A MAN IS THE MORE COMPLETELY WILL HIS EXPERIENCE BE SUBSUMED AND ABSORBED IN HIS PERENNIAL I IF PHILOSOPHY HAS COME TO REINFORCE THIS REFLECTIVE EGOTISM
7139-75360-0030 HE MAY EVEN REGARD ALL NATURE AS NOTHING BUT HIS HALF VOLUNTARY DREAM AND ENCOURAGE HIMSELF THEREBY TO GIVE EVEN TO THE PHYSICAL WORLD A DRAMATIC
7139-75360-0031 PEOPLES IT WITH MYTHICAL COUNTERPARTS OF HIMSELF SOMETIMES IF HIS IMAGINATION IS SENSUOUS HIS ALTER EGOS ARE INCARNATE IN THE LANDSCAPE AND HE CREATES A POETIC MYTHOLOGY SOMETIMES WHEN THE INNER LIFE PREDOMINATES
7139-75360-0032 THEY ARE PROJECTED INTO HIS OWN FORGOTTEN PAST OR INFINITE FUTURE HE WILL THEN SAY THAT ALL EXPERIENCE IS REALLY HIS OWN AND
7139-75360-0033 THAT SOME INEXPLICABLE ILLUSION HAS MOMENTARILY RAISED OPAQUE PARTITIONS IN HIS OMNISCIENT MIND
7139-75360-0034 AS THE SPRING OF ALL HUMAN SENTIMENTS AMOUR PROPRE INVOLVES PREOCCUPATION NOT MERELY WITH THE IDEA OF SELF BUT WITH THAT IDEA REPRODUCED IN OTHER MEN'S MINDS THE SOLILOQUY
7139-75360-0035 HAS BECOME A DIALOGUE OR RATHER A SOLO WITH AN ECHOING CHORUS INTEREST IN ONE'S OWN SOCIAL FIGURE IS TO SOME EXTENT A MATERIAL INTEREST FOR OTHER MEN'S LOVE OR AVERSION
7139-75360-0036 IS A PRINCIPLE READ INTO THEIR ACTS AND A SOCIAL ANIMAL LIKE MAN IS DEPENDENT ON OTHER MEN'S ACTS FOR HIS HAPPINESS AN INDIVIDUAL'S CONCERN FOR THE ATTITUDE SOCIETY TAKES TOWARD HIM IS THEREFORE
7139-75360-0037 IN THE FIRST INSTANCE CONCERN FOR HIS OWN PRACTICAL WELFARE BUT IMAGINATION HERE REFINES UPON WORLDLY INTEREST WHAT OTHERS THINK OF US WOULD BE OF LITTLE MOMENT DID IT NOT WHEN KNOWN
7139-75360-0038 HE WOULD UTTERLY DESPISE THE IGNORANT NOTIONS OTHERS MIGHT FORM ON A SUBJECT IN WHICH HE HAD SUCH MATCHLESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR OBSERVATION INDEED THOSE OPINIONS WOULD HARDLY SEEM TO HIM DIRECTED UPON THE REALITY AT ALL
7139-75360-0039 AND HE WOULD LAUGH AT THEM AS HE MIGHT AT THE STOCK FORTUNE TELLING OF SOME ITINERANT GYPSY AS IT IS HOWEVER
7139-75360-0040 THEY ARE GREEN AND VIGOROUS IN OLD AGE WE CRAVE SUPPORT IN VANITY AS WE DO IN RELIGION AND NEVER FORGIVE CONTRADICTIONS IN THAT SPHERE FOR HOWEVER PERSISTENT AND PASSIONATE SUCH PREJUDICES MAY BE
7139-75360-0041 WE KNOW TOO WELL THAT THEY ARE WOVEN OF THIN AIR A HOSTILE WORD BY STARTING A CONTRARY IMAGINATIVE CURRENT BUFFETS THEM RUDELY AND THREATENS TO DISSOLVE THEIR BEING
7139-75360-0042 AMBIGUITIES OF FAME THE HIGHEST FORM OF VANITY IS LOVE OF FAME IT IS A PASSION EASY TO DERIDE BUT HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND IN MEN WHO LIVE AT ALL BY IMAGINATION
7139-75360-0043 IN POSTHUMOUS FAME THE DIRECT OBJECT OF THIS PASSION THAT A NAME SHOULD SURVIVE IN MEN'S MOUTHS TO WHICH NO ADEQUATE IDEA OF ITS ORIGINAL CAN BE ATTACHED SEEMS A THIN AND FANTASTIC SATISFACTION ESPECIALLY
7139-75360-0044 WHEN THEY SET SO HIGH A VALUE ON FAME THEY OFTEN IDENTIFIED FAME WITH IMMORTALITY
