3979-10701-0000 HE DISMOUNTED FROM HIS HORSE AND BOWED LOW BEFORE THE HOLY MAN SAYING BY WAY OF GREETING MY FATHER MAY YOUR DAYS BE LONG IN THE LAND AND MAY ALL YOUR WISHES BE FULFILLED THE DERVISH DID HIS BEST TO REPLY
3979-10701-0001 BUT HIS MOUSTACHE WAS SO THICK THAT HIS WORDS WERE HARDLY INTELLIGIBLE AND THE PRINCE PERCEIVING WHAT WAS THE MATTER TOOK A PAIR OF SCISSORS FROM HIS SADDLE POCKETS AND REQUESTED PERMISSION TO CUT OFF SOME OF THE MOUSTACHE AS HE HAD A QUESTION OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO ASK THE DERVISH
3979-10701-0002 THE DERVISH MADE A SIGN THAT HE MIGHT DO AS HE LIKED AND WHEN A FEW INCHES OF HIS HAIR AND BEARD HAD BEEN PRUNED ALL ROUND THE PRINCE ASSURED THE HOLY MAN THAT HE WOULD HARDLY BELIEVE HOW MUCH YOUNGER HE LOOKED THE DERVISH SMILED AT HIS COMPLIMENTS AND THANKED HIM FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE
3979-10701-0003 GENTLE DERVISH REPLIED PRINCE BAHMAN I COME FROM FAR AND I SEEK THE TALKING BIRD THE SINGING TREE AND THE GOLDEN WATER I KNOW THAT THEY ARE TO BE FOUND SOMEWHERE IN THESE PARTS
3979-10701-0004 TELL ME I PRAY YOU IF YOU CAN SO THAT I MAY NOT HAVE TRAVELLED ON A USELESS QUEST WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING THE PRINCE OBSERVED A CHANGE IN THE COUNTENANCE OF THE DERVISH WHO WAITED FOR SOME TIME BEFORE HE MADE REPLY
3979-10701-0005 MY LORD HE SAID AT LAST I DO KNOW THE ROAD FOR WHICH YOU ASK
3979-10701-0006 BUT WHY NOT INQUIRED THE PRINCE WHAT DANGER CAN THERE BE THE VERY GREATEST DANGER ANSWERED THE DERVISH OTHER MEN AS BRAVE AS YOU HAVE RIDDEN DOWN THIS ROAD
3979-10701-0007 I DID MY BEST TO TURN THEM ALSO FROM THEIR PURPOSE BUT IT WAS OF NO USE NOT ONE OF THEM WOULD LISTEN TO MY WORDS AND NOT ONE OF THEM CAME BACK BE WARNED IN TIME AND SEEK TO GO NO FURTHER
3979-10701-0008 I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN ME SAID PRINCE BAHMAN AND FOR THE ADVICE YOU HAVE GIVEN THOUGH I CANNOT FOLLOW IT BUT WHAT DANGERS CAN THERE BE IN THE ADVENTURE WHICH COURAGE AND A GOOD SWORD CANNOT MEET
3979-10701-0009 AND SUPPOSE ANSWERED THE DERVISH THAT YOUR ENEMIES ARE INVISIBLE HOW THEN NOTHING WILL MAKE ME GIVE IT UP REPLIED THE PRINCE AND FOR THE LAST TIME I ASK YOU TO TELL ME WHERE I AM TO GO
3979-10701-0010 IT WILL ROLL ON TILL IT REACHES THE FOOT OF A MOUNTAIN AND WHEN IT STOPS YOU WILL STOP ALSO YOU WILL THEN THROW THE BRIDLE ON YOUR HORSE'S NECK WITHOUT ANY FEAR OF HIS STRAYING AND WILL DISMOUNT
3979-10701-0011 ON EACH SIDE YOU WILL SEE VAST HEAPS OF BIG BLACK STONES AND WILL HEAR A MULTITUDE OF INSULTING VOICES BUT PAY NO HEED TO THEM AND ABOVE ALL BEWARE OF EVER TURNING YOUR HEAD
3979-10701-0012 FOR THOSE STONES ARE IN REALITY MEN LIKE YOURSELF WHO HAVE BEEN ON THE SAME QUEST AND HAVE FAILED AS I FEAR THAT YOU MAY FAIL ALSO IF YOU MANAGE TO AVOID THIS PITFALL AND TO REACH THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN YOU WILL FIND THERE
3979-10701-0013 THE TALKING BIRD IN A SPLENDID CAGE AND YOU CAN ASK OF HIM WHERE YOU ARE TO SEEK THE SINGING TREE AND THE GOLDEN WATER THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO AND WHAT TO AVOID BUT IF YOU ARE WISE YOU WILL THINK OF IT NO MORE BUT RETURN WHENCE YOU HAVE COME
3979-10701-0014 THE PRINCE SMILINGLY SHOOK HIS HEAD AND THANKING THE DERVISH ONCE MORE HE SPRANG ON HIS HORSE AND THREW THE BALL BEFORE HIM THE BALL ROLLED ALONG THE ROAD SO FAST THAT PRINCE BAHMAN HAD MUCH DIFFICULTY IN KEEPING UP WITH IT
3979-10701-0015 AND IT NEVER RELAXED ITS SPEED TILL THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN WAS REACHED THEN IT CAME TO A SUDDEN HALT AND THE PRINCE AT ONCE GOT DOWN AND FLUNG THE BRIDLE ON HIS HORSE'S NECK
3979-10701-0016 HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT AND LOOKED ROUND HIM AT THE MASSES OF BLACK STONES WITH WHICH THE SIDES OF THE MOUNTAIN WERE COVERED AND THEN BEGAN RESOLUTELY TO ASCEND HE HAD HARDLY GONE FOUR STEPS WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES AROUND HIM
3979-10701-0017 HIM AT ONCE KILL HIM SHRIEKED OTHERS
3979-10701-0018 HE IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG MAN I AM SURE THE BIRD AND THE CAGE MUST HAVE BEEN KEPT FOR HIM
3979-10701-0019 BUT CONTINUED TO PRESS FORWARD ON HIS WAY UNFORTUNATELY THIS CONDUCT INSTEAD OF SILENCING THE VOICES ONLY SEEMED TO IRRITATE THEM THE MORE AND THEY AROSE WITH REDOUBLED FURY IN FRONT AS WELL AS BEHIND
3979-10701-0020 AFTER SOME TIME HE GREW BEWILDERED HIS KNEES BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND FINDING HIMSELF IN THE ACT OF FALLING HE FORGOT ALTOGETHER THE ADVICE OF THE DERVISH HE TURNED TO FLY DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AND IN ONE MOMENT BECAME A BLACK STONE
3979-10701-0021 AS MAY BE IMAGINED PRINCE PERVIZ AND HIS SISTER WERE ALL THIS TIME IN THE GREATEST ANXIETY AND CONSULTED THE MAGIC KNIFE NOT ONCE BUT MANY TIMES A DAY HITHERTO THE BLADE HAD REMAINED BRIGHT AND SPOTLESS
3979-10701-0022 AND IT IS I WHO HAVE KILLED YOU FOOL THAT I WAS TO LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THAT TEMPTRESS
3979-10701-0023 PRINCE PERVIZ'S GRIEF AT HIS BROTHER'S LOSS WAS NOT LESS THAN THAT OF PRINCESS PARIZADE BUT HE DID NOT WASTE HIS TIME ON USELESS LAMENTATIONS
3979-10701-0024 AND WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HER OBJECT IN DOING SO
3979-10701-0025 YOU WILL KNOW THAT MY BROTHER'S FATE HAS BEFALLEN ME STILL WE MUST HOPE FOR BETTER LUCK THEN HE DEPARTED AND ON THE TWENTIETH DAY OF HIS JOURNEY FELL IN WITH THE DERVISH ON THE SAME SPOT AS PRINCE BAHMAN HAD MET HIM
3979-10701-0026 AS IN THE CASE OF HIS BROTHER THE DERVISH TRIED TO MAKE HIM GIVE UP HIS PROJECT AND EVEN TOLD HIM THAT ONLY A FEW WEEKS SINCE A YOUNG MAN BEARING A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO HIMSELF HAD PASSED THAT WAY BUT HAD NEVER COME BACK AGAIN
3979-10701-0027 THAT HOLY DERVISH REPLIED PRINCE PERVIZ WAS MY ELDER BROTHER WHO IS NOW DEAD THOUGH HOW HE DIED I CANNOT SAY HE IS CHANGED INTO A BLACK STONE ANSWERED THE DERVISH LIKE ALL THE REST WHO HAVE GONE ON THE SAME ERRAND
3979-10701-0028 AND YOU WILL BECOME ONE LIKEWISE IF YOU ARE NOT MORE CAREFUL IN FOLLOWING MY DIRECTIONS THEN HE CHARGED THE PRINCE AS HE VALUED HIS LIFE TO TAKE NO HEED OF THE CLAMOUR OF VOICES THAT WOULD PURSUE HIM UP THE MOUNTAIN
3979-10701-0029 AND HANDING HIM A BALL FROM THE BAG WHICH STILL SEEMED TO BE HALF FULL HE SENT HIM ON HIS WAY WHEN PRINCE PERVIZ REACHED THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN HE JUMPED FROM HIS HORSE AND PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO RECALL THE INSTRUCTIONS THE DERVISH HAD GIVEN HIM
3979-10701-0030 HE AND HIS HORSE WERE TWO BLACK STONES NOT A MORNING HAD PASSED SINCE PRINCE PERVIZ HAD RIDDEN AWAY WITHOUT PRINCESS PARIZADE TELLING HER BEADS AND AT NIGHT SHE EVEN HUNG THEM ROUND HER NECK SO THAT IF SHE WOKE SHE COULD ASSURE HERSELF AT ONCE OF HER BROTHER'S SAFETY
3979-10701-0031 SHE WAS IN THE VERY ACT OF MOVING THEM THROUGH HER FINGERS AT THE MOMENT THAT THE PRINCE FELL A VICTIM TO HIS IMPATIENCE AND HER HEART SANK WHEN THE FIRST PEARL REMAINED FIXED IN ITS PLACE HOWEVER SHE HAD LONG MADE UP HER MIND
3979-10701-0032 WHAT SHE WOULD DO IN SUCH A CASE AND THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE PRINCESS DISGUISED AS A MAN SET OUT FOR THE MOUNTAIN AS SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RIDING FROM HER CHILDHOOD SHE MANAGED TO TRAVEL AS MANY MILES DAILY AS HER BROTHERS HAD DONE
3979-10701-0033 AND IT WAS AS BEFORE ON THE TWENTIETH DAY THAT SHE ARRIVED AT THE PLACE WHERE THE DERVISH WAS SITTING GOOD DERVISH SHE SAID POLITELY WILL YOU ALLOW ME TO REST BY YOU FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND PERHAPS YOU WILL BE SO KIND AS TO TELL ME IF YOU HAVE EVER HEARD OF A TALKING BIRD
3979-10701-0034 MADAM SAID THE DERVISH THEY ARE FAR MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANY DESCRIPTION BUT YOU SEEM IGNORANT OF ALL THE DIFFICULTIES THAT STAND IN YOUR WAY OR YOU WOULD HARDLY HAVE UNDERTAKEN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
3979-10701-0035 YOU HAVE SPOKEN OF DIFFICULTIES TELL ME I ENTREAT YOU WHAT THEY ARE SO THAT I MAY KNOW IF I CAN OVERCOME THEM OR SEE IF THEY ARE BEYOND MY STRENGTH SO THE DERVISH REPEATED HIS TALE AND DWELT MORE FIRMLY THAN BEFORE
3979-10701-0036 ON THE CLAMOUR OF THE VOICES THE HORRORS OF THE BLACK STONES WHICH WERE ONCE LIVING MEN AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN AND POINTED OUT THAT THE CHIEF MEANS OF SUCCESS WAS NEVER TO LOOK BEHIND TILL YOU HAD THE CAGE IN YOUR GRASP
3979-10701-0037 AS FAR AS I CAN SEE SAID THE PRINCESS THE FIRST THING IS NOT TO MIND THE TUMULT OF THE VOICES THAT FOLLOW YOU TILL YOU REACH THE CAGE AND THEN NEVER TO LOOK BEHIND
3979-10701-0038 BUT AS IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT I MIGHT BE FRIGHTENED BY THE VOICES
3979-10701-0039 LET THEM MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS THEY LIKE I SHALL HEAR NOTHING MADAM CRIED THE DERVISH OUT OF ALL THE NUMBER WHO HAVE ASKED ME THE WAY TO THE MOUNTAIN
3979-10701-0040 BUT ALL THE SAME THE RISK IS GREAT GOOD DERVISH ANSWERED THE PRINCESS I FEEL IN MY HEART THAT I SHALL SUCCEED AND IT ONLY REMAINS FOR ME TO ASK YOU THE WAY I AM TO GO
3979-10701-0041 IN SPITE OF THE COTTON SOME ECHOES OF THE VOICES REACHED HER EARS BUT NOT SO AS TO TROUBLE HER INDEED THOUGH THEY GREW LOUDER AND MORE INSULTING THE HIGHER SHE CLIMBED
3979-10701-0042 THE PRINCESS ONLY LAUGHED AND SAID TO HERSELF THAT SHE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT LET A FEW ROUGH WORDS STAND BETWEEN HER AND THE GOAL AT LAST SHE PERCEIVED IN THE DISTANCE THE CAGE AND THE BIRD WHOSE VOICE JOINED ITSELF IN TONES OF THUNDER TO THOSE OF THE REST
3979-10701-0043 RETURN RETURN NEVER DARE TO COME NEAR ME AT THE SIGHT OF THE BIRD THE PRINCESS HASTENED HER STEPS AND WITHOUT VEXING HERSELF AT THE NOISE WHICH BY THIS TIME HAD GROWN DEAFENING
3979-10701-0044 SHE WALKED STRAIGHT UP TO THE CAGE AND SEIZING IT SHE SAID NOW MY BIRD I HAVE GOT YOU AND I SHALL TAKE GOOD CARE THAT YOU DO NOT ESCAPE AS SHE SPOKE SHE TOOK THE COTTON FROM HER EARS FOR IT WAS NEEDED NO LONGER
3979-10701-0045 SOME DAY YOU WILL PUT ME TO THE PROOF FOR I KNOW WHO YOU ARE BETTER THAN YOU DO YOURSELF MEANWHILE TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO AND I WILL OBEY YOU BIRD REPLIED THE PRINCESS WHO WAS
3979-10701-0046 FILLED WITH A JOY THAT SEEMED STRANGE TO HERSELF WHEN SHE THOUGHT THAT THE BIRD HAD COST HER THE LIVES OF BOTH HER BROTHERS BIRD LET ME FIRST THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD WILL AND THEN LET ME ASK YOU WHERE THE GOLDEN WATER IS TO BE FOUND
3979-10701-0047 THE BIRD DESCRIBED THE PLACE WHICH WAS NOT FAR DISTANT AND THE PRINCESS FILLED A SMALL SILVER FLASK THAT SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER FOR THE PURPOSE SHE THEN RETURNED TO THE CAGE AND SAID BIRD THERE IS STILL SOMETHING ELSE WHERE SHALL I FIND THE SINGING TREE
3979-10701-0048 BEHIND YOU IN THAT WOOD REPLIED THE BIRD AND THE PRINCESS WANDERED THROUGH THE WOOD TILL A SOUND OF THE SWEETEST VOICES TOLD HER SHE HAD FOUND WHAT SHE SOUGHT BUT THE TREE WAS TALL AND STRONG AND IT WAS HOPELESS TO THINK OF UPROOTING IT
3979-10701-0049 WHEN THE PRINCESS PARIZADE HELD IN HER HANDS THE THREE WONDERS PROMISED HER BY THE OLD WOMAN SHE SAID TO THE BIRD ALL THAT IS NOT ENOUGH IT WAS OWING TO YOU THAT MY BROTHERS BECAME BLACK STONES I CANNOT TELL THEM FROM THE MASS OF OTHERS BUT YOU MUST KNOW
3979-10701-0050 AND POINT THEM OUT TO ME I BEG YOU FOR I WISH TO CARRY THEM AWAY FOR SOME REASON THAT THE PRINCESS COULD NOT GUESS THESE WORDS SEEMED TO DISPLEASE THE BIRD AND HE DID NOT ANSWER THE PRINCESS WAITED A MOMENT AND THEN CONTINUED IN SEVERE TONES
3979-10701-0051 HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT YOU YOURSELF SAID THAT YOU ARE MY SLAVE TO DO MY BIDDING AND ALSO THAT YOUR LIFE IS IN MY POWER NO I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN REPLIED THE BIRD BUT WHAT YOU ASK IS VERY DIFFICULT HOWEVER I WILL DO MY BEST
3979-10701-0052 IF YOU LOOK ROUND HE WENT ON YOU WILL SEE A PITCHER STANDING NEAR TAKE IT AND AS YOU GO DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SCATTER A LITTLE OF THE WATER IT CONTAINS OVER EVERY BLACK STONE AND YOU WILL SOON FIND YOUR TWO BROTHERS
3979-10701-0053 PRINCESS PARIZADE TOOK THE PITCHER AND CARRYING WITH HER BESIDES THE CAGE THE TWIG AND THE FLASK RETURNED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AT EVERY BLACK STONE SHE STOPPED AND SPRINKLED IT WITH WATER
3979-10701-0054 AND THE BLACK STONES THAT WERE HEAPED UP ALONG THE ROAD LOOK ROUND AND SEE IF THERE IS ONE LEFT THESE GENTLEMEN AND YOURSELVES AND ALL YOUR HORSES WERE CHANGED INTO THESE STONES AND I HAVE DELIVERED YOU BY SPRINKLING YOU WITH THE WATER FROM THIS PITCHER
3979-10701-0055 AS I COULD NOT RETURN HOME WITHOUT YOU EVEN THOUGH I HAD GAINED THE PRIZES ON WHICH I HAD SET MY HEART I FORCED THE TALKING BIRD TO TELL ME HOW TO BREAK THE SPELL ON HEARING THESE WORDS PRINCE BAHMAN AND PRINCE PERVIZ UNDERSTOOD ALL THEY OWED THEIR SISTER
3979-10701-0056 AND THE KNIGHTS WHO STOOD BY DECLARED THEMSELVES HER SLAVES AND READY TO CARRY OUT HER WISHES BUT THE PRINCESS WHILE THANKING THEM FOR THEIR POLITENESS EXPLAINED THAT SHE WISHED FOR NO COMPANY BUT THAT OF HER BROTHERS
3979-10701-0057 BUT THEY FOUND TO THEIR SORROW THAT HE WAS DEAD WHETHER FROM OLD AGE OR WHETHER FROM THE FEELING THAT HIS TASK WAS DONE THEY NEVER KNEW AS THEY CONTINUED THEIR ROAD THEIR NUMBERS GREW DAILY SMALLER FOR THE KNIGHTS TURNED OFF ONE BY ONE TO THEIR OWN HOMES
3979-10701-0058 THE PRINCESS CARRIED THE CAGE STRAIGHT INTO THE GARDEN AND AS SOON AS THE BIRD BEGAN TO SING NIGHTINGALES LARKS THRUSHES FINCHES AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER BIRDS MINGLED THEIR VOICES IN CHORUS THE BRANCH SHE PLANTED IN A CORNER NEAR THE HOUSE
3979-10701-0059 AS FOR THE GOLDEN WATER IT WAS POURED INTO A GREAT MARBLE BASIN SPECIALLY PREPARED FOR IT AND IT SWELLED AND BUBBLED AND THEN SHOT UP INTO THE AIR IN A FOUNTAIN TWENTY FEET HIGH THE FAME OF THESE WONDERS SOON SPREAD ABROAD
3979-10701-0060 AND PEOPLE CAME FROM FAR AND NEAR TO SEE AND ADMIRE AFTER A FEW DAYS PRINCE BAHMAN AND PRINCE PERVIZ FELL BACK INTO THEIR ORDINARY WAY OF LIFE AND PASSED MOST OF THEIR TIME HUNTING ONE DAY IT HAPPENED THAT THE SULTAN OF PERSIA WAS ALSO HUNTING IN THE SAME DIRECTION
