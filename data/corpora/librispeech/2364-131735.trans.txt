2364-131735-0000 EDISON'S WORK IN STOCK PRINTERS AND TELEGRAPHY HAD MARKED HIM AS A RISING MAN IN THE ELECTRICAL ART OF THE PERIOD BUT HIS INVENTION OF QUADRUPLEX TELEGRAPHY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
2364-131735-0001 WAS WHAT BROUGHT HIM VERY PROMINENTLY BEFORE THE NOTICE OF THE PUBLIC DUPLEX TELEGRAPHY OR THE SENDING OF TWO SEPARATE MESSAGES IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AT THE SAME TIME OVER ONE LINE WAS KNOWN AND PRACTICED PREVIOUS TO THIS TIME
2364-131735-0002 BUT QUADRUPLEX TELEGRAPHY OR THE SIMULTANEOUS SENDING OF FOUR SEPARATE MESSAGES TWO IN EACH DIRECTION OVER A SINGLE LINE HAD NOT BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MANY AN INVENTOR'S DREAM
2364-131735-0003 AND THE OBJECT OF ANXIOUS EFFORTS FOR MANY LONG YEARS IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE AND FOR SOME TIME AFTERWARD THE SYSTEM INVENTED BY JOSEPH STEARNS WAS THE DUPLEX IN PRACTICAL USE
2364-131735-0004 IN APRIL OF THAT YEAR HOWEVER EDISON TOOK UP THE STUDY OF THE SUBJECT AND FILED TWO APPLICATIONS FOR PATENTS
2364-131735-0005 NOT ONLY DUPLEX OR IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AS ABOVE EXPLAINED BUT COULD ALSO BE SENT DIPLEX THAT IS TO SAY IN ONE DIRECTION SIMULTANEOUSLY AS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT MESSAGES OVER THE ONE LINE
2364-131735-0006 THUS THERE WAS INTRODUCED A NEW FEATURE INTO THE ART OF MULTIPLEX TELEGRAPHY FOR WHEREAS DUPLEXING ACCOMPLISHED BY VARYING THE STRENGTH OF THE CURRENT PERMITTED MESSAGES TO BE SENT SIMULTANEOUSLY FROM OPPOSITE STATIONS
2364-131735-0007 AND THEREBY PRODUCED A SYSTEM BY MEANS OF WHICH FOUR MESSAGES COULD BE SENT OVER A SINGLE LINE AT THE SAME TIME TWO IN EACH DIRECTION
2364-131735-0008 AS THE READER WILL PROBABLY BE INTERESTED TO LEARN SOMETHING OF THE THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES OF THIS FASCINATING INVENTION WE SHALL ENDEAVOR TO OFFER A BRIEF AND CONDENSED EXPLANATION THEREOF
2364-131735-0009 WITH AS LITTLE TECHNICALITY AS THE SUBJECT WILL PERMIT THIS EXPLANATION WILL NECESSARILY BE OF SOMEWHAT ELEMENTARY CHARACTER FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE LAY READER WHOSE INDULGENCE IS ASKED FOR AN OCCASIONAL REITERATION
2364-131735-0010 INTRODUCED FOR THE SAKE OF CLEARNESS OF COMPREHENSION WHILE THE APPARATUS AND THE CIRCUITS
2364-131735-0011 SEEMINGLY VERY INTRICATE THE PRINCIPLES ARE REALLY QUITE SIMPLE AND THE DIFFICULTY OF COMPREHENSION IS MORE APPARENT THAN REAL IF THE UNDERLYING PHENOMENA ARE STUDIED ATTENTIVELY
2364-131735-0012 AT THE ROOT OF ALL SYSTEMS OF TELEGRAPHY INCLUDING MULTIPLEX SYSTEMS THERE LIES THE SINGLE BASIC PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH THEIR PERFORMANCE DEPENDS NAMELY THE OBTAINING OF A SLIGHT MECHANICAL MOVEMENT
2364-131735-0013 AT THE MORE OR LESS DISTANT END OF A TELEGRAPH LINE THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE UTILIZATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF ELECTROMAGNETISM THESE PHENOMENA ARE EASY OF COMPREHENSION AND DEMONSTRATION
2364-131735-0014 IF A ROD OF SOFT IRON BE WOUND AROUND WITH A NUMBER OF TURNS OF INSULATED WIRE AND A CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY BE SENT THROUGH THE WIRE THE ROD WILL BE INSTANTLY MAGNETIZED AND WILL REMAIN A MAGNET AS LONG AS THE CURRENT FLOWS
2364-131735-0015 BUT WHEN THE CURRENT IS CUT OFF THE MAGNETIC EFFECT INSTANTLY CEASES THIS DEVICE IS KNOWN AS AN ELECTROMAGNET AND THE CHARGING AND DISCHARGING OF SUCH A MAGNET MAY OF COURSE BE REPEATED INDEFINITELY
2364-131735-0016 TO ITSELF PIECES OF IRON OR STEEL THE BASIC IMPORTANCE OF AN ELECTROMAGNET IN TELEGRAPHY WILL BE AT ONCE APPARENT WHEN WE CONSIDER THE SOUNDER WHOSE CLICKS ARE FAMILIAR TO EVERY EAR
2364-131735-0017 THIS INSTRUMENT CONSISTS ESSENTIALLY OF AN ELECTRO MAGNET OF HORSESHOE FORM WITH ITS TWO POLES CLOSE TOGETHER AND WITH ITS ARMATURE A BAR OF IRON
2364-131735-0018 MAINTAINED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE POLES BUT KEPT NORMALLY IN A RETRACTED POSITION BY A SPRING WHEN THE DISTANT OPERATOR PRESSES DOWN HIS KEY THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED AND A CURRENT PASSES ALONG THE LINE
2364-131735-0019 AND THROUGH THE GENERALLY TWO COILS OF THE ELECTROMAGNET THUS MAGNETIZING THE IRON CORE ITS ATTRACTIVE POWER DRAWS THE ARMATURE TOWARD THE POLES WHEN THE OPERATOR RELEASES THE PRESSURE ON HIS KEY THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN
2364-131735-0020 CURRENT DOES NOT FLOW THE MAGNETIC EFFECT CEASES AND THE ARMATURE IS DRAWN BACK BY ITS SPRING THESE MOVEMENTS GIVE RISE TO THE CLICKING SOUNDS WHICH REPRESENT THE DOTS AND DASHES OF THE MORSE OR OTHER ALPHABET
2364-131735-0021 AS TRANSMITTED BY THE OPERATOR SIMILAR MOVEMENTS PRODUCED IN LIKE MANNER ARE AVAILED OF IN ANOTHER INSTRUMENT KNOWN AS THE RELAY WHOSE OFFICE IS TO ACT PRACTICALLY AS AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMITTER KEY
2364-131735-0022 REPEATING THE MESSAGES RECEIVED IN ITS COILS
2364-131735-0023 EQUIPPED WITH ITS OWN BATTERY OR WHEN THE MESSAGE IS INTENDED FOR ITS OWN STATION SENDING THE MESSAGE TO AN ADJACENT SOUNDER INCLUDED IN A LOCAL BATTERY CIRCUIT
2364-131735-0024 WITH A SIMPLE CIRCUIT THEREFORE BETWEEN TWO STATIONS AND WHERE AN INTERMEDIATE BATTERY IS NOT NECESSARY A RELAY IS NOT USED PASSING ON TO THE CONSIDERATION OF ANOTHER PHASE OF THE PHENOMENA OF ELECTROMAGNETISM
2364-131735-0025 IN WHICH WILL BE SEEN ON THE LEFT A SIMPLE FORM OF ELECTROMAGNET CONSISTING OF A BAR OF SOFT IRON WOUND AROUND WITH INSULATED WIRE THROUGH WHICH A CURRENT IS FLOWING FROM A BATTERY
2364-131735-0026 THE ARROWS INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF FLOW ALL MAGNETS HAVE TWO POLES NORTH AND SOUTH A PERMANENT MAGNET MADE OF STEEL WHICH AS DISTINGUISHED FROM SOFT IRON RETAINS ITS MAGNETISM FOR LONG PERIODS
2364-131735-0027 AND ITS POLARITY REMAINS FIXED
2364-131735-0028 AND THE POLARITY OF THE SOFT IRON BAR IS DETERMINED BY THE DIRECTION OF FLOW OF CURRENT AROUND IT FOR THE TIME BEING IF THE DIRECTION IS REVERSED THE POLARITY WILL ALSO BE REVERSED
2364-131735-0029 ASSUMING FOR INSTANCE THE BAR TO BE END ON TOWARD THE OBSERVER THAT END WILL BE A SOUTH POLE IF THE CURRENT IS FLOWING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT CLOCKWISE AROUND THE BAR
2364-131735-0030 OR A NORTH POLE IF FLOWING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION AS ILLUSTRATED AT THE RIGHT OF THE FIGURE
2364-131735-0031 THE DETERMINING FACTOR OF POLARITY BEING THE DIRECTION OF THE CURRENT
2364-131735-0032 THEY WILL TEND TO PRODUCE EXACTLY OPPOSITE POLARITIES AND THUS NEUTRALIZE EACH OTHER HENCE THE BAR WOULD REMAIN NON MAGNETIC AS THE PATH TO THE QUADRUPLEX PASSES THROUGH THE DUPLEX
2364-131735-0033 LET US CONSIDER THE STEARNS SYSTEM AFTER NOTING ONE OTHER PRINCIPLE NAMELY THAT IF MORE THAN ONE PATH IS PRESENTED IN WHICH AN ELECTRIC CURRENT MAY COMPLETE ITS CIRCUIT IT DIVIDES IN PROPORTION TO THE RESISTANCE OF EACH PATH
2364-131735-0034 HENCE IF WE CONNECT ONE POLE OF A BATTERY WITH THE EARTH AND FROM THE OTHER POLE
2364-131735-0035 EQUAL CURRENTS WILL TRAVERSE THE WIRES
2364-131735-0036 IS LED FROM A BATTERY AROUND A BAR OF SOFT IRON FROM LEFT TO RIGHT AND ANOTHER WIRE OF EQUAL RESISTANCE AND EQUAL NUMBER OF TURNS B AROUND FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
2364-131735-0037 THE FLOW OF CURRENT WILL CAUSE TWO EQUAL OPPOSING ACTIONS TO BE SET UP IN THE BAR ONE WILL EXACTLY OFFSET THE OTHER AND NO MAGNETIC EFFECT WILL BE PRODUCED A RELAY THUS WOUND IS KNOWN AS A DIFFERENTIAL RELAY
2364-131735-0038 MORE GENERALLY CALLED A NEUTRAL RELAY THE NON TECHNICAL READER MAY WONDER WHAT USE CAN POSSIBLY BE MADE OF AN APPARENTLY NON OPERATIVE PIECE OF APPARATUS IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND HOWEVER IN CONSIDERING A DUPLEX SYSTEM
2364-131735-0039 THAT A DIFFERENTIAL RELAY IS USED AT EACH END OF THE LINE AND FORMS PART OF THE CIRCUIT AND THAT WHILE EACH RELAY MUST BE ABSOLUTELY UNRESPONSIVE TO THE SIGNALS
2364-131735-0040 SENT OUT FROM ITS HOME OFFICE IT MUST RESPOND TO SIGNALS TRANSMITTED BY A DISTANT OFFICE HENCE THE NEXT FIGURE FOUR WITH ITS ACCOMPANYING EXPLANATION WILL PROBABLY MAKE THE MATTER CLEAR
2364-131735-0041 IF ANOTHER BATTERY D BE INTRODUCED AT THE DISTANT END OF THE WIRE A THE DIFFERENTIAL OR NEUTRAL RELAY BECOMES ACTIVELY OPERATIVE AS FOLLOWS
2364-131735-0042 THE DISTANT STATION TO WHICH A MESSAGE IS TO BE SENT THE RELAY AT EACH END HAS TWO COILS ONE AND TWO
2364-131735-0043 THE LATTER IN EACH CASE HAS IN ITS CIRCUIT A RESISTANCE R TO COMPENSATE FOR THE RESISTANCE OF THE MAIN LINE SO THAT THERE SHALL BE NO INEQUALITIES IN THE CIRCUITS THE ARTIFICIAL LINE AS WELL AS THAT TO WHICH THE TWO COILS ARE JOINED
2364-131735-0044 ARE CONNECTED TO EARTH THERE IS A BATTERY C AND A KEY K WHEN THE KEY IS DEPRESSED CURRENT FLOWS THROUGH THE RELAY COILS AT A BUT NO MAGNETISM IS PRODUCED AS THEY OPPOSE EACH OTHER
2364-131735-0045 THE CURRENT HOWEVER FLOWS OUT THROUGH THE MAIN LINE COIL OVER THE LINE AND THROUGH THE MAIN LINE COIL ONE AT B COMPLETING ITS CIRCUIT TO EARTH AND MAGNETIZING THE BAR OF THE RELAY THUS CAUSING ITS ARMATURE TO BE ATTRACTED
2364-131735-0046 ON RELEASING THE KEY THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN AND MAGNETISM INSTANTLY CEASES IT WILL BE EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE OPERATOR AT A MAY CAUSE THE RELAY AT B
2364-131735-0047 SIMILAR EFFECTS WOULD BE PRODUCED FROM B TO A IF THE BATTERY AND KEY WERE PLACED AT THE B END
2364-131735-0048 WE HAVE A DIFFERENTIAL DUPLEX ARRANGEMENT BY MEANS OF WHICH TWO OPERATORS MAY ACTUATE RELAYS AT THE ENDS DISTANT FROM THEM WITHOUT CAUSING THE OPERATION OF THE RELAYS AT THEIR HOME ENDS
2364-131735-0049 IN PRACTICE THIS IS DONE BY MEANS OF A SPECIAL INSTRUMENT KNOWN AS A CONTINUITY PRESERVING TRANSMITTER OR USUALLY AS A TRANSMITTER THIS CONSISTS OF AN ELECTROMAGNET T OPERATED BY A KEY K
2364-131735-0050 AND SEPARATE BATTERY THE ARMATURE LEVER L IS LONG PIVOTED IN THE CENTRE AND IS BENT OVER AT THE END
2364-131735-0051 AT A POINT A LITTLE BEYOND ITS CENTRE IS A SMALL PIECE OF INSULATING MATERIAL TO WHICH IS SCREWED A STRIP OF SPRING METAL S CONVENIENTLY PLACED WITH REFERENCE TO THE END OF THE LEVER IS A BENT METALLIC PIECE P
2364-131735-0052 AND ATTACHED TO THE LOWER END OF THIS BENT PIECE IS A POST OR STANDARD TO WHICH THE MAIN BATTERY IS ELECTRICALLY CONNECTED
2364-131735-0053 THE RELAY COILS ARE CONNECTED BY WIRE TO THE SPRING PIECE S AND THE ARMATURE LEVER IS CONNECTED TO EARTH IF THE KEY IS DEPRESSED THE ARMATURE IS ATTRACTED AND ITS BENT END IS MOVED UPWARD
2364-131735-0054 DEPRESSING THE SPRING WHICH MAKES CONTACT WITH THE UPPER SCREW WHICH PLACES THE BATTERY TO THE LINE AND SIMULTANEOUSLY BREAKS THE GROUND CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SPRING AND THE UPTURNED END OF THE LEVER
2364-131735-0055 WHEN THE KEY IS RELEASED THE BATTERY IS AGAIN CONNECTED TO EARTH THE COMPENSATING RESISTANCES AND CONDENSERS NECESSARY FOR A DUPLEX ARRANGEMENT ARE SHOWN IN THE DIAGRAM
2364-131735-0056 CURRENT FLOWS VIA POST P THROUGH S AND TO BOTH RELAY COILS AT A THENCE OVER THE MAIN LINE TO MAIN LINE COIL AT B
2364-131735-0057 AND DOWN TO EARTH THROUGH S AND THE ARMATURE LEVER WITH ITS GROUNDED WIRE THE RELAY AT A WOULD BE UNRESPONSIVE BUT THE CORE OF THE RELAY AT B WOULD BE MAGNETIZED AND ITS ARMATURE RESPOND TO SIGNALS FROM A
2364-131735-0058 IN LIKE MANNER IF THE TRANSMITTER AT B BE CLOSED CURRENT WOULD FLOW THROUGH SIMILAR PARTS AND THUS CAUSE THE RELAY AT A TO RESPOND IF BOTH TRANSMITTERS BE CLOSED SIMULTANEOUSLY BOTH BATTERIES WILL BE PLACED TO THE LINE
2364-131735-0059 WHICH WOULD PRACTICALLY RESULT IN DOUBLING THE CURRENT IN EACH OF THE MAIN LINE COILS IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH BOTH RELAYS ARE ENERGIZED AND THEIR ARMATURES ATTRACTED THROUGH THE OPERATION OF THE KEYS AT THE DISTANT ENDS
2364-131735-0060 HENCE TWO MESSAGES CAN BE SENT IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS OVER THE SAME LINE SIMULTANEOUSLY THE READER WILL UNDOUBTEDLY SEE QUITE CLEARLY FROM THE ABOVE SYSTEM WHICH RESTS UPON VARYING THE STRENGTH OF THE CURRENT
2364-131735-0061 TO ACCOMPLISH THIS OBJECT EDISON INTRODUCED ANOTHER AND DISTINCT FEATURE NAMELY THE USING OF THE SAME CURRENT BUT ALSO VARYING ITS DIRECTION OF FLOW THAT IS TO SAY ALTERNATELY REVERSING THE POLARITY OF THE BATTERIES
2364-131735-0062 AS APPLIED TO THE LINE AND THUS PRODUCING CORRESPONDING CHANGES IN THE POLARITY OF ANOTHER SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED TYPE OF RELAY CALLED A POLARIZED RELAY
2364-131735-0063 AND ITS EXPLANATION FROM WHICH IT APPEARS THAT THE POLARITY OF A SOFT IRON BAR IS DETERMINED NOT BY THE STRENGTH OF THE CURRENT FLOWING AROUND IT BUT BY THE DIRECTION THEREOF WITH THIS IDEA CLEARLY IN MIND
2364-131735-0064 THE THEORY OF THE POLARIZED RELAY GENERALLY CALLED POLAR
2364-131735-0065 WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD
2364-131735-0066 THE ENDS OF WHICH ARE CONNECTED WITH A BATTERY B THUS FORMING AN ELECTROMAGNET AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS RELAY CONSISTS OF A SWINGING PERMANENT MAGNET C WHOSE POLARITY REMAINS FIXED
2364-131735-0067 THAT END BETWEEN THE TERMINALS OF THE ELECTROMAGNET BEING A NORTH POLE INASMUCH AS UNLIKE POLES OF MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTED TO EACH OTHER AND LIKE POLES REPELLED
2364-131735-0068 IT FOLLOWS THAT THIS NORTH POLE WILL BE REPELLED BY THE NORTH POLE OF THE ELECTROMAGNET BUT WILL SWING OVER AND BE ATTRACTED BY ITS SOUTH POLE IF THE DIRECTION OF FLOW OF CURRENT BE REVERSED BY REVERSING THE BATTERY
2364-131735-0069 THE ELECTROMAGNETIC POLARITY ALSO REVERSES AND THE END OF THE PERMANENT MAGNET SWINGS OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE
2364-131735-0070 THIS DEVICE BEING A RELAY ITS PURPOSE IS TO REPEAT TRANSMITTED SIGNALS INTO A LOCAL CIRCUIT AS BEFORE EXPLAINED FOR THIS PURPOSE THERE ARE PROVIDED AT D AND E
2364-131735-0071 A CONTACT AND A BACK STOP THE FORMER OF WHICH IS OPENED AND CLOSED BY THE SWINGING PERMANENT MAGNET THUS OPENING AND CLOSING THE LOCAL CIRCUIT
2364-131735-0072 MANIFESTLY THERE MUST BE PROVIDED SOME CONVENIENT WAY FOR RAPIDLY TRANSPOSING THE DIRECTION OF THE CURRENT FLOW IF SUCH A DEVICE AS THE POLAR RELAY IS TO BE USED FOR THE RECEPTION OF TELEGRAPH MESSAGES
2364-131735-0073 AND THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY MEANS OF AN INSTRUMENT CALLED A POLE CHANGER WHICH CONSISTS ESSENTIALLY OF A MOVABLE CONTACT PIECE CONNECTED PERMANENTLY TO THE EARTH OR GROUNDED AND ARRANGED TO CONNECT ONE
2364-131735-0074 OR THE OTHER POLE OF A BATTERY TO THE LINE AND SIMULTANEOUSLY GROUND THE OTHER POLE THIS ACTION OF THE POLE CHANGER IS EFFECTED BY MOVEMENTS OF THE ARMATURE OF AN ELECTROMAGNET THROUGH THE MANIPULATION OF AN ORDINARY TELEGRAPH KEY
2364-131735-0075 BY AN OPERATOR AT THE HOME STATION AS IN THE OPERATION OF THE TRANSMITTER ABOVE REFERRED TO BY A COMBINATION OF THE NEUTRAL RELAY AND THE POLAR RELAY TWO OPERATORS BY MANIPULATING TWO TELEGRAPH KEYS
2364-131735-0076 IN THE ORDINARY WAY CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY SEND TWO MESSAGES OVER ONE LINE IN THE SAME DIRECTION WITH THE SAME CURRENT ONE OPERATOR VARYING ITS STRENGTH AND THE OTHER OPERATOR VARYING ITS POLARITY OR DIRECTION OF FLOW
2364-131735-0077 ALTHOUGH IN THE PATENT REFERRED TO EDISON SHOWED AND CLAIMED THE ADAPTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE TO DUPLEX TELEGRAPHY INDEED AS A MATTER OF FACT IT WAS FOUND THAT BY WINDING THE POLAR RELAY DIFFERENTIALLY
2364-131735-0078 AND ARRANGING THE CIRCUITS AND COLLATERAL APPLIANCES APPROPRIATELY THE POLAR DUPLEX SYSTEM WAS MORE HIGHLY EFFICIENT THAN THE NEUTRAL SYSTEM AND IT IS EXTENSIVELY USED TO THE PRESENT DAY
2364-131735-0079 THUS FAR WE HAVE REFERRED TO TWO SYSTEMS ONE THE NEUTRAL OR DIFFERENTIAL DUPLEX
2364-131735-0080 BY ONE OF THESE TWO SYSTEMS A SINGLE WIRE COULD BE USED FOR SENDING TWO MESSAGES IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AND BY THE OTHER IN THE SAME DIRECTION OR IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
2364-131735-0081 TWO IN EACH DIRECTION THUS EMPLOYING EIGHT OPERATORS FOUR AT EACH END TWO SENDING AND TWO RECEIVING
2364-131735-0082 THE EQUIPMENT OF SUCH A SYSTEM AT EACH END OF THE LINE CONSISTS OF THESE TWO INSTRUMENTS TOGETHER WITH THE SPECIAL FORM OF TRANSMITTER AND THE POLE CHANGER AND THEIR KEYS FOR ACTUATING THE NEUTRAL AND POLAR RELAYS AT THE OTHER OR DISTANT END
2364-131735-0083 COMPENSATING RESISTANCES AND CONDENSERS
2364-131735-0084 IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD OF COURSE THAT THE POLAR RELAY AS USED IN THE QUADRUPLEX SYSTEM IS WOUND DIFFERENTIALLY AND THEREFORE ITS OPERATION IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR IN PRINCIPLE TO THAT OF THE DIFFERENTIALLY WOUND NEUTRAL RELAY
2364-131735-0085 IN THAT IT DOES NOT RESPOND TO THE OPERATION OF THE KEY AT THE HOME OFFICE BUT ONLY OPERATES IN RESPONSE TO THE MOVEMENTS OF THE DISTANT KEY
2364-131735-0086 OUR EXPLANATION HAS MERELY AIMED TO SHOW THE UNDERLYING PHENOMENA AND PRINCIPLES IN BROAD OUTLINE WITHOUT ENTERING INTO MORE DETAIL THAN WAS DEEMED ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
2364-131735-0087 IT SHOULD BE STATED HOWEVER THAT BETWEEN THE OUTLINE AND THE FILLING IN OF THE DETAILS THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF HARD WORK STUDY PATIENT PLODDING AND ENDLESS EXPERIMENTS BEFORE EDISON FINALLY PERFECTED HIS QUADRUPLEX SYSTEM
2364-131735-0088 IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR IF IT WERE ATTEMPTED TO OFFER HERE A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE VARIED AND NUMEROUS OPERATIONS OF THE QUADRUPLEX THIS ARTICLE WOULD ASSUME THE PROPORTIONS OF A TREATISE
2364-131735-0089 AN IDEA OF THEIR COMPLEXITY MAY BE GATHERED FROM THE FOLLOWING WHICH IS QUOTED FROM AMERICAN TELEGRAPHY AND ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE TELEGRAPH
2364-131735-0090 SO QUICKLY MADE BROKEN UP AND OTHERS REFORMED AS IN THE OPERATION OF THE EDISON QUADRUPLEX FOR EXAMPLE IT IS QUITE DEMONSTRABLE THAT DURING THE MAKING OF A SIMPLE DASH OF THE MORSE ALPHABET BY THE NEUTRAL RELAY AT THE HOME STATION
2364-131735-0091 THE DISTANT POLE CHANGER MAY REVERSE ITS BATTERY SEVERAL TIMES THE HOME POLE CHANGER MAY DO LIKEWISE AND THE HOME TRANSMITTER MAY INCREASE AND DECREASE THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE OF THE HOME BATTERY REPEATEDLY
2364-131735-0092 SIMULTANEOUSLY AND OF COURSE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE FOREGOING ACTIONS THE HOME NEUTRAL RELAY ITSELF MAY HAVE HAD ITS MAGNETISM REVERSED SEVERAL TIMES AND THE SIGNAL THAT IS THE DASH WILL HAVE BEEN MADE
2364-131735-0093 PARTLY BY THE HOME BATTERY PARTLY BY THE DISTANT AND HOME BATTERIES COMBINED PARTLY BY CURRENT ON THE MAIN LINE
2364-131735-0094 PARTLY BY THE MAIN LINE STATIC CURRENT PARTLY BY THE CONDENSER STATIC CURRENT AND YET ON A WELL ADJUSTED CIRCUIT THE DASH WILL HAVE BEEN PRODUCED ON THE QUADRUPLEX SOUNDER AS CLEARLY AS ANY DASH ON AN ORDINARY SINGLE WIRE SOUNDER
2364-131735-0095 AND REFER THE READER TO THE ABOVE OR OTHER TEXT BOOKS IF HE DESIRES TO MAKE A CLOSE STUDY OF ITS INTRICATE OPERATIONS BEFORE FINALLY DISMISSING THE QUADRUPLEX AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE INQUIRING READER
2364-131735-0096 A HINT AS TO AN ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NEUTRAL RELAY AS USED IN THE DUPLEX AND AS USED IN THE QUADRUPLEX MAY BE GIVEN
2364-131735-0097 WITH THE DUPLEX AS WE HAVE SEEN THE CURRENT ON THE MAIN LINE IS CHANGED IN STRENGTH ONLY WHEN BOTH KEYS AT OPPOSITE STATIONS ARE CLOSED TOGETHER SO THAT A CURRENT DUE TO BOTH BATTERIES FLOWS OVER THE MAIN LINE
2364-131735-0098 WHEN A SINGLE MESSAGE IS SENT FROM ONE STATION TO THE OTHER OR WHEN BOTH STATIONS ARE SENDING MESSAGES THAT DO NOT CONFLICT ONLY ONE BATTERY OR THE OTHER IS CONNECTED TO THE MAIN LINE BUT WITH THE QUADRUPLEX
2364-131735-0099 SUPPOSE ONE OF THE OPERATORS IN NEW YORK FOR INSTANCE IS SENDING REVERSALS OF CURRENT TO CHICAGO WE CAN READILY SEE HOW THESE CHANGES IN POLARITY WILL OPERATE THE POLAR RELAY AT THE DISTANT STATION
2364-131735-0100 BUT WHY WILL THEY NOT ALSO OPERATE THE NEUTRAL RELAY AT THE DISTANT STATION AS WELL THIS DIFFICULTY WAS SOLVED BY DIVIDING THE BATTERY AT EACH STATION INTO TWO UNEQUAL PARTS
2364-131735-0101 THE SMALLER BATTERY BEING ALWAYS IN CIRCUIT WITH THE POLE CHANGER READY TO HAVE ITS POLARITY REVERSED ON THE MAIN LINE TO OPERATE THE DISTANT POLAR RELAY BUT THE SPRING RETRACTING THE ARMATURE OF THE NEUTRAL RELAY
2364-131735-0102 IS MADE SO STIFF AS TO RESIST THESE WEAK CURRENTS IF HOWEVER THE TRANSMITTER IS OPERATED AT THE SAME END THE ENTIRE BATTERY IS CONNECTED TO THE MAIN LINE AND THE STRENGTH OF THIS CURRENT IS SUFFICIENT TO OPERATE THE NEUTRAL RELAY
2364-131735-0103 THE CURRENT SO VARIED IN STRENGTH IS SUBJECT TO REVERSAL OF POLARITY BY THE POLE CHANGER BUT THE VARIATIONS IN STRENGTH HAVE NO EFFECT UPON THE DISTANT POLAR RELAY BECAUSE THAT RELAY BEING RESPONSIVE TO CHANGES IN POLARITY OF A WEAK CURRENT
2364-131735-0104 IS OBVIOUSLY RESPONSIVE TO CORRESPONDING CHANGES IN POLARITY OF A POWERFUL CURRENT
2364-131735-0105 BEARING ALWAYS IN MIND THAT BY REASON OF THE DIFFERENTIAL WINDING OF THE POLAR AND NEUTRAL RELAYS NEITHER OF THE RELAYS AT ONE STATION WILL RESPOND TO THE HOME BATTERY AND CAN ONLY RESPOND TO THE DISTANT BATTERY
2364-131735-0106 THE POLAR RELAY RESPONDING WHEN THE POLARITY OF THE CURRENT IS REVERSED WHETHER THE CURRENT BE STRONG OR WEAK AND THE NEUTRAL RELAY RESPONDING WHEN THE LINE CURRENT IS INCREASED REGARDLESS OF ITS POLARITY
2364-131735-0107 THE QUADRUPLEX WAS ALSO ARRANGED TO OPERATE ON THE WHEATSTONE BRIDGE PRINCIPLE
2364-131735-0108 IN A RAILROAD SYSTEM THERE ARE USUALLY TWO TERMINAL STATIONS AND A NUMBER OF WAY STATIONS THERE IS NATURALLY MUCH INTERCOMMUNICATION WHICH WOULD BE GREATLY CURTAILED BY A SYSTEM HAVING THE CAPACITY OF ONLY A SINGLE MESSAGE AT A TIME
2364-131735-0109 THE DUPLEXES ABOVE DESCRIBED COULD NOT BE USED ON A RAILROAD TELEGRAPH SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE NECESSITY OF ELECTRICALLY BALANCING THE LINE WHICH WHILE ENTIRELY FEASIBLE ON A THROUGH LINE
2364-131735-0110 WOULD NOT BE PRACTICABLE BETWEEN A NUMBER OF INTERCOMMUNICATING POINTS EDISON'S PHONOPLEX NORMALLY DOUBLED THE CAPACITY OF TELEGRAPH LINES WHETHER EMPLOYED ON WAY BUSINESS OR THROUGH TRAFFIC
2364-131735-0111 BUT IN ACTUAL PRACTICE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN MORE THAN DOUBLE SERVICE IT HAS BEEN IN PRACTICAL USE FOR MANY YEARS ON SOME OF THE LEADING RAILROADS OF THE UNITED STATES
2364-131735-0112 THE SYSTEM IS A COMBINATION OF TELEGRAPHIC APPARATUS AND TELEPHONE RECEIVER ALTHOUGH IN THIS CASE THE LATTER INSTRUMENT IS NOT USED IN THE GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD MANNER IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE DIAPHRAGM OF A TELEPHONE VIBRATES WITH THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THE CURRENT ENERGIZING THE MAGNET BENEATH IT
2364-131735-0113 IF THE MAKE AND BREAK OF THE MAGNETIZING CURRENT BE RAPID THE VIBRATIONS BEING WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE HUMAN EAR THE DIAPHRAGM WILL PRODUCE AN AUDIBLE SOUND
2364-131735-0114 WITHOUT PRODUCING A SOUND IF THEREFORE THERE BE PLACED IN THE SAME CIRCUIT A REGULAR TELEGRAPH RELAY AND A SPECIAL TELEPHONE AN OPERATOR MAY BY MANIPULATING A KEY OPERATE THE RELAY AND ITS SOUNDER
2364-131735-0115 WITHOUT PRODUCING A SOUND IN THE TELEPHONE
2364-131735-0116 CORRESPONDING TO THE SIGNALS TRANSMITTED BUT THIS CURRENT IS TOO WEAK TO AFFECT THE TELEGRAPH RELAY
