3790-39761-0000 AND HER DEATH IN THE FOREGOING BOOK AND WILL NOW SPEAK OF WHAT FOLLOWED AND WAS CONNECTED WITH THOSE HISTORIES DECLARING BEFORE WE PROCEED THAT WE HAVE NOTHING SO MUCH AT HEART AS THIS THAT WE MAY OMIT NO FACTS
3790-39761-0001 AS THE GREATEST PART ARE UNACQUAINTED WITHAL
3790-39761-0002 AND FROM SUCH ORNAMENTS OF SPEECH ALSO AS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE PLEASURE OF OUR READERS THAT THEY MAY ENTERTAIN THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WE WRITE WITH SOME AGREEABLE SATISFACTION AND PLEASURE
3790-39761-0003 WHEN QUINTUS HORTENSIUS AND QUINTUS METELLUS WHO WAS CALLED METELLUS OF CRETE WERE CONSULS AT ROME
3790-39761-0004 AND ATTACKED AND OVERCAME THOSE HIS ADVERSARIES THAT HAD FLED THITHER AND LAY WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE TEMPLE
3790-39761-0005 HE LAID ASIDE HIS ENMITY TO HIM ON THESE CONDITIONS THAT ARISTOBULUS SHOULD BE KING THAT HE SHOULD LIVE WITHOUT INTERMEDDLING WITH PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND QUIETLY ENJOY THE ESTATE HE HAD ACQUIRED WHEN THEY HAD AGREED UPON THESE TERMS IN THE TEMPLE AND HAD CONFIRMED THE AGREEMENT WITH OATHS
3790-39761-0006 AND THE GIVING ONE ANOTHER THEIR RIGHT HANDS AND EMBRACING ONE ANOTHER IN THE SIGHT OF THE WHOLE MULTITUDE THEY DEPARTED THE ONE ARISTOBULUS TO THE PALACE
3790-39761-0007 WHO WAS AT ENMITY WITH ARISTOBULUS AND HAD DIFFERENCES WITH HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS GOOD WILL TO HYRCANUS IT IS TRUE THAT NICOLATLS OF DAMASCUS SAYS THAT ANTIPATER WAS OF THE STOCK OF THE PRINCIPAL JEWS WHO CAME OUT OF BABYLON INTO JUDEA BUT THAT ASSERTION OF HIS WAS TO GRATIFY HEROD WHO WAS HIS SON
3790-39761-0008 AND THAT HE MADE A LEAGUE OF FRIENDSHIP WITH THOSE ARABIANS AND GAZITES AND ASCALONITES THAT WERE OF HIS OWN PARTY AND HAD BY MANY AND LARGE PRESENTS MADE THEM HIS FAST FRIENDS BUT NOW THIS YOUNGER ANTIPATER WAS SUSPICIOUS OF THE POWER OF ARISTOBULUS
3790-39761-0009 AND WAS AFRAID OF SOME MISCHIEF HE MIGHT DO HIM BECAUSE OF HIS HATRED TO HIM SO HE STIRRED UP THE MOST POWERFUL OF THE JEWS AND TALKED AGAINST HIM TO THEM PRIVATELY AND SAID THAT IT WAS UNJUST TO OVERLOOK THE CONDUCT OF ARISTOBULUS WHO HAD GOTTEN THE GOVERNMENT UNRIGHTEOUSLY AND EJECTED HIS BROTHER OUT OF IT
3790-39761-0010 AND THE SAME SPEECHES HE PERPETUALLY MADE TO HYRCANUS AND TOLD HIM THAT HIS OWN LIFE WOULD BE IN DANGER UNLESS HE GUARDED HIMSELF AND GOT SHUT OF ARISTOBULUS FOR HE SAID THAT THE FRIENDS OF ARISTOBULUS OMITTED NO OPPORTUNITY OF ADVISING HIM TO KILL HIM
3790-39761-0011 AS BEING THEN AND NOT BEFORE SURE TO RETAIN HIS PRINCIPALITY HYRCANUS GAVE NO CREDIT TO THESE WORDS OF HIS AS BEING OF A GENTLE DISPOSITION AND ONE THAT DID NOT EASILY ADMIT OF CALUMNIES AGAINST OTHER MEN
3790-39761-0012 THIS TEMPER OF HIS NOT DISPOSING HIM TO MEDDLE WITH PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND WANT OF SPIRIT OCCASIONED HIM TO APPEAR TO SPECTATORS TO BE DEGENEROUS AND UNMANLY WHILE ARISTO BULUS WAS OF A CONTRARY TEMPER
3790-39761-0013 WHEN HYRCANUS HEARD THIS HE SAID THAT IT WAS FOR HIS ADVANTAGE TO FLY AWAY TO ARETAS NOW ARABIA IS A COUNTRY THAT BORDERS UPON JUDEA HOWEVER HYRCANUS SENT ANTIPATER FIRST TO THE KING OF ARABIA IN ORDER TO RECEIVE ASSURANCES FROM HIM
3790-39761-0014 THAT WHEN HE SHOULD COME IN THE MANNER OF A SUPPLICANT TO HIM HE WOULD NOT DELIVER HIM UP TO HIS ENEMIES SO ANTIPATER HAVING RECEIVED SUCH ASSURANCES RETURNED TO HYRCANUS TO JERUSALEM
3790-39761-0015 WHERE THE PALACE OF ARETAS WAS
3790-39761-0016 AND THIS PERSUASION HE CONTINUED EVERY DAY WITHOUT ANY INTERMISSION HE ALSO PROPOSED TO MAKE HIM PRESENTS ON THAT ACCOUNT AT LENGTH HE PREVAILED WITH ARETAS IN HIS SUIT MOREOVER HYRCANUS PROMISED HIM THAT WHEN HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT THITHER AND HAD RECEIVED HIS KINGDOM
3790-39761-0017 HE WOULD RESTORE THAT COUNTRY AND THOSE TWELVE CITIES WHICH HIS FATHER ALEXANDER HAD TAKEN FROM THE ARABIANS WHICH WERE THESE MEDABA NABALLO LIBIAS
3790-39761-0018 AND BEAT HIM IN THE BATTLE AND WHEN AFTER THAT VICTORY MANY WENT OVER TO HYRCANUS AS DESERTERS ARISTOBULUS WAS LEFT DESOLATE AND FLED TO JERUSALEM UPON WHICH THE KING OF ARABIA TOOK ALL HIS ARMY AND MADE AN ASSAULT UPON THE TEMPLE
3790-39761-0019 AND BESIEGED ARISTOBULUS THEREIN THE PEOPLE STILL SUPPORTING HYREANUS AND ASSISTING HIM IN THE SIEGE WHILE NONE BUT THE PRIESTS CONTINUED WITH ARISTOBULUS SO ARETAS UNITED THE FORCES OF THE ARABIANS AND OF THE JEWS TOGETHER AND PRESSED ON THE SIEGE VIGOROUSLY
3790-39761-0020 AND WHEN UPON HIS REFUSAL AND THE EXCUSES THAT HE MADE HE WAS STILL BY THE MULTITUDE COMPELLED TO SPEAK HE STOOD UP IN THE MIDST OF THEM AND SAID O GOD THE KING OF THE WHOLE WORLD
3790-39761-0021 SINCE THOSE THAT STAND NOW WITH ME ARE THY PEOPLE AND THOSE THAT ARE BESIEGED ARE ALSO THY PRIESTS I BESEECH THEE THAT THOU WILT NEITHER HEARKEN TO THE PRAYERS OF THOSE AGAINST THESE NOR BRING TO EFFECT WHAT THESE PRAY AGAINST THOSE
3790-39761-0022 AT WHICH IT IS OUR CUSTOM TO OFFER A GREAT NUMBER OF SACRIFICES TO GOD BUT THOSE THAT WERE WITH ARISTOBULUS WANTED SACRIFICES AND DESIRED THAT THEIR COUNTRYMEN WITHOUT WOULD FURNISH THEM WITH SUCH SACRIFICES
3790-39761-0023 AND WHEN THEY REQUIRED THEM TO PAY A THOUSAND DRACHMAE FOR EACH HEAD OF CATTLE ARISTOBULUS AND THE PRIESTS WILLINGLY UNDERTOOK TO PAY FOR THEM ACCORDINGLY AND THOSE WITHIN LET DOWN THE MONEY OVER THE WALLS AND GAVE IT THEM BUT WHEN THE OTHERS HAD RECEIVED IT
3790-39761-0024 AND WHEN THE PRIESTS FOUND THEY HAD BEEN CHEATED AND THAT THE AGREEMENTS THEY HAD MADE WERE VIOLATED THEY PRAYED TO GOD THAT HE WOULD AVENGE THEM ON THEIR COUNTRYMEN NOR DID HE DELAY THAT THEIR PUNISHMENT BUT SENT A STRONG AND VEHEMENT STORM OF WIND
3790-39761-0025 BUT WHEN SCAURUS WAS COME TO DAMASCUS AND FOUND THAT LOLLINS AND METELLUS HAD NEWLY TAKEN THE CITY HE CAME HIMSELF HASTILY INTO JUDEA AND WHEN HE WAS COME THITHER AMBASSADORS CAME TO HIM BOTH FROM ARISTOBULUS AND HYRCANUS AND BOTH DESIRED HE WOULD ASSIST THEM
3790-39761-0026 AND WHEN BOTH OF THEM PROMISED TO GIVE HIM MONEY ARISTOBULUS FOUR HUNDRED TALENTS AND HYRCANUS NO LESS HE ACCEPTED OF ARISTOBULUS'S PROMISE FOR HE WAS RICH AND HAD A GREAT SOUL AND DESIRED TO OBTAIN NOTHING BUT WHAT WAS MODERATE
3790-39761-0027 WHEREAS THE OTHER WAS POOR AND TENACIOUS AND MADE INCREDIBLE PROMISES IN HOPES OF GREATER ADVANTAGES FOR IT WAS NOT THE SAME THING TO TAKE A CITY THAT WAS EXCEEDING STRONG AND POWERFUL AS IT WAS TO EJECT OUT OF THE COUNTRY SOME FUGITIVES
3790-39761-0028 WITH A GREATER NUMBER OF MABATEANS WHO WERE NO VERY WARLIKE PEOPLE HE THEREFORE MADE AN AGREEMENT WITH ARISTOBULUS FOR THE REASONS BEFORE MENTIONED AND TOOK HIS MONEY AND RAISED THE SIEGE AND ORDERED ARETAS TO DEPART OR ELSE HE SHOULD BE DECLARED AN ENEMY TO THE ROMANS
3790-39761-0029 SO SCAURUS RETURNED TO DAMASCUS AGAIN AND ARISTOBULUS WITH A GREAT ARMY MADE WAR WITH ARETAS AND HYRCANUS AND FOUGHT THEM AT A PLACE CALLED PAPYRON AND BEAT THEM IN THE BATTLE AND SLEW ABOUT SIX THOUSAND OF THE ENEMY WITH WHOM FELL PHALION ALSO THE BROTHER OF ANTIPATER
3790-39761-0030 CAME AMBASSADORS AGAIN TO HIM ANTIPATER FROM HYRCANUS AND NICODEMUS FROM ARISTOBULUS WHICH LAST ALSO ACCUSED SUCH AS HAD TAKEN BRIBES FIRST GABINIUS AND THEN SCAURUS THE ONE THREE HUNDRED TALENTS AND THE OTHER FOUR HUNDRED
3790-39761-0031 HE BROUGHT HIS ARMY OUT OF THEIR WINTER QUARTERS AND MARCHED INTO THE COUNTRY OF DAMASCUS
3790-39761-0032 WHO HAD BEEN BEHEADED WHO WAS ALSO HIS RELATION BY MARRIAGE
3790-39761-0033 AND WHEN HE HAD PASSED OVER THE CITIES OF HELIOPOLIS AND CHALCIS AND GOT OVER THE MOUNTAIN WHICH IS ON THE LIMIT OF COLESYRIA HE CAME FROM PELLA TO DAMASCUS AND THERE IT WAS THAT HE HEARD THE CAUSES OF THE JEWS AND OF THEIR GOVERNORS HYRCANUS AND ARISTOBULUS
3790-39761-0034 AS ALSO OF THE NATION AGAINST THEM BOTH WHICH DID NOT DESIRE TO BE UNDER KINGLY GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT THEY RECEIVED FROM THEIR FOREFATHERS WAS THAT OF SUBJECTION TO THE PRIESTS OF THAT GOD WHOM THEY WORSHIPPED
3790-39761-0035 AND THAT HE HAD BUT A SMALL PART OF THE COUNTRY UNDER HIM ARISTOBULUS HAVING TAKEN AWAY THE REST FROM HIM BY FORCE HE ALSO ACCUSED HIM THAT THE INCURSIONS WHICH HAD BEEN MADE INTO THEIR NEIGHBORS COUNTRIES AND THE PIRACIES THAT HAD BEEN AT SEA WERE OWING TO HIM
3790-39761-0036 AND THAT THE NATION WOULD NOT HAVE REVOLTED UNLESS ARISTOBULUS HAD BEEN A MAN GIVEN TO VIOLENCE AND DISORDER AND THERE WERE NO FEWER THAN A THOUSAND JEWS OF THE BEST ESTEEM AMONG THEM WHO CONFIRMED THIS ACCUSATION WHICH CONFIRMATION WAS PROCURED BY ANTIPATER
3790-39761-0037 BUT ARISTOBULUS ALLEGED AGAINST HIM THAT IT WAS HYRCANUS'S OWN TEMPER WHICH WAS INACTIVE AND ON THAT ACCOUNT CONTEMPTIBLE
3790-39761-0038 FOR FEAR LEST IT SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO OTHERS AND THAT AS TO HIS TITLE OF KING IT WAS NO OTHER THAN WHAT HIS FATHER HAD TAKEN BEFORE HIM
3790-39761-0039 WHOSE PURPLE GARMENTS FINE HEADS OF HAIR AND OTHER ORNAMENTS WERE DETESTED BY THE COURT AND WHICH THEY APPEARED IN NOT AS THOUGH THEY WERE TO PLEAD THEIR CAUSE IN A COURT OF JUSTICE
3790-39761-0040 HE THEN SPAKE CIVILLY TO THEM AND SENT THEM AWAY AND TOLD THEM THAT WHEN HE CAME AGAIN INTO THEIR COUNTRY HE WOULD SETTLE ALL THEIR AFFAIRS AFTER HE HAD FIRST TAKEN A VIEW OF THE AFFAIRS OF THE NABATEANS IN THE MEAN TIME HE ORDERED THEM TO BE QUIET AND TREATED ARISTOBULUS CIVILLY
3790-39761-0041 LEST HE SHOULD MAKE THE NATION REVOLT AND HINDER HIS RETURN WHICH YET ARISTOBULUS DID FOR WITHOUT EXPECTING ANY FURTHER DETERMINATION WHICH POMPEY HAD PROMISED THEM
3790-39761-0042 AND THE OTHER PARTS OF SYRIA WITH THE OTHER ROMAN LEGIONS WHICH HE HAD WITH HIM HE MADE AN EXPEDITION AGAINST ARISTOBULUS
3790-39761-0043 WHICH IS THE FIRST ENTRANCE INTO JUDEA WHEN ONE PASSES OVER THE MIDLAND COUNTRIES
3790-39761-0044 WHITHER ARISTOBULUS HAD FLED AND THENCE POMPEY SENT HIS COMMANDS TO HIM THAT HE SHOULD COME TO HIM ACCORDINGLY AT THE PERSUASIONS OF MANY THAT HE WOULD NOT MAKE WAR WITH THE ROMANS HE CAME DOWN AND WHEN HE HAD DISPUTED WITH HIS BROTHER ABOUT THE RIGHT TO THE GOVERNMENT
3790-39761-0045 HE WENT UP AGAIN TO THE CITADEL AS POMPEY GAVE HIM LEAVE TO DO
3790-39761-0046 SO THAT HE STILL PRETENDED HE WOULD OBEY POMPEY IN WHATSOEVER HE COMMANDED
3790-39761-0047 THAT HE MIGHT NOT DEPRESS HIMSELF TOO LOW
3790-39761-0048 BUT WHEN POMPEY ENJOINED ARISTOBULUS TO DELIVER UP THE FORTRESSES HE HELD AND TO SEND AN INJUNCTION TO THEIR GOVERNORS UNDER HIS OWN HAND FOR THAT PURPOSE FOR THEY HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN TO DELIVER THEM UP UPON ANY OTHER COMMANDS HE SUBMITTED INDEED TO DO SO
3790-39761-0049 BUT STILL HE RETIRED IN DISPLEASURE TO JERUSALEM AND MADE PREPARATION FOR WAR
