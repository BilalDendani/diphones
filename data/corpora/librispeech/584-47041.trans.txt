584-47041-0000 ON THE MOUNTAIN CALLED HIYEI ZAN NEAR KYOTO ONE SUMMER DAY THIS GOOD PRIEST AFTER A VISIT TO THE CITY WAS RETURNING TO HIS TEMPLE BY WAY OF KITA NO OJI
584-47041-0001 THEY HAD CAUGHT THE BIRD IN A SNARE AND WERE BEATING IT WITH STICKS OH THE POOR CREATURE COMPASSIONATELY EXCLAIMED THE PRIEST WHY DO YOU TORMENT IT SO CHILDREN
584-47041-0002 ONE OF THE BOYS MADE ANSWER WE WANT TO KILL IT TO GET THE FEATHERS MOVED BY PITY THE PRIEST PERSUADED THE BOYS TO LET HIM HAVE THE KITE IN EXCHANGE FOR A FAN THAT HE WAS CARRYING
584-47041-0003 AND HE SET THE BIRD FREE IT HAD NOT BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT AND WAS ABLE TO FLY AWAY HAPPY AT HAVING PERFORMED THIS BUDDHIST ACT OF MERIT THE PRIEST THEN RESUMED HIS WALK
584-47041-0004 HE HAD NOT PROCEEDED VERY FAR WHEN HE SAW A STRANGE MONK COME OUT OF A BAMBOO GROVE BY THE ROAD SIDE AND HASTEN TOWARDS HIM THE MONK RESPECTFULLY SALUTED HIM AND SAID SIR
584-47041-0005 REALLY I CANNOT REMEMBER TO HAVE EVER SEEN YOU BEFORE PLEASE TELL ME WHO YOU ARE IT IS NOT WONDERFUL THAT YOU CANNOT RECOGNIZE ME IN THIS FORM RETURNED THE MONK
584-47041-0006 I AM THE KITE THAT THOSE CRUEL BOYS WERE TORMENTING AT KITA NO OJI YOU SAVED MY LIFE AND THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS WORLD MORE PRECIOUS THAN LIFE SO I NOW WISH TO RETURN YOUR KINDNESS IN SOME WAY OR OTHER
584-47041-0007 ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO FOR YOU IN SHORT PLEASE TO TELL ME FOR AS I HAPPEN TO POSSESS IN A SMALL DEGREE THE SIX SUPERNATURAL POWERS I AM ABLE TO GRATIFY ALMOST ANY WISH THAT YOU CAN EXPRESS
584-47041-0008 ON HEARING THESE WORDS THE PRIEST KNEW THAT HE WAS SPEAKING WITH A TENGU AND HE FRANKLY MADE ANSWER MY FRIEND I HAVE LONG CEASED TO CARE FOR THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD I AM NOW SEVENTY YEARS OF AGE
584-47041-0009 NEITHER FAME NOR PLEASURE HAS ANY ATTRACTION FOR ME I FEEL ANXIOUS ONLY ABOUT MY FUTURE BIRTH BUT AS THAT IS A MATTER IN WHICH NO ONE CAN HELP ME IT WERE USELESS TO ASK ABOUT IT
584-47041-0010 NEVER A DAY PASSES IN WHICH THIS REGRET DOES NOT COME TO ME IN THE HOUR OF MORNING OR OF EVENING PRAYER AH MY FRIEND IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO CONQUER TIME AND SPACE LIKE THE BODHISATTVAS
584-47041-0011 SO THAT I COULD LOOK UPON THAT MARVELLOUS ASSEMBLY HOW HAPPY SHOULD I BE WHY THE TENGU EXCLAIMED THAT PIOUS WISH OF YOURS CAN EASILY BE SATISFIED I PERFECTLY WELL REMEMBER THE ASSEMBLY ON THE VULTURE PEAK
584-47041-0012 YOU MUST NOT BOW DOWN NOR PRAY NOR UTTER
584-47041-0013 YOU MUST NOT SPEAK AT ALL
584-47041-0014 THE PRIEST GLADLY PROMISED TO FOLLOW THESE INJUNCTIONS AND THE TENGU HURRIED AWAY AS IF TO PREPARE THE SPECTACLE THE DAY WANED AND PASSED AND THE DARKNESS CAME BUT THE OLD PRIEST WAITED PATIENTLY BENEATH A TREE
584-47041-0015 KEEPING HIS EYES CLOSED AT LAST A VOICE SUDDENLY RESOUNDED ABOVE HIM A WONDERFUL VOICE DEEP AND CLEAR LIKE THE PEALING OF A MIGHTY BELL THE VOICE OF THE BUDDHA SAKYAMUNI
584-47041-0016 PROCLAIMING THE PERFECT WAY THEN THE PRIEST OPENING HIS EYES IN A GREAT RADIANCE PERCEIVED THAT ALL THINGS HAD BEEN CHANGED THE PLACE WAS INDEED THE VULTURE PEAK
584-47041-0017 THE HOLY INDIAN MOUNTAIN GRIDHRAKUTA AND THE TIME WAS THE TIME OF THE SUTRA OF THE LOTOS OF THE GOOD LAW NOW THERE WERE NO PINES ABOUT HIM BUT STRANGE SHINING TREES
584-47041-0018 AND THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH MANDARAVA AND MANJUSHAKA FLOWERS SHOWERED FROM HEAVEN AND THE NIGHT WAS FILLED WITH FRAGRANCE AND SPLENDOUR AND THE SWEETNESS OF THE GREAT VOICE AND IN MID AIR
584-47041-0019 SHINING AS A MOON ABOVE THE WORLD
584-47041-0020 WITH SAMANTABHADRA AT HIS RIGHT HAND AND MANJUSRI AT HIS LEFT AND BEFORE THEM ASSEMBLED IMMEASURABLY SPREADING INTO SPACE LIKE A FLOOD OF STARS THE HOSTS OF THE MAHASATTVAS AND THE BODHISATTVAS
584-47041-0021 WITH THEIR COUNTLESS FOLLOWING GODS DEMONS NAGAS GOBLINS MEN AND BEINGS NOT HUMAN SARIPUTRA HE SAW AND KASYAPA AND ANANDA
584-47041-0022 AND THE GODS OF THE SUN AND THE MOON AND THE WIND AND THE SHINING MYRIADS OF BRAHMA'S HEAVEN AND INCOMPARABLY FURTHER THAN EVEN THE MEASURELESS CIRCLING OF THE GLORY OF THESE HE SAW
584-47041-0023 MADE VISIBLE BY A SINGLE RAY OF LIGHT THAT SHOT FROM THE FOREHEAD OF THE BLESSED ONE TO PIERCE BEYOND UTTERMOST TIME THE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND
584-47041-0024 AND THE BEINGS IN EACH OF THE SIX STATES OF EXISTENCE AND EVEN THE SHAPES OF THE BUDDHAS EXTINCT THAT HAD ENTERED INTO NIRVANA THESE AND ALL THE GODS
584-47041-0025 AND ALL THE DEMONS HE SAW BOW DOWN BEFORE THE LION THRONE AND HE HEARD THAT MULTITUDE INCALCULABLE OF BEINGS PRAISING THE SUTRA OF THE LOTOS OF THE GOOD LAW LIKE THE ROAR OF A SEA BEFORE THE LORD
584-47041-0026 THEN FORGETTING UTTERLY HIS PLEDGE FOOLISHLY DREAMING THAT HE STOOD IN THE VERY PRESENCE OF THE VERY BUDDHA HE CAST HIMSELF DOWN IN WORSHIP WITH TEARS OF LOVE AND THANKSGIVING
584-47041-0027 CRYING OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE
584-47041-0028 INSTANTLY WITH A SHOCK AS OF EARTHQUAKE THE STUPENDOUS SPECTACLE DISAPPEARED AND THE PRIEST FOUND HIMSELF ALONE IN THE DARK KNEELING UPON THE GRASS OF THE MOUNTAIN SIDE
584-47041-0029 THEN A SADNESS UNSPEAKABLE FELL UPON HIM BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF THE VISION
584-47041-0030 AND HEEDLESSLY ALLOWED YOUR FEELINGS TO OVERCOME YOU THE GOHOTENDO WHO IS THE GUARDIAN OF THE DOCTRINE SWOOPED DOWN SUDDENLY FROM HEAVEN UPON US
584-47041-0031 CRYING OUT HOW DO YE DARE THUS TO DECEIVE A PIOUS PERSON THEN THE OTHER MONKS WHOM I HAD ASSEMBLED ALL FLED IN FEAR AS FOR MYSELF ONE OF MY WINGS HAS BEEN BROKEN
584-47041-0032 SO THAT NOW I CANNOT FLY AND WITH THESE WORDS THE TENGU VANISHED FOREVER
584-47041-0033 THIS STORY MAY BE FOUND IN THE CURIOUS OLD JAPANESE BOOK CALLED JIKKUN SHO THE SAME LEGEND HAS FURNISHED THE SUBJECT OF AN INTERESTING NO PLAY CALLED DAI E THE GREAT ASSEMBLY
584-47041-0034 IN JAPANESE POPULAR ART THE TENGU ARE COMMONLY REPRESENTED EITHER AS WINGED MEN WITH BEAK SHAPED NOSES OR AS BIRDS OF PREY
584-47041-0035 THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF TENGU BUT ALL ARE SUPPOSED TO BE MOUNTAIN HAUNTING SPIRITS CAPABLE OF ASSUMING MANY FORMS AND OCCASIONALLY APPEARING AS CROWS VULTURES OR EAGLES
