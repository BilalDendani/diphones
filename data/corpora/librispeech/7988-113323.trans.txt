7988-113323-0000 THAT SAME NIGHT OF HIS RELEASE ALL THE HAPPINESS OF DARNAY AND LUCIE WAS SUDDENLY BROKEN SOLDIERS CAME AND AGAIN ARRESTED HIM DEFARGE AND HIS WIFE WERE THE ACCUSERS THIS TIME AND HE WAS TO BE RETRIED
7988-113323-0001 THE FIRST ONE TO BRING THIS FRESH PIECE OF BAD NEWS TO MISTER LORRY WAS SYDNEY CARTON THE RECKLESS AND DISSIPATED YOUNG LAWYER PROBABLY HE HAD HEARD IN LONDON OF LUCIE'S TROUBLE AND OUT OF HIS LOVE FOR HER
7988-113323-0002 WHICH HE ALWAYS CARRIED HIDDEN IN HIS HEART HAD COME TO PARIS TO TRY TO AID HER HUSBAND HE HAD ARRIVED ONLY TO HEAR AT THE SAME TIME OF THE ACQUITTAL AND THE REARREST
7988-113323-0003 AS CARTON WALKED ALONG THE STREET THINKING SADLY OF LUCIE'S NEW GRIEF HE SAW A MAN WHOSE FACE AND FIGURE SEEMED FAMILIAR FOLLOWING HE SOON RECOGNIZED HIM AS THE ENGLISH SPY BARSAD
7988-113323-0004 BARSAD WHO AS IT HAPPENED WAS NOW A TURNKEY IN THE VERY PRISON WHERE DARNAY WAS CONFINED HAD LEFT LONDON TO BECOME A SPY IN FRANCE FIRST ON THE SIDE OF THE KING AND THEN ON THE SIDE OF THE PEOPLE
7988-113323-0005 AT THE TIME OF THIS STORY ENGLAND WAS SO HATED BY FRANCE THAT IF THE PEOPLE HAD KNOWN OF BARSAD'S CAREER IN LONDON
7988-113323-0006 CAME TO WORST AND DARNAY WERE CONDEMNED HE WOULD ADMIT CARTON TO THE CELL TO SEE HIM ONCE BEFORE HE WAS TAKEN TO EXECUTION
7988-113323-0007 TO SAVE HIMSELF HE HAD TO PROMISE NEXT DAY DARNAY WAS TRIED FOR THE SECOND TIME WHEN THE JUDGE ASKED FOR THE ACCUSATION DEFARGE LAID A PAPER BEFORE HIM
7988-113323-0008 IT WAS A LETTER THAT HAD BEEN FOUND WHEN THE BASTILLE FELL IN THE CELL THAT HAD BEEN OCCUPIED FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS BY DOCTOR MANETTE
7988-113323-0009 AND HIDDEN IT BEHIND A LOOSENED STONE IN THE WALL AND IN IT HE HAD TOLD THE STORY OF HIS OWN
7988-113323-0010 DEFARGE READ IT ALOUD TO THE JURY AND THIS WAS THE TERRIBLE TALE IT TOLD THE MARQUIS DE SAINT EVREMONDE THE CRUEL UNCLE OF DARNAY WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN
7988-113323-0011 AS THE BROTHER LAY DYING FROM THE SWORD WOUND DOCTOR MANETTE
7988-113323-0012 HAD BEEN CALLED TO ATTEND HIM AND SO BY ACCIDENT HAD LEARNED THE WHOLE HORRIFIED AT THE WICKED WRONG HE WROTE OF IT IN A LETTER TO THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE THE MARQUIS WHOM IT ACCUSED LEARNED OF THIS AND
7988-113323-0013 TO PUT DOCTOR MANETTE OUT OF THE WAY HAD HIM ARRESTED SECRETLY TAKEN FROM HIS WIFE AND BABY DAUGHTER
7988-113323-0014 OF THE BASTILLE WHERE HE HAD LIVED THOSE EIGHTEEN YEARS NOT KNOWING WHETHER HIS WIFE AND CHILD LIVED OR DIED HE WAITED TEN YEARS FOR RELEASE AND WHEN NONE CAME AT LAST FEELING HIS MIND GIVING WAY HE WROTE THE ACCOUNT
7988-113323-0015 WHICH HE CONCEALED IN THE CELL WALL DENOUNCING THE FAMILY OF EVREMONDE AND ALL THEIR DESCENDANTS THE READING OF THIS PAPER BY DEFARGE AS MAY BE GUESSED AROUSED ALL THE MURDEROUS PASSIONS OF THE PEOPLE IN THE COURT ROOM
7988-113323-0016 THERE WAS A FURTHER REASON FOR MADAME DEFARGE'S HATRED FOR THE POOR WOMAN WHOM DARNAY'S UNCLE HAD SO WRONGED HAD BEEN HER OWN SISTER IN VAIN OLD DOCTOR MANETTE PLEADED
7988-113323-0017 THAT HIS OWN DAUGHTER WAS NOW DARNAY'S WIFE MADE NO DIFFERENCE IN THEIR EYES THE JURY AT ONCE FOUND DARNAY GUILTY AND SENTENCED HIM TO DIE BY THE GUILLOTINE THE NEXT MORNING LUCIE FAINTED WHEN THE SENTENCE WAS PRONOUNCED SYDNEY CARTON WHO HAD WITNESSED THE TRIAL
7988-113323-0018 LIFTED HER AND BORE HER TO A CARRIAGE WHEN THEY REACHED HOME HE CARRIED HER UP THE STAIRS AND LAID HER ON A COUCH BEFORE HE WENT HE BENT DOWN AND TOUCHED HER CHEEK WITH HIS LIPS AND THEY HEARD HIM WHISPER FOR A LIFE YOU LOVE
7988-113323-0019 DAY WHAT HE MEANT CARTON HAD IN FACT FORMED A DESPERATE PLAN TO RESCUE LUCIE'S HUSBAND WHOM HE SO MUCH RESEMBLED IN FACE AND FIGURE EVEN THOUGH IT MEANT HIS OWN DEATH
7988-113323-0020 HE WENT TO MISTER LORRY AND MADE HIM PROMISE TO HAVE READY NEXT MORNING PASSPORTS AND A COACH AND SWIFT HORSES TO LEAVE PARIS FOR ENGLAND WITH DOCTOR MANETTE LUCIE AND HIMSELF TELLING HIM THAT IF THEY DELAYED LONGER LUCIE'S LIFE AND HER FATHER'S ALSO WOULD BE LOST
7988-113323-0021 NEXT CARTON BOUGHT A QUANTITY OF A DRUG WHOSE FUMES WOULD RENDER A MAN INSENSIBLE AND WITH THIS IN HIS POCKET EARLY NEXT MORNING HE WENT TO THE SPY BARSAD AND BADE HIM REDEEM HIS PROMISE AND TAKE HIM TO THE CELL WHERE DARNAY WAITED FOR THE SIGNAL OF DEATH
7988-113323-0022 DARNAY WAS SEATED WRITING A LAST LETTER TO LUCIE WHEN CARTON ENTERED PRETENDING THAT HE WISHED HIM TO WRITE SOMETHING THAT HE DICTATED CARTON STOOD OVER HIM AND HELD
7988-113323-0023 OF THE DRUG TO HIS FACE IN A MOMENT THE OTHER WAS UNCONSCIOUS THEN CARTON CHANGED CLOTHES WITH HIM AND CALLED IN THE SPY
7988-113323-0024 DIRECTING HIM TO TAKE THE UNCONSCIOUS MAN WHO NOW SEEMED TO BE SYDNEY CARTON INSTEAD OF CHARLES DARNAY TO MISTER LORRY'S HOUSE HE HIMSELF WAS TO TAKE THE PRISONER'S PLACE AND SUFFER THE PENALTY THE PLAN WORKED WELL DARNAY WHO WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED
7988-113323-0025 THIS SACRIFICE IF HE HAD KNOWN WAS CARRIED SAFELY AND WITHOUT DISCOVERY PAST THE GUARDS MISTER LORRY GUESSING WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHEN HE SAW THE UNCONSCIOUS FIGURE TOOK COACH AT ONCE WITH HIM DOCTOR MANETTE
7988-113323-0026 AND LUCIE AND STARTED FOR ENGLAND THAT VERY HOUR MISS PROSS WAS LEFT TO FOLLOW THEM IN ANOTHER CARRIAGE WHILE MISS PROSS SAT WAITING IN THE EMPTY HOUSE WHO SHOULD COME IN BUT THE TERRIBLE MADAME DEFARGE
7988-113323-0027 THE LATTER HAD MADE UP HER MIND AS CARTON HAD SUSPECTED TO DENOUNCE LUCIE ALSO IT WAS AGAINST THE LAW TO MOURN FOR ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN CONDEMNED AS AN ENEMY TO FRANCE AND THE WOMAN WAS SURE OF COURSE THAT LUCIE WOULD BE MOURNING FOR HER HUSBAND
7988-113323-0028 WHO WAS TO DIE WITHIN THE HOUR SO SHE STOPPED ON HER WAY TO THE EXECUTION TO SEE LUCIE AND THUS HAVE EVIDENCE AGAINST HER
7988-113323-0029 THE GRIM OLD NURSE KNEW IF IT WERE KNOWN THAT LUCIE HAD GONE THE COACH WOULD BE PURSUED AND BROUGHT BACK SO SHE PLANTED HERSELF IN FRONT OF THE DOOR OF LUCIE'S ROOM AND WOULD NOT LET MADAME DEFARGE OPEN IT
7988-113323-0030 THE SAVAGE FRENCHWOMAN TRIED TO TEAR HER AWAY BUT MISS PROSS SEIZED HER AROUND THE WAIST AND HELD HER BACK THE OTHER DREW A LOADED PISTOL FROM HER BREAST TO SHOOT HER BUT IN THE STRUGGLE IT WENT OFF AND KILLED MADAME DEFARGE HERSELF
7988-113323-0031 THEN MISS PROSS ALL OF A TREMBLE LOCKED THE DOOR THREW THE KEY INTO THE RIVER TOOK A CARRIAGE AND FOLLOWED AFTER THE COACH NOT LONG AFTER THE UNCONSCIOUS DARNAY WITH LUCIE AND DOCTOR MANETTE
7988-113323-0032 PASSED THE GATES OF PARIS THE JAILER CAME TO THE CELL WHERE SYDNEY CARTON SAT AND CALLED HIM IT WAS THE SUMMONS TO DIE AND WITH HIS THOUGHTS ON LUCIE WHOM HE HAD ALWAYS HOPELESSLY LOVED AND ON HER HUSBAND
7988-113323-0033 WHOM HE HAD THUS SAVED TO HER HE WENT ALMOST GLADLY A POOR LITTLE SEAMSTRESS RODE IN THE DEATH CART BESIDE HIM SHE WAS SO SMALL AND WEAK THAT SHE FEARED TO DIE AND CARTON HELD HER COLD HAND
7988-113323-0034 ALL THE WAY AND COMFORTED HER TO THE END CRUEL WOMEN OF THE PEOPLE SAT ABOUT THE GUILLOTINE KNITTING AND COUNTING WITH THEIR STITCHES AS EACH POOR VICTIM DIED AND WHEN CARTON'S TURN CAME THINKING HE WAS DARNAY
7988-113323-0035 THE HATED MARQUIS DE SAINT EVREMONDE THEY CURSED HIM AND LAUGHED MEN SAID OF HIM ABOUT THE CITY THAT NIGHT THAT IT WAS THE PEACEFULLEST MAN'S FACE EVER BEHELD THERE
7988-113323-0036 I SEE THE LIVES FOR WHICH I LAY DOWN MINE PEACEFUL AND HAPPY IN THAT ENGLAND I SHALL SEE NO MORE I SEE LUCIE AND DARNAY WITH A CHILD THAT BEARS MY NAME
7988-113323-0037 I SEE HER WEEPING FOR ME ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF THIS DAY I SEE THE BLOT I THREW UPON MY NAME FADED AWAY AND I KNOW THAT TILL THEY DIE NEITHER SHALL BE MORE HONORED IN THE SOUL OF THE OTHER
7988-113323-0038 THAN I AM HONORED IN THE SOULS OF BOTH IT IS A FAR FAR BETTER THING THAT I DO THAN I HAVE EVER DONE
