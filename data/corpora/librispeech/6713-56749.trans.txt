6713-56749-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT OF SOLITUDE
6713-56749-0001 LET US PRETERMIT THAT LONG COMPARISON
6713-56749-0002 ARE IN THE RIGHT WHEN THEY ARE CAUTIOUS THAT THOSE WHO EMBARK WITH THEM IN THE SAME BOTTOM BE NEITHER DISSOLUTE BLASPHEMERS NOR VICIOUS OTHER WAYS LOOKING UPON SUCH SOCIETY AS UNFORTUNATE
6713-56749-0003 AND THEREFORE IT WAS THAT BIAS PLEASANTLY SAID TO SOME WHO BEING WITH HIM IN A DANGEROUS STORM IMPLORED THE ASSISTANCE OF THE GODS
6713-56749-0004 ALBUQUERQUE VICEROY IN THE INDIES FOR EMMANUEL KING OF PORTUGAL IN AN EXTREME PERIL OF SHIPWRECK TOOK A YOUNG BOY UPON HIS SHOULDERS FOR THIS ONLY END THAT IN THE SOCIETY OF THEIR COMMON DANGER
6713-56749-0005 HIS INNOCENCE MIGHT SERVE TO PROTECT HIM AND TO RECOMMEND HIM TO THE DIVINE FAVOUR THAT THEY MIGHT GET SAFE TO SHORE TIS NOT THAT A WISE MAN MAY NOT LIVE EVERYWHERE CONTENT
6713-56749-0006 AND BE ALONE IN THE VERY CROWD OF A PALACE BUT IF IT BE LEFT TO HIS OWN CHOICE THE SCHOOLMAN WILL TELL YOU THAT HE SHOULD FLY THE VERY SIGHT OF THE CROWD HE WILL ENDURE IT IF NEED BE BUT IF IT BE REFERRED TO HIM
6713-56749-0007 HE WILL CHOOSE TO BE ALONE HE CANNOT THINK HIMSELF SUFFICIENTLY RID OF VICE IF HE MUST YET CONTEND WITH IT IN OTHER MEN CHARONDAS PUNISHED THOSE AS EVIL MEN WHO WERE CONVICTED OF KEEPING ILL COMPANY
6713-56749-0008 THERE IS NOTHING SO UNSOCIABLE AND SOCIABLE AS MAN THE ONE BY HIS VICE THE OTHER BY HIS NATURE AND ANTISTHENES IN MY OPINION DID NOT GIVE HIM A SATISFACTORY ANSWER
6713-56749-0009 WHO REPROACHED HIM WITH FREQUENTING ILL COMPANY BY SAYING THAT THE PHYSICIANS LIVED WELL ENOUGH AMONGST THE SICK FOR IF THEY CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEALTH OF THE SICK
6713-56749-0010 CONTINUAL SIGHT OF AND FAMILIARITY WITH DISEASES THEY MUST OF NECESSITY IMPAIR THEIR OWN NOW THE END I TAKE IT IS ALL ONE TO LIVE AT MORE LEISURE AND AT ONE'S EASE BUT MEN DO NOT ALWAYS TAKE THE RIGHT WAY
6713-56749-0011 THEY OFTEN THINK THEY HAVE TOTALLY TAKEN LEAVE OF ALL BUSINESS WHEN THEY HAVE ONLY EXCHANGED ONE EMPLOYMENT FOR ANOTHER THERE IS LITTLE LESS TROUBLE IN GOVERNING A PRIVATE FAMILY THAN A WHOLE KINGDOM
6713-56749-0012 BY BEING MOVED UP AND DOWN IN THE PLACE WHERE THEY ARE DESIGNED TO STAND THEREFORE IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO GET REMOTE FROM THE PUBLIC TIS NOT ENOUGH TO SHIFT THE SOIL ONLY A MAN MUST FLEE FROM THE POPULAR CONDITIONS
6713-56749-0013 AS IF WITHOUT WIFE CHILDREN GOODS TRAIN OR ATTENDANCE TO THE END THAT WHEN IT SHALL SO FALL OUT THAT WE MUST LOSE ANY OR ALL OF THESE
6713-56749-0014 THERE IS NOT ONE OF A THOUSAND THAT CONCERNS OURSELVES HE THAT THOU SEEST SCRAMBLING UP THE RUINS OF THAT WALL FURIOUS AND TRANSPORTED AGAINST WHOM SO MANY HARQUEBUSS SHOTS ARE LEVELLED AND THAT OTHER ALL OVER SCARS
6713-56749-0015 PALE AND FAINTING WITH HUNGER AND YET RESOLVED RATHER TO DIE THAN TO OPEN THE GATES TO HIM DOST THOU THINK THAT THESE MEN ARE THERE UPON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT NO PERADVENTURE IN THE BEHALF OF ONE WHOM THEY NEVER SAW
6713-56749-0016 AND WHO NEVER CONCERNS HIMSELF FOR THEIR PAINS AND DANGER BUT LIES WALLOWING THE WHILE IN SLOTH AND PLEASURE THIS OTHER SLAVERING
6713-56749-0017 THAT THOU SEEST COME OUT OF HIS STUDY AFTER MIDNIGHT DOST THOU THINK HE HAS BEEN TUMBLING OVER BOOKS TO LEARN HOW TO BECOME A BETTER MAN WISER AND MORE CONTENT NO SUCH MATTER HE WILL THERE END HIS DAYS
6713-56749-0018 BUT HE WILL TEACH POSTERITY THE MEASURE OF PLAUTUS VERSES AND THE TRUE ORTHOGRAPHY OF A LATIN WORD
6713-56749-0019 HIS REPOSE AND HIS VERY LIFE
6713-56749-0020 THE MOST USELESS FRIVOLOUS AND FALSE COIN THAT PASSES CURRENT AMONGST US OUR OWN DEATH DOES NOT SUFFICIENTLY TERRIFY AND TROUBLE US
6713-56749-0021 AFTER THE EXAMPLE OF THALES WE HAVE LIVED ENOUGH FOR OTHERS
6713-56749-0022 LET US NOW CALL IN OUR THOUGHTS AND INTENTIONS TO OURSELVES AND TO OUR OWN EASE AND REPOSE TIS NO LIGHT THING TO MAKE A SURE RETREAT IT WILL BE ENOUGH FOR US TO DO WITHOUT MIXING OTHER ENTERPRISES
6713-56749-0023 SINCE GOD GIVES US LEISURE TO ORDER OUR REMOVAL LET US MAKE READY TRUSS OUR BAGGAGE TAKE LEAVE BETIMES OF THE COMPANY AND DISENTANGLE OURSELVES FROM THOSE VIOLENT IMPORTUNITIES THAT ENGAGE US ELSEWHERE
6713-56749-0024 AND SEPARATE US FROM OURSELVES WE MUST BREAK THE KNOT OF OUR OBLIGATIONS HOW STRONG SOEVER AND HEREAFTER LOVE THIS OR THAT BUT ESPOUSE NOTHING BUT OURSELVES THAT IS TO SAY LET THE REMAINDER BE OUR OWN
6713-56749-0025 BUT NOT SO JOINED AND SO CLOSE AS NOT TO BE FORCED AWAY WITHOUT FLAYING US OR TEARING OUT PART OF OUR WHOLE THE GREATEST THING IN THE WORLD IS FOR A MAN TO KNOW THAT HE IS HIS OWN TIS TIME TO WEAN OURSELVES FROM SOCIETY
6713-56749-0026 WHEN WE CAN NO LONGER ADD ANYTHING TO IT HE WHO IS NOT IN A CONDITION TO LEND MUST FORBID HIMSELF TO BORROW OUR FORCES BEGIN TO FAIL US LET US CALL THEM IN AND CONCENTRATE THEM IN AND FOR OURSELVES
6713-56749-0027 HE THAT CAN CAST OFF WITHIN HIMSELF AND RESOLVE THE OFFICES OF FRIENDSHIP AND COMPANY LET HIM DO IT IN THIS DECAY OF NATURE WHICH RENDERS HIM USELESS BURDENSOME AND IMPORTUNATE TO OTHERS
6713-56749-0028 LET HIM TAKE CARE NOT TO BE USELESS
6713-56749-0029 SO FAR AS THEY ARE PLEASANT TO US BUT BY NO MEANS TO LAY OUR PRINCIPAL FOUNDATION THERE TIS NO TRUE ONE NEITHER NATURE NOR REASON ALLOWS IT SO TO BE WHY THEREFORE SHOULD WE CONTRARY TO THEIR LAWS
6713-56749-0030 ENSLAVE OUR OWN CONTENTMENT TO THE POWER OF ANOTHER TO ANTICIPATE ALSO THE ACCIDENTS OF FORTUNE TO DEPRIVE OURSELVES
6713-56749-0031 AS SEVERAL HAVE DONE UPON THE ACCOUNT OF DEVOTION AND SOME PHILOSOPHERS BY REASONING TO BE ONE'S OWN SERVANT TO LIE HARD TO PUT OUT OUR OWN EYES TO THROW OUR WEALTH INTO THE RIVER TO GO IN SEARCH OF GRIEF
6713-56749-0032 I DO NOT THINK ARCESILAUS THE PHILOSOPHER THE LESS TEMPERATE AND VIRTUOUS FOR KNOWING THAT HE MADE USE OF GOLD AND SILVER VESSELS
6713-56749-0033 I HAVE INDEED A BETTER OPINION OF HIM THAN IF HE HAD DENIED HIMSELF WHAT HE USED WITH LIBERALITY AND MODERATION I SEE THE UTMOST LIMITS OF NATURAL NECESSITY AND
6713-56749-0034 CONSIDERING A POOR MAN BEGGING AT MY DOOR OFTTIMES MORE JOCUND AND MORE HEALTHY THAN I MYSELF AM I PUT MYSELF INTO HIS PLACE AND ATTEMPT TO DRESS MY MIND AFTER HIS MODE AND RUNNING IN LIKE MANNER
6713-56749-0035 POVERTY CONTEMPT AND SICKNESS TREADING ON MY HEELS I EASILY RESOLVE NOT TO BE AFFRIGHTED
6713-56749-0036 TAKES THEM WITH SO MUCH PATIENCE AND AM NOT WILLING TO BELIEVE THAT A LESS UNDERSTANDING CAN DO MORE THAN A GREATER OR THAT THE EFFECTS OF PRECEPT
6713-56749-0037 AS THOSE OF CUSTOM AND KNOWING OF HOW UNCERTAIN DURATION THESE ACCIDENTAL CONVENIENCES ARE I NEVER FORGET IN THE HEIGHT OF ALL MY ENJOYMENTS TO MAKE IT MY CHIEFEST PRAYER TO ALMIGHTY GOD
6713-56749-0038 THAT HE WILL PLEASE TO RENDER ME CONTENT WITH MYSELF AND THE CONDITION WHEREIN I AM I SEE YOUNG MEN VERY GAY AND FROLIC WHO NEVERTHELESS KEEP A MASS OF PILLS IN THEIR TRUNK AT HOME TO TAKE WHEN THEY'VE GOT A COLD
6713-56749-0039 WHICH THEY FEAR SO MUCH THE LESS BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY HAVE REMEDY AT HAND EVERY ONE SHOULD DO IN LIKE MANNER AND MOREOVER IF THEY FIND THEMSELVES SUBJECT TO SOME MORE VIOLENT DISEASE SHOULD FURNISH THEMSELVES
6713-56749-0040 WITH SUCH MEDICINES AS MAY NUMB AND STUPEFY THE PART THE EMPLOYMENT A MAN SHOULD CHOOSE FOR SUCH A LIFE OUGHT NEITHER TO BE A LABORIOUS NOR AN UNPLEASING ONE OTHERWISE TIS TO NO PURPOSE AT ALL TO BE RETIRED
6713-56749-0041 AND THIS DEPENDS UPON EVERY ONE'S LIKING AND HUMOUR MINE HAS NO MANNER OF COMPLACENCY FOR HUSBANDRY AND SUCH AS LOVE IT OUGHT TO APPLY THEMSELVES TO IT WITH MODERATION ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE CIRCUMSTANCES SUBJECT TO ME
6713-56749-0042 FILLING THEIR HOPES AND COURAGE WITH CERTAINTY OF DIVINE PROMISES IN THE OTHER LIFE IS MUCH MORE RATIONALLY FOUNDED
6713-56749-0043 AN INFINITE OBJECT IN GOODNESS AND POWER THE SOUL HAS THERE WHEREWITHAL AT FULL LIBERTY
6713-56749-0044 AFFLICTIONS AND SUFFERINGS TURN TO THEIR ADVANTAGE BEING UNDERGONE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF ETERNAL HEALTH AND JOY DEATH IS TO BE WISHED AND LONGED FOR WHERE IT IS THE PASSAGE TO SO PERFECT A CONDITION
6713-56749-0045 THE ASPERITY OF THE RULES THEY IMPOSE UPON THEMSELVES IS IMMEDIATELY SOFTENED BY CUSTOM AND ALL THEIR CARNAL APPETITES BAFFLED AND SUBDUED BY REFUSING TO HUMOUR AND FEED THEM
6713-56749-0046 THESE BEING ONLY SUPPORTED BY USE AND EXERCISE THIS SOLE END OF ANOTHER HAPPILY IMMORTAL LIFE IS THAT WHICH REALLY MERITS THAT WE SHOULD ABANDON THE PLEASURES AND CONVENIENCES OF THIS
6713-56749-0047 AND HE WHO CAN REALLY AND CONSTANTLY INFLAME HIS SOUL WITH THE ARDOUR OF THIS VIVID FAITH AND HOPE ERECTS FOR HIMSELF IN SOLITUDE A MORE VOLUPTUOUS AND DELICIOUS LIFE
6713-56749-0048 NEITHER THE END THEN NOR THE MEANS OF THIS ADVICE PLEASES ME FOR WE OFTEN FALL OUT OF THE FRYING PAN INTO THE FIRE OR WE ALWAYS RELAPSE ILL FROM FEVER INTO FEVER
6713-56749-0049 THIS BOOK EMPLOYMENT IS AS PAINFUL AS ANY OTHER AND AS GREAT AN ENEMY TO HEALTH WHICH OUGHT TO BE THE FIRST THING CONSIDERED NEITHER OUGHT A MAN TO BE ALLURED WITH THE PLEASURE OF IT WHICH IS THE SAME THAT DESTROYS THE FRUGAL
6713-56749-0050 WHEEDLE AND CARESS ONLY TO STRANGLE US LIKE THOSE THIEVES THE EGYPTIANS CALLED PHILISTAE IF THE HEADACHE SHOULD COME BEFORE DRUNKENNESS WE SHOULD HAVE A CARE OF DRINKING TOO MUCH BUT PLEASURE TO DECEIVE US
6713-56749-0051 MARCHES BEFORE AND CONCEALS HER TRAIN BOOKS ARE PLEASANT BUT IF BY BEING OVER STUDIOUS WE IMPAIR OUR HEALTH AND SPOIL OUR GOODHUMOUR THE BEST PIECES WE HAVE LET US GIVE IT OVER I FOR MY PART
6713-56749-0052 THAT NO FRUIT DERIVED FROM THEM CAN RECOMPENSE SO GREAT A LOSS AS MEN WHO HAVE LONG FELT THEMSELVES WEAKENED BY INDISPOSITION
6713-56749-0053 AND SUBMIT TO CERTAIN RULES OF LIVING WHICH THEY ARE FOR THE FUTURE NEVER TO TRANSGRESS SO HE WHO RETIRES WEARY OF AND DISGUSTED WITH THE COMMON WAY OF LIVING OUGHT TO MODEL THIS NEW ONE HE ENTERS INTO BY THE RULES OF REASON
6713-56749-0054 AND ESTABLISH IT BY PREMEDITATION
6713-56749-0055 THERE ARE STERILE KNOTTY SCIENCES
6713-56749-0056 ARE THINGS THAT CANNOT POSSIBLY INHABIT IN ONE AND THE SAME PLACE FOR SO MUCH AS I UNDERSTAND
6713-56749-0057 THE ADVICE OF TWO PHILOSOPHERS OF TWO VERY DIFFERENT SECTS WRITING THE ONE
6713-56749-0058 THEIR FRIENDS TO RETIRE INTO SOLITUDE FROM WORLDLY HONOURS AND AFFAIRS
6713-56749-0059 COME NOW AND DIE IN THE HARBOUR YOU HAVE GIVEN THE FIRST PART OF YOUR LIFE TO THE LIGHT GIVE WHAT REMAINS TO THE SHADE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE OVER BUSINESS
6713-56749-0060 THEREFORE DISENGAGE YOURSELVES FROM ALL CONCERN OF NAME AND GLORY TIS TO BE FEARED THE LUSTRE OF YOUR FORMER ACTIONS WILL GIVE YOU BUT TOO MUCH LIGHT AND FOLLOW YOU INTO YOUR MOST PRIVATE RETREAT
6713-56749-0061 AND PARTS NEVER CONCERN YOURSELVES THEY WILL NOT LOSE THEIR EFFECT
6713-56749-0062 REMEMBER HIM WHO BEING ASKED WHY HE TOOK SO MUCH PAINS IN AN ART THAT COULD COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF BUT FEW PERSONS A FEW ARE ENOUGH FOR ME REPLIED HE I HAVE ENOUGH WITH ONE I HAVE ENOUGH
6713-56749-0063 YOU AND A COMPANION ARE THEATRE ENOUGH TO ONE ANOTHER OR YOU TO YOURSELF LET THE PEOPLE BE TO YOU ONE AND BE YOU ONE TO THE WHOLE PEOPLE TIS AN UNWORTHY AMBITION
6713-56749-0064 THEY WILL KEEP YOU IN THIS WAY TO BE CONTENTED WITH YOURSELF TO BORROW NOTHING OF ANY OTHER BUT YOURSELF TO STAY AND FIX YOUR SOUL IN CERTAIN AND LIMITED THOUGHTS WHEREIN SHE MAY PLEASE HERSELF
6713-56749-0065 AND HAVING UNDERSTOOD THE TRUE AND REAL GOODS WHICH MEN THE MORE ENJOY THE MORE THEY UNDERSTAND TO REST SATISFIED WITHOUT DESIRE OF PROLONGATION OF LIFE OR NAME THIS IS THE PRECEPT OF THE TRUE AND NATURAL PHILOSOPHY
