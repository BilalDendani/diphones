4779-85498-0023 HE COMPOSED THE FOLLOWING EPISTLE HELEN
4779-85498-0024 TO WISH FOR PERMISSION TO BECOME THE GUEST OF A FAMILY WHO FROM THE HOUR OF YOUR LATE FATHER'S DEATH HAS EVER TREATED ME WITH THE MOST CRUEL AND UNMERITED UNKINDNESS IS A MYSTERY THAT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT WAS THIS UNKINDNESS WHICH DROVE ME
4779-85498-0025 SOONER THAN I COULD HAVE WISHED TO DO IT TO FIND A FRIEND AND ADVISER IN MISTER CARTWRIGHT AND MY ONLY FEAR NOW IS THAT HIS INDULGENT GENTLENESS TOWARDS MY CHILDREN MAY PREVENT HIS BEING SO FIRM A SUPPORT TO ME IN THE GUIDING THEM AS I MAY SOMETIMES REQUIRE BUT IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE
4779-85498-0026 AND MOREOVER I BEG YOU TO INFORM THE UNPRINCIPLED PAIR WHO WOULD SEDUCE YOU FROM YOUR MOTHER'S ROOF THAT IF ON THE PRESENT OR ANY FUTURE OCCASION THEY SHOULD PERSUADE YOU TO COMMIT SO GREAT A SIN I SHALL TAKE LEGAL MEASURES TO RECOVER THE POSSESSION OF YOUR PERSON TILL SUCH TIME AS YOU SHALL BE OF AGE
4779-85498-0027 WHEN IF UNHAPPILY EVIL COUNSELLORS SHOULD STILL HAVE INFLUENCE OVER YOU I SHALL GIVE YOU UP TO THEM TO PENNILESS OBSCURITY TO YOUR OWN HEART'S REMORSE AND TO THAT SENTENCE OF EVERLASTING CONDEMNATION WHICH WILL IN SUCH CASE INFALLIBLY DOOM YOU TO THE REGION WHERE THERE IS HOWLING AND GNASHING OF TEETH
4779-85498-0028 AS FOR MY WARD MISS TORRINGTON I MUST OF COURSE TAKE THE SAME SUMMARY MODE OF GETTING HER AGAIN UNDER MY PROTECTION FOR SUCH TIME AS I SHALL CONTINUE TO BE HER LEGAL GUARDIAN CLARA HELENA FRANCES CARTWRIGHT CARTWRIGHT PARK WEDNESDAY
4779-85498-0029 WHEN THIS COMPOSITION WAS COMPLETED MISTER CARTWRIGHT TURNED THE DESK TO HIS LADY LAID A FAIR SHEET OF BLANK PAPER BEFORE HER PUT A PEN INTO HER HAND DREW THE WAX LIGHTS NEAR HER AND THEN SET ABOUT SIPPING THE NEGUS SHE HAD SO KINDLY PREPARED FOR HIM
4779-85498-0030 WITHOUT APPEARING TO THINK IT AT ALL NECESSARY TO ASK HER OPINION OF THE DOCUMENT SHE WAS ABOUT TO COPY BEING HOWEVER RATHER NEW TO THE YOKE INTO WHICH IT HAD PLEASED HER TO THRUST HER HEAD SHE TOOK THE LIBERTY OF READING IT A SLIGHT AUGMENTATION OF COLOUR WAS PERCEIVED ON HER DELICATE CHEEK AS SHE PROCEEDED
4779-85498-0031 BY THE WATCHFUL EYE OF HER HUSBAND AS HE TURNED IT TOWARDS HER OVER THE TOP OF THE BEAUTIFULLY CUT GOBLET HE HELD IN HIS HAND BUT HE NIBBLED A BISCUIT AND SAID NOTHING WHEN THE PERUSAL OF IT WAS COMPLETED MISSUS CARTWRIGHT DIPPED THE PEN SHE STILL HELD BETWEEN HER FINGERS IN THE INK BUT BEFORE SHE BEGAN TO USE IT
4779-85498-0032 SHE PAUSED THE COLOUR MOUNTED A LITTLE HIGHER STILL AND SHE VENTURED TO SAY IN THE VERY GENTLEST ACCENT IN THE WORLD MY DEAR FRIEND DO YOU NOT THINK THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE SOFTENED AS HOW MY SWEETEST
4779-85498-0033 AT LENGTH SHE SAID IF YOU DEAR CARTWRIGHT AGREE WITH ME ABOUT IT YOU WOULD MAKE THE ALTERATION SO MUCH BETTER YOURSELF PERHAPS I MIGHT MY LOVELY CLARA BUT AS THE FACT IS THAT I DO NOT AGREE WITH YOU AT ALL ON THE SUBJECT
4779-85498-0034 I SUSPECT YOUR EPISTLE WOULD BE RATHER THE WORSE THAN THE BETTER FOR ANY THING FURTHER THAT I COULD DO TO IT HE ROSE AS HE SPOKE AND GOING BEHIND HER APPEARED TO READ THE PAPER OVER HER SHOULDER AND HAVING SATISFIED HIMSELF WITH THE EXAMINATION KISSED HER FAIR THROAT AS HE BENT OVER IT
4779-85498-0035 ADDING AS HE TOOK A LIGHT FROM THE TABLE I AM GOING TO THE LIBRARY TO LOOK FOR A BOOK MY LOVE WRITE IT EXACTLY AS YOU LIKE AND I WILL SEAL IT FOR YOU WHEN I RETURN
4779-85498-0036 NO ONE WHO KNEW MISSUS CARTWRIGHT COULD HAVE THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT THE LETTER WOULD BE VERY FAIRLY COPIED BY THE TIME HER OBLIGING HUSBAND RETURNED AND SO IT WAS EVERY WORD OF IT EXCEPTING THE DATE SHE APPEARED TO BE IN THE VERY ACT OF WRITING THIS WHEN HE CAME BACK AND STOPPING SHORT AS HE ENTERED
4779-85498-0037 SHE SAID IN A VOICE THAT CERTAINLY FALTERED A LITTLE MY DEAR CARTWRIGHT DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO LET THOSE ODIOUS HARRINGTONS HEAR FROM SOME OTHER QUARTER OF THIS CHANGE IN THE NAME OF OUR PLACE NOT BUT THAT I APPROVE IT I ASSURE YOU PERFECTLY
4779-85498-0038 THEN PERHAPS DEAREST SAID HE AGAIN COMING BEHIND HER AND CARESSING HER NECK PERHAPS YOU MAY THINK IT WOULD PLEASE HER LADYSHIP BETTER IF YOUR OWN NAME AS YOU HAVE ACCEPTED IT FROM ME WERE TO BE SUPPRESSED
