204-162375-0000 COMING TO THE TOP OF A HILL I SAW ALL THE COUNTRY FALL AWAY BEFORE ME DOWN TO THE SEA AND IN THE MIDST OF THIS DESCENT ON A LONG RIDGE
204-162375-0001 THERE WAS A FLAG UPON THE CASTLE AND SHIPS MOVING OR LYING ANCHORED IN THE FIRTH BOTH OF WHICH FOR AS FAR AWAY AS THEY WERE I COULD DISTINGUISH CLEARLY AND BOTH BROUGHT MY COUNTRY HEART INTO MY MOUTH PRESENTLY AFTER
204-162375-0002 I CAME BY A HOUSE WHERE A SHEPHERD LIVED AND GOT A ROUGH DIRECTION FOR THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF CRAMOND AND SO FROM ONE TO ANOTHER WORKED MY WAY TO THE WESTWARD OF THE CAPITAL BY COLINTON TILL I CAME OUT UPON THE GLASGOW ROAD AND THERE TO MY GREAT PLEASURE AND WONDER
204-162375-0003 THE PRIDE OF LIFE SEEMED TO MOUNT INTO MY BRAIN AT THE SIGHT OF THE RED COATS AND THE HEARING OF THAT MERRY MUSIC A LITTLE FARTHER ON
204-162375-0004 AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE PLAINNESS OF MY APPEARANCE IN MY COUNTRY HABIT AND THAT ALL DUSTY FROM THE ROAD CONSORTED ILL WITH THE GREATNESS OF THE PLACE TO WHICH I WAS BOUND BUT AFTER TWO OR MAYBE THREE HAD GIVEN ME THE SAME LOOK AND THE SAME ANSWER
204-162375-0005 THE BETTER TO SET THIS FEAR AT REST I CHANGED THE FORM OF MY INQUIRIES AND SPYING AN HONEST FELLOW COMING ALONG A LANE ON THE SHAFT OF HIS CART I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD EVER HEARD TELL OF A HOUSE THEY CALLED THE HOUSE OF SHAWS
204-162375-0006 HE STOPPED HIS CART AND LOOKED AT ME LIKE THE OTHERS AY SAID HE WHAT FOR IT'S A GREAT HOUSE I ASKED DOUBTLESS SAYS HE
204-162375-0007 THE HOUSE IS A BIG MUCKLE HOUSE AY SAID I BUT THE FOLK THAT ARE IN IT FOLK CRIED HE
204-162375-0008 WHAT SAY I NOT MISTER EBENEZER
204-162375-0009 SAYS THE MAN THERE'S THE LAIRD TO BE SURE IF IT'S HIM YOU'RE WANTING WHAT'LL LIKE BE YOUR BUSINESS MANNIE I WAS LED TO THINK THAT I WOULD GET A SITUATION I SAID LOOKING AS MODEST AS I COULD WHAT
204-162375-0010 CRIES THE CARTER IN SO SHARP A NOTE THAT HIS VERY HORSE STARTED AND THEN WELL MANNIE HE ADDED IT'S NANE OF MY AFFAIRS BUT YE SEEM A DECENT SPOKEN LAD AND IF YE'LL TAKE A WORD FROM ME YE'LL KEEP CLEAR OF THE SHAWS
204-162375-0011 THE NEXT PERSON I CAME ACROSS WAS A DAPPER LITTLE MAN IN A BEAUTIFUL WHITE WIG WHOM I SAW TO BE A BARBER ON HIS ROUNDS AND KNOWING WELL THAT BARBERS WERE GREAT GOSSIPS I ASKED HIM PLAINLY WHAT SORT OF A MAN WAS MISTER BALFOUR OF THE SHAWS
204-162375-0012 HOOT HOOT HOOT SAID THE BARBER NAE KIND OF A MAN NAE KIND OF A MAN AT ALL AND BEGAN TO ASK ME VERY SHREWDLY WHAT MY BUSINESS WAS BUT I WAS MORE THAN A MATCH FOR HIM AT THAT
204-162375-0013 AND HE WENT ON TO HIS NEXT CUSTOMER NO WISER THAN HE CAME I CANNOT WELL DESCRIBE THE BLOW THIS DEALT TO MY ILLUSIONS THE MORE INDISTINCT THE ACCUSATIONS WERE THE LESS I LIKED THEM FOR THEY LEFT THE WIDER FIELD TO FANCY
204-162375-0014 WHAT KIND OF A GREAT HOUSE WAS THIS THAT ALL THE PARISH SHOULD START AND STARE TO BE ASKED THE WAY TO IT OR WHAT SORT OF A GENTLEMAN THAT HIS ILL FAME SHOULD BE THUS CURRENT ON THE WAYSIDE IF AN HOUR'S WALKING WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ME BACK TO ESSENDEAN
204-162375-0015 BUT WHEN I HAD COME SO FAR A WAY ALREADY MERE SHAME WOULD NOT SUFFER ME TO DESIST TILL I HAD PUT THE MATTER TO THE TOUCH OF PROOF I WAS BOUND OUT OF MERE SELF RESPECT TO CARRY IT THROUGH AND LITTLE AS I LIKED THE SOUND OF WHAT I HEARD
204-162375-0016 AND SLOW AS I BEGAN TO TRAVEL I STILL KEPT ASKING MY WAY AND STILL KEPT ADVANCING
204-162375-0017 AND SHE WHEN I HAD PUT MY USUAL QUESTION TURNED SHARP ABOUT
204-162375-0018 AND POINTED TO A GREAT BULK OF BUILDING STANDING VERY BARE UPON A GREEN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE NEXT VALLEY THE COUNTRY WAS PLEASANT ROUND ABOUT RUNNING IN LOW HILLS PLEASANTLY WATERED AND WOODED AND THE CROPS TO MY EYES WONDERFULLY GOOD
204-162375-0019 NO ROAD LED UP TO IT NO SMOKE AROSE FROM ANY OF THE CHIMNEYS NOR WAS THERE ANY SEMBLANCE OF A GARDEN MY HEART SANK THAT I CRIED THE WOMAN'S FACE LIT UP WITH A MALIGNANT ANGER
204-162375-0020 THAT IS THE HOUSE OF SHAWS SHE CRIED BLOOD BUILT IT BLOOD STOPPED THE BUILDING OF IT BLOOD SHALL BRING IT DOWN SEE HERE SHE CRIED AGAIN I SPIT UPON THE GROUND AND CRACK MY THUMB AT IT BLACK BE ITS FALL
204-162375-0021 IF YE SEE THE LAIRD TELL HIM WHAT YE HEAR TELL HIM THIS MAKES THE TWELVE HUNNER AND NINETEEN TIME THAT JENNET CLOUSTON HAS CALLED DOWN THE CURSE ON HIM AND HIS HOUSE BYRE AND STABLE MAN GUEST AND MASTER WIFE MISS OR BAIRN
204-162375-0022 IN THOSE DAYS FOLK STILL BELIEVED IN WITCHES AND TREMBLED AT A CURSE AND THIS ONE FALLING SO PAT LIKE A WAYSIDE OMEN TO ARREST ME ERE I CARRIED OUT MY PURPOSE TOOK THE PITH OUT OF MY LEGS
204-162375-0023 AND THEN RIGHT UP AGAINST THE YELLOW SKY I SAW A SCROLL OF SMOKE GO MOUNTING NOT MUCH THICKER AS IT SEEMED TO ME THAN THE SMOKE OF A CANDLE BUT STILL THERE IT WAS AND MEANT A FIRE AND WARMTH AND COOKERY
204-162375-0024 YET I SAW NO OTHER PRESENTLY IT BROUGHT ME TO STONE UPRIGHTS WITH AN UNROOFED LODGE BESIDE THEM AND COATS OF ARMS UPON THE TOP A MAIN ENTRANCE IT WAS PLAINLY MEANT TO BE BUT NEVER FINISHED INSTEAD OF GATES OF WROUGHT IRON
204-162375-0025 IT SEEMED LIKE THE ONE WING OF A HOUSE THAT HAD NEVER BEEN FINISHED WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE INNER END STOOD OPEN ON THE UPPER FLOORS AND SHOWED AGAINST THE SKY WITH STEPS AND STAIRS OF UNCOMPLETED MASONRY MANY OF THE WINDOWS WERE UNGLAZED
204-162375-0026 AND BATS FLEW IN AND OUT LIKE DOVES OUT OF A DOVE COTE THE NIGHT HAD BEGUN TO FALL AS I GOT CLOSE AND IN THREE OF THE LOWER WINDOWS WHICH WERE VERY HIGH UP AND NARROW AND WELL BARRED THE CHANGING LIGHT OF A LITTLE FIRE BEGAN TO GLIMMER
204-162375-0027 WAS THIS THE PALACE I HAD BEEN COMING TO WAS IT WITHIN THESE WALLS THAT I WAS TO SEEK NEW FRIENDS AND BEGIN GREAT FORTUNES WHY IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE ON ESSEN WATERSIDE
204-162375-0028 THE FIRE AND THE BRIGHT LIGHTS WOULD SHOW A MILE AWAY AND THE DOOR OPEN TO A BEGGAR'S KNOCK I CAME FORWARD CAUTIOUSLY
204-162375-0029 BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND OF SPEECH AND NOT A DOG BARKED
204-162375-0030 BY THIS TIME MY EARS HAD GROWN SO ACCUSTOMED TO THE QUIET THAT I COULD HEAR THE TICKING OF THE CLOCK INSIDE AS IT SLOWLY COUNTED OUT THE SECONDS BUT WHOEVER WAS IN THAT HOUSE KEPT DEADLY STILL AND MUST HAVE HELD HIS BREATH
204-162375-0031 I WAS IN TWO MINDS WHETHER TO RUN AWAY BUT ANGER GOT THE UPPER HAND AND I BEGAN INSTEAD TO RAIN KICKS AND BUFFETS ON THE DOOR
204-162375-0032 I WAS IN FULL CAREER WHEN I HEARD THE COUGH RIGHT OVERHEAD AND JUMPING BACK AND LOOKING UP BEHELD A MAN'S HEAD IN A TALL NIGHTCAP AND THE BELL MOUTH OF A BLUNDERBUSS AT ONE OF THE FIRST STOREY WINDOWS IT'S LOADED
204-162375-0033 SAID A VOICE I HAVE COME HERE WITH A LETTER I SAID TO MISTER EBENEZER BALFOUR OF SHAWS IS HE HERE FROM WHOM IS IT ASKED THE MAN WITH THE BLUNDERBUSS THAT IS NEITHER HERE NOR THERE
204-162375-0034 SAID I FOR I WAS GROWING VERY WROTH WELL
204-162375-0035 YE CAN PUT IT DOWN UPON THE DOORSTEP AND BE OFF WITH YE I WILL DO NO SUCH THING I CRIED I WILL DELIVER IT INTO MISTER BALFOUR'S HANDS AS IT WAS MEANT I SHOULD IT IS A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION A WHAT
204-162375-0036 CRIED THE VOICE SHARPLY I REPEATED WHAT I HAD SAID WHO ARE YE YOURSELF
204-162375-0037 I AM NOT ASHAMED OF MY NAME SAID I THEY CALL ME DAVID BALFOUR AT THAT I MADE SURE THE MAN STARTED
204-162375-0038 AND WITH A CURIOUS CHANGE OF VOICE THAT THE NEXT QUESTION FOLLOWED
204-162375-0039 I WAS SO MUCH SURPRISED AT THIS THAT I COULD FIND NO VOICE TO ANSWER BUT STOOD STARING AY THE MAN RESUMED HE'LL BE DEAD NO DOUBT AND THAT'LL BE WHAT BRINGS YE CHAPPING TO MY DOOR
204-162375-0040 ANOTHER PAUSE AND THEN DEFIANTLY
