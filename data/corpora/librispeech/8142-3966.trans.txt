8142-3966-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE BEACON GENJI WELL REMEMBERED THE DREAM WHICH HE HAD DREAMT AT SUMA AND IN WHICH HIS FATHER THE LATE EX EMPEROR HAD MADE A FAINT ALLUSION TO HIS FALLEN STATE
8142-3966-0001 HE WAS ALWAYS THINKING OF HAVING SOLEMN SERVICE PERFORMED FOR HIM WHICH MIGHT PROVE TO BE A REMEDY FOR EVILS HE WAS NOW IN THE CAPITAL AND AT LIBERTY TO DO ANYTHING HE WISHED
8142-3966-0002 IN OCTOBER THEREFORE HE ORDERED THE GRAND CEREMONY OF MIHAKKO TO BE PERFORMED FOR THE REPOSE OF THE DEAD MEANWHILE THE RESPECT OF THE PUBLIC TOWARDS GENJI HAD NOW RETURNED TO ITS FORMER STATE
8142-3966-0003 AND HE HIMSELF HAD BECOME A DISTINGUISHED PERSONAGE IN THE CAPITAL THE EMPRESS MOTHER THOUGH INDISPOSED REGRETTED SHE HAD NOT RUINED GENJI ALTOGETHER WHILE THE EMPEROR WHO HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THE INJUNCTION OF THE LATE EX EMPEROR
8142-3966-0004 FELT SATISFIED WITH HIS RECENT DISPOSITION TOWARDS HIS HALF BROTHER WHICH HE BELIEVED TO BE AN ACT OF GOODNESS THIS HE FELT THE MORE
8142-3966-0005 HE DID NOT HOWEVER BELIEVE HE SHOULD BE LONG ON THE THRONE AND WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF LONELY HE OFTEN SENT FOR GENJI AND SPENT HOURS CONVERSING WITH HIM WITHOUT ANY RESERVE ON PUBLIC AFFAIRS
8142-3966-0006 THE NEW REIGN OPENED WITH SEVERAL CHANGES IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS GENJI HAD BEEN MADE NAIDAIJIN
8142-3966-0007 OR THE UDAIJIN HE WAS TO TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN THE ADMINISTRATION BUT AS HE WAS NOT YET DISPOSED TO ENGAGE IN THE BUSY CARES OF OFFICIAL LIFE
8142-3966-0008 HE AT FIRST DECLINED TO ACCEPT THE OFFICE ON THE GROUND THAT HE WAS ADVANCED IN AGE THAT HE HAD ALREADY RETIRED FROM OFFICIAL LIFE AND THAT THE DECLINE OF HIS LIFE LEFT HIM INSUFFICIENT ENERGY THERE WAS HOWEVER AN EXAMPLE IN A FOREIGN STATE
8142-3966-0009 WHEN THEIR COUNTRY WAS IN A DISTURBED STATE CAME FORTH FROM THEIR RETREAT WITH THEIR SNOW CROWNED HEADS AND TOOK PART IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF AFFAIRS NOR WAS IT AN UNUSUAL THING FOR A STATESMAN WHO HAD RETIRED FROM POLITICAL SCENES TO ASSUME AGAIN A PLACE UNDER ANOTHER GOVERNMENT
8142-3966-0010 AND HENCE WHEN HE ACCEPTED HIS NEW POST HE AT ONCE SHOWED HOW CAPABLE HE WAS OF BEING A RESPONSIBLE MINISTER TO NO CHIUJIO HIS ELDEST SON WAS ALSO MADE THE GON CHIUNAGON HIS DAUGHTER BY HIS WIFE
8142-3966-0011 THE FOURTH DAUGHTER OF UDAIJIN WAS NOW TWELVE YEARS OLD AND WAS SHORTLY EXPECTED TO BE PRESENTED AT COURT WHILE HIS SON WHO HAD SUNG THE HIGH SAND AT A SUMMER DAY REUNION AT GENJI'S MANSION RECEIVED A TITLE
8142-3966-0012 THE YOUNG GENJI TOO THE SON OF THE LATE LADY AOI WAS ADMITTED TO THE COURT OF THE EMPEROR AND OF THE HEIR APPARENT THE ATTENDANTS WHO FAITHFULLY SERVED THE YOUNG GENJI AND THOSE IN THE MANSION AT NIJIO
8142-3966-0013 HAD ALL RECEIVED A SATISFACTORY TOKEN OF APPRECIATION FROM GENJI WHO NOW BEGAN TO HAVE A MANSION REPAIRED
8142-3966-0014 AND WHICH HAD FORMERLY BELONGED TO HIS FATHER THIS HE DID WITH A NOTION OF PLACING THERE SOME OF HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS
8142-3966-0015 HE DESPATCHED A MESSENGER THERE ON THE FIRST OF MARCH AS HE DEEMED THE HAPPY EVENT WOULD TAKE PLACE ABOUT THAT TIME WHEN THE MESSENGER RETURNED HE REPORTED THAT SHE WAS SAFELY DELIVERED OF A GIRL ON THE SIXTEENTH OF THE MONTH
8142-3966-0016 HE REMEMBERED THE PREDICTION OF AN ASTROLOGER WHO HAD TOLD HIM THAT AN EMPEROR WOULD BE BORN TO HIM AND ANOTHER SON WHO WOULD EVENTUALLY BECOME A DAJIODAIJIN HE ALSO REMEMBERED THAT A DAUGHTER
8142-3966-0017 WHEN HE REFLECTED ON THIS PREDICTION AND ON THE SERIES OF EVENTS
8142-3966-0018 AND AS HE THOUGHT OF SENDING FOR HER AS SOON AS THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG MOTHER'S HEALTH WOULD ADMIT HE HURRIED FORWARD THE REPAIRS OF THE EASTERN MANSION HE ALSO THOUGHT THAT AS THERE MIGHT NOT BE A SUITABLE NURSE AT AKASHI FOR THE CHILD
8142-3966-0019 WHEN SHE ARRIVED THE PRIEST WAS INTENSELY DELIGHTED AND THE YOUNG MOTHER WHO HAD BEEN GRADUALLY IMPROVING IN HEALTH FELT GREAT CONSOLATION THE CHILD WAS VERY HEALTHY AND THE NURSE AT ONCE BEGAN TO DISCHARGE HER DUTIES MOST FAITHFULLY
8142-3966-0020 HITHERTO GENJI DID NOT CONFIDE THE STORY OF HIS RELATIONS WITH THE MAIDEN OF AKASHI TO VIOLET BUT HE THOUGHT HE HAD BETTER DO SO AS THE MATTER MIGHT NATURALLY REACH HER EARS HE NOW THEREFORE INFORMED HER OF ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND OF THE BIRTH OF THE CHILD SAYING
8142-3966-0021 IF YOU FEEL ANY UNPLEASANTNESS ABOUT THE MATTER I CANNOT BLAME YOU IN ANY WAY IT WAS NOT THE BLESSING WHICH I DESIRED HOW GREATLY DO I REGRET THAT IN THE QUARTER WHERE I WISHED TO SEE THE HEAVENLY GIFT THERE IS NONE BUT SEE IT IN ANOTHER
8142-3966-0022 WHERE THERE WAS NO EXPECTATION THE CHILD IS MERELY A GIRL TOO AND I ALMOST THINK THAT I NEED PAY NO FURTHER ATTENTION BUT THIS WOULD MAKE ME HEARTLESS TOWARDS MY UNDOUBTED OFFSPRING I SHALL SEND FOR IT AND SHOW IT TO YOU AND HOPE YOU WILL BE GENEROUS TO HER
8142-3966-0023 PRAY DON'T ATTRIBUTE ANY BLAME TO ME I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT HOW MISERABLE AM I AND HE BEGAN TO DROP TEARS WHEN HE CAME TO REFLECT HOW FAITHFUL SHE HAD BEEN ALL THE TIME AND HOW AFFECTIONATE AND ALSO HOW REGULAR HAD BEEN HER CORRESPONDENCE
8142-3966-0024 HE FELT SORRY FOR HER AND CONTINUED IN MY ANXIOUS THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS CHILD I HAVE SOME INTENTIONS WHICH MAY BE AGREEABLE TO YOU ALSO ONLY I WILL NOT TELL YOU TOO HASTILY SINCE IF I DO SO NOW THEY MIGHT NOT BE TAKEN IN A FAVORABLE LIGHT
8142-3966-0025 THE ATTRACTIONS OF THE MOTHER SEEM ONLY TO HAVE ARISEN FROM THE POSITION IN WHICH SHE WAS PLACED YOU MUST NOT THINK OF THE MATTER TOO SERIOUSLY
8142-3966-0026 HE THEN BRIEFLY SKETCHED HER CHARACTER AND HER SKILL IN MUSIC BUT ON THE PART OF VIOLET SHE COULD NOT BUT THINK THAT IT WAS CRUEL TO HER TO GIVE AWAY PART OF HIS HEART WHILE HER THOUGHTS WERE WITH NO ONE BUT HIM AND SHE WAS QUITE CAST DOWN FOR SOME TIME
8142-3966-0027 GENJI TRIED TO CONSOLE HER HE TOOK UP A KIN AND ASKED HER TO PLAY AND SING WITH HIM BUT SHE DID NOT TOUCH IT SAYING THAT SHE COULD NOT PLAY IT SO WELL AS THE MAIDEN OF AKASHI
8142-3966-0028 THE FIFTH OF MAY WAS THE FIFTIETH DAY OF THE BIRTH OF THE CHILD SO GENJI SENT A MESSENGER TO AKASHI A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE TIME WHEN HE WOULD BE EXPECTED
8142-3966-0029 A LIBERAL ALLOWANCE WAS GRANTED TO HER AND A BECOMING HOUSEHOLD WAS ESTABLISHED FOR HER PRIVATE USE SHE HOWEVER STILL CONTINUED HER DEVOTION TO RELIGION NOW AND THEN COMING TO COURT TO SEE HER SON WHERE SHE WAS RECEIVED WITH ALL CORDIALITY SO THAT HER RIVAL
8142-3966-0030 THE MOTHER OF THE EX EMPEROR WHOSE INFLUENCE WAS OVERWHELMING TILL LATELY NOW BEGAN TO FEEL LIKE ONE TO WHOM THE WORLD HAD BECOME IRKSOME IN THE MEANTIME PUBLIC AFFAIRS ENTIRELY CHANGED THEIR ASPECTS
8142-3966-0031 AND HIS SON IN LAW GENJI BY WHOSE INFLUENCE ALL THINGS IN PUBLIC WERE SWAYED IN AUGUST OF THIS YEAR THE DAUGHTER OF GON CHIUNAGON FORMERLY TO NO CHIUJIO WAS INTRODUCED AT COURT SHE TOOK UP HER ABODE IN THE KOKIDEN
8142-3966-0032 BUT GENJI TOOK NO INTEREST IN THIS WHAT WILL HE EVENTUALLY DO ABOUT THIS MATTER IN THE SAME AUTUMN GENJI WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF SUMIYOSHI TO FULFIL HIS VOWS
8142-3966-0033 HIS PARTY CONSISTED OF MANY YOUNG NOBLES AND COURT RETAINERS BESIDES HIS OWN PRIVATE ATTENDANTS BY A COINCIDENCE THE MAIDEN OF AKASHI WHO HAD BEEN PREVENTED FROM COMING TO THE TEMPLE SINCE THE LAST YEAR HAPPENED TO ARRIVE THERE ON THE SAME DAY
8142-3966-0034 AND KOREMITZ IN FINE UNIFORMS OF DIFFERENT COLORS BLUE GREEN OR SCARLET ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT RANKS FORMED THE PROCESSION CONTRASTING WITH THE HUE OF THE RANGE OF PINE TREES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD
8142-3966-0035 GENJI WAS IN A CARRIAGE WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY TEN BOY PAGES GRANTED BY THE COURT IN THE SAME WAY AS A LATE SADAIJIN KAWARA HAD BEEN HONORED
8142-3966-0036 THE MAIDEN OF AKASHI WITNESSED THE PROCESSION BUT SHE AVOIDED MAKING HERSELF KNOWN SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD BETTER NOT GO UP TO THE TEMPLE ON THAT DAY BUT SHE COULD NOT SAIL BACK TO AKASHI
8142-3966-0037 FOR THE NIGHT AS TO GENJI HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE MAIDEN BEING A SPECTATOR OF THE PROCESSION AND SPENT THE WHOLE NIGHT IN THE TEMPLE WITH HIS PARTY IN PERFORMING SERVICES WHICH MIGHT PLEASE THE GOD
8142-3966-0038 AND AS YON BEACON MEETS OUR EYE TO DREAM PERCHANCE OF DAYS GONE BY A FEW WORDS MORE THE CHANGE OF THE RULER HAD BROUGHT A CHANGE OF THE SAIGU AND THE LADY OF ROKJIO WITH HER DAUGHTER RETURNED TO THE CAPITAL
8142-3966-0039 HER HEALTH HOWEVER BEGAN TO FAIL AND SHE BECAME A NUN AND AFTER SOME TIME DIED
