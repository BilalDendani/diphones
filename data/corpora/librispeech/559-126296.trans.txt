559-126296-0025 AND AS THEY WERE SO WEARY THAT THEIR LEGS WOULD CARRY THEM NO LONGER THEY LAY DOWN BENEATH A TREE AND FELL ASLEEP IT WAS NOW THREE MORNINGS SINCE THEY HAD LEFT THEIR FATHER'S HOUSE
559-126296-0026 THEY SAW A BEAUTIFUL SNOW WHITE BIRD SITTING ON A BOUGH WHICH SANG SO DELIGHTFULLY THAT THEY STOOD STILL AND LISTENED TO IT AND WHEN ITS SONG WAS OVER IT SPREAD ITS WINGS AND FLEW AWAY BEFORE THEM
559-126296-0027 AND BROKE OFF A LITTLE OF THE ROOF TO TRY HOW IT TASTED AND GRETEL LEANT AGAINST THE WINDOW AND NIBBLED AT THE PANES THEN A SOFT VOICE CRIED FROM THE PARLOUR NIBBLE NIBBLE GNAW

559-126296-0033 HAD ONLY PRETENDED TO BE SO KIND SHE WAS IN REALITY A WICKED WITCH WHO LAY IN WAIT FOR CHILDREN AND HAD ONLY BUILT THE LITTLE HOUSE OF BREAD IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM THERE

559-126296-0049 AND DANCE ABOUT AND KISS EACH OTHER AND AS THEY HAD NO LONGER ANY NEED TO FEAR HER THEY WENT INTO THE WITCH'S HOUSE AND IN EVERY CORNER THERE STOOD CHESTS FULL OF PEARLS AND JEWELS
559-126296-0050 THESE ARE FAR BETTER THAN PEBBLES SAID HANSEL AND THRUST INTO HIS POCKETS WHATEVER COULD BE GOT IN AND GRETEL SAID I TOO WILL TAKE SOMETHING HOME WITH ME AND FILLED HER PINAFORE FULL
