3675-185514-0000 WITCHCRAFT NEW YORK WITCHES THE WITCH MANIA HOW FAST THEY BURNED THEM THE MODE OF TRIAL WITCHES TO DAY IN EUROPE
3675-185514-0001 WITCHCRAFT IS ONE OF THE MOST BASELESS ABSURD DISGUSTING AND SILLY OF ALL THE HUMBUGS AND IT IS NOT A DEAD HUMBUG EITHER IT IS ALIVE BUSILY EXERCISED BY KNAVES AND BELIEVED BY FOOLS ALL OVER THE WORLD
3675-185514-0002 WITCHES AND WIZARDS OPERATE AND PROSPER AMONG THE HOTTENTOTS AND NEGROES AND BARBAROUS INDIANS
3675-185514-0003 THEY ARE IF THE BELIEF AND PRACTICE OF WITCHCRAFT AMONG THEM IS ANY TEST FOR IN ALL THOSE COUNTRIES THERE ARE WITCHES I TAKE UP ONE OF THE NEW YORK CITY DAILIES OF THIS VERY MORNING AND FIND IN IT THE ADVERTISEMENTS OF SEVEN WITCHES
3675-185514-0004 IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT THERE WERE IN FULL BLAST IN NEW YORK AND BROOKLYN SIXTEEN WITCHES AND TWO WIZARDS ONE OF THESE WIZARDS WAS A BLACK MAN A VERY PROPER STYLE OF PERSON TO DEAL WITH THE BLACK ART WITCH MEANS
3675-185514-0005 BEFORE THE CHRISTIAN ERA THE JEWISH WITCH WAS A MERE DIVINER OR AT MOST A RAISER OF THE DEAD AND THE GENTILE WITCH WAS A POISONER A MAKER OF PHILTRES OR LOVE POTIONS AND A VULGAR SORT OF MAGICIAN
3675-185514-0006 THE DEVIL PART OF THE BUSINESS DID NOT BEGIN UNTIL A GOOD WHILE AFTER CHRIST DURING THE LAST CENTURY OR SO AGAIN WHILE WITCHCRAFT HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY BELIEVED IN THE WITCH HAS DEGENERATED INTO A VERY VULGAR AND POVERTY STRICKEN SORT OF CONJURING WOMAN
3675-185514-0007 TAKE OUR NEW YORK CITY WITCHES FOR INSTANCE THEY LIVE IN CHEAP AND DIRTY STREETS THAT SMELL BAD THEIR HOUSES ARE IN THE SAME STYLE INFECTED WITH A STRONG ODOR OF CABBAGE ONIONS WASHING DAY
3675-185514-0008 OLD DINNERS AND OTHER MERELY SUBLUNARY SMELLS THEIR ROOMS ARE VERY ILL FURNISHED AND OFTEN BESET WITH WASH TUBS SWILL PAILS MOPS AND SOILED CLOTHES THEIR PERSONAL APPEARANCE IS COMMONLY UNCLEAN HOMELY VULGAR
3675-185514-0009 COARSE AND IGNORANT AND OFTEN RUMMY THEIR FEE IS A QUARTER OR HALF OF A DOLLAR SOMETIMES A DOLLAR THEIR DIVINATION IS WORKED BY CUTTING AND DEALING CARDS OR STUDYING THE PALM OF YOUR HAND
3675-185514-0010 AND THE THINGS WHICH THEY TELL YOU ARE THE MOST SILLY AND SHALLOW BABBLE IN THE WORLD A MESS OF PHRASES WORN OUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
3675-185514-0011 ANYBODY CAN DO THE LIKE YOU FACE A MISFORTUNE I THINK IT WILL COME UPON YOU WITHIN THREE WEEKS BUT IT MAY NOT A DARK COMPLEXIONED MAN FACES YOUR LIFE CARD
3675-185514-0012 HE IS PLOTTING AGAINST YOU AND YOU MUST BEWARE OF HIM YOUR MARRIAGE CARD FACES TWO YOUNG WOMEN ONE FAIR AND THE OTHER DARK ONE YOU WILL HAVE AND THE OTHER YOU WILL NOT I THINK YOU WILL HAVE THE FAIR ONE
3675-185514-0013 SHE FAVORS THE DARK COMPLEXIONED MAN WHICH MEANS TROUBLE YOU FACE MONEY BUT YOU MUST EARN IT THERE IS A GOOD DEAL BUT YOU MAY NOT GET MUCH OF IT ET CETERA ET CETERA
3675-185514-0014 THESE WORDS ARE EXACTLY THE SORT OF STUFF THAT IS SOLD BY THE WITCHES OF TO DAY BUT THE GREATEST WITCH HUMBUG OF ALL THE WITCHCRAFT OF HISTORY IS THAT OF CHRISTENDOM FOR ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS BEGINNING ABOUT THE TIME OF THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA
3675-185514-0015 TO THAT PERIOD BELONGED THE SALEM WITCHCRAFT OF NEW ENGLAND THE WITCH FINDING OF MATTHEW HOPKINS IN OLD ENGLAND THE SCOTCH WITCH TRIALS AND THE SWEDISH AND GERMAN AND FRENCH WITCH MANIA
3675-185514-0016 THE PECULIAR TRAITS OF THE WITCHCRAFT OF THIS PERIOD ARE AMONG THE MOST MYSTERIOUS OF ALL HUMBUGS THE MOST USUAL POINTS IN A CASE OF WITCHCRAFT WERE THAT THE WITCH HAD SOLD HERSELF TO THE DEVIL FOR ALL ETERNITY
3675-185514-0017 IN ORDER TO GET THE POWER DURING A FEW YEARS OF EARTHLY LIFE TO INFLICT A FEW PAINS ON THE PERSONS OF THOSE SHE DISLIKED OR TO CAUSE THEM TO LOSE PART OF THEIR PROPERTY THIS WAS ALMOST ALWAYS THE WHOLE STORY
3675-185514-0018 PARODIES ON THE CEREMONIES OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION
3675-185514-0019 HOW ANYBODY COULD BELIEVE THAT TO ACCOMPLISH SUCH VERY SMALL RESULTS SELDOM EQUAL EVEN TO THE DEATH OF AN ENEMY ONE WOULD AGREE TO ACCEPT ETERNAL DAMNATION IN THE NEXT WORLD ALMOST CERTAIN POVERTY MISERY PERSECUTION AND TORMENT IN THIS
3675-185514-0020 BESIDES HAVING FOR AN AMUSEMENT PERFORMANCES MORE DIRTY OBSCENE AND VULGAR THAN I CAN EVEN HINT AT BUT SUCH A BELIEF WAS UNIVERSAL AND HUNDREDS OF THE WITCHES THEMSELVES CONFESSED AS MUCH AS I HAVE DESCRIBED AND MORE
3675-185514-0021 WITH NUMEROUS DETAILS AND THEY WERE BURNT ALIVE FOR THEIR TROUBLE THE EXTENT OF WHOLESALE MURDERING PERPETRATED UNDER FORMS OF LAW ON CHARGES OF WITCHCRAFT IS ASTONISHING A MAGISTRATE NAMED REMIGIUS PUBLISHED A BOOK
3675-185514-0022 IN WHICH HE TOLD HOW MUCH HE THOUGHT OF HIMSELF FOR HAVING CONDEMNED AND BURNED NINE HUNDRED WITCHES IN SIXTEEN YEARS IN LORRAINE AND THE ONE THING THAT HE BLAMED HIMSELF FOR WAS THIS THAT OUT OF REGARD FOR THE WISHES OF A COLLEAGUE
3675-185514-0023 AT WURZBURG NINE HUNDRED IN TWO YEARS SPRENGER A GERMAN INQUISITOR GENERAL AND AUTHOR OF A CELEBRATED BOOK ON DETECTING AND PUNISHING WITCHCRAFT CALLED MALLEUS MALEFICARUM OR THE MALLET OF MALEFACTORS
3675-185514-0024 BURNED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED IN ONE YEAR IN GENEVA FIVE HUNDRED PERSONS WERE BURNED DURING FIFTEEN FIFTEEN AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN
3675-185514-0025 IN THE DISTRICT OF COMO IN ITALY A THOUSAND PERSONS WERE BURNED AS WITCHES IN THE SINGLE YEAR FIFTEEN TWENTY FOUR BESIDES OVER A HUNDRED A YEAR FOR SEVERAL YEARS AFTERWARDS
3675-185514-0026 SEVENTEEN THOUSAND PERSONS WERE EXECUTED FOR WITCHCRAFT IN SCOTLAND DURING THIRTY NINE YEARS ENDING WITH SIXTEEN O THREE FORTY THOUSAND WERE EXECUTED IN ENGLAND FROM SIXTEEN HUNDRED TO SIXTEEN EIGHTY
3675-185514-0027 BODINUS ANOTHER OF THE WITCH KILLING JUDGES GRAVELY ANNOUNCED THAT THERE WERE UNDOUBTEDLY NOT LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND WITCHES IN FRANCE THE WAY IN WHICH THE WITCH MURDERERS REASONED AND THEIR MODES OF CONDUCTING TRIALS AND PROCURING CONFESSIONS
3675-185514-0028 WERE TRULY INFERNAL THE CHIEF RULE WAS THAT WITCHCRAFT BEING AN EXCEPTIONAL CRIME NO REGARD NEED BE HAD TO THE ORDINARY FORMS OF JUSTICE ALL MANNER OF TORTURES WERE FREELY APPLIED TO FORCE CONFESSIONS
3675-185514-0029 IN SCOTLAND THE BOOT WAS USED BEING AN IRON CASE IN WHICH THE LEGS ARE LOCKED UP TO THE KNEES AND AN IRON WEDGE THEN DRIVEN IN UNTIL SOMETIMES THE BONES WERE CRUSHED AND THE MARROW SPOUTED OUT PIN STICKING DROWNING
3675-185514-0030 STARVING THE RACK WERE TOO COMMON TO NEED DETAILS SOMETIMES THE PRISONER WAS HUNG UP BY THE THUMBS AND WHIPPED BY ONE PERSON
3675-185514-0031 AT ARRAS WHILE THE PRISONERS WERE BEING TORN ON THE RACK THE EXECUTIONER STOOD BY SWORD IN HAND PROMISING TO CUT OFF AT ONCE THE HEADS OF THOSE WHO DID NOT CONFESS
3675-185514-0032 AT OFFENBURG WHEN THE PRISONERS HAD BEEN TORTURED UNTIL BEYOND THE POWER OF SPEAKING ALOUD THEY SILENTLY ASSENTED TO ABOMINABLE CONFESSIONS READ TO THEM OUT OF A BOOK
3675-185514-0033 MANY WERE CHEATED INTO CONFESSION BY THE PROMISE OF PARDON AND RELEASE AND THEN BURNED A POOR WOMAN IN GERMANY WAS TRICKED BY THE HANGMAN WHO DRESSED HIMSELF UP AS A DEVIL AND WENT INTO HER CELL OVERPOWERED BY PAIN
3675-185514-0034 FEAR AND SUPERSTITION SHE BEGGED HIM TO HELP HER OUT HER BESEECHING WAS TAKEN FOR CONFESSION SHE WAS BURNED AND A BALLAD WHICH TREATED THE TRICK AS A JOLLY AND COMICAL DEVICE WAS LONG POPULAR IN THE COUNTRY
3675-185514-0035 CONFESSED WHATEVER WAS REQUIRED
3675-185514-0036 ALL WHO DARED TO ARGUE AGAINST THE CURRENT OF POPULAR AND JUDICIAL DELUSION WERE INSTANTLY REFUTED VERY EFFECTIVELY BY BEING ATTACKED FOR WITCHCRAFT THEMSELVES AND ONCE ACCUSED THERE WAS LITTLE HOPE OF ESCAPE
3675-185514-0037 THE JESUIT DELRIO IN A BOOK PUBLISHED IN FIFTEEN NINETY NINE STATES THE WITCH KILLERS SIDE OF THE DISCUSSION VERY NEATLY INDEED FOR IN ONE AND THE SAME CHAPTER HE DEFIES ANY OPPONENTS TO DISPROVE THE EXISTENCE OF WITCHCRAFT
3675-185514-0038 AND THEN SHOWS THAT A DENIAL OF WITCHCRAFT IS THE WORST OF ALL HERESIES AND MUST BE PUNISHED WITH DEATH QUITE A NUMBER OF EXCELLENT AND SENSIBLE PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY BURNT ON JUST THIS PRINCIPLE
3675-185514-0039 THIS SKETCH OF THE WAY IN WHICH THEY OPERATED IS ALL I CAN MAKE ROOM FOR AND SUFFICIENTLY DELINEATES THIS CRUEL AND BLOODY HUMBUG I HAVE ALREADY REFERRED TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE RIGHT HERE AMONG US IN THIS CITY A VERY FAIR SUPPLY OF A VULGAR
3675-185514-0040 DOWDY KIND OF WITCHCRAFT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE FAVORED IN LIKE MANNER I HAVE NOT JUST NOW THE MOST RECENT INFORMATION BUT IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN AND EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT FOR INSTANCE
3675-185514-0041 MOBBING AND PROSECUTIONS GROWING OUT OF A POPULAR BELIEF IN WITCHCRAFT WERE QUITE PLENTIFUL ENOUGH IN VARIOUS PARTS OF EUROPE NO LESS THAN EIGHT CASES OF THE KIND IN ENGLAND ALONE WERE REPORTED DURING THOSE TWO YEARS
3675-185514-0042 AMONG THEM WAS THE ACTUAL MURDER OF A WOMAN AS A WITCH BY A MOB IN SHROPSHIRE AND AN ATTACK BY ANOTHER MOB IN ESSEX UPON A PERFECTLY INOFFENSIVE PERSON ON SUSPICION OF HAVING BEWITCHED A SCOLDING ILL CONDITIONED GIRL
3675-185514-0043 FROM WHICH ATTACK THE MOB WAS DIVERTED WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY AND THINKING ITSELF VERY UNJUSTLY TREATED SOME OTHERS OF THOSE CASES SHOW A SINGULAR QUANTITY OF CREDULITY AMONG PEOPLE OF RESPECTABILITY
