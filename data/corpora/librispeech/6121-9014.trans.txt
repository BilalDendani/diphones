6121-9014-0000 BY VIRTUE OF THE WORLD WIDE FREEMASONRY WHICH CHRISTIANITY HAD FOR THE FIRST TIME ON EARTH ESTABLISHED FOUND HIMSELF IN FIVE MINUTES AWAITING THE SUMMONS OF THE MOST POWERFUL MAN SOUTH OF THE MEDITERRANEAN
6121-9014-0001 A CURTAIN HUNG ACROSS THE DOOR OF THE INNER CHAMBER THROUGH WHICH PHILAMMON COULD HEAR PLAINLY THE STEPS OF SOME ONE WALKING UP AND DOWN HURRIEDLY AND FIERCELY THEY WILL DRIVE ME TO IT AT LAST BURST OUT A DEEP SONOROUS VOICE
6121-9014-0002 THEY WILL DRIVE ME TO IT THEIR BLOOD BE ON THEIR OWN HEAD IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO BLASPHEME GOD AND HIS CHURCH
6121-9014-0003 BUT THEY MUST DELIVER MY CLERGY INTO THE HANDS OF THE TYRANT IT WAS SO EVEN IN THE APOSTLES TIME SUGGESTED A SOFTER BUT FAR MORE UNPLEASANT VOICE THEN IT SHALL BE SO NO LONGER GOD HAS GIVEN ME THE POWER TO STOP THEM

6121-9014-0007 HAVE THEY NOT CAUSE ENOUGH THE SOONER I REMOVE ONE OF THEIR TEMPTATIONS THE BETTER LET THE OTHER TEMPTER BEWARE LEST HIS JUDGMENT BE AT HAND THE PREFECT YOUR HOLINESS ASKED THE OTHER VOICE SLILY
6121-9014-0008 AT THIS JUNCTURE PHILAMMON THINKING PERHAPS THAT HE HAD ALREADY HEARD TOO MUCH NOTIFIED HIS PRESENCE BY SOME SLIGHT NOISE AT WHICH THE SECRETARY AS HE SEEMED TO BE
6121-9014-0009 AND SOMEWHAT SHARPLY DEMANDED HIS BUSINESS THE NAMES OF PAMBO AND ARSENIUS HOWEVER SEEMED TO PACIFY HIM AT ONCE AND THE TREMBLING YOUTH WAS USHERED INTO THE PRESENCE OF HIM WHO IN REALITY THOUGH NOT IN NAME
6121-9014-0010 SAT ON THE THRONE OF THE PHARAOHS NOT INDEED IN THEIR OUTWARD POMP THE FURNITURE OF THE CHAMBER WAS BUT A GRADE ABOVE THAT OF THE ARTISAN'S THE DRESS OF THE GREAT MAN WAS COARSE AND SIMPLE IF PERSONAL VANITY PEEPED OUT ANYWHERE
6121-9014-0011 IT WAS IN THE CAREFUL ARRANGEMENT OF THE BUSHY BEARD AND OF THE FEW CURLING LOCKS WHICH THE TONSURE HAD SPARED BUT THE HEIGHT AND MAJESTY OF HIS FIGURE THE STERN AND MASSIVE BEAUTY OF HIS FEATURES THE FLASHING EYE CURLING LIP AND PROJECTING BROW
6121-9014-0012 ALL MARKED HIM AS ONE BORN TO COMMAND AS THE YOUTH ENTERED CYRIL STOPPED SHORT IN HIS WALK AND LOOKING HIM THROUGH AND THROUGH WITH A GLANCE WHICH BURNT UPON HIS CHEEKS LIKE FIRE
6121-9014-0013 AND MADE HIM ALL BUT WISH THE KINDLY EARTH WOULD OPEN AND HIDE HIM TOOK THE LETTERS READ THEM AND THEN BEGAN PHILAMMON

6121-9014-0015 PHILAMMON WALKED TO IT AND OPENED IT THE PAVEMENT WAS FULLY TWENTY FEET BELOW BUT HIS BUSINESS WAS TO OBEY AND NOT TAKE MEASUREMENTS THERE WAS A FLOWER IN THE VASE UPON THE SILL HE QUIETLY REMOVED IT

6121-9014-0028 WHEREOF THE HARBOUR PANORAMA HAD BEEN THE BRIGHT ONE IN SQUALID MISERY FILTH PROFLIGACY IGNORANCE FEROCITY DISCONTENT NEGLECTED IN BODY HOUSE AND SOUL BY THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES
6121-9014-0029 THERE THEY STARVED AND ROTTED HEAP ON HEAP THE MASSES OF THE OLD GREEK POPULATION
6121-9014-0030 AMONG THESE FIERCELY PERHAPS AND FANATICALLY BUT STILL AMONG THEM AND FOR THEM LABOURED THOSE DISTRICT VISITORS NIGHT AND DAY AND SO PHILAMMON TOILED AWAY WITH THEM CARRYING FOOD AND CLOTHING
6121-9014-0031 HELPING SICK TO THE HOSPITAL AND DEAD TO THE BURIAL CLEANING OUT THE INFECTED HOUSES FOR THE FEVER
6121-9014-0032 AND COMFORTING THE DYING WITH THE GOOD NEWS OF FORGIVENESS FROM ABOVE TILL THE LARGER NUMBER HAD TO RETURN TO EVENING SERVICE HE HOWEVER WAS KEPT BY HIS SUPERIOR WATCHING AT A SICK BEDSIDE
6121-9014-0033 AND IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT BEFORE HE GOT HOME AND WAS REPORTED TO PETER THE READER
6121-9014-0034 AS INDEED WITHOUT THE LEAST THOUGHT OF DOING ANYTHING NOBLE OR SELF SACRIFICING HE HAD TRULY DONE BEING A MONK AND SO HE THREW HIMSELF ON A TRUCKLE BED IN ONE OF THE MANY CELLS WHICH OPENED OFF A LONG CORRIDOR
6121-9014-0035 AND FELL FAST ASLEEP IN A MINUTE HE WAS JUST WELTERING ABOUT IN A DREARY DREAM JUMBLE OF GOTHS DANCING WITH DISTRICT VISITORS PELAGIA AS AN ANGEL WITH PEACOCK'S WINGS HYPATIA
6121-9014-0036 WHEN HE WAS AWAKENED BY THE TRAMP OF HURRIED FEET IN THE STREET OUTSIDE AND SHOUTS WHICH GRADUALLY AS HE BECAME CONSCIOUS SHAPED THEMSELVES INTO CRIES OF
6121-9014-0037 ALEXANDER'S CHURCH IS ON FIRE HELP GOOD CHRISTIANS FIRE HELP WHEREAT HE SAT UP IN HIS TRUCKLE BED
6121-9014-0038 TRIED TO RECOLLECT WHERE HE WAS AND HAVING WITH SOME TROUBLE SUCCEEDED THREW ON HIS SHEEPSKIN AND JUMPED UP TO ASK THE NEWS FROM THE DEACONS AND MONKS WHO WERE HURRYING ALONG THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE YES ALEXANDER'S CHURCH WAS ON FIRE AND DOWN THE STAIRS THEY POURED
6121-9014-0039 TO THE BLAZE OF MOON AND STARLIGHT WHICH FLOODED THE STREET AND WALLS AND SHINING ROOFS HUNG BACK A MOMENT THAT HESITATION PROBABLY SAVED HIS LIFE FOR IN AN INSTANT HE SAW A DARK FIGURE SPRING OUT OF THE SHADOW
6121-9014-0040 A LONG KNIFE FLASHED ACROSS HIS EYES AND A PRIEST NEXT TO HIM
6121-9014-0041 THAT START SAVED PHILAMMON QUICK AS A CAT HE LEAPT UPON HIM FELLED HIM TO THE EARTH WITH A SINGLE BLOW TORE THE DAGGER FROM HIS HAND AND SPRANG TO HIS FEET AGAIN
6121-9014-0042 JUST IN TIME TO STRIKE HIS NEW WEAPON FULL INTO THE THIRD PURSUER'S FACE THE MAN PUT HIS HAND TO HIS HEAD AND RECOILED AGAINST A FELLOW RUFFIAN WHO WAS CLOSE ON HIS HEELS
6121-9014-0043 CAME FROM AN UNPRACTISED HAND OR THE YOUNG MONK MIGHT HAVE HAD MORE THAN ONE LIFE TO ANSWER FOR AS IT WAS THEY TURNED AND LIMPED OFF CURSING IN AN UNKNOWN TONGUE AND PHILAMMON FOUND HIMSELF TRIUMPHANT AND ALONE WITH THE TREMBLING NEGRESS AND THE PROSTRATE RUFFIAN WHO
6121-9014-0044 THE NEGRESS WAS KNEELING UNDER THE GATEWAY POURING OUT HER SIMPLE THANKS TO HEAVEN FOR THIS UNEXPECTED DELIVERANCE
6121-9014-0045 AND PHILAMMON WAS ABOUT TO KNEEL TOO WHEN A THOUGHT STRUCK HIM AND COOLLY DESPOILING THE JEW OF HIS SHAWL AND SASH HE HANDED THEM OVER TO THE POOR NEGRESS CONSIDERING THEM FAIRLY ENOUGH AS HIS OWN BY RIGHT OF CONQUEST BUT
6121-9014-0046 LO AND BEHOLD AS SHE WAS OVERWHELMING HIM WITH THANKS A FRESH MOB POURED INTO THE STREET FROM THE UPPER END AND WERE CLOSE ON THEM BEFORE THEY WERE AWARE A FLUSH OF TERROR AND DESPAIR AND THEN A BURST OF JOY AS
6121-9014-0047 BY MINGLED MOONLIGHT AND TORCHLIGHT PHILAMMON DESCRIED PRIESTLY ROBES AND IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE BATTLE THERE BEING NO APPARENT DANGER PETER THE READER WHO SEEMED TO BE ANXIOUS TO PREVENT INQUIRY BY BEGINNING TO TALK AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
6121-9014-0048 SO HE DID SAID PHILAMMON DRAGGING UP HIS CAPTIVE AND HERE IS HIS FELLOW SCOUNDREL WHEREON THE TWO WORTHIES WERE SPEEDILY TIED TOGETHER BY THE ELBOWS AND THE PARTY
6121-9014-0049 MARCHED ON ONCE MORE IN SEARCH OF ALEXANDER'S CHURCH AND THE SUPPOSED CONFLAGRATION PHILAMMON LOOKED ROUND FOR THE NEGRESS BUT SHE HAD VANISHED
6121-9014-0050 TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HER YET HE LONGED TO SEE HER AGAIN AN INTEREST EVEN SOMETHING LIKE AN AFFECTION HAD ALREADY SPRUNG UP IN HIS HEART TOWARD THE POOR SIMPLE CREATURE WHOM HE HAD DELIVERED FROM DEATH
6121-9014-0051 INSTEAD OF THINKING HER UNGRATEFUL FOR NOT STAYING TO TELL WHAT HE HAD DONE FOR HER HE WAS THANKFUL TO HER FOR HAVING SAVED HIS BLUSHES BY DISAPPEARING SO OPPORTUNELY AND HE LONGED TO TELL HER SO TO KNOW IF SHE WAS HURT TO OH
6121-9014-0052 ONLY FOUR DAYS FROM THE LAURA AND A WHOLE REGIMENT OF WOMEN ACQUAINTANCES ALREADY TRUE PROVIDENCE HAVING SENT INTO THE WORLD ABOUT AS MANY WOMEN AS MEN IT MAYBE DIFFICULT TO KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY ALTOGETHER
6121-9014-0053 PERHAPS TOO PROVIDENCE MAY HAVE INTENDED THEM TO BE OF SOME USE TO THAT OTHER SEX WITH WHOM IT HAS SO MIXED THEM UP DON'T ARGUE POOR PHILAMMON ALEXANDER'S CHURCH IS ON FIRE FORWARD
6121-9014-0054 AND SO THEY HURRIED ON A CONFUSED MASS OF MONKS AND POPULACE WITH THEIR HAPLESS PRISONERS IN THE CENTRE WHO HAULED CUFFED QUESTIONED AND CURSED BY TWENTY SELF ELECTED INQUISITORS AT ONCE THOUGHT FIT
6121-9014-0055 EITHER FROM JEWISH OBSTINACY OR SHEER BEWILDERMENT TO GIVE NO ACCOUNT WHATSOEVER OF THEMSELVES AS THEY TURNED THE CORNER OF A STREET THE FOLDING DOORS OF A LARGE GATEWAY ROLLED OPEN
6121-9014-0056 A LONG LINE OF GLITTERING FIGURES POURED ACROSS THE ROAD DROPPED THEIR SPEAR BUTTS ON THE PAVEMENT WITH A SINGLE RATTLE AND REMAINED MOTIONLESS THE FRONT RANK OF THE MOB RECOILED AND AN AWE STRUCK WHISPER RAN THROUGH THEM THE STATIONARIES
6121-9014-0057 WHO ARE THEY ASKED PHILAMMON IN A WHISPER THE SOLDIERS THE ROMAN SOLDIERS ANSWERED A WHISPERER TO HIM PHILAMMON WHO WAS AMONG THE LEADERS HAD RECOILED TOO HE HARDLY KNEW WHY AT THAT STERN APPARITION
6121-9014-0058 HIS NEXT INSTINCT WAS TO PRESS FORWARD AS CLOSE AS HE DARED AND THESE WERE ROMAN SOLDIERS THE CONQUERORS OF THE WORLD
6121-9014-0059 DIMLY HEARD OF UP THERE IN THE LONELY LAURA ROMAN SOLDIERS AND HERE HE WAS FACE TO FACE WITH THEM AT LAST HIS CURIOSITY RECEIVED A SUDDEN CHECK HOWEVER
6121-9014-0060 AS HE FOUND HIS ARM SEIZED BY AN OFFICER AS HE TOOK HIM TO BE FROM THE GOLD ORNAMENTS ON HIS HELMET AND CUIRASS WHO LIFTED HIS VINE STOCK THREATENINGLY OVER THE YOUNG MONK'S HEAD AND DEMANDED WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT
6121-9014-0061 WHY ARE YOU NOT QUIETLY IN YOUR BEDS YOU ALEXANDRIAN RASCALS ALEXANDER'S CHURCH IS ON FIRE ANSWERED PHILAMMON THINKING THE SHORTEST ANSWER THE WISEST SO MUCH THE BETTER AND THE JEWS ARE MURDERING THE CHRISTIANS
6121-9014-0062 FIGHT IT OUT THEN TURN IN MEN IT'S ONLY A RIOT AND THE STEEL CLAD APPARITION SUDDENLY FLASHED ROUND AND VANISHED TRAMPLING AND JINGLING INTO THE DARK JAWS OF THE GUARDHOUSE GATE WHILE THE STREAM ITS TEMPORARY BARRIER REMOVED
6121-9014-0063 RUSHED ON WILDER THAN EVER PHILAMMON HURRIED ON TOO WITH THEM NOT WITHOUT A STRANGE FEELING OF DISAPPOINTMENT ONLY A RIOT
6121-9014-0064 PETER WAS CHUCKLING TO HIS BROTHERS OVER THEIR CLEVERNESS IN HAVING KEPT THE PRISONERS IN THE MIDDLE AND STOPPED THE RASCALS MOUTHS TILL THEY WERE PAST THE GUARD HOUSE A FINE THING TO BOAST OF THOUGHT PHILAMMON
6121-9014-0065 ONLY A RIOT HE AND THE CORPS OF DISTRICT VISITORS WHOM HE FANCIED THE MOST AUGUST BODY ON EARTH AND ALEXANDER'S CHURCH CHRISTIANS MURDERED BY JEWS
6121-9014-0066 AND ALL THE REST OF IT WAS SIMPLY THEN NOT WORTH THE NOTICE OF THOSE FORTY MEN ALONE AND SECURE IN THE SENSE OF POWER AND DISCIPLINE AMONG TENS OF THOUSANDS HE HATED THEM THOSE SOLDIERS WAS IT BECAUSE THEY WERE INDIFFERENT TO THE CAUSE OF WHICH HE
6121-9014-0067 WAS INCLINED TO THINK HIMSELF A NOT UNIMPORTANT MEMBER ON THE STRENGTH OF HIS LATE SAMSONIC DEFEAT OF JEWISH PERSECUTORS AT LEAST HE OBEYED THE LITTLE PORTER'S ADVICE AND FELT VERY SMALL INDEED AND HE FELT SMALLER STILL
6121-9014-0068 BEING YOUNG AND ALIVE TO RIDICULE WHEN AT SOME SUDDEN EBB OR FLOW WAVE OR WAVELET OF THE BABEL SEA WHICH WELTERED UP AND DOWN EVERY STREET A SHRILL FEMALE VOICE INFORMED THEM FROM AN UPPER WINDOW THAT ALEXANDER'S CHURCH WAS NOT ON FIRE AT ALL
6121-9014-0069 THAT SHE HAD GONE TO THE TOP OF THE HOUSE AS THEY MIGHT HAVE GONE IF THEY HAD NOT BEEN FOOLS ET CETERA ET CETERA AND THAT IT LOOKED AS SAFE AND AS UGLY AS EVER WHEREWITH A BRICKBAT OR TWO HAVING BEEN SENT UP IN ANSWER SHE SHUT THE BLINDS

6121-9014-0072 AND WHETHER IT WAS OR NOT THERE WERE AMBUSCADES OF JEWS SATAN ONLY KNEW HOW STRONG IN EVERY STREET BETWEEN THEM AND IT MIGHT IT NOT BE BETTER TO SECURE THEIR TWO PRISONERS AND THEN ASK FOR FURTHER ORDERS FROM THE ARCHBISHOP
6121-9014-0073 TILL THOSE OF A CONTRARY OPINION BEGAN TO FIND THEMSELVES LEFT ALONE AND HAVING A STRONG DISLIKE TO JEWISH DAGGERS WERE FAIN TO FOLLOW THE STREAM
6121-9014-0074 IN WHICH ONE OR TWO SEEKING SHELTER FROM THE AWFUL NOTHING IN NEIGHBOURING HOUSES WERE HANDED OVER TO THE WATCH AS BURGLARS AND SENT TO THE QUARRIES ACCORDINGLY THEY REACHED THE SERAPEIUM AND THERE
