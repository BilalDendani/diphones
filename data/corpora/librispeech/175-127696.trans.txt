175-127696-0000 THE TWO LEAVED PINE THE TWO LEAVED PINE PINUS CONTORTA
175-127696-0001 ABOVE THE SILVER FIR ZONE FORMS THE BULK OF THE ALPINE FORESTS UP TO A HEIGHT OF FROM EIGHT THOUSAND
175-127696-0002 GROWING IN BEAUTIFUL ORDER ON MORAINES SCARCELY CHANGED AS YET BY POST GLACIAL WEATHERING COMPARED WITH THE GIANTS OF THE LOWER REGIONS THIS IS A SMALL TREE SELDOM EXCEEDING A HEIGHT OF EIGHTY OR NINETY FEET
175-127696-0003 IT IS A WELL PROPORTIONED RATHER HANDSOME TREE WITH GRAYISH BROWN BARK AND CROOKED MUCH DIVIDED BRANCHES WHICH COVER THE GREATER PART OF THE TRUNK BUT NOT SO DENSELY AS TO PREVENT IT BEING SEEN
175-127696-0004 THE LOWER LIMBS LIKE THOSE OF MOST OTHER CONIFERS THAT GROW IN SNOWY REGIONS CURVE DOWNWARD GRADUALLY TAKE A HORIZONTAL POSITION ABOUT HALF WAY UP THE TRUNK THEN ASPIRE MORE AND MORE TOWARD THE SUMMIT
175-127696-0005 THE SHORT RIGID NEEDLES IN FASCICLES OF TWO ARE ARRANGED IN COMPARATIVELY LONG CYLINDRICAL TASSELS AT THE ENDS OF THE TOUGH UP CURVING BRANCHES THE CONES ARE ABOUT TWO INCHES LONG GROWING IN CLUSTERS AMONG THE NEEDLES
175-127696-0006 WITHOUT ANY STRIKING EFFECT EXCEPT WHILE VERY YOUNG WHEN THE FLOWERS ARE OF A VIVID CRIMSON COLOR AND THE WHOLE TREE APPEARS TO BE DOTTED WITH BRILLIANT FLOWERS THE STAMINATE FLOWERS ARE STILL MORE SHOWY ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR GREAT ABUNDANCE
175-127696-0007 OFTEN GIVING A REDDISH YELLOW TINGE TO THE WHOLE MASS OF FOLIAGE AND FILLING THE AIR WITH POLLEN NO OTHER PINE ON THE RANGE IS SO REGULARLY PLANTED AS THIS ONE COVERING MORAINES THAT EXTEND ALONG THE SIDES OF THE HIGH ROCKY VALLEYS FOR MILES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
175-127696-0008 THE THIN BARK IS STREAKED AND SPRINKLED WITH RESIN AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SHOWERED UPON THE FOREST LIKE RAIN THEREFORE THIS TREE MORE THAN ANY OTHER IS SUBJECT TO DESTRUCTION BY FIRE DURING STRONG WINDS EXTENSIVE FORESTS ARE DESTROYED
175-127696-0009 THE FLAMES LEAPING FROM TREE TO TREE IN CONTINUOUS BELTS THAT GO SURGING AND RACING ONWARD ABOVE THE BENDING WOOD LIKE PRAIRIE GRASS FIRES DURING THE CALM SEASON OF INDIAN SUMMER THE FIRE CREEPS QUIETLY ALONG THE GROUND
175-127696-0010 ARRIVING AT THE FOOT OF A TREE
175-127696-0011 INCREASING IN VELOCITY AND DRAGGING THE FLAMES UPWARD THEN THE LEAVES CATCH FORMING AN IMMENSE COLUMN OF FIRE BEAUTIFULLY SPIRED ON THE EDGES AND TINTED A ROSE PURPLE HUE IT RUSHES ALOFT THIRTY OR FORTY FEET ABOVE THE TOP OF THE TREE
175-127696-0012 LEAVING THE TRUNKS AND BRANCHES SCARCELY SCARRED THE HEAT HOWEVER IS SUFFICIENT TO KILL THE TREE AND IN A FEW YEARS THE BARK SHRIVELS AND FALLS OFF FORESTS MILES IN EXTENT ARE THUS KILLED AND LEFT STANDING
175-127696-0013 WITH THE BRANCHES ON BUT PEELED AND RIGID APPEARING GRAY IN THE DISTANCE LIKE MISTY CLOUDS LATER THE BRANCHES DROP OFF LEAVING A FOREST OF BLEACHED SPARS
175-127696-0014 AT LENGTH THE ROOTS DECAY AND THE FORLORN GRAY TRUNKS ARE BLOWN DOWN DURING SOME STORM AND PILED ONE UPON ANOTHER ENCUMBERING THE GROUND UNTIL DRY AND SEASONED THEY ARE CONSUMED BY ANOTHER FIRE AND LEAVE THE GROUND READY FOR A FRESH CROP
175-127696-0015 IN SHELTERED LAKE HOLLOWS ON BEDS OF ALLUVIUM THIS PINE VARIES SO FAR FROM THE COMMON FORM THAT FREQUENTLY IT COULD BE TAKEN FOR A DISTINCT SPECIES GROWING IN DAMP SODS LIKE GRASSES FROM FORTY TO EIGHTY FEET HIGH
175-127696-0016 BENDING ALL TOGETHER TO THE BREEZE AND WHIRLING IN EDDYING GUSTS MORE LIVELY THAN ANY OTHER TREE IN THE WOODS I FREQUENTLY FOUND SPECIMENS FIFTY FEET HIGH LESS THAN FIVE INCHES IN DIAMETER BEING SO SLENDER AND AT THE SAME TIME CLAD WITH LEAFY BOUGHS
175-127696-0017 IT IS OFTEN BENT AND WEIGHED DOWN TO THE GROUND WHEN LADEN WITH SOFT SNOW THUS FORMING FINE ORNAMENTAL ARCHES MANY OF THEM TO LAST UNTIL THE MELTING OF THE SNOW IN THE SPRING THE MOUNTAIN PINE
175-127696-0018 THE MOUNTAIN PINE PINUS MONTICOLA IS THE NOBLEST TREE OF THE ALPINE ZONE HARDY AND LONG LIVED TOWERING GRANDLY ABOVE ITS COMPANIONS AND BECOMING STRONGER AND MORE IMPOSING
175-127696-0019 JUST WHERE OTHER SPECIES BEGIN TO CROUCH AND DISAPPEAR AT ITS BEST IT IS USUALLY ABOUT NINETY FEET HIGH AND FIVE OR SIX FEET IN DIAMETER THOUGH YOU MAY FIND SPECIMENS HERE AND THERE CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN THIS
175-127696-0020 IT IS AS MASSIVE AND SUGGESTIVE OF ENDURING STRENGTH AS AN OAK ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE TRUNK IS COMMONLY FREE OF LIMBS BUT CLOSE FRINGY TUFTS OF SPRAY OCCUR NEARLY ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE GROUND
175-127696-0021 ON TREES THAT OCCUPY EXPOSED SITUATIONS NEAR ITS UPPER LIMIT THE BARK IS DEEP REDDISH BROWN AND RATHER DEEPLY FURROWED THE MAIN FURROWS RUNNING NEARLY PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER AND CONNECTED ON THE OLD TREES BY CONSPICUOUS CROSS FURROWS
175-127696-0022 THE CONES ARE FROM FOUR TO EIGHT INCHES LONG SMOOTH SLENDER CYLINDRICAL AND SOMEWHAT CURVED THEY GROW IN CLUSTERS OF FROM THREE TO SIX OR SEVEN AND BECOME PENDULOUS AS THEY INCREASE IN WEIGHT
175-127696-0023 THIS SPECIES IS NEARLY RELATED TO THE SUGAR PINE AND THOUGH NOT HALF SO TALL IT SUGGESTS ITS NOBLE RELATIVE IN THE WAY THAT IT EXTENDS ITS LONG BRANCHES IN GENERAL HABIT IT IS FIRST MET ON THE UPPER MARGIN OF THE SILVER FIR ZONE
175-127696-0024 SINGLY IN WHAT APPEARS AS CHANCE SITUATIONS WITHOUT MAKING MUCH IMPRESSION ON THE GENERAL FOREST CONTINUING UP THROUGH THE FORESTS OF THE TWO LEAVED PINE IT BEGINS TO SHOW ITS DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC IN THE MOST MARKED WAY
175-127696-0025 AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND FEET EXTENDING ITS TOUGH RATHER SLENDER ARMS IN THE FROSTY AIR WELCOMING THE STORMS AND FEEDING ON THEM AND REACHING SOMETIMES TO THE GRAND OLD AGE
175-127696-0026 THE WESTERN JUNIPER THE JUNIPER OR RED CEDAR JUNIPERUS OCCIDENTALIS IS PREEMINENTLY A ROCK TREE
175-127696-0027 OCCUPYING THE BALDEST DOMES AND PAVEMENTS IN THE UPPER SILVER FIR AND ALPINE ZONES
175-127696-0028 IN SUCH SITUATIONS ROOTED IN NARROW CRACKS OR FISSURES WHERE THERE IS SCARCELY A HANDFUL OF SOIL IT IS FREQUENTLY OVER EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER AND NOT MUCH MORE IN HEIGHT THE TOPS OF OLD TREES ARE ALMOST ALWAYS DEAD
175-127696-0029 DECORATED WITH A FEW LEAFY SPRAYS REMINDING ONE OF THE CRUMBLING TOWERS OF OLD CASTLES SCANTILY DRAPED WITH IVY ITS HOMES ON BARE BARREN DOME AND RIDGE TOP SEEM TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN FOR SAFETY AGAINST FIRE
175-127696-0030 WITH SCARCE A TRACE OF THE ROCKY ANGULARITY AND BROKEN LIMBS SO CHARACTERISTIC A FEATURE THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF ITS RANGE IT NEVER MAKES ANYTHING LIKE A FOREST SELDOM EVEN A GROVE USUALLY IT STANDS OUT SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT
175-127696-0031 CLINGING BY SLIGHT JOINTS TO THE ROCKS LIVING CHIEFLY ON SNOW AND THIN AIR AND MAINTAINING SOUND HEALTH ON THIS DIET FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS OR MORE EVERY FEATURE OR EVERY GESTURE IT MAKES EXPRESSES STEADFAST DOGGED ENDURANCE
175-127696-0032 THE BARK IS OF A BRIGHT CINNAMON COLOR AND IS HANDSOMELY BRAIDED AND RETICULATED ON THRIFTY TREES FLAKING OFF IN THIN SHINING RIBBONS THAT ARE SOMETIMES USED BY THE INDIANS FOR TENT MATTING
175-127696-0033 ITS FINE COLOR AND PICTURESQUENESS ARE APPRECIATED BY ARTISTS BUT TO ME THE JUNIPER SEEMS A SINGULARLY STRANGE AND TACITURN TREE I HAVE SPENT MANY A DAY AND NIGHT IN ITS COMPANY
175-127696-0034 IT SEEMS TO BE A SURVIVOR OF SOME ANCIENT RACE WHOLLY UNACQUAINTED WITH ITS NEIGHBORS ITS BROAD STUMPINESS OF COURSE MAKES WIND WAVING OR EVEN SHAKING OUT OF THE QUESTION BUT IT IS NOT THIS ROCKY RIGIDITY THAT CONSTITUTES ITS SILENCE
175-127696-0035 IN CALM SUN DAYS THE SUGAR PINE PREACHES LIKE AN ENTHUSIASTIC APOSTLE WITHOUT MOVING A LEAF ON LEVEL ROCKS THE JUNIPER DIES STANDING AND WASTES INSENSIBLY OUT OF EXISTENCE LIKE GRANITE THE WIND EXERTING ABOUT AS LITTLE CONTROL OVER IT
175-127696-0036 ALIVE OR DEAD AS IS DOES OVER A GLACIER BOULDER I HAVE SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME TRYING TO DETERMINE THE AGE OF THESE WONDERFUL TREES BUT AS ALL OF THE VERY OLD ONES ARE HONEY COMBED WITH DRY ROT I NEVER WAS ABLE TO GET A COMPLETE COUNT OF THE LARGEST
175-127696-0037 SOME ARE UNDOUBTEDLY MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND YEARS OLD FOR THOUGH ON DEEP MORAINE SOIL THEY GROW ABOUT AS FAST AS SOME OF THE PINES ON BARE PAVEMENTS AND SMOOTHLY GLACIATED OVERSWEPT RIDGES IN THE DOME REGION THEY GROW VERY SLOWLY
175-127696-0038 ONE ON THE STARR KING RIDGE ONLY TWO FEET ELEVEN INCHES IN DIAMETER
175-127696-0039 ANOTHER ON THE SAME RIDGE ONLY ONE FOOT SEVEN AND A HALF INCHES IN DIAMETER HAD REACHED THE AGE OF EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR YEARS THE FIRST FIFTEEN INCHES FROM THE BARK OF A MEDIUM SIZE TREE SIX FEET IN DIAMETER ON THE NORTH TENAYA PAVEMENT
175-127696-0040 HAD EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY NINE LAYERS OF WOOD BEYOND THIS THE COUNT WAS STOPPED BY DRY ROT AND SCARS THE LARGEST EXAMINED WAS THIRTY THREE FEET IN GIRTH OR NEARLY TEN FEET IN DIAMETER AND ALTHOUGH I HAVE FAILED TO GET ANYTHING LIKE A COMPLETE COUNT
