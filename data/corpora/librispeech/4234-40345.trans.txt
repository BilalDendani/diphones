4234-40345-0000 A BRIEF WIRE HAD CONTAINED THE WELCOME INVITATION AND UP TO THE TIME WHEN I HAD RECEIVED IT I HAD BEEN UNAWARE THAT HILTON WAS BACK IN ENGLAND MOREOVER BEYOND THE FACT THAT HIS HOUSE UPLANDS WAS NEAR H FOR WHICH I WAS INSTRUCTED TO CHANGE AT NEW STREET STATION BIRMINGHAM
4234-40345-0001 I HAD LITTLE IDEA OF ITS LOCATION BUT HE ADDED WIRE TRAIN AND WILL MEET AT H SO THAT I HAD NO UNEASINESS ON THAT SCORE I HAD CONTEMPLATED CATCHING THE TWO FORTY FIVE FROM EUSTON BUT BY THE TIME I HAD GOT MY WORK INTO SOMETHING LIKE ORDER
4234-40345-0002 I DECIDED THAT THE SIX FIFTY FIVE WOULD BE MORE SUITABLE AND DECIDED TO DINE ON THE TRAIN ALTOGETHER THERE WAS SOMETHING OF A RUSH AND HUSTLE ATTENDANT UPON GETTING AWAY AND WHEN AT LAST I FOUND MYSELF IN THE CAB BOUND FOR EUSTON I SAT BACK WITH A LONG DRAWN SIGH
4234-40345-0003 THE QUEST OF THE PROPHET'S SLIPPER WAS ENDED IN ALL PROBABILITY THAT BLOOD STAINED RELIC WAS ALREADY EASTWARD BOUND HASSAN OF ALEPPO ITS AWFUL GUARDIAN HAD TRIUMPHED AND HAD ESCAPED RETRIBUTION EARL DEXTER WAS DEAD
4234-40345-0004 I COULD NOT DOUBT THAT FOR THE MEMORY OF HIS BEAUTIFUL ACCOMPLICE CARNETA
4234-40345-0005 HAVE I NOT SAID THAT IT LIVED WITH ME EVEN AS THE PICTURE OF HER LOVELY PALE FACE PRESENTED ITSELF TO MY MIND THE CAB WAS HELD UP BY A TEMPORARY BLOCK IN THE TRAFFIC AND MY IMAGINATION PLAYED ME A STRANGE TRICK ANOTHER TAXI RAN CLOSE ALONGSIDE
4234-40345-0006 ALMOST AT THE MOMENT THAT THE PRESS OF VEHICLES MOVED ON AGAIN CERTAINLY I HAD NO MORE THAN A PASSING GLIMPSE OF THE OCCUPANTS
4234-40345-0007 FOR THAT OF EARL DEXTER THE TRAVELLERS HOWEVER WERE IMMEDIATELY LOST TO SIGHT IN THE REAR AND I WAS LEFT TO CONJECTURE WHETHER THIS HAD BEEN A NOT UNCOMMON FORM OF OPTICAL DELUSION OR WHETHER I HAD SEEN A GHOST
4234-40345-0008 AT ANY RATE AS I PASSED IN BETWEEN THE BIG PILLARS THE GATEWAY OF THE NORTH I SCRUTINIZED AND CLOSELY THE NUMEROUS HURRYING FIGURES ABOUT ME
4234-40345-0009 NONE OF THEM BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION COULD HAVE BEEN SET DOWN FOR THAT OF DEXTER THE STETSON MAN NO DOUBT I CONCLUDED I HAD BEEN TRICKED BY A CHANCE RESEMBLANCE
4234-40345-0010 HAVING DISPATCHED MY TELEGRAM I BOARDED THE SIX FIFTY FIVE I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE THE COMPARTMENT TO MYSELF AND SO DEEP IN REVERIE WAS I THAT THE TRAIN WAS ACTUALLY CLEAR OF THE PLATFORMS ERE I LEARNED THAT I HAD A COMPANION HE MUST HAVE JOINED ME AT THE MOMENT THAT THE TRAIN STARTED
4234-40345-0011 CERTAINLY I HAD NOT SEEN HIM ENTER BUT SUDDENLY LOOKING UP I MET THE EYES OF THIS MAN WHO OCCUPIED THE CORNER SEAT FACING ME THIS PERSON WAS OLIVE SKINNED CLEAN SHAVEN FINE FEATURED AND PERFECTLY GROOMED
4234-40345-0012 HIS AGE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANYTHING FROM TWENTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE BUT HIS HAIR AND BROWS WERE JET BLACK HIS EYES TOO WERE NEARER TO REAL BLACK THAN ANY HUMAN EYES I HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE EXCEPTING THE AWFUL EYES OF HASSAN OF ALEPPO HASSAN OF ALEPPO
4234-40345-0013 IT WAS TO THAT HOUR A MYSTERY HOW HIS GROUP OF TRAINED ASSASSINS THE HASHISHIN HAD QUITTED ENGLAND SINCE NONE OF THEM WERE KNOWN TO THE POLICE IT WAS NO INSOLUBLE MYSTERY I ADMIT BUT NEVERTHELESS IT WAS SINGULAR THAT THE CAREFUL WATCHING OF THE PORTS HAD YIELDED NO RESULT
4234-40345-0014 COULD IT BE THAT SOME OF THEM HAD NOT YET LEFT THE COUNTRY COULD IT BE I LOOKED INTENTLY INTO THE BLACK EYES THEY WERE CARESSING SMILING EYES AND LOOKED BOLDLY INTO MINE
4234-40345-0015 I PICKED UP A MAGAZINE PRETENDING TO READ BUT I SUPPORTED IT WITH MY LEFT HAND MY RIGHT WAS IN MY COAT POCKET AND IT RESTED UPON MY SMITH AND WESSON SO MUCH HAD THE SLIPPER OF MOHAMMED DONE FOR ME I WENT IN HOURLY DREAD OF MURDEROUS ATTACK
4234-40345-0016 THE NIGHT SWALLOWED HIM UP MY FEARS HAD BEEN JUSTIFIED THE MAN WAS ONE OF THE HASHISHIN A SPY OF HASSAN OF ALEPPO WHAT DID IT MEAN I CRANED FROM THE WINDOW SEARCHING THE PLATFORM RIGHT AND LEFT BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HIM
4234-40345-0017 WHEN THE TRAIN LEFT NORTHAMPTON I FOUND MYSELF ALONE AND I SHOULD ONLY WEARY YOU WERE I TO ATTEMPT TO RECOUNT THE TROUBLED CONJECTURES THAT BORE ME COMPANY TO BIRMINGHAM
4234-40345-0018 MORE THAN AN HOUR LATER I FOUND MYSELF STANDING AT TEN MINUTES TO ELEVEN UPON THE H PLATFORM WATCHING THE RED TAILLIGHT OF THE LOCAL DISAPPEAR INTO THE NIGHT
4234-40345-0019 THEN I REALIZED TO THE FULL THAT WITH FOUR MILES OF LONELY ENGLAND BEFORE ME THERE HUNG ABOVE MY HEAD A MYSTERIOUS THREAT A VAGUE MENACE
4234-40345-0020 THE SOLITARY OFFICIAL WHO BUT WAITED MY DEPARTURE TO LOCK UP THE STATION WAS THE LAST REPRESENTATIVE OF CIVILIZATION I COULD HOPE TO ENCOUNTER UNTIL THE GATES OF UPLANDS SHOULD BE OPENED TO ME WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH WHICH I WAS WARNED NOT TO INTERFERE
4234-40345-0021 MIGHT I NOT BY MY MERE PRESENCE IN THAT PLACE UNWITTINGLY BE INTERFERING NOW WITH THE STATION MASTER'S DIRECTIONS HUMMING LIKE A REFRAIN IN MY EARS I PASSED THROUGH THE SLEEPING VILLAGE AND OUT ON TO THE ROAD
4234-40345-0022 THE MOON WAS EXCEPTIONALLY BRIGHT AND UNOBSCURED ALTHOUGH A DENSE BANK OF CLOUD CREPT SLOWLY FROM THE WEST AND BEFORE ME THE PATH STRETCHED AS AN UNBROKEN THREAD OF SILVERY WHITE TWINING A SINUOUS WAY UP THE BRACKEN COVERED SLOPE TO WHERE SHARPLY DEFINED AGAINST THE MOONLIGHT SKY A COPPICE IN GROTESQUE SILHOUETTE MARKED THE SUMMIT
4234-40345-0023 THE MONTH HAD BEEN DRY AND TROPICALLY HOT AND MY FOOTSTEPS RANG CRISPLY UPON THE HARD GROUND THERE IS NOTHING MORE DECEPTIVE THAN A STRAIGHT ROAD UP A HILL AND HALF AN HOUR'S STEADY TRAMPING BUT SAW ME APPROACHING THE TREES
4234-40345-0024 I HAD SO FAR RESOLUTELY ENDEAVOURED TO KEEP MY MIND AWAY FROM THE IDEA OF SURVEILLANCE NOW AS I PAUSED TO LIGHT MY PIPE A NEVER FAILING FRIEND IN LONELINESS I PERCEIVED SOMETHING MOVE IN THE SHADOWS OF A NEIGHBOURING BUSH
4234-40345-0025 AND THE VERY INCONGRUITY OF ITS APPEARANCE SERVED TO REVIVE ALL MY APPREHENSIONS TAKING UP MY GRIP AS THOUGH I HAD NOTICED NOTHING OF AN ALARMING NATURE I PURSUED MY WAY UP THE SLOPE LEAVING A TRAIL OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN MY WAKE
4234-40345-0026 AND HAVING MY REVOLVER SECRETED UP MY RIGHT COAT SLEEVE SUCCESSFULLY RESISTING A TEMPTATION TO GLANCE BEHIND I ENTERED THE COVER OF THE COPPICE AND NOW INVISIBLE TO ANY ONE WHO MIGHT BE DOGGING ME STOOD AND LOOKED BACK UPON THE MOON BRIGHT ROAD
4234-40345-0027 THERE WAS NO LIVING THING IN SIGHT THE ROAD WAS EMPTY AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE THE COPPICE NOW REMAINED TO BE NEGOTIATED AND THEN IF THE STATION MASTER'S DIRECTIONS WERE NOT AT FAULT UPLANDS SHOULD BE VISIBLE BEYOND
4234-40345-0028 IT WAS A LONG WAY BEHIND SO FAR THAT HAD THE MOON BEEN LESS BRIGHT I COULD NEVER HAVE DISCERNED IT WHAT IT WAS I COULD NOT EVEN CONJECTURE BUT IT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A VAGUE GRAY PATCH MOVING NOT ALONG THE ROAD
4234-40345-0029 THE SIGHT WAS UNNERVING WHAT WERE THESE THINGS THAT APPROACHED SILENTLY STEALTHILY LIKE SNAKES IN THE GRASS A FEAR UNLIKE ANYTHING I HAD KNOWN BEFORE THE QUEST OF THE PROPHET'S SLIPPER HAD BROUGHT FANTASTIC HORROR INTO MY LIFE CAME UPON ME
4234-40345-0030 REVOLVER IN HAND I RAN RAN FOR MY LIFE TOWARD THE GAP IN THE TREES THAT MARKED THE COPPICE END AND AS I WENT SOMETHING HUMMED THROUGH THE DARKNESS BESIDE MY HEAD SOME PROJECTILE SOME VENOMOUS THING THAT MISSED ITS MARK BY A BARE INCH
4234-40345-0031 PAINFULLY CONVERSANT WITH THE UNCANNY WEAPONS EMPLOYED BY THE HASHISHIN I KNEW NOW BEYOND ANY POSSIBILITY OF DOUBT THAT DEATH WAS BEHIND ME A PATTERING LIKE NAKED FEET SOUNDED ON THE ROAD AND WITHOUT PAUSING IN MY HEADLONG CAREER I SENT A RANDOM SHOT INTO THE BLACKNESS
4234-40345-0032 THE CRACK OF THE SMITH AND WESSON REASSURED ME I PULLED UP SHORT TURNED AND LOOKED BACK TOWARD THE TREES NOTHING NO ONE
4234-40345-0033 A SHRILL WHISTLE MINOR EERIE IN RISING CADENCE SOUNDED ON THE DEAD SILENCE WITH PIERCING CLEARNESS SIX WHISTLES SEEMINGLY FROM ALL AROUND ME REPLIED SOME OBJECT CAME HUMMING THROUGH THE AIR AND I DUCKED WILDLY
4234-40345-0034 ON AND ON I RAN FLYING FROM AN UNKNOWN BUT AS A WARNING INSTINCT TOLD ME DEADLY PERIL RAN AS A MAN RUNS PURSUED BY DEVILS
4234-40345-0035 THE ROAD BENT SHARPLY TO THE LEFT THEN FORKED OVERHANGING TREES CONCEALED THE HOUSE AND THE LIGHT THOUGH HIGH UP UNDER THE EAVES WAS NO LONGER VISIBLE
4234-40345-0036 TRUSTING TO PROVIDENCE TO GUIDE ME I PLUNGED DOWN THE LANE THAT TURNED TO THE LEFT AND ALMOST EXHAUSTED SAW THE GATES BEFORE ME SAW THE SWEEP OF THE DRIVE AND THE MOONLIGHT GLEAMING ON THE WINDOWS NONE OF THE WINDOWS WERE ILLUMINATED
4234-40345-0037 THEY WERE LOCKED WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION I HURLED MY GRIP OVER THE TOP AND CLAMBERED UP THE BARS AS I GOT ASTRIDE FROM THE BLACKNESS OF THE LANE CAME THE OMINOUS HUM AND MY HAT WENT SPINNING AWAY ACROSS THE LAWN
4234-40345-0038 THE BLACK CLOUD VEILED THE MOON AND COMPLETE DARKNESS FELL
