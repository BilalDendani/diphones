6510-62558-0000 THE CONVALESCENCE OF THE YOUNG INVALID WAS REGULARLY PROGRESSING
6510-62558-0001 WERE HERE ALWAYS IN FEAR OF SOME SHOT FROM THE CONVICTS THERE ON THE CONTRARY IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT IMPREGNABLE AND INACCESSIBLE CLIFF THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR AND ANY ATTACK ON THEIR PERSONS WOULD CERTAINLY FAIL
6510-62558-0002 BUT WERE NOT UNEASY ON THAT ACCOUNT THE COURAGEOUS NEGRO WELL ENTRENCHED IN THE DEPTHS OF GRANITE HOUSE WOULD NOT ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE SURPRISED TOP HAD NOT BEEN SENT AGAIN TO HIM
6510-62558-0003 THEY WERE TO ACT AGAINST THE PIRATES WAS THOROUGHLY DISCUSSED ON THE TWENTY NINTH OF NOVEMBER BY CYRUS HARDING GIDEON SPILETT AND PENCROFT AT A MOMENT WHEN HERBERT WAS ASLEEP AND COULD NOT HEAR THEM MY FRIENDS SAID THE REPORTER
6510-62558-0004 BUT IS HE EQUAL TO FIVE ASKED THE ENGINEER I WILL JOIN PENCROFT SAID THE REPORTER AND BOTH OF US WELL ARMED AND ACCOMPANIED BY TOP MY DEAR SPILETT AND YOU PENCROFT ANSWERED HARDING
6510-62558-0005 IS THERE NOT OCCASION TO FEAR ON THE CONTRARY THAT THEY ARE SURE TO FIRE THE FIRST SHOT WELL CAPTAIN CRIED PENCROFT A BULLET DOES NOT ALWAYS REACH ITS MARK THAT WHICH STRUCK HERBERT DID NOT MISS PENCROFT
6510-62558-0006 REPLIED THE ENGINEER BESIDES OBSERVE THAT IF BOTH OF YOU LEFT THE CORRAL I SHOULD REMAIN HERE ALONE TO DEFEND IT DO YOU IMAGINE THAT THE CONVICTS WILL NOT SEE YOU LEAVE IT THAT THEY WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO ENTER THE FOREST
6510-62558-0007 AND THAT THEY WILL NOT ATTACK IT DURING YOUR ABSENCE KNOWING THAT THERE IS NO ONE HERE BUT A WOUNDED BOY AND A MAN YOU ARE RIGHT CAPTAIN REPLIED PENCROFT HIS CHEST SWELLING WITH SULLEN ANGER YOU ARE RIGHT
6510-62558-0008 AND IT IS BEST TO STAY HERE UNTIL WE CAN LEAVE IT TOGETHER CYRUS HARDING'S REASONING WAS UNANSWERABLE AND HIS COMPANIONS UNDERSTOOD IT WELL IF ONLY AYRTON WAS STILL ONE OF US
6510-62558-0009 SAID GIDEON SPILETT POOR FELLOW HIS RETURN TO SOCIAL LIFE WILL HAVE BEEN BUT OF SHORT DURATION IF HE IS DEAD ADDED PENCROFT IN A PECULIAR TONE DO YOU HOPE THEN PENCROFT
6510-62558-0010 THAT THE VILLAINS HAVE SPARED HIM ASKED GIDEON SPILETT YES IF THEY HAD ANY INTEREST IN DOING SO WHAT YOU SUPPOSE THAT AYRTON FINDING HIS OLD COMPANIONS FORGETTING ALL THAT HE OWES US WHO KNOWS ANSWERED THE SAILOR
6510-62558-0011 WHO DID NOT HAZARD THIS SHAMEFUL SUPPOSITION WITHOUT HESITATING PENCROFT SAID HARDING TAKING THE SAILOR'S ARM THAT IS A WICKED IDEA OF YOURS AND YOU WILL DISTRESS ME MUCH IF YOU PERSIST IN SPEAKING THUS
6510-62558-0012 AND I HAVE NEVER FELT SO EXCITED AS I DO NOW BE PATIENT PENCROFT REPLIED THE ENGINEER HOW LONG WILL IT BE MY DEAR SPILETT BEFORE YOU THINK HERBERT MAY BE CARRIED TO GRANITE HOUSE
6510-62558-0013 FOR ANY IMPRUDENCE MIGHT INVOLVE TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES BUT HIS CONVALESCENCE IS PROGRESSING AND IF HE CONTINUES TO GAIN STRENGTH IN EIGHT DAYS FROM NOW WELL WE SHALL SEE EIGHT DAYS
6510-62558-0014 THAT WOULD PUT OFF THE RETURN TO GRANITE HOUSE UNTIL THE FIRST DAYS OF DECEMBER
6510-62558-0015 BE FOLLOWED BY EXTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL LABORS INTERRUPTED ONLY BY THE PROJECTED EXPEDITION THROUGH THE ISLAND IT CAN THEREFORE BE WELL UNDERSTOOD HOW INJURIOUS THIS SECLUSION IN THE CORRAL MUST HAVE BEEN TO THE COLONISTS
6510-62558-0016 BUT IF THEY WERE COMPELLED TO BOW BEFORE NECESSITY THEY DID NOT DO SO WITHOUT IMPATIENCE ONCE OR TWICE THE REPORTER VENTURED OUT INTO THE ROAD AND MADE THE TOUR OF THE PALISADE TOP ACCOMPANIED HIM AND GIDEON SPILETT
6510-62558-0017 HIS GUN COCKED WAS READY FOR ANY EMERGENCY HE MET WITH NO MISADVENTURE AND FOUND NO SUSPICIOUS TRACES HIS DOG WOULD HAVE WARNED HIM OF ANY DANGER AND AS TOP DID NOT BARK
6510-62558-0018 GIDEON SPILETT WHO HAD VENTURED A QUARTER OF A MILE INTO THE WOODS TOWARDS THE SOUTH OF THE MOUNTAIN REMARKED THAT TOP SCENTED SOMETHING THE DOG HAD NO LONGER HIS UNCONCERNED MANNER HE WENT BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS FERRETING
6510-62558-0019 AND DREW OUT A RAG IT WAS A PIECE OF CLOTH STAINED AND TORN WHICH SPILETT IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT BACK TO THE CORRAL THERE IT WAS EXAMINED BY THE COLONISTS WHO FOUND THAT IT WAS A FRAGMENT OF AYRTON'S WAISTCOAT
6510-62558-0020 THE CONVICTS HAVE DRAGGED HIM AWAY IN SPITE OF HIMSELF DO YOU STILL DOUBT HIS HONESTY NO CAPTAIN ANSWERED THE SAILOR AND I REPENTED OF MY SUSPICION A LONG TIME AGO
6510-62558-0021 THEREFORE PERHAPS HE IS STILL LIVING PERHAPS INDEED REPLIED THE ENGINEER WHO REMAINED THOUGHTFUL THIS WAS A HOPE TO WHICH AYRTON'S COMPANIONS COULD STILL HOLD INDEED THEY HAD BEFORE BELIEVED THAT
6510-62558-0022 SURPRISED IN THE CORRAL AYRTON HAD FALLEN BY A BULLET AS HERBERT HAD FALLEN BUT IF THE CONVICTS HAD NOT KILLED HIM AT FIRST IF THEY HAD BROUGHT HIM LIVING TO ANOTHER PART OF THE ISLAND MIGHT IT NOT BE ADMITTED
6510-62558-0023 BUT THAT THEY HAD CONCEIVED THE IMPOSSIBLE HOPE OF BRINGING BACK AYRTON TO THEMSELVES HE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO THEM IF THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO MAKE HIM TURN TRAITOR THIS INCIDENT WAS THEREFORE
6510-62558-0024 FAVORABLY INTERPRETED AT THE CORRAL AND IT NO LONGER APPEARED IMPOSSIBLE THAT THEY SHOULD FIND AYRTON AGAIN ON HIS SIDE IF HE WAS ONLY A PRISONER AYRTON WOULD NO DOUBT DO ALL HE COULD TO ESCAPE
6510-62558-0025 FROM THE HANDS OF THE VILLAINS AND THIS WOULD BE A POWERFUL AID TO THE SETTLERS AT ANY RATE OBSERVED GIDEON SPILETT IF HAPPILY AYRTON DID MANAGE TO ESCAPE HE WOULD GO DIRECTLY TO GRANITE HOUSE
6510-62558-0026 FOR HE COULD NOT KNOW OF THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF WHICH HERBERT HAS BEEN A VICTIM AND CONSEQUENTLY WOULD NEVER THINK OF OUR BEING IMPRISONED IN THE CORRAL OH I WISH THAT HE WAS THERE AT GRANITE HOUSE CRIED PENCROFT
6510-62558-0027 ONE IDEA OCCUPIED HIS MIND TO LEAVE THE CORRAL AND WHEN HE BELIEVED HE COULD BEAR REMOVAL TO GRANITE HOUSE HE WAS SURE HIS STRENGTH WOULD RETURN MORE QUICKLY IN HIS ROOM WITH THE AIR AND SIGHT OF THE SEA
6510-62558-0028 SEVERAL TIMES HE PRESSED GIDEON SPILETT BUT THE LATTER FEARING WITH GOOD REASON THAT HERBERT'S WOUNDS HALF HEALED MIGHT REOPEN ON THE WAY DID NOT GIVE THE ORDER TO START HOWEVER
6510-62558-0029 HARDING PENCROFT AND SPILETT SEIZED THEIR GUNS AND RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE TOP AT THE FOOT OF THE PALISADE WAS JUMPING BARKING BUT IT WAS WITH PLEASURE NOT ANGER SOME ONE IS COMING YES IT IS NOT AN ENEMY
6510-62558-0030 OR AYRTON THESE WORDS HAD HARDLY BEEN EXCHANGED BETWEEN THE ENGINEER AND HIS TWO COMPANIONS WHEN A BODY LEAPED OVER THE PALISADE AND FELL ON THE GROUND INSIDE THE CORRAL
6510-62558-0031 THEN REPLIED THE ENGINEER HE MUST HAVE SOME NOTE ON HIM PENCROFT RUSHED UP TO THE ORANG
6510-62558-0032 THE DESPAIR OF HARDING AND HIS COMPANIONS MAY BE IMAGINED WHEN THEY READ THESE WORDS FRIDAY SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING PLATEAU INVADED BY CONVICTS
6510-62558-0033 THEY GAZED AT EACH OTHER WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD THEN THEY RE ENTERED THE HOUSE WHAT WERE THEY TO DO THE CONVICTS ON PROSPECT HEIGHTS THAT WAS DISASTER DEVASTATION
6510-62558-0034 RUIN HERBERT ON SEEING THE ENGINEER THE REPORTER AND PENCROFT RE ENTER GUESSED THAT THEIR SITUATION WAS AGGRAVATED AND WHEN HE SAW JUP HE NO LONGER DOUBTED THAT SOME MISFORTUNE MENACED GRANITE HOUSE
6510-62558-0035 THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN TWO GUNS LESS FOR DEFENSE IF AN ATTACK WAS MADE ON THE ROAD WOULD THEY NOT ON THE CONTRARY BY EMPLOYING THE CART LEAVE EVERY ARM FREE
6510-62558-0036 THE ENGINEER AND PENCROFT EACH ARMED WITH A DOUBLE BARRELED GUN AND GIDEON SPILETT CARRYING HIS RIFLE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT START ARE YOU COMFORTABLE HERBERT ASKED THE ENGINEER AH CAPTAIN
6510-62558-0037 DON'T BE UNEASY I SHALL NOT DIE ON THE ROAD WHILE SPEAKING THUS IT COULD BE SEEN THAT THE POOR BOY HAD CALLED UP ALL HIS ENERGY AND BY THE ENERGY OF A POWERFUL WILL HAD COLLECTED HIS FAILING STRENGTH
6510-62558-0038 THE ENGINEER FELT HIS HEART SINK PAINFULLY HE STILL HESITATED TO GIVE THE SIGNAL FOR DEPARTURE BUT THAT WOULD HAVE DRIVEN HERBERT TO DESPAIR KILLED HIM PERHAPS FORWARD
6510-62558-0039 WHO KNEW WHEN TO BE SILENT RAN IN ADVANCE THE CART CAME OUT THE GATE WAS RECLOSED AND THE ONAGER LED BY PENCROFT ADVANCED AT A SLOW PACE CERTAINLY
6510-62558-0040 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFER TO HAVE TAKEN A DIFFERENT ROAD THAN THAT WHICH LED STRAIGHT FROM THE CORRAL TO GRANITE HOUSE BUT THE CART WOULD HAVE MET WITH GREAT DIFFICULTIES IN MOVING UNDER THE TREES IT WAS NECESSARY THEREFORE TO FOLLOW THIS WAY
6510-62558-0041 ALTHOUGH IT WAS WELL KNOWN TO THE CONVICTS CYRUS HARDING AND GIDEON SPILETT WALKED ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE CART READY TO ANSWER TO ANY ATTACK HOWEVER
6510-62558-0042 IT WAS NOT PROBABLE THAT THE CONVICTS WOULD HAVE YET LEFT THE PLATEAU OF PROSPECT HEIGHTS NEB'S NOTE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN WRITTEN AND SENT AS SOON AS THE CONVICTS HAD SHOWN THEMSELVES THERE NOW THIS NOTE WAS DATED SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND THE ACTIVE ORANG
6510-62558-0043 ACCUSTOMED TO COME FREQUENTLY TO THE CORRAL HAD TAKEN SCARCELY THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR TO CROSS THE FIVE MILES WHICH SEPARATED IT FROM GRANITE HOUSE THEY WOULD THEREFORE BE SAFE AT THAT TIME AND IF THERE WAS ANY OCCASION FOR FIRING
6510-62558-0044 IT WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE UNTIL THEY WERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF GRANITE HOUSE HOWEVER THE COLONISTS KEPT A STRICT WATCH
6510-62558-0045 THE LATTER ARMED WITH HIS CLUB SOMETIMES IN FRONT SOMETIMES BEATING THE WOOD AT THE SIDES OF THE ROAD SIGNALIZED NO DANGER THE CART ADVANCED SLOWLY UNDER PENCROFT'S GUIDANCE IT HAD LEFT THE CORRAL AT HALF PAST SEVEN
6510-62558-0046 AN HOUR AFTER FOUR OUT OF THE FIVE MILES HAD BEEN CLEARED WITHOUT ANY INCIDENT HAVING OCCURRED THE ROAD WAS AS DESERTED AS ALL THAT PART OF THE JACAMAR WOOD WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE MERCY AND THE LAKE
6510-62558-0047 CYRUS HARDING EXPECTED TO FIND IT IN ITS PLACE SUPPOSING THAT THE CONVICTS WOULD HAVE CROSSED IT AND THAT AFTER HAVING PASSED ONE OF THE STREAMS WHICH ENCLOSED THE PLATEAU THEY WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE PRECAUTION TO LOWER IT AGAIN
6510-62558-0048 SO AS TO KEEP OPEN A RETREAT AT LENGTH AN OPENING IN THE TREES ALLOWED THE SEA HORIZON TO BE SEEN BUT THE CART CONTINUED ITS PROGRESS FOR NOT ONE OF ITS DEFENDERS THOUGHT OF ABANDONING IT
6510-62558-0049 AT THAT MOMENT PENCROFT STOPPED THE ONAGER AND IN A HOARSE VOICE OH THE VILLAINS HE EXCLAIMED AND HE POINTED TO A THICK SMOKE RISING FROM THE MILL THE SHEDS AND THE BUILDINGS AT THE POULTRY YARD
6510-62558-0050 HIS COMPANIONS UTTERED A SHOUT HE HEARD AND RAN TO MEET THEM THE CONVICTS HAD LEFT THE PLATEAU NEARLY HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HAVING DEVASTATED IT AND MISTER HERBERT
6510-62558-0051 GIDEON SPILETT RETURNED TO THE CART
