667-158816-0000 LADY EUSTACE DID NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE DURING THE SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AND ENGAGED HERSELF EXCLUSIVELY WITH PREPARING FOR HER JOURNEY SHE HAD NO FURTHER INTERVIEW WITH MISSUS CARBUNCLE BUT THERE WERE MESSAGES BETWEEN THEM AND EVEN NOTES WERE WRITTEN THEY RESULTED IN NOTHING
667-158816-0001 LIZZIE MIGHT HAVE SAVED HERSELF THE TROUBLE HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT IT WAS A PLEASURE TO HER TO INSULT HER LATE FRIEND EVEN THOUGH IN DOING SO NEW INSULTS WERE HEAPED UPON HER OWN HEAD AS FOR THE TRUMPERY SPOONS THEY SO SAID MISSUS CARBUNCLE
667-158816-0002 WERE THE PROPERTY OF MISS ROANOKE HAVING BEEN MADE OVER TO HER UNCONDITIONALLY LONG BEFORE THE WEDDING AS A PART OF A SEPARATE PECUNIARY TRANSACTION MISSUS CARBUNCLE HAD NO POWER OF DISPOSING OF MISS ROANOKE'S PROPERTY
667-158816-0003 AS TO THE MONEY WHICH LADY EUSTACE CLAIMED MISSUS CARBUNCLE ASSERTED THAT WHEN THE FINAL ACCOUNTS SHOULD BE MADE UP BETWEEN THEM IT WOULD BE FOUND THAT THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE BALANCE DUE TO MISSUS CARBUNCLE BUT EVEN WERE THERE ANYTHING DUE TO LADY EUSTACE
667-158816-0004 MISSUS CARBUNCLE WOULD DECLINE TO PAY IT AS SHE WAS INFORMED THAT ALL MONEYS POSSESSED BY LADY EUSTACE WERE NOW CONFISCATED TO THE CROWN BY REASON OF THE PERJURIES THE WORD WAS DOUBLY SCORED IN MISSUS CARBUNCLE'S NOTE WHICH LADY EUSTACE HAD COMMITTED
667-158816-0005 THIS OF COURSE WAS UNPLEASANT BUT MISSUS CARBUNCLE DID NOT HAVE THE HONOURS OF THE BATTLE ALL TO HERSELF LIZZIE ALSO SAID SOME UNPLEASANT THINGS WHICH PERHAPS WERE THE MORE UNPLEASANT BECAUSE THEY WERE TRUE
667-158816-0006 MISSUS CARBUNCLE HAD COME PRETTY NEARLY TO THE END OF HER CAREER WHEREAS LIZZIE'S INCOME IN SPITE OF HER PERJURIES WAS COMPARATIVELY UNTOUCHED THE UNDOUBTED MISTRESS OF PORTRAY CASTLE
667-158816-0007 COULD STILL DESPISE AND LOOK DOWN UPON MISSUS CARBUNCLE
667-158816-0008 LIZZIE IN SENDING TO HIM HAD SOME HALF FORMED IDEA OF A ROMANTIC FAREWELL THE MAN SHE THOUGHT HAD BEHAVED VERY BADLY TO HER HAD ACCEPTED VERY MUCH FROM HER HANDS AND HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HER ANYTHING IN RETURN
667-158816-0009 HAD BECOME THE FIRST DEPOSITORY OF HER GREAT SECRET AND HAD PLACED NO MUTUAL CONFIDENCE IN HER HE HAD BEEN HARSH TO HER AND UNJUST AND THEN TOO HE HAD DECLINED TO BE IN LOVE WITH HER SHE WAS FULL OF SPITE AGAINST LORD GEORGE AND WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO INJURE HIM
667-158816-0010 BUT NEVERTHELESS THERE WOULD BE SOME EXCITEMENT IN A FAREWELL IN WHICH SOME MOCK AFFECTION MIGHT BE DISPLAYED AND SHE WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF ABUSING MISSUS CARBUNCLE SO YOU ARE OFF TO MORROW SAID LORD GEORGE TAKING HIS PLACE ON THE RUG BEFORE HER FIRE
667-158816-0011 AND LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH HIS HEAD A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE LIZZIE'S ANGER AGAINST THE MAN CHIEFLY AROSE FROM A FEELING THAT HE TREATED HER WITH ALL A CORSAIR'S FREEDOM WITHOUT ANY OF A CORSAIR'S TENDERNESS
667-158816-0012 HAD THERE BEEN ANY DEVOTION BUT LORD GEORGE WAS BOTH IMPUDENT AND INDIFFERENT YES SHE SAID THANK GOODNESS I SHALL GET OUT OF THIS FRIGHTFUL PLACE TO MORROW AND SOON HAVE ONCE MORE A ROOF OF MY OWN OVER MY HEAD
667-158816-0013 WE HAVE ALL HAD AN EXPERIENCE SAID LORD GEORGE STILL LOOKING AT HER WITH THAT HALF COMIC TURN OF HIS FACE
667-158816-0014 NO WOMAN EVER INTENDED TO SHOW A MORE DISINTERESTED FRIENDSHIP THAN I HAVE DONE AND WHAT HAS BEEN MY RETURN YOU MEAN TO ME DISINTERESTED FRIENDSHIP TO ME AND LORD GEORGE TAPPED HIS BREAST LIGHTLY WITH HIS FINGERS
667-158816-0015 COVERING HER FACE WITH HER HANDS THEY DON'T DO MUCH GOOD DO THEY IT'S BETTER TO TAKE PEOPLE AS YOU FIND EM AND THEN MAKE THE BEST OF EM THEY'RE A QUEER LOT AIN'T THEY THE SORT OF PEOPLE ONE MEETS ABOUT IN THE WORLD

667-158816-0019 I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE A VERY DANGEROUS COMPANION PRAY DON'T TALK ABOUT THE HORRID NECKLACE THEN CAME THE ROBBERY AND YOU SEEMED TO LOSE YOUR DIAMONDS WITHOUT BEING AT ALL UNHAPPY ABOUT THEM OF COURSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT NOW
667-158816-0020 ON HEARING THIS LIZZIE SMILED BUT DID NOT SAY A WORD THEN I PERCEIVED THAT I
