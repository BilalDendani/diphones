1913-143521-0000 I FEEL IT INCUMBENT ON ME TO EXPLAIN WHAT MY EXACT CONNECTION WITH IT IS AND SO I MAY AS WELL SAY AT ONCE THAT I AM NOT THE NARRATOR BUT ONLY THE EDITOR OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY HISTORY AND THEN GO ON TO TELL HOW IT FOUND ITS WAY INTO MY HANDS
1913-143521-0001 SOME YEARS AGO I THE EDITOR WAS STOPPING WITH A FRIEND VIR DOCTISSIMUS ET AMICUS NEUS AT A CERTAIN UNIVERSITY WHICH FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS HISTORY WE WILL CALL CAMBRIDGE
1913-143521-0002 ONE OF THESE GENTLEMEN WAS I THINK WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE HANDSOMEST YOUNG FELLOW I HAVE EVER SEEN HE WAS VERY TALL VERY BROAD AND HAD A LOOK OF POWER AND A GRACE OF BEARING THAT SEEMED AS NATIVE TO HIM AS IT IS TO A WILD STAG
1913-143521-0003 IN ADDITION HIS FACE WAS ALMOST WITHOUT FLAW A GOOD FACE AS WELL AS A BEAUTIFUL ONE AND WHEN HE LIFTED HIS HAT WHICH HE DID JUST THEN TO A PASSING LADY I SAW THAT HIS HEAD WAS COVERED WITH LITTLE GOLDEN CURLS GROWING CLOSE TO THE SCALP
1913-143521-0004 GOOD GRACIOUS I SAID TO MY FRIEND WITH WHOM I WAS WALKING
1913-143521-0005 THEY CALL HIM THE GREEK GOD BUT LOOK AT THE OTHER ONE HE'S VINCEY'S THAT'S THE GOD'S NAME GUARDIAN AND SUPPOSED TO BE FULL OF EVERY KIND OF INFORMATION
1913-143521-0006 I LOOKED AND FOUND THE OLDER MAN QUITE AS INTERESTING IN HIS WAY AS THE GLORIFIED SPECIMEN OF HUMANITY AT HIS SIDE HE APPEARED TO BE ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE AND WAS I THINK AS UGLY AS HIS COMPANION WAS HANDSOME
1913-143521-0007 TO BEGIN WITH HE WAS SHORTISH RATHER BOW LEGGED VERY DEEP CHESTED AND WITH UNUSUALLY LONG ARMS HE HAD DARK HAIR AND SMALL EYES AND THE HAIR GREW RIGHT DOWN ON HIS FOREHEAD
1913-143521-0008 AND HIS WHISKERS GREW RIGHT UP TO HIS HAIR SO THAT THERE WAS UNCOMMONLY LITTLE OF HIS COUNTENANCE TO BE SEEN ALTOGETHER HE REMINDED ME FORCIBLY OF A GORILLA AND YET THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY PLEASING AND GENIAL ABOUT THE MAN'S EYE I REMEMBER SAYING THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HIM
1913-143521-0009 ALL RIGHT ANSWERED MY FRIEND NOTHING EASIER I KNOW VINCEY I'LL INTRODUCE YOU AND HE DID AND FOR SOME MINUTES WE STOOD CHATTING ABOUT THE ZULU PEOPLE I THINK FOR I HAD JUST RETURNED FROM THE CAPE AT THE TIME PRESENTLY HOWEVER
1913-143521-0010 A STOUTISH LADY WHOSE NAME I DO NOT REMEMBER CAME ALONG THE PAVEMENT ACCOMPANIED BY A PRETTY FAIR HAIRED GIRL AND THESE TWO MISTER VINCEY WHO CLEARLY KNEW THEM WELL AT ONCE JOINED WALKING OFF IN THEIR COMPANY
1913-143521-0011 WHOSE NAME I DISCOVERED WAS HOLLY WHEN HE SAW THE LADIES ADVANCING HE SUDDENLY STOPPED SHORT IN HIS TALK CAST A REPROACHFUL LOOK AT HIS COMPANION AND WITH AN ABRUPT NOD TO MYSELF TURNED AND MARCHED OFF ALONE ACROSS THE STREET
1913-143521-0012 I HEARD AFTERWARDS THAT HE WAS POPULARLY SUPPOSED TO BE AS MUCH AFRAID OF A WOMAN AS MOST PEOPLE ARE OF A MAD DOG WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR HIS PRECIPITATE RETREAT I CANNOT SAY HOWEVER THAT YOUNG VINCEY SHOWED MUCH AVERSION TO FEMININE SOCIETY ON THIS OCCASION
1913-143521-0013 SINCE IT WAS EXCEEDINGLY PROBABLE THAT THE ACQUAINTANCE WOULD END IN A TRANSFER OF HER AFFECTIONS HE WAS ALTOGETHER TOO GOOD LOOKING AND WHAT IS MORE HE HAD NONE OF THAT CONSCIOUSNESS AND CONCEIT ABOUT HIM WHICH USUALLY AFFLICTS HANDSOME MEN
1913-143521-0014 AND MAKES THEM DESERVEDLY DISLIKED BY THEIR FELLOWS THAT SAME EVENING
1913-143521-0015 THIS WAS THE LAST I SAW OR HEARD OF CHARON AND THE GREEK GOD FOR MANY A LONG DAY
1913-143521-0016 BUT A MONTH AGO I RECEIVED A LETTER AND TWO PACKETS ONE OF MANUSCRIPT
1913-143521-0017 BY HORACE HOLLY A NAME THAT AT THE MOMENT WAS NOT FAMILIAR TO ME IT RAN AS FOLLOWS
1913-143521-0018 MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN MY DEAR SIR YOU WILL BE SURPRISED CONSIDERING THE VERY SLIGHT NATURE OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE TO GET A LETTER FROM ME
1913-143521-0019 TO BE BRIEF AND COME TO MY BUSINESS I HAVE RECENTLY READ WITH MUCH INTEREST A BOOK OF YOURS DESCRIBING A CENTRAL AFRICAN ADVENTURE
1913-143521-0020 HOWEVER THIS MAY BE IT HAS GIVEN ME AN IDEA
1913-143521-0021 WHICH TOGETHER WITH THE SCARAB THE ROYAL SON OF THE SUN
1913-143521-0022 THAT MY WARD
1913-143521-0023 LEO VINCEY AND MYSELF HAVE RECENTLY PASSED THROUGH A REAL AFRICAN ADVENTURE OF A NATURE SO MUCH MORE MARVELLOUS THAN THE ONE WHICH YOU DESCRIBE THAT TO TELL THE TRUTH I AM ALMOST ASHAMED TO SUBMIT IT TO YOU LEST YOU SHOULD DISBELIEVE MY TALE
1913-143521-0024 YOU WILL SEE IT STATED IN THIS MANUSCRIPT THAT I OR RATHER WE HAD MADE UP OUR MINDS NOT TO MAKE THIS HISTORY PUBLIC DURING OUR JOINT LIVES NOR SHOULD WE ALTER OUR DETERMINATION WERE IT NOT FOR A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HAS RECENTLY ARISEN
1913-143521-0025 GOING AWAY AGAIN THIS TIME TO CENTRAL ASIA WHERE IF ANYWHERE UPON THIS EARTH WISDOM IS TO BE FOUND AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR SOJOURN THERE WILL BE A LONG ONE POSSIBLY WE SHALL NOT RETURN
1913-143521-0026 UNDER THESE ALTERED CONDITIONS IT HAS BECOME A QUESTION WHETHER WE ARE JUSTIFIED IN WITHHOLDING FROM THE WORLD AN ACCOUNT OF A PHENOMENON WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE OF UNPARALLELED INTEREST MERELY BECAUSE OUR PRIVATE LIFE IS INVOLVED
1913-143521-0027 OR BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID OF RIDICULE AND DOUBT BEING CAST UPON OUR STATEMENTS I HOLD ONE VIEW ABOUT THIS MATTER AND LEO HOLDS ANOTHER AND FINALLY AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION WE HAVE COME TO A COMPROMISE NAMELY TO SEND THE HISTORY TO YOU
1913-143521-0028 GIVING YOU FULL LEAVE TO PUBLISH IT IF YOU THINK FIT THE ONLY STIPULATION BEING THAT YOU SHALL DISGUISE OUR REAL NAMES
1913-143521-0029 AND NOW WHAT AM I TO SAY FURTHER I REALLY DO NOT KNOW
1913-143521-0030 EXACTLY AS IT HAPPENED AS REGARDS SHE HERSELF I HAVE NOTHING TO ADD DAY BY DAY WE GAVE GREATER OCCASION TO REGRET THAT WE DID NOT BETTER AVAIL OURSELVES OF OUR OPPORTUNITIES TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION
1913-143521-0031 FROM THAT MARVELLOUS WOMAN WHO WAS SHE HOW DID SHE FIRST COME TO THE CAVES OF KOR
1913-143521-0032 WE NEVER ASCERTAINED AND NOW ALAS WE NEVER SHALL AT LEAST NOT YET THESE AND MANY OTHER QUESTIONS ARISE IN MY MIND BUT WHAT IS THE GOOD OF ASKING THEM NOW WILL YOU UNDERTAKE THE TASK
1913-143521-0033 WE GIVE YOU COMPLETE FREEDOM AND AS A REWARD YOU WILL WE BELIEVE HAVE THE CREDIT OF PRESENTING TO THE WORLD THE MOST WONDERFUL HISTORY AS DISTINGUISHED FROM ROMANCE THAT ITS RECORDS CAN SHOW READ THE MANUSCRIPT WHICH I HAVE COPIED OUT FAIRLY FOR YOUR BENEFIT
1913-143521-0034 P S OF COURSE IF ANY PROFIT RESULTS FROM THE SALE OF THE WRITING SHOULD YOU CARE TO UNDERTAKE ITS PUBLICATION YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE WITH IT BUT IF THERE IS A LOSS I WILL LEAVE INSTRUCTIONS WITH MY LAWYERS MESSRS GEOFFREY AND JORDAN TO MEET IT
1913-143521-0035 AS I THINK THE READER WILL BE ALSO AND AT ONCE MADE UP MY MIND TO PRESS ON WITH THE MATTER I WROTE TO THIS EFFECT TO MISTER HOLLY BUT A WEEK AFTERWARDS RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THAT GENTLEMAN'S LAWYERS RETURNING MY OWN
1913-143521-0036 WITH THE INFORMATION THAT THEIR CLIENT AND MISTER LEO VINCEY HAD ALREADY LEFT THIS COUNTRY FOR THIBET AND THEY DID NOT AT PRESENT KNOW THEIR ADDRESS WELL THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY OF THE HISTORY ITSELF THE READER MUST JUDGE I GIVE IT HIM
1913-143521-0037 AT FIRST I WAS INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THIS HISTORY OF A WOMAN ON WHOM CLOTHED IN THE MAJESTY OF HER ALMOST ENDLESS YEARS THE SHADOW OF ETERNITY ITSELF LAY LIKE THE DARK WING OF NIGHT WAS SOME GIGANTIC ALLEGORY OF WHICH I COULD NOT CATCH THE MEANING
1913-143521-0038 INFORMING THE SUBSTANCE OF A MORTAL WHO YET DREW HER STRENGTH FROM EARTH AND IN WHOSE HUMAN BOSOM PASSIONS YET ROSE AND FELL AND BEAT AS IN THE UNDYING WORLD AROUND HER THE WINDS AND THE TIDES RISE AND FALL AND BEAT UNCEASINGLY
1913-143521-0039 BUT AS I WENT ON I ABANDONED THAT IDEA ALSO TO ME THE STORY SEEMS TO BEAR THE STAMP OF TRUTH UPON ITS FACE ITS EXPLANATION I MUST LEAVE TO OTHERS AND WITH THIS SLIGHT PREFACE
1913-143521-0040 WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE NECESSARY I INTRODUCE THE WORLD TO AYESHA AND THE CAVES OF KOR THE EDITOR P S THERE IS ON CONSIDERATION
1913-143521-0041 HE WILL OBSERVE THAT SO FAR AS WE ARE MADE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM THERE APPEARS TO BE NOTHING IN THE CHARACTER OF LEO VINCEY WHICH IN THE OPINION OF MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKELY TO ATTRACT AN INTELLECT SO POWERFUL AS THAT OF AYESHA HE IS NOT EVEN
1913-143521-0042 AT ANY RATE TO MY VIEW PARTICULARLY INTERESTING INDEED ONE MIGHT IMAGINE THAT MISTER HOLLY WOULD UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE EASILY OUTSTRIPPED HIM IN THE FAVOUR OF SHE CAN IT BE THAT EXTREMES MEET
1913-143521-0043 AND THAT THE VERY EXCESS AND SPLENDOUR OF HER MIND LED HER BY MEANS OF SOME STRANGE PHYSICAL REACTION TO WORSHIP AT THE SHRINE OF MATTER
1913-143521-0044 OR IS THE TRUE EXPLANATION WHAT I BELIEVE IT TO BE NAMELY THAT AYESHA SEEING FURTHER THAN WE CAN SEE PERCEIVED THE GERM AND SMOULDERING SPARK OF GREATNESS WHICH LAY HID WITHIN HER LOVER'S SOUL
1913-143521-0045 AND WELL KNEW THAT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HER GIFT OF LIFE WATERED BY HER WISDOM AND SHONE UPON WITH THE SUNSHINE OF HER PRESENCE IT WOULD BLOOM LIKE A FLOWER AND FLASH OUT LIKE A STAR
1913-143521-0046 FILLING THE WORLD WITH LIGHT AND FRAGRANCE HERE ALSO I AM NOT ABLE TO ANSWER BUT MUST LEAVE THE READER TO FORM HIS OWN JUDGMENT ON THE FACTS BEFORE HIM
