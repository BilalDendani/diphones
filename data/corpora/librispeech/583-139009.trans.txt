583-139009-0000 CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR OF THE STEAMER NAN SHAN HAD A PHYSIOGNOMY THAT IN THE ORDER OF MATERIAL APPEARANCES WAS THE EXACT COUNTERPART OF HIS MIND IT PRESENTED NO MARKED CHARACTERISTICS OF FIRMNESS OR STUPIDITY
583-139009-0001 IT HAD NO PRONOUNCED CHARACTERISTICS WHATEVER IT WAS SIMPLY ORDINARY IRRESPONSIVE AND UNRUFFLED THE ONLY THING HIS ASPECT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAID TO SUGGEST AT TIMES WAS BASHFULNESS BECAUSE HE WOULD SIT IN BUSINESS OFFICES ASHORE
583-139009-0002 SUNBURNT AND SMILING FAINTLY WITH DOWNCAST EYES WHEN HE RAISED THEM THEY WERE PERCEIVED TO BE DIRECT IN THEIR GLANCE AND OF BLUE COLOUR HIS HAIR WAS FAIR AND EXTREMELY FINE CLASPING FROM TEMPLE TO TEMPLE THE BALD DOME OF HIS SKULL IN A CLAMP
583-139009-0003 AS OF FLUFFY SILK THE HAIR OF HIS FACE ON THE CONTRARY CARROTY AND FLAMING RESEMBLED A GROWTH OF COPPER WIRE CLIPPED SHORT TO THE LINE OF THE LIP WHILE NO MATTER HOW CLOSE HE SHAVED
583-139009-0004 FIERY METALLIC GLEAMS PASSED WHEN HE MOVED HIS HEAD OVER THE SURFACE OF HIS CHEEKS HE WAS RATHER BELOW THE MEDIUM HEIGHT
583-139009-0005 HE WORE A BROWN BOWLER HAT A COMPLETE SUIT OF A BROWNISH HUE AND CLUMSY BLACK BOOTS THESE HARBOUR TOGS GAVE TO HIS THICK FIGURE AN AIR OF STIFF AND UNCOUTH SMARTNESS A THIN SILVER WATCH CHAIN LOOPED HIS WAISTCOAT
583-139009-0006 AND HE NEVER LEFT HIS SHIP FOR THE SHORE WITHOUT CLUTCHING IN HIS POWERFUL HAIRY FIST AN ELEGANT UMBRELLA OF THE VERY BEST QUALITY BUT GENERALLY UNROLLED YOUNG JUKES THE CHIEF MATE ATTENDING HIS COMMANDER TO THE GANGWAY
583-139009-0007 WOULD SOMETIMES VENTURE TO SAY WITH THE GREATEST GENTLENESS ALLOW ME SIR AND POSSESSING HIMSELF OF THE UMBRELLA DEFERENTIALLY WOULD ELEVATE THE FERULE SHAKE THE FOLDS TWIRL A NEAT FURL IN A JIFFY
583-139009-0008 AND HAND IT BACK GOING THROUGH THE PERFORMANCE WITH A FACE OF SUCH PORTENTOUS GRAVITY THAT MISTER SOLOMON ROUT THE CHIEF ENGINEER SMOKING HIS MORNING CIGAR OVER THE SKYLIGHT WOULD TURN AWAY HIS HEAD IN ORDER TO HIDE A SMILE
583-139009-0009 OH AYE THE BLESSED GAMP THANK EE JUKES THANK EE WOULD MUTTER CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR HEARTILY WITHOUT LOOKING UP HAVING JUST ENOUGH IMAGINATION TO CARRY HIM THROUGH EACH SUCCESSIVE DAY AND NO MORE HE WAS TRANQUILLY SURE OF HIMSELF
583-139009-0010 AND FROM THE VERY SAME CAUSE HE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST CONCEITED IT IS YOUR IMAGINATIVE SUPERIOR WHO IS TOUCHY OVERBEARING AND DIFFICULT TO PLEASE BUT EVERY SHIP CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR COMMANDED WAS THE FLOATING ABODE OF HARMONY AND PEACE
583-139009-0011 WITH NOTHING EXCEPT A TWO POUND HAMMER AND A WHIP SAW IN THE WAY OF TOOLS YET THE UNINTERESTING LIVES OF MEN SO ENTIRELY GIVEN TO THE ACTUALITY OF THE BARE EXISTENCE HAVE THEIR MYSTERIOUS SIDE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
583-139009-0012 WHAT UNDER HEAVEN COULD HAVE INDUCED THAT PERFECTLY SATISFACTORY SON OF A PETTY GROCER IN BELFAST TO RUN AWAY TO SEA AND YET HE HAD DONE THAT VERY THING AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN IT WAS ENOUGH WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT OVER
583-139009-0013 POTENT AND INVISIBLE HAND THRUST INTO THE ANT HEAP OF THE EARTH LAYING HOLD OF SHOULDERS KNOCKING HEADS TOGETHER AND SETTING THE UNCONSCIOUS FACES OF THE MULTITUDE TOWARDS INCONCEIVABLE GOALS AND IN UNDREAMT OF DIRECTIONS
583-139009-0014 HIS FATHER NEVER REALLY FORGAVE HIM FOR THIS UNDUTIFUL STUPIDITY WE COULD HAVE GOT ON WITHOUT HIM HE USED TO SAY LATER ON BUT THERE'S THE BUSINESS AND HE AN ONLY SON TOO HIS MOTHER WEPT VERY MUCH AFTER HIS DISAPPEARANCE
583-139009-0015 AS IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM TO LEAVE WORD BEHIND HE WAS MOURNED OVER FOR DEAD TILL AFTER EIGHT MONTHS HIS FIRST LETTER ARRIVED FROM TALCAHUANO IT WAS SHORT AND CONTAINED THE STATEMENT WE HAD VERY FINE WEATHER ON OUR PASSAGE OUT
583-139009-0016 HIS CAPTAIN HAD ON THE VERY DAY OF WRITING ENTERED HIM REGULARLY ON THE SHIP'S ARTICLES AS ORDINARY SEAMAN BECAUSE I CAN DO THE WORK HE EXPLAINED THE MOTHER AGAIN WEPT COPIOUSLY WHILE THE REMARK TOM'S AN ASS EXPRESSED THE EMOTIONS OF THE FATHER
583-139009-0017 WHICH TO THE END OF HIS LIFE HE EXERCISED IN HIS INTERCOURSE WITH HIS SON A LITTLE PITYINGLY AS IF UPON A HALF WITTED PERSON
583-139009-0018 AND IN THE COURSE OF YEARS HE DESPATCHED OTHER LETTERS TO HIS PARENTS INFORMING THEM OF HIS SUCCESSIVE PROMOTIONS AND OF HIS MOVEMENTS UPON THE VAST EARTH IN THESE MISSIVES COULD BE FOUND SENTENCES LIKE THIS THE HEAT HERE IS VERY GREAT OR
583-139009-0019 ON CHRISTMAS DAY AT FOUR P M WE FELL IN WITH SOME ICEBERGS THE OLD PEOPLE ULTIMATELY BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH A GOOD MANY NAMES OF SHIPS AND WITH THE NAMES OF THE SKIPPERS WHO COMMANDED THEM WITH THE NAMES OF SCOTS AND ENGLISH SHIPOWNERS WITH THE NAMES OF SEAS OCEANS STRAITS PROMONTORIES
583-139009-0020 WITH OUTLANDISH NAMES OF LUMBER PORTS OF RICE PORTS OF COTTON PORTS
583-139009-0021 SHE WAS CALLED LUCY IT DID NOT SUGGEST ITSELF TO HIM TO MENTION WHETHER HE THOUGHT THE NAME PRETTY AND THEN THEY DIED
583-139009-0022 FOLLOWING SHORTLY UPON THE GREAT DAY WHEN HE GOT HIS FIRST COMMAND ALL THESE EVENTS HAD TAKEN PLACE MANY YEARS BEFORE THE MORNING WHEN IN THE CHART ROOM OF THE STEAMER NAN SHAN HE STOOD CONFRONTED BY THE FALL OF A BAROMETER HE HAD NO REASON TO DISTRUST
583-139009-0023 WAS OF A NATURE OMINOUSLY PROPHETIC BUT THE RED FACE OF THE MAN BETRAYED NO SORT OF INWARD DISTURBANCE OMENS WERE AS NOTHING TO HIM AND HE WAS UNABLE TO DISCOVER THE MESSAGE OF A PROPHECY TILL THE FULFILMENT HAD BROUGHT IT HOME TO HIS VERY DOOR
583-139009-0024 THAT'S A FALL AND NO MISTAKE HE THOUGHT THERE MUST BE SOME UNCOMMONLY DIRTY WEATHER KNOCKING ABOUT THE NAN SHAN WAS ON HER WAY FROM THE SOUTHWARD TO THE TREATY PORT OF FU CHAU
583-139009-0025 WITH SOME CARGO IN HER LOWER HOLDS AND TWO HUNDRED CHINESE COOLIES RETURNING TO THEIR VILLAGE HOMES IN THE PROVINCE OF FO KIEN AFTER A FEW YEARS OF WORK IN VARIOUS TROPICAL COLONIES THE MORNING WAS FINE THE OILY SEA HEAVED WITHOUT A SPARKLE
583-139009-0026 AND THERE WAS A QUEER WHITE MISTY PATCH IN THE SKY LIKE A HALO OF THE SUN THE FORE DECK PACKED WITH CHINAMEN WAS FULL OF SOMBRE CLOTHING YELLOW FACES AND PIGTAILS
583-139009-0027 AND THE HEAT WAS CLOSE THE COOLIES LOUNGED TALKED SMOKED OR STARED OVER THE RAIL SOME DRAWING WATER OVER THE SIDE SLUICED EACH OTHER A FEW SLEPT ON HATCHES WHILE SEVERAL SMALL PARTIES OF SIX SAT ON THEIR HEELS
583-139009-0028 SURROUNDING IRON TRAYS WITH PLATES OF RICE AND TINY TEACUPS AND EVERY SINGLE CELESTIAL OF THEM WAS CARRYING WITH HIM ALL HE HAD IN THE WORLD A WOODEN CHEST WITH A RINGING LOCK AND BRASS ON THE CORNERS CONTAINING THE SAVINGS OF HIS LABOURS
583-139009-0029 SOME CLOTHES OF CEREMONY STICKS OF INCENSE A LITTLE OPIUM MAYBE BITS OF NAMELESS RUBBISH OF CONVENTIONAL VALUE AND A SMALL HOARD OF SILVER DOLLARS TOILED FOR IN COAL LIGHTERS WON IN GAMBLING HOUSES OR IN PETTY TRADING
583-139009-0030 GRUBBED OUT OF EARTH SWEATED OUT IN MINES ON RAILWAY LINES IN DEADLY JUNGLE UNDER HEAVY BURDENS AMASSED PATIENTLY GUARDED WITH CARE CHERISHED FIERCELY
583-139009-0031 A CROSS SWELL HAD SET IN FROM THE DIRECTION OF FORMOSA CHANNEL ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK WITHOUT DISTURBING THESE PASSENGERS MUCH BECAUSE THE NAN SHAN WITH HER FLAT BOTTOM ROLLING CHOCKS ON BILGES AND GREAT BREADTH OF BEAM
583-139009-0032 HAD THE REPUTATION OF AN EXCEPTIONALLY STEADY SHIP IN A SEA WAY MISTER JUKES IN MOMENTS OF EXPANSION ON SHORE WOULD PROCLAIM LOUDLY THAT THE OLD GIRL WAS AS GOOD AS SHE WAS PRETTY
583-139009-0033 TO EXPRESS HIS FAVOURABLE OPINION SO LOUD OR IN TERMS SO FANCIFUL SHE WAS A GOOD SHIP UNDOUBTEDLY AND NOT OLD EITHER SHE HAD BEEN BUILT IN DUMBARTON LESS THAN THREE YEARS BEFORE TO THE ORDER OF A FIRM OF MERCHANTS IN SIAM
583-139009-0034 WHEN SHE LAY AFLOAT FINISHED IN EVERY DETAIL AND READY TO TAKE UP THE WORK OF HER LIFE THE BUILDERS CONTEMPLATED HER WITH PRIDE SIGG HAS ASKED US FOR A RELIABLE SKIPPER TO TAKE HER OUT REMARKED ONE OF THE PARTNERS AND THE OTHER AFTER REFLECTING FOR A WHILE SAID
583-139009-0035 NEXT MORNING MAC WHIRR STOOD BEFORE THEM UNPERTURBED HAVING TRAVELLED FROM LONDON BY THE MIDNIGHT EXPRESS AFTER A SUDDEN BUT UNDEMONSTRATIVE PARTING WITH HIS WIFE SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A SUPERIOR COUPLE WHO HAD SEEN BETTER DAYS
583-139009-0036 WE HAD BETTER BE GOING TOGETHER OVER THE SHIP CAPTAIN SAID THE SENIOR PARTNER AND THE THREE MEN STARTED TO VIEW THE PERFECTIONS OF THE NAN SHAN FROM STEM TO STERN AND FROM HER KEELSON TO THE TRUCKS OF HER TWO STUMPY POLE MASTS CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR HAD BEGUN BY TAKING OFF HIS COAT
583-139009-0037 WHICH HE HUNG ON THE END OF A STEAM WINDLESS EMBODYING ALL THE LATEST IMPROVEMENTS MY UNCLE WROTE OF YOU FAVOURABLY BY YESTERDAY'S MAIL TO OUR GOOD FRIENDS MESSRS SIGG YOU KNOW

583-139009-0039 TO WHOM THE VIEW OF A DISTANT EVENTUALITY COULD APPEAL NO MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF A WIDE LANDSCAPE TO A PURBLIND TOURIST AND HIS EYES HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT TO BE AT REST UPON THE LOCK OF THE CABIN DOOR HE WALKED UP TO IT
583-139009-0040 WHILE HE OBSERVED IN HIS LOW EARNEST VOICE
583-139009-0041 A BRAND NEW LOCK AND IT WON'T ACT AT ALL STUCK FAST SEE SEE AS SOON AS THEY FOUND THEMSELVES ALONE IN THEIR OFFICE ACROSS THE YARD YOU PRAISED THAT FELLOW UP TO SIGG
583-139009-0042 WITH FAINT CONTEMPT I ADMIT HE HAS NOTHING OF YOUR FANCY SKIPPER ABOUT HIM IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN SAID THE ELDER MAN CURTLY IS THE FOREMAN OF THE JOINERS ON THE NAN SHAN OUTSIDE COME IN BATES
583-139009-0043 HOW IS IT THAT YOU LET TAIT'S PEOPLE PUT US OFF WITH A DEFECTIVE LOCK ON THE CABIN DOOR THE CAPTAIN COULD SEE DIRECTLY HE SET EYE ON IT HAVE IT REPLACED AT ONCE THE LITTLE STRAWS BATES THE LITTLE STRAWS THE LOCK WAS REPLACED ACCORDINGLY
583-139009-0044 AND A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS THE NAN SHAN STEAMED OUT TO THE EAST WITHOUT MAC WHIRR HAVING OFFERED ANY FURTHER REMARK AS TO HER FITTINGS
583-139009-0045 THERE WERE MATTERS OF DUTY OF COURSE
583-139009-0046 BUT THE PAST BEING TO HIS MIND DONE WITH AND THE FUTURE NOT THERE YET THE MORE GENERAL ACTUALITIES OF THE DAY REQUIRED NO COMMENT BECAUSE FACTS CAN SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES WITH OVERWHELMING PRECISION
583-139009-0047 OLD MISTER SIGG LIKED A MAN OF FEW WORDS AND ONE THAT YOU COULD BE SURE WOULD NOT TRY TO IMPROVE UPON HIS INSTRUCTIONS
583-139009-0048 SHE HAD COME OUT ON A BRITISH REGISTER BUT AFTER SOME TIME MESSRS SIGG JUDGED IT EXPEDIENT TO TRANSFER HER TO THE SIAMESE FLAG AT THE NEWS OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSFER JUKES GREW RESTLESS AS IF UNDER A SENSE OF PERSONAL AFFRONT
583-139009-0049 HE WENT ABOUT GRUMBLING TO HIMSELF AND UTTERING SHORT SCORNFUL LAUGHS FANCY HAVING A RIDICULOUS NOAH'S ARK ELEPHANT IN THE ENSIGN OF ONE'S SHIP HE SAID ONCE AT THE ENGINE ROOM DOOR DASH ME IF I CAN STAND IT I'LL THROW UP THE BILLET DON'T IT MAKE YOU SICK MISTER ROUT
583-139009-0050 THE CHIEF ENGINEER ONLY CLEARED HIS THROAT WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO KNOWS THE VALUE OF A GOOD BILLET THE FIRST MORNING THE NEW FLAG FLOATED OVER THE STERN OF THE NAN SHAN JUKES STOOD LOOKING AT IT BITTERLY FROM THE BRIDGE
583-139009-0051 HE STRUGGLED WITH HIS FEELINGS FOR A WHILE AND THEN REMARKED QUEER FLAG FOR A MAN TO SAIL UNDER SIR WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THE FLAG INQUIRED CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR SEEMS ALL RIGHT TO ME AND HE WALKED ACROSS TO THE END OF THE BRIDGE TO HAVE A GOOD LOOK
583-139009-0052 WELL IT LOOKS QUEER TO ME BURST OUT JUKES GREATLY EXASPERATED AND FLUNG OFF THE BRIDGE CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR WAS AMAZED AT THESE MANNERS AFTER A WHILE HE STEPPED QUIETLY INTO THE CHART ROOM AND OPENED HIS INTERNATIONAL SIGNAL CODE BOOK
583-139009-0053 HE RAN HIS FINGER OVER THEM AND WHEN HE CAME TO SIAM HE CONTEMPLATED WITH GREAT ATTENTION THE RED FIELD AND THE WHITE ELEPHANT NOTHING COULD BE MORE SIMPLE BUT TO MAKE SURE HE BROUGHT THE BOOK OUT ON THE BRIDGE FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPARING THE COLOURED DRAWING WITH THE REAL THING AT THE FLAGSTAFF ASTERN
583-139009-0054 WHEN NEXT JUKES WHO WAS CARRYING ON THE DUTY THAT DAY WITH A SORT OF SUPPRESSED FIERCENESS HAPPENED ON THE BRIDGE HIS COMMANDER OBSERVED THERE'S NOTHING AMISS WITH THAT FLAG ISN'T THERE
583-139009-0055 NO I LOOKED UP THE BOOK LENGTH TWICE THE BREADTH AND THE ELEPHANT EXACTLY IN THE MIDDLE
583-139009-0056 WELL SIR BEGAN JUKES GETTING UP EXCITEDLY ALL I CAN SAY HE FUMBLED FOR THE END OF THE COIL OF LINE WITH TREMBLING HANDS THAT'S ALL RIGHT CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR SOOTHED HIM SITTING HEAVILY ON A LITTLE CANVAS FOLDING STOOL HE GREATLY AFFECTED
583-139009-0057 JUKES FLUNG THE NEW LEAD LINE OVER ON THE FORE DECK WITH A LOUD
583-139009-0058 AND TURNED WITH IMMENSE RESOLUTION TOWARDS HIS COMMANDER BUT CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR SPREAD HIS ELBOWS ON THE BRIDGE RAIL COMFORTABLY
583-139009-0059 HE WENT ON WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT ELEPHANT THERE I TAKE IT STANDS FOR SOMETHING IN THE NATURE OF THE UNION JACK IN THE FLAG
583-139009-0060 LOOKED TOWARDS THE BRIDGE THEN HE SIGHED AND WITH SUDDEN RESIGNATION IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE A DAM DISTRESSFUL SIGHT HE SAID MEEKLY LATER IN THE DAY HE ACCOSTED THE CHIEF ENGINEER WITH A CONFIDENTIAL
583-139009-0061 HERE LET ME TELL YOU THE OLD MAN'S LATEST MISTER SOLOMON ROUT FREQUENTLY ALLUDED TO AS LONG SOL OLD SOL OR FATHER ROUT FROM FINDING HIMSELF ALMOST INVARIABLY THE TALLEST MAN ON BOARD EVERY SHIP HE JOINED
583-139009-0062 HAD ACQUIRED THE HABIT OF A STOOPING LEISURELY CONDESCENSION
583-139009-0063 HIS FLAT CHEEKS WERE PALE HIS BONY WRISTS AND LONG SCHOLARLY HANDS WERE PALE TOO
583-139009-0064 HE SMILED FROM ON HIGH AT JUKES AND WENT ON SMOKING AND GLANCING ABOUT QUIETLY IN THE MANNER OF A KIND UNCLE LENDING AN EAR TO THE TALE OF AN EXCITED SCHOOLBOY THEN GREATLY AMUSED BUT IMPASSIVE HE ASKED
583-139009-0065 NO CRIED JUKES RAISING A WEARY DISCOURAGED VOICE ABOVE THE HARSH BUZZ OF THE NAN SHAN'S FRICTION WINCHES ALL OF THEM WERE HARD AT WORK SNATCHING SLINGS OF CARGO HIGH UP TO THE END OF LONG DERRICKS ONLY AS IT SEEMED TO LET THEM RIP DOWN RECKLESSLY BY THE RUN

583-139009-0067 HE SIMPLY KNOCKS ME OVER AT THAT MOMENT CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR BACK FROM THE SHORE CROSSED THE DECK UMBRELLA IN HAND ESCORTED BY A MOURNFUL SELF POSSESSED CHINAMAN WALKING BEHIND IN PAPER SOLED SILK SHOES AND WHO ALSO CARRIED AN UMBRELLA
583-139009-0068 SPEAKING JUST AUDIBLY AND GAZING AT HIS BOOTS AS HIS MANNER WAS
583-139009-0069 AND DESIRED MISTER ROUT TO HAVE STEAM UP TO MORROW AFTERNOON AT ONE O'CLOCK SHARP HE PUSHED BACK HIS HAT TO WIPE HIS FOREHEAD OBSERVING AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE HATED GOING ASHORE ANYHOW WHILE OVERTOPPING HIM MISTER ROUT WITHOUT DEIGNING A WORD SMOKED AUSTERELY
583-139009-0070 NURSING HIS RIGHT ELBOW IN THE PALM OF HIS LEFT HAND THEN JUKES WAS DIRECTED IN THE SAME SUBDUED VOICE TO KEEP THE FORWARD TWEEN DECK CLEAR OF CARGO TWO HUNDRED COOLIES WERE GOING TO BE PUT DOWN THERE THE BUN HIN COMPANY WERE SENDING THAT LOT HOME
583-139009-0071 TWENTY FIVE BAGS OF RICE WOULD BE COMING OFF IN A SAMPAN DIRECTLY FOR STORES ALL SEVEN YEARS' MEN THEY WERE SAID CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR WITH A CAMPHOR WOOD CHEST TO EVERY MAN
583-139009-0072 D'YE HEAR JUKES THIS CHINAMAN HERE WAS COMING WITH THE SHIP AS FAR AS FU CHAU A SORT OF INTERPRETER HE WOULD BE

583-139009-0076 THE CHINAMAN GAZING SAD AND SPEECHLESS INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE HATCHWAY SEEMED TO STAND AT THE HEAD OF A YAWNING GRAVE NO CATCHEE RAIN DOWN THERE SAVEE POINTED OUT JUKES SUPPOSE ALL'EE SAME FINE WEATHER

583-139009-0079 UNDER A COLLECTED DEMEANOUR TINGED BY A GENTLE AND REFINED MELANCHOLY GLANCED OUT OF HIS ALMOND EYES FROM JUKES TO THE HATCH AND BACK AGAIN VELLY GOOD HE MURMURED IN A DISCONSOLATE UNDERTONE AND HASTENED SMOOTHLY ALONG THE DECKS DODGING OBSTACLES IN HIS COURSE
583-139009-0080 HE DISAPPEARED DUCKING LOW UNDER A SLING OF TEN DIRTY GUNNY BAGS FULL OF SOME COSTLY MERCHANDISE AND EXHALING A REPULSIVE SMELL CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR MEANTIME HAD GONE ON THE BRIDGE AND INTO THE CHART ROOM
583-139009-0081 WHERE A LETTER COMMENCED TWO DAYS BEFORE AWAITED TERMINATION THESE LONG LETTERS BEGAN WITH THE WORDS MY DARLING WIFE AND THE STEWARD BETWEEN THE SCRUBBING OF THE FLOORS AND THE DUSTING OF CHRONOMETER BOXES SNATCHED AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO READ THEM
583-139009-0082 THEY INTERESTED HIM MUCH MORE THAN THEY POSSIBLY COULD THE WOMAN FOR WHOSE EYE THEY WERE INTENDED AND THIS FOR THE REASON THAT THEY RELATED IN MINUTE DETAIL EACH SUCCESSIVE TRIP OF THE NAN SHAN HER MASTER FAITHFUL TO FACTS WHICH ALONE HIS CONSCIOUSNESS REFLECTED
583-139009-0083 WOULD SET THEM DOWN WITH PAINSTAKING CARE UPON MANY PAGES THE HOUSE IN A NORTHERN SUBURB TO WHICH THESE PAGES WERE ADDRESSED HAD A BIT OF GARDEN BEFORE THE BOW WINDOWS A DEEP PORCH OF GOOD APPEARANCE COLOURED GLASS WITH IMITATION LEAD FRAME IN THE FRONT DOOR
583-139009-0084 A PRETENTIOUS PERSON WITH A SCRAGGY NECK AND A DISDAINFUL MANNER WAS ADMITTEDLY LADYLIKE AND IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD CONSIDERED AS QUITE SUPERIOR THE ONLY SECRET OF HER LIFE WAS HER ABJECT TERROR OF THE TIME WHEN HER HUSBAND WOULD COME HOME TO STAY FOR GOOD
583-139009-0085 UNDER THE SAME ROOF THERE DWELT ALSO A DAUGHTER CALLED LYDIA AND A SON TOM THESE TWO WERE BUT SLIGHTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR FATHER MAINLY THEY KNEW HIM AS A RARE BUT PRIVILEGED VISITOR
583-139009-0086 WHO OF AN EVENING SMOKED HIS PIPE IN THE DINING ROOM AND SLEPT IN THE HOUSE THE LANKY GIRL UPON THE WHOLE WAS RATHER ASHAMED OF HIM THE BOY WAS FRANKLY AND UTTERLY INDIFFERENT IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD DELIGHTFUL UNAFFECTED WAY MANLY BOYS HAVE
583-139009-0087 AND CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR WROTE HOME FROM THE COAST OF CHINA TWELVE TIMES EVERY YEAR DESIRING QUAINTLY TO BE REMEMBERED TO THE CHILDREN AND SUBSCRIBING HIMSELF YOUR LOVING HUSBAND
583-139009-0088 AS CALMLY AS IF THE WORDS SO LONG USED BY SO MANY MEN WERE APART FROM THEIR SHAPE WORN OUT THINGS AND OF A FADED MEANING THE CHINA SEAS NORTH AND SOUTH ARE NARROW SEAS
583-139009-0089 THEY ARE SEAS FULL OF EVERY DAY ELOQUENT FACTS SUCH AS ISLANDS SAND BANKS REEFS SWIFT AND CHANGEABLE CURRENTS TANGLED FACTS THAT NEVERTHELESS SPEAK TO A SEAMAN IN CLEAR AND DEFINITE LANGUAGE
583-139009-0090 THAT HE HAD GIVEN UP HIS STATE ROOM BELOW AND PRACTICALLY LIVED ALL HIS DAYS ON THE BRIDGE OF HIS SHIP OFTEN HAVING HIS MEALS SENT UP AND SLEEPING AT NIGHT IN THE CHART ROOM AND HE INDITED THERE HIS HOME LETTERS EACH OF THEM WITHOUT EXCEPTION CONTAINED THE PHRASE
583-139009-0091 THE WEATHER HAS BEEN VERY FINE THIS TRIP OR SOME OTHER FORM OF A STATEMENT TO THAT EFFECT AND THIS STATEMENT TOO IN ITS WONDERFUL PERSISTENCE WAS OF THE SAME PERFECT ACCURACY AS ALL THE OTHERS THEY CONTAINED MISTER ROUT LIKEWISE WROTE LETTERS
583-139009-0092 BECAUSE THE CHIEF ENGINEER HAD ENOUGH IMAGINATION TO KEEP HIS DESK LOCKED HIS WIFE RELISHED HIS STYLE GREATLY THEY WERE A CHILDLESS COUPLE AND MISSUS ROUT A BIG HIGH BOSOMED JOLLY WOMAN OF FORTY
583-139009-0093 SHARED WITH MISTER ROUT'S TOOTHLESS AND VENERABLE MOTHER A LITTLE COTTAGE NEAR TEDDINGTON SHE WOULD RUN OVER HER CORRESPONDENCE AT BREAKFAST WITH LIVELY EYES AND SCREAM OUT INTERESTING PASSAGES IN A JOYOUS VOICE AT THE DEAF OLD LADY PREFACING EACH EXTRACT BY THE WARNING SHOUT
583-139009-0094 SOLOMON SAYS SHE HAD THE TRICK OF FIRING OFF SOLOMON'S UTTERANCES ALSO UPON STRANGERS ASTONISHING THEM EASILY BY THE UNFAMILIAR TEXT AND THE UNEXPECTEDLY JOCULAR VEIN OF THESE QUOTATIONS ON THE DAY THE NEW CURATE CALLED FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THE COTTAGE
583-139009-0095 SHE FOUND OCCASION TO REMARK AS SOLOMON SAYS THE ENGINEERS THAT GO DOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS BEHOLD THE WONDERS OF SAILOR NATURE WHEN A CHANGE IN THE VISITOR'S COUNTENANCE MADE HER STOP AND STARE SOLOMON OH MISSUS ROUT
583-139009-0096 STUTTERED THE YOUNG MAN VERY RED IN THE FACE I MUST SAY I DON'T HE'S MY HUSBAND SHE ANNOUNCED IN A GREAT SHOUT THROWING HERSELF BACK IN THE CHAIR PERCEIVING THE JOKE SHE LAUGHED IMMODERATELY WITH A HANDKERCHIEF TO HER EYES
583-139009-0097 AND FROM HIS INEXPERIENCE OF JOLLY WOMEN FULLY PERSUADED THAT SHE MUST BE DEPLORABLY INSANE THEY WERE EXCELLENT FRIENDS AFTERWARDS
583-139009-0098 HE CAME TO THINK SHE WAS A VERY WORTHY PERSON INDEED AND HE LEARNED IN TIME TO RECEIVE WITHOUT FLINCHING OTHER SCRAPS OF SOLOMON'S WISDOM FOR MY PART
583-139009-0099 GIVE ME THE DULLEST ASS FOR A SKIPPER BEFORE A ROGUE
583-139009-0100 HAD THE HEAVY OBVIOUSNESS OF A LUMP OF CLAY ON THE OTHER HAND MISTER JUKES UNABLE TO GENERALIZE UNMARRIED AND UNENGAGED WAS IN THE HABIT OF OPENING HIS HEART AFTER ANOTHER FASHION TO AN OLD CHUM AND FORMER SHIPMATE
583-139009-0101 ACTUALLY SERVING AS SECOND OFFICER ON BOARD AN ATLANTIC LINER FIRST OF ALL HE WOULD INSIST UPON THE ADVANTAGES OF THE EASTERN TRADE HINTING AT ITS SUPERIORITY TO THE WESTERN OCEAN SERVICE
583-139009-0102 HE EXTOLLED THE SKY THE SEAS THE SHIPS AND THE EASY LIFE OF THE FAR EAST THE NAN SHAN HE AFFIRMED WAS SECOND TO NONE AS A SEA BOAT WE HAVE NO BRASS BOUND UNIFORMS BUT THEN WE ARE LIKE BROTHERS HERE HE WROTE
583-139009-0103 WE ALL MESS TOGETHER AND LIVE LIKE FIGHTING COCKS ALL THE CHAPS OF THE BLACK SQUAD ARE AS DECENT AS THEY MAKE THAT KIND AND OLD SOL THE CHIEF IS A DRY STICK WE ARE GOOD FRIENDS AS TO OUR OLD MAN YOU COULD NOT FIND A QUIETER SKIPPER
583-139009-0104 SOMETIMES YOU WOULD THINK HE HADN'T SENSE ENOUGH TO SEE ANYTHING WRONG AND YET IT ISN'T THAT
583-139009-0105 I BELIEVE HE HASN'T BRAINS ENOUGH TO ENJOY KICKING UP A ROW I DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIM I WOULD SCORN IT OUTSIDE THE ROUTINE OF DUTY HE DOESN'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND MORE THAN HALF OF WHAT YOU TELL HIM WE GET A LAUGH OUT OF THIS AT TIMES
583-139009-0106 BUT IT IS DULL TOO TO BE WITH A MAN LIKE THIS IN THE LONG RUN OLD SOL SAYS HE HASN'T MUCH CONVERSATION CONVERSATION O LORD HE NEVER TALKS THE OTHER DAY I HAD BEEN YARNING UNDER THE BRIDGE WITH ONE OF THE ENGINEERS AND HE MUST HAVE HEARD US
583-139009-0107 THAT'S HIS REGULAR PERFORMANCE BY AND BY HE SAYS
583-139009-0108 YES SIR WITH THE THIRD ENGINEER YES SIR HE WALKS OFF TO STARBOARD AND SITS UNDER THE DODGER ON A LITTLE CAMPSTOOL OF HIS AND FOR HALF AN HOUR PERHAPS HE MAKES NO SOUND EXCEPT THAT I HEARD HIM SNEEZE ONCE THEN AFTER A WHILE
583-139009-0109 I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU CAN FIND TO TALK ABOUT SAYS HE
583-139009-0110 I SEE PEOPLE ASHORE AT IT ALL DAY LONG AND THEN IN THE EVENING THEY SIT DOWN AND KEEP AT IT OVER THE DRINKS MUST BE SAYING THE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN I CAN'T UNDERSTAND DID YOU EVER HEAR ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND HE WAS SO PATIENT ABOUT IT
583-139009-0111 IT MADE ME QUITE SORRY FOR HIM BUT HE IS EXASPERATING TOO SOMETIMES
583-139009-0112 BUT IT ISN'T HE'S SO JOLLY INNOCENT THAT IF YOU WERE TO PUT YOUR THUMB TO YOUR NOSE AND WAVE YOUR FINGERS AT HIM
583-139009-0113 HE'S TOO DENSE TO TROUBLE ABOUT AND THAT'S THE TRUTH
583-139009-0114 OUT OF THE FULNESS OF HIS HEART AND THE LIVELINESS OF HIS FANCY HE HAD EXPRESSED HIS HONEST OPINION IT WAS NOT WORTHWHILE TRYING TO IMPRESS A MAN OF THAT SORT IF THE WORLD HAD BEEN FULL OF SUCH MEN
583-139009-0115 HE WAS NOT ALONE IN HIS OPINION THE SEA ITSELF AS IF SHARING MISTER JUKES GOOD NATURED FORBEARANCE HAD NEVER PUT ITSELF OUT TO STARTLE THE SILENT MAN WHO SELDOM LOOKED UP AND WANDERED INNOCENTLY OVER THE WATERS WITH THE ONLY VISIBLE PURPOSE OF GETTING FOOD
583-139009-0116 DIRTY WEATHER HE HAD KNOWN OF COURSE HE HAD BEEN MADE WET UNCOMFORTABLE TIRED IN THE USUAL WAY FELT AT THE TIME AND PRESENTLY FORGOTTEN SO THAT UPON THE WHOLE HE HAD BEEN JUSTIFIED IN REPORTING FINE WEATHER AT HOME
583-139009-0117 BUT HE HAD NEVER BEEN GIVEN A GLIMPSE OF IMMEASURABLE STRENGTH AND OF IMMODERATE WRATH THE WRATH THAT PASSES EXHAUSTED BUT NEVER APPEASED THE WRATH AND FURY OF THE PASSIONATE SEA HE KNEW IT EXISTED
583-139009-0118 AS WE KNOW THAT CRIME AND ABOMINATIONS EXIST HE HAD HEARD OF IT AS A PEACEABLE CITIZEN IN A TOWN HEARS OF BATTLES FAMINES AND FLOODS AND YET KNOWS NOTHING OF WHAT THESE THINGS MEAN THOUGH
583-139009-0119 HAVE GONE WITHOUT HIS DINNER ONCE OR BEEN SOAKED TO THE SKIN IN A SHOWER CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR HAD SAILED OVER THE SURFACE OF THE OCEANS AS SOME MEN GO SKIMMING OVER THE YEARS OF EXISTENCE TO SINK GENTLY INTO A PLACID GRAVE IGNORANT OF LIFE TO THE LAST
583-139009-0120 WITHOUT EVER HAVING BEEN MADE TO SEE ALL IT MAY CONTAIN OF PERFIDY OF VIOLENCE AND OF TERROR THERE ARE ON SEA AND LAND SUCH MEN THUS FORTUNATE
