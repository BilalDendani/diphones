1901-48014-0000 JUSTIN PEABODY HAD ONCE FAITHFULLY STRUGGLED WITH THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES OF LIFE IN EDGEWOOD OR SO HE HAD THOUGHT IN THOSE OLD DAYS OF WHICH NANCY WENTWORTH WAS THINKING AS SHE WIPED THE PAINT OF THE PEABODY PEW
1901-48014-0001 WORK IN THE MILLS DID NOT ATTRACT HIM HE HAD NO CAPITAL TO INVEST IN A STOCK OF GOODS FOR STORE KEEPING SCHOOL TEACHING OFFERED HIM ONLY A PITTANCE THERE REMAINED THEN ONLY THE FARM IF HE WERE TO STAY AT HOME AND KEEP HIS MOTHER COMPANY
1901-48014-0002 JUSTIN DON'T SEEM TO TAKE NO HOLT OF THINGS SAID THE NEIGHBOURS GOOD HEAVENS
1901-48014-0003 AND THE ELEMENTS HOWEVER MUCH THEY MIGHT SEEM TO FAVOUR HIS NEIGHBOURS SELDOM SMILED ON HIS ENTERPRISES THE CROWS LIKED JUSTIN'S CORN BETTER THAN ANY OTHER IN EDGEWOOD IT HAD A RICHNESS PECULIAR TO ITSELF
1901-48014-0004 JUSTIN COULD EXPLAIN THE ATTITUDE OF CATERPILLARS WORMS GRASSHOPPERS AND POTATO BUGS TOWARD HIM ONLY BY ASSUMING THAT HE ATTRACTED THEM AS THE MAGNET IN THE TOY BOXES ATTRACTS THE MINIATURE FISHES LAND OF LIBERTY
1901-48014-0005 LOOK AT EM CONGREGATE EJACULATED JABE SLOCUM WHEN HE WAS CALLED IN FOR CONSULTATION NOW IF YOU'D GONE IN FOR BREEDIN INSECKS YOU COULD BE AS PROUD AS CUFFY AN EXHIBIT EM AT THE COUNTY FAIR
1901-48014-0006 THEY'D GIVE YER PRIZES FOR SIZE AN NUMBERS AN SPEED I GUESS WHY SAY THEY'RE REAL CROWDED FOR ROOM THE PLANTS AIN'T GIVE EM ENOUGH LEAVES TO ROOST ON HAVE YOU TRIED BUG DEATH
1901-48014-0007 IT ACTS LIKE A TONIC ON THEM SAID JUSTIN GLOOMILY
1901-48014-0008 NOW MINE CAN'T ABIDE THE SIGHT NOR SMELL OF IT WHAT BOUT PARIS GREEN THEY THRIVE ON IT IT'S AS GOOD AS AN APPETIZER
1901-48014-0009 JUSTIN DID JUST THAT AS A MATTER OF FACT A YEAR OR TWO LATER BUT STOCK THAT HAS WITHIN ITSELF THE POWER OF BEING LIVE HAS ALSO RARE QUALIFICATIONS FOR BEING DEAD WHEN OCCASION SUITS
1901-48014-0010 AND IT GENERALLY DID SUIT JUSTIN'S STOCK IT PROVED PRONE NOT ONLY TO ALL THE GENERAL DISEASES THAT CATTLE FLESH IS HEIR TO BUT WAS CAPABLE EVEN OF SUICIDE AT LEAST IT IS TRUE
1901-48014-0011 THAT TWO VALUABLE JERSEY CALVES TIED TO STAKES ON THE HILLSIDE HAD FLUNG THEMSELVES VIOLENTLY DOWN THE BANK AND STRANGLED THEMSELVES WITH THEIR OWN ROPES IN A MANNER WHICH SEEMED TO SHOW THAT THEY FOUND NO PLEASURE IN EXISTENCE AT ALL EVENTS ON THE PEABODY FARM
1901-48014-0012 THESE WERE SOME OF THE LITTLE TRAGEDIES THAT HAD SICKENED YOUNG JUSTIN PEABODY WITH LIFE IN EDGEWOOD AND NANCY WENTWORTH EVEN THEN REALIZED SOME OF THEM AND SYMPATHIZED WITHOUT SPEAKING IN A GIRL'S POOR HELPLESS WAY
1901-48014-0013 MISSUS SIMPSON HAD WASHED THE FLOOR IN THE RIGHT WING OF THE CHURCH AND NANCY HAD CLEANED ALL THE PAINT NOW SHE SAT IN THE OLD PEABODY PEW DARNING THE FORLORN FADED CUSHION WITH GREY CARPET THREAD THREAD AS GREY AS HER OWN LIFE
1901-48014-0014 AND TWO OF THE WOMEN WERE BEGINNING PREPARATIONS FOR THE BASKET LUNCHEONS NANCY'S NEEDLE WAS NO BUSIER THAN HER MEMORY LONG YEARS AGO SHE HAD OFTEN SAT IN THE PEABODY PEW SOMETIMES AT FIRST AS A GIRL OF SIXTEEN WHEN ASKED BY ESTHER
1901-48014-0015 AND THEN ON COMING HOME FROM SCHOOL AT EIGHTEEN FINISHED SHE HAD BEEN INVITED NOW AND AGAIN BY MISSUS PEABODY HERSELF ON THOSE SUNDAYS WHEN HER OWN INVALID MOTHER HAD NOT ATTENDED SERVICE THOSE WERE WONDERFUL SUNDAYS
1901-48014-0016 SUNDAYS OF QUIET TREMBLING PEACE AND MAIDEN JOY JUSTIN SAT BESIDE HER AND SHE HAD BEEN SURE THEN BUT HAD LONG SINCE GROWN TO DOUBT THE EVIDENCE OF HER SENSES THAT HE TOO
1901-48014-0017 VIBRATED WITH PLEASURE AT THE NEARNESS WAS THERE NOT A SUMMER MORNING WHEN HIS HAND TOUCHED HER WHITE LACE MITT AS THEY HELD THE HYMN BOOK TOGETHER AND THE LINES OF THE RISE MY SOUL AND STRETCH THY WINGS THY BETTER PORTION TRACE
1901-48014-0018 BECAME BLURRED ON THE PAGE AND MELTED INTO SOMETHING INDISTINGUISHABLE FOR A FULL MINUTE OR TWO AFTERWARD WERE THERE NOT LOOKS AND LOOKS AND LOOKS OR HAD SHE SOME MISLEADING TRICK OF VISION IN THOSE DAYS
1901-48014-0019 JUSTIN'S DARK HANDSOME PROFILE ROSE BEFORE HER THE LEVEL BROWS AND FINE LASHES THE WELL CUT NOSE AND LOVABLE MOUTH THE PEABODY MOUTH AND CHIN SOMEWHAT TOO SWEET AND PLIANT FOR STRENGTH PERHAPS
1901-48014-0020 THEN THE EYES TURNED TO HERS IN THE OLD WAY JUST FOR A FLEETING GLANCE AS THEY HAD SO OFTEN DONE AT PRAYER MEETING OR SOCIABLE OR SUNDAY SERVICE WAS IT NOT A MAN'S HEART SHE HAD SEEN IN THEM
1901-48014-0021 AND OH IF SHE COULD ONLY BE SURE THAT HER OWN WOMAN'S HEART HAD NOT LOOKED OUT FROM HERS DRAWN FROM ITS MAIDEN SHELTER IN SPITE OF ALL HER WISH TO KEEP IT HIDDEN
1901-48014-0022 THEN FOLLOWED TWO DREARY YEARS OF INDECISION AND SUSPENSE WHEN JUSTIN'S EYES MET HERS LESS FREELY WHEN HIS LOOKS WERE ALWAYS GLOOMY AND ANXIOUS WHEN AFFAIRS AT THE PEABODY FARM GREW WORSE AND WORSE
1901-48014-0023 WHEN HIS MOTHER FOLLOWED HER HUSBAND THE OLD DEACON AND HER DAUGHTER ESTHER TO THE BURYING GROUND IN THE CHURCHYARD THEN THE END OF ALL THINGS CAME THE END OF THE WORLD FOR NANCY
1901-48014-0024 JUSTIN'S DEPARTURE FOR THE WEST IN A VERY FRENZY OF DISCOURAGEMENT OVER THE NARROWNESS AND LIMITATION AND INJUSTICE OF HIS LOT OVER THE ROCKINESS AND BARRENNESS AND UNKINDNESS OF THE NEW ENGLAND SOIL OVER THE GENERAL BITTERNESS OF FATE
1901-48014-0025 AND THE BLUDGEONINGS OF CHANCE HE WAS A FAILURE BORN OF A FAMILY OF FAILURES IF THE WORLD OWED HIM A LIVING HE HAD YET TO FIND THE METHOD BY WHICH IT COULD BE EARNED ALL THIS HE THOUGHT AND UTTERED AND MUCH MORE OF THE SAME SORT
1901-48014-0026 IN THESE DAYS OF HUMBLED PRIDE SELF WAS PARAMOUNT THOUGH IT WAS A SELF HE DESPISED THERE WAS NO TIME FOR LOVE WHO WAS HE FOR A GIRL TO LEAN UPON HE WHO COULD NOT STAND ERECT HIMSELF
1901-48014-0027 HE BADE A STIFF GOOD BYE TO HIS NEIGHBOURS AND TO NANCY HE VOUCHSAFED LITTLE MORE A HANDSHAKE WITH NO THRILL OF LOVE IN IT SUCH AS MIGHT HAVE FURNISHED HER PALM AT LEAST SOME MEMORIES TO DWELL UPON
1901-48014-0028 A FEW STILTED WORDS OF LEAVE TAKING A HALTING MEANINGLESS SENTENCE OR TWO ABOUT HIS BOTCH OF LIFE THEN HE WALKED AWAY FROM THE WENTWORTH DOORSTEP BUT HALF WAY DOWN THE GARDEN PATH
1901-48014-0029 WHERE THE SHRIVELLED HOLLYHOCKS STOOD LIKE SENTINELS DID A WAVE OF SOMETHING DIFFERENT SWEEP OVER HIM A WAVE OF THE BOYISH IRRESPONSIBLE PAST WHEN HIS HEART HAD WINGS AND COULD FLY WITHOUT FEAR TO ITS MATE
1901-48014-0030 A WAVE OF THE PAST THAT WAS RUSHING THROUGH NANCY'S MIND WELL NIGH BURYING HER IN ITS BITTER SWEET WATERS FOR HE LIFTED HIS HEAD AND SUDDENLY RETRACING HIS STEPS HE CAME TOWARD HER AND TAKING HER HAND AGAIN
1901-48014-0031 SAID FORLORNLY YOU'LL SEE ME BACK WHEN MY LUCK TURNS NANCY NANCY KNEW THAT THE WORDS MIGHT MEAN LITTLE OR MUCH ACCORDING TO THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY WERE UTTERED BUT TO HER HURT PRIDE AND SORE SHAMED WOMAN INSTINCT
1901-48014-0032 THEY WERE A PROMISE SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE WAS A CHOKING SOUND IN JUSTIN'S VOICE AND TEARS IN JUSTIN'S EYES YOU'LL SEE ME BACK WHEN MY LUCK TURNS NANCY THIS WAS THE PHRASE UPON WHICH SHE HAD LIVED FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS
1901-48014-0033 NANCY HAD ONCE HEARD THE OLD PARSON SAY AGES AGO THAT THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF LIFE WAS THE GROWTH OF THE SOUL THAT WE EAT SLEEP CLOTHE OURSELVES WORK LOVE
1901-48014-0034 ALL TO GIVE THE SOUL ANOTHER DAY MONTH YEAR IN WHICH TO DEVELOP SHE USED TO WONDER IF HER SOUL COULD BE GROWING IN THE MONOTONOUS ROUND OF HER DULL DUTIES AND HER DULLER PLEASURES SHE DID NOT CONFESS IT EVEN TO HERSELF
1901-48014-0035 NEVERTHELESS SHE KNEW THAT SHE WORKED ATE SLEPT TO LIVE UNTIL JUSTIN'S LUCK TURNED HER LOVE HAD LAIN IN HER HEART A BIRD WITHOUT A SONG YEAR AFTER YEAR HER MOTHER HAD DWELT BY HER SIDE AND NEVER GUESSED
1901-48014-0036 THE NEIGHBOURS ALSO LYNX EYED AND CURIOUS HAD NEVER SUSPECTED IF SHE HAD SUFFERED NO ONE IN EDGEWOOD WAS ANY THE WISER FOR THE MAIDEN HEART IS NOT COMMONLY WORN ON THE SLEEVE IN NEW ENGLAND
1901-48014-0037 IF SHE HAD BEEN OPENLY PLEDGED TO JUSTIN PEABODY SHE COULD HAVE WAITED TWICE TEN YEARS WITH A DECENT SHOW OF SELF RESPECT FOR LONG ENGAGEMENTS WERE VIEWED RATHER AS A MATTER OF COURSE IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD
1901-48014-0038 THE ENDLESS MONTHS HAD GONE ON SINCE THAT GREY NOVEMBER DAY WHEN JUSTIN HAD SAID GOOD BYE IT HAD BEEN JUST BEFORE THANKSGIVING AND SHE WENT TO CHURCH WITH AN ACHING AND UNGRATEFUL HEART
1901-48014-0039 THE PARSON READ FROM THE EIGHTH CHAPTER OF SAINT MATTHEW A MOST UNEXPECTED SELECTION FOR THAT HOLIDAY IF YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING ELSE TO BE THANKFUL FOR HE CRIED GO HOME AND BE THANKFUL YOU ARE NOT A LEPER
1901-48014-0040 NANCY TOOK THE DRASTIC COUNSEL AWAY FROM THE CHURCH WITH HER AND IT WAS MANY A YEAR BEFORE SHE COULD MANAGE TO ADD TO THIS SLENDER STORE ANYTHING TO INCREASE HER GRATITUDE FOR MERCIES GIVEN
1901-48014-0041 THOUGH ALL THE TIME SHE WAS OUTWARDLY BUSY CHEERFUL AND HELPFUL JUSTIN HAD ONCE COME BACK TO EDGEWOOD AND IT WAS THE BITTEREST DROP IN HER CUP OF BITTERNESS THAT SHE WAS SPENDING THAT WINTER IN BERWICK
