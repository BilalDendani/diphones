6060-58090-0000 TO ASSEMBLE AT MANTUA ABOUT WHITSUNTIDE AND AFTERWARDS TRANSFERRED IT FROM MANTUA SO THAT IT IS NOT YET KNOWN WHERE HE WILL OR CAN FIX IT AND WE ON OUR PART EITHER HAD TO EXPECT THAT WE WOULD BE SUMMONED ALSO TO THE COUNCIL OR
6060-58090-0001 TO FEAR THAT WE WOULD BE CONDEMNED UNSUMMONED I WAS DIRECTED TO COMPILE AND COLLECT THE ARTICLES OF OUR DOCTRINE IN ORDER THAT IT MIGHT BE PLAIN IN CASE OF DELIBERATION AS TO WHAT AND HOW FAR WE WOULD BE BOTH WILLING AND ABLE TO YIELD TO THE PAPISTS
6060-58090-0002 AND IN WHAT POINTS WE INTENDED TO PERSEVERE AND ABIDE TO THE END I HAVE ACCORDINGLY COMPILED THESE ARTICLES AND PRESENTED THEM TO OUR SIDE THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN ACCEPTED AND UNANIMOUSLY CONFESSED BY OUR SIDE
6060-58090-0003 AND IT HAS BEEN RESOLVED THAT IN CASE THE POPE WITH HIS ADHERENTS SHOULD EVER BE SO BOLD AS SERIOUSLY AND IN GOOD FAITH WITHOUT LYING AND CHEATING TO HOLD A TRULY FREE LEGITIMATE CHRISTIAN COUNCIL
6060-58090-0004 AS INDEED HE WOULD BE IN DUTY BOUND TO DO THEY BE PUBLICLY DELIVERED IN ORDER TO SET FORTH THE CONFESSION OF OUR FAITH BUT THOUGH THE ROMISH COURT IS SO DREADFULLY AFRAID OF A FREE CHRISTIAN COUNCIL
6060-58090-0005 AND SHUNS THE LIGHT SO SHAMEFULLY THAT IT HAS ENTIRELY REMOVED EVEN FROM THOSE WHO ARE ON ITS SIDE THE HOPE THAT IT WILL EVER PERMIT A FREE COUNCIL MUCH LESS THAT IT WILL ITSELF HOLD ONE WHEREAT AS IS JUST
6060-58090-0006 THEY MANY PAPISTS ARE GREATLY OFFENDED AND HAVE NO LITTLE TROUBLE ON THAT ACCOUNT ARE DISGUSTED WITH THIS NEGLIGENCE OF THE POPE SINCE THEY NOTICE THEREBY THAT THE POPE WOULD RATHER SEE ALL CHRISTENDOM PERISH AND ALL SOULS DAMNED
6060-58090-0007 THAN SUFFER EITHER HIMSELF OR HIS ADHERENTS TO BE REFORMED EVEN A LITTLE AND HIS THEIR TYRANNY TO BE LIMITED NEVERTHELESS I HAVE DETERMINED MEANWHILE TO PUBLISH THESE ARTICLES IN PLAIN PRINT
6060-58090-0008 SO THAT SHOULD I DIE BEFORE THERE WOULD BE A COUNCIL AS I FULLY EXPECT AND HOPE BECAUSE THE KNAVES WHO FLEE THE LIGHT AND SHUN THE DAY TAKE SUCH WRETCHED PAINS TO DELAY AND HINDER THE COUNCIL THOSE WHO LIVE AND REMAIN AFTER ME
6060-58090-0009 MAY HAVE MY TESTIMONY AND CONFESSION TO PRODUCE IN ADDITION TO THE CONFESSION WHICH I HAVE ISSUED PREVIOUSLY WHEREBY UP TO THIS TIME I HAVE ABIDED AND BY GOD'S GRACE WILL ABIDE FOR WHAT SHALL I SAY
6060-58090-0010 HOW SHALL I COMPLAIN I AM STILL LIVING WRITING PREACHING AND LECTURING DAILY AND YET THERE ARE FOUND SUCH SPITEFUL MEN NOT ONLY AMONG THE ADVERSARIES BUT ALSO FALSE BRETHREN THAT PROFESS TO BE ON OUR SIDE
6060-58090-0011 AS DARE TO CITE MY WRITINGS AND DOCTRINE DIRECTLY AGAINST MYSELF AND LET ME LOOK ON AND LISTEN ALTHOUGH THEY KNOW WELL THAT I TEACH OTHERWISE AND AS WISH TO ADORN THEIR VENOM WITH MY LABOR
6060-58090-0012 AND UNDER MY NAME TO DECEIVE AND MISLEAD THE POOR PEOPLE GOOD GOD ALAS WHAT FIRST WILL HAPPEN WHEN I AM DEAD INDEED I OUGHT TO REPLY TO EVERYTHING WHILE I AM STILL LIVING BUT AGAIN
6060-58090-0013 HOW CAN I ALONE STOP ALL THE MOUTHS OF THE DEVIL ESPECIALLY OF THOSE AS THEY ALL ARE POISONED WHO WILL NOT HEAR OR NOTICE WHAT WE WRITE BUT SOLELY EXERCISE THEMSELVES WITH ALL DILIGENCE HOW THEY MAY MOST SHAMEFULLY PERVERT AND CORRUPT OUR
6060-58090-0014 WORD IN EVERY LETTER THESE I LET THE DEVIL ANSWER
6060-58090-0015 I OFTEN THINK OF THE GOOD GERSON WHO DOUBTS WHETHER ANYTHING GOOD SHOULD BE WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED IF IT IS NOT DONE MANY SOULS ARE NEGLECTED WHO COULD BE DELIVERED
6060-58090-0016 BUT IF IT IS DONE THE DEVIL IS THERE WITH MALIGNANT VILLAINOUS TONGUES WITHOUT NUMBER WHICH ENVENOM AND PERVERT EVERYTHING SO THAT NEVERTHELESS THE FRUIT THE USEFULNESS OF THE WRITINGS IS PREVENTED
6060-58090-0017 YET WHAT THEY GAIN THEREBY IS MANIFEST FOR WHILE THEY HAVE LIED SO SHAMEFULLY AGAINST US AND BY MEANS OF LIES WISHED TO RETAIN THE PEOPLE GOD HAS CONSTANTLY ADVANCED HIS WORK AND BEEN MAKING THEIR FOLLOWING EVER SMALLER
6060-58090-0018 AND OURS GREATER AND BY THEIR LIES HAS CAUSED AND STILL CAUSES THEM TO BE BROUGHT TO SHAME I MUST TELL A STORY THERE WAS A DOCTOR SENT HERE TO WITTENBERG FROM FRANCE
6060-58090-0019 WHO SAID PUBLICLY BEFORE US THAT HIS KING WAS SURE AND MORE THAN SURE THAT AMONG US THERE IS NO CHURCH NO MAGISTRATE NO MARRIED LIFE BUT ALL LIVE PROMISCUOUSLY AS CATTLE AND EACH ONE DOES AS HE PLEASES
6060-58090-0020 IMAGINE NOW HOW WILL THOSE WHO BY THEIR WRITINGS HAVE INSTILLED SUCH GROSS LIES INTO THE KING AND OTHER COUNTRIES AS THE PURE TRUTH LOOK AT US ON THAT DAY BEFORE THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST CHRIST
6060-58090-0021 THE LORD AND JUDGE OF US ALL KNOWS WELL THAT THEY LIE AND HAVE ALWAYS LIED HIS SENTENCE THEY IN TURN MUST HEAR THAT I KNOW CERTAINLY GOD CONVERT TO REPENTANCE THOSE WHO CAN BE CONVERTED
6060-58090-0022 REGARDING THE REST IT WILL BE SAID WOE AND ALAS ETERNALLY BUT TO RETURN TO THE SUBJECT I VERILY DESIRE TO SEE A TRULY CHRISTIAN COUNCIL ASSEMBLED SOME TIME
6060-58090-0023 IN ORDER THAT MANY MATTERS AND PERSONS MIGHT BE HELPED NOT THAT WE NEED IT FOR OUR CHURCHES ARE NOW THROUGH GOD'S GRACE SO ENLIGHTENED AND EQUIPPED WITH THE PURE WORD AND RIGHT USE OF THE SACRAMENTS WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE VARIOUS CALLINGS
6060-58090-0024 AND OF RIGHT WORKS THAT WE ON OUR PART ASK FOR NO COUNCIL AND ON SUCH POINTS HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO HOPE OR EXPECT FROM A COUNCIL BUT WE SEE IN THE BISHOPRICS EVERYWHERE SO MANY PARISHES VACANT AND DESOLATE
6060-58090-0025 THAT ONE'S HEART WOULD BREAK AND YET NEITHER THE BISHOPS NOR CANONS CARE HOW THE POOR PEOPLE LIVE OR DIE FOR WHOM NEVERTHELESS CHRIST HAS DIED AND WHO ARE NOT PERMITTED TO HEAR HIM SPEAK WITH THEM AS THE TRUE SHEPHERD WITH HIS SHEEP
6060-58090-0026 THIS CAUSES ME TO SHUDDER AND FEAR THAT AT SOME TIME HE MAY SEND A COUNCIL OF ANGELS UPON GERMANY UTTERLY DESTROYING US LIKE SODOM AND GOMORRAH BECAUSE WE SO WANTONLY MOCK HIM WITH THE COUNCIL
6060-58090-0027 BESIDES SUCH NECESSARY ECCLESIASTICAL AFFAIRS THERE WOULD BE ALSO IN THE POLITICAL ESTATE INNUMERABLE MATTERS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO IMPROVE THERE IS THE DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PRINCES AND THE STATES
6060-58090-0028 USURY AND AVARICE HAVE BURST IN LIKE A FLOOD AND HAVE BECOME LAWFUL ARE DEFENDED WITH A SHOW OF RIGHT WANTONNESS LEWDNESS EXTRAVAGANCE IN DRESS GLUTTONY GAMBLING IDLE DISPLAY
6060-58090-0029 WITH ALL KINDS OF BAD HABITS AND WICKEDNESS INSUBORDINATION OF SUBJECTS OF DOMESTICS AND LABORERS OF EVERY TRADE ALSO THE EXACTIONS AND MOST EXORBITANT SELLING PRICES OF THE PEASANTS AND WHO CAN ENUMERATE ALL
6060-58090-0030 HAVE SO INCREASED THAT THEY CANNOT BE RECTIFIED BY TEN COUNCILS AND TWENTY DIETS IF SUCH CHIEF MATTERS OF THE SPIRITUAL AND WORLDLY ESTATES AS ARE CONTRARY TO GOD WOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE COUNCIL
6060-58090-0031 THEY WOULD HAVE ALL HANDS SO FULL THAT THE CHILD'S PLAY AND ABSURDITY OF LONG GOWNS OFFICIAL INSIGNIA LARGE TONSURES BROAD CINCTURES OR SASHES BISHOPS OR CARDINALS HATS OR MACES AND LIKE JUGGLERY
6060-58090-0032 WOULD IN THE MEAN TIME BE FORGOTTEN IF WE FIRST HAD PERFORMED GOD'S COMMAND AND ORDER IN THE SPIRITUAL AND SECULAR ESTATE WE WOULD FIND TIME ENOUGH TO REFORM FOOD CLOTHING
6060-58090-0033 BUT IF WE WANT TO SWALLOW SUCH CAMELS AND INSTEAD STRAIN AT GNATS LET THE BEAMS STAND AND JUDGE THE MOTES WE ALSO MIGHT INDEED BE SATISFIED WITH THE COUNCIL THEREFORE I HAVE PRESENTED
6060-58090-0034 FEW ARTICLES FOR WE HAVE WITHOUT THIS SO MANY COMMANDS OF GOD TO OBSERVE IN THE CHURCH THE STATE AND THE FAMILY THAT WE CAN NEVER FULFIL THEM WHAT THEN IS THE USE
6060-58090-0035 OR WHAT DOES IT PROFIT THAT MANY DECREES AND STATUTES THEREON ARE MADE IN THE COUNCIL ESPECIALLY WHEN THESE CHIEF MATTERS COMMANDED OF GOD ARE NEITHER REGARDED NOR OBSERVED JUST AS THOUGH HE WERE BOUND TO HONOR OUR JUGGLERY
6060-58090-0036 AS A REWARD OF OUR TREADING HIS SOLEMN COMMANDMENTS UNDER FOOT BUT OUR SINS WEIGH UPON US AND CAUSE GOD NOT TO BE GRACIOUS TO US FOR WE DO NOT REPENT AND BESIDES WISH TO DEFEND EVERY ABOMINATION
6060-58090-0037 O LORD JESUS CHRIST DO THOU THYSELF CONVOKE A COUNCIL AND DELIVER THY SERVANTS BY THY GLORIOUS ADVENT THE POPE AND HIS ADHERENTS ARE DONE FOR THEY WILL HAVE NONE OF THEE
6060-58090-0038 DO THOU THEN HELP US WHO ARE POOR AND NEEDY WHO SIGH TO THEE AND BESEECH THEE EARNESTLY ACCORDING TO THE GRACE WHICH THOU HAST GIVEN US THROUGH THY HOLY GHOST WHO LIVETH AND REIGNETH WITH THEE AND THE FATHER
