6102-56178-0004 FOR MY OWN PART I SHALL BE AWFULLY GLAD TO HAVE THE BAZAAR OVER WITH THE WEATHER IS ALTOGETHER TOO FINE TO WASTE INDOORS ON FANCY WORK BUT UNTIL WE HAVE THAT MONEY FOR MANUEL
6102-56178-0005 NOW THE PLANS FOR THE BAZAAR HAD RECEIVED MUCH ATTENTION FROM THE OLDER PERSONS IN THE FAMILIES OF THE YOUNG WORKERS AND THE ENCOURAGEMENT THAT THEY HAD HAD FROM THEIR ELDERS WAS NOW THEIR CHIEF INCENTIVE
6102-56178-0006 EDITH'S MOTHER HAD OFFERED THEM THE USE OF A LARGE DRAWING ROOM IN HER HOUSE WHICH WAS JUST ADAPTED TO AN AFFAIR OF THIS KIND
6102-56178-0007 ITS WALLS PANELED WITH MIRRORS WOULD REFLECT THE TABLES OF FANCY WORK IN SUCH A WAY AS TO MAKE IT SEEM
6102-56178-0008 BRENDA AND BELLE WISHED A SMALL ORCHESTRA ENGAGED TO PLAY DURING THE EVENING OF THE BAZAAR AND FURNISH MUSIC FOR DANCING AT THE CLOSE OF THE SALE EDITH AND NORA WERE AFRAID THAT THIS WOULD EAT UP TOO MUCH OF THEIR PROFITS BUT BRENDA WAS VERY DECIDED IN HER VIEWS
6102-56178-0009 JUST QUANTITIES AND THEN THE REFRESHMENT TABLE AND
6102-56178-0010 WHAT GOOD WILL THAT DO ENQUIRED THE PRACTICAL NORA WE CAN'T MAKE MUCH OUT OF THINGS THAT WE CAN'T SELL

6102-56178-0013 AND THIS YEAR EASTER FELL ALMOST IN THE MIDDLE OF APRIL DURING THE LAST DAYS OF SCHOOL PRECEDING THE EASTER VACATION THE FOUR DID MUCH CANVASSING AMONG THEIR FRIENDS TO SEE WHETHER ALL THE ARTICLES PROMISED WERE FINISHED OF COURSE THERE WERE SEVERAL DISAPPOINTMENTS
6102-56178-0014 BUT HAD COLLECTED MANY PRETTY AND EVEN VALUABLE ARTICLES FROM THEIR FRIENDS ALL THE SCHOOL GIRLS NEAR THE AGE OF THE FOUR WERE INVITED TO ASSIST AT THE TABLES THE FOUR RESOLVED THEMSELVES INTO AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ADDING TO THEIR NUMBER JULIA
6102-56178-0015 TO WHOM THE REMARK HAPPENED TO BE MADE
6102-56178-0016 YOU ARE GROWING VERY TIRESOME AND IF I WERE YOU I SHOULD TRY TO BE LESS NARROW MINDED
6102-56178-0017 PERHAPS THAT IS WHAT I DO THINK ANSWERED FRANCES WE CAN'T MAKE INTIMATE FRIENDS OF EVERY ONE IN THE WORLD AND WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THOSE WHO ARE NOT IN OUR OWN SET I HATE THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO PUSH IN IF YOU MEAN RUTH
6102-56178-0018 SHE THINKS QUITE AS WELL OF HERSELF AS YOU DO OF YOURSELF
6102-56178-0019 EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT GOVERNORS OF MASSACHUSETTS NOW DESPITE THE FACT THAT THIS SPEECH WHEN QUOTED SOUNDS RATHER
6102-56178-0020 THAT SHE HAD HERSELF SO ALTHOUGH BOTH GIRLS TURNED AWAY FROM EACH OTHER WITH AN ANNOYED EXPRESSION ON THEIR FACES THEIR NEXT MEETING WAS PERFECTLY AMICABLE
6102-56178-0021 CANNOT DO THIS OR I CANNOT DO THAT BECAUSE I AM A POUNDER MISSUS GOSTAR LAUGHED AT THIS SPEECH AND THE GESTURE AND TOSSING BACK OF THE HEAD WITH WHICH NORA EMPHASIZED IT FRANCES HARDLY SAYS THAT DOES SHE SHE ENQUIRED
6102-56178-0022 AND I AM SURE THAT SHE FEELS LIKE SAYING IT ALL THE TIME
6102-56178-0023 AND OTHER PEOPLE LIKE THAT IN HER FAMILY SOMEWHERE IN THE DIM PAST
6102-56178-0024 THERE THERE INTERRUPTED HER MOTHER AREN'T YOU GROWING UNCHARITABLE YOURSELF
6102-56178-0025 HER FAMILY HAS HAD POSITION FOR A LONG TIME AND ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF EDUCATION BUT AMONG YOUR SCHOOLMATES AND HERS THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHER GIRLS OF GOOD DESCENT WHO HAVE HAD ADVANTAGES HARDLY INFERIOR TO THOSE
6102-56178-0026 WELL SAID NORA I DON'T VALUE PEOPLE FOR THEIR ANCESTORS
6102-56178-0027 WHOSE PART IN MAKING HISTORY MAY HAVE BEEN ALMOST AS IMPORTANT IF LESS CONSPICUOUS THEN I WOULD RATHER SEE A GIRL OR A BOY WITHOUT FAMILY PRIDE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LET ME TELL YOU A STORY
6102-56178-0028 YEARS AGO A MURDER WAS COMMITTED BY A MEMBER OF A GOOD OLD FAMILY AND SOMETIME AFTERWARDS A LADY WHO BORE THE SAME NAME THOUGH SHE WAS NOT CLOSELY RELATED TO THE MURDERER WAS OUT SHOPPING IT SEEMED TO HER A CERTAIN CLERK WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY DEFERENTIAL
6102-56178-0029 NO MADAME I DO NOT
6102-56178-0030 INDEED HE ANSWERED YOU SURPRISE ME
6102-56178-0031 AS TO MAKE YOU CONTEMPTUOUS OF YOUR SCHOOLMATES I KNOW THAT MOTHER DEAR
6102-56178-0032 WITH A SMILE ABOUT THE VIRGINIA LADY OF WHOM I WAS READING THE OTHER DAY HER LITTLE NIECE WAS REMARKING WITH PRIDE THAT HER GRANDFATHER HAD BEEN THE SON OF A BARONET
6102-56178-0033 AUNT SMILED AT THE EXPRESSION OF RELIEF ON HER NIECE'S FACE ON HEARING THIS
6102-56178-0034 NORA REALIZED THAT SHE WAS FORTUNATE IN HAVING A MOTHER WHO WAS ALWAYS READY TO ADVISE HER IN THE SMALL MATTERS THAT SEEM SO IMPORTANT TO SCHOOLGIRLS
6102-56178-0035 THAT REALLY ARE OF CONSEQUENCE
6102-56178-0036 MISSUS BLAIR AND MISSUS BARLOW WERE ALSO READY TO ADVISE THEIR DAUGHTERS
6102-56178-0037 THE WILFUL BRENDA TOO WAS MORE APT TO SEEK HER MOTHER'S ADVICE AFTER SHE HAD DONE A CERTAIN THING
6102-56178-0038 EDITH WITH A RATHER PHLEGMATIC DISPOSITION SELDOM DID ANYTHING WRONG
6102-56178-0039 AS TO FRANCES THOSE WHO KNEW HER BEST REALIZED THAT HER FAMILY PRIDE HAD BEEN NURTURED AT HOME AND THAT HER UNFORTUNATE WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS WAS NOT WHOLLY HER OWN FAULT YET THAT NORA HAD BEEN ABLE TO INFLUENCE HER SOMEWHAT WAS PROVED BY A SLIGHT CHANGE IN FRANCES DEMEANOR TOWARDS OTHERS
6102-56178-0040 THE LATTER WAS EVEN KNOWN ONE DAY TO OFFER TO GO OUT TO RUTH ROBERTS HOUSE TO HELP HER FINISH A PIECE OF WORK FOR THE BAZAAR IN THOSE LAST DAYS TOO BEFORE THE EASTER VACATION THERE SEEMED TO BE AN UNUSUAL UNITY AMONG THE SCHOOLGIRLS
6102-56178-0041 THAT SHOWS SAID MISS SOUTH WHO HAD COME UP BEHIND BRENDA WHILE SHE WAS TALKING THAT IT IS NEVER WORTH WHILE TO BORROW TROUBLE ABOUT ANYTHING
6102-56178-0042 TO WHOM BRENDA HAD BEEN TALKING FOR MY OWN PART I AM NEVER SURPRISED OR DISAPPOINTED ABOUT ANYTHING FOR I NEVER EXPECT TOO MUCH BEFOREHAND
6102-56178-0043 THEN YOU ARE REALLY A PHILOSOPHER EDITH SAID MISS SOUTH SOME PERSONS TAKE ALMOST A LIFETIME TO LEARN THIS SIMPLE LESSON AND INDEED SOME PERSONS NEVER LEARN IT AT ALL
6102-56178-0044 AS THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE BAZAAR ADVANCED IT WAS VERY PLEASANT FOR JULIA TO FIND HERSELF COUNTED IN AMONG THE BAND OF WORKERS IT IS TRUE THAT SHE OFTEN HAD TO TAKE A SHARP WORD FROM BRENDA
6102-56178-0045 BUT THESE THINGS DID NOT DISTURB HER SHE HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO HER COUSIN'S LITTLE WAYS AND SHE REALIZED THAT HER BARK
6102-56178-0046 OH I SUPPOSE YOU ARE RIGHT BRENDA ACKNOWLEDGED WITH A SIGH BUT I SHOULD BE EVER SO MUCH BETTER PLEASED WITH A HOTEL IT WOULD SEEM SO MUCH MORE AS IF WE WERE GROWN UP I HOPE THAT THIS WON'T SEEM LIKE A
6102-56178-0047 YOU KNOW THAT EDITH ALWAYS HAD HER BIRTHDAY PARTIES IN THAT ROOM
