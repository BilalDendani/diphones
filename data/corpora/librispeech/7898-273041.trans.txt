7898-273041-0000 THE PASSENGERS IN THE SEVEN OAKS AND LUMBERTON STAGE SAT FACING ONE ANOTHER ON THE TWO BROAD SEATS MADEMOISELLE PICOLET HAD ESTABLISHED HERSELF IN ONE CORNER OF THE FORWARD SEAT RIDING WITH HER BACK TO THE DRIVER
7898-273041-0001 RUTH AND HELEN WERE SIDE BY SIDE UPON THE OTHER SEAT AND THIS NEWCOMER SLID QUICKLY IN BESIDE THEM AND SMILED A VERY BROAD AND FRIENDLY SMILE AT THE TWO CHUMS
7898-273041-0002 MAKE YOUR BARGAIN BEFORE YOU GET INTO THE ARK THAT'S WHAT WE CALL THIS STAGE OR HE SURELY WILL OVERCHARGE YOU
7898-273041-0003 SHE SPOKE TO THE FRENCH TEACHER SO CARELESSLY INDEED IN SO SCORNFUL A TONE THAT RUTH WAS STARTLED
7898-273041-0004 AND HER EYES SPARKLE IT WAS DOUBTLESS OF AN ADMONISHING NATURE BUT RUTH AND HELEN DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT OF COURSE YOU ARE THE TWO GIRLS WHOM WE EX THAT IS WHO WERE EXPECTED TO DAY THE GIRL ASKED THE CHUMS QUICKLY
7898-273041-0005 WE ARE GOING TO BRIARWOOD HALL SAID RUTH TIMIDLY
7898-273041-0006 THEIR NEW ACQUAINTANCE SAID WITH APPARENT FRANKNESS AND CORDIALITY I'M MARY COX I'M A JUNIOR THE SCHOOL IS DIVIDED INTO PRIMARY JUNIOR AND SENIOR OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY YOUNGER GIRLS THAN EITHER OF YOU AT BRIARWOOD BUT ALL NEWCOMERS ARE CALLED INFANTS
7898-273041-0007 MY FRIEND IS HELEN CAMERON AND MY NAME IS RUTH FIELDING
7898-273041-0008 BUT YOURS IS A DUET ROOM THAT'S NICE TOO WHEN YOU ARE ALREADY FRIENDS SHE SEEMED TO HAVE INFORMED HERSELF REGARDING THESE PARTICULAR NEWCOMERS EVEN IF SHE HAD MET THEM QUITE BY ACCIDENT HELEN WHO EVIDENTLY QUITE ADMIRED MARY COX
7898-273041-0009 NOW VENTURED TO SAY THAT SHE PRESUMED MOST OF THE GIRLS WERE ALREADY GATHERED FOR THE AUTUMN TERM THERE ARE A GOOD MANY ON HAND
7898-273041-0010 MISSUS TELLINGHAM IS VERY STRICT ABOUT THAT THOSE WHO ARRIVE AFTER THAT HAVE A DEMERIT TO WORK OFF AT THE START MARY COX EXPLAINED THE SYSTEM UNDER WHICH BRIARWOOD WAS CARRIED ON TOO WITH MUCH GOOD NATURE
7898-273041-0011 BUT ALL THE TIME SHE NEVER ADDRESSED THE FRENCH TEACHER NOR DID SHE PAY THE LEAST ATTENTION TO HER THE COOL WAY IN WHICH SHE CONDUCTED THE CONVERSATION COMMENTING UPON THE SCHOOL SYSTEM THE TEACHERS AND ALL OTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO MISS PICOLET
7898-273041-0012 MADE RUTH AT LEAST FEEL UNHAPPY IT WAS SO PLAIN THAT MARY COX IGNORED AND SLIGHTED THE LITTLE FOREIGN LADY BY INTENTION
7898-273041-0013 WE'LL SLIP OUT OF THE STAGE AT THE END OF CEDAR WALK IT'S FARTHER TO THE DORMITORIES THAT WAY BUT I FANCY THERE'LL BE FEW OF THE GIRLS THERE
7898-273041-0014 BUT I FANCY YOU GIRLS WOULD JUST AS LIEF ESCAPE THE WARM GREETING WE USUALLY GIVE TO THE ARRIVING INFANTS AND SHE LAUGHED RUTH AND HELEN WITH A VIVID REMEMBRANCE OF WHAT THEY HAD SEEN AT SEVEN OAKS COINCIDED WITH THIS SUGGESTION IT SEEMED VERY KIND OF A JUNIOR TO PUT HERSELF OUT FOR THEM
7898-273041-0015 LOTS OF THE GIRLS ESPECIALLY GIRLS OF OUR AGE COMING TO BRIARWOOD FOR THE FIRST TIME GET IN WITH THE WRONG CROWD
7898-273041-0016 NOW THE CHUMS COULD NOT HELP BEING A LITTLE FLATTERED BY THIS STATEMENT MARY COX WAS OLDER THAN RUTH AND HELEN AND THE LATTER WERE AT AN AGE
7898-273041-0017 I SHOULD SUPPOSE IN A SCHOOL LIKE BRIARWOOD RUTH SAID HESITATINGLY THAT ALL THE GIRLS ARE PRETTY NICE OH THEY ARE TO A DEGREE OH YES CRIED MARY COX
7898-273041-0018 BRIARWOOD IS VERY SELECT AND MISSUS TELLINGHAM IS VERY CAREFUL YOU MUST KNOW THAT MISS CAMERON SHE ADDED POINT BLANK TO HELEN OR YOUR FATHER WOULD NOT HAVE SENT YOU HERE HELEN FLUSHED AT THIS BOLDLY IMPLIED COMPLIMENT
7898-273041-0019 AND SHE WONDERED WHY THE JUNIOR HAD DONE SO
7898-273041-0020 OF COURSE WE ALL KNOW WHO YOUR FATHER IS MISS CAMERON
7898-273041-0021 AND THERE'S A GOOD DEAL OF RIVALRY AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH YEAR ESPECIALLY RIVALRY OVER WHAT QUERIED RUTH
7898-273041-0022 HELEN BECAME WONDERFULLY INTERESTED AT ONCE EVERYTHING PERTAINING TO THE LIFE BEFORE HER AT BRIARWOOD WAS BOUND TO INTEREST HELEN AND THE SUGGESTION OF SOCIETY IN THE WAY OF CLUBS AND ASSOCIATIONS APPEALED TO HER
7898-273041-0023 WHAT CLUBS ARE THERE SHE DEMANDED OF THE JUNIOR WHY THERE ARE SEVERAL ASSOCIATIONS IN THE SCHOOL
7898-273041-0024 ANYBODY CAN BELONG TO THAT WHO WISHES TO PLAY AND WE HAVE A GOOD SCHOOL TEAM WHICH OFTEN PLAYS TEAMS FROM OTHER SCHOOLS
7898-273041-0025 ARE THE UPEDES AND THE FUSSY CURLS SAID THEIR NEW FRIEND WHAT RIDICULOUS NAMES CRIED HELEN I SUPPOSE THEY MEAN SOMETHING THOUGH
7898-273041-0026 THE UPEDES ARE THE UP AND DOING CLUB
7898-273041-0027 WHAT DO THE LETTERS REALLY STAND FOR FORWARD CLUB I BELIEVE I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE FUSSY CURLS MARY SAID WITH THE SAME TONE AND AIR
7898-273041-0028 YES SAID MARY COX NODDING AND SEEMED TO HAVE FINISHED WITH THAT SUBJECT BUT HELEN WAS INTERESTED
7898-273041-0029 BOTH CLUBS ARE ANXIOUS TO GET MEMBERS MARY COX SAID BOTH ARE PUTTING OUT CONSIDERABLE EFFORT TO GAIN NEW MEMBERS
7898-273041-0030 WHAT ARE THE OBJECTS OF THE RIVAL CLUBS PUT IN RUTH QUIETLY I COULDN'T TELL YOU MUCH ABOUT THE FUSSY CURLS SAID MARY CARELESSLY NOT BEING ONE OF THEM I COULDN'T BE EXPECTED TO TAKE MUCH INTEREST IN THEIR OBJECTS
7898-273041-0031 NO SLOW COACHES ABOUT THE UPEDES WE'RE ALL ALIVE AND WIDE AWAKE
7898-273041-0032 BUT BEFORE THE DISCUSSION COULD BE CARRIED FARTHER MARY PUT HER HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW AND CALLED TO THE DRIVER
7898-273041-0033 HERE'S YOUR TEN CENTS MEANWHILE THE LITTLE FOREIGN LADY HAD SCARCELY MOVED SHE HAD TURNED HER FACE TOWARD THE OPEN WINDOW ALL THE TIME AND BEING VEILED THE GIRLS COULD NOT SEE WHETHER SHE WAS ASLEEP OR AWAKE SHE MADE NO MOVE TO GET OUT AT THIS POINT
7898-273041-0034 NOR DID SHE SEEM TO NOTICE THE GIRLS WHEN MARY FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COACH AND RUTH AND HELEN PICKED UP THEIR BAGS TO FOLLOW HER THE CHUMS SAW THAT THE STAGE HAD HALTED WHERE A SHADY WINDING PATH SEEMED TO LEAD UP A SLIGHT RISE THROUGH A PLANTATION OF CEDARS
7898-273041-0035 BUT THE SPOT WAS NOT LONELY SEVERAL GIRLS WERE WAITING HERE FOR THE COACH AND THEY GREETED MARY COX WHEN SHE JUMPED DOWN VOCIFEROUSLY WELL MARY COX I GUESS WE KNOW WHAT YOU'VE BEEN UP TO EXCLAIMED ONE WHO SEEMED OLDER THAN THE OTHER GIRLS IN WAITING
7898-273041-0036 DID YOU ROPE ANY INFANTS MARY CRIED SOMEBODY ELSE THE FOX NEVER TOOK ALL THAT LONG WALK FOR NOTHING DECLARED ANOTHER BUT MARY COX PAID HER RESPECTS TO THE FIRST SPEAKER ONLY BY SAYING
7898-273041-0037 YOU FUSSY CURLS HAD BETTER SET YOUR ALARM CLOCKS A LITTLE EARLIER RUTH AND HELEN WERE CLIMBING OUT OF THE OLD COACH NOW AND THE GIRL NAMED MADGE STEELE LOOKED THEM OVER SHARPLY PLEDGED ARE THEY SHE SAID TO MARY COX IN A LOW TONE
7898-273041-0038 RETURNED MISS COX WITH A MALICIOUS SMILE RUTH AND HELEN DID NOT DISTINCTLY HEAR THIS INTERCHANGE OF WORDS BETWEEN THEIR NEW FRIEND AND MADGE STEELE
7898-273041-0039 RUTH LIKED HER APPEARANCE MUCH MORE THAN SHE DID THAT OF MARY COX BUT THE LATTER STARTED AT ONCE INTO THE CEDAR PLANTATION UP A SERPENTINE WALK AND HELEN AND RUTH PERFORCE WENT WITH HER THE OTHER GIRLS STOOD ASIDE
7898-273041-0040 SOME OF THEM WHISPERING TOGETHER AND SMILING AT THE NEWCOMERS THE CHUMS COULD NOT HELP BUT FEEL STRANGE AND NERVOUS AND MARY COX'S FRIENDSHIP SEEMED OF VALUE TO THEM JUST THEN RUTH HOWEVER LOOKED BACK AT THE TALL GIRL WHOSE APPEARANCE HAD SO IMPRESSED HER
7898-273041-0041 OLD DOLLIVER DID EVERYTHING SLOWLY BUT RUTH FIELDING SAW A HAND BECKONING AT THE COACH WINDOW IT WAS THE HAND OF MISS PICOLET THE FRENCH TEACHER AND IT BECKONED MADGE STEELE THE LATTER YOUNG LADY RAN TO THE COACH AS IT LURCHED FORWARD ON ITS WAY
