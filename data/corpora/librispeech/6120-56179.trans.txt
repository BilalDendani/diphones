6120-56179-0000 AN EVENING'S FUN MISSUS BLAIR HAD SAID THAT ALL THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE BAZAAR MUST BE COMPLETED ON TUESDAY
6120-56179-0001 SHE KNEW THE WAYS OF GIRLS TOO WELL TO THINK THAT IT WOULD BE SAFE TO HAVE ANYTHING LEFT FOR WEDNESDAY MORNING THE FLOWER TABLE OF COURSE HAD TO BE ARRANGED ON THAT DAY AND SOME THINGS FOR THE REFRESHMENT TABLE
6120-56179-0002 BUT SO DEFINITE HAD SHE BEEN IN EXPRESSING HER WISHES THAT THE GIRLS FELT THAT IT WAS DUE HER FOR LENDING HER HOUSE TO PAY ALL DEFERENCE TO WHAT SHE SAID ON THE MONDAY THEREFORE AFTER EASTER
6120-56179-0003 THEY WENT TO WORK WITH A WILL TO GATHER IN THE PROMISED CONTRIBUTIONS THERE WERE NATURALLY SOME DISAPPOINTMENTS BUT ON THE WHOLE THE FANCY ARTICLES BESTOWED UPON THEM WERE NUMEROUS AND BEAUTIFUL AND MANY WERE THE OHS AND AHS
6120-56179-0004 FROM THE FOUR AND THEIR ASSISTANTS WHEN ON TUESDAY THEY FELL TO THE TASK OF OPENING THE PARCELS AND ARRANGING THEIR CONTENTS ON THE TABLES TUESDAY WAS RAINY AND AT DUSK GAVE LITTLE PROMISE OF A BRIGHT SKY FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY
6120-56179-0005 BRENDA WAS IN A TREMOR OF EXCITEMENT OH DEAR HOW DREADFUL IF TO MORROW SHOULD BE STORMY I AM SURE IT WILL BE AND WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH GREAT EMPHASIS ON THE SHALL
6120-56179-0006 SANG NORA WHILE EDITH PATTED BRENDA ON THE BACK AND SAID WELL WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO CHANGE THE WEATHER AND WE MIGHT AS WELL HOPE FOR THE BEST I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL COME EVEN IF IT RAINS
6120-56179-0007 AND PERHAPS THEY'LL BE GOOD AND BUY THREE TIMES AS MUCH AS THEY WOULD IN FINE WEATHER JUST THEN JULIA CAME IN WITH THE EVENING PAPER IN HER HAND SEE OR RATHER HEAR THE NEWS OLD PROBABILITY SAYS CLEAR AND FAIR WEDNESDAY
6120-56179-0008 MISSUS BLAIR SENT THIS PAPER UP FROM THE LIBRARY TO CHEER YOU THERE WAS A LARGE PATCH OF BLUE IN THE WEST WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN
6120-56179-0009 EXCLAIMED THE OTHERS DERISIVELY IN THE PLACE WHERE THE SUN SHOULD HAVE GONE DOWN SHE RESPONDED WITH A SMILE WHY HOW WELL THE ROOMS LOOK THERE WON'T BE A THING FOR THE BOYS TO DO THIS EVENING FOR PHILIP AND WILL HARDON
6120-56179-0010 AND ONE OR TWO OTHERS WERE TO COME IN THE EVENING TO SEE WHAT THEY COULD DO TO HELP AND IN VIEW OF THEIR COMING MISSUS BLAIR HAD INVITED THE GIRLS TO STAY TO DINNER OH NO THERE REALLY ISN'T A THING FOR THEM TO DO BUT PERHAPS WHEN THEY SEE HOW HARD WE HAVE WORKED
6120-56179-0011 THEY WILL MAKE UP THEIR MINDS TO SPEND ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY TO MORROW
6120-56179-0012 BOYS ARE NOT SO FOND OF SPENDING MONEY AT FAIRS I CAN TELL YOU THAT SAID NORA RATHER DECIDEDLY AND BESIDES MOST OF THEM ARE SO MUCH IN DEBT THAT THEY HAVEN'T ANYTHING TO SPEND OH
6120-56179-0013 WELL PHILIP'S FRIENDS ARE NOT LIKE THAT SAID BELLE RATHER SHARPLY
6120-56179-0014 SOME JUNIORS THAT I KNOW NEW YORK FELLOWS ARE COMING TO MORROW AND THEY WILL SPEND A LOT OF MONEY GRACIOUS EXCLAIMED BRENDA
6120-56179-0015 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MOST OF THESE THINGS ARE FOR GIRLS TO USE OH THEY CAN BUY THINGS FOR THEIR SISTERS AND COUSINS BESIDES BOYS LIKE PINCUSHIONS AND PICTURE FRAMES AND SOFA PILLOWS OH
6120-56179-0016 I AM SURE THAT WE SHALL HAVE NO TROUBLE GETTING THEM TO BUY ALL THAT THEY CAN AFFORD REPLIED BELLE POSITIVELY AS A MATTER OF FACT WHEN THE BOYS AFTER DINNER WERE USHERED INTO THE PRETTY LITTLE BALLROOM WHERE THE TABLES LADEN WITH FANCY GOODS STOOD
6120-56179-0017 THEY EXPRESSED GREAT INTEREST IN ALL THAT THEY SAW AND BEGAN TO MAKE BIDS FOR THE THINGS WHICH SEEMED TO THEM BEST WORTH HAVING LOOK OUT CRIED NORA OR WE MAY TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD WILL HARDON
6120-56179-0018 WELL WHY NOT HE ENQUIRED AS LONG AS IT IS TO BE IN A GOOD CAUSE OH NO INTERRUPTED THE PRACTICAL EDITH THAT WOULD NOT REALLY BE FAIR BESIDES
6120-56179-0019 EVERYBODY OUGHT TO HAVE AN EQUAL CHANCE AT THE BEGINNING OH HOW SILLY YOU ARE EDITH BROKE IN BRENDA
6120-56179-0020 COULD BE HERE AT THE SAME MINUTE IF ANY ONE WANTS TO BID ON ANYTHING TO NIGHT I SAY THAT IT IS PERFECTLY FAIR AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION IT WAS AT LAST DECIDED THAT ANY ONE WHO HAD A GREAT PREFERENCE FOR ANY SPECIAL THING
6120-56179-0021 MIGHT WRITE HIS NAME ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND HAVE IT PINNED TO THE OBJECT WITH THE LIMIT OF PRICE THAT HE WAS WILLING TO PAY THEN YOU MUST BE WILLING SAID BRENDA
6120-56179-0022 AND REFUSES TO BE CONTENTED WITH ANYTHING ELSE BUT IN THAT CASE WHAT ARE WE TO DO CRIED TWO OR THREE OF THE BOYS IN CHORUS
6120-56179-0023 IF YOU ONLY MAKE UP YOUR MINDS TO IT PERHAPS YOU'LL WANT ME TO BUY A BLUE SOFA PILLOW OR SOME OTHER YALE THING SIGHED WILL HARDON PERHAPS I SHALL BE DRIVEN TO TAKE THIS MOANED PHILIP
6120-56179-0024 HOLDING UP A LARGE DOLL DRESSED IN THE LONG EMBROIDERED ROBES OF A BABY ALL THE GIRLS LAUGHED EXCEPT EDITH WHO SELDOM SAW THE FUNNY SIDE OF THINGS AS QUICKLY AS THE OTHERS WELL YOU CAN SEE YOURSELVES BOYS SHE SAID IN A DETERMINED TONE
6120-56179-0025 THAT YOU OUGHT TO BE GLAD TO BUY WHATEVER IS LEFT OVER FOR YOU PROBABLY WON'T GET IN UNTIL TOWARD EVENING YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND SOME ONE TO GIVE THE THINGS TO THAT YOU BUY THIS DOLL ASKED PHILIP HOLDING IT RATHER CLUMSILY ON HIS ARM WHY OF COURSE SAID EDITH
6120-56179-0026 WE KNOW SEVERAL CHILDREN WHO WOULD BE DELIGHTED WITH IT AT CHRISTMAS NO THANK YOU SISTER EDITH RESPONDED PHILIP I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND MY HARD EARNED ALLOWANCE IN PRESENTS FOR CHILDREN
6120-56179-0027 IF YOU MAKE ME BUY THIS DOLL OUT IT GOES TO A CERTAIN ROOM IN ONE OF THE COLLEGE BUILDINGS TO BECOME A CHERISHED DECORATION AND WAVING THE DOLL DRAMATICALLY IN THE AIR I SHALL DEFY ANY PROCTOR OR COLLEGE AUTHORITY TO TEAR IT AWAY FROM ME
6120-56179-0028 THEN I HOPE HE MAY GET IT MURMURED WILL HARDON TO RUTH ROBERTS I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYTHING THAT WOULD AMUSE THE FELLOWS MORE
6120-56179-0029 A REGULAR RECEPTION BUT YOU KNOW I'M IN EARNEST ABOUT THAT PILLOW HE ADDED FOR HE KNEW AND RUTH KNEW THAT HE KNEW THAT THE DOWN PILLOW WITH ITS RICH CRIMSON COVER EMBROIDERED WITH A LARGE H WAS THE WORK OF HER SKILFUL FINGERS
6120-56179-0030 RUTH AND WILL HAD MET SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THE BALL GAME AND ALTHOUGH THE FOUR HAD NOT YET DISCOVERED IT THESE TWO YOUNG PERSONS HAD BEGUN TO TAKE CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN EACH OTHER YOU WOULDN'T PAY A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR IT QUERIED RUTH
6120-56179-0031 AND BESIDES IT WOULD BE WORTH MUCH MORE TO ME THIS WAS NOT ENTIRELY AN IDLE BOAST THIS READINESS TO SPEND A LARGE SUM OF MONEY FOR A SMALL THING ON THE PART OF WILL
6120-56179-0032 ALTHOUGH VERY QUIET IN HIS WAY OF LIVING AND IN HIS GENERAL CONVERSATION HE HAD A LARGER INCOME THAN MANY IN HIS SET
6120-56179-0033 AND THOUGH HE NATURALLY SPENT MORE THAN THE AVERAGE UNDERGRADUATE
6120-56179-0034 HE STILL HAD ENOUGH TO SPEND ON OTHERS AND MORE THAN ONE OF HIS LESS FORTUNATE CLASSMATES HAD REASON TO THANK HIM FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE FOR HIM NO ONE KNEW OF HIS LIBERALITY EXCEPT THOSE WHOM HE HELPED FOR HE HAD NOT THE LEAST WISH TO POSE AS A BENEFACTOR
6120-56179-0035 NOW RUTH WHILE PLEASED AT HIS WISH FOR THE CUSHION HAD NO IDEA THAT HE WOULD IF NECESSARY PAY A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR IT IF YOU REALLY WISH TO HAVE IT I'LL TRY TO SECURE IT FOR YOU SHE SAID I AM SURE THERE WON'T BE ANY TROUBLE
6120-56179-0036 ALTHOUGH I SUPPOSE THAT IT CAN'T BE LAID ASIDE TO NIGHT AS LONG AS EDITH FEELS AS SHE DOES VERY WELL ANSWERED WILL I'LL TRUST TO YOU FOR I REALLY DO WANT IT VERY MUCH COME CRIED BRENDA RUSHING UP TO THEM YOU ARE NOT DOING A THING YOU TWO
6120-56179-0037 WELL THE REST OF YOU SEEMED SO BUSY THAT WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD ONLY BE IN THE WAY SAID WILL WITH THE GLIBNESS THAT IS ALMOST SECOND NATURE WITH YOUTHS OF HIS AGE BUT WE'RE READY TO WORK NOW AND THEY WENT ACROSS THE ROOM TO THE SURPRISE TABLE WHERE HALF A DOZEN OF THEIR FRIENDS WERE BUSY
6120-56179-0038 THE SURPRISE TABLE HAD BEEN AN IDEA OF BELLE'S AND WAS A RATHER AGREEABLE CHANGE FROM THE USUAL GRAB BAG ALL KINDS OF LITTLE THINGS TOYS NOVELTIES LIKE THOSE USED AS GERMAN FAVORS SMALL BOOKS AND PHOTOGRAPHS
6120-56179-0039 WERE NEATLY DONE UP IN BRIGHT TISSUE PAPER WRAPPINGS AND TIED WITH SILK RIBBONS THEY WERE HEAPED ON A LARGE TABLE AND PURCHASERS WERE PERMITTED TO BUY EACH LITTLE PACKAGE AT THEIR OWN PRICE PROVIDED AT LEAST ACCORDING TO A SIGN PLACED ABOVE THE TABLE THAT NO BID SHOULD BE
6120-56179-0040 FOR LESS THAN FIFTEEN CENTS NORA WAS TO HAVE CHARGE OF THIS TABLE AND SHE EXPECTED TO HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF FUN OUT OF THE MISFITS BETWEEN THE PURCHASERS AND THE PARCELS ALTOGETHER THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE BAZAAR HAD MOVED ALONG MUCH MORE SMOOTHLY THAN ANY ONE HAD EXPECTED
6120-56179-0041 IT IS TRUE THAT THE VARIOUS MOTHERS OF THE GIRLS COMPRISING THE FOUR HAD SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE GLAD ENOUGH WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER BECAUSE FOR A FORTNIGHT IT HAD BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE GIRLS TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE YET EACH OF THESE MOTHERS
6120-56179-0042 SAW A COMPENSATION FOR THE EXCITEMENT OF THIS LAST WEEK OR TWO IN THE FACT THAT HER DAUGHTER HAD SHOWN MORE PERSEVERANCE THAN SHE HAD GIVEN HER CREDIT FOR MISSUS BARLOW WAS ESPECIALLY PLEASED WITH THE GOOD SPIRIT THAT HER NIECE JULIA HAD SHOWN
6120-56179-0043 FOR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO EASY AND NATURAL FOR HER AT THE LAST TO DISPLAY A LITTLE PETTISHNESS IN THE WAY OF A REFUSAL TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE BAZAAR IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN INVITED TO JOIN THE FOUR AT THEIR WEEKLY MEETINGS FOR WORK
6120-56179-0044 BUT JULIA WAS NOT ONE TO SHOW THIS KIND OF RESENTMENT AND SINCE SHE HAD BECOME INTERESTED IN MANUEL SHE WAS ONLY TOO GLAD TO HELP THE BAZAAR THAT WAS TO BENEFIT HIM AT HER AUNT'S SUGGESTION SHE HAD MADE IT HER SPECIAL DUTY
6120-56179-0045 TO COLLECT FLOWERS AND PLANTS FOR THE FLOWER TABLE AND ARMED WITH NOTES OF INTRODUCTION FROM MISSUS BARLOW SHE HAD GONE TO MANY A SUPPOSEDLY CLOSE PERSON TO ASK FOR SOME SMALL CONTRIBUTION TO THE FLOWER TABLE HER SUCCESS HAD BEEN ALTOGETHER REMARKABLE
6120-56179-0046 AND IN ADDITION TO THE CUT FLOWERS THAT WERE TO ARRIVE ON WEDNESDAY A GREAT MANY BEAUTIFUL POTTED PLANTS AND VINES HAD BEEN SENT IN FROM VARIOUS CONSERVATORIES FOR GENERAL DECORATIONS THE ONLY REAL WORK FOR THE BOYS WHO HAD COME TO ASSIST
6120-56179-0047 OR NEAR THE FLOWER TABLE WHERE THEY WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE THE WORK DID NOT OF COURSE PROCEED VERY RAPIDLY FOR EVERY ONE IN THE GROUP OF FIFTEEN OR MORE HAD TO GIVE AN OPINION ON EVERYTHING AND A UNANIMOUS OPINION AS TO WHAT LOOKED BEST IN ANY PARTICULAR CASE WAS NATURALLY IMPOSSIBLE
6120-56179-0048 THE LARGE ROOM WAS SO HANDSOME AS TO REQUIRE COMPARATIVELY LITTLE DECORATION THE LONG MIRRORS WITH WHICH EVERY SIDE WAS PANELED FORMED A COMPLETE DECORATION IN THEMSELVES AND ADDED TO THE GENERAL EFFECTIVENESS AS BRENDA SAID BY MAKING THE TABLES LOOK DOUBLE
6120-56179-0049 NOW IF THE BOYS DID NOT FIND A GREAT DEAL OF WORK TO DO THEY WERE VERY OUTSPOKEN IN THEIR ADMIRATION FOR ALL THAT HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY THE GIRLS WELL IF OTHER PEOPLE WILL ONLY BE AS MUCH IMPRESSED AS YOU ARE AND WILL OPEN THEIR PURSES ACCORDINGLY
6120-56179-0050 WE SHALL HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF SAID NORA AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL ALL COME BACK AND BUY EVERYTHING THAT IS LEFT OVER BY TO MORROW EVENING CAN'T WE HAVE FIRST CHOICE OF ANYTHING QUERIED TOM HURST A MISCHIEF LOVING FRIEND OF PHILIP'S WHOM SOME OF THE GIRLS DISTRUSTED A LITTLE
6120-56179-0051 NO ANSWERED NORA STERNLY YOU MUST NOT BE SO SELFISH THERE MAY BE OLD LADIES WHO WILL WANT DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT ANY OLD LADY WILL WANT THAT TOBACCO POUCH ASKED TOM WITH A MOST INNOCENT EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE SHE MIGHT
6120-56179-0052 ANSWERED NORA WITH A VERY DIGNIFIED MANNER SHE MIGHT IF SHE HAD A SON WHO WAS FOND OF SMOKING AT ANY RATE SHE OUGHT TO HAVE FIRST CHOICE WELL THEN REPLIED TOM I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I SHALL RETURN
6120-56179-0053 THAT ENCOURAGES OLD LADIES TO BUY TOBACCO POUCHES THEY'RE MORE HARMLESS FOR OLD LADIES THAN FOR HARVARD UNDERGRADUATES SAID ANOTHER OF THE GIRLS SERIOUSLY WHEREAT TWO OR THREE OF THE BOYS PULLED CIGARETTE CASES OUT OF THEIR POCKETS AND SAID
6120-56179-0054 WOULDN'T YOU RATHER HAVE US USE TOBACCO POUCHES THAN SMOKE THESE UNWHOLESOME CIGARETTES YOU SHOULDN'T USE TOBACCO AT ALL CRIED EDITH IN A PLAINTIVE TONE AT YOUR AGE PHILIP YOU KNOW HOW MAMMA FEELS ABOUT IT DON'T BE A GOOSE EDITH RETORTED PHILIP
6120-56179-0055 UNLESS YOU WANT US TO STAY AWAY TO MORROW ANYWAY IT'S TIME WE STARTED FOR CAMBRIDGE WE'RE NOT USED TO LATE HOURS AT THIS THE REST OF THE BOYS LAUGHED RATHER MORE LOUDLY THAN THE OCCASION SEEMED TO WARRANT BUT WITH A RETURN OF GOOD MANNERS
6120-56179-0056 THEY BADE THE GIRLS GOOD BYE AND PROMISED MISSUS BLAIR WHO HAD RETURNED TO THE ROOM THAT THEY WOULD CERTAINLY DROP IN SOME TIME ON WEDNESDAY DON'T FORGET YOUR PROMISE TO ME SAID WILL HARDON IN AN UNDERTONE AS HE SHOOK HANDS WITH RUTH AND RUTH PROMISED NOT TO FORGET
6120-56179-0057 RUTH AND ONE OTHER GIRL WERE TO SPEND THE NIGHT WITH JULIA AND BRENDA SO AS TO BE READY EARLY IN THE MORNING AND THE REST OF THE ASSISTANTS STARTED OFF IN A LARGE GROUP ATTENDED BY ONE OF MISSUS BLAIR'S SERVANTS FOR NONE OF THEM HAD VERY FAR TO WALK
6120-56179-0058 IT CERTAINLY DOES LOOK AS IF IT MIGHT CLEAR UP SAID BELLE TO NORA AS THEY WALKED ALONG YES INDEED ANSWERED NORA
