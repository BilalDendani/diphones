4549-39615-0000 CHAPTER ONE THE LETTER TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH OF MAY IN THE YEAR SIXTEEN SIXTY AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN THE SUN ALREADY HIGH IN THE HEAVENS WAS FAST ABSORBING THE DEW FROM THE RAMPARTS OF THE CASTLE OF BLOIS
4549-39615-0001 WITHOUT PRODUCING ANY OTHER EFFECT UPON THE PASSENGERS OF THE QUAY BEYOND A FIRST MOVEMENT OF THE HAND TO THE HEAD AS A SALUTE AND A SECOND MOVEMENT OF THE TONGUE TO EXPRESS IN THE PUREST FRENCH THEN SPOKEN IN FRANCE THERE IS MONSIEUR RETURNING FROM HUNTING AND THAT WAS ALL
4549-39615-0002 WHILST HOWEVER THE HORSES WERE CLIMBING THE STEEP ACCLIVITY WHICH LEADS FROM THE RIVER TO THE CASTLE SEVERAL SHOP BOYS APPROACHED THE LAST HORSE FROM WHOSE SADDLE BOW A NUMBER OF BIRDS WERE SUSPENDED BY THE BEAK
4549-39615-0003 ON SEEING THIS THE INQUISITIVE YOUTHS MANIFESTED WITH RUSTIC FREEDOM THEIR CONTEMPT FOR SUCH PALTRY SPORT
4549-39615-0004 THEY RETURNED TO THEIR OCCUPATIONS ONE ONLY OF THE CURIOUS PARTY A STOUT STUBBY CHEERFUL LAD HAVING DEMANDED HOW IT WAS THAT MONSIEUR WHO FROM HIS GREAT REVENUES HAD IT IN HIS POWER TO AMUSE HIMSELF SO MUCH BETTER
4549-39615-0005 COULD BE SATISFIED WITH SUCH MEAN DIVERSIONS DO YOU NOT KNOW ONE OF THE STANDERS BY REPLIED THAT MONSIEUR'S PRINCIPAL AMUSEMENT IS TO WEARY HIMSELF THE LIGHT HEARTED BOY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WITH A GESTURE WHICH SAID AS CLEAR AS DAY
4549-39615-0006 IN THAT CASE I WOULD RATHER BE PLAIN JACK THAN A PRINCE AND ALL RESUMED THEIR LABORS IN THE MEANWHILE MONSIEUR CONTINUED HIS ROUTE WITH AN AIR AT ONCE SO MELANCHOLY AND SO MAJESTIC
4549-39615-0007 BUT THE GOOD CITIZENS OF BLOIS COULD NOT PARDON MONSIEUR FOR HAVING CHOSEN THEIR GAY CITY FOR AN ABODE IN WHICH TO INDULGE MELANCHOLY AT HIS EASE
4549-39615-0008 THEY STOLE AWAY GAPING OR DREW BACK THEIR HEADS INTO THE INTERIOR OF THEIR DWELLINGS TO ESCAPE THE SOPORIFIC INFLUENCE OF THAT LONG PALE FACE OF THOSE WATERY EYES AND THAT LANGUID ADDRESS
4549-39615-0009 SO THAT THE WORTHY PRINCE WAS ALMOST CERTAIN TO FIND THE STREETS DESERTED WHENEVER HE CHANCED TO PASS THROUGH THEM NOW ON THE PART OF THE CITIZENS OF BLOIS THIS WAS A CULPABLE PIECE OF DISRESPECT FOR MONSIEUR WAS AFTER THE KING NAY EVEN PERHAPS BEFORE THE KING
4549-39615-0010 IT WAS NOT THEN OR AT LEAST IT OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN A TRIFLING SOURCE OF PRIDE FOR THE CITY OF BLOIS
4549-39615-0011 AND HELD HIS COURT IN THE ANCIENT CASTLE OF THE STATES BUT IT WAS THE DESTINY OF THIS GREAT PRINCE TO EXCITE THE ATTENTION AND ADMIRATION OF THE PUBLIC IN A VERY MODIFIED DEGREE WHEREVER HE MIGHT BE MONSIEUR HAD FALLEN INTO THIS SITUATION BY HABIT
4549-39615-0012 IT WAS NOT PERHAPS THIS WHICH GAVE HIM THAT AIR OF LISTLESSNESS MONSIEUR HAD ALREADY BEEN TOLERABLY BUSY IN THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE A MAN CANNOT ALLOW THE HEADS OF A DOZEN OF HIS BEST FRIENDS TO BE CUT OFF WITHOUT FEELING A LITTLE EXCITEMENT
4549-39615-0013 AND AS SINCE THE ACCESSION OF MAZARIN TO POWER NO HEADS HAD BEEN CUT OFF MONSIEUR'S OCCUPATION WAS GONE AND HIS MORALE SUFFERED FROM IT THE LIFE OF THE POOR PRINCE WAS THEN VERY DULL AFTER HIS LITTLE MORNING HAWKING PARTY ON THE BANKS OF THE BEUVRON
4549-39615-0014 OR IN THE WOODS OF CHEVERNY MONSIEUR CROSSED THE LOIRE WENT TO BREAKFAST AT CHAMBORD WITH OR WITHOUT AN APPETITE AND THE CITY OF BLOIS HEARD NO MORE OF ITS SOVEREIGN LORD AND MASTER TILL THE NEXT HAWKING DAY
4549-39615-0015 MONSIEUR RODE A LITTLE STEADY PACED HORSE EQUIPPED WITH A LARGE SADDLE OF RED FLEMISH VELVET WITH STIRRUPS IN THE SHAPE OF BUSKINS THE HORSE WAS OF A BAY COLOR MONSIEUR'S POURPOINT OF CRIMSON VELVET CORRESPONDED WITH THE CLOAK OF THE SAME SHADE
4549-39615-0016 AND THE HORSE'S EQUIPMENT AND IT WAS ONLY BY THIS RED APPEARANCE OF THE WHOLE THAT THE PRINCE COULD BE KNOWN FROM HIS TWO COMPANIONS THE ONE DRESSED IN VIOLET THE OTHER IN GREEN HE ON THE LEFT IN VIOLET WAS HIS EQUERRY HE ON THE RIGHT IN GREEN WAS THE GRAND VENEUR
4549-39615-0017 ONE OF THE PAGES CARRIED TWO GERFALCONS UPON A PERCH THE OTHER A HUNTING HORN WHICH HE BLEW WITH A CARELESS NOTE AT TWENTY PACES FROM THE CASTLE EVERY ONE ABOUT THIS LISTLESS PRINCE DID WHAT HE HAD TO LISTLESSLY
4549-39615-0018 AT THIS SIGNAL EIGHT GUARDS WHO WERE LOUNGING IN THE SUN IN THE SQUARE COURT RAN TO THEIR HALBERTS AND MONSIEUR MADE HIS SOLEMN ENTRY INTO THE CASTLE WHEN HE HAD DISAPPEARED UNDER THE SHADES OF THE PORCH THREE OR FOUR IDLERS WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE CAVALCADE TO THE CASTLE
4549-39615-0019 AFTER POINTING OUT THE SUSPENDED BIRDS TO EACH OTHER DISPERSED WITH COMMENTS UPON WHAT THEY SAW AND WHEN THEY WERE GONE THE STREET THE PALACE AND THE COURT ALL REMAINED DESERTED ALIKE MONSIEUR DISMOUNTED WITHOUT SPEAKING A WORD WENT STRAIGHT TO HIS APARTMENTS WHERE HIS VALET CHANGED HIS DRESS
4549-39615-0020 AND AS MADAME HAD NOT YET SENT ORDERS RESPECTING BREAKFAST MONSIEUR STRETCHED HIMSELF UPON A CHAISE LONGUE AND WAS SOON AS FAST ASLEEP AS IF IT HAD BEEN ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT THE EIGHT GUARDS WHO CONCLUDED THEIR SERVICE FOR THE DAY WAS OVER
4549-39615-0021 LAID THEMSELVES DOWN VERY COMFORTABLY IN THE SUN UPON SOME STONE BENCHES THE GROOMS DISAPPEARED WITH THEIR HORSES INTO THE STABLES AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW JOYOUS BIRDS STARTLING EACH OTHER WITH THEIR SHARP CHIRPING IN THE TUFTED SHRUBBERIES
4549-39615-0022 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THOUGHT THAT THE WHOLE CASTLE WAS AS SOUNDLY ASLEEP AS MONSIEUR WAS ALL AT ONCE IN THE MIDST OF THIS DELICIOUS SILENCE THERE RESOUNDED A CLEAR RINGING LAUGH WHICH CAUSED SEVERAL OF THE HALBERDIERS IN THE ENJOYMENT OF THEIR SIESTA
4549-39615-0023 TO OPEN AT LEAST ONE EYE THIS BURST OF LAUGHTER PROCEEDED FROM A WINDOW OF THE CASTLE VISITED AT THIS MOMENT BY THE SUN
4549-39615-0024 THE LITTLE BALCONY OF WROUGHT IRON WHICH ADVANCED IN FRONT OF THIS WINDOW WAS FURNISHED WITH A POT OF RED GILLIFLOWERS ANOTHER POT OF PRIMROSES AND AN EARLY ROSE TREE THE FOLIAGE OF WHICH BEAUTIFULLY GREEN WAS VARIEGATED WITH NUMEROUS RED SPECKS ANNOUNCING FUTURE ROSES
4549-39615-0025 COVERED WITH AN OLD LARGE FLOWERED HAARLEM TAPESTRY IN THE CENTER OF THIS TABLE WAS A LONG NECKED STONE BOTTLE IN WHICH WERE IRISES AND LILIES OF THE VALLEY AT EACH END OF THIS TABLE WAS A YOUNG GIRL
4549-39615-0026 THE POSITION OF THESE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE WAS SINGULAR THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR TWO BOARDERS ESCAPED FROM A CONVENT ONE OF THEM WITH BOTH ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND A PEN IN HER HAND WAS TRACING CHARACTERS UPON A SHEET OF FINE DUTCH PAPER
4549-39615-0027 THE OTHER KNEELING UPON A CHAIR WHICH ALLOWED HER TO ADVANCE HER HEAD AND BUST OVER THE BACK OF IT TO THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE WAS WATCHING HER COMPANION AS SHE WROTE OR RATHER HESITATED TO WRITE
4549-39615-0028 THENCE THE THOUSAND CRIES THE THOUSAND RAILLERIES THE THOUSAND LAUGHS ONE OF WHICH MORE BRILLIANT THAN THE REST HAD STARTLED THE BIRDS IN THE GARDENS AND DISTURBED THE SLUMBERS OF MONSIEUR'S GUARDS WE ARE TAKING PORTRAITS NOW
4549-39615-0029 WE SHALL BE ALLOWED THEREFORE WE HOPE TO SKETCH THE TWO LAST OF THIS CHAPTER THE ONE WHO WAS LEANING IN THE CHAIR THAT IS TO SAY THE JOYOUS LAUGHING ONE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF FROM EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY
4549-39615-0030 WITH BROWN COMPLEXION AND BROWN HAIR SPLENDID FROM EYES WHICH SPARKLED BENEATH STRONGLY MARKED BROWS AND PARTICULARLY FROM HER TEETH WHICH SEEMED TO SHINE LIKE PEARLS BETWEEN HER RED CORAL LIPS HER EVERY MOVEMENT SEEMED THE ACCENT OF A SUNNY NATURE
4549-39615-0031 SHE DID NOT WALK SHE BOUNDED THE OTHER SHE WHO WAS WRITING LOOKED AT HER TURBULENT COMPANION WITH AN EYE AS LIMPID AS PURE AND AS BLUE AS THE AZURE OF THE DAY HER HAIR OF A SHADED FAIRNESS ARRANGED WITH EXQUISITE TASTE
4549-39615-0032 FELL IN SILKY CURLS OVER HER LOVELY MANTLING CHEEKS SHE PASSED ACROSS THE PAPER A DELICATE HAND WHOSE THINNESS ANNOUNCED HER EXTREME YOUTH AT EACH BURST OF LAUGHTER THAT PROCEEDED FROM HER FRIEND SHE RAISED AS IF ANNOYED
4549-39615-0033 HER WHITE SHOULDERS IN A POETICAL AND MILD MANNER BUT THEY WERE WANTING IN THAT RICHFULNESS OF MOLD THAT WAS LIKEWISE TO BE WISHED IN HER ARMS AND HANDS MONTALAIS MONTALAIS SAID SHE AT LENGTH IN A VOICE SOFT AND CARESSING AS A MELODY
4549-39615-0034 YOU LAUGH TOO LOUD YOU LAUGH LIKE A MAN YOU WILL NOT ONLY DRAW THE ATTENTION OF MESSIEURS THE GUARDS BUT YOU WILL NOT HEAR MADAME'S BELL WHEN MADAME RINGS THIS ADMONITION NEITHER MADE THE YOUNG GIRL CALLED MONTALAIS CEASE TO LAUGH NOR GESTICULATE
4549-39615-0035 SHE ONLY REPLIED LOUISE YOU DO NOT SPEAK AS YOU THINK MY DEAR YOU KNOW THAT MESSIEURS THE GUARDS AS YOU CALL THEM HAVE ONLY JUST COMMENCED THEIR SLEEP AND THAT A CANNON WOULD NOT WAKEN THEM YOU KNOW THAT MADAME'S BELL CAN BE HEARD AT THE BRIDGE OF BLOIS
4549-39615-0036 AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY I SHALL HEAR IT WHEN MY SERVICES ARE REQUIRED BY MADAME WHAT ANNOYS YOU MY CHILD IS THAT I LAUGH WHILE YOU ARE WRITING AND WHAT YOU ARE AFRAID OF IS THAT MADAME DE SAINT REMY YOUR MOTHER SHOULD COME UP HERE AS SHE DOES SOMETIMES WHEN WE LAUGH TOO LOUD
4549-39615-0037 THAT SHE SHOULD SURPRISE US AND THAT SHE SHOULD SEE THAT ENORMOUS SHEET OF PAPER UPON WHICH IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR YOU HAVE ONLY TRACED THE WORDS MONSIEUR RAOUL
4549-39615-0038 SAY AND MONTALAIS REDOUBLED HER LAUGHTER AND NOISY PROVOCATIONS THE FAIR GIRL AT LENGTH BECAME QUITE ANGRY SHE TORE THE SHEET OF PAPER ON WHICH IN FACT THE WORDS MONSIEUR RAOUL WERE WRITTEN IN GOOD CHARACTERS
4549-39615-0039 THERE THERE SAID MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS THERE IS OUR LITTLE LAMB OUR GENTLE DOVE ANGRY
4549-39615-0040 BESIDES WHAT CAN BE MORE PERMISSIBLE THAN TO WRITE TO AN OLD FRIEND OF TWELVE YEARS STANDING PARTICULARLY WHEN THE LETTER BEGINS WITH THE WORDS MONSIEUR RAOUL IT IS ALL VERY WELL I WILL NOT WRITE TO HIM AT ALL SAID THE YOUNG GIRL AH AH
4549-39615-0041 IN GOOD SOOTH MONTALAIS IS PROPERLY PUNISHED CRIED THE JEERING BRUNETTE STILL LAUGHING COME COME LET US TRY ANOTHER SHEET OF PAPER AND FINISH OUR DISPATCH OFF HAND GOOD THERE IS THE BELL RINGING NOW
4549-39615-0042 BY MY FAITH SO MUCH THE WORSE MADAME MUST WAIT OR ELSE DO WITHOUT HER FIRST MAID OF HONOR THIS MORNING A BELL IN FACT DID RING IT ANNOUNCED THAT MADAME HAD FINISHED HER TOILETTE AND WAITED FOR MONSIEUR TO GIVE HER HIS HAND
4549-39615-0043 AND CONDUCT HER FROM THE SALON TO THE REFECTORY THIS FORMALITY BEING ACCOMPLISHED WITH GREAT CEREMONY THE HUSBAND AND WIFE BREAKFASTED AND THEN SEPARATED TILL THE HOUR OF DINNER INVARIABLY FIXED AT TWO O'CLOCK
4549-39615-0044 THE SOUND OF THIS BELL CAUSED A DOOR TO BE OPENED IN THE OFFICES ON THE LEFT HAND OF THE COURT FROM WHICH FILED TWO MAITRES D'HOTEL FOLLOWED BY EIGHT SCULLIONS BEARING A KIND OF HAND BARROW LOADED WITH DISHES UNDER SILVER COVERS
4549-39615-0045 HE EVEN CARRIED HIS KINDNESS SO FAR AS TO PLACE THE HALBERT WHICH STOOD AGAINST THE WALL IN THE HANDS OF THE MAN STUPID WITH SLEEP AFTER WHICH THE SOLDIER WITHOUT EXPLANATION ESCORTED THE VIANDE OF MONSIEUR TO THE REFECTORY PRECEDED BY A PAGE AND THE TWO MAITRES D'HOTEL
4549-39615-0046 WHEREVER THE VIANDE PASSED THE SOLDIERS PORTED ARMS MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS AND HER COMPANION HAD WATCHED FROM THEIR WINDOW THE DETAILS OF THIS CEREMONY
4549-39615-0047 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY WELL ACCUSTOMED BUT THEY DID NOT LOOK SO MUCH FROM CURIOSITY AS TO BE ASSURED THEY SHOULD NOT BE DISTURBED SO GUARDS SCULLIONS MAITRES D'HOTEL AND PAGES HAVING PASSED THEY RESUMED THEIR PLACES AT THE TABLE
4549-39615-0048 AND THE SUN WHICH THROUGH THE WINDOW FRAME HAD FOR AN INSTANT FALLEN UPON THOSE TWO CHARMING COUNTENANCES NOW ONLY SHED ITS LIGHT UPON THE GILLIFLOWERS PRIMROSES AND ROSE TREE
4549-39615-0049 SAID MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS TAKING HER PLACE AGAIN MADAME WILL BREAKFAST VERY WELL WITHOUT ME OH MONTALAIS YOU WILL BE PUNISHED
4549-39615-0050 THAT IS JUST THE WAY IN WHICH I WISH TO BE PUNISHED TO GO OUT IN THE GRAND COACH PERCHED UPON A DOORSTEP TO TURN TO THE LEFT TWIST ROUND TO THE RIGHT OVER ROADS FULL OF RUTS WHERE WE CANNOT EXCEED A LEAGUE IN TWO HOURS
4549-39615-0051 SO THAT MADAME NEVER FAILS TO SAY COULD ONE BELIEVE IT POSSIBLE THAT MARY DE MEDICI SHOULD HAVE ESCAPED FROM THAT WINDOW FORTY SEVEN FEET HIGH THE MOTHER OF TWO PRINCES AND THREE PRINCESSES
