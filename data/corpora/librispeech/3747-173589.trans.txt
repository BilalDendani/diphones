3747-173589-0083 THEY COUNTED THE LEAGUES OF BARREN OCEAN THAT STILL STRETCHED BEFORE AND GAZED ON EACH OTHER WITH HAGGARD WOLFISH EYES TILL A WHISPER PASSED FROM MAN TO MAN THAT ONE BY HIS DEATH MIGHT RANSOM ALL THE REST
3747-173589-0084 THE LOT WAS CAST AND IT FELL ON LA CHORE THE SAME WRETCHED MAN WHOM ALBERT HAD DOOMED TO STARVATION ON A LONELY ISLAND
