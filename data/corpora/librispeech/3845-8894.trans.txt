3845-8894-0000 THE ENCOUNTER WITH THE CARRIAGES HAVING SPRUNG UPON WINTERBORNE'S MIND THE IMAGE OF MISSUS CHARMOND HIS THOUGHTS BY A NATURAL CHANNEL WENT FROM HER TO THE FACT THAT SEVERAL COTTAGES AND OTHER HOUSES IN THE TWO HINTOCKS NOW HIS OWN WOULD FALL INTO HER POSSESSION IN THE EVENT OF SOUTH'S DEATH
3845-8894-0001 HE MARVELLED WHAT PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IN THE PAST TO INVENT SUCH PRECARIOUS TENURES AS THESE STILL MORE WHAT COULD HAVE INDUCED HIS ANCESTORS AT HINTOCK AND OTHER VILLAGE PEOPLE TO EXCHANGE THEIR OLD COPYHOLDS FOR LIFE LEASES
3845-8894-0002 BUT HAVING NATURALLY SUCCEEDED TO THESE PROPERTIES THROUGH HIS FATHER
3845-8894-0003 AFTER BREAKFAST STILL MUSING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES HE WENT UPSTAIRS TURNED OVER HIS BED AND DREW OUT A FLAT CANVAS BAG WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE MATTRESS AND THE SACKING IN THIS HE KEPT HIS LEASES WHICH HAD REMAINED THERE UNOPENED EVER SINCE HIS FATHER'S DEATH
3845-8894-0004 IT WAS THE USUAL HIDING PLACE AMONG RURAL LIFEHOLDERS FOR SUCH DOCUMENTS WINTERBORNE SAT DOWN ON THE BED AND LOOKED THEM OVER THEY WERE ORDINARY LEASES FOR THREE LIVES WHICH A MEMBER OF THE SOUTH FAMILY SOME FIFTY YEARS BEFORE THIS TIME
3845-8894-0005 IT WAS TO THE EFFECT THAT AT ANY TIME BEFORE THE LAST OF THE STATED LIVES SHOULD DROP MISTER GILES WINTERBORNE SENIOR OR HIS REPRESENTATIVE
3845-8894-0006 THE HOUSE HAD BEEN PULLED DOWN YEARS BEFORE
3845-8894-0007 THE LIKELIHOOD WAS THAT DEATH ALONE HAD HINDERED HIM IN THE EXECUTION OF HIS PROJECT
3845-8894-0008 MAN WHO TOOK MUCH PLEASURE IN DEALING WITH HOUSE PROPERTY IN HIS SMALL WAY SINCE ONE OF THE SOUTHS STILL SURVIVED THERE WAS NOT MUCH DOUBT THAT GILES COULD DO WHAT HIS FATHER HAD LEFT UNDONE AS FAR AS HIS OWN LIFE WAS CONCERNED THIS POSSIBILITY CHEERED HIM MUCH
3845-8894-0009 FOR BY THOSE HOUSES HUNG MANY THINGS MELBURY'S DOUBT OF THE YOUNG MAN'S FITNESS TO BE THE HUSBAND OF GRACE HAD BEEN BASED NOT A LITTLE ON THE PRECARIOUSNESS OF HIS HOLDINGS IN LITTLE AND GREAT HINTOCK
3845-8894-0010 THE FINE FOR RENEWAL BEING A SUM THAT HE COULD EASILY MUSTER HIS SCHEME HOWEVER
3845-8894-0011 AND MEANWHILE HE WOULD RUN UP TO SOUTH'S
3845-8894-0012 MARTY MET HIM AT THE DOOR WELL MARTY HE SAID
3845-8894-0013 I AM SORRY FOR YOUR LABOR SHE SAID IT IS ALL LOST HE SAYS THE TREE SEEMS TALLER THAN EVER WINTERBORNE LOOKED ROUND AT IT TALLER THE TREE CERTAINLY DID SEEM THE GAUNTNESS OF ITS NOW NAKED STEM BEING MORE MARKED THAN BEFORE
3845-8894-0014 IT QUITE TERRIFIED HIM WHEN HE FIRST SAW WHAT YOU HAD DONE TO IT THIS MORNING SHE ADDED
3845-8894-0015 LIKE THE SWORD OF THE LORD AND OF GIDEON WELL CAN I DO ANYTHING ELSE ASKED HE THE DOCTOR SAYS THE TREE OUGHT TO BE CUT DOWN OH
3845-8894-0016 I DIDN'T SEND FOR HIM MISSUS CHARMOND BEFORE SHE LEFT HEARD THAT FATHER WAS ILL AND TOLD HIM TO ATTEND HIM AT HER EXPENSE THAT WAS VERY GOOD OF HER AND HE SAYS IT OUGHT TO BE CUT DOWN
3845-8894-0017 UNLUCKILY THE TREE WAVED AFRESH BY THIS TIME A WIND HAVING SPRUNG UP AND BLOWN THE FOG AWAY AND HIS EYES TURNED WITH ITS WAVINGS THEY HEARD FOOTSTEPS A MAN'S BUT OF A LIGHTER TYPE THAN USUAL THERE IS DOCTOR FITZPIERS AGAIN SHE SAID AND DESCENDED
3845-8894-0018 PRESENTLY HIS TREAD WAS HEARD ON THE NAKED STAIRS MISTER FITZPIERS ENTERED THE SICK CHAMBER JUST AS A DOCTOR IS MORE OR LESS WONT TO DO ON SUCH OCCASIONS AND PRE EMINENTLY WHEN THE ROOM IS THAT OF A HUMBLE COTTAGER LOOKING ROUND TOWARDS THE PATIENT WITH THAT PREOCCUPIED GAZE
3845-8894-0019 AT HIS LAST EXIT FROM THE SAME APARTMENT HE NODDED TO WINTERBORNE
3845-8894-0020 RECALLED THE CASE TO HIS THOUGHTS AND WENT LEISURELY ON TO WHERE SOUTH SAT FITZPIERS WAS ON THE WHOLE A FINELY FORMED HANDSOME MAN HIS EYES WERE DARK AND IMPRESSIVE AND BEAMED WITH THE LIGHT EITHER OF ENERGY
3845-8894-0021 THAT QUICK GLITTERING PRACTICAL EYE SHARP FOR THE SURFACE OF THINGS AND FOR NOTHING BENEATH IT HE HAD NOT BUT WHETHER HIS APPARENT DEPTH OF VISION WAS REAL OR ONLY AN ARTISTIC ACCIDENT OF HIS CORPOREAL MOULDING NOTHING BUT HIS DEEDS COULD REVEAL
3845-8894-0022 HIS FACE WAS RATHER SOFT THAN STERN CHARMING THAN GRAND PALE THAN FLUSHED HIS NOSE
3845-8894-0023 AND WAS HENCE DEVOID OF THOSE KNOTTY IRREGULARITIES WHICH OFTEN MEAN POWER WHILE THE DOUBLE CYMA OR CLASSICAL CURVE OF HIS MOUTH WAS NOT WITHOUT A LOOSENESS IN ITS CLOSE NEVERTHELESS EITHER FROM HIS READILY APPRECIATIVE MIEN
3845-8894-0024 STRICT PEOPLE OF THE HIGHLY RESPECTABLE CLASS KNOWING A LITTLE ABOUT HIM BY REPORT MIGHT HAVE SAID THAT HE SEEMED LIKELY TO ERR RATHER IN THE POSSESSION OF TOO MANY IDEAS THAN TOO FEW TO BE A DREAMY IST OF SOME SORT OR TOO DEEPLY STEEPED IN SOME FALSE KIND OF ISM
3845-8894-0025 AS FROM THE CLOUDS UPON LITTLE HINTOCK THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY CASE HE SAID AT LAST TO WINTERBORNE AFTER EXAMINING SOUTH BY CONVERSATION LOOK AND TOUCH AND LEARNING THAT THE CRAZE ABOUT THE ELM WAS STRONGER THAN EVER COME DOWN STAIRS AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK
3845-8894-0026 THEY ACCORDINGLY DESCENDED AND THE DOCTOR CONTINUED THE TREE MUST BE CUT DOWN OR I WON'T ANSWER FOR HIS LIFE TIS MISSUS CHARMOND'S TREE AND I SUPPOSE WE MUST GET PERMISSION SAID GILES
3845-8894-0027 IF SO AS SHE IS GONE AWAY I MUST SPEAK TO HER AGENT OH NEVER MIND WHOSE TREE IT IS
3845-8894-0028 TIS TIMBER REJOINED GILES MORE SCRUPULOUS THAN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD NOT HIS OWN INTERESTS STOOD SO CLOSELY INVOLVED
3845-8894-0029 THEN WE'LL INAUGURATE A NEW ERA FORTHWITH
3845-8894-0030 WEEKS AND WEEKS SIR THE SHAPE OF IT SEEMS TO HAUNT HIM LIKE AN EVIL SPIRIT
3845-8894-0031 OTHERS HAVE BEEN LIKE IT AFORE IN HINTOCK THEY COULD HEAR SOUTH'S VOICE UP STAIRS OH HE'S ROCKING THIS WAY HE MUST COME
3845-8894-0032 DOWN WITH IT THEN AND HANG MISSUS CHARMOND SAID MISTER FITZPIERS
3845-8894-0033 OR EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE HE IS AWAKE SO THAT HE DOESN'T SEE IT FALL FOR THAT WOULD TERRIFY HIM WORSE THAN EVER KEEP THE BLIND DOWN TILL I COME AND THEN I'LL ASSURE HIM AND SHOW HIM THAT HIS TROUBLE IS OVER THE DOCTOR THEN DEPARTED AND THEY WAITED TILL THE EVENING
3845-8894-0034 WHEN IT WAS DUSK AND THE CURTAINS DRAWN WINTERBORNE DIRECTED A COUPLE OF WOODMEN TO BRING A CROSSCUT SAW AND THE TALL THREATENING TREE WAS SOON NEARLY OFF AT ITS BASE HE WOULD NOT FELL IT COMPLETELY THEN ON ACCOUNT OF THE POSSIBLE CRASH BUT NEXT MORNING BEFORE SOUTH WAS AWAKE
3845-8894-0035 THEY WENT AND LOWERED IT CAUTIOUSLY IN A DIRECTION AWAY FROM THE COTTAGE IT WAS A BUSINESS DIFFICULT TO DO QUITE SILENTLY BUT IT WAS DONE AT LAST AND THE ELM OF THE SAME BIRTH YEAR AS THE WOODMAN'S LAY STRETCHED UPON THE GROUND THE WEAKEST IDLER THAT PASSED COULD NOW SET FOOT ON MARKS FORMERLY MADE
3845-8894-0036 THEY ASCENDED THE STAIRS AND SOON SEATED HIM
3845-8894-0037 TIS GONE SEE SAID MISTER FITZPIERS AS SOON AS THE OLD MAN SAW THE VACANT PATCH OF SKY IN PLACE OF THE BRANCHED COLUMN SO FAMILIAR TO HIS GAZE HE SPRANG UP SPEECHLESS HIS EYES ROSE FROM THEIR HOLLOWS TILL THE WHITES SHOWED ALL ROUND HE FELL BACK AND A BLUISH WHITENESS OVERSPREAD HIM
3845-8894-0038 AS SOON AS HE CAME A LITTLE OUT OF HIS FIT HE GASPED OH IT IS GONE WHERE WHERE HIS WHOLE SYSTEM SEEMED PARALYZED BY AMAZEMENT
