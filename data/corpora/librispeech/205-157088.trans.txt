205-157088-0000 THAT NIGHT IN OLAF'S CABIN ALAN PUT HIMSELF BACK ON THE OLD TRACK AGAIN HE MADE NO EFFORT TO MINIMIZE THE TRAGEDY THAT HAD COME INTO HIS LIFE AND HE KNEW ITS EFFECT UPON HIM WOULD NEVER BE WIPED AWAY
205-157088-0001 AND THAT MARY STANDISH WOULD ALWAYS LIVE IN HIS THOUGHTS NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED IN THE YEARS TO COME BUT HE WAS NOT THE SORT TO LET ANY PART OF HIMSELF WITHER UP AND DIE BECAUSE OF A BLOW THAT HAD DARKENED HIS MENTAL VISIONS OF THINGS HIS PLANS LAY AHEAD OF HIM
205-157088-0002 HIS OLD AMBITIONS AND HIS DREAMS OF ACHIEVEMENT THEY SEEMED PULSELESS AND DEAD NOW BUT HE KNEW IT WAS BECAUSE HIS OWN FIRE HAD TEMPORARILY BURNED OUT AND HE REALIZED THE VITAL NECESSITY OF BUILDING IT UP AGAIN
205-157088-0003 WHILE HE WAS ATTENDING TO HIS AFFAIRS AT THE BANK OLAF SECURED INFORMATION THAT ROSSLAND WAS RESTING COMFORTABLY IN THE HOSPITAL AND HAD NOT ONE CHANCE IN TEN OF DYING IT WAS NOT ALAN'S INTENTION TO SEE HIM
205-157088-0004 AND BUSINESSLIKE INTENTION OF SIFTING THE MATTER TO THE BOTTOM THAT HE MIGHT DISPROVE HIS OWN RESPONSIBILITY AND SET HIMSELF RIGHT IN HIS OWN EYES IN SELF DEFENSE HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN ROSSLAND AN OPPORTUNITY TO BREAK DOWN WITH COLD FACTS
205-157088-0005 THE DISTURBING SOMETHING WHICH HIS MIND HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY BUILT UP BUT THE NEW ALAN REVOLTED HE WANTED TO CARRY THE THING AWAY WITH HIM HE WANTED IT TO LIVE AND SO IT WENT WITH HIM UNCONTAMINATED BY ANY TRUTHS OR LIES
205-157088-0006 WHICH ROSSLAND MIGHT HAVE TOLD HIM THEY LEFT CORDOVA EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON AND AT SUNSET THAT EVENING CAMPED ON THE TIP OF A WOODED ISLAND A MILE OR TWO FROM THE MAINLAND OLAF KNEW THE ISLAND
205-157088-0007 AND HAD CHOSEN IT FOR REASONS OF HIS OWN IT WAS PRIMITIVE AND ALIVE WITH BIRDS OLAF LOVED THE BIRDS AND THE CHEER OF THEIR VESPER SONG AND BEDTIME TWITTER COMFORTED ALAN HE SEIZED AN AX
205-157088-0008 AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SEVEN MONTHS HIS MUSCLES RESPONDED TO THE SWING OF IT AND ERICKSEN OLD AS HIS YEARS IN THE WAY OF THE NORTH WHISTLED LOUDLY AND RUMBLED A BIT OF CRUDE SONG THROUGH HIS BEARD AS HE LIGHTED A FIRE
205-157088-0009 AND THE BUBBLING OF COFFEE OVER A BED OF COALS WITH THE MYSTERIOUS DARKNESS OF THE TIMBER GATHERING IN ABOUT HIM
205-157088-0010 AND SAT WATCHING OLAF AS HE MOTHERED THE HALF BAKED BANNOCK LOAF IT MADE HIM THINK OF HIS FATHER A THOUSAND TIMES THE TWO MUST HAVE CAMPED LIKE THIS IN THE DAYS WHEN ALASKA WAS NEW AND THERE WERE NO MAPS TO TELL THEM WHAT LAY BEYOND THE NEXT RANGE
205-157088-0011 OLAF FELT RESTING UPON HIM SOMETHING OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A DOCTOR AND AFTER SUPPER HE SAT WITH HIS BACK TO A TREE AND TALKED OF THE OLD DAYS AS IF THEY WERE YESTERDAY AND THE DAY BEFORE
205-157088-0012 WITH TOMORROW ALWAYS THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW WHICH HE HAD PURSUED FOR THIRTY YEARS HE WAS SIXTY JUST A WEEK AGO THIS EVENING HE SAID AND HE WAS BEGINNING TO DOUBT IF HE WOULD REMAIN ON THE BEACH AT CORDOVA MUCH LONGER
205-157088-0013 SIBERIA WAS DRAGGING HIM THAT FORBIDDEN WORLD OF ADVENTURE AND MYSTERY AND MONUMENTAL OPPORTUNITY WHICH LAY ONLY A FEW MILES ACROSS THE STRAIT FROM THE SEWARD PENINSULA IN HIS ENTHUSIASM HE FORGOT ALAN'S TRAGEDY
205-157088-0014 HE CURSED COSSACK LAW AND THE PROHIBITORY MEASURES TO KEEP AMERICANS OUT MORE GOLD WAS OVER THERE THAN HAD EVER BEEN DREAMED OF IN ALASKA EVEN THE MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS WERE UNNAMED AND HE WAS GOING IF HE LIVED ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO
205-157088-0015 TWICE HE HAD TRIED IT SINCE HIS OLD COMRADE HAD DIED AND TWICE HE HAD BEEN DRIVEN OUT THE NEXT TIME HE WOULD KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT AND HE INVITED ALAN TO GO WITH HIM THERE WAS A THRILL IN THIS TALK OF A LAND SO NEAR
205-157088-0016 SCARCELY A NIGHT RIDE ACROSS THE NECK OF BERING SEA AND YET AS PROSCRIBED AS THE SACRED PLAINS OF TIBET IT STIRRED OLD DESIRES IN ALAN'S BLOOD FOR HE KNEW THAT OF ALL FRONTIERS THE SIBERIAN WOULD BE THE LAST AND THE GREATEST
205-157088-0017 AND THAT NOT ONLY MEN BUT NATIONS WOULD PLAY THEIR PART IN THE BREAKING OF IT HE SAW THE RED GLEAM OF FIRELIGHT IN OLAF'S EYES AND IF WE DON'T GO IN FIRST FROM THIS SIDE ALAN
205-157088-0018 THE YELLOW FELLOWS WILL COME OUT SOME DAY FROM THAT RUMBLED THE OLD SOUR DOUGH STRIKING HIS PIPE IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND AND WHEN THEY DO THEY WON'T COME OVER TO US IN ONES AN TWOS AN THREES BUT IN MILLIONS THAT'S WHAT THE YELLOW FELLOWS WILL DO
205-157088-0019 WHEN THEY ONCE GET STARTED AN IT'S UP TO A FEW ALASKA JACKS AN TOUGH NUT BILLS TO GET THEIR FEET PLANTED FIRST ON THE OTHER SIDE WILL YOU GO ALAN SHOOK HIS HEAD SOME DAY BUT NOT NOW
205-157088-0020 THE OLD FLASH WAS IN HIS EYES AND HE WAS SEEING THE FIGHT AHEAD OF HIM AGAIN THE FIGHT TO DO HIS BIT IN STRIKING THE SHACKLES OF MISGOVERNMENT FROM ALASKA AND ROUSING THE WORLD TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MENACE WHICH HUNG OVER HER
205-157088-0021 LIKE A SMOLDERING CLOUD BUT YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE DANGER HE SAID IT WON'T COME FROM JAPAN TO CALIFORNIA IT WILL POUR LIKE A FLOOD THROUGH SIBERIA AND JUMP TO ALASKA IN A NIGHT IT ISN'T THE DANGER OF THE YELLOW MAN ALONE OLAF
205-157088-0022 YOU'VE GOT TO COMBINE THAT WITH BOLSHEVISM THE MENACE OF BLACKEST RUSSIA A DISEASE WHICH IF IT CROSSES THE LITTLE NECK OF WATER AND GETS HOLD OF ALASKA WILL SHAKE THE AMERICAN CONTINENT TO BED ROCK
205-157088-0023 IT MAY BE A GENERATION FROM NOW MAYBE A CENTURY BUT IT'S COMING SURE AS GOD MAKES LIGHT IF WE LET ALASKA GO DOWN AND OUT AND MY WAY OF PREVENTING IT IS DIFFERENT FROM YOURS HE STARED INTO THE FIRE
205-157088-0024 WATCHING THE EMBERS FLARE UP AND DIE I'M NOT PROUD OF THE STATES HE WENT ON AS IF SPEAKING TO SOMETHING WHICH HE SAW IN THE FLAMES I CAN'T BE AFTER THE RUIN THEIR UNINTELLIGENT PROPAGANDA AND LEGISLATION HAVE BROUGHT UPON ALASKA
205-157088-0025 IT'S GOD'S OWN COUNTRY WE HAVE NORTH OF FIFTY EIGHT OLAF AND WE HAVE TEN TIMES THE WEALTH OF CALIFORNIA WE CAN CARE FOR A MILLION PEOPLE EASILY BUT BAD POLITICS AND BAD JUDGMENT BOTH HERE IN ALASKA AND AT WASHINGTON
205-157088-0026 WON'T LET THEM COME WITH COAL ENOUGH UNDER OUR FEET TO LAST A THOUSAND YEARS WE ARE BUYING FUEL FROM THE STATES WE'VE GOT BILLIONS IN COPPER AND OIL BUT CAN'T TOUCH THEM WE SHOULD HAVE SOME OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST MANUFACTURING PLANTS
205-157088-0027 BUT WE CAN NOT BECAUSE EVERYTHING UP HERE IS LOCKED AWAY FROM US I REPEAT THAT ISN'T CONSERVATION IF THEY HAD APPLIED A LITTLE OF IT TO THE SALMON INDUSTRY BUT THEY DIDN'T AND THE SALMON ARE GOING LIKE THE BUFFALO OF THE PLAINS
205-157088-0028 THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SALMON SHOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO US IF THE BARS ARE LET DOWN ALL AT ONCE TO THE FINANCIAL BANDITTI UNDERSTANDING AND COMMON SENSE MUST GUARD THE GATES
205-157088-0029 THE FIGHT WE MUST WIN IS TO BRING ABOUT AN HONEST AND REASONABLE ADJUSTMENT OLAF AND THAT FIGHT WILL TAKE PLACE RIGHT HERE IN ALASKA AND NOT IN SIBERIA AND IF WE DON'T WIN HE RAISED HIS EYES FROM THE FIRE
205-157088-0030 AND SMILED GRIMLY INTO OLAF'S BEARDED FACE THEN WE CAN COUNT ON THAT THING COMING ACROSS THE NECK OF SEA FROM THE GULF OF ANADYR HE FINISHED AND IF IT EVER DOES COME THE PEOPLE OF THE STATES WILL AT LAST
205-157088-0031 FACE THE TRAGIC REALIZATION OF WHAT ALASKA COULD HAVE MEANT TO THE NATION
205-157088-0032 AND AFTER THAT FOR AN HOUR OR MORE SOMETHING LIVED FOR HIM IN THE GLOW OF THE FIRE WHICH OLAF KEPT BURNING IT WAS THE MEMORY OF MARY STANDISH HER QUIET BEAUTIFUL EYES GAZING AT HIM HER PALE FACE
205-157088-0033 AND IT PLEASED HIM TO THINK SHE WOULD HAVE MADE THIS SAME FIGHT FOR ALASKA IF SHE HAD LIVED IT WAS A THOUGHT WHICH BROUGHT A PAINFUL THICKENING IN HIS BREATH FOR ALWAYS THESE VISIONS WHICH OLAF COULD NOT SEE ENDED WITH MARY STANDISH
205-157088-0034 AND ALWAYS THEY AWAKENED HIM SO THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT THE STARS AGAIN AND TRYING NOT TO THINK IN SPITE OF THE GRIEF IN HIS SOUL THEY WERE PLEASANT DREAMS AS THOUGH SOME GENTLE FORCE WERE AT WORK IN HIM SUBCONSCIOUSLY
205-157088-0035 TO WIPE AWAY THE SHADOWS OF TRAGEDY MARY STANDISH WAS WITH HIM AGAIN BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS AT SKAGWAY SHE WAS AT HIS SIDE IN THE HEART OF THE TUNDRAS THE SUN IN HER SHINING HAIR AND EYES
205-157088-0036 AND ALL ABOUT THEM THE WONDER OF WILD ROSES AND PURPLE IRIS AND WHITE SEAS OF SEDGE COTTON AND YELLOW EYED DAISIES AND BIRDS SINGING IN THE GLADNESS OF SUMMER HE HEARD THE BIRDS
205-157088-0037 AND HE HEARD THE GIRL'S VOICE ANSWERING THEM IN HER HAPPINESS AND TURNING THAT HAPPINESS FROM THE RADIANCE OF HER EYES UPON HIM
