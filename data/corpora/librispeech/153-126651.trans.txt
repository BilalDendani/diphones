153-126651-0000 ONE TIDINGS OF THE COMER
153-126651-0001 CERTAIN EPHEMERAL OPERATIONS WERE APT TO DISTURB IN THEIR TRIFLING WAY THE MAJESTIC CALM OF EGDON HEATH THEY WERE ACTIVITIES WHICH BESIDE THOSE OF A TOWN A VILLAGE OR EVEN A FARM
153-126651-0002 WOULD HAVE APPEARED AS THE FERMENT OF STAGNATION MERELY A CREEPING OF THE FLESH OF SOMNOLENCE BUT HERE AWAY FROM COMPARISONS SHUT IN BY THE STABLE HILLS AMONG WHICH MERE WALKING
153-126651-0003 HAD THE NOVELTY OF PAGEANTRY AND WHERE ANY MAN COULD IMAGINE HIMSELF TO BE ADAM WITHOUT THE LEAST DIFFICULTY THEY ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF EVERY BIRD WITHIN EYESHOT EVERY REPTILE NOT YET ASLEEP
153-126651-0004 AND SET THE SURROUNDING RABBITS CURIOUSLY WATCHING FROM HILLOCKS AT A SAFE DISTANCE THE PERFORMANCE WAS THAT OF BRINGING TOGETHER AND BUILDING INTO A STACK THE FURZE FAGGOTS
153-126651-0005 WHICH HUMPHREY HAD BEEN CUTTING FOR THE CAPTAIN'S USE DURING THE FOREGOING FINE DAYS THE STACK WAS AT THE END OF THE DWELLING AND THE MEN ENGAGED IN BUILDING IT WERE HUMPHREY AND SAM THE OLD MAN LOOKING ON
153-126651-0006 IT WAS A FINE AND QUIET AFTERNOON ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK BUT THE WINTER SOLSTICE HAVING STEALTHILY COME ON THE LOWNESS OF THE SUN CAUSED THE HOUR TO SEEM LATER THAN IT ACTUALLY WAS
153-126651-0007 THERE BEING LITTLE HERE TO REMIND AN INHABITANT THAT HE MUST UNLEARN HIS SUMMER EXPERIENCE OF THE SKY AS A DIAL IN THE COURSE OF MANY DAYS AND WEEKS
153-126651-0008 SUNRISE HAD ADVANCED ITS QUARTERS FROM NORTHEAST TO SOUTHEAST SUNSET HAD RECEDED FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHWEST BUT EGDON HAD HARDLY HEEDED THE CHANGE
153-126651-0009 EUSTACIA WAS INDOORS IN THE DINING ROOM WHICH WAS REALLY MORE LIKE A KITCHEN HAVING A STONE FLOOR AND A GAPING CHIMNEY CORNER THE AIR WAS STILL AND WHILE SHE LINGERED A MOMENT HERE ALONE
153-126651-0010 SOUNDS OF VOICES IN CONVERSATION CAME TO HER EARS DIRECTLY DOWN THE CHIMNEY SHE ENTERED THE RECESS AND LISTENING LOOKED UP THE OLD IRREGULAR SHAFT WITH ITS CAVERNOUS HOLLOWS WHERE THE SMOKE BLUNDERED ABOUT
153-126651-0011 ON ITS WAY TO THE SQUARE BIT OF SKY AT THE TOP FROM WHICH THE DAYLIGHT STRUCK DOWN WITH A PALLID GLARE UPON THE TATTERS OF SOOT DRAPING THE FLUE AS SEAWEED DRAPES A ROCKY FISSURE SHE REMEMBERED
153-126651-0012 THE FURZE STACK WAS NOT FAR FROM THE CHIMNEY AND THE VOICES WERE THOSE OF THE WORKERS HER GRANDFATHER JOINED IN THE CONVERSATION
153-126651-0013 I DON'T BELIEVE IN THESE NEW MOVES IN FAMILIES MY FATHER WAS A SAILOR SO WAS I AND SO SHOULD MY SON HAVE BEEN IF I HAD HAD ONE THE PLACE HE'S BEEN LIVING AT IS PARIS SAID HUMPHREY

153-126651-0016 IN THAT DAMNED SURGERY OF THE TRIUMPH SEEING MEN BROUGHT DOWN TO THE COCKPIT WITH THEIR LEGS AND ARMS BLOWN TO JERICHO AND SO THE YOUNG MAN HAS SETTLED IN PARIS MANAGER TO A DIAMOND MERCHANT OR SOME SUCH THING IS HE NOT

153-126651-0018 I CAN WELL MIND WHEN HE LEFT HOME SAID SAM TIS A GOOD THING FOR THE FELLER SAID HUMPHREY
153-126651-0019 AND BE NEITHER DRUNKARD NOR GLUTTON THEY SAY TOO THAT CLYM YEOBRIGHT IS BECOME A REAL PERUSING MAN WITH THE STRANGEST NOTIONS ABOUT THINGS THERE THAT'S BECAUSE HE WENT TO SCHOOL EARLY SUCH AS THE SCHOOL WAS
153-126651-0020 STRANGE NOTIONS HAS HE SAID THE OLD MAN AH THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THAT SENDING TO SCHOOL IN THESE DAYS IT ONLY DOES HARM
153-126651-0021 A WOMAN CAN HARDLY PASS FOR SHAME SOMETIMES
153-126651-0022 THEIR FATHERS COULDN'T DO IT AND THE COUNTRY WAS ALL THE BETTER FOR IT NOW I SHOULD THINK CAP'N THAT MISS EUSTACIA HAD ABOUT AS MUCH IN HER HEAD THAT COMES FROM BOOKS AS ANYBODY ABOUT HERE
153-126651-0023 SAID THE CAPTAIN SHORTLY AFTER WHICH HE WALKED AWAY I SAY SAM OBSERVED HUMPHREY WHEN THE OLD MAN WAS GONE
153-126651-0024 SHE AND CLYM YEOBRIGHT WOULD MAKE A VERY PRETTY PIGEON PAIR HEY IF THEY WOULDN'T I'LL BE DAZED BOTH OF ONE MIND ABOUT NICETIES FOR CERTAIN AND LEARNED IN PRINT
153-126651-0025 CLYM'S FAMILY IS AS GOOD AS HERS
153-126651-0026 NOTHING WOULD PLEASE ME BETTER THAN TO SEE THEM TWO MAN AND WIFE THEY'D LOOK VERY NATTY ARM IN CROOK TOGETHER AND THEIR BEST CLOTHES ON WHETHER OR NO
153-126651-0027 WELL I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CHAP TERRIBLE MUCH AFTER SO MANY YEARS

153-126651-0029 SHALL SEEM NO MORE THAN SCROFF IN HIS EYES
153-126651-0030 THAT'S A BAD TROUBLE ABOUT HIS COUSIN THOMASIN
153-126651-0031 WHAT A NUNNYWATCH WE WERE IN TO BE SURE WHEN WE HEARD THEY WEREN'T MARRIED AT ALL

153-126651-0033 YOU HAVE TIS NEWS TO ME WHILE THE FURZE GATHERERS HAD DESULTORILY CONVERSED THUS EUSTACIA'S FACE GRADUALLY BENT TO THE HEARTH
153-126651-0034 IN A PROFOUND REVERIE HER TOE UNCONSCIOUSLY TAPPING THE DRY TURF WHICH LAY BURNING AT HER FEET
153-126651-0035 A YOUNG AND CLEVER MAN WAS COMING INTO THAT LONELY HEATH FROM OF ALL CONTRASTING PLACES IN THE WORLD PARIS
153-126651-0036 MORE SINGULAR STILL THE HEATHMEN HAD INSTINCTIVELY COUPLED HER AND THIS MAN TOGETHER IN THEIR MINDS AS A PAIR BORN FOR EACH OTHER
153-126651-0037 THAT FIVE MINUTES OF OVERHEARING FURNISHED EUSTACIA WITH VISIONS ENOUGH TO FILL THE WHOLE BLANK AFTERNOON SUCH SUDDEN ALTERNATIONS FROM MENTAL VACUITY DO SOMETIMES OCCUR
153-126651-0038 THUS QUIETLY SHE COULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IN THE MORNING THAT HER COLOURLESS INNER WORLD WOULD BEFORE NIGHT BECOME AS ANIMATED AS WATER UNDER A MICROSCOPE AND THAT WITHOUT THE ARRIVAL OF A SINGLE VISITOR
153-126651-0039 THE WORDS OF SAM AND HUMPHREY ON THE HARMONY BETWEEN THE UNKNOWN AND HERSELF HAD ON HER MIND THE EFFECT OF THE INVADING BARD'S PRELUDE IN THE CASTLE OF INDOLENCE
153-126651-0040 AT WHICH MYRIADS OF IMPRISONED SHAPES AROSE WHERE HAD PREVIOUSLY APPEARED THE STILLNESS OF A VOID
153-126651-0041 WHEN SHE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF EXTERNALS IT WAS DUSK THE FURZE RICK WAS FINISHED THE MEN HAD GONE HOME EUSTACIA WENT UPSTAIRS THINKING THAT SHE WOULD TAKE A WALK AT THIS HER USUAL TIME
153-126651-0042 AND SHE DETERMINED THAT HER WALK SHOULD BE IN THE DIRECTION OF BLOOMS END THE BIRTHPLACE OF YOUNG YEOBRIGHT AND THE PRESENT HOME OF HIS MOTHER SHE HAD NO REASON FOR WALKING ELSEWHERE AND
153-126651-0043 WHY SHOULD SHE NOT GO THAT WAY THE SCENE OF THE DAYDREAM IS SUFFICIENT FOR A PILGRIMAGE AT NINETEEN TO LOOK AT THE PALINGS BEFORE THE YEOBRIGHTS HOUSE HAD THE DIGNITY OF A NECESSARY PERFORMANCE
153-126651-0044 STRANGE THAT SUCH A PIECE OF IDLING SHOULD HAVE SEEMED AN IMPORTANT ERRAND SHE PUT ON HER BONNET AND LEAVING THE HOUSE DESCENDED THE HILL ON THE SIDE TOWARDS BLOOMS END
153-126651-0045 OF A MILE AND A HALF THIS BROUGHT HER TO A SPOT IN WHICH THE GREEN BOTTOM OF THE DALE BEGAN TO WIDEN
153-126651-0046 TILL THEY WERE DIMINISHED TO AN ISOLATED ONE HERE AND THERE BY THE INCREASING FERTILITY OF THE SOIL
153-126651-0047 WHICH MARKED THE VERGE OF THE HEATH IN THIS LATITUDE THEY SHOWED UPON THE DUSKY SCENE THAT THEY BORDERED AS DISTINCTLY AS WHITE LACE ON VELVET BEHIND THE WHITE PALINGS WAS A LITTLE GARDEN BEHIND THE GARDEN
153-126651-0048 AN OLD IRREGULAR THATCHED HOUSE FACING THE HEATH AND COMMANDING A FULL VIEW OF THE VALLEY THIS WAS THE OBSCURE REMOVED SPOT TO WHICH WAS ABOUT TO RETURN A MAN WHOSE LATTER LIFE
153-126651-0049 HAD BEEN PASSED IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL THE CENTRE AND VORTEX
