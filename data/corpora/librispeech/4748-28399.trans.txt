4748-28399-0000 NOTWITHSTANDING THE AIDS AND DISGUISES OF DRESS OF FIGURE EXTERNAL INDICATIONS AS TO FIGURE ARE REQUIRED CHIEFLY AS TO THE LIMBS WHICH ARE CONCEALED BY DRAPERY
4748-28399-0001 SUCH INDICATIONS ARE AFFORDED BY THE WALK TO EVERY CAREFUL OBSERVER IN CONSIDERING THE PROPORTION OF THE LIMBS TO THE BODY IF EVEN IN A YOUNG WOMAN THE WALK THOUGH OTHERWISE GOOD BE HEAVY
4748-28399-0002 OR THE FALL ON EACH FOOT ALTERNATELY BE SUDDEN AND RATHER UPON THE HEEL THE LIMBS THOUGH WELL FORMED WILL BE FOUND TO BE SLENDER COMPARED WITH THE BODY
4748-28399-0003 AND IT IS FREQUENTLY OBSERVABLE IN THE WOMAN OF THE SAXON POPULATION OF ENGLAND
4748-28399-0004 AND UPPER PART OF THE CHEST AT EVERY STEP IN WALKING IN CONSIDERING
4748-28399-0005 IF VIEWED BEHIND THE FEET AT EVERY STEP ARE THROWN OUT BACKWARD AND SOMEWHAT LATERALLY THE KNEES ARE CERTAINLY MUCH INCLINED INWARD IF VIEWED IN FRONT THE DRESS AT EVERY STEP
4748-28399-0006 IS AS IT WERE GATHERED TOWARD THE FRONT AND THEN TOSSED MORE OR LESS TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE KNEES ARE CERTAINLY TOO MUCH INCLINED IN CONSIDERING THE RELATIVE SIZE OF EACH PORTION OF THE LIMBS
4748-28399-0007 AND THE KNEE AND ANCLE JOINTS WHICH REMAIN PROPORTIONALLY UNEMPLOYED IF IN THE WALK THE TRIPPING PACE BE USED AS IN AN APPROACH TO WALKING ON TIPTOES THE CALF IS LARGE
4748-28399-0008 FOR IT IS ONLY BY THE POWER OF ITS MUSCLES THAT UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE WHOLE BODY THE FOOT CAN BE EXTENDED FOR THIS PURPOSE IF IN THE WALK THE FOOT BE RAISED IN A SLOVENLY MANNER
4748-28399-0009 AND THE HEEL BE SEEN AT EACH STEP TO LIFT THE BOTTOM OF THE DRESS UPWARD AND BACKWARD NEITHER THE HIP NOR THE CALF IS WELL DEVELOPED
4748-28399-0010 MUCH DECEPTION OCCURS IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE ARTS EMPLOYED FOR THIS PURPOSE AT LEAST BY SKILFUL WOMEN A PERSON HAVING A NARROW FACE WEARS A BONNET
4748-28399-0011 WITH WIDE FRONT EXPOSING THE LOWER PART OF THE CHEEKS ONE HAVING A BROAD FACE WEARS A CLOSER FRONT AND IF THE JAW BE WIDE IT IS IN APPEARANCE DIMINISHED BY BRINGING THE CORNERS OF THE BONNET
4748-28399-0012 SLOPING TO THE POINT OF THE CHIN A PERSON HAVING A LONG NECK HAS THE NECK OF THE BONNET DESCENDING THE NECK OF THE DRESS RISING AND FILLING MORE OR LESS OF THE INTERMEDIATE SPACE
4748-28399-0013 ONE HAVING A SHORT NECK HAS THE WHOLE BONNET SHORT AND CLOSE IN THE PERPENDICULAR DIRECTION AND THE NECK OF THE DRESS NEITHER HIGH NOR WIDE
4748-28399-0014 PERSONS WITH NARROW SHOULDERS HAVE THE SHOULDERS OR EPAULETS OF THE DRESS FORMED ON THE OUTER EDGE OF THE NATURAL SHOULDER VERY FULL AND BOTH THE BOSOM AND BACK OF THE DRESS RUNNING IN OBLIQUE FOLDS
4748-28399-0015 FROM THE POINT OF THE SHOULDER TO THE MIDDLE OF THE BUST PERSONS WITH WAISTS TOO LARGE RENDER THEM LESS BEFORE BY A STOMACHER OR SOMETHING EQUIVALENT
4748-28399-0016 AND BEHIND BY A CORRESPONDING FORM OF THE DRESS MAKING THE TOP OF THE DRESS SMOOTH ACROSS THE SHOULDERS AND DRAWING IT IN PLAITS TO A NARROW POINT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WAIST
4748-28399-0017 THOSE WHO HAVE THE BOSOM TOO SMALL ENLARGE IT BY THE OBLIQUE FOLDS OF THE DRESS BEING GATHERED ABOVE AND BY OTHER MEANS THOSE WHO HAVE THE LOWER POSTERIOR PART OF THE BODY TOO FLAT
4748-28399-0018 ELEVATE IT BY THE TOP OF THE SKIRT BEING GATHERED BEHIND AND BY OTHER LESS SKILFUL ADJUSTMENTS WHICH THOUGH HID ARE EASILY DETECTED
4748-28399-0019 THOSE WHO HAVE THE LOWER PART OF THE BODY TOO PROMINENT ANTERIORLY RENDER IT LESS APPARENT BY SHORTENING THE WAIST BY A CORRESPONDING PROJECTION BEHIND AND BY INCREASING THE BOSOM ABOVE
4748-28399-0020 THOSE WHO HAVE THE HAUNCHES TOO NARROW TAKE CARE NOT TO HAVE THE BOTTOM OF THE DRESS TOO WIDE TALL WOMEN HAVE A WIDE SKIRT OR SEVERAL FLOUNCES OR BOTH OF THESE
4748-28399-0021 OF BEAUTY ADDITIONAL INDICATIONS AS TO BEAUTY ARE REQUIRED CHIEFLY WHERE THE WOMAN OBSERVED PRECEDES THE OBSERVER
4748-28399-0022 AND MAY BY HER FIGURE NATURALLY AND REASONABLY EXCITE HIS INTEREST WHILE AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE RUDE TO TURN AND LOOK IN HER FACE ON PASSING
4748-28399-0023 THERE CAN THEREFORE BE NO IMPROPRIETY IN OBSERVING THAT THE CONDUCT OF THOSE WHO MAY HAPPEN TO MEET THE WOMEN THUS PRECEDING WILL DIFFER ACCORDING TO THE SEX OF THE PERSON WHO MEETS HER
4748-28399-0024 IF THE PERSON MEETING HER BE A WOMAN THE CASE BECOMES MORE COMPLEX IF BOTH BE EITHER UGLY OR BEAUTIFUL OR IF THE PERSON MEETING HER BE BEAUTIFUL AND THE LADY OBSERVED BE UGLY
4748-28399-0025 CASTING MERELY AN INDIFFERENT GLANCE IF ON THE CONTRARY THE WOMAN MEETING HER BE UGLY AND THE LADY OBSERVED BE BEAUTIFUL THEN THE FORMER WILL EXAMINE THE LATTER WITH THE SEVEREST SCRUTINY
4748-28399-0026 AND IF SHE SEES FEATURES AND SHAPE WITHOUT DEFECT SHE WILL INSTANTLY FIX HER EYES ON THE HEAD DRESS OR GOWN IN ORDER TO FIND SOME OBJECT FOR CENSURE OF THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AND FOR CONSOLATION IN HER OWN UGLINESS
4748-28399-0027 MAY BE AIDED IN DETERMINING WHETHER IT IS WORTH HIS WHILE TO GLANCE AT HER FACE IN PASSING OR TO DEVISE OTHER MEANS OF SEEING IT EVEN WHEN THE FACE IS SEEN AS IN MEETING IN THE STREETS OR ELSEWHERE
4748-28399-0028 INFINITE DECEPTION OCCURS AS TO THE DEGREE OF BEAUTY THIS OPERATES SO POWERFULLY THAT A CORRECT ESTIMATE OF BEAUTY IS PERHAPS NEVER FORMED AT FIRST
4748-28399-0029 FOR THIS REASON IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLES ACCORDING TO WHICH COLORS ARE EMPLOYED AT LEAST BY SKILFUL WOMEN WHEN IT IS THE FAULT OF A FACE TO CONTAIN TOO MUCH YELLOW
4748-28399-0030 THEN YELLOW AROUND THE FACE IS USED TO REMOVE IT BY CONTRAST AND TO CAUSE THE RED AND BLUE TO PREDOMINATE WHEN IT IS THE FAULT OF A FACE TO CONTAIN TOO MUCH RED
4748-28399-0031 THEN RED AROUND THE FACE IS USED TO REMOVE BY CONTRAST AND TO CAUSE THE YELLOW AND BLUE TO PREDOMINATE WHEN IT IS THE FAULT OF A FACE TO CONTAIN TOO MUCH BLUE THEN BLUE AROUND THE FACE IS USED TO REMOVE IT BY CONTRAST
4748-28399-0032 THEN PURPLE IS USED WHEN IT IS THE FAULT OF A FACE TO CONTAIN TOO MUCH BLUE AND YELLOW
4748-28399-0033 IN BOTH THESE CASES THE COLOR EMPLOYED IS NO LONGER THAT WHICH IS PLACED AROUND THE FACE AND WHICH ACTS ON IT BY CONTRAST BUT THE OPPOSITE
4748-28399-0034 AS GREEN AROUND THE FACE HEIGHTENS A FAINT RED IN THE CHEEKS BY CONTRAST SO THE PINK LINING OF THE BONNET AIDS IT BY REFLECTION
4748-28399-0035 AND CARE IS THEN TAKEN THAT THESE LININGS DO NOT COME INTO THE DIRECT VIEW OF THE OBSERVER AND OPERATE PREJUDICIALLY ON THE FACE BY CONTRAST OVERPOWERING THE LITTLE COLOR WHICH BY REFLECTION THEY SHOULD HEIGHTEN
4748-28399-0036 THE FRONTS OF BONNETS SO LINED THEREFORE DO NOT WIDEN GREATLY FORWARD AND BRING THEIR COLOR INTO CONTRAST WHEN BONNETS DO WIDEN THE PROPER CONTRAST IS USED AS A LINING
4748-28399-0037 BUT THEN IT HAS NOT A SURFACE MUCH ADAPTED FOR REFLECTION OTHERWISE IT MAY PERFORM THAT OFFICE AND INJURE THE COMPLEXION UNDERSTANDING THEN THE APPLICATION OF THESE COLORS IN A GENERAL WAY
4748-28399-0038 IT MAY BE NOTICED THAT FAIR FACES ARE BY CONTRAST BEST ACTED ON BY LIGHT COLORS AND DARK FACES BY DARKER COLORS DARK FACES ARE BEST AFFECTED BY DARKER COLORS
4748-28399-0039 EVIDENTLY BECAUSE THEY TEND TO RENDER THE COMPLEXION FAIRER AND FAIR FACES DO NOT REQUIRE DARK COLORS BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION WOULD BE TOO STRONG
4748-28399-0040 REFLECT THEIR HUES UPON IT ALWAYS EITHER IMPROVE OR INJURE THE COMPLEXION FOR THIS AND SOME OTHER REASONS MANY PERSONS LOOK BETTER AT HOME IN THEIR APARTMENTS THAN IN THE STREETS
4748-28399-0041 OF MIND EXTERNAL INDICATIONS AS TO MIND MAY BE DERIVED FROM FIGURE
4748-28399-0042 AS TO FIGURE A CERTAIN SYMMETRY OR DISPROPORTION OF PARTS EITHER OF WHICH DEPENDS IMMEDIATELY UPON THE LOCOMOTIVE SYSTEM OR A CERTAIN SOFTNESS OR HARDNESS OF FORM
4748-28399-0043 THESE RECIPROCALLY DENOTE A LOCOMOTIVE SYMMETRY OR DISPROPORTION OR A VITAL SOFTNESS OR HARDNESS OR A MENTAL DELICACY OR COARSENESS
4748-28399-0044 WHICH WILL BE FOUND ALSO INDICATED BY THE FEATURES OF THE FACE THESE QUALITIES ARE MARKED IN PAIRS AS EACH BELONGING TO ITS RESPECTIVE SYSTEM FOR WITHOUT THIS THERE CAN BE NO ACCURATE OR USEFUL OBSERVATION
4748-28399-0045 AS TO GAIT THAT PROGRESSION WHICH ADVANCES UNMODIFIED BY ANY LATERAL MOVEMENT OF THE BODY OR ANY PERPENDICULAR RISING OF THE HEAD AND WHICH BELONGS EXCLUSIVELY TO THE LOCOMOTIVE SYSTEM
4748-28399-0046 OR THAT PERPENDICULAR RISING OR FALLING OF THE HEAD AT EVERY IMPULSE TO STEP WHICH BELONGS EXCLUSIVELY TO THE MENTAL SYSTEM THESE RECIPROCALLY INDICATE A CORRESPONDING LOCOMOTIVE OR VITAL OR MENTAL CHARACTER
4748-28399-0047 WHICH WILL BE FOUND ALSO INDICATED BY THE FEATURES OF THE FACE TO PUT TO THE TEST THE UTILITY OF THESE ELEMENTS OF OBSERVATION AND INDICATION LET US TAKE A FEW INSTANCES
4748-28399-0048 IF IN ANY INDIVIDUAL LOCOMOTIVE SYMMETRY OF FIGURE IS COMBINED WITH DIRECT AND LINEAR GAIT
4748-28399-0049 BUT COLD AND INSIPID IS INDICATED IF VITAL SOFTNESS OF FIGURE IS COMBINED WITH A GENTLE LATERAL ROLLING OF THE BODY IN ITS GAIT VOLUPTUOUS CHARACTER AND EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE ARE INDICATED
4748-28399-0050 IF DELICACY OF OUTLINE IN THE FIGURE BE COMBINED WITH PERPENDICULAR RISING OF THE HEAD LEVITY PERHAPS VANITY IS INDICATED
4748-28399-0051 THE GAIT HOWEVER IS OFTEN FORMED IN A GREAT MEASURE BY LOCAL OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES BY WHICH IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE OBSERVER SHOULD AVOID BEING MISLED DRESS AS AFFORDING INDICATIONS
4748-28399-0052 THOUGH LESS TO BE RELIED ON THAN THE PRECEDING IS NOT WITHOUT ITS VALUE THE WOMAN WHO POSSESSES A CULTIVATED TASTE AND A CORRESPONDING EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE WILL GENERALLY BE TASTEFULLY DRESSED
4748-28399-0053 AND THE VULGAR WOMAN WITH FEATURES CORRESPONDINGLY RUDE WILL EASILY BE SEEN THROUGH THE INAPPROPRIATE MASK IN WHICH HER MILLINER OR DRESSMAKER MAY HAVE INVESTED HER
4748-28399-0054 OF HABITS EXTERNAL INDICATIONS AS TO THE PERSONAL HABITS OF WOMEN ARE BOTH NUMEROUS AND INTERESTING
4748-28399-0055 THE HABIT OF CHILD BEARING IS INDICATED BY A FLATTER BREAST A BROADER BACK AND THICKER CARTILAGES OF THE BONES OF THE PUBIS NECESSARILY WIDENING THE PELVIS
4748-28399-0056 THE SAME HABIT IS ALSO INDICATED BY A HIGH RISE OF THE NAPE OF THE NECK SO THAT THE NECK FROM THAT POINT BENDS CONSIDERABLY FORWARD AND BY AN ELEVATION WHICH IS DIFFUSED BETWEEN THE NECK AND SHOULDERS
4748-28399-0057 FROM THE HABIT OF THROWING THE SHOULDERS BACKWARD DURING PREGNANCY AND THE HEAD AGAIN FORWARD TO BALANCE THE ABDOMINAL WEIGHT
4748-28399-0058 PECULIARLY EXPRESSIVE THE SAME HABIT IS LIKEWISE INDICATED BY AN EXCESS OF THAT LATERAL ROLLING OF THE BODY IN WALKING WHICH WAS ALREADY DESCRIBED AS CONNECTED WITH VOLUPTUOUS CHARACTER
4748-28399-0059 THIS IS A VERY CERTAIN INDICATION AS IT ARISES FROM TEMPORARY DISTENSIONS OF THE PELVIS WHICH NOTHING ELSE CAN OCCASION AS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS LATERAL ROLLING OF THE BODY
4748-28399-0060 AND OF THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY BEING MUCH THROWN FORWARD IN GESTATION THE TOES ARE TURNED SOMEWHAT INWARD THEY AID IN THE INDICATION
4748-28399-0061 BOTH IN MOTHERS AND NURSERY MAIDS BY THE RIGHT SHOULDER BEING LARGER AND MORE ELEVATED THAN THE LEFT THE HABITS OF THE SEAMSTRESS ARE INDICATED BY THE NECK SUDDENLY BENDING FORWARD
4748-28399-0062 AND THE ARMS BEING EVEN IN WALKING CONSIDERABLY BENT FORWARD OR FOLDED MORE OR LESS UPWARD FROM THE ELBOWS HABITS OF LABOR ARE INDICATED BY A CONSIDERABLE THICKNESS OF THE SHOULDERS BELOW
4748-28399-0063 WHERE THEY FORM AN ANGLE WITH THE INNER PART OF THE ARM
4748-28399-0064 THE ELBOWS ARE TURNED OUTWARD AND THE PALMS OF THE HANDS BACKWARD OF AGE EXTERNAL INDICATIONS OF AGE ARE REQUIRED CHIEFLY WHERE THE FACE IS VEILED
4748-28399-0065 OR WHERE THE WOMAN OBSERVED PRECEDES THE OBSERVER AND MAY REASONABLY EXCITE HIS INTEREST IN EITHER OF THESE CASES IF THE FOOT AND ANKLE HAVE LOST A CERTAIN MODERATE PLUMPNESS
4748-28399-0066 AND ASSUMED A CERTAIN SINEWY OR BONY APPEARANCE
4748-28399-0067 THEN HAS THE WOMAN IN GENERAL PASSED THE MERIDIAN OF LIFE UNLIKE THE LAST INDICATION THIS IS APPARENT HOWEVER THE FOOT AND ANKLE MAY BE CLOTHED
4748-28399-0068 WHICH UNFITS THE MUSCLES TO RECEIVE THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY BY MAINTAINING THE EXTENSION OF THE ANKLE JOINT EXCEPTIONS TO THIS LAST INDICATION ARE TO BE FOUND CHIEFLY IN WOMEN IN WHOM THE DEVELOPMENTS OF THE BODY ARE PROPORTIONALLY MUCH GREATER
