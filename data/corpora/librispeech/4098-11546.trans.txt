4098-11546-0000 BUT DENIS OGLETHORPE DID NOT APPEAR AGAIN FOR SEVERAL DAYS PERHAPS BUSINESS DETAINED HIM PERHAPS HE WENT OFTENER TO SEE PRISCILLA AT ANY RATE HE DID NOT CALL AGAIN UNTIL THE END OF THE WEEK
4098-11546-0001 LADY THROCKMORTON WAS IN HER PRIVATE ROOM WHEN HE CAME AND AS HE MADE HIS ENTRANCE WITH AS LITTLE CEREMONY AS USUAL HE RAN IN UPON THEODORA NOW TO TELL THE TRUTH HE HAD UNTIL THIS MOMENT FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THAT YOUNG PERSON'S VERY EXISTENCE
4098-11546-0002 HE SAW SO MANY PRETTY GIRLS IN A DAY'S ROUND AND HE WAS SO OFTEN TOO BUSY TO NOTICE HALF OF THEM THOUGH HE WAS AN ADMIRER OF PRETTY GIRLS THAT IT WAS NOTHING NEW TO SEE ONE AND FORGET HER UNTIL CHANCE THREW THEM TOGETHER AGAIN OF COURSE
4098-11546-0003 HE HAD NOTICED THEODORA NORTH THAT FIRST NIGHT HOW COULD A MAN HELP NOTICING HER AND THE SOMETHING BEAUTIFULLY OVER AWED AND BASHFULLY CURIOUS IN HER LOVELY UNCOMMON EYES HAD HALF AMUSED HIM AND YET UNTIL THIS MOMENT HE HAD FORGOTTEN HER
4098-11546-0004 WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF PROOFS AND PRINTERS AND PRISCILLA BUT WHEN AFTER RUNNING LIGHTLY UP THE STAIR CASE HE OPENED THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR AND SAW A TALL
4098-11546-0005 BENDING OVER SABRE AND STROKING HIS HUGE TAWNY HEAD WITH HER SUPPLE LITTLE TENDER HAND HE REMEMBERED AH YES HE EXCLAIMED IN AN ADMIRING ASIDE TO BE SURE I HAD FORGOTTEN THEODORA
4098-11546-0006 BUT THEODORA HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HIM THE MOMENT SHE SAW HIM SHE STOOD UP BLUSHING AND WITH A LIGHT IN HER EYES IT WAS ODD HOW UN ENGLISH SHE LOOKED AND YET HOW THOROUGHLY ENGLISH SHE WAS IN THAT DELICIOUS UNCOMFORTABLE TRICK
4098-11546-0007 OF BLUSHING VIVIDLY UPON ALL OCCASIONS SHE WAS QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THE PURPLE CLOTH WAS SO BECOMING AND THAT ITS SWEEP OF STRAIGHT HEAVY FOLDS MADE HER AS STATELY AS SOME RAJAH'S DARK EYED DAUGHTER SHE DID NOT FEEL STATELY AT ALL
4098-11546-0008 SHE ONLY FELT SOMEWHAT CONFUSED AND RATHER GLAD THAT MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE HAD SURPRISED HER BY COMING AGAIN HOW MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE WOULD HAVE SMILED IF HE HAD KNOWN WHAT AN INNOCENT COMMOTION HIS SIMPLE PRESENCE CREATED
4098-11546-0009 LADY THROCKMORTON IS UP STAIRS READING SHE EXPLAINED I WILL GO AND TELL HER YOU ARE HERE THERE WERE NO BELLS IN THE HOUSE AT DOWNPORT AND NO SERVANTS TO ANSWER IF ANY ONE HAD RANG ONE AND VERY NATURALLY THEO FORGOT SHE WAS NOT AT DOWNPORT EXCUSE ME NO
4098-11546-0010 SAID MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE I WOULD NOT DISTURB HER ON ANY ACCOUNT AND BESIDES I KNOW SHE WILL BE DOWN DIRECTLY SHE NEVER READS LATE IN THE EVENING THIS IS A VERY HANDSOME DOG MISS NORTH VERY HANDSOME INDEED WAS THEO'S REPLY COME HERE SABRE
4098-11546-0011 SABRE STALKED MAJESTICALLY TO HER SIDE AND LAID HIS HEAD UPON HER KNEE THEO STROKED HIM SOFTLY RAISING HER EYES QUITE SERIOUSLY TO MISTER OGLETHORPE'S FACE HE REMINDS ME OF SIR DUGALD HIMSELF SHE SAID
4098-11546-0012 MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE SMILED FAINTLY HE WAS NOT VERY FOND OF SIR DUGALD
4098-11546-0013 HAD AMOUNTED TO A VERY EXCELLENT JOKE DOES HE HE RETURNED AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE AND THEN HIS GLANCE MEETING THEO'S SHE BROKE INTO A LITTLE BURST OF HORROR STRICKEN SELF REPROACH OH DEAR
4098-11546-0014 SHE EXCLAIMED I OUGHTN'T TO HAVE SAID THAT OUGHT I I FORGOT HOW RUDE IT WOULD SOUND BUT INDEED I ONLY MEANT THAT SABRE WAS SO SLOW AND HEAVY AND AND SO INDIFFERENT TO PEOPLE SOMEHOW I DON'T THINK HE CARES ABOUT BEING LIKED AT ALL
4098-11546-0015 SHE WAS SO ABASHED AT HER BLUNDER THAT SHE LOOKED ABSOLUTELY IMPLORING AND MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE SMILED AGAIN HE FELT INCLINED TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH THEODORA THERE IS A LITTLE GIRL STAYING AT LADY THROCKMORTON'S HE HAD SAID TO PRISCILLA
4098-11546-0016 A RELATIVE OF HERS A PRETTY CREATURE TOO PRISCILLA FOR A BREAD AND BUTTER MISS BUT JUST AT THIS MOMENT HE THOUGHT BETTER OF THE MATTER WHAT TENDER SPEECHFUL EYES SHE HAD HE WAS AROUSED TO A RECOGNITION OF THEIR BEAUTY ALL AT ONCE
4098-11546-0017 WHAT CONTOUR THERE WAS IN THE TURN OF ARM AND SHOULDER UNDER THE CLOSE FITTING PURPLE CLOTH HE WAS ARTISTICALLY THANKFUL THAT THERE WAS NO OTHER TRIMMING OF THE STRAIGHT BODICE THAN THE LINE OF BUTTONS THAT DESCENDED FROM THE FULL WHITE RUFF OF SWANSDOWN AT HER THROAT
4098-11546-0018 HER UNCONSCIOUS STATELINESS OF GIRLISH FORM AND THE CONSCIOUS SHYNESS OF HER MANNER WERE THE LOVELIEST INCONSISTENCY IN THE WORLD OH I SHALL NOT TELL SIR DUGALD HE SAID TO HER GOOD HUMOREDLY
4098-11546-0019 I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING IN LONDON SO LIKE SIR DUGALD AS SIR DUGALD'S DOG THEODORA STROKED SABRE APOLOGETICALLY BUT COULD SCARCELY FIND COURAGE TO SPEAK SHE HAD STOOD SOMEWHAT IN AWE OF MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE EVEN AT FIRST
4098-11546-0020 AND HER DISCOMFORT WAS RAPIDLY INCREASING HE MUST THINK HER DREADFULLY STUPID THOUGH HE WAS GOOD HUMORED ENOUGH TO MAKE LIGHT OF HER SILLY SPEECH CERTAINLY PRISCILLA NEVER MADE SUCH A SILLY SPEECH IN HER LIFE BUT THEN
4098-11546-0021 HOW COULD ONE TEACH FRENCH AND LATIN AND BE ANYTHING BUT PONDEROUSLY DISCREET MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE WAS NOT THINKING OF PRISCILLA'S WISDOM HOWEVER HE WAS THINKING OF THEODORA NORTH HE WAS THINKING THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY BLIND
4098-11546-0022 BUT HE HAD BEEN TIRED AND FAGGED OUT HE REMEMBERED ON THE FIRST OCCASION OF THEIR MEETING TOO TIRED TO THINK OF ANYTHING BUT HIS APPOINTMENT AT BROOME STREET AND PRISCILLA'S GREEK GRAMMAR AND NOW IN RECOGNIZING WHAT HE HAD BEFORE PASSED BY
4098-11546-0023 HE WAS QUITE GLAD TO FIND THE GIRL SO YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED SO MODEST IN A SWEET WAY IT WAS EASY AS WELL AS PROPER ENOUGH TO TALK TO HER UNCEREMONIOUSLY WITHOUT THE TROUBLE OF BEING DIFFUSE AND COMPLIMENTARY SO HE MADE HIMSELF AGREEABLE
4098-11546-0024 AND THEODORA LISTENED UNTIL SHE QUITE FORGOT SIR DUGALD AND ONLY REMEMBERED SABRE BECAUSE HIS BIG HEAVY HEAD WAS ON HER KNEE AND SHE WAS STROKING IT AND YOU WERE NEVER IN LONDON BEFORE HE SAID AT LENGTH NO SIR THEO ANSWERED
4098-11546-0025 I WAS NEVER EVEN OUT OF DOWNPORT BEFORE THEN WE MUST TAKE YOU TO SEE THE LIONS HE SAID IF LADY THROCKMORTON WILL LET US MISS THEODORA I WONDER IF SHE WOULD LET US IF SHE WOULD I HAVE A LADY FRIEND WHO KNOWS THEM ALL FROM THE GRISLIEST DOWNWARD
4098-11546-0026 AND I KNOW SHE WOULD LIKE TO HELP ME TO EXHIBIT THEM TO YOU HOW SHOULD YOU LIKE THAT BETTER THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD GLOWING WITH DELIGHTED SURPRISE IF IT WOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE SHE ADDED QUITE APOLOGETICALLY MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE SMILED
4098-11546-0027 IT WOULD BE SIMPLY DELIGHTFUL HE SAID I SHOULD LIKE IT BETTER THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD TOO WE WILL APPEAL TO LADY THROCKMORTON WHEN PRISCILLA WAS IN LONDON THEODORA WAS BEGINNING A MINUTE LATER
4098-11546-0028 WHEN THE HANDSOME FACE CHANGED SUDDENLY AS HER COMPANION TURNED UPON HER IN EVIDENT SURPRISE PRISCILLA HE REPEATED AFTER HER
4098-11546-0029 I MEANT TO SAY PAMELA MY ELDEST SISTER'S NAME IS PAMELA AND AND AND YOU SAID PRISCILLA BY MISTAKE INTERPOSED OGLETHORPE WITH A SUDDEN ACCESSION OF GRAVITY PRISCILLA IS A LITTLE LIKE PAMELA
4098-11546-0030 IT NEEDED NOTHING MORE THAN THIS SIMPLE SLIP OF THEODORA NORTH'S TONGUE TO ASSURE HIM THAT LADY THROCKMORTON HAD BEEN TELLING HER THE STORY OF HIS ENGAGEMENT TO MISS GOWER AND AS MIGHT BE ANTICIPATED HE WAS NOT AS DEVOUTLY GRATEFUL TO HER LADYSHIP AS HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
4098-11546-0031 HE WAS CARELESS TO A FAULT IN SOME THINGS AND PUNCTILIOUS TO A FAULT IN OTHERS AND HE WAS VERY PUNCTILIOUS ABOUT PRISCILLA GOWER HE WAS NOT AN ARDENT LOVER BUT HE WAS A CONSCIENTIOUSLY HONORABLE ONE
4098-11546-0032 AND APART FROM HIS RESPECT FOR HIS BETROTHED HE WAS VERY IMPATIENT OF INTERFERENCE WITH HIS AFFAIRS AND MY LADY WAS NOT CHARY OF INTERFERING WHEN THE FANCY SEIZED HER IT ROUSED HIS PRIDE TO THINK HOW LIBERALLY HE MUST HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED AND CONSEQUENTLY
4098-11546-0033 WHEN LADY THROCKMORTON JOINED THEM HE WAS NOT IN THE MOST AMIABLE OF MOODS BUT HE MANAGED TO END HIS CONVERSATION WITH THEO UNCONSTRAINEDLY ENOUGH HE EVEN GAINED HER LADYSHIP'S CONSENT TO THEIR PLAN
4098-11546-0034 IT WAS CURIOUSLY PLAIN HOW THEY BOTH APPEARED TO AGREE IN THINKING HER A CHILD AND TREATING HER AS ONE NOT THAT THEO CARED ABOUT THAT
4098-11546-0035 BUT FREE FROM ANY TOUCH OF LIGHT GALLANTRY AS HIS MANNER TOWARD THE GIRL WAS DENIS OGLETHORPE DID NOT FORGET HER THIS NIGHT ON THE CONTRARY HE REMEMBERED HER VERY DISTINCTLY AND HAD IN HIS MIND A VERY EXACT MENTAL REPRESENTATION OF HER PURPLE ROBE
4098-11546-0036 SOFT WHITE RUFF AND ALL AS HE BUTTONED UP HIS PALETOT OVER HIS CHEST IN WALKING HOMEWARD BUT HE THOUGHT OF HER CARELESSLY AND HONESTLY ENOUGH AS A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG CREATURE YEARS BEHIND HIM IN EXPERIENCE
4098-11546-0037 AND UTTERLY BEYOND HIM IN ALL POSSIBILITY OF ANY SENTIMENTAL FANCY THE FRIENDSHIP EXISTING BETWEEN LADY THROCKMORTON AND THIS YOUNG MAN WAS A QUEER INCONSISTENT SENTIMENT ENOUGH AND YET WAS A FRIENDSHIP AND A MATURE ONE
4098-11546-0038 THE TWO HAD ENCOUNTERED EACH OTHER SOME YEARS AGO WHEN DENIS HAD BEEN BY NO MEANS IN HIS PALMIEST DAYS IN FACT MY LADY HAD PICKED HIM UP WHEN HE STOOD IN SORE NEED OF FRIENDS AND OGLETHORPE NEVER FORGOT A FAVOR
4098-11546-0039 HE NEVER FORGOT TO BE GRATEFUL TO LADY THROCKMORTON AND SO DESPITE THE WIDE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR RESPECTIVE AGES AND POSITIONS THEIR MUTUAL LIKING HAD RIPENED INTO A FAMILIARITY OF RELATIONSHIP WHICH MADE THEM MORE LIKE ELDER SISTER AND YOUNGER BROTHER THAN ANYTHING ELSE
4098-11546-0040 OGLETHORPE JUNIOR WAS PRETTY MUCH WHAT OGLETHORPE SENIOR HAD BEEN AND NOTWITHSTANDING HER PRACTICAL VIEWS LADY THROCKMORTON LIKED HIM NONE THE WORSE FOR IT SHE PETTED AND PATRONIZED HIM QUESTIONED AND ADVISED HIM AND IF HE DID NOT PLEASE HER
4098-11546-0041 IN FACT SHE WAS A WOMAN OF CAPRICES EVEN AT SIXTY FIVE AND DENIS OGLETHORPE WAS ONE OF HER CAPRICES AND IN LIKE MANNER THEODORA NORTH BECAME ANOTHER OF THEM FINDING HER TRACTABLE SHE BECAME QUITE FOND OF HER IN HER OWN WAY
4098-11546-0042 AND WAS AT LEAST GENEROUS TO LAVISHNESS IN HER TREATMENT OF HER YOU ARE VERY HANDSOME INDEED THEODORA SHE SAID TO HER A FEW DAYS AFTER HER ARRIVAL OF COURSE YOU KNOW THAT
4098-11546-0043 YOUR FIGURE IS PERFECT AND YOU HAVE EYES LIKE A SYRIAN INSTEAD OF A COMMONPLACE ENGLISH WOMAN I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU A ROSE PINK SATIN DRESS ROSE PINK IS JUST YOUR SHADE AND SOME DAY WHEN WE GO OUT TOGETHER I WILL LEND YOU SOME OF MY DIAMONDS
4098-11546-0044 AFTER THIS WHIMSICAL MANNER SHE LAVISHED PRESENTS UPON HER WHENEVER SHE HAD A NEW FANCY IN TRUTH HER GENEROSITY WAS CONSTITUTIONAL AND SHE HAD BEEN GENEROUS ENOUGH TOWARD PAMELA BUT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SO EXTRAVAGANT AS SHE WAS WITH THEODORA
4098-11546-0045 THEODORA WAS AN ACTUAL BEAUTY OF AN UNCOMMON TYPE IN THE FACE OF HER IGNORANCE OF MANNERS AND CUSTOMS PAMELA HAD NEVER AT HER BEST BEEN MORE THAN A DELICATELY PRETTY GIRL IN THE MEANTIME DENIS OGLETHORPE MADE FRIENDLY CALLS AS USUAL
4098-11546-0046 AND ALWAYS MEETING THEODORA FOUND HER VERY PLEASANT TO TALK TO AND LOOK AT HE FOUND OUT HER ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRATION FOR THE POETIC EFFUSIONS OF HIS YOUTH AND IN CONSIDERATION THEREOF GOOD HUMOREDLY PRESENTED HER WITH A COPY OF THE VOLUME
4098-11546-0047 WITH SOME VERY WITTY VERSES WRITTEN ON THE FLY LEAF IN A FLOURISHING HAND IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO AMUSE THEODORA SHE WAS SO PRETTY AND UNASSUMING IN HER DELIGHT AT HIS CARELESSLY AMIABLE EFFORTS FOR HER ENTERTAINMENT
4098-11546-0048 SHE WAS ONLY A MERE CHILD AFTER ALL AT SIXTEEN WITH DOWNPORT IN THE BACKGROUND SO HE FELT QUITE HONESTLY AT EASE IN BEING ATTENTIVE TO HER GIRLISH REQUIREMENTS BETTER THAT HE SHOULD AMUSE HER
4098-11546-0049 THAN THAT SHE SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE MERCY OF MEN WHO WOULD PERHAPS HAVE THE EXECRABLE TASTE TO SPOIL HER PRETTY CHILDISH WAYS WITH FLATTERY DON'T LET ALL THESE FINE PEOPLE AND FINE SPEECHES TURN YOUR HEAD THEODORA HE WOULD SAY
4098-11546-0050 IN A TONE THAT MIGHT EITHER HAVE BEEN JEST OR EARNEST THEY SPOILED ME IN MY INFANCY AND MY UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE CAUSES ME TO WARN YOU BUT WHETHER HE JESTED OR NOT THEO WAS ALWAYS INCLINED TO LISTEN TO HIM WITH SOME DEGREE OF SERIOUS BELIEF
4098-11546-0051 SHE TOOK HIS ADVICE WHEN IT WAS PROFFERED AND REGARDED HIS WISDOM AS THE WISDOM OF AN ORACLE WHO SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN HE WHAT WAS RIGHT
4098-11546-0052 THE MOST BRILLIANT OF WITTICISMS HE PAID HER HIS FIRST COMPLIMENT THE NIGHT THE ROSE COLORED SATIN DRESS CAME HOME THEY WERE GOING TO SEE FAUST TOGETHER WITH LADY THROCKMORTON AND SHE HAD FINISHED DRESSING EARLY AND CAME DOWN TO THE DRAWING ROOM
4098-11546-0053 THE THICK LUSTROUS FOLDS OF SATIN BILLOWING UPON THE CARPET AROUND HER FEET
4098-11546-0054 HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A FAINT SHOCK OF DELIGHT ON FIRST BEHOLDING HER HE HAD JUST LEFT PRISCILLA PALE AND HEAVY EYED IN DUN COLORED MERINO PORING OVER A GREEK DICTIONARY AND THE SUDDEN ENTERING THE BRIGHT ROOM
4098-11546-0055 AND FINDING HIMSELF FACING THEODORA NORTH IN ROSE COLORED SATIN WAS A LITTLE LIKE ELECTRICITY OH IT'S THEODORA IS IT HE SAID SLOWLY WHEN HE RECOVERED HIMSELF THANK YOU THEODORA WHAT FOR ASKED THEO BLUSHING
4098-11546-0056 FOR THE ROSE COLORED SATIN HE RETURNED COMPLACENTLY IT IS SO VERY BECOMING YOU LOOK LIKE A SULTANA MY DEAR THEODORA THEO LOOKED UP AT HIM FOR A SECOND AND THEN LOOKED DOWN MUCH AS SHE ADMIRED MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE SHE NEVER QUITE COMPREHENDED HIM
4098-11546-0057 HE HAD SUCH AN ECCENTRIC FASHION OF BEING ALMOST CURT SOMETIMES SHE HAD SEEN HIM ACTUALLY GIVE A FAINT START WHEN HE ENTERED AND SHE HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD THAT
4098-11546-0058 THAT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT EITHER
4098-11546-0059 I HAVE BEEN MAKING A FINE SPEECH TO THEODORA HE SAID TO LADY THROCKMORTON WHEN SHE CAME IN AND SHE DOES NOT COMPREHEND IT IN THE LEAST
