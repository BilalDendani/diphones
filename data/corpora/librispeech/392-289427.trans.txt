392-289427-0000 THEY ENTERED WITH THE NIGHT A SULLEN HORDE SPATTERED WITH SLIME FAINT WITH HUNGER AND EXHAUSTION THERE WAS LITTLE DISORDER AT FIRST
392-289427-0001 AND THE THRONG AT THE GATES PARTED SILENTLY AS THE TROOPS TRAMPED ALONG THE FREEZING STREETS CONFUSION CAME AS THE HOURS PASSED SWIFTLY AND MORE SWIFTLY CROWDING SQUADRON AFTER SQUADRON AND BATTERY ON BATTERY

392-289427-0008 AND I'M AFRAID THAT SOME OF THE PILLAGERS MAY TAKE IT INTO THEIR HEADS TO PAY US A VISIT TO NIGHT BRAITH JUMPED OUT OF BED AND BUNDLED HIMSELF INTO A GARMENT WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN AN OVERCOAT ANYBODY HURT
392-289427-0009 HE INQUIRED STRUGGLING WITH A SLEEVE FULL OF DILAPIDATED LINING NO COLETTE IS BARRICADED IN THE CELLAR AND THE CONCIERGE RAN AWAY TO THE FORTIFICATIONS THERE WILL BE A ROUGH GANG THERE IF THE BOMBARDMENT KEEPS UP YOU MIGHT HELP US

392-289427-0020 THAT MISERLY LANDLORD OF MINE A CRASH FROM THE OUTSIDE FOLLOWED BY A YELL CUT HIM SHORT THEN BLOW AFTER BLOW SHOOK THE DOORS UNTIL THERE CAME A SHARP SNAP A CLINKING OF METAL AND A TRIANGULAR BIT OF IRON FELL INWARDS
392-289427-0021 LEAVING A HOLE THROUGH WHICH STRUGGLED A RAY OF LIGHT INSTANTLY WEST KNELT AND SHOVING HIS REVOLVER THROUGH THE APERTURE FIRED EVERY CARTRIDGE FOR A MOMENT THE ALLEY RESOUNDED WITH THE RACKET OF THE REVOLVER THEN ABSOLUTE SILENCE FOLLOWED
392-289427-0022 PRESENTLY A SINGLE QUESTIONING BLOW FELL UPON THE DOOR AND A MOMENT LATER ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND THEN A SUDDEN CRACK ZIGZAGGED ACROSS THE IRON PLATE HERE SAID WEST SEIZING COLETTE BY THE WRIST
392-289427-0023 YOU FOLLOW ME BRAITH AND HE RAN SWIFTLY TOWARD A CIRCULAR SPOT OF LIGHT AT THE FURTHER END OF THE CELLAR THE SPOT OF LIGHT CAME FROM A BARRED MAN HOLE ABOVE
392-289427-0024 PUSH IT OVER YOU MUST WITH LITTLE EFFORT BRAITH LIFTED THE BARRED COVER SCRAMBLED OUT ON HIS STOMACH AND EASILY RAISED COLETTE FROM WEST'S SHOULDERS QUICK OLD CHAP CRIED THE LATTER
392-289427-0025 BRAITH TWISTED HIS LEGS AROUND A FENCE CHAIN AND LEANED DOWN AGAIN THE CELLAR WAS FLOODED WITH A YELLOW LIGHT AND THE AIR REEKED WITH THE STENCH OF PETROLEUM TORCHES THE IRON DOOR STILL HELD BUT A WHOLE PLATE OF METAL WAS GONE
392-289427-0026 AND NOW AS THEY LOOKED A FIGURE CAME CREEPING THROUGH HOLDING A TORCH QUICK WHISPERED BRAITH JUMP AND WEST HUNG DANGLING UNTIL COLETTE GRASPED HIM BY THE COLLAR AND HE WAS DRAGGED OUT
392-289427-0027 THEN HER NERVES GAVE WAY AND SHE WEPT HYSTERICALLY BUT WEST THREW HIS ARM AROUND HER AND LED HER ACROSS THE GARDENS INTO THE NEXT STREET WHERE BRAITH AFTER REPLACING THE MAN HOLE COVER AND PILING SOME STONE SLABS FROM THE WALL OVER IT
392-289427-0028 REJOINED THEM IT WAS ALMOST DARK THEY HURRIED THROUGH THE STREET NOW ONLY LIGHTED BY BURNING BUILDINGS OR THE SWIFT GLARE OF THE SHELLS THEY GAVE WIDE BERTH TO THE FIRES
392-289427-0029 BUT AT A DISTANCE SAW THE FLITTING FORMS OF PILLAGERS AMONG THE DEBRIS SOMETIMES THEY PASSED A FEMALE FURY CRAZED WITH DRINK SHRIEKING ANATHEMAS UPON THE WORLD OR SOME SLOUCHING LOUT WHOSE BLACKENED FACE AND HANDS
392-289427-0030 BETRAYED HIS SHARE IN THE WORK OF DESTRUCTION AT LAST THEY REACHED THE SEINE AND PASSED THE BRIDGE AND THEN BRAITH SAID I MUST GO BACK I AM NOT SURE OF JACK AND SYLVIA
392-289427-0031 AS HE SPOKE HE MADE WAY FOR A CROWD WHICH CAME TRAMPLING ACROSS THE BRIDGE AND ALONG THE RIVER WALL BY THE D'ORSAY BARRACKS
392-289427-0032 A FILE OF BAYONETS THEN ANOTHER LANTERN WHICH GLIMMERED ON A DEATHLY FACE BEHIND AND COLETTE GASPED HARTMAN AND HE WAS GONE THEY PEERED FEARFULLY ACROSS THE EMBANKMENT
392-289427-0033 HOLDING THEIR BREATH THERE WAS A SHUFFLE OF FEET ON THE QUAY AND THE GATE OF THE BARRACKS SLAMMED A LANTERN SHONE FOR A MOMENT AT THE POSTERN THE CROWD PRESSED TO THE GRILLE
392-289427-0034 AND NOW THE WHOLE SQUARE WAS IN MOTION DOWN FROM THE CHAMPS ELYSEES AND ACROSS THE PLACE DE LA CONCORDE STRAGGLED THE FRAGMENTS OF THE BATTLE A COMPANY HERE AND A MOB THERE
392-289427-0035 THEY POURED IN FROM EVERY STREET FOLLOWED BY WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND A GREAT MURMUR BORNE ON THE ICY WIND SWEPT THROUGH THE ARC DE TRIOMPHE AND DOWN THE DARK AVENUE
392-289427-0036 PERDUS A RAGGED END OF A BATTALION WAS PRESSING PAST THE SPECTRE OF ANNIHILATION WEST GROANED THEN A FIGURE SPRANG FROM THE SHADOWY RANKS AND CALLED WEST'S NAME
392-289427-0037 AND WHEN HE SAW IT WAS TRENT HE CRIED OUT TRENT SEIZED HIM WHITE WITH TERROR SYLVIA WEST STARED SPEECHLESS BUT COLETTE MOANED OH SYLVIA SYLVIA
392-289427-0038 TRENT SHOUTED BRAITH BUT HE WAS GONE AND THEY COULD NOT OVERTAKE THEM
392-289427-0039 BUT THE ENTRANCE TO THE RUE DE SEINE WAS BLOCKED BY A HEAP OF SMOKING BRICKS EVERYWHERE THE SHELLS HAD TORN GREAT HOLES IN THE PAVEMENT THE CAFE WAS A WRECK OF SPLINTERS AND GLASS THE BOOK STORE TOTTERED
392-289427-0040 RIPPED FROM ROOF TO BASEMENT AND THE LITTLE BAKERY LONG SINCE CLOSED BULGED OUTWARD ABOVE A MASS OF SLATE AND TIN HE CLIMBED OVER THE STEAMING BRICKS AND HURRIED INTO THE RUE DE TOURNON
