7138-73705-0000 IN WHICH CAPTAIN ARMINE PROVES HIMSELF A COMPLETE TACTICIAN THE MIDNIGHT MOON FLUNG ITS BROAD BEAMS OVER THE GLADES AND AVENUES OF ARMINE AS FERDINAND RIDING MISS TEMPLE'S HORSE RE ENTERED THE PARK
7138-73705-0001 HE LOOKED LITTLE LIKE A PLEDGED AND TRIUMPHANT LOVER
7138-73705-0002 THAT WAS PAST HENRIETTA TEMPLE WAS THE LIGHT
7138-73705-0003 THITHER HE DIRECTED ALL THE ENERGIES OF HIS BEING AND TO GAIN THAT PORT OR SINK WAS HIS UNFLINCHING RESOLUTION IT WAS DEEP IN THE NIGHT BEFORE HE AGAIN BEHELD THE TOWERS AND TURRETS OF HIS CASTLE
7138-73705-0004 AND THE IVY COVERED FRAGMENT OF THE OLD PLACE SEEMED TO SLEEP IN PEACE UNDER ITS PROTECTING INFLUENCE A WILD AND BEAUTIFUL EVENT HAD HAPPENED SINCE LAST HE QUITTED THOSE ANCIENT WALLS
7138-73705-0005 AND WHAT WOULD BE ITS INFLUENCE UPON THEM BUT IT IS NOT FOR THE PASSIONATE LOVER TO MORALISE FOR HIM
7138-73705-0006 LOST IN THE RAVISHING AND ABSORBING PRESENT FOR A LOVER THAT HAS BUT JUST SECURED THE OBJECT OF HIS LONG AND TUMULTUOUS HOPES IS AS A DIVER WHO HAS JUST PLUCKED A JEWEL FROM THE BED OF SOME RARE SEA
7138-73705-0007 PANTING AND WILD HE LIES UPON THE BEACH AND THE GEM THAT HE CLUTCHES IS THE SOLE IDEA THAT ENGROSSES HIS EXISTENCE FERDINAND IS WITHIN HIS LITTLE CHAMBER
7138-73705-0008 THAT LITTLE CHAMBER WHERE HIS MOTHER HAD BID HIM SO PASSIONATE A FAREWELL AH HE LOVES ANOTHER WOMAN BETTER THAN HIS MOTHER NOW NAY EVEN A FEELING OF EMBARRASSMENT AND PAIN
7138-73705-0009 HE DRIVES HIS MOTHER FROM HIS THOUGHTS IT IS OF ANOTHER VOICE THAT HE NOW MUSES IT IS THE MEMORY OF ANOTHER'S GLANCE THAT TOUCHES HIS EAGER HEART HE FALLS INTO A REVERIE
7138-73705-0010 THE PASSIONATE PAST IS ACTED AGAIN BEFORE HIM IN HIS GLITTERING EYE AND THE RAPID PLAY OF HIS FEATURES MAY BE TRACED THE TUMULT OF HIS SOUL A DOUBT CROSSES HIS BROW
7138-73705-0011 WORKED IN HER OWN FINE DARK HAIR A SMILE OF TRIUMPHANT CERTAINTY IRRADIATES HIS COUNTENANCE AS HE RAPIDLY PRESSES THE MEMORIAL TO HIS LIPS AND IMPRINTS UPON IT A THOUSAND KISSES
7138-73705-0012 AND HOLDING THIS CHERISHED TESTIMONY OF HIS FELICITY TO HIS HEART SLEEP AT LENGTH DESCENDED UPON THE EXHAUSTED FRAME OF FERDINAND ARMINE
7138-73705-0013 BUT THE NIGHT THAT BROUGHT DREAMS TO FERDINAND ARMINE BROUGHT HIM NOT VISIONS MORE MARVELLOUS AND MAGICAL THAN HIS WAKING LIFE HE WHO LOVES LIVES IN AN ECSTATIC TRANCE
7138-73705-0014 THE WORLD THAT SURROUNDS HIM IS NOT THE WORLD OF WORKING MAN IT IS FAIRY LAND HE IS NOT OF THE SAME ORDER AS THE LABOURING MYRIADS ON WHICH HE SEEMS TO TREAD
7138-73705-0015 FLOWERS FOR HER WERE MADE SO SWEET AND BIRDS SO MUSICAL ALL NATURE SEEMS TO BEAR AN INTIMATE RELATION TO THE BEING WE ADORE AND AS TO US LIFE WOULD NOW APPEAR INTOLERABLE A BURTHEN OF
7138-73705-0016 INSUPPORTABLE AND WEARYING TOIL WITHOUT THIS TRANSCENDENT SYMPATHY SO WE CANNOT HELP FANCYING THAT WERE ITS SWEET AND SUBTLE ORIGIN HERSELF TO QUIT THIS INSPIRED SCENE THE UNIVERSE ITSELF WOULD NOT BE
7138-73705-0017 SUFFUSED THE SOFT AND TREMULOUS SKY
7138-73705-0018 FRESHENED WITH THE LIGHT AND VANISHING DEW THE AIR WAS VOCAL WITH A THOUSAND SONGS ALL WAS BRIGHT AND CLEAR CHEERFUL AND GOLDEN FERDINAND AWOKE FROM DELICIOUS DREAMS
7138-73705-0019 AND GAZED UPON THE SCENE THAT RESPONDED TO HIS OWN BRIGHT AND GLAD EMOTIONS
7138-73705-0020 AND GREETS THE OBJECT OF ITS FOND SOLICITUDE AMID PERFUMED GARDENS AND IN THE SHADE OF GREEN AND SILENT WOODS WHATEVER MAY BE THE HARSHER COURSE OF HIS CAREER
7138-73705-0021 HOWEVER THE COLD WORLD MAY CAST ITS DARK SHADOWS UPON HIS FUTURE PATH HE MAY YET CONSIDER HIMSELF THRICE BLESSED TO WHOM THIS GRACEFUL DESTINY HAS FALLEN AND AMID THE STORMS AND TROUBLES OF AFTER LIFE
7138-73705-0022 OPPRESSION MAY BRUISE HIS SPIRIT BUT BAULKED DAUNTED DESERTED CRUSHED
7138-73705-0023 STILL HE HAS NOT LIVED IN VAIN BUSINESS HOWEVER RISES WITH THE SUN THE MORNING BRINGS CARES
7138-73705-0024 THEN IS THE SEASON THAT WE ARE BEST QUALIFIED TO STRUGGLE WITH THE HARASSING BROOD STILL FERDINAND ARMINE THE INVOLVED SON OF A RUINED RACE SELDOM ROSE FROM HIS COUCH SELDOM RECALLED CONSCIOUSNESS AFTER REPOSE
7138-73705-0025 WITHOUT A PANG NOR WAS THERE INDEED MAGIC WITHAL IN THE SWEET SPELL THAT NOW BOUND HIM TO PRESERVE HIM FROM THIS BLACK INVASION
7138-73705-0026 HE MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN HIS OWN BROKEN FORTUNES
7138-73705-0027 AS BRAVE AS THAT OF ARMINE BUT THE VERY INSPIRING RECOLLECTION OF HENRIETTA TEMPLE THE VERY REMEMBRANCE OF THE PAST AND TRIUMPHANT EVE
7138-73705-0028 MISS GRANDISON MIGHT ARRIVE THIS VERY DAY IT WAS AN IMPROBABLE INCIDENT BUT STILL IT MIGHT OCCUR WHILE HE WAS THUS MUSING HIS SERVANT BROUGHT HIM HIS LETTERS WHICH HAD ARRIVED THE PRECEDING DAY
7138-73705-0029 LETTERS FROM HIS MOTHER AND KATHERINE HIS KATHERINE THEY BROUGHT PRESENT RELIEF THE INVALID HAD NOT AMENDED THEIR MOVEMENTS WERE STILL UNCERTAIN KATHERINE HIS OWN KATE
7138-73705-0030 THAT HE WOULD INSTANTLY FLY TO HER ONLY THAT HE DAILY EXPECTED HIS ATTENDANCE WOULD BE REQUIRED IN TOWN ON MILITARY BUSINESS OF URGENT IMPORTANCE TO THEIR HAPPINESS THIS MIGHT THIS MUST NECESSARILY DELAY THEIR MEETING
7138-73705-0031 HE SHOULD HURRY OFF IN THE MEANTIME
7138-73705-0032 HE HAD A FAITHFUL SERVANT AN ITALIAN IN WHOSE DISCRETION HE HAD JUSTLY UNLIMITED CONFIDENCE TO HIM FERDINAND INTRUSTED THE DUTY OF BRINGING EACH DAY HIS LETTERS TO HIS RETREAT WHICH HE HAD FIXED UPON SHOULD BE
7138-73705-0033 THAT SAME PICTURESQUE FARM HOUSE IN WHOSE FRIENDLY PORCH HE HAD FOUND THE PRECEDING DAY SUCH A HOSPITABLE SHELTER
