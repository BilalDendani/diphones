2574-128278-0020 BUT MAN HIMSELF ONLY IS HARD TO BEAR THE REASON THEREOF IS THAT HE CARRIETH TOO MANY EXTRANEOUS THINGS ON HIS SHOULDERS LIKE THE CAMEL KNEELETH HE DOWN AND LETTETH HIMSELF BE WELL LADEN
2574-128278-0021 ESPECIALLY THE STRONG LOAD BEARING MAN IN WHOM REVERENCE RESIDETH TOO MANY EXTRANEOUS HEAVY WORDS AND WORTHS LOADETH HE UPON HIMSELF THEN SEEMETH LIFE TO HIM A DESERT
2574-128278-0022 AND VERILY MANY A THING ALSO THAT IS OUR OWN IS HARD TO BEAR AND MANY INTERNAL THINGS IN MAN ARE LIKE THE OYSTER REPULSIVE AND SLIPPERY AND HARD TO GRASP
2574-128278-0023 WITH ELEGANT ADORNMENT MUST PLEAD FOR THEM
2574-128278-0024 TO HAVE A SHELL AND A FINE APPEARANCE AND SAGACIOUS BLINDNESS AGAIN IT DECEIVETH ABOUT MANY THINGS IN MAN THAT MANY A SHELL IS POOR AND PITIABLE AND TOO MUCH OF A SHELL
