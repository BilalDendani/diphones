1365-134804-0000 CHAPTER FIVE VAGUE FLASHES ON THE HORIZON LITTLE BY LITTLE AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME ALL THIS OPPOSITION SUBSIDED
1365-134804-0001 AND TOWARDS EIGHTEEN TWENTY ONE THE MOMENT ARRIVED WHEN THE WORD MONSIEUR LE MAIRE
1365-134804-0002 HE PUT AN END TO DIFFERENCES HE PREVENTED LAWSUITS HE RECONCILED ENEMIES EVERY ONE TOOK HIM FOR THE JUDGE AND WITH GOOD REASON IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HE HAD FOR A SOUL THE BOOK OF THE NATURAL LAW IT WAS LIKE AN EPIDEMIC OF VENERATION
1365-134804-0003 WHICH IN THE COURSE OF SIX OR SEVEN YEARS GRADUALLY TOOK POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE DISTRICT ONE SINGLE MAN IN THE TOWN IN THE ARRONDISSEMENT ABSOLUTELY ESCAPED THIS CONTAGION AND WHATEVER FATHER MADELEINE DID
1365-134804-0004 REMAINED HIS OPPONENT AS THOUGH A SORT OF INCORRUPTIBLE AND IMPERTURBABLE INSTINCT KEPT HIM ON THE ALERT AND UNEASY IT SEEMS IN FACT
1365-134804-0005 THOUGH PURE AND UPRIGHT LIKE ALL INSTINCTS WHICH CREATES ANTIPATHIES AND SYMPATHIES WHICH FATALLY SEPARATES ONE NATURE FROM ANOTHER NATURE WHICH DOES NOT HESITATE WHICH FEELS NO DISQUIET
1365-134804-0006 INFALLIBLE IMPERIOUS INTRACTABLE STUBBORN TO ALL COUNSELS OF THE INTELLIGENCE AND TO ALL THE DISSOLVENTS OF REASON AND WHICH IN WHATEVER MANNER DESTINIES ARE ARRANGED SECRETLY WARNS THE MAN DOG OF THE PRESENCE OF THE MAN CAT
1365-134804-0007 AND THE MAN FOX OF THE PRESENCE OF THE MAN LION
1365-134804-0008 CALM AFFECTIONATE SURROUNDED BY THE BLESSINGS OF ALL A MAN OF LOFTY STATURE CLAD IN AN IRON GRAY FROCK COAT ARMED WITH A HEAVY CANE AND WEARING A BATTERED HAT TURNED ROUND ABRUPTLY BEHIND HIM AND FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES UNTIL HE DISAPPEARED
1365-134804-0009 WITH FOLDED ARMS AND A SLOW SHAKE OF THE HEAD AND HIS UPPER LIP RAISED IN COMPANY WITH HIS LOWER TO HIS NOSE A SORT OF SIGNIFICANT GRIMACE WHICH MIGHT BE TRANSLATED BY WHAT IS THAT MAN AFTER ALL
1365-134804-0010 I CERTAINLY HAVE SEEN HIM SOMEWHERE IN ANY CASE I AM NOT HIS DUPE THIS PERSON GRAVE WITH A GRAVITY WHICH WAS ALMOST MENACING WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO
1365-134804-0011 EVEN WHEN ONLY SEEN BY A RAPID GLIMPSE ARREST THE SPECTATOR'S ATTENTION HIS NAME WAS JAVERT AND HE BELONGED TO THE POLICE
1365-134804-0012 HE HAD NOT SEEN MADELEINE'S BEGINNINGS JAVERT OWED THE POST WHICH HE OCCUPIED TO THE PROTECTION OF
1365-134804-0013 THEN PREFECT OF POLICE AT PARIS
1365-134804-0014 THE FORTUNE OF THE GREAT MANUFACTURER WAS ALREADY MADE AND FATHER MADELEINE HAD BECOME MONSIEUR MADELEINE CERTAIN POLICE OFFICERS HAVE A PECULIAR PHYSIOGNOMY WHICH IS COMPLICATED WITH AN AIR OF BASENESS MINGLED WITH AN AIR OF AUTHORITY
1365-134804-0015 MINUS THE BASENESS IT IS OUR CONVICTION THAT IF SOULS WERE VISIBLE TO THE EYES WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE DISTINCTLY THAT STRANGE THING THAT EACH ONE INDIVIDUAL OF THE HUMAN RACE CORRESPONDS TO SOME ONE OF THE SPECIES OF THE ANIMAL CREATION
1365-134804-0016 AND WE COULD EASILY RECOGNIZE THIS TRUTH HARDLY PERCEIVED BY THE THINKER THAT FROM THE OYSTER TO THE EAGLE FROM THE PIG TO THE TIGER ALL ANIMALS EXIST IN MAN AND THAT EACH ONE OF THEM IS IN A MAN
1365-134804-0017 THAT IS TO SAY THE POSSIBILITY OF EDUCATION SOCIAL EDUCATION WHEN WELL DONE CAN ALWAYS DRAW FROM A SOUL OF WHATEVER SORT IT MAY BE THE UTILITY WHICH IT CONTAINS THIS BE IT SAID
1365-134804-0018 IS OF COURSE FROM THE RESTRICTED POINT OF VIEW OF THE TERRESTRIAL LIFE WHICH IS APPARENT AND WITHOUT PREJUDGING THE PROFOUND QUESTION OF THE ANTERIOR OR ULTERIOR PERSONALITY OF THE BEINGS WHICH ARE NOT MAN THE VISIBLE I
1365-134804-0019 HAVING MADE THIS RESERVATION LET US PASS ON NOW IF THE READER WILL ADMIT FOR A MOMENT WITH US THAT IN EVERY MAN THERE IS ONE OF THE ANIMAL SPECIES OF CREATION
1365-134804-0020 WHICH IS KILLED BY THE MOTHER BECAUSE OTHERWISE AS HE GREW UP HE WOULD DEVOUR THE OTHER LITTLE ONES GIVE TO THIS DOG SON OF A WOLF A HUMAN FACE AND THE RESULT WILL BE JAVERT JAVERT HAD BEEN BORN IN PRISON OF A FORTUNE TELLER
1365-134804-0021 AND HE DESPAIRED OF EVER RE ENTERING IT HE OBSERVED THAT SOCIETY UNPARDONINGLY EXCLUDES TWO CLASSES OF MEN THOSE WHO ATTACK IT AND THOSE WHO GUARD IT HE HAD NO CHOICE EXCEPT BETWEEN THESE TWO CLASSES
1365-134804-0022 AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF AN INDESCRIBABLE FOUNDATION OF RIGIDITY REGULARITY AND PROBITY COMPLICATED WITH AN INEXPRESSIBLE HATRED FOR THE RACE OF BOHEMIANS WHENCE HE WAS SPRUNG HE ENTERED THE POLICE
1365-134804-0023 HE SUCCEEDED THERE AT FORTY YEARS OF AGE HE WAS AN INSPECTOR DURING HIS YOUTH HE HAD BEEN EMPLOYED IN THE CONVICT ESTABLISHMENTS OF THE SOUTH BEFORE PROCEEDING FURTHER
1365-134804-0024 HUMAN FACE WHICH WE HAVE JUST APPLIED TO JAVERT THE HUMAN FACE OF JAVERT CONSISTED OF A FLAT NOSE WITH TWO DEEP NOSTRILS TOWARDS WHICH ENORMOUS WHISKERS ASCENDED ON HIS CHEEKS
1365-134804-0025 BUT HIS GUMS AND AROUND HIS NOSE THERE FORMED A FLATTENED AND SAVAGE FOLD AS ON THE MUZZLE OF A WILD BEAST JAVERT SERIOUS WAS A WATCHDOG
1365-134804-0026 AS FOR THE REST HE HAD VERY LITTLE SKULL AND A GREAT DEAL OF JAW HIS HAIR CONCEALED HIS FOREHEAD AND FELL OVER HIS EYEBROWS BETWEEN HIS EYES THERE WAS A PERMANENT CENTRAL FROWN LIKE AN IMPRINT OF WRATH HIS GAZE WAS OBSCURE
1365-134804-0027 HIS MOUTH PURSED UP AND TERRIBLE HIS AIR THAT OF FEROCIOUS COMMAND THIS MAN WAS COMPOSED OF TWO VERY SIMPLE AND TWO VERY GOOD SENTIMENTS COMPARATIVELY BUT HE RENDERED THEM ALMOST BAD BY DINT OF EXAGGERATING THEM
1365-134804-0028 RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY HATRED OF REBELLION AND IN HIS EYES MURDER ROBBERY ALL CRIMES ARE ONLY FORMS OF REBELLION HE ENVELOPED IN A BLIND AND PROFOUND FAITH EVERY ONE WHO HAD A FUNCTION IN THE STATE
1365-134804-0029 FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO THE RURAL POLICEMAN HE COVERED WITH SCORN AVERSION AND DISGUST EVERY ONE WHO HAD ONCE CROSSED THE LEGAL THRESHOLD OF EVIL HE WAS ABSOLUTE AND ADMITTED NO EXCEPTIONS ON THE ONE HAND HE SAID
1365-134804-0030 THE FUNCTIONARY CAN MAKE NO MISTAKE THE MAGISTRATE IS NEVER THE WRONG ON THE OTHER HAND HE SAID THESE MEN ARE IRREMEDIABLY LOST NOTHING GOOD CAN COME FROM THEM
1365-134804-0031 HE FULLY SHARED THE OPINION OF THOSE EXTREME MINDS WHICH ATTRIBUTE TO HUMAN LAW I KNOW NOT WHAT POWER OF MAKING OR IF THE READER WILL HAVE IT SO OF AUTHENTICATING DEMONS AND WHO PLACE A STYX AT THE BASE OF SOCIETY
1365-134804-0032 HE WAS STOICAL SERIOUS AUSTERE A MELANCHOLY DREAMER HUMBLE AND HAUGHTY LIKE FANATICS HIS GLANCE WAS LIKE A GIMLET COLD AND PIERCING HIS WHOLE LIFE HUNG ON THESE TWO WORDS WATCHFULNESS
1365-134804-0033 AND SUPERVISION HE HAD INTRODUCED A STRAIGHT LINE INTO WHAT IS THE MOST CROOKED THING IN THE WORLD HE POSSESSED THE CONSCIENCE OF HIS USEFULNESS THE RELIGION OF HIS FUNCTIONS AND HE WAS A SPY AS OTHER MEN ARE PRIESTS
1365-134804-0034 WOE TO THE MAN WHO FELL INTO HIS HANDS HE WOULD HAVE ARRESTED HIS OWN FATHER IF THE LATTER HAD ESCAPED FROM THE GALLEYS AND WOULD HAVE DENOUNCED HIS MOTHER IF SHE HAD BROKEN HER BAN AND HE WOULD HAVE DONE IT WITH THAT SORT OF INWARD SATISFACTION WHICH IS CONFERRED BY VIRTUE
1365-134804-0035 AND WITHAL A LIFE OF PRIVATION ISOLATION ABNEGATION CHASTITY WITH NEVER A DIVERSION IT WAS IMPLACABLE DUTY THE POLICE UNDERSTOOD AS THE SPARTANS UNDERSTOOD SPARTA A PITILESS LYING IN WAIT
1365-134804-0036 A FEROCIOUS HONESTY A MARBLE INFORMER BRUTUS IN VIDOCQ JAVERT'S WHOLE PERSON WAS EXPRESSIVE OF THE MAN WHO SPIES AND WHO WITHDRAWS HIMSELF FROM OBSERVATION
1365-134804-0037 WOULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO DECLARE THAT JAVERT WAS A SYMBOL HIS BROW WAS NOT VISIBLE IT DISAPPEARED BENEATH HIS HAT HIS EYES WERE NOT VISIBLE SINCE THEY WERE LOST UNDER HIS EYEBROWS HIS CHIN WAS NOT VISIBLE
1365-134804-0038 HIS HANDS WERE NOT VISIBLE THEY WERE DRAWN UP IN HIS SLEEVES AND HIS CANE WAS NOT VISIBLE HE CARRIED IT UNDER HIS COAT BUT WHEN THE OCCASION PRESENTED ITSELF THERE WAS SUDDENLY SEEN TO EMERGE FROM ALL THIS SHADOW AS FROM AN AMBUSCADE
1365-134804-0039 THIS CAUSED HIM TO BE NOT WHOLLY ILLITERATE THIS COULD BE RECOGNIZED BY SOME EMPHASIS IN HIS SPEECH AS WE HAVE SAID HE HAD NO VICES WHEN HE WAS PLEASED WITH HIMSELF HE PERMITTED HIMSELF A PINCH OF SNUFF
1365-134804-0040 AN EYE FULL OF SUSPICION AND CONJECTURE
1365-134804-0041 ALL THE ANTERIOR TRACES WHICH FATHER MADELEINE MIGHT HAVE LEFT ELSEWHERE HE SEEMED TO KNOW AND HE SOMETIMES SAID IN COVERT WORDS THAT SOME ONE HAD GLEANED CERTAIN INFORMATION IN A CERTAIN DISTRICT ABOUT A FAMILY WHICH HAD DISAPPEARED
1365-134804-0042 ONCE HE CHANCED TO SAY AS HE WAS TALKING TO HIMSELF I THINK I HAVE HIM THEN HE REMAINED PENSIVE FOR THREE DAYS AND UTTERED NOT A WORD IT SEEMED THAT THE THREAD WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HELD HAD BROKEN MOREOVER
1365-134804-0043 AND THIS FURNISHES THE NECESSARY CORRECTIVE FOR THE TOO ABSOLUTE SENSE WHICH CERTAIN WORDS MIGHT PRESENT THERE CAN BE NOTHING REALLY INFALLIBLE IN A HUMAN CREATURE AND THE PECULIARITY OF INSTINCT IS THAT IT CAN BECOME CONFUSED THROWN OFF THE TRACK AND DEFEATED
1365-134804-0044 ONE DAY NEVERTHELESS
