8012-273138-0009 CAN WE SEND THE CHILD BACK TO THE ASYLUM I SUPPOSE THEY'LL TAKE HER BACK WON'T THEY I SUPPOSE SO SAID MISSUS SPENCER THOUGHTFULLY BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO SEND HER BACK MISSUS PETER BLEWETT WAS UP HERE YESTERDAY
8012-273138-0010 AND SHE FINDS IT HARD TO GET HELP ANNE WILL BE THE VERY GIRL FOR YOU I CALL IT POSITIVELY PROVIDENTIAL MARILLA DID NOT LOOK AS IF SHE THOUGHT PROVIDENCE HAD MUCH TO DO WITH THE MATTER
8012-273138-0011 AND SHE DID NOT EVEN FEEL GRATEFUL FOR IT SHE KNEW MISSUS PETER BLEWETT ONLY BY SIGHT AS A SMALL SHREWISH FACED WOMAN
8012-273138-0012 BUT SHE HAD HEARD OF HER A TERRIBLE WORKER AND DRIVER MISSUS PETER WAS SAID TO BE AND DISCHARGED SERVANT GIRLS TOLD FEARSOME TALES OF HER TEMPER AND STINGINESS
8012-273138-0013 AND HER FAMILY OF PERT QUARRELSOME CHILDREN MARILLA FELT A QUALM OF CONSCIENCE AT THE THOUGHT OF HANDING ANNE OVER TO HER TENDER MERCIES
8012-273138-0014 EXCLAIMED MISSUS SPENCER BUSTLING HER GUESTS THROUGH THE HALL INTO THE PARLOR WHERE A DEADLY CHILL STRUCK ON THEM
8012-273138-0015 AS IF THE AIR HAD BEEN STRAINED SO LONG THROUGH DARK GREEN CLOSELY DRAWN BLINDS THAT IT HAD LOST EVERY PARTICLE OF WARMTH IT HAD EVER POSSESSED
8012-273138-0016 TAKE THE ARMCHAIR MISS CUTHBERT ANNE YOU SIT HERE ON THE OTTOMAN AND DON'T WIGGLE
8012-273138-0017 GOOD AFTERNOON MISSUS BLEWETT WE WERE JUST SAYING HOW FORTUNATE
8012-273138-0018 WITH HER HANDS CLASPED TIGHTLY IN HER LAP STARED AT MISSUS BLEWETT AS ONE FASCINATED WAS SHE TO BE GIVEN INTO THE KEEPING OF THIS SHARP FACED SHARP EYED WOMAN SHE FELT A LUMP COMING UP IN HER THROAT
8012-273138-0019 SHE WAS BEGINNING TO BE AFRAID SHE COULDN'T KEEP THE TEARS BACK WHEN MISSUS SPENCER RETURNED FLUSHED AND BEAMING QUITE CAPABLE OF TAKING ANY AND EVERY DIFFICULTY PHYSICAL MENTAL OR SPIRITUAL INTO CONSIDERATION AND SETTLING IT OUT OF HAND
8012-273138-0020 IT SEEMS THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE ABOUT THIS LITTLE GIRL MISSUS BLEWETT SHE SAID I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT MISTER AND MISS CUTHBERT WANTED A LITTLE GIRL TO ADOPT
8012-273138-0021 MISSUS BLEWETT DARTED HER EYES OVER ANNE FROM HEAD TO FOOT HOW OLD ARE YOU AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME SHE DEMANDED ANNE SHIRLEY FALTERED THE SHRINKING CHILD NOT DARING TO MAKE ANY
8012-273138-0022 STIPULATIONS REGARDING THE SPELLING THEREOF AND I'M ELEVEN YEARS OLD HUMPH
8012-273138-0023 GOOD AND SMART AND RESPECTFUL I'LL EXPECT YOU TO EARN YOUR KEEP AND NO MISTAKE ABOUT THAT YES I SUPPOSE I MIGHT AS WELL TAKE HER OFF YOUR HANDS MISS CUTHBERT THE BABY'S AWFUL FRACTIOUS
8012-273138-0024 AND I'M CLEAN WORN OUT ATTENDING TO HIM
8012-273138-0025 AND SOFTENED AT SIGHT OF THE CHILD'S PALE FACE WITH ITS LOOK OF MUTE MISERY THE MISERY OF A HELPLESS LITTLE CREATURE WHO FINDS ITSELF ONCE MORE
8012-273138-0026 IF SHE DENIED THE APPEAL OF THAT LOOK IT WOULD HAUNT HER TO HER DYING DAY MORE OVER SHE DID NOT FANCY MISSUS BLEWETT TO HAND A SENSITIVE HIGHSTRUNG CHILD OVER TO SUCH A WOMAN
8012-273138-0027 NO SHE COULD NOT TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DOING THAT WELL
8012-273138-0028 I DIDN'T SAY THAT MATTHEW AND I HAD ABSOLUTELY DECIDED THAT WE WOULDN'T KEEP HER IN FACT I MAY SAY THAT MATTHEW IS DISPOSED TO KEEP HER I JUST CAME OVER TO FIND OUT HOW THE MISTAKE HAD OCCURRED I THINK I'D BETTER TAKE HER HOME AGAIN AND TALK IT OVER WITH MATTHEW
8012-273138-0029 IF WE MAKE UP OUR MIND NOT TO KEEP HER WE'LL BRING OR SEND HER OVER TO YOU TOMORROW NIGHT IF WE DON'T YOU MAY KNOW THAT SHE IS GOING TO STAY WITH US WILL THAT SUIT YOU MISSUS BLEWETT
8012-273138-0030 UNGRACIOUSLY DURING MARILLA'S SPEECH A SUNRISE HAD BEEN DAWNING ON ANNE'S FACE FIRST THE LOOK OF DESPAIR FADED OUT THEN CAME A FAINT FLUSH OF HOPE HER EYES GREW DEEP AND BRIGHT AS MORNING STARS THE CHILD WAS QUITE TRANSFIGURED
8012-273138-0031 WENT OUT IN QUEST OF A RECIPE THE LATTER HAD COME TO BORROW SHE SPRANG UP AND FLEW ACROSS THE ROOM TO MARILLA
8012-273138-0032 SHE SAID IN A BREATHLESS WHISPER AS IF SPEAKING ALOUD MIGHT SHATTER THE GLORIOUS POSSIBILITY DID YOU REALLY SAY IT OR DID I ONLY IMAGINE THAT YOU DID I THINK YOU'D BETTER LEARN TO CONTROL THAT IMAGINATION OF YOURS ANNE
8012-273138-0033 IF YOU CAN'T DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT ISN'T SAID MARILLA CROSSLY
8012-273138-0034 SAID ANNE PASSIONATELY SHE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE A LIKE A GIMLET MARILLA SMOTHERED A SMILE UNDER THE CONVICTION THAT ANNE MUST BE REPROVED FOR SUCH A SPEECH
8012-273138-0035 A LITTLE GIRL LIKE YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF TALKING SO ABOUT A LADY AND A STRANGER SHE SAID SEVERELY GO BACK AND SIT DOWN QUIETLY AND HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND BEHAVE AS A GOOD GIRL SHOULD
8012-273138-0036 IF YOU'LL ONLY KEEP ME SAID ANNE RETURNING MEEKLY TO HER OTTOMAN WHEN THEY ARRIVED BACK AT GREEN GABLES THAT EVENING MATTHEW MET THEM IN THE LANE MARILLA FROM AFAR HAD NOTED HIM PROWLING ALONG IT AND GUESSED HIS MOTIVE
8012-273138-0037 SHE WAS PREPARED FOR THE RELIEF SHE READ IN HIS FACE
8012-273138-0038 BUT SHE SAID NOTHING TO HIM RELATIVE TO THE AFFAIR UNTIL THEY WERE BOTH OUT IN THE YARD BEHIND THE BARN MILKING THE COWS THEN SHE BRIEFLY TOLD HIM ANNE'S HISTORY AND THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW WITH MISSUS SPENCER I WOULDN'T GIVE A DOG I LIKED TO THAT BLEWETT WOMAN
8012-273138-0039 SAID MATTHEW WITH UNUSUAL VIM I DON'T FANCY HER STYLE MYSELF ADMITTED MARILLA BUT IT'S THAT OR KEEPING HER OURSELVES MATTHEW
8012-273138-0040 I'VE BEEN THINKING OVER THE IDEA
8012-273138-0041 I'VE NEVER BROUGHT UP A CHILD ESPECIALLY A GIRL AND I DARE SAY I'LL MAKE A TERRIBLE MESS OF IT BUT I'LL DO MY BEST SO FAR AS I'M CONCERNED MATTHEW SHE MAY STAY MATTHEW'S SHY FACE WAS A GLOW OF DELIGHT
8012-273138-0042 IT'D BE MORE TO THE POINT IF YOU COULD SAY SHE WAS A USEFUL LITTLE THING RETORTED MARILLA BUT I'LL MAKE IT MY BUSINESS TO SEE SHE'S TRAINED TO BE THAT AND MIND MATTHEW YOU'RE NOT TO GO INTERFERING WITH MY METHODS
8012-273138-0043 SO YOU JUST LEAVE ME TO MANAGE HER WHEN I FAIL IT'LL BE TIME ENOUGH TO PUT YOUR OAR IN
8012-273138-0044 ONLY BE AS GOOD AND KIND TO HER AS YOU CAN WITHOUT SPOILING HER I KIND OF THINK SHE'S ONE OF THE SORT YOU CAN DO ANYTHING WITH IF YOU ONLY GET HER TO LOVE YOU
8012-273138-0045 AND WALKED OFF TO THE DAIRY WITH THE PAILS
8012-273138-0046 SHE REFLECTED AS SHE STRAINED THE MILK INTO THE CREAMERS
8012-273138-0047 MARILLA CUTHBERT YOU'RE FAIRLY IN FOR IT DID YOU EVER SUPPOSE YOU'D SEE THE DAY WHEN YOU'D BE ADOPTING AN ORPHAN GIRL IT'S SURPRISING ENOUGH
