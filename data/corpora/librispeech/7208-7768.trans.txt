7208-7768-0000 WHICH DOES NOT ADMIT OF A CONSECUTIVE HISTORY AND THE RESULTS OF WHICH IF REAL WILL BE BEST FOUND IN MY WRITINGS I SHALL THEREFORE GREATLY ABRIDGE THE CHRONICLE OF MY SUBSEQUENT YEARS
7208-7768-0001 THE FIRST USE I MADE OF THE LEISURE WHICH I GAINED BY DISCONNECTING MYSELF FROM THE REVIEW WAS TO FINISH THE LOGIC IN JULY AND AUGUST EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT
7208-7768-0002 I HAD FOUND AN INTERVAL IN WHICH TO EXECUTE WHAT WAS STILL UNDONE OF THE ORIGINAL DRAFT OF THE THIRD BOOK IN WORKING OUT THE LOGICAL THEORY OF THOSE LAWS OF NATURE
7208-7768-0003 WHICH ARE NOT LAWS OF CAUSATION NOR COROLLARIES FROM SUCH LAWS I WAS LED TO RECOGNIZE KINDS AS REALITIES IN NATURE AND NOT MERE DISTINCTIONS FOR CONVENIENCE
7208-7768-0004 A LIGHT WHICH I HAD NOT OBTAINED WHEN THE FIRST BOOK WAS WRITTEN AND WHICH MADE IT NECESSARY FOR ME TO MODIFY AND ENLARGE SEVERAL CHAPTERS OF THAT BOOK THE BOOK ON LANGUAGE AND CLASSIFICATION
7208-7768-0005 AND THE CHAPTER ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF FALLACIES WERE DRAFTED IN THE AUTUMN OF THE SAME YEAR THE REMAINDER OF THE WORK IN THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN FORTY FROM APRIL FOLLOWING TO THE END OF EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE
7208-7768-0006 MY SPARE TIME WAS DEVOTED TO A COMPLETE REWRITING OF THE BOOK FROM ITS COMMENCEMENT IT IS IN THIS WAY THAT ALL MY BOOKS HAVE BEEN COMPOSED THEY WERE ALWAYS WRITTEN AT LEAST TWICE OVER
7208-7768-0007 WHICH APPEARED AS SUITABLE TO MY PURPOSE AS ANYTHING WHICH I COULD WRITE IN LIEU OF THEM I HAVE FOUND GREAT ADVANTAGES IN THIS SYSTEM OF DOUBLE REDACTION IT COMBINES BETTER THAN ANY OTHER MODE OF COMPOSITION
7208-7768-0008 AND THE SUBSTANCE OF ALL THAT I FIND TO SAY HAS IN SOME MANNER HOWEVER IMPERFECT BEEN GOT UPON PAPER
7208-7768-0009 IS THE ARRANGEMENT IF THAT IS BAD THE WHOLE THREAD ON WHICH THE IDEAS STRING THEMSELVES BECOMES TWISTED THOUGHTS PLACED IN A WRONG CONNECTION ARE NOT EXPOUNDED IN A MANNER THAT SUITS THE RIGHT
7208-7768-0010 AND A FIRST DRAFT WITH THIS ORIGINAL VICE IS NEXT TO USELESS AS A FOUNDATION FOR THE FINAL TREATMENT DURING THE RE WRITING OF THE LOGIC DOCTOR WHEWELL'S PHILOSOPHY OF THE INDUCTIVE SCIENCES MADE ITS APPEARANCE
7208-7768-0011 OR CONFRONTING THEM DISTINCTLY WITH AN OPPOSITE THEORY THE CONTROVERSIES WITH DOCTOR WHEWELL AS WELL AS MUCH MATTER DERIVED FROM COMTE WERE FIRST INTRODUCED INTO THE BOOK IN THE COURSE OF THE RE WRITING
7208-7768-0012 FOR REASONS WHICH COULD JUST AS WELL HAVE BEEN GIVEN AT FIRST
7208-7768-0013 BY WHOM IT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN FORTY THREE MY ORIGINAL EXPECTATIONS OF SUCCESS WERE EXTREMELY LIMITED ARCHBISHOP WHATELY HAD
7208-7768-0014 IN THE OTHER PART OF MY SUBJECT THE THEORY OF INDUCTION A TREATISE HOWEVER ON A MATTER SO ABSTRACT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO BE POPULAR
7208-7768-0015 BUT ADDICTED CHIEFLY TO THE OPPOSITE SCHOOL OF METAPHYSICS THE ONTOLOGICAL AND INNATE PRINCIPLES SCHOOL I THEREFORE DID NOT EXPECT THAT THE BOOK WOULD HAVE MANY READERS OR APPROVERS
7208-7768-0016 AND LOOKED FOR LITTLE PRACTICAL EFFECT FROM IT SAVE THAT OF KEEPING THE TRADITION UNBROKEN OF WHAT I THOUGHT A BETTER PHILOSOPHY WHAT HOPES I HAD OF EXCITING ANY IMMEDIATE ATTENTION
7208-7768-0017 EIGHTEEN FIFTY JUST IN TIME FOR ME TO ANSWER HIM IN THE THIRD EDITION HOW THE BOOK CAME TO HAVE FOR A WORK OF THE KIND
7208-7768-0018 I WILL NOT VENTURE TO SAY READ IT I HAVE NEVER THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD
7208-7768-0019 OR ANY POSSIBLE CANONS OF EVIDENCE CAN DO BY THEMSELVES TOWARDS
7208-7768-0020 COMBINED WITH OTHER REQUISITES I CERTAINLY DO THINK THEM OF GREAT USE BUT WHATEVER MAY BE THE PRACTICAL VALUE OF A TRUE PHILOSOPHY OF THESE MATTERS IT IS HARDLY POSSIBLE TO EXAGGERATE THE MISCHIEFS OF A FALSE ONE
7208-7768-0021 IS ENABLED TO DISPENSE WITH THE OBLIGATION OF JUSTIFYING ITSELF BY REASON AND IS ERECTED INTO ITS OWN ALL SUFFICIENT VOUCHER AND JUSTIFICATION
7208-7768-0022 THERE NEVER WAS SUCH AN INSTRUMENT DEVISED FOR CONSECRATING ALL DEEP SEATED PREJUDICES AND THE CHIEF STRENGTH OF THIS FALSE PHILOSOPHY IN MORALS POLITICS AND RELIGION LIES IN THE APPEAL
7208-7768-0023 ON THE WHOLE THE BEST OF THE ARGUMENT IN ATTEMPTING TO CLEAR UP THE REAL NATURE OF THE EVIDENCE OF MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL TRUTHS
7208-7768-0024 ON GROUND ON WHICH THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN DEEMED UNASSAILABLE AND GAVE ITS OWN EXPLANATION FROM EXPERIENCE AND ASSOCIATION
7208-7768-0025 OF THAT PECULIAR CHARACTER OF WHAT ARE CALLED NECESSARY TRUTHS WHICH IS ADDUCED AS PROOF THAT THEIR EVIDENCE MUST COME FROM A DEEPER SOURCE THAN EXPERIENCE
7208-7768-0026 WHETHER THIS HAS BEEN DONE EFFECTUALLY IS STILL SUB JUDICE AND EVEN THEN TO DEPRIVE A MODE OF THOUGHT SO STRONGLY ROOTED IN HUMAN PREJUDICES AND PARTIALITIES OF ITS MERE SPECULATIVE SUPPORT
7208-7768-0027 AND FROM ANY LITERARY OCCUPATION INVOLVING PERSONAL COMMUNICATION WITH CONTRIBUTORS AND OTHERS I WAS ENABLED TO INDULGE THE INCLINATION
7208-7768-0028 FOR LIMITING MY OWN SOCIETY TO A VERY FEW PERSONS GENERAL SOCIETY AS NOW CARRIED ON IN ENGLAND IS SO INSIPID AN AFFAIR EVEN TO THE PERSONS WHO MAKE IT WHAT IT IS
7208-7768-0029 THAT IT IS KEPT UP FOR ANY REASON RATHER THAN THE PLEASURE IT AFFORDS ALL SERIOUS DISCUSSION ON MATTERS ON WHICH OPINIONS DIFFER
7208-7768-0030 BEING CONSIDERED ILL BRED AND THE NATIONAL DEFICIENCY IN LIVELINESS AND SOCIABILITY HAVING PREVENTED THE CULTIVATION OF THE ART OF TALKING AGREEABLY ON TRIFLES
7208-7768-0031 TO A PERSON OF ANY BUT A VERY COMMON ORDER IN THOUGHT OR FEELING SUCH SOCIETY UNLESS HE HAS PERSONAL OBJECTS TO SERVE BY IT MUST BE SUPREMELY UNATTRACTIVE AND MOST PEOPLE IN THE PRESENT DAY
7208-7768-0032 OF ANY REALLY HIGH CLASS OF INTELLECT MAKE THEIR CONTACT WITH IT SO SLIGHT AND AT SUCH LONG INTERVALS AS TO BE ALMOST CONSIDERED AS RETIRING FROM IT ALTOGETHER
7208-7768-0033 THEY BECOME LESS IN EARNEST ABOUT THOSE OF THEIR OPINIONS RESPECTING WHICH THEY MUST REMAIN SILENT IN THE SOCIETY THEY FREQUENT THEY COME TO LOOK UPON THEIR MOST ELEVATED OBJECTS AS UNPRACTICAL
7208-7768-0034 OR AT LEAST TOO REMOTE FROM REALIZATION TO BE MORE THAN A VISION OR A THEORY AND IF MORE FORTUNATE THAN MOST THEY RETAIN THEIR HIGHER PRINCIPLES UNIMPAIRED
7208-7768-0035 YET WITH RESPECT TO THE PERSONS AND AFFAIRS OF THEIR OWN DAY
7208-7768-0036 YET HE IS THE ONLY PERSON WITH HIGH OBJECTS WHO CAN SAFELY ENTER IT AT ALL PERSONS EVEN OF INTELLECTUAL ASPIRATIONS HAD MUCH BETTER IF THEY CAN
7208-7768-0037 MAKE THEIR HABITUAL ASSOCIATES OF AT LEAST THEIR EQUALS AND AS FAR AS POSSIBLE THEIR SUPERIORS IN KNOWLEDGE INTELLECT AND ELEVATION OF SENTIMENT MOREOVER IF THE CHARACTER IS FORMED
7208-7768-0038 AND THE MIND MADE UP ON THE FEW CARDINAL POINTS OF HUMAN OPINION AGREEMENT OF CONVICTION AND FEELING ON THESE HAS BEEN FELT IN ALL TIMES TO BE AN ESSENTIAL REQUISITE OF ANYTHING WORTHY THE NAME OF FRIENDSHIP
7208-7768-0039 IN A REALLY EARNEST MIND ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES UNITED MADE THE NUMBER VERY SMALL OF THOSE WHOSE SOCIETY AND STILL MORE WHOSE INTIMACY I NOW VOLUNTARILY SOUGHT
7208-7768-0040 AMONG THESE BY FAR THE PRINCIPAL WAS THE INCOMPARABLE FRIEND OF WHOM I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN AT THIS PERIOD SHE LIVED MOSTLY WITH ONE YOUNG DAUGHTER IN A QUIET PART OF THE COUNTRY
7208-7768-0041 LIABLE TO BE PUT ON THE FREQUENCY OF MY VISITS TO HER WHILE LIVING GENERALLY APART FROM MISTER TAYLOR AND ON OUR OCCASIONALLY TRAVELLING TOGETHER
7208-7768-0042 THOUGH IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS OUR CONDUCT DURING THOSE YEARS GAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST GROUND FOR ANY OTHER SUPPOSITION THAN THE TRUE ONE THAT OUR RELATION TO EACH OTHER AT THAT TIME
7208-7768-0043 WAS ONE OF STRONG AFFECTION AND CONFIDENTIAL INTIMACY ONLY FOR THOUGH WE DID NOT CONSIDER THE ORDINANCES OF SOCIETY BINDING ON A SUBJECT SO ENTIRELY PERSONAL
7208-7768-0044 WE DID FEEL BOUND THAT OUR CONDUCT SHOULD BE SUCH AS IN NO DEGREE TO BRING DISCREDIT ON HER HUSBAND NOR THEREFORE ON HERSELF
7208-7768-0045 OF MY MENTAL PROGRESS WHICH NOW WENT HAND IN HAND WITH HERS MY OPINIONS GAINED EQUALLY IN BREADTH AND DEPTH I UNDERSTOOD MORE THINGS AND THOSE WHICH I HAD UNDERSTOOD BEFORE
7208-7768-0046 I HAD NOW COMPLETELY TURNED BACK FROM WHAT THERE HAD BEEN OF EXCESS IN MY REACTION AGAINST BENTHAMISM I HAD AT THE HEIGHT OF THAT REACTION
7208-7768-0047 CERTAINLY BECOME MUCH MORE INDULGENT TO THE COMMON OPINIONS OF SOCIETY AND THE WORLD AND MORE WILLING TO BE CONTENT WITH SECONDING THE SUPERFICIAL IMPROVEMENT
7208-7768-0048 THE ASSERTION OF WHICH TENDS IN ANY WAY TO REGENERATE SOCIETY BUT IN ADDITION TO THIS OUR OPINIONS WERE FAR MORE HERETICAL THAN MINE HAD BEEN IN THE DAYS OF MY MOST EXTREME BENTHAMISM
7208-7768-0049 IN THOSE DAYS I HAD SEEN LITTLE FURTHER THAN THE OLD SCHOOL OF POLITICAL ECONOMISTS INTO THE POSSIBILITIES OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPROVEMENT IN SOCIAL ARRANGEMENTS PRIVATE PROPERTY AS NOW UNDERSTOOD
7208-7768-0050 THE NOTION THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO GO FURTHER THAN THIS IN REMOVING THE INJUSTICE FOR INJUSTICE IT IS
7208-7768-0051 WHETHER ADMITTING OF A COMPLETE REMEDY OR NOT INVOLVED IN THE FACT THAT SOME ARE BORN TO RICHES AND THE VAST MAJORITY TO POVERTY I THEN RECKONED CHIMERICAL
7208-7768-0052 BUT NOT THE LEAST OF A SOCIALIST WE WERE NOW MUCH LESS DEMOCRATS THAN I HAD BEEN BECAUSE SO LONG AS EDUCATION CONTINUES TO BE SO WRETCHEDLY IMPERFECT
7208-7768-0053 WE DREADED THE IGNORANCE AND ESPECIALLY THE SELFISHNESS AND BRUTALITY OF THE MASS BUT OUR IDEAL OF ULTIMATE IMPROVEMENT WENT FAR BEYOND DEMOCRACY
7208-7768-0054 INSTEAD OF DEPENDING AS IN SO GREAT A DEGREE IT NOW DOES ON THE ACCIDENT OF BIRTH WILL BE MADE BY CONCERT ON AN ACKNOWLEDGED PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE
7208-7768-0055 AND WHEN IT WILL NO LONGER EITHER BE OR BE THOUGHT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HUMAN BEINGS TO EXERT THEMSELVES STRENUOUSLY IN PROCURING BENEFITS WHICH ARE NOT TO BE EXCLUSIVELY THEIR OWN
7208-7768-0056 BUT TO BE SHARED WITH THE SOCIETY THEY BELONG TO THE SOCIAL PROBLEM OF THE FUTURE WE CONSIDERED TO BE HOW TO UNITE THE GREATEST INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY OF ACTION WITH A COMMON OWNERSHIP IN THE RAW MATERIAL OF THE GLOBE
7208-7768-0057 WE SAW CLEARLY THAT TO RENDER ANY SUCH SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION EITHER POSSIBLE OR DESIRABLE AN EQUIVALENT CHANGE OF CHARACTER MUST TAKE PLACE BOTH IN THE UNCULTIVATED HERD
7208-7768-0058 WHO NOW COMPOSE THE LABOURING MASSES AND IN THE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF THEIR EMPLOYERS BOTH THESE CLASSES MUST LEARN BY PRACTICE TO LABOUR AND COMBINE FOR GENEROUS
7208-7768-0059 OR AT ALL EVENTS FOR PUBLIC AND SOCIAL PURPOSES AND NOT AS HITHERTO SOLELY FOR NARROWLY INTERESTED ONES BUT THE CAPACITY TO DO THIS HAS ALWAYS EXISTED IN MANKIND AND IS NOT NOR
7208-7768-0060 IS EVER LIKELY TO BE EXTINCT EDUCATION HABIT AND THE CULTIVATION OF THE SENTIMENTS WILL MAKE A COMMON MAN DIG OR WEAVE FOR HIS COUNTRY AS READILY AS FIGHT FOR HIS COUNTRY
7208-7768-0061 BUT THE HINDRANCE IS NOT IN THE ESSENTIAL CONSTITUTION OF HUMAN NATURE INTEREST IN THE COMMON GOOD IS AT PRESENT SO WEAK A MOTIVE IN THE GENERALITY NOT BECAUSE IT CAN NEVER BE OTHERWISE
7208-7768-0062 AS ONLY SELF INTEREST NOW IS BY THE DAILY COURSE OF LIFE AND SPURRED FROM BEHIND BY THE LOVE OF DISTINCTION AND THE FEAR OF SHAME IT IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING EVEN IN COMMON MEN
7208-7768-0063 THE MOST STRENUOUS EXERTIONS AS WELL AS THE MOST HEROIC SACRIFICES THE DEEP ROOTED SELFISHNESS WHICH FORMS THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE EXISTING STATE OF SOCIETY IS SO DEEPLY ROOTED
7208-7768-0064 ONLY BECAUSE THE WHOLE COURSE OF EXISTING INSTITUTIONS TENDS TO FOSTER IT AND MODERN INSTITUTIONS IN SOME RESPECTS MORE THAN ANCIENT
7208-7768-0065 ARE FAR LESS FREQUENT IN MODERN LIFE THAN THE SMALLER COMMONWEALTHS OF ANTIQUITY THESE CONSIDERATIONS DID NOT MAKE US OVERLOOK THE FOLLY OF
7208-7768-0066 PREMATURE ATTEMPTS TO DISPENSE WITH THE INDUCEMENTS OF PRIVATE INTEREST IN SOCIAL AFFAIRS WHILE NO SUBSTITUTE FOR THEM HAS BEEN OR CAN BE PROVIDED
7208-7768-0067 BUT WE REGARDED ALL EXISTING INSTITUTIONS AND SOCIAL ARRANGEMENTS AS BEING IN A PHRASE I ONCE HEARD FROM AUSTIN MERELY PROVISIONAL AND WE WELCOMED WITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE
7208-7768-0068 AND INTEREST ALL SOCIALISTIC EXPERIMENTS BY SELECT INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS THE CO OPERATIVE SOCIETIES WHICH WHETHER THEY SUCCEEDED OR FAILED COULD NOT BUT OPERATE AS A MOST USEFUL EDUCATION
7208-7768-0069 IN THE PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL ECONOMY THESE OPINIONS WERE PROMULGATED LESS CLEARLY AND FULLY IN THE FIRST EDITION RATHER MORE SO IN THE SECOND
7208-7768-0070 ON THE WHOLE RANGE OF TOPICS INVOLVED IN THE CONTROVERSY AND THE RESULT WAS THAT MOST OF WHAT HAD BEEN WRITTEN ON THE SUBJECT IN THE FIRST EDITION WAS CANCELLED AND REPLACED BY ARGUMENTS AND REFLECTIONS
7208-7768-0071 TO IMMEDIATE DESTITUTION WITH PERMANENT IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMICAL CONDITION OF THE IRISH PEOPLE BUT THE IDEA WAS NEW AND STRANGE
7208-7768-0072 THERE WAS NO ENGLISH PRECEDENT FOR SUCH A PROCEEDING AND THE PROFOUND IGNORANCE OF ENGLISH POLITICIANS AND THE ENGLISH PUBLIC CONCERNING ALL SOCIAL PHENOMENA NOT GENERALLY MET WITH IN ENGLAND
7208-7768-0073 HOWEVER COMMON ELSEWHERE MADE MY ENDEAVOURS AN ENTIRE FAILURE INSTEAD OF A GREAT OPERATION ON THE WASTE LANDS AND THE CONVERSION OF COTTIERS INTO PROPRIETORS
7208-7768-0074 PARLIAMENT PASSED A POOR LAW FOR MAINTAINING THEM AS PAUPERS AND IF THE NATION HAS NOT SINCE FOUND ITSELF IN INEXTRICABLE DIFFICULTIES FROM THE JOINT OPERATION OF THE OLD EVILS AND THE QUACK REMEDY
7208-7768-0075 IT IS INDEBTED FOR ITS DELIVERANCE TO THAT MOST UNEXPECTED AND SURPRISING FACT THE DEPOPULATION OF IRELAND COMMENCED BY FAMINE
