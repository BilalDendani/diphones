2085-147970-0000 WHEN SPRING CAME AFTER THAT HARD WINTER ONE COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF THE NIMBLE AIR EVERY MORNING I WAKENED WITH A FRESH CONSCIOUSNESS THAT WINTER WAS OVER THERE WERE NONE OF THE SIGNS OF SPRING FOR WHICH I USED TO WATCH IN VIRGINIA NO BUDDING WOODS OR BLOOMING GARDENS
2085-147970-0001 THERE WAS ONLY SPRING ITSELF THE THROB OF IT THE LIGHT RESTLESSNESS
2085-147970-0002 RISING SUDDENLY SINKING SUDDENLY IMPULSIVE AND PLAYFUL LIKE A BIG PUPPY THAT PAWED YOU AND THEN LAY DOWN TO BE PETTED IF I HAD BEEN TOSSED DOWN BLINDFOLD ON THAT RED PRAIRIE I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT IT WAS SPRING EVERYWHERE NOW THERE WAS THE SMELL OF BURNING GRASS
2085-147970-0003 OUR NEIGHBORS BURNED OFF THEIR PASTURE BEFORE THE NEW GRASS MADE A START SO THAT THE FRESH GROWTH WOULD NOT BE MIXED WITH THE DEAD STAND OF LAST YEAR THOSE LIGHT SWIFT FIRES RUNNING ABOUT THE COUNTRY SEEMED A PART OF THE SAME KINDLING THAT WAS IN THE AIR
2085-147970-0004 THE SHIMERDAS WERE IN THEIR NEW LOG HOUSE BY THEN THE NEIGHBORS HAD HELPED THEM TO BUILD IT IN MARCH IT STOOD DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEIR OLD CAVE WHICH THEY USED AS A CELLAR THE FAMILY WERE NOW FAIRLY EQUIPPED TO BEGIN THEIR STRUGGLE WITH THE SOIL
2085-147970-0005 THEY HAD FOUR COMFORTABLE ROOMS TO LIVE IN A NEW WINDMILL BOUGHT ON CREDIT A CHICKEN HOUSE AND POULTRY MISSUS SHIMERDA HAD PAID GRANDFATHER TEN DOLLARS FOR A MILK COW AND WAS TO GIVE HIM FIFTEEN MORE AS SOON AS THEY HARVESTED THEIR FIRST CROP
2085-147970-0006 WHEN I RODE UP TO THE SHIMERDAS ONE BRIGHT WINDY AFTERNOON IN APRIL YULKA RAN OUT TO MEET ME IT WAS TO HER NOW THAT I GAVE READING LESSONS ANTONIA WAS BUSY WITH OTHER THINGS
2085-147970-0007 I TIED MY PONY AND WENT INTO THE KITCHEN WHERE MISSUS SHIMERDA WAS BAKING BREAD CHEWING POPPY SEEDS AS SHE WORKED BY THIS TIME SHE COULD SPEAK ENOUGH ENGLISH TO ASK ME A GREAT MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT OUR MEN WERE DOING IN THE FIELDS
2085-147970-0008 SHE SEEMED TO THINK THAT MY ELDERS WITHHELD HELPFUL INFORMATION AND THAT FROM ME SHE MIGHT GET VALUABLE SECRETS ON THIS OCCASION SHE ASKED ME VERY CRAFTILY WHEN GRANDFATHER EXPECTED TO BEGIN PLANTING CORN
2085-147970-0009 I TOLD HER ADDING THAT HE THOUGHT WE SHOULD HAVE A DRY SPRING AND THAT THE CORN WOULD NOT BE HELD BACK BY TOO MUCH RAIN AS IT HAD BEEN LAST YEAR SHE GAVE ME A SHREWD GLANCE HE NOT JESUS SHE BLUSTERED HE NOT KNOW ABOUT THE WET
2085-147970-0010 AND THE DRY I DID NOT ANSWER HER WHAT WAS THE USE AS I SAT WAITING FOR THE HOUR WHEN AMBROSCH AND ANTONIA WOULD RETURN FROM THE FIELDS I WATCHED MISSUS SHIMERDA AT HER WORK SHE TOOK FROM THE OVEN A COFFEE CAKE WHICH SHE WANTED TO KEEP WARM FOR SUPPER
2085-147970-0011 AND WRAPPED IT IN A QUILT STUFFED WITH FEATHERS I HAVE SEEN HER PUT EVEN A ROAST GOOSE IN THIS QUILT TO KEEP IT HOT WHEN THE NEIGHBORS WERE THERE BUILDING THE NEW HOUSE THEY SAW HER DO THIS AND THE STORY GOT ABROAD THAT THE SHIMERDAS KEPT THEIR FOOD IN THEIR FEATHER BEDS
