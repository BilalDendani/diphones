4490-16002-0008 COURAGEOUS AS A THINKER UNEASY ONLY IN THE FACE OF THE CHANCES OF A EUROPEAN SHAKING UP AND UNFITTED FOR GREAT POLITICAL ADVENTURES ALWAYS READY TO RISK HIS LIFE NEVER HIS WORK
4490-16002-0009 AS AN INTELLIGENCE RATHER THAN AS A KING ENDOWED WITH OBSERVATION AND NOT WITH DIVINATION NOT VERY ATTENTIVE TO MINDS BUT KNOWING MEN THAT IS TO SAY REQUIRING TO SEE IN ORDER TO JUDGE
4490-16002-0010 PROMPT AND PENETRATING GOOD SENSE PRACTICAL WISDOM EASY SPEECH PRODIGIOUS MEMORY DRAWING INCESSANTLY ON THIS MEMORY HIS ONLY POINT OF RESEMBLANCE WITH CAESAR ALEXANDER AND NAPOLEON
4490-16002-0011 KNOWING DEEDS FACTS DETAILS DATES PROPER NAMES IGNORANT OF TENDENCIES PASSIONS THE DIVERSE GENIUSES OF THE CROWD THE INTERIOR ASPIRATIONS THE HIDDEN AND OBSCURE UPRISINGS OF SOULS IN A WORD
4490-16002-0012 ALL THAT CAN BE DESIGNATED AS THE INVISIBLE CURRENTS OF CONSCIENCES ACCEPTED BY THE SURFACE BUT LITTLE IN ACCORD WITH FRANCE LOWER DOWN EXTRICATING HIMSELF BY DINT OF TACT GOVERNING TOO MUCH AND NOT ENOUGH
4490-16002-0013 AN INDESCRIBABLE SPIRIT OF PROCEEDINGS AND CHICANERY THE FOUNDER AND LAWYER OF A DYNASTY HAVING SOMETHING OF CHARLEMAGNE AND SOMETHING OF AN ATTORNEY IN SHORT A LOFTY AND ORIGINAL FIGURE A PRINCE WHO UNDERSTOOD
4490-16002-0014 AND WOULD BE RANKED AMONG THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS GOVERNORS OF HISTORY HAD HE LOVED GLORY BUT A LITTLE AND IF HE HAD HAD THE SENTIMENT OF WHAT IS GREAT TO THE SAME DEGREE AS THE FEELING FOR WHAT IS USEFUL
4490-16002-0015 HE WORE THE UNIFORM OF THE NATIONAL GUARD
4490-16002-0016 AND THE RIBBON OF THE LEGION OF HONOR LIKE NAPOLEON HE WENT A LITTLE TO CHAPEL NOT AT ALL TO THE CHASE NEVER TO THE OPERA
4490-16002-0017 HE WAS A BIT OF A MASON A BIT OF A GARDENER SOMETHING OF A DOCTOR HE BLED A POSTILION WHO HAD TUMBLED FROM HIS HORSE LOUIS PHILIPPE NO MORE WENT ABOUT WITHOUT HIS LANCET THAN DID
4490-16002-0018 THE ROYALISTS JEERED AT THIS RIDICULOUS KING THE FIRST WHO HAD EVER SHED BLOOD
4490-16002-0019 MILITARY EXECUTION OF INSURRECTIONS THE RISING PASSED OVER BY ARMS THE RUE TRANSNONAIN THE COUNSELS OF WAR THE ABSORPTION OF THE REAL COUNTRY BY THE LEGAL COUNTRY ON HALF SHARES WITH THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PRIVILEGED PERSONS
4490-16002-0020 THESE ARE THE DEEDS OF ROYALTY BELGIUM REFUSED ALGERIA TOO HARSHLY CONQUERED AND AS IN THE CASE OF INDIA BY THE ENGLISH WITH MORE BARBARISM THAN CIVILIZATION
4490-16002-0021 DEUTZ BOUGHT PRITCHARD PAID THESE ARE THE DOINGS OF THE REIGN THE POLICY WHICH WAS MORE DOMESTIC THAN NATIONAL WAS THE DOING OF THE KING AS WILL BE SEEN THE PROPER DEDUCTION HAVING BEEN MADE
4490-16002-0022 THE KING'S CHARGE IS DECREASED THIS IS HIS GREAT FAULT HE WAS MODEST IN THE NAME OF FRANCE WHENCE ARISES THIS FAULT
4490-16002-0023 TOO MUCH OF A PATERNAL KING THAT INCUBATION OF A FAMILY
4490-16002-0024 MOREOVER IF WE DEDUCT THE PUBLIC DUTIES WHICH REQUIRE TO BE FULFILLED FIRST OF ALL THAT DEEP TENDERNESS OF LOUIS PHILIPPE TOWARDS HIS FAMILY WAS DESERVED BY THE FAMILY THAT DOMESTIC GROUP WAS WORTHY OF ADMIRATION
4490-16002-0025 FROM METTERNICH THIS EULOGIUM THEY ARE YOUNG PEOPLE SUCH AS ARE RARELY SEEN AND PRINCES SUCH AS ARE NEVER SEEN THIS WITHOUT ANY DISSIMULATION AND ALSO WITHOUT ANY EXAGGERATION
4490-16002-0026 TO HAVE THAT DISQUIETING SIDE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WHICH BECOMES REASSURING IN GOVERNING POWER THEREIN LAY THE FORTUNE OF LOUIS PHILIPPE IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NEVER WAS THERE A MORE COMPLETE ADAPTATION OF A MAN TO AN EVENT
4490-16002-0027 THE ONE ENTERED INTO THE OTHER AND THE INCARNATION TOOK PLACE LOUIS PHILIPPE IS EIGHTEEN THIRTY MADE MAN MOREOVER HE HAD IN HIS FAVOR THAT GREAT RECOMMENDATION TO THE THRONE EXILE
4490-16002-0028 HE GAVE LESSONS IN MATHEMATICS WHILE HIS SISTER ADELAIDE DID WOOL WORK AND SEWED THESE SOUVENIRS CONNECTED WITH A KING RENDERED THE BOURGEOISIE ENTHUSIASTIC
4490-16002-0029 THE BLIND CLAIRVOYANCE OF THE REVOLUTION BREAKING ROYALTY IN THE KING AND THE KING WITH ROYALTY DID SO ALMOST WITHOUT NOTICING THE MAN IN THE FIERCE CRUSHING OF THE IDEA THE VAST STORM OF THE ASSEMBLY TRIBUNAL
4490-16002-0030 HE HAD LOOKED ON THOSE THINGS HE HAD CONTEMPLATED THAT GIDDINESS HE HAD SEEN THE CENTURIES APPEAR BEFORE THE BAR OF THE ASSEMBLY CONVENTION HE HAD BEHELD
4490-16002-0031 THE MONARCHY RISE THROUGH THE SHADOWS AND THERE HAD LINGERED IN HIS SOUL THE RESPECTFUL FEAR OF THESE IMMENSE JUSTICES OF THE POPULACE WHICH ARE ALMOST AS IMPERSONAL AS THE JUSTICE OF GOD
4490-16002-0032 THE TRACE LEFT IN HIM BY THE REVOLUTION WAS PRODIGIOUS ITS MEMORY WAS LIKE A LIVING IMPRINT OF THOSE GREAT YEARS MINUTE BY MINUTE ONE DAY IN THE PRESENCE OF A WITNESS WHOM WE ARE NOT PERMITTED TO DOUBT
4490-16002-0033 HE RECTIFIED FROM MEMORY THE WHOLE OF THE LETTER A IN THE ALPHABETICAL LIST OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
4490-16002-0034 WHILE HE REIGNED THE PRESS WAS FREE THE TRIBUNE WAS FREE CONSCIENCE AND SPEECH WERE FREE THE LAWS OF SEPTEMBER ARE OPEN TO SIGHT ALTHOUGH FULLY AWARE OF THE GNAWING POWER OF LIGHT ON PRIVILEGES
4490-16002-0035 THE AUSTERE AND ILLUSTRIOUS HISTORIAN LOUIS BLANC HAS HIMSELF RECENTLY SOFTENED HIS FIRST VERDICT
4490-16002-0036 TAKEN IN HIMSELF AND FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF HUMAN GOODNESS WILL REMAIN TO USE THE ANTIQUE LANGUAGE OF ANCIENT HISTORY ONE OF THE BEST PRINCES WHO EVER SAT ON A THRONE WHAT IS THERE AGAINST HIM THAT THRONE
4490-16002-0037 THERE REMAINS THE MAN AND THE MAN IS GOOD HE IS GOOD AT TIMES EVEN TO THE POINT OF BEING ADMIRABLE OFTEN IN THE MIDST OF HIS GRAVEST SOUVENIRS AFTER A DAY OF CONFLICT WITH THE WHOLE DIPLOMACY OF THE CONTINENT
4490-16002-0038 HE RETURNED AT NIGHT TO HIS APARTMENTS AND THERE EXHAUSTED WITH FATIGUE OVERWHELMED WITH SLEEP WHAT DID HE DO HE TOOK A DEATH SENTENCE AND PASSED THE NIGHT IN REVISING A CRIMINAL SUIT
4490-16002-0039 IT WAS ANGUISH TO HIM TO ABANDON THESE MISERABLE CONDEMNED HEADS ONE DAY HE SAID TO THE SAME WITNESS TO WHOM WE HAVE RECENTLY REFERRED I WON SEVEN LAST NIGHT DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF HIS REIGN
4490-16002-0040 THE DEATH PENALTY WAS AS GOOD AS ABOLISHED AND THE ERECTION OF A SCAFFOLD WAS A VIOLENCE COMMITTED AGAINST THE KING
4490-16002-0041 PRACTICAL MEN FELT THE NECESSITY OF A QUASI LEGITIMATE GUILLOTINE AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE VICTORIES OF CASIMIR PERIER WHO REPRESENTED THE NARROW SIDES OF THE BOURGEOISIE OVER LOUIS PHILIPPE WHO REPRESENTED ITS LIBERAL SIDES
4490-16002-0042 LOUIS PHILIPPE ANNOTATED BECCARIA WITH HIS OWN HAND AFTER THE FIESCHI MACHINE HE EXCLAIMED WHAT A PITY THAT I WAS NOT WOUNDED THEN I MIGHT HAVE PARDONED ON ANOTHER OCCASION ALLUDING TO THE RESISTANCE OFFERED BY HIS MINISTRY
4490-16002-0043 WHERE KINDNESS IS THE RAREST OF PEARLS THE MAN WHO IS KINDLY ALMOST TAKES PRECEDENCE OF THE MAN WHO IS GREAT LOUIS PHILIPPE HAVING BEEN SEVERELY JUDGED BY SOME HARSHLY PERHAPS BY OTHERS
4490-16002-0044 IS EVIDENTLY AND ABOVE ALL THINGS ENTIRELY DISINTERESTED AN EPITAPH PENNED BY A DEAD MAN IS SINCERE
