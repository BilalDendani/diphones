7228-98202-0000 WITH MY HEAD FULL OF GEORGE BARNWELL I WAS AT FIRST DISPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT I MUST HAVE HAD SOME HAND IN THE ATTACK UPON MY SISTER OR AT ALL EVENTS THAT AS HER NEAR RELATION POPULARLY KNOWN TO BE UNDER OBLIGATIONS TO HER
7228-98202-0001 I WAS A MORE LEGITIMATE OBJECT OF SUSPICION THAN ANY ONE ELSE BUT WHEN IN THE CLEARER LIGHT OF NEXT MORNING I BEGAN TO RECONSIDER THE MATTER AND TO HEAR IT DISCUSSED AROUND ME ON ALL SIDES
7228-98202-0002 I TOOK ANOTHER VIEW OF THE CASE WHICH WAS MORE REASONABLE JOE HAD BEEN AT THE THREE JOLLY BARGEMEN SMOKING HIS PIPE FROM A QUARTER AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK TO A QUARTER BEFORE TEN
7228-98202-0003 WHILE HE WAS THERE MY SISTER HAD BEEN SEEN STANDING AT THE KITCHEN DOOR AND HAD EXCHANGED GOOD NIGHT WITH A FARM LABORER GOING HOME
7228-98202-0004 HE GOT INTO DENSE CONFUSION WHEN HE TRIED TO BE
7228-98202-0005 WHEN JOE WENT HOME AT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE TEN HE FOUND HER STRUCK DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND PROMPTLY CALLED IN ASSISTANCE THE FIRE HAD NOT THEN BURNT UNUSUALLY LOW NOR WAS THE SNUFF OF THE CANDLE VERY LONG
7228-98202-0006 THE CANDLE HOWEVER HAD BEEN BLOWN OUT NOTHING HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM ANY PART OF THE HOUSE NEITHER BEYOND THE BLOWING OUT OF THE CANDLE
7228-98202-0007 WAS THERE ANY DISARRANGEMENT OF THE KITCHEN EXCEPTING SUCH AS SHE HERSELF HAD MADE IN FALLING AND BLEEDING BUT THERE WAS ONE REMARKABLE PIECE OF EVIDENCE ON THE SPOT SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK WITH SOMETHING BLUNT AND HEAVY ON THE HEAD AND SPINE
7228-98202-0008 AFTER THE BLOWS WERE DEALT SOMETHING HEAVY HAD BEEN THROWN DOWN AT HER WITH CONSIDERABLE VIOLENCE AS SHE LAY ON HER FACE AND ON THE GROUND BESIDE HER WHEN JOE PICKED HER UP WAS A CONVICT'S LEG IRON WHICH HAD BEEN FILED ASUNDER
7228-98202-0009 NOW JOE EXAMINING THIS IRON WITH A SMITH'S EYE
7228-98202-0010 THE HUE AND CRY GOING OFF TO THE HULKS AND PEOPLE COMING THENCE TO EXAMINE THE IRON JOE'S OPINION WAS CORROBORATED THEY DID NOT UNDERTAKE TO SAY WHEN IT HAD LEFT THE PRISON SHIPS TO WHICH IT UNDOUBTEDLY HAD ONCE BELONGED BUT THEY CLAIMED TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN
7228-98202-0011 FURTHER ONE OF THOSE TWO WAS ALREADY RETAKEN AND HAD NOT FREED HIMSELF OF HIS IRON
7228-98202-0012 I BELIEVED THE IRON TO BE MY CONVICT'S IRON THE IRON I HAD SEEN AND HEARD HIM FILING AT ON THE MARSHES BUT MY MIND DID NOT ACCUSE HIM OF HAVING PUT IT TO ITS LATEST USE FOR I BELIEVED ONE OF TWO OTHER PERSONS TO HAVE BECOME POSSESSED OF IT
7228-98202-0013 AND TO HAVE TURNED IT TO THIS CRUEL ACCOUNT EITHER ORLICK OR THE STRANGE MAN WHO HAD SHOWN ME THE FILE NOW AS TO ORLICK HE HAD GONE TO TOWN EXACTLY AS HE TOLD US WHEN WE PICKED HIM UP AT THE TURNPIKE
7228-98202-0014 HE HAD BEEN SEEN ABOUT TOWN ALL THE EVENING HE HAD BEEN IN DIVERS COMPANIES IN SEVERAL PUBLIC HOUSES AND HE HAD COME BACK WITH MYSELF AND MISTER WOPSLE THERE WAS NOTHING AGAINST HIM SAVE THE QUARREL
7228-98202-0015 TEN THOUSAND TIMES AS TO THE STRANGE MAN
7228-98202-0016 BECAUSE MY SISTER WAS FULLY PREPARED TO RESTORE THEM
7228-98202-0017 THE ASSAILANT HAD COME IN SO SILENTLY AND SUDDENLY THAT SHE HAD BEEN FELLED BEFORE SHE COULD LOOK ROUND
7228-98202-0018 BUT I COULD HARDLY THINK OTHERWISE I SUFFERED UNSPEAKABLE TROUBLE WHILE I CONSIDERED AND RECONSIDERED WHETHER I SHOULD AT LAST DISSOLVE THAT SPELL OF MY CHILDHOOD AND TELL JOE ALL THE STORY
7228-98202-0019 FOR MONTHS AFTERWARDS I EVERY DAY SETTLED THE QUESTION FINALLY IN THE NEGATIVE AND REOPENED AND REARGUED IT NEXT MORNING THE CONTENTION CAME AFTER ALL TO THIS THE SECRET WAS SUCH AN OLD ONE NOW
7228-98202-0020 HAD SO GROWN INTO ME AND BECOME A PART OF MYSELF
7228-98202-0021 TO ALIENATE JOE FROM ME IF HE BELIEVED IT I HAD A FURTHER RESTRAINING DREAD THAT HE WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT BUT WOULD ASSORT IT WITH THE FABULOUS DOGS AND VEAL CUTLETS AS A MONSTROUS INVENTION HOWEVER I TEMPORIZED WITH MYSELF OF COURSE
7228-98202-0022 WHEN THE THING IS ALWAYS DONE AND RESOLVED TO MAKE A FULL DISCLOSURE IF I SHOULD SEE ANY SUCH NEW OCCASION AS A NEW CHANCE OF HELPING IN THE DISCOVERY OF THE ASSAILANT THE CONSTABLES AND THE BOW STREET MEN FROM LONDON
7228-98202-0023 FOR THIS HAPPENED IN THE DAYS OF THE EXTINCT RED WAISTCOATED POLICE WERE ABOUT THE HOUSE FOR A WEEK OR TWO AND DID PRETTY MUCH WHAT I HAVE HEARD AND READ OF LIKE AUTHORITIES DOING IN OTHER SUCH CASES THEY TOOK UP SEVERAL OBVIOUSLY WRONG PEOPLE
7228-98202-0024 AND THEY RAN THEIR HEADS VERY HARD AGAINST WRONG IDEAS AND PERSISTED IN TRYING TO FIT THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO THE IDEAS INSTEAD OF TRYING TO EXTRACT IDEAS FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCES ALSO THEY STOOD ABOUT THE DOOR OF THE JOLLY BARGEMEN
7228-98202-0025 WITH KNOWING AND RESERVED LOOKS THAT FILLED THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH ADMIRATION AND THEY HAD A MYSTERIOUS MANNER OF TAKING THEIR DRINK THAT WAS ALMOST AS GOOD AS TAKING THE CULPRIT
7228-98202-0026 BUT NOT QUITE FOR THEY NEVER DID IT LONG AFTER THESE CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS HAD DISPERSED MY SISTER LAY VERY ILL IN BED HER SIGHT WAS DISTURBED SO THAT SHE SAW OBJECTS MULTIPLIED
7228-98202-0027 AND GRASPED AT VISIONARY TEACUPS AND WINEGLASSES INSTEAD OF THE REALITIES HER HEARING WAS GREATLY IMPAIRED HER MEMORY ALSO AND HER SPEECH WAS UNINTELLIGIBLE
7228-98202-0028 WHEN AT LAST SHE CAME ROUND SO FAR AS TO BE HELPED DOWN STAIRS IT WAS STILL NECESSARY TO KEEP MY SLATE ALWAYS BY HER THAT SHE MIGHT INDICATE IN WRITING WHAT SHE COULD NOT INDICATE IN SPEECH AS SHE WAS VERY BAD HANDWRITING APART
7228-98202-0029 A MORE THAN INDIFFERENT SPELLER AND AS JOE WAS A MORE THAN INDIFFERENT READER EXTRAORDINARY COMPLICATIONS AROSE BETWEEN THEM WHICH I WAS ALWAYS CALLED IN TO SOLVE THE ADMINISTRATION OF MUTTON INSTEAD OF MEDICINE
7228-98202-0030 THE SUBSTITUTION OF TEA FOR JOE AND THE BAKER FOR BACON WERE AMONG THE MILDEST OF MY OWN MISTAKES HOWEVER HER TEMPER WAS GREATLY IMPROVED AND SHE WAS PATIENT
7228-98202-0031 SOON BECAME A PART OF HER REGULAR STATE AND AFTERWARDS AT INTERVALS OF TWO OR THREE MONTHS SHE WOULD OFTEN PUT HER HANDS TO HER HEAD AND WOULD THEN REMAIN FOR ABOUT A WEEK AT A TIME IN SOME GLOOMY ABERRATION OF MIND
7228-98202-0032 MISTER WOPSLE'S GREAT AUNT CONQUERED A CONFIRMED HABIT OF LIVING INTO WHICH SHE HAD FALLEN AND BIDDY BECAME A PART OF OUR ESTABLISHMENT IT MAY HAVE BEEN ABOUT A MONTH AFTER MY SISTER'S REAPPEARANCE IN THE KITCHEN
7228-98202-0033 WHEN BIDDY CAME TO US WITH A SMALL SPECKLED BOX CONTAINING THE WHOLE OF HER WORLDLY EFFECTS AND BECAME A BLESSING TO THE HOUSEHOLD ABOVE ALL SHE WAS A BLESSING TO JOE FOR THE DEAR OLD FELLOW WAS SADLY CUT UP
7228-98202-0034 BY THE CONSTANT CONTEMPLATION OF THE WRECK OF HIS WIFE AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED WHILE ATTENDING ON HER OF AN EVENING TO TURN TO ME EVERY NOW AND THEN AND SAY WITH HIS BLUE EYES MOISTENED SUCH A FINE FIGURE OF A WOMAN AS SHE ONCE WERE PIP
7228-98202-0035 BIDDY INSTANTLY TAKING THE CLEVEREST CHARGE OF HER AS THOUGH SHE HAD STUDIED HER FROM INFANCY JOE BECAME ABLE IN SOME SORT TO APPRECIATE THE GREATER QUIET OF HIS LIFE AND TO GET DOWN TO THE JOLLY BARGEMEN NOW AND THEN FOR A CHANGE THAT DID HIM GOOD
7228-98202-0036 POOR JOE THOUGH HE NEVER KNEW IT
7228-98202-0037 IN REGARDING HIM AS ONE OF THE DEEPEST SPIRITS THEY HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED BIDDY'S FIRST TRIUMPH IN HER NEW OFFICE WAS TO SOLVE A DIFFICULTY THAT HAD COMPLETELY VANQUISHED ME I HAD TRIED HARD AT IT BUT HAD MADE NOTHING OF IT THUS IT WAS
7228-98202-0038 AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN MY SISTER HAD TRACED UPON THE SLATE A CHARACTER THAT LOOKED LIKE A CURIOUS T AND THEN WITH THE UTMOST EAGERNESS HAD CALLED OUR ATTENTION TO IT
7228-98202-0039 I HAD IN VAIN TRIED EVERYTHING PRODUCIBLE THAT BEGAN WITH A T FROM TAR TO TOAST AND TUB AT LENGTH IT HAD COME INTO MY HEAD THAT THE SIGN LOOKED LIKE A HAMMER AND ON MY LUSTILY CALLING THAT WORD IN MY SISTER'S EAR
7228-98202-0040 AND HAD EXPRESSED A QUALIFIED ASSENT THEREUPON I HAD BROUGHT IN ALL OUR HAMMERS ONE AFTER ANOTHER BUT WITHOUT AVAIL THEN I BETHOUGHT ME OF A CRUTCH THE SHAPE BEING MUCH THE SAME AND I BORROWED ONE IN THE VILLAGE
7228-98202-0041 AND DISPLAYED IT TO MY SISTER WITH CONSIDERABLE CONFIDENCE BUT SHE SHOOK HER HEAD TO THAT EXTENT WHEN SHE WAS SHOWN IT THAT WE WERE TERRIFIED LEST IN HER WEAK AND SHATTERED STATE SHE SHOULD DISLOCATE HER NECK
7228-98202-0042 WHEN MY SISTER FOUND THAT BIDDY WAS VERY QUICK TO UNDERSTAND HER THIS MYSTERIOUS SIGN REAPPEARED ON THE SLATE BIDDY LOOKED THOUGHTFULLY AT IT HEARD MY EXPLANATION LOOKED THOUGHTFULLY AT MY SISTER
7228-98202-0043 LOOKED THOUGHTFULLY AT JOE WHO WAS ALWAYS REPRESENTED ON THE SLATE
7228-98202-0044 AND RAN INTO THE FORGE FOLLOWED BY JOE AND ME WHY OF COURSE CRIED BIDDY WITH AN EXULTANT FACE DON'T YOU SEE IT'S HIM ORLICK WITHOUT A DOUBT SHE HAD LOST HIS NAME AND COULD ONLY SIGNIFY HIM BY HIS HAMMER
7228-98202-0045 WE TOLD HIM WHY WE WANTED HIM TO COME INTO THE KITCHEN AND HE SLOWLY LAID DOWN HIS HAMMER WIPED HIS BROW WITH HIS ARM TOOK ANOTHER WIPE AT IT WITH HIS APRON AND CAME SLOUCHING OUT WITH A CURIOUS LOOSE VAGABOND BEND IN THE KNEES THAT STRONGLY DISTINGUISHED HIM
7228-98202-0046 I CONFESS THAT I EXPECTED TO SEE MY SISTER DENOUNCE HIM AND THAT I WAS DISAPPOINTED BY THE DIFFERENT RESULT SHE MANIFESTED THE GREATEST ANXIETY TO BE ON GOOD TERMS WITH HIM WAS EVIDENTLY MUCH PLEASED BY HIS BEING AT LENGTH PRODUCED
7228-98202-0047 SHE WATCHED HIS COUNTENANCE AS IF SHE WERE PARTICULARLY WISHFUL TO BE ASSURED THAT HE TOOK KINDLY TO HIS RECEPTION SHE SHOWED EVERY POSSIBLE DESIRE TO CONCILIATE HIM AND THERE WAS AN AIR OF HUMBLE PROPITIATION IN ALL SHE DID
