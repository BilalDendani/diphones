6499-87508-0000 THE DIFFICULT ODD AND MOST INCONSTANT HUMOURS OF OTHERS ALTHOUGH THEY MAY FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT AT TIMES TO DO SO NO MATTER HOW REGULAR AND PERFECT WE MAY BE
6499-87508-0001 WE HAVE ALWAYS NEED OF COMPASSION AND INDULGENCE FOR OTHERS TO BE BORNE WITH WE MUST BEAR WITH OTHERS TO BE LOVED WE MUST LOVE TO BE HELPED WE MUST HELP
6499-87508-0002 TO BE JOYFUL OURSELVES WE MUST MAKE OTHERS SO SURROUNDED AS WE ARE BY SO MANY DIFFERENT MINDS CHARACTERS AND INTERESTS HOW CAN WE LIVE IN PEACE FOR A SINGLE DAY
6499-87508-0003 IF WE ARE NOT CONDESCENDING ACCOMMODATING YIELDING SELF DENYING READY TO RENOUNCE EVEN A GOOD PROJECT
6499-87508-0004 AND TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF THOSE FAULTS AND SHORTCOMINGS WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR POWER OR DUTY TO CORRECT CHARITY PATIENTLY LISTENS TO A BORE ANSWERS A USELESS QUESTION
6499-87508-0005 RENDERS SERVICE EVEN WHEN THE NEED IS ONLY IMAGINARY WITHOUT EVER BETRAYING THE LEAST SIGNS OF ANNOYANCE IT NEVER ASKS FOR EXCEPTIONS OR PRIVILEGES FOR FEAR OF EXCITING JEALOUSY
6499-87508-0006 THROUGH A MOTIVE OF BITTER ZEAL IT SEEKS TO FIND IN ONESELF THE FAULTS IT NOTICES IN OTHERS AND PERHAPS GREATER ONES AND TRIES TO CORRECT THEM
6499-87508-0007 WE WOULD HAVE OTHERS STRICTLY CORRECTED BUT ARE NOT FOND OF BEING CORRECTED OURSELVES THE LARGE LIBERTY OF OTHERS DISPLEASES US AND YET WE DO NOT WISH TO BE DENIED ANYTHING WE ASK FOR
6499-87508-0008 WE ARE WILLING THAT OTHERS BE BOUND UP BY LAWS AND WE SUFFER NOT OURSELVES TO BE RESTRAINED BY ANY MEANS THUS IT IS EVIDENT HOW SELDOM WE WEIGH OUR NEIGHBOUR IN THE SAME BALANCE WITH OURSELVES
6499-87508-0009 TO REFUSE NO REASONABLE SERVICE AND TO ACCEPT OR REFUSE IN AN AFFABLE MANNER CHARITY IS GENEROUS IT DOES EVERYTHING IT CAN WHEN EVEN IT CAN DO LITTLE IT WISHES TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE
6499-87508-0010 IT NEVER LETS SLIP AN OPPORTUNITY OF COMFORTING HELPING AND TAKING THE MOST PAINFUL PART AFTER THE EXAMPLE OF ITS DIVINE MODEL WHO CAME TO SERVE NOT TO BE SERVED
6499-87508-0011 ONE RELIGIOUS SEEMINGLY IN PAIN SEEKS COMFORT ANOTHER DESIRES SOME BOOK INSTRUMENT ET CETERA A THIRD BENDS UNDER A BURDEN WHILE A FOURTH IS AFFLICTED IN ALL THESE CASES
6499-87508-0012 CHARITY COMES TO THE AID BY CONSOLING THE ONE PROCURING LITTLE GRATIFICATIONS FOR THE OTHER AND HELPING ANOTHER WITHOUT COMPLAINING OF THE INCREASED LABOUR OR THE CARELESSNESS OF OTHERS
6499-87508-0013 IT FINISHES THE WORK LEFT UNDONE BY THEM TOO HAPPY TO DIMINISH THEIR TROUBLE WHILE AUGMENTING ITS OWN REWARD DOES THE HUNTER SAYS SAINT JOHN CHRYSOSTOM WHO FINDS SPLENDID GAME
6499-87508-0014 BLAME THOSE WHO BEAT THE BRUSHWOOD BEFORE HIM OR DOES THE TRAVELLER WHO FINDS A PURSE OF GOLD ON THE ROAD NEGLECT TO PICK IT UP BECAUSE OTHERS WHO PRECEDED HIM TOOK NO NOTICE OF IT
6499-87508-0015 IT WOULD BE A STRANGE THING TO FIND RELIGIOUS USELESSLY GIVING THEMSELVES TO ARDENT DESIRES OF WORKS OF CHARITY ABROAD SUCH AS NURSING IN A HOSPITAL OR CARRYING THE GOSPEL INTO UNCIVILIZED LANDS
6499-87508-0016 SEVERAL OFFEND IN GIVING BECAUSE THEY DO SO WITH A BAD GRACE OTHERS IN REFUSING DO NOT OFFEND BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW TO TEMPER THEIR REFUSAL BY SWEETNESS OF MANNER
6499-87508-0017 CHARITY POSSESSES THIS ART IN A HIGH DEGREE AND BESIDES RAISES A MERE WORLDLY ART INTO A VIRTUE AND FRUIT OF THE HOLY GHOST
6499-87508-0018 SO CHARITY IN THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY PLACES EVERYTHING IN COMMON CONTENT AFFLICTION MATERIAL GOODS DRIVING OUT OF EXISTENCE THE WORDS MINE AND THINE
6499-87508-0019 IT LAVISHES KIND WORDS AND CONSOLATIONS ON ALL WHO SUFFER IN ANY WAY THROUGH ILL HUMOUR SICKNESS WANT OF SUCCESS ET CETERA IT REJOICES WHEN THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL HONOURED AND TRUSTED
6499-87508-0020 OR ENDOWED WITH GIFTS OF NATURE OR GRACE FELICITATES THEM ON THEIR GOOD FORTUNE AND THANKS GOD FOR THEM IF ON THE ONE HAND COMPASSION SWEETENS PAINS TO THE SUFFERER BY SHARING THEM
6499-87508-0021 WHEN DAVID RETURNED AFTER HE SLEW THE PHILISTINES THE WOMEN CAME OUT OF ALL THE CITIES OF ISRAEL SINGING AND DANCING TO MEET KING SAUL AND THE WOMEN SANG AS THEY PLAYED
6499-87508-0022 SAUL SLEW HIS THOUSANDS AND DAVID HIS TEN THOUSANDS SAUL WAS EXCEEDINGLY ANGRY AND THIS WORD WAS DISPLEASING IN HIS EYES AND HE SAID THEY HAVE GIVEN DAVID TEN THOUSAND
6499-87508-0023 AND TO ME THEY HAVE GIVEN BUT A THOUSAND AND SAUL DID NOT LOOK ON DAVID WITH A GOOD EYE FROM THAT DAY FORWARD AND SAUL HELD A SPEAR IN HIS HAND AND THREW IT THINKING TO NAIL DAVID TO THE WALL
6499-87508-0024 ONE KINGS THUS IT IS THAT THE JEALOUS COMPLAIN OF THEIR BRETHREN WHO ARE MORE SUCCESSFUL LEARNED OR PRAISED THUS IT IS THAT THEY LANCE DARTS OF CALUMNY DENUNCIATION AND REVENGE
6499-87508-0025 NOT TO BE IRRITATED WHEN OTHERS WRONG US WE MUST PARDON AND DO GOOD FOR EVIL AS GOD HAS PARDONED US AND RENDERED GOOD FOR EVIL IN JESUS CHRIST
6499-87508-0026 IT ALWAYS STRIVES TO THROW ITS MANTLE OVER THE EVIL DOINGS OF OTHERS PERSUADING ITSELF THAT THEY WERE THE EFFECTS OF SURPRISE INADVERTENCE OR AT MOST VERY SLIGHT MALICE
6499-87508-0027 IF AN EXPLANATION IS NECESSARY IT IS THE FIRST TO ACCUSE ITSELF NEVER DOES IT PERMIT THE KEEPING OF A PAINFUL THOUGHT AGAINST ANY OF THE BRETHREN AND DOES ALL IN ITS POWER TO HINDER THEM FROM THE SAME
6499-87508-0028 CHARITY GIVES NO OCCASION TO OTHERS TO SUFFER BUT SUFFERS ALL PATIENTLY NOT ONCE BUT ALL THROUGH LIFE EVERY DAY AND ALMOST EVERY HOUR
6499-87508-0029 EIGHTH CHARACTERISTIC TO PRACTISE MODERATION AND CONSIDERATION TELL TALES NASTY NAMES COLD ANSWERS LIES MOCKERY HARSH WORDS ET CETERA
6499-87508-0030 ARE ALL CONTRARY TO CHARITY SAINT JOHN CHRYSOSTOM SAYS WHEN ANYONE LOADS YOU WITH INJURIES CLOSE YOUR MOUTH BECAUSE IF YOU OPEN IT YOU WILL ONLY CAUSE A TEMPEST
6499-87508-0031 WHEN IN A ROOM BETWEEN TWO OPEN DOORS THROUGH WHICH A VIOLENT WIND RUSHES AND THROWS THINGS IN DISORDER IF YOU CLOSE ONE DOOR THE VIOLENCE OF THE WIND IS CHECKED AND ORDER IS RESTORED
6499-87508-0032 THOSE THEN WHO RECEIVE THE HOLY OF HOLIES WITHOUT DOING PENANCE FOR THE SINS OF THE TONGUE ARE LIKE THOSE WHO WOULD KEEP A HEAP OF STONES AT THEIR DOORS TO STONE A FRIEND ON ARRIVAL
6499-87508-0033 IF WE TOUCH THEM ON THESE POINTS IT WILL BE LIKE PLAYING AN ACCOMPANIMENT TO AN INSTRUMENT WITH ONE STRING OUT OF TUNE
6499-87508-0034 CARE OF THE SICK AND INFIRM CHARITY LAVISHES CARE ON THE SICK AND INFIRM ON THE OLD ON GUESTS AND NEW COMERS IT REQUIRES THAT WE VISIT THOSE WHO ARE ILL
6499-87508-0035 TO CHEER AND CONSOLE THEM TO FORESEE THEIR WANTS AND THEREBY TO SPARE THEM THE PAIN OR HUMILIATION OF ASKING FOR ANYTHING
6499-87508-0036 ESTEEM THE SICK LOVE THEM RESPECT AND HONOUR THEM AS BEING CONSECRATED BY THE UNCTION OF THE CROSS AND MARKED WITH THE CHARACTER OF A SUFFERING JESUS CHARITY PAYS HONOUR TO THE AGED IN EVERY RESPECT
6499-87508-0037 COINCIDES WITH THEIR SENTIMENTS CONSULTS THEM FORESTALLS THEIR DESIRES AND ATTEMPTS NOT TO REFORM IN THEM WHAT CANNOT BE REFORMED CHARITY RECEIVES FRATERNALLY ALL GUESTS AND NEW COMERS
6499-87508-0038 IT ALSO CAUSES US TO LAVISH TESTIMONIES OF AFFECTION ON THOSE WHO ARE SETTING OUT AND WARNS US TO BE VERY CAREFUL OF SAYING OR DOING ANYTHING THAT MAY IN THE LEAST DEGREE OFFEND EVEN THE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE
6499-87508-0039 OR LIKE A USELESS PIECE OF FURNITURE IN REALITY WHAT ARE THEY DOING THEY PRAY AND DO PENANCE FOR THE COMMUNITY TURN AWAY THE SCOURGE OF GOD
6499-87508-0040 DRAW DOWN HIS GRACES AND BLESSINGS MERIT PERHAPS THE GRACE OF PERSEVERANCE FOR SEVERAL WHOSE VOCATION IS SHAKING HAND DOWN TO THE YOUNGER MEMBERS THE TRADITIONS AND SPIRIT OF THE INSTITUTE
6499-87508-0041 AND FINALLY PRACTISE AND CAUSE TO BE PRACTISED A THOUSAND ACTS OF VIRTUE DID OUR DIVINE LORD WORK LESS EFFICACIOUSLY FOR THE CHURCH WHEN HE HUNG ON THE CROSS
6499-87508-0042 IS THAT WE SPEAK SO LITTLE OF THEM WE TRY TO CHANGE THE DISCOURSE AS IF IT WERE HURTFUL WE LET THE DEAD BURY THEIR DEAD THEIR MEMORY PERISHES WITH US LIKE THE SOUND OF THE FUNERAL KNELL
6499-87508-0043 WITHOUT THINKING THAT A FRIENDSHIP WHICH PERISHES WITH DEATH IS NOT TRUE IT IS A SIGN OF PIETY TO SPEAK OF THEIR VIRTUES AS IT URGES US TO IMITATE THEM
6499-87508-0044 A THIRD QUOTES SOME OF THEIR SAYINGS WHILE A FOURTH ADDS SOME OTHER EDIFYING FACT AND WHO IS THE RELIGIOUS THAT WILL NOT ON SUCH OCCASIONS BREATHE A SILENT PRAYER TO GOD
6499-87508-0045 AND APPLY SOME INDULGENCE OR OTHER SATISFACTORY WORK FOR THE HAPPY REPOSE OF THEIR SOULS CHARITY ALSO PRAYS FOR THOSE WHO WANT HELP MOST AND WHO ARE OFTEN KNOWN TO GOD ALONE
6499-87508-0046 THOSE WHOSE CONSTANCY IS WAVERING THOSE WHO ARE LED BY VIOLENT TEMPTATIONS TO THE EDGE OF THE PRECIPICE IT EXPANDS PENT UP SOULS BY CONSOLATIONS OR ADVICE
6499-87508-0047 CAN THERE BE ANYTHING MORE AGREEABLE TO GOD MORE USEFUL TO THE CHURCH OR MORE MERITORIOUS THAN TO FOSTER THUS AMONGST THE WELL BELOVED CHILDREN OF GOD PEACE JOY
6499-87508-0048 TO HAVE A LIVELY INTEREST IN THE WHOLE ORDER IN ITS WORKS ITS SUCCESS AND ITS FAILURES
6499-87508-0049 RELIGIOUS WHO HAVE THE FAMILY SPIRIT WISH TO KNOW EVERYTHING WHICH CONCERNS THE WELL BEING OF THE DIFFERENT HOUSES THEY WILLINGLY TAKE THEIR PENS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE EDIFICATION
6499-87508-0050 AND SATISFY THE LAWFUL CURIOSITY OF THEIR BRETHREN THEY BLESS GOD WHEN THEY HEAR GOOD NEWS AND GRIEVE AT BAD NEWS LOSSES BY DEATH AND ABOVE ALL SCANDALOUS LOSSES OF VOCATION
6499-87508-0051 BECOMES ASSOCIATED AT THE SAME TIME IN THE MERIT IT SHARES IN A CERTAIN MANNER IN THE GIFTS AND LABOURS OF OTHERS IT IS AT THE SAME TIME THE EYE THE HAND THE TONGUE AND THE FOOT
6499-87508-0052 SINCE IT REJOICES AT WHAT IS DONE BY THE EYE THE HAND THE TONGUE ET CETERA OR RATHER IT IS AS THE SOUL WHICH PRESIDES OVER ALL AND TO WHOM NOTHING IS A STRANGER IN THE BODY OVER WHICH IT PRESIDES
6499-87508-0053 MUTUAL EDIFICATION BE EDIFIED AT THE SIGHT OF YOUR BRETHREN'S VIRTUES AND EDIFY THEM BY YOUR OWN IN OTHER WORDS BE ALTERNATELY DISCIPLE AND MASTER
6499-87508-0054 PROFIT BY THE LABOURS OF OTHERS AND MAKE THEM PROFIT BY YOUR OWN RECEIVE FROM ALL IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GIVE TO ALL BORROW HUMILITY FROM ONE OBEDIENCE FROM ANOTHER
6499-87508-0055 UNION WITH GOD AND THE PRACTICE OF MORTIFICATION FROM OTHERS BY CHARITY WE STORE UP IN OURSELVES THE GIFTS OF GRACE ENJOYED BY EVERY MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY
6499-87508-0056 IN ORDER TO DISPENSE THEM TO ALL BY A HAPPY COMMERCE AND ADMIRABLE EXCHANGE AS THE BEE DRAWS HONEY FROM THE SWEETEST JUICES CONTAINED IN EACH FLOWER
6499-87508-0057 AS THE ARTIST STUDIES THE MASTERPIECES TO REPRODUCE THEIR MARVELLOUS TINTS IN PICTURES WHICH IN THEIR TURN BECOME MODELS
6499-87508-0058 AS A MIRROR PLACED IN A FOCUS RECEIVES THE RAYS OF BRILLIANCY FROM A THOUSAND OTHERS PLACED AROUND IT TO RE INVEST THEM WITH A DAZZLING BRILLIANCY
