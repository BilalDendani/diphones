2062-109873-0000 THE JAR OF ROSEMARY THERE WAS ONCE A LITTLE PRINCE WHOSE MOTHER THE QUEEN WAS SICK ALL SUMMER SHE LAY IN BED AND EVERYTHING WAS KEPT QUIET IN THE PALACE BUT
2062-109873-0001 WHEN THE AUTUMN CAME SHE GREW BETTER EVERY DAY BROUGHT COLOR TO HER CHEEKS AND STRENGTH TO HER LIMBS AND BY AND BY THE LITTLE PRINCE WAS ALLOWED TO GO INTO HER ROOM AND STAND BESIDE HER BED TO TALK TO HER
2062-109873-0002 HE WAS VERY GLAD OF THIS FOR HE WANTED TO ASK HER WHAT SHE WOULD LIKE FOR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT AND AS SOON AS HE HAD KISSED HER AND LAID HIS CHEEK AGAINST HERS HE WHISPERED HIS QUESTION IN HER EAR
2062-109873-0003 SAID THE QUEEN A SMILE AND A KISS AND A HUG AROUND THE NECK THESE ARE THE DEAREST GIFTS I KNOW BUT THE PRINCE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS ANSWER
2062-109873-0004 I BELIEVE A LITTLE JAR OF ROSEMARY LIKE THAT WHICH BLOOMED IN MY MOTHER'S WINDOW WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WOULD PLEASE ME BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE THE LITTLE PRINCE WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR THIS
2062-109873-0005 AND AS SOON AS HE HAD GONE OUT OF THE QUEEN'S ROOM HE SENT A SERVANT TO HIS FATHER'S GREENHOUSES TO INQUIRE FOR A ROSEMARY PLANT BUT THE SERVANT CAME BACK WITH DISAPPOINTING NEWS
2062-109873-0006 THERE WERE CARNATION PINKS IN THE KING'S GREENHOUSES AND ROSES WITH GOLDEN HEARTS AND LOVELY LILIES BUT THERE WAS NO ROSEMARY ROSEMARY WAS A COMMON HERB AND GREW MOSTLY IN COUNTRY GARDENS
2062-109873-0007 BUT EACH ONE CAME BACK WITH THE SAME STORY TO TELL THERE WAS ROSEMARY ENOUGH AND TO SPARE IN THE SPRING BUT THE FROST HAD BEEN IN THE COUNTRY
2062-109873-0008 AND THERE WAS NOT A GREEN SPRIG LEFT TO BRING TO THE LITTLE PRINCE FOR HIS MOTHER'S CHRISTMAS PRESENT TWO DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS HOWEVER NEWS WAS BROUGHT THAT ROSEMARY HAD BEEN FOUND
2062-109873-0009 A LOVELY GREEN PLANT GROWING IN A JAR RIGHT IN THE VERY CITY WHERE THE PRINCE HIMSELF LIVED
2062-109873-0010 WHY HAVE YOU NOT BROUGHT IT WITH YOU GO AND GET IT AT ONCE WELL AS FOR THAT
2062-109873-0011 THERE IS A LITTLE DIFFICULTY THE OLD WOMAN TO WHOM THE ROSEMARY BELONGS DID NOT WANT TO SELL IT EVEN THOUGH I OFFERED HER A HANDFUL OF SILVER FOR IT THEN GIVE HER A PURSE OF GOLD SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
2062-109873-0012 SO A PURSE FILLED SO FULL OF GOLD THAT IT COULD NOT HOLD ANOTHER PIECE WAS TAKEN TO THE OLD WOMAN BUT PRESENTLY IT WAS BROUGHT BACK SHE WOULD NOT SELL HER ROSEMARY NO NOT EVEN FOR A PURSE OF GOLD
2062-109873-0013 SAID THE PRINCE'S NURSE SO THE ROYAL CARRIAGE DRAWN BY SIX WHITE HORSES WAS BROUGHT AND THE LITTLE PRINCE AND HIS SERVANTS RODE AWAY TO THE OLD WOMAN'S HOUSE AND WHEN THEY GOT THERE THE FIRST THING THEY SPIED
2062-109873-0014 WAS THE LITTLE GREEN PLANT IN A JAR STANDING IN THE OLD WOMAN'S WINDOW THE OLD WOMAN HERSELF CAME TO THE DOOR AND SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE THE LITTLE PRINCE SHE INVITED HIM IN AND BADE HIM WARM HIS HANDS BY THE FIRE
2062-109873-0015 AND GAVE HIM A COOKY FROM HER CUPBOARD TO EAT SHE HAD A LITTLE GRANDSON NO OLDER THAN THE PRINCE BUT HE WAS SICK AND COULD NOT RUN ABOUT AND PLAY LIKE OTHER CHILDREN HE LAY IN A LITTLE WHITE BED IN THE OLD WOMAN'S ROOM
2062-109873-0016 AND TOOK OUT HIS FAVORITE PLAYTHING WHICH HE ALWAYS CARRIED IN HIS POCKET AND SHOWED IT TO HIM THE PRINCE'S FAVORITE PLAYTHING WAS A BALL WHICH WAS LIKE NO OTHER BALL THAT HAD EVER BEEN MADE
2062-109873-0017 IT WAS WOVEN OF MAGIC STUFF AS BRIGHT AS THE SUNLIGHT AS SPARKLING AS THE STARLIGHT AND AS GOLDEN AS THE MOON AT HARVEST TIME AND WHEN THE LITTLE PRINCE THREW IT INTO THE AIR OR BOUNCED IT ON THE FLOOR
2062-109873-0018 OR TURNED IT IN HIS HANDS IT RANG LIKE A CHIME OF SILVER BELLS THE SICK CHILD LAUGHED TO HEAR IT AND HELD OUT HIS HANDS FOR IT AND THE PRINCE LET HIM HOLD IT
2062-109873-0019 BUT SHE WOULD ANSWER NOTHING TILL THEY HAD TAKEN HER TO THE LITTLE PRINCE SILVER AND GOLD WOULD NOT BUY THE ROSEMARY SHE SAID WHEN SHE SAW HIM
2062-109873-0020 BUT MY BALL IS THE MOST WONDERFUL BALL THAT WAS EVER MADE CRIED THE LITTLE PRINCE AND IT IS MY FAVORITE PLAYTHING I WOULD NOT GIVE IT AWAY FOR ANYTHING
2062-109873-0021 AND SO THE OLD WOMAN HAD TO GO HOME WITH HER JAR OF ROSEMARY UNDER HER SHAWL THE NEXT DAY WAS THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND THERE WAS A GREAT STIR AND BUSTLE IN THE PALACE
2062-109873-0022 THE QUEEN'S PHYSICIAN HAD SAID THAT SHE MIGHT SIT UP TO SEE THE CHRISTMAS TREE THAT NIGHT AND HAVE HER PRESENTS WITH THE REST OF THE FAMILY AND EVERY ONE WAS RUNNING TO AND FRO TO GET THINGS IN READINESS FOR HER
2062-109873-0023 THE QUEEN HAD SO MANY PRESENTS AND VERY FINE THEY WERE TOO THAT THE CHRISTMAS TREE COULD NOT HOLD THEM ALL SO THEY WERE PUT ON A TABLE BEFORE THE THRONE AND WREATHED AROUND WITH HOLLY AND WITH PINE
2062-109873-0024 THE LITTLE PRINCE WENT IN WITH HIS NURSE TO SEE THEM AND TO PUT HIS GIFT WHICH WAS A JEWEL AMONG THEM SHE WANTED A JAR OF ROSEMARY HE SAID AS HE LOOKED AT THE GLITTERING HEAP
2062-109873-0025 SHE WILL NEVER THINK OF IT AGAIN WHEN SHE SEES THESE THINGS YOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT SAID THE NURSE BUT THE LITTLE PRINCE WAS NOT SURE HE THOUGHT OF IT HIMSELF MANY TIMES THAT DAY AND ONCE WHEN HE WAS PLAYING WITH HIS BALL
2062-109873-0026 HE SAID TO THE NURSE IF I HAD A ROSEMARY PLANT I'D BE WILLING TO SELL IT FOR A PURSE FULL OF GOLD WOULDN'T YOU INDEED YES SAID THE NURSE AND SO WOULD ANY ONE ELSE IN HIS RIGHT SENSES YOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT
2062-109873-0027 THE LITTLE BOY WAS NOT SATISFIED THOUGH
2062-109873-0028 HE SAID TO THE NURSE I WISH IT WERE SPRING IT IS EASY TO GET ROSEMARY THEN IS IT NOT
2062-109873-0029 WITH YOUR ROSEMARY ROSEMARY ROSEMARY
2062-109873-0030 YOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT BUT THE LITTLE PRINCE WAS NOT SURE AND WHEN THE NURSE HAD GONE TO HER SUPPER AND HE WAS LEFT BY CHANCE FOR A MOMENT ALONE HE PUT ON HIS COAT OF FUR AND TAKING THE BALL WITH HIM
2062-109873-0031 HE SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE PALACE AND HASTENED TOWARD THE OLD WOMAN'S HOUSE HE HAD NEVER BEEN OUT AT NIGHT BY HIMSELF BEFORE AND HE MIGHT HAVE FELT A LITTLE AFRAID
2062-109873-0032 HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE FRIENDLY STARS THAT TWINKLED IN THE SKY ABOVE HIM WE WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY THEY SEEMED TO SAY AND HE TRUDGED ON BRAVELY IN THEIR LIGHT
2062-109873-0033 THE OLD WOMAN MADE HASTE TO ANSWER THE KNOCK AND WHEN SHE SAW THE PRINCE SHE WAS TOO ASTONISHED TO SPEAK HERE IS THE BALL HE CRIED PUTTING IT INTO HER HANDS PLEASE GIVE ME THE ROSEMARY FOR MY MOTHER
2062-109873-0034 AND SO IT HAPPENED THAT WHEN THE QUEEN SAT DOWN BEFORE HER GREAT TABLE OF GIFTS THE FIRST THING SHE SPIED WAS A JAR OF SWEET ROSEMARY LIKE THAT WHICH HAD BLOOMED IN HER MOTHER'S WINDOW WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL
2062-109873-0035 SHE SAID AND SHE TOOK THE LITTLE PRINCE IN HER ARMS
