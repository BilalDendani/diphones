594-127732-0000 WHEN THE WORLDS AND ALL BEGAN THE GODS WERE STERN AND OLD AND THEY SAW THE BEGINNING FROM UNDER EYEBROWS HOAR WITH YEARS ALL BUT INZANA THEIR CHILD WHO PLAYED WITH THE GOLDEN BALL INZANA WAS THE CHILD OF ALL THE GODS
594-127732-0001 AND THE LAW BEFORE THE BEGINNING AND THEREAFTER WAS THAT ALL SHOULD OBEY THE GODS YET HITHER AND THITHER WENT ALL PEGANA'S GODS TO OBEY THE DAWNCHILD BECAUSE SHE LOVED TO BE OBEYED IT WAS DARK ALL OVER THE WORLD AND EVEN IN PEGANA WHERE DWELL THE GODS
594-127732-0002 IT WAS DARK WHEN THE CHILD INZANA THE DAWN FIRST FOUND HER GOLDEN BALL THEN RUNNING DOWN THE STAIRWAY OF THE GODS WITH TRIPPING FEET CHALCEDONY ONYX CHALCEDONY ONYX STEP BY STEP SHE CAST HER GOLDEN BALL ACROSS THE SKY
594-127732-0003 THE GOLDEN BALL WENT BOUNDING UP THE SKY AND THE DAWNCHILD WITH HER FLARING HAIR STOOD LAUGHING UPON THE STAIRWAY OF THE GODS AND IT WAS DAY SO GLEAMING FIELDS BELOW SAW THE FIRST OF ALL THE DAYS THAT THE GODS HAVE DESTINED
594-127732-0004 BUT TOWARDS EVENING CERTAIN MOUNTAINS AFAR AND ALOOF CONSPIRED TOGETHER TO STAND BETWEEN THE WORLD AND THE GOLDEN BALL AND TO WRAP THEIR CRAGS ABOUT IT AND TO SHUT IT FROM THE WORLD AND ALL THE WORLD WAS DARKENED WITH THEIR PLOT AND THE DAWNCHILD UP IN PEGANA CRIED FOR HER GOLDEN BALL
594-127732-0005 ALL IN A WORLD OF ROCKS UNDER THE RIM OF THE SKY AND SHE WANTED HER GOLDEN BALL AND COULD NOT LOVE THE DARK THEREAT UMBORODOM WHOSE HOUND WAS THE THUNDER TOOK HIS HOUND IN LEASH AND STRODE AWAY ACROSS THE SKY AFTER THE GOLDEN BALL
594-127732-0006 UNTIL HE CAME TO THE MOUNTAINS AFAR AND ALOOF THERE DID THE THUNDER PUT HIS NOSE TO THE ROCKS AND BAY ALONG THE VALLEYS AND FAST AT HIS HEELS FOLLOWED UMBORODOM AND THE NEARER THE HOUND THE THUNDER CAME TO THE GOLDEN BALL THE LOUDER DID HE BAY
594-127732-0007 BUT HAUGHTY AND SILENT STOOD THE MOUNTAINS WHOSE PLOT HAD DARKENED THE WORLD ALL IN THE DARK AMONG THE CRAGS IN A MIGHTY CAVERN GUARDED BY TWO TWIN PEAKS AT LAST THEY FOUND THE GOLDEN BALL FOR WHICH THE DAWNCHILD WEPT
594-127732-0008 THEN UNDER THE WORLD WENT UMBORODOM WITH HIS THUNDER PANTING BEHIND HIM AND CAME IN THE DARK BEFORE THE MORNING FROM UNDERNEATH THE WORLD AND GAVE THE DAWNCHILD BACK HER GOLDEN BALL
594-127732-0009 AND UMBORODOM WENT BACK INTO PEGANA AND AT ITS THRESHOLD THE THUNDER WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN THE DAWNCHILD TOSSED THE GOLDEN BALL FAR UP INTO THE BLUE ACROSS THE SKY AND THE SECOND MORNING SHONE UPON THE WORLD
594-127732-0010 THEN ON AN ONYX STEP INZANA SAT DOWN AND WEPT WHO COULD NO MORE BE HAPPY WITHOUT HER GOLDEN BALL AND AGAIN THE GODS WERE SORRY AND THE SOUTH WIND CAME TO TELL HER TALES OF MOST ENCHANTED ISLANDS TO WHOM SHE LISTENED NOT
594-127732-0011 NOR YET TO THE TALES OF TEMPLES IN LONE LANDS THAT THE EAST WIND TOLD HER WHO HAD STOOD BESIDE HER WHEN SHE FLUNG HER GOLDEN BALL BUT FROM FAR AWAY THE WEST WIND CAME WITH NEWS OF THREE GREY TRAVELLERS WRAPT ROUND WITH BATTERED CLOAKS
594-127732-0012 THAT CARRIED AWAY BETWEEN THEM A GOLDEN BALL THEN UP LEAPT THE NORTH WIND HE WHO GUARDS THE POLE AND DREW HIS SWORD OF ICE OUT OF HIS SCABBARD OF SNOW AND SPED AWAY ALONG THE ROAD THAT LEADS ACROSS THE BLUE
594-127732-0013 AND IN THE DARKNESS UNDERNEATH THE WORLD HE MET THE THREE GREY TRAVELLERS AND RUSHED UPON THEM AND DROVE THEM FAR BEFORE HIM SMITING THEM WITH HIS SWORD TILL THEIR GREY CLOAKS STREAMED WITH BLOOD AND OUT OF THE MIDST OF THEM
594-127732-0014 AS THEY FLED WITH FLAPPING CLOAKS ALL RED AND GREY AND TATTERED HE LEAPT UP WITH THE GOLDEN BALL AND GAVE IT TO THE DAWNCHILD AGAIN INZANA TOSSED THE BALL INTO THE SKY MAKING THE THIRD DAY AND UP AND UP IT WENT
594-127732-0015 AND FELL TOWARDS THE FIELDS AND AS INZANA STOOPED TO PICK IT UP SHE SUDDENLY HEARD THE SINGING OF ALL THE BIRDS THAT WERE
594-127732-0016 AND INZANA SAT AND LISTENED AND THOUGHT OF NO GOLDEN BALL NOR EVER OF CHALCEDONY AND ONYX NOR OF ALL HER FATHERS THE GODS BUT ONLY OF ALL THE BIRDS THEN IN THE WOODS AND MEADOWS WHERE THEY HAD ALL SUDDENLY SUNG THEY SUDDENLY CEASED
594-127732-0017 AND INZANA LOOKING UP FOUND THAT HER BALL WAS LOST AND ALL ALONE IN THE STILLNESS ONE OWL LAUGHED WHEN THE GODS HEARD INZANA CRYING FOR HER BALL THEY CLUSTERED TOGETHER ON THE THRESHOLD AND PEERED INTO THE DARK BUT SAW NO GOLDEN BALL
594-127732-0018 AND LEANING FORWARD THEY CRIED OUT TO THE BAT AS HE PASSED UP AND DOWN BAT THAT SEEST ALL THINGS WHERE IS THE GOLDEN BALL AND THOUGH THE BAT ANSWERED NONE HEARD AND NONE OF THE WINDS HAD SEEN IT NOR ANY OF THE BIRDS
594-127732-0019 AND THERE WERE ONLY THE EYES OF THE GODS IN THE DARKNESS PEERING FOR THE GOLDEN BALL THEN SAID THE GODS THOU HAST LOST THY GOLDEN BALL AND THEY MADE HER A MOON OF SILVER TO ROLL ABOUT THE SKY
594-127732-0020 AND THE CHILD CRIED AND THREW IT UPON THE STAIRWAY AND CHIPPED AND BROKE ITS EDGES AND ASKED FOR THE GOLDEN BALL AND LIMPANG TUNG
594-127732-0021 STOLE OUT OF PEGANA AND CREPT ACROSS THE SKY AND FOUND THE BIRDS OF ALL THE WORLD SITTING IN TREES AND IVY AND WHISPERING IN THE DARK HE ASKED THEM ONE BY ONE FOR NEWS OF THE GOLDEN BALL
594-127732-0022 A HERON HAD SEEN IT LYING IN A POND BUT A WILD DUCK IN SOME REEDS HAD SEEN IT LAST AS SHE CAME HOME ACROSS THE HILLS AND THEN IT WAS ROLLING VERY FAR AWAY AT LAST THE COCK CRIED OUT THAT HE HAD SEEN IT LYING BENEATH THE WORLD
594-127732-0023 AND THE COCK AND ALL HIS TRIBE CRIED OUT WE FOUND IT WE FOUND THE GOLDEN BALL AGAIN INZANA TOSSED THE BALL AFAR LAUGHING WITH JOY TO SEE IT HER HANDS STRETCHED UPWARDS HER GOLDEN HAIR AFLOAT
594-127732-0024 AND CAREFULLY SHE WATCHED IT AS IT FELL BUT ALAS IT FELL WITH A SPLASH INTO THE GREAT SEA AND GLEAMED AND SHIMMERED AS IT FELL TILL THE WATERS BECAME DARK ABOVE IT AND COULD BE SEEN NO MORE AND MEN ON THE WORLD SAID
594-127732-0025 HOW THE DEW HAS FALLEN AND HOW THE MISTS SET IN WITH BREEZES FROM THE STREAMS BUT THE DEW WAS THE TEARS OF THE DAWNCHILD AND THE MISTS WERE HER SIGHS
594-127732-0026 THERE WILL NO MORE COME A TIME WHEN I PLAY WITH MY BALL AGAIN FOR NOW IT IS LOST FOR EVER AND THE GODS TRIED TO COMFORT INZANA AS SHE PLAYED WITH HER SILVER MOON BUT SHE WOULD NOT HEAR THEM AND WENT IN TEARS TO SLID WHERE HE PLAYED WITH GLEAMING SAILS
594-127732-0027 AND IN HIS MIGHTY TREASURY TURNED OVER GEMS AND PEARLS AND LORDED IT OVER THE SEA AND SHE SAID O SLID WHOSE SOUL IS IN THE SEA BRING BACK MY GOLDEN BALL AND SLID STOOD UP SWARTHY AND CLAD IN SEAWEED
594-127732-0028 AND MIGHTILY DIVED FROM THE LAST CHALCEDONY STEP
594-127732-0029 THERE ON THE SAND AMONG THE BATTERED NAVIES OF THE NAUTILUS AND BROKEN WEAPONS OF THE SWORDFISH HIDDEN BY DARK WATER HE FOUND THE GOLDEN BALL AND COMING UP IN THE NIGHT ALL GREEN AND DRIPPING
594-127732-0030 TILL IT CAME TO ITS ZENITH AND DROPPED TOWARDS THE WORLD
594-127732-0031 AND SEIZED IT IN HIS JAWS WHEN INZANA SAW THE ECLIPSE BEARING HER PLAYTHING AWAY SHE CRIED ALOUD TO THE THUNDER WHO BURST FROM PEGANA AND FELL HOWLING UPON THE THROAT OF THE ECLIPSE WHO DROPPED THE GOLDEN BALL AND LET IT FALL TOWARDS EARTH
594-127732-0032 BUT THE BLACK MOUNTAINS DISGUISED THEMSELVES WITH SNOW AND AS THE GOLDEN BALL FELL DOWN TOWARDS THEM THEY TURNED THEIR PEAKS TO RUBY CRIMSON AND THEIR LAKES TO SAPPHIRES GLEAMING AMONGST SILVER
594-127732-0033 AND INZANA SAW A JEWELLED CASKET INTO WHICH HER PLAYTHING FELL BUT WHEN SHE STOOPED TO PICK IT UP AGAIN SHE FOUND NO JEWELLED CASKET WITH RUBIES SILVER OR SAPPHIRES BUT ONLY WICKED MOUNTAINS DISGUISED IN SNOW THAT HAD TRAPPED HER GOLDEN BALL
594-127732-0034 AND THEN SHE CRIED BECAUSE THERE WAS NONE TO FIND IT FOR THE THUNDER WAS FAR AWAY CHASING THE ECLIPSE AND ALL THE GODS LAMENTED WHEN THEY SAW HER SORROW
594-127732-0035 WAS YET THE SADDEST AT THE DAWNCHILD'S GRIEF AND WHEN THE GODS SAID PLAY WITH YOUR SILVER MOON
594-127732-0036 WENT OUT TOWARDS THE WORLD TO FIND THE GOLDEN BALL BECAUSE INZANA WEPT AND INTO THE WORLD HE WENT TILL HE CAME TO THE NETHER CLIFFS THAT STAND BY THE INNER MOUNTAINS IN THE SOUL AND HEART OF THE EARTH WHERE THE EARTHQUAKE DWELLETH ALONE
594-127732-0037 AND THE EARTHQUAKE STARTED TO HIS FEET AND FLUNG THE CAVE AWAY THE CAVE WHEREIN HE SLEPT BETWEEN THE CLIFFS AND SHOOK HIMSELF AND WENT GALLOPING ABROAD AND OVERTURNED THE MOUNTAINS THAT HID THE GOLDEN BALL
594-127732-0038 AND BIT THE EARTH BENEATH THEM AND HURLED THEIR CRAGS ABOUT AND COVERED HIMSELF WITH ROCKS AND FALLEN HILLS AND WENT BACK RAVENING AND GROWLING INTO THE SOUL OF THE EARTH AND THERE LAY DOWN AND SLEPT AGAIN FOR A HUNDRED YEARS
594-127732-0039 AND THE GOLDEN BALL ROLLED FREE PASSING UNDER THE SHATTERED EARTH AND SO ROLLED BACK TO PEGANA AND LIMPANG TUNG CAME HOME TO THE ONYX STEP AND TOOK THE DAWNCHILD BY THE HAND AND TOLD NOT WHAT HE HAD DONE BUT SAID IT WAS THE EARTHQUAKE
594-127732-0040 AND WENT AWAY TO SIT AT THE FEET OF THE GODS BUT INZANA WENT AND PATTED THE EARTHQUAKE ON THE HEAD FOR SHE SAID IT WAS DARK AND LONELY IN THE SOUL OF THE EARTH THEREAFTER RETURNING STEP BY STEP CHALCEDONY ONYX CHALCEDONY ONYX
594-127732-0041 UP THE STAIRWAY OF THE GODS SHE CAST AGAIN HER GOLDEN BALL FROM THE THRESHOLD AFAR INTO THE BLUE TO GLADDEN THE WORLD AND THE SKY AND LAUGHED TO SEE IT GO
594-127732-0042 AND FAR AWAY TROGOOL UPON THE UTTER RIM TURNED A PAGE THAT WAS NUMBERED SIX IN A CIPHER THAT NONE MIGHT READ AND AS THE GOLDEN BALL WENT THROUGH THE SKY TO GLEAM ON LANDS AND CITIES THERE CAME THE FOG TOWARDS IT
594-127732-0043 STOOPING AS HE WALKED WITH HIS DARK BROWN CLOAK ABOUT HIM AND BEHIND HIM SLUNK THE NIGHT AND AS THE GOLDEN BALL ROLLED PAST THE FOG SUDDENLY NIGHT SNARLED AND SPRANG UPON IT AND CARRIED IT AWAY HASTILY INZANA GATHERED THE GODS AND SAID
594-127732-0044 THE NIGHT HATH SEIZED MY GOLDEN BALL AND NO GOD ALONE CAN FIND IT NOW FOR NONE CAN SAY HOW FAR THE NIGHT MAY ROAM WHO PROWLS ALL ROUND US AND OUT BEYOND THE WORLDS AT THE ENTREATY OF THEIR DAWNCHILD
594-127732-0045 ALL THE GODS MADE THEMSELVES STARS FOR TORCHES AND FAR AWAY THROUGH ALL THE SKY FOLLOWED THE TRACKS OF NIGHT AS FAR AS HE PROWLED ABROAD AND AT ONE TIME SLID WITH THE PLEIADES IN HIS HAND CAME NIGH TO THE GOLDEN BALL
594-127732-0046 AND ALL THE GODS TOGETHER SEIZED THE BALL AND NIGHT TURNING SMOTE OUT THE TORCHES OF THE GODS AND THEREAFTER SLUNK AWAY AND ALL THE GODS IN TRIUMPH MARCHED UP THE GLEAMING STAIRWAY OF THE GODS
594-127732-0047 THEN FAR BELOW ON THE WORLD A HUMAN CHILD CRIED OUT TO THE DAWNCHILD FOR THE GOLDEN BALL
594-127732-0048 AND CAST THE BALL FROM THE THRESHOLD OF THE GODS TO THE LITTLE HUMAN CHILD THAT PLAYED IN THE FIELDS BELOW AND WOULD ONE DAY DIE AND THE CHILD PLAYED ALL DAY LONG WITH THE GOLDEN BALL DOWN IN THE LITTLE FIELDS WHERE THE HUMANS LIVED
594-127732-0049 AND WENT TO BED AT EVENING AND PUT IT BENEATH HIS PILLOW AND WENT TO SLEEP AND NO ONE WORKED IN ALL THE WORLD BECAUSE THE CHILD WAS PLAYING AND THE LIGHT OF THE GOLDEN BALL STREAMED UP FROM UNDER THE PILLOW AND OUT THROUGH THE HALF SHUT DOOR AND SHONE IN THE WESTERN SKY
594-127732-0050 IN THE NIGHT TIME TIP TOED INTO THE ROOM AND TOOK THE BALL GENTLY FOR HE WAS A GOD AWAY FROM UNDER THE PILLOW AND BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DAWNCHILD TO GLEAM ON AN ONYX STEP
594-127732-0051 AND SLID SHALL DIVE FROM THE THRESHOLD INTO THE SEA
594-127732-0052 AND UP THE VALLEYS SHALL GO UMBORODOM
594-127732-0053 BUT NEVER FIND THE BALL AND MEN NO LONGER HAVING LIGHT OF THE GOLDEN BALL SHALL PRAY TO THE GODS NO MORE WHO HAVING NO WORSHIP SHALL BE NO MORE THE GODS
