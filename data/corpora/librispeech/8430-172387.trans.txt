8430-172387-0017 COME FROM TORREON THEY GOING TO SALT LAKE FOR SOME JOB A AND STAY OFF WITH HIM TWO THREE DAYS AND HE MUS HAVE A PARTY YOU LIKE TO COME THAT WAS HOW THEA CAME TO GO TO THE MEXICAN BALL
8430-172387-0018 MEXICAN TOWN HAD BEEN INCREASED BY HALF A DOZEN NEW FAMILIES DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS AND THE MEXICANS HAD PUT UP AN ADOBE DANCE HALL THAT LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE ONE OF THEIR OWN DWELLINGS
8430-172387-0019 EXCEPT THAT IT WAS A LITTLE LONGER AND WAS SO UNPRETENTIOUS THAT NOBODY IN MOONSTONE KNEW OF ITS EXISTENCE THE SPANISH BOYS ARE RETICENT ABOUT THEIR OWN AFFAIRS
8430-172387-0020 RAY KENNEDY USED TO KNOW ABOUT ALL THEIR LITTLE DOINGS BUT SINCE HIS DEATH THERE WAS NO ONE WHOM THE MEXICANS CONSIDERED SIMPATICO
8430-172387-0021 MISSUS KRONBORG SMILED SHE NOTICED THAT THEA HAD PUT ON A WHITE DRESS AND HAD DONE HER HAIR UP WITH UNUSUAL CARE AND THAT SHE CARRIED HER BEST BLUE SCARF
8430-172387-0022 THEA MADE A FEEBLE SUGGESTION THAT HER MOTHER MIGHT GO WITH HER BUT MISSUS KRONBORG WAS TOO WISE FOR THAT SHE KNEW THAT THEA WOULD HAVE A BETTER TIME IF SHE WENT ALONE
8430-172387-0023 AND SHE WATCHED HER DAUGHTER GO OUT OF THE GATE AND DOWN THE SIDEWALK THAT LED TO THE DEPOT THEA WALKED SLOWLY IT WAS A SOFT ROSY EVENING THE SAND HILLS WERE LAVENDER THE SUN HAD GONE DOWN A GLOWING COPPER DISK
8430-172387-0024 AND THE FLEECY CLOUDS IN THE EAST WERE A BURNING ROSE COLOR FLECKED WITH GOLD THEA PASSED THE COTTONWOOD GROVE AND THEN THE DEPOT WHERE SHE LEFT THE SIDEWALK AND TOOK THE SANDY PATH TOWARD MEXICAN TOWN
8430-172387-0025 SHE COULD HEAR THE SCRAPING OF VIOLINS BEING TUNED THE TINKLE OF MANDOLINS AND THE GROWL OF A DOUBLE BASS WHERE HAD THEY GOT A DOUBLE BASS SHE DID NOT KNOW THERE WAS ONE IN MOONSTONE
8430-172387-0026 SHE FOUND LATER THAT IT WAS THE PROPERTY OF ONE OF RAMAS'S YOUNG COUSINS WHO WAS TAKING IT TO UTAH WITH HIM TO CHEER HIM AT HIS JOB A THE MEXICANS NEVER WAIT UNTIL IT IS DARK TO BEGIN TO DANCE
8430-172387-0027 AND THEA HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE NEW HALL BECAUSE EVERY OTHER HOUSE IN THE TOWN WAS DESERTED EVEN THE BABIES HAD GONE TO THE BALL A NEIGHBOR WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO HOLD THE BABY WHILE THE MOTHER DANCED
8430-172387-0028 JOHNNY BOWED TO HER FROM THE PLATFORM AT THE END OF THE ROOM WHERE HE WAS PLAYING THE MANDOLIN ALONG WITH TWO FIDDLES AND THE BASS THE HALL WAS A LONG LOW ROOM WITH WHITEWASHED WALLS A FAIRLY TIGHT PLANK FLOOR
8430-172387-0029 WOODEN BENCHES ALONG THE SIDES AND A FEW BRACKET LAMPS SCREWED TO THE FRAME TIMBERS THERE MUST HAVE BEEN FIFTY PEOPLE THERE COUNTING THE CHILDREN THE MEXICAN DANCES WERE VERY MUCH FAMILY AFFAIRS
8430-172387-0030 THE FATHERS ALWAYS DANCED AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH THEIR LITTLE DAUGHTERS AS WELL AS WITH THEIR WIVES ONE OF THE GIRLS CAME UP TO GREET THEA HER DARK CHEEKS GLOWING WITH PLEASURE AND CORDIALITY
8430-172387-0031 AND INTRODUCED HER BROTHER WITH WHOM SHE HAD JUST BEEN DANCING YOU BETTER TAKE HIM EVERY TIME HE ASKS YOU SHE WHISPERED HE'S THE BEST DANCER HERE EXCEPT JOHNNY
8430-172387-0032 THEA SOON DECIDED THAT THE POOREST DANCER WAS HERSELF EVEN MISSUS TELLAMANTEZ WHO ALWAYS HELD HER SHOULDERS SO STIFFLY DANCED BETTER THAN SHE DID THE MUSICIANS DID NOT REMAIN LONG AT THEIR POST
8430-172387-0033 WHEN ONE OF THEM FELT LIKE DANCING HE CALLED SOME OTHER BOY TO TAKE HIS INSTRUMENT PUT ON HIS COAT AND WENT DOWN ON THE FLOOR JOHNNY WHO WORE A BLOUSY WHITE SILK SHIRT DID NOT EVEN PUT ON HIS COAT
8430-172387-0034 THE DANCES THE RAILROAD MEN GAVE IN FIREMEN'S HALL WERE THE ONLY DANCES THEA HAD EVER BEEN ALLOWED TO GO TO AND THEY WERE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THIS
8430-172387-0035 THE BOYS PLAYED ROUGH JOKES AND THOUGHT IT SMART TO BE CLUMSY AND TO RUN INTO EACH OTHER ON THE FLOOR FOR THE SQUARE DANCES THERE WAS ALWAYS THE BAWLING VOICE OF THE CALLER WHO WAS ALSO THE COUNTY AUCTIONEER
8430-172387-0036 THIS MEXICAN DANCE WAS SOFT AND QUIET THERE WAS NO CALLING THE CONVERSATION WAS VERY LOW THE RHYTHM OF THE MUSIC WAS SMOOTH AND ENGAGING THE MEN WERE GRACEFUL AND COURTEOUS
8430-172387-0037 SOME OF THEM THEA HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN OUT OF THEIR WORKING CLOTHES SMEARED WITH GREASE FROM THE ROUND HOUSE OR CLAY FROM THE BRICKYARD SOMETIMES WHEN THE MUSIC HAPPENED TO BE A POPULAR MEXICAN WALTZ SONG
8430-172387-0038 THE DANCERS SANG IT SOFTLY AS THEY MOVED THERE WERE THREE LITTLE GIRLS UNDER TWELVE IN THEIR FIRST COMMUNION DRESSES AND ONE OF THEM HAD AN ORANGE MARIGOLD IN HER BLACK HAIR JUST OVER HER EAR THEY DANCED WITH THE MEN AND WITH EACH OTHER
8430-172387-0039 THERE WAS AN ATMOSPHERE OF EASE AND FRIENDLY PLEASURE IN THE LOW DIMLY LIT ROOM AND THEA COULD NOT HELP WONDERING WHETHER THE MEXICANS HAD NO JEALOUSIES OR NEIGHBORLY GRUDGES AS THE PEOPLE IN MOONSTONE HAD
8430-172387-0040 THERE WAS NO CONSTRAINT OF ANY KIND THERE TO NIGHT BUT A KIND OF NATURAL HARMONY ABOUT THEIR MOVEMENTS THEIR GREETINGS THEIR LOW CONVERSATION THEIR SMILES RAMAS BROUGHT UP HIS TWO YOUNG COUSINS
8430-172387-0041 THEY WERE DRESSED ALIKE IN BLACK VELVET JACKETS AND SOFT SILK SHIRTS WITH OPAL SHIRT BUTTONS AND FLOWING BLACK TIES LOOPED THROUGH GOLD RINGS
8430-172387-0042 THEY HAD CHARMING MANNERS AND LOW GUITAR LIKE VOICES THEY KNEW ALMOST NO ENGLISH BUT A MEXICAN BOY CAN PAY A GREAT MANY COMPLIMENTS WITH A VERY LIMITED VOCABULARY
8430-172387-0043 THE RAMAS BOYS THOUGHT THEA DAZZLINGLY BEAUTIFUL THEY HAD NEVER SEEN A SCANDINAVIAN GIRL BEFORE AND HER HAIR AND FAIR SKIN BEWITCHED THEM
8430-172387-0044 WHITE AND GOLD LIKE EASTER THEY EXCLAIMED TO EACH OTHER
8430-172387-0045 THE ELDER WAS MORE CRAFTY HE ASKED MIGUEL RAMAS WHETHER THERE WOULD BE PLENTY MORE GIRLS LIKE THAT A SALT LAKE MAYBEE SILVO OVERHEARING GAVE HIS BROTHER A CONTEMPTUOUS GLANCE
8430-172387-0046 PLENTY MORE A PARAISO MAY BEE HE RETORTED WHEN THEY WERE NOT DANCING WITH HER THEIR EYES FOLLOWED HER OVER THE COIFFURES OF THEIR OTHER PARTNERS THAT WAS NOT DIFFICULT
8430-172387-0047 ONE BLONDE HEAD MOVING AMONG SO MANY DARK ONES THEA HAD NOT MEANT TO DANCE MUCH BUT THE RAMAS BOYS DANCED SO WELL AND WERE SO HANDSOME AND ADORING THAT SHE YIELDED TO THEIR ENTREATIES
8430-172387-0048 WHEN SHE SAT OUT A DANCE WITH THEM THEY TALKED TO HER ABOUT THEIR FAMILY AT HOME AND TOLD HER HOW THEIR MOTHER HAD ONCE PUNNED UPON THEIR NAME RAMA IN SPANISH MEANT A BRANCH THEY EXPLAINED
8430-172387-0049 ONCE WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE LADS THEIR MOTHER TOOK THEM ALONG WHEN SHE WENT TO HELP THE WOMEN DECORATE THE CHURCH FOR EASTER SOME ONE ASKED HER WHETHER SHE HAD BROUGHT ANY FLOWERS AND SHE REPLIED THAT SHE HAD BROUGHT HER RAMAS
8430-172387-0050 THIS WAS EVIDENTLY A CHERISHED FAMILY STORY WHEN IT WAS NEARLY MIDNIGHT
8430-172387-0051 HE BEGAN TO PUT OUT THE LIGHTS AND MISSUS TELLAMANTEZ LED THE WAY ACROSS THE SQUARE TO HER CASA THE RAMAS BROTHERS ESCORTED THEA AND AS THEY STEPPED OUT OF THE DOOR SILVO EXCLAIMED
8430-172387-0052 MOST OF THE COMPANY FOLLOWED MISSUS TELLAMANTEZ AND THEY SAT ABOUT ON THE GRAVEL IN HER LITTLE YARD WHILE SHE AND JOHNNY AND MISSUS MIGUEL RAMAS SERVED THE ICE CREAM
8430-172387-0053 THE YOUTHS LAY DOWN ON THE SHINING GRAVEL BESIDE HER ONE ON HER RIGHT AND ONE ON HER LEFT JOHNNY ALREADY CALLED THEM LOS ACOLITOS THE ALTAR BOYS THE TALK ALL ABOUT THEM WAS LOW AND INDOLENT
8430-172387-0054 ONE OF THE GIRLS WAS PLAYING ON JOHNNY'S GUITAR ANOTHER WAS PICKING LIGHTLY AT A MANDOLIN THE MOONLIGHT WAS SO BRIGHT THAT ONE COULD SEE EVERY GLANCE AND SMILE AND THE FLASH OF THEIR TEETH
8430-172387-0055 THE MOONFLOWERS OVER MISSUS TELLAMANTEZ'S DOOR WERE WIDE OPEN AND OF AN UNEARTHLY WHITE THE MOON ITSELF LOOKED LIKE A GREAT PALE FLOWER IN THE SKY AFTER ALL THE ICE CREAM WAS GONE
8430-172387-0056 JOHNNY APPROACHED THEA HIS GUITAR UNDER HIS ARM AND THE ELDER RAMAS BOY POLITELY GAVE UP HIS PLACE JOHNNY SAT DOWN TOOK A LONG BREATH STRUCK A FIERCE CHORD AND THEN HUSHED IT WITH HIS OTHER HAND
8430-172387-0057 NOW WE HAVE SOME LIL SERENATA EH YOU WAN A TRY WHEN THEA BEGAN TO SING INSTANT SILENCE FELL UPON THE COMPANY
8430-172387-0058 SHE FELT ALL THOSE DARK EYES FIX THEMSELVES UPON HER INTENTLY SHE COULD SEE THEM SHINE THE FACES CAME OUT OF THE SHADOW LIKE THE WHITE FLOWERS OVER THE DOOR
8430-172387-0059 SILVO DROPPED ON HIS BACK AND LAY LOOKING AT THE MOON UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS STILL LOOKING AT THEA WHEN SHE FINISHED THE FIRST VERSE THEA WHISPERED TO JOHNNY AGAIN I CAN DO IT BETTER THAN THAT
8430-172387-0060 SHE HAD SUNG FOR CHURCHES AND FUNERALS AND TEACHERS BUT SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE SUNG FOR A REALLY MUSICAL PEOPLE AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD EVER FELT THE RESPONSE THAT SUCH A PEOPLE CAN GIVE
8430-172387-0061 THEY TURNED THEMSELVES AND ALL THEY HAD OVER TO HER FOR THE MOMENT THEY CARED ABOUT NOTHING IN THE WORLD BUT WHAT SHE WAS DOING THEIR FACES CONFRONTED HER OPEN EAGER UNPROTECTED
8430-172387-0062 SHE FELT AS IF ALL THESE WARM BLOODED PEOPLE DEBOUCHED INTO HER MISSUS TELLAMANTEZ'S FATEFUL RESIGNATION JOHNNY'S MADNESS THE ADORATION OF THE BOY WHO LAY STILL IN THE SAND
8430-172387-0063 IN AN INSTANT THESE THINGS SEEMED TO BE WITHIN HER INSTEAD OF WITHOUT AS IF THEY HAD COME FROM HER IN THE FIRST PLACE WHEN SHE FINISHED HER LISTENERS BROKE INTO EXCITED MURMUR
8430-172387-0064 THE MEN BEGAN HUNTING FEVERISHLY FOR CIGARETTES FAMOS SERRANOS THE BARYTONE BRICKLAYER TOUCHED JOHNNY'S ARM GAVE HIM A QUESTIONING LOOK THEN HEAVED A DEEP SIGH
8430-172387-0065 JOHNNY DROPPED ON HIS ELBOW WIPING HIS FACE AND NECK AND HANDS WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF SENORITA HE PANTED IF YOU SING LIKE THAT ONCE IN THE CITY OF MEXICO THEY JUST A GO CRAZY
8430-172387-0066 IN THE CITY OF MEXICO THEY AIN'T A SIT LIKE STUMPS WHEN THEY HEAR THAT NOT A MUCH WHEN THEY LIKE
8430-172387-0067 HIS VOICE WAS THIN UNSTEADY HUSKY IN THE MIDDLE TONES BUT IT WAS DISTINCTLY A VOICE AND SOMETIMES HE MANAGED TO GET SOMETHING VERY SWEET OUT OF IT CERTAINLY IT MADE HIM HAPPY TO SING
8430-172387-0068 THEA KEPT GLANCING DOWN AT HIM AS HE LAY THERE ON HIS ELBOW HIS EYES SEEMED TWICE AS LARGE AS USUAL AND HAD LIGHTS IN THEM LIKE THOSE THE MOONLIGHT MAKES ON BLACK RUNNING WATER
8430-172387-0069 THEA REMEMBERED THE OLD STORIES ABOUT HIS SPELLS SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM WHEN HIS MADNESS WAS ON HIM BUT SHE FELT SOMETHING TONIGHT AT HER ELBOW THAT GAVE HER AN IDEA OF WHAT IT MIGHT BE LIKE
8430-172387-0070 FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE FULLY UNDERSTOOD THE CRYPTIC EXPLANATION THAT MISSUS TELLAMANTEZ HAD MADE TO DOCTOR ARCHIE LONG AGO THERE WERE THE SAME SHELLS ALONG THE WALK SHE BELIEVED SHE COULD PICK OUT THE VERY ONE
8430-172387-0071 THERE WAS THE SAME MOON UP YONDER AND PANTING AT HER ELBOW WAS THE SAME JOHNNY FOOLED BY THE SAME OLD THINGS WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED FAMOS THE BARYTONE MURMURED SOMETHING TO JOHNNY WHO REPLIED
8430-172387-0072 WE HAVE NO ALTO BUT ALL THE GIRLS CAN SING ALTO AND MAKE SOME NOISE THE WOMEN LAUGHED MEXICAN WOMEN OF THE POORER CLASS DO NOT SING LIKE THE MEN PERHAPS THEY ARE TOO INDOLENT
8430-172387-0073 IN THE EVENING WHEN THE MEN ARE SINGING THEIR THROATS DRY ON THE DOORSTEP OR AROUND THE CAMP FIRE BESIDE THE WORK TRAIN THE WOMEN USUALLY SIT AND COMB THEIR HAIR
8430-172387-0074 WHILE JOHNNY WAS GESTICULATING AND TELLING EVERYBODY WHAT TO SING AND HOW TO SING IT THEA PUT OUT HER FOOT AND TOUCHED THE CORPSE OF SILVO WITH THE TOE OF HER SLIPPER AREN'T YOU GOING TO SING SILVO SHE ASKED TEASINGLY
8430-172387-0075 NOT THIS NIGHT SENORITA HE PLEADED SOFTLY NOT THIS NIGHT HE DROPPED BACK AGAIN AND LAY WITH HIS CHEEK ON HIS RIGHT ARM THE HAND LYING PASSIVE ON THE SAND ABOVE HIS HEAD
8430-172387-0076 HOW DOES HE FLATTEN HIMSELF INTO THE GROUND LIKE THAT THEA ASKED HERSELF I WISH I KNEW IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE SOMEHOW
8430-172387-0077 ACROSS THE GULCH THE KOHLERS LITTLE HOUSE SLEPT AMONG ITS TREES A DARK SPOT ON THE WHITE FACE OF THE DESERT THE WINDOWS OF THEIR UPSTAIRS BEDROOM WERE OPEN
8430-172387-0078 AND PAULINA HAD LISTENED TO THE DANCE MUSIC FOR A LONG WHILE BEFORE SHE DROWSED OFF SHE WAS A LIGHT SLEEPER AND WHEN SHE WOKE AGAIN AFTER MIDNIGHT JOHNNY'S CONCERT WAS AT ITS HEIGHT
8430-172387-0079 SHE LAY STILL UNTIL SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER THEN SHE WAKENED FRITZ AND THEY WENT OVER TO THE WINDOW AND LEANED OUT THEY COULD HEAR CLEARLY THERE
8430-172387-0080 WHISPERED MISSUS KOHLER IT MUST BE ACH WUNDERSCHON FRITZ WAS NOT SO WIDE AWAKE AS HIS WIFE HE GRUNTED AND SCRATCHED ON THE FLOOR WITH HIS BARE FOOT

8430-172387-0083 JOHNNY'S REEDY TENOR THEY KNEW WELL
8430-172387-0084 THE OTHERS MIGHT BE ANYBODY OVER THERE JUST MEXICAN VOICES THEN AT THE APPOINTED AT THE ACUTE MOMENT THE SOPRANO VOICE LIKE A FOUNTAIN JET
8430-172387-0085 HOW IT LEAPED FROM AMONG THOSE DUSKY MALE VOICES HOW IT PLAYED IN AND ABOUT AND AROUND AND OVER THEM LIKE A GOLDFISH DARTING AMONG CREEK MINNOWS
8430-172387-0086 LIKE A YELLOW BUTTERFLY SOARING ABOVE A SWARM OF DARK ONES AH SAID MISSUS KOHLER SOFTLY
