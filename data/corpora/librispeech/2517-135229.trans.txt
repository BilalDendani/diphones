2517-135229-0000 SADNESS WHETHER FROM BEREAVEMENT OR DISAPPOINTMENT OR MISFORTUNE OF ANY KIND MAY LINGER ON THROUGH LIFE IN MY CASE HOWEVER THE MILDER AND MORE ENDURING FEELING OF SADNESS HAD NO SUFFICIENT CAUSE FOR EXISTENCE
2517-135229-0001 THE SIGHTS WHICH I HAD SEEN INSPIRED HORROR AND HORROR ONLY BUT WHEN THE FIRST RUSH OF THIS FEELING HAD PASSED THERE CAME A REACTION CALMNESS FOLLOWED AND THEN ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY LIFE HERE CONSPIRED TO PERPETUATE THAT CALM
2517-135229-0002 I HAD LIGHT AND LUXURY AND AMUSEMENTS AROUND ME THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF FACES ALL GREETING ME WITH CORDIAL AFFECTION AND THOUSANDS OF HANDS ALL READY TO PERFORM MY SLIGHTEST WISH ABOVE ALL THERE WAS ALMAH EVERYTHING COMBINED TO MAKE HER MOST DEAR TO ME
2517-135229-0003 MY LIFE HAD BEEN SUCH THAT I NEVER BEFORE HAD SEEN ANYONE WHOM I LOVED AND HERE ALMAH WAS THE ONE CONGENIAL ASSOCIATE IN A WHOLE WORLD OF ALIENS SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL AND GENTLE AND SYMPATHETIC AND I LOVED HER DEARLY EVEN BEFORE I UNDERSTOOD WHAT MY FEELINGS WERE
2517-135229-0004 ONE DAY I LEARNED ALL AND FOUND THAT SHE WAS MORE PRECIOUS TO ME THAN ALL THE WORLD IT WAS ONE JOM WHEN SHE DID NOT MAKE HER APPEARANCE AS USUAL ON ASKING AFTER HER I LEARNED THAT SHE WAS ILL AT THIS INTELLIGENCE THERE CAME OVER ME A FEELING OF SICKENING ANXIETY AND FEAR ALMAH ILL
2517-135229-0005 WHAT IF IT SHOULD PROVE SERIOUS COULD I ENDURE LIFE HERE WITHOUT HER SWEET COMPANIONSHIP OF WHAT VALUE WAS LIFE WITHOUT HER AND AS I ASKED MYSELF THESE QUESTIONS I LEARNED THAT ALMAH HAD BECOME DEARER TO ME THAN LIFE ITSELF AND THAT IN HER WAS ALL THE SUNSHINE OF MY EXISTENCE
2517-135229-0006 WHILE SHE WAS ABSENT LIFE WAS NOTHING ALL ITS VALUE ALL ITS LIGHT ITS FLAVOR ITS BEAUTY WERE GONE I FELT UTTERLY CRUSHED I FORGOT ALL ELSE SAVE HER ILLNESS AND ALL THAT I HAD ENDURED SEEMED AS NOTHING WHEN COMPARED WITH THIS
2517-135229-0007 IT SEEMED TO BE THE ONE SUBJECT OF INTEREST BESIDE WHICH ALL OTHERS WERE FORGOTTEN THE KOHEN WAS ABSORBED IN HER CASE ALL THE PHYSICIANS OF THE CITY WERE MORE OR LESS ENGAGED IN HER BEHALF AND THERE CAME FORWARD AS VOLUNTEERS EVERY WOMAN IN THE PLACE WHO HAD ANY KNOWLEDGE OF SICK DUTIES
2517-135229-0008 I WAS SOMEWHAT PERPLEXED HOWEVER AT THEIR MANNER THEY WERE CERTAINLY AGITATED AND INTENSELY INTERESTED YET NOT EXACTLY SAD INDEED FROM WHAT I HEARD IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THIS STRANGE PEOPLE REGARDED SICKNESS AS RATHER A BLESSING THAN OTHERWISE
2517-135229-0009 THIS HOWEVER DID NOT INTERFERE IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE WITH THE MOST INTENSE INTEREST IN HER AND THE MOST ASSIDUOUS ATTENTION THE KOHEN IN PARTICULAR WAS DEVOTED TO HER HE WAS ABSENT MINDED SILENT AND FULL OF CARE
2517-135229-0010 ON THE WHOLE I FELT MORE THAN EVER PUZZLED AND LESS ABLE THAN EVER TO UNDERSTAND THESE PEOPLE I LOVED THEM YET LOATHED THEM FOR THE KOHEN I HAD AT ONCE AFFECTION AND HORROR
2517-135229-0011 HE LOOKED LIKE AN ANXIOUS FATHER FULL OF TENDEREST LOVE FOR A SICK CHILD FULL ALSO OF DELICATE SYMPATHY WITH ME AND YET I KNEW ALL THE TIME THAT HE WAS QUITE CAPABLE OF PLUNGING THE SACRIFICIAL KNIFE IN ALMAH'S HEART AND OF EATING HER AFTERWARD BUT MY OWN THOUGHTS WERE ALL OF ALMAH
2517-135229-0012 I LEARNED HOW DEAR SHE WAS WITH HER THE BRIGHTNESS OF LIFE HAD PASSED WITHOUT HER EXISTENCE WOULD BE INTOLERABLE HER SWEET VOICE HER TENDER AND GRACIOUS MANNER HER SOFT TOUCH HER TENDER AFFECTIONATE SMILE
2517-135229-0013 HER MOURNFUL YET TRUSTFUL LOOK OH HEAVENS WOULD ALL THESE BE MINE NO MORE I COULD NOT ENDURE THE THOUGHT AT FIRST I WANDERED ABOUT SEEKING REST AND FINDING NONE AND AT LENGTH I SAT IN MY OWN ROOM AND PASSED THE TIME IN LISTENING
2517-135229-0014 IN QUESTIONING THE ATTENDANTS IN WONDERING WHAT I SHOULD DO IF SHE SHOULD BE TAKEN FROM ME AT LENGTH ON ONE BLESSED JOM THE KOHEN CAME TO ME WITH A BRIGHT SMILE OUR DARLING ALMAH IS BETTER SAID HE EAT I BESEECH YOU SHE IS VERY DEAR TO ALL OF US
2517-135229-0015 BUT NOW ALL DANGER IS PAST THE PHYSICIANS SAY THAT SHE WILL SOON BE WELL THERE WERE TEARS IN HIS EYES AS HE SPOKE IT MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE BRIGHT LIGHT BUT I ATTRIBUTED THIS TO HIS LOVING HEART AND I FORGOT THAT HE WAS A CANNIBAL
2517-135229-0016 I TOOK HIS HANDS IN MINE AND PRESSED THEM IN DEEP EMOTION HE LOOKED AT ME WITH A SWEET AND GENTLE SMILE I SEE IT ALL SAID HE IN A LOW VOICE YOU LOVE HER ATAM OR I PRESSED HIS HANDS HARDER BUT SAID NOTHING INDEED I COULD NOT TRUST MYSELF TO SPEAK
2517-135229-0017 I KNEW IT SAID HE IT IS BUT NATURAL YOU ARE BOTH OF A DIFFERENT RACE FROM US YOU ARE BOTH MUCH ALIKE AND IN FULL SYMPATHY WITH ONE ANOTHER THIS DRAWS YOU TOGETHER WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU I THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULD BE A FIT COMPANION FOR HER HERE
2517-135229-0018 THAT YOU WOULD LESSEN HER GLOOM AND THAT SHE WOULD BE PLEASANT TO YOU I FOUND OUT SOON THAT I WAS RIGHT AND I FELT GLAD FOR YOU AT ONCE SHOWED THE FULLEST SYMPATHY WITH ONE ANOTHER NEVER TILL YOU CAME WAS ALMAH HAPPY WITH US BUT SINCE YOU HAVE COME SHE HAS BEEN A DIFFERENT BEING
2517-135229-0019 AND THERE HAS BEEN A JOYOUSNESS IN HER MANNER THAT I NEVER SAW BEFORE YOU HAVE MADE HER FORGET HOW TO WEEP AND AS FOR YOURSELF I HOPE SHE HAS MADE YOUR LIFE IN THIS STRANGE LAND SEEM LESS PAINFUL ATAM OR AT ALL THIS I WAS SO FULL OF AMAZEMENT THAT I COULD NOT SAY ONE WORD
2517-135229-0020 PARDON ME CONTINUED HE IF I HAVE SAID ANYTHING THAT MAY SEEM LIKE AN INTRUSION UPON YOUR SECRET AND MOST SACRED FEELINGS
2517-135229-0021 I COULD NOT HAVE SAID IT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE DEEP AFFECTION I FEEL FOR ALMAH AND FOR YOU AND FOR THE REASON THAT I AM JUST NOW MORE MOVED THAN USUAL AND HAVE LESS CONTROL OVER MY FEELINGS SAYING THIS HE PRESSED MY HAND AND LEFT ME
2517-135229-0022 IT WAS NOT THE CUSTOM HERE TO SHAKE HANDS BUT WITH HIS USUAL AMIABILITY HE HAD ADOPTED MY CUSTOM AND USED IT AS NATURALLY AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN TO THE MANNER BORN I WAS ENCOURAGED NOW THE MILD KOHEN CAME OFTEN TO CHEER ME HE TALKED MUCH ABOUT ALMAH
2517-135229-0023 ABOUT HER SWEET AND GRACIOUS DISPOSITION THE LOVE THAT ALL FELT FOR HER THE DEEP AND INTENSE INTEREST WHICH HER ILLNESS HAD AROUSED IN ALL THIS HE SEEMED MORE LIKE A MAN OF MY OWN RACE THAN BEFORE
2517-135229-0024 AND IN HIS EAGER DESIRE FOR HER RECOVERY HE FAILED TO EXHIBIT THAT LOVE FOR DEATH WHICH WAS HIS NATURE SO IT SEEMED
2517-135229-0025 YET THIS DESIRE FOR HER RECOVERY DID NOT ARISE OUT OF ANY LACK OF LOVE FOR DEATH ITS TRUE CAUSE I WAS TO LEARN AFTERWARD AND I WAS TO KNOW THAT IF HE DESIRED ALMAH'S RECOVERY NOW IT WAS ONLY THAT SHE MIGHT LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO ENCOUNTER DEATH IN A MORE TERRIFIC FORM
2517-135229-0026 BUT JUST THEN ALL THIS WAS UNKNOWN AND I JUDGED HIM BY MYSELF AT LAST I LEARNED THAT SHE WAS MUCH BETTER AND WOULD BE OUT ON THE FOLLOWING JOM THIS INTELLIGENCE FILLED ME WITH A FEVER OF EAGER ANTICIPATION SO GREAT THAT I COULD THINK OF NOTHING ELSE
2517-135229-0027 SLEEP WAS IMPOSSIBLE I COULD ONLY WAIT AND TRY AS BEST I MIGHT TO QUELL MY IMPATIENCE AT LAST THE TIME CAME I SAT WAITING THE CURTAIN WAS DRAWN ASIDE I SPRANG UP AND HURRYING TOWARD HER I CAUGHT HER IN MY ARMS AND WEPT FOR JOY
2517-135229-0028 AH ME HOW PALE SHE LOOKED SHE BORE STILL THE MARKS OF HER ILLNESS SHE SEEMED DEEPLY EMBARRASSED AND AGITATED AT THE FERVOR OF MY GREETING WHILE I INSTEAD OF APOLOGIZING OR TRYING TO EXCUSE MYSELF ONLY GREW MORE AGITATED STILL
2517-135229-0029 OH ALMAH I CRIED I SHOULD HAVE DIED IF YOU HAD NOT COME BACK TO ME OH ALMAH I LOVE YOU BETTER THAN LIFE AND I NEVER KNEW HOW DEARLY I LOVED YOU TILL I THOUGHT THAT I HAD LOST YOU OH FORGIVE ME BUT I MUST TELL YOU AND DON'T WEEP DARLING
2517-135229-0030 SHE WAS WEEPING AS I SPOKE SHE SAID NOTHING BUT TWINED HER ARMS AROUND MY NECK AND WEPT ON MY BREAST AFTER THIS WE HAD MUCH TO SAY THAT WE HAD NEVER MENTIONED BEFORE
2517-135229-0031 I CANNOT TELL THE SWEET WORDS THAT SHE SAID TO ME BUT I NOW LEARNED THAT SHE HAD LOVED ME FROM THE FIRST WHEN I CAME TO HER IN HER LONELINESS WHEN SHE WAS HOMESICK AND HEARTSICK AND I CAME A KINDRED NATURE OF A RACE MORE LIKE HER OWN
2517-135229-0032 AND SHE SAW IN ME THE ONLY ONE OF ALL AROUND HER WHOM IT WAS POSSIBLE NOT TO DETEST AND THEREFORE SHE LOVED ME WE HAD MANY THINGS TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER AND LONG EXCHANGES OF CONFIDENCE TO MAKE
2517-135229-0033 SHE NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME TOLD ME ALL THE SORROW THAT SHE HAD ENDURED IN HER CAPTIVITY SORROW WHICH SHE HAD KEPT SILENT AND SHUT UP DEEP WITHIN HER BREAST AT FIRST HER LIFE HERE HAD BEEN SO TERRIBLE THAT IT HAD BROUGHT HER DOWN NEARLY TO DEATH
2517-135229-0034 AFTER THIS SHE HAD SUNK INTO DULL DESPAIR SHE HAD GROWN FAMILIAR WITH HORRORS AND LIVED IN A STATE OF UNNATURAL CALM FROM THIS MY ARRIVAL HAD ROUSED HER
2517-135229-0035 THE DISPLAY OF FEELING ON MY PART HAD BROUGHT BACK ALL HER OLD SELF AND ROUSED ANEW ALL THOSE FEELINGS WHICH IN HER HAD BECOME DORMANT THE DARKNESS THE BLOODSHED THE SACRIFICES ALL THESE AFFECTED ME AS THEY HAD ONCE AFFECTED HER I HAD THE SAME FEAR OF DEATH WHICH SHE HAD
2517-135229-0036 THEN SAID ALMAH I FELT THE FULL MEANING OF ALL THAT LIES BEFORE US WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT I ASKED ANXIOUSLY YOU SPEAK AS THOUGH THERE WERE SOMETHING YET WORSE THAN WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN YET NOTHING CAN POSSIBLY BE WORSE
2517-135229-0037 WE HAVE SEEN THE WORST LET US NOW TRY TO SHAKE OFF THESE GRISLY THOUGHTS AND BE HAPPY WITH ONE ANOTHER YOUR STRENGTH WILL SOON BE BACK AND WHILE WE HAVE ONE ANOTHER WE CAN BE HAPPY EVEN IN THIS GLOOM AH ME SAID ALMAH IT WOULD BE BETTER NOW TO DIE
2517-135229-0038 I COULD DIE HAPPY NOW SINCE I KNOW THAT YOU LOVE ME DEATH SAID I DO NOT TALK OF IT DO NOT MENTION THAT WORD IT IS MORE ABHORRENT THAN EVER NO ALMAH LET US LIVE AND LOVE LET US HOPE LET US FLY
2517-135229-0039 IMPOSSIBLE SAID SHE IN A MOURNFUL VOICE WE CANNOT FLY THERE IS NO HOPE WE MUST FACE THE FUTURE AND MAKE UP OUR MINDS TO BEAR OUR FATE FATE I REPEATED LOOKING AT HER IN WONDER AND IN DEEP CONCERN
2517-135229-0040 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY OUR FATE IS THERE ANYTHING MORE WHICH YOU KNOW AND WHICH I HAVE NOT HEARD YOU HAVE HEARD NOTHING SAID SHE SLOWLY AND ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN AND HEARD IS AS NOTHING COMPARED WITH WHAT LIES BEFORE US FOR YOU AND FOR ME THERE IS A FATE
2517-135229-0041 INCONCEIVABLE ABHORRENT TREMENDOUS A FATE OF WHICH I DARE NOT SPEAK OR EVEN THINK AND FROM WHICH THERE IS NO ESCAPE WHATEVER AS ALMAH SAID THIS SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH AN EXPRESSION IN WHICH TERROR AND ANGUISH WERE STRIVING WITH LOVE
2517-135229-0042 HER CHEEKS WHICH SHORTLY BEFORE HAD FLUSHED ROSY RED IN SWEET CONFUSION WERE NOW PALLID HER LIPS ASHEN
2517-135229-0043 I LOOKED AT HER IN WONDER AND COULD NOT SAY A WORD OH ATAM OR SAID SHE I AM AFRAID OF DEATH ALMAH SAID I WHY WILL YOU SPEAK OF DEATH WHAT IS THIS FATE WHICH YOU FEAR SO MUCH
2517-135229-0044 YOU AND I ARE SINGLED OUT I HAVE BEEN RESERVED FOR YEARS UNTIL ONE SHOULD BE FOUND WHO MIGHT BE JOINED WITH ME YOU CAME I SAW IT ALL AT ONCE I HAVE KNOWN IT DREADED IT TRIED TO FIGHT AGAINST IT BUT IT WAS OF NO USE
2517-135229-0045 OH ATAM OR OUR LOVE MEANS DEATH FOR THE VERY FACT THAT YOU LOVE ME AND I LOVE YOU SEALS OUR DOOM OUR DOOM WHAT DOOM THE SACRIFICE EXCLAIMED ALMAH WITH ANOTHER SHUDDER IN HER VOICE AND LOOK THERE WAS A TERRIBLE MEANING WHICH I COULD NOT FAIL TO TAKE
2517-135229-0046 I UNDERSTOOD IT NOW AND MY BLOOD CURDLED IN MY VEINS ALMAH CLUNG TO ME DESPAIRINGLY DO NOT LEAVE ME SHE CRIED DO NOT LEAVE ME I HAVE NO ONE BUT YOU THE SACRIFICE THE SACRIFICE
2517-135229-0047 IT IS OUR DOOM THE GREAT SACRIFICE AT THE END OF THE DARK SEASON IT IS AT THE AMIR WE MUST GO THERE TO MEET OUR DOOM THE AMIR I ASKED WHAT IS THAT
2517-135229-0048 OH SHE CRIED YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND THE SACRIFICE IS BUT A PART IT IS BUT THE BEGINNING
2517-135229-0049 THINK OF THAT WHICH COMES AFTER
2517-135229-0050 NOW THE FULL MEANING FLASHED UPON ME AND I SAW IT ALL
2517-135229-0051 OH HORROR HORROR HORROR OH HIDEOUS ABOMINATION AND DEED WITHOUT A NAME I COULD NOT SPEAK I CAUGHT HER IN MY ARMS AND WE BOTH WEPT PASSIONATELY THE HAPPINESS OF OUR LOVE WAS NOW DARKENED BY THIS TREMENDOUS CLOUD THAT LOWERED BEFORE US
2517-135229-0052 THE SHOCK OF THIS DISCOVERY WAS OVERPOWERING AND SOME TIME ELAPSED BEFORE I COULD RALLY FROM IT THOUGH ALMAH'S LOVE WAS SWEET BEYOND EXPRESSION
2517-135229-0053 AND THOUGH AS THE TIME PASSED I SAW THAT EVERY JOM SHE REGAINED MORE AND MORE OF HER FORMER HEALTH AND STRENGTH STILL I COULD NOT FORGET WHAT HAD BEEN REVEALED
2517-135229-0054 WE WERE HAPPY WITH ONE ANOTHER YET OUR HAPPINESS WAS CLOUDED AND AMID THE BRIGHTNESS OF OUR LOVE THERE WAS EVER PRESENT THE DREAD SPECTRE OF OUR APPALLING DOOM THESE FEELINGS HOWEVER GREW FAINTER
2517-135229-0055 HOPE IS EVER READY TO ARISE AND I BEGAN TO THINK THAT THESE PEOPLE THOUGH GIVEN TO EVIL WAYS WERE AFTER ALL KIND HEARTED AND MIGHT LISTEN TO ENTREATY ABOVE ALL THERE WAS THE KOHEN SO BENEVOLENT SO SELF DENYING SO AMIABLE SO SYMPATHETIC
2517-135229-0056 I COULD NOT FORGET ALL THAT HE HAD SAID DURING ALMAH'S ILLNESS AND IT SEEMED MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT AN APPEAL TO HIS BETTER NATURE MIGHT NOT BE WITHOUT EFFECT I SAID AS MUCH TO ALMAH THE KOHEN SAID SHE WHY HE CAN DO NOTHING
2517-135229-0057 WHY NOT HE IS THE CHIEF MAN HERE AND OUGHT TO HAVE GREAT INFLUENCE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID SHE WITH A SIGH THE KOHEN IS THE LOWEST AND LEAST INFLUENTIAL MAN IN THE CITY WHY WHO ARE INFLUENTIAL IF HE IS NOT I ASKED THE PAUPERS SAID ALMAH
2517-135229-0058 THE PAUPERS I EXCLAIMED IN AMAZEMENT YES SAID ALMAH HERE AMONG THESE PEOPLE THE PAUPERS FORM THE MOST HONORED INFLUENTIAL AND ENVIED PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY
