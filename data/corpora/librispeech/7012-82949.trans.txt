7012-82949-0000 WHEN AT LAST DAY STREAMED IN SILVER ACROSS THE PEAKS THE STORM HAD SPENT ITSELF BUT NOD DID NOT STIR NOR DRAW NEAR TO THE FIRE TO DRINK OF THE HOT PEPPER WATER THE TRAVELLERS HAD BREWED AGAINST THE COLD
7012-82949-0001 THUMB CAME AT LAST AND STOOPED OVER HIM GET UP NOW UMMANODDA LITTLE BROTHER AND DO NOT MOPE AND SULK ANY MORE I WAS ANGRY BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID
7012-82949-0002 AND HIS WONDERSTONE COME NEARER TO THE FIRE AND DRY YOUR SODDEN SHEEP'S COAT NOD CREPT FORLORNLY TO THE FIRE AND SAT THERE SHIVERING HE COULD NOT EAT
7012-82949-0003 THEY HAD COME BACK BRUISED AND BEDRAGGLED AND TORN WITH THORNS ONE OF THEM STUMBLING IN THE GLOOM ON THE GREEN ROCKS HAD FALLEN HEADLONG INTO THE CATARACT AND HAD NOT BEEN SEEN AGAIN
7012-82949-0004 WHILE THEY WERE HOBBLING BACK IN THE TORCHLESS DARKNESS TOWARDS THE BEACON ABOVE THE CATARACT THERE WAS NO WAY BEYOND THE RAVINE ALL WAS DENSE LOW FOREST ROCKS AND THORNS AND POURING WATERWAYS
7012-82949-0005 AND THE TRAVELLERS KNEW NOT WHAT TO BE DOING NOD COULD NOT BEAR TO LOOK AT THEM NOR LISTEN TO THEIR LISPING MOURNFUL VOICES
7012-82949-0006 WEARY OF HIS BROTHERS OF THE VERY DAYLIGHT BUT WEARIEST OF HIMSELF AFTER LONG PALAVER GHIBBA CAME SHUFFLING OVER TO HIM AND SAT DOWN BESIDE HIM IS THE MULLA MULGAR ILL THAT HE SITS ALONE HIDING HIS EYES HE SAID
7012-82949-0007 NOD SHOOK HIS HEAD I AM IN MY SECOND SLEEP MOUNTAIN MULGAR A LITTLE FROST HAS CANKERED MY BONES IT IS THE HARP NOD HEARS
7012-82949-0008 THE MULLA MULGARS SAY THERE CAN BE NO TURNING BACK NIZZA NEELA AND BY THE WAY I HAVE COME IT IS CERTAIN THAT THERE IS NO GOING ONWARD THEN SAY THEY BEING MULGARS OF A RACE
7012-82949-0009 WE MUST FLOAT WITH THE MOUNTAIN WATER INTO THE GREAT CAVERN AND TRUST OUR HEARTS TO THE FISHES MAYBE IT WILL CARRY US TO WHERE EVERY SHADOW COMES AT LAST MAYBE THESE ARE THE WATERS OF THE FOUNTAINS OF ASSASIMMON
7012-82949-0010 ALREADY MY PEOPLE ARE GATHERING BRANCHES SAID GHIBBA TO MAKE FLOATING MATS OR RAFTS SUCH AS I SAW ONE OF THE FISHING MULGARS SQUATTING ON WHILE HE DANGLED HIS TAIL FOR FISH BAIT
7012-82949-0011 TISHNAR WHO GUARDS YOU TISHNAR WHOSE PRINCE YOU ARE TISHNAR
7012-82949-0012 UTTS LIKE ME ON FRUITS OF SLEEPING TIME WILL NOT FORSAKE US NOW NOD TURNED COLD AND TREMBLING AS IF TO TELL THIS SOLEMN MAN OF THE MOUNTAINS THAT HIS WONDERSTONE WAS GONE BUT HE SWALLOWED HIS SPITTLE AND WAS ASHAMED
7012-82949-0013 THE STORM HAD SNAPPED AND STRIPPED OFF MANY BRANCHES FROM THE TREES THESE THE TRAVELLERS DRAGGED DOWN TO THE WATER OTHERS THEY HAULED DOWN WITH CULLUM ROPES AND SOME SMALLER SAPLINGS THEY CHARRED THROUGH WITH FIRE AT THE ROOT
7012-82949-0014 CULLUM AND ALL KINDS OF GREENERY GHIBBA AND THUMB BOUND THEM CLUMSILY ONE BY ONE TOGETHER LETTING THEM FLOAT OUT ON TO THE WATER UNTIL THE RAFT WAS LARGE AND BUOYANT ENOUGH TO BEAR TWO OR THREE MULGARS WITH THEIR BAGS FOR ONE GREAT RAFT
7012-82949-0015 BESIDES BEING HARDER FOR THESE IGNORANT SAILORS TO NAVIGATE THE TORRENT FLOWED SWIFTLY INTO THE CAVERN AND IF BUT TWO OR THREE SAILED IN TOGETHER FORTUNE MIGHT DROWN OR LOSE MANY IN THE DARK WINDINGS OF THE MOUNTAIN WATER
7012-82949-0016 BUT ONE OR TWO AT LEAST MIGHT ESCAPE THEY TOILED ON TILL EVENING BY WHICH TIME FOUR STRONG GREEN RAFTS BOBBED SIDE BY SIDE AT THEIR MOORING ROPES ON THE WATER THEN TIRED OUT SORE AND BLISTERED
7012-82949-0017 WITH THEIR DAY'S LABOURS THE TRAVELLERS HEAPED UP A GREAT WATCH FIRE ONCE MORE AND SUPPED MERRILY TOGETHER SINCE IT MIGHT BE FOR MANY OF THEM FOR THE LAST TIME
7012-82949-0018 CATARACT WISHING TO KEEP A BRAVE HEART FOR THE DANGERS BEFORE THEM ONLY NOD SAT GLOOMY AND DOWNCAST WAITING IMPATIENTLY TILL ALL SHOULD BE LYING FAST ASLEEP ONE BY ONE THE OUTWEARIED TRAVELLERS LAID THEMSELVES DOWN
7012-82949-0019 WITH THE PALMS OF THEIR FEET TOWARDS THE FIRE NOD HEARD THE CALLING OF THE BEASTS IN THE RAVINE AND EVER AND AGAIN FROM FAR UP THE MOUNTAIN SIDE BROKE OUT THE LONG HUNGRY HOWL OF THE LITTLE WOLVES
7012-82949-0020 ONLY NOD AND THE MOUNTAIN MULGAR WHOSE TURN IT WAS TO KEEP WATCH WERE NOW AWAKE HE WAS A QUEER OLD MULGAR BLIND OF ONE EYE BUT HE COULD STAND WIDE AWAKE FOR HOURS MUMBLING IN HIS MOUTH A SHAVING OF THEIR BLUE CHEESE RIND
7012-82949-0021 AND WHEN HE HAD TURNED HIS BACK FOR A MOMENT ON THE FIRE NOD WRIGGLED SOFTLY AWAY AND HOBBLING OFF INTO THE FOREST SOON REACHED THE WATER SIDE HE CREPT FORWARD UNDER THE GIGANTIC DRAGON TREE
7012-82949-0022 AND DOWN THE STEEP BANK TO THE LITTLE CREEK WHERE HE HAD FIRST HEARD THE SINGING OF THE WATER MIDDEN ALL WAS SHADOWY AND STILL ONLY THE DARK WATER MURMURED IN ITS STONY CHANNEL AND THE FAINT NIGHT WIND RUSTLED IN THE SEDGE
7012-82949-0023 NOD LEANED ON HIS BELLY OVER THE WATER AND GAZING INTO IT CALLED AS SOFTLY AND CLEARLY AS HIS HARSH VOICE COULD
7012-82949-0024 NO ONE ANSWERED HE STOOPED LOWER AND CALLED AGAIN IT IS ME THE MULLA MULGAR CHILD OF TISHNAR WHO TRUSTED TO YOU HIS WONDERSTONE BEAUTIFUL MIDDEN NOD WHO BELIEVED IN YOU CALLS YOUR FRIEND THE SORROWFUL NOD

7012-82949-0027 THE FISH LEAPT IN THE WATER AND CAUGHT THE LITTLE FRUIT IN ITS THIN CURVED TEETH AND NIBBLED GREEDILY TILL ALL WAS GONE WHEREUPON STARING SOLEMNLY AT NOD ONCE MORE HE LET THE LEAVES AND STALK FLOAT ONWARD WITH THE STREAM
7012-82949-0028 THEN WITH A FLASH AND FLICKER OF TAIL DIVED DOWN DOWN AND WAS GONE ALL AGAIN WAS SILENT ONLY THE BLAZING STARS AND THE SHADOWY PHANTOMS OF THE DISTANT FIRELIGHT MOVED ON THE WATER O TISHNAR
7012-82949-0029 MUTTERED THE LITTLE MULGAR TO HIMSELF HELP ONCE THIS WRETCHED NOD SUDDENLY AS HE WATCHED AS IF IT WERE THE AMBER OR IVORY BEAM OF A LANTERN IN THE WATER HE SAW A PALE BRIGHTNESS ASCENDING
7012-82949-0030 BUT HE SPOKE GENTLY FOR HE COULD NOT LOOK INTO HER BEAUTIFUL WILD FACE AND HER EYES THAT WERE LIKE THE FOREST FOR DARKNESS AND THE MOONLIT MOUNTAINS OF TISHNAR FOR LOVELINESS AND STILL BE ANGRY NOR EVEN SAD TELL ME O WATER MIDDEN

7012-82949-0036 AND LONG NO MORE FOR TISHNAR'S FOUNTAINS THEN THE MIDDEN FLOATED OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM AND WITH ONE LIGHT HAND KEPT HERSELF IN FRONT OF NOD
7012-82949-0037 INTO HER PALM THE ANGRY FLAMING WONDERSTONE SEE MULLA MULGAR HERE IS YOUR WONDERSTONE NOW IN PATIENCE TELL ME HOW TO MAKE MAGIC AND NOD SAID SOFTLY

7012-82949-0048 AND NOD COULD NOT THINK WHAT IN HIS TURN TO GIVE THE WATER MIDDEN FOR A REMEMBRANCE AND A KEEPSAKE SO HE GAVE HER BATTLE'S SILVER GROAT WITH THE HOLE IN IT
7012-82949-0049 AND HUNG IT UPON A SLENDER SHRED OF CULLUM ROUND HER NECK AND HE TORE OFF ALSO ONE OF THE FIVE OUT OF HIS NINE IVORY BUTTONS THAT STILL CLUNG TO HIS COAT AND GAVE HER THAT TOO
7012-82949-0050 AND HE SAID GOOD BYE TO HER KNEELING ABOVE THE DARK WATER BUT LONG AFTER HE HAD SAFELY WRAPPED HIS WONDERSTONE IN THE BLOOD STAINED LEAF FROM BATTLE'S LITTLE BOOK AGAIN
7012-82949-0051 AND NOW THE SUN SHONE DOWN SO FIERCELY THAT THE MULGARS CLIMBING HACKING DRAGGING AT THE BRANCHES AND MOILING TO AND FRO BETWIXT FOREST AND WATER TEASED BY FLIES AND STINGING ANTS HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO DO FOR THE HEAT
