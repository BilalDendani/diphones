783-126739-0000 CHAPTER TEN THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER DRIVEN RAPIDLY IN A HANSOM FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF SOHO IN THE DIRECTION OF WESTMINSTER GOT OUT AT THE VERY CENTRE OF THE EMPIRE ON WHICH THE SUN NEVER SETS
783-126739-0001 SOME STALWART CONSTABLES WHO DID NOT SEEM PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED BY THE DUTY OF WATCHING THE AUGUST SPOT SALUTED HIM PENETRATING THROUGH A PORTAL BY NO MEANS LOFTY INTO THE PRECINCTS OF THE HOUSE WHICH IS THE HOUSE
783-126739-0002 PAR EXCELLENCE IN THE MINDS OF MANY MILLIONS OF MEN HE WAS MET AT LAST BY THE VOLATILE AND REVOLUTIONARY TOODLES THAT NEAT AND NICE YOUNG MAN CONCEALED HIS ASTONISHMENT AT THE EARLY APPEARANCE OF THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
783-126739-0003 WHOM HE HAD BEEN TOLD TO LOOK OUT FOR SOME TIME ABOUT MIDNIGHT HIS TURNING UP SO EARLY HE CONCLUDED TO BE THE SIGN THAT THINGS WHATEVER THEY WERE HAD GONE WRONG
783-126739-0004 WITH AN EXTREMELY READY SYMPATHY WHICH IN NICE YOUNGSTERS GOES OFTEN WITH A JOYOUS TEMPERAMENT HE FELT SORRY FOR THE GREAT PRESENCE HE CALLED THE CHIEF AND ALSO FOR THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
783-126739-0005 WHOSE FACE APPEARED TO HIM MORE OMINOUSLY WOODEN THAN EVER BEFORE AND QUITE WONDERFULLY LONG WHAT A QUEER FOREIGN LOOKING CHAP HE IS HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF SMILING FROM A DISTANCE WITH FRIENDLY BUOYANCY
783-126739-0006 IT LOOKED AS IF THE GREAT ASSAULT THREATENED FOR THAT NIGHT WERE GOING TO FIZZLE OUT AN INFERIOR HENCHMAN OF THAT BRUTE CHEESEMAN WAS UP BORING MERCILESSLY A VERY THIN HOUSE WITH SOME SHAMELESSLY COOKED STATISTICS
783-126739-0007 HE TOODLES HOPED HE WOULD BORE THEM INTO A COUNT OUT EVERY MINUTE
783-126739-0008 ANYWAY THE CHIEF COULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO GO HOME HE WILL SEE YOU AT ONCE I THINK HE'S SITTING ALL ALONE IN HIS ROOM THINKING OF ALL THE FISHES OF THE SEA CONCLUDED TOODLES AIRILY COME ALONG
783-126739-0009 NOTWITHSTANDING THE KINDNESS OF HIS DISPOSITION THE YOUNG PRIVATE SECRETARY UNPAID WAS ACCESSIBLE TO THE COMMON FAILINGS OF HUMANITY HE DID NOT WISH TO HARROW THE FEELINGS OF THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
783-126739-0010 WHO LOOKED TO HIM UNCOMMONLY LIKE A MAN WHO HAS MADE A MESS OF HIS JOB BUT HIS CURIOSITY WAS TOO STRONG TO BE RESTRAINED BY MERE COMPASSION HE COULD NOT HELP
783-126739-0011 AND YOUR SPRAT GOT HIM ANSWERED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER WITH A CONCISION WHICH DID NOT MEAN TO BE REPELLENT IN THE LEAST GOOD YOU'VE NO IDEA HOW THESE GREAT MEN DISLIKE TO BE DISAPPOINTED IN SMALL THINGS
783-126739-0012 AFTER THIS PROFOUND OBSERVATION THE EXPERIENCED TOODLES SEEMED TO REFLECT AT ANY RATE HE SAID NOTHING FOR QUITE TWO SECONDS THEN I'M GLAD
783-126739-0013 DO YOU KNOW WHAT MAY BE DONE WITH A SPRAT THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER ASKED IN HIS TURN HE'S SOMETIMES PUT INTO A SARDINE BOX CHUCKLED TOODLES WHOSE ERUDITION ON THE SUBJECT OF THE FISHING INDUSTRY WAS FRESH
783-126739-0014 AND IN COMPARISON WITH HIS IGNORANCE OF ALL OTHER INDUSTRIAL MATTERS IMMENSE
783-126739-0015 THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER INTERRUPTED THE APPRENTICE STATESMAN YES YES BUT A SPRAT IS ALSO THROWN AWAY SOMETIMES IN ORDER TO CATCH A WHALE A WHALE PHEW EXCLAIMED TOODLES WITH BATED BREATH YOU'RE AFTER A WHALE THEN
783-126739-0016 NOT EXACTLY WHAT I AM AFTER IS MORE LIKE A DOG FISH YOU DON'T KNOW PERHAPS WHAT A DOG FISH IS LIKE YES I DO WE'RE BURIED IN SPECIAL BOOKS UP TO OUR NECKS WHOLE SHELVES FULL OF THEM WITH PLATES
783-126739-0017 IT'S A NOXIOUS RASCALLY LOOKING ALTOGETHER DETESTABLE BEAST WITH A SORT OF SMOOTH FACE AND MOUSTACHES DESCRIBED TO A T COMMENDED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER ONLY MINE IS CLEAN SHAVEN ALTOGETHER YOU'VE SEEN HIM
783-126739-0018 IT'S A WITTY FISH I HAVE SEEN HIM SAID TOODLES INCREDULOUSLY I CAN'T CONCEIVE WHERE I COULD HAVE SEEN HIM AT THE EXPLORERS I SHOULD SAY DROPPED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER CALMLY
783-126739-0019 AT THE NAME OF THAT EXTREMELY EXCLUSIVE CLUB TOODLES LOOKED SCARED AND STOPPED SHORT NONSENSE HE PROTESTED BUT IN AN AWE STRUCK TONE WHAT DO YOU MEAN A MEMBER
783-126739-0020 HONORARY MUTTERED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER THROUGH HIS TEETH HEAVENS TOODLES LOOKED SO THUNDERSTRUCK THAT THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER SMILED FAINTLY THAT'S BETWEEN OURSELVES STRICTLY HE SAID
783-126739-0021 THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER GAVE HIM AN UNSMILING GLANCE TILL THEY CAME TO THE DOOR OF THE GREAT MAN'S ROOM TOODLES PRESERVED A SCANDALISED AND SOLEMN SILENCE
783-126739-0022 AS THOUGH HE WERE OFFENDED WITH THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER FOR EXPOSING SUCH AN UNSAVOURY AND DISTURBING FACT IT REVOLUTIONISED HIS IDEA OF THE EXPLORERS CLUB'S EXTREME SELECTNESS OF ITS SOCIAL PURITY TOODLES WAS REVOLUTIONARY ONLY IN POLITICS
783-126739-0023 WHICH UPON THE WHOLE HE BELIEVED TO BE A NICE PLACE TO LIVE ON HE STOOD ASIDE GO IN WITHOUT KNOCKING HE SAID
783-126739-0024 SHADES OF GREEN SILK FITTED LOW OVER ALL THE LIGHTS IMPARTED TO THE ROOM SOMETHING OF A FOREST'S DEEP GLOOM THE HAUGHTY EYES WERE PHYSICALLY THE GREAT MAN'S WEAK POINT THIS POINT WAS WRAPPED UP IN SECRECY
783-126739-0025 THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER ENTERING SAW AT FIRST ONLY A BIG PALE HAND SUPPORTING A BIG HEAD AND CONCEALING THE UPPER PART OF A BIG PALE FACE AN OPEN DESPATCH BOX STOOD ON THE WRITING TABLE NEAR A FEW OBLONG SHEETS OF PAPER
783-126739-0026 AND A SCATTERED HANDFUL OF QUILL PENS THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE ON THE LARGE FLAT SURFACE EXCEPT A LITTLE BRONZE STATUETTE DRAPED IN A TOGA MYSTERIOUSLY WATCHFUL IN ITS SHADOWY IMMOBILITY
783-126739-0027 THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER INVITED TO TAKE A CHAIR SAT DOWN IN THE DIM LIGHT THE SALIENT POINTS OF HIS PERSONALITY THE LONG FACE THE BLACK HAIR HIS LANKNESS MADE HIM LOOK MORE FOREIGN THAN EVER
783-126739-0028 THE GREAT MAN MANIFESTED NO SURPRISE NO EAGERNESS NO SENTIMENT WHATEVER THE ATTITUDE IN WHICH HE RESTED HIS MENACED EYES WAS PROFOUNDLY MEDITATIVE HE DID NOT ALTER IT THE LEAST BIT
783-126739-0029 BUT HIS TONE WAS NOT DREAMY WELL WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'VE FOUND OUT ALREADY YOU CAME UPON SOMETHING UNEXPECTED ON THE FIRST STEP NOT EXACTLY UNEXPECTED SIR ETHELRED WHAT I MAINLY CAME UPON WAS A PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE
783-126739-0030 THE GREAT PRESENCE MADE A SLIGHT MOVEMENT YOU MUST BE LUCID PLEASE YES SIR ETHELRED
783-126739-0031 FEEL AN IRRESISTIBLE NEED OF CONFESSING OF MAKING A CLEAN BREAST OF IT TO SOMEBODY TO ANYBODY AND THEY DO IT OFTEN TO THE POLICE IN THAT VERLOC WHOM HEAT WISHED SO MUCH TO SCREEN I'VE FOUND A MAN IN THAT PARTICULAR PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE
783-126739-0032 THE MAN FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING FLUNG HIMSELF ON MY BREAST IT WAS ENOUGH ON MY PART TO WHISPER TO HIM WHO I WAS AND TO ADD I KNOW THAT YOU ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS AFFAIR
783-126739-0033 IT MUST HAVE SEEMED MIRACULOUS TO HIM THAT WE SHOULD KNOW ALREADY BUT HE TOOK IT ALL IN THE STRIDE THE WONDERFULNESS OF IT NEVER CHECKED HIM FOR A MOMENT
783-126739-0034 WHO PUT YOU UP TO IT AND WHO WAS THE MAN WHO DID IT HE ANSWERED THE FIRST WITH REMARKABLE EMPHASIS AS TO THE SECOND QUESTION I GATHER THAT THE FELLOW WITH THE BOMB WAS HIS BROTHER IN LAW QUITE A LAD A WEAK MINDED CREATURE
783-126739-0035 IT IS RATHER A CURIOUS AFFAIR TOO LONG PERHAPS TO STATE FULLY JUST NOW WHAT THEN HAVE YOU LEARNED ASKED THE GREAT MAN FIRST I'VE LEARNED THAT THE EX CONVICT MICHAELIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
783-126739-0036 THOUGH INDEED THE LAD HAD BEEN LIVING WITH HIM TEMPORARILY IN THE COUNTRY UP TO EIGHT O'CLOCK THIS MORNING IT IS MORE THAN LIKELY THAT MICHAELIS KNOWS NOTHING OF IT TO THIS MOMENT YOU ARE POSITIVE AS TO THAT ASKED THE GREAT MAN QUITE CERTAIN SIR ETHELRED
783-126739-0037 AND TOOK AWAY THE LAD ON THE PRETENCE OF GOING OUT FOR A WALK IN THE LANES AS IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT HE DID THIS MICHAELIS COULD NOT HAVE THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF ANYTHING UNUSUAL FOR THE REST SIR ETHELRED
783-126739-0038 THE INDIGNATION OF THIS MAN VERLOC HAD LEFT NOTHING IN DOUBT NOTHING WHATEVER HE HAD BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF HIS MIND ALMOST BY AN EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE
783-126739-0039 THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER THEN IMPARTED BRIEFLY TO THE GREAT MAN WHO SAT STILL RESTING HIS EYES UNDER THE SCREEN OF HIS HAND MISTER VERLOC'S APPRECIATION OF MISTER VLADIMIR'S PROCEEDINGS AND CHARACTER
783-126739-0040 THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER DID NOT SEEM TO REFUSE IT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF COMPETENCY BUT THE GREAT PERSONAGE REMARKED ALL THIS SEEMS VERY FANTASTIC DOESN'T IT ONE WOULD THINK A FEROCIOUS JOKE
783-126739-0041 BUT OUR MAN TOOK IT SERIOUSLY IT APPEARS HE FELT HIMSELF THREATENED
783-126739-0042 WITH OLD STOTT WARTENHEIM HIMSELF AND HAD COME TO REGARD HIS SERVICES AS INDISPENSABLE IT WAS AN EXTREMELY RUDE AWAKENING
783-126739-0043 HE BECAME ANGRY AND FRIGHTENED UPON MY WORD MY IMPRESSION IS THAT HE THOUGHT THESE EMBASSY PEOPLE QUITE CAPABLE
783-126739-0044 IN SOME MANNER OR OTHER HOW LONG WERE YOU WITH HIM INTERRUPTED THE PRESENCE FROM BEHIND HIS BIG HAND SOME FORTY MINUTES SIR ETHELRED IN A HOUSE OF BAD REPUTE CALLED CONTINENTAL HOTEL
783-126739-0045 CLOSETED IN A ROOM WHICH BY THE BY I TOOK FOR THE NIGHT I FOUND HIM UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THAT REACTION WHICH FOLLOWS THE EFFORT OF CRIME THE MAN CANNOT BE DEFINED AS A HARDENED CRIMINAL
783-126739-0046 IT IS OBVIOUS THAT HE DID NOT PLAN THE DEATH OF THAT WRETCHED LAD HIS BROTHER IN LAW THAT WAS A SHOCK TO HIM I COULD SEE THAT PERHAPS HE IS A MAN OF STRONG SENSIBILITIES PERHAPS HE WAS EVEN FOND OF THE LAD WHO KNOWS
783-126739-0047 HE MIGHT HAVE HOPED THAT THE FELLOW WOULD GET CLEAR AWAY IN WHICH CASE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BRING THIS THING HOME TO ANYONE AT ANY RATE
783-126739-0048 THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER PAUSED IN HIS SPECULATIONS TO REFLECT FOR A MOMENT THOUGH HOW IN THAT LAST CASE HE COULD HOPE TO HAVE HIS OWN SHARE IN THE BUSINESS CONCEALED IS MORE THAN I CAN TELL HE CONTINUED IN HIS IGNORANCE OF POOR STEVIE'S DEVOTION TO MISTER VERLOC
783-126739-0049 WHO WAS GOOD AND OF HIS TRULY PECULIAR DUMBNESS WHICH IN THE OLD AFFAIR OF FIREWORKS ON THE STAIRS HAD FOR MANY YEARS RESISTED ENTREATIES COAXING ANGER AND OTHER MEANS OF INVESTIGATION USED BY HIS BELOVED SISTER
783-126739-0050 BUT IN TRUTH THERE IS A SORT OF LUCIDITY PROPER TO EXTRAVAGANT LANGUAGE AND THE GREAT MAN WAS NOT OFFENDED A SLIGHT JERKY MOVEMENT OF THE BIG BODY HALF LOST IN THE GLOOM OF THE GREEN SILK SHADES
783-126739-0051 OF THE BIG HEAD LEANING ON THE BIG HAND ACCOMPANIED AN INTERMITTENT STIFLED BUT POWERFUL SOUND THE GREAT MAN HAD LAUGHED WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HIM THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER ANSWERED VERY READILY
783-126739-0052 YOU DID BUT THE FELLOW WILL DISAPPEAR PARDON ME I DON'T THINK SO WHERE COULD HE GO TO MOREOVER YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT HE HAS GOT TO THINK OF THE DANGER FROM HIS COMRADES TOO HE'S THERE AT HIS POST
783-126739-0053 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN LEAVING IT BUT EVEN IF THERE WERE NO OBSTACLES TO HIS FREEDOM OF ACTION HE WOULD DO NOTHING AT PRESENT HE HASN'T ENOUGH MORAL ENERGY TO TAKE A RESOLUTION OF ANY SORT PERMIT ME ALSO TO POINT OUT THAT IF I HAD DETAINED HIM
783-126739-0054 WE WOULD HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO A COURSE OF ACTION ON WHICH I WISHED TO KNOW YOUR PRECISE INTENTIONS FIRST THE GREAT PERSONAGE ROSE HEAVILY AN IMPOSING SHADOWY FORM IN THE GREENISH GLOOM OF THE ROOM
783-126739-0055 I'LL SEE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO NIGHT AND WILL SEND FOR YOU TO MORROW MORNING IS THERE ANYTHING MORE YOU'D WISH TO TELL ME NOW THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER HAD STOOD UP ALSO SLENDER AND FLEXIBLE I THINK NOT SIR ETHELRED UNLESS I WERE TO ENTER INTO DETAILS WHICH
783-126739-0056 NO NO DETAILS PLEASE THE GREAT SHADOWY FORM SEEMED TO SHRINK AWAY AS IF IN PHYSICAL DREAD OF DETAILS THEN CAME FORWARD EXPANDED ENORMOUS AND WEIGHTY OFFERING A LARGE HAND AND YOU SAY THAT THIS MAN HAS GOT A WIFE
783-126739-0057 YES SIR ETHELRED SAID THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER PRESSING DEFERENTIALLY THE EXTENDED HAND A GENUINE WIFE AND A GENUINELY RESPECTABLY MARITAL RELATION HE TOLD ME THAT AFTER HIS INTERVIEW AT THE EMBASSY HE WOULD HAVE THROWN EVERYTHING UP
783-126739-0058 ONLY HE FELT CERTAIN THAT HIS WIFE WOULD NOT EVEN HEAR OF GOING ABROAD NOTHING COULD BE MORE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE RESPECTABLE BOND THAN THAT WENT ON WITH A TOUCH OF GRIMNESS THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER WHOSE OWN WIFE TOO HAD REFUSED TO HEAR OF GOING ABROAD
783-126739-0059 YES A GENUINE WIFE AND THE VICTIM WAS A GENUINE BROTHER IN LAW FROM A CERTAIN POINT OF VIEW WE ARE HERE IN THE PRESENCE OF A DOMESTIC DRAMA THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER LAUGHED A LITTLE BUT THE GREAT MAN'S THOUGHTS SEEMED TO HAVE WANDERED FAR AWAY
783-126739-0060 PERHAPS TO THE QUESTIONS OF HIS COUNTRY'S DOMESTIC POLICY THE BATTLE GROUND OF HIS CRUSADING VALOUR AGAINST THE PAYNIM CHEESEMAN THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER WITHDREW QUIETLY UNNOTICED AS IF ALREADY FORGOTTEN
783-126739-0061 HE HAD HIS OWN CRUSADING INSTINCTS THIS AFFAIR WHICH IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER DISGUSTED CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT SEEMED TO HIM A PROVIDENTIALLY GIVEN STARTING POINT FOR A CRUSADE HE HAD IT MUCH AT HEART TO BEGIN
783-126739-0062 HE WALKED SLOWLY HOME MEDITATING THAT ENTERPRISE ON THE WAY AND THINKING OVER MISTER VERLOC'S PSYCHOLOGY IN A COMPOSITE MOOD OF REPUGNANCE AND SATISFACTION HE WALKED ALL THE WAY HOME
783-126739-0063 FINDING THE DRAWING ROOM DARK HE WENT UPSTAIRS AND SPENT SOME TIME BETWEEN THE BEDROOM AND THE DRESSING ROOM CHANGING HIS CLOTHES GOING TO AND FRO WITH THE AIR OF A THOUGHTFUL SOMNAMBULIST
783-126739-0064 BUT HE SHOOK IT OFF BEFORE GOING OUT AGAIN TO JOIN HIS WIFE AT THE HOUSE OF THE GREAT LADY PATRONESS OF MICHAELIS HE KNEW HE WOULD BE WELCOMED THERE ON ENTERING THE SMALLER OF THE TWO DRAWING ROOMS HE SAW HIS WIFE IN A SMALL GROUP NEAR THE PIANO
783-126739-0065 TO TWO THICK MEN WHOSE BACKS LOOKED OLD AND THREE SLENDER WOMEN WHOSE BACKS LOOKED YOUNG BEHIND THE SCREEN THE GREAT LADY HAD ONLY TWO PERSONS WITH HER A MAN AND A WOMAN WHO SAT SIDE BY SIDE ON ARM CHAIRS AT THE FOOT OF HER COUCH
783-126739-0066 SHE EXTENDED HER HAND TO THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER I NEVER HOPED TO SEE YOU HERE TO NIGHT ANNIE TOLD ME YES I HAD NO IDEA MYSELF THAT MY WORK WOULD BE OVER SO SOON
783-126739-0067 THE PATRONESS OF THE EX CONVICT RECEIVED THIS ASSURANCE INDIGNANTLY WHY WERE YOUR PEOPLE STUPID ENOUGH TO CONNECT HIM WITH NOT STUPID INTERRUPTED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER CONTRADICTING DEFERENTIALLY
783-126739-0068 CLEVER ENOUGH QUITE CLEVER ENOUGH FOR THAT A SILENCE FELL THE MAN AT THE FOOT OF THE COUCH HAD STOPPED SPEAKING TO THE LADY AND LOOKED ON WITH A FAINT SMILE
783-126739-0069 I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU EVER MET BEFORE SAID THE GREAT LADY MISTER VLADIMIR AND THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER INTRODUCED ACKNOWLEDGED EACH OTHER'S EXISTENCE WITH PUNCTILIOUS AND GUARDED COURTESY
783-126739-0070 HE'S BEEN FRIGHTENING ME DECLARED SUDDENLY THE LADY WHO SAT BY THE SIDE OF MISTER VLADIMIR
783-126739-0071 THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER KNEW THE LADY YOU DO NOT LOOK FRIGHTENED HE PRONOUNCED AFTER SURVEYING HER CONSCIENTIOUSLY WITH HIS TIRED AND EQUABLE GAZE HE WAS THINKING MEANTIME TO HIMSELF THAT IN THIS HOUSE
783-126739-0072 ONE MET EVERYBODY SOONER OR LATER MISTER VLADIMIR'S ROSY COUNTENANCE WAS WREATHED IN SMILES BECAUSE HE WAS WITTY BUT HIS EYES REMAINED SERIOUS LIKE THE EYES OF CONVINCED MAN WELL HE TRIED TO AT LEAST
783-126739-0073 AMENDED THE LADY FORCE OF HABIT PERHAPS SAID THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER MOVED BY AN IRRESISTIBLE INSPIRATION HE HAS BEEN THREATENING SOCIETY WITH ALL SORTS OF HORRORS CONTINUED THE LADY
783-126739-0074 WHOSE ENUNCIATION WAS CARESSING AND SLOW APROPOS OF THIS EXPLOSION IN GREENWICH PARK IT APPEARS WE ALL OUGHT TO QUAKE IN OUR SHOES AT WHAT'S COMING IF THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT SUPPRESSED ALL OVER THE WORLD I HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS SUCH A GRAVE AFFAIR
783-126739-0075 MISTER VLADIMIR AFFECTING NOT TO LISTEN LEANED TOWARDS THE COUCH TALKING AMIABLY IN SUBDUED TONES BUT HE HEARD THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER SAY I'VE NO DOUBT THAT MISTER VLADIMIR HAS A VERY PRECISE NOTION OF THE TRUE IMPORTANCE OF THIS AFFAIR
783-126739-0076 MISTER VLADIMIR ASKED HIMSELF WHAT THAT CONFOUNDED AND INTRUSIVE POLICEMAN WAS DRIVING AT DESCENDED FROM GENERATIONS VICTIMISED BY THE INSTRUMENTS OF AN ARBITRARY POWER HE WAS RACIALLY
783-126739-0077 NATIONALLY AND INDIVIDUALLY AFRAID OF THE POLICE IT WAS AN INHERITED WEAKNESS ALTOGETHER INDEPENDENT OF HIS JUDGMENT OF HIS REASON OF HIS EXPERIENCE HE WAS BORN TO IT
783-126739-0078 BUT THAT SENTIMENT WHICH RESEMBLED THE IRRATIONAL HORROR SOME PEOPLE HAVE OF CATS DID NOT STAND IN THE WAY OF HIS IMMENSE CONTEMPT FOR THE ENGLISH POLICE HE FINISHED THE SENTENCE ADDRESSED TO THE GREAT LADY AND TURNED SLIGHTLY IN HIS CHAIR
783-126739-0079 YOU MEAN THAT WE HAVE A GREAT EXPERIENCE OF THESE PEOPLE YES INDEED WE SUFFER GREATLY FROM THEIR ACTIVITY WHILE YOU MISTER VLADIMIR HESITATED FOR A MOMENT IN SMILING PERPLEXITY WHILE YOU SUFFER THEIR PRESENCE GLADLY IN YOUR MIDST
783-126739-0080 HE FINISHED DISPLAYING A DIMPLE ON EACH CLEAN SHAVEN CHEEK THEN HE ADDED MORE GRAVELY I MAY EVEN SAY BECAUSE YOU DO WHEN MISTER VLADIMIR CEASED SPEAKING THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER LOWERED HIS GLANCE
783-126739-0081 AND THE CONVERSATION DROPPED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS MISTER VLADIMIR TOOK LEAVE DIRECTLY HIS BACK WAS TURNED ON THE COUCH THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER ROSE TOO
783-126739-0082 I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO STAY AND TAKE ANNIE HOME SAID THE LADY PATRONESS OF MICHAELIS I FIND THAT I'VE YET A LITTLE WORK TO DO TO NIGHT IN CONNECTION
783-126739-0083 WELL YES IN A WAY TELL ME WHAT IS IT REALLY THIS HORROR IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT IT IS BUT IT MAY YET BE A CAUSE CELEBRE SAID THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
783-126739-0084 HE LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM HURRIEDLY AND FOUND MISTER VLADIMIR STILL IN THE HALL WRAPPING UP HIS THROAT CAREFULLY IN A LARGE SILK HANDKERCHIEF BEHIND HIM A FOOTMAN WAITED HOLDING HIS OVERCOAT ANOTHER STOOD READY TO OPEN THE DOOR
783-126739-0085 THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER WAS DULY HELPED INTO HIS COAT AND LET OUT AT ONCE AFTER DESCENDING THE FRONT STEPS HE STOPPED AS IF TO CONSIDER THE WAY HE SHOULD TAKE ON SEEING THIS THROUGH THE DOOR HELD OPEN MISTER VLADIMIR LINGERED IN THE HALL TO GET OUT A CIGAR
783-126739-0086 AND ASKED FOR A LIGHT IT WAS FURNISHED TO HIM BY AN ELDERLY MAN OUT OF LIVERY WITH AN AIR OF CALM SOLICITUDE BUT THE MATCH WENT OUT THE FOOTMAN THEN CLOSED THE DOOR AND MISTER VLADIMIR LIGHTED HIS LARGE HAVANA WITH LEISURELY CARE
783-126739-0087 WHEN AT LAST HE GOT OUT OF THE HOUSE HE SAW WITH DISGUST THE CONFOUNDED POLICEMAN STILL STANDING ON THE PAVEMENT CAN HE BE WAITING FOR ME THOUGHT MISTER VLADIMIR LOOKING UP AND DOWN FOR SOME SIGNS OF A HANSOM
783-126739-0088 HE SAW NONE A COUPLE OF CARRIAGES WAITED BY THE CURBSTONE THEIR LAMPS BLAZING STEADILY THE HORSES STANDING PERFECTLY STILL AS IF CARVED IN STONE
783-126739-0089 WITHOUT AS MUCH AS A QUIVER STIRRING THE WHITE THONGS OF THEIR BIG WHIPS MISTER VLADIMIR WALKED ON AND THE CONFOUNDED POLICEMAN FELL INTO STEP AT HIS ELBOW HE SAID NOTHING
783-126739-0090 AT THE END OF THE FOURTH STRIDE MISTER VLADIMIR FELT INFURIATED AND UNEASY THIS COULD NOT LAST ROTTEN WEATHER HE GROWLED SAVAGELY MILD SAID THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER WITHOUT PASSION
783-126739-0091 HE REMAINED SILENT FOR A LITTLE WHILE WE'VE GOT HOLD OF A MAN CALLED VERLOC HE ANNOUNCED CASUALLY
783-126739-0092 BUT HE COULD NOT PREVENT HIMSELF FROM EXCLAIMING WHAT THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER DID NOT REPEAT HIS STATEMENT YOU KNOW HIM HE WENT ON IN THE SAME TONE MISTER VLADIMIR STOPPED AND BECAME GUTTURAL
783-126739-0093 WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT I DON'T IT'S VERLOC WHO SAYS THAT A LYING DOG OF SOME SORT SAID MISTER VLADIMIR IN SOMEWHAT ORIENTAL PHRASEOLOGY
783-126739-0094 BUT IN HIS HEART HE WAS ALMOST AWED BY THE MIRACULOUS CLEVERNESS OF THE ENGLISH POLICE THE CHANGE OF HIS OPINION ON THE SUBJECT WAS SO VIOLENT THAT IT MADE HIM FOR A MOMENT FEEL SLIGHTLY SICK HE THREW AWAY HIS CIGAR AND MOVED ON
783-126739-0095 WHAT PLEASED ME MOST IN THIS AFFAIR THE ASSISTANT WENT ON TALKING SLOWLY
783-126739-0096 IN MY OPINION THEY ARE A GHASTLY NUISANCE ALSO AN ELEMENT OF DANGER BUT WE CAN'T VERY WELL SEEK THEM OUT INDIVIDUALLY THE ONLY WAY IS TO MAKE THEIR EMPLOYMENT UNPLEASANT TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
783-126739-0097 THE THING'S BECOMING INDECENT AND DANGEROUS TOO FOR US HERE MISTER VLADIMIR STOPPED AGAIN FOR A MOMENT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
783-126739-0098 THE PROSECUTION OF THIS VERLOC WILL DEMONSTRATE TO THE PUBLIC BOTH THE DANGER AND THE INDECENCY NOBODY WILL BELIEVE WHAT A MAN OF THAT SORT SAYS SAID MISTER VLADIMIR CONTEMPTUOUSLY
783-126739-0099 THE WEALTH AND PRECISION OF DETAIL WILL CARRY CONVICTION TO THE GREAT MASS OF THE PUBLIC ADVANCED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER GENTLY
783-126739-0100 WE'VE GOT THE MAN WE HAVE NO CHOICE
783-126739-0101 WHAT DO YOU WANT TO MAKE A SCANDAL FOR FROM MORALITY OR WHAT MISTER VLADIMIR'S ANXIETY WAS OBVIOUS THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER HAVING ASCERTAINED IN THIS WAY THAT THERE MUST BE SOME TRUTH IN THE SUMMARY STATEMENTS OF MISTER VERLOC
783-126739-0102 SAID INDIFFERENTLY THERE'S A PRACTICAL SIDE TOO WE HAVE REALLY ENOUGH TO DO TO LOOK AFTER THE GENUINE ARTICLE YOU CAN'T SAY WE ARE NOT EFFECTIVE
783-126739-0103 MISTER VLADIMIR'S TONE BECAME LOFTY FOR MY PART I CAN'T SHARE YOUR VIEW IT IS SELFISH MY SENTIMENTS FOR MY OWN COUNTRY CANNOT BE DOUBTED BUT I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT WE OUGHT TO BE GOOD EUROPEANS BESIDES
783-126739-0104 I MEAN GOVERNMENTS AND MEN YES SAID THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER SIMPLY ONLY YOU LOOK AT EUROPE FROM ITS OTHER END
783-126739-0105 THE FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS CANNOT COMPLAIN OF THE INEFFICIENCY OF OUR POLICE LOOK AT THIS OUTRAGE
783-126739-0106 IN LESS THAN TWELVE HOURS WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE IDENTITY OF A MAN LITERALLY BLOWN TO SHREDS HAVE FOUND THE ORGANISER OF THE ATTEMPT AND HAVE HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE INCITER BEHIND HIM
783-126739-0107 SO THIS INSTRUCTIVE CRIME WAS PLANNED ABROAD MISTER VLADIMIR SAID QUICKLY YOU ADMIT IT WAS PLANNED ABROAD THEORETICALLY THEORETICALLY ONLY ON FOREIGN TERRITORY ABROAD ONLY BY A FICTION SAID THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
783-126739-0108 YOU SEE THAT WE ARE NOT SO BAD I WANTED PARTICULARLY TO TELL YOU OF OUR SUCCESS I'M SURE I'M VERY GRATEFUL MUTTERED MISTER VLADIMIR THROUGH HIS TEETH
783-126739-0109 AS THOUGH HE WERE QUOTING CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT ALL THAT'S WANTED NOW IS TO DO AWAY WITH THE AGENT PROVOCATEUR TO MAKE EVERYTHING SAFE MISTER VLADIMIR HELD UP HIS HAND TO A PASSING HANSOM
783-126739-0110 YOU'RE NOT GOING IN HERE REMARKED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER LOOKING AT A BUILDING OF NOBLE PROPORTIONS AND HOSPITABLE ASPECT WITH THE LIGHT OF A GREAT HALL FALLING THROUGH ITS GLASS DOORS ON A BROAD FLIGHT OF STEPS
783-126739-0111 BUT MISTER VLADIMIR SITTING STONY EYED INSIDE THE HANSOM DROVE OFF WITHOUT A WORD THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER HIMSELF DID NOT TURN INTO THE NOBLE BUILDING IT WAS THE EXPLORERS CLUB
783-126739-0112 THE THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH HIS MIND THAT MISTER VLADIMIR HONORARY MEMBER WOULD NOT BE SEEN VERY OFTEN THERE IN THE FUTURE HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH IT WAS ONLY HALF PAST TEN
