64-73712-0006 THEY IMMEDIATELY DESCENDED AND ASSISTED THE ASSEMBLED HOUSEHOLD OF THE BOWER TO DISEMBARK THE CONTENTS OF THE CHARIOT BUT MISTER TEMPLE AND HIS DAUGHTER WERE TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH LADY BELLAIR'S CHARACTER TO APPEAR AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT
64-73712-0007 FIRST CAME FORTH A STATELY DAME OF AMPLE PROPORTIONS AND EXCEEDINGLY MAGNIFICENT ATTIRE BEING DRESSED IN THE EXTREME OF GORGEOUS FASHION AND WHO AFTER BEING LANDED ON THE MARBLE STEPS WAS FOR SOME MOMENTS ABSORBED IN THE FLUTTERING ARRANGEMENT OF HER PLUMAGE
