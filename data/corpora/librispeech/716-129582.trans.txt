716-129582-0000 BUT THE ISLANDERS SEEING THAT I WAS REALLY ADRIFT TOOK PITY ON ME I DRIFTED VERY SLOWLY TO THE EASTWARD APPROACHING THE ISLAND SLANTINGLY AND PRESENTLY I SAW WITH HYSTERICAL RELIEF THE LAUNCH COME ROUND AND RETURN TOWARDS ME
716-129582-0001 BROAD SHOULDERED COMPANION SITTING CRAMPED UP WITH THE DOGS AND SEVERAL PACKING CASES IN THE STERN SHEETS THIS INDIVIDUAL STARED FIXEDLY AT ME WITHOUT MOVING OR SPEAKING THE BLACK FACED CRIPPLE WAS GLARING AT ME AS FIXEDLY IN THE BOWS NEAR THE PUMA
716-129582-0002 THERE WERE THREE OTHER MEN BESIDES THREE STRANGE BRUTISH LOOKING FELLOWS AT WHOM THE STAGHOUNDS WERE SNARLING SAVAGELY MONTGOMERY WHO WAS STEERING BROUGHT THE BOAT BY ME AND RISING CAUGHT AND FASTENED MY PAINTER TO THE TILLER TO TOW ME
716-129582-0003 FOR THERE WAS NO ROOM ABOARD I HAD RECOVERED FROM MY HYSTERICAL PHASE BY THIS TIME AND ANSWERED HIS HAIL AS HE APPROACHED BRAVELY ENOUGH
716-129582-0004 I WAS JERKED BACK AS THE ROPE TIGHTENED BETWEEN THE BOATS
716-129582-0005 FOR THE WATER IN THE DINGEY HAD BEEN SHIPPED
716-129582-0006 THE WHITE HAIRED MAN I FOUND WAS STILL REGARDING ME STEADFASTLY
716-129582-0007 OF SOME PERPLEXITY WHEN MY EYES MET HIS HE LOOKED DOWN AT THE STAGHOUND THAT SAT BETWEEN HIS KNEES HE WAS A POWERFULLY BUILT MAN AS I HAVE SAID WITH A FINE FOREHEAD AND RATHER HEAVY FEATURES
716-129582-0008 BUT HIS EYES HAD THAT ODD DROOPING OF THE SKIN ABOVE THE LIDS WHICH OFTEN COMES WITH ADVANCING YEARS AND THE FALL OF HIS HEAVY MOUTH AT THE CORNERS GAVE HIM AN EXPRESSION OF PUGNACIOUS RESOLUTION HE TALKED TO MONTGOMERY IN A TONE TOO LOW FOR ME TO HEAR
716-129582-0009 FROM HIM MY EYES TRAVELLED TO HIS THREE MEN AND A STRANGE CREW THEY WERE I SAW ONLY THEIR FACES YET THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THEIR FACES I KNEW NOT WHAT THAT GAVE ME A QUEER SPASM OF DISGUST I LOOKED STEADILY AT THEM
716-129582-0010 AND THE IMPRESSION DID NOT PASS THOUGH I FAILED TO SEE WHAT HAD OCCASIONED IT THEY SEEMED TO ME THEN TO BE BROWN MEN
716-129582-0011 I HAVE NEVER SEEN MEN SO WRAPPED UP BEFORE AND WOMEN SO ONLY IN THE EAST THEY WORE TURBANS TOO AND THEREUNDER PEERED OUT THEIR ELFIN FACES AT ME FACES WITH PROTRUDING LOWER JAWS AND BRIGHT EYES THEY HAD LANK BLACK HAIR
716-129582-0012 ALMOST LIKE HORSEHAIR AND SEEMED AS THEY SAT
716-129582-0013 THE WHITE HAIRED MAN WHO I KNEW WAS A GOOD SIX FEET IN HEIGHT SAT A HEAD BELOW ANY ONE OF THE THREE I FOUND AFTERWARDS THAT REALLY NONE WERE TALLER THAN MYSELF BUT THEIR BODIES WERE ABNORMALLY LONG AND THE THIGH PART OF THE LEG SHORT AND CURIOUSLY TWISTED
716-129582-0014 AT ANY RATE THEY WERE AN AMAZINGLY UGLY GANG AND OVER THE HEADS OF THEM UNDER THE FORWARD LUG PEERED THE BLACK FACE OF THE MAN WHOSE EYES WERE LUMINOUS IN THE DARK AS I STARED AT THEM THEY MET MY GAZE
716-129582-0015 AND THEN FIRST ONE AND THEN ANOTHER TURNED AWAY FROM MY DIRECT STARE AND LOOKED AT ME IN AN ODD FURTIVE MANNER
716-129582-0016 AND I TURNED MY ATTENTION TO THE ISLAND WE WERE APPROACHING IT WAS LOW AND COVERED WITH THICK VEGETATION CHIEFLY A KIND OF PALM THAT WAS NEW TO ME FROM ONE POINT A THIN WHITE THREAD OF VAPOUR ROSE SLANTINGLY TO AN IMMENSE HEIGHT
716-129582-0017 AND THEN FRAYED OUT LIKE A DOWN FEATHER WE WERE NOW WITHIN THE EMBRACE OF A BROAD BAY FLANKED ON EITHER HAND BY A LOW PROMONTORY THE BEACH WAS OF DULL GREY SAND AND SLOPED STEEPLY UP TO A RIDGE PERHAPS SIXTY OR SEVENTY FEET ABOVE THE SEA LEVEL
716-129582-0018 AND IRREGULARLY SET WITH TREES AND UNDERGROWTH HALF WAY UP WAS A SQUARE ENCLOSURE OF SOME GREYISH STONE WHICH I FOUND SUBSEQUENTLY WAS BUILT PARTLY OF CORAL AND PARTLY OF PUMICEOUS LAVA TWO THATCHED ROOFS PEEPED FROM WITHIN THIS ENCLOSURE
716-129582-0019 A MAN STOOD AWAITING US AT THE WATER'S EDGE I FANCIED WHILE WE WERE STILL FAR OFF THAT I SAW SOME OTHER AND VERY GROTESQUE LOOKING CREATURES SCUTTLE INTO THE BUSHES UPON THE SLOPE BUT I SAW NOTHING OF THESE AS WE DREW NEARER
716-129582-0020 HE HAD A LARGE ALMOST LIPLESS MOUTH EXTRAORDINARY LANK ARMS LONG THIN FEET AND BOW LEGS AND STOOD WITH HIS HEAVY FACE THRUST FORWARD STARING AT US HE WAS DRESSED LIKE MONTGOMERY AND HIS WHITE HAIRED COMPANION IN JACKET AND TROUSERS OF BLUE SERGE
716-129582-0021 AS WE CAME STILL NEARER THIS INDIVIDUAL BEGAN TO RUN TO AND FRO ON THE BEACH MAKING THE MOST GROTESQUE MOVEMENTS AT A WORD OF COMMAND FROM MONTGOMERY THE FOUR MEN IN THE LAUNCH SPRANG UP AND WITH SINGULARLY AWKWARD GESTURES STRUCK THE LUGS
716-129582-0022 MONTGOMERY STEERED US ROUND AND INTO A NARROW LITTLE DOCK EXCAVATED IN THE BEACH THEN THE MAN ON THE BEACH HASTENED TOWARDS US THIS DOCK AS I CALL IT WAS REALLY A MERE DITCH JUST LONG ENOUGH AT THIS PHASE OF THE TIDE TO TAKE THE LONGBOAT
716-129582-0023 I HEARD THE BOWS GROUND IN THE SAND STAVED THE DINGEY OFF THE RUDDER OF THE BIG BOAT WITH MY PIGGIN AND FREEING THE PAINTER LANDED THE THREE MUFFLED MEN WITH THE CLUMSIEST MOVEMENTS SCRAMBLED OUT UPON THE SAND AND FORTHWITH SET TO LANDING THE CARGO
716-129582-0024 ASSISTED BY THE MAN ON THE BEACH I WAS STRUCK ESPECIALLY BY THE CURIOUS MOVEMENTS OF THE LEGS OF THE THREE SWATHED AND BANDAGED BOATMEN NOT STIFF THEY WERE BUT DISTORTED IN SOME ODD WAY ALMOST AS IF THEY WERE JOINTED IN THE WRONG PLACE
716-129582-0025 THE DOGS WERE STILL SNARLING AND STRAINED AT THEIR CHAINS AFTER THESE MEN AS THE WHITE HAIRED MAN LANDED WITH THEM THE THREE BIG FELLOWS SPOKE TO ONE ANOTHER IN ODD GUTTURAL TONES AND THE MAN WHO HAD WAITED FOR US ON THE BEACH BEGAN CHATTERING TO THEM EXCITEDLY
716-129582-0026 A FOREIGN LANGUAGE AS I FANCIED AS THEY LAID HANDS ON SOME BALES PILED NEAR THE STERN
716-129582-0027 THE WHITE HAIRED MAN STOOD HOLDING IN A TUMULT OF SIX DOGS AND BAWLING ORDERS OVER THEIR DIN MONTGOMERY HAVING UNSHIPPED THE RUDDER LANDED LIKEWISE AND ALL SET TO WORK AT UNLOADING
716-129582-0028 TO OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE PRESENTLY THE WHITE HAIRED MAN SEEMED TO RECOLLECT MY PRESENCE AND CAME UP TO ME YOU LOOK SAID HE AS THOUGH YOU HAD SCARCELY BREAKFASTED
716-129582-0029 I MUST APOLOGISE FOR THAT NOW YOU ARE OUR GUEST WE MUST MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE THOUGH YOU ARE UNINVITED YOU KNOW HE LOOKED KEENLY INTO MY FACE MONTGOMERY SAYS YOU ARE AN EDUCATED MAN MISTER PRENDICK SAYS YOU KNOW SOMETHING OF SCIENCE
716-129582-0030 MAY I ASK WHAT THAT SIGNIFIES I TOLD HIM I HAD SPENT SOME YEARS AT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SCIENCE AND HAD DONE SOME RESEARCHES IN BIOLOGY UNDER HUXLEY HE RAISED HIS EYEBROWS SLIGHTLY AT THAT
716-129582-0031 THAT ALTERS THE CASE A LITTLE MISTER PRENDICK HE SAID WITH A TRIFLE MORE RESPECT IN HIS MANNER AS IT HAPPENS WE ARE BIOLOGISTS HERE THIS IS A BIOLOGICAL STATION OF A SORT
716-129582-0032 ON ROLLERS TOWARDS THE WALLED YARD I AND MONTGOMERY AT LEAST HE ADDED THEN WHEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET AWAY I CAN'T SAY WE'RE OFF THE TRACK TO ANYWHERE
716-129582-0033 HE LEFT ME ABRUPTLY AND WENT UP THE BEACH PAST THIS GROUP AND I THINK ENTERED THE ENCLOSURE THE OTHER TWO MEN WERE WITH MONTGOMERY ERECTING A PILE OF SMALLER PACKAGES ON A LOW WHEELED TRUCK THE LLAMA WAS STILL ON THE LAUNCH WITH THE RABBIT HUTCHES
716-129582-0034 THE PILE OF THINGS COMPLETED ALL THREE MEN LAID HOLD OF THE TRUCK AND BEGAN SHOVING THE TON WEIGHT OR SO UPON IT AFTER THE PUMA PRESENTLY MONTGOMERY LEFT THEM AND COMING BACK TO ME HELD OUT HIS HAND I'M GLAD SAID HE FOR MY OWN PART
716-129582-0035 THAT CAPTAIN WAS A SILLY ASS HE'D HAVE MADE THINGS LIVELY FOR YOU IT WAS YOU SAID I THAT SAVED ME AGAIN THAT DEPENDS YOU'LL FIND THIS ISLAND AN INFERNALLY RUM PLACE I PROMISE YOU I'D WATCH MY GOINGS CAREFULLY
716-129582-0036 IF I WERE YOU HE HE HESITATED AND SEEMED TO ALTER HIS MIND ABOUT WHAT WAS ON HIS LIPS I WISH YOU'D HELP ME WITH THESE RABBITS HE SAID HIS PROCEDURE WITH THE RABBITS WAS SINGULAR I WADED IN WITH HIM AND HELPED HIM LUG ONE OF THE HUTCHES ASHORE
716-129582-0037 NO SOONER WAS THAT DONE THAN HE OPENED THE DOOR OF IT AND TILTING THE THING ON ONE END TURNED ITS LIVING CONTENTS OUT ON THE GROUND
716-129582-0038 HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS AND FORTHWITH THEY WENT OFF WITH THAT HOPPING RUN OF THEIRS FIFTEEN OR TWENTY OF THEM I SHOULD THINK UP THE BEACH INCREASE AND MULTIPLY MY FRIENDS SAID MONTGOMERY REPLENISH THE ISLAND HITHERTO WE'VE HAD A CERTAIN LACK OF MEAT HERE
716-129582-0039 AS I WATCHED THEM DISAPPEARING THE WHITE HAIRED MAN RETURNED WITH A BRANDY FLASK AND SOME BISCUITS SOMETHING TO GO ON WITH PRENDICK SAID HE IN A FAR MORE FAMILIAR TONE THAN BEFORE I MADE NO ADO BUT SET TO WORK ON THE BISCUITS AT ONCE
716-129582-0040 WHILE THE WHITE HAIRED MAN HELPED MONTGOMERY TO RELEASE ABOUT A SCORE MORE OF THE RABBITS THREE BIG HUTCHES HOWEVER WENT UP TO THE HOUSE WITH THE PUMA
