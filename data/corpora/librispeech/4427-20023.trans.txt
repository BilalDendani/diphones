4427-20023-0000 TO THE NEAR SIGHTED PURBLIND AND SHORT SIGHTED FRIENDS
4427-20023-0001 BUT AS WE ARE ONLY HALF BLIND SUCH COMMENTS AS THESE ARE ALL THE CONSOLATION WE GET OH NEAR SIGHTED IS SHE YES IT IS VERY FASHIONABLE NOW A DAYS FOR YOUNG LADIES TO CARRY EYE GLASSES AND CALL THEMSELVES NEAR SIGHTED OR POOH
4427-20023-0002 I MEET MY FRIEND A SOME MORNING WHO RETURNS MY SALUTATION WITH COLD POLITENESS AND SAYS
4427-20023-0003 BUT AS FOR SEEING YOUR OLD SCHOOLMATE TWO SEATS BEHIND HER OF COURSE YOU ARE TOO NEAR SIGHTED IN VAIN I PROTEST THAT I COULD NOT SEE HER THAT THREE YARDS IS A GREAT DISTANCE TO MY EYES
4427-20023-0004 SEE THAT LITTLE BOY WHO HAVING PUT ON HIS FATHER'S SPECTACLES IS ENJOYING FOR THE FIRST TIME A CLEAR AND DISTINCT VIEW OF THE EVENING SKY OH IS THAT PRETTY LITTLE YELLOW DOT A STAR EXCLAIMS THE DELIGHTED CHILD
4427-20023-0005 BUT WHEN HIS MOTHER ASSURES HIM THAT THE STARS ALWAYS APPEAR SO TO HER AND HE TURNS TO LOOK IN HER FACE HE SAYS WHY MOTHER HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU LOOK PLEASE TO GIVE ME SOME LITTLE SPECTACLES ALL MY OWN
4427-20023-0006 SHE COULD NOT RESIST THIS ENTREATY WHO COULD AND LITTLE SQUIRE SPECS DOES NOT MIND THE SHOUTS OF HIS COMPANIONS OR THE HIGH SOUNDING NICKNAMES THEY GIVE HIM HE SO REJOICES IN WHAT SEEMS TO HIM A NEW SENSE A SECOND SIGHT
4427-20023-0007 I WAS SUMMONED THE OTHER DAY TO WELCOME A FAMILY OF COUSINS FROM A DISTANT STATE WHOM I HAD NOT SEEN FOR A VERY LONG TIME THEY WERE ACCOMPANIED I WAS TOLD BY A BOSTON LADY A STRANGER TO US
4427-20023-0008 I ENTERED THE ROOM WITH CONSIDERABLE EMPRESSEMENT BUT WHEN MY EYE DETECTED THE DIM OUTLINE OF A CIRCLE OF BONNETED FIGURES I STOPPED IN DESPAIR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM NOT KNOWING WHICH WAS WHICH OR WHOM I OUGHT TO SPEAK TO FIRST
4427-20023-0009 AND AT LAST MADE AN EMBARRASSED HALF BOW HALF COURTESY TO THE COMPANY IN GENERAL A CONFUSED MURMUR OF GREETINGS AND INTRODUCTIONS FOLLOWED AND THROWING ASIDE MY AIR OF STIFF CEREMONIOUS POLITENESS
4427-20023-0010 SHOOK HANDS WITH HER IN THE MOST CORDIAL MANNER AND THEN IN PASSING BOWED FORMALLY TO THE NEXT
4427-20023-0011 WHAT THEN WAS MY SURPRISE AND UTTER CONFUSION WHEN SHE CAUGHT ME BY THE HAND AND DRAWING ME TOWARDS HER KISSED ME EMPHATICALLY SEVERAL TIMES HOW DO YOU DO DEAR HAVE YOU QUITE FORGOTTEN ME
4427-20023-0012 WHAT COULD I SAY I WAS PETRIFIED I COULD NOT SMILE I COULD NOT SPEAK MY ONLY FEELING WAS MORTIFICATION AT MY MOST AWKWARD MISTAKE YET I OUGHT TO HAVE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH EMBARRASSMENTS FOR THEY ARE OF VERY FREQUENT OCCURRENCE
4427-20023-0013 WHICH IS TWISTED IN A PUG OR BOB WHICH IS THE CORRECT TERM AND SURMOUNTED BY A TORTOISE SHELL COMB BUT IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF MY NUMEROUS MISTAKES AND BLUNDERS WHETHER LUDICROUS SERIOUS OR EMBARRASSING
4427-20023-0014 I BELIEVE I HAVE NEVER MISTAKEN A COW FOR A HUMAN BEING AS WAS DONE BY OLD DOCTOR E IT WAS MANY YEARS AGO WHEN BOSTON COMMON WAS STILL USED AS A PASTURE AND COWS WERE DAILY TO BE MET IN THE CROOKED STREETS OF THE CITY THAT THIS GENTLEMAN
4427-20023-0015 DISTINGUISHED FOR THE COURTESY AND OLD SCHOOL POLITENESS OF HIS MANNER NO LESS THAN FOR HIS EXTREME NEAR SIGHTEDNESS WAS WALKING AT A BRISK PACE ONE WINTER'S DAY AND SAW JUST BEFORE HIM A LADY AS HE THOUGHT RICHLY DRESSED IN FURS
4427-20023-0016 ANOTHER COW ANECDOTE WHERE AS YOU WILL SEE THERE WAS NO GENTLE POLITENESS WASTED
4427-20023-0017 NUMEROUS ARE THE TRADITIONARY ACCOUNTS OF HIS PECULIARITIES OF HIS ODD MANNERS AND CUSTOMS WHICH I HAVE HEARD BUT IT IS ONLY OF ONE LITTLE INCIDENT THAT I AM NOW GOING TO SPEAK A FAVORITE EMPLOYMENT OF THIS GOOD MAN WAS THE CARE OF HIS GARDEN
4427-20023-0018 AND HE MIGHT BE SEEN ANY PLEASANT AFTERNOON IN SUMMER RIGGED OUT IN A HIDEOUS YELLOW CALICO ROBE OR BLOUSE WITH A DUSTY OLD BLACK STRAW HAT STUCK ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD HOEING AND DIGGING IN THAT BELOVED PATCH OF GROUND
4427-20023-0019 ONE DAY AS HE WAS THUS OCCUPIED HIS WIFE EMERGED FROM THE HOUSE DRESSED IN A DARK BROWN GINGHAM AND BEARING IN HER HAND SOME MUSLINS WHICH SHE BEGAN TO SPREAD UPON THE GOOSEBERRY BUSHES TO WHITEN
4427-20023-0020 SHE WAS VERY BUSILY ENGAGED SO THAT SHE WAS NOT AWARE THAT HER HUSBAND WAS APPROACHING HER WITH A LARGE STICK UNTIL SHE FELT A SMART BLOW ACROSS HER SHOULDERS AND HEARD HIS PECULIAR SHARP VOICE SHOUTING IN HER EARS
