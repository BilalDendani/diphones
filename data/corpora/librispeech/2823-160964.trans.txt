2823-160964-0000 THREE SILLIES ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A FARMER AND HIS WIFE WHO HAD ONE DAUGHTER AND SHE WAS COURTED BY A GENTLEMAN
2823-160964-0001 EVERY EVENING HE USED TO COME AND SEE HER AND STOP TO SUPPER AT THE FARMHOUSE AND THE DAUGHTER USED TO BE SENT DOWN
2823-160964-0002 SO ONE EVENING SHE HAD GONE DOWN TO DRAW THE BEER AND SHE HAPPENED TO LOOK UP
2823-160964-0003 BEAMS IT MUST HAVE BEEN THERE A LONG LONG TIME BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER SHE HAD NEVER NOTICED IT BEFORE AND SHE BEGAN A THINKING AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS TO HAVE THAT MALLET THERE
2823-160964-0004 FOR SHE SAID TO HERSELF SUPPOSE HIM AND ME WAS TO BE MARRIED AND WE WAS TO HAVE A SON AND HE WAS TO GROW UP TO BE A MAN AND COME DOWN INTO THE CELLAR TO DRAW THE BEER LIKE AS I'M DOING NOW
2823-160964-0005 AND THE MALLET WAS TO FALL ON HIS HEAD AND KILL HIM WHAT A DREADFUL THING IT WOULD BE AND SHE PUT DOWN THE CANDLE AND THE JUG AND SAT HERSELF DOWN AND BEGAN A CRYING
2823-160964-0006 WELL THEY BEGAN TO WONDER UPSTAIRS HOW IT WAS THAT SHE WAS SO LONG DRAWING THE BEER AND HER MOTHER WENT DOWN TO SEE AFTER HER AND SHE FOUND HER SITTING ON THE SETTLE CRYING AND THE BEER RUNNING OVER THE FLOOR

2823-160964-0009 AND SHE SAT HER DOWN BESIDE THE DAUGHTER AND STARTED CRYING TOO THEN AFTER A BIT THE FATHER BEGAN TO WONDER THAT THEY DIDN'T COME BACK AND HE WENT DOWN INTO THE CELLAR TO LOOK AFTER THEM HIMSELF AND THERE THEY
2823-160964-0010 WHATEVER IS THE MATTER SAYS HE WHY SAYS THE MOTHER LOOK AT THAT HORRID MALLET JUST SUPPOSE IF OUR DAUGHTER AND HER SWEETHEART WAS TO BE MARRIED AND WAS TO HAVE A SON AND HE WAS TO GROW UP
2823-160964-0011 AND WAS TO COME DOWN INTO THE CELLAR TO DRAW THE BEER AND THE MALLET WAS TO FALL ON HIS HEAD AND KILL HIM WHAT A DREADFUL THING IT WOULD BE DEAR DEAR DEAR SO IT WOULD SAID THE FATHER
2823-160964-0012 NOW THE GENTLEMAN GOT TIRED OF STOPPING UP IN THE KITCHEN BY HIMSELF AND AT LAST HE WENT DOWN INTO THE CELLAR TOO TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE AFTER AND THERE THEY THREE SAT CRYING SIDE BY SIDE
2823-160964-0013 AND THE BEER RUNNING ALL OVER THE FLOOR AND HE RAN STRAIGHT AND TURNED THE TAP THEN HE SAID WHATEVER ARE YOU THREE DOING SITTING THERE CRYING
2823-160964-0014 OH SAYS THE FATHER LOOK AT THAT HORRID MALLET SUPPOSE YOU AND OUR DAUGHTER WAS TO BE MARRIED AND WAS TO HAVE A SON AND HE WAS TO GROW UP AND WAS TO COME DOWN INTO THE CELLAR TO DRAW THE BEER
2823-160964-0015 AND THE MALLET WAS TO FALL ON HIS HEAD AND KILL HIM AND THEN THEY ALL STARTED CRYING WORSE THAN BEFORE BUT THE GENTLEMAN BURST OUT LAUGHING
2823-160964-0016 AND THEN HE SAID I'VE TRAVELED MANY MILES AND I NEVER MET THREE SUCH BIG SILLIES AS YOU THREE BEFORE AND NOW I SHALL START OUT ON MY TRAVELS AGAIN
2823-160964-0017 BIGGER SILLIES THAN YOU THREE THEN I'LL COME BACK AND MARRY YOUR DAUGHTER SO HE WISHED THEM GOOD BY AND STARTED OFF ON HIS TRAVELS AND LEFT THEM ALL CRYING BECAUSE THE GIRL HAD LOST HER SWEETHEART
2823-160964-0018 WELL HE SET OUT AND HE TRAVELED A LONG WAY AND AT LAST HE CAME TO A WOMAN'S COTTAGE THAT HAD SOME GRASS GROWING ON THE ROOF AND THE WOMAN WAS TRYING TO GET HER COW TO GO UP
2823-160964-0019 A LADDER TO THE GRASS AND THE POOR THING DURST NOT GO SO THE GENTLEMAN ASKED THE WOMAN WHAT SHE WAS DOING WHY LOOKYE SHE SAID LOOK AT ALL THAT BEAUTIFUL GRASS
2823-160964-0020 TO EAT IT SHE'LL BE QUITE SAFE FOR I SHALL TIE A STRING ROUND HER NECK
2823-160964-0021 AS I GO ABOUT THE HOUSE SO SHE CAN'T FALL OFF WITHOUT MY KNOWING IT OH YOU POOR SILLY SAID THE GENTLEMAN YOU SHOULD CUT THE GRASS AND THROW IT DOWN TO THE COW BUT THE WOMAN THOUGHT
2823-160964-0022 IT WAS EASIER TO GET THE COW UP THE LADDER THAN TO GET THE GRASS DOWN SO SHE PUSHED HER AND COAXED HER AND GOT HER UP AND TIED A STRING ROUND HER NECK AND PASSED IT DOWN THE CHIMNEY
2823-160964-0023 TUMBLED OFF THE ROOF AND HUNG BY THE STRING TIED ROUND HER NECK AND IT STRANGLED HER AND THE WEIGHT OF THE
2823-160964-0024 WELL THAT WAS ONE BIG SILLY AND THE GENTLEMAN WENT ON AND ON AND HE WENT TO AN INN TO STOP THE NIGHT AND THEY
2823-160964-0025 AND THEY GOT VERY FRIENDLY TOGETHER BUT IN THE MORNING WHEN THEY WERE
2823-160964-0026 THE GENTLEMAN WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THE OTHER HANG HIS TROUSERS ON THE KNOBS OF THE CHEST OF DRAWERS AND RUN ACROSS THE ROOM AND TRY TO JUMP INTO THEM
2823-160964-0027 AND COULDN'T MANAGE IT AND THE GENTLEMAN WONDERED WHATEVER HE WAS DOING IT FOR AT LAST HE STOPPED AND WIPED HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF OH DEAR HE SAYS I DO THINK TROUSERS ARE THE MOST AWKWARDEST
2823-160964-0028 I CAN'T THINK WHO COULD HAVE INVENTED SUCH THINGS IT TAKES ME THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR TO GET INTO MINE EVERY MORNING AND I GET SO HOT HOW DO YOU MANAGE YOURS SO THE GENTLEMAN BURST OUT LAUGHING
2823-160964-0029 AND SHOWED HIM HOW TO PUT THEM ON AND HE WAS VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM
2823-160964-0030 SO THAT WAS ANOTHER BIG SILLY
2823-160964-0031 AND THEY HAD RAKES AND BROOMS AND PITCHFORKS REACHING INTO THE POND AND THE GENTLEMAN ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER WHY THEY SAY MATTER ENOUGH
2823-160964-0032 SO THE GENTLEMAN BURST OUT LAUGHING AND TOLD THEM
2823-160964-0033 BUT THEY WOULDN'T LISTEN TO HIM AND ABUSED HIM SHAMEFULLY AND HE GOT AWAY AS QUICK AS HE COULD SO THERE WERE A WHOLE LOT OF SILLIES BIGGER THAN THE THREE SILLIES AT HOME SO THE GENTLEMAN TURNED BACK HOME AGAIN
