846-130985-0000 OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK THE EFFECTS OF UNION UPON THE COMMERCIAL PROSPERITY OF THE STATES HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY DELINEATED ITS TENDENCY TO PROMOTE THE INTERESTS OF REVENUE WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF OUR PRESENT INQUIRY
846-130985-0001 IS NOW PERCEIVED AND ACKNOWLEDGED BY ALL ENLIGHTENED STATESMEN TO BE THE MOST USEFUL AS WELL AS THE MOST PRODUCTIVE SOURCE OF NATIONAL WEALTH AND HAS ACCORDINGLY BECOME A PRIMARY OBJECT OF THEIR POLITICAL CARES
846-130985-0002 AND INVIGORATE THE CHANNELS OF INDUSTRY AND TO MAKE THEM FLOW WITH GREATER ACTIVITY AND COPIOUSNESS THE ASSIDUOUS MERCHANT THE LABORIOUS HUSBANDMAN THE ACTIVE MECHANIC AND THE INDUSTRIOUS MANUFACTURER
846-130985-0003 THE OFTEN AGITATED QUESTION BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND COMMERCE HAS FROM INDUBITABLE EXPERIENCE RECEIVED A DECISION WHICH HAS SILENCED THE RIVALSHIP THAT ONCE SUBSISTED BETWEEN THEM AND HAS PROVED
846-130985-0004 TO THE SATISFACTION OF THEIR FRIENDS THAT THEIR INTERESTS ARE INTIMATELY BLENDED AND INTERWOVEN IT HAS BEEN FOUND IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES THAT IN PROPORTION AS COMMERCE HAS FLOURISHED LAND HAS RISEN IN VALUE
846-130985-0005 AND HOW COULD IT HAVE HAPPENED OTHERWISE COULD THAT WHICH PROCURES A FREER VENT FOR THE PRODUCTS OF THE EARTH
846-130985-0006 WHICH IS THE MOST POWERFUL INSTRUMENT IN INCREASING THE QUANTITY OF MONEY IN A STATE COULD THAT IN FINE WHICH IS THE FAITHFUL HANDMAID OF LABOR AND INDUSTRY IN EVERY SHAPE FAIL TO AUGMENT THAT ARTICLE
846-130985-0007 THE ABILITY OF A COUNTRY TO PAY TAXES MUST ALWAYS BE PROPORTIONED IN A GREAT DEGREE TO THE QUANTITY OF MONEY IN CIRCULATION AND TO THE CELERITY WITH WHICH IT CIRCULATES
846-130985-0008 COMMERCE CONTRIBUTING TO BOTH THESE OBJECTS MUST OF NECESSITY RENDER THE PAYMENT OF TAXES EASIER AND FACILITATE THE REQUISITE SUPPLIES TO THE TREASURY THE HEREDITARY DOMINIONS OF THE EMPEROR OF GERMANY
846-130985-0009 CONTAIN A GREAT EXTENT OF FERTILE CULTIVATED AND POPULOUS TERRITORY A LARGE PROPORTION OF WHICH IS SITUATED IN MILD AND LUXURIANT CLIMATES IN SOME PARTS OF THIS TERRITORY
846-130985-0010 FROM THE WANT OF THE FOSTERING INFLUENCE OF COMMERCE THAT MONARCH CAN BOAST BUT SLENDER REVENUES HE HAS SEVERAL TIMES BEEN COMPELLED TO OWE OBLIGATIONS TO THE PECUNIARY SUCCORS OF OTHER NATIONS
846-130985-0011 FOR THE PRESERVATION OF HIS ESSENTIAL INTERESTS AND IS UNABLE UPON THE STRENGTH OF HIS OWN RESOURCES TO SUSTAIN A LONG OR CONTINUED WAR BUT IT IS NOT
846-130985-0012 IT IS EVIDENT FROM THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY FROM THE HABITS OF THE PEOPLE FROM THE EXPERIENCE WE HAVE HAD ON THE POINT ITSELF THAT IT IS IMPRACTICABLE TO RAISE ANY VERY CONSIDERABLE SUMS BY DIRECT TAXATION
846-130985-0013 BEEN MULTIPLIED NEW METHODS TO ENFORCE THE COLLECTION HAVE IN VAIN BEEN TRIED THE PUBLIC EXPECTATION HAS BEEN UNIFORMLY DISAPPOINTED AND THE TREASURIES OF THE STATES HAVE REMAINED EMPTY
846-130985-0014 THE POPULAR SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION INHERENT IN THE NATURE OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT COINCIDING WITH THE REAL SCARCITY OF MONEY INCIDENT TO A LANGUID AND MUTILATED STATE OF TRADE
846-130985-0015 HAS HITHERTO DEFEATED EVERY EXPERIMENT FOR EXTENSIVE COLLECTIONS AND HAS AT LENGTH TAUGHT THE DIFFERENT LEGISLATURES THE FOLLY OF ATTEMPTING THEM NO PERSON ACQUAINTED
846-130985-0016 WITH WHAT HAPPENS IN OTHER COUNTRIES WILL BE SURPRISED AT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IN SO OPULENT A NATION AS THAT OF BRITAIN
846-130985-0017 MUCH MORE PRACTICABLE THAN IN AMERICA
846-130985-0018 IS DERIVED FROM TAXES
846-130985-0019 FOR THE MEANS OF REVENUE CHIEFLY ON SUCH DUTIES IN MOST PARTS OF IT EXCISES MUST BE CONFINED WITHIN A NARROW COMPASS THE GENIUS OF THE PEOPLE WILL ILL BROOK THE INQUISITIVE AND PEREMPTORY SPIRIT OF EXCISE LAWS
846-130985-0020 THE POCKETS OF THE FARMERS ON THE OTHER HAND WILL RELUCTANTLY YIELD BUT SCANTY SUPPLIES IN THE UNWELCOME SHAPE
846-130985-0021 AND PERSONAL PROPERTY IS TOO PRECARIOUS AND INVISIBLE A FUND TO BE LAID HOLD OF IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN BY THE IMPERCEPTIBLE AGENCY OF TAXES ON CONSUMPTION IF THESE REMARKS HAVE ANY FOUNDATION
846-130985-0022 THAT STATE OF THINGS WHICH WILL BEST ENABLE US TO IMPROVE AND EXTEND SO VALUABLE A RESOURCE MUST BE BEST ADAPTED TO OUR POLITICAL WELFARE AND IT CANNOT ADMIT OF A SERIOUS DOUBT
846-130985-0023 THAT THIS STATE OF THINGS MUST REST ON THE BASIS OF A GENERAL UNION AS FAR AS THIS WOULD BE CONDUCIVE TO THE INTERESTS OF COMMERCE SO FAR IT MUST TEND TO THE EXTENSION OF THE REVENUE TO BE DRAWN FROM THAT SOURCE
846-130985-0024 AS FAR AS IT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO RENDERING REGULATIONS FOR THE COLLECTION OF THE DUTIES MORE SIMPLE AND EFFICACIOUS SO FAR IT MUST SERVE TO ANSWER THE PURPOSES OF MAKING THE SAME RATE OF DUTIES MORE PRODUCTIVE
846-130985-0025 THE RELATIVE SITUATION OF THESE STATES THE NUMBER OF RIVERS WITH WHICH THEY ARE INTERSECTED AND OF BAYS THAT WASH THERE SHORES THE FACILITY OF COMMUNICATION IN EVERY DIRECTION THE AFFINITY OF LANGUAGE AND MANNERS
846-130985-0026 THE SEPARATE STATES OR CONFEDERACIES WOULD BE NECESSITATED BY MUTUAL JEALOUSY TO AVOID THE TEMPTATIONS TO THAT KIND OF TRADE BY THE LOWNESS OF THEIR DUTIES THE TEMPER OF OUR GOVERNMENTS FOR A LONG TIME TO COME
846-130985-0027 AS WELL BY LAND AS BY WATER AND WHICH EVEN THERE ARE FOUND INSUFFICIENT OBSTACLES TO THE ADVENTUROUS STRATAGEMS OF AVARICE IN FRANCE THERE IS AN ARMY OF PATROLS
846-130985-0028 AS THEY ARE CALLED CONSTANTLY EMPLOYED TO SECURE THEIR FISCAL REGULATIONS AGAINST THE INROADS OF THE DEALERS IN CONTRABAND TRADE MISTER NECKAR COMPUTES THE NUMBER OF THESE PATROLS AT UPWARDS OF TWENTY THOUSAND
846-130985-0029 THIS SHOWS THE IMMENSE DIFFICULTY IN PREVENTING THAT SPECIES OF TRAFFIC WHERE THERE IS AN INLAND COMMUNICATION AND PLACES IN A STRONG LIGHT THE DISADVANTAGES WITH WHICH THE COLLECTION OF DUTIES IN THIS COUNTRY WOULD BE ENCUMBERED
846-130985-0030 IF BY DISUNION THE STATES SHOULD BE PLACED IN A SITUATION WITH RESPECT TO EACH OTHER RESEMBLING THAT OF FRANCE WITH RESPECT TO HER NEIGHBORS THE ARBITRARY AND VEXATIOUS POWERS
846-130985-0031 AS TO THE PRINCIPAL PART OF OUR COMMERCE BUT ONE SIDE TO GUARD THE ATLANTIC COAST VESSELS ARRIVING DIRECTLY FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES LADEN WITH VALUABLE CARGOES
846-130985-0032 WOULD RARELY CHOOSE TO HAZARD THEMSELVES TO THE COMPLICATED AND CRITICAL PERILS WHICH WOULD ATTEND ATTEMPTS TO UNLADE PRIOR TO THEIR COMING INTO PORT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DREAD BOTH THE DANGERS OF THE COAST AND OF DETECTION
846-130985-0033 AS WELL AFTER AS BEFORE THEIR ARRIVAL AT THE PLACES OF THEIR FINAL DESTINATION
846-130985-0034 WOULD BE COMPETENT TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY MATERIAL INFRACTIONS UPON THE RIGHTS OF THE REVENUE A FEW ARMED VESSELS JUDICIOUSLY STATIONED
846-130985-0035 MIGHT AT A SMALL EXPENSE BE MADE USEFUL SENTINELS OF THE LAWS AND THE GOVERNMENT HAVING THE SAME INTEREST TO PROVIDE AGAINST VIOLATIONS EVERYWHERE THE CO OPERATION OF ITS
846-130985-0036 MEASURES IN EACH STATE WOULD HAVE A POWERFUL TENDENCY TO RENDER
846-130985-0037 EFFECTUAL HERE ALSO WE SHOULD PRESERVE BY UNION AN ADVANTAGE WHICH NATURE HOLDS OUT TO US
846-130985-0038 AND AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM ALL OTHER PLACES WITH WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE EXTENSIVE CONNECTIONS OF FOREIGN TRADE THE PASSAGE FROM THEM TO US IN A FEW HOURS OR IN A SINGLE NIGHT
846-130985-0039 AND OF OTHER NEIGHBORING NATIONS WOULD BE IMPRACTICABLE THIS IS A PRODIGIOUS SECURITY AGAINST A DIRECT CONTRABAND WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES BUT A CIRCUITOUS CONTRABAND TO ONE STATE
846-130985-0040 THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF ANOTHER WOULD BE BOTH EASY AND SAFE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DIRECT IMPORTATION FROM ABROAD AND AN INDIRECT IMPORTATION THROUGH THE CHANNEL OF A NEIGHBORING STATE IN SMALL PARCELS
846-130985-0041 ACCORDING TO TIME AND OPPORTUNITY WITH THE ADDITIONAL FACILITIES OF INLAND COMMUNICATION MUST BE PALPABLE TO EVERY MAN OF DISCERNMENT IT IS THEREFORE EVIDENT
846-130985-0042 THAT ONE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WOULD BE ABLE AT MUCH LESS EXPENSE TO EXTEND THE DUTIES ON IMPORTS BEYOND COMPARISON FURTHER THAN WOULD BE PRACTICABLE TO THE STATES SEPARATELY OR TO ANY PARTIAL CONFEDERACIES
846-130985-0043 HITHERTO I BELIEVE IT MAY SAFELY BE ASSERTED THAT THESE DUTIES HAVE NOT UPON AN AVERAGE EXCEEDED IN ANY STATE THREE PER CENT IN FRANCE THEY ARE ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT
846-130985-0044 FIFTEEN PER CENT AND IN BRITAIN THEY EXCEED THIS PROPORTION
846-130985-0045 TREBLE THEIR PRESENT AMOUNT THE SINGLE ARTICLE OF ARDENT SPIRITS UNDER FEDERAL REGULATION MIGHT BE MADE TO FURNISH A CONSIDERABLE REVENUE UPON A RATIO TO THE IMPORTATION INTO THIS STATE
846-130985-0046 WOULD WELL BEAR THIS RATE OF DUTY AND IF IT SHOULD TEND TO DIMINISH THE CONSUMPTION OF IT
846-130985-0047 TO THE MORALS AND TO THE HEALTH OF THE SOCIETY THERE IS PERHAPS NOTHING SO MUCH A SUBJECT OF NATIONAL EXTRAVAGANCE AS THESE SPIRITS
846-130985-0048 REVENUE THEREFORE MUST BE HAD AT ALL EVENTS IN THIS COUNTRY IF THE PRINCIPAL PART BE NOT DRAWN FROM COMMERCE IT MUST FALL WITH OPPRESSIVE WEIGHT UPON LAND
846-130985-0049 IN THEIR TRUE SIGNIFICATION ARE TOO LITTLE IN UNISON WITH THE FEELINGS OF THE PEOPLE TO ADMIT OF GREAT USE BEING MADE OF THAT MODE OF TAXATION NOR INDEED IN THE STATES WHERE ALMOST THE SOLE EMPLOYMENT IS AGRICULTURE
846-130985-0050 WITHOUT MUCH AGGREGATE BENEFIT TO THE STATE
846-130985-0051 ESCAPE THE EYE AND THE HAND OF THE TAX GATHERER AS THE NECESSITIES OF THE STATE NEVERTHELESS MUST BE SATISFIED IN SOME MODE OR OTHER
846-130985-0052 THE DEFECT OF OTHER RESOURCES MUST THROW THE PRINCIPAL WEIGHT OF PUBLIC BURDENS ON THE POSSESSORS OF LAND
846-130985-0053 ON THE OTHER HAND THE WANTS OF THE GOVERNMENT CAN NEVER OBTAIN AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY UNLESS ALL THE SOURCES OF REVENUE ARE OPEN TO ITS DEMANDS THE FINANCES OF THE COMMUNITY UNDER SUCH EMBARRASSMENTS CANNOT BE PUT
846-130985-0054 INTO A SITUATION CONSISTENT WITH ITS RESPECTABILITY OR ITS SECURITY THUS WE SHALL NOT EVEN HAVE THE CONSOLATIONS OF A FULL TREASURY TO ATONE FOR THE OPPRESSION OF THAT VALUABLE CLASS OF THE CITIZENS
846-130985-0055 WHO ARE EMPLOYED IN THE CULTIVATION OF THE SOIL BUT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DISTRESS WILL KEEP PACE WITH EACH OTHER IN GLOOMY CONCERT AND UNITE IN DEPLORING
