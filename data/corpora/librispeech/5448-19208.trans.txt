5448-19208-0000 THE EFFECT OF BEING DEAD HE ALLOWED MARIUS TO SLIDE DOWN UPON THE SHORE
5448-19208-0001 THE MIASMAS DARKNESS HORROR LAY BEHIND HIM THE PURE HEALTHFUL LIVING JOYOUS AIR THAT WAS EASY TO BREATHE INUNDATED HIM EVERYWHERE AROUND HIM REIGNED SILENCE BUT THAT CHARMING SILENCE
5448-19208-0002 TWILIGHT HAD DESCENDED NIGHT WAS DRAWING ON THE GREAT DELIVERER THE FRIEND OF ALL THOSE WHO NEED A MANTLE OF DARKNESS THAT THEY MAY ESCAPE FROM AN ANGUISH THE SKY PRESENTED ITSELF IN ALL DIRECTIONS LIKE AN ENORMOUS CALM
5448-19208-0003 THE RIVER FLOWED TO HIS FEET WITH THE SOUND OF A KISS
5448-19208-0004 A FEW STARS DAINTILY PIERCING THE PALE BLUE OF THE ZENITH AND VISIBLE TO REVERY ALONE FORMED IMPERCEPTIBLE LITTLE SPLENDORS AMID THE IMMENSITY EVENING WAS UNFOLDING OVER THE HEAD OF JEAN VALJEAN ALL THE SWEETNESS OF THE INFINITE
5448-19208-0005 IT WAS THAT EXQUISITE AND UNDECIDED HOUR WHICH SAYS NEITHER YES NOR NO NIGHT WAS ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED TO RENDER IT POSSIBLE TO LOSE ONESELF AT A LITTLE DISTANCE AND YET THERE WAS SUFFICIENT DAYLIGHT TO PERMIT OF RECOGNITION AT CLOSE QUARTERS
5448-19208-0006 FOR SEVERAL SECONDS JEAN VALJEAN WAS IRRESISTIBLY OVERCOME BY THAT AUGUST AND CARESSING SERENITY SUCH MOMENTS OF OBLIVION DO COME TO MEN SUFFERING REFRAINS FROM HARASSING THE UNHAPPY WRETCH EVERYTHING IS ECLIPSED IN THE THOUGHTS
5448-19208-0007 PEACE BROODS OVER THE DREAMER LIKE NIGHT AND BENEATH THE TWILIGHT WHICH BEAMS AND IN IMITATION OF THE SKY WHICH IS ILLUMINATED THE SOUL BECOMES STUDDED WITH STARS
5448-19208-0008 JEAN VALJEAN COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM CONTEMPLATING THAT VAST CLEAR SHADOW WHICH RESTED OVER HIM THOUGHTFULLY HE BATHED IN THE SEA OF ECSTASY AND PRAYER IN THE MAJESTIC SILENCE OF THE ETERNAL HEAVENS THEN HE BENT DOWN SWIFTLY TO MARIUS
5448-19208-0009 AS THOUGH THE SENTIMENT OF DUTY HAD RETURNED TO HIM AND DIPPING UP WATER IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND HE GENTLY SPRINKLED A FEW DROPS ON THE LATTER'S FACE
5448-19208-0010 BUT HIS HALF OPEN MOUTH STILL BREATHED JEAN VALJEAN WAS ON THE POINT OF DIPPING HIS HAND IN THE RIVER ONCE MORE WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE EXPERIENCED AN INDESCRIBABLE EMBARRASSMENT SUCH AS A PERSON FEELS WHEN THERE IS SOME ONE BEHIND HIM
5448-19208-0011 WHOM HE DOES NOT SEE WE HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED TO THIS IMPRESSION WITH WHICH EVERYONE IS FAMILIAR HE TURNED ROUND SOME ONE WAS IN FACT BEHIND HIM AS THERE HAD BEEN A SHORT WHILE BEFORE
5448-19208-0012 A MAN OF LOFTY STATURE ENVELOPED IN A LONG COAT WITH FOLDED ARMS AND BEARING IN HIS RIGHT FIST A BLUDGEON OF WHICH THE LEADEN HEAD WAS VISIBLE STOOD A FEW PACES IN THE REAR OF THE SPOT WHERE JEAN VALJEAN WAS CROUCHING OVER MARIUS
5448-19208-0013 WITH THE AID OF THE DARKNESS IT SEEMED A SORT OF APPARITION AN ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN ALARMED BECAUSE OF THE TWILIGHT A THOUGHTFUL MAN ON ACCOUNT OF THE BLUDGEON JEAN VALJEAN RECOGNIZED JAVERT
5448-19208-0014 HAD BETAKEN HIMSELF TO THE PREFECTURE OF POLICE HAD RENDERED A VERBAL ACCOUNT TO THE PREFECT IN PERSON IN A BRIEF AUDIENCE HAD THEN IMMEDIATELY GONE ON DUTY AGAIN WHICH IMPLIED THE NOTE THE READER WILL RECOLLECT WHICH HAD BEEN CAPTURED ON HIS PERSON
5448-19208-0015 AROUSED THE ATTENTION OF THE POLICE THERE HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THENARDIER AND HAD FOLLOWED HIM THE READER KNOWS THE REST THUS IT WILL BE EASILY UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT GRATING
5448-19208-0016 THE MAN SPIED UPON HAS A SCENT WHICH NEVER DECEIVES HIM IT WAS NECESSARY TO FLING A BONE TO THAT SLEUTH HOUND AN ASSASSIN
5448-19208-0017 SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY MUST NEVER BE ALLOWED TO SLIP THENARDIER BY PUTTING JEAN VALJEAN OUTSIDE IN HIS STEAD PROVIDED A PREY FOR THE POLICE FORCED THEM TO RELINQUISH HIS SCENT MADE THEM FORGET HIM IN A BIGGER ADVENTURE
5448-19208-0018 REPAID JAVERT FOR HIS WAITING WHICH ALWAYS FLATTERS A SPY EARNED THIRTY FRANCS AND COUNTED WITH CERTAINTY SO FAR AS HE HIMSELF WAS CONCERNED ON ESCAPING WITH THE AID OF THIS DIVERSION
5448-19208-0019 THESE TWO ENCOUNTERS THIS FALLING ONE AFTER THE OTHER
5448-19208-0020 NO LONGER LOOKED LIKE HIMSELF HE DID NOT UNFOLD HIS ARMS HE MADE SURE OF HIS BLUDGEON IN HIS FIST BY AN IMPERCEPTIBLE MOVEMENT AND SAID IN A CURT CALM VOICE WHO ARE YOU I WHO
5448-19208-0021 JEAN VALJEAN JAVERT THRUST HIS BLUDGEON BETWEEN HIS TEETH BENT HIS KNEES INCLINED HIS BODY LAID HIS TWO POWERFUL HANDS ON THE SHOULDERS OF JEAN VALJEAN WHICH WERE CLAMPED WITHIN THEM AS IN A COUPLE OF VICES
5448-19208-0022 SCRUTINIZED HIM AND RECOGNIZED HIM THEIR FACES ALMOST TOUCHED JAVERT'S LOOK WAS TERRIBLE JEAN VALJEAN REMAINED INERT BENEATH JAVERT'S GRASP LIKE A LION SUBMITTING TO THE CLAWS OF A LYNX
5448-19208-0023 MOREOVER I HAVE REGARDED MYSELF AS YOUR PRISONER EVER SINCE THIS MORNING I DID NOT GIVE YOU MY ADDRESS WITH ANY INTENTION OF ESCAPING FROM YOU TAKE ME ONLY GRANT ME ONE FAVOR
5448-19208-0024 JAVERT DID NOT APPEAR TO HEAR HIM HE KEPT HIS EYES RIVETED ON JEAN VALJEAN HIS CHIN BEING CONTRACTED THRUST HIS LIPS UPWARDS
5448-19208-0025 A SIGN OF SAVAGE REVERY AT LENGTH HE RELEASED JEAN VALJEAN STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF STIFFLY UP WITHOUT BENDING GRASPED HIS BLUDGEON AGAIN FIRMLY AND AS THOUGH IN A DREAM HE MURMURED RATHER THAN UTTERED THIS QUESTION WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
5448-19208-0026 HE STILL ABSTAINED FROM ADDRESSING JEAN VALJEAN AS THOU JEAN VALJEAN REPLIED AND THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE APPEARED TO ROUSE JAVERT
5448-19208-0027 DISPOSE OF ME AS YOU SEE FIT BUT FIRST HELP ME TO CARRY HIM HOME
5448-19208-0028 JAVERT'S FACE CONTRACTED AS WAS ALWAYS THE CASE WHEN ANY ONE SEEMED TO THINK HIM CAPABLE OF MAKING A CONCESSION NEVERTHELESS HE DID NOT SAY NO AGAIN HE BENT OVER
5448-19208-0029 DREW FROM HIS POCKET A HANDKERCHIEF WHICH HE MOISTENED IN THE WATER
5448-19208-0030 THIS MAN WAS AT THE BARRICADE
5448-19208-0031 A SPY OF THE FIRST QUALITY WHO HAD OBSERVED EVERYTHING LISTENED TO EVERYTHING AND TAKEN IN EVERYTHING EVEN WHEN HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS TO DIE
5448-19208-0032 HE IS WOUNDED SAID JEAN VALJEAN
5448-19208-0033 SAID JAVERT JEAN VALJEAN REPLIED NO NOT YET SO YOU HAVE BROUGHT HIM THITHER FROM THE BARRICADE REMARKED JAVERT
5448-19208-0034 HIS PREOCCUPATION MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN VERY PROFOUND FOR HIM NOT TO INSIST ON THIS ALARMING RESCUE THROUGH THE SEWER AND FOR HIM NOT TO EVEN NOTICE JEAN VALJEAN'S SILENCE AFTER HIS QUESTION JEAN VALJEAN ON HIS SIDE
5448-19208-0035 SEEMED TO HAVE BUT ONE THOUGHT HE RESUMED
5448-19208-0036 I DO NOT RECOLLECT HIS NAME
5448-19208-0037 PULLED OUT HIS POCKET BOOK OPENED IT AT THE PAGE WHICH MARIUS HAD PENCILLED AND HELD IT OUT TO JAVERT THERE WAS STILL SUFFICIENT LIGHT TO ADMIT OF READING BESIDES THIS
5448-19208-0038 JAVERT POSSESSED IN HIS EYE THE FELINE PHOSPHORESCENCE OF NIGHT BIRDS HE DECIPHERED THE FEW LINES WRITTEN BY MARIUS AND MUTTERED GILLENORMAND
5448-19208-0039 THEN HE EXCLAIMED COACHMAN THE READER WILL REMEMBER THAT THE HACKNEY COACH WAS WAITING IN CASE OF NEED
5448-19208-0040 A MOMENT LATER THE CARRIAGE WHICH HAD DESCENDED BY THE INCLINED PLANE OF THE WATERING PLACE WAS ON THE SHORE MARIUS WAS LAID UPON THE BACK SEAT
5448-19208-0041 THE DOOR SLAMMED AND THE CARRIAGE DROVE RAPIDLY AWAY ASCENDING THE QUAYS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BASTILLE THEY QUITTED THE QUAYS AND ENTERED THE STREETS THE COACHMAN A BLACK FORM ON HIS BOX WHIPPED UP HIS THIN HORSES
5448-19208-0042 A GLACIAL SILENCE REIGNED IN THE CARRIAGE MARIUS MOTIONLESS WITH HIS BODY RESTING IN THE CORNER AND HIS HEAD DROOPING ON HIS BREAST HIS ARMS HANGING HIS LEGS STIFF SEEMED TO BE AWAITING ONLY A COFFIN JEAN VALJEAN SEEMED MADE OF SHADOW
5448-19208-0043 AND IN THAT VEHICLE FULL OF NIGHT WHOSE INTERIOR EVERY TIME THAT IT PASSED IN FRONT OF A STREET LANTERN APPEARED TO BE TURNED LIVIDLY WAN AS BY AN INTERMITTENT FLASH OF LIGHTNING
5448-19208-0044 CHANCE HAD UNITED AND SEEMED TO BE BRINGING FACE TO FACE THE THREE FORMS OF TRAGIC IMMOBILITY THE CORPSE THE SPECTRE
5448-19208-0045 RETURN OF THE SON WHO WAS PRODIGAL OF HIS LIFE
5448-19208-0046 JAVERT WAS THE FIRST TO ALIGHT HE MADE SURE WITH ONE GLANCE OF THE NUMBER ON THE CARRIAGE GATE AND RAISING THE HEAVY KNOCKER OF BEATEN IRON EMBELLISHED IN THE OLD STYLE WITH A MALE GOAT AND A SATYR CONFRONTING EACH OTHER
5448-19208-0047 HE GAVE A VIOLENT PEAL THE GATE OPENED A LITTLE WAY AND JAVERT GAVE IT A PUSH THE PORTER HALF MADE HIS APPEARANCE YAWNING VAGUELY AWAKE AND WITH A CANDLE IN HIS HAND EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE WAS ASLEEP
5448-19208-0048 PEOPLE GO TO BED BETIMES IN THE MARAIS
5448-19208-0049 THIS GOOD OLD QUARTER TERRIFIED AT THE REVOLUTION TAKES REFUGE IN SLUMBER AS CHILDREN WHEN THEY HEAR THE BUGABOO COMING HIDE THEIR HEADS HASTILY UNDER THEIR COVERLET IN THE MEANTIME JEAN VALJEAN AND THE COACHMAN
5448-19208-0050 HAD TAKEN MARIUS OUT OF THE CARRIAGE JEAN VALJEAN SUPPORTING HIM UNDER THE ARMPITS AND THE COACHMAN UNDER THE KNEES
5448-19208-0051 JEAN VALJEAN SLIPPED HIS HAND UNDER THE LATTER'S CLOTHES WHICH WERE BROADLY RENT FELT HIS BREAST AND ASSURED HIMSELF THAT HIS HEART WAS STILL BEATING IT WAS EVEN BEATING A LITTLE LESS FEEBLY AS THOUGH THE MOVEMENT OF THE CARRIAGE HAD BROUGHT ABOUT A CERTAIN FRESH ACCESS OF LIFE
5448-19208-0052 IN A TONE BEFITTING THE GOVERNMENT
5448-19208-0053 THE PORTER DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND EITHER JAVERT'S WORDS OR JEAN VALJEAN'S SIGN JAVERT CONTINUED
5448-19208-0054 TO THE BARRICADE EJACULATED THE PORTER
5448-19208-0055 THE PORTER DID NOT STIR
5448-19208-0056 REPEATED JAVERT AND HE ADDED THERE WILL BE A FUNERAL HERE TO MORROW
5448-19208-0057 THE USUAL INCIDENTS OF THE PUBLIC HIGHWAY WERE CATEGORICALLY CLASSED WHICH IS THE BEGINNING OF FORESIGHT AND SURVEILLANCE AND EACH CONTINGENCY HAD ITS OWN COMPARTMENT ALL POSSIBLE FACTS WERE ARRANGED IN DRAWERS AS IT WERE
5448-19208-0058 WHENCE THEY EMERGED ON OCCASION IN VARIABLE QUANTITIES IN THE STREET UPROAR REVOLT CARNIVAL
5448-19208-0059 BASQUE WOKE NICOLETTE NICOLETTE
5448-19208-0060 AS FOR THE GRANDFATHER THEY LET HIM SLEEP ON THINKING THAT HE WOULD HEAR ABOUT THE MATTER EARLY ENOUGH IN ANY CASE MARIUS WAS CARRIED UP TO THE FIRST FLOOR WITHOUT ANY ONE IN THE OTHER PARTS OF THE HOUSE BEING AWARE OF THE FACT
5448-19208-0061 AND DEPOSITED ON AN OLD SOFA
5448-19208-0062 AND WHILE BASQUE WENT IN SEARCH OF A PHYSICIAN AND WHILE NICOLETTE OPENED THE LINEN PRESSES JEAN VALJEAN FELT JAVERT TOUCH HIM ON THE SHOULDER HE UNDERSTOOD AND DESCENDED THE STAIRS
5448-19208-0063 HAVING BEHIND HIM THE STEP OF JAVERT WHO WAS FOLLOWING HIM THE PORTER WATCHED THEM TAKE THEIR DEPARTURE AS HE HAD WATCHED THEIR ARRIVAL IN TERRIFIED SOMNOLENCE THEY ENTERED THE CARRIAGE ONCE MORE AND THE COACHMAN MOUNTED HIS BOX
5448-19208-0064 INSPECTOR JAVERT SAID JEAN GRANT ME YET ANOTHER FAVOR WHAT IS IT DEMANDED JAVERT ROUGHLY LET ME GO HOME FOR ONE INSTANT THEN YOU SHALL DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE WITH ME
5448-19208-0065 JAVERT REMAINED SILENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS WITH HIS CHIN DRAWN BACK INTO THE COLLAR OF HIS GREAT COAT THEN HE LOWERED THE GLASS AND FRONT DRIVER SAID HE
5448-19208-0066 THEY DID NOT OPEN THEIR LIPS AGAIN DURING THE WHOLE SPACE OF THEIR RIDE WHAT DID JEAN VALJEAN WANT TO FINISH WHAT HE HAD BEGUN TO WARN COSETTE TO TELL HER WHERE MARIUS WAS
5448-19208-0067 TO GIVE HER POSSIBLY SOME OTHER USEFUL INFORMATION TO TAKE IF HE COULD CERTAIN FINAL MEASURES AS FOR HIMSELF SO FAR AS HE WAS PERSONALLY CONCERNED ALL WAS OVER
5448-19208-0068 AND HAD NOT RESISTED ANY OTHER MAN THAN HIMSELF IN LIKE SITUATION WOULD PERHAPS HAVE HAD SOME VAGUE THOUGHTS CONNECTED WITH THE ROPE WHICH THENARDIER HAD GIVEN HIM AND OF THE BARS OF THE FIRST CELL THAT HE SHOULD ENTER BUT
5448-19208-0069 LET US IMPRESS IT UPON THE READER AFTER THE BISHOP
5448-19208-0070 A PROFOUND HESITATION IN THE PRESENCE OF ANY VIOLENCE EVEN WHEN DIRECTED AGAINST HIMSELF SUICIDE THAT MYSTERIOUS ACT OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THE UNKNOWN WHICH MAY CONTAIN IN A MEASURE THE DEATH OF THE SOUL
5448-19208-0071 WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO JEAN VALJEAN
5448-19208-0072 THE CARRIAGE HALTED THE WAY BEING TOO NARROW TO ADMIT OF THE ENTRANCE OF VEHICLES JAVERT AND JEAN VALJEAN ALIGHTED THE COACHMAN HUMBLY REPRESENTED TO MONSIEUR L'INSPECTEUR
5448-19208-0073 THAT THE UTRECHT VELVET OF HIS CARRIAGE WAS ALL SPOTTED WITH THE BLOOD OF THE ASSASSINATED MAN AND WITH MIRE FROM THE ASSASSIN THAT IS THE WAY HE UNDERSTOOD IT HE ADDED THAT AN INDEMNITY WAS DUE HIM
5448-19208-0074 AT THE SAME TIME DRAWING HIS CERTIFICATE BOOK FROM HIS POCKET HE BEGGED THE INSPECTOR TO HAVE THE GOODNESS TO WRITE HIM A BIT OF AN ATTESTATION JAVERT THRUST ASIDE THE BOOK WHICH THE COACHMAN HELD OUT TO HIM AND SAID HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT

5448-19208-0078 JEAN VALJEAN KNOCKED THE DOOR OPENED
5448-19208-0079 GO UP STAIRS HE ADDED WITH A STRANGE EXPRESSION AND AS THOUGH HE WERE EXERTING AN EFFORT IN SPEAKING IN THIS MANNER
5448-19208-0080 JEAN VALJEAN LOOKED AT JAVERT THIS MODE OF PROCEDURE WAS BUT LITTLE IN ACCORD WITH JAVERT'S HABITS HOWEVER HE COULD NOT BE GREATLY SURPRISED THAT JAVERT SHOULD NOW HAVE A SORT OF HAUGHTY CONFIDENCE IN HIM
5448-19208-0081 THE CONFIDENCE OF THE CAT WHICH GRANTS THE MOUSE LIBERTY TO THE LENGTH OF ITS CLAWS SEEING THAT JEAN VALJEAN HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO SURRENDER HIMSELF AND TO MAKE AN END OF IT HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR ENTERED THE HOUSE
5448-19208-0082 CALLED TO THE PORTER WHO WAS IN BED AND WHO HAD PULLED THE CORD FROM HIS COUCH IT IS I AND ASCENDED THE STAIRS ON ARRIVING AT THE FIRST FLOOR HE PAUSED ALL SORROWFUL ROADS HAVE THEIR STATIONS
5448-19208-0083 THE WINDOW ON THE LANDING PLACE WHICH WAS A SASH WINDOW WAS OPEN AS IN MANY ANCIENT HOUSES THE STAIRCASE GOT ITS LIGHT FROM WITHOUT AND HAD A VIEW ON THE STREET THE STREET LANTERN SITUATED DIRECTLY OPPOSITE
5448-19208-0084 CAST SOME LIGHT ON THE STAIRS AND THUS EFFECTED SOME ECONOMY IN ILLUMINATION JEAN VALJEAN EITHER FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING THE AIR OR MECHANICALLY THRUST HIS HEAD OUT OF THIS WINDOW HE LEANED OUT OVER THE STREET
5448-19208-0085 IT IS SHORT AND THE LANTERN LIGHTED IT FROM END TO END JEAN VALJEAN WAS OVERWHELMED WITH AMAZEMENT
