2487-169018-0000 THAT IT WAS FAR BETTER TO BE MARRIED TO ANYBODY THAN DO THAT
2487-169018-0001 UPON EITHER SILL OF WHICH SHE COULD SIT BY FIRST MOUNTING A DESK AND USING IT AS A FOOTSTOOL
2487-169018-0002 HERE SHE PERCHED HERSELF AS WAS HER CUSTOM ON SUCH WET AND GLOOMY OCCASIONS PUT ON A LIGHT SHAWL AND BONNET OPENED THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT AT THE RAIN THE WINDOW OVERLOOKED A FIELD CALLED THE GROVE
2487-169018-0003 AND IT WAS THE POSITION FROM WHICH SHE USED TO SURVEY THE CROWN OF DICK'S PASSING HAT IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE AND MEETINGS NOT A LIVING SOUL WAS NOW VISIBLE ANYWHERE
2487-169018-0004 AND NECESSITY WAS LESS IMPORTUNATE ON SUNDAYS THAN DURING THE WEEK SITTING HERE AND THINKING AGAIN
2487-169018-0005 WELL IT IS UNKNOWN THINKING AND THINKING SHE SAW A DARK MASCULINE FIGURE ARISING INTO DISTINCTNESS AT THE FURTHER END OF THE GROVE A MAN WITHOUT AN UMBRELLA
2487-169018-0006 NEARER AND NEARER HE CAME AND SHE PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS IN DEEP MOURNING AND THEN THAT IT WAS DICK YES IN THE FONDNESS AND FOOLISHNESS OF HIS YOUNG HEART AFTER WALKING FOUR MILES IN A DRIZZLING RAIN WITHOUT OVERCOAT OR UMBRELLA
2487-169018-0007 AND IN FACE OF A REMARK FROM HIS LOVE THAT HE WAS NOT TO COME BECAUSE HE WOULD BE TIRED HE HAD MADE IT HIS BUSINESS TO WANDER THIS MILE OUT OF HIS WAY AGAIN
2487-169018-0008 YOUR COAT SHINES AS IF IT HAD BEEN VARNISHED AND YOUR HAT MY GOODNESS THERE'S A STREAMING HAT
2487-169018-0009 I AM RATHER SORRY FOR MY BEST CLOTHES
2487-169018-0010 I DON'T KNOW WHEN I SHALL GET MINE BACK AND LOOK THERE'S A NASTY PATCH OF SOMETHING JUST ON YOUR SHOULDER
2487-169018-0011 THAT'S JAPANNING IT RUBBED OFF THE CLAMPS OF POOR JACK'S COFFIN WHEN WE LOWERED HIM FROM OUR SHOULDERS UPON THE BIER I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT FOR TWAS THE LAST DEED I COULD DO FOR HIM AND TIS HARD IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD A COAT FOR AN OLD FRIEND
2487-169018-0012 FANCY PUT HER HAND TO HER MOUTH FOR HALF A MINUTE UNDERNEATH THE PALM OF THAT LITTLE HAND THERE EXISTED FOR THAT HALF MINUTE A LITTLE YAWN DICK
2487-169018-0013 HE PLEADED IF I CAN REACH THEN HE LOOKED RATHER DISAPPOINTED AT NOT BEING INVITED ROUND TO THE DOOR SHE TWISTED FROM HER SEATED POSITION AND BENT HERSELF DOWNWARDS
2487-169018-0014 BUT NOT EVEN BY STANDING ON THE PLINTH WAS IT POSSIBLE FOR DICK TO GET HIS LIPS INTO CONTACT WITH HERS AS SHE HELD THEM BY GREAT EXERTION SHE MIGHT HAVE REACHED A LITTLE LOWER BUT
2487-169018-0015 HE WALKED SLOWLY AWAY TURNING AND TURNING AGAIN TO LOOK AT HER TILL HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT DURING THE RETREAT SHE SAID TO HERSELF ALMOST INVOLUNTARILY AND STILL CONSCIOUS OF THAT MORNING'S TRIUMPH
2487-169018-0016 I LIKE DICK AND I LOVE HIM BUT HOW PLAIN AND SORRY A MAN LOOKS IN THE RAIN WITH NO UMBRELLA AND WET THROUGH AS HE VANISHED SHE MADE AS IF TO DESCEND FROM HER SEAT
2487-169018-0017 BUT GLANCING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION SHE SAW ANOTHER FORM COMING ALONG THE SAME TRACK IT WAS ALSO THAT OF A MAN HE TOO WAS IN BLACK FROM TOP TO TOE BUT HE CARRIED AN UMBRELLA
2487-169018-0018 HE DREW NEARER AND THE DIRECTION OF THE RAIN CAUSED HIM SO TO SLANT HIS UMBRELLA THAT FROM HER HEIGHT ABOVE THE GROUND HIS HEAD WAS INVISIBLE AS SHE WAS ALSO TO HIM HE PASSED IN DUE TIME DIRECTLY BENEATH HER
2487-169018-0019 AND IN LOOKING DOWN UPON THE EXTERIOR OF HIS UMBRELLA HER FEMININE EYES PERCEIVED IT TO BE OF SUPERIOR SILK LESS COMMON AT THAT DATE THAN SINCE AND OF ELEGANT MAKE
2487-169018-0020 HE REACHED THE ENTRANCE TO THE BUILDING AND FANCY SUDDENLY LOST SIGHT OF HIM INSTEAD OF PURSUING THE ROADWAY AS DICK HAD DONE HE HAD TURNED SHARPLY ROUND INTO HER OWN PORCH SHE JUMPED TO THE FLOOR
2487-169018-0021 HASTILY FLUNG OFF HER SHAWL AND BONNET SMOOTHED AND PATTED HER HAIR TILL THE CURLS HUNG IN PASSABLE CONDITION AND LISTENED NO KNOCK NEARLY A MINUTE PASSED AND STILL THERE WAS NO KNOCK
2487-169018-0022 THEN THERE AROSE A SOFT SERIES OF RAPS NO LOUDER THAN THE TAPPING OF A DISTANT WOODPECKER AND BARELY DISTINCT ENOUGH TO REACH HER EARS SHE COMPOSED HERSELF AND FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR
2487-169018-0023 IN THE PORCH STOOD MISTER MAYBOLD THERE WAS A WARM FLUSH UPON HIS FACE AND A BRIGHT FLASH IN HIS EYES WHICH MADE HIM LOOK HANDSOMER THAN SHE HAD EVER SEEN HIM BEFORE GOOD EVENING MISS DAY
2487-169018-0024 SHE SAID IN A STRANGE STATE OF MIND SHE HAD NOTICED BEYOND THE ARDENT HUE OF HIS FACE THAT HIS VOICE HAD A SINGULAR TREMOR IN IT AND THAT HIS HAND SHOOK LIKE AN ASPEN LEAF WHEN HE LAID HIS UMBRELLA IN THE CORNER OF THE PORCH
2487-169018-0025 SHUT THE DOOR AND MOVED CLOSE TO HER ONCE INSIDE THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE WAS NO MORE DISCERNIBLE BY REASON OF THE INCREASING DUSK OF EVENING I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU HE THEN SAID SERIOUSLY

2487-169018-0027 ROLLING A SNOWBALL MIGHT START AT FINDING HE HAD SET IN MOTION AN AVALANCHE SO DID FANCY START AT THESE WORDS FROM THE VICAR AND IN THE DEAD SILENCE WHICH FOLLOWED THEM THE BREATHINGS OF THE MAN AND OF THE WOMAN

2487-169018-0041 THE NEXT MINUTE SHE TURNED TO A DESK
2487-169018-0042 IT WAS WITH VISIBLE DIFFICULTY THAT HE RESTRAINED HIMSELF FROM APPROACHING HER
