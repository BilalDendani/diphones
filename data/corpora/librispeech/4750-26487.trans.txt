4750-26487-0000 NO VERY LONG TIME AFTERWARD AND HAVING GOTTEN TOGETHER A GREAT ARMY THEY MADE WAR AGAINST THE ISRAELITES AND HAVING SEIZED A PLACE BETWEEN SHOCHOH AND AZEKAH THEY THERE PITCHED THEIR CAMP SAUL ALSO DREW OUT HIS ARMY TO OPPOSE THEM
4750-26487-0001 NOW THERE CAME DOWN A MAN OUT OF THE CAMP OF THE PHILISTINES WHOSE NAME WAS GOLIATH OF THE CITY OF GATH A MAN OF VAST BULK FOR HE WAS OF FOUR CUBITS AND A SPAN IN TALLNESS
4750-26487-0002 AND HAD ABOUT HIM WEAPONS SUITABLE TO THE LARGENESS OF HIS BODY FOR HE HAD A BREASTPLATE ON THAT WEIGHED FIVE THOUSAND SHEKELS HE HAD ALSO A HELMET AND GREAVES OF BRASS AS LARGE AS YOU WOULD NATURALLY SUPPOSE MIGHT COVER THE LIMBS OF SO VAST A BODY
4750-26487-0003 HIS SPEAR WAS ALSO SUCH AS WAS NOT CARRIED LIKE A LIGHT THING IN HIS RIGHT HAND BUT HE CARRIED IT AS LYING ON HIS SHOULDERS HE HAD ALSO A LANCE OF SIX HUNDRED SHEKELS AND MANY FOLLOWED HIM TO CARRY HIS ARMOR
4750-26487-0004 WHEREFORE THIS GOLIATH STOOD BETWEEN THE TWO ARMIES AS THEY WERE IN BATTLE ARRAY AND SENT OUT ALOUD VOICE AND SAID TO SAUL AND THE HEBREWS I WILL FREE YOU FROM FIGHTING AND FROM DANGERS FOR WHAT NECESSITY IS THERE
4750-26487-0005 THAT YOUR ARMY SHOULD FALL AND BE AFFLICTED GIVE ME A MAN OF YOU THAT WILL FIGHT WITH ME AND HE THAT CONQUERS SHALL HAVE THE REWARD OF THE CONQUEROR AND DETERMINE THE WAR FOR THESE SHALL SERVE THOSE OTHERS TO WHOM THE CONQUEROR SHALL BELONG
4750-26487-0006 AND DID NOT LEAVE OFF FOR FORTY DAYS TOGETHER TO CHALLENGE THE ENEMY IN THE SAME WORDS TILL SAUL AND HIS ARMY WERE THEREWITH TERRIFIED WHILE THEY PUT THEMSELVES IN ARRAY AS IF THEY WOULD FIGHT
4750-26487-0007 AND TO BE PARTNERS IN THE DANGERS OF THE WAR AND AT FIRST DAVID RETURNED TO FEED HIS SHEEP AND HIS FLOCKS BUT AFTER NO LONG TIME HE CAME TO THE CAMP OF THE HEBREWS AS SENT BY HIS FATHER TO CARRY PROVISIONS TO HIS BRETHREN AND TO KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING
4750-26487-0008 HE HEARD THE PHILISTINE REPROACHING AND ABUSING THE ARMY AND HAD INDIGNATION AT IT AND SAID TO HIS BRETHREN I AM READY TO FIGHT A SINGLE COMBAT WITH THIS ADVERSARY WHEREUPON ELIAB HIS ELDEST BROTHER REPROVED HIM
4750-26487-0009 AND SAID THAT HE SPOKE TOO RASHLY AND IMPROPERLY FOR ONE OF HIS AGE AND BID HIM GO TO HIS FLOCKS AND TO HIS FATHER SO HE WAS ABASHED AT HIS BROTHER'S WORDS AND WENT AWAY BUT STILL HE SPAKE TO SOME OF THE SOLDIERS THAT HE WAS WILLING TO FIGHT WITH HIM THAT CHALLENGED THEM
4750-26487-0010 AND WHEN THEY HAD INFORMED SAUL WHAT WAS THE RESOLUTION OF THE YOUNG MAN THE KING SENT FOR HIM TO COME TO HIM AND WHEN THE KING ASKED WHAT HE HAD TO SAY HE REPLIED O KING BE NOT CAST DOWN NOR AFRAID FOR I WILL DEPRESS THE INSOLENCE OF THIS ADVERSARY
4750-26487-0011 AS TALL AND AS GREAT AS HE IS TILL HE SHALL BE SUFFICIENTLY LAUGHED AT
4750-26487-0012 BUT DURST NOT PRESUME ON HIS ABILITY BY REASON OF HIS AGE BUT SAID HE MUST ON THAT ACCOUNT BE TOO WEAK TO FIGHT WITH ONE THAT WAS SKILLED IN THE ART OF WAR I UNDERTAKE THIS ENTERPRISE SAID DAVID IN DEPENDENCE ON GOD'S BEING WITH ME
4750-26487-0013 FOR I HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE ALREADY OF HIS ASSISTANCE FOR I ONCE PURSUED AFTER AND CAUGHT A LION THAT ASSAULTED MY FLOCKS AND TOOK AWAY A LAMB FROM THEM AND I SNATCHED THE LAMB OUT OF THE WILD BEAST'S MOUTH AND WHEN HE LEAPED UPON ME WITH VIOLENCE
4750-26487-0014 AND LET THIS ADVERSARY OF OURS BE ESTEEMED LIKE ONE OF THESE WILD BEASTS SINCE HE HAS A LONG WHILE REPROACHED OUR ARMY AND BLASPHEMED OUR GOD
4750-26487-0015 SAUL PRAYED THAT THE END MIGHT BE BY GOD'S ASSISTANCE NOT DISAGREEABLE TO THE ALACRITY AND BOLDNESS OF THE CHILD AND SAID GO THY WAY TO THE FIGHT SO HE PUT ABOUT HIM HIS BREASTPLATE AND GIRDED ON HIS SWORD AND FITTED THE HELMET TO HIS HEAD
4750-26487-0016 AND AS I MYSELF DESIRE ACCORDINGLY HE LAID BY THE ARMOR AND TAKING HIS STAFF WITH HIM AND PUTTING FIVE STONES OUT OF THE BROOK INTO A SHEPHERD'S BAG AND HAVING A SLING IN HIS RIGHT HAND HE WENT TOWARDS GOLIATH
4750-26487-0017 BUT THE ADVERSARY SEEING HIM COME IN SUCH A MANNER DISDAINED HIM AND JESTED UPON HIM AS IF HE HAD NOT SUCH WEAPONS WITH HIM AS ARE USUAL WHEN ONE MAN FIGHTS AGAINST ANOTHER BUT SUCH AS ARE USED IN DRIVING AWAY AND AVOIDING OF DOGS
4750-26487-0018 BUT I HAVE GOD FOR MY ARMOR IN COMING AGAINST THEE WHO WILL DESTROY THEE AND ALL THY ARMY BY MY HANDS FOR I WILL THIS DAY CUT OFF THY HEAD AND CAST THE OTHER PARTS OF THY BODY TO THE DOGS
4750-26487-0019 AND ALL MEN SHALL LEARN THAT GOD IS THE PROTECTOR OF THE HEBREWS AND THAT OUR ARMOR AND OUR STRENGTH IS IN HIS PROVIDENCE AND THAT WITHOUT GOD'S ASSISTANCE ALL OTHER WARLIKE PREPARATIONS AND POWER ARE USELESS
4750-26487-0020 SO THE PHILISTINE BEING RETARDED BY THE WEIGHT OF HIS ARMOR WHEN HE ATTEMPTED TO MEET DAVID IN HASTE CAME ON BUT SLOWLY AS DESPISING HIM AND DEPENDING UPON IT THAT HE SHOULD SLAY HIM
4750-26487-0021 FOR HE HAD NO SWORD HIMSELF AND UPON THE FALL OF GOLIATH THE PHILISTINES WERE BEATEN AND FLED FOR WHEN THEY SAW THEIR CHAMPION PROSTRATE ON THE GROUND THEY WERE AFRAID OF THE ENTIRE ISSUE OF THEIR AFFAIRS AND RESOLVED NOT TO STAY ANY LONGER
4750-26487-0022 BUT COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO AN IGNOMINIOUS AND INDECENT FLIGHT AND THEREBY ENDEAVORED TO SAVE THEMSELVES FROM THE DANGERS THEY WERE IN BUT SAUL AND THE ENTIRE ARMY OF THE HEBREWS MADE A SHOUT AND RUSHED UPON THEM AND SLEW A GREAT NUMBER OF THEM
4750-26487-0023 BUT DEDICATED HIS SWORD TO GOD AT THE TABERNACLE CHAPTER TEN SAUL ENVIES DAVID FOR HIS GLORIOUS SUCCESS AND TAKES AN OCCASION OF ENTRAPPING HIM FROM THE PROMISE HE MADE HIM
4750-26487-0024 OF GIVING HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE BUT THIS UPON CONDITION
4750-26487-0025 FOR THEY CAME TO MEET THEIR VICTORIOUS ARMY WITH CYMBALS AND DRUMS AND ALL DEMONSTRATIONS OF JOY AND SANG THUS THE WIVES SAID THAT SAUL HAD SLAIN HIS MANY THOUSANDS OF THE PHILISTINES THE VIRGINS REPLIED
4750-26487-0026 THAT DAVID HAD SLAIN HIS TEN THOUSANDS NOW WHEN THE KING HEARD THEM SINGING THUS AND THAT HE HAD HIMSELF THE SMALLEST SHARE IN THEIR COMMENDATIONS AND THE GREATER NUMBER THE TEN THOUSANDS
4750-26487-0027 AND WHEN HE CONSIDERED WITH HIMSELF THAT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE WANTING TO DAVID AFTER SUCH A MIGHTY APPLAUSE BUT THE KINGDOM HE BEGAN TO BE AFRAID AND SUSPICIOUS OF DAVID ACCORDINGLY HE REMOVED HIM FROM THE STATION HE WAS IN BEFORE
4750-26487-0028 FOR HE WAS HIS ARMOR BEARER WHICH OUT OF FEAR SEEMED TO HIM MUCH TOO NEAR A STATION FOR HIM AND SO HE MADE HIM
4750-26487-0029 AND ACCORDINGLY HE GREATLY PROSPERED IN HIS UNDERTAKINGS AND IT WAS VISIBLE THAT HE HAD MIGHTY SUCCESS
4750-26487-0030 AS INTENDING TO MAKE USE OF IT FOR A SNARE AGAINST DAVID AND HE HOPED THAT IT WOULD PROVE THE CAUSE OF DESTRUCTION AND OF HAZARD TO HIM SO HE TOLD THOSE THAT INFORMED HIM OF HIS DAUGHTER'S AFFECTION THAT HE WOULD WILLINGLY GIVE DAVID THE VIRGIN IN MARRIAGE
4750-26487-0031 AND SAID I ENGAGE MYSELF TO MARRY MY DAUGHTER TO HIM IF HE WILL BRING ME SIX HUNDRED HEADS
4750-26487-0032 AND WHEN HE SHOULD AIM TO GET HIM GREAT GLORY BY UNDERTAKING A THING SO DANGEROUS AND INCREDIBLE HE WOULD IMMEDIATELY SET ABOUT IT AND SO PERISH BY THE PHILISTINES AND MY DESIGNS ABOUT HIM WILL SUCCEED FINELY TO MY MIND
4750-26487-0033 FOR I SHALL BE FREED FROM HIM AND GET HIM SLAIN NOT BY MYSELF BUT BY ANOTHER MAN SO HE GAVE ORDER TO HIS SERVANTS TO TRY HOW DAVID WOULD RELISH THIS PROPOSAL OF MARRYING THE DAMSEL
4750-26487-0034 ACCORDINGLY THEY BEGAN TO SPEAK THUS TO HIM THAT KING SAUL LOVED HIM AS WELL AS DID ALL THE PEOPLE AND THAT HE WAS DESIROUS OF HIS AFFINITY BY THE MARRIAGE OF THIS DAMSEL TO WHICH HE GAVE THIS ANSWER
4750-26487-0035 SEEMETH IT TO YOU A LIGHT THING TO BE MADE THE KING'S SON IN LAW IT DOES NOT SEEM SO TO ME ESPECIALLY WHEN I AM ONE OF A FAMILY THAT IS LOW AND WITHOUT ANY GLORY OR HONOR
4750-26487-0036 NOW WHEN SAUL WAS INFORMED BY HIS SERVANTS WHAT ANSWER DAVID HAD MADE HE SAID TELL HIM THAT I DO NOT WANT ANY MONEY NOR DOWRY FROM HIM WHICH WOULD BE RATHER TO SET MY DAUGHTER TO SALE THAN TO GIVE HER IN MARRIAGE
4750-26487-0037 BUT I DESIRE ONLY SUCH A SON IN LAW AS HATH IN HIM FORTITUDE AND ALL OTHER KINDS OF VIRTUE OF WHICH HE SAW DAVID WAS POSSESSED AND THAT HIS DESIRE WAS TO RECEIVE OF HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS MARRYING HIS DAUGHTER
4750-26487-0038 NEITHER GOLD NOR SILVER NOR THAT HE SHOULD BRING SUCH WEALTH OUT OF HIS FATHER'S HOUSE BUT ONLY SOME REVENGE ON THE PHILISTINES AND INDEED SIX HUNDRED OF THEIR HEADS THAN WHICH A MORE DESIRABLE OR A MORE GLORIOUS PRESENT
4750-26487-0039 COULD NOT BE BROUGHT HIM AND THAT HE HAD MUCH RATHER OBTAIN THIS THAN ANY OF THE ACCUSTOMED DOWRIES FOR HIS DAUGHTER VIZ THAT SHE SHOULD BE MARRIED TO A MAN OF THAT CHARACTER AND TO ONE WHO HAD A TESTIMONY
4750-26487-0040 HE WAS PLEASED WITH THEM AND SUPPOSED THAT SAUL WAS REALLY DESIROUS OF THIS AFFINITY WITH HIM SO THAT WITHOUT BEARING TO DELIBERATE ANY LONGER OR CASTING ABOUT IN HIS MIND WHETHER WHAT WAS PROPOSED WAS POSSIBLE
4750-26487-0041 OR WAS DIFFICULT OR NOT HE AND HIS COMPANIONS IMMEDIATELY SET UPON THE ENEMY AND WENT ABOUT DOING WHAT WAS PROPOSED AS THE CONDITION OF THE MARRIAGE ACCORDINGLY BECAUSE IT WAS GOD WHO MADE ALL THINGS EASY AND POSSIBLE TO DAVID
4750-26487-0042 HE SLEW MANY OF THE PHILISTINES AND CUT OFF THE HEADS OF SIX HUNDRED OF THEM AND CAME TO THE KING AND BY SHOWING HIM THESE HEADS OF THE PHILISTINES REQUIRED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE ACCORDINGLY
