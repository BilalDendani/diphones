6707-77351-0000 I RECALL WITH A VIVID PRECISION HER QUEER START WHEN SHE HEARD THE RUSTLE OF MY APPROACHING FEET HER SURPRISE HER EYES ALMOST OF DISMAY FOR ME
6707-77351-0001 I COULD RECOLLECT I BELIEVE EVERY SIGNIFICANT WORD SHE SPOKE DURING OUR MEETING AND MOST OF WHAT I SAID TO HER AT LEAST IT SEEMS I COULD THOUGH INDEED I MAY DECEIVE MYSELF BUT I WILL NOT MAKE THE ATTEMPT
6707-77351-0002 WE STAMPED OUT OUR FEELINGS WITH CLUMSY STEREOTYPED PHRASES YOU WHO ARE BETTER TAUGHT WOULD FAIL TO CATCH OUR INTENTION THE EFFECT WOULD BE INANITY BUT OUR FIRST WORDS I MAY GIVE YOU
6707-77351-0003 AFTERWARDS THEY MEANT MUCH YOU WILLIE SHE SAID I HAVE COME I SAID FORGETTING IN THE INSTANT ALL THE ELABORATE THINGS I HAD INTENDED TO SAY I THOUGHT I WOULD SURPRISE YOU SURPRISE ME
6707-77351-0004 YES SHE STARED AT ME FOR A MOMENT I CAN SEE HER PRETTY FACE NOW AS IT LOOKED AT ME HER IMPENETRABLE DEAR FACE SHE LAUGHED A QUEER LITTLE LAUGH AND HER COLOR WENT FOR A MOMENT
6707-77351-0005 AND THEN SO SOON AS SHE HAD SPOKEN CAME BACK AGAIN SURPRISE ME AT WHAT SHE SAID WITH A RISING NOTE I WAS TOO INTENT TO EXPLAIN MYSELF TO THINK OF WHAT MIGHT LIE IN THAT I WANTED TO TELL YOU I SAID THAT I DIDN'T MEAN
6707-77351-0006 QUITE THE THINGS I PUT IN MY LETTER SECTION FOUR WHEN I AND NETTIE HAD BEEN SIXTEEN WE HAD BEEN JUST OF AN AGE AND CONTEMPORARIES ALTOGETHER
6707-77351-0007 NOW WE WERE A YEAR AND THREE QUARTERS OLDER AND SHE HER METAMORPHOSIS WAS ALMOST COMPLETE AND I WAS STILL ONLY AT THE BEGINNING OF A MAN'S LONG ADOLESCENCE
6707-77351-0008 IN AN INSTANT SHE GRASPED THE SITUATION THE HIDDEN MOTIVES OF HER QUICK RIPENED LITTLE MIND FLASHED OUT THEIR INTUITIVE SCHEME OF ACTION SHE TREATED ME WITH THAT NEAT PERFECTION OF UNDERSTANDING A YOUNG WOMAN HAS FOR A BOY
6707-77351-0009 BUT HOW DID YOU COME SHE ASKED I TOLD HER I HAD WALKED WALKED IN AN INSTANT SHE WAS LEADING ME TOWARDS THE GARDENS
6707-77351-0010 I MUST COME HOME WITH HER AT ONCE AND SIT DOWN INDEED IT WAS NEAR TEA TIME THE STUARTS HAD TEA AT THE OLD FASHIONED HOUR OF FIVE EVERY ONE WOULD BE SO SURPRISED TO SEE ME FANCY WALKING FANCY BUT
6707-77351-0011 SHE SUPPOSED A MAN THOUGHT NOTHING OF SEVENTEEN MILES WHEN COULD I HAVE STARTED ALL THE WHILE KEEPING ME AT A DISTANCE WITHOUT EVEN THE TOUCH OF HER HAND BUT NETTIE I CAME OVER TO TALK TO YOU MY DEAR BOY
6707-77351-0012 TEA FIRST IF YOU PLEASE AND BESIDES AREN'T WE TALKING THE DEAR BOY WAS A NEW NOTE THAT SOUNDED ODDLY TO ME SHE QUICKENED HER PACE A LITTLE I WANTED TO EXPLAIN I BEGAN
6707-77351-0013 WHEN WE WERE WELL PAST THE SHRUBBERY SHE SLACKENED A LITTLE IN HER URGENCY AND SO WE CAME ALONG THE SLOPE UNDER THE BEECHES TO THE GARDEN SHE KEPT HER BRIGHT STRAIGHTFORWARD LOOKING GIRLISH EYES ON ME AS WE WENT
6707-77351-0014 IT SEEMED SHE DID SO ALL THE TIME BUT NOW I KNOW BETTER THAN I DID THEN THAT EVERY NOW AND THEN SHE GLANCED OVER ME AND BEHIND ME TOWARDS THE SHRUBBERY
6707-77351-0015 AND ALL THE WHILE BEHIND HER QUICK BREATHLESS INCONSECUTIVE TALK SHE WAS THINKING HER DRESS MARKED THE END OF HER TRANSITION CAN I RECALL IT NOT I AM AFRAID IN THE TERMS A WOMAN WOULD USE
6707-77351-0016 WAS NOW CAUGHT UP INTO AN INTRICACY OF PRETTY CURVES ABOVE HER LITTLE EAR AND CHEEK AND THE SOFT LONG LINES OF HER NECK HER WHITE DRESS HAD DESCENDED TO HER FEET
6707-77351-0017 HER SLENDER WAIST WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN A MERE GEOGRAPHICAL EXPRESSION AN IMAGINARY LINE LIKE THE EQUATOR WAS NOW A THING OF FLEXIBLE BEAUTY
6707-77351-0018 EVERY MOVEMENT AND PARTICULARLY THE NOVEL DROOP OF HER HAND AND ARM TO THE UNACCUSTOMED SKIRTS SHE GATHERED ABOUT HER AND A GRACEFUL FORWARD INCLINATION THAT HAD COME TO HER CALLED SOFTLY TO MY EYES
6707-77351-0019 A VERY FINE SCARF I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD CALL IT A SCARF OF GREEN GOSSAMER THAT SOME NEW WAKENED INSTINCT HAD TOLD HER TO FLING ABOUT HER SHOULDERS CLUNG NOW CLOSELY TO THE YOUNG UNDULATIONS OF HER BODY
6707-77351-0020 AND LIKE SOME SHY INDEPENDENT TENTACLE WITH A SECRET TO IMPART CAME INTO MOMENTARY CONTACT WITH MY ARM SHE CAUGHT IT BACK AND REPROVED IT WE WENT THROUGH THE GREEN GATE IN THE HIGH GARDEN WALL
6707-77351-0021 I HELD IT OPEN FOR HER TO PASS THROUGH FOR THIS WAS ONE OF MY RESTRICTED STOCK OF STIFF POLITENESSES AND THEN FOR A SECOND SHE WAS NEAR TOUCHING ME
6707-77351-0022 SO WE CAME TO THE TRIM ARRAY OF FLOWER BEDS NEAR THE HEAD GARDENER'S COTTAGE AND THE VISTAS OF GLASS ON OUR LEFT
6707-77351-0023 AND SO WE CAME TO THE WISTARIA SMOTHERED PORCH THE DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN AND SHE WALKED IN BEFORE ME GUESS WHO HAS COME TO SEE US SHE CRIED HER FATHER ANSWERED INDISTINCTLY FROM THE PARLOR
6707-77351-0024 AND A CHAIR CREAKED I JUDGED HE WAS DISTURBED IN HIS NAP
6707-77351-0025 SHE TOLD THEM IN A MARVELING KEY THAT I HAD WALKED ALL THE WAY FROM CLAYTON AND THEY GATHERED ABOUT ME AND ECHOED HER NOTES OF SURPRISE YOU'D BETTER SIT DOWN WILLIE SAID HER FATHER NOW YOU HAVE GOT HERE HOW'S YOUR MOTHER
6707-77351-0026 HE LOOKED AT ME CURIOUSLY AS HE SPOKE HE WAS DRESSED IN HIS SUNDAY CLOTHES A SORT OF BROWNISH TWEEDS BUT THE WAISTCOAT WAS UNBUTTONED FOR GREATER COMFORT IN HIS SLUMBERS
6707-77351-0027 HE WAS A BROWN EYED RUDDY MAN AND I STILL HAVE NOW IN MY MIND THE BRIGHT EFFECT OF THE RED GOLDEN HAIRS THAT STARTED OUT FROM HIS CHEEK TO FLOW DOWN INTO HIS BEARD HE WAS SHORT BUT STRONGLY BUILT
6707-77351-0028 AND HIS BEARD AND MUSTACHE WERE THE BIGGEST THINGS ABOUT HIM
6707-77351-0029 HIS CLEAR SKIN HIS BRIGHT HAZEL BROWN EYES AND WEDDED THEM TO A CERTAIN QUICKNESS SHE GOT FROM HER MOTHER HER MOTHER I REMEMBER AS A SHARP EYED WOMAN OF GREAT ACTIVITY
6707-77351-0030 SHE SEEMS TO ME NOW TO HAVE BEEN PERPETUALLY BRINGING IN OR TAKING OUT MEALS OR DOING SOME SUCH SERVICE AND TO ME FOR MY MOTHER'S SAKE AND MY OWN SHE WAS ALWAYS WELCOMING AND KIND
6707-77351-0031 PUSS WAS A YOUNGSTER OF FOURTEEN PERHAPS OF WHOM A HARD BRIGHT STARE AND A PALE SKIN LIKE HER MOTHER'S ARE THE CHIEF TRACES ON MY MEMORY ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE VERY KIND TO ME
6707-77351-0032 AND AMONG THEM THERE WAS A COMMON RECOGNITION SOMETIMES VERY AGREEABLY FINDING EXPRESSION THAT I WAS CLEVER THEY ALL STOOD ABOUT ME AS IF THEY WERE A LITTLE AT A LOSS
6707-77351-0033 WE TALKED A LITTLE STIFFLY THEY WERE EVIDENTLY SURPRISED BY MY SUDDEN APPARITION DUSTY FATIGUED AND WHITE FACED
6707-77351-0034 THERE SHE CRIED SUDDENLY AS IF SHE WERE VEXED I DECLARE AND SHE DARTED OUT OF THE ROOM LORD WHAT A GIRL IT IS SAID MISSUS STUART I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S COME TO HER IT WAS HALF AN HOUR BEFORE NETTIE CAME BACK
6707-77351-0035 IT SEEMED A LONG TIME TO ME AND YET SHE HAD BEEN RUNNING FOR WHEN SHE CAME IN AGAIN SHE WAS OUT OF BREATH IN THE MEANTIME I HAD THROWN OUT CASUALLY THAT I HAD GIVEN UP MY PLACE AT RAWDON'S I CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT I SAID
6707-77351-0036 I LEFT MY BOOK IN THE DELL SHE SAID PANTING IS TEA READY AND THAT WAS HER APOLOGY WE DIDN'T SHAKE DOWN INTO COMFORT EVEN WITH THE COMING OF THE TEA THINGS TEA AT THE GARDENER'S COTTAGE WAS A SERIOUS MEAL
6707-77351-0037 WITH A BIG CAKE AND LITTLE CAKES AND PRESERVES AND FRUIT A FINE SPREAD UPON A TABLE YOU MUST IMAGINE ME SULLEN AWKWARD AND PREOCCUPIED PERPLEXED BY THE SOMETHING THAT WAS INEXPLICABLY UNEXPECTED IN NETTIE
6707-77351-0038 SAYING LITTLE AND GLOWERING ACROSS THE CAKE AT HER
6707-77351-0039 MISERABLY LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE BACK OF MY MIND NETTIE'S FATHER TRIED TO SET ME TALKING HE HAD A LIKING FOR MY GIFT OF READY SPEECH FOR HIS OWN IDEAS CAME WITH DIFFICULTY
6707-77351-0040 AND IT PLEASED AND ASTONISHED HIM TO HEAR ME POURING OUT MY VIEWS INDEED OVER THERE I WAS I THINK EVEN MORE TALKATIVE THAN WITH PARLOAD THOUGH TO THE WORLD AT LARGE I WAS A SHY YOUNG LOUT
6707-77351-0041 YOU OUGHT TO WRITE IT OUT FOR THE NEWSPAPERS HE USED TO SAY THAT'S WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO I NEVER HEARD SUCH NONSENSE OR
6707-77351-0042 BUT THAT AFTERNOON EVEN IN HIS EYES I DIDN'T SHINE
