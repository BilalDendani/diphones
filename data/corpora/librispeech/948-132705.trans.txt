948-132705-0000 IT IS DARK HERE IN THE FOREST THE LEAVES RUSTLE OVER OUR HEAD BLACK AGAINST THE LAST GOLD OF THE SKY THE MOSS IS SOFT AND WARM WE SHALL SLEEP ON THIS MOSS FOR MANY NIGHTS
948-132705-0001 TILL THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST COME TO TEAR OUR BODY WE HAVE NO BED NOW SAVE THE MOSS AND NO FUTURE SAVE THE BEASTS WE ARE OLD NOW YET WE WERE YOUNG THIS MORNING
948-132705-0002 WHEN WE CARRIED OUR GLASS BOX THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE CITY TO THE HOME OF THE SCHOLARS NO MEN STOPPED US
948-132705-0003 THEY WERE AS SHAPELESS CLOUDS HUDDLED AT THE RISE OF THE GREAT SKY
948-132705-0004 AND OTHERS FROM DISTANT LANDS WHOSE NAMES WE HAD NOT HEARD WE SAW A GREAT PAINTING ON THE WALL OVER THEIR HEADS OF THE TWENTY ILLUSTRIOUS MEN WHO HAD INVENTED THE CANDLE ALL THE HEADS OF THE COUNCIL TURNED TO US AS WE ENTERED
948-132705-0005 THESE GREAT AND WISE OF THE EARTH DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF US
948-132705-0006 AS IF WE WERE A MIRACLE IT IS TRUE THAT OUR TUNIC WAS TORN AND STAINED WITH BROWN STAINS WHICH HAD BEEN BLOOD WE RAISED OUR RIGHT ARM AND WE SAID OUR GREETING TO YOU OUR HONORED BROTHERS OF THE WORLD COUNCIL OF SCHOLARS
948-132705-0007 WHO ARE YOU OUR BROTHER FOR YOU DO NOT LOOK LIKE A SCHOLAR
948-132705-0008 THEN IT WAS AS IF A GREAT WIND HAD STRICKEN THE HALL FOR ALL THE SCHOLARS SPOKE AT ONCE AND THEY WERE ANGRY AND FRIGHTENED A STREET SWEEPER
948-132705-0009 A STREET SWEEPER WALKING IN UPON THE WORLD COUNCIL OF SCHOLARS IT IS NOT TO BE BELIEVED IT IS AGAINST ALL THE RULES AND ALL THE LAWS BUT WE KNEW HOW TO STOP THEM OUR BROTHERS WE SAID

948-132705-0012 AND THEY ALL BENT FORWARD AND SAT STILL WATCHING AND WE STOOD STILL OUR EYES UPON THE WIRE AND SLOWLY SLOWLY AS A FLUSH OF BLOOD A RED FLAME TREMBLED IN THE WIRE THEN THE WIRE GLOWED
948-132705-0013 BUT TERROR STRUCK THE MEN OF THE COUNCIL
948-132705-0014 WE LOOKED UPON THEM AND WE LAUGHED AND SAID FEAR NOTHING OUR BROTHERS THERE IS A GREAT POWER IN THESE WIRES BUT THIS POWER IS TAMED IT IS YOURS WE GIVE IT TO YOU STILL THEY WOULD NOT MOVE

948-132705-0027 MANY MEN IN THE HOMES OF THE SCHOLARS HAVE HAD STRANGE NEW IDEAS IN THE PAST
948-132705-0028 BUT WHEN THE MAJORITY OF THEIR BROTHER SCHOLARS VOTED AGAINST THEM THEY ABANDONED THEIR IDEAS AS ALL MEN MUST THIS BOX IS USELESS SAID ALLIANCE SIX SEVENTY THREE FORTY NINE

948-132705-0032 THEN IT IS A GREAT EVIL FOR MEN HAVE NO CAUSE TO EXIST SAVE IN TOILING FOR OTHER MEN
948-132705-0033 NINE ROSE AND POINTED AT OUR BOX THIS THING THEY SAID MUST BE DESTROYED AND ALL THE OTHERS CRIED AS ONE
948-132705-0034 IT MUST BE DESTROYED THEN WE LEAPT TO THE TABLE WE SEIZED OUR BOX WE SHOVED THEM ASIDE AND WE RAN TO THE WINDOW WE TURNED AND WE LOOKED AT THEM FOR THE LAST TIME AND A RAGE
948-132705-0035 DAMNED FOOLS WE SWUNG OUR FIST THROUGH THE WINDOWPANE AND WE LEAPT OUT IN A RINGING RAIN OF GLASS WE FELL BUT WE NEVER LET THE BOX FALL FROM OUR HANDS
948-132705-0036 THEN WE RAN WE RAN BLINDLY AND MEN AND HOUSES STREAKED PAST US IN A TORRENT WITHOUT SHAPE AND THE ROAD SEEMED NOT TO BE FLAT BEFORE US BUT AS IF IT WERE LEAPING UP TO MEET US AND WE WAITED FOR THE EARTH
948-132705-0037 TO RISE AND STRIKE US IN THE FACE BUT WE RAN WE KNEW NOT WHERE WE WERE GOING WE KNEW ONLY THAT WE MUST RUN RUN TO THE END OF THE WORLD TO THE END OF OUR DAYS
948-132705-0038 THEN WE KNEW SUDDENLY THAT WE WERE LYING ON A SOFT EARTH AND THAT WE HAD STOPPED
948-132705-0039 THEN WE KNEW WE WERE IN THE UNCHARTED FOREST WE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF COMING HERE BUT OUR LEGS HAD CARRIED OUR WISDOM AND OUR LEGS HAD BROUGHT US TO THE UNCHARTED FOREST AGAINST OUR WILL
948-132705-0040 OUR GLASS BOX LAY BESIDE US WE CRAWLED TO IT WE FELL UPON IT OUR FACE IN OUR ARMS AND WE LAY STILL WE LAY
948-132705-0041 THEN WE ROSE WE TOOK OUR BOX AND WALKED ON INTO THE FOREST IT MATTERED NOT WHERE WE WENT WE KNEW THAT MEN WOULD NOT FOLLOW US FOR THEY NEVER ENTER THE UNCHARTED FOREST
948-132705-0042 SO WE WALKED ON OUR BOX IN OUR ARMS OUR HEART EMPTY WE ARE DOOMED WHATEVER DAYS ARE LEFT TO US WE SHALL SPEND THEM ALONE
948-132705-0043 AND WE HAVE HEARD OF THE CORRUPTION TO BE FOUND IN SOLITUDE WE HAVE TORN OURSELVES FROM THE TRUTH WHICH IS OUR BROTHER MEN AND THERE IS NO ROAD BACK FOR US AND NO REDEMPTION WE KNOW THESE THINGS
948-132705-0044 BUT WE DO NOT CARE WE CARE FOR NOTHING ON EARTH WE ARE TIRED ONLY THE GLASS BOX IN OUR ARMS IS LIKE A LIVING HEART THAT GIVES US STRENGTH WE HAVE LIED TO OURSELVES
948-132705-0045 WE HAVE NOT BUILT THIS BOX FOR THE GOOD OF OUR BROTHERS WE BUILT IT FOR ITS OWN SAKE IT IS ABOVE ALL OUR BROTHERS TO US
948-132705-0046 ABOVE THEIR TRUTH WHY WONDER ABOUT THIS WE HAVE NOT MANY DAYS TO LIVE WE ARE WALKING TO THE FANGS AWAITING US SOMEWHERE AMONG THE GREAT SILENT TREES
948-132705-0047 THERE IS NOT A THING BEHIND US TO REGRET THEN A BLOW OF PAIN STRUCK US OUR FIRST AND OUR ONLY WE THOUGHT OF THE GOLDEN ONE
948-132705-0048 WE THOUGHT OF THE GOLDEN ONE WHOM WE SHALL NEVER SEE AGAIN THEN THE PAIN PASSED IT IS BEST
