331-884-0000 WHETHER IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TRY AND TELL THE STORY FROM THE BEGINNING AS IF IT WERE A STORY OR WHETHER TO TELL IT FROM THIS DISTANCE OF TIME AS IT REACHED ME FROM THE LIPS OF LEONORA OR FROM THOSE OF EDWARD HIMSELF
331-884-0001 AND I SHALL GO ON TALKING IN A LOW VOICE WHILE THE SEA SOUNDS IN THE DISTANCE AND OVERHEAD THE GREAT BLACK FLOOD OF WIND POLISHES THE BRIGHT STARS FROM TIME TO TIME WE SHALL GET UP AND GO TO THE DOOR AND LOOK OUT AT THE GREAT MOON AND SAY
331-884-0002 WHY IT IS NEARLY AS BRIGHT AS IN PROVENCE AND THEN WE SHALL COME BACK TO THE FIRESIDE WITH JUST THE TOUCH OF A SIGH BECAUSE WE ARE NOT IN THAT PROVENCE WHERE EVEN THE SADDEST STORIES ARE GAY CONSIDER THE LAMENTABLE HISTORY OF PEIRE VIDAL
331-884-0003 WHICH IS IN THE BLACK MOUNTAINS IN THE MIDDLE OF A TORTUOUS VALLEY THERE RISES UP AN IMMENSE PINNACLE AND ON THE PINNACLE ARE FOUR CASTLES LAS TOURS THE TOWERS
331-884-0004 AND THE IMMENSE MISTRAL BLEW DOWN THAT VALLEY WHICH WAS THE WAY FROM FRANCE INTO PROVENCE SO THAT THE SILVER GREY OLIVE LEAVES APPEARED LIKE HAIR FLYING IN THE WIND
331-884-0005 AND THE TUFTS OF ROSEMARY CREPT INTO THE IRON ROCKS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE TORN UP BY THE ROOTS IT WAS OF COURSE POOR DEAR FLORENCE WHO WANTED TO GO TO LAS TOURS
331-884-0006 SHE WAS YET A GRADUATE OF POUGHKEEPSIE I NEVER COULD IMAGINE HOW SHE DID IT THE QUEER CHATTERY PERSON THAT SHE WAS WITH THE FAR AWAY LOOK IN HER EYES WHICH WASN'T HOWEVER IN THE LEAST ROMANTIC
331-884-0007 I MEAN THAT SHE DIDN'T LOOK AS IF SHE WERE SEEING POETIC DREAMS OR LOOKING THROUGH YOU FOR SHE HARDLY EVER DID LOOK AT YOU HOLDING UP ONE HAND AS IF SHE WISHED TO SILENCE ANY OBJECTION OR ANY COMMENT FOR THE MATTER OF THAT SHE WOULD TALK
331-884-0008 SHE WOULD TALK ABOUT WILLIAM THE SILENT ABOUT GUSTAVE THE LOQUACIOUS ABOUT PARIS FROCKS ABOUT HOW THE POOR DRESSED IN THIRTEEN THIRTY SEVEN ABOUT FANTIN LATOUR
331-884-0009 OVER THE RHONE TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT BEAUCAIRE WE NEVER DID TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT BEAUCAIRE OF COURSE BEAUTIFUL BEAUCAIRE WITH THE HIGH TRIANGULAR WHITE TOWER THAT LOOKED AS THIN AS A NEEDLE AND AS TALL AS THE FLATIRON BETWEEN FIFTH AND BROADWAY
331-884-0010 BENEATH THE TALLNESS OF THE STONE PINES WHAT A BEAUTIFUL THING THE STONE PINE IS NO WE NEVER DID GO BACK ANYWHERE NOT TO HEIDELBERG NOT TO HAMELIN NOT TO VERONA NOT TO MONT MAJOUR
331-884-0011 NOT SO MUCH AS TO CARCASSONNE ITSELF WE TALKED OF IT OF COURSE BUT I GUESS FLORENCE GOT ALL SHE WANTED OUT OF ONE LOOK AT A PLACE SHE HAD THE SEEING EYE I HAVEN'T UNFORTUNATELY SO THAT THE WORLD IS FULL OF PLACES TO WHICH I WANT TO RETURN
331-884-0012 TOWNS WITH THE BLINDING WHITE SUN UPON THEM STONE PINES AGAINST THE BLUE OF THE SKY CORNERS OF GABLES ALL CARVED AND PAINTED WITH STAGS AND SCARLET FLOWERS AND CROWSTEPPED GABLES WITH THE LITTLE SAINT AT THE TOP
331-884-0013 AND GREY AND PINK PALAZZI AND WALLED TOWNS A MILE OR SO BACK FROM THE SEA ON THE MEDITERRANEAN BETWEEN LEGHORN AND NAPLES NOT ONE OF THEM DID WE SEE MORE THAN ONCE
331-884-0014 PERHAPS IF IT WEREN'T SO I SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO CATCH HOLD OF NOW IS ALL THIS DIGRESSION OR ISN'T IT DIGRESSION AGAIN I DON'T KNOW YOU THE LISTENER SIT OPPOSITE ME BUT
331-884-0015 YOU ARE SO SILENT YOU DON'T TELL ME ANYTHING I AM AT ANY RATE TRYING TO GET YOU TO SEE WHAT SORT OF LIFE IT WAS I LED WITH FLORENCE AND WHAT FLORENCE WAS LIKE WELL SHE WAS BRIGHT AND SHE DANCED
331-884-0016 SHE SEEMED TO DANCE OVER THE FLOORS OF CASTLES AND OVER SEAS AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER THE SALONS OF MODISTES AND OVER THE PLAGES OF THE RIVIERA LIKE A GAY TREMULOUS BEAM REFLECTED FROM WATER UPON A CEILING
331-884-0017 FLORENCE'S AUNTS USED TO SAY THAT I MUST BE THE LAZIEST MAN IN PHILADELPHIA THEY HAD NEVER BEEN TO PHILADELPHIA AND THEY HAD THE NEW ENGLAND CONSCIENCE YOU SEE THE FIRST THING THEY SAID TO ME WHEN I CALLED IN ON FLORENCE IN THE LITTLE ANCIENT COLONIAL WOODEN HOUSE
331-884-0018 BENEATH THE HIGH THIN LEAVED ELMS THE FIRST QUESTION THEY ASKED ME WAS NOT HOW I DID BUT WHAT DID I DO AND I DID NOTHING
331-884-0019 I DIDN'T SEE ANY CALL TO DO IT WHY DOES ONE DO THINGS I JUST DRIFTED IN AND WANTED FLORENCE
331-884-0020 WHICH WAS THEN STILL RESIDENTIAL I DON'T KNOW WHY I HAD GONE TO NEW YORK I DON'T KNOW WHY I HAD GONE TO THE TEA I DON'T SEE WHY FLORENCE SHOULD HAVE GONE TO THAT SORT OF SPELLING BEE
331-884-0021 I GUESS FLORENCE WANTED TO RAISE THE CULTURE OF THE STUYVESANT CROWD AND DID IT AS SHE MIGHT HAVE GONE IN SLUMMING INTELLECTUAL SLUMMING THAT WAS WHAT IT WAS SHE ALWAYS WANTED TO LEAVE THE WORLD A LITTLE MORE ELEVATED THAN SHE FOUND IT POOR DEAR THING
331-884-0022 I HAVE HEARD HER LECTURE TEDDY ASHBURNHAM BY THE HOUR ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FRANZ HALS AND A WOUVERMANS AND WHY THE PRE MYCENAEAN STATUES WERE CUBICAL WITH KNOBS ON THE TOP I WONDER WHAT HE MADE OF IT PERHAPS HE WAS THANKFUL
331-884-0023 I KNOW I WAS FOR DO YOU UNDERSTAND MY WHOLE ATTENTIONS MY WHOLE ENDEAVOURS WERE TO KEEP POOR DEAR FLORENCE ON TO TOPICS LIKE THE FINDS AT CNOSSOS AND THE MENTAL SPIRITUALITY OF WALTER PATER
331-884-0024 I HAD TO KEEP HER AT IT YOU UNDERSTAND OR SHE MIGHT DIE FOR I WAS SOLEMNLY INFORMED THAT IF SHE BECAME EXCITED OVER ANYTHING OR IF HER
331-884-0025 EMOTIONS WERE REALLY STIRRED HER LITTLE HEART MIGHT CEASE TO BEAT FOR TWELVE YEARS I HAD TO WATCH EVERY WORD THAT ANY PERSON UTTERED IN ANY CONVERSATION AND I HAD TO HEAD IT OFF WHAT THE ENGLISH CALL THINGS OFF LOVE POVERTY CRIME
331-884-0026 THAT IS WHAT MAKES ME THINK OF THAT FELLOW PEIRE VIDAL BECAUSE OF COURSE HIS STORY IS CULTURE AND I HAD TO HEAD HER TOWARDS CULTURE AND AT THE SAME TIME IT'S SO FUNNY AND SHE HADN'T GOT TO LAUGH AND IT'S SO FULL OF LOVE AND SHE WASN'T TO THINK OF LOVE
331-884-0027 LAS TOURS OF THE FOUR CASTLES HAD
331-884-0028 AND SHE WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM SO OUT OF COMPLIMENT TO HER THE THINGS PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY'RE IN LOVE HE DRESSED HIMSELF UP IN WOLFSKINS AND WENT UP INTO THE BLACK MOUNTAINS AND THE
331-884-0029 THEY POLISHED HIM UP AND HER HUSBAND REMONSTRATED SERIOUSLY WITH HER VIDAL WAS YOU SEE A GREAT POET AND IT WAS NOT PROPER TO TREAT A GREAT POET WITH INDIFFERENCE SO PEIRE VIDAL DECLARED HIMSELF EMPEROR OF JERUSALEM OR SOMEWHERE
331-884-0030 AND THE HUSBAND HAD TO KNEEL DOWN AND KISS HIS FEET THOUGH LA LOUVE WOULDN'T AND PEIRE SET SAIL IN A ROWING BOAT WITH FOUR COMPANIONS TO REDEEM THE HOLY SEPULCHRE AND THEY STRUCK ON A ROCK SOMEWHERE AND AT GREAT EXPENSE THE HUSBAND HAD TO FIT OUT AN EXPEDITION TO FETCH HIM BACK AND
331-884-0031 PEIRE VIDAL FELL ALL OVER THE LADY'S BED WHILE THE HUSBAND WHO WAS A MOST FEROCIOUS WARRIOR REMONSTRATED SOME MORE ABOUT THE COURTESY THAT IS DUE TO GREAT POETS BUT I SUPPOSE LA LOUVE WAS THE MORE FEROCIOUS OF THE TWO ANYHOW
331-884-0032 THAT A STORY YOU HAVEN'T AN IDEA OF THE QUEER OLD FASHIONEDNESS OF FLORENCE'S AUNTS THE MISSES HURLBIRD NOR YET OF HER UNCLE AN EXTRAORDINARILY LOVABLE MAN THAT UNCLE JOHN
331-884-0033 THIN GENTLE AND WITH A HEART THAT MADE HIS LIFE VERY MUCH WHAT FLORENCE'S AFTERWARDS BECAME HE DIDN'T RESIDE AT STAMFORD HIS HOME WAS IN WATERBURY WHERE THE WATCHES COME FROM
331-884-0034 FOR NINE MONTHS OR SO IT WOULD MANUFACTURE BUTTONS OUT OF BONE THEN IT WOULD SUDDENLY PRODUCE BRASS BUTTONS FOR COACHMEN'S LIVERIES THEN IT WOULD TAKE A TURN AT EMBOSSED TIN LIDS FOR CANDY BOXES
331-884-0035 THE FACT IS THAT THE POOR OLD GENTLEMAN WITH HIS WEAK AND FLUTTERING HEART DIDN'T WANT HIS FACTORY TO MANUFACTURE ANYTHING AT ALL HE WANTED TO RETIRE AND HE DID RETIRE WHEN HE WAS SEVENTY BUT HE WAS SO WORRIED AT HAVING ALL THE STREET BOYS IN THE TOWN POINT AFTER HIM AND EXCLAIM
331-884-0036 THAT HE TRIED TAKING A TOUR ROUND THE WORLD AND FLORENCE AND A YOUNG MAN CALLED JIMMY WENT WITH HIM
331-884-0037 HE HAD TO KEEP HIM FOR INSTANCE OUT OF POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS
331-884-0038 HE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF INFLUENCE IN FORMING THE CHARACTER OF MY POOR DEAR WIFE JUST BEFORE THEY SET OUT FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR THE SOUTH SEAS
331-884-0039 AND IT STRUCK HIM THAT THE THINGS TO TAKE FOR THAT PURPOSE WERE ORANGES BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS THE ORANGE COUNTRY AND COMFORTABLE FOLDING CHAIRS SO HE BOUGHT I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY CASES OF ORANGES THE GREAT COOL CALIFORNIA ORANGES
331-884-0040 AND HALF A DOZEN FOLDING CHAIRS IN A SPECIAL CASE THAT HE ALWAYS KEPT IN HIS CABIN THERE MUST HAVE BEEN HALF A CARGO OF FRUIT FOR TO EVERY PERSON ON BOARD THE SEVERAL STEAMERS THAT THEY EMPLOYED TO EVERY PERSON WITH WHOM HE HAD SO MUCH AS A NODDING ACQUAINTANCE
331-884-0041 HE GAVE AN ORANGE EVERY MORNING AND THEY LASTED HIM RIGHT ROUND THE GIRDLE OF THIS MIGHTY GLOBE OF OURS WHEN THEY WERE AT NORTH CAPE EVEN HE SAW ON THE HORIZON POOR DEAR THIN MAN THAT HE WAS A LIGHTHOUSE
331-884-0042 THESE FELLOWS MUST BE VERY LONELY LET'S TAKE THEM SOME ORANGES SO HE HAD A BOATLOAD OF HIS FRUIT OUT AND HAD HIMSELF ROWED TO THE LIGHTHOUSE ON THE HORIZON THE FOLDING CHAIRS HE LENT TO ANY LADY THAT HE CAME ACROSS AND LIKED OR WHO SEEMED TIRED AND INVALIDISH ON THE SHIP
331-884-0043 AND SO GUARDED AGAINST HIS HEART AND HAVING HIS NIECE WITH HIM HE WENT ROUND THE WORLD HE WASN'T OBTRUSIVE ABOUT HIS HEART YOU WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN HE HAD ONE HE ONLY LEFT IT TO THE PHYSICAL LABORATORY AT WATERBURY FOR THE BENEFIT OF SCIENCE
331-884-0044 IT HAD CERTAINLY JUMPED OR SQUEAKED OR SOMETHING JUST SUFFICIENTLY TO TAKE IN THE DOCTORS BUT IT APPEARS THAT THAT WAS BECAUSE OF AN ODD FORMATION OF THE LUNGS I DON'T MUCH UNDERSTAND ABOUT THESE MATTERS
331-884-0045 AND I HAD TO APPOINT TRUSTEES I DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF THEIR NOT BEING PROPERLY HANDLED YES IT WAS A GREAT WORRY AND JUST AS I HAD GOT THINGS ROUGHLY SETTLED I RECEIVED THE EXTRAORDINARY CABLE FROM ASHBURNHAM BEGGING ME TO COME BACK AND
331-884-0046 HAVE A TALK WITH HIM AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS CAME ONE FROM LEONORA SAYING YES PLEASE DO COME YOU COULD BE SO HELPFUL IT WAS AS IF HE HAD SENT THE CABLE WITHOUT CONSULTING HER AND HAD AFTERWARDS TOLD HER INDEED THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH WHAT HAD HAPPENED EXCEPT THAT
331-884-0047 HE HAD TOLD THE GIRL AND THE GIRL TOLD THE WIFE I ARRIVED HOWEVER TOO LATE TO BE OF ANY GOOD IF I COULD HAVE BEEN OF ANY GOOD AND THEN I HAD MY FIRST TASTE OF ENGLISH LIFE IT WAS AMAZING IT WAS OVERWHELMING
331-884-0048 THE ANIMAL'S ACTION ITS HIGH STEPPING ITS SKIN THAT WAS LIKE SATIN AND THE PEACE AND THE RED CHEEKS AND THE BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL OLD HOUSE JUST NEAR BRANSHAW TELERAGH IT WAS
331-884-0049 AND WE DESCENDED ON IT FROM THE HIGH CLEAR WINDSWEPT WASTE OF THE NEW FOREST I TELL YOU IT WAS AMAZING TO ARRIVE THERE FROM WATERBURY AND IT CAME INTO MY HEAD
331-884-0050 THAT IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE THAT ANYTHING ESSENTIALLY CALAMITOUS COULD HAPPEN TO THAT PLACE AND THOSE PEOPLE I TELL YOU IT WAS THE VERY SPIRIT OF PEACE AND LEONORA BEAUTIFUL AND SMILING WITH HER COILS OF YELLOW HAIR
331-884-0051 STOOD ON THE TOP DOORSTEP WITH A BUTLER AND FOOTMAN AND A MAID OR SO BEHIND HER AND SHE JUST SAID SO GLAD YOU'VE COME AS IF I'D RUN DOWN TO LUNCH FROM A TOWN TEN MILES AWAY INSTEAD OF HAVING COME HALF THE WORLD OVER AT THE CALL OF TWO URGENT TELEGRAMS
331-884-0052 THE GIRL WAS OUT WITH THE HOUNDS I THINK AND THAT POOR DEVIL BESIDE ME WAS IN AN AGONY
