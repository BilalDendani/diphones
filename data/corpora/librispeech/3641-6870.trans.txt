3641-6870-0000 I WENT AT ONCE TO THE CONVENT THE PARLOUR WAS FULL BUT THANKS TO MY COSTUME OF PIERROT WHICH WAS SEEN IN VENICE BUT VERY SELDOM EVERYBODY MADE ROOM FOR ME I WALKED ON ASSUMING THE GAIT OF A BOOBY THE TRUE CHARACTERISTIC OF MY COSTUME
3641-6870-0001 AND I STOPPED NEAR THE DANCERS AFTER I HAD EXAMINED THE PANTALOONS PUNCHES HARLEQUINS AND MERRY ANDREWS I WENT NEAR THE GRATING WHERE I SAW ALL THE NUNS AND BOARDERS SOME SEATED SOME STANDING AND WITHOUT APPEARING TO NOTICE ANY OF THEM IN PARTICULAR
3641-6870-0002 I REMARKED MY TWO FRIENDS TOGETHER AND VERY INTENT UPON THE DANCERS I THEN WALKED ROUND THE ROOM EYEING EVERYBODY FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND CALLING THE GENERAL ATTENTION UPON MYSELF
3641-6870-0003 AND WITH SUCH AN AIR OF STUPIDITY THAT EVERYBODY LAUGHED AND MADE ROOM FOR US MY PARTNER DANCED VERY WELL ACCORDING TO HER COSTUME AND I KEPT MY CHARACTER WITH SUCH PERFECTION THAT THE LAUGHTER WAS GENERAL
3641-6870-0004 AFTER THE MINUET I DANCED TWELVE FORLANAS WITH THE GREATEST VIGOUR OUT OF BREATH I THREW MYSELF ON A SOFA PRETENDING TO GO TO SLEEP AND THE MOMENT I BEGAN TO SNORE EVERYBODY RESPECTED THE SLUMBERS OF PIERROT
3641-6870-0005 THE QUADRILLE LASTED ONE HOUR AND I TOOK NO PART IN IT BUT IMMEDIATELY AFTER IT A HARLEQUIN APPROACHED ME WITH THE IMPERTINENCE WHICH BELONGS TO HIS COSTUME AND FLOGGED ME WITH HIS WAND IT IS HARLEQUIN'S WEAPON
3641-6870-0006 IN MY QUALITY OF PIERROT I HAD NO WEAPONS I SEIZED HIM ROUND THE WAIST AND CARRIED HIM ROUND THE PARLOUR RUNNING ALL THE TIME WHILE HE KEPT ON FLOGGING ME I THEN PUT HIM DOWN ADROITLY SNATCHING HIS WAND OUT OF HIS HAND I LIFTED HIS COLUMBINE ON MY SHOULDERS AND PURSUED HIM
3641-6870-0007 STRIKING HIM WITH THE WAND TO THE GREAT DELIGHT AND MIRTH OF THE COMPANY THE COLUMBINE WAS SCREAMING BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID OF MY TUMBLING DOWN AND OF SHEWING HER CENTRE OF GRAVITY TO EVERYBODY IN THE FALL
3641-6870-0008 SHE HAD GOOD REASON TO FEAR FOR SUDDENLY A FOOLISH MERRY ANDREW CAME BEHIND ME TRIPPED ME UP AND DOWN I TUMBLED EVERYBODY HOOTED MASTER PUNCH I QUICKLY PICKED MYSELF UP AND RATHER VEXED I BEGAN A REGULAR FIGHT WITH THE INSOLENT FELLOW
3641-6870-0009 HE WAS OF MY SIZE BUT AWKWARD AND HE HAD NOTHING BUT STRENGTH I THREW HIM AND SHAKING HIM VIGOROUSLY ON ALL SIDES I CONTRIVED TO DEPRIVE HIM OF HIS HUMP AND FALSE STOMACH THE NUNS WHO HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH A MERRY SIGHT CLAPPED THEIR HANDS
3641-6870-0010 EVERYBODY LAUGHED LOUDLY AND IMPROVING MY OPPORTUNITY I RAN THROUGH THE CROWD AND DISAPPEARED I WAS IN A PERSPIRATION AND THE WEATHER WAS COLD I THREW MYSELF INTO A GONDOLA AND IN ORDER NOT TO GET CHILLED I LANDED AT THE RIDOTTO
3641-6870-0011 I HAD TWO HOURS TO SPARE BEFORE GOING TO THE CASINO OF MURAN AND I LONGED TO ENJOY THE ASTONISHMENT OF MY BEAUTIFUL NUN WHEN SHE SAW
3641-6870-0012 I SPENT THOSE TWO HOURS IN PLAYING AT ALL THE BANKS WINNING LOSING AND PERFORMING ALL SORTS OF ANTICS WITH COMPLETE FREEDOM BEING SATISFIED THAT NO ONE COULD RECOGNIZE ME ENJOYING THE PRESENT BIDDING DEFIANCE TO THE FUTURE
3641-6870-0013 AND LAUGHING AT ALL THOSE REASONABLE BEINGS WHO EXERCISE THEIR REASON TO AVOID THE MISFORTUNES WHICH THEY FEAR DESTROYING AT THE SAME TIME THE PLEASURE THAT THEY MIGHT ENJOY
3641-6870-0014 BUT TWO O'CLOCK STRUCK AND GAVE ME WARNING THAT LOVE AND COMUS WERE CALLING ME TO BESTOW NEW DELIGHTS UPON ME WITH MY POCKETS FULL OF GOLD AND SILVER I LEFT THE RIDOTTO HURRIED TO MURAN
3641-6870-0015 ENTERED THE SANCTUARY AND SAW MY DIVINITY LEANING AGAINST THE MANTELPIECE SHE WORE HER CONVENT DRESS I COME NEAR HER BY STEALTH IN ORDER TO ENJOY HER SURPRISE I LOOK AT HER AND I REMAIN PETRIFIED ASTOUNDED THE PERSON I SEE IS NOT M M
3641-6870-0016 IT IS C C DRESSED AS A NUN WHO MORE ASTONISHED EVEN THAN MYSELF DOES NOT UTTER ONE WORD OR MAKE A MOVEMENT I THROW MYSELF IN AN ARM CHAIR IN ORDER TO BREATHE AND TO RECOVER FROM MY SURPRISE THE SIGHT OF C C HAD ANNIHILATED ME
3641-6870-0017 AND MY MIND WAS AS MUCH STUPEFIED AS MY BODY I FOUND MYSELF IN AN INEXTRICABLE MAZE IT IS M M I SAID TO MYSELF WHO HAS PLAYED THAT TRICK UPON ME BUT HOW HAS SHE CONTRIVED TO KNOW THAT I AM THE LOVER OF C C
3641-6870-0018 HAS C C BETRAYED MY SECRET BUT IF SHE HAS BETRAYED IT HOW COULD M M DEPRIVE HERSELF OF THE PLEASURE OF SEEING ME AND CONSENT TO HER PLACE BEING TAKEN BY HER FRIEND AND RIVAL THAT CANNOT BE A MARK OF KIND COMPLIANCE FOR A WOMAN NEVER CARRIES IT TO SUCH AN EXTREME
3641-6870-0019 I SEE IN IT ONLY A MARK OF CONTEMPT A GRATUITOUS INSULT MY SELF LOVE TRIED HARD TO IMAGINE SOME REASON LIKELY TO DISPROVE THE POSSIBILITY OF THAT CONTEMPT BUT IN VAIN
3641-6870-0020 ABSORBED IN THAT DARK DISCONTENT I BELIEVED MYSELF WANTONLY TRIFLED WITH DECEIVED DESPISED AND I SPENT HALF AN HOUR SILENT AND GLOOMY STARING AT C C WHO SCARCELY DARED TO BREATHE PERPLEXED CONFUSED AND NOT KNOWING IN WHOSE PRESENCE SHE WAS
3641-6870-0021 DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH M M AND HAVING COME TO THE CASINO ONLY FOR HER I DID NOT FEEL DISPOSED TO ACCEPT THE EXCHANGE ALTHOUGH I WAS VERY FAR FROM DESPISING C C WHOSE CHARMS WERE AS GREAT AT LEAST AS THOSE OF M M
3641-6870-0022 I LOVED HER TENDERLY I ADORED HER BUT AT THAT MOMENT IT WAS NOT HER WHOM I WANTED BECAUSE AT FIRST HER PRESENCE HAD STRUCK ME AS A MYSTIFICATION IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IF I CELEBRATED THE RETURN OF C C IN AN AMOROUS MANNER
3641-6870-0023 I WOULD FAIL IN WHAT I OWED TO MYSELF AND I THOUGHT THAT I WAS BOUND IN HONOUR NOT TO LEND MYSELF TO THE IMPOSITION BESIDES WITHOUT EXACTLY REALIZING THAT FEELING I WAS NOT SORRY TO HAVE IT IN MY POWER TO REPROACH M M WITH AN INDIFFERENCE VERY STRANGE IN A WOMAN
3641-6870-0024 IN LOVE AND I WANTED TO ACT IN SUCH A MANNER THAT SHE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SAY THAT SHE HAD PROCURED ME A PLEASURE I MUST ADD THAT I SUSPECTED M M TO BE HIDING IN THE SECRET CLOSET PERHAPS WITH HER FRIEND
3641-6870-0025 AT FIRST I THOUGHT OF GOING AWAY THE MORE SO THAT BOTH C C AND HER FRIEND COULD NOT BE CERTAIN THAT I AND PIERROT WERE THE SAME INDIVIDUAL BUT I SOON ABANDONED THE IDEA WITH HORROR
3641-6870-0026 I ALMOST FANCIED THAT SHE KNEW IT ALREADY AND I SHARED THE GRIEF WHICH SHE EVIDENTLY WOULD FEEL IN THAT CASE I HAD SEDUCED HER I HAD GIVEN HER THE RIGHT TO CALL ME HER HUSBAND THESE THOUGHTS BROKE MY HEART
3641-6870-0027 SHE WILL SHEW HERSELF IN GOOD TIME WITH THAT IDEA I TOOK OFF THE GAUZE WHICH COVERED MY FEATURES MY LOVELY C C GAVE A DEEP SIGH AND SAID I BREATHE AGAIN IT COULD NOT BE ANYONE BUT YOU MY HEART FELT IT
3641-6870-0028 YOU SEEMED SURPRISED WHEN YOU SAW ME DEAREST DID YOU NOT KNOW THAT I WAS WAITING FOR YOU I HAD NOT THE FAINTEST IDEA OF IT IF YOU ARE ANGRY I REGRET IT DEEPLY BUT I AM INNOCENT MY ADORED FRIEND COME TO MY ARMS AND NEVER SUPPOSE THAT I CAN BE ANGRY WITH YOU
3641-6870-0029 I I WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF SUCH A THING EVEN IF DEATH HAD STARED ME IN THE FACE THEN HOW DID YOU COME HERE HOW DID YOUR FRIEND CONTRIVE TO DISCOVER EVERYTHING
3641-6870-0030 LAURA PERHAPS NO LAURA IS FAITHFUL DEAREST AND I CANNOT GUESS HOW IT WAS BUT HOW COULD YOU BE PERSUADED TO ASSUME THAT DISGUISE AND TO COME HERE YOU CAN LEAVE THE CONVENT AND YOU HAVE NEVER APPRISED ME OF THAT IMPORTANT CIRCUMSTANCE
3641-6870-0031 CAN YOU SUPPOSE THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE TOLD YOU ALL ABOUT IT IF I HAD EVER LEFT THE CONVENT EVEN ONCE
3641-6870-0032 TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT MY LOVE I FEEL EXTREMELY CURIOUS I AM GLAD OF IT AND I WOULD CONCEAL NOTHING FROM YOU YOU KNOW HOW DEARLY M M AND I LOVE EACH OTHER NO INTIMACY COULD BE MORE TENDER THAN OURS YOU CAN JUDGE OF IT BY WHAT I TOLD YOU IN MY LETTERS
3641-6870-0033 WELL TWO DAYS AGO MY DEAR FRIEND BEGGED THE ABBESS AND MY AUNT TO ALLOW ME TO SLEEP IN HER ROOM IN THE PLACE OF THE LAY SISTER WHO HAVING A VERY BAD COLD HAD CARRIED HER COUGH TO THE INFIRMARY
3641-6870-0034 THE PERMISSION WAS GRANTED AND YOU CANNOT IMAGINE OUR PLEASURE IN SEEING OURSELVES AT LIBERTY FOR THE FIRST TIME TO SLEEP IN THE SAME BED TO DAY SHORTLY AFTER YOU HAD LEFT THE PARLOUR WHERE YOU SO MUCH AMUSED US WITHOUT OUR DISCOVERING THAT THE DELIGHTFUL PIERROT WAS OUR FRIEND
3641-6870-0035 MY DEAR M M RETIRED TO HER ROOM AND I FOLLOWED HER THE MOMENT WE WERE ALONE SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WANTED ME TO RENDER HER A SERVICE FROM WHICH DEPENDED OUR HAPPINESS I NEED NOT TELL YOU HOW READILY I ANSWERED THAT SHE HAD ONLY TO NAME IT
3641-6870-0036 THEN SHE OPENED A DRAWER AND MUCH TO MY SURPRISE SHE DRESSED ME IN THIS COSTUME SHE WAS LAUGHING AND I DID THE SAME WITHOUT SUSPECTING THE END OF THE JOKE
3641-6870-0037 WHEN SHE SAW ME ENTIRELY METAMORPHOSED INTO A NUN SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS GOING TO TRUST ME WITH A GREAT SECRET BUT THAT SHE ENTERTAINED NO FEAR OF MY DISCRETION LET ME TELL YOU CLEAREST FRIEND SHE SAID TO ME THAT I WAS ON THE POINT OF GOING OUT OF THE CONVENT TO RETURN ONLY TOMORROW MORNING
3641-6870-0038 I HAVE HOWEVER JUST DECIDED THAT YOU SHALL GO INSTEAD YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR AND YOU DO NOT REQUIRE ANY INSTRUCTIONS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU WILL MEET WITH NO DIFFICULTY IN AN HOUR A LAY SISTER WILL COME HERE I WILL SPEAK A FEW WORDS APART TO HER
3641-6870-0039 AND SHE WILL TELL YOU TO FOLLOW HER YOU WILL GO OUT WITH HER THROUGH THE SMALL GATE AND ACROSS THE GARDEN AS FAR AS THE ROOM LEADING OUT TO THE LOW SHORE THERE YOU WILL GET INTO THE GONDOLA AND SAY TO THE GONDOLIER THESE WORDS TO THE CASINO
3641-6870-0040 YOU WILL REACH IT IN FIVE MINUTES YOU WILL STEP OUT AND ENTER A SMALL APARTMENT WHERE YOU WILL FIND A GOOD FIRE YOU WILL BE ALONE AND YOU WILL WAIT FOR WHOM I ENQUIRED FOR NOBODY YOU NEED NOT KNOW ANY MORE
3641-6870-0041 YOU MAY ONLY BE CERTAIN THAT NOTHING UNPLEASANT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TRUST ME FOR THAT YOU WILL SUP AT THE CASINO AND SLEEP IF YOU LIKE WITHOUT BEING DISTURBED DO NOT ASK ANY QUESTIONS FOR I CANNOT ANSWER THEM SUCH IS MY DEAR HUSBAND THE WHOLE TRUTH
3641-6870-0042 TELL ME NOW WHAT I COULD DO AFTER THAT SPEECH OF MY FRIEND AND AFTER SHE HAD RECEIVED MY PROMISE TO DO WHATEVER SHE WISHED DO NOT DISTRUST WHAT I TELL YOU FOR MY LIPS CANNOT UTTER A FALSEHOOD
3641-6870-0043 I LAUGHED AND NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING ELSE BUT AN AGREEABLE ADVENTURE I FOLLOWED THE LAY SISTER AND SOON FOUND MYSELF HERE
3641-6870-0044 BE QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE VERY MOMENT I SAW YOU MY HEART KNEW WHO IT WAS BUT A MINUTE AFTER I FELT AS IF THE LIGHTNING HAD STRUCK ME WHEN I SAW YOU STEP BACK FOR I SAW CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT YOU DID NOT EXPECT TO FIND ME
3641-6870-0045 YOUR GLOOMY SILENCE FRIGHTENED ME AND I WOULD NEVER HAVE DARED TO BE THE FIRST IN BREAKING IT THE MORE SO THAT IN SPITE OF THE FEELINGS OF MY HEART I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN
3641-6870-0046 RECOLLECT THAT FOR THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS I HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE HAPPINESS OF KISSING YOU AND NOW THAT YOU MUST BE CERTAIN OF MY INNOCENCE ALLOW ME TO CONGRATULATE YOU UPON KNOWING THIS CASINO YOU ARE HAPPY AND I CONGRATULATE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART
3641-6870-0047 M M IS AFTER ME THE ONLY WOMAN WORTHY OF YOUR LOVE THE ONLY ONE WITH WHOM I COULD CONSENT TO SHARE IT I USED TO PITY YOU BUT I DO SO NO LONGER AND YOUR HAPPINESS MAKES ME HAPPY KISS ME NOW
3641-6870-0048 I SHOULD HAVE BEEN VERY UNGRATEFUL I SHOULD EVEN HAVE BEEN CRUEL IF I HAD NOT
3641-6870-0049 AFTER ASSURING HER THAT I NO LONGER ENTERTAINED ANY DOUBT OF HER INNOCENCE I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THE BEHAVIOUR OF HER FRIEND VERY AMBIGUOUS I SAID THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE PLEASURE I FELT IN SEEING HER THE TRICK PLAYED UPON ME BY HER FRIEND WAS A VERY BAD ONE
3641-6870-0050 THAT IT COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE THAN DISPLEASE ME GREATLY BECAUSE IT WAS AN INSULT TO ME
3641-6870-0051 SHE THOUGHT VERY LIKELY THAT YOU STILL LOVED ME AND SHE IMAGINED FOR I KNOW HER WELL THAT SHE COULD NOT GIVE US A GREATER PROOF OF HER LOVE THAN BY PROCURING US WITHOUT FOREWARNING US THAT WHICH TWO LOVERS FOND OF EACH OTHER MUST WISH FOR SO ARDENTLY
3641-6870-0052 SHE WISHED TO MAKE US HAPPY AND I CANNOT BE ANGRY WITH HER FOR IT YOU ARE RIGHT TO THINK SO DEAREST BUT MY POSITION IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM YOURS YOU HAVE NOT ANOTHER LOVER YOU COULD NOT HAVE ANOTHER BUT I BEING FREE AND UNABLE TO SEE YOU
3641-6870-0053 HAVE NOT FOUND IT POSSIBLE TO RESIST THE CHARMS OF M M I LOVE HER MADLY SHE KNOWS IT AND INTELLIGENT AS SHE IS SHE MUST HAVE MEANT TO SHEW HER CONTEMPT FOR ME BY DOING WHAT SHE HAS DONE I CANDIDLY CONFESS THAT I FEEL HURT IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE
3641-6870-0054 IF SHE LOVED ME AS I LOVE HER SHE NEVER COULD HAVE SENT YOU HERE INSTEAD OF COMING HERSELF I DO NOT THINK SO MY BELOVED FRIEND HER SOUL IS AS NOBLE AS HER HEART IS GENEROUS
3641-6870-0055 AND JUST IN THE SAME MANNER THAT I AM NOT SORRY TO KNOW THAT YOU LOVE ONE ANOTHER AND THAT YOU MAKE EACH OTHER HAPPY AS THIS BEAUTIFUL CASINO PROVES TO ME SHE DOES NOT REGRET OUR LOVE AND SHE IS ON THE CONTRARY DELIGHTED TO SHEW US THAT SHE APPROVES OF IT
3641-6870-0056 MOST LIKELY SHE MEANT TO PROVE THAT SHE LOVED YOU FOR YOUR OWN SAKE THAT YOUR HAPPINESS MAKES HER HAPPY AND THAT SHE IS NOT JEALOUS OF HER BEST FRIEND BEING HER RIVAL TO CONVINCE YOU THAT YOU OUGHT NOT TO BE ANGRY WITH HER FOR HAVING DISCOVERED OUR SECRET
3641-6870-0057 SHE PROVES BY SENDING ME HERE IN HER PLACE THAT SHE IS PLEASED TO SEE YOUR HEART DIVIDED BETWEEN HER AND ME YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT SHE LOVES ME AND THAT I AM OFTEN EITHER HER WIFE OR HER HUSBAND
3641-6870-0058 AND AS YOU DO NOT OBJECT TO MY BEING YOUR RIVAL AND MAKING HER OFTEN AS HAPPY AS I CAN SHE DOES NOT WANT YOU EITHER TO SUPPOSE THAT HER LOVE IS LIKE HATRED FOR THE LOVE OF A JEALOUS HEART IS VERY MUCH LIKE IT
3641-6870-0059 YOU PLEAD THE CAUSE OF YOUR FRIEND WITH THE ELOQUENCE OF AN ANGEL BUT DEAR LITTLE WIFE YOU DO NOT SEE THE AFFAIR IN ITS PROPER LIGHT YOU HAVE INTELLIGENCE AND A PURE SOUL BUT YOU HAVE NOT MY EXPERIENCE
3641-6870-0060 AS TO BE DECEIVED BY ALL THIS AFFAIR I AM MISERABLE AND IT IS HER DOING THEN I SHOULD BE RIGHT IF I COMPLAINED OF HER ALSO BECAUSE SHE MAKES ME FEEL THAT SHE IS THE MISTRESS OF MY LOVER AND SHE SHEWS ME THAT AFTER SEDUCING HIM FROM ME
3641-6870-0061 SHE GIVES HIM BACK TO ME WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THEN SHE WISHES ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE DESPISES ALSO MY TENDER AFFECTION FOR HER SINCE SHE PLACES ME IN A POSITION TO SHEW THAT AFFECTION FOR ANOTHER PERSON
3641-6870-0062 NOW DEAREST YOU SPEAK WITHOUT REASON FOR THE RELATIONS BETWEEN YOU TWO ARE OF AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT NATURE YOUR MUTUAL LOVE IS NOTHING BUT TRIFLING NONSENSE MERE ILLUSION OF THE SENSES THE PLEASURES WHICH YOU ENJOY TOGETHER ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE
3641-6870-0063 TO BECOME JEALOUS OF ONE ANOTHER IT WOULD BE NECESSARY THAT ONE OF YOU TWO SHOULD FEEL A SIMILAR AFFECTION FOR ANOTHER WOMAN BUT M M COULD NO MORE BE ANGRY AT YOUR HAVING A LOVER THAN YOU COULD BE SO YOURSELF IF SHE HAD ONE PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT THE LOVER SHOULD NOT BELONG TO THE OTHER
3641-6870-0064 BUT THAT IS PRECISELY OUR CASE AND YOU ARE MISTAKEN WE ARE NOT ANGRY AT YOUR LOVING US BOTH EQUALLY HAVE I NOT WRITTEN TO YOU THAT I WOULD MOST WILLINGLY GIVE YOU MY PLACE NEAR M M THEN YOU MUST BELIEVE THAT I DESPISE YOU LIKEWISE MY DARLING
3641-6870-0065 THAT WISH OF YOURS TO GIVE ME UP YOUR PLACE WHEN YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT I WAS HAPPY WITH M M AROSE FROM YOUR FRIENDSHIP RATHER THAN FROM YOUR LOVE AND FOR THE PRESENT I MUST BE GLAD TO SEE THAT YOUR FRIENDSHIP IS STRONGER THAN YOUR LOVE
3641-6870-0066 BUT I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE SORRY WHEN M M FEELS THE SAME I LOVE HER WITHOUT ANY POSSIBILITY OF MARRYING HER DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME DEAREST AS FOR YOU KNOWING THAT YOU MUST BE MY WIFE I AM CERTAIN OF OUR LOVE WHICH PRACTICE WILL ANIMATE WITH NEW LIFE
3641-6870-0067 IT IS NOT THE SAME WITH M M THAT LOVE CANNOT SPRING UP AGAIN INTO EXISTENCE IS IT NOT HUMILIATING FOR ME TO HAVE INSPIRED HER WITH NOTHING BUT A PASSING FANCY I UNDERSTAND YOUR ADORATION FOR HER VERY WELL
3641-6870-0068 SHE HAS INITIATED YOU INTO ALL HER MYSTERIES AND YOU OWE HER ETERNAL FRIENDSHIP AND EVERLASTING GRATITUDE IT WAS MIDNIGHT AND WE WENT ON WASTING OUR TIME IN THIS DESULTORY CONVERSATION WHEN THE PRUDENT AND CAREFUL SERVANT BROUGHT US AN EXCELLENT SUPPER
3641-6870-0069 I COULD NOT TOUCH ANYTHING MY HEART WAS TOO FULL BUT MY DEAR LITTLE WIFE SUPPED WITH A GOOD APPETITE I COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING WHEN I SAW A SALAD OF WHITES OF EGGS AND C C THOUGHT IT EXTRAORDINARY BECAUSE ALL THE YOLKS HAD BEEN REMOVED
3641-6870-0070 IN HER INNOCENCE SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE INTENTION OF THE PERSON WHO HAD ORDERED THE SUPPER AS I LOOKED AT HER I WAS COMPELLED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SHE HAD IMPROVED IN BEAUTY IN FACT C C WAS REMARKABLY BEAUTIFUL YET I REMAINED COLD BY HER SIDE
3641-6870-0071 I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THERE IS NO MERIT IN BEING FAITHFUL TO THE PERSON WE TRULY LOVE TWO HOURS BEFORE DAY LIGHT WE RESUMED OUR SEATS NEAR THE FIRE AND C C SEEING HOW DULL I WAS WAS DELICATELY ATTENTIVE TO ME SHE ATTEMPTED NO ALLUREMENT
3641-6870-0072 ALL HER MOVEMENTS WORE THE STAMP OF THE MOST DECENT RESERVE AND HER CONVERSATION TENDER IN ITS EXPRESSIONS AND PERFECTLY EASY NEVER CONVEYED THE SHADOW OF A REPROACH FOR MY COOLNESS
3641-6870-0073 TOWARDS THE END OF OUR LONG CONVERSATION SHE ASKED ME WHAT SHE SHOULD SAY TO HER FRIEND ON HER RETURN TO THE CONVENT MY DEAR M M EXPECTS TO SEE ME FULL OF JOY AND GRATITUDE FOR THE GENEROUS PRESENT SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS MAKING ME BY GIVING ME THIS NIGHT
3641-6870-0074 BUT WHAT SHALL I TELL HER THE WHOLE TRUTH DO NOT KEEP FROM HER A SINGLE WORD OF OUR CONVERSATION AS FAR AS YOUR MEMORY WILL SERVE YOU AND TELL HER ESPECIALLY THAT SHE HAS MADE ME MISERABLE FOR A LONG TIME
3641-6870-0075 NO FOR I SHOULD CAUSE HER TOO GREAT A SORROW SHE LOVES YOU DEARLY AND CHERISHES THE LOCKET WHICH CONTAINS YOUR LIKENESS
3641-6870-0076 I MEAN ON THE CONTRARY TO DO ALL I CAN TO BRING PEACE BETWEEN YOU TWO AND I MUST SUCCEED BEFORE LONG BECAUSE MY FRIEND IS NOT GUILTY OF ANY WRONG AND YOU ONLY FEEL SOME SPITE ALTHOUGH WITH NO CAUSE
3641-6870-0077 I WILL SEND YOU MY LETTER BY LAURA UNLESS YOU PROMISE ME TO GO AND FETCH IT YOURSELF AT HER HOUSE YOUR LETTERS WILL ALWAYS BE DEAR TO ME BUT MARK MY WORDS M M WILL NOT ENTER INTO ANY EXPLANATION SHE WILL BELIEVE YOU IN EVERYTHING EXCEPT IN ONE
3641-6870-0078 I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN OUR PASSING A WHOLE NIGHT TOGETHER AS INNOCENTLY AS IF WE WERE BROTHER AND SISTER IF SHE KNOWS YOU AS WELL AS I DO SHE WILL INDEED THINK IT MOST WONDERFUL IN THAT CASE YOU MAY TELL HER THE CONTRARY IF YOU LIKE
3641-6870-0079 NOTHING OF THE SORT I HATE FALSEHOODS AND I WILL CERTAINLY NEVER UTTER ONE IN SUCH A CASE AS THIS IT WOULD BE VERY WRONG I DO NOT LOVE YOU LESS ON THAT ACCOUNT MY DARLING ALTHOUGH DURING THIS LONG NIGHT YOU HAVE NOT CONDESCENDED TO GIVE ME THE SLIGHTEST PROOF OF YOUR LOVE
3641-6870-0080 BELIEVE ME DEAREST I AM SICK FROM UNHAPPINESS I LOVE YOU WITH MY WHOLE SOUL BUT I AM IN SUCH A SITUATION THAT WHAT YOU ARE WEEPING MY LOVE OH I ENTREAT YOU SPARE MY HEART I AM SO SORRY TO HAVE TOLD YOU SUCH A THING
3641-6870-0081 BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU I NEVER MEANT TO MAKE YOU UNHAPPY I AM SURE THAT IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR M M WILL BE CRYING LIKEWISE THE ALARUM STRUCK AND HAVING NO LONGER ANY HOPE OF SEEING M M COME TO JUSTIFY HERSELF I KISSED C C
