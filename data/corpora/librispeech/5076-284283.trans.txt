5076-284283-0013 LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD SAID YOU HAVE HAD MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVE THAT YOU WOULD LIVE IN PEACE ON THE RESERVATION THERE WILL NOT BE ANOTHER CHANCE GENERAL MILES ORDERS STAND ACCEPT IMPRISONMENT
5076-284283-0014 IN FLORIDA OR BE KILLED BY SOLDIERS WE MAY ALSO KILL SOLDIERS GERONIMO REMINDED HIM THAT YOU HAVE PROVEN MANY TIMES LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD ADMITTED BUT YOU REMEMBER THE TIMES OF LONG AGO
5076-284283-0015 WHEN FOR EVERY WHITE MAN IN ARIZONA THERE WERE A HUNDRED APACHES NOW FOR EVERY APACHE THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED WHITE MEN AND MORE TO COME YOU CANNOT KILL ALL THE SOLDIERS NOR CAN THEY KILL US
5076-284283-0016 GERONIMO SAID MY TERMS STAND WE RETURN TO THE WHITE MOUNTAINS AND LIVE AS WE ONCE LIVED OR WE CONTINUE THE WAR LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD
5076-284283-0017 I SAW YOUR MOTHER AND DAUGHTER
5076-284283-0018 THEY HAVE BEEN SENT TO FLORIDA WITH THE REST BUT BOTH INQUIRED ABOUT YOU
5076-284283-0019 EAGERLY VERY WELL LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD SAID THEY WISH YOU TO SURRENDER SO THAT YOU MAY JOIN THEM AND I AM TO REMIND YOU THAT AN ENEMY MORE MERCILESS THAN ANY SOLDIERS LIES IN WAIT
5076-284283-0020 IT IS WINTER THAT IS JUST AHEAD GERONIMO DO I HAVE YOUR FINAL ANSWER GERONIMO SAID MAY WE TALK AGAIN TOMORROW WE MAY SAID LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD THEY PARTED
5076-284283-0021 LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD AND HIS PARTY RETURNED TO THEIR CAMP WHILE THE APACHES WENT TO THEIRS THE INDIANS WERE SOBER AND THOUGHTFUL IT IS TRUE GERONIMO SAID
5076-284283-0022 WE HAVE FOUGHT AND FOUGHT WELL BUT WE ARE VERY FEW AND OUR ENEMIES ARE VERY MANY WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO FIGHT THEM FOREVER
5076-284283-0023 IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILIES AGAIN
5076-284283-0024 ALL WERE DESPERATELY TIRED AND LONELY THEY HAD ENDURED FAR MORE THAN FLESH AND BLOOD SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO BEAR BUT THEY WERE WILLING TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT
5076-284283-0025 I FEAR TO SURRENDER EVEN MORE THAN I FEAR TO CONTINUE THE BATTLE MEXICANS SOUTH OF THE BORDER AND AMERICANS NORTH OF IT WOULD KILL US AS READILY AS WE WOULD KILL A PACK OF RABID WOLVES
5076-284283-0026 IF WE HAND OUR ARMS OVER TO LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD WHO WILL PROTECT US UNTIL WE ARE SAFE IN FLORIDA SUDDENLY GERONIMO WHO HAD BEEN SILENT
5076-284283-0027 THERE WAS OLD MANGUS COLORADUS ADVISING HIS PEOPLE TO MAKE PEACE WITH THE WHITE MEN SINCE THEY COULD NEVER HOPE TO CONQUER THEM
5076-284283-0028 TO TEACH HIM WHAT MANGUS COLORADUS HAD BEEN TAUGHT BY HIS OWN WISDOM NOW ALMOST TWENTY FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DEATH OF MANGUS COLORADUS GERONIMO FINALLY UNDERSTOOD
5076-284283-0029 WHAT ONE OF THESE CHIEFS HAD KNOWN AND THE OTHER HAD LEARNED APACHES COULD NOT FIGHT THE WHITE MEN BUT NEITHER COULD THEY SURRENDER TO THEM UNLESS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO WORK OUT A PLAN
5076-284283-0030 GUARANTEEING THEIR OWN SAFETY WHEN THEY RESUMED THEIR TALKS THE NEXT DAY GERONIMO SAID BLUNTLY TO LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD FORGET YOU ARE A WHITE MAN AND PRETEND YOU ARE ONE OF US
5076-284283-0031 WHAT WOULD YOU DO TRUST GENERAL MILES AND SURRENDER TO HIM LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD SAID PROMPTLY SO YOU HAVE SPOKEN AND SO SHALL WE DO SAID GERONIMO BUT IT IS A LONG WAY TO THE BORDER
5076-284283-0032 WHERE GENERAL MILES AWAITS AND THIS IS ENEMY COUNTRY WE WILL NOT SURRENDER OUR ARMS UNTIL WE ARE MET BY GENERAL MILES THAT IS AGREEABLE SAID LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD IN ADDITION
5076-284283-0033 CAPTAIN LAWTON AND A COMPANY OF SOLDIERS ARE CAMPED NOT FAR AWAY I WILL ASK THEM TO MARCH WITH YOU AND HELP BEAT OFF ANY MEXICANS
5076-284283-0034 CAPTAIN LAWTON AND HIS SOLDIERS MAY COME BUT THEY ARE TO STAY AHEAD OR BEHIND WE DO NOT CARE TO MINGLE WITH WHITE SOLDIERS
5076-284283-0035 LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD MARCHED WITH THEM CAPTAIN LAWTON PROVIDED AN ESCORT OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS AND A MOB OF TWO HUNDRED MEXICANS WHO FINALLY SAW THE HATED APACHES IN CAPTIVITY
5076-284283-0036 TRAILED THEM ALL THE WAY BUT THE MEXICANS DID NOT DARE START A FIGHT WHEN THEY REACHED THE CAMP WHERE GENERAL MILES WAS WAITING GERONIMO STALKED HAUGHTILY TO THE GENERAL WHO STARED COLDLY
5076-284283-0037 AT THE GREAT APACHE LEADER GERONIMO AND HIS WARRIORS LAID DOWN THE ARMS THAT THEY HAD CARRIED SO MANY MILES AND INTO SO MANY BATTLES THE DISARMED APACHES WERE SURROUNDED BY SOLDIERS
5076-284283-0038 WHO TOOK THEM FIRST TO PRISON CELLS AT ARIZONA'S FORT BOWIE THEN TO THE TRAIN THAT CARRIED THEM TO EXILE IN FLORIDA
5076-284283-0039 SO ENDED THE FIGHTING DAYS OF GERONIMO THE LAST AND FIERCEST APACHE WAR CHIEF AND SO ALSO ENDED THE INDIAN WARS IN THE SOUTHWEST NEVER AGAIN WOULD MEN AND WOMEN ON LONELY RANCHES
5076-284283-0040 OR IN ISOLATED VILLAGES AWAKEN TREMBLING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO HEAR THE POUND OF PONIES HOOFS AND THE WILD APACHE WAR CRY NEVER AGAIN WOULD TRAVELERS IN ARIZONA NEW MEXICO
5076-284283-0041 AND NORTHERN MEXICO FIND IT NECESSARY TO TRAVEL IN GROUPS AND WELL ARMED FOR FEAR OF APACHE ATTACKS GERONIMO AND HIS FOLLOWERS AS WELL AS MANY OTHER
5076-284283-0042 AND WARM SPRINGS APACHES WERE IMPRISONED AT OLD FORT PICKENS OR AT FORT MARION IN FLORIDA EVENTUALLY THEY WERE MOVED TO A RESERVATION IN WHAT WAS THEN INDIAN TERRITORY
5076-284283-0043 AND WHAT IS NOW THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA THERE GERONIMO DIED AT FORT SILL ON FEBRUARY SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN O NINE WHETHER HE WAS A GREAT VILLAIN OR A GREAT PATRIOT
5076-284283-0044 DEPENDS ON WHETHER ONE LOOKS AT HIM WITH THE EYES OF THE WHITE MEN WHOM HE PLUNDERED OR THE APACHES WHOM HE CHAMPIONED
