6076-51654-0010 WHEN PENITENCE MANAGES TO LEAD THEIR FUGITIVES BACK HARSH AND IMPLACABLE MASTERS RESTRAIN THEIR CRUELTY AND WE ARE MERCIFUL TO ENEMIES WHO HAVE SURRENDERED WHAT COULD YOU ASK OR WISH FOR MORE
6076-51654-0011 THESE WELL BORN AND RESPECTABLE YOUNG MEN BE SUPPLIANT BEFORE YOUR EYES AND WHAT OUGHT TO MOVE YOU MORE STRONGLY STILL
6076-51654-0012 IF THEY HAD EMBEZZLED YOUR MONEY OR REPAID YOUR FAITH IN THEM WITH TREACHERY BY HERCULES YOU HAVE AMPLE SATISFACTION FROM THE PUNISHMENT ALREADY INFLICTED
6076-51654-0013 LOOK CAN YOU READ SLAVERY ON THEIR FOREHEADS AND SEE UPON THE FACES OF FREE MEN THE BRAND MARKS OF A PUNISHMENT WHICH WAS SELF INFLICTED LYCAS BROKE IN UPON THIS PLEA FOR MERCY
6076-51654-0014 DON'T TRY TO CONFUSE THE ISSUE HE SAID LET EVERY DETAIL HAVE ITS PROPER ATTENTION AND FIRST OF ALL

6076-51654-0016 AND INASMUCH AS THEY WERE OUR FRIENDS BY THAT THEY DESERVE MORE DRASTIC PUNISHMENT STILL FOR WHOEVER COMMITS AN ASSAULT UPON A STRANGER IS TERMED A ROBBER BUT WHOEVER ASSAULTS A FRIEND IS LITTLE BETTER THAN A PARRICIDE
6076-51654-0017 I AM WELL AWARE EUMOLPUS REPLIED TO REBUT THIS DAMNING HARANGUE THAT NOTHING CAN LOOK BLACKER AGAINST THESE POOR YOUNG MEN THAN THEIR CUTTING OFF THEIR HAIR AT NIGHT
6076-51654-0018 NOR COULD I FIND ANYTHING TO SAY OUT OF COUNTENANCE AS I WAS AND HIDEOUS FOR TO THE DISGRACE OF A SHAVEN POLL WAS ADDED AN EQUAL BALDNESS IN THE MATTER OF EYEBROWS THE CASE AGAINST ME WAS ONLY TOO PLAIN
6076-51654-0019 THERE WAS NOT A THING TO BE SAID OR DONE FINALLY A DAMP SPONGE WAS PASSED OVER MY TEAR WET FACE AND THEREUPON THE SMUT DISSOLVED AND SPREAD OVER MY WHOLE COUNTENANCE BLOTTING OUT EVERY FEATURE IN A SOOTY CLOUD ANGER TURNED INTO LOATHING
6076-51654-0020 WHOSE PARTICIPATION SERVED RATHER TO INFLAME THE DISAGREEMENT THAN TO BE OF HELP TO US FOR MYSELF I ASKED NO QUARTER
6076-51654-0021 BUT I SHOOK MY FISTS IN TRYPHAENA'S FACE AND TOLD HER IN A LOUD VOICE THAT UNLESS SHE STOPPED HURTING GITON I WOULD USE EVERY OUNCE OF MY STRENGTH AGAINST HER REPROBATE WOMAN THAT SHE WAS THE ONLY PERSON ABOARD THE SHIP WHO DESERVED A FLOGGING
6076-51654-0022 LYCAS WAS FURIOUSLY ANGRY AT MY HARDIHOOD NOR WAS HE LESS ENRAGED AT MY ABANDONING MY OWN CAUSE TO TAKE UP THAT OF ANOTHER IN SO WHOLEHEARTED A MANNER INFLAMED AS SHE WAS BY THIS AFFRONT TRYPHAENA WAS AS FURIOUS AS HE
6076-51654-0023 SO THE WHOLE SHIP'S COMPANY WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO FACTIONS ON OUR SIDE THE HIRED BARBER ARMED HIMSELF WITH A RAZOR AND SERVED OUT THE OTHERS TO US
6076-51654-0024 THE PILOT WAS NEUTRAL BUT HE DECLARED THAT UNLESS THIS MADNESS STIRRED UP BY THE LECHERY OF A COUPLE OF VAGABONDS DIED DOWN HE WOULD LET GO THE HELM THE FURY OF THE COMBATANTS CONTINUED TO RAGE NONE THE LESS FIERCELY
6076-51654-0025 NEVERTHELESS THEY FIGHTING FOR REVENGE WE FOR LIFE MANY FELL ON EACH SIDE THOUGH NONE WERE MORTALLY WOUNDED AND MORE BLEEDING FROM WOUNDS RETREATED AS FROM A REAL BATTLE BUT THE FURY OF NEITHER SIDE ABATED
6076-51654-0026 AT LAST THE GALLANT GITON TURNED THE MENACING RAZOR AGAINST HIS OWN VIRILE PARTS AND THREATENED TO CUT AWAY THE CAUSE OF SO MANY MISFORTUNES THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR TRYPHAENA SHE PREVENTED THE PERPETRATION OF SO HORRID A CRIME BY THE OUT AND OUT PROMISE OF QUARTER
6076-51654-0027 WHICH HE HAD ALREADY CUT HIS THROAT THE LINES STILL STOOD AT THE READY
6076-51654-0028 BUT PASSION SCORNED BECOMES A POWER ALAS WHO COURTS HIS END BY DRAWING SWORD AMIDST THESE WAVES WHY DIE BEFORE OUR TIME

6076-51654-0033 THE TREATY WAS SIGNED UPON THESE TERMS AND WE LAID DOWN OUR ARMS IT SEEMED WELL TO WIPE OUT THE PAST WITH KISSES AFTER WE HAD TAKEN OATH FOR FEAR ANY VESTIGE OF RANCOR SHOULD PERSIST IN OUR MINDS
6076-51654-0034 FACTIOUS HATREDS DIED OUT AMIDST UNIVERSAL GOOD FELLOWSHIP AND A BANQUET SERVED ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE CROWNED OUR RECONCILIATION WITH JOVIALITY THE WHOLE SHIP RESOUNDED WITH SONG AND AS A SUDDEN CALM HAD CAUSED HER TO LOSE HEADWAY
6076-51654-0035 ONE TRIED TO HARPOON THE LEAPING FISH ANOTHER HAULED IN THE STRUGGLING CATCH ON BAITED HOOKS
6076-51654-0036 THE BREEZE CAUGHT UP THE DOWN BUT THE WING AND TAIL FEATHERS TWISTED SPIRALLY AS THEY FELL INTO THE SEA FOAM LYCAS WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO BE ON GOOD TERMS WITH ME AND
6076-51654-0037 WHEN EUMOLPUS WHO WAS HIMSELF ALMOST DRUNK WAS SEIZED WITH THE NOTION OF SATIRIZING BALD PATES AND BRANDED RASCALS BUT WHEN HE HAD EXHAUSTED HIS CHILLY WIT

6076-51654-0041 LED GITON AWAY BELOW AND FITTED THE LAD OUT IN
6076-51654-0042 THEN PRODUCING SOME EYEBROWS FROM A VANITY BOX SHE SKILLFULLY TRACED OUT THE LINES OF THE LOST FEATURES AND RESTORED HIM TO HIS PROPER COMELINESS
6076-51654-0043 BUT IN A LITTLE WHILE EUMOLPUS MOUTHPIECE OF THE DISTRESSED AND AUTHOR OF THE PRESENT GOOD UNDERSTANDING FEARING THAT THE GENERAL GOOD HUMOR MIGHT FLAG FOR LACK OF AMUSEMENT BEGAN TO INDULGE IN SNEERS AT THE FICKLENESS OF WOMEN
6076-51654-0044 HOW EASILY THEY FELL IN LOVE HOW READILY THEY FORGOT EVEN THEIR OWN SONS NO WOMAN COULD BE SO CHASTE BUT THAT SHE COULD BE ROUSED TO MADNESS BY A CHANCE PASSION
