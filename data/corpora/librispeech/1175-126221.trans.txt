1175-126221-0000 THE STROKE OF SCORN RELIEVED HIS MIND AND THE NEXT MORNING HE LAUGHED AT HIS SELF CONCEIT BUT THE LAUGH WAS NOT A HEALTHY ONE HE RE READ THE LETTER FROM THE MASTER AND THE WISDOM IN ITS LINES WHICH HAD AT FIRST EXASPERATED HIM
1175-126221-0001 CHILLED AND DEPRESSED HIM NOW HE SAW HIMSELF AS A FOOL INDEED DEPRIVED OF THE OBJECTS OF BOTH INTELLECT AND EMOTION HE COULD NOT PROCEED TO HIS WORK WHENEVER HE FELT RECONCILED TO HIS FATE AS A STUDENT
1175-126221-0002 THERE CAME TO DISTURB HIS CALM HIS HOPELESS RELATIONS WITH SUE THAT THE ONE AFFINED SOUL HE HAD EVER MET WAS LOST TO HIM THROUGH HIS MARRIAGE RETURNED UPON HIM WITH CRUEL PERSISTENCY TILL UNABLE TO BEAR IT LONGER
1175-126221-0003 HE AGAIN RUSHED FOR DISTRACTION TO THE REAL CHRISTMINSTER LIFE HE NOW SOUGHT IT OUT IN AN OBSCURE AND LOW CEILED TAVERN UP A COURT WHICH WAS WELL KNOWN TO CERTAIN WORTHIES OF THE PLACE
1175-126221-0004 AND IN BRIGHTER TIMES WOULD HAVE INTERESTED HIM SIMPLY BY ITS QUAINTNESS HERE HE SAT MORE OR LESS ALL THE DAY CONVINCED THAT HE WAS AT BOTTOM A VICIOUS CHARACTER OF WHOM IT WAS HOPELESS TO EXPECT ANYTHING
1175-126221-0005 IN THE EVENING THE FREQUENTERS OF THE HOUSE DROPPED IN ONE BY ONE JUDE STILL RETAINING HIS SEAT IN THE CORNER THOUGH HIS MONEY WAS ALL SPENT AND HE HAD NOT EATEN ANYTHING THE WHOLE DAY EXCEPT A BISCUIT

1175-126221-0010 THE CONVERSATION WAXED GENERAL CHRISTMINSTER SOCIETY WAS CRITICIZED THE DONS MAGISTRATES AND OTHER PEOPLE IN AUTHORITY BEING SINCERELY PITIED FOR THEIR SHORTCOMINGS WHILE OPINIONS ON HOW THEY OUGHT TO CONDUCT THEMSELVES AND THEIR AFFAIRS TO BE PROPERLY RESPECTED
1175-126221-0011 AND HIS AIMS HAVING BEEN WHAT THEY WERE FOR SO MANY YEARS EVERYTHING THE OTHERS SAID TURNED UPON HIS TONGUE BY A SORT OF MECHANICAL CRAZE TO THE SUBJECT OF SCHOLARSHIP AND STUDY
1175-126221-0012 THE EXTENT OF HIS OWN LEARNING BEING DWELT UPON WITH AN INSISTENCE THAT WOULD HAVE APPEARED PITIABLE TO HIMSELF IN HIS SANE HOURS I DON'T CARE A DAMN HE WAS SAYING FOR ANY PROVOST WARDEN PRINCIPAL FELLOW OR CURSED MASTER OF ARTS IN THE UNIVERSITY
1175-126221-0013 CANST SAY THE CREED IN LATIN MAN THAT WAS HOW THEY ONCE PUT IT TO A CHAP DOWN IN MY COUNTRY I SHOULD THINK SO SAID JUDE HAUGHTILY NOT HE LIKE HIS CONCEIT SCREAMED ONE OF THE LADIES

1175-126221-0015 WELL COME NOW STAND ME A SMALL SCOTCH COLD AND I'LL DO IT STRAIGHT OFF THAT'S A FAIR OFFER SAID THE UNDERGRADUATE THROWING DOWN THE MONEY FOR THE WHISKY THE BARMAID CONCOCTED THE MIXTURE WITH THE BEARING OF A PERSON COMPELLED TO LIVE AMONGST ANIMALS OF AN INFERIOR SPECIES
1175-126221-0016 VISIBILIUM OMNIUM ET INVISIBILIUM
1175-126221-0017 A SILENCE REIGNED AMONG THE REST IN THE BAR AND THE MAID STOOD STILL JUDE'S VOICE ECHOING SONOROUSLY INTO THE INNER PARLOUR WHERE THE LANDLORD WAS DOZING AND BRINGING HIM OUT TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON JUDE HAD DECLAIMED STEADILY AHEAD AND WAS CONTINUING
1175-126221-0018 CRUCIFIXUS ETIAM PRO NOBIS SUB PONTIO PILATO PASSUS
1175-126221-0019 LET UN GO ON LET UN GO ON SAID THE AUCTIONEER BUT JUDE'S MIND SEEMED TO GROW CONFUSED SOON AND HE COULD NOT GET ON HE PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FOREHEAD AND HIS FACE ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF PAIN
1175-126221-0020 GIVE HIM ANOTHER GLASS THEN HE'LL FETCH UP AND GET THROUGH IT SAID TINKER TAYLOR SOMEBODY THREW DOWN THREEPENCE THE GLASS WAS HANDED JUDE STRETCHED OUT HIS ARM FOR IT WITHOUT LOOKING AND HAVING SWALLOWED THE LIQUOR
1175-126221-0021 WENT ON IN A MOMENT IN A REVIVED VOICE RAISING IT AS HE NEARED THE END WITH THE MANNER OF A PRIEST LEADING A CONGREGATION ET IN SPIRITUM SANCTUM DOMINUM ET VIVIFICANTEM
1175-126221-0022 ET UNAM CATHOLICAM ET APOSTOLICAM ECCLESIAM
1175-126221-0023 THEN JUDE SEEMED TO SHAKE THE FUMES FROM HIS BRAIN AS HE STARED ROUND UPON THEM YOU PACK OF FOOLS HE CRIED WHICH ONE OF YOU KNOWS WHETHER I HAVE SAID IT OR NO IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE RATCATCHER'S DAUGHTER IN DOUBLE DUTCH FOR ALL THAT YOUR BESOTTED HEADS CAN TELL
1175-126221-0024 THE LANDLORD WHO HAD ALREADY HAD HIS LICENSE ENDORSED FOR HARBOURING QUEER CHARACTERS FEARED A RIOT AND CAME OUTSIDE THE COUNTER BUT JUDE IN HIS SUDDEN FLASH OF REASON HAD TURNED IN DISGUST AND LEFT THE SCENE
1175-126221-0025 ONWARD HE STILL WENT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A CHILDLIKE YEARNING FOR THE ONE BEING IN THE WORLD TO WHOM IT SEEMED POSSIBLE TO FLY AN UNREASONING DESIRE WHOSE ILL JUDGEMENT WAS NOT APPARENT TO HIM NOW IN THE COURSE OF AN HOUR
1175-126221-0026 WHEN IT WAS BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN O'CLOCK HE ENTERED THE VILLAGE OF LUMSDON AND REACHING THE COTTAGE SAW THAT A LIGHT WAS BURNING IN A DOWNSTAIRS ROOM WHICH HE ASSUMED RIGHTLY AS IT HAPPENED TO BE HERS
1175-126221-0027 JUDE STEPPED CLOSE TO THE WALL AND TAPPED WITH HIS FINGER ON THE PANE SAYING IMPATIENTLY SUE SUE
1175-126221-0028 AND IN A SECOND OR TWO THE DOOR WAS UNLOCKED AND OPENED AND SUE APPEARED WITH A CANDLE IN HER HAND IS IT JUDE YES IT IS MY DEAR DEAR COUSIN WHAT'S THE MATTER OH I AM
1175-126221-0029 AND THE OTHER SUPPORTING HIM SHE LED HIM INDOORS AND PLACED HIM IN THE ONLY EASY CHAIR THE MEAGRELY FURNISHED HOUSE AFFORDED STRETCHING HIS FEET UPON ANOTHER AND PULLING OFF HIS BOOTS JUDE NOW GETTING TOWARDS HIS SOBER SENSES COULD ONLY SAY DEAR DEAR SUE
1175-126221-0030 IN A VOICE BROKEN BY GRIEF AND CONTRITION SHE ASKED HIM IF HE WANTED ANYTHING TO EAT BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD THEN TELLING HIM TO GO TO SLEEP AND THAT SHE WOULD COME DOWN EARLY IN THE MORNING AND GET HIM SOME BREAKFAST SHE BADE HIM GOOD NIGHT
1175-126221-0031 AND ASCENDED THE STAIRS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY HE FELL INTO A HEAVY SLUMBER AND DID NOT WAKE TILL DAWN
1175-126221-0032 AND HE BEHELD IT IN ALL THE GHASTLINESS OF A RIGHT MIND SHE KNEW THE WORST OF HIM THE VERY WORST HOW COULD HE FACE HER NOW SHE WOULD SOON BE COMING DOWN TO SEE ABOUT BREAKFAST AS SHE HAD SAID
1175-126221-0033 AND THERE WOULD HE BE IN ALL HIS SHAME CONFRONTING HER HE COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT AND SOFTLY DRAWING ON HIS BOOTS AND TAKING HIS HAT FROM THE NAIL ON WHICH SHE HAD HUNG IT HE SLIPPED NOISELESSLY OUT OF THE HOUSE
1175-126221-0034 HIS SMALL SAVINGS DEPOSITED AT ONE OF THE BANKS IN CHRISTMINSTER HAVING FORTUNATELY BEEN LEFT UNTOUCHED TO GET TO MARYGREEN THEREFORE HIS ONLY COURSE WAS WALKING AND THE DISTANCE BEING NEARLY TWENTY MILES
1175-126221-0035 HE HAD AMPLE TIME TO COMPLETE ON THE WAY THE SOBERING PROCESS BEGUN IN HIM AT SOME HOUR OF THE EVENING HE REACHED ALFREDSTON HERE HE PAWNED HIS WAISTCOAT AND HAVING GONE OUT OF THE TOWN A MILE OR TWO SLEPT UNDER A RICK THAT NIGHT
1175-126221-0036 WEARY AND MUD BESPATTERED BUT QUITE POSSESSED OF HIS ORDINARY CLEARNESS OF BRAIN HE SAT DOWN BY THE WELL THINKING AS HE DID SO WHAT A POOR CHRIST HE MADE SEEING A TROUGH OF WATER NEAR HE BATHED HIS FACE AND WENT ON TO THE COTTAGE OF HIS GREAT AUNT
1175-126221-0037 WHOM HE FOUND BREAKFASTING IN BED ATTENDED BY THE WOMAN WHO LIVED WITH HER WHAT OUT O WORK ASKED HIS RELATIVE REGARDING HIM THROUGH EYES SUNKEN DEEP UNDER LIDS HEAVY AS POT COVERS
1175-126221-0038 YES SAID JUDE HEAVILY I THINK I MUST HAVE A LITTLE REST REFRESHED BY SOME BREAKFAST HE WENT UP TO HIS OLD ROOM AND LAY DOWN IN HIS SHIRT SLEEVES AFTER THE MANNER OF THE ARTIZAN
1175-126221-0039 IT WAS HELL THE HELL OF CONSCIOUS FAILURE BOTH IN AMBITION AND IN LOVE
1175-126221-0040 IF HE HAD BEEN A WOMAN HE MUST HAVE SCREAMED UNDER THE NERVOUS TENSION WHICH HE WAS NOW UNDERGOING BUT THAT RELIEF BEING DENIED TO HIS VIRILITY HE CLENCHED HIS TEETH IN MISERY BRINGING LINES ABOUT HIS MOUTH LIKE THOSE IN THE LAOCOON
1175-126221-0041 NOW ABANDONED PECKED ITS NEIGHBOUR SMARTLY AND THE VANE ON THE NEW VICTORIAN GOTHIC CHURCH IN THE NEW SPOT HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO CREAK
1175-126221-0042 IT WAS A VOICE HE GUESSED ITS ORIGIN IN A MOMENT OR TWO THE CURATE WAS PRAYING WITH HIS AUNT IN THE ADJOINING ROOM HE REMEMBERED HER SPEAKING OF HIM PRESENTLY THE SOUNDS CEASED AND A STEP SEEMED TO CROSS THE LANDING
1175-126221-0043 AND MORE UPON THE THEOLOGICAL THOUGH THIS HAD UP TILL NOW BEEN MERELY A PORTION OF THE GENERAL PLAN OF ADVANCEMENT NOW I KNOW I HAVE BEEN A FOOL AND THAT FOLLY IS WITH ME ADDED JUDE IN CONCLUSION AND I DON'T REGRET THE COLLAPSE OF MY UNIVERSITY HOPES ONE JOT
1175-126221-0044 I WOULDN'T BEGIN AGAIN IF I WERE SURE TO SUCCEED I DON'T CARE FOR SOCIAL SUCCESS ANY MORE AT ALL BUT I DO FEEL I SHOULD LIKE TO DO SOME GOOD THING AND I BITTERLY REGRET THE CHURCH AND THE LOSS OF MY CHANCE OF BEING HER ORDAINED MINISTER
1175-126221-0045 FOR IT IS THAT OF A THOUGHTFUL AND EDUCATED MAN YOU MIGHT ENTER THE CHURCH AS A LICENTIATE ONLY YOU MUST MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO AVOID STRONG DRINK I COULD AVOID THAT EASILY ENOUGH
