4576-66268-0000 AND UP TO THE TABLE AND STOOD LEANING ON IT WITH ONE HAND HIS BREAST HEAVING WITH HIS LAST SWIFT RUN THEN HE SPAKE PRESENTLY I AM GISLI OF THE SHIELDINGS
4576-66268-0001 OTTER SENDETH ME TO THE HALL SUN BUT ON THE WAY
4576-66268-0002 OR BY LADS A HORSEBACK BOTH WEST AND EAST OF THE WATER LET HER SEND THE WORD AS IT SEEMETH TO HER WHETHER SHE HATH SEEN IT OR NOT
4576-66268-0003 IS OVER THEN A DAMSEL BROUGHT HIM A HORN OF MEAD AND LET IT COME INTO HIS HAND AND HE DRANK SIGHING WITH PLEASURE WHILE THE DAMSEL FOR PLEASURE OF HIM AND HIS TIDINGS LAID HER HAND ON HIS SHOULDER THEN HE SET DOWN THE HORN AND SPAKE
4576-66268-0004 WE WERE ALL AFOOT FOR THERE IS NO WIDE WAY THROUGH THE WOOD NOR WOULD WE HAVE IT OTHERWISE LEST THE FOE FIND THE THICKET EASY BUT MANY OF US KNOW THE THICKET AND ITS WAYS SO WE MADE NOT THE EASY HARD
4576-66268-0005 AS HE SAID THAT WORD THE CARLINE WHO HAD DRAWN VERY NEAR TO HIM AND WAS LOOKING HARD AT HIS FACE TURNED AND LOOKED ON THE HALL SUN AND STARED AT HER TILL SHE REDDENED UNDER THOSE KEEN EYES
4576-66268-0006 YET BY HIS SIDE WAS HIS MIGHTY SWORD AND WE ALL KNEW IT FOR THRONG PLOUGH AND WERE GLAD OF IT AND OF HIM AND THE UNFENCED BREAST OF THE DAUNTLESS SIX HOURS WE WENT SPREADING WIDE THROUGH THE THICKET
4576-66268-0007 AND WE SAW NOUGHT SAVE HERE AND THERE A ROE AND HERE AND THERE A SOUNDER OF SWINE AND CONEYS WHERE IT WAS OPENER AND THE SUN SHONE AND THE GRASS GREW FOR A LITTLE SPACE
4576-66268-0008 SO CAME WE UNTO WHERE THE THICKET ENDED SUDDENLY AND THERE WAS A LONG GLADE OF THE WILD WOOD ALL SET ABOUT WITH GREAT OAK TREES AND GRASS THEREUNDER WHICH I KNEW WELL
4576-66268-0009 AND THEREOF THE TALE TELLS THAT IT WAS A HOLY PLACE OF THE FOLK WHO ABIDED IN THESE PARTS BEFORE THE SONS OF THE GOTHS
4576-66268-0010 SO HE DRANK OF THE HORN AND SAID IT SEEMETH THAT FOX HAD A DEEMING OF THE WAY THE ROMANS SHOULD COME SO NOW WE ABIDED IN THE THICKET WITHOUT THAT GLADE AND LAY QUIET AND HIDDEN
4576-66268-0011 SPREADING OURSELVES AS MUCH ABOUT THAT LAWN OF THE OAK TREES AS WE MIGHT THE WHILE FOX AND THREE OTHERS
4576-66268-0012 NOT LONG HAD THEY BEEN GONE ERE WE HEARD A WAR HORN BLOW AND IT WAS NONE OF OUR HORNS IT WAS A LONG WAY OFF BUT WE LOOKED TO OUR WEAPONS FOR MEN ARE EAGER FOR THE FOE AND THE DEATH THAT COMETH WHEN THEY LIE HIDDEN IN THE THICKET
4576-66268-0013 A WHILE PASSED AND AGAIN WE HEARD THE HORN AND IT WAS NIGHER AND HAD A MARVELLOUS VOICE THEN IN A WHILE WAS A LITTLE NOISE OF MEN NOT THEIR VOICES BUT FOOTSTEPS GOING WARILY
4576-66268-0014 THROUGH THE BRAKE TO THE SOUTH AND TWELVE MEN CAME SLOWLY AND WARILY INTO THAT OAK LAWN AND LO ONE OF THEM WAS FOX
4576-66268-0015 AND FOX GOING BETWEEN THEM AS THOUGH HE SHOULD BE SLAIN IF HE MISLED THEM AND HE AND THE EIGHT ABIDED THERE WISELY AND WARILY STANDING SILENTLY SOME SIX FEET FROM EACH OTHER MOVING SCARCE AT ALL
4576-66268-0016 BUT LOOKING LIKE IMAGES FASHIONED OF BROWN COPPER AND IRON HOLDING THEIR CASTING SPEARS WHICH BE MARVELLOUS HEAVY WEAPONS AND GIRT WITH THE SAX AS THEY STOOD THERE
4576-66268-0017 NOT OUT OF EARSHOT OF A MAN SPEAKING IN HIS WONTED VOICE OUR WAR DUKE MADE A SIGN TO THOSE ABOUT HIM AND WE SPREAD VERY QUIETLY TO THE RIGHT HAND AND THE LEFT OF HIM ONCE MORE AND WE DREW AS CLOSE AS MIGHT BE TO THE THICKET'S EDGE
4576-66268-0018 MAIDENS IT WERE WELL THAT YE GAVE ME TO DRINK AGAIN FOR I AM WEARY AND MY JOURNEY IS DONE SO AGAIN THEY BROUGHT HIM THE HORN AND MADE MUCH OF HIM AND HE DRANK AND THEN SPAKE ON NOW HEARD WE THE HORN'S VOICE AGAIN QUITE CLOSE
4576-66268-0019 AND IT WAS SHARP AND SHRILL AND NOTHING LIKE TO THE ROAR OF OUR BATTLE HORNS STILL WAS THE WOOD AND NO WIND ABROAD NOT EVEN DOWN THE OAK LAWN AND WE HEARD NOW THE TRAMP OF MANY MEN AS THEY THRASHED THROUGH THE SMALL WOOD
4576-66268-0020 AND BRACKEN OF THE THICKET WAY AND THOSE EIGHT MEN AND THEIR LEADER CAME FORWARD MOVING LIKE ONE CLOSE UP TO THE THICKET WHERE I LAY JUST WHERE THE PATH PASSED INTO THE THICKET BESET BY THE SONS OF THE GOTHS SO NEAR THEY WERE
4576-66268-0021 THAT I COULD SEE THE DINTS UPON THEIR ARMOUR AND THE STRANDS OF THE WIRE ON THEIR SAX HANDLES DOWN THEN BOWED THE TALL BRACKEN ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF THE WOOD LAWN THE THICKET CRASHED BEFORE THE MARCH OF MEN AND ON THEY STRODE INTO THE LAWN
4576-66268-0022 A GOODLY BAND WARY ALERT AND SILENT OF CRIES BUT WHEN THEY CAME INTO THE LAWN THEY SPREAD OUT SOMEWHAT TO THEIR LEFT HANDS THAT IS TO SAY ON THE WEST SIDE FOR THAT WAY WAS THE CLEAR GLADE
4576-66268-0023 BUT ON THE EAST THE THICKET CAME CLOSE UP TO THEM AND EDGED THEM AWAY THEREIN LAY THE GOTHS THERE THEY STAYED AWHILE AND SPREAD OUT BUT A LITTLE AS MEN MARCHING NOT AS MEN FIGHTING
4576-66268-0024 AND ANOTHER UNARMED AN OLD MAN BOUND AND BLEEDING WITH THESE GOTHS HAD THE CAPTAIN SOME CONVERSE AND PRESENTLY HE CRIED OUT TWO OR THREE WORDS OF WELSH IN A LOUD VOICE AND THE NINE MEN WHO WERE AHEAD
4576-66268-0025 SHIFTED THEM SOMEWHAT AWAY FROM US TO LEAD DOWN THE GLADE WESTWARD THE PREY HAD COME INTO THE NET BUT THEY HAD TURNED THEIR FACES TOWARD THE MOUTH OF IT THEN TURNED THIODOLF SWIFTLY TO THE MAN BEHIND HIM WHO CARRIED THE WAR HORN
4576-66268-0026 AND EVERY MAN HANDLED HIS WEAPONS BUT THAT MAN UNDERSTOOD AND SET THE LITTLE END TO HIS MOUTH AND LOUD ROARED THE HORN OF THE MARKMEN AND NEITHER FRIEND NOR FOE MISDOUBTED THE TALE THEREOF THEN LEAPED EVERY MAN TO HIS FEET
4576-66268-0027 NO MAN FOREBORE TO SHOUT EACH AS HE MIGHT
4576-66268-0028 TO RIGHT AND LEFT FLASHED THRONG PLOUGH WHILE THIODOLF HIMSELF SCARCE SEEMED TO GUIDE IT MEN FELL BEFORE HIM AT ONCE AND CLOSE AT HIS HEELS POURED THE WOLFING KINDRED INTO THE GAP
4576-66268-0029 AND IN A MINUTE OF TIME WAS HE AMIDST OF THE THRONG AND FACE TO FACE WITH THE GOLD DIGHT CAPTAIN WHAT WITH THE SWEEP OF THRONG PLOUGH AND THE WOLFING ONRUSH THERE WAS SPACE ABOUT HIM FOR A GREAT STROKE HE GAVE A SIDE LONG STROKE TO HIS RIGHT
4576-66268-0030 ALL THE FOUR KINDREDS WERE ON THEM NOW AND AMIDST THEM AND NEEDS MUST THEY GIVE WAY BUT STOUTLY THEY FOUGHT FOR SURELY NO OTHER WARRIORS MIGHT HAVE WITHSTOOD THAT ONSLAUGHT OF THE MARKMEN FOR THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE
4576-66268-0031 BUT NOT AS DASTARDS AND HAD NOT THIODOLF FOLLOWED HARD IN THE CHASE ACCORDING TO HIS WONT THEY MIGHT EVEN YET HAVE MADE A FRESH STAND AND SPREAD FROM OAK TREE TO OAK TREE ACROSS THE GLADE BUT AS IT BEFEL THEY MIGHT NOT GET A FAIR OFFING
4576-66268-0032 BUT THE REST FLED THIS WAY AND THAT WAY INTO THE THICKET WITH WHOM WERE SOME OF THE BURGUNDIANS SO THERE THEY ABIDE NOW AS OUTCASTS AND MEN UNHOLY TO BE SLAIN AS WILD BEASTS ONE BY ONE AS WE MEET THEM
4576-66268-0033 SUCH THEN WAS THE BATTLE IN MIRKWOOD GIVE ME THE MEAD HORN THAT I MAY DRINK TO THE LIVING AND THE DEAD AND THE MEMORY OF THE DEAD AND THE DEEDS OF THE LIVING THAT ARE TO BE SO THEY BROUGHT HIM THE HORN
4576-66268-0034 AND WE LEFT THEM FOR THE WOLVES TO DEAL WITH AND TWENTY FIVE MEN OF THE ROMANS WE TOOK ALIVE TO BE FOR HOSTAGES IF NEED SHOULD BE AND THESE DID WE SHIELDING MEN WHO ARE NOT VERY MANY BRING ABACK TO THE WAIN BURG
4576-66268-0035 TAKEN FROM THE COFFER WHICH WAS BUT SELDOM OPENED BECAUSE THE CLOTHS IT HELD WERE PRECIOUS AND THEY SET A GARLAND OF GREEN WHEAT EARS ON HIS HEAD THEN THEY FELL TO AND SPREAD THE FEAST IN THE HALL
4576-66268-0036 AND THEY ATE AND DRANK AND WERE MERRY BUT AS FOR SPEEDING THE TIDINGS THE HALL SUN SENT TWO WOMEN AND TWO LADS ALL A HORSEBACK TO BEAR THE WORDS THE WOMEN TO REMEMBER THE WORDS WHICH SHE TAUGHT THEM CAREFULLY
4576-66268-0037 SINCE SHE WAS SO WISE IN THE ANCIENT LORE BUT WHEN THEY SOUGHT FOR HER ON ALL SIDES SHE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND NOR COULD ANYONE REMEMBER SEEING HER DEPART FROM THE HALL BUT
