1097-136910-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY DAY AFTER DAY AS HE BENT HIS STEPS HOMEWARD RETURNING FROM SOME NEW EFFORT TO PROCURE EMPLOYMENT KIT RAISED HIS EYES TO THE WINDOW OF THE LITTLE ROOM HE HAD SO MUCH COMMENDED TO THE CHILD
1097-136910-0001 AND HOPED TO SEE SOME INDICATION OF HER PRESENCE HIS OWN EARNEST WISH
1097-136910-0002 FILLED HIM WITH THE BELIEF THAT SHE WOULD YET ARRIVE TO CLAIM THE HUMBLE SHELTER HE HAD OFFERED AND FROM THE DEATH OF EACH DAY'S HOPE ANOTHER HOPE SPRUNG UP TO LIVE TO MORROW I THINK THEY MUST CERTAINLY COME TO MORROW EH MOTHER
1097-136910-0003 SAID KIT LAYING ASIDE HIS HAT WITH A WEARY AIR AND SIGHING AS HE SPOKE THEY HAVE BEEN GONE A WEEK THEY SURELY COULDN'T STOP AWAY MORE THAN A WEEK COULD THEY NOW THE MOTHER SHOOK HER HEAD AND REMINDED HIM HOW OFTEN HE HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED ALREADY
1097-136910-0004 LONGER THAN ENOUGH BUT THEY MAY NOT COME BACK FOR ALL THAT KIT WAS FOR A MOMENT DISPOSED TO BE VEXED BY THIS CONTRADICTION AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HAVING ANTICIPATED IT IN HIS OWN MIND AND KNOWING HOW JUST IT WAS
1097-136910-0005 BUT THE IMPULSE WAS ONLY MOMENTARY AND THE VEXED LOOK BECAME A KIND ONE BEFORE IT HAD CROSSED THE ROOM THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK MOTHER HAS BECOME OF EM YOU DON'T THINK THEY'VE GONE TO SEA ANYHOW NOT GONE FOR SAILORS CERTAINLY
1097-136910-0006 RETURNED THE MOTHER WITH A SMILE BUT I CAN'T HELP THINKING THAT THEY HAVE GONE TO SOME FOREIGN COUNTRY I SAY CRIED KIT WITH A RUEFUL FACE DON'T TALK LIKE THAT MOTHER I AM AFRAID THEY HAVE AND THAT'S THE TRUTH SHE SAID
1097-136910-0007 IT'S THE TALK OF ALL THE NEIGHBOURS AND THERE ARE SOME EVEN THAT KNOW OF THEIR HAVING BEEN SEEN ON BOARD SHIP AND CAN TELL YOU THE NAME OF THE PLACE THEY'VE GONE TO WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN MY DEAR FOR IT'S A VERY HARD ONE I DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID KIT
1097-136910-0008 NOT A WORD OF IT A SET OF IDLE CHATTERBOXES HOW SHOULD THEY KNOW THEY MAY BE WRONG OF COURSE RETURNED THE MOTHER I CAN'T TELL ABOUT THAT THOUGH I DON'T THINK IT'S AT ALL UNLIKELY THAT THEY'RE IN THE RIGHT
1097-136910-0009 FOR THE TALK IS THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD PUT BY A LITTLE MONEY THAT NOBODY KNEW OF
1097-136910-0010 WHAT'S HIS NAME QUILP AND THAT HE AND MISS NELL HAVE GONE TO LIVE ABROAD WHERE IT CAN'T BE TAKEN FROM THEM AND THEY WILL NEVER BE DISTURBED THAT DON'T SEEM VERY FAR OUT OF THE WAY NOW DO IT KIT SCRATCHED HIS HEAD MOURNFULLY
1097-136910-0011 IN RELUCTANT ADMISSION THAT IT DID NOT AND CLAMBERING UP TO THE OLD NAIL TOOK DOWN THE CAGE AND SET HIMSELF TO CLEAN IT AND TO FEED THE BIRD HIS THOUGHTS REVERTING FROM THIS OCCUPATION TO THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN WHO HAD GIVEN HIM THE SHILLING
1097-136910-0012 HE SUDDENLY RECOLLECTED THAT THAT WAS THE VERY DAY NAY NEARLY THE VERY HOUR AT WHICH THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD SAID HE SHOULD BE AT THE NOTARY'S HOUSE AGAIN HE NO SOONER REMEMBERED THIS
1097-136910-0013 WENT OFF AT FULL SPEED TO THE APPOINTED PLACE IT WAS SOME TWO MINUTES AFTER THE TIME WHEN HE REACHED THE SPOT WHICH WAS A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM HIS HOME BUT BY GREAT GOOD LUCK THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD NOT YET ARRIVED
1097-136910-0014 AT LEAST THERE WAS NO PONY CHAISE TO BE SEEN AND IT WAS NOT LIKELY THAT HE HAD COME AND GONE AGAIN IN SO SHORT A SPACE GREATLY RELIEVED TO FIND THAT HE WAS NOT TOO LATE KIT LEANT AGAINST A LAMP POST TO TAKE BREATH
1097-136910-0015 AND WAITED THE ADVENT OF THE PONY AND HIS CHARGE SURE ENOUGH BEFORE LONG THE PONY CAME TROTTING ROUND THE CORNER OF THE STREET LOOKING AS OBSTINATE AS PONY MIGHT
1097-136910-0016 AND WOULD BY NO MEANS DIRTY HIS FEET OR HURRY HIMSELF INCONVENIENTLY BEHIND THE PONY SAT THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN AND BY THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S SIDE SAT THE LITTLE OLD LADY CARRYING JUST SUCH A NOSEGAY AS SHE HAD BROUGHT BEFORE
1097-136910-0017 UNTIL THEY ARRIVED WITHIN SOME HALF A DOZEN DOORS OF THE NOTARY'S HOUSE WHEN THE PONY DECEIVED BY A BRASS PLATE BENEATH A TAILOR'S KNOCKER CAME TO A HALT AND MAINTAINED BY A STURDY SILENCE THAT THAT WAS THE HOUSE THEY WANTED
1097-136910-0018 NOW SIR WILL YOU HA THE GOODNESS TO GO ON THIS IS NOT THE PLACE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE PONY LOOKED WITH GREAT ATTENTION INTO A FIRE PLUG WHICH WAS NEAR HIM AND APPEARED TO BE QUITE ABSORBED IN CONTEMPLATING IT
1097-136910-0019 CRIED THE OLD LADY AFTER BEING SO GOOD TOO AND COMING ALONG SO WELL I AM QUITE ASHAMED OF HIM I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE TO DO WITH HIM I REALLY DON'T
1097-136910-0020 THE PONY HAVING THOROUGHLY SATISFIED HIMSELF AS TO THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF THE FIRE PLUG LOOKED INTO THE AIR AFTER HIS OLD ENEMIES THE FLIES AND AS THERE HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF THEM TICKLING HIS EAR AT THAT MOMENT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND WHISKED HIS TAIL
1097-136910-0021 AFTER WHICH HE APPEARED FULL OF THOUGHT BUT QUITE COMFORTABLE AND COLLECTED THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAVING EXHAUSTED HIS POWERS OF PERSUASION ALIGHTED TO LEAD HIM WHEREUPON THE PONY PERHAPS BECAUSE HE HELD THIS TO BE A SUFFICIENT CONCESSION
1097-136910-0022 PERHAPS BECAUSE HE HAPPENED TO CATCH SIGHT OF THE OTHER BRASS PLATE OR PERHAPS BECAUSE HE WAS IN A SPITEFUL HUMOUR DARTED OFF WITH THE OLD LADY AND STOPPED AT THE RIGHT HOUSE LEAVING THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO COME PANTING ON BEHIND
1097-136910-0023 IT WAS THEN THAT KIT PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE PONY'S HEAD AND TOUCHED HIS HAT WITH A SMILE WHY BLESS ME CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE LAD IS HERE MY DEAR DO YOU SEE

1097-136910-0025 REJOINED THE OLD LADY A VERY GOOD LAD AND I AM SURE HE IS A GOOD SON KIT ACKNOWLEDGED THESE EXPRESSIONS OF CONFIDENCE BY TOUCHING HIS HAT AGAIN AND BLUSHING VERY MUCH
1097-136910-0026 THE OLD GENTLEMAN THEN HANDED THE OLD LADY OUT AND AFTER LOOKING AT HIM WITH AN APPROVING SMILE THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE TALKING ABOUT HIM AS THEY WENT KIT COULD NOT HELP FEELING PRESENTLY
1097-136910-0027 MISTER WITHERDEN SMELLING VERY HARD AT THE NOSEGAY CAME TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED AT HIM AND AFTER THAT MISTER ABEL CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM AND AFTER THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND LADY CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM AGAIN
1097-136910-0028 AND AFTER THAT THEY ALL CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM TOGETHER WHICH KIT FEELING VERY MUCH EMBARRASSED BY MADE A PRETENCE OF NOT OBSERVING THEREFORE HE PATTED THE PONY MORE AND MORE AND THIS LIBERTY THE PONY MOST HANDSOMELY PERMITTED
1097-136910-0029 THAT HE INCLINED TO THE LATTER OPINION KIT ENTERED THE OFFICE IN A GREAT TREMOR FOR HE WAS NOT USED TO GOING AMONG STRANGE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND THE TIN BOXES AND BUNDLES OF DUSTY PAPERS HAD IN HIS EYES AN AWFUL AND VENERABLE AIR
1097-136910-0030 MISTER WITHERDEN TOO WAS A BUSTLING GENTLEMAN WHO TALKED LOUD AND FAST AND ALL EYES WERE UPON HIM AND HE WAS VERY SHABBY WELL BOY SAID MISTER WITHERDEN YOU CAME TO WORK OUT THAT SHILLING NOT TO GET ANOTHER HEY

1097-136910-0032 KIT MADE ANSWER NOT WITHOUT SOME INDIGNATION THAT SHE WAS A WIDOW WITH THREE CHILDREN AND THAT AS TO HER MARRYING AGAIN IF THE GENTLEMAN KNEW HER HE WOULDN'T THINK OF SUCH A THING AT THIS REPLY MISTER WITHERDEN BURIED HIS NOSE IN THE FLOWERS AGAIN
1097-136910-0033 AND WHISPERED BEHIND THE NOSEGAY TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN THAT HE BELIEVED THE LAD WAS AS HONEST A LAD AS NEED BE NOW SAID MISTER GARLAND WHEN THEY HAD MADE SOME FURTHER INQUIRIES OF HIM
1097-136910-0034 AND QUITE SERIOUSLY TOO FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SEEMED TO FREE HIM FROM THE SUSPICION WHICH THE NOTARY HAD HINTED BUT RESUMED THE OLD GENTLEMAN PERHAPS I MAY WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING MORE ABOUT YOU SO TELL ME WHERE YOU LIVE AND I'LL PUT IT DOWN IN MY POCKET BOOK
1097-136910-0035 KIT TOLD HIM AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WROTE DOWN THE ADDRESS WITH HIS PENCIL HE HAD SCARCELY DONE SO WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT UPROAR IN THE STREET AND THE OLD LADY HURRYING TO THE WINDOW CRIED THAT WHISKER HAD RUN AWAY
1097-136910-0036 UPON WHICH KIT DARTED OUT TO THE RESCUE AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED IT SEEMED THAT MISTER CHUCKSTER HAD BEEN STANDING WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS LOOKING CARELESSLY AT THE PONY AND OCCASIONALLY INSULTING HIM WITH SUCH ADMONITIONS AS
1097-136910-0037 AND THE LIKE WHICH BY A PONY OF SPIRIT CANNOT BE BORNE CONSEQUENTLY THE PONY BEING DETERRED BY NO CONSIDERATIONS OF DUTY OR OBEDIENCE AND NOT HAVING BEFORE HIM THE SLIGHTEST FEAR OF THE HUMAN EYE HAD AT LENGTH STARTED OFF
1097-136910-0038 AND WAS AT THAT MOMENT RATTLING DOWN THE STREET MISTER CHUCKSTER WITH HIS HAT OFF AND A PEN BEHIND HIS EAR HANGING ON IN THE REAR OF THE CHAISE AND MAKING FUTILE ATTEMPTS TO DRAW IT THE OTHER WAY TO THE UNSPEAKABLE ADMIRATION OF ALL BEHOLDERS
1097-136910-0039 BY THESE MEANS MISTER CHUCKSTER WAS PUSHED AND HUSTLED TO THE OFFICE AGAIN IN A MOST INGLORIOUS MANNER AND ARRIVED IN A STATE OF GREAT EXHAUSTION AND DISCOMFITURE THE OLD LADY THEN STEPPED INTO HER SEAT
1097-136910-0040 AND MISTER ABEL WHOM THEY HAD COME TO FETCH INTO HIS THE OLD GENTLEMAN AFTER REASONING WITH THE PONY ON THE EXTREME IMPROPRIETY OF HIS CONDUCT
