1445-139404-0000 A MAN WHO IS NOT BORN WITH THE NOVEL WRITING GIFT HAS A TROUBLESOME TIME OF IT WHEN HE TRIES TO BUILD A NOVEL I KNOW THIS FROM EXPERIENCE HE HAS NO CLEAR IDEA OF HIS STORY
1445-139404-0001 IN FACT HE HAS NO STORY HE MERELY HAS SOME PEOPLE IN HIS MIND AND AN INCIDENT OR TWO ALSO A LOCALITY AND HE TRUSTS HE CAN PLUNGE THOSE PEOPLE INTO THOSE INCIDENTS WITH INTERESTING RESULTS
1445-139404-0002 IT IS MORE THAN APT TO GO ON AND ON AND ON TILL IT SPREADS ITSELF INTO A BOOK
1445-139404-0003 AND I HAVE NOTICED ANOTHER THING THAT AS THE SHORT TALE GROWS INTO THE LONG TALE THE ORIGINAL INTENTION OR MOTIF IS APT TO GET ABOLISHED AND FIND ITSELF SUPERSEDED BY A QUITE DIFFERENT ONE
1445-139404-0004 IT WAS SO IN THE CASE OF A MAGAZINE SKETCH WHICH I ONCE STARTED TO WRITE A FUNNY AND FANTASTIC SKETCH ABOUT A PRINCE AND A PAUPER IT PRESENTLY ASSUMED A GRAVE CAST OF ITS OWN ACCORD
1445-139404-0005 AND IN THAT NEW SHAPE SPREAD ITSELF OUT INTO A BOOK MUCH THE SAME THING HAPPENED WITH PUDD'NHEAD WILSON I HAD A SUFFICIENTLY HARD TIME WITH THAT TALE
1445-139404-0006 BECAUSE IT CHANGED ITSELF FROM A FARCE TO A TRAGEDY WHILE I WAS GOING ALONG WITH IT A MOST EMBARRASSING CIRCUMSTANCE
1445-139404-0007 IT WAS NOT ONE STORY BUT TWO STORIES TANGLED TOGETHER AND THEY OBSTRUCTED AND INTERRUPTED EACH OTHER AT EVERY TURN AND CREATED NO END OF CONFUSION AND ANNOYANCE I COULD NOT OFFER THE BOOK FOR PUBLICATION
1445-139404-0008 FOR I WAS AFRAID IT WOULD UNSEAT THE READER'S REASON I DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH IT FOR I HAD NOT NOTICED AS YET THAT IT WAS TWO STORIES IN ONE IT TOOK ME MONTHS TO MAKE THAT DISCOVERY
1445-139404-0009 I PULLED ONE OF THE STORIES OUT BY THE ROOTS AND LEFT THE OTHER
1445-139404-0010 WON'T HE LET ME ROUND AND COMPLETE HIS KNOWLEDGE BY TELLING HIM HOW THE JACKLEG DOES IT ORIGINALLY THE STORY WAS CALLED THOSE EXTRAORDINARY TWINS I MEANT TO MAKE IT VERY SHORT
1445-139404-0011 A COMBINATION CONSISTING OF TWO HEADS AND FOUR ARMS JOINED TO A SINGLE BODY AND A SINGLE PAIR OF LEGS AND I THOUGHT I WOULD WRITE AN EXTRAVAGANTLY FANTASTIC LITTLE STORY WITH THIS FREAK OF NATURE FOR HERO
1445-139404-0012 OR HEROES A SILLY YOUNG MISS FOR HEROINE AND TWO OLD LADIES AND TWO BOYS FOR THE MINOR PARTS I LAVISHLY ELABORATED THESE PEOPLE AND THEIR DOINGS OF COURSE
1445-139404-0013 BUT THE TALE KEPT SPREADING ALONG AND SPREADING ALONG AND OTHER PEOPLE GOT TO INTRUDING THEMSELVES AND TAKING UP MORE AND MORE ROOM WITH THEIR TALK AND THEIR AFFAIRS AMONG THEM CAME A STRANGER NAMED PUDD'NHEAD WILSON
1445-139404-0014 AND A WOMAN NAMED ROXANA AND PRESENTLY THE DOINGS OF THESE TWO PUSHED UP INTO PROMINENCE A YOUNG FELLOW NAMED TOM DRISCOLL WHOSE PROPER PLACE WAS AWAY IN THE OBSCURE BACKGROUND
1445-139404-0015 BEFORE THE BOOK WAS HALF FINISHED THOSE THREE WERE TAKING THINGS ALMOST ENTIRELY INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AND WORKING THE WHOLE TALE AS A PRIVATE VENTURE OF THEIR OWN A TALE WHICH THEY HAD NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH BY RIGHTS
1445-139404-0016 THEY WERE NOWHERE TO BE SEEN THEY HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE STORY SOME TIME OR OTHER I HUNTED ABOUT AND FOUND THEM FOUND THEM STRANDED IDLE FORGOTTEN AND PERMANENTLY USELESS
1445-139404-0017 IT WAS VERY AWKWARD IT WAS AWKWARD ALL AROUND BUT MORE PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF ROWENA BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOVE MATCH ON BETWEEN HER AND ONE OF THE TWINS THAT CONSTITUTED THE FREAK
1445-139404-0018 AND HAD DRIVEN HIM FROM HER IN THE USUAL FOREVER WAY AND NOW HERE SHE SAT CRYING AND BROKENHEARTED FOR SHE HAD FOUND THAT HE HAD SPOKEN ONLY THE TRUTH THAT IT WAS NOT HE
1445-139404-0019 BUT THE OTHER OF THE FREAK THAT HAD DRUNK THE LIQUOR THAT MADE HIM DRUNK THAT HER HALF WAS A PROHIBITIONIST AND HAD NEVER DRUNK A DROP IN HIS LIFE AND ALTOGETHER TIGHT AS A BRICK THREE DAYS IN THE WEEK WAS WHOLLY INNOCENT OF BLAME
1445-139404-0020 AND INDEED WHEN SOBER WAS CONSTANTLY DOING ALL HE COULD TO REFORM HIS BROTHER THE OTHER HALF WHO NEVER GOT ANY SATISFACTION OUT OF DRINKING ANYWAY BECAUSE LIQUOR NEVER AFFECTED HIM YES HERE SHE WAS
1445-139404-0021 I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HER I WAS AS SORRY FOR HER AS ANYBODY COULD BE BUT THE CAMPAIGN WAS OVER THE BOOK WAS FINISHED
1445-139404-0022 SHE WAS SIDETRACKED AND THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE WAY OF CROWDING HER IN ANYWHERE I COULD NOT LEAVE HER THERE OF COURSE IT WOULD NOT DO AFTER SPREADING HER OUT SO AND MAKING SUCH A TO DO OVER HER AFFAIRS
1445-139404-0023 IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT TO THE READER FOR HER I THOUGHT AND THOUGHT AND STUDIED AND STUDIED BUT I ARRIVED AT NOTHING I FINALLY SAW PLAINLY THAT THERE WAS REALLY NO WAY BUT ONE
1445-139404-0024 SAID SUCH STUPID IRRITATING THINGS AND WAS SO NAUSEATINGLY SENTIMENTAL STILL IT HAD TO BE DONE SO AT THE TOP OF CHAPTER SEVENTEEN I PUT A CALENDAR REMARK CONCERNING JULY THE FOURTH
1445-139404-0025 AND BEGAN THE CHAPTER WITH THIS STATISTIC ROWENA WENT OUT IN THE BACKYARD AFTER SUPPER TO SEE THE FIREWORKS AND FELL DOWN THE WELL AND GOT DROWNED IT SEEMED ABRUPT
1445-139404-0026 IT SEEMED A PROMPT GOOD WAY OF WEEDING OUT PEOPLE THAT HAD GOT STALLED AND A PLENTY GOOD ENOUGH WAY FOR THOSE OTHERS SO I HUNTED UP THE TWO BOYS AND SAID THEY WENT OUT BACK ONE NIGHT TO STONE THE CAT
1445-139404-0027 AND FELL DOWN THE WELL AND GOT DROWNED NEXT I SEARCHED AROUND AND FOUND OLD AUNT PATSY AND AUNT BETSY HALE WHERE THEY WERE AROUND AND SAID THEY WENT OUT BACK ONE NIGHT TO VISIT THE SICK
1445-139404-0028 AND FELL DOWN THE WELL AND GOT DROWNED I WAS GOING TO DROWN SOME OTHERS BUT I GAVE UP THE IDEA PARTLY BECAUSE I BELIEVED THAT IF I KEPT THAT UP IT WOULD AROUSE ATTENTION
1445-139404-0029 AND PERHAPS SYMPATHY WITH THOSE PEOPLE AND PARTLY BECAUSE IT WAS NOT A LARGE WELL AND WOULD NOT HOLD ANY MORE ANYWAY STILL THE STORY WAS UNSATISFACTORY
1445-139404-0030 HERE WAS A SET OF NEW CHARACTERS WHO WERE BECOME INORDINATELY PROMINENT AND WHO PERSISTED IN REMAINING SO TO THE END AND BACK YONDER WAS AN OLDER SET WHO MADE A LARGE NOISE AND A GREAT TO DO FOR A LITTLE WHILE
1445-139404-0031 THERE WAS A RADICAL DEFECT SOMEWHERE AND I MUST SEARCH IT OUT AND CURE IT THE DEFECT TURNED OUT TO BE THE ONE ALREADY SPOKEN OF TWO STORIES IN ONE
1445-139404-0032 A FARCE AND A TRAGEDY SO I PULLED OUT THE FARCE AND LEFT THE TRAGEDY THIS LEFT THE ORIGINAL TEAM IN BUT ONLY AS MERE NAMES NOT AS CHARACTERS THEIR PROMINENCE WAS WHOLLY GONE
1445-139404-0033 THEY WERE NOT EVEN WORTH DROWNING SO I REMOVED THAT DETAIL ALSO I TOOK THE TWINS APART AND MADE TWO SEPARATE MEN OF THEM
