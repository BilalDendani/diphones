3744-178594-0000 EVEN IN HIS SLEEP THIS GAVE HIM AN AIR OF WISTFULNESS THUS BEING ASLEEP IN A NOOK BEHIND THE METAL REFUSE CAN WHEN THE STRANGE CAT VENTURED TO ASCEND THE STEPS OF THE PORCH
3744-178594-0001 AND THE BACKBONE OF A THREE POUND WHITEFISH LAY AT THE FOOT OF THE REFUSE CAN
3744-178594-0002 INDEPENDENT AND MASCULINE ONCE LONG AGO HE HAD BEEN A ROLY POLY PEPPER AND SALT KITTEN HE HAD A HOME IN THOSE DAYS AND A NAME GIPSY WHICH HE ABUNDANTLY JUSTIFIED HE WAS PRECOCIOUS IN DISSIPATION
3744-178594-0003 LONG BEFORE HIS ADOLESCENCE HIS LACK OF DOMESTICITY WAS OMINOUS AND HE HAD FORMED BAD COMPANIONSHIPS MEANWHILE HE GREW SO RANGY AND DEVELOPED SUCH LENGTH AND POWER OF LEG AND SUCH TRAITS OF CHARACTER
3744-178594-0004 THAT THE FATHER OF THE LITTLE GIRL WHO OWNED HIM WAS ALMOST CONVINCING WHEN HE DECLARED THAT THE YOUNG CAT WAS HALF BRONCHO AND HALF MALAY PIRATE THOUGH IN THE LIGHT OF GIPSY'S LATER CAREER THIS SEEMS BITTERLY UNFAIR TO EVEN THE LOWEST ORDERS OF BRONCHOS AND MALAY PIRATES NO
3744-178594-0005 GIPSY WAS NOT THE PET FOR A LITTLE GIRL THE ROSY HEARTHSTONE AND SHELTERED RUG WERE TOO CIRCUMSPECT FOR HIM SURROUNDED BY THE COMFORTS OF MIDDLE CLASS RESPECTABILITY AND PROFOUNDLY OPPRESSED EVEN IN HIS YOUTH BY THE PURITAN IDEALS OF THE HOUSEHOLD
3744-178594-0006 HE SOMETIMES EXPERIENCED A SENSE OF SUFFOCATION HE WANTED FREE AIR AND HE WANTED FREE LIFE HE WANTED THE LIGHTS THE LIGHTS AND THE MUSIC HE ABANDONED THE BOURGEOISE IRREVOCABLY HE WENT FORTH IN A MAY TWILIGHT CARRYING THE EVENING BEEFSTEAK WITH HIM AND JOINED THE UNDERWORLD
3744-178594-0007 HIS EXTRAORDINARY SIZE HIS DARING AND HIS UTTER LACK OF SYMPATHY SOON MADE HIM THE LEADER AND AT THE SAME TIME THE TERROR OF ALL THE LOOSE LIVED CATS IN A WIDE NEIGHBOURHOOD HE CONTRACTED NO FRIENDSHIPS AND HAD NO CONFIDANTS
3744-178594-0008 HE SELDOM SLEPT IN THE SAME PLACE TWICE IN SUCCESSION AND THOUGH HE WAS WANTED BY THE POLICE HE WAS NOT FOUND IN APPEARANCE HE DID NOT LACK DISTINCTION OF AN OMINOUS SORT THE SLOW RHYTHMIC PERFECTLY CONTROLLED MECHANISM OF HIS TAIL
3744-178594-0009 AS HE IMPRESSIVELY WALKED ABROAD WAS INCOMPARABLY SINISTER THIS STATELY AND DANGEROUS WALK OF HIS HIS LONG VIBRANT WHISKERS HIS SCARS HIS YELLOW EYE SO ICE COLD SO FIRE HOT HAUGHTY AS THE EYE OF SATAN
3744-178594-0010 HIS SOUL WAS IN THAT WALK AND IN THAT EYE IT COULD BE READ
3744-178594-0011 LIVING ON HIS WITS AND HIS VELOUR ASKING NO FAVOURS AND GRANTING NO QUARTER INTOLERANT PROUD SULLEN YET WATCHFUL AND CONSTANTLY PLANNING PURELY A MILITARIST BELIEVING IN SLAUGHTER AS IN A RELIGION
3744-178594-0012 AND CONFIDENT THAT ART SCIENCE POETRY AND THE GOOD OF THE WORLD WERE HAPPILY ADVANCED THEREBY GIPSY HAD BECOME THOUGH TECHNICALLY NOT A WILDCAT UNDOUBTEDLY THE MOST UNTAMED CAT AT LARGE IN THE CIVILIZED WORLD
3744-178594-0013 SUCH IN BRIEF WAS THE TERRIFYING CREATURE THAT NOW ELONGATED ITS NECK AND OVER THE TOP STEP OF THE PORCH BENT A CALCULATING SCRUTINY UPON THE WISTFUL AND SLUMBEROUS DUKE THE SCRUTINY WAS SEARCHING BUT NOT PROLONGED GIPSY MUTTERED CONTEMPTUOUSLY TO HIMSELF
3744-178594-0014 OH SHEOL I'M NOT AFRAID O THAT AND HE APPROACHED THE FISHBONE HIS PADDED FEET MAKING NO NOISE UPON THE BOARDS IT WAS A DESIRABLE FISHBONE LARGE WITH A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE FISH'S TAIL STILL ATTACHED TO IT
3744-178594-0015 IT WAS ABOUT A FOOT FROM DUKE'S NOSE AND THE LITTLE DOG'S DREAMS BEGAN TO BE TROUBLED BY HIS OLFACTORY NERVE THIS FAITHFUL SENTINEL ON GUARD EVEN WHILE DUKE SLEPT SIGNALLED THAT ALARUMS AND EXCURSIONS BY PARTIES UNKNOWN WERE TAKING PLACE
3744-178594-0016 AND SUGGESTED THAT ATTENTION MIGHT WELL BE PAID DUKE OPENED ONE DROWSY EYE WHAT THAT EYE BEHELD WAS MONSTROUS HERE WAS A STRANGE EXPERIENCE THE HORRIFIC VISION IN THE MIDST OF THINGS SO ACCUSTOMED
3744-178594-0017 SUNSHINE FELL SWEETLY UPON PORCH AND BACKYARD YONDER WAS THE FAMILIAR STABLE AND FROM ITS INTERIOR CAME THE BUSY HUM OF A CARPENTER SHOP ESTABLISHED THAT MORNING BY DUKE'S YOUNG MASTER IN ASSOCIATION WITH SAMUEL WILLIAMS AND HERMAN
3744-178594-0018 HERE CLOSE BY WERE THE QUIET REFUSE CAN AND THE WONTED BROOMS AND MOPS LEANING AGAINST THE LATTICED WALL AT THE END OF THE PORCH AND THERE BY THE FOOT OF THE STEPS WAS THE STONE SLAB OF THE CISTERN WITH THE IRON COVER DISPLACED AND LYING BESIDE THE ROUND OPENING
3744-178594-0019 WHERE THE CARPENTERS HAD LEFT IT NOT HALF AN HOUR AGO AFTER LOWERING A STICK OF WOOD INTO THE WATER TO SEASON IT ALL ABOUT DUKE WERE THESE USUAL AND REASSURING ENVIRONS OF HIS DAILY LIFE AND YET IT WAS HIS FATE TO BEHOLD
3744-178594-0020 RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THEM AND IN GHASTLY JUXTAPOSITION TO HIS FACE A THING OF NIGHTMARE AND LUNACY GIPSY HAD SEIZED THE FISHBONE BY THE MIDDLE OUT FROM ONE SIDE OF HIS HEAD AND MINGLING WITH HIS WHISKERS PROJECTED THE LONG SPIKED SPINE OF THE BIG FISH
3744-178594-0021 DOWN FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT FEROCIOUS HEAD DANGLED THE FISH'S TAIL AND FROM ABOVE THE REMARKABLE EFFECT THUS PRODUCED SHOT THE INTOLERABLE GLARE OF TWO YELLOW EYES TO THE GAZE OF DUKE STILL BLURRED BY SLUMBER THIS MONSTROSITY WAS ALL OF ONE PIECE
3744-178594-0022 THE BONE SEEMED A LIVING PART OF IT WHAT HE SAW WAS LIKE THOSE INTERESTING INSECT FACES THAT THE MAGNIFYING GLASS REVEALS TO GREAT M FABRE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR DUKE TO MAINTAIN THE PHILOSOPHIC CALM OF M FABRE HOWEVER
3744-178594-0023 THERE WAS NO MAGNIFYING GLASS BETWEEN HIM AND THIS SPINED AND SPIKY FACE INDEED DUKE WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO THINK THE MATTER OVER QUIETLY IF HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT HE WOULD HAVE SAID TO HIMSELF
3744-178594-0024 WE HAVE HERE AN ANIMAL OF MOST PECULIAR AND UNATTRACTIVE APPEARANCE THOUGH UPON EXAMINATION IT SEEMS TO BE ONLY A CAT STEALING A FISHBONE
3744-178594-0025 I WILL LEAVE THIS SPOT AT ONCE ON THE CONTRARY DUKE WAS SO ELECTRIFIED BY HIS HORRID AWAKENING THAT HE COMPLETELY LOST HIS PRESENCE OF MIND IN THE VERY INSTANT OF HIS FIRST EYE'S OPENING THE OTHER EYE AND HIS MOUTH BEHAVED SIMILARLY
3744-178594-0026 THE LATTER LOOSING UPON THE QUIET AIR ONE SHRIEK OF MENTAL AGONY BEFORE THE LITTLE DOG SCRAMBLED TO HIS FEET AND GAVE FURTHER EMPLOYMENT TO HIS VOICE IN A FRENZY OF PROFANITY AT THE SAME TIME THE SUBTERRANEAN DIAPASON OF A DEMONIAC BASS VIOL WAS HEARD
3744-178594-0027 IT ROSE TO A WAIL AND ROSE AND ROSE AGAIN TILL IT SCREAMED LIKE A SMALL SIREN IT WAS GIPSY'S WAR CRY AND AT THE SOUND OF IT DUKE BECAME A FROTHING MANIAC HE MADE A CONVULSIVE FRONTAL ATTACK UPON THE HOBGOBLIN AND THE MASSACRE BEGAN
3744-178594-0028 NEVER RELEASING THE FISHBONE FOR AN INSTANT GIPSY LAID BACK HIS EARS IN A CHILLING WAY BEGINNING TO SHRINK INTO HIMSELF LIKE A CONCERTINA BUT RISING AMIDSHIPS SO HIGH THAT HE APPEARED TO BE GIVING AN IMITATION OF THAT PEACEFUL BEAST THE DROMEDARY
3744-178594-0029 SUCH WAS NOT HIS PURPOSE HOWEVER FOR HAVING ATTAINED HIS GREATEST POSSIBLE ALTITUDE
3744-178594-0030 THIS SEMAPHORE ARM REMAINED RIGID FOR A SECOND THREATENING THEN IT VIBRATED WITH INCONCEIVABLE RAPIDITY FEINTING BUT IT WAS THE TREACHEROUS LEFT THAT DID THE WORK SEEMINGLY THIS LEFT GAVE DUKE THREE LIGHTNING LITTLE PATS UPON THE RIGHT EAR
3744-178594-0031 BUT THE CHANGE IN HIS VOICE INDICATED THAT THESE WERE NO LOVE TAPS HE YELLED HELP
3744-178594-0032 GIPSY POSSESSED A VOCABULARY FOR CAT SWEARING CERTAINLY SECOND TO NONE OUT OF ITALY AND PROBABLY EQUAL TO THE BEST THERE WHILE DUKE REMEMBERED AND UTTERED THINGS HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF FOR YEARS THE HUM OF THE CARPENTER SHOP CEASED
3744-178594-0033 AND SAM WILLIAMS APPEARED IN THE STABLE DOORWAY HE STARED INSANELY MY GORRY HE SHOUTED
3744-178594-0034 WITH PENROD AND HERMAN HURRYING IN HIS WAKE ONWARD THEY SPED AND DUKE WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE SIGHT AND SOUND OF THESE REENFORCEMENTS TO INCREASE HIS OWN OUTRAGEOUS CLAMOURS AND TO PRESS HOME HIS ATTACK BUT HE WAS ILL ADVISED
3744-178594-0035 AND DUKE'S HONEST NOSE WAS BUT TOO CONSCIOUS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN CONSEQUENCE A LUMP OF DIRT STRUCK THE REFUSE CAN WITH VIOLENCE AND GIPSY BEHELD THE ADVANCE OF OVERWHELMING FORCES THEY RUSHED UPON HIM FROM TWO DIRECTIONS CUTTING OFF THE STEPS OF THE PORCH
3744-178594-0036 UNDAUNTED THE FORMIDABLE CAT RAKED DUKE'S NOSE AGAIN SOMEWHAT MORE LINGERINGLY AND PREPARED TO DEPART WITH HIS FISHBONE HE HAD LITTLE FEAR FOR HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS INCLINED TO THINK THAT UNHAMPERED HE COULD WHIP ANYTHING ON EARTH STILL
3744-178594-0037 THINGS SEEMED TO BE GROWING RATHER WARM AND HE SAW NOTHING TO PREVENT HIS LEAVING AND THOUGH HE COULD LAUGH IN THE FACE OF SO UNEQUAL AN ANTAGONIST AS DUKE GIPSY FELT THAT HE WAS NEVER AT HIS BEST OR ABLE TO DO HIMSELF FULL JUSTICE
3744-178594-0038 UNLESS HE COULD PERFORM THAT FELINE OPERATION INACCURATELY KNOWN AS SPITTING TO HIS NOTION THIS WAS AN ABSOLUTE ESSENTIAL TO COMBAT BUT AS ALL CATS OF THE SLIGHTEST PRETENSIONS TO TECHNIQUE PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND IT CAN NEITHER BE WELL DONE NOR PRODUCE THE BEST EFFECTS
3744-178594-0039 UNLESS THE MOUTH BE OPENED TO ITS UTMOST CAPACITY SO AS TO EXPOSE THE BEGINNINGS OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL DOWN WHICH AT LEAST THAT IS THE INTENTION OF THE THREAT THE OPPOSING PARTY WILL SOON BE PASSING AND GIPSY COULD NOT OPEN HIS MOUTH WITHOUT RELINQUISHING HIS FISHBONE
3744-178594-0040 THEREFORE ON SMALL ACCOUNTS HE DECIDED TO LEAVE THE FIELD TO HIS ENEMIES AND TO CARRY THE FISHBONE ELSEWHERE HE TOOK TWO GIANT LEAPS THE FIRST LANDED HIM UPON THE EDGE OF THE PORCH THERE WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S PAUSE
3744-178594-0041 HE GATHERED HIS FUR SHEATHED MUSCLES CONCENTRATED HIMSELF INTO ONE BIG STEEL SPRING AND LAUNCHED HIMSELF SUPERBLY INTO SPACE HE MADE A STIRRING PICTURE HOWEVER BRIEF
3744-178594-0042 AS HE LEFT THE SOLID PORCH BEHIND HIM AND SAILED UPWARD ON AN ASCENDING CURVE INTO THE SUNLIT AIR HIS HEAD WAS PROUDLY UP HE WAS THE INCARNATION OF MENACING POWER AND OF SELF CONFIDENCE
3744-178594-0043 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE WHITEFISH'S SPINAL COLUMN AND FLOPPING TAIL HAD INTERFERED WITH HIS VISION AND IN LAUNCHING HIMSELF HE MAY HAVE MISTAKEN THE DARK ROUND OPENING OF THE CISTERN FOR ITS DARK ROUND COVER IN THAT CASE IT WAS A LEAP CALCULATED AND EXECUTED WITH PRECISION
