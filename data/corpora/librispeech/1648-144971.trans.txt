1648-144971-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE BIRD TRAGEDY ON LAYSAN ISLAND THIS CHAPTER IS A CURTAIN DROPPER TO THE PRECEDING CHAPTER AS A CLEARLY CUT CONCRETE CASE THE READER WILL FIND IT UNIQUE AND UNSURPASSED
1648-144971-0001 IT SHOULD BE OF LIVELY INTEREST TO EVERY AMERICAN BECAUSE THE TRAGEDY OCCURRED ON AMERICAN TERRITORY IN THE FAR AWAY NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILES FROM HONOLULU WEST B NORTH
1648-144971-0002 LIES THE SMALL ISLAND OF LAYSAN IT IS LEVEL SANDY POORLY PLANTED BY NATURE AND BARREN OF ALL THINGS LIKELY TO ENLIST THE ATTENTION OF PREDATORY MAN TO THE HARASSED BIRDS OF MID OCEAN
1648-144971-0003 IT SEEMED LIKE A SECURE HAVEN AND FOR AGES PAST IT HAS BEEN INHABITED ONLY BY THEM THERE SEVERAL SPECIES OF SEA BIRDS LARGE AND SMALL HAVE FOUND HOMES AND BREEDING PLACES
1648-144971-0004 UNTIL NINETEEN O NINE THE INHABITANTS CONSISTED OF THE LAYSAN ALBATROSS BLACK FOOTED ALBATROSS SOOTY TERN GRAY BACKED TERN NODDY TERN HAWAIIAN TERN WHITE TERN
1648-144971-0005 BONIN PETREL TWO SHEARWATERS THE RED TAILED TROPIC BIRD TWO BOOBIES AND THE MAN OF WAR BIRD LAYSAN ISLAND IS TWO MILES LONG BY ONE AND ONE HALF MILES BROAD
1648-144971-0006 AND AT TIMES IT HAS BEEN LITERALLY COVERED WITH BIRDS ITS BIRD LIFE WAS FIRST BROUGHT PROMINENTLY TO NOTICE IN EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE BY HENRY PALMER THE AGENT OF HON WALTER ROTHSCHILD
1648-144971-0007 WALTER K FISHER AND W A BRYAN MADE FURTHER OBSERVATIONS EVER SINCE EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE THE BIRD LIFE ON LAYSAN HAS BEEN REGARDED AS ONE OF THE WONDERS OF THE BIRD WORLD ONE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS
1648-144971-0008 TAKEN PRIOR TO NINETEEN O NINE SHOWS A VAST PLAIN APPARENTLY A SQUARE MILE IN AREA COVERED AND CROWDED WITH LAYSAN ALBATROSSES THEY STAND THERE ON THE LEVEL SAND SERENE BULKY AND IMMACULATE
1648-144971-0009 THOUSANDS OF BIRDS APPEAR IN ONE VIEW A VERY REMARKABLE SIGHT NATURALLY MAN THE EVER GREEDY BEGAN TO CAST ABOUT FOR WAYS BY WHICH TO CONVERT SOME PRODUCT OF THAT FEATHERED HOST INTO MONEY
1648-144971-0010 AT FIRST GUANO AND EGGS WERE COLLECTED A TRAMWAY WAS LAID DOWN AND SMALL BOX CARS WERE INTRODUCED IN WHICH THE COLLECTED MATERIAL WAS PILED AND PUSHED DOWN TO THE PACKING PLACE FOR SEVERAL YEARS THIS WENT ON
1648-144971-0011 AND THE BIRDS THEMSELVES WERE NOT MOLESTED AT LAST HOWEVER A TENTACLE OF THE FEATHER TRADE OCTOPUS REACHED OUT TO LAYSAN IN AN EVIL MOMENT IN THE SPRING OF NINETEEN O NINE
1648-144971-0012 A PREDATORY INDIVIDUAL OF HONOLULU AND ELSEWHERE NAMED MAX SCHLEMMER DECIDED THAT THE WINGS OF THOSE ALBATROSS GULLS AND TERNS
1648-144971-0013 AND TURNED THEM LOOSE UPON THE BIRDS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS THEY SLAUGHTERED DILIGENTLY AND WITHOUT MERCY APPARENTLY IT WAS THE AMBITION OF SCHLEMMER TO KILL EVERY BIRD ON THE ISLAND
1648-144971-0014 BY THE TIME THE BIRD BUTCHERS HAD ACCUMULATED BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR CAR LOADS OF WINGS AND THE CARNAGE WAS HALF FINISHED WILLIAM A BRYAN PROFESSOR OF ZOOLOGY IN THE COLLEGE OF HONOLULU HEARD OF IT
1648-144971-0015 AND PROMPTLY WIRED THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WITHOUT THE LOSS OF A MOMENT THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY DESPATCHED THE REVENUE CUTTER THETIS TO THE SHAMBLES OF LAYSAN WHEN CAPTAIN JACOBS ARRIVED
1648-144971-0016 HE FOUND THAT IN ROUND NUMBERS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND BIRDS HAD BEEN DESTROYED AND ALL THAT REMAINED OF THEM WERE SEVERAL ACRES OF BONES AND DEAD BODIES AND ABOUT THREE CARLOADS OF WINGS FEATHERS AND SKINS
1648-144971-0017 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SCHLEMMER'S INTENTION WAS TO KILL ALL THE BIRDS ON THE ISLAND AND ONLY THE TIMELY ARRIVAL OF THE THETIS FRUSTRATED THAT BLOODY PLAN THE TWENTY THREE JAPANESE POACHERS WERE ARRESTED
1648-144971-0018 THE IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY DESPATCHED TO LAYSAN A SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITION IN CHARGE OF PROFESSOR HOMER R DILL THE PARTY LANDED ON THE ISLAND ON APRIL TWENTY FOURTH
1648-144971-0019 AND THE REPORT OF PROFESSOR DILL U S DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE IS CONSUMEDLY INTERESTING TO THE FRIENDS OF BIRDS HERE IS WHAT HE HAS SAID REGARDING THE EVIDENCES OF BIRD SLAUGHTER
1648-144971-0020 OUR FIRST IMPRESSION OF LAYSAN WAS THAT THE POACHERS HAD STRIPPED THE PLACE OF BIRD LIFE AN AREA OF OVER THREE HUNDRED ACRES ON EACH SIDE OF THE BUILDINGS WAS APPARENTLY ABANDONED
1648-144971-0021 ONLY THE SHEARWATERS MOANING IN THEIR BURROWS THE LITTLE WINGLESS RAIL SKULKING FROM ONE GRASS TUSSOCK TO ANOTHER AND THE SAUCY FINCH REMAINED
1648-144971-0022 IT IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF WHAT PROFESSOR NUTTING CALLS THE SURVIVAL OF THE INCONSPICUOUS HERE ON EVERY SIDE ARE BONES BLEACHING IN THE SUN SHOWING WHERE THE POACHERS HAD PILED THE BODIES OF THE BIRDS
1648-144971-0023 IN THIS WAY THE FATTY TISSUE LYING NEXT TO THE SKIN WAS USED UP AND THE SKIN WAS LEFT QUITE FREE FROM GREASE SO THAT IT REQUIRED LITTLE OR NO CLEANING DURING PREPARATION
1648-144971-0024 MANY OTHER REVOLTING SIGHTS SUCH AS THE REMAINS OF YOUNG BIRDS THAT HAD BEEN LEFT TO STARVE AND BIRDS WITH BROKEN LEGS AND DEFORMED BEAKS WERE TO BE SEEN
1648-144971-0025 KILLING CLUBS NETS AND OTHER IMPLEMENTS USED BY THESE MARAUDERS WERE LYING ALL ABOUT HUNDREDS OF BOXES TO BE USED IN SHIPPING THE BIRD SKINS WERE PACKED IN AN OLD BUILDING IT WAS VERY EVIDENT
1648-144971-0026 THEY INTENDED TO CARRY ON THEIR SLAUGHTER AS LONG AS THE BIRDS LASTED NOT ONLY DID THEY KILL AND SKIN THE LARGER SPECIES BUT THEY CAUGHT AND CAGED THE FINCH HONEY EATER AND MILLER BIRD
1648-144971-0027 CAGES AND MATERIAL FOR MAKING THEM WERE FOUND REPORT OF AN EXPEDITION TO LAYSAN ISLAND IN NINETEEN ELEVEN BY HOMER R DILL PAGE TWELVE THE REPORT OF PROFESSOR BRYAN CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING PERTINENT PARAGRAPHS
1648-144971-0028 THIS WHOLESALE KILLING HAS HAD AN APPALLING EFFECT ON THE COLONY IT IS CONSERVATIVE TO SAY THAT FULLY ONE HALF THE NUMBER OF BIRDS OF BOTH SPECIES OF ALBATROSS THAT WERE SO ABUNDANT EVERYWHERE
1648-144971-0029 THE COLONIES THAT REMAIN ARE IN A SADLY DECIMATED CONDITION OVER A LARGE PART OF THE ISLAND IN SOME SECTIONS A HUNDRED ACRES IN A PLACE THAT TEN YEARS AGO WERE THICKLY INHABITED BY ALBATROSSES
1648-144971-0030 NOT A SINGLE BIRD REMAINS WHILE HEAPS OF THE SLAIN LIE AS MUTE TESTIMONY OF THE AWFUL SLAUGHTER OF THESE BEAUTIFUL HARMLESS AND WITHOUT DOUBT BENEFICIAL INHABITANTS OF THE HIGH SEAS
1648-144971-0031 WHILE THE MAIN ACTIVITY OF THE PLUME HUNTERS WAS DIRECTED AGAINST THE ALBATROSSES THEY WERE BY NO MEANS AVERSE TO KILLING ANYTHING IN THE BIRD LINE THAT CAME IN THEIR WAY FORTUNATELY
1648-144971-0032 SERIOUS AS WERE THE DEPREDATIONS OF THE POACHERS THEIR OPERATIONS WERE INTERRUPTED BEFORE ANY OF THE SPECIES HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXTERMINATED
1648-144971-0033 BUT THE WORK OF THE EVIL GENIUS OF LAYSAN DID NOT STOP WITH THE SLAUGHTER OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND BIRDS MISTER SCHLEMMER INTRODUCED RABBITS AND GUINEA PIGS AND THESE RAPIDLY MULTIPLYING RODENTS NOW ARE THREATENING
1648-144971-0034 TO CONSUME EVERY PLANT ON THE ISLAND IF THE PLANTS DISAPPEAR MANY OF THE INSECTS WILL GO WITH THEM AND THIS WILL MEAN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE SMALL INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS
