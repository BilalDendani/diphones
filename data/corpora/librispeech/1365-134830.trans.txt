1365-134830-0000 THAT AT THE SINGLE WORD HE WAS A CONVICT NEARLY EVERY ONE DESERTED HIM IN LESS THAN TWO HOURS ALL THE GOOD THAT HE HAD DONE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN AND HE WAS NOTHING BUT A CONVICT FROM THE GALLEYS
1365-134830-0001 ALL DAY LONG CONVERSATIONS LIKE THE FOLLOWING WERE TO BE HEARD IN ALL QUARTERS OF THE TOWN YOU DON'T KNOW HE WAS A LIBERATED CONVICT WHO THE MAYOR
1365-134830-0002 YES REALLY HIS NAME WAS NOT MADELEINE AT ALL HE HAD A FRIGHTFUL NAME BEJEAN BOJEAN BOUJEAN AH GOOD GOD HE HAS BEEN ARRESTED ARRESTED IN PRISON IN THE CITY PRISON
1365-134830-0003 WHILE WAITING TO BE TRANSFERRED UNTIL HE IS TRANSFERRED HE IS TO BE TRANSFERRED WHERE IS HE TO BE TAKEN HE WILL BE TRIED AT THE ASSIZES FOR A HIGHWAY ROBBERY WHICH HE COMMITTED LONG AGO WELL I SUSPECTED AS MUCH
1365-134830-0004 THAT MAN WAS TOO GOOD TOO PERFECT TOO AFFECTED HE REFUSED THE CROSS HE BESTOWED SOUS ON ALL THE LITTLE SCAMPS HE CAME ACROSS
1365-134830-0005 EVIL HISTORY BACK OF ALL THAT THE DRAWING ROOMS PARTICULARLY ABOUNDED IN REMARKS OF THIS NATURE ONE OLD LADY A SUBSCRIBER TO THE DRAPEAU BLANC
1365-134830-0006 MADE THE FOLLOWING REMARK THE DEPTH OF WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FATHOM I AM NOT SORRY IT WILL BE A LESSON TO THE BONAPARTISTS
1365-134830-0007 ONLY THREE OR FOUR PERSONS IN ALL THE TOWN REMAINED FAITHFUL TO HIS MEMORY THE OLD PORTRESS WHO HAD SERVED HIM WAS AMONG THE NUMBER ON THE EVENING OF THAT DAY THE WORTHY OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING IN HER LODGE
1365-134830-0008 AND ABSORBED IN SAD REFLECTIONS THE FACTORY HAD BEEN CLOSED ALL DAY THE CARRIAGE GATE WAS BOLTED THE STREET WAS DESERTED THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE HOUSE BUT THE TWO NUNS
1365-134830-0009 AND THE FLAT CANDLESTICK WHICH HE USED EVERY EVENING TO GO UP TO HIS QUARTERS THEN SHE HUNG THE KEY ON THE NAIL WHENCE HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO TAKE IT AND SET THE CANDLESTICK ON ONE SIDE AS THOUGH SHE WAS EXPECTING HIM THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN ON HER CHAIR
1365-134830-0010 AT THAT MOMENT THE SMALL WINDOW IN THE LODGE OPENED A HAND PASSED THROUGH SEIZED THE KEY AND THE CANDLESTICK AND LIGHTED THE TAPER AT THE CANDLE WHICH WAS BURNING THERE THE PORTRESS RAISED HER EYES
1365-134830-0011 AND STOOD THERE WITH GAPING MOUTH AND A SHRIEK WHICH SHE CONFINED TO HER THROAT SHE KNEW THAT HAND THAT ARM THE SLEEVE OF THAT COAT
1365-134830-0012 IT WAS SEVERAL SECONDS BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK SHE HAD A SEIZURE AS SHE SAID HERSELF WHEN SHE RELATED THE ADVENTURE AFTERWARDS
1365-134830-0013 SHE CRIED AT LAST I THOUGHT YOU WERE SHE STOPPED THE CONCLUSION OF HER SENTENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN LACKING IN RESPECT TOWARDS THE BEGINNING JEAN VALJEAN WAS STILL MONSIEUR LE MAIRE TO HER HE FINISHED HER THOUGHT
1365-134830-0014 IN PRISON SAID HE I WAS THERE I BROKE A BAR OF ONE OF THE WINDOWS I LET MYSELF DROP FROM THE TOP OF A ROOF AND HERE I AM I AM GOING UP TO MY ROOM GO AND FIND SISTER SIMPLICE FOR ME
1365-134830-0015 SHE IS WITH THAT POOR WOMAN NO DOUBT THE OLD WOMAN OBEYED IN ALL HASTE HE GAVE HER NO ORDERS HE WAS QUITE SURE THAT SHE WOULD GUARD HIM BETTER THAN HE SHOULD GUARD HIMSELF
1365-134830-0016 NO ONE EVER FOUND OUT HOW HE HAD MANAGED TO GET INTO THE COURTYARD WITHOUT OPENING THE BIG GATES HE HAD AND ALWAYS CARRIED ABOUT HIM A PASS KEY WHICH OPENED A LITTLE SIDE DOOR BUT HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEARCHED AND HIS LATCH KEY MUST HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM
1365-134830-0017 THIS POINT WAS NEVER EXPLAINED HE ASCENDED THE STAIRCASE LEADING TO HIS CHAMBER ON ARRIVING AT THE TOP HE LEFT HIS CANDLE ON THE TOP STEP OF HIS STAIRS OPENED HIS DOOR WITH VERY LITTLE NOISE WENT AND CLOSED HIS WINDOW AND HIS SHUTTERS BY FEELING
1365-134830-0018 AND THE FORTY SOU PIECE WHICH HAD BEEN BLACKENED BY THE FIRE HE TOOK A SHEET OF PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE THESE ARE THE TWO TIPS OF MY IRON SHOD CUDGEL AND THE FORTY SOU PIECE STOLEN FROM LITTLE GERVAIS
1365-134830-0019 IN THE STRIPS OF LINEN THUS PREPARED HE WRAPPED THE TWO SILVER CANDLESTICKS HE BETRAYED NEITHER HASTE NOR AGITATION AND WHILE HE WAS WRAPPING UP THE BISHOP'S CANDLESTICKS HE NIBBLED AT A PIECE OF BLACK BREAD
1365-134830-0020 COME IN SAID HE IT WAS SISTER SIMPLICE SHE WAS PALE HER EYES WERE RED THE CANDLE WHICH SHE CARRIED TREMBLED IN HER HAND THE PECULIAR FEATURE OF THE VIOLENCES OF DESTINY IS
1365-134830-0021 JEAN VALJEAN HAD JUST FINISHED WRITING A FEW LINES ON A PAPER WHICH HE HANDED TO THE NUN SAYING SISTER
1365-134830-0022 THE PAPER WAS NOT FOLDED SHE CAST A GLANCE UPON IT YOU CAN READ IT SAID HE SHE READ
1365-134830-0023 HE WILL BE SO GOOD AS TO PAY OUT OF IT THE EXPENSES OF MY TRIAL AND OF THE FUNERAL OF THE WOMAN WHO DIED YESTERDAY THE REST IS FOR THE POOR THE SISTER TRIED TO SPEAK BUT SHE ONLY MANAGED
1365-134830-0024 TO STAMMER A FEW INARTICULATE SOUNDS SHE SUCCEEDED IN SAYING HOWEVER DOES NOT MONSIEUR LE MAIRE DESIRE TO TAKE A LAST LOOK AT THAT POOR UNHAPPY WOMAN NO SAID HE
1365-134830-0025 I AM PURSUED IT WOULD ONLY END IN THEIR ARRESTING ME IN THAT ROOM AND THAT WOULD DISTURB HER HE HAD HARDLY FINISHED WHEN A LOUD NOISE BECAME AUDIBLE ON THE STAIRCASE THEY HEARD A TUMULT OF ASCENDING FOOTSTEPS
1365-134830-0026 AND THE OLD PORTRESS SAYING IN HER LOUDEST AND MOST PIERCING TONES MY GOOD SIR
1365-134830-0027 NOR ALL THE EVENING AND THAT I HAVE NOT EVEN LEFT THE DOOR A MAN RESPONDED
1365-134830-0028 THEY RECOGNIZED JAVERT'S VOICE THE CHAMBER WAS SO ARRANGED THAT THE DOOR IN OPENING MASKED THE CORNER OF THE WALL ON THE RIGHT JEAN VALJEAN BLEW OUT THE LIGHT AND PLACED HIMSELF IN THIS ANGLE SISTER SIMPLICE FELL ON HER KNEES NEAR THE TABLE
1365-134830-0029 THE DOOR OPENED JAVERT ENTERED THE WHISPERS OF MANY MEN AND THE PROTESTATIONS OF THE PORTRESS WERE AUDIBLE IN THE CORRIDOR THE NUN DID NOT RAISE HER EYES SHE WAS PRAYING THE CANDLE WAS ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE
1365-134830-0030 JAVERT CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE NUN AND HALTED IN AMAZEMENT IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL POINT IN JAVERT HIS ELEMENT THE VERY AIR HE BREATHED WAS VENERATION FOR ALL AUTHORITY THIS WAS IMPREGNABLE
1365-134830-0031 AND ADMITTED OF NEITHER OBJECTION NOR RESTRICTION IN HIS EYES OF COURSE THE ECCLESIASTICAL AUTHORITY WAS THE CHIEF OF ALL HE WAS RELIGIOUS SUPERFICIAL AND CORRECT ON THIS POINT AS ON ALL OTHERS IN HIS EYES A PRIEST WAS A MIND
1365-134830-0032 WHO NEVER MAKES A MISTAKE A NUN WAS A CREATURE WHO NEVER SINS THEY WERE SOULS WALLED IN FROM THIS WORLD WITH A SINGLE DOOR WHICH NEVER OPENED EXCEPT TO ALLOW THE TRUTH TO PASS THROUGH ON PERCEIVING THE SISTER
1365-134830-0033 HIS FIRST MOVEMENT WAS TO RETIRE BUT THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER DUTY WHICH BOUND HIM AND IMPELLED HIM IMPERIOUSLY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION HIS SECOND MOVEMENT WAS TO REMAIN AND TO VENTURE ON AT LEAST ONE QUESTION
1365-134830-0034 THIS WAS SISTER SIMPLICE WHO HAD NEVER TOLD A LIE IN HER LIFE JAVERT KNEW IT AND HELD HER IN SPECIAL VENERATION IN CONSEQUENCE SISTER SAID HE ARE YOU ALONE IN THIS ROOM
1365-134830-0035 A TERRIBLE MOMENT ENSUED DURING WHICH THE POOR PORTRESS FELT AS THOUGH SHE SHOULD FAINT THE SISTER RAISED HER EYES AND ANSWERED YES THEN RESUMED JAVERT YOU WILL EXCUSE ME IF I PERSIST IT IS MY DUTY
1365-134830-0036 YOU HAVE NOT SEEN A CERTAIN PERSON A MAN THIS EVENING HE HAS ESCAPED WE ARE IN SEARCH OF HIM THAT JEAN VALJEAN YOU HAVE NOT SEEN HIM THE SISTER REPLIED NO SHE LIED
1365-134830-0037 O SAINTED MAID YOU LEFT THIS WORLD MANY YEARS AGO YOU HAVE REJOINED YOUR SISTERS THE VIRGINS AND YOUR BROTHERS THE ANGELS IN THE LIGHT MAY THIS LIE BE COUNTED TO YOUR CREDIT IN PARADISE THE SISTER'S AFFIRMATION WAS FOR JAVERT
1365-134830-0038 SO DECISIVE A THING THAT HE DID NOT EVEN OBSERVE THE SINGULARITY OF THAT CANDLE WHICH HAD BUT JUST BEEN EXTINGUISHED AND WHICH WAS STILL SMOKING ON THE TABLE AN HOUR LATER A MAN MARCHING AMID TREES AND MISTS
1365-134830-0039 THAT MAN WAS JEAN VALJEAN IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE TESTIMONY OF TWO OR THREE CARTERS WHO MET HIM THAT HE WAS CARRYING A BUNDLE THAT HE WAS DRESSED IN A BLOUSE WHERE HAD HE OBTAINED THAT BLOUSE NO ONE EVER FOUND OUT
1365-134830-0040 BUT AN AGED WORKMAN HAD DIED IN THE INFIRMARY OF THE FACTORY A FEW DAYS BEFORE LEAVING BEHIND HIM NOTHING BUT HIS BLOUSE PERHAPS THAT WAS THE ONE ONE LAST WORD ABOUT FANTINE WE ALL HAVE A MOTHER
1365-134830-0041 THE EARTH FANTINE WAS GIVEN BACK TO THAT MOTHER
1365-134830-0042 IN RESERVING AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE FROM WHAT JEAN VALJEAN HAD LEFT FOR THE POOR WHO WAS CONCERNED AFTER ALL A CONVICT AND A WOMAN OF THE TOWN THAT IS WHY HE HAD A VERY SIMPLE FUNERAL FOR FANTINE
1365-134830-0043 GOD KNOWS WHERE TO FIND THE SOUL AGAIN FANTINE WAS LAID IN THE SHADE AMONG THE FIRST BONES THAT CAME TO HAND SHE WAS SUBJECTED TO THE PROMISCUOUSNESS OF ASHES SHE WAS THROWN INTO THE PUBLIC GRAVE
