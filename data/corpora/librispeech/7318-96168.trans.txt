7318-96168-0000 I WAS AT THE ONE CALLED IN THE CHART SADDLE HILL THE SMALLEST OF THEM I THINK AND SELDOM HAVE I HAD SUCH SENSATIONS OF PEACE AS I LAY A WHOLE BURNING DAY IN A RISING VALE DEEPLY SHADED IN PALM AND TROPICAL RANKNESSES
7318-96168-0001 AND THE SEA AS ABSOLUTELY CALM AS A LAKE ROUGHENED WITH BREEZES YET MAKING A CONSIDERABLE NOISE IN ITS BREAKING ON THE SHORE AS I HAVE NOTICED IN THESE SORTS OF PLACES I DO NOT KNOW WHY
7318-96168-0002 NEARLY SKELETONS YET WITH LIMBS AND VERTEBRAE STILL IN GENERAL COHERING AND IN SOME CASES DRY SKINNED AND MUMMIFIED RELICS OF FLESH AND NEVER ANYWHERE A SIGN OF CLOTHES
7318-96168-0003 SO THAT THEY WERE EAGER FOLK AND THE WAYWARD DARK EARTH WAS IN THEM TOO AS SHE SHOULD BE IN HER CHILDREN THEY HAD IN MANY CASES SOME REDDISH DISCOLORATION WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN THE TRACES OF BETEL NUT STAINS FOR BETEL NUTS ABOUND THERE AND I WAS SO PLEASED WITH THESE PEOPLE
7318-96168-0004 THAT I TOOK ON BOARD WITH THE GIG ONE OF THEIR LITTLE TREE CANOES WHICH WAS MY FOOLISHNESS FOR GIG AND CANOE WERE ONLY THREE NIGHTS LATER WASHED FROM THE DECKS INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE SEA I PASSED DOWN THE STRAITS OF MALACCA AND IN THAT SHORT DISTANCE BETWEEN THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS
7318-96168-0005 WAS THE UNLOOSENING AFRESH OF ALL MY EVIL PASSION FOR I SAID SINCE THEY MEAN TO SLAY ME DEATH SHALL FIND ME REBELLIOUS AND FOR WEEKS I COULD NOT SIGHT SOME SPECIALLY HAPPY VILLAGE OR UMBRAGEOUS SPREAD OF WOODLAND
7318-96168-0006 THAT I DID NOT STOP THE SHIP AND LAND THE MATERIALS FOR THEIR DESTRUCTION SO THAT NEARLY ALL THOSE SPICY LANDS ABOUT THE NORTH OF AUSTRALIA WILL BEAR THE TRACES OF MY HAND FOR MANY A YEAR FOR MORE AND MORE MY VOYAGE BECAME DAWDLING AND ZIGZAGED
7318-96168-0007 AS THE MEREST WHIM DIRECTED IT OR THE MOVEMENT OF THE POINTER ON THE CHART AND I THOUGHT OF EATING THE LOTUS OF SURCEASE AND NEPENTHE IN SOME ENCHANTED NOOK OF THIS BOWERING SUMMER
7318-96168-0008 YEAR AFTER YEAR AND WONDER WHAT SHE WAS AND WHENCE AND WHY SHE DOZED SO DEEP FOR EVER AND AFTER AN AGE OF MELANCHOLY PEACE AND BURDENED BLISS I SHOULD NOTE THAT SUN AND MOON HAD CEASED REVOLVING AND HUNG INERT
7318-96168-0009 OPENING ANON A HEAVY LID TO DOZE AND DROWSE AGAIN AND GOD WOULD SIGH ENOUGH AND NOD AND BEING WOULD SWOON TO SLEEP FOR THAT ANY OLD CHINAMAN SHOULD BE ALIVE IN PEKIN
7318-96168-0010 WAS A THING SO FANTASTICALLY MANIAC AS TO DRAW FROM ME AT TIMES SUDDEN FITS OF WILD RED LAUGHTER THAT LEFT ME FAINT DURING A SPACE OF FOUR MONTHS FROM THE EIGHTEENTH JUNE TO THE TWENTY THIRD OCTOBER
7318-96168-0011 I VISITED THE FIJIS WHERE I SAW SKULLS STILL SURROUNDED WITH REMNANTS OF EXTRAORDINARY HALOES OF STIFF HAIR WOMEN CLAD IN GIRDLES MADE OF THONGS FIXED IN A BELT AND IN SAMOA NEAR BODIES CROWNED WITH CORONETS OF NAUTILUS SHELL
7318-96168-0012 AND TRACES OF TURMERIC PAINT AND TATTOOING AND IN ONE TOWNLET A GREAT ASSEMBLAGE OF CARCASSES
7318-96168-0013 THE PEOPLE OF NEW CALEDONIA ON THE OTHER HAND WENT I SHOULD THINK NAKED CONFINING THEIR ATTENTION TO THE HAIR AND IN THIS RESEMBLING THE FIJIANS FOR THEY SEEMED TO WEAR AN ARTIFICIAL HAIR MADE OF THE FUR OF SOME CREATURE LIKE A BAT
7318-96168-0014 AND ALSO THEY WORE WOODEN MASKS AND GREAT RINGS FOR THE EAR NO DOUBT WHICH MUST HAVE FALLEN TO THE SHOULDERS FOR THE EARTH WAS IN THEM ALL AND MADE THEM WILD PERVERSE AND VARIOUS LIKE HERSELF I WENT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER WITHOUT ANY SYSTEM WHATEVER
7318-96168-0015 A SMALL SEMICIRCLE OF SPERANZA GOLD PLATE BEFORE ME AND NEAR ABOVE ME THE RED SHADED LAMP WITH GREEN CONICAL RESERVOIR WHOSE CREAKINGS NEVER CEASE IN THE STILLEST MID SEA
7318-96168-0016 AND BEYOND THE PLATES THE ARRAY OF PRESERVED SOUPS MEAT EXTRACTS MEATS FRUIT SWEETS WINES NUTS LIQUEURS COFFEE ON THE SILVER SPIRIT TRIPOD GLASSES CRUET AND SO ON
7318-96168-0017 WHICH IT WAS ALWAYS MY FIRST CARE TO SELECT FROM THE STORE ROOM OPEN AND LAY OUT ONCE FOR ALL IN THE MORNING ON RISING I WAS LATE SEVEN BEING MY HOUR FOR ON THAT DAY I HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN THE OCCASIONALLY NECESSARY BUT ALWAYS DEFERRED TASK OF OVERHAULING THE SHIP
7318-96168-0018 BRUSHING HERE A ROPE WITH TAR THERE A BOARD WITH PAINT THERE A CRANK WITH OIL RUBBING A DOOR HANDLE A BRASS FITTING FILLING THE THREE CABIN LAMPS DUSTING MIRRORS AND FURNITURE DASHING THE GREAT NEAT JOINERED PLAINS OF DECK WITH BUCKETFULLS
7318-96168-0019 OR HIGH IN AIR CHOPPING LOOSE WITH ITS RIGGING THE MIZZEN TOP MAST WHICH SINCE A MONTH WAS SPRAINED AT THE CLAMPS ALL THIS IN COTTON DRAWERS UNDER LOOSE QUAMIS BARE FOOTED MY BEARD KNOTTED UP THE SUN A BLAZE
7318-96168-0020 THE SEA SMOOTH AND PALE WITH THE SMOOTH PALLOR OF STRONG CURRENTS THE SHIP STILL ENOUGH NO LAND IN SIGHT YET GREAT TRACTS OF SEA WEED MAKING EASTWARD
7318-96168-0021 FOR I WISHED TO HAVE IT ALL OVER IN ONE OBNOXIOUS DAY I WAS THEREFORE VERY TIRED WHEN I WENT DOWN LIT THE CENTRAL CHAIN LEVER LAMP AND MY OWN TWO WASHED AND DRESSED IN MY BEDROOM AND SAT TO DINNER IN THE DINING HALL CORNER
7318-96168-0022 I ATE VORACIOUSLY WITH SWEAT AS USUAL POURING DOWN MY EAGER BROW USING KNIFE OR SPOON IN THE RIGHT HAND BUT NEVER THE WESTERN FORK LICKING THE PLATES CLEAN IN THE MOHAMMEDAN MANNER AND DRINKING PRETTY FREELY
7318-96168-0023 STILL I WAS TIRED AND WENT UPON DECK WHERE I HAD THE THREADBARE BLUE VELVET EASY CHAIR WITH THE BROKEN LEFT ARM BEFORE THE WHEEL
7318-96168-0024 HALF ASLEEP YET CONSCIOUS THE MOON CAME UP INTO A PRETTY CLOUDLESS SKY AND SHE WAS BRIGHT BUT NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH TO OUT SHINE THE ENLIGHTENED FLIGHT OF THE OCEAN WHICH THAT NIGHT WAS ONE CONTINUOUS SWAMP OF JACK O' LANTERN PHOSPHORESCENCE
7318-96168-0025 A WILD BUT FAINT LUMINOSITY MINGLED WITH STARS AND FLASHES OF BRILLIANCE THE WHOLE TROOPING UNANIMOUSLY EASTWARD AS IF IN HASTE WITH ELFIN MOMENTOUS PURPOSE A BOUNDLESS CONGREGATION IN THE SWEEP OF A STRONG OCEANIC CURRENT
7318-96168-0026 PROBABLY AT THE RATE OF FOUR TO SIX KNOTS BUT I DID NOT CARE KNOWING VERY WELL THAT NO LAND WAS WITHIN TWO HUNDRED MILES OF MY BOWS
7318-96168-0027 AND AFTER A TIME THE CIGAR DROOPED AND DROPPED FROM MY MOUTH AND SLEEP OVERCAME ME AND I SLEPT THERE IN THE LAP OF THE INFINITE SO THAT SOMETHING PRESERVES ME SOMETHING SOMEONE AND FOR WHAT
7318-96168-0028 AND BEGUMS WITH SPANGLED TRAINS AND ALL THE AIR FRAGRANT WITH THAT MORTAL SCENT AND HIGH AND WIDE UPLIFTED BEFORE ME STRETCHING FROM THE NORTHERN TO THE SOUTHERN LIMIT
7318-96168-0029 A ROW OF EIGHT OR NINE INFLAMED SMOKES AS FROM THE CHIMNEYS OF SOME CYCLOPEAN FOUNDRY A WORK ALL NIGHT MOST SOLEMN MOST GREAT AND DREADFUL IN THE SOLEMN NIGHT
7318-96168-0030 AND SPARKS AND FLASHES ALL VEILED IN A GARISH HAZE OF LIGHT FOR THE FOUNDRY WORKED THOUGH LANGUIDLY AND UPON A ROCKY LAND FOUR MILES AHEAD WHICH NO CHART HAD EVER MARKED
7318-96168-0031 THE SPERANZA DROVE STRAIGHT WITH THE CURRENT OF THE PHOSPHORUS SEA AS I ROSE I FELL FLAT AND WHAT I DID THEREAFTER I DID IN A STATE OF EXISTENCE WHOSE ACTS TO THE WAKING MIND APPEAR UNREAL AS DREAM
7318-96168-0032 I MUST AT ONCE I THINK HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS THAT HERE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE DESTRUCTION OF MANKIND THAT IT STILL SURROUNDED ITS OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD WITH POISONOUS FUMES AND THAT I WAS APPROACHING IT I MUST HAVE SOMEHOW CRAWLED
7318-96168-0033 OR DRAGGED MYSELF FORWARD THERE IS AN IMPRESSION ON MY MIND THAT IT WAS A PURPLE LAND OF PURE PORPHYRY THERE IS SOME FAINT MEMORY OR DREAM OF HEARING A LONG DRAWN BOOMING OF WAVES UPON ITS CRAGS I DO NOT KNOW WHENCE I HAVE THEM
7318-96168-0034 AND I MUST HAVE BEEN BACK TO UNTIE THE WHEEL IN GOOD TIME FOR WHEN MY SENSES CAME I WAS LYING THERE MY HEAD AGAINST THE UNDER GIMBAL ONE FOOT ON A SPOKE OF THE WHEEL NO LAND IN SIGHT AND MORNING BREAKING
7318-96168-0035 AND ON THE MORNING WHEN I FINALLY ROUSED MYSELF I DID NOT KNOW WHETHER IT WAS THE SECOND OR THE THIRD MORNING SO THAT MY CALENDAR SO SCRUPULOUSLY KEPT MAY BE A DAY OUT
7318-96168-0036 FOR TO THIS DAY I HAVE NEVER BEEN AT THE PAINS TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER I AM HERE WRITING NOW ON THE FIFTH OR THE SIXTH OF JUNE WELL ON THE FOURTH OR THE FIFTH EVENING AFTER THIS JUST AS THE SUN WAS SINKING BEYOND THE RIM OF THE SEA
7318-96168-0037 WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF MAST HEAVILY WATER LOGGED SOME RELICS OF OLD RIGGING HANGING OVER EVEN HER BOWSPRIT APPARENTLY BROKEN IN THE MIDDLE THOUGH I COULD NOT SEE IT AND SHE NOTHING MORE THAN A HIRSUTE GREEN MASS OF OLD WEEDS AND SEA THINGS
7318-96168-0038 FROM BOWSPRIT TIP TO POOP AND FROM BULWARKS TO WATER LINE STOUT AS A HEDGEHOG ONLY AWAITING THERE THE NEXT HIGH SEA TO FOUNDER IT BEING NEAR MY DINNER HOUR AND NIGHT'S REST I STOPPED THE SPERANZA SOME FIFTEEN YARDS FROM HER
7318-96168-0039 THEIR AGE AND THOUGHT AND WAY OF LIFE AND BEARDS TILL THE DESIRE AROSE WITHIN ME TO GO TO HER AND SEE AND I THREW OFF MY OUTER GARMENTS UNCOVERED AND UNROPED THE CEDAR CUTTER THE ONLY BOAT EXCEPT THE AIR PINNACE LEFT TO ME INTACT
7318-96168-0040 AND GOT HER DOWN BY THE MIZZEN FIVE BLOCK PULLEY SYSTEM BUT IT WAS A RIDICULOUS NONSENSE FOR HAVING PADDLED TO HER I WAS THROWN INTO PAROXYSMS OF RAGE BY REPEATED FAILURES TO SCALE HER BULWARKS LOW AS THEY WERE MY HANDS INDEED COULD REACH
7318-96168-0041 OF WHICH I HAD PLENTY TO BLOW HER TO UTTERMOST HELL I HAD TO RETURN TO THE SPERANZA GET A HALF INCH ROPE THEN BACK TO THE OTHER FOR I WOULD NOT BE BAULKED IN SUCH A WAY THOUGH NOW THE DARK WAS COME ONLY SLIGHTLY TEMPERED BY A HALF MOON AND I GETTING HUNGRY
7318-96168-0042 AND FROM MINUTE TO MINUTE MORE FIENDISHLY FEROCIOUS FINALLY BY DINT OF THROWING I GOT THE ROPE LOOP ROUND A MAST STUMP DREW MYSELF UP AND MADE FAST THE BOAT MY LEFT HAND CUT BY SOME CURSED SHELL AND ALL FOR WHAT
7318-96168-0043 HERE I EXPERIENCED A SINGULAR GHOSTLY AWE AND TIMOROUSNESS LEST SHE SHOULD SINK WITH ME OR SOMETHING BUT STRIKING MATCHES I SAW AN ORDINARY CABIN WITH SOME FUNGOIDS SKULLS BONES AND RAGS BUT NOT ONE COHERING SKELETON
7318-96168-0044 IN THE SECOND STARBOARD BERTH WAS A SMALL TABLE AND ON THE FLOOR A THICK ROUND INK POT WHOSE CONTINUAL ROLLING ON ITS SIDE MADE ME LOOK DOWN AND THERE I SAW A FLAT SQUARE BOOK WITH BLACK COVERS WHICH CURVED HALF OPEN OF ITSELF FOR IT HAD BEEN WET AND STAINED
7318-96168-0045 THIS I TOOK AND WENT BACK TO THE SPERANZA FOR THAT SHIP WAS NOTHING BUT AN EMPTINESS AND A STENCH OF THE CRUDE ELEMENTS OF LIFE NEARLY ASSIMILATED NOW TO THE RANK DEEP TO WHICH SHE WAS WEDDED AND SOON TO BE ABSORBED INTO ITS NATURE
7318-96168-0046 AND BEING TO BECOME A SEA IN LITTLE AS I IN TIME MY GOD SHALL BE NOTHING BUT AN EARTH IN LITTLE DURING DINNER AND AFTER I READ THE BOOK WITH SOME DIFFICULTY FOR IT WAS PEN WRITTEN IN FRENCH AND DISCOLOURED
7318-96168-0047 AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE JOURNAL OF SOMEONE A PASSENGER AND VOYAGER I IMAGINE WHO CALLED HIMSELF ALBERT TISSU AND THE SHIP THE MARIE MEYER
7318-96168-0048 I SUPPOSE IN THE EVENING FOR HE DOES NOT SAY AND HE WRITES MONSTROUS EVENT PHENOMENON WITHOUT LIKENESS THE WITNESSES OF WHICH MUST FOR EVER LIVE IMMORTALISED IN THE ANNALS OF THE UNIVERSE AN EVENT WHICH WILL MAKE EVEN MAMA HENRI
7318-96168-0049 AND JULIETTE ADMIT THAT I WAS JUSTIFIED IN UNDERTAKING THIS MOST EVENTFUL VOYAGE TALKING WITH CAPTAIN TOMBAREL ON THE POOP WHEN A SUDDEN EXCLAMATION FROM HIM MON DIEU HIS VISAGE WHITENS
7318-96168-0050 BUT TEN HEWN PILLARS OF WATER WITH UNIFORM DIAMETER FROM TOP TO BOTTOM ONLY A LITTLE TWISTED HERE AND THERE AND AS I DIVINE FIFTY METRES IN GIRTH FIVE TEN STUPENDOUS MINUTES WE LOOK
7318-96168-0051 DOUBTLESS STILL THERE CAN NO MORE BE SEEN FOR THE OCEAN ALL ABOUT THEM IS STEAMING HISSING HIGHER THAN THE PILLARS A DENSE WHITE VAPOUR VAST IN EXTENT WHOSE VENOMOUS SIBILATION WE AT THIS DISTANCE CAN QUITE DISTINCTLY HEAR
7318-96168-0052 IT IS AFFRIGHTING IT IS INTOLERABLE THE EYES CAN HARDLY BEAR TO WATCH THE EARS TO HEAR IT SEEMS UNHOLY TRAVAIL MONSTROUS BIRTH BUT IT LASTS NOT LONG ALL AT ONCE THE MARIE MEYER COMMENCES
7318-96168-0053 TO PITCH AND ROLL VIOLENTLY AND THE SEA A MOMENT SINCE CALM IS NOW ROUGH AND AT THE SAME TIME THROUGH THE WHITE VAPOUR WE SEE A DARK SHADOW SLOWLY RISING
7318-96168-0054 THE SHADOW OF A MIGHTY BACK A NEW BORN LAND BEARING UPWARDS TEN FLAMES OF FIRE SLOWLY STEADILY OUT OF THE SEA INTO THE CLOUDS
7318-96168-0055 AT THE MOMENT WHEN THAT SUBLIME EMERGENCE CEASES OR SEEMS TO CEASE THE GRAND THOUGHT THAT SMITES ME IS THIS I ALBERT TISSU AM IMMORTALISED MY NAME SHALL NEVER PERISH FROM AMONG MEN I RUSH DOWN I WRITE IT
