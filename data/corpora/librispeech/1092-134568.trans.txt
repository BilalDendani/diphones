1092-134568-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE NEXT IMPORTANT STEP IN MY EDUCATION WAS LEARNING TO READ AS SOON AS I COULD SPELL A FEW WORDS MY TEACHER GAVE ME SLIPS OF CARDBOARD ON WHICH WERE PRINTED WORDS IN RAISED LETTERS
1092-134568-0001 I QUICKLY LEARNED THAT EACH PRINTED WORD STOOD FOR AN OBJECT AN ACT OR A QUALITY I HAD A FRAME IN WHICH I COULD ARRANGE THE WORDS IN LITTLE SENTENCES
1092-134568-0002 AND AT THE SAME TIME CARRYING OUT THE IDEA OF THE SENTENCE WITH THE THINGS THEMSELVES ONE DAY MISS SULLIVAN TELLS ME I PINNED THE WORD GIRL ON MY PINAFORE AND STOOD IN THE WARDROBE ON THE SHELF I ARRANGED THE WORDS IS
1092-134568-0003 IN WARDROBE NOTHING DELIGHTED ME SO MUCH AS THIS GAME
1092-134568-0004 OFTEN EVERYTHING IN THE ROOM WAS ARRANGED IN OBJECT SENTENCES FROM THE PRINTED SLIP IT WAS BUT A STEP TO THE PRINTED BOOK I TOOK MY READER FOR BEGINNERS AND HUNTED FOR THE WORDS I KNEW
1092-134568-0005 WHEN I FOUND THEM MY JOY WAS LIKE THAT OF A GAME OF HIDE AND SEEK THUS I BEGAN TO READ OF THE TIME WHEN I BEGAN TO READ CONNECTED STORIES I SHALL SPEAK LATER FOR A LONG TIME I HAD NO REGULAR LESSONS
1092-134568-0006 EVEN WHEN I STUDIED MOST EARNESTLY IT SEEMED MORE LIKE PLAY THAN WORK EVERYTHING MISS SULLIVAN TAUGHT ME SHE ILLUSTRATED BY A BEAUTIFUL STORY OR A POEM WHENEVER ANYTHING DELIGHTED OR INTERESTED ME
1092-134568-0007 SHE TALKED IT OVER WITH ME JUST AS IF SHE WERE A LITTLE GIRL HERSELF WHAT MANY CHILDREN THINK OF WITH DREAD AS A PAINFUL PLODDING THROUGH GRAMMAR HARD SUMS AND HARDER DEFINITIONS IS TO DAY ONE OF MY MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES
1092-134568-0008 I CANNOT EXPLAIN THE PECULIAR SYMPATHY MISS SULLIVAN HAD WITH MY PLEASURES AND DESIRES PERHAPS IT WAS THE RESULT OF LONG ASSOCIATION WITH THE BLIND ADDED TO THIS SHE HAD A WONDERFUL FACULTY FOR DESCRIPTION SHE WENT QUICKLY OVER UNINTERESTING DETAILS
1092-134568-0009 AND NEVER NAGGED ME WITH QUESTIONS TO SEE IF I REMEMBERED THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY'S LESSON SHE INTRODUCED DRY TECHNICALITIES OF SCIENCE LITTLE BY LITTLE MAKING EVERY SUBJECT SO REAL THAT I COULD NOT HELP REMEMBERING WHAT SHE TAUGHT
1092-134568-0010 WE READ AND STUDIED OUT OF DOORS PREFERRING THE SUNLIT WOODS TO THE HOUSE ALL MY EARLY LESSONS HAVE IN THEM THE BREATH OF THE WOODS THE FINE RESINOUS ODOUR OF PINE NEEDLES BLENDED WITH THE PERFUME OF WILD GRAPES
1092-134568-0011 LITTLE DOWNY CHICKENS AND WILDFLOWERS THE DOGWOOD BLOSSOMS MEADOW VIOLETS AND BUDDING FRUIT TREES
1092-134568-0012 AH ME HOW WELL I REMEMBER THE SPICY CLOVERY SMELL OF HIS BREATH
1092-134568-0013 FEW KNOW WHAT JOY IT IS TO FEEL THE ROSES PRESSING SOFTLY INTO THE HAND
1092-134568-0014 SOMETIMES I CAUGHT AN INSECT IN THE FLOWER I WAS PLUCKING AND I FELT THE FAINT NOISE OF A PAIR OF WINGS RUBBED TOGETHER IN A SUDDEN TERROR AS THE LITTLE CREATURE BECAME AWARE OF A PRESSURE FROM WITHOUT
1092-134568-0015 PRESSED MY FACE AGAINST THE SMOOTH CHEEKS OF THE APPLES STILL WARM FROM THE SUN AND SKIPPED BACK TO THE HOUSE OUR FAVOURITE WALK WAS TO KELLER'S LANDING AN OLD TUMBLEDOWN LUMBER WHARF ON THE TENNESSEE RIVER USED DURING THE CIVIL WAR TO LAND SOLDIERS
1092-134568-0016 THERE WE SPENT MANY HAPPY HOURS AND PLAYED AT LEARNING GEOGRAPHY I BUILT DAMS OF PEBBLES MADE ISLANDS AND LAKES AND DUG RIVER BEDS ALL FOR FUN AND NEVER DREAMED THAT I WAS LEARNING A LESSON I LISTENED WITH INCREASING WONDER
1092-134568-0017 TO MISS SULLIVAN'S DESCRIPTIONS OF THE GREAT ROUND WORLD WITH ITS BURNING MOUNTAINS BURIED CITIES MOVING RIVERS OF ICE AND MANY OTHER THINGS AS STRANGE SHE MADE RAISED MAPS IN CLAY SO THAT I COULD FEEL THE MOUNTAIN RIDGES AND VALLEYS
1092-134568-0018 AND FOLLOW WITH MY FINGERS THE DEVIOUS COURSE OF RIVERS I LIKED THIS TOO
1092-134568-0019 INTO ZONES AND POLES CONFUSED AND TEASED MY MIND
1092-134568-0020 SUGGESTS A SERIES OF TWINE CIRCLES AND I BELIEVE THAT IF ANY ONE SHOULD SET ABOUT IT HE COULD CONVINCE ME THAT WHITE BEARS ACTUALLY CLIMB THE NORTH POLE
1092-134568-0021 FROM THE FIRST I WAS NOT INTERESTED IN THE SCIENCE OF NUMBERS MISS SULLIVAN TRIED TO TEACH ME TO COUNT BY STRINGING BEADS IN GROUPS AND BY ARRANGING KINTERGARTEN STRAWS I LEARNED TO ADD AND SUBTRACT
1092-134568-0022 I STUDIED ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY ONCE A GENTLEMAN WHOSE NAME I HAVE FORGOTTEN SENT ME A COLLECTION OF FOSSILS TINY MOLLUSK SHELLS BEAUTIFULLY MARKED
1092-134568-0023 AND A LOVELY FERN IN BAS RELIEF THESE WERE THE KEYS WHICH UNLOCKED THE TREASURES OF THE ANTEDILUVIAN WORLD FOR ME WITH TREMBLING FINGERS I LISTENED TO MISS SULLIVAN'S DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TERRIBLE BEASTS WITH UNCOUTH UNPRONOUNCEABLE NAMES
1092-134568-0024 TEARING DOWN THE BRANCHES OF GIGANTIC TREES FOR FOOD AND DIED IN THE DISMAL SWAMPS OF AN UNKNOWN AGE FOR A LONG TIME THESE STRANGE CREATURES HAUNTED MY DREAMS AND THIS GLOOMY PERIOD FORMED A SOMBER BACKGROUND TO THE JOYOUS NOW
1092-134568-0025 FILLED WITH SUNSHINE AND ROSES AND ECHOING WITH THE GENTLE BEAT OF MY PONY'S HOOF ANOTHER TIME A BEAUTIFUL SHELL WAS GIVEN ME AND WITH A CHILD'S SURPRISE AND DELIGHT I LEARNED HOW A TINY MOLLUSK HAD BUILT THE LUSTROUS COIL FOR HIS DWELLING PLACE
1092-134568-0026 AND HOW ON STILL NIGHTS WHEN THERE IS NO BREEZE STIRRING THE WAVES THE NAUTILUS SAILS ON THE BLUE WATERS OF THE INDIAN OCEAN IN HIS SHIP OF PEARL
1092-134568-0027 JUST AS THE WONDER WORKING MANTLE OF THE NAUTILUS CHANGES THE MATERIAL IT ABSORBS FROM THE WATER AND MAKES IT A PART OF ITSELF SO THE BITS OF KNOWLEDGE ONE GATHERS UNDERGO A SIMILAR CHANGE AND BECOME PEARLS OF THOUGHT AGAIN IT WAS THE GROWTH OF A PLANT THAT FURNISHED THE TEXT
1092-134568-0028 FOR A LESSON WE BOUGHT A LILY AND SET IT IN A SUNNY WINDOW VERY SOON THE GREEN POINTED BUDS SHOWED SIGNS OF OPENING THE SLENDER FINGERLIKE LEAVES ON THE OUTSIDE OPENED SLOWLY RELUCTANT I THOUGHT
1092-134568-0029 ONCE HAVING MADE A START HOWEVER THE OPENING PROCESS WENT ON RAPIDLY BUT IN ORDER AND SYSTEMATICALLY THERE WAS ALWAYS ONE BUD LARGER AND MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE REST WHICH PUSHED HER OUTER COVERING BACK WITH MORE POMP
1092-134568-0030 AS IF THE BEAUTY IN SOFT SILKY ROBES KNEW THAT SHE WAS THE LILY QUEEN BY RIGHT DIVINE WHILE HER MORE TIMID SISTERS DOFFED THEIR GREEN HOODS SHYLY UNTIL THE WHOLE PLANT WAS ONE NODDING BOUGH OF LOVELINESS AND FRAGRANCE
1092-134568-0031 AND FEEL THE TADPOLES FRISK ABOUT AND TO LET THEM SLIP AND SLIDE BETWEEN MY FINGERS ONE DAY A MORE AMBITIOUS FELLOW LEAPED BEYOND THE EDGE OF THE BOWL AND FELL ON THE FLOOR WHERE I FOUND HIM TO ALL APPEARANCE MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE
1092-134568-0032 THE ONLY SIGN OF LIFE WAS A SLIGHT WRIGGLING OF HIS TAIL BUT NO SOONER HAD HE RETURNED TO HIS ELEMENT THAN HE DARTED TO THE BOTTOM SWIMMING ROUND AND ROUND IN JOYOUS ACTIVITY HE HAD MADE HIS LEAP HE HAD SEEN THE GREAT WORLD
1092-134568-0033 AND WAS CONTENT TO STAY IN HIS PRETTY GLASS HOUSE UNDER THE BIG FUCHSIA TREE UNTIL HE ATTAINED THE DIGNITY OF FROGHOOD THEN HE WENT TO LIVE IN THE LEAFY POOL AT THE END OF THE GARDEN WHERE HE MADE THE SUMMER NIGHTS MUSICAL WITH HIS QUAINT LOVE SONG
1092-134568-0034 THUS I LEARNED FROM LIFE ITSELF AT THE BEGINNING I WAS ONLY A LITTLE MASS OF POSSIBILITIES IT WAS MY TEACHER WHO UNFOLDED AND DEVELOPED THEM WHEN SHE CAME EVERYTHING ABOUT ME BREATHED OF LOVE AND JOY AND WAS FULL OF MEANING
1092-134568-0035 SHE HAS NEVER SINCE LET PASS AN OPPORTUNITY TO POINT OUT THE BEAUTY THAT IS IN EVERYTHING NOR HAS SHE CEASED
1092-134568-0036 IT WAS MY TEACHER'S GENIUS HER QUICK SYMPATHY HER LOVING TACT
1092-134568-0037 THAT MADE IT SO PLEASANT AND ACCEPTABLE TO ME SHE REALIZED THAT A CHILD'S MIND IS LIKE A SHALLOW BROOK WHICH RIPPLES AND DANCES MERRILY OVER THE STONY COURSE OF ITS EDUCATION AND REFLECTS HERE A FLOWER THERE A BUSH YONDER A FLEECY CLOUD
1092-134568-0038 AND SHE ATTEMPTED TO GUIDE MY MIND ON ITS WAY KNOWING THAT LIKE A BROOK IT SHOULD BE FED BY MOUNTAIN STREAMS AND HIDDEN SPRINGS UNTIL IT BROADENED OUT INTO A DEEP RIVER CAPABLE OF REFLECTING IN ITS PLACID SURFACE
1092-134568-0039 BILLOWY HILLS THE LUMINOUS SHADOWS OF TREES AND THE BLUE HEAVENS AS WELL AS THE SWEET FACE OF A LITTLE FLOWER ANY TEACHER CAN TAKE A CHILD TO THE CLASSROOM BUT NOT EVERY TEACHER CAN MAKE HIM LEARN
1092-134568-0040 HE WILL NOT WORK JOYOUSLY UNLESS HE FEELS THAT LIBERTY IS HIS WHETHER HE IS BUSY OR AT REST HE MUST FEEL THE FLUSH OF VICTORY AND THE HEART SINKING OF DISAPPOINTMENT BEFORE HE TAKES WITH A WILL
1092-134568-0041 THE TASKS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND RESOLVES TO DANCE HIS WAY BRAVELY THROUGH A DULL ROUTINE OF TEXTBOOKS MY TEACHER IS SO NEAR TO ME THAT I SCARCELY THINK OF MYSELF APART FROM HER
