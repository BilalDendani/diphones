6077-56146-0000 WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY BROADLY SPEAKING WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY IS ANY METHOD OF TRANSMITTING INTELLIGIBLE SIGNALS TO A DISTANCE WITHOUT WIRES
6077-56146-0001 SUCH AS FLAGS AND LONG ARMS OF WOOD BY DAY AND LIGHTS BY NIGHT ALSO THE HELIOGRAPH AN APPARATUS FOR FLASHING SUNLIGHT AND SOUND SIGNALS MADE EITHER THROUGH THE AIR OR WATER ELECTRICAL CONDUCTION
6077-56146-0002 EITHER THROUGH RAREFIED AIR OR THE EARTH ALSO COMES UNDER THIS HEADING THE NAME WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY HOWEVER IS SPECIFICALLY APPLIED TO A SYSTEM OF SIGNALING BY MEANS OF ETHER WAVES
6077-56146-0003 INDUCED BY ELECTRICAL DISCHARGES OF VERY HIGH VOLTAGE ETHER WAVES OF A GREATER OR LESS DEGREE ARE ALWAYS SET UP WHENEVER THERE ARE SUDDEN ELECTRICAL DISTURBANCES HOWEVER SLIGHT
6077-56146-0004 ETHER WAVES ELECTRICALLY INDUCED ARE PROBABLY AS OLD AS THE UNIVERSE WHEN THERE WERE THUNDERS AND LIGHTNINGS FROM THE CLOUD THAT HOVERED OVER MOUNT SINAI IN THE TIME OF MOSES ETHER WAVES OF GREAT POWER
6077-56146-0005 WERE SENT OUT THROUGH THE CAMP OF ISRAEL BUT THE PEOPLE OF THOSE DAYS HAD NO COHERER OR TELEPHONE OR ANY OTHER MEANS OF CONVERTING THESE WAVES INTO VISUAL OR AUDIBLE SIGNALS THOUSANDS OF YEARS HAD TO ELAPSE BEFORE THE INTELLECT OF MAN
6077-56146-0006 COULD GRASP THE MEANING OF THESE NATURAL PHENOMENA SUFFICIENTLY TO HARNESS THEM AND MAKE THEM SUBSERVIENT TO HIS WILL MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN POWERFULLY SHOCKED SOME EVEN KILLED BY THE IMPACT OF ETHER WAVES
6077-56146-0007 SET UP BY POWERFUL DISCHARGES OF LIGHTNING BETWEEN THE CLOUDS AND THE EARTH WHEN THEY WERE NOT IN THE DIRECT PATH OF THE LIGHTNING STROKE THE HISTORY OF ELECTRO WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY LIKE THAT OF ALL INVENTIONS
6077-56146-0008 IS ONE OF SUCCESSIVE STAGES AND ALL THE WORK WAS NOT DONE BY ONE MAN THE ONE WHO GETS THE MOST CREDIT IS USUALLY THE ONE WHO PUTS ON THE FINISHING TOUCHES AND BRINGS IT OUT BEFORE THE PUBLIC HE MAY HAVE DONE MUCH TOWARD ITS DEVELOPMENT
6077-56146-0009 BY CONDUCTION THROUGH WATER IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE JOSEPH HENRY PRODUCED AN EFFECT ON A GALVANOMETER BY ETHER WAVES THROUGH A DISTANCE OF TWENTY FEET BY AN ARRANGEMENT OF BATTERIES AND CIRCUITS LIKE THAT SHOWN IN FIG ONE
6077-56146-0010 FROM THE PRIMARY TO THE SECONDARY COIL BUT THROUGH VERY SHORT DISTANCES IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY PROFESSOR TROWBRIDGE TRANSMITTED AN ELECTRICAL CURRENT THROUGH THE EARTH FOR ONE MILE SO AS TO PRODUCE SIGNALS IN A TELEPHONE
6077-56146-0011 PROFESSOR DOLBEAR USED FOR A SHORT DISTANCE FIFTY FEET SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME ARRANGEMENT AS MARCONI NOW USES EXCEPT THAT THE FORMER USED A TELEPHONE AS A RECEIVER HE USED AN INDUCTION COIL
6077-56146-0012 HAVING ONE END OF THE SECONDARY WIRE CONNECTED WITH THE EARTH WHILE THE OTHER WAS ATTACHED TO A WIRE RUNNING UP INTO THE AIR AT THE RECEIVING END A WIRE STARTING FROM THE EARTH EXTENDED INTO THE AIR PASSING THROUGH A TELEPHONE WHICH ACTED AS A RECEIVER
6077-56146-0013 IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX HE USED A KITE TO ELEVATE THE WIRE THROUGH WHICH ELECTRICAL DISCHARGES OF HIGH VOLTAGE WERE MADE INTO THE AIR TO PRODUCE ETHER WAVES THE RECEIVER BEING TWO THOUSAND FEET AWAY
6077-56146-0014 DOLBEAR'S EXPERIMENTS WERE PUBLIC FOURTEEN YEARS AGO BUT AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO INTEREST IN SUCH MATTERS SO THAT HIS WORK RECEIVED LITTLE OR NO ATTENTION IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN DOCTOR HERTZ OF GERMANY
6077-56146-0015 MADE SOME EXPERIMENTS IN PRODUCING AND DETECTING ETHER WAVES AND HE DID A GREAT DEAL TO AWAKEN AN INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT SO THAT OTHERS BEGAN INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAVE LED TO ITS PRESENT USE AS A MEANS OF TELEGRAPHING
6077-56146-0016 TO A DISTANCE OF MANY MILES IN EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE PROFESSOR BRANLY OF PARIS INVENTED THE COHERER IN EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR IT WAS IMPROVED BY LODGE
6077-56146-0017 AND BY HIM USED AS A DETECTOR OF ETHER WAVES IN EIGHTEEN NINETY SIX
6077-56146-0018 MARCONI AN ITALIAN SUBSTITUTED THE COHERER OF BRANLY FOR THE TELEPHONE OF DOLBEAR THIS COHERER IS CONSTRUCTED AND OPERATED AS FOLLOWS IT CONSISTS OF A GLASS TUBE
6077-56146-0019 OF COMPARATIVELY SMALL DIAMETER LOOSELY FILLED WITH METAL FILINGS OF A CERTAIN GRADE THIS BODY OF METAL DUST IS MADE A PART OF A LOCAL BATTERY CIRCUIT IN WHICH IS PLACED AN ORDINARY ELECTRIC BELL OR TELEGRAPHIC SOUNDER
6077-56146-0020 THE RESISTANCE OF THIS BODY OF FILINGS IS SO GREAT THAT CURRENT ENOUGH WILL NOT PASS THROUGH IT TO RING THE BELL OR ACTUATE THE SOUNDER UNTIL AN ETHER WAVE STRIKES IT AND THE WIRE ATTACHED TO IT
6077-56146-0021 THE FILINGS MUST BE MADE TO DE COHERE AND TO ACCOMPLISH THIS A LITTLE TAPPER THAT WORKS AUTOMATICALLY BETWEEN THE SIGNALS STRIKES THE GLASS TUBE WITH A SUCCESSION OF LIGHT BLOWS BRIEFLY STATED
6077-56146-0022 WHILE THE OTHER EXTENDS INTO THE AIR A GREATER OR LESS DISTANCE ACCORDING TO THE DISTANCE IT IS DESIRED TO SEND SIGNALS THE GREATER THE DISTANCE THE HIGHER THE WIRE SHOULD EXTEND INTO THE AIR AT THE RECEIVING END
6077-56146-0023 A WIRE OF CORRESPONDING HEIGHT IS ERECTED ALSO CONNECTED WITH THE EARTH IN THIS WIRE AS A PART OF ITS CIRCUIT IS PLACED THE COHERER IN A LOCAL CIRCUIT THAT IS CONNECTED TO THE UPRIGHT WIRE IN PARALLEL WITH THE COHERER
6077-56146-0024 IS PLACED A BATTERY A SOUNDER OR A BELL THAT IS RUNG WHEN THE FILINGS COHERE WHEN AN ETHER WAVE IS SET UP BY A DISCHARGE OF ELECTRICITY INTO THE AIR IT STRIKES THE PERPENDICULAR WIRE OF THE RECEIVER
6077-56146-0025 AND THAT PORTION OF THE WAVE THAT STRIKES IS CONVERTED INTO ELECTRICITY WHICH IS CALLED AN INDUCED CURRENT IT IS THIS CURRENT AS IT DISCHARGES THROUGH THE COHERER TO THE EARTH THAT CAUSES THE FILINGS TO UNITE
6077-56146-0026 WHILE MARCONI HAS DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER MAN TO IMPROVE AND POPULARIZE WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY HISTORY SHOWS THAT HE INVENTED NONE OF THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS SO FAR AS THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN MADE PUBLIC
6077-56146-0027 WHAT HE SEEMS TO HAVE REALLY DONE WAS TO SUBSTITUTE THE COHERER OF BRANLY AND LODGE WITH ITS ADJUNCTS FOR THE TELEPHONE OF DOLBEAR THERE IS NO DOUBT BUT THAT MARCONI HAS DONE MUCH TO IMPROVE
6077-56146-0028 AND ENLARGE THE CAPACITY OF THE APPARATUS AND TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE WORLD SOME OF ITS POSSIBILITIES HE HAS BEEN AN INDEFATIGABLE WORKER AND DESERVES GREAT CREDIT BUT WITHOUT THE WORK OF THOSE WHO PRECEDED HIM HE COULD NOT HAVE SUCCEEDED
6077-56146-0029 THE HONORS SHOULD BE DIVIDED THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN USED AT VARIOUS TIMES FOR REPORTING YACHT RACES AND BETWEEN SHIPS IT IS SAID ALSO TO HAVE BEEN USED TO SOME EXTENT IN THE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR
6077-56146-0030 THERE IS MUCH TO BE DONE YET HOWEVER BEFORE IT CAN BE MADE ENTIRELY RELIABLE FOR DEFENSIVE WORK IN TIME OF WAR AS IT IS NOW ALL AN ENEMY WOULD HAVE TO DO TO DESTROY ITS USEFULNESS
6077-56146-0031 TO WORK AUTOMATICALLY ANYWHERE WITHIN THE SPHERE OF INFLUENCE OF THE SYSTEM TO SPEAK DIPLOMATICALLY WHEN IT WOULD RENDER UNINTELLIGIBLE ANY MESSAGE THAT SHOULD BE SENT TO MAKE THE SYSTEM OF THE GREATEST VALUE
6077-56146-0032 SOME SORT OF SELECTIVE RECEIVER MUST BE INVENTED THAT WILL SELECT SIGNALS SENT FROM A TRANSMITTER THAT IS DESIGNED TO WORK WITH IT THERE IS NO DOUBT BUT THAT
6077-56146-0033 BUT IN THIS CASE IT IS NOT THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF INDUCTION BUT CONDUCTION IT HAS BEEN EXPLAINED IN FORMER CHAPTERS THAT EARTH CURRENTS ARE CONSTANTLY FLOWING FROM ONE POINT TO ANOTHER
6077-56146-0034 SOMETIMES THESE INEQUALITIES OF POTENTIAL ARE CAUSED BY HEAT AND SOMETIMES BY ELECTRICITY AS IN THE CASE OF A THUNDER STORM IF A CLOUD IS HEAVILY CHARGED WITH POSITIVE ELECTRICITY SAY THE EARTH UNDERNEATH
6077-56146-0035 WILL HAVE AN EQUAL CHARGE OF NEGATIVE ELECTRICITY LET US ILLUSTRATE IT BY THE TIDES AS THE MOON PASSES OVER THE OCEAN IT ATTRACTS THE WATER TOWARD IT AND TENDS TO PILE UP AS IT WERE AT THE NEAREST POINT BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE MOON
6077-56146-0036 SUPPOSE THAT WHILE THE WATER IS THUS PILED UP AT A POINT UNDER THE MOON WE COULD SUDDENLY SUSPEND THE ATTRACTION BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE MOON THE WATER WOULD BEGIN IMMEDIATELY TO FLOW OFF BY THE FORCE OF GRAVITATION
6077-56146-0037 UNTIL IT HAD FOUND A COMMON LEVEL SUPPOSE IN THE PLACE OF THE MOON WE HAVE A CLOUD CONTAINING A STATIC CHARGE OF POSITIVE ELECTRICITY IT ATTRACTS A NEGATIVE CHARGE TO A POINT ON THE EARTH NEAREST THE CLOUD IF NOW
6077-56146-0038 A DISCHARGE TAKES PLACE BETWEEN THE EARTH AND CLOUD THE POTENTIAL BETWEEN THE TWO WILL SUDDENLY BECOME EQUALIZED AND THE STATIC CHARGE THAT WAS ACCUMULATED IN THE EARTH IS RELEASED AND IT DISSIPATES IN EVERY DIRECTION SEEKING AN EQUILIBRIUM
6077-56146-0039 FOLLOWING THE ANALOGY OF THE WATER THE DIFFERENCE BEING THAT IN ONE CASE THE MOVEMENT IS VERY SLOW WHILE IN THE OTHER IT IS AS QUICK AS LIGHTNING ABOUT EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO I HAD A SHORT TELEPHONE LINE BETWEEN MY HOUSE
6077-56146-0040 AND THAT OF ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS THIS LINE WAS EQUIPPED WITH WHAT WAS KNOWN IN THOSE DAYS AS MAGNETO TRANSMITTERS SUCH AS WE HAVE DESCRIBED IN A PREVIOUS CHAPTER ON THE SUBJECT OF TELEPHONY WHEN A LINE IS EQUIPPED IN THIS WAY NO BATTERIES ARE NEEDED
6077-56146-0041 AS THE VOICE GENERATES THE CURRENT ON THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE OFTEN ON SUMMER EVENINGS WHEN THE SKY APPEARS TO BE CLOUDLESS WE CAN SEE FAINT FLASHES OF LIGHTNING ON THE HORIZON AN APPEARANCE WHICH IS COMMONLY CALLED
6077-56146-0042 HEAT LIGHTNING AS A MATTER OF FACT I DO NOT SUPPOSE THERE IS ANY SUCH THING AS HEAT LIGHTNING BUT WHAT WE SEE IS THE EFFECT OF VERY DISTANT STORM CLOUDS OFTEN AT SUCH TIMES I HAVE HELD THE TELEPHONE RECEIVER TO MY EAR
6077-56146-0043 AND COULD HEAR SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH EACH FLASH A SLIGHT SOUND IN THE TELEPHONE THIS EFFECT COULD BE PRODUCED IN THE EARTH BY A SIMPLE DISCHARGE BETWEEN TWO OR MORE CLOUDS WHICH WOULD DISTRIBUTE THE ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE OVER A GREATER AREA
6077-56146-0044 BUT THAT BOTH OF THESE EFFECTS ETHER WAVES AND CONDUCTION THROUGH EARTH MAY BE FELT WHEN A DISCHARGE TAKES PLACE BETWEEN A CLOUD AND THE EARTH IF WE COULD BY OPERATING AN ORDINARY TELEGRAPHIC KEY
6077-56146-0045 COULD TRANSMIT THE MORSE CODE THROUGH THE EARTH TO THE MAN WHO WAS LISTENING AT THE TELEPHONE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MIGHT BE LISTENING AT TELEPHONES IN EVERY DIRECTION FROM THE TRANSMITTING STATION AND THEY WOULD ALL GET THE SAME MESSAGE
6077-56146-0046 AND NO PART OF THE LINE BETWEEN THE TWO STATIONS WAS ABOVE GROUND MANY AND MANY TIMES DURING THE PREVALENCE OF A THUNDER STORM HAVE THE TELEPHONE BELLS BEEN MADE TO RING AT BOTH ENDS OF THE LINE
6077-56146-0047 AND IN SOME CASES THE DISCHARGE WAS SEVERAL MILES AWAY THE WIRES COULD NOT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED SO POWERFULLY IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN THROUGH THE EARTH IT WILL BE SEEN BY THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS
6077-56146-0048 THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO TRANSMIT MESSAGES THROUGH THE EARTH FOR LONG DISTANCES BUT THE DIFFICULTY IN THE WAY OF ITS BECOMING A GENERAL SYSTEM IS TWOFOLD FIRST WE CANNOT ALWAYS HAVE A THUNDER CLOUD AT HAND FROM WHICH TO TRANSMIT OUR SIGNALS
