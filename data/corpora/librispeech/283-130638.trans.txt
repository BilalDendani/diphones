283-130638-0000 AND GOT OUR CLOTHES WASHED WE HAD TRIED WASHING THEM OURSELVES IN THE RIVER UNDER GEORGE'S SUPERINTENDENCE AND IT HAD BEEN A FAILURE INDEED IT HAD BEEN MORE THAN A FAILURE
283-130638-0001 BECAUSE WE WERE WORSE OFF AFTER WE HAD WASHED OUR CLOTHES THAN WE WERE BEFORE BEFORE WE HAD WASHED THEM THEY HAD BEEN VERY VERY DIRTY IT IS TRUE BUT THEY WERE JUST WEARABLE AFTER WE HAD WASHED THEM WELL
283-130638-0002 THE RIVER BETWEEN READING AND HENLEY WAS MUCH CLEANER AFTER WE HAD WASHED OUR CLOTHES IN IT THAN IT WAS BEFORE ALL THE DIRT CONTAINED IN THE RIVER BETWEEN READING AND HENLEY WE COLLECTED DURING THAT WASH AND WORKED IT INTO OUR CLOTHES
283-130638-0003 THE WASHERWOMAN AT STREATLEY SAID SHE FELT SHE OWED IT TO HERSELF TO CHARGE US JUST THREE TIMES THE USUAL PRICES FOR THAT WASH SHE SAID IT HAD NOT BEEN LIKE WASHING IT HAD BEEN MORE IN THE NATURE OF EXCAVATING
283-130638-0004 WE PAID THE BILL WITHOUT A MURMUR THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF STREATLEY AND GORING IS A GREAT FISHING CENTRE THERE IS SOME EXCELLENT FISHING TO BE HAD HERE
283-130638-0005 THE RIVER ABOUNDS IN PIKE ROACH DACE GUDGEON AND EELS JUST HERE AND YOU CAN SIT AND FISH FOR THEM ALL DAY SOME PEOPLE DO THEY NEVER CATCH THEM
283-130638-0006 I NEVER KNEW ANYBODY CATCH ANYTHING UP THE THAMES EXCEPT MINNOWS AND DEAD CATS BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO OF COURSE WITH FISHING THE LOCAL FISHERMAN'S GUIDE DOESN'T SAY A WORD ABOUT CATCHING ANYTHING ALL IT SAYS IS THE PLACE IS
283-130638-0007 A GOOD STATION FOR FISHING AND FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN OF THE DISTRICT I AM QUITE PREPARED TO BEAR OUT THIS STATEMENT THERE IS NO SPOT IN THE WORLD WHERE YOU CAN GET MORE FISHING
283-130638-0008 SOME FISHERMEN COME HERE AND FISH FOR A DAY AND OTHERS STOP AND FISH FOR A MONTH
283-130638-0009 IT WILL BE ALL THE SAME THE ANGLER'S GUIDE TO THE THAMES SAYS THAT JACK AND PERCH ARE ALSO TO BE HAD ABOUT HERE BUT THERE THE ANGLER'S GUIDE IS WRONG
283-130638-0010 JACK AND PERCH MAY BE ABOUT THERE INDEED I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THEY ARE YOU CAN SEE THEM THERE IN SHOALS WHEN YOU ARE OUT FOR A WALK ALONG THE BANKS
283-130638-0011 THEY COME AND STAND HALF OUT OF THE WATER WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN FOR BISCUITS AND IF YOU GO FOR A BATHE THEY CROWD ROUND AND GET IN YOUR WAY AND IRRITATE YOU BUT THEY ARE NOT TO BE HAD BY A BIT OF WORM ON THE END OF A HOOK NOR ANYTHING LIKE IT
283-130638-0012 NOT THEY I AM NOT A GOOD FISHERMAN MYSELF I DEVOTED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION TO THE SUBJECT AT ONE TIME AND WAS GETTING ON AS I THOUGHT FAIRLY WELL BUT THE OLD HANDS TOLD ME THAT I SHOULD NEVER BE ANY REAL GOOD AT IT
283-130638-0013 AND ADVISED ME TO GIVE IT UP THEY SAID THAT I WAS AN EXTREMELY NEAT THROWER AND THAT I SEEMED TO HAVE PLENTY OF GUMPTION FOR THE THING AND QUITE ENOUGH CONSTITUTIONAL LAZINESS BUT THEY WERE SURE I SHOULD NEVER MAKE ANYTHING OF A FISHERMAN
283-130638-0014 I HAD NOT GOT SUFFICIENT IMAGINATION THEY SAID THAT AS A POET OR A SHILLING SHOCKER OR A REPORTER OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND I MIGHT BE SATISFACTORY BUT THAT TO GAIN ANY POSITION AS A THAMES ANGLER
283-130638-0015 WOULD REQUIRE MORE PLAY OF FANCY MORE POWER OF INVENTION THAN I APPEARED TO POSSESS SOME PEOPLE ARE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT ALL THAT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE A GOOD FISHERMAN IS THE ABILITY TO TELL LIES EASILY AND WITHOUT BLUSHING
283-130638-0016 BUT THIS IS A MISTAKE MERE BALD FABRICATION IS USELESS THE VERIEST TYRO CAN MANAGE THAT IT IS IN THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL DETAIL THE EMBELLISHING TOUCHES OF PROBABILITY
283-130638-0017 THE GENERAL AIR OF SCRUPULOUS ALMOST OF PEDANTIC VERACITY THAT THE EXPERIENCED ANGLER IS SEEN ANYBODY CAN COME IN AND SAY OH I CAUGHT FIFTEEN DOZEN PERCH YESTERDAY EVENING OR
283-130638-0018 LAST MONDAY I LANDED A GUDGEON WEIGHING EIGHTEEN POUNDS AND MEASURING THREE FEET FROM THE TIP TO THE TAIL THERE IS NO ART NO SKILL REQUIRED FOR THAT SORT OF THING IT SHOWS PLUCK BUT THAT IS ALL
283-130638-0019 NO YOUR ACCOMPLISHED ANGLER WOULD SCORN TO TELL A LIE THAT WAY HIS METHOD IS A STUDY IN ITSELF HE COMES IN QUIETLY WITH HIS HAT ON APPROPRIATES THE MOST COMFORTABLE CHAIR
283-130638-0020 LIGHTS HIS PIPE AND COMMENCES TO PUFF IN SILENCE HE LETS THE YOUNGSTERS BRAG AWAY FOR A WHILE AND THEN DURING A MOMENTARY LULL HE REMOVES THE PIPE FROM HIS MOUTH AND REMARKS AS HE KNOCKS THE ASHES OUT AGAINST THE BARS
283-130638-0021 WELL I HAD A HAUL ON TUESDAY EVENING THAT IT'S NOT MUCH GOOD MY TELLING ANYBODY ABOUT OH WHY'S THAT THEY ASK BECAUSE I DON'T EXPECT ANYBODY WOULD BELIEVE ME IF I DID REPLIES THE OLD FELLOW CALMLY
283-130638-0022 AND WITHOUT EVEN A TINGE OF BITTERNESS IN HIS TONE AS HE REFILLS HIS PIPE AND REQUESTS THE LANDLORD TO BRING HIM THREE OF SCOTCH COLD THERE IS A PAUSE AFTER THIS
283-130638-0023 SO HE HAS TO GO ON BY HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY ENCOURAGEMENT NO HE CONTINUES THOUGHTFULLY I SHOULDN'T BELIEVE IT MYSELF IF ANYBODY TOLD IT TO ME BUT IT'S A FACT FOR ALL THAT I HAD BEEN SITTING THERE ALL THE AFTERNOON AND HAD CAUGHT LITERALLY NOTHING
283-130638-0024 AND I WAS JUST ABOUT GIVING IT UP AS A BAD JOB WHEN I SUDDENLY FELT A RATHER SMART PULL AT THE LINE I THOUGHT IT WAS ANOTHER LITTLE ONE AND I WENT TO JERK IT UP
283-130638-0025 IT TOOK ME HALF AN HOUR HALF AN HOUR SIR TO LAND THAT FISH AND EVERY MOMENT I THOUGHT THE LINE WAS GOING TO SNAP I REACHED HIM AT LAST
283-130638-0026 A STURGEON A FORTY POUND STURGEON TAKEN ON A LINE SIR YES YOU MAY WELL LOOK SURPRISED I'LL HAVE ANOTHER THREE OF SCOTCH LANDLORD PLEASE AND THEN HE GOES ON TO TELL OF THE ASTONISHMENT OF EVERYBODY WHO SAW IT
283-130638-0027 AND WHAT HIS WIFE SAID WHEN HE GOT HOME AND OF WHAT JOE BUGGLES THOUGHT ABOUT IT I ASKED THE LANDLORD OF AN INN UP THE RIVER ONCE IF IT DID NOT INJURE HIM SOMETIMES LISTENING TO THE TALES THAT THE FISHERMEN ABOUT THERE TOLD HIM AND HE SAID
283-130638-0028 OH NO NOT NOW SIR IT DID USED TO KNOCK ME OVER A BIT AT FIRST BUT LOR LOVE YOU ME AND THE MISSUS WE LISTENS TO EM ALL DAY NOW IT'S WHAT YOU'RE USED TO YOU KNOW IT'S WHAT YOU'RE USED TO
283-130638-0029 I KNEW A YOUNG MAN ONCE HE WAS A MOST CONSCIENTIOUS FELLOW AND WHEN HE TOOK TO FLY FISHING HE DETERMINED NEVER TO EXAGGERATE HIS HAULS BY MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE PER CENT WHEN I HAVE CAUGHT FORTY FISH SAID HE
283-130638-0030 THEN I WILL TELL PEOPLE THAT I HAVE CAUGHT FIFTY AND SO ON BUT I WILL NOT LIE ANY MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE IT IS SINFUL TO LIE BUT THE TWENTY FIVE PER CENT PLAN DID NOT WORK WELL AT ALL HE NEVER WAS ABLE TO USE IT
283-130638-0031 THE GREATEST NUMBER OF FISH HE EVER CAUGHT IN ONE DAY WAS THREE AND YOU CAN'T ADD TWENTY FIVE PER CENT TO THREE AT LEAST NOT IN FISH SO HE INCREASED HIS PERCENTAGE TO THIRTY THREE AND A THIRD
283-130638-0032 BUT THAT AGAIN WAS AWKWARD WHEN HE HAD ONLY CAUGHT ONE OR TWO SO TO SIMPLIFY MATTERS HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO JUST DOUBLE THE QUANTITY
283-130638-0033 AND THEN HE GREW DISSATISFIED WITH IT NOBODY BELIEVED HIM WHEN HE TOLD THEM THAT HE ONLY DOUBLED AND HE THEREFORE GAINED NO CREDIT THAT WAY WHATEVER WHILE HIS MODERATION PUT HIM AT A DISADVANTAGE AMONG THE OTHER ANGLERS
283-130638-0034 WHEN HE HAD REALLY CAUGHT THREE SMALL FISH AND SAID HE HAD CAUGHT SIX IT USED TO MAKE HIM QUITE JEALOUS TO HEAR A MAN WHOM HE KNEW FOR A FACT HAD ONLY CAUGHT ONE GOING ABOUT TELLING PEOPLE HE HAD LANDED TWO DOZEN
283-130638-0035 SO EVENTUALLY HE MADE ONE FINAL ARRANGEMENT WITH HIMSELF WHICH HE HAS RELIGIOUSLY HELD TO EVER SINCE AND THAT WAS TO COUNT EACH FISH THAT HE CAUGHT AS TEN AND TO ASSUME TEN TO BEGIN WITH FOR EXAMPLE
283-130638-0036 IF HE DID NOT CATCH ANY FISH AT ALL THEN HE SAID HE HAD CAUGHT TEN FISH YOU COULD NEVER CATCH LESS THAN TEN FISH BY HIS SYSTEM THAT WAS THE FOUNDATION OF IT
283-130638-0037 THEN IF BY ANY CHANCE HE REALLY DID CATCH ONE FISH HE CALLED IT TWENTY WHILE TWO FISH WOULD COUNT THIRTY THREE FORTY AND SO ON IT IS A SIMPLE AND EASILY WORKED PLAN
283-130638-0038 AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME TALK LATELY OF ITS BEING MADE USE OF BY THE ANGLING FRATERNITY IN GENERAL INDEED THE COMMITTEE OF THE THAMES ANGLER'S ASSOCIATION DID RECOMMEND ITS ADOPTION ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO BUT SOME OF THE OLDER MEMBERS OPPOSED IT
283-130638-0039 THEY SAID THEY WOULD CONSIDER THE IDEA IF THE NUMBER WERE DOUBLED AND EACH FISH COUNTED AS TWENTY IF EVER YOU HAVE AN EVENING TO SPARE UP THE RIVER I SHOULD ADVISE YOU TO DROP INTO ONE OF THE LITTLE VILLAGE INNS AND TAKE A SEAT IN THE TAP ROOM
283-130638-0040 YOU WILL BE NEARLY SURE TO MEET ONE OR TWO OLD ROD MEN SIPPING THEIR TODDY THERE AND THEY WILL TELL YOU ENOUGH FISHY STORIES IN HALF AN HOUR TO GIVE YOU INDIGESTION FOR A MONTH GEORGE AND I I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HARRIS
283-130638-0041 HE HAD GONE OUT AND HAD A SHAVE EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON AND HAD THEN COME BACK AND SPENT FULL FORTY MINUTES IN PIPECLAYING HIS SHOES WE HAD NOT SEEN HIM SINCE
283-130638-0042 AND COMING HOME WE CALLED IN AT A LITTLE RIVER SIDE INN FOR A REST AND OTHER THINGS WE WENT INTO THE PARLOUR AND SAT DOWN THERE WAS AN OLD FELLOW THERE SMOKING A LONG CLAY PIPE AND WE NATURALLY BEGAN CHATTING
283-130638-0043 HE TOLD US THAT IT HAD BEEN A FINE DAY TO DAY AND WE TOLD HIM THAT IT HAD BEEN A FINE DAY YESTERDAY
283-130638-0044 AND GEORGE SAID THE CROPS SEEMED TO BE COMING UP NICELY AFTER THAT IT CAME OUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER THAT WE WERE STRANGERS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
283-130638-0045 DURING WHICH OUR EYES WANDERED ROUND THE ROOM THEY FINALLY RESTED UPON A DUSTY OLD GLASS CASE FIXED VERY HIGH UP ABOVE THE CHIMNEY PIECE AND CONTAINING A TROUT IT RATHER FASCINATED ME THAT TROUT IT WAS SUCH A MONSTROUS FISH
283-130638-0046 IN FACT AT FIRST GLANCE I THOUGHT IT WAS A COD AH SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN FOLLOWING THE DIRECTION OF MY GAZE FINE FELLOW THAT AIN'T HE QUITE UNCOMMON I MURMURED
283-130638-0047 AND GEORGE ASKED THE OLD MAN HOW MUCH HE THOUGHT IT WEIGHED EIGHTEEN POUNDS SIX OUNCES SAID OUR FRIEND RISING AND TAKING DOWN HIS COAT YES HE CONTINUED IT WUR SIXTEEN YEAR AGO COME THE THIRD O NEXT MONTH THAT I LANDED HIM
283-130638-0048 I CAUGHT HIM JUST BELOW THE BRIDGE WITH A MINNOW THEY TOLD ME HE WUR IN THE RIVER AND I SAID I'D HAVE HIM AND SO I DID YOU DON'T SEE MANY FISH THAT SIZE ABOUT HERE NOW I'M THINKING GOOD NIGHT GENTLEMEN GOOD NIGHT
283-130638-0049 AND OUT HE WENT AND LEFT US ALONE WE COULD NOT TAKE OUR EYES OFF THE FISH AFTER THAT IT REALLY WAS A REMARKABLY FINE FISH WE WERE STILL LOOKING AT IT WHEN THE LOCAL CARRIER WHO HAD JUST STOPPED AT THE INN
283-130638-0050 CAME TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM WITH A POT OF BEER IN HIS HAND AND HE ALSO LOOKED AT THE FISH GOOD SIZED TROUT THAT SAID GEORGE TURNING ROUND TO HIM AH YOU MAY WELL SAY THAT SIR REPLIED THE MAN
283-130638-0051 NO WE TOLD HIM WE WERE STRANGERS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AH SAID THE CARRIER THEN OF COURSE HOW SHOULD YOU IT WAS NEARLY FIVE YEARS AGO THAT I CAUGHT THAT TROUT OH WAS IT YOU WHO CAUGHT IT THEN SAID I
283-130638-0052 YES SIR REPLIED THE GENIAL OLD FELLOW I CAUGHT HIM JUST BELOW THE LOCK LEASTWAYS WHAT WAS THE LOCK THEN ONE FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND THE REMARKABLE THING ABOUT IT IS THAT I CAUGHT HIM WITH A FLY
283-130638-0053 I'D GONE OUT PIKE FISHING BLESS YOU NEVER THINKING OF A TROUT AND WHEN I SAW THAT WHOPPER ON THE END OF MY LINE BLEST IF IT DIDN'T QUITE TAKE ME ABACK WELL YOU SEE HE WEIGHED TWENTY SIX POUND GOOD NIGHT GENTLEMEN GOOD NIGHT
283-130638-0054 FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS A THIRD MAN CAME IN AND DESCRIBED HOW HE HAD CAUGHT IT EARLY ONE MORNING WITH BLEAK AND THEN HE LEFT AND A STOLID SOLEMN LOOKING MIDDLE AGED INDIVIDUAL CAME IN
283-130638-0055 AND SAT DOWN OVER BY THE WINDOW NONE OF US SPOKE FOR A WHILE BUT AT LENGTH GEORGE TURNED TO THE NEW COMER AND SAID I BEG YOUR PARDON I HOPE YOU WILL FORGIVE THE LIBERTY THAT WE PERFECT STRANGERS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ARE TAKING
283-130638-0056 BUT MY FRIEND HERE AND MYSELF WOULD BE SO MUCH OBLIGED IF YOU WOULD TELL US HOW YOU CAUGHT THAT TROUT UP THERE WHY WHO TOLD YOU I CAUGHT THAT TROUT WAS THE SURPRISED QUERY
283-130638-0057 WE SAID THAT NOBODY HAD TOLD US SO BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER WE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT IT WAS HE WHO HAD DONE IT WELL IT'S A MOST REMARKABLE THING MOST REMARKABLE
283-130638-0058 BECAUSE AS A MATTER OF FACT YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT I DID CATCH IT BUT FANCY YOUR GUESSING IT LIKE THAT DEAR ME IT'S REALLY A MOST REMARKABLE THING AND THEN HE WENT ON AND TOLD US HOW IT HAD TAKEN HIM HALF AN HOUR TO LAND IT
283-130638-0059 AND HOW IT HAD BROKEN HIS ROD HE SAID HE HAD WEIGHED IT CAREFULLY WHEN HE REACHED HOME AND IT HAD TURNED THE SCALE AT THIRTY FOUR POUNDS HE WENT IN HIS TURN AND WHEN HE WAS GONE THE LANDLORD CAME IN TO US
283-130638-0060 WE TOLD HIM THE VARIOUS HISTORIES WE HAD HEARD ABOUT HIS TROUT AND HE WAS IMMENSELY AMUSED AND WE ALL LAUGHED VERY HEARTILY
283-130638-0061 FANCY JIM BATES AND JOE MUGGLES AND MISTER JONES AND OLD BILLY MAUNDERS ALL TELLING YOU THAT THEY HAD CAUGHT IT HA HA HA WELL THAT IS GOOD SAID THE HONEST OLD FELLOW LAUGHING HEARTILY
283-130638-0062 YES THEY ARE THE SORT TO GIVE IT ME TO PUT UP IN MY PARLOUR IF THEY HAD CAUGHT IT THEY ARE HA HA HA AND THEN HE TOLD US THE REAL HISTORY OF THE FISH IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD CAUGHT IT HIMSELF YEARS AGO WHEN HE WAS QUITE A LAD
283-130638-0063 NOT BY ANY ART OR SKILL BUT BY THAT UNACCOUNTABLE LUCK THAT APPEARS TO ALWAYS WAIT UPON A BOY WHEN HE PLAYS THE WAG FROM SCHOOL AND GOES OUT FISHING ON A SUNNY AFTERNOON WITH A BIT OF STRING TIED ON TO THE END OF A TREE
283-130638-0064 HE SAID THAT BRINGING HOME THAT TROUT HAD SAVED HIM FROM A WHACKING AND THAT EVEN HIS SCHOOL MASTER HAD SAID IT WAS WORTH THE RULE OF THREE AND PRACTICE PUT TOGETHER HE WAS CALLED OUT OF THE ROOM AT THIS POINT
283-130638-0065 IT REALLY WAS A MOST ASTONISHING TROUT THE MORE WE LOOKED AT IT THE MORE WE MARVELLED AT IT IT EXCITED GEORGE SO MUCH THAT HE CLIMBED UP ON THE BACK OF A CHAIR TO GET A BETTER VIEW OF IT AND THEN THE CHAIR SLIPPED
283-130638-0066 AND GEORGE CLUTCHED WILDLY AT THE TROUT CASE TO SAVE HIMSELF
283-130638-0067 YOU HAVEN'T INJURED THE FISH HAVE YOU I CRIED IN ALARM RUSHING UP I HOPE NOT SAID GEORGE RISING CAUTIOUSLY AND LOOKING ABOUT BUT HE HAD
283-130638-0068 THAT TROUT LAY SHATTERED INTO A THOUSAND FRAGMENTS I SAY A THOUSAND BUT THEY MAY HAVE ONLY BEEN NINE HUNDRED I DID NOT COUNT THEM
283-130638-0069 WE THOUGHT IT STRANGE AND UNACCOUNTABLE THAT A STUFFED TROUT SHOULD BREAK UP INTO LITTLE PIECES LIKE THAT AND SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STRANGE AND UNACCOUNTABLE IF IT HAD BEEN A STUFFED TROUT BUT IT WAS NOT
