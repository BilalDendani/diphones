6308-68358-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN A WORLD FAMOUS CITY JERUSALEM THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD IS LARGELY THE STORY OF THE RISE AND FALL OF GREAT CITIES
6308-68358-0001 IN THESE GREAT CENTERS ONE CAN FEEL THE HEART THROB OF CIVILIZATION SOME OF THE GREAT CITIES OF TODAY ARE FAMOUS FOR THEIR SIZE SUCH AS NEW YORK AND LONDON SOME FOR THEIR BEAUTY
6308-68358-0002 LIKE PARIS AND RIO JANEIRO SOME FOR THEIR CULTURE AND LEARNING AS BOSTON AND OXFORD SOME FOR THEIR MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIAL SUPREMACY AS DETROIT AND LIVERPOOL
6308-68358-0003 BUT THERE IS ONE CITY ON THE GLOBE NOT NEARLY AS LARGE AS DES MOINES NOT AT ALL BEAUTIFUL ITS PEOPLE NEITHER CULTURED NOR LEARNED HAS NO FACTORIES AND ONE NARROW GAUGE RAILWAY
6308-68358-0004 TAKES CARE OF MOST OF ITS COMMERCE AND YET IT IS BY FAR THE MOST FAMOUS CITY OF ALL TIME IT IS THE CITY OF JERUSALEM
6308-68358-0005 THE SITE OF THE CITY WAS ONCE OWNED BY A FARMER WHOSE NAME WAS OMAN HE HAD A THRESHING FLOOR ON THE TOP OF MOUNT MORIAH THE CITY AS IT IS TODAY IS ON TOP OF TWO MOUNTAINS
6308-68358-0006 BUT THE VALLEY BETWEEN HAS BEEN FILLED UP SO THAT IT IS ALMOST LIKE ONE CONTINUOUS MOUNTAIN TOP HIGHER MOUNTAINS ARE PRACTICALLY ON EVERY SIDE SO THAT THE MOMENT ONE SEES THE CITY
6308-68358-0007 HE THINKS OF THE SCRIPTURE AS THE MOUNTAINS ARE ROUND ABOUT JERUSALEM SO IS THE LORD ROUND ABOUT HIS PEOPLE TO GET AN IDEA OF THE CITY AS IT WAS WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT
6308-68358-0008 YOU MUST IMAGINE A CITY OF ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WITHOUT STREET CARS ELECTRIC LIGHTS TELEPHONES WATERWORKS SEWER SYSTEM OR ANY MODERN IMPROVEMENTS WHATEVER
6308-68358-0009 HOWEVER GENERAL ALLENBY'S ENTRANCE INTO THE CITY IN DECEMBER NINETEEN SEVENTEEN WAS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA IN THREE MONTHS THE ENGLISH DID MORE FOR THE CITY THAN THE TURK DID IN A THOUSAND YEARS
6308-68358-0010 THERE IS AN OLD ARAB LEGEND WHICH SAYS NOT UNTIL THE RIVER NILE FLOWS INTO PALESTINE WILL THE TURK BE DRIVEN FROM PALESTINE
6308-68358-0011 OF COURSE THIS WAS THEIR WAY OF SAYING THAT SUCH A THING WOULD NEVER COME TO PASS FOR THE TURK ACTUALLY BELIEVED THAT HE HAD SUCH A HOLD ON THAT COUNTRY THAT THERE WAS NO POWER ON EARTH THAT COULD MAKE HIM GIVE IT UP
6308-68358-0012 BUT WHEN THE ENGLISH STARTED FROM EGYPT THEY NOT ONLY BUILT A RAILROAD AS THEY WENT TOWARD JERUSALEM BUT NOT FAR FROM THE NILE THEY PREPARED A GREAT FILTERING PROCESS TO CLEANSE THE WATER
6308-68358-0013 AND THEN LAID A TWELVE INCH PIPE AND BROUGHT THE PURE WATER ALONG WITH THEM FOR BOTH MAN AND BEAST WHEREVER THEY STOPPED FOR A LENGTH OF TIME IN THE DESERT THE GLOWING SANDS BECAME POOLS
6308-68358-0014 AS THE PROPHET HAD FORECASTED AND THE DESERT BEGAN TO BLOSSOM AS THE ROSE SIXTY FIVE DAYS AFTER GENERAL ALLENBY ENTERED THE JAFFA GATE INTO THE CITY OF JERUSALEM THE WATER PIPE OR SYSTEM
6308-68358-0015 WAS BROUGHT INTO THE CITY AND THE CANADIAN ENGINEER HAD MADE THE ARAB LEGEND A REALITY BRINGING THE SWEET WATERS OF THE NILE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES AWAY INTO THE CITY OF THE GREAT KING
6308-68358-0016 JERUSALEM IS TO THIS DAY A WALLED CITY THE WALLS AVERAGE SOME THIRTY FEET HIGH AND ARE ABOUT FIFTEEN FEET THICK AT THE TOP
6308-68358-0017 IT IS A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO AND ONE HALF MILES AROUND THE CITY WALL BUT THE CITY ITSELF HAS OUTGROWN THESE LIMITATIONS QUITE A PORTION OF IT BEING ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE WALL
6308-68358-0018 THE HOTEL AT WHICH THE WRITER STOPPED WHILE VISITING THE CITY SOME YEARS AGO WAS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE WALL AS ARE MANY OF THE BEST BUILDINGS THE STREETS ARE NARROW THE HOUSES HAVE FLAT TOPS
6308-68358-0019 AND MANY OF THEM ARE BUT ONE OR TWO STORIES HIGH THERE WAS A TIME HOWEVER WHEN THIS CITY BOASTED OF HAVING THE FINEST BUILDING EVER ERECTED BY THE HANDS OF MAN VIZ SOLOMON'S TEMPLE
6308-68358-0020 WHICH WAS A GREAT FLAT MOUNTAIN TOP OF UNEVEN ROCK GREAT ARCHES WERE BUILT AROUND THE SIDES AND THEN THE TOP LEVELED OFF UNTIL THE LARGE TEMPLE AREA WAS FORMED
6308-68358-0021 BELOW THE SIDES OF THIS AREA ARE STILL SEEN THE MASSIVE ROOMS THAT ARE CALLED SOLOMON'S STABLES THE WRITER RAMBLED FOR HOURS THROUGH THESE GREAT UNDERGROUND VAULTS AND SAW THE HOLES IN THE STONE PILLARS
6308-68358-0022 WHERE THE HORSES WERE TIED HERE MULTIPLIED THOUSANDS TOOK REFUGE DURING SOME OF THE MEMORABLE SIEGES THAT THE CITY WENT THROUGH NOT FAR AWAY ARE THE GREAT VAULTS KNOWN AS SOLOMON'S QUARRIES
6308-68358-0023 HERE IS WHERE THE MASSIVE STONES WERE MADE READY AND THE MASTER BUILDER'S PLANS WERE SO PERFECT THAT THERE WAS NEITHER HAMMER NOR AX NOR ANY TOOL OF IRON HEARD IN THE TEMPLE WHILE IT WAS IN BUILDING
6308-68358-0024 THE MARKS OF THE MASON'S TOOLS AND THE NICHES WHERE THEIR LAMPS WERE PLACED CAN BE SEEN TO THIS DAY IT IS A REMARKABLE FACT THAT IN SINKING SHAFTS ALONGSIDE THE TEMPLE WALL GREAT STONES HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED
6308-68358-0025 BUT NO STONE CHIPS ARE FOUND BY THEM THERE ARE NUMERALS AND QUARRY MARKS AND SPECIAL MASON MARKS ON SOME OF THESE STONES BUT THEY ARE ALL PHOENICIAN THUS CONFIRMING THE BIBLE ACCOUNT THAT HIRAM
6308-68358-0026 THE GREAT PHOENICIAN MASTER BUILDER PREPARED THE STONES AND DID THE BUILDING FOR KING SOLOMON JERUSALEM HAS SEVERAL LARGE CHURCHES THE MOST NOTED OF WHICH IS THE ONE BUILT OVER THE TRADITIONAL TOMB OF CHRIST
6308-68358-0027 IT IS CALLED THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE FOR SIXTEEN HUNDRED YEARS THERE WAS NO QUESTION BUT WHAT THIS TOMB WAS THE IDENTICAL ONE IN WHICH THE BODY OF CHRIST WAS LAID
6308-68358-0028 THIS CHURCH AS IT STANDS TODAY IS A MAGNIFICENT BUILDING WITH TWO GREAT ENTRANCES THE SAD THING ABOUT IT IS THE FACT THAT IT IS DIVIDED UP INTO VARIOUS CHAPELS EACH HELD BY SECTS
6308-68358-0029 OF SO CALLED CHRISTIANS AND A LARGE ARMED GUARD HAS TO BE KEPT IN THE CHURCH TO KEEP THESE FANATICAL PEOPLE FROM KILLING EACH OTHER BEFORE SOLDIERS WERE PLACED THERE
6308-68358-0030 SCENES OF CONFLICT AND BLOODSHED WERE VERY COMMON INDEED A SAD SPECTACLE FOR JEWS AND MOSLEMS AND OTHER ENEMIES OF THE CHRIST TO GAZE UPON
6308-68358-0031 I COUNTED THE LORD'S PRAYER IN THIRTY TWO DIFFERENT LANGUAGES INSCRIBED ON MARBLE SLABS SO THAT ALMOST ANY PERSON FROM ANY COUNTRY CAN READ THIS PRAYER IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE
6308-68358-0032 IN THIS CONNECTION IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT AT THE GATE ENTRANCE TO THE POOL OF BETHESDA THE SCRIPTURE STORY OF THE HEALING OF THE IMPOTENT MAN IS WRITTEN OR RATHER INSCRIBED
6308-68358-0033 BENEATH THE ARCH IN FIFTY ONE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ONE OF THE LARGE CHURCHES IN THE CITY WAS DEDICATED BY THE EX KAISER WHEN HE VISITED THE CITY IN EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT IT WAS LATER FOUND OUT
6308-68358-0034 THAT THIS GERMAN CHURCH WAS BUILT FOR MILITARY PURPOSES DURING THE WAR A WIRELESS OUTFIT AND GREAT SEARCHLIGHTS WERE FOUND IN ITS TOWER THIS SELF APPOINTED WORLD RULER
6308-68358-0035 IS REPRESENTED ON THE CEILING OF THE CHAPEL OF A BUILDING ON MOUNT OLIVET IN A COMPANION PANEL WITH THE DEITY IN THIS SAME BUILDING THE EX KAISER IS REPRESENTED AS A CRUSADER BY A FIGURE
6308-68358-0036 AND THE PSALMIST IS PAINTED WITH THE MOUSTACHE OF A GERMAN GENERAL WHEN THE EX KAISER ENTERED THE CITY OF JERUSALEM A BREACH WAS MADE IN THE WALL NEAR THE JAFFA GATE SO INSTEAD OF ENTERING THROUGH THE GATE
6308-68358-0037 LIKE AN ORDINARY MORTAL HE WENT IN THROUGH A HOLE IN THE WALL HE WOULD NO DOUBT BE GLAD NOW TO GO THROUGH ANOTHER HOLE IN THE WALL TO HAVE HIS LIBERTY
6308-68358-0038 TO THE WRITER HOWEVER PERHAPS THE MOST INTERESTING PLACE IN OR ABOUT THE ENTIRE CITY IS THE GARDEN TOMB AND MOUNT CALVARY THIS IS ALMOST NORTH OF THE DAMASCUS GATE
6308-68358-0039 AND ON THE GREAT HIGHWAY FROM JERUSALEM FROM THE NORTH MOUNT CALVARY IS ONLY A SMALL HILL THE JEWS SPEAK OF IT AS THE HILL OF EXECUTION OR THE SKULL PLACE AS THE OUTLINE OF THE HILL
6308-68358-0040 RESEMBLES THE FORM OF A GIGANTIC SKULL IT IS SAID THAT NO JEW CARES TO PASS THIS PLACE AFTER NIGHT AND IF HE PASSES IT IN DAYLIGHT HE WILL MUTTER A CURSE UPON THE MEMORY OF HIM
6308-68358-0041 WHO PRESUMED TO BE THE KING OF THE JEWS NEAR THIS SKULL PLACE IS AN OLD TOMB THAT JUST FITS THE BIBLE NARRATIVE
6308-68358-0042 NOW IN THE PLACE WHERE HE WAS CRUCIFIED THERE WAS A GARDEN AND IN THE GARDEN A NEW SEPULCHRE WHEREIN NEVER MAN WAS YET LAID THIS TOMB WAS DISCOVERED MANY YEARS AGO
6308-68358-0043 BY GENERAL GORDON AND IS OFTEN SPOKEN OF AS GORDON'S TOMB ALSO CALLED THE GARDEN TOMB WHEN EXCAVATING ABOUT IT A WALL WAS FOUND WHICH PROVED TO BE A GARDEN WALL
6308-68358-0044 THE END OF WHICH BUTTS UP AGAINST MOUNT CALVARY ONE WRITER WHO HAS EXAMINED EVERY NOOK AND CORNER SAYS IN REGARD TO THIS TOMB IT STANDS IN THE MASS OF ROCK WHICH FORMS THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY OF A GARDEN
6308-68358-0045 WHICH LITERALLY RUNS INTO THE HILLSIDE TO THE WEST OF MOUNT CALVARY ITSELF ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS NOTED AS THE WRITER WENT INTO THIS TOMB WAS THE FACT THAT IT IS A JEWISH TOMB
6308-68358-0046 THEY MADE THEIR TOMBS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF ANY OTHER PEOPLE THAT IT WAS A RICH MAN'S TOMB IS ALSO VERY CERTAIN AS IS THE FACT THAT IT DATES BACK TO THE HERODIAN PERIOD IN WHICH JESUS LIVED
6308-68358-0047 THERE IS ALSO SOME FRESCOED WORK UPON IT SHOWING THAT IT WAS HELD SACRED BY THE EARLY CHRISTIANS THEN THE ROLLING STONE AND THE GROOVE IN WHICH IT WAS PLACED IS VERY INTERESTING THIS WAS SOMETHING
6308-68358-0048 LIKE A GIGANTIC GRINDSTONE WHICH ROLLED IN THE GROOVE AND WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO COVER THE OPENING WHEN THE TOMB WAS CLOSED WHILE IN AND ABOUT JERUSALEM THE WRITER VISITED THE FAMOUS UPPER ROOM
6308-68358-0049 THE JEW'S WAILING PLACE THE MOSQUE OF OMAR WHICH STANDS UPON THE VERY SPOT WHERE SOLOMON'S TEMPLE USED TO STAND THE WAY OF SORROWS THE ECCO HOMO ARCH
6308-68358-0050 THE CASTLE OF ANTONIO TOWER OF DAVID THE POOL OF SILOAM
