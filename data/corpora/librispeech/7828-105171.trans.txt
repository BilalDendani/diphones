7828-105171-0000 AS THE GIRL TURNED TO BID THEM GOOD NIGHT SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE SAW A SHADOWY FORM MOVING IN THE DARKNESS BEYOND THEM

7828-105171-0012 NO WILD ANIMAL IS PARTICULARLY FOND OF THE FUMES OF TOBACCO
7828-105171-0013 SMITH OLDWICK LIGHTED HIS CIGARETTE AND SAT PUFFING SLOWLY UPON IT HE HAD PROFFERED ONE TO THE GIRL BUT SHE HAD REFUSED AND THUS THEY SAT IN SILENCE FOR SOME TIME THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT RUFFLED OCCASIONALLY BY THE FAINT CRUNCHING OF PADDED FEET UPON THE SOFT SANDS OF THE GORGE'S FLOOR
7828-105171-0014 EVEN CHARGE JUST KNOWING THAT THEY ARE THERE AND OCCASIONALLY SEEING SOMETHING LIKE A SHADOW IN THE DARKNESS AND THE FAINT SOUNDS THAT COME TO US FROM THEM ARE GETTING ON MY NERVES BUT I HOPE HE SAID THAT ALL THREE DON'T CHARGE AT ONCE THREE SAID TARZAN
7828-105171-0015 THERE ARE SEVEN OF THEM OUT THERE NOW GOOD LORD EXCLAIMED SMITH OLDWICK COULDN'T WE BUILD A FIRE ASKED THE GIRL AND FRIGHTEN THEM AWAY
7828-105171-0016 SAID TARZAN AS I HAVE AN IDEA THAT THESE LIONS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM ANY THAT WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH AND POSSIBLY FOR THE SAME REASON WHICH AT FIRST PUZZLED ME A LITTLE I REFER TO THE APPARENT DOCILITY IN THE PRESENCE OF A MAN
7828-105171-0017 OF THE LION WHO WAS WITH US TODAY A MAN IS OUT THERE NOW WITH THOSE LIONS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE EXCLAIMED SMITH OLDWICK THEY WOULD TEAR HIM TO PIECES WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THERE IS A MAN THERE ASKED THE GIRL
7828-105171-0018 WELL SAID TARZAN IF YOU HAD BEEN BORN WITHOUT EYES YOU COULD NOT UNDERSTAND SENSE IMPRESSIONS THAT THE EYES OF OTHERS TRANSMIT TO THEIR BRAINS AND AS YOU HAVE BOTH BEEN BORN WITHOUT ANY SENSE OF SMELL I AM AFRAID YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW I CAN KNOW
7828-105171-0019 THAT THERE IS A MAN THERE YOU MEAN THAT YOU SCENT A MAN ASKED THE GIRL TARZAN NODDED AFFIRMATIVELY AND IN THE SAME WAY YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF LIONS ASKED THE MAN YES SAID TARZAN

7828-105171-0021 WHAT IS IT ASKED THE GIRL
7828-105171-0022 IN OTHER WORDS WE ARE UNDER SURVEILLANCE
7828-105171-0023 WE SHALL NOT BE BOTHERED BUT HOW ARE WE TO KNOW WHERE THEY DON'T WANT US TO GO ASKED SMITH OLDWICK WE CAN'T KNOW REPLIED TARZAN AND THE CHANCES ARE THAT THE VERY PLACE WE ARE SEEKING IS THE PLACE THEY DON'T WISH US TO TRESPASS ON YOU MEAN THE WATER
7828-105171-0024 ASKED THE GIRL YES REPLIED TARZAN FOR SOME TIME THEY SAT IN SILENCE WHICH WAS BROKEN ONLY BY AN OCCASIONAL SOUND OF MOVEMENT FROM THE OUTER DARKNESS IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN HOUR LATER THAT THE APE MAN ROSE QUIETLY AND DREW HIS LONG BLADE FROM ITS SHEATH
7828-105171-0025 SMITH OLDWICK WAS DOZING AGAINST THE ROCKY WALL OF THE CAVERN ENTRANCE WHILE THE GIRL EXHAUSTED BY THE EXCITEMENT AND FATIGUE OF THE DAY HAD FALLEN INTO DEEP SLUMBER AN INSTANT AFTER TARZAN AROSE SMITH OLDWICK AND THE GIRL WERE AROUSED BY A VOLLEY OF THUNDEROUS ROARS
7828-105171-0026 AND THE NOISE OF MANY PADDED FEET RUSHING TOWARD THEM TARZAN OF THE APES STOOD DIRECTLY BEFORE THE ENTRANCE TO THE CAVERN HIS KNIFE IN HIS HAND AWAITING THE CHARGE THE APE MAN HAD NOT EXPECTED ANY SUCH CONCERTED ACTION AS HE NOW REALIZED HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THOSE WATCHING THEM
7828-105171-0027 WHO WERE WITH THE LIONS EARLIER IN THE EVENING AND WHEN HE AROSE TO HIS FEET IT WAS BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT THE LIONS AND THE MEN WERE MOVING CAUTIOUSLY CLOSER TO HIM AND HIS PARTY HE MIGHT EASILY HAVE ELUDED THEM
7828-105171-0028 HE OWED NOTHING EITHER OF DUTY OR FRIENDSHIP TO THE GIRL SLEEPING IN THE CAVERN NOR COULD HE LONGER BE OF ANY PROTECTION TO HER OR HER COMPANION YET SOMETHING HELD HIM THERE IN FUTILE SELF SACRIFICE THE GREAT TARMANGANI
7828-105171-0029 HAD NOT EVEN THE SATISFACTION OF STRIKING A BLOW IN SELF DEFENSE A VERITABLE AVALANCHE OF SAVAGE BEASTS ROLLED OVER HIM AND THREW HIM HEAVILY TO THE GROUND IN FALLING HIS HEAD STRUCK THE ROCKY SURFACE OF THE CLIFF STUNNING HIM
7828-105171-0030 IT WAS DAYLIGHT WHEN HE REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS THE FIRST DIM IMPRESSION BORNE TO HIS AWAKENING MIND WAS A CONFUSION OF SAVAGE SOUNDS WHICH GRADUALLY RESOLVED THEMSELVES INTO THE GROWLING OF LIONS AND THEN LITTLE BY LITTLE
7828-105171-0031 HE SAW THAT A GREAT LION STOOD STRADDLING HIM A GREAT LION WHO GROWLED HIDEOUSLY AT SOMETHING WHICH TARZAN COULD NOT SEE WITH THE FULL RETURN OF HIS SENSES TARZAN'S NOSE TOLD HIM THAT THE BEAST ABOVE HIM WAS NUMA OF THE WAMABO PIT THUS REASSURED
7828-105171-0032 AND AT THE SAME TIME MADE A MOTION AS THOUGH HE WOULD ARISE IMMEDIATELY NUMA STEPPED FROM ABOVE HIM AS TARZAN RAISED HIS HEAD HE SAW THAT HE STILL LAY WHERE HE HAD FALLEN BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE CLIFF
7828-105171-0033 AND THAT NUMA BACKED AGAINST THE CLIFFSIDE WAS APPARENTLY DEFENDING HIM FROM TWO OTHER LIONS WHO PACED TO AND FRO A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THEIR INTENDED VICTIM AND THEN TARZAN TURNED HIS EYES INTO THE CAVE AND SAW THAT THE GIRL AND SMITH OLDWICK WERE GONE
7828-105171-0034 HIS EFFORTS HAD BEEN FOR NAUGHT WITH AN ANGRY TOSS OF HIS HEAD THE APE MAN TURNED UPON THE TWO LIONS WHO HAD CONTINUED TO PACE BACK AND FORTH A FEW YARDS FROM HIM NUMA OF THE LION PIT TURNED A FRIENDLY GLANCE IN TARZAN'S DIRECTION
7828-105171-0035 RUBBED HIS HEAD AGAINST THE APE MAN'S SIDE AND THEN DIRECTED HIS SNARLING COUNTENANCE TOWARD THE TWO HUNTERS I THINK SAID TARZAN TO NUMA THAT YOU AND I TOGETHER CAN MAKE THESE BEASTS VERY UNHAPPY
7828-105171-0036 HE SPOKE IN ENGLISH WHICH OF COURSE NUMA DID NOT UNDERSTAND AT ALL BUT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING REASSURING IN THE TONE
7828-105171-0037 COME SAID TARZAN SUDDENLY AND GRASPING THE LION'S MANE WITH HIS LEFT HAND HE MOVED TOWARD THE OTHER LIONS HIS COMPANION PACING AT HIS SIDE AS THE TWO ADVANCED THE OTHERS DREW SLOWLY BACK AND FINALLY SEPARATING MOVED OFF TO EITHER SIDE
7828-105171-0038 TARZAN AND NUMA PASSED BETWEEN THEM BUT NEITHER THE GREAT BLACK MANED LION NOR THE MAN FAILED TO KEEP AN EYE UPON THE BEAST NEARER HIM SO THAT THEY WERE NOT CAUGHT UNAWARES WHEN AS THOUGH AT SOME PRECONCERTED SIGNAL
7828-105171-0039 WOULD HAVE BEEN SUICIDAL EVEN FOR THE GIANT TARMANGANI INSTEAD HE RESORTED TO METHODS OF AGILITY AND CUNNING FOR QUICK AS ARE THE GREAT CATS EVEN QUICKER IS TARZAN OF THE APES WITH OUTSPREAD RAKING TALONS AND BARED FANGS
7828-105171-0040 NUMA SPRANG FOR THE NAKED CHEST OF THE APE MAN THROWING UP HIS LEFT ARM AS A BOXER MIGHT WARD OFF A BLOW TARZAN STRUCK UPWARD BENEATH THE LEFT FOREARM OF THE LION AT THE SAME TIME RUSHING IN WITH HIS SHOULDER BENEATH THE ANIMAL'S BODY
7828-105171-0041 AND SIMULTANEOUSLY DROVE HIS BLADE INTO THE TAWNY HIDE BEHIND THE SHOULDER
7828-105171-0042 NOW INDEED WOULD HE EXTERMINATE THIS PRESUMPTUOUS MAN THING
7828-105171-0043 BUT AS HE WHEELED HIS INTENDED QUARRY WHEELED WITH HIM BROWN FINGERS LOCKED IN THE HEAVY MANE ON THE POWERFUL NECK
7828-105171-0044 SO EASY IT HAD SEEMED BEFORE THAT HE EXPERIENCED A SHARP FEELING OF RESENTMENT THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO DO SO NOW
7828-105171-0045 AND PRESENTLY TO HIS DISMAY AS THE LION LEAPED AND THREW HIM ABOUT THE APE MAN REALIZED THAT HE WAS SWINGING INEVITABLY BENEATH THOSE FRIGHTFUL TALONS WITH A FINAL EFFORT HE THREW HIMSELF FROM NUMA'S BACK AND SOUGHT BY HIS QUICKNESS TO ELUDE THE FRENZIED BEAST
7828-105171-0046 FOR THE FRACTION OF AN INSTANT THAT WOULD PERMIT HIM TO REGAIN HIS FEET AND MEET THE ANIMAL AGAIN UPON A MORE EVEN FOOTING BUT THIS TIME NUMA WAS TOO QUICK FOR HIM
7828-105171-0047 AND BOWLED HIM OVER AS HE FELL HE SAW A BLACK STREAK SHOOT ABOVE HIM AND ANOTHER LION CLOSE UPON HIS ANTAGONIST ROLLING FROM BENEATH THE TWO BATTLING LIONS TARZAN REGAINED HIS FEET
7828-105171-0048 THOUGH HE WAS HALF DAZED AND STAGGERING FROM THE IMPACT OF THE TERRIBLE BLOW HE HAD RECEIVED BEHIND HIM HE SAW A LIFELESS LION LYING TORN AND BLEEDING UPON THE SAND AND BEFORE HIM NUMA OF THE PIT WAS SAVAGELY MAULING THE SECOND LION
7828-105171-0049 HE OF THE BLACK COAT TREMENDOUSLY OUTCLASSED HIS ADVERSARY IN POINT OF SIZE AND STRENGTH AS WELL AS IN FEROCITY
7828-105171-0050 AND PASSES AT EACH OTHER BEFORE THE LARGER SUCCEEDED IN FASTENING HIS FANGS IN THE OTHER'S THROAT AND THEN AS A CAT SHAKES A MOUSE THE LARGER LION SHOOK THE LESSER AND WHEN HIS DYING FOE SOUGHT TO ROLL BENEATH AND RAKE HIS CONQUEROR WITH HIS HIND CLAWS
7828-105171-0051 THE OTHER MET HIM HALFWAY AT HIS OWN GAME
7828-105171-0052 AND THEN WERE RAKED DOWNWARD WITH ALL THE TERRIFIC STRENGTH OF THE MIGHTY HIND LEGS THE BATTLE WAS ENDED AS NUMA ROSE FROM HIS SECOND VICTIM AND SHOOK HIMSELF TARZAN COULD NOT BUT AGAIN NOTE THE WONDROUS PROPORTIONS AND SYMMETRY OF THE BEAST
7828-105171-0053 THAN AN ORDINARY BLACK MANED LION BUT THE TAWNY SHADE ON THE BALANCE OF THEIR COATS PREDOMINATED HOWEVER
7828-105171-0054 FROM ANY HE HAD SEEN AS THOUGH THEY HAD SPRUNG ORIGINALLY FROM A CROSS BETWEEN THE FOREST LION OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE AND A BREED OF WHICH NUMA OF THE PIT MIGHT BE TYPICAL THE IMMEDIATE OBSTRUCTION IN HIS WAY HAVING BEEN REMOVED
7828-105171-0055 TARZAN WAS FOR SETTING OUT IN SEARCH OF THE SPOOR OF THE GIRL AND SMITH OLDWICK THAT HE MIGHT DISCOVER THEIR FATE HE SUDDENLY FOUND HIMSELF TREMENDOUSLY HUNGRY AND AS HE CIRCLED ABOUT OVER THE SANDY BOTTOM SEARCHING AMONG THE TANGLED NETWORK OF INNUMERABLE TRACKS
7828-105171-0056 FOR THOSE OF HIS PROTEGES THERE BROKE FROM HIS LIPS INVOLUNTARILY THE WHINE OF A HUNGRY BEAST IMMEDIATELY NUMA OF THE PIT PRICKED UP HIS EARS AND REGARDING THE APE MAN STEADILY FOR A MOMENT HE ANSWERED THE CALL OF HUNGER
7828-105171-0057 AND STARTED BRISKLY OFF TOWARD THE SOUTH STOPPING OCCASIONALLY TO SEE IF TARZAN WAS FOLLOWING THE APE MAN REALIZED THAT THE BEAST WAS LEADING HIM TO FOOD AND SO HE FOLLOWED
7828-105171-0058 AND AS HE FOLLOWED HIS KEEN EYES AND SENSITIVE NOSTRILS SOUGHT FOR SOME INDICATION OF THE DIRECTION TAKEN BY THE MAN AND THE GIRL PRESENTLY OUT OF THE MASS OF LION TRACKS
7828-105171-0059 AND MEN AND LIONS IN FRONT AND BEHIND
7828-105171-0060 BUT IN THE LIGHT OF ANY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE HE COULD NOT EXPLAIN SATISFACTORILY TO HIMSELF WHAT HIS PERCEPTIONS INDICATED THERE WAS LITTLE CHANGE IN THE FORMATION OF THE GORGE IT STILL WOUND ITS ERRATIC COURSE BETWEEN PRECIPITOUS CLIFFS
7828-105171-0061 IN PLACES IT WIDENED OUT AND AGAIN IT BECAME VERY NARROW AND ALWAYS DEEPER THE FURTHER SOUTH THEY TRAVELED PRESENTLY THE BOTTOM OF THE GORGE BEGAN TO SLOPE MORE RAPIDLY HERE AND THERE WERE INDICATIONS OF ANCIENT RAPIDS AND WATERFALLS
7828-105171-0062 THE TRAIL BECAME MORE DIFFICULT BUT WAS WELL MARKED AND SHOWED INDICATIONS OF GREAT ANTIQUITY AND IN PLACES THE HANDIWORK OF MAN
7828-105171-0063 WHEN AT A TURNING OF THE GORGE TARZAN SAW BEFORE HIM A NARROW VALLEY CUT DEEP INTO THE LIVING ROCK OF THE EARTH'S CRUST WITH LOFTY MOUNTAIN RANGES BOUNDING IT UPON THE SOUTH HOW FAR IT EXTENDED EAST AND WEST HE COULD NOT SEE
7828-105171-0064 BUT APPARENTLY IT WAS NO MORE THAN THREE OR FOUR MILES ACROSS FROM NORTH TO SOUTH THAT IT WAS A WELL WATERED VALLEY WAS INDICATED BY THE WEALTH OF VEGETATION THAT CARPETED ITS FLOOR FROM THE ROCKY CLIFFS UPON THE NORTH TO THE MOUNTAINS ON THE SOUTH
7828-105171-0065 BEFORE HIM THE TRAIL WOUND ONWARD TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE VALLEY RAUCOUS VOICED BIRDS OF BRILLIANT PLUMAGE SCREAMED AMONG THE BRANCHES WHILE INNUMERABLE MONKEYS CHATTERED AND SCOLDED ABOVE HIM THE FOREST TEEMED WITH LIFE AND YET THERE WAS BORNE IN UPON THE APE MAN
7828-105171-0066 PROCEEDED TO EAT SUCH OF THE FRUIT AS HE SAW THE MONKEYS ATE IN SAFETY
