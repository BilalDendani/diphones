713-115881-0000 A SLAVE MOTHER LOSES HER SPEECH AT THE SALE OF HER CHILD BOB ESCAPES FROM HIS MASTER A TRADER
713-115881-0001 MARY FLED FROM PETERSBURG AND THE ROBINSONS FROM RICHMOND
713-115881-0002 AND WOULD BRING ANY KIND OF FREIGHT THAT WOULD PAY THE MOST WAS THE CONDUCTOR IN THIS INSTANCE
713-115881-0003 AVAILED THEMSELVES OF HIS ACCOMMODATIONS AND THUS SUCCEEDED IN REACHING CANADA HIS RISK WAS VERY GREAT ON THIS ACCOUNT HE CLAIMED AS DID CERTAIN OTHERS THAT IT WAS NO MORE THAN FAIR TO CHARGE FOR HIS SERVICES
713-115881-0004 INDEED HE DID NOT PROFESS TO BRING PERSONS FOR NOTHING EXCEPT IN RARE INSTANCES
713-115881-0005 FURTHER THAN TO SUGGEST THAT WHATEVER UNDERSTANDING WAS AGREED UPON BY THE PARTIES THEMSELVES SHOULD BE FAITHFULLY ADHERED TO MANY SLAVES IN CITIES COULD RAISE BY HOOK OR BY CROOK FIFTY OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO PAY FOR A PASSAGE
713-115881-0006 THUS WHILE THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE OF PHILADELPHIA ESPECIALLY NEITHER CHARGED NOR ACCEPTED ANYTHING FOR THEIR SERVICES IT WAS NOT TO BE EXPECTED THAT ANY OF THE SOUTHERN AGENTS COULD AFFORD TO DO LIKEWISE
713-115881-0007 THE HUSBAND OF MARY HAD FOR A LONG TIME WANTED HIS OWN FREEDOM BUT DID NOT FEEL THAT HE COULD GO WITHOUT HIS WIFE IN FACT HE RESOLVED TO GET HER OFF FIRST THEN TO TRY AND ESCAPE HIMSELF IF POSSIBLE
713-115881-0008 THE FIRST ESSENTIAL STEP TOWARDS SUCCESS HE CONSIDERED WAS TO SAVE HIS MONEY AND MAKE IT AN OBJECT TO THE CAPTAIN TO HELP HIM SO WHEN HE HAD MANAGED TO LAY BY ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS HE WILLINGLY OFFERED THIS SUM TO CAPTAIN B
713-115881-0009 THE CAPTAIN AGREED TO THE TERMS AND FULFILLED HIS ENGAGEMENT TO THE LETTER ABOUT THE FIRST OF MARCH EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE MARY WAS PRESENTED TO THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE SHE WAS OF AGREEABLE MANNERS ABOUT FORTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE
713-115881-0010 DARK COMPLEXION ROUND BUILT AND INTELLIGENT SHE HAD BEEN THE MOTHER OF FIFTEEN CHILDREN FOUR OF WHOM HAD BEEN SOLD AWAY FROM HER ONE WAS STILL HELD IN SLAVERY IN PETERSBURG THE OTHERS WERE ALL DEAD
713-115881-0011 AT THE SALE OF ONE OF HER CHILDREN SHE WAS SO AFFECTED WITH GRIEF THAT SHE WAS THROWN INTO VIOLENT CONVULSIONS
713-115881-0012 BUT THIS LITTLE EPISODE WAS NOT A MATTER TO EXCITE SYMPATHY IN THE BREASTS OF THE HIGHLY REFINED AND TENDER HEARTED CHRISTIAN MOTHERS OF PETERSBURG IN THE MERCY OF PROVIDENCE HOWEVER HER REASON AND STRENGTH RETURNED
713-115881-0013 SHE HAD FORMERLY BELONGED TO THE LATE LITTLETON REEVES WHOM SHE REPRESENTED AS HAVING BEEN KIND TO HER MUCH MORE SO THAN HER MISTRESS MISSUS REEVES SAID MARY SHE BEING OF A JEALOUS DISPOSITION
713-115881-0014 CAUSED ME TO BE HIRED OUT WITH A HARD FAMILY WHERE I WAS MUCH ABUSED FREQUENTLY FLOGGED AND STINTED FOR FOOD ET CETERA BUT THE SWEETS OF FREEDOM IN THE CARE OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE NOW DELIGHTED HER MIND
713-115881-0015 AND THE HOPE THAT HER HUSBAND WOULD SOON FOLLOW HER TO CANADA INSPIRED HER WITH EXPECTATIONS THAT SHE WOULD ONE DAY SIT UNDER HER OWN VINE AND FIG TREE WHERE NONE DARED TO MOLEST OR MAKE HER AFRAID
713-115881-0016 THE COMMITTEE RENDERED HER THE USUAL ASSISTANCE AND IN DUE TIME FORWARDED HER ON TO QUEEN VICTORIA'S FREE LAND IN CANADA ON HER ARRIVAL SHE WROTE BACK AS FOLLOWS TORONTO MARCH FOURTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE
713-115881-0017 I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY OF ADDRESSING YOU WITH THESE FEW LINES TO INFORM YOU THAT I ARRIVED HERE TO DAY AND HOPE THAT THIS MAY FIND YOURSELF AND MISSUS STILL WELL AS THIS LEAVES ME AT THE PRESENT I WILL ALSO SAY TO YOU
713-115881-0018 THAT I HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN GETTING ALONG THE TWO YOUNG MEN THAT WAS WITH ME LEFT ME AT SUSPENSION BRIDGE THEY WENT ANOTHER WAY I CANNOT SAY MUCH ABOUT THE PLACE AS I HAVE BEN HERE BUT A SHORT TIME BUT SO FAR AS I HAVE SEEN I LIKE VERY WELL
713-115881-0019 YOU WILL GIVE MY RESPECT TO YOUR LADY AND MISTER AND MISSUS BROWN IF YOU HAVE NOT WRITTEN TO PETERSBURG YOU WILL PLEASE TO WRITE AS SOON AS CAN I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO WRITE AT PRESENT BUT YOURS RESPECTFULLY EMMA BROWN
713-115881-0020 OLD NAME MARY EPPS NOW JOSEPH AND ROBERT MARY'S ASSOCIATE PASSENGERS FROM RICHMOND MUST HERE BE NOTICED JOSEPH WAS OF A DARK ORANGE COLOR MEDIUM SIZE VERY ACTIVE AND INTELLIGENT
713-115881-0021 AND DOUBTLESS WELL UNDERSTOOD THE ART OF BEHAVING HIMSELF HE WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE AUCTION BLOCK HAVING BEEN SOLD THREE TIMES AND HAD HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF A CRUEL MASTER EACH TIME
713-115881-0022 UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES HE HAD HAD BUT FEW PRIVILEGES SUNDAYS AND WEEK DAYS ALIKE HE WAS KEPT PRETTY SEVERELY BENT DOWN TO DUTY HE HAD BEEN BEATEN AND KNOCKED AROUND SHAMEFULLY HE HAD A WIFE
713-115881-0023 AND SPOKE OF HER IN MOST ENDEARING LANGUAGE ALTHOUGH ON LEAVING HE DID NOT FEEL AT LIBERTY TO APPRISE HER OF HIS MOVEMENTS FEARING THAT IT WOULD NOT BE SAFE SO TO DO HIS FOUR LITTLE CHILDREN TO WHOM HE APPEARED WARMLY ATTACHED
713-115881-0024 HE LEFT AS HE DID HIS WIFE IN SLAVERY HE DECLARED THAT HE STUCK TO THEM AS LONG AS HE COULD GEORGE E SADLER THE KEEPER OF AN OYSTER HOUSE HELD THE DEED FOR JOE
713-115881-0025 AND A MOST HEARTLESS WRETCH HE WAS IN JOE'S ESTIMATION THE TRUTH WAS JOE COULD NOT STAND THE BURDENS AND ABUSES WHICH SADLER WAS INCLINED TO HEAP UPON HIM SO HE CONCLUDED TO JOIN HIS BROTHER
713-115881-0026 ROBERT HIS YOUNGER BROTHER
713-115881-0027 A REGULAR NEGRO TRADER EIGHT YEARS THIS SLAVE'S DUTIES HAD BEEN AT THE SLAVE PRISON AND AMONG OTHER DAILY OFFICES HE HAD TO ATTEND TO WAS TO LOCK UP THE PRISON
713-115881-0028 ROBERT WAS A VERY INTELLIGENT YOUNG MAN AND FROM LONG AND DAILY EXPERIENCE WITH THE CUSTOMS AND USAGES OF THE SLAVE PRISON HE WAS AS FAMILIAR WITH THE BUSINESS AS A PENNSYLVANIA FARMER WITH HIS BARN YARD STOCK
713-115881-0029 HIS ACCOUNT OF THINGS WAS TOO HARROWING FOR DETAIL HERE EXCEPT IN THE BRIEFEST MANNER AND THAT ONLY WITH REFERENCE TO A FEW PARTICULARS IN ORDER TO PREPARE SLAVES FOR THE MARKET
713-115881-0030 IT WAS USUAL TO HAVE THEM GREASED AND RUBBED TO MAKE THEM LOOK BRIGHT AND SHINING AND HE WENT ON FURTHER TO STATE THAT FEMALES AS WELL AS MALES WERE NOT UNCOMMONLY STRIPPED NAKED LASHED FLAT TO A BENCH AND THEN HELD BY TWO MEN SOMETIMES FOUR
713-115881-0031 WHILE THE BRUTAL TRADER WOULD STRAP THEM WITH A BROAD LEATHER STRAP THE STRAP BEING PREFERRED TO THE COW HIDE AS IT WOULD NOT BREAK THE SKIN AND DAMAGE THE SALE ONE HUNDRED LASHES WOULD ONLY BE A COMMON FLOGGING
713-115881-0032 THE SEPARATION OF FAMILIES WAS THOUGHT NOTHING OF OFTEN I HAVE BEEN FLOGGED FOR REFUSING TO FLOG OTHERS WHILE NOT YET TWENTY THREE YEARS OF AGE ROBERT EXPRESSED HIMSELF
713-115881-0033 AS HAVING BECOME SO DAILY SICK OF THE BRUTALITY AND SUFFERING HE COULD NOT HELP WITNESSING THAT HE FELT HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY STAND IT ANY LONGER LET THE COST BE WHAT IT MIGHT IN THIS STATE OF MIND HE MET WITH CAPTAIN B
713-115881-0034 ONLY ONE OBSTACLE STOOD IN HIS WAY MATERIAL AID IT OCCURRED TO ROBERT THAT HE HAD FREQUENT ACCESS TO THE MONEY DRAWER AND OFTEN IT CONTAINED THE PROCEEDS OF FRESH SALES OF FLESH AND BLOOD
713-115881-0035 AND HE REASONED THAT IF SOME OF THAT WOULD HELP HIM AND HIS BROTHER TO FREEDOM THERE COULD BE NO HARM IN HELPING HIMSELF THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THE CAPTAIN WAS ALL READY AND PROVIDED HE COULD GET THREE PASSENGERS AT ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH
713-115881-0036 HE WOULD SET SAIL WITHOUT MUCH OTHER FREIGHT OF COURSE HE WAS TOO SHREWD TO GET OUT PAPERS FOR PHILADELPHIA THAT WOULD BETRAY HIM AT ONCE WASHINGTON OR BALTIMORE
713-115881-0037 WERE NAMES WHICH STOOD FAIR IN THE EYES OF VIRGINIA CONSEQUENTLY BEING ABLE TO PACK THE FUGITIVES AWAY IN A VERY PRIVATE HOLE OF HIS BOAT AND BEING ONLY BOUND FOR A SOUTHERN PORT THE CAPTAIN WAS WILLING TO RISK HIS SHARE OF THE DANGER
713-115881-0038 VERY WELL SAID ROBERT TO DAY I WILL PLEASE MY MASTER SO WELL THAT I WILL CATCH HIM AT AN UNGUARDED MOMENT
713-115881-0039 AND WILL ASK HIM FOR A PASS TO GO TO A BALL TO NIGHT SLAVE HOLDERS LOVE TO SEE THEIR SLAVES FIDDLING AND DANCING OF NIGHTS AND AS I SHALL BE LEAVING IN A HURRY I WILL TAKE A GRAB FROM THE DAY'S SALE AND WHEN SLATER HEARS OF ME AGAIN I WILL BE IN CANADA
713-115881-0040 SO AFTER HAVING ATTENDED TO ALL HIS DISAGREEABLE DUTIES HE MADE HIS GRAB AND GOT A HAND FULL HE DID NOT KNOW HOWEVER HOW IT WOULD HOLD OUT THAT EVENING INSTEAD OF PARTICIPATING WITH THE GAY DANCERS
713-115881-0041 WITH SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AFTER PAYING THE WORTHY CAPTAIN ONE HUNDRED EACH FOR HIMSELF AND HIS BROTHER BESIDES MAKING THE CAPTAIN AN ADDITIONAL PRESENT OF NEARLY ONE HUNDRED WIND AND TIDE WERE NOW
713-115881-0042 UNTIL THEY MIGHT REACH THE DEPOT AT PHILADELPHIA THE RICHMOND DISPATCH AN ENTERPRISING PAPER IN THE INTEREST OF SLAVEHOLDERS WHICH CAME DAILY TO THE COMMITTEE WAS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE OF THE PASSENGERS
713-115881-0043 WHEN LO AND BEHOLD IN TURNING TO THE INTERESTING COLUMN CONTAINING THE ELEGANT ILLUSTRATIONS OF RUNAWAY NEGROES IT WAS SEEN THAT THE UNFORTUNATE SLATER
713-115881-0044 IN NORTH CAROLINA MONEY AND ALSO HIS DARK ORANGE COLORED INTELLIGENT AND GOOD LOOKING TURNKEY BOB SERVED HIM RIGHT IT IS NO STEALING FOR ONE PIECE OF PROPERTY TO GO OFF WITH ANOTHER PIECE REASONED A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE
713-115881-0045 IN A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER THE DISPATCH BROUGHT THE NEWS
713-115881-0046 WERE SAFELY LANDED AT THE USUAL PLACE AND SO ACCURATE WERE THE DESCRIPTIONS IN THE PAPER THAT ON FIRST SEEING THEM THE COMMITTEE RECOGNIZED THEM INSTANTLY AND WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS CEREMONIES
713-115881-0047 AND PUT THE QUESTION TO THEM DIRECT ARE YOU THE ONES WE ARE THEY OWNED UP WITHOUT HESITATION THE COMMITTEE DID NOT SEE A DOLLAR OF THEIR MONEY BUT UNDERSTOOD THEY HAD ABOUT NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS AFTER PAYING THE CAPTAIN WHILE BOB CONSIDERED
713-115881-0048 HE MADE A VERY GOOD GRAB HE DID NOT ADMIT THAT THE AMOUNT ADVERTISED WAS CORRECT AFTER A REASONABLE TIME FOR RECRUITING HAVING BEEN SO LONG IN THE HOLE OF THE VESSEL THEY TOOK THEIR DEPARTURE FOR CANADA FROM JOSEPH THE ELDER BROTHER
713-115881-0049 IS APPENDED A SHORT LETTER ANNOUNCING THEIR ARRIVAL AND CONDITION UNDER THE BRITISH LION SAINT CATHARINE APRIL SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE
713-115881-0050 YOUR LETTER OF DATE APRIL SEVENTH I HAVE JUST GOT IT HAD BEEN OPENED BEFORE IT CAME TO ME I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY OTHER LETTER FROM YOU AND CAN GET NO ACCOUNT OF THEM IN THE POST OFFICE IN THIS PLACE
713-115881-0051 I AM WELL AND HAVE GOT A GOOD SITUATION IN THIS CITY AND INTEND STAYING HERE
713-115881-0052 MY BROTHER IS ALSO AT WORK WITH ME AND DOING WELL THERE IS NOTHING HERE THAT WOULD INTEREST YOU IN THE WAY OF NEWS THERE IS A MASONIC LODGE OF OUR PEOPLE AND TWO CHURCHES AND SOCIETYS HERE AND SOME OTHER INSTITUTIONS FOR OUR BENEFIT
713-115881-0053 BE KIND ENOUGH TO SEND A FEW LINES TO THE LADY SPOKEN OF FOR THAT MOCKING BIRD AND MUCH OBLIGE ME WRITE ME SOON AND BELIEVE ME YOUR OBEDIENT SERV'T LOVE AND RESPECTS TO LADY AND DAUGHTER JOSEPH ROBINSON
713-115881-0054 AS WELL AS WRITING TO A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE JOE AND BOB HAD THE ASSURANCE TO WRITE BACK TO THE TRADER AND OYSTER HOUSE KEEPER IN THEIR LETTER THEY STATED THAT THEY HAD ARRIVED SAFELY IN CANADA AND WERE HAVING GOOD TIMES
713-115881-0055 IN THE EATING LINE HAD AN ABUNDANCE OF THE BEST ALSO HAD VERY CHOICE WINES AND BRANDIES WHICH THEY SUPPOSED THAT THEY TRADER AND OYSTER HOUSE KEEPER WOULD GIVE A GREAT DEAL TO HAVE A SMACK AT AND THEN THEY GAVE THEM A VERY CORDIAL INVITATION TO MAKE THEM A VISIT
713-115881-0056 AND WITHOUT FIRST GREASING THEMSELVES AND THEN HANGING ON VERY FAST THE JOURNEY MIGHT NOT PROVE ALTOGETHER ADVANTAGEOUS TO THEM THIS WAS WORMWOOD AND GALL TO THE TRADER AND OYSTER HOUSE MAN A MOST REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE WAS THAT
713-115881-0057 THE CAPTAIN WHO BROUGHT AWAY THE THREE PASSENGERS MADE IT HIS BUSINESS FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER TO CALL AT THE OYSTER HOUSE KEPT BY THE OWNER OF JOE AND WHILE THERE THIS LETTER WAS READ AND COMMENTED ON IN TORRENTS OF BILLINGSGATE PHRASES
713-115881-0058 AND THE TRADER TOLD THE CAPTAIN THAT HE WOULD GIVE HIM TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IF HE WOULD GET THEM FINALLY HE TOLD HIM HE WOULD GIVE EVERY CENT THEY WOULD BRING WHICH WOULD BE MUCH OVER TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AS THEY WERE SO VERY LIKELY
713-115881-0059 HOW FAR THE CAPTAIN TALKED APPROVINGLY HE DID NOT EXACTLY TELL THE COMMITTEE BUT THEY GUESSED HE TALKED STRONG DEMOCRATIC DOCTRINE TO THEM UNDER THE FRIGHTFUL CIRCUMSTANCES
