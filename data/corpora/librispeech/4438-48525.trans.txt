4438-48525-0000 EARLY IN THEIR ENGAGEMENT WEMYSS HAD EXPOUNDED HIS THEORY TO LUCY THAT THERE SHOULD BE THE MOST PERFECT FRANKNESS BETWEEN LOVERS WHILE AS FOR HUSBAND AND WIFE THERE OUGHTN'T TO BE A CORNER ANYWHERE ABOUT EITHER OF THEM MIND BODY OR SOUL
4438-48525-0001 WHICH COULDN'T BE REVEALED TO THE OTHER ONE YOU CAN TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING TO YOUR EVERARD HE ASSURED HER TELL HIM YOUR INNERMOST THOUGHTS WHATEVER THEY MAY BE YOU NEED NO MORE BE ASHAMED OF TELLING HIM THAN OF THINKING THEM BY YOURSELF
4438-48525-0002 HE IS YOU YOU AND HE ARE ONE IN MIND AND SOUL NOW AND WHEN HE IS YOUR HUSBAND YOU AND HE WILL BECOME PERFECT AND COMPLETE BY BEING ONE IN BODY AS WELL EVERARD LUCY LUCY EVERARD
4438-48525-0003 AND FELL TO KISSING HIM INSTEAD WHAT IDEAL HAPPINESS TO BE FOR EVER REMOVED FROM THE FEAR OF LONELINESS BY THE SIMPLE EXPEDIENT OF BEING DOUBLED AND WHO SO HAPPY AS HERSELF
4438-48525-0004 ONE SHE COULD SO PERFECTLY AGREE WITH AND UNDERSTAND SHE FELT QUITE SORRY SHE HAD NOTHING IN HER MIND IN THE WAY OF THOUGHTS SHE WAS ASHAMED OF TO TELL HIM THEN AND THERE BUT THERE WASN'T A DOUBT
4438-48525-0005 THERE WASN'T A TRACE OF SEDIMENT BUT MARRIAGE OR WAS IT SLEEPLESSNESS COMPLETELY CHANGED THIS AND THERE WERE PERFECT CROWDS OF THOUGHTS IN HER MIND THAT SHE WAS THOROUGHLY ASHAMED OF
4438-48525-0006 REMEMBERING HIS WORDS AND WHOLE HEARTEDLY AGREEING
4438-48525-0007 TO HAVE NO CONCEALMENTS WAS REAL MARRIAGE THE DAY AFTER HER WEDDING SHE FIRST OF ALL REMINDED HIM OF WHAT HE HAD SAID THEN PLUNGED BRAVELY INTO THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT SHE'D GOT A THOUGHT SHE WAS ASHAMED OF WEMYSS PRICKED UP HIS EARS
4438-48525-0008 THINKING IT WAS SOMETHING INTERESTING TO DO WITH SEX AND WAITED WITH AN AMUSED INQUISITIVE SMILE BUT LUCY IN SUCH MATTERS WAS CONTENT TO FOLLOW HIM AWARE OF HER WANT OF EXPERIENCE AND OF THE ABUNDANCE OF HIS
4438-48525-0009 AND THE THOUGHT THAT WAS WORRYING HER ONLY HAD TO DO WITH A WAITER A WAITER IF YOU PLEASE WEMYSS'S SMILE DIED AWAY HE HAD HAD OCCASION TO REPRIMAND THIS WAITER AT LUNCH FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE
4438-48525-0010 AND HERE WAS LUCY ALLEGING HE HAD DONE SO WITHOUT ANY REASON THAT SHE COULD SEE AND ANYHOW ROUGHLY WOULD HE REMOVE THE FEELING OF DISCOMFORT SHE HAD AT BEING FORCED TO THINK HER OWN HEART'S BELOVED
4438-48525-0011 THE KINDEST AND GENTLEST OF MEN HADN'T BEEN KIND AND GENTLE BUT UNJUST BY EXPLAINING WELL THAT WAS AT THE VERY BEGINNING SHE SOON LEARNED THAT A DOUBT IN HER MIND WAS BETTER KEPT THERE
4438-48525-0012 IF SHE BROUGHT IT OUT TO AIR IT AND DISPEL IT BY TALKING IT OVER WITH HIM ALL THAT HAPPENED WAS THAT HE WAS HURT AND WHEN HE WAS HURT SHE INSTANTLY BECAME PERFECTLY MISERABLE
4438-48525-0013 SEEING THEN THAT THIS HAPPENED ABOUT SMALL THINGS HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS TO TALK WITH HIM OF BIG THINGS OF ESPECIALLY HER IMMENSE DOUBT IN REGARD TO THE WILLOWS
4438-48525-0014 FOR A LONG WHILE SHE WAS SURE HE WAS BEARING HER FEELING IN MIND SINCE IT COULDN'T HAVE CHANGED SINCE CHRISTMAS AND THAT WHEN SHE ARRIVED THERE SHE WOULD FIND THAT HE HAD HAD EVERYTHING ALTERED AND ALL TRACES OF VERA'S LIFE THERE REMOVED
4438-48525-0015 THEN WHEN HE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT THE WILLOWS SHE FOUND THAT SUCH AN IDEA AS ALTERATIONS HADN'T ENTERED HIS HEAD SHE WAS TO SLEEP IN THE VERY ROOM THAT HAD BEEN HIS AND VERA'S IN THE VERY BED AND POSITIVELY
4438-48525-0016 SO FAR WAS IT FROM TRUE THAT SHE COULD TELL HIM EVERY THOUGHT AND TALK EVERYTHING OVER WITH HIM WHEN SHE DISCOVERED THIS SHE WASN'T ABLE TO SAY MORE THAN THAT HESITATING REMARK ON THE CHATEAU TERRACE AT AMBOISE ABOUT SUPPOSING HE WAS GOING TO CHANGE HIS BEDROOM
4438-48525-0017 YET THE WILLOWS HAUNTED HER AND WHAT A COMFORT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO TELL HIM ALL SHE FELT AND LET HIM HELP HER TO GET RID OF HER GROWING OBSESSION BY LAUGHING AT HER WHAT A COMFORT IF
4438-48525-0018 EVEN IF HE HAD THOUGHT HER TOO SILLY AND MORBID TO BE LAUGHED AT
4438-48525-0019 BUT ONE LEARNS A LOT ON A HONEYMOON LUCY REFLECTED AND ONE OF THE THINGS SHE HAD LEARNED WAS THAT WEMYSS'S MIND WAS ALWAYS MADE UP THERE SEEMED TO BE NO MOMENT WHEN IT WAS IN A CONDITION OF BECOMING
4438-48525-0020 AND SHE MIGHT HAVE SLIPPED IN A SUGGESTION OR LAID A WISH BEFORE HIM HIS PLANS WERE SPRUNG UPON HER FULL FLEDGED AND THEY WERE UNALTERABLE SOMETIMES HE SAID WOULD YOU LIKE
4438-48525-0021 AND IF SHE DIDN'T LIKE AND ANSWERED TRUTHFULLY AS SHE ANSWERED AT FIRST BEFORE SHE LEARNED NOT TO THERE WAS TROUBLE SILENT TROUBLE
4438-48525-0022 FOR HIS QUESTION WAS ONLY DECORATIVE AND HIS LITTLE LOVE SHOULD INSTINCTIVELY HE CONSIDERED LIKE WHAT HE LIKED AND THERE OUTSIDE THIS ALOOFNESS AFTER EFFORTS TO GET AT HIM WITH FOND AND ANXIOUS QUESTIONS
4438-48525-0023 SHE SAT LIKE A BEGGAR IN PATIENT DISTRESS WAITING FOR HIM TO EMERGE AND BE KIND TO HER OF COURSE AS FAR AS THE MINOR WISHES AND PREFERENCES OF EVERY DAY WENT IT WAS ALL QUITE EASY ONCE SHE HAD GRASPED THE RIGHT ANSWER TO THE QUESTION
4438-48525-0024 SHE INSTANTLY DID LIKE OH YES VERY MUCH SHE HASTENED TO ASSURE HIM AND THEN HIS FACE CONTINUED CONTENT AND HAPPY INSTEAD OF CLOUDING WITH AGGRIEVEMENT BUT ABOUT THE BIG THINGS IT WASN'T EASY
4438-48525-0025 BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING THE RIGHT FLAVOUR OF ENTHUSIASM INTO HER VOICE
4438-48525-0026 AND TURN HER TO THE LIGHT AND REPEAT THE QUESTION IN A SOLEMN VOICE PRECURSOR SHE HAD LEARNED OF THE BEGINNING OF THE CLOUD ON HIS FACE HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS SOMETIMES WHEN HE SAID TO HER
4438-48525-0027 YOU'LL LIKE THE VIEW FROM YOUR SITTING ROOM AT THE WILLOWS SHE NATURALLY WANTED TO CRY OUT THAT SHE WOULDN'T AND ASK HIM HOW HE COULD SUPPOSE SHE WOULD LIKE WHAT WAS TO HER A VIEW FOR EVER ASSOCIATED WITH DEATH
4438-48525-0028 WHY SHOULDN'T SHE BE ABLE TO CRY OUT NATURALLY IF SHE WANTED TO TO TALK TO HIM FRANKLY TO GET HIS HELP TO CURE HERSELF OF WHAT WAS SO RIDICULOUS BY LAUGHING AT IT WITH HIM SHE COULDN'T LAUGH ALL ALONE
4438-48525-0029 THOUGH SHE WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO WITH HIM SHE COULD HAVE AND SO HAVE BECOME QUITE SENSIBLE FOR HE WAS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN SHE WAS SO WONDERFUL IN THE WAY HE HAD TRIUMPHED OVER DISEASED THINKING
4438-48525-0030 SHE FOUND HERSELF HURRIEDLY SAYING IN A SMALL ANXIOUS VOICE OH YES VERY MUCH IS IT POSSIBLE SHE THOUGHT THAT I AM ABJECT YES SHE WAS EXTREMELY ABJECT
4438-48525-0031 SHE REFLECTED LYING AWAKE AT NIGHT CONSIDERING HER BEHAVIOUR DURING THE DAY LOVE HAD MADE HER SO LOVE DID MAKE ONE ABJECT FOR IT WAS FULL OF FEAR OF HURTING THE BELOVED THE ASSERTION OF THE SCRIPTURES
4438-48525-0032 THAT PERFECT LOVE CASTETH OUT FEAR ONLY SHOWED SEEING THAT HER LOVE FOR EVERARD WAS CERTAINLY PERFECT HOW LITTLE THE SCRIPTURES REALLY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT WELL IF SHE COULDN'T TELL HIM THE THINGS SHE WAS FEELING
4438-48525-0033 WHY COULDN'T SHE GET RID OF THE SORTS OF FEELINGS SHE COULDN'T TELL HIM AND JUST BE WHOLESOME WHY COULDN'T SHE BE AT LEAST AS WHOLESOME ABOUT GOING TO THAT HOUSE AS EVERARD IF ANYBODY WAS JUSTIFIED IN SHRINKING FROM THE WILLOWS IT WAS EVERARD NOT HERSELF
4438-48525-0034 SOMETIMES LUCY WOULD BE SURE THAT DEEP IN HIS CHARACTER THERE WAS A WONDERFUL STORE OF SIMPLE COURAGE HE DIDN'T SPEAK OF VERA'S DEATH NATURALLY HE DIDN'T WISH TO SPEAK OF THAT AWFUL AFTERNOON BUT HOW OFTEN HE MUST THINK OF IT
4438-48525-0035 HIDING HIS THOUGHTS EVEN FROM HER BEARING THEM ALTOGETHER ALONE SOMETIMES SHE WAS SURE OF THIS AND SOMETIMES SHE WAS EQUALLY SURE OF THE VERY OPPOSITE
4438-48525-0036 FROM THOSE TINY INDICATIONS THAT ONE SOMEHOW HAS NOTICED WITHOUT KNOWING THAT ONE HAS NOTICED AND THAT ARE SO FAR MORE REVEALING AND CONCLUSIVE THAN ANY WORDS SHE SOMETIMES WAS SURE HE REALLY HAD FORGOTTEN
4438-48525-0037 BUT THIS WAS TOO INCREDIBLE SHE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WHAT HAD PERHAPS HAPPENED SHE THOUGHT WAS THAT IN SELF DEFENCE FOR THE PRESERVATION OF HIS PEACE HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND NEVER TO THINK OF VERA
4438-48525-0038 ONLY BY BANISHING HER ALTOGETHER FROM HIS MIND WOULD HE BE SAFE YET THAT COULDN'T BE TRUE EITHER FOR SEVERAL TIMES ON THE HONEYMOON HE HAD BEGUN TALKING OF HER OF THINGS SHE HAD SAID OF THINGS SHE HAD LIKED
4438-48525-0039 IF IT WAS TO BE A SERIOUS TALK BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO HELP AND COMFORT HIM WHENEVER THE REMEMBRANCE OF HER DEATH AROSE TO TORMENT HIM BUT SHE COULDN'T BEAR TO HEAR HER MENTIONED CASUALLY
4438-48525-0040 IN A WAY SHE ADMIRED THIS CASUALNESS BECAUSE IT WAS A PROOF OF THE SUPREME WHOLESOMENESS EVERARD HAD ATTAINED TO BY SHEER COURAGEOUS DETERMINATION
