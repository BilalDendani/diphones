5796-49594-0000 IS IT POSSIBLE YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE POOL WHERE THE RED BERRIES GROW
5796-49594-0001 NEVER HEARD OF IT SAID THE SECOND NIGHTINGALE RATHER CROSSLY WELL EXPLAINED THE OTHER YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE BROOK FOR A DAY AND THREE QUARTERS AND THEN TAKE ALL THE PATHS TO THE LEFT UNTIL YOU COME TO THE POOL
5796-49594-0002 IT IS VERY UGLY AND MUDDY AND BUSHES WITH RED BERRIES ON THEM GROW AROUND IT WELL WHAT OF THAT SAID HER COMPANION
5796-49594-0003 DON'T YOU KNOW THAT EITHER EXCLAIMED HER FRIEND NO AH SAID THE FIRST NIGHTINGALE IT WAS VERY SAD SHE WENT OUT WITH HER FATHER THE KING WHO HAD A HUNTING PARTY
5796-49594-0004 AND SHE LOST HER WAY AND WANDERED ON UNTIL SHE CAME TO THE POOL HER POOR LITTLE FEET WERE SO HOT THAT SHE TOOK OFF HER GOLD EMBROIDERED SATIN SLIPPERS AND PUT THEM INTO THE WATER
5796-49594-0005 AND THE NEXT MINUTE THEY BEGAN TO GROW AND GROW AND TO GET LARGER AND LARGER UNTIL THEY WERE SO IMMENSE SHE COULD HARDLY WALK AT ALL AND THOUGH ALL THE PHYSICIANS IN THE KINGDOM HAVE TRIED TO MAKE THEM SMALLER
5796-49594-0006 NOTHING CAN BE DONE AND SHE IS PERFECTLY UNHAPPY WHAT A PITY SHE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS POOL SAID THE OTHER BIRD
5796-49594-0007 IT IS A PITY SAID HER COMPANION BUT YOU KNOW IF WE ONCE LET PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THIS WATER WILL DO WE SHOULD BE OVERRUN WITH CREATURES BATHING THEMSELVES BEAUTIFUL AND TRAMPLING OUR MOSS AND TEARING DOWN OUR ROSE TREES
5796-49594-0008 AND WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE ANY PEACE THAT IS TRUE AGREED THE OTHER VERY SOON AFTER THEY FLEW AWAY AND FAIRYFOOT WAS LEFT ALONE HE HAD BEEN SO EXCITED WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THAT HE HAD BEEN HARDLY ABLE TO LIE STILL
5796-49594-0009 HE WAS SO SORRY FOR THE PRINCESS GOLDENHAIR AND SO GLAD FOR HIMSELF
5796-49594-0010 HE COULD GO BACK TO HIS FATHER'S COURT AND HIS PARENTS WOULD PERHAPS BE FOND OF HIM BUT HE HAD SO GOOD A HEART THAT HE COULD NOT THINK OF BEING HAPPY HIMSELF AND LETTING OTHERS REMAIN UNHAPPY WHEN HE COULD HELP THEM
5796-49594-0011 SO THE FIRST THING WAS TO FIND THE PRINCESS GOLDENHAIR AND TELL HER ABOUT THE NIGHTINGALES FOUNTAIN BUT HOW WAS HE TO FIND HER THE NIGHTINGALES HAD NOT TOLD HIM HE WAS VERY MUCH TROUBLED INDEED HOW WAS HE TO FIND HER
5796-49594-0012 SUDDENLY QUITE SUDDENLY HE THOUGHT OF THE RING GAUZITA HAD GIVEN HIM WHEN SHE HAD GIVEN IT TO HIM SHE HAD MADE AN ODD REMARK WHEN YOU WISH TO GO ANYWHERE SHE HAD SAID HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND
5796-49594-0013 HE HAD THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF HER LITTLE JOKES BUT NOW IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT AT LEAST HE MIGHT TRY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN SO HE ROSE UP HELD THE RING IN HIS HAND CLOSED HIS EYES AND TURNED AROUND TWICE WHAT DID HAPPEN
5796-49594-0014 WAS THAT HE BEGAN TO WALK NOT VERY FAST BUT STILL PASSING ALONG AS IF HE WERE MOVING RAPIDLY HE DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE WAS GOING BUT HE GUESSED THAT THE RING DID
5796-49594-0015 HE WENT ON AND ON NOT GETTING IN THE LEAST TIRED UNTIL ABOUT DAYLIGHT HE FOUND HIMSELF UNDER A GREAT TREE AND ON THE GROUND BENEATH IT WAS SPREAD A DELIGHTFUL BREAKFAST WHICH HE KNEW WAS FOR HIM HE SAT DOWN AND ATE IT
5796-49594-0016 AND THEN GOT UP AGAIN AND WENT ON HIS WAY ONCE MORE
5796-49594-0017 HE KNEW IT WAS NOT STUMPINGHAME BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HAD NOT LARGE FEET BUT THEY ALL HAD SAD FACES AND ONCE OR TWICE WHEN HE PASSED GROUPS OF THEM WHO WERE TALKING
5796-49594-0018 HE HEARD THEM SPEAK OF THE PRINCESS GOLDENHAIR AS IF THEY WERE SORRY FOR HER AND COULD NOT ENJOY THEMSELVES WHILE SUCH A MISFORTUNE RESTED UPON HER SO SWEET AND LOVELY AND KIND A PRINCESS THEY SAID
5796-49594-0019 AND IT REALLY SEEMS AS IF SHE WOULD NEVER BE ANY BETTER THE SUN WAS JUST SETTING WHEN FAIRYFOOT CAME IN SIGHT OF THE PALACE IT WAS BUILT OF WHITE MARBLE AND HAD BEAUTIFUL PLEASURE GROUNDS ABOUT IT BUT SOMEHOW THERE SEEMED TO BE A SETTLED GLOOM IN THE AIR
5796-49594-0020 FAIRYFOOT HAD ENTERED THE GREAT PLEASURE GARDEN AND WAS WONDERING WHERE IT WOULD BE BEST TO GO FIRST WHEN HE SAW A LOVELY WHITE FAWN WITH A GOLDEN COLLAR ABOUT ITS NECK COME BOUNDING OVER THE FLOWER BEDS
5796-49594-0021 AND HE HEARD AT A LITTLE DISTANCE A SWEET VOICE SAYING SORROWFULLY COME BACK MY FAWN I CANNOT RUN AND PLAY WITH YOU AS I ONCE USED TO DO NOT LEAVE ME MY LITTLE FRIEND
5796-49594-0022 AND SOON FROM BEHIND THE TREES CAME A LINE OF BEAUTIFUL GIRLS WALKING TWO BY TWO ALL VERY SLOWLY AND AT THE HEAD OF THE LINE FIRST OF ALL CAME THE LOVELIEST PRINCESS IN THE WORLD DRESSED SOFTLY IN PURE WHITE
5796-49594-0023 THAT FAIRYFOOT LOVED HER IN A MOMENT AND HE KNELT ON ONE KNEE TAKING OFF HIS CAP AND BENDING HIS HEAD UNTIL HIS OWN GOLDEN HAIR ALMOST HID HIS FACE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS GOLDENHAIR BEAUTIFUL AND SWEET PRINCESS MAY I SPEAK TO YOU HE SAID
5796-49594-0024 IT SURPRISED HER TO SEE ONE SO POORLY DRESSED KNEELING BEFORE HER IN HER PALACE GARDENS AMONG THE BRILLIANT FLOWERS BUT SHE ALWAYS SPOKE SOFTLY TO EVERYONE WHAT IS THERE THAT I CAN DO FOR YOU MY FRIEND SHE SAID
5796-49594-0025 BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS ANSWERED FAIRYFOOT BLUSHING I HOPE VERY MUCH THAT I MAY BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU FOR ME SHE EXCLAIMED THANK YOU FRIEND
5796-49594-0026 INDEED I NEED A HELP I AM AFRAID NO ONE CAN EVER GIVE ME GRACIOUS AND FAIREST LADY SAID FAIRYFOOT IT IS THAT HELP I THINK NAY I AM SURE
5796-49594-0027 OH SAID THE SWEET PRINCESS YOU HAVE A KIND FACE AND MOST TRUE EYES AND WHEN I LOOK AT YOU I DO NOT KNOW WHY IT IS BUT I FEEL A LITTLE HAPPIER WHAT IS IT YOU WOULD SAY TO ME STILL KNEELING BEFORE HER
5796-49594-0028 STILL BENDING HIS HEAD MODESTLY AND STILL BLUSHING FAIRYFOOT TOLD HIS STORY HE TOLD HER OF HIS OWN SADNESS AND LONELINESS AND OF WHY HE WAS CONSIDERED SO TERRIBLE A DISGRACE TO HIS FAMILY HE TOLD HER ABOUT THE FOUNTAIN OF THE NIGHTINGALES
5796-49594-0029 AND WHILE HE TOLD IT HER BEAUTIFUL FACE CHANGED FROM RED TO WHITE AND HER HANDS CLOSELY CLASPED THEMSELVES TOGETHER OH SHE SAID WHEN HE HAD FINISHED
5796-49594-0030 AND HOW CAN I THANK YOU FOR BEING SO GOOD TO A POOR LITTLE PRINCESS WHOM YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ONLY LET ME SEE YOU HAPPY ONCE MORE MOST SWEET PRINCESS ANSWERED FAIRYFOOT AND THAT WILL BE ALL I DESIRE ONLY IF
5796-49594-0031 PERHAPS I MIGHT ONCE KISS YOUR HAND SHE HELD OUT HER HAND TO HIM WITH SO LOVELY A LOOK IN HER SOFT EYES THAT HE FELT HAPPIER THAN HE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE EVEN AT THE FAIRY DANCES
5796-49594-0032 SO NO ONE WAS TO GO BUT THE KING HIMSELF THE PRINCESS IN A COVERED CHAIR CARRIED BY TWO BEARERS THE LORD HIGH CHAMBERLAIN TWO MAIDS OF HONOUR AND FAIRYFOOT BEFORE MORNING THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY
5796-49594-0033 AND THE DAY AFTER THEY REACHED THE THICKET OF ROSES AND FAIRYFOOT PUSHED ASIDE THE BRANCHES AND LED THE WAY INTO THE DELL THE PRINCESS GOLDENHAIR SAT DOWN UPON THE EDGE OF THE POOL AND PUT HER FEET INTO IT IN TWO MINUTES THEY BEGAN TO LOOK SMALLER
5796-49594-0034 SHE BATHED THEM ONCE TWICE THREE TIMES AND AS THE NIGHTINGALES HAD SAID THEY BECAME SMALLER AND MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER
5796-49594-0035 AS FOR THE PRINCESS HERSELF SHE REALLY COULD NOT BE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN SHE HAD BEEN BUT THE LORD HIGH CHAMBERLAIN WHO HAD BEEN AN EXCEEDINGLY UGLY OLD GENTLEMAN AFTER WASHING HIS FACE BECAME SO YOUNG AND HANDSOME
5796-49594-0036 THAT THE FIRST MAID OF HONOUR IMMEDIATELY FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM WHEREUPON SHE WASHED HER FACE AND BECAME SO BEAUTIFUL THAT HE FELL IN LOVE WITH HER AND THEY WERE ENGAGED UPON THE SPOT THE PRINCESS COULD NOT FIND ANY WORDS TO TELL FAIRYFOOT HOW GRATEFUL SHE WAS AND HOW HAPPY
5796-49594-0037 SHE COULD ONLY LOOK AT HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH HER SOFT RADIANT EYES AND AGAIN AND AGAIN GIVE HIM HER HAND THAT HE MIGHT KISS IT SHE WAS SO SWEET AND GENTLE THAT FAIRYFOOT COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING HER AND WHEN THE KING BEGGED HIM TO RETURN TO THE PALACE WITH THEM
5796-49594-0038 AND LIVE THERE ALWAYS HE WAS MORE GLAD THAN I CAN TELL YOU TO BE NEAR THIS LOVELY PRINCESS TO BE HER FRIEND TO LOVE AND SERVE HER AND LOOK AT HER EVERY DAY WAS SUCH HAPPINESS THAT HE WANTED NOTHING MORE
5796-49594-0039 BUT FIRST HE WISHED TO VISIT HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND SISTERS AND BROTHERS IN STUMPINGHAME SO THE KING AND PRINCESS AND THEIR ATTENDANTS WENT WITH HIM TO THE POOL WHERE THE RED BERRIES GREW AND AFTER HE HAD BATHED HIS FEET IN THE WATER
5796-49594-0040 EVEN THE KING'S AND QUEEN'S SEEMING
5796-49594-0041 HE WAS RECEIVED WITH UNBOUNDED RAPTURE BY HIS PARENTS THE KING AND QUEEN FELT THAT TO HAVE A SON WITH FEET OF SUCH A SIZE WAS SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF INDEED THEY COULD NOT ADMIRE HIM SUFFICIENTLY ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS ILLUMINATED
5796-49594-0042 AND FEASTING CONTINUED THROUGHOUT HIS VISIT BUT THOUGH HE WAS GLAD TO BE NO MORE A DISGRACE TO HIS FAMILY IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT HE ENJOYED THE SIZE OF HIS FEET VERY MUCH ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT INDEED HE MUCH PREFERRED BEING PRINCE FAIRYFOOT
5796-49594-0043 AND HE WAS QUITE GLAD TO GO TO THE FOUNTAIN OF THE NIGHTINGALES AFTER HIS VISIT WAS AT AN END AND BATHE HIS FEET SMALL AGAIN AND TO RETURN TO THE PALACE OF THE PRINCESS GOLDENHAIR WITH THE SOFT AND TENDER EYES THERE EVERYONE LOVED HIM AND HE LOVED EVERYONE
5796-49594-0044 HE LOVED THE PRINCESS MORE DEARLY EVERY DAY AND OF COURSE AS SOON AS THEY WERE OLD ENOUGH THEY WERE MARRIED AND OF COURSE TOO THEY USED TO GO IN THE SUMMER TO THE FOREST AND DANCE IN THE MOONLIGHT WITH THE FAIRIES WHO ADORED THEM BOTH WHEN THEY WENT TO VISIT STUMPINGHAME
5796-49594-0045 THEY ALWAYS BATHED THEIR FEET IN THE POOL OF THE RED BERRIES AND WHEN THEY RETURNED THEY MADE THEM SMALL AGAIN IN THE FOUNTAIN OF THE NIGHTINGALES THEY WERE ALWAYS GREAT FRIENDS WITH ROBIN GOODFELLOW AND HE WAS ALWAYS VERY CONFIDENTIAL WITH THEM ABOUT GAUZITA
5796-49594-0046 WHO CONTINUED TO BE AS PRETTY AND SAUCY AS EVER SOME OF THESE DAYS HE USED TO SAY SEVERELY I'LL MARRY ANOTHER FAIRY AND SEE HOW SHE'LL LIKE THAT TO SEE SOMEONE ELSE BASKING IN MY SOCIETY I'LL GET EVEN WITH HER
