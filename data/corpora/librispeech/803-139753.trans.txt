803-139753-0000 HOW ONE CAME AS WAS FORETOLD TO THE CITY OF NEVER THE CHILD THAT PLAYED ABOUT THE TERRACES AND GARDENS IN SIGHT OF THE SURREY HILLS
803-139753-0001 NEVER KNEW THAT IT WAS HE THAT SHOULD COME TO THE ULTIMATE CITY NEVER KNEW THAT HE SHOULD SEE THE UNDER PITS
803-139753-0002 I THINK OF HIM NOW AS A CHILD WITH A LITTLE RED WATERING CAN GOING ABOUT THE GARDENS ON A SUMMER'S DAY THAT LIT THE WARM SOUTH COUNTRY HIS IMAGINATION DELIGHTED WITH ALL TALES OF QUITE LITTLE ADVENTURES
803-139753-0003 WALL ABOVE WALL AND MOUNTAIN ABOVE MOUNTAIN STANDS AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD AND IN PERPETUAL TWILIGHT ALONE WITH THE MOON AND THE SUN HOLDS UP THE INCONCEIVABLE CITY OF NEVER TO TREAD ITS STREETS HE WAS DESTINED
803-139753-0004 PROPHECY KNEW IT HE HAD THE MAGIC HALTER AND A WORN OLD ROPE IT WAS AN OLD WAYFARING WOMAN HAD GIVEN IT TO HIM IT HAD THE POWER TO HOLD ANY ANIMAL WHOSE RACE HAD NEVER KNOWN CAPTIVITY SUCH AS THE UNICORN
803-139753-0005 THAT MARVEL OF THE NATIONS NOT WHEN IT IS NIGHT IN THE WORLD AND WE CAN SEE NO FURTHER THAN THE STARS NOT WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING WHERE WE DWELL DAZZLING OUR EYES BUT WHEN THE SUN HAS SET ON SOME STORMY DAYS
803-139753-0006 THAT OVERPEER THE EDGES OF THE WORLD AND SEEM TO DANCE WITH DIGNITY AND CALM IN THAT GENTLE LIGHT OF EVENING THAT IS WONDER'S NATIVE HAUNT THEN DOES THE CITY OF NEVER UNVISITED AND AFAR LOOK LONG AT HER SISTER THE WORLD
803-139753-0007 IT HAD BEEN PROPHECIED THAT HE SHOULD COME THERE THEY KNEW IT WHEN THE PEBBLES WERE BEING MADE AND BEFORE THE ISLES OF CORAL WERE GIVEN UNTO THE SEA AND THUS THE PROPHECY CAME UNTO FULFILMENT AND PASSED INTO HISTORY
803-139753-0008 AND SO AT LENGTH TO OBLIVION OUT OF WHICH I DRAG IT AS IT GOES FLOATING BY INTO WHICH I SHALL ONE DAY TUMBLE THE HIPPOGRIFFS DANCE BEFORE DAWN IN THE UPPER AIR LONG BEFORE SUNRISE FLASHES UPON OUR LAWNS
803-139753-0009 THEY GO TO GLITTER IN LIGHT THAT HAS NOT YET COME TO THE WORLD AND AS THE DAWN WORKS UP FROM THE RAGGED HILLS AND THE STARS FEEL IT THEY GO SLANTING EARTHWARDS TILL SUNLIGHT TOUCHES THE TOPS OF THE TALLEST TREES AND THE HIPPOGRIFFS ALIGHT
803-139753-0010 WITH A RATTLE OF QUILLS AND FOLD THEIR WINGS AND GALLOP AND GAMBOL AWAY TILL THEY COME TO SOME PROSPEROUS WEALTHY DETESTABLE TOWN AND THEY LEAP AT ONCE FROM THE FIELDS AND SOAR AWAY FROM THE SIGHT OF IT PURSUED BY THE HORRIBLE SMOKE OF IT
803-139753-0011 UNTIL THEY COME AGAIN TO THE PURE BLUE AIR HE WHOM PROPHECY HAD NAMED FROM OF OLD TO COME TO THE CITY OF NEVER WENT DOWN ONE MIDNIGHT WITH HIS MAGIC HALTER TO A LAKE SIDE WHERE THE HIPPOGRIFFS ALIGHTED AT DAWN
803-139753-0012 FOR THE TURF WAS SOFT THERE AND THEY COULD GALLOP FAR BEFORE THEY CAME TO A TOWN AND THERE HE WAITED HIDDEN NEAR THEIR HOOFMARKS AND THE STARS PALED A LITTLE AND GREW INDISTINCT BUT THERE WAS NO OTHER SIGN AS YET OF THE DAWN
803-139753-0013 WHEN THERE APPEARED FAR UP IN THE DEEPS OF THE NIGHT TWO LITTLE SAFFRON SPECKS THEN FOUR AND FIVE IT WAS THE HIPPOGRIFFS DANCING AND TWIRLING AROUND IN THE SUN ANOTHER FLOCK JOINED THEM THERE WERE TWELVE OF THEM NOW
803-139753-0014 THEY DESCENDED IN WIDE CURVES SLOWLY TREES DOWN ON EARTH REVEALED AGAINST THE SKY JET BLACK EACH DELICATE TWIG A STAR DISAPPEARED FROM A CLUSTER NOW ANOTHER
803-139753-0015 AND DAWN CAME ON LIKE MUSIC LIKE A NEW SONG DUCKS SHOT BY TO THE LAKE FROM STILL DARK FIELDS OF CORN FAR VOICES UTTERED A COLOUR GREW UPON WATER AND STILL THE HIPPOGRIFFS GLORIED IN THE LIGHT
803-139753-0016 REVELLING UP IN THE SKY BUT WHEN PIGEONS STIRRED ON THE BRANCHES AND THE FIRST SMALL BIRD WAS ABROAD AND LITTLE COOTS FROM THE RUSHES VENTURED TO PEER ABOUT
803-139753-0017 AS A WOUNDED BEAST GOES HOME BUT WHEN THEY CAME TO THE HEIGHTS THAT VENTUROUS RIDER SAW HUGE AND FAIR TO THE LEFT OF HIM THE DESTINED CITY OF NEVER AND HE BEHELD THE TOWERS OF LEL AND LEK
803-139753-0018 AT EVENING UPON THE WORLD WHILE OTHERS HINT THAT KNOWLEDGE OF THESE MIGHT UNDO OUR CIVILIZATION THERE WATCHED HIM CEASELESSLY FROM THE UNDER PITS THOSE EYES WHOSE DUTY IT IS FROM FURTHER WITHIN AND DEEPER
803-139753-0019 THE SENTINELS ON THE BULWARKS BEHELD THAT STREAM OF BATS AND LIFTED UP THEIR SPEARS AS IT WERE FOR WAR NEVERTHELESS WHEN THEY PERCEIVED THAT THAT WAR FOR WHICH THEY WATCHED WAS NOT NOW COME UPON THEM
803-139753-0020 THEY LOWERED THEIR SPEARS AND SUFFERED HIM TO ENTER AND HE PASSED WHIRRING THROUGH THE EARTHWARD GATEWAY EVEN SO HE CAME AS FORETOLD TO THE CITY OF NEVER PERCHED UPON TOLDENARBA
803-139753-0021 AND SAW LATE TWILIGHT ON THOSE PINNACLES THAT KNOW NO OTHER LIGHT ALL THE DOMES WERE OF COPPER BUT THE SPIRES ON THEIR SUMMITS WERE GOLD LITTLE STEPS OF ONYX RAN ALL THIS WAY AND THAT
803-139753-0022 WITH COBBLED AGATES WERE ITS STREETS A GLORY THROUGH SMALL SQUARE PANES OF ROSE QUARTZ THE CITIZENS LOOKED FROM THEIR HOUSES TO THEM AS THEY LOOKED ABROAD THE WORLD FAR OFF SEEMED HAPPY
803-139753-0023 CLAD THOUGH THAT CITY WAS IN ONE ROBE ALWAYS IN TWILIGHT YET WAS ITS BEAUTY WORTHY OF EVEN SO LOVELY A WONDER CITY AND TWILIGHT WERE BOTH PEERLESS BUT FOR EACH OTHER
803-139753-0024 THAT NONE CAN SAY OF THEM WHERE THEIR BOUNDARY IS AND WHICH THE ETERNAL TWILIGHT
803-139753-0025 AND PASSING AWAY MOURNING CATASTROPHES IN OTHER WORLDS AND THEY BUILT TEMPLES SOMETIMES TO RUINED STARS THAT HAD FALLEN FLAMING DOWN FROM THE MILKY WAY GIVING THEM WORSHIP STILL WHEN BY US LONG SINCE FORGOTTEN
803-139753-0026 OTHER TEMPLES THEY HAVE WHO KNOWS TO WHAT DIVINITIES AND HE THAT WAS DESTINED ALONE OF MEN TO COME TO THE CITY OF NEVER WAS WELL CONTENT TO BEHOLD IT AS HE TROTTED DOWN ITS AGATE STREET
803-139753-0027 WITH THE WINGS OF HIS HIPPOGRIFF FURLED SEEING AT EITHER SIDE OF HIM MARVEL ON MARVEL OF WHICH EVEN CHINA IS IGNORANT THEN AS HE NEARED THE CITY'S FURTHER RAMPART BY WHICH NO INHABITANT STIRRED
803-139753-0028 AND LOOKED IN A DIRECTION TO WHICH NO HOUSES FACED WITH ANY ROSE PINK WINDOWS HE SUDDENLY SAW FAR OFF DWARFING THE MOUNTAINS AN EVEN GREATER CITY WHETHER THAT CITY WAS BUILT UPON THE TWILIGHT
803-139753-0029 OR WHETHER IT ROSE FROM THE COASTS OF SOME OTHER WORLD HE DID NOT KNOW HE SAW IT DOMINATE THE CITY OF NEVER AND STROVE TO REACH IT
803-139753-0030 THE HIPPOGRIFF SHIED FRANTICALLY AND NEITHER THE MAGIC HALTER NOR ANYTHING THAT HE DID COULD MAKE THE MONSTER FACE IT AT LAST FROM THE CITY OF NEVER'S LONELY OUTSKIRTS WHERE NO INHABITANTS WALKED
803-139753-0031 THE RIDER TURNED SLOWLY EARTHWARD HE KNEW NOW WHY ALL THE WINDOWS FACED THIS WAY THE DENIZENS OF THE TWILIGHT GAZED AT THE WORLD AND NOT AT A GREATER THAN THEM THEN FROM THE LAST STEP OF THE EARTHWARD STAIRWAY
803-139753-0032 LIKE LEAD PAST THE UNDER PITS AND DOWN THE GLITTERING FACE OF TOLDENARBA DOWN FROM THE OVERSHADOWED GLORIES OF THE GOLD TIPPED CITY OF NEVER AND OUT OF PERPETUAL TWILIGHT SWOOPED THE MAN ON HIS WINGED MONSTER
803-139753-0033 THE WIND THAT SLEPT AT THE TIME LEAPED UP LIKE A DOG AT THEIR ONRUSH IT UTTERED A CRY AND RAN PAST THEM DOWN ON THE WORLD IT WAS MORNING NIGHT WAS ROAMING AWAY WITH HIS CLOAK TRAILED BEHIND HIM
803-139753-0034 THE ORB WAS GREY BUT IT GLITTERED LIGHTS BLINKED SURPRISINGLY IN EARLY WINDOWS FORTH OVER WET DIM FIELDS WENT COWS FROM THEIR HOUSES EVEN IN THIS HOUR TOUCHED THE FIELDS AGAIN THE FEET OF THE HIPPOGRIFF
803-139753-0035 GOING BACK TO SOME AIRY DANCING PLACE OF HIS PEOPLE AND HE THAT SURMOUNTED GLITTERING TOLDENARBA AND CAME ALONE OF MEN TO THE CITY OF NEVER HAS HIS NAME AND HIS FAME AMONG NATIONS
803-139753-0036 BUT HE AND THE PEOPLE OF THAT TWILIT CITY WELL KNOW TWO THINGS UNGUESSED BY OTHER MEN
