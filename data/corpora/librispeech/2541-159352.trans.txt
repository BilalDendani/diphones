2541-159352-0000 MOTHER ROUNDABOUT'S DAUGHTER ONCE ON A TIME THERE WAS A GOODY WHO HAD A SON AND HE WAS SO LAZY AND SLOW HE WOULD NEVER TURN HIS HAND TO ANYTHING THAT WAS USEFUL BUT SINGING AND DANCING HE WAS VERY FOND OF
2541-159352-0001 AND MORE AND MORE WAS SPENT IN CLOTHING AS HE GREW BIGGER AND BIGGER AND IT WAS SOON WORN OUT I SHOULD THINK FOR HE DANCED AND SPRANG ABOUT BOTH IN WOOD AND FIELD AT LAST THE GOODY THOUGHT IT TOO BAD
2541-159352-0002 SO SHE TOLD THE LAD THAT NOW HE MUST BEGIN TO TURN HIS HAND TO WORK AND LIVE STEADILY OR ELSE THERE WAS NOTHING BEFORE BOTH OF THEM BUT STARVING TO DEATH BUT THAT THE LAD HAD NO MIND TO DO
2541-159352-0003 HE WOULD BE ABLE TO LIVE WELL AND SOFTLY ALL HIS DAYS AND SING AND DANCE AND NEVER DO ONE STROKE OF WORK WHEN HIS MOTHER HEARD THIS SHE TOO THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A VERY FINE THING AND SO SHE FITTED OUT THE LAD
2541-159352-0004 AS WELL AS SHE COULD THAT HE MIGHT LOOK TIDY WHEN HE REACHED MOTHER ROUNDABOUT'S HOUSE AND SO HE SET OFF ON HIS WAY NOW WHEN HE GOT OUT OF DOORS THE SUN SHONE WARM AND BRIGHT BUT IT HAD RAINED THE NIGHT BEFORE SO THAT THE WAYS WERE SOFT AND MIRY
2541-159352-0005 THE LAD TOOK A SHORT CUT TO MOTHER ROUNDABOUT'S AND HE SANG AND JUMPED AS WAS EVER HIS WONT BUT JUST AS HE SPRANG AND LEAPED HE CAME TO A BOG HOLE AND OVER IT LAY A LITTLE BRIDGE
2541-159352-0006 AND FROM THE BRIDGE HE HAD TO MAKE A SPRING ACROSS A HOLE ON TO A TUFT OF GRASS THAT HE MIGHT NOT DIRTY HIS SHOES BUT PLUMP IT WENT ALL AT ONCE AND JUST AS HE PUT HIS FOOT ON THE TUFT IT GAVE WAY UNDER HIM
2541-159352-0007 WITH A BUNCH OF KEYS AT THE TIP OF HER TAIL WHAT YOU HERE MY BOY SAID THE RAT THANK YOU KINDLY FOR COMING TO ME I HAVE WAITED LONG FOR YOU YOU COME OF COURSE TO WOO ME AND YOU ARE EAGER AT IT I CAN VERY WELL SEE

2541-159352-0014 AS HE WAS WONT BUT EVEN THOUGH HE THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE RAT HOLE

2541-159352-0021 BUT JUST AS HE LEAPED AND JUMPED HE GOT UPON THE BRIDGE OVER THE MOOR AGAIN AND FROM IT HE HAD TO JUMP OVER A BOG HOLE ON TO A TURF THAT HE MIGHT NOT SOIL HIS SHOES BUT PLUMP IT WENT AND DOWN IT WENT UNDER HIM
2541-159352-0022 AND THERE WAS NO STOPPING TILL HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A NASTY DEEP DARK HOLE AT FIRST HE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT WHEN HE HAD BEEN THERE A WHILE HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A RAT WITH A BUNCH OF KEYS AT THE TIP OF HER TAIL WHO CAME WIGGLE WAGGLE UP TO HIM
