2262-141716-0000 AND PASSING BY A VERY STRONG CASTLE SEVERAL ARM'D ARABIANS RUSH'D OUT UPON HIM AND SURROUNDING HIM CRIED OUT
2262-141716-0001 BUT AS FOR YOUR PERSON THAT IS ENTIRELY AT OUR SOVEREIGN'S DISPOSAL ZADIG INSTEAD OF MAKING ANY REPLY DREW HIS SWORD AND AS HIS ATTENDANT WAS A VERY COURAGIOUS FELLOW HE DREW LIKEWISE
2262-141716-0002 THOSE WHO LAID HOLD ON THEM FIRST FELL A SACRIFICE TO THEIR FURY THEIR NUMBERS REDOUBLED YET STILL BOTH DAUNTLESS DETERMIN'D TO CONQUER OR TO DIE WHEN TWO MEN DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST A WHOLE GANG
2262-141716-0003 THE CONTEST DOUBTLESS CANNOT LAST LONG THE MASTER OF THE CASTLE ONE ARBOGAD BY NAME HAVING BEEN AN EYE WITNESS FROM HIS WINDOW OF THE INTREPIDITY AND SURPRISING EXPLOITS OF ZADIG TOOK A FANCY TO HIM
2262-141716-0004 DELIVER'D THE TWO TRAVELLERS OUT OF THEIR HANDS WHATEVER GOODS OR CHATTELS SAID HE COME UPON MY TERRITORIES ARE MY EFFECTS AND WHATEVER I FIND LIKEWISE THAT IS VALUABLE UPON THE PREMISES OF OTHERS IS MY FREE BOOTY
2262-141716-0005 BUT AS YOU APPEAR SIR TO ME TO BE A GENTLEMAN OF UNCOMMON COURAGE YOU SHALL PROVE AN EXCEPTION TO MY GENERAL RULE UPON THIS HE INVITED ZADIG INTO HIS MAGNIFICENT MANSION
2262-141716-0006 GIVING HIS INFERIOR OFFICERS STRICT ORDERS TO USE HIM WITH ALL DUE RESPECT AND AT NIGHT ARBOGAD WAS DESIROUS OF SUPPING WITH ZADIG
2262-141716-0007 THAT ARE CALL'D FREE BOOTERS BUT A MAN WHO NOW AND THEN DID GOOD ACTIONS AMONGST A THOUSAND BAD ONES HE PLUNDER'D WITHOUT MERCY BUT WAS LIBERAL IN HIS BENEFACTIONS WHEN IN ACTION INTREPID BUT IN TRAFFICK EASY ENOUGH A PERFECT EPICURE

2262-141716-0010 FROM MY YOUTH UPWARDS REPLIED HIS HOST I WAS ONLY A VALET AT FIRST TO AN ARABIAN WHO INDEED WAS COURTEOUS ENOUGH BUT SERVITUDE WAS A STATE OF LIFE I COULD NOT BROOK IT MADE ME STARK MAD TO SEE
2262-141716-0011 IN A WIDE WORLD WHICH OUGHT TO BE DIVIDED FAIRLY BETWEEN MANKIND THAT FATE HAD RESERV'D FOR ME SO SCANTY A PORTION I COMMUNICATED MY GRIEVANCE TO AN OLD SAGE ARABIAN SON SAID HE NEVER DESPAIR
2262-141716-0012 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A GRAIN OF SAND THAT BEMOAN'D ITSELF AS BEING NOTHING MORE THAN A WORTHLESS ATOM OF THE DESERTS
2262-141716-0013 IT BECAME THAT INESTIMABLE DIAMOND
2262-141716-0014 THE ATOM HE MENTION'D BUT WAS DETERMIN'D IF POSSIBLE TO BECOME THE DIAMOND AT MY FIRST SETTING OUT I STOLE TWO HORSES
2262-141716-0015 STOPP'D THE SMALL CARAVANS THUS I GRADUALLY LESSEN'D THE WIDE DISPROPORTION
2262-141716-0016 I ENJOY'D NOT ONLY MY FULL SHARE OF THE GOOD THINGS OF THIS LIFE BUT ENJOY'D THEM WITH USURY I WAS LOOK'D UPON AS A MAN OF CONSEQUENCE AND I PROCUR'D THIS CASTLE BY MY MILITARY ATCHIEVEMENTS THE SATRAP OF SYRIA
2262-141716-0017 HAD THOUGHTS OF DISPOSSESSING ME BUT I WAS THEN TOO RICH TO BE ANY WAYS AFRAID OF HIM I GAVE THE SATRAP A CERTAIN SUM OF MONEY UPON CONDITION THAT I KEPT QUIET POSSESSION OF MY CASTLE AND MOREOVER
2262-141716-0018 I AGGRANDIZ'D MY DOMAINS FOR HE CONSTITUTED ME AT THE SAME TIME TREASURER OF THE IMPORTS THAT ARABIA PETRAEA PAID TO THE KING OF KINGS I EXECUTED MY TRUST IN EVERY RESPECT AS I OUGHT IN THE CAPACITY OF A COLLECTOR
2262-141716-0019 NEVER INTENDED TO BALANCE MY ACCOUNTS THE GRAND DESTERHAM OF BABYLON SENT HITHER IN THE NAME OF THE KING MOABDAR A PETTY SATRAP WITH A COMMISSION TO STRANGLE ME
2262-141716-0020 HE AND HIS ATTENDANTS ARRIV'D HERE WITH HIS ROYAL WARRANT
2262-141716-0021 ACCORDINGLY ORDER'D HIS WHOLE RETINUE
2262-141716-0022 TO BE STRANGLED BEFORE HIS FACE AFTER THE SAME MANNER AS WAS INTENDED FOR MY EXECUTION AFTER THIS
2262-141716-0023 HE ANSWER'D THAT HE PRESUM'D HIS PREMIUM HAD HE SUCCEEDED MIGHT HAVE AMOUNTED TO ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PIECES OF GOLD
2262-141716-0024 OFFICER UNDER ME I MADE HIM ACCORDINGLY DEPUTY FREE BOOTER HE IS AT THIS VERY DAY NOT ONLY THE BEST OFFICER BUT THE RICHEST I HAVE IN ALL MY COURT IF MY WORD MAY BE CREDITED I'LL RAISE YOUR FORTUNE AS I HAVE DONE HIS
2262-141716-0025 NEVER WAS TRADE BRISKER IN OUR WAY FOR MOABDAR IS KNOCK'D ON THE HEAD AND ALL BABYLON IN THE UTMOST CONFUSION MOABDAR KILL'D SAID YOU CRY'D ZADIG AND PRAY SIR WHAT IS BECOME OF HIS ROYAL CONSORT
2262-141716-0026 I KNOW NOTHING AT ALL OF THAT AFFAIR REPLIED ARBOGAD ALL THAT I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT MOABDAR BECAME A PERFECT MADMAN AND HAD HIS BRAINS BEAT OUT
2262-141716-0027 THAT ALL THE PEOPLE IN BABYLON ARE CUTTING ONE ANOTHER'S THROATS AND THAT THE WHOLE EMPIRE IS LAID WASTE THAT THERE IS STILL AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MAKING SEVERAL BOLD PUSHES AND LET ME TELL YOU SIR I HAVE DONE MY PART
2262-141716-0028 AND MADE THE MOST ON'T BUT THE QUEEN SIR SAID ZADIG PRAY FAVOUR ME SO FAR AS TO INFORM ME IF YOU KNOW ANY THING OF THE QUEEN
2262-141716-0029 OF A CERTAIN PRINCE OF HYRCANIA TIS VERY POSSIBLE
2262-141716-0030 IF SHE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO ESCAPE THE RESENTMENT OF THOSE POPULAR TUMULTS BUT MY HEAD SIR IS BETTER TURN'D FOR THE HIGHWAY THAN FOR NEWS I HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL LADIES PRISONERS
2262-141716-0031 I KEEP NONE OF THEM FOR MY PART AND AS TO SUCH AS ARE HANDSOMER THAN ORDINARY I MAKE THE BEST MARKET I CAN OF THEM WITHOUT ENQUIRING WHO THEY ARE THEIR QUALITY OR TITLES WILL FETCH NO PRICE AT ALL
2262-141716-0032 A QUEEN IF SHE BE HOMELY IS WORTH NOTHING TIS PROBABLE SIR I HAVE DISPOS'D OF THE LADY MYSELF AND TIS POSSIBLE LIKEWISE SHE MAY BE DEAD
2262-141716-0033 AFTER THIS DECLARATION HE DRANK SO HARD
2262-141716-0034 THAT ZADIG WAS NOT ONE WHIT THE WISER UPON WHICH HE WAS STRUCK DUMB CONFOUNDED AND STOOD AS MOTIONLESS AS A STATUE ARBOGAD IN THE MEAN WHILE SWILL'D DOWN WHOLE BUMPERS TOLD A HUNDRED MERRY TALES
2262-141716-0035 AND SWORE A THOUSAND TIMES OVER THAT HE WAS THE HAPPIEST CREATURE UPON GOD'S EARTH PERSUADING ZADIG TO BE AS MERRY AND THOUGHTLESS AS HIMSELF AT LAST BEING GRADUALLY OVERCOME BY THE FUMES OF HIS LIQUOR
2262-141716-0036 HE FELL FAST ASLEEP ZADIG SPENT THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT IN DEEP CONTEMPLATION AND IN ALL THE UNEASINESS OF MIND IMAGINABLE WHAT SAID HE THE KING FIRST BECAME CRAZY AND THEN WAS MURDER'D
2262-141716-0037 I THINK I HAVE JUST GROUNDS FOR COMPLAINT THE WHOLE EMPIRE IS IN CONFUSION AND TORN TO PIECES AND THIS FREE BOOTER IS AS HAPPY AS A KING O FORTUNE O FATE A HIGHWAYMAN AS HAPPY AS A MONARCH
2262-141716-0038 AN IGNOMINIOUS DEATH OR PERHAPS IS IN A STATE OF LIFE A THOUSAND TIMES WORSE THAN DEATH ITSELF O ASTARTE ASTARTE
2262-141716-0039 AND ASK'D EVERY ONE HE SAW IF THEY KNEW ANY THING OF HER BUT THE WHOLE GANG WERE TOO INTENT UPON OTHER MATTERS TO RETURN HIM ANY ANSWER BY VIRTUE OF THEIR NIGHT'S EXCURSIONS THEY HAD BROUGHT IN SOME FRESH BOOTY AND WERE BUSY IN DIVIDING THE SPOIL
2262-141716-0040 ALL THE FAVOUR HE COULD PROCURE IN THEIR HURRY AND TUMULT WAS TO GO AWAY WITHOUT THE LEAST EXAMINATION HE TOOK THE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR REMISSNESS AND MOV'D OFF THE PREMISES
2262-141716-0041 BUT MORE OVERWHELM'D WITH GRIEF AND DEEP REFLECTION THAN EVER ZADIG IN HIS MARCH WAS VERY RESTLESS AND UNEASY HIS THOUGHTS WERE FOREVER ROLLING ON THE UNFORTUNATE ASTARTE THE KING OF BABYLON HIS BOSOM FRIEND CADOR
2262-141716-0042 THE HAPPY FREE BOOTER ARBOGAD THE FAIR COQUET THAT WAS TAKEN PRISONER ON THE CONFINES OF EGYPT BY THE BABYLONISH COURIER
