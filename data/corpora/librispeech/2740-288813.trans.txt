2740-288813-0000 AFTER A TIME PETE REMEMBERED THAT HE WAS SITTING IN THE DARK AND HE GOT UP TO LIGHT A CANDLE LOOKING FOR CANDLESTICK AND MATCHES HE WENT FROM TABLE TO DRESSER FROM DRESSER TO TABLE AND FROM TABLE BACK TO DRESSER DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN
2740-288813-0001 AND NOT PERCEIVING THAT HE WAS GOING ROUND AND ROUND WHEN AT LENGTH THE CANDLE WAS LIGHTED HE TOOK IT IN HIS HAND AND WENT INTO THE PARLOUR LIKE A SLEEPWALKER HE SET IT ON THE MANTELPIECE AND SAT DOWN ON THE STOOL
2740-288813-0002 IN HIS BLURRED VISION CONFUSED FORMS FLOATED ABOUT HIM AH MY TOOLS HE THOUGHT AND PICKED UP THE MALLET AND TWO OF THE CHISELS HE WAS SITTING WITH THESE IN HIS HANDS WHEN HIS EYES FELL ON THE OTHER CANDLESTICK THE ONE IN WHICH THE CANDLE HAD GONE OUT
2740-288813-0003 WHEN HE CAME BACK WITH ANOTHER LIGHTED CANDLE HE PERCEIVED THAT THERE WERE TWO I'M GOING STUPID HE THOUGHT AND HE BLEW OUT THE FIRST ONE A MOMENT AFTERWARDS HE FORGOT THAT HE HAD DONE SO AND SEEING THE SECOND STILL BURNING HE BLEW THAT OUT ALSO
2740-288813-0004 SO DULL WERE HIS SENSES THAT HE DID NOT REALISE THAT ANYTHING WAS AMISS HIS EYES WERE SEEING OBJECTS EVERYWHERE ABOUT THEY WERE GROWING TO AWFUL SIZE AND THREATENING HIM
2740-288813-0005 HIS EARS WERE HEARING NOISES THEY WERE MAKING A FEARFUL TUMULT INSIDE HIS HEAD THE ROOM WAS NOT ENTIRELY DARK A SHAFT OF BLEARED MOONLIGHT CAME AND WENT AT INTERVALS
2740-288813-0006 THE MOON WAS SCUDDING THROUGH AN ANGRY SKY SOMETIMES APPEARING SOMETIMES DISAPPEARING PETE RETURNED TO THE STOOL AND THEN HE WAS IN THE LIGHT BUT THE NAMELESS STONE LEANING AGAINST THE WALL WAS IN THE SHADE
2740-288813-0007 HE TOOK UP THE MALLET AND CHISELS AGAIN INTENDING TO WORK HUSH HE SAID AS HE BEGAN THE CLAMOUR IN HIS BRAIN WAS SO LOUD THAT HE THOUGHT SOME ONE WAS MAKING A NOISE IN THE HOUSE THIS TASK WAS SACRED HE ALWAYS WORKED AT IT IN SILENCE
2740-288813-0008 PAT PUT PAT PUT HOW LONG HE WORKED HE NEVER KNEW THERE ARE MOMENTS WHICH ARE NOT TO BE MEASURED AS TIME IN THE UNCERTAIN HANDLING OF THE CHISEL AND THE IRREGULAR BEAT OF THE MALLET SOMETHING GAVE WAY THERE WAS A HARSH SOUND LIKE A GROAN
2740-288813-0009 A CRACK LIKE A FLASH OF FORKED LIGHTNING HAD SHOT ACROSS THE FACE OF THE STONE HE HAD SPLIT IT IN HALF ITS GREAT PIECES FELL TO THE FLOOR ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT THE STONE HAD BEEN USELESS IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW HE THOUGHT
2740-288813-0010 NOTHING MATTERED WITH THE MALLET HANGING FROM HIS HAND HE CONTINUED TO SIT IN THE DRIFTING MOONLIGHT FEELING AS IF EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD HAD BEEN SHIVERED TO ATOMS HIS TWO IDOLS HAD BEEN SCATTERED AT ONE BLOW HIS WIFE AND HIS FRIEND
2740-288813-0011 THE GOLDEN THREADS THAT HAD BOUND HIM TO LIFE WERE BROKEN WHEN POVERTY HAD COME HE HAD MET IT WITHOUT REPINING WHEN DEATH HAD SEEMED TO COME HE HAD BORNE UP AGAINST IT BRAVELY BUT WIFELESS FRIENDLESS DECEIVED WHERE HE HAD LOVED
2740-288813-0012 BETRAYED WHERE HE HAD WORSHIPPED HE WAS BANKRUPT HE WAS BROKEN AND A BOUNDLESS DESPAIR TOOK HOLD OF HIM WHEN HOPE IS ENTIRELY GONE ANGUISH WILL SOMETIMES TURN A MAN INTO A MONSTER THERE WAS A FRETFUL CRY FROM THE CRADLE
2740-288813-0013 AND STILL IN THE STUPOR OF HIS DESPAIR HE WENT OUT TO ROCK IT THE FIRE WHICH HAD ONLY SLID AND SMOULDERED WAS NOW STRUGGLING INTO FLAME AND THE CHILD LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH PHILIP'S EYES A KNIFE SEEMED TO ENTER HIS HEART AT THAT MOMENT
2740-288813-0014 HE WAS MORE DESOLATE THAN HE HAD THOUGHT HUSH MY CHILD HUSH HE SAID WITHOUT THINKING HIS CHILD HE HAD NONE THAT SOLACE WAS GONE ANGER CAME TO SAVE HIS REASON
2740-288813-0015 NOT TO HAVE FELT ANGER HE MUST HAVE BEEN LESS THAN A MAN OR MORE HE REMEMBERED WHAT THE CHILD HAD BEEN TO HIM HE REMEMBERED WHAT IT WAS WHEN IT CAME AND AGAIN WHEN HE THOUGHT ITS MOTHER WAS DEAD HE REMEMBERED WHAT IT WAS WHEN DEATH FROWNED ON IT
2740-288813-0016 AND WHAT IT HAD BEEN SINCE DEATH PASSED IT BY FLESH OF HIS FLESH BLOOD OF HIS BLOOD BONE OF HIS BONE HEART OF HIS HEART NOT HIS MERELY BUT HIMSELF
2740-288813-0017 A LIE A MOCKERY A DELUSION A DECEPTION SHE HAS PRACTISED IT OH SHE HAD HIDDEN HER SECRET SHE HAD THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE BUT THE CHILD ITSELF HAD BETRAYED IT THE SECRET HAD SPOKEN FROM THE CHILD'S OWN FACE

2740-288813-0020 BY A QUICK REVOLT OF TENDERNESS HE RECALLED KATE AS HE HAD JUST SEEN HER CROUCHING AT THE BACK OF THE CRADLE LIKE A HUNTED HARE WITH UPLIFTED PAWS UTTERING ITS LAST PITIFUL CRY HE REMEMBERED HER ALTERED FACE SO PALE EVEN IN THE FIRELIGHT
2740-288813-0021 SO THIN SO WORN AND HIS ANGER BEGAN TO SMOKE AGAINST PHILIP THE FLOWER THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD TO WEAR ON HIS BREAST PHILIP HAD BURIED IN THE DARK CURSE HIM CURSE HIM SHE HAD GIVEN UP ALL FOR THAT MAN

2740-288813-0024 TWO STREAMS RUNNING INTO THEM AND TAKING HEAVEN INTO THEIR BOSOM BUT PHILIP HAD KEPT HIM APART HAD BANKED HIM OFF AND YET DRAINED HIM TO THE DREGS HE HAD UNCOVERED HIS NAKEDNESS THE NAKEDNESS OF HIS SOUL ITSELF
2740-288813-0025 BIT BY BIT PETE PIECED TOGETHER THE HISTORY OF THE PAST MONTHS HE REMEMBERED THE NIGHT OF KATE'S DISAPPEARANCE WHEN HE HAD GONE TO BALLURE AND SHOUTED UP AT THE LIGHTED WINDOW
2740-288813-0026 THINKING TO HIDE HER FAULT AT THAT MOMENT PHILIP HAD KNOWN ALL WHERE SHE WAS FOR IT WAS WHERE HE HAD SENT HER WHY SHE WAS GONE AND THAT SHE WAS GONE FOR EVER CURSE HIM CURSE HIM PETE RECALLED THE LETTERS
2740-288813-0027 THE FIRST ONE THAT HE HAD PUT INTO PHILIP'S HAND THE SECOND THAT HE HAD READ TO HIM THE THIRD THAT PHILIP HAD WRITTEN TO HIS DICTATION THE LITTLE FORGERIES TO KEEP HER POOR NAME SWEET THE LITTLE INVENTIONS TO MAKE HIS STORY PLAUSIBLE THE LITTLE LIES OF LOVE
2740-288813-0028 THE LITTLE JESTS OF A BREAKING HEART AND THEN THE MESSAGES THE PRESENTS TO THE CHILD THE REFERENCE TO THE DEEMSTER HIMSELF AND THE DEEMSTER HAD SAT THERE AND SEEN THROUGH IT ALL AS THE SUN SEES THROUGH GLASS YET HE HAD GIVEN NO SIGN
2740-288813-0029 HE HAD NEVER SPOKEN HE HAD HELD A QUIVERING NAKED HEART IN HIS HAND WHILE HIS OWN LAY WITHIN AS COLD AS A STONE CURSE HIM O GOD CURSE HIM PETE REMEMBERED THE NIGHT WHEN PHILIP CAME TO TELL HIM THAT KATE WAS DEAD
2740-288813-0030 AND HOW HE HAD COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER ALONE IN HIS GREAT TROUBLE BECAUSE HIS FRIEND WAS WITH HIM HE REMEMBERED THE JOURNEY TO THE GRAVE THE GRAVE ITSELF ANOTHER'S GRAVE
2740-288813-0031 HOW HE KNELT AT THE FOOT OF IT AND PRAYED ALOUD IN PHILIP'S HEARING FORGIVE ME MY POOR GIRL HOW SHALL I KILL HIM THOUGHT PETE DEEMSTER TOO FIRST DEEMSTER NOW AND HELD HIGH IN HONOUR WORSHIPPED FOR HIS JUSTICE
2740-288813-0032 BELOVED FOR HIS MERCY O GOD O GOD THERE ARE PASSIONS SO OVERMASTERING THAT THEY STIFLE SPEECH AND MAN SINKS BACK TO THE ANIMAL WITH AN INARTICULATE SHOUT PETE WENT TO THE PARLOUR AND CAUGHT UP THE MALLET
2740-288813-0033 A FRANTIC THOUGHT HAD FLASHED ON HIM OF KILLING PHILIP AS HE SAT ON THE BENCH WHICH HE HAD DISGRACED ADMINISTERING THE LAW WHICH HE HAD OUTRAGED THE WILD JUSTICE OF THIS IDEA MADE THE BLOOD TO BUBBLE IN HIS EARS HE SAW HIMSELF HOLDING THE DEEMSTER BY THE THROAT
2740-288813-0034 AND CRYING ALOUD TO THE PEOPLE YOU THINK THIS MAN IS A JUST JUDGE HE IS A WHITED SEPULCHRE YOU THINK HE IS AS TRUE AS THE SUN HE IS AS FALSE AS THE SEA HE HAS ROBBED ME OF WIFE AND CHILD
2740-288813-0035 AT THE VERY GATES OF HEAVEN HE HAS LIED TO ME LIKE HELL THE HOUR OF JUSTICE HAS STRUCK AND THUS I PAY HIM AND THUS AND THUS BUT THE POWER OF WORDS WAS LOST IN THE DRUNKENNESS OF HIS RAGE
2740-288813-0036 WITH A DISMAL ROAR HE FLUNG THE MALLET AWAY AND IT ROLLED ON THE GROUND IN NARROWING CIRCLES MY HANDS MY HANDS HE THOUGHT HE WOULD STRANGLE PHILIP AND THEN HE WOULD KILL EVERYBODY IN HIS WAY MERELY FOR THE LUST OF KILLING WHY NOT
2740-288813-0037 THE FATAL LINE WAS PAST NOTHING SACRED REMAINED THE WORLD WAS A HOWLING WILDERNESS OF BOUNDLESS LICENSE WITH THE SAVAGE GROWL OF A CAGED BEAST THIS WILD MAN FLUNG HIMSELF ON THE DOOR TORE IT OPEN AND BOUNDED ON TO THE PATH
2740-288813-0038 THEN HE STOPPED SUDDENLY THERE WAS A THUNDEROUS NOISE OUTSIDE SUCH AS THE WAVES MAKE IN A CAVE A COMPANY OF PEOPLE WERE COMING IN AT THE GATE SOME WERE WALKING WITH THE HEAVY STEP OF MEN WHO CARRY A CORPSE
2740-288813-0039 OTHERS WERE BEARING LANTERNS AND A FEW HELD HIGH OVER THEIR HEADS THE TORCHES WHICH FISHERMEN USE WHEN THEY ARE HAULING THE WHITE NETS AT NIGHT WHO'S THERE CRIED PETE IN A VOICE THAT WAS LIKE A HOWL YOUR FRIEND SAID SOMEBODY
2740-288813-0040 MY FRIEND I HAVE NO FRIEND CRIED PETE IN A BROKEN ROAR DEED HE'S GONE SEEMINGLY SAID A VOICE OUT OF THE DARK PETE DID NOT HEAR SEEING THE CROWD AND THE LIGHTS BUT ONLY AS DARKNESS VEINED WITH FIRE
2740-288813-0041 HE THOUGHT PHILIP WAS COMING AGAIN AS HE HAD SO OFTEN SEEN HIM COME IN HIS GLORY IN HIS GREATNESS IN HIS TRIUMPH WHERE IS HE HE ROARED HE'S HERE THEY ANSWERED AND THEN PHILIP WAS BROUGHT UP THE PATH IN THE ARMS OF FOUR BEARERS HIS HEAD HANGING ASIDE
2740-288813-0042 AND SHAKING AT EVERY STEP HIS FACE WHITE AS THE WIG ABOVE IT AND HIS GOWN TRAILING ALONG THE EARTH THERE WAS A SUDDEN CALM AND PETE DROPPED BACK IN AWE AND HORROR A BOLT OUT OF HEAVEN SEEMED TO HAVE FALLEN AT HIS FEET
2740-288813-0043 AND HE TREMBLED AS IF LIGHTNING HAD BLINDED HIM DEAD HIS ANGER HAD EBBED HIS FURY HAD DASHED ITSELF AGAINST A ROCK HIS TOWERING RAGE HAD SHRUNK TO NOTHING IN THE FACE OF THIS AWFUL PRESENCE
2740-288813-0044 THE DARK SPIRIT HAD GONE BEFORE HIM AND SNATCHED HIS VICTIM OUT OF HIS HANDS HE HAD COME OUT TO KILL THIS MAN AND HERE HE MET HIM BEING BROUGHT HOME DEAD DEAD THEN HIS SIN WAS DEAD ALSO GOD FORGIVE HIM
2740-288813-0045 GOD FORGIVE HIM WHERE HE WAS GONE PRESUMPTUOUS MAN STAND BACK OH MIGHTY AND MERCIFUL DEATH DEATH THE LIBERATOR THE DELIVERER THE PARDONER THE PEACE MAKER EVEN THE SHADOW OF THY FACE CAN QUENCH THE FIRES OF REVENGE
