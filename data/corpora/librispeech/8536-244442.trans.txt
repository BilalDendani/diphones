8536-244442-0009 I'M ANXIOUS TO SEE OUR MOUNTAINS AG'IN THE BOAT SOON REACHED A POINT WHERE LOWER BANKS RAN FOR SOME TIME AND FROM THE CENTER OF THE STREAM THEY SAW THE NOBLE COUNTRY OUTSPREAD BEFORE THEM
8536-244442-0010 A VAST MASS OF SHIMMERING GREEN THE RAIN HAD CEASED ENTIRELY BUT THE WHOLE EARTH WAS SWEET AND CLEAN FROM ITS GREAT BATH LEAVES AND GRASS HAD TAKEN ON A DEEPER TINT
8536-244442-0011 AND THE CRISP AIR WAS KEEN WITH BLOOMING ODORS
8536-244442-0012 THEY MADE GOOD HEADWAY AGAINST IT HARRY'S PRACTICE WITH THE OAR WAS GIVING HIS MUSCLES THE SAME QUALITY LIKE STEEL WIRE WHICH THOSE OF JARVIS AND IKE HAD SO THEY WENT ON FOR THAT DAY AND OTHERS
8536-244442-0013 AND DREW NEAR TO THE HILLS THE EYES OF JARVIS KINDLED
8536-244442-0014 HE SAID AN I AIN'T GOT NOTHIN AG'IN EM I ADMIT THEIR CLAIMS BEFORE THEY MAKE EM BUT MY TRUE LOVE IT'S THE MOUNTAINS AN MY MOUNTAIN HOME
8536-244442-0015 HARRY'S EYES KINDLED TOO I SAY THAT I WANT THE FIRST SHOT JARVIS LAUGHED TRUE SPERRIT HE SAID NOBODY WILL SET UP A CLAIM AG'INST YOU
8536-244442-0016 LESS IT'S THAT LUNKHEAD IKE MY NEPHEW ARE YOU WILLIN TO LET HIM HAVE IT IKE IKE GRINNED AND NODDED THE KENTUCKY NARROWED AND THE CURRENT GREW YET STRONGER
8536-244442-0017 BUT CHANGING OFTENER AT THE OARS THEY STILL MADE GOOD HEADWAY THE RANGES DARK GREEN ON THE LOWER SLOPES BUT BLUE ON THE HIGHER RIDGES BEYOND THEM SLOWLY CAME NEARER
8536-244442-0018 AND WHEN NIGHT CAME THEY HAD LEFT THE LOWLANDS SEVERAL MILES BEHIND THEY TIED UP TO A GREAT BEECH GROWING ALMOST AT THE WATER'S EDGE AND MADE THEIR CAMP ON THE GROUND HARRY'S DEER
8536-244442-0019 DID NOT COME THAT NIGHT BUT IT DID ON THE FOLLOWING ONE THEN JARVIS AND HE AFTER SUPPER WENT ABOUT A MILE UP THE STREAM STALKING THE BEST DRINKING PLACES
8536-244442-0020 COME GINGERLY TO THE RIVER HARRY WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BRING HIM DOWN WITH THE FIRST SHOT AN ACHIEVEMENT THAT FILLED HIM WITH PRIDE AND JARVIS SOON SKINNED AND DRESSED THE ANIMAL ADDING HIM TO THEIR LARDER
8536-244442-0021 I DON'T SHOOT DEER CEPT WHEN I NEED EM TO EAT SAID JARVIS AN WE DO NEED THIS ONE WE'LL BROIL STRIPS OF HIM OVER THE COALS IN THE MORNIN DON'T YOUR MOUTH WATER HARRY
8536-244442-0022 IT DOES THE STRIPS PROVED THE NEXT DAY TO BE ALL THAT JARVIS HAD PROMISED AND THEY CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY WITH RENEWED ELASTICITY FAIR WEATHER KEEPING THEM COMPANY
8536-244442-0023 DEEPER AND DEEPER THEY WENT INTO THE MOUNTAINS THE REGION HAD ALL THE ASPECTS OF A COMPLETE WILDERNESS NOW AND THEN THEY SAW SMOKE WHICH JARVIS SAID
8536-244442-0024 WAS RISING FROM THE CHIMNEYS OF LOG CABINS AND ONCE OR TWICE THEY SAW CABINS THEMSELVES IN SHELTERED NOOKS BUT NOBODY HAILED THEM THE NEWS OF THE WAR HAD SPREAD HERE OF COURSE
8536-244442-0025 BUT HARRY SURMISED THAT IT HAD MADE THE MOUNTAINEERS CAUTIOUS SUPPRESSING THEIR NATURAL CURIOSITY HE DID NOT OBJECT AT ALL TO THEIR RETICENCE AS IT MADE TRAVELING EASIER FOR HIM
8536-244442-0026 THEY WERE NOW ROWING ALONG A SOUTHERLY FORK OF THE KENTUCKY ANOTHER DEER HAD BEEN KILLED FALLING THIS TIME TO THE RIFLE OF JARVIS AND ONE NIGHT THEY SHOT
8536-244442-0027 TWO WILD TURKEYS JARVIS AND HIS NEPHEW WOULD ARRIVE HOME FULL HANDED IN EVERY RESPECT AND HIS GREAT TENOR BOOMED OUT JOYOUSLY OVER THE STREAM
8536-244442-0028 SPEEDING AWAY IN ECHOES AMONG THE LOFTY PEAKS AND RIDGES THAT HAD NOW TURNED FROM HILLS INTO REAL MOUNTAINS THEY TOWERED FAR ABOVE THE STREAM AND EVERYWHERE
8536-244442-0029 THERE WERE MASSES OF THE DEEPEST AND DENSEST GREEN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST CLOTHED THE WHOLE EARTH AND THE WAR TO WHICH HARRY WAS GOING SEEMED A FAINT AND FAR THING
8536-244442-0030 TRAVELING NOW BECAME SLOW BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS HAD A STRONG CURRENT TO FIGHT HARRY AT TIMES WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS NOT TOO ROUGH LEFT THE BOAT AND WALKED ALONG THE BANK
8536-244442-0031 HE COULD GO THUS FOR MILES WITHOUT FEELING ANY WEARINESS NATURALLY VERY STRONG HE DID NOT REALIZE HOW MUCH HIS WORK AT THE OAR WAS INCREASING HIS POWER THE THIN
8536-244442-0032 VITAL AIR OF THE MOUNTAINS FLOWED THROUGH HIS LUNGS AND WHEN JARVIS SANG AS HE DID SO OFTEN HE FELT THAT HE COULD LIFT UP HIS FEET AND MARCH AS IF TO THE BEAT OF A DRUM
8536-244442-0033 THEY LEFT THE FORK OF THE KENTUCKY AT LAST AND ROWED UP ONE OF THE DEEP AND NARROW MOUNTAIN CREEKS PEAKS TOWERED ALL ABOUT THEM A HALF MILE OVER THEIR HEADS
8536-244442-0034 SOMETIMES THE CREEK FLOWED BETWEEN CLIFFS AND AGAIN IT OPENED OUT INTO NARROW VALLEYS IN A TWO DAYS JOURNEY UP ITS COURSE THEY PASSED ONLY TWO CABINS
8536-244442-0035 IN ORDINARY WATER
8536-244442-0036 SAID JARVIS AT THE SECOND CABIN I KNOW THE MAN WHO LIVES IN IT AN HE'S TO BE TRUSTED WE'D HAVE LEFT THE BOAT AN THE THINGS WITH HIM
8536-244442-0037 BUT THE CREEK IS SO HIGH NOW THAT WE KIN MAKE AT LEAST TWENTY MILES MORE AN TIE UP AT BILL RUDD'S PLACE
8536-244442-0038 AN THIS BOAT IS TOO HEAVY TO BE CARRIED AROUND IT THEY REACHED RUDD'S PLACE ABOUT DARK HE WAS A HOSPITABLE MOUNTAINEER WITH A DOUBLE ROOMED LOG CABIN A WIFE
8536-244442-0039 AND TWO SMALL CHILDREN HE VOLUNTEERED GLADLY TO TAKE CARE OF THE BOAT AND ITS BELONGINGS WHILE JARVIS AND THE BOYS WENT ON THE NEXT DAY TO JARVIS'S HOME ABOUT TEN MILES AWAY RUDD
8536-244442-0040 AND HIS WIFE WERE FULL OF QUESTIONS THEY WERE EAGER TO HEAR OF THE GREAT WORLD WHICH WAS REPRESENTED TO THEM BY FRANKFORT AND OF THE WAR IN THE LOWLANDS CONCERNING WHICH THEY HAD HEARD VAGUELY
8536-244442-0041 RUDD HAD BEEN TO FRANKFORT ONCE AND FELT HIMSELF A TRAVELER
8536-244442-0042 HE AND HIS WIFE KNEW JARVIS AND IKE WELL AND THEY GLANCED RATHER CURIOUSLY AT HARRY
8536-244442-0043 AN DOWN INTO VIRGINIA ON SOME BUSINESS OF HIS OWN
8536-244442-0044 SAID JARVIS HARRY SLEPT IN A HOUSE THAT NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DAYS AND HE DID NOT LIKE IT HE AWOKE ONCE WITH A FEELING AS IF WALLS WERE PRESSING DOWN UPON HIM
8536-244442-0045 AND HE COULD NOT BREATHE HE AROSE OPENED THE DOOR AND STOOD BY IT FOR A FEW MINUTES WHILE THE FRESH AIR POURED IN JARVIS AWOKE AND CHUCKLED
8536-244442-0046 I KNOW WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU HARRY HE SAID
8536-244442-0047 YOU FEEL PENNED UP IN HOUSES IF IT WASN'T FOR RAIN AN SNOW I'D DO WITHOUT ROOFS CEPT IN WINTER LEAVE THE DOOR WIDE OPEN AN WE'LL BOTH SLEEP BETTER
8536-244442-0048 NOTHIN OF COURSE WOULD WAKE THAT LUNKHEAD
