5054-1187-0000 CHAPTER NINE THEY MEET THE WOOZY THERE SEEM TO BE VERY FEW HOUSES AROUND HERE AFTER ALL REMARKED OJO AFTER THEY HAD WALKED FOR A TIME IN SILENCE NEVER MIND SAID SCRAPS WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR HOUSES
5054-1187-0001 BUT RATHER THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS WON'T IT BE FUNNY TO RUN ACROSS SOMETHING YELLOW IN THIS DISMAL BLUE COUNTRY THERE ARE WORSE COLORS THAN YELLOW IN THIS COUNTRY ASSERTED THE GLASS CAT IN A SPITEFUL TONE OH
5054-1187-0002 DO YOU MEAN THE PINK PEBBLES YOU CALL YOUR BRAINS AND YOUR RED HEART AND GREEN EYES ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL NO I MEAN YOU IF YOU MUST KNOW IT GROWLED THE CAT
5054-1187-0003 LAUGHED SCRAPS YOU'D GIVE YOUR WHISKERS FOR A LOVELY VARIEGATED COMPLEXION LIKE MINE I WOULDN'T RETORTED THE CAT I'VE THE CLEAREST COMPLEXION IN THE WORLD AND I DON'T EMPLOY A BEAUTY DOCTOR EITHER
5054-1187-0004 I SEE YOU DON'T SAID SCRAPS PLEASE DON'T QUARREL BEGGED OJO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT JOURNEY AND QUARRELING MAKES ME DISCOURAGED TO BE BRAVE ONE MUST BE CHEERFUL SO I HOPE YOU WILL BE AS GOOD TEMPERED AS POSSIBLE
5054-1187-0005 THEY HAD TRAVELED SOME DISTANCE WHEN SUDDENLY THEY FACED A HIGH FENCE WHICH BARRED ANY FURTHER PROGRESS STRAIGHT AHEAD IT RAN DIRECTLY ACROSS THE ROAD AND ENCLOSED A SMALL FOREST OF TALL TREES SET CLOSE TOGETHER
5054-1187-0006 WHEN THE GROUP OF ADVENTURERS PEERED THROUGH THE BARS OF THE FENCE THEY THOUGHT THIS FOREST LOOKED MORE GLOOMY AND FORBIDDING THAN ANY THEY HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE THEY SOON DISCOVERED THAT THE PATH THEY HAD BEEN FOLLOWING NOW MADE A BEND AND PASSED AROUND THE ENCLOSURE
5054-1187-0007 OR THEY WOULDN'T TELL PEOPLE TO BEWARE OF IT LET'S KEEP OUT THEN REPLIED SCRAPS THAT PATH IS OUTSIDE THE FENCE AND MISTER WOOZY MAY HAVE ALL HIS LITTLE FOREST TO HIMSELF FOR ALL WE CARE BUT ONE OF OUR ERRANDS IS TO FIND A WOOZY
5054-1187-0008 OJO EXPLAINED THE MAGICIAN WANTS ME TO GET THREE HAIRS FROM THE END OF A WOOZY'S TAIL LET'S GO ON AND FIND SOME OTHER WOOZY SUGGESTED THE CAT THIS ONE IS UGLY AND DANGEROUS OR THEY WOULDN'T CAGE HIM UP
5054-1187-0009 THEN SAID SCRAPS SUPPOSE WE GO IN AND FIND HIM VERY LIKELY IF WE ASK HIM POLITELY TO LET US PULL THREE HAIRS OUT OF THE TIP OF HIS TAIL HE WON'T HURT US IT WOULD HURT HIM I'M SURE
5054-1187-0010 THE BOY ADMITTED BUT THIS DANGER MUST BE FACED IF WE INTEND TO SAVE POOR UNC NUNKIE HOW SHALL WE GET OVER THE FENCE CLIMB ANSWERED SCRAPS AND AT ONCE SHE BEGAN CLIMBING UP THE ROWS OF BARS OJO FOLLOWED
5054-1187-0011 AND FOUND IT MORE EASY THAN HE HAD EXPECTED WHEN THEY GOT TO THE TOP OF THE FENCE THEY BEGAN TO GET DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE AND SOON WERE IN THE FOREST THE GLASS CAT BEING SMALL CREPT BETWEEN THE LOWER BARS AND JOINED THEM
5054-1187-0012 HERE THERE WAS NO PATH OF ANY SORT SO THEY ENTERED THE WOODS THE BOY LEADING THE WAY AND WANDERED THROUGH THE TREES UNTIL THEY WERE NEARLY IN THE CENTER OF THE FOREST THEY NOW CAME UPON A CLEAR SPACE
5054-1187-0013 BUT STILL MORE TERRIFYING IS IT TO FACE AN UNKNOWN BEAST WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN EVEN A PICTURE OF SO THERE IS LITTLE WONDER THAT THE PULSES OF THE MUNCHKIN BOY BEAT FAST AS HE AND HIS COMPANIONS STOOD FACING THE CAVE
5054-1187-0014 THE OPENING WAS PERFECTLY SQUARE AND ABOUT BIG ENOUGH TO ADMIT A GOAT I GUESS THE WOOZY IS ASLEEP SAID SCRAPS SHALL I THROW IN A STONE TO WAKEN HIM NO PLEASE DON'T ANSWERED OJO
5054-1187-0015 HIS VOICE TREMBLING A LITTLE I'M IN NO HURRY BUT HE HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT FOR THE WOOZY HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES AND CAME TROTTING OUT OF HIS CAVE AS THIS IS THE ONLY WOOZY THAT HAS EVER LIVED
5054-1187-0016 EITHER IN THE LAND OF OZ OR OUT OF IT I MUST DESCRIBE IT TO YOU THE CREATURE WAS ALL SQUARES AND FLAT SURFACES AND EDGES ITS HEAD WAS AN EXACT SQUARE LIKE ONE OF THE BUILDING BLOCKS A CHILD PLAYS WITH THEREFORE
5054-1187-0017 IT HAD NO EARS BUT HEARD SOUNDS THROUGH TWO OPENINGS IN THE UPPER CORNERS ITS NOSE BEING IN THE CENTER OF A SQUARE SURFACE WAS FLAT WHILE THE MOUTH WAS FORMED BY THE OPENING OF THE LOWER EDGE OF THE BLOCK
5054-1187-0018 EACH BEING FOUR SIDED THE ANIMAL WAS COVERED WITH A THICK SMOOTH SKIN AND HAD NO HAIR AT ALL EXCEPT AT THE EXTREME END OF ITS TAIL WHERE THERE GREW EXACTLY THREE STIFF STUBBY HAIRS
5054-1187-0019 IT IS PLAIN TO ME THAT YOU ARE A REMARKABLE GROUP AS REMARKABLE IN YOUR WAY AS I AM IN MINE AND SO YOU ARE WELCOME TO MY DOMAIN NICE PLACE ISN'T IT BUT LONESOME DREADFULLY LONESOME
5054-1187-0020 ASKED SCRAPS WHO WAS REGARDING THE QUEER SQUARE CREATURE WITH MUCH CURIOSITY BECAUSE I EAT UP ALL THE HONEY BEES WHICH THE MUNCHKIN FARMERS WHO LIVE AROUND HERE KEEP TO MAKE THEM HONEY ARE YOU FOND OF EATING HONEY BEES
5054-1187-0021 INQUIRED THE BOY VERY THEY ARE REALLY DELICIOUS BUT THE FARMERS DID NOT LIKE TO LOSE THEIR BEES AND SO THEY TRIED TO DESTROY ME OF COURSE THEY COULDN'T DO THAT WHY NOT
5054-1187-0022 MY SKIN IS SO THICK AND TOUGH THAT NOTHING CAN GET THROUGH IT TO HURT ME SO FINDING THEY COULD NOT DESTROY ME THEY DROVE ME INTO THIS FOREST AND BUILT A FENCE AROUND ME UNKIND WASN'T IT
5054-1187-0023 ASKED OJO NOTHING AT ALL I'VE TRIED THE LEAVES FROM THE TREES AND THE MOSSES AND CREEPING VINES BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO SUIT MY TASTE SO THERE BEING NO HONEY BEES HERE I'VE EATEN NOTHING FOR YEARS
5054-1187-0024 YOU MUST BE AWFULLY HUNGRY SAID THE BOY I'VE GOT SOME BREAD AND CHEESE IN MY BASKET WOULD YOU LIKE THAT KIND OF FOOD GIVE ME A NIBBLE AND I WILL TRY IT THEN I CAN TELL YOU BETTER WHETHER IT IS GRATEFUL TO MY APPETITE

5054-1187-0027 SO HE SAT DOWN ON A STUMP AND FED THE WOOZY BREAD AND CHEESE FOR A LONG TIME FOR NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE BOY BROKE OFF THE LOAF AND THE SLICE REMAINED JUST AS BIG THAT'LL DO SAID THE WOOZY AT LAST
5054-1187-0028 NAME THE FAVOR AND I WILL GRANT IT I I WANT THREE HAIRS FROM THE TIP OF YOUR TAIL SAID OJO WITH SOME HESITATION THREE HAIRS WHY THAT'S ALL I HAVE
5054-1187-0029 ON MY TAIL OR ANYWHERE ELSE EXCLAIMED THE BEAST I KNOW BUT I WANT THEM VERY MUCH
5054-1187-0030 MY PRETTIEST FEATURE SAID THE WOOZY UNEASILY IF I GIVE UP THOSE THREE HAIRS I I'M JUST A BLOCKHEAD YET I MUST HAVE THEM INSISTED THE BOY FIRMLY
5054-1187-0031 AND HE THEN TOLD THE WOOZY ALL ABOUT THE ACCIDENT TO UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE
5054-1187-0032 THAT WOULD RESTORE THEM TO LIFE THE BEAST LISTENED WITH ATTENTION AND WHEN OJO HAD FINISHED THE RECITAL IT SAID WITH A SIGH I ALWAYS KEEP MY WORD FOR I PRIDE MYSELF ON BEING SQUARE SO
5054-1187-0033 YOU MAY HAVE THE THREE HAIRS AND WELCOME I THINK UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD BE SELFISH IN ME TO REFUSE YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH CRIED THE BOY JOYFULLY MAY I PULL OUT THE HAIRS NOW
5054-1187-0034 ANY TIME YOU LIKE ANSWERED THE WOOZY SO OJO WENT UP TO THE QUEER CREATURE AND TAKING HOLD OF ONE OF THE HAIRS BEGAN TO PULL HE PULLED HARDER HE PULLED WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
5054-1187-0035 PANTING I WAS AFRAID OF THAT DECLARED THE BEAST YOU'LL HAVE TO PULL HARDER I'LL HELP YOU EXCLAIMED SCRAPS COMING TO THE BOY'S SIDE YOU PULL THE HAIR
5054-1187-0036 IT SLIPPED OUT OF OJO'S HANDS AND HE AND SCRAPS BOTH ROLLED UPON THE GROUND IN A HEAP AND NEVER STOPPED UNTIL THEY BUMPED AGAINST THE ROCKY CAVE GIVE IT UP ADVISED THE GLASS CAT
5054-1187-0037 AS THE BOY AROSE AND ASSISTED THE PATCHWORK GIRL TO HER FEET A DOZEN STRONG MEN COULDN'T PULL OUT THOSE HAIRS I BELIEVE THEY'RE CLINCHED ON THE UNDER SIDE OF THE WOOZY'S THICK SKIN THEN WHAT SHALL I DO
5054-1187-0038 ASKED THE BOY DESPAIRINGLY IF ON OUR RETURN I FAIL TO TAKE THESE THREE HAIRS TO THE CROOKED MAGICIAN THE OTHER THINGS I HAVE COME TO SEEK WILL BE OF NO USE AT ALL AND WE CANNOT RESTORE UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE TO LIFE
5054-1187-0039 HE WAS SO DISHEARTENED THAT HE SAT DOWN UPON A STUMP AND BEGAN TO CRY THE WOOZY LOOKED AT THE BOY THOUGHTFULLY WHY DON'T YOU TAKE ME WITH YOU ASKED THE BEAST THEN WHEN AT LAST YOU GET TO THE MAGICIAN'S HOUSE
5054-1187-0040 WIPING AWAY THE TEARS AND SPRINGING TO HIS FEET WITH A SMILE IF I TAKE THE THREE HAIRS TO THE MAGICIAN IT WON'T MATTER IF THEY ARE STILL IN YOUR BODY IT CAN'T MATTER IN THE LEAST AGREED THE WOOZY COME ON THEN
5054-1187-0041 THEY WALKED THROUGH THE FOREST TO THE FENCE REACHING IT AT A POINT EXACTLY OPPOSITE THAT WHERE THEY HAD ENTERED THE ENCLOSURE HOW DID YOU GET IN ASKED THE WOOZY WE CLIMBED OVER ANSWERED OJO I CAN'T DO THAT
5054-1187-0042 SAID THE BEAST I'M A VERY SWIFT RUNNER FOR I CAN OVERTAKE A HONEY BEE AS IT FLIES AND I CAN JUMP VERY HIGH WHICH IS THE REASON THEY MADE SUCH A TALL FENCE TO KEEP ME IN BUT I CAN'T CLIMB AT ALL AND I'M TOO BIG TO SQUEEZE BETWEEN THE BARS OF THE FENCE
5054-1187-0043 YOU'RE NOT SUCH A TERRIBLE CREATURE AFTER ALL REMARKED SCRAPS YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ME GROWL OR YOU WOULDN'T SAY THAT DECLARED THE WOOZY WHEN I GROWL THE SOUND ECHOES LIKE THUNDER ALL THROUGH THE VALLEYS AND WOODLANDS
5054-1187-0044 AND CHILDREN TREMBLE WITH FEAR AND WOMEN COVER THEIR HEADS WITH THEIR APRONS AND BIG MEN RUN AND HIDE I SUPPOSE THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD SO TERRIBLE TO LISTEN TO AS THE GROWL OF A WOOZY
5054-1187-0045 PLEASE DON'T GROWL THEN BEGGED OJO EARNESTLY THERE IS NO DANGER OF MY GROWLING FOR I AM NOT ANGRY ONLY WHEN ANGRY DO I UTTER MY FEARFUL EAR SPLITTING SOUL SHUDDERING GROWL
5054-1187-0046 ALSO WHEN I AM ANGRY MY EYES FLASH FIRE WHETHER I GROWL OR NOT REAL FIRE ASKED OJO OF COURSE REAL FIRE
5054-1187-0047 INQUIRED THE WOOZY IN AN INJURED TONE IN THAT CASE I'VE SOLVED THE RIDDLE CRIED SCRAPS DANCING WITH GLEE THOSE FENCE BOARDS ARE MADE OF WOOD AND IF THE WOOZY STANDS CLOSE TO THE FENCE AND LETS HIS EYES FLASH FIRE
5054-1187-0048 THEY MIGHT SET FIRE TO THE FENCE AND BURN IT UP THEN HE COULD WALK AWAY WITH US EASILY BEING FREE AH I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT PLAN OR I WOULD HAVE BEEN FREE LONG AGO SAID THE WOOZY BUT

5054-1187-0052 SAID HE FOR THE FLAMES WOULD ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE MUNCHKIN FARMERS WHO WOULD THEN COME AND CAPTURE THE WOOZY AGAIN I GUESS THEY'LL BE RATHER SURPRISED WHEN THEY FIND HE'S ESCAPED SO THEY WILL DECLARED THE WOOZY
5054-1187-0053 CHUCKLING GLEEFULLY WHEN THEY FIND I'M GONE THE FARMERS WILL BE BADLY SCARED FOR THEY'LL EXPECT ME TO EAT UP THEIR HONEY BEES AS I DID BEFORE THAT REMINDS ME SAID THE BOY
5054-1187-0054 THAT YOU MUST PROMISE NOT TO EAT HONEY BEES WHILE YOU ARE IN OUR COMPANY NONE AT ALL NOT A BEE YOU WOULD GET US ALL INTO TROUBLE AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE ANY MORE TROUBLE THAN IS NECESSARY
