3070-166423-0000 MY DREAD OF AGAIN PASSING THROUGH THAT HAUNTED VALE I CERTAINLY DO
3070-166423-0001 DRAKE DON'T YOU AGREE SURE HE REPLIED SURE I'LL LOOK AFTER RUTH ER
3070-166423-0002 THE GLINT OF AMUSEMENT IN VENTNOR'S EYES AT THIS FADED ABRUPTLY HIS FACE GREW SOMBER WAIT HE SAID I CARRIED AWAY SOME SOME EXHIBITS FROM THE CREVICE OF THE NOISES GOODWIN WHAT KIND OF EXHIBITS I ASKED EAGERLY
3070-166423-0003 PUT EM WHERE THEY'D BE SAFE HE CONTINUED I'VE AN IDEA THEY'RE FAR MORE CURIOUS THAN OUR ARMORED MEN AND OF FAR MORE IMPORTANCE AT ANY RATE WE MUST TAKE THEM WITH US GO WITH RUTH YOU AND DRAKE AND LOOK AT THEM
3070-166423-0004 BUT HURRY HE TURNED BACK TO HIS WATCH ORDERING CHIU MING TO STAY WITH HIM I FOLLOWED RUTH AND DRAKE DOWN THE RUINED STAIRWAY AT THE BOTTOM SHE CAME TO ME LAID LITTLE HANDS ON MY SHOULDERS WALTER SHE BREATHED I'M FRIGHTENED
3070-166423-0005 I'M SO FRIGHTENED I'M AFRAID TO TELL EVEN MART HE DOESN'T LIKE THEM EITHER THESE LITTLE THINGS YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HE LIKES THEM SO LITTLE THAT HE'S AFRAID TO LET ME KNOW HOW LITTLE HE DOES LIKE THEM BUT WHAT ARE THEY WHAT'S TO FEAR ABOUT THEM
3070-166423-0006 MARTIN PICKED THEM UP AND DROPPED THEM IN A SACK BEFORE WE RAN THROUGH THE HOLLOW THEY'RE GROTESQUE AND THEY'RE ALMOST CUTE AND THEY MAKE ME FEEL AS THOUGH THEY WERE THE TINIEST TIPPY TIP OF THE CLAW OF SOME INCREDIBLY LARGE CAT JUST
3070-166423-0007 STEALING AROUND THE CORNER A TERRIBLE CAT A CAT AS BIG AS A MOUNTAIN SHE ENDED BREATHLESSLY WE CLIMBED THROUGH THE CRUMBLING MASONRY INTO A CENTRAL OPEN COURT HERE A CLEAR SPRING BUBBLED UP IN A RUINED AND CHOKED STONE BASIN
3070-166423-0008 CLOSE TO THE ANCIENT WELL WAS THEIR PONY CONTENTEDLY BROWSING IN THE THICK GRASS THAT GREW AROUND IT FROM ONE OF ITS HAMPERS RUTH TOOK A LARGE CLOTH BAG TO CARRY THEM SHE SAID AND TREMBLED
3070-166423-0009 AND IT WAS IN BETTER PRESERVATION THE CEILING UNBROKEN THE LIGHT DIM AFTER THE BLAZING SUN OF THE COURT NEAR ITS CENTER SHE HALTED US BEFORE ME RAN A TWO FEET WIDE RAGGED CRACK SPLITTING THE FLOOR AND DROPPING DOWN INTO BLACK DEPTHS
3070-166423-0010 BEYOND WAS AN EXPANSE OF SMOOTH FLAGGING ALMOST CLEAR OF DEBRIS DRAKE GAVE A LOW WHISTLE I FOLLOWED HIS POINTING FINGER
3070-166423-0011 IN THE DUST COVERED FLOOR NOT MORE THAN A FOOT IN WIDTH
3070-166423-0012 METALLIC BLUISH LUSTER AS THOUGH I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN RECENTLY POLISHED COMPARED WITH THE WALL'S TREMENDOUS WINGED FIGURES THIS FLOOR DESIGN WAS TRIVIAL LUDICROUSLY INSIGNIFICANT
3070-166423-0013 SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER WITH MATHEMATICAL EXACTNESS BY ANOTHER INCH OF SPACE I COUNTED THEM THERE WERE NINETEEN ALMOST TOUCHING THEM WITH THEIR BASES WERE AN EQUAL NUMBER OF PYRAMIDS OF TETRAHEDRONS AS SHARPLY ANGLED AND OF SIMILAR LENGTH
3070-166423-0014 THEY LAY ON THEIR SIDES WITH TIPS POINTING STARLIKE TO SIX SPHERES CLUSTERED LIKE A CONVENTIONALIZED FIVE PETALED PRIMROSE IN THE EXACT CENTER FIVE OF THESE SPHERES THE PETALS
3070-166423-0015 AND STIFFENED THE FIRST TOUCH OF DREAD UPON ME FOR WITHIN THE RING
3070-166423-0016 IT STOOD OUT FROM THE DUST WITH THE SAME HINT OF CRUSHING FORCE THE SAME DIE CUT SHARPNESS THE SAME METALLIC SUGGESTION AND POINTING TOWARD THE GLOBES WERE THE CLAW MARKS OF THE FOUR SPREADING STAR POINTS
3070-166423-0017 I WEIGHED IT IN MY HAND IT WAS ODDLY HEAVY TWICE THE WEIGHT I SHOULD SAY OF PLATINUM
3070-166423-0018 YET IT WAS AS CERTAINLY METAL IT WAS STRIATED SLENDER FILAMENTS RADIATING FROM TINY DULLY LUSTROUS POINTS WITHIN THE POLISHED SURFACE AND SUDDENLY I HAD THE WEIRD FEELING THAT EACH OF THESE POINTS WAS AN EYE
3070-166423-0019 THE PYRAMIDS RAISED THEMSELVES STOOD BOLT UPRIGHT ON THEIR SQUARE BASES THE SIX ROLLING SPHERES TOUCHED THEM JOINED THE SPINNING AND WITH SLEIGHT OF HAND SUDDENNESS THE RING DREW TOGETHER ITS UNITS COALESCED
3070-166423-0020 A VAGUELY TERRIFYING FOOT HIGH SHAPE SQUARED AND ANGLED AND POINTED AND ANIMATE AS THOUGH A CHILD SHOULD BUILD FROM NURSERY BLOCKS A FANTASTIC SHAPE WHICH ABRUPTLY IS FILLED WITH THROBBING LIFE
3070-166423-0021 THEIR SHIFTINGS WERE LIKE THE TRANSFORMATIONS ONE SEES WITHIN A KALEIDOSCOPE AND IN EACH VANISHING FORM WAS THE SUGGESTION OF UNFAMILIAR HARMONIES OF A SUBTLE A TRANSCENDENTAL GEOMETRIC ART AS THOUGH EACH SWIFT SHAPING WERE A SYMBOL A WORD
3070-166423-0022 THE FIVE SPHERES FOLLOWED IT CLUSTERED LIKE A RING JUST BELOW IT THE OTHER CUBES RACED UP CLICKED TWO BY TWO ON THE OUTER ARC OF EACH OF THE FIVE BALLS AT THE ENDS OF THESE TWIN BLOCKS A PYRAMID TOOK ITS PLACE TIPPING EACH WITH A POINT
3070-166423-0023 FROM WHICH SPRANG A STAR OF FIVE ARMS THE SPHERES BEGAN TO REVOLVE FASTER AND FASTER THEY SPUN AROUND THE BASE OF THE CROWNING GLOBE
3070-166423-0024 CLUSTERED VANISHED ONLY TO REAPPEAR IN GREATER NUMBER THE TROLL SWEPT TOWARD ME IT GLIDED THE FINGER OF PANIC TOUCHED ME I SPRANG ASIDE AND SWIFT AS LIGHT IT FOLLOWED SEEMED TO POISE ITSELF TO LEAP DROP IT IT WAS RUTH'S CRY
3070-166423-0025 BUT BEFORE I COULD LET FALL THE PYRAMID I HAD FORGOTTEN WAS IN MY HAND THE LITTLE FIGURE TOUCHED ME AND A PARALYZING SHOCK RAN THROUGH ME MY FINGERS CLENCHED LOCKED I STOOD MUSCLE AND NERVE BOUND UNABLE TO MOVE THE LITTLE FIGURE PAUSED
3070-166423-0026 IT WAS AS THOUGH IT COCKED ITS HEAD TO LOOK UP AT ME AND AGAIN I HAD THE SENSE OF INNUMERABLE EYES PEERING AT ME IT DID NOT SEEM MENACING ITS ATTITUDE WAS INQUISITIVE WAITING ALMOST AS THOUGH IT HAD ASKED FOR SOMETHING AND
3070-166423-0027 WONDERED WHY I DID NOT LET IT HAVE IT THE SHOCK STILL HELD ME RIGID
3070-166423-0028 THE DISC TILTED BACK TO PLACE BENT TOWARD ME AGAIN I HEARD A SHOUT HEARD A BULLET STRIKE THE PIGMY THAT NOW CLEARLY MENACED HEARD THE BULLET RICOCHET WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST EFFECT UPON IT DICK LEAPED BESIDE ME
3070-166423-0029 AND UPON THE INSTANT HE CRASHED DOWN AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A GIANT HAND LAY SPRAWLING AND INERT UPON THE FLOOR THERE WAS A SCREAM FROM RUTH
3070-166423-0030 THERE WAS A CURIOUS SHARP TANG OF OZONE IN THE AIR A PERCEPTIBLE TIGHTENING AS OF ELECTRICAL TENSION THEY SWEPT TO THE EDGE OF THE FISSURE SWAM TOGETHER AND THERE HANGING HALF OVER THE GAP WAS A BRIDGE HALF SPANNING IT A WEIRD AND FAIRY ARCH
3070-166423-0031 MADE UP OF ALTERNATE CUBE AND ANGLE THE SHAPE AT MY FEET DISINTEGRATED
3070-166423-0032 I DROPPED IT THE TINY SHAPE SWEPT TO THE BRIDGE ASCENDED IT DROPPED INTO THE GAP THE ARCH WAS COMPLETE HANGING IN ONE FLYING SPAN OVER THE DEPTHS UPON IT OVER IT AS THOUGH THEY HAD BUT AWAITED THIS COMPLETION
3070-166423-0033 ROLLED THE SIX GLOBES AND AS THEY DROPPED TO THE FARTHER SIDE
3070-166423-0034 CURVED ITSELF LIKE A SCORPION'S TAIL DREW ITSELF INTO A CLOSER CIRCLED ARC AND DROPPED UPON THE FLOOR BEYOND AGAIN THE SIBILANT RUSTLING
3070-166423-0035 GOODWIN HE WHISPERED WHAT WHAT WERE THEY METAL I SAID IT WAS THE ONLY WORD TO WHICH MY WHIRLING MIND COULD CLING METAL
3070-166423-0036 METAL HE ECHOED THESE THINGS METAL METAL ALIVE AND THINKING SUDDENLY HE WAS SILENT HIS FACE A PAGE ON WHICH VISIBLY
3070-166423-0037 DREAD GATHERED SLOWLY AND EVER DEEPER AND AS I LOOKED AT RUTH WHITE FACED AND AT HIM I KNEW THAT MY OWN WAS AS PALLID AS TERROR STRICKEN AS THEIRS THEY WERE SUCH LITTLE THINGS MUTTERED DRAKE
3070-166423-0038 SUCH LITTLE THINGS BITS OF METAL LITTLE GLOBES AND PYRAMIDS AND CUBES JUST LITTLE THINGS BABES ONLY BABES IT WAS RUTH BABES
3070-166423-0039 BITS OF METAL DICK'S GAZE SOUGHT MINE HELD IT AND THEY LOOKED FOR EACH OTHER THEY WORKED WITH EACH OTHER THINKINGLY CONSCIOUSLY THEY WERE DELIBERATE PURPOSEFUL LITTLE THINGS
3070-166423-0040 AND WITH THE FORCE OF A SCORE OF DYNAMOS LIVING THINKING DON'T RUTH LAID WHITE HANDS OVER HIS EYES DON'T DON'T YOU BE FRIGHTENED FRIGHTENED HE ECHOED I'M NOT AFRAID YES
3070-166423-0041 FOR WHAT WE HAD BEHELD IN THE DUSK OF THAT DRAGONED RUINED CHAMBER WAS OUTSIDE ALL EXPERIENCE BEYOND ALL KNOWLEDGE OR DREAM OF SCIENCE NOT THEIR SHAPES THAT WAS NOTHING NOT EVEN THAT BEING METAL THEY HAD MOVED
3070-166423-0042 BUT THAT BEING METAL THEY HAD MOVED CONSCIOUSLY THOUGHTFULLY DELIBERATELY THEY WERE METAL THINGS WITH MINDS THAT THAT WAS THE INCREDIBLE THE TERRIFYING THING THAT AND THEIR POWER
