4821-27466-0000 AFTER WE'D FAIRLY SETTLED TO STAY FATHER BEGAN TO BE MORE PLEASANT THAN HE'D EVER BEEN BEFORE WE WERE PRETTY LIKELY HE SAID TO HAVE A VISIT FROM STARLIGHT AND THE HALF CASTE IN A DAY OR TWO IF WE'D LIKE TO WAIT
4821-27466-0001 HE WAS TO MEET HIM AT THE HOLLOW ON PURPOSE TO HELP HIM OUT WITH THE MOB OF FAT BULLOCKS WE HAD LOOKED AT FATHER IT APPEARS WAS COMING HERE BY HIMSELF WHEN HE MET THIS OUTLYING LOT OF MISTER HUNTER'S CATTLE
4821-27466-0002 AND THOUGHT HE AND OLD CRIB COULD BRING THEM IN BY THEMSELVES AND A MIGHTY GOOD HAUL IT WAS FATHER SAID WE SHOULD SHARE THE WEANERS BETWEEN THE THREE OF US THAT MEANT FIFTY POUNDS A PIECE AT LEAST THE DEVIL ALWAYS HELPS BEGINNERS
4821-27466-0003 WE PUT THROUGH A COUPLE OF DAYS PLEASANTLY ENOUGH AFTER OUR HARDISH BIT OF WORK JIM FOUND SOME FISH HOOKS AND A LINE AND WE CAUGHT PLENTY OF MULLET AND EELS IN THE DEEP CLEAR WATERHOLES
4821-27466-0004 WE FOUND A COUPLE OF DOUBLE BARRELLED GUNS AND SHOT DUCKS ENOUGH TO LAST US A WEEK NO WONDER THE OLD FREQUENTERS OF THE HOLLOW USED TO LIVE HERE FOR A MONTH AT A TIME HAVING GREAT TIMES OF IT AS LONG AS THEIR GROG LASTED
4821-27466-0005 AND SOMETIMES HAVING THE TRIBE OF BLACKS THAT INHABITED THE DISTRICT TO MAKE MERRY AND CAROUSE WITH THEM LIKE THE BUCCANEERS OF THE SPANISH MAIN THAT I'VE READ ABOUT TILL THE PLUNDER WAS ALL GONE
4821-27466-0006 AND JIM PICKED UP PART OF A WOMAN'S DRESS SPLASHED WITH BLOOD
4821-27466-0007 A LONG LOCK OF WOMAN'S HAIR FAIR BRIGHT BROWN THAT LOOKED AS IF THE NAME OF TERRIBLE HOLLOW MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THIS LONELY WONDERFUL GLEN FOR NOTHING WE SPENT NEARLY A WEEK IN THIS WAY
4821-27466-0008 AND WERE BEGINNING TO GET RATHER SICK OF THE LIFE WHEN FATHER WHO USED ALWAYS TO BE LOOKING AT A BARE PATCH IN THE SCRUB ABOVE US SAID THEY'RE COMING AT LAST WHO ARE COMING FRIENDS WHY FRIENDS OF COURSE THAT'S STARLIGHT'S SIGNAL
4821-27466-0009 SEE THAT SMOKE THE HALF CASTE ALWAYS SENDS THAT UP LIKE THE BLACKS IN HIS MOTHER'S TRIBE I SUPPOSE ANY CATTLE OR HORSES WITH THEM SAID JIM NO OR THEY'D SEND UP TWO SMOKES
4821-27466-0010 THEY'LL BE HERE ABOUT DINNER TIME SO WE MUST GET READY FOR THEM WE HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO GET OURSELVES OR ANYTHING ELSE READY IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS WE BEGAN TO LOOK AT THEM THROUGH A STRONG SPYGLASS WHICH FATHER BROUGHT OUT
4821-27466-0011 BY AND BY WE GOT SIGHT OF TWO MEN COMING ALONG ON HORSEBACK ON THE TOP OF THE RANGE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FAR WALL THEY WASN'T PARTICULARLY EASY TO SEE AND EVERY NOW AND THEN WE'D LOSE SIGHT OF EM AS THEY GOT INTO THICK TIMBER OR BEHIND ROCKS
4821-27466-0012 FATHER GOT THE SPYGLASS ON TO EM AT LAST PRETTY CLEAR AND NEARLY THREW IT DOWN WITH AN OATH
4821-27466-0013 I BELIEVE STARLIGHT'S HURT SOMEHOW HE'S SO INFERNAL RASH I CAN SEE THE HALF CASTE HOLDING HIM ON IF THE POLICE ARE ON HIS TRACKS THEY'LL SPRING THE PLANT HERE AND THE WHOLE THING'LL BE BLOWN WE SAW THEM COME TO THE TOP OF THE WALL AS IT WERE
4821-27466-0014 LET'S GO OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE SAYS FATHER THEY'RE COMING DOWN THE GULLY NOW IT'S A TERRIBLE STEEP ROUGH TRACK WORSE THAN THE OTHER IF STARLIGHT'S HURT BAD HE'LL NEVER RIDE DOWN BUT HE HAS THE PLUCK OF THE DEVIL SURE ENOUGH
4821-27466-0015 WE RODE OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE WHERE THERE WAS A KIND OF GULLY THAT CAME IN SOMETHING LIKE THE ONE WE CAME IN BY
4821-27466-0016 THERE WAS A PATH BUT IT LOOKED AS IF CATTLE COULD NEVER BE DRIVEN OR FORCED UP IT WE FOUND AFTERWARDS THAT THEY HAD AN OLD PACK BULLOCK THAT THEY'D TRAINED TO WALK UP THIS AND DOWN TOO WHEN THEY WANTED HIM AND THE OTHER CATTLE FOLLOWED IN HIS TRACK AS CATTLE WILL
4821-27466-0017 FATHER SHOWED US A SORT OF CAVE BY THE SIDE OF THE TRACK WHERE ONE MAN WITH A COUPLE OF GUNS AND A PISTOL OR TWO COULD HAVE SHOT DOWN A SMALL REGIMENT AS THEY CAME DOWN ONE AT A TIME
4821-27466-0018 WE STAYED IN THERE BY THE TRACK AND AFTER ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WE HEARD THE TWO HORSES COMING DOWN SLOWLY STEP BY STEP KICKING THE STONES DOWN BEFORE THEM THEN WE COULD HEAR A MAN GROANING AS IF HE COULDN'T BEAR THE PAIN
4821-27466-0019 AND PARTLY AS IF HE WAS TRYING TO SMOTHER IT THEN ANOTHER MAN'S VOICE VERY SOFT AND SOOTHING LIKE TRYING TO COMFORT ANOTHER
4821-27466-0020 MY HEAD'S A FIRE AND THESE CURSED RIBS ARE GRINDING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER EVERY STEP OF THIS INFERNAL LADDER IS IT FAR NOW HOW HE GROANED THEN
4821-27466-0021 JUST THEN THE LEADING HORSE CAME OUT INTO THE OPEN BEFORE THE CAVE WE HAD A GOOD LOOK AT HIM AND HIS RIDER I NEVER FORGOT THEM IT WAS A BAD DAY I EVER SAW EITHER AND MANY A MAN HAD CAUSE TO SAY THE SAME
4821-27466-0022 THE HORSE HELD UP HIS HEAD AND SNORTED AS HE CAME ABREAST OF US AND WE SHOWED OUT HE WAS ONE OF THE GRANDEST ANIMALS I'D EVER SEEN AND I AFTERWARDS FOUND HE WAS BETTER THAN HE LOOKED
4821-27466-0023 HE CAME STEPPING DOWN THAT BEASTLY ROCKY GOAT TRACK HE A CLEAN THOROUGHBRED THAT OUGHT NEVER TO HAVE TROD UPON ANYTHING ROUGHER THAN A ROLLED TRAINING TRACK OR THE SOUND BUSH TURF
4821-27466-0024 A HALF DEAD FAINTING MAN THAT COULDN'T HOLD THE REINS AND HIM WALKING DOWN AS STEADY AS AN OLD MOUNTAIN BULL OR A WALLAROO ON THE SIDE OF A CREEK BANK I HADN'T MUCH TIME TO LOOK HIM OVER
4821-27466-0025 HE WAS AS PALE AS A GHOST HIS EYES GREAT DARK ONES THEY WERE TOO WERE STARING OUT OF HIS HEAD I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD AND CALLED OUT TO FATHER AND JIM THAT HE WAS THEY RAN UP AND WE LIFTED HIM OFF AFTER UNDOING SOME STRAPS AND A ROPE
4821-27466-0026 HE WAS TIED ON THAT WAS WHAT THE HALF CASTE WAS WAITING FOR AT THE TOP OF THE GULLY WHEN WE LAID HIM DOWN HIS HEAD FELL BACK AND HE LOOKED AS MUCH LIKE A CORPSE AS IF HE HAD BEEN DEAD A DAY THEN WE SAW HE HAD BEEN WOUNDED THERE WAS BLOOD ON HIS SHIRT AND THE UPPER PART OF HIS ARM WAS BANDAGED
4821-27466-0027 IT'S TOO LATE FATHER SAID I HE'S A DEAD MAN WHAT PLUCK HE MUST HAVE HAD TO RIDE DOWN THERE HE'S WORTH TWO DEAD UNS YET SAID FATHER WHO HAD HIS HAND ON HIS PULSE HOLD HIS HEAD UP ONE OF YOU WHILE I GO FOR THE BRANDY
4821-27466-0028 A SLIGHT ACTIVE LOOKING CHAP ABOUT SIXTEEN THAT LOOKED AS IF HE COULD JUMP INTO A GUM TREE AND BACK AGAIN AND I BELIEVE HE COULD SERGEANT GORING HE VERY NEAR GRAB US AT DILLIGAH
4821-27466-0029 MY WORD HE VERY NEARLY FALL OFF JUST LIKE THAT HERE HE IMITATED A MAN REELING IN HIS SADDLE BUT THE OLD HORSE STOP STEADY WITH HIM MY WORD TILL HE COME TO THEN THE SERGEANT FIRE AT HIM AGAIN HIT HIM IN THE SHOULDER WITH HIS PISTOL
4821-27466-0030 THEN STARLIGHT COME TO HIS SENSES AND WE CLEAR MY WORD HE COULDN'T SEE THE WAY THE OLD HORSE WENT HA HA HERE THE YOUNG DEVIL LAUGHED TILL THE TREES AND ROCKS RANG AGAIN GALLOP DIFFERENT WAYS TOO AND MET AT THE OLD NEEDLE ROCK
4821-27466-0031 BUT THEY WAS MILES AWAY THEN BEFORE THE WILD BOY HAD COME TO THE END OF HIS STORY THE WOUNDED MAN HAD PROVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A DEAD FAINT AS THE WOMEN CALL IT NOT THE REAL THING
4821-27466-0032 AND AFTER HE HAD TASTED A PANNIKIN FULL OF BRANDY AND WATER WHICH FATHER BROUGHT HIM HE SAT UP AND LOOKED LIKE A LIVING MAN ONCE MORE BETTER HAVE A LOOK AT MY SHOULDER HE SAID
4821-27466-0033 I'VE HAD A SQUEAK FOR IT PUTS ME IN MIND OF OUR OLD POACHING ROWS SAID FATHER WHILE HE CAREFULLY CUT THE SHIRT OFF THAT WAS STIFFENED WITH BLOOD AND SHOWED WHERE THE BULLET HAD PASSED THROUGH THE MUSCLE NARROWLY MISSING THE BONE OF THE JOINT
4821-27466-0034 WE WASHED IT AND RELIEVED THE WOUNDED MAN BY DISCOVERING THAT THE OTHER BULLET HAD ONLY BEEN SPENT AFTER STRIKING A TREE MOST LIKE WHEN IT HAD KNOCKED THE WIND OUT OF HIM AND NEARLY UNHORSED HIM AS WARRIGAL SAID FILL MY PIPE ONE OF YOU
4821-27466-0035 WHO THE DEVIL ARE THESE LADS YOURS I SUPPOSE MARSTON OR YOU WOULDN'T BE FOOL ENOUGH TO BRING THEM HERE WHY DIDN'T YOU LEAVE THEM AT HOME WITH THEIR MOTHER DON'T YOU THINK YOU AND I AND THIS DEVIL'S LIMB ENOUGH FOR THIS PRECIOUS TRADE OF OURS
4821-27466-0036 THEY'LL TAKE THEIR LUCK AS IT COMES LIKE OTHERS GROWLED FATHER WHAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME ISN'T TOO BAD FOR THEM WE WANT ANOTHER HAND OR TWO TO WORK THINGS RIGHT
4821-27466-0037 OH WE DO DO WE SAID THE STRANGER FIXING HIS EYES ON FATHER AS IF HE WAS GOING TO BURN A HOLE IN HIM WITH A BURNING GLASS
4821-27466-0038 BUT IF I'D A BRACE OF FINE BOYS LIKE THOSE OF MY OWN I'D HANG MYSELF BEFORE I'D DRAG THEM INTO THE PIT AFTER MYSELF THAT'S ALL VERY FINE SAID FATHER LOOKING VERY DARK AND DANGEROUS
4821-27466-0039 IS MISTER STARLIGHT GOING TO TURN PARSON YOU'LL BE JUST IN TIME FOR WE'LL ALL BE SHOPPED IF YOU RUN AGAINST THE POLICE LIKE THIS AND NEXT THING TO LAY THEM ON TO THE HOLLOW BY MAKING FOR IT WHEN YOU'RE TOO WEAK TO RIDE
4821-27466-0040 WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO PULL UP AND HOLD UP MY HANDS THERE WAS NOWHERE ELSE TO GO AND THAT NEW SERGEANT RODE DEVILISH WELL I CAN TELL YOU WITH A BIG CHESTNUT WELL BRED HORSE THAT GAVE OLD RAINBOW HERE ALL HE KNEW TO LOSE HIM
4821-27466-0041 NOW ONCE FOR ALL NO MORE OF THAT MARSTON AND MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS I'M THE SUPERIOR OFFICER IN THIS SHIP'S COMPANY YOU KNOW THAT VERY WELL YOUR BUSINESS IS TO OBEY ME AND TAKE SECOND PLACE FATHER GROWLED OUT SOMETHING
4821-27466-0042 BUT DID NOT OFFER TO DENY IT WE COULD SEE PLAINLY THAT THE STRANGER WAS OR HAD BEEN FAR ABOVE OUR RANK WHATEVER WERE THE REASONS WHICH HAD LED TO HIS PRESENT KIND OF LIFE
4821-27466-0043 HE WAS PLEASANT ENOUGH TOO WHEN THE PAIN WENT AWAY HE HAD BEEN IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND TOLD US ALL KINDS OF STORIES ABOUT THEM HE SAID NOTHING THOUGH ABOUT HIS OWN FORMER WAYS AND WE OFTEN WONDERED WHATEVER COULD HAVE MADE HIM TAKE TO SUCH A LIFE
4821-27466-0044 UNKNOWN TO FATHER TOO HE GAVE US GOOD ADVICE WARNED US THAT WHAT WE WERE IN WAS THE ROAD TO IMPRISONMENT OR DEATH IN DUE COURSE AND NOT TO FLATTER OURSELVES THAT ANY OTHER ENDING WAS POSSIBLE
4821-27466-0045 I HAVE MY OWN REASONS FOR LEADING THE LIFE I DO HE SAID AND MUST RUN MY OWN COURSE OF WHICH I FORESEE THE END AS PLAINLY AS IF IT WAS WRITTEN IN A BOOK BEFORE ME YOUR FATHER HAD A LONG ACCOUNT TO SQUARE WITH SOCIETY
4821-27466-0046 AND HE HAS A RIGHT TO SETTLE IT HIS OWN WAY THAT YELLOW WHELP WAS NEVER INTENDED FOR ANYTHING BETTER BUT FOR YOU LADS'
4821-27466-0047 AND NEVER COME BACK HERE AGAIN TELL YOUR FATHER YOU WON'T COME CUT LOOSE FROM HIM ONCE AND FOR ALL YOU'D BETTER DROWN YOURSELVES COMFORTABLY AT ONCE THAN TAKE TO THIS CURSED TRADE NOW MIND WHAT I TELL YOU AND KEEP YOUR OWN COUNSEL
4821-27466-0048 BY AND BY THE DAY CAME WHEN THE HORSES WERE RUN IN FOR FATHER AND MISTER STARLIGHT AND WARRIGAL WHO PACKED UP TO BE OFF FOR SOME OTHER PART WHEN THEY WERE IN THE YARD WE HAD A GOOD LOOK AT HIS OWN HORSE
4821-27466-0049 A GOOD LOOK AND IF I'D BEEN A FELLOW THAT PAINTED PICTURES AND THAT KIND OF THING I COULD DRAW A MIDDLIN GOOD LIKENESS OF HIM NOW BY GEORGE HOW FOND I AM OF A GOOD HORSE A REAL WELL BRED CLINKER
4821-27466-0050 AND MANY ANOTHER CURRENCY CHAP CAN SAY THE SAME
4821-27466-0051 THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF IT ONE OR T'OTHER GENERALLY FETCHES US I SHALL NEVER PUT FOOT IN STIRRUP AGAIN BUT I'LL TRY AND SCRATCH OUT A SORT OF LIKENESS OF RAINBOW HE WAS A DARK BAY HORSE NEARLY BROWN WITHOUT A WHITE HAIR ON HIM
4821-27466-0052 HE WASN'T ABOVE FIFTEEN HANDS AND AN INCH HIGH BUT LOOKED A DEAL BIGGER THAN HE WAS FOR THE WAY HE HELD HIS HEAD UP AND CARRIED HIMSELF HE WAS DEEP AND THICK THROUGH BEHIND THE SHOULDERS AND GIRTHED EVER SO MUCH MORE THAN YOU'D THINK
4821-27466-0053 HE HAD A SHORT BACK AND HIS RIBS WENT OUT LIKE A CASK LONG QUARTER GREAT THIGHS AND HOCKS WONDERFUL LEGS AND FEET OF COURSE TO DO THE WORK HE DID HIS HEAD WAS PLAINISH BUT CLEAN AND BONY AND HIS EYE WAS BIG AND WELL OPENED WITH NO WHITE SHOWING
4821-27466-0054 HIS SHOULDER WAS SLOPED BACK THAT MUCH THAT HE COULDN'T FALL NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED HIS FORE LEGS ALL HIS PACES WERE GOOD TOO I BELIEVE HE COULD JUMP JUMP ANYTHING HE WAS RIDDEN AT AND VERY FEW HORSES COULD GET THE BETTER OF HIM FOR ONE MILE OR THREE
4821-27466-0055 WHERE HE'D COME FROM OF COURSE WE WERE NOT TO KNOW THEN HE HAD A SMALL PRIVATE SORT OF BRAND THAT DIDN'T BELONG TO ANY OF THE BIG STUDS BUT HE WAS NEVER BRED BY A POOR MAN
4821-27466-0056 AND HIS DAM KILLED AS SOON AS SHE HAD WEANED HIM SO OF COURSE NO ONE COULD SWEAR TO HIM AND STARLIGHT COULD HAVE RIDDEN PAST THE SUPREME COURT AT THE ASSIZES AND NEVER BEEN STOPPED AS FAR AS THIS HORSE WAS CONCERNED
4821-27466-0057 BEFORE WE WENT AWAY FATHER AND STARLIGHT HAD SOME TERRIBLE LONG TALKS AND ONE EVENING JIM CAME TO ME AND SAYS HE WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE UP TO NOW HOW SHOULD I KNOW STICKING UP A BANK OR BONING A FLOCK OF MAIDEN EWES TO TAKE UP A RUN WITH
4821-27466-0058 THEY SEEM TO BE GAME FOR ANYTHING THERE'LL BE A HANGING MATCH IN THE FAMILY IF US BOYS DON'T LOOK OUT THERE'S NO KNOWING SAYS JIM WITH A ROGUISH LOOK IN HIS EYE I DIDN'T THINK THEN HOW NEAR THE TRUTH I WAS BUT IT'S ABOUT A HORSE THIS TIME
4821-27466-0059 BUT WHAT'S ONE HORSE TO MAKE SUCH A SHINE ABOUT AH THAT'S THE POINT SAYS POOR OLD JIM IT'S A HORSE WORTH TALKING ABOUT
4821-27466-0060 HIM THAT MISTER WINDHALL GAVE TWO THOUSAND POUNDS FOR WHAT THE MARQUIS OF LORNE WHY YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY THEY'RE GOING FOR HIM BY GEORGE I DO SAYS JIM
4821-27466-0061 AND THEY'LL HAVE HIM HERE AND TWENTY BLOOD MARES TO PUT TO HIM BEFORE SEPTEMBER THEY'RE ALL GONE MAD THEY'LL RAISE THE COUNTRY ON US EVERY POLICE TROOPER IN THE COLONY'LL BE AFTER US LIKE A PACK OF DINGOES AFTER AN OLD MAN KANGAROO WHEN THE GROUND'S BOGGY
4821-27466-0062 AND THEY'LL RUN US DOWN TOO THEY CAN'T BE OFF IT WHATEVER MADE EM THINK OF SUCH A BIG TOUCH AS THAT THAT STARLIGHT'S THE DEVIL I THINK SAID JIM SLOWLY FATHER DIDN'T SEEM TO LIKE IT AT FIRST
4821-27466-0063 BUT HE BROUGHT HIM ROUND BIT BY BIT SAID HE KNEW A SQUATTER IN QUEENSLAND HE COULD PASS HIM ON TO
4821-27466-0064 AND WHEN THE DERRY WAS OFF HE'D TAKE HIM OVER HIMSELF BUT HOW'S HE GOING TO NAIL HIM PEOPLE SAY WINDHALL KEEPS HIM LOCKED UP AT NIGHT AND HIS BOX IS CLOSE TO HIS HOUSE STARLIGHT SAYS HE HAS A FRIEND HANDY
4821-27466-0065 HE SEEMS TO HAVE ONE OR TWO EVERYWHERE IT'S WONDERFUL
4821-27466-0066 BY GEORGE IT WOULD BE A TOUCH AND NO MISTAKE
4821-27466-0067 IT DID SEEM A GRAND SORT OF THING YOUNG FOOLS THAT WE WERE
4821-27466-0068 GOOD AS ANYTHING ENGLAND COULD TURN OUT I SAY AGAIN IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE HORSE FLESH PART OF IT THE FUN AND HARD RIDING AND TRACKING AND ALL THE REST OF IT THERE WOULDN'T BE ANYTHING LIKE THE CROSS WORK THAT THERE IS IN AUSTRALIA IT LIES PARTLY BETWEEN THAT AND THE DRY WEATHER
4821-27466-0069 THERE'S THE LONG SPELLS OF DROUGHT WHEN NOTHING CAN BE DONE BY YOUNG OR OLD SOMETIMES FOR MONTHS YOU CAN'T WORK IN THE GARDEN NOR PLOUGH NOR SOW
4821-27466-0070 ONLY SIT AT HOME AND DO NOTHING OR ELSE GO OUT AND WATCH THE GRASS WITHERIN AND THE WATER DRYIN UP AND THE STOCK DYIN BY INCHES BEFORE YOUR EYES AND NO CHANGE MAYBE FOR MONTHS THE GROUND LIKE IRON AND THE SKY LIKE BRASS AS THE PARSON SAID
4821-27466-0071 AND VERY TRUE TOO LAST SUNDAY THEN THE YOUNGSTERS HAVIN SO MUCH IDLE TIME ON THEIR HANDS TAKE TO GAFFIN AND FLASH TALK AND MONEY MUST BE GOT TO SPORT AND PAY UP IF THEY LOSE AND THE STOCK ALL RAMBLIN ABOUT AND MIXED UP
4821-27466-0072 LIKE WE DID THAT FIRST RED HEIFER I SHALL REMEMBER HER TO MY DYING DAY IT SEEMS AS IF I HAD PUT THAT BRAND ON MY OWN HEART WHEN I JAMMED IT DOWN ON HER SOFT SKIN ANYHOW I NEVER FORGOT IT AND THERE'S MANY ANOTHER LIKE ME I'LL BE BOUND
4821-27466-0073 THE NEXT MORNING JIM AND I STARTED OFF HOME FATHER SAID HE SHOULD STAY IN THE HOLLOW TILL STARLIGHT GOT ROUND A BIT HE TOLD US NOT TO TELL MOTHER OR AILIE A WORD ABOUT WHERE WE'D BEEN OF COURSE THEY COULDN'T BE OFF KNOWIN THAT WE'D BEEN WITH HIM
4821-27466-0074 BUT WE WERE TO STALL THEM OFF BY SAYING WE'D BEEN HELPING HIM WITH A BIT OF BUSH WORK OR ANYTHING WE COULD THINK OFF IT'LL DO NO GOOD AND YOUR MOTHER'S QUITE MISERABLE ENOUGH AS IT IS BOYS HE SAID SHE'LL KNOW TIME ENOUGH AND MAYBE BREAK HER HEART OVER IT TOO POOR NORAH
4821-27466-0075 DASHED IF I EVER HEARD FATHER SAY A SOFT THING BEFORE I COULDN'T A BELIEVED IT I ALWAYS THOUGHT HE WAS IRONBARK OUTSIDE AND IN BUT HE SEEMED REAL SORRY FOR ONCE AND I WAS NEAR SAYIN
4821-27466-0076 BUT WHEN I LOOKED AGAIN HIS FACE WAS ALL CHANGED AND HARD LIKE OFF YOU GO HE SAYS WITH HIS OLD VOICE NEXT TIME I WANT EITHER OF YOU I'LL SEND WARRIGAL FOR YOU
4821-27466-0077 AND WITH THAT HE WALKED OFF FROM THE YARD WHERE WE HAD BEEN CATCHING OUR HORSES AND NEVER LOOKED NIGH US AGAIN WE RODE AWAY TO THE LOW END OF THE GULLY AND THEN WE LED THE HORSES UP FOOT BY FOOT AND HARD WORK IT WAS LIKE CLIMBING UP THE ROOF OF A HOUSE
4821-27466-0078 WE MADE OUR WAY TO THE YARD WHERE THERE WERE THE TRACKS OF THE COWS ALL ROUND ABOUT IT BUT NOTHING BUT THE WILD HORSES HAD EVER BEEN THERE SINCE WHAT A SCRUBBY HOLE IT IS SAID JIM I WONDER HOW IN THE WORLD THEY EVER FOUND OUT THE WAY TO THE HOLLOW
4821-27466-0079 SOME RUNAWAY GOVERNMENT MEN I BELIEVE SO THAT HALF CASTE CHAP TOLD ME AND A GIN SHOWED EM THE TRACK DOWN AND WHERE TO GET WATER AND EVERYTHING THEY LIVED ON KANGAROOS AT FIRST
4821-27466-0080 THEN BY DEGREES THEY USED TO CRAWL OUT BY MOONLIGHT AND COLLAR A HORSE OR TWO OR A FEW CATTLE THEY MANAGED TO LIVE THERE YEARS AND YEARS ONE DIED ONE WAS KILLED BY THE BLACKS THE LAST MAN SHOWED IT TO THE CHAPS THAT PASSED IT ON TO STARLIGHT
