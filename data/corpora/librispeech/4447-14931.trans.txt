4447-14931-0000 THE BREED OF TERRIER NOW KNOWN AS THE DANDIE DINMONT IS ONE OF THE RACES OF THE DOG WHICH CAN BOAST OF A FAIRLY ANCIENT LINEAGE
4447-14931-0001 THOUGH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE NOW TO SAY WHAT WAS THE EXACT ORIGIN OF THIS BREED WE KNOW THAT IT WAS FIRST RECOGNISED UNDER ITS PRESENT NAME AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF SCOTT'S GUY MANNERING IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN
4447-14931-0002 AND WE KNOW THAT FOR MANY YEARS PREVIOUSLY THERE HAD EXISTED IN THE BORDER COUNTIES A ROUGH HAIRED SHORT LEGGED RACE OF TERRIER THE CONSTANT AND VERY EFFECTIVE COMPANION OF THE BORDER FARMERS AND OTHERS IN THEIR FOX HUNTING EXPEDITIONS
4447-14931-0003 VARIOUS THEORIES HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED BY DIFFERENT WRITERS AS TO THE MANNER IN WHICH THE BREED WAS FOUNDED SOME SAY THAT THE DANDIE IS THE RESULT OF CROSSING A STRAIN OF ROUGH HAIRED TERRIERS WITH THE DACHSHUND OTHERS THAT A ROUGH HAIRED TERRIER WAS CROSSED WITH THE OTTERHOUND
4447-14931-0004 AND OTHERS AGAIN ASSERT THAT NO DIRECT CROSS WAS EVER INTRODUCED TO FOUND THE BREED BUT THAT IT WAS GRADUALLY EVOLVED FROM THE ROUGH HAIRED TERRIERS OF THE BORDER DISTRICT AND THIS LATTER THEORY IS PROBABLY CORRECT
4447-14931-0005 THE DANDIE WOULD APPEAR TO BE CLOSELY RELATED TO THE BEDLINGTON TERRIER IN BOTH BREEDS WE FIND THE SAME INDOMITABLE PLUCK THE SAME PENDULOUS EAR AND A LIGHT SILKY TOPKNOT ADORNING THE SKULL OF EACH
4447-14931-0006 A CASE IS QUOTED OF THE LATE LORD ANTRIM WHO IN THE EARLY DAYS OF DOG SHOWS EXHIBITED TWO ANIMALS FROM THE SAME LITTER AND WITH THE ONE OBTAINED A PRIZE OR HONOURABLE MENTION IN THE DANDIE CLASSES AND WITH THE OTHER A LIKE DISTINCTION IN THE BEDLINGTON CLASSES
4447-14931-0007 IT MAY BE INTERESTING TO GIVE A FEW PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE TRACEABLE ANCESTORS OF THE MODERN DANDIE IN MISTER CHARLES COOK'S BOOK ON THIS BREED WE ARE GIVEN PARTICULARS OF ONE WILLIAM ALLAN OF HOLYSTONE BORN IN SEVENTEEN O FOUR
4447-14931-0008 AND KNOWN AS PIPER ALLAN AND CELEBRATED AS A HUNTER OF OTTERS AND FOXES AND FOR HIS STRAIN OF ROUGH HAIRED TERRIERS WHO SO ABLY ASSISTED HIM IN THE CHASE WILLIAM ALLAN'S TERRIERS DESCENDED TO HIS SON JAMES ALSO KNOWN AS THE PIPER
4447-14931-0009 AND BORN IN THE YEAR SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR JAMES ALLAN DIED IN EIGHTEEN TEN AND WAS SURVIVED BY A SON WHO SOLD TO MISTER FRANCIS SOMNER AT YETHOLM A TERRIER DOG NAMED OLD PEPPER DESCENDED FROM HIS GRANDFATHER'S FAMOUS DOG HITCHEM
4447-14931-0010 OLD PEPPER WAS THE GREAT GRANDSIRE OF MISTER SOMNER'S WELL KNOWN DOG SHEM THESE TERRIERS BELONGING TO THE ALLANS AND OTHERS IN THE DISTRICT ARE CONSIDERED BY MISTER COOK TO BE THE EARLIEST KNOWN ANCESTORS OF THE MODERN DANDIE DINMONT
4447-14931-0011 SIR WALTER SCOTT HIMSELF INFORMS US THAT HE DID NOT DRAW THE CHARACTER OF DANDIE DINMONT FROM ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL IN PARTICULAR BUT THAT THE CHARACTER WOULD WELL FIT A DOZEN OR MORE OF THE LIDDERDALE YEOMEN OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE
4447-14931-0012 HOWEVER OWING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF HIS CALLING ALL HIS TERRIERS MUSTARD AND PEPPER WITHOUT ANY OTHER DISTINCTION EXCEPT AULD AND YOUNG AND LITTLE THE NAME CAME TO BE FIXED BY HIS ASSOCIATES UPON ONE JAMES DAVIDSON OF HINDLEE
4447-14931-0013 A WILD FARM IN THE TEVIOTDALE MOUNTAINS
4447-14931-0014 JAMES DAVIDSON DIED IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY BY WHICH TIME THE DANDIE DINMONT TERRIER WAS BEING BRED IN CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS BY THE BORDER FARMERS AND OTHERS TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR IT WHICH HAD SPRUNG UP SINCE THE APPEARANCE OF GUY MANNERING
4447-14931-0015 AS A RESULT OF THE CONTROVERSIES THAT WERE CONTINUALLY RECURRING WITH REGARD TO THE POINTS OF A TYPICAL DANDIE DINMONT THERE WAS FORMED IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX THE DANDIE DINMONT TERRIER CLUB WITH THE OBJECT OF SETTLING THE QUESTION FOR EVER
4447-14931-0016 AND FOR THIS PURPOSE ALL THE MOST NOTED BREEDERS AND OTHERS INTERESTED WERE INVITED TO GIVE THEIR VIEWS UPON IT
4447-14931-0017 HEAD STRONGLY MADE AND LARGE NOT OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE DOG'S SIZE THE MUSCLES SHOWING EXTRAORDINARY DEVELOPMENT MORE ESPECIALLY THE MAXILLARY SKULL
4447-14931-0018 BROAD BETWEEN THE EARS GETTING GRADUALLY LESS TOWARDS THE EYES AND MEASURING ABOUT THE SAME FROM THE INNER CORNER OF THE EYES TO BACK OF SKULL AS IT DOES FROM EAR TO EAR THE FOREHEAD WELL DOMED
4447-14931-0019 THE HEAD IS COVERED WITH VERY SOFT SILKY HAIR WHICH SHOULD NOT BE CONFINED TO A MERE TOPKNOT AND THE LIGHTER IN COLOUR AND SILKIER IT IS THE BETTER THE CHEEKS STARTING FROM THE EARS PROPORTIONATELY WITH THE SKULL
4447-14931-0020 HAVE A GRADUAL TAPER TOWARDS THE MUZZLE WHICH IS DEEP AND STRONGLY MADE AND MEASURES ABOUT THREE INCHES IN LENGTH OR IN PROPORTION TO SKULL AS THREE IS TO FIVE THE MUZZLE IS COVERED WITH HAIR OF A LITTLE DARKER SHADE THAN THE TOPKNOT
4447-14931-0021 AND OF THE SAME TEXTURE AS THE FEATHER OF THE FORE LEGS THE TOP OF THE MUZZLE IS GENERALLY BARE FOR ABOUT AN INCH FROM THE BLACK PART OF THE NOSE THE BARENESS COMING TO A POINT TOWARDS THE EYE AND BEING ABOUT ONE INCH BROAD AT THE NOSE
4447-14931-0022 THE NOSE AND INSIDE OF MOUTH BLACK OR DARK COLOURED THE TEETH VERY STRONG ESPECIALLY THE CANINE WHICH ARE OF EXTRAORDINARY SIZE FOR SUCH A SMALL DOG THE CANINES FIT WELL INTO EACH OTHER SO AS TO GIVE THE GREATEST AVAILABLE HOLDING AND PUNISHING POWER
4447-14931-0023 AND THE TEETH ARE LEVEL IN FRONT THE UPPER ONES VERY SLIGHTLY OVERLAPPING THE UNDER ONES MANY OF THE FINEST SPECIMENS HAVE A SWINE MOUTH WHICH IS VERY OBJECTIONABLE BUT IT IS NOT SO GREAT AN OBJECTION AS THE PROTRUSION OF THE UNDER JAW
4447-14931-0024 EYES SET WIDE APART LARGE FULL ROUND BRIGHT EXPRESSIVE OF GREAT DETERMINATION INTELLIGENCE AND DIGNITY SET LOW AND PROMINENT IN FRONT OF THE HEAD COLOUR A RICH DARK HAZEL
4447-14931-0025 EARS PENDULOUS SET WELL BACK WIDE APART AND LOW ON THE SKULL HANGING CLOSE TO THE CHEEK WITH A VERY SLIGHT PROJECTION AT THE BASE BROAD AT THE JUNCTION OF THE HEAD AND TAPERING ALMOST TO A POINT
4447-14931-0026 THE FORE PART OF THE EAR TAPERING VERY LITTLE THE TAPERING BEING MOSTLY ON THE BACK PART THE FORE PART OF THE EAR COMING ALMOST STRAIGHT DOWN FROM ITS JUNCTION WITH THE HEAD TO THE TIP THEY SHOULD HARMONISE IN COLOUR WITH THE BODY COLOUR
4447-14931-0027 IN THE CASE OF A PEPPER DOG THEY ARE COVERED WITH A SOFT STRAIGHT BROWNISH HAIR IN SOME CASES ALMOST BLACK IN THE CASE OF A MUSTARD DOG THE HAIR SHOULD BE MUSTARD IN COLOUR A SHADE DARKER THAN THE BODY BUT NOT BLACK
4447-14931-0028 ALL SHOULD HAVE A THIN FEATHER OF LIGHT HAIR STARTING ABOUT TWO INCHES FROM THE TIP AND OF NEARLY THE SAME COLOUR AND TEXTURE AS THE TOPKNOT WHICH GIVES THE EAR THE APPEARANCE OF A DISTINCT POINT THE ANIMAL IS OFTEN ONE OR TWO YEARS OLD BEFORE THE FEATHER IS SHOWN
4447-14931-0029 THE CARTILAGE AND SKIN OF THE EAR SHOULD NOT BE THICK BUT RATHER THIN LENGTH OF EAR FROM THREE TO FOUR INCHES NECK VERY MUSCULAR WELL DEVELOPED AND STRONG
4447-14931-0030 SHOWING GREAT POWER OF RESISTANCE BEING WELL SET INTO THE SHOULDERS BODY LONG STRONG AND FLEXIBLE RIBS WELL SPRUNG AND ROUND CHEST WELL DEVELOPED AND LET WELL DOWN BETWEEN THE FORE LEGS
4447-14931-0031 FROM TOP OF LOINS TO ROOT OF TAIL BOTH SIDES OF BACKBONE WELL SUPPLIED WITH MUSCLE TAIL
4447-14931-0032 WITH A NICE FEATHER ABOUT TWO INCHES LONG GETTING SHORTER AS IT NEARS THE TIP RATHER THICK AT THE ROOT GETTING THICKER FOR ABOUT FOUR INCHES THEN TAPERING OFF TO A POINT
4447-14931-0033 IT SHOULD NOT BE TWISTED OR CURLED IN ANY WAY BUT SHOULD COME UP WITH A CURVE LIKE A SCIMITAR THE TIP WHEN EXCITED BEING IN A PERPENDICULAR LINE WITH THE ROOT OF THE TAIL IT SHOULD NEITHER BE SET ON TOO HIGH NOR TOO LOW
4447-14931-0034 WHEN NOT EXCITED IT IS CARRIED GAILY AND A LITTLE ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE BODY LEGS THE FORE LEGS SHORT WITH IMMENSE MUSCULAR DEVELOPMENT AND BONE SET WIDE APART THE CHEST COMING WELL DOWN BETWEEN THEM
4447-14931-0035 THE FEET WELL FORMED AND NOT FLAT WITH VERY STRONG BROWN OR DARK COLOURED CLAWS BANDY LEGS AND FLAT FEET ARE OBJECTIONABLE THE HAIR ON THE FORE LEGS AND FEET OF A PEPPER DOG SHOULD BE TAN
4447-14931-0036 OF A MUSTARD DOG THEY ARE OF A DARKER SHADE THAN ITS HEAD WHICH IS A CREAMY WHITE IN BOTH COLOURS THERE IS A NICE FEATHER ABOUT TWO INCHES LONG RATHER LIGHTER IN COLOUR THAN THE HAIR ON THE FORE PART OF THE LEG
4447-14931-0037 THE HIND LEGS ARE A LITTLE LONGER THAN THE FORE ONES AND ARE SET RATHER WIDE APART BUT NOT SPREAD OUT IN AN UNNATURAL MANNER WHILE THE FEET ARE MUCH SMALLER THE THIGHS ARE WELL DEVELOPED AND THE HAIR OF THE SAME COLOUR AND TEXTURE AS THE FORE ONES
4447-14931-0038 BUT HAVING NO FEATHER OR DEW CLAWS THE WHOLE CLAWS SHOULD BE DARK BUT THE CLAWS OF ALL VARY IN SHADE ACCORDING TO THE COLOUR OF THE DOG'S BODY COAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT
4447-14931-0039 THE HAIR ON THE UNDER PART OF THE BODY IS LIGHTER IN COLOUR AND SOFTER THAN THAT ON THE TOP
4447-14931-0040 COLOUR THE COLOUR IS PEPPER OR MUSTARD THE PEPPER RANGES FROM A DARK BLUISH BLACK TO A LIGHT SILVER GREY THE INTERMEDIATE SHADES BEING PREFERRED
4447-14931-0041 THE BODY COLOUR COMING WELL DOWN THE SHOULDER AND HIPS GRADUALLY MERGING INTO THE LEG COLOUR THE MUSTARDS VARY FROM A REDDISH BROWN TO A PALE FAWN THE HEAD BEING A CREAMY WHITE THE LEGS AND FEET OF A SHADE DARKER THAN THE HEAD
4447-14931-0042 THE CLAWS ARE DARK AS IN OTHER COLOURS NEARLY ALL DANDIE DINMONTS HAVE SOME WHITE ON THE CHEST AND SOME HAVE ALSO WHITE CLAWS SIZE THE HEIGHT SHOULD BE FROM EIGHT TO ELEVEN INCHES AT THE TOP OF SHOULDER
4447-14931-0043 LENGTH FROM TOP OF SHOULDER TO ROOT OF TAIL SHOULD NOT BE MORE THAN TWICE THE DOG'S HEIGHT BUT PREFERABLY ONE OR TWO INCHES LESS WEIGHT FROM FOURTEEN POUNDS TO TWENTY FOUR POUNDS THE BEST WEIGHT AS NEAR EIGHTEEN POUNDS AS POSSIBLE
4447-14931-0044 THESE WEIGHTS ARE FOR DOGS IN GOOD WORKING ORDER IN THE ABOVE STANDARD OF POINTS WE HAVE A VERY FULL AND DETAILED ACCOUNT OF WHAT A DANDIE SHOULD BE LIKE AND IF ONLY JUDGES AT SHOWS WOULD BEAR THEM IN MIND A LITTLE MORE WE SHOULD HAVE FEWER CONFLICTING DECISIONS GIVEN
4447-14931-0045 AND DANDIE FANCIERS AND THE PUBLIC GENERALLY WOULD NOT FROM TIME TO TIME BE SET WONDERING AS TO WHAT IS THE CORRECT TYPE OF THE BREED A DANDIE MAKES AN EXCELLENT HOUSE GUARD
4447-14931-0046 FOR SUCH A SMALL DOG HE HAS AN AMAZINGLY DEEP LOUD BARK SO THAT THE STRANGER WHO HAS HEARD HIM BARKING ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE DOOR IS QUITE ASTONISHED WHEN HE SEES THE SMALL OWNER OF THE BIG VOICE
4447-14931-0047 WHEN KEPT AS A COMPANION HE BECOMES A MOST DEVOTED AND AFFECTIONATE LITTLE FRIEND AND IS VERY INTELLIGENT AS A DOG TO BE KEPT IN KENNELS THERE IS CERTAINLY ONE GREAT DRAWBACK WHERE LARGE KENNELS ARE DESIRED
4447-14931-0048 AND THAT IS THE RISK OF KEEPING TWO OR MORE DOGS IN ONE KENNEL SOONER OR LATER THERE IS SURE TO BE A FIGHT AND WHEN DANDIES FIGHT IT IS GENERALLY A VERY SERIOUS MATTER
4447-14931-0049 IF NO ONE IS PRESENT TO SEPARATE THEM ONE OR BOTH OF THE COMBATANTS IS PRETTY CERTAIN TO BE KILLED BUT WHEN OUT WALKING THE DANDIE IS NO MORE QUARRELSOME THAN OTHER BREEDS OF TERRIERS IF PROPERLY TRAINED FROM PUPPYHOOD
4447-14931-0050 THERE IS ONE LITTLE MATTER IN BREEDING DANDIES THAT IS GENERALLY A SURPRISE TO THE NOVICE AND THAT IS THE VERY GREAT DIFFERENCE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE YOUNG PUPS AND THE ADULT DOG THE PUPS ARE BORN QUITE SMOOTH HAIRED
4447-14931-0051 THE PEPPERS ARE BLACK AND TAN IN COLOUR AND THE MUSTARDS HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF BLACK IN THEIR COLOURING THE TOPKNOT BEGINS TO APPEAR SOMETIMES WHEN THE DOG IS A FEW MONTHS OLD AND SOMETIMES NOT TILL HE IS A YEAR OR SO OLD
4447-14931-0052 IT IS GENERALLY BEST TO MATE A MUSTARD TO A PEPPER TO PREVENT THE MUSTARDS BECOMING TOO LIGHT IN COLOUR THOUGH TWO RICH COLOURED MUSTARDS MAY BE MATED TOGETHER WITH GOOD RESULTS
