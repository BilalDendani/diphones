3845-181096-0000 CHAPTER FIVE DISJOINTED SKETCHES AND GRUMBLES IT WAS MY DUTY TO RARE THE PODDIES
3845-181096-0001 I DID A GREAT AMOUNT OF THINKING WHILE FEEDING THEM FOR BY THE WAY I AM AFFLICTED WITH THE POWER OF THOUGHT WHICH IS A HEAVY CURSE
3845-181096-0002 WHEN DRAGGING ALONG THROUGH LIFE THE HAPPIER IT IS FOR HIM AND DOUBLY TREBLY SO FOR HER POOR LITTLE CALVES SLAVES TO THE GREED OF MAN
3845-181096-0003 AND COMPELLED TO EXIST ON MILK FROM THE SEPARATOR OFTEN THICK SOUR AND ICY COLD BESIDES THE MILKING I DID
3845-181096-0004 I HAD TO FEED THIRTY CALVES AND WASH THE BREAKFAST DISHES ON RETURNING FROM SCHOOL IN THE AFTERNOON
3845-181096-0005 I HAD THE SAME DUTIES OVER AGAIN AND IN ADDITION BOOTS TO CLEAN AND HOME LESSONS TO PREPARE FOR THE MORROW I HAD TO RELINQUISH MY PIANO PRACTICE FOR WANT OF TIME AH THOSE SHORT SHORT NIGHTS OF REST AND LONG LONG DAYS OF TOIL
3845-181096-0006 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT DAIRYING MEANS SLAVERY IN THE HANDS OF POOR PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD HIRED LABOUR I AM NOT WRITING OF DAIRY FARMING THE GENTEEL AND ARTISTIC PROFESSION AS EULOGIZED IN LEADING ARTICLES OF AGRICULTURAL NEWSPAPERS
3845-181096-0007 AND AS TAUGHT IN AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES I AM DEPICTING PRACTICAL DAIRYING AS I HAVE LIVED IT AND SEEN IT LIVED BY DOZENS OF FAMILIES AROUND ME
3845-181096-0008 SO IT WAS MUCH WORK AND SMALL PAY
3845-181096-0009 HARD GRAFT IS A GREAT LEVELLER HOUSEHOLD DRUDGERY WOODCUTTING MILKING AND GARDENING SOON ROUGHEN THE HANDS AND DIM THE OUTSIDE POLISH WHEN THE BODY IS WEARIED WITH MUCH TOIL THE DESIRE TO CULTIVATE THE MIND
3845-181096-0010 AUSTRALIA'S DEMOCRACY IS ONLY A TRADITION OF THE PAST I SAY NAUGHT AGAINST THE LOWER LIFE THE PEASANTRY ARE THE BULWARKS OF EVERY NATION
3845-181096-0011 WHEN TIMES ARE GOOD AND WHEN SEASONS SMILE A GRAND LIFE IT IS HONEST CLEAN AND WHOLESOME
3845-181096-0012 I BORROWED EVERY BOOK IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND STOLE HOURS FROM REST TO READ THEM THIS TOLD UPON ME AND MADE MY PHYSICAL BURDENS HARDER FOR ME THAN FOR OTHER CHILDREN OF MY YEARS AROUND ME THAT THIRD WAS THE STRONGEST PART OF ME IN IT I LIVED A DREAM LIFE WITH WRITERS ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS
3845-181096-0013 HOPE SWEET CRUEL DELUSIVE HOPE WHISPERED IN MY EAR THAT LIFE WAS LONG WITH MUCH BY AND BY AND IN THAT BY AND BY MY DREAM LIFE WOULD BE REAL SO ON I WENT WITH THAT GLEAMING LAKE IN THE DISTANCE BECKONING ME TO COME AND SAIL ON ITS SILVER WATERS
3845-181096-0014 THE SCORCHING FURNACE BREATH WINDS SHRIVELLED EVERY BLADE OF GRASS DUST AND THE MOAN OF STARVING STOCK FILLED THE AIR VEGETABLES BECAME A THING OF THE PAST THE CALVES I HAD REARED DIED ONE BY ONE AND THE COWS FOLLOWED IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS
3845-181096-0015 WHEN OUR STRENGTH PROVED INADEQUATE
3845-181096-0016 ONLY A FEW OF OUR MORE WELL TO DO NEIGHBOURS HAD BEEN ABLE TO SEND THEIR STOCK AWAY
3845-181096-0017 THIS COW LIFTING BECAME QUITE A TRADE THE WHOLE DAY BEING SPENT IN IT AND IN DISCUSSING THE BAD PROSPECT AHEAD IF THE DROUGHT CONTINUED MANY AN EXTRA LINE OF CARE FURROWED THE BROWS OF THE DISHEARTENED BUSHMEN THEN
3845-181096-0018 NOT ONLY WAS THEIR LIVING TAKEN FROM THEM BY THE DROUGHT BUT THERE IS NOTHING MORE HEARTRENDING THAN TO HAVE POOR BEASTS ESPECIALLY DAIRY COWS SO FAMILIAR VALUED AND LOVED PLEADING FOR FOOD DAY AFTER DAY IN THEIR PITEOUS DUMB WAY WHEN ONE HAS IT NOT TO GIVE
3845-181096-0019 WE SHORE OURSELVES OF ALL BUT THE BARE NECESSARIES OF LIFE BUT EVEN THEY FOR A FAMILY OF TEN ARE CONSIDERABLE AND IT WAS A MIGHTY TUSSLE TO GET BOTH ENDS WITHIN COVER OF MEETING WE FELT THE FULL FORCE OF THE HEAVY HAND OF POVERTY
3845-181096-0020 THE MOST STINGING KIND OF POVERTY TOO THAT WHICH STILL HOLDS UP ITS HEAD AND KEEPS AN OUTSIDE APPEARANCE FAR MORE GRINDING IS THIS THAN THE POVERTY INHERITED FROM GENERATIONS WHICH IS NOT ASHAMED OF ITSELF
3845-181096-0021 SOME THERE ARE WHO ARGUE THAT POVERTY DOES NOT MEAN UNHAPPINESS LET THOSE TRY WHAT IT IS TO BE DESTITUTE OF EVEN ONE COMPANIONABLE FRIEND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE FORCED TO EXIST IN AN ALIEN SPHERE OF SOCIETY
3845-181096-0022 LET THEM LONG AS PASSIONATELY AS I HAVE LONGED FOR READING AND MUSIC AND BE UNABLE TO PROCURE IT BECAUSE OF POVERTY LET POVERTY FORCE THEM INTO DOING WORK AGAINST WHICH EVERY FIBRE OF THEIR BEING REVOLTS AS IT HAS FORCED ME AND THEN SEE IF THEIR LIVES WILL BE HAPPY
3845-181096-0023 MY SCHOOL LIFE HAD BEEN DULL AND UNEVENTFUL
3845-181096-0024 STOOD UP TO THE INSPECTOR THE LATTER WAS A PRECISE COLLAR AND CUFFS SORT OF LITTLE MAN
3845-181096-0025 AND NEATLY LABELLED SO THAT HE MIGHT WITHOUT FLUSTER POUNCE UPON ANY OF THEM AT A MOMENT'S WARNING HE WAS GENTLEMANLY AND RESPECTABLE AND DISCHARGED HIS DUTIES PUNCTILIOUSLY IN A MANNER REFLECTING CREDIT ON HIMSELF AND HIS POSITION
3845-181096-0026 AND WAS LOOKING AT OUR COPY BOOKS HE LOOKED UP FROM THEM AHEMED AND FASTIDIOUSLY STRAIGHTENED HIS WAISTCOAT MISTER HARRIS YES SIR COMPARISONS ARE ODIOUS BUT UNFORTUNATELY I AM FORCED TO DRAW ONE NOW YES SIR
3845-181096-0027 IT IS VERY SHAKY AND IRREGULAR ALSO I NOTICE THAT THE CHILDREN SEEM STUPID AND DULL I DON'T LIKE PUTTING IT SO PLAINLY BUT IN FACT
3845-181096-0028 HE UNDERSTOOD AND LOVED HIS PUPILS AND WOULD NOT HAVE ASPERSIONS CAST UPON THEM
3845-181096-0029 HAS TO MILK AND WORK HARD BEFORE AND AFTER SCHOOL BESIDES WALK ON AN AVERAGE TWO MILES TO AND FROM SCHOOL IN THIS INFERNAL HEAT MOST OF THE ELDER BOYS AND GIRLS MILK ON AN AVERAGE FOURTEEN COWS MORNING AND EVENING
3845-181096-0030 YOU TRY THAT TREATMENT FOR A WEEK OR TWO MY FINE GENTLEMAN AND THEN SEE IF YOUR FIST DOESN'T ACHE AND SHAKE SO THAT YOU CAN'T WRITE AT ALL SEE IF YOU WON'T LOOK A TRIFLE DOZY

3845-181096-0032 AT THIS JUNCTURE THEY WENT OUTSIDE TOGETHER
3845-181096-0033 THAT IS ALL WE HEARD OF THE MATTER EXCEPT THE NUMEROUS GARBLED ACCOUNTS WHICH WERE CARRIED HOME THAT AFTERNOON A DROUGHT IDYLL SYBYLLA WHAT ARE YOU DOING WHERE IS YOUR MOTHER I'M IRONING

3845-181096-0036 GOT THE LEG ROPES AND SET OFF PULLING MY SUN BONNET CLOSELY OVER MY FACE TO PROTECT MY EYES FROM THE DUST
3845-181096-0037 STRAPPED TOGETHER SO THEY COULD BE STOOD UP IT WAS AN ARRANGEMENT FATHER HAD DEVISED TO FACILITATE OUR LABOUR IN LIFTING THE COWS
3845-181096-0038 NEW CHUM COWS WOULD SULK AND WE WOULD HAVE GREAT WORK WITH THEM BUT THOSE USED TO THE PERFORMANCE WOULD HELP THEMSELVES AND UP THEY'D GO AS NICE AS A DAISY
3845-181096-0039 ON THIS AFTERNOON WE HAD SIX COWS TO LIFT WE STRUGGLED MANFULLY AND GOT FIVE ON THEIR FEET AND THEN PROCEEDED TO WHERE THE LAST ONE WAS LYING BACK DOWNWARDS ON A SHADELESS STONY SPOT ON THE SIDE OF A HILL
3845-181096-0040 THE MEN SLEWED HER ROUND BY THE TAIL WHILE MOTHER AND I FIXED THE DOG LEG AND ADJUSTED THE ROPES WE GOT THE COW UP BUT THE POOR BEAST WAS SO WEAK AND KNOCKED ABOUT THAT SHE IMMEDIATELY FELL DOWN AGAIN WE RESOLVED TO LET HER HAVE A FEW MINUTES SPELL BEFORE MAKING ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT LIFTING
3845-181096-0041 THERE WAS NOT A BLADE OF GRASS TO BE SEEN AND THE GROUND WAS TOO DUSTY TO SIT ON WE WERE TOO OVERDONE TO MAKE MORE THAN ONE WORDED UTTERANCES SO WAITED SILENTLY IN THE BLAZING SUN CLOSING OUR EYES AGAINST THE DUST WEARINESS WEARINESS
3845-181096-0042 A FEW LIGHT WIND SMITTEN CLOUDS MADE WAN STREAKS ACROSS THE WHITE SKY HAGGARD WITH THE FIERCE RELENTLESS GLARE OF THE AFTERNOON SUN WEARINESS WAS WRITTEN ACROSS MY MOTHER'S DELICATE CAREWORN FEATURES AND FOUND EXPRESSION IN MY FATHER'S KNITTED BROWS AND DUSTY FACE
3845-181096-0043 BLACKSHAW WAS WEARY AND SAID SO AS HE WIPED THE DUST MADE MUD WITH PERSPIRATION OFF HIS CHEEKS I WAS WEARY MY LIMBS ACHED WITH THE HEAT AND WORK THE POOR BEAST STRETCHED AT OUR FEET WAS WEARY ALL NATURE WAS WEARY
3845-181096-0044 ALL WERE WEARY ALL BUT THE SUN HE SEEMED TO GLORY IN HIS POWER RELENTLESS AND UNTIRING AS HE SWUNG BOLDLY IN THE SKY TRIUMPHANTLY LEERING DOWN UPON HIS HELPLESS VICTIMS WEARINESS WEARINESS
3845-181096-0045 MY LIFE MY CAREER MY BRILLIANT CAREER I WAS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN A FEW FLEETING HOURS AND I WOULD BE OLD AS THOSE AROUND ME I LOOKED AT THEM AS THEY STOOD THERE WEARY AND TURNING DOWN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HILL OF LIFE
3845-181096-0046 WHEN YOUNG NO DOUBT THEY HAD HOPED FOR AND DREAMED OF BETTER THINGS HAD EVEN KNOWN THEM BUT HERE THEY WERE THIS HAD BEEN THEIR LIFE THIS WAS THEIR CAREER IT WAS AND IN ALL PROBABILITY WOULD BE MINE TOO

3845-181096-0048 WHAT A GREAT DULL HARD ROCK THE WORLD WAS
3845-181096-0049 THE POOR BEAST MOANED THE LIFTING HAD STRAINED HER AND THERE WERE PATCHES OF HIDE WORN OFF HER THE SIZE OF BREAKFAST PLATES
3845-181096-0050 IT TAKES GREAT SUFFERING TO WRING A MOAN FROM THE PATIENCE OF A COW I TURNED MY HEAD AWAY AND WITH THE IMPATIENCE AND ONE SIDED REASONING COMMON TO FIFTEEN ASKED GOD WHAT HE MEANT BY THIS
3845-181096-0051 AT IT WE WENT AGAIN IT IS SURPRISING WHAT WEIGHT THERE IS IN THE POOREST COW
3845-181096-0052 WE MARCHED HER HOME AND GAVE HER A BRAN MASH THEN WE TURNED TO OUR WORK IN THE HOUSE WHILE THE MEN SAT AND SMOKED AND SPAT ON THE VERANDA DISCUSSING THE DROUGHT FOR AN HOUR AT THE END OF WHICH TIME THEY WENT TO HELP SOMEONE ELSE WITH THEIR STOCK I MADE UP THE FIRE AND WE CONTINUED OUR IRONING
3845-181096-0053 WHICH HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED SOME HOURS BEFORE IT WAS HOT UNPLEASANT WORK ON SUCH A DAY WE WERE FORCED TO KEEP THE DOORS AND WINDOWS CLOSED ON ACCOUNT OF THE WIND AND DUST WE WERE HOT AND TIRED AND OUR FEET ACHED SO THAT WE COULD SCARCELY STAND ON THEM WEARINESS WEARINESS
3845-181096-0054 DAY AFTER DAY THE DROUGHT CONTINUED
3845-181096-0055 TAKING WITH IT THE FEW CLOUDS IT HAD GATHERED UP AND FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS AT A STRETCH FROM HORIZON TO HORIZON
3845-181096-0056 WEARINESS WEARINESS
