373-130974-0000 TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AFTER AN UNEQUIVOCAL EXPERIENCE OF THE INEFFICACY OF THE SUBSISTING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YOU ARE CALLED UPON TO DELIBERATE ON A NEW CONSTITUTION FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
373-130974-0001 THE SUBJECT SPEAKS ITS OWN IMPORTANCE COMPREHENDING IN ITS CONSEQUENCES NOTHING LESS THAN THE EXISTENCE OF THE UNION THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE PARTS OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED THE FATE OF AN EMPIRE IN MANY RESPECTS THE MOST INTERESTING IN THE WORLD
373-130974-0002 IT HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY REMARKED THAT IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN RESERVED TO THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY BY THEIR CONDUCT AND EXAMPLE TO DECIDE THE IMPORTANT QUESTION WHETHER SOCIETIES OF MEN ARE REALLY CAPABLE OR NOT
373-130974-0003 OF ESTABLISHING GOOD GOVERNMENT FROM REFLECTION AND CHOICE OR WHETHER THEY ARE FOREVER DESTINED TO DEPEND FOR THEIR POLITICAL CONSTITUTIONS ON ACCIDENT AND FORCE IF THERE BE ANY TRUTH IN THE REMARK
373-130974-0004 THE CRISIS AT WHICH WE ARE ARRIVED MAY WITH PROPRIETY BE REGARDED AS THE ERA IN WHICH THAT DECISION IS TO BE MADE AND A WRONG ELECTION OF THE PART WE SHALL ACT MAY IN THIS VIEW
373-130974-0005 BUT THIS IS A THING MORE ARDENTLY TO BE WISHED THAN SERIOUSLY TO BE EXPECTED THE PLAN OFFERED TO OUR DELIBERATIONS AFFECTS TOO MANY PARTICULAR INTERESTS INNOVATES UPON TOO MANY LOCAL INSTITUTIONS
373-130974-0006 NOT TO INVOLVE IN ITS DISCUSSION A VARIETY OF OBJECTS FOREIGN TO ITS MERITS AND OF VIEWS PASSIONS AND PREJUDICES LITTLE FAVORABLE TO THE DISCOVERY OF TRUTH
373-130974-0007 AMONG THE MOST FORMIDABLE OF THE OBSTACLES WHICH THE NEW CONSTITUTION WILL HAVE TO ENCOUNTER MAY READILY BE DISTINGUISHED THE OBVIOUS INTEREST OF A CERTAIN CLASS OF MEN IN EVERY STATE TO RESIST ALL CHANGES WHICH MAY HAZARD A DIMINUTION
373-130974-0008 OF THE POWER EMOLUMENT AND CONSEQUENCE OF THE OFFICES THEY HOLD UNDER THE STATE ESTABLISHMENTS AND THE PERVERTED AMBITION OF ANOTHER CLASS OF MEN WHO WILL EITHER HOPE TO AGGRANDIZE THEMSELVES BY THE CONFUSIONS OF THEIR COUNTRY
373-130974-0009 I AM WELL AWARE THAT IT WOULD BE DISINGENUOUS TO RESOLVE INDISCRIMINATELY THE OPPOSITION OF ANY SET OF MEN MERELY BECAUSE THEIR SITUATIONS MIGHT SUBJECT THEM TO SUSPICION INTO INTERESTED OR AMBITIOUS VIEWS CANDOR WILL OBLIGE US TO ADMIT
373-130974-0010 THAT EVEN SUCH MEN MAY BE ACTUATED BY UPRIGHT INTENTIONS AND IT CANNOT BE DOUBTED THAT MUCH OF THE OPPOSITION WHICH HAS MADE ITS APPEARANCE OR MAY HEREAFTER MAKE ITS APPEARANCE WILL SPRING FROM SOURCES BLAMELESS AT LEAST IF NOT RESPECTABLE
373-130974-0011 THE HONEST ERRORS OF MINDS LED ASTRAY BY PRECONCEIVED JEALOUSIES AND FEARS SO NUMEROUS INDEED AND SO POWERFUL ARE THE CAUSES WHICH SERVE TO GIVE A FALSE BIAS TO THE JUDGMENT THAT WE UPON MANY OCCASIONS
373-130974-0012 SEE WISE AND GOOD MEN ON THE WRONG AS WELL AS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF QUESTIONS OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE TO SOCIETY THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IF DULY ATTENDED TO WOULD FURNISH A LESSON OF MODERATION TO THOSE WHO ARE EVER SO MUCH PERSUADED
373-130974-0013 ARE INFLUENCED BY PURER PRINCIPLES THAN THEIR ANTAGONISTS AMBITION AVARICE PERSONAL ANIMOSITY PARTY OPPOSITION AND MANY OTHER MOTIVES NOT MORE LAUDABLE THAN THESE
373-130974-0014 ARE APT TO OPERATE AS WELL UPON THOSE WHO SUPPORT AS THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE RIGHT SIDE OF A QUESTION WERE THERE NOT EVEN THESE INDUCEMENTS TO MODERATION NOTHING COULD BE MORE ILL JUDGED THAN THAT INTOLERANT SPIRIT WHICH HAS AT ALL TIMES
373-130974-0015 CHARACTERIZED POLITICAL PARTIES FOR IN POLITICS AS IN RELIGION IT IS EQUALLY ABSURD TO AIM AT MAKING PROSELYTES BY FIRE AND SWORD HERESIES IN EITHER CAN RARELY BE CURED BY PERSECUTION AND YET
373-130974-0016 HOWEVER JUST THESE SENTIMENTS WILL BE ALLOWED TO BE WE HAVE ALREADY SUFFICIENT INDICATIONS THAT IT WILL HAPPEN IN THIS AS IN ALL FORMER CASES OF GREAT NATIONAL DISCUSSION A TORRENT OF ANGRY AND MALIGNANT PASSIONS WILL BE LET LOOSE
373-130974-0017 TO JUDGE FROM THE CONDUCT OF THE OPPOSITE PARTIES WE SHALL BE LED TO CONCLUDE THAT THEY WILL MUTUALLY HOPE TO EVINCE THE JUSTNESS OF THEIR OPINIONS AND TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THEIR CONVERTS BY THE LOUDNESS OF THEIR DECLAMATIONS AND THE BITTERNESS OF THEIR INVECTIVES
373-130974-0018 WHICH IS MORE COMMONLY THE FAULT OF THE HEAD THAN OF THE HEART WILL BE REPRESENTED AS MERE PRETENSE AND ARTIFICE THE STALE BAIT FOR POPULARITY AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PUBLIC GOOD IT WILL BE FORGOTTEN ON THE ONE HAND THAT JEALOUSY IS THE USUAL CONCOMITANT OF LOVE
373-130974-0019 AND THAT THE NOBLE ENTHUSIASM OF LIBERTY IS APT TO BE INFECTED WITH A SPIRIT OF NARROW AND ILLIBERAL DISTRUST ON THE OTHER HAND IT WILL BE EQUALLY FORGOTTEN THAT THE VIGOR OF GOVERNMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE SECURITY OF LIBERTY
373-130974-0020 THAT IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF A SOUND AND WELL INFORMED JUDGMENT THEIR INTEREST CAN NEVER BE SEPARATED AND THAT A DANGEROUS AMBITION MORE OFTEN LURKS BEHIND THE SPECIOUS MASK OF ZEAL FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE
373-130974-0021 THAN UNDER THE FORBIDDEN APPEARANCE OF ZEAL FOR THE FIRMNESS AND EFFICIENCY OF GOVERNMENT HISTORY WILL TEACH US THAT THE FORMER HAS BEEN FOUND A MUCH MORE CERTAIN ROAD TO THE INTRODUCTION OF DESPOTISM THAN THE LATTER
373-130974-0022 AND THAT OF THOSE MEN WHO HAVE OVERTURNED THE LIBERTIES OF REPUBLICS THE GREATEST NUMBER HAVE BEGUN THEIR CAREER BY PAYING AN OBSEQUIOUS COURT TO THE PEOPLE COMMENCING DEMAGOGUES AND ENDING TYRANTS
373-130974-0023 IN THE COURSE OF THE PRECEDING OBSERVATIONS I HAVE HAD AN EYE MY FELLOW CITIZENS TO PUTTING YOU UPON YOUR GUARD AGAINST ALL ATTEMPTS FROM WHATEVER QUARTER TO INFLUENCE YOUR DECISION IN A MATTER OF THE UTMOST MOMENT TO YOUR WELFARE
373-130974-0024 BY ANY IMPRESSIONS OTHER THAN THOSE WHICH MAY RESULT FROM THE EVIDENCE OF TRUTH YOU WILL NO DOUBT AT THE SAME TIME HAVE COLLECTED FROM THE GENERAL SCOPE OF THEM THAT THEY PROCEED FROM A SOURCE NOT UNFRIENDLY TO THE NEW CONSTITUTION
373-130974-0025 YES MY COUNTRYMEN I OWN TO YOU THAT AFTER HAVING GIVEN IT AN ATTENTIVE CONSIDERATION I AM CLEARLY OF OPINION IT IS YOUR INTEREST TO ADOPT IT I AM CONVINCED THAT THIS IS THE SAFEST COURSE FOR YOUR LIBERTY YOUR DIGNITY
373-130974-0026 AND YOUR HAPPINESS I AFFECT NOT RESERVES WHICH I DO NOT FEEL I WILL NOT AMUSE YOU WITH AN APPEARANCE OF DELIBERATION WHEN I HAVE DECIDED I FRANKLY ACKNOWLEDGE TO YOU MY CONVICTIONS
373-130974-0027 AND I WILL FREELY LAY BEFORE YOU THE REASONS ON WHICH THEY ARE FOUNDED THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF GOOD INTENTIONS DISDAINS AMBIGUITY I SHALL NOT HOWEVER MULTIPLY PROFESSIONS ON THIS HEAD MY MOTIVES MUST REMAIN IN THE DEPOSITORY OF MY OWN BREAST
373-130974-0028 ITS ANALOGY TO YOUR OWN STATE CONSTITUTION AND LASTLY THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY WHICH ITS ADOPTION WILL AFFORD TO THE PRESERVATION OF THAT SPECIES OF GOVERNMENT TO LIBERTY AND TO PROPERTY
373-130974-0029 IN THE PROGRESS OF THIS DISCUSSION I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO GIVE A SATISFACTORY ANSWER TO ALL THE OBJECTIONS WHICH SHALL HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE THAT MAY SEEM TO HAVE ANY CLAIM TO YOUR ATTENTION
373-130974-0030 IT MAY PERHAPS BE THOUGHT SUPERFLUOUS TO OFFER ARGUMENTS TO PROVE THE UTILITY OF THE UNION A POINT NO DOUBT DEEPLY ENGRAVED ON THE HEARTS OF THE GREAT BODY OF THE PEOPLE IN EVERY STATE AND ONE WHICH IT MAY BE IMAGINED
373-130974-0031 RESORT TO SEPARATE CONFEDERACIES OF DISTINCT PORTIONS OF THE WHOLE
373-130974-0032 IN ALL PROBABILITY BE GRADUALLY PROPAGATED TILL IT HAS VOTARIES ENOUGH TO COUNTENANCE AN OPEN AVOWAL OF IT FOR NOTHING CAN BE MORE EVIDENT TO THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO TAKE AN ENLARGED VIEW OF THE SUBJECT
373-130974-0033 THAN THE ALTERNATIVE OF AN ADOPTION OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION OR A DISMEMBERMENT OF THE UNION IT WILL THEREFORE BE OF USE TO BEGIN BY EXAMINING THE ADVANTAGES OF THAT UNION
373-130974-0034 THE CERTAIN EVILS AND THE PROBABLE DANGERS TO WHICH EVERY STATE WILL BE EXPOSED FROM ITS DISSOLUTION THIS SHALL ACCORDINGLY CONSTITUTE THE SUBJECT OF MY NEXT ADDRESS
