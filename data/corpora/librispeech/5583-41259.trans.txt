5583-41259-0000 IN THE PERUSAL OF THE FOLLOWING PAGES YOUR SENSIBILITY WILL BE MOST SEVERELY TRIED AH WHAT WERE THE MISFORTUNES I HAD BEFORE EXPERIENCED AND WHICH I HAVE ALREADY RELATED TO YOU TO THE ONE I AM NOW GOING TO INFORM YOU OF
5583-41259-0001 THE DEATH OF MY FATHER AND MY MOTHER AND MY HUSBAND THOUGH ALMOST MORE THAN MY GENTLE NATURE COULD SUPPORT WERE TRIFLES IN COMPARISON TO THE MISFORTUNE I AM NOW PROCEEDING TO RELATE
5583-41259-0002 BUT BY SUPPOSING THAT THE BODILY EXERTIONS I HAD UNDERGONE IN MY REPEATED FITS OF FRENZY HAD SO EFFECTUALLY CIRCULATED AND WARMED MY BLOOD AS TO MAKE ME PROOF AGAINST THE CHILLING DAMPS OF NIGHT
5583-41259-0003 WHEREAS SOPHIA LYING TOTALLY INACTIVE ON THE GROUND MUST HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO ALL THEIR SEVERITY I WAS MOST SERIOUSLY ALARMED BY HER ILLNESS WHICH TRIFLING AS IT MAY APPEAR TO YOU
5583-41259-0004 A CERTAIN INSTINCTIVE SENSIBILITY WHISPERED ME WOULD IN THE END BE FATAL TO HER ALAS MY FEARS WERE BUT TOO FULLY JUSTIFIED SHE GREW GRADUALLY WORSE AND I DAILY BECAME MORE ALARMED FOR HER
5583-41259-0005 AMIDST ALL MY LAMENTATIONS FOR HER AND VIOLENT YOU MAY SUPPOSE THEY WERE I YET RECEIVED SOME CONSOLATION IN THE REFLECTION OF MY HAVING PAID EVERY ATTENTION TO HER THAT COULD BE OFFERED IN HER ILLNESS
5583-41259-0006 I HAD WEPT OVER HER EVERY DAY HAD BATHED HER SWEET FACE WITH MY TEARS AND HAD PRESSED HER FAIR HANDS CONTINUALLY IN MINE MY BELOVED LAURA
5583-41259-0007 IF TOO OFTEN REPEATED AND AT IMPROPER SEASONS PROVE DESTRUCTIVE TO YOUR CONSTITUTION MY FATE WILL TEACH YOU THIS I DIE A MARTYR TO MY GREIF FOR THE LOSS OF AUGUSTUS
5583-41259-0008 ONE FATAL SWOON HAS COST ME MY LIFE BEWARE OF SWOONS DEAR LAURA A FRENZY FIT IS NOT ONE QUARTER SO PERNICIOUS IT IS AN EXERCISE TO THE BODY
5583-41259-0009 IT WAS HER DIEING ADVICE TO HER AFFLICTED LAURA WHO HAS EVER MOST FAITHFULLY ADHERED TO IT AFTER HAVING ATTENDED MY LAMENTED FREIND TO HER EARLY GRAVE I IMMEDIATELY THO LATE AT NIGHT
5583-41259-0010 THAT I COULD NOT DISTINGUISH THE NUMBER OF MY FELLOW TRAVELLERS I COULD ONLY PERCEIVE THAT THEY WERE MANY REGARDLESS HOWEVER OF ANYTHING CONCERNING THEM I GAVE MYSELF UP TO MY OWN SAD REFLECTIONS
5583-41259-0011 A GENERAL SILENCE PREVAILED A SILENCE WHICH WAS BY NOTHING INTERRUPTED BUT BY THE LOUD AND REPEATED SNORES OF ONE OF THE PARTY WHAT AN ILLITERATE VILLAIN MUST THAT MAN BE THOUGHT I TO MYSELF
5583-41259-0012 WHAT A TOTAL WANT OF DELICATE REFINEMENT MUST HE HAVE WHO CAN THUS SHOCK OUR SENSES BY SUCH A BRUTAL NOISE HE MUST I AM CERTAIN BE CAPABLE OF EVERY BAD ACTION THERE IS NO CRIME TOO BLACK FOR SUCH A CHARACTER
5583-41259-0013 IMAGINE MY SURPRISE AT FINDING MYSELF THUS SEATED AMONGST MY OLD ACQUAINTANCE GREAT AS WAS MY ASTONISHMENT IT WAS YET INCREASED WHEN ON LOOKING OUT OF WINDOWS I BEHELD THE HUSBAND OF PHILIPPA WITH PHILIPPA BY HIS SIDE
5583-41259-0014 ON THE COACHBOX AND WHEN ON LOOKING BEHIND I BEHELD PHILANDER AND GUSTAVUS IN THE BASKET OH HEAVENS EXCLAIMED I IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD SO UNEXPECTEDLY BE SURROUNDED BY MY NEAREST RELATIONS AND CONNECTIONS
5583-41259-0015 THESE WORDS ROUSED THE REST OF THE PARTY AND EVERY EYE WAS DIRECTED TO THE CORNER IN WHICH I SAT OH MY ISABEL CONTINUED I THROWING MYSELF ACROSS LADY DOROTHEA INTO HER ARMS
5583-41259-0016 RECEIVE ONCE MORE TO YOUR BOSOM THE UNFORTUNATE LAURA ALAS WHEN WE LAST PARTED IN THE VALE OF USK I WAS HAPPY IN BEING UNITED TO THE BEST OF EDWARDS
5583-41259-0017 I HAD THEN A FATHER AND A MOTHER AND HAD NEVER KNOWN MISFORTUNES BUT NOW DEPRIVED OF EVERY FREIND BUT YOU WHAT INTERRUPTED AUGUSTA IS MY BROTHER DEAD THEN TELL US I INTREAT YOU
5583-41259-0018 WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM YES COLD AND INSENSIBLE NYMPH REPLIED I THAT LUCKLESS SWAIN YOUR BROTHER IS NO MORE AND YOU MAY NOW GLORY IN BEING THE HEIRESS OF SIR EDWARD'S FORTUNE
5583-41259-0019 ALTHOUGH I HAD ALWAYS DESPISED HER FROM THE DAY I HAD OVERHEARD HER CONVERSATION WITH MY EDWARD YET IN CIVILITY I COMPLIED WITH HERS AND SIR EDWARD'S INTREATIES THAT I WOULD INFORM THEM OF THE WHOLE MELANCHOLY AFFAIR
5583-41259-0020 THEY WERE GREATLY SHOCKED EVEN THE OBDURATE HEART OF SIR EDWARD AND THE INSENSIBLE ONE OF AUGUSTA WERE TOUCHED WITH SORROW BY THE UNHAPPY TALE AT THE REQUEST OF YOUR MOTHER
5583-41259-0021 AND BARBAROUS TREATMENT OF US IN OBLIGING US TO LEAVE THE HOUSE OF OUR LAMENTATIONS ON THE LOSS OF EDWARD AND AUGUSTUS AND FINALLY OF THE MELANCHOLY DEATH OF MY BELOVED COMPANION
5583-41259-0022 FAULTLESS AS MY CONDUCT HAD CERTAINLY BEEN DURING THE WHOLE COURSE OF MY LATE MISFORTUNES AND ADVENTURES SHE PRETENDED TO FIND FAULT WITH MY BEHAVIOUR IN MANY OF THE SITUATIONS IN WHICH I HAD BEEN PLACED
5583-41259-0023 I PAID LITTLE ATTENTION TO WHAT SHE SAID AND DESIRED HER TO SATISFY MY CURIOSITY BY INFORMING ME HOW SHE CAME THERE INSTEAD OF WOUNDING MY SPOTLESS REPUTATION WITH UNJUSTIFIABLE REPROACHES
5583-41259-0024 I APPLIED TO AUGUSTA FOR THE SAME INFORMATION RESPECTING HERSELF SIR EDWARD AND LADY DOROTHEA SHE TOLD ME THAT HAVING A CONSIDERABLE TASTE FOR THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE
5583-41259-0025 HER CURIOSITY TO BEHOLD THE DELIGHTFUL SCENES IT EXHIBITED IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD HAD BEEN SO MUCH RAISED BY GILPIN'S TOUR TO THE HIGHLANDS THAT SHE HAD PREVAILED ON HER FATHER TO UNDERTAKE A TOUR TO SCOTLAND AND HAD PERSUADED LADY DOROTHEA TO ACCOMPANY THEM
5583-41259-0026 THAT THEY HAD ARRIVED AT EDINBURGH A FEW DAYS BEFORE AND FROM THENCE HAD MADE DAILY EXCURSIONS INTO THE COUNTRY AROUND IN THE STAGE COACH THEY WERE THEN IN FROM ONE OF WHICH EXCURSIONS THEY WERE AT THAT TIME RETURNING
5583-41259-0027 MY NEXT ENQUIRIES WERE CONCERNING PHILIPPA AND HER HUSBAND THE LATTER OF WHOM I LEARNED HAVING SPENT ALL HER FORTUNE HAD RECOURSE FOR SUBSISTENCE TO THE TALENT IN WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS MOST EXCELLED NAMELY DRIVING
5583-41259-0028 AND THAT HAVING SOLD EVERY THING WHICH BELONGED TO THEM EXCEPT THEIR COACH
5583-41259-0029 AND IN ORDER TO BE REMOVED FROM ANY OF HIS FORMER ACQUAINTANCE HAD DRIVEN IT TO EDINBURGH FROM WHENCE HE WENT TO STERLING EVERY OTHER DAY THAT PHILIPPA STILL RETAINING HER AFFECTION FOR HER UNGRATEFULL HUSBAND HAD FOLLOWED HIM TO SCOTLAND
5583-41259-0030 AND GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED HIM IN HIS LITTLE EXCURSIONS TO STERLING IT HAS ONLY BEEN TO THROW A LITTLE MONEY INTO THEIR POCKETS CONTINUED AUGUSTA
5583-41259-0031 FOR IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE AGREABLE TO US TO VISIT THE HIGHLANDS IN A POSTCHAISE THAN MERELY TO TRAVEL FROM EDINBURGH TO STERLING AND FROM STERLING TO EDINBURGH EVERY OTHER DAY IN A CROWDED AND UNCOMFORTABLE STAGE
5583-41259-0032 I PERFECTLY AGREED WITH HER IN HER SENTIMENTS ON THE AFFAIR AND SECRETLY BLAMED SIR EDWARD FOR THUS SACRIFICING HIS DAUGHTER'S PLEASURE FOR THE SAKE OF A RIDICULOUS OLD WOMAN WHOSE FOLLY IN MARRYING SO YOUNG A MAN OUGHT TO BE PUNISHED
5583-41259-0033 LAURA LETTER THE FIFTEENTH LAURA IN CONTINUATION WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE TOWN WHERE WE WERE TO BREAKFAST I WAS DETERMINED TO SPEAK WITH PHILANDER AND GUSTAVUS AND TO THAT PURPOSE AS SOON AS I LEFT THE CARRIAGE
5583-41259-0034 EXPRESSING MY FEARS OF THE UNEASINESS OF THEIR SITUATION AT FIRST THEY SEEMED RATHER CONFUSED AT MY APPEARANCE DREADING NO DOUBT THAT I MIGHT CALL THEM TO ACCOUNT FOR THE MONEY WHICH OUR GRANDFATHER HAD LEFT ME AND WHICH THEY HAD UNJUSTLY DEPRIVED ME OF
5583-41259-0035 BUT FINDING THAT I MENTIONED NOTHING OF THE MATTER THEY DESIRED ME TO STEP INTO THE BASKET AS WE MIGHT THERE CONVERSE WITH GREATER EASE ACCORDINGLY I ENTERED AND WHILST THE REST OF THE PARTY WERE DEVOURING GREEN TEA AND BUTTERED TOAST
5583-41259-0036 WE FEASTED OURSELVES IN A MORE REFINED AND SENTIMENTAL MANNER BY A CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATION I INFORMED THEM OF EVERY THING WHICH HAD BEFALLEN ME DURING THE COURSE OF MY LIFE AND AT MY REQUEST THEY RELATED TO ME EVERY INCIDENT OF THEIRS
5583-41259-0037 WE ARE THE SONS AS YOU ALREADY KNOW OF THE TWO YOUNGEST DAUGHTERS WHICH LORD SAINT CLAIR HAD BY LAURINA AN ITALIAN OPERA GIRL OUR MOTHERS COULD NEITHER OF THEM EXACTLY ASCERTAIN WHO WERE OUR FATHER
5583-41259-0038 BUT AS THEY HAD ALWAYS LIVED ON THE PRINCIPAL OF IT WHEN WE WERE FIFTEEN IT WAS DIMINISHED TO NINE HUNDRED THIS NINE HUNDRED THEY ALWAYS KEPT IN A DRAWER IN ONE OF THE TABLES WHICH STOOD IN OUR COMMON SITTING PARLOUR FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF HAVING IT ALWAYS AT HAND
5583-41259-0039 WHETHER IT WAS FROM THIS CIRCUMSTANCE OF ITS BEING EASILY TAKEN OR FROM A WISH OF BEING INDEPENDANT OR FROM AN EXCESS OF SENSIBILITY FOR WHICH WE WERE ALWAYS REMARKABLE I CANNOT NOW DETERMINE
5583-41259-0040 BUT CERTAIN IT IS THAT WHEN WE HAD REACHED OUR FIFTEENTH YEAR WE TOOK THE NINE HUNDRED POUNDS AND RAN AWAY HAVING OBTAINED THIS PRIZE WE WERE DETERMINED TO MANAGE IT WITH EOCONOMY AND NOT TO SPEND IT EITHER WITH FOLLY OR EXTRAVAGANCE
5583-41259-0041 THE FOURTH TO CARRIAGES THE FIFTH TO HORSES THE SIXTH TO SERVANTS THE SEVENTH TO AMUSEMENTS THE EIGHTH TO CLOATHES AND THE NINTH TO SILVER BUCKLES HAVING THUS ARRANGED OUR EXPENCES FOR TWO MONTHS
5583-41259-0042 AS IT CONSISTED ONLY OF THE MANAGER HIS WIFE AND OURSELVES BUT THERE WERE FEWER TO PAY AND THE ONLY INCONVENIENCE ATTENDING IT WAS THE SCARCITY OF PLAYS WHICH FOR WANT OF PEOPLE TO FILL THE CHARACTERS WE COULD PERFORM
5583-41259-0043 AND PHILANDER ACTED ALL THE REST TO SAY THE TRUTH THIS TRAGEDY WAS NOT ONLY THE BEST BUT THE ONLY PLAY THAT WE EVER PERFORMED AND AFTER HAVING ACTED IT ALL OVER ENGLAND AND WALES WE CAME TO SCOTLAND TO EXHIBIT IT OVER THE REMAINDER OF GREAT BRITAIN
5583-41259-0044 WE AGREED TO ENDEAVOUR TO GET SOMETHING FROM HIM BY DISCOVERING THE RELATIONSHIP YOU KNOW HOW WELL IT SUCCEEDED HAVING OBTAINED THE TWO HUNDRED POUNDS WE INSTANTLY LEFT THE TOWN LEAVING OUR MANAGER AND HIS WIFE TO ACT MACBETH BY THEMSELVES
5583-41259-0045 AND SUCH MY DEAR COUSIN IS OUR HISTORY I THANKED THE AMIABLE YOUTH FOR HIS ENTERTAINING NARRATION AND AFTER EXPRESSING MY WISHES FOR THEIR WELFARE AND HAPPINESS LEFT THEM IN THEIR LITTLE HABITATION AND RETURNED TO MY OTHER FREINDS WHO IMPATIENTLY EXPECTED ME
5583-41259-0046 MY ADVENTURES ARE NOW DRAWING TO A CLOSE MY DEAREST MARIANNE AT LEAST FOR THE PRESENT WHEN WE ARRIVED AT EDINBURGH SIR EDWARD TOLD ME THAT AS THE WIDOW OF HIS SON
5583-41259-0047 I GRACIOUSLY PROMISED THAT I WOULD BUT COULD NOT HELP OBSERVING THAT THE UNSIMPATHETIC BARONET OFFERED IT MORE ON ACCOUNT OF MY BEING THE WIDOW OF EDWARD THAN IN BEING THE REFINED AND AMIABLE LAURA
5583-41259-0048 WHERE I HAVE EVER SINCE CONTINUED AND WHERE I CAN UNINTERRUPTED BY UNMEANING VISITS INDULGE IN A MELANCHOLY SOLITUDE MY UNCEASING LAMENTATIONS FOR THE DEATH OF MY FATHER MY MOTHER MY HUSBAND AND MY FREIND
5583-41259-0049 AT THE SAME TIME MARRIED LADY DOROTHEA HIS WISHES HAVE BEEN ANSWERED PHILANDER AND GUSTAVUS AFTER HAVING RAISED THEIR REPUTATION BY THEIR PERFORMANCES IN THE THEATRICAL LINE AT EDINBURGH REMOVED TO COVENT GARDEN
5583-41259-0050 WHERE THEY STILL EXHIBIT UNDER THE ASSUMED NAMES OF LUVIS AND QUICK PHILIPPA HAS LONG PAID THE DEBT OF NATURE HER HUSBAND HOWEVER STILL CONTINUES TO DRIVE THE STAGE COACH FROM EDINBURGH TO STERLING ADEIU MY DEAREST MARIANNE
