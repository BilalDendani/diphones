5772-43315-0000 UNPARALLELED IN HISTORY
5772-43315-0001 A GROUP KNEELING BEFORE A PICTURE
5772-43315-0002 THE ASPECT OF THE CROWD THAT HAD WAITED IN WESTMINSTER TO HEAR THE RESULT OF THE OFFER MADE TO THE STRANGER
5772-43315-0003 POINTING OUT THEIR HYSTERICAL ENTHUSIASM HE EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO VENTURE UPON PROPHECY AND TO DECLARE HIS BELIEF THAT PERSECUTION WAS WITHIN REASONABLE DISTANCE THE WORLD SEEMS VERY ODDLY ALIVE HE SAID
5772-43315-0004 IT IS AS IF THE WHOLE THING WAS FLUSHED AND NERVOUS THE CARDINAL NODDED WE TOO HE SAID EVEN WE FEEL IT FOR THE REST THE CARDINAL HAD SAT WATCHING HIM OUT OF HIS NARROW EYES NODDING FROM TIME TO TIME
5772-43315-0005 PUTTING AN OCCASIONAL QUESTION BUT LISTENING THROUGHOUT WITH GREAT ATTENTION AND YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS FATHER HE HAD SAID AND THEN INTERRUPTED HIMSELF NO THAT IS TOO MUCH TO ASK THE HOLY FATHER WILL SPEAK OF THAT
5772-43315-0006 HE HAD CONGRATULATED HIM UPON HIS LATIN THEN
5772-43315-0007 AT HIS SECOND TAP THE DOOR OPENED AND THE CARDINAL CAME OUT TAKING HIM BY THE ARM WITHOUT A WORD AND TOGETHER THEY TURNED TO THE LIFT ENTRANCE
5772-43315-0008 I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT A SWISS GUARD FLUNG BACK THE DOOR OF THE LIFT SALUTED AND WENT BEFORE THEM ALONG THE PLAIN FLAGGED PASSAGE TO WHERE HIS COMRADE STOOD THEN HE SALUTED AGAIN AND WENT BACK
5772-43315-0009 IT REALLY SEEMED ALMOST INCREDIBLE THAT SUCH THINGS STILL EXISTED IN A MOMENT YOUR EMINENCE HE SAID IN LATIN WILL YOUR EMINENCE WAIT HERE IT WAS A LITTLE SQUARE ROOM WITH HALF A DOZEN DOORS PLAINLY CONTRIVED
5772-43315-0010 GIVING THE IMPRESSION OF A CURIOUS MINGLING OF ASCETIC POVERTY AND DIGNITY BY ITS RED TILED FLOOR
5772-43315-0011 AND TWO VAST BRONZE CANDLESTICKS OF INCALCULABLE VALUE THAT STOOD ON THE
5772-43315-0012 THE SHUTTERS HERE TOO WERE DRAWN AND THERE WAS NOTHING TO DISTRACT PERCY FROM THE EXCITEMENT THAT SURGED UP NOW TENFOLD IN HEART AND BRAIN IT WAS PAPA ANGELICUS WHOM HE WAS ABOUT TO SEE
5772-43315-0013 AND POPE NINE YEARS PREVIOUSLY
5772-43315-0014 OF YIELDING THE CHURCHES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF ITALY TO THE GOVERNMENT
5772-43315-0015 AND WHO HAD SINCE SET HIMSELF TO MAKE IT A CITY OF SAINTS
5772-43315-0016 NOTHING WHATEVER FOR THE WORLD'S OPINION HIS POLICY SO FAR AS IT COULD BE CALLED ONE CONSISTED IN A VERY SIMPLE THING
5772-43315-0017 BY PRODUCING SUPERNATURAL VIRTUES IN MAN
5772-43315-0018 AND SHOULD SET AN EXAMPLE TO ITS DEPENDENCY THIS COULD NOT BE DONE UNLESS PETER RULED HIS CITY AND THEREFORE HE HAD SACRIFICED EVERY CHURCH AND ECCLESIASTICAL BUILDING IN THE COUNTRY FOR THAT ONE END THEN HE HAD SET ABOUT RULING HIS CITY
5772-43315-0019 HE HAD SAID THAT ON THE WHOLE THE LATTER DAY DISCOVERIES OF MAN TENDED TO DISTRACT IMMORTAL SOULS FROM A CONTEMPLATION OF ETERNAL VERITIES
5772-43315-0020 BUT THAT AT PRESENT THEY WERE TOO EXCITING TO THE IMAGINATION SO HE HAD REMOVED THE TRAMS THE VOLORS THE LABORATORIES THE MANUFACTORIES
5772-43315-0021 AND HAD ALLOWED THEM TO BE PLANTED IN THE SUBURBS IN THEIR PLACE HE HAD RAISED SHRINES RELIGIOUS HOUSES
5772-43315-0022 HE ALLOWED NO MAN UNDER THE AGE OF FIFTY TO LIVE WITHIN ITS WALLS FOR MORE THAN ONE MONTH IN EACH YEAR EXCEPT THOSE WHO RECEIVED HIS PERMIT THEY MIGHT LIVE OF COURSE IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE CITY
5772-43315-0023 RENTS HAD INSTANTLY BEGUN TO RISE SO HE HAD LEGISLATED AGAINST THAT BY RESERVING IN EACH QUARTER A NUMBER OF STREETS AT FIXED PRICES AND HAD ISSUED AN IPSO FACTO EXCOMMUNICATION AGAINST ALL WHO ERRED IN THIS RESPECT
5772-43315-0024 IDOLATRY AND APOSTASY FOR WHICH THIS PUNISHMENT WAS THEORETICALLY SANCTIONED THERE HAD NOT BEEN HOWEVER MORE THAN TWO SUCH EXECUTIONS IN THE EIGHT YEARS OF HIS REIGN SINCE CRIMINALS OF COURSE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DEVOTED BELIEVERS
5772-43315-0025 INSTANTLY MADE THEIR WAY TO THE SUBURBS WHERE THEY WERE NO LONGER UNDER HIS JURISDICTION BUT HE HAD NOT STAYED HERE HE HAD SENT ONCE MORE AMBASSADORS TO EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD INFORMING THE GOVERNMENT OF EACH OF THEIR ARRIVAL
5772-43315-0026 NO ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THIS BEYOND THAT OF LAUGHTER
5772-43315-0027 TO CLAIM HIS RIGHTS AND MEANWHILE USED HIS LEGATES FOR THE IMPORTANT WORK
5772-43315-0028 EPISTLES APPEARED FROM TIME TO TIME IN EVERY TOWN LAYING DOWN THE PRINCIPLES OF THE PAPAL CLAIMS WITH AS MUCH TRANQUILLITY AS IF THEY WERE EVERYWHERE ACKNOWLEDGED FREEMASONRY WAS STEADILY DENOUNCED AS WELL AS DEMOCRATIC IDEAS OF EVERY KIND
5772-43315-0029 WHO WAS CREATOR AND RULER OF THE WORLD
5772-43315-0030 WHOSE NAME AND SEAL WERE APPENDED THAT WAS A LINE OF ACTION THAT TOOK THE WORLD COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE PEOPLE HAD EXPECTED HYSTERIA
5772-43315-0031 IT WAS AS IF PROGRESS HAD NOT YET BEGUN AND VOLORS WERE UNINVENTED AS IF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE HAD NOT COME TO DISBELIEVE IN GOD AND TO DISCOVER THAT ITSELF WAS GOD
5772-43315-0032 HERE WAS THIS SILLY OLD MAN TALKING IN HIS SLEEP BABBLING OF THE CROSS AND THE INNER LIFE AND THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS EXACTLY AS HIS PREDECESSORS HAD TALKED
5772-43315-0033 AND THIS WAS THE MAN THOUGHT PERCY PAPA ANGELICUS WHOM HE WAS TO SEE IN A MINUTE OR TWO THE CARDINAL PUT HIS HAND ON THE PRIEST'S KNEE AS THE DOOR OPENED AND A PURPLE PRELATE APPEARED BOWING
5772-43315-0034 ONLY THIS HE SAID BE ABSOLUTELY FRANK
