4277-185519-0000 SUPERIOR TO CAGLIOSTRO EVEN IN ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND SECOND TO HIM IN NOTORIETY ONLY WAS THAT HUMAN NONDESCRIPT THE SO CALLED COUNT DE SAINT GERMAIN WHOM FREDRICK THE GREAT CALLED A MAN NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO MAKE OUT
4277-185519-0001 SIMON WOLFF BY NAME AND BORN AT STRASBURG ABOUT THE CLOSE OF THE SEVENTEENTH
4277-185519-0002 AND OTHERS AGAIN INTIMATE THAT HIS TRUE TITLE WAS THE MARQUIS DE BETMAR
4277-185519-0003 THE MOST PLAUSIBLE THEORY HOWEVER MAKES HIM THE NATURAL SON OF AN ITALIAN PRINCESS AND FIXES HIS BIRTH AT SAN GERMANO IN SAVOY ABOUT THE YEAR SEVENTEEN TEN HIS OSTENSIBLE FATHER BEING ONE ROTONDO A TAX COLLECTOR OF THAT DISTRICT
4277-185519-0004 THIS SUPPOSITION IS BORNE OUT BY THE FACT THAT HE SPOKE ALL HIS MANY LANGUAGES WITH AN ITALIAN ACCENT IT WAS ABOUT THE YEAR SEVENTEEN FIFTY THAT HE FIRST BEGAN TO BE HEARD OF IN EUROPE AS THE COUNT SAINT GERMAIN
4277-185519-0005 AND PUT FORTH THE ASTOUNDING PRETENSIONS THAT SOON GAVE HIM CELEBRITY OVER THE WHOLE CONTINENT
4277-185519-0006 WHOSE FAVOR HE VERY QUICKLY GAINED THE INFLUENCE OF THAT FAMOUS BEAUTY
4277-185519-0007 HE WAS REMARKABLY HANDSOME AS AN OLD PORTRAIT AT FRIERSDORF IN SAXONY IN THE ROOMS HE ONCE OCCUPIED SUFFICIENTLY INDICATED AND HIS MUSICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS ADDED TO THE INEFFABLE CHARM OF HIS MANNERS AND CONVERSATION AND THE MIRACLES HE PERFORMED
4277-185519-0008 RENDERED HIM AN IRRESISTIBLE ATTRACTION ESPECIALLY TO THE LADIES
4277-185519-0009 HE COULD ALSO PLAY EVERY INSTRUMENT THEN IN VOGUE BUT ESPECIALLY EXCELLED UPON THE VIOLIN WHICH HE COULD HANDLE IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO GIVE IT THE EFFECT OF A SMALL ORCHESTRA COTEMPORARY WRITERS DECLARE THAT
4277-185519-0010 WHEN THE COUNT WAS EXTEMPORIZING ON HIS FAVORITE CREMONA
4277-185519-0011 PUBLISHED IN ENGLAND FOR PRIVATE CIRCULATION ONLY BEARS TESTIMONY TO HIS MUSICAL GENIUS AND TO THE WONDROUS ECCENTRICITY AS WELL AS BEAUTY OF HIS CONCEPTIONS BUT IT WAS IN ALECTROMANCY OR DIVINATION BY SIGNS AND CIRCLES
4277-185519-0012 HYDROMANCY OR DIVINATION BY WATER CLEIDOMANCY OR DIVINATION BY THE KEY AND DACTYLOMANCY OR DIVINATION BY THE FINGERS THAT THE COUNT CHIEFLY EXCELLED ALTHOUGH HE AT THE SAME TIME PROFESSED ALCHEMY ASTROLOGY
4277-185519-0013 AND PROPHECY IN THE HIGHER BRANCHES THE FORTUNES OF THE COUNT SAINT GERMAIN ROSE SO RAPIDLY IN FRANCE THAT IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY
4277-185519-0014 GREATLY FEARED AND DETESTED THE COUNT AND SECRETLY WROTE TO PITT BEGGING THE LATTER TO HAVE THAT PERSONAGE ARRESTED
4277-185519-0015 RECEIVED TIMELY WARNING AND ESCAPED TO THE CONTINENT IN ENGLAND HE WAS THE INSEPARABLE FRIEND OF PRINCE LOBKOWITZ A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT GAVE SOME COLOR TO HIS ALLEGED CONNECTION WITH THE RUSSIANS
4277-185519-0016 HIS SOJOURN THERE WAS EQUALLY DISTINGUISHED BY HIS DEVOTION TO THE LADIES AND HIS UNWAVERING SUCCESS AT THE GAMING TABLE WHERE HE WON FABULOUS SUMS
4277-185519-0017 WHICH WERE AFTERWARD DISPENSED WITH IMPERIAL MUNIFICENCE IT WAS THERE TOO THAT HE PUT FORWARD HIS CLAIMS TO THE HIGHEST RANK IN MASONRY AND OF COURSE ADDED THEREBY IMMENSELY TO THE ECLAT OF HIS POSITION
4277-185519-0018 HE SPOKE ENGLISH FRENCH SPANISH PORTUGUESE ITALIAN GERMAN RUSSIAN POLISH THE SCANDINAVIAN AND MANY OF THE ORIENTAL TONGUES WITH EQUAL FLUENCY
4277-185519-0019 IN THE COURSE OF A LIFETIME WHICH WITH CONTINUAL TRANSMIGRATIONS HE DECLARED TO HAVE LASTED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS HIS BIRTH HE SAID HAD BEEN IN CHALDEA IN THE DAWN OF TIME AND THAT HE WAS THE SOLE INHERITOR OF THE LOST SCIENCES AND MYSTERIES
4277-185519-0020 OF HIS OWN AND THE EGYPTIAN RACE HE SPOKE OF HIS PERSONAL INTIMACY WITH ALL THE TWELVE APOSTLES AND EVEN THE AUGUST PRESENCE OF THE SAVIOR AND ONE OF HIS PRETENSIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN MOST SINGULARLY AMUSING HAD IT NOT BORDERED UPON PROFANITY
4277-185519-0021 REMONSTRATED WITH THE APOSTLE PETER UPON THE IRRITABILITY OF HIS TEMPERAMENT IN REGARD TO LATER PERIODS OF HISTORY HE SPOKE WITH THE CARELESS EASE OF AN EVERY DAY LOOKER ON
4277-185519-0022 AND TOLD ANECDOTES THAT THE RESEARCHES OF SCHOLARS AFTERWARDS FULLY VERIFIED HIS PREDICTIONS WERE INDEED
4277-185519-0023 HIS GIFT OF MEMORY WAS PERFECTLY AMAZING HAVING ONCE READ A JOURNAL OF THE DAY HE COULD REPEAT ITS CONTENTS ACCURATELY FROM BEGINNING TO END
4277-185519-0024 IN CHARACTERS LIKE COPPERPLATE THUS HE COULD INDITE A LOVE LETTER WITH HIS RIGHT WHILE HE COMPOSED A VERSE WITH HIS LEFT HAND AND APPARENTLY WITH THE UTMOST FACILITY A SPLENDID ACQUISITION FOR THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT
4277-185519-0025 HE WOULD HOWEVER HAVE BEEN INELIGIBLE FOR ANY FAITHFUL POST OFFICE SINCE HE READ THE CONTENTS OF SEALED LETTERS AT A GLANCE AND BY HIS CLAIRVOYANT POWERS DETECTED CRIME OR IN FACT THE MOVEMENTS OF MEN AND THE PHENOMENA OF NATURE AT ANY DISTANCE
4277-185519-0026 LIKE ALL THE GREAT MAGI AND BROTHERS OF THE ROSY CROSS OF WHOM HE CLAIMED TO BE A SHINING LIGHT HE MOST EXCELLED IN MEDICINE AND ALONG WITH REMEDIES FOR EVERY ILL THAT FLESH IS HEIR TO BOASTED HIS AQUA BENEDETTA
4277-185519-0027 AS THE GENUINE ELIXIR OF LIFE CAPABLE OF RESTORING YOUTH TO AGE BEAUTY AND STRENGTH TO DECAY AND BRILLIANT INTELLECT TO THE EXHAUSTED BRAIN AND IF PROPERLY APPLIED PROTRACTING HUMAN EXISTENCE THROUGH COUNTLESS CENTURIES
4277-185519-0028 AS A PROOF OF ITS VIRTUES HE POINTED TO HIS OWN YOUTHFUL APPEARANCE AND THE TESTIMONY OF OLD MEN WHO HAD SEEN HIM SIXTY OR SEVENTY YEARS EARLIER AND WHO DECLARED THAT TIME HAD MADE NO IMPRESSION ON HIM
4277-185519-0029 STRANGELY ENOUGH THE MARGRAVE OF ANSPACH OF WHOM I SHALL PRESENTLY SPEAK PURCHASED WHAT PURPORTED TO BE THE RECIPE OF THE AQUA BENEDETTA FROM JOHN DYKE THE ENGLISH CONSUL AT LEGHORN TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE LAST CENTURY
4277-185519-0030 AND THE UTMOST SECRECY BY CERTAIN NOBLE FAMILIES IN BERLIN AND VIENNA WHERE THE PREPARATION HAS BEEN USED AS THEY BELIEVE WITH PERFECT SUCCESS AGAINST A HOST OF DISEASES STILL ANOTHER PECULIARITY OF THE COUNT
4277-185519-0031 WOULD BE HIGHLY ADVANTAGEOUS TO ANY OF US PARTICULARLY AT THIS PERIOD OF HIGH PRICES AND CULINARY SCARCITY HE NEVER ATE NOR DRANK OR AT LEAST HE WAS NEVER SEEN TO DO SO IT IS SAID THAT BOARDING HOUSE REGIME IN THESE DAYS
4277-185519-0032 IS RAPIDLY ACCUSTOMING A CONSIDERABLE CLASS OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS
4277-185519-0033 BUT I CAN SCARCELY BELIEVE IT AGAIN THE COUNT WOULD FALL INTO CATALEPTIC SWOONS WHICH CONTINUED OFTEN FOR HOURS AND EVEN DAYS AND DURING THESE PERIODS HE DECLARED THAT HE VISITED IN SPIRIT
4277-185519-0034 THE MOST REMOTE REGIONS OF THE EARTH AND EVEN THE FARTHEST STARS AND WOULD RELATE WITH ASTONISHING POWER THE SCENES HE THERE HAD WITNESSED HE OF COURSE
4277-185519-0035 LAID CLAIM TO THE TRANSMUTATION OF BASER METALS INTO GOLD AND STATED THAT IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY FIVE WHILE ON A VISIT TO INDIA TO CONSULT THE ERUDITION OF THE HINDOO BRAHMINS HE SOLVED BY THEIR ASSISTANCE THE PROBLEM OF THE ARTIFICIAL CRYSTALLIZATION OF PURE CARBON
4277-185519-0036 OR IN OTHER WORDS THE PRODUCTION OF DIAMONDS ONE THING IS CERTAIN VIZ THAT UPON A VISIT TO THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR TO THE HAGUE IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY HE IN THE PRESENCE OF THAT FUNCTIONARY INDUCED HIM TO BELIEVE AND TESTIFY
4277-185519-0037 THAT HE BROKE TO PIECES WITH A HAMMER A SUPERB DIAMOND OF HIS OWN MANUFACTURE THE EXACT COUNTERPART OF ANOTHER OF SIMILAR ORIGIN
4277-185519-0038 HIS CAREER AND TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE CONTINENT WERE MULTIFORM IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY TWO HE WAS MIXED UP WITH THE DYNASTIC CONSPIRACIES AND CHANGES AT SAINT PETERSBURG
4277-185519-0039 AND HIS IMPORTANCE THERE WAS INDICATED TEN YEARS LATER BY THE RECEPTION GIVEN TO HIM AT VIENNA BY THE RUSSIAN COUNT ORLOFF WHO ACCOSTED HIM JOYOUSLY AS CARO PADRE DEAR FATHER AND GAVE HIM TWENTY THOUSAND GOLDEN VENETIAN SEQUINS
4277-185519-0040 FROM PETERSBURG HE WENT TO BERLIN WHERE HE AT ONCE ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF FREDERICK THE GREAT WHO QUESTIONED VOLTAIRE ABOUT HIM THE LATTER REPLYING AS IT IS SAID THAT HE WAS A MAN WHO KNEW ALL THINGS
4277-185519-0041 AND WOULD LIVE TO THE END OF THE WORLD A FAIR STATEMENT IN BRIEF OF THE POSITION ASSUMED BY MORE THAN ONE OF OUR WARD POLITICIANS IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FOUR HE TOOK UP HIS ABODE AT SCHWABACH
4277-185519-0042 WHICH IS A TRANSPOSITION OF RAGOTZY A WELL KNOWN NOBLE NAME THE MARGRAVE OF ANSPACH MET HIM AT THE HOUSE OF HIS FAVORITE CLAIRON THE ACTRESS AND BECAME SO FOND OF HIM
4277-185519-0043 ON HIS RETURN HE WENT TO DRESDEN LEIPZIG AND HAMBURG AND FINALLY TO ECKERNFIORDE IN SCHLESWIG WHERE HE TOOK UP HIS RESIDENCE WITH THE LANDGRAVE KARL OF HESSE AND AT LENGTH IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE TIRED AS HE SAID OF LIFE
4277-185519-0044 AND DISDAINING ANY LONGER IMMORTALITY HE GAVE UP THE GHOST IT WAS DURING SAINT GERMAIN'S RESIDENCE IN SCHLESWIG
4277-185519-0045 WHO OPENLY ACKNOWLEDGED HIM AS MASTER AND LEARNED MANY OF HIS MOST PRECIOUS SECRETS FROM HIM AMONG OTHERS THE FACULTY OF DISCRIMINATING THE CHARACTER BY THE HANDWRITING AND OF FASCINATING BIRDS ANIMALS AND REPTILES
4277-185519-0046 AND OFTEN TOTALLY DISAPPEARED FOR MONTHS TOGETHER IN VENICE HE WAS KNOWN AS THE COUNT DE BELLAMARE AT PISA AS THE CHEVALIER DE SCHOENING AT MILAN AS THE CHEVALIER WELLDONE AT GENOA AS THE COUNT SOLTIKOW ET CETERA
