543-137106-0000 THEY INCLUDED DETECTIVE AND MISSUS GEORGE O MILLER AND FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO HAD GATHERED TO WITNESS THE BURIAL OF THE FORMER'S BRIGHT LITTLE SON HARRY AS THE CASKET RESTED UPON THE TRESTLES THERE WAS A PAINFUL PAUSE
543-137106-0001 BROKEN ONLY BY THE MOTHER'S SOBS UNTIL THE UNDERTAKER ADVANCED TOWARD A STOUT FLORID COMPLEXIONED GENTLEMAN IN THE PARTY AND WHISPERED TO HIM THE WORDS BEING INAUDIBLE TO THE LOOKERS ON
543-137106-0002 THIS GENTLEMAN WAS COLONEL ROBERT G INGERSOLL A FRIEND OF THE MILLERS WHO HAD ATTENDED THE FUNERAL AT THEIR REQUEST HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WHEN THE UNDERTAKER FIRST ADDRESSED HIM AND THEN SAID SUDDENLY DOES MISSUS MILLER DESIRE IT
543-137106-0003 THE UNDERTAKER GAVE AN AFFIRMATIVE NOD MISTER MILLER LOOKED APPEALINGLY TOWARD THE DISTINGUISHED ORATOR AND THEN COLONEL INGERSOLL ADVANCED TO THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE MADE A MOTION DENOTING A DESIRE FOR SILENCE
543-137106-0004 AND IN A VOICE OF EXQUISITE CADENCE DELIVERED ONE OF HIS CHARACTERISTIC EULOGIES FOR THE DEAD
543-137106-0005 THE SCENE WAS INTENSELY DRAMATIC A FINE DRIZZLING RAIN WAS FALLING AND EVERY HEAD WAS BENT AND EVERY EAR TURNED TO CATCH THE IMPASSIONED WORDS OF ELOQUENCE AND HOPE THAT FELL FROM THE LIPS OF THE FAMED ORATOR
543-137106-0006 COLONEL INGERSOLL WAS UNPROTECTED BY EITHER HAT OR UMBRELLA
543-137106-0007 BRIGHTENING AND SOBS BECOMING HUSHED THE COLONEL SAID MY FRIENDS I KNOW HOW VAIN IT IS TO GILD A GRIEF WITH WORDS AND YET I WISH TO TAKE FROM EVERY GRAVE ITS FEAR
543-137106-0008 HERE IN THIS WORLD WHERE LIFE AND DEATH ARE EQUAL KINGS ALL SHOULD BE BRAVE ENOUGH TO MEET WHAT ALL HAVE MET THE FUTURE HAS BEEN FILLED WITH FEAR STAINED AND POLLUTED BY THE HEARTLESS PAST
543-137106-0009 FROM THE WONDROUS TREE OF LIFE THE BUDS AND BLOSSOMS FALL WITH RIPENED FRUIT AND IN THE COMMON BED OF EARTH PATRIARCHS AND BABES SLEEP SIDE BY SIDE
543-137106-0010 WHY SHOULD WE FEAR THAT WHICH WILL COME TO ALL THAT IS WE CANNOT TELL WE DO NOT KNOW WHICH IS THE GREATEST BLESSING LIFE OR DEATH
543-137106-0011 WE CANNOT SAY THAT DEATH IS NOT GOOD WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THE GRAVE IS THE END OF THIS LIFE OR THE DOOR OF ANOTHER OR WHETHER THE NIGHT HERE IS NOT SOMEWHERE ELSE A DAWN
543-137106-0012 NEITHER CAN WE TELL WHICH IS THE MORE FORTUNATE THE CHILD DYING IN ITS MOTHER'S ARMS BEFORE ITS LIPS HAVE LEARNED TO FORM A WORD
543-137106-0013 OR HE WHO JOURNEYS ALL THE LENGTH OF LIFE'S UNEVEN ROAD PAINFULLY TAKING THE LAST SLOW STEPS WITH STAFF AND CRUTCH EVERY CRADLE ASKS US WHENCE AND EVERY COFFIN WHITHER
543-137106-0014 THE POOR BARBARIAN WEEPING ABOVE HIS DEAD CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION AS INTELLIGENTLY AND SATISFACTORILY AS THE ROBED PRIEST OF THE MOST AUTHENTIC CREED
543-137106-0015 THE TEARFUL IGNORANCE OF THE ONE IS JUST AS CONSOLING AS THE LEARNED AND UNMEANING WORDS OF THE OTHER
543-137106-0016 IT MAY BE THAT DEATH GIVES ALL THERE IS OF WORTH TO LIFE IF THOSE WHO PRESS AND STRAIN AGAINST OUR HEARTS COULD NEVER DIE PERHAPS THAT LOVE WOULD WITHER FROM THE EARTH
543-137106-0017 MAYBE A COMMON FAITH TREADS FROM OUT THE PATHS BETWEEN OUR HEARTS THE WEEDS OF SELFISHNESS AND I SHOULD RATHER LIVE AND LOVE WHERE DEATH IS KING THAN HAVE ETERNAL LIFE WHERE LOVE IS NOT
543-137106-0018 ANOTHER LIFE IS NAUGHT UNLESS WE KNOW AND LOVE AGAIN THE ONES WHO LOVE US HERE THEY WHO STAND WITH BREAKING HEARTS AROUND THIS LITTLE GRAVE NEED HAVE NO FEAR
543-137106-0019 THE LARGEST AND THE NOBLER FAITH IN ALL THAT IS AND IS TO BE TELLS US THAT DEATH EVEN AT ITS WORST IS ONLY PERFECT REST
543-137106-0020 ALMOST OF JOY THERE IS FOR THEM THIS CONSOLATION THE DEAD DO NOT SUFFER IF THEY LIVE AGAIN THEIR LIVES WILL SURELY BE AS GOOD AS OURS WE HAVE NO FEAR
543-137106-0021 AND THE SAME FATE AWAITS US ALL WE TOO HAVE OUR RELIGION AND IT IS THIS HELP FOR THE LIVING HOPE FOR THE DEAD
543-137106-0022 MOST EXQUISITE YET ONE OF THE MOST SAD AND MOURNFUL SERMONS THE FUNERAL OF
543-137106-0023 TOOK PLACE AT HIS RESIDENCE IN WASHINGTON D C JUNE SECOND EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE THE CEREMONIES WERE EXTREMELY SIMPLE CONSISTING MERELY OF VIEWING THE REMAINS BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS AND A FUNERAL ORATION BY COLONEL ROBERT G INGERSOLL
543-137106-0024 BROTHER OF THE DECEASED A LARGE NUMBER OF DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMEN WERE PRESENT INCLUDING SECRETARY SHERMAN ASSISTANT SECRETARY HAWLEY SENATORS BLAINE VORHEES PADDOCK ALLISON LOGAN
543-137106-0025 THE PALL BEARERS WERE SENATORS BLAINE VORHEES DAVID DAVIS PADDOCK AND ALLISON COLONEL WARD H LAMON HON JEREMIAH WILSON OF INDIANA AND HON THOMAS A BOYD OF ILLINOIS
543-137106-0026 SOON AFTER MISTER INGERSOLL BEGAN TO READ HIS ELOQUENT CHARACTERIZATION OF THE DEAD HIS EYES FILLED WITH TEARS HE TRIED TO HIDE THEM BEHIND HIS EYE GLASSES
543-137106-0027 BUT HE COULD NOT DO IT AND FINALLY HE BOWED HIS HEAD UPON THE DEAD MAN'S COFFIN IN UNCONTROLLABLE GRIEF IT WAS AFTER SOME DELAY AND THE GREATEST EFFORTS OF SELF MASTERY THAT COLONEL INGERSOLL WAS ABLE TO FINISH READING HIS ADDRESS
543-137106-0028 WHICH WAS AS FOLLOWS MY FRIENDS I AM GOING TO DO THAT WHICH THE DEAD OFTEN PROMISED HE WOULD DO FOR ME THE LOVED AND LOVING BROTHER HUSBAND FATHER FRIEND
543-137106-0029 DIED WHERE MANHOOD'S MORNING ALMOST TOUCHES NOON AND WHILE THE SHADOWS STILL WERE FALLING TOWARD THE WEST HE HAD NOT PASSED ON LIFE'S HIGHWAY THE STONE THAT MARKS THE HIGHEST POINT
543-137106-0030 BUT BEING WEARY FOR A MOMENT HE LAY DOWN BY THE WAYSIDE AND USING HIS BURDEN FOR A PILLOW FELL INTO THAT DREAMLESS SLEEP THAT KISSES DOWN HIS EYELIDS STILL
543-137106-0031 WHILE YET IN LOVE WITH LIFE AND RAPTURED WITH THE WORLD HE PASSED TO SILENCE AND PATHETIC DUST YET AFTER ALL IT MAY BE BEST
543-137106-0032 JUST IN THE HAPPIEST SUNNIEST HOUR OF ALL THE VOYAGE WHILE EAGER WINDS ARE KISSING EVERY SAIL TO DASH AGAINST THE UNSEEN ROCK AND IN AN INSTANT HEAR THE BILLOWS ROAR OVER A SUNKEN SHIP
543-137106-0033 FOR WHETHER IN MID SEA OR AMONG THE BREAKERS OF THE FARTHER SHORE A WRECK MUST MARK AT LAST THE END OF EACH AND ALL AND EVERY LIFE NO MATTER IF ITS EVERY HOUR IS RICH WITH LOVE
543-137106-0034 AND EVERY MOMENT JEWELED WITH A JOY WILL AT ITS CLOSE BECOME A TRAGEDY
543-137106-0035 THIS BRAVE AND TENDER MAN IN EVERY STORM OF LIFE WAS OAK AND ROCK BUT IN THE SUNSHINE HE WAS VINE AND FLOWER HE WAS THE FRIEND OF ALL HEROIC SOULS
543-137106-0036 HE CLIMBED THE HEIGHTS AND LEFT ALL SUPERSTITIONS FAR BELOW WHILE ON HIS FOREHEAD FELL THE GOLDEN DAWNING OF A GRANDER DAY HE LOVED THE BEAUTIFUL
543-137106-0037 HE SIDED WITH THE WEAK AND WITH A WILLING HAND GAVE ALMS WITH LOYAL HEART AND WITH THE PUREST HAND HE FAITHFUL DISCHARGED ALL PUBLIC TRUSTS HE WAS A WORSHIPER OF LIBERTY
543-137106-0038 AND A FRIEND OF THE OPPRESSED A THOUSAND TIMES I HAVE HEARD HIM QUOTE THE WORDS FOR JUSTICE ALL PLACE A TEMPLE AND ALL SEASON SUMMER HE BELIEVED THAT HAPPINESS WAS THE ONLY GOOD
543-137106-0039 REASON THE ONLY TORCH JUSTICE THE ONLY WORSHIPER HUMANITY THE ONLY RELIGION AND LOVE THE PRIEST HE ADDED TO THE SUM OF HUMAN JOY
543-137106-0040 BUT IN THE NIGHT OF DEATH HOPE SEES A STAR AND LISTENING LOVE CAN HEAR THE RUSTLE OF A WING HE WHO SLEEPS HERE WHEN DYING MISTAKING THE APPROACH OF DEATH FOR THE RETURN OF HEALTH
543-137106-0041 WHISPERED WITH HIS LATEST BREATH I AM BETTER NOW LET US BELIEVE IN SPITE OF DOUBTS AND DOGMAS AND TEARS AND FEARS THAT THESE DEAR WORDS
543-137106-0042 ARE TRUE OF ALL THE COUNTLESS DEAD AND NOW TO YOU WHO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN FROM AMONG THE MANY MEN HE LOVED TO DO THE LAST SAD OFFICE FOR THE DEAD WE GIVE HIS SACRED DUST
543-137106-0043 SPEECH CAN NOT CONTAIN OUR LOVE THERE WAS THERE IS NO GENTLER STRONGER
