3905-172165-0000 HAVING BEEN IT IS SAID OVERWHELMED BY THE OCEAN
3905-172165-0001 A FAIRY FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM AND DREW HIM AWAY BY ENCHANTMENT WHILE HE WAS ENGAGED IN HUNTING HIS QUEEN SET OUT IN QUEST OF HIM BUT WAS TAKEN ILL ON HER JOURNEY AND DIED LEAVING AN INFANT SON WHOM FROM THE MELANCHOLY CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS BIRTH
3905-172165-0002 SHE CALLED TRISTRAM GOUVERNAIL THE QUEEN'S SQUIRE WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED HER TOOK CHARGE OF THE CHILD AND RESTORED HIM TO HIS FATHER WHO HAD AT LENGTH BURST THE ENCHANTMENTS OF THE FAIRY AND RETURNED HOME
3905-172165-0003 AND THE NEW QUEEN BEING JEALOUS OF THE INFLUENCE OF TRISTRAM WITH HIS FATHER LAID PLOTS FOR HIS LIFE WHICH WERE DISCOVERED BY GOUVERNAIL WHO IN CONSEQUENCE FLED WITH THE BOY TO THE COURT OF THE KING OF FRANCE WHERE TRISTRAM WAS KINDLY RECEIVED
3905-172165-0004 AND GREW UP IMPROVING IN EVERY GALLANT AND KNIGHTLY ACCOMPLISHMENT ADDING TO HIS SKILL IN ARMS THE ARTS OF MUSIC AND OF CHESS IN PARTICULAR HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THE CHASE AND TO ALL WOODLAND SPORTS SO THAT HE BECAME DISTINGUISHED ABOVE ALL OTHER CHEVALIERS OF THE COURT
3905-172165-0005 FOR HIS KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THAT RELATES TO HUNTING NO WONDER THAT BELINDA THE KING'S DAUGHTER FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM BUT AS HE DID NOT RETURN HER PASSION SHE IN A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF ANGER EXCITED HER FATHER AGAINST HIM AND HE WAS BANISHED THE KINGDOM
3905-172165-0006 THE PRINCESS SOON REPENTED OF HER ACT AND IN DESPAIR DESTROYED HERSELF HAVING FIRST WRITTEN A MOST TENDER LETTER TO TRISTRAM SENDING HIM AT THE SAME TIME A BEAUTIFUL AND SAGACIOUS DOG OF WHICH SHE WAS VERY FOND DESIRING HIM TO KEEP IT AS A MEMORIAL OF HER
3905-172165-0007 AND AS HIS QUEEN TRISTRAM'S STEPMOTHER HELD THE THRONE
3905-172165-0008 AND TOOK HIM TO CORNWALL TO HIS UNCLE MARK WHO GAVE HIM A KIND RECEPTION KING MARK RESIDED AT THE CASTLE OF TINTADEL ALREADY MENTIONED IN THE HISTORY OF UTHER AND IGERNE IN THIS COURT
3905-172165-0009 TRISTRAM BECAME DISTINGUISHED IN ALL THE EXERCISES INCUMBENT ON A KNIGHT NOR WAS IT LONG BEFORE HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF PRACTICALLY EMPLOYING HIS VALOR AND SKILL MORAUNT A CELEBRATED CHAMPION BROTHER TO THE QUEEN OF IRELAND
3905-172165-0010 ARRIVED AT THE COURT TO DEMAND TRIBUTE OF KING MARK THE KNIGHTS OF CORNWALL ARE IN ILL REPUTE IN ROMANCE FOR THEIR COWARDICE AND THEY EXHIBITED IT ON THIS OCCASION KING MARK COULD FIND NO CHAMPION WHO DARED TO ENCOUNTER THE IRISH KNIGHT
3905-172165-0011 TILL HIS NEPHEW TRISTRAM WHO HAD NOT YET RECEIVED THE HONORS OF KNIGHTHOOD CRAVED TO BE ADMITTED TO THE ORDER OFFERING AT THE SAME TIME TO FIGHT THE BATTLE OF CORNWALL AGAINST THE IRISH CHAMPION KING MARK ASSENTED WITH RELUCTANCE
3905-172165-0012 TRISTRAM RECEIVED THE ACCOLADE WHICH CONFERRED KNIGHTHOOD UPON HIM AND THE PLACE AND TIME WERE ASSIGNED FOR THE ENCOUNTER WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO GIVE THE DETAILS OF THIS FAMOUS COMBAT THE FIRST AND ONE OF THE MOST GLORIOUS OF TRISTRAM'S EXPLOITS
3905-172165-0013 WE SHALL ONLY SAY THAT THE YOUNG KNIGHT THOUGH SEVERELY WOUNDED CLEFT THE HEAD OF MORAUNT LEAVING A PORTION OF HIS SWORD IN THE WOUND MORAUNT HALF DEAD WITH HIS WOUND AND THE DISGRACE OF HIS DEFEAT HASTENED TO HIDE HIMSELF IN HIS SHIP
3905-172165-0014 SAILED AWAY WITH ALL SPEED FOR IRELAND AND DIED SOON AFTER ARRIVING IN HIS OWN COUNTRY THE KINGDOM OF CORNWALL WAS THUS DELIVERED FROM ITS TRIBUTE TRISTRAM WEAKENED BY LOSS OF BLOOD FELL SENSELESS
3905-172165-0015 HIS FRIENDS FLEW TO HIS ASSISTANCE THEY DRESSED HIS WOUNDS WHICH IN GENERAL HEALED READILY BUT THE LANCE OF MORAUNT WAS POISONED AND ONE WOUND WHICH IT MADE YIELDED TO NO REMEDIES BUT GREW WORSE DAY BY DAY THE SURGEONS COULD DO NO MORE
3905-172165-0016 TRISTRAM ASKED PERMISSION OF HIS UNCLE TO DEPART AND SEEK FOR AID IN THE KINGDOM OF LOEGRIA ENGLAND WITH HIS CONSENT HE EMBARKED AND AFTER TOSSING FOR MANY DAYS ON THE SEA WAS DRIVEN BY THE WINDS TO THE COAST OF IRELAND HE LANDED
3905-172165-0017 FULL OF JOY AND GRATITUDE THAT HE HAD ESCAPED THE PERIL OF THE SEA
3905-172165-0018 AND BEGAN TO PLAY IT WAS A SUMMER EVENING AND THE KING OF IRELAND AND HIS DAUGHTER
3905-172165-0019 WERE AT A WINDOW WHICH OVERLOOKED THE SEA THE STRANGE HARPER WAS SENT FOR AND CONVEYED TO THE PALACE WHERE FINDING THAT HE WAS IN IRELAND WHOSE CHAMPION HE HAD LATELY SLAIN HE CONCEALED HIS NAME AND CALLED HIMSELF TRAMTRIS
3905-172165-0020 THE QUEEN UNDERTOOK HIS CURE AND BY A MEDICATED BATH GRADUALLY RESTORED HIM TO HEALTH HIS SKILL IN MUSIC AND IN GAMES OCCASIONED HIS BEING FREQUENTLY CALLED TO COURT
3905-172165-0021 WHO PROFITED SO WELL UNDER HIS CARE THAT SHE SOON HAD NO EQUAL IN THE KINGDOM EXCEPT HER INSTRUCTOR AT THIS TIME A TOURNAMENT WAS HELD AT WHICH MANY KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE AND OTHERS WERE PRESENT
3905-172165-0022 ON THE FIRST DAY A SARACEN PRINCE NAMED PALAMEDES OBTAINED THE ADVANTAGE OVER ALL THEY BROUGHT HIM TO THE COURT AND GAVE HIM A FEAST AT WHICH TRISTRAM JUST RECOVERING FROM HIS WOUND WAS PRESENT
3905-172165-0023 PALAMEDES COULD NOT BEHOLD THEM WITHOUT EMOTION AND MADE NO EFFORT TO CONCEAL HIS LOVE TRISTRAM PERCEIVED IT AND THE PAIN HE FELT FROM JEALOUSY TAUGHT HIM HOW DEAR THE FAIR ISOUDE HAD ALREADY BECOME TO HIM NEXT DAY THE TOURNAMENT WAS RENEWED
3905-172165-0024 TRISTRAM STILL FEEBLE FROM HIS WOUND ROSE DURING THE NIGHT TOOK HIS ARMS AND CONCEALED THEM IN A FOREST NEAR THE PLACE OF THE CONTEST AND AFTER IT HAD BEGUN MINGLED WITH THE COMBATANTS HE OVERTHREW ALL THAT ENCOUNTERED HIM IN PARTICULAR PALAMEDES
3905-172165-0025 WHOM HE BROUGHT TO THE GROUND WITH A STROKE OF HIS LANCE AND THEN FOUGHT HIM HAND TO HAND BEARING OFF THE PRIZE OF THE TOURNEY BUT HIS EXERTIONS CAUSED HIS WOUND TO REOPEN HE BLED FAST AND IN THIS SAD STATE YET IN TRIUMPH THEY BORE HIM TO THE PALACE
3905-172165-0026 THE FAIR ISOUDE DEVOTED HERSELF TO HIS RELIEF WITH AN INTEREST WHICH GREW MORE VIVID DAY BY DAY AND HER SKILFUL CARE SOON RESTORED HIM TO HEALTH IT HAPPENED ONE DAY THAT A DAMSEL OF THE COURT ENTERING THE CLOSET WHERE TRISTRAM'S ARMS WERE DEPOSITED
3905-172165-0027 PERCEIVED THAT A PART OF THE SWORD HAD BEEN BROKEN OFF IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT THE MISSING PORTION WAS LIKE THAT WHICH WAS LEFT IN THE SKULL OF MORAUNT THE IRISH CHAMPION SHE IMPARTED HER THOUGHT TO THE QUEEN
3905-172165-0028 WHO COMPARED THE FRAGMENT TAKEN FROM HER BROTHER'S WOUND WITH THE SWORD OF TRISTRAM AND WAS SATISFIED THAT IT WAS PART OF THE SAME AND THAT THE WEAPON OF TRISTRAM WAS THAT WHICH REFT HER BROTHER'S LIFE SHE LAID HER GRIEFS AND RESENTMENT BEFORE THE KING
3905-172165-0029 WHO SATISFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN EYES OF THE TRUTH OF HER SUSPICIONS TRISTRAM WAS CITED BEFORE THE WHOLE COURT AND REPROACHED WITH HAVING DARED TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THEM AFTER HAVING SLAIN THEIR KINSMAN
3905-172165-0030 HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD FOUGHT WITH MORAUNT TO SETTLE THE CLAIM FOR TRIBUTE AND SAID THAT IT WAS BY FORCE OF WINDS AND WAVES ALONE THAT HE WAS THROWN ON THEIR COAST THE QUEEN DEMANDED VENGEANCE FOR THE DEATH OF HER BROTHER
3905-172165-0031 BUT A MURMUR ROSE FROM ALL THE ASSEMBLY THAT THE LIFE OF ONE SO HANDSOME AND SO BRAVE SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN FOR SUCH A CAUSE AND GENEROSITY FINALLY TRIUMPHED OVER RESENTMENT IN THE MIND OF THE KING
3905-172165-0032 TRISTRAM WAS DISMISSED IN SAFETY BUT COMMANDED TO LEAVE THE KINGDOM WITHOUT DELAY AND NEVER TO RETURN THITHER UNDER PAIN OF DEATH TRISTRAM WENT BACK WITH RESTORED HEALTH TO CORNWALL
3905-172165-0033 KING MARK MADE HIS NEPHEW GIVE HIM A MINUTE RECITAL OF HIS ADVENTURES TRISTRAM TOLD HIM ALL MINUTELY BUT WHEN HE CAME TO SPEAK OF THE FAIR ISOUDE HE DESCRIBED HER CHARMS WITH A WARMTH AND ENERGY SUCH AS NONE BUT A LOVER COULD DISPLAY
3905-172165-0034 KING MARK WAS FASCINATED WITH THE DESCRIPTION AND CHOOSING A FAVORABLE TIME DEMANDED A BOON FOOTNOTE GOOD FAITH WAS THE VERY CORNER STONE OF CHIVALRY WHENEVER A KNIGHT'S WORD WAS PLEDGED IT MATTERED NOT HOW RASHLY
3905-172165-0035 HENCE THE SACRED OBLIGATION OF THE BOON GRANTED BY A KNIGHT TO HIS SUPPLIANT INSTANCES WITHOUT NUMBER OCCUR IN ROMANCE IN WHICH A KNIGHT BY RASHLY GRANTING AN INDEFINITE BOON WAS OBLIGED TO DO OR SUFFER SOMETHING EXTREMELY TO HIS PREJUDICE
3905-172165-0036 BUT IT IS NOT IN ROMANCE ALONE THAT WE FIND SUCH SINGULAR INSTANCES OF ADHERENCE TO AN INDEFINITE PROMISE THE HISTORY OF THE TIMES PRESENTS AUTHENTIC TRANSACTIONS EQUALLY EMBARRASSING AND ABSURD SCOTT NOTE TO SIR TRISTRAM
3905-172165-0037 OF HIS NEPHEW WHO READILY GRANTED IT THE KING MADE HIM SWEAR UPON THE HOLY RELIQUES THAT HE WOULD FULFIL HIS COMMANDS THEN MARK DIRECTED HIM TO GO TO IRELAND
3905-172165-0038 TRISTRAM BELIEVED IT WAS CERTAIN DEATH FOR HIM TO RETURN TO IRELAND AND HOW COULD HE ACT AS AMBASSADOR FOR HIS UNCLE IN SUCH A CAUSE YET BOUND BY HIS OATH HE HESITATED NOT FOR AN INSTANT HE ONLY TOOK THE PRECAUTION TO CHANGE HIS ARMOR
3905-172165-0039 HE EMBARKED FOR IRELAND BUT A TEMPEST DROVE HIM TO THE COAST OF ENGLAND NEAR CAMELOT WHERE KING ARTHUR WAS HOLDING HIS COURT ATTENDED BY THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE AND MANY OTHERS THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS IN THE WORLD TRISTRAM KEPT HIMSELF UNKNOWN
3905-172165-0040 HE TOOK PART IN MANY JUSTS HE FOUGHT MANY COMBATS IN WHICH HE COVERED HIMSELF WITH GLORY ONE DAY HE SAW AMONG THOSE RECENTLY ARRIVED THE KING OF IRELAND FATHER OF THE FAIR ISOUDE
3905-172165-0041 THIS PRINCE ACCUSED OF TREASON AGAINST HIS LIEGE SOVEREIGN ARTHUR CAME TO CAMELOT TO FREE HIMSELF FROM THE CHARGE BLAANOR ONE OF THE MOST REDOUBTABLE WARRIORS OF THE ROUND TABLE WAS HIS ACCUSER AND ARGIUS THE KING
3905-172165-0042 HAD NEITHER YOUTHFUL VIGOR NOR STRENGTH TO ENCOUNTER HIM HE MUST THEREFORE SEEK A CHAMPION TO SUSTAIN HIS INNOCENCE BUT THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE WERE NOT AT LIBERTY TO FIGHT AGAINST ONE ANOTHER UNLESS IN A QUARREL OF THEIR OWN
3905-172165-0043 ARGIUS HEARD OF THE GREAT RENOWN OF THE UNKNOWN KNIGHT HE ALSO WAS WITNESS OF HIS EXPLOITS HE SOUGHT HIM AND CONJURED HIM TO ADOPT HIS DEFENCE AND ON HIS OATH DECLARED THAT HE WAS INNOCENT OF THE CRIME OF WHICH HE WAS ACCUSED
3905-172165-0044 TRISTRAM READILY CONSENTED AND MADE HIMSELF KNOWN TO THE KING WHO ON HIS PART PROMISED TO REWARD HIS EXERTIONS IF SUCCESSFUL WITH WHATEVER GIFT HE MIGHT ASK TRISTRAM FOUGHT WITH BLAANOR AND OVERTHREW HIM
3905-172165-0045 AND HELD HIS LIFE IN HIS POWER THE FALLEN WARRIOR CALLED ON HIM TO USE HIS RIGHT OF CONQUEST AND STRIKE THE FATAL BLOW GOD FORBID SAID TRISTRAM THAT I SHOULD TAKE THE LIFE OF SO BRAVE A KNIGHT HE RAISED HIM UP AND RESTORED HIM TO HIS FRIENDS
3905-172165-0046 THE JUDGES OF THE FIELD DECIDED THAT THE KING OF IRELAND WAS ACQUITTED OF THE CHARGE AGAINST HIM AND THEY LED TRISTRAM IN TRIUMPH TO HIS TENT KING ARGIUS FULL OF GRATITUDE CONJURED TRISTRAM TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO HIS KINGDOM THEY DEPARTED TOGETHER AND ARRIVED IN IRELAND
3905-172165-0047 AND THE QUEEN FORGETTING HER RESENTMENT FOR HER BROTHER'S DEATH EXHIBITED TO THE PRESERVER OF HER HUSBAND'S LIFE NOTHING BUT GRATITUDE AND GOOD WILL HOW HAPPY A MOMENT FOR ISOUDE WHO KNEW THAT HER FATHER HAD PROMISED HIS DELIVERER
3905-172165-0048 WHATEVER BOON HE MIGHT ASK BUT THE UNHAPPY TRISTRAM GAZED ON HER WITH DESPAIR AT THE THOUGHT OF THE CRUEL OATH WHICH BOUND HIM HIS MAGNANIMOUS SOUL SUBDUED THE FORCE OF HIS LOVE
3905-172165-0049 ARGIUS CONSENTED AND SOON ALL WAS PREPARED FOR THE DEPARTURE OF ISOUDE BRENGWAIN HER FAVORITE MAID OF HONOR WAS TO ACCOMPANY HER ON THE DAY OF DEPARTURE THE QUEEN TOOK ASIDE THIS DEVOTED ATTENDANT
3905-172165-0050 AND TOLD HER THAT SHE HAD OBSERVED THAT HER DAUGHTER AND TRISTRAM WERE ATTACHED TO ONE ANOTHER AND THAT TO AVERT THE BAD EFFECTS OF THIS INCLINATION SHE HAD PROCURED FROM A POWERFUL FAIRY A POTENT PHILTER LOVE DRAUGHT
3905-172165-0051 AND TO KING MARK ON THE EVENING OF THEIR MARRIAGE
3905-172165-0052 A FAVORABLE WIND FILLED THE SAILS AND PROMISED THEM A FORTUNATE VOYAGE THE LOVERS GAZED UPON ONE ANOTHER AND COULD NOT REPRESS THEIR SIGHS LOVE SEEMED TO LIGHT UP ALL HIS FIRES ON THEIR LIPS AS IN THEIR HEARTS
3905-172165-0053 THE DAY WAS WARM THEY SUFFERED FROM THIRST ISOUDE FIRST COMPLAINED TRISTRAM DESCRIED THE BOTTLE CONTAINING THE LOVE DRAUGHT WHICH BRENGWAIN HAD BEEN SO IMPRUDENT AS TO LEAVE IN SIGHT HE TOOK IT
3905-172165-0054 GAVE SOME OF IT TO THE CHARMING ISOUDE AND DRANK THE REMAINDER HIMSELF THE DOG HOUDAIN LICKED THE CUP
3905-172165-0055 THE OLD MONARCH WAS DELIGHTED WITH HIS BRIDE AND HIS GRATITUDE TO TRISTRAM WAS UNBOUNDED HE LOADED HIM WITH HONORS AND MADE HIM CHAMBERLAIN OF HIS PALACE THUS GIVING HIM ACCESS TO THE QUEEN AT ALL TIMES
3905-172165-0056 IN THE MIDST OF THE FESTIVITIES OF THE COURT WHICH FOLLOWED THE ROYAL MARRIAGE AN UNKNOWN MINSTREL ONE DAY PRESENTED HIMSELF BEARING A HARP OF PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION
3905-172165-0057 HE EXCITED THE CURIOSITY OF KING MARK BY REFUSING TO PLAY UPON IT TILL HE SHOULD GRANT HIM A BOON THE KING HAVING PROMISED TO GRANT HIS REQUEST THE MINSTREL WHO WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE SARACEN KNIGHT SIR PALAMEDES THE LOVER OF THE FAIR ISOUDE
3905-172165-0058 KING MARK COULD NOT BY THE LAWS OF KNIGHTHOOD WITHHOLD THE BOON THE LADY WAS MOUNTED ON HER HORSE AND LED AWAY BY HER TRIUMPHANT LOVER TRISTRAM IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY WAS ABSENT AT THE TIME AND DID NOT RETURN UNTIL THEIR DEPARTURE
3905-172165-0059 WHEN HE HEARD WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE HE SEIZED HIS ROTE AND HASTENED TO THE SHORE WHERE ISOUDE AND HER NEW MASTER HAD ALREADY EMBARKED TRISTRAM PLAYED UPON HIS ROTE AND THE SOUND REACHED THE EARS OF ISOUDE WHO BECAME SO DEEPLY AFFECTED
3905-172165-0060 THAT SIR PALAMEDES WAS INDUCED TO RETURN WITH HER TO LAND THAT THEY MIGHT SEE THE UNKNOWN MUSICIAN TRISTRAM WATCHED HIS OPPORTUNITY SEIZED THE LADY'S HORSE BY THE BRIDLE AND PLUNGED WITH HER INTO THE FOREST TAUNTINGLY INFORMING HIS RIVAL THAT
3905-172165-0061 WHAT HE HAD GOT BY THE HARP HE HAD LOST BY THE ROTE PALAMEDES PURSUED AND A COMBAT WAS ABOUT TO COMMENCE
3905-172165-0062 AND ADDRESSING PALAMEDES SAID YOU TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME YOU WILL NOT THEN DENY ME THE REQUEST I AM ABOUT TO MAKE LADY HE REPLIED I WILL PERFORM YOUR BIDDING LEAVE THEN SAID SHE THIS CONTEST
3905-172165-0063 AND REPAIR TO KING ARTHUR'S COURT
3905-172165-0064 TELL HER THAT THERE ARE IN THE WORLD BUT TWO LADIES HERSELF AND I AND TWO LOVERS HERS AND MINE AND COME THOU NOT IN FUTURE IN ANY PLACE WHERE I AM PALAMEDES BURST INTO TEARS AH LADY SAID HE
3905-172165-0065 I WILL OBEY YOU BUT I BESEECH YOU THAT YOU WILL NOT FOR EVER STEEL YOUR HEART AGAINST ME PALAMEDES SHE REPLIED MAY I NEVER TASTE OF JOY AGAIN IF I EVER QUIT MY FIRST LOVE PALAMEDES THEN WENT HIS WAY THE LOVERS REMAINED A WEEK IN CONCEALMENT
3905-172165-0066 ADVISING HIM IN FUTURE TO REWARD MINSTRELS IN SOME OTHER WAY THE KING SHOWED MUCH GRATITUDE TO TRISTRAM BUT IN THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART HE CHERISHED BITTER JEALOUSY OF HIM
3905-172165-0067 ONE DAY TRISTRAM AND ISOUDE WERE ALONE TOGETHER IN HER PRIVATE CHAMBER A BASE AND COWARDLY KNIGHT OF THE COURT NAMED ANDRET SPIED THEM THROUGH A KEYHOLE THEY SAT AT A TABLE OF CHESS BUT WERE NOT ATTENDING TO THE GAME
3905-172165-0068 ANDRET BROUGHT THE KING HAVING FIRST RAISED HIS SUSPICIONS AND PLACED HIM SO AS TO WATCH THEIR MOTIONS THE KING SAW ENOUGH TO CONFIRM HIS SUSPICIONS AND HE BURST INTO THE APARTMENT WITH HIS SWORD DRAWN
3905-172165-0069 AND HAD NEARLY SLAIN TRISTRAM BEFORE HE WAS PUT ON HIS GUARD BUT TRISTRAM AVOIDED THE BLOW DREW HIS SWORD AND DROVE BEFORE HIM THE COWARDLY MONARCH CHASING HIM THROUGH ALL THE APARTMENTS OF THE PALACE GIVING HIM FREQUENT BLOWS WITH THE FLAT OF HIS SWORD
3905-172165-0070 WHILE HE CRIED IN VAIN TO HIS KNIGHTS TO SAVE HIM THEY WERE NOT INCLINED OR DID NOT DARE TO INTERPOSE IN HIS BEHALF A PROOF OF THE GREAT POPULARITY OF THE TALE OF SIR TRISTRAM IS THE FACT THAT THE ITALIAN POETS
3905-172165-0071 BOIARDO AND ARIOSTO HAVE FOUNDED UPON IT THE IDEA OF THE TWO ENCHANTED FOUNTAINS WHICH PRODUCED THE OPPOSITE EFFECTS OF LOVE AND HATRED BOIARDO THUS DESCRIBES THE FOUNTAIN OF HATRED
3905-172165-0072 FAIR WAS THAT FOUNTAIN SCULPTURED ALL OF GOLD WITH ALABASTER SCULPTURED RICH AND RARE AND IN ITS BASIN CLEAR THOU MIGHT'ST BEHOLD THE FLOWERY MARGE REFLECTED FRESH AND FAIR
3905-172165-0073 SAGE MERLIN FRAMED THE FONT SO LEGENDS BEAR WHEN ON FAIR ISOUDE DOATED TRISTRAM BRAVE THAT THE GOOD ERRANT KNIGHT ARRIVING THERE
3905-172165-0074 AND LEAVE HIS LUCKLESS LOVE AND SCAPE HIS TIMELESS GRAVE BUT NE'ER THE WARRIOR'S EVIL FATE ALLOWED HIS STEPS THAT FOUNTAIN'S CHARMED VERGE TO GAIN
3905-172165-0075 THOUGH RESTLESS ROVING ON ADVENTURE PROUD
