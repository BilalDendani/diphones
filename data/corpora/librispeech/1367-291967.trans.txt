1367-291967-0026 AT THE MID HOUR OF NIGHT WHEN STARS ARE WEEPING I FLY TO THE LONE VALE WE LOVED WHEN LIFE SHONE WARM IN THINE EYE AND I THINK OFT IF SPIRITS CAN STEAL FROM THE REGIONS OF AIR
1367-291967-0027 TO REVISIT PAST SCENES OF DELIGHT THOU WILT COME TO ME THERE AND TELL ME OUR LOVE IS REMEMBER'D EVEN IN THE SKY THEN I SING THE WILD SONG IT ONCE WAS RAPTURE TO HEAR
1367-291967-0028 WHEN OUR VOICES COMMINGLING BREATHED LIKE ONE ON THE EAR AND AS ECHO FAR OFF THROUGH THE VALE MY SAD ORISON ROLLS I THINK O MY LOVE TIS THY VOICE FROM THE KINGDOM OF SOULS
