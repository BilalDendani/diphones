6574-70753-0000 SOME TIME ELAPSED BEFORE I LEARNED THE HISTORY OF MY FRIENDS IT WAS ONE WHICH COULD NOT FAIL TO IMPRESS ITSELF DEEPLY ON MY MIND UNFOLDING AS IT DID A NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES
6574-70753-0001 EACH INTERESTING AND WONDERFUL TO ONE SO UTTERLY INEXPERIENCED AS I WAS THE NAME OF THE OLD MAN WAS DE LACEY HE WAS DESCENDED FROM A GOOD FAMILY IN FRANCE WHERE HE HAD LIVED FOR MANY YEARS IN AFFLUENCE
6574-70753-0002 RESPECTED BY HIS SUPERIORS AND BELOVED BY HIS EQUALS HIS SON WAS BRED IN THE SERVICE OF HIS COUNTRY AND AGATHA HAD RANKED WITH LADIES OF THE HIGHEST DISTINCTION
6574-70753-0003 A FEW MONTHS BEFORE MY ARRIVAL THEY HAD LIVED IN A LARGE AND LUXURIOUS CITY CALLED PARIS SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS AND POSSESSED OF EVERY ENJOYMENT WHICH VIRTUE REFINEMENT OF INTELLECT OR TASTE ACCOMPANIED BY A MODERATE FORTUNE COULD AFFORD
6574-70753-0004 HE WAS A TURKISH MERCHANT AND HAD INHABITED PARIS FOR MANY YEARS WHEN FOR SOME REASON WHICH I COULD NOT LEARN
6574-70753-0005 HE WAS TRIED AND CONDEMNED TO DEATH THE INJUSTICE OF HIS SENTENCE WAS VERY FLAGRANT ALL PARIS WAS INDIGNANT AND IT WAS JUDGED THAT HIS RELIGION AND WEALTH RATHER THAN THE CRIME ALLEGED AGAINST HIM HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF HIS CONDEMNATION
6574-70753-0006 FELIX HAD ACCIDENTALLY BEEN PRESENT AT THE TRIAL HIS HORROR AND INDIGNATION WERE UNCONTROLLABLE WHEN HE HEARD THE DECISION OF THE COURT
6574-70753-0007 AND THEN LOOKED AROUND FOR THE MEANS AFTER MANY FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS TO GAIN ADMITTANCE TO THE PRISON HE FOUND A STRONGLY GRATED WINDOW IN AN UNGUARDED PART OF THE BUILDING WHICH LIGHTED THE DUNGEON OF THE UNFORTUNATE MUHAMMADAN
6574-70753-0008 WAITED IN DESPAIR THE EXECUTION OF THE BARBAROUS SENTENCE FELIX VISITED THE GRATE AT NIGHT AND MADE KNOWN TO THE PRISONER HIS INTENTIONS IN HIS FAVOUR THE TURK AMAZED AND DELIGHTED ENDEAVOURED TO KINDLE THE ZEAL OF HIS DELIVERER
6574-70753-0009 BY PROMISES OF REWARD AND WEALTH FELIX REJECTED HIS OFFERS WITH CONTEMPT
6574-70753-0010 WHO WAS ALLOWED TO VISIT HER FATHER AND WHO BY HER GESTURES EXPRESSED HER LIVELY GRATITUDE
6574-70753-0011 THE TURK QUICKLY PERCEIVED THE IMPRESSION THAT HIS DAUGHTER HAD MADE ON THE HEART OF FELIX AND ENDEAVOURED TO SECURE HIM MORE ENTIRELY IN HIS INTERESTS BY THE PROMISE OF HER HAND IN MARRIAGE SO SOON AS HE SHOULD BE CONVEYED TO A PLACE OF SAFETY FELIX WAS TOO DELICATE TO ACCEPT THIS OFFER
6574-70753-0012 DURING THE ENSUING DAYS WHILE THE PREPARATIONS WERE GOING FORWARD FOR THE ESCAPE OF THE MERCHANT THE ZEAL OF FELIX WAS WARMED BY SEVERAL LETTERS THAT HE RECEIVED FROM THIS LOVELY GIRL
6574-70753-0013 WHO FOUND MEANS TO EXPRESS HER THOUGHTS IN THE LANGUAGE OF HER LOVER BY THE AID OF AN OLD MAN A SERVANT OF HER FATHER WHO UNDERSTOOD FRENCH SHE THANKED HIM IN THE MOST ARDENT TERMS FOR HIS INTENDED SERVICES TOWARDS HER PARENT
6574-70753-0014 AND AT THE SAME TIME SHE GENTLY DEPLORED HER OWN FATE I HAVE COPIES OF THESE LETTERS FOR I FOUND MEANS DURING MY RESIDENCE IN THE HOVEL TO PROCURE THE IMPLEMENTS OF WRITING AND THE LETTERS WERE OFTEN IN THE HANDS OF FELIX OR AGATHA
6574-70753-0015 BEFORE I DEPART I WILL GIVE THEM TO YOU THEY WILL PROVE THE TRUTH OF MY TALE BUT AT PRESENT AS THE SUN IS ALREADY FAR DECLINED I SHALL ONLY HAVE TIME TO REPEAT THE SUBSTANCE OF THEM TO YOU
6574-70753-0016 SEIZED AND MADE A SLAVE BY THE TURKS
6574-70753-0017 THE YOUNG GIRL SPOKE IN HIGH AND ENTHUSIASTIC TERMS OF HER MOTHER WHO BORN IN FREEDOM SPURNED THE BONDAGE TO WHICH SHE WAS NOW REDUCED SHE INSTRUCTED HER DAUGHTER IN THE TENETS OF HER RELIGION
6574-70753-0018 AND TAUGHT HER TO ASPIRE TO HIGHER POWERS OF INTELLECT AND AN INDEPENDENCE OF SPIRIT FORBIDDEN TO THE FEMALE FOLLOWERS OF MUHAMMAD THIS LADY DIED BUT HER LESSONS WERE INDELIBLY IMPRESSED ON THE MIND OF SAFIE WHO SICKENED AT THE PROSPECT OF AGAIN RETURNING TO ASIA
6574-70753-0019 AND BEING IMMURED WITHIN THE WALLS OF A HAREM ALLOWED ONLY TO OCCUPY HERSELF WITH INFANTILE AMUSEMENTS ILL SUITED TO THE TEMPER OF HER SOUL NOW ACCUSTOMED TO GRAND IDEAS AND A NOBLE EMULATION FOR VIRTUE
6574-70753-0020 THE PROSPECT OF MARRYING A CHRISTIAN AND REMAINING IN A COUNTRY WHERE WOMEN WERE ALLOWED TO TAKE A RANK IN SOCIETY WAS ENCHANTING TO HER THE DAY FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE TURK WAS FIXED BUT ON THE NIGHT PREVIOUS TO IT HE QUITTED HIS PRISON
6574-70753-0021 AND BEFORE MORNING WAS DISTANT MANY LEAGUES FROM PARIS
6574-70753-0022 WHERE THE MERCHANT HAD DECIDED TO WAIT A FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY OF PASSING INTO SOME PART OF THE TURKISH DOMINIONS
6574-70753-0023 BEFORE WHICH TIME THE TURK RENEWED HIS PROMISE THAT SHE SHOULD BE UNITED TO HIS DELIVERER AND FELIX REMAINED WITH THEM IN EXPECTATION OF THAT EVENT AND IN THE MEANTIME HE ENJOYED THE SOCIETY OF THE ARABIAN
6574-70753-0024 WHO EXHIBITED TOWARDS HIM THE SIMPLEST AND TENDEREST AFFECTION THEY CONVERSED WITH ONE ANOTHER THROUGH THE MEANS OF AN INTERPRETER AND SOMETIMES WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF LOOKS
6574-70753-0025 WHILE IN HIS HEART HE HAD FORMED FAR OTHER PLANS HE LOATHED THE IDEA THAT HIS DAUGHTER SHOULD BE UNITED TO A CHRISTIAN BUT HE FEARED THE RESENTMENT OF FELIX IF HE SHOULD APPEAR LUKEWARM
6574-70753-0026 IF HE SHOULD CHOOSE TO BETRAY HIM TO THE ITALIAN STATE WHICH THEY INHABITED HE REVOLVED A THOUSAND PLANS BY WHICH HE SHOULD BE ENABLED TO PROLONG THE DECEIT UNTIL IT MIGHT BE NO LONGER NECESSARY
6574-70753-0027 AND SECRETLY TO TAKE HIS DAUGHTER WITH HIM WHEN HE DEPARTED HIS PLANS WERE FACILITATED BY THE NEWS WHICH ARRIVED FROM PARIS THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE WERE GREATLY ENRAGED AT THE ESCAPE OF THEIR VICTIM
6574-70753-0028 AND SPARED NO PAINS TO DETECT AND PUNISH HIS DELIVERER THE PLOT OF FELIX WAS QUICKLY DISCOVERED AND DE LACEY AND AGATHA WERE THROWN INTO PRISON THE NEWS REACHED FELIX AND ROUSED HIM FROM HIS DREAM OF PLEASURE
6574-70753-0029 HIS BLIND AND AGED FATHER AND HIS GENTLE SISTER LAY IN A NOISOME DUNGEON WHILE HE ENJOYED THE FREE AIR AND THE SOCIETY OF HER WHOM HE LOVED THIS IDEA WAS TORTURE TO HIM
6574-70753-0030 HE QUICKLY ARRANGED WITH THE TURK THAT IF THE LATTER SHOULD FIND A FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR ESCAPE BEFORE FELIX COULD RETURN TO ITALY SAFIE SHOULD REMAIN AS A BOARDER AT A CONVENT AT LEGHORN
6574-70753-0031 AND THEN QUITTING THE LOVELY ARABIAN HE HASTENED TO PARIS AND DELIVERED HIMSELF UP TO THE VENGEANCE OF THE LAW HOPING TO FREE DE LACEY AND AGATHA BY THIS PROCEEDING
6574-70753-0032 THEY REMAINED CONFINED FOR FIVE MONTHS BEFORE THE TRIAL TOOK PLACE THE RESULT OF WHICH DEPRIVED THEM OF THEIR FORTUNE AND CONDEMNED THEM TO A PERPETUAL EXILE FROM THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY THEY FOUND A MISERABLE ASYLUM IN THE COTTAGE IN GERMANY WHERE I DISCOVERED THEM
6574-70753-0033 SUCH WERE THE EVENTS THAT PREYED ON THE HEART OF FELIX AND RENDERED HIM WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM THE MOST MISERABLE OF HIS FAMILY HE COULD HAVE ENDURED POVERTY AND WHILE THIS DISTRESS HAD BEEN THE MEED OF HIS VIRTUE HE GLORIED IN IT
6574-70753-0034 THE ARRIVAL OF THE ARABIAN NOW INFUSED NEW LIFE INTO HIS SOUL WHEN THE NEWS REACHED LEGHORN THAT FELIX WAS DEPRIVED OF HIS WEALTH AND RANK THE MERCHANT COMMANDED HIS DAUGHTER TO THINK NO MORE OF HER LOVER BUT TO PREPARE TO RETURN TO HER NATIVE COUNTRY
6574-70753-0035 SHE ATTEMPTED TO EXPOSTULATE WITH HER FATHER BUT HE LEFT HER ANGRILY REITERATING HIS TYRANNICAL MANDATE A FEW DAYS AFTER THE TURK ENTERED HIS DAUGHTER'S APARTMENT
6574-70753-0036 AND TOLD HER HASTILY THAT HE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HIS RESIDENCE AT LEGHORN HAD BEEN DIVULGED AND THAT HE SHOULD SPEEDILY BE DELIVERED UP TO THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT HE HAD CONSEQUENTLY HIRED A VESSEL TO CONVEY HIM TO CONSTANTINOPLE
6574-70753-0037 FOR WHICH CITY HE SHOULD SAIL IN A FEW HOURS HE INTENDED TO LEAVE HIS DAUGHTER UNDER THE CARE OF A CONFIDENTIAL SERVANT TO FOLLOW AT HER LEISURE WITH THE GREATER PART OF HIS PROPERTY WHICH HAD NOT YET ARRIVED AT LEGHORN WHEN ALONE
6574-70753-0038 THAT IT WOULD BECOME HER TO PURSUE IN THIS EMERGENCY A RESIDENCE IN TURKEY WAS ABHORRENT TO HER HER RELIGION AND HER FEELINGS WERE ALIKE AVERSE TO IT BY SOME PAPERS OF HER FATHER WHICH FELL INTO HER HANDS SHE HEARD OF THE EXILE OF HER LOVER
6574-70753-0039 AND LEARNT THE NAME OF THE SPOT WHERE HE THEN RESIDED SHE HESITATED SOME TIME BUT AT LENGTH SHE FORMED HER DETERMINATION TAKING WITH HER SOME JEWELS THAT BELONGED TO HER AND A SUM OF MONEY SHE QUITTED ITALY WITH AN ATTENDANT A NATIVE OF LEGHORN
6574-70753-0040 ABOUT TWENTY LEAGUES FROM THE COTTAGE OF DE LACEY WHEN HER ATTENDANT FELL DANGEROUSLY ILL
6574-70753-0041 BUT THE POOR GIRL DIED AND THE ARABIAN WAS LEFT ALONE UNACQUAINTED WITH THE LANGUAGE OF THE COUNTRY AND UTTERLY IGNORANT OF THE CUSTOMS OF THE WORLD
