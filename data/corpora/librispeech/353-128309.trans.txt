353-128309-0000 THE SHOEMAKER GOOD DAY SAID MONSIEUR DEFARGE LOOKING DOWN AT THE WHITE HEAD THAT BENT LOW OVER THE SHOEMAKING IT WAS RAISED FOR A MOMENT AND A VERY FAINT VOICE RESPONDED TO THE SALUTATION AS IF IT WERE AT A DISTANCE GOOD DAY
353-128309-0001 YOU ARE STILL HARD AT WORK I SEE AFTER A LONG SILENCE THE HEAD WAS LIFTED FOR ANOTHER MOMENT AND THE VOICE REPLIED YES I AM WORKING THIS TIME A PAIR OF HAGGARD EYES HAD LOOKED AT THE QUESTIONER
353-128309-0002 BEFORE THE FACE HAD DROPPED AGAIN THE FAINTNESS OF THE VOICE WAS PITIABLE AND DREADFUL IT WAS NOT THE FAINTNESS OF PHYSICAL WEAKNESS THOUGH CONFINEMENT AND HARD FARE NO DOUBT HAD THEIR PART IN IT ITS DEPLORABLE PECULIARITY WAS THAT IT WAS THE FAINTNESS OF SOLITUDE AND DISUSE
353-128309-0003 IT WAS LIKE THE LAST FEEBLE ECHO OF A SOUND MADE LONG AND LONG AGO SO ENTIRELY HAD IT LOST THE LIFE AND RESONANCE OF THE HUMAN VOICE THAT IT AFFECTED THE SENSES LIKE A ONCE BEAUTIFUL COLOUR FADED AWAY INTO A POOR WEAK STAIN
353-128309-0004 SO SUNKEN AND SUPPRESSED IT WAS THAT IT WAS LIKE A VOICE UNDERGROUND SO EXPRESSIVE IT WAS OF A HOPELESS AND LOST CREATURE THAT A FAMISHED TRAVELLER WEARIED OUT BY LONELY WANDERING IN A WILDERNESS
353-128309-0005 SOME MINUTES OF SILENT WORK HAD PASSED AND THE HAGGARD EYES HAD LOOKED UP AGAIN NOT WITH ANY INTEREST OR CURIOSITY BUT WITH A DULL MECHANICAL PERCEPTION BEFOREHAND THAT THE SPOT WHERE THE ONLY VISITOR THEY WERE AWARE OF HAD STOOD
353-128309-0006 WAS NOT YET EMPTY I WANT SAID DEFARGE WHO HAD NOT REMOVED HIS GAZE FROM THE SHOEMAKER
353-128309-0007 YOU CAN BEAR A LITTLE MORE THE SHOEMAKER STOPPED HIS WORK LOOKED WITH A VACANT AIR OF LISTENING AT THE FLOOR ON ONE SIDE OF HIM THEN SIMILARLY AT THE FLOOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HIM THEN UPWARD AT THE SPEAKER WHAT DID YOU SAY
353-128309-0008 YOU CAN BEAR A LITTLE MORE LIGHT I MUST BEAR IT IF YOU LET IT IN LAYING THE PALEST SHADOW OF A STRESS UPON THE SECOND WORD THE OPENED HALF DOOR WAS OPENED A LITTLE FURTHER AND SECURED AT THAT ANGLE FOR THE TIME
353-128309-0009 A BROAD RAY OF LIGHT FELL INTO THE GARRET
353-128309-0010 HE HAD A WHITE BEARD RAGGEDLY CUT BUT NOT VERY LONG A HOLLOW FACE AND EXCEEDINGLY BRIGHT EYES THE HOLLOWNESS AND THINNESS OF HIS FACE WOULD HAVE CAUSED THEM TO LOOK LARGE UNDER HIS YET DARK EYEBROWS AND HIS CONFUSED WHITE HAIR
353-128309-0011 BUT THEY WERE NATURALLY LARGE AND LOOKED UNNATURALLY SO HIS YELLOW RAGS OF SHIRT LAY OPEN AT THE THROAT AND SHOWED HIS BODY TO BE WITHERED AND WORN HE AND HIS OLD CANVAS FROCK AND HIS LOOSE STOCKINGS AND ALL HIS POOR TATTERS OF CLOTHES
353-128309-0012 HAD IN A LONG SECLUSION FROM DIRECT LIGHT AND AIR
353-128309-0013 THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD TO SAY WHICH WAS WHICH HE HAD PUT UP A HAND BETWEEN HIS EYES AND THE LIGHT AND THE VERY BONES OF IT SEEMED TRANSPARENT
353-128309-0014 HE NEVER LOOKED AT THE FIGURE BEFORE HIM WITHOUT FIRST LOOKING DOWN ON THIS SIDE OF HIMSELF THEN ON THAT AS IF HE HAD LOST THE HABIT OF ASSOCIATING PLACE WITH SOUND HE NEVER SPOKE WITHOUT FIRST WANDERING IN THIS MANNER AND FORGETTING TO SPEAK
353-128309-0015 ARE YOU GOING TO FINISH THAT PAIR OF SHOES TO DAY ASKED DEFARGE MOTIONING TO MISTER LORRY TO COME FORWARD WHAT DID YOU SAY DO YOU MEAN TO FINISH THAT PAIR OF SHOES TO DAY
353-128309-0016 I CAN'T SAY THAT I MEAN TO I SUPPOSE SO I DON'T KNOW BUT THE QUESTION REMINDED HIM OF HIS WORK AND HE BENT OVER IT AGAIN
353-128309-0017 MISTER LORRY CAME SILENTLY FORWARD LEAVING THE DAUGHTER BY THE DOOR WHEN HE HAD STOOD FOR A MINUTE OR TWO BY THE SIDE OF DEFARGE THE SHOEMAKER LOOKED UP HE SHOWED NO SURPRISE AT SEEING ANOTHER FIGURE
353-128309-0018 BUT THE UNSTEADY FINGERS OF ONE OF HIS HANDS STRAYED TO HIS LIPS AS HE LOOKED AT IT HIS LIPS AND HIS NAILS WERE OF THE SAME PALE LEAD COLOUR AND THEN THE HAND DROPPED TO HIS WORK AND HE ONCE MORE BENT OVER THE SHOE THE LOOK AND THE ACTION HAD OCCUPIED BUT AN INSTANT
353-128309-0019 YOU HAVE A VISITOR YOU SEE SAID MONSIEUR DEFARGE WHAT DID YOU SAY HERE IS A VISITOR THE SHOEMAKER LOOKED UP AS BEFORE BUT WITHOUT REMOVING A HAND FROM HIS WORK
353-128309-0020 HERE IS MONSIEUR WHO KNOWS A WELL MADE SHOE WHEN HE SEES ONE SHOW HIM THAT SHOE YOU ARE WORKING AT TAKE IT MONSIEUR MISTER LORRY TOOK IT IN HIS HAND TELL MONSIEUR WHAT KIND OF SHOE IT IS AND THE MAKER'S NAME
353-128309-0021 THERE WAS A LONGER PAUSE THAN USUAL BEFORE THE SHOEMAKER REPLIED
353-128309-0022 I SAID COULDN'T YOU DESCRIBE THE KIND OF SHOE FOR MONSIEUR'S INFORMATION IT IS A LADY'S SHOE IT IS A YOUNG LADY'S WALKING SHOE IT IS IN THE PRESENT MODE I NEVER SAW THE MODE
353-128309-0023 I HAVE HAD A PATTERN IN MY HAND HE GLANCED AT THE SHOE WITH SOME LITTLE PASSING TOUCH OF PRIDE AND THE MAKER'S NAME SAID DEFARGE NOW THAT HE HAD NO WORK TO HOLD HE LAID THE KNUCKLES OF THE RIGHT HAND IN THE HOLLOW OF THE LEFT
353-128309-0024 AND THEN THE KNUCKLES OF THE LEFT HAND IN THE HOLLOW OF THE RIGHT
353-128309-0025 WITHOUT A MOMENT'S INTERMISSION THE TASK OF RECALLING HIM FROM THE VAGRANCY INTO WHICH HE ALWAYS SANK WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN WAS LIKE RECALLING SOME VERY WEAK PERSON FROM A SWOON OR ENDEAVOURING IN THE HOPE OF SOME DISCLOSURE TO STAY THE SPIRIT OF A FAST DYING MAN
353-128309-0026 DID YOU ASK ME FOR MY NAME ASSUREDLY I DID ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE NORTH TOWER IS THAT ALL ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE NORTH TOWER
353-128309-0027 WITH A WEARY SOUND THAT WAS NOT A SIGH NOR A GROAN HE BENT TO WORK AGAIN UNTIL THE SILENCE WAS AGAIN BROKEN YOU ARE NOT A SHOEMAKER BY TRADE SAID MISTER LORRY LOOKING STEADFASTLY AT HIM
353-128309-0028 HIS HAGGARD EYES TURNED TO DEFARGE AS IF HE WOULD HAVE TRANSFERRED THE QUESTION TO HIM BUT AS NO HELP CAME FROM THAT QUARTER THEY TURNED BACK ON THE QUESTIONER WHEN THEY HAD SOUGHT THE GROUND I AM NOT A SHOEMAKER BY TRADE NO I WAS NOT A SHOEMAKER BY TRADE
353-128309-0029 I I LEARNT IT HERE I TAUGHT MYSELF I ASKED LEAVE TO HE LAPSED AWAY EVEN FOR MINUTES RINGING THOSE MEASURED CHANGES ON HIS HANDS THE WHOLE TIME
353-128309-0030 HIS EYES CAME SLOWLY BACK AT LAST TO THE FACE FROM WHICH THEY HAD WANDERED WHEN THEY RESTED ON IT HE STARTED AND RESUMED IN THE MANNER OF A SLEEPER THAT MOMENT AWAKE REVERTING TO A SUBJECT OF LAST NIGHT
353-128309-0031 I ASKED LEAVE TO TEACH MYSELF AND I GOT IT WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY AFTER A LONG WHILE AND I HAVE MADE SHOES EVER SINCE AS HE HELD OUT HIS HAND FOR THE SHOE THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM MISTER LORRY SAID STILL LOOKING STEADFASTLY IN HIS FACE
353-128309-0032 MONSIEUR MANETTE DO YOU REMEMBER NOTHING OF ME THE SHOE DROPPED TO THE GROUND AND HE SAT LOOKING FIXEDLY AT THE QUESTIONER MONSIEUR MANETTE MISTER LORRY LAID HIS HAND UPON DEFARGE'S ARM
353-128309-0033 AS THE CAPTIVE OF MANY YEARS SAT LOOKING FIXEDLY BY TURNS AT MISTER LORRY AND AT DEFARGE SOME LONG OBLITERATED MARKS OF AN ACTIVELY INTENT INTELLIGENCE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREHEAD
353-128309-0034 GRADUALLY FORCED THEMSELVES THROUGH THE BLACK MIST THAT HAD FALLEN ON HIM THEY WERE OVERCLOUDED AGAIN THEY WERE FAINTER THEY WERE GONE BUT THEY HAD BEEN THERE AND SO EXACTLY WAS THE EXPRESSION REPEATED ON THE FAIR YOUNG FACE OF HER
353-128309-0035 WHO HAD CREPT ALONG THE WALL TO A POINT WHERE SHE COULD SEE HIM AND WHERE SHE NOW STOOD LOOKING AT HIM WITH HANDS WHICH AT FIRST HAD BEEN ONLY RAISED IN FRIGHTENED COMPASSION IF NOT EVEN TO KEEP HIM OFF AND SHUT OUT THE SIGHT OF HIM BUT WHICH WERE NOW EXTENDING TOWARDS HIM
353-128309-0036 TREMBLING WITH EAGERNESS TO LAY THE SPECTRAL FACE UPON HER WARM YOUNG BREAST AND LOVE IT BACK TO LIFE AND HOPE SO EXACTLY WAS THE EXPRESSION REPEATED THOUGH IN STRONGER CHARACTERS ON HER FAIR YOUNG FACE
353-128309-0037 DARKNESS HAD FALLEN ON HIM IN ITS PLACE HE LOOKED AT THE TWO LESS AND LESS ATTENTIVELY AND HIS EYES IN GLOOMY ABSTRACTION SOUGHT THE GROUND AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM IN THE OLD WAY FINALLY WITH A DEEP LONG SIGH
353-128309-0038 HE TOOK THE SHOE UP AND RESUMED HIS WORK HAVE YOU RECOGNISED HIM MONSIEUR ASKED DEFARGE IN A WHISPER YES FOR A MOMENT AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT QUITE HOPELESS
353-128309-0039 BUT I HAVE UNQUESTIONABLY SEEN FOR A SINGLE MOMENT THE FACE THAT I ONCE KNEW SO WELL HUSH LET US DRAW FURTHER BACK HUSH SHE HAD MOVED FROM THE WALL OF THE GARRET VERY NEAR TO THE BENCH ON WHICH HE SAT
353-128309-0040 THERE WAS SOMETHING AWFUL IN HIS UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF THE FIGURE THAT COULD HAVE PUT OUT ITS HAND AND TOUCHED HIM AS HE STOOPED OVER HIS LABOUR NOT A WORD WAS SPOKEN NOT A SOUND WAS MADE SHE STOOD LIKE A SPIRIT BESIDE HIM
353-128309-0041 AND HE BENT OVER HIS WORK IT HAPPENED AT LENGTH THAT HE HAD OCCASION TO CHANGE THE INSTRUMENT IN HIS HAND FOR HIS SHOEMAKER'S KNIFE
353-128309-0042 HE HAD TAKEN IT UP AND WAS STOOPING TO WORK AGAIN WHEN HIS EYES CAUGHT THE SKIRT OF HER DRESS HE RAISED THEM AND SAW HER FACE THE TWO SPECTATORS STARTED FORWARD BUT SHE STAYED THEM WITH A MOTION OF HER HAND
353-128309-0043 SHE HAD NO FEAR OF HIS STRIKING AT HER WITH THE KNIFE THOUGH THEY HAD HE STARED AT HER WITH A FEARFUL LOOK AND AFTER A WHILE HIS LIPS BEGAN TO FORM SOME WORDS THOUGH NO SOUND PROCEEDED FROM THEM BY DEGREES
353-128309-0044 IN THE PAUSES OF HIS QUICK AND LABOURED BREATHING HE WAS HEARD TO SAY WHAT IS THIS WITH THE TEARS STREAMING DOWN HER FACE SHE PUT HER TWO HANDS TO HER LIPS AND KISSED THEM TO HIM THEN CLASPED THEM ON HER BREAST AS IF SHE LAID HIS RUINED HEAD THERE
353-128309-0045 SHE SIGHED NO WHO ARE YOU NOT YET TRUSTING THE TONES OF HER VOICE SHE SAT DOWN ON THE BENCH BESIDE HIM HE RECOILED BUT SHE LAID HER HAND UPON HIS ARM
353-128309-0046 A STRANGE THRILL STRUCK HIM WHEN SHE DID SO AND VISIBLY PASSED OVER HIS FRAME HE LAID THE KNIFE DOWN SOFTLY AS HE SAT STARING AT HER HER GOLDEN HAIR WHICH SHE WORE IN LONG CURLS HAD BEEN HURRIEDLY PUSHED ASIDE AND FELL DOWN OVER HER NECK
353-128309-0047 ADVANCING HIS HAND BY LITTLE AND LITTLE HE TOOK IT UP AND LOOKED AT IT IN THE MIDST OF THE ACTION HE WENT ASTRAY AND WITH ANOTHER DEEP SIGH FELL TO WORK AT HIS SHOEMAKING BUT NOT FOR LONG RELEASING HIS ARM SHE LAID HER HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER
353-128309-0048 HE TOOK HER HAIR INTO HIS HAND AGAIN AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT IT IT IS THE SAME HOW CAN IT BE WHEN WAS IT HOW WAS IT AS THE CONCENTRATED EXPRESSION RETURNED TO HIS FOREHEAD
353-128309-0049 HE SEEMED TO BECOME CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS IN HERS TOO HE TURNED HER FULL TO THE LIGHT AND LOOKED AT HER
353-128309-0050 SHE HAD A FEAR OF MY GOING THOUGH I HAD NONE AND WHEN I WAS BROUGHT TO THE NORTH TOWER THEY FOUND THESE UPON MY SLEEVE YOU WILL LEAVE ME THEM THEY CAN NEVER HELP ME TO ESCAPE IN THE BODY THOUGH THEY MAY IN THE SPIRIT
353-128309-0051 THOSE WERE THE WORDS I SAID I REMEMBER THEM VERY WELL HE FORMED THIS SPEECH WITH HIS LIPS MANY TIMES BEFORE HE COULD UTTER IT BUT WHEN HE DID FIND SPOKEN WORDS FOR IT THEY CAME TO HIM COHERENTLY THOUGH SLOWLY
353-128309-0052 HOW WAS THIS WAS IT YOU ONCE MORE THE TWO SPECTATORS STARTED AS HE TURNED UPON HER WITH A FRIGHTFUL SUDDENNESS BUT SHE SAT PERFECTLY STILL IN HIS GRASP AND ONLY SAID
353-128309-0053 IN A LOW VOICE I ENTREAT YOU GOOD GENTLEMEN DO NOT COME NEAR US DO NOT SPEAK DO NOT MOVE HARK HE EXCLAIMED WHOSE VOICE WAS THAT HIS HANDS RELEASED HER AS HE UTTERED THIS CRY AND WENT UP TO HIS WHITE HAIR WHICH THEY TORE IN A FRENZY
353-128309-0054 IT DIED OUT AS EVERYTHING BUT HIS SHOEMAKING DID DIE OUT OF HIM AND HE REFOLDED HIS LITTLE PACKET AND TRIED TO SECURE IT IN HIS BREAST BUT HE STILL LOOKED AT HER AND GLOOMILY SHOOK HIS HEAD NO NO NO YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TOO BLOOMING
353-128309-0055 IT CAN'T BE SEE WHAT THE PRISONER IS THESE ARE NOT THE HANDS SHE KNEW THIS IS NOT THE FACE SHE KNEW THIS IS NOT A VOICE SHE EVER HEARD NO NO SHE WAS AND HE WAS BEFORE THE SLOW YEARS OF THE NORTH TOWER

353-128309-0065 THAT THE TWO BEHOLDERS COVERED THEIR FACES
353-128309-0066 AND HIS HEAVING BREAST AND SHAKEN FORM HAD LONG YIELDED TO THE CALM THAT MUST FOLLOW ALL STORMS EMBLEM TO HUMANITY OF THE REST AND SILENCE INTO WHICH THE STORM CALLED LIFE MUST HUSH AT LAST THEY CAME FORWARD TO RAISE THE FATHER AND DAUGHTER FROM THE GROUND
353-128309-0067 HE HAD GRADUALLY DROPPED TO THE FLOOR AND LAY THERE IN A LETHARGY WORN OUT SHE HAD NESTLED DOWN WITH HIM THAT HIS HEAD MIGHT LIE UPON HER ARM AND HER HAIR DROOPING OVER HIM CURTAINED HIM FROM THE LIGHT
353-128309-0068 IF WITHOUT DISTURBING HIM SHE SAID RAISING HER HAND TO MISTER LORRY AS HE STOOPED OVER THEM AFTER REPEATED BLOWINGS OF HIS NOSE
353-128309-0069 SO THAT FROM THE VERY DOOR HE COULD BE TAKEN AWAY BUT CONSIDER IS HE FIT FOR THE JOURNEY ASKED MISTER LORRY MORE FIT FOR THAT I THINK THAN TO REMAIN IN THIS CITY SO DREADFUL TO HIM IT IS TRUE SAID DEFARGE WHO WAS KNEELING TO LOOK ON AND HEAR

353-128309-0072 BOTH MISTER LORRY AND DEFARGE WERE RATHER DISINCLINED TO THIS COURSE AND IN FAVOUR OF ONE OF THEM REMAINING BUT AS THERE WERE NOT ONLY CARRIAGE AND HORSES TO BE SEEN TO BUT TRAVELLING PAPERS AND AS TIME PRESSED FOR THE DAY WAS DRAWING TO AN END
353-128309-0073 IT CAME AT LAST TO THEIR HASTILY DIVIDING THE BUSINESS THAT WAS NECESSARY TO BE DONE AND HURRYING AWAY TO DO IT THEN AS THE DARKNESS CLOSED IN
353-128309-0074 AND WATCHED HIM THE DARKNESS DEEPENED AND DEEPENED AND THEY BOTH LAY QUIET UNTIL A LIGHT GLEAMED THROUGH THE CHINKS IN THE WALL MISTER LORRY AND MONSIEUR DEFARGE HAD MADE ALL READY FOR THE JOURNEY AND HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM BESIDES TRAVELLING CLOAKS AND WRAPPERS
353-128309-0075 BREAD AND MEAT WINE AND HOT COFFEE
353-128309-0076 THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE IN THE GARRET BUT A PALLET BED AND HE AND MISTER LORRY ROUSED THE CAPTIVE AND ASSISTED HIM TO HIS FEET
353-128309-0077 IN THE SCARED BLANK WONDER OF HIS FACE WHETHER HE KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHETHER HE RECOLLECTED WHAT THEY HAD SAID TO HIM
353-128309-0078 THEY TRIED SPEAKING TO HIM BUT HE WAS SO CONFUSED AND SO VERY SLOW TO ANSWER THAT THEY TOOK FRIGHT AT HIS BEWILDERMENT AND AGREED FOR THE TIME TO TAMPER WITH HIM NO MORE HE HAD A WILD LOST MANNER OF OCCASIONALLY CLASPING HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS THAT HAD NOT BEEN SEEN IN HIM BEFORE
353-128309-0079 YET HE HAD SOME PLEASURE IN THE MERE SOUND OF HIS DAUGHTER'S VOICE AND INVARIABLY TURNED TO IT WHEN SHE SPOKE IN THE SUBMISSIVE WAY OF ONE LONG ACCUSTOMED TO OBEY UNDER COERCION HE ATE AND DRANK WHAT THEY GAVE HIM TO EAT AND DRINK AND PUT ON THE CLOAK AND OTHER WRAPPINGS THAT THEY GAVE HIM TO WEAR
353-128309-0080 HE READILY RESPONDED TO HIS DAUGHTER'S DRAWING HER ARM THROUGH HIS AND TOOK AND KEPT HER HAND IN BOTH HIS OWN THEY BEGAN TO DESCEND MONSIEUR DEFARGE GOING FIRST WITH THE LAMP MISTER LORRY CLOSING THE LITTLE PROCESSION
353-128309-0081 THEY HAD NOT TRAVERSED MANY STEPS OF THE LONG MAIN STAIRCASE WHEN HE STOPPED AND STARED AT THE ROOF AND ROUND AT THE WALLS YOU REMEMBER THE PLACE MY FATHER YOU REMEMBER COMING UP HERE WHAT DID YOU SAY BUT BEFORE SHE COULD REPEAT THE QUESTION
353-128309-0082 REMEMBER NO I DON'T REMEMBER IT WAS SO VERY LONG AGO THAT HE HAD NO RECOLLECTION WHATEVER OF HIS HAVING BEEN BROUGHT FROM HIS PRISON TO THAT HOUSE WAS APPARENT TO THEM THEY HEARD HIM MUTTER
353-128309-0083 ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE NORTH TOWER AND WHEN HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM
353-128309-0084 ON THEIR REACHING THE COURTYARD HE INSTINCTIVELY ALTERED HIS TREAD AS BEING IN EXPECTATION OF A DRAWBRIDGE AND WHEN THERE WAS NO DRAWBRIDGE AND HE SAW THE CARRIAGE WAITING IN THE OPEN STREET HE DROPPED HIS DAUGHTER'S HAND AND CLASPED HIS HEAD AGAIN
353-128309-0085 NO CROWD WAS ABOUT THE DOOR NO PEOPLE WERE DISCERNIBLE AT ANY OF THE MANY WINDOWS
353-128309-0086 AN UNNATURAL SILENCE AND DESERTION REIGNED THERE ONLY ONE SOUL WAS TO BE SEEN AND THAT WAS MADAME DEFARGE WHO LEANED AGAINST THE DOOR POST KNITTING AND SAW NOTHING
353-128309-0087 THE PRISONER HAD GOT INTO A COACH AND HIS DAUGHTER HAD FOLLOWED HIM WHEN MISTER LORRY'S FEET WERE ARRESTED ON THE STEP BY HIS ASKING MISERABLY FOR HIS SHOEMAKING TOOLS AND THE UNFINISHED SHOES
353-128309-0088 AND WENT KNITTING OUT OF THE LAMPLIGHT THROUGH THE COURTYARD SHE QUICKLY BROUGHT THEM DOWN AND HANDED THEM IN AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS LEANED AGAINST THE DOOR POST KNITTING AND SAW NOTHING DEFARGE GOT UPON THE BOX AND GAVE THE WORD TO THE BARRIER
353-128309-0089 THE POSTILION CRACKED HIS WHIP AND THEY CLATTERED AWAY UNDER THE FEEBLE OVER SWINGING LAMPS UNDER THE OVER SWINGING LAMPS SWINGING EVER BRIGHTER IN THE BETTER STREETS AND EVER DIMMER IN THE WORSE AND BY LIGHTED SHOPS GAY CROWDS
353-128309-0090 ILLUMINATED COFFEE HOUSES AND THEATRE DOORS TO ONE OF THE CITY GATES SOLDIERS WITH LANTERNS AT THE GUARD HOUSE THERE YOUR PAPERS TRAVELLERS SEE HERE THEN MONSIEUR THE OFFICER SAID DEFARGE GETTING DOWN AND TAKING HIM GRAVELY APART
353-128309-0091 THESE ARE THE PAPERS OF MONSIEUR INSIDE WITH THE WHITE HEAD THEY WERE CONSIGNED TO ME WITH HIM AT THE HE DROPPED HIS VOICE THERE WAS A FLUTTER AMONG THE MILITARY LANTERNS AND ONE OF THEM BEING HANDED INTO THE COACH BY AN ARM IN UNIFORM THE EYES CONNECTED WITH THE ARM LOOKED
353-128309-0092 AT MONSIEUR WITH THE WHITE HEAD IT IS WELL FORWARD
353-128309-0093 ADIEU FROM DEFARGE AND SO UNDER A SHORT GROVE OF FEEBLER AND FEEBLER OVER SWINGING LAMPS OUT UNDER THE GREAT GROVE OF STARS BENEATH THAT ARCH OF UNMOVED AND ETERNAL LIGHTS
353-128309-0094 SOME SO REMOTE FROM THIS LITTLE EARTH THAT THE LEARNED TELL US IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THEIR RAYS HAVE EVEN YET DISCOVERED IT AS A POINT IN SPACE WHERE ANYTHING IS SUFFERED OR DONE THE SHADOWS OF THE NIGHT WERE BROAD AND BLACK ALL THROUGH THE COLD AND RESTLESS INTERVAL UNTIL DAWN
353-128309-0095 THEY ONCE MORE WHISPERED IN THE EARS OF MISTER JARVIS LORRY SITTING OPPOSITE THE BURIED MAN WHO HAD BEEN DUG OUT AND WONDERING WHAT SUBTLE POWERS WERE FOR EVER LOST TO HIM AND WHAT WERE CAPABLE OF RESTORATION THE OLD INQUIRY
353-128309-0096 I HOPE YOU CARE TO BE RECALLED TO LIFE AND THE OLD ANSWER
