2769-176263-0000 IF WHAT THE BOY SAYS IS CORRECT IT SOUNDS AS IF THE PERSON WHOM YOU ARE SEEKING MAY HAVE HAD A FINGER IN THE PIE I WAS OF THE SAME OPINION AS APPARENTLY WERE LESSINGHAM AND SIDNEY ATHERTON COLLARED THE YOUTH BY THE SHOULDER WHICH MISTER PLEESMAN HAD LEFT DISENGAGED
2769-176263-0001 WHAT SORT OF LOOKING BLOKE IS IT WHO'S BEEN MURDERED I DUNNO I AVEN'T SEEN IM MISSUS ENDERSON SHE SAYS TO ME GUSTUS BARLEY SHE SAYS A BLOKE'S BEEN MURDERED
2769-176263-0002 AND LEFT IM BEHIND UP IN MY BACK ROOM YOU RUN AS ARD AS YOU CAN TEAR AND TELL THEM THERE DRATTED PLEESE WHAT'S SO FOND OF SHOVIN THEIR DIRTY NOSES INTO RESPECTABLE PEOPLE'S OUSES SO I COMES AND TELLS YER THAT'S ALL I KNOWS ABOUT IT
2769-176263-0003 WE WENT FOUR IN THE HANSOM WHICH HAD BEEN WAITING IN THE STREET TO MISSUS HENDERSON'S IN PARADISE PLACE THE INSPECTOR AND WE THREE MISTER PLEESMAN AND GUSTUS BARLEY FOLLOWED ON FOOT THE INSPECTOR WAS EXPLANATORY
2769-176263-0004 MISSUS HENDERSON KEEPS A SORT OF LODGING HOUSE A SAILORS HOME SHE CALLS IT BUT NO ONE COULD CALL IT SWEET IT DOESN'T BEAR THE BEST OF CHARACTERS AND IF YOU ASKED ME WHAT I THOUGHT OF IT I SHOULD SAY IN PLAIN ENGLISH THAT IT WAS A DISORDERLY HOUSE
2769-176263-0005 PARADISE PLACE PROVED TO BE WITHIN THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED YARDS OF THE STATION HOUSE SO FAR AS COULD BE SEEN IN THE DARK IT CONSISTED OF A ROW OF HOUSES OF CONSIDERABLE DIMENSIONS AND ALSO OF CONSIDERABLE ANTIQUITY
2769-176263-0006 THEY OPENED ON TO TWO OR THREE STONE STEPS WHICH LED DIRECTLY INTO THE STREET AT ONE OF THE DOORS STOOD AN OLD LADY WITH A SHAWL DRAWN OVER HER HEAD THIS WAS MISSUS HENDERSON SHE GREETED US WITH GARRULOUS VOLUBILITY
2769-176263-0007 I THOUGHT YOU NEVER WAS A COMIN THAT I DID SHE RECOGNISED THE INSPECTOR IT'S YOU MISTER PHILLIPS IS IT PERCEIVING US SHE DREW A LITTLE BACK WHO'S THEM ERE PARTIES THEY AIN'T COPPERS
2769-176263-0008 MISTER PHILLIPS DISMISSED HER INQUIRY CURTLY NEVER YOU MIND WHO THEY ARE WHAT'S THIS ABOUT SOMEONE BEING MURDERED SSH THE OLD LADY GLANCED ROUND DON'T YOU SPEAK SO LOUD MISTER PHILLIPS
2769-176263-0009 NO ONE DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT AS YET THE PARTIES WHAT'S IN MY OUSE IS MOST RESPECTABLE MOST AND THEY COULDN'T ABIDE THE NOTION OF THERE BEING POLICE ABOUT THE PLACE
2769-176263-0010 MISSUS HENDERSON LED THE WAY UP A STAIRCASE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN DISTINCTLY THE BETTER FOR REPAIRS IT WAS NECESSARY TO PICK ONE'S WAY AS ONE WENT AND AS THE LIGHT WAS DEFECTIVE STUMBLES WERE NOT INFREQUENT
2769-176263-0011 FROM SOME MYSTERIOUS RECESS IN HER APPAREL SHE PRODUCED A KEY
2769-176263-0012 I LOCKED THE DOOR SO THAT NOTHING MIGHTN'T BE DISTURBED I KNOWS OW PARTICULAR YOU PLEESMEN IS SHE TURNED THE KEY WE ALL WENT IN WE THIS TIME IN FRONT AND SHE BEHIND
2769-176263-0013 A CANDLE WAS GUTTERING ON A BROKEN AND DILAPIDATED SINGLE WASHHAND STAND A SMALL IRON BEDSTEAD STOOD BY ITS SIDE THE CLOTHES ON WHICH WERE ALL TUMBLED AND TOSSED
2769-176263-0014 I COULD SEE NOTHING IN THE SHAPE OF A MURDERED MAN NOR IT APPEARED COULD THE INSPECTOR EITHER WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS MISSUS HENDERSON I DON'T SEE ANYTHING HERE IT'S BE'IND THE BED MISTER PHILLIPS I LEFT IM JUST WHERE I FOUND IM
2769-176263-0015 THE RELIEF IN HIS TONE WAS UNMISTAKABLE THAT THE ONE WAS GONE WAS PLAINLY NOTHING TO HIM IN COMPARISON WITH THE FACT THAT THE OTHER WAS LEFT THRUSTING THE BED MORE INTO THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM I KNELT DOWN BESIDE THE MAN ON THE FLOOR
2769-176263-0016 I DOUBT IF THERE WAS AN OUNCE OF FLESH ON THE WHOLE OF HIS BODY HIS CHEEKS AND THE SOCKETS OF HIS EYES WERE HOLLOW THE SKIN WAS DRAWN TIGHTLY OVER HIS CHEEK BONES THE BONES THEMSELVES WERE STARING THROUGH EVEN HIS NOSE WAS WASTED
2769-176263-0017 SO THAT NOTHING BUT A RIDGE OF CARTILAGE REMAINED I PUT MY ARM BENEATH HIS SHOULDER AND RAISED HIM FROM THE FLOOR NO RESISTANCE WAS OFFERED BY THE BODY'S GRAVITY HE WAS AS LIGHT AS A LITTLE CHILD I DOUBT I SAID IF THIS MAN HAS BEEN MURDERED
2769-176263-0018 IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE A CASE OF STARVATION OR EXHAUSTION POSSIBLY A COMBINATION OF BOTH WHAT'S THAT ON HIS NECK ASKED THE INSPECTOR HE WAS KNEELING AT MY SIDE HE REFERRED TO TWO ABRASIONS OF THE SKIN ONE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE MAN'S NECK
2769-176263-0019 THEY LOOK TO ME LIKE SCRATCHES THEY SEEM PRETTY DEEP BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'RE SUFFICIENT IN THEMSELVES TO CAUSE DEATH THEY MIGHT BE JOINED TO AN ALREADY WEAKENED CONSTITUTION IS THERE ANYTHING IN HIS POCKETS LET'S LIFT HIM ON TO THE BED
2769-176263-0020 WE LIFTED HIM ON TO THE BED A FEATHERWEIGHT HE WAS TO LIFT WHILE THE INSPECTOR WAS EXAMINING HIS POCKETS TO FIND THEM EMPTY A TALL MAN WITH A BIG BLACK BEARD CAME BUSTLING IN HE PROVED TO BE DOCTOR GLOSSOP
2769-176263-0021 THE LOCAL POLICE SURGEON WHO HAD BEEN SENT FOR BEFORE OUR QUITTING THE STATION HOUSE HIS FIRST PRONOUNCEMENT MADE AS SOON AS HE COMMENCED HIS EXAMINATION WAS UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY STARTLING I DON'T BELIEVE THE MAN'S DEAD
2769-176263-0022 WHY DIDN'T YOU SEND FOR ME DIRECTLY YOU FOUND HIM THE QUESTION WAS PUT TO MISSUS HENDERSON WELL DOCTOR GLOSSOP
2769-176263-0023 BECAUSE AS I'VE SAID AFORE I KNOW OW PARTICULAR THEM PLEESMEN IS

2769-176263-0025 I DOUBT IF IT WAS FLATTERING TO MISSUS HENDERSON HAVE YOU GOT ANY BRANDY IN THE HOUSE
2769-176263-0026 EVERYTHINK THEN SUDDENLY REMEMBERING THAT THE POLICE WERE PRESENT AND THAT HERS WERE NOT EXACTLY LICENSED PREMISES LEASTWAYS WE CAN SEND OUT FOR IT FOR THEM PARTIES AS GIVES US THE MONEY BEING AS IS WELL KNOWN ALWAYS WILLING TO OBLIGE THEN SEND FOR SOME
2769-176263-0027 TO THE TAP DOWNSTAIRS IF THAT'S THE NEAREST IF THIS MAN DIES BEFORE YOU'VE BROUGHT IT I'LL HAVE YOU LOCKED UP AS SURE AS YOU'RE A LIVING WOMAN THE ARRIVAL OF THE BRANDY WAS NOT LONG DELAYED BUT THE MAN ON THE BED HAD REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS BEFORE IT CAME
2769-176263-0028 AS IF THIS BIG BEARDED MAN WAS SOMETHING ALTOGETHER STRANGE ATHERTON BENT DOWN BESIDE THE DOCTOR I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU LOOKING BETTER MISTER HOLT YOU KNOW ME DON'T YOU I'VE BEEN RUNNING ABOUT AFTER YOU ALL DAY LONG YOU ARE YOU ARE
2769-176263-0029 THE MAN'S EYES CLOSED AS IF THE EFFORT AT RECOLLECTION EXHAUSTED HIM HE KEPT THEM CLOSED AS HE CONTINUED TO SPEAK I KNOW WHO YOU ARE YOU ARE THE GENTLEMAN YES THAT'S IT I'M THE GENTLEMAN NAME OF ATHERTON

2769-176263-0031 TO BE MORE PROMINENT THAN EVER THE DOCTOR LAID HIM BACK UPON THE BED FEELING HIS PULSE WITH ONE HAND WHILE HE STOOD AND REGARDED HIM IN SILENCE THEN TURNING TO THE INSPECTOR HE SAID TO HIM IN AN UNDERTONE IF YOU WANT HIM TO MAKE A STATEMENT HE'LL HAVE TO MAKE IT NOW HE'S GOING FAST
2769-176263-0032 ON HIS SKELETON FEATURES THERE CAME A LOOK OF PANIC FEAR HE WAS EVIDENTLY STRUGGLING TO SPEAK AT LAST WORDS CAME THE BEETLE HE STOPPED THEN AFTER AN EFFORT SPOKE AGAIN THE BEETLE WHAT'S HE MEAN
2769-176263-0033 IS THAT THE MEANING OF THE MARKS UPON YOUR NECK THE BEETLE KILLED ME THE LIDS CLOSED THE MAN RELAPSED INTO A STATE OF LETHARGY THE INSPECTOR WAS PUZZLED AND SAID SO WHAT'S HE MEAN ABOUT A BEETLE ATHERTON REPLIED
2769-176263-0034 I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANS AND MY FRIENDS DO TOO WE'LL EXPLAIN AFTERWARDS IN THE MEANTIME I THINK I'D BETTER GET AS MUCH OUT OF HIM AS I CAN WHILE THERE'S TIME YES SAID THE DOCTOR HIS HAND UPON THE PATIENT'S PULSE WHILE THERE'S TIME
2769-176263-0035 THERE ISN'T MUCH ONLY SECONDS SYDNEY ENDEAVOURED TO ROUSE THE MAN FROM HIS STUPOR YOU'VE BEEN WITH MISS LINDON ALL THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HAVEN'T YOU MISTER HOLT ATHERTON HAD REACHED A CHORD IN THE MAN'S CONSCIOUSNESS

2769-176263-0037 THERE CAME INTO THEM THE FORMER STARING HORROR HE BECAME POSSESSED BY UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION HALF RAISING HIMSELF IN BED WORDS CAME FROM HIS QUIVERING LIPS AS IF THEY WERE ONLY DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE FORCE OF HIS ANGUISH
2769-176263-0038 THE BEETLE'S GOING TO KILL MISS LINDON A MOMENTARY PAROXYSM SEEMED TO SHAKE THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF HIS BEING HIS WHOLE FRAME QUIVERED HE FELL BACK ON TO THE BED OMINOUSLY THE DOCTOR EXAMINED HIM IN SILENCE
2769-176263-0039 WHILE WE TOO WERE STILL THIS TIME HE'S GONE FOR GOOD THERE'LL BE NO CONJURING HIM BACK AGAIN I FELT A SUDDEN PRESSURE ON MY ARM AND FOUND THAT LESSINGHAM WAS CLUTCHING ME WITH PROBABLY UNCONSCIOUS VIOLENCE THE MUSCLES OF HIS FACE WERE TWITCHING
2769-176263-0040 HE TREMBLED I TURNED TO THE DOCTOR DOCTOR IF THERE IS ANY OF THAT BRANDY LEFT WILL YOU LET ME HAVE IT FOR MY FRIEND LESSINGHAM DISPOSED OF THE REMAINDER OF THE SHILLINGS WORTH
2769-176263-0041 NOW MISSUS HENDERSON PERHAPS YOU'LL TELL US WHAT ALL THIS MEANS WHO IS THIS MAN AND HOW DID HE COME IN HERE AND WHO CAME IN WITH HIM AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT ALTOGETHER
