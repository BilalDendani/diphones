3889-9915-0000 THE GAMIN LOVES THE CITY HE ALSO LOVES SOLITUDE SINCE HE HAS SOMETHING OF THE SAGE IN HIM
3889-9915-0001 TO ROAM THOUGHTFULLY ABOUT THAT IS TO SAY TO LOUNGE IS A FINE EMPLOYMENT OF TIME IN THE EYES OF THE PHILOSOPHER PARTICULARLY IN THAT RATHER ILLEGITIMATE SPECIES OF CAMPAIGN WHICH IS TOLERABLY UGLY
3889-9915-0002 BUT ODD AND COMPOSED OF TWO NATURES WHICH SURROUNDS CERTAIN GREAT CITIES NOTABLY PARIS TO STUDY THE SUBURBS IS TO STUDY THE AMPHIBIOUS ANIMAL END OF THE TREES BEGINNING OF THE ROOFS END OF THE GRASS
3889-9915-0003 BEGINNING OF THE PAVEMENTS END OF THE FURROWS BEGINNING OF THE SHOPS END OF THE WHEEL RUTS BEGINNING OF THE PASSIONS END OF THE DIVINE MURMUR BEGINNING OF THE HUMAN UPROAR HENCE AN EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST
3889-9915-0004 HENCE IN THESE NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE PLACES INDELIBLY STAMPED BY THE PASSING STROLLER WITH THE EPITHET MELANCHOLY THE APPARENTLY OBJECTLESS PROMENADES OF THE DREAMER
3889-9915-0005 HE WHO WRITES THESE LINES HAS LONG BEEN A PROWLER ABOUT THE BARRIERS OF PARIS AND IT IS FOR HIM A SOURCE OF PROFOUND SOUVENIRS THAT CLOSE SHAVEN TURF THOSE PEBBLY PATHS THAT CHALK THOSE POOLS
3889-9915-0006 THOSE HARSH MONOTONIES OF WASTE AND FALLOW LANDS THE PLANTS OF EARLY MARKET GARDEN SUDDENLY SPRINGING INTO SIGHT IN A BOTTOM THAT MIXTURE OF THE SAVAGE AND THE CITIZEN THOSE VAST DESERT NOOKS WHERE THE GARRISON DRUMS PRACTISE NOISILY
3889-9915-0007 A SORT OF LISPING OF BATTLE THOSE HERMITS BY DAY AND CUT THROATS BY NIGHT THAT CLUMSY MILL WHICH TURNS IN THE WIND
3889-9915-0008 THE MYSTERIOUS CHARM OF GREAT SOMBRE WALLS SQUARELY INTERSECTING IMMENSE VAGUE STRETCHES OF LAND INUNDATED WITH SUNSHINE AND FULL OF BUTTERFLIES ALL THIS ATTRACTED HIM
3889-9915-0009 THERE IS HARDLY ANY ONE ON EARTH WHO IS NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THOSE SINGULAR SPOTS
3889-9915-0010 THE CUNETTE THE HIDEOUS WALL OF GRENELLE ALL SPECKLED WITH BALLS MONT PARNASSE
3889-9915-0011 EXCEPT TO RAISE MUSHROOMS AND WHICH IS CLOSED ON A LEVEL WITH THE GROUND BY A TRAP DOOR OF ROTTEN PLANKS THE CAMPAGNA OF ROME IS ONE IDEA THE BANLIEUE OF PARIS IS ANOTHER TO BEHOLD NOTHING BUT FIELDS
3889-9915-0012 HOUSES OR TREES IN WHAT A STRETCH OF COUNTRY OFFERS US IS TO REMAIN ON THE SURFACE ALL ASPECTS OF THINGS ARE THOUGHTS OF GOD
3889-9915-0013 PIERCING MELANCHOLY NATURE AND HUMANITY BOTH APPEAL TO YOU AT THE SAME TIME THERE LOCAL ORIGINALITIES THERE MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE ANY ONE WHO LIKE OURSELVES
3889-9915-0014 HAS WANDERED ABOUT IN THESE SOLITUDES CONTIGUOUS TO OUR FAUBOURGS WHICH MAY BE DESIGNATED AS THE LIMBOS OF PARIS HAS SEEN HERE AND THERE IN THE MOST DESERT SPOT AT THE MOST UNEXPECTED MOMENT
3889-9915-0015 CHILDREN GROUPED TUMULTUOUSLY FETID MUDDY DUSTY RAGGED DISHEVELLED PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK AND CROWNED WITH CORN FLOWERS ALL OF THEM ARE LITTLE ONES WHO HAVE MADE THEIR ESCAPE FROM POOR FAMILIES
3889-9915-0016 THE OUTER BOULEVARD IS THEIR BREATHING SPACE THE SUBURBS BELONG TO THEM THERE THEY ARE ETERNALLY PLAYING TRUANT THERE THEY INNOCENTLY SING THEIR REPERTORY OF DIRTY SONGS THERE THEY ARE
3889-9915-0017 OR RATHER THERE THEY EXIST FAR FROM EVERY EYE IN THE SWEET LIGHT OF MAY OR JUNE KNEELING ROUND A HOLE IN THE GROUND SNAPPING MARBLES WITH THEIR THUMBS QUARRELLING OVER HALF FARTHINGS IRRESPONSIBLE VOLATILE FREE AND HAPPY
3889-9915-0018 AND NO SOONER DO THEY CATCH SIGHT OF YOU THAN THEY RECOLLECT THAT THEY HAVE AN INDUSTRY AND THAT THEY MUST EARN THEIR LIVING AND THEY OFFER TO SELL YOU AN OLD WOOLLEN STOCKING FILLED WITH COCKCHAFERS OR A BUNCH OF LILACS
3889-9915-0019 ARE THEY THEIR SISTERS WHO ARE ALMOST YOUNG MAIDENS THIN FEVERISH WITH SUNBURNT HANDS COVERED WITH FRECKLES CROWNED WITH POPPIES AND EARS OF RYE GAY HAGGARD BAREFOOTED THEY CAN BE SEEN DEVOURING CHERRIES AMONG THE WHEAT
3889-9915-0020 IN THE EVENING THEY CAN BE HEARD LAUGHING THESE GROUPS
3889-9915-0021 OCCUPY THE THOUGHTFUL MAN FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND THESE VISIONS MINGLE WITH HIS DREAMS PARIS CENTRE BANLIEUE CIRCUMFERENCE
3889-9915-0022 STRAY CHILDREN ABOUNDED IN PARIS THE STATISTICS GIVE AN AVERAGE OF TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY HOMELESS CHILDREN PICKED UP ANNUALLY AT THAT PERIOD BY THE POLICE PATROLS IN UNENCLOSED LANDS
3889-9915-0023 IN HOUSES IN PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION AND UNDER THE ARCHES OF THE BRIDGES ONE OF THESE NESTS WHICH HAS BECOME FAMOUS PRODUCED THE SWALLOWS OF THE BRIDGE OF ARCOLA THIS IS MOREOVER THE MOST DISASTROUS OF SOCIAL SYMPTOMS ALL CRIMES OF THE MAN BEGIN
3889-9915-0024 LET US MAKE AN EXCEPTION IN FAVOR OF PARIS NEVERTHELESS IN A RELATIVE MEASURE AND IN SPITE OF THE SOUVENIR WHICH WE HAVE JUST RECALLED THE EXCEPTION IS JUST
3889-9915-0025 THE STREET BOY OF PARIS WE INSIST ON THIS POINT HOWEVER DEFACED AND INJURED ON THE SURFACE IS ALMOST INTACT ON THE INTERIOR IT IS A MAGNIFICENT THING TO PUT ON RECORD
3889-9915-0026 AND ONE WHICH SHINES FORTH IN THE SPLENDID PROBITY OF OUR POPULAR REVOLUTIONS THAT A CERTAIN INCORRUPTIBILITY RESULTS FROM THE IDEA WHICH EXISTS IN THE AIR OF PARIS AS SALT EXISTS IN THE WATER OF THE OCEAN TO BREATHE PARIS
3889-9915-0027 PRESERVES THE SOUL WHAT WE HAVE JUST SAID TAKES AWAY NOTHING OF THE ANGUISH OF HEART WHICH ONE EXPERIENCES EVERY TIME THAT ONE MEETS ONE OF THESE CHILDREN AROUND WHOM ONE FANCIES THAT HE BEHOLDS FLOATING THE THREADS OF A BROKEN FAMILY
3889-9915-0028 IN THE CIVILIZATION OF THE PRESENT DAY INCOMPLETE AS IT STILL IS IT IS NOT A VERY ABNORMAL THING TO BEHOLD THESE FRACTURED FAMILIES POURING THEMSELVES OUT INTO THE DARKNESS NOT KNOWING CLEARLY WHAT HAS BECOME OF THEIR CHILDREN
3889-9915-0029 AND ALLOWING THEIR OWN ENTRAILS TO FALL ON THE PUBLIC HIGHWAY HENCE THESE OBSCURE DESTINIES THIS IS CALLED
3889-9915-0030 TO BE CAST ON THE PAVEMENTS OF PARIS LET IT BE SAID BY THE WAY THAT THIS ABANDONMENT OF CHILDREN WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BY THE ANCIENT MONARCHY A LITTLE OF EGYPT AND BOHEMIA IN THE LOWER REGIONS SUITED THE UPPER SPHERES
3889-9915-0031 AND COMPASSED THE AIMS OF THE POWERFUL THE HATRED OF INSTRUCTION FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE PEOPLE WAS A DOGMA WHAT IS THE USE OF HALF LIGHTS SUCH WAS THE COUNTERSIGN NOW THE ERRING CHILD IS THE COROLLARY OF THE IGNORANT CHILD
3889-9915-0032 BESIDES THIS THE MONARCHY SOMETIMES WAS IN NEED OF CHILDREN AND IN THAT CASE IT SKIMMED THE STREETS
3889-9915-0033 THE KING RIGHTLY DESIRED TO CREATE A FLEET THE IDEA WAS A GOOD ONE BUT LET US CONSIDER THE MEANS THERE CAN BE NO FLEET IF
3889-9915-0034 THAT PLAYTHING OF THE WINDS AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF TOWING IT IN CASE OF NECESSITY THERE IS NOT THE VESSEL WHICH GOES WHERE IT PLEASES EITHER BY MEANS OF OARS OR OF STEAM THE GALLEYS WERE THEN TO THE MARINE WHAT STEAMERS ARE TO DAY
3889-9915-0035 THEREFORE GALLEYS WERE NECESSARY BUT THE GALLEY IS MOVED ONLY BY THE GALLEY SLAVE HENCE GALLEY SLAVES WERE REQUIRED
3889-9915-0036 A MAN KEPT HIS HAT ON IN THE PRESENCE OF A PROCESSION IT WAS A HUGUENOT ATTITUDE HE WAS SENT TO THE GALLEYS A CHILD WAS ENCOUNTERED IN THE STREETS PROVIDED THAT HE WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE WAS TO SLEEP HE WAS SENT TO THE GALLEYS
3889-9915-0037 GRAND REIGN GRAND CENTURY
3889-9915-0038 THE POLICE CARRIED THEM OFF FOR WHAT MYSTERIOUS PURPOSE NO ONE KNEW PEOPLE WHISPERED WITH TERROR MONSTROUS CONJECTURES AS TO THE KING'S BATHS OF PURPLE BARBIER SPEAKS INGENUOUSLY OF THESE THINGS
3889-9915-0039 IT SOMETIMES HAPPENED THAT THE EXEMPTS OF THE GUARD WHEN THEY RAN SHORT OF CHILDREN TOOK THOSE WHO HAD FATHERS THE FATHERS IN DESPAIR ATTACKED THE EXEMPTS IN THAT CASE THE PARLIAMENT INTERVENED AND HAD SOME ONE HUNG
