77-121518-0000 AND NOW AS DAWN ROSE FROM HER COUCH BESIDE TITHONUS HARBINGER OF LIGHT ALIKE TO MORTALS AND IMMORTALS THE GODS MET IN COUNCIL AND WITH THEM JOVE THE LORD OF THUNDER WHO IS THEIR KING
77-121518-0001 THEREON MINERVA BEGAN TO TELL THEM OF THE MANY SUFFERINGS OF ULYSSES FOR SHE PITIED HIM AWAY THERE IN THE HOUSE OF THE NYMPH CALYPSO FATHER JOVE SAID SHE
77-121518-0002 AND ALL YOU OTHER GODS THAT LIVE IN EVERLASTING BLISS I HOPE THERE MAY NEVER BE SUCH A THING AS A KIND AND WELL DISPOSED RULER ANY MORE NOR ONE WHO WILL GOVERN EQUITABLY I HOPE
77-121518-0003 FOR THERE IS NOT ONE OF HIS SUBJECTS BUT HAS FORGOTTEN ULYSSES WHO RULED THEM AS THOUGH HE WERE THEIR FATHER THERE HE IS LYING IN GREAT PAIN IN AN ISLAND WHERE DWELLS THE NYMPH CALYPSO
77-121518-0004 WHO WILL NOT LET HIM GO AND HE CANNOT GET BACK TO HIS OWN COUNTRY FOR HE CAN FIND NEITHER SHIPS NOR SAILORS TO TAKE HIM OVER THE SEA FURTHERMORE
77-121518-0005 WICKED PEOPLE ARE NOW TRYING TO MURDER HIS ONLY SON TELEMACHUS WHO IS COMING HOME FROM PYLOS AND LACEDAEMON
77-121518-0006 OF HIS FATHER WHAT MY DEAR ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT REPLIED HER FATHER DID YOU NOT SEND HIM THERE YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP ULYSSES TO GET HOME AND PUNISH THE SUITORS
77-121518-0007 BESIDES YOU ARE PERFECTLY ABLE TO PROTECT TELEMACHUS AND TO SEE HIM SAFELY HOME AGAIN WHILE THE SUITORS HAVE TO COME HURRY SKURRYING BACK WITHOUT HAVING KILLED HIM
77-121518-0008 WHEN HE HAD THUS SPOKEN HE SAID TO HIS SON MERCURY MERCURY YOU ARE OUR MESSENGER GO THEREFORE AND TELL CALYPSO WE HAVE DECREED THAT POOR ULYSSES IS TO RETURN HOME
77-121518-0009 HE IS TO BE CONVOYED NEITHER BY GODS NOR MEN BUT AFTER A PERILOUS VOYAGE OF TWENTY DAYS UPON A RAFT
77-121518-0010 WHO ARE NEAR OF KIN TO THE GODS AND WILL HONOUR HIM AS THOUGH HE WERE ONE OF OURSELVES THEY WILL SEND HIM IN A SHIP TO HIS OWN COUNTRY AND WILL GIVE HIM MORE BRONZE AND GOLD AND RAIMENT THAN HE WOULD HAVE BROUGHT BACK FROM TROY
77-121518-0011 ALL HIS PRIZE MONEY AND HAD GOT HOME WITHOUT DISASTER THIS IS HOW WE HAVE SETTLED THAT HE SHALL RETURN TO HIS COUNTRY AND HIS FRIENDS THUS HE SPOKE AND MERCURY GUIDE AND GUARDIAN SLAYER OF ARGUS
77-121518-0012 DID AS HE WAS TOLD FORTHWITH HE BOUND ON HIS GLITTERING GOLDEN SANDALS WITH WHICH HE COULD FLY LIKE THE WIND OVER LAND AND SEA HE TOOK THE WAND WITH WHICH HE SEALS MEN'S EYES IN SLEEP
77-121518-0013 OR WAKES THEM JUST AS HE PLEASES
77-121518-0014 WHOSE WAVES HE SKIMMED LIKE A CORMORANT THAT FLIES FISHING EVERY HOLE AND CORNER OF THE OCEAN AND DRENCHING ITS THICK PLUMAGE IN THE SPRAY HE FLEW AND FLEW OVER MANY A WEARY WAVE BUT WHEN AT LAST
77-121518-0015 HE GOT TO THE ISLAND WHICH WAS HIS JOURNEY'S END HE LEFT THE SEA AND WENT ON BY LAND TILL HE CAME TO THE CAVE WHERE THE NYMPH CALYPSO LIVED HE FOUND HER AT HOME THERE WAS A LARGE FIRE BURNING ON THE HEARTH
77-121518-0016 AND ONE COULD SMELL FROM FAR THE FRAGRANT REEK OF BURNING CEDAR AND SANDAL WOOD AS FOR HERSELF SHE WAS BUSY AT HER LOOM SHOOTING HER GOLDEN SHUTTLE THROUGH THE WARP AND SINGING BEAUTIFULLY ROUND HER CAVE THERE WAS A THICK WOOD OF ALDER
77-121518-0017 POPLAR AND SWEET SMELLING CYPRESS TREES WHEREIN ALL KINDS OF GREAT BIRDS HAD BUILT THEIR NESTS OWLS HAWKS AND CHATTERING SEA CROWS THAT OCCUPY THEIR BUSINESS IN THE WATERS
77-121518-0018 A VINE LOADED WITH GRAPES WAS TRAINED AND GREW LUXURIANTLY ABOUT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE
77-121518-0019 AND TURNED HITHER AND THITHER
77-121518-0020 SO MERCURY STOOD STILL AND LOOKED AT IT BUT WHEN HE HAD ADMIRED IT SUFFICIENTLY HE WENT INSIDE THE CAVE CALYPSO KNEW HIM AT ONCE FOR THE GODS ALL KNOW EACH OTHER NO MATTER HOW FAR THEY LIVE FROM ONE ANOTHER
77-121518-0021 BUT ULYSSES WAS NOT WITHIN HE WAS ON THE SEA SHORE AS USUAL LOOKING OUT UPON THE BARREN OCEAN WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES GROANING AND BREAKING HIS HEART FOR SORROW CALYPSO GAVE MERCURY A SEAT AND SAID
77-121518-0022 WHY HAVE YOU COME TO SEE ME MERCURY HONOURED AND EVER WELCOME FOR YOU DO NOT VISIT ME OFTEN SAY WHAT YOU WANT I WILL DO IT FOR YOU AT ONCE IF I CAN AND IF IT CAN BE DONE AT ALL BUT COME INSIDE
77-121518-0023 AND LET ME SET REFRESHMENT BEFORE YOU AS SHE SPOKE SHE DREW A TABLE LOADED WITH AMBROSIA BESIDE HIM AND MIXED HIM SOME RED NECTAR SO MERCURY ATE AND DRANK TILL HE HAD HAD ENOUGH
77-121518-0024 AND THEN SAID WE ARE SPEAKING GOD AND GODDESS TO ONE ANOTHER AND YOU ASK ME WHY I HAVE COME HERE AND I WILL TELL YOU TRULY AS YOU WOULD HAVE ME DO JOVE SENT ME IT WAS NO DOING OF MINE
77-121518-0025 WHO COULD POSSIBLY WANT TO COME ALL THIS WAY OVER THE SEA WHERE THERE ARE NO CITIES FULL OF PEOPLE TO OFFER ME SACRIFICES OR CHOICE HECATOMBS
77-121518-0026 HIS ORDERS HE SAYS THAT YOU HAVE HERE THE MOST ILL STARRED OF ALL THOSE WHO FOUGHT NINE YEARS BEFORE THE CITY OF KING PRIAM AND SAILED HOME IN THE TENTH YEAR AFTER HAVING SACKED IT
77-121518-0027 SO THAT ALL HIS BRAVE COMPANIONS PERISHED AND HE ALONE WAS CARRIED HITHER BY WIND AND TIDE JOVE SAYS THAT YOU ARE TO LET THIS MAN GO AT ONCE FOR IT IS DECREED THAT HE SHALL NOT PERISH HERE FAR FROM HIS OWN PEOPLE
77-121518-0028 BUT SHALL RETURN TO HIS HOUSE AND COUNTRY AND SEE HIS FRIENDS AGAIN CALYPSO TREMBLED WITH RAGE WHEN SHE HEARD THIS YOU GODS SHE EXCLAIMED OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES
77-121518-0029 YOU ARE ALWAYS JEALOUS AND HATE SEEING A GODDESS TAKE A FANCY TO A MORTAL MAN AND LIVE WITH HIM IN OPEN MATRIMONY SO WHEN ROSY FINGERED DAWN MADE LOVE TO ORION
77-121518-0030 SO AGAIN WHEN CERES FELL IN LOVE WITH IASION AND YIELDED TO HIM IN A THRICE PLOUGHED FALLOW FIELD
77-121518-0031 AND NOW YOU ARE ANGRY WITH ME TOO BECAUSE I HAVE A MAN HERE I FOUND THE POOR CREATURE SITTING ALL ALONE ASTRIDE OF A KEEL FOR JOVE HAD STRUCK HIS SHIP WITH LIGHTNING AND SUNK IT IN MID OCEAN
77-121518-0032 SO THAT ALL HIS CREW WERE DROWNED WHILE HE HIMSELF WAS DRIVEN BY WIND AND WAVES ON TO MY ISLAND I GOT FOND OF HIM AND CHERISHED HIM AND HAD SET MY HEART ON MAKING HIM IMMORTAL SO THAT HE SHOULD NEVER GROW OLD ALL HIS DAYS
77-121518-0033 STILL I CANNOT CROSS JOVE NOR BRING HIS COUNSELS TO NOTHING THEREFORE IF HE INSISTS UPON IT LET THE MAN GO BEYOND THE SEAS AGAIN BUT I CANNOT SEND HIM ANYWHERE MYSELF FOR I HAVE NEITHER SHIPS NOR MEN WHO CAN TAKE HIM
77-121518-0034 NEVERTHELESS I WILL READILY GIVE HIM SUCH ADVICE IN ALL GOOD FAITH AS WILL BE LIKELY TO BRING HIM SAFELY TO HIS OWN COUNTRY THEN SEND HIM AWAY SAID MERCURY OR JOVE WILL BE ANGRY WITH YOU AND PUNISH YOU ON THIS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE
77-121518-0035 AND CALYPSO WENT OUT TO LOOK FOR ULYSSES FOR SHE HAD HEARD JOVE'S MESSAGE SHE FOUND HIM SITTING UPON THE BEACH WITH HIS EYES EVER FILLED WITH TEARS AND DYING OF SHEER HOME SICKNESS
77-121518-0036 THAT WOULD HAVE IT SO AS FOR THE DAY TIME HE SPENT IT ON THE ROCKS AND ON THE SEA SHORE WEEPING CRYING ALOUD FOR HIS DESPAIR AND ALWAYS LOOKING OUT UPON THE SEA
77-121518-0037 SO GO CUT SOME BEAMS OF WOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF A LARGE RAFT WITH AN UPPER DECK THAT IT MAY CARRY YOU SAFELY OVER THE SEA I WILL PUT BREAD WINE AND WATER ON BOARD TO SAVE YOU FROM STARVING I WILL ALSO GIVE YOU CLOTHES
77-121518-0038 AND WILL SEND YOU A FAIR WIND TO TAKE YOU HOME IF THE GODS IN HEAVEN SO WILL IT FOR THEY KNOW MORE ABOUT THESE THINGS AND CAN SETTLE THEM BETTER THAN I CAN ULYSSES SHUDDERED AS HE HEARD HER NOW GODDESS HE ANSWERED
77-121518-0039 NOT EVEN A WELL FOUND SHIP WITH A FAIR WIND COULD VENTURE ON SUCH A DISTANT VOYAGE NOTHING THAT YOU CAN SAY OR DO SHALL MAKE ME GO ON BOARD A RAFT UNLESS YOU FIRST SOLEMNLY SWEAR
77-121518-0040 CALYPSO SMILED AT THIS AND CARESSED HIM WITH HER HAND YOU KNOW A GREAT DEAL SAID SHE BUT YOU ARE QUITE WRONG HERE MAY HEAVEN ABOVE AND EARTH BELOW BE MY WITNESSES WITH THE WATERS OF THE RIVER STYX
77-121518-0041 THAT I MEAN YOU NO SORT OF HARM AND AM ONLY ADVISING YOU TO DO EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD DO MYSELF IN YOUR PLACE I AM DEALING WITH YOU QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARDLY
77-121518-0042 AND I AM VERY SORRY FOR YOU WHEN SHE HAD THUS SPOKEN SHE LED THE WAY RAPIDLY BEFORE HIM AND ULYSSES FOLLOWED IN HER STEPS SO THE PAIR GODDESS AND MAN WENT ON AND ON TILL THEY CAME TO CALYPSO'S CAVE
77-121518-0043 CALYPSO SET MEAT AND DRINK BEFORE HIM OF THE FOOD THAT MORTALS EAT BUT HER MAIDS BROUGHT AMBROSIA AND NECTAR FOR HERSELF AND THEY LAID THEIR HANDS ON THE GOOD THINGS THAT WERE BEFORE THEM
77-121518-0044 WHEN THEY HAD SATISFIED THEMSELVES WITH MEAT AND DRINK CALYPSO SPOKE SAYING
77-121518-0045 HE CUT DOWN TWENTY TREES IN ALL AND ADZED THEM SMOOTH SQUARING THEM BY RULE IN GOOD WORKMANLIKE FASHION MEANWHILE CALYPSO CAME BACK WITH SOME AUGERS SO HE BORED HOLES WITH THEM AND FITTED THE TIMBERS TOGETHER WITH BOLTS AND RIVETS
77-121518-0046 HE MADE THE RAFT AS BROAD AS A SKILLED SHIPWRIGHT
77-121518-0047 HE ALSO MADE A MAST WITH A YARD ARM AND A RUDDER TO STEER WITH HE FENCED THE RAFT ALL ROUND WITH WICKER HURDLES AS A PROTECTION AGAINST THE WAVES AND THEN HE THREW ON A QUANTITY OF WOOD BY AND BY
77-121518-0048 CALYPSO BROUGHT HIM SOME LINEN TO MAKE THE SAILS AND HE MADE THESE TOO EXCELLENTLY MAKING THEM FAST WITH BRACES AND SHEETS LAST OF ALL WITH THE HELP OF LEVERS HE DREW THE RAFT DOWN INTO THE WATER IN FOUR DAYS
77-121518-0049 HE HAD COMPLETED THE WHOLE WORK AND ON THE FIFTH CALYPSO SENT HIM FROM THE ISLAND AFTER WASHING HIM AND GIVING HIM SOME CLEAN CLOTHES SHE GAVE HIM A GOAT SKIN FULL OF BLACK WINE AND ANOTHER LARGER ONE OF WATER
77-121518-0050 MOREOVER SHE MADE THE WIND FAIR AND WARM FOR HIM AND GLADLY DID ULYSSES SPREAD HIS SAIL BEFORE IT WHILE HE SAT AND GUIDED THE RAFT SKILFULLY BY MEANS OF THE RUDDER
77-121518-0051 ON LATE SETTING BOOTES AND ON THE BEAR WHICH MEN ALSO CALL THE WAIN AND WHICH TURNS ROUND AND ROUND WHERE IT IS FACING ORION AND ALONE NEVER DIPPING INTO THE STREAM OF OCEANUS FOR CALYPSO HAD TOLD HIM TO KEEP THIS TO HIS LEFT
77-121518-0052 DAYS SEVEN AND TEN DID HE SAIL OVER THE SEA AND ON THE EIGHTEENTH THE DIM OUTLINES OF THE MOUNTAINS ON THE NEAREST PART OF THE PHAEACIAN COAST APPEARED RISING LIKE A SHIELD ON THE HORIZON
77-121518-0053 BUT KING NEPTUNE WHO WAS RETURNING FROM THE ETHIOPIANS CAUGHT SIGHT OF ULYSSES A LONG WAY OFF FROM THE MOUNTAINS OF THE SOLYMI HE COULD SEE HIM SAILING UPON THE SEA AND IT MADE HIM VERY ANGRY
77-121518-0054 AND NOW HE IS CLOSE TO THE LAND OF THE PHAEACIANS WHERE IT IS DECREED THAT HE SHALL ESCAPE FROM THE CALAMITIES THAT HAVE BEFALLEN HIM STILL HE SHALL HAVE PLENTY OF HARDSHIP YET BEFORE HE HAS DONE WITH IT
77-121518-0055 THEREON HE GATHERED HIS CLOUDS TOGETHER GRASPED HIS TRIDENT STIRRED IT ROUND IN THE SEA AND ROUSED THE RAGE OF EVERY WIND THAT BLOWS TILL EARTH SEA AND SKY WERE HIDDEN IN CLOUD AND NIGHT SPRANG FORTH OUT OF THE HEAVENS
77-121518-0056 WINDS FROM EAST SOUTH NORTH AND WEST FELL UPON HIM ALL AT THE SAME TIME AND A TREMENDOUS SEA GOT UP SO THAT ULYSSES HEART BEGAN TO FAIL HIM ALAS HE SAID TO HIMSELF IN HIS DISMAY WHAT EVER WILL BECOME OF ME
77-121518-0057 I AM AFRAID CALYPSO WAS RIGHT WHEN SHE SAID I SHOULD HAVE TROUBLE BY SEA BEFORE I GOT BACK HOME IT IS ALL COMING TRUE HOW BLACK IS JOVE MAKING HEAVEN WITH HIS CLOUDS AND WHAT A SEA THE WINDS ARE RAISING FROM EVERY QUARTER AT ONCE
77-121518-0058 I AM NOW SAFE TO PERISH BLEST AND THRICE BLEST WERE THOSE DANAANS WHO FELL BEFORE TROY IN THE CAUSE OF THE SONS OF ATREUS WOULD THAT I HAD BEEN KILLED ON THE DAY WHEN THE TROJANS WERE PRESSING ME SO SORELY ABOUT THE DEAD BODY OF ACHILLES
77-121518-0059 AS HE SPOKE A SEA BROKE OVER HIM WITH SUCH TERRIFIC FURY THAT THE RAFT REELED AGAIN AND HE WAS CARRIED OVERBOARD A LONG WAY OFF
77-121518-0060 THAT IT BROKE THE MAST HALF WAY UP AND BOTH SAIL AND YARD WENT OVER INTO THE SEA FOR A LONG TIME ULYSSES WAS UNDER WATER
77-121518-0061 BUT AT LAST HE GOT HIS HEAD ABOVE WATER AND SPAT OUT THE BITTER BRINE THAT WAS RUNNING DOWN HIS FACE IN STREAMS IN SPITE OF ALL THIS HOWEVER
77-121518-0062 HE DID NOT LOSE SIGHT OF HIS RAFT BUT SWAM AS FAST AS HE COULD TOWARDS IT GOT HOLD OF IT AND CLIMBED ON BOARD AGAIN SO AS TO ESCAPE DROWNING THE SEA TOOK THE RAFT AND TOSSED IT ABOUT AS AUTUMN WINDS WHIRL THISTLEDOWN ROUND AND ROUND UPON A ROAD
77-121518-0063 IT WAS AS THOUGH THE SOUTH NORTH EAST AND WEST WINDS WERE ALL PLAYING BATTLEDORE AND SHUTTLECOCK WITH IT AT ONCE
77-121518-0064 WHEN HE WAS IN THIS PLIGHT INO DAUGHTER OF CADMUS ALSO CALLED LEUCOTHEA SAW HIM SHE HAD FORMERLY BEEN A MERE MORTAL BUT HAD BEEN SINCE RAISED TO THE RANK OF A MARINE GODDESS
77-121518-0065 SEEING IN WHAT GREAT DISTRESS ULYSSES NOW WAS SHE HAD COMPASSION UPON HIM AND RISING LIKE A SEA GULL FROM THE WAVES TOOK HER SEAT UPON THE RAFT MY POOR GOOD MAN SAID SHE
77-121518-0066 WHY IS NEPTUNE SO FURIOUSLY ANGRY WITH YOU HE IS GIVING YOU A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE BUT FOR ALL HIS BLUSTER HE WILL NOT KILL YOU YOU SEEM TO BE A SENSIBLE PERSON DO THEN AS I BID YOU STRIP
77-121518-0067 LEAVE YOUR RAFT TO DRIVE BEFORE THE WIND AND SWIM TO THE PHAEACIAN COAST WHERE BETTER LUCK AWAITS YOU AND HERE TAKE MY VEIL AND PUT IT ROUND YOUR CHEST IT IS ENCHANTED AND YOU CAN COME TO NO HARM SO LONG AS YOU WEAR IT
77-121518-0068 AS SOON AS YOU TOUCH LAND TAKE IT OFF THROW IT BACK AS FAR AS YOU CAN INTO THE SEA AND THEN GO AWAY AGAIN WITH THESE WORDS
77-121518-0069 THEN SHE DIVED DOWN AGAIN LIKE A SEA GULL AND VANISHED BENEATH THE DARK BLUE WATERS BUT ULYSSES DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK ALAS HE SAID TO HIMSELF IN HIS DISMAY
77-121518-0070 THIS IS ONLY SOME ONE OR OTHER OF THE GODS WHO IS LURING ME TO RUIN BY ADVISING ME TO QUIT MY RAFT AT ANY RATE I WILL NOT DO SO AT PRESENT FOR THE LAND WHERE SHE SAID I SHOULD BE QUIT OF ALL TROUBLES
77-121518-0071 SEEMED TO BE STILL A GOOD WAY OFF I KNOW WHAT I WILL DO I AM SURE IT WILL BE BEST NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS I WILL STICK TO THE RAFT AS LONG AS HER TIMBERS HOLD TOGETHER BUT WHEN THE SEA BREAKS HER UP I WILL SWIM FOR IT
77-121518-0072 I DO NOT SEE HOW I CAN DO ANY BETTER THAN THIS WHILE HE WAS THUS IN TWO MINDS NEPTUNE SENT A TERRIBLE GREAT WAVE THAT SEEMED TO REAR ITSELF ABOVE HIS HEAD TILL IT BROKE RIGHT OVER THE RAFT
77-121518-0073 WHICH THEN WENT TO PIECES AS THOUGH IT WERE A HEAP OF DRY CHAFF TOSSED ABOUT BY A WHIRLWIND ULYSSES GOT ASTRIDE OF ONE PLANK AND RODE UPON IT AS IF HE WERE ON HORSEBACK HE THEN TOOK OFF THE CLOTHES CALYPSO HAD GIVEN HIM
77-121518-0074 BOUND INO'S VEIL UNDER HIS ARMS AND PLUNGED INTO THE SEA MEANING TO SWIM ON SHORE KING NEPTUNE WATCHED HIM AS HE DID SO AND WAGGED HIS HEAD MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AND SAYING THERE NOW SWIM UP AND DOWN AS YOU BEST CAN
77-121518-0075 I DO NOT THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I HAVE LET YOU OFF TOO LIGHTLY ON THIS HE LASHED HIS HORSES
77-121518-0076 BUT MINERVA RESOLVED TO HELP ULYSSES SO SHE BOUND THE WAYS OF ALL THE WINDS EXCEPT ONE AND MADE THEM LIE QUITE STILL BUT SHE ROUSED A GOOD STIFF BREEZE FROM THE NORTH THAT SHOULD LAY THE WATERS TILL ULYSSES REACHED THE LAND OF THE PHAEACIANS WHERE HE WOULD BE SAFE
77-121518-0077 THEREON HE FLOATED ABOUT FOR TWO NIGHTS AND TWO DAYS IN THE WATER WITH A HEAVY SWELL ON THE SEA AND DEATH STARING HIM IN THE FACE BUT WHEN THE THIRD DAY BROKE THE WIND FELL AND THERE WAS A DEAD CALM WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A BREATH OF AIR STIRRING
77-121518-0078 AS HE ROSE ON THE SWELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY AHEAD AND COULD SEE LAND QUITE NEAR THEN AS CHILDREN REJOICE WHEN THEIR DEAR FATHER BEGINS TO GET BETTER AFTER HAVING FOR A LONG TIME BORNE SORE AFFLICTION SENT HIM BY SOME ANGRY SPIRIT
77-121518-0079 BUT THE GODS DELIVER HIM FROM EVIL SO WAS ULYSSES THANKFUL WHEN HE AGAIN SAW LAND AND TREES AND SWAM ON WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH THAT HE MIGHT ONCE MORE SET FOOT UPON DRY GROUND
77-121518-0080 FOR THE SWELL STILL BROKE AGAINST THEM WITH A TERRIFIC ROAR EVERYTHING WAS ENVELOPED IN SPRAY THERE WERE NO HARBOURS WHERE A SHIP MIGHT RIDE NOR SHELTER OF ANY KIND BUT ONLY HEADLANDS
77-121518-0081 LOW LYING ROCKS AND MOUNTAIN TOPS ULYSSES HEART NOW BEGAN TO FAIL HIM AND HE SAID DESPAIRINGLY TO HIMSELF ALAS JOVE HAS LET ME SEE LAND AFTER SWIMMING SO FAR THAT I HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE
77-121518-0082 BUT I CAN FIND NO LANDING PLACE FOR THE COAST IS ROCKY AND SURF BEATEN THE ROCKS ARE SMOOTH AND RISE SHEER FROM THE SEA WITH DEEP WATER CLOSE UNDER THEM SO THAT I CANNOT CLIMB OUT FOR WANT OF FOOT HOLD
77-121518-0083 I AM AFRAID SOME GREAT WAVE WILL LIFT ME OFF MY LEGS AND DASH ME AGAINST THE ROCKS AS I LEAVE THE WATER WHICH WOULD GIVE ME A SORRY LANDING IF ON THE OTHER HAND I SWIM FURTHER IN SEARCH OF SOME SHELVING BEACH OR HARBOUR
77-121518-0084 A HURRICANE MAY CARRY ME OUT TO SEA AGAIN SORELY AGAINST MY WILL OR HEAVEN MAY SEND SOME GREAT MONSTER OF THE DEEP TO ATTACK ME FOR AMPHITRITE
77-121518-0085 BREEDS MANY SUCH AND I KNOW THAT NEPTUNE IS VERY ANGRY WITH ME WHILE HE WAS THUS IN TWO MINDS A WAVE CAUGHT HIM AND TOOK HIM WITH SUCH FORCE
77-121518-0086 AGAINST THE ROCKS THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SMASHED AND TORN TO PIECES IF MINERVA HAD NOT SHOWN HIM WHAT TO DO HE CAUGHT HOLD OF THE ROCK WITH BOTH HANDS AND CLUNG TO IT GROANING WITH PAIN TILL THE WAVE RETIRED SO HE WAS SAVED THAT TIME
77-121518-0087 BUT PRESENTLY THE WAVE CAME ON AGAIN AND CARRIED HIM BACK WITH IT FAR INTO THE SEA TEARING HIS HANDS AS THE SUCKERS OF A POLYPUS ARE TORN WHEN SOME ONE PLUCKS IT FROM ITS BED
77-121518-0088 AND THE STONES COME UP ALONG WITH IT EVEN SO DID THE ROCKS TEAR THE SKIN FROM HIS STRONG HANDS AND THEN THE WAVE DREW HIM DEEP DOWN UNDER THE WATER HERE
77-121518-0089 POOR ULYSSES WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY PERISHED EVEN IN SPITE OF HIS OWN DESTINY IF MINERVA HAD NOT HELPED HIM TO KEEP HIS WITS ABOUT HIM HE SWAM SEAWARD AGAIN BEYOND REACH OF THE SURF THAT WAS BEATING AGAINST THE LAND
77-121518-0090 AND AT THE SAME TIME HE KEPT LOOKING TOWARDS THE SHORE TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND SOME HAVEN OR A SPIT THAT SHOULD TAKE THE WAVES ASLANT BY AND BY AS HE SWAM ON HE CAME TO THE MOUTH OF A RIVER
77-121518-0091 AND HERE HE THOUGHT WOULD BE THE BEST PLACE FOR THERE WERE NO ROCKS AND IT AFFORDED SHELTER FROM THE WIND HE FELT THAT THERE WAS A CURRENT SO HE PRAYED INWARDLY AND SAID HEAR ME O KING WHOEVER YOU MAY BE
77-121518-0092 AND SAVE ME FROM THE ANGER OF THE SEA GOD NEPTUNE FOR I APPROACH YOU PRAYERFULLY ANY ONE WHO HAS LOST HIS WAY HAS AT ALL TIMES A CLAIM EVEN UPON THE GODS
77-121518-0093 HAVE MERCY UPON ME O KING FOR I DECLARE MYSELF YOUR SUPPLIANT THEN THE GOD STAID HIS STREAM AND STILLED THE WAVES MAKING ALL CALM BEFORE HIM AND BRINGING HIM SAFELY INTO THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER HERE
77-121518-0094 AT LAST ULYSSES KNEES AND STRONG HANDS FAILED HIM FOR THE SEA HAD COMPLETELY BROKEN HIM HIS BODY WAS ALL SWOLLEN
77-121518-0095 SO THAT HE COULD NEITHER BREATHE
77-121518-0096 WHEREON INO RECEIVED IT INTO HER HANDS FROM THE WAVE THAT BORE IT TOWARDS HER THEN HE LEFT THE RIVER LAID HIMSELF DOWN AMONG THE RUSHES AND KISSED
77-121518-0097 THE BOUNTEOUS EARTH ALAS HE CRIED TO HIMSELF IN HIS DISMAY WHAT EVER WILL BECOME OF ME AND HOW IS IT ALL TO END IF I STAY HERE UPON THE RIVER BED THROUGH THE LONG WATCHES OF THE NIGHT
77-121518-0098 I AM SO EXHAUSTED THAT THE BITTER COLD AND DAMP MAY MAKE AN END OF ME FOR TOWARDS SUNRISE THERE WILL BE A KEEN WIND BLOWING FROM OFF THE RIVER IF ON THE OTHER HAND I CLIMB THE HILL SIDE FIND SHELTER IN THE WOODS AND SLEEP IN SOME THICKET
77-121518-0099 I MAY ESCAPE THE COLD AND HAVE A GOOD NIGHT'S REST BUT SOME SAVAGE BEAST MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME AND DEVOUR ME
77-121518-0100 THERE HE CREPT BENEATH TWO SHOOTS OF OLIVE THAT GREW FROM A SINGLE STOCK THE ONE AN UNGRAFTED SUCKER WHILE THE OTHER HAD BEEN GRAFTED NO WIND HOWEVER SQUALLY
77-121518-0101 FOR THERE WAS A GREAT LITTER OF DEAD LEAVES LYING ABOUT ENOUGH TO MAKE A COVERING FOR TWO OR THREE MEN EVEN IN HARD WINTER WEATHER HE WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO SEE THIS SO HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN AND HEAPED THE LEAVES ALL ROUND HIM
77-121518-0102 THEN AS ONE WHO LIVES ALONE IN THE COUNTRY FAR FROM ANY NEIGHBOR HIDES A BRAND AS FIRE SEED IN THE ASHES TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM HAVING TO GET A LIGHT ELSEWHERE
