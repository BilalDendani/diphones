2045-158081-0000 AN ADMINISTRATION PROTEST DUDLEY FIELD MALONE RESIGNS DUDLEY FIELD MALONE WAS KNOWN TO THE COUNTRY AS SHARING THE INTIMATE CONFIDENCE AND FRIENDSHIP OF PRESIDENT WILSON
2045-158081-0001 HE HAD KNOWN AND SUPPORTED THE PRESIDENT FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESIDENT'S POLITICAL CAREER HE HAD CAMPAIGNED TWICE THROUGH NEW JERSEY WITH MISTER WILSON AS GOVERNOR HE HAD MANAGED MISTER WILSON'S CAMPAIGNS IN MANY STATES FOR THE NOMINATION BEFORE THE BALTIMORE CONVENTION
2045-158081-0002 HE HAD TOURED THE COUNTRY WITH MISTER WILSON IN NINETEEN TWELVE AND IT WAS HE WHO LED TO VICTORY PRESIDENT WILSON'S FIGHT FOR CALIFORNIA IN NINETEEN SIXTEEN SO WHEN MISTER MALONE WENT TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN JULY NINETEEN SEVENTEEN
2045-158081-0003 TO PROTEST AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATION'S HANDLING OF THE SUFFRAGE QUESTION HE WENT NOT ONLY AS A CONFIRMED SUFFRAGIST
2045-158081-0004 THE ONE WHO HAD BEEN CHOSEN TO GO TO THE WEST IN NINETEEN SIXTEEN TO WIN WOMEN VOTERS TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY MISTER MALONE HAS CONSENTED TO TELL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS RECORD OF THE MILITANT CAMPAIGN
2045-158081-0005 WHAT HAPPENED AT HIS MEMORABLE INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT WILSON IN JULY NINETEEN SEVENTEEN AN INTERVIEW WHICH HE FOLLOWED UP TWO MONTHS LATER WITH HIS RESIGNATION AS COLLECTOR OF THE PORT OF NEW YORK I QUOTE THE STORY IN HIS OWN WORDS
2045-158081-0006 FRANK P WALSH AMOS PINCHOT FREDERIC C HOWE J A H HOPKINS ALLEN MC CURDY AND I
2045-158081-0007 I WENT OVER TO ANNE MARTIN ONE OF THE WOMEN'S COUNSEL AND OFFERED TO ACT AS ATTORNEY ON THE APPEAL OF THE CASE I THEN WENT TO THE COURT CLERK'S OFFICE AND TELEPHONED TO PRESIDENT WILSON AT THE WHIT HOUSE ASKING HIM TO SEE ME AT ONCE IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK
2045-158081-0008 I CALLED A TAXICAB DROVE DIRECT TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICES AND MET HIM I BEGAN BY REMINDING THE PRESIDENT THAT IN THE SEVEN YEARS AND A HALF OF OUR PERSONAL AND POLITICAL ASSOCIATION WE HAD NEVER HAD A SERIOUS DIFFERENCE
2045-158081-0009 HE WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO SAY THAT MY LOYALTY TO HIM BAD BEEN ONE OF THE HAPPIEST CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS PUBLIC CAREER BUT I TOLD HIM I HAD COME TO PLACE MY RESIGNATION IN HIS HANDS AS I COULD NOT REMAIN A MEMBER OF ANY ADMINISTRATION WHICH DARED TO SEND AMERICAN WOMEN TO PRISON
2045-158081-0010 FOR DEMANDING NATIONAL SUFFRAGE I ALSO INFORMED HIM THAT I HAD OFFERED TO ACT AS COUNSEL FOR THE SUFFRAGISTS ON THE APPEAL OF THEIR CASE HE ASKED ME FOR FULL DETAILS OF MY COMPLAINT AND ATTITUDE
2045-158081-0011 I TOLD MISTER WILSON EVERYTHING I HAD WITNESSED FROM THE TIME WE SAW THE SUFFRAGISTS ARRESTED IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE TO THEIR SENTENCE IN THE POLICE COURT I OBSERVED THAT ALTHOUGH WE MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH THE MANNERS OF PICKETING CITIZENS HAD A RIGHT TO PETITION THE PRESIDENT
2045-158081-0012 OR ANY OTHER OFFICIAL OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR A REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES HE SEEMED TO ACQUIESCE IN THIS VIEW AND REMINDED ME THAT THE WOMEN HAD BEEN UNMOLESTED AT THE WHITE HOUSE GATES FOR OVER FIVE MONTHS ADDING THAT HE HAD EVEN ORDERED THE HEAD USHER TO INVITE THE WOMEN ON COLD DAYS TO COME INTO THE WHITE HOUSE
2045-158081-0013 AND WARM THEMSELVES AND HAVE COFFEE IF THE SITUATION IS AS YOU DESCRIBE IT IT IS SHOCKING SAID THE PRESIDENT
2045-158081-0014 THE MANHANDLING OF THE WOMEN BY THE POLICE WAS OUTRAGEOUS AND THE ENTIRE TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OF YOUR OWN APPOINTMENT WAS A PERVERSION OF JUSTICE I SAID THIS SEEMED TO ANNOY THE PRESIDENT AND HE REPLIED WITH ASPERITY
2045-158081-0015 DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME HE SAID THAT YOU INTEND TO RESIGN TO REPUDIATE ME AND MY ADMINISTRATION AND SACRIFICE ME FOR YOUR VIEWS ON THIS SUFFRAGE QUESTION HIS ATTITUDE THEN ANGERED ME AND I SAID MISTER PRESIDENT
2045-158081-0016 IF THERE IS ANY SACRIFICE IN THIS UNHAPPY CIRCUMSTANCE IT IS I WHO AM MAKING THE SACRIFICE I WAS SENT TWICE AS YOUR SPOKESMAN IN THE LAST CAMPAIGN TO THE WOMAN SUFFRAGE STATES OF THE WEST YOU HAVE SINCE BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO SAY PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY
2045-158081-0017 THAT I DID AS MUCH AS ANY MAN TO CARRY CALIFORNIA FOR YOU AFTER MY FIRST TOUR I HAD A LONG CONFERENCE WITH YOU HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE ON THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN THOSE STATES I TOLD YOU THAT I FOUND YOUR STRENGTH WITH WOMEN VOTERS
2045-158081-0018 LAY IN THE FACT THAT YOU HAD WITH GREAT PATIENCE AND STATESMANSHIP KEPT THIS COUNTRY OUT OF THE EUROPEAN WAR BUT THAT YOUR GREAT WEAKNESS WITH WOMEN VOTERS WAS THAT YOU HAD NOT TAKEN ANY STEP THROUGHOUT YOUR ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION TO URGE THE PASSAGE OF THE FEDERAL SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT
2045-158081-0019 WHICH MISTER HUGHES WAS ADVOCATING AND WHICH ALONE CAN ENFRANCHISE ALL THE WOMEN OF THE NATION YOU ASKED ME THEN HOW I MET THIS SITUATION AND I TOLD YOU THAT I PROMISED THE WOMEN VOTERS OF THE WEST
2045-158081-0020 TO CHOOSE YOU AS AGAINST MISTER HUGHES I WOULD DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO GET YOUR ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE UP AND PASS THE SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT YOU WERE PLEASED AND APPROVED OF WHAT I HAD DONE I RETURNED TO CALIFORNIA AND REPEATED THIS PROMISE AND SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED
2045-158081-0021 I MUST KEEP MY PART OF THAT OBLIGATION I REITERATED TO THE PRESIDENT MY EARLIER APPEAL THAT HE ASSIST SUFFRAGE AS AN URGENT WAR MEASURE AND A NECESSARY PART OF AMERICA'S PROGRAM FOR WORLD DEMOCRACY TO WHICH THE PRESIDENT REPLIED
2045-158081-0022 THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF WOMEN IS NOT AT ALL NECESSARY TO A PROGRAM OF DEMOCRACY
2045-158081-0023 UNLESS YOU MEAN THAT AMERICAN WOMEN WILL NOT LOYALLY SUPPORT THE WAR UNLESS THEY ARE GIVEN THE VOTE I FIRMLY DENIED THIS CONCLUSION OF THE PRESIDENT AND TOLD HIM THAT WHILE AMERICAN WOMEN WITH OR WITHOUT THE VOTE WOULD SUPPORT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AGAINST GERMAN MILITARISM
2045-158081-0024 YET IT SEEMED TO ME A GREAT OPPORTUNITY OF HIS LEADERSHIP TO REMOVE THIS GRIEVANCE WHICH WOMEN GENERALLY FELT AGAINST HIM AND HIS ADMINISTRATION MISTER PRESIDENT I URGED IF YOU AS THE LEADER WILL PERSUADE THE ADMINISTRATION TO PASS THE FEDERAL AMENDMENT
2045-158081-0025 YOU WILL RELEASE FROM THE SUFFRAGE FIGHT THE ENERGIES OF THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WHICH WILL BE GIVEN WITH REDOUBLED ZEAL TO THE SUPPORT OF YOUR PROGRAM FOR INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE BUT THE PRESIDENT ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO ADMIT THE VALIDITY OF MY APPEAL THOUGH IT WAS AS A WAR MEASURE
2045-158081-0026 THAT THE PRESIDENT SOME MONTHS LATER DEMANDED THAT THE SENATE PASS THE SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT THE PRESIDENT WAS VISIBLY MOVED AS I ADDED YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT NOW REELECTED TO OFFICE YOU ASK IF I AM GOING TO SACRIFICE YOU
2045-158081-0027 YOU SACRIFICE NOTHING BY MY RESIGNATION BUT I LOSE MUCH I QUIT A POLITICAL CAREER I GIVE UP A POWERFUL OFFICE IN MY OWN STATE I WHO HAVE NO MONEY SACRIFICE A LUCRATIVE SALARY
2045-158081-0028 BUT MOST OF ALL I SEVER A PERSONAL ASSOCIATION WITH YOU OF THE DEEPEST AFFECTION WHICH YOU KNOW HAS MEANT MUCH TO ME THESE PAST SEVEN YEARS BUT I CANNOT AND WILL NOT REMAIN IN OFFICE AND SEE WOMEN
2045-158081-0029 THROWN INTO JAIL BECAUSE THEY DEMAND THEIR POLITICAL FREEDOM THE PRESIDENT EARNESTLY URGED ME NOT TO RESIGN SAYING WHAT WILL THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY THINK WHEN THEY HEAR THAT THE COLLECTOR OF THE PORT OF NEW YORK
2045-158081-0030 HAS RESIGNED BECAUSE OF AN INJUSTICE DONE TO A GROUP OF SUFFRAGISTS BY THE POLICE OFFICIALS OF THE CITY OF WASHINGTON MY REPLY TO THIS WAS WITH ALL RESPECT FOR YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MY EXPLANATION TO THE PUBLIC WILL NOT BE AS DIFFICULT AS YOURS
2045-158081-0031 THAT ARRANGEMENT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR TWO REASONS FIRST THESE WOMEN WOULD NOT WANT ME AS THEIR COUNSEL IF I WERE A MEMBER OF YOUR ADMINISTRATION
2045-158081-0032 AND YOUR ADMINISTRATION IS RESPONSIBLE AND SECONDLY I CANNOT ACCEPT YOUR SUGGESTION BECAUSE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE COURSE OF THE APPEAL VIGOROUSLY TO CRITICIZE AND CONDEMN MEMBERS OF YOUR CABINET AND OTHERS CLOSE TO YOU
2045-158081-0033 AND I COULD NOT ADOPT THIS POLICY WHILE REMAINING IN OFFICE UNDER YOU THE PRESIDENT SEEMED GREATLY UPSET AND FINALLY URGED ME AS A PERSONAL SERVICE TO HIM TO GO AT ONCE AND PERFECT THE CASE ON APPEAL FOR THE SUFFRAGISTS
2045-158081-0034 AND UNTIL HE HAD HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO INVESTIGATE THE FACTS I HAD PRESENTED TO HIM I AGREED TO THIS AND WE CLOSED THE INTERVIEW WITH THE PRESIDENT SAYING IF YOU CONSIDER MY PERSONAL REQUEST AND DO NOT RESIGN
2045-158081-0035 NO STENOGRAPHIC RECORD OF THE TRIAL HAD BEEN TAKEN WHICH PUT ME UNDER THE GREATEST LEGAL DIFFICULTIES I WAS IN THE MIDST OF THESE PREPARATIONS FOR APPEAL THE NEXT DAY WHEN I LEARNED TO MY SURPRISE THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD PARDONED THE WOMEN HE HAD NOT EVEN CONSULTED ME AS THEIR ATTORNEY
2045-158081-0036 MOREOVER I WAS AMAZED THAT SINCE THE PRESIDENT HAD SAID HE CONSIDERED THE TREATMENT OF THE WOMEN SHOCKING HE HAD PARDONED THEM WITHOUT STATING THAT HE DID SO TO CORRECT A GRAVE INJUSTICE I FELT CERTAIN THAT THE HIGH SPIRITED WOMEN IN THE WORKHOUSE WOULD REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE PARDON AS A MERE
2045-158081-0037 BENEVOLENT ACT ON THE PART OF THE PRESIDENT I AT ONCE WENT DOWN TO THE WORKHOUSE IN VIRGINIA MY OPINION WAS CONFIRMED
2045-158081-0038 THE PRESIDENT'S PARDON IS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY HIM OF THE GRAVE INJUSTICE THAT HAS BEEN DONE THIS HE NEVER DENIED UNDER THIS PUBLISHED INTERPRETATION OF HIS PARDON THE WOMEN AT OCCOQUAN ACCEPTED THE PARDON
2045-158081-0039 AND RETURNED TO WASHINGTON THE INCIDENT WAS CLOSED I RETURNED TO NEW YORK DURING THE NEXT TWO MONTHS I CAREFULLY WATCHED THE SITUATION SIX OR EIGHT MORE GROUPS OF WOMEN IN THAT TIME WERE ARRESTED ON THE SAME FALSE CHARGES TRIED AND IMPRISONED IN THE SAME ILLEGAL WAY
2045-158081-0040 FINALLY A GROUP OF WOMEN WAS ARRESTED IN SEPTEMBER UNDER THE IDENTICAL CIRCUMSTANCES AS THOSE IN JULY WAS TRIED IN THE SAME LAWLESS FASHION AND GIVEN THE SAME SENTENCE OF SIXTY DAYS IN THE WORKHOUSE
2045-158081-0041 THE PRESIDENT MAY HAVE BEEN INNOCENT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FIRST ARRESTS BUT HE WAS PERSONALLY AND POLITICALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE ARRESTS THAT OCCURRED AFTER HIS PARDON OF THE FIRST GROUP
2045-158081-0042 MISTER MALONE'S RESIGNATION IN SEPTEMBER NINETEEN SEVENTEEN CAME WITH A SUDDEN SHOCK BECAUSE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND SURELY THE ADMINISTRATION THOUGHT HIM QUIETED AND SUBDUED BY THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL APPEAL TO HIM IN JULY
2045-158081-0043 MISTER MALONE WAS SHOCKED THAT THE POLICY OF ARRESTS SHOULD BE CONTINUED MISTER WILSON AND HIS ADMINISTRATION WERE SHOCKED THAT ANY ONE SHOULD CARE ENOUGH ABOUT THE LIBERTY OF WOMEN TO RESIGN A LUCRATIVE POST IN THE GOVERNMENT THE NATION WAS SHOCKED INTO THE REALIZATION
2045-158081-0044 THAT THIS WAS NOT A STREET BRAWL BETWEEN WOMEN AND POLICEMEN BUT A CONTROVERSY BETWEEN SUFFRAGISTS AND A POWERFUL ADMINISTRATION WE HAD SAID SO
2045-158081-0045 SOLITARY AND GENEROUS ACT GAVE TO THE SPEEDY BREAK DOWN OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S RESISTANCE HIS SACRIFICE LIGHTENED OURS WOMEN OUGHT TO BE WILLING TO MAKE SACRIFICES FOR THEIR OWN LIBERATION
2045-158081-0046 BUT FOR A MAN TO HAVE THE COURAGE AND IMAGINATION TO MAKE SUCH A SACRIFICE FOR THE LIBERATION OF WOMEN IS UNPARALLELED MISTER MALONE CALLED TO THE ATTENTION OF THE NATION THE TRUE CAUSE OF THE OBSTRUCTION AND SUPPRESSION HE REPROACHED THE PRESIDENT AND HIS COLLEAGUES AFTER MATURE CONSIDERATION
2045-158081-0047 IN THE MOST HONORABLE AND VITAL WAY BY REFUSING LONGER TO ASSOCIATE HIMSELF WITH AN ADMINISTRATION WHICH BACKED SUCH POLICIES AND MISTER MALONE'S RESIGNATION WAS NOT ONLY WELCOMED BY THE MILITANT GROUP
2045-158081-0048 THE CONSERVATIVE SUFFRAGE LEADERS ALTHOUGH THEY HEARTILY DISAPPROVED OF PICKETING WERE AS OUTSPOKEN IN THEIR GRATITUDE ALICE STONE BLACKWELL THE DAUGHTER OF LUCY STONE HERSELF A PIONEER SUFFRAGE LEADER AND EDITOR WROTE TO MISTER MALONE
2045-158081-0049 MAY I EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION AND GRATITUDE FOR THE EXCELLENT AND MANLY LETTER THAT YOU HAVE WRITTEN TO PRESIDENT WILSON ON WOMAN SUFFRAGE I AM SURE THAT I AM ONLY ONE OF MANY WOMEN WHO FEEL THANKFUL TO YOU FOR IT THE PICKETING SEEMS TO ME A VERY SILLY BUSINESS
2045-158081-0050 AND I AM SURE IT IS DOING THE CAUSE HARM INSTEAD OF GOOD BUT THE PICKETERS ARE BEING SHAMEFULLY AND ILLEGALLY TREATED AND IT IS A THOUSAND PITIES FOR PRESIDENT WILSON'S OWN SAKE THAT HE EVER ALLOWED THE WASHINGTON AUTHORITIES TO ENTER ON THIS COURSE OF PERSECUTION
2045-158081-0051 IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR SOME ONE TO MAKE A PROTEST AND YOU HAVE MADE ONE THAT HAS BEEN HEARD FAR AND WIDE MISSUS CARRIE CHAPMAN CATT THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL AMERICAN WOMAN SUFFRAGE ASSOCIATION WROTE
2045-158081-0052 EVERY SUFFRAGIST MUST BE GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR THE GALLANT SUPPORT YOU ARE GIVING OUR CAUSE AND THE GREAT SACRIFICE YOU ARE MAKING MISSUS JAMES LEES LAIDLAW VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE NEW YORK SUFFRAGE PARTY SAID
2045-158081-0053 NO WORDS OF MINE CAN TELL YOU HOW OUR HEARTS HAVE BEEN LIFTED AND OUR PURPOSES STRENGTHENED IN THIS TREMENDOUS STRUGGLE IN NEW YORK STATE BY THE READING OF YOUR POWERFUL AND NOBLE UTTERANCES IN YOUR LETTER TO PRESIDENT WILSON THERE FLASHED THROUGH MY MIND
2045-158081-0054 ALL THE MEMORIES OF KNIGHTS OF CHIVALRY AND OF ROMANCE THAT I HAVE EVER READ AND THEY ALL PALED BEFORE YOUR CHAMPIONSHIP AND THE SACRIFICE AND THE HIGH SPIRITED LEADERSHIP THAT IT SIGNIFIES WHERE YOU LEAD I BELIEVE THOUSANDS OF OTHER MEN WILL FOLLOW
2045-158081-0055 EVEN THOUGH AT A DISTANCE AND MOST INADEQUATELY AND FROM THE WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA WITH WHOM MISTER MALONE HAD KEPT FAITH CAME THE MESSAGE THE LIBERTY LOVING WOMEN OF CALIFORNIA GREET YOU AS ONE OF THE FEW MEN IN HISTORY
2045-158081-0056 WHO HAVE BEEN WILLING TO SACRIFICE MATERIAL INTERESTS FOR THE LIBERTY OF A CLASS TO WHICH THEY THEMSELVES DO NOT BELONG WE ARE THRILLED BY YOUR INSPIRING WORDS WE APPRECIATE YOUR SYMPATHETIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE VIEWPOINT OF DISFRANCHISED WOMEN
2045-158081-0057 WE ARE DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR THE INCALCULABLE BENEFIT OF YOUR ACTIVE ASSISTANCE IN THE STRUGGLE OF AMERICAN WOMEN FOR POLITICAL LIBERTY
2045-158081-0058 DEAR MISTER PRESIDENT LAST AUTUMN AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF YOUR ADMINISTRATION I WENT INTO THE WOMAN SUFFRAGE STATES TO URGE YOUR REELECTION THE MOST DIFFICULT ARGUMENT TO MEET AMONG THE SEVEN MILLION VOTERS
2045-158081-0059 WAS THE FAILURE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THROUGHOUT FOUR YEARS OF POWER TO PASS THE FEDERAL SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT LOOKING TOWARD THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF ALL THE WOMEN OF THE COUNTRY THROUGHOUT THOSE STATES AND PARTICULARLY IN CALIFORNIA
2045-158081-0060 WHICH ULTIMATELY DECIDED THE ELECTION BY THE VOTES OF WOMEN THE WOMEN VOTERS WERE URGED TO SUPPORT YOU EVEN THOUGH JUDGE HUGHES HAD ALREADY DECLARED FOR THE FEDERAL SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT BECAUSE YOU AND YOUR PARTY THROUGH LIBERAL LEADERSHIP
2045-158081-0061 WERE MORE LIKELY NATIONALLY TO ENFRANCHISE THE REST OF THE WOMEN OF THE COUNTRY THAN WERE YOUR OPPONENTS AND IF THE WOMEN OF THE WEST VOTED TO REELECT YOU I PROMISED THEM THAT I WOULD SPEND ALL MY ENERGY AT ANY SACRIFICE TO MYSELF
2045-158081-0062 TO GET THE PRESENT DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION TO PASS THE FEDERAL SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT BUT THE PRESENT POLICY OF THE ADMINISTRATION IN PERMITTING SPLENDID AMERICAN WOMEN TO BE SENT TO JAIL IN WASHINGTON NOT FOR CARRYING OFFENSIVE BANNERS NOT FOR PICKETING
2045-158081-0063 BUT ON THE TECHNICAL CHARGE OF OBSTRUCTING TRAFFIC IS A DENIAL EVEN OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PETITION FOR AND DEMAND THE PASSAGE OF THE FEDERAL SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT IT THEREFORE NOW BECOMES MY PROFOUND OBLIGATION ACTIVELY TO KEEP MY PROMISE TO THE WOMEN OF THE WEST
2045-158081-0064 IN MORE THAN TWENTY STATES IT IS A PRACTICAL IMPOSSIBILITY TO AMEND THE STATE CONSTITUTIONS SO THE WOMEN OF THOSE STATES CAN ONLY BE ENFRANCHISED BY THE PASSAGE OF THE FEDERAL SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT SINCE ENGLAND AND RUSSIA IN THE MIDST OF THE GREAT WAR
2045-158081-0065 SHOULD WE NOT BE JEALOUS TO MAINTAIN OUR DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD BY THE SPEEDY NATIONAL ENFRANCHISEMENT OF AMERICAN WOMEN TO ME MISTER PRESIDENT
2045-158081-0066 IN WASHINGTON TWO MONTHS AGO THIS IS NOT ONLY A MEASURE OF JUSTICE AND DEMOCRACY
2045-158081-0067 EDUCATED IN OUR SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES AND MILLIONS OF AMERICAN WOMEN IN OUR HOMES OR TOILING FOR ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE IN EVERY LINE OF INDUSTRY TO GIVE UP BY CONSCRIPTION THEIR MEN AND HAPPINESS TO A WAR FOR DEMOCRACY IN EUROPE
2045-158081-0068 WHILE THESE WOMEN CITIZENS ARE DENIED THE RIGHT TO VOTE ON THE POLICIES OF THE GOVERNMENT WHICH DEMANDS OF THEM SUCH SACRIFICE FOR THIS REASON MANY OF YOUR MOST ARDENT FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS FEEL THAT THE PASSAGE OF THE FEDERAL SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT
2045-158081-0069 IS A WAR MEASURE WHICH COULD APPROPRIATELY BE URGED BY YOU AT THIS SESSION OF CONGRESS IT IS TRUE THAT THIS AMENDMENT WOULD HAVE TO COME FROM CONGRESS BUT THE PRESENT CONGRESS SHOWS NO EARNEST DESIRE TO ENACT THIS LEGISLATION FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT YOU
2045-158081-0070 AS THE LEADER OF THE PARTY IN POWER HAVE NOT YET SUGGESTED IT FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY GLADLY ACKNOWLEDGES MISTER PRESIDENT THAT NO VITAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION HAS COME THROUGH CONGRESS THESE FIVE YEARS EXCEPT BY YOUR EXTRAORDINARY AND BRILLIANT LEADERSHIP
2045-158081-0071 AND WHAT MILLIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN TO DAY HOPE IS THAT YOU WILL GIVE THE FEDERAL SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT TO THE WOMEN OF THE COUNTRY BY THE VALOR OF YOUR LEADERSHIP NOW IT WILL HEARTEN THE MOTHERS OF THE NATION ELIMINATE A JUST GRIEVANCE
2045-158081-0072 AND TURN THE DEVOTED ENERGIES OF BRILLIANT WOMEN TO A MORE HEARTY SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THIS CRISIS AS YOU WELL KNOW IN DOZENS OF SPEECHES IN MANY STATES I HAVE ADVOCATED YOUR POLICIES AND THE WAR
2045-158081-0073 I WAS THE FIRST MAN OF YOUR ADMINISTRATION NEARLY FIVE YEARS AGO TO PUBLICLY ADVOCATE PREPAREDNESS AND HELPED TO FOUND THE FIRST PLATTSBURG TRAINING CAMP AND IF WITH OUR TROOPS MOBILIZING IN FRANCE YOU WILL GIVE AMERICAN WOMEN THIS MEASURE FOR THEIR POLITICAL FREEDOM
2045-158081-0074 THEY WILL SUPPORT WITH GREATER ENTHUSIASM YOUR HOPE AND THE HOPE OF AMERICA FOR WORLD FREEDOM I HAVE NOT APPROVED ALL THE METHODS RECENTLY ADOPTED BY WOMEN IN PURSUIT OF THEIR POLITICAL LIBERTY YET MISTER PRESIDENT
2045-158081-0075 HORACE GREELEY AND WENDELL PHILLIPS ASSURED THE SUFFRAGE LEADERS THAT IF THEY ABANDONED THEIR FIGHT FOR SUFFRAGE WHEN THE WAR WAS ENDED THE MEN OF THE NATION OUT OF GRATITUDE WOULD ENFRANCHISE THE WOMEN OF THE COUNTRY
2045-158081-0076 AND IF THE MEN OF THIS COUNTRY HAD BEEN PEACEFULLY DEMANDING FOR OVER HALF A CENTURY THE POLITICAL RIGHT OR PRIVILEGE TO VOTE AND HAD BEEN CONTINUOUSLY IGNORED OR MET WITH EVASION BY SUCCESSIVE CONGRESSES AS HAVE THE WOMEN
2045-158081-0077 YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AS A LOVER OF LIBERTY WOULD BE THE FIRST TO COMPREHEND AND FORGIVE THEIR INEVITABLE IMPATIENCE AND RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION WILL NOT THIS ADMINISTRATION REELECTED TO POWER BY THE HOPE AND FAITH OF THE WOMEN OF THE WEST
2045-158081-0078 HANDSOMELY REWARD THAT FAITH BY TAKING ACTION NOW FOR THE PASSAGE OF THE FEDERAL SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT IN THE PORT OF NEW YORK DURING THE LAST FOUR YEARS
2045-158081-0079 BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE EXPORT AND IMPORT TRADE OF THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN HANDLED BY THE MEN OF THE CUSTOMS SERVICE THEIR TREATMENT OF THE TRAVELING PUBLIC HAS RADICALLY CHANGED THEIR VIGILANCE SUPPLIED THE EVIDENCE OF THE LUSITANIA NOTE THE NEUTRALITY WAS RIGIDLY MAINTAINED
2045-158081-0080 THE GREAT GERMAN FLEET GUARDED CAPTURED AND REPAIRED SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIES AND REFORMS HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED AND MY ARDENT INDUSTRY HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THIS GREAT OFFICE OF YOUR APPOINTMENT BUT NOW I WISH TO LEAVE THESE FINISHED TASKS
2045-158081-0081 TO FIGHT AS HARD FOR THE POLITICAL FREEDOM OF WOMEN AS I HAVE ALWAYS FOUGHT FOR YOUR LIBERAL LEADERSHIP IT SEEMS A LONG SEVEN YEARS MISTER PRESIDENT SINCE I FIRST CAMPAIGNED WITH YOU WHEN YOU WERE RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY
2045-158081-0082 IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE THROUGHOUT THOSE YEARS I HAVE SERVED YOU WITH THE MOST RESPECTFUL AFFECTION AND UNSHADOWED DEVOTION IT IS NO SMALL SACRIFICE NOW FOR ME AS A MEMBER OF YOUR ADMINISTRATION TO SEVER OUR POLITICAL RELATIONSHIP
2045-158081-0083 BUT I THINK IT IS HIGH TIME THAT MEN IN THIS GENERATION AT SOME COST TO THEMSELVES STOOD UP TO BATTLE FOR THE NATIONAL ENFRANCHISEMENT OF AMERICAN WOMEN
2045-158081-0084 AND MORE FREELY TO GO INTO THIS LARGER FIELD OF DEMOCRATIC EFFORT I HEREBY RESIGN MY OFFICE AS COLLECTOR OF THE PORT OF NEW YORK TO TAKE EFFECT AT ONCE OR AT YOUR EARLIEST CONVENIENCE YOURS RESPECTFULLY
2045-158081-0085 SIGNED DUDLEY FIELD MALONE THE PRESIDENT'S ANSWER HAS NEVER BEFORE BEEN PUBLISHED U S S MAYFLOWER
2045-158081-0086 THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON MY DEAR MISTER COLLECTOR YOUR LETTER OF SEPTEMBER SEVENTH REACHED ME JUST BEFORE I LEFT HOME AND I HAVE I AM SORRY TO SAY
2045-158081-0087 I MUST FRANKLY SAY THAT I CANNOT REGARD YOUR REASONS FOR RESIGNING YOUR POSITION AS COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS AS CONVINCING BUT IT IS SO EVIDENTLY YOUR WISH TO BE RELIEVED FROM THE DUTIES OF THE OFFICE THAT I DO NOT FEEL AT LIBERTY TO WITHHOLD MY ACCEPTANCE OF YOUR RESIGNATION
2045-158081-0088 INDEED I JUDGE FROM YOUR LETTER THAT ANY DISCUSSION OF THE REASONS WOULD NOT BE ACCEPTABLE TO YOU AND THAT IT IS YOUR DESIRE TO BE FREE OF THE RESTRAINTS OF PUBLIC OFFICE I THEREFORE ACCEPT YOUR RESIGNATION TO TAKE EFFECT AS YOU HAVE WISHED
2045-158081-0089 I NEED NOT SAY THAT OUR LONG ASSOCIATION IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS MAKES ME REGRET THE ACTION YOU HAVE TAKEN MOST SINCERELY VERY TRULY YOURS SIGNED WOODROW WILSON
2045-158081-0090 COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS NEW YORK CITY TO THIS MISTER MALONE REPLIED NEW YORK
2045-158081-0091 NINETEEN SEVENTEEN THE PRESIDENT THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON D C DEAR MISTER PRESIDENT THANK YOU SINCERELY FOR YOUR COURTESY
2045-158081-0092 I AM UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULD JUDGE THAT ANY DISCUSSION BY YOU OF MY REASONS FOR RESIGNING WOULD NOT BE ACCEPTABLE TO ME SINCE MY LETTER WAS AN APPEAL TO YOU ON SPECIFIC GROUNDS FOR ACTION NOW BY THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE FEDERAL SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT
2045-158081-0093 HOWEVER I AM PROFOUNDLY GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR YOUR PROMPT ACCEPTANCE OF MY RESIGNATION YOURS RESPECTFULLY SIGNED
2045-158081-0094 IT YIELDED ON A POINT OF MACHINERY
2045-158081-0095 THE PRESS HAD TURNED AGAIN TO MORE SYMPATHETIC ACCOUNTS OF OUR CAMPAIGN AND EXPOSED THE PRISON REGIME WE WERE UNDERGOING WE WERE NOW FOR A MOMENT THE OBJECT OF SYMPATHY THE ADMINISTRATION WAS THE BUTT OF CONSIDERABLE HOSTILITY SENSING THEIR PREDICAMENT AND FEARING ANY LOSS OF PRESTIGE
2045-158081-0096 THEY RISKED A SLIGHT ADVANCE SENATOR JONES CHAIRMAN OF THE SUFFRAGE COMMITTEE MADE A VISIT TO THE WORKHOUSE SCARCELY HAD THE WOMEN RECOVERED FROM THE SURPRISE OF HIS VISIT WHEN THE SENATOR ON THE FOLLOWING DAY SEPTEMBER FIFTEENTH
2045-158081-0097 FILED THE FAVORABLE REPORT WHICH HAD BEEN LYING WITH HIS COMMITTEE SINCE MAY FIFTEENTH EXACTLY SIX MONTHS THE REPORT WHICH HE HAD SO LONG DELAYED BECAUSE HE WANTED HE SAID TO MAKE IT A PARTICULARLY BRILLIANT AND ELABORATE ONE
2045-158081-0098 CHAIRMAN OF THE RULES COMMITTEE AND ADMINISTRATION LEADER HIMSELF AN ANTI SUFFRAGIST
2045-158081-0099 HAD HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEIR ACTION REVEALED NAIVELY HOW SURELY IT HAD OF THE TWO HUNDRED NINETY ONE MEN PRESENT NOT ONE MAN STOOD SQUARELY UP FOR THE RIGHT OF THE HUNDREDS OF WOMEN WHO PETITIONED FOR JUSTICE SOME INDIRECTLY AND MANY INADVERTENTLY HOWEVER
2045-158081-0100 PAID ELOQUENT TRIBUTE TO THE SUFFRAGE PICKET
2045-158081-0101 AND THE PRESIDENT'S SANCTION OF THE COMMITTEE THE ACCUSATIONS AND COUNTER ACCUSATIONS CONCERNING THE WISDOM OF APPOINTING IT IN THE FACE OF THE PICKETS WERE MANY AND ANIMATED MISTER MEEKER OF MISSOURI DEMOCRAT PROTESTED AGAINST CONGRESS
2045-158081-0102 YIELDING TO THE NAGGING OF A CERTAIN GROUP MISTER CANTRILL OF KENTUCKY DEMOCRAT BELIEVED THAT MILLIONS OF CHRISTIAN WOMEN IN THE NATION SHOULD NOT BE DENIED THE RIGHT OF HAVING A COMMITTEE IN THE HOUSE TO STUDY THE PROBLEM OF SUFFRAGE
2045-158081-0103 BECAUSE OF THE MISTAKES OF SOME FEW OF THEIR SISTERS ONE HAD AS WELL SAY HE WENT ON THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO POLICE IN WASHINGTON BECAUSE THE POLICE FORCE OF THIS CITY PERMITTED DAILY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO OBSTRUCT THE STREETS
2045-158081-0104 DEPLORED TAKING ANY ACTION WHICH WOULD SEEM TO YIELD TO THE DEMAND OF THE PICKETS WHO CARRIED BANNERS WHICH IF USED BY A POOR WORKINGMAN IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET HIS RIGHTS WOULD SPEEDILY HAVE PUT HIM BEHIND THE BARS FOR TREASON OR SEDITION AND THESE POOR BEWILDERED DELUDED CREATURES
2045-158081-0105 AFTER THEIR DISGUSTING EXHIBITION CAN THANK THEIR STARS THAT BECAUSE THEY WEAR SKIRTS THEY ARE NOW INCARCERATED FOR MISDEMEANORS OF A MINOR CHARACTER TO SUPINELY YIELD TO A CERTAIN CLASS OF WOMEN PICKETING THE GATES OF THE OFFICIAL RESIDENCE YES EVEN POSING WITH THEIR SHORT SKIRTS AND THEIR SHORT HAIR
2045-158081-0106 AND OUR OFFICE BUILDINGS WITH BANNERS WHICH WOULD SEEK TO LEAD THE PEOPLE TO BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE WE DID NOT TAKE ACTION DURING THIS WAR SESSION UPON SUFFRAGE IF YOU PLEASE AND GRANT THEM THE RIGHT OF THE BALLOT THAT WE WERE TRAITORS TO THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC WOULD BE MONSTROUS
2045-158081-0107 THE SUBJECT OF THE CREATION OF A COMMITTEE ON SUFFRAGE WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN THE CONGRESSMEN WERE UTTERLY UNABLE TO SHAKE OFF THE GHOSTS OF THE PICKETS THE PICKETS HAD NOT INFLUENCED THEIR ACTIONS
2045-158081-0108 THE VERY IDEA WAS APPALLING TO REPRESENTATIVE STAFFORD OF WISCONSIN ANTI SUFFRAGE REPUBLICAN WHO JOINED IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROTESTS
2045-158081-0109 THERE IS ONLY ONE QUESTION BEFORE THE HOUSE TODAY AND THAT IS IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM A POLITICAL ASPECT WHETHER YOU WISH TO APPROVE OF THE PRACTICES OF THESE WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN DISGRACING THEIR CAUSE HERE IN WASHINGTON FOR THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS REPRESENTATIVE VOLSTEAD OF MINNESOTA REPUBLICAN
2045-158081-0110 CAME THE CLOSEST OF ALL TO REAL COURAGE IN HIS PROTEST IN THIS DISCUSSION SOME VERY UNFAIR COMMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE UPON THE WOMEN WHO PICKETED THE WHITE HOUSE WHILE I DO NOT APPROVE OF PICKETING I DISAPPROVE MORE STRONGLY OF THE HOODLUM METHODS PURSUED IN SUPPRESSING THE PRACTICE
2045-158081-0111 I GATHER FROM THE PRESS THAT THIS IS WHAT TOOK PLACE SOME WOMEN DID IN A PEACEABLE AND PERFECTLY LAWFUL MANNER DISPLAY SUFFRAGE BANNERS ON THE PUBLIC STREET NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE TO STOP THIS THE POLICE ALLOWED THE WOMEN TO BE MOBBED AND THEN BECAUSE THE MOB OBSTRUCTED THE STREET
2045-158081-0112 THE WOMEN WERE ARRESTED AND FINED WHILE THE MOB WENT SCOT FREE THE SUFFRAGE COMMITTEE IN THE HOUSE WAS APPOINTED THE CREATION OF THIS COMMITTEE WHICH HAD BEEN PENDING SINCE NINETEEN THIRTEEN WAS NOW FINALLY GRANTED IN SEPTEMBER NINETEEN SEVENTEEN TO BE SURE
2045-158081-0113 THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED ONLY AFTER AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF TIME MONEY AND EFFORT HAD BEEN SPENT ON A SUSTAINED AND RELENTLESS CAMPAIGN OF PRESSURE BUT THE ADMINISTRATION HAD YIELDED AS A MEANS TO REMOVE THE PICKETS HOWEVER THIS YIELDING HAD FAILED
