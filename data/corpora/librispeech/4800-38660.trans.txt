4800-38660-0000 A TUMBLER OF THE OLD MARCOBRUNNER DAVID AND A SLICE OF THE GAME PIE BEFORE I SAY ONE WORD ABOUT WHAT WE OWE TO THAT ANGEL UPSTAIRS OFF WITH THE WINE MY DEAR BOY YOU LOOK AS PALE AS DEATH
4800-38660-0001 WITH THOSE WORDS MISTER ENGELMAN LIT HIS PIPE AND WAITED IN SILENCE UNTIL THE GOOD EATING AND DRINKING HAD DONE THEIR GOOD WORK NOW CARRY YOUR MIND BACK TO LAST NIGHT HE BEGAN
4800-38660-0002 BUT POOR KELLER'S ILLNESS MADE THAT IMPOSSIBLE
4800-38660-0003 TO ASK PARTICULARLY IN WHAT FORM THE ILLNESS DECLARED ITSELF
4800-38660-0004 DO THE DOCTORS UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH HIM SHE ASKED I TOLD HER THAT ONE OF THE DOCTORS WAS EVIDENTLY PUZZLED AND THAT THE OTHER HAD ACKNOWLEDGED
4800-38660-0005 I NATURALLY ASKED WHAT SHE MEANT I WISH I COULD GIVE HER EXPLANATION DAVID IN HER OWN DELIGHTFUL WORDS
4800-38660-0006 IT CAME IN SUBSTANCE TO THIS SOME PERSON IN HER HUSBAND'S EMPLOYMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WURZBURG HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY A MALADY PRESENTING EXACTLY THE SAME SYMPTOMS
4800-38660-0007 FROM WHICH MISTER KELLER WAS SUFFERING THE MEDICAL MEN HAD BEEN JUST AS MUCH AT A LOSS WHAT TO DO AS OUR MEDICAL MEN ALONE AMONG THEM DOCTOR FONTAINE UNDERSTOOD THE CASE
4800-38660-0008 OF COURSE YOU ASKED HER FOR THE PRESCRIPTION I SAID I BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND IT NOW NO DAVID YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IT YET I CERTAINLY ASKED HER FOR THE PRESCRIPTION
4800-38660-0009 NO SUCH THING WAS KNOWN TO BE IN EXISTENCE SHE REMINDED ME THAT HER HUSBAND HAD MADE UP THE MEDICINE HIMSELF BUT SHE REMEMBERED THAT THE RESULTS HAD EXCEEDED HIS ANTICIPATIONS
4800-38660-0010 AND THAT ONLY A PART OF THE REMEDY HAD BEEN USED THE BOTTLE MIGHT STILL PERHAPS BE FOUND AT WURZBURG
4800-38660-0011 THERE IS A CHRISTIAN WOMAN DAVID IF EVER THERE WAS ONE YET AFTER THE MANNER IN WHICH POOR KELLER HAD TREATED HER SHE WAS AS EAGER TO HELP HIM AS IF HE HAD BEEN HER DEAREST FRIEND
4800-38660-0012 WHY SHOULD YOU DISTRESS YOURSELF MAMMA SHE SAID TELL ME WHAT THE BOTTLE IS LIKE AND LET ME TRY IF I CAN FIND IT NO IT WAS QUITE ENOUGH FOR MADAME FONTAINE
4800-38660-0013 THAT THERE WAS AN ACT OF MERCY TO BE DONE AT ANY SACRIFICE OF HER OWN FEELINGS SHE WAS PREPARED TO DO IT I INTERRUPTED HIM AGAIN EAGER TO HEAR THE END
4800-38660-0014 AND SHE FOUND THE BOTTLE I SAID SHE FOUND THE BOTTLE MISTER ENGELMAN RESUMED I CAN SHOW IT TO YOU IF YOU LIKE SHE HAS HERSELF REQUESTED ME TO KEEP IT UNDER LOCK AND KEY
4800-38660-0015 SO LONG AS IT IS WANTED IN THIS HOUSE HE OPENED AN OLD CABINET
4800-38660-0016 AND TOOK OUT A LONG NARROW BOTTLE OF DARK BLUE GLASS IN FORM IT WAS QUAINTLY AND REMARKABLY UNLIKE ANY MODERN BOTTLE THAT I HAD EVER SEEN THE GLASS STOPPER WAS CAREFULLY SECURED BY A PIECE OF LEATHER
4800-38660-0017 BUT EXAMINING THE SURFACE OF THE GLASS CAREFULLY I FOUND CERTAIN FAINTLY MARKED STAINS WHICH SUGGESTED THAT THE LABEL MIGHT HAVE BEEN REMOVED AND THAT SOME TRACES OF THE PASTE OR GUM BY WHICH IT HAD BEEN SECURED
4800-38660-0018 HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETELY WASHED AWAY I HELD THE BOTTLE UP TO THE LIGHT AND FOUND THAT IT WAS STILL NEARLY HALF FULL MISTER ENGELMAN FORBADE ME TO REMOVE THE STOPPER IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT HE SAID
4800-38660-0019 THAT NO AIR SHOULD BE ADMITTED TO THE BOTTLE EXCEPT WHEN THERE WAS AN ACTUAL NECESSITY FOR ADMINISTERING THE REMEDY I TOOK IT AWAY WITH ME THE SAME NIGHT HE WENT ON
4800-38660-0020 AND A WRETCHED STATE OF MIND I WAS IN BETWEEN MY ANXIETY TO GIVE THE MEDICINE TO POOR DEAR KELLER IMMEDIATELY AND MY FEAR OF TAKING SUCH A SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITY ENTIRELY ON MYSELF
4800-38660-0021 MADAME FONTAINE ALWAYS JUST IN HER VIEWS SAID YOU HAD BETTER WAIT AND CONSULT THE DOCTORS SHE MADE BUT ONE CONDITION THE GENEROUS CREATURE RELATING TO HERSELF
4800-38660-0022 IF THE REMEDY IS TRIED SHE SAID I MUST ASK YOU TO GIVE IT A FAIR CHANCE BY PERMITTING ME TO ACT AS NURSE THE TREATMENT OF THE PATIENT WHEN HE BEGINS TO FEEL THE BENEFIT OF THE MEDICINE
4800-38660-0023 IS OF SERIOUS IMPORTANCE I KNOW THIS FROM MY HUSBAND'S INSTRUCTIONS AND IT IS DUE TO HIS MEMORY TO SAY NOTHING OF WHAT IS DUE TO MISTER KELLER THAT I SHOULD BE AT THE BEDSIDE
4800-38660-0024 THAT I JOYFULLY ACCEPTED THE OFFERED HELP SO THE NIGHT PASSED THE NEXT MORNING SOON AFTER YOU FELL ASLEEP THE DOCTORS CAME YOU MAY IMAGINE WHAT THEY THOUGHT OF POOR KELLER
4800-38660-0025 I COULD NOT FEEL ABSOLUTELY SURE OF THE NEW MEDICINE AND WITH TIME OF SUCH TERRIBLE IMPORTANCE AND LONDON SO FAR OFF I WAS REALLY AFRAID TO MISS A POST
4800-38660-0026 I WAS FAR FROM BLAMING HIM AND I SAID SO IN HIS PLACE I SHOULD HAVE DONE WHAT HE DID WE ARRANGED THAT I SHOULD WRITE TO FRITZ BY THAT NIGHT'S MAIL
4800-38660-0027 ON THE CHANCE THAT MY ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE BETTER NEWS MIGHT REACH HIM BEFORE HE LEFT LONDON MY LETTER DESPATCHED MISTER ENGELMAN CONTINUED I BEGGED BOTH THE DOCTORS TO SPEAK WITH ME BEFORE THEY WENT AWAY IN MY PRIVATE ROOM
4800-38660-0028 THERE I TOLD THEM IN THE PLAINEST WORDS I COULD FIND EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU DOCTOR DORMANN BEHAVED LIKE A GENTLEMAN HE SAID LET ME SEE THE LADY
4800-38660-0029 AND SPEAK TO HER MYSELF BEFORE THE NEW REMEDY IS TRIED AS FOR THE OTHER WHAT DO YOU THINK HE DID WALKED OUT OF THE HOUSE THE OLD BRUTE
4800-38660-0030 AND DECLINED ANY FURTHER ATTENDANCE ON THE PATIENT AND WHO DO YOU THINK FOLLOWED HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE DAVID
4800-38660-0031 AND THAT STRANGER A HANDSOME LADY WAS AN AGGRAVATION OF THE WRONG WHICH MOTHER BARBARA HAD CONTEMPLATED WHEN SHE THREATENED US WITH THE ALTERNATIVE OF LEAVING THE HOUSE WELL MISTER ENGELMAN RESUMED
4800-38660-0032 THE MEDICINE KEPT ITS OWN SECRET ALL THE INGREDIENTS BUT TWO SET ANALYSIS AT DEFIANCE IN THE MEANTIME WE GAVE THE FIRST DOSE
4800-38660-0033 BUT FOR YOU WE MIGHT NEVER HAVE KNOWN MADAME FONTAINE THE DOOR OPENED AS HE SPOKE AND I FOUND MYSELF CONFRONTED BY A SECOND SURPRISE MINNA CAME IN WEARING A COOK'S APRON
4800-38660-0034 AND ASKED IF HER MOTHER HAD RUNG FOR HER YET UNDER THE WIDOW'S INSTRUCTIONS SHE WAS PREPARING THE PECULIAR VEGETABLE DIET WHICH HAD BEEN PRESCRIBED BY DOCTOR FONTAINE AS PART OF THE CURE
4800-38660-0035 ACTUALLY ESTABLISHED AS INMATES UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH MISTER KELLER WHAT WOULD FRITZ THINK WHEN HE KNEW OF IT WHAT WOULD MISTER KELLER SAY WHEN HE RECOGNIZED HIS NURSE AND WHEN HE HEARD THAT SHE HAD SAVED HIS LIFE
