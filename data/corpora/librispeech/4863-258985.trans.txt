4863-258985-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY THREE MONOPOLY PROFITS
4863-258985-0001 ONE THE TERM MONOPOLY IS USED LOOSELY AND IN MANY SENSES IN POPULAR DISCUSSION MONOPOLY MEANS ALMOST ANY WEALTHY CORPORATION OR THE POWER THE CORPORATION POSSESSES A POWER WHICH IS USUALLY THOUGHT OF AS OPPRESSIVE
4863-258985-0002 EVEN ECONOMISTS HAVE HELD THE VAGUEST IDEAS REGARDING MONOPOLY THE RECENT RISE OF TRUSTS AND MONOPOLIES HAS GIVEN A LARGE NEW BODY OF FACTS BEARING UPON THE SUBJECT
4863-258985-0003 BUT ALL THE RESULTING DISCUSSION BY THE PUBLIC AND BY ECONOMISTS HAS NOT BROUGHT AGREEMENT UPON A DEFINITION ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY WHEN USAGE HAS NOT SETTLED UPON ANY ONE MEANING THE SELECTION OF A DEFINITION IS IN A MEASURE ARBITRARY
4863-258985-0004 TWO MONOPOLY SHOULD NOT BE USED AS SYNONYMOUS WITH SCARCITY
4863-258985-0005 THE SIMPLEST THINGS BRICKS SAND THE COMMONEST UNSKILLED LABOR WOULD HAVE NO VALUE WERE THERE NOT A DEGREE OF SCARCITY RELATIVE TO THE WANTS THAT MAY BE GRATIFIED MONOPOLY WHATEVER ELSE IT MEANS
4863-258985-0006 ALWAYS CONVEYS THE IDEA OF SOME EXCEPTIONAL KIND OF SCARCITY SCARCITY DUE IN PART TO SOME SOURCE OR CAUSE NOT ORDINARILY PRESENT IT IS A BAD PRACTICE IN DEFINITION TO APPLY TWO WORDS TO ONE IDEA LEAVING THE OTHER IDEA UNNAMED
4863-258985-0007 AS IS DONE WHEN MONOPOLY IS MADE SYNONYMOUS WITH SCARCITY BOTH WORDS ARE NEEDED SUCH A USAGE UNFORTUNATELY IS COMMON IN ECONOMIC LITERATURE MANY ECONOMIC WRITERS FOR EXAMPLE HAVE CALLED LANDOWNERSHIP MONOPOLY
4863-258985-0008 SAYING THAT LAND BEING THE WORK OF NATURE CANNOT BE INCREASED BY MEN AND THEREFORE MUST ALWAYS BE SCARCE
4863-258985-0009 LAND COULD BE PRODUCED BY MAN THERE STILL WOULD BE CONFUSION HERE BETWEEN A GENERAL CLASS OF GOODS AND A SPECIAL THING THE FACT THAT A PARTICULAR FIELD CANNOT BE DUPLICATED DOES NOT MAKE A MONOPOLY OF LAND AS A WHOLE
4863-258985-0010 MAKES LAND VALUELESS OR A FREE GOOD NOR IS A LAND OWNER A MONOPOLIST ANY MORE THAN IS THE OWNER OF A VALUABLE MACHINE THE OWNER OF FORTY ACRES OF LAND WORTH FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS OR THE OWNER OF A VILLAGE LOT WORTH A HUNDRED DOLLARS
4863-258985-0011 CAN HARDLY BE CALLED A MONOPOLIST IT LEADS TO ABSURDITY TO USE THE WORD MONOPOLY WITH REFERENCE TO LANDOWNERSHIP INDISCRIMINATELY NEITHER MERE SCARCITY NOR THE LIMITATION OF NATURAL STORES SHOULD BE CALLED MONOPOLY
4863-258985-0012 THREE THE ABILITY OF SUPERIOR MATERIAL AGENTS AND OF SKILLED WORKERS TO SECURE HIGHER RETURNS THAN DO POOR ONES DOES NOT CONSTITUTE MONOPOLY THE FREE COMPETITION ASSUMED IN ABSTRACT DISCUSSIONS OF VALUE
4863-258985-0013 DOES NOT MEAN EQUAL CAPACITY OR EFFICIENCY BUT THE LEGAL FREEDOM AND PERSONAL WILLINGNESS TO MOVE A PRODUCTIVE AGENT INTO THE HIGHEST INDUSTRIAL PLACE IT IS CAPABLE OF HOLDING THE ROCKY FIELD DOES NOT COMPETE WITH THE FERTILE ONE
4863-258985-0014 IN THE SENSE THAT IT CAN YIELD THE SAME USES THE FIELD FIT ONLY FOR POTATOES DOES NOT COMPETE WITH THOSE RARE AND FAVORED LOCALITIES THAT CAN RAISE THE BEST WINES THE GARDENER EARNING TWO DOLLARS A DAY DOES NOT COMPETE WITH THE SKILLED PHYSICIAN
4863-258985-0015 WITH AN INCOME OF TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR HE HAS NOT THE ECONOMIC CAPACITY TO DO SO BUT HE IS FREE TO COMPETE
4863-258985-0016 UNLESS LAW CASTE CLASS LEGISLATION SOCIAL PREJUDICE OR SOME OTHER OBJECTIVE FACTOR FORBIDS ANYTHING HOWEVER THAT PREVENTS THE LABOR OR CAPITAL OF BUYERS OR SELLERS FROM APPLICATION FOR WHICH THEY ARE FITTED
4863-258985-0017 DEFEATS FREE COMPETITION TO USE THE TERM MONOPOLY OF ANY AND EVERY LIMITATION OF ECONOMIC ABILITY IS TO EXTEND IT TO EVERY CASE OF VALUE TO USE IT OF THE HIGH WAGES OF SKILLED WORKMEN
4863-258985-0018 WHERE NO UNION TO SUPPRESS COMPETITION EXISTS AMONG THEM IS TO MAKE IT A COLORLESS SYNONYM OF SCARCITY IT SHOULD BE CONFINED TO A NARROWER AND MORE EXCLUSIVE USE SOME SPECIAL KINDS OF LIMITATION
4863-258985-0019 IN UNIFIED CONTROL FOUR THE LIMITATION CONNECTED WITH MONOPOLY IS NOT THAT OF ECONOMIC CAPACITY BUT THAT OF OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL THE DERIVATION OF THE WORD FROM THE GREEK POINTS TO THE GENERAL THOUGHT MONOS
4863-258985-0020 SUCH AS SOAP CANDLES ET CETERA
4863-258985-0021 THIS POLICY IS PURSUED IN A LIMITED DEGREE TO DAY FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF INVENTION IN THE GRANTING OF PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS IN THE CURRENT DEFINITION THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT POWER
4863-258985-0022 OR PRIVILEGE OF DEALING IN SOME ARTICLE OR TRADING IN SOME MARKET THE TERM DEALING IN IS WELL CHOSEN
4863-258985-0023 AND INCLUDES POWER DERIVED FROM POLITICAL AS WELL AS FROM OTHER SOURCES BUT THE TERM EXCLUSIVE IS TOO ABSOLUTE ALLOWS OF NO GRADATIONS AND MAKES THE DEFINITION APPLICABLE
4863-258985-0024 AND SOME PORTION OF THE SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS BUT ORDINARILY THE PORTION CONTROLLED BY ANY ONE IS SO SMALL THAT WITHHOLDING IT ENTIRELY FROM SALE WOULD NOT CAUSE THE MARKET PRICE TO RISE IN ANY APPRECIABLE DEGREE THE PRODUCER IN SUCH A CASE
4863-258985-0025 REGULATES HIS ACTION AS IF THE MARKET PRICE WERE FIXED BEYOND HIS CONTROL AND HE USES HIS PRODUCTIVE AGENTS FULLY UP TO THE POINT WHERE COSTS EQUAL PRICE ON THE MARGINAL UNIT OF PRODUCT A SKILLED WORKER GETTING FIVE DOLLARS A DAY
4863-258985-0026 AS A REDUCTION OF SUPPLY RESULTS IN A HIGHER PRICE IT IS POSSIBLE AS IS SEEN IN THE PARADOX OF VALUE
4863-258985-0027 YIELD A LARGER SUM IN THE MARKET THAN A LARGER NUMBER OF UNITS BUT THE SELLER'S INTEREST LIES NOT IN THE INCREASE OF TOTAL SALES BUT IN THAT OF NET GAINS NET GAINS BEING THE PRODUCT OF THE NUMBER OF UNITS SOLD
4863-258985-0028 INCREASE AT A MUCH FASTER RATE THAN DO TOTAL SALES THE EXISTENCE OF MONOPOLY POWER IN ANY DEGREE DEPENDS THEREFORE ON SEVERAL FACTORS THE EFFECT OF CONTRACTION OF SUPPLY IN RAISING PRICES THE EFFECT ON COSTS
4863-258985-0029 THE NUMBER OF UNITS REMAINING IN THE OWNERSHIP OF THE ONE CONTRACTING SUPPLY AND THE POSSIBILITY OF PREVENTING OTHERS FROM INCREASING SUPPLY LATER TO PROFIT BY THE HIGHER PRICES
4863-258985-0030 ONE MONOPOLY GETS ITS POWER FROM POLITICAL ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL SOURCES A POLITICAL MONOPOLY DERIVES ITS POWER OF CONTROL FROM A SPECIAL GRANT FROM THE GOVERNMENT FORBIDDING OTHERS TO ENGAGE IN THAT BUSINESS
4863-258985-0031 THE TYPICAL POLITICAL MONOPOLY IS THAT CONFERRED BY A CROWN PATENT BESTOWING THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO CARRY ON A CERTAIN BUSINESS A SECOND KIND IS THAT CONFERRED BY A PATENT FOR INVENTION OR THE COPYRIGHT ON BOOKS
4863-258985-0032 THE OBJECT OF WHICH IS TO STIMULATE INVENTION RESEARCH AND WRITING BY GIVING THE FULL CONTROL AND PROTECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO THE INVENTOR AND WRITER OR THEIR ASSIGNEES IN THIS CASE THE PRIVILEGE IS SOCIALLY EARNED BY THE MONOPOLIST IT IS NOT GOTTEN FOR NOTHING
4863-258985-0033 MOREOVER THE PATENT IS LIMITED IN TIME EXPIRES AND BECOMES A SOCIAL POSSESSION A THIRD KIND IS A GOVERNMENT MONOPOLY FOR PURPOSES OF REVENUE IN FRANCE THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLS THE TOBACCO TRADE
4863-258985-0034 AND THE HIGH PRICE CHARGED FOR TOBACCO MAKES THE MONOPOLY YIELD A LARGE INCOME A FOURTH KIND
4863-258985-0035 FOR PUBLIC SERVICE AS STREET RAILWAYS LIGHTS GAS WATERWORKS ET CETERA THESE ARE GRANTED TO PRIVATE CAPITALISTS TO INDUCE THEM TO INVEST CAPITAL IN SOMETHING
4863-258985-0036 ECONOMIC MONOPOLY ARISES WHEN THE OWNERSHIP OF SCARCE NATURAL AGENTS AS MINES LAND WATER POWER COMES UNDER THE CONTROL OF ONE MAN OR ONE GROUP OF MEN WHO AGREE ON A PRICE ECONOMIC MONOPOLY
4863-258985-0037 IS A RESULT OF PRIVATE PROPERTY THAT IS UNDESIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT OR BY SOCIETY IT IS EXCEPTIONAL CONSIDERING THE WHOLE RANGE OF PRIVATE PROPERTY BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THE OIL WELLS EMBRACING THE MAIN SOURCES OF THE WORLD'S SUPPLY
4863-258985-0038 HAVE COME UNDER ONE CONTROL ONE CORPORATION
4863-258985-0039 AS TO BE ABLE TO FIX A PRICE DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH WOULD RESULT UNDER COMPETITION COAL MINES ESPECIALLY THOSE OF SOME PECULIAR AND LIMITED KIND SUCH AS ANTHRACITE APPEAR TO BECOME EASILY AN OBJECT OF MONOPOLIZATION
4863-258985-0040 PRIVATE CONTROL OF GREAT NATURAL RESOURCES DOUBTLESS WOULD HAVE BEEN PROHIBITED
4863-258985-0041 COMMERCIAL MONOPOLY VARIOUSLY CALLED CONTRACTUAL ORGANIZED OR CAPITALISTIC MONOPOLY ARISES WHERE MEN UNITE THEIR WEALTH TO CONTROL A MARKET TO OVERPOWER OR INTIMIDATE OPPOSITION AND TO KEEP OUT OR LIMIT COMPETITION
4863-258985-0042 BY THE MERE MAGNITUDE OF THEIR WEALTH THESE VARIOUS KINDS SO MERGE INTO EACH OTHER THAT THEY CANNOT ALWAYS BE DISTINGUISHED IN PRACTICE
