3587-140711-0000 JOHN TELLS ME HOW MUCH YOU LONG FOR MY COMING BUT HE SAYS HE TOLD YOU HE HOPED SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO HINDER IT I AM GLAD YOU DID NOT TELL HIM THE OCCASION OF MY COMING AWAY FOR IF MY FELLOW SERVANTS SHOULD GUESS IT WERE BETTER SO THAN TO HAVE IT FROM YOU OR ME
3587-140711-0001 BESIDES I REALLY AM CONCERNED THAT MY MASTER SHOULD CAST AWAY A THOUGHT UPON SUCH A POOR CREATURE AS ME FOR BESIDES THE DISGRACE IT HAS QUITE TURNED HIS TEMPER AND I BEGIN TO BELIEVE WHAT MISSUS JERVIS TOLD ME
3587-140711-0002 THAT HE LIKES ME AND CAN'T HELP IT AND YET STRIVES TO CONQUER IT AND SO FINDS NO WAY BUT TO BE CROSS TO ME DON'T THINK ME PRESUMPTUOUS AND CONCEITED FOR IT IS MORE MY CONCERN THAN MY PRIDE TO SEE SUCH A GENTLEMAN SO DEMEAN HIMSELF
3587-140711-0003 AND LESSEN THE REGARD HE USED TO HAVE IN THE EYES OF ALL HIS SERVANTS ON MY ACCOUNT BUT I AM TO TELL YOU OF MY NEW DRESS TO DAY AND SO WHEN I HAD DINED UP STAIRS I WENT AND LOCKED MYSELF INTO MY LITTLE ROOM
3587-140711-0004 THERE I TRICKED MYSELF UP AS WELL AS I COULD IN MY NEW GARB AND PUT ON MY ROUND EARED ORDINARY CAP BUT WITH A GREEN KNOT HOWEVER AND MY HOMESPUN GOWN AND PETTICOAT AND PLAIN LEATHER SHOES BUT YET THEY ARE WHAT THEY CALL SPANISH LEATHER
3587-140711-0005 AND MY ORDINARY HOSE ORDINARY I MEAN TO WHAT I HAVE BEEN LATELY USED TO THOUGH I SHALL THINK GOOD YARN MAY DO VERY WELL FOR EVERY DAY WHEN I COME HOME A PLAIN MUSLIN TUCKER I PUT ON AND MY BLACK SILK NECKLACE INSTEAD OF THE FRENCH NECKLACE MY LADY GAVE ME
3587-140711-0006 AND PUT THE EAR RINGS OUT OF MY EARS AND WHEN I WAS QUITE EQUIPPED I TOOK MY STRAW HAT IN MY HAND WITH ITS TWO BLUE STRINGS AND LOOKED ABOUT ME IN THE GLASS AS PROUD AS ANY THING TO SAY TRUTH
3587-140711-0007 I NEVER LIKED MYSELF SO WELL IN MY LIFE O THE PLEASURE OF DESCENDING WITH EASE INNOCENCE AND RESIGNATION INDEED THERE IS NOTHING LIKE IT AN HUMBLE MIND I PLAINLY SEE CANNOT MEET WITH ANY VERY SHOCKING DISAPPOINTMENT
3587-140711-0008 LET FORTUNE'S WHEEL TURN ROUND AS IT WILL SO I WENT DOWN TO LOOK FOR MISSUS JERVIS TO SEE HOW SHE LIKED ME I MET AS I WAS UPON THE STAIRS OUR RACHEL WHO IS THE HOUSE MAID AND SHE MADE ME A LOW COURTESY AND I FOUND
3587-140711-0009 DID NOT KNOW ME SO I SMILED AND WENT TO THE HOUSEKEEPER'S PARLOUR AND THERE SAT GOOD MISSUS JERVIS AT WORK MAKING A SHIFT AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT SHE DID NOT KNOW ME AT FIRST BUT ROSE UP AND PULLED OFF HER SPECTACLES AND SAID
3587-140711-0010 WHY YOU SURPRISE ME SAID SHE WHAT PAMELA THUS METAMORPHOSED HOW CAME THIS ABOUT AS IT HAPPENED IN STEPT MY MASTER
3587-140711-0011 AND MY BACK BEING TO HIM HE THOUGHT IT WAS A STRANGER SPEAKING TO MISSUS JERVIS AND WITHDREW AGAIN AND DID NOT HEAR HER ASK IF HIS HONOUR HAD ANY COMMANDS FOR HER
3587-140711-0012 AND SHE SAID SITTING DOWN WHY I AM ALL IN AMAZE I MUST SIT DOWN WHAT CAN ALL THIS MEAN
3587-140711-0013 AND SO IT WAS BETTER TO BEGIN HERE AS I WAS SOON TO GO AWAY THAT ALL MY FELLOW SERVANTS MIGHT SEE I KNEW HOW TO SUIT MYSELF TO THE STATE I WAS RETURNING TO WELL SAID SHE I NEVER KNEW THE LIKE OF THEE
3587-140711-0014 BUT THIS SAD PREPARATION FOR GOING AWAY FOR NOW I SEE YOU ARE QUITE IN EARNEST IS WHAT I KNOW NOT HOW TO GET OVER O MY DEAR PAMELA HOW CAN I PART WITH YOU MY MASTER RUNG IN THE BACK PARLOUR AND SO I WITHDREW AND MISSUS JERVIS WENT TO ATTEND HIM
3587-140711-0015 IT SEEMS HE SAID TO HER I WAS COMING IN TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I SHALL GO TO LINCOLNSHIRE
3587-140711-0016 AND BE ABSENT SOME WEEKS BUT PRAY WHAT PRETTY NEAT DAMSEL WAS WITH YOU SHE SAYS SHE SMILED AND ASKED IF HIS HONOUR DID NOT KNOW WHO IT WAS NO SAID HE I NEVER SAW HER BEFORE
3587-140711-0017 FARMER NICHOLS OR FARMER BRADY HAVE NEITHER OF THEM SUCH A TIGHT PRIM LASS FOR A DAUGHTER HAVE THEY THOUGH I DID NOT SEE HER FACE NEITHER SAID HE IF YOUR HONOUR WON'T BE ANGRY SAID SHE I WILL INTRODUCE HER INTO YOUR PRESENCE FOR I THINK SAYS SHE
3587-140711-0018 SHE OUTDOES OUR PAMELA NOW I DID NOT THANK HER FOR THIS AS I TOLD HER AFTERWARDS FOR IT BROUGHT A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE UPON ME AS WELL AS CROSSNESS AS YOU SHALL HEAR THAT CAN'T BE HE WAS PLEASED TO SAY
3587-140711-0019 FOR GOODNESS SAKE LET HIM FIND YOU OUT FOR HE DON'T KNOW YOU
3587-140711-0020 HOW COULD YOU SERVE ME SO BESIDES IT LOOKS TOO FREE BOTH IN ME AND TO HIM I TELL YOU SAID SHE YOU SHALL COME IN AND PRAY DON'T REVEAL YOURSELF TILL HE FINDS YOU OUT SO I WENT IN FOOLISH AS I WAS
3587-140711-0021 THOUGH I MUST HAVE BEEN SEEN BY HIM ANOTHER TIME IF I HAD NOT THEN AND SHE WOULD MAKE ME TAKE MY STRAW HAT IN MY HAND I DROPT A LOW COURTESY BUT SAID NEVER A WORD I DARE SAY HE KNEW ME AS SOON AS HE SAW MY FACE
3587-140711-0022 YOU FAR SURPASS YOUR SISTER PAMELA I WAS ALL CONFUSION AND WOULD HAVE SPOKEN BUT HE TOOK ME ABOUT THE NECK WHY SAID HE YOU ARE VERY PRETTY CHILD I WOULD NOT BE SO FREE WITH YOUR SISTER YOU MAY BELIEVE BUT I MUST KISS YOU
3587-140711-0023 O SIR SAID I I AM PAMELA INDEED I AM INDEED I AM PAMELA HER OWN SELF HE KISSED ME FOR ALL I COULD DO AND SAID IMPOSSIBLE YOU ARE A LOVELIER GIRL BY HALF THAN PAMELA
3587-140711-0024 AND SURE I MAY BE INNOCENTLY FREE WITH YOU THOUGH I WOULD NOT DO HER SO MUCH FAVOUR THIS WAS A SAD TRICK UPON ME INDEED AND WHAT I COULD NOT EXPECT AND MISSUS JERVIS LOOKED LIKE A FOOL AS MUCH AS I FOR HER OFFICIOUSNESS
3587-140711-0025 AT LAST I GOT AWAY AND RAN OUT OF THE PARLOUR MOST SADLY VEXED AS YOU MAY WELL THINK HE TALKED A GOOD DEAL TO MISSUS JERVIS AND AT LAST ORDERED ME TO COME IN TO HIM
3587-140711-0026 COME IN SAID HE YOU LITTLE VILLAIN FOR SO HE CALLED ME GOOD SIRS WHAT A NAME WAS THERE WHO IS IT YOU PUT YOUR TRICKS UPON
3587-140711-0027 YOU MUST DISGUISE YOURSELF TO ATTRACT ME AND YET PRETEND LIKE AN HYPOCRITE AS YOU ARE I WAS OUT OF PATIENCE THEN HOLD GOOD SIR SAID I DON'T IMPUTE DISGUISE AND HYPOCRISY TO ME

3587-140711-0032 I THOUGHT HE WAS MAD FOR MY SHARE FOR HE KNEW NOT WHAT HE WOULD HAVE I WAS GOING HOWEVER BUT HE STEPT AFTER ME AND TOOK HOLD OF MY ARM AND BROUGHT ME IN AGAIN
3587-140711-0033 HE SAT DOWN AND LOOKED AT ME AND AS I THOUGHT AFTERWARDS AS SILLILY AS SUCH A POOR GIRL AS I AT LAST HE SAID WELL MISSUS JERVIS AS I WAS TELLING YOU YOU MAY PERMIT HER TO STAY A LITTLE LONGER TILL I SEE IF MY SISTER DAVERS WILL HAVE HER IF
