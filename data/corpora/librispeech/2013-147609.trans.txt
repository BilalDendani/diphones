2013-147609-0000 MANY MANY CENTURIES AGO THERE LIVED TWO BROTHERS PROMETHEUS OR FORETHOUGHT
2013-147609-0001 DID NOT CARE FOR IDLE LIFE AMONG THE GODS ON MOUNT OLYMPUS INSTEAD HE PREFERRED TO SPEND HIS TIME ON THE EARTH HELPING MEN TO FIND EASIER AND BETTER WAYS OF LIVING
2013-147609-0002 IN THE GOLDEN DAYS WHEN SATURN RULED
2013-147609-0003 WITHOUT FIRE WITHOUT FOOD AND WITH NO SHELTER BUT MISERABLE CAVES WITH FIRE THEY COULD AT LEAST WARM THEIR BODIES AND COOK THEIR FOOD PROMETHEUS THOUGHT AND LATER THEY COULD MAKE TOOLS AND BUILD HOUSES FOR THEMSELVES
2013-147609-0004 AND ENJOY SOME OF THE COMFORTS OF THE GODS SO PROMETHEUS WENT TO JUPITER AND ASKED THAT HE MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO CARRY FIRE TO THE EARTH BUT JUPITER SHOOK HIS HEAD IN WRATH FIRE INDEED HE EXCLAIMED
2013-147609-0005 NEVER WILL I GIVE MY CONSENT PROMETHEUS MADE NO REPLY BUT HE DIDN'T GIVE UP HIS IDEA OF HELPING MEN SOME OTHER WAY MUST BE FOUND HE THOUGHT THEN ONE DAY AS HE WAS WALKING AMONG SOME REEDS
2013-147609-0006 HE BROKE OFF ONE AND SEEING THAT ITS HOLLOW STALK WAS FILLED WITH A DRY SOFT PITH EXCLAIMED AT LAST IN THIS I CAN CARRY FIRE
2013-147609-0007 IMMEDIATELY TAKING A LONG STALK IN HIS HANDS HE SET OUT FOR THE DWELLING OF THE SUN IN THE FAR EAST HE REACHED THERE IN THE EARLY MORNING JUST AS APOLLO'S CHARIOT WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN ITS JOURNEY ACROSS THE SKY
2013-147609-0008 LIGHTING HIS REED HE HURRIED BACK CAREFULLY GUARDING THE PRECIOUS SPARK THAT WAS HIDDEN IN THE HOLLOW STALK THEN HE SHOWED MEN HOW TO BUILD FIRES FOR THEMSELVES AND IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY BEGAN TO DO ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS
2013-147609-0009 OF WHICH PROMETHEUS HAD DREAMED THEY LEARNED TO COOK AND TO DOMESTICATE ANIMALS AND TO TILL THE FIELDS AND TO MINE PRECIOUS METALS AND MELT THEM INTO TOOLS AND WEAPONS AND THEY CAME OUT OF THEIR DARK AND GLOOMY CAVES
2013-147609-0010 THEY BEGAN TO LAUGH AND SING BEHOLD THE AGE OF GOLD HAS COME AGAIN THEY SAID BUT JUPITER WAS NOT SO HAPPY
2013-147609-0011 AND THEIR VERY PROSPERITY MADE HIM ANGRY THAT YOUNG TITAN HE CRIED OUT WHEN HE HEARD WHAT PROMETHEUS HAD DONE I WILL PUNISH HIM BUT BEFORE PUNISHING PROMETHEUS HE DECIDED TO VEX THE CHILDREN OF MEN
2013-147609-0012 WHEN THE WORK WAS DONE HE CARRIED IT TO OLYMPUS JUPITER CALLED THE OTHER GODS TOGETHER BIDDING THEM GIVE HER EACH A GIFT ONE BESTOWED UPON HER BEAUTY ANOTHER KINDNESS ANOTHER SKILL ANOTHER CURIOSITY AND SO ON
2013-147609-0013 JUPITER HIMSELF GAVE HER THE GIFT OF LIFE AND THEY NAMED HER PANDORA WHICH MEANS
2013-147609-0014 AT LAST SHE COULD NOT CONTAIN HER CURIOSITY ANY LONGER SHE OPENED THE BOX JUST A LITTLE TO TAKE A PEEP INSIDE IMMEDIATELY THERE WAS A BUZZING WHIRRING SOUND AND BEFORE SHE COULD SNAP DOWN THE LID TEN THOUSAND UGLY LITTLE CREATURES HAD JUMPED OUT
2013-147609-0015 THEY WERE DISEASES AND TROUBLES AND VERY GLAD THEY WERE TO BE FREE ALL OVER THE EARTH THEY FLEW ENTERING INTO EVERY HOUSEHOLD AND CARRYING SORROW AND DISTRESS WHEREVER THEY WENT HOW JUPITER MUST HAVE LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW THE RESULT OF PANDORA'S CURIOSITY
2013-147609-0016 SOON AFTER THIS THE GOD DECIDED THAT IT WAS TIME TO PUNISH PROMETHEUS HE CALLED STRENGTH AND FORCE AND BADE THEM SEIZE THE TITAN AND CARRY HIM TO THE HIGHEST PEAK OF THE CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS
2013-147609-0017 THEN HE SENT VULCAN TO BIND HIM WITH IRON CHAINS MAKING ARMS AND FEET FAST TO THE ROCKS VULCAN WAS SORRY FOR PROMETHEUS BUT DARED NOT DISOBEY SO THE FRIEND OF MAN LAY
2013-147609-0018 MISERABLY BOUND NAKED TO THE WINDS WHILE THE STORMS BEAT ABOUT HIM AND AN EAGLE TORE AT HIS LIVER WITH ITS CRUEL TALONS BUT PROMETHEUS DID NOT UTTER A GROAN IN SPITE OF ALL HIS SUFFERINGS
2013-147609-0019 AND YET HE WOULD NOT COMPLAIN BEG FOR MERCY OR REPENT OF WHAT HE HAD DONE MEN WERE SORRY FOR HIM BUT COULD DO NOTHING THEN ONE DAY A BEAUTIFUL WHITE COW PASSED OVER THE MOUNTAIN
2013-147609-0020 GO SOUTHWARD AND THEN WEST UNTIL YOU COME TO THE GREAT RIVER NILE THERE YOU SHALL AGAIN BECOME A MAIDEN FAIRER THAN EVER BEFORE AND SHALL MARRY THE KING OF THAT COUNTRY
2013-147609-0021 AND FROM YOUR RACE SHALL SPRING THE HERO WHO WILL BREAK MY CHAINS AND SET ME FREE CENTURIES PASSED AND THEN A GREAT HERO HERCULES CAME TO THE CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS
