3551-7884-0000 CITIZEN DEPUTY WHEN PRESENTLY THE YOUNG GIRL AWOKE WITH A DELICIOUS FEELING OF REST AND WELL BEING SHE HAD PLENTY OF LEISURE TO THINK
3551-7884-0001 SHE WAS ACTUALLY A GUEST A RESCUED PROTEGE
3551-7884-0002 WHOM SHE HAD SWORN BEFORE HER GOD AND BEFORE HER FATHER TO PURSUE WITH HATRED AND REVENGE TEN YEARS HAD GONE BY SINCE THEN LYING UPON THE SWEET SCENTED BED WHICH THE HOSPITALITY OF THE DEROULEDES HAD PROVIDED FOR HER
3551-7884-0003 SHE SEEMED TO SEE PASSING BEFORE HER THE SPECTRES OF THESE PAST TEN YEARS THE FIRST FOUR AFTER HER BROTHER'S DEATH
3551-7884-0004 HER WHOLE SOUL YEARNED FOR A SECLUDED A RELIGIOUS LIFE FOR GREAT BARRIERS OF SOLEMN VOWS AND DAYS SPENT IN PRAYER AND CONTEMPLATION TO INTERPOSE BETWEEN HERSELF AND THE MEMORY OF THAT AWFUL NIGHT WHEN
3551-7884-0005 SHE HAD MADE THE SOLEMN OATH TO AVENGE HER BROTHER'S DEATH SHE WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN WHEN SHE FIRST ENTERED THE CONVENT DIRECTLY AFTER HER FATHER'S DEATH WHEN SHE FELT VERY LONELY BOTH MORALLY AND MENTALLY LONELY AND FOLLOWED BY THE OBSESSION OF THAT OATH
3551-7884-0006 AND HE A SIMPLE MINDED MAN OF GREAT LEARNING AND A TOTAL LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD WAS COMPLETELY AT A LOSS HOW TO ADVISE THE ARCHBISHOP WAS CONSULTED HE COULD GRANT A DISPENSATION AND RELEASE HER OF THAT MOST SOLEMN VOW
3551-7884-0007 WHEN FIRST THIS IDEA WAS SUGGESTED TO HER JULIETTE WAS EXULTANT HER ENTIRE NATURE WHICH IN ITSELF WAS WHOLESOME LIGHT HEARTED THE VERY REVERSE OF MORBID REBELLED AGAINST THIS UNNATURAL TASK PLACED UPON HER YOUNG SHOULDERS IT WAS ONLY RELIGION
3551-7884-0008 THE STRANGE WARPED RELIGION OF THAT EXTRAORDINARY AGE WHICH KEPT HER TO IT WHICH FORBADE HER BREAKING LIGHTLY THAT MOST UNNATURAL OATH THE ARCHBISHOP WAS A MAN OF MANY DUTIES MANY ENGAGEMENTS HE AGREED TO GIVE THIS STRANGE CAS DE CONSCIENCE HIS MOST EARNEST ATTENTION
3551-7884-0009 HE WOULD MAKE NO PROMISES BUT MADEMOISELLE DE MARNY WAS RICH A MUNIFICENT DONATION TO THE POOR OF PARIS OR TO SOME CAUSE DEAR TO THE HOLY FATHER HIMSELF MIGHT PERHAPS BE MORE ACCEPTABLE TO GOD THAN THE FULFILMENT OF A COMPULSORY VOW
3551-7884-0010 JULIETTE WITHIN THE CONVENT WALLS WAS WAITING PATIENTLY FOR THE ARCHBISHOP'S DECISION AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THE GREATEST UPHEAVAL THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN WAS BEGINNING TO SHAKE THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF FRANCE
3551-7884-0011 THE ARCHBISHOP HAD OTHER THINGS NOW TO THINK ABOUT THAN ISOLATED CASES OF CONSCIENCE HE FORGOT ALL ABOUT JULIETTE PROBABLY HE WAS BUSY CONSOLING A MONARCH FOR THE LOSS OF HIS THRONE AND PREPARING HIMSELF AND HIS ROYAL PATRON FOR THE SCAFFOLD
3551-7884-0012 THE CONVENT OF THE URSULINES WAS SCATTERED DURING THE TERROR EVERYONE REMEMBERS THE THERMIDOR MASSACRES AND THE THIRTY FOUR NUNS ALL DAUGHTERS OF ANCIENT FAMILIES OF FRANCE WHO WENT SO CHEERFULLY TO THE SCAFFOLD
3551-7884-0013 HOW OR WHY SHE HERSELF COULD NOT HAVE TOLD SHE WAS VERY YOUNG AND STILL A POSTULANT SHE WAS ALLOWED TO LIVE IN RETIREMENT WITH PETRONELLE HER OLD NURSE WHO HAD REMAINED FAITHFUL THROUGH ALL THESE YEARS THEN THE ARCHBISHOP WAS PROSECUTED AND IMPRISONED
3551-7884-0014 JULIETTE MADE FRANTIC EFFORTS TO SEE HIM BUT ALL IN VAIN WHEN HE DIED SHE LOOKED UPON HER SPIRITUAL GUIDE'S DEATH AS A DIRECT WARNING FROM GOD THAT NOTHING COULD RELIEVE HER OF HER OATH
3551-7884-0015 SHE HAD WATCHED THE TURMOILS OF THE REVOLUTION THROUGH THE ATTIC WINDOW OF HER TINY APARTMENT IN PARIS WAITED UPON BY FAITHFUL PETRONELLE SHE HAD BEEN FORCED TO LIVE ON THE SAVINGS OF THAT WORTHY OLD SOUL AS ALL HER PROPERTY ALL THE MARNY ESTATES
3551-7884-0016 THE DOT SHE TOOK WITH HER TO THE CONVENT EVERYTHING IN FACT HAD BEEN SEIZED BY THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT SELF APPOINTED TO LEVEL FORTUNES AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS
3551-7884-0017 FROM THAT ATTIC WINDOW SHE HAD SEEN BEAUTIFUL PARIS WRITHING UNDER THE PITILESS LASH OF THE DEMON OF TERROR WHICH IT HAD PROVOKED SHE HAD HEARD THE RUMBLE OF THE TUMBRILS DRAGGING DAY AFTER DAY THEIR LOAD OF VICTIMS TO THE INSATIABLE MAKER OF THIS REVOLUTION OF FRATERNITY THE GUILLOTINE
3551-7884-0018 SHE HAD SEEN THE GAY LIGHT HEARTED PEOPLE OF THIS STAR CITY TURNED TO HOWLING BEASTS OF PREY ITS WOMEN CHANGED TO SEXLESS VULTURES WITH MURDEROUS TALONS IMPLANTED IN EVERYTHING THAT IS NOBLE HIGH OR BEAUTIFUL
3551-7884-0019 TWO YEARS LATER SHE HAD HEARD THE CRIES OF AN ENTIRE PEOPLE EXULTING OVER A REGICIDE
3551-7884-0020 THE PALE FACED LARGE EYED CHARLOTTE WHO HAD COMMITED A CRIME FOR THE SAKE OF A CONVICTION GREATER THAN BRUTUS SOME HAD CALLED HER GREATER THAN JOAN OF ARC
3551-7884-0021 FOR IT WAS TO A MISSION OF EVIL AND OF SIN THAT SHE WAS CALLED FROM THE DEPTHS OF HER BRETON VILLAGE AND NOT TO ONE OF GLORY AND TRIUMPH GREATER THAN BRUTUS JULIETTE FOLLOWED THE TRIAL OF CHARLOTTE CORDAY WITH ALL THE PASSIONATE ARDOUR OF HER EXALTED TEMPERAMENT
3551-7884-0022 JUST THINK WHAT AN EFFECT IT MUST HAVE HAD UPON THE MIND OF THIS YOUNG GIRL WHO FOR NINE YEARS THE BEST OF HER LIFE HAD ALSO LIVED WITH THE IDEA OF A SUBLIME MISSION PERVADING HER VERY SOUL SHE WATCHED CHARLOTTE CORDAY AT HER TRIAL
3551-7884-0023 CONQUERING HER NATURAL REPULSION FOR SUCH SCENES AND THE CROWDS WHICH USUALLY WATCHED THEM SHE HAD FORCED HER WAY INTO THE FOREMOST RANK OF THE NARROW GALLERY WHICH OVERLOOKED THE HALL OF THE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL SHE HEARD THE INDICTMENT
3551-7884-0024 HEARD TINVILLE'S SPEECH AND THE CALLING OF THE WITNESSES ALL THIS IS UNNECESSARY I KILLED MARAT JULIETTE HEARD THE FRESH YOUNG VOICE RINGING OUT CLEARLY ABOVE THE MURMUR OF VOICES THE HOWLS OF EXECRATION SHE SAW THE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG FACE CLEAR CALM IMPASSIVE
3551-7884-0025 I KILLED MARAT AND THERE IN THE SPECIAL SPACE ALLOTTED TO THE CITIZEN DEPUTIES SITTING AMONG THOSE WHO REPRESENTED THE PARTY OF THE MODERATE GIRONDE WAS PAUL DEROULEDE THE MAN WHOM SHE HAD SWORN TO PURSUE WITH A VENGEANCE AS GREAT AS COMPLETE
3551-7884-0026 AS THAT WHICH GUIDED CHARLOTTE CORDAY'S HAND SHE WATCHED HIM DURING THE TRIAL AND WONDERED IF HE HAD ANY PRESENTIMENT OF THE HATRED WHICH DOGGED HIM
3551-7884-0027 HE WAS VERY DARK ALMOST SWARTHY A SON OF THE SOUTH WITH BROWN HAIR FREE FROM POWDER THROWN BACK AND REVEALING THE BROW OF A STUDENT RATHER THAN THAT OF A LEGISLATOR HE WATCHED CHARLOTTE CORDAY EARNESTLY
3551-7884-0028 AND JULIETTE WHO WATCHED HIM SAW THE LOOK OF MEASURELESS PITY WHICH SOFTENED THE OTHERWISE HARD LOOK OF HIS CLOSE SET EYES HE MADE AN IMPASSIONED SPEECH FOR THE DEFENCE A SPEECH WHICH HAS BECOME HISTORIC IT WOULD HAVE COST ANY OTHER MAN HIS HEAD JULIETTE MARVELLED AT HIS COURAGE
3551-7884-0029 MARAT WHOM HIS FUNERAL ORATORS HAD COMPARED TO THE GREAT THE SACRED LEVELLER OF MANKIND
3551-7884-0030 IT WAS AN APPEAL THE MOST ELOQUENT MAN OF THAT ELOQUENT AGE
3551-7884-0031 EVERYONE ROUND JULIETTE LISTENED AS HE SPOKE
3551-7884-0032 WHISPERED THE BLOODTHIRSTY AMAZONS WHO SAT KNITTING IN THE GALLERY BUT THERE WAS NO FURTHER COMMENT A HUGE MAGNIFICENTLY EQUIPPED HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHILDREN HAD BEEN THROWN OPEN IN PARIS THAT VERY MORNING A GIFT TO THE NATION FROM CITOYEN DEROULEDE
3551-7884-0033 SURELY HE WAS PRIVILEGED TO TALK A LITTLE IF IT PLEASED HIM HIS HOSPITAL WOULD COVER QUITE A GOOD MANY DEFALCATIONS
3551-7884-0034 SANTERRE SHRUGGED THEIR SHOULDERS IT IS DEROULEDE
3551-7884-0035 JULIETTE HEARD IT ALL THE KNITTERS ROUND HER WERE TALKING LOUDLY EVEN CHARLOTTE WAS ALMOST FORGOTTEN WHILST DEROULEDE TALKED HE HAD A FINE VOICE OF STRONG CALIBRE WHICH ECHOED POWERFULLY THROUGH THE HALL HE WAS RATHER SHORT BUT BROAD SHOULDERED AND WELL KNIT
3551-7884-0036 WITH AN EXPRESSIVE HAND WHICH LOOKED SLENDER AND DELICATE BELOW THE FINE LACE RUFFLE CHARLOTTE CORDAY WAS CONDEMNED ALL DEROULEDE'S ELOQUENCE COULD NOT SAVE HER JULIETTE LEFT THE COURT IN A STATE OF MAD EXULTATION
3551-7884-0037 SHE WAS VERY YOUNG THE SCENES SHE HAD WITNESSED IN THE PAST TWO YEARS COULD NOT HELP BUT EXCITE THE IMAGINATION OF A YOUNG GIRL LEFT ENTIRELY TO HER OWN INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL RESOURCES WHAT SCENES GREAT GOD AND NOW TO WAIT FOR AN OPPORTUNITY
3551-7884-0038 CHARLOTTE CORDAY THE HALF EDUCATED LITTLE PROVINCIAL SHOULD NOT PUT TO SHAME MADEMOISELLE DE MARNY THE DAUGHTER OF A HUNDRED DUKES OF THOSE WHO HAD MADE FRANCE BEFORE SHE TOOK TO UNMAKING HERSELF BUT SHE COULD NOT FORMULATE ANY DEFINITE PLANS
3551-7884-0039 IMPULSE AND COINCIDENCE HAD WORKED THEIR WILL WITH HER SHE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT DAILY
3551-7884-0040 OSTENSIBLY TO GAZE AT MARAT'S DWELLING AS CROWDS OF IDLERS WERE WONT TO DO BUT REALLY IN ORDER TO LOOK AT DEROULEDE'S HOUSE ONCE OR TWICE SHE SAW HIM COMING OR GOING FROM HOME ONCE SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE INNER HALL AND OF A YOUNG GIRL IN A DARK KIRTLE AND SNOW WHITE KERCHIEF
3551-7884-0041 BIDDING HIM GOOD BYE AT HIS DOOR ANOTHER TIME SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET HELPING THAT SAME YOUNG GIRL OVER THE MUDDY PAVEMENT HE HAD JUST MET HER AND SHE WAS CARRYING A BASKET OF PROVISIONS HE TOOK IT FROM HER AND CARRIED IT TO THE HOUSE
3551-7884-0042 AND INNATELY SO EVIDENTLY FOR THE GIRL WAS SLIGHTLY DEFORMED HARDLY A HUNCHBACK BUT WEAK AND UNATTRACTIVE LOOKING WITH MELANCHOLY EYES AND A PALE PINCHED FACE IT WAS THE THOUGHT OF THAT LITTLE ACT OF SIMPLE CHIVALRY WITNESSED THE DAY BEFORE
3551-7884-0043 WHICH CAUSED JULIETTE TO PROVOKE THE SCENE WHICH BUT FOR DEROULEDE'S TIMELY INTERFERENCE MIGHT HAVE ENDED SO FATALLY BUT SHE RECKONED ON THAT INTERFERENCE THE WHOLE THING HAD OCCURRED TO HER SUDDENLY AND SHE HAD CARRIED IT THROUGH
3551-7884-0044 GOD WOULD SHOW HER A MEANS TO THE END AND NOW SHE WAS INSIDE THE HOUSE OF THE MAN WHO HAD MURDERED HER BROTHER AND SENT HER SORROWING FATHER A POOR SENSELESS MANIAC TOTTERING TO THE GRAVE
