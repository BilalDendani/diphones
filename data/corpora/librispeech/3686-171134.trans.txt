3686-171134-0000 WHAT CESTIUS DID AGAINST THE JEWS AND HOW UPON HIS BESIEGING JERUSALEM HE RETREATED FROM THE CITY WITHOUT ANY JUST OCCASION IN THE WORLD AS ALSO WHAT SEVERE CALAMITIES HE UNDER WENT FROM THE JEWS IN HIS RETREAT
3686-171134-0001 ONE AND NOW GALLUS SEEING NOTHING MORE THAT LOOKED TOWARDS AN INNOVATION IN GALILEE
3686-171134-0002 SO THEY CAME AND FINDING THEIR CAMP DESERTED THEY BURNT IT AS WELL AS THE VILLAGES THAT LAY ABOUT IT
3686-171134-0003 HE FOUND THE CITY EMPTY OF ITS MEN
3686-171134-0004 AND SO MARCHED FORWARDS AND ASCENDING BY BETBORON
3686-171134-0005 FIFTY FURLONGS DISTANT FROM JERUSALEM TWO BUT AS FOR THE JEWS WHEN THEY SAW THE WAR APPROACHING TO THEIR METROPOLIS THEY LEFT THE FEAST AND BETOOK THEMSELVES TO THEIR ARMS
3686-171134-0006 AND TAKING COURAGE GREATLY FROM THEIR MULTITUDE WENT IN A SUDDEN AND DISORDERLY MANNER TO THE FIGHT WITH A GREAT NOISE AND WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERATION HAD OF THE REST OF THE SEVENTH DAY
3686-171134-0007 WITH SUCH VIOLENCE THEREFORE DID THEY FALL UPON THE ROMANS AS TO BREAK INTO THEIR RANKS AND TO MARCH THROUGH THE MIDST OF THEM MAKING A GREAT SLAUGHTER AS THEY WENT INSOMUCH THAT UNLESS THE HORSEMEN AND SUCH PART OF THE FOOTMEN
3686-171134-0008 AS WERE NOT YET TIRED IN THE ACTION HAD WHEELED ROUND AND SUCCORED THAT PART OF THE ARMY WHICH WAS NOT YET BROKEN
3686-171134-0009 HOWEVER FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN OF THE ROMANS WERE SLAIN OF WHICH NUMBER FOUR HUNDRED WERE FOOTMEN AND THE REST HORSEMEN WHILE THE JEWS LOST ONLY TWENTY TWO OF WHOM THE MOST VALIANT WERE THE KINSMEN OF MONOBAZUS
3686-171134-0010 WHEN THE FRONT OF THE JEWISH ARMY HAD BEEN CUT OFF THE JEWS RETIRED INTO THE CITY BUT STILL SIMON THE SON OF GIORA FELL UPON THE BACKS OF THE ROMANS AS THEY WERE ASCENDING UP BETHORON
3686-171134-0011 AND PUT THE HINDMOST OF THE ARMY INTO DISORDER AND CARRIED OFF MANY OF THE BEASTS THAT CARRIED THE WEAPONS OF WAR AND LED SHEM INTO THE CITY BUT AS CESTIUS TARRIED THERE THREE DAYS THE JEWS SEIZED UPON THE ELEVATED PARTS OF THE CITY
3686-171134-0012 AND SET WATCHES AT THE ENTRANCES INTO THE CITY AND APPEARED OPENLY RESOLVED NOT TO REST WHEN ONCE THE ROMANS SHOULD BEGIN TO MARCH THREE AND NOW WHEN AGRIPPA OBSERVED
3686-171134-0013 THAT EVEN THE AFFAIRS OF THE ROMANS WERE LIKELY TO BE IN DANGER WHILE SUCH AN IMMENSE MULTITUDE OF THEIR ENEMIES HAD SEIZED UPON THE MOUNTAINS ROUND ABOUT HE DETERMINED TO TRY WHAT THE JEWS WOULD AGREE TO BY WORDS
3686-171134-0014 AS THINKING THAT HE SHOULD EITHER PERSUADE THEM ALL TO DESIST FROM FIGHTING OR HOWEVER THAT HE SHOULD CAUSE THE SOBER PART OF THEM TO SEPARATE THEMSELVES FROM THE OPPOSITE PARTY
3686-171134-0015 TO SECURE THEM OF THE ROMANS ENTIRE FORGIVENESS OF WHAT THEY HAD DONE AMISS
3686-171134-0016 ACCORDINGLY THEY SLEW PHEBUS BEFORE HE SAID A WORD BUT BORCEUS WAS ONLY WOUNDED AND SO PREVENTED HIS FATE BY FLYING AWAY AND WHEN THE PEOPLE WERE VERY ANGRY AT THIS THEY HAD THE SEDITIOUS BEATEN WITH STONES AND CLUBS
3686-171134-0017 AFFORDED HIM A PROPER OPPORTUNITY TO ATTACK THEM TOOK HIS WHOLE ARMY ALONG WITH HIM AND PUT THE JEWS TO FLIGHT AND PURSUED THEM TO JERUSALEM HE THEN PITCHED HIS CAMP UPON THE ELEVATION CALLED SCOPUS OR WATCH TOWER
3686-171134-0018 WHICH WAS DISTANT SEVEN FURLONGS FROM THE CITY
3686-171134-0019 OUT OF EXPECTATION THAT THOSE WITHIN MIGHT PERHAPS YIELD A LITTLE
3686-171134-0020 TO SEIZE UPON THEIR CORN AND ON THE FOURTH DAY
3686-171134-0021 HE BROUGHT IT INTO THE CITY NOW FOR THE PEOPLE THEY WERE KEPT UNDER BY THE SEDITIOUS BUT THE SEDITIOUS THEMSELVES WERE GREATLY AFFRIGHTED AT THE GOOD ORDER OF THE ROMANS AND RETIRED FROM THE SUBURBS AND RETREATED INTO THE INNER PART OF THE CITY AND INTO THE TEMPLE
3686-171134-0022 HE SET THE PART CALLED BEZETHA
3686-171134-0023 OR THE NEW CITY ON FIRE AS HE DID ALSO TO THE TIMBER MARKET AFTER WHICH HE CAME INTO THE UPPER CITY AND PITCHED HIS CAMP OVER AGAINST THE ROYAL PALACE AND HAD HE BUT AT THIS VERY TIME ATTEMPTED TO GET WITHIN THE WALLS BY FORCE
3686-171134-0024 HE HAD WON THE CITY PRESENTLY AND THE WAR HAD BEEN PUT AN END TO AT ONCE
3686-171134-0025 AND A GREAT NUMBER OF THE OFFICERS OF THE HORSE HAD BEEN CORRUPTED BY FLORUS
3686-171134-0026 AND THAT WAS THE OCCASION THAT THIS WAR LASTED SO VERY LONG AND THEREBY THE JEWS WERE INVOLVED IN SUCH INCURABLE CALAMITIES FIVE
3686-171134-0027 AND WERE ABOUT TO OPEN THE GATES FOR HIM BUT HE OVERLOOKED THIS OFFER PARTLY OUT OF HIS ANGER AT THE JEWS AND PARTLY BECAUSE HE DID NOT THOROUGHLY BELIEVE THEY WERE IN EARNEST
3686-171134-0028 WHENCE IT WAS THAT HE DELAYED THE MATTER SO LONG THAT THE SEDITIOUS PERCEIVED THE TREACHERY AND THREW ANANUS AND THOSE OF HIS PARTY DOWN FROM THE WALL AND PELTING THEM WITH STONES DROVE THEM INTO THEIR HOUSES
3686-171134-0029 BUT THEY STOOD THEMSELVES AT PROPER DISTANCES IN THE TOWERS AND THREW THEIR DARTS AT THOSE THAT WERE GETTING OVER THE WALL THUS DID THE ROMANS MAKE THEIR ATTACK AGAINST THE WALL FOR FIVE DAYS BUT TO NO PURPOSE
3686-171134-0030 AND WITH THEM THE ARCHERS AND ATTEMPTED TO BREAK INTO THE TEMPLE AT THE NORTHERN QUARTER OF IT BUT THE JEWS BEAT THEM OFF FROM THE CLOISTERS AND REPULSED THEM SEVERAL TIMES WHEN THEY WERE GOTTEN NEAR TO THE WALL
3686-171134-0031 TILL AT LENGTH THE MULTITUDE OF THE DARTS CUT THEM OFF AND MADE THEM RETIRE BUT THE FIRST RANK OF THE ROMANS RESTED THEIR SHIELDS UPON THE WALL AND SO DID THOSE THAT WERE BEHIND THEM AND THE LIKE DID THOSE THAT WERE STILL MORE BACKWARD
3686-171134-0032 AS THOUGH IT WERE TO BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY BUT THE PEOPLE UPON THIS TOOK COURAGE AND WHERE THE WICKED PART OF THE CITY GAVE GROUND THITHER DID THEY COME IN ORDER TO SET OPEN THE GATES
3686-171134-0033 WHO HAD HE BUT CONTINUED THE SIEGE A LITTLE LONGER HAD CERTAINLY TAKEN THE CITY BUT IT WAS I SUPPOSE OWING TO THE AVERSION GOD HAD ALREADY AT THE CITY AND THE SANCTUARY THAT HE WAS HINDERED FROM PUTTING AN END TO THE WAR THAT VERY DAY
3686-171134-0034 IT THEN HAPPENED THAT CESTIUS WAS NOT CONSCIOUS EITHER HOW THE BESIEGED DESPAIRED OF SUCCESS NOR HOW COURAGEOUS THE PEOPLE WERE FOR HIM AND SO HE RECALLED HIS SOLDIERS FROM THE PLACE
3686-171134-0035 AND BY DESPAIRING OF ANY EXPECTATION OF TAKING IT WITHOUT HAVING RECEIVED ANY DISGRACE HE RETIRED FROM THE CITY WITHOUT ANY REASON IN THE WORLD BUT WHEN THE ROBBERS PERCEIVED THIS UNEXPECTED RETREAT OF HIS THEY RESUMED THEIR COURAGE
3686-171134-0036 AND DESTROYED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF BOTH THEIR HORSEMEN AND FOOTMEN
3686-171134-0037 AND AS HE WENT OFF FARTHER NEXT DAY HE THEREBY INVITED THE ENEMY TO FOLLOW HIM WHO STILL FELL UPON THE HINDMOST AND DESTROYED THEM THEY ALSO FELL UPON THE FLANK ON EACH SIDE OF THE ARMY
3686-171134-0038 AND THREW DARTS UPON THEM OBLIQUELY NOR DURST THOSE THAT WERE HINDMOST TURN BACK UPON THOSE WHO WOUNDED THEM BEHIND AS IMAGINING THAT THE MULTITUDE OF THOSE THAT PURSUED THEM WAS IMMENSE
3686-171134-0039 WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO REVENGE THEMSELVES UPON THEIR ENEMIES SO THEY WERE GALLED ALL THE WAY AND THEIR RANKS WERE PUT INTO DISORDER AND THOSE THAT WERE THUS PUT OUT OF THEIR RANKS WERE SLAIN AMONG WHOM WERE PRISCUS
3686-171134-0040 THE COMMANDER OF THE SIXTH LEGION AND LONGINUS THE TRIBUNE AND EMILIUS SECUNDUS THE COMMANDER OF A TROOP OF HORSEMEN SO IT WAS NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
3686-171134-0041 AND WAS IN GREAT DISTRESS TO KNOW WHAT HE SHOULD DO IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT WHEN ON THE THIRD DAY HE SAW A STILL MUCH GREATER NUMBER OF ENEMIES AND ALL THE PARTS ROUND ABOUT HIM FULL OF JEWS HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HIS DELAY WAS TO HIS OWN DETRIMENT
3686-171134-0042 SO THEY KILLED THE MULES AND OTHER CREATURES EXCEPTING THOSE THAT CARRIED THEIR DARTS AND MACHINES WHICH THEY RETAINED FOR THEIR OWN USE AND THIS PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID LEST THE JEWS SHOULD SEIZE UPON THEM
3686-171134-0043 OVER AGAINST THE NECK OF THE PASSAGE AND COVERED THE ROMAN ARMY WITH THEIR DARTS IN WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES AS THE FOOTMEN KNEW NOT HOW TO DEFEND THEMSELVES SO THE DANGER PRESSED THE HORSEMEN STILL MORE FOR THEY WERE SO PELTED
3686-171134-0044 AND THE ASCENTS WERE SO HIGH THAT THE CAVALRY WERE NOT ABLE TO MARCH AGAINST THE ENEMY THE PRECIPICES ALSO AND VALLEYS INTO WHICH THEY FREQUENTLY FELL AND TUMBLED DOWN WERE SUCH ON EACH SIDE OF THEM
3686-171134-0045 AND TO SUCH MOURNFUL CRIES AS MEN USE IN THE UTMOST DESPAIR THE JOYFUL ACCLAMATIONS OF THE JEWS ALSO AS THEY ENCOURAGED ONE ANOTHER ECHOED THE SOUNDS BACK AGAIN THESE LAST COMPOSING A NOISE OF THOSE
3686-171134-0046 THAT AT ONCE REJOICED AND WERE IN A RAGE INDEED THINGS WERE COME TO SUCH A PASS
3686-171134-0047 HAD NOT THE NIGHT COME ON WHEN THE ROMANS FLED TO BETHORON AND THE JEWS SEIZED UPON ALL THE PLACES ROUND ABOUT THEM AND WATCHED FOR THEIR COMING OUT IN THE MORNING NINE
3686-171134-0048 CONTRIVED HOW HE MIGHT BEST RUN AWAY AND WHEN HE HAD SELECTED FOUR HUNDRED OF THE MOST COURAGEOUS OF HIS SOLDIERS HE PLACED THEM AT THE STRONGEST OF THEIR FORTIFICATIONS AND GAVE ORDER THAT WHEN THEY WENT UP TO THE MORNING GUARD THEY SHOULD ERECT THEIR ENSIGNS
3686-171134-0049 AND MARCHED WITHOUT ANY NOISE THIRTY FURLONGS BUT WHEN THE JEWS PERCEIVED IN THE MORNING THAT THE CAMP WAS EMPTY THEY RAN UPON THOSE FOUR HUNDRED WHO HAD DELUDED THEM AND IMMEDIATELY THREW THEIR DARTS AT THEM AND SLEW THEM
3686-171134-0050 AND THEN PURSUED AFTER CESTIUS BUT HE HAD ALREADY MADE USE OF A GREAT PART OF THE NIGHT IN HIS FLIGHT AND STILL MARCHED QUICKER WHEN IT WAS DAY
3686-171134-0051 AND FOR THROWING OF STONES AND A GREAT PART OF THE INSTRUMENTS OF WAR SO THE JEWS WENT ON PURSUING THE ROMANS AS FAR AS ANTIPATRIS AFTER WHICH SEEING THEY COULD NOT OVERTAKE THEM THEY CAME BACK
3686-171134-0052 AND TOOK THE ENGINES AND SPOILED THE DEAD BODIES AND GATHERED THE PREY TOGETHER WHICH THE ROMANS HAD LEFT BEHIND THEM AND CAME BACK RUNNING AND SINGING TO THEIR METROPOLIS WHILE THEY HAD THEMSELVES LOST A FEW ONLY
3686-171134-0053 BUT HAD SLAIN OF THE ROMANS FIVE THOUSAND AND THREE HUNDRED FOOTMEN AND THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY HORSEMEN
