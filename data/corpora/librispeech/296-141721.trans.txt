296-141721-0000 THE AENIGMAS OR RIDDLES ZADIG AS ONE BESIDE HIMSELF AND PERFECTLY THUNDER STRUCK BEAT HIS MARCH AT RANDOM HE ENTRED HOWEVER INTO THE CITY OF BABYLON
296-141721-0001 ON THAT VERY DAY WHEN THOSE COMBATANTS WHO HAD BEEN BEFORE ENGAG'D IN THE LIST OR CIRCUS WERE ALREADY ASSEMBLED IN THE SPACIOUS OUTER COURT OF THE PALACE
296-141721-0002 ALL IN GENERAL WERE LAVISH OF THEIR PRAISES AND IN THEIR HEARTS WISH'D HIM THEIR SOVEREIGN EXCEPT THE ENVIOUS MAN WHO AS HE PASS'D BY FETCH'D A DEEP SIGH AND TURN'D HIS HEAD ASIDE THE POPULACE
296-141721-0003 WITH LOUD ACCLAMATIONS ATTENDED HIM TO THE PALACE GATE THE QUEEN WHO HAD HEARD OF HIS ARRIVAL WAS IN THE UTMOST AGONY BETWEEN HOPE AND DESPAIR HER VEXATION HAD ALMOST BROUGHT HER TO DEATH'S DOOR
296-141721-0004 SHE COULDN'T CONCEIVE WHY ZADIG SHOULD APPEAR WITHOUT HIS ACCOUTREMENTS NOR IMAGINE WHICH WAY ITOBAD COULD PROCURE THE SNOW WHITE ARMOUR AT THE SIGHT OF ZADIG A CONFUS'D MURMUR RAN THRO THE WHOLE PLACE
296-141721-0005 THO ANOTHER APPEARS CLAD IN MY ARMOUR BUT IN THE MEAN TIME BEFORE I CAN POSSIBLY PROVE MY ASSERTION I INSIST UPON BEING ADMITTED INTO COURT
296-141721-0006 WHAT IS THE LONGEST AND YET THE SHORTEST THING IN THE WORLD THE MOST SWIFT AND THE MOST SLOW THE MOST DIVISIBLE AND THE MOST EXTENDED THE LEAST VALU'D AND THE MOST REGRETTED
296-141721-0007 AND WITHOUT WHICH NOTHING CAN POSSIBLY BE DONE WHICH IN A WORD DEVOURS EVERY THING HOW MINUTE SOEVER AND YET GIVES LIFE AND SPIRIT TO EVERY OBJECT OR BEING HOWEVER GREAT ITOBAD
296-141721-0008 NOTHING PASSES SO SLOWLY AS TIME TO HIM WHO IS IN EXPECTATION AND NOTHING SO SWIFT AS TIME TO HIM WHO IS IN THE PERFECT ENJOYMENT OF HIS WISHES IT'S EXTENT IS TO INFINITY IN THE WHOLE
296-141721-0009 AND DIVISIBLE TO INFINITY IN PART ALL MEN NEGLECT IT IN THE PASSAGE AND ALL REGRET THE LOSS OF IT WHEN TIS PAST NOTHING CAN POSSIBLY BE DONE WITHOUT IT IT BURIES IN OBLIVION WHATEVER IS UNWORTHY OF BEING TRANSMITTED
296-141721-0010 WITHOUT BEING EVER THANKFUL FOR IT WHICH WE ENJOY WITHOUT KNOWING HOW WE CAME BY IT WHICH WE GIVE AWAY TO OTHERS WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE TIS TO BE FOUND AND WHICH WE LOSE WITHOUT BEING ANY WAYS CONSCIOUS OF OUR MISFORTUNE
296-141721-0011 EACH PASS'D HIS VERDICT ZADIG WAS THE ONLY PERSON THAT CONCLUDED IT WAS LIFE HE SOLV'D EVERY A ENIGMA PROPOS'D WITH EQUAL FACILITY ITOBAD WHEN HE HEARD THE EXPLICATIONS
296-141721-0012 ALWAYS SAID THAT NOTHING IN THE WORLD WAS MORE EASY THAN TO SOLVE SUCH OBVIOUS QUESTIONS AND THAT HE COULD INTERPRET A THOUSAND OF THEM WITHOUT THE LEAST HESITATION WERE HE INCLIN'D TO TROUBLE HIS HEAD ABOUT SUCH TRIFLES
296-141721-0013 IN REGARD TO JUSTICE THE SOVEREIGN GOOD
296-141721-0014 ZADIG'S ANSWERS STILL CARRIED THE GREATEST WEIGHT WHAT PITY TIS SAID SOME WHO WERE PRESENT THAT ONE OF SO COMPREHENSIVE A GENIUS SHOULD MAKE SUCH A SCURVY CAVALIER MOST ILLUSTRIOUS GRANDEES

296-141721-0017 TO ENGAGE WITH THE USURPER OF THE WHITE ARMOUR WITH MY SWORD ONLY IN MY MANTLE AND BONNET AND TO TESTIFY THAT I ONLY WAS THE HAPPY VICTOR OF THE JUSTLY ADMIRED HOTTAM
296-141721-0018 HE DID NOT DOUBT BUT BEING PROPERLY ACCOUTRED WITH HIS HELMET HIS CUIRASS AND HIS BRACELETS HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HUE DOWN AN ANTAGONIST IN HIS MANTLE AND CAP AND NOTHING TO SKREEN HIM FROM HIS RESENTMENT BUT A SINGLE SABRE
296-141721-0019 ZADIG DREW HIS SWORD AND SALUTED THE QUEEN WITH IT WHO VIEW'D HIM WITH TRANSPORT MIX'D WITH FEAR ITOBAD DREW HIS BUT PAID HIS COMPLIMENTS TO NOBODY
296-141721-0020 UPON HIS FORT AS THE SWORDS MEN CALL IT BY WHICH MEANS ITOBAD'S SWORD WAS SNAPT IN TWO WITH THAT ZADIG IN AN INSTANT CLOS'D HIS ADVERSARY AND BY HIS SUPERIOR STRENGTH AS WELL AS SKILL

296-141721-0024 WHO AFTER SUCH A LONG SERIES OF MISFORTUNES NOW TASTED THE SWEETS OF SEEING HER DARLING ZADIG THOUGHT WORTHY IN THE OPINION OF THE WHOLE WORLD
296-141721-0025 NOW HE BEGAN TO REFLECT ON WHAT THE ANGEL JESRAD HAD SAID TO HIM NAY HE REFLECTED SO FAR BACK AS THE STORY OF THE ARABIAN ATOM OF DUST METAMORPHOSED INTO A DIAMOND
296-141721-0026 THE QUEEN AND HE ADOR'D THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE ZADIG PERMITTED MISSOUF THE FAIR COQUET TO MAKE HER CONQUESTS WHERE SHE COULD HE SENT COURIERS TO BRING THE FREE BOOTER ARBOGAD TO COURT
