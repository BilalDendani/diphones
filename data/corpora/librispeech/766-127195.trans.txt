766-127195-0000 INSTEAD OF KEEPING CLOSE TO ME AND TRYING TO OUST ME FROM THE SLIT THE CURATE HAD GONE BACK INTO THE SCULLERY I WAS STRUCK BY A SUDDEN THOUGHT I WENT BACK QUICKLY AND QUIETLY INTO THE SCULLERY IN THE DARKNESS I HEARD THE CURATE DRINKING
766-127195-0001 I SNATCHED IN THE DARKNESS AND MY FINGERS CAUGHT A BOTTLE OF BURGUNDY FOR A FEW MINUTES THERE WAS A TUSSLE THE BOTTLE STRUCK THE FLOOR AND BROKE
766-127195-0002 WE STOOD PANTING AND THREATENING EACH OTHER IN THE END I PLANTED MYSELF BETWEEN HIM AND THE FOOD AND TOLD HIM OF MY DETERMINATION TO BEGIN A DISCIPLINE I DIVIDED THE FOOD IN THE PANTRY INTO RATIONS TO LAST US TEN DAYS I WOULD NOT LET HIM EAT ANY MORE THAT DAY
766-127195-0003 I HAD BEEN DOZING BUT IN AN INSTANT I WAS AWAKE ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT WE SAT FACE TO FACE I WEARY BUT RESOLUTE AND HE WEEPING AND COMPLAINING OF HIS IMMEDIATE HUNGER
766-127195-0004 IT SEEMS NOW AN INTERMINABLE LENGTH OF TIME AND SO OUR WIDENED INCOMPATIBILITY ENDED AT LAST IN OPEN CONFLICT FOR TWO VAST DAYS WE STRUGGLED IN UNDERTONES AND WRESTLING CONTESTS THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I BEAT AND KICKED HIM MADLY TIMES WHEN I CAJOLED AND PERSUADED HIM
766-127195-0005 AND ONCE I TRIED TO BRIBE HIM WITH THE LAST BOTTLE OF BURGUNDY FOR THERE WAS A RAIN WATER PUMP FROM WHICH I COULD GET WATER BUT NEITHER FORCE NOR KINDNESS AVAILED HE WAS INDEED BEYOND REASON HE WOULD NEITHER DESIST FROM HIS ATTACKS ON THE FOOD NOR FROM HIS NOISY BABBLING TO HIMSELF
766-127195-0006 THE RUDIMENTARY PRECAUTIONS TO KEEP OUR IMPRISONMENT ENDURABLE HE WOULD NOT OBSERVE SLOWLY I BEGAN TO REALISE THE COMPLETE OVERTHROW OF HIS INTELLIGENCE TO PERCEIVE THAT MY SOLE COMPANION IN THIS CLOSE AND SICKLY DARKNESS WAS A MAN INSANE
766-127195-0007 FROM CERTAIN VAGUE MEMORIES I AM INCLINED TO THINK MY OWN MIND WANDERED AT TIMES I HAD STRANGE AND HIDEOUS DREAMS WHENEVER I SLEPT IT SOUNDS PARADOXICAL BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE WEAKNESS AND INSANITY OF THE CURATE WARNED ME BRACED ME AND KEPT ME A SANE MAN
766-127195-0008 AND NOTHING I COULD DO WOULD MODERATE HIS SPEECH IT IS JUST O GOD HE WOULD SAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT IS JUST ON ME AND MINE BE THE PUNISHMENT LAID WE HAVE SINNED WE HAVE FALLEN SHORT THERE WAS POVERTY SORROW
766-127195-0009 AND I HELD MY PEACE I PREACHED ACCEPTABLE FOLLY MY GOD WHAT FOLLY WHEN I SHOULD HAVE STOOD UP THOUGH I DIED FOR IT AND CALLED UPON THEM TO REPENT REPENT OPPRESSORS OF THE POOR AND NEEDY THE WINE PRESS OF GOD
766-127195-0010 THEN HE WOULD SUDDENLY REVERT TO THE MATTER OF THE FOOD I WITHHELD FROM HIM PRAYING BEGGING WEEPING AT LAST THREATENING HE BEGAN TO RAISE HIS VOICE I PRAYED HIM NOT TO HE PERCEIVED A HOLD ON ME
766-127195-0011 HE THREATENED HE WOULD SHOUT AND BRING THE MARTIANS UPON US FOR A TIME THAT SCARED ME
766-127195-0012 I DEFIED HIM ALTHOUGH I FELT NO ASSURANCE THAT HE MIGHT NOT DO THIS THING BUT THAT DAY AT ANY RATE HE DID NOT HE TALKED WITH HIS VOICE RISING SLOWLY THROUGH THE GREATER PART OF THE EIGHTH AND NINTH DAYS THREATS ENTREATIES MINGLED WITH A TORRENT OF HALF SANE
766-127195-0013 AND ALWAYS FROTHY REPENTANCE FOR HIS VACANT SHAM OF GOD'S SERVICE SUCH AS MADE ME PITY HIM THEN HE SLEPT AWHILE AND BEGAN AGAIN WITH RENEWED STRENGTH SO LOUDLY THAT I MUST NEEDS MAKE HIM DESIST BE STILL I IMPLORED
766-127195-0014 I HAVE BEEN STILL TOO LONG HE SAID IN A TONE THAT MUST HAVE REACHED THE PIT
766-127195-0015 WOE WOE TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH BY REASON OF THE OTHER VOICES OF THE TRUMPET SHUT UP I SAID RISING TO MY FEET AND IN A TERROR LEST THE MARTIANS SHOULD HEAR US FOR GOD'S SAKE NAY SHOUTED THE CURATE
766-127195-0016 AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE STANDING LIKEWISE AND EXTENDING HIS ARMS SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD IS UPON ME IN THREE STRIDES HE WAS AT THE DOOR LEADING INTO THE KITCHEN
766-127195-0017 I PUT OUT MY HAND AND FELT THE MEAT CHOPPER HANGING TO THE WALL IN A FLASH I WAS AFTER HIM I WAS FIERCE WITH FEAR
766-127195-0018 WITH ONE LAST TOUCH OF HUMANITY I TURNED THE BLADE BACK AND STRUCK HIM WITH THE BUTT HE WENT HEADLONG FORWARD AND LAY STRETCHED ON THE GROUND I STUMBLED OVER HIM AND STOOD PANTING HE LAY STILL SUDDENLY I HEARD A NOISE WITHOUT
766-127195-0019 THE RUN AND SMASH OF SLIPPING PLASTER AND THE TRIANGULAR APERTURE IN THE WALL WAS DARKENED I LOOKED UP AND SAW THE LOWER SURFACE OF A HANDLING MACHINE COMING SLOWLY ACROSS THE HOLE
766-127195-0020 ANOTHER LIMB APPEARED FEELING ITS WAY OVER THE FALLEN BEAMS I STOOD PETRIFIED STARING THEN I SAW THROUGH A SORT OF GLASS PLATE NEAR THE EDGE OF THE BODY THE FACE AS WE MAY CALL IT AND THE LARGE DARK EYES OF A MARTIAN PEERING
766-127195-0021 AND THEN A LONG METALLIC SNAKE OF TENTACLE CAME FEELING SLOWLY THROUGH THE HOLE I TURNED BY AN EFFORT STUMBLED OVER THE CURATE AND STOPPED AT THE SCULLERY DOOR THE TENTACLE WAS NOW SOME WAY TWO YARDS OR MORE IN THE ROOM
766-127195-0022 AND TWISTING AND TURNING WITH QUEER SUDDEN MOVEMENTS THIS WAY AND THAT FOR A WHILE I STOOD FASCINATED BY THAT SLOW FITFUL ADVANCE THEN WITH A FAINT HOARSE CRY I FORCED MYSELF ACROSS THE SCULLERY I TREMBLED VIOLENTLY
766-127195-0023 I COULD SCARCELY STAND UPRIGHT I OPENED THE DOOR OF THE COAL CELLAR AND STOOD THERE IN THE DARKNESS STARING AT THE FAINTLY LIT DOORWAY INTO THE KITCHEN AND LISTENING HAD THE MARTIAN SEEN ME WHAT WAS IT DOING NOW
766-127195-0024 SOMETHING WAS MOVING TO AND FRO THERE VERY QUIETLY EVERY NOW AND THEN IT TAPPED AGAINST THE WALL OR STARTED ON ITS MOVEMENTS WITH A FAINT METALLIC RINGING LIKE THE MOVEMENTS OF KEYS ON A SPLIT RING
766-127195-0025 THEN A HEAVY BODY I KNEW TOO WELL WHAT WAS DRAGGED ACROSS THE FLOOR OF THE KITCHEN TOWARDS THE OPENING IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTED
766-127195-0026 IN THE TRIANGLE OF BRIGHT OUTER SUNLIGHT I SAW THE MARTIAN IN ITS BRIAREUS OF A HANDLING MACHINE SCRUTINIZING THE CURATE'S HEAD
766-127195-0027 AND AS NOISELESSLY AS POSSIBLE IN THE DARKNESS AMONG THE FIREWOOD AND COAL THEREIN EVERY NOW AND THEN I PAUSED RIGID TO HEAR IF THE MARTIAN HAD THRUST ITS TENTACLES THROUGH THE OPENING AGAIN THEN THE FAINT METALLIC JINGLE RETURNED
766-127195-0028 I TRACED IT SLOWLY FEELING OVER THE KITCHEN PRESENTLY I HEARD IT NEARER IN THE SCULLERY AS I JUDGED I THOUGHT THAT ITS LENGTH MIGHT BE INSUFFICIENT TO REACH ME I PRAYED COPIOUSLY IT PASSED SCRAPING FAINTLY ACROSS THE CELLAR DOOR
766-127195-0029 AN AGE OF ALMOST INTOLERABLE SUSPENSE INTERVENED THEN I HEARD IT FUMBLING AT THE LATCH
766-127195-0030 THE MARTIANS UNDERSTOOD DOORS IT WORRIED AT THE CATCH FOR A MINUTE PERHAPS AND THEN THE DOOR OPENED IN THE DARKNESS I COULD JUST SEE THE THING LIKE AN ELEPHANT'S TRUNK MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
766-127195-0031 ONCE EVEN IT TOUCHED THE HEEL OF MY BOOT I WAS ON THE VERGE OF SCREAMING I BIT MY HAND FOR A TIME THE TENTACLE WAS SILENT I COULD HAVE FANCIED IT HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN PRESENTLY WITH AN ABRUPT CLICK IT GRIPPED SOMETHING I THOUGHT IT HAD ME
766-127195-0032 AND SEEMED TO GO OUT OF THE CELLAR AGAIN FOR A MINUTE I WAS NOT SURE APPARENTLY IT HAD TAKEN A LUMP OF COAL TO EXAMINE I SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF SLIGHTLY SHIFTING MY POSITION WHICH HAD BECOME CRAMPED AND THEN LISTENED
766-127195-0033 I WHISPERED PASSIONATE PRAYERS FOR SAFETY THEN I HEARD THE SLOW DELIBERATE SOUND CREEPING TOWARDS ME AGAIN SLOWLY SLOWLY IT DREW NEAR SCRATCHING AGAINST THE WALLS AND TAPPING THE FURNITURE
766-127195-0034 WHILE I WAS STILL DOUBTFUL IT RAPPED SMARTLY AGAINST THE CELLAR DOOR AND CLOSED IT I HEARD IT GO INTO THE PANTRY AND THE BISCUIT TINS RATTLED AND A BOTTLE SMASHED AND THEN CAME A HEAVY BUMP AGAINST THE CELLAR DOOR THEN SILENCE THAT PASSED
766-127195-0035 INTO AN INFINITY OF SUSPENSE HAD IT GONE AT LAST I DECIDED THAT IT HAD IT CAME INTO THE SCULLERY NO MORE BUT I LAY ALL THE TENTH DAY IN THE CLOSE DARKNESS
