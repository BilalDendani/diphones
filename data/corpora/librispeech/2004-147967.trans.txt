2004-147967-0008 HE DONE EVERYTHING NATURAL YOU KNOW HE WAS ALWAYS SORT OF FIXY
2004-147967-0009 HE SHAVED AFTER DINNER AND WASHED HISSELF ALL OVER AFTER THE GIRLS WAS DONE THE DISHES ANTONIA HEATED THE WATER FOR HIM THEN HE PUT ON A CLEAN SHIRT AND CLEAN SOCKS AND AFTER HE WAS DRESSED HE KISSED HER AND THE LITTLE ONE
2004-147967-0010 AND TOOK HIS GUN AND SAID HE WAS GOING OUT TO HUNT RABBITS HE MUST HAVE GONE RIGHT DOWN TO THE BARN AND DONE IT THEN HE LAYED DOWN ON THAT BUNK BED
2004-147967-0011 WHEN WE FOUND HIM EVERYTHING WAS DECENT EXCEPT FUCHS WRINKLED HIS BROW AND HESITATED
2004-147967-0012 HIS COAT WAS HUNG ON A PEG AND HIS BOOTS WAS UNDER THE BED HE'D TOOK OFF THAT SILK NECKCLOTH HE ALWAYS WORE AND FOLDED IT SMOOTH AND STUCK HIS PIN THROUGH IT HE TURNED BACK HIS SHIRT AT THE NECK AND ROLLED UP HIS SLEEVES
2004-147967-0013 I DON'T SEE HOW HE COULD DO IT GRANDMOTHER KEPT SAYING OTTO MISUNDERSTOOD HER WHY MAM IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH HE PULLED THE TRIGGER WITH HIS BIG TOE HE LAYED OVER ON HIS SIDE AND PUT THE END OF THE BARREL IN HIS MOUTH
2004-147967-0014 THEN HE DREW UP ONE FOOT AND FELT FOR THE TRIGGER HE FOUND IT ALL RIGHT
2004-147967-0015 THERE'S SOMETHING MIGHTY QUEER ABOUT IT NOW WHAT DO YOU MEAN JAKE GRANDMOTHER ASKED SHARPLY
2004-147967-0016 THEY'LL HANG ME SAYS HE MY GOD THEY'LL HANG ME SURE
2004-147967-0017 GRANDMOTHER BROKE IN EXCITEDLY
2004-147967-0018 WE'RE DEEP ENOUGH IN TROUBLE OTTO READS YOU TOO MANY OF THEM DETECTIVE STORIES
2004-147967-0019 IF HE SHOT HIMSELF IN THE WAY THEY THINK THE GASH WILL BE TORN FROM THE INSIDE OUTWARD JUST SO IT IS MISTER BURDEN OTTO AFFIRMED I SEEN BUNCHES OF HAIR AND STUFF STICKING TO THE POLES AND STRAW ALONG THE ROOF THEY WAS BLOWN UP THERE BY GUNSHOT
2004-147967-0020 NO QUESTION GRANDMOTHER TOLD GRANDFATHER SHE MEANT TO GO OVER TO THE SHIMERDAS WITH HIM THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO HE SAID DOUBTFULLY THE BODY CAN'T BE TOUCHED UNTIL WE GET THE CORONER HERE FROM BLACK HAWK AND THAT WILL BE A MATTER OF SEVERAL DAYS THIS WEATHER
2004-147967-0021 WELL I CAN TAKE THEM SOME VICTUALS ANYWAY AND SAY A WORD OF COMFORT TO THEM POOR LITTLE GIRLS THE OLDEST ONE WAS HIS DARLING AND WAS LIKE A RIGHT HAND TO HIM HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT OF HER HE'S LEFT HER ALONE IN A HARD WORLD
2004-147967-0022 SHE GLANCED DISTRUSTFULLY AT AMBROSCH WHO WAS NOW EATING HIS BREAKFAST AT THE KITCHEN TABLE
2004-147967-0023 AS HE PUT ON A SECOND PAIR OF SOCKS I'VE GOT A GOOD NOSE FOR DIRECTIONS AND I NEVER DID NEED MUCH SLEEP IT'S THE GRAY I'M WORRIED ABOUT I'LL SAVE HIM WHAT I CAN BUT IT'LL STRAIN HIM AS SURE AS I'M TELLING YOU
2004-147967-0024 THIS IS NO TIME TO BE OVER CONSIDERATE OF ANIMALS OTTO DO THE BEST YOU CAN FOR YOURSELF
2004-147967-0025 I WAS LEFT WITH AMBROSCH I SAW A SIDE OF HIM I HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE HE WAS DEEPLY EVEN SLAVISHLY DEVOUT HE DID NOT SAY A WORD ALL MORNING BUT SAT WITH HIS ROSARY IN HIS HANDS PRAYING NOW SILENTLY NOW ALOUD
2004-147967-0026 HE NEVER LOOKED AWAY FROM HIS BEADS NOR LIFTED HIS HANDS EXCEPT TO CROSS HIMSELF SEVERAL TIMES THE POOR BOY FELL ASLEEP WHERE HE SAT WAKENED WITH A START AND BEGAN TO PRAY AGAIN
2004-147967-0027 TUCKED HIS BUSHY WHITE BEARD INSIDE HIS OVERCOAT THEY LOOKED VERY BIBLICAL AS THEY SET OFF I THOUGHT JAKE AND AMBROSCH FOLLOWED THEM RIDING THE OTHER BLACK AND MY PONY CARRYING BUNDLES OF CLOTHES THAT WE HAD GOT TOGETHER FOR MISSUS SHIMERDA
2004-147967-0028 I WATCHED THEM GO PAST THE POND AND OVER THE HILL BY THE DRIFTED CORNFIELD THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME I REALIZED THAT I WAS ALONE IN THE HOUSE I FELT A CONSIDERABLE EXTENSION OF POWER AND AUTHORITY
2004-147967-0029 AND WAS ANXIOUS TO ACQUIT MYSELF CREDITABLY I CARRIED IN COBS AND WOOD FROM THE LONG CELLAR AND FILLED BOTH THE STOVES I REMEMBERED THAT IN THE HURRY AND EXCITEMENT OF THE MORNING NOBODY HAD THOUGHT OF THE CHICKENS AND THE EGGS HAD NOT BEEN GATHERED
2004-147967-0030 GOING OUT THROUGH THE TUNNEL I GAVE THE HENS THEIR CORN EMPTIED THE ICE FROM THEIR DRINKING PAN AND FILLED IT WITH WATER AFTER THE CAT HAD HAD HIS MILK I COULD THINK OF NOTHING ELSE TO DO AND I SAT DOWN TO GET WARM THE QUIET WAS DELIGHTFUL
2004-147967-0031 IT FLASHED UPON ME THAT IF MISTER SHIMERDA'S SOUL WERE LINGERING ABOUT IN THIS WORLD AT ALL IT WOULD BE HERE IN OUR HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN MORE TO HIS LIKING THAN ANY OTHER IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD I REMEMBERED HIS CONTENTED FACE WHEN HE WAS WITH US ON CHRISTMAS DAY
2004-147967-0032 IF HE COULD HAVE LIVED WITH US THIS TERRIBLE THING WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED I KNEW IT WAS HOMESICKNESS THAT HAD KILLED MISTER SHIMERDA AND I WONDERED WHETHER HIS RELEASED SPIRIT WOULD NOT EVENTUALLY FIND ITS WAY BACK TO HIS OWN COUNTRY
2004-147967-0033 I THOUGHT OF HOW FAR IT WAS TO CHICAGO AND THEN TO VIRGINIA TO BALTIMORE AND THEN THE GREAT WINTRY OCEAN NO HE WOULD NOT AT ONCE SET OUT UPON THAT LONG JOURNEY
2004-147967-0034 SURELY HIS EXHAUSTED SPIRIT SO TIRED OF COLD AND CROWDING AND THE STRUGGLE WITH THE EVER FALLING SNOW WAS RESTING NOW IN THIS QUIET HOUSE I WAS NOT FRIGHTENED BUT I MADE NO NOISE I DID NOT WISH TO DISTURB HIM
2004-147967-0035 I WENT SOFTLY DOWN TO THE KITCHEN WHICH TUCKED AWAY SO SNUGLY UNDERGROUND ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THE HEART AND CENTER OF THE HOUSE THERE ON THE BENCH BEHIND THE STOVE I THOUGHT AND THOUGHT ABOUT MISTER SHIMERDA
2004-147967-0036 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE FRIENDS HE HAD MOURNED TO LEAVE THE TROMBONE PLAYER THE GREAT FOREST FULL OF GAME BELONGING AS ANTONIA SAID TO THE NOBLES FROM WHICH SHE AND HER MOTHER USED TO STEAL WOOD ON MOONLIGHT NIGHTS
2004-147967-0037 THERE WAS A WHITE HART THAT LIVED IN THAT FOREST AND IF ANY ONE KILLED IT HE WOULD BE HANGED SHE SAID SUCH VIVID PICTURES CAME TO ME THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTER SHIMERDA'S MEMORIES NOT YET FADED OUT FROM THE AIR IN WHICH THEY HAD HAUNTED HIM
2004-147967-0038 NOBODY COULD TOUCH THE BODY UNTIL THE CORONER CAME IF ANY ONE DID SOMETHING TERRIBLE WOULD HAPPEN APPARENTLY THE DEAD MAN WAS FROZEN THROUGH JUST AS STIFF AS A DRESSED TURKEY YOU HANG OUT TO FREEZE JAKE SAID THE HORSES AND OXEN
2004-147967-0039 WOULD NOT GO INTO THE BARN UNTIL HE WAS FROZEN SO HARD THAT THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY SMELL OF BLOOD THEY WERE STABLED THERE NOW WITH THE DEAD MAN BECAUSE THERE WAS NO OTHER PLACE TO KEEP THEM A LIGHTED LANTERN WAS KEPT HANGING OVER MISTER SHIMERDA'S HEAD
2004-147967-0040 HE WAS ALWAYS COVETING DISTINCTION POOR MAREK AMBROSCH JAKE SAID SHOWED MORE HUMAN FEELING THAN HE WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED HIM CAPABLE OF BUT HE WAS CHIEFLY CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING A PRIEST AND ABOUT HIS FATHER'S SOUL
2004-147967-0041 WHICH HE BELIEVED WAS IN A PLACE OF TORMENT AND WOULD REMAIN THERE UNTIL HIS FAMILY AND THE PRIEST HAD PRAYED A GREAT DEAL FOR HIM AS I UNDERSTAND IT JAKE CONCLUDED IT WILL BE A MATTER OF YEARS TO PRAY HIS SOUL OUT OF PURGATORY AND RIGHT NOW HE'S IN TORMENT I DON'T BELIEVE IT I SAID STOUTLY
2004-147967-0042 I DID NOT OF COURSE SAY THAT I BELIEVED HE HAD BEEN IN THAT VERY KITCHEN ALL AFTERNOON ON HIS WAY BACK TO HIS OWN COUNTRY NEVERTHELESS AFTER I WENT TO BED THIS IDEA OF PUNISHMENT AND PURGATORY CAME BACK ON ME CRUSHINGLY
2004-147967-0043 I REMEMBERED THE ACCOUNT OF DIVES IN TORMENT AND SHUDDERED
