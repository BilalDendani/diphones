4172-23246-0000 CHAPTER ONE THE CREATION SIX BUSY DAYS IT TOOK IN ALL
4172-23246-0001 THE SEVENTH SOMEONE SAID TWAS GOOD AND RESTED SHOULD YOU THINK HE COULD KNOWING WHAT THE RESULT WOULD BE
4172-23246-0002 CLAIRE BEECHER KUMMER IT TAKES MUCH LONGER TO WRITE A GEOGRAPHY THAN ACCORDING TO MOSES
4172-23246-0003 IT TOOK TO CREATE THE WORLD WHICH IT IS THE GEOGRAPHER'S BUSINESS TO DESCRIBE AND SINCE THE CRITIC HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE LIST OF CREATED BEINGS IT IS NO LONGER THE FASHION FOR THE AUTHOR TO PASS JUDGMENT ON HIS OWN WORK
4172-23246-0004 LET US IMAGINE HOWEVER THAT CONCEALED IN THE CARGO OF HYPOTHETIC NEBULA DESTINED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE WAS A PROTOPLASMIC STOWAWAY
4172-23246-0005 THAT SPRANG TO BEING IN THE SHAPE OF A CRITIC JUST AS THE WORK OF CREATION WAS FINISHED WOULD IT NOT BE INTERESTING TO SPECULATE UPON THAT CRITIC'S RECEPTION OF THE FRESHLY MADE WORLD
4172-23246-0006 WE MAY BE SURE THAT HE WOULD HAVE FOUND MANY THINGS NOT TO HIS LIKING TECHNICAL DEFECTS SUCH AS THE TREATMENT OF GRASS AND FOLIAGE IN GREEN INSTEAD OF THE PROPER PURPLE
4172-23246-0007 THE TINTING OF THE SKY WHICH ANY LANDSCAPE PAINTER WILL TELL YOU WOULD BE MORE DECORATIVE DONE IN TURQUOISE GREEN THAN COBALT BLUE LIKE THE FOOLISH BUTTERFLY IN THE TALMUD WHO
4172-23246-0008 TO IMPRESS MISSUS BUTTERFLY STAMPED HIS TINY FOOT UPON THE DOME OF KING SOLOMON'S TEMPLE OUR CRITIC MIGHT HAVE DECLARED THE WORLD TOO FLIMSY IN CONSTRUCTION HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE FOUND FAULT WITH THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND THE PLUMBING
4172-23246-0009 THE ABSENCE OF HEAT IN WINTER WHEN THERE IS THE GREATER NEED OF IT AND THE PAUCITY OF MOISTURE IN THE DESERT PLACES WHERE IT NEVER RAINS THE COMICALITY OF THE APE FAMILY MIGHT HAVE PROVOKED
4172-23246-0010 AND IF HE WISHED TO BE VERY IMPRESSIVE INDEED HE WOULD PRETEND THAT HE HAD PENETRATED THE VEIL OF ANONYMITY AND HINT DARKLY THAT HE DETECTED EVIDENT TRACES OF A FEMININE TOUCH
4172-23246-0011 IN THAT HOWEVER OUR CRITIC WOULD ONLY HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATING FOR IS THERE NOT AT THIS VERY MOMENT ON THE PRESS A SUFFRAGE EDITION FOR WOMEN ONLY OF THE RUBAIYAT
4172-23246-0012 IN WHICH ONE VERSE IS AMENDED TO READ THUS THE BALL NO QUESTION MAKES OF AYES OR NUMBERS BUT RIGHT OR LEFT AS STRIKES THE PLAYER GOES AND SHE WHO TOSSED IT DOWN INTO THE FIELD SHE KNOWS ABOUT IT ALL
4172-23246-0013 SHE KNOWS SHE KNOWS PREFACE STRICTLY PRIVATE FOR THE READER ONLY DEAR READER THIS IS FOR YOU AND YOU ONLY
4172-23246-0014 WE HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE IT WOULD BE USELESS TO ATTEMPT CONCEALMENT WE HAVE THE DIGRESSION HABIT
4172-23246-0015 ALL WE ASK GENTLE READER IS THAT WHEN WE STRAY TOO FAR YOU WILL FAVOUR US WITH A GENTLE REMINDER CHAPTER TWO
4172-23246-0016 WHEN THE ACROBATIC READER HAS FETCHED HIS BREATH AND LOOKS BACK AT THE FEARSOME LIST OF GEOGRAPHERS HE HAS SKIPPED STRABO ANAXIMANDER HECATOEUS
4172-23246-0017 DEMOERITUS EUDOXUS
4172-23246-0018 POLYBIUS POSIDONIUS AND CHARLES F KING
4172-23246-0019 THE GEOGRAPHER'S TASK IS ENDLESS
4172-23246-0020 THE GLACIERS FILE AWAY THE MOUNTAINS INTO VALLEYS AND PLAINS BENEATH THE OCEAN BUSY INSECTS ARE BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONS OF NEW CONTINENTS
4172-23246-0021 UNDER THE EARTH FIERY DEMONS ARE READY AT ALL TIMES TO BURST FORTH AND HELP TO DESTROY THE OLD ONES IT REALLY BEGINS TO LOOK AS IF THIS PLANET WOULD NEVER BE FINISHED
4172-23246-0022 IN THE FIRST CHAPTER OF HIS GEOGRAPHY MOSES TELLS US THERE WERE ONLY TWO PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TODAY WE ARE PREPARING TO PUT UP THE STANDING ROOM ONLY NOTICE
4172-23246-0023 IN ANOTHER THOUSAND YEARS FOR AUGHT WE KNOW THE EARTH MAY BE GOING ROUND DARK AND TENANTLESS AND BEARING THE SIGN TO LET
4172-23246-0024 WHAT ARE WE BUT MICROSCOPIC WEEVILS IN THE MOULDY CRUST OF EARTH SUFFICIENT UNTO THE DAY IS THE WEEVIL THEREOF CHAPTER THREE THE GIDDY GLOBE
4172-23246-0025 FRANCIS BACON CALLED IT A BUBBLE SHAKESPEARE AN OYSTER ROSSETTI A MIDGE AND W S GILBERT ADDRESSES IT FAMILIARLY AS A BALL
4172-23246-0026 ROLL ON THOU BALL ROLL ON THROUGH PATHLESS REALMS OF SPACE ROLL ON WHAT THOUGH I'M IN A SORRY CASE WHAT THOUGH I CANNOT MEET MY BILLS
4172-23246-0027 WHAT THOUGH I SWALLOW COUNTLESS PILLS NEVER YOU MIND ROLL ON IT ROLLS ON BUT THESE PEOPLE BELONG TO A PRIVILEGED CLASS THAT IS ENCOURAGED EVEN PAID
4172-23246-0028 TO DISTORT THE LANGUAGE AND THEY MUST NOT BE TAKEN TOO LITERALLY THE GIDDY GLOBE IS REALLY QUITE LARGE NOT TO SAY OBESE
4172-23246-0029 HER WAIST MEASUREMENT IS NO LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MILES IN THE HOPE OF REDUCING IT THE EARTH TAKES UNCEASING AND VIOLENT EXERCISE
4172-23246-0030 BUT THOUGH SHE SPINS ROUND ON ONE TOE AT THE RATE OF A THOUSAND MILES AN HOUR EVERY DAY AND ROUND THE SUN ONCE A YEAR SHE DOES NOT SUCCEED IN TAKING OFF A SINGLE MILE
4172-23246-0031 OR KEEPING EVEN COMFORTABLY WARM ALL OVER NO WONDER THE GLOBE IS GIDDY QUESTIONS EXPLAIN THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS
