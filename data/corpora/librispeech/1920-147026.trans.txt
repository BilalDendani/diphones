1920-147026-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE SEARCH OF MILBURGH'S COTTAGE MISTER MILBURGH HAD A LITTLE HOUSE IN ONE OF THE INDUSTRIAL STREETS OF CAMDEN TOWN IT WAS A STREET MADE UP FOR THE MOST PART OF BLANK WALLS PIERCED AT INTERVALS WITH GREAT GATES
1920-147026-0001 THROUGH WHICH ONE COULD PROCURE AT TIMES A VIEW OF GAUNT FACTORIES AND SMOKY LOOKING CHIMNEY STACKS MISTER MILBURGH'S HOUSE WAS THE ONLY RESIDENCE IN THE ROAD IF ONE EXCEPTED THE QUARTERS OF CARETAKERS AND MANAGERS AND IT WAS AGREED BY ALL WHO SAW HIS TINY DEMESNE
1920-147026-0002 CANVEY COTTAGE AS IT WAS CALLED STOOD BACK FROM THE ROAD BEHIND A LAWN INNOCENT OF FLOWERS AND THE LAWN ITSELF WAS PROTECTED FROM INTRUSION BY HIGH IRON RAILINGS WHICH MISTER MILBURGH'S LANDLORD HAD HAD ERECTED AT CONSIDERABLE COST
1920-147026-0003 LOCKING AND DOUBLE LOCKING THE GATE BEHIND HIM HE WAS ALONE AND AS WAS HIS WONT HE WAS WHISTLING A SAD LITTLE REFRAIN WHICH HAD NEITHER BEGINNING NOR END HE WALKED SLOWLY UP THE STONE PATHWAY
1920-147026-0004 AND STOOD ONLY A MOMENT ON THE DOORSTEP TO SURVEY THE GROWING THICKNESS OF THE NIGHT BEFORE HE CLOSED AND BOLTED THE DOOR AND SWITCHED ON THE ELECTRIC LIGHT HE WAS IN A TINY HALLWAY PLAINLY BUT NICELY FURNISHED
1920-147026-0005 THE NOTE OF LUXURY WAS STRUCK BY THE ZOHN ETCHINGS WHICH HUNG ON THE WALL AND WHICH MISTER MILBURGH STOPPED TO REGARD APPROVINGLY HE HUNG UP HIS COAT AND HAT SLIPPED OFF THE GALOSHES HE WAS WEARING FOR IT WAS WET UNDERFOOT
1920-147026-0006 AND PASSING THROUGH A DOOR WHICH OPENED FROM THE PASSAGE CAME TO HIS LIVING ROOM THE SAME SIMPLE NOTE OF FURNITURE AND DECORATION WAS OBSERVABLE HERE THE FURNITURE WAS GOOD THE CARPET UNDER HIS FEET THICK AND LUXURIOUS
1920-147026-0007 HE SNICKED DOWN ANOTHER SWITCH AND AN ELECTRIC RADIATOR GLOWED IN THE FIREPLACE THEN HE SAT DOWN AT THE BIG TABLE
1920-147026-0008 MOST OF THEM ENCIRCLED WITH RUBBER BANDS HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO TOUCH OR READ THEM BUT SAT LOOKING MOODILY AT HIS BLOTTING PAD PREOCCUPIED AND ABSENT
1920-147026-0009 PRESENTLY HE ROSE WITH A LITTLE GRUNT AND CROSSING THE ROOM UNLOCKED A VERY COMMONPLACE AND OLD FASHIONED CUPBOARD THE TOP OF WHICH SERVED AS A SIDEBOARD FROM THE CUPBOARD HE TOOK A DOZEN LITTLE BOOKS AND CARRIED THEM TO THE TABLE
1920-147026-0010 THEY WERE OF UNIFORM SIZE AND EACH BORE THE FIGURES OF A YEAR THEY APPEARED TO BE AND INDEED WERE DIARIES BUT THEY WERE NOT MISTER MILBURGH'S DIARIES ONE DAY HE CHANCED TO GO INTO THORNTON LYNE'S ROOM AT THE STORES
1920-147026-0011 AND HAD SEEN THESE BOOKS ARRAYED ON A STEEL SHELF OF LYNE'S PRIVATE SAFE THE PROPRIETOR'S ROOM OVERLOOKED THE GROUND FLOOR OF THE STORES AND THORNTON LYNE AT THE TIME WAS VISIBLE TO HIS MANAGER AND COULD NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SURPRISE HIM

1920-147026-0014 REMOVED THOSE DIARIES TO A SAFER PLACE THEY CONTAINED A GREAT DEAL THAT WAS UNPLEASANT FOR MISTER MILBURGH PARTICULARLY THE CURRENT DIARY FOR THORNTON LYNE HAD SET DOWN NOT ONLY HIS EXPERIENCES BUT HIS DAILY HAPPENINGS HIS THOUGHTS POETICAL AND OTHERWISE
1920-147026-0015 IT WAS A PAGE EASY TO FIND BECAUSE HE HAD THRUST BETWEEN THE LEAVES A THIN ENVELOPE OF FOREIGN MAKE CONTAINING CERTAIN SLIPS OF PAPER
1920-147026-0016 AND HE FELT CAREFULLY IN HIS POCKET HE DID NOT DISCOVER THE THING FOR WHICH HE WAS SEARCHING AND WITH A SMILE HE LAID THE ENVELOPE CAREFULLY ON THE TABLE AND WENT ON AT THE POINT WHERE HIS STUDIES HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
