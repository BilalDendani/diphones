317-130243-0000 CHAPTER TWO I SPOKE OF MY LADY A LINE OR TWO BACK NOW THE DIAMOND COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IN OUR HOUSE WHERE IT WAS LOST IF IT HAD NOT BEEN MADE A PRESENT OF TO MY LADY'S DAUGHTER AND MY LADY'S DAUGHTER
317-130243-0001 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR MY LADY WHO WITH PAIN AND TRAVAIL PRODUCED HER INTO THE WORLD CONSEQUENTLY IF WE BEGIN WITH MY LADY WE ARE PRETTY SURE OF BEGINNING FAR ENOUGH BACK AND THAT LET ME TELL YOU
317-130243-0002 IS A REAL COMFORT AT STARTING IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF THE FASHIONABLE WORLD YOU HAVE HEARD TELL OF THE THREE BEAUTIFUL MISS HERNCASTLES MISS ADELAIDE MISS CAROLINE
317-130243-0003 AND I HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF JUDGING AS YOU SHALL PRESENTLY SEE
317-130243-0004 IN THIS BUSINESS OF THE DIAMOND HE HAD THE LONGEST TONGUE AND THE SHORTEST TEMPER OF ANY MAN HIGH OR LOW I EVER MET WITH I SAY I WENT INTO THE SERVICE OF THE OLD LORD AS PAGE BOY IN WAITING ON THE THREE HONOURABLE YOUNG LADIES AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN YEARS
317-130243-0005 THERE I LIVED TILL MISS JULIA MARRIED THE LATE SIR JOHN VERINDER AN EXCELLENT MAN WHO ONLY WANTED SOMEBODY TO MANAGE HIM AND BETWEEN OURSELVES HE FOUND SOMEBODY TO DO IT AND WHAT IS MORE HE THROVE ON IT AND GREW FAT ON IT AND LIVED HAPPY AND DIED EASY ON IT
317-130243-0006 TO THE DAY WHEN SHE RELIEVED HIM OF HIS LAST BREATH AND CLOSED HIS EYES FOR EVER I HAVE OMITTED TO STATE THAT I WENT WITH THE BRIDE TO THE BRIDE'S HUSBAND'S HOUSE AND LANDS DOWN HERE SIR JOHN SHE SAYS
317-130243-0007 I CAN'T DO WITHOUT GABRIEL BETTEREDGE MY LADY SAYS SIR JOHN I CAN'T DO WITHOUT HIM EITHER THAT WAS HIS WAY WITH HER AND THAT WAS HOW I WENT INTO HIS SERVICE IT WAS ALL ONE TO ME WHERE I WENT
317-130243-0008 SO LONG AS MY MISTRESS AND I WERE TOGETHER SEEING THAT MY LADY TOOK AN INTEREST IN THE OUT OF DOOR WORK AND THE FARMS AND SUCH LIKE I TOOK AN INTEREST IN THEM TOO WITH ALL THE MORE REASON THAT I WAS A SMALL FARMER'S SEVENTH SON MYSELF
317-130243-0009 MY LADY GOT ME PUT UNDER THE BAILIFF AND I DID MY BEST AND GAVE SATISFACTION AND GOT PROMOTION ACCORDINGLY SOME YEARS LATER ON THE MONDAY AS IT MIGHT BE MY LADY SAYS SIR JOHN YOUR BAILIFF IS A STUPID OLD MAN
317-130243-0010 PENSION HIM LIBERALLY AND LET GABRIEL BETTEREDGE HAVE HIS PLACE ON THE TUESDAY AS IT MIGHT BE SIR JOHN SAYS MY LADY THE BAILIFF IS PENSIONED LIBERALLY AND GABRIEL BETTEREDGE HAS GOT HIS PLACE
317-130243-0011 YOU HEAR MORE THAN ENOUGH OF MARRIED PEOPLE LIVING TOGETHER MISERABLY HERE IS AN EXAMPLE TO THE CONTRARY LET IT BE A WARNING TO SOME OF YOU AND AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO OTHERS IN THE MEANTIME I WILL GO ON WITH MY STORY WELL
317-130243-0012 THERE I WAS IN CLOVER YOU WILL SAY
317-130243-0013 WITH A LITTLE COTTAGE OF MY OWN TO LIVE IN WITH MY ROUNDS ON THE ESTATE TO OCCUPY ME IN THE MORNING AND MY ACCOUNTS IN THE AFTERNOON AND MY PIPE AND MY ROBINSON CRUSOE IN THE EVENING WHAT MORE COULD I POSSIBLY WANT TO MAKE ME HAPPY
317-130243-0014 REMEMBER WHAT ADAM WANTED WHEN HE WAS ALONE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN AND IF YOU DON'T BLAME IT IN ADAM DON'T BLAME IT IN ME THE WOMAN I FIXED MY EYE ON WAS THE WOMAN WHO KEPT HOUSE FOR ME AT MY COTTAGE HER NAME WAS SELINA GOBY
317-130243-0015 I AGREE WITH THE LATE WILLIAM COBBETT ABOUT PICKING A WIFE SEE THAT SHE CHEWS HER FOOD WELL AND SETS HER FOOT DOWN FIRMLY ON THE GROUND WHEN SHE WALKS AND YOU'RE ALL RIGHT SELINA GOBY WAS ALL RIGHT IN BOTH THESE RESPECTS
317-130243-0016 WHICH WAS ONE REASON FOR MARRYING HER I HAD ANOTHER REASON LIKEWISE ENTIRELY OF MY OWN DISCOVERING SELINA BEING A SINGLE WOMAN MADE ME PAY SO MUCH A WEEK FOR HER BOARD AND SERVICES SELINA BEING MY WIFE
317-130243-0017 COULDN'T CHARGE FOR HER BOARD AND WOULD HAVE TO GIVE ME HER SERVICES FOR NOTHING THAT WAS THE POINT OF VIEW I LOOKED AT IT FROM ECONOMY WITH A DASH OF LOVE I PUT IT TO MY MISTRESS AS IN DUTY BOUND
317-130243-0018 I SAID AND I THINK MY LADY IT WILL BE CHEAPER TO MARRY HER THAN TO KEEP HER MY LADY BURST OUT LAUGHING AND SAID SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHICH TO BE MOST SHOCKED AT MY LANGUAGE OR MY PRINCIPLES SOME JOKE TICKLED HER I SUPPOSE
317-130243-0019 UNDERSTANDING NOTHING MYSELF BUT THAT I WAS FREE TO PUT IT NEXT TO SELINA I WENT AND PUT IT ACCORDINGLY AND WHAT DID SELINA SAY
317-130243-0020 OF COURSE SHE SAID YES AS MY TIME DREW NEARER
317-130243-0021 MY MIND BEGAN TO MISGIVE ME I HAVE COMPARED NOTES WITH OTHER MEN
317-130243-0022 WHILE THEY WERE IN MY INTERESTING SITUATION AND THEY HAVE ALL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE IT HAPPENED THEY PRIVATELY WISHED THEMSELVES OUT OF IT I WENT A TRIFLE FURTHER THAN THAT MYSELF I ACTUALLY ROSE UP AS IT WERE AND TRIED TO GET OUT OF IT
317-130243-0023 NOT FOR NOTHING I WAS TOO JUST A MAN TO EXPECT SHE WOULD LET ME OFF FOR NOTHING COMPENSATION TO THE WOMAN WHEN THE MAN GETS OUT OF IT IS ONE OF THE LAWS OF ENGLAND
317-130243-0024 I OFFERED SELINA GOBY A FEATHER BED AND FIFTY SHILLINGS TO BE OFF THE BARGAIN YOU WILL HARDLY BELIEVE IT BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS TRUE
317-130243-0025 AFTER THAT IT WAS ALL OVER WITH ME OF COURSE I GOT THE NEW COAT AS CHEAP AS I COULD AND I WENT THROUGH ALL THE REST OF IT AS CHEAP AS I COULD WE WERE NOT A HAPPY COUPLE AND NOT A MISERABLE COUPLE WE WERE SIX OF ONE AND HALF A DOZEN OF THE OTHER
317-130243-0026 HOW IT WAS I DON'T UNDERSTAND BUT WE ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE
317-130243-0027 WHEN I WANTED TO GO UP STAIRS THERE WAS MY WIFE COMING DOWN
317-130243-0028 THAT IS MARRIED LIFE ACCORDING TO MY EXPERIENCE OF IT AFTER FIVE YEARS OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS ON THE STAIRS IT PLEASED AN ALL WISE PROVIDENCE TO RELIEVE US OF EACH OTHER BY TAKING MY WIFE
317-130243-0029 I WAS LEFT WITH MY LITTLE GIRL PENELOPE AND WITH NO OTHER CHILD SHORTLY AFTERWARDS SIR JOHN DIED AND MY LADY WAS LEFT WITH HER LITTLE GIRL MISS RACHEL AND NO OTHER CHILD I HAVE WRITTEN TO VERY POOR PURPOSE OF MY LADY
317-130243-0030 IF YOU REQUIRE TO BE TOLD THAT MY LITTLE PENELOPE WAS TAKEN CARE OF UNDER MY GOOD MISTRESS'S OWN EYE AND WAS SENT TO SCHOOL AND TAUGHT AND MADE A SHARP GIRL AND PROMOTED WHEN OLD ENOUGH TO BE MISS RACHEL'S OWN MAID AS FOR ME
317-130243-0031 I WENT ON WITH MY BUSINESS AS BAILIFF YEAR AFTER YEAR UP TO CHRISTMAS EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN WHEN THERE CAME A CHANGE IN MY LIFE ON THAT DAY MY LADY INVITED HERSELF TO A CUP OF TEA ALONE WITH ME IN MY COTTAGE SHE REMARKED THAT
317-130243-0032 IN THE TIME OF THE OLD LORD I HAD BEEN MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS IN HER SERVICE AND SHE PUT INTO MY HANDS A BEAUTIFUL WAISTCOAT OF WOOL THAT SHE HAD WORKED HERSELF TO KEEP ME WARM IN THE BITTER WINTER WEATHER
317-130243-0033 I RECEIVED THIS MAGNIFICENT PRESENT QUITE AT A LOSS TO FIND WORDS TO THANK MY MISTRESS WITH FOR THE HONOUR SHE HAD DONE ME
317-130243-0034 THAT THE WAISTCOAT WAS NOT AN HONOUR BUT A BRIBE MY LADY HAD DISCOVERED THAT I WAS GETTING OLD
317-130243-0035 AND SHE HAD COME TO MY COTTAGE TO WHEEDLE ME IF I MAY USE SUCH AN EXPRESSION INTO GIVING UP MY HARD OUT OF DOOR WORK AS BAILIFF AND TAKING MY EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AS STEWARD IN THE HOUSE I MADE AS GOOD A FIGHT OF IT
317-130243-0036 AGAINST THE INDIGNITY OF TAKING MY EASE AS I COULD BUT MY MISTRESS KNEW THE WEAK SIDE OF ME SHE PUT IT AS A FAVOUR TO HERSELF THE DISPUTE BETWEEN US ENDED AFTER THAT IN MY WIPING MY EYES LIKE AN OLD FOOL WITH MY NEW WOOLLEN WAISTCOAT
317-130243-0037 AND SAYING I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT THE PERTURBATION IN MY MIND IN REGARD TO THINKING ABOUT IT BEING TRULY DREADFUL AFTER MY LADY HAD GONE AWAY I APPLIED THE REMEDY WHICH I HAVE NEVER YET FOUND TO FAIL ME
317-130243-0038 IN CASES OF DOUBT AND EMERGENCY I SMOKED A PIPE AND TOOK A TURN AT ROBINSON CRUSOE
317-130243-0039 I CAME ON A COMFORTING BIT PAGE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT AS FOLLOWS
317-130243-0040 WHAT TO MORROW WE HATE I SAW MY WAY CLEAR DIRECTLY TO DAY I WAS ALL FOR CONTINUING TO BE FARM BAILIFF TO MORROW ON THE AUTHORITY OF ROBINSON CRUSOE I SHOULD BE ALL THE OTHER WAY TAKE MYSELF TO MORROW
317-130243-0041 WHILE IN TO MORROW'S HUMOUR AND THE THING WAS DONE MY MIND BEING RELIEVED IN THIS MANNER I WENT TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT IN THE CHARACTER OF LADY VERINDER'S FARM BAILIFF
317-130243-0042 IN THE CHARACTER OF LADY VERINDER'S HOUSE STEWARD ALL QUITE COMFORTABLE AND ALL THROUGH ROBINSON CRUSOE MY DAUGHTER PENELOPE HAS JUST LOOKED OVER MY SHOULDER TO SEE WHAT I HAVE DONE SO FAR
317-130243-0043 EVERY WORD OF IT TRUE BUT SHE POINTS OUT ONE OBJECTION SHE SAYS WHAT I HAVE DONE SO FAR ISN'T IN THE LEAST WHAT I WAS WANTED TO DO
317-130243-0044 INSTEAD OF THAT I HAVE BEEN TELLING THE STORY OF MY OWN SELF CURIOUS AND QUITE BEYOND ME TO ACCOUNT FOR
317-130243-0045 EVER FIND THEIR OWN SELVES GETTING IN THE WAY OF THEIR SUBJECTS LIKE ME IF THEY DO I CAN FEEL FOR THEM IN THE MEANTIME HERE IS ANOTHER FALSE START AND MORE WASTE OF GOOD WRITING PAPER WHAT'S TO BE DONE NOW
