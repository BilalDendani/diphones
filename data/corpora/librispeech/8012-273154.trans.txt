8012-273154-0000 AND WHAT ARE YOUR EYES POPPING OUT OF YOUR HEAD ABOUT NOW ASKED MARILLA WHEN ANNE HAD JUST COME IN FROM A RUN TO THE POST OFFICE HAVE YOU DISCOVERED ANOTHER KINDRED SPIRIT EXCITEMENT HUNG AROUND ANNE LIKE A GARMENT
8012-273154-0001 KINDLED IN EVERY FEATURE SHE HAD COME DANCING UP THE LANE LIKE A WIND BLOWN SPRITE THROUGH THE MELLOW SUNSHINE AND LAZY SHADOWS OF THE AUGUST EVENING NO MARILLA BUT OH WHAT DO YOU THINK

8012-273154-0004 SAID MARILLA REGARDING THE WONDERFUL EVENT VERY COOLLY YOU NEEDN'T GET IN SUCH A FEVER OVER IT DO LEARN TO TAKE THINGS CALMLY CHILD FOR ANNE TO TAKE THINGS CALMLY
8012-273154-0005 AS SHE WAS THE PLEASURES AND PAINS OF LIFE CAME TO HER WITH TREBLED INTENSITY MARILLA FELT THIS AND WAS VAGUELY TROUBLED OVER IT REALIZING THAT THE UPS AND DOWNS OF EXISTENCE WOULD PROBABLY BEAR HARDLY
8012-273154-0006 ON THIS IMPULSIVE SOUL AND NOT SUFFICIENTLY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE EQUALLY GREAT CAPACITY FOR DELIGHT MIGHT MORE THAN COMPENSATE THEREFORE MARILLA CONCEIVED IT TO BE HER DUTY TO DRILL ANNE
8012-273154-0007 SHE DID NOT MAKE MUCH HEADWAY AS SHE SORROWFULLY ADMITTED TO HERSELF THE DOWNFALL OF SOME DEAR HOPE OR PLAN PLUNGED ANNE INTO DEEPS OF AFFLICTION THE FULFILLMENT
8012-273154-0008 THEREOF EXALTED HER TO DIZZY REALMS OF DELIGHT MARILLA HAD ALMOST BEGUN TO DESPAIR OF EVER FASHIONING THIS WAIF OF THE WORLD INTO HER MODEL LITTLE GIRL OF DEMURE MANNERS AND PRIM DEPORTMENT
8012-273154-0009 NEITHER WOULD SHE HAVE BELIEVED THAT SHE REALLY LIKED ANNE MUCH BETTER AS SHE WAS ANNE WENT TO BED THAT NIGHT SPEECHLESS WITH MISERY BECAUSE MATTHEW HAD SAID THE WIND WAS ROUND NORTHEAST AND HE FEARED IT WOULD BE A RAINY DAY TOMORROW
8012-273154-0010 THE RUSTLE OF THE POPLAR LEAVES ABOUT THE HOUSE WORRIED HER IT SOUNDED SO LIKE PATTERING RAINDROPS AND THE FULL FARAWAY ROAR OF THE GULF TO WHICH SHE LISTENED DELIGHTEDLY
8012-273154-0011 AT OTHER TIMES LOVING ITS STRANGE SONOROUS HAUNTING RHYTHM NOW SEEMED LIKE A PROPHECY OF STORM AND DISASTER TO A SMALL MAIDEN WHO PARTICULARLY WANTED A FINE DAY
8012-273154-0012 ANNE THOUGHT THAT THE MORNING WOULD NEVER COME BUT ALL THINGS HAVE AN END EVEN NIGHTS BEFORE THE DAY ON WHICH YOU ARE INVITED TO TAKE TEA AT THE MANSE THE MORNING
8012-273154-0013 IN SPITE OF MATTHEW'S PREDICTIONS WAS FINE AND ANNE'S SPIRITS SOARED TO THEIR HIGHEST OH MARILLA THERE IS SOMETHING IN ME TODAY THAT MAKES ME JUST LOVE EVERYBODY I SEE SHE EXCLAIMED
8012-273154-0014 AS SHE WASHED THE BREAKFAST DISHES YOU DON'T KNOW HOW GOOD I FEEL WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF IT COULD LAST I BELIEVE I COULD BE A MODEL CHILD IF I WERE JUST INVITED OUT TO TEA EVERY DAY
8012-273154-0015 BUT OH MARILLA IT'S A SOLEMN OCCASION TOO I FEEL SO ANXIOUS WHAT IF I SHOULDN'T BEHAVE PROPERLY YOU KNOW I NEVER HAD TEA AT A MANSE BEFORE
8012-273154-0016 AND I'M NOT SURE THAT I KNOW ALL THE RULES OF ETIQUETTE ALTHOUGH I'VE BEEN STUDYING THE RULES GIVEN IN THE ETIQUETTE DEPARTMENT OF THE FAMILY HERALD EVER SINCE I CAME HERE I'M SO AFRAID I'LL DO SOMETHING SILLY
8012-273154-0017 IS THAT YOU'RE THINKING TOO MUCH ABOUT YOURSELF YOU SHOULD JUST THINK OF MISSUS ALLAN AND WHAT WOULD BE NICEST AND MOST AGREEABLE TO HER SAID MARILLA HITTING FOR ONCE IN HER LIFE ON A VERY SOUND AND PITHY PIECE OF ADVICE
8012-273154-0018 ANNE INSTANTLY REALIZED THIS YOU ARE RIGHT MARILLA
8012-273154-0019 ANNE EVIDENTLY GOT THROUGH HER VISIT WITHOUT ANY SERIOUS BREACH OF ETIQUETTE FOR SHE CAME HOME THROUGH THE TWILIGHT UNDER A GREAT HIGH SPRUNG SKY GLORIED OVER WITH TRAILS OF SAFFRON AND ROSY CLOUD
8012-273154-0020 IN A BEATIFIED STATE OF MIND AND TOLD MARILLA ALL ABOUT IT HAPPILY SITTING ON THE BIG RED SANDSTONE SLAB AT THE KITCHEN DOOR WITH HER TIRED CURLY HEAD IN MARILLA'S GINGHAM LAP
8012-273154-0021 A COOL WIND WAS BLOWING DOWN OVER THE LONG HARVEST FIELDS FROM THE RIMS OF FIRRY WESTERN HILLS AND WHISTLING THROUGH THE POPLARS ONE CLEAR STAR
8012-273154-0022 IN AND OUT AMONG THE FERNS AND RUSTLING BOUGHS
8012-273154-0023 AS SHE TALKED AND SOMEHOW FELT THAT WIND AND STARS AND FIREFLIES WERE ALL TANGLED UP TOGETHER INTO SOMETHING UNUTTERABLY SWEET AND ENCHANTING OH MARILLA
8012-273154-0024 I'VE HAD A MOST FASCINATING TIME I FEEL THAT I HAVE NOT LIVED IN VAIN AND I SHALL ALWAYS FEEL LIKE THAT EVEN IF I SHOULD NEVER BE INVITED TO TEA AT A MANSE AGAIN
8012-273154-0025 WHEN I GOT THERE MISSUS ALLAN MET ME AT THE DOOR SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE SWEETEST DRESS OF PALE PINK ORGANDY WITH DOZENS OF FRILLS AND ELBOW SLEEVES
8012-273154-0026 AND SHE LOOKED JUST LIKE A SERAPH I REALLY THINK I'D LIKE TO BE A MINISTER'S WIFE WHEN I GROW UP MARILLA A MINISTER MIGHTN'T MIND MY RED HAIR BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T BE THINKING OF SUCH WORLDLY THINGS
8012-273154-0027 BUT THEN OF COURSE ONE WOULD HAVE TO BE NATURALLY GOOD AND I'LL NEVER BE THAT SO I SUPPOSE THERE'S NO USE IN THINKING ABOUT IT SOME PEOPLE ARE NATURALLY GOOD YOU KNOW AND OTHERS ARE NOT
8012-273154-0028 I'M ONE OF THE OTHERS MISSUS LYNDE SAYS I'M FULL OF ORIGINAL SIN NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY TO BE GOOD I CAN NEVER MAKE SUCH A SUCCESS OF IT AS THOSE WHO ARE NATURALLY GOOD IT'S A GOOD DEAL LIKE GEOMETRY I EXPECT
8012-273154-0029 OUGHT TO COUNT FOR SOMETHING MISSUS ALLAN IS ONE OF THE NATURALLY GOOD PEOPLE I LOVE HER PASSIONATELY YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE LIKE MATTHEW AND MISSUS ALLAN THAT YOU CAN LOVE RIGHT OFF WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE
8012-273154-0030 AND THERE ARE OTHERS LIKE MISSUS LYNDE THAT YOU HAVE TO TRY VERY HARD TO LOVE YOU KNOW YOU OUGHT TO LOVE THEM
8012-273154-0031 FROM THE WHITE SANDS SUNDAY SCHOOL HER NAME WAS LAURETTE BRADLEY
8012-273154-0032 AFTER TEA MISSUS ALLAN PLAYED AND SANG AND SHE GOT LAURETTA AND ME TO SING TOO MISSUS ALLAN SAYS I HAVE A GOOD VOICE AND SHE SAYS I MUST SING IN THE SUNDAY SCHOOL CHOIR AFTER THIS YOU CAN'T THINK
8012-273154-0033 HOW I WAS THRILLED AT THE MERE THOUGHT I'VE LONGED SO TO SING IN THE SUNDAY SCHOOL CHOIR AS DIANA DOES BUT I FEARED IT WAS AN HONOR I COULD NEVER ASPIRE TO LAURETTA HAD TO GO HOME EARLY

8012-273154-0038 AND COMING TO GREEN GABLES AND MY TROUBLES OVER GEOMETRY AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT MARILLA MISSUS ALLAN TOLD ME SHE WAS A DUNCE AT GEOMETRY TOO
8012-273154-0039 THE TRUSTEES HAVE HIRED A NEW TEACHER AND IT'S A LADY HER NAME IS MISS MURIEL STACY ISN'T THAT A ROMANTIC NAME MISSUS LYNDE SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD A FEMALE TEACHER IN AVONLEA BEFORE
8012-273154-0040 BUT I THINK IT WILL BE SPLENDID TO HAVE A LADY TEACHER
