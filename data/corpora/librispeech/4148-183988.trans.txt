4148-183988-0000 AT DINNER THAT EVENING MADAME DE CHANTELLE'S SLENDER MONOLOGUE WAS THROWN OUT OVER GULFS OF SILENCE OWEN WAS STILL IN THE SAME STATE OF MOODY ABSTRACTION AS WHEN DARROW HAD LEFT HIM AT THE PIANO AND EVEN ANNA'S FACE TO HER FRIEND'S VIGILANT EYE
4148-183988-0001 REVEALED NOT PERHAPS A PERSONAL PREOCCUPATION BUT A VAGUE SENSE OF IMPENDING DISTURBANCE SHE SMILED SHE BORE A PART IN THE TALK HER EYES DWELT ON DARROW'S WITH THEIR USUAL DEEP RELIANCE
4148-183988-0002 BUT BENEATH THE SURFACE OF HER SERENITY HIS TENSE PERCEPTIONS DETECTED A HIDDEN STIR HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY SELF POSSESSED TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IT WAS DOUBTLESS DUE TO CAUSES WITH WHICH HE WAS NOT DIRECTLY CONCERNED
4148-183988-0003 FOR A MOMENT IT OCCURRED TO DARROW THAT ANNA MIGHT HAVE EMPLOYED HER AFTERNOON IN PREPARING MADAME DE CHANTELLE FOR HER GRANDSON'S IMPENDING ANNOUNCEMENT BUT A GLANCE AT THE ELDER LADY'S UNCLOUDED BROW SHOWED THAT HE MUST SEEK ELSEWHERE THE CLUE TO OWEN'S TACITURNITY
4148-183988-0004 AND HIS STEP MOTHER'S CONCERN POSSIBLY ANNA HAD FOUND REASON TO CHANGE HER OWN ATTITUDE IN THE MATTER AND HAD MADE THE CHANGE KNOWN TO OWEN BUT THIS AGAIN WAS NEGATIVED BY THE FACT THAT DURING THE AFTERNOON'S SHOOTING
4148-183988-0005 THIS OBSCURED IF IT NARROWED THE FIELD OF CONJECTURE AND DARROW'S GROPINGS THREW HIM BACK ON THE CONCLUSION THAT HE WAS PROBABLY READING TOO MUCH SIGNIFICANCE INTO THE MOODS OF A LAD HE HARDLY KNEW
4148-183988-0006 AND WHO HAD BEEN DESCRIBED TO HIM AS SUBJECT TO SUDDEN CHANGES OF HUMOUR AS TO ANNA'S FANCIED PERTURBATION IT MIGHT SIMPLY BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT SHE HAD DECIDED TO PLEAD OWEN'S CAUSE THE NEXT DAY AND HAD PERHAPS ALREADY HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES AWAITING HER
4148-183988-0007 SUCH AT ANY RATE WAS THE CONCLUSION HE HAD REACHED WHEN SHORTLY AFTER THE TWO LADIES LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM HE BADE OWEN GOOD NIGHT AND WENT UP TO HIS ROOM
4148-183988-0008 EVER SINCE THE RAPID SELF COLLOQUY WHICH HAD FOLLOWED ON HIS FIRST SIGHT OF SOPHY VINER HE HAD KNOWN THERE WERE OTHER QUESTIONS TO BE FACED BEHIND THE ONE IMMEDIATELY CONFRONTING HIM ON THE SCORE OF THAT ONE AT LEAST HIS MIND IF NOT EASY WAS RELIEVED
4148-183988-0009 HE HAD DONE WHAT WAS POSSIBLE TO REASSURE THE GIRL AND SHE HAD APPARENTLY RECOGNIZED THE SINCERITY OF HIS INTENTION HE HAD PATCHED UP AS DECENT A CONCLUSION AS HE COULD TO AN INCIDENT THAT SHOULD OBVIOUSLY HAVE HAD NO SEQUEL
4148-183988-0010 BUT HE HAD KNOWN ALL ALONG THAT WITH THE SECURING OF MISS VINER'S PEACE OF MIND ONLY A PART OF HIS OBLIGATION WAS DISCHARGED AND THAT WITH THAT PART HIS REMAINING DUTY WAS IN CONFLICT IT HAD BEEN HIS FIRST BUSINESS TO CONVINCE THE GIRL
4148-183988-0011 HIS OWN IDEAS ABOUT SOPHY VINER WERE TOO MIXED AND INDETERMINATE FOR HIM NOT TO FEEL THE RISK OF SUCH AN EXPERIMENT YET HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE INTOLERABLE POSITION OF APPEARING TO PRESS IT ON THE WOMAN HE DESIRED ABOVE ALL OTHERS TO PROTECT
4148-183988-0012 TILL LATE IN THE NIGHT HIS THOUGHTS REVOLVED IN A TURMOIL OF INDECISION HIS PRIDE WAS HUMBLED BY THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN WHAT SOPHY VINER HAD BEEN TO HIM AND WHAT HE HAD THOUGHT OF HER THIS DISCREPANCY
4148-183988-0013 WHICH AT THE TIME HAD SEEMED TO SIMPLIFY THE INCIDENT NOW TURNED OUT TO BE ITS MOST GALLING COMPLICATION THE BARE TRUTH INDEED WAS THAT HE HAD HARDLY THOUGHT OF HER AT ALL EITHER AT THE TIME OR SINCE AND THAT HE WAS ASHAMED TO BASE HIS JUDGEMENT OF HER
4148-183988-0014 ON HIS MEAGRE MEMORY OF THEIR ADVENTURE THE ESSENTIAL CHEAPNESS OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR AS FAR AS HIS SHARE IN IT WAS CONCERNED CAME HOME TO HIM WITH HUMILIATING DISTINCTNESS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO BE ABLE TO FEEL THAT AT THE TIME AT LEAST
4148-183988-0015 HE HAD STAKED SOMETHING MORE ON IT AND HAD SOMEHOW IN THE SEQUEL HAD A MORE PALPABLE LOSS TO SHOW BUT THE PLAIN FACT WAS THAT HE HADN'T SPENT A PENNY ON IT WHICH WAS NO DOUBT THE REASON OF THE PRODIGIOUS SCORE IT HAD SINCE BEEN ROLLING UP
4148-183988-0016 AT ANY RATE BEAT ABOUT THE CASE AS HE WOULD IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE OWED IT TO ANNA AND INCIDENTALLY TO HIS OWN PEACE OF MIND TO FIND SOME WAY OF SECURING SOPHY VINER'S FUTURE
4148-183988-0017 WHEN HE AND HIS WIFE SHOULD DEPART FOR THEIR NEW POST THE NIGHT BROUGHT NO AID TO THE SOLVING OF THIS PROBLEM BUT IT GAVE HIM AT ANY RATE THE CLEAR CONVICTION THAT NO TIME WAS TO BE LOST HIS FIRST STEP MUST BE TO OBTAIN FROM MISS VINER
4148-183988-0018 THE CHANCE OF ANOTHER AND CALMER TALK AND HE RESOLVED TO SEEK IT AT THE EARLIEST HOUR HE HAD GATHERED THAT EFFIE'S LESSONS WERE PRECEDED BY AN EARLY SCAMPER IN THE PARK
4148-183988-0019 AND CONJECTURING THAT HER GOVERNESS MIGHT BE WITH HER HE BETOOK HIMSELF THE NEXT MORNING TO THE TERRACE WHENCE HE WANDERED ON TO THE GARDENS AND THE WALKS BEYOND THE ATMOSPHERE WAS STILL AND PALE
4148-183988-0020 THE MUFFLED SUNLIGHT GLEAMED LIKE GOLD TISSUE THROUGH GREY GAUZE AND THE BEECH ALLEYS TAPERED AWAY TO A BLUE HAZE BLENT OF SKY AND FOREST
4148-183988-0021 IT WAS ONE OF THOSE ELUSIVE DAYS WHEN THE FAMILIAR FORMS OF THINGS SEEM ABOUT TO DISSOLVE IN A PRISMATIC SHIMMER THE STILLNESS WAS PRESENTLY BROKEN BY JOYFUL BARKS AND DARROW TRACKING THE SOUND
4148-183988-0022 OVERTOOK EFFIE FLYING DOWN ONE OF THE LONG ALLEYS AT THE HEAD OF HER PACK BEYOND HER HE SAW MISS VINER SEATED NEAR THE STONE RIMMED BASIN BESIDE WHICH HE AND ANNA HAD PAUSED ON THEIR FIRST WALK TO THE RIVER THE GIRL COMING FORWARD AT HIS APPROACH
4148-183988-0023 RETURNED HIS GREETING ALMOST GAILY HIS FIRST GLANCE SHOWED HIM THAT SHE HAD REGAINED HER COMPOSURE AND THE CHANGE IN HER APPEARANCE GAVE HIM THE MEASURE OF HER FEARS FOR THE FIRST TIME HE SAW IN HER AGAIN THE SIDELONG GRACE THAT HAD CHARMED HIS EYES IN PARIS
4148-183988-0024 BUT IT'S BARELY TEN MINUTES PAST LET'S AT LEAST WALK A LITTLE WAY TOWARD THE RIVER SHE GLANCED DOWN THE LONG WALK AHEAD OF THEM AND THEN BACK IN THE DIRECTION OF THE HOUSE IF YOU LIKE
4148-183988-0025 BUT INSTEAD OF TAKING THE WAY HE PROPOSED SHE TURNED TOWARD A NARROW PATH WHICH BRANCHED OFF OBLIQUELY THROUGH THE TREES DARROW WAS STRUCK AND VAGUELY TROUBLED BY THE CHANGE IN HER LOOK AND TONE
4148-183988-0026 THERE WAS IN THEM AN UNDEFINABLE APPEAL WHETHER FOR HELP OR FORBEARANCE HE COULD NOT TELL THEN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING MISLEADING IN HIS SO POINTEDLY SEEKING HER AND HE FELT A MOMENTARY CONSTRAINT
4148-183988-0027 TO EASE IT HE MADE AN ABRUPT DASH AT THE TRUTH I CAME OUT TO LOOK FOR YOU BECAUSE OUR TALK OF YESTERDAY WAS SO UNSATISFACTORY I WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT YOU ABOUT YOUR PLANS AND PROSPECTS
4148-183988-0028 HIS GLANCE STRAYED DOWN THE GOLD ROOFED WINDINGS AHEAD OF THEM IT'S DELIGHTFUL YOU COULDN'T BE BETTER PLACED ONLY I WONDER A LITTLE AT YOUR HAVING SO COMPLETELY GIVEN UP ANY IDEA OF A DIFFERENT FUTURE
4148-183988-0029 YET SOMEHOW I DON'T SEEM TO SEE YOU PERMANENTLY GIVEN UP TO FORMING THE YOUNG WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU SEEM TO SEE ME PERMANENTLY GIVEN UP TO YOU KNOW YOU WARNED ME RATHER EMPHATICALLY AGAINST THE THEATRE
4148-183988-0030 SHE THREW OFF THE STATEMENT WITHOUT IMPATIENCE AS THOUGH THEY WERE DISCUSSING TOGETHER THE FATE OF A THIRD PERSON IN WHOM BOTH WERE BENEVOLENTLY INTERESTED DARROW CONSIDERED HIS REPLY IF I DID
4148-183988-0031 IT WAS BECAUSE YOU SO EMPHATICALLY REFUSED TO LET ME HELP YOU TO A START SHE STOPPED SHORT AND FACED HIM AND YOU THINK I MAY LET YOU NOW DARROW FELT THE BLOOD IN HIS CHEEK HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HER ATTITUDE
4148-183988-0032 IF I'D EVER CARED A STRAW FOR HER I SHOULD KNOW HOW TO AVOID HURTING HER NOW AND HIS INSENSIBILITY STRUCK HIM AS NO BETTER THAN A VULGAR OBTUSENESS BUT HE HAD A FIXED PURPOSE AHEAD AND COULD ONLY PUSH ON TO IT
4148-183988-0033 I HOPE AT ANY RATE YOU'LL LISTEN TO MY REASONS THERE'S BEEN TIME ON BOTH SIDES TO THINK THEM OVER SINCE HE CAUGHT HIMSELF BACK AND HUNG HELPLESS ON THE SINCE
4148-183988-0034 WHATEVER WORDS HE CHOSE HE SEEMED TO STUMBLE AMONG REMINDERS OF THEIR PAST SHE WALKED ON BESIDE HIM HER EYES ON THE GROUND THEN I'M TO UNDERSTAND DEFINITELY THAT YOU DO RENEW YOUR OFFER SHE ASKED
4148-183988-0035 WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU'LL ONLY LET ME SHE RAISED A HAND AS THOUGH TO CHECK HIM IT'S EXTREMELY FRIENDLY OF YOU I DO BELIEVE YOU MEAN IT AS A FRIEND BUT I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY FINDING ME AS YOU SAY
4148-183988-0036 SO WELL PLACED HERE YOU SHOULD SHOW MORE ANXIETY ABOUT MY FUTURE THAN AT A TIME WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY AND RATHER DESPERATELY ADRIFT OH NO NOT MORE IF YOU SHOW ANY AT ALL IT MUST AT ANY RATE BE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS
4148-183988-0037 IN FACT IT CAN ONLY BE SHE WENT ON WITH ONE OF HER DISCONCERTING FLASHES OF ASTUTENESS FOR ONE OF TWO REASONS EITHER BECAUSE YOU FEEL YOU OUGHT TO HELP ME OR BECAUSE FOR SOME REASON YOU THINK YOU OWE IT TO MISSUS LEATH TO LET HER KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW OF ME
4148-183988-0038 DARROW STOOD STILL IN THE PATH BEHIND HIM HE HEARD EFFIE'S CALL AND AT THE CHILD'S VOICE HE SAW SOPHY TURN HER HEAD WITH THE ALERTNESS OF ONE WHO IS OBSCURELY ON THE WATCH
4148-183988-0039 THE LOOK WAS SO FUGITIVE THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE SAID WHEREIN IT DIFFERED FROM HER NORMAL PROFESSIONAL AIR OF HAVING HER PUPIL ON HER MIND EFFIE SPRANG PAST THEM AND DARROW TOOK UP THE GIRL'S CHALLENGE
4148-183988-0040 BUT THE WISH ISN'T DUE TO TO ANY PAST KINDNESS ON YOUR PART BUT SIMPLY TO MY OWN INTEREST IN YOU WHY NOT PUT IT THAT OUR FRIENDSHIP GIVES ME THE RIGHT TO INTERVENE FOR WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE YOUR BENEFIT
4148-183988-0041 SHE TOOK A FEW HESITATING STEPS AND THEN PAUSED AGAIN DARROW NOTICED THAT SHE HAD GROWN PALE AND THAT THERE WERE RINGS OF SHADE ABOUT HER EYES YOU'VE KNOWN MISSUS LEATH A LONG TIME SHE ASKED HIM SUDDENLY
4148-183988-0042 THEN YOU MIGHT NATURALLY FEEL YOURSELF JUSTIFIED IN TELLING HER THAT YOU DON'T THINK I'M THE RIGHT PERSON FOR EFFIE HE UTTERED A SOUND OF PROTEST BUT SHE DISREGARDED IT I DON'T SAY YOU'D LIKE TO DO IT YOU WOULDN'T YOU'D HATE IT
4148-183988-0043 AND THE NATURAL ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO TRY TO PERSUADE ME THAT I'D BE BETTER OFF SOMEWHERE ELSE THAN HERE BUT SUPPOSING THAT FAILED AND YOU SAW I WAS DETERMINED TO STAY THEN YOU MIGHT THINK IT YOUR DUTY TO TELL MISSUS LEATH
4148-183988-0044 SHE LAID THE CASE BEFORE HIM WITH A COLD LUCIDITY I SHOULD IN YOUR PLACE I BELIEVE SHE ENDED WITH A LITTLE LAUGH I SHOULDN'T FEEL JUSTIFIED IN TELLING HER BEHIND YOUR BACK IF I THOUGHT YOU UNSUITED FOR THE PLACE
4148-183988-0045 BUT I SHOULD CERTAINLY FEEL JUSTIFIED HE REJOINED AFTER A PAUSE IN TELLING YOU IF I THOUGHT THE PLACE UNSUITED TO YOU AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME NOW YES BUT NOT FOR THE REASONS YOU IMAGINE
4148-183988-0046 WHAT THEN ARE YOUR REASONS IF YOU PLEASE I'VE ALREADY IMPLIED THEM IN ADVISING YOU NOT TO GIVE UP ALL IDEA OF THE THEATRE YOU'RE TOO VARIOUS TOO GIFTED TOO PERSONAL TO TIE YOURSELF DOWN AT YOUR AGE
4148-183988-0047 TO THE DISMAL DRUDGERY OF TEACHING AND IS THAT WHAT YOU'VE TOLD MISSUS LEATH SHE RUSHED THE QUESTION OUT AT HIM AS IF SHE EXPECTED TO TRIP HIM UP OVER IT HE WAS MOVED BY THE SIMPLICITY OF THE STRATAGEM
4148-183988-0048 I'VE TOLD HER EXACTLY NOTHING HE REPLIED AND WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU MEAN BY NOTHING YOU AND SHE WERE TALKING ABOUT ME WHEN I CAME INTO HER SITTING ROOM YESTERDAY DARROW FELT HIS BLOOD RISE AT THE THRUST
4148-183988-0049 AND NOT THAT YOU'VE EVER SEEN ME SINCE AND NOT THAT I'VE EVER SEEN YOU SINCE AND SHE BELIEVES YOU SHE COMPLETELY BELIEVES YOU HE UTTERED A PROTESTING EXCLAMATION AND HIS FLUSH REFLECTED ITSELF IN THE GIRL'S CHEEK
4148-183988-0050 OH I BEG YOUR PARDON I DIDN'T MEAN TO ASK YOU THAT SHE HALTED AND AGAIN CAST A RAPID GLANCE BEHIND AND AHEAD OF HER THEN SHE HELD OUT HER HAND WELL THEN THANK YOU AND LET ME RELIEVE YOUR FEARS
4148-183988-0051 I SHA'N'T BE EFFIE'S GOVERNESS MUCH LONGER AT THE ANNOUNCEMENT DARROW TRIED TO MERGE HIS LOOK OF RELIEF INTO THE EXPRESSION OF FRIENDLY INTEREST WITH WHICH HE GRASPED HER HAND YOU REALLY DO AGREE WITH ME THEN
4148-183988-0052 AND YOU'LL GIVE ME A CHANCE TO TALK THINGS OVER WITH YOU SHE SHOOK HER HEAD WITH A FAINT SMILE I'M NOT THINKING OF THE STAGE I'VE HAD ANOTHER OFFER THAT'S ALL THE RELIEF WAS HARDLY LESS GREAT
4148-183988-0053 YOU'LL TELL ME ABOUT THAT THEN WON'T YOU HER SMILE FLICKERED UP OH YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT IT SOON I MUST CATCH EFFIE NOW AND DRAG HER BACK TO THE BLACKBOARD
4148-183988-0054 SHE WALKED ON FOR A FEW YARDS AND THEN PAUSED AGAIN AND CONFRONTED HIM I'VE BEEN ODIOUS TO YOU AND NOT QUITE HONEST SHE BROKE OUT SUDDENLY NOT QUITE HONEST HE REPEATED CAUGHT IN A FRESH WAVE OF WONDER
4148-183988-0055 FOR THE SAME SPACE OF TIME THE PAST SURGED UP IN HIM CONFUSEDLY THEN A VEIL DROPPED BETWEEN THEM HERE'S EFFIE NOW SHE EXCLAIMED HE TURNED AND SAW THE LITTLE GIRL TROTTING BACK TO THEM HER HAND IN OWEN LEATH'S
4148-183988-0056 FOR A MOMENT SOPHY VINER'S CHEEKS BURNED REDDER THEN THEY FADED TO THE PALENESS OF WHITE PETALS SHE LOST HOWEVER NOTHING OF THE BRIGHT BRAVERY WHICH IT WAS HER WAY TO TURN ON THE UNEXPECTED
4148-183988-0057 BUT HER OBSERVER WAS LESS STRUCK BY THIS THAN BY THE CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN OWEN LEATH THE LATTER WHEN HE CAME IN SIGHT HAD BEEN LAUGHING AND TALKING UNCONCERNEDLY WITH EFFIE
4148-183988-0058 BUT AS HIS EYE FELL ON MISS VINER HIS EXPRESSION ALTERED AS SUDDENLY AS HERS THE CHANGE FOR DARROW WAS LESS DEFINABLE BUT PERHAPS FOR THAT REASON IT STRUCK HIM AS MORE SHARPLY SIGNIFICANT
4148-183988-0059 ONLY JUST WHAT DID IT SIGNIFY OWEN LIKE SOPHY VINER HAD THE KIND OF FACE WHICH SEEMS LESS THE STAGE ON WHICH EMOTIONS MOVE THAN THE VERY STUFF THEY WORK IN
4148-183988-0060 IN MOMENTS OF EXCITEMENT HIS ODD IRREGULAR FEATURES SEEMED TO GROW FLUID TO UNMAKE AND REMAKE THEMSELVES LIKE THE SHADOWS OF CLOUDS ON A STREAM DARROW THROUGH THE RAPID FLIGHT OF THE SHADOWS COULD NOT SEIZE ON ANY SPECIFIC INDICATION OF FEELING
4148-183988-0061 HE MERELY PERCEIVED THAT THE YOUNG MAN WAS UNACCOUNTABLY SURPRISED AT FINDING HIM WITH MISS VINER AND THAT THE EXTENT OF HIS SURPRISE MIGHT COVER ALL MANNER OF IMPLICATIONS DARROW'S FIRST IDEA WAS THAT OWEN
4148-183988-0062 IF HE SUSPECTED THAT THE CONVERSATION WAS NOT THE RESULT OF AN ACCIDENTAL ENCOUNTER MIGHT WONDER AT HIS STEP MOTHER'S SUITOR BEING ENGAGED AT SUCH AN HOUR IN PRIVATE TALK WITH HER LITTLE GIRL'S GOVERNESS
4148-183988-0063 AND HE WALKED ON IN SILENCE AT MISS VINER'S SIDE PRESENTLY HE WAS STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT OWEN LEATH AND THE GIRL WERE SILENT ALSO AND THIS GAVE A NEW TURN TO HIS THOUGHTS SILENCE MAY BE AS VARIOUSLY SHADED AS SPEECH
4148-183988-0064 AND THAT WHICH ENFOLDED DARROW AND HIS TWO COMPANIONS SEEMED TO HIS WATCHFUL PERCEPTIONS TO BE QUIVERING WITH CROSS THREADS OF COMMUNICATION AT FIRST HE WAS AWARE ONLY OF THOSE THAT CENTRED IN HIS OWN TROUBLED CONSCIOUSNESS
4148-183988-0065 THEN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT AN EQUAL ACTIVITY OF INTERCOURSE WAS GOING ON OUTSIDE OF IT SOMETHING WAS IN FACT PASSING MUTELY AND RAPIDLY BETWEEN YOUNG LEATH AND SOPHY VINER
