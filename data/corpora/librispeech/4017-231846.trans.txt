4017-231846-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE HOUSE IN JERSEY STREET AS HER LISTENERS MADE NO COMMENT ON MISS TYLER'S ACCUSATION OF MISSUS VRAIN SHE PAUSED ONLY FOR A MOMENT TO RECOVER HER BREATH AND WAS OFF AGAIN IN FULL CRY
4017-231846-0001 WITH A BUDGET OF ANCIENT GOSSIP DRAWN FROM A VERY RETENTIVE MEMORY OF THE WAY IN WHICH LYDIA TREATED HER POOR DEAR HUSBAND I KNOW LITTLE CRIED THE FAIR BELLA ONLY THIS THAT SHE DROVE HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE BY HER SCANDALOUS CONDUCT YES INDEED
4017-231846-0002 ALTHOUGH YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE ME DI YOU WERE AWAY IN AUSTRALIA AT THE TIME BUT I KEPT A WATCH ON LYDIA IN YOUR INTEREST DEAR AND OUR HOUSEMAID HEARD FROM YOUR HOUSEMAID THE MOST DREADFUL THINGS WHY MISTER VRAIN REMONSTRATED WITH LYDIA

4017-231846-0004 BUT HE WAS WEAK IN THE HEAD POOR MAN AND I SUPPOSE LET THINGS GO ON WHEN NEXT I HEARD OF HIM HE WAS A CORPSE IN GENEVA SQUARE BUT DID MY FATHER TELL HIS WIFE THAT HE WAS IN GENEVA SQUARE DEAREST DI I CAN'T SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE HE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER
4017-231846-0005 AFTER HE LEFT THE HOUSE THEN IF SHE DID NOT KNOW HIS WHEREABOUTS HOW COULD SHE KILL HIM ASKED DENZIL PERTINENTLY BROUGHT TO A POINT WHICH SHE COULD NOT EVADE BELLA DECLINED TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION
4017-231846-0006 BUT TOSSED HER HEAD AND BIT HER LIP WITH A FINE COLOUR ALL HER ACCUSATIONS OF MISSUS VRAIN HAD BEEN MADE GENERALLY AND AS LUCIAN NOTED WERE UNSUPPORTED BY FACT FROM A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW THIS SPITEFUL GOSSIP OF A JEALOUS WOMAN WAS WORTH NOTHING
4017-231846-0007 BUT IN A BROAD SENSE IT WAS CERTAINLY USEFUL IN SHOWING THE DISCORD WHICH HAD EXISTED BETWEEN VRAIN AND HIS WIFE LUCIAN SAW THAT LITTLE GOOD WAS TO BE GAINED FROM THIS PREJUDICED WITNESS SO THANKING MISS TYLER
4017-231846-0008 SAID DIANA HURRIEDLY I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING BELLA WOULD YOU MIND LEAVING THE ROOM OH DEAR NO BURST OUT MISS TYLER ANNOYED AT BEING EXCLUDED I'VE SAID ALL I HAVE TO SAY AND ANYTHING I CAN DO DEAREST DI TO ASSIST YOU AND MISTER

4017-231846-0012 DIANA AND THE BARRISTER WERE TOO DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THEIR BUSINESS TO TAKE MUCH NOTICE OF BELLA'S HYSTERICAL OUTBURST BUT LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER GRAVELY AS SHE DEPARTED WELL MISTER DENZIL SAID THE FORMER REPEATING HER EARLIER QUESTION
4017-231846-0013 WHAT IS TO BE DONE NOW SHALL WE SEE MISSUS VRAIN NOT YET REPLIED LUCIAN QUICKLY WE MUST SECURE PROOFS OF MISSUS VRAIN'S BEING IN THAT YARD BEFORE WE CAN GET ANY CONFESSION OUT OF HER IF YOU WILL LEAVE IT IN MY HANDS MISS VRAIN I SHALL CALL ON MISSUS BENSUSAN
4017-231846-0014 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE OR HER SERVANT MAY KNOW SOMETHING
4017-231846-0015 YES I THINK THAT IS THE NEXT STEP TO TAKE BUT WHAT AM I TO DO IN THE MEANTIME NOTHING IF I WERE YOU I WOULD NOT EVEN SEE MISSUS VRAIN I WILL NOT SEEK HER VOLUNTARILY REPLIED DIANA
4017-231846-0016 THAT I AM IN ENGLAND AND MAY PERHAPS FIND OUT MY ADDRESS AND CALL BUT IF SHE DOES YOU MAY BE SURE THAT I WILL BE MOST JUDICIOUS IN MY REMARKS I LEAVE ALL THAT TO YOUR DISCRETION SAID DENZIL RISING
4017-231846-0017 GOOD BYE MISS VRAIN AS SOON AS I AM IN POSSESSION OF ANY NEW EVIDENCE I SHALL CALL AGAIN GOOD BYE MISTER DENZIL
4017-231846-0018 DIANA MADE THIS REMARK WITH SO KINDLY A LOOK SO BECOMING A BLUSH AND SO WARM A PRESSURE OF THE HAND THAT LUCIAN FELT QUITE OVERCOME AND NOT TRUSTING HIMSELF TO SPEAK
4017-231846-0019 IN SPITE OF THE GRAVITY OF THE TASK IN WHICH HE WAS CONCERNED AT THAT MOMENT HE THOUGHT MORE OF DIANA'S LOOKS AND SPEECH
4017-231846-0020 FROM THESE DAY DREAMS AND WITH A STERN DETERMINATION ADDRESSED HIMSELF RESOLUTELY TO THE WORK IN HAND IN THIS CASE THE BITTER CAME BEFORE THE SWEET BUT BY ACCOMPLISHING THE DESIRE OF DIANA AND SOLVING THE MYSTERY OF HER FATHER'S DEATH
4017-231846-0021 LUCIAN HOPED TO WIN NOT ONLY HER SMILES BUT THE MORE SUBSTANTIAL REWARD OF HER HEART AND HAND BEFORE CALLING ON MISSUS BENSUSAN THE BARRISTER DEBATED WITHIN HIMSELF AS TO WHETHER IT WOULD NOT BE JUDICIOUS TO CALL IN AGAIN
4017-231846-0022 THE ASSISTANCE OF LINK AND BY TELLING HIM OF THE NEW EVIDENCE WHICH HAD BEEN FOUND PLACE HIM THEREBY IN POSSESSION OF NEW MATERIAL TO PROSECUTE THE CASE BUT LINK LATELY HAD TAKEN SO PESSIMISTIC A VIEW OF THE MATTER
4017-231846-0023 THAT LUCIAN FANCIED HE WOULD SCOFF AT HIS LATE DISCOVERIES AND DISCOURAGE HIM IN PROSECUTING WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FRUITLESS QUEST DENZIL WAS ANXIOUS AS DIANA'S KNIGHT
4017-231846-0024 IT IS TRUE THAT HE HAD NO LEGAL AUTHORITY TO MAKE THESE INQUIRIES AND IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT MISSUS BENSUSAN MIGHT REFUSE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS CONCERNING HER OWN BUSINESS UNSANCTIONED BY LAW
4017-231846-0025 LUCIAN FANCIED THAT MISSUS BENSUSAN AS A FAT WOMAN MIGHT ONLY BE GOOD NATURED AND TIMID HE THEREFORE DISMISSED ALL IDEAS OF ASKING LINK TO INTERVENE AND RESOLVED TO RISK A PERSONAL INTERVIEW WITH THE TENANT OF THE JERSEY STREET HOUSE
4017-231846-0026 IT WOULD BE TIME ENOUGH TO INVITE LINK'S ASSISTANCE HE THOUGHT WHEN MISSUS BENSUSAN AS YET AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY IN THE CASE PROVED OBSTINATE IN REPLYING TO HIS QUESTIONS MISSUS BENSUSAN PROVED TO BE QUITE AS STOUT AS MISS GREEB HAD REPORTED
4017-231846-0027 A GIGANTICALLY FAT WOMAN SHE MADE UP IN BREADTH WHAT SHE LACKED IN LENGTH YET SHE SEEMED TO HAVE SOME ACTIVITY ABOUT HER TOO FOR SHE OPENED THE DOOR PERSONALLY TO LUCIAN WHO WAS QUITE AMAZED WHEN HE BEHELD HER MONSTROUS BULK BLOCKING UP THE DOORWAY
4017-231846-0028 HER FACE WAS WHITE AND ROUND LIKE A PALE MOON
4017-231846-0029 AND ON THE WHOLE APPEARED TO BE A TIMID LYMPHATIC WOMAN LIKELY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS PUT TO HER IN A SUFFICIENTLY PEREMPTORY TONE LUCIAN FORESAW THAT HE WAS NOT LIKELY TO HAVE MUCH TROUBLE WITH THIS MOUNTAIN OF FLESH WHAT MIGHT YOU BE PLEASED TO WANT SIR
4017-231846-0030 SHE ASKED LUCIAN IN THE MEEKEST OF VOICES IS IT ABOUT THE LODGINGS YES ANSWERED THE BARRISTER BOLDLY FOR HE GUESSED THAT MISSUS BENSUSAN WOULD SCUTTLE BACK INTO THE HOUSE LIKE A RABBIT TO ITS BURROW DID HE SPEAK TOO PLAINLY AT THE OUTSET THAT IS

4017-231846-0035 AS THE LADY'S BULK GAVE THE LIE TO HER ASSERTION HOWEVER ON DIPLOMATIC GROUNDS HE SUPPRESSED HIS MIRTH AND FOLLOWED HIS PONDEROUS GUIDE
4017-231846-0036 THAT SHE ALMOST FILLED IT HERSELF AS HE LEFT THE PASSAGE HE SAW A BRILLIANT RED HEAD POP DOWN THE STAIRCASE LEADING TO THE BASEMENT BUT WHETHER IT WAS THAT OF A MAN
4017-231846-0037 STILL ON RECALLING MISS GREEB'S DESCRIPTION OF THE BENSUSAN HOUSEHOLD HE CONCLUDED THAT THE RED HEAD WAS THE PROPERTY OF RHODA THE SHARP SERVANT AND ARGUED FROM HER APPEARANCE IN THE BACKGROUND AND RAPID DISAPPEARANCE THAT SHE WAS IN THE HABIT OF LISTENING TO CONVERSATIONS
4017-231846-0038 SHE WAS NOT MEANT TO HEAR MISSUS BENSUSAN SAT DOWN ON THE SOFA AS BEING MOST ACCOMMODATING TO HER BULK AND CAST A WATERY LOOK AROUND THE SMALL APARTMENT WHICH WAS FURNISHED IN THAT EXTRAORDINARY FASHION WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE PECULIAR
