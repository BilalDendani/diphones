5185-24763-0000 PREFACE HUMAN INFIRMITY IN MODERATING AND CHECKING THE EMOTIONS I NAME BONDAGE FOR WHEN A MAN IS A PREY TO HIS EMOTIONS HE IS NOT HIS OWN MASTER BUT LIES AT THE MERCY OF FORTUNE
5185-24763-0001 SO MUCH SO THAT HE IS OFTEN COMPELLED WHILE SEEING THAT WHICH IS BETTER FOR HIM TO FOLLOW THAT WHICH IS WORSE WHY THIS IS SO AND WHAT IS GOOD OR EVIL IN THE EMOTIONS I PROPOSE TO SHOW IN THIS PART OF MY TREATISE
5185-24763-0002 BUT BEFORE I BEGIN IT WOULD BE WELL TO MAKE A FEW PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS ON PERFECTION AND IMPERFECTION GOOD AND EVIL WHEN A MAN HAS PURPOSED TO MAKE A GIVEN THING AND HAS BROUGHT IT TO PERFECTION
5185-24763-0003 HIS WORK WILL BE PRONOUNCED PERFECT NOT ONLY BY HIMSELF BUT BY EVERYONE WHO RIGHTLY KNOWS OR THINKS THAT HE KNOWS THE INTENTION AND AIM OF ITS AUTHOR FOR INSTANCE SUPPOSE ANYONE SEES A WORK WHICH I ASSUME TO BE NOT YET COMPLETED
5185-24763-0004 HE WILL ON THE OTHER HAND CALL IT PERFECT AS SOON AS HE SEES THAT IT IS CARRIED THROUGH TO THE END WHICH ITS AUTHOR HAD PURPOSED FOR IT BUT IF A MAN SEES A WORK THE LIKE WHEREOF HE HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND IF HE KNOWS NOT THE INTENTION OF THE ARTIFICER
5185-24763-0005 HE PLAINLY CANNOT KNOW WHETHER THAT WORK BE PERFECT OR IMPERFECT SUCH SEEMS TO BE THE PRIMARY MEANING OF THESE TERMS BUT AFTER MEN BEGAN TO FORM GENERAL IDEAS
5185-24763-0006 IT CAME ABOUT THAT EACH MAN CALLED PERFECT THAT WHICH HE SAW AGREE WITH THE GENERAL IDEA HE HAD FORMED OF THE THING IN QUESTION AND CALLED IMPERFECT THAT WHICH HE SAW AGREE LESS WITH HIS OWN PRECONCEIVED TYPE
5185-24763-0007 EVEN THOUGH IT HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN COMPLETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE IDEA OF ITS ARTIFICER THIS SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY REASON FOR CALLING NATURAL PHENOMENA WHICH INDEED ARE NOT MADE WITH HUMAN HANDS PERFECT OR IMPERFECT
5185-24763-0008 FOR MEN ARE WONT TO FORM GENERAL IDEAS OF THINGS NATURAL NO LESS THAN OF THINGS ARTIFICIAL AND SUCH IDEAS THEY HOLD AS TYPES BELIEVING THAT NATURE WHO THEY THINK DOES NOTHING WITHOUT AN OBJECT HAS THEM IN VIEW AND HAS SET THEM
5185-24763-0009 AS TYPES BEFORE HERSELF THEREFORE WHEN THEY BEHOLD SOMETHING IN NATURE WHICH DOES NOT WHOLLY CONFORM TO THE PRECONCEIVED TYPE WHICH THEY HAVE FORMED OF THE THING IN QUESTION THEY SAY THAT NATURE HAS FALLEN SHORT OR HAS BLUNDERED AND HAS LEFT HER WORK INCOMPLETE
5185-24763-0010 THUS WE SEE THAT MEN ARE WONT TO STYLE NATURAL PHENOMENA PERFECT OR IMPERFECT RATHER FROM THEIR OWN PREJUDICES THAN FROM TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THEY PRONOUNCE UPON NOW
5185-24763-0011 THAT NATURE DOES NOT WORK WITH AN END IN VIEW FOR THE ETERNAL AND INFINITE BEING WHICH WE CALL GOD OR NATURE
5185-24763-0012 THAT BY THE SAME NECESSITY OF ITS NATURE WHEREBY IT EXISTS IT LIKEWISE WORKS
5185-24763-0013 THE REASON OR CAUSE WHY GOD OR NATURE EXISTS AND THE REASON WHY HE ACTS ARE ONE AND THE SAME THEREFORE AS HE DOES NOT EXIST FOR THE SAKE OF AN END SO NEITHER DOES HE ACT FOR THE SAKE OF AN END
5185-24763-0014 OF HIS EXISTENCE AND OF HIS ACTION THERE IS NEITHER ORIGIN NOR END WHEREFORE A CAUSE WHICH IS CALLED FINAL IS NOTHING ELSE BUT HUMAN DESIRE IN SO FAR AS IT IS CONSIDERED AS THE ORIGIN OR CAUSE OF ANYTHING
5185-24763-0015 FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE SAY THAT TO BE INHABITED IS THE FINAL CAUSE OF THIS OR THAT HOUSE WE MEAN NOTHING MORE THAN THAT A MAN CONCEIVING THE CONVENIENCES OF HOUSEHOLD LIFE HAD A DESIRE TO BUILD A HOUSE WHEREFORE
5185-24763-0016 IS NOTHING ELSE BUT THIS PARTICULAR DESIRE WHICH IS REALLY THE EFFICIENT CAUSE IT IS REGARDED AS THE PRIMARY CAUSE BECAUSE MEN ARE GENERALLY IGNORANT OF THE CAUSES OF THEIR DESIRES THEY ARE AS I HAVE OFTEN SAID ALREADY CONSCIOUS OF THEIR OWN ACTIONS AND APPETITES
5185-24763-0017 BUT IGNORANT OF THE CAUSES WHEREBY THEY ARE DETERMINED TO ANY PARTICULAR DESIRE THEREFORE THE COMMON SAYING THAT NATURE SOMETIMES FALLS SHORT OR BLUNDERS
5185-24763-0018 PERFECTION AND IMPERFECTION THEN ARE IN REALITY MERELY MODES OF THINKING OR NOTIONS WHICH WE FORM FROM A COMPARISON AMONG ONE ANOTHER OF INDIVIDUALS OF THE SAME SPECIES
5185-24763-0019 THAT BY REALITY AND PERFECTION I MEAN THE SAME THING FOR WE ARE WONT TO REFER ALL THE INDIVIDUAL THINGS IN NATURE TO ONE GENUS WHICH IS CALLED THE HIGHEST GENUS NAMELY TO THE CATEGORY OF BEING
5185-24763-0020 THUS IN SO FAR AS WE REFER THE INDIVIDUALS IN NATURE TO THIS CATEGORY AND COMPARING THEM ONE WITH ANOTHER FIND THAT SOME POSSESS MORE OF BEING OR REALITY THAN OTHERS WE TO THIS EXTENT
5185-24763-0021 SAY THAT SOME ARE MORE PERFECT THAN OTHERS AGAIN IN SO FAR AS WE ATTRIBUTE TO THEM ANYTHING IMPLYING NEGATION AS TERM END INFIRMITY ET CETERA WE TO THIS EXTENT CALL THEM IMPERFECT
5185-24763-0022 NOT BECAUSE THEY HAVE ANY INTRINSIC DEFICIENCY OR BECAUSE NATURE HAS BLUNDERED FOR NOTHING LIES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF A THING'S NATURE SAVE THAT WHICH FOLLOWS FROM THE NECESSITY OF THE NATURE OF ITS EFFICIENT CAUSE
5185-24763-0023 AND WHATSOEVER FOLLOWS FROM THE NECESSITY OF THE NATURE OF ITS EFFICIENT CAUSE NECESSARILY COMES TO PASS AS FOR THE TERMS GOOD AND BAD THEY INDICATE NO POSITIVE QUALITY IN THINGS
5185-24763-0024 REGARDED IN THEMSELVES BUT ARE MERELY MODES OF THINKING OR NOTIONS WHICH WE FORM FROM THE COMPARISON OF THINGS ONE WITH ANOTHER THUS ONE AND THE SAME THING CAN BE AT THE SAME TIME GOOD BAD AND INDIFFERENT FOR INSTANCE
5185-24763-0025 MUSIC IS GOOD FOR HIM THAT IS MELANCHOLY BAD FOR HIM THAT MOURNS FOR HIM THAT IS DEAF IT IS NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD NEVERTHELESS THOUGH THIS BE SO THE TERMS SHOULD STILL BE RETAINED
5185-24763-0026 FOR INASMUCH AS WE DESIRE TO FORM AN IDEA OF MAN AS A TYPE OF HUMAN NATURE WHICH WE MAY HOLD IN VIEW IT WILL BE USEFUL FOR US TO RETAIN THE TERMS IN QUESTION IN THE SENSE I HAVE INDICATED IN WHAT FOLLOWS THEN
5185-24763-0027 I SHALL MEAN BY GOOD THAT WHICH WE CERTAINLY KNOW TO BE A MEANS OF APPROACHING MORE NEARLY TO THE TYPE OF HUMAN NATURE WHICH WE HAVE SET BEFORE OURSELVES BY BAD THAT WHICH WE CERTAINLY KNOW TO BE A HINDRANCE TO US IN APPROACHING THE SAID TYPE
5185-24763-0028 ARE MORE PERFECT OR MORE IMPERFECT IN PROPORTION AS THEY APPROACH MORE OR LESS NEARLY TO THE SAID TYPE FOR IT MUST BE SPECIALLY REMARKED THAT WHEN I SAY THAT A MAN PASSES FROM A LESSER TO A GREATER PERFECTION OR VICE VERSA
5185-24763-0029 I DO NOT MEAN THAT HE IS CHANGED FROM ONE ESSENCE OR REALITY TO ANOTHER FOR INSTANCE A HORSE WOULD BE AS COMPLETELY DESTROYED BY BEING CHANGED INTO A MAN AS BY BEING CHANGED INTO AN INSECT WHAT I MEAN IS THAT WE CONCEIVE THE THING'S POWER OF ACTION
5185-24763-0030 IN SO FAR AS THIS IS UNDERSTOOD BY ITS NATURE TO BE INCREASED OR DIMINISHED LASTLY BY PERFECTION IN GENERAL I SHALL AS I HAVE SAID MEAN REALITY IN OTHER WORDS
5185-24763-0031 FOR NO GIVEN THING CAN BE SAID TO BE MORE PERFECT BECAUSE IT HAS PASSED A LONGER TIME IN EXISTENCE THE DURATION OF THINGS CANNOT BE DETERMINED BY THEIR ESSENCE FOR THE ESSENCE OF THINGS INVOLVES NO FIXED AND DEFINITE PERIOD OF EXISTENCE BUT EVERYTHING
5185-24763-0032 WHETHER IT BE MORE PERFECT OR LESS PERFECT WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO PERSIST IN EXISTENCE WITH THE SAME FORCE WHEREWITH IT BEGAN TO EXIST WHEREFORE IN THIS RESPECT ALL THINGS ARE EQUAL DEFINITIONS
5185-24763-0033 ONE BY GOOD I MEAN THAT WHICH WE CERTAINLY KNOW TO BE USEFUL TO US TWO BY EVIL I MEAN THAT WHICH WE CERTAINLY KNOW TO BE A HINDRANCE TO US IN THE ATTAINMENT OF ANY GOOD
5185-24763-0034 CONCERNING THESE TERMS SEE THE FOREGOING PREFACE TOWARDS THE END THREE PARTICULAR THINGS I CALL CONTINGENT IN SO FAR AS WHILE REGARDING THEIR ESSENCE ONLY WE FIND NOTHING THEREIN
5185-24763-0035 WHICH NECESSARILY ASSERTS THEIR EXISTENCE OR EXCLUDES IT FOUR PARTICULAR THINGS I CALL POSSIBLE IN SO FAR AS WHILE REGARDING THE CAUSES
5185-24763-0036 BY CONFLICTING EMOTIONS I MEAN THOSE WHICH DRAW A MAN IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THOUGH THEY ARE OF THE SAME KIND SUCH AS LUXURY AND AVARICE WHICH ARE BOTH SPECIES OF LOVE AND ARE CONTRARIES NOT BY NATURE
5185-24763-0037 BUT BY ACCIDENT SIX WHAT I MEAN BY EMOTION FELT TOWARDS A THING FUTURE PRESENT AND PAST
5185-24763-0038 BUT I SHOULD HERE ALSO REMARK THAT WE CAN ONLY DISTINCTLY CONCEIVE DISTANCE OF SPACE OR TIME UP TO A CERTAIN DEFINITE LIMIT THAT IS
5185-24763-0039 ALL OBJECTS DISTANT FROM US MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FEET OR WHOSE DISTANCE FROM THE PLACE WHERE WE ARE EXCEEDS THAT WHICH WE CAN DISTINCTLY CONCEIVE SEEM TO BE AN EQUAL DISTANCE FROM US AND ALL IN THE SAME PLANE
5185-24763-0040 SO ALSO OBJECTS WHOSE TIME OF EXISTING IS CONCEIVED AS REMOVED FROM THE PRESENT BY A LONGER INTERVAL THAN WE CAN DISTINCTLY CONCEIVE SEEM TO BE ALL EQUALLY DISTANT FROM THE PRESENT AND ARE SET DOWN AS IT WERE TO THE SAME MOMENT OF TIME
5185-24763-0041 SEVEN BY AN END FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH WE DO SOMETHING I MEAN A DESIRE EIGHT BY VIRTUE VIRTUS AND POWER I MEAN THE SAME THING THAT IS
5185-24763-0042 AS IT IS REFERRED TO MAN IS A MAN'S NATURE OR ESSENCE IN SO FAR AS IT HAS THE POWER OF EFFECTING WHAT CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE LAWS OF THAT NATURE AXIOM
5185-24763-0043 THERE IS NO INDIVIDUAL THING IN NATURE THAN WHICH THERE IS NOT ANOTHER MORE POWERFUL AND STRONG WHATSOEVER THING BE GIVEN
