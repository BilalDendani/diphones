7286-92930-0000 MOLLY PITCHER IN THE DAYS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION A YOUNG WOMAN LIVED AS A SERVANT IN CARLISLE PENNSYLVANIA WITH THE FAMILY OF GENERAL IRVING A RETIRED BRITISH OFFICER
7286-92930-0001 WHO HAD FOUGHT IN THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR AND HAD SEEN A GREAT DEAL OF SERVICE THIS YOUNG WOMAN WAS NAMED MOLLY LUDWIG HAYS
7286-92930-0002 HE HAD WON HER HAND WITH DIFFICULTY FOR MOLLY WAS A BELLE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE SHE WAS NOT ONLY HANDSOME BUT AS STRONG AS A MAN ABLE TO CARRY A HEAVY MEAL SACK ON HER SHOULDER AND ONE OF THE HARDEST WORKERS THAT THE TOWN KNEW
7286-92930-0003 SHE WASHED AND SCRUBBED AND SCOURED AND BAKED FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT AND SEEMED TO REVEL IN THE HARD WORK THAT GAVE THE NEEDED EXERCISE TO HER STRONG MUSCLES THROUGHOUT HER LIFE MOLLY HAYS HAD ADMIRED SOLDIERS
7286-92930-0004 AND MORE THAN ONCE SHE EXPRESSED HERSELF IN NO UNDECIDED TERMS TO THE EFFECT THAT SHE WISHED SHE WERE A MAN SO THAT SHE COULD BEAR ARMS
7286-92930-0005 AND BE A SOLDIER HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS STILL A VERY YOUNG WOMAN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION FOR FREEDOM FROM GREAT BRITAIN BROKE OUT ALL THE COUNTRY WAS AFLAME AND RANG WITH THE STORIES OF WHAT HAPPENED AT LEXINGTON AND BUNKER HILL
7286-92930-0006 MAN AFTER MAN FROM THE VILLAGE TOOK HIS POWDER HORN AND MUSKET AND WENT OFF TO ENLIST FOR THE WAR AND MOLLY GREW MORE AND MORE RESTLESS AS SHE SAW THEM GO AT LAST HER HUSBAND CAME TO HER SOMEWHAT SHEEPISHLY
7286-92930-0007 FOR HE DISLIKED TO TELL HER THE INTENTION HE HAD IN HIS HEART BUT AT LENGTH HE MADE HER UNDERSTAND THAT JUST BECAUSE HE WAS MARRIED WAS NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD REMAIN AT HOME WITH THE WOMEN AND HE TOO INTENDED TO ENLIST THAT VERY DAY
7286-92930-0008 MOLLY CONSENTED WITH THE UTMOST ENTHUSIASM SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE WOULD BE PROUD TO BE THE WIFE OF A SOLDIER SINCE SHE COULD NOT BE ONE HERSELF AND BADE HIM FAREWELL WITH THE ADMONISHMENT TO DO HIS PART BRAVELY
7286-92930-0009 AND TO BEAR HIMSELF LIKE THE MAN SHE KNEW HIM TO BE AND SHE STOOD AT THE DOOR OF THEIR HOME WAVING GOOD BY TO HIM WITH A CHEERFUL FACE THAT GAVE NO HINT OF HER ACHING HEART
7286-92930-0010 WHEN HER HUSBAND HAD DEPARTED MOLLY RETURNED TO THE IRVING HOUSEHOLD WHERE SHE WORKED AS WELL AS SHE HAD BEFORE HER MARRIAGE TRYING TO FIND RELIEF IN THE HEAVY LABOR FROM THE PAIN OF HAVING LOST HER HUSBAND
7286-92930-0011 AND THE ACHING DESIRE TO GO AND DO HER PART BESIDE HIM EVEN THOUGH SHE WERE A WOMAN FATE THOUGHT MOLLY HAD MADE A SAD MISTAKE IN MAKING HER A WOMAN FOR SHE KNEW THAT IN SPITE OF HER PETTICOATS SHE COULD SOLDIER AS WELL AS THE MEN
7286-92930-0012 AND IF SHE HAD ONLY BEEN A MAN SHE BELIEVED SHE COULD HAVE RISEN TO AN IMPORTANT POSITION IN THE ARMY THE TIDE OF THE STRUGGLE WAVERED AND BATTLES WITH THE RED COATS WERE FOUGHT AND WON
7286-92930-0013 IT WAS HARD TO GET THE NEWSPAPERS IN THOSE TIMES AND NEWS OF THE ARMIES AND THEIR DOINGS WAS OFTEN WEEKS BEHIND THE ACTUAL EVENTS MOLLY HOPED AND WAITED BUT FOR WEEKS AT A TIME SHE WENT WITHOUT WORD FROM HER HUSBAND
7286-92930-0014 AND DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HE WERE ALIVE OR DEAD ONE DAY A MESSENGER CALLED FOR HER AT THE IRVING HOUSEHOLD HE HAD A LETTER FROM JOHN HAYS FOR MOLLY AND IT NOT ONLY TOLD HER THAT HE WAS ALIVE AND WELL BUT WAS IN CAMP NOT FAR OFF FROM HER FORMER HOME
7286-92930-0015 IN TRENTON NEW JERSEY WHERE HER AGED PARENTS WERE STILL LIVING THE LETTER ENDED BY TELLING HER TO COME TO TRENTON AND LIVE WITH HER PARENTS FOR HE WOULD BE ABLE WITHOUT DOUBT TO GET LEAVE FROM HIS COMMAND AND SEE HER OFTEN
7286-92930-0016 SOON THE WAR ITSELF WAS BEING FOUGHT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF HER HOME THE AMERICANS ATTACKED THE BRITISH NEAR PRINCETON KILLING AND CAPTURING A LARGE NUMBER THEN WASHINGTON WITH HIS SMALL FORCE WITHDREW FROM THAT REGION
7286-92930-0017 BEFORE REENFORCEMENTS COULD BE BROUGHT AGAINST HIM AND NOW MOLLY FOUND THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT SHE COULD DO NAMELY GO AND CARE FOR THE WOUNDED WHO WERE STILL LYING WHERE THEY HAD FALLEN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
7286-92930-0018 THE BRITISH GENERAL CORNWALLIS AND HIS MEN WERE APPROACHING BUT THAT DID NOT WORRY HER A WHIT AND SHE WENT TO AND FRO UPON THE BATTLEFIELD CARRYING WATER FOR PARCHED THROATS AND BINDING WOUNDS UNTIL THE BRITISH SOLDIERS WERE ACTUALLY UPON HER
7286-92930-0019 THEN MOLLY SAW A CANNON POINTED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BRITISH AND TO HER SURPRISE IT WAS LOADED AND THERE WAS A FUSE STILL SMOLDERING AND LYING NEAR AT HAND SHE STUDIED THE CANNON CAREFULLY
7286-92930-0020 AND IT SEEMED TO BE AIMED RIGHT AT A GROUP OF THE ENEMY THAT WAS APPROACHING THE BRAVE GIRL DROPPED THE PAIL OF WATER THAT SHE HAD BEEN CARRYING PICKED UP THE FUSE AND APPLIED IT TO THE TOUCH HOLE
7286-92930-0021 THEY HAD BELIEVED THAT THE AMERICANS WERE FAR AWAY AND HERE THIS GUN GAVE WARNING THAT THEY WERE STILL NEAR AT HAND OR AT ANY RATE HAD LEFT A STRONG REAR GUARD WITH ARTILLERY TO DELAY THEM IN THEIR PURSUIT
7286-92930-0022 SHE WOULD HAVE HAD BUT LITTLE CHANCE OF MERCY AT THEIR HANDS AND WOULD AT ONCE HAVE FACED A FIRING SQUAD OR BEEN HUNG TO THE NEAREST TREE AS IT WAS THEY THOUGHT SHE WAS ONLY SOME COUNTRY GIRL WHO HAD PERHAPS LOST SOME RELATIVE IN THE RECENT BATTLE
7286-92930-0023 AND WAS CARRYING HIS DEAD BODY BACK TO HER HOME AND SO THEY PAID NO ATTENTION TO HER MOLLY HOWEVER BY FIRING THIS SHOT HAD MATERIALLY AIDED GENERAL WASHINGTON FOR ANY DELAY OF THE BRITISH EVEN A SLIGHT ONE
7286-92930-0024 GAVE A GREAT ADVANTAGE TO THE AMERICANS WHO WERE HURRYING FROM SUPERIOR NUMBERS TO PUT THEMSELVES IN A GOOD TACTICAL POSITION AS SOON AS THEY COULD ON A HOT DAY OF JULY IN THE FOLLOWING SUMMER
7286-92930-0025 IT CHANCED THAT WASHINGTON'S FORCES WERE AGAIN NOT FAR AWAY FROM MOLLY'S HOME AND SHE TOOK A DIFFICULT JOURNEY ON THE CHANCE OF SEEING HER HUSBAND HER FIRST STEP IN SOLDIERING HAD BEEN TAKEN WHEN SHE FIRED THE CANNON AT THE BRITISH IN THE PRECEDING YEAR
7286-92930-0026 A FAR GREATER ADVENTURE LAY BEFORE HER FOR SHE FELL IN WITH THE AMERICAN SOLDIERS JUST AS THEY COMMENCED THE SEVERE BATTLE OF MONMOUTH THIS BATTLE HAD CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE AS A COMPARATIVELY LARGE NUMBER OF TROOPS WERE ENGAGED IN IT
7286-92930-0027 GENERAL WASHINGTON WAS IN COMMAND OF THE AMERICANS AND THE ENGLISH WERE LED BY SIR HENRY CLINTON THE ENGLISH HAD BEEN RETREATING FROM PHILADELPHIA ACROSS NEW JERSEY FOLLOWED BY WASHINGTON
7286-92930-0028 AND THE AMERICAN GENERAL HAD DECIDED TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK ON THE LEFT WING OF THE RETREATING FORCES AND GENERAL LEE WAS ORDERED BY WASHINGTON TO ATTACK THE ENGLISH ON THE FLANK AND HOLD THEM IN BATTLE UNTIL HE HIMSELF COULD COME UP WITH THE BULK OF THE AMERICAN ARMY
7286-92930-0029 GENERAL LEE HOWEVER PROVED TO BE A POOR MAN FOR THIS TASK AND HIS INDECISION AND SEMI COWARDICE LEFT WASHINGTON EXPOSED TO THE BRUNT OF THE ENEMY'S ATTACK BEFORE HE WAS PREPARED TO MEET IT AND AGAINST THE INTENTIONS OF THE AMERICAN COMMANDER
7286-92930-0030 THE SITUATION WAS SAVED BY GENERAL GREENE WHO SAW WHAT HAD HAPPENED CHANGED HIS OWN PLANS AND DIVERTED THE ATTACK OF THE BRITISH TO HIS OWN POSITION FROM WHICH HE POURED IN A HEAVY ARTILLERY FIRE THAT CAUSED THEM TERRIBLE LOSSES
7286-92930-0031 JOHN HAYS WAS ONE OF THE CANNONEERS OF GREENE'S ARTILLERY AND HE WORKED ALL DAY LOADING AND FIRING HIS PIECE IT WAS A TERRIBLY HOT DAY AND MANY MEN IN BOTH THE BRITISH AND THE AMERICAN ARMIES FELL EXHAUSTED
7286-92930-0032 AND EVEN DIED FROM THE HEAT OF THE SUN ALL THIS TIME MOLLY HAYS HAD BEEN CARING FOR THE WOUNDED AND CARRYING WATER TO THE THIRSTY GUNNERS USING FOR THE PURPOSE THE BUCKET THAT WAS ATTACHED TO HER HUSBAND'S CANNON FOR CLEANING PURPOSES
7286-92930-0033 TIRELESSLY SHE CONTINUED HER EFFORTS TO CARE FOR THE WOUNDED AND COMFORT THE FIGHTING SOLDIERS HEEDLESS OF THE BULLETS THAT CAME HER WAY OR OF THE GENERAL TURMOIL OF BATTLE AS THE DAY WORE ON THE MEN WOULD GREET HER COMING WITH
7286-92930-0034 HERE COMES MOLLY WITH HER PITCHER AND GRADUALLY THIS WAS CHANGED TO HERE COMES MOLLY PITCHER AND THIS WAS THE NAME THAT HISTORY HAS ADOPTED IN REGARD TO THE BRAVE WOMAN FOR WHOM IT WAS SO USED
7286-92930-0035 AT LAST JOHN HAYS SUCCUMBED TO THE HEAT AND FELL UNCONSCIOUS BESIDE HIS GUN THE SUN HAD PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM MOLLY STOPPED CARRYING WATER TO CARE FOR HER HUSBAND SHE BATHED HIS HEAD AND MOVED HIM INTO THE SHADE
7286-92930-0036 RETURNING TO HER DUTIES JUST IN TIME TO HEAR GENERAL KNOX GIVE ORDERS THAT THE CANNON BE REMOVED BECAUSE HE HAD NO OTHER GUNNER COOL ENOUGH AND SKILFUL ENOUGH TO WORK IT IN ITS PRESENT EXPOSED POSITION AT THIS MOLLY SPRANG FORWARD CRYING OUT
7286-92930-0037 I CAN FIRE IT I AM A GUNNER'S WIFE AND KNOW HOW TO LOAD AND FIRE A CANNON I'LL TAKE THE PLACE THAT MY BRAVE HUSBAND HAS LEFT AND RUNNING TO THE GUN MOLLY COMMENCED TO LOAD AND FIRE SO DETERMINEDLY AND SKILFULLY
7286-92930-0038 THAT A GASP OF AMAZEMENT RAN THROUGH THE MEN THAT SAW HER FOR MANY WEARY HOURS SHE TOILED AT THE GUN UNTIL THE BRITISH WERE DRIVEN BACK
7286-92930-0039 BEFORE SHE LEFT HER CANNON GENERAL GREENE HIMSELF CAME OVER TO WHERE SHE STOOD AND GRASPING HER HAND THANKED HER IN THE NAME OF THE AMERICAN ARMY THIS WAS NOT ALL THE TRIUMPH SHE RECEIVED HOWEVER
7286-92930-0040 FOR WORD WAS SOON BROUGHT TO HER THAT GENERAL WASHINGTON HIMSELF WISHED TO SEE HER SHE WAS IN HER RAGGED GRIMY CLOTHES IN WHICH SHE HAD FOUGHT AND SUCCORED THE WOUNDED THROUGH THE WHOLE OF THAT HOT DAY
7286-92930-0041 AND SHE NOW PUT ON A SOLDIER'S COAT IN WHICH TO MEET THE GENERAL WASHINGTON PRAISED HER HIGHLY AND BEFORE A LARGE NUMBER OF HIS OFFICERS AND MEN
7286-92930-0042 AND NOT ONLY THE AMERICANS DID HER HONOR BUT THE FRENCH AS WELL FOR THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE WITH HIS OWN HAND PRESENTED HER WITH A PURSE OF GOLDEN CROWNS
7286-92930-0043 AND THE NAME OF MOLLY PITCHER AS SHE WAS EVER AFTER CALLED BECAME ONE OF THE GREAT NAMES OF AMERICAN HISTORY AFTER THE WAR WAS ENDED SHE LIVED WITH HER HUSBAND UNTIL HE DIED AND LATER SHE MARRIED AGAIN
