2238-121415-0000 THE BEGGAR OF SAINT EUSTACHE D'ARTAGNAN HAD CALCULATED THAT IN NOT GOING AT ONCE TO THE PALAIS ROYAL HE WOULD GIVE COMMINGES TIME TO ARRIVE BEFORE HIM
2238-121415-0001 AND CONSEQUENTLY TO MAKE THE CARDINAL ACQUAINTED WITH THE EMINENT SERVICES WHICH HE D'ARTAGNAN AND HIS FRIEND HAD RENDERED TO THE QUEEN'S PARTY IN THE MORNING THEY WERE INDEED ADMIRABLY RECEIVED BY MAZARIN
2238-121415-0002 WHO PAID THEM NUMEROUS COMPLIMENTS AND ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE MORE THAN HALF ON THEIR WAY TO OBTAIN WHAT THEY DESIRED NAMELY D'ARTAGNAN HIS CAPTAINCY PORTHOS HIS BARONY D'ARTAGNAN WOULD HAVE PREFERRED MONEY IN HAND TO ALL THAT FINE TALK
2238-121415-0003 FOR HE KNEW WELL THAT TO MAZARIN IT WAS EASY TO PROMISE AND HARD TO PERFORM BUT THOUGH HE HELD THE CARDINAL'S PROMISES AS OF LITTLE WORTH HE AFFECTED TO BE COMPLETELY SATISFIED FOR HE WAS UNWILLING TO DISCOURAGE PORTHOS
2238-121415-0004 WHILST THE TWO FRIENDS WERE WITH THE CARDINAL THE QUEEN SENT FOR HIM MAZARIN THINKING THAT IT WOULD BE THE MEANS OF INCREASING THE ZEAL OF HIS TWO DEFENDERS IF HE PROCURED THEM PERSONAL THANKS FROM THE QUEEN
2238-121415-0005 MOTIONED THEM TO FOLLOW HIM D'ARTAGNAN AND PORTHOS POINTED TO THEIR DUSTY AND TORN DRESSES BUT THE CARDINAL SHOOK HIS HEAD THOSE COSTUMES HE SAID ARE OF MORE WORTH THAN MOST OF THOSE WHICH YOU WILL SEE ON THE BACKS OF THE QUEEN'S COURTIERS
2238-121415-0006 COMMINGES WAS NEAR THE QUEEN WHO WAS QUESTIONING HIM UPON THE DETAILS OF HIS EXPEDITION AND EVERY ONE WAS LISTENING TO HIS ACCOUNT WHEN D'ARTAGNAN AND PORTHOS WERE PERCEIVED AT THE DOOR BEHIND THE CARDINAL
