3060-163542-0000 INTRODUCTION TO APPENDIX ANANZI STORIES THE NEGROES IN THE WEST INDIES
3060-163542-0001 WHICH THEIR FATHERS AND GRANDFATHERS BROUGHT WITH THEM FROM AFRICA SOME THIRTY YEARS BACK THESE ANANZI STORIES AS THEY ARE CALLED WERE INVARIABLY TOLD AT THE NEGRO WAKES
3060-163542-0002 WHICH LASTED FOR NINE SUCCESSIVE NIGHTS THE RECITERS WERE ALWAYS MEN IN THOSE DAYS WHEN THE SLAVES WERE STILL HALF HEATHEN
3060-163542-0003 OBEAH WAS UNIVERSALLY BELIEVED IN SUCH OF THE NEGROES AS ATTENDED CHURCH OR CHAPEL KEPT THEIR CHILDREN AWAY FROM THESE FUNERAL GATHERINGS THE WAKES ARE NOW IT IS BELIEVED
3060-163542-0004 ALMOST ENTIRELY DISCONTINUED AND WITH THEM HAVE GONE THE STORIES THE NEGROES ARE VERY SHY OF TELLING THEM AND BOTH THE CLERGYMAN OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND THE DISSENTING MINISTER
3060-163542-0005 SET THEIR FACES AGAINST THEM AND CALL THEM FOOLISHNESS THE TRANSLATOR WHOSE EARLY CHILDHOOD WAS PASSED IN THOSE ISLANDS REMEMBERS TO HAVE HEARD SUCH STORIES FROM HIS NURSE WHO WAS AN AFRICAN BORN
3060-163542-0006 BUT BEYOND A STRAY FRAGMENT HERE AND THERE THE RICH STORE WHICH SHE POSSESSED HAS ALTOGETHER ESCAPED HIS MEMORY THE FOLLOWING STORIES HAVE BEEN TAKEN DOWN FROM THE MOUTH OF A WEST INDIAN NURSE
3060-163542-0007 IN HIS SISTER'S HOUSE WHO BORN AND BRED IN IT IS RATHER REGARDED AS A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY THAN AS A SERVANT THEY ARE PRINTED JUST AS SHE TOLD THEM
3060-163542-0008 WILL BE SELF EVIDENT THUS WE HAVE THE WISHING TREE OF THE HINDOOS THE KALPA VRIKSHA OF SOMADEVA
3060-163542-0009 WHICH THROWS DOWN AS MANY PUMPKINS AS THE POOR WIDOW WISHES IN ONE STORY WE HAVE BOOTS TO THE LIFE WHILE THE MAN WHOM HE OUTWITS IS OWN BROTHER TO THE NORSE TROLLS
3060-163542-0010 IN ANOTHER WE FIND A SPEAKING BEAST WHICH REMINDS US AT ONCE OF THE EGYPTIAN STORY OF ANESSOU AND SATOU AS WELL AS OF THE MACHANDELBOOM
3060-163542-0011 WE FIND HERE THE WOMAN WHO WASHES THE DIRTY HEAD REWARDED AND THE MAN WHO REFUSES TO WASH IT PUNISHED IN THE VERY WORDS USED IN
3060-163542-0012 WE FIND TOO IN NANCY FAIRY THE SAME STORY BOTH IN GROUNDWORK AND INCIDENT AS WE HAVE IN THE LASSIE AND HER GODMOTHER AND MOST SURPRISING OF ALL
3060-163542-0013 IN THE STORY OF ANANZI AND QUANQUA WE FIND THE VERY TRAIT ABOUT A TRICK PLAYED WITH THE TAIL OF AN OX
3060-163542-0014 BOOTS WHO ATE A MATCH WITH THE TROLL HERE IS THE VARIATION WHILST HE WAS WITH THE TROLL THE LAD WAS TO GO OUT TO WATCH THE SWINE
3060-163542-0015 BUT FIRST HE CUT THEIR TAILS OFF AND STUCK THEM INTO THE GROUND THEN HE WENT HOME TO THE TROLL
3060-163542-0016 BUT WHEN THE TROLL SAW THE SWINE'S TAILS STICKING OUT OF THE GROUND HE WANTED TO PULL THEM BACK AGAIN
3060-163542-0017 AND GAVE A GREAT TUG AND THEN
3060-163542-0018 THEY ARE CALLED ANANZI STORIES BECAUSE SO MANY OF THEM TURN ON THE FEATS OF ANANZI WHOSE CHARACTER IS A MIXTURE OF THE MASTER THIEF AND OF BOOTS
3060-163542-0019 BUT THE MOST CURIOUS THING ABOUT HIM IS THAT HE ILLUSTRATES THE BEAST EPIC IN A REMARKABLE WAY IN ALL THE WEST INDIAN ISLANDS ANANZI IS THE NAME OF SPIDERS IN GENERAL
3060-163542-0020 AND OF A VERY BEAUTIFUL SPIDER WITH YELLOW STRIPES IN PARTICULAR FOOTNOTE COMPARE CROWTHER'S YORUBA GLOSSARY WHERE ALANSASA IS GIVEN AS THE YORUBAN FOR SPIDER
3060-163542-0021 THE CHANGE OF N INTO L IS NOT UNCOMMON EVEN SUPPOSING THE WEST INDIAN WORD TO BE UNCORRUPT
3060-163542-0022 THE NEGROES THINK
3060-163542-0023 BUT THAT HIS SUPERIOR CUNNING ENABLES HIM TO TAKE ANY SHAPE HE PLEASES IN FACT HE IS THE EXAMPLE WHICH THE AFRICAN TRIBES FROM WHICH THESE STORIES CAME HAVE CHOSEN TO TAKE AS POINTING OUT THE SUPERIORITY OF WIT
3060-163542-0024 IN THIS WAY THEY HAVE MATCHED THE CLEVERNESS AND DEXTERITY OF THE SPIDER AGAINST THE BONE AND MUSCLE OF THE LION INVARIABLY TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE LATTER AFTER THIS INTRODUCTION
3060-163542-0025 WE LET THE TALES SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES ONLY PREMISING THAT THE
3060-163542-0026 IS A VERY PRETTY FLY OF THE WASP KIND AND LIKE HIS EUROPEAN BROTHER
3060-163542-0027 THAT THE CUSH CUSH IS A LITTLE RED YAM WHICH IMPARTS A STRONG RED DYE TO EVERYTHING WITH WHICH IT IS BOILED
