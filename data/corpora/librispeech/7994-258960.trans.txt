7994-258960-0000 THE APPLE TREE IS VALUED BECAUSE IT BEARS FRUIT AND THE ORCHARD BECAUSE THE TREES GIVE PROMISE OF YIELDING A SUCCESSION OF CROPS FOR YEARS TO COME THERE ARE THUS TWO PROBLEMS OF VALUE IN CONNECTION WITH DURABLE GOODS
7994-258960-0001 THAT OF THE VALUE OF A TEMPORARY USE FOR A BRIEF PERIOD AS FOR A YEAR AND THAT OF THE VALUE OF A THING ITSELF THE USE BEARER FOR A LONG SERIES OF YEARS OR IN PERPETUITY
7994-258960-0002 TO EXPLAIN WHAT FIXES THE VALUE OF THE TEMPORARY USE IS THE PROBLEM OF RENT TO EXPLAIN WHAT DETERMINES THE VALUE OF LONG CONTINUED USE OR OF PERMANENT CONTROL AND OWNERSHIP OF A USE BEARER
7994-258960-0003 THE WORD COMES FROM THE LOW LATIN RENTA FROM RENDA IN TURN
7994-258960-0004 THAT WHICH IS GIVEN YIELDED OR GIVEN BACK OR RENDITA THAT WHICH IS GIVEN OR RETURNED THE FRENCH RENDRE ENGLISH RENDER TO GIVE OR RETURN THAT WHICH BELONGS TO ONE
7994-258960-0005 IS USED VERY EARLY CHAUCER USED RENTE AS AN INCOME
7994-258960-0006 CATTLE PROBABLY MEANING PROPERTY CHATTELS AND RENTE INCOME RENTAL IS A COLLECTIVE TERM FOR A NUMBER OF RENTS THE TOTAL YIELD OF AN ESTATE WAS CALLED ITS RENTAL OR RENT ROLL AND A LIST OF THE VARIOUS SOURCES OF INCOME
7994-258960-0007 INCLUDING ALL PAYMENTS FROM TENANTS IN MONEY PRODUCE OR SERVICES
7994-258960-0008 THREE THE POPULAR MEANING OF RENT IS THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE USE OF MATERIAL THINGS WHICH MUST BE RETURNED TO THE OWNERS AFTER THE TIME OF USE AGREED UPON WE SPEAK OF THE RENT OF A HOUSE BOAT ET CETERA
7994-258960-0009 USING THE WORD AS A SYNONYM FOR HIRE IN THE EUROPEAN LANGUAGES THE WORD IS USED MORE FREQUENTLY IN THAT SENSE IN THE FRENCH LA RENTE MEANS THE INCOME FROM ANY KIND OF PROPERTY
7994-258960-0010 BUT CORPORATE SECURITIES AND NATIONAL BONDS CAME PARTICULARLY TO BE CALLED
7994-258960-0011 BECAUSE THEY ARE A FORM OF INVESTMENT YIELDING A PERMANENT INCOME THE ONE WHO HAS A PERPETUAL INCOME FROM BONDS OR RENTS IS CALLED A
7994-258960-0012 AND CAPITALRENTE THE INCOME USUALLY IN ENGLAND CALLED INTEREST A RESTRICTED MEANING HAS LONG BEEN APPLIED BY ECONOMISTS TO THE WORD THE INCOME YIELDED BY LANDS ET CETERA
7994-258960-0013 THIS WAS PUT IN CONTRAST WITH INTEREST FOR MONEY AND CAPITAL AND WITH WAGES OF LABOR THIS MEANING IS NOW BEING ABANDONED BY ECONOMIC STUDENTS A WIDER MEANING RECENTLY GIVEN TO THE WORD BY MANY ECONOMISTS
7994-258960-0014 TURNS ON THE SUPPOSED RELATION OF SOME PORTIONS OF PRICE TO COST OF PRODUCTION THUS FREQUENT USE IS MADE OF THE EXPRESSIONS CONSUMER'S RENT PRODUCER'S RENT BUYER'S RENT
7994-258960-0015 MEANTIME NO ECONOMIST CAN DICTATE WHAT MEANING IS TO BE ATTACHED TO THE TERM BUT ONE MAY SUGGEST THE DEFINITION THAT SEEMS TO HIM MOST EXPEDIENT THROUGHOUT THIS WORK WE SHALL ENDEAVOR TO USE THE TERM RENT UNIFORMLY AND CONSISTENTLY
7994-258960-0016 FOUR THE ESSENTIAL THOUGHT IN RENT AS WE SHALL USE IT
7994-258960-0017 AS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE VALUE OF THE USE BEARER OR THING ITSELF THE MEANING OF USUFRUCT IS THE USE OF THE FRUITS OR IN LEGAL PHRASE
7994-258960-0018 BY A METAPHOR THE WORD IN LEGAL DISCUSSION IS APPLIED TO THE USE OF ANY PRODUCT AND WE SHALL EMPLOY IT AS IN COMMON SPEECH IN REFERENCE TO ONE'S OWN GOODS
7994-258960-0019 THE QUALITIES WHOSE USE GIVES VALUE ARE NOT USUALLY INDESTRUCTIBLE
7994-258960-0020 THERE IS A FAMOUS PHRASE USED BY RICARDO RENT IS PAID FOR THE ORIGINAL AND INDESTRUCTIBLE QUALITIES OF THE SOIL HE SAID INDESTRUCTIBLE BUT THE WORD IS NOT APT
7994-258960-0021 THERE ARE MANY QUALITIES IN THE FERTILE FIELD THAT MUST BE DESTROYED WHEN IT IS USED EVERY ECONOMIST SINCE RICARDO'S TIME HAS RECOGNIZED THIS AND MANY EXCUSES FOR THE INACCURACY HAVE BEEN GIVEN AFTER EVERY HARVEST
7994-258960-0022 THE FIELD IS LESS SERVICEABLE THAN BEFORE AND IF IT IS TO BE OF THE SAME GRADE OF EFFICIENCY THE FERTILE ELEMENTS MUST BE RESTORED WE CANNOT ASSERT THAT RICARDO MEANT UNDESTROYED FOR HE WAS NOT QUITE CLEAR ON THE QUESTION
7994-258960-0023 IT IS ONLY BY A FICTION THAT MOST INDIRECT AGENTS CAN BE REGARDED AS INDESTRUCTIBLE THINGS YIELDING RENT ARE NOT INDESTRUCTIBLE
7994-258960-0024 IS ESTIMATED ALLOWANCE MUST BE MADE FOR REPAIRS DEPRECIATION AND FOR VARIOUS EXPENSES WHICH ABSORB A GOOD PORTION OF THE GROSS PRODUCT WHEN THIS ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN MADE THE INCOME MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A NET SUM NOT DUE TO THE SALE
7994-258960-0025 OR TO THE USING UP OF ANY PART OF THE THING RENTED THIS IS THE ESSENTIAL THOUGHT IN TYPICAL RENT THAT IT IS THE VALUE OF THE SURPLUS OR NET PRODUCT OF AN ECONOMIC AGENT LEAVING THE AGENT ITSELF UNIMPAIRED IN EFFICIENCY
7994-258960-0026 THE TOTAL PRODUCT IS SOMETIMES CALLED THE GROSS RENT BUT ECONOMIC RENT IS NET RENT THIS THOUGHT IS MADE CLEARER BY THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION
7994-258960-0027 ONE ECONOMIC RENT LIKEWISE CALLED NATURAL COMPETITIVE AND SOMETIMES RACK RENT IS TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM CONTRACT RENT ECONOMIC RENT IS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE USUFRUCT
7994-258960-0028 AND CONTRACT RENT IS THE AMOUNT A MAN PAYS FOR THE USE OF WEALTH BY VIRTUE OF AN EXISTING AGREEMENT THE ONE IS IMPERSONAL OR ECONOMIC THE OTHER IS PERSONAL OR LEGAL BEING FIXED BY AGREEMENTS BETWEEN PERSONS
7994-258960-0029 THE RENTS USUALLY SPOKEN OF ARE CONTRACT RENTS
7994-258960-0030 IF THE CONTRACT HAS BEEN LATELY MADE THE TWO WILL BE NEARLY THE SAME CONTRACTS OF LONG STANDING OFTEN BIND THE TENANT OR BORROWER TO PAY EITHER MORE OR LESS THAN THE PRESENT COMPETITIVE PRICE IF AFTER A TIME
7994-258960-0031 THE VALUE OF THE USE IS GREATER THAN THE CONTRACT RENT THE TENANT IS FORTUNATE IN HAVING HIS LEASE BUT HE IS THE LOSER IF HE IS BOUND BY LEASE OR AGREEMENT TO PAY RENT IN A LOCALITY WHERE LAND HAS BECOME LESS VALUABLE
7994-258960-0032 CUSTOM MAY PREVENT THE OWNER FROM CHARGING ALL THE USUFRUCT OF THE AGENT IS WORTH IF THE CONTRACT RENT IS LESS THAN THE ECONOMIC RENT EVIDENTLY THE BORROWER ENJOYS A PART OF THE USUFRUCT WITHOUT CHARGE
7994-258960-0033 PROSPECTIVE HIRERS OF AGENTS FORECAST WHAT THE USE WILL BE WORTH TO THEM
7994-258960-0034 THE FORM OF THE RENTING CONTRACT IS OBSERVED BY MEN IN ESTIMATING THE USES OF THEIR OWN WEALTH WHERE NO CONTRACT EXISTS IF THEY COUNT THE GROSS PRODUCT OF AN AGENT AS RENT IT IS BAD BOOKKEEPING IN MANY CASES IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE
7994-258960-0035 LAND IS NOT RECOGNIZED AS WEALTH TO BE EXCHANGED OR OWNED BUT AT A LATER STAGE AS IN THE MIDDLE AGES IN EUROPE LAND AND THE THINGS PERTAINING TO IT AS DITCHES HOUSES MILLS CATTLE STOCK
7994-258960-0036 AND THE FEW SIMPLE IMPLEMENTS CONSTITUTED THE LARGER PORTION OF THE WEALTH LAND WAS GRANTED TO THE TENANT OR SERF IN RETURN FOR SERVICES THE CONTRACT WAS PRETTY STRICTLY DRAWN AND ALL ITEMS WERE SPECIFIED
7994-258960-0037 IT WAS NOT HARD TO HOLD THE TENANT TO HIS CONTRACT TO KEEP THE LAND IN ABOUT THE SAME CONDITION THERE WAS A CERTAIN ROTATION OF CROPS THE TENANT WAS OBLIGED TO KEEP HIS STOCK UP TO STANDARD AND MOREOVER HE HAD A CERTAIN INTEREST IN THE LAND
7994-258960-0038 BECAUSE HIS CONTRACT RENT AS EXPLAINED ABOVE WAS LESS THAN THE ECONOMIC RENT THE LANDLORD THEREFORE COULD COUNT PRETTY SURELY ON THE UNDIMINISHED POWER OF HIS LAND AND STOCK FROM ONE YEAR TO ANOTHER AT THAT TIME
7994-258960-0039 TRUCK AND BARTER WERE THE COMMON MODES OF EXCHANGE AND RENTS WERE PAID IN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES NOT IN MONEY THE FRUITS OF THE SOIL WERE CONSUMED ON THE SPOT INSTEAD OF BEING SOLD AS NOW LAND WAS RARELY IF EVER SOLD OUTRIGHT
7994-258960-0040 SO THAT THERE WAS NO OCCASION TO ESTIMATE ITS TOTAL SELLING VALUE IT WAS THOUGHT OF AS A PLACE ON WHICH TO LIVE
7994-258960-0041 ITS YEARLY USE WAS ALL THAT WAS SUBJECT TO CONTRACT SALE AND EXCHANGE NOT THE LAND ITSELF BUT A RENT CHARGE ON THE LAND WAS SOLD
7994-258960-0042 MANY MEDIEVAL ESTATES WERE SO TIED UP BY LEGAL CONDITIONS THAT THEY COULD NOT BE SOLD OUTRIGHT ALL THAT THE OWNER COULD DO WAS TO SELL OR MORTGAGE THE ANNUAL RENTAL THUS IN THE MIDDLE AGES
7994-258960-0043 IT WAS ALL BUT UNIVERSAL TO LOOK UPON MOST INDIRECT AGENTS AS EXCHANGEABLE ONLY UNDER THE RENTING CONTRACT AS SUBJECT TO RENTING
7994-258960-0044 FOUR AS INDUSTRY DEVELOPED THE RENTING CONTRACT REMAINED ALMOST WHOLLY CONFINED TO CASES OF RENTING LANDS AND HOUSES THE MATERIALS AND APPLIANCES NEEDED FOR MANUFACTURE AND COMMERCE ARE SO MANIFOLD AND VARYING IN QUALITY
7994-258960-0045 THAT THE RENT FORM OF CONTRACT IS VERY CUMBERSOME AND DIFFICULT FOR EXCHANGERS TO ENFORCE IF A MERCHANT ABOUT TO EMBARK ON A TRADING JOURNEY WISHED TO RENT A SHIP AND A STOCK OF GOODS
7994-258960-0046 HE MUST AGREE TO REPAY THE LOAN IN GOODS OF THE SAME KIND AND QUALITY AS THOSE RECEIVED A CONTRACT MOST DIFFICULT TO EXECUTE AND GIVING OCCASION TO COSTLY TESTS AND COUNTLESS DISAGREEMENTS
7994-258960-0047 IT WAS MUCH EASIER FOR THE MERCHANT TO GET HIS LOAN UNDER THE INTEREST CONTRACT
7994-258960-0048 A MONEY LOAN WITH WHICH TO BUY THE GOODS WITH THE GROWTH OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE WEALTH INCREASED IN TOWNS TAKING MANY FORMS AS THOSE OF SHIPS WAGONS TOOLS AND STOCKS OF GOODS
7994-258960-0049 IN ENGLAND THE COUNTRY WHICH DEVELOPED ITS INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM EARLIEST THE IDEA OF RENT THEREFORE GRADUALLY BECAME DISASSOCIATED ALMOST ENTIRELY FROM THE USE OR HIRE OF ANY WEALTH BUT LAND AND REAL PROPERTY
7994-258960-0050 BECAUSE IN THE MIDDLE AGES RENT WAS ASSOCIATED ALMOST ENTIRELY WITH NATURAL RESOURCES THEY BEING THE ONLY IMPORTANT FORMS OF WEALTH WHICH MEN RENTED FROM OTHERS THERE WAS FOSTERED THE IDEA THAT THE ESSENTIAL MARK OF RENT
7994-258960-0051 IS THE CONNECTION WITH NATURAL RESOURCES IT IS A SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF THE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS IN THE TRANSFER OR LOAN OF MOVABLE GOODS THE RENT CONTRACT WAS QUITE OVERSHADOWED BY THE OTHER FORM OF CONTRACT THAT OF A MONEY LOAN
7994-258960-0052 ACCORDING TO THIS EXPLANATION THE ESSENTIAL AND PRIMARY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RENTING WEALTH AND BORROWING MONEY AT INTEREST IS NOT IN THE KIND OF WEALTH WHOSE USE IS THUS TEMPORARILY TRANSFERRED BUT IN THE NATURE OF THE CONTRACT
7994-258960-0053 BUT AS FORMS OF WEALTH DIFFER IN THEIR FITNESS FOR TRANSFER UNDER THE TWO FORMS OF CONTRACT THERE GOES ON A COMPETITION BETWEEN THEM AS A RESULT OF WHICH EACH BECOMES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN GROUPS OF GOODS IN THE MIDDLE AGES
7994-258960-0054 THE RENTING CONTRACT WAS THE DOMINANT FORM BUT IT HAS BEEN PROGRESSIVELY DISPLACED BY LOANS IN THE MONEY FORM
7994-258960-0055 FIVE THE MAIN FORMS OF WEALTH WHOSE USUFRUCT IS STILL SOLD UNDER LONG RENTING CONTRACTS ARE LAND AND ITS MORE DURABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN ENGLAND FARMS ARE LET UNDER LONG LEASES A VERY COMMON FORM BEING THE THIRTY YEAR LEASE
7994-258960-0056 UNDER THE OLD ALMOST FIXED CONDITIONS IN AGRICULTURE SUCH A LEASE WAS EQUITABLE BUT WHEN PRICES ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING AND WHEN NEW METHODS ARE BEING INTRODUCED IT GIVES RISE TO GREAT HARDSHIPS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO
7994-258960-0057 IN AMERICA FARMS ARE LET USUALLY ON SHARES AND FROM YEAR TO YEAR BUT THE PLAN OF A MONEY RENT IS INCREASINGLY FOLLOWED THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING AN EQUITABLE ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN LANDLORD AND TENANT IS RECOGNIZED BY ALL
7994-258960-0058 HE MUST SPECIFY IN THE CONTRACT WHETHER THE PRODUCTS CAN BE TAKEN AWAY OR ARE TO BE FED ON THE PLACE SO THAT THE SOIL MAY NOT BE IMPOVERISHED AND HE MUST PROVIDE FOR THE PURCHASE OF OTHER FERTILIZERS
7994-258960-0059 ON THE OTHER HAND THE TENANT UNDER THE RENTING CONTRACT HAS LITTLE MOTIVE FOR IMPROVEMENT AND MANY OCCASIONS FOR DISCONTENT SO IN AMERICA FAR MORE THAN IN THE OLDER COUNTRIES LAND CHANGES HANDS BY SALE
7994-258960-0060 THE PURCHASER GOING INTO DEBT FOR IT GIVING HIS NOTE AND PAYING INTEREST ON THE LOAN
7994-258960-0061 MANY LESS DURABLE GOODS ARE RENTED FOR BRIEF PERIODS CARRIAGES ARE RENTED FOR THE DAY BICYCLES BY THE WEEK OR MONTH SEWING MACHINES BOATS GUNS TENTS AND EVEN DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RINGS
7994-258960-0062 YIELD THEIR JOYS UNDER THE RENTING CONTRACT PEOPLE FREQUENTLY HESITATE BETWEEN THE RENTING AND THE PURCHASE OF A PIANO AND IN SOME CASES RENTING IS THE MORE CONVENIENT AND DESIRABLE WAY OF SECURING ITS USE THE PURCHASE OF A DRESS COAT
7994-258960-0063 OR OF A MASQUERADE SUIT TO BE WORN BUT ONCE INVOLVES FOR SOME AN EXCESSIVE AND NEEDLESS SACRIFICE FOR A MODERATE SUM ITS TEMPORARY USE MAY BE HAD AND IT IS THEN RETURNED LITTLE THE WORSE FOR WEAR
7994-258960-0064 A FINAL WORD OF CAUTION MAY BE GIVEN ECONOMIC RENT IS NOT CONFINED TO THE CASES OF CONTRACT RENT IT EXISTS IN EVERY CASE WHERE A MORE OR LESS DURABLE AGENT YIELDS A USE THAT IS SCARCE AND DESIRABLE
7994-258960-0065 THE OWNER WHO USES A THING HIMSELF GETS THE ADVANTAGE IN THE PRODUCT AS CLEARLY AS IF HE COLLECTED RENT FROM A BORROWER HOUSES LIVED IN BY THE OWNERS
7994-258960-0066 CLOTHING BOOKS ALL SCARCE AND DURABLE AGENTS ARE YIELDING RENTS IN THIS LOGICAL SENSE TO THE ECONOMIST THEREFORE THE PROBLEM OF ECONOMIC RENT AS ONE OF THE GRAND DIVISIONS OF THE PROBLEM OF VALUE
7994-258960-0067 REMAINS OF UNDIMINISHED IMPORTANCE FOR IN THESE UNCEASING STREAMS OF USES
