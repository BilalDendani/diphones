6567-53342-0000 NO SCREECH OWLE STIR A WING ABOUT THY SEPULCHRE NO BOYSTEROUS WINDS OR STORMES COME HITHER TO STARVE OR WITHER THY SOFT SWEET EARTH BUT LIKE A SPRING
6567-53342-0001 LOVE KEPT IT EVER FLOURISHING HERRICK IN THE COURSE OF AN EXCURSION THROUGH ONE OF THE REMOTE COUNTIES OF ENGLAND
6567-53342-0002 I HAD STRUCK INTO ONE OF THOSE CROSS ROADS THAT LEAD THROUGH THE MORE SECLUDED PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND STOPPED ONE AFTERNOON AT A VILLAGE THE SITUATION OF WHICH WAS BEAUTIFULLY RURAL AND RETIRED
6567-53342-0003 THERE WAS AN AIR OF PRIMITIVE SIMPLICITY ABOUT ITS INHABITANTS NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE VILLAGES WHICH LIE ON THE GREAT COACH ROADS I DETERMINED TO PASS THE NIGHT THERE AND HAVING TAKEN AN EARLY DINNER
6567-53342-0004 STROLLED OUT TO ENJOY THE NEIGHBORING SCENERY MY RAMBLE AS IS USUALLY THE CASE WITH TRAVELLERS SOON LED ME TO THE CHURCH WHICH STOOD AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE VILLAGE INDEED
6567-53342-0005 IT WAS AN OBJECT OF SOME CURIOSITY ITS OLD TOWER BEING COMPLETELY OVERRUN WITH IVY SO THAT ONLY HERE AND THERE A JUTTING BUTTRESS AN ANGLE OF GRAY WALL
6567-53342-0006 OR A FANTASTICALLY CARVED ORNAMENT PEERED THROUGH THE VERDANT COVERING IT WAS A LOVELY EVENING THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY HAD BEEN DARK AND SHOWERY BUT
6567-53342-0007 IN THE AFTERNOON IT HAD CLEARED UP AND THOUGH SULLEN CLOUDS STILL HUNG OVERHEAD YET THERE WAS A BROAD TRACT OF GOLDEN SKY IN THE WEST FROM WHICH THE SETTING SUN GLEAMED THROUGH THE DRIPPING LEAVES
6567-53342-0008 AND LIT UP ALL NATURE INTO A MELANCHOLY SMILE IT SEEMED LIKE THE PARTING HOUR OF A GOOD CHRISTIAN SMILING ON THE SINS AND SORROWS OF THE WORLD AND GIVING
6567-53342-0009 IN THE SERENITY OF HIS DECLINE AN ASSURANCE THAT HE WILL RISE AGAIN IN GLORY I HAD SEATED MYSELF ON A HALF SUNKEN TOMBSTONE
6567-53342-0010 AND WAS MUSING AS ONE IS APT TO DO AT THIS SOBER THOUGHTED HOUR ON PAST SCENES AND EARLY FRIENDS ON THOSE WHO WERE DISTANT AND THOSE WHO WERE DEAD
6567-53342-0011 AND INDULGING IN THAT KIND OF MELANCHOLY FANCYING WHICH HAS IN IT SOMETHING SWEETER EVEN THAN PLEASURE EVERY NOW AND THEN THE STROKE OF A BELL FROM THE NEIGHBORING TOWER FELL ON MY EAR
6567-53342-0012 AND IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE I RECOLLECTED THAT IT MUST BE TOLLING THE KNELL OF SOME NEW TENANT OF THE TOMB PRESENTLY I SAW A FUNERAL TRAIN MOVING ACROSS THE VILLAGE GREEN
6567-53342-0013 IT WOUND SLOWLY ALONG A LANE WAS LOST AND REAPPEARED THROUGH THE BREAKS OF THE HEDGES UNTIL IT PASSED THE PLACE WHERE I WAS SITTING THE PALL WAS SUPPORTED BY YOUNG GIRLS DRESSED IN WHITE
6567-53342-0014 AND ANOTHER ABOUT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN WALKED BEFORE BEARING A CHAPLET OF WHITE FLOWERS A TOKEN THAT THE DECEASED WAS A YOUNG AND UNMARRIED FEMALE
6567-53342-0015 THE CORPSE WAS FOLLOWED BY THE PARENTS THEY WERE A VENERABLE COUPLE OF THE BETTER ORDER OF PEASANTRY THE FATHER SEEMED TO REPRESS HIS FEELINGS BUT HIS FIXED EYE
6567-53342-0016 CONTRACTED BROW AND DEEPLY FURROWED FACE SHOWED THE STRUGGLE THAT WAS PASSING WITHIN HIS WIFE HUNG ON HIS ARM AND WEPT ALOUD WITH THE CONVULSIVE BURSTS OF A MOTHER'S SORROW
6567-53342-0017 I FOLLOWED THE FUNERAL INTO THE CHURCH THE BIER WAS PLACED IN THE CENTRE AISLE AND THE CHAPLET OF WHITE FLOWERS WITH A PAIR OF WHITE GLOVES WAS HUNG OVER THE SEAT WHICH THE DECEASED HAD OCCUPIED
6567-53342-0018 FOR WHO IS SO FORTUNATE AS NEVER TO HAVE FOLLOWED SOME ONE HE HAS LOVED TO THE TOMB BUT WHEN PERFORMED OVER THE REMAINS OF INNOCENCE AND BEAUTY THUS LAID LOW IN THE BLOOM OF EXISTENCE
6567-53342-0019 WHAT CAN BE MORE AFFECTING AT THAT SIMPLE BUT MOST SOLEMN CONSIGNMENT OF THE BODY TO THE GRAVE EARTH TO EARTH ASHES TO ASHES DUST TO DUST
6567-53342-0020 THE TEARS OF THE YOUTHFUL COMPANIONS OF THE DECEASED FLOWED UNRESTRAINED THE FATHER STILL SEEMED TO STRUGGLE WITH HIS FEELINGS
6567-53342-0021 BUT THE MOTHER ONLY THOUGHT OF HER CHILD AS A FLOWER OF THE FIELD CUT DOWN AND WITHERED IN THE MIDST OF ITS SWEETNESS
6567-53342-0022 MOURNING OVER HER CHILDREN AND WOULD NOT BE COMFORTED ON RETURNING TO THE INN I LEARNT THE WHOLE STORY OF THE DECEASED IT WAS A SIMPLE ONE
6567-53342-0023 AND SUCH AS HAS OFTEN BEEN TOLD SHE HAD BEEN THE BEAUTY AND PRIDE OF THE VILLAGE HER FATHER HAD ONCE BEEN AN OPULENT FARMER BUT WAS REDUCED IN CIRCUMSTANCES
6567-53342-0024 THE GOOD MAN WATCHED OVER HER EDUCATION WITH PATERNAL CARE IT WAS LIMITED AND SUITABLE TO THE SPHERE IN WHICH SHE WAS TO MOVE FOR HE ONLY SOUGHT TO MAKE HER AN ORNAMENT TO HER STATION IN LIFE
6567-53342-0025 NOT TO RAISE HER ABOVE IT THE TENDERNESS AND INDULGENCE OF HER PARENTS AND THE EXEMPTION FROM ALL ORDINARY OCCUPATIONS HAD FOSTERED A NATURAL GRACE AND DELICACY OF CHARACTER
6567-53342-0026 SHE APPEARED LIKE SOME TENDER PLANT OF THE GARDEN BLOOMING ACCIDENTALLY AMID THE HARDIER NATIVES OF THE FIELDS
6567-53342-0027 THE SUPERIORITY OF HER CHARMS WAS FELT AND ACKNOWLEDGED BY HER COMPANIONS BUT WITHOUT ENVY
6567-53342-0028 FOR IT WAS SURPASSED BY THE UNASSUMING GENTLENESS AND WINNING KINDNESS OF HER MANNERS IT MIGHT BE TRULY SAID OF HER THIS IS THE PRETTIEST LOW BORN LASS THAT EVER RAN ON THE GREEN SWARD
6567-53342-0029 NOTHING SHE DOES OR SEEMS BUT SMACKS OF SOMETHING GREATER THAN HERSELF TOO NOBLE FOR THIS PLACE THE VILLAGE WAS ONE OF THOSE SEQUESTERED SPOTS
6567-53342-0030 WHICH STILL RETAIN SOME VESTIGES OF OLD ENGLISH CUSTOMS IT HAD ITS RURAL FESTIVALS AND HOLIDAY PASTIMES AND STILL KEPT UP SOME FAINT OBSERVANCE OF THE ONCE POPULAR RITES OF MAY
6567-53342-0031 THESE INDEED HAD BEEN PROMOTED BY ITS PRESENT PASTOR WHO WAS A LOVER OF OLD CUSTOMS AND ONE OF THOSE SIMPLE CHRISTIANS THAT THINK THEIR MISSION FULFILLED BY PROMOTING JOY ON EARTH
6567-53342-0032 AND GOOD WILL AMONG MANKIND UNDER HIS AUSPICES THE MAY POLE STOOD FROM YEAR TO YEAR IN THE CENTRE OF THE VILLAGE GREEN ON MAYDAY IT WAS DECORATED WITH GARLANDS AND STREAMERS
6567-53342-0033 AND A QUEEN OR LADY OF THE MAY WAS APPOINTED AS IN FORMER TIMES TO PRESIDE AT THE SPORTS AND DISTRIBUTE THE PRIZES AND REWARDS
6567-53342-0034 WOULD OFTEN ATTRACT THE NOTICE OF CASUAL VISITORS AMONG THESE ON ONE MAY DAY WAS A YOUNG OFFICER WHOSE REGIMENT HAD BEEN RECENTLY QUARTERED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
6567-53342-0035 HE WAS CHARMED WITH THE NATIVE TASTE THAT PERVADED THIS VILLAGE PAGEANT BUT ABOVE ALL WITH THE DAWNING LOVELINESS OF THE QUEEN OF MAY
6567-53342-0036 IT WAS THE VILLAGE FAVORITE WHO WAS CROWNED WITH FLOWERS AND BLUSHING AND SMILING IN ALL THE BEAUTIFUL CONFUSION OF GIRLISH DIFFIDENCE AND DELIGHT
6567-53342-0037 THE ARTLESSNESS OF RURAL HABITS ENABLED HIM READILY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE HE GRADUALLY WON HIS WAY INTO HER INTIMACY
6567-53342-0038 AND PAID HIS COURT TO HER IN THAT UNTHINKING WAY IN WHICH YOUNG OFFICERS ARE TOO APT TO TRIFLE WITH RUSTIC SIMPLICITY THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS ADVANCES TO STARTLE OR ALARM
6567-53342-0039 HE NEVER EVEN TALKED OF LOVE BUT THERE ARE MODES OF MAKING IT MORE ELOQUENT THAN LANGUAGE AND WHICH CONVEY IT SUBTILELY AND IRRESISTIBLY TO THE HEART
6567-53342-0040 THE TONE OF VOICE THE THOUSAND TENDERNESSES WHICH EMANATE FROM EVERY WORD AND LOOK AND ACTION THESE FORM THE TRUE ELOQUENCE OF LOVE
6567-53342-0041 BUT NEVER DESCRIBED CAN WE WONDER THAT THEY SHOULD READILY WIN A HEART YOUNG GUILELESS AND SUSCEPTIBLE AS TO HER SHE LOVED ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY
6567-53342-0042 SHE SCARCELY INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE GROWING PASSION THAT WAS ABSORBING EVERY THOUGHT AND FEELING OR WHAT WERE TO BE ITS CONSEQUENCES SHE INDEED
6567-53342-0043 LOOKED NOT TO THE FUTURE WHEN PRESENT HIS LOOKS AND WORDS OCCUPIED HER WHOLE ATTENTION WHEN ABSENT SHE THOUGHT BUT OF WHAT HAD PASSED AT THEIR RECENT INTERVIEW
6567-53342-0044 SHE WOULD WANDER WITH HIM THROUGH THE GREEN LANES AND RURAL SCENES OF THE VICINITY
6567-53342-0045 HE TALKED IN THE LANGUAGE OF POLITE AND CULTIVATED LIFE AND BREATHED INTO HER EAR THE WITCHERIES OF ROMANCE AND POETRY
6567-53342-0046 PERHAPS THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A PASSION BETWEEN THE SEXES MORE PURE THAN THIS INNOCENT GIRL'S THE GALLANT FIGURE OF HER YOUTHFUL ADMIRER AND THE SPLENDOR OF HIS MILITARY ATTIRE
6567-53342-0047 MIGHT AT FIRST HAVE CHARMED HER EYE BUT IT WAS NOT THESE THAT HAD CAPTIVATED HER HEART HER ATTACHMENT HAD SOMETHING IN IT OF IDOLATRY
6567-53342-0048 SHE LOOKED UP TO HIM AS TO A BEING OF A SUPERIOR ORDER SHE FELT IN HIS SOCIETY THE ENTHUSIASM OF A MIND NATURALLY DELICATE AND POETICAL
6567-53342-0049 AND NOW FIRST AWAKENED TO A KEEN PERCEPTION OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND GRAND OF THE SORDID DISTINCTIONS OF RANK AND FORTUNE SHE THOUGHT NOTHING IT WAS THE DIFFERENCE OF INTELLECT
6567-53342-0050 OF DEMEANOR OF MANNERS FROM THOSE OF THE RUSTIC SOCIETY TO WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED THAT ELEVATED HIM IN HER OPINION SHE WOULD LISTEN TO HIM WITH CHARMED EAR
6567-53342-0051 AND DOWNCAST LOOK OF MUTE DELIGHT AND HER CHEEK WOULD MANTLE WITH ENTHUSIASM OR IF EVER SHE VENTURED A SHY GLANCE OF TIMID ADMIRATION IT WAS AS QUICKLY WITHDRAWN
6567-53342-0052 AND SHE WOULD SIGH AND BLUSH AT THE IDEA OF HER COMPARATIVE UNWORTHINESS HER LOVER WAS EQUALLY IMPASSIONED BUT HIS PASSION WAS MINGLED WITH FEELINGS OF A COARSER NATURE
6567-53342-0053 HE HAD BEGUN THE CONNECTION IN LEVITY FOR HE HAD OFTEN HEARD HIS BROTHER OFFICERS BOAST OF THEIR VILLAGE CONQUESTS
6567-53342-0054 AND THOUGHT SOME TRIUMPH OF THE KIND NECESSARY TO HIS REPUTATION AS A MAN OF SPIRIT BUT HE WAS TOO FULL OF YOUTHFUL FERVOR
6567-53342-0055 THERE WERE THE OLD OBSTACLES WHICH SO INCESSANTLY OCCUR IN THESE HEEDLESS ATTACHMENTS HIS RANK IN LIFE THE PREJUDICES OF TITLED CONNECTIONS
6567-53342-0056 HIS DEPENDENCE UPON A PROUD AND UNYIELDING FATHER ALL FORBADE HIM TO THINK OF MATRIMONY BUT WHEN HE LOOKED DOWN UPON THIS INNOCENT BEING
6567-53342-0057 SO TENDER AND CONFIDING THERE WAS A PURITY IN HER MANNERS A BLAMELESSNESS IN HER LIFE
6567-53342-0058 AND TO CHILL THE GLOW OF GENEROUS SENTIMENT WITH THAT COLD DERISIVE LEVITY WITH WHICH HE HAD HEARD THEM TALK OF FEMALE VIRTUE WHENEVER HE CAME INTO HER PRESENCE
6567-53342-0059 SHE WAS STILL SURROUNDED BY THAT MYSTERIOUS BUT IMPASSIVE CHARM OF VIRGIN PURITY IN WHOSE HALLOWED SPHERE NO GUILTY THOUGHT CAN LIVE
6567-53342-0060 HE REMAINED FOR A SHORT TIME IN A STATE OF THE MOST PAINFUL IRRESOLUTION HE HESITATED TO COMMUNICATE THE TIDINGS UNTIL THE DAY FOR MARCHING WAS AT HAND
6567-53342-0061 WHEN HE GAVE HER THE INTELLIGENCE IN THE COURSE OF AN EVENING RAMBLE THE IDEA OF PARTING HAD NEVER BEFORE OCCURRED TO HER IT BROKE IN AT ONCE UPON HER DREAM OF FELICITY
6567-53342-0062 SHE LOOKED UPON IT AS A SUDDEN AND INSURMOUNTABLE EVIL AND WEPT WITH THE GUILELESS SIMPLICITY OF A CHILD HE DREW HER TO HIS BOSOM AND KISSED THE TEARS FROM HER SOFT CHEEK
6567-53342-0063 NOR DID HE MEET WITH A REPULSE FOR THERE ARE MOMENTS OF MINGLED SORROW AND TENDERNESS WHICH HALLOW THE CARESSES OF AFFECTION HE WAS NATURALLY IMPETUOUS
6567-53342-0064 AND THE SIGHT OF BEAUTY APPARENTLY YIELDING IN HIS ARMS THE CONFIDENCE OF HIS POWER OVER HER AND THE DREAD OF LOSING HER FOREVER ALL CONSPIRED TO OVERWHELM HIS BETTER FEELINGS
6567-53342-0065 HE VENTURED TO PROPOSE THAT SHE SHOULD LEAVE HER HOME AND BE THE COMPANION OF HIS FORTUNES HE WAS QUITE A NOVICE IN SEDUCTION AND BLUSHED AND FALTERED AT HIS OWN BASENESS
6567-53342-0066 BUT SO INNOCENT OF MIND WAS HIS INTENDED VICTIM THAT SHE WAS AT FIRST AT A LOSS TO COMPREHEND HIS MEANING AND WHY SHE SHOULD LEAVE HER NATIVE VILLAGE
6567-53342-0067 AND THE HUMBLE ROOF OF HER PARENTS WHEN AT LAST THE NATURE OF HIS PROPOSAL FLASHED UPON HER PURE MIND THE EFFECT WAS WITHERING SHE DID NOT WEEP
6567-53342-0068 SHE DID NOT BREAK FORTH INTO REPROACH SHE SAID NOT A WORD BUT SHE SHRUNK BACK AGHAST AS FROM A VIPER GAVE HIM A LOOK OF ANGUISH THAT PIERCED TO HIS VERY SOUL AND
6567-53342-0069 CLASPING HER HANDS IN AGONY FLED AS IF FOR REFUGE TO HER FATHER'S COTTAGE THE OFFICER RETIRED CONFOUNDED HUMILIATED AND REPENTANT
6567-53342-0070 IT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE RESULT OF THE CONFLICT OF HIS FEELINGS HAD NOT HIS THOUGHTS BEEN DIVERTED BY THE BUSTLE OF DEPARTURE NEW SCENES NEW PLEASURES
6567-53342-0071 AND NEW COMPANIONS SOON DISSIPATED HIS SELF REPROACH AND STIFLED HIS TENDERNESS YET AMIDST THE STIR OF CAMPS THE REVELRIES OF GARRISONS
6567-53342-0072 THE ARRAY OF ARMIES AND EVEN THE DIN OF BATTLES HIS THOUGHTS WOULD SOMETIMES STEAL BACK TO THE SCENES OF RURAL QUIET AND VILLAGE SIMPLICITY THE WHITE COTTAGE
6567-53342-0073 THE FOOTPATH ALONG THE SILVER BROOK AND UP THE HAWTHORN HEDGE AND THE LITTLE VILLAGE MAID LOITERING ALONG IT LEANING ON HIS ARM
6567-53342-0074 AND LISTENING TO HIM WITH EYES BEAMING WITH UNCONSCIOUS AFFECTION THE SHOCK WHICH THE POOR GIRL HAD RECEIVED IN THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL HER IDEAL WORLD HAD INDEED BEEN CRUEL
6567-53342-0075 THE MARCH OF THE DEPARTING TROOPS SHE HAD SEEN HER FAITHLESS LOVER BORNE OFF AS IF IN TRIUMPH AMIDST THE SOUND OF DRUM AND TRUMPET AND THE POMP OF ARMS
6567-53342-0076 SHE STRAINED A LAST ACHING GAZE AFTER HIM AS THE MORNING SUN GLITTERED ABOUT HIS FIGURE AND HIS PLUME WAVED IN THE BREEZE
6567-53342-0077 HE PASSED AWAY LIKE A BRIGHT VISION FROM HER SIGHT AND LEFT HER ALL IN DARKNESS IT WOULD BE TRITE TO DWELL ON THE PARTICULARS OF HER AFTER STORY
6567-53342-0078 IT WAS LIKE OTHER TALES OF LOVE MELANCHOLY SHE AVOIDED SOCIETY AND WANDERED OUT ALONE IN THE WALKS SHE HAD MOST FREQUENTED WITH HER LOVER
6567-53342-0079 SHE SOUGHT LIKE THE STRICKEN DEER TO WEEP IN SILENCE AND LONELINESS AND BROOD OVER THE BARBED SORROW THAT RANKLED IN HER SOUL
6567-53342-0080 SOMETIMES SHE WOULD BE SEEN LATE OF AN EVENING SITTING IN THE PORCH OF THE VILLAGE CHURCH AND THE MILK MAIDS RETURNING FROM THE FIELDS WOULD NOW AND THEN OVERHEAR HER SINGING SOME PLAINTIVE DITTY IN THE HAWTHORN WALK
6567-53342-0081 SHE BECAME FERVENT IN HER DEVOTIONS AT CHURCH AND AS THE OLD PEOPLE SAW HER APPROACH SO WASTED AWAY YET WITH A HECTIC GLOOM AND THAT HALLOWED AIR WHICH MELANCHOLY DIFFUSES ROUND THE FORM
6567-53342-0082 AND LOOKING AFTER HER WOULD SHAKE THEIR HEADS IN GLOOMY FOREBODING SHE FELT A CONVICTION THAT SHE WAS HASTENING TO THE TOMB BUT LOOKED FORWARD TO IT AS A PLACE OF REST
6567-53342-0083 THE SILVER CORD THAT HAD BOUND HER TO EXISTENCE WAS LOOSED AND THERE SEEMED TO BE NO MORE PLEASURE UNDER THE SUN IF EVER HER GENTLE BOSOM HAD ENTERTAINED RESENTMENT AGAINST HER LOVER
6567-53342-0084 IT WAS EXTINGUISHED SHE WAS INCAPABLE OF ANGRY PASSIONS AND IN A MOMENT OF SADDENED TENDERNESS SHE PENNED HIM A FAREWELL LETTER
6567-53342-0085 BUT TOUCHING FROM ITS VERY SIMPLICITY SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE WAS DYING AND DID NOT CONCEAL FROM HIM THAT HIS CONDUCT WAS THE CAUSE
6567-53342-0086 SHE EVEN DEPICTED THE SUFFERINGS WHICH SHE HAD EXPERIENCED BUT CONCLUDED WITH SAYING THAT SHE COULD NOT DIE IN PEACE UNTIL SHE HAD SENT HIM HER FORGIVENESS
6567-53342-0087 AND HER BLESSING BY DEGREES HER STRENGTH DECLINED THAT SHE COULD NO LONGER LEAVE THE COTTAGE SHE COULD ONLY TOTTER TO THE WINDOW WHERE PROPPED UP IN HER CHAIR
6567-53342-0088 IT WAS HER ENJOYMENT TO SIT ALL DAY AND LOOK OUT UPON THE LANDSCAPE STILL SHE UTTERED NO COMPLAINT NOR IMPARTED TO ANY ONE THE MALADY THAT WAS PREYING ON HER HEART
6567-53342-0089 SHE NEVER EVEN MENTIONED HER LOVER'S NAME BUT WOULD LAY HER HEAD ON HER MOTHER'S BOSOM AND WEEP IN SILENCE
6567-53342-0090 HER POOR PARENTS HUNG IN MUTE ANXIETY OVER THIS FADING BLOSSOM OF THEIR HOPES STILL FLATTERING THEMSELVES THAT IT MIGHT AGAIN REVIVE TO FRESHNESS AND THAT THE BRIGHT UNEARTHLY BLOOM WHICH SOMETIMES FLUSHED HER CHEEK
6567-53342-0091 MIGHT BE THE PROMISE OF RETURNING HEALTH IN THIS WAY SHE WAS SEATED BETWEEN THEM ONE SUNDAY AFTERNOON HER HANDS WERE CLASPED IN THEIRS THE LATTICE WAS THROWN OPEN
6567-53342-0092 AND THE SOFT AIR THAT STOLE IN BROUGHT WITH IT THE FRAGRANCE OF THE CLUSTERING HONEYSUCKLE WHICH HER OWN HANDS HAD TRAINED ROUND THE WINDOW HER FATHER HAD JUST BEEN READING A CHAPTER IN THE BIBLE
6567-53342-0093 IT SPOKE OF THE VANITY OF WORLDLY THINGS AND OF THE JOYS OF HEAVEN IT SEEMED TO HAVE DIFFUSED COMFORT AND SERENITY THROUGH HER BOSOM
6567-53342-0094 THE BELL HAD TOLLED FOR THE EVENING SERVICE THE LAST VILLAGER WAS LAGGING INTO THE PORCH AND EVERYTHING HAD SUNK INTO THAT HALLOWED STILLNESS PECULIAR TO THE DAY OF REST
6567-53342-0095 HER PARENTS WERE GAZING ON HER WITH YEARNING HEARTS SICKNESS AND SORROW WHICH PASS SO ROUGHLY OVER SOME FACES HAD GIVEN TO HERS THE EXPRESSION OF A SERAPH'S
6567-53342-0096 A TEAR TREMBLED IN HER SOFT BLUE EYE WAS SHE THINKING OF HER FAITHLESS LOVER OR WERE HER THOUGHTS WANDERING TO THAT DISTANT CHURCHYARD
6567-53342-0097 INTO WHOSE BOSOM SHE MIGHT SOON BE GATHERED SUDDENLY THE CLANG OF HOOFS WAS HEARD A HORSEMAN GALLOPED TO THE COTTAGE HE DISMOUNTED BEFORE THE WINDOW
6567-53342-0098 THE POOR GIRL GAVE A FAINT EXCLAMATION AND SUNK BACK IN HER CHAIR IT WAS HER REPENTANT LOVER HE RUSHED INTO THE HOUSE AND FLEW TO CLASP HER TO HIS BOSOM
6567-53342-0099 BUT HER WASTED FORM HER DEATHLIKE COUNTENANCE SO WAN YET SO LOVELY IN ITS DESOLATION SMOTE HIM TO THE SOUL AND HE THREW HIMSELF IN AGONY AT HER FEET
6567-53342-0100 SHE WAS TOO FAINT TO RISE SHE ATTEMPTED TO EXTEND HER TREMBLING HAND HER LIPS MOVED AS IF SHE SPOKE
6567-53342-0101 BUT NO WORD WAS ARTICULATED SHE LOOKED DOWN UPON HIM
6567-53342-0102 AND CLOSED HER EYES FOREVER SUCH ARE THE PARTICULARS WHICH I GATHERED OF THIS VILLAGE STORY THEY ARE BUT SCANTY
6567-53342-0103 AND I AM CONSCIOUS HAVE LITTLE NOVELTY TO RECOMMEND THEM IN THE PRESENT RAGE ALSO FOR STRANGE INCIDENT AND HIGH SEASONED NARRATIVE THEY MAY APPEAR TRITE AND INSIGNIFICANT
6567-53342-0104 BUT THEY INTERESTED ME STRONGLY AT THE TIME AND TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE AFFECTING CEREMONY WHICH I HAD JUST WITNESSED LEFT A DEEPER IMPRESSION ON MY MIND
6567-53342-0105 THAN MANY CIRCUMSTANCES OF A MORE STRIKING NATURE I HAVE PASSED THROUGH THE PLACE SINCE AND VISITED THE CHURCH AGAIN FROM A BETTER MOTIVE THAN MERE CURIOSITY
6567-53342-0106 IT WAS A WINTRY EVENING THE TREES WERE STRIPPED OF THEIR FOLIAGE THE CHURCHYARD LOOKED NAKED AND MOURNFUL AND THE WIND RUSTLED COLDLY THROUGH THE DRY GRASS EVERGREENS HOWEVER
6567-53342-0107 HAD BEEN PLANTED ABOUT THE GRAVE OF THE VILLAGE FAVORITE
6567-53342-0108 THE CHURCH DOOR WAS OPEN AND I STEPPED IN THERE HUNG THE CHAPLET OF FLOWERS AND THE GLOVES AS ON THE DAY OF THE FUNERAL THE FLOWERS WERE WITHERED IT IS TRUE
6567-53342-0109 BUT CARE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN THAT NO DUST SHOULD SOIL THEIR WHITENESS I HAVE SEEN MANY MONUMENTS WHERE ART HAS EXHAUSTED ITS POWERS TO AWAKEN THE SYMPATHY OF THE SPECTATOR
6567-53342-0110 BUT I HAVE MET WITH NONE THAT SPOKE MORE TOUCHINGLY TO MY HEART
