8786-276735-0000 THE PROCLAMATION FOR SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEN BY PRESIDENT LINCOLN FURTHER EXAMINED THE REASONS PRESENTED BY HIM TO MANKIND FOR THE JUSTIFICATION OF HIS CONDUCT SHOWN TO BE MERE FICTIONS HAVING NO RELATION TO THE QUESTION
8786-276735-0001 WHAT IS THE VALUE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTY OF BILLS OF RIGHTS OF LIMITATIONS OF POWERS IF THEY MAY BE TRANSGRESSED AT PLEASURE SECESSION OF SOUTH CAROLINA PROCLAMATION OF BLOCKADE SESSION OF CONGRESS AT MONTGOMERY
8786-276735-0002 EXTRACTS FROM THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE ACTS OF CONGRESS SPIRIT OF THE PEOPLE SECESSION OF BORDER STATES DESTRUCTION OF UNITED STATES PROPERTY BY ORDER OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN
8786-276735-0003 IF ANY FURTHER EVIDENCE HAD BEEN REQUIRED TO SHOW THAT IT WAS THE DETERMINATION OF THE NORTHERN PEOPLE NOT ONLY TO MAKE NO CONCESSIONS TO THE GRIEVANCES OF THE SOUTHERN STATES BUT TO INCREASE THEM TO THE LAST EXTREMITY IT WAS FURNISHED BY THE PROCLAMATION OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN
8786-276735-0004 ISSUED ON APRIL FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE THIS PROCLAMATION WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED REQUIRES A FURTHER EXAMINATION
8786-276735-0005 OF THE WAR WHICH ENSUED IN IT THE PRESIDENT CALLED FOR SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEN TO SUPPRESS COMBINATIONS OPPOSED TO THE LAWS AND OBSTRUCTING THEIR EXECUTION IN SEVEN SOVEREIGN STATES WHICH HAD RETIRED FROM THE UNION
8786-276735-0006 SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEN ORGANIZED AND EQUIPPED ARE A POWERFUL ARMY AND WHEN RAISED TO OPERATE AGAINST THESE STATES NOTHING ELSE THAN WAR COULD BE INTENDED THE WORDS IN WHICH HE SUMMONED THIS FORCE WERE THESE
8786-276735-0007 WHEREAS THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN FOR SOME TIME PAST AND NOW ARE OPPOSED AND THE EXECUTION THEREOF OBSTRUCTED IN THE STATES OF SOUTH CAROLINA GEORGIA ALABAMA FLORIDA MISSISSIPPI LOUISIANA AND TEXAS
8786-276735-0008 BY COMBINATIONS TOO POWERFUL TO BE SUPPRESSED BY THE ORDINARY COURSE OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS OR BY THE POWERS VESTED IN THE MARSHALS BY LAW NOW THEREFORE I ABRAHAM LINCOLN BY VIRTUE OF THE POWER IN ME VESTED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND LAWS ET CETERA
8786-276735-0009 CANDIDATES FOR MEMBERSHIP WERE IMMEDIATELY NOMINATED ALL WERE IN FAVOR OF SECESSION THE CONVENTION ASSEMBLED ON DECEMBER SEVENTEENTH AND ON THE TWENTIETH PASSED AN ORDINANCE TO DISSOLVE THE UNION BETWEEN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND OTHER STATES UNITED WITH HER
8786-276735-0010 THE STATE AUTHORITIES IMMEDIATELY CONFORMED TO THIS ACTION OF THE CONVENTION AND THE LAWS AND AUTHORITY OF THE UNITED STATES CEASED TO BE OBEYED WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE STATE ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AFTERWARD WHEN THE STATE IN UNION WITH OTHERS WHICH HAD JOINED HER HAD POSSESSED HERSELF OF THE FORTS WITHIN HER LIMITS
8786-276735-0011 WHICH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAD REFUSED TO EVACUATE PRESIDENT LINCOLN ISSUED THE ABOVE MENTIONED PROCLAMATION THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA IS DESIGNATED IN THE PROCLAMATION AS A COMBINATION TOO POWERFUL TO BE SUPPRESSED BY THE ORDINARY COURSE OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS
8786-276735-0012 OR BY THE POWERS VESTED IN THE MARSHALS BY LAW THIS DESIGNATION DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE STATE OR MANIFEST ANY CONSCIOUSNESS OF ITS EXISTENCE WHEREAS SOUTH CAROLINA WAS ONE OF THE COLONIES THAT HAD DECLARED HER INDEPENDENCE AND AFTER A LONG AND BLOODY WAR
8786-276735-0013 SHE HAD BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A SOVEREIGN STATE BY GREAT BRITAIN THE ONLY POWER TO WHICH SHE HAD EVER OWED ALLEGIANCE THE FACT THAT SHE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE COLONIES IN THE ORIGINAL CONGRESS HAD BEEN A MEMBER OF THE CONFEDERATION AND SUBSEQUENTLY OF THE UNION
8786-276735-0014 STRENGTHENS BUT SURELY CAN NOT IMPAIR HER CLAIM TO BE A STATE THOUGH PRESIDENT LINCOLN DESIGNATED HER AS A COMBINATION IT DID NOT MAKE HER A COMBINATION THOUGH HE REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE HER AS A STATE IT DID NOT MAKE HER ANY LESS A STATE
8786-276735-0015 BY ASSERTION HE ATTEMPTED TO ANNIHILATE SEVEN STATES AND THE WAR WHICH FOLLOWED WAS TO ENFORCE THE REVOLUTIONARY EDICT AND TO ESTABLISH THE SUPREMACY OF THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT ON THE RUINS OF THE BLOOD BOUGHT INDEPENDENCE OF THE STATES
8786-276735-0016 BY DESIGNATING THE STATE AS A COMBINATION AND CONSIDERING THAT UNDER SUCH A NAME IT MIGHT BE IN A CONDITION OF INSURRECTION HE ASSUMED TO HAVE AUTHORITY TO RAISE A GREAT MILITARY FORCE AND ATTACK THE STATE YET EVEN IF THE FACT HAD BEEN AS ASSUMED
8786-276735-0017 IF AN INSURRECTION HAD EXISTED THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT LAWFULLY HAVE DERIVED THE POWER HE EXERCISED FROM SUCH CONDITION OF AFFAIRS THE PROVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION IS AS FOLLOWS THE UNITED STATES SHALL GUARANTEE TO EVERY STATE IN THIS UNION
8786-276735-0018 A REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND SHALL PROTECT EACH OF THEM AGAINST INVASION AND ON APPLICATION OF THE LEGISLATURE OR OF THE EXECUTIVE WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CAN NOT BE CONVENED
8786-276735-0019 WHICH IT WAS PRESENTED TO EXCUSE THE FACT BEING THAT A STATE AND NOT AN UNLAWFUL COMBINATION AS ASSERTED WAS THE OBJECT OF ASSAULT
8786-276735-0020 FOR THIS EVASION OF THE CONSTITUTION OF HIS COUNTRY PRESIDENT LINCOLN IN HIS MESSAGE TO CONGRESS OF JULY FOURTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE RESORTED TO THE ARTIFICE OF SAYING IT MEANING THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES
8786-276735-0021 PRESENTS TO THE WHOLE FAMILY OF MAN THE QUESTION WHETHER A CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC OR DEMOCRACY A GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE BY THE SAME PEOPLE CAN OR CAN NOT MAINTAIN ITS TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AGAINST ITS OWN DOMESTIC FOES
8786-276735-0022 THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS VERY PLAIN IN THE NATURE OF THINGS NO UNION CAN BE FORMED EXCEPT BY SEPARATE INDEPENDENT AND DISTINCT PARTIES ANY OTHER COMBINATION IS NOT A UNION AND UPON THE DESTRUCTION OF ANY OF THESE ELEMENTS IN THE PARTIES
8786-276735-0023 IT IS A WRONG WHICH NO LAPSE OF TIME OR COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES CAN EVER MAKE RIGHT A FORCED UNION IS A POLITICAL ABSURDITY NO LESS ABSURD IS PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S EFFORT TO DISSEVER THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE FROM THAT OF THE STATE
8786-276735-0024 AS IF THERE COULD BE A STATE WITHOUT A PEOPLE OR A SOVEREIGN PEOPLE WITHOUT A STATE BUT THE QUESTION WHICH MISTER LINCOLN PRESENTS TO THE WHOLE FAMILY OF MAN DESERVES A FURTHER NOTICE
8786-276735-0025 THE ANSWER WHICH HE SEEMS TO INFER WOULD BE GIVEN BY THE WHOLE FAMILY OF MAN IS THAT SUCH A GOVERNMENT AS HE SUPPOSES CAN MAINTAIN ITS TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AGAINST ITS OWN DOMESTIC FOES AND THEREFORE HE CONCLUDED THAT HE WAS RIGHT IN THE JUDGMENT OF
8786-276735-0026 PLANTING HIMSELF ON THIS POSITION HE COMMENCED THE DEVASTATION AND BLOODSHED WHICH FOLLOWED TO EFFECT OUR SUBJUGATION NOTHING COULD BE MORE ERRONEOUS THAN SUCH VIEWS THE SUPPOSED CASE WHICH HE PRESENTS IS ENTIRELY UNLIKE THE REAL CASE
8786-276735-0027 THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS LIKE NO OTHER GOVERNMENT IT IS NEITHER A CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC OR DEMOCRACY NOR HAS IT EVER BEEN THUS CALLED
8786-276735-0028 BUT IT IS KNOWN AND DESIGNATED AS THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES IT IS AN ANOMALY AMONG GOVERNMENTS ITS AUTHORITY CONSISTS SOLELY OF CERTAIN POWERS DELEGATED TO IT AS A COMMON AGENT BY AN ASSOCIATION OF SOVEREIGN AND INDEPENDENT STATES
8786-276735-0029 THESE POWERS ARE TO BE EXERCISED ONLY FOR CERTAIN SPECIFIED OBJECTS AND THE PURPOSES DECLARED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE DEED OR INSTRUMENT OF DELEGATION WERE TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION ESTABLISH JUSTICE INSURE DOMESTIC TRANQUILLITY
8786-276735-0030 PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE PROMOTE THE GENERAL WELFARE AND SECURE THE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY TO OURSELVES AND OUR POSTERITY THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF ALL THE POWERS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES ARE TO BE FOUND IN THAT INSTRUMENT OF DELEGATION
8786-276735-0031 ALL ITS POWERS ARE THERE EXPRESSED DEFINED AND LIMITED IT WAS ONLY TO THAT INSTRUMENT MISTER LINCOLN AS PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE GONE TO LEARN HIS DUTIES THAT WAS THE CHART WHICH HE HAD JUST SOLEMNLY PLEDGED HIMSELF TO THE COUNTRY FAITHFULLY TO FOLLOW
8786-276735-0032 HE SOON DEVIATED WIDELY FROM IT AND FATALLY ERRONEOUS WAS HIS COURSE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE AFFAIRS OF A GREAT PEOPLE AT A MOST PERILOUS PERIOD IS DECIDED BY THE ANSWER WHICH IT IS ASSUMED THE WHOLE FAMILY OF MAN WOULD GIVE
8786-276735-0033 TO A SUPPOSED CONDITION OF HUMAN AFFAIRS WHICH DID NOT EXIST AND WHICH COULD NOT EXIST THIS IS THE GROUND UPON WHICH THE RECTITUDE OF HIS CAUSE WAS PLACED HE SAYS NO CHOICE WAS LEFT BUT TO CALL OUT THE WAR POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT
8786-276735-0034 AND SO TO RESIST FORCE EMPLOYED FOR ITS DESTRUCTION BY FORCE FOR ITS PRESERVATION HERE HE SAYS NO CHOICE WAS LEFT BUT TO CALL OUT THE WAR POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR WHAT PURPOSE MUST HE CALL OUT THIS WAR POWER HE ANSWERS BY SAYING
8786-276735-0035 AND SO TO RESIST FORCE EMPLOYED FOR ITS DESTRUCTION BY FORCE FOR ITS PRESERVATION BUT THIS WHICH HE ASSERTS IS NOT A FACT THERE WAS NO FORCE EMPLOYED FOR ITS DESTRUCTION
8786-276735-0036 AND PERUSE THE FRUITLESS EFFORTS FOR PEACE WHICH WERE MADE BY US AND WHICH MISTER LINCOLN DID NOT DEIGN TO NOTICE THE ASSERTION IS NOT ONLY INCORRECT IN STATING THAT FORCE WAS EMPLOYED BY US BUT ALSO IN DECLARING THAT IT WAS FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES
8786-276735-0037 HE NOW GOES TO THE CONSTITUTION FOR THE EXERCISE OF HIS WAR POWER AND HERE WE HAVE ANOTHER FICTION ON APRIL NINETEENTH FOUR DAYS LATER PRESIDENT LINCOLN ISSUED ANOTHER PROCLAMATION ANNOUNCING A BLOCKADE OF THE PORTS OF SEVEN CONFEDERATED STATES
8786-276735-0038 WHICH WAS AFTERWARD EXTENDED TO NORTH CAROLINA AND VIRGINIA IT FURTHER DECLARED THAT ALL PERSONS WHO SHOULD UNDER THEIR AUTHORITY MOLEST ANY VESSEL OF THE UNITED STATES OR THE PERSONS OR CARGO ON BOARD SHOULD BE TREATED AS PIRATES IN THEIR EFFORTS TO SUBJUGATE US
8786-276735-0039 THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR COMMERCE WAS REGARDED BY THE AUTHORITIES AT WASHINGTON AS A MOST EFFICIENT MEASURE IT WAS EARLY SEEN THAT ALTHOUGH ACTS OF CONGRESS ESTABLISHED PORTS OF ENTRY WHERE COMMERCE EXISTED THEY MIGHT BE REPEALED
8786-276735-0040 IN HIS DISCRETION TO CLOSE OUR PORTS
8786-276735-0041 WAS AN INSURRECTION WAS IT AN INSURRECTION WHEN CERTAIN SOVEREIGN AND INDEPENDENT STATES FORM A UNION WITH LIMITED POWERS FOR SOME GENERAL PURPOSES AND ANY ONE OR MORE OF THEM IN THE PROGRESS OF TIME
8786-276735-0042 SUFFER UNJUST AND OPPRESSIVE GRIEVANCES FOR WHICH THERE IS NO REDRESS BUT IN A WITHDRAWAL FROM THE ASSOCIATION IS SUCH WITHDRAWAL AN INSURRECTION IF SO THEN OF WHAT ADVANTAGE IS A COMPACT OF UNION TO STATES
8786-276735-0043 WITHIN THE UNION ARE OPPRESSIONS AND GRIEVANCES AND THE ATTEMPT TO GO OUT BRINGS WAR AND SUBJUGATION THE AMBITIOUS AND AGGRESSIVE STATES OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THE CENTRAL AUTHORITY WHICH HAVING GROWN STRONG IN THE LAPSE OF TIME ASSERTS ITS ENTIRE SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE STATES
8786-276735-0044 WHERE WILL IT END WHERE IS THE VALUE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTY WHAT STRENGTH IS THERE IN BILLS OF RIGHTS IN LIMITATIONS OF POWER WHAT NEW HOPE FOR MANKIND IS TO BE FOUND IN WRITTEN CONSTITUTIONS WHAT REMEDY WHICH DID NOT EXIST UNDER KINGS OR EMPERORS
8786-276735-0045 THEN LOOK THROUGH EITHER END OF THE POLITICAL TELESCOPE AND ONE SEES ONLY AN EMPIRE
8786-276735-0046 AND THE COMPACT OF UNION DENOUNCED AS A FLAUNTING LIE THOSE WHO SUBMIT TO SUCH CONSEQUENCES WITHOUT RESISTANCE ARE NOT WORTHY OF THE LIBERTIES AND THE RIGHTS TO WHICH THEY WERE BORN AND DESERVE TO BE MADE SLAVES SUCH MUST BE THE VERDICT OF MANKIND
8786-276735-0047 MEN DO NOT FIGHT TO MAKE A FRATERNAL UNION NEITHER DO NATIONS THESE MILITARY PREPARATIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES SIGNIFIED NOTHING LESS THAN THE SUBJUGATION OF THE SOUTHERN STATES SO THAT BY ONE DEVASTATING BLOW
8786-276735-0048 APPARENTLY CONTRADICTORY AS ARE THE TERMS OF THIS SINGULAR DOCUMENT ONE POINT IS UNMISTAKABLY EVIDENT
8786-276735-0049 WHOSE FIRST SERVICE IS TO BE THE CAPTURE OF OUR FORTS IT IS A PLAIN DECLARATION OF WAR WHICH I AM NOT AT LIBERTY TO DISREGARD
8786-276735-0050 THE PRESIDENT IS USURPING A POWER GRANTED EXCLUSIVELY TO CONGRESS
8786-276735-0051 AND WERE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN LEVYING TROOPS FOR THE PURPOSE INDICATED IN THE PROCLAMATION MEANTIME BEING DEPRIVED OF THE AID OF CONGRESS I HAD BEEN UNDER THE NECESSITY OF CONFINING MY ACTION TO A CALL ON THE STATES FOR VOLUNTEERS FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE
8786-276735-0052 IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORITY PREVIOUSLY CONFERRED ON ME I STATED THAT THERE WERE THEN IN THE FIELD AT CHARLESTON PENSACOLA FORTS MORGAN JACKSON SAINT PHILIP AND PULASKI NINETEEN THOUSAND MEN AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND MORE WERE ON THEIR WAY TO VIRGINIA
8786-276735-0053 THAT IT WAS PROPOSED TO ORGANIZE AND HOLD IN READINESS FOR INSTANT ACTION IN VIEW OF THE EXISTING EXIGENCIES OF THE COUNTRY AN ARMY OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN AND THAT IF A FURTHER FORCE SHOULD BE NEEDED CONGRESS WOULD BE APPEALED TO FOR AUTHORITY TO CALL IT INTO THE FIELD FINALLY
8786-276735-0054 TO INVADE OUR SOIL CAPTURE OUR FORTS BLOCKADE OUR PORTS AND WAGE WAR AGAINST US RENDERED IT NECESSARY TO RAISE MEANS TO A MUCH LARGER AMOUNT THAN HAD BEEN DONE TO DEFRAY THE EXPENSES OF MAINTAINING INDEPENDENCE AND REPELLING INVASION
8786-276735-0055 A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT FOLLOWED AND NOTWITHSTANDING FREQUENT DECLARATIONS OF THE PEACEFUL INTENTIONS OF THE WITHDRAWING STATES HAD BEEN MADE IN THE MOST SOLEMN MANNER IT WAS DEEMED NOT TO BE OUT OF PLACE TO REPEAT THEM ONCE MORE AND THEREFORE THE MESSAGE CLOSED WITH THESE WORDS
8786-276735-0056 WE PROTEST SOLEMNLY IN THE FACE OF MANKIND THAT WE DESIRE PEACE AT ANY SACRIFICE SAVE THAT OF HONOR IN INDEPENDENCE WE SEEK NO CONQUEST NO AGGRANDIZEMENT NO CONCESSION OF ANY KIND FROM THE STATES WITH WHICH WE HAVE LATELY BEEN CONFEDERATED
8786-276735-0057 ALL WE ASK IS TO BE LET ALONE THAT THOSE WHO NEVER HELD POWER OVER US SHALL NOT NOW ATTEMPT OUR SUBJUGATION BY ARMS THIS WE WILL WE MUST RESIST TO THE DIREST EXTREMITY THE MOMENT THAT THIS PRETENSION IS ABANDONED
8786-276735-0058 THE SWORD WILL DROP FROM OUR GRASP AND WE SHALL BE READY TO ENTER INTO TREATIES OF AMITY AND COMMERCE THAT CAN NOT BUT BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL SO LONG AS THIS PRETENSION IS MAINTAINED WITH A FIRM RELIANCE ON THAT DIVINE POWER WHICH COVERS WITH ITS PROTECTION THE JUST CAUSE
8786-276735-0059 WE MUST CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE FOR OUR INHERENT RIGHT TO FREEDOM INDEPENDENCE AND SELF GOVERNMENT AT THIS SESSION CONGRESS PASSED ACTS AUTHORIZING THE PRESIDENT TO USE THE WHOLE LAND AND NAVAL FORCE TO MEET THE NECESSITIES OF THE WAR THUS COMMENCED
8786-276735-0060 TO ISSUE TO PRIVATE ARMED VESSELS LETTERS OF MARQUE IN ADDITION TO THE VOLUNTEER FORCE AUTHORIZED TO BE RAISED TO ACCEPT THE SERVICES OF VOLUNTEERS TO SERVE DURING THE WAR TO RECEIVE INTO THE SERVICE VARIOUS COMPANIES OF THE DIFFERENT ARMS

8786-276735-0062 AND SUCH OTHERS AS WERE NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE INTERNAL ORGANIZATION OF THE GOVERNMENT AND ESTABLISH THE ADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS IN EVERY PORTION OF THE COUNTRY THERE WAS EXHIBITED THE MOST PATRIOTIC DEVOTION TO THE COMMON CAUSE
8786-276735-0063 TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES FREELY TENDERED THE USE OF THEIR LINES FOR TROOPS AND SUPPLIES REQUISITIONS FOR TROOPS WERE MET WITH SUCH ALACRITY THAT THE NUMBER OFFERING THEIR SERVICES IN EVERY INSTANCE GREATLY EXCEEDED THE DEMAND
8786-276735-0064 THE GRAVITY OF AGE AND THE ZEAL OF YOUTH RIVALED EACH OTHER IN THE DESIRE TO BE FOREMOST IN THE PUBLIC DEFENSE THE APPEARANCE OF THE PROCLAMATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES CALLING OUT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEN WAS FOLLOWED BY THE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF THE STATES OF VIRGINIA
8786-276735-0065 NORTH CAROLINA TENNESSEE AND ARKANSAS AND THEIR UNION WITH THE CONFEDERATE STATES THE FORMER STATE THUS PLACED ON THE FRONTIER AND EXPOSED TO INVASION BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR A RESOLUTE DEFENSE
8786-276735-0066 VOLUNTEERS WERE ORDERED TO BE ENROLLED AND HELD IN READINESS IN EVERY PART OF THE STATE COLONEL ROBERT E LEE HAVING RESIGNED HIS COMMISSION IN THE UNITED STATES CAVALRY
8786-276735-0067 COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE MILITARY AND NAVAL FORCES OF THE COMMONWEALTH ALREADY THE NORTHERN OFFICER IN CHARGE HAD EVACUATED HARPER'S FERRY AFTER HAVING ATTEMPTED TO DESTROY THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS THERE HIS REPORT SAYS I GAVE THE ORDER TO APPLY THE TORCH
8786-276735-0068 IN THREE MINUTES OR LESS BOTH OF THE ARSENAL BUILDINGS CONTAINING NEARLY FIFTEEN THOUSAND STAND OF ARMS TOGETHER WITH THE CARPENTER'S SHOP WHICH WAS AT THE UPPER END OF A LONG AND CONNECTED SERIES OF WORKSHOPS OF THE ARMORY PROPER WERE IN A BLAZE THERE IS EVERY REASON FOR BELIEVING THE DESTRUCTION WAS COMPLETE
8786-276735-0069 I AM DIRECTED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO COMMUNICATE TO YOU AND THROUGH YOU TO THE OFFICERS AND MEN UNDER YOUR COMMAND AT HARPER'S FERRY ARMORY THE APPROBATION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF YOUR AND THEIR JUDICIOUS CONDUCT THERE
8786-276735-0070 AND TO TENDER YOU AND THEM THE THANKS OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE SAME AT THE SAME TIME THE SHIP YARD AT NORFOLK WAS ABANDONED AFTER AN ATTEMPT TO DESTROY IT ABOUT MIDNIGHT OF APRIL TWENTIETH A FIRE WAS STARTED IN THE YARD
8786-276735-0071 WHICH CONTINUED TO INCREASE AND BEFORE DAYLIGHT THE WORK OF DESTRUCTION EXTENDED TO TWO IMMENSE SHIP HOUSES ONE OF WHICH CONTAINED THE ENTIRE FRAME OF A SEVENTY FOUR GUN SHIP AND TO THE LONG RANGES OF STORES AND OFFICES ON EACH SIDE OF THE ENTRANCE THE GREAT SHIP PENNSYLVANIA WAS BURNED

8786-276735-0073 AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ASSERTED WHERE CAN HE FIND A JUSTIFICATION OF THESE ACTS IN EXPLANATION OF HIS POLICY TO THE COMMISSIONERS SENT TO HIM BY THE VIRGINIA STATE CONVENTION HE SAID REFERRING TO HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS
8786-276735-0074 AS HE REGARDED IT TO THE GOVERNMENT HOW UNREASONABLE HOW BLIND WITH RAGE MUST HAVE BEEN THAT ADMINISTRATION OF AFFAIRS WHICH SO QUICKLY BROUGHT THE GOVERNMENT TO THE NECESSITY OF DESTROYING ITS OWN MEANS OF DEFENSE IN ORDER AS IT PUBLICLY DECLARED
8786-276735-0075 TO MAINTAIN ITS LIFE IT WOULD SEEM AS IF THE PASSIONS THAT RULE THE SAVAGE HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE AUTHORITIES AT THE UNITED STATES CAPITAL IN THE CONFLAGRATIONS OF VAST STRUCTURES THE WANTON DESTRUCTION OF PUBLIC PROPERTY
8786-276735-0076 AND STILL MORE IN THE ISSUE OF LETTRES DE CACHET BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE WHO BOASTED OF THE POWER OF HIS LITTLE BELL OVER THE PERSONAL LIBERTIES OF THE CITIZEN THE PEOPLE SAW OR MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE RAPID STRIDES TOWARD DESPOTISM MADE UNDER THE MASK OF PRESERVING THE UNION
