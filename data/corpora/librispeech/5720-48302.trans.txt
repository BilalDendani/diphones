5720-48302-0000 BUT SHE WAS DUTIFUL AND SHE WAS REALLY FOND OF AUNT HANNAH SO SHE ACCEPTED AS GRACEFULLY AS POSSIBLE THAT GOOD LADY'S DICTUM THAT A WOMAN WHO COULD NOT SEW AND SEW WELL
5720-48302-0001 WAS TO PLAY ON CYRIL'S PIANO SHE WAS VERY CAREFUL HOWEVER THAT MISTER CYRIL HIMSELF DID NOT FIND THIS OUT CYRIL WAS FREQUENTLY GONE FROM THE HOUSE AND ALMOST AS FREQUENTLY
5720-48302-0002 AUNT HANNAH TOOK NAPS AT SUCH TIMES IT WAS VERY EASY TO SLIP UP STAIRS TO CYRIL'S ROOMS AND ONCE AT THE PIANO BILLY FORGOT EVERYTHING ELSE
5720-48302-0003 ONE DAY HOWEVER THE INEVITABLE HAPPENED CYRIL CAME HOME UNEXPECTEDLY THE MAN HEARD THE PIANO FROM WILLIAM'S FLOOR AND WITH A SURPRISED EJACULATION
5720-48302-0004 HE HURRIED UPSTAIRS TWO STEPS AT A TIME AT THE DOOR HE STOPPED IN AMAZEMENT BILLY WAS AT THE PIANO BUT SHE WAS NOT PLAYING RAG TIME THE STORM
5720-48302-0005 THERE WAS NO MUSIC BEFORE HER BUT UNDER HER FINGERS BIG BASS NOTES VERY MUCH LIKE CYRIL'S OWN WERE MARCHING ON AND ON TO VICTORY
5720-48302-0006 BILLY'S FACE WAS RAPTUROUSLY INTENT AND HAPPY BY JOVE BILLY GASPED THE MAN BILLY LEAPED TO HER FEET AND WHIRLED AROUND GUILTILY OH
5720-48302-0007 MISTER CYRIL I'M SO SORRY SORRY AND YOU PLAY LIKE THAT NO NO I'M NOT SORRY I PLAYED IT'S BECAUSE YOU FOUND ME
5720-48302-0008 BILLY'S CHEEKS WERE A SHAMED RED BUT HER EYES WERE DEFIANTLY BRILLIANT AND HER CHIN WAS AT A REBELLIOUS TILT
5720-48302-0009 NOT IF YOU WEREN'T HERE WITH YOUR NERVES THE MAN LAUGHED AND CAME SLOWLY INTO THE ROOM BILLY WHO TAUGHT YOU TO PLAY NO ONE I CAN'T PLAY
5720-48302-0010 BUT YOU DO PLAY I JUST HEARD YOU
5720-48302-0011 DIDN'T YOU EVER STUDY MUSIC BILLY'S EYES DIMMED NO THAT WAS THE ONLY THING AUNT ELLA AND I DIDN'T THINK ALIKE ABOUT SHE HAD AN OLD SQUARE PIANO
5720-48302-0012 ALL TIN PANNY AND THIN YOU KNOW I PLAYED SOME ON IT AND WANTED TO TAKE LESSONS BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO PRACTISE ON THAT I WANTED A NEW ONE THAT'S WHAT SHE WOULDN'T DO
5720-48302-0013 GET ME A NEW PIANO OR LET ME DO IT SHE SAID SHE PRACTISED ON THAT PIANO AND THAT IT WAS QUITE GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME ESPECIALLY TO LEARN ON
5720-48302-0014 I HATED THAT PIANO SO
5720-48302-0015 WHEN WHEN AUNT ELLA DIED AND ALL YOU PLAY THEN IS JUST BY EAR BY EAR
5720-48302-0016 IF YOU MEAN WHAT I HEAR EASY THINGS I CAN PLAY QUICK BUT BUT THOSE CHORDS ARE HARD THEY SKIP AROUND SO CYRIL SMILED ODDLY
5720-48302-0017 DROPPING HERSELF ON TO THE PIANO STOOL AND WHISKING ABOUT BILLY WAS NOT AFRAID NOW NOR DEFIANT SHE WAS ONLY EAGER AND HAPPY AGAIN IN A MOMENT A DREAMY WALTZ FELL UPON CYRIL'S EARS
5720-48302-0018 A WALTZ THAT HE OFTEN PLAYED HIMSELF IT WAS NOT PLAYED CORRECTLY IT IS TRUE THERE WERE NOTES AND SOMETIMES WHOLE MEASURES THAT WERE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE PRINTED MUSIC BUT THE TUNE THE RHYTHM AND THE SPIRIT WERE THERE
5720-48302-0019 AND THERE'S THIS SAID BILLY AND THIS SHE WENT ON SLIDING INTO ONE LITTLE STRAIN AFTER ANOTHER ALL OF WHICH WERE RECOGNIZED BY THE AMAZED MAN AT HER SIDE BILLY HE CRIED WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED
5720-48302-0020 AND WHIRLED UPON HIM AGAIN BILLY WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEARN TO PLAY REALLY PLAY FROM NOTES
5720-48302-0021 WE'LL HAVE A PIANO TOMORROW IN YOUR ROOMS FOR YOU TO PRACTISE ON AND I'LL TEACH YOU MYSELF OH THANK YOU MISTER CYRIL
5720-48302-0022 YOU DON'T KNOW HOW I THANK YOU EXULTED BILLY AS SHE DANCED FROM THE ROOM TO TELL AUNT HANNAH OF THIS GREAT AND GOOD THING THAT HAD COME INTO HER LIFE TO BILLY
5720-48302-0023 THIS PROMISE OF CYRIL'S TO BE HER TEACHER WAS VERY KIND VERY DELIGHTFUL BUT IT WAS NOT IN THE LEAST A THING AT WHICH TO MARVEL TO BERTRAM HOWEVER IT MOST CERTAINLY WAS
5720-48302-0024 WELL GUESS WHAT'S HAPPENED HE SAID TO WILLIAM THAT NIGHT AFTER HE HAD HEARD THE NEWS
5720-48302-0025 THAT YOU'LL RAFFLE OFF YOUR COLLECTION OF TEAPOTS AT THE NEXT CHURCH FAIR OR THAT I SHALL GO TO EGYPT AS A COOKY GUIDE
