3257-169288-0000 CHAPTER NINE ANXIOUS DAYS AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS THE COMING OF CHRISTMAS THAT FIRST YEAR OF OUR RESIDENCE IN ALABAMA GAVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET A FARTHER INSIGHT INTO THE REAL LIFE OF THE PEOPLE
3257-169288-0001 ASKING FOR CHRIS'MUS GIFTS CHRIS'MUS GIFTS BETWEEN THE HOURS OF TWO O'CLOCK AND FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I PRESUME THAT WE MUST HAVE HAD A HALF HUNDRED SUCH CALLS
3257-169288-0002 THIS CUSTOM PREVAILS THROUGHOUT THIS PORTION OF THE SOUTH TO DAY DURING THE DAYS OF SLAVERY IT WAS A CUSTOM QUITE GENERALLY OBSERVED THROUGHOUT ALL THE SOUTHERN STATES TO GIVE THE COLOURED PEOPLE A WEEK OF HOLIDAY AT CHRISTMAS
3257-169288-0003 OR TO ALLOW THE HOLIDAY TO CONTINUE AS LONG AS THE YULE LOG LASTED THE MALE MEMBERS OF THE RACE AND OFTEN THE FEMALE MEMBERS WERE EXPECTED TO GET DRUNK
3257-169288-0004 WE FOUND THAT FOR A WHOLE WEEK THE COLOURED PEOPLE IN AND AROUND TUSKEGEE DROPPED WORK THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ANY ONE TO PERFORM ANY SERVICE FROM THE TIME THEY STOPPED WORK UNTIL AFTER THE NEW YEAR
3257-169288-0005 PERSONS WHO AT OTHER TIMES DID NOT USE STRONG DRINK THOUGHT IT QUITE THE PROPER THING TO INDULGE IN IT RATHER FREELY DURING THE CHRISTMAS WEEK THERE WAS A WIDESPREAD HILARITY
3257-169288-0006 I WENT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE TOWN TO VISIT THE PEOPLE ON ONE OF THE LARGE PLANTATIONS IN THEIR POVERTY AND IGNORANCE IT WAS PATHETIC TO SEE THEIR ATTEMPTS TO GET JOY OUT OF THE SEASON THAT IN MOST PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IS SO SACRED AND SO DEAR TO THE HEART
3257-169288-0007 IN ONE CABIN I NOTICE THAT ALL THAT THE FIVE CHILDREN HAD TO REMIND THEM OF THE COMING OF CHRIST WAS A SINGLE BUNCH OF FIRECRACKERS WHICH THEY HAD DIVIDED AMONG THEM IN ANOTHER CABIN WHERE THERE WERE AT LEAST A HALF DOZEN PERSONS
3257-169288-0008 IN ANOTHER FAMILY THEY HAD ONLY A FEW PIECES OF SUGARCANE IN STILL ANOTHER CABIN I FOUND NOTHING BUT A NEW JUG OF CHEAP MEAN WHISKEY WHICH THE HUSBAND AND WIFE WERE MAKING FREE USE OF
3257-169288-0009 NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT THE HUSBAND WAS ONE OF THE LOCAL MINISTERS IN A FEW INSTANCES I FOUND THAT THE PEOPLE HAD GOTTEN HOLD OF SOME BRIGHT COLOURED CARDS THAT HAD BEEN DESIGNED FOR ADVERTISING PURPOSES AND WERE MAKING THE MOST OF THESE
3257-169288-0010 IN OTHER HOMES SOME MEMBER OF THE FAMILY HAD BOUGHT A NEW PISTOL IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN IN THE CABIN TO REMIND ONE OF THE COMING OF THE SAVIOUR
3257-169288-0011 EXCEPT THAT THE PEOPLE HAD CEASED WORK IN THE FIELDS AND WERE LOUNGING ABOUT THEIR HOMES AT NIGHT DURING CHRISTMAS WEEK THEY USUALLY HAD WHAT THEY CALLED A FROLIC IN SOME CABIN ON THE PLANTATION THAT MEANT A KIND OF ROUGH DANCE
3257-169288-0012 WHERE THERE WAS LIKELY TO BE A GOOD DEAL OF WHISKEY USED AND WHERE THERE MIGHT BE SOME SHOOTING OR CUTTING WITH RAZORS WHILE I WAS MAKING THIS CHRISTMAS VISIT I MET AN OLD COLOURED MAN WHO WAS ONE OF THE NUMEROUS LOCAL PREACHERS
3257-169288-0013 WHO TRIED TO CONVINCE ME FROM THE EXPERIENCE ADAM HAD IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN THAT GOD HAD CURSED ALL LABOUR AND THAT THEREFORE IT WAS A SIN FOR ANY MAN TO WORK FOR THAT REASON THIS MAN SOUGHT TO DO AS LITTLE WORK AS POSSIBLE
3257-169288-0014 HE SEEMED AT THAT TIME TO BE SUPREMELY HAPPY BECAUSE HE WAS LIVING AS HE EXPRESSED IT THROUGH ONE WEEK THAT WAS FREE FROM SIN IN THE SCHOOL WE MADE A SPECIAL EFFORT TO TEACH OUR STUDENTS THE MEANING OF CHRISTMAS
3257-169288-0015 AND TO GIVE THEM LESSONS IN ITS PROPER OBSERVANCE IN THIS WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL TO A DEGREE THAT MAKES ME FEEL SAFE IN SAYING THAT THE SEASON NOW HAS A NEW MEANING NOT ONLY THROUGH ALL THAT IMMEDIATE REGION BUT IN A MEASURE
3257-169288-0016 IS THE UNSELFISH AND BEAUTIFUL WAY IN WHICH OUR GRADUATES AND STUDENTS SPEND THEIR TIME IN ADMINISTERING TO THE COMFORT AND HAPPINESS OF OTHERS ESPECIALLY THE UNFORTUNATE
3257-169288-0017 NOT LONG AGO SOME OF OUR YOUNG MEN SPENT A HOLIDAY IN REBUILDING A CABIN FOR A HELPLESS COLOURED WOMEN WHO WAS ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE YEARS OLD AT ANOTHER TIME I REMEMBER THAT I MADE IT KNOWN IN CHAPEL ONE NIGHT
3257-169288-0018 I HAVE REFERRED TO THE DISPOSITION ON THE PART OF THE WHITE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN OF TUSKEGEE AND VICINITY TO HELP THE SCHOOL FROM THE FIRST I RESOLVED TO MAKE THE SCHOOL A REAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH IT WAS LOCATED
3257-169288-0019 I WAS DETERMINED THAT NO ONE SHOULD HAVE THE FEELING THAT IT WAS A FOREIGN INSTITUTION DROPPED DOWN IN THE MIDST OF THE PEOPLE FOR WHICH THEY HAD NO RESPONSIBILITY AND IN WHICH THEY HAD NO INTEREST
3257-169288-0020 I NOTICED THAT THE VERY FACT THAT THEY HAD BEEN ASKING TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THE PURCHASE OF THE LAND MADE THEM BEGIN TO FEEL AS IF IT WAS GOING TO BE THEIR SCHOOL TO A LARGE DEGREE
3257-169288-0021 I NOTED THAT JUST IN PROPORTION AS WE MADE THE WHITE PEOPLE FEEL THAT THE INSTITUTION WAS A PART OF THE LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY AND THAT WHILE WE WANTED TO MAKE FRIENDS IN BOSTON FOR EXAMPLE WE ALSO WANTED TO MAKE WHITE FRIENDS IN TUSKEGEE
3257-169288-0022 AND THAT WE WANTED TO MAKE THE SCHOOL OF REAL SERVICE TO ALL THE PEOPLE THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD THE SCHOOL BECAME FAVOURABLE PERHAPS I MIGHT ADD RIGHT HERE WHAT I HOPE TO DEMONSTRATE LATER THAT SO FAR AS I KNOW
3257-169288-0023 THE TUSKEGEE SCHOOL AT THE PRESENT TIME HAS NO WARMER AND MORE ENTHUSIASTIC FRIENDS ANYWHERE THAN IT HAS AMONG THE WHITE CITIZENS OF TUSKEGEE AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF ALABAMA AND THE ENTIRE SOUTH FROM THE FIRST
3257-169288-0024 I HAVE ADVISED OUR PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH TO MAKE FRIENDS IN EVERY STRAIGHTFORWARD MANLY WAY WITH THEIR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOUR WHETHER HE BE A BLACK MAN OR A WHITE MAN I HAVE ALSO ADVISED THEM WHERE NO PRINCIPLE IS AT STAKE
3257-169288-0025 TO CONSULT THE INTERESTS OF THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND TO ADVISE WITH THEIR FRIENDS IN REGARD TO THEIR VOTING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS THE WORK OF SECURING THE MONEY WITH WHICH TO PAY FOR THE FARM WENT ON WITHOUT CEASING
3257-169288-0026 AT THE END OF THREE MONTHS ENOUGH WAS SECURED TO REPAY THE LOAN OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS TO GENERAL MARSHALL AND WITHIN TWO MONTHS MORE WE HAD SECURED THE ENTIRE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND HAD RECEIVED A DEED OF THE ONE HUNDRED ACRES OF LAND
3257-169288-0027 THIS GAVE US A GREAT DEAL OF SATISFACTION IT WAS NOT ONLY A SOURCE OF SATISFACTION TO SECURE A PERMANENT LOCATION FOR THE SCHOOL BUT IT WAS EQUALLY SATISFACTORY TO KNOW THAT THE GREATER PART OF THE MONEY WITH WHICH IT WAS PAID FOR
3257-169288-0028 HAD BEEN GOTTEN FROM THE WHITE AND COLOURED PEOPLE IN THE TOWN OF TUSKEGEE THE MOST OF THIS MONEY WAS OBTAINED BY HOLDING FESTIVALS AND CONCERTS AND FROM SMALL INDIVIDUAL DONATIONS
3257-169288-0029 OUR NEXT EFFORT WAS IN THE DIRECTION OF INCREASING THE CULTIVATION OF THE LAND
3257-169288-0030 ALL THE INDUSTRIES AT TUSKEGEE HAVE BEEN STARTED IN NATURAL AND LOGICAL ORDER GROWING OUT OF THE NEEDS OF A COMMUNITY SETTLEMENT WE BEGAN WITH FARMING BECAUSE WE WANTED SOMETHING TO EAT
3257-169288-0031 MANY OF THE STUDENTS ALSO WERE ABLE TO REMAIN IN SCHOOL BUT A FEW WEEKS AT A TIME BECAUSE THEY HAD SO LITTLE MONEY WITH WHICH TO PAY THEIR BOARD THUS ANOTHER OBJECT WHICH MADE IT DESIRABLE TO GET AN INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM STARTED
3257-169288-0032 WAS IN ORDER TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE AS A MEANS OF HELPING THE STUDENTS TO EARN MONEY ENOUGH SO THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN SCHOOL DURING THE NINE MONTHS SESSION OF THE SCHOOL YEAR THE FIRST ANIMAL THAT THE SCHOOL CAME INTO POSSESSION OF
3257-169288-0033 WAS AN OLD BLIND HORSE GIVEN US BY ONE OF THE WHITE CITIZENS OF TUSKEGEE PERHAPS I MAY ADD HERE THAT AT THE PRESENT TIME THE SCHOOL OWNS OVER TWO HUNDRED HORSES COLTS MULES COWS CALVES AND OXEN
3257-169288-0034 THE CULTIVATION OF THE LAND BEGUN AND THE OLD CABINS WHICH WE HAD FOUND ON THE PLACE SOMEWHAT REPAIRED WE TURNED OUR ATTENTION TOWARD PROVIDING A LARGE SUBSTANTIAL BUILDING AFTER HAVING GIVEN A GOOD DEAL OF THOUGHT TO THE SUBJECT
3257-169288-0035 WE FINALLY HAD THE PLANS DRAWN FOR A BUILDING THAT WAS ESTIMATED TO COST ABOUT SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS SEEMED TO US A TREMENDOUS SUM BUT WE KNEW THAT THE SCHOOL MUST GO BACKWARD OR FORWARD
3257-169288-0036 AND THAT OUR WORK WOULD MEAN LITTLE UNLESS WE COULD GET HOLD OF THE STUDENTS IN THEIR HOME LIFE ONE INCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED ABOUT THIS TIME GAVE ME A GREAT DEAL OF SATISFACTION AS WELL AS SURPRISE
3257-169288-0037 WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN IN THE TOWN THAT WE WERE DISCUSSING THE PLANS FOR A NEW LARGE BUILDING A SOUTHERN WHITE MAN WHO WAS OPERATING A SAWMILL NOT FAR FROM TUSKEGEE
3257-169288-0038 CAME TO ME AND SAID THAT HE WOULD GLADLY PUT ALL THE LUMBER NECESSARY TO ERECT THE BUILDING ON THE GROUNDS WITH NO OTHER GUARANTEE FOR PAYMENT THAN MY WORD THAT IT WOULD BE PAID FOR WHEN WE SECURED SOME MONEY
3257-169288-0039 I THINK I NEVER SAW A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE SO HAPPY OVER ANYTHING AS WERE THE COLOURED PEOPLE OVER THE PROSPECT OF THIS NEW BUILDING ONE DAY WHEN WE WERE HOLDING A MEETING TO SECURE FUNDS FOR ITS ERECTION
3257-169288-0040 AN OLD ANTE BELLUM COLOURED MAN CAME A DISTANCE OF TWELVE MILES AND BROUGHT IN HIS OX CART A LARGE HOG WHEN THE MEETING WAS IN PROGRESS HE ROSE IN THE MIDST OF THE COMPANY AND SAID THAT HE HAD NO MONEY WHICH HE COULD GIVE
3257-169288-0041 BUT HE HAD RAISED TWO FINE HOGS AND THAT HE HAD BROUGHT ONE OF THEM AS A CONTRIBUTION TOWARD THE EXPENSES OF THE BUILDING HE CLOSED HIS ANNOUNCEMENT BY SAYING ANY NIGGER THAT'S GOT ANY LOVE FOR HIS RACE OR ANY RESPECT FOR HIMSELF
3257-169288-0042 WILL BRING A HOG TO THE NEXT MEETING QUITE A NUMBER OF MEN IN THE COMMUNITY ALSO VOLUNTEERED TO GIVE SEVERAL DAYS WORK EACH TOWARD THE ERECTION OF THE BUILDING AFTER WE HAD SECURED ALL THE HELP THAT WE COULD IN TUSKEGEE
3257-169288-0043 MISS DAVIDSON DECIDED TO GO NORTH FOR THE PURPOSE OF SECURING ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR WEEKS SHE VISITED INDIVIDUALS AND SPOKE IN CHURCHES AND BEFORE SUNDAY SCHOOLS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS
3257-169288-0044 THEY FELL INTO A CONVERSATION AND THE NORTHERN LADY BECAME SO MUCH INTERESTED IN THE EFFORT BEING MADE AT TUSKEGEE THAT BEFORE THEY PARTED MISS DAVIDSON WAS HANDED A CHECK FOR FIFTY DOLLARS FOR SOME TIME BEFORE OUR MARRIAGE AND ALSO AFTER IT
3257-169288-0045 MISS DAVIDSON KEPT UP THE WORK OF SECURING MONEY IN THE NORTH AND IN THE SOUTH BY INTERESTING PEOPLE BY PERSONAL VISITS AND THROUGH CORRESPONDENCE AT THE SAME TIME SHE KEPT IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH THE WORK AT TUSKEGEE
3257-169288-0046 BUT NEVER SEEMED HAPPY UNLESS SHE WAS GIVING ALL OF HER STRENGTH TO THE CAUSE WHICH SHE LOVED OFTEN AT NIGHT AFTER SPENDING THE DAY IN GOING FROM DOOR TO DOOR TRYING TO INTEREST PERSONS IN THE WORK AT TUSKEGEE
3257-169288-0047 SHE WOULD BE SO EXHAUSTED THAT SHE COULD NOT UNDRESS HERSELF A LADY UPON WHOM SHE CALLED IN BOSTON AFTERWARD TOLD ME THAT AT ONE TIME WHEN MISS DAVIDSON CALLED HER TO SEE AND SEND UP HER CARD
3257-169288-0048 THE LADY WAS DETAINED A LITTLE BEFORE SHE COULD SEE MISS DAVIDSON AND WHEN SHE ENTERED THE PARLOUR SHE FOUND MISS DAVIDSON SO EXHAUSTED THAT SHE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP WHILE PUTTING UP OUR FIRST BUILDING
3257-169288-0049 I HAD GIVEN ONE OF OUR CREDITORS A PROMISE THAT UPON A CERTAIN DAY HE SHOULD BE PAID FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS ON THE MORNING OF THAT DAY WE DID NOT HAVE A DOLLAR THE MAIL ARRIVED AT THE SCHOOL AT TEN O'CLOCK
3257-169288-0050 AND IN THIS MAIL THERE WAS A CHECK SENT BY MISS DAVIDSON FOR EXACTLY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS I COULD RELATE MANY INSTANCES OF ALMOST THE SAME CHARACTER THIS FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS WAS GIVEN BY TWO LADIES IN BOSTON
3257-169288-0051 TWO YEARS LATER WHEN THE WORK AT TUSKEGEE HAD GROWN CONSIDERABLY AND WHEN WE WERE IN THE MIDST OF A SEASON WHEN WE WERE SO MUCH IN NEED OF MONEY THAT THE FUTURE LOOKED DOUBTFUL AND GLOOMY THE SAME TWO BOSTON LADIES SENT US SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS
3257-169288-0052 WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE OUR SURPRISE OR THE ENCOURAGEMENT THAT THE GIFT BROUGHT TO US
3257-169288-0053 AS SOON AS THE PLANS WERE DRAWN FOR THE NEW BUILDING THE STUDENTS BEGAN DIGGING OUT THE EARTH WHERE THE FOUNDATIONS WERE TO BE LAID WORKING AFTER THE REGULAR CLASSES WERE OVER
3257-169288-0054 THEY HAD NOT FULLY OUTGROWN THE IDEA THAT IT WAS HARDLY THE PROPER THING FOR THEM TO USE THEIR HANDS SINCE THEY HAD COME THERE AS ONE OF THEM EXPRESSED IT TO BE EDUCATED AND NOT TO WORK
3257-169288-0055 GRADUALLY THOUGH I NOTED WITH SATISFACTION THAT A SENTIMENT IN FAVOUR OF WORK WAS GAINING GROUND AFTER A FEW WEEKS OF HARD WORK THE FOUNDATIONS WERE READY AND A DAY WAS APPOINTED FOR THE LAYING OF THE CORNER STONE
3257-169288-0056 WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THE LAYING OF THIS CORNER STONE TOOK PLACE IN THE HEART OF THE SOUTH IN THE BLACK BELT IN THE CENTRE OF THAT PART OF OUR COUNTRY THAT WAS MOST DEVOTED TO SLAVERY
3257-169288-0057 THAT AT THAT TIME SLAVERY HAD BEEN ABOLISHED ONLY ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS THAT ONLY SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE NO NEGRO COULD BE TAUGHT FROM BOOKS WITHOUT THE TEACHER RECEIVING THE CONDEMNATION OF THE LAW OR OF PUBLIC SENTIMENT
3257-169288-0058 WHEN ALL THIS IS CONSIDERED THE SCENE THAT WAS WITNESSED ON THAT SPRING DAY AT TUSKEGEE WAS A REMARKABLE ONE I BELIEVE THERE ARE FEW PLACES IN THE WORLD
3257-169288-0059 THE PRINCIPAL ADDRESS WAS DELIVERED BY THE HON WADDY THOMPSON THE SUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION FOR THE COUNTY
3257-169288-0060 ABOUT THE CORNER STONE WERE GATHERED THE TEACHERS THE STUDENTS THEIR PARENTS AND FRIENDS THE COUNTY OFFICIALS WHO WERE WHITE AND ALL THE LEADING WHITE MEN IN THAT VICINITY
3257-169288-0061 TOGETHER WITH MANY OF THE BLACK MEN AND WOMEN WHOM THE SAME WHITE PEOPLE BUT A FEW YEARS BEFORE HAD HELD A TITLE TO AS PROPERTY THE MEMBERS OF BOTH RACES WERE ANXIOUS TO EXERCISE THE PRIVILEGE OF PLACING UNDER THE CORNER STONE SOME MOMENTO
3257-169288-0062 BEFORE THE BUILDING WAS COMPLETED WE PASSED THROUGH SOME VERY TRYING SEASONS MORE THAN ONCE OUR HEARTS WERE MADE TO BLEED AS IT WERE BECAUSE BILLS WERE FALLING DUE THAT WE DID NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO MEET
3257-169288-0063 PERHAPS NO ONE WHO HAS NOT GONE THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE MONTH AFTER MONTH OF TRYING TO ERECT BUILDINGS AND PROVIDE EQUIPMENT FOR A SCHOOL WHEN NO ONE KNEW WHERE THE MONEY WAS TO COME FROM
3257-169288-0064 CAN PROPERLY APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULTIES UNDER WHICH WE LABOURED DURING THE FIRST YEARS AT TUSKEGEE I RECALL THAT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT I WOULD ROLL AND TOSS ON MY BED WITHOUT SLEEP
3257-169288-0065 WE WERE TRYING AN EXPERIMENT THAT OF TESTING WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR NEGROES TO BUILD UP AND CONTROL THE AFFAIRS OF A LARGE EDUCATION INSTITUTION I KNEW THAT IF WE FAILED IT WOULD INJURE THE WHOLE RACE
3257-169288-0066 I KNEW THAT THE PRESUMPTION WAS AGAINST US I KNEW THAT IN THE CASE OF WHITE PEOPLE BEGINNING SUCH AN ENTERPRISE IT WOULD BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SUCCEED BUT IN OUR CASE I FELT THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE SURPRISED IF WE SUCCEEDED
3257-169288-0067 ALL THIS MADE A BURDEN WHICH PRESSED DOWN ON US SOMETIMES IT SEEMED AT THE RATE OF A THOUSAND POUNDS TO THE SQUARE INCH IN ALL OUR DIFFICULTIES AND ANXIETIES HOWEVER
3257-169288-0068 I NEVER WENT TO A WHITE OR A BLACK PERSON IN THE TOWN OF TUSKEGEE FOR ANY ASSISTANCE THAT WAS IN THEIR POWER TO RENDER WITHOUT BEING HELPED ACCORDING TO THEIR MEANS MORE THAN A DOZEN TIMES WHEN BILLS FIGURING UP INTO THE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS WERE FALLING DUE
3257-169288-0069 I APPLIED TO THE WHITE MEN OF TUSKEGEE FOR SMALL LOANS OFTEN BORROWING SMALL AMOUNTS FROM AS MANY AS A HALF DOZEN PERSONS TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS
3257-169288-0070 ONE THING I WAS DETERMINED TO DO FROM THE FIRST AND THAT WAS TO KEEP THE CREDIT OF THE SCHOOL HIGH AND THIS I THINK I CAN SAY WITHOUT BOASTING WE HAVE DONE ALL THROUGH THESE YEARS
3257-169288-0071 I SHALL ALWAYS REMEMBER A BIT OF ADVICE GIVEN ME BY MISTER GEORGE W CAMPBELL THE WHITE MAN TO WHOM I HAVE REFERRED TO AS THE ONE WHO INDUCED GENERAL ARMSTRONG TO SEND ME TO TUSKEGEE SOON AFTER I ENTERED UPON THE WORK
3257-169288-0072 MISTER CAMPBELL SAID TO ME IN HIS FATHERLY WAY WASHINGTON ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT CREDIT IS CAPITAL AT ONE TIME WHEN WE WERE IN THE GREATEST DISTRESS FOR MONEY THAT WE EVER EXPERIENCED
3257-169288-0073 I PLACED THE SITUATION FRANKLY BEFORE GENERAL ARMSTRONG WITHOUT HESITATION HE GAVE ME HIS PERSONAL CHECK FOR ALL THE MONEY WHICH HE HAD SAVED FOR HIS OWN USE
3257-169288-0074 THIS WAS NOT THE ONLY TIME THAT GENERAL ARMSTRONG HELPED TUSKEGEE IN THIS WAY I DO NOT THINK I HAVE EVER MADE THIS FACT PUBLIC BEFORE DURING THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO AT THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR'S WORK OF THE SCHOOL
3257-169288-0075 WE BEGAN KEEPING HOUSE IN TUSKEGEE EARLY IN THE FALL THIS MADE A HOME FOR OUR TEACHERS WHO NOW HAD BEEN INCREASE TO FOUR IN NUMBER MY WIFE WAS ALSO A GRADUATE OF THE HAMPTON INSTITUTE
