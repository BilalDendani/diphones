6145-54685-0000 IT HAD BEEN LEFT FOR ME TO WATCH HER DYING MOMENTS IT WAS LEFT FOR ME TO BESTOW ON HER REMAINS THE LAST HUMAN CHARITY WHICH THE LIVING CAN EXTEND TO THE DEAD IF I COULD HAVE LOOKED INTO THE FUTURE ON OUR FATAL MARRIAGE DAY
6145-54685-0001 AND COULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THE ONLY HOME OF MY GIVING WHICH SHE WOULD EVER INHABIT WOULD BE THE HOME OF THE GRAVE HER FATHER HAD WRITTEN ME A LETTER WHICH I DESTROYED AT THE TIME AND WHICH IF I HAD IT NOW I SHOULD FORBEAR FROM COPYING INTO THESE PAGES
6145-54685-0002 LET IT BE ENOUGH FOR ME TO RELATE HERE THAT HE NEVER FORGAVE THE ACTION BY WHICH SHE THWARTED HIM IN HIS MERCENARY DESIGNS UPON ME AND UPON MY FAMILY THAT HE DIVERTED FROM HIMSELF THE SUSPICION AND DISGUST OF HIS WIFE'S SURVIVING RELATIVES
6145-54685-0003 WHOSE HOSTILITY HE HAD SOME PECUNIARY REASONS TO FEAR BY ACCUSING HIS DAUGHTER AS HE HAD DECLARED HE WOULD ACCUSE HER OF HAVING BEEN THE REAL CAUSE OF HER MOTHER'S DEATH AND THAT HE TOOK CARE TO GIVE THE APPEARANCE OF SINCERITY TO THE INDIGNATION WHICH HE PROFESSED TO FEEL AGAINST HER
6145-54685-0004 BY REFUSING TO FOLLOW HER REMAINS TO THE PLACE OF BURIAL
6145-54685-0005 WITH AN AFFECTIONATE EARNESTNESS THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN HIM DISPLAY TOWARDS ME BEFORE BUT MISTER BERNARD HAD GENEROUSLY UNDERTAKEN TO RELIEVE ME OF EVERY RESPONSIBILITY WHICH COULD BE ASSUMED BY OTHERS AND ON THIS OCCASION THEREFORE
6145-54685-0006 I HAD NO NEED TO PUT MY BROTHER'S READY KINDNESS IN HELPING ME TO THE TEST I STOOD ALONE BY THE GRAVE MISTER BERNARD HAD TAKEN LEAVE OF ME THE WORKERS AND THE IDLERS IN THE CHURCHYARD HAD ALIKE DEPARTED THERE WAS NO REASON WHY I SHOULD NOT FOLLOW THEM
6145-54685-0007 AND YET I REMAINED WITH MY EYES FIXED UPON THE FRESHLY TURNED EARTH AT MY FEET THINKING OF THE DEAD SOME TIME HAD PASSED THUS WHEN THE SOUND OF APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION I LOOKED UP AND SAW A MAN CLOTHED IN A LONG CLOAK DRAWN LOOSELY AROUND HIS NECK
6145-54685-0008 ADVANCING SLOWLY TOWARDS ME WALKING WITH THE HELP OF A STICK HE CAME ON STRAIGHT TO THE GRAVE AND STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF IT STOPPED OPPOSITE ME AS I STOOD AT THE HEAD DO YOU KNOW ME AGAIN HE SAID
6145-54685-0009 DO YOU KNOW ME FOR ROBERT MANNION AS HE PRONOUNCED HIS NAME HE RAISED THE SHADE AND LOOKED AT ME
6145-54685-0010 WITH ITS GHASTLY DISCOLOURATION OF SICKNESS ITS HIDEOUS DEFORMITY OF FEATURE ITS FIERCE AND CHANGELESS MALIGNITY OF EXPRESSION GLARING FULL ON ME IN THE PIERCING NOONDAY SUNSHINE GLARING WITH THE SAME UNEARTHLY LOOK OF FURY AND TRIUMPH
6145-54685-0011 WHICH I HAD SEEN FLASHING THROUGH THE FLASHING LIGHTNING WHEN I PARTED FROM HIM ON THE NIGHT OF THE STORM STRUCK ME SPEECHLESS WHERE I STOOD AND HAS NEVER LEFT ME SINCE I MUST NOT I DARE NOT DESCRIBE THAT FRIGHTFUL SIGHT THOUGH IT NOW RISES BEFORE MY IMAGINATION
6145-54685-0012 VIVID IN ITS HORROR AS ON THE FIRST DAY WHEN I SAW IT THOUGH IT MOVES HITHER AND THITHER BEFORE ME FEARFULLY WHILE I WRITE THOUGH IT LOWERS AT MY WINDOW A NOISOME SHADOW ON THE RADIANT PROSPECT OF EARTH AND SEA AND SKY
6145-54685-0013 IF HE HAD SEEN HIM ON THE MORNING OF HIS EXECUTION STANDING UNDER THE GALLOWS WITH THE CAP OVER HIS FACE STILL I COULD NEITHER SPEAK NOR MOVE I COULD ONLY LOOK AWAY FROM HIM IN HORROR AND FIX MY EYES ON THE GROUND
6145-54685-0014 HE LOWERED THE SHADE TO ITS FORMER POSITION ON HIS FACE THEN SPOKE AGAIN UNDER THIS EARTH THAT WE STAND ON HE SAID SETTING HIS FOOT ON THE GRAVE DOWN HERE WHERE YOU ARE NOW LOOKING LIES BURIED WITH THE BURIED DEAD
6145-54685-0015 DID YOU THINK OF THE ONE LAST CHANCE THAT YOU WERE LOSING WHEN YOU CAME TO SEE HER DIE I WATCHED YOU AND I WATCHED HER I HEARD AS MUCH AS YOU HEARD I SAW AS MUCH AS YOU SAW I KNOW WHEN SHE DIED AND HOW AS YOU KNOW IT
6145-54685-0016 I SHARED HER LAST MOMENTS WITH YOU TO THE VERY END IT WAS MY FANCY NOT TO GIVE HER UP AS YOUR SOLE POSSESSION EVEN ON HER DEATH BED IT IS MY FANCY NOW NOT TO LET YOU STAND ALONE AS IF HER CORPSE WAS YOUR PROPERTY
6145-54685-0017 OVER HER GRAVE WHILE HE UTTERED THE LAST WORDS I FELT MY SELF POSSESSION RETURNING I COULD NOT FORCE MYSELF TO SPEAK AS I WOULD FAIN HAVE SPOKEN I COULD ONLY MOVE AWAY TO LEAVE HIM STOP HE SAID
6145-54685-0018 WHAT I HAVE STILL TO SAY CONCERNS YOU I HAVE TO TELL YOU FACE TO FACE STANDING WITH YOU HERE OVER HER DEAD BODY THAT WHAT I WROTE FROM THE HOSPITAL IS WHAT I WILL DO THAT I WILL MAKE YOUR WHOLE LIFE TO COME ONE LONG EXPIATION OF THIS DEFORMITY
6145-54685-0019 AND OF THAT DEATH HE SET HIS FOOT ONCE MORE ON THE GRAVE GO WHERE YOU WILL THIS FACE OF MINE SHALL NEVER BE TURNED AWAY FROM YOU THIS TONGUE WHICH YOU CAN NEVER SILENCE BUT BY A CRIME SHALL AWAKEN AGAINST YOU THE SLEEPING SUPERSTITIONS AND CRUELTIES OF ALL MANKIND
6145-54685-0020 THE NOISOME SECRET OF THAT NIGHT WHEN YOU FOLLOWED US SHALL REEK UP LIKE A PESTILENCE IN THE NOSTRILS OF YOUR FELLOW BEINGS BE THEY WHOM THEY MAY YOU MAY SHIELD YOURSELF BEHIND YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR FRIENDS I WILL STRIKE AT YOU THROUGH THE DEAREST AND THE BRAVEST OF THEM
6145-54685-0021 NOW YOU HAVE HEARD ME GO THE NEXT TIME WE MEET YOU SHALL ACKNOWLEDGE WITH YOUR OWN LIPS THAT I CAN ACT AS I SPEAK LIVE THE FREE LIFE WHICH MARGARET SHERWIN HAS RESTORED TO YOU BY HER DEATH YOU WILL KNOW IT SOON FOR THE LIFE OF CAIN
6145-54685-0022 HE TURNED FROM THE GRAVE AND LEFT ME BY THE WAY THAT HE HAD COME BUT THE HIDEOUS IMAGE OF HIM AND THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN NEVER LEFT ME NEVER FOR A MOMENT WHILE I LINGERED ALONE IN THE CHURCHYARD NEVER WHEN I QUITTED IT
6145-54685-0023 AND WALKED THROUGH THE CROWDED STREETS THE HORROR OF THE FIEND FACE WAS STILL BEFORE MY EYES
6145-54685-0024 AND FOUND RALPH WAITING TO SEE ME AS SOON AS I ENTERED MY ROOM AT LAST YOU HAVE COME BACK HE SAID I WAS DETERMINED TO STOP TILL YOU DID IF I STAYED ALL DAY IS ANYTHING THE MATTER HAVE YOU GOT INTO SOME WORSE DIFFICULTY THAN EVER NO RALPH NO

6145-54685-0027 AFTER HAVING FORBIDDEN HER EVER TO ENTER THIS HOUSE AGAIN HE NOW ONLY SHOWS HOW HE IS OFFENDED BY HIS SILENCE AND IT IS EXACTLY THAT OF COURSE WHICH DISTRESSES HER BETWEEN HER NOTIONS OF IMPLICIT OBEDIENCE TO HIM AND HER OPPOSITE NOTIONS JUST AS STRONG OF HER SISTERLY DUTIES TO YOU
6145-54685-0028 SHE IS MADE MISERABLE FROM MORNING TO NIGHT WHAT SHE WILL END IN IF THINGS GO ON LIKE THIS I AM REALLY AFRAID TO THINK AND I'M NOT EASILY FRIGHTENED AS YOU KNOW NOW BASIL LISTEN TO ME IT IS YOUR BUSINESS TO STOP THIS AND MY BUSINESS TO TELL YOU HOW I WILL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH

6145-54685-0030 SAYING THAT YOU HAVE GONE AWAY FOR YOUR HEALTH FOR CHANGE OF SCENE AND PEACE OF MIND GONE AWAY IN SHORT TO COME BACK BETTER SOME DAY DON'T SAY WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND DON'T TELL ME FOR SHE IS SURE TO ASK AND SURE TO GET IT OUT OF ME IF I KNOW
6145-54685-0031 THEN SHE MIGHT BE WRITING TO YOU AND THAT MIGHT BE FOUND OUT TOO SHE CAN'T DISTRESS HERSELF ABOUT YOUR ABSENCE IF YOU ACCOUNT FOR IT PROPERLY AS SHE DISTRESSES HERSELF NOW THAT IS ONE CONSIDERATION AND YOU WILL SERVE YOUR OWN INTERESTS AS WELL AS CLARA'S BY GOING AWAY
6145-54685-0032 THAT IS ANOTHER NEVER MIND MY INTERESTS CLARA I CAN ONLY THINK OF CLARA BUT YOU HAVE INTERESTS AND YOU MUST THINK OF THEM I TOLD MY FATHER OF THE DEATH OF THAT UNHAPPY WOMAN AND OF YOUR NOBLE BEHAVIOUR WHEN SHE WAS DYING
6145-54685-0033 DON'T INTERRUPT ME BASIL IT WAS NOBLE I COULDN'T HAVE DONE WHAT YOU DID I CAN TELL YOU I SAW HE WAS MORE STRUCK BY IT THAN HE WAS WILLING TO CONFESS AN IMPRESSION HAS BEEN MADE ON HIM BY THE TURN CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE TAKEN ONLY LEAVE THAT IMPRESSION TO STRENGTHEN AND YOU'RE SAFE
6145-54685-0034 BUT IF YOU DESTROY IT BY STAYING HERE AFTER WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND KEEPING CLARA IN THIS NEW DILEMMA MY DEAR FELLOW YOU DESTROY YOUR BEST CHANCE THERE IS A SORT OF DEFIANCE OF HIM IN STOPPING THERE IS A DOWNRIGHT CONCESSION TO HIM IN GOING AWAY I WILL GO RALPH
6145-54685-0035 YOU HAVE MORE THAN CONVINCED ME THAT I OUGHT I WILL GO TO MORROW THOUGH WHERE YOU HAVE THE REST OF THE DAY TO THINK WHERE I SHOULD GO ABROAD AND AMUSE MYSELF BUT YOUR IDEAS OF AMUSEMENT ARE MOST LIKELY NOT MINE
6145-54685-0036 AT ANY RATE WHEREVER YOU GO I CAN ALWAYS SUPPLY YOU WITH MONEY WHEN YOU WANT IT YOU CAN WRITE TO ME AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN AWAY SOME LITTLE TIME AND I CAN WRITE BACK AS SOON AS I HAVE GOOD NEWS TO TELL YOU
6145-54685-0037 AND I'LL ANSWER FOR IT YOU WILL BE BACK IN YOUR OWN STUDY AT HOME BEFORE YOU ARE MANY MONTHS OLDER I WILL PUT IT OUT OF MY POWER TO FAIL IN MY RESOLUTION BY WRITING TO CLARA AT ONCE AND GIVING YOU THE LETTER TO PLACE IN HER HANDS TO MORROW EVENING WHEN I SHALL HAVE LEFT LONDON SOME HOURS
6145-54685-0038 THAT'S RIGHT BASIL THAT'S ACTING AND SPEAKING LIKE A MAN I WROTE IMMEDIATELY ACCOUNTING FOR MY SUDDEN ABSENCE AS RALPH HAD ADVISED ME WROTE WITH A HEAVY HEART ALL THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE MOST REASSURING AND CHEERING TO CLARA AND THEN
6145-54685-0039 WITHOUT ALLOWING MYSELF TIME TO HESITATE OR TO THINK GAVE THE LETTER TO MY BROTHER SHE SHALL HAVE IT TO MORROW NIGHT HE SAID AND MY FATHER SHALL KNOW WHY YOU HAVE LEFT TOWN AT THE SAME TIME DEPEND ON ME IN THIS AS IN EVERYTHING ELSE AND NOW BASIL I MUST SAY GOOD BYE
6145-54685-0040 UNLESS YOU'RE IN THE HUMOUR FOR COMING TO LOOK AT MY NEW HOUSE THIS EVENING AH I SEE THAT WON'T SUIT YOU JUST NOW SO GOOD BYE OLD FELLOW WRITE WHEN YOU ARE IN ANY NECESSITY GET BACK YOUR SPIRITS AND YOUR HEALTH AND NEVER DOUBT THAT THE STEP YOU ARE NOW TAKING WILL BE THE BEST FOR CLARA
6145-54685-0041 AND THE BEST FOR YOURSELF HE HURRIED OUT OF THE ROOM EVIDENTLY FEELING MORE AT SAYING FAREWELL THAN HE WAS WILLING TO LET ME DISCOVER I WAS LEFT ALONE FOR THE REST OF THE DAY TO THINK WHITHER I SHOULD TURN MY STEPS ON THE MORROW I KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE BEST THAT I SHOULD LEAVE ENGLAND
6145-54685-0042 A YEARNING TOWARDS MY OWN COUNTRY THAT I HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE A HOME SICKNESS FOR THE LAND IN WHICH MY SISTER LIVED NOT ONCE DID MY THOUGHTS WANDER AWAY TO FOREIGN PLACES WHILE I NOW TRIED TO CONSIDER CALMLY IN WHAT DIRECTION I SHOULD DEPART WHEN I LEFT LONDON
6145-54685-0043 BY THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE SCENERY THE CUSTOMS AND THE PEOPLE OF HER NATIVE LAND WITH WHICH SHE WAS EVER READY TO AMUSE ME AS I GREW OLDER IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PROJECTS TO GO TO CORNWALL TO EXPLORE THE WILD WESTERN LAND ON FOOT FROM HILL TO HILL THROUGHOUT AND NOW
6145-54685-0044 WHEN NO MOTIVE OF PLEASURE COULD INFLUENCE MY CHOICE NOW WHEN I WAS GOING FORTH HOMELESS AND ALONE IN UNCERTAINTY IN GRIEF IN PERIL THE OLD FANCY OF LONG PAST DAYS STILL KEPT ITS INFLUENCE AND POINTED OUT MY NEW PATH TO ME AMONG THE ROCKY BOUNDARIES OF THE CORNISH SHORE
6145-54685-0045 MY LAST NIGHT IN LONDON WAS A NIGHT MADE TERRIBLE BY MANNION'S FEARFUL IMAGE IN ALL MY DREAMS MADE MOURNFUL IN MY WAKING MOMENTS BY THOUGHTS OF THE MORROW WHICH WAS TO SEPARATE ME FROM CLARA BUT I NEVER FALTERED IN MY RESOLUTION TO LEAVE LONDON FOR HER SAKE
6145-54685-0046 WHEN THE MORNING CAME I COLLECTED MY FEW NECESSARIES ADDED TO THEM ONE OR TWO BOOKS AND WAS READY TO DEPART MY WAY THROUGH THE STREETS TOOK ME NEAR MY FATHER'S HOUSE AS I PASSED BY THE WELL REMEMBERED NEIGHBOURHOOD MY SELF CONTROL SO FAR DESERTED ME
6145-54685-0047 THAT I STOPPED AND TURNED ASIDE INTO THE SQUARE IN THE HOPE OF SEEING CLARA ONCE MORE BEFORE I WENT AWAY CAUTIOUSLY AND DOUBTFULLY AS IF I WAS A TRESPASSER EVEN ON THE PUBLIC PAVEMENT I LOOKED UP AT THE HOUSE WHICH WAS NO MORE MY HOME AT THE WINDOWS SIDE BY SIDE OF MY SISTER'S SITTING ROOM AND BED ROOM
6145-54685-0048 SHE WAS NEITHER STANDING NEAR THEM NOR PASSING ACCIDENTALLY FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER AT THAT MOMENT STILL I COULD NOT PERSUADE MYSELF TO GO ON I THOUGHT OF MANY AND MANY AN ACT OF KINDNESS THAT SHE HAD DONE FOR ME WHICH I SEEMED NEVER TO HAVE APPRECIATED UNTIL NOW
6145-54685-0049 I THOUGHT OF WHAT SHE HAD SUFFERED AND MIGHT YET SUFFER FOR MY SAKE AND THE LONGING TO SEE HER ONCE MORE THOUGH ONLY FOR AN INSTANT STILL KEPT ME LINGERING NEAR THE HOUSE AND LOOKING UP VAINLY AT THE LONELY WINDOWS IT WAS A BRIGHT COOL AUTUMNAL MORNING
6145-54685-0050 IT USED OFTEN TO BE HER HABIT WHEN I WAS AT HOME TO GO THERE AND READ AT THIS HOUR I WALKED ROUND OUTSIDE THE RAILINGS
6145-54685-0051 AND HAD NEARLY MADE THE CIRCUIT OF THE GARDEN THUS BEFORE THE FIGURE OF A LADY SITTING ALONE UNDER ONE OF THE TREES ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION I STOPPED LOOKED INTENTLY TOWARDS HER AND SAW THAT IT WAS CLARA HER FACE WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY TURNED FROM ME BUT I KNEW HER BY HER DRESS
6145-54685-0052 BY HER FIGURE EVEN BY HER POSITION SIMPLE AS IT WAS SHE WAS SITTING WITH HER HANDS ON A CLOSED BOOK WHICH RESTED ON HER KNEE A LITTLE SPANIEL THAT I HAD GIVEN HER LAY ASLEEP AT HER FEET SHE SEEMED TO BE LOOKING DOWN AT THE ANIMAL AS FAR AS I COULD TELL BY THE POSITION OF HER HEAD
6145-54685-0053 WHEN I MOVED ASIDE TO TRY IF I COULD SEE HER FACE THE TREES HID HER FROM SIGHT I WAS OBLIGED TO BE SATISFIED WITH THE LITTLE I COULD DISCERN OF HER THROUGH THE ONE GAP IN THE FOLIAGE WHICH GAVE ME A CLEAR VIEW OF THE PLACE WHERE SHE WAS SITTING TO SPEAK TO HER
6145-54685-0054 TO RISK THE MISERY TO BOTH OF US OF SAYING FAREWELL WAS MORE THAN I DARED TRUST MYSELF TO DO I COULD ONLY STAND SILENT AND LOOK AT HER IT MIGHT BE FOR THE LAST TIME UNTIL THE TEARS GATHERED IN MY EYES SO THAT I COULD SEE NOTHING MORE
6145-54685-0055 I RESISTED THE TEMPTATION TO DASH THEM AWAY WHILE THEY STILL HID HER FROM ME WHILE I COULD NOT SEE HER AGAIN IF I WOULD I TURNED FROM THE GARDEN VIEW AND LEFT THE SQUARE
6145-54685-0056 AMID ALL THE THOUGHTS WHICH THRONGED ON ME AS I WALKED FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF WHAT WAS ONCE MY HOME AMID ALL THE REMEMBRANCES OF PAST EVENTS FROM THE FIRST DAY WHEN I MET MARGARET SHERWIN TO THE DAY WHEN I STOOD BY HER GRAVE WHICH WERE RECALLED BY THE MERE ACT OF LEAVING LONDON
6145-54685-0057 THERE NOW AROSE IN MY MIND FOR THE FIRST TIME A DOUBT WHICH FROM THAT DAY TO THIS HAS NEVER LEFT IT A DOUBT WHETHER MANNION MIGHT NOT BE TRACKING ME IN SECRET ALONG EVERY STEP OF MY WAY I STOPPED INSTINCTIVELY AND LOOKED BEHIND ME MANY FIGURES WERE MOVING IN THE DISTANCE
6145-54685-0058 AFTER THIS I LET A LONGER INTERVAL ELAPSE BEFORE I STOPPED AND THEN FOR THE THIRD TIME I TURNED ROUND AND SCANNED THE BUSY STREET SCENE BEHIND ME WITH EAGER SUSPICIOUS EYES
6145-54685-0059 I CAUGHT SIGHT OF A MAN WHO WAS STANDING STILL AS I WAS STANDING AMID THE MOVING THRONG HIS HEIGHT WAS LIKE MANNION'S HEIGHT AND HE WORE A CLOAK LIKE THE CLOAK I HAD SEEN ON MANNION WHEN HE APPROACHED ME AT MARGARET'S GRAVE MORE THAN THIS I COULD NOT DETECT WITHOUT CROSSING OVER
6145-54685-0060 THE PASSING VEHICLES AND FOOT PASSENGERS CONSTANTLY INTERCEPTED MY VIEW FROM THE POSITION IN WHICH I STOOD WAS THIS FIGURE THUS VISIBLE ONLY BY INTERVALS THE FIGURE OF MANNION AND WAS HE REALLY TRACKING MY STEPS AS THE SUSPICION STRENGTHENED IN MY MIND THAT IT WAS SO
6145-54685-0061 YOU MAY SHIELD YOURSELF BEHIND YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR FRIENDS I WILL STRIKE AT YOU THROUGH THE DEAREST AND THE BRAVEST OF THEM SUDDENLY RECURRED TO ME AND BROUGHT WITH IT A THOUGHT WHICH URGED ME INSTANTLY TO PROCEED ON MY WAY I NEVER LOOKED BEHIND ME AGAIN AS I NOW WALKED ON
6145-54685-0062 FOR I SAID WITHIN MYSELF IF HE IS FOLLOWING ME I MUST NOT AND WILL NOT AVOID HIM IT WILL BE THE BEST RESULT OF MY DEPARTURE THAT I SHALL DRAW AFTER ME THAT DESTROYING PRESENCE AND THUS AT LEAST REMOVE IT FAR AND SAFELY AWAY FROM MY FAMILY
6145-54685-0063 AND MY HOME SO I NEITHER TURNED ASIDE FROM THE STRAIGHT DIRECTION NOR HURRIED MY STEPS NOR LOOKED BACK ANY MORE AT THE TIME I HAD RESOLVED ON I LEFT LONDON FOR CORNWALL WITHOUT MAKING ANY ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL MY DEPARTURE
6145-54685-0064 AND THOUGH I KNEW THAT HE MUST SURELY BE FOLLOWING ME STILL I NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN NEVER DISCOVERED HOW CLOSE OR HOW FAR OFF HE WAS ON MY TRACK TWO MONTHS HAVE PASSED SINCE THAT PERIOD
