7708-290368-0000 THIRDLY TRUE OR FALSE FIRST BY REAL IDEAS I MEAN SUCH AS HAVE A FOUNDATION IN NATURE
7708-290368-0001 FANTASTICAL OR CHIMERICAL I CALL SUCH AS HAVE NO FOUNDATION IN NATURE NOR HAVE ANY CONFORMITY WITH THAT REALITY OF BEING TO WHICH THEY ARE TACITLY REFERRED AS TO THEIR ARCHETYPES IF WE EXAMINE THE SEVERAL SORTS OF IDEAS BEFORE MENTIONED WE SHALL FIND THAT
7708-290368-0002 SIMPLE IDEAS ARE ALL REAL APPEARANCES OF THINGS FIRST OUR SIMPLE IDEAS ARE ALL REAL ALL AGREE TO THE REALITY OF THINGS NOT THAT THEY ARE ALL OF THEM THE IMAGES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF WHAT DOES EXIST THE CONTRARY WHEREOF
7708-290368-0003 IN ALL BUT THE PRIMARY QUALITIES OF BODIES HATH BEEN ALREADY SHOWN BUT THOUGH WHITENESS AND COLDNESS ARE NO MORE IN SNOW THAN PAIN IS
7708-290368-0004 BEING IN US THE EFFECTS OF POWERS IN THINGS WITHOUT US ORDAINED BY OUR MAKER TO PRODUCE IN US SUCH SENSATIONS THEY ARE REAL IDEAS IN US WHEREBY WE DISTINGUISH THE QUALITIES THAT ARE REALLY IN THINGS THEMSELVES
7708-290368-0005 WHICH WE HAVE TO DO WITH OUR IDEAS DO AS WELL SERVE US TO THAT PURPOSE AND ARE AS REAL DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERS WHETHER THEY BE ONLY CONSTANT EFFECTS OR ELSE EXACT RESEMBLANCES OF SOMETHING IN THE THINGS THEMSELVES
7708-290368-0006 THE REALITY LYING IN THAT STEADY CORRESPONDENCE THEY HAVE WITH THE DISTINCT CONSTITUTIONS OF REAL BEINGS BUT WHETHER THEY ANSWER TO THOSE CONSTITUTIONS AS TO CAUSES OR PATTERNS IT MATTERS NOT IT SUFFICES THAT THEY ARE CONSTANTLY PRODUCED BY THEM
7708-290368-0007 AND THUS OUR SIMPLE IDEAS ARE ALL REAL AND TRUE BECAUSE THEY ANSWER AND AGREE TO THOSE POWERS OF THINGS WHICH PRODUCE THEM ON OUR MINDS THAT BEING ALL THAT IS REQUISITE TO MAKE THEM REAL AND NOT FICTIONS AT PLEASURE FOR IN SIMPLE IDEAS AS HAS BEEN SHOWN
7708-290368-0008 THE MIND IS WHOLLY CONFINED TO THE OPERATION OF THINGS UPON IT AND CAN MAKE TO ITSELF NO SIMPLE IDEA MORE THAN WHAT IT WAS RECEIVED
7708-290368-0009 COMPLEX IDEAS ARE VOLUNTARY COMBINATIONS THOUGH THE MIND BE WHOLLY PASSIVE IN RESPECT OF ITS SIMPLE IDEAS YET I THINK WE MAY SAY IT IS NOT SO IN RESPECT OF ITS COMPLEX IDEAS
7708-290368-0010 FOR THOSE BEING COMBINATIONS OF SIMPLE IDEAS PUT TOGETHER AND UNITED UNDER ONE GENERAL NAME IT IS PLAIN THAT THE MIND OF MAN USES SOME KIND OF LIBERTY IN FORMING THOSE COMPLEX IDEAS
7708-290368-0011 BUT BECAUSE HE HAS PUT IN OR LEFT OUT OF HIS SOME SIMPLE IDEA WHICH THE OTHER HAS NOT THE QUESTION THEN IS WHICH OF THESE ARE REAL AND WHICH BARELY IMAGINARY COMBINATIONS WHAT COLLECTIONS AGREE TO THE REALITY OF THINGS AND WHAT NOT AND TO THIS I SAY THAT
7708-290368-0012 MIXED MODES AND RELATIONS MADE OF CONSISTENT IDEAS ARE REAL SECONDLY MIXED MODES AND RELATIONS HAVING NO OTHER REALITY BUT WHAT THEY HAVE IN THE MINDS OF MEN THERE IS NOTHING MORE REQUIRED TO THIS KIND OF IDEAS TO MAKE THEM REAL
7708-290368-0013 BUT THAT THEY BE SO FRAMED THAT THERE BE A POSSIBILITY OF EXISTING CONFORMABLE TO THEM THESE IDEAS THEMSELVES BEING ARCHETYPES CANNOT DIFFER FROM THEIR ARCHETYPES AND SO CANNOT BE CHIMERICAL UNLESS ANY ONE WILL JUMBLE TOGETHER IN THEM INCONSISTENT IDEAS
7708-290368-0014 INDEED AS ANY OF THEM HAVE THE NAMES OF A KNOWN LANGUAGE ASSIGNED TO THEM BY WHICH HE THAT HAS THEM IN HIS MIND WOULD SIGNIFY THEM TO OTHERS SO BARE POSSIBILITY OF EXISTING IS NOT ENOUGH THEY MUST HAVE A CONFORMITY TO THE ORDINARY SIGNIFICATION
7708-290368-0015 OF THE NAME THAT IS GIVEN THEM THAT THEY MAY NOT BE THOUGHT FANTASTICAL AS IF A MAN WOULD GIVE THE NAME OF JUSTICE TO THAT IDEA WHICH COMMON USE CALLS LIBERALITY BUT THIS FANTASTICALNESS
7708-290368-0016 FOR A MAN TO BE UNDISTURBED IN DANGER SEDATELY TO CONSIDER WHAT IS FITTEST TO BE DONE AND TO EXECUTE IT STEADILY IS A MIXED MODE OR A COMPLEX IDEA OF AN ACTION WHICH MAY EXIST BUT TO BE UNDISTURBED IN DANGER WITHOUT USING ONE'S REASON OR INDUSTRY
7708-290368-0017 IS WHAT IS ALSO POSSIBLE TO BE AND SO IS AS REAL AN IDEA AS THE OTHER THOUGH THE FIRST OF THESE HAVING THE NAME COURAGE GIVEN TO IT MAY IN RESPECT OF THAT NAME BE A RIGHT OR WRONG IDEA
7708-290368-0018 BUT THE OTHER WHILST IT HAS NOT A COMMON RECEIVED NAME OF ANY KNOWN LANGUAGE ASSIGNED TO IT IS NOT CAPABLE OF ANY DEFORMITY BEING MADE WITH NO REFERENCE TO ANYTHING BUT ITSELF
7708-290368-0019 COMPLEX IDEAS OF SUBSTANCES ARE REAL WHEN THEY AGREE WITH THE EXISTENCE OF THINGS THIRDLY OUR COMPLEX IDEAS OF SUBSTANCES BEING MADE ALL OF THEM IN REFERENCE TO THINGS EXISTING WITHOUT US
7708-290368-0020 AND INTENDED TO BE REPRESENTATIONS OF SUBSTANCES AS THEY REALLY ARE ARE NO FURTHER REAL THAN AS THEY ARE SUCH COMBINATIONS OF SIMPLE IDEAS AS ARE REALLY UNITED AND CO EXIST IN THINGS WITHOUT US ON THE CONTRARY
7708-290368-0021 THOSE ARE FANTASTICAL WHICH ARE MADE UP OF SUCH COLLECTIONS OF SIMPLE IDEAS AS WERE REALLY NEVER UNITED NEVER WERE FOUND TOGETHER IN ANY SUBSTANCE
7708-290368-0022 OR A BODY YELLOW VERY MALLEABLE FUSIBLE AND FIXED BUT LIGHTER THAN COMMON WATER OR AN UNIFORM UNORGANIZED BODY CONSISTING AS TO SENSE ALL OF SIMILAR PARTS WITH PERCEPTION AND VOLUNTARY MOTION JOINED TO IT
7708-290368-0023 WHETHER SUCH SUBSTANCES AS THESE CAN POSSIBLY EXIST OR NO IT IS PROBABLE WE DO NOT KNOW BUT BE THAT AS IT WILL THESE IDEAS OF SUBSTANCES BEING MADE CONFORMABLE TO NO PATTERN EXISTING THAT WE KNOW
