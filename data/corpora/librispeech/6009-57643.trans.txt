6009-57643-0000 CATHOLICITY THAT CATHOLICITY IS A PROMINENT NOTE OF THE CHURCH IS EVIDENT FROM THE APOSTLES CREED WHICH SAYS I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH THE WORD CATHOLIC OR UNIVERSAL
6009-57643-0001 SIGNIFIES THAT THE TRUE CHURCH IS NOT CIRCUMSCRIBED IN ITS EXTENT LIKE HUMAN EMPIRES NOR CONFINED TO ONE RACE OF PEOPLE LIKE THE JEWISH CHURCH BUT THAT SHE IS DIFFUSED OVER EVERY NATION OF THE GLOBE AND COUNTS HER CHILDREN AMONG ALL TRIBES AND PEOPLES AND TONGUES OF THE EARTH
6009-57643-0002 HE ASSIGNED TO THEM THE WHOLE WORLD AS THE THEATRE OF THEIR LABORS AND THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE WITHOUT REGARD TO LANGUAGE COLOR OR NATIONALITY AS THE AUDIENCE TO WHOM THEY WERE TO PREACH UNLIKE THE RELIGION OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE WHICH WAS NATIONAL
6009-57643-0003 OR THAT OF THE MOHAMMEDANS WHICH IS LOCAL THE CATHOLIC RELIGION WAS TO BE COSMOPOLITAN EMBRACING ALL NATIONS AND ALL COUNTRIES THIS IS EVIDENT FROM THE FOLLOWING PASSAGES
6009-57643-0004 MAY NOT STRIKE US TODAY AS ESPECIALLY REMARKABLE ACCUSTOMED AS WE ARE NOW TO MEET WITH CHRISTIAN CIVILIZATION EVERYWHERE
6009-57643-0005 BOUND SO CLOSELY TOGETHER BY SOCIAL AND COMMERCIAL RELATIONS BUT WE MUST REMEMBER THAT WHEN THEY WERE UTTERED THE TRUE GOD WAS KNOWN AND ADORED ONLY IN AN OBSCURE ALMOST ISOLATED CORNER OF THE EARTH WHILE TRIUMPHANT IDOLATRY
6009-57643-0006 WAS THE OTHERWISE UNIVERSAL RELIGION OF THE WORLD THE PROPHECIES WERE FULFILLED THE APOSTLES SCATTERED THEMSELVES OVER THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH PREACHING THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST THEIR SOUND SAYS SAINT PAUL
6009-57643-0007 I GIVE THANKS TO MY GOD THROUGH JESUS CHRIST BECAUSE YOUR FAITH IS SPOKEN OF IN THE ENTIRE WORLD
6009-57643-0008 WITH THE FAITH OF THE ROMANS SAINT JUSTIN MARTYR WAS ABLE TO SAY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER CHRIST THAT THERE WAS NO RACE OF MEN
6009-57643-0009 AMONG WHOM THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST WAS NOT INVOKED SAINT IRENAEUS WRITING AT THE END OF THE SECOND CENTURY TELLS US THAT THE RELIGION SO MARVELOUSLY PROPAGATED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE WORLD WAS NOT A VAGUE EVER CHANGING FORM OF CHRISTIANITY
6009-57643-0010 BUT THAT THIS FAITH AND DOCTRINE AND TRADITION PREACHED THROUGHOUT THE GLOBE IS AS UNIFORM AS IF THE CHURCH CONSISTED OF ONE FAMILY POSSESSING ONE SOUL ONE HEART AND AS IF SHE HAD BUT ONE MOUTH FOR THOUGH THE LANGUAGES OF THE WORLD ARE DISSIMILAR
6009-57643-0011 HER DOCTRINE IS THE SAME THE CHURCHES FOUNDED IN GERMANY IN THE CELTIC NATIONS IN THE EAST IN EGYPT IN LYBIA AND IN THE CENTRES OF CIVILIZATION DO NOT DIFFER FROM EACH OTHER BUT AS THE SUN GIVES THE SAME LIGHT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
6009-57643-0012 SO DOES THE LIGHT OF FAITH SHINE EVERYWHERE THE SAME
6009-57643-0013 AND ALREADY HAVE WE FILLED YOUR CITIES TOWNS ISLANDS YOUR COUNCIL HALLS AND CAMPS THE PALACE SENATE FORUM
6009-57643-0014 AT THE END OF THE SECOND CENTURY WRITES THE WORD OF OUR MASTER DID NOT REMAIN IN JUDEA AS PHILOSOPHY REMAINED IN GREECE BUT HAS BEEN POURED OUT OVER THE WHOLE WORLD PERSUADING GREEKS AND BARBARIANS ALIKE RACE BY RACE VILLAGE BY VILLAGE
6009-57643-0015 AND ORIGEN IN THE EARLY PART OF THE NEXT CENTURY OBSERVES IN ALL GREECE AND IN ALL BARBAROUS RACES WITHIN OUR WORLD
6009-57643-0016 FOR THE LAW OF MOSES AND THE WORD OF JESUS CHRIST THOUGH TO ADHERE TO THAT LAW IS TO INCUR THE HATRED OF IDOLATERS AND THE RISK OF DEATH BESIDES TO HAVE EMBRACED THAT WORD AND CONSIDERING HOW IN SO FEW YEARS IN SPITE OF THE ATTACK MADE ON US
6009-57643-0017 EVEN TO THE LOSS OF LIFE OR PROPERTY AND WITH NO GREAT STORE OF TEACHERS THE PREACHING OF THAT WORD HAS FOUND ITS WAY INTO EVERY PART OF THE WORLD SO THAT GREEK AND BARBARIAN WISE AND UNWISE ADHERE TO THE RELIGION OF JESUS
6009-57643-0018 DOUBTLESS IT IS A WORK GREATER THAN ANY WORK OF MAN THIS CATHOLICITY OR UNIVERSALITY IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN ANY OR IN ALL OF THE COMBINED COMMUNIONS SEPARATED FROM THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH
6009-57643-0019 THE SCHISMATIC CHURCHES OF THE EAST HAVE NO CLAIM TO THIS TITLE BECAUSE THEY ARE CONFINED WITHIN THE TURKISH AND RUSSIAN DOMINIONS AND NUMBER NOT MORE THAN SIXTY MILLION SOULS THE PROTESTANT CHURCHES EVEN TAKEN COLLECTIVELY
6009-57643-0020 AS SEPARATE COMMUNIONS THEY ARE A MERE HANDFUL ARE TOO INSIGNIFICANT IN POINT OF NUMBERS AND TOO CIRCUMSCRIBED IN THEIR TERRITORIAL EXTENT TO HAVE ANY PRETENSIONS TO THE TITLE OF CATHOLIC
6009-57643-0021 ALL THE PROTESTANT DENOMINATIONS ARE ESTIMATED AT SIXTY FIVE MILLION OR LESS THAN ONE FIFTH OF THOSE WHO BEAR THE CHRISTIAN NAME
6009-57643-0022 I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH THAT THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH ALONE DESERVES THE NAME OF CATHOLIC IS SO EVIDENT THAT IT IS RIDICULOUS TO DENY IT OURS IS THE ONLY CHURCH WHICH ADOPTS THIS NAME AS HER OFFICIAL TITLE
6009-57643-0023 WE HAVE POSSESSION WHICH IS NINE TENTHS OF THE LAW WE HAVE EXCLUSIVELY BORNE THIS GLORIOUS APPELLATION IN TROUBLED TIMES WHEN THE ASSUMPTION OF THIS VENERABLE TITLE EXPOSED US TO INSULT PERSECUTION AND DEATH
6009-57643-0024 AND TO ATTEMPT TO DEPRIVE US OF IT AT THIS LATE HOUR WOULD BE AS FRUITLESS AS THE EFFORTS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONISTS WHO SOUGHT TO UPROOT ALL TRACES OF THE OLD CIVILIZATION BY ASSIGNING NEW NAMES TO THE DAYS AND SEASONS OF THE YEAR
6009-57643-0025 SO GREAT IS THE CHARM ATTACHED TO THE NAME OF CATHOLIC THAT A PORTION OF THE EPISCOPAL BODY SOMETIMES USURP THE TITLE OF CATHOLIC THOUGH IN THEIR OFFICIAL BOOKS THEY ARE NAMED PROTESTANT EPISCOPALIANS IF THEY THINK THAT THEY HAVE
6009-57643-0026 SHOULD A STRANGER ASK THEM TO DIRECT HIM TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH THEY WOULD INSTINCTIVELY POINT OUT TO HIM THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH THE SECTARIANS OF THE FOURTH AND FIFTH CENTURIES AS SAINT AUGUSTINE TELLS US USED TO ATTEMPT THE SAME PIOUS FRAUD
6009-57643-0027 BUT SIGNALLY FAILED WE MUST HOLD FAST TO THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION AND TO THE COMMUNION OF THAT CHURCH WHICH IS CATHOLIC AND WHICH IS CALLED CATHOLIC NOT ONLY BY THOSE WHO BELONG TO HER BUT ALSO BY ALL HER ENEMIES
6009-57643-0028 NOT WITH THEIR OWN BUT WITH OUTSIDERS CALL THAT ONLY CATHOLIC WHICH IS REALLY CATHOLIC FOR THEY CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD UNLESS THEY DISTINGUISH HER BY THAT NAME
6009-57643-0029 NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED ATTENDED THE OPENING SESSION THE REST BEING UNAVOIDABLY ABSENT ALL PARTS OF THE HABITABLE GLOBE WERE REPRESENTED AT THE COUNCIL THE BISHOPS ASSEMBLED FROM GREAT BRITAIN IRELAND FRANCE GERMANY SWITZERLAND
6009-57643-0030 AND FROM ALMOST EVERY NATION AND PRINCIPALITY IN EUROPE THEY MET FROM CANADA THE UNITED STATES MEXICO AND SOUTH AMERICA AND FROM THE ISLANDS OF THE ATLANTIC AND THE PACIFIC THEY WERE GATHERED TOGETHER FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF AFRICA AND OCEANICA
6009-57643-0031 THAT DISTINGUISHED THE HUMAN FAMILY THEY SPOKE EVERY CIVILIZED LANGUAGE UNDER THE SUN KNEELING TOGETHER IN THE SAME GREAT COUNCIL HALL TRULY COULD THOSE PRELATES EXCLAIM IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE APOCALYPSE THOU HAST REDEEMED US O LORD TO GOD IN THY BLOOD
6009-57643-0032 OUT OF EVERY TRIBE AND TONGUE AND PEOPLE
6009-57643-0033 IN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA NEVER IN HER LONG HISTORY WAS SHE NUMERICALLY SO STRONG AS SHE IS AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WHEN HER CHILDREN AMOUNT TO ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLIONS OR DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO BEAR THE NAME OF CHRISTIANS OUTSIDE OF HER COMMUNION
6009-57643-0034 IN HER ALONE
6009-57643-0035 FOR IN EVERY CLIME AND IN EVERY NATION UNDER THE SUN ARE ERECTED THOUSANDS OF CATHOLIC ALTARS
6009-57643-0036 IT IS SAID WITH TRUTH THAT THE SUN NEVER SETS ON BRITISH DOMINIONS IT MAY ALSO BE AFFIRMED WITH EQUAL ASSURANCE
6009-57643-0037 PLANTING THE CROSS THE SYMBOL OF SALVATION SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE BANNER OF SAINT GEORGE QUITE RECENTLY A NUMBER OF EUROPEAN EMIGRANTS ARRIVED IN RICHMOND THEY WERE STRANGERS TO OUR COUNTRY TO OUR CUSTOMS AND TO OUR LANGUAGE
6009-57643-0038 EVERY OBJECT THAT MET THEIR EYE SADLY REMINDED THEM THAT THEY WERE FAR FROM THEIR OWN SUNNY ITALY BUT WHEN THEY SAW THE CROSS SURMOUNTING OUR CATHEDRAL THEY HASTENED TO IT WITH A JOYFUL STEP I SAW AND HEARD A GROUP OF THEM GIVING EARNEST EXPRESSION
6009-57643-0039 TO THEIR DEEP EMOTIONS ENTERING THIS SACRED TEMPLE THEY FELT THAT THEY HAD FOUND AN OASIS IN THE DESERT ONCE MORE THEY WERE AT HOME THEY FOUND ONE FAMILIAR SPOT IN A STRANGE LAND THEY STOOD IN THE CHURCH OF THEIR FATHERS
6009-57643-0040 IN THE HOME OF THEIR CHILDHOOD AND THEY SEEMED TO SAY IN THEIR HEARTS AS A TEAR TRICKLED DOWN THEIR SUN BURNT CHEEKS HOW LOVELY ARE THY TABERNACLES O LORD OF HOSTS MY SOUL LONGETH AND FAINTETH FOR THE COURTS OF THE LORD
6009-57643-0041 WHOM THEY HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO REVERENCE FROM THEIR YOUTH THEY SAW THE BAPTISMAL FONT AND THE CONFESSIONALS THEY BEHELD THE ALTAR AND THE ALTAR RAILS WHERE THEY RECEIVED THEIR MAKER THEY OBSERVED THE PRIEST AT THE ALTAR IN HIS SACRED VESTMENTS THEY SAW A MULTITUDE OF WORSHIPERS KNEELING AROUND THEM
6009-57643-0042 AND THEY FELT IN THEIR HEART OF HEARTS THAT THEY WERE ONCE MORE AMONG BROTHERS AND SISTERS WITH WHOM THEY HAD ONE LORD ONE FAITH ONE BAPTISM ONE GOD AND FATHER OF ALL EVERYWHERE A CATHOLIC IS AT HOME
6009-57643-0043 SECRET SOCIETIES OF WHATEVER NAME FORM BUT A WEAK AND COUNTERFEIT BOND OF UNION COMPARED WITH THE GENUINE FELLOWSHIP CREATED BY CATHOLIC FAITH HOPE AND CHARITY THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH THEN
6009-57643-0044 AND COMPRISE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CHRISTIAN FAMILY GOD FORBID THAT I SHOULD WRITE THESE LINES OR THAT MY CATHOLIC READERS SHOULD PERUSE THEM IN A BOASTING AND VAUNTING SPIRIT GOD ESTIMATES MEN NOT BY THEIR NUMBERS
6009-57643-0045 BUT BY THEIR INTRINSIC WORTH IT IS NO CREDIT TO US TO BELONG TO THE BODY OF THE CHURCH CATHOLIC IF WE ARE NOT UNITED TO THE SOUL OF THE CHURCH BY A LIFE OF FAITH HOPE AND CHARITY IT WILL AVAIL US NOTHING TO BE CITIZENS OF THAT KINGDOM OF CHRIST
6009-57643-0046 WHICH ENCIRCLES THE GLOBE UNLESS THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WITHIN US BY THE REIGN OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN OUR HEARTS ONE RIGHTEOUS SOUL THAT REFLECTS THE BEAUTY AND PERFECTIONS OF THE LORD IS MORE PRECIOUS IN HIS SIGHT THAN THE MASS OF HUMANITY
6009-57643-0047 THAT HAS NO SPIRITUAL LIFE AND IS DEAD TO THE INSPIRATIONS OF GRACE THE PATRIARCH ABRAHAM WAS DEARER TO JEHOVAH THAN ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE CORRUPT CITY OF SODOM
6009-57643-0048 WERE MORE ESTEEMED BY HIM THAN THE GREAT ROMAN EMPIRE WHICH WAS SEATED IN DARKNESS AND THE SHADOW OF DEATH WHILE WE REJOICE THEN IN THE INESTIMABLE BLESSING OF BEING INCORPORATED IN THE VISIBLE BODY OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
6009-57643-0049 WHOSE SPIRITUAL TREASURES ARE INEXHAUSTIBLE
