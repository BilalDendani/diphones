3490-177641-0000 IT'S A STRANGE FEELING JASON SAID I'VE NEVER REALLY SEEN THE PERIMETER FROM THIS SIDE BEFORE UGLY IS ABOUT THE ONLY WORD FOR IT HE LAY ON HIS STOMACH NEXT TO RHES LOOKING THROUGH A SCREEN OF LEAVES DOWNHILL TOWARDS THE PERIMETER
3490-177641-0001 THEY WERE BOTH WRAPPED IN HEAVY FURS IN SPITE OF THE MIDDAY HEAT WITH THICK LEGGINGS AND LEATHER GAUNTLETS TO PROTECT THEIR HANDS THE GRAVITY AND THE HEAT WERE ALREADY MAKING JASON DIZZY BUT HE FORCED HIMSELF TO IGNORE THIS
3490-177641-0002 AHEAD ON THE FAR SIDE OF A BURNT CORRIDOR STOOD THE PERIMETER A HIGH WALL OF VARYING HEIGHT AND TEXTURE SEEMINGLY MADE OF EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHAT IT HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN CONSTRUCTED OF
3490-177641-0003 GENERATIONS OF ATTACKERS HAD BRUISED BROKEN AND UNDERMINED IT REPAIRS HAD BEEN QUICKLY MADE PATCHES THRUST ROUGHLY INTO PLACE AND FIXED THERE CRUDE MASONRY CRUMBLED AND GAVE WAY TO A RAT'S NEST OF WOVEN TIMBERS
3490-177641-0004 THIS OVERLAPPED A LENGTH OF PITTED METAL LARGE PLATES RIVETED TOGETHER EVEN THIS METAL HAD BEEN EATEN THROUGH AND BURSTING SANDBAGS SPILLED OUT OF A JAGGED HOLE OVER THE SURFACE OF THE WALL DETECTOR WIRES AND CHARGED CABLES LOOPED AND HUNG
3490-177641-0005 IT VARIES A SIMPLE SWEEP JUST ENOUGH TO FOOL AN ANIMAL BUT WAS NEVER MEANT TO KEEP MEN OUT LOOK FOR YOURSELF IT FIRES AT REGULARLY REPEATED TWO FOUR THREE AND ONE MINUTE INTERVALS THEY CRAWLED BACK TO THE HOLLOW WHERE NAXA AND THE OTHERS WAITED FOR THEM
3490-177641-0006 NAXA IS KEEPING THE LARGER ANIMALS AWAY AND YOU ALL CAN HANDLE THE SMALLER ONES THAT ISN'T THE DANGER EVERY THORN IS POISONED AND EVEN THE BLADES OF GRASS CARRY A DEADLY STING
3490-177641-0007 WATCH OUT FOR INSECTS OF ANY KIND AND ONCE WE START MOVING BREATHE ONLY THROUGH THE WET CLOTHS HE'S RIGHT NAXA SNORTED
3490-177641-0008 DEATH DEATH UP BY THAT WALL DO LIKE E SAYS THEY COULD ONLY WAIT THEN HONING DOWN ALREADY NEEDLE SHARP CROSSBOW BOLTS AND GLANCING UP AT THE SLOWLY MOVING SUN ONLY NAXA DIDN'T SHARE THE UNREST
3490-177641-0009 HE SAT EYES UNFOCUSED FEELING THE MOVEMENT OF ANIMAL LIFE IN THE JUNGLE AROUND THEM ON THE WAY HE SAID BIGGEST THING I VER HEARD NOT A BEAST TWEEN HERE AND THE MOUNTAINS AIN'T HOWLIN IS LUNGS OUT RUNNIN TOWARDS THE CITY JASON WAS AWARE OF PART OF IT
3490-177641-0010 THEY HIT NAXA SAID SUDDENLY THE MEN WERE ON THEIR FEET NOW STARING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CITY JASON HAD FELT THE TWIST AS THE ATTACK HAD BEEN DRIVEN HOME AND KNEW THAT THIS WAS IT THERE WAS THE SOUND OF SHOTS AND A HEAVY BOOMING FAR AWAY
3490-177641-0011 THIN STREAMERS OF SMOKE BEGAN TO BLOW ABOVE THE TREETOPS LET'S GET INTO POSITION RHES SAID AROUND THEM THE JUNGLE HOWLED WITH AN ECHO OF HATRED
3490-177641-0012 JASON GOT THE MEDIKIT TO HIM IN TIME BUT HE WAS SO SICK HE HAD TO TURN BACK THE OTHER THREE WERE BITTEN OR SCRATCHED AND TREATMENT CAME TOO LATE THEIR SWOLLEN TWISTED BODIES WERE LEFT BEHIND ON THE TRAIL
3490-177641-0013 IT WAS TURNED ON BUT ONLY A HISS OF ATMOSPHERIC STATIC CAME FROM THE SPEAKER WE COULD HAVE TIMED IT RHES SAID NO WE COULDN'T JASON TOLD HIM NOT ACCURATELY WE WANT TO HIT THAT WALL AT THE HEIGHT OF THE ATTACK WHEN OUR CHANCES ARE BEST
3490-177641-0014 THE SOUND FROM THE SPEAKER CHANGED A VOICE SPOKE A SHORT SENTENCE THEN CUT OFF BRING ME THREE BARRELS OF FLOUR LET'S GO RHES URGED AS HE STARTED FORWARD WAIT JASON SAID TAKING HIM BY THE ARM I'M TIMING THE FLAME THROWER IT'S DUE IN THERE
3490-177641-0015 A BLAST OF FIRE SPRAYED THE GROUND THEN TURNED OFF WE HAVE FOUR MINUTES TO THE NEXT ONE WE HIT THE LONG PERIOD THEY RAN STUMBLING IN THE SOFT ASHES TRIPPING OVER CHARRED BONES AND RUSTED METAL TWO MEN GRABBED JASON UNDER THE ARM AND HALF CARRIED HIM ACROSS THE GROUND
3490-177641-0016 IT HADN'T BEEN PLANNED THAT WAY BUT IT SAVED PRECIOUS SECONDS THEY DROPPED HIM AGAINST THE WALL AND HE FUMBLED OUT THE BOMBS HE HAD MADE THE CHARGES FROM KRANNON'S GUN TAKEN WHEN HE WAS KILLED HAD BEEN HOOKED TOGETHER WITH A FIRING CIRCUIT ALL THE MOVES HAD BEEN REHEARSED CAREFULLY AND THEY WENT SMOOTHLY NOW
3490-177641-0017 IF HE WAS WRONG THEY WERE ALL DEAD THE FIRST MEN HAD SLAPPED THEIR WADS OF STICKY CONGEALED SAP AGAINST THE WALL JASON PRESSED THE CHARGES INTO THEM AND THEY STUCK A ROUGHLY RECTANGULAR PATTERN AS HIGH AS A MAN
3490-177641-0018 WHILE HE DID THIS THE DETONATING WIRE WAS RUN OUT TO ITS LENGTH AND THE RAIDERS PRESSED BACK AGAINST THE BASE OF THE WALL JASON STUMBLED THROUGH THE ASHES TO THE DETONATOR FELL ON IT AND PRESSED THE SWITCH AT THE SAME TIME
3490-177641-0019 BEHIND HIM A THUNDERING BANG SHOOK THE WALL AND RED FLAME BURST OUT RHES WAS THE FIRST ONE THERE PULLING AT THE TWISTED AND SMOKING METAL WITH HIS GLOVED HANDS OTHERS GRABBED ON AND BENT THE JAGGED PIECES ASIDE
3490-177641-0020 THE HOLE WAS FILLED WITH SMOKE AND NOTHING WAS VISIBLE THROUGH IT JASON DIVED INTO THE OPENING ROLLED ON A HEAP OF RUBBLE AND SMACKED INTO SOMETHING SOLID WHEN HE BLINKED THE SMOKE FROM HIS EYES HE LOOKED AROUND HIM HE WAS INSIDE THE CITY
3490-177641-0021 THE OTHERS POURED THROUGH NOW PICKING HIM UP AS THEY CHARGED IN SO HE WOULDN'T BE TRAMPLED UNDERFOOT SOMEONE SPOTTED THE SPACESHIP AND THEY RAN THAT WAY A MAN RAN AROUND THE CORNER OF A BUILDING TOWARDS THEM
3490-177641-0022 THE MAN SLUMPED SLOWLY BACK ONTO THE STREET THREE METAL BOLTS STICKING OUT OF HIS BODY THEY RAN ON WITHOUT STOPPING RUNNING BETWEEN THE LOW STOREHOUSES THE SHIP STOOD AHEAD SOMEONE HAD REACHED IT AHEAD OF THEM THEY COULD SEE THE OUTER HATCH SLOWLY GRINDING SHUT
3490-177641-0023 A HAIL OF BOLTS FROM THE BOWS CRASHED INTO IT WITH NO EFFECT KEEP GOING JASON SHOUTED GET NEXT TO THE HULL BEFORE HE REACHES THE GUNS THIS TIME THREE MEN DIDN'T MAKE IT THE REST OF THEM WERE UNDER THE BELLY OF THE SHIP WHEN EVERY GUN LET GO AT ONCE
3490-177641-0024 WHOEVER WAS INSIDE THE SHIP HAD HIT ALL THE GUN TRIPS AT ONCE BOTH TO KNOCK OUT THE ATTACKERS AND SUMMON AID HE WOULD BE ON THE SCREEN NOW CALLING FOR HELP THEIR TIME WAS RUNNING OUT
3490-177641-0025 IT WAS LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE ONE OF THE MEN BRUSHED HIM ASIDE AND PULLED AT THE INSET HANDLE IT BROKE OFF IN HIS HAND BUT THE HATCH REMAINED CLOSED THE BIG GUNS HAD STOPPED NOW AND THEY COULD HEAR AGAIN DID ANYONE GET THE GUN FROM THAT DEAD MAN HE ASKED IT WOULD BLOW THIS THING OPEN
3490-177641-0026 NO RHES SAID WE DIDN'T STOP BEFORE THE WORDS WERE OUT OF HIS MOUTH TWO MEN WERE RUNNING BACK TOWARDS THE BUILDINGS ANGLING AWAY FROM EACH OTHER THE SHIP'S GUNS ROARED AGAIN A STRING OF EXPLOSIONS CUT ACROSS ONE MAN BEFORE THEY COULD CHANGE DIRECTION AND FIND THE OTHER MAN HE HAD REACHED THE BUILDINGS
3490-177641-0027 HE RETURNED QUICKLY DARTING INTO THE OPEN TO THROW THE GUN TO THEM BEFORE HE COULD DIVE BACK TO SAFETY THE SHELLS CAUGHT HIM JASON GRABBED UP THE GUN AS IT SKIDDED ALMOST TO HIS FEET THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF WIDE OPEN TRUCK TURBINES SCREAMING TOWARDS THEM AS HE BLASTED THE LOCK
3490-177641-0028 THE MECHANISM SIGHED AND THE HATCH SAGGED OPEN THEY WERE ALL THROUGH THE AIR LOCK BEFORE THE FIRST TRUCK APPEARED NAXA STAYED BEHIND WITH THE GUN TO HOLD THE LOCK UNTIL THEY COULD TAKE THE CONTROL ROOM EVERYONE CLIMBED FASTER THAN JASON ONCE HE HAD POINTED THEM THE WAY SO THE BATTLE WAS OVER WHEN HE GOT THERE
3490-177641-0029 ONE OF THE TECHS HAD FOUND THE GUN CONTROLS AND WAS SHOOTING WILDLY THE SHEER QUANTITY OF HIS FIRE DRIVING THE TRUCKS BACK
3490-177641-0030 HE FOUND THE COMMUNICATIONS SCREEN AND SNAPPED IT ON KERK'S WIDE EYED FACE STARED AT HIM FROM THE SCREEN YOU KERK SAID BREATHING THE WORD LIKE A CURSE YES IT'S ME JASON ANSWERED HE TALKED WITHOUT LOOKING UP WHILE HIS HANDS WERE BUSY AT THE CONTROL BOARD
3490-177641-0031 LISTEN TO ME KERK AND DON'T DOUBT ANYTHING I SAY I MAY NOT KNOW HOW TO FLY ONE OF THESE SHIPS BUT I DO KNOW HOW TO BLOW THEM UP DO YOU HEAR THAT SOUND HE FLIPPED OVER A SWITCH AND THE FARAWAY WHINE OF A PUMP DRONED FAINTLY THAT'S THE MAIN FUEL PUMP
3490-177641-0032 IF I LET IT RUN WHICH I WON'T RIGHT NOW IT COULD QUICKLY FILL THE DRIVE CHAMBER WITH RAW FUEL POUR IN SO MUCH THAT IT WOULD RUN OUT OF THE STERN TUBES THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN TO YOUR ONE AND ONLY SPACER IF I PRESSED THE FIRING BUTTON
3490-177641-0033 I'M NOT ASKING YOU WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME SINCE YOU DON'T CARE BUT YOU NEED THIS SHIP THE WAY YOU NEED LIFE ITSELF THERE WAS ONLY SILENCE IN THE CABIN NOW THE MEN WHO HAD WON THE SHIP TURNED TO FACE HIM KERK'S VOICE GRATED LOUDLY THROUGH THE ROOM
3490-177641-0034 WHY DID YOU LEAD THOSE ANIMALS IN HERE HIS VOICE CRACKED AND BROKE AS ANGER CHOKED HIM AND SPILLED OVER WATCH YOUR TONGUE KERK JASON SAID WITH SOFT MENACE
3490-177641-0035 IF YOU WANT THEM TO SHARE IT WITH YOU YOU HAD BETTER LEARN TO TALK NICELY
3490-177641-0036 JASON LOOKED AT THE OLDER MAN'S FLORID AND SWOLLEN FACE AND FELT A MEASURE OF SYMPATHY
