1571-138486-0000 THE TWO BILLS HAD A COMMON ORIGIN AND TO A GREAT EXTENT A COMMON OBJECT THEY WERE FRAMED AT THE SAME TIME AND LAID ASIDE AT THE SAME TIME THEY SANK TOGETHER INTO OBLIVION
1571-138486-0001 ADAPTED TO THE WANTS THE FEELINGS AND THE PREJUDICES OF THE EXISTING GENERATION ACCORDINGLY WHILE THE TOLERATION BILL FOUND SUPPORT IN ALL QUARTERS THE COMPREHENSION BILL WAS ATTACKED FROM ALL QUARTERS
1571-138486-0002 AND WAS AT LAST COLDLY AND LANGUIDLY DEFENDED EVEN BY THOSE WHO HAD INTRODUCED IT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AT WHICH THE TOLERATION BILL BECAME LAW WITH THE GENERAL CONCURRENCE OF PUBLIC MEN THE COMPREHENSION BILL WAS
1571-138486-0003 WITH A CONCURRENCE NOT LESS GENERAL SUFFERED TO DROP THE TOLERATION BILL STILL RANKS AMONG THOSE GREAT STATUTES WHICH ARE EPOCHS IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY THE COMPREHENSION BILL IS FORGOTTEN
1571-138486-0004 NO COLLECTOR OF ANTIQUITIES HAS THOUGHT IT WORTH PRESERVING A SINGLE COPY THE SAME WHICH NOTTINGHAM PRESENTED TO THE PEERS IS STILL AMONG OUR PARLIAMENTARY RECORDS BUT HAS BEEN SEEN BY ONLY TWO OR THREE PERSONS NOW LIVING
1571-138486-0005 IT IS A FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IN THIS COPY ALMOST THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE BILL CAN BE READ IN SPITE OF CANCELLATIONS AND INTERLINEATIONS
1571-138486-0006 DISPENSED ALL THE MINISTERS OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH FROM THE NECESSITY OF SUBSCRIBING THE THIRTY NINE ARTICLES FOR THE ARTICLES WAS SUBSTITUTED A DECLARATION WHICH RAN THUS
1571-138486-0007 I DO APPROVE OF THE DOCTRINE AND WORSHIP AND GOVERNMENT OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND BY LAW ESTABLISHED AS CONTAINING ALL THINGS NECESSARY TO SALVATION AND I PROMISE IN THE EXERCISE OF MY MINISTRY TO PREACH AND PRACTICE ACCORDING THEREUNTO
1571-138486-0008 ANOTHER CLAUSE GRANTED SIMILAR INDULGENCE TO THE MEMBERS OF THE TWO UNIVERSITIES THEN IT WAS PROVIDED THAT ANY MINISTER WHO HAD BEEN ORDAINED AFTER THE PRESBYTERIAN FASHION MIGHT WITHOUT REORDINATION
1571-138486-0009 AND ADMINISTER THE SACRAMENTS AND TO PERFORM ALL OTHER MINISTERIAL OFFICES IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND THE PERSON THUS ADMITTED WAS TO BE CAPABLE OF HOLDING ANY RECTORY OR VICARAGE IN THE KINGDOM
1571-138486-0010 THEN FOLLOWED CLAUSES PROVIDING THAT A CLERGYMAN MIGHT EXCEPT IN A FEW CHURCHES OF PECULIAR DIGNITY WEAR THE SURPLICE OR NOT AS HE THOUGHT FIT THAT THE SIGN OF THE CROSS MIGHT BE OMITTED IN BAPTISM THAT CHILDREN MIGHT BE CHRISTENED
1571-138486-0011 IF SUCH WERE THE WISH OF THEIR PARENTS WITHOUT GODFATHERS OR GODMOTHERS AND THAT PERSONS WHO HAD A SCRUPLE ABOUT RECEIVING THE EUCHARIST KNEELING MIGHT RECEIVE IT SITTING THE CONCLUDING CLAUSE WAS DRAWN IN THE FORM OF A PETITION
1571-138486-0012 AND TO RECOMMEND SUCH ALTERATIONS AS MIGHT ON INQUIRY APPEAR TO BE DESIRABLE THE BILL WENT SMOOTHLY THROUGH THE FIRST STAGES COMPTON WHO SINCE SANCROFT HAD SHUT HIMSELF UP AT LAMBETH WAS VIRTUALLY PRIMATE
1571-138486-0013 IT APPEARED THAT THERE WAS A STRONG BODY OF CHURCHMEN WHO WERE DETERMINED NOT TO GIVE UP A SINGLE WORD OR FORM TO WHOM IT SEEMED THAT THE PRAYERS WERE NO PRAYERS WITHOUT THE SURPLICE THE BABE NO CHRISTIAN IF NOT MARKED WITH THE CROSS
1571-138486-0014 THE BREAD AND WINE NO MEMORIALS OF REDEMPTION OR VEHICLES OF GRACE IF NOT RECEIVED ON BENDED KNEE WHY THESE PERSONS ASKED WAS THE DOCILE AND AFFECTIONATE SON OF THE CHURCH TO BE DISGUSTED BY SEEING THE IRREVERENT PRACTICES OF A CONVENTICLE
1571-138486-0015 INTRODUCED INTO HER MAJESTIC CHOIRS WHY SHOULD HIS FEELINGS HIS PREJUDICES IF PREJUDICES THEY WERE BE LESS CONSIDERED THAN THE WHIMS OF SCHISMATICS IF AS BURNET AND MEN LIKE BURNET WERE NEVER WEARY OF REPEATING
1571-138486-0016 INDULGENCE WAS DUE TO A WEAK BROTHER WAS IT LESS DUE TO THE BROTHER WHOSE WEAKNESS CONSISTED IN THE EXCESS OF HIS LOVE FOR AN ANCIENT A DECENT A BEAUTIFUL RITUAL ASSOCIATED IN HIS IMAGINATION FROM CHILDHOOD WITH ALL THAT IS MOST SUBLIME AND ENDEARING
1571-138486-0017 WAS NOT THAT SORT OF SCRUPULOSITY WHICH THE APOSTLE HAD COMMANDED BELIEVERS TO RESPECT IT SPRANG NOT FROM MORBID TENDERNESS OF CONSCIENCE BUT FROM CENSORIOUSNESS AND SPIRITUAL PRIDE
1571-138486-0018 AND NONE WHO HAD STUDIED THE NEW TESTAMENT COULD HAVE FAILED TO OBSERVE THAT WHILE WE ARE CHARGED CAREFULLY TO AVOID WHATEVER MAY GIVE SCANDAL TO THE FEEBLE WE ARE TAUGHT BY DIVINE PRECEPT AND EXAMPLE TO MAKE NO CONCESSION TO THE SUPERCILIOUS
1571-138486-0019 PAINTED GLASS MUSIC HOLIDAYS FAST DAYS WERE NOT OF THE ESSENCE OF RELIGION WERE THE WINDOWS OF KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL TO BE BROKEN AT THE DEMAND OF ONE SET OF FANATICS WAS THE ORGAN OF EXETER TO BE SILENCED TO PLEASE ANOTHER
1571-138486-0020 WAS CHRISTMAS NO LONGER TO BE A DAY OF REJOICING WAS PASSION WEEK NO LONGER TO BE A SEASON OF HUMILIATION THESE CHANGES IT IS TRUE WERE NOT YET PROPOSED PUT IF SO THE HIGH CHURCHMEN REASONED
1571-138486-0021 ALL THOSE THINGS WHICH THE PURITANS REGARD AS THE BLEMISHES OF THE CHURCH ARE BY A LARGE PART OF THE POPULATION RECKONED AMONG HER ATTRACTIONS MAY SHE NOT IN CEASING TO GIVE SCANDAL TO A FEW SOUR PRECISIANS
1571-138486-0022 CEASE ALSO TO INFLUENCE THE HEARTS OF MANY WHO NOW DELIGHT IN HER ORDINANCES IS IT NOT TO BE APPREHENDED THAT FOR EVERY PROSELYTE WHOM SHE ALLURES FROM THE MEETING HOUSE TEN OF HER OLD DISCIPLES MAY TURN AWAY FROM HER MAIMED RITES AND DISMANTLED TEMPLES
1571-138486-0023 AND THAT THESE NEW SEPARATISTS MAY EITHER FORM THEMSELVES INTO A SECT FAR MORE FORMIDABLE THAN THE SECT WHICH WE ARE NOW SEEKING TO CONCILIATE OR MAY IN THE VIOLENCE OF THEIR DISGUST AT A COLD AND IGNOBLE WORSHIP
1571-138486-0024 THE TRUTH IS THAT FROM THE TIME OF JAMES THE FIRST THAT GREAT PARTY WHICH HAS BEEN PECULIARLY ZEALOUS FOR THE ANGLICAN POLITY AND THE ANGLICAN RITUAL HAS ALWAYS LEANED STRONGLY TOWARDS ARMINIANISM
1571-138486-0025 HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THAT HER DELIBERATE JUDGMENT ON SUCH POINTS IS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE FOUND IN AN ARTICLE OR A HOMILY THAN IN AN EJACULATION OF PENITENCE OR A HYMN OF THANKSGIVING IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT IN THE DEBATES ON THE COMPREHENSION BILL
1571-138486-0026 A SINGLE HIGH CHURCHMAN RAISED HIS VOICE AGAINST THE CLAUSE WHICH RELIEVED THE CLERGY FROM THE NECESSITY OF SUBSCRIBING THE ARTICLES AND OF DECLARING THE DOCTRINE CONTAINED IN THE HOMILIES TO BE SOUND NAY THE DECLARATION WHICH IN THE ORIGINAL DRAUGHT
1571-138486-0027 HAD THE BILL BECOME LAW THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE KINGDOM WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER THE NECESSITY OF SIGNING THE ARTICLES
1571-138486-0028 PRESENTS A STRIKING CONTRAST TO THE SPIRIT WITH WHICH THEY STRUGGLED FOR HER POLITY AND HER RITUAL THE CLAUSE WHICH ADMITTED PRESBYTERIAN MINISTERS TO HOLD BENEFICES WITHOUT EPISCOPAL ORDINATION WAS REJECTED
1571-138486-0029 THE MAJORITY OF PEERS IN THE HOUSE WAS AGAINST THE PROPOSED INDULGENCE AND THE SCALE WAS BUT JUST TURNED BY THE PROXIES BUT BY THIS TIME IT BEGAN TO APPEAR THAT THE BILL WHICH THE HIGH CHURCHMEN WERE SO KEENLY ASSAILING
1571-138486-0030 THE TRUTH IS THAT THE TIME FOR SUCH A SCHEME HAD GONE BY IF A HUNDRED YEARS EARLIER WHEN THE DIVISION IN THE PROTESTANT BODY WAS RECENT
1571-138486-0031 ELIZABETH HAD BEEN SO WISE AS TO ABSTAIN FROM REQUIRING THE OBSERVANCE OF A FEW FORMS WHICH A LARGE PART OF HER SUBJECTS CONSIDERED AS POPISH SHE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE AVERTED THOSE FEARFUL CALAMITIES WHICH FORTY YEARS AFTER HER DEATH AFFLICTED THE CHURCH
1571-138486-0032 BUT THE GENERAL TENDENCY OF SCHISM IS TO WIDEN HAD LEO THE TENTH WHEN THE EXACTIONS AND IMPOSTURES OF THE PARDONERS FIRST ROUSED THE INDIGNATION OF SAXONY CORRECTED THOSE EVIL PRACTICES WITH A VIGOROUS HAND
1571-138486-0033 THE ORIGINAL SUBJECT OF QUARREL WAS ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE INQUIRING SPIRIT WHICH HAD BEEN ROUSED BY A SINGLE ABUSE HAD DISCOVERED OR IMAGINED A THOUSAND CONTROVERSIES ENGENDERED CONTROVERSIES
1571-138486-0034 EVERY ATTEMPT THAT WAS MADE TO ACCOMMODATE ONE DISPUTE ENDED BY PRODUCING ANOTHER AND AT LENGTH A GENERAL COUNCIL WHICH DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF THE DISTEMPER HAD BEEN SUPPOSED TO BE AN INFALLIBLE REMEDY MADE THE CASE UTTERLY HOPELESS
1571-138486-0035 IN THIS RESPECT AS IN MANY OTHERS THE HISTORY OF PURITANISM IN ENGLAND BEARS A CLOSE ANALOGY TO THE HISTORY OF PROTESTANTISM IN EUROPE THE PARLIAMENT OF SIXTEEN EIGHTY NINE COULD NO MORE PUT AN END TO NONCONFORMITY BY TOLERATING A GARB OR A POSTURE
1571-138486-0036 THAN THE DOCTORS OF TRENT COULD HAVE RECONCILED THE TEUTONIC NATIONS TO THE PAPACY BY REGULATING THE SALE OF INDULGENCES IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY QUAKERISM WAS UNKNOWN AND THERE WAS NOT IN THE WHOLE REALM A SINGLE CONGREGATION OF INDEPENDENTS OR BAPTISTS
1571-138486-0037 AT THE TIME OF THE REVOLUTION THE INDEPENDENTS BAPTISTS AND QUAKERS WERE A MAJORITY OF THE DISSENTING BODY AND THESE SECTS COULD NOT BE GAINED OVER ON ANY TERMS WHICH THE LOWEST OF LOW CHURCHMEN WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO OFFER
1571-138486-0038 THE INDEPENDENT HELD THAT A NATIONAL CHURCH GOVERNED BY ANY CENTRAL AUTHORITY WHATEVER POPE PATRIARCH KING BISHOP OR SYNOD WAS AN UNSCRIPTURAL INSTITUTION AND THAT EVERY CONGREGATION OF BELIEVERS WAS UNDER CHRIST
1571-138486-0039 WOULD NOT NOW SATISFY EVEN ONE HALF OF THE NONCONFORMISTS AND IT WAS THE OBVIOUS INTEREST OF EVERY NONCONFORMIST WHOM NO CONCESSION WOULD SATISFY THAT NONE OF HIS BRETHREN SHOULD BE SATISFIED THE MORE LIBERAL THE TERMS OF COMPREHENSION
1571-138486-0040 THE GREATER WAS THE ALARM OF EVERY SEPARATIST WHO KNEW THAT HE COULD IN NO CASE BE COMPREHENDED THERE WAS BUT SLENDER HOPE THAT THE DISSENTERS UNBROKEN AND ACTING AS ONE MAN WOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FROM THE LEGISLATURE
1571-138486-0041 FULL ADMISSION TO CIVIL PRIVILEGES AND ALL HOPE OF OBTAINING SUCH ADMISSION MUST BE RELINQUISHED IF NOTTINGHAM SHOULD BY THE HELP OF SOME WELLMEANING BUT SHORTSIGHTED FRIENDS OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY BE ENABLED TO ACCOMPLISH HIS DESIGN IF HIS BILL PASSED
1571-138486-0042 AND THE CHURCH STRENGTHENED BY A LARGE REINFORCEMENT IT WAS PLAIN THAT ALL CHANCE OF OBTAINING ANY RELAXATION OF THE TEST ACT WOULD BE AT AN END AND IT WAS BUT TOO PROBABLE THAT THE TOLERATION ACT MIGHT NOT LONG REMAIN UNREPEALED
1571-138486-0043 SINCE THE DECLARATION OF INDULGENCE HAD APPEARED BEEN VERY AGREEABLY SETTLED IN THE CAPITAL AND IN OTHER LARGE TOWNS AND WERE NOW ABOUT TO ENJOY UNDER THE SURE GUARANTEE OF AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT THAT TOLERATION WHICH
1571-138486-0044 UNDER THE DECLARATION OF INDULGENCE HAD BEEN ILLICIT AND PRECARIOUS THE SITUATION OF THESE MEN WAS SUCH AS THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE DIVINES OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH MIGHT WELL ENVY FEW INDEED OF THE PAROCHIAL CLERGY WERE SO ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED WITH COMFORTS
1571-138486-0045 AS THE FAVOURITE ORATOR OF A GREAT ASSEMBLY OF NONCONFORMISTS IN THE CITY THE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS OF HIS WEALTHY HEARERS ALDERMEN AND DEPUTIES WEST INDIA MERCHANTS AND TURKEY MERCHANTS
1571-138486-0046 WARDENS OF THE COMPANY OF FISHMONGERS AND WARDENS OF THE COMPANY OF GOLDSMITHS ENABLED HIM TO BECOME A LANDOWNER OR A MORTGAGEE THE BEST BROADCLOTH FROM BLACKWELL HALL AND THE BEST POULTRY FROM LEADENHALL MARKET WERE FREQUENTLY LEFT AT HIS DOOR
1571-138486-0047 HIS INFLUENCE OVER HIS FLOCK WAS IMMENSE SCARCELY ANY MEMBER OF A CONGREGATION OF SEPARATISTS ENTERED INTO A PARTNERSHIP MARRIED A DAUGHTER PUT A SON OUT AS APPRENTICE OR GAVE HIS VOTE AT AN ELECTION WITHOUT CONSULTING HIS SPIRITUAL GUIDE
1571-138486-0048 ON ALL POLITICAL AND LITERARY QUESTIONS THE MINISTER WAS THE ORACLE OF HIS OWN CIRCLE IT WAS POPULARLY REMARKED DURING MANY YEARS THAT AN EMINENT DISSENTING MINISTER HAD ONLY TO MAKE HIS SON AN ATTORNEY OR A PHYSICIAN
1571-138486-0049 THAT THE ATTORNEY WAS SURE TO HAVE CLIENTS AND THE PHYSICIAN TO HAVE PATIENTS WHILE A WAITING WOMAN WAS GENERALLY CONSIDERED AS A HELP MEET FOR A CHAPLAIN IN HOLY ORDERS OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH THE WIDOWS AND DAUGHTERS OF OPULENT CITIZENS WERE SUPPOSED TO BELONG IN A PECULIAR MANNER
1571-138486-0050 TO NONCONFORMIST PASTORS ONE OF THE GREAT PRESBYTERIAN RABBIES THEREFORE MIGHT WELL DOUBT WHETHER IN A WORLDLY VIEW HE SHOULD BE BENEFITED BY A COMPREHENSION HE MIGHT INDEED HOLD A RECTORY OR A VICARAGE WHEN HE COULD GET ONE
1571-138486-0051 BUT IN THE MEANTIME HE WOULD BE DESTITUTE HIS MEETING HOUSE WOULD BE CLOSED HIS CONGREGATION WOULD BE DISPERSED AMONG THE PARISH CHURCHES IF A BENEFICE WERE BESTOWED ON HIM IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A VERY SLENDER COMPENSATION FOR THE INCOME WHICH HE HAD LOST
1571-138486-0052 ONE SECTION OF THAT PARTY WAS FOR RELIEVING THE DISSENTERS FROM THE TEST ACT AND GIVING UP THE COMPREHENSION BILL ANOTHER SECTION WAS FOR PUSHING FORWARD THE COMPREHENSION BILL AND POSTPONING TO A MORE CONVENIENT TIME THE CONSIDERATION OF THE TEST ACT
1571-138486-0053 THE EFFECT OF THIS DIVISION AMONG THE FRIENDS OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY WAS THAT THE HIGH CHURCHMEN THOUGH A MINORITY IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND NOT A MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS WERE ABLE TO OPPOSE WITH SUCCESS BOTH THE REFORMS WHICH THEY DREADED
