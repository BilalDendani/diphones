5826-53496-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT
5826-53496-0001 MOST PROBABLY HE WOULD FIND HIMSELF IN THE PRESENCE OF MISSUS DALE AND HER DAUGHTER AND OF GRACE ALSO AT HIS FIRST ENTRANCE AND IF SO HIS POSITION WOULD BE AWKWARD ENOUGH
5826-53496-0002 HE ALMOST REGRETTED NOW THAT HE HAD NOT WRITTEN TO MISSUS DALE AND ASKED FOR AN INTERVIEW HIS TASK WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT IF HE SHOULD FIND ALL THE LADIES TOGETHER
5826-53496-0003 AS HE HAD ALREADY LEARNED THAT MISSUS DALE'S RESIDENCE WAS CALLED BY ALL THE NEIGHBOURHOOD NOBODY WAS AT HOME THE SERVANT SAID AND THEN WHEN THE VISITOR BEGAN TO MAKE FURTHER INQUIRY THE GIRL EXPLAINED THAT THE TWO YOUNG LADIES HAD WALKED AS FAR
5826-53496-0004 AND THAT MISSUS DALE WAS AT THIS MOMENT AT THE GREAT HOUSE WITH THE SQUIRE
5826-53496-0005 THE MAID HOWEVER WAS INTERRUPTED BEFORE SHE HAD FINISHED TELLING ALL THIS TO THE MAJOR BY FINDING HER MISTRESS BEHIND HER IN THE PASSAGE
5826-53496-0006 THEN THE MAJOR ANNOUNCED HIMSELF MY NAME IS MAJOR GRANTLY SAID HE AND HE WAS BLUNDERING ON WITH SOME WORDS ABOUT HIS OWN INTRUSION WHEN MISSUS DALE BEGGED HIM TO FOLLOW HER INTO THE DRAWING ROOM HE HAD MUTTERED SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT MISSUS DALE WOULD NOT KNOW WHO HE WAS
5826-53496-0007 BUT MISSUS DALE KNEW ALL ABOUT HIM AND HAD HEARD THE WHOLE OF GRACE'S STORY FROM LILY SHE AND LILY HAD OFTEN DISCUSSED THE QUESTION WHETHER UNDER EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES
5826-53496-0008 AND THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER HAD DIFFERED SOMEWHAT ON THE MATTER
5826-53496-0009 WAS SO CALAMITOUS TO ALL CONNECTED WITH HIM AS TO JUSTIFY ANY MAN NOT ABSOLUTELY ENGAGED IN ABANDONING THE THOUGHTS OF SUCH A MARRIAGE
5826-53496-0010 AND HAD DECLARED HER OPINION THAT THEY WERE ENTITLED TO CONSIDERATION BUT LILY HAD OPPOSED THIS IDEA VERY STOUTLY ASSERTING THAT IN AN AFFAIR OF LOVE A MAN SHOULD THINK NEITHER OF FATHER OR BROTHER OR MOTHER OR SISTER
5826-53496-0011 IF HE IS WORTH ANYTHING LILY HAD SAID HE WILL COME TO HER NOW NOW IN HER TROUBLE
5826-53496-0012 IN ANSWER TO THIS MISSUS DALE HAD REPLIED THAT WOMEN HAD NO RIGHT TO EXPECT FROM MEN SUCH SELF DENYING NOBILITY AS THAT I DON'T EXPECT IT MAMMA SAID LILY AND I AM SURE THAT GRACE DOES NOT INDEED I AM QUITE SURE THAT GRACE DOES NOT EXPECT EVEN TO SEE HIM EVER AGAIN
5826-53496-0013 SHE NEVER SAYS SO BUT I KNOW THAT SHE HAS MADE UP HER MIND ABOUT IT STILL I THINK HE OUGHT TO COME IT CAN HARDLY BE THAT A MAN IS BOUND TO DO A THING THE DOING OF WHICH AS YOU CONFESS WOULD BE ALMOST MORE THAN NOBLE SAID MISSUS DALE
5826-53496-0014 AND SO THE MATTER HAD BEEN DISCUSSED BETWEEN THEM BUT NOW AS IT SEEMED TO MISSUS DALE THE MAN HAD COME TO DO THIS NOBLE THING AT ANY RATE HE WAS THERE IN HER DRAWING ROOM
5826-53496-0015 YOU MAY NOT PROBABLY HAVE HEARD MY NAME HE SAID BUT I AM ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR FRIEND MISS CRAWLEY I KNOW YOUR NAME VERY WELL MAJOR GRANTLY MY BROTHER IN LAW WHO LIVES OVER YONDER MISTER DALE KNOWS YOUR FATHER VERY WELL
5826-53496-0016 IS HE AT HOME NOW MISTER DALE IS ALMOST ALWAYS AT HOME
5826-53496-0017 THEY HAD MANAGED TO SEAT THEMSELVES AND MISSUS DALE HAD SAID ENOUGH TO PUT HER VISITOR FAIRLY AT HIS EASE IF HE HAD ANYTHING SPECIAL TO SAY TO HER HE MUST SAY IT
5826-53496-0018 BUT THEY WILL CERTAINLY BE HOME BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR IF THAT IS NOT TOO LONG FOR YOU TO REMAIN AT ALLINGTON
5826-53496-0019 IT CERTAINLY WILL NOT HURT ME MAJOR GRANTLY PERHAPS YOU WILL LUNCH WITH ME I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MISSUS DALE IF YOU'LL PERMIT ME
5826-53496-0020 INDEED I HAVE INTENDED TO DO SO ALL THROUGH AND I CAN ONLY ASK YOU TO KEEP MY SECRET IF AFTER ALL IT SHOULD REQUIRE TO BE KEPT I WILL CERTAINLY KEEP ANY SECRET THAT YOU MAY ASK ME TO KEEP SAID MISSUS DALE TAKING OFF HER BONNET
5826-53496-0021 I HOPE THERE MAY BE NO NEED OF ONE SAID MAJOR GRANTLY THE TRUTH IS MISSUS DALE THAT I HAVE KNOWN MISS CRAWLEY FOR SOME TIME NEARLY FOR TWO YEARS NOW AND I MAY AS WELL SPEAK IT OUT AT ONCE
5826-53496-0022 THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF IT I KNOW THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT THEY ARE IN GREAT TROUBLE MISSUS DALE WAS GOING ON BUT SHE WAS INTERRUPTED BY MAJOR GRANTLY
5826-53496-0023 AND I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO SPEAK TO HIM OR HOW NOT TO SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT THIS UNFORTUNATE AFFAIR BUT MISSUS DALE YOU WILL I THINK PERCEIVE THAT THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE IT IMPERATIVE UPON ME TO BE EXPLICIT TO MISS CRAWLEY
5826-53496-0024 I THINK I AM THE LAST MAN TO BOAST OF A WOMAN'S REGARD BUT I HAD LEARNED TO THINK THAT I WAS NOT INDIFFERENT TO GRACE IF THAT BE SO WHAT MUST SHE THINK OF ME IF I STAY AWAY FROM HER NOW
5826-53496-0025 I MAY PERHAPS BE ABLE TO BRING COMFORT TO HER IN HER TROUBLE AS REGARDS MY WORLDLY POSITION THOUGH INDEED IT WILL NOT BE VERY GOOD AS HERS IS NOT GOOD EITHER YOU WILL NOT THINK YOURSELF BOUND TO FORBID ME TO SEE HER ON THAT HEAD
5826-53496-0026 CERTAINLY NOT I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT I FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT AS REGARDS MONEY YOU ARE OFFERING EVERYTHING WHERE YOU CAN GET NOTHING AND YOU UNDERSTAND MY FEELING INDEED I DO AND APPRECIATE THE GREAT NOBILITY OF YOUR LOVE FOR GRACE
5826-53496-0027 YOU SHALL SEE HER HERE IF YOU WISH IT AND TO DAY IF YOU CHOOSE TO WAIT MAJOR GRANTLY SAID THAT HE WOULD WAIT AND WOULD SEE GRACE ON THAT AFTERNOON MISSUS DALE AGAIN SUGGESTED THAT HE SHOULD LUNCH WITH HER BUT THIS HE DECLINED
5826-53496-0028 ON HER OWN CHILD HERE WAS A MAN WHO WAS AT ALL POINTS A GENTLEMAN
5826-53496-0029 AND BE LOVED BY HIM AND THE RESULT OF THAT CHANCE WOULD BE THAT GRACE WOULD HAVE EVERYTHING GIVEN TO HER THAT THE WORLD HAS TO GIVE WORTH ACCEPTANCE SHE WOULD HAVE A COMPANION FOR HER LIFE WHOM SHE COULD TRUST ADMIRE LOVE AND OF WHOM SHE COULD BE INFINITELY PROUD
5826-53496-0030 OR FIVE THOUSAND OR WHAT SUM INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN THE TWO NOR DID SHE GIVE MUCH OF HER THOUGHTS AT THE MOMENT TO THAT SIDE OF THE SUBJECT SHE KNEW WITHOUT THINKING OF IT OR FANCIED THAT SHE KNEW THAT THERE WERE MEANS SUFFICIENT FOR COMFORTABLE LIVING
5826-53496-0031 IT WAS SOLELY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE MAN THAT WAS IN HER MIND AND THE SUFFICIENCY THAT WAS TO BE FOUND IN THEM FOR A WIFE'S HAPPINESS BUT HER DAUGHTER HER LILY HAD COME ACROSS A MAN WHO WAS A SCOUNDREL
5826-53496-0032 AND AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT MEETING ALL HER LIFE WAS MARRED COULD ANY CREDIT BE GIVEN TO GRACE FOR HER SUCCESS OR ANY BLAME ATTACHED TO LILY FOR HER FAILURE SURELY NOT THE LATTER
5826-53496-0033 THEN MANY BITTER THOUGHTS PASSED THROUGH MISSUS DALE'S MIND AND SHE ALMOST ENVIED GRACE CRAWLEY HER LOVER
5826-53496-0034 AN IDEA PROBABLY NEVER ABSOLUTELY UTTERED EVEN TO HERSELF BUT NOT THE LESS PRACTICALLY CONCEIVED THAT IT IS THE BUSINESS OF A WOMAN TO BE MARRIED
5826-53496-0035 AS HE HAD NO WISH TO ENCOUNTER GRACE AND HER FRIEND ON THEIR RETURN INTO THE VILLAGE SO HE CROSSED A LITTLE BROOK WHICH RUNS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL ON WHICH THE CHIEF STREET OF ALLINGTON IS BUILT
5826-53496-0036 NOT KNOWING THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE PLACE HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT BY TAKING THAT PATH HE WAS MAKING HIS WAY BACK TO THE SQUIRE'S HOUSE BUT IT WAS SO
5826-53496-0037 HE FOUND HIMSELF LEANING ACROSS A GATE AND LOOKING INTO A PADDOCK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF WHICH WAS THE HIGH WALL OF A GENTLEMAN'S GARDEN TO AVOID THIS HE WENT ON A LITTLE FURTHER AND FOUND HIMSELF ON A FARM ROAD
5826-53496-0038 BUT MAJOR GRANTLY HAD NOT PERCEIVED THAT THE HOUSE MUST OF NECESSITY BE ALLINGTON HOUSE HAVING BEEN AWARE THAT HE HAD PASSED THE ENTRANCE TO THE PLACE AS HE ENTERED THE VILLAGE ON THE OTHER SIDE I'M AFRAID I'M INTRUDING HE SAID LIFTING HIS HAT
5826-53496-0039 I CAME UP THE PATH YONDER NOT KNOWING THAT IT WOULD LEAD ME SO CLOSE TO A GENTLEMAN'S HOUSE THERE IS A RIGHT OF WAY THROUGH THE FIELDS ON TO THE GUESTWICK ROAD SAID THE SQUIRE AND THEREFORE YOU ARE NOT TRESPASSING IN ANY SENSE BUT WE ARE NOT PARTICULAR ABOUT SUCH THINGS DOWN HERE
5826-53496-0040 AND YOU WOULD BE VERY WELCOME IF THERE WERE NO RIGHT OF WAY IF YOU ARE A STRANGER PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE OUTSIDE OF THE OLD HOUSE PEOPLE THINK IT PICTURESQUE THEN MAJOR GRANTLY BECAME AWARE THAT THIS MUST BE THE SQUIRE
5826-53496-0041 AND HE WAS ANNOYED WITH HIMSELF FOR HIS OWN AWKWARDNESS IN HAVING THUS COME UPON THE HOUSE HE WOULD HAVE WISHED TO KEEP HIMSELF ALTOGETHER UNSEEN IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE
5826-53496-0042 TO WHOM NOW THAT HE HAD MET HIM
5826-53496-0043 INDEED THE HOUSE ALTOGETHER IS AS GRACEFUL AS IT CAN BE THOSE TREES ARE OLD TOO SAID THE SQUIRE POINTING TO TWO CEDARS WHICH STOOD AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE THEY SAY THEY ARE OLDER THAN THE HOUSE BUT I DON'T FEEL SURE OF IT
5826-53496-0044 THERE WAS A MANSION HERE BEFORE VERY NEARLY THOUGH NOT QUITE ON THE SAME SPOT YOUR OWN ANCESTORS WERE LIVING HERE BEFORE THAT I SUPPOSE SAID GRANTLY MEANING TO BE CIVIL WELL YES TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE IT I SUPPOSE
5826-53496-0045 BY FAR THE BEST THAT THERE IS BY THE BY WOULD YOU LIKE TO STEP IN AND TAKE A GLASS OF WINE I'M VERY MUCH OBLIGED SAID THE MAJOR BUT INDEED I'D RATHER NOT THEN HE FOLLOWED THE SQUIRE DOWN TO THE CHURCHYARD AND WAS SHOWN THE CHURCH AS WELL AS THE VIEW OF THE HOUSE
5826-53496-0046 AND THE VICARAGE AND A VIEW OVER TO ALLINGTON WOODS FROM THE VICARAGE GATE OF WHICH THE SQUIRE WAS VERY FOND AND IN THIS WAY HE WAS TAKEN BACK ON TO THE GUESTWICK SIDE OF THE VILLAGE AND EVEN DOWN ON TO THE ROAD BY WHICH HE HAD ENTERED IT WITHOUT IN THE LEAST KNOWING WHERE HE WAS
5826-53496-0047 THIS IS ALLINGTON SAID THE SQUIRE AND AS HE SPOKE LILY DALE AND GRACE CRAWLEY TURNED A CORNER FROM THE GUESTWICK ROAD AND CAME CLOSE UPON THEM WELL GIRLS I DID NOT EXPECT TO SEE YOU SAID THE SQUIRE YOUR MAMMA TOLD ME YOU WOULDN'T BE BACK TILL IT WAS NEARLY DARK LILY
5826-53496-0048 BUT THE READER WILL BE AWARE THAT NO INTRODUCTION WAS POSSIBLE IT NEVER OCCURRED TO LILY THAT THIS MAN COULD BE THE MAJOR GRANTLY OF WHOM SHE AND GRACE HAD BEEN TALKING DURING THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE WALK HOME BUT GRACE AND HER LOVER HAD OF COURSE KNOWN EACH OTHER AT ONCE
5826-53496-0049 AND GRANTLY THOUGH HE WAS ABASHED AND ALMOST DISMAYED BY THE MEETING OF COURSE CAME FORWARD AND GAVE HIS HAND TO HIS FRIEND GRACE IN TAKING IT DID NOT UTTER A WORD
5826-53496-0050 THE SQUIRE INVITED HIM VERY WARMLY TO SEND HIS PORTMANTEAU UP TO THE HOUSE WE'LL HAVE THE LADIES UP FROM THE HOUSE BELOW AND MAKE IT AS LITTLE DULL FOR YOU AS POSSIBLE BUT THIS WOULD NOT HAVE SUITED GRANTLY
5826-53496-0051 AT ANY RATE WOULD NOT SUIT HIM TILL HE SHOULD KNOW WHAT ANSWER HE WAS TO HAVE HE EXCUSED HIMSELF THEREFORE PLEADING A POSITIVE NECESSITY TO BE AT GUESTWICK THAT EVENING AND THEN EXPLAINING THAT HE HAD ALREADY SEEN MISSUS DALE
5826-53496-0052 HE EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF GOING BACK TO THE SMALL HOUSE IN COMPANY WITH THE LADIES IF THEY WOULD ALLOW HIM THE SQUIRE WHO DID NOT AS YET QUITE UNDERSTAND IT ALL BADE HIM A FORMAL ADIEU
