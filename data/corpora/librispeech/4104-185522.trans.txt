4104-185522-0000 HARD FISTED FARMER LASS WHOSE TOILS IN THE FIELD FOR HER FATHER WAS IN BUT VERY MODERATE CIRCUMSTANCES HAD TAWNED HER COMPLEXION AND HARDENED HER MUSCLES AT AN EARLY AGE
4104-185522-0001 AS SHE GREW TOWARD WOMAN'S ESTATE NECESSITY COMPELLED HER TO LEAVE HER HOME AND SEEK SERVICE IN THE CITY OF EXETER WHERE FOR MANY YEARS SHE PLODDED ON VERY QUIETLY IN HER OBSCURE PATH
4104-185522-0002 FIRST AS A DOMESTIC HIRELING AND SUBSEQUENTLY AS A WASHER WOMAN I HAVE AN OLD AND ESTEEMED FRIEND ON STATEN ISLAND WHOSE FATHER STILL LIVING
4104-185522-0003 RECOLLECTS JOANNA WELL AS SHE USED TO COME REGULARLY TO HIS HOUSE OF A MONDAY MORNING TO HER TASK OF CLEANSING THE FAMILY LINEN HE WAS THEN BUT A LITTLE LAD YET HE REMEMBERS HER QUITE WELL WITH HER STOUT ROBUST FRAME
4104-185522-0004 AND BUXOM AND RATHER ATTRACTIVE COUNTENANCE AND HER QUEER WAYS EVEN THEN SHE WAS BEGINNING TO INVITE ATTENTION BY HER SINGULAR MANNERS AND DISCOURSE WHICH LED MANY TO BELIEVE HER DEMENTED
4104-185522-0005 IT WAS AT EXETER THAT JOANNA BECAME RELIGIOUSLY IMPRESSED AND JOINED THE WESLEYAN METHODISTS AS A STRICT AND EXTREME BELIEVER IN THE DOCTRINES OF THAT SECT DURING HER ATTENDANCE UPON THE WESLEYAN RITES
4104-185522-0006 SHE BECAME INTIMATE WITH ONE SANDERSON WHO
4104-185522-0007 PRETENDED THAT HE HAD DISCOVERED IN THE GOOD WASHERWOMAN A BIBLE PRODIGY
4104-185522-0008 FOR WHICH SANDERSON ALWAYS HAD READY SOME VERY TELLING INTERPRETATION
4104-185522-0009 SOMETIMES TRANSPORTING HER TO THE COURTS OF HEAVEN AND SOMETIMES TO A VERY OPPOSITE REGION CELEBRATED FOR ITS LATENT AND ACTIVE CALORIC WHEN SHE RANGED INTO THE LOWER WORLD
4104-185522-0010 SHE HAD A VERY UNPLEASANT HABIT OF SEEING SUNDRY SCOFFERS AND UNBELIEVERS IN HERSELF BELONGING TO THE CONGREGATION IN VERY CLOSE BUT DISADVANTAGEOUS INTERCOURSE WITH THE EVIL ONE
4104-185522-0011 WHO WAS REPRESENTED AS HAVING A PARTICULAR EYE TO OTHERS AROUND HER EVEN WHILE THEY LAID CLAIM TO SPECIAL PIETY OF COURSE SUCH REVELATIONS AS THESE COULD NOT BE TOLERATED IN ANY WELL REGULATED COMMUNITY
4104-185522-0012 AND WHEN SOME MOST ASTOUNDING RELIGIOUS GYMNASTICS PERFORMED BY JOANNA IN THE MIDST OF PRAYERS AND SERMONS OCCURRED TO HEAP UP THE MEASURE OF HER OFFENCES IT BECAME FULL TIME TO TAKE THE MATTER IN HAND
4104-185522-0013 AND THE PROPHETESS WAS EXPELLED NOW THOSE WHOM SHE HAD NOT SERVED UP OPENLY WITH BRIMSTONE AGREEING WITH HER ABOUT THOSE WHOM SHE HAD THUS
4104-185522-0014 SECEDED IN CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS AND BECAME JOANNA'S FOLLOWERS THIS GAVE HER A NUCLEUS TO WORK UPON AND BETWEEN SEVENTEEN NINETY AND EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SHE MANAGED TO MAKE HERSELF KNOWN THROUGHOUT BRITAIN
4104-185522-0015 PROCLAIMING THAT SHE WAS TO BE THE DESTINED MOTHER OF THE SECOND MESSIAH AND ALTHOUGH ORIGINALLY QUITE ILLITERATE PICKING UP ENOUGH GENERAL INFORMATION AND BIBLE LORE
4104-185522-0016 THOUGH SOMETIMES INCOHERENT WORKS ONE OF THE EARLIEST AND MOST STARTLING OF THESE WAS HER
4104-185522-0017 FROM THE SEALED PROPHECIES OF JOANNA SOUTHCOTT
4104-185522-0018 IN EIGHTEEN O FIVE A SHOEMAKER NAMED TOZER BUILT HER A CHAPEL IN EXETER AT HIS OWN EXPENSE AND IT WAS FROM THE FIRST CONSTANTLY FILLED ON SERVICE DAYS WITH EAGER WORSHIPERS
4104-185522-0019 HERE SHE GAVE EXHORTATIONS AND PROPHESIED IN A SPECIES OF RELIGIOUS FRENZY OR CONVULSION SOMETIMES UTTERING VERY HEAVY PROSE AND SOMETIMES THE MOST FEARFUL DOGGEREL RHYME RESEMBLING WELL
4104-185522-0020 PERHAPS OUR ALBUM EFFUSIONS HERE AT HOME INDEED I CAN THINK OF NOTHING ELSE EQUALLY FEARFUL
4104-185522-0021 AND TO JUST ABOUT THE SAME PURPOSE YET IT WAS ASTONISHING TO SEE HOW THE THING WENT DOWN CROWDS OF INTELLIGENT PEOPLE CAME FROM ALL PARTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM TO LISTEN BE CONVERTED
4104-185522-0022 THAT SECURED THEIR FORTUNATE POSSESSOR UNIMPEDED AND IMMEDIATE ADMISSION TO HEAVEN OF COURSE TICKETS SO PRECIOUS COULD NOT BE GIVEN AWAY FOR NOTHING AND THE SEAL TRADE IN THIS NEW FORM PROVED VERY LUCRATIVE
4104-185522-0023 THE MOST REMARKABLE OF ALL THESE CONVERSIONS WAS THAT OF THE CELEBRATED ENGRAVER WILLIAM SHARP WHO NOTWITHSTANDING HIS EMINENT POSITION AS AN ARTIST BY NO MEANS BORE OUT HIS NAME IN OTHER THINGS
4104-185522-0024 HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BECOME THOROUGHLY IMBUED WITH THE NOTIONS OF SWEDENBORG MESMER AND THE FAMOUS RICHARD BROTHERS AND WAS QUITE RIPE FOR ANYTHING FANTASTIC SUCH A CONVERT WAS A PERFECT GODSEND TO JOANNA
4104-185522-0025 AND SHE WAS EASILY PERSUADED TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO LONDON WHERE HER CONGREGATIONS RAPIDLY INCREASED TO ENORMOUS PROPORTIONS
4104-185522-0026 THE WHOLE SECT EXTENDED UNTIL IN EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN IT NUMBERED NO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS SIGNED AND SEALED MISTER SHARP OCCUPYING A MOST CONSPICUOUS POSITION
4104-185522-0027 AT THE VERY FOOTSTOOL OF THE PROPHETESS LATE IN EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN APPEARED THE BOOK OF WONDERS IN FIVE PARTS AND IT WAS A CLINCHER POOR SHARP CAME IN LARGELY FOR THE EXPENSES
4104-185522-0028 BUT VALIANTLY STOOD HIS GROUND AGAINST IT ALL AT LENGTH IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN THE GREAT JOANNA DAZZLED THE EYES OF HER ADHERENTS AND THE WORLD AT LARGE WITH HER
4104-185522-0029 THIS DELECTABLE MANIFESTO FLATLY ANNOUNCED TO MANKIND THAT THE SECOND SHILOH SO LONG EXPECTED WOULD BE BORN OF THE PROPHETESS AT MIDNIGHT ON OCTOBER NINETEENTH IN THAT SAME YEAR
4104-185522-0030 AS SHE EXPRESSLY AND SOLEMNLY DECLARED AND IN THE SIXTY FOURTH YEAR OF HER AGE AMONG THE OTHER PRETERNATURAL CONCOMITANTS OF THIS ANTICIPATED EVENTFUL BIRTH
4104-185522-0031 WAS THE FACT THAT THE PERIOD OF HER PREGNANCY HAD LASTED FOR SEVERAL YEARS OF COURSE THIS STUPENDOUS ANNOUNCEMENT THREW THE WHOLE SECT INTO ECSTASIES OF RELIGIOUS EXULTATION
4104-185522-0032 WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND IT AFFORDED A FRUITFUL SUBJECT OF RIDICULE FOR THE UTTERLY IRREVERENT LONDON PAMPHLETEERS POOR SHARP
4104-185522-0033 WHO HAD CAUSED A MAGNIFICENT CRADLE AND BABY WARDROBE TO BE GOT READY AT HIS OWN EXPENSE WAS MOST UNMERCIFULLY SCORED THE INFANT WAS CARICATURED WITH A LONG GRAY BEARD AND SPECTACLES
4104-185522-0034 WITH SHARP IN A DUSTER CAREFULLY ROCKING HIM TO SLEEP WHILE JOANNA THE PROPHETESS TREATED THE ENGRAVER TO SOME CUTS IN HER OWN STYLE WITH A BUNCH OF TWIGS
4104-185522-0035 ON THE APPOINTED NIGHT THE STREET IN WHICH JOANNA LIVED WAS THRONGED WITH THE FAITHFUL WHO UNDETERRED BY SARCASM FULLY CREDITED HER PREDICTION
4104-185522-0036 AND AS THE HOURS WORE ON AND THEIR INTEREST INCREASED BURST FORTH INTO SPONTANEOUS PSALMODY THE ADJACENT THOROUGHFARES WERE AS DENSELY JAMMED WITH CURIOUS AND INCREDULOUS SPECTATORS
4104-185522-0037 AND THE MUTTON PIE AND BALLAD BUSINESSES FLOURISHED EXTENSIVELY THE INTERIOR OF THE HOUSE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SICK CHAMBER WAS ILLUMINATED IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND THE DIGNITARIES OF THE SECT HELD THE ANTE ROOMS AND CORRIDORS
4104-185522-0038 TO RECEIVE THE EXPECTED GUEST BUT THE EVENING PASSED
4104-185522-0039 THEN MORNING BUT ALAS NO SHILOH AND LITTLE BY LITTLE THE DISAPPOINTED THRONGS DISPERSED POOR JOANNA HOWEVER KEPT HER BED AND FINALLY AFTER MANY FRESH PAROXYSMS AND PROPHECIES
4104-185522-0040 ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF DECEMBER EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN GAVE UP THE GHOST THE INDEFATIGABLE SHARP STILL DECLARING THAT SHE HAD GONE TO HEAVEN FOR A SEASON
4104-185522-0041 AFTER FOUR DAYS WITH THE SHILOH IN HER ARMS SO FIRM WAS THIS FAITH IN HIM AND MANY OTHER RESPECTABLE PERSONS THAT THE BODY OF THE PROPHETESS WAS RETAINED IN HER HOUSE UNTIL THE VERY LAST MOMENT
4104-185522-0042 WHEN THE DISSECTION DEMANDED BY THE MAJORITY OF THE SECT COULD NO LONGER BE DELAYED THAT OPERATION WAS PERFORMED AND IT WAS FOUND THAT THE SUBJECT HAD DIED OF OVARIAN DROPSY BUT WAS
4104-185522-0043 AS SHE HAD ALWAYS MAINTAINED HERSELF TO BE A VIRGIN DOCTOR REECE WHO HAD BEEN A DEVOUT BELIEVER BUT WAS NOW UNDECEIVED PUBLISHED A FULL ACCOUNT OF THIS AND ALL THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER DEATH
4104-185522-0044 AND ANOTHER EQUALLY EARNEST DISCIPLE BORE THE EXPENSES OF HER BURIAL AT SAINT JOHN'S WOOD AND PLACED OVER HER A TOMBSTONE WITH APPROPRIATE INSCRIPTIONS
4104-185522-0045 AS LATE AS EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE THERE WERE MANY FAMILIES OF BELIEVERS STILL EXISTING NEAR CHATHAM IN KENT AND EVEN IN THIS COUNTRY CAN HERE AND THERE BE FOUND ADMIRERS OF THE CREED OF JOANNA SOUTHCOTT
