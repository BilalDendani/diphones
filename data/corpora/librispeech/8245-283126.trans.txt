8245-283126-0000 AND STRENGTH OF MIND SUFFICIENT TO PERSEVERE IN A STEADY ADHERENCE TO A GENERAL AND A DISTANT INTEREST IN OPPOSITION TO THE ALLUREMENTS OF PRESENT PLEASURE AND ADVANTAGE THERE HAD NEVER IN THAT CASE BEEN ANY SUCH THING AS GOVERNMENT OR POLITICAL SOCIETY
8245-283126-0001 BUT EACH MAN FOLLOWING HIS NATURAL LIBERTY HAD LIVED IN ENTIRE PEACE AND HARMONY WITH ALL OTHERS WHAT NEED OF POSITIVE LAW WHERE NATURAL JUSTICE IS OF ITSELF A SUFFICIENT RESTRAINT
8245-283126-0002 WHY CREATE MAGISTRATES WHERE THERE NEVER ARISES ANY DISORDER OR INIQUITY WHY ABRIDGE OUR NATIVE FREEDOM WHEN IN EVERY INSTANCE
8245-283126-0003 IF GOVERNMENT WERE TOTALLY USELESS IT NEVER COULD HAVE PLACE AND THAT THE SOLE FOUNDATION OF THE DUTY OF ALLEGIANCE IS THE ADVANTAGE WHICH IT PROCURES TO SOCIETY BY PRESERVING PEACE AND ORDER AMONG MANKIND
8245-283126-0004 AND MAINTAIN A GREAT INTERCOURSE TOGETHER A NEW SET OF RULES ARE IMMEDIATELY DISCOVERED TO BE USEFUL IN THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION AND ACCORDINGLY TAKE PLACE UNDER THE TITLE OF LAWS OF NATIONS OF THIS KIND ARE
8245-283126-0005 ABSTAINING FROM POISONED ARMS QUARTER IN WAR WITH OTHERS OF THAT KIND WHICH ARE PLAINLY CALCULATED FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF STATES AND KINGDOMS IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH EACH OTHER THE RULES OF JUSTICE
8245-283126-0006 SUCH AS PREVAIL AMONG INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT ENTIRELY SUSPENDED AMONG POLITICAL SOCIETIES ALL PRINCES PRETEND A REGARD TO THE RIGHTS OF OTHER PRINCES AND SOME NO DOUBT WITHOUT HYPOCRISY
8245-283126-0007 ALLIANCES AND TREATIES ARE EVERY DAY MADE BETWEEN INDEPENDENT STATES WHICH WOULD ONLY BE SO MUCH WASTE OF PARCHMENT IF THEY WERE NOT FOUND BY EXPERIENCE TO HAVE SOME INFLUENCE AND AUTHORITY BUT HERE IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KINGDOMS AND INDIVIDUALS
8245-283126-0008 HUMAN NATURE CANNOT BY ANY MEANS SUBSIST WITHOUT THE ASSOCIATION OF INDIVIDUALS AND THAT ASSOCIATION NEVER COULD HAVE PLACE WERE NO REGARD PAID TO THE LAWS OF EQUITY AND JUSTICE DISORDER CONFUSION THE WAR OF ALL AGAINST ALL
8245-283126-0009 BUT NATIONS CAN SUBSIST WITHOUT INTERCOURSE THEY MAY EVEN SUBSIST IN SOME DEGREE UNDER A GENERAL WAR THE OBSERVANCE OF JUSTICE THOUGH USEFUL AMONG THEM
8245-283126-0010 HIS STEP MOTHER AND HER CHILDREN WERE AS MUCH SHUT UP FROM HIM AS THE WOMAN OF ANY OTHER FAMILY AND THERE WAS AS LITTLE DANGER OF ANY CRIMINAL CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THEM
8245-283126-0011 UNCLES AND NIECES FOR A LIKE REASON MIGHT MARRY AT ATHENS BUT NEITHER THESE NOR HALF BROTHERS AND SISTERS COULD CONTRACT THAT ALLIANCE AT ROME WHERE THE INTERCOURSE WAS MORE OPEN BETWEEN THE SEXES
8245-283126-0012 PUBLIC UTILITY IS THE CAUSE OF ALL THESE VARIATIONS TO REPEAT TO A MAN'S PREJUDICE ANYTHING THAT ESCAPED HIM IN PRIVATE CONVERSATION OR TO MAKE ANY SUCH USE OF HIS PRIVATE LETTERS IS HIGHLY BLAMED
8245-283126-0013 THE FREE AND SOCIAL INTERCOURSE OF MINDS MUST BE EXTREMELY CHECKED WHERE NO SUCH RULES OF FIDELITY ARE ESTABLISHED
8245-283126-0014 THE GIVING OF ONE'S AUTHOR IS REGARDED AS A PIECE OF INDISCRETION IF NOT OF IMMORALITY THESE STORIES IN PASSING FROM HAND TO HAND AND RECEIVING ALL THE USUAL VARIATIONS FREQUENTLY COME ABOUT TO THE PERSONS CONCERNED AND PRODUCE ANIMOSITIES AND QUARRELS AMONG PEOPLE
8245-283126-0015 WHOSE INTENTIONS ARE THE MOST INNOCENT AND INOFFENSIVE TO PRY INTO SECRETS TO OPEN OR EVEN READ THE LETTERS OF OTHERS TO PLAY THE SPY UPON THEIR WORDS AND LOOKS AND ACTIONS
8245-283126-0016 WHAT HABITS OF CONSEQUENCE MORE BLAMEABLE THIS PRINCIPLE IS ALSO THE FOUNDATION OF MOST OF THE LAWS OF GOOD MANNERS A KIND OF LESSER MORALITY CALCULATED FOR THE EASE OF COMPANY AND CONVERSATION
8245-283126-0017 TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE CEREMONY ARE BOTH BLAMED AND EVERYTHING WHICH PROMOTES EASE WITHOUT AN INDECENT FAMILIARITY IS USEFUL AND LAUDABLE CONSTANCY IN FRIENDSHIPS ATTACHMENTS AND FAMILIARITIES IS COMMENDABLE
8245-283126-0018 AND IS REQUISITE TO SUPPORT TRUST AND GOOD CORRESPONDENCE IN SOCIETY BUT IN PLACES OF GENERAL
8245-283126-0019 PUBLIC CONVENIENCY HAS DISPENSED WITH THIS MAXIM AND CUSTOM THERE PROMOTES AN UNRESERVED CONVERSATION FOR THE TIME BY INDULGING THE PRIVILEGE OF DROPPING AFTERWARDS EVERY INDIFFERENT ACQUAINTANCE WITHOUT BREACH OF CIVILITY OR GOOD MANNERS

8245-283126-0021 AMONG NATIONS WHERE AN IMMORAL GALLANTRY IF COVERED WITH A THIN VEIL OF MYSTERY IS IN SOME DEGREE AUTHORIZED BY CUSTOM THERE IMMEDIATELY ARISE A SET OF RULES CALCULATED FOR THE CONVENIENCY OF THAT ATTACHMENT
8245-283126-0022 THE FAMOUS COURT OR PARLIAMENT OF LOVE IN PROVENCE FORMERLY DECIDED ALL DIFFICULT CASES OF THIS NATURE IN SOCIETIES FOR PLAY THERE ARE LAWS REQUIRED FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE GAME AND THESE LAWS ARE DIFFERENT IN EACH GAME THE FOUNDATION I OWN
8245-283126-0023 OF SUCH SOCIETIES IS FRIVOLOUS
8245-283126-0024 THOUGH NOT ALTOGETHER CAPRICIOUS AND ARBITRARY SO FAR IS THERE A MATERIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND THE RULES OF JUSTICE FIDELITY AND LOYALTY THE GENERAL SOCIETIES OF MEN ARE ABSOLUTELY REQUISITE FOR THE SUBSISTENCE OF THE SPECIES
8245-283126-0025 AND THE PUBLIC CONVENIENCY WHICH REGULATES MORALS IS INVIOLABLY ESTABLISHED IN THE NATURE OF MAN AND OF THE WORLD IN WHICH HE LIVES THE COMPARISON THEREFORE
8245-283126-0026 WE MAY ONLY LEARN FROM IT THE NECESSITY OF RULES WHEREVER MEN HAVE ANY INTERCOURSE WITH EACH OTHER THEY CANNOT EVEN PASS EACH OTHER ON THE ROAD WITHOUT RULES WAGGONERS COACHMEN AND POSTILIONS HAVE PRINCIPLES BY WHICH THEY GIVE THE WAY
8245-283126-0027 AND THESE ARE CHIEFLY FOUNDED ON MUTUAL EASE AND CONVENIENCE
