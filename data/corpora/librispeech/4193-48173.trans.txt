4193-48173-0000 THE FRAGMENTS AMONGST THE PAPERS OF THE WELL KNOWN PHYSICIAN DOCTOR ROBERT MATHESON OF ASHLEY STREET PICCADILLY WHO DIED SUDDENLY OF APOPLECTIC SEIZURE AT THE BEGINNING OF EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO A LEAF OF MANUSCRIPT PAPER WAS FOUND
4193-48173-0001 COVERED WITH PENCIL JOTTINGS THESE NOTES WERE IN LATIN MUCH ABBREVIATED AND HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN MADE IN GREAT HASTE
4193-48173-0002 AND SOME WORDS HAVE UP TO THE PRESENT TIME EVADED ALL THE EFFORTS OF THE EXPERT EMPLOYED
4193-48173-0003 THE FOLLOWING IS A TRANSLATION OF DOCTOR MATHESON'S MANUSCRIPT WHETHER SCIENCE WOULD BENEFIT BY THESE BRIEF NOTES IF THEY COULD BE PUBLISHED I DO NOT KNOW BUT RATHER DOUBT
4193-48173-0004 TO USE IT OR TO BURN IT AS HE MAY THINK FIT AS WAS BEFITTING I DID ALL THAT MY KNOWLEDGE SUGGESTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I WAS SUFFERING UNDER NO DELUSION AT FIRST ASTOUNDED I COULD HARDLY THINK BUT IN A MINUTE'S TIME I WAS SURE THAT MY PULSE WAS STEADY AND REGULAR
4193-48173-0005 AND THAT I WAS IN MY REAL AND TRUE SENSES I THEN FIXED MY EYES QUIETLY ON WHAT WAS BEFORE ME THOUGH HORROR AND REVOLTING NAUSEA ROSE UP WITHIN ME AND AN ODOUR OF CORRUPTION CHOKED MY BREATH I REMAINED FIRM
4193-48173-0006 TO SEE THAT WHICH WAS ON THE BED LYING THERE BLACK LIKE INK TRANSFORMED BEFORE MY EYES THE SKIN AND THE FLESH AND THE MUSCLES AND THE BONES AND THE FIRM STRUCTURE OF THE HUMAN BODY THAT I HAD THOUGHT TO BE UNCHANGEABLE
4193-48173-0007 AND PERMANENT AS ADAMANT BEGAN TO MELT AND DISSOLVE I KNOW THAT THE BODY MAY BE SEPARATED INTO ITS ELEMENTS BY EXTERNAL AGENCIES BUT I SHOULD HAVE REFUSED TO BELIEVE WHAT I SAW FOR HERE THERE WAS SOME INTERNAL FORCE OF WHICH I KNEW NOTHING
4193-48173-0008 THAT CAUSED DISSOLUTION AND CHANGE HERE TOO WAS ALL THE WORK BY WHICH MAN HAD BEEN MADE REPEATED BEFORE MY EYES I SAW THE FORM WAVER FROM SEX TO SEX DIVIDING ITSELF FROM ITSELF AND THEN AGAIN REUNITED
4193-48173-0009 THEN I SAW THE BODY DESCEND TO THE BEASTS WHENCE IT ASCENDED AND THAT WHICH WAS ON THE HEIGHTS GO DOWN TO THE DEPTHS EVEN TO THE ABYSS OF ALL BEING THE PRINCIPLE OF LIFE WHICH MAKES ORGANISM ALWAYS REMAINED WHILE THE OUTWARD FORM CHANGED
4193-48173-0010 THE LIGHT WITHIN THE ROOM HAD TURNED TO BLACKNESS NOT THE DARKNESS OF NIGHT IN WHICH OBJECTS ARE SEEN DIMLY FOR I COULD SEE CLEARLY AND WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT IT WAS THE NEGATION OF LIGHT OBJECTS WERE PRESENTED TO MY EYES IF I MAY SAY SO WITHOUT ANY MEDIUM
4193-48173-0011 FOR ONE INSTANCE I SAW A FORM SHAPED IN DIMNESS BEFORE ME WHICH I WILL NOT FARTHER DESCRIBE BUT THE SYMBOL OF THIS FORM MAY BE SEEN IN ANCIENT SCULPTURES AND IN PAINTINGS WHICH SURVIVED BENEATH THE LAVA TOO FOUL TO BE SPOKEN OF
4193-48173-0012 AS A HORRIBLE AND UNSPEAKABLE SHAPE NEITHER MAN NOR BEAST WAS CHANGED INTO HUMAN FORM THERE CAME FINALLY DEATH I WHO SAW ALL THIS NOT WITHOUT GREAT HORROR AND LOATHING OF SOUL HERE WRITE MY NAME
4193-48173-0013 DECLARING ALL THAT I HAVE SET ON THIS PAPER TO BE TRUE ROBERT MATHESON
4193-48173-0014 SUCH RAYMOND IS THE STORY OF WHAT I KNOW AND WHAT I HAVE SEEN THE BURDEN OF IT WAS TOO HEAVY FOR ME TO BEAR ALONE AND YET I COULD TELL IT TO NONE BUT YOU VILLIERS WHO WAS WITH ME AT THE LAST KNOWS NOTHING OF THAT AWFUL SECRET OF THE WOOD
4193-48173-0015 OF HOW WHAT WE BOTH SAW DIE LAY UPON THE SMOOTH SWEET TURF AMIDST THE SUMMER FLOWERS HALF IN SUN AND HALF IN SHADOW AND HOLDING THE GIRL RACHEL'S HAND CALLED AND SUMMONED THOSE COMPANIONS AND SHAPED IN SOLID FORM UPON THE EARTH WE TREAD UPON
4193-48173-0016 THE HORROR WHICH WE CAN BUT HINT AT WHICH WE CAN ONLY NAME UNDER A FIGURE
4193-48173-0017 NOR OF THAT RESEMBLANCE WHICH STRUCK ME AS WITH A BLOW UPON MY HEART WHEN I SAW THE PORTRAIT WHICH FILLED THE CUP OF TERROR AT THE END WHAT THIS CAN MEAN I DARE NOT GUESS I KNOW THAT WHAT I SAW PERISH WAS NOT MARY AND YET IN THE LAST AGONY MARY'S EYES LOOKED INTO MINE
4193-48173-0018 WHETHER THERE CAN BE ANY ONE WHO CAN SHOW THE LAST LINK IN THIS CHAIN OF AWFUL MYSTERY I DO NOT KNOW BUT IF THERE BE ANY ONE WHO CAN DO THIS YOU RAYMOND ARE THE MAN AND IF YOU KNOW THE SECRET IT RESTS WITH YOU TO TELL IT OR NOT AS YOU PLEASE
4193-48173-0019 I AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU IMMEDIATELY ON MY GETTING BACK TO TOWN I HAVE BEEN IN THE COUNTRY FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS PERHAPS YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GUESS IN WHICH PART WHILE THE HORROR AND WONDER OF LONDON WAS AT ITS HEIGHT
4193-48173-0020 FOR MISSUS BEAUMONT AS I HAVE TOLD YOU WAS WELL KNOWN IN SOCIETY I WROTE TO MY FRIEND DOCTOR PHILLIPS GIVING SOME BRIEF OUTLINE OR RATHER HINT OF WHAT HAPPENED AND ASKING HIM TO TELL ME THE NAME OF THE VILLAGE WHERE THE EVENTS HE HAD RELATED TO ME OCCURRED HE GAVE ME THE NAME
4193-48173-0021 AS HE SAID WITH THE LESS HESITATION BECAUSE RACHEL'S FATHER AND MOTHER WERE DEAD AND THE REST OF THE FAMILY HAD GONE TO A RELATIVE IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON SIX MONTHS BEFORE THE PARENTS HE SAID HAD UNDOUBTEDLY DIED OF GRIEF AND HORROR CAUSED BY THE TERRIBLE DEATH OF THEIR DAUGHTER
4193-48173-0022 ON THE EVENING OF THE DAY WHICH I RECEIVED PHILLIPS LETTER I WAS AT CAERMAEN AND STANDING BENEATH THE MOULDERING ROMAN WALLS WHITE WITH THE WINTERS OF SEVENTEEN HUNDRED YEARS I LOOKED OVER THE MEADOW WHERE ONCE HAD STOOD THE OLDER TEMPLE OF THE GOD OF THE DEEPS
4193-48173-0023 AND SAW A HOUSE GLEAMING IN THE SUNLIGHT IT WAS THE HOUSE WHERE HELEN HAD LIVED I STAYED AT CAERMAEN FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE PEOPLE OF THE PLACE I FOUND KNEW LITTLE AND HAD GUESSED LESS THOSE WHOM I SPOKE TO ON THE MATTER SEEMED SURPRISED THAT AN ANTIQUARIAN
4193-48173-0024 AS I PROFESSED MYSELF TO BE SHOULD TROUBLE ABOUT A VILLAGE TRAGEDY OF WHICH THEY GAVE A VERY COMMONPLACE VERSION AND AS YOU MAY IMAGINE I TOLD NOTHING OF WHAT I KNEW MOST OF MY TIME WAS SPENT IN THE GREAT WOOD THAT RISES JUST ABOVE THE VILLAGE AND CLIMBS THE HILLSIDE
4193-48173-0025 AND GOES DOWN TO THE RIVER IN THE VALLEY SUCH ANOTHER LONG LOVELY VALLEY RAYMOND AS THAT ON WHICH WE LOOKED ONE SUMMER NIGHT WALKING TO AND FRO BEFORE YOUR HOUSE FOR MANY AN HOUR I STRAYED THROUGH THE MAZE OF THE FOREST TURNING NOW TO RIGHT AND NOW TO LEFT
4193-48173-0026 PACING SLOWLY DOWN LONG ALLEYS OF UNDERGROWTH SHADOWY AND CHILL EVEN UNDER THE MIDDAY SUN AND HALTING BENEATH GREAT OAKS LYING ON THE SHORT TURF OF A CLEARING WHERE THE FAINT SWEET SCENT OF WILD ROSES CAME TO ME ON THE WIND AND MIXED WITH THE HEAVY PERFUME OF THE ELDER
4193-48173-0027 WHOSE MINGLED ODOUR IS LIKE THE ODOUR OF THE ROOM OF THE DEAD A VAPOUR OF INCENSE AND CORRUPTION I STOOD AT THE EDGES OF THE WOOD GAZING AT ALL THE POMP AND PROCESSION OF THE FOXGLOVES TOWERING AMIDST THE BRACKEN AND SHINING RED IN THE BROAD SUNSHINE
4193-48173-0028 AND BEYOND THEM INTO DEEP THICKETS OF CLOSE UNDERGROWTH WHERE SPRINGS BOIL UP FROM THE ROCK AND NOURISH THE WATER WEEDS DANK AND EVIL BUT IN ALL MY WANDERINGS I AVOIDED ONE PART OF THE WOOD IT WAS NOT TILL YESTERDAY THAT I CLIMBED TO THE SUMMIT OF THE HILL
4193-48173-0029 AND STOOD UPON THE ANCIENT ROMAN ROAD THAT THREADS THE HIGHEST RIDGE OF THE WOOD HERE THEY HAD WALKED HELEN AND RACHEL ALONG THIS QUIET CAUSEWAY UPON THE PAVEMENT OF GREEN TURF SHUT IN ON EITHER SIDE BY HIGH BANKS OF RED EARTH
4193-48173-0030 AND TALL HEDGES OF SHINING BEECH AND HERE I FOLLOWED IN THEIR STEPS LOOKING OUT NOW AND AGAIN THROUGH PARTINGS IN THE BOUGHS AND SEEING ON ONE SIDE THE SWEEP OF THE WOOD STRETCHING FAR TO RIGHT AND LEFT AND SINKING INTO THE BROAD LEVEL AND BEYOND THE YELLOW SEA
4193-48173-0031 AND THE LAND OVER THE SEA ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS THE VALLEY AND THE RIVER AND HILL FOLLOWING HILL AS WAVE ON WAVE AND WOOD AND MEADOW AND CORNFIELD AND WHITE HOUSES GLEAMING AND A GREAT WALL OF MOUNTAIN AND FAR BLUE PEAKS IN THE NORTH
4193-48173-0032 AND INTO THIS PLEASANT SUMMER GLADE RACHEL PASSED A GIRL AND LEFT IT WHO SHALL SAY WHAT I DID NOT STAY LONG THERE IN A SMALL TOWN NEAR CAERMAEN THERE IS A MUSEUM
4193-48173-0033 CONTAINING FOR THE MOST PART ROMAN REMAINS WHICH HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AT VARIOUS TIMES ON THE DAY AFTER MY ARRIVAL IN CAERMAEN I WALKED OVER TO THE TOWN IN QUESTION AND TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF INSPECTING THE MUSEUM
4193-48173-0034 FRAGMENTS OF TESSELLATED PAVEMENT WHICH THE PLACE CONTAINS I WAS SHOWN A SMALL SQUARE PILLAR OF WHITE STONE WHICH HAD BEEN RECENTLY DISCOVERED IN THE WOOD OF WHICH I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING AND AS I FOUND ON INQUIRY IN THAT OPEN SPACE WHERE THE ROMAN ROAD BROADENS OUT
4193-48173-0035 ON ONE SIDE OF THE PILLAR WAS AN INSCRIPTION OF WHICH I TOOK A NOTE SOME OF THE LETTERS HAVE BEEN DEFACED BUT I DO NOT THINK THERE CAN BE ANY DOUBT AS TO THOSE WHICH I SUPPLY THE INSCRIPTION IS AS FOLLOWS
4193-48173-0036 TO THE GREAT GOD NODENS THE GOD OF THE GREAT DEEP OR ABYSS FLAVIUS SENILIS HAS ERECTED THIS PILLAR ON ACCOUNT OF THE MARRIAGE WHICH HE SAW BENEATH THE SHADE
4193-48173-0037 THE CUSTODIAN OF THE MUSEUM INFORMED ME THAT LOCAL ANTIQUARIES WERE MUCH PUZZLED NOT BY THE INSCRIPTION OR BY ANY DIFFICULTY IN TRANSLATING IT BUT AS TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE OR RITE TO WHICH ALLUSION IS MADE
4193-48173-0038 AND NOW MY DEAR CLARKE AS TO WHAT YOU TELL ME ABOUT HELEN VAUGHAN WHOM YOU SAY YOU SAW DIE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE UTMOST AND ALMOST INCREDIBLE HORROR I WAS INTERESTED IN YOUR ACCOUNT
4193-48173-0039 BUT A GOOD DEAL NAY ALL OF WHAT YOU TOLD ME I KNEW ALREADY I CAN UNDERSTAND THE STRANGE LIKENESS YOU REMARKED IN BOTH THE PORTRAIT AND IN THE ACTUAL FACE
4193-48173-0040 YOU REMEMBER THAT STILL SUMMER NIGHT SO MANY YEARS AGO
4193-48173-0041 AND OF THE GOD PAN YOU REMEMBER MARY SHE WAS THE MOTHER OF HELEN VAUGHAN WHO WAS BORN NINE MONTHS AFTER THAT NIGHT MARY NEVER RECOVERED HER REASON SHE LAY AS YOU SAW HER ALL THE WHILE UPON HER BED
4193-48173-0042 AND A FEW DAYS AFTER THE CHILD WAS BORN SHE DIED I FANCY THAT JUST AT THE LAST SHE KNEW ME I WAS STANDING BY THE BED AND THE OLD LOOK CAME INTO HER EYES FOR A SECOND AND THEN SHE SHUDDERED AND GROANED AND DIED
4193-48173-0043 IT WAS AN ILL WORK I DID THAT NIGHT WHEN YOU WERE PRESENT I BROKE OPEN THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE OF LIFE WITHOUT KNOWING OR CARING WHAT MIGHT PASS FORTH OR ENTER IN I RECOLLECT YOUR TELLING ME AT THE TIME SHARPLY ENOUGH AND RIGHTLY TOO IN ONE SENSE
4193-48173-0044 THAT I HAD RUINED THE REASON OF A HUMAN BEING BY A FOOLISH EXPERIMENT BASED ON AN ABSURD THEORY YOU DID WELL TO BLAME ME BUT MY THEORY WAS NOT ALL ABSURDITY WHAT I SAID MARY WOULD SEE SHE SAW
4193-48173-0045 BUT I FORGOT THAT NO HUMAN EYES CAN LOOK ON SUCH A SIGHT WITH IMPUNITY AND I FORGOT AS I HAVE JUST SAID THAT WHEN THE HOUSE OF LIFE IS THUS THROWN OPEN THERE MAY ENTER IN THAT FOR WHICH WE HAVE NO NAME AND HUMAN FLESH MAY BECOME THE VEIL OF A HORROR ONE DARE NOT EXPRESS
4193-48173-0046 I PLAYED WITH ENERGIES WHICH I DID NOT UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE SEEN THE ENDING OF IT HELEN VAUGHAN DID WELL TO BIND THE CORD ABOUT HER NECK AND DIE THOUGH THE DEATH WAS HORRIBLE THE BLACKENED FACE THE HIDEOUS FORM UPON THE BED
4193-48173-0047 CHANGING AND MELTING BEFORE YOUR EYES FROM WOMAN TO MAN FROM MAN TO BEAST AND FROM BEAST TO WORSE THAN BEAST ALL THE STRANGE HORROR THAT YOU WITNESS SURPRISES ME BUT LITTLE WHAT YOU SAY THE DOCTOR WHOM YOU SENT FOR SAW AND SHUDDERED AT I NOTICED LONG AGO
4193-48173-0048 I KNEW WHAT I HAD DONE THE MOMENT THE CHILD WAS BORN AND WHEN IT WAS SCARCELY FIVE YEARS OLD I SURPRISED IT NOT ONCE OR TWICE BUT SEVERAL TIMES WITH A PLAYMATE YOU MAY GUESS OF WHAT KIND IT WAS FOR ME A CONSTANT AN INCARNATE HORROR
4193-48173-0049 AND AFTER A FEW YEARS I FELT I COULD BEAR IT NO MORE AND I SENT HELEN VAUGHAN AWAY YOU KNOW NOW WHAT FRIGHTENED THE BOY IN THE WOOD THE REST OF THE STRANGE STORY AND ALL ELSE THAT YOU TELL ME
4193-48173-0050 AS DISCOVERED BY YOUR FRIEND I HAVE CONTRIVED TO LEARN FROM TIME TO TIME ALMOST TO THE LAST CHAPTER AND NOW
