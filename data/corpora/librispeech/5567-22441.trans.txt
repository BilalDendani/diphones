5567-22441-0022 I WOULD NOT TROUBLE HIM WITH TOO MANY DIRECTIONS FOR FEAR OF EMBROIL
5567-22441-0023 YESTERDAY AND FOUND BY A FRIGATE THAT ADMIRAL CORNWALLIS HAD A RENDEZVOUS AT SEA THITHER WE WENT BUT TO THIS HOUR CANNOT FIND HIM IT BLOWS STRONG WHAT WIND WE ARE LOSING
5567-22441-0024 AND LEAVE THE VICTORY TO MY GREAT MORTIFICATION SO MUCH FOR THE WISDOM OF MY SUPERIORS I KEEP MY LETTER OPEN TO THE LAST FOR I STILL HOPE AS I AM SURE THERE IS NO GOOD REASON FOR MY NOT GOING OUT IN THE VICTORY
5567-22441-0025 MAY GOD IN HEAVEN BLESS YOU PRAYS YOUR MOST SINCERE NELSON AND BRONTE STEPHENS'S PUBLICATION I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE I HAVE LEFT MY SILVER SEAL AT LEAST I CANNOT FIND IT
5567-22441-0026 MY DEAREST EMMA ALTHOUGH I HAVE WROTE LETTERS FROM VARIOUS PLACES MERELY TO SAY HERE I AM AND THERE I AM YET
5567-22441-0027 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY MORE THAN HERE I AM AND WELL AND I SEE NO PROSPECT OF ANY CERTAIN MODE OF CONVEYANCE BUT BY SEA WHICH
5567-22441-0028 HAS GIVEN ME OF SMALL VESSELS CAN BE BUT SELDOM OUR PASSAGES HAVE BEEN ENORMOUSLY LONG FROM GIBRALTAR TO MALTA WE WERE ELEVEN DAYS ARRIVING THE FIFTEENTH IN THE EVENING AND SAILING
5567-22441-0029 IN THE NIGHT OF THE SIXTEENTH THAT IS THREE IN THE MORNING OF THE SEVENTEENTH AND IT WAS THE TWENTY SIXTH BEFORE WE GOT OFF CAPRI
5567-22441-0030 WHICH CARRIED MISTER ELLIOT TO NAPLES TO JOIN ME I SEND YOU COPIES OF THE KING AND QUEEN'S LETTERS I AM VEXED THAT SHE DID NOT MENTION YOU I CAN ONLY ACCOUNT FOR IT BY HER'S BEING A POLITICAL LETTER
5567-22441-0031 WHEN I WROTE TO THE QUEEN I SAID
5567-22441-0032 YOUR MAJESTY NEVER HAD A MORE SINCERE ATTACHED AND REAL FRIEND THAN YOUR DEAR EMMA YOU WILL BE SORRY TO HEAR THAT GOOD SIR WILLIAM DID NOT LEAVE HER IN SUCH COMFORTABLE CIRCUMSTANCES AS HIS FORTUNE WOULD HAVE ALLOWED
5567-22441-0033 HE HAS GIVEN IT AMONGST HIS RELATIONS BUT SHE WILL DO HONOUR TO HIS MEMORY ALTHOUGH EVERY ONE ELSE OF HIS FRIENDS CALL LOUDLY AGAINST HIM ON THAT ACCOUNT
5567-22441-0034 IF SHE CAN FORGET EMMA I HOPE GOD WILL FORGET HER BUT YOU THINK THAT SHE NEVER WILL OR CAN NOW IS HER TIME TO SHEW IT
5567-22441-0035 THE KING IS VERY LOW LIVES MOSTLY AT BELVIDERE MISTER ELLIOT HAD NOT SEEN EITHER HIM OR THE QUEEN FROM THE SEVENTEENTH THE DAY OF HIS ARRIVAL TO THE TWENTY FIRST ON THE NEXT DAY HE WAS TO BE PRESENTED
5567-22441-0036 I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND THAT IT IS PART OF THE PLAN OF THAT CORSICAN SCOUNDREL TO CONQUER THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES HE HAS MARCHED THIRTEEN THOUSAND MEN INTO THE KINGDOM ON THE ADRIATIC SIDE AND HE WILL TAKE POSSESSION
5567-22441-0037 AND IF THE POOR KING REMONSTRATES OR ALLOWS US TO SECURE SICILY
5567-22441-0038 I HAVE CAUTIONED GENERAL ACTON NOT TO RISK THE ROYAL FAMILY TOO LONG BUT NAPLES WILL BE CONQUERED SOONER OR LATER AS IT MAY SUIT BUONAPARTE'S CONVENIENCE THE MOREA AND EGYPT ARE LIKEWISE IN HIS EYE
5567-22441-0039 AN ARMY OF FULL SEVENTY THOUSAND MEN ARE ASSEMBLING IN ITALY GIBBS AND NOBLE ARE GONE TO MALTA I AM YOU MAY BELIEVE VERY ANXIOUS TO GET OFF TOULON TO JOIN THE FLEET
5567-22441-0040 WE PASSED MONTE CHRISTO
5567-22441-0041 YESTERDAY AND ARE NOW MOVING SLOWLY DIRECT FOR TOULON
5567-22441-0042 SOME SAY NINE SAIL OF THE LINE SOME SEVEN SOME FIVE IF THE FORMER THEY WILL COME OUT FOR WE HAVE ONLY THE SAME NUMBER INCLUDING SIXTY FOURS AND VERY SHORTLY MANNED HOWEVER
5567-22441-0043 I LEFT THIS HOLE TO PUT DOWN WHAT FORCE THE FRENCH HAVE AT TOULON SEVEN SAIL OF THE LINE READY FIVE FRIGATES AND SIX CORVETTES
5567-22441-0044 OF THE LINE TO MORROW SEVEN INCLUDING TWO SIXTY FOUR GUN SHIPS YOU WILL READILY BELIEVE HOW REJOICED I SHALL BE TO GET ONE OF YOUR DEAR EXCELLENT LETTERS THAT I MAY KNOW EVERY THING WHICH HAS PASSED SINCE MY ABSENCE
5567-22441-0045 I SINCERELY HOPE THAT MISTER BOOTH HAS SETTLED ALL YOUR ACCOUNTS NEVER MIND MY DEAR EMMA A FEW HUNDRED POUNDS WHICH IS ALL THE RIGID GRIPE OF THE LAW NOT JUSTICE CAN WREST FROM YOU I THANK GOD THAT YOU CANNOT WANT
5567-22441-0046 WHILST I HAVE SIXPENCE YOU SHALL NOT WANT FOR FIVEPENCE OF IT BUT YOU HAVE BOUGHT YOUR EXPERIENCE THAT THERE IS NO FRIENDSHIP IN MONEY CONCERNS AND
5567-22441-0047 INDEPENDENCE IS A BLESSING AND ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT YET FOUND OUT THE WAY TO GET PRIZE MONEY WHAT HAS BEEN TAKEN HAS RUN INTO OUR MOUTHS HOWEVER IT MUST TURN OUT VERY HARD IF I CANNOT GET ENOUGH TO PAY OFF MY DEBTS
5567-22441-0048 AND THAT WILL BE NO SMALL COMFORT
5567-22441-0049 BUT IF NAPLES REMAINS MUCH LONGER I SHALL ASK THE QUESTION BUT I EXPECT NOTHING FROM THEM I BELIEVE EVEN ACTON WISHES HIMSELF WELL AND SAFELY REMOVED
5567-22441-0050 I THINK FROM WHAT I HEAR THAT THE KING'S SPIRITS ARE SO MUCH DEPRESSED THAT HE WILL GIVE UP THE REINS OF NAPLES AT LEAST TO HIS SON AND RETIRE TO SICILY SIR WILLIAM YOU KNOW ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD END HIS LIFE SO
5567-22441-0051 CERTAINLY HIS SITUATION MUST BE HEART BREAKING GAETANO RETURNED IN THE FRIGATE I BELIEVE HE SAW ENOUGH OF NAPLES HE CARRIED HIS FAMILY MONEY AND MISTER FALCONET
5567-22441-0052 GIBBS BEING ABSENT WILL PAY MISTER GREVILLE'S PENSION TO GAETANO'S FAMILY I HAVE NOW SENT GAETANO TO THE POST AND HE DESIRES TO PRESENT HIS DUTY AND TO TELL YOU THAT MISTER RAGLAND
5567-22441-0053 WILL NOT PAY ANY MORE PENSIONS WITHOUT ORDERS FROM MISTER GREVILLE VINCENZO HAS HAD NONE PAID HE IS VERY POOR KEEPS A SHOP
5567-22441-0054 I CANNOT AFFORD TO MAINTAIN HIM THEREFORE I SHALL GIVE NO ENCOURAGEMENT OLD ANTONIO WAS ALLOWED A CARLINE A DAY THAT IS NOW NOT PAID SABATELLO LIVES WITH MISTER ELLIOT
5567-22441-0055 NICOLO AND MARY ANTONIO HAVE LEFT MISTER GIBBS FOR SOME CAUSE GAETANO SAYS HE BELIEVES FOR AMORE FRANCESCA HAS TWO CHILDREN LIVING AND ANOTHER COMING SHE LIVES THE BEST AMONGST THEM LIKE GALLANT HOMME
5567-22441-0056 PASQUAL LIVES WITH THE DUKE MONTELIONE AND JOSEPH WITH THE OLD RUSSIAN YOUR HOUSE IS A HOTEL THE UPPER PARTS ARE KEPT FOR THE MARQUIS THE OWNER
5567-22441-0057 INQUIRED KINDLY AFTER US AND ALL THE WOMEN AT SANTA LUCIA EXPECTED WHEN THEY SAW GAETANO THAT YOU WAS ARRIVED BREAD NEVER WAS SO DEAR
