242-122625-0000 A PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION OF JANE EYRE BEING UNNECESSARY I GAVE NONE THIS SECOND EDITION DEMANDS A FEW WORDS BOTH OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND MISCELLANEOUS REMARK MY THANKS ARE DUE IN THREE QUARTERS
242-122625-0001 I SAY CORDIALLY GENTLEMEN I THANK YOU FROM MY HEART
242-122625-0002 I TURN TO ANOTHER CLASS A SMALL ONE SO FAR AS I KNOW BUT NOT THEREFORE TO BE OVERLOOKED I MEAN THE TIMOROUS OR CARPING FEW WHO DOUBT THE TENDENCY OF SUCH BOOKS AS JANE EYRE IN WHOSE EYES WHATEVER IS UNUSUAL IS WRONG
242-122625-0003 WHOSE EARS DETECT IN EACH PROTEST AGAINST BIGOTRY THAT PARENT OF CRIME AN INSULT TO PIETY THAT REGENT OF GOD ON EARTH I WOULD SUGGEST TO SUCH DOUBTERS CERTAIN OBVIOUS DISTINCTIONS
242-122625-0004 CONVENTIONALITY IS NOT MORALITY SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS IS NOT RELIGION TO ATTACK THE FIRST IS NOT TO ASSAIL THE LAST TO PLUCK THE MASK FROM THE FACE OF THE PHARISEE IS NOT TO LIFT AN IMPIOUS HAND TO THE CROWN OF THORNS
242-122625-0005 THESE THINGS AND DEEDS ARE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED
242-122625-0006 MEN TOO OFTEN CONFOUND THEM THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONFOUNDED APPEARANCE SHOULD NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR TRUTH NARROW HUMAN DOCTRINES THAT ONLY TEND TO ELATE AND MAGNIFY A FEW SHOULD NOT BE SUBSTITUTED FOR THE WORLD REDEEMING CREED OF CHRIST
242-122625-0007 TO LET WHITE WASHED WALLS VOUCH FOR CLEAN SHRINES
242-122625-0008 BUT HATE AS IT WILL IT IS INDEBTED TO HIM AHAB DID NOT LIKE MICAIAH BECAUSE HE NEVER PROPHESIED GOOD CONCERNING HIM BUT EVIL
242-122625-0009 AS THE VERY MASTER OF THAT WORKING CORPS WHO WOULD RESTORE TO RECTITUDE THE WARPED SYSTEM OF THINGS BECAUSE I THINK NO COMMENTATOR ON HIS WRITINGS HAS YET FOUND THE COMPARISON THAT SUITS HIM THE TERMS WHICH RIGHTLY CHARACTERISE HIS TALENT
242-122625-0010 NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION
242-122625-0011 AN HONOUR IS AWARDED WHERE IT IS NOT MERITED AND CONSEQUENTLY DENIED WHERE IT IS JUSTLY DUE
