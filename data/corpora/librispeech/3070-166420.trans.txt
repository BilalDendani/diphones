3070-166420-0000 VALLEY OF THE BLUE POPPIES IN THIS GREAT CRUCIBLE OF LIFE WE CALL THE WORLD IN THE VASTER ONE WE CALL THE UNIVERSE THE MYSTERIES LIE CLOSE PACKED
3070-166420-0001 UNCOUNTABLE AS GRAINS OF SAND ON OCEAN'S SHORES THEY THREAD GIGANTIC THE STAR FLUNG SPACES THEY CREEP ATOMIC BENEATH THE MICROSCOPE'S PEERING EYE THEY WALK BESIDE US
3070-166420-0002 ASKING WHY WE ARE DEAF TO THEIR CRYING BLIND TO THEIR WONDER SOMETIMES THE VEILS DROP FROM A MAN'S EYES AND HE SEES AND SPEAKS OF HIS VISION
3070-166420-0003 THEN THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN PASS HIM BY WITH THE LIFTED BROWS OF DISBELIEF OR THEY MOCK HIM OR IF HIS VISION HAS BEEN GREAT ENOUGH THEY FALL UPON
3070-166420-0004 AND UPON AND ABOUT IT SHIFTING AND CHANGING ADDING TO OR TAKING AWAY BEAT OVER LEGIONS OF FORCES SEEN AND UNSEEN KNOWN AND UNKNOWN AND MAN AN ATOM IN THE FERMENT
3070-166420-0005 CLINGS DESPERATELY TO WHAT TO HIM SEEMS STABLE NOR GREETS WITH JOY HIM WHO HAZARDS THAT WHAT HE GRIPS
3070-166420-0006 IF TO THE VOYAGERS PAINFULLY PLOTTING THEIR COURSE COMES ONE WHO CRIES THAT THEIR CHARTS MUST BE REMADE NOR CAN TELL WHY THEY MUST BE THAT MAN IS NOT WELCOME NO
3070-166420-0007 NOT OF FORGETFULNESS FOR THAT COULD NEVER BE BUT OF ANODYNE FOR A SORROW WHICH HAD HELD FAST UPON ME SINCE MY RETURN FROM THE CAROLINES A YEAR BEFORE
3070-166420-0008 IT HAS BEEN WRITTEN NOR SHALL I RECITE THE REASONS FOR MY RESTLESSNESS FOR THESE ARE KNOWN TO THOSE WHO HAVE READ THAT HISTORY OF MINE
3070-166420-0009 I DETERMINED TO RETURN TO THAT QUIET FORBIDDEN LAND THERE IF ANYWHERE MIGHT I FIND SOMETHING AKIN TO FORGETTING
3070-166420-0010 PERSIA'S MOUNTAINOUS CHAIN THAT EXTENDS FROM AZERBAIJAN IN THE WEST TO KHORASAN IN THE EAST FROM THENCE I WOULD FOLLOW ITS MODIFIED TYPES IN THE HINDU KUSH RANGES AND ITS MIGRATIONS ALONG THE SOUTHERN SCARPS OF THE TRANS HIMALAYAS THE UNEXPLORED UPHEAVAL
3070-166420-0011 HIGHER THAN THE HIMALAYAS THEMSELVES MORE DEEPLY CUT WITH PRECIPICE AND GORGE WHICH SVEN HEDIN HAD TOUCHED AND NAMED ON HIS JOURNEY TO LHASA HAVING ACCOMPLISHED THIS
3070-166420-0012 I PLANNED TO PUSH ACROSS THE PASSES TO THE MANASAROWAR LAKES WHERE LEGEND HAS IT THE STRANGE LUMINOUS PURPLE LOTUSES GROW AN AMBITIOUS PROJECT UNDENIABLY FRAUGHT WITH DANGER
3070-166420-0013 BUT IT IS WRITTEN THAT DESPERATE DISEASES REQUIRE DESPERATE REMEDIES AND UNTIL INSPIRATION OR MESSAGE HOW TO REJOIN THOSE WHOM I HAD LOVED SO DEARLY CAME TO ME NOTHING LESS I FELT COULD DULL MY HEARTACHE AND FRANKLY
3070-166420-0014 AND THAT I HAD FOUND HIM HE RECOMMENDED HIMSELF TO ME AS THE BEST COOK WITHIN TEN THOUSAND MILES OF PEKIN FOR ALMOST THREE MONTHS WE HAD JOURNEYED CHIU MING
3070-166420-0015 TO THE HORDES OF THE SATRAPS THE HIGHWAYS OF THE ACHAEMENIDS YES AND WHICH BEFORE THEM HAD TREMBLED TO THE TRAMPLINGS OF THE MYRIADS OF THE GODLIKE DRAVIDIAN CONQUERORS
3070-166420-0016 THE FEET OF AN AMERICAN BOTANIST A CHINAMAN TWO TIBETAN PONIES
3070-166420-0017 UNTIL AT LAST BOTH FELL BEFORE THE TURKS OVER THE HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS OF PERSIA'S GLORY PERSIA'S SHAME AND PERSIA'S DEATH WE FOUR TWO MEN TWO BEASTS HAD PASSED FOR A FORTNIGHT WE HAD MET NO HUMAN SOUL
3070-166420-0018 SEEN NO SIGN OF HUMAN HABITATION GAME HAD BEEN PLENTIFUL GREEN THINGS CHIU MING MIGHT LACK FOR HIS COOKING BUT MEAT NEVER ABOUT US WAS A WELTER OF MIGHTY SUMMITS WE WERE I KNEW
3070-166420-0019 SERENE MAJESTIC IMMUTABLE LIKE THE UNTROUBLED CALM WHICH RESTS THE BURMESE BELIEVE OVER EVERY PLACE WHICH HAS GUARDED THE BUDDHA SLEEPING
3070-166420-0020 FAR TO THE WEST ANOTHER GRAY AND OCHREOUS GIANT REARED ITS BULK CLOSING THE VALE NORTH AND SOUTH THE HORIZON WAS A CHAOTIC SKY LAND OF PINNACLES SPIRED AND MINARETED STEEPLED AND TURRETED AND DOMED
3070-166420-0021 EACH DIADEMED WITH ITS GREEN AND ARGENT OF ETERNAL ICE AND SNOW AND ALL THE VALLEY WAS CARPETED WITH THE BLUE POPPIES IN WIDE UNBROKEN FIELDS LUMINOUS AS THE MORNING SKIES OF MID JUNE
3070-166420-0022 HASTENING PRESENCES LIKE A VAST PRAYER RUG SAPPHIRE AND SILKEN THE POPPIES STRETCHED TO THE GRAY FEET OF THE MOUNTAIN BETWEEN THEIR SOUTHERN EDGE AND THE CLUSTERING SUMMITS
3070-166420-0023 A ROW OF FADED BROWN LOW HILLS KNELT LIKE BROWN ROBED WITHERED AND WEARY OLD MEN BACKS BENT FACES HIDDEN BETWEEN OUTSTRETCHED ARMS PALMS TO THE EARTH AND BROWS TOUCHING EARTH WITHIN THEM
3070-166420-0024 IN THE EAST'S IMMEMORIAL ATTITUDE OF WORSHIP I HALF EXPECTED THEM TO RISE AND AS I WATCHED A MAN APPEARED ON ONE OF THE BOWED ROCKY SHOULDERS ABRUPTLY WITH THE EVER STARTLING SUDDENNESS
3070-166420-0025 WHICH IN THE STRANGE LIGHT OF THESE LATITUDES OBJECTS SPRING INTO VISION AS HE STOOD SCANNING MY CAMP THERE AROSE BESIDE HIM A LADEN PONY AND AT ITS HEAD A TIBETAN PEASANT
3070-166420-0026 I'M DICK DRAKE HE SAID HOLDING OUT HIS HAND RICHARD KEEN DRAKE
3070-166420-0027 MY NAME IS GOODWIN I TOOK HIS HAND SHOOK IT WARMLY DOCTOR WALTER T GOODWIN GOODWIN THE BOTANIST THEN I KNOW YOU HE EXCLAIMED KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU THAT IS

3070-166420-0029 BUT WHAT WAS HIS SON DOING IN THIS WILDERNESS WONDERING WHERE I CAME FROM HE ANSWERED MY UNSPOKEN QUESTION SHORT STORY WAR ENDED FELT AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING MORE DIFFERENT FROM TIBET
3070-166420-0030 ALWAYS WANTED TO GO THERE ANYWAY WENT DECIDED TO STRIKE OVER TOWARD TURKESTAN AND HERE I AM I FELT AT ONCE A STRONG LIKING FOR THIS YOUNG GIANT NO DOUBT SUBCONSCIOUSLY I HAD BEEN FEELING THE NEED OF COMPANIONSHIP WITH MY OWN KIND
3070-166420-0031 I EVEN WONDERED AS I LED THE WAY INTO MY LITTLE CAMP WHETHER HE WOULD CARE TO JOIN FORTUNES WITH ME IN MY JOURNEYINGS HIS FATHER'S WORK I KNEW WELL AND ALTHOUGH THIS STALWART LAD WAS UNLIKE WHAT ONE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED ALVIN DRAKE
3070-166420-0032 EVER THE SPECULATION GREW IN HIS FACE AS HE MADE AWAY WITH CHIU MING'S ARTFUL CONCOCTIONS DRAKE SIGHED DRAWING OUT HIS PIPE A COOK A MARVEL OF A COOK WHERE DID YOU GET HIM
3070-166420-0033 BRIEFLY I TOLD HIM THEN A SILENCE FELL UPON US SUDDENLY
3070-166420-0034 VALLEY'S WESTERN GATE THE WHOLE VALE SWIFTLY DARKENED A FLOOD OF CRYSTAL CLEAR SHADOWS POURED WITHIN IT IT WAS THE PRELUDE TO THAT MIRACLE OF UNEARTHLY BEAUTY SEEN NOWHERE ELSE ON THIS EARTH THE SUNSET OF TIBET
3070-166420-0035 WE TURNED EXPECTANT EYES TO THE WEST A LITTLE COOL BREEZE RACED DOWN FROM THE WATCHING STEEPS LIKE A MESSENGER WHISPERED TO THE NODDING POPPIES SIGHED AND WAS GONE THE POPPIES WERE STILL
3070-166420-0036 RANK UPON RANK OF THEM THRUSTING THEIR HEADS INTO THE PATH OF THE SETTING SUN THEY CHANGED FROM MOTTLED SILVER INTO FAINT ROSE DEEPENED TO CRIMSON THE DRAGONS OF THE SKY DRINK THE BLOOD OF THE SUNSET
3070-166420-0037 SAID CHIU MING AS THOUGH A GIGANTIC GLOBE OF CRYSTAL HAD DROPPED UPON THE HEAVENS THEIR BLUE TURNED SWIFTLY TO A CLEAR AND GLOWING AMBER THEN AS ABRUPTLY SHIFTED TO A LUMINOUS VIOLET
3070-166420-0038 A SOFT GREEN LIGHT PULSED THROUGH THE VALLEY UNDER IT
3070-166420-0039 BEGAN TO CREEP DOWNWARD TOWARD THE EASTERN HORIZON WHERE A NEBULOUS PULSING SPLENDOR AROSE TO MEET IT AND AS WE WATCHED I HEARD A GASP FROM DRAKE AND IT WAS ECHOED BY MY OWN
3070-166420-0040 FOR THE SIX BEAMS WERE SWAYING MOVING WITH EVER SWIFTER MOTION FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN EVER WIDENING SWEEP
3070-166420-0041 FASTER AND FASTER THE SIX HIGH FLUNG BEAMS SWAYED AND THEN BROKE BROKE AS THOUGH A GIGANTIC UNSEEN HAND HAD REACHED UP AND SNAPPED THEM AN INSTANT THE SEVERED ENDS RIBBONED AIMLESSLY THEN BENT
3070-166420-0042 TURNED DOWN AND DARTED EARTHWARD
3070-166420-0043 LIKE THREADS I SAW IT I STRUGGLED WITH BEWILDERMENT I SAW IT BUT I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE I ENDED MOST INADEQUATELY IT WAS PURPOSEFUL
3070-166420-0044 HE WHISPERED IT WAS DELIBERATE AS THOUGH SOMETHING REACHED UP JUGGLED WITH THE RAYS BROKE THEM AND DREW THEM DOWN LIKE WILLOW WITHES THE DEVILS THAT DWELL HERE QUAVERED CHIU MING
3070-166420-0045 SOME MAGNETIC PHENOMENON I WAS HALF ANGRY AT MYSELF FOR MY OWN TOUCH OF PANIC LIGHT CAN BE DEFLECTED BY PASSAGE THROUGH A MAGNETIC FIELD OF COURSE THAT'S IT CERTAINLY I DON'T KNOW
3070-166420-0046 DEVILS MUTTERED THE FRIGHTENED CHINESE WHAT'S THAT DRAKE GRIPPED MY ARM AND POINTED TO THE NORTH A DEEPER BLACKNESS HAD GROWN THERE WHILE WE HAD BEEN TALKING
3070-166420-0047 A POOL OF DARKNESS AGAINST WHICH THE MOUNTAIN SUMMITS STOOD OUT BLADE SHARP EDGES FAINTLY LUMINOUS A GIGANTIC LANCE OF MISTY GREEN FIRE DARTED FROM THE BLACKNESS AND THRUST ITS POINT INTO THE HEART OF THE ZENITH FOLLOWING IT
3070-166420-0048 AND NOW THE BLACKNESS WAS LIKE AN EBON HAND BRANDISHING A THOUSAND JAVELINS OF TINSELED FLAME
3070-166420-0049 I SAID IT OUGHT TO BE A GOOD ONE MUSED DRAKE GAZE INTENT UPON IT DID YOU NOTICE THE BIG SUN SPOT I SHOOK MY HEAD THE BIGGEST I EVER SAW
3070-166420-0050 SOME LITTLE AURORA LIGHTER THAT SPOT I TOLD YOU LOOK AT THAT HE CRIED THE GREEN LANCES HAD FALLEN BACK THE BLACKNESS GATHERED ITSELF TOGETHER THEN FROM IT BEGAN TO PULSE BILLOWS OF RADIANCE
3070-166420-0051 SPANGLED WITH INFINITE DARTING SWARMS OF FLASHING CORPUSCLES LIKE UNCOUNTED HOSTS OF DANCING FIREFLIES HIGHER THE WAVES ROLLED PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN AND IRIDESCENT VIOLET WEIRD COPPEROUS YELLOWS AND METALLIC SAFFRONS
3070-166420-0052 AND A SHIMMER OF GLITTERING ASH OF ROSE THEN WAVERED SPLIT AND FORMED INTO GIGANTIC SPARKLING MARCHING CURTAINS OF SPLENDOR A VAST CIRCLE OF LIGHT SPRANG OUT UPON THE FOLDS OF THE FLICKERING RUSHING CURTAINS
3070-166420-0053 TOWARD THE RING FROM EVERY SIDE RACED THE MAJESTIC FOLDS DREW THEMSELVES TOGETHER CIRCLED SEETHED AROUND IT LIKE FOAM OF FIRE ABOUT THE LIP OF A CAULDRON AND POURED THROUGH THE SHINING CIRCLE AS THOUGH IT WERE THE MOUTH OF THAT FABLED CAVERN
3070-166420-0054 INTO THE RING'S MOUTH THE AURORA FLEW CASCADING IN A COLUMNED STREAM TO EARTH THEN SWIFTLY
3070-166420-0055 BREATHED DRAKE FAR TO THE WEST A SOUND CAME TO US FIRST A WHISPER THEN A WILD RUSHING A PROLONGED WAILING A CRACKLING A GREAT LIGHT FLASHED THROUGH THE MIST GLOWED ABOUT US AND FADED AGAIN THE WAILING
