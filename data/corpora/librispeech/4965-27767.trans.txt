4965-27767-0000 IT WAS A BRILLIANT DAY A HUNDRED TINTS GLISTENED ON THE WHITE GROUND AND THE IRON BARS OF THE GARDEN RAILING
4965-27767-0001 GABRIEL ANDERSEN TURNED HIS STEPS TOWARD THE FRINGE OF BLUE LACE FOR A TRAMP IN THE WOODS ANOTHER SPRING IN MY LIFE HE SAID BREATHING DEEP AND PEERING UP AT THE HEAVENS THROUGH HIS SPECTACLES ANDERSEN WAS RATHER GIVEN TO SENTIMENTAL POETISING
4965-27767-0002 HE WALKED WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED BEHIND HIM DANGLING HIS CANE HE HAD GONE BUT A FEW PACES WHEN HE NOTICED A GROUP OF SOLDIERS AND HORSES ON THE ROAD BEYOND THE GARDEN RAIL THEIR DRAB UNIFORMS STOOD OUT DULLY AGAINST THE WHITE OF THE SNOW
4965-27767-0003 BUT THEIR SWORDS AND HORSES COATS TOSSED BACK THE LIGHT THEIR BOWED CAVALRY LEGS MOVED AWKWARDLY ON THE SNOW ANDERSEN WONDERED WHAT THEY WERE DOING THERE SUDDENLY THE NATURE OF THEIR BUSINESS FLASHED UPON HIM IT WAS AN UGLY ERRAND THEY WERE UPON
4965-27767-0004 AN INSTINCT RATHER THAT HIS REASON TOLD HIM
4965-27767-0005 AND THE SAME INSTINCT TOLD HIM HE MUST CONCEAL HIMSELF FROM THE SOLDIERS HE TURNED TO THE LEFT QUICKLY DROPPED ON HIS KNEES AND CRAWLED ON THE SOFT THAWING CRACKLING SNOW TO A LOW HAYSTACK FROM BEHIND WHICH BY CRANING HIS NECK HE COULD WATCH WHAT THE SOLDIERS WERE DOING
4965-27767-0006 THERE WERE TWELVE OF THEM ONE A STOCKY YOUNG OFFICER IN A GREY CLOAK CAUGHT IN PRETTILY AT THE WAIST BY A SILVER BELT HIS FACE WAS SO RED THAT EVEN AT THAT DISTANCE ANDERSEN CAUGHT THE ODD WHITISH GLEAM OF HIS LIGHT
4965-27767-0007 THE BROKEN TONES OF HIS RAUCOUS VOICE REACHED DISTINCTLY TO WHERE THE TEACHER LISTENING INTENTLY LAY HIDDEN I KNOW WHAT I AM ABOUT I DON'T NEED ANYBODY'S ADVICE THE OFFICER CRIED
4965-27767-0008 HE CLAPPED HIS ARMS AKIMBO AND LOOKED DOWN AT SOME ONE AMONG THE GROUP OF BUSTLING SOLDIERS I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO BE A REBEL YOU DAMNED SKUNK ANDERSEN'S HEART BEAT FAST GOOD HEAVENS HE THOUGHT IS IT POSSIBLE HIS HEAD GREW CHILL AS IF STRUCK BY A COLD WAVE
4965-27767-0009 OFFICER A QUIET RESTRAINED YET DISTINCT VOICE CAME FROM AMONG THE SOLDIERS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT IT'S FOR THE COURT TO DECIDE YOU AREN'T A JUDGE IT'S PLAIN MURDER NOT SILENCE THUNDERED THE OFFICER HIS VOICE CHOKING WITH RAGE I'LL GIVE YOU A COURT
4965-27767-0010 HE PUT THE SPURS TO HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY GABRIEL ANDERSEN MECHANICALLY OBSERVED HOW CAREFULLY THE HORSE PICKED ITS WAY PLACING ITS FEET DAINTILY AS IF FOR THE STEPS OF A MINUET ITS EARS WERE PRICKED TO CATCH EVERY SOUND
4965-27767-0011 THERE WAS MOMENTARY BUSTLE AND EXCITEMENT AMONG THE SOLDIERS THEN THEY DISPERSED IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS LEAVING THREE PERSONS IN BLACK BEHIND TWO TALL MEN AND ONE VERY SHORT AND FRAIL ANDERSEN COULD SEE THE HAIR OF THE SHORT ONE'S HEAD
4965-27767-0012 IT WAS VERY LIGHT AND HE SAW HIS ROSY EARS STICKING OUT ON EACH SIDE NOW HE FULLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS TO HAPPEN BUT IT WAS A THING SO OUT OF THE ORDINARY SO HORRIBLE THAT HE FANCIED HE WAS DREAMING
4965-27767-0013 IT'S SO BRIGHT SO BEAUTIFUL THE SNOW THE FIELD THE WOODS THE SKY THE BREATH OF SPRING IS UPON EVERYTHING YET PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE KILLED HOW CAN IT BE IMPOSSIBLE SO HIS THOUGHTS RAN IN CONFUSION
4965-27767-0014 HE HAD THE SENSATION OF A MAN SUDDENLY GONE INSANE WHO FINDS HE SEES HEARS AND FEELS WHAT HE IS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO AND OUGHT NOT HEAR SEE AND FEEL THE THREE MEN IN BLACK STOOD NEXT TO ONE ANOTHER HARD BY THE RAILING
4965-27767-0015 TWO QUITE CLOSE TOGETHER THE SHORT ONE SOME DISTANCE AWAY OFFICER ONE OF THEM CRIED IN A DESPERATE VOICE ANDERSEN COULD NOT SEE WHICH IT WAS GOD SEES US OFFICER EIGHT SOLDIERS DISMOUNTED QUICKLY
4965-27767-0016 THEIR SPURS AND SABRES CATCHING AWKWARDLY EVIDENTLY THEY WERE IN A HURRY AS IF DOING A THIEF'S JOB SEVERAL SECONDS PASSED IN SILENCE UNTIL THE SOLDIERS PLACED THEMSELVES IN A ROW A FEW FEET FROM THE BLACK FIGURES AND LEVELLED THEIR GUNS
4965-27767-0017 IN DOING SO ONE SOLDIER KNOCKED HIS CAP FROM HIS HEAD HE PICKED IT UP AND PUT IT ON AGAIN WITHOUT BRUSHING OFF THE WET SNOW THE OFFICER'S MOUNT STILL KEPT DANCING ON ONE SPOT WITH HIS EARS PRICKED WHILE THE OTHER HORSES ALSO WITH SHARP EARS ERECT TO CATCH EVERY SOUND
4965-27767-0018 STOOD MOTIONLESS LOOKING AT THE MEN IN BLACK THEIR LONG WISE HEADS INCLINED TO ONE SIDE SPARE THE BOY AT LEAST ANOTHER VOICE SUDDENLY PIERCED THE AIR WHY KILL A CHILD DAMN YOU WHAT HAS THE CHILD DONE
4965-27767-0019 THUNDERED THE OFFICER DROWNING THE OTHER VOICE HIS FACE TURNED AS SCARLET AS A PIECE OF RED FLANNEL THERE FOLLOWED A SCENE SAVAGE AND REPULSIVE IN ITS GRUESOMENESS THE SHORT FIGURE IN BLACK WITH THE LIGHT HAIR AND THE ROSY EARS
4965-27767-0020 UTTERED A WILD SHRIEK IN A SHRILL CHILD'S TONES AND REELED TO ONE SIDE INSTANTLY IT WAS CAUGHT UP BY TWO OR THREE SOLDIERS BUT THE BOY BEGAN TO STRUGGLE AND TWO MORE SOLDIERS RAN UP OW OW OW OW THE BOY CRIED
4965-27767-0021 LET ME GO LET ME GO OW OW HIS SHRILL VOICE CUT THE AIR LIKE THE YELL OF A STUCK PORKLING NOT QUITE DONE TO DEATH SUDDENLY HE GREW QUIET SOME ONE MUST HAVE STRUCK HIM AN UNEXPECTED OPPRESSIVE SILENCE ENSUED
4965-27767-0022 THE BOY WAS BEING PUSHED FORWARD THEN THERE CAME A DEAFENING REPORT ANDERSEN STARTED BACK ALL IN A TREMBLE HE SAW DISTINCTLY YET VAGUELY AS IN A DREAM THE DROPPING OF TWO DARK BODIES THE FLASH OF PALE SPARKS
4965-27767-0023 AND A LIGHT SMOKE RISING IN THE CLEAN BRIGHT ATMOSPHERE HE SAW THE SOLDIERS HASTILY MOUNTING THEIR HORSES WITHOUT EVEN GLANCING AT THE BODIES HE SAW THEM GALLOPING ALONG THE MUDDY ROAD THEIR ARMS CLANKING THEIR HORSES HOOFS CLATTERING HE SAW ALL THIS
4965-27767-0024 HIMSELF NOW STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD NOT KNOWING WHEN AND WHY HE HAD JUMPED FROM BEHIND THE HAYSTACK HE WAS DEATHLY PALE HIS FACE WAS COVERED WITH DANK SWEAT HIS BODY WAS AQUIVER A PHYSICAL SADNESS SMOTE AND TORTURED HIM
4965-27767-0025 HE COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE NATURE OF THE FEELING IT WAS AKIN TO EXTREME SICKNESS THOUGH FAR MORE NAUSEATING AND TERRIBLE AFTER THE SOLDIERS HAD DISAPPEARED BEYOND THE BEND TOWARD THE WOODS PEOPLE CAME HURRYING TO THE SPOT OF THE SHOOTING
4965-27767-0026 THOUGH TILL THEN NOT A SOUL HAD BEEN IN SIGHT THE BODIES LAY AT THE ROADSIDE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RAILING WHERE THE SNOW WAS CLEAN BRITTLE AND UNTRAMPLED AND GLISTENED CHEERFULLY IN THE BRIGHT ATMOSPHERE THERE WERE THREE DEAD BODIES TWO MEN AND A BOY
4965-27767-0027 THE BOY LAY WITH HIS LONG SOFT NECK STRETCHED ON THE SNOW THE FACE OF THE MAN NEXT TO THE BOY WAS INVISIBLE HE HAD FALLEN FACE DOWNWARD IN A POOL OF BLOOD THE THIRD WAS A BIG MAN WITH A BLACK BEARD AND HUGE MUSCULAR ARMS
4965-27767-0028 HE LAY STRETCHED OUT TO THE FULL LENGTH OF HIS BIG BODY HIS ARMS EXTENDED OVER A LARGE AREA OF BLOOD STAINED SNOW THE THREE MEN WHO HAD BEEN SHOT LAY BLACK AGAINST THE WHITE SNOW MOTIONLESS
4965-27767-0029 FROM AFAR NO ONE COULD HAVE TOLD THE TERROR THAT WAS IN THEIR IMMOBILITY AS THEY LAY THERE AT THE EDGE OF THE NARROW ROAD CROWDED WITH PEOPLE THAT NIGHT GABRIEL ANDERSEN IN HIS LITTLE ROOM IN THE SCHOOLHOUSE DID NOT WRITE POEMS AS USUAL
4965-27767-0030 HE STOOD AT THE WINDOW AND LOOKED AT THE DISTANT PALE DISK OF THE MOON IN THE MISTY BLUE SKY AND THOUGHT AND HIS THOUGHTS WERE CONFUSED GLOOMY AND HEAVY AS IF A CLOUD HAD DESCENDED UPON HIS BRAIN INDISTINCTLY OUTLINED IN THE DULL MOONLIGHT
4965-27767-0031 HE SAW THE DARK RAILING THE TREES THE EMPTY GARDEN IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE BEHELD THEM
4965-27767-0032 LOOKING AT THE FAR OFF COLD MOON WITH THEIR DEAD WHITE EYES AS HE WITH HIS LIVING EYES THE TIME WILL COME SOME DAY HE THOUGHT WHEN THE KILLING OF PEOPLE BY OTHERS WILL BE AN UTTER IMPOSSIBILITY
4965-27767-0033 THE TIME WILL COME WHEN EVEN THE SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS WHO KILLED THESE THREE MEN WILL REALISE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AND WILL UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT THEY KILLED THEM FOR IS JUST AS NECESSARY IMPORTANT AND DEAR TO THEM TO THE OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS AS TO THOSE WHOM THEY KILLED
4965-27767-0034 YES HE SAID ALOUD AND SOLEMNLY HIS EYES MOISTENING THAT TIME WILL COME THEY WILL UNDERSTAND AND THE PALE DISK OF THE MOON WAS BLOTTED OUT BY THE MOISTURE IN HIS EYES
4965-27767-0035 A LARGE PITY PIERCED HIS HEART FOR THE THREE VICTIMS WHOSE EYES LOOKED AT THE MOON SAD AND UNSEEING A FEELING OF RAGE CUT HIM AS WITH A SHARP KNIFE AND TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM BUT GABRIEL ANDERSEN QUIETED HIS HEART
4965-27767-0036 WHISPERING SOFTLY THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO AND THIS OLD AND READY PHRASE GAVE HIM THE STRENGTH TO STIFLE HIS RAGE AND INDIGNATION TWO
4965-27767-0037 THE DAY WAS AS BRIGHT AND WHITE BUT THE SPRING WAS ALREADY ADVANCED THE WET SOIL SMELT OF SPRING CLEAR COLD WATER RAN EVERYWHERE FROM UNDER THE LOOSE THAWING SNOW THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES WERE SPRINGY AND ELASTIC
4965-27767-0038 YET THE CLEARNESS AND THE JOY OF THE SPRING DAY WERE NOT IN THE VILLAGE THEY WERE SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE WHERE THERE WERE NO PEOPLE IN THE FIELDS THE WOODS AND THE MOUNTAINS IN THE VILLAGE THE AIR WAS STIFLING HEAVY AND TERRIBLE AS IN A NIGHTMARE
4965-27767-0039 GABRIEL ANDERSEN STOOD IN THE ROAD NEAR A CROWD OF DARK SAD ABSENT MINDED PEOPLE AND CRANED HIS NECK TO SEE THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE FLOGGING OF SEVEN PEASANTS THEY STOOD IN THE THAWING SNOW
4965-27767-0040 AND GABRIEL ANDERSEN COULD NOT PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT THEY WERE PEOPLE WHOM HE HAD LONG KNOWN AND UNDERSTOOD BY THAT WHICH WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO THEM
4965-27767-0041 THEY WERE SEPARATED FROM ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD AND SO WERE UNABLE TO FEEL WHAT HE GABRIEL ANDERSEN FELT JUST AS HE WAS UNABLE TO FEEL WHAT THEY FELT ROUND THEM WERE THE SOLDIERS CONFIDENTLY AND BEAUTIFULLY MOUNTED ON HIGH UPON THEIR LARGE STEEDS
4965-27767-0042 WHO TOSSED THEIR WISE HEADS AND TURNED THEIR DAPPLED WOODEN FACES SLOWLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE LOOKING CONTEMPTUOUSLY AT HIM GABRIEL ANDERSEN WHO WAS SOON TO BEHOLD THIS HORROR THIS DISGRACE AND WOULD DO NOTHING WOULD NOT DARE TO DO ANYTHING
4965-27767-0043 SO IT SEEMED TO GABRIEL ANDERSEN
4965-27767-0044 THEY TOOK THE FIRST PEASANT GABRIEL ANDERSEN SAW HIS STRANGE IMPLORING HOPELESS LOOK HIS LIPS MOVED BUT NO SOUND WAS HEARD AND HIS EYES WANDERED THERE WAS A BRIGHT GLEAM IN THEM AS IN THE EYES OF A MADMAN
4965-27767-0045 HIS MIND IT WAS EVIDENT WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO COMPREHEND WHAT WAS HAPPENING
4965-27767-0046 THE LARGE RED FACED SOLDIER IN A RED CAP PUSHED TOWARD HIM LOOKED DOWN AT HIS BODY WITH SEEMING DELIGHT AND THEN CRIED IN A CLEAR VOICE WELL LET HER GO WITH GOD'S BLESSING ANDERSEN SEEMED NOT TO SEE THE SOLDIERS THE SKY THE HORSES OR THE CROWD
4965-27767-0047 HE DID NOT FEEL THE COLD THE TERROR OR THE SHAME HE DID NOT HEAR THE SWISH OF THE KNOUT IN THE AIR OR THE SAVAGE HOWL OF PAIN AND DESPAIR HE ONLY SAW THE BARE BACK OF A MAN'S BODY SWELLING UP AND COVERED OVER EVENLY WITH
4965-27767-0048 WHITE AND PURPLE STRIPES GRADUALLY THE BARE BACK LOST THE SEMBLANCE OF HUMAN FLESH THE BLOOD OOZED AND SQUIRTED FORMING PATCHES DROPS AND RIVULETS WHICH RAN DOWN ON THE WHITE THAWING SNOW
4965-27767-0049 TERROR GRIPPED THE SOUL OF GABRIEL ANDERSEN AS HE THOUGHT OF THE MOMENT WHEN THE MAN WOULD RISE AND FACE ALL THE PEOPLE
4965-27767-0050 AND REDUCED TO A BLOODY PULP HE CLOSED HIS EYES WHEN HE OPENED THEM HE SAW FOUR SOLDIERS IN UNIFORM AND RED HATS FORCING ANOTHER MAN DOWN ON THE SNOW HIS BACK BARED JUST AS SHAMEFULLY TERRIBLY AND ABSURDLY A LUDICROUSLY TRAGIC SIGHT
4965-27767-0051 THEN CAME THE THIRD THE FOURTH AND SO ON TO THE END AND GABRIEL ANDERSEN STOOD ON THE WET THAWING SNOW CRANING HIS NECK TREMBLING AND STUTTERING THOUGH HE DID NOT SAY A WORD DANK SWEAT POURED FROM HIS BODY
4965-27767-0052 A SENSE OF SHAME PERMEATED HIS WHOLE BEING IT WAS A HUMILIATING FEELING HAVING TO ESCAPE BEING NOTICED SO THAT THEY SHOULD NOT CATCH HIM AND LAY HIM THERE ON THE SNOW AND STRIP HIM BARE HIM GABRIEL ANDERSEN THE SOLDIERS PRESSED AND CROWDED
4965-27767-0053 THE HORSES TOSSED THEIR HEADS THE KNOUT SWISHED IN THE AIR AND THE BARE SHAMED HUMAN FLESH SWELLED UP TORE RAN OVER WITH BLOOD AND CURLED LIKE A SNAKE OATHS WILD SHRIEKS RAINED UPON THE VILLAGE THROUGH THE CLEAN WHITE AIR OF THAT SPRING DAY
4965-27767-0054 ANDERSEN NOW SAW FIVE MEN'S FACES AT THE STEPS OF THE TOWN HALL THE FACES OF THOSE MEN WHO HAD ALREADY UNDERGONE THEIR SHAME HE QUICKLY TURNED HIS EYES AWAY AFTER SEEING THIS A MAN MUST DIE HE THOUGHT
4965-27767-0055 THREE THERE WERE SEVENTEEN OF THEM FIFTEEN SOLDIERS A SUBALTERN AND A YOUNG BEARDLESS OFFICER THE OFFICER LAY IN FRONT OF THE FIRE LOOKING INTENTLY INTO THE FLAMES
4965-27767-0056 AND OCCASIONALLY STUMBLED ACROSS THE LOGS STICKING OUT FROM THE BLAZING FIRE GABRIEL ANDERSEN WEARING AN OVERCOAT AND CARRYING HIS CANE BEHIND HIS BACK APPROACHED THEM THE SUBALTERN A STOUT FELLOW WITH A MOUSTACHE
4965-27767-0057 WHO ARE YOU WHAT DO YOU WANT HE ASKED EXCITEDLY FROM HIS TONE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE SOLDIERS FEARED EVERYBODY IN THAT DISTRICT
4965-27767-0058 OFFICER HE SAID THERE IS A MAN HERE I DON'T KNOW THE OFFICER LOOKED AT ANDERSEN WITHOUT SPEAKING OFFICER SAID ANDERSEN IN A THIN STRAINED VOICE MY NAME IS MICHELSON
4965-27767-0059 I AM A BUSINESS MAN HERE AND I AM GOING TO THE VILLAGE ON BUSINESS I WAS AFRAID I MIGHT BE MISTAKEN FOR SOME ONE ELSE YOU KNOW THEN WHAT ARE YOU NOSING ABOUT HERE FOR THE OFFICER SAID ANGRILY AND TURNED AWAY A BUSINESS MAN SNEERED A SOLDIER
4965-27767-0060 HE OUGHT TO BE SEARCHED THIS BUSINESS MAN OUGHT SO AS NOT TO BE KNOCKING ABOUT AT NIGHT A GOOD ONE IN THE JAW IS WHAT HE NEEDS HE'S A SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER OFFICER SAID THE SUBALTERN DON'T YOU THINK WE'D BETTER ARREST HIM WHAT DON'T
4965-27767-0061 I'M SICK OF THEM DAMN EM GABRIEL ANDERSEN STOOD THERE WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING HIS EYES FLASHED STRANGELY IN THE DARK BY THE FIRELIGHT AND IT WAS STRANGE TO SEE HIS SHORT SUBSTANTIAL CLEAN NEAT FIGURE IN THE FIELD AT NIGHT AMONG THE SOLDIERS
4965-27767-0062 WITH HIS OVERCOAT AND CANE AND GLASSES GLISTENING IN THE FIRELIGHT THE SOLDIERS LEFT HIM AND WALKED AWAY GABRIEL ANDERSEN REMAINED STANDING FOR A WHILE THEN HE TURNED AND LEFT RAPIDLY DISAPPEARING IN THE DARKNESS
4965-27767-0063 THE NIGHT WAS DRAWING TO A CLOSE THE AIR TURNED CHILLY AND THE TOPS OF THE BUSHES DEFINED THEMSELVES MORE CLEARLY IN THE DARK GABRIEL ANDERSEN WENT AGAIN TO THE MILITARY POST BUT THIS TIME HE HID
4965-27767-0064 CROUCHING LOW AS HE MADE HIS WAY UNDER THE COVER OF THE BUSHES BEHIND HIM PEOPLE MOVED ABOUT QUIETLY AND CAREFULLY BENDING THE BUSHES SILENT AS SHADOWS NEXT TO GABRIEL ON HIS RIGHT WALKED A TALL MAN WITH A REVOLVER IN HIS HAND
4965-27767-0065 THE FIGURE OF A SOLDIER ON THE HILL OUTLINED ITSELF STRANGELY UNEXPECTEDLY NOT WHERE THEY HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR IT IT WAS FAINTLY ILLUMINED
4965-27767-0066 GABRIEL ANDERSEN RECOGNISED THE SOLDIER IT WAS THE ONE WHO HAD PROPOSED THAT HE SHOULD BE SEARCHED NOTHING STIRRED IN ANDERSEN'S HEART HIS FACE WAS COLD AND MOTIONLESS AS OF A MAN WHO IS ASLEEP ROUND THE FIRE THE SOLDIERS LAY STRETCHED OUT SLEEPING
4965-27767-0067 ALL EXCEPT THE SUBALTERN WHO SAT WITH HIS HEAD DROOPING OVER HIS KNEES THE TALL THIN MAN ON ANDERSEN'S RIGHT RAISED THE REVOLVER AND PULLED THE TRIGGER A MOMENTARY BLINDING FLASH A DEAFENING REPORT
4965-27767-0068 ANDERSEN SAW THE GUARD LIFT HIS HANDS AND THEN SIT DOWN ON THE GROUND CLASPING HIS BOSOM FROM ALL DIRECTIONS SHORT CRACKLING SPARKS FLASHED UP WHICH COMBINED INTO ONE RIVING ROAR THE SUBALTERN JUMPED UP AND DROPPED STRAIGHT INTO THE FIRE
4965-27767-0069 GREY SOLDIERS FIGURES MOVED ABOUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS LIKE APPARITIONS THROWING UP THEIR HANDS AND FALLING AND WRITHING ON THE BLACK EARTH THE YOUNG OFFICER RAN PAST ANDERSEN FLUTTERING HIS HANDS LIKE SOME STRANGE FRIGHTENED BIRD ANDERSEN
4965-27767-0070 AS IF HE WERE THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE RAISED HIS CANE WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH HE HIT THE OFFICER ON THE HEAD EACH BLOW DESCENDING WITH A DULL UGLY THUD THE OFFICER REELED IN A CIRCLE STRUCK A BUSH AND SAT DOWN AFTER THE SECOND BLOW
4965-27767-0071 THE OFFICER SANK TOGETHER IN A HEAP AND LUNGED WITH GREAT FORCE HEAD FOREMOST ON THE GROUND HIS LEGS TWITCHED FOR A WHILE THEN HE CURLED UP QUIETLY THE SHOTS CEASED BLACK MEN WITH WHITE FACES
4965-27767-0072 GHOSTLY GREY IN THE DARK MOVED ABOUT THE DEAD BODIES OF THE SOLDIERS TAKING AWAY THEIR ARMS AND AMMUNITION ANDERSEN WATCHED ALL THIS WITH A COLD ATTENTIVE STARE WHEN ALL WAS OVER HE WENT UP
4965-27767-0073 TOOK HOLD OF THE BURNED SUBALTERN'S LEGS AND TRIED TO REMOVE THE BODY FROM THE FIRE BUT IT WAS TOO HEAVY FOR HIM AND HE LET IT GO
4965-27767-0074 HE THOUGHT OF HOW HE GABRIEL ANDERSEN WITH HIS SPECTACLES CANE OVERCOAT AND POEMS HAD LIED AND BETRAYED FIFTEEN MEN HE THOUGHT IT WAS TERRIBLE YET THERE WAS NEITHER PITY SHAME NOR REGRET IN HIS HEART WERE HE TO BE SET FREE
4965-27767-0075 HE KNEW THAT HE GABRIEL ANDERSEN WITH THE SPECTACLES AND POEMS WOULD GO STRAIGHTWAY AND DO IT AGAIN HE TRIED TO EXAMINE HIMSELF TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE HIS SOUL BUT HIS THOUGHTS WERE HEAVY AND CONFUSED
4965-27767-0076 FOR SOME REASON IT WAS MORE PAINFUL FOR HIM TO THINK OF THE THREE MEN LYING ON THE SNOW LOOKING AT THE PALE DISK OF THE FAR OFF MOON WITH THEIR DEAD UNSEEING EYES THAN OF THE MURDERED OFFICER WHOM HE HAD STRUCK TWO DRY UGLY BLOWS ON THE HEAD
4965-27767-0077 OF HIS OWN DEATH HE DID NOT THINK IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD DONE WITH EVERYTHING LONG LONG AGO SOMETHING HAD DIED HAD GONE OUT AND LEFT HIM EMPTY AND HE MUST NOT THINK ABOUT IT
4965-27767-0078 AND WHEN THEY GRABBED HIM BY THE SHOULDER AND HE ROSE AND THEY QUICKLY LED HIM THROUGH THE GARDEN WHERE THE CABBAGES RAISED THEIR DRY HEADS HE COULD NOT FORMULATE A SINGLE THOUGHT HE WAS CONDUCTED TO THE ROAD AND PLACED AT THE RAILING WITH HIS BACK TO ONE OF THE IRON BARS
4965-27767-0079 HE FIXED HIS SPECTACLES PUT HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM AND STOOD THERE WITH HIS NEAT STOCKY BODY HIS HEAD SLIGHTLY INCLINED TO ONE SIDE
4965-27767-0080 CHEST AND STOMACH AND PALE FACES WITH TREMBLING LIPS HE DISTINCTLY SAW HOW ONE BARREL LEVELLED AT HIS FOREHEAD SUDDENLY DROPPED SOMETHING STRANGE AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE AS IF NO LONGER OF THIS WORLD NO LONGER EARTHLY
4965-27767-0081 PASSED THROUGH ANDERSEN'S MIND HE STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF TO THE FULL HEIGHT OF HIS SHORT BODY AND THREW BACK HIS HEAD IN SIMPLE PRIDE A STRANGE INDISTINCT SENSE OF CLEANNESS STRENGTH AND PRIDE FILLED HIS SOUL AND EVERYTHING
4965-27767-0082 THE SUN AND THE SKY AND THE PEOPLE AND THE FIELD AND DEATH SEEMED TO HIM INSIGNIFICANT REMOTE AND USELESS THE BULLETS HIT HIM IN THE CHEST IN THE LEFT EYE IN THE STOMACH WENT THROUGH HIS CLEAN COAT BUTTONED ALL THE WAY UP
4965-27767-0083 HIS GLASSES SHIVERED INTO BITS HE UTTERED A SHRIEK CIRCLED ROUND AND FELL WITH HIS FACE AGAINST ONE OF THE IRON BARS
4965-27767-0084 HE CLAWED THE GROUND WITH HIS OUTSTRETCHED HANDS AS IF TRYING TO SUPPORT HIMSELF THE OFFICER WHO HAD TURNED GREEN RUSHED TOWARD HIM AND SENSELESSLY THRUST THE REVOLVER AGAINST HIS NECK AND FIRED TWICE ANDERSEN STRETCHED OUT ON THE GROUND
