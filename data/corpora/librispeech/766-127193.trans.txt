766-127193-0000 I WHISPERED FOR THE CURATE SEVERAL TIMES AND AT LAST FELT MY WAY TO THE DOOR OF THE KITCHEN IT WAS STILL DAYLIGHT AND I PERCEIVED HIM ACROSS THE ROOM LYING AGAINST THE TRIANGULAR HOLE THAT LOOKED OUT UPON THE MARTIANS
766-127193-0001 THROUGH THE APERTURE IN THE WALL I COULD SEE THE TOP OF A TREE TOUCHED WITH GOLD AND THE WARM BLUE OF A TRANQUIL EVENING SKY FOR A MINUTE OR SO I REMAINED WATCHING THE CURATE AND THEN I ADVANCED CROUCHING AND STEPPING WITH EXTREME CARE AMID THE BROKEN CROCKERY
766-127193-0002 THAT LITTERED THE FLOOR I TOUCHED THE CURATE'S LEG AND HE STARTED SO VIOLENTLY THAT A MASS OF PLASTER WENT SLIDING DOWN OUTSIDE AND FELL WITH A LOUD IMPACT I GRIPPED HIS ARM FEARING HE MIGHT CRY OUT AND FOR A LONG TIME WE CROUCHED MOTIONLESS
766-127193-0003 THEN I TURNED TO SEE HOW MUCH OF OUR RAMPART REMAINED THE DETACHMENT OF THE PLASTER HAD LEFT A VERTICAL SLIT OPEN IN THE DEBRIS AND BY RAISING MYSELF CAUTIOUSLY ACROSS A BEAM I WAS ABLE TO SEE OUT OF THIS GAP INTO WHAT HAD BEEN OVERNIGHT A QUIET SUBURBAN ROADWAY
766-127193-0004 THE BUILDING HAD VANISHED COMPLETELY SMASHED PULVERISED AND DISPERSED BY THE BLOW THE CYLINDER LAY NOW FAR BENEATH THE ORIGINAL FOUNDATIONS DEEP IN A HOLE ALREADY VASTLY LARGER THAN THE PIT I HAD LOOKED INTO AT WOKING
766-127193-0005 THE EARTH ALL ROUND IT HAD SPLASHED UNDER THAT TREMENDOUS IMPACT SPLASHED IS THE ONLY WORD AND LAY IN HEAPED PILES THAT HID THE MASSES OF THE ADJACENT HOUSES IT HAD BEHAVED EXACTLY LIKE MUD UNDER THE VIOLENT BLOW OF A HAMMER OUR HOUSE HAD COLLAPSED BACKWARD
766-127193-0006 THE FRONT PORTION EVEN ON THE GROUND FLOOR HAD BEEN DESTROYED COMPLETELY BY A CHANCE THE KITCHEN AND SCULLERY HAD ESCAPED AND STOOD BURIED NOW UNDER SOIL AND RUINS CLOSED IN BY TONS OF EARTH ON EVERY SIDE SAVE TOWARDS THE CYLINDER
766-127193-0007 OVER THAT ASPECT WE HUNG NOW ON THE VERY EDGE OF THE GREAT CIRCULAR PIT THE MARTIANS WERE ENGAGED IN MAKING THE HEAVY BEATING SOUND WAS EVIDENTLY JUST BEHIND US AND EVER AND AGAIN A BRIGHT GREEN VAPOUR DROVE UP LIKE A VEIL ACROSS OUR PEEPHOLE
766-127193-0008 THE CYLINDER WAS ALREADY OPENED IN THE CENTRE OF THE PIT AND ON THE FARTHER EDGE OF THE PIT AMID THE SMASHED AND GRAVEL HEAPED SHRUBBERY ONE OF THE GREAT FIGHTING MACHINES DESERTED BY ITS OCCUPANT STOOD STIFF AND TALL AGAINST THE EVENING SKY
766-127193-0009 AT FIRST I SCARCELY NOTICED THE PIT AND THE CYLINDER
766-127193-0010 ON ACCOUNT OF THE EXTRAORDINARY GLITTERING MECHANISM I SAW BUSY IN THE EXCAVATION
766-127193-0011 AND PAINFULLY ACROSS THE HEAPED MOULD NEAR IT THE MECHANISM IT CERTAINLY WAS THAT HELD MY ATTENTION FIRST IT WAS ONE OF THOSE COMPLICATED FABRICS
766-127193-0012 AND THE STUDY OF WHICH HAS ALREADY GIVEN SUCH AN ENORMOUS IMPETUS TO TERRESTRIAL INVENTION AS IT DAWNED UPON ME FIRST IT PRESENTED A SORT OF METALLIC SPIDER WITH FIVE JOINTED AGILE LEGS
766-127193-0013 AND WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF JOINTED LEVERS BARS AND REACHING AND CLUTCHING TENTACLES ABOUT ITS BODY MOST OF ITS ARMS WERE RETRACTED BUT WITH THREE LONG TENTACLES IT WAS FISHING OUT A NUMBER OF RODS PLATES AND BARS WHICH LINED THE COVERING AND APPARENTLY STRENGTHENED THE WALLS OF THE CYLINDER
766-127193-0014 ITS MOTION WAS SO SWIFT COMPLEX AND PERFECT THAT AT FIRST I DID NOT SEE IT AS A MACHINE IN SPITE OF ITS METALLIC GLITTER THE FIGHTING MACHINES WERE COORDINATED AND ANIMATED TO AN EXTRAORDINARY PITCH BUT NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH THIS
766-127193-0015 PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN THESE STRUCTURES AND HAVE ONLY THE ILL IMAGINED EFFORTS OF ARTISTS OR THE IMPERFECT DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH EYE WITNESSES AS MYSELF TO GO UPON SCARCELY REALISE THAT LIVING QUALITY I RECALL PARTICULARLY THE ILLUSTRATION
766-127193-0016 OF ONE OF THE FIRST PAMPHLETS TO GIVE A CONSECUTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE WAR THE ARTIST HAD EVIDENTLY MADE A HASTY STUDY OF ONE OF THE FIGHTING MACHINES AND THERE HIS KNOWLEDGE ENDED HE PRESENTED THEM AS TILTED STIFF TRIPODS WITHOUT EITHER FLEXIBILITY OR SUBTLETY
766-127193-0017 AND WITH AN ALTOGETHER MISLEADING MONOTONY OF EFFECT THE PAMPHLET CONTAINING THESE RENDERINGS HAD A CONSIDERABLE VOGUE AND I MENTION THEM HERE SIMPLY TO WARN THE READER AGAINST THE IMPRESSION THEY MAY HAVE CREATED THEY WERE NO MORE LIKE THE MARTIANS I SAW IN ACTION THAN A DUTCH DOLL IS LIKE A HUMAN BEING
766-127193-0018 TO MY MIND THE PAMPHLET WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER WITHOUT THEM AT FIRST I SAY THE HANDLING MACHINE DID NOT IMPRESS ME AS A MACHINE BUT AS A CRABLIKE CREATURE WITH A GLITTERING INTEGUMENT THE CONTROLLING MARTIAN WHOSE DELICATE TENTACLES ACTUATED ITS MOVEMENTS
766-127193-0019 SEEMING TO BE SIMPLY THE EQUIVALENT OF THE CRAB'S CEREBRAL PORTION BUT THEN I PERCEIVED THE RESEMBLANCE OF ITS GREY BROWN SHINY LEATHERY INTEGUMENT TO THAT OF THE OTHER SPRAWLING BODIES BEYOND AND THE TRUE NATURE OF THIS DEXTEROUS WORKMAN DAWNED UPON ME
766-127193-0020 WITH THAT REALISATION MY INTEREST SHIFTED TO THOSE OTHER CREATURES THE REAL MARTIANS
766-127193-0021 AND THE FIRST NAUSEA NO LONGER OBSCURED MY OBSERVATION MOREOVER I WAS CONCEALED AND MOTIONLESS AND UNDER NO URGENCY OF ACTION THEY WERE I NOW SAW THE MOST UNEARTHLY CREATURES IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE THEY WERE HUGE ROUND BODIES
766-127193-0022 OR RATHER HEADS ABOUT FOUR FEET IN DIAMETER EACH BODY HAVING IN FRONT OF IT A FACE THIS FACE HAD NO NOSTRILS
766-127193-0023 BUT IT HAD A PAIR OF VERY LARGE DARK COLOURED EYES AND JUST BENEATH THIS A KIND OF FLESHY BEAK IN THE BACK OF THIS HEAD OR BODY I SCARCELY KNOW HOW TO SPEAK OF IT WAS THE SINGLE TIGHT TYMPANIC SURFACE
766-127193-0024 SINCE KNOWN TO BE ANATOMICALLY AN EAR THOUGH IT MUST HAVE BEEN ALMOST USELESS
766-127193-0025 IN A GROUP ROUND THE MOUTH WERE SIXTEEN SLENDER ALMOST WHIPLIKE TENTACLES ARRANGED IN TWO BUNCHES OF EIGHT EACH THESE BUNCHES HAVE SINCE BEEN NAMED RATHER APTLY BY THAT DISTINGUISHED ANATOMIST PROFESSOR HOWES THE HANDS
766-127193-0026 EVEN AS I SAW THESE MARTIANS FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY SEEMED TO BE ENDEAVOURING TO RAISE THEMSELVES ON THESE HANDS BUT OF COURSE WITH THE INCREASED WEIGHT OF TERRESTRIAL CONDITIONS THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE THERE IS REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT ON MARS THEY MAY HAVE PROGRESSED UPON THEM WITH SOME FACILITY
766-127193-0027 THE INTERNAL ANATOMY I MAY REMARK HERE AS DISSECTION HAS SINCE SHOWN WAS ALMOST EQUALLY SIMPLE THE GREATER PART OF THE STRUCTURE WAS THE BRAIN
766-127193-0028 BESIDES THIS WERE THE BULKY LUNGS INTO WHICH THE MOUTH OPENED AND THE HEART AND ITS VESSELS THE PULMONARY DISTRESS CAUSED BY THE DENSER ATMOSPHERE AND GREATER GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION WAS ONLY TOO EVIDENT IN THE CONVULSIVE MOVEMENTS OF THE OUTER SKIN
766-127193-0029 AND THIS WAS THE SUM OF THE MARTIAN ORGANS STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM TO A HUMAN BEING ALL THE COMPLEX APPARATUS OF DIGESTION WHICH MAKES UP THE BULK OF OUR BODIES DID NOT EXIST IN THE MARTIANS THEY WERE HEADS MERELY HEADS ENTRAILS THEY HAD NONE
766-127193-0030 THEY DID NOT EAT MUCH LESS DIGEST INSTEAD THEY TOOK THE FRESH LIVING BLOOD OF OTHER CREATURES AND INJECTED IT INTO THEIR OWN VEINS I HAVE MYSELF SEEN THIS BEING DONE AS I SHALL MENTION IN ITS PLACE BUT
766-127193-0031 SQUEAMISH AS I MAY SEEM I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO DESCRIBE WHAT I COULD NOT ENDURE EVEN TO CONTINUE WATCHING LET IT SUFFICE TO SAY BLOOD OBTAINED FROM A STILL LIVING ANIMAL IN MOST CASES FROM A HUMAN BEING WAS RUN DIRECTLY BY MEANS OF A LITTLE PIPETTE
766-127193-0032 INTO THE RECIPIENT CANAL THE BARE IDEA OF THIS IS NO DOUBT HORRIBLY REPULSIVE TO US
766-127193-0033 TO AN INTELLIGENT RABBIT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES OF THE PRACTICE OF INJECTION ARE UNDENIABLE IF ONE THINKS OF THE TREMENDOUS WASTE OF HUMAN TIME AND ENERGY OCCASIONED BY EATING AND THE DIGESTIVE PROCESS
766-127193-0034 OUR BODIES ARE HALF MADE UP OF GLANDS AND TUBES AND ORGANS OCCUPIED IN TURNING HETEROGENEOUS FOOD INTO BLOOD THE DIGESTIVE PROCESSES AND THEIR REACTION UPON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM SAP OUR STRENGTH AND COLOUR OUR MINDS
766-127193-0035 MEN GO HAPPY OR MISERABLE AS THEY HAVE HEALTHY OR UNHEALTHY LIVERS OR SOUND GASTRIC GLANDS BUT THE MARTIANS WERE LIFTED ABOVE ALL THESE ORGANIC FLUCTUATIONS OF MOOD AND EMOTION THEIR UNDENIABLE PREFERENCE FOR MEN AS THEIR SOURCE OF NOURISHMENT
766-127193-0036 IS PARTLY EXPLAINED BY THE NATURE OF THE REMAINS OF THE VICTIMS THEY HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM AS PROVISIONS FROM MARS THESE CREATURES TO JUDGE FROM THE SHRIVELLED REMAINS THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO HUMAN HANDS WERE BIPEDS WITH FLIMSY SILICIOUS SKELETONS ALMOST LIKE THOSE OF THE SILICIOUS SPONGES
766-127193-0037 AND FEEBLE MUSCULATURE STANDING ABOUT SIX FEET HIGH AND HAVING ROUND ERECT HEADS AND LARGE EYES IN FLINTY SOCKETS TWO OR THREE OF THESE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN EACH CYLINDER AND ALL WERE KILLED BEFORE EARTH WAS REACHED IT WAS JUST AS WELL FOR THEM
766-127193-0038 FOR THE MERE ATTEMPT TO STAND UPRIGHT UPON OUR PLANET WOULD HAVE BROKEN EVERY BONE IN THEIR BODIES AND WHILE I AM ENGAGED IN THIS DESCRIPTION I MAY ADD IN THIS PLACE CERTAIN FURTHER DETAILS WHICH ALTHOUGH THEY WERE NOT ALL EVIDENT TO US AT THE TIME
766-127193-0039 WILL ENABLE THE READER WHO IS UNACQUAINTED WITH THEM TO FORM A CLEARER PICTURE OF THESE OFFENSIVE CREATURES IN THREE OTHER POINTS THEIR PHYSIOLOGY DIFFERED STRANGELY FROM OURS THEIR ORGANISMS DID NOT SLEEP ANY MORE THAN THE HEART OF MAN SLEEPS
766-127193-0040 SINCE THEY HAD NO EXTENSIVE MUSCULAR MECHANISM TO RECUPERATE THAT PERIODICAL EXTINCTION WAS UNKNOWN TO THEM THEY HAD LITTLE OR NO SENSE OF FATIGUE IT WOULD SEEM ON EARTH THEY COULD NEVER HAVE MOVED WITHOUT EFFORT YET EVEN TO THE LAST THEY KEPT IN ACTION
766-127193-0041 IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY DID TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF WORK AS EVEN ON EARTH IS PERHAPS THE CASE WITH THE ANTS IN THE NEXT PLACE WONDERFUL AS IT SEEMS IN A SEXUAL WORLD THE MARTIANS WERE ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT SEX
766-127193-0042 AND THEREFORE WITHOUT ANY OF THE TUMULTUOUS EMOTIONS THAT ARISE FROM THAT DIFFERENCE AMONG MEN A YOUNG MARTIAN THERE CAN NOW BE NO DISPUTE WAS REALLY BORN UPON EARTH DURING THE WAR AND IT WAS FOUND ATTACHED TO ITS PARENT PARTIALLY BUDDED OFF
766-127193-0043 JUST AS YOUNG LILYBULBS BUD OFF OR LIKE THE YOUNG ANIMALS IN THE FRESH WATER POLYP IN MAN IN ALL THE HIGHER TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS SUCH A METHOD OF INCREASE HAS DISAPPEARED BUT EVEN ON THIS EARTH IT WAS CERTAINLY THE PRIMITIVE METHOD
766-127193-0044 THE TUNICATES THE TWO PROCESSES OCCUR SIDE BY SIDE BUT FINALLY THE SEXUAL METHOD SUPERSEDED ITS COMPETITOR ALTOGETHER ON MARS HOWEVER JUST THE REVERSE HAS APPARENTLY BEEN THE CASE
766-127193-0045 WRITING LONG BEFORE THE MARTIAN INVASION DID FORECAST FOR MAN A FINAL STRUCTURE NOT UNLIKE THE ACTUAL MARTIAN CONDITION HIS PROPHECY I REMEMBER APPEARED IN NOVEMBER OR DECEMBER EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE
766-127193-0046 IN A LONG DEFUNCT PUBLICATION THE PALL MALL BUDGET AND I RECALL A CARICATURE OF IT IN A PRE MARTIAN PERIODICAL CALLED PUNCH HE POINTED OUT WRITING IN A FOOLISH FACETIOUS TONE
766-127193-0047 THAT THE PERFECTION OF MECHANICAL APPLIANCES MUST ULTIMATELY SUPERSEDE LIMBS THE PERFECTION OF CHEMICAL DEVICES DIGESTION THAT SUCH ORGANS AS HAIR EXTERNAL NOSE TEETH EARS AND CHIN WERE NO LONGER ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THE HUMAN BEING
766-127193-0048 AND THAT THE TENDENCY OF NATURAL SELECTION WOULD LIE IN THE DIRECTION OF THEIR STEADY DIMINUTION THROUGH THE COMING AGES THE BRAIN ALONE REMAINED A CARDINAL NECESSITY ONLY ONE OTHER PART OF THE BODY HAD A STRONG CASE FOR SURVIVAL AND THAT WAS THE HAND
766-127193-0049 TEACHER AND AGENT OF THE BRAIN WHILE THE REST OF THE BODY DWINDLED THE HANDS WOULD GROW LARGER THERE IS MANY A TRUE WORD WRITTEN IN JEST AND HERE IN THE MARTIANS WE HAVE BEYOND DISPUTE THE ACTUAL ACCOMPLISHMENT OF SUCH A SUPPRESSION
766-127193-0050 OF THE ANIMAL SIDE OF THE ORGANISM BY THE INTELLIGENCE TO ME IT IS QUITE CREDIBLE THAT THE MARTIANS MAY BE DESCENDED FROM BEINGS
766-127193-0051 THE LATTER GIVING RISE TO THE TWO BUNCHES OF DELICATE TENTACLES AT LAST AT THE EXPENSE OF THE REST OF THE BODY WITHOUT THE BODY THE BRAIN WOULD OF COURSE
766-127193-0052 WITHOUT ANY OF THE EMOTIONAL SUBSTRATUM OF THE HUMAN BEING THE LAST SALIENT POINT IN WHICH THE SYSTEMS OF THESE CREATURES DIFFERED FROM OURS
766-127193-0053 MICRO ORGANISMS WHICH CAUSE SO MUCH DISEASE AND PAIN ON EARTH HAVE EITHER NEVER APPEARED UPON MARS OR MARTIAN SANITARY SCIENCE ELIMINATED THEM AGES AGO A HUNDRED DISEASES ALL THE FEVERS AND CONTAGIONS OF HUMAN LIFE CONSUMPTION CANCERS TUMOURS
766-127193-0054 AND SUCH MORBIDITIES NEVER ENTER THE SCHEME OF THEIR LIFE AND SPEAKING OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE LIFE ON MARS AND TERRESTRIAL LIFE I MAY ALLUDE HERE TO THE CURIOUS SUGGESTIONS OF THE RED WEED
766-127193-0055 IS OF A VIVID BLOOD RED TINT AT ANY RATE THE SEEDS WHICH THE MARTIANS INTENTIONALLY OR ACCIDENTALLY BROUGHT WITH THEM GAVE RISE IN ALL CASES TO RED COLOURED GROWTHS ONLY THAT KNOWN POPULARLY AS THE RED WEED HOWEVER
766-127193-0056 THE RED CREEPER WAS QUITE A TRANSITORY GROWTH AND FEW PEOPLE HAVE SEEN IT GROWING FOR A TIME HOWEVER THE RED WEED GREW WITH ASTONISHING VIGOUR AND LUXURIANCE IT SPREAD UP THE SIDES OF THE PIT BY THE THIRD OR FOURTH DAY OF OUR IMPRISONMENT
766-127193-0057 AND ITS CACTUS LIKE BRANCHES FORMED A CARMINE FRINGE TO THE EDGES OF OUR TRIANGULAR WINDOW AND AFTERWARDS I FOUND IT BROADCAST THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND ESPECIALLY WHEREVER THERE WAS A STREAM OF WATER THE MARTIANS HAD WHAT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN AN AUDITORY ORGAN
766-127193-0058 A SINGLE ROUND DRUM AT THE BACK OF THE HEAD BODY AND EYES WITH A VISUAL RANGE NOT VERY DIFFERENT FROM OURS EXCEPT THAT ACCORDING TO PHILIPS BLUE AND VIOLET WERE AS BLACK TO THEM
766-127193-0059 IT IS COMMONLY SUPPOSED THAT THEY COMMUNICATED BY SOUNDS AND TENTACULAR GESTICULATIONS THIS IS ASSERTED FOR INSTANCE IN THE ABLE BUT HASTILY COMPILED PAMPHLET WRITTEN EVIDENTLY BY SOMEONE NOT AN EYE WITNESS OF MARTIAN ACTIONS
766-127193-0060 TO WHICH I HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED AND WHICH SO FAR HAS BEEN THE CHIEF SOURCE OF INFORMATION CONCERNING THEM NOW NO SURVIVING HUMAN BEING SAW SO MUCH OF THE MARTIANS IN ACTION AS I DID I TAKE NO CREDIT TO MYSELF FOR AN ACCIDENT BUT THE FACT IS SO
766-127193-0061 AND I ASSERT THAT I WATCHED THEM CLOSELY TIME AFTER TIME AND THAT I HAVE SEEN FOUR FIVE AND ONCE SIX OF THEM SLUGGISHLY PERFORMING THE MOST ELABORATELY COMPLICATED OPERATIONS TOGETHER WITHOUT EITHER SOUND OR GESTURE THEIR PECULIAR HOOTING
766-127193-0062 INVARIABLY PRECEDED FEEDING IT HAD NO MODULATION AND WAS I BELIEVE IN NO SENSE A SIGNAL BUT MERELY THE EXPIRATION OF AIR PREPARATORY TO THE SUCTIONAL OPERATION I HAVE A CERTAIN CLAIM TO AT LEAST AN ELEMENTARY KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY
766-127193-0063 AND IN THIS MATTER I AM CONVINCED AS FIRMLY AS I AM CONVINCED OF ANYTHING THAT THE MARTIANS INTERCHANGED THOUGHTS WITHOUT ANY PHYSICAL INTERMEDIATION AND I HAVE BEEN CONVINCED OF THIS IN SPITE OF STRONG PRECONCEPTIONS BEFORE THE MARTIAN INVASION
766-127193-0064 AS AN OCCASIONAL READER HERE OR THERE MAY REMEMBER I HAD WRITTEN WITH SOME LITTLE VEHEMENCE AGAINST THE TELEPATHIC THEORY THE MARTIANS WORE NO CLOTHING THEIR CONCEPTIONS OF ORNAMENT AND DECORUM WERE NECESSARILY DIFFERENT FROM OURS
766-127193-0065 AND NOT ONLY WERE THEY EVIDENTLY MUCH LESS SENSIBLE OF CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE THAN WE ARE BUT CHANGES OF PRESSURE DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE AFFECTED THEIR HEALTH AT ALL SERIOUSLY YET THOUGH THEY WORE NO CLOTHING
766-127193-0066 IT WAS IN THE OTHER ARTIFICIAL ADDITIONS TO THEIR BODILY RESOURCES THAT THEIR GREAT SUPERIORITY OVER MAN LAY WE MEN WITH OUR BICYCLES AND ROAD SKATES OUR LILIENTHAL SOARING MACHINES OUR GUNS AND STICKS AND SO FORTH ARE JUST IN THE BEGINNING OF THE EVOLUTION THAT THE MARTIANS HAVE WORKED OUT
766-127193-0067 THEY HAVE BECOME PRACTICALLY MERE BRAINS WEARING DIFFERENT BODIES ACCORDING TO THEIR NEEDS JUST AS MEN WEAR SUITS OF CLOTHES AND TAKE A BICYCLE IN A HURRY OR AN UMBRELLA IN THE WET AND OF THEIR APPLIANCES
766-127193-0068 PERHAPS NOTHING IS MORE WONDERFUL TO A MAN THAN THE CURIOUS FACT THAT WHAT IS THE DOMINANT FEATURE OF ALMOST ALL HUMAN DEVICES IN MECHANISM IS ABSENT THE WHEEL IS ABSENT
766-127193-0069 AMONG ALL THE THINGS THEY BROUGHT TO EARTH THERE IS NO TRACE OR SUGGESTION OF THEIR USE OF WHEELS
766-127193-0070 OR HAS PREFERRED OTHER EXPEDIENTS TO ITS DEVELOPMENT AND NOT ONLY DID THE MARTIANS EITHER NOT KNOW OF WHICH IS INCREDIBLE OR ABSTAIN FROM THE WHEEL BUT IN THEIR APPARATUS SINGULARLY LITTLE USE IS MADE OF THE FIXED PIVOT OR RELATIVELY FIXED PIVOT WITH CIRCULAR MOTIONS THEREABOUT CONFINED
766-127193-0071 TO ONE PLANE ALMOST ALL THE JOINTS OF THE MACHINERY PRESENT A COMPLICATED SYSTEM OF SLIDING PARTS MOVING OVER SMALL BUT BEAUTIFULLY CURVED FRICTION BEARINGS AND WHILE UPON THIS MATTER OF DETAIL IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THE LONG LEVERAGES OF THEIR MACHINES
766-127193-0072 THESE DISKS BECOME POLARISED AND DRAWN CLOSELY AND POWERFULLY TOGETHER WHEN TRAVERSED BY A CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY IN THIS WAY THE CURIOUS PARALLELISM TO ANIMAL MOTIONS WHICH WAS SO STRIKING AND DISTURBING TO THE HUMAN BEHOLDER WAS ATTAINED
766-127193-0073 SUCH QUASI MUSCLES ABOUNDED IN THE CRABLIKE HANDLING MACHINE WHICH ON MY FIRST PEEPING OUT OF THE SLIT I WATCHED UNPACKING THE CYLINDER IT SEEMED INFINITELY MORE ALIVE THAN THE ACTUAL MARTIANS LYING BEYOND IT IN THE SUNSET LIGHT PANTING STIRRING INEFFECTUAL TENTACLES
766-127193-0074 AND MOVING FEEBLY AFTER THEIR VAST JOURNEY ACROSS SPACE WHILE I WAS STILL WATCHING THEIR SLUGGISH MOTIONS IN THE SUNLIGHT AND NOTING EACH STRANGE DETAIL OF THEIR FORM THE CURATE REMINDED ME OF HIS PRESENCE BY PULLING VIOLENTLY AT MY ARM I TURNED TO A SCOWLING FACE
766-127193-0075 AND SILENT ELOQUENT LIPS HE WANTED THE SLIT WHICH PERMITTED ONLY ONE OF US TO PEEP THROUGH AND SO I HAD TO FOREGO WATCHING THEM FOR A TIME WHILE HE ENJOYED THAT PRIVILEGE WHEN I LOOKED AGAIN
766-127193-0076 INTO A SHAPE HAVING AN UNMISTAKABLE LIKENESS TO ITS OWN AND DOWN ON THE LEFT A BUSY LITTLE DIGGING MECHANISM HAD COME INTO VIEW EMITTING JETS OF GREEN VAPOUR AND WORKING ITS WAY ROUND THE PIT EXCAVATING AND EMBANKING IN A METHODICAL AND DISCRIMINATING MANNER
766-127193-0077 THAT HAD KEPT OUR RUINOUS REFUGE QUIVERING
