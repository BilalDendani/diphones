2148-6981-0000 AS WE SAW NEITHER LAND NOR SAIL FROM THE TIME OF LEAVING JUAN FERNANDEZ UNTIL OUR ARRIVAL IN CALIFORNIA
2148-6981-0001 WE CAUGHT THE SOUTH EAST TRADES AND RUN BEFORE THEM FOR NEARLY THREE WEEKS WITHOUT SO MUCH AS ALTERING A SAIL OR BRACING A YARD THE CAPTAIN TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS FINE WEATHER TO GET THE VESSEL IN ORDER FOR COMING UPON THE COAST
2148-6981-0002 THE CARPENTER WAS EMPLOYED IN FITTING UP A PART OF THE STEERAGE INTO A TRADE ROOM FOR OUR CARGO WE NOW LEARNED WAS NOT TO BE LANDED
2148-6981-0003 AND THIS TRADE ROOM WAS BUILT FOR THE SAMPLES AND THE LIGHTER GOODS TO BE KEPT IN AND AS A PLACE FOR THE GENERAL BUSINESS IN THE MEAN TIME WE WERE EMPLOYED IN WORKING UPON THE RIGGING EVERYTHING WAS SET UP TAUT THE LOWER RIGGING RATTLED DOWN
2148-6981-0004 OR RATHER RATTLED UP ACCORDING TO THE MODERN FASHION AN ABUNDANCE OF SPUN YARN AND SEIZING STUFF MADE AND FINALLY THE WHOLE STANDING RIGGING FORE AND AFT WAS TARRED DOWN
2148-6981-0005 THIS IS AN IMPORTANT OPERATION AND IS USUALLY DONE ABOUT ONCE IN SIX MONTHS IN VESSELS UPON A LONG VOYAGE IT WAS DONE IN OUR VESSEL SEVERAL TIMES AFTERWARDS BUT BY THE WHOLE CREW AT ONCE AND FINISHED OFF IN A DAY
2148-6981-0006 THE TIES RUNNERS ET CETERA AND GO OUT TO THE YARD ARMS AND COME IN TARRING AS THEY COME THE LIFTS AND FOOT ROPES TARRING THE STAYS IS MORE DIFFICULT AND IS DONE BY AN OPERATION WHICH THE SAILORS CALL RIDING DOWN
2148-6981-0007 AND ROVE THROUGH A BLOCK FOR A GIRT LINE OR AS THE SAILORS USUALLY CALL IT A GANT LINE
2148-6981-0008 AND THE OTHER END BEING FAST ON DECK WITH SOME ONE TO TEND IT
2148-6981-0009 THERE HE SINGS ALOFT TWIXT HEAVEN AND EARTH AND IF THE ROPE SLIPS BREAKS OR IS LET GO OR IF THE BOWLINE SLIPS HE FALLS OVERBOARD OR BREAKS HIS NECK THIS HOWEVER IS A THING WHICH NEVER ENTERS INTO A SAILOR'S CALCULATION
2148-6981-0010 PLACES NOT TARRED FOR IN CASE HE SHOULD HE WOULD HAVE TO GO OVER THE WHOLE AGAIN
2148-6981-0011 FOR THEN THERE WOULD BE A SOFT WORD IN HIS EAR FROM THE MATE IN THIS MANNER I TARRED DOWN ALL THE HEAD STAYS BUT FOUND THE RIGGING ABOUT THE JIB BOOMS MARTINGALE AND SPRITSAIL YARD UPON WHICH I WAS AFTERWARDS PUT THE HARDEST
2148-6981-0012 THIS DIRTY WORK COULD NOT LAST FOREVER AND ON SATURDAY NIGHT WE FINISHED IT SCRAPED ALL THE SPOTS FROM THE DECK AND RAILS AND WHAT WAS OF MORE IMPORTANCE TO US CLEANED OURSELVES THOROUGHLY ROLLED UP OUR TARRY FROCKS AND TROWSERS AND LAID THEM AWAY FOR THE NEXT OCCASION
2148-6981-0013 AND PUT ON OUR CLEAN DUCK CLOTHES AND HAD A GOOD COMFORTABLE SAILOR'S SATURDAY NIGHT THE NEXT DAY WAS PLEASANT AND INDEED WE HAD BUT ONE UNPLEASANT SUNDAY DURING THE WHOLE VOYAGE AND THAT WAS OFF CAPE HORN WHERE WE COULD EXPECT NOTHING BETTER
2148-6981-0014 THIS WORK TOO IS DONE BY THE CREW AND EVERY SAILOR WHO HAS BEEN LONG VOYAGES IS A LITTLE OF A PAINTER IN ADDITION TO HIS OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE PAINTED HER BOTH INSIDE AND OUT FROM THE TRUCK TO THE WATER'S EDGE
2148-6981-0015 THE OUTSIDE IS PAINTED BY LOWERING STAGES OVER THE SIDE BY ROPES AND ON THOSE WE SAT WITH OUR BRUSHES AND PAINT POTS BY US AND OUR FEET HALF THE TIME IN THE WATER
2148-6981-0016 THIS MUST BE DONE OF COURSE ON A SMOOTH DAY WHEN THE VESSEL DOES NOT ROLL MUCH I REMEMBER VERY WELL BEING OVER THE SIDE PAINTING IN THIS WAY ONE FINE AFTERNOON OUR VESSEL GOING QUIETLY ALONG AT THE RATE OF FOUR OR FIVE KNOTS
2148-6981-0017 AND A PILOT FISH THE SURE PRECURSOR OF THE SHARK SWIMMING ALONGSIDE OF US THE CAPTAIN WAS LEANING OVER THE RAIL WATCHING HIM
2148-6981-0018 IN THE MIDST OF OUR PAINTING ON FRIDAY DECEMBER NINETEENTH WE CROSSED THE EQUATOR FOR THE SECOND TIME
2148-6981-0019 SUCH ARE THE TRIFLES WHICH PRODUCE QUARRELS ON SHIPBOARD IN FACT WE HAD BEEN TOO LONG FROM PORT
2148-6981-0020 OUR FRESH PROVISIONS WERE OF COURSE GONE AND THE CAPTAIN HAD STOPPED OUR RICE SO THAT WE HAD NOTHING BUT SALT BEEF AND SALT PORK THROUGHOUT THE WEEK WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A VERY SMALL DUFF ON SUNDAY
2148-6981-0021 DAILY AND ALMOST HOURLY OCCURRING WHICH NO ONE WHO HAS NOT HIMSELF BEEN ON A LONG AND TEDIOUS VOYAGE CAN CONCEIVE OF OR PROPERLY APPRECIATE LITTLE WARS AND RUMORS OF WARS REPORTS OF THINGS SAID IN THE CABIN
2148-6981-0022 MISUNDERSTANDING OF WORDS AND LOOKS APPARENT ABUSES
2148-6981-0023 EVERY ENCROACHMENT UPON THE TIME ALLOWED FOR REST APPEARED UNNECESSARY
2148-6981-0024 WHERE WE HAD PREVIOUSLY LIVED INTO THE FORECASTLE THIS TO OUR DELIGHT WAS GRANTED AND WE TURNED IN TO BUNK AND MESS WITH THE CREW FORWARD WE NOW BEGAN TO FEEL LIKE SAILORS WHICH WE NEVER FULLY DID WHEN WE WERE IN THE STEERAGE
2148-6981-0025 WHILE THERE HOWEVER USEFUL AND ACTIVE YOU MAY BE YOU ARE BUT A MONGREL AND SORT OF AFTERGUARD AND SHIP'S COUSIN YOU ARE IMMEDIATELY UNDER THE EYE OF THE OFFICERS CANNOT DANCE SING PLAY SMOKE
2148-6981-0026 AND YOU LIVE WITH THE STEWARD WHO IS USUALLY A GO BETWEEN AND THE CREW NEVER FEEL AS THOUGH YOU WERE ONE OF THEM BUT IF YOU LIVE IN THE FORECASTLE YOU ARE AS INDEPENDENT AS A WOOD SAWYER'S CLERK NAUTICE
2148-6981-0027 AND ARE A SAILOR YOU HEAR SAILOR'S TALK
2148-6981-0028 AND MOREOVER PICK UP A GREAT DEAL OF CURIOUS AND USEFUL INFORMATION IN SEAMANSHIP SHIP'S CUSTOMS FOREIGN COUNTRIES ET CETERA
2148-6981-0029 AND THIS IS INDISPENSABLE TO SAILORS
2148-6981-0030 WHICH STOOD ME IN SO GOOD STEAD AFTERWARDS BUT TO RETURN TO THE STATE OF THE CREW UPON OUR COMING INTO THE FORECASTLE THERE WAS SOME DIFFICULTY ABOUT THE UNITING OF THE ALLOWANCES OF BREAD BY WHICH WE THOUGHT WE WERE TO LOSE A FEW POUNDS
2148-6981-0031 THIS SET US INTO A FERMENT THE CAPTAIN WOULD NOT CONDESCEND TO EXPLAIN AND WE WENT AFT IN A BODY
2148-6981-0032 THE OLDEST AND BEST SAILOR OF THE CREW FOR SPOKESMAN
2148-6981-0033 AND SEEING US COMING AFT STOPPED SHORT IN HIS WALK AND WITH A VOICE AND LOOK INTENDED TO ANNIHILATE US CALLED OUT
2148-6981-0034 WHEREUPON WE STATED OUR GRIEVANCES AS RESPECTFULLY AS WE COULD BUT HE BROKE IN UPON US SAYING THAT WE WERE GETTING FAT AND LAZY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TO DO
2148-6981-0035 THIS PROVOKED US AND WE BEGAN TO GIVE WORD FOR WORD
2148-6981-0036 IN WHICH OF COURSE THE WHOLE BLAME OF THE MISUNDERSTANDING WAS THROWN UPON US
2148-6981-0037 BUT IT WOULDN'T DO WE WERE DRIVEN BACK DISCOMFORTED THUS THE AFFAIR BLEW OVER BUT THE IRRITATION CAUSED BY IT REMAINED AND WE NEVER HAD PEACE OR A GOOD UNDERSTANDING AGAIN
2148-6981-0038 SO LONG AS THE CAPTAIN AND CREW REMAINED TOGETHER WE CONTINUED SAILING ALONG IN THE BEAUTIFUL TEMPERATE CLIMATE OF THE PACIFIC THE PACIFIC WELL DESERVES ITS NAME FOR EXCEPT IN THE SOUTHERN PART AT CAPE HORN
2148-6981-0039 AND IN THE WESTERN PARTS NEAR THE CHINA AND INDIAN OCEANS IT HAS FEW STORMS AND IS NEVER EITHER EXTREMELY HOT OR COLD
2148-6981-0040 LIKE A THIN GAUZE DRAWN OVER THE SUN WHICH WITHOUT OBSTRUCTING OR OBSCURING THE LIGHT TEMPERS THE HEAT WHICH COMES DOWN WITH PERPENDICULAR FIERCENESS IN THE ATLANTIC AND INDIAN TROPICS
2148-6981-0041 WE SAILED WELL TO THE WESTWARD TO HAVE THE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE NORTH EAST TRADES AND WHEN WE HAD REACHED THE LATITUDE OF POINT CONCEPTION WHERE IT IS USUAL TO MAKE THE LAND WE WERE SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES TO THE WESTWARD OF IT
2148-6981-0042 WE IMMEDIATELY CHANGED OUR COURSE DUE EAST AND SAILED IN THAT DIRECTION FOR A NUMBER OF DAYS AT LENGTH WE BEGAN TO HEAVE TO AFTER DARK FOR FEAR OF MAKING THE LAND AT NIGHT ON A COAST
2148-6981-0043 WHERE THERE ARE NO LIGHT HOUSES AND BUT INDIFFERENT CHARTS
2148-6981-0044 LYING ABOUT SIXTY MILES TO THE SOUTHWARD OF THIS POINT WE CONTINUED SAILING DOWN THE COAST DURING THE DAY AND FOLLOWING NIGHT
