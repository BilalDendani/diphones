882-123267-0000 BUT ARCTICS CAN BE INHOSPITABLE TOO
882-123267-0001 IT EXTENDS ALONG THE INNER EDGE OF A SMALL FIORD INCLOSED BETWEEN BASALTIC WALLS OF THE STRANGEST CONSTRUCTION BASALT IS A BROWNISH ROCK OF IGNEOUS ORIGIN IT ASSUMES REGULAR FORMS THE ARRANGEMENT OF WHICH IS OFTEN VERY SURPRISING
882-123267-0002 HERE NATURE HAD DONE HER WORK GEOMETRICALLY WITH SQUARE AND COMPASS AND PLUMMET EVERYWHERE ELSE HER ART CONSISTS ALONE IN THROWING DOWN HUGE MASSES TOGETHER IN DISORDER YOU SEE CONES IMPERFECTLY FORMED IRREGULAR PYRAMIDS WITH A FANTASTIC DISARRANGEMENT OF LINES
882-123267-0003 SHE HAS CREATED A SEVERELY SIMPLE ORDER OF ARCHITECTURE NEVER SURPASSED EITHER BY THE SPLENDOURS OF BABYLON OR THE WONDERS OF GREECE I HAD HEARD OF THE GIANT'S CAUSEWAY IN IRELAND AND FINGAL'S CAVE IN STAFFA ONE OF THE HEBRIDES BUT I HAD NEVER YET SEEN A BASALTIC FORMATION
882-123267-0004 AT STAPI I BEHELD THIS PHENOMENON IN ALL ITS BEAUTY THE WALL THAT CONFINED THE FIORD LIKE ALL THE COAST OF THE PENINSULA WAS COMPOSED OF A SERIES OF VERTICAL COLUMNS THIRTY FEET HIGH
882-123267-0005 AT INTERVALS UNDER THIS NATURAL SHELTER THERE SPREAD OUT VAULTED ENTRANCES IN BEAUTIFUL CURVES INTO WHICH THE WAVES CAME DASHING WITH FOAM AND SPRAY
882-123267-0006 LAY ALONG THE SOIL LIKE REMAINS OF AN ANCIENT TEMPLE IN RUINS FOR EVER FRESH AND OVER WHICH CENTURIES PASSED WITHOUT LEAVING A TRACE OF AGE UPON THEM THIS WAS OUR LAST STAGE UPON THE EARTH
882-123267-0007 HANS HAD EXHIBITED GREAT INTELLIGENCE AND IT GAVE ME SOME LITTLE COMFORT TO THINK THEN THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO LEAVE US ON ARRIVING AT THE DOOR OF THE RECTOR'S HOUSE WHICH WAS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS
882-123267-0008 SAELLVERTU SAID THE HUNTER GOD DAG SAID THE BLACKSMITH IN GOOD DANISH
882-123267-0009 THE RECTOR REPEATED THE PROFESSOR IT SEEMS AXEL THAT THIS GOOD MAN IS THE RECTOR OUR GUIDE IN THE MEANWHILE WAS MAKING THE KYRKOHERDE AWARE OF THE POSITION OF THINGS WHEN THE LATTER SUSPENDING HIS LABOURS FOR A MOMENT
882-123267-0010 UTTERED A SOUND NO DOUBT UNDERSTOOD BETWEEN HORSES AND FARRIERS AND IMMEDIATELY A TALL AND UGLY HAG APPEARED FROM THE HUT
882-123267-0011 I WAS IN GREAT ALARM LEST SHE SHOULD TREAT ME TO THE ICELANDIC KISS BUT THERE WAS NO OCCASION TO FEAR NOR DID SHE DO THE HONOURS AT ALL TOO GRACEFULLY THE VISITORS ROOM SEEMED TO ME THE WORST IN THE WHOLE CABIN IT WAS CLOSE DIRTY AND EVIL SMELLING BUT WE HAD TO BE CONTENT
882-123267-0012 VERY FAR FROM IT BEFORE THE DAY WAS OVER I SAW THAT WE HAD TO DO WITH A BLACKSMITH A FISHERMAN A HUNTER A JOINER BUT NOT AT ALL WITH A MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL
882-123267-0013 I DON'T MEAN TO SAY ANYTHING AGAINST THESE POOR PRIESTS WHO AFTER ALL ARE VERY WRETCHED THEY RECEIVE FROM THE DANISH GOVERNMENT A RIDICULOUSLY SMALL PITTANCE AND THEY GET FROM THE PARISH THE FOURTH PART OF THE TITHE
882-123267-0014 HENCE THE NECESSITY TO WORK FOR THEIR LIVELIHOOD BUT AFTER FISHING HUNTING AND SHOEING HORSES FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME ONE SOON GETS INTO THE WAYS AND MANNERS OF FISHERMEN HUNTERS AND FARRIERS AND OTHER RATHER RUDE AND UNCULTIVATED PEOPLE
882-123267-0015 AND THAT EVENING I FOUND OUT THAT TEMPERANCE WAS NOT AMONG THE VIRTUES THAT DISTINGUISHED MY HOST
882-123267-0016 INSTEAD OF A GOOD AND LEARNED MAN HE FOUND A RUDE AND COARSE PEASANT HE THEREFORE RESOLVED TO COMMENCE THE GRAND EXPEDITION AT ONCE AND TO LEAVE THIS INHOSPITABLE PARSONAGE
882-123267-0017 HE CARED NOTHING ABOUT FATIGUE AND RESOLVED TO SPEND SOME DAYS UPON THE MOUNTAIN THE PREPARATIONS FOR OUR DEPARTURE WERE THEREFORE MADE THE VERY DAY AFTER OUR ARRIVAL AT STAPI HANS HIRED THE SERVICES OF THREE ICELANDERS TO DO THE DUTY OF THE HORSES IN THE TRANSPORT OF THE BURDENS
882-123267-0018 BUT AS SOON AS WE HAD ARRIVED AT THE CRATER THESE NATIVES WERE TO TURN BACK AND LEAVE US TO OUR OWN DEVICES THIS WAS TO BE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD
882-123267-0019 HANS MERELY NODDED THERE OR ELSEWHERE DOWN IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH OR ANYWHERE ON THE SURFACE ALL WAS ALIKE TO HIM FOR MY OWN PART THE INCIDENTS OF THE JOURNEY HAD HITHERTO KEPT ME AMUSED AND MADE ME FORGETFUL OF COMING EVILS
882-123267-0020 BUT NOW MY FEARS AGAIN WERE BEGINNING TO GET THE BETTER OF ME BUT WHAT COULD I DO
882-123267-0021 ONE THOUGHT ABOVE ALL OTHERS HARASSED AND ALARMED ME IT WAS ONE CALCULATED TO SHAKE FIRMER NERVES THAN MINE NOW THOUGHT I HERE WE ARE ABOUT TO CLIMB SNAEFELL
882-123267-0022 VERY GOOD TOO OTHERS HAVE DONE AS MUCH WITHOUT DYING FOR IT BUT THAT IS NOT ALL
882-123267-0023 IF THAT ILL ADVISED SAKNUSSEMM HAS TOLD A TRUE TALE WE SHALL LOSE OUR WAY AMIDST THE DEEP SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGES OF THIS VOLCANO NOW THERE IS NO PROOF THAT SNAEFELL IS EXTINCT WHO CAN ASSURE US THAT AN ERUPTION IS NOT BREWING AT THIS VERY MOMENT
882-123267-0024 AND IF HE WAKES UP PRESENTLY WHERE SHALL WE BE IT WAS WORTH WHILE DEBATING THIS QUESTION AND I DID DEBATE IT I COULD NOT SLEEP FOR DREAMING ABOUT ERUPTIONS NOW THE PART OF EJECTED SCORIAE AND ASHES SEEMED TO MY MIND A VERY ROUGH ONE TO ACT
882-123267-0025 SO AT LAST WHEN I COULD HOLD OUT NO LONGER I RESOLVED TO LAY THE CASE BEFORE MY UNCLE AS PRUDENTLY AND AS CAUTIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE JUST UNDER THE FORM OF AN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE HYPOTHESIS I WENT TO HIM I COMMUNICATED MY FEARS TO HIM
882-123267-0026 AND DREW BACK A STEP TO GIVE HIM ROOM FOR THE EXPLOSION WHICH I KNEW MUST FOLLOW BUT I WAS MISTAKEN I WAS THINKING OF THAT HE REPLIED WITH GREAT SIMPLICITY
882-123267-0027 WAS HE ACTUALLY GOING TO LISTEN TO REASON WAS HE CONTEMPLATING THE ABANDONMENT OF HIS PLANS THIS WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
882-123267-0028 EVER SINCE WE ARRIVED AT STAPI
882-123267-0029 FOR WE MUST NOT BE GUILTY OF IMPRUDENCE NO INDEED I REPLIED WITH FORCIBLE EMPHASIS FOR SIX HUNDRED YEARS SNAEFELL HAS BEEN DUMB
882-123267-0030 NOW ERUPTIONS ARE ALWAYS PRECEDED BY CERTAIN WELL KNOWN PHENOMENA I HAVE THEREFORE EXAMINED THE NATIVES I HAVE STUDIED EXTERNAL APPEARANCES AND I CAN ASSURE YOU AXEL THAT THERE WILL BE NO ERUPTION AT THIS POSITIVE AFFIRMATION I STOOD AMAZED AND SPEECHLESS
882-123267-0031 YOU DON'T DOUBT MY WORD SAID MY UNCLE WELL FOLLOW ME I OBEYED LIKE AN AUTOMATON COMING OUT FROM THE PRIEST'S HOUSE THE PROFESSOR TOOK A STRAIGHT ROAD WHICH THROUGH AN OPENING IN THE BASALTIC WALL LED AWAY FROM THE SEA
882-123267-0032 WE WERE SOON IN THE OPEN COUNTRY IF ONE MAY GIVE THAT NAME TO A VAST EXTENT OF MOUNDS OF VOLCANIC PRODUCTS THIS TRACT SEEMED CRUSHED UNDER A RAIN OF ENORMOUS EJECTED ROCKS OF TRAP BASALT GRANITE AND ALL KINDS OF IGNEOUS ROCKS
882-123267-0033 HERE AND THERE I COULD SEE PUFFS AND JETS OF STEAM CURLING UP INTO THE AIR CALLED IN ICELANDIC REYKIR ISSUING FROM THERMAL SPRINGS AND INDICATING BY THEIR MOTION THE VOLCANIC ENERGY UNDERNEATH THIS SEEMED TO JUSTIFY MY FEARS
882-123267-0034 BUT I FELL FROM THE HEIGHT OF MY NEW BORN HOPES WHEN MY UNCLE SAID YOU SEE ALL THESE VOLUMES OF STEAM AXEL WELL THEY DEMONSTRATE THAT WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM THE FURY OF A VOLCANIC ERUPTION
882-123267-0035 UNDERSTAND THIS CLEARLY ADDED THE PROFESSOR AT THE APPROACH OF AN ERUPTION THESE JETS WOULD REDOUBLE THEIR ACTIVITY BUT DISAPPEAR ALTOGETHER DURING THE PERIOD OF THE ERUPTION FOR THE ELASTIC FLUIDS BEING NO LONGER UNDER PRESSURE
882-123267-0036 GO OFF BY WAY OF THE CRATER INSTEAD OF ESCAPING BY THEIR USUAL PASSAGES THROUGH THE FISSURES IN THE SOIL THEREFORE IF THESE VAPOURS REMAIN IN THEIR USUAL CONDITION IF THEY DISPLAY NO AUGMENTATION OF FORCE
882-123267-0037 AND IF YOU ADD TO THIS THE OBSERVATION THAT THE WIND AND RAIN ARE NOT CEASING AND BEING REPLACED BY A STILL AND HEAVY ATMOSPHERE THEN YOU MAY AFFIRM THAT NO ERUPTION IS PREPARING BUT NO MORE THAT IS SUFFICIENT
882-123267-0038 WHEN SCIENCE HAS UTTERED HER VOICE LET BABBLERS HOLD THEIR PEACE I RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE VERY CRESTFALLEN MY UNCLE HAD BEATEN ME WITH THE WEAPONS OF SCIENCE STILL I HAD ONE HOPE LEFT AND THIS WAS
882-123267-0039 THAT WHEN WE HAD REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR WANT OF A PASSAGE TO GO DEEPER IN SPITE OF ALL THE SAKNUSSEMM'S IN ICELAND I SPENT THAT WHOLE NIGHT IN ONE CONSTANT NIGHTMARE IN THE HEART OF A VOLCANO
882-123267-0040 AND FROM THE DEEPEST DEPTHS OF THE EARTH I SAW MYSELF TOSSED UP AMONGST THE INTERPLANETARY SPACES UNDER THE FORM OF AN ERUPTIVE ROCK THE NEXT DAY JUNE TWENTY THIRD HANS WAS AWAITING US WITH HIS COMPANIONS CARRYING PROVISIONS TOOLS AND INSTRUMENTS
882-123267-0041 TWO IRON POINTED STICKS TWO RIFLES AND TWO SHOT BELTS WERE FOR MY UNCLE AND MYSELF HANS AS A CAUTIOUS MAN HAD ADDED TO OUR LUGGAGE A LEATHERN BOTTLE FULL OF WATER WHICH WITH THAT IN OUR FLASKS WOULD ENSURE US A SUPPLY OF WATER FOR EIGHT DAYS
882-123267-0042 IT WAS NINE IN THE MORNING THE PRIEST AND HIS TALL MEGAERA WERE AWAITING US AT THE DOOR WE SUPPOSED THEY WERE STANDING THERE TO BID US A KIND FAREWELL BUT THE FAREWELL WAS PUT IN THE UNEXPECTED FORM OF A HEAVY BILL
882-123267-0043 IN WHICH EVERYTHING WAS CHARGED EVEN TO THE VERY AIR WE BREATHED IN THE PASTORAL HOUSE INFECTED AS IT WAS THIS WORTHY COUPLE WERE FLEECING US JUST AS A SWISS INNKEEPER MIGHT HAVE DONE AND ESTIMATED THEIR IMPERFECT HOSPITALITY AT THE HIGHEST PRICE
