5468-58929-0000 I CAN'T STAY SHE ANSWERED DICKON'S WAITING FOR ME AND SHE RAN AWAY THE AFTERNOON WAS EVEN LOVELIER AND BUSIER THAN THE MORNING HAD BEEN ALREADY NEARLY ALL THE WEEDS WERE CLEARED OUT OF THE GARDEN AND MOST OF THE ROSES AND TREES HAD BEEN PRUNED OR DUG ABOUT
5468-58929-0001 DICKON HAD BROUGHT A SPADE OF HIS OWN AND HE HAD TAUGHT MARY TO USE ALL HER TOOLS
5468-58929-0002 IT WOULD BE A WILDERNESS OF GROWING THINGS BEFORE THE SPRINGTIME WAS OVER THERE'LL BE APPLE BLOSSOMS AN CHERRY BLOSSOMS OVERHEAD DICKON SAID WORKING AWAY WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
5468-58929-0003 THE LITTLE FOX AND THE ROOK WERE AS HAPPY AND BUSY AS THEY WERE AND THE ROBIN AND HIS MATE FLEW BACKWARD AND FORWARD LIKE TINY STREAKS OF LIGHTNING SOMETIMES THE ROOK FLAPPED HIS BLACK WINGS AND SOARED AWAY OVER THE TREE TOPS IN THE PARK
5468-58929-0004 EACH TIME HE CAME BACK AND PERCHED NEAR DICKON
5468-58929-0005 AND DICKON TALKED TO HIM JUST AS HE HAD TALKED TO THE ROBIN
5468-58929-0006 AND GENTLY TWEAKED HIS EAR WITH HIS LARGE BEAK WHEN MARY WANTED TO REST A LITTLE DICKON SAT DOWN WITH HER UNDER A TREE
5468-58929-0007 AND PLAYED THE SOFT STRANGE LITTLE NOTES
5468-58929-0008 THA'S A GOOD BIT STRONGER THAN THA WAS DICKON SAID LOOKING AT HER AS SHE WAS DIGGING THA'S BEGINNING TO LOOK DIFFERENT FOR SURE MARY WAS GLOWING WITH EXERCISE AND GOOD SPIRITS I'M GETTING FATTER AND FATTER EVERY DAY SHE SAID QUITE EXULTANTLY
5468-58929-0009 MARTHA SAYS MY HAIR IS GROWING THICKER
5468-58929-0010 SHE WANTED TO TELL COLIN ABOUT DICKON'S FOX CUB AND THE ROOK AND ABOUT WHAT THE SPRINGTIME HAD BEEN DOING SHE FELT SURE HE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR
5468-58929-0011 TO SEE MARTHA STANDING WAITING FOR HER WITH A DOLEFUL FACE WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE ASKED WHAT DID COLIN SAY WHEN YOU TOLD HIM I COULDN'T COME
5468-58929-0012 I WISH THA'D GONE HE WAS NIGH GOIN INTO ONE O HIS TANTRUMS THERE'S BEEN A NICE TO DO ALL AFTERNOON TO KEEP HIM QUIET
5468-58929-0013 MARY'S LIPS PINCHED THEMSELVES TOGETHER
5468-58929-0014 AND SHE SAW NO REASON WHY AN ILL TEMPERED BOY SHOULD INTERFERE WITH THE THING SHE LIKED BEST SHE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE PITIFULNESS OF PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN ILL AND NERVOUS AND WHO DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY COULD CONTROL THEIR TEMPERS
5468-58929-0015 WHEN SHE HAD HAD A HEADACHE IN INDIA
5468-58929-0016 BUT OF COURSE NOW SHE FELT THAT COLIN WAS QUITE WRONG
5468-58929-0017 THIS WAS A BAD BEGINNING AND MARY MARCHED UP TO HIM WITH HER STIFF MANNER WHY DIDN'T YOU GET UP SHE SAID
5468-58929-0018 HE ANSWERED WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER I MADE THEM PUT ME BACK IN BED THIS AFTERNOON MY BACK ACHED AND MY HEAD ACHED AND I WAS TIRED WHY DIDN'T YOU COME I WAS WORKING IN THE GARDEN WITH DICKON SAID MARY COLIN FROWNED AND CONDESCENDED TO LOOK AT HER
5468-58929-0019 HE SAID MARY FLEW INTO A FINE PASSION SHE COULD FLY INTO A PASSION WITHOUT MAKING A NOISE
5468-58929-0020 IF YOU SEND DICKON AWAY I'LL NEVER COME INTO THIS ROOM AGAIN SHE RETORTED
5468-58929-0021 AND HAD A ROUGH AND TUMBLE FIGHT AS IT WAS THEY DID THE NEXT THING TO IT YOU ARE A SELFISH THING
5468-58929-0022 WHAT ARE YOU SAID MARY SELFISH PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY THAT ANY ONE IS SELFISH WHO DOESN'T DO WHAT THEY WANT YOU'RE MORE SELFISH THAN I AM YOU'RE THE MOST SELFISH BOY I EVER SAW I'M NOT SNAPPED COLIN
5468-58929-0023 HE'S SELFISH IF YOU LIKE MARY'S EYES FLASHED FIRE HE'S NICER THAN ANY OTHER BOY THAT EVER LIVED SHE SAID HE'S HE'S LIKE AN ANGEL IT MIGHT SOUND RATHER SILLY TO SAY THAT BUT SHE DID NOT CARE A NICE ANGEL COLIN SNEERED FEROCIOUSLY
5468-58929-0024 HE'S BETTER THAN A COMMON RAJAH RETORTED MARY HE'S A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER BECAUSE SHE WAS THE STRONGER OF THE TWO SHE WAS BEGINNING TO GET THE BETTER OF HIM THE TRUTH WAS THAT HE HAD NEVER HAD A FIGHT WITH ANY ONE LIKE HIMSELF IN HIS LIFE
5468-58929-0025 NOT FOR ANY ONE ELSE I'M NOT AS SELFISH AS YOU BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS ILL AND I'M SURE THERE IS A LUMP COMING ON MY BACK HE SAID
5468-58929-0026 YOU'RE NOT CONTRADICTED MARY UNSYMPATHETICALLY HE OPENED HIS EYES QUITE WIDE WITH INDIGNATION
5468-58929-0027 HE WAS AT ONCE FURIOUS AND SLIGHTLY PLEASED IF A PERSON COULD BE BOTH AT ONE TIME I'M NOT HE CRIED I AM YOU KNOW I AM EVERYBODY SAYS SO I DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID MARY SOURLY
5468-58929-0028 YOU JUST SAY THAT TO MAKE PEOPLE SORRY I BELIEVE YOU'RE PROUD OF IT I DON'T BELIEVE IT IF YOU WERE A NICE BOY IT MIGHT BE TRUE BUT YOU'RE TOO NASTY
5468-58929-0029 GET OUT OF THE ROOM HE SHOUTED
5468-58929-0030 BUT MARY'S FACE LOOKED AS PINCHED AS A NUTCRACKER I'M GOING SHE SAID AND I WON'T COME BACK SHE WALKED TO THE DOOR
5468-58929-0031 NOW I WON'T TELL YOU A SINGLE THING
5468-58929-0032 SHE FOUND THE TRAINED NURSE STANDING AS IF SHE HAD BEEN LISTENING AND MORE AMAZING STILL SHE WAS LAUGHING SHE WAS A BIG HANDSOME YOUNG WOMAN WHO OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN A TRAINED NURSE AT ALL AS SHE COULD NOT BEAR INVALIDS AND SHE WAS ALWAYS MAKING EXCUSES TO LEAVE COLIN TO MARTHA
5468-58929-0033 WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT SHE ASKED HER AT YOU TWO YOUNG ONES SAID THE NURSE
5468-58929-0034 THAT'S AS SPOILED AS HIMSELF AND SHE LAUGHED INTO HER HANDKERCHIEF AGAIN IF HE'D HAD A YOUNG VIXEN OF A SISTER TO FIGHT WITH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAVING OF HIM IS HE GOING TO DIE
5468-58929-0035 SAID THE NURSE HYSTERICS AND TEMPER ARE HALF WHAT AILS HIM WHAT ARE HYSTERICS ASKED MARY
5468-58929-0036 MARY WENT BACK TO HER ROOM NOT FEELING AT ALL
5468-58929-0037 SHE WAS CROSS AND DISAPPOINTED
5468-58929-0038 SHE FELT SO SOUR AND UNRELENTING THAT FOR A FEW MINUTES SHE ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT DICKON AND THE GREEN VEIL CREEPING OVER THE WORLD AND THE SOFT WIND BLOWING
5468-58929-0039 DOLLS TOYS BOOKS SHE OPENED THE PACKAGE WONDERING IF HE HAD SENT A DOLL
5468-58929-0040 AND TWO OF THEM WERE ABOUT GARDENS AND WERE FULL OF PICTURES THERE WERE TWO OR THREE GAMES AND THERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE WRITING CASE WITH A GOLD MONOGRAM ON IT AND A GOLD PEN AND INKSTAND EVERYTHING WAS SO NICE THAT HER PLEASURE BEGAN TO CROWD HER ANGER OUT OF HER MIND
5468-58929-0041 AND THEY WOULD HAVE LOOKED AT THE PICTURES AND READ SOME OF THE GARDENING BOOKS AND PERHAPS TRIED PLAYING THE GAMES AND HE WOULD HAVE ENJOYED HIMSELF SO MUCH
5468-58929-0042 HE HAD A WAY OF DOING THAT WHICH SHE COULD NOT BEAR
5468-58929-0043 BECAUSE HE ALWAYS LOOKED SO FRIGHTENED HIMSELF
5468-58929-0044 HE SHOULD KNOW HIS HUNCH HAD BEGUN TO GROW SOMETHING HE HAD HEARD MISSUS MEDLOCK WHISPERING TO THE NURSE HAD GIVEN HIM THE IDEA
5468-58929-0045 THAT MOST OF HIS TANTRUMS AS THEY CALLED THEM GREW OUT OF HIS HYSTERICAL HIDDEN FEAR MARY HAD BEEN SORRY FOR HIM WHEN HE HAD TOLD HER HE ALWAYS BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT IT WHEN HE WAS CROSS OR TIRED
