5252-4860-0000 THE BITER BIT ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A MAN CALLED SIMON WHO WAS VERY RICH BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS STINGY AND MISERLY AS HE COULD BE HE HAD A HOUSEKEEPER CALLED NINA A
5252-4860-0001 CLEVER CAPABLE WOMAN AND AS SHE DID HER WORK CAREFULLY AND CONSCIENTIOUSLY HER MASTER HAD THE GREATEST RESPECT FOR HER IN HIS YOUNG DAYS SIMON HAD BEEN ONE OF THE GAYEST AND MOST ACTIVE YOUTHS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BUT AS HE GREW OLD AND STIFF HE FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO WALK
5252-4860-0002 AND HIS FAITHFUL SERVANT URGED HIM TO GET A HORSE SO AS TO SAVE HIS POOR OLD BONES AT LAST SIMON GAVE WAY TO THE REQUEST AND PERSUASIVE ELOQUENCE OF HIS HOUSEKEEPER AND BETOOK HIMSELF ONE DAY TO THE MARKET WHERE HE HAD SEEN A MULE WHICH HE THOUGHT WOULD JUST SUIT HIM
5252-4860-0003 AND WHICH HE BOUGHT FOR SEVEN GOLD PIECES NOW IT HAPPENED THAT THERE WERE THREE MERRY RASCALS HANGING ABOUT THE MARKET PLACE WHO MUCH PREFERRED LIVING ON OTHER PEOPLE'S GOODS TO WORKING FOR THEIR OWN LIVING AS SOON AS THEY SAW THAT SIMON HAD BOUGHT A MULE ONE OF THEM SAID TO HIS TWO BOON COMPANIONS
5252-4860-0004 MY FRIENDS THIS MULE MUST BE OURS BEFORE WE ARE MANY HOURS OLDER BUT HOW SHALL WE MANAGE IT ASKED ONE OF THEM WE MUST ALL THREE STATION OURSELVES AT DIFFERENT INTERVALS ALONG THE OLD MAN'S HOMEWARD WAY AND MUST EACH IN HIS TURN DECLARE THAT THE MULE HE HAS BOUGHT IS A DONKEY
5252-4860-0005 IF WE ONLY STICK TO IT YOU'LL SEE THE MULE WILL SOON BE OURS THIS PROPOSAL QUITE SATISFIED THE OTHERS AND THEY ALL SEPARATED AS THEY HAD AGREED NOW WHEN SIMON CAME BY THE FIRST ROGUE SAID TO HIM GOD BLESS YOU MY FINE GENTLEMAN
5252-4860-0006 THANKS FOR YOUR COURTESY REPLIED SIMON WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ASKED THE THIEF TO THE MARKET WAS THE REPLY AND WHAT DID YOU BUY THERE CONTINUED THE ROGUE THIS MULE WHICH MULE
5252-4860-0007 THE ONE I'M SITTING UPON TO BE SURE REPLIED SIMON ARE YOU IN EARNEST OR ONLY JOKING WHAT DO YOU MEAN BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME YOU'VE GOT HOLD OF A DONKEY AND NOT OF A MULE A DONKEY RUBBISH SCREAMED SIMON
5252-4860-0008 AND WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD HE RODE ON HIS WAY AFTER A FEW HUNDRED YARDS HE MET THE SECOND CONFEDERATE WHO ADDRESSED HIM GOOD DAY DEAR SIR WHERE ARE YOU COMING FROM FROM THE MARKET ANSWERED SIMON DID THINGS GO PRETTY CHEAP ASKED THE OTHER
5252-4860-0009 YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY SO IF A SINGLE OTHER PERSON TELLS ME THAT I'LL MAKE HIM A PRESENT OF THE WRETCHED ANIMAL WITH THESE WORDS HE CONTINUED HIS WAY AND VERY SOON MET THE THIRD KNAVE WHO SAID TO HIM GOD BLESS YOU SIR ARE YOU BY ANY CHANCE COMING FROM THE MARKET
5252-4860-0010 YES I AM REPLIED SIMON AND WHAT BARGAIN DID YOU DRIVE THERE ASKED THE CUNNING FELLOW I BOUGHT THIS MULE ON WHICH I AM RIDING A MULE ARE YOU SPEAKING SERIOUSLY OR DO YOU WISH TO MAKE A FOOL OF ME
5252-4860-0011 YOU ARE THE THIRD PERSON IN THE LAST TWO HOURS WHO HAS TOLD ME THE SAME THING SAID SIMON BUT I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT AND DISMOUNTING FROM THE MULE HE SPOKE KEEP THE ANIMAL I MAKE YOU A PRESENT OF IT THE RASCAL TOOK THE BEAST
5252-4860-0012 AT LEAST SO HE HAD BEEN ASSURED BY SEVERAL PEOPLE HE HAD MET ON THE ROAD AND THAT IN DISGUST HE HAD AT LAST GIVEN IT AWAY OH YOU SIMPLETON CRIED NINA DIDN'T YOU SEE THAT THEY WERE ONLY PLAYING YOU A TRICK REALLY I THOUGHT YOU'D HAVE HAD MORE GUMPTION THAN THAT
5252-4860-0013 NEVER MIND REPLIED SIMON I'LL PLAY THEM ONE WORTH TWO OF THAT FOR DEPEND UPON IT THEY WON'T BE CONTENTED WITH HAVING GOT THE DONKEY OUT OF ME BUT THEY'LL TRY BY SOME NEW DODGE TO GET SOMETHING MORE OR I'M MUCH MISTAKEN
5252-4860-0014 NOW THERE LIVED IN THE VILLAGE NOT FAR FROM SIMON'S HOUSE A PEASANT WHO HAD TWO GOATS SO ALIKE IN EVERY RESPECT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH ONE FROM THE OTHER SIMON BOUGHT THEM BOTH PAID AS SMALL A PRICE AS HE COULD FOR THEM
5252-4860-0015 AND LEADING THEM HOME WITH HIM HE TOLD NINA TO PREPARE A GOOD MEAL AS HE WAS GOING TO INVITE SOME FRIENDS TO DINNER HE ORDERED HER TO ROAST SOME VEAL AND TO BOIL A PAIR OF CHICKENS AND GAVE HER SOME HERBS TO MAKE A GOOD SAVOURY AND TOLD HER TO BAKE THE BEST TART SHE COULD MAKE
5252-4860-0016 THEN HE TOOK ONE OF THE GOATS AND TIED IT TO A POST IN THE COURTYARD AND GAVE IT SOME GRASS TO EAT BUT HE BOUND A CORD ROUND THE NECK OF THE OTHER GOAT AND LED IT TO THE MARKET
5252-4860-0017 HARDLY HAD HE ARRIVED THERE THAN THE THREE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD GOT HIS MULE PERCEIVED HIM AND COMING UP TO HIM SAID WELCOME MISTER SIMON WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE ARE YOU ON THE LOOK OUT FOR A BARGAIN I'VE COME TO GET SOME PROVISIONS HE ANSWERED
5252-4860-0018 AND TO BAKE THE BEST TART SHE CAN MAKE HAVE YOU FOLLOWED ME THEN GO AND HEAVEN'S BLESSING GO WITH YOU AS SOON AS IT FELT ITSELF FREE THE LADEN GOAT TROTTED OFF AS QUICKLY AS IT COULD AND TO THIS DAY NOBODY KNOWS WHAT BECAME OF IT
5252-4860-0019 THEY WERE NOT A LITTLE ASTONISHED AT THIS FOR OF COURSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS THE SAME GOAT THAT SIMON HAD SENT HOME LADEN WITH PROVISIONS AS SOON AS THEY REACHED THE HOUSE MISTER SIMON SAID TO HIS HOUSEKEEPER WELL NINA HAVE YOU DONE WHAT I TOLD THE GOAT TO TELL YOU TO DO
5252-4860-0020 THE ARTFUL WOMAN WHO AT ONCE UNDERSTOOD HER MASTER ANSWERED CERTAINLY I HAVE THE VEAL IS ROASTED AND THE CHICKENS BOILED THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID SIMON WHEN THE THREE ROGUES SAW THE COOKED MEATS AND THE TART IN THE OVEN AND HEARD NINA'S WORDS
5252-4860-0021 THEY WERE NEARLY BESIDE THEMSELVES WITH AMAZEMENT AND BEGAN TO CONSULT AT ONCE HOW THEY WERE TO GET THE GOAT INTO THEIR OWN POSSESSION AT LAST TOWARDS THE END OF THE MEAL HAVING SOUGHT IN VAIN FOR SOME CUNNING DODGE TO GET THE GOAT AWAY FROM MISTER SIMON ONE OF THEM SAID TO HIM
5252-4860-0022 THE KNAVES WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE DOING A CAPITAL PIECE OF BUSINESS PAID DOWN THE FIFTY GOLD PIECES AT ONCE AND LEFT THE HOUSE QUITE HAPPILY LEADING THE GOAT WITH THEM WHEN THEY GOT HOME THEY SAID TO THEIR WIVES YOU NEEDN'T BEGIN TO COOK THE DINNER TO MORROW TILL WE SEND THE PROVISIONS HOME
5252-4860-0023 THE FOLLOWING DAY THEY WENT TO THE MARKET AND BOUGHT CHICKENS AND OTHER EATABLES AND AFTER THEY HAD PACKED THEM ON THE BACK OF THE GOAT WHICH THEY HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM THEY TOLD IT ALL THE DISHES THEY WISHED THEIR WIVES TO PREPARE AS SOON AS THE GOAT FELT ITSELF FREE IT RAN AS QUICKLY AS IT COULD
5252-4860-0024 AND WAS VERY SOON LOST TO SIGHT AND AS FAR AS I KNOW WAS NEVER HEARD OF AGAIN WHEN THE DINNER HOUR APPROACHED ALL THREE WENT HOME AND ASKED THEIR WIVES IF THE GOAT HAD RETURNED WITH THE NECESSARY PROVISIONS AND HAD TOLD THEM WHAT THEY WISHED PREPARED FOR THEIR MEAL
5252-4860-0025 OH YOU FOOLS AND BLOCKHEADS CRIED THEIR WIVES HOW COULD YOU EVER BELIEVE FOR A MOMENT THAT A GOAT WOULD DO THE WORK OF A SERVANT MAID YOU HAVE BEEN FINELY DECEIVED FOR ONCE IN A WAY OF COURSE IF YOU ARE ALWAYS TAKING IN OTHER PEOPLE YOUR TURN TO BE TAKEN IN COMES TOO
5252-4860-0026 AND THIS TIME YOU'VE BEEN MADE TO LOOK PRETTY FOOLISH WHEN THE THREE COMRADES SAW THAT MISTER SIMON HAD GOT THE BETTER OF THEM AND DONE THEM OUT OF FIFTY GOLD PIECES THEY FLEW INTO SUCH A RAGE THAT THEY MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO KILL HIM AND SEIZING THEIR WEAPONS FOR THIS PURPOSE WENT TO HIS HOUSE
5252-4860-0027 BUT THE SLY OLD MAN WHO WAS TERRIFIED FOR HIS LIFE THAT THE THREE ROGUES MIGHT DO HIM SOME HARM WAS ON HIS GUARD AND SAID TO HIS HOUSEKEEPER NINA TAKE THIS BLADDER WHICH IS FILLED WITH BLOOD AND HIDE IT UNDER YOUR CLOAK THEN WHEN THESE THIEVES COME
5252-4860-0028 I'LL LAY ALL THE BLAME ON YOU AND WILL PRETEND TO BE SO ANGRY WITH YOU THAT I WILL RUN AT YOU WITH MY KNIFE AND PIERCE THE BLADDER WITH IT THEN YOU MUST FALL ON THE GROUND AS IF YOU WERE DEAD AND LEAVE THE REST TO ME HARDLY HAD SIMON SAID THESE WORDS WHEN THE THREE ROGUES APPEARED AND FELL ON HIM TO KILL HIM
5252-4860-0029 MY FRIENDS CALLED OUT SIMON TO THEN WHAT DO YOU ACCUSE ME OF I AM IN NO WAY TO BLAME PERHAPS MY HOUSEKEEPER HAS DONE YOU SOME INJURY OF WHICH I KNOW NOTHING AND WITH THESE WORDS HE TURNED ON NINA WITH HIS KNIFE
5252-4860-0030 AND STUCK IT RIGHT INTO HER SO THAT HE PIERCED THE BLADDER FILLED WITH BLOOD INSTANTLY THE HOUSEKEEPER FELL DOWN AS IF SHE WERE DEAD AND THE BLOOD STREAMED ALL OVER THE GROUND SIMON THEN PRETENDED TO BE SEIZED WITH REMORSE AT THE SIGHT OF THIS DREADFUL CATASTROPHE
5252-4860-0031 AND CRIED OUT IN A LOUD VOICE UNHAPPY WRETCH THAT I AM WHAT HAVE I DONE LIKE A MADMAN I HAVE KILLED THE WOMAN WHO IS THE PROP AND STAY OF MY OLD AGE HOW COULD I EVER GO ON LIVING WITHOUT HER THEN HE SEIZED A PIPE
5252-4860-0032 AND WHEN HE HAD BLOWN INTO IT FOR SOME TIME NINA SPRANG UP ALIVE AND WELL THE ROGUES WERE MORE AMAZED THAN EVER THEY FORGOT THEIR ANGER AND BUYING THE PIPE FOR TWO HUNDRED GOLD PIECES THEY WENT JOYFULLY HOME NOT LONG AFTER THIS ONE OF THEM QUARRELLED WITH HIS WIFE
5252-4860-0033 AND IN HIS RAGE HE THRUST HIS KNIFE INTO HER BREAST SO THAT SHE FELL DEAD ON THE GROUND THEN HE TOOK SIMON'S PIPE AND BLEW INTO IT WITH ALL HIS MIGHT IN THE HOPES OF CALLING HIS WIFE BACK TO LIFE BUT HE BLEW IN VAIN FOR THE POOR SOUL WAS AS DEAD AS A DOOR NAIL
5252-4860-0034 THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO THE THIRD ROGUE SO THAT THEY WERE NOW ALL THREE WITHOUT WIVES FULL OF WRATH THEY RAN TO SIMON'S HOUSE AND REFUSING TO LISTEN TO A WORD OF EXPLANATION OR EXCUSE THEY SEIZED THE OLD MAN AND PUT HIM INTO A SACK
5252-4860-0035 MEANING TO DROWN HIM IN THE NEIGHBOURING RIVER ON THEIR WAY THERE HOWEVER A SUDDEN NOISE THREW THEM INTO SUCH A PANIC THAT THEY DROPPED THE SACK WITH SIMON IN IT AND RAN FOR THEIR LIVES
5252-4860-0036 WHO PAUSED HERE AND THERE BY THE WAYSIDE TO BROWSE ON THE TENDER GRASS HE HEARD A PITIFUL VOICE WAILING THEY INSIST ON MY TAKING HER AND I DON'T WANT HER FOR I AM TOO OLD AND I REALLY CAN'T HAVE HER THE SHEPHERD WAS MUCH STARTLED
5252-4860-0037 FOR HE COULDN'T MAKE OUT WHERE THESE WORDS WHICH WERE REPEATED MORE THAN ONCE CAME FROM AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT AT LAST HE PERCEIVED THE SACK IN WHICH SIMON WAS HIDDEN
5252-4860-0038 AND GOING UP TO IT HE OPENED IT AND DISCOVERED SIMON REPEATING HIS DISMAL COMPLAINT THE SHEPHERD ASKED HIM WHY HE HAD BEEN LEFT THERE TIED UP IN A SACK SIMON REPLIED THAT THE KING OF THE COUNTRY HAD INSISTED ON GIVING HIM ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS AS A WIFE
5252-4860-0039 THE SIMPLE MINDED SHEPHERD WHO BELIEVED HIS STORY IMPLICITLY ASKED HIM DO YOU THINK THE KING OF THE COUNTRY WOULD GIVE HIS DAUGHTER TO ME YES CERTAINLY I KNOW HE WOULD ANSWERED SIMON IF YOU WERE TIED UP IN THIS SACK INSTEAD OF ME
5252-4860-0040 THEN GETTING OUT OF THE SACK HE TIED THE CONFIDING SHEPHERD UP IN IT INSTEAD AND AT HIS REQUEST FASTENED IT SECURELY AND DROVE THE SHEEP ON HIMSELF AN HOUR HAD SCARCELY PASSED WHEN THE THREE ROGUES RETURNED TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY HAD LEFT SIMON IN THE SACK
5252-4860-0041 AND WITHOUT OPENING IT ONE OF THEM SEIZED IT AND THREW IT INTO THE RIVER AND SO THE POOR SHEPHERD WAS DROWNED INSTEAD OF MISTER SIMON THE THREE ROGUES HAVING WREAKED THEIR VENGEANCE SET OUT FOR HOME ON THEIR WAY THEY NOTICED A FLOCK OF SHEEP GRAZING NOT FAR FROM THE ROAD
5252-4860-0042 THEY LONGED TO STEAL A FEW OF THE LAMBS AND APPROACHED THE FLOCK AND WERE MORE THAN STARTLED TO RECOGNISE MISTER SIMON WHOM THEY HAD DROWNED IN THE RIVER AS THE SHEPHERD WHO WAS LOOKING AFTER THE SHEEP THEY ASKED HIM HOW HE HAD MANAGED TO GET OUT OF THE RIVER TO WHICH HE REPLIED
5252-4860-0043 GET ALONG WITH YOU YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN SILLY DONKEYS WITHOUT ANY SENSE IF YOU HAD ONLY DROWNED ME IN DEEPER WATER I WOULD HAVE RETURNED WITH THREE TIMES AS MANY SHEEP WHEN THE THREE ROGUES HEARD THIS THEY SAID TO HIM OH DEAR MISTER SIMON
5252-4860-0044 DO US THE FAVOUR TO TIE US UP IN SACKS AND THROW US INTO THE RIVER THAT WE MAY GIVE UP OUR THIEVING WAYS AND BECOME THE OWNERS OF FLOCKS I AM READY ANSWERED SIMON TO DO WHAT YOU PLEASE THERE'S NOTHING IN THE WORLD I WOULDN'T DO FOR YOU
5252-4860-0045 AND FASTENED THEM UP SO TIGHTLY THAT THEY COULDN'T GET OUT AND THEN HE THREW THEM ALL INTO THE RIVER
