690-134308-0000 ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF POLICE T X MEREDITH DID NOT OCCUPY OFFICES IN NEW SCOTLAND YARD IT IS THE PECULIARITY OF PUBLIC OFFICES THAT THEY ARE PLANNED WITH THE IDEA OF SUPPLYING THE MARGIN OF SPACE ABOVE ALL REQUIREMENTS
690-134308-0001 AND THAT ON THEIR COMPLETION THEY ARE FOUND WHOLLY INADEQUATE TO HOUSE THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS WHICH MYSTERIOUSLY COME INTO PROGRESS COINCIDENT WITH THE BUILDING OPERATIONS
690-134308-0002 THE HOUSE WAS AN OLD ONE FACING THE BOARD OF TRADE AND THE INSCRIPTION ON THE ANCIENT DOOR TOLD PASSERS BY THAT THIS WAS THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR SPECIAL BRANCH THE DUTIES OF T X WERE MULTIFARIOUS
690-134308-0003 PEOPLE SAID OF HIM AND LIKE MOST PUBLIC GOSSIP THIS WAS PROBABLY UNTRUE
690-134308-0004 IF BY CHANCE YOU LOST THE KEYS OF YOUR SAFE
690-134308-0005 TO JUSTIFY A PROSECUTION AND IF IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE GOOD OF THE COMMUNITY THAT THAT PERSON SHOULD BE DEPORTED IT WAS T X WHO ARRESTED THE OBNOXIOUS PERSON
690-134308-0006 HUSTLED HIM INTO A CAB AND DID NOT LOOSE HIS HOLD UPON HIS VICTIM UNTIL HE HAD LANDED HIM ON THE INDIGNANT SHORES OF AN OTHERWISE FRIENDLY POWER
690-134308-0007 BURNT THE LOCKS FROM HIS SAFE AND SECURED THE NECESSARY INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE
690-134308-0008 MYSTERIOUS UNDER SECRETARIES OF STATE WHO DISCUSS THINGS IN WHISPERS IN THE REMOTE CORNERS OF THEIR CLUBROOMS AND THE MORE FRANK VIEWS OF AMERICAN CORRESPONDENTS WHO HAD NO HESITATION IN PUTTING THOSE VIEWS INTO PRINT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR READERS
690-134308-0009 THAT T X HAD A MORE LEGITIMATE OCCUPATION WE KNOW FOR IT WAS THAT FLIPPANT MAN WHOSE OUTRAGEOUS COMMENT ON THE HOME OFFICE ADMINISTRATION IS POPULARLY SUPPOSED TO HAVE SENT ONE HOME SECRETARY TO HIS GRAVE
690-134308-0010 AND WHO BROUGHT TO BOOK SIR JULIUS WAGLITE THOUGH HE HAD COVERED HIS TRAIL OF DEFALCATION THROUGH THE BALANCE SHEETS OF THIRTY FOUR COMPANIES
690-134308-0011 IN APPEARANCE T X CONVEYED THE IMPRESSION OF EXTREME YOUTH FOR HIS FACE WAS ALMOST BOYISH AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN YOU LOOKED AT HIM CLOSELY AND SAW THE LITTLE CREASES ABOUT HIS EYES THE SETTING OF HIS STRAIGHT MOUTH THAT YOU GUESSED HE WAS ON THE WAY TO FORTY
690-134308-0012 AND HAD WRITTEN A SLIGHT VOLUME OF WOODLAND LYRICS THE MENTION OF WHICH AT THIS LATER STAGE WAS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE HIM FEEL VIOLENTLY UNHAPPY IN MANNER HE WAS TACTFUL BUT PERSISTENT HIS LANGUAGE WAS AT TIMES MARKED BY A VIOLENT EXTRAVAGANCE
690-134308-0013 AND HE HAD HAD THE DISTINCTION OF HAVING PROVOKED BY CERTAIN CORRESPONDENCE WHICH HAD SEEN THE LIGHT THE COMMENT OF A FORMER HOME SECRETARY THAT IT WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT MISTER MEREDITH DID NOT TAKE HIS POSITION WITH THE SERIOUSNESS WHICH WAS EXPECTED FROM A PUBLIC OFFICIAL
690-134308-0014 HIS LANGUAGE WAS AS I SAY UNDER GREAT PROVOCATION VIOLENT AND UNUSUAL
690-134308-0015 AND ILLUSTRATING HIS INSTRUCTION OR HIS ADMONITION WITH THE QUAINTEST PHRASEOLOGY NOW HE WAS TILTED BACK IN HIS OFFICE CHAIR AT AN ALARMING ANGLE SCOWLING AT HIS DISTRESSED SUBORDINATE WHO SAT ON THE EDGE OF A CHAIR AT THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS DESK
690-134308-0016 BUT T X PROTESTED THE INSPECTOR THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE FOUND IT WAS THE OUTRAGEOUS PRACTICE OF MISTER MEREDITH TO INSIST UPON HIS ASSOCIATES CALLING HIM BY HIS INITIALS A PRACTICE WHICH HAD EARNT DISAPPROVAL IN THE HIGHEST QUARTERS
690-134308-0017 NOTHING IS TO BE FOUND HE REPEATED WRATHFULLY
690-134308-0018 HE SAT UP WITH A SUDDENNESS WHICH CAUSED THE POLICE OFFICER TO START BACK IN ALARM LISTEN SAID T X GRASPING AN IVORY PAPERKNIFE SAVAGELY IN HIS HAND AND TAPPING HIS BLOTTING PAD TO EMPHASIZE HIS WORDS
690-134308-0019 A POLICEMAN EXCLAIMED THE EXASPERATED T X YOU'RE WORSE THAN A PIE YOU'RE A SLUD
690-134308-0020 HE SHOOK HIS HEAD SORROWFULLY AT THE SMILING MANSUS WHO HAD BEEN IN THE POLICE FORCE WHEN T X WAS A SMALL BOY AT SCHOOL YOU ARE NEITHER WISE NOR WILY YOU COMBINE THE INNOCENCE OF A BABY WITH THE GRUBBINESS OF A COUNTY PARSON YOU OUGHT TO BE IN THE CHOIR
690-134308-0021 AT THIS OUTRAGEOUS INSULT MISTER MANSUS WAS SILENT WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE SAID OR WHAT FURTHER PROVOCATION HE MIGHT HAVE RECEIVED MAY BE NEVER KNOWN FOR AT THAT MOMENT THE CHIEF HIMSELF WALKED IN
690-134308-0022 THE CHIEF OF THE POLICE IN THESE DAYS WAS A GREY MAN RATHER TIRED WITH A HAWK NOSE AND DEEP EYES THAT GLARED UNDER SHAGGY EYEBROWS
