294-129973-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE SUDDEN TERMINATION OF COLONEL BRANDON'S VISIT AT THE PARK WITH HIS STEADINESS IN CONCEALING ITS CAUSE FILLED THE MIND AND RAISED THE WONDER OF MISSUS JENNINGS FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS SHE WAS A GREAT WONDERER
294-129973-0001 AS EVERY ONE MUST BE WHO TAKES A VERY LIVELY INTEREST IN ALL THE COMINGS AND GOINGS OF ALL THEIR ACQUAINTANCE SHE WONDERED WITH LITTLE INTERMISSION WHAT COULD BE THE REASON OF IT WAS SURE THERE MUST BE SOME BAD NEWS
294-129973-0002 WITH A FIXED DETERMINATION THAT HE SHOULD NOT ESCAPE THEM ALL SOMETHING VERY MELANCHOLY MUST BE THE MATTER I AM SURE SAID SHE I COULD SEE IT IN HIS FACE
294-129973-0003 FOR WHAT ELSE CAN IT BE I WONDER WHETHER IT IS SO I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO KNOW THE TRUTH OF IT PERHAPS IT IS ABOUT MISS WILLIAMS AND BY THE BYE I DARE SAY IT IS BECAUSE HE LOOKED SO CONSCIOUS WHEN I MENTIONED HER
294-129973-0004 MAY BE SHE IS ILL IN TOWN NOTHING IN THE WORLD MORE LIKELY FOR I HAVE A NOTION SHE IS ALWAYS RATHER SICKLY I WOULD LAY ANY WAGER IT IS ABOUT MISS WILLIAMS IT IS NOT SO VERY LIKELY HE SHOULD BE DISTRESSED IN HIS CIRCUMSTANCES NOW
294-129973-0005 FOR HE IS A VERY PRUDENT MAN AND TO BE SURE MUST HAVE CLEARED THE ESTATE BY THIS TIME I WONDER WHAT IT CAN BE MAY BE HIS SISTER IS WORSE AT AVIGNON AND HAS SENT FOR HIM OVER HIS SETTING OFF IN SUCH A HURRY SEEMS VERY LIKE IT
294-129973-0006 WELL I WISH HIM OUT OF ALL HIS TROUBLE WITH ALL MY HEART AND A GOOD WIFE INTO THE BARGAIN SO WONDERED SO TALKED MISSUS JENNINGS HER OPINION VARYING WITH EVERY FRESH CONJECTURE AND ALL SEEMING EQUALLY PROBABLE AS THEY AROSE ELINOR
294-129973-0007 THOUGH SHE FELT REALLY INTERESTED IN THE WELFARE OF COLONEL BRANDON COULD NOT BESTOW ALL THE WONDER ON HIS GOING SO SUDDENLY AWAY WHICH MISSUS JENNINGS WAS DESIROUS OF HER FEELING FOR BESIDES THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE DID NOT IN HER OPINION JUSTIFY SUCH LASTING AMAZEMENT
294-129973-0008 OR VARIETY OF SPECULATION HER WONDER WAS OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IT WAS ENGROSSED BY THE EXTRAORDINARY SILENCE OF HER SISTER AND WILLOUGHBY ON THE SUBJECT WHICH THEY MUST KNOW TO BE PECULIARLY INTERESTING TO THEM ALL AS THIS SILENCE CONTINUED
294-129973-0009 EVERY DAY MADE IT APPEAR MORE STRANGE AND MORE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE DISPOSITION OF BOTH WHY THEY SHOULD NOT OPENLY ACKNOWLEDGE TO HER MOTHER AND HERSELF WHAT THEIR CONSTANT BEHAVIOUR TO EACH OTHER DECLARED TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE
294-129973-0010 SHE COULD EASILY CONCEIVE THAT MARRIAGE MIGHT NOT BE IMMEDIATELY IN THEIR POWER FOR THOUGH WILLOUGHBY WAS INDEPENDENT THERE WAS NO REASON TO BELIEVE HIM RICH HIS ESTATE HAD BEEN RATED BY SIR JOHN AT ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED A YEAR
294-129973-0011 BUT HE LIVED AT AN EXPENSE TO WHICH THAT INCOME COULD HARDLY BE EQUAL AND HE HAD HIMSELF OFTEN COMPLAINED OF HIS POVERTY BUT FOR THIS STRANGE KIND OF SECRECY MAINTAINED BY THEM RELATIVE TO THEIR ENGAGEMENT WHICH IN FACT CONCEALED NOTHING AT ALL
294-129973-0012 SHE COULD NOT ACCOUNT AND IT WAS SO WHOLLY CONTRADICTORY TO THEIR GENERAL OPINIONS AND PRACTICE THAT A DOUBT SOMETIMES ENTERED HER MIND OF THEIR BEING REALLY ENGAGED AND THIS DOUBT WAS ENOUGH TO PREVENT HER MAKING ANY INQUIRY OF MARIANNE
294-129973-0013 NOTHING COULD BE MORE EXPRESSIVE OF ATTACHMENT TO THEM ALL THAN WILLOUGHBY'S BEHAVIOUR TO MARIANNE IT HAD ALL THE DISTINGUISHING TENDERNESS WHICH A LOVER'S HEART COULD GIVE AND TO THE REST OF THE FAMILY IT WAS THE AFFECTIONATE ATTENTION OF A SON AND A BROTHER
294-129973-0014 THE COTTAGE SEEMED TO BE CONSIDERED AND LOVED BY HIM AS HIS HOME
294-129973-0015 AT THE SIDE OF MARIANNE AND BY HIS FAVOURITE POINTER AT HER FEET ONE EVENING IN PARTICULAR ABOUT A WEEK AFTER COLONEL BRANDON LEFT THE COUNTRY HIS HEART SEEMED MORE THAN USUALLY OPEN
294-129973-0016 HER DESIGN OF IMPROVING THE COTTAGE IN THE SPRING HE WARMLY OPPOSED EVERY ALTERATION OF A PLACE WHICH AFFECTION HAD ESTABLISHED AS PERFECT WITH HIM WHAT HE EXCLAIMED IMPROVE THIS DEAR COTTAGE NO THAT I WILL NEVER CONSENT TO
294-129973-0017 NOT A STONE MUST BE ADDED TO ITS WALLS NOT AN INCH TO ITS SIZE IF MY FEELINGS ARE REGARDED DO NOT BE ALARMED SAID MISS DASHWOOD NOTHING OF THE KIND WILL BE DONE
294-129973-0018 I AM HEARTILY GLAD OF IT HE CRIED MAY SHE ALWAYS BE POOR IF SHE CAN EMPLOY HER RICHES NO BETTER THANK YOU WILLOUGHBY BUT YOU MAY BE ASSURED THAT I WOULD NOT SACRIFICE ONE SENTIMENT OF LOCAL ATTACHMENT OF YOURS OR OF ANY ONE WHOM I LOVED
294-129973-0019 FOR ALL THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE WORLD DEPEND UPON IT THAT WHATEVER UNEMPLOYED SUM MAY REMAIN WHEN I MAKE UP MY ACCOUNTS IN THE SPRING I WOULD EVEN RATHER LAY IT USELESSLY BY THAN DISPOSE OF IT IN A MANNER SO PAINFUL TO YOU
294-129973-0020 BUT ARE YOU REALLY SO ATTACHED TO THIS PLACE AS TO SEE NO DEFECT IN IT I AM SAID HE TO ME IT IS FAULTLESS NAY MORE I CONSIDER IT AS THE ONLY FORM OF BUILDING IN WHICH HAPPINESS IS ATTAINABLE
294-129973-0021 AND BUILD IT UP AGAIN IN THE EXACT PLAN OF THIS COTTAGE WITH DARK NARROW STAIRS AND A KITCHEN THAT SMOKES I SUPPOSE SAID ELINOR YES CRIED HE IN THE SAME EAGER TONE WITH ALL AND EVERY THING BELONGING TO IT
294-129973-0022 SHOULD THE LEAST VARIATION BE PERCEPTIBLE THEN AND THEN ONLY UNDER SUCH A ROOF I MIGHT PERHAPS BE AS HAPPY AT COMBE AS I HAVE BEEN AT BARTON I FLATTER MYSELF REPLIED ELINOR THAT EVEN UNDER THE DISADVANTAGE OF BETTER ROOMS AND A BROADER STAIRCASE
294-129973-0023 YOU WILL HEREAFTER FIND YOUR OWN HOUSE AS FAULTLESS AS YOU NOW DO THIS THERE CERTAINLY ARE CIRCUMSTANCES SAID WILLOUGHBY
294-129973-0024 BUT THIS PLACE WILL ALWAYS HAVE ONE CLAIM OF MY AFFECTION WHICH NO OTHER CAN POSSIBLY SHARE MISSUS DASHWOOD LOOKED WITH PLEASURE AT MARIANNE WHOSE FINE EYES WERE FIXED SO EXPRESSIVELY ON WILLOUGHBY AS PLAINLY DENOTED HOW WELL SHE UNDERSTOOD HIM
294-129973-0025 HOW OFTEN DID I WISH ADDED HE WHEN I WAS AT ALLENHAM THIS TIME TWELVEMONTH THAT BARTON COTTAGE WERE INHABITED I NEVER PASSED WITHIN VIEW OF IT WITHOUT ADMIRING ITS SITUATION AND GRIEVING THAT NO ONE SHOULD LIVE IN IT
294-129973-0026 HOW LITTLE DID I THEN THINK THAT THE VERY FIRST NEWS I SHOULD HEAR FROM MISSUS SMITH WHEN I NEXT CAME INTO THE COUNTRY WOULD BE THAT BARTON COTTAGE WAS TAKEN AND I FELT AN IMMEDIATE SATISFACTION AND INTEREST IN THE EVENT
294-129973-0027 CAN ACCOUNT FOR MUST IT NOT HAVE BEEN SO MARIANNE SPEAKING TO HER IN A LOWERED VOICE THEN CONTINUING HIS FORMER TONE HE SAID AND YET THIS HOUSE YOU WOULD SPOIL MISSUS DASHWOOD
294-129973-0028 YOU WOULD ROB IT OF ITS SIMPLICITY BY IMAGINARY IMPROVEMENT AND THIS DEAR PARLOUR IN WHICH OUR ACQUAINTANCE FIRST BEGAN AND IN WHICH SO MANY HAPPY HOURS HAVE BEEN SINCE SPENT BY US TOGETHER YOU WOULD DEGRADE TO THE CONDITION OF A COMMON ENTRANCE
294-129973-0029 AND EVERY BODY WOULD BE EAGER TO PASS THROUGH THE ROOM WHICH HAS HITHERTO CONTAINED WITHIN ITSELF MORE REAL ACCOMMODATION AND COMFORT THAN ANY OTHER APARTMENT OF THE HANDSOMEST DIMENSIONS IN THE WORLD COULD POSSIBLY AFFORD
294-129973-0030 MISSUS DASHWOOD AGAIN ASSURED HIM THAT NO ALTERATION OF THE KIND SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED YOU ARE A GOOD WOMAN HE WARMLY REPLIED YOUR PROMISE MAKES ME EASY EXTEND IT A LITTLE FARTHER AND IT WILL MAKE ME HAPPY
294-129973-0031 TELL ME THAT NOT ONLY YOUR HOUSE WILL REMAIN THE SAME BUT THAT I SHALL EVER FIND YOU AND YOURS AS UNCHANGED AS YOUR DWELLING AND THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS CONSIDER ME WITH THE KINDNESS WHICH HAS MADE EVERYTHING BELONGING TO YOU SO DEAR TO ME THE PROMISE WAS READILY GIVEN
294-129973-0032 DECLARED AT ONCE HIS AFFECTION AND HAPPINESS SHALL WE SEE YOU TOMORROW TO DINNER SAID MISSUS DASHWOOD WHEN HE WAS LEAVING THEM I DO NOT ASK YOU TO COME IN THE MORNING FOR WE MUST WALK TO THE PARK TO CALL ON LADY MIDDLETON
