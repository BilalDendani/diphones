5933-91994-0000 MICHEL HAD SAID A THOUSAND THINGS IN FAVOUR OF HIS NIECE AND NOT A WORD TO HER PREJUDICE BUT HE HAD SO SPOKEN OR HAD ENDEAVOURED SO TO SPEAK AS TO MAKE URMAND UNDERSTAND THAT MARIE COULD ONLY BE WON WITH DIFFICULTY
5933-91994-0001 AND THAT SHE WAS PERHAPS UNACCOUNTABLY AVERSE TO THE IDEA OF MATRIMONY SHE IS LIKE A YOUNG FILLY YOU KNOW THAT STARTS AND PLUNGES WHEN SHE IS TOUCHED HE HAD SAID YOU THINK THERE IS NOBODY ELSE URMAND HAD ASKED
5933-91994-0002 THEN MICHEL VOSS HAD ANSWERED WITH CONFIDENCE I AM SURE THERE IS NOBODY ELSE
5933-91994-0003 BUT WHEN AT SUPPER HE SAW THAT THE UNCLE WAS RUFFLED IN HIS TEMPER AND SAT SILENT WITH A BLACK BROW THAT MADAME VOSS WAS TROUBLED IN SPIRIT AND THAT MARIE DISPENSED HER SOUP WITHOUT VOUCHSAFING A LOOK TO ANY ONE
5933-91994-0004 HE FELT THAT IT BEHOVED HIM TO DO HIS BEST AND HE DID IT HE TALKED FREELY TO MADAME VOSS TELLING HER THE NEWS FROM BASLE
5933-91994-0005 AND HOW FLAX WAS LIKELY TO BE DEARER THAN EVER HE HAD SEEN IT AND HOW THE TRAVELLING ENGLISH WERE FEWER THIS YEAR THAN USUAL TO THE GREAT DETRIMENT OF THE INNKEEPERS
5933-91994-0006 SPEAKING IN A CHEERY TONE AND STRIVING HIS BEST TO DISPEL A BLACK SILENCE WHICH ON THE PRESENT OCCASION WOULD HAVE BEEN SPECIALLY LUGUBRIOUS UPON THE WHOLE HE DID HIS WORK WELL AND MICHEL VOSS WAS AWARE OF IT
5933-91994-0007 BUT MARIE BROMAR ENTERTAINED NO GENTLE THOUGHT RESPECTING HIM HE WAS NOT WANTED THERE AND HE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE COME
5933-91994-0008 NOTHING SHE DECLARED TO HERSELF WAS MEANER THAN A MAN WHO WOULD GO TO A GIRL'S PARENTS OR GUARDIANS FOR SUPPORT
5933-91994-0009 MARIE HAD PROMISED THAT SHE WOULD TRY BUT EVERY FEELING OF HER HEART WAS AGAINST THE STRUGGLE AFTER SUPPER MICHEL WITH HIS YOUNG FRIEND SAT SOME TIME AT THE TABLE
5933-91994-0010 FOR THE INNKEEPER HAD BROUGHT FORTH A BOTTLE OF HIS BEST BURGUNDY IN HONOUR OF THE OCCASION WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THEIR FRUIT MADAME VOSS LEFT THE ROOM AND MICHEL AND ADRIAN WERE SOON ALONE TOGETHER SAY NOTHING TO HER TILL TO MORROW SAID MICHEL IN A LOW VOICE
5933-91994-0011 I WILL NOT SAID ADRIAN I DO NOT WONDER THAT SHE SHOULD BE PUT OUT OF FACE IF SHE KNOWS WHY I HAVE COME OF COURSE SHE KNOWS GIVE HER TO NIGHT AND TO MORROW AND WE WILL SEE HOW IT IS TO BE
5933-91994-0012 AT THIS TIME MARIE WAS UP STAIRS WITH THE CHILDREN RESOLUTE THAT NOTHING SHOULD INDUCE HER TO GO DOWN TILL SHE SHOULD BE SURE THAT THEIR VISITOR HAD GONE TO HIS CHAMBER
5933-91994-0013 THERE WERE MANY THINGS ABOUT THE HOUSE WHICH IT WAS HER CUSTOM TO SEE IN THEIR PLACE BEFORE SHE WENT TO HER REST AND NOBODY SHOULD SAY THAT SHE NEGLECTED HER WORK BECAUSE OF THIS DRESSED UP DOLL BUT SHE WOULD WAIT TILL SHE WAS SURE OF HIM TILL SHE WAS SURE OF HER UNCLE ALSO
5933-91994-0014 IN HER PRESENT FRAME OF MIND SHE COULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN TO THE DOLL WITH ORDINARY COURTESY WHAT SHE FEARED WAS THAT HER UNCLE SHOULD SEEK HER UP STAIRS BUT MICHEL HAD SOME IDEA THAT HER PART IN THE PLAY WAS NOT AN EASY ONE AND WAS MINDED TO SPARE HER FOR THAT NIGHT
5933-91994-0015 BUT SHE HAD PROMISED TO TRY AND SHE MUST BE REMINDED OF HER PROMISE HITHERTO SHE CERTAINLY HAD NOT TRIED HITHERTO SHE HAD BEEN ILL TEMPERED PETULANT AND ALMOST RUDE HE WOULD NOT SEE HER HIMSELF THIS EVENING BUT HE WOULD SEND A MESSAGE TO HER BY HIS WIFE
5933-91994-0016 AND AS HE SPOKE THERE CERTAINLY WERE NO SMILES ON HIS OWN I SUPPOSE SHE IS FLURRIED SAID MADAME VOSS AH FLURRIED THAT MAY DO FOR TO NIGHT I HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD TO HER HAD SHE BEEN MY OWN I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN KINDER
5933-91994-0017 I HAVE LOVED HER JUST AS IF SHE WERE MY OWN OF COURSE I LOOK NOW FOR THE OBEDIENCE OF A CHILD SHE DOES NOT MEAN TO BE UNDUTIFUL MICHEL I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT MEANING I LIKE REALITY AND I WILL HAVE IT TOO
5933-91994-0018 I CONSULTED HERSELF AND WAS MORE FORBEARING THAN MOST FATHERS WOULD BE I TALKED TO HER ABOUT IT AND SHE PROMISED ME THAT SHE WOULD DO HER BEST TO ENTERTAIN THE MAN NOW SHE RECEIVES HIM AND ME WITH AN OLD FROCK AND A SULKY FACE WHO PAYS FOR HER CLOTHES
5933-91994-0019 I AM ANGRY WITH HER DO NOT BE ANGRY WITH HER I THINK I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY SHE DID NOT PUT ON ANOTHER FROCK SO CAN I UNDERSTAND I CAN UNDERSTAND WELL ENOUGH I AM NOT A FOOL
5933-91994-0020 DOES SHE THINK SOME COUNT FROM PARIS IS TO COME AND FETCH HER NAY MICHEL I THINK SHE EXPECTS NOTHING OF THAT SORT
5933-91994-0021 UPON MY WORD AND HONOUR I CAN'T CONCEIVE WHAT IT IS THAT SHE WANTS I CAN'T INDEED IT WAS PERHAPS THE FAULT OF MICHEL VOSS THAT HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THAT A YOUNG WOMAN SHOULD LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM AND HAVE A WANT WHICH HE DID NOT CONCEIVE
5933-91994-0022 POOR MARIE ALL THAT SHE WANTED NOW AT THIS MOMENT WAS TO BE LET ALONE
5933-91994-0023 MADAME VOSS IN OBEDIENCE TO HER HUSBAND'S COMMANDS WENT UP TO MARIE AND FOUND HER SITTING IN THE CHILDREN'S ROOM LEANING WITH HER HEAD ON HER HAND AND HER ELBOW ON THE TABLE WHILE THE CHILDREN WERE ASLEEP AROUND HER
5933-91994-0024 SHE WAS WAITING TILL THE HOUSE SHOULD BE QUIET SO THAT SHE COULD GO DOWN AND COMPLETE HER WORK
5933-91994-0025 NEVER MIND THAT TO NIGHT MARIE O YES I WILL GO DOWN PRESENTLY I SHOULD NOT BE HAPPY IF THE THINGS WERE NOT PUT STRAIGHT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT THE HOUSE EVERYWHERE
5933-91994-0026 NO WE NEED NOT BE LIKE PIGS SAID MADAME VOSS
5933-91994-0027 YOUR UNCLE WON'T BE UP YET THEN SHE LED THE WAY AND MARIE FOLLOWED HER YOUR UNCLE IS BECOMING ANGRY MARIE BECAUSE BECAUSE WHY HAVE I DONE ANYTHING TO MAKE HIM ANGRY
5933-91994-0028 I AM NOT CROSS AUNT JOSEY I WENT ON JUST THE SAME AS I ALWAYS DO
5933-91994-0029 YOU GAVE HIM A SORT OF A PROMISE AND NOW HE THINKS THAT YOU ARE BREAKING IT I GAVE HIM NO PROMISE SAID MARIE STOUTLY
5933-91994-0030 HOW WOULD THE THINGS GO IF I TOOK TO TALKING TO THE PEOPLE AND LEFT EVERYTHING TO THAT LITTLE GOOSE PETER UNCLE MICHEL IS UNREASONABLE AND UNKIND HE MEANS TO DO THE BEST BY YOU IN HIS POWER
5933-91994-0031 THEN LET HIM LEAVE ME ALONE I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO BE DONE IF I WERE HIS DAUGHTER HE WOULD NOT GRUDGE ME PERMISSION TO STOP AT HOME IN HIS HOUSE I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE I HAVE NEVER COMPLAINED
5933-91994-0032 BUT MY DEAR IT IS TIME THAT YOU SHOULD BE SETTLED IN THE WORLD I AM SETTLED I DON'T WANT ANY OTHER SETTLEMENT IF THEY WILL ONLY LET ME ALONE MARIE SAID MADAME VOSS AFTER A SHORT PAUSE
5933-91994-0033 IS IT THAT AUNT JOSEY THAT MAKES MY UNCLE GO ON LIKE THIS ASKED MARIE YOU DO NOT ANSWER ME CHILD
5933-91994-0034 I DO NOT KNOW WHAT ANSWER YOU WANT WHEN GEORGE WAS HERE I HARDLY SPOKE TO HIM IF UNCLE MICHEL IS AFRAID OF ME I WILL GIVE HIM MY SOLEMN PROMISE NEVER TO MARRY ANY ONE WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION
5933-91994-0035 GEORGE VOSS WILL NEVER COME BACK FOR YOU SAID MADAME VOSS HE WILL COME WHEN I ASK HIM SAID MARIE FLASHING ROUND UPON HER AUNT WITH ALL THE FIRE OF HER BRIGHT EYES DOES ANY ONE SAY THAT I HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO BRING HIM TO ME
5933-91994-0036 IF SO IT IS FALSE WHOEVER SAYS IT I HAVE DONE NOTHING HE HAS GONE AWAY AND LET HIM STAY I SHALL NOT SEND FOR HIM UNCLE MICHEL NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF ME BECAUSE OF GEORGE
5933-91994-0037 BY THIS TIME MARIE WAS SPEAKING ALMOST IN A FURY OF PASSION AND HER AUNT WAS ALMOST SUBDUED BY HER NOBODY IS AFRAID OF YOU MARIE SHE SAID NOBODY NEED BE IF THEY WILL LET ME ALONE I WILL DO NO HARM TO ANY ONE
5933-91994-0038 WHY SHOULD I WISH TO BE MARRIED IF I LIKED HIM I WOULD TAKE HIM BUT I DON'T O AUNT JOSEY I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE MY FRIEND I CANNOT BE YOUR FRIEND MARIE IF YOU OPPOSE YOUR UNCLE HE HAS DONE EVERYTHING FOR YOU AND HE MUST KNOW BEST WHAT IS GOOD FOR YOU
5933-91994-0039 I CARE NOTHING FOR GEORGE SAID MARIE AS SHE LEFT THE ROOM NOTHING AT ALL NOTHING ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS LISTENING AT HER OWN DOOR SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF HER UNCLE'S FEET AS HE WENT TO HIS ROOM AND KNEW THAT THE HOUSE WAS QUIET
5933-91994-0040 THEN SHE CREPT FORTH AND WENT ABOUT HER BUSINESS NOBODY SHOULD SAY THAT SHE NEGLECTED ANYTHING BECAUSE OF THIS UNHAPPINESS
5933-91994-0041 SHE BRUSHED THE CRUMBS FROM THE LONG TABLE AND SMOOTHED THE CLOTH FOR THE NEXT MORNING'S BREAKFAST SHE PUT AWAY BOTTLES AND DISHES AND SHE LOCKED UP CUPBOARDS AND SAW THAT THE WINDOWS AND THE DOORS WERE FASTENED THEN SHE WENT DOWN TO HER BOOKS IN THE LITTLE OFFICE BELOW STAIRS
5933-91994-0042 IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HER DAILY DUTY THERE WERE ENTRIES TO BE MADE AND FIGURES TO BE ADJUSTED WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT SHE HAD BEEN DRIVEN UPSTAIRS BY FEAR OF HER LOVER AND HER UNCLE BUT BY THE TIME THAT SHE TOOK HERSELF UP TO BED
5933-91994-0043 NOTHING HAD BEEN OMITTED AND AFTER THE BOOK WAS CLOSED SHE SAT THERE TRYING TO RESOLVE WHAT SHE WOULD DO NOTHING HAD PERHAPS GIVEN HER SO SHARP A PANG AS HER AUNT'S ASSURANCE THAT GEORGE VOSS WOULD NOT COME BACK TO HER
5933-91994-0044 AS HER AUNT'S SUSPICION THAT SHE WAS LOOKING FOR HIS RETURN IT WAS NOT THAT SHE HAD BEEN DESERTED BUT THAT OTHERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAUNT HER WITH HER DESOLATION
5933-91994-0045 SHE HAD NEVER WHISPERED THE NAME OF GEORGE TO ANY ONE SINCE HE HAD LEFT GRANPERE AND SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SPARED THIS INDIGNITY IF HE FANCIES I WANT TO INTERFERE WITH HIM SHE SAID TO HERSELF THINKING OF HER UNCLE AND OF HER UNCLE'S PLANS IN REFERENCE TO HIS SON
5933-91994-0046 THEN IT OCCURRED TO HER
5933-91994-0047 SHE SAT THERE THINKING OF IT TILL THE NIGHT WAS HALF SPENT AND WHEN SHE CREPT UP COLD TO BED SHE HAD ALMOST MADE UP HER MIND THAT IT WOULD BE BEST FOR HER TO DO AS HER UNCLE WISHED AS FOR LOVING THE MAN THAT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION
