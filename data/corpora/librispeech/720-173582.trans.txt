720-173582-0000 THE LADY RISING UP WITH SUCH AN AIR AS VENUS ROSE WITH FROM THE WAVE ON THEM BENT LIKE AN ANTELOPE A PAPHIAN PAIR OF EYES WHICH PUT OUT EACH SURROUNDING GEM
720-173582-0001 WHO FIRST KISS'D THE HEM OF HER DEEP PURPLE ROBE AND SPEAKING LOW POINTED TO JUAN WHO REMAIN'D BELOW HER PRESENCE WAS AS LOFTY AS HER STATE
720-173582-0002 HER BEAUTY OF THAT OVERPOWERING KIND WHOSE FORCE DESCRIPTION ONLY WOULD ABATE I D RATHER LEAVE IT MUCH TO YOUR OWN MIND THAN LESSEN IT BY WHAT I COULD RELATE OF FORMS AND FEATURES
720-173582-0003 IT WOULD STRIKE YOU BLIND COULD I DO JUSTICE TO THE FULL DETAIL SO LUCKILY FOR BOTH MY PHRASES FAIL THUS MUCH HOWEVER I MAY ADD HER YEARS WERE RIPE
720-173582-0004 THEY MIGHT MAKE SIX AND TWENTY SPRINGS BUT THERE ARE FORMS WHICH TIME TO TOUCH FORBEARS AND TURNS ASIDE HIS SCYTHE TO VULGAR THINGS SUCH AS WAS MARY'S QUEEN OF SCOTS
720-173582-0005 TRUE TEARS AND LOVE DESTROY AND SAPPING SORROW WRINGS CHARMS FROM THE CHARMER YET SOME NEVER GROW UGLY FOR INSTANCE
720-173582-0006 I WON'T BE BAIL FOR ANYTHING BEYOND THEY BOW'D OBEISANCE AND WITHDREW
720-173582-0007 MUCH FITTED FOR INSPIRING MARVEL AND PRAISE FOR BOTH OR NONE THINGS WIN AND I MUST SAY I NE'ER COULD SEE THE VERY GREAT HAPPINESS OF THE NIL ADMIRARI NOT TO ADMIRE IS ALL THE ART I KNOW
720-173582-0008 PLAIN TRUTH DEAR MURRAY NEEDS FEW FLOWERS OF SPEECH TO MAKE MEN HAPPY OR TO KEEP THEM SO SO TAKE IT IN THE VERY WORDS OF CREECH
720-173582-0009 THUS HORACE WROTE WE ALL KNOW LONG AGO AND THUS POPE QUOTES THE PRECEPT TO RE TEACH FROM HIS TRANSLATION BUT HAD NONE ADMIRED WOULD POPE HAVE SUNG OR HORACE BEEN INSPIRED BABA
720-173582-0010 BUT HE COULD NOT STOOP TO ANY SHOE UNLESS IT SHOD THE POPE
720-173582-0011 HE STOOD LIKE ATLAS WITH A WORLD OF WORDS ABOUT HIS EARS AND NATHLESS WOULD NOT BEND THE BLOOD OF ALL HIS LINE S CASTILIAN LORDS BOIL'D IN HIS VEINS AND RATHER THAN DESCEND TO STAIN HIS PEDIGREE
720-173582-0012 A THOUSAND SWORDS A THOUSAND TIMES OF HIM HAD MADE AN END
720-173582-0013 BABA PROPOSED THAT HE SHOULD KISS THE HAND HERE WAS AN HONOURABLE COMPROMISE A HALF WAY HOUSE OF DIPLOMATIC REST WHERE THEY MIGHT MEET IN MUCH MORE PEACEFUL GUISE
720-173582-0014 ADDING THAT THIS WAS COMMONEST AND BEST FOR THROUGH THE SOUTH THE CUSTOM STILL COMMANDS THE GENTLEMAN TO KISS THE LADY'S HANDS AND HE ADVANCED THOUGH WITH BUT A BAD GRACE
720-173582-0015 THOUGH ON MORE THOROUGH BRED OR FAIRER FINGERS NO LIPS E'ER LEFT THEIR TRANSITORY TRACE ON SUCH AS THESE THE LIP TOO FONDLY LINGERS AND FOR ONE KISS WOULD FAIN IMPRINT A BRACE
720-173582-0016 AND SOMETIMES EVEN A FAIR STRANGER'S AN ALMOST TWELVEMONTH'S CONSTANCY ENDANGERS
720-173582-0017 AS IF WELL USED TO THE RETREATING TRADE AND
720-173582-0018 AND LOOKING ON HIM WITH A SORT OF SMILE TOOK LEAVE WITH SUCH A FACE OF SATISFACTION AS GOOD MEN WEAR WHO HAVE DONE A VIRTUOUS ACTION WHEN HE WAS GONE THERE WAS A SUDDEN CHANGE
720-173582-0019 AND IN HER LARGE EYES WROUGHT A MIXTURE OF SENSATIONS MIGHT BE SCANN'D OF HALF VOLUPTUOUSNESS AND HALF COMMAND HER FORM HAD ALL THE SOFTNESS OF HER SEX
720-173582-0020 HER FEATURES ALL THE SWEETNESS OF THE DEVIL WHEN HE PUT ON THE CHERUB TO PERPLEX EVE AND PAVED GOD KNOWS HOW THE ROAD TO EVIL THE SUN HIMSELF WAS SCARCE MORE FREE FROM SPECKS THAN SHE FROM AUGHT AT WHICH THE EYE COULD CAVIL
720-173582-0021 YET SOMEHOW THERE WAS SOMETHING SOMEWHERE WANTING AS IF SHE RATHER ORDER'D THAN WAS GRANTING
720-173582-0022 AND RAPTURE'S SELF WILL SEEM ALMOST A PAIN WITH AUGHT WHICH LOOKS LIKE DESPOTISM IN VIEW OUR SOULS AT LEAST ARE FREE AND T IS IN VAIN WE WOULD AGAINST THEM MAKE THE FLESH OBEY
720-173582-0023 THE SPIRIT IN THE END WILL HAVE ITS WAY HER VERY SMILE WAS HAUGHTY THOUGH SO SWEET HER VERY NOD WAS NOT AN INCLINATION THERE WAS A SELF WILL EVEN IN HER SMALL FEET AS THOUGH THEY WERE
720-173582-0024 QUITE CONSCIOUS OF HER STATION THEY TROD AS UPON NECKS AND TO COMPLETE HER STATE IT IS THE CUSTOM OF HER NATION A PONIARD DECK'D HER GIRDLE AS THE SIGN SHE WAS A SULTAN'S BRIDE
720-173582-0025 THANK HEAVEN NOT MINE TO HEAR AND TO OBEY HAD BEEN FROM BIRTH THE LAW OF ALL AROUND HER TO FULFILL ALL PHANTASIES WHICH YIELDED JOY OR MIRTH HAD BEEN HER SLAVES CHIEF PLEASURE AS HER WILL
720-173582-0026 HER BLOOD WAS HIGH HER BEAUTY SCARCE OF EARTH JUDGE THEN IF HER CAPRICES E'ER STOOD STILL
720-173582-0027 THERE WAS NO END UNTO THE THINGS SHE BOUGHT NOR TO THE TROUBLE WHICH HER FANCIES CAUSED YET EVEN HER TYRANNY HAD SUCH A GRACE
