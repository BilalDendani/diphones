1931-156647-0000 YOU ARE NOT SO STUNNED AND FAINT BUT THAT I AM AS MUCH SO OR MORE AND IF I SHOULD TELL YOU THE SIMPLE TRUTH I THINK YOU WOULD NOT BE LOATH TO HEAR IT FOR IF I HAVE LENT YOU ANYTHING OF MINE
1931-156647-0001 YOU HAVE FULLY PAID ME BACK PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST FOR YOU WERE MORE READY TO PAY BACK
1931-156647-0002 BUT HOWEVER THAT MAY BE SINCE YOU WISH ME TO INFORM YOU OF MY NAME IT SHALL NOT BE KEPT FROM YOU
1931-156647-0003 AS SOON AS MY LORD YVAIN HEARD THAT HE WAS AMAZED AND SORELY TROUBLED ANGRY AND GRIEF STRICKEN HE CAST UPON THE GROUND HIS BLOODY SWORD AND BROKEN SHIELD THEN DISMOUNTED FROM HIS HORSE AND CRIED ALAS
1931-156647-0004 WHAT MISCHANCE IS THIS THROUGH WHAT UNHAPPY IGNORANCE IN NOT RECOGNISING EACH OTHER HAVE WE WAGED THIS BATTLE FOR IF I HAD KNOWN WHO YOU WERE I SHOULD NEVER HAVE FOUGHT WITH YOU BUT UPON MY WORD I SHOULD HAVE SURRENDERED WITHOUT A BLOW
1931-156647-0005 WHO ARE YOU THEN I AM YVAIN WHO LOVE YOU MORE THAN ANY MAN IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD FOR YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FOND OF ME AND SHOWN ME HONOUR IN EVERY COURT BUT I WISH TO MAKE YOU SUCH AMENDS AND DO YOU SUCH HONOUR IN THIS AFFAIR
1931-156647-0006 THAT I WILL CONFESS MYSELF TO HAVE BEEN DEFEATED WILL YOU DO SO MUCH FOR MY SAKE
1931-156647-0007 SURELY I SHOULD BE PRESUMPTUOUS TO ACCEPT ANY SUCH AMENDS FROM YOU THIS HONOUR SHALL NEVER BE CLAIMED AS MINE BUT IT SHALL BE YOURS TO WHOM I RESIGN IT AH FAIR SIRE DO NOT SPEAK SO FOR THAT COULD NEVER BE
1931-156647-0008 I AM SO WOUNDED AND EXHAUSTED THAT I CANNOT ENDURE MORE SURELY YOU HAVE NO CAUSE TO BE CONCERNED HIS FRIEND AND COMPANION REPLIES BUT FOR MY PART I AM DEFEATED AND OVERCOME
1931-156647-0009 I SAY IT NOT AS A COMPLIMENT FOR THERE IS NO STRANGER IN THE WORLD TO WHOM I WOULD NOT SAY AS MUCH RATHER THAN RECEIVE ANY MORE BLOWS THUS SAYING HE GOT DOWN FROM HIS HORSE AND THEY THREW THEIR ARMS ABOUT EACH OTHER'S NECK KISSING EACH OTHER
1931-156647-0010 THE ARGUMENT IS STILL IN PROGRESS WHEN THE KING AND THE KNIGHTS COME RUNNING UP FROM EVERY SIDE AT THE SIGHT OF THEIR RECONCILIATION AND GREAT IS THEIR DESIRE TO HEAR HOW THIS CAN BE AND WHO THESE MEN ARE WHO MANIFEST SUCH HAPPINESS
1931-156647-0011 THE KING SAYS GENTLEMEN TELL US NOW WHO IT IS THAT HAS SO SUDDENLY BROUGHT ABOUT THIS FRIENDSHIP AND HARMONY BETWEEN YOU TWO AFTER THE HATRED AND STRIFE THERE HAS BEEN THIS DAY THEN HIS NEPHEW
1931-156647-0012 MY LORD YOU SHALL BE INFORMED OF THE MISFORTUNE AND MISCHANCE WHICH HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF OUR STRIFE
1931-156647-0013 WHO AM YOUR NEPHEW DID NOT RECOGNISE THIS COMPANION OF MINE MY LORD YVAIN UNTIL HE FORTUNATELY BY THE WILL OF GOD ASKED ME MY NAME AFTER EACH HAD INFORMED THE OTHER OF HIS NAME
1931-156647-0014 WE RECOGNISED EACH OTHER BUT NOT UNTIL WE HAD FOUGHT IT OUT OUR STRUGGLE ALREADY HAS BEEN LONG
1931-156647-0015 IT WOULD HAVE FARED ILL WITH ME FOR BY MY HEAD HE WOULD HAVE KILLED ME WHAT WITH HIS PROWESS AND THE EVIL CAUSE OF HER WHO CHOSE ME AS HER CHAMPION BUT I WOULD RATHER BE DEFEATED THAN KILLED BY A FRIEND IN BATTLE
1931-156647-0016 THEN MY LORD YVAIN'S BLOOD WAS STIRRED AS HE SAID TO HIM IN REPLY FAIR DEAR SIRE SO HELP ME GOD YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY SO MUCH LET MY LORD THE KING
1931-156647-0017 WELL KNOW IN THIS BATTLE I AM SURELY THE ONE WHO HAS BEEN DEFEATED AND OVERCOME I AM THE ONE NO I AM THUS EACH CRIES OUT AND BOTH ARE SO HONEST AND COURTEOUS
1931-156647-0018 THAT EACH ALLOWS THE VICTORY AND CROWN TO BE THE OTHER'S PRIZE WHILE NEITHER ONE OF THEM WILL ACCEPT IT
1931-156647-0019 THAT HE HAS BEEN DEFEATED AND OVERTHROWN BUT WHEN HE HAD LISTENED TO THEM FOR A WHILE THE KING TERMINATED THE DISPUTE HE WAS WELL PLEASED WITH WHAT HE HEARD AND WITH THE SIGHT OF THEM IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS
1931-156647-0020 THOUGH THEY HAD WOUNDED AND INJURED EACH OTHER IN SEVERAL PLACES MY LORDS HE SAYS THERE IS DEEP AFFECTION BETWEEN YOU TWO YOU GIVE CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THAT WHEN EACH INSISTS THAT IT IS HE WHO HAS BEEN DEFEATED NOW LEAVE IT ALL TO ME
1931-156647-0021 THEN THEY BOTH PROMISED HIM THAT THEY WOULD DO HIS WILL IN EVERY PARTICULAR AND THE KING SAYS THAT HE WILL DECIDE THE QUARREL FAIRLY AND FAITHFULLY WHERE IS THE DAMSEL HE INQUIRES
1931-156647-0022 MY LORD SHE ANSWERS HERE I AM ARE YOU THERE THEN DRAW NEAR TO ME I SAW PLAINLY SOME TIME AGO THAT YOU WERE DISINHERITING HER BUT HER RIGHT SHALL NO LONGER BE DENIED FOR YOU YOURSELF HAVE AVOWED THE TRUTH TO ME
1931-156647-0023 YOU MUST NOW RESIGN HER SHARE TO HER SIRE SHE SAYS IF I UTTERED A FOOLISH AND THOUGHTLESS WORD YOU OUGHT NOT TO TAKE ME UP IN IT FOR GOD'S SAKE SIRE DO NOT BE HARD ON ME YOU ARE A KING
1931-156647-0024 AND YOU OUGHT TO GUARD AGAINST WRONG AND ERROR THE KING REPLIES THAT IS PRECISELY WHY I WISH TO GIVE YOUR SISTER HER RIGHTS FOR I HAVE NEVER DEFENDED WHAT IS WRONG
1931-156647-0025 AND YOU HAVE SURELY HEARD HOW YOUR KNIGHT AND HERS HAVE LEFT THE MATTER IN MY HANDS I SHALL NOT SAY WHAT IS ALTOGETHER PLEASING TO YOU FOR YOUR INJUSTICE IS WELL KNOWN IN HIS DESIRE TO HONOUR THE OTHER
1931-156647-0026 EACH ONE SAYS THAT HE HAS BEEN DEFEATED BUT THERE IS NO NEED TO DELAY FURTHER SINCE THE MATTER HAS BEEN LEFT TO ME EITHER YOU WILL DO IN ALL RESPECTS WHAT I SAY WITHOUT RESISTANCE OR I SHALL ANNOUNCE THAT MY NEPHEW HAS BEEN DEFEATED IN THE FIGHT
1931-156647-0027 AND I SHALL BE SORRY TO MAKE SUCH A DECLARATION IN REALITY HE WOULD NOT HAVE SAID IT FOR ANYTHING BUT HE SPOKE THUS IN ORDER TO SEE IF HE COULD FRIGHTEN HER INTO RESTORING THE HERITAGE TO HER SISTER
1931-156647-0028 FOR HE CLEARLY SAW THAT SHE NEVER WOULD SURRENDER ANYTHING TO HER FOR ANY WORDS OF HIS UNLESS SHE WAS INFLUENCED BY FORCE OR FEAR IN FEAR AND APPREHENSION SHE REPLIED TO HIM FAIR LORD I MUST NOW RESPECT YOUR DESIRE
1931-156647-0029 THOUGH MY HEART IS VERY LOATH TO YIELD YET HOWEVER HARD IT MAY GO WITH ME I SHALL DO IT AND MY SISTER SHALL HAVE WHAT BELONGS TO HER I GIVE HER YOUR OWN PERSON AS A PLEDGE OF HER SHARE IN MY INHERITANCE
1931-156647-0030 IN ORDER THAT SHE MAY BE MORE ASSURED OF IT ENDOW HER WITH IT THEN AT ONCE THE KING REPLIES LET HER RECEIVE IT FROM YOUR HANDS AND LET HER VOW FIDELITY TO YOU DO YOU LOVE HER AS YOUR VASSAL
1931-156647-0031 AND LET HER LOVE YOU AS HER SOVEREIGN LADY AND AS HER SISTER THUS THE KING CONDUCTS THE AFFAIR UNTIL THE DAMSEL TAKES POSSESSION OF HER LAND AND OFFERS HER THANKS TO HIM FOR IT
1931-156647-0032 THEN THE KING ASKED THE VALIANT AND BRAVE KNIGHT WHO WAS HIS NEPHEW TO ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE DISARMED AND HE REQUESTED MY LORD YVAIN TO LAY ASIDE HIS ARMS ALSO FOR NOW THEY MAY WELL DISPENSE WITH THEM
1931-156647-0033 THEN THE TWO VASSALS LAY ASIDE THEIR ARMS AND SEPARATE ON EQUAL TERMS AND WHILE THEY ARE TAKING OFF THEIR ARMOUR THEY SEE THE LION RUNNING UP IN SEARCH OF HIS MASTER AS SOON AS HE CATCHES SIGHT OF HIM HE BEGINS TO SHOW HIS JOY
1931-156647-0034 MY LORD YVAIN CRIES OUT STAND STILL ALL WHY DO YOU FLEE NO ONE IS CHASING YOU HAVE NO FEAR THAT YONDER LION WILL DO YOU HARM BELIEVE ME PLEASE WHEN I SAY THAT HE IS MINE AND I AM HIS
1931-156647-0035 AND WE ARE BOTH COMPANIONS
1931-156647-0036 THAT THIS MUST BE THE VERY MAN WHO HAD KILLED THE WICKED GIANT
1931-156647-0037 I DID NOT DESERVE THE SERVICE THAT YOU DID ME
1931-156647-0038 I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU FOR SOME TIME AND I WAS TROUBLED BECAUSE IT WAS SAID THAT WE WERE ACQUAINTED AS LOVING FRIENDS I HAVE SURELY THOUGHT MUCH UPON THE SUBJECT BUT I COULD NOT HIT UPON THE TRUTH
1931-156647-0039 AND HAD NEVER HEARD OF ANY KNIGHT THAT I HAD KNOWN IN ANY LAND WHERE I HAD BEEN WHO WAS CALLED THE KNIGHT WITH THE LION
1931-156647-0040 AND SHOWED SUCH JOY AS A DUMB BEAST COULD THEN THE TWO KNIGHTS HAD TO BE REMOVED TO A SICK ROOM AND INFIRMARY FOR THEY NEEDED A DOCTOR AND PIASTER TO CURE THEIR WOUNDS KING ARTHUR
1931-156647-0041 WHO LOVED THEM WELL HAD THEM BOTH BROUGHT BEFORE HIM AND SUMMONED A SURGEON WHOSE KNOWLEDGE OF SURGERY WAS SUPREME
1931-156647-0042 FOR IT SEEMED AS IF THE WHOLE FOREST MUST SURELY BE ENGULFED THE LADY FEARS FOR HER TOWN LEST IT TOO WILL CRUMBLE AWAY THE WALLS TOTTER AND THE TOWER ROCKS SO THAT IT IS ON THE VERGE OF FALLING DOWN
1931-156647-0043 THE BRAVEST TURK WOULD RATHER BE A CAPTIVE IN PERSIA THAN BE SHUT UP WITHIN THOSE WALLS THE PEOPLE ARE SO STRICKEN WITH TERROR THAT THEY CURSE ALL THEIR ANCESTORS SAYING
1931-156647-0044 AND ALL THOSE WHO BUILT THIS TOWN
1931-156647-0045 UNLESS YOU SEEK FOR HIM AFAR IN THE FUTURE WE SHALL NEVER BE SECURE IN THIS TOWN NOR DARE TO PASS BEYOND THE WALLS AND GATE YOU KNOW FULL WELL THAT WERE SOME ONE TO SUMMON TOGETHER ALL YOUR KNIGHTS FOR THIS CAUSE
1931-156647-0046 THE BEST OF THEM WOULD NOT DARE TO STEP FORWARD IF IT IS TRUE THAT YOU HAVE NO ONE TO DEFEND YOUR SPRING YOU WILL APPEAR RIDICULOUS AND HUMILIATED
1931-156647-0047 IF HE WHO HAS ATTACKED YOU SHALL RETIRE WITHOUT A FIGHT SURELY YOU ARE IN A BAD PREDICAMENT IF YOU DO NOT DEVISE SOME OTHER PLAN TO BENEFIT YOURSELF THE LADY REPLIES DO THOU WHO ART SO WISE
1931-156647-0048 TELL ME WHAT PLAN I CAN DEVISE AND I WILL FOLLOW THY ADVICE INDEED LADY IF I HAD ANY PLAN I SHOULD GLADLY PROPOSE IT TO YOU BUT YOU HAVE GREAT NEED OF A WISER COUNSELLOR
1931-156647-0049 SO I SHALL CERTAINLY NOT DARE TO INTRUDE AND IN COMMON WITH THE OTHERS I SHALL ENDURE THE RAIN AND WIND UNTIL IF IT PLEASE GOD
1931-156647-0050 BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN TO DAY AND WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN THE WORST OF YOUR URGENT NEED THEN THE LADY REPLIES AT ONCE DAMSEL SPEAK NOW OF SOMETHING ELSE SAY NO MORE OF THE PEOPLE OF MY HOUSEHOLD
1931-156647-0051 FOR I CHERISH NO FURTHER EXPECTATION THAT THE SPRING AND ITS MARBLE BRIM WILL EVER BE DEFENDED BY ANY OF THEM BUT IF IT PLEASE GOD LET US HEAR NOW WHAT IS YOUR OPINION AND PLAN FOR PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY THAT IN TIME OF NEED
1931-156647-0052 AND DEFEATED THE THREE KNIGHTS HE WOULD DO WELL TO GO TO SEARCH FOR HIM BUT SO LONG AS HE SHALL INCUR THE ENMITY WRATH AND DISPLEASURE OF HIS LADY I FANCY THERE IS NOT UNDER HEAVEN ANY MAN OR WOMAN WHOM HE WOULD FOLLOW
1931-156647-0053 UNTIL HE HAD BEEN ASSURED UPON OATH THAT EVERYTHING POSSIBLE WOULD BE DONE TO APPEASE THE HOSTILITY WHICH HIS LADY FEELS FOR HIM AND WHICH IS SO BITTER THAT HE IS DYING OF THE GRIEF AND ANXIETY IT CAUSES HIM AND THE LADY SAID
1931-156647-0054 BEFORE YOU ENTER UPON THE QUEST I AM PREPARED TO PROMISE YOU UPON MY WORD AND TO SWEAR THAT IF HE WILL RETURN TO ME I WILL OPENLY AND FRANKLY DO ALL I CAN TO BRING ABOUT HIS PEACE OF MIND
1931-156647-0055 THEN LUNETE REPLIES TO HER LADY HAVE NO FEAR THAT YOU CANNOT EASILY EFFECT HIS RECONCILIATION WHEN ONCE IT IS YOUR DESIRE TO DO SO
1931-156647-0056 I HAVE NO OBJECTION THE LADY SAYS WITH DELICATE COURTESY LUNETE PROCURED AT ONCE FOR HER A VERY PRECIOUS RELIC AND THE LADY FELL UPON HER KNEES THUS LUNETE VERY COURTEOUSLY ACCEPTED HER UPON HER OATH
1931-156647-0057 IN ADMINISTERING THE OATH SHE FORGOT NOTHING WHICH IT MIGHT BE AN ADVANTAGE TO INSERT LADY SHE SAYS NOW RAISE YOUR HAND I DO NOT WISH THAT THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW YOU SHOULD LAY ANY CHARGE UPON ME
1931-156647-0058 FOR YOU ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING FOR ME BUT YOU ARE ACTING FOR YOUR OWN GOOD IF YOU PLEASE NOW YOU SHALL SWEAR THAT YOU WILL EXERT YOURSELF IN THE INTERESTS OF THE KNIGHT WITH THE LION
1931-156647-0059 AS COMPLETELY AS HE EVER POSSESSED IT THE LADY THEN RAISED HER RIGHT HAND AND SAID I SWEAR TO ALL THAT THOU HAST SAID SO HELP ME GOD AND HIS HOLY SAINT
1931-156647-0060 AND IN A HAPPY FRAME OF MIND LUNETE MOUNTS AND RIDES AWAY UNTIL SHE FINDS BENEATH THE PINE TREE
1931-156647-0061 SHE HAD THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO SEEK AFAR BEFORE DISCOVERING HIM AS SOON AS SHE SAW HIM SHE RECOGNISED HIM BY THE LION AND COMING TOWARD HIM RAPIDLY SHE DISMOUNTED UPON THE SOLID EARTH
1931-156647-0062 AND MY LORD YVAIN RECOGNISED HER AS SOON AS HE SAW HER AND GREETED HER AS SHE SALUTED HIM WITH THE WORDS SIRE
1931-156647-0063 HOW IS THAT WERE YOU LOOKING FOR ME THEN YES SIRE AND IN ALL MY LIFE I HAVE NEVER FELT SO GLAD FOR I HAVE MADE MY MISTRESS PROMISE IF SHE DOES NOT GO BACK UPON HER WORD
1931-156647-0064 THAT SHE WILL BE AGAIN YOUR LADY AS WAS ONCE THE CASE AND THAT YOU SHALL BE HER LORD THIS TRUTH I MAKE BOLD TO TELL MY LORD YVAIN WAS GREATLY ELATED AT THE NEWS HE HEARS AND WHICH HE HAD NEVER EXPECTED TO HEAR AGAIN
1931-156647-0065 HE COULD NOT SUFFICIENTLY SHOW HIS GRATITUDE TO HER WHO HAD ACCOMPLISHED THIS FOR HIM HE KISSES HER EYES AND THEN HER FACE SAYING SURELY MY SWEET FRIEND I CAN NEVER REPAY YOU FOR THIS SERVICE
1931-156647-0066 I FEAR THAT ABILITY AND TIME WILL FAIL ME TO DO YOU THE HONOUR AND SERVICE WHICH IS YOUR DUE SIRE SHE REPLIES HAVE NO CONCERN AND LET NOT THAT THOUGHT WORRY YOU
1931-156647-0067 FOR YOU WILL HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF STRENGTH AND TIME TO SHOW ME AND OTHERS YOUR GOOD WILL IF I HAVE PAID THIS DEBT I OWED I AM ENTITLED TO ONLY SO MUCH GRATITUDE AS THE MAN WHO BORROWS ANOTHER'S GOODS AND THEN DISCHARGES THE OBLIGATION
1931-156647-0068 EVEN NOW I DO NOT CONSIDER THAT I HAVE PAID YOU THE DEBT I OWED INDEED YOU HAVE AS GOD SEES ME
1931-156647-0069 WHOM SHE WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO MEET AND KNOW AND SEE ALL CLAD IN HIS ARMS MY LORD YVAIN FELL AT HER FEET UPON HIS KNEES WHILE LUNETE WHO WAS STANDING BY SAID TO HER RAISE HIM UP LADY
1931-156647-0070 AND APPLY ALL YOUR EFFORTS AND STRENGTH AND SKILL IN PROCURING THAT PEACE AND PARDON WHICH NO ONE IN THE WORLD EXCEPT YOU CAN SECURE FOR HIM THEN THE LADY BADE HIM RISE AND SAID HE MAY DISPOSE OF ALL MY POWER
1931-156647-0071 I SHALL BE VERY HAPPY IF POSSIBLE TO ACCOMPLISH HIS WISH AND HIS DESIRE SURELY MY LADY LUNETE REPLIED I WOULD NOT SAY IT IF IT WERE NOT TRUE BUT ALL THIS IS EVEN MORE POSSIBLE FOR YOU THAN I HAVE SAID
1931-156647-0072 BUT NOW I WILL TELL YOU THE WHOLE TRUTH AND YOU SHALL SEE YOU NEVER HAD AND YOU NEVER WILL HAVE SUCH A GOOD FRIEND AS THIS GENTLEMAN GOD WHOSE WILL IT IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE UNENDING PEACE AND LOVE BETWEEN YOU AND HIM
1931-156647-0073 HAS CAUSED ME TO FIND HIM THIS DAY SO NEAR AT HAND IN ORDER TO TEST THE TRUTH OF THIS
1931-156647-0074 AND A CHARMING WAY OF SERVING ME I WOULD RATHER ENDURE THE WINDS AND THE TEMPESTS ALL MY LIFE AND IF IT WERE NOT A MEAN AND UGLY THING TO BREAK ONE'S WORD HE WOULD NEVER MAKE HIS PEACE
1931-156647-0075 AND DEARLY TO PAY FOR MY MAD ACT IT WAS MADNESS THAT MADE ME STAY AWAY AND I NOW ADMIT MY GUILT AND SIN I HAVE BEEN BOLD INDEED IN DARING TO PRESENT MYSELF TO YOU BUT IF YOU WILL DEIGN TO KEEP ME NOW
1931-156647-0076 I NEVER AGAIN SHALL DO YOU ANY WRONG SHE REPLIED I WILL SURELY CONSENT TO THAT FOR IF I DID NOT DO ALL I COULD TO ESTABLISH PEACE BETWEEN YOU AND ME I SHOULD BE GUILTY OF PERJURY SO IF YOU PLEASE
1931-156647-0077 FOR HE IS BELOVED AND TREASURED BY HIS LADY AND SHE BY HIM
