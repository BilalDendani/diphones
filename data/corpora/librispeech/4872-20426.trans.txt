4872-20426-0000 ONE IS THAT THE SPECTACLES FOUND BY US AT KENNINGTON LANE WERE UNDOUBTEDLY JEFFREY'S
4872-20426-0001 AS THAT THERE EXISTS ANOTHER FACE EXACTLY LIKE JEFFREY'S FACE THE SECOND FACT IS THAT THE DESCRIPTION OF JEFFREY TALLIES COMPLETELY WITH THAT OF THE SICK MAN GRAVES AS GIVEN BY DOCTOR JERVIS AND THE THIRD IS THAT WHEN JEFFREY WAS SEEN BY MISTER HINDLEY
4872-20426-0002 THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HIS BEING ADDICTED TO THE TAKING OF MORPHINE THE FIRST AND SECOND FACTS YOU WILL AGREE CONSTITUTE COMPLETE IDENTIFICATION YES SAID MARCHMONT I THINK WE MUST ADMIT THE IDENTIFICATION AS BEING QUITE CONCLUSIVE
4872-20426-0003 THOUGH THE EVIDENCE IS OF A KIND THAT IS MORE STRIKING
4872-20426-0004 YOU WILL NOT HAVE THAT COMPLAINT TO MAKE AGAINST THE NEXT ITEM OF EVIDENCE SAID THORNDYKE IT IS AFTER THE LAWYER'S OWN HEART AS YOU SHALL HEAR A FEW DAYS AGO I WROTE TO MISTER STEPHEN ASKING HIM
4872-20426-0005 IF HE POSSESSED A RECENT PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS UNCLE JEFFREY HE HAD ONE AND HE SENT IT TO ME BY RETURN THIS PORTRAIT I SHOWED TO DOCTOR JERVIS AND ASKED HIM IF HE HAD EVER SEEN THE PERSON IT REPRESENTED AFTER EXAMINING IT ATTENTIVELY
4872-20426-0006 WITHOUT ANY HINT WHATEVER FROM ME HE IDENTIFIED IT AS THE PORTRAIT OF THE SICK MAN GRAVES INDEED EXCLAIMED MARCHMONT THIS IS MOST IMPORTANT
4872-20426-0007 I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT I REPLIED THAT THE PORTRAIT IS THAT OF MISTER GRAVES EXCELLENT SAID MARCHMONT RUBBING HIS HANDS GLEEFULLY THIS WILL BE MUCH MORE CONVINCING TO A JURY PRAY GO ON DOCTOR THORNDYKE
4872-20426-0008 THAT SAID THORNDYKE COMPLETES THE FIRST PART OF MY INVESTIGATION WE HAD NOW REACHED A DEFINITE DEMONSTRABLE FACT AND THAT FACT AS YOU SEE DISPOSED AT ONCE OF THE MAIN QUESTION THE GENUINENESS OF THE WILL
4872-20426-0009 FOR IF THE MAN AT KENNINGTON LANE WAS JEFFREY BLACKMORE THEN THE MAN AT NEW INN WAS NOT BUT IT WAS THE LATTER WHO HAD SIGNED THE WILL THEREFORE THE WILL WAS NOT SIGNED BY JEFFREY BLACKMORE THAT IS TO SAY IT WAS A FORGERY
4872-20426-0010 THE CASE WAS COMPLETE FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE CIVIL PROCEEDINGS THE REST OF MY INVESTIGATIONS HAD REFERENCE TO THE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION THAT WAS INEVITABLE SHALL I PROCEED OR IS YOUR INTEREST CONFINED TO THE WILL HANG THE WILL EXCLAIMED STEPHEN
4872-20426-0011 I THINK THERE IS NO DOUBT OF IT REPLIED THORNDYKE THEN SAID MARCHMONT WE WILL HEAR THE REST OF THE ARGUMENT IF YOU PLEASE VERY WELL SAID THORNDYKE AS THE EVIDENCE STANDS WE HAVE PROVED THAT JEFFREY BLACKMORE
4872-20426-0012 WAS A PRISONER IN THE HOUSE IN KENNINGTON LANE AND THAT SOME ONE WAS PERSONATING HIM AT NEW INN THAT SOME ONE WE HAVE SEEN WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY JOHN BLACKMORE
4872-20426-0013 WE MAY NOTE IN PASSING THAT WEISS AND THE COACHMAN WERE APPARENTLY ONE AND THE SAME PERSON THEY WERE NEVER SEEN TOGETHER WHEN WEISS WAS PRESENT THE COACHMAN WAS NOT AVAILABLE EVEN FOR SO URGENT A SERVICE AS THE OBTAINING OF AN ANTIDOTE TO THE POISON
4872-20426-0014 WEISS ALWAYS APPEARED SOME TIME AFTER JERVIS'S ARRIVAL AND DISAPPEARED SOME TIME BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE IN EACH CASE SUFFICIENTLY LONG TO ALLOW OF A CHANGE OF DISGUISE BUT WE NEED NOT LABOUR THE POINT
4872-20426-0015 AS IT IS NOT OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE TO RETURN TO WEISS HE WAS CLEARLY HEAVILY DISGUISED AS WE SEE BY HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO SHOW HIMSELF EVEN BY THE LIGHT OF A CANDLE BUT THERE IS AN ITEM OF POSITIVE EVIDENCE ON THIS POINT
4872-20426-0016 THESE SPECTACLES HAD VERY PECULIAR OPTICAL PROPERTIES WHEN YOU LOOKED THROUGH THEM THEY HAD THE PROPERTIES OF PLAIN GLASS WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THEM THEY HAD THE APPEARANCE OF LENSES BUT ONLY ONE KIND OF GLASS POSSESSES THESE PROPERTIES
4872-20426-0017 NAMELY THAT WHICH LIKE AN ORDINARY WATCH GLASS HAS CURVED PARALLEL SURFACES BUT FOR WHAT PURPOSE COULD A PERSON WEAR WATCH GLASS SPECTACLES CLEARLY NOT TO ASSIST HIS VISION THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE IS DISGUISE
4872-20426-0018 TO A PERSON OF NORMAL EYESIGHT IT IS NOTHING OF THE KIND FOR IF HE WEARS SPECTACLES SUITED FOR LONG SIGHT HE CANNOT SEE DISTINCTLY THROUGH THEM AT ALL WHILE IF HE WEARS CONCAVE OR NEAR SIGHT GLASSES THE EFFORT TO SEE THROUGH THEM
4872-20426-0019 ON THE STAGE THE DIFFICULTY IS MET BY USING SPECTACLES OF PLAIN WINDOW GLASS BUT IN REAL LIFE THIS WOULD HARDLY DO THE PROPERTY SPECTACLES WOULD BE DETECTED AT ONCE AND GIVE RISE TO SUSPICION THE PERSONATOR
4872-20426-0020 IS THEREFORE IN THIS DILEMMA IF HE WEARS ACTUAL SPECTACLES HE CANNOT SEE THROUGH THEM IF HE WEARS SHAM SPECTACLES OF PLAIN GLASS HIS DISGUISE WILL PROBABLY BE DETECTED THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY AND THAT NOT A VERY SATISFACTORY ONE
4872-20426-0021 IN LIEU OF A BETTER IT IS THAT OF USING WATCH GLASS SPECTACLES SUCH AS I HAVE DESCRIBED
4872-20426-0022 IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY CONFIRM OUR OPINION THAT WEISS WAS WEARING A DISGUISE BUT
4872-20426-0023 THE SECOND INFERENCE IS THEN THAT THESE SPECTACLES WERE PREPARED TO BE WORN UNDER MORE TRYING CONDITIONS OF LIGHT OUT OF DOORS FOR INSTANCE THE THIRD INFERENCE IS THAT WEISS WAS A MAN WITH NORMAL EYESIGHT FOR OTHERWISE HE COULD HAVE WORN REAL SPECTACLES
4872-20426-0024 SUITED TO THE STATE OF HIS VISION THESE ARE INFERENCES BY THE WAY TO WHICH WE MAY RETURN BUT THESE GLASSES FURNISH A MUCH MORE IMPORTANT SUGGESTION ON THE FLOOR OF THE BEDROOM AT NEW INN I FOUND SOME FRAGMENTS OF GLASS WHICH HAD BEEN TRODDEN ON
4872-20426-0025 BY JOINING ONE OR TWO OF THEM TOGETHER WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE OUT THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE OBJECT OF WHICH THEY FORMED PARTS MY ASSISTANT WHO WAS FORMERLY A WATCH MAKER JUDGED THAT OBJECT TO BE THE THIN CRYSTAL GLASS OF A LADY'S WATCH
4872-20426-0026 FURNISHES PROOF IN TWO RESPECTS THAT THIS WAS NOT A WATCH GLASS IN THE FIRST PLACE
4872-20426-0027 I FOUND THAT ITS CURVE WAS PART OF AN ELLIPSE BUT WATCH GLASSES NOWADAYS ARE INVARIABLY CIRCULAR IN THE SECOND PLACE WATCH GLASSES ARE GROUND ON THE EDGE TO A SINGLE BEVEL TO SNAP INTO THE BEZEL OR FRAME BUT THE EDGE OF THIS OBJECT
4872-20426-0028 WAS GROUND TO A DOUBLE BEVEL LIKE THE EDGE OF A SPECTACLE GLASS WHICH FITS INTO A GROOVE IN THE FRAME
4872-20426-0029 WAS THAT THIS WAS A SPECTACLE GLASS BUT IF SO IT WAS PART OF A PAIR OF SPECTACLES IDENTICAL IN PROPERTIES WITH THOSE WORN BY MISTER WEISS THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS CONCLUSION EMERGES WHEN WE CONSIDER THE EXCEPTIONAL CHARACTER
4872-20426-0030 OF MISTER WEISS'S SPECTACLES THEY WERE NOT MERELY PECULIAR OR REMARKABLE THEY WERE PROBABLY UNIQUE IT IS EXCEEDINGLY LIKELY THAT THERE IS NOT IN THE ENTIRE WORLD ANOTHER SIMILAR PAIR OF SPECTACLES
4872-20426-0031 WHENCE THE FINDING OF THESE FRAGMENTS OF GLASS IN THE BEDROOM ESTABLISHES A CONSIDERABLE PROBABILITY THAT MISTER WEISS WAS AT SOME TIME IN THE CHAMBERS AT NEW INN AND NOW LET US GATHER UP THE THREADS OF THIS PART OF THE ARGUMENT
4872-20426-0032 WHO WAS HE IN THE FIRST PLACE WE FIND HIM COMMITTING A SECRET CRIME FROM WHICH JOHN BLACKMORE ALONE WILL BENEFIT THIS SUGGESTS
4872-20426-0033 THAT HE WAS JOHN BLACKMORE THEN WE FIND THAT HE WAS A MAN OF NORMAL EYESIGHT WHO WAS WEARING SPECTACLES FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISGUISE BUT THE TENANT OF NEW INN
4872-20426-0034 AND WHOM WE WILL FOR THE PRESENT ASSUME TO HAVE BEEN JOHN BLACKMORE WAS A MAN WITH NORMAL EYESIGHT WHO WORE SPECTACLES FOR DISGUISE JOHN BLACKMORE DID NOT RESIDE AT NEW INN
4872-20426-0035 BUT WEISS RESIDED AT A PLACE WITHIN EASY REACH OF NEW INN JOHN BLACKMORE MUST HAVE HAD POSSESSION AND CONTROL OF THE PERSON OF JEFFREY BUT WEISS HAD POSSESSION AND CONTROL OF THE PERSON OF JEFFREY
4872-20426-0036 WEISS WORE SPECTACLES OF A CERTAIN PECULIAR AND PROBABLY UNIQUE CHARACTER BUT PORTIONS OF SUCH SPECTACLES WERE FOUND IN THE CHAMBERS AT NEW INN THE OVERWHELMING PROBABILITY THEREFORE IS THAT WEISS AND THE TENANT OF NEW INN
4872-20426-0037 WERE ONE AND THE SAME PERSON AND THAT THAT PERSON WAS JOHN BLACKMORE THAT SAID MISTER WINWOOD IS A VERY PLAUSIBLE ARGUMENT BUT YOU OBSERVE SIR THAT IT CONTAINS AN UNDISTRIBUTED MIDDLE TERM
4872-20426-0038 THORNDYKE SMILED GENIALLY I THINK HE FORGAVE WINWOOD EVERYTHING FOR THAT REMARK YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT SIR HE SAID IT DOES AND FOR THAT REASON THE DEMONSTRATION IS NOT ABSOLUTE BUT WE MUST NOT FORGET
4872-20426-0039 WHAT LOGICIANS SEEM OCCASIONALLY TO OVERLOOK THAT THE UNDISTRIBUTED MIDDLE WHILE IT INTERFERES WITH ABSOLUTE PROOF MAY BE QUITE CONSISTENT WITH A DEGREE OF PROBABILITY THAT APPROACHES VERY NEAR TO CERTAINTY BOTH THE BERTILLON SYSTEM
4872-20426-0040 AND THE ENGLISH FINGERPRINT SYSTEM INVOLVE A PROCESS OF REASONING IN WHICH THE MIDDLE TERM IS UNDISTRIBUTED BUT THE GREAT PROBABILITIES ARE ACCEPTED IN PRACTICE AS EQUIVALENT TO CERTAINTIES MISTER WINWOOD GRUNTED A GRUDGING ASSENT
4872-20426-0041 WE HAVE PROVED THAT THE SICK MAN GRAVES WAS JEFFREY BLACKMORE THAT THE TENANT OF NEW INN WAS JOHN BLACKMORE AND THAT THE MAN WEISS WAS ALSO JOHN BLACKMORE WE NOW HAVE TO PROVE THAT JOHN AND JEFFREY WERE TOGETHER IN THE CHAMBERS AT NEW INN ON THE NIGHT OF JEFFREY'S DEATH
4872-20426-0042 WE KNOW THAT TWO PERSONS AND TWO PERSONS ONLY CAME FROM KENNINGTON LANE TO NEW INN BUT ONE OF THOSE PERSONS WAS THE TENANT OF NEW INN THAT IS JOHN BLACKMORE WHO WAS THE OTHER
4872-20426-0043 JEFFREY IS KNOWN BY US TO HAVE BEEN AT KENNINGTON LANE HIS BODY WAS FOUND ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING IN THE ROOM AT NEW INN NO THIRD PERSON
4872-20426-0044 NO THIRD PERSON IS KNOWN TO HAVE ARRIVED AT NEW INN THE INFERENCE BY EXCLUSION IS THAT THE SECOND PERSON THE WOMAN WAS JEFFREY
4872-20426-0045 BUT JOHN WAS PERSONATING JEFFREY AND WAS MADE UP TO RESEMBLE HIM VERY CLOSELY IF JEFFREY WERE UNDISGUISED THE TWO MEN WOULD BE ALMOST EXACTLY ALIKE WHICH WOULD BE VERY NOTICEABLE IN ANY CASE AND SUSPICIOUS AFTER THE DEATH OF ONE OF THEM THEREFORE
4872-20426-0046 JEFFREY WOULD HAVE TO BE DISGUISED IN SOME WAY AND WHAT DISGUISE COULD BE SIMPLER AND MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE ONE THAT I SUGGEST WAS USED AGAIN IT WAS UNAVOIDABLE THAT SOME ONE THE CABMAN SHOULD KNOW THAT JEFFREY WAS NOT ALONE WHEN HE CAME TO THE INN THAT NIGHT
4872-20426-0047 IF THE FACT HAD LEAKED OUT AND IT HAD BECOME KNOWN THAT A MAN HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM TO HIS CHAMBERS SOME SUSPICION MIGHT HAVE ARISEN
4872-20426-0048 WHO WAS DIRECTLY INTERESTED IN HIS BROTHER'S DEATH BUT IF IT HAD TRANSPIRED THAT JEFFREY WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A WOMAN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS SUSPICION AND THAT SUSPICION WOULD NOT HAVE POINTED TO JOHN BLACKMORE THUS ALL THE GENERAL PROBABILITIES ARE IN FAVOUR
4872-20426-0049 OF THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THIS WOMAN WAS JEFFREY BLACKMORE THERE IS HOWEVER AN ITEM OF POSITIVE EVIDENCE THAT STRONGLY SUPPORTS THIS VIEW WHEN I EXAMINED THE CLOTHING OF THE DECEASED I FOUND ON THE TROUSERS A HORIZONTAL CREASE ON EACH LEG
4872-20426-0050 AS IF THE TROUSERS HAD BEEN TURNED UP HALF WAY TO THE KNEES THIS APPEARANCE IS QUITE UNDERSTANDABLE IF WE SUPPOSE THAT THE TROUSERS WERE WORN UNDER A SKIRT AND WERE TURNED UP SO THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE ACCIDENTALLY SEEN OTHERWISE IT IS QUITE INCOMPREHENSIBLE
4872-20426-0051 IS IT NOT RATHER STRANGE SAID MARCHMONT
4872-20426-0052 I THINK NOT
4872-20426-0053 YOU HAVE HEARD JERVIS'S DESCRIPTION OF HIS CONDITION THAT OF A MERE AUTOMATON YOU KNOW THAT WITHOUT HIS SPECTACLES HE WAS PRACTICALLY BLIND AND THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE WORN THEM SINCE WE FOUND THEM AT THE HOUSE IN KENNINGTON LANE
4872-20426-0054 PROBABLY HIS HEAD WAS WRAPPED UP IN THE VEIL AND THE SKIRT AND MANTLE PUT ON AFTERWARDS BUT IN ANY CASE HIS CONDITION RENDERED HIM PRACTICALLY DEVOID OF WILL POWER THAT IS ALL THE EVIDENCE I HAVE TO PROVE THAT THE UNKNOWN WOMAN WAS JEFFREY
4872-20426-0055 IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVE BUT IT IS CONVINCING ENOUGH FOR OUR PURPOSE SEEING THAT THE CASE AGAINST JOHN BLACKMORE DOES NOT DEPEND UPON IT YOUR CASE AGAINST HIM IS ON THE CHARGE OF MURDER I PRESUME SAID STEPHEN UNDOUBTEDLY
4872-20426-0056 AND YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE SUPPOSED JEFFREY TO THE PORTER HINTING AT SUICIDE ARE NOW IMPORTANT EVIDENCE BY THE LIGHT OF WHAT WE KNOW THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF INTENDED SUICIDE BECOMES THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF INTENDED MURDER
4872-20426-0057 IT CONCLUSIVELY DISPROVES WHAT IT WAS INTENDED TO PROVE THAT JEFFREY DIED BY HIS OWN HAND YES I SEE THAT SAID STEPHEN AND THEN AFTER A PAUSE HE ASKED DID YOU IDENTIFY MISSUS SCHALLIBAUM
4872-20426-0058 YOU HAVE TOLD US NOTHING ABOUT HER I HAVE CONSIDERED HER AS BEING OUTSIDE THE CASE AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED REPLIED THORNDYKE SHE WAS AN ACCESSORY MY BUSINESS WAS WITH THE PRINCIPAL BUT OF COURSE SHE WILL BE SWEPT UP IN THE NET
4872-20426-0059 THE EVIDENCE THAT CONVICTS JOHN BLACKMORE WILL CONVICT HER I HAVE NOT TROUBLED ABOUT HER IDENTITY IF JOHN BLACKMORE IS MARRIED
4872-20426-0060 YES BUT MISSUS JOHN BLACKMORE IS NOT MUCH LIKE MISSUS SCHALLIBAUM EXCEPTING THAT SHE HAS A CAST IN THE LEFT EYE SHE IS A DARK WOMAN WITH VERY HEAVY EYEBROWS
4872-20426-0061 AND RESEMBLES HER IN THE ONE FEATURE THAT IS UNCHANGEABLE DO YOU KNOW IF HER CHRISTIAN NAME HAPPENS TO BE PAULINE YES IT IS SHE WAS A MISS PAULINE HAGENBECK A MEMBER OF AN AMERICAN THEATRICAL COMPANY WHAT MADE YOU ASK
4872-20426-0062 THE NAME WHICH JERVIS HEARD POOR JEFFREY STRUGGLING TO PRONOUNCE SEEMED TO ME TO RESEMBLE PAULINE MORE THAN ANY OTHER NAME THERE IS ONE LITTLE POINT THAT STRIKES ME SAID MARCHMONT IS IT NOT RATHER REMARKABLE THAT THE PORTER
4872-20426-0063 SHOULD HAVE NOTICED NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BODY OF JEFFREY AND THE LIVING MAN WHOM HE KNEW BY SIGHT AND WHO MUST AFTER ALL HAVE BEEN DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT IN APPEARANCE
4872-20426-0064 YOU RAISED THAT QUESTION THORNDYKE REPLIED FOR THAT VERY DIFFICULTY PRESENTED ITSELF TO ME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CASE BUT ON THINKING IT OVER I DECIDED THAT IT WAS AN IMAGINARY DIFFICULTY ASSUMING AS WE DO THAT THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE TWO MEN
4872-20426-0065 PUT YOURSELF IN THE PORTER'S PLACE AND FOLLOW HIS MENTAL PROCESSES HE IS INFORMED THAT A DEAD MAN IS LYING ON THE BED IN MISTER BLACKMORE'S ROOMS NATURALLY HE ASSUMES THAT THE DEAD MAN IS MISTER BLACKMORE WHO BY THE WAY
4872-20426-0066 IF HE NOTES ANY DIFFERENCE OF APPEARANCE
4872-20426-0067 LOOKS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THE SAME MAN ALIVE I TAKE IT AS EVIDENCE OF GREAT ACUTENESS ON THE PART OF JOHN BLACKMORE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE CALCULATED SO CLEVERLY
4872-20426-0068 BUT THE ERRONEOUS REASONING WHICH EVERY ONE WOULD BASE ON THE PORTER'S CONCLUSIONS FOR SINCE THE BODY WAS ACTUALLY JEFFREY'S AND WAS IDENTIFIED BY THE PORTER AS THAT OF HIS TENANT IT HAS BEEN ASSUMED BY EVERY ONE THAT NO QUESTION WAS POSSIBLE
4872-20426-0069 AS TO THE IDENTITY OF JEFFREY BLACKMORE
4872-20426-0070 MAY WE TAKE IT THAT WE HAVE NOW HEARD ALL THE EVIDENCE YES REPLIED THORNDYKE THAT IS MY CASE HAVE YOU GIVEN INFORMATION TO THE POLICE STEPHEN ASKED EAGERLY YES AS SOON AS I HAD OBTAINED THE STATEMENT OF THE CABMAN RIDLEY
4872-20426-0071 AND FELT THAT I HAD ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SECURE A CONVICTION I CALLED AT SCOTLAND YARD AND HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER THE CASE IS IN THE HANDS OF SUPERINTENDENT MILLER OF THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT A MOST ACUTE AND ENERGETIC OFFICER
4872-20426-0072 I HAVE BEEN EXPECTING TO HEAR THAT THE WARRANT HAS BEEN EXECUTED FOR MISTER MILLER IS USUALLY VERY PUNCTILIOUS IN KEEPING ME INFORMED OF THE PROGRESS OF THE CASES TO WHICH I INTRODUCE HIM WE SHALL HEAR TO MORROW NO DOUBT AND FOR THE PRESENT SAID MARCHMONT
4872-20426-0073 I SHALL ENTER A CAVEAT ALL THE SAME SAID MISTER WINWOOD THAT DOESN'T SEEM VERY NECESSARY MARCHMONT OBJECTED THE EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE HEARD IS AMPLY SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE A CONVICTION AND THERE WILL BE PLENTY MORE WHEN THE POLICE GO INTO THE CASE
4872-20426-0074 AND A CONVICTION ON THE CHARGES OF FORGERY AND MURDER WOULD OF COURSE INVALIDATE THE SECOND WILL I SHALL ENTER A CAVEAT ALL THE SAME REPEATED MISTER WINWOOD AS THE TWO PARTNERS SHOWED A DISPOSITION TO BECOME HEATED OVER THIS QUESTION
4872-20426-0075 THORNDYKE SUGGESTED THAT THEY MIGHT DISCUSS IT AT LEISURE BY THE LIGHT OF SUBSEQUENT EVENTS ACTING ON THIS HINT FOR IT WAS NOW CLOSE UPON MIDNIGHT OUR VISITORS PREPARED TO DEPART AND WERE IN FACT JUST MAKING THEIR WAY TOWARDS THE DOOR WHEN THE BELL RANG
4872-20426-0076 THORNDYKE FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR AND AS HE RECOGNIZED HIS VISITOR GREETED HIM WITH EVIDENT SATISFACTION HA MISTER MILLER
4872-20426-0077 THESE GENTLEMEN ARE MISTER STEPHEN BLACKMORE AND HIS SOLICITORS MISTER MARCHMONT AND MISTER WINWOOD YOU KNOW DOCTOR JERVIS I THINK THE OFFICER BOWED TO OUR FRIENDS AND REMARKED
4872-20426-0078 YOU HAVEN'T LET THAT VILLAIN ESCAPE I HOPE STEPHEN EXCLAIMED WELL
4872-20426-0079 IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND SAID THORNDYKE MOTIONING THE OFFICER TO A CHAIR
4872-20426-0080 AND FORTHWITH BEGAN HIS STORY AS SOON AS WE HAD YOUR INFORMATION WE PROCURED A WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF BOTH PARTIES AND THEN I WENT STRAIGHT TO THEIR FLAT WITH INSPECTOR BADGER AND A SERGEANT
4872-20426-0081 WE KEPT A WATCH ON THE PREMISES AND THIS MORNING ABOUT THE TIME APPOINTED
4872-20426-0082 WHICH WE DID AS FAST AS WE COULD RACE BUT THEY GOT TO THEIR LANDING FIRST AND WE WERE ONLY JUST IN TIME TO SEE THEM NIP IN AND SHUT THE DOOR HOWEVER IT SEEMED THAT WE HAD THEM SAFE ENOUGH
4872-20426-0083 SO WE SENT THE SERGEANT TO GET A LOCKSMITH TO PICK THE LOCK OR FORCE THE DOOR WHILE WE KEPT ON RINGING THE BELL ABOUT THREE MINUTES AFTER THE SERGEANT LEFT I HAPPENED TO LOOK OUT OF THE LANDING WINDOW AND SAW A HANSOM PULL UP OPPOSITE THE FLATS
4872-20426-0084 AND HANG ME IF I DIDN'T SEE OUR TWO FRIENDS GETTING INTO THE CAB IT SEEMS THAT THERE WAS A SMALL LIFT INSIDE THE FLAT COMMUNICATING WITH THE KITCHEN
4872-20426-0085 WELL OF COURSE WE RACED DOWN THE STAIRS LIKE ACROBATS BUT BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THE BOTTOM THE CAB WAS OFF WITH A FINE START WE RAN OUT INTO VICTORIA STREET AND THERE WE COULD SEE IT HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET AND GOING LIKE A CHARIOT RACE WE MANAGED TO PICK UP ANOTHER HANSOM
4872-20426-0086 AND TOLD THE CABBY TO KEEP THE OTHER ONE IN SIGHT AND AWAY WE WENT LIKE THE VERY DEUCE ALONG VICTORIA STREET AND BROAD SANCTUARY ACROSS PARLIAMENT SQUARE OVER WESTMINSTER BRIDGE AND ALONG YORK ROAD WE KEPT THE OTHER BEGGAR IN SIGHT BUT WE COULDN'T GAIN AN INCH ON HIM
4872-20426-0087 THEN WE TURNED INTO WATERLOO STATION AND AS WE WERE DRIVING UP THE SLOPE WE MET ANOTHER HANSOM COMING DOWN
4872-20426-0088 HOWEVER I TOOK A CHANCE I REMEMBERED THAT THE SOUTHAMPTON EXPRESS WAS DUE TO START ABOUT THIS TIME AND I TOOK A SHORT CUT ACROSS THE LINES AND MADE FOR THE PLATFORM THAT IT STARTS FROM
4872-20426-0089 THE MAN AND THE WOMAN MANAGED TO SCRAMBLE INTO ONE OF THE REAR COMPARTMENTS AND BADGER AND I RACED UP THE PLATFORM LIKE MAD
4872-20426-0090 AND WE BOTH SPRINTED HARDER THAN EVER AND JUST HOPPED ON THE FOOT BOARD OF THE GUARD'S VAN AS THE TRAIN BEGAN TO GET UP SPEED THE GUARD COULDN'T RISK PUTTING US OFF
4872-20426-0091 WHICH SUITED US EXACTLY AS WE COULD WATCH THE TRAIN ON BOTH SIDES FROM THE LOOK OUT AND WE DID WATCH I CAN TELL YOU FOR OUR FRIEND IN FRONT HAD SEEN US HIS HEAD WAS OUT OF THE WINDOW AS WE CLIMBED ON TO THE FOOT BOARD HOWEVER NOTHING HAPPENED UNTIL WE STOPPED AT SOUTHAMPTON WEST
4872-20426-0092 FOR WE NATURALLY EXPECTED OUR FRIENDS TO MAKE A RUSH FOR THE EXIT BUT THEY DIDN'T
4872-20426-0093 THAT THEY DIDN'T SLIP AWAY ACROSS THE LINE FROM THE OFF SIDE BUT STILL THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THEM THEN I WALKED UP THE TRAIN TO THE COMPARTMENT WHICH I HAD SEEN THEM ENTER AND THERE THEY WERE APPARENTLY FAST ASLEEP IN THE CORNER BY THE OFF SIDE WINDOW
4872-20426-0094 THE MAN LEANING BACK WITH HIS MOUTH OPEN AND THE WOMAN RESTING AGAINST HIM WITH HER HEAD ON HIS SHOULDER SHE GAVE ME QUITE A TURN WHEN I WENT IN TO LOOK AT THEM FOR SHE HAD HER EYES HALF CLOSED AND SEEMED TO BE LOOKING ROUND AT ME WITH A MOST HORRIBLE EXPRESSION
4872-20426-0095 THEY WERE DEAD I SUPPOSE SAID THORNDYKE YES SIR STONE DEAD
4872-20426-0096 HE HELD UP TWO TINY YELLOW GLASS TUBES EACH LABELLED HYPODERMIC TABLOIDS
4872-20426-0097 HA EXCLAIMED THORNDYKE THIS FELLOW WAS WELL UP IN ALKALOIDAL POISONS IT SEEMS
4872-20426-0098 THESE TUBES EACH CONTAINED TWENTY TABLOIDS A THIRTY SECOND OF A GRAIN ALTOGETHER SO WE MAY ASSUME THAT ABOUT TWELVE TIMES THE MEDICINAL DOSE WAS SWALLOWED DEATH MUST HAVE OCCURRED IN A FEW MINUTES AND A MERCIFUL DEATH TOO
4872-20426-0099 A MORE MERCIFUL DEATH THAN THEY DESERVED EXCLAIMED STEPHEN WHEN ONE THINKS OF THE MISERY AND SUFFERING THAT THEY INFLICTED ON POOR OLD UNCLE JEFFREY I WOULD SOONER HAVE HAD THEM HANGED IT'S BETTER AS IT IS SIR
4872-20426-0100 TO RAISE ANY QUESTIONS IN DETAIL AT THE INQUEST THE PUBLICITY OF A TRIAL FOR MURDER WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY UNPLEASANT FOR YOU
4872-20426-0101 BUT THERE I MUSTN'T RUN DOWN MY BROTHER OFFICERS AND IT'S EASY TO BE WISE AFTER THE EVENT
