3744-177438-0000 RUPE COLLINS FOR SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THIS PENROD THOUGHT OF GROWING UP TO BE A MONK
3744-177438-0001 AND A PAIR OF MARGARET'S OUTWORN DANCING SLIPPERS TO A POOR UNGRATEFUL OLD MAN SOJOURNING IN A SHED UP THE ALLEY AND ALTHOUGH MISTER ROBERT WILLIAMS AFTER A VERY SHORT INTERVAL BEGAN TO LEAVE HIS GUITAR ON THE FRONT PORCH AGAIN EXACTLY AS IF HE THOUGHT NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
3744-177438-0002 PENROD WITH HIS YOUNGER VISION OF A FATHER'S MOOD REMAINED COLDLY DISTANT FROM THE JONES NEIGHBOURHOOD WITH HIS OWN FAMILY HIS MANNER WAS GENTLE PROUD AND SAD BUT NOT FOR LONG ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN THEM THE CHANGE CAME WITH MYSTIFYING ABRUPTNESS AT THE END OF THE WEEK
3744-177438-0003 IT WAS DUKE WHO BROUGHT IT ABOUT DUKE COULD CHASE A MUCH BIGGER DOG OUT OF THE SCHOFIELDS YARD AND FAR DOWN THE STREET THIS MIGHT BE THOUGHT TO INDICATE UNUSUAL VALOUR ON THE PART OF DUKE AND COWARDICE ON THAT OF THE BIGGER DOGS WHOM HE UNDOUBTEDLY PUT TO ROUT ON THE CONTRARY
3744-177438-0004 ALL SUCH FLIGHTS WERE FOUNDED IN MERE SUPERSTITION FOR DOGS ARE EVEN MORE SUPERSTITIOUS THAN BOYS AND COLOURED PEOPLE AND THE MOST FIRMLY ESTABLISHED OF ALL DOG SUPERSTITIONS IS THAT ANY DOG BE HE THE SMALLEST AND FEEBLEST IN THE WORLD CAN WHIP ANY TRESPASSER WHATSOEVER
3744-177438-0005 A RAT TERRIER BELIEVES THAT ON HIS HOME GROUNDS HE CAN WHIP AN ELEPHANT IT FOLLOWS OF COURSE THAT A BIG DOG AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOME WILL RUN FROM A LITTLE DOG IN THE LITTLE DOG'S NEIGHBOURHOOD OTHERWISE THE BIG DOG MUST FACE A CHARGE OF INCONSISTENCY
3744-177438-0006 AND DOGS ARE AS CONSISTENT AS THEY ARE SUPERSTITIOUS A DOG BELIEVES IN WAR BUT HE IS CONVINCED THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IT IS MORAL TO RUN AND THE THOUGHTFUL PHYSIOGNOMIST SEEING A BIG DOG FLEEING OUT OF A LITTLE DOG'S YARD
3744-177438-0007 MUST OBSERVE THAT THE EXPRESSION OF THE BIG DOG'S FACE IS MORE CONSCIENTIOUS THAN ALARMED IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF A PERSON PERFORMING A DUTY TO HIMSELF PENROD UNDERSTOOD THESE MATTERS PERFECTLY
3744-177438-0008 HE KNEW THAT THE GAUNT BROWN HOUND DUKE CHASED UP THE ALLEY HAD FLED ONLY OUT OF DEFERENCE TO A CUSTOM YET PENROD COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM BRAGGING OF DUKE TO THE HOUND'S OWNER A FAT FACED STRANGER OF TWELVE OR THIRTEEN WHO HAD WANDERED INTO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
3744-177438-0009 YOU BETTER CATCH HIM AND HOLD HIM TILL I GET MINE INSIDE THE YARD AGAIN DUKE'S CHEWED UP SOME PRETTY BAD BULLDOGS AROUND HERE THE FAT FACED BOY GAVE PENROD A FISHY STARE
3744-177438-0010 IT'LL MAKE HIM SICK WHAT WILL THE STRANGER LAUGHED RASPINGLY AND GAZED UP THE ALLEY WHERE THE HOUND HAVING COME TO A HALT NOW COOLLY SAT DOWN AND WITH AN EXPRESSION OF ROGUISH BENEVOLENCE PATRONIZINGLY WATCHED THE TEMPERED FURY OF DUKE
3744-177438-0011 WHOSE ASSAULTS AND BARKINGS WERE BECOMING PERFUNCTORY WHAT'LL MAKE DUKE SICK PENROD DEMANDED EATIN DEAD BULLDOGS PEOPLE LEAVE AROUND HERE THIS WAS NOT IMPROVISATION BUT FORMULA
3744-177438-0012 ADAPTED FROM OTHER OCCASIONS TO THE PRESENT ENCOUNTER NEVERTHELESS IT WAS NEW TO PENROD AND HE WAS SO TAKEN WITH IT THAT RESENTMENT LOST ITSELF IN ADMIRATION HASTILY COMMITTING THE GEM TO MEMORY FOR USE UPON A DOG OWNING FRIEND
3744-177438-0013 HE INQUIRED IN A SOCIABLE TONE WHAT'S YOUR DOG'S NAME DAN YOU BETTER CALL YOUR OLE PUP CAUSE DAN EATS LIVE DOGS DAN'S ACTIONS POORLY SUPPORTED HIS MASTER'S ASSERTION FOR UPON DUKE'S CEASING TO BARK
3744-177438-0014 DAN ROSE AND SHOWED THE MOST COURTEOUS INTEREST IN MAKING THE LITTLE OLD DOG'S ACQUAINTANCE DAN HAD A GREAT DEAL OF MANNER AND IT BECAME PLAIN THAT DUKE WAS IMPRESSED FAVOURABLY IN SPITE OF FORMER PREJUDICE SO THAT PRESENTLY THE TWO TROTTED AMICABLY BACK TO THEIR MASTERS
3744-177438-0015 AND SAT DOWN WITH THE HARMONIOUS BUT INDIFFERENT AIR OF HAVING KNOWN EACH OTHER INTIMATELY FOR YEARS THEY WERE RECEIVED WITHOUT COMMENT
