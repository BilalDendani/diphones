4703-59231-0000 SOME WORDS UTTERED BY HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN OF THE BELGIANS
4703-59231-0001 THE PRUSSIAN MONARCHY WILL ONE DAY BE THE SOURCE OF INFINITE CALAMITY NOT ONLY TO GERMANY BUT LIKEWISE TO THE WHOLE OF EUROPE THE EMPRESS MARIA THERESA
4703-59231-0002 FAR AWAY FAR AWAY AND OUT OF THE WORLD SEEMS THIS PLACE WHERE THE PERSECUTED QUEEN HAS TAKEN REFUGE I DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG MY MOTOR CAR ITS WINDOWS LASHED BY RAIN HAS ROLLED ALONG IN THE DIM LIGHT CAUSED BY SHOWERS AND APPROACHING NIGHT
4703-59231-0003 WHEN AT LAST THE BELGIAN NON COMMISSIONED OFFICER WHO GUIDED MY CHAUFFEUR ALONG THESE UNFAMILIAR ROADS ANNOUNCES THAT WE HAVE ARRIVED HER MAJESTY QUEEN ELIZABETH OF THE BELGIANS HAS DEIGNED TO GRANT ME AN AUDIENCE AT HALF PAST SIX
4703-59231-0004 AND I TREMBLED LEST I SHOULD BE LATE FOR THE WAY SEEMED INTERMINABLE THROUGH A COUNTRYSIDE WHICH IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE BUT WE WERE IN TIME PUNCTUAL TO A MOMENT
4703-59231-0005 AT HALF PAST SIX ON AN EVENING IN MARCH UNDER AN OVERCAST SKY IT IS ALREADY DARK AS NIGHT THE CAR STOPS AND I JUMP OUT ON TO THE SANDS OF THE SEASHORE I RECOGNISE THE SOUND OF THE OCEAN CLOSE AT HAND
4703-59231-0006 AND THE BOUNDLESS EXPANSE OF THE NORTH SEA LESS DARK THAN THE SKY IS VAGUELY PERCEPTIBLE TO THE SIGHT RAIN AND COLD WINDS RAGE AROUND US ON THE DUNES TWO OR THREE HOUSES WITHOUT LIGHTS IN THE WINDOWS ARE VISIBLE AS GREYISH OUTLINES
4703-59231-0007 HOWEVER SOMEONE CARRYING A LITTLE SHINING GLASS LAMP IS HURRYING TO RECEIVE ME HE IS AN OFFICER IN HER MAJESTY'S SERVICE CARRYING ONE OF THOSE ELECTRIC TORCHES WHICH THE WIND DOES NOT BLOW OUT AND WHICH IN FRANCE WE CALL AN APACHE'S LANTERN
4703-59231-0008 ON ENTERING THE FIRST HOUSE TO WHICH THE AIDE DE CAMP CONDUCTS ME
4703-59231-0009 THIS FIRST VILLA SHELTERS ONLY LADIES IN WAITING AND OFFICERS OF THAT COURT NOW SO SHORN OF CEREMONY AND EVERY EVENING IT IS PLUNGED PURPOSELY IN DARKNESS AS A PRECAUTION AGAINST SHRAPNEL FIRE A MOMENT LATER
4703-59231-0010 I AM SUMMONED TO HER MAJESTY'S PRESENCE ESCORTED BY THE SAME PLEASANT OFFICER WITH HIS LANTERN I HURRY ACROSS TO THE NEXT HOUSE THE RAIN IS MINGLED WITH WHITE BUTTERFLIES WHICH ARE FLAKES OF SNOW
4703-59231-0011 VERY INDISTINCTLY I SEE A DESERT LIKE LANDSCAPE OF DUNES AND SANDS ALMOST WHITE STRETCHING OUT INTO INFINITY WOULD YOU NOT IMAGINE IT A SITE IN THE SAHARA SAYS MY GUIDE
4703-59231-0012 WHEN YOUR ARAB CAVALRY CAME HERE THE ILLUSION WAS COMPLETE IT IS TRUE FOR EVEN IN AFRICA THE SANDS TURN PALE IN THE DARKNESS BUT THIS IS A SAHARA TRANSPORTED UNDER THE GLOOMY SKY OF A NORTHERN NIGHT
4703-59231-0013 AND IT HAS ASSUMED THERE TOO DEEP A MELANCHOLY IN THE VILLA WE ENTER A WARM WELL LIGHTED ROOM WHICH WITH ITS RED FURNISHINGS
4703-59231-0014 BATTERED BY WINTRY SQUALLS AND THERE IS A PLEASURE WHICH AT FIRST TRANSCENDS EVERYTHING ELSE THE PHYSICAL PLEASURE OF APPROACHING A FIREPLACE WITH A GOOD BLAZING FIRE
4703-59231-0015 WHILE WAITING FOR THE QUEEN I NOTICE A LONG PACKING CASE LYING ON TWO CHAIRS IT IS MADE OF THAT FINE UNEQUALLED WHITE CARPENTRY WHICH IMMEDIATELY REMINDS ME OF NAGASAKI AND ON IT ARE PAINTED JAPANESE LETTERS IN COLUMNS
4703-59231-0016 THE OFFICER'S GLANCE FOLLOWED MINE THAT HE SAYS IS A MAGNIFICENT ANCIENT SABRE WHICH THE JAPANESE HAVE JUST SENT TO OUR KING I PERSONALLY HAD FORGOTTEN THEM THOSE DISTANT ALLIES OF OURS IN THE FARTHEST EAST
4703-59231-0017 YET IT IS TRUE THAT THEY ARE ON OUR SIDE HOW STRANGE A THING AND EVEN OVER THERE THE WOES OF THESE TWO GRACIOUS SOVEREIGNS ARE UNIVERSALLY KNOWN AND THE JAPANESE DESIRED TO SHOW THEIR SPECIAL SYMPATHY BY SENDING THEM A VALUABLE PRESENT
4703-59231-0018 BUT A LADY IN WAITING APPEARS ANNOUNCING HER MAJESTY AND HE WITHDRAWS AT ONCE HER MAJESTY IS COMING SAYS THE LADY IN WAITING THE QUEEN WHOM I HAVE NEVER YET SEEN CONSECRATED AS IT WERE BY SUFFERING
4703-59231-0019 WITH WHAT INFINITE REVERENCE I AWAIT HER COMING STANDING THERE IN FRONT OF THE FIRE WHILE WIND AND SNOW CONTINUE TO RAGE IN THE BLACK NIGHT OUTSIDE THROUGH WHICH DOOR WILL SHE ENTER DOUBTLESS BY THAT DOOR OVER THERE AT THE END OF THE ROOM
4703-59231-0020 ON WHICH MY ATTENTION IS INVOLUNTARILY CONCENTRATED BUT NO A SOFT RUSTLING SOUND MAKES ME TURN MY HEAD TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROOM AND FROM BEHIND A SCREEN OF RED SILK WHICH CONCEALED ANOTHER DOOR
4703-59231-0021 THE YOUNG QUEEN APPEARS SO NEAR TO ME THAT I HAVE NOT ROOM TO MAKE MY COURT BOW MY FIRST IMPRESSION NECESSARILY FURTIVE AS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING A MERE VISUAL IMPRESSION I MIGHT SAY A COLOURIST'S IMPRESSION
4703-59231-0022 IS A DAZZLING LITTLE VISION OF BLUE THE BLUE OF HER GOWN BUT MORE ESPECIALLY THE BLUE OF HER EYES WHICH SHINE LIKE TWO LUMINOUS STARS AND THEN SHE HAS SUCH AN AIR OF YOUTH SHE SEEMS THIS EVENING TWENTY FOUR
4703-59231-0023 AND SCARCELY THAT FROM THE DIFFERENT PORTRAITS I HAD SEEN OF HER MAJESTY PORTRAITS SO LITTLE FAITHFUL TO LIFE I HAD GATHERED THAT SHE WAS VERY TALL WITH A PROFILE ALMOST TOO LONG BUT ON THE CONTRARY SHE IS OF MEDIUM HEIGHT
4703-59231-0024 AND HER FACE IS SMALL WITH EXQUISITELY REFINED FEATURES A FACE ALMOST ETHEREAL SO DELICATE THAT IT ALMOST VANISHES ECLIPSED BY THOSE MARVELLOUS LIMPID EYES LIKE TWO PURE TURQUOISES
4703-59231-0025 TRANSPARENT TO REVEAL THE LIGHT WITHIN EVEN A MAN UNAWARE OF HER RANK AND OF EVERYTHING CONCERNING HER HER DEVOTION TO DUTY THE SUPERLATIVE DIGNITY OF HER ACTIONS HER SERENE RESIGNATION
4703-59231-0026 HER ADMIRABLE SIMPLE CHARITY WOULD SAY TO HIMSELF AT FIRST SIGHT THE WOMAN WITH THOSE EYES WHO MAY SHE BE ASSUREDLY ONE WHO SOARS VERY HIGH AND WILL NEVER FALTER WHO WITHOUT EVEN A TREMOR OF HER EYELIDS
4703-59231-0027 CAN LOOK IN THE FACE NOT ONLY TEMPTATIONS BUT LIKEWISE DANGER AND DEATH WITH WHAT REVERENT SYMPATHY FREE FROM VULGAR CURIOSITY
4703-59231-0028 WHEN SHE CONTEMPLATES THE DRAMA OF HER DESTINY BUT A CONVERSATION WITH A QUEEN IS NOT DIRECTED BY ONE'S OWN FANCY AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE AUDIENCE HER MAJESTY TOUCHES UPON DIFFERENT SUBJECTS LIGHTLY AND GRACEFULLY
4703-59231-0029 AS IF THERE WERE NOTHING UNUSUAL HAPPENING IN THE WORLD WE TALK OF THE EAST WHERE WE HAVE BOTH TRAVELLED WE TALK OF BOOKS SHE HAS READ IT SEEMS AS IF WE WERE OBLIVIOUS OF THE GREAT TRAGEDY WHICH IS BEING ENACTED
4703-59231-0030 STREWN WITH RUINS AND THE DEAD SOON HOWEVER PERHAPS BECAUSE A LITTLE BOND OF CONFIDENCE HAS ESTABLISHED ITSELF BETWEEN US
4703-59231-0031 FURNES TOWNS FROM WHICH I HAVE JUST COME THEN THE TWO BLUE STARS GAZING AT ME SEEM TO ME TO GROW A LITTLE MISTY IN SPITE OF AN EFFORT TO KEEP THEM CLEAR BUT MADAM I SAY
4703-59231-0032 THERE STILL REMAINS STANDING ENOUGH OF THE WALLS TO ENABLE ALL THE OUTLINES TO BE TRACED AGAIN AND ALMOST EVERYTHING TO BE PRACTICALLY RECONSTRUCTED IN THE BETTER TIMES THAT ARE IN STORE AH SHE ANSWERS REBUILD
4703-59231-0033 CERTAINLY IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO REBUILD BUT IT WILL NEVER BE MORE THAN AN IMITATION AND FOR ME SOMETHING ESSENTIAL WILL ALWAYS BE LACKING I SHALL MISS THE SOUL WHICH HAS PASSED AWAY THEN I SEE
4703-59231-0034 HOW DEARLY HER MAJESTY HAD ALREADY LOVED THOSE MARVELS NOW RUINED AND ALL THE PAST OF HER ADOPTED COUNTRY WHICH SURVIVED THERE IN THE OLD STONE TRACERY OF FLANDERS
4703-59231-0035 AND GRADUALLY WE AT LAST COME TO TALK OF GERMANY ONE OF THE SENTIMENTS PREDOMINANT IT SEEMS IN HER BRUISED HEART IS THAT OF AMAZEMENT THE MOST PAINFUL AS WELL AS THE MOST COMPLETE AMAZEMENT AT SO MANY CRIMES
4703-59231-0036 THERE HAS BEEN SOME CHANGE IN THEM SHE SAYS IN HESITATING WORDS THEY USED NOT TO BE LIKE THIS THE CROWN PRINCE
4703-59231-0037 WHOM I KNEW VERY WELL IN MY CHILDHOOD WAS GENTLE
4703-59231-0038 THINK OF IT AS I MAY DAY AND NIGHT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND NO IN THE OLD DAYS THEY WERE NOT LIKE THIS OF THAT I AM SURE
4703-59231-0039 BUT I KNOW VERY WELL THAT THEY WERE EVER THUS AS INDEED ALL OF US KNOW THEY WERE ALWAYS THE SAME FROM THE BEGINNING UNDER THEIR INSCRUTABLE HYPOCRISY BUT HOW COULD I VENTURE TO CONTRADICT THIS QUEEN
4703-59231-0040 BORN AMONG THEM LIKE A BEAUTIFUL RARE FLOWER AMONG STINGING NETTLES AND BRAMBLES TO BE SURE THE UNLEASHING OF THEIR LATENT BARBARISM WHICH WE ARE NOW WITNESSING IS THE WORK OF THAT KING OF PRUSSIA
4703-59231-0041 WHO IS THE FAITHFUL SUCCESSOR OF HIM WHOM FORMERLY THE GREAT EMPRESS MARIA THERESA STIGMATISED IT IS HE INDEED WHO TO USE THE BITTER YET VERY JUST AMERICAN EXPRESSION HAS GIVEN THEM SWELLED HEADS
4703-59231-0042 BUT THEIR CHARACTER WAS EVER THE SAME IN ALL AGES AND IN ORDER TO FORM A JUDGMENT OF THEIR SOULS STEEPED IN LIES MURDERS AND RAPINE IT IS SUFFICIENT TO READ THEIR WRITERS THEIR THINKERS WHOSE CYNICISM LEAVES US AGHAST
4703-59231-0043 AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE IN WHICH NOTHING IS HEARD BUT THE NOISE OF THE WIND OUTSIDE REMEMBERING THAT THE YOUNG MARTYRED QUEEN WAS A BAVARIAN PRINCESS I VENTURE TO RECALL THE FACT THAT THE BAVARIANS IN THE GERMANY ARMY
4703-59231-0044 WERE TROUBLED AT THE PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY THE QUEEN OF THE BELGIANS WHO HAD SPRUNG FROM THEIR OWN RACE AND INDIGNANT WHEN THE MONSTER WHO LEADS THIS WITCHES SABBATH EVEN TRIED TO SINGLE OUT HER CHILDREN
4703-59231-0045 BUT THE QUEEN RAISING HER LITTLE HAND FROM WHERE IT RESTED ON THE SILKEN TEXTURE OF HER GOWN OUTLINES A GESTURE WHICH SIGNIFIES SOMETHING INEXORABLY FINAL AND IN A GRAVE LOW VOICE
4703-59231-0046 SHE UTTERS THIS PHRASE WHICH FALLS UPON THE SILENCE WITH THE SOLEMNITY OF A SENTENCE WHENCE THERE IS NO APPEAL IT IS AT AN END BETWEEN THEM AND ME HAS FALLEN A CURTAIN OF IRON WHICH WILL NEVER AGAIN BE LIFTED
4703-59231-0047 AT THE SAME TIME AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF HER CHILDHOOD DOUBTLESS AND OF THOSE WHOM SHE LOVED OVER THERE
