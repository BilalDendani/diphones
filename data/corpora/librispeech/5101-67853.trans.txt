5101-67853-0000 WHEN SYLVIA HAD TOLD ESTRALLA TO COME TO HER ROOM THAT NIGHT SHE HAD DETERMINED TO FIND A WAY TO GET THE LITTLE NEGRO TO A PLACE OF SAFETY SYLVIA DID NOT KNOW THAT A NEGRO WAS IN THOSE FAR OFF DAYS
5101-67853-0001 THE PROPERTY OF HIS MASTER AS MUCH AS A HORSE OR A DOG AND THAT WHEREVER THE NEGRO MIGHT GO
5101-67853-0002 HIS MASTER COULD CLAIM HIM AND PUNISH HIM FOR TRYING TO ESCAPE ANY PERSON AIDING A SLAVE TO ESCAPE COULD ALSO BE PUNISHED BY LAW ALL SYLVIA THOUGHT OF WAS TO HAVE ESTRALLA PROTECTED
5101-67853-0003 AND SHE WAS QUITE SURE THAT A UNITED STATES FORT COULD PROTECT ONE LITTLE NEGRO GIRL NEVERTHELESS SHE WAS TROUBLED AND WORRIED AS TO HOW SHE COULD CARRY OUT HER PLAN BUT SHE RESOLVED NOT TO TELL GRACE
5101-67853-0004 AS USUAL FLORA WAS WAITING AT MISS PATTEN'S GATE FOR HER FRIENDS SHE WAS WEARING A PRETTY TURBAN HAT AND PINNED IN FRONT WAS A FINE BLUE COCKADE TO WHICH FLORA POINTED AND SAID LOOK GIRLS
5101-67853-0005 THIS IS THE SECESSION COCKADE RALPH GAVE IT TO ME SHE EXPLAINED ALL LOYAL CAROLINIANS OUGHT TO WEAR IT RALPH SAYS
5101-67853-0006 OH IT MEANS THAT YOU BELIEVE SOUTH CAROLINA HAS A RIGHT TO KEEP ITS SLAVES AND SELL THEM OF COURSE
5101-67853-0007 AND IF THE UNITED STATES INTERFERES WHY CAROLINIANS WILL TEACH THEM A LESSON FLORA EXPLAINED GRANDLY REPEATING THE EXPLANATION HER FATHER HAD GIVEN HER THAT VERY MORNING
5101-67853-0008 MANY OF THE OTHER GIRLS WORE BLUE COCKADES AND A PALMETTO FLAG WAS HUNG BEHIND MISS ROSALIE'S DESK YOUNG LADIES SAID MISS ROSALIE
5101-67853-0009 I HAVE HUNG SOUTH CAROLINA'S FLAG WHERE YOU CAN ALL SEE IT YOU ALL KNOW THAT A FLAG IS AN EMBLEM OUR FLAG MEANS THE GLORY OF OUR PAST AND THE HOPE OF THE FUTURE
5101-67853-0010 I WILL ASK YOU ALL TO RISE AND SALUTE THIS FLAG THE LITTLE GIRLS ALL STOOD AND EACH RAISED HER RIGHT HAND ALL BUT SYLVIA FLUSHED AND UNHAPPY WITH DOWNCAST EYES SHE KEPT HER SEAT
5101-67853-0011 SHE KNEW THAT THE PALMETTO FLAG STOOD FOR SLAVERY SYLVIA DID NOT KNOW WHAT MISS ROSALIE WOULD SAY TO HER AND EVEN WORSE THAN HER TEACHER'S DISAPPROVAL SHE WAS SURE THAT HER SCHOOLMATES
5101-67853-0012 PERHAPS EVEN GRACE AND FLORA WOULD DISLIKE AND BLAME HER FOR NOT SALUTING THEIR FLAG BUT SHE WAS SOON TO REALIZE JUST HOW SERIOUS WAS HER FAILURE TO SALUTE THE PALMETTO FLAG
5101-67853-0013 MISS ROSALIE CAME DOWN THE AISLE AND LAID A NOTE ON SYLVIA'S DESK IT WAS VERY BRIEF YOU MAY GO HOME AT RECESS TAKE YOUR BOOKS AND GO QUIETLY WITHOUT A WORD TO ANY OF THE OTHER PUPILS
5101-67853-0014 YOU MAY TELL YOUR PARENTS THAT I DO NOT CARE TO HAVE YOU AS A PUPIL FOR ANOTHER DAY AS SYLVIA READ THESE WORDS THE TEARS SPRANG TO HER EYES IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO NOT TO SOB ALOUD
5101-67853-0015 SHE DARED NOT LOOK AT THE OTHER GIRLS SHE HELD A BOOK BEFORE HER FACE AND ONLY HOPED THAT SHE COULD KEEP BACK THE TEARS UNTIL RECESS TIME
5101-67853-0016 BUT NOT FOR A MOMENT DID SYLVIA WISH THAT SHE HAD SALUTED A FLAG WHICH STOOD FOR THE PROTECTION OF SLAVERY MISS ROSALIE HAD SAID THAT A FLAG WAS AN EMBLEM AND EVEN IN HER UNHAPPINESS
5101-67853-0017 SYLVIA KNEW THAT THE EMBLEM OF THE UNITED STATES STOOD FOR JUSTICE AND LIBERTY WHEN THE HOUR OF RECESS CAME SYLVIA HAD HER BOOKS NEATLY STRAPPED AND AS MISS ROSALIE HAD DIRECTED
5101-67853-0018 SHE LEFT THE ROOM QUIETLY WITHOUT ONE WORD TO ANY OF THE OTHER GIRLS SHE HAD NEARLY REACHED THE GATE WHEN SHE HEARD STEPS CLOSE BEHIND HER
5101-67853-0019 AND GRACE'S ARM WAS ABOUT HER IT'S A MEAN SHAME DECLARED THE WARM HEARTED LITTLE SOUTHERN GIRL
5101-67853-0020 GRACE GRACE CALLED MISS ROSALIE AND BEFORE SYLVIA COULD RESPOND HER LOYAL PLAYMATE HAD TURNED OBEDIENTLY BACK TO THE HOUSE SYLVIA STEPPED OUT ON THE STREET HER EYES A LITTLE BLURRED BY TEARS
5101-67853-0021 BUT GREATLY COMFORTED BY GRACE'S ASSURING WORDS OF FRIENDSHIP SHE DID NOT WANT TO GO HOME AND TELL HER MOTHER WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND SHOW HER MISS PATTEN'S NOTE
5101-67853-0022 SUDDENLY SHE DECIDED TO GO TO HER FATHER'S WAREHOUSE AND TELL HIM AND GO HOME WITH HIM AT NOON SHE WAS SURE HER FATHER WOULD THINK SHE HAD DONE RIGHT SHE TURNED AND WALKED QUICKLY DOWN KING STREET
5101-67853-0023 AND IN A SHORT TIME SHE WAS NEAR THE WHARVES AND COULD SEE THE LONG BUILDING WHERE HER FATHER STORED THE COTTON HE PURCHASED FROM THE PLANTERS THE WHARVES WERE PILED HIGH WITH BOXES AND BALES AND THERE WERE SMALL BOATS COMING IN TO THE WHARVES
5101-67853-0024 AND OTHERS MAKING READY TO DEPART SYLVIA COULD SEE HER FATHER'S BOAT CLOSE TO THE WHARF NEAR THE WAREHOUSE I WISH I COULD TAKE THAT BOAT AND CARRY ESTRALLA OFF TO FORT SUMTER SHE THOUGHT
5101-67853-0025 A GOOD NATURED NEGRO LED HER TO MISTER FULTON'S OFFICE AND BEFORE HER FATHER COULD SAY A WORD SYLVIA WAS IN THE MIDST OF HER STORY SHE TOLD OF THE BLUE COCKADES THAT THE OTHER GIRLS WORE
5101-67853-0026 OF THE PALMETTO FLAG AND OF HER FAILURE TO SALUTE IT AND HANDED HIM MISS PATTEN'S NOTE MISTER FULTON LOOKED SERIOUS AND TROUBLED AS HE LISTENED TO HIS LITTLE GIRL'S STORY THEN HE LIFTED HER TO HIS KNEE
5101-67853-0027 TOOK OFF HER PRETTY HAT AND SAID TOO BAD DEAR CHILD BUT YOU DID RIGHT A LITTLE YANKEE GIRL MUST BE LOYAL TO THE STARS AND STRIPES I AM GLAD YOU CAME AND TOLD ME FOR A MOMENT
5101-67853-0028 IT SEEMED TO SYLVIA THAT HER FATHER HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT HER HE WAS LOOKING STRAIGHT OUT OF THE WINDOW WHILE HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HIS LITTLE GIRL
5101-67853-0029 HE WAS THINKING THAT CHARLESTON PEOPLE MUST BE QUITE READY TO TAKE THE SERIOUS STEP OF URGING THEIR STATE TO DECLARE HER SECESSION FROM THE UNITED STATES AND HER RIGHT TO BUY AND SELL HUMAN BEINGS AS SLAVES HE WISHED THAT THE UNITED STATES OFFICERS AT FORT MOULTRIE
5101-67853-0030 COULD REALIZE THAT AT ANY TIME CHARLESTON MEN MIGHT SEIZE FORT SUMTER WHERE THERE WERE BUT FEW SOLDIERS AND HE SAID ALOUD I OUGHT TO WARN THEM SYLVIA WONDERED FOR A MOMENT WHAT HER FATHER COULD MEAN BUT HE SAID QUICKLY
5101-67853-0031 JUMP DOWN AND PUT ON YOUR HAT I'M GOING TO SAIL DOWN TO FORT MOULTRIE AND HAVE A TALK WITH MY GOOD FRIENDS THERE AND YOU CAN COME WITH ME AT THIS GOOD NEWS SYLVIA FORGOT ALL HER TROUBLES A SAIL ACROSS THE HARBOR WITH HER FATHER
5101-67853-0032 WAS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL THING THAT SHE COULD IMAGINE AND SHE HELD FAST TO HIS HAND SMILING HAPPILY AS THEY WALKED DOWN THE WHARF WHERE THE BOAT WAS FASTENED MISTER FULTON WAS BEGINNING TO FIND HIS POSITION AS A NORTHERN MAN IN CHARLESTON RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE
5101-67853-0033 MANY OF HIS SOUTHERN FRIENDS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT THE NORTHERN MEN HAD NO RIGHT TO TELL THEM THAT SLAVERY WAS WRONG AND MUST CEASE HE WISHED TO PROTECT HIS BUSINESS INTERESTS OR HE WOULD HAVE RETURNED TO BOSTON
5101-67853-0034 FOR IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM NOT TO DECLARE HIS OWN PATRIOTIC FEELING THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN WHO HAD JUST BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD NEVER PERMIT SLAVERY TO CONTINUE
5101-67853-0035 MISTER FULTON SENT A DARKY WITH A MESSAGE TO SYLVIA'S MOTHER THAT HE WAS TAKING THE LITTLE GIRL FOR A SAIL TO THE FORTS AND IN A SHORT TIME THEY WERE ON BOARD THE BUTTERFLY AS SYLVIA HAD NAMED THE WHITE SLOOP AND WERE GOING SWIFTLY DOWN THE HARBOR
5101-67853-0036 ASKED SYLVIA AND MISTER FULTON SMILINGLY AGREED HE WAS VERY PROUD OF HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER'S ABILITY TO SAIL A BOAT AND ALTHOUGH HE WATCHED HER SHAPE THE BOAT'S COURSE AND WAS READY TO GIVE HER ANY NEEDED ASSISTANCE
5101-67853-0037 HE WAS SURE THAT HE COULD TRUST HER AS THEY SAILED PAST FORT SUMTER SYLVIA COULD SEE MEN AT WORK REPAIRING THE FORTIFICATIONS OVER BOTH FORTS WAVED THE STARS AND STRIPES SHE MADE A SKILFUL LANDING AT FORT MOULTRIE
5101-67853-0038 GREATLY TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE SENTRY ON GUARD MISTER FULTON AND SYLVIA WENT DIRECTLY TO THE OFFICER'S QUARTERS WHICH WERE IN THE REAR OF THE FORT AND WHERE MISSUS CARLETON GAVE SYLVIA A WARM WELCOME SHE ASKED THE LITTLE GIRL ABOUT HER SCHOOL
5101-67853-0039 AND SYLVIA TOLD HER WHAT HAD HAPPENED THAT MORNING I AM NOT SURPRISED SAID CAPTAIN CARLETON
5101-67853-0040 IF MAJOR ANDERSON HAD HIS WAY WE WOULD HAVE A STRONGER FORCE IN FORT SUMTER AND THAT IS GREATLY NEEDED MAJOR ANDERSON WAS THE OFFICER IN COMMAND AT FORT MOULTRIE
5101-67853-0041 HE WAS A SOUTHERN MAN BUT A TRUE AND LOYAL OFFICER OF THE UNITED STATES WHEN CAPTAIN CARLETON AND MISTER FULTON WENT OUT MISSUS CARLETON ASKED SYLVIA IF SHE WAS SORRY TO LEAVE THE SCHOOL AND IF SHE LIKED HER SCHOOLMATES
5101-67853-0042 SYLVIA WAS EAGER TO TELL HER OF ALL THE GOOD TIMES SHE HAD ENJOYED WITH GRACE AND FLORA AND DECLARED THAT THEY WERE HER TRUE FRIENDS THEN SHE TOLD MISSUS CARLETON ABOUT ESTRALLA
5101-67853-0043 AND OF HER RESOLVE THAT THE LITTLE DARKY GIRL SHOULD NOT BE SEPARATED FROM AUNT CONNIE YOUR BEST PLAN THEN WILL BE TO GO AND SEE MISTER ROBERT WAITE AND ASK HIM HE IS A KIND HEARTED MAN
5101-67853-0044 AND PERHAPS HE WILL PROMISE YOU TO LET THE CHILD STAY WITH HER MOTHER I HOPE IT WILL NOT BE LONG NOW BEFORE ALL THE SLAVES WILL BE SET FREE SAID MISSUS CARLETON BEFORE SYLVIA COULD RESPOND CAPTAIN CARLETON CAME HURRYING INTO THE ROOM
5101-67853-0045 HE HAD A LETTER IN HIS HAND AND ASKED SYLVIA TO EXCUSE MISSUS CARLETON FOR A MOMENT AND THEY LEFT THE ROOM TOGETHER IN A FEW MOMENTS MISSUS CARLETON RETURNED ALONE AND SYLVIA HEARD CAPTAIN CARLETON SAY IT IS WORTH TRYING
5101-67853-0046 IT IS NOT REALLY FOR ME SHE ADDED QUICKLY IT IS FOR THE UNITED STATES SOMETHING TO HELP KEEP THE FLAG FLYING OVER THESE FORTS OH CAN I DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT SYLVIA ASKED EAGERLY YES MY DEAR
5101-67853-0047 NOW LISTEN CAREFULLY HERE IS A LETTER WHICH MAJOR ANDERSON WANTS DELIVERED TO A GENTLEMAN WHO WILL START FOR WASHINGTON TO MORROW IF ANYONE FROM THIS FORT SHOULD BE SEEN VISITING THAT GENTLEMAN HE WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE CHARLESTON AS HE PLANS
