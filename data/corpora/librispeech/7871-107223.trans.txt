7871-107223-0000 BITTER CRIES AND LONG DRAWN MOANS
7871-107223-0001 AND AT NIGHT WILD SHRIEKS AND THE BURST OF DIABOLICAL LAUGHTER WOULD RING FROM IT OVER THE VALE
7871-107223-0002 BUT ANOTHER POPULAR BELIEF RESPECTING THIS MOUNTAIN WAS THAT IN IT VENUS THE PAGAN GODDESS OF LOVE HELD HER COURT
7871-107223-0003 AND THERE WERE NOT A FEW WHO DECLARED THAT THEY HAD SEEN FAIR FORMS OF FEMALE BEAUTY BECKONING THEM FROM THE MOUTH OF THE CHASM AND THAT THEY HAD HEARD DULCET STRAINS OF MUSIC WELL UP FROM THE ABYSS ABOVE THE THUNDER OF THE FALLING
7871-107223-0004 UNSEEN TORRENT CHARMED BY THE MUSIC
7871-107223-0005 VARIOUS INDIVIDUALS HAD ENTERED THE CAVE AND NONE HAD RETURNED
7871-107223-0006 WHERE THE LANDGRAVE HERMANN WAS HOLDING A GATHERING OF MINSTRELS WHO WERE TO CONTEND IN SONG FOR A PRIZE
7871-107223-0007 WAS A FAMOUS MINNESINGER AND ALL HIS LAYS WERE OF LOVE AND OF WOMEN FOR HIS HEART WAS FULL OF PASSION AND THAT NOT OF THE PUREST AND NOBLEST DESCRIPTION IT WAS TOWARDS DUSK THAT HE PASSED THE CLIFF
7871-107223-0008 HE SAW A WHITE GLIMMERING FIGURE OF MATCHLESS BEAUTY STANDING BEFORE HIM AND BECKONING HIM TO HER HE KNEW HER AT ONCE BY HER ATTRIBUTES AND BY HER SUPERHUMAN PERFECTION TO BE NONE OTHER THAN VENUS
7871-107223-0009 AS SHE SPAKE TO HIM THE SWEETEST STRAINS OF MUSIC FLOATED IN THE AIR A SOFT ROSEATE LIGHT GLOWED AROUND HER AND NYMPHS OF EXQUISITE LOVELINESS
7871-107223-0010 AND THE MINSTREL'S HEART BEGAN TO FEEL A STRANGE VOID THE BEAUTY THE MAGNIFICENCE THE VARIETY OF THE SCENES IN THE PAGAN GODDESS'S HOME AND ALL ITS HEATHENISH PLEASURES PALLED UPON HIM
7871-107223-0011 ONE LOOK UP AT THE DARK NIGHT SKY SPANGLED WITH STARS ONE GLIMPSE OF SIMPLE MOUNTAIN FLOWERS ONE TINKLE OF SHEEP BELLS AT THE SAME TIME HIS CONSCIENCE BEGAN TO REPROACH HIM
7871-107223-0012 IN VAIN DID HE ENTREAT VENUS TO PERMIT HIM TO DEPART
7871-107223-0013 HE CALLED UPON THE VIRGIN MOTHER THAT A RIFT IN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE APPEARED TO HIM AND HE STOOD AGAIN ABOVE GROUND HOW SWEET WAS THE MORNING AIR BALMY WITH THE SCENT OF HAY AS IT ROLLED UP THE MOUNTAIN TO HIM AND FANNED
7871-107223-0014 HIS HAGGARD CHEEK HOW DELIGHTFUL TO HIM WAS THE CUSHION OF MOSS AND SCANTY GRASS AFTER THE DOWNY COUCHES OF THE PALACE OF REVELRY BELOW HE PLUCKED THE LITTLE HEATHER BELLS AND HELD THEM BEFORE HIM
7871-107223-0015 THE TEARS ROLLED FROM HIS EYES AND MOISTENED HIS THIN AND WASTED HANDS HE LOOKED UP AT THE SOFT BLUE SKY AND THE NEWLY RISEN SUN AND HIS HEART OVERFLOWED WHAT WERE THE GOLDEN JEWEL INCRUSTED
7871-107223-0016 LAMP LIT VAULTS BENEATH TO THAT PURE DOME OF GOD'S BUILDING THE CHIME OF A VILLAGE CHURCH STRUCK SWEETLY ON HIS EAR SATIATED WITH BACCHANALIAN SONGS AND HE HURRIED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN TO THE CHURCH WHICH CALLED HIM
7871-107223-0017 THERE HE MADE HIS CONFESSION BUT THE PRIEST HORROR STRUCK AT HIS RECITAL DARED NOT GIVE HIM ABSOLUTION BUT PASSED HIM ON TO ANOTHER AND SO HE WENT FROM ONE TO ANOTHER
7871-107223-0018 TILL AT LAST HE WAS REFERRED TO THE POPE HIMSELF TO THE POPE HE WENT
7871-107223-0019 AND PRAYED FOR ABSOLUTION URBAN WAS A HARD AND STERN MAN AND SHOCKED AT THE IMMENSITY OF THE SIN HE THRUST THE PENITENT INDIGNANTLY FROM HIM EXCLAIMING GUILT SUCH AS THINE CAN NEVER NEVER BE REMITTED

7871-107223-0030 A MAN IS ENTICED INTO THEIR ABODE WHERE HE UNITES WITH A WOMAN OF THE UNDERGROUND RACE
7871-107223-0031 NOW THERE IS SCARCELY A COLLECTION OF FOLK LORE WHICH DOES NOT CONTAIN A STORY FOUNDED ON THIS ROOT

7871-107223-0057 WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PRIMEVAL STORY RADICAL IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US NOW TO ASCERTAIN BUT THE LEGEND AS IT SHAPED ITSELF IN THE MIDDLE AGES IS CERTAINLY INDICATIVE OF THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE NEW AND THE OLD FAITH
