4352-893-0000 AND IT WAS RENDERED ALL THE MORE DIFFICULT BY THE GIRL'S ENTIRE INNOCENCE FOR NANCY WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO GO OFF ALONE WITH EDWARD
4352-893-0001 YOU SEE THE POSITION WAS EXTREMELY COMPLICATED IT WAS AS COMPLICATED AS IT WELL COULD BE ALONG DELICATE LINES THERE WAS THE COMPLICATION CAUSED BY THE FACT THAT EDWARD AND LEONORA NEVER SPOKE TO EACH OTHER EXCEPT WHEN OTHER PEOPLE WERE PRESENT THEN AS I HAVE SAID
4352-893-0002 THEIR DEMEANOURS WERE QUITE PERFECT THERE WAS THE COMPLICATION CAUSED BY THE GIRL'S ENTIRE INNOCENCE THERE WAS THE FURTHER COMPLICATION THAT BOTH EDWARD AND LEONORA REALLY REGARDED THE GIRL AS THEIR DAUGHTER
4352-893-0003 SHE WAS TALL AND STRIKINGLY THIN SHE HAD A TORTURED MOUTH AGONIZED EYES AND A QUITE EXTRAORDINARY SENSE OF FUN
4352-893-0004 WHY SHE HAD THE HEAVIEST HEAD OF BLACK HAIR THAT I HAVE EVER COME ACROSS I USED TO WONDER HOW SHE COULD BEAR THE WEIGHT OF IT SHE WAS JUST OVER TWENTY ONE AND AT TIMES SHE SEEMED AS OLD AS THE HILLS AT TIMES NOT MUCH MORE THAN SIXTEEN
4352-893-0005 AND SHE COULD SIT FOR HOURS PERFECTLY STILL STEEPING HANDKERCHIEF AFTER HANDKERCHIEF IN VINEGAR WHEN LEONORA HAD ONE OF HER HEADACHES SHE WAS IN SHORT A MIRACLE OF PATIENCE WHO COULD BE ALMOST MIRACULOUSLY IMPATIENT
4352-893-0006 IT WAS NO DOUBT THE CONVENT TRAINING THAT EFFECTED THAT I REMEMBER THAT ONE OF HER LETTERS TO ME WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN RAN SOMETHING LIKE ON CORPUS CHRISTI OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN SOME OTHER SAINT'S DAY
4352-893-0007 I CANNOT KEEP THESE THINGS IN MY HEAD OUR SCHOOL PLAYED ROEHAMPTON AT HOCKEY AND SEEING THAT OUR SIDE WAS LOSING BEING THREE GOALS TO ONE AGAINST US AT HALFTIME
4352-893-0008 AND I REMEMBER THAT SHE SEEMED TO DESCRIBE AFTERWARDS A SORT OF SATURNALIA APPARENTLY WHEN THE VICTORIOUS FIFTEEN OR ELEVEN CAME INTO THE REFECTORY FOR SUPPER THE WHOLE SCHOOL JUMPED UPON THE TABLES AND CHEERED
4352-893-0009 THAT IS OF COURSE THE CATHOLIC TRADITION SATURNALIA
4352-893-0010 OR AT ANY RATE NANCY HAD A SENSE OF RECTITUDE
4352-893-0011 ONCE OR TWICE WHEN SHE HAD BEEN QUITE SMALL
4352-893-0012 IT WAS NEARLY ALWAYS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A SERVANT TO STAY IN THE FAMILY AND FOR DAYS AT A TIME APPARENTLY MISSUS RUFFORD WOULD BE INCAPABLE I FANCY SHE DRANK AT ANY RATE SHE HAD SO CUTTING A TONGUE THAT EVEN NANCY WAS AFRAID OF HER
4352-893-0013 NANCY MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY EMOTIONAL CHILD THEN ONE DAY QUITE SUDDENLY ON HER RETURN FROM A RIDE AT FORT WILLIAM NANCY HAD BEEN SENT WITH HER GOVERNESS
4352-893-0014 RIGHT DOWN SOUTH TO THAT CONVENT SCHOOL SHE HAD BEEN EXPECTING TO GO THERE IN TWO MONTHS TIME HER MOTHER DISAPPEARED FROM HER LIFE AT THAT TIME A FORTNIGHT LATER LEONORA CAME TO THE CONVENT AND TOLD HER THAT HER MOTHER WAS DEAD PERHAPS SHE WAS
4352-893-0015 AT ANY RATE I NEVER HEARD UNTIL THE VERY END WHAT BECAME OF MISSUS RUFFORD LEONORA NEVER SPOKE OF HER AND THEN MAJOR RUFFORD WENT TO INDIA FROM WHICH HE RETURNED VERY SELDOM AND ONLY FOR VERY SHORT VISITS
4352-893-0016 AND NANCY LIVED HERSELF GRADUALLY INTO THE LIFE AT BRANSHAW TELERAGH I THINK THAT FROM THAT TIME ONWARDS SHE LED A VERY HAPPY LIFE TILL THE END
4352-893-0017 I HAD KNOWN HER ALL THE TIME I MEAN THAT SHE ALWAYS CAME TO THE ASHBURNHAMS AT NAUHEIM FOR THE LAST FORTNIGHT OF THEIR STAY AND I WATCHED HER GRADUALLY GROWING
4352-893-0018 SHE ALWAYS EVEN KISSED ME NIGHT AND MORNING UNTIL SHE WAS ABOUT EIGHTEEN AND SHE WOULD SKIP ABOUT AND FETCH ME THINGS AND LAUGH AT MY TALES OF LIFE IN PHILADELPHIA
4352-893-0019 DURING ONE OF HER FATHER'S RARE VISITS TO EUROPE WE WERE SITTING IN THE GARDENS NEAR THE IRON STAINED FOUNTAIN LEONORA HAD ONE OF HER HEADACHES AND WE WERE WAITING FOR FLORENCE AND EDWARD TO COME FROM THEIR BATHS
4352-893-0020 OF THE MORAL SIDE OF IT I MEAN SHE WAS ALL IN WHITE AND SO TALL AND FRAGILE AND SHE HAD ONLY JUST PUT HER HAIR UP
4352-893-0021 AND OF UNFAMILIARITY OVER HER THROAT THERE PLAYED THE REFLECTION FROM A LITTLE POOL OF WATER
4352-893-0022 OF PIERCED CHIP STRAW HER THROAT WAS VERY LONG AND LEANED FORWARD AND HER EYEBROWS ARCHING A LITTLE AS SHE LAUGHED AT SOME OLD FASHIONEDNESS IN MY PHRASEOLOGY HAD ABANDONED THEIR TENSE LINE
4352-893-0023 AND TO THINK THAT THAT VIVID WHITE THING THAT SAINTLY AND SWANLIKE BEING TO THINK THAT WHY SHE WAS LIKE THE SAIL OF A SHIP SO WHITE AND SO DEFINITE IN HER MOVEMENTS
4352-893-0024 AND TO THINK THAT SHE WILL NEVER WHY SHE WILL NEVER DO ANYTHING AGAIN I CAN'T BELIEVE IT ANYHOW WE WERE CHATTERING AWAY ABOUT THE MORALITY OF LOTTERIES AND THEN SUDDENLY
4352-893-0025 IT WAS AS IF A MODIFIED FOGHORN HAD BOOMED WITH A REED INSIDE IT I LOOKED ROUND TO CATCH SIGHT OF HIM A TALL FAIR STIFFLY UPRIGHT MAN OF FIFTY HE WAS WALKING AWAY WITH AN ITALIAN BARON WHO HAD HAD MUCH TO DO WITH THE BELGIAN CONGO
4352-893-0026 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE PROPER TREATMENT OF NATIVES FOR I HEARD HIM SAY OH HANG HUMANITY WHEN I LOOKED AGAIN AT NANCY
4352-893-0027 IT WAS DREADFUL TO SEE HER WITH HER EYES CLOSED LIKE THAT OH SHE EXCLAIMED AND HER HAND THAT HAD APPEARED TO BE GROPING SETTLED FOR A MOMENT ON MY ARM NEVER SPEAK OF IT
4352-893-0028 THE BLESSED SAINTS SHE SAID YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD SPARE YOU SUCH THINGS I DON'T BELIEVE ALL THE SINNING IN THE WORLD COULD MAKE ONE DESERVE THEM
4352-893-0029 AND YET NO YOUNG GIRL COULD MORE ARCHLY AND LOVINGLY HAVE PLAYED WITH AN ADORED FATHER SHE WAS ALWAYS HOLDING HIM BY BOTH COAT LAPELS CROSS QUESTIONING HIM AS TO HOW HE SPENT HIS TIME KISSING THE TOP OF HIS HEAD
4352-893-0030 AH SHE WAS WELL BRED IF EVER ANYONE WAS THE POOR WRETCHED MAN CRINGED BEFORE HER
4352-893-0031 IT WAS ONLY THAT PECULIAR NOTE OF HIS VOICE USED WHEN HE WAS OVERBEARING OR DOGMATIC THAT COULD UNMAN HER AND THAT WAS ONLY VISIBLE WHEN IT CAME UNEXPECTEDLY
4352-893-0032 BY THE BOOMING SOUND OF HER FATHER'S VOICE IT WAS THAT SOUND THAT HAD ALWAYS PRECEDED HIS ENTRANCE
4352-893-0033 DURING THAT REMAINDER OF THEIR STAY AT NAUHEIM AFTER I HAD LEFT IT HAD SEEMED TO HER THAT SHE WAS FIGHTING A LONG DUEL WITH UNSEEN WEAPONS AGAINST SILENT ADVERSARIES NANCY AS I HAVE ALSO SAID
4352-893-0034 AND LEONORA FOUND IT TO BE HER DUTY TO STOP THAT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT NANCY WAS USED TO HAVING HER OWN WAY AND FOR YEARS SHE HAD BEEN USED TO GOING OFF WITH EDWARD RATTING RABBITING CATCHING SALMON DOWN AT FORDINGBRIDGE
4352-893-0035 LEONORA HAD CULTIVATED THE HABIT OF GOING TO BED AT TEN O'CLOCK
4352-893-0036 BUT FOR ALL THE TIME THEY WERE AT NAUHEIM SHE CONTRIVED NEVER TO LET THOSE TWO BE ALONE TOGETHER EXCEPT IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN VERY CROWDED PLACES IF A PROTESTANT HAD DONE THAT IT WOULD NO DOUBT HAVE AWAKENED A SELF CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE GIRL BUT
4352-893-0037 CAN MANAGE THESE THINGS BETTER AND I DARE SAY THAT TWO THINGS MADE THIS EASIER
4352-893-0038 HE APPEARED INDEED TO BE VERY ILL HIS SHOULDERS BEGAN TO BE BOWED
4352-893-0039 HE HAD EXTRAORDINARY MOMENTS OF INATTENTION AND LEONORA DESCRIBES HERSELF AS WATCHING HIM AS A FIERCE CAT
4352-893-0040 IN THAT SILENT WATCHING AGAIN I THINK SHE WAS A CATHOLIC
4352-893-0041 AT FIRST SHE THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE REMORSE OR GRIEF FOR THE DEATH OF FLORENCE THAT WAS OPPRESSING HIM
4352-893-0042 HE HAD NOT ANY IDEA THAT FLORENCE COULD HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE WITHOUT WRITING AT LEAST A TIRADE TO HIM
4352-893-0043 SHE THOUGHT IT MADE HER SEEM MORE ROMANTIC NO EDWARD HAD NO REMORSE HE WAS ABLE TO SAY TO HIMSELF THAT HE HAD TREATED FLORENCE WITH GALLANT ATTENTIVENESS OF THE KIND THAT SHE DESIRED UNTIL TWO HOURS BEFORE HER DEATH
4352-893-0044 LEONORA GATHERED THAT FROM THE LOOK IN HIS EYES AND FROM THE WAY HE STRAIGHTENED HIS SHOULDERS OVER HER AS SHE LAY IN HER COFFIN
4352-893-0045 HE DRANK A GOOD DEAL AT THAT TIME A STEADY
4352-893-0046 FOR LEONORA MADE THE GIRL GO TO BED AT TEN UNREASONABLE THOUGH THAT SEEMED TO NANCY SHE WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT WHILST THEY WERE IN A SORT OF HALF MOURNING FOR FLORENCE SHE OUGHT NOT TO BE SEEN AT PUBLIC PLACES LIKE THE CASINO
4352-893-0047 THAT SHE MADE THE GIRL AND HERSELF PERFORM FOR THE SOUL OF FLORENCE AND THEN ONE EVENING ABOUT A FORTNIGHT LATER WHEN THE GIRL GROWING RESTIVE AT EVEN DEVOTIONAL EXERCISES CLAMOURED ONCE MORE TO BE ALLOWED TO GO FOR A WALK WITH EDWARD AND WHEN LEONORA WAS REALLY AT HER WITS END
4352-893-0048 EDWARD GAVE HIMSELF INTO HER HANDS HE WAS JUST STANDING UP FROM DINNER AND HAD HIS FACE AVERTED BUT HE TURNED HIS HEAVY HEAD AND HIS BLOODSHOT EYES UPON HIS WIFE AND LOOKED FULL AT HER DOCTOR VON HAUPTMANN HE SAID HAS ORDERED ME TO GO TO BED IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER
4352-893-0049 UNTIL THE GIRL WAS WELL IN BED READING IN THE ANGLICAN PRAYER BOOK
4352-893-0050 TWO AND A HALF HOURS LATER THEY CAME BACK STUMBLING HEAVILY SHE REMAINED REFLECTING UPON THIS POSITION UNTIL THE LAST NIGHT OF THEIR STAY AT NAUHEIM THEN SHE SUDDENLY ACTED FOR
4352-893-0051 HE LOOKED AT HER IN TURN FOR A LONG BALANCING MINUTE WHY YES HE SAID AT LAST NANCY JUMPED OUT OF HER CHAIR AND KISSED HIM THOSE TWO WORDS LEONORA SAID GAVE HER THE GREATEST RELIEF OF ANY TWO SYLLABLES SHE HAD EVER HEARD IN HER LIFE
4352-893-0052 FOR SHE REALIZED THAT EDWARD WAS BREAKING UP
4352-893-0053 SHE COULD RELAX SOME OF HER VIGILANCE NEVERTHELESS SHE SAT IN THE DARKNESS BEHIND HER HALF CLOSED JALOUSIES LOOKING OVER THE STREET AND THE NIGHT AND THE TREES UNTIL VERY LATE SHE COULD HEAR NANCY'S CLEAR VOICE COMING CLOSER AND SAYING
4352-893-0054 AND EDWARD REPLIED WITH HIS SORT OF SULKY GOOD NATURE AS FOR YOU
4352-893-0055 THE GIRL CAME SWINGING ALONG
