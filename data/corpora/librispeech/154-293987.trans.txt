154-293987-0000 THOU MUST KNOW THAT A CERTAIN WIDOW FAIR YOUNG INDEPENDENT AND RICH AND ABOVE ALL FREE AND EASY FELL IN LOVE WITH A STURDY STRAPPING YOUNG LAY BROTHER HIS SUPERIOR CAME TO KNOW OF IT
154-293987-0001 AND ONE DAY SAID TO THE WORTHY WIDOW BY WAY OF BROTHERLY REMONSTRANCE I AM SURPRISED SENORA AND NOT WITHOUT GOOD REASON THAT A WOMAN OF SUCH HIGH STANDING SO FAIR AND SO RICH AS YOU ARE
154-293987-0002 SHOULD HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH SUCH A MEAN LOW STUPID FELLOW AS SO AND SO WHEN IN THIS HOUSE THERE ARE SO MANY MASTERS GRADUATES AND DIVINITY STUDENTS FROM AMONG WHOM YOU MIGHT CHOOSE AS IF THEY WERE A LOT OF PEARS SAYING THIS ONE I'LL TAKE
154-293987-0003 THAT I WON'T TAKE BUT SHE REPLIED TO HIM WITH GREAT SPRIGHTLINESS AND CANDOUR MY DEAR SIR YOU ARE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN AND YOUR IDEAS ARE VERY OLD FASHIONED IF YOU THINK THAT I HAVE MADE A BAD CHOICE IN SO AND SO
154-293987-0004 AS THE MOST EXALTED PRINCESS ON EARTH IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT ALL THOSE POETS WHO SANG THE PRAISES OF LADIES UNDER THE FANCY NAMES THEY GIVE THEM HAD ANY SUCH MISTRESSES
154-293987-0005 NOTHING OF THE KIND THEY ONLY INVENT THEM FOR THE MOST PART TO FURNISH A SUBJECT FOR THEIR VERSES AND THAT THEY MAY PASS FOR LOVERS OR FOR MEN VALIANT ENOUGH TO BE SO
154-293987-0006 AND SO IT SUFFICES ME TO THINK AND BELIEVE THAT THE GOOD ALDONZA LORENZO IS FAIR AND VIRTUOUS AND AS TO HER PEDIGREE IT IS VERY LITTLE MATTER FOR NO ONE WILL EXAMINE INTO IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONFERRING ANY ORDER UPON HER

154-293987-0009 NEITHER MORE NOR LESS AND I PICTURE HER IN MY IMAGINATION AS I WOULD HAVE HER TO BE AS WELL IN BEAUTY AS IN CONDITION HELEN APPROACHES HER NOT NOR DOES LUCRETIA COME UP TO HER

154-293987-0027 HOWEVER NOT TO MISS ME AND LOSE THYSELF THE BEST PLAN WILL BE TO CUT SOME BRANCHES OF THE BROOM THAT IS SO ABUNDANT ABOUT HERE AND AS THOU GOEST TO LAY THEM AT INTERVALS UNTIL THOU HAST COME OUT UPON THE PLAIN

154-293987-0029 CUT SOME HE ASKED HIS MASTER'S BLESSING AND NOT WITHOUT MANY TEARS ON BOTH SIDES TOOK HIS LEAVE OF HIM
154-293987-0030 HAVE AS MUCH CARE AS OF HIS OWN PERSON HE SET OUT FOR THE PLAIN STREWING AT INTERVALS THE BRANCHES OF BROOM AS HIS MASTER HAD RECOMMENDED HIM AND SO HE WENT HIS WAY THOUGH DON QUIXOTE STILL ENTREATED HIM TO SEE HIM
154-293987-0031 IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SWEAR WITHOUT A WEIGHT ON MY CONSCIENCE THAT I HAD SEEN YOU DO MAD THINGS IT WOULD BE WELL FOR ME TO SEE IF IT WERE ONLY ONE THOUGH IN YOUR WORSHIP'S REMAINING HERE I HAVE SEEN A VERY GREAT ONE
154-293987-0032 DID I NOT TELL THEE SO SAID DON QUIXOTE WAIT SANCHO AND I WILL DO THEM IN THE SAYING OF A CREDO AND PULLING OFF HIS BREECHES IN ALL HASTE HE STRIPPED HIMSELF TO HIS SKIN AND HIS SHIRT AND THEN
154-293987-0033 WITHOUT MORE ADO HE CUT A COUPLE OF GAMBADOS IN THE AIR AND A COUPLE OF SOMERSAULTS HEELS OVER HEAD
154-293987-0034 AND FELT EASY AND SATISFIED IN HIS MIND THAT HE COULD SWEAR HE HAD LEFT HIS MASTER MAD AND SO WE WILL LEAVE HIM TO FOLLOW HIS ROAD UNTIL HIS RETURN
