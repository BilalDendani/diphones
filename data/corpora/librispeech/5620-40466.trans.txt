5620-40466-0000 SOMETHING ABOUT EXPLOSIVE BALLOONS AND THE WONDERS OF HYDROGEN ONE DAY THE PROFESSOR TOLD ME ABOUT SOME RAINFALL EXPERIMENTS
5620-40466-0001 THERE WAS A THEORY
5620-40466-0002 AND SOME GENTLEMEN IN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE WERE ANXIOUS TO SET OFF AS LOUD AN EXPLOSION AS POSSIBLE SAY A THOUSAND FEET UP IN THE AIR PROFESSOR MYERS RECEIVED THIS COMMISSION
5620-40466-0003 NO SAID MYERS I SHOULD CALL IT RATHER LARGE
5620-40466-0004 WELL SAID THE PROFESSOR I CAN SEE HIS EYES TWINKLING
5620-40466-0005 THEY TOOK THE BALLOON SOME MILES OUT OF WASHINGTON THE PROFESSOR INSISTED ON THIS
5620-40466-0006 AND SENT IT UP ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE WITH AN ANCHOR ROPE HOLDING IT AND A WIRE HANGING DOWN TO A LITTLE HAND DYNAMO OR BLASTING MACHINE AS THEY MADE READY TO TURN THIS DYNAMO PROFESSOR MYERS LAY FLAT ON HIS BACK
5620-40466-0007 EYES GLUED TO THE BALLOON CONFIDENT BUT CURIOUS THE HANDLE TURNED A SPARK JUMPED AT THE OTHER END AND THE BALL OF SILK
5620-40466-0008 ON THIS CAME THE SOUND
5620-40466-0009 LOUDER THAN ANY THUNDER CRASH OR ROAR OF CANNON IT FLATTENED MEN TO THE GROUND
5620-40466-0010 KILLED HUNDREDS OF LITTLE FISH IN A STREAM NEAR BY BURSTING THEIR AIR BLADDERS KNOCKED OVER A BOWLING ALLEY LIKE A HOUSE OF CARDS FRIGHTENED CATTLE AND BROUGHT DOWN RAIN IN TORRENTS WITHIN EIGHT MINUTES THE AGRICULTURAL GENTLEMEN WERE MORE THAN SATISFIED
5620-40466-0011 AND ADOPTED THE PROFESSOR'S SYSTEM FOR EXTENDED RAINFALL EXPERIMENTS ONLY THESE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS WERE REMOVED TO THE LONELY AND ARID PLAINS OF DISTANT TEXAS IT WASN'T MUCH FUN LIVING DOWN THERE SAID THE PROFESSOR
5620-40466-0012 BUT WE GOT RAIN WHENEVER WE WANTED IT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN I INQUIRED IF A VERY LARGE BALLOON FILLED WITH THIS EXPLOSIVE MIXTURE WERE SET OFF OVER A CROWDED CITY THE PROFESSOR SHOOK HIS HEAD
5620-40466-0013 IT WOULD WORK FEARFUL DESTRUCTION IF LARGE ENOUGH AND THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING SUCH A SIZE
5620-40466-0014 AND THE PEOPLE IN THEM IT WOULD DESTROY AN ARMY IN THE COURSE OF OUR TALKS I DISCOVERED A MYSTIC SIDE VERY UNEXPECTED IN THE PROFESSOR'S NATURE HE USED TO SPEAK OF HYDROGEN FOR INSTANCE
5620-40466-0015 AND I SEE NOTHING I HEAR NOTHING I SMELL NOTHING NONE OF MY SENSES ANSWER ANY CALL YET SOMEHOW STRANGELY IN A WAY I CAN'T EXPLAIN I PERCEIVE A PRESENCE
5620-40466-0016 IT WOULD NOT BE AT ALL THE SAME TO ME WERE THE BALLOON FILLED WITH AIR THOUGH IT WOULD BE THE SAME TO ALL MY SENSES AGAIN AND AGAIN I HAVE NOTED THIS THING THAT HYDROGEN MAKES ITSELF KNOWN TO MEN WHEN THEY ARE NEAR IT
5620-40466-0017 I MADE NO REMARK BUT BEGGED HIM TO GO ON
5620-40466-0018 THAT ARE VERY AMAZING IT IS THE LIGHTEST OF ALL THINGS IT PASSES THROUGH AND BEYOND ALL THINGS
5620-40466-0019 NOTHING WHO CAN SAY THAT IT IS NOT RELATED TO THE LAND OF NOTHING TO HE HESITATED YOU MEAN
5620-40466-0020 DON'T KNOW WHAT I MEAN I ONLY WONDER
5620-40466-0021 IN VAIN I TRIED TO GET THEM FREE BY POKING AT THEM WITH STICKS AND LONG HANDLED THINGS
5620-40466-0022 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO GET INSIDE THAT GREAT GAS BAG AND UNDO THE TANGLE WITH MY HANDS SO I CALLED FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MEN
5620-40466-0023 MINUTE I INTERRUPTED WERE YOU STANDING INSIDE THE BALLOON SO THAT YOU HAD TO BREATHE HYDROGEN THE PROFESSOR SMILED I STOOD INSIDE THE BALLOON BUT I BREATHED NOTHING
5620-40466-0024 YOU SEE I KNEW I COULD HOLD MY BREATH ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SECONDS BUT NO LONGER WELL WE CARRIED OUT THE PLAN AND I FREED THE CORDS IN LESS THAN MY LIMIT OF TIME
5620-40466-0025 IT IS TRUE I HAD AT VARIOUS TIMES TAKEN HYDROGEN INTO MY LUNGS BUT NEVER HAD I TRIED TO SPEAK IN HYDROGEN NOW WAS MY CHANCE
5620-40466-0026 I SHOUTED AS LOUD AS I COULD INSIDE THAT BALLOON THINK OF IT
5620-40466-0027 AND THE MEN A FEW FEET DISTANT WITH ONLY THE
5620-40466-0028 AND A GAS THAT WAS LIKE NOTHING
5620-40466-0029 TO THOSE OUTSIDE THE BALLOON IT WAS AS IF I HAD NOT OPENED MY LIPS THEY HEARD NOTHING NOT EVEN A WHISPER
5620-40466-0030 I BELIEVE YOU MIGHT FIRE A CANNON INSIDE A BAG OF HYDROGEN AND NO FAINTEST RUSTLE OF THE DISCHARGE WOULD REACH YOUR EARS SO YOU SEE A WORLD OF HYDROGEN WOULD BE A VOICELESS WORLD
5620-40466-0031 YES I HAVE BREATHED IT UP TO THE DANGER POINT I KNOW ALL THE SENSATIONS THERE IS FIRST A MILD EXHILARATION THEN A SENSE OF SICKENING AND HEAD THROBBING
5620-40466-0032 IN MAKING ASCENSIONS WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO BREATHE TOO MUCH GAS FROM THE BALLOON NECK WHICH HANGS OPEN OVER THE BASKET MORE THAN ONE AERONAUT HAS BEEN GRADUALLY OVERCOME WITHOUT REALIZING THAT HE WAS IN DANGER
5620-40466-0033 THE PROFESSOR WENT ON TO TELL OF OTHER SINGULAR THINGS ABOUT THIS SUBTLE GAS NOTABLY THAT SPEAKING WITHIN LIMITS THE HIGHER YOU WANT A BALLOON TO RISE THE LESS
5620-40466-0034 IF YOU FILL A BALLOON FULL OF HYDROGEN IT WILL RISE TO NO GREAT HEIGHT AND IS VERY APT TO BURST SINCE THE GAS HAS NO SPACE TO EXPAND IN
5620-40466-0035 AND MORE AS IT GOES UP EACH FOOT OF ADDED VOLUME DISPLACING A FOOT OF THE AIR OCEAN
5620-40466-0036 GENERAL HAZEN AND I SAID THE PROFESSOR ONCE PLANNED THAT SOME DAY WHEN WE GOT AN APPROPRIATION WE WOULD GO UP IN A BALLOON HAVING A CAPACITY OF SAY FORTY THOUSAND CUBIC FEET
5620-40466-0037 BUT CARRYING AT THE GROUND ONLY TEN THOUSAND CUBIC FEET OF HYDROGEN IN OTHER WORDS IN A SHRUNKEN QUARTER FILLED BALLOON
5620-40466-0038 OF COURSE AS WE ROSE AND THE AIR BECAME RAREFIED THIS HYDROGEN WOULD EXPAND AGAINST THE DECREASING AIR PRESSURE AND AT A HEIGHT OF TWO MILES OUR ORIGINAL TEN THOUSAND FEET OF GAS MIGHT HAVE SWELLED TO TWENTY THOUSAND FEET AT FIVE MILES TO THIRTY THOUSAND FEET
5620-40466-0039 BUT CERTAINLY WE CALCULATED TO THE GREATEST HEIGHT EVER REACHED BY A BALLOONIST HE EXPLAINED THAT THE BALLOON RECORD OF SEVEN MILES CLAIMED FOR GLAISCHER AND COXWELL THE ENGLISH AERONAUTS IS NOT RELIABLE SINCE THE BAROMETER USED IN THAT FAMOUS ASCENSION
5620-40466-0040 IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO COULD NOT REGISTER ABOVE FIVE MILES AND WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED BEYOND THAT HEIGHT
5620-40466-0041 INSTEAD OF NEARLY EMPTY OH EXCLAIMED THE PROFESSOR WITH REGRETFUL LOOK
