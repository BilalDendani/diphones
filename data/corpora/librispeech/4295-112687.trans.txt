4295-112687-0000 THE STATES OF BOHEMIA ALARMED AT THESE MIGHTY PREPARATIONS BEGAN ALSO TO SOLICIT FOREIGN ASSISTANCE AND TOGETHER WITH THAT SUPPORT WHICH THEY OBTAINED FROM THE EVANGELICAL UNION IN GERMANY
4295-112687-0001 THEY ENDEAVORED TO ESTABLISH CONNECTIONS WITH GREATER PRINCES THEY CAST THEIR EYES ON FREDERIC ELECTOR PALATINE THEY CONSIDERED THAT BESIDES COMMANDING NO DESPICABLE FORCE OF HIS OWN
4295-112687-0002 HE WAS SON IN LAW TO THE KING OF ENGLAND AND NEPHEW TO PRINCE MAURICE WHOSE AUTHORITY WAS BECOME ALMOST ABSOLUTE IN THE UNITED PROVINCES THEY HOPED THAT THESE PRINCES MOVED BY THE CONNECTIONS OF BLOOD
4295-112687-0003 AS WELL AS BY THE TIE OF THEIR COMMON RELIGION WOULD INTEREST THEMSELVES IN ALL THE FORTUNES OF FREDERIC AND WOULD PROMOTE HIS GREATNESS THEY THEREFORE MADE HIM A TENDER OF THEIR CROWN WHICH THEY CONSIDERED AS ELECTIVE
4295-112687-0004 AND THE YOUNG PALATINE STIMULATED BY AMBITION WITHOUT CONSULTING EITHER JAMES OR MAURICE WHOSE OPPOSITION HE FORESAW IMMEDIATELY ACCEPTED THE OFFER AND MARCHED ALL HIS FORCES INTO BOHEMIA IN SUPPORT OF HIS NEW SUBJECTS
4295-112687-0005 THE NEWS OF THESE EVENTS NO SOONER REACHED ENGLAND THAN THE WHOLE KINGDOM WAS ON FIRE TO ENGAGE IN THE QUARREL SCARCELY WAS THE ARDOR GREATER WITH WHICH ALL THE STATES OF EUROPE
4295-112687-0006 IN FORMER AGES FLEW TO RESCUE THE HOLY LAND FROM THE DOMINION OF INFIDELS THE NATION WAS AS YET SINCERELY ATTACHED TO THE BLOOD OF THEIR MONARCHS AND THEY CONSIDERED THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE PALATINE WHO HAD MARRIED A DAUGHTER OF ENGLAND
4295-112687-0007 AS VERY CLOSE AND INTIMATE AND WHEN THEY HEARD OF CATHOLICS CARRYING ON WARS AND PERSECUTIONS AGAINST PROTESTANTS THEY THOUGHT THEIR OWN INTEREST DEEPLY CONCERNED AND REGARDED THEIR NEUTRALITY AS A BASE DESERTION OF THE CAUSE OF GOD
4295-112687-0008 AND OF HIS HOLY RELIGION IN SUCH A QUARREL THEY WOULD GLADLY HAVE MARCHED TO THE OPPOSITE EXTREMITY OF EUROPE HAVE PLUNGED THEMSELVES INTO A CHAOS OF GERMAN POLITICS AND HAVE EXPENDED ALL THE BLOOD AND TREASURE OF THE NATION
4295-112687-0009 SO EXALTED WAS HIS IDEA OF THE RIGHTS OF KINGS THAT HE CONCLUDED SUBJECTS MUST EVER BE IN THE WRONG WHEN THEY STOOD IN OPPOSITION TO THOSE WHO HAD ACQUIRED
4295-112687-0010 OR ASSUMED THAT MAJESTIC TITLE THUS EVEN IN MEASURES FOUNDED ON TRUE POLITICS JAMES INTERMIXED SO MANY NARROW PREJUDICES AS DIMINISHED HIS AUTHORITY
4295-112687-0011 HASTENED TO A CRISIS FERDINAND LEVIED A GREAT FORCE UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE DUKE OF BAVARIA AND THE COUNT OF BUCQUOY AND ADVANCED UPON HIS ENEMY IN BOHEMIA
4295-112687-0012 IN THE LOW COUNTRIES SPINOLA COLLECTED A VETERAN ARMY OF THIRTY THOUSAND MEN WHEN EDMONDS THE KING'S RESIDENT AT BRUSSELS MADE REMONSTRANCES TO THE ARCHDUKE ALBERT
4295-112687-0013 HE WAS ANSWERED THAT THE ORDERS FOR THIS ARMAMENT HAD BEEN TRANSMITTED TO SPINOLA FROM MADRID AND THAT HE ALONE KNEW THE SECRET DESTINATION OF IT SPINOLA AGAIN TOLD THE MINISTER THAT HIS ORDERS WERE STILL SEALED
4295-112687-0014 OF POLITICS THAT HOWEVER EXORBITANT THE AUSTRIAN GREATNESS
4295-112687-0015 THE DANGER WAS STILL TOO DISTANT TO GIVE ANY JUST ALARM TO ENGLAND THAT MIGHTY RESISTANCE WOULD YET BE MADE BY SO MANY POTENT AND WARLIKE PRINCES AND STATES IN GERMANY ERE THEY WOULD YIELD THEIR NECK TO THE YOKE THAT FRANCE
4295-112687-0016 NOW ENGAGED TO CONTRACT A DOUBLE ALLIANCE WITH THE AUSTRIAN FAMILY MUST NECESSARILY BE SOON ROUSED FROM HER LETHARGY AND OPPOSE THE PROGRESS OF SO HATED A RIVAL THAT IN THE FURTHER ADVANCE OF CONQUESTS
4295-112687-0017 WOULD WASTE THE BLOOD AND TREASURE OF THE ENGLISH NATION WITHOUT ANY HOPES OF SUCCESS THAT A SEA WAR INDEED MIGHT BE BOTH SAFE AND SUCCESSFUL AGAINST SPAIN BUT WOULD NOT AFFECT THE ENEMY IN SUCH VITAL PARTS
4295-112687-0018 WHETHER PEACE AND COMMERCE WITH SPAIN OR THE UNCERTAIN HOPES OF PLUNDER AND OF CONQUEST IN THE INDIES WERE PREFERABLE A QUESTION WHICH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE KING'S REIGN HAD ALREADY BEEN DECIDED AND PERHAPS WITH REASON
4295-112687-0019 IN FAVOR OF THE FORMER ADVANTAGES JAMES MIGHT HAVE DEFENDED HIS PACIFIC MEASURES BY SUCH PLAUSIBLE ARGUMENTS BUT THESE THOUGH THE CHIEF SEEM NOT TO HAVE BEEN THE SOLE MOTIVES WHICH SWAYED HIM
4295-112687-0020 HE HAD ENTERTAINED THE NOTION THAT AS HIS OWN JUSTICE AND MODERATION HAD SHONE OUT SO CONSPICUOUSLY THROUGHOUT ALL THESE TRANSACTIONS THE WHOLE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA THOUGH NOT AWED BY THE POWER OF ENGLAND WOULD WILLINGLY
4295-112687-0021 FROM MERE RESPECT TO HIS VIRTUE SUBMIT THEMSELVES TO SO EQUITABLE AN ARBITRATION HE FLATTERED HIMSELF THAT AFTER HE HAD FORMED AN INTIMATE CONNECTION WITH THE SPANISH MONARCH BY MEANS OF HIS SON'S MARRIAGE
4295-112687-0022 THE RESTITUTION OF THE PALATINATE MIGHT BE PROCURED FROM THE MOTIVE ALONE OF FRIENDSHIP AND PERSONAL ATTACHMENT HE PERCEIVED NOT THAT HIS UNACTIVE VIRTUE THE MORE IT WAS EXTOLLED THE GREATER DISREGARD WAS IT EXPOSED TO
4295-112687-0023 AS THE MEANS OF PROCURING SUCH EXTRAORDINARY ADVANTAGES HIS UNWARLIKE DISPOSITION INCREASED BY AGE RIVETTED HIM STILL FASTER IN HIS ERRORS
4295-112687-0024 AND DETERMINED HIM TO SEEK THE RESTORATION OF HIS SON IN LAW BY REMONSTRANCES AND ENTREATIES BY ARGUMENTS AND EMBASSIES
4295-112687-0025 I ASSURE YOU SAID HE HAD I BEFORE HEARD THESE THINGS COMPLAINED OF I WOULD HAVE DONE THE OFFICE OF A JUST KING AND OUT OF PARLIAMENT
4295-112687-0026 TO TAKE PRESENTS AND IT IS PRETENDED THAT BACON WHO FOLLOWED THE SAME DANGEROUS PRACTICE HAD STILL IN THE SEAT OF JUSTICE PRESERVED THE INTEGRITY OF A JUDGE AND HAD GIVEN JUST DECREES AGAINST THOSE VERY PERSONS
4295-112687-0027 COMPLAINTS ROSE THE LOUDER ON THAT ACCOUNT AND AT LAST REACHED THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WHO SENT UP AN IMPEACHMENT AGAINST HIM TO THE PEERS
4295-112687-0028 THE CHANCELLOR CONSCIOUS OF GUILT DEPRECATED THE VENGEANCE OF HIS JUDGES AND ENDEAVORED BY A GENERAL AVOWAL TO ESCAPE THE CONFUSION OF A STRICTER INQUIRY
4295-112687-0029 TO BE FOREVER INCAPABLE OF ANY OFFICE PLACE OR EMPLOYMENT AND NEVER AGAIN TO SIT IN PARLIAMENT OR COME WITHIN THE VERGE OF THE COURT THIS DREADFUL SENTENCE DREADFUL TO A MAN OF NICE SENSIBILITY TO HONOR
4295-112687-0030 HE SURVIVED FIVE YEARS AND BEING RELEASED IN A LITTLE TIME FROM THE TOWER
4295-112687-0031 AND A DEPRESSED SPIRIT
4295-112687-0032 WHICH HAVE MADE HIS GUILT OR WEAKNESSES BE FORGOTTEN OR OVERLOOKED BY POSTERITY IN CONSIDERATION OF HIS GREAT MERIT THE KING REMITTED HIS FINE AS WELL AS ALL THE OTHER PARTS OF HIS SENTENCE
4295-112687-0033 CONFERRED ON HIM A LARGE PENSION OF ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR AND EMPLOYED EVERY EXPEDIENT TO ALLEVIATE THE WEIGHT OF HIS AGE AND MISFORTUNES AND THAT GREAT PHILOSOPHER AT LAST ACKNOWLEDGED WITH REGRET
4295-112687-0034 MUST PROCEED FROM THEM AND TO THIS PRINCIPLE THEY WERE CHIEFLY BEHOLDEN FOR THE REGARD AND CONSIDERATION OF THE PUBLIC IN THE EXECUTION OF THIS OFFICE THEY NOW KEPT THEIR EARS OPEN TO COMPLAINTS OF EVERY KIND
4295-112687-0035 AND THEY CARRIED THEIR RESEARCHES INTO MANY GRIEVANCES WHICH THOUGH OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE COULD NOT BE TOUCHED ON WITHOUT SENSIBLY AFFECTING THE KING AND HIS MINISTERS
4295-112687-0036 THE PREROGATIVE SEEMED EVERY MOMENT TO BE INVADED THE KING'S AUTHORITY IN EVERY ARTICLE WAS DISPUTED AND JAMES WHO WAS WILLING TO CORRECT THE ABUSES OF HIS POWER WOULD NOT SUBMIT TO HAVE HIS POWER ITSELF QUESTIONED AND DENIED
4295-112687-0037 WHICH WAS REFUSED BY THE UPPER HOUSE THE KING REGARDED THIS PROJECT OF A JOINT PETITION
