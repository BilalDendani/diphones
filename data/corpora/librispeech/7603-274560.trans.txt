7603-274560-0000 SOME ONE DID INTRODUCE ME TO THE GENTLEMAN I AM SURE AT SOME PUBLIC MEETING I KNOW VERY WELL HELD ABOUT SOMETHING OF GREAT IMPORTANCE NO DOUBT AT SOME PLACE OR OTHER I FEEL CONVINCED
7603-274560-0001 WHOSE NAME I HAVE UNACCOUNTABLY FORGOTTEN THE TRUTH IS THAT THE INTRODUCTION WAS ATTENDED UPON MY PART WITH A DEGREE OF ANXIOUS EMBARRASSMENT WHICH OPERATED TO PREVENT ANY DEFINITE IMPRESSIONS OF EITHER TIME OR PLACE
7603-274560-0002 I AM CONSTITUTIONALLY NERVOUS THIS WITH ME IS A FAMILY FAILING AND I CAN'T HELP IT IN ESPECIAL THE SLIGHTEST APPEARANCE OF MYSTERY OF ANY POINT I CANNOT EXACTLY COMPREHEND
7603-274560-0003 PUTS ME AT ONCE INTO A PITIABLE STATE OF AGITATION THERE WAS SOMETHING AS IT WERE REMARKABLE YES REMARKABLE ALTHOUGH THIS IS BUT A FEEBLE TERM TO EXPRESS MY FULL MEANING
7603-274560-0004 ABOUT THE ENTIRE INDIVIDUALITY OF THE PERSONAGE IN QUESTION HE WAS PERHAPS SIX FEET IN HEIGHT AND OF A PRESENCE SINGULARLY COMMANDING THERE WAS AN AIR DISTINGUE PERVADING THE WHOLE MAN
7603-274560-0005 WHICH SPOKE OF HIGH BREEDING AND HINTED AT HIGH BIRTH UPON THIS TOPIC THE TOPIC OF SMITH'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE I HAVE A KIND OF MELANCHOLY SATISFACTION IN BEING MINUTE
7603-274560-0006 HIS HEAD OF HAIR WOULD HAVE DONE HONOR TO A BRUTUS NOTHING COULD BE MORE RICHLY FLOWING OR POSSESS A BRIGHTER GLOSS IT WAS OF A JETTY BLACK
7603-274560-0007 WHICH WAS ALSO THE COLOR OR MORE PROPERLY THE NO COLOR OF HIS UNIMAGINABLE WHISKERS YOU PERCEIVE I CANNOT SPEAK OF THESE LATTER WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY
7603-274560-0008 AT ALL EVENTS THEY ENCIRCLED AND AT TIMES PARTIALLY OVERSHADOWED A MOUTH UTTERLY UNEQUALLED HERE WERE THE MOST ENTIRELY EVEN AND THE MOST BRILLIANTLY WHITE OF ALL CONCEIVABLE TEETH
7603-274560-0009 OF SURPASSING CLEARNESS MELODY AND STRENGTH IN THE MATTER OF EYES ALSO MY ACQUAINTANCE WAS PRE EMINENTLY ENDOWED EITHER ONE OF SUCH A PAIR WAS WORTH A COUPLE OF THE ORDINARY OCULAR ORGANS
7603-274560-0010 THEY WERE OF A DEEP HAZEL EXCEEDINGLY LARGE AND LUSTROUS
7603-274560-0011 JUST THAT AMOUNT OF INTERESTING OBLIQUITY WHICH GIVES PREGNANCY TO EXPRESSION THE BUST OF THE GENERAL WAS UNQUESTIONABLY THE FINEST BUST I EVER SAW
7603-274560-0012 FOR YOUR LIFE YOU COULD NOT HAVE FOUND A FAULT WITH ITS WONDERFUL PROPORTION THIS RARE PECULIARITY SET OFF TO GREAT ADVANTAGE A PAIR OF SHOULDERS
7603-274560-0013 WHICH WOULD HAVE CALLED UP A BLUSH OF CONSCIOUS INFERIORITY INTO THE COUNTENANCE OF THE MARBLE APOLLO I HAVE A PASSION FOR FINE SHOULDERS AND MAY SAY THAT I NEVER BEHELD THEM IN PERFECTION BEFORE
7603-274560-0014 THE ARMS ALTOGETHER WERE ADMIRABLY MODELLED NOR WERE THE LOWER LIMBS LESS SUPERB THESE WERE INDEED THE NE PLUS ULTRA OF GOOD LEGS EVERY CONNOISSEUR IN SUCH MATTERS ADMITTED THE LEGS TO BE GOOD
7603-274560-0015 THERE WAS NEITHER TOO MUCH FLESH NOR TOO LITTLE NEITHER RUDENESS NOR FRAGILITY I COULD NOT IMAGINE A MORE GRACEFUL CURVE THAN THAT OF THE OS FEMORIS AND THERE WAS JUST THAT DUE GENTLE PROMINENCE IN THE REAR OF THE FIBULA
7603-274560-0016 WHICH GOES TO THE CONFORMATION OF A PROPERLY PROPORTIONED CALF I WISH TO GOD MY YOUNG AND TALENTED FRIEND CHIPONCHIPINO THE SCULPTOR HAD BUT SEEN THE LEGS OF BREVET BRIGADIER GENERAL JOHN A B C SMITH
7603-274560-0017 BUT ALTHOUGH MEN SO ABSOLUTELY FINE LOOKING ARE NEITHER AS PLENTY AS REASONS OR BLACKBERRIES STILL I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO BELIEVE THAT THE REMARKABLE SOMETHING TO WHICH I ALLUDED JUST NOW
7603-274560-0018 LAY ALTOGETHER OR INDEED AT ALL IN THE SUPREME EXCELLENCE OF HIS BODILY ENDOWMENTS PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE TRACED TO THE MANNER YET HERE AGAIN I COULD NOT PRETEND TO BE POSITIVE
7603-274560-0019 THERE WAS A PRIMNESS NOT TO SAY STIFFNESS IN HIS CARRIAGE A DEGREE OF MEASURED AND IF I MAY SO EXPRESS IT OF RECTANGULAR PRECISION ATTENDING HIS EVERY MOVEMENT WHICH OBSERVED IN A MORE DIMINUTIVE FIGURE
7603-274560-0020 WOULD HAVE HAD THE LEAST LITTLE SAVOR IN THE WORLD OF AFFECTATION POMPOSITY OR CONSTRAINT BUT WHICH NOTICED IN A GENTLEMAN OF HIS UNDOUBTED DIMENSIONS WAS READILY PLACED TO THE ACCOUNT OF RESERVE
7603-274560-0021 OF A COMMENDABLE SENSE IN SHORT OF WHAT IS DUE TO THE DIGNITY OF COLOSSAL PROPORTION THE KIND FRIEND WHO PRESENTED ME TO GENERAL SMITH WHISPERED IN MY EAR SOME FEW WORDS OF COMMENT UPON THE MAN
7603-274560-0022 HE WAS A REMARKABLE MAN A VERY REMARKABLE MAN INDEED ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE MEN OF THE AGE HE WAS AN ESPECIAL FAVORITE TOO WITH THE LADIES
7603-274560-0023 CHIEFLY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS HIGH REPUTATION FOR COURAGE IN THAT POINT HE IS UNRIVALLED INDEED HE IS A PERFECT DESPERADO A DOWN RIGHT FIRE EATER AND NO MISTAKE
7603-274560-0024 SAID MY FRIEND HERE DROPPING HIS VOICE EXCESSIVELY LOW AND THRILLING ME WITH THE MYSTERY OF HIS TONE A DOWNRIGHT FIRE EATER AND NO MISTAKE SHOWED THAT I SHOULD SAY
7603-274560-0025 TO SOME PURPOSE IN THE LATE TREMENDOUS SWAMP FIGHT AWAY DOWN SOUTH WITH THE BUGABOO AND KICKAPOO INDIANS HERE MY FRIEND OPENED HIS EYES TO SOME EXTENT BLESS MY SOUL
7603-274560-0026 BLOOD AND THUNDER AND ALL THAT PRODIGIES OF VALOR HEARD OF HIM OF COURSE YOU KNOW HE'S THE MAN MAN ALIVE HOW DO YOU DO WHY HOW ARE YE
7603-274560-0027 HERE INTERRUPTED THE GENERAL HIMSELF SEIZING MY COMPANION BY THE HAND AS HE DREW NEAR
7603-274560-0028 I THEN THOUGHT AND I THINK SO STILL
7603-274560-0029 NOR BEHELD A FINER SET OF TEETH BUT I MUST SAY THAT I WAS SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION JUST AT THAT MOMENT AS OWING TO THE WHISPERS AND INSINUATIONS AFORESAID
7603-274560-0030 MY INTEREST HAD BEEN GREATLY EXCITED IN THE HERO OF THE BUGABOO AND KICKAPOO CAMPAIGN HOWEVER THE DELIGHTFULLY LUMINOUS CONVERSATION OF BREVET BRIGADIER GENERAL JOHN A B C SMITH SOON COMPLETELY DISSIPATED THIS CHAGRIN
7603-274560-0031 MY FRIEND LEAVING US IMMEDIATELY WE HAD QUITE A LONG TETE A TETE AND I WAS NOT ONLY PLEASED BUT REALLY INSTRUCTED I NEVER HEARD A MORE FLUENT TALKER OR A MAN OF GREATER GENERAL INFORMATION
7603-274560-0032 WITH BECOMING MODESTY HE FOREBORE NEVERTHELESS TO TOUCH UPON THE THEME I HAD JUST THEN MOST AT HEART I MEAN THE MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING THE BUGABOO WAR AND ON MY OWN PART
7603-274560-0033 WHAT I CONCEIVE TO BE A PROPER SENSE OF DELICACY FORBADE ME TO BROACH THE SUBJECT ALTHOUGH IN TRUTH I WAS EXCEEDINGLY TEMPTED TO DO SO I PERCEIVED TOO THAT THE GALLANT SOLDIER PREFERRED TOPICS OF PHILOSOPHICAL INTEREST
7603-274560-0034 AND THAT HE DELIGHTED ESPECIALLY IN COMMENTING UPON THE RAPID MARCH OF MECHANICAL INVENTION INDEED LEAD HIM WHERE I WOULD THIS WAS A POINT TO WHICH HE INVARIABLY CAME BACK
7603-274560-0035 AND LIVE IN A WONDERFUL AGE PARACHUTES AND RAIL ROADS MAN TRAPS AND SPRING GUNS OUR STEAM BOATS ARE UPON EVERY SEA AND THE NASSAU BALLOON PACKET IS ABOUT TO RUN REGULAR TRIPS
7603-274560-0036 FARE EITHER WAY ONLY TWENTY POUNDS STERLING BETWEEN LONDON AND TIMBUCTOO AND WHO SHALL CALCULATE THE IMMENSE INFLUENCE UPON SOCIAL LIFE
7603-274560-0037 UPON ARTS UPON COMMERCE UPON LITERATURE WHICH WILL BE THE IMMEDIATE RESULT OF THE GREAT PRINCIPLES OF ELECTRO MAGNETICS NOR IS THIS ALL LET ME ASSURE YOU
7603-274560-0038 THE MOST INGENIOUS AND LET ME ADD MISTER MISTER THOMPSON I BELIEVE IS YOUR NAME LET ME ADD I SAY THE MOST USEFUL
7603-274560-0039 THE MOST TRULY USEFUL MECHANICAL CONTRIVANCES ARE DAILY SPRINGING UP LIKE MUSHROOMS IF I MAY SO EXPRESS MYSELF
7603-274560-0040 THOMPSON TO BE SURE IS NOT MY NAME BUT IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT I LEFT GENERAL SMITH WITH A HEIGHTENED INTEREST IN THE MAN WITH AN EXALTED OPINION OF HIS CONVERSATIONAL POWERS
7603-274560-0041 AND A DEEP SENSE OF THE VALUABLE PRIVILEGES WE ENJOY IN LIVING IN THIS AGE OF MECHANICAL INVENTION MY CURIOSITY HOWEVER HAD NOT BEEN ALTOGETHER SATISFIED
7603-274560-0042 AND I RESOLVED TO PROSECUTE IMMEDIATE INQUIRY AMONG MY ACQUAINTANCES TOUCHING THE BREVET BRIGADIER GENERAL HIMSELF AND PARTICULARLY RESPECTING THE TREMENDOUS EVENTS QUORUM PARS MAGNA FUIT
7603-274560-0043 DURING THE BUGABOO AND KICKAPOO CAMPAIGN THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF AND WHICH HORRESCO REFERENS I DID NOT IN THE LEAST SCRUPLE TO SEIZE OCCURRED AT THE CHURCH OF THE REVEREND DOCTOR DRUMMUMMUPP
7603-274560-0044 WHERE I FOUND MYSELF ESTABLISHED ONE SUNDAY JUST AT SERMON TIME NOT ONLY IN THE PEW BUT BY THE SIDE OF THAT WORTHY AND COMMUNICATIVE LITTLE FRIEND OF MINE MISS TABITHA T
7603-274560-0045 THAT PERSON IT WAS CLEAR TO ME WAS MISS TABITHA T WE TELEGRAPHED A FEW SIGNALS
7603-274560-0046 A BRISK TETE A TETE SMITH SAID SHE IN REPLY TO MY VERY EARNEST INQUIRY SMITH WHY NOT GENERAL JOHN A B C BLESS ME I THOUGHT YOU KNEW ALL ABOUT HIM
7603-274560-0047 THIS IS A WONDERFULLY INVENTIVE AGE HORRID AFFAIR THAT A BLOODY SET OF WRETCHES THOSE KICKAPOOS FOUGHT LIKE A HERO PRODIGIES OF VALOR IMMORTAL RENOWN SMITH
7603-274560-0048 HERE BROKE IN DOCTOR DRUMMUMMUPP AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE AND WITH A THUMP THAT CAME NEAR KNOCKING THE PULPIT ABOUT OUR EARS
7603-274560-0049 I STARTED TO THE EXTREMITY OF THE PEW AND PERCEIVED BY THE ANIMATED LOOKS OF THE DIVINE THAT THE WRATH WHICH HAD NEARLY PROVED FATAL TO THE PULPIT HAD BEEN EXCITED BY THE WHISPERS OF THE LADY AND MYSELF
7603-274560-0050 THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT
7603-274560-0051 AND LISTENED IN ALL THE MARTYRDOM OF DIGNIFIED SILENCE TO THE BALANCE OF THAT VERY CAPITAL DISCOURSE NEXT EVENING FOUND ME A SOMEWHAT LATE VISITOR AT THE RANTIPOLE THEATRE
7603-274560-0052 WHERE I FELT SURE OF SATISFYING MY CURIOSITY AT ONCE
7603-274560-0053 CLIMAX WAS DOING IAGO TO A VERY CROWDED HOUSE AND I EXPERIENCED SOME LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN MAKING MY WISHES UNDERSTOOD ESPECIALLY AS OUR BOX WAS NEXT THE SLIPS AND COMPLETELY OVERLOOKED THE STAGE
7603-274560-0054 SAID MISS ARABELLA AS SHE AT LENGTH COMPREHENDED THE PURPORT OF MY QUERY
7603-274560-0055 SMITH INQUIRED MIRANDA MUSINGLY GOD BLESS ME DID YOU EVER BEHOLD A FINER FIGURE NEVER MADAM BUT DO TELL ME OR SO INIMITABLE GRACE
7603-274560-0056 NEVER UPON MY WORD BUT PRAY INFORM ME OR SO JUST AN APPRECIATION OF STAGE EFFECT
7603-274560-0057 IN A WAY THAT I COULDN'T STAND AND I WOULDN'T I LEFT THE MISSES COGNOSCENTI IMMEDIATELY WENT BEHIND THE SCENES FORTHWITH
7603-274560-0058 AND GAVE THE BEGGARLY SCOUNDREL SUCH A THRASHING AS I TRUST HE WILL REMEMBER TO THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
7603-274560-0059 I WAS CONFIDENT THAT I SHOULD MEET WITH NO SIMILAR DISAPPOINTMENT
7603-274560-0060 THE SOLUTION OF WHICH HAD BECOME A MATTER SO ESSENTIAL TO MY PEACE SMITH SAID MY PARTNER WHY NOT GENERAL JOHN A B C HORRID AFFAIR THAT WASN'T IT DIAMONDS DID YOU SAY

7603-274560-0064 STILL I CONSOLED MYSELF WITH THE REFLECTION THAT THE TIDE OF ILL LUCK WOULD NOT RUN AGAINST ME FOREVER AND SO DETERMINED TO MAKE A BOLD PUSH FOR INFORMATION
7603-274560-0065 SMITH SAID MISSUS P AS WE TWIRLED ABOUT TOGETHER
7603-274560-0066 WHY NOT GENERAL JOHN A B C DREADFUL BUSINESS THAT OF THE BUGABOOS WASN'T IT

7603-274560-0071 ALTHOUGH I PRONOUNCED WITH GREAT PROMPTNESS THAT THE TRUE TITLE WAS MAN FRIDAY AND NOT BY ANY MEANS MAN FRED
7603-274560-0072 AND I RESOLVED TO CALL AT ONCE UPON MY PARTICULAR FRIEND MISTER THEODORE SINIVATE FOR I KNEW THAT HERE AT LEAST I SHOULD GET SOMETHING LIKE DEFINITE INFORMATION SMITH
7603-274560-0073 SAID HE IN HIS WELL KNOWN PECULIAR WAY OF DRAWLING OUT HIS SYLLABLES

7603-274560-0080 REALLY AND TRULY AND CONSCIENTIOUSLY THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT AFFAIR OF SMITH'S
7603-274560-0081 NO O O SAID HE LOOKING WISE
7603-274560-0082 AND POSITIVE INSULT AND SO LEFT THE HOUSE AT ONCE IN HIGH DUDGEON WITH A FIRM RESOLVE TO CALL MY FRIEND MISTER SINIVATE TO A SPEEDY ACCOUNT FOR HIS UNGENTLEMANLY CONDUCT AND ILL BREEDING IN THE MEANTIME HOWEVER
7603-274560-0083 I HAD NO NOTION OF BEING THWARTED TOUCHING THE INFORMATION I DESIRED THERE WAS ONE RESOURCE LEFT ME YET I WOULD GO TO THE FOUNTAIN HEAD I WOULD CALL FORTHWITH UPON THE GENERAL HIMSELF AND DEMAND
7603-274560-0084 IN EXPLICIT TERMS A SOLUTION OF THIS ABOMINABLE PIECE OF MYSTERY HERE AT LEAST THERE SHOULD BE NO CHANCE FOR EQUIVOCATION I WOULD BE PLAIN POSITIVE PEREMPTORY AS SHORT AS PIE CRUST
7603-274560-0085 AS CONCISE AS TACITUS OR MONTESQUIEU IT WAS EARLY WHEN I CALLED AND THE GENERAL WAS DRESSING BUT I PLEADED URGENT BUSINESS
7603-274560-0086 WHO REMAINED IN ATTENDANCE DURING MY VISIT AS I ENTERED THE CHAMBER I LOOKED ABOUT OF COURSE FOR THE OCCUPANT BUT DID NOT IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVE HIM
7603-274560-0087 I FAIRLY SHOUTED WITH TERROR AND MADE OFF AT A TANGENT INTO THE FARTHEST EXTREMITY OF THE ROOM GOD BLESS ME MY DEAR FELLOW HERE AGAIN WHISTLED THE BUNDLE
7603-274560-0088 AND THEN IT STOOD UP BEFORE MY EYES AND A BLOODY ACTION IT WAS CONTINUED THE THING AS IF IN A SOLILOQUY BUT THEN ONE MUSTN'T FIGHT WITH THE BUGABOOS AND KICKAPOOS
7603-274560-0089 TURNING TO ME IS DECIDEDLY THE
7603-274560-0090 HERE POMPEY SCREWED ON AN ARM
7603-274560-0091 THAT YOU MAY SAY NOW YOU DOG SLIP ON MY SHOULDERS AND BOSOM PETTITT MAKES THE BEST SHOULDERS BUT FOR A BOSOM YOU WILL HAVE TO GO TO DUCROW BOSOM SAID I
7603-274560-0092 WILL YOU NEVER BE READY WITH THAT WIG SCALPING IS A ROUGH PROCESS AFTER ALL BUT THEN YOU CAN PROCURE SUCH A CAPITAL SCRATCH AT DE L'ORME'S
7603-274560-0093 YOU HAD BETTER GO TO PARMLY'S AT ONCE HIGH PRICES BUT EXCELLENT WORK I SWALLOWED SOME VERY CAPITAL ARTICLES THOUGH
7603-274560-0094 WHEN THE BIG BUGABOO RAMMED ME DOWN WITH THE BUTT END OF HIS RIFLE BUTT END RAM DOWN MY EYE O YES BY THE BY MY EYE HERE
7603-274560-0095 I NOW BEGAN VERY CLEARLY TO PERCEIVE THAT THE OBJECT BEFORE ME WAS NOTHING MORE NOR LESS THAN MY NEW ACQUAINTANCE BREVET BRIGADIER GENERAL JOHN A B C SMITH
7603-274560-0096 A VERY STRIKING DIFFERENCE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE PERSONAL MAN THE VOICE HOWEVER STILL PUZZLED ME NO LITTLE BUT EVEN THIS APPARENT MYSTERY WAS SPEEDILY CLEARED UP
7603-274560-0097 WENT UP TO HIS MASTER OPENED HIS MOUTH WITH THE KNOWING AIR OF A HORSE JOCKEY AND ADJUSTED THEREIN A SOMEWHAT SINGULAR LOOKING MACHINE IN A VERY DEXTEROUS MANNER THAT I COULD NOT ALTOGETHER COMPREHEND
7603-274560-0098 THE ALTERATION HOWEVER IN THE ENTIRE EXPRESSION OF THE GENERAL'S COUNTENANCE WAS INSTANTANEOUS AND SURPRISING WHEN HE AGAIN SPOKE
7603-274560-0099 HIS VOICE HAD RESUMED ALL THAT RICH MELODY AND STRENGTH WHICH I HAD NOTICED UPON OUR ORIGINAL INTRODUCTION D N THE VAGABONDS SAID HE IN SO CLEAR A TONE THAT I POSITIVELY STARTED AT THE CHANGE
7603-274560-0100 BUT TOOK THE TROUBLE TO CUT OFF AT LEAST SEVEN EIGHTHS OF MY TONGUE THERE ISN'T BONFANTI'S EQUAL HOWEVER IN AMERICA FOR REALLY GOOD ARTICLES OF THIS DESCRIPTION
7603-274560-0101 I CAN RECOMMEND YOU TO HIM WITH CONFIDENCE HERE THE GENERAL BOWED AND ASSURE YOU THAT I HAVE THE GREATEST PLEASURE IN SO DOING I ACKNOWLEDGED HIS KINDNESS IN MY BEST MANNER
7603-274560-0102 AND TOOK LEAVE OF HIM AT ONCE WITH A PERFECT UNDERSTANDING OF THE TRUE STATE OF AFFAIRS WITH A FULL COMPREHENSION OF THE MYSTERY WHICH HAD TROUBLED ME SO LONG IT WAS EVIDENT IT WAS A CLEAR CASE
7603-274560-0103 BREVET BRIGADIER GENERAL JOHN A B C SMITH WAS THE MAN
