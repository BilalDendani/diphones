7912-105669-0000 HAD SUFFICIENTLY PREPARED THE NATION FOR A BREACH WITH THE SOVEREIGN PONTIFF AND MEN HAD PENETRATION ENOUGH TO DISCOVER ABUSES WHICH WERE PLAINLY CALCULATED FOR THE TEMPORAL ADVANTAGES OF THE HIERARCHY AND WHICH THEY FOUND DESTRUCTIVE OF THEIR OWN
7912-105669-0001 THESE SUBJECTS SEEMED PROPORTIONED TO HUMAN UNDERSTANDING AND EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO FELT THE POWER OF INTEREST IN THEIR OWN BREASTS COULD PERCEIVE THE PURPOSE OF THOSE NUMEROUS INVENTIONS WHICH THE INTERESTED SPIRIT OF THE ROMAN PONTIFF HAD INTRODUCED INTO RELIGION
7912-105669-0002 BUT WHEN THE REFORMERS PROCEEDED THENCE TO DISPUTE CONCERNING THE NATURE OF THE SACRAMENTS THE OPERATIONS OF GRACE THE TERMS OF ACCEPTANCE WITH THE DEITY
7912-105669-0003 THE PROFOUND IGNORANCE IN WHICH BOTH THE CLERGY AND LAITY FORMERLY LIVED AND THEIR FREEDOM FROM THEOLOGICAL ALTERCATIONS
7912-105669-0004 HAD PRODUCED A SINCERE BUT INDOLENT ACQUIESCENCE IN RECEIVED OPINIONS AND THE MULTITUDE WERE NEITHER ATTACHED TO THEM BY TOPICS OF REASONING
7912-105669-0005 NOR BY THOSE PREJUDICES AND ANTIPATHIES AGAINST OPPONENTS WHICH HAVE EVER A MORE NATURAL AND POWERFUL INFLUENCE OVER THEM AS SOON THEREFORE
7912-105669-0006 AS A NEW OPINION WAS ADVANCED SUPPORTED BY SUCH AN AUTHORITY AS TO CALL UP THEIR ATTENTION THEY FELT THEIR CAPACITY TOTALLY UNFITTED FOR SUCH DISQUISITIONS
7912-105669-0007 HENCE THE QUICK AND VIOLENT MOVEMENTS BY WHICH THE PEOPLE WERE AGITATED EVEN IN THE MOST OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS HENCE THEIR SEEMING PROSTITUTION IN SACRIFICING TO PRESENT POWER THE MOST SACRED PRINCIPLES
7912-105669-0008 AND HENCE THE RAPID PROGRESS DURING SOME TIME AND THE SUDDEN AS WELL AS ENTIRE CHECK SOON AFTER OF THE NEW DOCTRINES WHEN MEN WERE ONCE SETTLED IN THEIR PARTICULAR SECTS
7912-105669-0009 AND HAD FORTIFIED THEMSELVES IN AN HABITUAL DETESTATION OF THOSE WHO WERE DENOMINATED HERETICS THEY ADHERED WITH MORE OBSTINACY TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THEIR EDUCATION AND THE LIMITS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS THENCEFORTH REMAINED FIXED AND UNCHANGEABLE
7912-105669-0010 AND THE SUMMONS GIVEN EVERY ONE TO EXAMINE THE PRINCIPLES FORMERLY IMPOSED UPON HIM THOUGH THE MULTITUDE WERE TOTALLY UNQUALIFIED FOR THIS UNDERTAKING THEY YET WERE HIGHLY PLEASED WITH IT THEY FANCIED THAT THEY WERE EXERCISING THEIR JUDGMENT
7912-105669-0011 WHILE THEY OPPOSED TO THE PREJUDICES OF ANCIENT AUTHORITY MORE POWERFUL PREJUDICES OF ANOTHER KIND THE NOVELTY ITSELF OF THE DOCTRINES THE PLEASURE OF AN IMAGINARY TRIUMPH IN DISPUTE THE FERVENT ZEAL OF THE REFORMED PREACHERS
7912-105669-0012 THEIR PATIENCE AND EVEN ALACRITY IN SUFFERING PERSECUTION DEATH AND TORMENTS A DISGUST AT THE RESTRAINTS OF THE OLD RELIGION AN INDIGNATION AGAINST THE TYRANNY AND INTERESTED SPIRIT OF THE ECCLESIASTICS
7912-105669-0013 THESE MOTIVES WERE PREVALENT WITH THE PEOPLE AND BY SUCH CONSIDERATIONS WERE MEN SO GENERALLY INDUCED DURING THAT AGE TO THROW OFF THE RELIGION OF THEIR ANCESTORS
7912-105669-0014 BUT IN PROPORTION AS THE PRACTICE OF SUBMITTING RELIGION TO PRIVATE JUDGMENT WAS ACCEPTABLE TO THE PEOPLE
7912-105669-0015 THE VERY PRECEDENT OF SHAKING SO ANCIENT AND DEEP FOUNDED AN ESTABLISHMENT AS THAT OF THE ROMISH HIERARCHY MIGHT IT WAS APPREHENDED PREPARE THE WAY FOR OTHER INNOVATIONS THE REPUBLICAN SPIRIT WHICH NATURALLY TOOK PLACE AMONG THE REFORMERS
7912-105669-0016 INCREASED THIS JEALOUSY THE FURIOUS INSURRECTIONS OF THE POPULACE EXCITED BY MUNCER AND OTHER ANABAPTISTS IN GERMANY FURNISHED A NEW PRETENCE FOR DECRYING THE REFORMATION
7912-105669-0017 NOR OUGHT WE TO CONCLUDE BECAUSE PROTESTANTS IN OUR TIME PROVE AS DUTIFUL SUBJECTS AS THOSE OF ANY OTHER COMMUNION THAT THEREFORE SUCH APPREHENSIONS WERE ALTOGETHER WITHOUT ANY SHADOW OF PLAUSIBILITY
7912-105669-0018 AND BLINDED BY A NATURAL ARROGANCE AND OBSTINACY OF TEMPER HE HAD ENTERTAINED THE MOST LOFTY OPINION OF HIS OWN ERUDITION AND HE RECEIVED WITH IMPATIENCE MIXED WITH CONTEMPT ANY CONTRADICTION TO HIS SENTIMENTS
7912-105669-0019 LUTHER ALSO HAD BEEN SO IMPRUDENT AS TO TREAT IN A VERY INDECENT MANNER HIS ROYAL ANTAGONIST AND THOUGH HE AFTERWARDS MADE THE MOST HUMBLE SUBMISSIONS TO HENRY AND APOLOGIZED FOR THE VEHEMENCE OF HIS FORMER EXPRESSIONS
7912-105669-0020 HAD CORRECTED ONE CONSIDERABLE PART OF HIS EARLY PREJUDICES HE HAD MADE IT A POINT OF HONOR NEVER TO RELINQUISH THE REMAINDER SEPARATE AS HE STOOD FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND FROM THE ROMAN PONTIFF THE HEAD OF IT
7912-105669-0021 HENRY'S MINISTERS AND COURTIERS WERE OF AS MOTLEY A CHARACTER AS HIS CONDUCT AND SEEMED TO WAVER DURING THIS WHOLE REIGN BETWEEN THE ANCIENT AND THE NEW RELIGION THE QUEEN ENGAGED BY INTEREST AS WELL AS INCLINATION
7912-105669-0022 FAVORED THE CAUSE OF THE REFORMERS CROMWELL WHO WAS CREATED SECRETARY OF STATE AND WHO WAS DAILY ADVANCING IN THE KING'S CONFIDENCE HAD EMBRACED THE SAME VIEWS AND AS HE WAS A MAN OF PRUDENCE AND ABILITIES
7912-105669-0023 HE WAS ABLE VERY EFFECTUALLY THOUGH IN A COVERT MANNER TO PROMOTE THE LATE INNOVATIONS CRANMER
7912-105669-0024 VIRTUES WHICH HE POSSESSED IN AS EMINENT A DEGREE AS THOSE TIMES EQUALLY DISTRACTED WITH FACTION AND OPPRESSED BY TYRANNY COULD EASILY PERMIT ON THE OTHER HAND
7912-105669-0025 THE DUKE OF NORFOLK ADHERED TO THE ANCIENT FAITH AND BY HIS HIGH RANK AS WELL AS BY HIS TALENTS BOTH FOR PEACE AND WAR HE HAD GREAT AUTHORITY IN THE KING'S COUNCIL GARDINER LATELY CREATED BISHOP OF WINCHESTER
7912-105669-0026 HAD ENLISTED HIMSELF IN THE SAME PARTY AND THE SUPPLENESS OF HIS CHARACTER AND DEXTERITY OF HIS CONDUCT HAD RENDERED HIM EXTREMELY USEFUL TO IT
7912-105669-0027 ALL THESE MINISTERS WHILE THEY STOOD IN THE MOST IRRECONCILABLE OPPOSITION OF PRINCIPLES TO EACH OTHER WERE OBLIGED TO DISGUISE THEIR PARTICULAR OPINIONS AND TO PRETEND AN ENTIRE AGREEMENT WITH THE SENTIMENTS OF THEIR MASTER
7912-105669-0028 CROMWELL AND CRANMER STILL CARRIED THE APPEARANCE OF A CONFORMITY TO THE ANCIENT SPECULATIVE TENETS BUT THEY ARTFULLY MADE USE OF HENRY'S RESENTMENT TO WIDEN THE BREACH WITH THE SEE OF ROME
7912-105669-0029 NORFOLK AND GARDINER FEIGNED AN ASSENT TO THE KING'S SUPREMACY AND TO HIS RENUNCIATION OF THE SOVEREIGN PONTIFF BUT THEY ENCOURAGED HIS PASSION FOR THE CATHOLIC FAITH
7912-105669-0030 AND INSTIGATED HIM TO PUNISH THOSE DARING HERETICS WHO HAD PRESUMED TO REJECT HIS THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES BOTH SIDES HOPED BY THEIR UNLIMITED COMPLIANCE TO BRING HIM OVER TO THEIR PARTY
7912-105669-0031 THE KING MEANWHILE WHO HELD THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE FACTIONS WAS ENABLED BY THE COURTSHIP PAID HIM BOTH BY PROTESTANTS AND CATHOLICS TO ASSUME AN UNBOUNDED AUTHORITY AND THOUGH IN ALL HIS MEASURES HE WAS REALLY DRIVEN BY HIS UNGOVERNED HUMOR
7912-105669-0032 HE CASUALLY STEERED A COURSE WHICH LED MORE CERTAINLY TO ARBITRARY POWER THAN ANY WHICH THE MOST PROFOUND POLITICS COULD HAVE TRACED OUT TO HIM ARTIFICE REFINEMENT AND HYPOCRISY IN HIS SITUATION
7912-105669-0033 WOULD HAVE PUT BOTH PARTIES ON THEIR GUARD AGAINST HIM AND WOULD HAVE TAUGHT THEM RESERVE IN COMPLYING WITH A MONARCH WHOM THEY COULD NEVER HOPE THOROUGHLY TO HAVE GAINED BUT WHILE THE FRANKNESS SINCERITY AND OPENNESS OF HENRY'S TEMPER WERE GENERALLY KNOWN
7912-105669-0034 AS WELL AS THE DOMINION OF HIS FURIOUS PASSIONS EACH SIDE DREADED TO LOSE HIM BY THE SMALLEST OPPOSITION AND FLATTERED THEMSELVES THAT A BLIND COMPLIANCE WITH HIS WILL WOULD THROW HIM CORDIALLY AND FULLY INTO THEIR INTERESTS
7912-105669-0035 THE AMBIGUITY OF THE KING'S CONDUCT THOUGH IT KEPT THE COURTIERS IN AWE SERVED IN THE MAIN TO ENCOURAGE THE PROTESTANT DOCTRINE AMONG HIS SUBJECTS AND PROMOTED THAT SPIRIT OF INNOVATION
7912-105669-0036 WITH WHICH THE AGE WAS GENERALLY SEIZED AND WHICH NOTHING BUT AN ENTIRE UNIFORMITY AS WILL AS A STEADY SEVERITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION COULD BE ABLE TO REPRESS THERE WERE SOME ENGLISHMEN TINDAL JOYE
7912-105669-0037 CONSTANTINE AND OTHERS WHO DREADING THE EXERTION OF THE KING'S AUTHORITY HAD FLED TO ANTWERP WHERE THE GREAT PRIVILEGES POSSESSED BY THE LOW COUNTRY PROVINCES SERVED DURING SOME TIME TO GIVE THEM PROTECTION
7912-105669-0038 THESE MEN EMPLOYED THEMSELVES IN WRITING ENGLISH BOOKS AGAINST THE CORRUPTIONS OF THE CHURCH OF ROME AGAINST IMAGES RELICS PILGRIMAGES AND THEY EXCITED THE CURIOSITY OF MEN WITH REGARD TO THAT QUESTION THE MOST IMPORTANT IN THEOLOGY
7912-105669-0039 THE TERMS OF ACCEPTANCE WITH THE SUPREME BEING IN CONFORMITY TO THE LUTHERANS AND OTHER PROTESTANTS THEY ASSERTED THAT SALVATION WAS OBTAINED BY FAITH ALONE AND THAT THE MOST INFALLIBLE ROAD TO PERDITION WAS A RELIANCE ON GOOD WORKS
7912-105669-0040 BUT IT WAS A TRANSLATION OF THE SCRIPTURES BY TINDAL THAT WAS ESTEEMED THE MOST DANGEROUS TO THE ESTABLISHED FAITH THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS WORK COMPOSED WITH LITTLE ACCURACY WAS FOUND LIABLE TO CONSIDERABLE OBJECTIONS
7912-105669-0041 AND TINDAL WHO WAS POOR AND COULD NOT AFFORD TO LOSE A GREAT PART OF THE IMPRESSION WAS LONGING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF CORRECTING HIS ERRORS OF WHICH HE HAD BEEN MADE SENSIBLE TONSTAL THEN BISHOP OF LONDON
7912-105669-0042 SOON AFTER OF DURHAM A MAN OF GREAT MODERATION BEING DESIROUS TO DISCOURAGE IN THE GENTLEST MANNER THESE INNOVATIONS
7912-105669-0043 GAVE PRIVATE ORDERS FOR BUYING UP ALL THE COPIES THAT COULD BE FOUND AT ANTWERP AND HE BURNED THEM PUBLICLY IN CHEAPSIDE BY THIS MEASURE HE SUPPLIED TINDAL WITH MONEY ENABLED HIM TO PRINT A NEW AND CORRECT EDITION OF HIS WORK
7912-105669-0044 AND GAVE GREAT SCANDAL TO THE PEOPLE IN THUS COMMITTING TO THE FLAMES THE WORD OF GOD THE DISCIPLES OF THE REFORMATION MET WITH LITTLE SEVERITY DURING THE MINISTRY OF WOLSEY WHO THOUGH HIMSELF A CLERGYMAN
7912-105669-0045 IT WAS EVEN AN ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST HIM THAT BY HIS CONNIVANCE HE HAD ENCOURAGED THE GROWTH OF HERESY AND THAT HE HAD PROTECTED AND ACQUITTED SOME NOTORIOUS OFFENDERS SIR THOMAS MORE WHO SUCCEEDED WOLSEY AS CHANCELLOR
7912-105669-0046 IS AT ONCE AN OBJECT DESERVING OUR COMPASSION AND AN INSTANCE OF THE USUAL PROGRESS OF MEN'S SENTIMENTS DURING THAT AGE THIS MAN WHOSE ELEGANT GENIUS AND FAMILIAR ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE NOBLE SPIRIT OF ANTIQUITY
7912-105669-0047 HAD GIVEN HIM VERY ENLARGED SENTIMENTS AND WHO HAD IN HIS EARLY YEARS ADVANCED PRINCIPLES WHICH EVEN AT PRESENT
7912-105669-0048 AND THROWN INTO SUCH A SUPERSTITIOUS ATTACHMENT TO THE ANCIENT FAITH THAT FEW INQUISITORS HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF GREATER VIOLENCE IN THEIR PROSECUTION OF HERESY
7912-105669-0049 THOUGH ADORNED WITH THE GENTLEST MANNERS AS WELL AS THE PUREST INTEGRITY HE CARRIED TO THE UTMOST HEIGHT HIS AVERSION TO HETERODOXY AND JAMES BAINHAM IN PARTICULAR A GENTLEMAN OF THE TEMPLE
7912-105669-0050 AND HAVING REFUSED TO DISCOVER HIS ACCOMPLICES THE CHANCELLOR ORDERED HIM TO BE WHIPPED IN HIS PRESENCE AND AFTERWARDS SENT HIM TO THE TOWER WHERE HE HIMSELF SAW HIM PUT TO THE TORTURE
7912-105669-0051 HAD BEEN TERRIFIED INTO AN ABJURATION BUT WAS SO HAUNTED BY REMORSE THAT HIS FRIENDS DREADED SOME FATAL EFFECTS OF HIS DESPAIR
7912-105669-0052 AT LAST HIS MIND SEEMED TO BE MORE RELIEVED BUT THIS APPEARING CALM PROCEEDED ONLY FROM THE RESOLUTION WHICH HE HAD TAKEN OF EXPIATING HIS PAST OFFENCE BY AN OPEN CONFESSION OF THE TRUTH AND BY DYING A MARTYR TO IT
7912-105669-0053 HE WENT THROUGH NORFOLK TEACHING THE PEOPLE TO BEWARE OF IDOLATRY AND OF TRUSTING FOR THEIR SALVATION EITHER TO PILGRIMAGES OR TO THE COWL OF SAINT FRANCIS TO THE PRAYERS OF THE SAINTS OR TO IMAGES
7912-105669-0054 HE WAS SOON SEIZED TRIED IN THE BISHOP'S COURT AND CONDEMNED AS A RELAPSED HERETIC AND THE WRIT WAS SENT DOWN TO BURN HIM WHEN BROUGHT TO THE STAKE HE DISCOVERED SUCH PATIENCE FORTITUDE AND DEVOTION
7912-105669-0055 THOSE SEVERE EXECUTIONS WHICH IN ANOTHER DISPOSITION OF MEN'S MINDS WOULD HAVE SUFFICED TO SUPPRESS IT NOW SERVED ONLY TO DIFFUSE IT THE MORE AMONG THE PEOPLE
7912-105669-0056 AND TO INSPIRE THEM WITH HORROR AGAINST THE UNRELENTING PERSECUTORS BUT THOUGH HENRY NEGLECTED NOT TO PUNISH THE PROTESTANT DOCTRINE WHICH HE DEEMED HERESY HIS MOST FORMIDABLE ENEMIES HE KNEW
7912-105669-0057 WERE THE ZEALOUS ADHERENTS TO THE ANCIENT RELIGION CHIEFLY THE MONKS WHO HAVING THEIR IMMEDIATE DEPENDENCE ON THE ROMAN PONTIFF APPREHENDED THEIR OWN RUIN TO BE THE CERTAIN CONSEQUENCE OF ABOLISHING HIS AUTHORITY IN ENGLAND PEYTO
7912-105669-0058 A FRIAR PREACHING BEFORE THE KING HAD THE ASSURANCE TO TELL HIM THAT MANY LYING PROPHETS HAD DECEIVED HIM BUT HE AS A TRUE MICAJAH WARNED HIM THAT THE DOGS WOULD LICK HIS BLOOD
7912-105669-0059 A SLANDERER A DOG AND A TRAITOR ELSTON ANOTHER FRIAR OF THE SAME HOUSE INTERRUPTED THE PREACHER AND TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS ONE OF THE LYING PROPHETS WHO SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH BY ADULTERY THE SUCCESSION OF THE CROWN
7912-105669-0060 BUT THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD JUSTIFY ALL THAT PEYTO HAD SAID HENRY SILENCED THE PETULANT FRIAR BUT SHOWED NO OTHER MARK OF RESENTMENT THAN ORDERING PEYTO AND HIM TO BE SUMMONED BEFORE THE COUNCIL
7912-105669-0061 HAD BEEN SUBJECT TO HYSTERICAL FITS WHICH THREW HER BODY INTO UNUSUAL CONVULSIONS AND HAVING PRODUCED AN EQUAL DISORDER IN HER MIND MADE HER UTTER STRANGE SAYINGS WHICH AS SHE WAS SCARCELY CONSCIOUS OF THEM DURING THE TIME
7912-105669-0062 HAD SOON AFTER ENTIRELY ESCAPED HER MEMORY THE SILLY PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WERE STRUCK WITH THESE APPEARANCES WHICH THEY IMAGINED TO BE SUPERNATURAL AND RICHARD MASTERS
7912-105669-0063 VICAR OF THE PARISH A DESIGNING FELLOW FOUNDED ON THEM A PROJECT FROM WHICH HE HOPED TO ACQUIRE BOTH PROFIT AND CONSIDERATION HE WENT TO WARHAM ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY THEN ALIVE
7912-105669-0064 AND HAVING GIVEN HIM AN ACCOUNT OF ELIZABETH'S REVELATIONS HE SO FAR WROUGHT ON THAT PRUDENT BUT SUPERSTITIOUS PRELATE AS TO RECEIVE ORDERS FROM HIM TO WATCH HER IN HER TRANCES AND CAREFULLY TO NOTE DOWN ALL HER FUTURE SAYINGS
7912-105669-0065 THE REGARD PAID HER BY A PERSON OF SO HIGH A RANK SOON RENDERED HER STILL MORE THE OBJECT OF ATTENTION TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND IT WAS EASY FOR MASTERS TO PERSUADE THEM AS WELL AS THE MAID HERSELF
7912-105669-0066 THAT HER RAVINGS WERE INSPIRATIONS OF THE HOLY GHOST KNAVERY AS IS USUAL SOON AFTER SUCCEEDING TO DELUSION SHE LEARNED TO COUNTERFEIT TRANCES AND SHE THEN UTTERED IN AN EXTRAORDINARY TONE
7912-105669-0067 SUCH SPEECHES AS WERE DICTATED TO HER BY HER SPIRITUAL DIRECTOR
7912-105669-0068 WHICH STOOD IN A CHAPEL BELONGING TO MASTERS AND TO DRAW TO IT SUCH PILGRIMAGES AS USUALLY FREQUENTED THE MORE FAMOUS IMAGES AND RELICS
7912-105669-0069 IN PROSECUTION OF THIS DESIGN ELIZABETH PRETENDED REVELATIONS WHICH DIRECTED HER TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THAT IMAGE FOR A CURE
7912-105669-0070 AND BEING BROUGHT BEFORE IT IN THE PRESENCE OF A GREAT MULTITUDE SHE FELL ANEW INTO CONVULSIONS AND AFTER DISTORTING HER LIMBS AND COUNTENANCE DURING A COMPETENT TIME SHE AFFECTED TO HAVE OBTAINED A PERFECT RECOVERY BY THE INTERCESSION OF THE VIRGIN
7912-105669-0071 AND THE TWO PRIESTS FINDING THE IMPOSTURE TO SUCCEED BEYOND THEIR OWN EXPECTATIONS BEGAN TO EXTEND THEIR VIEWS AND TO LAY THE FOUNDATION OF MORE IMPORTANT ENTERPRISES
7912-105669-0072 THEY TAUGHT THEIR PENITENT TO DECLAIM AGAINST THE NEW DOCTRINES WHICH SHE DENOMINATED HERESY AGAINST INNOVATIONS IN ECCLESIASTICAL GOVERNMENT AND AGAINST THE KING'S INTENDED DIVORCE FROM CATHARINE
7912-105669-0073 SHE WENT SO FAR AS TO ASSERT THAT IF HE PROSECUTED THAT DESIGN AND MARRIED ANOTHER HE SHOULD NOT BE A KING A MONTH LONGER AND SHOULD NOT AN HOUR LONGER ENJOY THE FAVOR OF THE ALMIGHTY BUT SHOULD DIE THE DEATH OF A VILLAIN
7912-105669-0074 MANY MONKS THROUGHOUT ENGLAND EITHER FROM FOLLY OR ROGUERY OR FROM FACTION WHICH IS OFTEN A COMPLICATION OF BOTH
7912-105669-0075 WROTE A BOOK OF THE REVELATIONS AND PROPHECIES OF ELIZABETH MIRACLES WERE DAILY ADDED TO INCREASE THE WONDER AND THE PULPIT EVERY WHERE RESOUNDED WITH ACCOUNTS OF THE SANCTITY AND INSPIRATIONS OF THE NEW PROPHETESS
7912-105669-0076 MESSAGES WERE CARRIED FROM HER TO QUEEN CATHARINE BY WHICH THAT PRINCESS WAS EXHORTED TO PERSIST IN HER OPPOSITION TO THE DIVORCE THE POPE'S AMBASSADORS GAVE ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE POPULAR CREDULITY
