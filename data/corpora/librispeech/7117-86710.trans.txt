7117-86710-0000 CHAPTER SIX THE DEPUTY PROCUREUR DU ROI IN ONE OF THE ARISTOCRATIC MANSIONS BUILT BY PUGET IN THE RUE DU GRAND COURS OPPOSITE THE MEDUSA FOUNTAIN A SECOND MARRIAGE FEAST WAS BEING CELEBRATED ALMOST AT THE SAME HOUR
7117-86710-0001 IN THIS CASE HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE OCCASION OF THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS SIMILAR THE COMPANY WAS STRIKINGLY DISSIMILAR INSTEAD OF A RUDE MIXTURE OF SAILORS SOLDIERS AND THOSE BELONGING TO THE HUMBLEST GRADE OF LIFE
7117-86710-0002 THE PRESENT ASSEMBLY WAS COMPOSED OF THE VERY FLOWER OF MARSEILLES SOCIETY
7117-86710-0003 AND YOUNGER MEMBERS OF FAMILIES BROUGHT UP TO HATE AND EXECRATE THE MAN WHOM FIVE YEARS OF EXILE WOULD CONVERT INTO A MARTYR AND FIFTEEN OF RESTORATION ELEVATE TO THE RANK OF A GOD
7117-86710-0004 THE GUESTS WERE STILL AT TABLE AND THE HEATED AND ENERGETIC CONVERSATION THAT PREVAILED BETRAYED THE VIOLENT AND VINDICTIVE PASSIONS THAT THEN AGITATED EACH DWELLER OF THE SOUTH WHERE UNHAPPILY
7117-86710-0005 FOR FIVE CENTURIES RELIGIOUS STRIFE HAD LONG GIVEN INCREASED BITTERNESS TO THE VIOLENCE OF PARTY FEELING THE EMPEROR NOW KING OF THE PETTY ISLAND OF ELBA AFTER HAVING HELD SOVEREIGN SWAY OVER ONE HALF OF THE WORLD
7117-86710-0006 COUNTING AS HIS SUBJECTS A SMALL POPULATION OF FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND SOULS AFTER HAVING BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HEAR THE VIVE NAPOLEONS OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLIONS OF HUMAN BEINGS UTTERED IN TEN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES WAS LOOKED UPON HERE AS A RUINED MAN
7117-86710-0007 SEPARATED FOREVER FROM ANY FRESH CONNECTION WITH FRANCE OR CLAIM TO HER THRONE THE MAGISTRATES FREELY DISCUSSED THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS THE MILITARY PART OF THE COMPANY TALKED UNRESERVEDLY OF MOSCOW AND LEIPSIC
7117-86710-0008 AND THE LADIES SNATCHING THEIR BOUQUETS FROM THEIR FAIR BOSOMS STREWED THE TABLE WITH THEIR FLORAL TREASURES IN A WORD AN ALMOST POETICAL FERVOR PREVAILED AH SAID THE MARQUISE DE SAINT MERAN
7117-86710-0009 AH THESE REVOLUTIONISTS WHO HAVE DRIVEN US FROM THOSE VERY POSSESSIONS THEY AFTERWARDS PURCHASED FOR A MERE TRIFLE DURING THE REIGN OF TERROR WOULD BE COMPELLED TO OWN WERE THEY HERE THAT ALL TRUE DEVOTION WAS ON OUR SIDE
7117-86710-0010 AND STATION WAS TRULY OUR LOUIS THE WELL BELOVED
7117-86710-0011 AM I NOT RIGHT VILLEFORT I BEG YOUR PARDON MADAME I REALLY MUST PRAY YOU TO EXCUSE ME BUT IN TRUTH I WAS NOT ATTENDING TO THE CONVERSATION MARQUISE MARQUISE INTERPOSED THE OLD NOBLEMAN WHO HAD PROPOSED THE TOAST
7117-86710-0012 LET THE YOUNG PEOPLE ALONE LET ME TELL YOU ON ONE'S WEDDING DAY THERE ARE MORE AGREEABLE SUBJECTS OF CONVERSATION THAN DRY POLITICS NEVER MIND DEAREST MOTHER SAID A YOUNG AND LOVELY GIRL WITH A PROFUSION OF LIGHT BROWN HAIR
7117-86710-0013 AND EYES THAT SEEMED TO FLOAT IN LIQUID CRYSTAL
7117-86710-0014 HE IS YOUR OWN FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIKE
7117-86710-0015 IF THE MARQUISE WILL DEIGN TO REPEAT THE WORDS I BUT IMPERFECTLY CAUGHT
7117-86710-0016 THERE IS ALWAYS ONE BRIGHT SMILING SPOT IN THE DESERT OF HER HEART AND THAT IS THE SHRINE OF MATERNAL LOVE I FORGIVE YOU
7117-86710-0017 THEY HAD HOWEVER WHAT SUPPLIED THE PLACE OF THOSE FINE QUALITIES
7117-86710-0018 AND THAT WAS FANATICISM NAPOLEON IS THE MAHOMET OF THE WEST AND IS WORSHIPPED BY HIS COMMONPLACE BUT AMBITIONS FOLLOWERS NOT ONLY AS A LEADER AND LAWGIVER BUT ALSO AS THE PERSONIFICATION OF EQUALITY HE CRIED THE MARQUISE
7117-86710-0019 NAY MADAME I WOULD PLACE EACH OF THESE HEROES ON HIS RIGHT PEDESTAL
7117-86710-0020 THAT OF NAPOLEON ON THE COLUMN OF THE PLACE VENDOME THE ONLY DIFFERENCE CONSISTS IN THE OPPOSITE CHARACTER OF THE EQUALITY ADVOCATED BY THESE TWO MEN ONE IS THE EQUALITY THAT ELEVATES THE OTHER IS THE EQUALITY THAT DEGRADES
7117-86710-0021 I DO NOT MEAN TO DENY THAT BOTH THESE MEN WERE REVOLUTIONARY SCOUNDRELS AND THAT THE NINTH THERMIDOR AND THE FOURTH OF APRIL IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN WERE LUCKY DAYS FOR FRANCE WORTHY OF BEING GRATEFULLY REMEMBERED BY EVERY FRIEND TO MONARCHY AND CIVIL ORDER
7117-86710-0022 AND THAT EXPLAINS HOW IT COMES TO PASS THAT FALLEN AS I TRUST HE IS FOREVER NAPOLEON HAS STILL RETAINED A TRAIN OF PARASITICAL SATELLITES
7117-86710-0023 CROMWELL FOR INSTANCE WHO WAS NOT HALF SO BAD AS NAPOLEON HAD HIS PARTISANS AND ADVOCATES
7117-86710-0024 BUT BEAR IN MIND IF YOU PLEASE THAT OUR RESPECTIVE PARENTS UNDERWENT PERSECUTION AND PROSCRIPTION FROM DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE PRINCIPLES IN PROOF OF WHICH I MAY REMARK THAT WHILE MY FAMILY REMAINED AMONG THE STANCHEST ADHERENTS OF THE EXILED PRINCES
7117-86710-0025 YOUR FATHER LOST NO TIME IN JOINING THE NEW GOVERNMENT AND THAT WHILE THE CITIZEN NOIRTIER WAS A GIRONDIN THE COUNT NOIRTIER BECAME A SENATOR DEAR MOTHER INTERPOSED RENEE
7117-86710-0026 YOU KNOW VERY WELL IT WAS AGREED THAT ALL THESE DISAGREEABLE REMINISCENCES SHOULD FOREVER BE LAID ASIDE
7117-86710-0027 WHAT AVAILS RECRIMINATION OVER MATTERS WHOLLY PAST RECALL FOR MY OWN PART I HAVE LAID ASIDE EVEN THE NAME OF MY FATHER AND ALTOGETHER DISOWN HIS POLITICAL PRINCIPLES HE WAS NAY PROBABLY MAY STILL BE A BONAPARTIST AND IS CALLED NOIRTIER
7117-86710-0028 AND CONDESCEND ONLY TO REGARD THE YOUNG SHOOT WHICH HAS STARTED UP AT A DISTANCE FROM THE PARENT TREE WITHOUT HAVING THE POWER ANY MORE THAN THE WISH TO SEPARATE ENTIRELY FROM THE STOCK FROM WHICH IT SPRUNG
7117-86710-0029 EXCELLENTLY WELL SAID COME NOW I HAVE HOPES OF OBTAINING WHAT I HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS ENDEAVORING TO PERSUADE THE MARQUISE TO PROMISE NAMELY A PERFECT AMNESTY AND FORGETFULNESS OF THE PAST WITH ALL MY HEART REPLIED THE MARQUISE
7117-86710-0030 AND THAT AT OUR RECOMMENDATION THE KING CONSENTED TO FORGET THE PAST AS I DO AND HERE SHE EXTENDED TO HIM HER HAND AS I NOW DO AT YOUR ENTREATY BUT BEAR IN MIND THAT SHOULD THERE FALL IN YOUR WAY ANY ONE GUILTY OF CONSPIRING AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT
7117-86710-0031 AS IT IS KNOWN YOU BELONG TO A SUSPECTED FAMILY
7117-86710-0032 MY PROFESSION AS WELL AS THE TIMES IN WHICH WE LIVE COMPELS ME TO BE SEVERE I HAVE ALREADY SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCTED SEVERAL PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS AND BROUGHT THE OFFENDERS TO MERITED PUNISHMENT BUT WE HAVE NOT DONE WITH THE THING YET
7117-86710-0033 DO YOU INDEED THINK SO INQUIRED THE MARQUISE I AM AT LEAST FEARFUL OF IT NAPOLEON IN THE ISLAND OF ELBA IS TOO NEAR FRANCE AND HIS PROXIMITY KEEPS UP THE HOPES OF HIS PARTISANS
7117-86710-0034 WHO ARE DAILY UNDER ONE FRIVOLOUS PRETEXT OR OTHER GETTING UP QUARRELS WITH THE ROYALISTS FROM HENCE ARISE CONTINUAL AND FATAL DUELS AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES OF PERSONS AND ASSASSINATIONS IN THE LOWER
7117-86710-0035 AND WHERE IS IT DECIDED TO TRANSFER HIM TO SAINT HELENA FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE WHERE IS THAT ASKED THE MARQUISE AN ISLAND SITUATED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EQUATOR AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND LEAGUES FROM HERE REPLIED THE COUNT
7117-86710-0036 WELL SAID THE MARQUISE IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT BY THE AID OF THE HOLY ALLIANCE WE SHALL BE RID OF NAPOLEON
7117-86710-0037 THE KING IS EITHER A KING OR NO KING IF HE BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS SOVEREIGN OF FRANCE HE SHOULD BE UPHELD IN PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY AND THIS CAN BEST BE EFFECTED BY EMPLOYING THE MOST INFLEXIBLE AGENTS TO PUT DOWN EVERY ATTEMPT AT CONSPIRACY
7117-86710-0038 UNFORTUNATELY MADAME
7117-86710-0039 THE STRONG ARM OF THE LAW IS NOT CALLED UPON TO INTERFERE UNTIL THE EVIL HAS TAKEN PLACE THEN ALL HE HAS GOT TO DO IS TO ENDEAVOR TO REPAIR IT NAY MADAME THE LAW IS FREQUENTLY POWERLESS TO EFFECT THIS ALL IT CAN DO IS TO AVENGE THE WRONG DONE
7117-86710-0040 AND THE CHERISHED FRIEND OF MADEMOISELLE DE SAINT MERAN DO TRY AND GET UP SOME FAMOUS TRIAL WHILE WE ARE AT MARSEILLES I NEVER WAS IN A LAW COURT I AM TOLD IT IS SO VERY AMUSING AMUSING CERTAINLY REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN
7117-86710-0041 INASMUCH AS INSTEAD OF SHEDDING TEARS AS AT THE FICTITIOUS TALE OF WOE PRODUCED AT A THEATRE YOU BEHOLD IN A LAW COURT A CASE OF REAL AND GENUINE DISTRESS A DRAMA OF LIFE THE PRISONER WHOM YOU THERE SEE PALE AGITATED AND ALARMED
7117-86710-0042 INSTEAD OF AS IS THE CASE WHEN A CURTAIN FALLS ON A TRAGEDY GOING HOME TO SUP PEACEFULLY WITH HIS FAMILY AND THEN RETIRING TO REST THAT HE MAY RECOMMENCE HIS MIMIC WOES ON THE MORROW IS REMOVED FROM YOUR SIGHT MERELY TO BE RECONDUCTED TO HIS PRISON
7117-86710-0043 AND DELIVERED UP TO THE EXECUTIONER I LEAVE YOU TO JUDGE HOW FAR YOUR NERVES ARE CALCULATED TO BEAR YOU THROUGH SUCH A SCENE OF THIS HOWEVER BE ASSURED THAT SHOULD ANY FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT ITSELF I WILL NOT FAIL TO OFFER YOU THE CHOICE OF BEING PRESENT
7117-86710-0044 DON'T YOU SEE HOW YOU ARE FRIGHTENING US AND YET YOU LAUGH WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE TIS LIKE A DUEL I HAVE ALREADY RECORDED SENTENCE OF DEATH FIVE OR SIX TIMES AGAINST THE MOVERS OF POLITICAL CONSPIRACIES
7117-86710-0045 AND WHO CAN SAY HOW MANY DAGGERS MAY BE READY SHARPENED AND ONLY WAITING A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY TO BE BURIED IN MY HEART
7117-86710-0046 YOU SURELY ARE NOT IN EARNEST INDEED I AM REPLIED THE YOUNG MAGISTRATE WITH A SMILE
7117-86710-0047 SUPPOSE FOR INSTANCE THE PRISONER AS IS MORE THAN PROBABLE TO HAVE SERVED UNDER NAPOLEON WELL CAN YOU EXPECT FOR AN INSTANT
7117-86710-0048 WILL SCRUPLE MORE TO DRIVE A STILETTO INTO THE HEART OF ONE HE KNOWS TO BE HIS PERSONAL ENEMY THAN TO SLAUGHTER HIS FELLOW CREATURES
7117-86710-0049 BESIDES ONE REQUIRES THE EXCITEMENT OF BEING HATEFUL IN THE EYES OF THE ACCUSED IN ORDER TO LASH ONE'S SELF INTO A STATE OF SUFFICIENT VEHEMENCE AND POWER I WOULD NOT CHOOSE TO SEE THE MAN AGAINST WHOM I PLEADED SMILE AS THOUGH IN MOCKERY OF MY WORDS
7117-86710-0050 JUST THE PERSON WE REQUIRE AT A TIME LIKE THE PRESENT SAID A SECOND
7117-86710-0051 I MEAN THE TRIAL OF THE MAN FOR MURDERING HIS FATHER UPON MY WORD YOU KILLED HIM ERE THE EXECUTIONER HAD LAID HIS HAND UPON HIM OH AS FOR PARRICIDES AND SUCH DREADFUL PEOPLE AS THAT INTERPOSED RENEE IT MATTERS VERY LITTLE WHAT IS DONE TO THEM
7117-86710-0052 BUT AS REGARDS POOR UNFORTUNATE CREATURES WHOSE ONLY CRIME CONSISTS IN HAVING MIXED THEMSELVES UP IN POLITICAL INTRIGUES WHY THAT IS THE VERY WORST OFFENCE THEY COULD POSSIBLY COMMIT FOR DON'T YOU SEE RENEE THE KING IS THE FATHER OF HIS PEOPLE
7117-86710-0053 AND HE WHO SHALL PLOT OR CONTRIVE AUGHT AGAINST THE LIFE AND SAFETY OF THE PARENT OF THIRTY TWO MILLIONS OF SOULS IS A PARRICIDE UPON A FEARFULLY GREAT SCALE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT REPLIED RENEE

7117-86710-0055 NOWADAYS THE MILITARY PROFESSION IS IN ABEYANCE AND THE MAGISTERIAL ROBE IS THE BADGE OF HONOR THERE IS A WISE LATIN PROVERB THAT IS VERY MUCH IN POINT CEDANT ARMA TOGAE

7117-86710-0058 AND ONE WHICH WILL GO FAR TO EFFACE THE RECOLLECTION OF HIS FATHER'S CONDUCT ADDED THE INCORRIGIBLE MARQUISE
7117-86710-0059 FOR HE HAS TO ATONE FOR PAST DERELICTION WHILE I HAVE NO OTHER IMPULSE THAN WARM DECIDED PREFERENCE AND CONVICTION HAVING MADE THIS WELL TURNED SPEECH
7117-86710-0060 CRIED THE COMTE DE SALVIEUX THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I MYSELF SAID THE OTHER DAY AT THE TUILERIES WHEN QUESTIONED BY HIS MAJESTY'S PRINCIPAL CHAMBERLAIN TOUCHING THE SINGULARITY OF AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE SON OF A GIRONDIN
7117-86710-0061 AND I ASSURE YOU HE SEEMED FULLY TO COMPREHEND THAT THIS MODE OF RECONCILING POLITICAL DIFFERENCES WAS BASED UPON SOUND AND EXCELLENT PRINCIPLES THEN THE KING WHO WITHOUT OUR SUSPECTING IT HAD OVERHEARD OUR CONVERSATION
7117-86710-0062 OBSERVE THAT THE KING DID NOT PRONOUNCE THE WORD NOIRTIER
7117-86710-0063 WHO WILL BE SURE TO MAKE A FIGURE IN HIS PROFESSION I LIKE HIM MUCH AND IT GAVE ME GREAT PLEASURE TO HEAR THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO BECOME THE SON IN LAW OF THE MARQUIS AND MARQUISE DE SAINT MERAN I SHOULD MYSELF HAVE RECOMMENDED THE MATCH
7117-86710-0064 HAD NOT THE NOBLE MARQUIS ANTICIPATED MY WISHES BY REQUESTING MY CONSENT TO IT
7117-86710-0065 I GIVE YOU HIS VERY WORDS AND IF THE MARQUIS CHOOSES TO BE CANDID HE WILL CONFESS THAT THEY PERFECTLY AGREE WITH WHAT HIS MAJESTY SAID TO HIM WHEN HE WENT SIX MONTHS AGO TO CONSULT HIM UPON THE SUBJECT OF YOUR ESPOUSING HIS DAUGHTER THAT IS TRUE

7117-86710-0069 IF YOU WISH TO SEE ME THE KING'S ATTORNEY YOU MUST DESIRE FOR ME SOME OF THOSE VIOLENT AND DANGEROUS DISEASES FROM THE CURE OF WHICH SO MUCH HONOR REDOUNDS TO THE PHYSICIAN AT THIS MOMENT
7117-86710-0070 A SERVANT ENTERED THE ROOM AND WHISPERED A FEW WORDS IN HIS EAR
7117-86710-0071 HE SOON HOWEVER RETURNED HIS WHOLE FACE BEAMING WITH DELIGHT RENEE REGARDED HIM WITH FOND AFFECTION AND CERTAINLY HIS HANDSOME FEATURES LIT UP AS THEY THEN WERE WITH MORE THAN USUAL FIRE AND ANIMATION

7117-86710-0073 BURST SIMULTANEOUSLY FROM ALL WHO WERE NEAR ENOUGH TO THE MAGISTRATE TO HEAR HIS WORDS WHY IF MY INFORMATION PROVE CORRECT A SORT OF BONAPARTE CONSPIRACY HAS JUST BEEN DISCOVERED CAN I BELIEVE MY EARS CRIED THE MARQUISE
