7062-96512-0000 MISTER VAN EMMON AND I STATED BILLIE COOLLY AS THEY PUT ON THEIR BRACELETS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DECIDE UPON THE BEST WAY OF TELLING THEM HOW TO OBTAIN FIRE NEITHER SMITH NOR THE DOCTOR SHOWED THAT HE NOTICED HER MISTER VAN EMMON
7062-96512-0001 EVIDENTLY THE TWO WERE STILL UNRECONCILED I ARGUE REMARKED THE GEOLOGIST THAT THE SIMPLEST METHOD WILL BE A CHEMICAL ONE THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS TO PRODUCE FIRE SPONTANEOUSLY WITH CHEMICALS AND THIS WOMAN ROLLA COULD DO IT EASILY
7062-96512-0002 BILLIE INDULGED IN A SMALL SUPERIOR SMILE HE FORGETS THAT ALL THESE CHEMICAL METHODS REQUIRE PURE CHEMICALS
7062-96512-0003 WHAT'S YOUR PROPOSITION THEN FROM THE DOCTOR OPTICS ENTHUSIASTICALLY
7062-96512-0004 HE'S SOMETHING OF A MINERALOGIST HOW TO GRIND AND POLISH A PIECE OF CRYSTAL INTO THIS SHAPE VAN EMMON GROANED MARVELOUS
7062-96512-0005 MISSUS VAN EMMON SMITH ALSO SHOOK HIS HEAD NEITHER OF YOU HAS THE RIGHT IDEA THE EASIEST WAY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE AN ELECTRICAL ONE HE PAUSED FROWNING HARD THEN VETOED HIS OWN PLAN
7062-96512-0006 THUNDER I'M ALWAYS SPEAKING FIRST AND THINKING AFTERWARD I NEVER USED TO DO IT ACCUSINGLY UNTIL I GOT IN WITH YOU FOLKS ANYHOW ELECTRICITY WON'T DO YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE PRACTICALLY PURE ELEMENTS FOR THAT TOO
7062-96512-0007 GUESS IT'S UP TO YOU DOC SAID BILLIE AND THEY ALL LOOKED RESPECTFULLY TOWARD THEIR HOST HE LAUGHED YOU THREE WILL NEVER LEARN ANYTHING YOU'LL CONTINUE TO THINK THAT I'M A REGULAR WONDER ABOUT THESE THINGS
7062-96512-0008 ALL I HAVE TO DO IS SELECT THE ONE IDEA REMAINING AFTER YOU'VE DISPROVED THE REST NOTHING TO IT HE PAUSED I'M AFRAID WE'RE REDUCED TO THE SPARK METHOD IT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG TO PROCURE MATERIALS PURE ENOUGH FOR ANY OTHER PLAN
7062-96512-0009 FRICTION IS OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR SUCH PEOPLE THEY HAVEN'T THE PATIENCE SUPPOSE WE GO AHEAD ON THE FLINT AND SPARK BASIS THEY WENT AT ONCE INTO THE FAMILIAR TRANCE STATE NIGHTFALL WAS APPROACHING ON THE PART OF SANUS IN WHICH THEY WERE INTERESTED
7062-96512-0010 SMITH AND VAN EMMON CAME UPON DULNOP AND CORRUS AS THEY WERE TALKING TOGETHER THE HERDSMAN WAS SAYING LAD MY HEART IS HEAVY THIS NIGHT MUCH OF HIS USUAL VIGOR WAS ABSENT WHEN I WERE PASSING CUNORA'S FIELD THIS DAY
7062-96512-0011 SOME OF THE MASTERS CAME AND DROVE ME OVER TO HER SIDE I TRIED TO GET AWAY AND ONE THREATENED TO KILL I FEAR ME LAD THEY INTEND TO FORCE US TO MARRY WHAT FIERCELY FROM THE YOUNGER CORRUS LAID A HAND UPON HIS ARM NAY DULNOP
7062-96512-0012 FEAR NOT I HAVE NO FEELING FOR THY CUNORA I MAY MARRY HER BUT AS FOR FATHERING HER CHILDREN NO SUPPOSE THROUGH SET TEETH SUPPOSE THEY SHOULD THREATEN TO KILL THEE I SHOULD RATHER DIE DULNOP THAN BE UNTRUE TO ROLLA
7062-96512-0013 AND I TELL THEE NEITHER SHALL I HAVE AUGHT TO DO WITH ROLLA RATHER DEATH THAN DISHONOR NEXT MOMENT SILENCE FELL BETWEEN THEM
7062-96512-0014 FOR SITTING APART IN THE GROWING DARKNESS EACH WAS PLAINLY IN TERROR OF THE MORROW
7062-96512-0015 I HE PAUSED ABASHED
7062-96512-0016 I FEAR I AM AFRAID I MIGHT GIVE IN AT THIS DULNOP BROKE DOWN AND FELL TO SOBBING NOTHING COULD HAVE TOLD THE INVESTIGATORS SO WELL JUST HOW CHILDLIKE THE SANUSIANS REALLY WERE CORRUS HAD ALL HE COULD DO TO HOLD IN HIMSELF
7062-96512-0017 MOWNOTH HE EXCLAIMED HIS EYES RAISED FERVENTLY IF IT BE THY WILL TO DELIVER US GIVE US THE SECRET THIS NIGHT MEANWHILE IN ROLLA'S HUT A SIMILAR SCENE WAS GOING ON UNDER THE DOCTOR'S PROJECTED EYE
7062-96512-0018 CUNORA LOST HER NERVE AND ROLLA CAME NEAR TO DOING THE SAME IN HER EFFORTS TO COMFORT THE OTHER THEY ARE HEARTLESS THINGS ROLLA EXCLAIMED WITH SUCH BITTERNESS AS HER NATURE WOULD PERMIT THEY KNOW NOT WHAT LOVE IS
7062-96512-0019 THEY WITH THEIR DRONES AND THEIR EGG BABES WHAT IS FAMILY LIFE TO THEM NOTHING SOMEHOW I FEEL THAT THEIR REIGN IS NEARLY AT AN END CUNORA PERHAPS THE GREAT SECRET SHALL BE GIVEN US TO NIGHT
7062-96512-0020 WHY SAY YE THAT ROLLA BECAUSE THE TIME BE RIPE FOR IT ARE NOT ALL OUR KIND LOOKING FORWARD TO IT ARE WE NOT ALL EXPECTING AND LONGING FOR IT KNOW WE NOT THAT WE SHALL MUST HAVE WHAT WE ALL SO EARNESTLY DESIRE
7062-96512-0021 IT WAS STRIKING TO HEAR THIS BIT OF MODERN PSYCHOLOGY UTTERED BY THIS PRIMITIVE WOMAN LET ME HEAR NO MORE OF THY WEEPING YE SHALL NOT BE MADE TO WED CORRUS NEVERTHELESS AT THE SPEAKING OF HER LOVER'S NAME
7062-96512-0022 THE OLDER WOMAN'S LIPS TREMBLED DESPITE THEMSELVES AND SHE SAID NOTHING FURTHER BEYOND A BRIEF SLEEP WELL AFTER WHICH THE TWO WOMEN TURNED IN AND SHORTLY REACHED THE DROWSY POINT THUS IT HAPPENED THAT ROLLA AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO
7062-96512-0023 ONCE MORE AROUSED CUNORA IN GREAT EXCITEMENT
7062-96512-0024 PROCEEDED TO RELATE WHAT SHE HAD SEEN SHE FINISHED THE SEED OF THE FLOWER CAN BE GROWN IN THE HEART OF ROTTING WOOD AND FOR HOURS AFTERWARD THE TWO WHISPERED EXCITEDLY IN THE DARKNESS IT WAS HARD TO HAVE TO WAIT TILL DAWN
7062-96512-0025 AS FOR CORRUS AND DULNOP THEY EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO SEARCH THE HEAPS OF STONE IN THE MINERAL YARDS ALTHOUGH NEITHER REALLY EXPECTED TO FIND WHAT THEY SOUGHT BUT THE FOUR ON THE EARTH NOT BEING ABLE TO DO ANYTHING FURTHER UNTIL MORNING
7062-96512-0026 PROCEEDED TO MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME IN THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE SMITH AND THE DOCTOR SLEPT TOGETHER LIKEWISE BILLIE AND MISSUS KINNEY VAN EMMON OCCUPIED THE GUEST ROOM IN LONELY GRANDEUR
7062-96512-0027 AGAIN IN THE TRANCE STATE THE FOUR FOUND THAT ROLLA AND CUNORA AFTER REACHING AN UNDERSTANDING WITH CORRUS AND DULNOP
7062-96512-0028 FIVE BEES ACCOMPANIED THEM WITHIN A FEW MINUTES HOWEVER
7062-96512-0029 AND SHORTLY THE GUARDS WERE WITHDRAWN THIS MEANT THAT THE HOLIDAY WAS OFFICIALLY SANCTIONED SO LONG AS THE TWO COUPLES KEPT APART BUT IF THEY WERE TO JOIN FORCES AFTERWARD AND BE CAUGHT IN THE ACT THEY WOULD BE SEVERELY PUNISHED SUCH WAS BEE EFFICIENCY
7062-96512-0030 AND SENTIMENT THE DOCTOR HAD IMPRESSED ROLLA WITH THE FACT THAT SHE WOULD FIND THE DESIRED STONE IN A MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY CUNORA HOWEVER WAS FOR EXAMINING EVERY ROCK SHE CAME TO
7062-96512-0031 ROLLA WAS CONTINUALLY PASSING JUDGMENT UPON SOME SPECIMEN NAY SAID SHE FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME TIS A VERY BRIGHT STONE WE SEEK VERY SMALL AND VERY SHINY LIKE SUNLIGHT ON THE WATER I SHALL KNOW IT WHEN I SEE IT
7062-96512-0032 AND I SHALL SEE IT NOT UNTIL WE REACH THE MOUNTAINS SOON CUNORA'S IMPATIENCE WORE OFF AND THE TWO CONCENTRATED UPON MAKING TIME BY MIDDAY THEY WERE WELL INTO THE HILLS FOLLOWING THE COURSE OF A VERY DRY CREEK
7062-96512-0033 AND NOW THEY KEPT A SHARP LOOKOUT AT EVERY STEP VAN EMMON AND SMITH HAD SIMILARLY IMPRESSED CORRUS AND DULNOP WITH THE RESULT THAT THERE WAS NO LOSS OF TIME IN THE BEGINNING
7062-96512-0034 THE TWO MEN REACHED THE HILLS ON THEIR SIDE OF THE VALLEY AN HOUR BEFORE THE WOMEN REACHED THEIRS AND THUS THE SEARCH BEGAN THE STRANGEST SEARCH BEYOND A DOUBT WITHIN THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE
7062-96512-0035 IT WAS NOT LIKE THE WORK OF SOME OF EARTH'S PREHISTORIC MEN WHO ALREADY KNEW FIRE AND WERE MERELY LOOKING UP FRESH MATERIALS IT WAS A QUEST IN WHICH AN IDEA AN IDEA GIVEN IN A VISION WAS THE SOLE DRIVING FORCE
7062-96512-0036 THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF THE MATTER WAS THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE MENTALLY INCAPABLE OF CONCEIVING THAT THERE WAS INTELLIGENCE AT WORK UPON THEM FROM ANOTHER WORLD OR EVEN THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER WORLD YE SAW THE STARS LAST NIGHT CORRUS SPOKE TO DULNOP WELL
7062-96512-0037 JUST SUCH STARS AS SHALL AWAKEN THE SEED OF THE FLOWER YE SHALL SEE BOTH KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO LOOK FOR THE BRASSY REGULARLY CUT CRYSTALS WITH THE BLACK STRIPINGS SUCH AS HAS LED COUNTLESS MEN TO GO THROUGH UNTOLD HARDSHIPS IN THE BELIEF THAT THEY HAD FOUND GOLD
7062-96512-0038 IN FACT IRON PYRITES IS OFTEN CALLED FOOL GOLD SO DECEPTIVE IS ITS GLITTER YET IT WAS JUST THE THING FOR THE PURPOSE FLINT THEY ALREADY HAD LARGE QUANTITIES OF IT PRACTICALLY ALL THEIR TOOLS SUCH AS AXES AND KNIVES WERE MADE OF IT
7062-96512-0039 STRUCK AGAINST IRON PYRITES A LARGER FATTER HOTTER SPARK COULD BE OBTAINED THAN WITH ANY OTHER NATURAL COMBINATION IT WAS DULNOP'S LUCK TO SEE THE OUTCROPPING
7062-96512-0040 HE FOUND THE MINERAL EXPOSED TO PLAIN VIEW A FEW FEET ABOVE THE BOTTOM OF THE RAVINE THE TWO WERE ASCENDING WITH A SHOUT OF TRIUMPH HE LEAPED UPON THE ROCK HERE CORRUS HE YELLED DANCING LIKE MAD HERE IS THE GIFT OF THE GODS
7062-96512-0041 THE OLDER MAN DIDN'T ATTEMPT TO HIDE HIS DELIGHT HE GRABBED HIS COMPANION AND HUGGED HIM UNTIL HIS RIBS BEGAN TO CRACK THEN WITH A SINGLE BLOW FROM HIS HUGE CLUB THE HERDSMAN KNOCKED THE SPECIMEN CLEAR OF THE SLATE IN WHICH IT WAS SET
7062-96512-0042 SUCH WAS THEIR EXCITEMENT NEITHER DREAMED OF MARKING THE PLACE IN ANY WAY FIRST SATISFYING THEMSELVES THAT THE PYRITES REALLY COULD PRODUCE STARS FROM THE FLINT THE TWO HURRIED DOWN STREAM IN SEARCH OF THE RIGHT KIND OF WOOD
7062-96512-0043 IN HALF AN HOUR CORRUS CAME ACROSS A DEAD WORM EATEN TREE FROM WHICH HE NONCHALANTLY BROKE OFF A LIMB AS BIG AS HIS LEG THE INTERIOR WAS FILLED WITH A DRY STRINGY ROT JUST THE RIGHT THING FOR MAKING A SPARK LIVE THEN CAME A REAL DIFFICULTY
7062-96512-0044 IT WILL BE BETTER APPRECIATED WHEN THE MEN'S CHILDISH NATURE IS BORNE IN MIND THEIR PATIENCE WAS TERRIBLY STRAINED IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO MAKE THE SPARKS FLY INTO THE TINDER AGAIN AND AGAIN ONE OF THEM WOULD THROW THE ROCKS ANGRILY TO THE GROUND
7062-96512-0045 FAIRLY SNARLING WITH EXASPERATION HOWEVER THE OTHER WOULD IMMEDIATELY TAKE THEM UP AND TRY AGAIN NEITHER MAN HAD A TENTH THE DEFTNESS THAT IS COMMON TO ADULTS ON THE EARTH IN SIZE AND STRENGTH ALONE THEY WERE MEN
7062-96512-0046 THEY WERE MERE CHILDREN ALL TOLD IT WAS OVER TWO HOURS BEFORE THE PUNK BEGAN TO SMOLDER BY MOWNOTH SWORE THE HERDSMAN STARING REVERENTLY AT THE SMOKE WE HAVE DONE A MIRACLE DULNOP YE AND I
7062-96512-0047 BE YE SURE THIS IS NO DREAM QUITE IN HUMAN FASHION DULNOP SERIOUSLY REACHED OUT AND PINCHED THE HERDSMAN'S TREMENDOUS ARM CORRUS WINCED BUT WAS TOO WELL PLEASED WITH THE RESULT TO TAKE REVENGE
7062-96512-0048 IT BE NO DREAM HE DECLARED STILL AWESTRUCK NAY AGREED DULNOP AND NOW TO MAKE THE FLOWER GROW IT WAS CORRUS'S LUNGS WHICH REALLY DID THE WORK
7062-96512-0049 HIS PRODIGIOUS CHEST WAS BETTER THAN A SMALL PAIR OF BELLOWS AND HE BLEW JUST AS HE HAD BEEN TOLD IN THE VISION PRESENTLY A SMALL FLAME APPEARED IN THE TINDER AND LEAPED EAGERLY UPWARD
7062-96512-0050 BOTH MEN JUMPED BACK AND FOR LACK OF ENOUGH AIR THE FLAME WENT OUT NEVER MIND EXCLAIMED DULNOP AT CORRUS'S CRESTFALLEN LOOK I REMEMBER THAT WE MUST BE READY WITH LEAVES AND THE LIKE AS SOON AS THE BLOSSOM APPEARS
7062-96512-0051 BLOW YE GREAT WIND MAKER AND I SHALL FEED THE FLOWER AND THUS IT CAME ABOUT THAT TWO MEN OF SANUS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE PLANET LOOKED UPON FIRE ITSELF AND WHEN THEY HAD GOT IT TO BURNING WELL EACH OF THEM STARED AT HIS HANDS
