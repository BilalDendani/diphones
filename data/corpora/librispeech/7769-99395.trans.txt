7769-99395-0000 WHY SHOULD NOT I GO AND YOU STAY IN THE BOAT AT THIS XURY SAID IF WILD MANS COME THEY EAT ME YOU GO WAY
7769-99395-0001 WELL SAID I
7769-99395-0002 THEY SHALL NOT EAT YOU OR ME
7769-99395-0003 AND CAME BACK WITH A HARE THAT HE HAD SHOT WHICH WE WERE GLAD TO COOK AND EAT
7769-99395-0004 AND HAD SEEN NO WILD MEN I MADE A GUESS
7769-99395-0005 FOR I SAW THE TOP OF THE GREAT PEAK WHICH I KNEW WAS NEAR THEM MY ONE HOPE WAS THAT IF I KEPT NEAR THE COAST I SHOULD FIND SOME SHIP THAT WOULD TAKE US ON BOARD AND THEN AND NOT TILL THEN
7769-99395-0006 SHOULD I FEEL A FREE MAN
7769-99395-0007 THAT I MUST MEET WITH SOME SHIP OR DIE
7769-99395-0008 WHO STOOD TO LOOK AT US THEY WERE BLACK AND WORE NO CLOTHES
7769-99395-0009 WHO KNEW BEST SAID NOT YOU GO NOT YOU GO SO I BROUGHT THE BOAT AS NEAR THE LAND AS I COULD THAT I MIGHT TALK TO THEM AND THEY KEPT UP WITH ME A LONG WAY
7769-99395-0010 I MADE SIGNS THAT THEY SHOULD BRING ME SOME FOOD AND THEY ON THEIR PART MADE SIGNS FOR ME TO STOP MY BOAT SO I LET DOWN THE TOP OF MY SAIL AND LAY BY
7769-99395-0011 AND IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR THEY CAME BACK WITH SOME DRY MEAT AND A SORT OF CORN WHICH IS GROWN IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD
7769-99395-0012 NOR DID THEY DARE TO COME TO US AT LAST THEY TOOK A SAFE WAY FOR US ALL FOR THEY BROUGHT THE FOOD TO THE SHORE WHERE THEY SET IT DOWN
7769-99395-0013 BUT AS GOOD LUCK WOULD HAVE IT WE WERE AT HAND TO TAKE A GREAT PRIZE FOR THEM FOR TWO WILD BEASTS OF THE SAME KIND AS THE FIRST I SPOKE OF CAME IN FULL CHASE FROM THE HILLS DOWN TO THE SEA
7769-99395-0014 ONE OF THESE BEASTS CAME NEAR OUR BOAT SO I LAY IN WAIT FOR HIM WITH MY GUN AND AS SOON AS THE BRUTE WAS IN RANGE I SHOT HIM THROUGH THE HEAD TWICE HE SANK DOWN IN THE SEA AND TWICE HE CAME UP
7769-99395-0015 AND THEN JUST SWAM TO THE LAND WHERE HE FELL DOWN DEAD THE MEN WERE IN AS MUCH FEAR AT THE SOUND OF MY GUN AS THEY HAD BEEN AT THE SIGHT OF THE BEASTS BUT WHEN I MADE SIGNS FOR THEM TO COME TO THE SHORE
7769-99395-0016 THEY TOOK HEART AND CAME THEY AT ONCE MADE FOR THEIR PRIZE AND BY THE HELP OF A ROPE WHICH THEY SLUNG ROUND HIM THEY BROUGHT HIM SAFE ON THE BEACH
7769-99395-0017 THE LAND IN FRONT OF US RAN OUT FOUR OR FIVE MILES LIKE A BILL AND WE HAD TO KEEP SOME WAY FROM THE COAST TO MAKE THIS POINT SO THAT WE LOST SIGHT OF THE SHORE
7769-99395-0018 WHEN ALL AT ONCE I HEARD THE LAD CRY OUT A SHIP WITH A SAIL A SHIP WITH A SAIL
7769-99395-0019 BUT I KNEW WELL FROM THE LOOK OF HER THAT SHE WAS NOT ONE OF THE TURK'S I MADE ALL THE SAIL I COULD TO COME IN THE SHIP'S WAY
7769-99395-0020 IN THE HOPE THAT IF THOSE ON DECK COULD NOT HEAR THE SOUND THEY MIGHT SEE THE SMOKE THIS THEY DID SEE AND THEN LET DOWN THEIR SAILS SO THAT WE MIGHT COME UP TO THEM
7769-99395-0021 THE MEN SPOKE TO US IN FRENCH
7769-99395-0022 AT LAST A SCOT ON BOARD SAID IN MY OWN TONGUE WHO ARE YOU WHENCE DO YOU COME I TOLD HIM IN A FEW WORDS HOW I HAD GOT FREE FROM THE MOORS THEN THE MAN WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE SHIP BADE ME COME ON BOARD
7769-99395-0023 I TOLD HIM THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ALL I HAD BUT HE SAID
7769-99395-0024 FOR I HAVE BUT DONE FOR YOU WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE FOR ME HAD I BEEN IN THE SAME PLIGHT
7769-99395-0025 BUT I TOLD HIM THAT AS IT WAS BY THE BOY'S HELP THAT I HAD GOT FREE
7769-99395-0026 HE SAID IT WAS JUST AND RIGHT IN ME TO FEEL THUS BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF I COULD MAKE UP MY MIND TO PART WITH HIM HE SHOULD BE SET FREE IN TWO YEARS TIME SO
7769-99395-0027 AND WAS NOW A FREE MAN I HAD MADE A GOOD SUM BY ALL MY STORE
7769-99395-0028 AT LENGTH I MET WITH A MAN WHOSE CASE WAS MUCH THE SAME AS MY OWN AND WE BOTH TOOK SOME LAND TO FARM MY STOCK LIKE HIS WAS LOW BUT WE MADE OUR FARMS SERVE TO KEEP US IN FOOD
7769-99395-0029 THOUGH NOT MORE THAN THAT
7769-99395-0030 ROUND ME AND TO ADD TO MY GRIEF THE KIND FRIEND WHO HAD BROUGHT ME HERE IN HIS SHIP NOW MEANT TO LEAVE THESE SHORES ON MY FIRST START TO SEA WHEN A BOY
7769-99395-0031 I HAD PUT A SMALL SUM IN THE HANDS OF AN AUNT AND THIS MY FRIEND SAID I SHOULD DO WELL TO SPEND ON MY FARM SO WHEN HE GOT HOME HE SENT SOME OF IT IN CASH
7769-99395-0032 AND SUCH LIKE GOODS MY AUNT HAD PUT A FEW POUNDS IN MY FRIEND'S HANDS AS A GIFT TO HIM
7769-99395-0033 AND WITH THIS SUM HE WAS SO KIND AS TO BUY ME A SLAVE IN THE MEAN TIME I HAD BOUGHT A SLAVE SO NOW I HAD TWO
7769-99395-0034 ONE DAY SOME MEN CAME TO ASK ME TO TAKE CHARGE OF A SLAVE SHIP TO BE SENT OUT BY THEM THEY SAID THEY WOULD GIVE ME A SHARE IN THE SLAVES AND PAY THE COST OF THE STOCK
7769-99395-0035 THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD THING FOR ME IF I HAD NOT HAD FARMS AND LAND
7769-99395-0036 FOR I HAD MADE A LARGE SUM
7769-99395-0037 WELL I TOLD THESE MEN THAT I WOULD GO WITH ALL MY HEART IF THEY WOULD LOOK TO MY FARM IN THE MEAN TIME WHICH THEY SAID THEY WOULD DO SO
7769-99395-0038 SHE HAD SIX GUNS TWELVE MEN AND A BOY WE TOOK WITH US SAWS CHAINS TOYS BEADS BITS OF GLASS
7769-99395-0039 WE KNEW NOT WHERE ALL AT ONCE THERE WAS A CRY OF
7769-99395-0040 AND THE SHIP STRUCK ON A BANK OF SAND IN WHICH SHE SANK SO DEEP THAT WE COULD NOT GET HER OFF
7769-99395-0041 THERE HAD BEEN A BOAT AT HER STERN BUT WE FOUND IT HAD BEEN TORN OFF BY THE FORCE OF THE WAVES ONE SMALL BOAT WAS STILL LEFT ON THE SHIP'S SIDE SO
7769-99395-0042 THE HEART OF EACH NOW GREW FAINT OUR CHEEKS WERE PALE AND OUR EYES WERE DIM FOR THERE WAS BUT ONE HOPE AND THAT WAS TO FIND SOME BAY AND SO GET IN THE LEE OF THE LAND
7769-99395-0043 WE NOW GAVE UP OUR WHOLE SOULS TO GOD THE SEA GREW MORE AND MORE ROUGH AND ITS WHITE FOAM WOULD CURL AND BOIL
7769-99395-0044 BURST ON THE BOAT'S SIDE
7769-99395-0045 AT LENGTH ONE LARGE WAVE TOOK ME TO THE SHORE AND LEFT ME HIGH AND DRY THOUGH HALF DEAD WITH FEAR
7769-99395-0046 BUT JUST THEN THE CURVE OF A HUGE WAVE ROSE UP AS HIGH AS A HILL AND THIS I HAD NO STRENGTH TO KEEP FROM SO IT TOOK ME BACK TO THE SEA
7769-99395-0047 I DID MY BEST TO FLOAT ON THE TOP AND HELD MY BREATH TO DO SO THE NEXT WAVE WAS QUITE AS HIGH AND SHUT ME UP IN ITS BULK I HELD MY HANDS DOWN TIGHT TO MY SIDE
7769-99395-0048 AND THEN MY HEAD SHOT OUT AT THE TOP OF THE WAVES THIS GAVE ME HEART AND BREATH TOO AND SOON MY FEET FELT THE GROUND I STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A SHORT TIME TO LET THE SEA RUN BACK FROM ME
7769-99395-0049 AND THEN I SET OFF WITH ALL MY MIGHT TO THE SHORE
7769-99395-0050 AND TWICE MORE LAND ME ON THE SHORE I THOUGHT THE LAST WAVE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE DEATH OF ME
7769-99395-0051 AND WITH SUCH FORCE AS TO LEAVE ME IN A KIND OF SWOON WHICH THANK GOD DID NOT LAST LONG
7769-99395-0052 TO MY GREAT JOY I GOT UP TO THE CLIFFS CLOSE TO THE SHORE WHERE I FOUND SOME GRASS OUT OF THE REACH OF THE SEA THERE I SAT DOWN SAFE ON LAND AT LAST
7769-99395-0053 I COULD BUT CRY OUT IN THE WORDS OF THE PSALM THEY THAT GO DOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS THESE MEN SEE THE WORKS OF THE LORD IN THE DEEP FOR AT HIS WORD THE STORMS RISE
7769-99395-0054 THEN DO THEY MOUNT TO THE SKY AND FROM THENCE GO DOWN TO THE DEEP MY SOUL FAINTS I REEL TO AND FRO AND AM AT MY WIT'S END
7769-99395-0055 THEN THE LORD BRINGS ME OUT OF ALL MY FEARS
7769-99395-0056 NOW LIFT UP MY HANDS NOW FOLD THEM ON MY BREAST AND THANK GOD FOR ALL THAT HE HAD DONE FOR ME WHEN THE REST OF THE MEN WERE LOST
7769-99395-0057 AND I WAS SAFE I NOW CAST MY EYES ROUND ME
7769-99395-0058 LIKE A BIRD IN A STORM THEN ALL THE GLEE I FELT AT FIRST LEFT ME
