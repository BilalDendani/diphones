5147-32136-0000 CHAPTER TWO THE EGYPTIAN COLONY WHAT PROOFS HAVE WE THAT THE EGYPTIANS WERE A COLONY FROM ATLANTIS
5147-32136-0001 THE EGYPTIANS DERIVED THEIR CIVILIZATION FROM THEM AND AS THE EGYPTIANS FAR ANTEDATED THE RISE OF THE PHOENICIAN NATIONS PROPER THIS MUST HAVE MEANT THAT EGYPT DERIVED ITS CIVILIZATION FROM THE SAME COUNTRY TO WHICH THE PHOENICIANS OWED THEIR OWN ORIGIN THE PHOENICIAN LEGENDS
5147-32136-0002 WAS THE CHILD OF THE PHOENICIAN GODS
5147-32136-0003 MISOR GAVE BIRTH TO TAAUT THE GOD OF LETTERS THE INVENTOR OF THE ALPHABET AND TAAUT BECAME THOTH THE GOD OF HISTORY OF THE EGYPTIANS
5147-32136-0004 AND RA WAS THE SUN GOD OF EGYPT
5147-32136-0005 RANA A GOD OF THE TOLTECS RAYMI THE GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE SUN OF THE PERUVIANS AND RAYAM A GOD OF YEMEN
5147-32136-0006 NINE WE FIND ANOTHER PROOF OF THE DESCENT OF THE EGYPTIANS FROM ATLANTIS IN THEIR BELIEF AS TO THE UNDER WORLD THIS LAND OF THE DEAD WAS SITUATED IN THE WEST HENCE THE TOMBS WERE ALL PLACED WHENEVER POSSIBLE ON THE WEST BANK OF THE NILE
5147-32136-0007 THE CONSTANT CRY OF THE MOURNERS AS THE FUNERAL PROCESSION MOVED FORWARD WAS TO THE WEST TO THE WEST THIS UNDER WORLD WAS BEYOND THE WATER HENCE THE FUNERAL PROCESSION ALWAYS CROSSED A BODY OF WATER WHERE THE TOMBS WERE AS IN MOST CASES
5147-32136-0008 ON THE WEST BANK OF THE NILE THE NILE WAS CROSSED
5147-32136-0009 THE MOST WESTERN CAPE PROJECTING INTO THE ATLANTIC IT WAS ONLY TO BE REACHED FROM EGYPT BY CROSSING THE WATER AND IT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ARK THE EMBLEM OF ATLANTIS IN ALL LANDS THE SOUL OF THE DEAD MAN WAS SUPPOSED TO JOURNEY TO THE UNDER WORLD BY A WATER PROGRESS
5147-32136-0010 HIS DESTINATION WAS THE ELYSIAN FIELDS WHERE MIGHTY CORN GREW AND WHERE HE WAS EXPECTED TO CULTIVATE THE EARTH THIS TASK WAS OF SUPREME IMPORTANCE
5147-32136-0011 A NAME WHICH REMINDS US OF THE ATLANTEAN GOD URANOS IN CONNECTION WITH ALL THIS WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT PLATO DESCRIBED ATLANTIS AS THAT SACRED ISLAND LYING BENEATH THE SUN EVERYWHERE IN THE ANCIENT WORLD WE FIND THE MINDS OF MEN LOOKING TO THE WEST FOR THE LAND OF THE DEAD
5147-32136-0012 THAT UNDER AN IMMENSE OCEAN IN THE FAR WEST THERE WAS AN UNDER WORLD A WORLD COMPRISING MILLIONS OF THE DEAD A MIGHTY RACE THAT HAD BEEN SUDDENLY SWALLOWED UP IN THE GREATEST CATASTROPHE KNOWN TO MAN SINCE HE HAD INHABITED THE GLOBE
5147-32136-0013 TO USE THE WORDS OF A RECENT WRITER IN BLACKWOOD
5147-32136-0014 THEN LEPSIUS FOUND THE HIEROGLYPHIC SIGN OF THE PAPYRUS ROLL ON MONUMENTS OF THE TWELFTH DYNASTY AFTERWARD HE FOUND THE SAME SIGN ON MONUMENTS OF THE FOURTH DYNASTY WHICH IS GETTING BACK PRETTY CLOSE TO MENES THE PROTOMONARCH AND INDEED LITTLE DOUBT IS ENTERTAINED
5147-32136-0015 THAT THE ART OF WRITING ON PAPYRUS WAS UNDERSTOOD AS EARLY AS THE DAYS OF MENES HIMSELF THE FRUITS OF INVESTIGATION IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER SUBJECTS ARE TRULY MOST MARVELLOUS
5147-32136-0016 INSTEAD OF EXHIBITING THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF ANY BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE THEY TEND TO PROVE THAT NOTHING HAD ANY RISE OR PROGRESS BUT THAT EVERYTHING IS REFERABLE TO THE VERY EARLIEST DATES THE EXPERIENCE OF THE EGYPTOLOGIST
5147-32136-0017 AND TO SPECT THAT NOTHING GROWED BUT THAT AS SOON AS MEN WERE PLANTED ON THE BANKS OF THE NILE THEY WERE ALREADY THE CLEVEREST MEN THAT EVER LIVED ENDOWED WITH MORE KNOWLEDGE AND MORE POWER THAN THEIR SUCCESSORS FOR CENTURIES AND CENTURIES COULD ATTAIN TO
5147-32136-0018 HOW SHALL WE SUPPORT THE THEORY IF IT COME TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THAT BEFORE NOAH WAS COLD IN HIS GRAVE HIS DESCENDANTS WERE ADEPTS IN CONSTRUCTION AND IN THE FINE ARTS AND THAT THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS WERE FOR MAGNITUDE SUCH AS IF WE POSSESS THE REQUISITE SKILL
5147-32136-0019 AS WE HAVE NOT YET DISCOVERED ANY TRACE OF THE RUDE SAVAGE EGYPT BUT HAVE SEEN HER IN HER VERY EARLIEST MANIFESTATIONS ALREADY SKILFUL ERUDITE AND STRONG IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE ORDER OF HER INVENTIONS
5147-32136-0020 LIGHT MAY YET BE THROWN UPON HER RISE AND PROGRESS BUT OUR DEEPEST RESEARCHES HAVE HITHERTO SHOWN HER TO US AS ONLY THE MOTHER OF A MOST ACCOMPLISHED RACE HOW THEY CAME BY THEIR KNOWLEDGE IS MATTER FOR SPECULATION THAT THEY POSSESSED IT IS MATTER OF FACT
5147-32136-0021 IN QUARRYING ROCK IN BUILDING AND IN SCULPTURE THE EXPLANATION IS SIMPLE THE WATERS OF THE ATLANTIC NOW FLOW OVER THE COUNTRY WHERE ALL THIS MAGNIFICENCE AND POWER WERE DEVELOPED BY SLOW STAGES FROM THE RUDE BEGINNINGS OF BARBARISM
5147-32136-0022 EGYPT WAS THE MAGNIFICENT THE GOLDEN BRIDGE TEN THOUSAND YEARS LONG GLORIOUS WITH TEMPLES AND PYRAMIDS ILLUMINATED AND ILLUSTRATED BY THE MOST COMPLETE AND CONTINUOUS RECORDS OF HUMAN HISTORY ALONG WHICH THE CIVILIZATION OF ATLANTIS
5147-32136-0023 IN A GREAT PROCESSION OF KINGS AND PRIESTS PHILOSOPHERS AND ASTRONOMERS ARTISTS AND ARTISANS STREAMED FORWARD TO GREECE TO ROME TO EUROPE TO AMERICA AS FAR BACK IN THE AGES AS THE EYE CAN PENETRATE EVEN WHERE THE PERSPECTIVE DWINDLES ALMOST TO A POINT
5147-32136-0024 WE CAN STILL SEE THE SWARMING MULTITUDES POSSESSED OF ALL THE ARTS OF THE HIGHEST CIVILIZATION PRESSING FORWARD FROM OUT THAT OTHER AND GREATER EMPIRE OF WHICH EVEN THIS WONDERWORKING NILE LAND IS BUT A FAINT AND IMPERFECT COPY
5147-32136-0025 LOOK AT THE RECORD OF EGYPTIAN GREATNESS AS PRESERVED IN HER WORKS THE PYRAMIDS STILL IN THEIR RUINS ARE THE MARVEL OF MANKIND THE RIVER NILE WAS DIVERTED FROM ITS COURSE BY MONSTROUS EMBANKMENTS TO MAKE A PLACE FOR THE CITY OF MEMPHIS THE ARTIFICIAL LAKE OF MOERIS
5147-32136-0026 WAS CREATED AS A RESERVOIR FOR THE WATERS OF THE NILE IT WAS FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE AND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET DEEP WITH SUBTERRANEAN CHANNELS FLOOD GATES LOCKS AND DAMS BY WHICH THE WILDERNESS WAS REDEEMED FROM STERILITY
5147-32136-0027 THE JOINTS ARE SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE AND NOT WIDER THAN THE THICKNESS OF SILVER PAPER AND THE CEMENT SO TENACIOUS THAT FRAGMENTS OF THE CASING STONES STILL REMAIN IN THEIR ORIGINAL POSITION NOTWITHSTANDING THE LAPSE OF SO MANY CENTURIES AND THE VIOLENCE BY WHICH THEY WERE DETACHED
5147-32136-0028 COVERING A SQUARE EACH SIDE OF WHICH IS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FEET
5147-32136-0029 THEY HAVE BEEN ASTOUNDED AND OVERCOME BY THE MAGNIFICENCE AND THE PRODIGALITY OF WORKMANSHIP HERE TO BE ADMIRED COURTS HALLS GATE WAYS PILLARS
5147-32136-0030 MONOLITHIC FIGURES SCULPTURES ROWS OF SPHINXES ARE MASSED IN SUCH PROFUSION THAT THE SIGHT IS TOO MUCH FOR MODERN COMPREHENSION DENON SAYS
5147-32136-0031 IT IS HARDLY POSSIBLE TO BELIEVE AFTER HAVING SEEN IT IN THE REALITY OF THE EXISTENCE OF SO MANY BUILDINGS COLLECTED ON A SINGLE POINT IN THEIR DIMENSIONS IN THE RESOLUTE PERSEVERANCE WHICH THEIR CONSTRUCTION REQUIRED
5147-32136-0032 THE CATHEDRAL OF NOTRE DAME AT PARIS COULD BE SET INSIDE ONE OF THE HALLS OF KARNAC AND NOT TOUCH THE WALLS THE WHOLE VALLEY AND DELTA OF THE NILE FROM THE CATACOMBS TO THE SEA WAS COVERED WITH TEMPLES PALACES TOMBS PYRAMIDS AND PILLARS
5147-32136-0033 THE STATE OF SOCIETY IN THE EARLY DAYS OF EGYPT APPROXIMATED VERY CLOSELY TO OUR MODERN CIVILIZATION
5147-32136-0034 FORTY TWO COMMANDMENTS PRESCRIBED THE DUTIES OF MEN TO THEMSELVES THEIR NEIGHBORS THEIR COUNTRY AND THE DEITY A HEAVEN AWAITED THE GOOD AND A HELL THE VICIOUS THERE WAS A JUDGMENT DAY WHEN THE HEARTS OF MEN WERE WEIGHED
5147-32136-0035 HE IS SIFTING OUT THE HEARTS OF MEN BEFORE HIS JUDGMENT SEAT MONOGAMY WAS THE STRICT RULE NOT EVEN THE KINGS IN THE EARLY DAYS WERE ALLOWED TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE WIFE THE WIFE'S RIGHTS OF SEPARATE PROPERTY AND HER DOWER WERE PROTECTED BY LAW
