3328-168626-0000 THE LITTLE ONE ALL ALONE AS THE THENARDIER HOSTELRY WAS IN THAT PART OF THE VILLAGE WHICH IS NEAR THE CHURCH IT WAS TO THE SPRING IN THE FOREST IN THE DIRECTION OF CHELLES THAT COSETTE WAS OBLIGED TO GO FOR HER WATER
3328-168626-0001 SHE MADE AS MUCH MOTION AS POSSIBLE WITH THE HANDLE OF THE BUCKET AS SHE WALKED ALONG THIS MADE A NOISE WHICH AFFORDED HER COMPANY THE FURTHER SHE WENT THE DENSER THE DARKNESS BECAME THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE STREETS
3328-168626-0002 HOWEVER SHE DID ENCOUNTER A WOMAN WHO TURNED AROUND ON SEEING HER
3328-168626-0003 IS IT A WEREWOLF CHILD THEN THE WOMAN RECOGNIZED COSETTE WELL SAID SHE IT'S THE LARK
3328-168626-0004 SO LONG AS SHE HAD THE HOUSES OR EVEN THE WALLS ONLY ON BOTH SIDES OF HER PATH SHE PROCEEDED WITH TOLERABLE BOLDNESS FROM TIME TO TIME SHE CAUGHT THE FLICKER OF A CANDLE THROUGH THE CRACK OF A SHUTTER THIS WAS LIGHT AND LIFE
3328-168626-0005 THERE WERE PEOPLE THERE AND IT REASSURED HER BUT IN PROPORTION AS SHE ADVANCED HER PACE SLACKENED MECHANICALLY AS IT WERE WHEN SHE HAD PASSED THE CORNER OF THE LAST HOUSE COSETTE PAUSED
3328-168626-0006 IT HAD BEEN HARD TO ADVANCE FURTHER THAN THE LAST STALL IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED FURTHER THAN THE LAST HOUSE SHE SET HER BUCKET ON THE GROUND THRUST HER HAND INTO HER HAIR AND BEGAN SLOWLY TO SCRATCH HER HEAD
3328-168626-0007 A GESTURE PECULIAR TO CHILDREN WHEN TERRIFIED AND UNDECIDED WHAT TO DO
3328-168626-0008 IT WAS THE OPEN FIELDS BLACK AND DESERT SPACE WAS BEFORE HER SHE GAZED IN DESPAIR AT THAT DARKNESS WHERE THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ONE WHERE THERE WERE BEASTS
3328-168626-0009 WHERE THERE WERE SPECTRES POSSIBLY SHE TOOK A GOOD LOOK AND HEARD THE BEASTS WALKING ON THE GRASS AND SHE DISTINCTLY SAW SPECTRES MOVING IN THE TREES THEN SHE SEIZED HER BUCKET AGAIN
3328-168626-0010 FEAR HAD LENT HER AUDACITY BAH SAID SHE I WILL TELL HIM THAT THERE WAS NO MORE WATER
3328-168626-0011 HARDLY HAD SHE GONE A HUNDRED PACES WHEN SHE PAUSED AND BEGAN TO SCRATCH HER HEAD AGAIN NOW IT WAS THE THENARDIER WHO APPEARED TO HER WITH HER HIDEOUS HYENA MOUTH AND WRATH FLASHING IN HER EYES
3328-168626-0012 THE CHILD CAST A MELANCHOLY GLANCE BEFORE HER AND BEHIND HER WHAT WAS SHE TO DO WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF HER WHERE WAS SHE TO GO IN FRONT OF HER WAS THE SPECTRE OF THE THENARDIER
3328-168626-0013 SHE ENTERED THE FOREST AT A RUN NO LONGER LOOKING AT OR LISTENING TO ANYTHING SHE ONLY PAUSED IN HER COURSE WHEN HER BREATH FAILED HER BUT SHE DID NOT HALT IN HER ADVANCE SHE WENT STRAIGHT BEFORE HER IN DESPERATION
3328-168626-0014 AS SHE RAN SHE FELT LIKE CRYING THE NOCTURNAL QUIVERING OF THE FOREST SURROUNDED HER COMPLETELY SHE NO LONGER THOUGHT SHE NO LONGER SAW THE IMMENSITY OF NIGHT WAS FACING THIS TINY CREATURE
3328-168626-0015 ON THE ONE HAND ALL SHADOW ON THE OTHER AN ATOM IT WAS ONLY SEVEN OR EIGHT MINUTES WALK FROM THE EDGE OF THE WOODS TO THE SPRING COSETTE KNEW THE WAY THROUGH HAVING GONE OVER IT MANY TIMES IN DAYLIGHT
3328-168626-0016 STRANGE TO SAY SHE DID NOT GET LOST A REMNANT OF INSTINCT GUIDED HER VAGUELY BUT SHE DID NOT TURN HER EYES EITHER TO RIGHT OR TO LEFT FOR FEAR OF SEEING THINGS IN THE BRANCHES AND IN THE BRUSHWOOD
3328-168626-0017 IN THIS MANNER SHE REACHED THE SPRING IT WAS A NARROW NATURAL BASIN HOLLOWED OUT BY THE WATER IN A CLAYEY SOIL ABOUT TWO FEET DEEP
3328-168626-0018 AND PAVED WITH SEVERAL LARGE STONES A BROOK RAN OUT OF IT WITH A TRANQUIL LITTLE NOISE COSETTE DID NOT TAKE TIME TO BREATHE IT WAS VERY DARK BUT SHE WAS IN THE HABIT OF COMING TO THIS SPRING
3328-168626-0019 FOUND ONE OF ITS BRANCHES CLUNG TO IT
3328-168626-0020 SHE WAS IN A STATE OF SUCH VIOLENT EXCITEMENT THAT HER STRENGTH WAS TREBLED WHILE THUS BENT OVER SHE DID NOT NOTICE THAT THE POCKET OF HER APRON HAD EMPTIED ITSELF INTO THE SPRING
3328-168626-0021 COSETTE NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD IT FALL SHE DREW OUT THE BUCKET NEARLY FULL AND SET IT ON THE GRASS THAT DONE SHE PERCEIVED THAT SHE WAS WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE
3328-168626-0022 SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SET OUT AGAIN AT ONCE BUT THE EFFORT REQUIRED TO FILL THE BUCKET HAD BEEN SUCH THAT SHE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A STEP SHE WAS FORCED TO SIT DOWN SHE DROPPED ON THE GRASS AND REMAINED CROUCHING THERE
3328-168626-0023 WITHOUT KNOWING WHY BUT BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE THE AGITATED WATER IN THE BUCKET BESIDE HER WAS DESCRIBING CIRCLES WHICH RESEMBLED TIN SERPENTS OVERHEAD THE SKY WAS COVERED WITH VAST BLACK CLOUDS
3328-168626-0024 WHICH WERE LIKE MASSES OF SMOKE THE TRAGIC MASK OF SHADOW SEEMED TO BEND VAGUELY OVER THE CHILD JUPITER WAS SETTING IN THE DEPTHS THE CHILD STARED WITH BEWILDERED EYES AT THIS GREAT STAR
3328-168626-0025 WITH WHICH SHE WAS UNFAMILIAR AND WHICH TERRIFIED HER THE PLANET WAS IN FACT VERY NEAR THE HORIZON AND WAS TRAVERSING A DENSE LAYER OF MIST WHICH IMPARTED TO IT A HORRIBLE RUDDY HUE
3328-168626-0026 THE MIST GLOOMILY EMPURPLED MAGNIFIED THE STAR ONE WOULD HAVE CALLED IT A LUMINOUS WOUND A COLD WIND WAS BLOWING FROM THE PLAIN THE FOREST WAS DARK NOT A LEAF WAS MOVING
3328-168626-0027 THERE WERE NONE OF THE VAGUE FRESH GLEAMS OF SUMMERTIDE GREAT BOUGHS UPLIFTED THEMSELVES IN FRIGHTFUL WISE SLENDER AND MISSHAPEN BUSHES WHISTLED IN THE CLEARINGS THE TALL GRASSES UNDULATED LIKE EELS UNDER THE NORTH WIND
3328-168626-0028 THE NETTLES SEEMED TO TWIST LONG ARMS FURNISHED WITH CLAWS IN SEARCH OF PREY SOME BITS OF DRY HEATHER TOSSED BY THE BREEZE FLEW RAPIDLY BY AND HAD THE AIR OF FLEEING IN TERROR BEFORE SOMETHING WHICH WAS COMING AFTER
3328-168626-0029 ON ALL SIDES THERE WERE LUGUBRIOUS STRETCHES THE DARKNESS WAS BEWILDERING MAN REQUIRES LIGHT WHOEVER BURIES HIMSELF IN THE OPPOSITE OF DAY FEELS HIS HEART CONTRACT
3328-168626-0030 WHEN THE EYE SEES BLACK THE HEART SEES TROUBLE IN AN ECLIPSE IN THE NIGHT IN THE SOOTY OPACITY THERE IS ANXIETY EVEN FOR THE STOUTEST OF HEARTS NO ONE WALKS ALONE IN THE FOREST AT NIGHT WITHOUT TREMBLING
3328-168626-0031 SHADOWS AND TREES TWO FORMIDABLE DENSITIES
3328-168626-0032 APPEARS IN THE INDISTINCT DEPTHS THE INCONCEIVABLE IS OUTLINED A FEW PACES DISTANT FROM YOU WITH A SPECTRAL CLEARNESS ONE BEHOLDS FLOATING EITHER IN SPACE OR IN ONE'S OWN BRAIN
3328-168626-0033 ONE KNOWS NOT WHAT VAGUE AND INTANGIBLE THING LIKE THE DREAMS OF SLEEPING FLOWERS THERE ARE FIERCE ATTITUDES ON THE HORIZON
3328-168626-0034 ONE IS AFRAID TO GLANCE BEHIND HIM YET DESIROUS OF DOING SO THE CAVITIES OF NIGHT THINGS GROWN HAGGARD TACITURN PROFILES WHICH VANISH WHEN ONE ADVANCES OBSCURE DISHEVELMENTS IRRITATED TUFTS
3328-168626-0035 LIVID POOLS THE LUGUBRIOUS REFLECTED IN THE FUNEREAL
3328-168626-0036 OF SILENCE UNKNOWN BUT POSSIBLE BEINGS BENDINGS OF MYSTERIOUS BRANCHES ALARMING TORSOS OF TREES LONG HANDFULS OF QUIVERING PLANTS AGAINST ALL THIS ONE HAS NO PROTECTION
3328-168626-0037 THIS PENETRATION OF THE SHADOWS IS INDESCRIBABLY SINISTER IN THE CASE OF A CHILD
3328-168626-0038 WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING HER SENSATIONS COSETTE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT SHE WAS SEIZED UPON BY THAT BLACK ENORMITY OF NATURE IT WAS NO LONGER TERROR ALONE WHICH WAS GAINING POSSESSION OF HER IT WAS SOMETHING MORE TERRIBLE
3328-168626-0039 EVEN THAN TERROR SHE SHIVERED THERE ARE NO WORDS TO EXPRESS THE STRANGENESS OF THAT SHIVER
3328-168626-0040 THEN BY A SORT OF INSTINCT SHE BEGAN TO COUNT ALOUD ONE TWO THREE FOUR AND SO ON UP TO TEN IN ORDER TO ESCAPE FROM THAT SINGULAR STATE WHICH SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND BUT WHICH TERRIFIED HER
3328-168626-0041 AND WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE BEGAN AGAIN THIS RESTORED HER TO A TRUE PERCEPTION OF THE THINGS ABOUT HER HER HANDS WHICH SHE HAD WET IN DRAWING THE WATER FELT COLD SHE ROSE
3328-168626-0042 HER TERROR A NATURAL AND UNCONQUERABLE TERROR HAD RETURNED SHE HAD BUT ONE THOUGHT NOW TO FLEE AT FULL SPEED THROUGH THE FOREST ACROSS THE FIELDS TO THE HOUSES TO THE WINDOWS TO THE LIGHTED CANDLES
3328-168626-0043 HER GLANCE FELL UPON THE WATER WHICH STOOD BEFORE HER SUCH WAS THE FRIGHT WHICH THE THENARDIER INSPIRED IN HER THAT SHE DARED NOT FLEE WITHOUT THAT BUCKET OF WATER SHE SEIZED THE HANDLE WITH BOTH HANDS SHE COULD HARDLY LIFT THE PAIL
3328-168626-0044 IN THIS MANNER SHE ADVANCED A DOZEN PACES BUT THE BUCKET WAS FULL IT WAS HEAVY SHE WAS FORCED TO SET IT ON THE GROUND ONCE MORE SHE TOOK BREATH FOR AN INSTANT THEN LIFTED THE HANDLE OF THE BUCKET AGAIN
3328-168626-0045 AGAIN SHE WAS OBLIGED TO PAUSE AFTER SOME SECONDS OF REPOSE SHE SET OUT AGAIN SHE WALKED BENT FORWARD WITH DROOPING HEAD LIKE AN OLD WOMAN THE WEIGHT OF THE BUCKET STRAINED AND STIFFENED HER THIN ARMS
3328-168626-0046 THE IRON HANDLE COMPLETED THE BENUMBING AND FREEZING OF HER WET AND TINY HANDS SHE WAS FORCED TO HALT FROM TIME TO TIME AND EACH TIME THAT SHE DID SO THE COLD WATER WHICH SPLASHED FROM THE PAIL FELL ON HER BARE LEGS
3328-168626-0047 THIS TOOK PLACE IN THE DEPTHS OF A FOREST AT NIGHT IN WINTER FAR FROM ALL HUMAN SIGHT SHE WAS A CHILD OF EIGHT
3328-168626-0048 AND HER MOTHER NO DOUBT ALAS FOR THERE ARE THINGS THAT MAKE THE DEAD OPEN THEIR EYES IN THEIR GRAVES SHE PANTED WITH A SORT OF PAINFUL RATTLE SOBS CONTRACTED HER THROAT BUT SHE DARED NOT WEEP
3328-168626-0049 IN SPITE OF DIMINISHING THE LENGTH OF HER STOPS AND OF WALKING AS LONG AS POSSIBLE BETWEEN THEM
3328-168626-0050 AND THAT THE THENARDIER WOULD BEAT HER THIS ANGUISH WAS MINGLED WITH HER TERROR AT BEING ALONE IN THE WOODS AT NIGHT SHE WAS WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE AND HAD NOT YET EMERGED FROM THE FOREST
3328-168626-0051 ON ARRIVING NEAR AN OLD CHESTNUT TREE WITH WHICH SHE WAS ACQUAINTED MADE A LAST HALT LONGER THAN THE REST IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT GET WELL RESTED
3328-168626-0052 THEN SHE SUMMONED UP ALL HER STRENGTH PICKED UP HER BUCKET AGAIN AND COURAGEOUSLY RESUMED HER MARCH
3328-168626-0053 AT THAT MOMENT SHE SUDDENLY BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT HER BUCKET NO LONGER WEIGHED ANYTHING AT ALL A HAND WHICH SEEMED TO HER ENORMOUS HAD JUST SEIZED THE HANDLE AND LIFTED IT VIGOROUSLY SHE RAISED HER HEAD
3328-168626-0054 A LARGE BLACK FORM STRAIGHT AND ERECT WAS WALKING BESIDE HER THROUGH THE DARKNESS IT WAS A MAN WHO HAD COME UP BEHIND HER AND WHOSE APPROACH SHE HAD NOT HEARD THIS MAN WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HAD SEIZED THE HANDLE OF THE BUCKET WHICH SHE WAS CARRYING
3328-168626-0055 THERE ARE INSTINCTS FOR ALL THE ENCOUNTERS OF LIFE
