3638-758-0007 THE BOY WHO HAD ONCE DECLARED THAT HE KNEW WHO HAD FOUNDED TROY CRIED SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY AND HE BLUSHED UP TO HIS EARS LIKE A PEONY AS HE HAD DONE ON THAT OCCASION ALYOSHA WENT INTO THE ROOM
3638-758-0008 ILUSHA LAY WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED AND HIS EYES CLOSED IN A BLUE COFFIN WITH A WHITE FRILL ROUND IT HIS THIN FACE WAS HARDLY CHANGED AT ALL AND STRANGE TO SAY THERE WAS NO SMELL OF DECAY FROM THE CORPSE THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE WAS SERIOUS
3638-758-0009 AND HE WOULD NOT LOOK AT ANY ONE EVEN AT HIS CRAZY WEEPING WIFE MAMMA
3638-758-0010 NINA HAD BEEN PUSHED IN HER CHAIR BY THE BOYS CLOSE UP TO THE COFFIN SHE SAT WITH HER HEAD PRESSED TO IT AND SHE TOO WAS NO DOUBT QUIETLY WEEPING SNEGIRYOV'S FACE LOOKED EAGER YET BEWILDERED AND EXASPERATED
3638-758-0011 THERE WAS SOMETHING CRAZY ABOUT HIS GESTURES AND THE WORDS THAT BROKE FROM HIM OLD MAN DEAR OLD MAN HE EXCLAIMED EVERY MINUTE GAZING AT ILUSHA
3638-758-0012 AS A TERM OF AFFECTION WHEN HE WAS ALIVE FATHER GIVE ME A FLOWER TOO TAKE THAT WHITE ONE OUT OF HIS HAND AND GIVE IT ME THE CRAZY MOTHER BEGGED WHIMPERING
3638-758-0013 OR THAT SHE WANTED ONE FROM HIS HAND TO KEEP IN MEMORY OF HIM SHE MOVED RESTLESSLY STRETCHING OUT HER HANDS FOR THE FLOWER I WON'T GIVE IT TO ANY ONE I WON'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING SNEGIRYOV CRIED CALLOUSLY THEY ARE HIS FLOWERS NOT YOURS
3638-758-0014 EVERYTHING IS HIS NOTHING IS YOURS FATHER GIVE MOTHER A FLOWER SAID NINA LIFTING HER FACE WET WITH TEARS I WON'T GIVE AWAY ANYTHING AND TO HER LESS THAN ANY ONE
3638-758-0015 THE POOR CRAZY CREATURE WAS BATHED IN NOISELESS TEARS HIDING HER FACE IN HER HANDS THE BOYS SEEING THAT THE FATHER WOULD NOT LEAVE THE COFFIN AND THAT IT WAS TIME TO CARRY IT OUT STOOD ROUND IT IN A CLOSE CIRCLE AND BEGAN TO LIFT IT UP
3638-758-0016 I DON'T WANT HIM TO BE BURIED IN THE CHURCHYARD SNEGIRYOV WAILED SUDDENLY I'LL BURY HIM BY THE STONE BY OUR STONE ILUSHA TOLD ME TO I WON'T LET HIM BE CARRIED OUT HE HAD BEEN SAYING FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS THAT HE WOULD BURY HIM BY THE STONE
3638-758-0017 BUT ALYOSHA KRASSOTKIN THE LANDLADY HER SISTER AND ALL THE BOYS INTERFERED WHAT AN IDEA BURY HIM BY AN UNHOLY STONE AS THOUGH HE HAD HANGED HIMSELF THE OLD LANDLADY SAID STERNLY THERE IN THE CHURCHYARD THE GROUND HAS BEEN CROSSED
3638-758-0018 THE BOYS RAISED THE COFFIN BUT AS THEY PASSED THE MOTHER THEY STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND LOWERED IT THAT SHE MIGHT SAY GOOD BY TO ILUSHA BUT ON SEEING THAT PRECIOUS LITTLE FACE WHICH FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS SHE HAD ONLY LOOKED AT FROM A DISTANCE
3638-758-0019 SHE TREMBLED ALL OVER AND HER GRAY HEAD BEGAN TWITCHING SPASMODICALLY OVER THE COFFIN MOTHER MAKE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER HIM GIVE HIM YOUR BLESSING KISS HIM NINA CRIED TO HER BUT HER HEAD STILL TWITCHED LIKE AN AUTOMATON
3638-758-0020 AS ALYOSHA WENT OUT OF THE HOUSE HE BEGGED THE LANDLADY TO LOOK AFTER THOSE WHO WERE LEFT BEHIND BUT SHE INTERRUPTED HIM BEFORE HE HAD FINISHED TO BE SURE I'LL STAY WITH THEM WE ARE CHRISTIANS TOO THE OLD WOMAN WEPT AS SHE SAID IT
3638-758-0021 THEY HAD NOT FAR TO CARRY THE COFFIN TO THE CHURCH NOT MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED PACES IT WAS A STILL CLEAR DAY WITH A SLIGHT FROST THE CHURCH BELLS WERE STILL RINGING SNEGIRYOV RAN FUSSING AND DISTRACTED AFTER THE COFFIN
3638-758-0022 IN HIS SHORT OLD SUMMER OVERCOAT WITH HIS HEAD BARE AND HIS SOFT OLD WIDE BRIMMED HAT IN HIS HAND HE SEEMED IN A STATE OF BEWILDERED ANXIETY AT ONE MINUTE HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO SUPPORT THE HEAD OF THE COFFIN AND ONLY HINDERED THE BEARERS
3638-758-0023 AT ANOTHER HE RAN ALONGSIDE AND TRIED TO FIND A PLACE FOR HIMSELF THERE A FLOWER FELL ON THE SNOW AND HE RUSHED TO PICK IT UP AS THOUGH EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD DEPENDED ON THE LOSS OF THAT FLOWER AND THE CRUST OF BREAD WE'VE FORGOTTEN THE CRUST HE CRIED SUDDENLY IN DISMAY
3638-758-0024 BUT THE BOYS REMINDED HIM AT ONCE THAT HE HAD TAKEN THE CRUST OF BREAD ALREADY AND THAT IT WAS IN HIS POCKET HE INSTANTLY PULLED IT OUT AND WAS REASSURED ILUSHA TOLD ME TO ILUSHA
3638-758-0025 I WAS SITTING BY HIM ONE NIGHT AND HE SUDDENLY TOLD ME FATHER WHEN MY GRAVE IS FILLED UP CRUMBLE A PIECE OF BREAD ON IT SO THAT THE SPARROWS MAY FLY DOWN I SHALL HEAR AND IT WILL CHEER ME UP NOT TO BE LYING ALONE THAT'S A GOOD THING SAID ALYOSHA WE MUST OFTEN TAKE SOME
3638-758-0026 EVERY DAY EVERY DAY SAID THE CAPTAIN QUICKLY SEEMING CHEERED AT THE THOUGHT THEY REACHED THE CHURCH AT LAST AND SET THE COFFIN IN THE MIDDLE OF IT THE BOYS SURROUNDED IT AND REMAINED REVERENTLY STANDING SO ALL THROUGH THE SERVICE
3638-758-0027 IT WAS AN OLD AND RATHER POOR CHURCH MANY OF THE IKONS WERE WITHOUT SETTINGS BUT SUCH CHURCHES ARE THE BEST FOR PRAYING IN DURING THE MASS SNEGIRYOV BECAME SOMEWHAT CALMER THOUGH AT TIMES HE HAD OUTBURSTS OF THE SAME UNCONSCIOUS AND AS IT WERE INCOHERENT ANXIETY
3638-758-0028 FALLING ON HIS KNEES HE PRESSED HIS FOREHEAD TO THE STONE FLOOR AND LAY SO FOR A LONG WHILE AT LAST CAME THE FUNERAL SERVICE ITSELF AND CANDLES WERE DISTRIBUTED THE DISTRACTED FATHER BEGAN FUSSING ABOUT AGAIN
3638-758-0029 BUT THE TOUCHING AND IMPRESSIVE FUNERAL PRAYERS MOVED AND ROUSED HIS SOUL HE SEEMED SUDDENLY TO SHRINK TOGETHER AND BROKE INTO RAPID SHORT SOBS WHICH HE TRIED AT FIRST TO SMOTHER BUT AT LAST HE SOBBED ALOUD WHEN THEY BEGAN TAKING LEAVE OF THE DEAD AND CLOSING THE COFFIN
3638-758-0030 AND BEGAN GREEDILY AND PERSISTENTLY KISSING HIS DEAD BOY ON THE LIPS AT LAST THEY SUCCEEDED IN PERSUADING HIM TO COME AWAY FROM THE STEP BUT SUDDENLY HE IMPULSIVELY STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND SNATCHED A FEW FLOWERS FROM THE COFFIN
3638-758-0031 HE LOOKED AT THEM AND A NEW IDEA SEEMED TO DAWN UPON HIM SO THAT HE APPARENTLY FORGOT HIS GRIEF FOR A MINUTE GRADUALLY HE SEEMED TO SINK INTO BROODING AND DID NOT RESIST WHEN THE COFFIN WAS LIFTED UP AND CARRIED TO THE GRAVE
3638-758-0032 IT WAS AN EXPENSIVE ONE IN THE CHURCHYARD CLOSE TO THE CHURCH KATERINA IVANOVNA HAD PAID FOR IT AFTER THE CUSTOMARY RITES THE GRAVE DIGGERS LOWERED THE COFFIN SNEGIRYOV WITH HIS FLOWERS IN HIS HANDS BENT DOWN SO LOW OVER THE OPEN GRAVE
3638-758-0033 THAT THE BOYS CAUGHT HOLD OF HIS COAT IN ALARM AND PULLED HIM BACK HE DID NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND FULLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING WHEN THEY BEGAN FILLING UP THE GRAVE HE SUDDENLY POINTED ANXIOUSLY AT THE FALLING EARTH AND BEGAN TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING BUT NO ONE COULD MAKE OUT WHAT HE MEANT AND HE STOPPED SUDDENLY
3638-758-0034 THEN HE WAS REMINDED THAT HE MUST CRUMBLE THE BREAD AND HE WAS AWFULLY EXCITED SNATCHED UP THE BREAD AND BEGAN PULLING IT TO PIECES AND FLINGING THE MORSELS ON THE GRAVE COME FLY DOWN BIRDS FLY DOWN SPARROWS HE MUTTERED ANXIOUSLY
3638-758-0035 ONE OF THE BOYS OBSERVED THAT IT WAS AWKWARD FOR HIM TO CRUMBLE THE BREAD WITH THE FLOWERS IN HIS HANDS AND SUGGESTED HE SHOULD GIVE THEM TO SOME ONE TO HOLD FOR A TIME BUT HE WOULD NOT DO THIS AND SEEMED INDEED SUDDENLY ALARMED FOR HIS FLOWERS AS THOUGH THEY WANTED TO TAKE THEM FROM HIM ALTOGETHER
3638-758-0036 AND AFTER LOOKING AT THE GRAVE AND AS IT WERE SATISFYING HIMSELF THAT EVERYTHING HAD BEEN DONE AND THE BREAD HAD BEEN CRUMBLED HE SUDDENLY TO THE SURPRISE OF EVERY ONE TURNED QUITE COMPOSEDLY EVEN AND MADE HIS WAY HOMEWARDS BUT HIS STEPS BECAME MORE AND MORE HURRIED
3638-758-0037 HE ALMOST RAN THE BOYS AND ALYOSHA KEPT UP WITH HIM THE FLOWERS ARE FOR MAMMA THE FLOWERS ARE FOR MAMMA I WAS UNKIND TO MAMMA HE BEGAN EXCLAIMING SUDDENLY SOME ONE CALLED TO HIM TO PUT ON HIS HAT AS IT WAS COLD
