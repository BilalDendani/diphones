4930-20046-0036 CHARMING LITTLE CANARY I HAVE SPENT THE FORENOON WITH HER AT THE PIANO I LIKE HER PLAYING WHEN SHE DOES NOT ATTEMPT MY FAVORITE TUNES IT MUST BE CONFESSED SHE IS APT TO VARY SOMEWHAT
4930-20046-0037 IT AS THAT OF A CANARY SWEET AND LIQUID AND CLEAR AND SUSTAINED BUT ALL ALIKE HER THROAT IS A FINE INSTRUMENT I SHALL TEACH HER TO USE IT WITH MORE EXPRESSION AND FEELING
4930-20046-0038 EVENING I AM BOOKED FOR A HORSEBACK RIDE WITH LITTLE HANDSOME TO MORROW MORNING HOW DID SHE MAKE ME OFFER I DID NOT MEAN TO ALL COUNTRY GIRLS RIDE I BELIEVE
4930-20046-0039 I OFTEN SEE MISS ETTY CANTERING THROUGH THE SHADY LANES ALL BY HERSELF I SAW THE BARS DOWN AT THE END OF THE TRACK THROUGH THE WOOD ONE DAY I IMMEDIATELY CONCLUDED THAT LITTLE UGLY HAD PACED OFF THAT WAY THAT I NEED NOT SEE HER FROM MY WINDOW
4930-20046-0040 I COME FORWARD AS SHE COMES NEAR ON THAT RAT LIKE PONY OF HERS WHO HOLDS HIS HEAD DOWN AS IF SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING LOST IN THE ROAD I STAND IN DOUBT WHETHER TO LAUGH AT HER PREDICAMENT
4930-20046-0041 OR ADVANCE IN A GENTLEMANLY MANNER TO REMOVE THE OBSTACLE I HAD PUT IN HER WAY
4930-20046-0042 NOW THIS INDEPENDENT YOUNG LADY SHALL BE AT LIBERTY TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF WITH NO OFFICIOUS INTERFERENCE OF MINE

4930-20046-0044 TANGLE HER FOOT IN THE STIRRUP OR RIDING SKIRT FAINT FALL BREAK HER NECK O HORRORS WILL NOT THE DEAR OLD AUNT TABITHA FORBID HER GOING WHAT A WELL PROPORTIONED AND LADYLIKE FIGURE IT WAS
4930-20046-0045 NOW I THINK OF IT HOW GRACEFULLY SHE SAT UPON HER FLYING DOBBIN
4930-20046-0046 IF AUNT TABITHA WANTS ANY LITTLE ATTENTION A NEEDLE THREADED OR A DROPPED STITCH TAKEN UP MISS ETTY QUIETLY COMES TO HER AID IT IS SO ENTIRELY A MATTER OF COURSE
4930-20046-0047 THE OLD LADY ONLY SMILES BUT ANY SERVICE FROM FLORA CALLS FORTH AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT IT BEING A PARTICULAR EFFORT OF GOOD NATURE AND GENERALLY THE FRUIT OF A DIRECT APPEAL MISS ETTY TALKS MORE THAN SHE DID TOO
4930-20046-0048 WHILE I AM TALKING NONSENSE WITH LITTLE HANDSOME
4930-20046-0049 HER UTTERANCE HAVING A PECULIAR DISTINCTNESS AND THE LOWEST TONES BEING FINE AND CLEAR LIKE THOSE OF A GOOD SINGER ON A
4930-20046-0050 WAS SHE BORN AND BRED IN RATBOROUGH I WONDER SHE NEVER SPEAKS WHILE WE ARE SINGING DOES SHE LIKE MUSIC THEN
4930-20046-0051 SUCH A QUESTION AND THAT IS ALL I ELICITED MUSIC AGAIN THE FORENOON OCCUPATION MISS FLORA DOES NOT LIKE BEING CRITICIZED I FIND
4930-20046-0052 ONE MUST NOT PRESUME TO SET HER RIGHT IN THE SMALLEST PARTICULAR SINGERS ARE PROVERBIALLY IRRITABLE
4930-20046-0053 CROSS OR UNREASONABLE I HATE TO BE CORRECTED BUT I HATE MORE TO BE INCORRECT I COULD GIVE CANARY A HINT OR TWO NOW AND THEN THAT WOULD BE SERVICEABLE IF SHE WOULD PERMIT IT
4930-20046-0054 I HAVE NO RIGHT HOWEVER TO TAKE IT UPON ME TO INSTRUCT HER AND IT PUTS HER IN A PET
4930-20046-0055 I AM HURT THAT I MIGHT NOT TAKE SO TRIFLING A LIBERTY IN BEHALF OF MY FAVORITE SONG I'LL WALK OFF AS OFTEN AS SHE SINGS IT CAN HER TEMPER BE PERFECTLY GOOD AND YET ONE COULD NOT EXPECT I OUGHT NOT TO BE SURPRISED
4930-20046-0056 YET I CAN'T HELP THINKING SUPPOSE JUST SUPPOSE I HAD A RIGHT TO FIND FAULT SUPPOSE I WERE A NEAR FRIEND WOULD SHE BEAR IT THEN SUPPOSING SHE WERE MY COMPANION FOR LIFE HUMPH
4930-20046-0057 THAT STARTLES ONE WAS I NEAR THINKING OF IT IN EARNEST SHE IS BEAUTIFUL I SHOULD BE PROUD OF HER ABROAD BUT AT HOME AT HOME WHERE THERE SHOULD
4930-20046-0058 BE CONFIDENCE WOULD THERE NOT BE CONSTRAINT MUST NO IMPROVEMENT EVER BE SUGGESTED BECAUSE IT IMPLIES IMPERFECTION I HOPE NONE OF MY FRIENDS WILL EVER BE ON SUCH TERMS WITH ME
4930-20046-0059 IF I AM TOUCHY LIKE A NETTLE MAY THEY GRASP ME HARD AND FEAR ME NOT SEPTEMBER
4930-20046-0060 ITS FACE IS LIKE A HUMAN FACE FULL OF VARYING EXPRESSIONS A SLIGHT HAZE MADE IT SO BEAUTIFUL JUST BEFORE SUNSET I TOOK MY CHAIR AND PUT IT OUT OF THE WINDOW UPON THE GRASS THEN FOLLOWED IT
4930-20046-0061 AND SAT WITH IT TIPPED BACK AGAINST THE HOUSE CLOSE BY THE WINDOW OF ONE OF THOSE MYSTERIOUS ROOMS WHERE MISS ETTY IMMURES HERSELF I HEARD THE CANARY SAY IN A SCOLDING TONE I SHOULD THINK YOU MIGHT OBLIGE ME
4930-20046-0062 IT IS SUCH A TRIFLE TO DO IT IS NOT WORTH REFUSING
4930-20046-0063 I WAS WHOLLY OBLIVIOUS OF MYSELF OR I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN MYSELF AWAY AS IN HONOR BOUND WON'T YOU NOW ETTY I'LL ONLY ASK FOR ONE OF OUR OLD DUETS JUST ONE NO FLORA
4930-20046-0064 SAID LITTLE UGLY COLDLY ENOUGH WHY NOT NO ANSWER TO BE SURE HE MIGHT HEAR HE WOULD FIND OUT THAT YOU ARE MUSICAL WHAT OF THAT
4930-20046-0065 WHERE IS THE USE OF BEING ABLE TO SING TO SING ONLY WHEN THERE'S NOBODY TO LISTEN I SING ONLY TO FRIENDS I CANNOT SING I HAVE NEVER SUNG TO PERSONS IN WHOM I HAVE NO CONFIDENCE AFRAID
4930-20046-0066 YOU NEVER WILL SILENCE AGAIN FLORA TUNED UP AND OF ALL TUNES SHE MUST NEEDS HUM MY SONG
4930-20046-0067 WITH ONE FOOT ADVANCED FLORA YOU SHOULD SHARP THAT THIRD NOTE IN THE LAST LINE FLORA MURDERED IT AGAIN WITH THE MOST ATROCIOUS COLD BLOODED CRUELTY
4930-20046-0068 I ALMOST MOCKED THE SOUND ALOUD IN MY PASSION I DO NOT TELL YOU TO VEX YOU ONLY I SAW THAT MISTER RATCLIFFE YOU NEED NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT HIS OPINION
4930-20046-0069 IF I TOLD YOU OF A MISTAKE BUT I SUPPOSED YOU WOULD RECTIFY IT AND I SHOULD HAVE DONE YOU A KINDNESS EVEN AGAINST YOUR WILL
4930-20046-0070 IF YOU CAN INDEED I CANNOT ETTY FOR YOU ARE MY VERY BEST FRIEND BUT YOU ARE A HORRID TRUTH TELLING FORMIDABLE BODY WHY NOT LET ME SING ON MY OWN WAY
4930-20046-0071 I DON'T THANK YOU A BIT I HAD RATHER SING IT WRONG THAN BE CORRECTED IT HURTS MY PRIDE I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD TAKE MY MUSIC AS THEY FIND IT IF
4930-20046-0072 IT DOES NOT PLEASE THEM THEY ARE NOT OBLIGED TO ASK ME TO SING ONE NOTE WRONG CAN SURELY BE PUT UP WITH IF THE REST IS WORTH HEARING I SHALL CONTINUE TO SING IT AS I HAVE DONE I THINK NO
4930-20046-0073 PLEASE DON'T IF I WILL MEND IT WHEN I THINK OF IT WILL YOU SING A DUET YES THOUGH IT WILL COST ME MORE THAN YOU KNOW POH AND FLORA SANG THE SONG
4930-20046-0074 WITHOUT ACCOMPANIMENT THE DESIRED SHARP RUNG UPON MY EARS AND SET MY NERVES AT REST BRAVO ENCORE I CRIED BENEATH THE WINDOW AND WAS PELTED
4930-20046-0075 WITH PEACH STONES I WONDER
