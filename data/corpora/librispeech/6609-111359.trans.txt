6609-111359-0000 WE TRAVELLED IN THE PRINT OF OLDEN WARS YET ALL THE LAND WAS GREEN AND LOVE WE FOUND AND PEACE WHERE FIRE AND WAR HAD BEEN THEY PASS AND SMILE THE CHILDREN OF THE SWORD
6609-111359-0001 NO MORE THE SWORD THEY WIELD AND O HOW DEEP THE CORN ALONG THE BATTLEFIELD W P BANNATYNE ACROSS THE LOZERE
6609-111359-0002 THE TRACK THAT I HAD FOLLOWED IN THE EVENING SOON DIED OUT AND I CONTINUED TO FOLLOW OVER A BALD TURF ASCENT A ROW OF STONE PILLARS SUCH AS HAD CONDUCTED ME ACROSS THE GOULET IT WAS ALREADY WARM
6609-111359-0003 I TIED MY JACKET ON THE PACK AND WALKED IN MY KNITTED WAISTCOAT MODESTINE HERSELF WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS AND BROKE OF HER OWN ACCORD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY EXPERIENCE INTO A JOLTING TROT THAT SENT THE OATS SWASHING IN THE POCKET OF MY COAT
6609-111359-0004 SCARCE A TREE SCARCE A HOUSE APPEARED UPON THE FIELDS OF WILD HILL THAT RAN NORTH EAST AND WEST ALL BLUE AND GOLD IN THE HAZE AND SUNLIGHT OF THE MORNING A MULTITUDE OF LITTLE BIRDS KEPT SWEEPING AND TWITTERING ABOUT MY PATH
6609-111359-0005 THEY PERCHED ON THE STONE PILLARS THEY PECKED AND STRUTTED ON THE TURF AND I SAW THEM CIRCLE IN VOLLEYS IN THE BLUE AIR AND SHOW FROM TIME TO TIME TRANSLUCENT FLICKERING WINGS BETWEEN THE SUN AND ME
6609-111359-0006 ALMOST FROM THE FIRST MOMENT OF MY MARCH A FAINT LARGE NOISE LIKE A DISTANT SURF HAD FILLED MY EARS SOMETIMES I WAS TEMPTED TO THINK IT THE VOICE OF A NEIGHBOURING WATERFALL
6609-111359-0007 AND SOMETIMES A SUBJECTIVE RESULT OF THE UTTER STILLNESS OF THE HILL BUT AS I CONTINUED TO ADVANCE THE NOISE INCREASED AND BECAME LIKE THE HISSING OF AN ENORMOUS TEA URN AND AT THE SAME TIME
6609-111359-0008 BREATHS OF COOL AIR BEGAN TO REACH ME FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE SUMMIT AT LENGTH I UNDERSTOOD IT WAS BLOWING STIFFLY FROM THE SOUTH UPON THE OTHER SLOPE OF THE LOZERE AND EVERY STEP THAT I TOOK I WAS DRAWING NEARER TO THE WIND
6609-111359-0009 ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN LONG DESIRED IT WAS QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY AT LAST THAT MY EYES ROSE ABOVE THE SUMMIT A STEP THAT SEEMED NO WAY MORE DECISIVE THAN MANY OTHER STEPS THAT HAD PRECEDED IT AND
6609-111359-0010 LIKE STOUT CORTEZ WHEN WITH EAGLE EYES HE STARED AT THE PACIFIC I TOOK POSSESSION IN MY OWN NAME OF A NEW QUARTER OF THE WORLD FOR BEHOLD INSTEAD OF THE GROSS TURF RAMPART I HAD BEEN MOUNTING FOR SO LONG
6609-111359-0011 A VIEW INTO THE HAZY AIR OF HEAVEN AND A LAND OF INTRICATE BLUE HILLS BELOW MY FEET THE LOZERE LIES NEARLY EAST AND WEST CUTTING GEVAUDAN INTO TWO UNEQUAL PARTS
6609-111359-0012 ITS HIGHEST POINT THIS PIC DE FINIELS ON WHICH I WAS THEN STANDING RISES UPWARDS OF FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE SEA AND IN CLEAR WEATHER COMMANDS A VIEW OVER ALL LOWER LANGUEDOC TO THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA
6609-111359-0013 I HAVE SPOKEN WITH PEOPLE WHO EITHER PRETENDED OR BELIEVED THAT THEY HAD SEEN FROM THE PIC DE FINIELS WHITE SHIPS SAILING BY MONTPELLIER AND CETTE BEHIND WAS THE UPLAND NORTHERN COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH MY WAY HAD LAIN
6609-111359-0014 PEOPLED BY A DULL RACE WITHOUT WOOD WITHOUT MUCH GRANDEUR OF HILL FORM AND FAMOUS IN THE PAST FOR LITTLE BESIDES WOLVES BUT IN FRONT OF ME HALF VEILED IN SUNNY HAZE
6609-111359-0015 RICH PICTURESQUE ILLUSTRIOUS FOR STIRRING EVENTS SPEAKING LARGELY I WAS IN THE CEVENNES AT MONASTIER AND DURING ALL MY JOURNEY BUT THERE IS A STRICT AND LOCAL SENSE IN WHICH ONLY THIS CONFUSED AND SHAGGY COUNTRY AT MY FEET HAS ANY TITLE TO THE NAME
6609-111359-0016 AND IN THIS SENSE THE PEASANTRY EMPLOY THE WORD THESE ARE THE CEVENNES WITH AN EMPHASIS THE CEVENNES OF THE CEVENNES IN THAT UNDECIPHERABLE LABYRINTH OF HILLS
6609-111359-0017 A WAR OF BANDITS A WAR OF WILD BEASTS RAGED FOR TWO YEARS BETWEEN THE GRAND MONARCH WITH ALL HIS TROOPS AND MARSHALS ON THE ONE HAND AND A FEW THOUSAND PROTESTANT MOUNTAINEERS UPON THE OTHER
6609-111359-0018 A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY YEARS AGO THE CAMISARDS HELD A STATION EVEN ON THE LOZERE WHERE I STOOD THEY HAD AN ORGANIZATION ARSENALS A MILITARY AND RELIGIOUS HIERARCHY THEIR AFFAIRS WERE THE DISCOURSE OF EVERY COFFEE HOUSE IN LONDON
6609-111359-0019 ENGLAND SENT FLEETS IN THEIR SUPPORT THEIR LEADERS PROPHESIED AND MURDERED WITH COLOURS AND DRUMS AND THE SINGING OF OLD FRENCH PSALMS THEIR BANDS SOMETIMES AFFRONTED DAYLIGHT MARCHED BEFORE WALLED CITIES
6609-111359-0020 AND DISPERSED THE GENERALS OF THE KING AND SOMETIMES AT NIGHT OR IN MASQUERADE POSSESSED THEMSELVES OF STRONG CASTLES AND AVENGED TREACHERY UPON THEIR ALLIES AND CRUELTY UPON THEIR FOES THERE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY YEARS AGO WAS THE CHIVALROUS ROLAND
6609-111359-0021 GRAVE SILENT IMPERIOUS POCK MARKED EX DRAGOON WHOM A LADY FOLLOWED IN HIS WANDERINGS OUT OF LOVE THERE WAS CAVALIER A BAKER'S APPRENTICE WITH A GENIUS FOR WAR
6609-111359-0022 THERE AGAIN WAS CASTANET A PARTISAN LEADER IN A VOLUMINOUS PERUKE AND WITH A TASTE FOR CONTROVERSIAL DIVINITY STRANGE GENERALS WHO MOVED APART TO TAKE COUNSEL WITH THE GOD OF HOSTS AND FLED OR OFFERED BATTLE SET SENTINELS
6609-111359-0023 OR SLEPT IN AN UNGUARDED CAMP AS THE SPIRIT WHISPERED TO THEIR HEARTS AND THERE TO FOLLOW THESE AND OTHER LEADERS WAS THE RANK AND FILE OF PROPHETS AND DISCIPLES BOLD PATIENT INDEFATIGABLE HARDY TO RUN UPON THE MOUNTAINS
6609-111359-0024 CHEERING THEIR ROUGH LIFE WITH PSALMS EAGER TO FIGHT EAGER TO PRAY LISTENING DEVOUTLY TO THE ORACLES OF BRAIN SICK CHILDREN AND MYSTICALLY PUTTING A GRAIN OF WHEAT AMONG THE PEWTER BALLS WITH WHICH THEY CHARGED THEIR MUSKETS
6609-111359-0025 THE NAPOLEON BONAPARTE OF WOLVES BUT NOW I WAS TO GO DOWN INTO THE SCENE OF A ROMANTIC CHAPTER OR BETTER A ROMANTIC FOOTNOTE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS LEFT OF ALL THIS BYGONE DUST AND HEROISM
6609-111359-0026 I WAS TOLD THAT PROTESTANTISM STILL SURVIVED IN THIS HEAD SEAT OF PROTESTANT RESISTANCE SO MUCH THE PRIEST HIMSELF HAD TOLD ME IN THE MONASTERY PARLOUR BUT I HAD YET TO LEARN IF IT WERE A BARE SURVIVAL OR A LIVELY AND GENEROUS TRADITION
6609-111359-0027 AGAIN IF IN THE NORTHERN CEVENNES THE PEOPLE ARE NARROW IN RELIGIOUS JUDGMENTS AND MORE FILLED WITH ZEAL THAN CHARITY WHAT WAS I TO LOOK FOR IN THIS LAND OF PERSECUTION AND REPRISAL
6609-111359-0028 SKULKED FOR EACH OTHER'S LIVES AMONG THE MOUNTAINS JUST ON THE BROW OF THE HILL WHERE I PAUSED TO LOOK BEFORE ME THE SERIES OF STONE PILLARS CAME ABRUPTLY TO AN END AND ONLY A LITTLE BELOW
6609-111359-0029 A SORT OF TRACK APPEARED AND BEGAN TO GO DOWN A BREAK NECK SLOPE TURNING LIKE A CORKSCREW AS IT WENT IT LED INTO A VALLEY BETWEEN FALLING HILLS STUBBLY WITH ROCKS LIKE A REAPED FIELD OF CORN AND FLOORED FARTHER DOWN WITH GREEN MEADOWS
6609-111359-0030 I FOLLOWED THE TRACK WITH PRECIPITATION THE STEEPNESS OF THE SLOPE THE CONTINUAL AGILE TURNING OF THE LINE OF THE DESCENT AND THE OLD UNWEARIED HOPE OF FINDING SOMETHING NEW IN A NEW COUNTRY ALL CONSPIRED TO LEND ME WINGS
6609-111359-0031 YET A LITTLE LOWER AND A STREAM BEGAN COLLECTING ITSELF TOGETHER OUT OF MANY FOUNTAINS AND SOON MAKING A GLAD NOISE AMONG THE HILLS SOMETIMES IT WOULD CROSS THE TRACK IN A BIT OF WATERFALL WITH A POOL IN WHICH MODESTINE REFRESHED HER FEET
6609-111359-0032 THE WHOLE DESCENT IS LIKE A DREAM TO ME SO RAPIDLY WAS IT ACCOMPLISHED I HAD SCARCELY LEFT THE SUMMIT ERE THE VALLEY HAD CLOSED ROUND MY PATH AND THE SUN BEAT UPON ME WALKING IN A STAGNANT LOWLAND ATMOSPHERE
6609-111359-0033 THE TRACK BECAME A ROAD AND WENT UP AND DOWN IN EASY UNDULATIONS I PASSED CABIN AFTER CABIN BUT ALL SEEMED DESERTED AND I SAW NOT A HUMAN CREATURE NOR HEARD ANY SOUND EXCEPT THAT OF THE STREAM
6609-111359-0034 I WAS HOWEVER IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY FROM THE DAY BEFORE THE STONY SKELETON OF THE WORLD WAS HERE VIGOROUSLY DISPLAYED TO SUN AND AIR THE SLOPES WERE STEEP AND CHANGEFUL OAK TREES CLUNG ALONG THE HILLS
6609-111359-0035 WELL GROWN WEALTHY IN LEAF AND TOUCHED BY THE AUTUMN WITH STRONG AND LUMINOUS COLOURS HERE AND THERE ANOTHER STREAM WOULD FALL IN FROM THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT DOWN A GORGE OF SNOW WHITE AND TUMULTUARY BOULDERS
6609-111359-0036 THE RIVER IN THE BOTTOM FOR IT WAS RAPIDLY GROWING A RIVER COLLECTING ON ALL HANDS AS IT TROTTED ON ITS WAY HERE FOAMED A WHILE IN DESPERATE RAPIDS AND THERE LAY IN POOLS OF THE MOST ENCHANTING SEA GREEN SHOT WITH WATERY BROWNS
6609-111359-0037 AS FAR AS I HAVE GONE I HAVE NEVER SEEN A RIVER OF SO CHANGEFUL AND DELICATE A HUE CRYSTAL WAS NOT MORE CLEAR THE MEADOWS WERE NOT BY HALF SO GREEN AND AT EVERY POOL I SAW I FELT A THRILL OF LONGING TO BE OUT OF THESE HOT
6609-111359-0038 DUSTY AND MATERIAL GARMENTS AND BATHE MY NAKED BODY IN THE MOUNTAIN AIR AND WATER ALL THE TIME AS I WENT ON I NEVER FORGOT IT WAS THE SABBATH THE STILLNESS WAS A PERPETUAL REMINDER
6609-111359-0039 AND I HEARD IN SPIRIT THE CHURCH BELLS CLAMOURING ALL OVER EUROPE AND THE PSALMS OF A THOUSAND CHURCHES AT LENGTH A HUMAN SOUND STRUCK UPON MY EAR A CRY STRANGELY MODULATED BETWEEN PATHOS AND DERISION
6609-111359-0040 AND LOOKING ACROSS THE VALLEY I SAW A LITTLE URCHIN SITTING IN A MEADOW WITH HIS HANDS ABOUT HIS KNEES AND DWARFED TO ALMOST COMICAL SMALLNESS BY THE DISTANCE BUT THE ROGUE HAD PICKED ME OUT AS I WENT DOWN THE ROAD
6609-111359-0041 FROM OAK WOOD ON TO OAK WOOD DRIVING MODESTINE AND HE MADE ME THE COMPLIMENTS OF THE NEW COUNTRY IN THIS TREMULOUS HIGH PITCHED SALUTATION AND AS ALL NOISES ARE LOVELY AND NATURAL AT A SUFFICIENT DISTANCE THIS ALSO
6609-111359-0042 COMING THROUGH SO MUCH CLEAN HILL AIR AND CROSSING ALL THE GREEN VALLEY SOUNDED PLEASANT TO MY EAR AND SEEMED A THING RUSTIC LIKE THE OAKS OR THE RIVER A LITTLE AFTER THE STREAM THAT I WAS FOLLOWING FELL INTO THE TARN
