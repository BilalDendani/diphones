7134-67200-0000 TO WHICH IN HIS WILDER STATE HE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A STRANGER HIS VOCABULARY IF IT MAY BE SO CALLED THEN INCREASES IN ORDER TO EXPRESS HIS ENLARGED AND VARYING EMOTIONS HE ANTICIPATES REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS
7134-67200-0001 AND LEARNS TO SOLICIT THE FORMER AND DEPRECATE THE LATTER HE BOUNDS EXULTINGLY FORTH TO ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER IN HIS WALKS RIDES AND SPORTS OF THE FIELD HE ACTS AS THE FAITHFUL GUARDIAN OF HIS PROPERTY HE IS HIS FIRE SIDE COMPANION
7134-67200-0002 EVIDENTLY DISCERNS DAYS OF HOUSEHOLD MIRTH OR GRIEF AND DEPORTS HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY HENCE HIS ENERGIES AND HIS SENSIBILITIES ARE ALL EXPANDED AND WHAT HE FEELS HE SEEKS TO TELL IN VARIOUS ACCENTS AND IN DIFFERENT WAYS
7134-67200-0003 I HAVE SEEN A DOG PICK UP A STICK AND BRING IT IN HIS MOUTH TO HIS MASTER LOOKING AT THE WATER FIRST AND THEN AT HIS MASTER EVIDENTLY THAT THE STICK MIGHT BE THROWN INTO IT THAT HE MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SWIMMING AFTER IT
7134-67200-0004 IN MY YOUNGER DAYS I WAS IN THE HABIT OF TEAZING A FAVOURITE DOG BY TWITCHING HIS NOSE AND PRETENDING TO PULL HIS EARS HE WOULD SNAP GENTLY AT ME
7134-67200-0005 AS IF GRATEFUL FOR WHAT HE WAS DOING THOSE WHO ARE IN THE HABIT OF HAVING DOGS CONSTANTLY IN THE ROOM WITH THEM WILL HAVE PERCEIVED HOW ALIVE THEY ARE TO THE SLIGHTEST CHANGE IN THE COUNTENANCE OF THEIR MASTER HOW GENTLY THEY WILL TOUCH HIM WITH THEIR PAW WHEN HE IS EATING
7134-67200-0006 IN ORDER TO REMIND HIM OF THEIR OWN WANT OF FOOD AND HOW READILY THEY DISTINGUISH THE MOVEMENTS OF ANY INMATE OF THE HOUSE FROM THOSE OF A STRANGER
7134-67200-0007 THESE AND MANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MIGHT BE MENTIONED SHOW A MARKED DISTINCTION BETWEEN A DOMESTICATED DOG AND ONE THAT IS WILD OR WHO HAS LIVED WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE IN AN UNCIVILIZED STATE SUCH AS THE ESQUIMAUX
7134-67200-0008 THEY WILL BURY OR HIDE FOOD WHICH THEY ARE UNABLE TO CONSUME AT ONCE AND RETURN FOR IT BUT THE DOMESTIC DOG PERHAPS GIVES STRONGER PROOFS OF FORETHOUGHT AND I WILL GIVE AN INSTANCE OF IT
7134-67200-0009 A LARGE METAL POT TURNED ON ONE SIDE IN WHICH A GREAT QUANTITY OF PORRIDGE HAD BEEN BOILED
7134-67200-0010 I HAD A DOG WHO HAVING ONCE SCALDED HIS TONGUE ALWAYS AFTERWARDS WHEN I GAVE HIM HIS MILK AND WATER AT BREAKFAST PUT HIS PAW VERY CAUTIOUSLY INTO THE SAUCER TO SEE IF THE LIQUID WAS TOO HOT BEFORE HE WOULD TOUCH IT WITH HIS TONGUE
7134-67200-0011 WITHOUT OWNERS AMONGST THE NUMBER TWO MORE PARTICULARLY DISTINGUISHED THEMSELVES FOR THEIR ANIMOSITY TO CATS ONE DAY THEY WERE IN PURSUIT OF A CAT WHICH SEEING NO OTHER PLACE OF REFUGE NEAR MADE HER ESCAPE INTO A LONG EARTHEN WATER PIPE
7134-67200-0012 WHICH WAS LYING ON THE GROUND THESE TWO INSEPARABLE COMPANIONS WHO ALWAYS SUPPORTED EACH OTHER PURSUED THE CAT TO THE PIPE WHERE THEY WERE SEEN TO STOP AND APPARENTLY TO CONSULT EACH OTHER AS TO
7134-67200-0013 THE MEMORY OF DOGS IS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY AND ONLY EQUALLED BY THAT OF THE ELEPHANT MISTER SWAINSON IN HIS WORK ON THE INSTINCTS OF ANIMALS GIVES THE FOLLOWING PROOF OF THIS HE SAYS THAT
7134-67200-0014 BEING ALWAYS TOLD THAT HE MUST NOT FOLLOW HIS MASTER TO CHURCH ON SUNDAYS USED ON THOSE DAYS TO SET OFF LONG BEFORE THE SERVICE AND LIE CONCEALED UNDER THE HEDGE SO NEAR THE CHURCH THAT AT LENGTH THE POINT WAS YIELDED TO HIM
7134-67200-0015 MY LITTLE PARLOUR DOG NEVER OFFERS TO GO WITH ME ON A SUNDAY ALTHOUGH ON OTHER DAYS HE IS PERFECTLY WILD TO ACCOMPANY ME IN MY WALKS IN MY YOUNGER DAYS I HAD A FAVOURITE DOG WHICH ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED ME TO CHURCH MY MOTHER
7134-67200-0016 SEEING THAT HE ATTRACTED TOO MUCH OF MY ATTENTION ORDERED THE SERVANT TO SHUT HIM EVERY SUNDAY MORNING THIS WAS DONE ONCE BUT NEVER AFTERWARDS FOR HE CONCEALED HIMSELF EARLY EVERY SUNDAY MORNING AND I WAS SURE TO FIND HIM EITHER UNDER MY SEAT AT CHURCH OR ELSE
7134-67200-0017 AT THE CHURCH DOOR THAT DOGS CLEARLY DISTINGUISH THE RETURN OF SUNDAY CANNOT BE DOUBTED THE ALMOST INCREDIBLE PENETRATION AND EXPEDITION
7134-67200-0018 IN ESSEX A STILL MORE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE IS UPON RECORD OF THE LATE COLONEL HARDY WHO HAVING BEEN SENT FOR EXPRESS TO BATH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A FAVOURITE SPANIEL BITCH
7134-67200-0019 IN HIS CHAISE WHICH HE NEVER QUITTED TILL HIS ARRIVAL THERE AFTER REMAINING THERE FOUR DAYS HE ACCIDENTALLY LEFT HIS SPANIEL BEHIND HIM AND RETURNED TO HIS RESIDENCE AT SPRINGFIELD IN ESSEX WITH EQUAL EXPEDITION WHERE IN THREE DAYS AFTER
7134-67200-0020 HIS FAITHFUL AND STEADY ADHERENT ARRIVED ALSO NOTWITHSTANDING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THAT PLACE AND BATH IS ONE HUNDRED FORTY MILES AND SHE HAD TO EXPLORE HER WAY THROUGH LONDON TO WHICH SHE HAD NEVER BEEN EXCEPT IN HER PASSAGE TO BATH AND THEN WITHIN THE CONFINES OF A CLOSE CARRIAGE
7134-67200-0021 BUT HIS INTENTIONS WERE OF A MORE BENEVOLENT NATURE AFTER GUARDING THE ENTRANCE OF THE KENNEL FOR SOME TIME HE TROTTED DOWN THE YARD INTO THE STREET LOOKED ABOUT TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT AND SEEING THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR HE WENT BACK AGAIN
7134-67200-0022 HE SAYS THAT THE COOK IN THE HOUSE OF A FRIEND OF HIS A LADY ON WHOSE ACCURACY HE COULD RELY AND FROM WHOM HE HAD THE ANECDOTE MISSED A MARROW BONE
7134-67200-0023 SUSPICION FELL ON A WELL BEHAVED DOG A GREAT FAVOURITE AND UP TO THAT TIME DISTINGUISHED FOR HIS HONESTY HE WAS CHARGED WITH THE THEFT HE HUNG DOWN HIS TAIL AND FOR A DAY OR TWO WAS ALTERED IN HIS MANNER HAVING BECOME SHY SULLEN
7134-67200-0024 AND SHEEPISH TO USE THESE EXPRESSIONS FOR WANT OF BETTER IN THIS MOOD HE CONTINUED TILL TO THE AMUSEMENT OF THE COOK HE BROUGHT BACK THE BONE AND LAID IT AT HER FEET THEN WITH THE RESTORATION OF HER STOLEN PROPERTY HE RESUMED HIS CHEERFUL MANNER
7134-67200-0025 HOW CAN WE INTERPRET THIS CONDUCT OF THE DOG BETTER THAN BY SUPPOSING THAT HE WAS AWARE HE HAD DONE AMISS AND THAT THE EVIL DOING PREYED ON HIM TILL HE HAD MADE RESTITUTION WAS NOT THIS A KIND OF MORAL SENSE
7134-67200-0026 BY ACTING IN THIS MANNER HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF HIS MASTER A DOG HAS BEEN KNOWN TO CONVEY FOOD TO ANOTHER OF HIS SPECIES WHO WAS TIED UP AND PINING FOR WANT OF IT
7134-67200-0027 A DOG HAS FREQUENTLY BEEN SEEN TO PLUNGE VOLUNTARILY INTO A RAPID STREAM TO RESCUE ANOTHER THAT WAS IN DANGER OF DROWNING
7134-67200-0028 HE HAS DEFENDED HELPLESS CURS FROM THE ATTACKS OF OTHER DOGS AND LEARNS TO APPORTION PUNISHMENT ACCORDING TO THE PROVOCATION RECEIVED FREQUENTLY DISDAINING TO EXERCISE HIS POWER AND STRENGTH ON A WEAKER ADVERSARY
7134-67200-0029 REPEATED PROVOCATION WILL HOWEVER EXCITE AND REVENGE FOR INSTANCE A NEWFOUNDLAND DOG WAS QUIETLY EATING HIS MESS OF BROTH AND BROKEN SCRAPS WHILE SO EMPLOYED A TURKEY ENDEAVOURED TO SHARE THE MEAL WITH HIM
7134-67200-0030 THE DOG GROWLED AND DISPLAYED HIS TEETH THE INTRUDER RETIRED FOR A MOMENT BUT QUICKLY RETURNED TO THE CHARGE AND WAS AGAIN WARNED OFF WITH A LIKE RESULT AFTER THREE OR FOUR ATTEMPTS OF THE SAME KIND THE DOG BECAME PROVOKED
7134-67200-0031 GAVE A SUDDEN FEROCIOUS GROWL BIT OFF THE DELINQUENT'S HEAD AND THEN QUIETLY FINISHED HIS MEAL WITHOUT BESTOWING ANY FURTHER ATTENTION ON HIS VICTIM
7134-67200-0032 THE CELEBRATED LEIBNITZ RELATED TO THE FRENCH ACADEMY AN ACCOUNT OF A DOG HE HAD SEEN WHICH WAS TAUGHT TO SPEAK AND COULD CALL IN AN INTELLIGIBLE MANNER FOR TEA COFFEE CHOCOLATE
7134-67200-0033 A LITTLE BOY THE PEASANT'S SON IMAGINED THAT HE PERCEIVED IN THE DOG'S VOICE AN INDISTINCT RESEMBLANCE TO CERTAIN WORDS AND WAS THEREFORE DETERMINED TO TEACH HIM TO SPEAK DISTINCTLY
7134-67200-0034 FOR THIS PURPOSE HE SPARED NEITHER TIME NOR PAINS WITH HIS PUPIL WHO WAS ABOUT THREE YEARS OLD WHEN HIS LEARNED EDUCATION COMMENCED AND AT LENGTH HE MADE SUCH PROGRESS IN LANGUAGE AS TO BE ABLE TO ARTICULATE NO LESS THAN THIRTY WORDS
7134-67200-0035 IT APPEARS HOWEVER THAT HE WAS SOMEWHAT OF A TRUANT AND DID NOT VERY WILLINGLY EXERT HIS TALENTS BEING RATHER PRESSED INTO THE SERVICE OF LITERATURE AND IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THE WORDS SHOULD BE FIRST PRONOUNCED TO HIM EACH TIME BEFORE HE SPOKE
