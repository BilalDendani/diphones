937-148985-0005 I'VE TRAMPED UP AND DOWN THE DECK SO MUCH I SHALL BE BAREFOOTED IF WE DON'T ARRIVE SOON LAUGHED MARY THE DAUGHTER SHOWING TWO SHABBY LITTLE BOOTS AS SHE GLANCED UP AT THE COMPANION OF THESE TRAMPS REMEMBERING GRATEFULLY HOW PLEASANT HE HAD MADE THEM
937-148985-0006 DON'T THINK THERE ARE ANY SMALL ENOUGH IN CHINA ANSWERED EMIL WITH A SAILOR'S READY GALLANTRY PRIVATELY RESOLVING TO HUNT UP THE HANDSOMEST SHOES HE COULD FIND THE MOMENT HE LANDED

937-148985-0008 IS THIS LIKELY TO BE A GALE THINK YE ADDED MISSUS HARDY WITH AN ANXIOUS GLANCE AT THE WEST WHERE THE SUN WAS SETTING REDLY ONLY A CAPFUL OF WIND MA'AM JUST ENOUGH TO SEND US ALONG LIVELY ANSWERED EMIL
937-148985-0009 WITH A COMPREHENSIVE GLANCE ALOFT AND ALOW PLEASE SING MISTER HOFFMANN IT'S SO PLEASANT TO HAVE MUSIC AT THIS TIME WE SHALL MISS IT VERY MUCH WHEN WE GET ASHORE SAID MARY
937-148985-0010 GIVE ME FRESHENING BREEZE MY BOYS A WHITE AND SWELLING SAIL A SHIP THAT CUTS THE DASHING WAVES AND WEATHERS EVERY GALE WHAT LIFE IS LIKE A SAILOR'S LIFE SO FREE SO BOLD SO BRAVE
937-148985-0011 HIS HOME THE OCEAN'S WIDE EXPANSE A CORAL BED HIS GRAVE JUST AS THE LAST NOTES OF THE CLEAR STRONG VOICE DIED AWAY MISSUS HARDY SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED WHAT'S THAT
937-148985-0012 EMIL'S QUICK EYE SAW AT ONCE THE LITTLE PUFF OF SMOKE COMING UP A HATCHWAY WHERE NO SMOKE SHOULD BE AND HIS HEART SEEMED TO STAND STILL FOR AN INSTANT AS THE DREAD WORD FIRE FLASHED THROUGH HIS MIND THEN HE WAS QUITE STEADY
937-148985-0013 FIRE IN THE HOLD SIR DON'T FRIGHTEN THE WOMEN WAS CAPTAIN HARDY'S FIRST ORDER THEN BOTH BE STIRRED THEMSELVES TO DISCOVER HOW STRONG THE TREACHEROUS ENEMY WAS AND TO ROUT IT IF POSSIBLE THE BRENDA'S CARGO WAS A VERY COMBUSTIBLE ONE
937-148985-0014 AND IN SPITE OF THE STREAMS OF WATER POURED INTO THE HOLD IT WAS SOON EVIDENT THAT THE SHIP WAS DOOMED SMOKE BEGAN TO OOZE UP BETWEEN THE PLANKS EVERYWHERE AND THE RISING GALE SOON FANNED THE SMOULDERING FIRE TO FLAMES THAT BEGAN TO BREAK OUT HERE AND THERE
937-148985-0015 TELLING THE DREADFUL TRUTH TOO PLAINLY FOR ANYONE TO HIDE MISSUS HARDY AND MARY BORE THE SHOCK BRAVELY WHEN TOLD TO BE READY TO QUIT THE SHIP AT A MINUTE'S NOTICE THE BOATS WERE HASTILY PREPARED
937-148985-0016 AND THE MEN WORKED WITH A WILL TO BATTEN DOWN EVERY LOOPHOLE WHENCE THE FIRE MIGHT ESCAPE SOON THE POOR BRENDA WAS A FLOATING FURNACE AND THE ORDER TO TAKE TO THE BOATS CAME FOR ALL THE WOMEN FIRST OF COURSE AND IT WAS FORTUNATE THAT
937-148985-0017 BEING A MERCHANTMAN THERE WERE NO MORE PASSENGERS ON BOARD SO THERE WAS NO PANIC AND ONE AFTER THE OTHER THE BOATS PUSHED OFF THAT IN WHICH THE WOMEN WERE LINGERED NEAR FOR THE BRAVE CAPTAIN WOULD BE THE LAST TO LEAVE HIS SHIP
937-148985-0018 EMIL STAYED BY HIM TILL ORDERED AWAY AND RELUCTANTLY OBEYED BUT IT WAS WELL FOR HIM HE WENT
937-148985-0019 ROCKING FAR BELOW HALF HIDDEN BY A CLOUD OF SMOKE A MAST UNDERMINED BY THE FIRE NOW RAGING IN THE BOWELS OF THE SHIP FELL WITH A CRASH KNOCKING CAPTAIN HARDY OVERBOARD
937-148985-0020 THE BOAT SOON REACHED HIM AS HE FLOATED OUT FROM THE WRECK AND EMIL SPRUNG INTO THE SEA TO RESCUE HIM FOR HE WAS WOUNDED AND SENSELESS THIS ACCIDENT MADE IT NECESSARY FOR THE YOUNG MAN TO TAKE COMMAND AND HE AT ONCE ORDERED THE MEN TO PULL FOR THEIR LIVES
937-148985-0021 WHERE FLOATED THE FRAIL BOATS FILLED WITH PALE FACES ALL TURNED FOR A LAST LOOK AT THE FATED BRENDA SLOWLY SETTLING TO HER WATERY GRAVE NO ONE SAW THE END HOWEVER FOR THE GALE SOON SWEPT THE WATCHERS FAR AWAY
937-148985-0022 AND SEPARATED THEM SOME NEVER TO MEET AGAIN TILL THE SEA GIVES UP ITS DEAD THE BOAT WHOSE FORTUNES WE MUST FOLLOW WAS ALONE WHEN DAWN CAME UP SHOWING THESE SURVIVORS ALL THE DANGERS OF THEIR SITUATION
937-148985-0023 FOOD AND WATER HAD BEEN PUT IN AND SUCH PROVISION FOR COMFORT AND SAFETY AS TIME ALLOWED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WITH A BADLY WOUNDED MAN TWO WOMEN AND SEVEN SAILORS THEIR SUPPLY WOULD NOT LAST LONG AND HELP WAS SORELY NEEDED
937-148985-0024 AND CHEERING ONE ANOTHER WITH PROPHECIES OF SPEEDY RESCUE SECOND MATE HOFFMANN WAS VERY BRAVE AND HELPFUL THOUGH HIS UNEXPECTED RESPONSIBILITY WEIGHED HEAVILY ON HIS SHOULDERS FOR THE CAPTAIN'S STATE SEEMED DESPERATE
937-148985-0025 THE POOR WIFE'S GRIEF WRUNG HIS HEART AND THE BLIND CONFIDENCE OF THE YOUNG GIRL IN HIS POWER TO SAVE THEM MADE HIM FEEL THAT NO SIGN OF DOUBT OR FEAR MUST LESSEN IT THE MEN DID THEIR PART READILY NOW BUT EMIL KNEW THAT IF STARVATION AND DESPAIR MADE BRUTES OF THEM
937-148985-0026 HIS TASK MIGHT BE A TERRIBLE ONE SO HE CLUTCHED HIS COURAGE WITH BOTH HANDS KEPT UP A MANLY FRONT AND SPOKE SO CHEERILY OF THEIR GOOD CHANCES THAT ALL INSTINCTIVELY TURNED TO HIM FOR GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT
937-148985-0027 THINGS LOOKED DARK AND HOPE BEGAN TO FAIL THE WOUNDED MAN WAS DELIRIOUS THE WIFE WORN OUT WITH ANXIETY AND SUSPENSE THE GIRL WEAK FOR WANT OF FOOD HAVING PUT AWAY HALF HER BISCUIT FOR HER MOTHER AND GIVEN HER SHARE OF WATER TO WET HER FATHER'S FEVERISH LIPS
937-148985-0028 THE SAILORS CEASED ROWING AND SAT GRIMLY WAITING OPENLY REPROACHING THEIR LEADER FOR NOT FOLLOWING THEIR ADVICE OTHERS DEMANDING MORE FOOD ALL WAXING DANGEROUS AS PRIVATION AND PAIN BROUGHT OUT THE ANIMAL INSTINCTS LURKING IN THEM
937-148985-0029 EMIL DID HIS BEST BUT MORTAL MAN WAS HELPLESS THERE AND HE COULD ONLY TURN HIS HAGGARD FACE FROM THE PITILESS SKY THAT DROPPED NO RAIN FOR THEIR THIRST TO THE BOUNDLESS SEA WHERE NO SAIL APPEARED TO GLADDEN THEIR LONGING EYES
937-148985-0030 ALL DAY HE TRIED TO CHEER AND COMFORT THEM WHILE HUNGER GNAWED THIRST PARCHED AND GROWING FEAR LAY HEAVY AT HIS HEART HE TOLD STORIES TO THE MEN IMPLORED THEM TO BEAR UP FOR THE HELPLESS WOMEN'S SAKE AND PROMISED REWARDS
937-148985-0031 IF THEY WOULD PULL WHILE THEY HAD STRENGTH TO REGAIN THE LOST ROUTE AS NEARLY AS HE COULD MAKE IT OUT AND INCREASE THEIR CHANCE OF RESCUE HE RIGGED AN AWNING OF SAILCLOTH OVER THE SUFFERING MAN AND TENDED HIM LIKE A SON COMFORTED THE WIFE
937-148985-0032 BY SINGING EVERY SONG HE KNEW OR RECOUNTING HIS ADVENTURES BY LAND AND SEA TILL SHE SMILED AND TOOK HEART FOR ALL ENDED WELL THE FOURTH DAY CAME AND THE SUPPLY OF FOOD AND WATER WAS NEARLY GONE
937-148985-0033 EMIL PROPOSED TO KEEP IT FOR THE SICK MAN AND THE WOMEN BUT TWO OF THE MEN REBELLED DEMANDING THEIR SHARE EMIL GAVE UP HIS AS AN EXAMPLE AND SEVERAL OF THE GOOD FELLOWS FOLLOWED IT
937-148985-0034 WITH THE QUIET HEROISM WHICH SO OFTEN CROPS UP IN ROUGH BUT MANLY NATURES THIS SHAMED THE OTHERS
937-148985-0035 BUT DURING THE NIGHT
937-148985-0036 LEFT THE WATCH TO THE MOST TRUSTWORTHY SAILOR THAT HE MIGHT SNATCH AN HOUR'S REST THESE TWO MEN GOT AT THE STORES AND STOLE THE LAST OF THE BREAD AND WATER AND THE ONE BOTTLE OF BRANDY WHICH WAS CAREFULLY HOARDED TO KEEP UP THEIR STRENGTH AND MAKE THE BRACKISH WATER DRINKABLE
937-148985-0037 HALF MAD WITH THIRST THEY DRANK GREEDILY AND BY MORNING ONE WAS IN A STUPOR FROM WHICH HE NEVER WOKE THE OTHER SO CRAZED BY THE STRONG STIMULANT THAT WHEN EMIL TRIED TO CONTROL HIM HE LEAPED OVERBOARD AND WAS LOST
937-148985-0038 HORROR STRICKEN BY THIS TERRIBLE SCENE THE OTHER MEN WERE SUBMISSIVE HENCEFORTH AND THE BOAT FLOATED ON AND ON WITH ITS SAD FREIGHT OF SUFFERING SOULS AND BODIES
937-148985-0039 ANOTHER TRIAL CAME TO THEM THAT LEFT ALL MORE DESPAIRING THAN BEFORE A SAIL APPEARED AND FOR A TIME A FRENZY OF JOY PREVAILED TO BE TURNED TO BITTEREST DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN IT PASSED BY
937-148985-0040 TOO FAR AWAY TO SEE THE SIGNALS WAVED TO THEM OR HEAR THE FRANTIC CRIES FOR HELP THAT RANG ACROSS THE SEA EMIL'S HEART SANK THEN FOR THE CAPTAIN SEEMED DYING AND THE WOMEN COULD NOT HOLD OUT MUCH LONGER HE KEPT UP TILL NIGHT CAME
937-148985-0041 BROKEN ONLY BY THE FEEBLE MURMURING OF THE SICK MAN THE WHISPERED PRAYERS OF THE POOR WIFE THE CEASELESS SWASH OF WAVES EMIL HID HIS FACE AND HAD AN HOUR OF SILENT AGONY THAT AGED HIM MORE THAN YEARS OF HAPPY LIFE COULD HAVE DONE
937-148985-0042 IT WAS NOT THE PHYSICAL HARDSHIP THAT DAUNTED HIM THOUGH WANT AND WEAKNESS TORTURED HIM IT WAS HIS DREADFUL POWERLESSNESS TO CONQUER THE CRUEL FATE THAT SEEMED HANGING OVER THEM THE MEN HE CARED LITTLE FOR
937-148985-0043 SINCE THESE PERILS WERE BUT A PART OF THE LIFE THEY CHOSE BUT THE MASTER HE LOVED THE GOOD WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN SO KIND TO HIM THE SWEET GIRL WHOSE WINSOME PRESENCE HAD MADE THE LONG VOYAGE SO PLEASANT FOR THEM ALL
937-148985-0044 AS HE SAT THERE WITH HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS BOWED DOWN BY THE FIRST GREAT TRIAL OF HIS YOUNG LIFE THE STARLESS SKY OVERHEAD THE RESTLESS SEA BENEATH AND ALL AROUND HIM SUFFERING FOR WHICH HE HAD NO HELP
937-148985-0045 A SOFT SOUND BROKE THE SILENCE AND HE LISTENED LIKE ONE IN A DREAM IT WAS MARY SINGING TO HER MOTHER WHO LAY SOBBING IN HER ARMS SPENT WITH THIS LONG ANGUISH A VERY FAINT AND BROKEN VOICE IT WAS
937-148985-0046 BUT THE LOVING HEART TURNED INSTINCTIVELY TO THE GREAT HELPER IN THIS HOUR OF DESPAIR AND HE HEARD HER FEEBLE CRY IT WAS A SWEET OLD HYMN OFTEN SUNG AT PLUMFIELD AND AS HE LISTENED ALL THE HAPPY PAST CAME BACK SO CLEARLY
937-148985-0047 THAT EMIL FORGOT THE BITTER PRESENT AND WAS AT HOME AGAIN HIS TALK ON THE HOUSETOP WITH AUNT JO SEEMED BUT YESTERDAY AND WITH A PANG OF SELF REPROACH HE THOUGHT THE SCARLET STRAND I MUST REMEMBER IT
937-148985-0048 EMIL FOR A LITTLE WHILE FORGOT HIS BURDEN IN A DREAM OF PLUMFIELD HE SAW THEM ALL HEARD THE FAMILIAR VOICES FELT THE GRIP OF WELCOMING HANDS AND SEEMED TO SAY TO HIMSELF WELL
937-148985-0049 A SUDDEN SHOUT STARTLED HIM FROM THAT BRIEF REST AND A DROP ON HIS FOREHEAD TOLD HIM THAT THE BLESSED RAIN HAD COME AT LAST BRINGING SALVATION WITH IT FOR THIRST IS HARDER TO BEAR THAN HUNGER HEAT OR COLD WELCOMED BY CRIES OF JOY
937-148985-0050 ALL LIFTED UP THEIR PARCHED LIPS HELD OUT THEIR HANDS AND SPREAD THEIR GARMENTS TO CATCH THE GREAT DROPS THAT SOON CAME POURING DOWN TO COOL THE SICK MAN'S FEVER QUENCH THE AGONY OF THIRST AND BRING REFRESHMENT TO EVERY WEARY BODY IN THE BOAT
937-148985-0051 ALL NIGHT IT FELL ALL NIGHT THE CASTAWAYS REVELLED IN THE SAVING SHOWER AND TOOK HEART AGAIN LIKE DYING PLANTS REVIVED BY HEAVEN'S DEW THE CLOUDS BROKE AWAY AT DAWN AND EMIL SPRUNG UP
937-148985-0052 BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL AS HIS EYE SWEPT THE HORIZON CLEAR AGAINST THE ROSY SKY SHONE THE WHITE SAILS OF A SHIP SO NEAR THAT THEY COULD SEE THE PENNON AT HER MAST HEAD AND BLACK FIGURES MOVING ON THE DECK
937-148985-0053 ONE CRY BROKE FROM ALL THOSE EAGER THROATS AND RANG ACROSS THE SEA AS EVERY MAN WAVED HAT OR HANDKERCHIEF AND THE WOMEN STRETCHED IMPLORING HANDS TOWARDS THIS GREAT WHITE ANGEL OF DELIVERANCE COMING DOWN UPON THEM
937-148985-0054 GIVING HIM HIS REWARD IN TEARS AND BLESSINGS AS THEIR GRATEFUL HEARTS OVERFLOWED HE ALWAYS SAID THAT WAS THE PROUDEST MOMENT OF HIS LIFE AS HE STOOD THERE HOLDING MARY IN HIS ARMS FOR THE BRAVE GIRL
937-148985-0055 WHO HAD KEPT UP SO LONG BROKE DOWN THEN AND CLUNG TO HIM HALF FAINTING WHILE HER MOTHER BUSIED HERSELF ABOUT THE INVALID WHO SEEMED TO FEEL THE JOYFUL STIR AND GAVE AN ORDER AS IF AGAIN ON THE DECK OF HIS LOST SHIP
937-148985-0056 IT WAS SOON OVER AND THEN ALL WERE SAFELY ABOARD THE GOOD URANIA HOMEWARD BOUND EMIL SAW HIS FRIENDS IN TENDER HANDS HIS MEN AMONG THEIR MATES
937-148985-0057 AND TOLD THE STORY OF THE WRECK BEFORE HE THOUGHT OF HIMSELF THE SAVOURY ODOUR OF THE SOUP CARRIED BY TO THE CABIN FOR THE LADIES REMINDED HIM THAT HE WAS STARVING AND A SUDDEN STAGGER BETRAYED HIS WEAKNESS
937-148985-0058 HE WAS INSTANTLY BORNE AWAY TO BE HALF KILLED BY KINDNESS AND BEING FED CLOTHED AND COMFORTED WAS LEFT TO REST JUST AS THE SURGEON LEFT THE STATE ROOM HE ASKED IN HIS BROKEN VOICE WHAT DAY IS THIS
937-148985-0059 MY HEAD IS SO CONFUSED I'VE LOST MY RECKONING THANKSGIVING DAY MAN AND WE'LL GIVE YOU A REGULAR NEW ENGLAND DINNER IF YOU'LL EAT IT ANSWERED THE SURGEON HEARTILY BUT EMIL WAS TOO SPENT TO DO ANYTHING
