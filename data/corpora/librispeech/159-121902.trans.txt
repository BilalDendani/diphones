159-121902-0000 VERILY WONDROUS GREAT ARE THY PROMISES YET I DO NOT DOUBT BUT THOU CANST MAKE THEM GOOD ONLY KEEP ME NOT IN SUSPENSE AFTER RAISING SUCH HOPES LEARN THEN FIRST SAID SHE HOW THAT POWER EVER WAITS UPON THE GOOD
159-121902-0001 WHILE THE BAD ARE LEFT WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF STRENGTH
159-121902-0002 FOR SINCE GOOD AND EVIL ARE CONTRARIES IF IT IS MADE PLAIN THAT GOOD IS POWER THE FEEBLENESS OF EVIL IS CLEARLY SEEN AND CONVERSELY IF THE FRAIL NATURE OF EVIL IS MADE MANIFEST THE STRENGTH OF GOOD IS THEREBY KNOWN
159-121902-0003 HOWEVER TO WIN AMPLER CREDENCE FOR MY CONCLUSION I WILL PURSUE BOTH PATHS AND DRAW CONFIRMATION FOR MY STATEMENTS FIRST IN ONE WAY AND THEN IN THE OTHER THE CARRYING OUT OF ANY HUMAN ACTION DEPENDS UPON TWO THINGS
159-121902-0004 WHEREAS IF THERE BE NO POWER THE WILL IS ALL IN VAIN AND SO IF THOU SEEST ANY MAN WISHING TO ATTAIN SOME END YET UTTERLY FAILING TO ATTAIN IT THOU CANST NOT DOUBT THAT HE LACKED THE POWER OF GETTING WHAT HE WISHED FOR
159-121902-0005 WHY CERTAINLY NOT THERE IS NO DENYING IT CANST THOU THEN DOUBT THAT HE WHOM THOU SEEST TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT HE WILLED
159-121902-0006 OF COURSE NOT THEN IN RESPECT OF WHAT HE CAN ACCOMPLISH A MAN IS TO BE RECKONED STRONG IN RESPECT OF WHAT HE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WEAK GRANTED SAID I THEN DOST THOU REMEMBER THAT BY OUR FORMER REASONINGS
159-121902-0007 IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE WHOLE AIM OF MAN'S WILL THOUGH THE MEANS OF PURSUIT VARY IS SET INTENTLY UPON HAPPINESS I DO REMEMBER THAT THIS TOO WAS PROVED DOST THOU ALSO CALL TO MIND HOW HAPPINESS IS ABSOLUTE GOOD
159-121902-0008 WITH ONE INDISTINGUISHABLE PURPOSE STRIVE TO REACH GOOD YES THAT FOLLOWS BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT BY THE ATTAINMENT OF GOOD MEN BECOME GOOD IT IS THEN DO THE GOOD ATTAIN THEIR OBJECT
159-121902-0009 IT SEEMS SO BUT IF THE BAD WERE TO ATTAIN THE GOOD WHICH IS THEIR OBJECT THEY COULD NOT BE BAD NO
159-121902-0010 THE OTHER ATTAIN IT NOT IS THERE ANY DOUBT THAT THE GOOD ARE ENDUED WITH POWER WHILE THEY WHO ARE BAD ARE WEAK IF ANY DOUBT IT HE IS INCAPABLE OF REFLECTING ON THE NATURE OF THINGS OR THE CONSEQUENCES INVOLVED IN REASONING
159-121902-0011 INSTEAD OF WHICH IN A WAY OTHER THAN IS AGREEABLE TO ITS NATURE IT I WILL NOT SAY FULFILS ITS FUNCTION BUT FEIGNS TO FULFIL IT WHICH OF THESE TWO WOULD IN THY VIEW BE THE STRONGER I GUESS THY MEANING BUT I PRAY THEE
159-121902-0012 WHEREAS THE BAD TRY TO ATTAIN THIS SAME GOOD THROUGH ALL MANNER OF CONCUPISCENCE WHICH IS NOT THE NATURAL WAY OF ATTAINING GOOD OR DOST THOU THINK OTHERWISE NAY RATHER ONE FURTHER CONSEQUENCE IS CLEAR TO ME
159-121902-0013 FOR FROM MY ADMISSIONS IT MUST NEEDS FOLLOW THAT THE GOOD HAVE POWER AND THE BAD ARE IMPOTENT THOU ANTICIPATEST RIGHTLY AND THAT AS PHYSICIANS RECKON IS A SIGN THAT NATURE IS SET WORKING
159-121902-0014 BUT SINCE I SEE THEE SO READY AT UNDERSTANDING I WILL HEAP PROOF ON PROOF LOOK HOW MANIFEST IS THE EXTREMITY OF VICIOUS MEN'S WEAKNESS THEY CANNOT EVEN REACH THAT GOAL TO WHICH THE AIM OF NATURE LEADS AND ALMOST CONSTRAINS THEM
159-121902-0015 BUT WHICH THEY CANNOT WIN OR HOLD NAY THEIR FAILURE CONCERNS THE VERY SUM AND CROWN OF THINGS POOR WRETCHES THEY FAIL TO COMPASS EVEN THAT FOR WHICH THEY TOIL DAY AND NIGHT
159-121902-0016 WHO SO ATTAINS THE END OF HIS DESIRES THAT NOTHING FURTHER TO BE DESIRED LIES BEYOND WHENCE FOLLOWS THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSION THAT THEY WHO ARE WICKED ARE SEEN LIKEWISE TO BE WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF STRENGTH FOR WHY DO THEY FORSAKE VIRTUE AND FOLLOW VICE
159-121902-0017 IS IT FROM IGNORANCE OF WHAT IS GOOD WELL WHAT IS MORE WEAK AND FEEBLE THAN THE BLINDNESS OF IGNORANCE DO THEY KNOW WHAT THEY OUGHT TO FOLLOW BUT LUST DRIVES THEM ASIDE OUT OF THE WAY IF IT BE SO THEY ARE STILL FRAIL BY REASON OF THEIR INCONTINENCE
159-121902-0018 FOR THEY CANNOT FIGHT AGAINST VICE OR DO THEY KNOWINGLY AND WILFULLY FORSAKE THE GOOD AND TURN ASIDE TO VICE WHY AT THIS RATE THEY NOT ONLY CEASE TO HAVE POWER BUT CEASE TO BE AT ALL FOR THEY WHO FORSAKE THE COMMON END OF ALL THINGS THAT ARE
159-121902-0019 THAT WE SHOULD ASSERT THAT THE BAD WHO FORM THE GREATER PART OF MANKIND DO NOT EXIST BUT THE FACT IS SO I DO NOT INDEED DENY THAT THEY WHO ARE BAD ARE BAD BUT THAT THEY ARE IN AN UNQUALIFIED AND ABSOLUTE SENSE I DENY
159-121902-0020 THE BAD HAVE AN ABILITY NOR DO I WISH TO DENY IT ONLY THIS ABILITY OF THEIRS COMES NOT FROM STRENGTH BUT FROM IMPOTENCE FOR THEIR ABILITY IS TO DO EVIL
159-121902-0021 THAT NOTHING HAS MORE POWER THAN SUPREME GOOD WE DID SAID I BUT THAT SAME HIGHEST GOOD CANNOT DO EVIL CERTAINLY NOT IS THERE ANYONE THEN WHO THINKS THAT MEN ARE ABLE TO DO ALL THINGS NONE BUT A MADMAN
159-121902-0022 THE ABILITY TO COMMIT CRIME CANNOT BE REFERRED TO THE GOOD THEREFORE IT IS NOT A THING TO BE DESIRED AND YET ALL POWER IS DESIRABLE IT IS CLEAR THEN THAT ABILITY TO DO EVIL IS NOT POWER
159-121902-0023 THE WISE ALONE ARE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY WOULD WHILE THE WICKED FOLLOW THEIR OWN HEARTS LUST BUT CAN NOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT THEY WOULD FOR THEY GO ON IN THEIR WILFULNESS
159-121902-0024 SORROW HIS SPIRIT VEXES SORE AND EMPTY HOPES DELUDE
