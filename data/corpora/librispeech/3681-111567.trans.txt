3681-111567-0000 THE EGG MOTHER CRAB CARRIES HER EGGS WITH HER UNDER HER TAIL WHICH ITSELF IS ALWAYS KEPT TUCKED UP UNDER HER BODY OUT OF EACH EGG THERE COMES THE QUEEREST LITTLE CREATURE IT IS JUST LARGE ENOUGH TO BE SEEN AS IT WRIGGLES IN THE WATER
3681-111567-0001 THEN ITS SKIN SPLITS AND THERE APPEARS A QUAINT THING WITH LONG FEATHERY LEGS A BIG HEAD A SPIKE ON THE BACK OF ITS HEAD AND ANOTHER SPIKE LIKE A NOSE WHO WOULD SUSPECT THIS STRANGE ATOM WOULD TURN INTO A CRAB WELL NOBODY DID
3681-111567-0002 IT WAS CALLED A Z O E A BUT YOU CAN CALL IT A CRAB CATERPILLAR OR LARVA THE MAGGOT IS THE LARVA OF THE FLY AND THE ZOEA IS THE LARVA OF THE CRAB
3681-111567-0003 WITH CROWDS OF ITS BROTHERS AND SISTERS THE ZOEA KICKS ABOUT ON THE SURFACE OF THE SEA FISHES AND EVEN GREAT WHALES SWALLOW THESE TINY THINGS BY THE MILLION
3681-111567-0004 THE CRAB LARVA EATS AND GROWS AGAIN AND AGAIN ITS SKIN SPLITS AND A RATHER DIFFERENT ZOEA APPEARS THIS HAPPENS ABOUT ONCE A WEEK UNTIL HEY PRESTO THE SPIKED ZOEA IS NOW RATHER LIKE A CRAB
3681-111567-0005 AND NOW IT HAS TINY CLAWS AND TWO EYES AT THE END OF STALKS YET IT STILL OWNS A TAIL AT LAST THIS IS TUCKED UP UNDER ITS BODY AND LO OUR LITTLE FRIEND HAS CHANGED INTO A VERY SMALL CRAB NO LONGER ABLE TO SWIM ABOUT
3681-111567-0006 IT COMES TO GET A LIVING IN THE SHALLOW POOLS OF THE SHORE
3681-111567-0007 HE KNOWS HOW TO DIG HIMSELF INTO THE SAND AND WORK HIS SHELL WELL DOWN THEN ONLY HIS FUNNY EYES ON STALKS PEER UP AT YOU AT THIS TIME OF HIS LIFE HE HAS TO MAKE HIMSELF SCARCE
3681-111567-0008 AND THEY THEMSELVES HUNT SAND HOPPERS AND EAT ANYTHING THEY CAN FIND OR STEAL SO THEY GROW BIGGER AND THEN LIKE THE BOY WHO GROWS QUICKLY THE CRAB FINDS HIS SHELLY SUIT A SIZE TOO SMALL FOR HIM NOW LOOK AT HIS SUIT IT IS A HARD COAT
3681-111567-0009 A COMPLETE SUIT OF ARMOUR TO PROTECT HIS SOFT BODY OUR PICTURE SHOWS THE LOBSTER THE CRAB'S COUSIN THE SHRIMP AND PRAWN AND LOBSTER ARE RELATIONS OF THE CRAB THESE CRUSTACEANS AS THEY ARE CALLED
3681-111567-0010 SOON THE SHELL BREAKS ACROSS AND THE CRAB STRUGGLES TO GET FREE AT LAST HE BACKS OUT AND LEAVES HIS OLD SUIT FOR EVER IT IS A WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE FOR HE HAS WITHDRAWN EVEN FROM THE LEGS
3681-111567-0011 CLAWS FEELERS BRISTLES EYE STALKS AND EYES THE OLD SHELL IS LEFT QUITE WHOLE A PERFECT CRAB BUT WITH NO CRAB INSIDE IT NOW THE CRAB IN HIS NEW SUIT HIDES AWAY
3681-111567-0012 HE KNOWS THAT HE IS A SOFT FLABBY CREATURE AT THIS TIME AND THAT OTHER ANIMALS EVEN MISSUS CRAB WOULD BE GLAD TO MEET HIM AND EAT HIM WHILE HIS COVERING IS YET SOFT HE GROWS QUICKLY
3681-111567-0013 AND CAST THEIR SHELLS AS WE HAVE SEEN CRABS CAN SEE AND HEAR AND SMELL AND THEY MUST ALSO HAVE A FINE SENSE OF TOUCH I WAS ONCE WATCHING A BIG CRAB EATING HIS DINNER UNDER A ROCKY LEDGE IN A LARGE GLASS TANK
3681-111567-0014 ONE BY ONE EACH BIT WAS GRAVELY CARRIED TO HIS MOUTH AND TUCKED IN AND THEN HE REACHED OUT FOR ANOTHER THOUGH I WAS VERY CLOSE TO THE CRAB I COULD HARDLY SEE THE TINY SCRAPS WHICH HE WAS ABLE TO PICK UP SO EASILY
3681-111567-0015 ONE OF THE STRANGEST CRABS IS THE HERMIT YOU WOULD THINK THAT NATURE HAD PLAYED A JOKE ON HIM FOR HE HAS ONLY HALF A SUIT OF ARMOUR HIS TAIL PART IS SOFT HE WOULD HAVE A BAD TIME IN THE SEA BUT FOR A DODGE HE HAS LEARNT
3681-111567-0016 THE BABY HERMIT TAKES THE EMPTY HOME OF A PERIWINKLE AS HE GROWS HE NEEDS A LARGER HOUSE AND SO LEAVES THE TIGHT SHELL AND POPS HIS TAIL INTO A BIGGER ONE GENERALLY A WHELK SHELL IF HE MEETS WITH ANOTHER HERMIT THERE IS A BATTLE
3681-111567-0017 ONE TRYING TO STEAL THE OTHER'S SHELL OUR COLOURED PICTURE PAGE THIRTY FIVE SHOWS SOME HERMITS AT WAR FIGHTING HOUSE HUNTING AND MOVING HOUSE SEEM TO BE THE HERMIT'S FAVOURITE PURSUITS
3681-111567-0018 HIS FIRST CARE IS TO PROTECT THAT SOFT TAIL OF HIS HIS RIGHT CLAW IS LARGE AND STRONG
3681-111567-0019 THEY CAN SWIM ALONG BY USING THE LITTLE SWIMMERETS UNDER THEIR BODIES OR BY RAPIDLY BENDING DOWN THEIR POWERFUL TAILS LOBSTERS ARE ABLE TO SHOOT BACKWARDS THROUGH THE WATER AT A GREAT PACE
3681-111567-0020 ARE OFTEN ON SALE IN THE FISHMONGER'S SHOP LIKE THE CRABS AND PRAWNS THEY ARE USUALLY CAUGHT IN TRAPS OR POTS BAITED WITH PIECES OF FISH AND LEFT AMONG THE ROCKS
3681-111567-0021 SOME BEING LIKE BEE HIVES MADE OF CANE OR WICKER
3681-111567-0022 THIS GRADUALLY GROWS INTO A NEW LIMB
3681-111567-0023 WHAT A USEFUL GIFT THIS MUST BE TO AN ANIMAL LIKE THE LOBSTER WHOSE WHOLE LIFE IS ONE TERRIBLE FIGHT AFTER ANOTHER THE BABY LOBSTERS LIKE THE BABY CRABS ARE QUITE UNLIKE THEIR PARENTS
3681-111567-0024 THEY SWIM ABOUT AT THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND ALREADY THEY SEIZE EVERY CHANCE OF FIGHTING AND EATING THEIR SMALL NEIGHBOURS
3681-111567-0025 HERE THEY EAT FIGHT GROW AND CHANGE THEIR COATS JUST AS THE YOUNG CRABS DO THEY ARE NOW LIKE THEIR PARENTS SOMETIMES THEY GROW TO BE HUGE AND TO WEIGH AS MUCH AS TEN AND A HALF POUNDS
3681-111567-0026 THE MOTHER LOBSTER CARRIES AS MANY AS THIRTY THOUSAND EGGS UNDER HER BODY NEEDLESS TO SAY A VERY VERY FEW OF THIS ENORMOUS FAMILY SURVIVE THE DANGERS OF THE SEA THE RULE THERE IS EAT AND BE EATEN
3681-111567-0027 EXERCISES ONE WHAT IS A CRAB LARVA LIKE TWO GIVE THE NAMES OF FOUR CRUSTACEANS THREE
3681-111567-0028 WHY DOES THE CRAB HAVE TO CHANGE ITS SHELL FOUR WHY DOES IT HIDE AWAY AT THAT TIME FIVE OF WHAT USE ARE SHORE CRABS
