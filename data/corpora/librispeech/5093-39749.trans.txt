5093-39749-0000 AND GAVE THEM PRIVILEGES EQUAL TO THOSE OF THE MACEDONIANS AND GREEKS WHO WERE THE INHABITANTS
5093-39749-0001 AN ARGUMENT FOR WHICH YOU HAVE IN THIS
5093-39749-0002 FROM THE PROPER OFFICERS BELONGING TO THEIR EXERCISES AS THE VALUE OF THAT OIL WHICH MONEY WHEN THE PEOPLE OF ANTIOCH WOULD HAVE DEPRIVED THEM OF IN THE LAST WAR MUCIANUS WHO WAS THEN PRESIDENT OF SYRIA PRESERVED IT TO THEM
5093-39749-0003 AND WHEN THE PEOPLE OF ALEXANDRIA AND OF ANTIOCH DID AFTER THAT AT THE TIME THAT VESPASIAN AND TITUS HIS SON GOVERNED THE HABITABLE EARTH PRAY THAT THESE PRIVILEGES OF CITIZENS MIGHT BE TAKEN AWAY
5093-39749-0004 YET DID NOT THEY TAKE AWAY ANY OF THEIR FOREMENTIONED PRIVILEGES BELONGING TO THEM AS CITIZENS BUT RESTRAINED THEIR ANGER AND OVERCAME THE PRAYERS OF THE ALEXANDRIANS AND ANTIOCHIANS WHO WERE A VERY POWERFUL PEOPLE
5093-39749-0005 NOR OUT OF THEIR OLD GRUDGE AT THOSE WHOSE WICKED OPPOSITION THEY HAD SUBDUED IN THE WAR NOR WOULD THEY ALTER ANY OF THE ANCIENT FAVORS GRANTED TO THE JEWS BUT SAID THAT THOSE WHO HAD BORNE ARMS AGAINST THEM AND FOUGHT THEM
5093-39749-0006 HAD SUFFERED PUNISHMENT ALREADY AND THAT IT WAS NOT JUST TO DEPRIVE THOSE
5093-39749-0007 WAS OF THE LIKE DISPOSITION TOWARDS THE JEWS FOR WHEN THE PEOPLE OF IONIA WERE VERY ANGRY AT THEM AND BESOUGHT AGRIPPA THAT THEY AND THEY ONLY MIGHT HAVE THOSE PRIVILEGES OF CITIZENS WHICH ANTIOCHUS THE GRANDSON OF SELEUCUS
5093-39749-0008 WHO BY THE GREEKS WAS CALLED THE GOD HAD BESTOWED ON THEM AND DESIRED THAT IF THE JEWS WERE TO BE JOINT PARTAKERS WITH THEM THEY MIGHT BE OBLIGED TO WORSHIP THE GODS THEY THEMSELVES WORSHIPPED
5093-39749-0009 BUT WHEN THESE MATTERS WERE BROUGHT TO THE TRIAL THE JEWS PREVAILED AND OBTAINED LEAVE TO MAKE USE OF THEIR OWN CUSTOMS AND THIS UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF NICOLAUS OF DAMASCUS FOR AGRIPPA GAVE SENTENCE THAT HE COULD NOT INNOVATE
5093-39749-0010 AND IF ANY ONE HATH A MIND TO KNOW THIS MATTER ACCURATELY LET HIM PERUSE THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THIRD AND HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOURTH BOOKS OF THE HISTORY OF THIS NICOLAUS NOW AS TO THIS DETERMINATION OF AGRIPPA
5093-39749-0011 IT IS NOT SO MUCH TO BE ADMIRED FOR AT THAT TIME OUR NATION HAD NOT MADE WAR AGAINST THE ROMANS
5093-39749-0012 IT FELL OUT THAT THESE NATIONS WERE EQUALLY SUFFERERS BOTH WHEN HE WAS BEATEN AND WHEN HE BEAT THE OTHERS SO THAT THEY WERE VERY LIKE TO A SHIP IN A STORM WHICH IS TOSSED BY THE WAVES ON BOTH SIDES
5093-39749-0013 AND WHEN PHILOPATER WAS DEAD HIS SON SENT OUT A GREAT ARMY UNDER SCOPAS THE GENERAL OF HIS FORCES AGAINST THE INHABITANTS OF CELESYRIA WHO TOOK MANY OF THEIR CITIES AND IN PARTICULAR OUR NATION
5093-39749-0014 AND INFORMED THEM WHAT REWARDS HE HAD RESOLVED TO BESTOW ON THEM FOR THAT THEIR BEHAVIOR
5093-39749-0015 WENT IN HASTE TO THE SUPERIOR PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND IN THE WINTER TIME OVERTHREW THE NATION OF THE JEWS
5093-39749-0016 YET DO I PUT OFF THAT HISTORY TILL ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY THIS IT IS WHICH POLYBIUS RELATES BUT WE WILL RETURN TO THE SERIES OF THE HISTORY WHEN WE HAVE FIRST PRODUCED THE EPISTLES OF KING ANTIOCHUS
5093-39749-0017 KING ANTIOCHUS TO PTOLEMY SENDETH GREETING SINCE THE JEWS UPON OUR FIRST ENTRANCE ON THEIR COUNTRY DEMONSTRATED THEIR FRIENDSHIP TOWARDS US
5093-39749-0018 AND WHEN WE CAME TO THEIR CITY JERUSALEM RECEIVED US IN A SPLENDID MANNER AND CAME TO MEET US WITH THEIR SENATE AND GAVE ABUNDANCE OF PROVISIONS TO OUR SOLDIERS
5093-39749-0019 AND OUT OF LIBANUS TAX FREE AND THE SAME I WOULD HAVE OBSERVED AS TO THOSE OTHER MATERIALS WHICH WILL BE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO RENDER THE TEMPLE MORE GLORIOUS
5093-39749-0020 AND LET ALL OF THAT NATION LIVE ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND LET THE SENATE AND THE PRIESTS AND THE SCRIBES OF THE TEMPLE AND THE SACRED SINGERS BE DISCHARGED FROM POLL MONEY AND THE CROWN TAX AND OTHER TAXES ALSO
5093-39749-0021 I GRANT A DISCHARGE FROM TAXES FOR THREE YEARS TO ITS PRESENT INHABITANTS AND TO SUCH AS SHALL COME TO IT UNTIL THE MONTH HYPERHERETUS WE ALSO DISCHARGE THEM FOR THE FUTURE
5093-39749-0022 FROM A THIRD PART OF THEIR TAXES THAT THE LOSSES THEY HAVE SUSTAINED MAY BE REPAIRED AND ALL THOSE CITIZENS THAT HAVE BEEN CARRIED AWAY AND ARE BECOME SLAVES
5093-39749-0023 HE ALSO PUBLISHED A DECREE THROUGH ALL HIS KINGDOM IN HONOR OF THE TEMPLE WHICH CONTAINED WHAT FOLLOWS IT SHALL BE LAWFUL FOR NO FOREIGNER TO COME WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE TEMPLE ROUND ABOUT WHICH THING IS FORBIDDEN ALSO TO THE JEWS
5093-39749-0024 NOR THAT OF LEOPARDS OR FOXES OR HARES AND IN GENERAL THAT OF ANY ANIMAL WHICH IS FORBIDDEN FOR THE JEWS TO EAT NOR LET THEIR SKINS BE BROUGHT INTO IT NOR LET ANY SUCH ANIMAL BE BRED UP IN THE CITY
5093-39749-0025 LET THEM ONLY BE PERMITTED TO USE THE SACRIFICES DERIVED FROM THEIR FOREFATHERS WITH WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO MAKE ACCEPTABLE ATONEMENTS TO GOD AND HE THAT TRANSGRESSETH ANY OF THESE ORDERS
5093-39749-0026 LET HIM PAY TO THE PRIESTS THREE THOUSAND DRACHMAE OF SILVER
5093-39749-0027 HAVING BEEN INFORMED THAT A SEDITION IS ARISEN IN LYDIA
5093-39749-0028 FOR I AM PERSUADED THAT THEY WILL BE WELL DISPOSED GUARDIANS OF OUR POSSESSIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR PIETY TOWARDS GOD AND BECAUSE I KNOW THAT MY PREDECESSORS HAVE BORNE WITNESS TO THEM THAT THEY ARE FAITHFUL
5093-39749-0029 I WILL THEREFORE THOUGH IT BE A LABORIOUS WORK THAT THOU REMOVE THESE JEWS UNDER A PROMISE THAT THEY SHALL BE PERMITTED TO USE THEIR OWN LAWS AND WHEN THOU SHALT HAVE BROUGHT THEM TO THE PLACES FOREMENTIONED
5093-39749-0030 THOU SHALT GIVE EVERYONE OF THEIR FAMILIES A PLACE FOR BUILDING THEIR HOUSES AND A PORTION OF THE LAND FOR THEIR HUSBANDRY AND FOR THE PLANTATION OF THEIR VINES
