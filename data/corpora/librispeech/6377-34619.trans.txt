6377-34619-0000 RELYING GWYNPLAINE ACCEPTED THESE ORPHANS WERE ALL IN ALL TO EACH OTHER THE FEEBLE AND THE DEFORMED THE WIDOWED WERE BETROTHED
6377-34619-0001 AN INEXPRESSIBLE THANKSGIVING AROSE OUT OF THEIR DISTRESS THEY WERE GRATEFUL TO WHOM TO THE OBSCURE IMMENSITY BE GRATEFUL IN YOUR OWN HEARTS THAT SUFFICES
6377-34619-0002 THANKSGIVING HAS WINGS AND FLIES TO ITS RIGHT DESTINATION YOUR PRAYER KNOWS ITS WAY BETTER THAN YOU CAN HOW MANY MEN HAVE BELIEVED THAT THEY PRAYED TO JUPITER WHEN THEY PRAYED TO JEHOVAH
6377-34619-0003 HOW MANY BELIEVERS IN AMULETS ARE LISTENED TO BY THE ALMIGHTY
6377-34619-0004 DEFORMITY IS EXPULSION BLINDNESS IS A PRECIPICE THE EXPELLED ONE HAD BEEN ADOPTED THE PRECIPICE WAS HABITABLE GWYNPLAINE HAD SEEN A BRILLIANT LIGHT DESCENDING ON HIM
6377-34619-0005 IN AN ARRANGEMENT OF DESTINY WHICH SEEMED TO PUT IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF A DREAM A WHITE CLOUD OF BEAUTY HAVING THE FORM OF A WOMAN A RADIANT VISION IN WHICH THERE WAS A HEART AND THE PHANTOM ALMOST A CLOUD AND YET A WOMAN CLASPED HIM
6377-34619-0006 AND THE APPARITION EMBRACED HIM AND THE HEART DESIRED HIM GWYNPLAINE WAS NO LONGER DEFORMED HE WAS BELOVED THE ROSE DEMANDED THE CATERPILLAR IN MARRIAGE
6377-34619-0007 FEELING THAT WITHIN THE CATERPILLAR THERE WAS A DIVINE BUTTERFLY GWYNPLAINE THE REJECTED WAS CHOSEN TO HAVE ONE'S DESIRE IS EVERYTHING GWYNPLAINE HAD HIS
6377-34619-0008 THE ABJECTION OF THE DISFIGURED MAN WAS EXALTED AND DILATED INTO INTOXICATION INTO DELIGHT INTO BELIEF AND A HAND WAS STRETCHED OUT TOWARDS THE MELANCHOLY HESITATION OF THE BLIND GIRL
6377-34619-0009 TO GUIDE HER IN HER DARKNESS
6377-34619-0010 WHICH ABSORBED THEM THE REJECTED FOUND A REFUGE IN EACH OTHER TWO BLANKS COMBINING FILLED EACH OTHER UP THEY HELD TOGETHER BY WHAT THEY LACKED IN THAT IN WHICH ONE WAS POOR
6377-34619-0011 THE OTHER WAS RICH THE MISFORTUNE OF THE ONE MADE THE TREASURE OF THE OTHER HAD DEA NOT BEEN BLIND WOULD SHE HAVE CHOSEN GWYNPLAINE HAD GWYNPLAINE NOT BEEN DISFIGURED
6377-34619-0012 SHE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE REJECTED THE DEFORMED AS HE WOULD HAVE PASSED BY THE INFIRM WHAT HAPPINESS FOR DEA THAT GWYNPLAINE WAS HIDEOUS WHAT GOOD FORTUNE FOR GWYNPLAINE THAT DEA WAS BLIND
6377-34619-0013 APART FROM THEIR PROVIDENTIAL MATCHING THEY WERE IMPOSSIBLE TO EACH OTHER A MIGHTY WANT OF EACH OTHER WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR LOVES GWYNPLAINE SAVED DEA
6377-34619-0014 APPOSITION OF MISERY PRODUCED ADHERENCE IT WAS THE EMBRACE OF THOSE SWALLOWED IN THE ABYSS NONE CLOSER NONE MORE HOPELESS NONE MORE EXQUISITE
6377-34619-0015 GWYNPLAINE HAD A THOUGHT WHAT SHOULD I BE WITHOUT HER DEA HAD A THOUGHT WHAT SHOULD I BE WITHOUT HIM THE EXILE OF EACH MADE A COUNTRY FOR BOTH THE TWO INCURABLE FATALITIES
6377-34619-0016 THE STIGMATA OF GWYNPLAINE AND THE BLINDNESS OF DEA JOINED THEM TOGETHER IN CONTENTMENT THEY SUFFICED TO EACH OTHER THEY IMAGINED NOTHING BEYOND EACH OTHER TO SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER WAS A DELIGHT
6377-34619-0017 TO APPROACH WAS BEATITUDE BY FORCE OF RECIPROCAL INTUITION THEY BECAME UNITED IN THE SAME REVERIE AND THOUGHT THE SAME THOUGHTS IN GWYNPLAINE'S TREAD
6377-34619-0018 THEY TIGHTENED THEIR MUTUAL GRASP IN A SORT OF SIDEREAL CHIAROSCURO FULL OF PERFUMES OF GLEAMS OF MUSIC OF THE LUMINOUS ARCHITECTURE OF DREAMS THEY BELONGED TO EACH OTHER
6377-34619-0019 THEY KNEW THEMSELVES TO BE FOR EVER UNITED IN THE SAME JOY AND THE SAME ECSTASY AND NOTHING COULD BE STRANGER THAN THIS CONSTRUCTION OF AN EDEN BY TWO OF THE DAMNED THEY WERE INEXPRESSIBLY HAPPY
6377-34619-0020 IN THEIR HELL THEY HAD CREATED HEAVEN SUCH WAS THY POWER O LOVE DEA HEARD GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH GWYNPLAINE SAW DEA'S SMILE THUS IDEAL FELICITY WAS FOUND
6377-34619-0021 THE PERFECT JOY OF LIFE WAS REALIZED THE MYSTERIOUS PROBLEM OF HAPPINESS WAS SOLVED AND BY WHOM BY TWO OUTCASTS FOR GWYNPLAINE
6377-34619-0022 GWYNPLAINE WAS PRESENCE PRESENCE IS THAT PROFOUND MYSTERY WHICH RENDERS THE INVISIBLE WORLD DIVINE AND FROM WHICH RESULTS THAT OTHER MYSTERY CONFIDENCE IN RELIGIONS THIS IS THE ONLY THING WHICH IS IRREDUCIBLE
6377-34619-0023 BUT THIS IRREDUCIBLE THING SUFFICES THE GREAT MOTIVE POWER IS NOT SEEN IT IS FELT GWYNPLAINE WAS THE RELIGION OF DEA SOMETIMES LOST IN HER SENSE OF LOVE TOWARDS HIM SHE KNELT
6377-34619-0024 LIKE A BEAUTIFUL PRIESTESS BEFORE A GNOME IN A PAGODA MADE HAPPY BY HER ADORATION IMAGINE TO YOURSELF AN ABYSS AND IN ITS CENTRE AN OASIS OF LIGHT AND IN THIS OASIS
6377-34619-0025 TWO CREATURES SHUT OUT OF LIFE DAZZLING EACH OTHER NO PURITY COULD BE COMPARED TO THEIR LOVES
6377-34619-0026 THOUGH PERHAPS SHE DESIRED IT BECAUSE BLINDNESS ESPECIALLY IN A WOMAN HAS ITS DREAMS AND THOUGH TREMBLING AT THE APPROACHES OF THE UNKNOWN DOES NOT FEAR THEM ALL AS TO GWYNPLAINE HIS SENSITIVE YOUTH MADE HIM PENSIVE
6377-34619-0027 THE MORE DELIRIOUS HE FELT THE MORE TIMID HE BECAME HE MIGHT HAVE DARED ANYTHING WITH THIS COMPANION OF HIS EARLY YOUTH WITH THIS CREATURE AS INNOCENT OF FAULT AS OF THE LIGHT WITH THIS BLIND GIRL WHO SAW BUT ONE THING
6377-34619-0028 THAT SHE ADORED HIM BUT HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT A THEFT TO TAKE WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE GIVEN SO HE RESIGNED HIMSELF WITH A MELANCHOLY SATISFACTION TO LOVE ANGELICALLY AND THE CONVICTION OF HIS DEFORMITY
6377-34619-0029 RESOLVED ITSELF INTO A PROUD PURITY THESE HAPPY CREATURES DWELT IN THE IDEAL THEY WERE SPOUSES IN IT AT DISTANCES AS OPPOSITE AS THE SPHERES THEY EXCHANGED IN ITS FIRMAMENT
6377-34619-0030 THE DEEP EFFLUVIUM WHICH IS IN INFINITY ATTRACTION AND ON EARTH THE SEXES
6377-34619-0031 WERE THE KISSES OF SOULS THEY HAD ALWAYS LIVED A COMMON LIFE THEY KNEW THEMSELVES ONLY IN EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY THE INFANCY OF DEA HAD COINCIDED WITH THE YOUTH OF GWYNPLAINE
6377-34619-0032 THEY HAD GROWN UP SIDE BY SIDE FOR A LONG TIME THEY HAD SLEPT IN THE SAME BED FOR THE HUT WAS NOT A LARGE BEDCHAMBER
6377-34619-0033 GWYNPLAINE FELT HIMSELF GROWN UP AND IT WAS IN THE YOUTH THAT SHAME AROSE HE SAID TO URSUS I WILL ALSO SLEEP ON THE FLOOR AND AT NIGHT HE STRETCHED HIMSELF WITH THE OLD MAN ON THE BEAR SKIN
6377-34619-0034 SHE CRIED FOR HER BED FELLOW BUT GWYNPLAINE BECOME RESTLESS BECAUSE HE HAD BEGUN TO LOVE DECIDED TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS FROM THAT TIME HE ALWAYS SLEPT BY THE SIDE OF URSUS ON THE PLANKS IN THE SUMMER
6377-34619-0035 WHEN THE NIGHTS WERE FINE HE SLEPT OUTSIDE WITH HOMO WHEN THIRTEEN DEA HAD NOT YET BECOME RESIGNED TO THE ARRANGEMENT OFTEN IN THE EVENING SHE SAID GWYNPLAINE COME CLOSE TO ME
6377-34619-0036 THAT WILL PUT ME TO SLEEP A MAN LYING BY HER SIDE WAS A NECESSITY TO HER INNOCENT SLUMBERS
6377-34619-0037 SHE IGNORED NUDITY
6377-34619-0038 DEA UNTAUGHT MADE GWYNPLAINE WILD SOMETIMES IT HAPPENED THAT DEA WHEN ALMOST REACHING YOUTH COMBED HER LONG HAIR AS SHE SAT ON HER BED
6377-34619-0039 AND WOULD CALL GWYNPLAINE GWYNPLAINE BLUSHED LOWERED HIS EYES AND KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO IN PRESENCE OF THIS INNOCENT CREATURE STAMMERING HE TURNED HIS HEAD FEARED AND FLED
6377-34619-0040 THE DAPHNIS OF DARKNESS TOOK FLIGHT BEFORE THE CHLOE OF SHADOW
