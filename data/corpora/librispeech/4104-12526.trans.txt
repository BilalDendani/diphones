4104-12526-0000 IN WHAT IS NOW WESTERN NEBRASKA THERE WAS SOME RELIEF FROM THE DUST THE THRONG WAS VISIBLY THINNED OUT SOME HAD PUSHED ON BEYOND THE CONGESTED DISTRICT WHILE OTHERS HAD LAGGED BEHIND
4104-12526-0001 THE DEAD TOO HAD LEFT ROOM UPON THE ROAD WHEN WE REACHED THE HIGHER LANDS OF WYOMING OUR TRAVELING BECAME STILL MORE PLEASANT THE NIGHTS WERE COOLER AND WE HAD CLEARER PURER WATER
4104-12526-0002 AS WE GRADUALLY ASCENDED THE SWEETWATER LIFE GREW MORE TOLERABLE AND DISCOMFORT LESS ACUTE WE WERE NOW NEARING THE CREST OF THE CONTINENT THE CLIMB WAS SO GRADUAL HOWEVER
4104-12526-0003 AS TO BE HARDLY OBSERVABLE THE SUMMIT OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS THROUGH THE SOUTH PASS PRESENTS A WIDE OPEN UNDULATING COUNTRY THE PASS OFFERS THEREFORE AN EASY GATEWAY TO THE WEST
4104-12526-0004 PASSING PACIFIC SPRINGS AT THE SUMMIT WE ROLLED OVER TO BIG SANDY CREEK
4104-12526-0005 AND TOOK THE SUBLETTE CUT OFF OVER TO BEAR RIVER THIS WAS A SHORTER TRAIL TO THE OREGON COUNTRY
4104-12526-0006 STEAMBOAT SPRING WAS SPOUTING AT REGULAR INTERVALS AS WE PASSED JUST AFTER LEAVING SODA SPRINGS OUR LITTLE COMPANY OF FRIENDS SEPARATED
4104-12526-0007 THE MC AULEYS AND WILLIAM BUCK TOOK THE TRAIL TO CALIFORNIA WHILE WITH OLIVER AND THE DAVENPORT BROTHERS WE WENT NORTHWEST TO OREGON JACOB THE YOUNGER OF THE BROTHERS
4104-12526-0008 FELL SICK AND GRADUALLY GREW WORSE AS THE JOURNEY GREW HARDER SHORTLY AFTER REACHING PORTLAND THE POOR BOY DIED THOMAS MC AULEY SETTLED IN THE HOBART HILLS IN CALIFORNIA AND BECAME A RESPECTED CITIZEN OF THAT STATE
4104-12526-0009 HE WAS EIGHTY EIGHT YEARS OLD WILLIAM BUCK HAS LONG SINCE LAIN DOWN TO REST A FEW YEARS AFTER WE HAD PARTED ON THE BIG BEND OF THE BEAR RIVER
4104-12526-0010 AS WE THEN CALLED THE EASTERN PART OF OUR COUNTRY AND RETURNING TO CALIFORNIA BY WAY OF THE ISTHMUS OF PANAMA HE HAD BROUGHT FIFTY SWARMS OF BEES THREE OF THESE SWARMS HE SENT UP TO ME IN WASHINGTON
4104-12526-0011 AS FAR AS I KNOW THESE WERE THE FIRST HONEY BEES IN THAT STATE WILLIAM BUCK WAS A MAN WHO WAS ALWAYS DOING A GOOD TURN FOR HIS FRIENDS WHEN SNAKE RIVER WAS REACHED AND IN FACT EVEN BEFORE THAT
4104-12526-0012 THE HEAT AGAIN BECAME OPPRESSIVE THE DUST STIFLING AND THE THIRST AT TIMES ALMOST MADDENING IN SOME PLACES WE COULD SEE THE WATER OF THE SNAKE WINDING THROUGH THE LAVA GORGES BUT WE COULD NOT REACH IT
4104-12526-0013 AS THE RIVER RAN IN THE INACCESSIBLE DEPTHS OF THE CANYON SICKNESS AGAIN BECAME PREVALENT AND ANOTHER OUTBREAK OF CHOLERA CLAIMED MANY VICTIMS THERE WERE BUT FEW FERRIES AND NONE AT ALL IN MANY PLACES WHERE CROSSINGS WERE TO BE MADE
4104-12526-0014 EVEN WHERE THERE WAS A FERRY THE CHARGES WERE SO HIGH THAT THEY WERE OUT OF REACH OF MOST OF THE EMIGRANTS AS FOR ME ALL MY FUNDS HAD BEEN ABSORBED IN PROCURING MY OUTFIT AT EDDYVILLE IN IOWA
4104-12526-0015 WE HAD NOT DREAMED THAT THERE WOULD BE USE FOR MONEY ON THE PLAINS WHERE THERE WERE NEITHER SUPPLIES NOR PEOPLE BUT WE SOON FOUND OUT OUR MISTAKE THE CROSSING OF THE SNAKE RIVER ALTHOUGH LATE IN THE JOURNEY
4104-12526-0016 GAVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEND MATTERS ABOUT THIRTY MILES BELOW SALMON FALLS THE DILEMMA CONFRONTED US OF EITHER CROSSING THE SNAKE RIVER OR HAVING OUR TEAMS STARVE ON THE TRIP DOWN THE RIVER ON THE SOUTH BANK
4104-12526-0017 WE FOUND THAT SOME EMIGRANTS HAD CALKED TWO WAGON BEDS AND LASHED THEM TOGETHER AND WERE USING THIS CRAFT FOR CROSSING BUT THEY WOULD NOT HELP OTHERS ACROSS FOR LESS THAN THREE TO FIVE DOLLARS A WAGON
4104-12526-0018 THE PARTY SWIMMING THEIR OWN STOCK IF OTHERS COULD CROSS IN WAGON BEDS WHY COULDN'T WE DO LIKEWISE WITHOUT MORE ADO ALL THE OLD CLOTHING THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE SPARED WAS ASSEMBLED AND TAR BUCKETS WERE SCRAPED
4104-12526-0019 OLD CHISELS AND BROKEN KNIVES WERE HUNTED UP AND A BOAT REPAIRING AND CALKING CAMPAIGN BEGAN VERY SOON THE WAGON BOX RODE PLACIDLY EVEN IF NOT GRACEFULLY ON THE WATERS OF THE SNAKE RIVER
4104-12526-0020 NOW SERVED ME WELL I COULD ROW A BOAT MY FIRST VENTURE ACROSS THE SNAKE RIVER WAS WITH THE WAGON GEAR RUN OVER THE WAGON BOX THE WHOLE BEING GRADUALLY WORKED OUT INTO DEEP WATER THE LOAD WAS SO HEAVY
4104-12526-0021 THAT A VERY SMALL MARGIN WAS LEFT TO PREVENT THE WATER FROM BREAKING OVER THE SIDES AND SOME WATER DID ENTER AS LIGHT RIPPLES ON THE SURFACE STRUCK THE MARY JANE FOR WE HAD DULY NAMED OUR CRAFT I GOT OVER SAFELY
4104-12526-0022 BUT AFTER THAT I TOOK LIGHTER LOADS AND I REALLY ENJOYED THE WORK WITH THE CHANGE FROM THE INTOLERABLE DUST TO THE CLEAR ATMOSPHERE OF THE RIVER SOME PEOPLE WERE SO INFATUATED WITH THE IDEA OF FLOATING ON THE WATER
4104-12526-0023 THAT THEY WERE EASILY PERSUADED BY AN UNPRINCIPLED TRADER AT THE LOWER CROSSING TO DISPOSE OF THEIR TEAMS FOR A SONG AND TO EMBARK IN THEIR WAGON BEDS FOR A VOYAGE DOWN THE RIVER
4104-12526-0024 AND SOME EVEN LOST THEIR LIVES AFTER TERRIBLE HARDSHIPS THE SURVIVORS REACHED THE ROAD AGAIN TO BECOME OBJECTS OF CHARITY I KNEW ONE SURVIVOR WHO WAS OUT SEVEN DAYS WITHOUT FOOD
4104-12526-0025 OTHER THAN A SCANT SUPPLY OF BERRIES AND VEGETABLE GROWTH AND
4104-12526-0026 WE HAD NO TROUBLE TO GET THE CATTLE ACROSS ALTHOUGH THE RIVER WAS WIDE DANDY WOULD DO ALMOST ANYTHING I ASKED OF HIM SO LEADING HIM TO THE WATER'S EDGE WITH A LITTLE COAXING I GOT HIM INTO SWIMMING WATER
4104-12526-0027 AND GUIDED HIM ACROSS WITH THE WAGON BED THE OTHERS ALL FOLLOWED HAVING BEEN DRIVEN INTO DEEP WATER AFTER THE LEADER IT SEEMS ALMOST INCREDIBLE HOW PASSIVELY OBEDIENT CATTLE WILL BECOME AFTER LONG TRAINING ON SUCH A JOURNEY
4104-12526-0028 INDEED THE OX IS ALWAYS PATIENT AND USUALLY QUITE OBEDIENT BUT WHEN OXEN GET HEATED AND THIRSTY THEY BECOME HEADSTRONG AND RECKLESS AND WON'T OBEY
4104-12526-0029 I HAVE KNOWN THEM TO TAKE OFF THE ROAD TO A WATER HOLE WHEN APPARENTLY NOTHING COULD STOP THEM TILL THEY HAD GONE SO FAR INTO THE MUD AND WATER THAT IT WAS A HARD JOB FOR THEM TO GET OUT AGAIN
4104-12526-0030 WE HAD NOT FINISHED CROSSING WHEN TEMPTING OFFERS CAME FROM OTHERS TO CROSS THEM BUT ALL OUR PARTY SAID NO WE MUST TRAVEL THE RULE HAD BEEN ADOPTED TO TRAVEL SOME DISTANCE EVERY DAY THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE
4104-12526-0031 WAS THE WATCHWORD AND NOTHING COULD DIVERT US FROM THAT RESOLUTION ON THE THIRD DAY WE WERE READY TO PULL OUT FROM THE RIVER WITH THE CATTLE RESTED BY THE ENFORCED WAIT
4104-12526-0032 NOW THE QUESTION WAS WHAT ABOUT THE LOWER CROSSING THOSE WHO HAD CROSSED OVER THE RIVER MUST SOMEHOW GET BACK IT WAS LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES TO THE PLACE WHERE WE MUST AGAIN CROSS TO THE SOUTH SIDE
4104-12526-0033 THE LEFT BANK OF THE RIVER I COULD WALK THAT DISTANCE IN THREE DAYS WHILE IT WOULD TAKE OUR TEAMS TEN COULD I GO ON AHEAD PROCURE A WAGON BOX AND START A FERRY OF MY OWN
4104-12526-0034 THE THOUGHT BROUGHT AN AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER AT ONCE WITH ONLY FOOD AND A SMALL BLANKET FOR LOAD I WALKED TO THE LOWER CROSSING IT MAY BE LUDICROUS BUT IT IS TRUE
4104-12526-0035 THAT THE MOST I REMEMBER ABOUT THAT TRAMP IS THE JACK RABBITS SUCH SWARMS AS I TRAVELED DOWN THE BOISE VALLEY
4104-12526-0036 I SOON OBTAINED A WAGON BED AND ALL DAY LONG FOR SEVERAL DAYS I WAS AT WORK CROSSING PEOPLE I CONTINUED AT THIS TILL OUR TEAMS CAME UP AND FOR A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT
4104-12526-0037 I LEFT THE RIVER WITH A HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS IN MY POCKET ALL BUT TWO DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS OF THIS WAS GONE BEFORE I ARRIVED IN PORTLAND BUT WE COULD NOT DELAY LONGER EVEN TO MAKE MONEY
4104-12526-0038 I THOUGHT I COULD SEE SIGNS OF FAILING STRENGTH IN MY YOUNG WIFE AND THE BABY NOT FOR MOUNTAINS OF GOLD WOULD WE JEOPARDIZE THEIR LIVES ALL ALONG THE WAY THE BABY AND THE LITTLE MOTHER HAD BEEN TENDERLY CARED FOR
4104-12526-0039 WE USED TO CLEAR AWAY A SPACE IN THE WAGON BED FOR THEM TO TAKE A NAP TOGETHER THE SLOW SWAYING OF THE WAGON OVER SMOOTH SANDY STRETCHES MADE A ROCK A BY MOVEMENT THAT WOULD LULL THEM OFF TO DREAMLAND AND MAKE THEM FORGET THE WEARY WAY
