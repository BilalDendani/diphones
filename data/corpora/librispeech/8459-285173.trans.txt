8459-285173-0000 DEAR B BELIEVING ONLY A PORTION OF MY FORMER VOLUME TO BE WORTHY A SECOND EDITION THAT SMALL PORTION I THOUGHT IT AS WELL TO INCLUDE IN THE PRESENT BOOK AS TO REPUBLISH BY ITSELF
8459-285173-0001 I HAVE THEREFORE HEREIN COMBINED AL AARAAF AND TAMERLANE WITH OTHER POEMS HITHERTO UNPRINTED NOR HAVE I HESITATED TO INSERT FROM THE MINOR POEMS NOW OMITTED WHOLE LINES AND EVEN PASSAGES TO THE END THAT BEING PLACED IN A FAIRER LIGHT
8459-285173-0002 AND THE TRASH SHAKEN FROM THEM IN WHICH THEY WERE IMBEDDED THEY MAY HAVE SOME CHANCE OF BEING SEEN BY POSTERITY IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT A GOOD CRITIQUE ON A POEM MAY BE WRITTEN BY ONE WHO IS NO POET HIMSELF THIS ACCORDING TO YOUR IDEA AND MINE OF POETRY
8459-285173-0003 I FEEL TO BE FALSE THE LESS POETICAL THE CRITIC THE LESS JUST THE CRITIQUE AND THE CONVERSE ON THIS ACCOUNT
8459-285173-0004 I WOULD BE AS MUCH ASHAMED OF THE WORLD'S GOOD OPINION AS PROUD OF YOUR OWN ANOTHER THAN YOURSELF MIGHT HERE OBSERVE SHAKESPEARE IS IN POSSESSION OF THE WORLD'S GOOD OPINION AND YET SHAKESPEARE IS THE GREATEST OF POETS IT APPEARS THEN THAT THE WORLD JUDGE CORRECTLY
8459-285173-0005 WHY SHOULD YOU BE ASHAMED OF THEIR FAVORABLE JUDGMENT THE DIFFICULTY LIES IN THE INTERPRETATION OF THE WORD JUDGMENT OR OPINION THE OPINION IS THE WORLD'S TRULY BUT
8459-285173-0006 WHOSE HEAD THAT IS TO SAY HIS MORE EXALTED THOUGHT IS TOO FAR ABOVE THE FOOL TO BE SEEN OR UNDERSTOOD BUT WHOSE FEET BY WHICH I MEAN HIS EVERYDAY ACTIONS ARE SUFFICIENTLY NEAR TO BE DISCERNED AND BY MEANS OF WHICH THAT SUPERIORITY IS ASCERTAINED
8459-285173-0007 THIS NEIGHBOR ASSERTS THAT SHAKESPEARE IS A GREAT POET
8459-285173-0008 YOU ARE AWARE OF THE GREAT BARRIER IN THE PATH OF AN AMERICAN WRITER
8459-285173-0009 I SAY ESTABLISHED FOR IT IS WITH LITERATURE AS WITH LAW OR EMPIRE AN ESTABLISHED NAME IS AN ESTATE IN TENURE
8459-285173-0010 BESIDES ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE THAT BOOKS LIKE THEIR AUTHORS IMPROVE BY TRAVEL THEIR HAVING CROSSED THE SEA IS WITH US SO GREAT A DISTINCTION OUR ANTIQUARIES ABANDON TIME FOR DISTANCE OUR VERY FOPS GLANCE FROM THE BINDING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE TITLE PAGE
8459-285173-0011 WHERE THE MYSTIC CHARACTERS WHICH SPELL LONDON PARIS OR GENOA ARE PRECISELY SO MANY LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION I MENTIONED JUST NOW A VULGAR ERROR AS REGARDS CRITICISM I THINK THE NOTION THAT NO POET CAN FORM A CORRECT ESTIMATE OF HIS OWN WRITINGS IS ANOTHER
8459-285173-0012 I REMARKED BEFORE THAT IN PROPORTION TO THE POETICAL TALENT WOULD BE THE JUSTICE OF A CRITIQUE UPON POETRY THEREFORE A BAD POET WOULD I GRANT MAKE A FALSE CRITIQUE AND HIS SELF LOVE WOULD INFALLIBLY BIAS HIS LITTLE JUDGMENT IN HIS FAVOR BUT A POET
8459-285173-0013 WHO IS INDEED A POET COULD NOT I THINK FAIL OF MAKING A JUST CRITIQUE WHATEVER SHOULD BE DEDUCTED ON THE SCORE OF SELF LOVE MIGHT BE REPLACED ON ACCOUNT OF HIS INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SUBJECT IN SHORT WE HAVE MORE INSTANCES OF FALSE CRITICISM
8459-285173-0014 THAN OF JUST WHERE ONE'S OWN WRITINGS ARE THE TEST SIMPLY BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE BAD POETS THAN GOOD THERE ARE OF COURSE MANY OBJECTIONS TO WHAT I SAY MILTON IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE CONTRARY BUT HIS OPINION WITH RESPECT TO THE PARADISE REGAINED
8459-285173-0015 IS BY NO MEANS FAIRLY ASCERTAINED BY WHAT TRIVIAL CIRCUMSTANCES MEN ARE OFTEN LED TO ASSERT WHAT THEY DO NOT REALLY BELIEVE PERHAPS AN INADVERTENT WORD HAS DESCENDED TO POSTERITY
8459-285173-0016 BUT IN FACT THE PARADISE REGAINED IS LITTLE IF AT ALL INFERIOR TO THE PARADISE LOST AND IS ONLY SUPPOSED SO TO BE BECAUSE MEN DO NOT LIKE EPICS WHATEVER THEY MAY SAY TO THE CONTRARY AND READING THOSE OF MILTON IN THEIR NATURAL ORDER
8459-285173-0017 ARE TOO MUCH WEARIED WITH THE FIRST TO DERIVE ANY PLEASURE FROM THE SECOND I DARE SAY MILTON PREFERRED COMUS TO EITHER IF SO JUSTLY AS I AM SPEAKING OF POETRY IT WILL NOT BE AMISS TO TOUCH SLIGHTLY UPON THE MOST SINGULAR HERESY IN ITS MODERN HISTORY
8459-285173-0018 THE HERESY OF WHAT IS CALLED VERY FOOLISHLY THE LAKE SCHOOL SOME YEARS AGO I MIGHT HAVE BEEN INDUCED BY AN OCCASION LIKE THE PRESENT TO ATTEMPT A FORMAL REFUTATION OF THEIR DOCTRINE AT PRESENT IT WOULD BE A WORK OF SUPEREROGATION
8459-285173-0019 THE WISE MUST BOW TO THE WISDOM OF SUCH MEN AS COLERIDGE AND SOUTHEY BUT BEING WISE HAVE LAUGHED AT POETICAL THEORIES SO PROSAICALLY EXEMPLIFLED ARISTOTLE WITH SINGULAR ASSURANCE HAS DECLARED POETRY THE MOST PHILOSOPHICAL OF ALL WRITINGS
8459-285173-0020 HE SEEMS TO THINK THAT THE END OF POETRY IS OR SHOULD BE INSTRUCTION YET IT IS A TRUISM THAT THE END OF OUR EXISTENCE IS HAPPINESS IF SO THE END OF EVERY SEPARATE PART OF OUR EXISTENCE EVERYTHING CONNECTED WITH OUR EXISTENCE SHOULD BE STILL HAPPINESS
8459-285173-0021 YET WE SEE THE ABOVE MENTIONED OPINION IMPLIES PRECISELY THE REVERSE TO PROCEED CETERIS PARIBUS HE WHO PLEASES IS OF MORE IMPORTANCE TO HIS FELLOW MEN THAN HE WHO INSTRUCTS SINCE UTILITY IS HAPPINESS
8459-285173-0022 AND PLEASURE IS THE END ALREADY OBTAINED WHICH INSTRUCTION IS MERELY THE MEANS OF OBTAINING I SEE NO REASON THEN WHY OUR METAPHYSICAL POETS SHOULD PLUME THEMSELVES SO MUCH ON THE UTILITY OF THEIR WORKS UNLESS INDEED THEY REFER TO INSTRUCTION WITH ETERNITY IN VIEW
8459-285173-0023 IN SUCH CASE I SHOULD NO DOUBT BE TEMPTED TO THINK OF THE DEVIL IN MELMOTH WHO LABORS INDEFATIGABLY
8459-285173-0024 TO ACCOMPLISH THE DESTRUCTION OF ONE OR TWO SOULS WHILE ANY COMMON DEVIL WOULD HAVE DEMOLISHED ONE OR TWO THOUSAND AGAINST THE SUBTLETIES WHICH WOULD MAKE POETRY A STUDY NOT A PASSION IT BECOMES THE METAPHYSICIAN TO REASON BUT THE POET TO PROTEST
8459-285173-0025 YET WORDSWORTH AND COLERIDGE ARE MEN IN YEARS THE ONE IMBUED IN CONTEMPLATION FROM HIS CHILDHOOD THE OTHER A GIANT IN INTELLECT AND LEARNING THE DIFFIDENCE THEN
8459-285173-0026 THAT LEARNING HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH THE IMAGINATION INTELLECT WITH THE PASSIONS OR AGE WITH POETRY TRIFLES LIKE STRAWS UPON THE SURFACE FLOW HE WHO WOULD SEARCH FOR PEARLS MUST DIVE BELOW
8459-285173-0027 AS REGARDS THE GREATER TRUTHS MEN OFTENER ERR BY SEEKING THEM AT THE BOTTOM THAN AT THE TOP TRUTH LIES IN THE HUGE ABYSSES WHERE WISDOM IS SOUGHT NOT IN THE PALPABLE PALACES WHERE SHE IS FOUND THE ANCIENTS WERE NOT ALWAYS RIGHT IN HIDING
8459-285173-0028 THE GODDESS IN A WELL WITNESS THE LIGHT WHICH BACON HAS THROWN UPON PHILOSOPHY WITNESS THE PRINCIPLES OF OUR DIVINE FAITH THAT MORAL MECHANISM BY WHICH THE SIMPLICITY OF A CHILD MAY OVERBALANCE THE WISDOM OF A MAN WE SEE AN INSTANCE OF COLERIDGE'S LIABILITY TO ERR IN HIS
8459-285173-0029 BIOGRAPHIA LITERARIA' PROFESSEDLY HIS LITERARY LIFE AND OPINIONS BUT IN FACT A TREATISE DE OMNI SCIBILI ET QUIBUSDAM ALIIS HE GOES WRONG BY REASON OF HIS VERY PROFUNDITY AND OF HIS ERROR WE HAVE A NATURAL TYPE IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF A STAR
8459-285173-0030 AS TO WORDSWORTH I HAVE NO FAITH IN HIM THAT HE HAD IN YOUTH THE FEELINGS OF A POET I BELIEVE FOR THERE ARE GLIMPSES OF EXTREME DELICACY IN HIS WRITINGS AND DELICACY IS THE POET'S OWN KINGDOM HIS EL DORADO
8459-285173-0031 BUT THEY HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF A BETTER DAY RECOLLECTED AND GLIMPSES AT BEST ARE LITTLE EVIDENCE OF PRESENT POETIC FIRE WE KNOW THAT A FEW STRAGGLING FLOWERS SPRING UP DAILY IN THE CREVICES OF THE GLACIER
8459-285173-0032 HE WAS TO BLAME IN WEARING AWAY HIS YOUTH IN CONTEMPLATION WITH THE END OF POETIZING IN HIS MANHOOD WITH THE INCREASE OF HIS JUDGMENT THE LIGHT WHICH SHOULD MAKE IT APPARENT HAS FADED AWAY HIS JUDGMENT CONSEQUENTLY IS TOO CORRECT THIS MAY NOT BE UNDERSTOOD
8459-285173-0033 THE LONG WORDY DISCUSSIONS BY WHICH HE TRIES TO REASON US INTO ADMIRATION OF HIS POETRY SPEAK VERY LITTLE IN HIS FAVOR THEY ARE FULL OF SUCH ASSERTIONS AS THIS I HAVE OPENED ONE OF HIS VOLUMES AT RANDOM
8459-285173-0034 AND WHAT WAS NEVER DONE BEFORE INDEED THEN IT FOLLOWS THAT IN DOING WHAT IS UNWORTHY TO BE DONE OR WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE NO GENIUS CAN BE EVINCED YET THE PICKING OF POCKETS IS AN UNWORTHY ACT POCKETS HAVE BEEN PICKED TIME IMMEMORIAL AND BARRINGTON THE PICKPOCKET IN POINT OF GENIUS
8459-285173-0035 THE POET AGAIN IN ESTIMATING THE MERIT OF CERTAIN POEMS
8459-285173-0036 CAN SURELY BE OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE YET IN ORDER TO PROVE THEIR WORTHLESSNESS MISTER W HAS EXPENDED MANY PAGES IN THE CONTROVERSY
8459-285173-0037 BUT WORSE STILL THAT HE MAY BEAR DOWN EVERY ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF THESE POEMS HE TRIUMPHANTLY DRAGS FORWARD A PASSAGE IN HIS ABOMINATION WITH WHICH HE EXPECTS THE READER TO SYMPATHIZE
8459-285173-0038 THIS WILLIAM WORDSWORTH THE AUTHOR OF PETER BELL HAS SELECTED FOR HIS CONTEMPT
8459-285173-0039 HAS TO OFFER IMPRIMIS AND NOW SHE'S AT THE PONY'S TAIL AND NOW SHE'S AT THE PONY'S HEAD ON THAT SIDE NOW AND NOW ON THIS AND ALMOST STIFLED WITH HER BLISS A FEW SAD TEARS DOES BETTY SHED
8459-285173-0040 SHE PATS THE PONY WHERE OR WHEN SHE KNOWS NOT HAPPY BETTY FOY OH JOHNNY NEVER MIND THE DOCTOR SECONDLY THE DEW WAS FALLING FAST THE STARS BEGAN TO BLINK I HEARD A VOICE IT SAID DRINK
8459-285173-0041 PRETTY CREATURE DRINK AND LOOKING O'ER THE HEDGE
8459-285173-0042 A SNOW WHITE MOUNTAIN LAMB WITH A MAIDEN AT ITS SIDE NO OTHER SHEEP WAS NEAR THE LAMB WAS ALL ALONE AND BY A SLENDER CORD WAS TETHER'D TO A STONE NOW WE HAVE NO DOUBT THIS IS ALL TRUE WE WILL BELIEVE IT INDEED WE WILL MISTER W
8459-285173-0043 IS IT SYMPATHY FOR THE SHEEP YOU WISH TO EXCITE I LOVE A SHEEP FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART BUT THERE ARE OCCASIONS DEAR B THERE ARE OCCASIONS WHEN EVEN WORDSWORTH IS REASONABLE EVEN STAMBOUL IT IS SAID SHALL HAVE AN END
8459-285173-0044 AND THE BEE SOPHOCLES HAS TRANSMITTED TO ETERNITY A SORE TOE
8459-285173-0045 WHAT IS POETRY POETRY THAT PROTEUS LIKE IDEA WITH AS MANY APPELLATIONS AS THE NINE TITLED CORCYRA GIVE ME I DEMANDED OF A SCHOLAR SOME TIME AGO GIVE ME A DEFINITION OF POETRY
8459-285173-0046 AND HE PROCEEDED TO HIS LIBRARY BROUGHT ME A DOCTOR JOHNSON AND OVERWHELMED ME WITH A DEFINITION SHADE OF THE IMMORTAL SHAKESPEARE I IMAGINE TO MYSELF THE SCOWL OF YOUR SPIRITUAL EYE UPON THE PROFANITY OF THAT SCURRILOUS URSA MAJOR THINK OF POETRY DEAR B
8459-285173-0047 THINK OF ALL THAT IS AIRY AND FAIRY LIKE AND THEN OF ALL THAT IS HIDEOUS AND UNWIELDY THINK OF HIS HUGE BULK THE ELEPHANT AND THEN AND THEN THINK OF THE TEMPEST' THE MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM' PROSPERO OBERON AND TITANIA
8459-285173-0048 BEING A POEM ONLY SO FAR AS THIS OBJECT IS ATTAINED ROMANCE PRESENTING PERCEPTIBLE IMAGES WITH DEFINITE POETRY WITH INDEFINITE SENSATIONS TO WHICH END MUSIC IS AN ESSENTIAL SINCE THE COMPREHENSION OF SWEET SOUND IS OUR MOST INDEFINITE CONCEPTION
8459-285173-0049 MUSIC WHEN COMBINED WITH A PLEASURABLE IDEA IS POETRY MUSIC WITHOUT THE IDEA IS SIMPLY MUSIC THE IDEA WI THOUT THE MUSIC IS PROSE FROM ITS VERY DEFINITIVENESS WHAT WAS MEANT BY THE INVECTIVE AGAINST HIM WHO HAD NO MUSIC IN HIS SOUL
