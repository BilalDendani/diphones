1681-142313-0000 SHE BEGAN TO WALK BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN HER OLD HABITUAL WAY OF SHOWING AGITATION BUT THEN REMEMBERING THAT IN THAT SLIGHTLY BUILT HOUSE EVERY STEP WAS HEARD FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER SHE SATE DOWN UNTIL SHE HEARD MISSUS THORNTON GO SAFELY OUT OF THE HOUSE
1681-142313-0001 SPEECH BY SPEECH SHE COMPELLED HER MEMORY TO GO THROUGH WITH IT AT THE END SHE ROSE UP AND SAID TO HERSELF IN A MELANCHOLY TONE AT ANY RATE HER WORDS DO NOT TOUCH ME THEY FALL OFF FROM ME
1681-142313-0002 FOR I AM INNOCENT OF ALL THE MOTIVES SHE ATTRIBUTES TO ME BUT STILL IT IS HARD TO THINK THAT ANY ONE ANY WOMAN CAN BELIEVE ALL THIS OF ANOTHER SO EASILY IT IS HARD AND SAD WHERE I HAVE DONE WRONG SHE DOES NOT ACCUSE ME SHE DOES NOT KNOW
1681-142313-0003 HE NEVER TOLD HER I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN HE WOULD NOT SHE LIFTED UP HER HEAD AS IF SHE TOOK PRIDE IN ANY DELICACY OF FEELING WHICH MISTER THORNTON HAD SHOWN THEN AS A NEW THOUGHT CAME ACROSS HER SHE PRESSED HER HANDS TIGHTLY TOGETHER
1681-142313-0004 HE TOO MUST TAKE POOR FREDERICK FOR SOME LOVER SHE BLUSHED AS THE WORD PASSED THROUGH HER MIND I SEE IT NOW IT IS NOT MERELY THAT HE KNOWS OF MY FALSEHOOD BUT HE BELIEVES THAT SOME ONE ELSE CARES FOR ME AND THAT I OH DEAR
1681-142313-0005 OH DEAR WHAT SHALL I DO WHAT DO I MEAN WHY DO I CARE WHAT HE THINKS BEYOND THE MERE LOSS OF HIS GOOD OPINION AS REGARDS MY TELLING THE TRUTH OR NOT I CANNOT TELL BUT I AM VERY MISERABLE OH HOW UNHAPPY THIS LAST YEAR HAS BEEN
1681-142313-0006 I HAVE PASSED OUT OF CHILDHOOD INTO OLD AGE I HAVE HAD NO YOUTH NO WOMANHOOD THE HOPES OF WOMANHOOD HAVE CLOSED FOR ME FOR I SHALL NEVER MARRY AND I ANTICIPATE CARES AND SORROWS
1681-142313-0007 JUST AS IF I WERE AN OLD WOMAN AND WITH THE SAME FEARFUL SPIRIT I AM WEARY OF THIS CONTINUAL CALL UPON ME FOR STRENGTH I COULD BEAR UP FOR PAPA BECAUSE THAT IS A NATURAL PIOUS DUTY AND I THINK I COULD BEAR UP AGAINST
1681-142313-0008 AT ANY RATE I COULD HAVE THE ENERGY TO RESENT MISSUS THORNTON'S UNJUST IMPERTINENT SUSPICIONS BUT IT IS HARD TO FEEL HOW COMPLETELY HE MUST MISUNDERSTAND ME WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO MAKE ME SO MORBID TO DAY I DO NOT KNOW
1681-142313-0009 I ONLY KNOW I CANNOT HELP IT I MUST GIVE WAY SOMETIMES NO I WILL NOT THOUGH SAID SHE SPRINGING TO HER FEET I WILL NOT I WILL NOT THINK OF MYSELF AND MY OWN POSITION I WON'T EXAMINE INTO MY OWN FEELINGS
1681-142313-0010 IT WOULD BE OF NO USE NOW SOME TIME IF I LIVE TO BE AN OLD WOMAN I MAY SIT OVER THE FIRE AND LOOKING INTO THE EMBERS SEE THE LIFE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALL THIS TIME SHE WAS HASTILY PUTTING ON HER THINGS TO GO OUT
1681-142313-0011 ONLY STOPPING FROM TIME TO TIME TO WIPE HER EYES WITH AN IMPATIENCE OF GESTURE AT THE TEARS THAT WOULD COME IN SPITE OF ALL HER BRAVERY I DARE SAY THERE'S MANY A WOMAN MAKES AS SAD A MISTAKE AS I HAVE DONE AND ONLY FINDS IT OUT TOO LATE
1681-142313-0012 AND HOW PROUDLY AND IMPERTINENTLY I SPOKE TO HIM THAT DAY BUT I DID NOT KNOW THEN IT HAS COME UPON ME LITTLE BY LITTLE AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT BEGAN NOW I WON'T GIVE WAY
1681-142313-0013 I SHALL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BEHAVE IN THE SAME WAY TO HIM WITH THIS MISERABLE CONSCIOUSNESS UPON ME BUT I WILL BE VERY CALM AND VERY QUIET AND SAY VERY LITTLE BUT TO BE SURE I MAY NOT SEE HIM HE KEEPS OUT OF OUR WAY EVIDENTLY THAT WOULD BE WORSE THAN ALL
1681-142313-0014 AND YET NO WONDER THAT HE AVOIDS ME BELIEVING WHAT HE MUST ABOUT ME SHE WENT OUT GOING RAPIDLY TOWARDS THE COUNTRY AND TRYING TO DROWN REFLECTION BY SWIFTNESS OF MOTION AS SHE STOOD ON THE DOOR STEP AT HER RETURN HER FATHER CAME UP
1681-142313-0015 GOOD GIRL SAID HE YOU'VE BEEN TO MISSUS BOUCHER'S I WAS JUST MEANING TO GO THERE IF I HAD TIME BEFORE DINNER NO PAPA I HAVE NOT SAID MARGARET REDDENING I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT HER BUT I WILL GO DIRECTLY AFTER DINNER I WILL GO WHILE YOU ARE TAKING YOUR NAP
1681-142313-0016 ACCORDINGLY MARGARET WENT MISSUS BOUCHER WAS VERY ILL REALLY ILL NOT MERELY AILING THE KIND AND SENSIBLE NEIGHBOUR WHO HAD COME IN THE OTHER DAY SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING SOME OF THE CHILDREN WERE GONE TO THE NEIGHBOURS
1681-142313-0017 MARY HIGGINS HAD COME FOR THE THREE YOUNGEST AT DINNER TIME AND SINCE THEN NICHOLAS HAD GONE FOR THE DOCTOR HE HAD NOT COME AS YET MISSUS BOUCHER WAS DYING AND THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT TO WAIT MARGARET THOUGHT THAT SHE SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HIS OPINION
1681-142313-0018 AND THAT SHE COULD NOT DO BETTER THAN GO AND SEE THE HIGGINSES IN THE MEANTIME SHE MIGHT THEN POSSIBLY HEAR WHETHER NICHOLAS HAD BEEN ABLE TO MAKE HIS APPLICATION TO MISTER THORNTON SHE FOUND NICHOLAS BUSILY ENGAGED IN MAKING A PENNY SPIN ON THE DRESSER FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THREE LITTLE CHILDREN
1681-142313-0019 WHO WERE CLINGING TO HIM IN A FEARLESS MANNER HE AS WELL AS THEY WAS SMILING AT A GOOD LONG SPIN AND MARGARET THOUGHT THAT THE HAPPY LOOK OF INTEREST IN HIS OCCUPATION WAS A GOOD SIGN WHEN THE PENNY STOPPED SPINNING LILE JOHNNIE BEGAN TO CRY
1681-142313-0020 COME TO ME SAID MARGARET TAKING HIM OFF THE DRESSER AND HOLDING HIM IN HER ARMS SHE HELD HER WATCH TO HIS EAR WHILE SHE ASKED NICHOLAS IF HE HAD SEEN MISTER THORNTON THE LOOK ON HIS FACE CHANGED INSTANTLY AY SAID HE I'VE SEEN AND HEERD TOO MUCH ON HIM
1681-142313-0021 HE REFUSED YOU THEN SAID MARGARET SORROWFULLY TO BE SURE I KNEW HE'D DO IT ALL LONG IT'S NO GOOD EXPECTING MARCY AT THE HANDS O THEM MEASTERS YO'RE A STRANGER AND A FOREIGNER AND AREN'T LIKELY TO KNOW THEIR WAYS BUT I KNOWED IT I AM SORRY I ASKED YOU
1681-142313-0022 WAS HE ANGRY HE DID NOT SPEAK TO YOU AS HAMPER DID DID HE HE WEREN'T O'ER CIVIL SAID NICHOLAS SPINNING THE PENNY AGAIN AS MUCH FOR HIS OWN AMUSEMENT AS FOR THAT OF THE CHILDREN NEVER YO FRET I'M ONLY WHERE I WAS I'LL GO ON TRAMP TO MORROW
1681-142313-0023 I GAVE HIM AS GOOD AS I GOT I TELLED HIM I'D NOT THAT GOOD OPINION ON HIM THAT I'D HA COME A SECOND TIME OF MYSEL BUT YO'D ADVISED ME FOR TO COME AND I WERE BEHOLDEN TO YO YOU TOLD HIM I SENT YOU I DUNNO IF I CA'D YO BY YOUR NAME I DUNNOT THINK I DID
1681-142313-0024 I SAID A WOMAN WHO KNEW NO BETTER HAD ADVISED ME FOR TO COME AND SEE IF THERE WAS A SOFT PLACE IN HIS HEART AND HE ASKED MARGARET SAID I WERE TO TELL YO TO MIND YO'R OWN BUSINESS THAT'S THE LONGEST SPIN YET MY LADS AND THEM'S CIVIL WORDS TO WHAT HE USED TO ME BUT NE'ER MIND
1681-142313-0025 MARGARET PUT THE STRUGGLING JOHNNIE OUT OF HER ARMS BACK INTO HIS FORMER PLACE ON THE DRESSER I AM SORRY I ASKED YOU TO GO TO MISTER THORNTON'S I AM DISAPPOINTED IN HIM THERE WAS A SLIGHT NOISE BEHIND HER BOTH SHE AND NICHOLAS TURNED ROUND AT THE SAME MOMENT
1681-142313-0026 AND THERE STOOD MISTER THORNTON WITH A LOOK OF DISPLEASED SURPRISE UPON HIS FACE OBEYING HER SWIFT IMPULSE MARGARET PASSED OUT BEFORE HIM SAYING NOT A WORD ONLY BOWING LOW TO HIDE THE SUDDEN PALENESS THAT SHE FELT HAD COME OVER HER FACE
1681-142313-0027 HE BENT EQUALLY LOW IN RETURN AND THEN CLOSED THE DOOR AFTER HER AS SHE HURRIED TO MISSUS BOUCHER'S SHE HEARD THE CLANG AND IT SEEMED TO FILL UP THE MEASURE OF HER MORTIFICATION HE TOO WAS ANNOYED TO FIND HER THERE HE HAD TENDERNESS IN HIS HEART
1681-142313-0028 SOFT PLACE AS NICHOLAS HIGGINS CALLED IT BUT HE HAD SOME PRIDE IN CONCEALING IT HE KEPT IT VERY SACRED AND SAFE AND WAS JEALOUS OF EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT TRIED TO GAIN ADMISSION BUT IF HE DREADED EXPOSURE OF HIS TENDERNESS HE WAS EQUALLY DESIROUS THAT ALL MEN SHOULD RECOGNISE HIS JUSTICE
1681-142313-0029 AND HE FELT THAT HE HAD BEEN UNJUST IN GIVING SO SCORNFUL A HEARING TO ANY ONE WHO HAD WAITED WITH HUMBLE PATIENCE FOR FIVE HOURS TO SPEAK TO HIM THAT THE MAN HAD SPOKEN SAUCILY TO HIM WHEN HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY WAS NOTHING TO MISTER THORNTON HE RATHER LIKED HIM FOR IT
1681-142313-0030 AND HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF HIS OWN IRRITABILITY OF TEMPER AT THE TIME WHICH PROBABLY MADE THEM BOTH QUITS IT WAS THE FIVE HOURS OF WAITING THAT STRUCK MISTER THORNTON HE HAD NOT FIVE HOURS TO SPARE HIMSELF BUT ONE HOUR
1681-142313-0031 TWO HOURS OF HIS HARD PENETRATING INTELLECTUAL AS WELL AS BODILY LABOUR DID HE GIVE UP TO GOING ABOUT COLLECTING EVIDENCE AS TO THE TRUTH OF HIGGINS'S STORY THE NATURE OF HIS CHARACTER THE TENOR OF HIS LIFE HE TRIED NOT TO BE BUT WAS CONVINCED THAT ALL THAT HIGGINS HAD SAID WAS TRUE
1681-142313-0032 AND THEN THE CONVICTION WENT IN AS IF BY SOME SPELL AND TOUCHED THE LATENT TENDERNESS OF HIS HEART THE PATIENCE OF THE MAN THE SIMPLE GENEROSITY OF THE MOTIVE FOR HE HAD LEARNT ABOUT THE QUARREL BETWEEN BOUCHER AND HIGGINS MADE HIM FORGET ENTIRELY THE MERE REASONINGS OF JUSTICE
1681-142313-0033 AND OVERLEAP THEM BY A DIVINER INSTINCT HE CAME TO TELL HIGGINS HE WOULD GIVE HIM WORK AND HE WAS MORE ANNOYED TO FIND MARGARET THERE THAN BY HEARING HER LAST WORDS FOR THEN HE UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE WAS THE WOMAN WHO HAD URGED HIGGINS TO COME TO HIM
1681-142313-0034 AND HE DREADED THE ADMISSION OF ANY THOUGHT OF HER AS A MOTIVE TO WHAT HE WAS DOING SOLELY BECAUSE IT WAS RIGHT SO THAT WAS THE LADY YOU SPOKE OF AS A WOMAN SAID HE INDIGNANTLY TO HIGGINS YOU MIGHT HAVE TOLD ME WHO SHE WAS AND THEN MAYBE YO'D HA SPOKEN OF HER MORE CIVIL THAN YO DID
1681-142313-0035 OF COURSE YOU TOLD THAT TO MISS HALE IN COORSE I DID LEASTWAYS I RECKON I DID I TELLED HER SHE WEREN'T TO MEDDLE AGAIN IN AUGHT THAT CONCERNED YO
1681-142313-0036 MISTER THORNTON HAD A PRETTY GOOD NOTION WHOSE THEY WERE FROM WHAT HE HAD HEARD BUT HE FELT AWKWARD IN TURNING THE CONVERSATION ROUND FROM THIS UNPROMISING BEGINNING THEY'RE NOT MINE AND THEY ARE MINE THEY ARE THE CHILDREN YOU SPOKE OF TO ME THIS MORNING
1681-142313-0037 WHEN YO SAID REPLIED HIGGINS TURNING ROUND WITH ILL SMOTHERED FIERCENESS THAT MY STORY MIGHT BE TRUE OR MIGHT NOT
1681-142313-0038 NO MORE HAVE I I REMEMBER WHAT I SAID I SPOKE TO YOU ABOUT THOSE CHILDREN IN A WAY I HAD NO BUSINESS TO DO I DID NOT BELIEVE YOU I COULD NOT HAVE TAKEN CARE OF ANOTHER MAN'S CHILDREN MYSELF IF HE HAD ACTED TOWARDS ME AS I HEAR BOUCHER DID TOWARDS YOU BUT I KNOW NOW THAT YOU SPOKE TRUTH
1681-142313-0039 I BEG YOUR PARDON HIGGINS DID NOT TURN ROUND OR IMMEDIATELY RESPOND TO THIS BUT WHEN HE DID SPEAK IT WAS IN A SOFTENED TONE ALTHOUGH THE WORDS WERE GRUFF ENOUGH YO'VE NO BUSINESS TO GO PRYING INTO WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN BOUCHER AND ME HE'S DEAD AND I'M SORRY
1681-142313-0040 THAT'S ENOUGH SO IT IS WILL YOU TAKE WORK WITH ME THAT'S WHAT I CAME TO ASK HIGGINS'S OBSTINACY WAVERED RECOVERED STRENGTH AND STOOD FIRM HE WOULD NOT SPEAK MISTER THORNTON WOULD NOT ASK AGAIN HIGGINS'S EYE FELL ON THE CHILDREN
1681-142313-0041 WELL SAID MISTER THORNTON HALF LAUGHING IT WAS NOT MY PROPOSAL THAT WE SHOULD GO TOGETHER BUT THERE'S ONE COMFORT ON YOUR OWN SHOWING WE NEITHER OF US CAN THINK MUCH WORSE OF THE OTHER THAN WE DO NOW THAT'S TRUE SAID HIGGINS REFLECTIVELY
1681-142313-0042 I'VE BEEN THINKING EVER SIN I SAW YOU WHAT A MARCY IT WERE YO DID NA TAKE ME ON FOR THAT I NE'ER SAW A MAN WHOM I COULD LESS ABIDE BUT THAT'S MAYBE BEEN A HASTY JUDGMENT AND WORK'S WORK TO SUCH AS ME SO MEASTER I'LL COME AND WHAT'S MORE I THANK YO AND THAT'S A DEAL FRO ME SAID HE MORE FRANKLY
1681-142313-0043 SUDDENLY TURNING ROUND AND FACING MISTER THORNTON FULLY FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THIS IS A DEAL FROM ME SAID MISTER THORNTON GIVING HIGGINS'S HAND A GOOD GRIP
1681-142313-0044 I'LL HAVE NO LAGGARDS AT MY MILL WHAT FINES WE HAVE WE KEEP PRETTY SHARPLY AND THE FIRST TIME I CATCH YOU MAKING MISCHIEF OFF YOU GO

1681-142313-0046 I SHALL NEED A DEAL O BRAINS TO SETTLE WHERE MY BUSINESS ENDS AND YO'RS BEGINS
1681-142313-0047 SO GOOD AFTERNOON JUST BEFORE MISTER THORNTON CAME UP TO MISSUS BOUCHER'S DOOR MARGARET CAME OUT OF IT SHE DID NOT SEE HIM AND HE FOLLOWED HER FOR SEVERAL YARDS ADMIRING HER LIGHT AND EASY WALK AND HER TALL AND GRACEFUL FIGURE
1681-142313-0048 BUT SUDDENLY THIS SIMPLE EMOTION OF PLEASURE WAS TAINTED POISONED BY JEALOUSY HE WISHED TO OVERTAKE HER AND SPEAK TO HER TO SEE HOW SHE WOULD RECEIVE HIM NOW SHE MUST KNOW HE WAS AWARE OF SOME OTHER ATTACHMENT HE WISHED TOO BUT OF THIS WISH HE WAS RATHER ASHAMED
1681-142313-0049 THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW THAT HE HAD JUSTIFIED HER WISDOM IN SENDING HIGGINS TO HIM TO ASK FOR WORK AND HAD REPENTED HIM OF HIS MORNING'S DECISION HE CAME UP TO HER SHE STARTED ALLOW ME TO SAY MISS HALE THAT YOU WERE RATHER PREMATURE IN EXPRESSING YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT
1681-142313-0050 I HAVE TAKEN HIGGINS ON I AM GLAD OF IT SAID SHE COLDLY HE TELLS ME HE REPEATED TO YOU WHAT I SAID THIS MORNING ABOUT MISTER THORNTON HESITATED MARGARET TOOK IT UP ABOUT WOMEN NOT MEDDLING
1681-142313-0051 YOU HAD A PERFECT RIGHT TO EXPRESS YOUR OPINION WHICH WAS A VERY CORRECT ONE I HAVE NO DOUBT BUT SHE WENT ON A LITTLE MORE EAGERLY HIGGINS DID NOT QUITE TELL YOU THE EXACT TRUTH THE WORD TRUTH REMINDED HER OF HER OWN UNTRUTH AND SHE STOPPED SHORT FEELING EXCEEDINGLY UNCOMFORTABLE
1681-142313-0052 MISTER THORNTON AT FIRST WAS PUZZLED TO ACCOUNT FOR HER SILENCE AND THEN HE REMEMBERED THE LIE SHE HAD TOLD AND ALL THAT WAS FOREGONE THE EXACT TRUTH SAID HE VERY FEW PEOPLE DO SPEAK THE EXACT TRUTH I HAVE GIVEN UP HOPING FOR IT
1681-142313-0053 MISS HALE HAVE YOU NO EXPLANATION TO GIVE ME YOU MUST PERCEIVE WHAT I CANNOT BUT THINK MARGARET WAS SILENT SHE WAS WONDERING WHETHER AN EXPLANATION OF ANY KIND WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH HER LOYALTY TO FREDERICK NAY SAID HE I WILL ASK NO FARTHER
1681-142313-0054 I MAY BE PUTTING TEMPTATION IN YOUR WAY AT PRESENT BELIEVE ME YOUR SECRET IS SAFE WITH ME BUT YOU RUN GREAT RISKS ALLOW ME TO SAY IN BEING SO INDISCREET I AM NOW ONLY SPEAKING AS A FRIEND OF YOUR FATHER'S IF I HAD ANY OTHER THOUGHT OR HOPE OF COURSE THAT IS AT AN END
1681-142313-0055 I AM QUITE DISINTERESTED I AM AWARE OF THAT SAID MARGARET FORCING HERSELF TO SPEAK IN AN INDIFFERENT CARELESS WAY I AM AWARE OF WHAT I MUST APPEAR TO YOU BUT THE SECRET IS ANOTHER PERSON'S AND I CANNOT EXPLAIN IT WITHOUT DOING HIM HARM
1681-142313-0056 MY OWN INTEREST IN YOU IS SIMPLY THAT OF A FRIEND YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE ME MISS HALE BUT IT IS IN SPITE OF THE PERSECUTION I'M AFRAID I THREATENED YOU WITH AT ONE TIME BUT THAT IS ALL GIVEN UP ALL PASSED AWAY YOU BELIEVE ME MISS HALE
1681-142313-0057 YES SAID MARGARET QUIETLY AND SADLY THEN REALLY I DON'T SEE ANY OCCASION FOR US TO GO ON WALKING TOGETHER I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY BUT I SEE WE ARE NOTHING TO EACH OTHER IF YOU'RE QUITE CONVINCED THAT ANY FOOLISH PASSION ON MY PART IS ENTIRELY OVER
1681-142313-0058 I WILL WISH YOU GOOD AFTERNOON HE WALKED OFF VERY HASTILY
1681-142313-0059 AS IF I WERE ALWAYS THINKING THAT HE CARED FOR ME WHEN I KNOW HE DOES NOT HE CANNOT HIS MOTHER WILL HAVE SAID ALL THOSE CRUEL THINGS ABOUT ME TO HIM BUT I WON'T CARE FOR HIM
1681-142313-0060 I SURELY AM MISTRESS ENOUGH OF MYSELF TO CONTROL THIS WILD STRANGE MISERABLE FEELING WHICH TEMPTED ME EVEN TO BETRAY MY OWN DEAR FREDERICK SO THAT I MIGHT BUT REGAIN HIS GOOD OPINION THE GOOD OPINION OF A MAN WHO TAKES SUCH PAINS TO TELL ME THAT I AM NOTHING TO HIM COME POOR LITTLE HEART
1681-142313-0061 BE CHEERY AND BRAVE WE'LL BE A GREAT DEAL TO ONE ANOTHER IF WE ARE THROWN OFF AND LEFT DESOLATE HER FATHER WAS ALMOST STARTLED BY HER MERRIMENT THIS AFTERNOON SHE TALKED INCESSANTLY AND FORCED HER NATURAL HUMOUR TO AN UNUSUAL PITCH
1681-142313-0062 AND IF THERE WAS A TINGE OF BITTERNESS IN MUCH OF WHAT SHE SAID IF HER ACCOUNTS OF THE OLD HARLEY STREET SET WERE A LITTLE SARCASTIC HER FATHER COULD NOT BEAR TO CHECK HER AS HE WOULD HAVE DONE AT ANOTHER TIME FOR HE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER SHAKE OFF HER CARES
1681-142313-0063 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EVENING SHE WAS CALLED DOWN TO SPEAK TO MARY HIGGINS AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK MISTER HALE IMAGINED THAT HE SAW TRACES OF TEARS ON HER CHEEKS BUT THAT COULD NOT BE FOR SHE BROUGHT GOOD NEWS THAT HIGGINS HAD GOT WORK AT MISTER THORNTON'S MILL
1681-142313-0064 HER SPIRITS WERE DAMPED AT ANY RATE AND SHE FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO GO ON TALKING AT ALL MUCH MORE IN THE WILD WAY THAT SHE HAD DONE FOR SOME DAYS HER SPIRITS VARIED STRANGELY AND HER FATHER WAS BEGINNING TO BE ANXIOUS ABOUT HER WHEN NEWS ARRIVED FROM ONE OR TWO QUARTERS
1681-142313-0065 THAT PROMISED SOME CHANGE AND VARIETY FOR HER MISTER HALE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM MISTER BELL IN WHICH THAT GENTLEMAN VOLUNTEERED A VISIT TO THEM AND MISTER HALE IMAGINED THAT THE PROMISED SOCIETY OF HIS OLD OXFORD FRIEND WOULD GIVE AS AGREEABLE A TURN TO MARGARET'S IDEAS AS IT DID TO HIS OWN
1681-142313-0066 MARGARET TRIED TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN WHAT PLEASED HER FATHER BUT SHE WAS TOO LANGUID TO CARE ABOUT ANY MISTER BELL EVEN THOUGH HE WERE TWENTY TIMES HER GODFATHER SHE WAS MORE ROUSED BY A LETTER FROM EDITH FULL OF SYMPATHY ABOUT HER AUNT'S DEATH FULL OF DETAILS ABOUT HERSELF HER HUSBAND AND CHILD
1681-142313-0067 AND AT THE END SAYING THAT AS THE CLIMATE DID NOT SUIT THE BABY AND AS MISSUS SHAW WAS TALKING OF RETURNING TO ENGLAND SHE THOUGHT IT PROBABLE THAT CAPTAIN LENNOX MIGHT SELL OUT AND THAT THEY MIGHT ALL GO AND LIVE AGAIN IN THE OLD HARLEY STREET HOUSE WHICH HOWEVER WOULD SEEM VERY INCOMPLETE WITH OUT MARGARET
1681-142313-0068 MARGARET YEARNED AFTER THAT OLD HOUSE AND THE PLACID TRANQUILLITY OF THAT OLD WELL ORDERED MONOTONOUS LIFE SHE HAD FOUND IT OCCASIONALLY TIRESOME WHILE IT LASTED BUT SINCE THEN SHE HAD BEEN BUFFETED ABOUT AND FELT SO EXHAUSTED BY THIS RECENT STRUGGLE WITH HERSELF
1681-142313-0069 SO SHE BEGAN TO LOOK TOWARDS A LONG VISIT TO THE LENNOXES ON THEIR RETURN TO ENGLAND AS TO A POINT NO NOT OF HOPE BUT OF LEISURE IN WHICH SHE COULD REGAIN HER POWER AND COMMAND OVER HERSELF
1681-142313-0070 AT PRESENT IT SEEMED TO HER AS IF ALL SUBJECTS TENDED TOWARDS MISTER THORNTON AS IF SHE COULD NOT FORGET HIM WITH ALL HER ENDEAVOURS IF SHE WENT TO SEE THE HIGGINSES SHE HEARD OF HIM THERE HER FATHER HAD RESUMED THEIR READINGS TOGETHER AND QUOTED HIS OPINIONS PERPETUALLY
