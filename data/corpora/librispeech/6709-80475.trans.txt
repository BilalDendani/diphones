6709-80475-0000 A GREAT CELEBRATOR BY BILL NYE
6709-80475-0001 THE FORMER HOME OF THOMAS JEFFERSON ALSO HIS GRAVE MONTICELLO IS ABOUT AN HOUR'S RIDE FROM CHARLOTTESVILLE BY DILIGENCE ONE RIDES OVER A ROAD CONSTRUCTED OF RIP RAPS AND BROKEN STONE
6709-80475-0002 OF A LONG WAISTED MAN CHAFE AGAINST HIS EARS I HAVE DECIDED THAT THE SITE FOR MY GRAVE SHALL BE AT THE END OF A TRUNK LINE SOMEWHERE AND I WILL ENDOW A DROSKA TO CARRY PASSENGERS TO AND FROM SAID GRAVE
6709-80475-0003 WHATEVER MY LIFE MAY HAVE BEEN AND HOWEVER SHORT I MAY HAVE FALLEN IN MY GREAT STRUGGLE FOR A GENEROUS RECOGNITION BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE I PROPOSE TO PLACE MY GRAVE WITHIN REACH OF ALL
6709-80475-0004 MONTICELLO IS REACHED BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO THE TOP OF A BEAUTIFUL HILL ON THE CREST OF WHICH RESTS THE BRICK HOUSE WHERE MISTER JEFFERSON LIVED YOU ENTER A LODGE GATE IN CHARGE OF A VENERABLE NEGRO TO WHOM YOU PAY TWO BITS APIECE FOR ADMISSION
6709-80475-0005 IT JUST GOES TOWARD IT HOWEVER IT DON'T QUITE GET THERE I JUDGE FOR THE ROADS ARE STILL APPEALING FOR AID PERHAPS THE NEGRO CAN TELL HOW FAR IT GETS UP THROUGH A NEGLECTED THICKET OF VIRGINIA SHRUBS AND
6709-80475-0006 ILL KEMPT TREES YOU DRIVE TO THE HOUSE IT IS A HOUSE THAT WOULD READILY COMMAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WITH QUEER PORCHES TO IT AND LARGE AIRY WINDOWS THE TOP OF THE WHOLE HILL WAS GRADED LEVEL OR TERRACED
6709-80475-0007 AND AN ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF WORK MUST HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO DO IT BUT JEFFERSON DID NOT CARE HE DID NOT CARE FOR FATIGUE WITH TWO HUNDRED SLAVES OF HIS OWN AND A DOWRY OF THREE HUNDRED MORE WHICH WAS POURED INTO HIS COFFERS BY HIS MARRIAGE
6709-80475-0008 JEFF DID NOT CARE HOW MUCH TOIL IT TOOK TO POLISH OFF THE TOP OF A BLUFF OR HOW MUCH THE SWEAT STOOD OUT ON THE BROW OF A HILL JEFFERSON WROTE THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE HE SENT IT TO ONE OF THE MAGAZINES BUT IT WAS RETURNED AS NOT AVAILABLE
6709-80475-0009 BOSOM BOARD ON THE RIGHT ARM UPON WHICH JEFFERSON USED TO REST HIS DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
6709-80475-0010 THERE IS ALSO AN OLD GIG STORED IN THE HOUSE
6709-80475-0011 THIS IS UNTRUE BUT IT GOES WITH THE PLACE IT TAKES FROM EIGHT THIRTY A M UNTIL NOON TO RIDE THIS DISTANCE ON A FAST TRAIN AND IN A MUCH MORE DIRECT LINE THAN THE OLD WAGON ROAD RAN
6709-80475-0012 IT IS NOW UNDER THE MANAGEMENT OF A CLASSICAL JANITOR WHO HAS A TINGE OF NEGRO BLOOD IN HIS VEINS MIXED WITH THE RICH CASTILIAN BLOOD OF SOMEBODY ELSE HE HAS BEEN AT THE HEAD OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA FOR OVER FORTY YEARS
6709-80475-0013 BRINGING IN THE COALS AND EXERCISING A GENERAL OVERSIGHT OVER THE CURRICULUM AND OTHER FURNITURE HE IS A MODEST MAN WITH A TENDENCY TOWARD THE CLASSICAL IN HIS RESEARCHES HE TOOK US UP ON THE ROOF SHOWED US THE OUTLYING COUNTRY AND JARRED OUR EAR DRUMS
6709-80475-0014 WITH THE BIG BELL MISTER ESTES WHO HAS GENERAL CHARGE OF MONTICELLO CALLED MONTECHELLO SAID THAT MISTER JEFFERSON USED TO SIT ON HIS FRONT PORCH WITH A POWERFUL GLASS
6709-80475-0015 AND IF THE WORKMEN UNDERTOOK TO SMUGGLE IN A SOFT BRICK MISTER JEFFERSON FIVE OR SIX MILES AWAY DETECTED IT AND BOUNDING LIGHTLY INTO HIS SADDLE HE RODE DOWN THERE TO CHARLOTTESVILLE AND CLUBBED THE BRICKLAYERS UNTIL THEY WERE GLAD TO PULL DOWN THE WALL
6709-80475-0016 TO THAT BRICK AND TAKE IT OUT AGAIN THIS STORY IS WHAT MADE ME SPEAK OF THAT SECTION A FEW MINUTES AGO AS AN OUTLYING COUNTRY THE OTHER DAY CHARLES L SEIGEL TOLD US THE CONFEDERATE VERSION OF AN ATTACK ON FORT MOULTRIE DURING THE
6709-80475-0017 WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN PRINTED MISTER SEIGEL WAS A GERMAN CONFEDERATE AND EARLY IN THE FIGHT WAS QUARTERED IN COMPANY WITH OTHERS AT THE MOULTRIE HOUSE A SEASIDE HOTEL THE GUESTS HAVING DESERTED THE BUILDING
6709-80475-0018 SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT FORGET THAT WAR WAS A SERIOUS MATTER NOBODY USED THEM BUT THEY WERE THERE ALL THE SAME
6709-80475-0019 SORROWFUL LITTLE LIGHT BLUE MAMMAL WITH A TINGE OF BITTER MELANCHOLY IN HIS VOICE HE USED TO DWELL ON THE PAST A GOOD DEAL AND AT NIGHT HE WOULD REFER TO IT IN TONES THAT WERE CHOKED WITH EMOTION
6709-80475-0020 THE BOYS CAUGHT HIM ONE EVENING AS THE GLOAMING BEGAN TO ARRANGE ITSELF AND THREW HIM DOWN ON THE GREEN GRASS THEY NEXT PULLED A STRAW BED OVER HIS HEAD AND INSERTED HIM IN IT COMPLETELY CUTTING HOLES FOR HIS LEGS
6709-80475-0021 THEN THEY TIED A STRING OF SLEIGH BELLS TO HIS TAIL AND HIT HIM A SMART STINGING BLOW WITH A BLACK SNAKE
6709-80475-0022 THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT THE RATTLE OF HOOFS THE CLASH OF THE BELLS THE QUICK CHALLENGE OF THE GUARD THE FAILURE TO GIVE THE COUNTERSIGN THE SHARP VOLLEY OF THE SENTINELS AND THE WILD CRY TO ARMS FOLLOWED IN RAPID SUCCESSION
6709-80475-0023 THE TOCSIN SOUNDED ALSO THE SLOGAN THE CULVERIN UKASE AND DOOR TENDER WERE ALL FIRED HUGE BEACONS OF FAT PINE WERE LIGHTED ALONG THE BEACH THE WHOLE SLUMBERING HOST SPRANG TO ARMS
6709-80475-0024 AND THE CRACK OF THE MUSKET WAS HEARD THROUGH THE INTENSE DARKNESS IN THE MORNING THE ENEMY WAS FOUND INTRENCHED IN A MUD HOLE SOUTH OF THE FORT WITH HIS CLEAN NEW STRAW TICK SPATTERED WITH CLAY AND A WILDLY DISHEVELED TAIL
6709-80475-0025 ON BOARD THE RICHMOND TRAIN NOT LONG AGO A MAN LOST HIS HAT AS WE PULLED OUT OF PETERSBURG AND IT FELL BY THE SIDE OF THE TRACK THE TRAIN WAS JUST MOVING SLOWLY AWAY FROM THE STATION SO HE HAD A CHANCE TO JUMP OFF AND RUN BACK AFTER IT
6709-80475-0026 HE GOT THE HAT BUT NOT TILL WE HAD PLACED SEVEN OR EIGHT MILES BETWEEN US AND HIM WE COULD NOT HELP FEELING SORRY FOR HIM BECAUSE VERY LIKELY HIS HAT HAD AN EMBROIDERED HAT BAND IN IT PRESENTED BY ONE DEARER TO HIM THAN LIFE ITSELF
6709-80475-0027 AND SO WE WORKED UP QUITE A FEELING FOR HIM THOUGH OF COURSE HE WAS VERY FOOLISH TO LOSE HIS TRAIN JUST FOR A HAT EVEN IF IT DID HAVE THE NEEDLE WORK OF HIS HEART'S IDOL IN IT LATER I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THE SAME MAN IN COLUMBIA SOUTH CAROLINA
6709-80475-0028 AND HE THEN TOLD ME THIS SAD STORY I STARTED OUT A MONTH AGO TO TAKE A LITTLE TRIP OF A FEW WEEKS AND THE FIRST DAY WAS VERY VERY HAPPILY SPENT IN SCRUTINIZING NATURE AND SCANNING THE FACES OF THOSE I SAW
6709-80475-0029 ON THE SECOND DAY OUT I RAN ACROSS A YOUNG MAN WHOM I HAD KNOWN SLIGHTLY BEFORE AND WHO IS ENGAGED IN THE BUSINESS OF BEING A COMPANIONABLE FELLOW AND THE LIFE OF THE PARTY THAT IS ABOUT ALL THE BUSINESS HE HAS HE KNOWS A GREAT MANY PEOPLE
6709-80475-0030 AND HIS CIRCLE OF ACQUAINTANCES IS GETTING LARGER ALL THE TIME HE IS PROUD OF THE ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF FRIENDSHIP HE HAS ACQUIRED HE SAYS HE CAN'T GET ON A TRAIN OR VISIT ANY TOWN IN THE UNION THAT HE DOESN'T FIND A FRIEND
6709-80475-0031 HE IS FULL OF STORIES AND WITTICISMS AND EXPLAINS THE PLAYS TO THEATER PARTIES HE HAS SEEN A GREAT DEAL OF LIFE AND IS A KEEN CRITIC
6709-80475-0032 IF HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE EPHESIANS HE WOULD HAVE CRITICIZED PAUL'S GESTURES AND SAID PAUL I LIKE YOUR EPISTLES A HEAP BETTER THAN I DO YOUR APPEARANCE ON THE PLATFORM YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF WELL ENOUGH WITH YOUR PEN
6709-80475-0033 WERE DISAPPOINTED IN YOU AND WE LOST MONEY ON YOU WELL HE JOINED ME AND FINDING OUT WHERE I WAS GOING HE DECIDED TO GO ALSO
6709-80475-0034 HE WENT ALONG TO EXPLAIN THINGS TO ME AND TALK TO ME WHEN I WANTED TO SLEEP OR READ THE NEWSPAPER HE INTRODUCED ME TO LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHOM I DID NOT WANT TO MEET TOOK ME TO SEE THINGS I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE
6709-80475-0035 HE MULTIPLIED MISERY BY THROWING UNCONGENIAL PEOPLE TOGETHER AND THEN SAID
6709-80475-0036 EVERYWHERE HE MET MORE NEW PEOPLE WITH WHOM HE HAD AN ACQUAINTANCE HE SHOOK HANDS WITH THEM AND CALLED THEM BY THEIR FIRST NAMES AND FELT IN THEIR POCKETS FOR CIGARS
6709-80475-0037 HE WAS JUST BUBBLING OVER WITH MIRTH AND LAUGHED ALL THE TIME BEING SO OFFENSIVELY JOYOUS IN FACT THAT WHEN HE WENT INTO A CAR HE ATTRACTED GENERAL ATTENTION WHICH SUITED HIM FIRST RATE
6709-80475-0038 THAT MADE HIM MORE OR LESS FEARED BY THE ADMINISTRATION HE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH A THOUSAND LITTLE VICES OF ALL OUR PUBLIC MEN WHICH VIRTUALLY PLACED THEM IN HIS POWER HE KNEW HOW THE PRESIDENT CONDUCTED HIMSELF AT HOME AND WAS ON TO EVERYTHING IN PUBLIC LIFE
6709-80475-0039 WELL HE SHOOK HANDS WITH THE PRESIDENT AND INTRODUCED ME I COULD SEE THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THOUGH AND SO I CAME AWAY WITHOUT REALLY FEELING THAT I KNEW HIM VERY WELL
6709-80475-0040 THEN WE VISITED THE DEPARTMENTS AND I CAN SEE NOW THAT I HURT MYSELF BY BEING TOWED AROUND BY THIS MAN HE WAS SO FREE AND SO JOYOUS AND SO BUBBLING THAT WHEREVER WE WENT I COULD HEAR THE KEY GRATE IN THE LOCK AFTER WE PASSED OUT OF THE DOOR
6709-80475-0041 HE STARTED SOUTH WITH ME HE WAS GOING TO SHOW ME ALL THE BATTLE FIELDS AND INTRODUCE ME INTO SOCIETY I BOUGHT SOME STRYCHNINE IN WASHINGTON AND PUT IT IN HIS BUCKWHEAT CAKES BUT THEY GOT COLD AND HE SENT THEM BACK I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO AND WAS ALMOST WILD
6709-80475-0042 FOR HIS PLEASURE EITHER AT PETERSBURG I WAS TOLD THAT THE TRAIN GOING THE OTHER WAY WOULD MEET US
