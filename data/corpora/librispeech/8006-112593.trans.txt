8006-112593-0000 HOW IRISH MISSIONARIES AND SCHOLARS SPREAD RELIGION AND LEARNING IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES TOWARDS THE END OF THE SIXTH CENTURY THE GREAT BODY OF THE IRISH WERE CHRISTIANS
8006-112593-0001 AND HUNDREDS OF DEVOTED AND DETERMINED MISSIONARIES LEFT OUR SHORES THERE WAS AMPLE FIELD FOR THEIR NOBLE AMBITION FOR THESE WERE THE DARK AGES WHEN THE CIVILISATION AND LEARNING
8006-112593-0002 BEQUEATHED BY OLD GREECE AND ROME HAD BEEN ALMOST WIPED OUT OF EXISTENCE BY THE BARBAROUS NORTHERN HORDES WHO OVERRAN EUROPE AND CHRISTIANITY HAD NOT YET TIME
8006-112593-0003 TO BEGIN WITH THE IRISH MISSIONARY WORK IN GREAT BRITAIN THE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN AND WESTERN SCOTLAND WHO WERE SOLIDLY PAGAN TILL THE SIXTH CENTURY
8006-112593-0004 WERE CONVERTED BY SAINT COLUMKILLE AND HIS MONKS FROM IONA WHO WERE ALL IRISHMEN FOR IONA WAS AN IRISH MONASTIC COLONY FOUNDED BY SAINT COLUMKILLE A NATIVE OF TIRCONNELL NOW DONEGAL
8006-112593-0005 IN THE SEVEN KINGDOMS OF ENGLAND THE HEPTARCHY THE ANGLO SAXONS WERE THE RULING RACE RUDE AND STUBBORN AND GREATLY ATTACHED TO THEIR GLOOMY NORTHERN PAGAN GODS
8006-112593-0006 AIDAN WAS AN IRISHMAN WHO ENTERED THE MONASTERY OF IONA FROM WHICH HE WAS SENT TO PREACH TO THE NORTHUMBRIANS ON THE INVITATION OF THEIR GOOD KING OSWALD HE FOUNDED THE MONASTERY OF LINDISFARNE
8006-112593-0007 WHICH AFTERWARDS BECAME SO ILLUSTRIOUS HE WAS ITS FIRST ABBOT AND FOR THIRTY YEARS IT WAS GOVERNED BY HIM AND BY TWO OTHER IRISH ABBOTS FINAN AND COLMAN IN SUCCESSION
8006-112593-0008 HE AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE WONDERFULLY SUCCESSFUL SO THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE LARGE KINGDOM OF NORTHUMBRIA BECAME CHRISTIANS
8006-112593-0009 OF THE ACTIVE LABOURS OF THE IRISH MISSIONARIES IN GREAT BRITAIN WHOLE CROWDS OF ARDENT AND LEARNED IRISHMEN TRAVELLED ON THE CONTINENT IN THE SIXTH SEVENTH AND SUCCEEDING CENTURIES
8006-112593-0010 SPREADING CHRISTIANITY AND SECULAR KNOWLEDGE EVERYWHERE AMONG THE PEOPLE ON THIS POINT WE HAVE THE DECISIVE TESTIMONY OF AN EMINENT FRENCH WRITER OF THE NINTH CENTURY
8006-112593-0011 WHO HIMSELF WITNESSED WHAT HE RECORDS IN A LETTER WRITTEN BY HIM TO CHARLES THE BALD KING OF FRANCE HE SAYS WHAT SHALL I SAY OF IRELAND WHO DESPISING THE DANGERS OF THE DEEP
8006-112593-0012 IS MIGRATING WITH ALMOST HER WHOLE TRAIN OF PHILOSOPHERS TO OUR COASTS AND OTHER FOREIGN EVIDENCES OF A LIKE KIND MIGHT BE BROUGHT FORWARD THESE MEN ON THEIR FIRST APPEARANCE ON THE CONTINENT
8006-112593-0013 CAUSED MUCH SURPRISE THEY WERE SO STARTLINGLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE PREACHERS THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO THEY TRAVELLED ON FOOT TOWARDS THEIR DESTINATION IN SMALL COMPANIES GENERALLY OF THIRTEEN
8006-112593-0014 AND UNDER THIS A WHITE TUNIC OF FINER STUFF THE LONG HAIR BEHIND FLOWED DOWN ON THE BACK AND THE EYELIDS WERE PAINTED OR STAINED BLACK EACH HAD A LONG STOUT WALKING STICK
8006-112593-0015 AND A WALLET CONTAINING HIS GREATEST TREASURE A BOOK OR TWO AND SOME RELICS THEY SPOKE A STRANGE LANGUAGE AMONG THEMSELVES USED LATIN TO THOSE WHO UNDERSTOOD IT AND MADE USE OF AN INTERPRETER WHEN PREACHING
8006-112593-0016 THEY KNEW WELL WHEN SETTING OUT THAT THEY WERE LEAVING COUNTRY AND FRIENDS PROBABLY FOR EVER FOR OF THOSE THAT WENT VERY FEW RETURNED ONCE ON THE CONTINENT THEY HAD TO MAKE THEIR WAY POOR AND FRIENDLESS
8006-112593-0017 THROUGH PEOPLE WHOSE LANGUAGE THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND AND WHO WERE IN MANY PLACES TEN TIMES MORE RUDE AND DANGEROUS IN THOSE AGES THAN THE INHABITANTS OF THESE ISLANDS AND WE KNOW AS A MATTER OF HISTORY THAT MANY WERE KILLED ON THE WAY
8006-112593-0018 FACED PRIVATION WITH INDIFFERENCE CARING NOTHING FOR LUXURIES AND WHEN OTHER PROVISIONS FAILED THEM THEY GATHERED WILD FRUIT TRAPPED ANIMALS AND FISHED WITH GREAT DEXTERITY AND WITH ANY SORT OF NEXT TO HAND RUDE APPLIANCES
8006-112593-0019 THEY WERE SOMEWHAT ROUGH IN OUTWARD APPEARANCE BUT BENEATH ALL THAT THEY HAD SOLID SENSE AND MUCH LEARNING THEIR SIMPLE WAYS THEIR UNMISTAKABLE PIETY
8006-112593-0020 CAUGHT THE PEOPLE EVERYWHERE SO THAT THEY MADE CONVERTS IN CROWDS A GREAT FRENCH WRITER MONTALEMBERT SPEAKS OF THE IRISH OF THOSE DAYS AS HAVING A PASSION FOR PILGRIMAGE AND PREACHING
8006-112593-0021 AND AS FEELING
8006-112593-0022 MANY WERE TO BE FOUND IN EGYPT AND AS EARLY AS THE SEVENTH CENTURY THREE LEARNED IRISH MONKS FOUND THEIR WAY TO CARTHAGE WHERE THEY LABOURED FOR A LONG TIME AND WITH GREAT SUCCESS WHEREVER THEY WENT
8006-112593-0023 THEY MADE PILGRIMAGES TO HOLY PLACES PLACES SANCTIFIED BY MEMORIES OF EARLY SAINTS AND WHENEVER THEY FOUND IT PRACTICABLE THEY WERE SURE TO MAKE THEIR WAY TO ROME
8006-112593-0024 TO VISIT THE SHRINES OF THE APOSTLES AND OBTAIN THE BLESSING OF THE POPE THE IRISH PASSION FOR PILGRIMAGE AND PREACHING NEVER DIED OUT IT IS A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE RACE
8006-112593-0025 THIS GREAT MISSIONARY EMIGRATION TO FOREIGN LANDS HAS CONTINUED IN A MEASURE DOWN TO OUR OWN DAY FOR IT MAY BE SAFELY ASSERTED THAT NO OTHER MISSIONARIES ARE PLAYING SO GENERAL AND SUCCESSFUL A PART
8006-112593-0026 IN THE CONVERSION OF THE PAGAN PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD AND IN KEEPING ALIGHT THE LAMP OF RELIGION AMONG CHRISTIANS AS THOSE OF IRELAND IRISHMEN WERE EQUALLY ACTIVE IN SPREADING SECULAR KNOWLEDGE
8006-112593-0027 INDEED THE TWO FUNCTIONS WERE GENERALLY COMBINED FOR IT WAS QUITE COMMON TO FIND A MAN A SUCCESSFUL MISSIONARY WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ACTING AS PROFESSOR IN A COLLEGE OR AS HEAD OF SOME GREAT SEMINARY FOR GENERAL EDUCATION
8006-112593-0028 IRISH PROFESSORS AND TEACHERS WERE IN THOSE TIMES HELD IN SUCH ESTIMATION THAT THEY WERE EMPLOYED IN MOST OF THE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES OF GREAT BRITAIN FRANCE GERMANY AND ITALY
8006-112593-0029 THE REVIVAL OF LEARNING ON THE CONTINENT WAS INDEED DUE IN NO SMALL DEGREE TO THOSE IRISH MISSIONARIES IT WAS ENOUGH THAT THE CANDIDATE FOR AN APPOINTMENT CAME FROM IRELAND HE NEEDED NO OTHER RECOMMENDATION
8006-112593-0030 WHEN LEARNING HAD DECLINED IN ENGLAND IN THE NINTH AND TENTH CENTURIES OWING TO THE DEVASTATIONS OF THE DANES IT WAS CHIEFLY BY IRISH TEACHERS IT WAS KEPT ALIVE AND RESTORED IN GLASTONBURY ESPECIALLY
8006-112593-0031 THEY TAUGHT WITH GREAT SUCCESS WE ARE TOLD BY ENGLISH WRITERS THAT THEY WERE SKILLED IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF LEARNING SACRED AND PROFANE AND THAT UNDER THEM WERE EDUCATED MANY YOUNG ENGLISH NOBLES
8006-112593-0032 SENT TO GLASTONBURY WITH THAT OBJECT AMONG THESE STUDENTS THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WAS SAINT DUNSTAN WHO ACCORDING TO ALL HIS BIOGRAPHERS RECEIVED HIS EDUCATION BOTH SCRIPTURAL AND SECULAR
8006-112593-0033 FROM IRISH MASTERS THERE AS FOR THE NUMEROUS CONTINENTAL SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES IN WHICH IRISHMEN FIGURED EITHER AS PRINCIPALS OR PROFESSORS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH OUR LIMITED SPACE
8006-112593-0034 TO NOTICE THEM HERE A FEW HAVE BEEN GLANCED AT IN THE LAST CHAPTER AND I WILL FINISH THIS SHORT NARRATIVE BY RELATING THE ODD MANNER IN WHICH TWO DISTINGUISHED IRISHMEN BROTHERS
8006-112593-0035 ONE OF THE HISTORIANS OF THE REIGN OF CHARLEMAGNE WHO WROTE IN THE NINTH CENTURY HAS LEFT US THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT OF THESE TWO SCHOLARS WHEN THE ILLUSTRIOUS CHARLES BEGAN TO REIGN ALONE IN THE WESTERN PARTS OF THE WORLD
8006-112593-0036 AND LITERATURE WAS ALMOST FORGOTTEN IT HAPPENED THAT TWO SCOTS FROM IRELAND
8006-112593-0037 MEN INCOMPARABLY SKILLED IN HUMAN LEARNING AND IN THE HOLY SCRIPTURES OBSERVING HOW THE MERCHANTS EXHIBITED AND DREW ATTENTION TO THEIR WARES THEY ACTED IN A SIMILAR FASHION
8006-112593-0038 LET THEM COME TO US FOR WE HAVE IT TO SELL THIS THEY REPEATED AS THEY WENT FROM PLACE TO PLACE SO THAT THE PEOPLE WONDERED VERY MUCH AND SOME THOUGHT THEM TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN PERSONS HALF CRAZED
8006-112593-0039 STRANGE RUMOURS REGARDING THEM WENT ROUND AND AT LENGTH CAME TO THE EARS OF KING CHARLES ON WHICH HE SENT FOR THE BROTHERS AND HAD THEM BROUGHT TO HIS PRESENCE HE QUESTIONED THEM CLOSELY USING THE LATIN LANGUAGE
8006-112593-0040 WE REQUIRE PROPER HOUSES AND ACCOMMODATION PUPILS WITH INGENIOUS MINDS AND REALLY ANXIOUS TO LEARN AND AS WE ARE IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY WHERE WE CANNOT CONVENIENTLY WORK FOR OUR BREAD
8006-112593-0041 NOW AT THIS VERY TIME KING CHARLES WAS USING HIS BEST EFFORTS TO RESTORE LEARNING BY OPENING SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT HIS DOMINIONS BUT FOUND IT HARD TO PROCURE A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF QUALIFIED TEACHERS
8006-112593-0042 AND AS HE PERCEIVED THAT THESE BROTHERS WERE EVIDENTLY MEN OF REAL LEARNING AND OF A SUPERIOR CAST IN EVERY WAY HE JOYFULLY ACCEPTED THEIR PROPOSALS
8006-112593-0043 HAVING KEPT THEM FOR SOME TIME ON A VISIT IN HIS PALACE HE FINALLY OPENED A GREAT SCHOOL IN SOME PART OF FRANCE PROBABLY PARIS FOR THE EDUCATION OF BOYS OF ALL RANKS OF SOCIETY
8006-112593-0044 NOT ONLY FOR THE SONS OF THE HIGHEST NOBLES BUT ALSO FOR THOSE OF THE MIDDLE AND LOW CLASSES AT THE HEAD OF WHICH HE PLACED CLEMENT
8006-112593-0045 HE ALSO DIRECTED THAT ALL THE SCHOLARS SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH FOOD AND SUITABLE HABITATIONS IT WAS IN FACT A GREAT FREE BOARDING SCHOOL FOUNDED AND MAINTAINED AT THE EXPENSE OF THE KING
