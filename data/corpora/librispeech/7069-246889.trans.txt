7069-246889-0000 THAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN REMOVED A WEEK AGO OUT UPON THE OLD FASHIONED GARDEN AND MEADOWS BEYOND WHERE EACH LONELY TREE BOWED WITH DRIFTING GARMENTS
7069-246889-0001 AWAY FROM ITS STORMING ENEMY SHE DID NOT FEEL INCLINED TO GO OUT
7069-246889-0002 SHE ALWAYS FELT HAPPIER IN A NEW DRESS WHEN IT WAS MADE TO HER MIND AND FITTED HER BODY AND WHEN THE SUN SHONE SHE WAS LIGHTER HEARTED THAN WHEN IT RAINED I HAD WRITTEN MERRIER BUT HELEN WAS SELDOM MERRY
7069-246889-0003 AND HAD SHE BEEN MADE AWARE OF THE FACT AND QUESTIONED WHY WOULD HAVE ANSWERED BECAUSE SHE SO SELDOM SAW REASON SHE WAS WHAT ALL HER FRIENDS CALLED A SENSIBLE GIRL
7069-246889-0004 RATHER THAN THE CONVICTION THAT THE FIRESIDE IN HER OWN ROOM WAS RENDERED EVEN MORE ATTRACTIVE BY THE UNFRIENDLY ASPECT OF THINGS OUTSIDE AND THE ROAR IN THE CHIMNEY WHICH HAPPILY WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY A CHANGE IN THE CURRENT OF THE SMOKE
7069-246889-0005 THE HOURS BETWEEN LUNCHEON AND TEA ARE CONFESSEDLY DULL BUT DULNESS IS NOT INIMICAL TO A CERTAIN KIND OF COMFORT AND HELEN LIKED TO BE THAT WAY COMFORTABLE
7069-246889-0006 NOR HAD SHE EVER YET BEEN AWARE OF SELF REBUKE BECAUSE OF THE LIKING LET US SEE WHAT KIND AND DEGREE OF COMFORT SHE HAD IN THE COURSE OF AN HOUR AND A HALF ATTAINED
7069-246889-0007 AND IN DISCOVERING THIS I SHALL BE ABLE TO PRESENT HER TO MY READER WITH A LITTLE MORE CIRCUMSTANCE SHE SAT BEFORE THE FIRE IN A RATHER MASCULINE POSTURE
7069-246889-0008 PARALLEL WITH THE LINES OF THE CHAIR HER ARMS LYING ON ITS ARMS AND THE FINGERS OF EACH HAND FOLDED DOWN OVER THE END OF EACH ARM SQUARE STRAIGHT RIGHT ANGLED GAZING INTO THE FIRE WITH SOMETHING OF
7069-246889-0009 THE LOOK OF A SAGE BUT ONE WHO HAS MADE NO DISCOVERY SHE HAD JUST FINISHED THE NOVEL OF THE DAY AND WAS SUFFERING A MILD REACTION THE MILDER PERHAPS
7069-246889-0010 THAT SHE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SATISFIED WITH THE CONSUMMATION FOR THE HEROINE HAD AFTER MUCH SORROW AND PATIENT ENDURANCE AT LENGTH MARRIED A MAN WHOM SHE COULD NOT HELP KNOWING
7069-246889-0011 INDEED HER DISSATISFACTION WENT SO FAR THAT ALTHOUGH THE FIRE KEPT BURNING AWAY IN PERFECT CONTENT BEFORE HER ENHANCED BY THE BELLOWING COMPLAINT OF THE WIND IN THE CHIMNEY SHE YET CAME NEARER THINKING
7069-246889-0012 THAN SHE HAD EVER BEEN IN HER LIFE NOW THINKING ESPECIALLY TO ONE WHO TRIES IT FOR THE FIRST TIME IS SELDOM OR NEVER A QUITE COMFORTABLE OPERATION AND HENCE
7069-246889-0013 AFRICAN EXPLORERS PYRAMID INSPECTORS AND SUCH LIKE BUT FOR EVERY MAN AND WOMAN BORN INTO THE BLINDNESS OF THE PLANET IS TO DISCOVER AFTER WHICH DISCOVERY THERE IS
7069-246889-0014 FAR FROM IT WHEN I SAY THAT SHE CAME NEAR THINKING I SAY MORE FOR HER THAN ANY BUT THE FEW WHO KNOW WHAT THINKING IS WILL UNDERSTAND
7069-246889-0015 FOR THAT WHICH CHIEFLY DISTINGUISHES MAN FROM THOSE HE CALLS THE LOWER ANIMALS IS THE FACULTY HE MOST RARELY EXERCISES TRUE HELEN SUPPOSED SHE COULD THINK LIKE OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE
7069-246889-0016 THE THOUGHTS OF OTHER PEOPLE HAD PASSED THROUGH HER IN TOLERABLE PLENTY LEAVING MANY A PHANTOM CONCLUSION BEHIND BUT THIS WAS THEIR THINKING NOT HERS SHE HAD THOUGHT NO MORE THAN WAS NECESSARY NOW AND THEN
7069-246889-0017 BUT SCANTY ONES INDEED WITH THE UNIVERSE
7069-246889-0018 EVERY ONE OF WHICH NATURE FITS FOR A QUEEN BUT ITS NURSES PREVENT FROM GROWING ONE BY PROVIDING FOR IT A CELL TOO NARROW FOR THE UNROLLING OF ROYALTY
7069-246889-0019 AND SUPPLYING IT WITH FOOD NOT POTENT ENOUGH FOR THE NURTURE OF THE IDEAL WITH THIS DIFFERENCE HOWEVER THAT THE CRAMPED AND STINTED THING COMES OUT IF NO QUEEN THEN A WORKING BEE
7069-246889-0020 PARTLY THROUGH HIS MARRIAGE WITH A HINDOO LADY BY WHOM HE HAD ONE CHILD A BOY SOME THREE YEARS YOUNGER THAN HELEN WHEN HE DIED HE LEFT HIS FORTUNE EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE TWO CHILDREN
7069-246889-0021 HELEN WAS NOW THREE AND TWENTY AND HER OWN MISTRESS HER APPEARANCE SUGGESTED NORWEGIAN BLOOD FOR SHE WAS TALL BLUE EYED AND DARK HAIRED BUT FAIR SKINNED WITH REGULAR FEATURES AND AN OVER
7069-246889-0022 STILL SOME WHO DID NOT LIKE HER SAID HARD EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE NO ONE HAD EVER CALLED HER NELLY YET SHE HAD LONG REMAINED A GIRL
7069-246889-0023 MUST AT LENGTH GET WEARY OF HIS PALTRY SELF BUT HELEN FROM THE SLOW RATE OF HER EXPANSION WAS NOT OLD ENOUGH YET NOR WAS SHE IN ANY SPECIAL SENSE
7069-246889-0024 WRAPT UP IN HERSELF IT WAS ONLY THAT SHE HAD NEVER YET BROKEN THE SHELL WHICH CONTINUES TO SHUT IN SO MANY HUMAN CHICKENS LONG AFTER THEY IMAGINE THEMSELVES CITIZENS OF THE REAL WORLD
7069-246889-0025 BEING SOMEWHAT BORED THEN AND DIMLY AWARE THAT TO BE BORED WAS OUT OF HARMONY WITH SOMETHING OR OTHER HELEN WAS ON THE VERGE OF THINKING
7069-246889-0026 BUT AS I HAVE SAID ESCAPED THE SNARE IN A VERY DIRECT AND SIMPLE FASHION SHE WENT FAST ASLEEP AND NEVER WOKE TILL HER MAID BROUGHT HER THE CUP OF KITCHEN TEA FROM WHICH THE INMATES OF SOME HOUSES DERIVE THE STRENGTH
