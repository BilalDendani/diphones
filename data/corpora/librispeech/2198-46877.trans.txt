2198-46877-0031 THE GOLDEN FUTURE OF HOPE AND PROMISE STRETCHING OUT BEFORE THEIR YOUTHFUL EYES ALAS FOR THOSE GREEN SPRING DREAMING HOW OFTEN DO THEY FADE AND WITHER UNTIL THEY FALL AND ROT A DREARY SIGHT BY THE WAYSIDE OF LIFE
2198-46877-0032 BUT HERE BY GOD'S BLESSING IT WAS NOT SO FOR THEY BURGEONED AND THEY GREW EVER FAIRER AND MORE NOBLE UNTIL THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD MIGHT MARVEL AT THE BEAUTY OF IT IT HAS BEEN TOLD ELSEWHERE HOW AS THE YEARS PASSED
2198-46877-0033 NIGEL'S NAME ROSE HIGHER IN HONOR BUT STILL MARY'S WOULD KEEP PACE WITH IT EACH HELPING AND SUSTAINING THE OTHER UPON AN EVER HIGHER PATH IN MANY LANDS DID NIGEL CARVE HIS FAME AND EVER AS HE RETURNED SPENT AND WEARY FROM HIS WORK
2198-46877-0034 HE DRANK FRESH STRENGTH AND FIRE AND CRAVING FOR HONOR FROM HER WHO GLORIFIED HIS HOME AT TWYNHAM CASTLE THEY DWELLED FOR MANY YEARS BELOVED AND HONORED BY ALL THEN IN THE FULLNESS OF TIME THEY CAME BACK TO THE TILFORD MANOR HOUSE
2198-46877-0035 AND SPENT THEIR HAPPY HEALTHY AGE AMID THOSE HEATHER DOWNS WHERE NIGEL HAD PASSED HIS FIRST LUSTY YOUTH ERE EVER HE TURNED HIS FACE TO THE WARS THITHER ALSO CAME AYLWARD WHEN HE HAD LEFT THE PIED MERLIN WHERE FOR MANY A YEAR HE SOLD ALE TO THE MEN OF THE FOREST
2198-46877-0036 BUT THE YEARS PASS THE OLD WHEEL TURNS AND EVER THE THREAD RUNS OUT THE WISE AND THE GOOD THE NOBLE AND THE BRAVE
2198-46877-0037 WHENCE WHITHER AND WHY WHO MAY SAY HERE IS THE SLOPE OF HINDHEAD THE FERN STILL GLOWS RUSSET IN NOVEMBER THE HEATHER STILL BURNS RED IN JULY BUT WHERE NOW IS THE MANOR OF COSFORD WHERE IS THE OLD HOUSE OF TILFORD
2198-46877-0038 WHERE BUT FOR A FEW SCATTERED GRAY STONES IS THE MIGHTY PILE OF WAVERLEY AND YET EVEN GNAWING TIME HAS NOT EATEN ALL THINGS AWAY WALK WITH ME TOWARD GUILDFORD READER UPON THE BUSY HIGHWAY
2198-46877-0039 HERE WHERE THE HIGH GREEN MOUND RISES BEFORE US MARK YONDER ROOFLESS SHRINE WHICH STILL STANDS FOURSQUARE TO THE WINDS
2198-46877-0040 WHERE NIGEL AND MARY PLIGHTED THEIR FAITH BELOW LIES THE WINDING RIVER AND OVER YONDER YOU STILL SEE THE DARK CHANTRY WOODS WHICH MOUNT UP TO THE BARE SUMMIT ON WHICH ROOFED AND WHOLE STANDS THAT CHAPEL OF THE MARTYR
2198-46877-0041 WHERE THE COMRADES BEAT OFF THE ARCHERS OF THE CROOKED LORD OF SHALFORD DOWN YONDER ON THE FLANKS OF THE LONG CHALK HILLS ONE TRACES THE ROAD BY WHICH THEY MADE THEIR JOURNEY TO THE WARS AND NOW TURN HITHER TO THE NORTH
2198-46877-0042 DOWN THIS SUNKEN WINDING PATH IT IS ALL UNCHANGED SINCE NIGEL'S DAY HERE IS THE CHURCH OF COMPTON PASS UNDER THE AGED AND CRUMBLING ARCH BEFORE THE STEPS OF THAT ANCIENT ALTAR UNRECORDED AND UNBRASSED
2198-46877-0043 LIES THE DUST OF NIGEL AND OF MARY NEAR THEM IS THAT OF MAUDE THEIR DAUGHTER AND OF ALLEYNE EDRICSON WHOSE SPOUSE SHE WAS THEIR CHILDREN AND CHILDREN'S CHILDREN ARE LYING BY THEIR SIDE
2198-46877-0044 HERE TOO NEAR THE OLD YEW IN THE CHURCHYARD
2198-46877-0045 SO LIE THE DEAD LEAVES BUT THEY AND SUCH AS THEY NOURISH FOREVER THAT GREAT OLD TRUNK OF ENGLAND WHICH STILL SHEDS FORTH ANOTHER CROP AND ANOTHER EACH AS STRONG AND AS FAIR AS THE LAST
2198-46877-0046 THE BODY MAY LIE IN MOLDERING CHANCEL OR IN CRUMBLING VAULT BUT THE RUMOR OF NOBLE LIVES THE RECORD OF VALOR AND TRUTH CAN NEVER DIE BUT LIVES ON IN THE SOUL OF THE PEOPLE OUR OWN WORK LIES READY TO OUR HANDS
2198-46877-0047 AND YET OUR STRENGTH MAY BE THE GREATER AND OUR FAITH THE FIRMER IF WE SPARE AN HOUR FROM PRESENT TOILS TO LOOK BACK UPON THE WOMEN WHO WERE GENTLE AND STRONG OR THE MEN WHO LOVED HONOR MORE THAN LIFE ON THIS GREEN STAGE OF ENGLAND
