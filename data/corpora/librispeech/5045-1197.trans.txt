5045-1197-0000 AND THERE WAS A GOOD FLOOR ON WHICH WAS ARRANGED SOME FURNITURE THAT WAS QUITE COMFORTABLE IT IS CERTAIN THAT JACK PUMPKINHEAD MIGHT HAVE HAD A MUCH FINER HOUSE TO LIVE IN HAD HE WANTED IT FOR OZMA LOVED THE STUPID FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HER EARLIEST COMPANION
5045-1197-0001 BUT JACK PREFERRED HIS PUMPKIN HOUSE AS IT MATCHED HIMSELF VERY WELL AND IN THIS HE WAS NOT SO STUPID AFTER ALL THE BODY OF THIS REMARKABLE PERSON WAS MADE OF WOOD
5045-1197-0002 THE NECK WAS A SHARPENED STICK ON WHICH THE PUMPKIN HEAD WAS SET AND THE EYES EARS NOSE AND MOUTH WERE CARVED ON THE SKIN OF THE PUMPKIN VERY LIKE A CHILD'S JACK O' LANTERN
5045-1197-0003 SOME OF THE PUMPKINS NOW RIPENING ON THE VINES WERE ALMOST AS LARGE AS JACK'S HOUSE AND HE TOLD DOROTHY HE INTENDED TO ADD ANOTHER PUMPKIN TO HIS MANSION
5045-1197-0004 AND INVITED TO PASS THE NIGHT THERE WHICH THEY HAD PLANNED TO DO THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS GREATLY INTERESTED IN JACK AND EXAMINED HIM ADMIRINGLY YOU ARE QUITE HANDSOME SHE SAID BUT NOT AS REALLY BEAUTIFUL AS THE SCARECROW
5045-1197-0005 JACK TURNED AT THIS TO EXAMINE THE SCARECROW CRITICALLY AND HIS OLD FRIEND SLYLY WINKED ONE PAINTED EYE AT HIM THERE IS NO ACCOUNTING FOR TASTES REMARKED THE PUMPKINHEAD WITH A SIGH
5045-1197-0006 AN OLD CROW ONCE TOLD ME I WAS VERY FASCINATING BUT OF COURSE THE BIRD MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN YET I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE CROWS USUALLY AVOID THE SCARECROW
5045-1197-0007 BUT STUFFED I AM NOT STUFFED YOU WILL OBSERVE MY BODY IS GOOD SOLID HICKORY I ADORE STUFFING SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL WELL AS FOR THAT MY HEAD IS STUFFED WITH PUMPKIN SEEDS DECLARED JACK
5045-1197-0008 I USE THEM FOR BRAINS AND WHEN THEY ARE FRESH I AM INTELLECTUAL JUST NOW I REGRET TO SAY MY SEEDS ARE RATTLING A BIT SO I MUST SOON GET ANOTHER HEAD OH DO YOU CHANGE YOUR HEAD ASKED OJO TO BE SURE
5045-1197-0009 PUMPKINS ARE NOT PERMANENT MORE'S THE PITY AND IN TIME THEY SPOIL THAT IS WHY I GROW SUCH A GREAT FIELD OF PUMPKINS THAT I MAY SELECT A NEW HEAD WHENEVER NECESSARY WHO CARVES THE FACES ON THEM INQUIRED THE BOY
5045-1197-0010 I DO THAT MYSELF I LIFT OFF MY OLD HEAD
5045-1197-0011 AND USE THE FACE FOR A PATTERN TO GO BY SOMETIMES THE FACES I CARVE ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS MORE EXPRESSIVE AND CHEERFUL YOU KNOW BUT I THINK THEY AVERAGE VERY WELL BEFORE SHE HAD STARTED ON THE JOURNEY
5045-1197-0012 DOROTHY HAD PACKED A KNAPSACK WITH THE THINGS SHE MIGHT NEED AND THIS KNAPSACK THE SCARECROW CARRIED STRAPPED TO HIS BACK THE LITTLE GIRL WORE A PLAIN GINGHAM DRESS AND A CHECKED SUNBONNET AS SHE KNEW THEY WERE BEST FITTED FOR TRAVEL
5045-1197-0013 OJO ALSO HAD BROUGHT ALONG HIS BASKET TO WHICH OZMA HAD ADDED A BOTTLE OF SQUARE MEAL TABLETS AND SOME FRUIT BUT JACK PUMPKINHEAD GREW A LOT OF THINGS IN HIS GARDEN BESIDES PUMPKINS
5045-1197-0014 SO HE COOKED FOR THEM A FINE VEGETABLE SOUP AND GAVE DOROTHY OJO AND TOTO THE ONLY ONES WHO FOUND IT NECESSARY TO EAT A PUMPKIN PIE AND SOME GREEN CHEESE
5045-1197-0015 FOR BEDS THEY MUST USE THE SWEET DRIED GRASSES WHICH JACK HAD STREWN ALONG ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM BUT THAT SATISFIED DOROTHY AND OJO VERY WELL TOTO OF COURSE SLEPT BESIDE HIS LITTLE MISTRESS
5045-1197-0016 THE SCARECROW SCRAPS AND THE PUMPKINHEAD WERE TIRELESS AND HAD NO NEED TO SLEEP SO THEY SAT UP AND TALKED TOGETHER ALL NIGHT BUT THEY STAYED OUTSIDE THE HOUSE UNDER THE BRIGHT STARS AND TALKED IN LOW TONES SO AS NOT TO DISTURB THE SLEEPERS
5045-1197-0017 DURING THE CONVERSATION THE SCARECROW EXPLAINED THEIR QUEST FOR A DARK WELL AND ASKED JACK'S ADVICE WHERE TO FIND IT THE PUMPKINHEAD CONSIDERED THE MATTER GRAVELY THAT IS GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT TASK
5045-1197-0018 I'D TAKE ANY ORDINARY WELL AND ENCLOSE IT SO AS TO MAKE IT DARK I FEAR THAT WOULDN'T DO REPLIED THE SCARECROW
5045-1197-0019 ANSWERED THE SCARECROW WHO DID NOT WISH TO DISPLAY HIS IGNORANCE I KNOW CRIED SCRAPS JACK AND JILL WENT UP THE HILL TO FETCH NO NO THAT'S WRONG INTERRUPTED THE SCARECROW THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF GILLS I THINK
5045-1197-0020 ONE IS A GIRL AND THE OTHER IS A GILLYFLOWER SAID JACK NO A MEASURE HOW BIG A MEASURE WELL I'LL ASK DOROTHY SO NEXT MORNING THEY ASKED DOROTHY
5045-1197-0021 AND SHE SAID I DON'T JUST KNOW HOW MUCH A GILL IS BUT I'VE BROUGHT ALONG A GOLD FLASK THAT HOLDS A PINT THAT'S MORE THAN A GILL I'M SURE AND THE CROOKED MAGICIAN MAY MEASURE IT TO SUIT HIMSELF
5045-1197-0022 SO HAVE I SAID DOROTHY
5045-1197-0023 THE QUADLING COUNTRY IS FULL OF DANGERS DECLARED JACK I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE MYSELF BUT I HAVE SAID THE SCARECROW I'VE FACED THE DREADFUL HAMMERHEADS WHICH HAVE NO ARMS AND BUTT YOU LIKE A GOAT
5045-1197-0024 AND I'VE FACED THE FIGHTING TREES WHICH BEND DOWN THEIR BRANCHES TO POUND AND WHIP YOU AND HAD MANY OTHER ADVENTURES THERE IT'S A WILD COUNTRY REMARKED DOROTHY SOBERLY AND IF WE GO THERE WE'RE SURE TO HAVE TROUBLES OF OUR OWN
5045-1197-0025 BUT I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO GO IF WE WANT THAT GILL OF WATER FROM THE DARK WELL SO THEY SAID GOOD BYE TO THE PUMPKINHEAD AND RESUMED THEIR TRAVELS
5045-1197-0026 HEADING NOW DIRECTLY TOWARD THE SOUTH COUNTRY WHERE MOUNTAINS AND ROCKS AND CAVERNS AND FORESTS OF GREAT TREES ABOUNDED THIS PART OF THE LAND OF OZ WHILE IT BELONGED TO OZMA AND OWED HER ALLEGIANCE WAS SO WILD AND SECLUDED
5045-1197-0027 THAT MANY QUEER PEOPLES HID IN ITS JUNGLES AND LIVED IN THEIR OWN WAY WITHOUT EVEN A KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAD A RULER IN THE EMERALD CITY IF THEY WERE LEFT ALONE THESE CREATURES NEVER TROUBLED THE INHABITANTS OF THE REST OF OZ
5045-1197-0028 BUT THOSE WHO INVADED THEIR DOMAINS ENCOUNTERED MANY DANGERS FROM THEM IT WAS A TWO DAYS JOURNEY FROM JACK PUMKINHEAD'S HOUSE TO THE EDGE OF THE QUADLING COUNTRY FOR NEITHER DOROTHY NOR OJO COULD WALK VERY FAST
5045-1197-0029 TOWARD EVENING OF THE SECOND DAY THEY REACHED A SANDY PLAIN WHERE WALKING WAS DIFFICULT BUT SOME DISTANCE BEFORE THEM THEY SAW A GROUP OF PALM TREES WITH MANY CURIOUS BLACK DOTS UNDER THEM SO THEY TRUDGED BRAVELY ON
5045-1197-0030 TWILIGHT HAD FALLEN BY THE TIME THEY CAME TO THE TREES BENEATH WHICH WERE THE BLACK CIRCULAR OBJECTS THEY HAD MARKED FROM A DISTANCE DOZENS OF THEM WERE SCATTERED AROUND AND DOROTHY BENT NEAR TO ONE
5045-1197-0031 ANOTHER AND ANOTHER POPPED OUT OF THE CIRCULAR POT LIKE DWELLING WHILE FROM ALL THE OTHER BLACK OBJECTS CAME POPPING MORE CREATURES VERY LIKE JUMPING JACKS WHEN THEIR BOXES ARE UNHOOKED
5045-1197-0032 UNTIL FULLY A HUNDRED STOOD GATHERED AROUND OUR LITTLE GROUP OF TRAVELERS BY THIS TIME DOROTHY HAD DISCOVERED THEY WERE PEOPLE TINY AND CURIOUSLY FORMED BUT STILL PEOPLE THEIR SKINS WERE DUSKY AND THEIR HAIR STOOD STRAIGHT UP
5045-1197-0033 LIKE WIRES AND WAS BRILLIANT SCARLET IN COLOR THEIR BODIES WERE BARE EXCEPT FOR SKINS FASTENED AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND THEY WORE BRACELETS ON THEIR ANKLES AND WRISTS AND NECKLACES AND GREAT PENDANT EARRINGS
5045-1197-0034 TOTO CROUCHED BESIDE HIS MISTRESS AND WAILED AS IF HE DID NOT LIKE THESE STRANGE CREATURES A BIT SCRAPS BEGAN TO MUTTER SOMETHING ABOUT HOPPITY POPPITY JUMPITY DUMP BUT NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO HER
5045-1197-0035 THE WORDS BEING AS FOLLOWS WE'RE THE JOLLY TOTTENHOTS WE DO NOT LIKE THE DAY BUT IN THE NIGHT TIS OUR DELIGHT TO GAMBOL SKIP AND PLAY WE HATE THE SUN AND FROM IT RUN THE MOON IS COOL AND CLEAR SO ON THIS SPOT EACH TOTTENHOT
5045-1197-0036 WAITS FOR IT TO APPEAR WE'RE EV'RY ONE CHOCK FULL OF FUN AND FULL OF MISCHIEF TOO BUT IF YOU'RE GAY AND WITH US PLAY WE'LL DO NO HARM TO YOU GLAD TO MEET YOU TOTTENHOTS SAID THE SCARECROW SOLEMNLY
5045-1197-0037 ASTONISHED TO FIND THE STRAW MAN WHIRL AROUND SO EASILY SO THE TOTTENHOT RAISED THE SCARECROW HIGH IN THE AIR AND TOSSED HIM OVER THE HEADS OF THE CROWD SOME ONE CAUGHT HIM AND TOSSED HIM BACK AND SO WITH SHOUTS OF GLEE THEY CONTINUED THROWING THE SCARECROW HERE AND THERE
5045-1197-0038 AS IF HE HAD BEEN A BASKET BALL PRESENTLY ANOTHER IMP SEIZED SCRAPS AND BEGAN TO THROW HER ABOUT IN THE SAME WAY THEY FOUND HER A LITTLE HEAVIER THAN THE SCARECROW BUT STILL LIGHT ENOUGH TO BE TOSSED LIKE A SOFA CUSHION
5045-1197-0039 AND THEY WERE ENJOYING THE SPORT IMMENSELY WHEN DOROTHY ANGRY AND INDIGNANT AT THE TREATMENT HER FRIENDS WERE RECEIVING RUSHED AMONG THE TOTTENHOTS AND BEGAN SLAPPING AND PUSHING THEM UNTIL SHE HAD RESCUED THE SCARECROW AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL
5045-1197-0040 AND HELD THEM CLOSE ON EITHER SIDE OF HER PERHAPS SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THIS VICTORY SO EASILY HAD NOT TOTO HELPED HER BARKING AND SNAPPING AT THE BARE LEGS OF THE IMPS UNTIL THEY WERE GLAD TO FLEE FROM HIS ATTACK AS FOR OJO
5045-1197-0041 SOME OF THE CREATURES HAD ATTEMPTED TO TOSS HIM ALSO BUT FINDING HIS BODY TOO HEAVY THEY THREW HIM TO THE GROUND AND A ROW OF THE IMPS SAT ON HIM AND HELD HIM FROM ASSISTING DOROTHY IN HER BATTLE
5045-1197-0042 AND ONE OR TWO WHO HAD BEEN SLAPPED HARDEST BEGAN TO CRY THEN SUDDENLY THEY GAVE A SHOUT ALL TOGETHER AND DISAPPEARED IN A FLASH INTO THEIR VARIOUS HOUSES THE TOPS OF WHICH CLOSED WITH A SERIES OF POPS THAT SOUNDED LIKE A BUNCH OF FIRECRACKERS BEING EXPLODED
5045-1197-0043 THE ADVENTURERS NOW FOUND THEMSELVES ALONE AND DOROTHY ASKED ANXIOUSLY IS ANYBODY HURT NOT ME ANSWERED THE SCARECROW THEY HAVE GIVEN MY STRAW A GOOD SHAKING UP AND TAKEN ALL THE LUMPS OUT OF IT
5045-1197-0044 I AM NOW IN SPLENDID CONDITION AND AM REALLY OBLIGED TO THE TOTTENHOTS FOR THEIR KIND TREATMENT I FEEL MUCH THE SAME WAY SAID SCRAPS MY COTTON STUFFING HAD SAGGED A GOOD DEAL WITH THE DAY'S WALKING AND THEY'VE LOOSENED IT UP UNTIL I FEEL AS PLUMP AS A SAUSAGE
5045-1197-0045 BUT THE PLAY WAS A LITTLE ROUGH AND I'D HAD QUITE ENOUGH OF IT WHEN YOU INTERFERED SIX OF THEM SAT ON ME SAID OJO BUT AS THEY ARE SO LITTLE THEY DIDN'T HURT ME MUCH JUST THEN THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE IN FRONT OF THEM OPENED
5045-1197-0046 AND A TOTTENHOT STUCK HIS HEAD OUT VERY CAUTIOUSLY AND LOOKED AT THE STRANGERS CAN'T YOU TAKE A JOKE HE ASKED REPROACHFULLY HAVEN'T YOU ANY FUN IN YOU AT ALL IF I HAD SUCH A QUALITY REPLIED THE SCARECROW
5045-1197-0047 BUT I DON'T BEAR GRUDGES I FORGIVE YOU SO DO I ADDED SCRAPS THAT IS IF YOU BEHAVE YOURSELVES AFTER THIS IT WAS JUST A LITTLE ROUGH HOUSE THAT'S ALL SAID THE TOTTENHOT
5045-1197-0048 BUT IF YOU WILL BEHAVE WE CAN'T BE SHUT UP HERE ALL NIGHT BECAUSE THIS IS OUR TIME TO PLAY
5045-1197-0049 WELL YOU ENDED IT SO WE WON'T ARGUE THE MATTER MAY WE COME OUT AGAIN OR ARE YOU STILL CRUEL AND SLAPPY TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL DO SAID DOROTHY WE'RE ALL TIRED AND WANT TO SLEEP UNTIL MORNING
5045-1197-0050 IF YOU'LL LET US GET INTO YOUR HOUSE AND STAY THERE UNTIL DAYLIGHT
5045-1197-0051 CRIED THE TOTTENHOT EAGERLY AND HE GAVE A QUEER WHISTLE THAT BROUGHT HIS PEOPLE POPPING OUT OF THEIR HOUSES ON ALL SIDES WHEN THE HOUSE BEFORE THEM WAS VACANT DOROTHY AND OJO LEANED OVER THE HOLE AND LOOKED IN BUT COULD SEE NOTHING BECAUSE IT WAS SO DARK
5045-1197-0052 BUT IF THE TOTTENHOTS SLEPT THERE ALL DAY THE CHILDREN THOUGHT THEY COULD SLEEP THERE AT NIGHT SO OJO LOWERED HIMSELF DOWN AND FOUND IT WAS NOT VERY DEEP THERE'S A SOFT CUSHION ALL OVER
5045-1197-0053 DOROTHY HANDED TOTO TO THE BOY AND THEN CLIMBED IN HERSELF
5045-1197-0054 THEY DID NOT CLOSE THE HOLE IN THE ROOF BUT LEFT IT OPEN TO ADMIT AIR IT ALSO ADMITTED THE SHOUTS AND CEASELESS LAUGHTER OF THE IMPISH TOTTENHOTS AS THEY PLAYED OUTSIDE BUT DOROTHY AND OJO BEING WEARY FROM THEIR JOURNEY WERE SOON FAST ASLEEP
