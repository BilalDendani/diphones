5641-39772-0000 CHAPTER SIX HOW HEROD SLEW HYRCANUS AND THEN HASTED AWAY TO CAESAR AND OBTAINED THE KINGDOM FROM HIM ALSO AND HOW A LITTLE TIME AFTERWARD
5641-39772-0001 YET DID THERE COME UPON HIM A DANGER THAT WOULD HAZARD HIS ENTIRE DOMINIONS AFTER ANTONY HAD BEEN BEATEN AT THE BATTLE OF ACTIUM BY CAESAR OCTARIAN FOR AT THAT TIME BOTH HEROD'S ENEMIES AND FRIENDS DESPAIRED OF HIS AFFAIRS
5641-39772-0002 FOR IT WAS NOT PROBABLE THAT HE WOULD REMAIN WITHOUT PUNISHMENT WHO HAD SHOWED SO MUCH FRIENDSHIP FOR ANTONY SO IT HAPPENED THAT HIS FRIENDS DESPAIRED AND HAD NO HOPES OF HIS ESCAPE
5641-39772-0003 BUT FOR HIS ENEMIES THEY ALL OUTWARDLY APPEARED TO BE TROUBLED AT HIS CASE BUT WERE PRIVATELY VERY GLAD OF IT AS HOPING TO OBTAIN A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER AS FOR HEROD HIMSELF HE SAW THAT THERE WAS NO ONE OF ROYAL DIGNITY
5641-39772-0004 LEFT BUT HYRCANUS AND THEREFORE HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FOR HIS ADVANTAGE NOT TO SUFFER HIM TO BE AN OBSTACLE IN HIS WAY ANY LONGER FOR THAT IN CASE HE HIMSELF SURVIVED AND ESCAPED THE DANGER HE WAS IN HE THOUGHT
5641-39772-0005 AT SUCH JUNCTURES OF AFFAIRS AS WAS MORE WORTHY OF THE KINGDOM THAN HIMSELF AND IN CASE HE SHOULD BE SLAIN BY CAESAR HIS ENVY PROMPTED HIM TO DESIRE TO SLAY HIM
5641-39772-0006 THERE WAS A CERTAIN OCCASION AFFORDED HIM FOR HYRCANUS WAS OF SO MILD A TEMPER BOTH THEN
5641-39772-0007 NOR TO CONCERN HIMSELF WITH INNOVATIONS BUT LEFT ALL TO FORTUNE
5641-39772-0008 WAS A LOVER OF STRIFE AND WAS EXCEEDING DESIROUS OF A CHANGE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND SPAKE TO HER FATHER NOT TO BEAR FOR EVER HEROD'S INJURIOUS TREATMENT OF THEIR FAMILY BUT TO ANTICIPATE THEIR FUTURE HOPES AS HE SAFELY MIGHT
5641-39772-0009 AND DESIRED HIM TO WRITE ABOUT THESE MATTERS TO MALCHUS WHO WAS THEN GOVERNOR OF ARABIA TO RECEIVE THEM AND TO SECURE THEM FROM HEROD FOR THAT IF THEY WENT AWAY AND HEROD'S AFFAIRS PROVED TO BE
5641-39772-0010 AS IT WAS LIKELY THEY WOULD BE BY REASON OF CAESAR'S ENMITY TO HIM THEY SHOULD THEN BE THE ONLY PERSONS THAT COULD TAKE THE GOVERNMENT AND THIS BOTH ON ACCOUNT OF THE ROYAL FAMILY THEY WERE OF AND ON ACCOUNT OF THE GOOD DISPOSITION OF
5641-39772-0011 THE MULTITUDE TO THEM WHILE SHE USED THESE PERSUASIONS HYRCANUS PUT OFF HER SUIT BUT AS SHE SHOWED THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN AND A CONTENTIOUS WOMAN TOO AND WOULD NOT DESIST
5641-39772-0012 EITHER NIGHT OR DAY BUT WOULD ALWAYS BE SPEAKING TO HIM ABOUT THESE MATTERS AND ABOUT HEROD'S TREACHEROUS DESIGNS SHE AT LAST PREVAILED WITH HIM TO INTRUST
5641-39772-0013 WITH A LETTER WHEREIN HIS RESOLUTION WAS DECLARED AND HE DESIRED THE ARABIAN GOVERNOR TO SEND TO HIM SOME HORSEMEN WHO SHOULD RECEIVE HIM AND CONDUCT HIM TO THE LAKE ASPHALTITES WHICH IS FROM THE BOUNDS OF JERUSALEM THREE HUNDRED FURLONGS
5641-39772-0014 AND HE DID THEREFORE TRUST DOSITHEUS WITH THIS LETTER BECAUSE HE WAS A CAREFUL ATTENDANT ON HIM AND ON ALEXANDRA AND HAD NO SMALL OCCASIONS TO BEAR ILL WILL TO HEROD
5641-39772-0015 FOR HE WAS A KINSMAN OF ONE JOSEPH WHOM HE HAD SLAIN AND A BROTHER OF THOSE THAT WERE FORMERLY SLAIN AT TYRE BY ANTONY YET COULD NOT THESE MOTIVES INDUCE DOSITHEUS TO SERVE HYRCANUS IN THIS AFFAIR
5641-39772-0016 FOR PREFERRING THE HOPES HE HAD FROM THE PRESENT KING TO THOSE HE HAD FROM HIM HE GAVE HEROD THE LETTER SO HE TOOK HIS KINDNESS IN GOOD PART AND BID HIM BESIDES DO WHAT HE HAD ALREADY DONE THAT IS GO ON IN SERVING HIM BY ROLLING UP
5641-39772-0017 MALCHUS'S INTENTIONS ALSO
5641-39772-0018 THE ARABIAN GOVERNOR RETURNED BACK FOR ANSWER THAT HE WOULD RECEIVE HYRCANUS AND ALL THAT SHOULD COME WITH HIM AND EVEN ALL THE JEWS THAT WERE OF HIS PARTY THAT HE WOULD MOREOVER SEND FORCES SUFFICIENT TO SECURE THEM IN THEIR JOURNEY
5641-39772-0019 AND THAT HE SHOULD BE IN NO WANT OF ANY THING HE SHOULD DESIRE NOW AS SOON AS HEROD HAD RECEIVED THIS LETTER HE IMMEDIATELY SENT FOR HYRCANUS AND QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT THE LEAGUE HE HAD MADE WITH MALCHUS
5641-39772-0020 AND WHEN HE DENIED IT HE SHOWED HIS LETTER TO THE SANHEDRIM
5641-39772-0021 AS IT IS CONTAINED IN THE COMMENTARIES OF KING HEROD BUT OTHER HISTORIANS DO NOT AGREE WITH THEM FOR THEY SUPPOSE THAT HEROD DID NOT FIND BUT RATHER MAKE THIS AN OCCASION FOR THUS PUTTING HIM TO DEATH AND THAT BY TREACHEROUSLY LAYING A SNARE FOR HIM
5641-39772-0022 FOR THUS DO THEY WRITE THAT HEROD AND HE WERE ONCE AT A TREAT AND THAT HEROD HAD GIVEN NO OCCASION TO SUSPECT THAT HE WAS DISPLEASED AT HIM BUT PUT THIS QUESTION TO HYRCANUS
5641-39772-0023 WHETHER HE HAD RECEIVED ANY LETTERS FROM MALCHUS AND WHEN HE ANSWERED THAT HE HAD RECEIVED LETTERS BUT THOSE OF SALUTATION ONLY AND WHEN HE ASKED FURTHER WHETHER HE HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY PRESENTS FROM HIM
5641-39772-0024 AND WHEN HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE HAD RECEIVED NO MORE THAN FOUR HORSES TO RIDE ON WHICH MALCHUS HAD SENT HIM THEY PRETENDED THAT HEROD CHARGED THESE UPON HIM AS THE CRIMES OF BRIBERY AND TREASON AND GAVE ORDER THAT HE SHOULD BE LED AWAY AND SLAIN
5641-39772-0025 OF NO OFFENSE WHEN HE WAS THUS BROUGHT TO HIS END THEY ALLEGED HOW MILD HIS TEMPER HAD BEEN AND THAT EVEN IN HIS YOUTH HE HAD NEVER GIVEN ANY DEMONSTRATION OF BOLDNESS OR RASHNESS
5641-39772-0026 AND THAT THE CASE WAS THE SAME WHEN HE CAME TO BE KING BUT THAT HE EVEN THEN COMMITTED THE MANAGEMENT OF THE GREATEST PART OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS TO ANTIPATER AND THAT HE WAS NOW ABOVE FOURSCORE YEARS OLD
5641-39772-0027 AND KNEW THAT HEROD'S GOVERNMENT WAS IN A SECURE STATE HE ALSO CAME OVER EUPHRATES AND LEFT THOSE WHO GREATLY HONORED HIM BEYOND THAT RIVER
5641-39772-0028 OF INNOVATION AND NOT AT ALL AGREEABLE TO HIS TEMPER
5641-39772-0029 AND THUS DID HE END HIS LIFE AFTER HE HAD ENDURED VARIOUS AND MANIFOLD TURNS OF FORTUNE IN HIS LIFETIME FOR HE WAS MADE HIGH PRIEST OF THE JEWISH NATION
5641-39772-0030 ALEXANDRA'S REIGN WHO HELD THE GOVERNMENT NINE YEARS AND WHEN AFTER HIS MOTHER'S DEATH HE TOOK THE KINGDOM HIMSELF AND HELD IT THREE MONTHS HE LOST IT BY THE MEANS OF HIS BROTHER ARISTOBULUS
5641-39772-0031 AND ENJOYED THEM FORTY YEARS BUT WHEN HE WAS AGAIN DEPRIVED BY ANTIGONUS
5641-39772-0032 THE PARTHIANS AND THENCE RETURNED HOME AGAIN AFTER SOME TIME ON ACCOUNT OF THE HOPES THAT HEROD HAD GIVEN HIM NONE OF WHICH CAME TO PASS ACCORDING TO HIS EXPECTATION BUT HE STILL CONFLICTED WITH MANY MISFORTUNES
5641-39772-0033 AND WHAT WAS THE HEAVIEST CALAMITY OF ALL AS WE HAVE RELATED ALREADY HE CAME TO AN END WHICH WAS UNDESERVED BY HIM HIS CHARACTER APPEARED TO BE THAT OF A MAN OF A MILD AND MODERATE DISPOSITION
5641-39772-0034 AND SUFFERED THE ADMINISTRATION OF AFFAIRS TO BE GENERALLY DONE BY OTHERS UNDER HIM HE WAS AVERSE TO MUCH MEDDLING WITH THE PUBLIC NOR HAD SHREWDNESS ENOUGH TO GOVERN A KINGDOM AND BOTH ANTIPATER
5641-39772-0035 AND HEROD CAME TO THEIR GREATNESS BY REASON OF HIS MILDNESS AND AT LAST HE MET WITH SUCH AN END FROM THEM
5641-39772-0036 MADE HASTE TO CAESAR AND BECAUSE HE COULD NOT HAVE ANY HOPES OF KINDNESS FROM HIM ON ACCOUNT OF THE FRIENDSHIP HE HAD FOR ANTONY HE HAD A SUSPICION OF ALEXANDRA LEST SHE SHOULD TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BRING THE MULTITUDE TO A REVOLT
5641-39772-0037 AND INTRODUCE A SEDITION INTO THE AFFAIRS OF THE KINGDOM SO HE COMMITTED THE CARE OF EVERY THING TO HIS BROTHER PHERORAS AND PLACED HIS MOTHER CYPROS AND HIS SISTER SALOME AND THE WHOLE FAMILY AT MASADA
5641-39772-0038 HE SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THE GOVERNMENT
5641-39772-0039 BECAUSE OF THE MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN HER AND HIS SISTER AND HIS SISTER'S MOTHER WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO LIVE TOGETHER HE PLACED HER AT ALEXANDRIUM WITH ALEXANDRA HER MOTHER AND LEFT HIS TREASURER JOSEPH
5641-39772-0040 THEY ALSO HAD IT IN CHARGE THAT IF THEY SHOULD HEAR ANY MISCHIEF HAD BEFALLEN HIM THEY SHOULD KILL THEM BOTH AND AS FAR AS THEY WERE ABLE TO
5641-39772-0041 PRESERVE THE KINGDOM FOR HIS SONS AND FOR HIS BROTHER PHERORAS SIX WHEN HE HAD GIVEN THEM THIS CHARGE HE MADE HASTE TO RHODES TO MEET CAESAR AND WHEN HE HAD SAILED TO THAT CITY HE TOOK OFF HIS DIADEM BUT REMITTED NOTHING ELSE OF HIS USUAL DIGNITY
5641-39772-0042 AND WHEN UPON HIS MEETING HIM HE DESIRED THAT HE WOULD LET HIM SPEAK TO HIM HE THEREIN EXHIBITED A MUCH MORE NOBLE SPECIMEN OF A GREAT SOUL FOR HE DID NOT BETAKE HIMSELF TO SUPPLICATIONS AS MEN USUALLY DO UPON SUCH OCCASIONS
5641-39772-0043 NOR OFFERED HIM ANY PETITION AS IF HE WERE AN OFFENDER BUT AFTER AN UNDAUNTED MANNER GAVE AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE HAD DONE FOR HE SPAKE THUS TO CAESAR THAT HE HAD THE GREATEST FRIENDSHIP FOR ANTONY
5641-39772-0044 AND DID EVERY THING HE COULD THAT HE MIGHT ATTAIN THE GOVERNMENT THAT HE WAS NOT INDEED IN THE ARMY WITH HIM BECAUSE THE ARABIANS HAD DIVERTED HIM BUT THAT HE HAD SENT HIM BOTH MONEY AND CORN WHICH WAS BUT TOO LITTLE IN COMPARISON OF WHAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE FOR HIM
5641-39772-0045 TO BE A BENEFACTOR HE IS OBLIGED TO HAZARD EVERY THING TO USE EVERY FACULTY OF HIS SOUL EVERY MEMBER OF HIS BODY AND ALL THE WEALTH HE HATH FOR HIM IN WHICH I CONFESS I HAVE BEEN TOO DEFICIENT HOWEVER
5641-39772-0046 UPON HIS DEFEAT AT ACTIUM NOR UPON THE EVIDENT CHANGE OF HIS FORTUNE HAVE I TRANSFERRED MY HOPES FROM HIM TO ANOTHER BUT HAVE PRESERVED MYSELF THOUGH NOT AS A VALUABLE FELLOW SOLDIER YET CERTAINLY AS A FAITHFUL COUNSELOR
5641-39772-0047 TO ANTONY WHEN I DEMONSTRATED TO HIM THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT HE HAD TO SAVE HIMSELF AND NOT TO LOSE ALL HIS AUTHORITY WAS TO SLAY CLEOPATRA FOR WHEN SHE WAS ONCE DEAD THERE WOULD BE ROOM FOR HIM TO RETAIN HIS AUTHORITY
5641-39772-0048 AND RATHER TO BRING THEE TO MAKE A COMPOSITION WITH HIM THAN TO CONTINUE AT ENMITY ANY LONGER NONE OF WHICH ADVISES WOULD HE ATTEND TO BUT PREFERRED HIS OWN RASH RESOLUTION BEFORE THEM WHICH HAVE HAPPENED UNPROFITABLY FOR HIM
5641-39772-0049 BUT PROFITABLY FOR THEE NOW THEREFORE IN CASE THOU DETERMINEST ABOUT ME AND MY ALACRITY IN SERVING ANTONY ACCORDING TO THY ANGER AT HIM
5641-39772-0050 NOR WILL I BE ASHAMED TO OWN AND THAT PUBLICLY TOO THAT I HAD A GREAT KINDNESS FOR HIM
5641-39772-0051 THAT WE SHALL DO AND BE THE SAME TO THYSELF FOR IT IS BUT CHANGING THE NAMES AND THE FIRMNESS OF FRIENDSHIP THAT WE SHALL BEAR TO THEE
5641-39772-0052 PROCURED HIM CAESAR'S GOOD WILL ACCORDINGLY
5641-39772-0053 AS HE HAD BEEN TO ANTONY AND THEN HAD HIM IN GREAT ESTEEM
5641-39772-0054 HAD VERY READILY ASSISTED HIM IN THE AFFAIR OF THE GLADIATORS SO WHEN HE HAD OBTAINED SUCH A KIND RECEPTION AND HAD BEYOND ALL HIS HOPES PROCURED HIS CROWN TO BE MORE ENTIRELY AND FIRMLY SETTLED UPON HIM THAN EVER BY CAESAR'S DONATION
5641-39772-0055 AS WELL AS BY THAT DECREE OF THE ROMANS WHICH CAESAR TOOK CARE TO PROCURE FOR HIS GREATER SECURITY HE CONDUCTED CAESAR ON HIS WAY TO EGYPT AND MADE PRESENTS EVEN BEYOND HIS ABILITY TO BOTH HIM AND HIS FRIENDS AND IN GENERAL BEHAVED HIMSELF WITH GREAT
5641-39772-0056 MAGNANIMITY HE ALSO DESIRED THAT CAESAR WOULD NOT PUT TO DEATH ONE ALEXANDER WHO HAD BEEN A COMPANION OF ANTONY BUT CAESAR HAD SWORN TO PUT HIM TO DEATH AND SO HE COULD NOT OBTAIN THAT HIS PETITION
5641-39772-0057 AND NOW HE RETURNED TO JUDEA AGAIN WITH GREATER HONOR AND ASSURANCE THAN EVER AND AFFRIGHTED THOSE
5641-39772-0058 AS STILL ACQUIRING FROM HIS VERY DANGERS GREATER SPLENDOR THAN BEFORE BY THE FAVOR OF GOD TO HIM SO HE PREPARED FOR THE RECEPTION OF CAESAR AS HE WAS GOING OUT OF SYRIA TO INVADE EGYPT AND WHEN HE CAME HE ENTERTAINED HIM AT PTOLEMAIS
5641-39772-0059 HE ALSO BESTOWED PRESENTS ON THE ARMY AND BROUGHT THEM PROVISIONS IN ABUNDANCE HE ALSO PROVED TO BE ONE OF CAESAR'S MOST CORDIAL FRIENDS AND PUT THE ARMY IN ARRAY AND RODE ALONG WITH CAESAR
5641-39772-0060 AND HAD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN WELL APPOINTED IN ALL RESPECTS AFTER A RICH AND SUMPTUOUS MANNER FOR THE BETTER RECEPTION OF HIM AND HIS FRIENDS HE ALSO PROVIDED THEM WITH WHAT THEY SHOULD WANT AS THEY PASSED OVER THE DRY DESERT INSOMUCH THAT THEY LACKED
5641-39772-0061 NEITHER WINE NOR WATER WHICH LAST THE SOLDIERS STOOD IN THE GREATEST NEED OF AND BESIDES HE PRESENTED CAESAR
5641-39772-0062 THE GOOD WILL OF THEM ALL BECAUSE HE WAS ASSISTING TO THEM IN A MUCH GREATER AND MORE SPLENDID DEGREE THAN THE KINGDOM HE HAD OBTAINED COULD AFFORD BY WHICH MEANS HE MORE AND MORE DEMONSTRATED TO CAESAR THE FIRMNESS OF HIS FRIENDSHIP
