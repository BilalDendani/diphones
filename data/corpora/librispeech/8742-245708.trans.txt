8742-245708-0000 FOUR WHETHER THE IMAGE OF GOD IS IN EVERY MAN FIVE WHETHER THE IMAGE OF GOD IS IN MAN BY COMPARISON WITH THE ESSENCE OR WITH ALL THE DIVINE PERSONS OR WITH ONE OF THEM
8742-245708-0001 SIX WHETHER THE IMAGE OF GOD IS IN MAN AS TO HIS MIND ONLY SEVEN WHETHER THE IMAGE OF GOD IS IN MAN'S POWER OR IN HIS HABITS AND ACTS EIGHT WHETHER THE IMAGE OF GOD IS IN MAN BY COMPARISON WITH EVERY OBJECT
8742-245708-0002 NINE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IMAGE AND LIKENESS FIRST ARTICLE
8742-245708-0003 WHETHER THE IMAGE OF GOD IS IN MAN OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE IMAGE OF GOD IS NOT IN MAN FOR IT IS WRITTEN
8742-245708-0004 TO WHOM HAVE YOU LIKENED GOD OR WHAT IMAGE WILL YOU MAKE FOR HIM
8742-245708-0005 FURTHER TO BE THE IMAGE OF GOD IS THE PROPERTY OF THE FIRST BEGOTTEN OF WHOM THE APOSTLE SAYS
8742-245708-0006 BUT THERE IS NO SPECIES COMMON TO BOTH GOD AND MAN NOR CAN THERE BE A COMPARISON OF EQUALITY BETWEEN GOD AND MAN THEREFORE THERE CAN BE NO IMAGE OF GOD IN MAN ON THE CONTRARY IT IS WRITTEN
8742-245708-0007 LET US MAKE MAN TO OUR OWN IMAGE AND LIKENESS
8742-245708-0008 WHERE AN IMAGE EXISTS THERE FORTHWITH IS LIKENESS BUT WHERE THERE IS LIKENESS THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY AN IMAGE HENCE IT IS CLEAR THAT LIKENESS IS ESSENTIAL TO AN IMAGE AND THAT AN IMAGE ADDS SOMETHING TO LIKENESS
8742-245708-0009 NAMELY THAT IT IS COPIED FROM SOMETHING ELSE FOR AN IMAGE IS SO CALLED BECAUSE IT IS PRODUCED AS AN IMITATION OF SOMETHING ELSE WHEREFORE FOR INSTANCE AN EGG HOWEVER MUCH LIKE AND EQUAL TO ANOTHER EGG
8742-245708-0010 IS NOT CALLED AN IMAGE OF THE OTHER EGG BECAUSE IT IS NOT COPIED FROM IT BUT EQUALITY DOES NOT BELONG TO THE ESSENCE OF AN IMAGE
8742-245708-0011 WHERE THERE IS AN IMAGE THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY EQUALITY AS WE SEE IN A PERSON'S IMAGE REFLECTED IN A GLASS YET THIS IS OF THE ESSENCE OF A PERFECT IMAGE
8742-245708-0012 FOR IN A PERFECT IMAGE NOTHING IS WANTING THAT IS TO BE FOUND IN THAT OF WHICH IT IS A COPY NOW IT IS MANIFEST THAT IN MAN THERE IS SOME LIKENESS TO GOD COPIED FROM GOD AS FROM AN EXEMPLAR YET THIS LIKENESS IS NOT ONE OF EQUALITY
8742-245708-0013 FOR SUCH AN EXEMPLAR INFINITELY EXCELS ITS COPY THEREFORE THERE IS IN MAN A LIKENESS TO GOD NOT INDEED A PERFECT LIKENESS BUT IMPERFECT
8742-245708-0014 AND SCRIPTURE IMPLIES THE SAME WHEN IT SAYS THAT MAN WAS MADE TO GOD'S LIKENESS FOR THE PREPOSITION TO SIGNIFIES A CERTAIN APPROACH AS OF SOMETHING AT A DISTANCE
8742-245708-0015 THE PROPHET SPEAKS OF BODILY IMAGES MADE BY MAN THEREFORE HE SAYS POINTEDLY WHAT IMAGE WILL YOU MAKE FOR HIM BUT GOD MADE A SPIRITUAL IMAGE TO HIMSELF IN MAN
8742-245708-0016 THE FIRST BORN OF CREATURES IS THE PERFECT IMAGE OF GOD REFLECTING PERFECTLY THAT OF WHICH HE IS THE IMAGE AND SO HE IS SAID TO BE THE IMAGE AND NEVER TO THE IMAGE
8742-245708-0017 BUT MAN IS SAID TO BE BOTH IMAGE BY REASON OF THE LIKENESS AND TO THE IMAGE BY REASON OF THE IMPERFECT LIKENESS AND SINCE THE PERFECT LIKENESS TO GOD CANNOT BE EXCEPT IN AN IDENTICAL NATURE
8742-245708-0018 THE IMAGE OF GOD EXISTS IN HIS FIRST BORN SON AS THE IMAGE OF THE KING IS IN HIS SON WHO IS OF THE SAME NATURE AS HIMSELF WHEREAS IT EXISTS IN MAN AS IN AN ALIEN NATURE AS THE IMAGE OF THE KING IS IN A SILVER COIN
8742-245708-0019 AS UNITY MEANS ABSENCE OF DIVISION A SPECIES IS SAID TO BE THE SAME AS FAR AS IT IS ONE NOW A THING IS SAID TO BE ONE NOT ONLY NUMERICALLY SPECIFICALLY OR GENERICALLY BUT ALSO ACCORDING TO A CERTAIN ANALOGY OR PROPORTION
8742-245708-0020 IN THIS SENSE A CREATURE IS ONE WITH GOD OR LIKE TO HIM BUT WHEN HILARY SAYS OF A THING WHICH ADEQUATELY REPRESENTS ANOTHER THIS IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD OF A PERFECT IMAGE SECOND ARTICLE
8742-245708-0021 WHETHER THE IMAGE OF GOD IS TO BE FOUND IN IRRATIONAL CREATURES OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE IMAGE OF GOD IS TO BE FOUND IN IRRATIONAL CREATURES FOR DIONYSIUS SAYS
8742-245708-0022 BUT GOD IS THE CAUSE NOT ONLY OF RATIONAL BUT ALSO OF IRRATIONAL CREATURES THEREFORE THE IMAGE OF GOD IS TO BE FOUND IN IRRATIONAL CREATURES
8742-245708-0023 FURTHER THE MORE DISTINCT A LIKENESS IS THE NEARER IT APPROACHES TO THE NATURE OF AN IMAGE
8742-245708-0024 FURTHER THE MORE PERFECT ANYTHING IS IN GOODNESS THE MORE IT IS LIKE GOD BUT THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IS MORE PERFECT IN GOODNESS THAN MAN FOR THOUGH EACH INDIVIDUAL THING IS GOOD ALL THINGS TOGETHER ARE CALLED VERY GOOD
8742-245708-0025 THEREFORE THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IS TO THE IMAGE OF GOD AND NOT ONLY MAN
8742-245708-0026 FURTHER BOETHIUS
8742-245708-0027 SAYS OF GOD HOLDING THE WORLD IN HIS MIND AND FORMING IT INTO HIS IMAGE THEREFORE THE WHOLE WORLD IS TO THE IMAGE OF GOD AND NOT ONLY THE RATIONAL CREATURE ON THE CONTRARY AUGUSTINE SAYS
8742-245708-0028 MAN'S EXCELLENCE CONSISTS IN THE FACT THAT GOD MADE HIM TO HIS OWN IMAGE BY GIVING HIM AN INTELLECTUAL SOUL WHICH RAISES HIM ABOVE THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD THEREFORE THINGS WITHOUT INTELLECT ARE NOT MADE TO GOD'S IMAGE
8742-245708-0029 I ANSWER THAT NOT EVERY LIKENESS NOT EVEN WHAT IS COPIED FROM SOMETHING ELSE IS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE AN IMAGE FOR IF THE LIKENESS BE ONLY GENERIC OR EXISTING BY VIRTUE OF SOME COMMON ACCIDENT
8742-245708-0030 THUS THE IMAGE OF THE KING EXISTS IN HIS SON OR AT LEAST IN SOME SPECIFIC ACCIDENT AND CHIEFLY IN THE SHAPE THUS WE SPEAK OF A MAN'S IMAGE IN COPPER
8742-245708-0031 WHENCE HILARY SAYS POINTEDLY THAT AN IMAGE IS OF THE SAME SPECIES NOW IT IS MANIFEST THAT SPECIFIC LIKENESS FOLLOWS THE ULTIMATE DIFFERENCE BUT SOME THINGS ARE LIKE TO GOD FIRST AND MOST COMMONLY BECAUSE THEY EXIST
8742-245708-0032 SECONDLY BECAUSE THEY LIVE AND THIRDLY BECAUSE THEY KNOW OR UNDERSTAND AND THESE LAST AS AUGUSTINE SAYS
8742-245708-0033 APPROACH SO NEAR TO GOD IN LIKENESS THAT AMONG ALL CREATURES NOTHING COMES NEARER TO HIM IT IS CLEAR THEREFORE THAT INTELLECTUAL CREATURES ALONE PROPERLY SPEAKING ARE MADE TO GOD'S IMAGE
8742-245708-0034 SO DIONYSIUS SAYS THAT EFFECTS ARE CONTINGENT IMAGES OF THEIR CAUSES THAT IS AS MUCH AS THEY HAPPEN CONTINGIT TO BE SO BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY
8742-245708-0035 DIONYSIUS COMPARES THE SOLAR RAY TO DIVINE GOODNESS AS REGARDS ITS CAUSALITY NOT AS REGARDS ITS NATURAL DIGNITY WHICH IS INVOLVED IN THE IDEA OF AN IMAGE
8742-245708-0036 THE UNIVERSE IS MORE PERFECT IN GOODNESS THAN THE INTELLECTUAL CREATURE AS REGARDS EXTENSION AND DIFFUSION BUT INTENSIVELY AND COLLECTIVELY THE LIKENESS TO THE DIVINE GOODNESS IS FOUND RATHER IN THE INTELLECTUAL CREATURE
8742-245708-0037 WHICH HAS A CAPACITY FOR THE HIGHEST GOOD OR ELSE WE MAY SAY THAT A PART IS NOT RIGHTLY DIVIDED AGAINST THE WHOLE BUT ONLY AGAINST ANOTHER PART WHEREFORE WHEN WE SAY THAT THE INTELLECTUAL NATURE ALONE IS TO THE IMAGE OF GOD
8742-245708-0038 WE DO NOT MEAN THAT THE UNIVERSE IN ANY PART IS NOT TO GOD'S IMAGE BUT THAT THE OTHER PARTS ARE EXCLUDED
8742-245708-0039 BOETHIUS HERE USES THE WORD IMAGE TO EXPRESS THE LIKENESS WHICH THE PRODUCT OF AN ART BEARS TO THE ARTISTIC SPECIES IN THE MIND OF THE ARTIST THUS EVERY CREATURE IS AN IMAGE OF THE EXEMPLAR TYPE THEREOF IN THE DIVINE MIND
8742-245708-0040 WHETHER THE ANGELS ARE MORE TO THE IMAGE OF GOD THAN MAN IS OBJECTION ONE
8742-245708-0041 FURTHER ACCORDING TO AUGUSTINE
8742-245708-0042 THEREFORE THE ANGELS ARE NOT MORE TO THE IMAGE OF GOD THAN MAN
8742-245708-0043 I ANSWER THAT WE MAY SPEAK OF GOD'S IMAGE IN TWO WAYS FIRST WE MAY CONSIDER IN IT THAT IN WHICH THE IMAGE CHIEFLY CONSISTS THAT IS THE INTELLECTUAL NATURE
8742-245708-0044 AND ALSO IN THE FACT THAT THE WHOLE HUMAN SOUL IS IN THE WHOLE BODY AND AGAIN IN EVERY PART AS GOD IS IN REGARD TO THE WHOLE WORLD IN THESE AND THE LIKE THINGS THE IMAGE OF GOD IS MORE PERFECT IN MAN THAN IT IS IN THE ANGELS
8742-245708-0045 BUT THESE DO NOT OF THEMSELVES BELONG TO THE NATURE OF THE DIVINE IMAGE IN MAN UNLESS WE PRESUPPOSE THE FIRST LIKENESS WHICH IS IN THE INTELLECTUAL NATURE OTHERWISE EVEN BRUTE ANIMALS WOULD BE TO GOD'S IMAGE
8742-245708-0046 AS FIRE IS SAID TO BE SPECIFICALLY THE MOST SUBTLE OF BODIES WHILE NEVERTHELESS ONE KIND OF FIRE IS MORE SUBTLE THAN ANOTHER SO WE SAY THAT NOTHING IS MORE LIKE TO GOD THAN THE HUMAN SOUL IN ITS GENERIC AND INTELLECTUAL NATURE
8742-245708-0047 BECAUSE AS AUGUSTINE HAD SAID PREVIOUSLY THINGS WHICH HAVE KNOWLEDGE ARE SO NEAR TO HIM IN LIKENESS THAT OF ALL CREATURES NONE ARE NEARER WHEREFORE THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE ANGELS ARE NOT MORE TO GOD'S IMAGE
8742-245708-0048 WHEN WE SAY THAT SUBSTANCE DOES NOT ADMIT OF MORE OR LESS WE DO NOT MEAN THAT ONE SPECIES OF SUBSTANCE IS NOT MORE PERFECT THAN ANOTHER BUT THAT ONE AND THE SAME INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN ITS SPECIFIC NATURE AT ONE TIME MORE THAN AT ANOTHER
8742-245708-0049 FURTHER LIKENESS BELONGS TO THE NATURE OF THE IMAGE AS ABOVE EXPLAINED
8742-245708-0050 BUT BY SIN MAN BECOMES UNLIKE GOD THEREFORE HE LOSES THE IMAGE OF GOD ON THE CONTRARY IT IS WRITTEN
8742-245708-0051 SURELY MAN PASSETH AS AN IMAGE I ANSWER THAT SINCE MAN IS SAID TO BE THE IMAGE OF GOD BY REASON OF HIS INTELLECTUAL NATURE
8742-245708-0052 HE IS THE MOST PERFECTLY LIKE GOD ACCORDING TO THAT IN WHICH HE CAN BEST IMITATE GOD IN HIS INTELLECTUAL NATURE NOW THE INTELLECTUAL NATURE IMITATES GOD CHIEFLY IN THIS THAT GOD UNDERSTANDS AND LOVES HIMSELF
8742-245708-0053 WHEREFORE WE SEE THAT THE IMAGE OF GOD IS IN MAN IN THREE WAYS FIRST INASMUCH AS MAN POSSESSES A NATURAL APTITUDE FOR UNDERSTANDING AND LOVING GOD
8742-245708-0054 AND THIS APTITUDE CONSISTS IN THE VERY NATURE OF THE MIND WHICH IS COMMON TO ALL MEN SECONDLY INASMUCH AS MAN ACTUALLY AND HABITUALLY KNOWS AND LOVES GOD THOUGH IMPERFECTLY
8742-245708-0055 THE GLOSS DISTINGUISHES A THREEFOLD IMAGE OF CREATION OF RE CREATION AND OF LIKENESS THE FIRST IS FOUND IN ALL MEN THE SECOND ONLY IN THE JUST
8742-245708-0056 THE IMAGE OF GOD IN ITS PRINCIPAL SIGNIFICATION NAMELY THE INTELLECTUAL NATURE IS FOUND BOTH IN MAN AND IN WOMAN HENCE AFTER THE WORDS TO THE IMAGE OF GOD HE CREATED HIM IT IS ADDED MALE AND FEMALE HE CREATED THEM
8742-245708-0057 LEST IT SHOULD BE THOUGHT THAT BOTH SEXES WERE UNITED IN ONE INDIVIDUAL BUT IN A SECONDARY SENSE THE IMAGE OF GOD IS FOUND IN MAN AND NOT IN WOMAN FOR MAN IS THE BEGINNING AND END OF WOMAN
8742-245708-0058 THESE REASONS REFER TO THE IMAGE CONSISTING IN THE CONFORMITY OF GRACE AND GLORY FIFTH ARTICLE
8742-245708-0059 WHETHER THE IMAGE OF GOD IS IN MAN ACCORDING TO THE TRINITY OF PERSONS OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE IMAGE OF GOD DOES NOT EXIST IN MAN AS TO THE TRINITY OF PERSONS FOR AUGUSTINE SAYS
8742-245708-0060 AND ONE IS THE IMAGE TO WHICH MAN WAS MADE AND HILARY
8742-245708-0061 THEREFORE THE IMAGE OF GOD IN MAN IS OF THE DIVINE ESSENCE AND NOT OF THE TRINITY OF PERSONS
8742-245708-0062 FURTHER IT IS SAID DE
8742-245708-0063 THEREFORE THE IMAGE OF GOD IN MAN REGARDS NOT THE TRINITY OF PERSONS BUT THE UNITY OF THE ESSENCE
8742-245708-0064 FURTHER AN IMAGE LEADS TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THAT OF WHICH IT IS THE IMAGE THEREFORE IF THERE IS IN MAN THE IMAGE OF GOD AS TO THE TRINITY OF PERSONS SINCE MAN CAN KNOW HIMSELF BY HIS NATURAL REASON
8742-245708-0065 IT FOLLOWS THAT BY HIS NATURAL KNOWLEDGE MAN COULD KNOW THE TRINITY OF THE DIVINE PERSONS WHICH IS UNTRUE AS WAS SHOWN ABOVE QUESTION THIRTY TWO
8742-245708-0066 FURTHER THE NAME OF IMAGE IS NOT APPLICABLE TO ANY OF THE THREE PERSONS BUT ONLY TO THE SON FOR AUGUSTINE SAYS
8742-245708-0067 THE PLURALITY OF THE DIVINE PERSONS IS PROVED FROM THE FACT THAT MAN IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE IMAGE OF GOD I ANSWER THAT AS WE HAVE SEEN QUESTION FORTY
8742-245708-0068 AND THEREFORE TO BE TO THE IMAGE OF GOD BY IMITATION OF THE DIVINE NATURE DOES NOT EXCLUDE BEING TO THE SAME IMAGE BY THE REPRESENTATION OF THE DIVINE PERSONS BUT RATHER ONE FOLLOWS FROM THE OTHER
8742-245708-0069 WE MUST THEREFORE SAY THAT IN MAN THERE EXISTS THE IMAGE OF GOD BOTH AS REGARDS THE DIVINE NATURE AND AS REGARDS THE TRINITY OF PERSONS FOR ALSO IN GOD HIMSELF THERE IS ONE NATURE IN THREE PERSONS
8742-245708-0070 THUS IT IS CLEAR HOW TO SOLVE THE FIRST TWO OBJECTIONS
8742-245708-0071 THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TRINITY WITHIN OURSELVES AND THE DIVINE TRINITY THEREFORE AS HE THERE SAYS WE SEE RATHER THAN BELIEVE THE TRINITY WHICH IS IN OURSELVES WHEREAS WE BELIEVE RATHER THAN SEE THAT GOD IS TRINITY
8742-245708-0072 SOME HAVE SAID THAT IN MAN THERE IS AN IMAGE OF THE SON ONLY AUGUSTINE REJECTS THIS OPINION
8742-245708-0073 FIRST BECAUSE AS THE SON IS LIKE TO THE FATHER BY A LIKENESS OF ESSENCE IT WOULD FOLLOW OF NECESSITY IF MAN WERE MADE IN LIKENESS TO THE SON THAT HE IS MADE TO THE LIKENESS OF THE FATHER SECONDLY
8742-245708-0074 BECAUSE IF MAN WERE MADE ONLY TO THE IMAGE OF THE SON THE FATHER WOULD NOT HAVE SAID LET US MAKE MAN TO OUR OWN IMAGE AND LIKENESS BUT TO THY IMAGE WHEN THEREFORE IT IS WRITTEN HE MADE HIM TO THE IMAGE OF GOD
8742-245708-0075 THE SENSE IS NOT THAT THE FATHER MADE MAN TO THE IMAGE OF THE SON ONLY WHO IS GOD AS SOME EXPLAINED IT BUT THAT THE DIVINE TRINITY MADE MAN TO ITS IMAGE THAT IS OF THE WHOLE TRINITY
8742-245708-0076 WHEN IT IS SAID THAT GOD MADE MAN TO HIS IMAGE THIS CAN BE UNDERSTOOD IN TWO WAYS FIRST SO THAT THIS PREPOSITION TO POINTS TO THE TERM OF THE MAKING AND THEN THE SENSE IS
8742-245708-0077 LET US MAKE MAN IN SUCH A WAY THAT OUR IMAGE MAY BE IN HIM SECONDLY THIS PREPOSITION TO MAY POINT TO THE EXEMPLAR CAUSE AS WHEN WE SAY THIS BOOK IS MADE LIKE TO THAT ONE
