29-123032-0000 A HUMBUG MY MASTER WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY SUITED BUT IN A FEW DAYS
29-123032-0001 IN FACT HE DID A GREAT DEAL OF STROKING AND PATTING
29-123032-0002 HE ALWAYS BRUSHED MY MANE AND TAIL WITH WATER AND MY HOOFS WITH OIL BEFORE HE BROUGHT ME TO THE DOOR TO MAKE ME LOOK SMART
29-123032-0003 OR GROOMING ME THOROUGHLY HE THOUGHT NO MORE OF THAT THAN IF I HAD BEEN A COW HE LEFT MY BIT RUSTY MY SADDLE DAMP AND MY CRUPPER STIFF ALFRED SMIRK
29-123032-0004 CONSIDERED HIMSELF VERY HANDSOME HE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME ABOUT HIS HAIR WHISKERS AND NECKTIE BEFORE A LITTLE LOOKING GLASS IN THE HARNESS ROOM WHEN HIS MASTER WAS SPEAKING TO HIM IT WAS ALWAYS YES SIR
29-123032-0005 TOUCHING HIS HAT AT EVERY WORD
29-123032-0006 WHILE THE STRONG VAPORS THAT ROSE MADE MY EYES SMART AND INFLAME AND I DID NOT FEEL THE SAME APPETITE FOR MY FOOD ONE DAY HIS MASTER CAME IN AND SAID ALFRED THE STABLE SMELLS RATHER STRONG
29-123032-0007 WELL SIR HE SAID TOUCHING HIS CAP I'LL DO SO IF YOU PLEASE SIR BUT IT IS RATHER DANGEROUS SIR THROWING DOWN WATER IN A HORSE'S BOX THEY ARE VERY APT TO TAKE COLD SIR I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO HIM AN INJURY
29-123032-0008 BUT I'LL DO IT IF YOU PLEASE SIR WELL SAID HIS MASTER I SHOULD NOT LIKE HIM TO TAKE COLD BUT I DON'T LIKE THE SMELL OF THIS STABLE DO YOU THINK THE DRAINS ARE ALL RIGHT WELL SIR NOW YOU MENTION IT
29-123032-0009 I THINK THE DRAIN DOES SOMETIMES SEND BACK A SMELL THERE MAY BE SOMETHING WRONG SIR
29-123032-0010 SAID HIS MASTER YES SIR I WILL THE BRICKLAYER CAME AND PULLED UP A GREAT MANY BRICKS BUT FOUND NOTHING AMISS SO HE PUT DOWN SOME LIME AND CHARGED THE MASTER FIVE SHILLINGS
29-123032-0011 I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THIS HORSE HE GOES VERY FUMBLE FOOTED I AM SOMETIMES AFRAID HE WILL STUMBLE YES SIR SAID ALFRED I HAVE NOTICED THE SAME MYSELF WHEN I HAVE EXERCISED HIM
29-123032-0012 NOW THE FACT WAS THAT HE HARDLY EVER DID EXERCISE ME AND WHEN THE MASTER WAS BUSY I OFTEN STOOD FOR DAYS TOGETHER WITHOUT STRETCHING MY LEGS AT ALL AND YET BEING FED JUST AS HIGH AS IF I WERE AT HARD WORK
29-123032-0013 THIS OFTEN DISORDERED MY HEALTH AND MADE ME SOMETIMES HEAVY AND DULL BUT MORE OFTEN RESTLESS AND FEVERISH HE NEVER EVEN GAVE ME A MEAL OF GREEN FOOD OR A BRAN MASH WHICH WOULD HAVE COOLED ME
29-123032-0014 FOR HE WAS ALTOGETHER AS IGNORANT AS HE WAS CONCEITED AND THEN INSTEAD OF EXERCISE OR CHANGE OF FOOD I HAD TO TAKE HORSE BALLS AND DRAUGHTS WHICH BESIDE THE NUISANCE OF HAVING THEM POURED DOWN MY THROAT
29-123032-0015 USED TO MAKE ME FEEL ILL AND UNCOMFORTABLE ONE DAY MY FEET WERE SO TENDER
29-123032-0016 I MADE TWO SUCH SERIOUS STUMBLES THAT AS HE CAME DOWN LANSDOWN INTO THE CITY HE STOPPED AT THE FARRIER'S AND ASKED HIM TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH ME
29-123032-0017 THE MAN TOOK UP MY FEET ONE BY ONE AND EXAMINED THEM THEN STANDING UP AND DUSTING HIS HANDS ONE AGAINST THE OTHER HE SAID YOUR HORSE HAS GOT THE THRUSH AND BADLY TOO
29-123032-0018 HIS FEET ARE VERY TENDER IT IS FORTUNATE THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN DOWN I WONDER YOUR GROOM HAS NOT SEEN TO IT BEFORE THIS IS THE SORT OF THING WE FIND IN FOUL STABLES WHERE THE LITTER IS NEVER PROPERLY CLEANED OUT IF YOU WILL SEND HIM HERE TO MORROW
29-123032-0019 I WILL ATTEND TO THE HOOF AND I WILL DIRECT YOUR MAN HOW TO APPLY THE LINIMENT WHICH I WILL GIVE HIM THE NEXT DAY I HAD MY FEET THOROUGHLY CLEANSED AND STUFFED WITH TOW SOAKED IN SOME STRONG LOTION
29-123032-0020 THE FARRIER ORDERED ALL THE LITTER TO BE TAKEN OUT OF MY BOX DAY BY DAY AND THE FLOOR KEPT VERY CLEAN THEN I WAS TO HAVE BRAN MASHES A LITTLE GREEN FOOD AND NOT SO MUCH CORN
29-123032-0021 TILL MY FEET WERE WELL AGAIN WITH THIS TREATMENT I SOON REGAINED MY SPIRITS BUT MISTER BARRY WAS SO MUCH DISGUSTED AT BEING TWICE DECEIVED BY HIS GROOMS THAT HE DETERMINED TO GIVE UP KEEPING A HORSE
29-123032-0022 AND TO HIRE WHEN HE WANTED ONE I WAS THEREFORE KEPT TILL MY FEET WERE QUITE SOUND
