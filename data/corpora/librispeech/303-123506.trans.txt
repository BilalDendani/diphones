303-123506-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT A FAIR CAPTIVE FROM THE SKY THE THIRD DAY AFTER THE INCUBATOR CEREMONY WE SET FORTH TOWARD HOME BUT SCARCELY HAD THE HEAD OF THE PROCESSION DEBOUCHED INTO THE OPEN GROUND BEFORE THE CITY
303-123506-0001 THAN ORDERS WERE GIVEN FOR AN IMMEDIATE AND HASTY RETURN AS THOUGH TRAINED FOR YEARS IN THIS PARTICULAR EVOLUTION THE GREEN MARTIANS MELTED LIKE MIST INTO THE SPACIOUS DOORWAYS OF THE NEARBY BUILDINGS UNTIL IN LESS THAN THREE MINUTES
303-123506-0002 THE ENTIRE CAVALCADE OF CHARIOTS MASTODONS AND MOUNTED WARRIORS WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN SOLA AND I HAD ENTERED A BUILDING UPON THE FRONT OF THE CITY IN FACT THE SAME ONE IN WHICH I HAD HAD MY ENCOUNTER WITH THE APES AND WISHING TO SEE WHAT HAD CAUSED THE SUDDEN RETREAT
303-123506-0003 I MOUNTED TO AN UPPER FLOOR AND PEERED FROM THE WINDOW OUT OVER THE VALLEY AND THE HILLS BEYOND AND THERE I SAW THE CAUSE OF THEIR SUDDEN SCURRYING TO COVER A HUGE CRAFT LONG LOW AND GRAY PAINTED SWUNG SLOWLY OVER THE CREST OF THE NEAREST HILL
303-123506-0004 EACH CARRIED A STRANGE BANNER SWUNG FROM STEM TO STERN ABOVE THE UPPER WORKS AND UPON THE PROW OF EACH WAS PAINTED SOME ODD DEVICE THAT GLEAMED IN THE SUNLIGHT AND SHOWED PLAINLY EVEN AT THE DISTANCE AT WHICH WE WERE FROM THE VESSELS
303-123506-0005 I COULD SEE FIGURES CROWDING THE FORWARD DECKS AND UPPER WORKS OF THE AIR CRAFT WHETHER THEY HAD DISCOVERED US OR SIMPLY WERE LOOKING AT THE DESERTED CITY I COULD NOT SAY BUT IN ANY EVENT THEY RECEIVED A RUDE RECEPTION FOR SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT WARNING
303-123506-0006 THE GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS FIRED A TERRIFIC VOLLEY FROM THE WINDOWS OF THE BUILDINGS FACING THE LITTLE VALLEY ACROSS WHICH THE GREAT SHIPS WERE SO PEACEFULLY ADVANCING INSTANTLY THE SCENE CHANGED AS BY MAGIC
303-123506-0007 THE FOREMOST VESSEL SWUNG BROADSIDE TOWARD US AND BRINGING HER GUNS INTO PLAY RETURNED OUR FIRE AT THE SAME TIME MOVING PARALLEL TO OUR FRONT FOR A SHORT DISTANCE AND THEN TURNING BACK WITH THE EVIDENT INTENTION OF COMPLETING A GREAT CIRCLE WHICH WOULD BRING HER UP TO POSITION ONCE MORE OPPOSITE OUR FIRING LINE
303-123506-0008 THE OTHER VESSELS FOLLOWED IN HER WAKE EACH ONE OPENING UPON US AS SHE SWUNG INTO POSITION OUR OWN FIRE NEVER DIMINISHED AND I DOUBT IF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF OUR SHOTS WENT WILD
303-123506-0009 WHILE THE BANNERS AND UPPER WORKS DISSOLVED IN SPURTS OF FLAME AS THE IRRESISTIBLE PROJECTILES OF OUR WARRIORS MOWED THROUGH THEM THE FIRE FROM THE VESSELS WAS MOST INEFFECTUAL OWING AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED
303-123506-0010 TO THE UNEXPECTED SUDDENNESS OF THE FIRST VOLLEY WHICH CAUGHT THE SHIP'S CREWS ENTIRELY UNPREPARED AND THE SIGHTING APPARATUS OF THE GUNS UNPROTECTED FROM THE DEADLY AIM OF OUR WARRIORS
303-123506-0011 FOR EXAMPLE A PROPORTION OF THEM ALWAYS THE BEST MARKSMEN DIRECT THEIR FIRE ENTIRELY UPON THE WIRELESS FINDING AND SIGHTING APPARATUS OF THE BIG GUNS OF AN ATTACKING NAVAL FORCE ANOTHER DETAIL ATTENDS TO THE SMALLER GUNS IN THE SAME WAY
303-123506-0012 UPON THE UPPER WORKS AND UPON THE STEERING GEAR AND PROPELLERS TWENTY MINUTES AFTER THE FIRST VOLLEY THE GREAT FLEET SWUNG TRAILING OFF IN THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH IT HAD FIRST APPEARED SEVERAL OF THE CRAFT WERE LIMPING PERCEPTIBLY
303-123506-0013 AND SEEMED BUT BARELY UNDER THE CONTROL OF THEIR DEPLETED CREWS THEIR FIRE HAD CEASED ENTIRELY AND ALL THEIR ENERGIES SEEMED FOCUSED UPON ESCAPE OUR WARRIORS THEN RUSHED UP TO THE ROOFS OF THE BUILDINGS WHICH WE OCCUPIED
303-123506-0014 AND FOLLOWED THE RETREATING ARMADA WITH A CONTINUOUS FUSILLADE OF DEADLY FIRE ONE BY ONE HOWEVER THE SHIPS MANAGED TO DIP BELOW THE CRESTS OF THE OUTLYING HILLS UNTIL ONLY ONE BARELY MOVING CRAFT WAS IN SIGHT
303-123506-0015 THIS HAD RECEIVED THE BRUNT OF OUR FIRE AND SEEMED TO BE ENTIRELY UNMANNED AS NOT A MOVING FIGURE WAS VISIBLE UPON HER DECKS SLOWLY SHE SWUNG FROM HER COURSE
303-123506-0016 INSTANTLY THE WARRIORS CEASED FIRING
303-123506-0017 AND FAR FROM BEING IN A POSITION TO INFLICT HARM UPON US SHE COULD NOT EVEN CONTROL HERSELF SUFFICIENTLY TO ESCAPE AS SHE NEARED THE CITY THE WARRIORS RUSHED OUT UPON THE PLAIN TO MEET HER
303-123506-0018 BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE STILL WAS TOO HIGH FOR THEM TO HOPE TO REACH HER DECKS FROM MY VANTAGE POINT IN THE WINDOW I COULD SEE THE BODIES OF HER CREW STREWN ABOUT ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHAT MANNER OF CREATURES THEY MIGHT BE
303-123506-0019 NOT A SIGN OF LIFE WAS MANIFEST UPON HER AS SHE DRIFTED SLOWLY WITH THE LIGHT BREEZE IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION SHE WAS DRIFTING SOME FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE GROUND
303-123506-0020 OR OF REINFORCEMENTS IT SOON BECAME EVIDENT THAT SHE WOULD STRIKE THE FACE OF THE BUILDINGS ABOUT A MILE SOUTH OF OUR POSITION AND AS I WATCHED THE PROGRESS OF THE CHASE I SAW A NUMBER OF WARRIORS GALLOP AHEAD DISMOUNT AND ENTER THE BUILDING SHE SEEMED DESTINED TO TOUCH
303-123506-0021 AS THE CRAFT NEARED THE BUILDING AND JUST BEFORE SHE STRUCK THE MARTIAN WARRIORS SWARMED UPON HER FROM THE WINDOWS AND WITH THEIR GREAT SPEARS EASED THE SHOCK OF THE COLLISION
303-123506-0022 AND IN A FEW MOMENTS THEY HAD THROWN OUT GRAPPLING HOOKS AND THE BIG BOAT WAS BEING HAULED TO GROUND BY THEIR FELLOWS BELOW AFTER MAKING HER FAST THEY SWARMED THE SIDES AND SEARCHED THE VESSEL FROM STEM TO STERN
303-123506-0023 I COULD SEE THEM EXAMINING THE DEAD SAILORS EVIDENTLY FOR SIGNS OF LIFE AND PRESENTLY A PARTY OF THEM APPEARED FROM BELOW DRAGGING A LITTLE FIGURE AMONG THEM THE CREATURE WAS CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN HALF AS TALL AS THE GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS
303-123506-0024 AND FROM MY BALCONY I COULD SEE THAT IT WALKED ERECT UPON TWO LEGS AND SURMISED THAT IT WAS SOME NEW AND STRANGE MARTIAN MONSTROSITY WITH WHICH I HAD NOT AS YET BECOME ACQUAINTED THEY REMOVED THEIR PRISONER TO THE GROUND
303-123506-0025 AND THEN COMMENCED A SYSTEMATIC RIFLING OF THE VESSEL THIS OPERATION REQUIRED SEVERAL HOURS DURING WHICH TIME A NUMBER OF THE CHARIOTS WERE REQUISITIONED TO TRANSPORT THE LOOT WHICH CONSISTED IN ARMS AMMUNITION SILKS FURS JEWELS STRANGELY CARVED STONE VESSELS
303-123506-0026 AND A QUANTITY OF SOLID FOODS AND LIQUIDS INCLUDING MANY CASKS OF WATER THE FIRST I HAD SEEN SINCE MY ADVENT UPON MARS
303-123506-0027 AFTER THE LAST LOAD HAD BEEN REMOVED THE WARRIORS MADE LINES FAST TO THE CRAFT AND TOWED HER FAR OUT INTO THE VALLEY IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION A FEW OF THEM THEN BOARDED HER AND WERE BUSILY ENGAGED IN WHAT APPEARED FROM MY DISTANT POSITION
303-123506-0028 AS THE EMPTYING OF THE CONTENTS OF VARIOUS CARBOYS UPON THE DEAD BODIES OF THE SAILORS AND OVER THE DECKS AND WORKS OF THE VESSEL THIS OPERATION CONCLUDED THEY HASTILY CLAMBERED OVER HER SIDES SLIDING DOWN THE GUY ROPES TO THE GROUND
303-123506-0029 THE LAST WARRIOR TO LEAVE THE DECK TURNED AND THREW SOMETHING BACK UPON THE VESSEL WAITING AN INSTANT TO NOTE THE OUTCOME OF HIS ACT AS A FAINT SPURT OF FLAME ROSE FROM THE POINT WHERE THE MISSILE STRUCK HE SWUNG OVER THE SIDE AND WAS QUICKLY UPON THE GROUND
303-123506-0030 AND THE GREAT WARSHIP LIGHTENED BY THE REMOVAL OF THE LOOT SOARED MAJESTICALLY INTO THE AIR HER DECKS AND UPPER WORKS A MASS OF ROARING FLAMES SLOWLY SHE DRIFTED TO THE SOUTHEAST RISING HIGHER AND HIGHER AS THE FLAMES ATE AWAY HER WOODEN PARTS
303-123506-0031 AND DIMINISHED THE WEIGHT UPON HER ASCENDING TO THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING I WATCHED HER FOR HOURS UNTIL FINALLY SHE WAS LOST IN THE DIM VISTAS OF THE DISTANCE THE SIGHT WAS AWE INSPIRING IN THE EXTREME AS ONE CONTEMPLATED THIS MIGHTY FLOATING FUNERAL PYRE
303-123506-0032 DRIFTING UNGUIDED AND UNMANNED THROUGH THE LONELY WASTES OF THE MARTIAN HEAVENS A DERELICT OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION TYPIFYING THE LIFE STORY OF THESE STRANGE AND FEROCIOUS CREATURES INTO WHOSE UNFRIENDLY HANDS FATE HAD CARRIED IT
303-123506-0033 MUCH DEPRESSED AND TO ME UNACCOUNTABLY SO I SLOWLY DESCENDED TO THE STREET THE SCENE I HAD WITNESSED SEEMED TO MARK THE DEFEAT AND ANNIHILATION OF THE FORCES OF A KINDRED PEOPLE
303-123506-0034 RATHER THAN THE ROUTING BY OUR GREEN WARRIORS OF A HORDE OF SIMILAR THOUGH UNFRIENDLY CREATURES I COULD NOT FATHOM THE SEEMING HALLUCINATION NOR COULD I FREE MYSELF FROM IT BUT SOMEWHERE IN THE INNERMOST RECESSES OF MY SOUL I FELT A STRANGE YEARNING TOWARD THESE UNKNOWN FOEMEN
303-123506-0035 AND A MIGHTY HOPE SURGED THROUGH ME THAT THE FLEET WOULD RETURN AND DEMAND A RECKONING FROM THE GREEN WARRIORS WHO HAD SO RUTHLESSLY AND WANTONLY ATTACKED IT CLOSE AT MY HEEL IN HIS NOW ACCUSTOMED PLACE FOLLOWED WOOLA THE HOUND
303-123506-0036 AND AS I EMERGED UPON THE STREET SOLA RUSHED UP TO ME AS THOUGH I HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF SOME SEARCH ON HER PART THE CAVALCADE WAS RETURNING TO THE PLAZA THE HOMEWARD MARCH HAVING BEEN GIVEN UP FOR THAT DAY NOR IN FACT WAS IT RECOMMENCED FOR MORE THAN A WEEK
303-123506-0037 OWING TO THE FEAR OF A RETURN ATTACK BY THE AIR CRAFT LORQUAS PTOMEL WAS TOO ASTUTE AN OLD WARRIOR TO BE CAUGHT UPON THE OPEN PLAINS WITH A CARAVAN OF CHARIOTS AND CHILDREN AND SO WE REMAINED AT THE DESERTED CITY UNTIL THE DANGER SEEMED PASSED
303-123506-0038 AS SOLA AND I ENTERED THE PLAZA A SIGHT MET MY EYES WHICH FILLED MY WHOLE BEING WITH A GREAT SURGE OF MINGLED HOPE FEAR EXULTATION AND DEPRESSION AND YET MOST DOMINANT WAS A SUBTLE SENSE OF RELIEF AND HAPPINESS
303-123506-0039 AND THE SIGHT WHICH MET MY EYES WAS THAT OF A SLENDER GIRLISH FIGURE SIMILAR IN EVERY DETAIL TO THE EARTHLY WOMEN OF MY PAST LIFE SHE DID NOT SEE ME AT FIRST BUT JUST AS SHE WAS DISAPPEARING THROUGH THE PORTAL OF THE BUILDING WHICH WAS TO BE HER PRISON SHE TURNED
303-123506-0040 AND HER EYES MET MINE HER FACE WAS OVAL AND BEAUTIFUL IN THE EXTREME HER EVERY FEATURE WAS FINELY CHISELED AND EXQUISITE HER EYES LARGE AND LUSTROUS AND HER HEAD SURMOUNTED BY A MASS OF COAL BLACK WAVING HAIR
303-123506-0041 HER SKIN WAS OF A LIGHT REDDISH COPPER COLOR AGAINST WHICH THE CRIMSON GLOW OF HER CHEEKS AND THE RUBY OF HER BEAUTIFULLY MOLDED LIPS SHONE WITH A STRANGELY ENHANCING EFFECT SHE WAS AS DESTITUTE OF CLOTHES AS THE GREEN MARTIANS WHO ACCOMPANIED HER
303-123506-0042 INDEED SAVE FOR HER HIGHLY WROUGHT ORNAMENTS SHE WAS ENTIRELY NAKED NOR COULD ANY APPAREL HAVE ENHANCED THE BEAUTY OF HER PERFECT AND SYMMETRICAL FIGURE AS HER GAZE RESTED ON ME HER EYES OPENED WIDE IN ASTONISHMENT AND SHE MADE A LITTLE SIGN WITH HER FREE HAND
303-123506-0043 A SIGN WHICH I DID NOT OF COURSE UNDERSTAND JUST A MOMENT WE GAZED UPON EACH OTHER AND THEN THE LOOK OF HOPE AND RENEWED COURAGE WHICH HAD GLORIFIED HER FACE AS SHE DISCOVERED ME FADED INTO ONE OF UTTER DEJECTION MINGLED WITH LOATHING AND CONTEMPT
303-123506-0044 I REALIZED I HAD NOT ANSWERED HER SIGNAL AND IGNORANT AS I WAS OF MARTIAN CUSTOMS I INTUITIVELY FELT THAT SHE HAD MADE AN APPEAL FOR SUCCOR AND PROTECTION WHICH MY UNFORTUNATE IGNORANCE HAD PREVENTED ME FROM ANSWERING
