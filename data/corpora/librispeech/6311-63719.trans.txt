6311-63719-0006 I HAVE OFTEN HEARD YOU SPOKEN OF AND I HAVE READ OF MORE THAN ONE OF YOUR CASES SO WHEN I GOT IN THIS WELL I MAY AS WELL CALL IT TROUBLE I AT ONCE THOUGHT OF YOU I AM FORTUNATE I BELIEVE IN SEEING COLONEL ASHLEY HIMSELF WHO I UNDERSTOOD HAD RETIRED OR
6311-63719-0007 I CAME HERE PREPARED TO PAY ANY REASONABLE AMOUNT AND THE MERCHANT DREW OUT HIS WALLET THE COLONEL HELD UP A PROTESTING HAND PLEASE DON'T NOT YET HE SAID I CAN NOT ACCEPT A RETAINING FEE UNTIL I HAVE HEARD MORE OF YOUR CASE

6311-63719-0009 THE FRANKER YOU ARE THE FEWER QUESTIONS I SHALL HAVE TO ASK GO ON WELL THEN I WANT TO FIND A CERTAIN VALUABLE DIAMOND CROSS A DIAMOND CROSS YES I DON'T KNOW JUST WHAT IT IS WORTH BUT I BELIEVE A SMALL FORTUNE
6311-63719-0010 AND WAS IT STOLEN FROM YOU NO THOUGH I DO OWN A STORE WHERE JEWELRY IS SOLD WE DON'T CARRY AN EXPENSIVE LINE THIS CROSS BELONGED TO A FRIEND OF MINE
6311-63719-0011 NOTHING VERY COMPLICATED OR TROUBLESOME IN THAT I SUPPOSE THE CROSS WAS STOLEN FROM YOU WHILE IT WAS TEMPORARILY IN YOUR POSSESSION AND YOU DON'T LIKE TO LET YOUR FRIEND KNOW FOR FEAR SHE MAY SUSPECT YOU SUCH THINGS HAVE HAPPENED
6311-63719-0012 DID YOU EVER READ DE MAUPASSANT'S DIAMOND NECKLACE I NEVER DID I'D ADVISE YOU TO ALSO WALTON

6311-63719-0014 THERE WAS A WORLD OF MEANING IN THAT EXCLAMATION AARON GRAFTON TURNED A DEEP RED AND BIT HIS LIPS
6311-63719-0015 WE DETECTIVES ARE USED TO ALL SORTS OF COMPLICATIONS AND MORE THAN ONCE THEY HAVE TO DO WITH WOMEN OFTEN ENOUGH THERE IS NOTHING MORE SERIOUS THAN A LITTLE INDISCRETION BUT I CAN SEE WHERE OUTSIDERS MIGHT MAKE TROUBLE PARTICULARLY HUSBANDS
6311-63719-0016 I TAKE IT THEN THAT YOU AND THE LADY WERE OUT TOGETHER WITHOUT HER HUSBAND KNOWING IT I HOPE HE DOESN'T KNOW OF IT FOR THOUGH ON MY HONOR THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG IN OUR BEING TOGETHER IT MIGHT BE HARD TO MAKE HIM BELIEVE THAT
6311-63719-0017 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU PARTICULARLY IF HE WERE JEALOUS AS MANY HUSBANDS ARE SO YOU WANT ME TO TRY TO GET THIS DIAMOND CROSS BELONGING TO THE MARRIED LADY BACK FOR YOU WITHOUT HER HUSBAND KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT IT THAT'S IT

6311-63719-0020 THE DIAMOND CROSS WHICH IS WORTH I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY THOUSAND DOLLARS BELONGS TO MISSUS CYNTHIA LARCH THE WIFE OF LANGFORD LARCH WHO KEEPS A LARGE HOTEL IN COLCHESTER I KNOW THE PLACE GO ON
6311-63719-0021 AS HIS CALLER LOOKED A BIT SURPRISED OH I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WELL THIS WAS MISSUS LARCH'S CROSS IT IS A FAMILY HEIRLOOM I BELIEVE THOUGH MANY SUPPOSE HER HUSBAND GAVE IT TO HER FOR A WEDDING PRESENT
6311-63719-0022 YOU CALL HER CYNTHIA I HAVE KNOWN HER SINCE WE WERE BOTH CHILDREN I SEE PRAY GO ON IN FACT WE WERE SWEETHEARTS CONTINUED GRAFTON AND WERE ENGAGED BUT THE MATCH WAS BROKEN OFF BY HER FATHER
6311-63719-0023 NOR DID SHE I FANCY THOUGH SHE WAS WILLING TO TAKE ME AS I WAS BUT HER FOLKS MADE TROUBLE THEY BROUGHT SUCH PRESSURE TO BEAR ON HER THAT SHE GAVE IN AND MARRIED LARCH WHO WAS AND IS WEALTHY BUT WHOSE SOCIAL POSITION WAS BENEATH HERS
6311-63719-0024 DON'T THINK I AM TELLING YOU THIS OUT OF MERE JEALOUSY AARON GRAFTON WENT ON AND HIS MANNER WAS EARNEST I LOVED HER DEEPLY AND SINCERELY I DO YET BUT
6311-63719-0025 I WENT AWAY AFTER SHE THREW ME OVER HE RESUMED
6311-63719-0026 GOING OUT WITH HIM BUT I CAME BACK THOUGH THE OLD WOUND STILL HURT I TRIED NOT TO LET HER SEE WE BECAME FRIENDS AGAIN
6311-63719-0027 PERHAPS I HAVE ACTED FOOLISHLY BUT OF LATE I HAVE SEEN HER QUITE OFTEN I BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HER MARRIED LIFE WAS NOT HAPPY I TOOK PAINS TO ENQUIRE AND LEARNED THAT IT WAS NOT
6311-63719-0028 I TRIED TO MAKE HER A LITTLE HAPPIER BY TALKING TO HER ONCE OR TWICE SHE MET ME AND WE WALKED TOGETHER IN THE WOODS THE COLONEL LOOKED SHARPLY AT HIS CALLER OH FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T PUT ANY WRONG CONSTRUCTION ON IT
6311-63719-0029 I'D GIVE MY VERY LIFE TO MAKE HER HAPPY AND DO YOU THINK I'D I DON'T DOUBT YOU FOR A MOMENT SIR THANK YOU SAID MISTER GRAFTON
6311-63719-0030 HE PAUSED A MOMENT TO OVERCOME HIS EMOTION AND RESUMED
6311-63719-0031 IT WAS TO TALK OVER WHAT COURSE WAS BEST FOR HER TO PURSUE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHE AND I WALKED OUT TOGETHER WE WENT IN SECRET FOR THERE ARE GOSSIPING AND WAGGING TONGUES IN COLCHESTER AS ELSEWHERE AND IF I
6311-63719-0032 THE LEADING MERCHANT IN THE TOWN WAS SEEN TO BE ALONE WITH PRETTY CYNTHIA LARCH WHOSE HUSBAND WAS A FRIEND OF JUDGES AND POLITICIANS WHO FREQUENT HIS HOTEL THERE WOULD BE TALK LITTLE SHORT OF SCANDAL I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU SO YOU WALKED IN SECRET YES
6311-63719-0033 AND IT WAS WHILE WE WERE OUT TOGETHER THAT THE CROSS SHE WAS WEARING BECAME UNFASTENED AND FELL I MOST CLUMSILY STEPPED ON IT GREATLY MARRING THE SETTING SHE WAS DISTRESSED OF COURSE BUT I SAID I WOULD TAKE IT TO A JEWELER'S AND HAVE IT REPAIRED WITHOUT ANY ONE BEING THE WISER
6311-63719-0034 SHE AGREED THAT WAS BEST SO I TOOK IT TO MISSUS DARCY'S PLACE AND SHE WAS FOUND MURDERED BROKE IN THE OLD DETECTIVE QUICKLY AARON GRAFTON STARTED FROM HIS CHAIR HOW IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN DID YOU KNOW THAT HE CRIED
6311-63719-0035 I THOUGHT THAT NOT A SOUL BUT I KNEW IT I DID NOT EVEN TELL CYNTHIA THE EXPLANATION IS SIMPLE SAID THE COLONEL I WILL BE ALMOST AS FRANK WITH YOU AS YOU HAVE BEEN WITH ME I KNOW MORE ABOUT YOU THAN YOU THINK WAIT A MOMENT
6311-63719-0036 THE COLONEL STEPPED INTO A CLOSET HE MADE A FEW RAPID CHANGES IN HIS CLOTHING AND TOOK OFF A TINY BIT OF EYEBROW WHICH HAD BEEN ADDED TO HIS OWN A SHORT TIME BEFORE
6311-63719-0037 THEN HE CONFRONTED THE MERCHANT THE MAN I SAW IN THE JEWELRY STORE GASPED GRAFTON I REMEMBER NOW SEEING YOU THERE THE DAY I WENT TO LOOK FOR THE DIAMOND CROSS AND DIDN'T FIND IT SAID THE DETECTIVE
6311-63719-0038 I WONDERED WHAT SO PERTURBED YOU BUT NOW I KNOW AT FIRST I DID THINK YOU MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING OF THE MURDER GOD FORBID SAID THE MERCHANT EARNESTLY AND REVERENTLY AMEN ECHOED THE COLONEL
6311-63719-0039 THAT IS WHY I REVEALED MYSELF TO YOU BUT YOU MUST KEEP MY SECRET IF I AM TO HELP YOU I AM KNOWN IN COLCHESTER AS COLONEL BRENTNALL HAVING REGISTERED AT THE HOTEL UNDER THAT NAME I WILL KEEP THAT NAME FOR THE PRESENT
6311-63719-0040 I FOLLOWED YOU HERE IN FACT I ONLY ENTERED THIS OFFICE A MINUTE OR TWO AHEAD OF YOU SO IT WAS TO FIND THE DIAMOND CROSS YOU VISITED THE STORE OF THE MURDERED WOMAN YES
6311-63719-0041 I TOOK THE CROSS TO HER THE NIGHT BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED AND SHE PROMISED TO HAVE HER COUSIN FIX IT WITHOUT TELLING HIM WHOSE IT WAS AND GET IT BACK TO ME SECRETLY IN A DAY OR SO I THOUGHT CYNTHIA COULD
6311-63719-0042 THEN WEAR IT AGAIN WITHOUT HER HUSBAND KNOWING IT HAD EVER BEEN OUT OF HER POSSESSION BUT THE MURDER CHANGED ALL MY PLANS
6311-63719-0043 REALLY I WAS SO DISTRESSED I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK I DID NOT WANT TO TELL ANY ONE WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR SO I WENT ABOUT QUIETLY BUT I COULD NOT FIND IT THEN I WAS OBLIGED TO ASK DARCY ABOUT IT SECRETLY OF COURSE AND WITHOUT HINTING AS TO THE OWNERSHIP
6311-63719-0044 HE SAID MISSUS DARCY HAD NOT GIVEN IT TO HIM NOR ASKED HIM TO REPAIR IT NOR WAS IT IN THE SHOP AS FAR AS HE KNEW
6311-63719-0045 AND THERE WAS NONE NONE UNLESS YOU CALL THE TAKING OF THE DIAMOND CROSS A THEFT FOR THAT ALONE IS MISSING AND I'D GIVE HALF MY FORTUNE TO GET IT BACK
6311-63719-0046 CYNTHIA'S HUSBAND MAY ASK ABOUT IT AT ANY MOMENT AND WHAT EXCUSE CAN SHE GIVE
6311-63719-0047 AGREED THE DETECTIVE WELL I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO FIRST I THOUGHT YOU WANTED ME TO WORK ON THE MURDER CASE BUT AS I AM ALREADY ENGAGED ON THAT TO TRY TO CLEAR DARCY I CAN AS WELL INCLUDE THE DIAMOND CROSS MYSTERY ALSO
6311-63719-0048 I WONDER IF THEY HAVE ANY CONNECTION I DON'T SEE HOW THEY CAN HAVE MISSUS DARCY MAY MERELY HAVE PUT THE CROSS AWAY SECRETLY AND IT MAY TAKE A CAREFUL SEARCH OF THE PLACE TO FIND IT MAYBE SO I'LL HAVE TO NOSE AROUND A BIT THERE CAME A KNOCK ON THE OFFICE DOOR COME
6311-63719-0049 CALLED OUT THE COLONEL HIS CLERK HANDED HIM A TELEGRAM TEARING IT OPEN THE DETECTIVE READ A MESSAGE FROM ONE OF HIS AGENTS IN A DISTANT WESTERN CITY IT SAID SPOTTY MORGAN ARRESTED HERE TO DAY
6311-63719-0050 AND HE HURRIED TO A PRIVATE BOOTH IN A BACK OFFICE LEAVING GRAFTON TO HIMSELF AFTER HE HAD TELEPHONED COLONEL ASHLEY SAT IN SILENCE IN THE BOOTH MUSING NOW I WONDER HE SAID TO HIMSELF IF GRAFTON IS TELLING ME THE TRUTH
6311-63719-0051 ALMOST ANY ONE WOULD BELIEVE HIS STORY IT SOUNDS STRAIGHT ENOUGH AND YET I CAN'T TAKE ANY CHANCES I GUESS I MUSTN'T LOSE SIGHT OF YOU AARON GRAFTON
6311-63719-0052 AND PERHAPS LARCH ISN'T SO BAD A CHAP AS YOU'D HAVE ME BELIEVE TRUST A DISGRUNTLED LOVER FOR SAYING THE WORST ABOUT THE OTHER CHAP YES I CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE ANY CHANCES
