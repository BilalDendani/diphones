101-126861-0000 THIS COAST IS THE SEASHORE OF THE GREAT DESERT IT IS A WILD LONELY PLACE ALL SAND AND STONES AND IT WAS HERE THAT THE BARBARY PIRATES LIVED THESE PIRATES A BAD LOT OF MEN
101-126861-0001 USED TO WAIT FOR SAILORS TO BE SHIPWRECKED ON THEIR SHORES AND OFTEN IF THEY SAW A BOAT PASSING THEY WOULD COME OUT IN THEIR FAST SAILING SHIPS AND CHASE IT WHEN THEY CAUGHT A BOAT
101-126861-0002 LIKE THIS AT SEA THEY WOULD STEAL EVERYTHING ON IT AND AFTER THEY HAD TAKEN THE PEOPLE OFF THEY WOULD SINK THE SHIP AND SAIL BACK TO BARBARY SINGING SONGS AND FEELING PROUD OF THE MISCHIEF THEY HAD DONE
101-126861-0003 THEN THEY USED TO MAKE THE PEOPLE THEY HAD CAUGHT WRITE HOME TO THEIR FRIENDS FOR MONEY AND IF THE FRIENDS SENT NO MONEY THE PIRATES OFTEN THREW THE PEOPLE INTO THE SEA
101-126861-0004 NOW ONE SUNSHINY DAY THE DOCTOR AND DAB DAB WERE WALKING UP AND DOWN ON THE SHIP FOR EXERCISE A NICE FRESH WIND WAS BLOWING THE BOAT ALONG AND EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY
101-126861-0005 I HAVE A FEELING IT ISN'T A FRIENDLY SHIP I AM AFRAID THERE IS MORE TROUBLE COMING TO US JIP WHO WAS LYING NEAR TAKING A NAP IN THE SUN BEGAN TO GROWL AND TALK IN HIS SLEEP
101-126861-0006 I SUPPOSE HE IS SAID DAB DAB ALL DOGS CAN SMELL IN THEIR SLEEP BUT WHAT IS HE SMELLING ASKED THE DOCTOR THERE IS NO ROAST BEEF COOKING ON OUR SHIP NO
101-126861-0007 SAID DAB DAB THE ROAST BEEF MUST BE ON THAT OTHER SHIP OVER THERE BUT THAT'S TEN MILES AWAY SAID THE DOCTOR HE COULDN'T SMELL THAT FAR SURELY OH YES HE COULD SAID DAB DAB
101-126861-0008 YOU ASK HIM THEN JIP STILL FAST ASLEEP BEGAN TO GROWL AGAIN AND HIS LIP CURLED UP ANGRILY SHOWING HIS CLEAN WHITE TEETH I SMELL BAD MEN
101-126861-0009 HE GROWLED THE WORST MEN I EVER SMELT I SMELL TROUBLE I SMELL A FIGHT SIX BAD SCOUNDRELS FIGHTING AGAINST ONE BRAVE MAN I WANT TO HELP HIM
101-126861-0010 WOOF OO WOOF THEN HE BARKED LOUD AND WOKE HIMSELF UP WITH A SURPRISED LOOK ON HIS FACE SEE CRIED DAB DAB THAT BOAT IS NEARER NOW
101-126861-0011 YOU CAN COUNT ITS THREE BIG SAILS ALL RED WHOEVER IT IS THEY ARE COMING AFTER US I WONDER WHO THEY ARE THEY ARE BAD SAILORS SAID JIP AND THEIR SHIP IS VERY SWIFT
101-126861-0012 AND FETCH ME ALL THE SAILS YOU SEE THE DOG HURRIED DOWNSTAIRS AND DRAGGED UP EVERY SAIL HE COULD FIND BUT EVEN WHEN ALL THESE WERE PUT UP ON THE MASTS TO CATCH THE WIND
101-126861-0013 THE BOAT DID NOT GO NEARLY AS FAST AS THE PIRATES' WHICH KEPT COMING ON BEHIND CLOSER AND CLOSER THIS IS A POOR SHIP THE PRINCE GAVE US SAID GUB GUB THE PIG
101-126861-0014 THE SLOWEST HE COULD FIND I SHOULD THINK MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO WIN A RACE IN A SOUP TUREEN AS HOPE TO GET AWAY FROM THEM
101-126861-0015 IN A SWIFT SHIP AND WHAT SHOULD HE DO ABOUT IT WHEN THE SWALLOWS HEARD THIS THEY ALL CAME DOWN ON TO THE DOCTOR'S SHIP AND THEY TOLD HIM TO UNRAVEL SOME PIECES OF LONG ROPE
101-126861-0016 AND MAKE THEM INTO A LOT OF THIN STRINGS AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD THEN THE ENDS OF THESE STRINGS WERE TIED ON TO THE FRONT OF THE SHIP AND THE SWALLOWS TOOK HOLD OF THE STRINGS WITH THEIR FEET
101-126861-0017 AND FLEW OFF PULLING THE BOAT ALONG AND ALTHOUGH SWALLOWS ARE NOT VERY STRONG WHEN ONLY ONE OR TWO ARE BY THEMSELVES IT IS DIFFERENT WHEN THERE ARE A GREAT LOT OF THEM TOGETHER
101-126861-0018 AND THERE TIED TO THE DOCTOR'S SHIP WERE A THOUSAND STRINGS AND TWO THOUSAND SWALLOWS WERE PULLING ON EACH STRING ALL TERRIBLY SWIFT FLIERS
101-126861-0019 AND IN A MOMENT THE DOCTOR FOUND HIMSELF TRAVELING SO FAST HE HAD TO HOLD HIS HAT ON WITH BOTH HANDS FOR HE FELT AS THOUGH THE SHIP ITSELF
101-126861-0020 AND ALL THE ANIMALS ON THE SHIP BEGAN TO LAUGH AND DANCE ABOUT IN THE RUSHING AIR FOR WHEN THEY LOOKED BACK AT THE PIRATES SHIP THEY COULD SEE THAT IT WAS GROWING SMALLER NOW INSTEAD OF BIGGER
