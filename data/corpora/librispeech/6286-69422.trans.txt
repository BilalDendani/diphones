6286-69422-0000 WAS HER OWN UNEASINESS INFECTIOUS WAS THE CHILD DETERMINED TO SHARE HER VIGIL SHE WOULD WAIT A LITTLE LONGER THIS TIME AND SEE THEIR ROOMS WERE OVER THE PARLOUR AND THUS AS FAR REMOVED AS POSSIBLE FROM THE JUDGE'S DEN
6286-69422-0001 IN HER OWN WHICH WAS FRONT SHE FELT AT PERFECT EASE
6286-69422-0002 THAT SHE FINALLY RAISED HER WINDOW AND ALLOWED THE COOL WIND TO SOOTHE HER HEATED CHEEKS HOW CALM THE ASPECT OF THE LAWN AND ITS CLUSTERING SHRUBS
6286-69422-0003 DIMLY SEEN THOUGH THEY WERE THROUGH THE LEAVES OF THE VINES SHE HAD BUT PARTIALLY CLIPPED SHE FELT THE ELEMENT OF PEACE WHICH COMES WITH PERFECT QUIET AND WAS FAIN TO FORGET FOR AWHILE THE TERRORS IT SO FREQUENTLY CONCEALS
6286-69422-0004 THE MOON WHICH HAD BEEN INVISIBLE UP TO THIS MOMENT EMERGED FROM SKURRYING CLOUDS AS SHE QUIETLY WATCHED THE SCENE AND IN AN INSTANT HER PEACE WAS GONE AND ALL THE THRONGING DIFFICULTIES OF HER POSITION CAME RUSHING BACK UPON HER
6286-69422-0005 IN FULL FORCE AS ALL THE DETAILS OF THE SCENE SO MERCIFULLY HIDDEN JUST NOW FLASHED AGAIN UPON HER VISION PERCHED AS SHE WAS IN A WINDOW OVERLOOKING THE LANE SHE HAD BUT TO LIFT HER EYES FROM THE DOUBLE FENCE
6286-69422-0006 THAT SYMBOL OF SAD SECLUSION TO LIGHT ON THE TREES RISING ABOVE THAT UNSPEAKABLE RAVINE BLACK WITH MEMORIES SHE FELT STRANGELY LIKE FORGETTING TO NIGHT BEYOND HOW IT STOOD OUT ON THE BLUFF
6286-69422-0007 THE BIFURCATED MASS OF DISMAL RUIN FROM WHICH MEN HAD TURNED THEIR EYES THESE MANY YEARS NOW BUT THE MOON LOVED IT CARESSED IT DALLIED WITH IT
6286-69422-0008 LIGHTING UP ITS TOPPLING CHIMNEY AND EMPTY STARING GABLE THERE WHERE THE BLACK STREAK COULD BE SEEN SHE HAD STOOD WITH THE JUDGE IN THAT STRUGGLE OF WILLS WHICH HAD LEFT ITS SCARS UPON THEM BOTH TO THIS VERY DAY
6286-69422-0009 THERE HIDDEN BUT ALWAYS SEEN BY THOSE WHO REMEMBERED THE TRADITIONS OF THE PLACE MOULDERED AWAY THE WALLS OF THAT OLD CLOSET WHERE THE TIMOROUS GOD STRICKEN SUICIDE HAD BREATHED OUT HIS SOUL
6286-69422-0010 SHE HAD STOOD IN IT ONLY THE OTHER DAY PENNED FROM OUTSIDERS VIEW BY THE JUDGE'S OUTSTRETCHED ARMS THEN SHE HAD NO MIND FOR BYGONE HORRORS HER OWN TRAGEDY WEIGHED TOO HEAVILY UPON HER BUT TO NIGHT
6286-69422-0011 AS SHE GAZED FASCINATED ANXIOUS TO FORGET HERSELF ANXIOUS TO INDULGE IN ANY THOUGHT WHICH WOULD RELIEVE HER FROM DWELLING ON THE QUESTION SHE MUST SETTLE BEFORE SHE SLEPT SHE ALLOWED HER WONDER AND HER REVULSION TO HAVE FREE COURSE
6286-69422-0012 INSTEAD OF IGNORING SHE WOULD RECALL THE STORY OF THE PLACE AS IT HAD BEEN TOLD HER WHEN SHE FIRST CAME TO SETTLE IN ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD SPENCER'S FOLLY WELL IT HAD BEEN THAT
6286-69422-0013 WHEN THE WIND TORE DOWN BRANCHES AND TOPPLED DOWN CHIMNEYS WHEN CATTLE WERE SMITTEN IN THE FIELD AND MEN ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN THE OLD BRIDGE SINCE REPLACED BUCKLED UP AND SANK IN THE ROARING FLOOD IT COULD NO LONGER SPAN
6286-69422-0014 AND THE BLUFF TOWERING OVERHEAD FLARED INTO FLAME AND THE HOUSE WHICH WAS ITS GLORY WAS SMITTEN APART BY THE DESCENDING BOLT AS BY A TITAN SWORD AND BLAZED LIKE A BEACON TO THE SKY
6286-69422-0015 THIS WAS LONG BEFORE SHE HERSELF HAD COME TO SHELBY BUT SHE HAD BEEN TOLD THE STORY SO OFTEN THAT IT WAS QUITE AS VIVID TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE INNUMERABLE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAD CROWDED THE GLISTENING SWIMMING STREETS
6286-69422-0016 TO VIEW THIS SPECTACLE OF DESTRUCTION THE FAMILY HAD BEEN GONE FOR MONTHS AND SO NO PITY MINGLED WITH THE EXCITEMENT NOT TILL THE FOLLOWING DAY DID THE AWFUL NATURE OF THE EVENT BREAK IN ITS FULL HORROR UPON THE TOWN
6286-69422-0017 AMONG THE RUINS IN A CLOSET WHICH THE FLAMES HAD SPARED THEY FOUND HUNCHED UP IN ONE CORNER THE BODY OF A MAN IN WHOSE SEARED THROAT A WOUND APPEARED WHICH HAD NOT BEEN MADE BY LIGHTNING OR FIRE
6286-69422-0018 SPENCER SPENCER HIMSELF RETURNED THEY KNEW NOT HOW TO DIE OF THIS SELF INFLICTED WOUND IN THE DARK CORNER OF HIS GRAND BUT NEGLECTED DWELLING AND THIS WAS WHAT MADE THE HORROR OF THE PLACE
6286-69422-0019 AND THE SPOT BECAME OUTLAWED TO ALL SENSITIVE CITIZENS FOLLY AND MADNESS AND THE VENGEANCE OF HIGH HEAVEN UPON UNHALLOWED WALLS SPOKE TO HER FROM THAT TOWERING MASS BATHED THOUGH IT WAS JUST NOW
6286-69422-0020 IN LIQUID LIGHT UNDER THE IMPARTIAL MOON BUT AS SHE CONTINUED TO SURVEY IT THE CLOUDS CAME TROOPING UP ONCE MORE AND THE VISION WAS WIPED OUT AND WITH IT ALL MEMORIES SAVE THOSE OF A NEARER TROUBLE
6286-69422-0021 A MORE PRESSING NECESSITY WITHDRAWING FROM THE WINDOW
6286-69422-0022 INNOCENCE WAS ASLEEP AT LAST NOT A MOVEMENT DISTURBED THE CLOSED LIDS ON THE WAX LIKE CHEEK EVEN THE BREATH CAME SO SOFTLY
6286-69422-0023 REPOSE THE MOST PERFECT AND IN THE FORM OF ALL OTHERS THE SWEETEST TO A TENDER MOTHER LAY BEFORE HER AND TOUCHED HER ALREADY YEARNING HEART TO TEARS
6286-69422-0024 YES SHE WAS RIGHT SORROW WAS SLOWLY SAPPING THE FOUNTAIN OF HER DARLING'S YOUTH
6286-69422-0025 WITH A SOB AND A PRAYER THE MOTHER LEFT THE ROOM AND LOCKING HERSELF INTO HER OWN SAT DOWN AT LAST TO FACE THE NEW PERPLEXITY THE MONSTROUS ENIGMA WHICH HAD COME INTO HER LIFE
6286-69422-0026 IT HAD FOLLOWED IN NATURAL SEQUENCE FROM A PROPOSAL MADE BY THE JUDGE THAT SOME ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN HIS LONG NEGLECTED ROOMS HE HAD SAID ON RISING FROM THE BREAKFAST TABLE
6286-69422-0027 I AM REALLY SORRY TO TROUBLE YOU MISSUS SCOVILLE BUT IF YOU HAVE TIME THIS MORNING WILL YOU CLEAN UP MY STUDY BEFORE I LEAVE THE CARRIAGE IS ORDERED FOR HALF PAST NINE
6286-69422-0028 YOU WILL BE CHOKED JUDGE NO MORE THAN I HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS YOU MAY ENTER ANY TIME AND GOING IN HE LEFT THE DOOR OPEN BEHIND HIM HE WILL LOCK IT WHEN HE GOES OUT
6286-69422-0029 SHE COMMENTED TO HERSELF I HAD BETTER HASTEN
6286-69422-0030 A POSSIBLE ENLIGHTENMENT ON A SUBJECT WHICH HAD HELD THE WHOLE COMMUNITY IN A STATE OF CURIOSITY FOR YEARS SHE WAS GOING TO ENTER THE ROOM WHICH HAD BEEN BARRED FROM PUBLIC SIGHT BY POOR BELA'S DYING BODY
6286-69422-0031 SHE WAS GOING TO SEE OR HAD HE ONLY MEANT THAT SHE WAS TO HAVE HER WAY WITH THE LIBRARY THE ROOM WHERE SHE HAD ALREADY BEEN AND MUCH OF WHICH SHE REMEMBERED THE DOUBT GAVE A TREMULOUS EAGERNESS TO HER STEP
6286-69422-0032 AND CAUSED HER EYE TO WANDER IMMEDIATELY TO THAT FORBIDDEN CORNER SOON AS SHE HAD STEPPED OVER THE THRESHOLD THE BEDROOM DOOR WAS OPEN PROOF THAT SHE WAS EXPECTED TO ENTER THERE
6286-69422-0033 MEANWHILE SHE FELT THE EYE OF THE JUDGE UPON HER AND ENDEAVOURED TO PRESERVE A PERFECT COMPOSURE AND TO SINK THE CURIOUS AND INQUIRING WOMAN IN THE DILIGENT HOUSEKEEPER BUT SHE COULD NOT QUITE
6286-69422-0034 TWO FACTS OF WHICH SHE IMMEDIATELY BECAME COGNISANT PREVENTED THIS FIRST THE GREAT ROOM BEFORE HER PRESENTED A BARE FLOOR WHEREAS ON HER FIRST VISIT IT HAD BEEN VERY DECENTLY
6286-69422-0035 IF NOT CHEERFULLY COVERED BY A HUGE CARPET RUG SECONDLY THE JUDGE'S CHAIR WHICH HAD ONCE LOOKED IMMOVABLE HAD BEEN DRAGGED FORWARD INTO SUCH A POSITION THAT HE COULD KEEP HIS OWN EYE ON THE BEDROOM DOOR
6286-69422-0036 MANIFESTLY SHE WAS NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO PURSUE HER DUTIES UNWATCHED CERTAINLY SHE HAD TO TAKE MORE THAN ONE LOOK AT THE EVERY DAY IMPLEMENTS SHE CARRIED TO RETAIN THAT BALANCE OF JUDGMENT
6286-69422-0037 WHICH SHOULD PREVENT HER FROM BECOMING THE DUPE OF HER OWN EXPECTATIONS I DO NOT EXPECT YOU TO CLEAN UP HERE AS THOROUGHLY AS YOU HAVE YOUR OWN ROOMS UP STAIRS HE REMARKED AS SHE PASSED HIM YOU HAVEN'T THE TIME
6286-69422-0038 I HAD RATHER NOT HAVE THAT TOUCHED SHE TURNED WITH A SMILE AND NODDED SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD BEEN SET TO WORK WITH A STRING TIED ROUND HER FEET NOT TOUCH THE CURTAIN
6286-69422-0039 WHY THAT WAS THE ONE THING IN THE ROOM SHE WANTED TO TOUCH FOR IN IT SHE NOT ONLY SAW THE CARPET WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN UP FROM THE FLOOR OF THE STUDY BUT A POSSIBLE SCREEN BEHIND WHICH ANYTHING MIGHT LURK EVEN HIS REDOUBTABLE SECRET
6286-69422-0040 OR HAD IT ANOTHER AND MUCH SIMPLER EXPLANATION MIGHT IT NOT HAVE BEEN HUNG THERE MERELY AS A SHIELD TO THE WINDOW THE ROOM MUST HAVE A WINDOW AND THERE WAS NONE TO BE SEEN ELSEWHERE IT WOULD BE LIKE HIM TO SHUT OUT LIGHT AND AIR
6286-69422-0041 SHE WOULD ASK THERE IS NO WINDOW SHE OBSERVED LOOKING BACK AT THE JUDGE NO WAS HIS SHORT REPLY SLOWLY SHE SET DOWN HER PAIL ONE THING WAS SETTLED
6286-69422-0042 IT WAS BELA'S COT SHE SAW BEFORE HER A COT WITHOUT ANY SHEETS THESE HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN THE DEAD NEGRO'S ROOM AND THE JUDGE HAD BEEN SLEEPING JUST AS SHE HAD FEARED WRAPPED IN A RUG AND WITH UNCOVERED PILLOW
6286-69422-0043 THIS PILLOW WAS HIS OWN IT HAD NOT BEEN BROUGHT DOWN WITH THE BED SHE HASTILY SLIPPED A COVER ON IT AND WITHOUT CALLING ANY FURTHER ATTENTION TO HER ACT BEGAN TO MAKE UP THE BED CONSCIOUS THAT THE PAPERS HE MADE A FEINT OF READING
6286-69422-0044 WERE BUT A COVER FOR HIS WATCHFULNESS SHE MOVED ABOUT IN A MATTER OF FACT WAY AND DID NOT SPARE HIM THE CLOUDS OF DUST WHICH PRESENTLY ROSE BEFORE HER BROOM SHE COULD HAVE MANAGED IT MORE DEFTLY
6286-69422-0045 WOULD HAVE DONE SO AT ANOTHER TIME BUT IT WAS HER EXPRESS INTENTION JUST NOW TO MAKE HIM MOVE BACK OUT OF HER WAY IF ONLY TO GIVE HER AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISTURB BY A BACKWARD STROKE OF HER BROOM THE FOLDS OF THE CARPET RUG
6286-69422-0046 OH SHE PROTESTED WITH A PLEADING GLANCE HIS WAY I'M NOT HALF DONE THERE'S ANOTHER DAY TO FOLLOW HE DRYLY REMARKED RISING AND TAKING A KEY FROM HIS POCKET
6286-69422-0047 THE ACT EXPRESSED HIS WISHES AND SHE WAS PROCEEDING TO CARRY OUT HER THINGS WHEN A QUICK SLIDING NOISE FROM THE WALL SHE WAS PASSING DREW HER ATTENTION AND CAUSED HER TO SPRING FORWARD IN AN INVOLUNTARY EFFORT
6286-69422-0048 TO CATCH A PICTURE WHICH HAD SLIPPED ITS CORD AND WAS FALLING TO THE FLOOR A SHOUT FROM THE JUDGE OF STAND ASIDE LET ME COME REACHED HER TOO LATE SHE HAD GRASPED AND LIFTED THE PICTURE AND SEEN
6286-69422-0049 BUT FIRST LET ME EXPLAIN THIS PICTURE WAS NOT LIKE THE OTHERS HANGING ABOUT IT WAS A VEILED ONE FROM SOME MOTIVE OF PRECAUTION OR CHARACTERISTIC DESIRE FOR CONCEALMENT
6286-69422-0050 ON THE PART OF THE JUDGE IT HAD BEEN CLOSELY WRAPPED ABOUT IN HEAVY BROWN PAPER BEFORE BEING HUNG AND IN THE ENCOUNTER WHICH ENSUED BETWEEN THE FALLING PICTURE AND THE SPEAR OF AN IMAGE STANDING ON A TABLE UNDERNEATH
6286-69422-0051 THIS PAPER HAD RECEIVED A SLIT THROUGH WHICH DEBORAH HAD BEEN GIVEN A GLIMPSE OF THE CANVAS BENEATH THE SHOCK OF WHAT SHE SAW WOULD HAVE UNNERVED A LESS COURAGEOUS WOMAN
6286-69422-0052 IT WAS A HIGHLY FINISHED PORTRAIT OF OLIVER IN HIS YOUTH
