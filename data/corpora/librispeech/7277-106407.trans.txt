7277-106407-0000 THE IMPATIENT STICKS IN THE PIT AND SHRILL CATCALLS IN THE GALLERY HAD BEGUN TO CONTEND WITH THE MUSIC IN THE ORCHESTRA AND THRICE HAD WE SURVEYED THE HOUSE TO RECOGNIZE EVERY BODY WHOM ANY BODY KNEW WHEN THE DOOR OF THE BOX NEXT TO OURS THE ONLY BOX THAT HAD REMAINED EMPTY
7277-106407-0001 WAS THROWN OPEN AND IN POURED AN OVER DRESSED PARTY WHOM NOBODY KNEW LADY DE BRANTEFIELD AFTER ONE RECONNOITRING GLANCE PRONOUNCED THEM TO BE CITY GOTHS AND VANDALS
7277-106407-0002 AND WITHOUT RESTING HER GLASS UPON THEM FOR HALF A MOMENT TURNED IT TO SOME MORE PROFITABLE FIELD OF SPECULATION THERE WAS NO GENTLEMAN OF THIS PARTY BUT A PORTLY MATRON TOWERING ABOVE THE REST SEEMED THE PRINCIPAL MOVER AND ORDERER OF THE GROUP
7277-106407-0003 THE AWKWARD BUSTLE THEY MADE FACING AND BACKING PLACING AND CHANGING OF PLACES AND THE DIFFICULTY THEY FOUND IN SEATING THEMSELVES WERE IN STRIKING CONTRAST WITH THE HIGH BRED EASE OF THE LADIES OF OUR PARTY
7277-106407-0004 LADY ANNE MOWBRAY LOOKED DOWN UPON THEIR OPERATIONS WITH A PRETTY AIR OF QUIET SURPRISE TINCTURED WITH HORROR WHILE MY MOTHER'S SHRINKING DELICACY ENDEAVOURED TO SUGGEST SOME IDEA OF PROPRIETY TO THE CITY MATRON
7277-106407-0005 LEANING ON THE PARTITION WHICH DIVIDED OR OUGHT TO HAVE DIVIDED HER FROM US CONSIDERABLY PASSED THE LINE OF DEMARCATION LADY DE BRANTEFIELD WITH ALL THE PRIDE OF ALL THE DE BRANTEFIELDS SINCE THE NORMAN CONQUEST CONCENTRATED IN HER COUNTENANCE
7277-106407-0006 THREW AN EXCOMMUNICATING WITHERING LOOK UPON THE ARM BUT THE ELBOW FELT IT NOT IT NEVER STIRRED THE LADY SEEMED NOT TO BE MADE OF PENETRABLE STUFF IN HAPPY IGNORANCE SHE SAT FANNING HERSELF FOR A FEW SECONDS
7277-106407-0007 THEN SUDDENLY STARTING AND STRETCHING FORWARD TO THE FRONT ROW WHERE FIVE OF HER YOUNG LADIES WERE WEDGED SHE AIMED WITH HER FAN AT EACH OF THEIR BACKS IN QUICK SUCCESSION
7277-106407-0008 ALL EYES TURNED TO LOOK FOR BERRY
7277-106407-0009 MISS BERRY THAT MUST NOT BE COME FORWARD HERE'S MY PLACE OR QUEENEY'S CRIED MISSUS COATES STRETCHING BACKWARDS WITH HER UTMOST MIGHT TO SEIZE SOME ONE IN THE FARTHEST CORNER OF THE BACK ROW WHO HAD HITHERTO BEEN INVISIBLE
7277-106407-0010 BUT TO OUR SURPRISE WE BEHELD ONE WHO SEEMED OF A DIFFERENT ORDER OF BEINGS FROM THOSE BY WHOM SHE WAS SURROUNDED LORD MOWBRAY AND I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER STRUCK BY THE SAME SENTIMENT PAINED FOR THIS ELEGANT TIMID YOUNG CREATURE AS WE SAW HER
7277-106407-0011 ALL BLUSHING AND RELUCTANT FORCED BY THE IRRESISTIBLE FAT ORDERER OF ALL THINGS TO STEP UP ON THE SEAT TO STEP FORWARD FROM BENCH TO BENCH AND THEN WAIT IN PAINFUL PRE EMINENCE WHILE ISSY AND CECY AND QUEENEY AND MISS COATES SETTLED HOW THEY COULD MAKE ROOM
7277-106407-0012 OR WHICH SHOULD VACATE HER SEAT IN HER FAVOUR IN SPITE OF THE AWKWARDNESS OF HER SITUATION SHE STOOD WITH SUCH QUIET RESIGNED YET DIGNIFIED GRACE THAT RIDICULE COULD NOT TOUCH HER THE MOMENT SHE WAS SEATED WITH HER BACK TO US AND OUT OF HEARING
7277-106407-0013 LADY DE BRANTEFIELD TURNED TO HER SON AND ASKED WHO IS SHE AN EAST INDIAN I SHOULD GUESS BY HER DARK COMPLEXION WHISPERED LADY ANNE TO ME SOME FEATHER OR LAPPET INTERCEPTED MY VIEW OF HER FACE
7277-106407-0014 AND THEY SHOULD GIVE IN ITS STEAD THE MERCHANT OF VENICE THE MERCHANT OF VENICE AND MACKLIN THE JEW MURMURS OF DISCONTENT FROM THE LADIES IN MY BOX WHO REGRETTED THEIR SENTIMENTAL COMEDY AND THEIR SILVER TONED BARRY WERE ALL LOST UPON ME
7277-106407-0015 I REJOICED THAT I SHOULD SEE MACKLIN IN SHYLOCK BEFORE THE PERFORMANCE BEGAN MY ATTENTION WAS AGAIN CAUGHT BY THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE PERSONS IN THE NEXT BOX THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME SUDDEN CAUSE OF DISTRESS AS I GATHERED FROM EXCLAMATIONS OF HOW UNLUCKY HOW DISTRESSING
7277-106407-0016 HE MADE HIS WAY TO A YOUNG LADY AT THE OTHER END OF THE BOX AND I OCCUPYING IMMEDIATELY THE CEDED PLACE STATIONED MYSELF SO THAT I HAD A BETTER VIEW OF MY OBJECT AND COULD OBSERVE HER WITHOUT BEING SEEN BY ANY ONE SHE WAS PERFECTLY STILL
7277-106407-0017 THOUGH FROM AN INDESCRIBABLE EXPRESSION IN THE AIR OF THE BACK OF HER HEAD AND NECK
7277-106407-0018 THE PLAY WENT ON SHYLOCK APPEARED I FORGOT EVERY THING BUT HIM SUCH A COUNTENANCE SUCH AN EXPRESSION OF LATENT MALICE AND REVENGE OF EVERY THING DETESTABLE IN HUMAN NATURE
7277-106407-0019 MUCH AS MY EXPECTATIONS HAD BEEN RAISED IT FAR SURPASSED ANY THING I HAD CONCEIVED I FORGOT IT WAS MACKLIN I THOUGHT ONLY OF SHYLOCK IN MY ENTHUSIASM I STOOD UP I PRESSED FORWARD
7277-106407-0020 I LEANED FAR OVER TOWARDS THE STAGE THAT I MIGHT NOT LOSE A WORD A LOOK A GESTURE WHEN THE ACT FINISHED AS THE CURTAIN FELL AND THE THUNDERS OF APPLAUSE DIED AWAY I HEARD A SOFT LOW SIGH NEAR ME I LOOKED AND SAW THE JEWESS
7277-106407-0021 SHE LOOKED UP WHILE MY EYES WERE FIXED UPON HER A SUDDEN AND DEEP COLOUR SPREAD OVER HER FACE AND MOUNTED TO HER TEMPLES IN MY CONFUSION I DID THE VERY THING I SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE AND SAID THE THING OF ALL OTHERS I SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID
7277-106407-0022 I EXPRESSED A FEAR THAT I HAD BEEN STANDING IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO PREVENT HER FROM SEEING SHYLOCK SHE BOWED MILDLY AND WAS I BELIEVE GOING TO SPEAK YOU HAVE INDEED SIR INTERRUPTED MISSUS COATES STOOD SO THAT NOBODY COULD SEE NOTHING BUT YOURSELF SO SINCE YOU MENTION IT
7277-106407-0023 AND SPEAK WITHOUT AN INTRODUCTION EXCUSE ME IF I SUGGEST AGAINST THE NEXT ACT THAT THIS YOUNG LADY HAS NEVER BEEN AT A PLAY BEFORE IN HER LIFE IN LON'ON AT LEAST
7277-106407-0024 YET SINCE SHE IS HERE TIS BETTER SHE SHOULD SEE SOMETHING THAN NOTHING IF GENTLEMEN WILL GIVE HER LEAVE I BOWED IN SIGN OF SUBMISSION AND REPENTANCE AND WAS RETIRING SO AS TO LEAVE MY PLACE VACANT AND A FULL OPENING TO THE STAGE
7277-106407-0025 BUT IN A SWEET GENTLEWOMANLIKE VOICE SEEMING PERHAPS MORE DELIGHTFUL FROM CONTRAST THE YOUNG LADY SAID THAT SHE HAD SEEN AND COULD SEE QUITE AS MUCH AS SHE WISHED OF THE PLAY AND SHE BEGGED THAT I WOULD NOT QUIT MY PLACE I SHOULD OBLIGE HER SHE ADDED IN A LOWER TONE
7277-106407-0026 IF I WOULD CONTINUE TO STAND AS I HAD DONE I OBEYED AND PLACED MYSELF SO AS TO SCREEN HER FROM OBSERVATION DURING THE WHOLE OF THE NEXT ACT BUT NOW MY PLEASURE IN THE PLAY WAS OVER I COULD NO LONGER ENJOY MACKLIN'S INCOMPARABLE ACTING
7277-106407-0027 AT EVERY STROKE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SKILFUL ACTOR OR OF THE MASTER POET I FELT A STRANGE MIXTURE OF ADMIRATION AND REGRET I ALMOST WISHED THAT SHAKSPEARE HAD NOT WRITTEN OR MACKLIN HAD NOT ACTED THE PART SO POWERFULLY
7277-106407-0028 MY IMAGINATION FORMED SUCH A STRONG CONCEPTION OF THE PAIN THE JEWESS WAS FEELING AND MY INVERTED SYMPATHY IF I MAY SO CALL IT SO OVERPOWERED MY DIRECT AND NATURAL FEELINGS THAT AT EVERY FRESH DEVELOPMENT OF THE JEW'S VILLANY I SHRUNK AS THOUGH I HAD MYSELF BEEN A JEW
7277-106407-0029 EACH EXCLAMATION AGAINST THIS DOG OF A JEW AND STILL MORE EVERY GENERAL REFLECTION ON JEWISH USURY AVARICE AND CRUELTY I FELT POIGNANTLY NO POWER OF IMAGINATION COULD MAKE ME PITY SHYLOCK BUT I FELT THE FORCE OF SOME OF HIS APPEALS TO JUSTICE
7277-106407-0030 AND SOME PASSAGES STRUCK ME IN QUITE A NEW LIGHT ON THE JEWISH SIDE OF THE QUESTION MANY A TIME AND OFT IN THE RIALTO YOU HAVE RATED ME ABOUT MY MONEYS AND MY USANCES STILL HAVE I BORNE IT WITH A PATIENT SHRUG
7277-106407-0031 SHOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT HIS LOSSES THWARTED HIS BARGAINS COOLED HIS FRIENDS HEATED HIS ENEMIES SHYLOCK DESERVED ALL THIS BUT WHEN HE CAME TO WHAT'S HIS REASON I AM A JEW
7277-106407-0032 WARMED AND COOLED BY THE SAME WINTER AND SUMMER AS A CHRISTIAN IS IF YOU PRICK US DO WE NOT BLEED IF YOU TICKLE US DO WE NOT LAUGH IF YOU POISON US DO NOT WE DIE AND IF YOU WRONG US SHALL WE NOT REVENGE
7277-106407-0033 IF WE ARE LIKE YOU IN THE REST WE WILL RESEMBLE YOU IN THAT IF A JEW WRONG A CHRISTIAN WHAT IS HIS HUMILITY REVENGE IF A CHRISTIAN WRONG A JEW WHAT SHOULD HIS SUFFERANCE BE BY CHRISTIAN EXAMPLE WHY REVENGE
7277-106407-0034 I FELT AT ONCE HORROR OF THE INDIVIDUAL SHYLOCK AND SUBMISSION TO THE STRENGTH OF HIS APPEAL DURING THE THIRD ACT DURING THE JESSICA SCENES I LONGED SO MUCH TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE JEWESS THAT I TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF CHANGING MY POSITION
7277-106407-0035 THE LADIES IN OUR BOX WERE NOW SO HAPPILY OCCUPIED WITH SOME YOUNG OFFICERS OF THE GUARDS THAT THERE WAS NO FARTHER DANGER OF THEIR STARING AT THE JEWESS I WAS SO PLACED THAT I COULD SEE HER WITHOUT BEING SEEN
7277-106407-0036 AND DURING THE SUCCEEDING ACTS MY ATTENTION WAS CHIEFLY DIRECTED TO THE STUDY OF ALL THE CHANGES IN HER EXPRESSIVE COUNTENANCE I NOW SAW AND HEARD THE PLAY SOLELY WITH REFERENCE TO HER FEELINGS I ANTICIPATED EVERY STROKE WHICH COULD TOUCH HER
7277-106407-0037 FROM THE PERCEPTION THAT MY ANTICIPATIONS WERE JUST AND THAT I PERFECTLY KNEW HOW TO READ HER SOUL AND INTERPRET HER COUNTENANCE I SAW THAT THE STRUGGLE TO REPRESS HER EMOTION WAS OFTEN THE UTMOST SHE COULD ENDURE AND AT LAST I SAW OR FANCIED I SAW
7277-106407-0038 THAT SHE GREW SO PALE THAT AS SHE CLOSED HER EYES AT THE SAME INSTANT I WAS CERTAIN SHE WAS GOING TO FAINT AND QUITE FORGETTING THAT I WAS AN UTTER STRANGER TO HER I STARTED FORWARD AND THEN UNPROVIDED WITH AN APOLOGY COULD ONLY TURN TO MISSUS COATES
7277-106407-0039 MISSUS COATES ALARMED IMMEDIATELY WISHED THEY COULD GET HER OUT INTO THE AIR AND REGRETTED THAT HER GENTLEMEN WERE NOT WITH THEIR PARTY TO NIGHT THERE COULD BE NO GETTING SERVANTS OR CARRIAGE WHAT COULD BE DONE
7277-106407-0040 I EAGERLY OFFERED MY SERVICES WHICH WERE ACCEPTED AND WE CONDUCTED THE YOUNG LADY OUT SHE DID NOT FAINT SHE STRUGGLED AGAINST IT AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THERE WAS NO AFFECTATION IN THE CASE BUT ON THE CONTRARY AN ANXIOUS DESIRE NOT TO GIVE TROUBLE
7277-106407-0041 MISS BERRY DID HER UTMOST TO SUPPORT HERSELF AND SAID SHE BELIEVED SHE WAS NOW QUITE WELL AND COULD RETURN BUT I SAW SHE WISHED TO GET AWAY AND I RAN TO SEE IF A CHAIR COULD BE HAD
7277-106407-0042 LORD MOWBRAY WHO HAD ASSISTED IN CONDUCTING THE LADIES OUT NOW FOLLOWED ME HE SAW AND CALLED TO ONE OF HIS FOOTMEN AND DESPATCHED HIM FOR A CHAIR THERE NOW SAID MOWBRAY WE MAY LEAVE THE REST TO MISSUS COATES WHO CAN ELBOW HER OWN WAY THROUGH IT COME BACK WITH ME
7277-106407-0043 MISSUS ABINGDON PLAYS LADY BAB LARDOON HER FAVOURITE CHARACTER SHE IS INCOMPARABLE AND I WOULD NOT MISS IT FOR THE WORLD I BEGGED MOWBRAY TO GO BACK FOR I COULD NOT LEAVE THESE LADIES WELL SAID HE PARTING FROM ME AND PURSUING HIS OWN WAY
7277-106407-0044 I SEE HOW IT IS I SEE HOW IT WILL BE THESE THINGS ARE RULED IN HEAVEN ABOVE OR HELL BENEATH TIS IN VAIN STRUGGLING WITH ONE'S DESTINY SO YOU TO YOUR JEWESS AND I TO MY LITTLE JESSICA WE SHALL HAVE HER AGAIN I HOPE IN THE FARCE THE PRETTIEST CREATURE I EVER SAW
7277-106407-0045 MISSUS COATES ALL THANKS AND APOLOGIES AND HURRY NOW LITERALLY ELBOWED HER WAY BACK TO HER BOX EXPRESSING HER REITERATED FEARS THAT WE SHOULD LOSE THE BEST PART OF THE MAID OF THE OAKS WHICH WAS THE ONLY FARCE SHE MADE IT A RULE EVER TO STAY FOR
7277-106407-0046 IN SPITE OF HER HURRY AND HER INCESSANT TALKING I NAMED THE THING I WAS INTENT UPON I SAID THAT WITH HER PERMISSION I SHOULD DO MYSELF THE HONOUR OF CALLING UPON HER THE NEXT MORNING TO INQUIRE AFTER MISS BERRY'S HEALTH
7277-106407-0047 I AM SURE SIR SHE REPLIED MISTER ALDERMAN COATES AND MYSELF WILL BE PARTICULARLY GLAD OF THE HONOUR OF SEEING YOU TOMORROW OR ANY TIME AND MOREOVER SIR THE YOUNG LADY ADDED SHE WITH A SHREWD AND TO ME OFFENSIVE SMILE
7277-106407-0048 AS RICH AS A JEW SHE'LL BE MISS MONTENERO MISS MONTENERO REPEATED LORD MOWBRAY AND I IN THE SAME INSTANT I THOUGHT SAID I THIS YOUNG LADY'S NAME WAS BERRY BERRY YES BERRY WE CALL HER WE WHO ARE INTIMATE
7277-106407-0049 WHICH IS HER OUT O THE WAY CHRISTIAN THAT IS JEWISH NAME MISTER MONTENERO THE FATHER IS A SPANISH OR AMERICAN JEW I'M NOT CLEAR WHICH BUT HE'S A CHARMING MAN FOR A JEW AND THE DAUGHTER MOST UNCOMMON FOND OF HIM TO A DEGREE
7277-106407-0050 CAN'T NOW BEAR ANY REFLECTIONS THE MOST DISTANT NOW SIR UPON THE JEWS WHICH WAS WHAT DISTRESSED ME WHEN I FOUND THE PLAY WAS TO BE THIS JEW OF VENICE
7277-106407-0051 DIGRESSED INTO A SUBJECT UTTERLY UNINTERESTING TO ME AND WOULD EXPLAIN TO US THE REASONS WHY MISTER ALDERMAN COATES AND MISTER PETER COATES HER SON WERE NOT THIS NIGHT OF HER PARTY
7277-106407-0052 THIS LASTED TILL WE REACHED HER BOX AND THEN SHE HAD SO MUCH TO SAY TO ALL THE MISS ISSYS CECYS AND HENNYS THAT IT WAS WITH THE UTMOST DIFFICULTY I COULD EVEN BY CAREFULLY WATCHING MY MOMENT OBTAIN A CARD WITH HER OWN AND ANOTHER WITH MISS MONTENERO'S ADDRESS
