6676-71414-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MARGARET TOM I TELL YOU THE BEST YOU CAN DO IS TO MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT AND GET UNCLE ADAM
6676-71414-0001 TO HELP YOU IT WAS LETTY BERNARD WHO SPOKE
6676-71414-0002 OR OF BEING OVERHEARD THE CONVERSATION HAD LASTED OVER TWO HOURS AND IN THAT TIME THE GIRL HAD LEARNED MANY OF THE YOUNG MAN'S SECRETS AND IN RETURN
6676-71414-0003 HAD TOLD HIM A FEW THINGS WHICH HAD ASTONISHED AND DISTURBED HIM HE WAS MUCH DOWNCAST AND WITH GOOD REASON FOR THE PAST MONTH MANY THINGS HAD GONE WRONG WITH HIM
6676-71414-0004 THE ONE BRIGHT SPOT HAD BEEN LEFTY'S LOVE FOR HIM PURE AND STRONG HELPING HIM TO CARRY HIS BURDENS
6676-71414-0005 THAT'S AN EASY THING TO SAY LETTY HE ANSWERED BUT IT IS NOT SUCH AN EASY THING TO DO POOR DICK IS DEEP ENOUGH IN THE MUD AS IT IS
6676-71414-0006 AND IT WILL NOT BE TO MY CREDIT TO MENTION MY CONNECTION WITH MATLOCK STYLES YES BUT TOM YOU YOU OH HOW CAN I EXPLAIN
6676-71414-0007 CAN'T YOU TRUST ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I AM SPEAKING FOR YOUR OWN GOOD I I KNOW MANY THINGS OF WHICH YOU ARE IGNORANT THEN WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME LETTY
6676-71414-0008 IS IT FAIR FOR YOU TO KEEP SILENT NO BUT THEN YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT I AM MISTER ADAMS PRIVATE CLERK AND HE IS WORKING ON THIS CASE IN THE INTERESTS OF MISS LANGMORE
6676-71414-0009 AND I HOPE HE CLEARS HER I ALWAYS THOUGHT SHE WAS A PRETTY NICE KIND OF A GIRL AND
6676-71414-0010 AND SHE GAZED AT HIM EARNESTLY AS IF TO SEARCH HIS VERY SOUL HE STARTED ME
6676-71414-0011 SHOULD ANYBODY IMAGINE I WAS GUILTY IT'S IT'S OUT OF ALL REASON HE DREW A QUICK BREATH LETTY DO YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE THAT MISTER ADAMS IMAGINES
6676-71414-0012 YOU MUSTN'T ASK ME QUESTIONS TOM
6676-71414-0013 OF THAT LETTER YOUR BROTHER DICK WROTE ASKING FOR MONEY
6676-71414-0014 AND THE SCENE AFTERWARDS YES I KNOW BUT AND THEN THINK OF THE WAY BY WHICH MISTER LANGMORE AND YOUR MOTHER DIED KILLED BY A CURIOUS POISON
6676-71414-0015 SOMETHING THAT THEY INHALED WHICH WHEN THE DOCTOR GOT A WHIFF OF IT GAVE HIM CRAMPS IN THE STOMACH A CURIOUS DRUG NOT GENERALLY KNOWN TO MEDICAL SCIENCE
6676-71414-0016 A DRUG HE CAUGHT HER BY THE WRIST AND LOOKED FEARFULLY FRIGHTFULLY INTO HER FACE
6676-71414-0017 A SHORT SILENCE FOLLOWED AND SHE SAW THAT HE WAS THINKING DEEPLY SWIFTLY THE COLD PERSPIRATION STOOD OUT ON HIS FOREHEAD BUT HE DID NOT APPEAR TO NOTICE IT
6676-71414-0018 HE DROPPED HER WRIST AND HIS HAND FELL AS IF MADE OF STONE NOW YOU UNDERSTAND TOM I I AM SPEAKING FOR I I
6676-71414-0019 WANT YOU TO CLEAR YOURSELF THEN IT HAS GONE AS FAR AS THIS HE GAVE A GROAN IT WAS THAT DRUG LETTY
6676-71414-0020 YES BUT DO NOT SAY I SAID SO
6676-71414-0021 A CHINESE STUDENT TOLD ME SO
6676-71414-0022 BUT NOW I BELIEVE IT THE FIRST TIME I CARRIED IT AROUND WITH ME I WAS WRECKED IN A RAILROAD ACCIDENT AND HAD MY ARM HURT THEN TWO WEEKS LATER WHEN I HAD IT WITH ME
6676-71414-0023 I GOT CAUGHT IN THAT HOTEL FIRE IN BUFFALO AFTER THAT A VIAL ONCE BROKE ON ME AND IF I HADN'T GOTTEN AWAY IN A HURRY I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SMOTHERED AND NOW
6676-71414-0024 HAVE YOU CARRIED ANY OF IT LATELY NO NOT FOR A MONTH
6676-71414-0025 AND SO WAS THE FIRM
6676-71414-0026 MEDITATIVELY AND THEY THINK THEY SUSPECT THAT THAT DRUG WAS USED IT MAY BE CANNOT YOU TRACE WHERE THE DRUG WENT TO TOM
6676-71414-0027 THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE ALTHOUGH A GOOD MANY PEOPLE SAW AND HEARD OF IT WHILE OUR FIRM HANDLED IT WAS ANY OF IT SOLD OR USED IN THE VICINITY OF SIDHAM NO BUT
6676-71414-0028 THE YOUNG COMMERCIAL TRAVELER STOPPED SHORT I THINK BUT NO IT CAN'T BE AND YET WHAT TOM SHE ASKED EAGERLY HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
6676-71414-0029 WHAT'S THE USE IT WOULD ONLY DRAG ME INTO THE MUD DEEPER I REALLY CAN'T SEE WHAT'S TO DO
6676-71414-0030 I AM CERTAIN THE VERY BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS TO GO TO UNCLE ADAM AND TELL HIM EVERYTHING HE WILL HELP YOU AND CLEAR UP THIS GREAT MYSTERY BUT HE IS WORKING FOR MARGARET
6676-71414-0031 BUT I KNOW HE WILL WORK FOR YOU AFTER HE HAS HEARD YOUR STORY BUT YOU MUST TELL HIM EVERYTHING WHERE IS HE NOW SOMEWHERE AROUND YOUR MOTHER'S HOME OR IN SIDHAM I THINK
6676-71414-0032 I CAN FIND OUT FOR YOU VERY WELL I WILL GO TO HIM AND ASK HIM IF HE IS WILLING TO SIDE WITH ME AS WELL AS WITH MARGARET BUT WATT
6676-71414-0033 I THINK I'LL GO AND SEE MARGARET FIRST YOU CAN SEND WORD TO MISTER ADAMS THAT I WANT TO SEE HIM TELL HIM I WILL BE AT THE BEECHWOOD HOTEL HE CAN SEND ME A MESSAGE THERE
6676-71414-0034 TELL HIM I CAN CLEAR UP SOME POINTS WHICH MAY SEEM QUEER TO HIM I WILL TOM LETTY LOOKED MUCH RELIEVED OH I AM SURE HE WILL HELP YOU
6676-71414-0035 HE HAS NEVER YET FAILED TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING HE HAS UNDERTAKEN AN HOUR LATER SAW TOM OSTRELLO ON HIS WAY TO SIDHAM HIS FACE WAS CAREWORN
6676-71414-0036 AND HE LOOKED TO BE TEN YEARS OLDER THAN HE HAD A WEEK BEFORE HE WAS IN A THOUGHTFUL MOOD AND SCARCELY LOOKED OUT OF THE CAR WINDOW AS THE TRAIN
6676-71414-0037 RUSHED ONWARD TO ITS DESTINATION ARRIVING AT THE TOWN HE SPEEDILY LEARNED THAT MARGARET HAD BEEN TAKEN TO THE HOME OF MARTHA SAMPSON AND WAS SAID TO BE IN A SERIOUS
6676-71414-0038 IF NOT DANGEROUS STATE THIS CAUSED HIM TO HALT AND HE WAS HALF INCLINED TO GIVE UP THE IDEA OF INTERVIEWING HER IT WILL ONLY MAKE HER CONDITION WORSE
6676-71414-0039 HE MUSED AND POOR GIRL SHE SEEMS TO HAVE SUFFERED MORE THAN HER SHARE ALREADY PERHAPS I HAD BETTER WAIT UNTIL I HEAR FROM ADAM ADAMS BUT THEN
6676-71414-0040 HE DETERMINED TO LEARN EXACTLY HOW SHE WAS ANYWAY
6676-71414-0041 WHICH STOOD ON A SIDE STREET OF THE TOWN BACKED UP BY A PATCH OF WOODS LEADING TO THE RIVER HE WAS JUST IN SIGHT OF THE PLACE WHEN HE HEARD A CRY
6676-71414-0042 AND A MAN CAME RUNNING OUT OF THE COTTAGE FOLLOWED BY A WOMAN AND A POLICEMAN WHERE IS SHE WHERE IS SHE CRIED THE MAN AND TOM OSTRELLO RECOGNIZED RAYMOND CASE HULLO
6676-71414-0043 QUERIED THE COMMERCIAL TRAVELER MARGARET SHE IS GONE CRIED RAYMOND HE RAN BACK OF THE HOUSE I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING OF HER HE ADDED WITH A GROAN
6676-71414-0044 MARGARET GONE I THOUGHT SHE WAS SICK SO SHE IS
6676-71414-0045 WHILE THE NURSE WENT DOWNSTAIRS FOR SOME BROTH I WAS IN THE PARLOR WRITING A LETTER AND I WAS ON GUARD IN THE HALLWAY PUT IN THE POLICEMAN SHE DIDN'T PASS ME THAT I'LL SWEAR TO
6676-71414-0046 I WAS ONLY GONE A FEW MINUTES SAID THE NURSE AND I AM SURE SHE DID NOT GO THROUGH THE KITCHEN HOW LONG AGO WAS THIS

6676-71414-0048 SOON THE NEWS SPREAD AND THE CHIEF OF POLICE CAME HURRYING TO THE SCENE COLLINS
6676-71414-0049 SAID HE STERNLY TO THE POLICEMAN I DID THE BEST I COULD SIR WAS THE NERVOUS ANSWER SHE WAS THAT SICK SIR I DIDN'T THINK SHE COULD GET OUT OF BED
6676-71414-0050 MUCH LESS WALK OFF PERHAPS SHE IS HIDING IN THE HOUSE THE BUILDING WAS SEARCHED FROM CELLAR TO GARRET AND SO WERE SEVERAL OTHER BUILDINGS IN THAT VICINITY
6676-71414-0051 BUT WITHOUT AVAIL THEN THE GATHERING CROWD SCATTERED THROUGH THE WOODS AND ALONG THE RIVER I DON'T BELIEVE SHE WAS AS SICK AS THEY PRETENDED SAID ONE OF THE NUMBER

6676-71414-0053 AND OVER THE EYES OF THAT YOUNG FELLOW WHO'S IN LOVE WITH HER TOO RAYMOND HEARD SOME OF THESE REMARKS AND THEY MADE HIS FACE BURN HE LONGED TO KNOCK SOME OF THE SPEAKERS DOWN
6676-71414-0054 HE REALIZED THAT NO ARGUMENT HE MIGHT ADVANCE WOULD MAKE AN IMPRESSION WHERE OPINIONS WERE SO SET TOM OSTRELLO JOINED IN THE SEARCH AS DILIGENTLY AS THE REST
6676-71414-0055 AND HE AND RAYMOND RAN THROUGH THE WOODS FROM END TO END SEVERAL TIMES THEN THEY PROCURED A BOAT AND ROWED UP AND DOWN THE RIVER AND CROSSED OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE
6676-71414-0056 SHE COULD NOT HAVE GONE FAR SAID RAYMOND HER STRENGTH WAS NOT EQUAL TO IT IT WAS DARK BY THE TIME THEY CAME BACK TO THE RIVER TO CROSS TO THE TOWN SIDE
6676-71414-0057 AS THEY ROWED ALONG SLOWLY AND SILENTLY TOM OSTRELLO NOTICED SOMETHING FLOATING ON THE WATER HE STEERED TOWARD THE OBJECT AND PICKED IT UP IT WAS A GIRL'S
6676-71414-0058 SUMMER HAT MARGARET'S HAT CRIED RAYMOND HE DROPPED HIS OAR AND HIS FACE TURNED AS WHITE AS DEATH I KNOW THE TRUTH NOW
