2544-13195-0000 SEAL ISLANDS AND SEALERS AM I MY BROTHER'S KEEPER THE ISLANDS IN BASS STRAITS HOGAN'S GROUP KENT'S GROUP THE ANSWERS THE JUDGMENT ROCKS AND OTHERS
2544-13195-0001 WHEN THESE ANIMALS HAVE NOT BEEN DISTURBED IN THEIR RESORTS FOR SOME YEARS THEY ARE COMPARATIVELY TAME AND IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO APPROACH THEM GREAT NUMBERS OF THE YOUNG ONES ARE SOMETIMES FOUND ON THE ROCKS
2544-13195-0002 BUT THE OLD SEALS WHEN FREQUENTLY DISTURBED BECOME SHY AND ON THE FIRST ALARM TAKE TO THE WATER THE FLESH OF THE YOUNG SEALS IS GOOD TO EAT AND SEAMEN WHO HAVE BEEN CAST AWAY ON THE ISLANDS HAVE BEEN SOMETIMES SAVED FROM STARVATION BY EATING IT
2544-13195-0003 I ONCE MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF AN OLD SEALER HE HAD FORMERLY BEEN VERY SENSITIVE ON THE POINT OF HONOUR WOULD RESENT AN INSULT AS PROMPTLY AS ANY KNIGHT ERRANT
2544-13195-0004 AND HAD TAKEN REFUGE FOR A WHILE AT THE BUCK'S HEAD HOTEL THEN KEPT BY A MAN NAMED MC KENZIE ONE EVENING AFTER TEA I WAS TALKING TO A CARPENTER AT THE BACK DOOR WHO WAS LAMENTING HIS WANT OF TIMBER
2544-13195-0005 HE HAD NOT BROUGHT A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY FROM GEELONG TO COMPLETE HIS CONTRACT WHICH WAS TO CONSTRUCT SOME BENCHES FOR A PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH JACK WAS STANDING NEAR LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION
2544-13195-0006 WHOSE PLANKS ARE THEY HE ASKED
2544-13195-0007 SAY THE WORD AND YOU CAN HAVE THEM IF YOU LIKE THE CONTRACTOR MADE NO REPLY AT LEAST IN WORDS TO THIS GENEROUS OFFER IT IS NOT EVERY MAN THAT HAS A FRIEND LIKE JACK MANY MEN WILL STEAL FROM YOU BUT VERY FEW WILL STEAL FOR YOU
2544-13195-0008 AND WHEN SUCH A ONE IS FOUND HE DESERVES HIS REWARD WE ADJOURNED TO THE BAR PARLOUR AND JACK HAD A GLASS OF BRANDY FOR WHICH HE DID NOT PAY
2544-13195-0009 A LEARNED MINERALOGIST WHO COMMENCED A DISSERTATION ON THE ORIGIN OF GOLD HE WAS MOST INSUFFERABLE WOULD TALK ABOUT NOTHING BUT SCIENCE
2544-13195-0010 AND IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED
2544-13195-0011 SO WE ARGUED ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF GOLD BUT WE COULD GET NOWHERE NEAR IT WHEN THE REST OF THE COMPANY HAD RETIRED JACK OBSERVED TO ME YOU PUT DOWN THAT ADELAIDE CHAP GRADELY HE HAD NOT A LEG TO STAND ON
2544-13195-0012 I WAS PLEASED TO FIND THAT JACK KNEW A GOOD ARGUMENT WHEN HE HEARD IT SO I REWARDED HIS INTELLIGENCE WITH ANOTHER GLASS OF BRANDY AND ASKED HIM IF HE HAD BEEN LONG IN THE COLONIES HE SAID
2544-13195-0013 MY NAME'S NOT JACK THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL ME BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT MY NAME IS

2544-13195-0025 AND RUINED FOR EVER JUST FOR NOWT ELSE BUT GIVING A CHANCE LICK TO A BLACKFELLOW
2544-13195-0026 IT DON'T MEND A MAN MUCH TO TRANSPORT HIM NOR A WOMAN EITHER FOR THAT MATTER THEY ALL GROW WORSE THAN EVER
2544-13195-0027 AND SOMETIMES STRIPPING BARK AT WESTERN PORT AND PORTLAND BAY BEFORE THERE WAS SUCH A PLACE AS MELBOURNE I WAS IN A WHALER FOR TWO YEARS ABOUT WILSON'S PROMONTORY UNTIL THE WHALES WERE ALL KILLED OR DRIVEN AWAY
2544-13195-0028 I NEVER SAVED ANY MONEY UNTIL NINE YEARS BACK
2544-13195-0029 AT THAT TIME I WENT WITH A MAN FROM PORT ALBERT TO THE SEAL ISLANDS IN A BOAT I KNEW OF A PLACE WHERE THERE WAS A CAVE A BIG HOLLOW UNDER THE ROCKS
2544-13195-0030 AND HE WAS DROWNED BUT MIND YOU I DIDN'T DO IT IT WAS THIS WAY
2544-13195-0031 AND WENT HEAD FIRST INTO THE BOILING WATER AND OUT OF SIGHT I TOOK HOLD OF THE SLACK OF A ROPE THINKING I'D THROW IT TO HIM HE MIGHT GET HOLD OF IT AND THEN I COULD PULL HIM OUT
2544-13195-0032 I COULD SEE HIS FACE WITHIN FOUR FEET OF ME HE THREW UP HIS HANDS FOR SOMETHING TO CATCH AT AND LOOKED AT ME
2544-13195-0033 I DIDN'T THROW HIM THE ROPE SOMETHING STOPPED ME HE MIGHT NOT HAVE GOT HOLD OF IT YOU KNOW ANYHOW
2544-13195-0034 ONLY WHEN I AM DREAMING
2544-13195-0035 AND WHEN HE SCREAMS I WAKE UP I CAN NEVER GET CLEAR OF HIM OUT OF MY HEAD AND YET MIND YOU I DIDN'T DROWN HIM HE FELL IN OF HIS SELF
2544-13195-0036 I COULD HAVE LIVED COMFORTABLY ON IT ALL MY LIFE BUT IT NEVER DID ME NO GOOD
