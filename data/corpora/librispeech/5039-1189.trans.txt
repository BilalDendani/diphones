5039-1189-0054 HAVING PERFORMED THIS PAINFUL DUTY I SHALL BUT BEFORE HE COULD SAY MORE THE PHONOGRAPH TURNED AND DASHED UP THE ROAD AS FAST AS ITS FOUR TABLE LEGS COULD CARRY IT AND SOON IT HAD ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED FROM THEIR VIEW
5039-1189-0055 THE SHAGGY MAN SAT DOWN AGAIN AND SEEMED WELL PLEASED

5039-1189-0057 EVEN THE FIELDS WERE NO LONGER CULTIVATED AND THE COUNTRY BEGAN TO RESEMBLE A WILDERNESS THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED AND BECAME UNEVEN AND MORE DIFFICULT TO WALK UPON SCRUBBY UNDER BRUSH GREW ON EITHER SIDE OF THE WAY
5039-1189-0058 WHILE HUGE ROCKS WERE SCATTERED AROUND IN ABUNDANCE BUT THIS DID NOT DETER OJO AND HIS FRIENDS FROM TRUDGING ON AND THEY BEGUILED THE JOURNEY WITH JOKES AND CHEERFUL CONVERSATION TOWARD EVENING THEY REACHED A CRYSTAL SPRING WHICH GUSHED FROM A TALL ROCK BY THE ROADSIDE
5039-1189-0059 AND NEAR THIS SPRING STOOD A DESERTED CABIN SAID THE SHAGGY MAN HALTING HERE WE MAY AS WELL PASS THE NIGHT HERE WHERE THERE IS SHELTER FOR OUR HEADS AND GOOD WATER TO DRINK ROAD BEYOND HERE IS PRETTY BAD WORST WE SHALL HAVE TO TRAVEL SO LET'S WAIT UNTIL MORNING BEFORE WE TACKLE IT
