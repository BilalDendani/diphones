7833-102238-0000 THE UNDERSIGNED HEREBY PROTEST AGAINST THE PASSAGE OF THE SAME THEY BELIEVE THAT THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY IS FOUNDED ON BOTH INJUSTICE AND BAD POLICY
7833-102238-0001 BUT THAT THE POWER OUGHT NOT TO BE EXERCISED UNLESS AT THE REQUEST OF THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE OPINIONS AND THOSE CONTAINED IN THE ABOVE RESOLUTIONS IS THEIR REASON FOR ENTERING THIS PROTEST SIGNED DAN STONE
7833-102238-0002 AND THIS REMAINED IN FORCE IN THE ILLINOIS COUNTRY AFTER ITS SEPARATION ANOTHER ACT PROVIDING FOR THE HIRING OF SLAVES FROM SOUTHERN STATES WAS PASSED IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN FOR THE OSTENSIBLE REASON THAT
7833-102238-0003 MILLS COULD NOT BE SUCCESSFULLY OPERATED IN THE TERRITORY FOR WANT OF LABORERS AND THAT THE MANUFACTURE OF SALT COULD NOT BE SUCCESSFULLY CARRIED ON BY WHITE LABORERS
7833-102238-0004 FROM TIME TO TIME THE MOST SAVAGE ACTS WERE PASSED TO PROHIBIT THE IMMIGRATION OF FREE NEGROES INTO THE TERRITORY WHICH WAS REPRESENTED AS PINING FOR BLACK LABOR THOSE WHO HELD SLAVES UNDER THE FRENCH DOMINATION AND THEIR HEIRS
7833-102238-0005 CONTINUED TO HOLD THEM AND THEIR DESCENDANTS IN SERVITUDE AFTER ILLINOIS HAD BECOME NOMINALLY A FREE TERRITORY AND A FREE STATE ON THE GROUND THAT THEIR VESTED RIGHTS OF PROPERTY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABROGATED BY THE ORDINANCE
7833-102238-0006 AND THAT UNDER THE RULE OF THE CIVIL LAW PARTUS SEQUITUR VENTREM BUT THIS QUASI TOLERATION OF THE INSTITUTION WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THE ADVOCATES OF SLAVERY SOON AFTER THE ADOPTION OF THE STATE CONSTITUTION WHICH PROHIBITED SLAVERY HEREAFTER
7833-102238-0007 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THERE WAS A STRONG UNDER CURRENT OF DESIRE FOR ITS INTRODUCTION INTO THE STATE SOME OF THE LEADING POLITICIANS EXAGGERATING THE EXTENT OF THIS DESIRE IMAGINED THEY SAW IN IT A MEANS OF PERSONAL ADVANCEMENT
7833-102238-0008 AND BEGAN TO AGITATE THE QUESTION OF A CONVENTION TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION AT THAT TIME THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE EMIGRATION SETTING THROUGH THE STATE FROM KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE TO MISSOURI
7833-102238-0009 TRIPS OF BUSINESS OR PLEASURE THEY DAZZLED THE EYES OF THE WOMEN AND EXCITED THE ENVY OF THEIR MALE RIVALS WITH THEIR BLACK RETAINERS THE EARLY ILLINOISANS WERE PERPLEXED WITH A SECRET AND SINGULAR SENSE OF INFERIORITY
7833-102238-0010 THEY ARE TO BE CONSIDERED AS GENTLEFOLKS ENTITLED TO HIGHER CONSIDERATION THAN US PLAIN FREE STATE FOLKS WHO HAVE TO WORK FOR OURSELVES THE ATTEMPT
7833-102238-0011 THE GOVERNOR EDWARD COLES OF VIRGINIA A STRONG ANTISLAVERY MAN HAD BEEN ELECTED BY A DIVISION OF THE PRO SLAVERY PARTY BUT CAME IN WITH A LEGISLATURE LARGELY AGAINST HIM THE SENATE HAD THE REQUISITE PRO SLAVERY MAJORITY OF TWO THIRDS FOR A CONVENTION
7833-102238-0012 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES THERE WAS A CONTEST FOR A SEAT UPON THE RESULT OF WHICH THE TWO THIRDS MAJORITY DEPENDED THE SEAT WAS CLAIMED BY JOHN SHAW AND NICHOLAS HANSEN OF PIKE COUNTY
7833-102238-0013 THE WAY IN WHICH THE CONTEST WAS DECIDED AFFORDS A CURIOUS ILLUSTRATION OF THE MORAL SENSE OF THE ADVOCATES OF SLAVERY THEY WANTED AT THIS SESSION TO ELECT A SENATOR AND PROVIDE FOR THE CONVENTION HANSEN WOULD VOTE FOR THEIR SENATOR
7833-102238-0014 AND NOT FOR THE CONVENTION SHAW WOULD VOTE FOR THE CONVENTION BUT NOT FOR THOMAS THEIR CANDIDATE FOR SENATOR
7833-102238-0015 BUT IMPARTIALLY TO USE BOTH THEY GAVE THE SEAT TO HANSEN AND WITH HIS VOTE ELECTED THOMAS THEY THEN TURNED HIM OUT GAVE THE PLACE TO SHAW
7833-102238-0016 THEY WERE NOT MORE MAGNANIMOUS IN THEIR VICTORY THAN SCRUPULOUS IN THE MEANS BY WHICH THEY HAD GAINED IT THE NIGHT AFTER THE VOTE WAS TAKEN THEY FORMED IN A WILD AND DRUNKEN PROCESSION AND VISITED THE RESIDENCES OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE OTHER FREE STATE LEADERS
7833-102238-0017 WITH LOUD AND INDECENT DEMONSTRATIONS OF TRIUMPH THEY CONSIDERED THEIR SUCCESS ALREADY ASSURED BUT THEY LEFT OUT OF VIEW THE VALUE OF THE MORAL FORCES CALLED INTO BEING BY THEIR INSOLENT CHALLENGE THE BETTER CLASS OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE
7833-102238-0018 THOSE HERETOFORE UNKNOWN IN POLITICS THE SCHOOLMASTERS THE MINISTERS
7833-102238-0019 WAS INDICTED AND SEVERELY FINED FOR HAVING BROUGHT HIS OWN FREEDMEN INTO THE STATE AND HAVING ASSISTED THEM IN ESTABLISHING THEMSELVES AROUND HIM UPON FARMS OF THEIR OWN THE LEGISLATURE REMITTED THE FINE
7833-102238-0020 BUT THE CIRCUIT COURT DECLARED IT HAD NO CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO DO SO THOUGH THE SUPREME COURT AFTERWARDS OVERRULED THIS DECISION ANY MENTION OF THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY WAS THOUGHT IN THE WORST POSSIBLE TASTE AND NO ONE COULD AVOW HIMSELF OPPOSED TO IT
7833-102238-0021 WITHOUT THE RISK OF SOCIAL OSTRACISM EVERY TOWN HAD ITS ONE OR TWO ABOLITIONISTS WHO WERE REGARDED AS HARMLESS OR DANGEROUS LUNATICS ACCORDING TO THE ENERGY WITH WHICH THEY MADE THEIR VIEWS KNOWN
7833-102238-0022 FROM THIS AROSE A SINGULAR PREJUDICE AGAINST NEW ENGLAND PEOPLE IT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE PARTLY TO THE NATURAL FEELING OF DISTRUST OF STRANGERS WHICH IS COMMON TO IGNORANCE AND PROVINCIALISM BUT STILL MORE
7833-102238-0023 TO A GENERAL SUSPICION THAT ALL EASTERN MEN WERE ABOLITIONISTS MISTER COOK WHO SO LONG REPRESENTED THE STATE IN CONGRESS USED TO RELATE WITH MUCH AMUSEMENT HOW HE ONCE SPENT THE NIGHT IN A FARMER'S CABIN AND LISTENED TO THE HONEST MAN'S DENUNCIATIONS OF
7833-102238-0024 THAT YANKEE COOK COOK WAS A KENTUCKIAN BUT HIS ENEMIES COULD THINK OF NO MORE DREADFUL STIGMA TO APPLY TO HIM THAN THAT OF CALLING HIM A YANKEE SENATOR JAMES A MC DOUGALL ONCE TOLD US THAT ALTHOUGH HE MADE NO PRETENSE OF CONCEALING HIS EASTERN NATIVITY
7833-102238-0025 HE NEVER COULD KEEP HIS ARDENT FRIENDS IN PIKE COUNTY FROM DENYING THE FACT AND FIGHTING ANY ONE WHO ASSERTED IT THE GREAT PREACHER PETER CARTWRIGHT USED TO DENOUNCE EASTERN MEN ROUNDLY IN HIS SERMONS CALLING THEM
7833-102238-0026 IMPS WHO LIVED ON OYSTERS INSTEAD OF HONEST CORN BREAD AND BACON THE TAINT OF SLAVERY THE CONTAGION OF A PLAGUE THEY HAD NOT QUITE ESCAPED WAS ON THE PEOPLE OF ILLINOIS THEY WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO RISE ONCE IN THEIR MIGHT
7833-102238-0027 THEIR READINESS TO DO WHAT CAME TO BE CALLED LATER IN A FAMOUS SPEECH THE DIRTY WORK OF THE SOUTH WAS SEEN
7833-102238-0028 IN THIS VERY YEAR OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN HE HAD FOR SOME YEARS BEEN PUBLISHING A RELIGIOUS NEWSPAPER IN SAINT LOUIS BUT FINDING THE ATMOSPHERE OF THAT CITY BECOMING DANGEROUS TO HIM ON ACCOUNT OF THE FREEDOM OF HIS COMMENTS UPON SOUTHERN INSTITUTIONS
7833-102238-0029 HE MOVED TO ALTON IN ILLINOIS TWENTY FIVE MILES FURTHER UP THE RIVER HIS ARRIVAL EXCITED AN IMMEDIATE TUMULT IN THAT PLACE A MOB GATHERED THERE ON THE DAY HE CAME IT WAS SUNDAY AND THE GOOD PEOPLE WERE AT LEISURE
7833-102238-0030 AND THREW HIS PRESS INTO THE MISSISSIPPI HAVING THUS EXPRESSED THEIR DETERMINATION TO VINDICATE THE LAW THEY HELD A MEETING AND CITED HIM BEFORE IT TO DECLARE HIS INTENTIONS HE SAID THEY WERE ALTOGETHER PEACEFUL AND LEGAL
7833-102238-0031 THAT HE INTENDED TO PUBLISH A RELIGIOUS NEWSPAPER AND NOT TO MEDDLE WITH POLITICS THIS SEEMED SATISFACTORY TO THE PEOPLE AND HE WAS ALLOWED TO FISH OUT HIS PRESS BUY NEW TYPES AND SET UP HIS PAPER BUT MISTER LOVEJOY WAS A PREDESTINED MARTYR
7833-102238-0032 HE FELT THERE WAS A WOE UPON HIM IF HE HELD HIS PEACE AGAINST THE WICKEDNESS ACROSS THE RIVER HE WROTE AND PUBLISHED WHAT WAS IN HIS HEART TO SAY AND ALTON WAS AGAIN VEHEMENTLY MOVED A COMMITTEE APPOINTED ITSELF TO WAIT UPON HIM
7833-102238-0033 WHICH MAKES IT SEEM TO THE PARTICIPANTS LEGAL AND ORDERLY THE PREACHER MET THEM WITH AN UNDAUNTED FRONT AND TOLD THEM HE MUST DO HIS DUTY AS IT APPEARED TO HIM THAT HE WAS AMENABLE TO LAW BUT NOTHING ELSE HE EVEN SPOKE IN CONDEMNATION OF MOBS
7833-102238-0034 SUCH LANGUAGE FROM A MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL SHOCKED AND INFURIATED THE COMMITTEE AND THOSE WHOM THEY REPRESENTED THE PEOPLE ASSEMBLED SAYS GOVERNOR FORD AND QUIETLY TOOK THE PRESS AND TYPES AND THREW THEM INTO THE RIVER WE VENTURE TO SAY THAT THE WORD QUIETLY
7833-102238-0035 AND WHICH HE FIRMLY REJECTED THE THREATS OF THE MOB WERE ANSWERED BY DEFIANCE FROM THE LITTLE BAND THAT SURROUNDED THE ABOLITIONIST A NEW PRESS WAS ORDERED AND ARRIVED AND WAS STORED IN A WAREHOUSE WHERE LOVEJOY AND HIS FRIENDS SHUT THEMSELVES UP
7833-102238-0036 DETERMINED TO DEFEND IT WITH THEIR LIVES THEY WERE THERE BESIEGED BY THE INFURIATED CROWD AND AFTER A SHORT INTERCHANGE OF SHOTS LOVEJOY WAS KILLED HIS FRIENDS DISPERSED AND THE PRESS ONCE MORE AND THIS TIME FINALLY
7833-102238-0037 HAD SINCE EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE BEEN POURING FORTH ONCE A WEEK IN THE LIBERATOR HIS EARNEST AND ELOQUENT DENUNCIATIONS OF SLAVERY TAKING NO ACCOUNT OF THE EXPEDIENT OR THE POSSIBLE BUT DEMANDING WITH ALL THE FERVOR OF AN ANCIENT PROPHET
7833-102238-0038 THE IMMEDIATE REMOVAL OF THE CAUSE OF OFFENSE OLIVER JOHNSON ATTACKED THE NATIONAL SIN AND WRONG IN THE STANDARD WITH ZEAL AND ENERGY EQUALLY HOT AND UNTIRING
7833-102238-0039 THEIR WORDS STUNG THE SLAVE HOLDING STATES TO SOMETHING LIKE FRENZY THE GEORGIA LEGISLATURE OFFERED A REWARD OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ANY ONE WHO SHOULD KIDNAP GARRISON OR WHO SHOULD BRING TO CONVICTION ANY ONE CIRCULATING THE LIBERATOR IN THE STATE
7833-102238-0040 YET SO LITTLE KNOWN IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOODS WERE THESE EARLY WORKERS IN THIS GREAT REFORM THAT WHEN THE MAYOR OF BOSTON RECEIVED REMONSTRANCES FROM CERTAIN SOUTHERN STATES AGAINST SUCH AN INCENDIARY PUBLICATION AS THE LIBERATOR HE WAS ABLE TO SAY
7833-102238-0041 THAT NO MEMBER OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT AND NO PERSON OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE HAD EVER HEARD OF THE PAPER OR ITS EDITOR THAT ON SEARCH BEING MADE IT WAS FOUND THAT HIS OFFICE WAS AN OBSCURE HOLE HIS ONLY VISIBLE AUXILIARY A NEGRO BOY
7833-102238-0042 PETITIONS TO CONGRESS WHICH WERE MET BY GAG LAWS CONSTANTLY INCREASING IN SEVERITY
7833-102238-0043 PROHIBIT UNDER SEVERE PENALTIES THE FURTHER PROGRESS OF SUCH INCENDIARY PROCEEDINGS AS WERE CALCULATED TO STIMULATE THE SLAVES TO INSURRECTION AND TO PRODUCE ALL THE HORRORS OF CIVIL WAR BUT IN SPITE OF ALL THIS
7833-102238-0044 PEOPLE WITH UNEASY CONSCIENCES CONTINUED TO WRITE AND TALK AND PETITION CONGRESS AGAINST SLAVERY AND MOST OF THE STATE LEGISLATURES BEGAN TO PASS RESOLUTIONS DENOUNCING THEM IN THE LAST DAYS OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX GOVERNOR DUNCAN SENT TO THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE
7833-102238-0045 CANNOT ABOLISH SLAVERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AGAINST THE CONSENT OF THE CITIZENS OF SAID DISTRICT WITHOUT A MANIFEST BREACH OF GOOD FAITH AND REQUESTING THE GOVERNOR TO TRANSMIT TO THE STATES WHICH HAD SENT THEIR RESOLUTIONS TO HIM
7833-102238-0046 A COPY OF THOSE TRANQUILIZING EXPRESSIONS A LONG AND DRAGGING DEBATE ENSUED OF WHICH NO RECORD HAS BEEN PRESERVED THE RESOLUTIONS AFTER NUMBERLESS AMENDMENTS HAD BEEN VOTED UPON WERE FINALLY PASSED IN THE SENATE UNANIMOUSLY
7833-102238-0047 IN THE HOUSE WITH NONE BUT LINCOLN AND FIVE OTHERS IN THE NEGATIVE FOOTNOTE WE ARE UNDER OBLIGATIONS TO JOHN M ADAIR FOR TRANSCRIPTS OF THE STATE RECORDS BEARING ON THIS MATTER
7833-102238-0048 THERE WAS NO REASON THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN SHOULD TAKE ESPECIAL NOTICE OF THESE RESOLUTIONS MORE THAN ANOTHER HE HAD DONE HIS WORK AT THIS SESSION IN EFFECTING THE REMOVAL OF THE CAPITAL HE HAD ONLY TO SHRUG HIS SHOULDERS AT THE VIOLENCE AND UNTRUTHFULNESS OF THE MAJORITY
7833-102238-0049 VOTE AGAINST THEM AND GO BACK TO HIS ADMIRING CONSTITUENTS TO HIS DINNERS AND HIS TOASTS BUT HIS CONSCIENCE AND HIS REASON FORBADE HIM TO BE SILENT HE FELT A WORD MUST BE SAID ON THE OTHER SIDE TO REDRESS THE DISTORTED BALANCE
7833-102238-0050 HE WROTE HIS PROTEST SAYING NOT ONE WORD HE WAS NOT READY TO STAND BY THEN AND THEREAFTER WASTING NOT A SYLLABLE IN RHETORIC OR FEELING KEEPING CLOSE TO LAW AND TRUTH AND JUSTICE WHEN HE HAD FINISHED IT HE SHOWED IT TO SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR ADHESION
7833-102238-0051 BUT ONE AND ALL REFUSED EXCEPT DAN STONE WHO WAS NOT A CANDIDATE FOR REELECTION HAVING RETIRED FROM POLITICS TO A SEAT ON THE BENCH THE RISK WAS TOO GREAT FOR THE REST TO RUN LINCOLN WAS TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD
7833-102238-0052 AFTER A YOUTH OF SINGULAR PRIVATIONS AND STRUGGLES HE HAD ARRIVED AT AN ENVIABLE POSITION IN THE POLITICS AND THE SOCIETY OF THE STATE HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS THOSE WHOM HE LOVED AND HONORED WERE BROWNING BUTLER LOGAN AND STUART KENTUCKIANS ALL
7833-102238-0053 COULD NOT WITHHOLD HIM FROM PERFORMING A SIMPLE DUTY A DUTY WHICH NO ONE COULD HAVE BLAMED HIM FOR LEAVING UNDONE THE CROWNING GRACE OF THE WHOLE ACT IS IN THE CLOSING SENTENCE
7833-102238-0054 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE OPINIONS AND THOSE CONTAINED IN THE SAID RESOLUTIONS IS THEIR REASON FOR ENTERING THIS PROTEST REASON ENOUGH FOR THE LINCOLNS AND LUTHERS HE HAD MANY YEARS OF GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT BEFORE HIM
7833-102238-0055 THERE WAS A LONG DISTANCE TO BE TRAVERSED BETWEEN THE GUARDED UTTERANCES OF THIS PROTEST AND THE HEROIC AUDACITY WHICH LAUNCHED THE PROCLAMATION OF EMANCIPATION
7833-102238-0056 IN THE MIDST OF A COMMUNITY IMBUED WITH SLAVE STATE SUPERSTITIONS THAT
7833-102238-0057 ATTACKING THUS ITS MORAL AND MATERIAL SUPPORTS
7833-102238-0058 HAD IN HIM THE MAKING OF A STATESMAN AND IF NEED BE A MARTYR HIS WHOLE CAREER WAS TO RUN IN THE LINES MARKED OUT BY THESE WORDS WRITTEN IN THE HURRY OF A CLOSING SESSION
