8183-118119-0001 ARCHER DECLARED THAT HE HAD BEEN VERY BADLY TREATED BY THE DOCTOR WHICH HE URGED AS HIS REASON FOR LEAVING TRUE THE DOCTOR HAD BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO ALLOW HIM TO HIRE HIS TIME FOR WHICH HE REQUIRED ARCHER TO PAY THE MODERATE SUM
8183-118119-0002 OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS PER ANNUM AS ARCHER HAD BEEN SICKLY MOST OF THE TIME DURING THE LAST YEAR HE COMPLAINED THAT THERE WAS NO REDUCTION IN HIS HIRE ON THIS ACCOUNT UPON REFLECTION THEREFORE ARCHER THOUGHT
8183-118119-0003 IF HE HAD JUSTICE DONE HIM HE WOULD BE IN POSSESSION OF THIS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY HIMSELF AND ALL HIS OTHER RIGHTS INSTEAD OF HAVING TO TOIL FOR ANOTHER WITHOUT PAY SO HE LOOKED SERIOUSLY INTO THE MATTER OF MASTER AND SLAVE
8183-118119-0004 AND PRETTY SOON RESOLVED THAT IF OTHERS CHOSE TO MAKE NO EFFORT TO GET AWAY FOR HIMSELF HE WOULD NEVER BE CONTENTED UNTIL HE WAS FREE WHEN A SLAVE REACHED THIS DECISION HE WAS IN A VERY HOPEFUL STATE

8183-118119-0007 HE WAS A MAN OF DARK COLOR ALTHOUGH NOT TOTALLY FREE FROM THE ADMIXTURE OF THE SUPERIOR SOUTHERN BLOOD IN HIS VEINS IN STATURE HE WAS ONLY ORDINARY FOR LEAVING HE GAVE THE FOLLOWING REASONS
8183-118119-0008 AND WHEN I WAS SICK I HAD TO PAY JUST AS MUCH AS IF I WERE WELL SEVEN DOLLARS A MONTH BUT MY MASTER WAS CROSS AND SAID THAT HE INTENDED TO SELL ME TO DO BETTER BY ME ANOTHER YEAR TIMES GREW WORSE AND WORSE CONSTANTLY
8183-118119-0009 I THOUGHT AS I HAD HEARD THAT IF I COULD RAISE THIRTY DOLLARS I COULD COME AWAY HE AT ONCE SAW THE VALUE OF MONEY TO HIS MIND IT MEANT LIBERTY FROM THAT MOMENT THENCEFORTH HE DECIDED TO TREASURE UP EVERY DOLLAR HE COULD GET HOLD OF
8183-118119-0010 UNTIL HE COULD ACCUMULATE AT LEAST ENOUGH TO GET OUT OF OLD VIRGINIA HE WAS A MARRIED MAN AND THOUGHT HE HAD A WIFE AND ONE CHILD BUT ON REFLECTION HE FOUND OUT THAT THEY DID NOT ACTUALLY BELONG TO HIM BUT TO A CARPENTER BY THE NAME OF BAILEY

8183-118119-0014 THEY WERE PRETTY THOROUGHLY ALARMED AND FELT VERY ANXIOUS TO BE SAFELY OFF TO CANADA WHILE THE COMMITTEE ALWAYS RENDERED IN SUCH CASES IMMEDIATE PROTECTION AND AID THEY NEVERTHELESS FELT IN VIEW OF THE IMMINENT DANGERS EXISTING UNDER THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW
8183-118119-0015 AND THEY VERY FULLY REALIZED THEIR FOLLY IN STOPPING IN NEW JERSEY THE COMMITTEE PROCURED THEIR TICKETS HELPED THEM TO DISGUISE THEMSELVES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND ADMONISHED THEM NOT TO STOP SHORT OF CANADA HETTY SCOTT
8183-118119-0016 IN THIS DISOBEDIENT STATE OF MIND SHE DETERMINED IF HARD STRUGGLING WOULD ENABLE HER TO DEFEAT THE THREATS OF MISTER DANIEL COOLBY THAT HE SHOULD NOT MUCH LONGER HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF ENJOYING THE FRUIT OF THE TOIL OF HERSELF AND OFFSPRING
8183-118119-0017 SHE AT ONCE BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR HER JOURNEY SHE HAD THREE CHILDREN OF HER OWN TO BRING BESIDES SHE WAS INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH A YOUNG MAN AND A YOUNG WOMAN BOTH SLAVES

8183-118119-0022 AND IN TALKING WITH HIM A LITTLE WHILE IT WAS SOON DISCOVERED THAT SLAVERY HAD NOT CRUSHED ALL THE BRAINS OUT OF HIS HEAD BY A GOOD DEAL NOR WAS HE SO MUCH ATTACHED TO HIS KIND HEARTED MASTER JOHN EDWARD JACKSON OF ANNE ARUNDEL MARYLAND OR HIS OLD FIDDLE
8183-118119-0023 THAT HE WAS CONTENTED AND HAPPY WHILE IN BONDAGE FAR FROM IT THE FACT WAS THAT HE HATED SLAVERY SO DECIDEDLY AND HAD SUCH A CLEAR COMMON SENSE LIKE VIEW OF THE EVILS AND MISERY OF THE SYSTEM THAT HE DECLARED
