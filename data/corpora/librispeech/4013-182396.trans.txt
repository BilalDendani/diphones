4013-182396-0000 WHY MINER THE MOLE LIVES UNDER GROUND STRIPED CHIPMUNK SAT STARING AT A LITTLE RIDGE WHERE THE GRASS WAS RAISED UP HE HAD OFTEN SEEN LITTLE RIDGES LIKE THAT WITHOUT THINKING MUCH ABOUT THEM HE KNEW THAT THEY WERE MADE BY MINER THE MOLE
4013-182396-0001 BUT NOW AS HE LOOKED AT THIS ONE IT SUDDENLY STRUCK HIM THAT HE HAD NOT SEEN MINER THE MOLE MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE IN ALL HIS LIFE WHAT A QUEER WAY OF LIVING THOUGHT STRIPED CHIPMUNK
4013-182396-0002 IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO HAVE A SNUG HOUSE UNDER THE GROUND WHERE ONE CAN SLEEP THE LONG COLD WINTER AWAY AND BE PERFECTLY SAFE
4013-182396-0003 IN THE BEAUTIFUL SPRINGTIME AND SUMMERTIME AND AUTUMNTIME I CAN'T UNDERSTAND JUST THINK OF ALL THAT MINER MISSES THE SUNSHINE THE FLOWERS THE SONGS OF THE BIRDS AND THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES TO PLAY WITH I WONDER
4013-182396-0004 WHAT DO YOU WONDER THE VOICE WAS SO CLOSE TO STRIPED CHIPMUNK THAT IT MADE HIM JUMP HE WHIRLED ABOUT THERE WAS JOHNNY CHUCK WHO HAD TIPTOED UP AS SOFTLY AS HE KNEW HOW TO GIVE STRIPED CHIPMUNK A SCARE JOHNNY GRINNED
4013-182396-0005 WHAT DO YOU WONDER HE REPEATED STRIPED CHIPMUNK MADE A FACE AT JOHNNY I WONDER SOMETHING THAT I BET YOU DON'T KNOW HE REPLIED THAT'S EASY REPLIED JOHNNY THERE ARE MORE THINGS I DON'T KNOW THAN I DO KNOW
4013-182396-0006 BUT I'M ALWAYS READY TO LEARN WHAT IS IT THIS TIME WHY DOES MINER THE MOLE LIVE UNDER GROUND ALL THE TIME STRIPED CHIPMUNK POINTED TO THE RIDGE MADE BY MINER JOHNNY CHUCK SCRATCHED HIS HEAD THOUGHTFULLY
4013-182396-0007 I DON'T KNOW HE CONFESSED FINALLY I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE OF COURSE THERE MUST BE A REASON HE NEVER COMES OUT TO PLAY WITH THE REST OF US JUST SPENDS ALL HIS TIME BY HIMSELF DOWN IN THE DARK DIGGING AND DIGGING I WONDER
4013-182396-0008 WELL WHAT DO YOU WONDER THE SAME THING YOU WONDER LAUGHED JOHNNY CHUCK IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING ELSE TO DO LET'S GO DOWN TO THE SMILING POOL AND ASK GRANDFATHER FROG HE'LL BE SURE TO KNOW
4013-182396-0009 STRIPED CHIPMUNK HADN'T ANYTHING ELSE TO DO SO OFF THEY STARTED ON THE WAY THEY MET JIMMY SKUNK AND DANNY MEADOW MOUSE NEITHER OF THEM KNEW WHY MINER THE MOLE LIVES UNDER GROUND AND BECAUSE THEY HADN'T ANYTHING BETTER TO DO
4013-182396-0010 THEY ALSO STARTED FOR THE SMILING POOL GRANDFATHER FROG WAS SITTING ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY PAD IN THE WARM SUNSHINE AND FOR ONCE HE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE TEASED FOR A STORY CHUG A RUM SAID HE IN HIS DEEP VOICE
4013-182396-0011 IT'S VERY STRANGE TO ME HOW LITTLE SOME FOLKS KNOW ABOUT THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBORS HE LOOKED UP AND WINKED AT JOLLY ROUND BRIGHT MISTER SUN STRIPED CHIPMUNK JOHNNY CHUCK JIMMY SKUNK AND DANNY MEADOW MOUSE
4013-182396-0012 LOOKED AS THOUGH THEY FELT VERY FOOLISH AS INDEED THEY DID YOU SEE ALL THEIR LIVES MINER THE MOLE HAD BEEN ONE OF THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBORS AND YET THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT HIM IT HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO
4013-182396-0013 CONTINUED GRANDFATHER FROG WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG INTERRUPTED DANNY MEADOW MOUSE OF COURSE REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG PRETENDING TO BE VERY MUCH PUT OUT AT SUCH A FOOLISH QUESTION
4013-182396-0014 IN THOSE DAYS MINER'S GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED DIDN'T LIVE UNDER GROUND CONTINUED GRANDFATHER FROG NOBODY DID HE WASN'T SO VERY DIFFERENT FROM A LOT OF OTHER ANIMALS
4013-182396-0015 FOOD WAS PLENTY AND EVERYBODY WAS ON THE BEST OF TERMS WITH EVERYBODY ELSE MISTER MOLE LIVED JUST AS THE REST DID HE WENT AND CAME AS HE PLEASED AND ENJOYED THE SUNSHINE AND TOOK PART IN ALL THE GOOD TIMES OF HIS NEIGHBORS
4013-182396-0016 EVERYBODY LIKED HIM AND WHENEVER HE MADE A CALL HE WAS SURE OF A WELCOME BUT ONE THING MISTER MOLE NEVER DID HE NEVER MEDDLED IN OTHER PEOPLE'S AFFAIRS NO SIR
4013-182396-0017 MISTER MOLE NEVER POKED HIS NOSE IN WHERE HE HAD NO BUSINESS FOR A LONG TIME EVERYTHING WENT SMOOTHLY WITH ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE GREEN FOREST AND THE GREEN MEADOWS
4013-182396-0018 THEY GREW HARDER AND HARDER FOOD WAS SCARCE AND KEPT GROWING MORE SCARCE EVERYBODY WAS HUNGRY AND YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WITH HUNGRY PEOPLE THEY GROW UGLY AND QUARRELSOME MATTERS GREW WORSE AND WORSE
4013-182396-0019 AND THEN IT WAS THAT FEAR WAS BORN THE BIG PEOPLE LIKE OLD KING BEAR AND MISTER WOLF AND MISTER PANTHER AND MISTER LYNX BEGAN TO LOOK WITH HUNGRY EYES ON THE LITTLE PEOPLE
4013-182396-0020 AND THE LITTLE PEOPLE BEGAN TO GROW AFRAID AND HIDE FROM THE BIG PEOPLE AND ALL THE TIME THEY WERE CONTINUALLY QUARRELING AMONG THEMSELVES AND STEALING FROM EACH OTHER TO GET ENOUGH TO EAT NOW AS I SAID BEFORE
4013-182396-0021 HE WENT OFF BY HIMSELF TO THINK THINGS OVER IT ISN'T SAFE TO RUN AROUND ANY MORE SAID HE I MET MISTER WOLF THIS MORNING AND HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SUCH A HUNGRY LOOK IN HIS EYES THAT IT GAVE ME THE COLD SHIVERS I BELIEVE HE WOULD HAVE
4013-182396-0022 EATEN ME IF I HADN'T CRAWLED INTO AN OLD HOLLOW STUMP NOW I CAN'T RUN FAST BECAUSE MY LEGS ARE TOO SHORT I CAN'T CLIMB TREES LIKE MISTER SQUIRREL AND I CAN'T SWIM LIKE MISTER MUSKRAT THE ONLY THING I CAN DO IS TO DIG
4013-182396-0023 YOU SEE
4013-182396-0024 AND HE HAD DONE SO MUCH OF IT THAT HIS FRONT LEGS AND CLAWS HAD GROWN VERY STOUT NOW IF I DIG A HOLE AND KEEP OUT OF SIGHT I WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MISTER WOLF OR ANYBODY ELSE CONTINUED MISTER MOLE TO HIMSELF
4013-182396-0025 SO HE WENT TO WORK AT ONCE AND DUG A HOLE ON THE GREEN MEADOWS AND BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BE COMFORTABLE HE MADE A BIG HOLE WHEN IT WAS FINISHED HE WAS TIRED SO HE CURLED UP AT THE BOTTOM FOR A NAP
4013-182396-0026 HE WAS AWAKENED BY HEARING VOICES OUTSIDE HE KNEW THOSE VOICES RIGHT AWAY THEY WERE THE VOICES OF MISTER FOX AND MISTER BADGER THESE ARE TERRIBLE TIMES SAID MISTER FOX I'M SO HUNGRY
4013-182396-0027 I WONDER WHO HAS DUG THIS HOLE MISTER MOLE REPLIED MISTER BADGER I SAW HIM AT WORK HERE THIS MORNING HAVE YOU NOTICED HOW VERY PLUMP HE LOOKS YES REPLIED MISTER FOX
4013-182396-0028 HE MADE MY MOUTH WATER THE VERY LAST TIME I SAW HIM SEEMS TO ME I CAN SMELL HIM NOW IF HE HAD MADE THIS HOLE JUST A LITTLE BIT BIGGER I WOULD GO DOWN AND PULL HIM OUT BUT I AM TOO TIRED TO DO ANY DIGGING NOW
4013-182396-0029 I TELL YOU WHAT REPLIED MISTER BADGER WE'LL HUNT TOGETHER A LITTLE LONGER AND THEN IF WE CAN'T FIND ANYTHING TO EAT WE'LL COME BACK AND I'LL HELP YOU DIG I HATE TO HURT MISTER MOLE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS MINDS HIS OWN BUSINESS
4013-182396-0030 OH DEAR OH DEAR WHAT EVER CAN I DO HE LAY THERE FEELING VERY HELPLESS AND MISERABLE
4013-182396-0031 IF HE HAD MADE HIS HOLE SMALL JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO CRAWL INTO MISTER BADGER AND MISTER FOX WOULD HAVE HAD TO DO A GREAT DEAL OF DIGGING TO MAKE IT BIG ENOUGH FOR EITHER OF THEM TO GET IN HE WOULD MAKE A LITTLE TUNNEL OFF ONE SIDE
4013-182396-0032 AND HIDE IN THAT SO HE WENT TO WORK AND MADE A LITTLE TUNNEL OFF ONE SIDE JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SQUEEZE INTO HE WORKED VERY HARD AND VERY FAST AND BY THE TIME MISTER BADGER AND MISTER FOX RETURNED
4013-182396-0033 MISTER MOLE WAS AT THE END OF A LONG TUNNEL SO FAR FROM THE HOLE HE HAD FIRST DUG THAT HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM A LONG TIME TO DIG HIM OUT EVEN IF THEY NOTICED HIS TUNNEL BUT THEY DIDN'T THEY DUG DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF HIS HOLE AND THEN
4013-182396-0034 BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FIND HIM THERE THEY STRAIGHTWAY FELL TO QUARRELING EACH BLAMING THE OTHER FOR SUGGESTING SUCH A LOT OF HARD WORK FOR NOTHING FINALLY THEY WENT AWAY STILL CALLING EACH OTHER NAMES AND FROM THAT DAY TO THIS
4013-182396-0035 MISTER MOLE SPENT ALL HIS TIME IN HIS TUNNELS AND SELDOM PUT HIS NOSE OUTSIDE HE WAS SAFE AND HE WAS COMFORTABLE AND HE COULD ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING TO EAT BY DIGGING FOR IT LITTLE BY LITTLE HIS OLD NEIGHBORS FORGOT ALL ABOUT HIM
4013-182396-0036 BECAUSE HE HAD LITTLE USE FOR THEM HIS EYES GREW SMALLER AND SMALLER AND WHEN HE DID COME UP INTO THE LIGHT THEY HURT HIM SO THAT HE WAS GLAD TO GO BACK INTO THE DARK AGAIN HE WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY AND SATISFIED THERE
4013-182396-0037 AND WHAT IS THERE IN LIFE BETTER THAN TO BE HAPPY AND SATISFIED NOTHING REPLIED STRIPED CHIPMUNK AT WHOM GRANDFATHER FROG HAPPENED TO BE LOOKING WHEN HE ASKED THE QUESTION RIGHT REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG
4013-182396-0038 AND NOW YOU KNOW WHY MINER THE MOLE LIVES UNDER GROUND BECAUSE HE IS PERFECTLY HAPPY AND SATISFIED THERE JUST THEN UP CAME PETER RABBIT ALL OUT OF BREATH HAS GRANDFATHER FROG BEEN TELLING A STORY HE PANTED
