2351-151969-0000 FINE OLD CHRISTMAS WITH THE SNOWY HAIR AND RUDDY FACE HAD DONE HIS DUTY THAT YEAR IN THE NOBLEST FASHION AND HAD SET OFF HIS RICH GIFTS OF WARMTH AND COLOR WITH ALL THE HEIGHTENING CONTRAST OF FROST AND SNOW
2351-151969-0001 IT WEIGHED HEAVILY ON THE LAURELS AND FIR TREES TILL IT FELL FROM THEM WITH A SHUDDERING SOUND IT CLOTHED THE ROUGH TURNIP FIELD WITH WHITENESS AND MADE THE SHEEP LOOK LIKE DARK BLOTCHES
2351-151969-0002 THE GATES WERE ALL BLOCKED UP WITH THE SLOPING DRIFTS AND HERE AND THERE A DISREGARDED FOUR FOOTED BEAST STOOD AS IF PETRIFIED IN UNRECUMBENT SADNESS THERE WAS NO GLEAM NO SHADOW
2351-151969-0003 FOR THE HEAVENS TOO WERE ONE STILL PALE CLOUD NO SOUND OR MOTION IN ANYTHING BUT THE DARK RIVER THAT FLOWED AND MOANED LIKE AN UNRESTING SORROW BUT OLD CHRISTMAS SMILED AS HE LAID THIS CRUEL SEEMING SPELL ON THE OUTDOOR WORLD
2351-151969-0004 FOR HE MEANT TO LIGHT UP HOME WITH NEW BRIGHTNESS TO DEEPEN ALL THE RICHNESS OF INDOOR COLOR AND GIVE A KEENER EDGE OF DELIGHT TO THE WARM FRAGRANCE OF FOOD HE MEANT TO PREPARE A SWEET IMPRISONMENT THAT WOULD STRENGTHEN THE PRIMITIVE FELLOWSHIP OF KINDRED
2351-151969-0005 WITH EVER UNRELENTING UNRELENTING PURPOSE STILL HIDES THAT SECRET IN HIS OWN MIGHTY SLOW BEATING HEART AND YET THIS CHRISTMAS DAY IN SPITE OF TOM'S FRESH DELIGHT IN HOME WAS NOT HE THOUGHT SOMEHOW OR OTHER
2351-151969-0006 QUITE SO HAPPY AS IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN BEFORE THE RED BERRIES WERE JUST AS ABUNDANT ON THE HOLLY AND HE AND MAGGIE HAD DRESSED ALL THE WINDOWS AND MANTLEPIECES AND PICTURE FRAMES ON CHRISTMAS EVE WITH AS MUCH TASTE AS EVER
2351-151969-0007 WHEN THEIR CAROLLING BROKE IN UPON HER DREAMS AND THE IMAGE OF MEN IN FUSTIAN CLOTHES WAS ALWAYS THRUST AWAY BY THE VISION OF ANGELS RESTING ON THE PARTED CLOUD THE MIDNIGHT CHANT
2351-151969-0008 HAD HELPED AS USUAL TO LIFT THE MORNING ABOVE THE LEVEL OF COMMON DAYS AND THEN THERE WERE THE SMELL
2351-151969-0009 FROM THE KITCHEN AT THE BREAKFAST HOUR THE FAVORITE ANTHEM THE GREEN BOUGHS AND THE SHORT SERMON GAVE THE APPROPRIATE FESTAL CHARACTER TO THE CHURCH GOING AND AUNT AND UNCLE MOSS WITH ALL THEIR SEVEN CHILDREN
2351-151969-0010 AS IF IT HAD BEEN HEROICALLY SNATCHED FROM THE NETHER FIRES INTO WHICH IT HAD BEEN THROWN BY DYSPEPTIC PURITANS THE DESSERT WAS AS SPLENDID AS EVER
2351-151969-0011 WITH ITS GOLDEN ORANGES BROWN NUTS AND THE CRYSTALLINE LIGHT AND DARK OF APPLE JELLY AND DAMSON CHEESE IN ALL THESE THINGS CHRISTMAS WAS AS IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN SINCE TOM COULD REMEMBER IT WAS ONLY DISTINGUISHED IF BY ANYTHING
2351-151969-0012 BY SUPERIOR SLIDING AND SNOWBALLS CHRISTMAS WAS CHEERY BUT NOT SO MISTER TULLIVER HE WAS IRATE AND DEFIANT AND TOM THOUGH HE ESPOUSED HIS FATHER'S QUARRELS AND SHARED HIS FATHER'S SENSE OF INJURY
2351-151969-0013 WAS NOT WITHOUT SOME OF THE FEELING THAT OPPRESSED MAGGIE WHEN MISTER TULLIVER GOT LOUDER AND MORE ANGRY IN NARRATION AND ASSERTION WITH THE INCREASED LEISURE OF DESSERT THE ATTENTION THAT TOM MIGHT HAVE CONCENTRATED ON HIS NUTS AND WINE WAS DISTRACTED
2351-151969-0014 AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF GROWN UP LIFE COULD HARDLY BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT A GOOD DEAL OF QUARRELLING NOW TOM WAS NOT FOND OF QUARRELLING UNLESS IT COULD SOON BE PUT AN END TO BY A FAIR STAND UP FIGHT WITH AN ADVERSARY WHOM HE HAD EVERY CHANCE OF THRASHING
2351-151969-0015 AND HIS FATHER'S IRRITABLE TALK MADE HIM UNCOMFORTABLE THOUGH HE NEVER ACCOUNTED TO HIMSELF FOR THE FEELING OR CONCEIVED THE NOTION THAT HIS FATHER WAS FAULTY IN THIS RESPECT
2351-151969-0016 AN INFRINGEMENT ON MISTER TULLIVER'S LEGITIMATE SHARE OF WATER POWER DIX WHO HAD A MILL ON THE STREAM WAS A FEEBLE AUXILIARY OF OLD HARRY COMPARED WITH PIVART DIX HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO HIS SENSES BY ARBITRATION
2351-151969-0017 AND WAKEM'S ADVICE HAD NOT CARRIED HIM FAR NO DIX MISTER TULLIVER CONSIDERED HAD BEEN AS GOOD AS NOWHERE IN POINT OF LAW AND IN THE INTENSITY OF HIS INDIGNATION AGAINST PIVART HIS CONTEMPT FOR A BAFFLED ADVERSARY LIKE DIX
2351-151969-0018 BEGAN TO WEAR THE AIR OF A FRIENDLY ATTACHMENT HE HAD NO MALE AUDIENCE TO DAY EXCEPT MISTER MOSS WHO KNEW NOTHING AS HE SAID
2351-151969-0019 AND COULD ONLY ASSENT TO MISTER TULLIVER'S ARGUMENTS ON THE A PRIORI GROUND OF FAMILY RELATIONSHIP AND MONETARY OBLIGATION BUT MISTER TULLIVER DID NOT TALK WITH THE FUTILE INTENTION OF CONVINCING HIS AUDIENCE
2351-151969-0020 HE TALKED TO RELIEVE HIMSELF WHILE GOOD MISTER MOSS MADE STRONG EFFORTS TO KEEP HIS EYES WIDE OPEN IN SPITE OF THE SLEEPINESS WHICH AN UNUSUALLY GOOD DINNER PRODUCED IN HIS HARD WORKED FRAME MISSUS MOSS MORE ALIVE TO THE SUBJECT
2351-151969-0021 AND INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING THAT AFFECTED HER BROTHER LISTENED AND PUT IN A WORD AS OFTEN AS MATERNAL PREOCCUPATIONS ALLOWED WHY PIVART'S A NEW NAME HEREABOUT BROTHER ISN'T IT SHE SAID
2351-151969-0022 HE DIDN'T OWN THE LAND IN FATHER'S TIME NOR YOURS EITHER BEFORE I WAS MARRIED NEW NAME YES I SHOULD THINK IT IS A NEW NAME SAID MISTER TULLIVER WITH ANGRY EMPHASIS DORLCOTE MILL'S BEEN IN OUR FAMILY A HUNDRED YEAR AND BETTER
2351-151969-0023 I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHALL BE FORCED TO BUT I KNOW WHAT I SHALL FORCE HIM TO WITH HIS DIKES AND ERIGATIONS
2351-151969-0024 HE'S GOT WAKEM TO BACK HIM AND EGG HIM ON I KNOW WAKEM TELLS HIM THE LAW CAN'T TOUCH HIM FOR IT BUT THERE'S FOLKS CAN HANDLE THE LAW BESIDES WAKEM IT TAKES A BIG RASKIL TO BEAT HIM BUT THERE'S BIGGER TO BE FOUND
2351-151969-0025 IF YOU LOOK AT IT STRAIGHT FORRARD FOR A RIVER'S A RIVER AND IF YOU'VE GOT A MILL YOU MUST HAVE WATER TO TURN IT
2351-151969-0026 BUT IF THAT'S THEIR ENGINEERING I'LL PUT TOM TO IT BY AND BY AND HE SHALL SEE IF HE CAN'T FIND A BIT MORE SENSE
2351-151969-0027 INSTANTANEOUSLY EXPRESSED HER SENTIMENTS IN A PIERCING YELL AND WAS NOT TO BE APPEASED EVEN BY THE RESTORATION OF THE RATTLE FEELING APPARENTLY THAT THE ORIGINAL WRONG OF HAVING IT TAKEN FROM HER REMAINED IN ALL ITS FORCE
2351-151969-0028 MISSUS MOSS HURRIED AWAY WITH HER INTO ANOTHER ROOM AND EXPRESSED TO MISSUS TULLIVER WHO ACCOMPANIED HER THE CONVICTION THAT THE DEAR CHILD HAD GOOD REASONS FOR CRYING IMPLYING THAT IF IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE RATTLE THAT BABY CLAMORED FOR
2351-151969-0029 SHE WAS A MISUNDERSTOOD BABY THE THOROUGHLY JUSTIFIABLE YELL BEING QUIETED MISSUS MOSS LOOKED AT HER SISTER IN LAW AND SAID I'M SORRY TO SEE BROTHER SO PUT OUT ABOUT THIS WATER WORK
2351-151969-0030 IT'S YOUR BROTHER'S WAY MISSUS MOSS I'D NEVER ANYTHING O THAT SORT BEFORE I WAS MARRIED SAID MISSUS TULLIVER WITH A HALF IMPLIED REPROACH SHE ALWAYS SPOKE OF HER HUSBAND AS YOUR BROTHER TO MISSUS MOSS
2351-151969-0031 IN ANY CASE WHEN HIS LINE OF CONDUCT WAS NOT MATTER OF PURE ADMIRATION
2351-151969-0032 A DODSON AND A WOMAN BEING ALWAYS ON THE DEFENSIVE TOWARD HER OWN SISTERS IT WAS NATURAL THAT SHE SHOULD BE KEENLY CONSCIOUS OF HER SUPERIORITY EVEN AS THE WEAKEST DODSON OVER A HUSBAND'S SISTER WHO
2351-151969-0033 BESIDES BEING POORLY OFF AND INCLINED TO HANG ON HER BROTHER HAD THE GOOD NATURED SUBMISSIVENESS OF A LARGE EASY TEMPERED UNTIDY PROLIFIC WOMAN WITH AFFECTION ENOUGH IN HER NOT ONLY FOR HER OWN HUSBAND AND ABUNDANT CHILDREN
2351-151969-0034 BUT FOR ANY NUMBER OF COLLATERAL RELATIONS I HOPE AND PRAY HE WON'T GO TO LAW SAID MISSUS MOSS FOR THERE'S NEVER ANY KNOWING WHERE THAT'LL END AND THE RIGHT DOESN'T ALLAYS WIN THIS MISTER PIVART'S A RICH MAN BY WHAT I CAN MAKE OUT
2351-151969-0035 AND THE RICH MOSTLY GET THINGS THEIR OWN WAY AS TO THAT SAID MISSUS TULLIVER STROKING HER DRESS DOWN I'VE SEEN WHAT RICHES ARE IN MY OWN FAMILY FOR MY SISTERS HAVE GOT HUSBANDS AS CAN AFFORD TO DO PRETTY MUCH WHAT THEY LIKE
2351-151969-0036 BUT I THINK SOMETIMES I SHALL BE DROVE OFF MY HEAD
2351-151969-0037 AND MY SISTERS LAY ALL THE FAULT TO ME FOR THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO MARRY A MAN LIKE YOUR BROTHER HOW SHOULD THEY SISTER PULLET HAS HER OWN WAY FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT WELL SAID MISSUS MOSS
2351-151969-0038 I DON'T THINK I SHOULD LIKE MY HUSBAND IF HE HADN'T GOT ANY WITS OF HIS OWN AND I HAD TO FIND HEAD PIECE FOR HIM IT'S A DEAL EASIER TO DO WHAT PLEASES ONE'S HUSBAND THAN TO BE PUZZLING WHAT ELSE ONE SHOULD DO
2351-151969-0039 IF PEOPLE COME TO TALK O DOING WHAT PLEASES THEIR HUSBANDS SAID MISSUS TULLIVER WITH A FAINT IMITATION OF HER SISTER GLEGG I'M SURE YOUR BROTHER MIGHT HAVE WAITED A LONG WHILE BEFORE HE'D HAVE FOUND A WIFE THAT UD HAVE LET HIM HAVE HIS SAY IN EVERYTHING AS I DO
2351-151969-0040 IT'S NOTHING BUT LAW AND ERIGATION NOW FROM WHEN WE FIRST GET UP IN THE MORNING TILL WE GO TO BED AT NIGHT AND I NEVER CONTRADICT HIM I ONLY SAY WELL MISTER TULLIVER DO AS YOU LIKE
2351-151969-0041 WHICH HAS THE CREDIT OR DISCREDIT OF BREAKING THE CAMEL'S BACK THOUGH ON A STRICTLY IMPARTIAL VIEW THE BLAME OUGHT RATHER TO LIE WITH THE PREVIOUS WEIGHT OF FEATHERS WHICH HAD ALREADY PLACED THE BACK IN SUCH IMMINENT PERIL
2351-151969-0042 THAT AN OTHERWISE INNOCENT FEATHER COULD NOT SETTLE ON IT WITHOUT MISCHIEF NOT THAT MISSUS TULLIVER'S FEEBLE BESEECHING COULD HAVE HAD THIS FEATHER'S WEIGHT IN VIRTUE OF HER SINGLE PERSONALITY BUT WHENEVER SHE DEPARTED FROM ENTIRE ASSENT TO HER HUSBAND
2351-151969-0043 HE SAW IN HER THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DODSON FAMILY AND IT WAS A GUIDING PRINCIPLE WITH MISTER TULLIVER TO LET THE DODSONS KNOW THAT THEY WERE NOT TO DOMINEER OVER HIM OR MORE SPECIFICALLY THAT A MALE TULLIVER
2351-151969-0044 WAS FAR MORE THAN EQUAL TO FOUR FEMALE DODSONS EVEN THOUGH ONE OF THEM WAS MISSUS GLEGG BUT NOT EVEN A DIRECT ARGUMENT FROM THAT TYPICAL DODSON FEMALE HERSELF AGAINST HIS GOING TO LAW COULD HAVE HEIGHTENED HIS DISPOSITION
2351-151969-0045 SO MUCH AS THE MERE THOUGHT OF WAKEM CONTINUALLY FRESHENED BY THE SIGHT OF THE TOO ABLE ATTORNEY ON MARKET DAYS
2351-151969-0046 TO HIS CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE WAS METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING AT THE BOTTOM OF PIVART'S IRRIGATION WAKEM HAD TRIED TO MAKE DIX STAND OUT AND GO TO LAW ABOUT THE DAM IT WAS UNQUESTIONABLY WAKEM
2351-151969-0047 ALL LAWYERS WERE MORE OR LESS RASCALS BUT WAKEM'S RASCALITY WAS OF THAT PECULIARLY AGGRAVATED KIND WHICH PLACED ITSELF IN OPPOSITION TO THAT FORM OF RIGHT EMBODIED IN MISTER TULLIVER'S INTERESTS AND OPINIONS
2351-151969-0048 AND AS AN EXTRA TOUCH OF BITTERNESS THE INJURED MILLER HAD RECENTLY IN BORROWING THE FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS BEEN OBLIGED TO CARRY A LITTLE BUSINESS TO WAKEM'S OFFICE ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT A HOOK NOSED GLIB FELLOW
2351-151969-0049 ALWAYS LOOKING SO SURE OF HIS GAME AND IT WAS VEXATIOUS THAT LAWYER GORE WAS NOT MORE LIKE HIM BUT WAS A BALD ROUND FEATURED MAN WITH BLAND MANNERS AND FAT HANDS A GAME COCK
2351-151969-0050 AND CONFIDENT AS MISTER TULLIVER WAS IN HIS PRINCIPLE THAT WATER WAS WATER
2351-151969-0051 HE HAD AN UNCOMFORTABLE SUSPICION THAT WAKEM HAD MORE LAW TO SHOW AGAINST THIS RATIONALLY IRREFRAGABLE INFERENCE THAN GORE COULD SHOW FOR IT BUT THEN
2351-151969-0052 IF THEY WENT TO LAW THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR MISTER TULLIVER TO EMPLOY COUNSELLOR WYLDE ON HIS SIDE INSTEAD OF HAVING THAT ADMIRABLE BULLY AGAINST HIM
2351-151969-0053 MADE TO PERSPIRE AND BECOME CONFOUNDED AS MISTER TULLIVER'S WITNESS HAD ONCE BEEN WAS ALLURING TO THE LOVE OF RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE
2351-151969-0054 ONLY TO BE REACHED THROUGH MUCH HOT ARGUMENT AND ITERATION IN DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL LIFE THAT INITIAL STAGE OF THE DISPUTE WHICH CONSISTED IN THE NARRATION OF THE CASE AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF MISTER TULLIVER'S VIEWS CONCERNING IT
2351-151969-0055 THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CIRCLE OF HIS CONNECTIONS WOULD NECESSARILY TAKE TIME AND AT THE BEGINNING OF FEBRUARY WHEN TOM WAS GOING TO SCHOOL AGAIN
2351-151969-0056 OR ANY MORE SPECIFIC INDICATION OF THE MEASURES HE WAS BENT ON TAKING AGAINST THAT RASH CONTRAVENER OF THE PRINCIPLE
2351-151969-0057 ITERATION LIKE FRICTION IS LIKELY TO GENERATE HEAT INSTEAD OF PROGRESS AND MISTER TULLIVER'S HEAT
2351-151969-0058 IF THERE HAD BEEN NO NEW EVIDENCE ON ANY OTHER POINT
2351-151969-0059 WAS AS THICK AS MUD WITH WAKEM FATHER SAID TOM ONE EVENING NEAR THE END OF THE HOLIDAYS UNCLE GLEGG SAYS LAWYER WAKEM IS GOING TO SEND HIS SON TO MISTER STELLING IT ISN'T TRUE WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT HIS GOING TO BE SENT TO FRANCE
2351-151969-0060 YOU WON'T LIKE ME TO GO TO SCHOOL WITH WAKEM'S SON SHALL YOU IT'S NO MATTER FOR THAT MY BOY SAID MISTER TULLIVER DON'T YOU LEARN ANYTHING BAD OF HIM THAT'S ALL THE LAD'S A POOR DEFORMED CREATUR AND TAKES AFTER HIS MOTHER IN THE FACE
