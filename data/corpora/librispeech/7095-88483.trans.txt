7095-88483-0000 THE PERSISTENCE OF RELIGION WE BELIEVE WHAT WE BELIEVE NOT BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN CONVINCED BY SUCH AND SUCH ARGUMENTS BUT BECAUSE WE ARE OF SUCH AND SUCH A DISPOSITION C E M JOAD
7095-88483-0001 GENERATIONS FOLLOWED AND WHAT HAD BEEN OFFERED AS HYPOTHETICAL THEOLOGICAL SUPPOSITIONS WERE THROUGH CUSTOM AND TRADITION TAKEN FOR GRANTED AS UNQUESTIONED TRUTH LLEWELYN POWYS
7095-88483-0002 THE THEOLOGIANS POINT TO THIS AS A PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF A SUPREME BEING AN INVESTIGATION OF THIS ASSERTION LEADS THE MARTIAN TO THE CONCLUSION THAT RELIGIONS HAVE CONTINUED TO EXIST MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE POWER
7095-88483-0003 WHICH INHERITED SUPERSTITIONS WIELD OVER MANKIND MEN ARE BORN WITH A MARKED TENDENCY TOWARDS SUPERSTITIONS CERTAIN ISOLATED FAMILIES OF MEN ARE BORN WITH AN INHERITED TENDENCY TOWARDS TUBERCULOSIS
7095-88483-0004 MOST OF THESE ARE BORN NOT WITH AN ACTIVE TUBERCULOSIS BUT SOME AS YET IMPERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD TENDENCY A DEFECT IN THEIR PROTOPLASMIC MAKE UP THAT RENDERS THEM AN EASY PREY TO THE TUBERCLE BACILLUS
7095-88483-0005 IN SUPERSTITION CREED RELIGION THE GOD IDEA IT WAS KARL MARX WHO REMARKED THAT THE TRADITION OF ALL THE GENERATIONS OF THE PAST WEIGHS DOWN LIKE AN ALP UPON THE BRAIN OF THE LIVING
7095-88483-0006 SINCE THE DAYS OF OUR RACIAL CHILDHOOD OUR BELIEFS HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION AND THEY HAVE PERSISTED SINCE IN ALL AGES IT WAS FORBIDDEN TO QUESTION THEIR EXISTENCE MAN HAS PERSUADED HIMSELF THAT IT IS SO
7095-88483-0007 JUST BECAUSE HE HAS SAID IT FOR SO LONG AND SO OFTEN THE FORCE OF REPETITION IS GREAT IT IS IN FACT TAKEN BY A VAST MAJORITY OF MEN AS THE EQUIVALENT OF PROOF MOST MEN HAVE TO ACCEPT THEIR RELIGIONS READY MADE
7095-88483-0008 THE TOIL FOR BREAD IS INCESSANT THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT LEISURE TO VERIFY THE SOURCES OF THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS MOREOVER THE ECCLESIASTIC'S ANSWERS TO THE RIDDLES OF LIFE ARE EASIER BY FAR TO GRASP
7095-88483-0009 THAN THE ANSWERS OF SCIENCE THESE TWO FACTORS OF INNATE MENTAL INERTIA AND FORCE OF REPETITION ARE WELL MANIFESTED BY THE PRESENT TACTICS OF ADVERTISING
7095-88483-0010 THE MANUFACTURER OF ANY PRODUCT WELL KNOWS THAT CONSTANT REPETITION AND THE DANGLING OF HIS PRODUCT BEFORE THE EYES OF THE PUBLIC WILL LEAD TO A WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE OF THE ADVERTISING SLOGANS PROPOUNDED FOR HIS ARTICLE
7095-88483-0011 THE FORCE OF SO CALLED AUTHORITY HAS AGGRAVATED THIS MENTAL INERTIA IT TAKES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WILL POWER AND MENTAL COURAGE FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL TO ASSERT AN OPINION THAT RUNS COUNTER TO THE ACCEPTED MODE OF THINKING
7095-88483-0012 IT IS MUCH EASIER AND MUCH MORE PLEASANT TO GIVE ONESELF PASSIVELY TO THAT DELUSION OF GRANDEUR THAT DELUSION THAT PLEASANTLY DRUGS THE MIND WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE IS A SUPREME BEING WHO IS PERSONALLY INTERESTED IN OUR WELL BEING
7095-88483-0013 A PROVIDENCE WHO LIKE A SCHOOL MASTER AT HIS PLEASURE DISPENSES REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AS IMMORTALITY HEAVEN AND HELL SO FIRMLY HAS THIS BECOME ENTRENCHED IN THE MINDS OF MEN
7095-88483-0014 THAT THE IRRATIONALITIES WHICH MANIFEST THEMSELVES AGAINST SUCH A CONCEPTION MAKE NO IMPRESSION SCHOPENHAUER WELL STATES NOTHING IS MORE PROVOKING WHEN WE ARE ARGUING AGAINST A MAN WITH REASONS AND EXPLANATIONS
7095-88483-0015 THAT THE LITTLE GOOD WHICH RELIGION HAD ACCOMPLISHED HAD OCCURRED AT THE TIME WHEN OUR RACE WAS IN ITS INFANCY JUST AS FEAR IS INSTILLED INTO THE MIND OF THE CHILD TO PROTECT IT FROM THE DANGERS OF ITS ENVIRONMENT
7095-88483-0016 REPLACES THOSE FEARS BY A LOGICAL COMPREHENSION OF THE LAWS GOVERNING HIS ENVIRONMENT BUT IN RELIGIOUS MATTERS THIS FEAR HAS CLUNG TO MAN TENACIOUSLY AND WHILE AT FIRST SERVING A PROTECTIVE FUNCTION
7095-88483-0017 AT THE PRESENT STAGE OF CIVILIZATION CONSTITUTES AN EMBRYONIC IMPEDIMENT THE ASSERTION OF ECCLESIASTICS THAT WITHOUT THE AID OF RELIGIOUS LEARNING AND INFLUENCE OUR CIVILIZATION WOULD HAVE BEEN RETARDED IS A STATEMENT
7095-88483-0018 THAT A STUDY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAN SHOWS TO BE DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO THE FACTS THAT RELIGION HAS BEEN THE GREATEST IMPEDIMENT IN THE ROAD TO PROGRESS THIS WILL BE SHOWN IN THE SUBSEQUENT CHAPTERS
7095-88483-0019 THAT DURING THE MIDDLE AGES THE PRIESTS AND MONKS KEPT UP THE TORCH OF LEARNING THAT BEING THE ONLY LITERATE PEOPLE THEY BROUGHT BACK THE STUDY OF THE CLASSICS HISTORICALLY SPEAKING THIS IS ABOUT THE MOST IMPUDENT STATEMENT THAT ONE COULD IMAGINE
7095-88483-0020 LATER LEARNED TO READ AND WRITE FROM THE ARABS JEWS AND GREEKS EXILED FROM CONSTANTINOPLE AFTER FOURTEEN FIFTY THREE IT IS BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO KEEP THE POWER IN THEIR HANDS THE PEOPLE THEY DID NOT PERMIT TO LEARN EITHER TO READ OR WRITE
7095-88483-0021 EVEN THE READING OF THE BIBLE BEAR IN MIND WAS CONSIDERED A CRIME WE ARE TOLD THAT THE PRIESTS AND MONKS BUILT HOSPITALS AND GAVE ALMS TO THE POOR HAVING GOTTEN ENORMOUS TRACTS OF THE BEST LAND INTO THEIR HANDS
7095-88483-0022 SO THAT THE PEOPLE WERE STARVING THEY WERE WILLING TO THROW A BONE OCCASIONALLY TO THE LATTER IT COST THEM NOTHING AND IT GAVE THEM A REPUTATION FOR CHARITY THEY BUILT ENORMOUS MONASTERIES WITH WELL FILLED CELLARS AND LIVED ON THE FAT OF THE LAND
7095-88483-0023 WHILE THE PEOPLE LIVED IN WRETCHED HOVELS WORKING THEIR LIVES AWAY FOR A CRUST OF BREAD THE BEASTS THE DOMESTIC ANIMALS LIVED A MORE COMFORTABLE LIFE THAN DID THE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN OF THE PEOPLE
7095-88483-0024 AND THE CHURCH NEVER NEVER RAISED A FINGER TO AMELIORATE THEIR CONDITION IT KEPT THEM IN SUPERSTITIOUS DARKNESS AND HELPED THE TEMPORAL LORDS FOR A LONG PERIOD THE SPIRITUAL WERE ALSO THE TEMPORAL LORDS
7095-88483-0025 AND WHAT HAD BEEN DONE BY SCIENCE AND PURELY SECULAR KNOWLEDGE IN ITS BRIEF PERIOD OF ACTIVITY THE PERIOD WHEN SCIENCE AND SECULAR KNOWLEDGE HAD PARTIALLY LIBERATED THEMSELVES FROM ECCLESIASTICAL DOMINATION
