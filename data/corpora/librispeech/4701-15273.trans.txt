4701-15273-0000 THERE HAD GROWN UP BETWEEN QUEEN ISABEL OF BAVARIA AND LOUIS DUKE OF ORLEANS BROTHER OF THE KING AN INTIMACY WHICH THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND AMONGST ALL HONORABLE PEOPLE SHOCKED EVEN THE LEAST STRAIT LACED
4701-15273-0001 IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THROUGH THE QUEEN'S INFLUENCE
4701-15273-0002 SUDDENLY DECIDED UPON PUTTING INTO THE HANDS OF THE DUKE OF ORLEANS
4701-15273-0003 THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY WROTE AT ONCE ABOUT IT TO THE PARLIAMENT OF PARIS SAYING TAKE COUNSEL AND PAINS THAT THE INTERESTS OF THE KING AND HIS DOMINION BE NOT GOVERNED AS THEY NOW ARE
4701-15273-0004 FOR IN GOOD TRUTH IT IS A PITY AND A GRIEF TO HEAR WHAT IS TOLD ME ABOUT IT THE ACCUSATION WAS NOT GROUNDED SOLELY UPON THE PERSONAL ILL TEMPER OF THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY HIS NEPHEW THE DUKE OF ORLEANS WAS ELEGANT AFFABLE
4701-15273-0005 VOLATILE GOOD NATURED HE HAD FOR HIS PARTISANS AT COURT ALL THOSE WHO SHARED HIS WORSE THAN FRIVOLOUS TASTES AND HABITS AND HIS POLITICAL JUDGMENT WAS NO BETTER THAN HIS HABITS NO SOONER WAS HE INVESTED WITH POWER
4701-15273-0006 THAN HE ABUSED IT STRANGELY HE LEVIED UPON THE CLERGY AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE AN ENORMOUS TALLIAGE
4701-15273-0007 AND WENT AND SAT DOWN RIGHT OPPOSITE THE PREACHER YES SIR CONTINUED THE MONK THE KING YOUR FATHER DURING HIS REIGN DID LIKEWISE LAY TAXES UPON THE PEOPLE BUT WITH THE PRODUCE OF THEM
4701-15273-0008 HE BUILT FORTRESSES FOR THE DEFENCE OF THE KINGDOM HE HURLED BACK THE ENEMY AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THEIR TOWNS AND HE EFFECTED A SAVING OF TREASURE
4701-15273-0009 BUT NOW THERE IS NOTHING OF THIS KIND DONE THE HEIGHT OF NOBILITY IN THE PRESENT DAY IS TO FREQUENT BAGNIOS TO LIVE IN DEBAUCHERY TO WEAR RICH DRESSES WITH PRETTY FRINGES AND BIG CUFFS THIS O QUEEN HE ADDED
4701-15273-0010 IS WHAT IS SAID TO THE SHAME OF THE COURT AND IF YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE ME
4701-15273-0011 AND YOU WILL HEAR IT TALKED OF BY PLENTY OF PEOPLE
4701-15273-0012 EITHER FROM PURE FEEBLENESS OR BECAUSE HE WAS STRUCK BY THOSE TRUTHS SO BOLDLY PROCLAIMED YIELDED TO THE COUNSELS OF CERTAIN WISE MEN WHO REPRESENTED TO HIM THAT IT WAS NEITHER A REASONABLE
4701-15273-0013 TO INTRUST THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REALM TO A PRINCE WHOSE YOUTH NEEDED RATHER TO BE GOVERNED THAN TO GOVERN HE WITHDREW THE DIRECTION OF AFFAIRS FROM THE DUKE OF ORLEANS AND RESTORED IT TO THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY
4701-15273-0014 WHO TOOK IT AGAIN AND HELD IT WITH A STRONG GRASP AND DID NOT SUFFER HIS NEPHEW LOUIS TO MEDDLE IN ANYTHING BUT FROM THAT TIME FORWARD OPEN DISTRUST AND HATRED WERE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE TWO PRINCES AND THEIR FAMILIES
4701-15273-0015 IN THE VERY MIDST OF THIS COURT CRISIS DUKE PHILIP THE BOLD FELL ILL AND DIED WITHIN A FEW DAYS ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF APRIL FOURTEEN O FOUR HE WAS A PRINCE VALIANT AND ABLE AMBITIOUS IMPERIOUS
4701-15273-0016 EAGER IN THE PURSUIT OF HIS OWN PERSONAL INTERESTS CAREFUL IN HUMORING THOSE WHOM HE ASPIRED TO RULE AND DISPOSED TO DO THEM GOOD SERVICE IN WHATEVER WAS NOT OPPOSED TO HIS OWN ENDS HE DESERVED AND POSSESSED THE CONFIDENCE AND AFFECTION
4701-15273-0017 NOT ONLY OF HIS FATHER KING JOHN
4701-15273-0018 HE FOUNDED THAT GREAT HOUSE OF BURGUNDY WHICH WAS FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY TO ECLIPSE AND OFTEN TO DEPLORABLY COMPROMISE FRANCE BUT PHILIP THE BOLD LOVED FRANCE SINCERELY AND ALWAYS GAVE HER THE CHIEF PLACE IN HIS POLICY
4701-15273-0019 HIS PRIVATE LIFE WAS REGULAR AND STAID AMIDST THE SCANDALOUS LICENTIOUSNESS OF HIS COURT HE WAS OF THOSE WHO LEAVE BEHIND THEM UNFEIGNED REGRET AND AN HONORED MEMORY
4701-15273-0020 WITHOUT HAVING INSPIRED THEIR CONTEMPORARIES WITH ANY LIVELY SYMPATHY JOHN THE FEARLESS COUNT OF NEVERS HIS SON AND SUCCESSOR IN THE DUKEDOM OF BURGUNDY WAS NOT SLOW TO PROVE THAT THERE WAS REASON TO REGRET HIS FATHER
4701-15273-0021 HIS EXPEDITION TO HUNGARY FOR ALL ITS BAD LEADERSHIP AND BAD FORTUNE HAD CREATED ESTEEM FOR HIS COURAGE AND FOR HIS FIRMNESS UNDER REVERSES BUT LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN HIS DIRECTION OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS HE WAS A MAN OF VIOLENCE
4701-15273-0022 UNSCRUPULOUS AND INDISCREET FULL OF JEALOUSY AND HATRED AND CAPABLE OF ANY DEED AND ANY RISK FOR THE GRATIFICATION OF HIS PASSIONS OR HIS FANCIES AT HIS ACCESSION HE MADE SOME POPULAR MOVES
4701-15273-0023 HE APPEARED DISPOSED TO PROSECUTE VIGOROUSLY THE WAR AGAINST ENGLAND WHICH WAS GOING ON SLUGGISHLY HE TESTIFIED A CERTAIN SPIRIT OF CONCILIATION BY GOING TO PAY A VISIT TO HIS COUSIN THE DUKE OF ORLEANS
