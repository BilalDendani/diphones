720-173580-0000 A GAUDY TASTE FOR THEY ARE LITTLE SKILL'D IN THE ARTS OF WHICH THESE LANDS WERE ONCE THE FONT
720-173580-0001 OR A PRETTY OPERA SCENE AND NEARER AS THEY CAME
720-173580-0002 HIS FRIEND TOO ADDING A NEW SAVING CLAUSE SAID IN HEAVEN'S NAME LET'S GET SOME SUPPER NOW
720-173580-0003 SOME TALK OF AN APPEAL UNTO SOME PASSION SOME TO MEN'S FEELINGS OTHERS TO THEIR REASON THE LAST OF THESE WAS NEVER MUCH THE FASHION FOR REASON THINKS ALL REASONING OUT OF SEASON
720-173580-0004 SOME SPEAKERS WHINE AND OTHERS LAY THE LASH ON BUT MORE OR LESS CONTINUE STILL TO TEASE ON WITH ARGUMENTS ACCORDING TO THEIR FORTE
720-173580-0005 BUT I DIGRESS OF ALL APPEALS ALTHOUGH I GRANT THE POWER OF PATHOS AND OF GOLD OF BEAUTY FLATTERY THREATS A SHILLING
720-173580-0006 NO METHOD S MORE SURE AT MOMENTS TO TAKE HOLD OF THE BEST FEELINGS OF MANKIND
720-173580-0007 OVERPOWERING KNELL THE TOCSIN OF THE SOUL THE DINNER BELL TURKEY CONTAINS NO BELLS AND YET MEN DINE
720-173580-0008 AND GAZED AROUND THEM TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT WITH THE PROPHETIC EYE OF APPETITE
720-173580-0009 OF OTTOMAN PARADE I WON'T DESCRIBE
720-173580-0010 DESCRIPTION IS MY FORTE BUT EVERY FOOL DESCRIBES IN THESE BRIGHT DAYS HIS WONDROUS JOURNEY TO SOME FOREIGN COURT AND SPAWNS HIS QUARTO AND DEMANDS YOUR PRAISE DEATH TO HIS PUBLISHER TO HIM T IS SPORT
720-173580-0011 OTHERS IN MONOSYLLABLE TALK CHATTED AND SOME SEEM'D MUCH IN LOVE WITH THEIR OWN DRESS AND DIVERS SMOKED SUPERB PIPES DECORATED WITH AMBER MOUTHS OF GREATER PRICE OR LESS AND SEVERAL STRUTTED
720-173580-0012 OTHERS SLEPT AND SOME PREPARED FOR SUPPER WITH A GLASS OF RUM AS THE BLACK EUNUCH ENTER'D WITH HIS BRACE OF PURCHASED INFIDELS SOME RAISED THEIR EYES A MOMENT WITHOUT SLACKENING FROM THEIR PACE
720-173580-0013 BUT THOSE WHO SATE NE'ER STIRR'D IN ANYWISE ONE OR TWO STARED THE CAPTIVES IN THE FACE JUST AS ONE VIEWS A HORSE TO GUESS HIS PRICE SOME NODDED TO THE NEGRO FROM THEIR STATION BUT
720-173580-0014 NO ONE TROUBLED HIM WITH CONVERSATION HE LEADS THEM THROUGH THE HALL AND WITHOUT STOPPING ON THROUGH A FARTHER RANGE OF GOODLY ROOMS SPLENDID BUT SILENT
720-173580-0015 SAVE IN ONE WHERE DROPPING A MARBLE FOUNTAIN ECHOES THROUGH THE GLOOMS OF NIGHT WHICH ROBE THE CHAMBER OR WHERE POPPING SOME FEMALE HEAD MOST CURIOUSLY PRESUMES TO THRUST ITS BLACK EYES THROUGH THE DOOR OR LATTICE
720-173580-0016 SOME FAINT LAMPS GLEAMING FROM THE LOFTY WALLS GAVE LIGHT ENOUGH TO HINT THEIR FARTHER WAY BUT NOT ENOUGH TO SHOW THE IMPERIAL HALLS IN ALL THE FLASHING OF THEIR FULL ARRAY
720-173580-0017 APPALS BUT SADDENS MORE BY NIGHT AS WELL AS DAY THAN AN ENORMOUS ROOM WITHOUT A SOUL TO BREAK THE LIFELESS SPLENDOUR OF THE WHOLE TWO OR THREE SEEM SO LITTLE
720-173580-0018 ONE SEEMS NOTHING IN DESERTS FORESTS CROWDS OR BY THE SHORE THERE SOLITUDE WE KNOW HAS HER FULL GROWTH IN THE SPOTS WHICH WERE HER REALMS FOR EVERMORE BUT IN A MIGHTY HALL OR GALLERY
720-173580-0019 A NEAT SNUG STUDY ON A WINTER'S NIGHT
720-173580-0020 I PASS MY EVENINGS IN LONG GALLERIES SOLELY AND THAT S THE REASON I M SO MELANCHOLY ALAS MAN MAKES THAT GREAT WHICH MAKES HIM LITTLE
720-173580-0021 BUT HUGE HOUSES FIT ILL AND HUGE TOMBS WORSE MANKIND SINCE ADAM FELL METHINKS THE STORY OF THE TOWER OF BABEL MIGHT TEACH THEM THIS MUCH BETTER THAN I M ABLE BABEL WAS NIMROD'S HUNTING BOX
720-173580-0022 KING OF MEN REIGN'D TILL ONE SUMMER'S DAY HE TOOK TO GRAZING AND DANIEL TAMED THE LIONS IN THEIR DEN THE PEOPLE'S AWE AND ADMIRATION RAISING
720-173580-0023 AND THE CALUMNIATED QUEEN SEMIRAMIS THAT INJURED QUEEN BY CHRONICLERS SO COARSE HAS BEEN ACCUSED I DOUBT NOT BY CONSPIRACY OF AN IMPROPER FRIENDSHIP FOR HER HORSE
720-173580-0024 LOVE LIKE RELIGION SOMETIMES RUNS TO HERESY THIS MONSTROUS TALE HAD PROBABLY ITS SOURCE FOR SUCH EXAGGERATIONS HERE AND THERE I SEE IN WRITING COURSER BY MISTAKE FOR COURIER
720-173580-0025 I WISH THE CASE COULD COME BEFORE A JURY HERE BUT TO RESUME SHOULD THERE BE WHAT MAY NOT BE IN THESE DAYS SOME INFIDELS WHO DON'T BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND OUT THE VERY SPOT OF THAT SAME BABEL
720-173580-0026 OR BECAUSE THEY WON'T THOUGH CLAUDIUS RICH ESQUIRE SOME BRICKS HAS GOT AND WRITTEN LATELY TWO MEMOIRS UPON'T BELIEVE THE JEWS
720-173580-0027 THOUGH THEY BELIEVE NOT YOU YET LET THEM THINK THAT HORACE HAS EXPREST SHORTLY AND SWEETLY THE MASONIC FOLLY OF THOSE FORGETTING THE GREAT PLACE OF REST WHO GIVE THEMSELVES TO ARCHITECTURE WHOLLY
720-173580-0028 WE KNOW WHERE THINGS AND MEN MUST END AT BEST A MORAL LIKE ALL MORALS MELANCHOLY
720-173580-0029 AT LAST THEY REACH'D A QUARTER MOST RETIRED WHERE ECHO WOKE AS IF FROM A LONG SLUMBER
720-173580-0030 THOUGH FULL OF ALL THINGS WHICH COULD BE DESIRED ONE WONDER'D WHAT TO DO WITH SUCH A NUMBER OF ARTICLES WHICH NOBODY REQUIRED HERE WEALTH HAD DONE ITS UTMOST TO ENCUMBER WITH FURNITURE AN EXQUISITE APARTMENT
720-173580-0031 WHICH PUZZLED NATURE MUCH TO KNOW WHAT ART MEANT IT SEEM'D HOWEVER BUT TO OPEN ON A RANGE OR SUITE OF FURTHER CHAMBERS WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO HEAVEN KNOWS WHERE BUT IN THIS ONE THE MOVABLES WERE PRODIGALLY RICH
720-173580-0032 THE BLACK HOWEVER WITHOUT HARDLY DEIGNING A GLANCE AT THAT WHICH WRAPT THE SLAVES IN WONDER TRAMPLED WHAT THEY SCARCE TROD FOR FEAR OF STAINING AS IF THE MILKY WAY THEIR FEET WAS UNDER WITH ALL ITS STARS
720-173580-0033 AND WITH A STRETCH ATTAINING A CERTAIN PRESS OR CUPBOARD NICHED IN YONDER IN THAT REMOTE RECESS WHICH YOU MAY SEE OR IF YOU DON'T THE FAULT IS NOT IN ME I WISH TO BE PERSPICUOUS AND THE BLACK I SAY UNLOCKING THE RECESS
720-173580-0034 PULL'D FORTH A QUANTITY OF CLOTHES FIT FOR THE BACK OF ANY MUSSULMAN WHATE'ER HIS WORTH AND OF VARIETY THERE WAS NO LACK AND YET THOUGH I HAVE SAID THERE WAS NO DEARTH
720-173580-0035 HE CHOSE HIMSELF TO POINT OUT WHAT HE THOUGHT MOST PROPER FOR THE CHRISTIANS HE HAD BOUGHT THE SUIT HE THOUGHT MOST SUITABLE TO EACH WAS FOR THE ELDER AND THE STOUTER FIRST A CANDIOTE CLOAK
720-173580-0036 WHICH TO THE KNEE MIGHT REACH AND TROUSERS NOT SO TIGHT THAT THEY WOULD BURST BUT SUCH AS FIT AN ASIATIC BREECH A SHAWL WHOSE FOLDS IN CASHMIRE HAD BEEN NURST SLIPPERS OF SAFFRON DAGGER RICH AND HANDY IN SHORT
720-173580-0037 ALL THINGS WHICH FORM A TURKISH DANDY WHILE HE WAS DRESSING BABA THEIR BLACK FRIEND HINTED THE VAST ADVANTAGES WHICH THEY MIGHT PROBABLY ATTAIN BOTH IN THE END IF THEY WOULD BUT PURSUE THE PROPER WAY WHICH FORTUNE PLAINLY SEEM'D TO RECOMMEND
720-173580-0038 IF THEY WOULD CONDESCEND TO CIRCUMCISION FOR HIS OWN PART HE REALLY SHOULD REJOICE TO SEE THEM TRUE BELIEVERS BUT NO LESS WOULD LEAVE HIS PROPOSITION TO THEIR CHOICE
720-173580-0039 THE OTHER THANKING HIM FOR THIS EXCESS OF GOODNESS IN THUS LEAVING THEM A VOICE IN SUCH A TRIFLE SCARCELY COULD EXPRESS SUFFICIENTLY HE SAID HIS APPROBATION OF ALL THE CUSTOMS OF THIS POLISH'D NATION
720-173580-0040 FOR HIS OWN SHARE HE SAW BUT SMALL OBJECTION TO SO RESPECTABLE AN ANCIENT RITE AND AFTER SWALLOWING DOWN A SLIGHT REFECTION FOR WHICH HE OWN'D A PRESENT APPETITE
720-173580-0041 HE DOUBTED NOT A FEW HOURS OF REFLECTION WOULD RECONCILE HIM TO THE BUSINESS QUITE WILL IT
720-173580-0042 STRIKE ME DEAD BUT THEY AS SOON SHALL CIRCUMCISE MY HEAD CUT OFF A THOUSAND HEADS BEFORE
720-173580-0043 PROVIDED ALWAYS YOUR GREAT GOODNESS STILL REMITS THE MATTER TO OUR OWN FREE WILL
720-173580-0044 BE SO GOOD AS DRESS YOURSELF AND POINTED OUT A SUIT IN WHICH A PRINCESS WITH GREAT PLEASURE WOULD ARRAY HER LIMBS
720-173580-0045 GAVE IT A SLIGHT KICK WITH HIS CHRISTIAN FOOT AND WHEN THE OLD NEGRO TOLD HIM TO GET READY REPLIED OLD GENTLEMAN I M NOT A LADY
720-173580-0046 I NEITHER KNOW NOR CARE SAID BABA BUT PRAY DO AS I DESIRE I HAVE NO MORE TIME NOR MANY WORDS TO SPARE AT LEAST
720-173580-0047 I HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO TELL THE REASON
720-173580-0048 REJOIN'D THE NEGRO PRAY BE NOT PROVOKING
720-173580-0049 AND YOU WILL FIND US NOT TOP FOND OF JOKING
720-173580-0050 BUT BABA STROKING THE THINGS DOWN SAID
720-173580-0051 I OFFER YOU A HANDSOME SUIT OF CLOTHES
720-173580-0052 THOUGH MY SOUL LOATHES THE EFFEMINATE GARB
720-173580-0053 WHAT THE DEVIL SHALL I DO WITH ALL THIS GAUZE THUS HE PROFANELY TERM'D THE FINEST LACE WHICH E'ER SET OFF A MARRIAGE MORNING FACE
