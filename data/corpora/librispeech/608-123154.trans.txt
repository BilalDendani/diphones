608-123154-0000 DID YOU EVER HAVE SUCH A THRILL IN THE WHOLE OF YOUR LIFE BARRING ONE OR TWO CONNECTED WITH JERVIS
608-123154-0001 NOTHING IN MY FOUR TRIPS TO EUROPE EVER THRILLED ME LIKE THE QUEER SIGHTS AND TASTES AND SMELLS OF THOSE THREE WARM WEEKS SEVEN YEARS AGO AND EVER SINCE I'VE PANTED TO GET BACK WHEN I STOP TO THINK ABOUT IT
608-123154-0002 ISN'T IT FUNNY YOU'D THINK I MUST HAVE A DASH OF CREOLE OR SPANISH OR SOME WARM BLOOD IN ME SOMEWHERE BUT I'M NOTHING ON EARTH BUT A CHILLY MIXTURE OF ENGLISH AND IRISH AND SCOTCH
608-123154-0003 THE PALM DREAMS OF THE PINE AND THE PINE OF THE PALM AFTER SEEING YOU OFF I TURNED BACK TO NEW YORK WITH AN AWFUL WANDER THIRST GNAWING AT MY VITALS I TOO WANTED TO BE STARTING OFF ON MY TRAVELS IN A NEW BLUE HAT
608-123154-0004 I SUPPOSE YOU ARE THINKING THEY ARE NOT ENTIRELY INCOMPATIBLE GORDON AND THE WIDE WORLD
608-123154-0005 A GOOD SENSIBLE WORKADAY INSTITUTION BUT AWFULLY CURBING TO ONE'S LIBERTY SOMEHOW AFTER YOU'RE MARRIED FOREVER LIFE HAS LOST ITS FEELING OF ADVENTURE THERE AREN'T ANY ROMANTIC POSSIBILITIES WAITING TO SURPRISE YOU AROUND EACH CORNER
608-123154-0006 THE DISGRACEFUL TRUTH IS THAT
608-123154-0007 IT SEEMS A TERRIBLE TASK TO TELL YOU MY TROUBLES IN TONES THAT WILL REACH TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CONTINENT
608-123154-0008 AND I COULD SEE YOU AND JERVIS PLAINLY LEANING ON THE RAIL I WAVED FRANTICALLY BUT YOU NEVER BLINKED AN EYELASH YOUR GAZE WAS FIXED IN HOMESICK CONTEMPLATION UPON THE TOP OF THE WOOLWORTH BUILDING
608-123154-0009 AS I WAS ENTERING THROUGH THEIR REVOLVING DOORS
608-123154-0010 I THOUGHT WE SHOULD REVOLVE ETERNALLY BUT WE FINALLY GOT TOGETHER AND SHOOK HANDS AND SHE OBLIGINGLY HELPED ME CHOOSE FIFTEEN DOZEN PAIRS OF STOCKINGS AND FIFTY CAPS AND SWEATERS AND TWO HUNDRED UNION SUITS AND THEN WE GOSSIPED ALL THE WAY UP TO FIFTY SECOND STREET WHERE WE HAD LUNCHEON AT THE WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY CLUB
608-123154-0011 SHE'S NOT SPECTACULAR BUT STEADY AND DEPENDABLE
608-123154-0012 FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO SAID I
608-123154-0013 HAS SHE A NICE HUSBAND
608-123154-0014 NEVER SAW A HAPPIER MARRIAGE IT STRUCK ME THAT HELEN LOOKED A TRIFLE BLEAK AND I SUDDENLY REMEMBERED ALL THAT GOSSIP THAT MARTY KEENE TOLD US LAST SUMMER SO I HASTILY CHANGED THE CONVERSATION TO A PERFECTLY SAFE SUBJECT LIKE ORPHANS
608-123154-0015 HAS HAD A BABY AND LOST HIM DIVORCED HER HUSBAND QUARRELED WITH HER FAMILY AND COME TO THE CITY TO EARN HER OWN LIVING SHE IS READING MANUSCRIPT FOR A PUBLISHING HOUSE
608-123154-0016 THE MARRIAGE JUST SIMPLY DIDN'T WORK THEY WEREN'T FRIENDS
608-123154-0017 GLAD TO SEE YOU HOW ARE YOU AND GONE ON AND YET THEY MARRIED ISN'T IT DREADFUL HOW BLIND THIS SEX BUSINESS CAN MAKE PEOPLE SHE WAS BROUGHT UP ON THE THEORY THAT A WOMAN'S ONLY LEGITIMATE PROFESSION IS HOMEMAKING WHEN SHE FINISHED COLLEGE SHE WAS NATURALLY EAGER TO START ON HER CAREER
608-123154-0018 AND HENRY PRESENTED HIMSELF HER FAMILY SCANNED HIM CLOSELY AND FOUND HIM PERFECT IN EVERY RESPECT GOOD FAMILY GOOD MORALS GOOD FINANCIAL POSITION GOOD LOOKING HELEN WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM
608-123154-0019 BUT AS THEY BEGAN TO GET ACQUAINTED THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE SAME BOOKS OR JOKES OR PEOPLE OR AMUSEMENTS HE WAS EXPANSIVE AND SOCIAL AND HILARIOUS AND SHE WASN'T
608-123154-0020 HER ORDERLINESS MADE HIM IMPATIENT AND HIS DISORDERLINESS DROVE HER WILD SHE WOULD SPEND A DAY GETTING CLOSETS AND BUREAU DRAWERS IN ORDER AND IN FIVE MINUTES HE WOULD STIR THEM INTO CHAOS
608-123154-0021 AND HE NEVER SCRUBBED OUT THE TUB AND SHE
608-123154-0022 SHE REALIZED IT FULLY SHE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE SHE WOULDN'T LAUGH AT HIS JOKES I SUPPOSE MOST OLD FASHIONED ORTHODOX PEOPLE WOULD THINK IT AWFUL TO BREAK UP A MARRIAGE ON SUCH INNOCENT GROUNDS
608-123154-0023 BUT AS SHE WENT ON PILING UP DETAIL ON DETAIL EACH TRIVIAL IN ITSELF BUT MAKING A MOUNTAINOUS TOTAL I AGREED WITH HELEN THAT IT WAS AWFUL TO KEEP IT GOING IT WASN'T REALLY A MARRIAGE IT WAS A MISTAKE
608-123154-0024 AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MONTHS HE AGREED WITH HER YOU CAN IMAGINE THE OUTRAGED FEELINGS OF HER VICTORIAN FAMILY IN ALL THE SEVEN GENERATIONS OF THEIR SOJOURN IN AMERICA THEY HAVE NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS TO RECORD IN THE FAMILY BIBLE
608-123154-0025 NO ONE COULD SEE ANY REASON FOR A DIVORCE THE PATHETIC PART OF THE WHOLE BUSINESS IS THAT BOTH SHE AND HENRY WERE ADMIRABLY FITTED TO MAKE SOME ONE ELSE HAPPY THEY JUST SIMPLY DIDN'T MATCH EACH OTHER AND WHEN TWO PEOPLE DON'T MATCH ALL THE CEREMONIES IN THE WORLD CAN'T MARRY THEM
608-123154-0026 WE'VE JUST HAD ONE OF THOSE MISERABLE DECEIVING NIGHTS COLD AND FROSTY WHEN YOU GO TO BED AND WARM AND LIFELESS WHEN YOU WAKE IN THE DARK SMOTHERED UNDER A MOUNTAIN OF BLANKETS
608-123154-0027 I THOUGHT OF THOSE FOURTEEN BUNDLED UP BABIES IN THE FRESH AIR NURSERY THEIR SO CALLED NIGHT NURSE SLEEPS LIKE A TOP THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH HER NAME IS NEXT ON THE LIST TO BE EXPUNGED
608-123154-0028 BUT WHEN I DO I SETTLE WORLD PROBLEMS
608-123154-0029 SHOULD CHANGE OUR MINDS ABOUT LIKING EACH OTHER THE FEAR GRIPS MY HEART AND WRINGS IT DRY BUT I AM MARRYING HIM FOR NO REASON IN THE WORLD EXCEPT AFFECTION I'M NOT PARTICULARLY AMBITIOUS NEITHER HIS POSITION NOR HIS MONEY EVER TEMPTED ME IN THE LEAST
608-123154-0030 AND CERTAINLY I AM NOT DOING IT TO FIND MY LIFE WORK
608-123154-0031 I GO ABOUT PLANNING AND PLANNING THEIR BABY FUTURES FEELING THAT I'M CONSTRUCTING THE NATION WHATEVER BECOMES OF ME IN AFTER LIFE
608-123154-0032 AND IT IS A TREMENDOUS EXPERIENCE THE NEARNESS TO HUMANITY THAT AN ASYLUM BRINGS I AM LEARNING SO MANY NEW THINGS EVERY DAY THAT WHEN EACH SATURDAY NIGHT COMES I LOOK BACK ON THE SALLIE OF LAST SATURDAY NIGHT AMAZED AT HER IGNORANCE
608-123154-0033 MY DESK AND CLOSET AND BUREAU DRAWERS ARE ORGANIZED TO SUIT ME
608-123154-0034 IT ISN'T THAT I LIKE HIM ANY THE LESS BUT I AM GETTING TO LIKE ORPHANS THE MORE I JUST MET OUR MEDICAL ADVISER A FEW MINUTES AGO AS HE WAS EMERGING FROM THE NURSERY
608-123154-0035 HE PAUSED IN PASSING TO MAKE A POLITE COMMENT UPON THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE WEATHER AND TO EXPRESS THE HOPE THAT I WOULD REMEMBER HIM TO MISSUS PENDLETON WHEN I WROTE
608-123154-0036 HAVE A GOOD TIME AND DON'T FORGET THE JOHN GRIER HOME AND SALLIE DECEMBER ELEVENTH DEAR JUDY YOUR JAMAICA LETTER IS HERE AND I'M GLAD TO LEARN THAT JUDY JUNIOR ENJOYS TRAVELING
608-123154-0037 WE ARE RUNNING ALONG HERE VERY MUCH AS USUAL WITHOUT ANYTHING EXCITING TO CHRONICLE YOU REMEMBER LITTLE MAYBELLE FULLER DON'T YOU THE CHORUS GIRL'S DAUGHTER WHOM OUR DOCTOR DOESN'T LIKE
608-123154-0038 I TRIED TO MAKE THE WOMAN TAKE HATTIE HEAPHY INSTEAD THE QUIET LITTLE ONE WHO STOLE THE COMMUNION CUP BUT NO INDEED
608-123154-0039 ALL THEIR SEVEN LIVES THEY VISITED ONE OF THE BIG LINERS SANDY KNOWS THE SCOTCH ENGINEER AND WERE CONDUCTED FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLD TO THE TOP OF THE CROW'S NEST AND THEN HAD LUNCHEON ON BOARD
608-123154-0040 AND AFTER LUNCHEON THEY VISITED THE AQUARIUM AND THE TOP OF THE SINGER BUILDING AND TOOK THE SUBWAY UPTOWN TO SPEND AN HOUR WITH THE BIRDS OF AMERICA IN THEIR HABITATS SANDY WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY PRIED THEM AWAY FROM THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM IN TIME TO CATCH THE SIX FIFTEEN TRAIN
608-123154-0041 DINNER IN THE DINING CAR THEY INQUIRED WITH GREAT PARTICULARITY HOW MUCH IT WAS COSTING AND WHEN THEY HEARD THAT IT WAS THE SAME NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU ATE THEY DREW DEEP BREATHS AND SETTLED QUIETLY AND STEADILY TO THE TASK OF NOT ALLOWING THEIR HOST TO BE CHEATED
608-123154-0042 I DON'T WISH TO BOAST
608-123154-0043 ARE THEY BOUND FOR A REFORMATORY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE NATURAL QUESTION AFTER OBSERVING THE TABLE MANNERS OF HER OFFSPRING MY LITTLE BAND TUMBLED IN TOWARD TEN O'CLOCK EXCITEDLY BABBLING A MESS OF STATISTICS ABOUT RECIPROCATING COMPOUND ENGINES AND WATERTIGHT BULKHEADS
608-123154-0044 DEVIL FISH AND SKY SCRAPERS AND BIRDS OF PARADISE
608-123154-0045 I DO WISH I COULD MANAGE BREAKS IN THE ROUTINE OFTENER
608-123154-0046 HE WAVED ME ASIDE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE AND GROWLINGLY ASKED MISS SNAITH IF SHE COULDN'T ECONOMIZE A LITTLE ON CARBOLIC ACID THE HOUSE SMELT LIKE A HOSPITAL I MUST TELL YOU THAT PUNCH IS BACK WITH US AGAIN ENTIRELY RENOVATED AS TO MANNERS I AM LOOKING FOR A FAMILY TO ADOPT HIM
608-123154-0047 I HAD HOPED THOSE TWO INTELLIGENT SPINSTERS WOULD SEE THEIR WAY TO KEEPING HIM FOREVER
608-123154-0048 AND THEY FEEL HE'S TOO CONSUMING OF THEIR LIBERTY I INCLOSE A SKETCH IN COLORED CHALK OF YOUR STEAMER WHICH HE HAS JUST COMPLETED THERE IS SOME DOUBT AS TO THE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT IS GOING IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT MIGHT PROGRESS BACKWARD AND END IN BROOKLYN
608-123154-0049 OWING TO THE LOSS OF MY BLUE PENCIL OUR FLAG HAS HAD TO ADOPT THE ITALIAN COLORS THE THREE FIGURES ON THE BRIDGE ARE YOU AND JERVIS AND THE BABY I AM PAINED TO NOTE THAT YOU CARRY YOUR DAUGHTER BY THE BACK OF HER NECK AS IF SHE WERE A KITTEN
608-123154-0050 THAT IS NOT THE WAY WE HANDLE BABIES IN THE J G H NURSERY PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT THE ARTIST HAS GIVEN JERVIS HIS FULL DUE IN THE MATTER OF LEGS WHEN I ASKED PUNCH WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE CAPTAIN
