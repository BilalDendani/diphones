7942-283384-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN SELF CONSCIOUSNESS AND TIMIDITY FOES TO SUCCESS TIMID SHY PEOPLE ARE MORBIDLY SELF CONSCIOUS THEY THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT THEMSELVES
7942-283384-0001 THEIR THOUGHTS ARE ALWAYS TURNED INWARD THEY ARE ALWAYS ANALYZING DISSECTING THEMSELVES WONDERING HOW THEY APPEAR AND WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF THEM IF THESE PEOPLE COULD ONLY FORGET THEMSELVES AND THINK OF OTHERS
7942-283384-0002 THEY WOULD BE SURPRISED TO SEE WHAT FREEDOM EASE AND GRACE THEY WOULD GAIN WHAT SUCCESS IN LIFE THEY WOULD ACHIEVE TIMIDITY SHYNESS AND SELF CONSCIOUSNESS
7942-283384-0003 ONLY TO LEARN OUR STRENGTH FATAL IF WE DWELL UPON OUR WEAKNESSES THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE HELD BACK FROM UNDERTAKING WHAT THEY LONG TO DO
7942-283384-0004 THEIR SUPER SENSITIVENESS MAKES COWARDS OF THEM OVER SENSITIVENESS WHETHER IN MAN OR WOMAN IS REALLY AN EXAGGERATED FORM OF SELF CONSCIOUSNESS IT IS FAR REMOVED FROM CONCEIT
7942-283384-0005 OR SELF ESTEEM YET IT CAUSES ONE'S PERSONALITY TO OVERSHADOW EVERYTHING ELSE A SENSITIVE PERSON FEELS THAT WHATEVER HE DOES WHEREVER HE GOES OR WHATEVER HE SAYS
7942-283384-0006 HE IS THE CENTER OF OBSERVATION HE IMAGINES THAT PEOPLE ARE CRITICIZING HIS MOVEMENTS MAKING FUN AT HIS EXPENSE OR ANALYZING HIS CHARACTER WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLY NOT THINKING OF HIM AT ALL
7942-283384-0007 WHEN HE THINKS THEY ARE AIMING REMARKS AT HIM PUTTING SLIGHTS UPON HIM OR TRYING TO HOLD HIM UP TO THE RIDICULE OF OTHERS THEY MAY NOT BE EVEN CONSCIOUS OF HIS PRESENCE
7942-283384-0008 MORBID SENSITIVENESS REQUIRES HEROIC TREATMENT A SUFFERER WHO WISHES TO OVERCOME IT MUST TAKE HIMSELF IN HAND
7942-283384-0009 AS DETERMINEDLY AS HE WOULD IF HE WISHED TO GET CONTROL OF A QUICK TEMPER OR TO RID HIMSELF OF A HABIT OF LYING OR STEALING OR DRINKING OR ANY OTHER DEFECT WHICH PREVENTED
7942-283384-0010 HIS BEING A WHOLE MAN WHAT SHALL I DO TO GET RID OF IT ASKS A VICTIM THINK LESS OF YOURSELF AND MORE OF OTHERS MINGLE FREELY WITH PEOPLE BECOME INTERESTED
7942-283384-0011 IN THINGS OUTSIDE OF YOURSELF DO NOT BROOD OVER WHAT IS SAID TO YOU OR ANALYZE EVERY SIMPLE REMARK UNTIL YOU MAGNIFY IT INTO SOMETHING OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE DO NOT HAVE SUCH A LOW AND UNJUST ESTIMATE OF PEOPLE
7942-283384-0012 AS TO THINK THEY ARE BENT ON NOTHING BUT HURTING THE FEELINGS OF OTHERS AND DEPRECIATING AND MAKING LIGHT OF THEM ON EVERY POSSIBLE OCCASION A MAN WHO APPRECIATES HIMSELF AT HIS TRUE VALUE
7942-283384-0013 AND WHO GIVES HIS NEIGHBORS CREDIT FOR BEING AT LEAST AS GOOD AS HE IS CANNOT BE A VICTIM OF OVER SENSITIVENESS ONE OF THE BEST SCHOOLS FOR A SENSITIVE BOY IS A LARGE BUSINESS HOUSE
7942-283384-0014 HE WILL REALIZE THAT HE MUST BE A MAN AND GIVE AND TAKE WITH THE OTHERS OR GET OUT HE WILL BE ASHAMED TO PLAY CRY BABY EVERY TIME HE FEELS HURT
7942-283384-0015 BUT WILL MAKE UP HIS MIND TO GRIN AND BEAR IT WORKING IN COMPETITION WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND SEEING THAT EXACTLY THE SAME TREATMENT IS GIVEN TO THOSE ABOVE HIM AS TO HIMSELF TAKES THE NONSENSE OUT OF HIM
7942-283384-0016 HE BEGINS TO SEE THAT THE WORLD IS TOO BUSY TO BOTHER ITSELF ESPECIALLY ABOUT HIM AND THAT EVEN WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AT HIM THEY ARE NOT USUALLY THINKING OF HIM
7942-283384-0017 OF OVER REFINED SENSIBILITIES OFTENTIMES WHEN BOYS ENTER COLLEGE AS FRESHMEN THEY ARE SO TOUCHY THAT THEIR SENSE OF HONOR IS CONSTANTLY BEING HURT AND THEIR PRIDE STUNG
7942-283384-0018 BY THE UNCONSCIOUS THRUSTS OF CLASSMATES AND COMPANIONS BUT AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN IN COLLEGE A TERM
7942-283384-0019 BUT GOOD HUMORED MANNER BY YOUTHS OF THEIR OWN AGE THEY REALIZE THAT IT WOULD BE THE MOST FOOLISH THING IN THE WORLD TO BETRAY RESENTMENT IF ONE SHOWS THAT HE IS HURT HE KNOWS THAT HE WILL BE CALLED THE CLASS BOOBY
7942-283384-0020 AND TEASED UNMERCIFULLY SO HE IS SIMPLY FORCED TO DROP HIS FOOLISH SENSITIVENESS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE OUT OF POSITIONS AND CANNOT KEEP PLACES WHEN THEY GET THEM BECAUSE OF THIS WEAKNESS
7942-283384-0021 MANY A GOOD BUSINESS MAN HAS BEEN KEPT BACK OR EVEN RUINED BY HIS QUICKNESS TO TAKE OFFENSE OR TO RESENT A FANCIED SLIGHT THERE IS MANY A CLERGYMAN WELL EDUCATED AND ABLE
7942-283384-0022 WHO IS SO SENSITIVE THAT HE CAN NOT KEEP A PASTORATE LONG FROM HIS DISTORTED VIEWPOINT
7942-283384-0023 SAYING AND THINKING UNKIND THINGS
7942-283384-0024 CALCULATED TO INJURE HIM IN THE EYES OF THE CONGREGATION MANY SCHOOLTEACHERS ARE GREAT SUFFERERS FROM OVER SENSITIVENESS REMARKS OF PARENTS OR SCHOOL COMMITTEES
7942-283384-0025 ARE USUALLY VERY SENSITIVE I HAVE IN MIND A VERY STRONG VIGOROUS EDITORIAL WRITER
7942-283384-0026 OR A DAILY PAPER HE IS CUT TO THE VERY QUICK BY THE SLIGHTEST CRITICISM AND REGARDS EVERY SUGGESTION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF HIS WORK AS A PERSONAL AFFRONT HE ALWAYS CARRIES ABOUT AN INJURED AIR
7942-283384-0027 A FEELING THAT HE HAS BEEN IMPOSED UPON WHICH GREATLY DETRACTS FROM AN OTHERWISE AGREEABLE PERSONALITY THE GREAT MAJORITY OF PEOPLE NO MATTER HOW ROUGH IN MANNER OR BEARING ARE KIND HEARTED AND WOULD MUCH RATHER HELP
7942-283384-0028 THAN HINDER A FELLOWBEING BUT THEY HAVE ALL THEY CAN DO TO ATTEND TO THEIR OWN AFFAIRS
7942-283384-0029 THE NATURE AND FEELING OF THOSE WHOM THEY MEET IN THE COURSE OF THEIR DAILY BUSINESS IN THE BUSY WORLD OF AFFAIRS IT IS GIVE AND TAKE TOUCH AND GO AND THOSE WHO EXPECT TO GET ON
7942-283384-0030 MUST RID THEMSELVES OF ALL MORBID SENSITIVENESS IF THEY DO NOT THEY DOOM THEMSELVES TO UNHAPPINESS AND FAILURE SELF CONSCIOUSNESS IS A FOE TO GREATNESS IN EVERY LINE OF ENDEAVOR
7942-283384-0031 UNTIL HE FEELS THAT HE IS A PART OF SOMETHING GREATER THAN HIMSELF UNTIL HE SURRENDERS TO THAT GREATER PRINCIPLE SOME OF OUR BEST WRITERS NEVER FOUND THEMSELVES NEVER TOUCHED THEIR POWER
7942-283384-0032 UNTIL THEY FORGOT THEIR RULES FOR CONSTRUCTION THEIR GRAMMAR THEIR RHETORICAL ARRANGEMENT BY LOSING THEMSELVES IN THEIR SUBJECT THEN THEY FOUND THEIR STYLE
7942-283384-0033 IT IS WHEN A WRITER IS SO COMPLETELY CARRIED AWAY WITH HIS SUBJECT THAT HE CANNOT HELP WRITING
7942-283384-0034 NO ORATOR HAS EVER ELECTRIFIED AN AUDIENCE WHILE HE WAS THINKING OF HIS STYLE OR WAS CONSCIOUS OF HIS RHETORIC OR TRYING TO APPLY THE CONVENTIONAL RULES OF ORATORY IT IS WHEN THE ORATOR'S SOUL
7942-283384-0035 IS ON FIRE WITH HIS THEME AND HE FORGETS HIS AUDIENCE FORGETS EVERYTHING BUT HIS SUBJECT THAT HE REALLY DOES A GREAT THING NO PAINTER EVER DID A GREAT MASTERPIECE
7942-283384-0036 WHEN TRYING TO KEEP ALL THE RULES OF HIS PROFESSION THE LAWS OF DRAWING OF PERSPECTIVE THE SCIENCE OF COLOR IN HIS MIND EVERYTHING MUST BE SWALLOWED UP IN HIS ZEAL
7942-283384-0037 FUSED IN THE FIRE OF HIS GENIUS THEN AND THEN ONLY CAN HE REALLY CREATE NO SINGER EVER CAPTIVATED HER AUDIENCE UNTIL SHE FORGOT HERSELF
7942-283384-0038 UNTIL SHE WAS LOST IN HER SONG COULD ANYTHING BE MORE FOOLISH AND SHORT SIGHTED THAN TO ALLOW A MORBID SENSITIVENESS TO INTERFERE WITH ONE'S ADVANCEMENT IN LIFE
7942-283384-0039 CAPABLE OF FILLING A SUPERIOR POSITION WHO HAS BEEN KEPT IN A VERY ORDINARY SITUATION FOR YEARS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF HER MORBID SENSITIVENESS SHE TAKES IT FOR GRANTED
7942-283384-0040 THAT IF ANY CRITICISM IS MADE IN THE DEPARTMENT WHERE SHE WORKS IT IS INTENDED FOR HER AND SHE FLIES OFF THE HANDLE
7942-283384-0041 THAT HE IS OBLIGED TO BE ON HIS GUARD EVERY MOMENT LEST HE WOUND HIM OR TOUCH A SORE SPOT IT MAKES AN EMPLOYER VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO FEEL THAT THOSE ABOUT HIM ARE CARRYING AROUND AN INJURED AIR
7942-283384-0042 WITHOUT EVER INTENDING IT A MAN WANTS TO FEEL THAT HIS EMPLOYEES UNDERSTAND HIM AND THAT THEY TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE THOUSAND AND ONE LITTLE VEXATIONS AND HAPPENINGS WHICH ARE EXTREMELY TRYING
7942-283384-0043 AND THAT IF HE DOES NOT HAPPEN TO APPROACH THEM WITH A SMILING FACE WITH CONSIDERATION AND FRIENDLINESS IN HIS WORDS OR COMMANDS THEY WILL NOT TAKE OFFENSE THEY WILL THINK OF HIS TROUBLES NOT THEIR OWN
7942-283384-0044 IF THEY ARE WISE THEY WILL FORGET SELF AND CONTRIBUTE THEIR ZEAL
