1819-144401-0008 SO JEANETTE WAS WRAPPED IN SOFT TISSUE PAPER AND TAKEN AWAY LATER IN THE DAY MARCELLA CAME BOUNCING INTO THE NURSERY WITH A SURPRISE FOR THE DOLLS IT WAS A DEAR FUZZY LITTLE KITTEN MARCELLA INTRODUCED THE KITTEN TO ALL THE DOLLS
1819-144401-0009 HER NAME IS BOOTS BECAUSE SHE HAS FOUR LITTLE WHITE FEET SAID MARCELLA SO BOOTS THE HAPPY LITTLE CREATURE PLAYED WITH THE PENNY DOLLS SCRAPING THEM OVER THE FLOOR AND PEEPING OUT FROM BEHIND CHAIRS AND POUNCING UPON THEM
1819-144401-0010 AS IF THEY WERE MICE AND THE PENNY DOLLS ENJOYED IT HUGELY WHEN MARCELLA WAS NOT IN THE NURSERY RAGGEDY ANN WRESTLED WITH BOOTS AND THEY WOULD ROLL OVER AND OVER UPON THE FLOOR BOOTS WITH HER FRONT FEET AROUND RAGGEDY ANN'S NECK
1819-144401-0011 THEN SHE WOULD JUMP AT HER AND OVER AND OVER THEY WOULD ROLL THEIR HEADS HITTING THE FLOOR BUMPITY BUMP BOOTS SLEPT IN THE NURSERY THAT NIGHT AND WAS LONELY FOR HER MAMMA FOR IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD BEEN AWAY FROM HOME
1819-144401-0012 EVEN THOUGH HER BED WAS RIGHT ON TOP OF RAGGEDY ANN SHE COULD NOT SLEEP BUT RAGGEDY ANN WAS VERY GLAD TO HAVE BOOTS SLEEP WITH HER EVEN IF SHE WAS HEAVY AND WHEN BOOTS BEGAN CRYING FOR HER MAMMA RAGGEDY ANN COMFORTED HER
1819-144401-0013 AND SOON BOOTS WENT TO SLEEP ONE DAY JEANETTE CAME HOME
1819-144401-0014 AND SHE WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS EVER NOW BY THIS TIME BOOTS WAS ONE OF THE FAMILY AND DID NOT CRY AT NIGHT BESIDES
1819-144401-0015 SO SHE PROMISED TO SLEEP WITH ONE EYE OPEN LATE THAT NIGHT WHEN BOOTS WAS THE ONLY ONE AWAKE OUT POPPED A TINY MOUSE FROM THE HOLE
1819-144401-0016 BOOTS JUMPED AFTER THE MOUSE AND HIT AGAINST THE TOY PIANO AND MADE THE KEYS TINKLE SO LOUDLY IT AWAKENED THE DOLLS THEY RAN OVER TO WHERE BOOTS SAT GROWLING WITH THE TINY MOUSE IN HER MOUTH MY HOW THE MOUSE WAS SQUEAKING
1819-144401-0017 RAGGEDY ANN DID NOT LIKE TO HEAR IT SQUEAK BUT SHE DID NOT WISH JEANETTE TO HAVE HER WAX FACE CHEWED AGAIN EITHER SO RAGGEDY ANN SAID TO THE TINY LITTLE MOUSE YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN TO COME HERE WHEN BOOTS IS WITH US
1819-144401-0018 WHY DON'T YOU GO OUT IN THE BARN AND LIVE WHERE YOU WILL NOT DESTROY ANYTHING OF VALUE I DID NOT KNOW SQUEAKED THE LITTLE MOUSE

1819-144401-0022 BUT BOOTS ONLY GROWLED THE DOLLS DREW TO ONE SIDE WHERE RAGGEDY ANN AND UNCLE CLEM WHISPERED TOGETHER AND WHILE THEY WHISPERED BOOTS WOULD LET THE LITTLE MAMMA MOUSE RUN A PIECE THEN SHE WOULD CATCH IT AGAIN
1819-144401-0023 AND BOX IT ABOUT BETWEEN HER PAWS THIS SHE DID UNTIL THE POOR LITTLE MAMMA MOUSE GREW SO TIRED IT COULD SCARCELY RUN AWAY FROM BOOTS
1819-144401-0024 AS SHE WATCHED THE LITTLE MOUSE CRAWLING TOWARDS THE HOLE SCARCELY ABLE TO MOVE RAGGEDY ANN COULD NOT KEEP THE TEARS FROM HER SHOE BUTTON EYES FINALLY AS BOOTS STARTED TO SPRING AFTER THE LITTLE MOUSE AGAIN
