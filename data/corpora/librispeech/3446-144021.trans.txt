3446-144021-0000 AND ON TWO OCCASIONS PROVED CAPABLE OF FURNISHING JUICE FOR THE SEARCH LIGHT THE STORAGE BATTERIES WORKED FOUR OR FIVE TIMES IN THE COURSE OF TWO YEARS THE FOURTEEN FOOT LAUNCH WAS RUMOURED TO WORK AT TIMES BUT IT INVARIABLY BROKE DOWN WHENEVER I STEPPED ON BOARD
3446-144021-0001 BUT THE SNARK SAILED IT WAS THE ONLY WAY SHE COULD GET ANYWHERE SHE SAILED FOR TWO YEARS AND NEVER TOUCHED ROCK REEF NOR SHOAL SHE HAD NO INSIDE BALLAST HER IRON KEEL WEIGHED FIVE TONS BUT HER DEEP DRAUGHT AND HIGH FREEBOARD MADE HER VERY STIFF
3446-144021-0002 SHE STEERED EASILY AND SHE COULD RUN DAY AND NIGHT WITHOUT STEERING CLOSE BY FULL AND BY AND WITH THE WIND ABEAM
3446-144021-0003 SHE STEERED HERSELF WITHIN TWO POINTS AND WITH THE WIND ALMOST ASTERN SHE REQUIRED SCARCELY THREE POINTS FOR SELF STEERING
3446-144021-0004 AS IT WAS PARTLY BUILT SHE COST FOUR TIMES WHAT SHE OUGHT TO HAVE COST THE SNARK WAS BORN UNFORTUNATELY SHE WAS LIBELLED IN SAN FRANCISCO HAD HER CHEQUES PROTESTED AS FRAUDULENT IN HAWAII AND WAS FINED FOR BREACH OF QUARANTINE IN THE SOLOMONS
3446-144021-0005 TO SAVE THEMSELVES THE NEWSPAPERS COULD NOT TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT HER WHEN I DISCHARGED AN INCOMPETENT CAPTAIN THEY SAID I HAD BEATEN HIM TO A PULP WHEN ONE YOUNG MAN RETURNED HOME TO CONTINUE AT COLLEGE IT WAS REPORTED THAT I WAS A REGULAR WOLF LARSEN
3446-144021-0006 BUT NEITHER OF US WAS SERIOUSLY MAIMED THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME I BUILT THE SNARK AND PAID FOR IT AND FOR ALL EXPENSES I CONTRACTED TO WRITE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND WORDS DESCRIPTIVE OF THE TRIP FOR A MAGAZINE WHICH WAS TO PAY ME THE SAME RATE I RECEIVED FOR STORIES WRITTEN AT HOME
3446-144021-0007 PROMPTLY THE MAGAZINE ADVERTISED THAT IT WAS SENDING ME ESPECIALLY AROUND THE WORLD FOR ITSELF IT WAS A WEALTHY MAGAZINE AND EVERY MAN WHO HAD BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THE SNARK CHARGED THREE PRICES BECAUSE FORSOOTH THE MAGAZINE COULD AFFORD IT
3446-144021-0008 DOWN IN THE UTTERMOST SOUTH SEA ISLE THIS MYTH OBTAINED AND I PAID ACCORDINGLY TO THIS DAY EVERYBODY BELIEVES THAT THE MAGAZINE PAID FOR EVERYTHING AND THAT I MADE A FORTUNE OUT OF THE VOYAGE
3446-144021-0009 IT IS HARD AFTER SUCH ADVERTISING TO HAMMER IT INTO THE HUMAN UNDERSTANDING THAT THE WHOLE VOYAGE WAS DONE FOR THE FUN OF IT I WENT TO AUSTRALIA TO GO INTO HOSPITAL WHERE I SPENT FIVE WEEKS I SPENT FIVE MONTHS MISERABLY SICK IN HOTELS
3446-144021-0010 WITH SEVEN DEAD AND DYING SKINS PEELING OFF AT THE SAME TIME THERE WERE TIMES WHEN MY TOE NAILS IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS GREW AS THICK AS THEY WERE LONG AFTER FILING THEM OFF INSIDE ANOTHER TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY WERE AS THICK AS BEFORE
3446-144021-0011 THE AUSTRALIAN SPECIALISTS AGREED THAT THE MALADY WAS NON PARASITIC AND THAT THEREFORE IT MUST BE NERVOUS IT DID NOT MEND AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO CONTINUE THE VOYAGE THE ONLY WAY I COULD HAVE CONTINUED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BY BEING LASHED IN MY BUNK
3446-144021-0012 ALSO I SAID TO MYSELF THAT WHILE THERE WERE MANY BOATS AND MANY VOYAGES I HAD BUT ONE PAIR OF HANDS AND ONE SET OF TOE NAILS STILL FURTHER I REASONED THAT IN MY OWN CLIMATE OF CALIFORNIA I HAD ALWAYS MAINTAINED A STABLE NERVOUS EQUILIBRIUM
3446-144021-0013 SO BACK I CAME SINCE MY RETURN I HAVE COMPLETELY RECOVERED
3446-144021-0014 EFFECTS OF TROPICAL LIGHT ON WHITE MEN THEN I KNEW LATER I MET COLONEL WOODRUFF AND LEARNED THAT HE HAD BEEN SIMILARLY AFFLICTED HIMSELF AN ARMY SURGEON
3446-144021-0015 THEY KNOW NOT WHAT IT GOES THEY KNOW NOT WHY WITHOUT THE USE OF DRUGS MERELY BY LIVING IN THE WHOLESOME CALIFORNIA CLIMATE MY SILVERY SKIN VANISHED THE ONLY HOPE THE DOCTORS HAD HELD OUT TO ME WAS A SPONTANEOUS CURE
3446-144021-0016 AND SUCH A CURE WAS MINE A LAST WORD THE TEST OF THE VOYAGE IT IS EASY ENOUGH FOR ME OR ANY MAN TO SAY THAT IT WAS ENJOYABLE BUT THERE IS A BETTER WITNESS THE ONE WOMAN WHO MADE IT FROM BEGINNING TO END
