209-157830-0000 LADY RUSSELL WAS MOST ANXIOUSLY ZEALOUS ON THE SUBJECT AND GAVE IT MUCH SERIOUS CONSIDERATION SHE WAS A WOMAN RATHER OF SOUND THAN OF QUICK ABILITIES WHOSE DIFFICULTIES IN COMING TO ANY DECISION IN THIS INSTANCE WERE GREAT
209-157830-0001 FROM THE OPPOSITION OF TWO LEADING PRINCIPLES SHE WAS OF STRICT INTEGRITY HERSELF WITH A DELICATE SENSE OF HONOUR BUT SHE WAS AS DESIROUS OF SAVING SIR WALTER'S FEELINGS AS SOLICITOUS FOR THE CREDIT OF THE FAMILY
209-157830-0002 STRICT IN HER NOTIONS OF DECORUM AND WITH MANNERS THAT WERE HELD A STANDARD OF GOOD BREEDING SHE HAD A CULTIVATED MIND AND WAS GENERALLY SPEAKING RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT BUT SHE HAD PREJUDICES ON THE SIDE OF ANCESTRY
209-157830-0003 SHE HAD A VALUE FOR RANK AND CONSEQUENCE WHICH BLINDED HER A LITTLE TO THE FAULTS OF THOSE WHO POSSESSED THEM HERSELF THE WIDOW OF ONLY A KNIGHT SHE GAVE THE DIGNITY OF A BARONET ALL ITS DUE AND SIR WALTER
209-157830-0004 UNDER HIS PRESENT DIFFICULTIES THEY MUST RETRENCH THAT DID NOT ADMIT OF A DOUBT BUT SHE WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE IT DONE WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE PAIN TO HIM AND ELIZABETH SHE DREW UP PLANS OF ECONOMY
209-157830-0005 SHE MADE EXACT CALCULATIONS AND SHE DID WHAT NOBODY ELSE THOUGHT OF DOING SHE CONSULTED ANNE WHO NEVER SEEMED CONSIDERED BY THE OTHERS AS HAVING ANY INTEREST IN THE QUESTION SHE CONSULTED AND IN A DEGREE WAS INFLUENCED BY HER
209-157830-0006 IN MARKING OUT THE SCHEME OF RETRENCHMENT WHICH WAS AT LAST SUBMITTED TO SIR WALTER EVERY EMENDATION OF ANNE'S HAD BEEN ON THE SIDE OF HONESTY AGAINST IMPORTANCE SHE WANTED MORE VIGOROUS MEASURES A MORE COMPLETE REFORMATION A QUICKER RELEASE FROM DEBT
209-157830-0007 A MUCH HIGHER TONE OF INDIFFERENCE FOR EVERYTHING BUT JUSTICE AND EQUITY IF WE CAN PERSUADE YOUR FATHER TO ALL THIS SAID LADY RUSSELL LOOKING OVER HER PAPER MUCH MAY BE DONE IF HE WILL ADOPT THESE REGULATIONS IN SEVEN YEARS HE WILL BE CLEAR
209-157830-0008 THAT KELLYNCH HALL HAS A RESPECTABILITY IN ITSELF WHICH CANNOT BE AFFECTED BY THESE REDUCTIONS AND THAT THE TRUE DIGNITY OF SIR WALTER ELLIOT WILL BE VERY FAR FROM LESSENED IN THE EYES OF SENSIBLE PEOPLE
209-157830-0009 WE MUST BE SERIOUS AND DECIDED
209-157830-0010 SHE CONSIDERED IT AS AN ACT OF INDISPENSABLE DUTY TO CLEAR AWAY THE CLAIMS OF CREDITORS WITH ALL THE EXPEDITION WHICH THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE RETRENCHMENTS COULD SECURE AND SAW NO DIGNITY IN ANYTHING SHORT OF IT SHE WANTED IT TO BE PRESCRIBED
209-157830-0011 AND FELT AS A DUTY SHE RATED LADY RUSSELL'S INFLUENCE HIGHLY AND AS TO THE SEVERE DEGREE OF SELF DENIAL WHICH HER OWN CONSCIENCE PROMPTED SHE BELIEVED THERE MIGHT BE LITTLE MORE DIFFICULTY IN PERSUADING THEM TO A COMPLETE THAN TO HALF A REFORMATION
209-157830-0012 AND SO ON THROUGH THE WHOLE LIST OF LADY RUSSELL'S TOO GENTLE REDUCTIONS HOW ANNE'S MORE RIGID REQUISITIONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE LADY RUSSELL'S HAD NO SUCCESS AT ALL COULD NOT BE PUT UP WITH WERE NOT TO BE BORNE
209-157830-0013 WHAT EVERY COMFORT OF LIFE KNOCKED OFF JOURNEYS LONDON SERVANTS HORSES TABLE CONTRACTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS EVERY WHERE TO LIVE NO LONGER WITH THE DECENCIES EVEN OF A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN NO
209-157830-0014 HE WOULD SOONER QUIT KELLYNCH HALL AT ONCE THAN REMAIN IN IT ON SUCH DISGRACEFUL TERMS QUIT KELLYNCH HALL THE HINT WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN UP BY MISTER SHEPHERD WHOSE INTEREST WAS INVOLVED IN THE REALITY OF SIR WALTER'S RETRENCHING
209-157830-0015 AND WHO WAS PERFECTLY PERSUADED THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE WITHOUT A CHANGE OF ABODE SINCE THE IDEA HAD BEEN STARTED IN THE VERY QUARTER WHICH OUGHT TO DICTATE HE HAD NO SCRUPLE HE SAID IN CONFESSING HIS JUDGEMENT TO BE ENTIRELY ON THAT SIDE
209-157830-0016 IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HIM THAT SIR WALTER COULD MATERIALLY ALTER HIS STYLE OF LIVING IN A HOUSE WHICH HAD SUCH A CHARACTER OF HOSPITALITY AND ANCIENT DIGNITY TO SUPPORT IN ANY OTHER PLACE SIR WALTER MIGHT JUDGE FOR HIMSELF AND WOULD BE LOOKED UP TO AS REGULATING THE MODES OF LIFE
209-157830-0017 IN WHATEVER WAY HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO MODEL HIS HOUSEHOLD SIR WALTER WOULD QUIT KELLYNCH HALL AND AFTER A VERY FEW DAYS MORE OF DOUBT AND INDECISION THE GREAT QUESTION OF WHITHER HE SHOULD GO WAS SETTLED AND THE FIRST OUTLINE OF THIS IMPORTANT CHANGE MADE OUT
209-157830-0018 LONDON BATH OR ANOTHER HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY ALL ANNE'S WISHES HAD BEEN FOR THE LATTER A SMALL HOUSE IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE THEY MIGHT STILL HAVE LADY RUSSELL'S SOCIETY STILL BE NEAR MARY
209-157830-0019 AND STILL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES SEEING THE LAWNS AND GROVES OF KELLYNCH WAS THE OBJECT OF HER AMBITION BUT THE USUAL FATE OF ANNE ATTENDED HER IN HAVING SOMETHING VERY OPPOSITE FROM HER INCLINATION FIXED ON SHE DISLIKED BATH AND DID NOT THINK IT AGREED WITH HER
209-157830-0020 AND BATH WAS TO BE HER HOME SIR WALTER HAD AT FIRST THOUGHT MORE OF LONDON BUT MISTER SHEPHERD FELT THAT HE COULD NOT BE TRUSTED IN LONDON AND HAD BEEN SKILFUL ENOUGH TO DISSUADE HIM FROM IT AND MAKE BATH PREFERRED
209-157830-0021 IT WAS A MUCH SAFER PLACE FOR A GENTLEMAN IN HIS PREDICAMENT HE MIGHT THERE BE IMPORTANT AT COMPARATIVELY LITTLE EXPENSE TWO MATERIAL ADVANTAGES OF BATH OVER LONDON HAD OF COURSE BEEN GIVEN ALL THEIR WEIGHT
209-157830-0022 THAT THEY SHOULD LOSE NEITHER CONSEQUENCE NOR ENJOYMENT BY SETTLING THERE LADY RUSSELL FELT OBLIGED TO OPPOSE HER DEAR ANNE'S KNOWN WISHES
209-157830-0023 BY PASSING ALL THE WARM MONTHS WITH HER AT KELLYNCH LODGE EVERY DANGER WOULD BE AVOIDED AND IT WAS IN FACT A CHANGE WHICH MUST DO BOTH HEALTH AND SPIRITS GOOD ANNE HAD BEEN TOO LITTLE FROM HOME TOO LITTLE SEEN HER SPIRITS WERE NOT HIGH
209-157830-0024 A LARGER SOCIETY WOULD IMPROVE THEM SHE WANTED HER TO BE MORE KNOWN THE UNDESIRABLENESS OF ANY OTHER HOUSE IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD FOR SIR WALTER WAS CERTAINLY MUCH STRENGTHENED BY ONE PART AND A VERY MATERIAL PART OF THE SCHEME
209-157830-0025 WHICH HAD BEEN HAPPILY ENGRAFTED ON THE BEGINNING HE WAS NOT ONLY TO QUIT HIS HOME BUT TO SEE IT IN THE HANDS OF OTHERS A TRIAL OF FORTITUDE WHICH STRONGER HEADS THAN SIR WALTER'S HAVE FOUND TOO MUCH KELLYNCH HALL WAS TO BE LET
209-157830-0026 THIS HOWEVER WAS A PROFOUND SECRET NOT TO BE BREATHED BEYOND THEIR OWN CIRCLE SIR WALTER COULD NOT HAVE BORNE THE DEGRADATION OF BEING KNOWN TO DESIGN LETTING HIS HOUSE MISTER SHEPHERD HAD ONCE MENTIONED THE WORD ADVERTISE
209-157830-0027 ON HIS OWN TERMS AND AS A GREAT FAVOUR THAT HE WOULD LET IT AT ALL HOW QUICK COME THE REASONS FOR APPROVING WHAT WE LIKE LADY RUSSELL HAD ANOTHER EXCELLENT ONE AT HAND FOR BEING EXTREMELY GLAD THAT SIR WALTER AND HIS FAMILY WERE TO REMOVE FROM THE COUNTRY
209-157830-0028 ELIZABETH HAD BEEN LATELY FORMING AN INTIMACY WHICH SHE WISHED TO SEE INTERRUPTED IT WAS WITH THE DAUGHTER OF MISTER SHEPHERD WHO HAD RETURNED AFTER AN UNPROSPEROUS MARRIAGE TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE WITH THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN OF TWO CHILDREN
209-157830-0029 SHE WAS A CLEVER YOUNG WOMAN WHO UNDERSTOOD THE ART OF PLEASING
209-157830-0030 AS TO HAVE BEEN ALREADY STAYING THERE MORE THAN ONCE IN SPITE OF ALL THAT LADY RUSSELL WHO THOUGHT IT A FRIENDSHIP QUITE OUT OF PLACE COULD HINT OF CAUTION AND RESERVE LADY RUSSELL INDEED HAD SCARCELY ANY INFLUENCE WITH ELIZABETH
209-157830-0031 AND SEEMED TO LOVE HER RATHER BECAUSE SHE WOULD LOVE HER THAN BECAUSE ELIZABETH DESERVED IT SHE HAD NEVER RECEIVED FROM HER MORE THAN OUTWARD ATTENTION NOTHING BEYOND THE OBSERVANCES OF COMPLAISANCE HAD NEVER SUCCEEDED IN ANY POINT WHICH SHE WANTED TO CARRY AGAINST PREVIOUS INCLINATION
209-157830-0032 SHE HAD BEEN REPEATEDLY VERY EARNEST IN TRYING TO GET ANNE INCLUDED IN THE VISIT TO LONDON SENSIBLY OPEN TO ALL THE INJUSTICE
209-157830-0033 AND ON MANY LESSER OCCASIONS HAD ENDEAVOURED TO GIVE ELIZABETH THE ADVANTAGE OF HER OWN BETTER JUDGEMENT AND EXPERIENCE BUT ALWAYS IN VAIN ELIZABETH WOULD GO HER OWN WAY AND NEVER HAD SHE PURSUED IT IN MORE DECIDED OPPOSITION TO LADY RUSSELL THAN IN THIS SELECTION OF MISSUS CLAY
209-157830-0034 TURNING FROM THE SOCIETY OF SO DESERVING A SISTER TO BESTOW HER AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE ON ONE WHO OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN NOTHING TO HER BUT THE OBJECT OF DISTANT CIVILITY FROM SITUATION MISSUS CLAY WAS IN LADY RUSSELL'S
