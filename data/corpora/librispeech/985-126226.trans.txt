985-126226-0000 WHEN HE RETURNED SHE WAS DRESSED AS USUAL NOW COULD I GET OUT WITHOUT ANYBODY SEEING ME SHE ASKED THE TOWN IS NOT YET ASTIR BUT YOU HAVE HAD NO BREAKFAST OH I DON'T WANT ANY I FEAR I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE RUN AWAY FROM THAT SCHOOL
985-126226-0001 THINGS SEEM SO DIFFERENT IN THE COLD LIGHT OF MORNING DON'T THEY WHAT MISTER PHILLOTSON WILL SAY I DON'T KNOW IT WAS QUITE BY HIS WISH THAT I WENT THERE HE IS THE ONLY MAN IN THE WORLD FOR WHOM I HAVE ANY RESPECT OR FEAR I HOPE HE'LL FORGIVE ME BUT HE'LL SCOLD ME DREADFULLY I EXPECT
985-126226-0002 BEGAN JUDE OH NO YOU SHAN'T I DON'T CARE FOR HIM HE MAY THINK WHAT HE LIKES I SHALL DO JUST AS I CHOOSE BUT YOU JUST THIS MOMENT SAID WELL IF I DID I SHALL DO AS I LIKE FOR ALL HIM I HAVE THOUGHT OF WHAT I SHALL DO
985-126226-0003 IN A PORTABLE APPARATUS HE KEPT IN HIS ROOM FOR USE ON RISING TO GO TO HIS WORK EVERY DAY BEFORE THE HOUSEHOLD WAS ASTIR NOW A DEW BIT TO EAT WITH IT HE SAID AND OFF WE GO YOU CAN HAVE A REGULAR BREAKFAST WHEN YOU GET THERE THEY WENT QUIETLY OUT OF THE HOUSE JUDE ACCOMPANYING HER TO THE STATION
985-126226-0004 AND TO WISH SHE HAD NOT REBELLED TELLING HIM AT PARTING THAT SHE WOULD LET HIM KNOW AS SOON AS SHE GOT RE ADMITTED TO THE TRAINING SCHOOL THEY STOOD RATHER MISERABLY TOGETHER ON THE PLATFORM
985-126226-0005 I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING TWO THINGS HE SAID HURRIEDLY AS THE TRAIN CAME UP ONE IS A WARM ONE THE OTHER A COLD ONE JUDE SHE SAID I KNOW ONE OF THEM AND YOU MUSTN'T WHAT YOU MUSTN'T LOVE ME
985-126226-0006 YOU ARE TO LIKE ME THAT'S ALL JUDE'S FACE BECAME SO FULL OF COMPLICATED GLOOMS THAT HERS WAS AGITATED IN SYMPATHY AS SHE BADE HIM ADIEU THROUGH THE CARRIAGE WINDOW AND THEN THE TRAIN MOVED ON AND WAVING HER PRETTY HAND TO HIM SHE VANISHED AWAY
985-126226-0007 MELCHESTER WAS A DISMAL PLACE ENOUGH FOR JUDE THAT SUNDAY OF HER DEPARTURE AND THE CLOSE SO HATEFUL THAT HE DID NOT GO ONCE TO THE CATHEDRAL SERVICES THE NEXT MORNING THERE CAME A LETTER FROM HER
985-126226-0008 WHICH WITH HER USUAL PROMPTITUDE SHE HAD WRITTEN DIRECTLY SHE HAD REACHED HER FRIEND'S HOUSE SHE TOLD HIM OF HER SAFE ARRIVAL AND COMFORTABLE QUARTERS AND THEN ADDED WHAT I REALLY WRITE ABOUT DEAR JUDE IS SOMETHING I SAID TO YOU AT PARTING YOU HAD BEEN SO VERY GOOD AND KIND TO ME
985-126226-0009 THAT WHEN YOU WERE OUT OF SIGHT I FELT WHAT A CRUEL AND UNGRATEFUL WOMAN I WAS TO SAY IT AND IT HAS REPROACHED ME EVER SINCE IF YOU WANT TO LOVE ME JUDE YOU MAY I DON'T MIND AT ALL
985-126226-0010 NOW I WON'T WRITE ANY MORE ABOUT THAT YOU DO FORGIVE YOUR THOUGHTLESS FRIEND FOR HER CRUELTY AND WON'T MAKE HER MISERABLE BY SAYING YOU DON'T EVER SUE IT WOULD BE SUPERFLUOUS TO SAY WHAT HIS ANSWER WAS
985-126226-0011 AND HOW HE THOUGHT WHAT HE WOULD HAVE DONE HAD HE BEEN FREE WHICH SHOULD HAVE RENDERED A LONG RESIDENCE WITH A FEMALE FRIEND QUITE UNNECESSARY FOR SUE HE FELT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PRETTY SURE OF HIS OWN VICTORY IF IT HAD COME TO A CONFLICT BETWEEN PHILLOTSON AND HIMSELF FOR THE POSSESSION OF HER
985-126226-0012 YET JUDE WAS IN DANGER OF ATTACHING MORE MEANING TO SUE'S IMPULSIVE NOTE THAN IT REALLY WAS INTENDED TO BEAR
985-126226-0013 BUT HE RECEIVED NO FURTHER COMMUNICATION AND IN THE INTENSITY OF HIS SOLICITUDE HE SENT ANOTHER NOTE SUGGESTING THAT HE SHOULD PAY HER A VISIT SOME SUNDAY THE DISTANCE BEING UNDER EIGHTEEN MILES HE EXPECTED A REPLY ON THE SECOND MORNING AFTER DESPATCHING HIS MISSIVE BUT NONE CAME
985-126226-0014 THE THIRD MORNING ARRIVED THE POSTMAN DID NOT STOP THIS WAS SATURDAY
985-126226-0015 FOR HE FELT SURE SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED HIS FIRST AND NATURAL THOUGHT HAD BEEN THAT SHE WAS ILL FROM HER IMMERSION
985-126226-0016 CONJECTURES WERE PUT AN END TO BY HIS ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE SCHOOL HOUSE NEAR SHASTON ON THE BRIGHT MORNING OF SUNDAY BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE O'CLOCK WHEN THE PARISH WAS AS VACANT AS A DESERT MOST OF THE INHABITANTS HAVING GATHERED INSIDE THE CHURCH WHENCE THEIR VOICES COULD OCCASIONALLY BE HEARD IN UNISON
985-126226-0017 A LITTLE GIRL OPENED THE DOOR MISS BRIDEHEAD IS UP STAIRS SHE SAID AND WILL YOU PLEASE WALK UP TO HER IS SHE ILL ASKED JUDE HASTILY ONLY A LITTLE NOT VERY JUDE ENTERED AND ASCENDED
985-126226-0018 ON REACHING THE LANDING A VOICE TOLD HIM WHICH WAY TO TURN THE VOICE OF SUE CALLING HIS NAME HE PASSED THE DOORWAY AND FOUND HER LYING IN A LITTLE BED IN A ROOM A DOZEN FEET SQUARE OH SUE HE CRIED SITTING DOWN BESIDE HER AND TAKING HER HAND HOW IS THIS YOU COULDN'T WRITE
985-126226-0019 NO IT WASN'T THAT SHE ANSWERED I DID CATCH A BAD COLD BUT I COULD HAVE WRITTEN ONLY I WOULDN'T WHY NOT FRIGHTENING ME LIKE THIS
985-126226-0020 THEY WON'T HAVE ME BACK AT THE SCHOOL THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T WRITE NOT THE FACT BUT THE REASON WELL THEY NOT ONLY WON'T HAVE ME BUT THEY GAVE ME A PARTING PIECE OF ADVICE WHAT SHE DID NOT ANSWER DIRECTLY
985-126226-0021 IS IT ABOUT US YES BUT DO TELL ME WELL SOMEBODY HAS SENT THEM BASELESS REPORTS ABOUT US AND THEY SAY YOU AND I OUGHT TO MARRY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE FOR THE SAKE OF MY REPUTATION THERE NOW I HAVE TOLD YOU AND I WISH I HADN'T
985-126226-0022 OH POOR SUE I DON'T THINK OF YOU LIKE THAT MEANS IT DID JUST OCCUR TO ME TO REGARD YOU IN THE WAY THEY THINK I DO BUT I HADN'T BEGUN TO I HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT THE COUSINSHIP WAS MERELY NOMINAL SINCE WE MET AS TOTAL STRANGERS BUT MY MARRYING YOU DEAR JUDE
985-126226-0023 AND I NEVER SUPPOSED YOU THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING AS MARRYING ME TILL THE OTHER EVENING WHEN I BEGAN TO FANCY YOU DID LOVE ME A LITTLE PERHAPS I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN SO INTIMATE WITH YOU IT IS ALL MY FAULT EVERYTHING IS MY FAULT ALWAYS
985-126226-0024 THE SPEECH SEEMED A LITTLE FORCED AND UNREAL AND THEY REGARDED EACH OTHER WITH A MUTUAL DISTRESS I WAS SO BLIND AT FIRST SHE WENT ON I DIDN'T SEE WHAT YOU FELT AT ALL OH YOU HAVE BEEN UNKIND TO ME YOU HAVE
985-126226-0025 TO LOOK UPON ME AS A SWEETHEART WITHOUT SAYING A WORD AND LEAVING ME TO DISCOVER IT MYSELF YOUR ATTITUDE TO ME HAS BECOME KNOWN AND NATURALLY THEY THINK WE'VE BEEN DOING WRONG I'LL NEVER TRUST YOU AGAIN YES SUE HE SAID SIMPLY
985-126226-0026 I AM TO BLAME MORE THAN YOU THINK I WAS QUITE AWARE THAT YOU DID NOT SUSPECT TILL WITHIN THE LAST MEETING OR TWO WHAT I WAS FEELING ABOUT YOU I ADMIT THAT OUR MEETING AS STRANGERS PREVENTED A SENSE OF RELATIONSHIP AND THAT IT WAS A SORT OF SUBTERFUGE TO AVAIL MYSELF OF IT
985-126226-0027 BUT DON'T YOU THINK I DESERVE A LITTLE CONSIDERATION FOR CONCEALING MY WRONG VERY WRONG SENTIMENTS SINCE I COULDN'T HELP HAVING THEM SHE TURNED HER EYES DOUBTFULLY TOWARDS HIM AND THEN LOOKED AWAY AS IF AFRAID SHE MIGHT FORGIVE HIM
985-126226-0028 BY EVERY LAW OF NATURE AND SEX A KISS WAS THE ONLY REJOINDER THAT FITTED THE MOOD AND THE MOMENT UNDER THE SUASION OF WHICH SUE'S UNDEMONSTRATIVE REGARD OF HIM MIGHT NOT INCONCEIVABLY HAVE CHANGED ITS TEMPERATURE SOME MEN WOULD HAVE CAST SCRUPLES TO THE WINDS AND VENTURED IT
985-126226-0029 AND OF THE PAIR OF AUTOGRAPHS IN THE VESTRY CHEST OF ARABELLA'S PARISH CHURCH JUDE DID NOT
985-126226-0030 YET AT THE HOUR OF THIS DISTRESS HE COULD NOT DISCLOSE IT HE PREFERRED TO DWELL UPON THE RECOGNIZED BARRIERS BETWEEN THEM OF COURSE I KNOW YOU DON'T
985-126226-0031 PARTICULAR WAY HE SORROWED YOU OUGHT NOT AND YOU ARE RIGHT YOU BELONG TO MISTER PHILLOTSON I SUPPOSE HE HAS BEEN TO SEE YOU YES SHE SAID SHORTLY HER FACE CHANGING A LITTLE THOUGH I DIDN'T ASK HIM TO COME YOU ARE GLAD OF COURSE THAT HE HAS BEEN
985-126226-0032 IT WAS VERY PERPLEXING TO HER LOVER THAT SHE SHOULD BE PIQUED AT HIS HONEST ACQUIESCENCE IN HIS RIVAL IF JUDE'S FEELINGS OF LOVE WERE DEPRECATED BY HER HE WENT ON TO SOMETHING ELSE THIS WILL BLOW OVER DEAR SUE HE SAID
985-126226-0033 THE TRAINING SCHOOL AUTHORITIES ARE NOT ALL THE WORLD YOU CAN GET TO BE A STUDENT IN SOME OTHER NO DOUBT I'LL ASK MISTER PHILLOTSON SHE SAID DECISIVELY SUE'S KIND HOSTESS NOW RETURNED FROM CHURCH AND THERE WAS NO MORE INTIMATE CONVERSATION
985-126226-0034 BUT HE HAD SEEN HER AND SAT WITH HER SUCH INTERCOURSE AS THAT WOULD HAVE TO CONTENT HIM FOR THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE THE LESSON OF RENUNCIATION IT WAS NECESSARY AND PROPER THAT HE AS A PARISH PRIEST SHOULD LEARN
985-126226-0035 BUT THE NEXT MORNING WHEN HE AWOKE HE FELT RATHER VEXED WITH HER AND DECIDED THAT SHE WAS RATHER UNREASONABLE NOT TO SAY CAPRICIOUS
985-126226-0036 THERE CAME PROMPTLY A NOTE WHICH SHE MUST HAVE WRITTEN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY HE HAD GONE FROM HER FORGIVE ME FOR MY PETULANCE YESTERDAY I WAS HORRID TO YOU I KNOW IT AND I FEEL PERFECTLY MISERABLE AT MY HORRIDNESS IT WAS SO DEAR OF YOU NOT TO BE ANGRY JUDE
985-126226-0037 PLEASE STILL KEEP ME AS YOUR FRIEND AND ASSOCIATE WITH ALL MY FAULTS I'LL TRY NOT TO BE LIKE IT AGAIN
985-126226-0038 I COULD WALK WITH YOU FOR HALF AN HOUR IF YOU WOULD LIKE
