2388-153731-0000 AND NOTHING BUT DARK SKY IS VISIBLE AROUND IT EXCEPT FOR THE INTERFERENCE OF THE MOON WE SHOULD PROBABLY NEVER HAVE KNOWN THAT THERE IS ANY MORE OF THE SUN THAN OUR EYES ORDINARILY SEE BUT WHEN AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN OCCURS
2388-153731-0001 MAY BE CALLED THE SUN'S ATMOSPHERE THEY CONSIST OF TWO VERY DIFFERENT PARTS FIRST THE RED PROMINENCES WHICH RESEMBLE TONGUES OF FLAME ASCENDING THOUSANDS OF MILES ABOVE THE SUN'S SURFACE AND SECOND THE CORONA
2388-153731-0002 WHICH EXTENDS TO DISTANCES OF MILLIONS OF MILES FROM THE SUN AND SHINES WITH A SOFT GLOWING LIGHT THE TWO COMBINED WHEN WELL SEEN MAKE A SPECTACLE WITHOUT PARALLEL AMONG THE MARVELS OF THE SKY
2388-153731-0003 ALTHOUGH MANY ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO RENDER THE CORONA VISIBLE WHEN THERE IS NO ECLIPSE ALL HAVE FAILED AND IT IS TO THE MOON ALONE THAT WE OWE ITS REVELATION TO COVER THE SUN'S DISK WITH A CIRCULAR SCREEN
2388-153731-0004 AND THE CORONA APPEARS IN ALL ITS SURPRISING BEAUTY THE PROMINENCES HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THEY WERE DISCOVERED DURING AN ECLIPSE CAN NOW WITH THE AID OF THE SPECTROSCOPE BE SEEN AT ANY TIME BUT THE PROMINENCES ARE RARELY LARGE ENOUGH TO BE NOTICED BY THE NAKED EYE
2388-153731-0005 WHILE THE STREAMERS OF THE CORONA STRETCHING FAR AWAY IN SPACE LIKE GHOSTLY BANNERS BLOWN OUT FROM THE BLACK CIRCLE OF THE OBSCURING MOON ATTRACT EVERY EYE AND TO THIS WEIRD APPARITION MUCH OF THE FEAR INSPIRED BY ECLIPSES HAS BEEN DUE
2388-153731-0006 THE STORY OF THE FIRST SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATION OF THE CORONA AND THE PROMINENCES IS THRILLINGLY INTERESTING AND IN FACT DRAMATIC THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE DURING THE ECLIPSE OF EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO
2388-153731-0007 WHICH FORTUNATELY WAS VISIBLE ALL OVER CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN EUROPE SO THAT SCORES OF ASTRONOMERS SAW IT
2388-153731-0008 WHERE THE ENGLISH ASTRONOMER FRANCIS BAILY HAD SET UP HIS TELESCOPE THE ECLIPSE HAD BEGUN AND BAILEY WAS BUSY AT HIS TELESCOPE WHEN TO QUOTE HIS OWN WORDS IN THE ACCOUNT WHICH HE WROTE FOR THE MEMOIRS OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
2388-153731-0009 WALKING ABOUT THE STREETS AND SQUARES OR LOOKING OUT OF WINDOWS IN ORDER TO WITNESS THIS LONG TALKED OF PHENOMENON AND WHEN THE TOTAL OBSCURATION TOOK PLACE WHICH WAS INSTANTANEOUS THERE WAS A UNIVERSAL SHOUT FROM EVERY OBSERVER WHICH MADE THE WELKIN RING
2388-153731-0010 FROM ANY OF THE ACCOUNTS OF PRECEDING ECLIPSES THAT I HAD READ TO WITNESS SO MAGNIFICENT AN EXHIBITION AS THAT WHICH TOOK PLACE SPLENDID AND ASTONISHING HOWEVER AS THIS REMARKABLE PHENOMENON REALLY WAS
2388-153731-0011 THAT THERE WAS AT THE SAME TIME SOMETHING IN ITS SINGULAR AND WONDERFUL APPEARANCE THAT WAS APPALLING BUT THE MOST REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCE ATTENDING THE PHENOMENON
2388-153731-0012 APPARENTLY EMANATING FROM THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE MOON BUT EVIDENTLY FORMING A PORTION OF THE CORONA
2388-153731-0013 PERHAPS THE COLOR OF THE PEACH BLOSSOM WOULD MORE NEARLY REPRESENT IT
2388-153731-0014 WERE VISIBLE EVEN TO THE LAST MOMENT OF TOTAL OBSCURATION AND WHEN THE FIRST RAY OF LIGHT WAS ADMITTED FROM THE SUN THEY VANISHED WITH THE CORONA ALTOGETHER AND DAYLIGHT WAS INSTANTLY RESTORED I HAVE QUOTED NEARLY ALL OF THIS REMARKABLE DESCRIPTION
2388-153731-0015 NOT ALONE FOR ITS INTRINSIC INTEREST BUT BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST DEPICTION THAT CAN BE FOUND OF THE GENERAL PHENOMENA OF A TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE STILL NOT EVERY SUCH ECLIPSE OFFERS AN EQUALLY MAGNIFICENT SPECTACLE
2388-153731-0016 YET ON BOTH OCCASIONS
2388-153731-0017 THE SOUTH CAROLINIANS GAVE A CHEER AND THE LADIES WAVED THEIR HANDKERCHIEFS WHEN THE CORONA INEFFABLY DELICATE OF FORM AND TEXTURE MELTED INTO SIGHT AND THEN IN TWO MINUTES MELTED AWAY AGAIN THE SPANIARDS
2388-153731-0018 CROWDED ON THE CITADEL HILL OF BURGOS WITH THEIR KING AND HIS ROYAL RETINUE IN THEIR MIDST
2388-153731-0019 THERE ARE RECOGNIZED TWO KINDS OF PROMINENCES THE ERRUPTIVE AND THE QUIESCENT
2388-153731-0020 APPEAR TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SUN SPOTS AND APPEAR ONLY ABOVE THE ZONES WHERE SPOTS ABOUND EITHER OF THEM WHEN SEEN IN PROJECTION AGAINST THE BRILLIANT SOLAR DISK APPEARS WHITE NOT RED AS AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF SKY
2388-153731-0021 THE QUIESCENT PROMINENCES WHOSE ELEVATION IS OFTEN FROM FORTY THOUSAND TO SIXTY THOUSAND MILES CONSIST AS THE SPECTROSCOPE SHOWS MAINLY OF HYDROGEN AND HELIUM THE LATTER IT WILL BE REMEMBERED
2388-153731-0022 IS AN ELEMENT WHICH WAS KNOWN TO BE IN THE SUN MANY YEARS BEFORE THE DISCOVERY THAT IT ALSO EXISTS IN SMALL QUANTITIES ON THE EARTH A FACT WHICH MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANCE WHICH WE CANNOT AT PRESENT SEE
2388-153731-0023 IS THAT THE EMANATION FROM RADIUM GRADUALLY AND SPONTANEOUSLY CHANGES INTO HELIUM AN ALCHEMISTICAL FEAT OF NATURE THAT HAS OPENED MANY CURIOUS VISTAS TO SPECULATIVE THINKERS THE ERUPTIVE PROMINENCES
2388-153731-0024 WHICH DO NOT SPREAD HORIZONTALLY LIKE THE OTHERS BUT ASCEND WITH MARVELOUS VELOCITY TO ELEVATIONS OF HALF A MILLION MILES OR MORE ARE APPARENTLY COMPOSED LARGELY OF METALLIC VAPORS I E METALS
2388-153731-0025 BUT WHICH AT SOLAR TEMPERATURES ARE KEPT IN A VOLATILIZED STATE THE VELOCITY OF THEIR ASCENT OCCASIONALLY AMOUNTS TO THREE HUNDRED OR FOUR HUNDRED MILES PER SECOND IT IS KNOWN FROM MATHEMATICAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT THE GRAVITATION OF THE SUN
2388-153731-0026 SO IT IS EVIDENT THAT SOME OF THE MATTER HURLED FORTH IN ERUPTIVE PROMINENCES MAY ESCAPE FROM SOLAR CONTROL AND GO SPEEDING OUT INTO SPACE COOLING AND CONDENSING INTO SOLID MASSES
2388-153731-0027 MIGHT NOT REACH THE PLANETS HERE THEN WE HAVE ON A RELATIVELY SMALL SCALE EXPLOSIONS
2388-153731-0028 BUT THEY EVIDENTLY HAVE AN INTIMATE CONNECTION WITH ERUPTIVE PROMINENCES
2388-153731-0029 EVIDENCES OF A CYCLONIC TENDENCY HAVE BEEN FOUND
2388-153731-0030 MIRA CETI A STAR WHICH EVERY ELEVEN MONTHS OR THEREABOUT FLAMES UP WITH GREAT BRILLIANCY
2388-153731-0031 THE ASSOCIATION OF THE CORONA WITH SUN SPOTS IS LESS EVIDENT THAN THAT OF THE ERUPTIVE PROMINENCES STILL SUCH AN ASSOCIATION EXISTS FOR THE FORM AND EXTENT OF THE CORONA VARY WITH THE SUN SPOT PERIOD OF WHICH WE SHALL PRESENTLY SPEAK
