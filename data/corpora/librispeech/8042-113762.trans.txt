8042-113762-0000 SPICED WINES AND FRUITS AND RARE MEATS THE GUESTS WHITE ROBED ANOINTED AND PERFUMED TAKE THEIR PLACES MUSIC THE JESTS EVOKE ROARS OF LAUGHTER RIDDLES ARE PROPOUNDED REPARTEES INDULGED TOASTS DRUNK THE BRAIN BEFOGGED

8042-113762-0002 STAND BACK AND GIVE PLENTY OF ROOM FOR THE GYRATIONS THE LORDS ARE ENCHANTED THEY NEVER SAW SUCH POETRY OF MOTION
8042-113762-0003 HEROD FORGETS CROWN AND THRONE
8042-113762-0004 HE SWAYS WITH EVERY MOTION OF THE ENCHANTRESS HE THRILLS WITH THE QUICK PULSATIONS OF HER FEET AND IS BEWITCHED WITH THE POSTURING AND ATTITUDES THAT HE NEVER SAW BEFORE IN A MOMENT EXCHANGED FOR OTHERS JUST AS AMAZING HE SITS IN SILENCE BEFORE THE WHIRLING BOUNDING LEAPING FLASHING WONDER
8042-113762-0005 WHATSOEVER THOU SHALT ASK OF ME I WILL GIVE IT TO THEE TO THE HALF OF MY KINGDOM NOW THERE WAS IN PRISON A MINISTER BY THE NAME OF JOHN THE BAPTIST WHO HAD MADE MUCH TROUBLE BY HIS HONEST PREACHING HE HAD DENOUNCED THE SINS OF THE KING
8042-113762-0006 AND BROUGHT DOWN UPON HIMSELF THE WRATH OF THE FEMALES IN THE ROYAL FAMILY AT THE INSTIGATION OF HER MOTHER SALOME TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE KING'S EXTRAVAGANT PROMISE AND DEMANDS THE HEAD OF JOHN THE BAPTIST ON A DINNER PLATE THERE IS A SOUND OF HEAVY FEET
8042-113762-0007 SWING BACK THE DOOR THE EXECUTIONERS ARE RETURNING FROM THEIR AWFUL ERRAND THEY HAND A PLATTER TO SALOME WHAT IS THAT ON THE PLATTER
8042-113762-0008 NO IT IS REDDER THAN WINE AND COSTLIER IT IS THE GHASTLY BLEEDING HEAD OF JOHN THE BAPTIST ITS LOCKS DABBLED IN GORE ITS EYES SET IN THE DEATH STARE THE DISTRESS OF THE LAST AGONY IN THE FEATURES THAT FASCINATING FORM
8042-113762-0009 THAT JUST NOW SWAYED SO GRACEFULLY IN THE DANCE BENDS OVER THE HORRID BURDEN WITHOUT A SHUDDER SHE GLOATS OVER THE BLOOD AND JUST AS THE MAID OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD GOES BEARING OUT ON A TRAY THE EMPTY GLASSES OF THE EVENING'S ENTERTAINMENT SO SHE CARRIED OUT ON A PLATTER THE DISSEVERED HEAD OF THAT GOOD MAN
8042-113762-0010 AND WHO SEEM TO THINK THAT EVERYTHING DECENT AND IMMORTAL DEPENDS UPON THE STYLE IN WHICH PEOPLE CARRY THEIR FEET ON THE OTHER HAND I CAN SEE NOTHING BUT RUIN MORAL AND PHYSICAL IN THE DISSIPATIONS OF THE BALL ROOM WHICH HAVE DESPOILED THOUSANDS OF YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN OF ALL THAT GIVES DIGNITY TO CHARACTER OR USEFULNESS TO LIFE
8042-113762-0011 DANCING HAS BEEN STYLED THE GRACEFUL MOVEMENT OF THE BODY ADJUSTED BY ART TO THE MEASURES OR TUNE OF INSTRUMENTS OR OF THE VOICE
8042-113762-0012 IN OTHER DAYS THERE WERE FESTAL DANCES AND FUNERAL DANCES AND MILITARY DANCES AND MEDIATORIAL DANCES AND BACCHANALIAN DANCES QUEENS AND LORDS HAVE SWAYED TO AND FRO IN THEIR GARDENS AND THE ROUGH MEN OF THE BACKWOODS IN THIS WAY HAVE ROUSED UP THE ECHO OF THE FOREST
8042-113762-0013 IT IS THEREFORE NO ABSTRACT QUESTION THAT YOU ASK ME IS IT RIGHT TO DANCE THE ANCIENT FATHERS AROUSED BY THE INDECENT DANCES OF THOSE DAYS GAVE EMPHATIC EVIDENCE AGAINST ANY PARTICIPATION IN THE DANCE SAINT CHRYSOSTOM SAYS
8042-113762-0014 THE FEET WERE NOT GIVEN FOR DANCING BUT TO WALK MODESTLY NOT TO LEAP IMPUDENTLY LIKE CAMELS ONE OF THE DOGMAS OF THE ANCIENT CHURCH READS A DANCE IS THE DEVIL'S POSSESSION AND HE THAT ENTERETH INTO A DANCE ENTERETH INTO HIS POSSESSION
8042-113762-0015 THE DEVIL IS THE GATE TO THE MIDDLE AND TO THE END OF THE DANCE AS MANY PASSES AS A MAN MAKES IN DANCING SO MANY PASSES DOTH HE MAKE TO HELL ELSEWHERE THESE OLD DOGMAS DECLARE THE WOMAN THAT SINGETH IN THE DANCE IS THE PRINCESS OF THE DEVIL
8042-113762-0016 SO THE DEVIL CALLETH ONE WOMAN TO SING IN THE DANCE OR TO PLAY ON SOME INSTRUMENT AND PRESENTLY ALL THE DANCERS GATHER TOGETHER THIS WHOLESALE AND INDISCRIMINATE DENUNCIATION GREW OUT OF THE UTTER DISSOLUTENESS OF THOSE ANCIENT PLAYS
8042-113762-0017 SO GREAT AT ONE TIME WAS THE OFFENCE TO ALL DECENCY THAT THE ROMAN SENATE DECREED THE EXPULSION OF ALL DANCERS AND DANCING MASTERS FROM ROME YET WE ARE NOT TO DISCUSS THE CUSTOMS OF THAT DAY BUT THE CUSTOMS OF THE PRESENT WE CANNOT LET THE FATHERS DECIDE THE QUESTION FOR US
8042-113762-0018 OUR REASON ENLIGHTENED BY THE BIBLE SHALL BE THE STANDARD I AM NOT READY TO EXCOMMUNICATE ALL THOSE WHO LIFT THEIR FEET BEYOND A CERTAIN HEIGHT I WOULD NOT VISIT OUR YOUTH WITH A RIGOR OF CRITICISM THAT WOULD PUT OUT ALL THEIR ARDOR OF SOUL
8042-113762-0019 WENT DOWN TO RUIN I WOULD GIVE TO ALL OF OUR YOUTH THE RIGHT TO ROMP AND PLAY GOD MEANT IT OR HE WOULD NOT HAVE SURCHARGED OUR NATURES WITH SUCH EXUBERANCE
8042-113762-0020 I SEE NO HARM I FOR A LONG WHILE TRIED TO SEE IN IT A HARM
8042-113762-0021 I WOULD TO GOD MEN KEPT YOUNG FOR A GREATER LENGTH OF TIME NEVER SINCE MY SCHOOL BOY DAYS HAVE I LOVED SO WELL AS NOW THE HILARITIES OF LIFE WHAT IF WE HAVE FELT HEAVY BURDENS AND SUFFERED A MULTITUDE OF HARD KNOCKS
8042-113762-0022 LET ME TELL YOU THAT YOU WILL BE TREATED A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN YOU DESERVE LET US NOT GRUDGE TO THE YOUNG THEIR JOY AS WE GO FURTHER ON IN LIFE LET US GO WITH THE REMEMBRANCE THAT WE HAVE HAD OUR GLEEFUL DAYS WHEN OLD AGE FROSTS OUR LOCKS AND STIFFENS OUR LIMBS
8042-113762-0023 THEN LET OUR CHILDREN COME ON AND WE'LL HAVE IT THEIR WAY FOR THIRTY FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS WE HAVE BEEN DRINKING FROM THE CUP OF LIFE
8042-113762-0024 THEY SWING AN AWFUL SCYTHE OF DEATH
8042-113762-0025 THE DEFILER OF THE SOUL THE AVENUE OF LUST AND THE CURSE OF THE TOWN THE TREAD OF THIS WILD INTOXICATING HEATED MIDNIGHT DANCE JARS ALL THE MORAL HEARTHSTONES OF THE CITY THE PHYSICAL RUIN IS EVIDENT WHAT WILL BECOME OF THOSE WHO WORK ALL DAY AND DANCE ALL NIGHT
8042-113762-0026 A FEW YEARS WILL TURN THEM OUT NERVOUS EXHAUSTED IMBECILES THOSE WHO HAVE GIVEN UP THEIR MIDNIGHTS TO SPICED WINES AND HOT SUPPERS AND RIDE HOME THROUGH WINTER'S COLD UNWRAPPED FROM THE ELEMENTS WILL AT LAST BE RECORDED SUICIDES
8042-113762-0027 THERE ARE CONSUMPTIONS AND FIERCE NEURALGIAS CLOSE ON THE TRACK AMID THAT GLITTERING MAZE OF BALL ROOM SPLENDORS DISEASES STAND RIGHT AND LEFT AND BALANCE AND CHAIN A SEPULCHRAL BREATH
8042-113762-0028 MANY OF OUR BRIGHTEST HOMES ARE BEING SACRIFICED THERE ARE FAMILIES THAT HAVE ACTUALLY QUIT KEEPING HOUSE AND GONE TO BOARDING THAT THEY MAY GIVE THEMSELVES MORE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE HIGHER DUTIES OF THE BALL ROOM
8042-113762-0029 THE SON WILL BE TOSSED ABOUT IN SOCIETY A NONENTITY THE DAUGHTER WILL ELOPE WITH A FRENCH DANCING MASTER THE MOTHER STILL TRYING TO STAY IN THE GLITTER AND BY EVERY ART ATTEMPTING TO KEEP THE COLOR IN HER CHEEK AND THE WRINKLES OFF HER BROW ATTEMPTING WITHOUT ANY SUCCESS ALL THE ARTS OF THE BELLE
8042-113762-0030 AN OLD FLIRT A POOR MISERABLE BUTTERFLY WITHOUT ANY WINGS IF ANYTHING ON THE EARTH IS BEAUTIFUL TO MY EYE IT IS AN AGED WOMAN
8042-113762-0031 HER VOICE TENDER WITH PAST MEMORIES AND HER FACE A BENEDICTION
8042-113762-0032 WHEN SHE GOES AWAY FROM US THERE IS A SHADOW ON THE TABLE A SHADOW ON THE HEARTH AND A SHADOW IN THE DWELLING BUT IF ANYTHING ON EARTH IS DISTRESSFUL TO LOOK AT IT IS AN OLD WOMAN ASHAMED OF BEING OLD
8042-113762-0033 I LAUGH EVEN IN CHURCH WHEN I SEE HER COMING ONE OF THE WORST LOOKING BIRDS I KNOW OF IS A PEACOCK AFTER IT HAS LOST ITS FEATHERS I WOULD NOT GIVE ONE LOCK OF MY MOTHER'S GRAY HAIR FOR FIFTY THOUSAND SUCH CARICATURES OF OLD AGE
8042-113762-0034 THESE CREATURES HAVE NO HOME THEIR CHILDREN UNWASHED THEIR FURNITURE UNDUSTED THEIR CHINA CLOSETS DISORDERED THE HOUSE A SCENE OF CONFUSION MISRULE CHEERLESSNESS AND DIRT
8042-113762-0035 ONE WOULD THINK YOU MIGHT DISCOVER EVEN AMID THE WITCHERIES OF THE BALL ROOM THE SICKENING ODORS OF THE UNSWEPT UNVENTILATED AND UNCLEAN DOMESTIC APARTMENTS THESE DISSIPATIONS EXTINGUISH ALL LOVE OF USEFULNESS
8042-113762-0036 HOW COULD YOU EXPECT ONE TO BE INTERESTED IN THE ALLEVIATIONS OF THE WORLD'S MISERY WHILE THERE IS A QUESTION TO BE DECIDED ABOUT THE SIZE OF A GLOVE OR THE SHADE OF A PONGEE HOW MANY OF THESE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE BALL ROOM VISIT THE POOR
8042-113762-0037 WHEN DID THE WORLD EVER SEE A PERPETUAL DANCER DISTRIBUTING TRACTS SUCH PERSONS ARE TURNED IN UPON THEMSELVES AND IT IS VERY POOR PASTURE THIS GILDED SPHERE IS UTTERLY BEDWARFING TO INTELLECT AND SOUL THIS CONSTANT STUDY OF LITTLE THINGS
8042-113762-0038 THIS HARASSING ANXIETY ABOUT DRESS THIS TALK OF FASHIONABLE INFINITESIMALS THIS SHOE PINCHED HAIR FRIZZLED FRINGE SPATTERED GROUP THAT SIMPER AND LOOK ASKANCE AT THE MIRRORS AND WONDER WITH INFINITY OF INTEREST HOW THAT ONE GERANIUM LEAF DOES LOOK
8042-113762-0039 THIS SHRIVELLING UP OF MAN'S MORAL DIGNITY UNTIL IT IS NO MORE OBSERVABLE WITH THE NAKED EYE THIS TAKING OF A WOMAN'S HEART THAT GOD MEANT SHOULD BE FILLED WITH ALL AMENITIES AND COMPRESSING IT UNTIL ALL THE FRAGRANCE AND SIMPLICITY AND ARTLESSNESS ARE SQUEEZED OUT OF IT THIS INQUISITION OF A SMALL SHOE
8042-113762-0040 THIS AGONY OF TIGHT LACING THIS WRAPPING UP OF MIND AND HEART IN A RUFFLE THIS TUMBLING DOWN OF A SOUL THAT GOD MEANT FOR GREAT UPLIFTINGS
8042-113762-0041 HAVE THE WHITE POLISHED GLISTENING BOARDS EVER BEEN THE ROAD TO HEAVEN WHO AT THE FLASH OF THOSE CHANDELIERS HATH KINDLED A TORCH FOR ETERNITY FROM THE TABLE SPREAD AT THE CLOSE OF THAT EXCITED AND BESWEATED SCENE WHO WENT HOME TO SAY HIS PRAYERS TO MANY ALAS THIS LIFE IS A MASQUERADE BALL
8042-113762-0042 AS AT SUCH ENTERTAINMENTS GENTLEMEN AND LADIES APPEAR IN THE DRESS OF KINGS OR QUEENS MOUNTAIN BANDITS OR CLOWNS AND AT THE CLOSE OF THE DANCE THROW OFF THEIR DISGUISES SO IN THIS DISSIPATED LIFE ALL UNCLEAN PASSIONS MOVE IN MASK ACROSS THE FLOOR THEY TRIP MERRILY
8042-113762-0043 GLEAMING BROW BENDS LOW TO GLEAMING BROW ON WITH THE DANCE FLASH AND RUSTLE AND LAUGHTER AND IMMEASURABLE MERRY MAKING BUT THE LANGUOR OF DEATH COMES OVER THE LIMBS AND BLURS THE SIGHT LIGHTS LOWER
8042-113762-0044 MUSIC SADDENS INTO A WAIL LIGHTS LOWER
8042-113762-0045 LIGHTS LOWER MISTS FILL THE ROOM GLASSES RATTLE AS THOUGH SHAKEN BY SULLEN THUNDER SIGHS SEEM CAUGHT AMONG THE CURTAINS SCARF FALLS FROM THE SHOULDER OF BEAUTY A SHROUD LIGHTS LOWER
8042-113762-0046 OVER THE SLIPPERY BOARDS IN DANCE OF DEATH GLIDE JEALOUSIES DISAPPOINTMENTS LUST DESPAIR TORN LEAVES AND WITHERED GARLANDS ONLY HALF HIDE THE ULCERED FEET THE STENCH OF SMOKING LAMP WICKS ALMOST QUENCHED CHOKING DAMPS CHILLINESS FEET STILL
8042-113762-0047 HANDS FOLDED EYES SHUT VOICES HUSHED
