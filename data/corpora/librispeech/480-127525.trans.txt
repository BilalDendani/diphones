480-127525-0000 NARRATIVE CONTINUED BY THE DOCTOR THE JOLLY BOAT'S LAST TRIP THIS FIFTH TRIP WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ANY OF THE OTHERS IN THE FIRST PLACE
480-127525-0001 THE LITTLE GALLIPOT OF A BOAT THAT WE WERE IN WAS GRAVELY OVERLOADED FIVE GROWN MEN AND THREE OF THEM TRELAWNEY REDRUTH AND THE CAPTAIN OVER SIX FEET HIGH
480-127525-0002 WAS ALREADY MORE THAN SHE WAS MEANT TO CARRY ADD TO THAT THE POWDER PORK AND BREAD BAGS THE GUNWALE WAS LIPPING ASTERN
480-127525-0003 SEVERAL TIMES WE SHIPPED A LITTLE WATER AND MY BREECHES AND THE TAILS OF MY COAT WERE ALL SOAKING WET BEFORE WE HAD GONE A HUNDRED YARDS THE CAPTAIN MADE US TRIM THE BOAT
480-127525-0004 AND WE GOT HER TO LIE A LITTLE MORE EVENLY ALL THE SAME WE WERE AFRAID TO BREATHE IN THE SECOND PLACE THE EBB WAS NOW MAKING A STRONG RIPPLING CURRENT
480-127525-0005 RUNNING WESTWARD THROUGH THE BASIN AND THEN SOUTH'ARD AND SEAWARD DOWN THE STRAITS BY WHICH WE HAD ENTERED IN THE MORNING EVEN THE RIPPLES WERE A DANGER TO OUR OVERLOADED CRAFT
480-127525-0006 TWO FRESH MEN WERE AT THE OARS THE TIDE KEEPS WASHING HER DOWN COULD YOU PULL A LITTLE STRONGER NOT WITHOUT SWAMPING THE BOAT SAID HE YOU MUST BEAR UP SIR
480-127525-0007 IF YOU PLEASE BEAR UP UNTIL YOU SEE YOU'RE GAINING I TRIED AND FOUND BY EXPERIMENT THAT THE TIDE KEPT SWEEPING US WESTWARD UNTIL I HAD LAID HER HEAD DUE EAST
480-127525-0008 OR JUST ABOUT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE WAY WE OUGHT TO GO WE'LL NEVER GET ASHORE AT THIS RATE SAID I IF IT'S THE ONLY COURSE THAT WE CAN LIE SIR WE MUST EVEN LIE IT
480-127525-0009 RETURNED THE CAPTAIN WE MUST KEEP UPSTREAM YOU SEE SIR HE WENT ON IF ONCE WE DROPPED TO LEEWARD OF THE LANDING PLACE IT'S HARD TO SAY WHERE WE SHOULD GET ASHORE
480-127525-0010 BESIDES THE CHANCE OF BEING BOARDED BY THE GIGS WHEREAS THE WAY WE GO THE CURRENT MUST SLACKEN AND THEN WE CAN DODGE BACK ALONG THE SHORE
480-127525-0011 FOR WE HAD ALL QUIETLY MADE UP OUR MINDS TO TREAT HIM LIKE ONE OF OURSELVES SUDDENLY THE CAPTAIN SPOKE UP AGAIN AND I THOUGHT HIS VOICE WAS A LITTLE CHANGED
480-127525-0012 THE GUN SAID HE I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT SAID I FOR I MADE SURE HE WAS THINKING OF A BOMBARDMENT OF THE FORT THEY COULD NEVER GET THE GUN ASHORE
480-127525-0013 WE PUT THE BOAT'S HEAD DIRECT FOR THE LANDING PLACE BY THIS TIME WE HAD GOT SO FAR OUT OF THE RUN OF THE CURRENT THAT WE KEPT STEERAGE WAY EVEN AT OUR NECESSARILY GENTLE RATE OF ROWING
480-127525-0014 AND OFFERED A TARGET LIKE A BARN DOOR I COULD HEAR AS WELL AS SEE THAT BRANDY FACED RASCAL ISRAEL
480-127525-0015 MISTER TRELAWNEY WILL YOU PLEASE PICK ME OFF ONE OF THESE MEN SIR HANDS IF POSSIBLE SAID THE CAPTAIN
480-127525-0016 TRELAWNEY WAS AS COOL AS STEEL HE LOOKED TO THE PRIMING OF HIS GUN NOW CRIED THE CAPTAIN EASY WITH THAT GUN SIR OR YOU'LL SWAMP THE BOAT
480-127525-0017 ALL HANDS STAND BY TO TRIM HER WHEN HE AIMS THE SQUIRE RAISED HIS GUN THE ROWING CEASED
480-127525-0018 WAS IN CONSEQUENCE THE MOST EXPOSED HOWEVER WE HAD NO LUCK FOR JUST AS TRELAWNEY FIRED DOWN HE STOOPED THE BALL WHISTLED OVER HIM
480-127525-0019 AND IT WAS ONE OF THE OTHER FOUR WHO FELL THE CRY HE GAVE WAS ECHOED NOT ONLY BY HIS COMPANIONS ON BOARD BUT BY A GREAT NUMBER OF VOICES FROM THE SHORE
480-127525-0020 AND LOOKING IN THAT DIRECTION I SAW THE OTHER PIRATES TROOPING OUT FROM AMONG THE TREES AND TUMBLING INTO THEIR PLACES IN THE BOATS
480-127525-0021 GIVE WAY THEN CRIED THE CAPTAIN WE MUSTN'T MIND IF WE SWAMP HER NOW IF WE CAN'T GET ASHORE ALL'S UP ONLY ONE OF THE GIGS IS BEING MANNED SIR
480-127525-0022 I ADDED THE CREW OF THE OTHER MOST LIKELY GOING ROUND BY SHORE TO CUT US OFF THEY'LL HAVE A HOT RUN SIR RETURNED THE CAPTAIN
480-127525-0023 JACK ASHORE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THEM I MIND IT'S THE ROUND SHOT CARPET BOWLS MY LADY'S MAID COULDN'T MISS TELL US SQUIRE
480-127525-0024 WHEN YOU SEE THE MATCH AND WE'LL HOLD WATER IN THE MEANWHILE WE HAD BEEN MAKING HEADWAY AT A GOOD PACE FOR A BOAT SO OVERLOADED AND WE HAD SHIPPED
480-127525-0025 BELOW THE CLUSTERING TREES THE GIG WAS NO LONGER TO BE FEARED THE LITTLE POINT HAD ALREADY CONCEALED IT FROM OUR EYES THE EBB TIDE WHICH HAD SO CRUELLY DELAYED US
480-127525-0026 AND DELAYING OUR ASSAILANTS THE ONE SOURCE OF DANGER WAS THE GUN IF I DURST SAID THE CAPTAIN I'D STOP AND PICK OFF ANOTHER MAN
480-127525-0027 BUT IT WAS PLAIN THAT THEY MEANT NOTHING SHOULD DELAY THEIR SHOT THEY HAD NEVER SO MUCH AS LOOKED AT THEIR FALLEN COMRADE THOUGH HE WAS NOT DEAD
480-127525-0028 BACKED WITH A GREAT HEAVE THAT SENT HER STERN BODILY UNDER WATER THE REPORT FELL IN AT THE SAME INSTANT OF TIME THIS WAS THE FIRST THAT JIM HEARD THE SOUND OF THE SQUIRE'S SHOT
480-127525-0029 NOT HAVING REACHED HIM WHERE THE BALL PASSED NOT ONE OF US PRECISELY KNEW BUT I FANCY IT MUST HAVE BEEN OVER OUR HEADS AND THAT THE WIND OF IT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO OUR DISASTER
480-127525-0030 ON OUR FEET THE OTHER THREE TOOK COMPLETE HEADERS AND CAME UP AGAIN DRENCHED AND BUBBLING SO FAR THERE WAS NO GREAT HARM NO LIVES WERE LOST
480-127525-0031 AND WE COULD WADE ASHORE IN SAFETY BUT THERE WERE ALL OUR STORES AT THE BOTTOM AND TO MAKE THINGS WORSE
480-127525-0032 AS FOR THE CAPTAIN HE HAD CARRIED HIS OVER HIS SHOULDER BY A BANDOLEER AND LIKE A WISE MAN LOCK UPPERMOST THE OTHER THREE HAD GONE DOWN WITH THE BOAT
480-127525-0033 TO ADD TO OUR CONCERN
480-127525-0034 HUNTER WAS STEADY THAT WE KNEW JOYCE WAS A DOUBTFUL CASE A PLEASANT POLITE MAN FOR A VALET
480-127525-0035 AND TO BRUSH ONE'S CLOTHES BUT NOT ENTIRELY FITTED FOR A MAN OF WAR WITH ALL THIS IN OUR MINDS WE WADED ASHORE AS FAST AS WE COULD LEAVING BEHIND US
