4592-22179-0000 IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE PIERRE COULD FALL ASLEEP THAT NIGHT HE PACED UP AND DOWN HIS ROOM
4592-22179-0001 NOW SUDDENLY SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS AND WINCING AND NOW SMILING HAPPILY HE WAS THINKING OF PRINCE ANDREW OF NATASHA AND OF THEIR LOVE AT ONE MOMENT JEALOUS OF HER PAST THEN REPROACHING HIMSELF FOR THAT FEELING
4592-22179-0002 IT WAS ALREADY SIX IN THE MORNING AND HE STILL PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM WELL WHAT'S TO BE DONE IF IT CANNOT BE AVOIDED WHAT'S TO BE DONE EVIDENTLY IT HAS TO BE SO SAID HE TO HIMSELF AND HASTILY UNDRESSING HE GOT INTO BED
4592-22179-0003 HAPPY AND AGITATED BUT FREE FROM HESITATION OR INDECISION STRANGE AND IMPOSSIBLE AS SUCH HAPPINESS SEEMS I MUST DO EVERYTHING THAT SHE AND I MAY BE MAN AND WIFE HE TOLD HIMSELF A FEW DAYS PREVIOUSLY PIERRE HAD DECIDED TO GO TO PETERSBURG ON THE FRIDAY
4592-22179-0004 WHAT TO PETERSBURG WHAT IS PETERSBURG WHO IS THERE IN PETERSBURG HE ASKED INVOLUNTARILY THOUGH ONLY TO HIMSELF OH YES LONG AGO BEFORE THIS HAPPENED I DID FOR SOME REASON MEAN TO GO TO PETERSBURG HE REFLECTED WHY
4592-22179-0005 BUT PERHAPS I SHALL GO WHAT A GOOD FELLOW HE IS AND HOW ATTENTIVE AND HOW HE REMEMBERS EVERYTHING HE THOUGHT
4592-22179-0006 AND WHAT A PLEASANT SMILE HE HAS
4592-22179-0007 DO YOU STILL NOT WISH TO ACCEPT YOUR FREEDOM PIERRE ASKED HIM WHAT'S THE GOOD OF FREEDOM TO ME YOUR EXCELLENCY WE LIVED UNDER THE LATE COUNT THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN BE HIS AND WE HAVE LIVED UNDER YOU TOO WITHOUT EVER BEING WRONGED
4592-22179-0008 AND YOUR CHILDREN THE CHILDREN WILL LIVE JUST THE SAME WITH SUCH MASTERS ONE CAN LIVE BUT WHAT ABOUT MY HEIRS SAID PIERRE SUPPOSING I SUDDENLY MARRY IT MIGHT HAPPEN HE ADDED WITH AN INVOLUNTARY SMILE
4592-22179-0009 IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING HOW EASY HE THINKS IT THOUGHT PIERRE HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TERRIBLE IT IS AND HOW DANGEROUS TOO SOON OR TOO LATE IT IS TERRIBLE
4592-22179-0010 NO I'LL PUT IT OFF FOR A BIT I'LL TELL YOU LATER YOU MUST FORGIVE THE TROUBLE I HAVE PUT YOU TO SAID PIERRE AND SEEING SAVELICH SMILE HE THOUGHT
4592-22179-0011 BUT PROBABLY HE KNOWS IT WELL ENOUGH AND IS ONLY PRETENDING SHALL I HAVE A TALK WITH HIM AND SEE WHAT HE THINKS PIERRE REFLECTED NO ANOTHER TIME AT BREAKFAST PIERRE TOLD THE PRINCESS HIS COUSIN THAT HE HAD BEEN TO SEE PRINCESS MARY THE DAY BEFORE
4592-22179-0012 AND HAD THERE MET WHOM DO YOU THINK NATASHA ROSTOVA
4592-22179-0013 DO YOU KNOW HER ASKED PIERRE
4592-22179-0014 THAT THEY WERE ARRANGING A MATCH FOR HER WITH YOUNG ROSTOV IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING FOR THE ROSTOVS THEY ARE SAID TO BE UTTERLY RUINED NO I MEAN DO YOU KNOW NATASHA ROSTOVA
4592-22179-0015 I HEARD ABOUT THAT AFFAIR OF HERS AT THE TIME IT WAS A GREAT PITY NO SHE EITHER DOESN'T UNDERSTAND OR IS PRETENDING THOUGHT PIERRE BETTER NOT SAY ANYTHING TO HER EITHER THE PRINCESS TOO HAD PREPARED PROVISIONS FOR PIERRE'S JOURNEY
4592-22179-0016 HOW KIND THEY ALL ARE THOUGHT PIERRE
4592-22179-0017 AND ALL FOR ME ON THE SAME DAY THE CHIEF OF POLICE CAME TO PIERRE INVITING HIM TO SEND A REPRESENTATIVE TO THE FACETED PALACE TO RECOVER THINGS THAT WERE TO BE RETURNED TO THEIR OWNERS THAT DAY
4592-22179-0018 AND THIS MAN TOO THOUGHT PIERRE LOOKING INTO THE FACE OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE WHAT A FINE GOOD LOOKING OFFICER AND HOW KIND FANCY BOTHERING ABOUT SUCH TRIFLES NOW AND THEY ACTUALLY SAY HE IS NOT HONEST AND TAKES BRIBES WHAT NONSENSE
4592-22179-0019 THAT'S THE WAY HE WAS BROUGHT UP AND EVERYBODY DOES IT BUT WHAT A KIND PLEASANT FACE AND HOW HE SMILES AS HE LOOKS AT ME PIERRE WENT TO PRINCESS MARY'S TO DINNER
4592-22179-0020 AS HE DROVE THROUGH THE STREETS PAST THE HOUSES THAT HAD BEEN BURNED DOWN HE WAS SURPRISED BY THE BEAUTY OF THOSE RUINS THE PICTURESQUENESS OF THE CHIMNEY STACKS AND TUMBLE DOWN WALLS OF THE BURNED OUT QUARTERS OF THE TOWN
4592-22179-0021 STRETCHING OUT AND CONCEALING ONE ANOTHER REMINDED HIM OF THE RHINE AND THE COLOSSEUM THE CABMEN HE MET AND THEIR PASSENGERS THE CARPENTERS CUTTING THE TIMBER FOR NEW HOUSES WITH AXES
4592-22179-0022 ALL LOOKED AT HIM WITH CHEERFUL BEAMING EYES THAT SEEMED TO SAY
4592-22179-0023 THERE HE IS LET'S SEE WHAT WILL COME OF IT
4592-22179-0024 AND REALLY SEEN NATASHA AND TALKED TO HER PERHAPS I IMAGINED IT PERHAPS I SHALL GO IN AND FIND NO ONE THERE BUT HE HAD HARDLY ENTERED THE ROOM BEFORE HE FELT HER PRESENCE WITH HIS WHOLE BEING BY THE LOSS OF HIS SENSE OF FREEDOM
4592-22179-0025 SHE WAS IN THE SAME BLACK DRESS WITH SOFT FOLDS AND HER HAIR WAS DONE THE SAME WAY AS THE DAY BEFORE YET SHE WAS QUITE DIFFERENT HAD SHE BEEN LIKE THIS WHEN HE ENTERED THE DAY BEFORE HE COULD NOT FOR A MOMENT HAVE FAILED TO RECOGNIZE HER
4592-22179-0026 SHE WAS AS HE HAD KNOWN HER ALMOST AS A CHILD AND LATER ON AS PRINCE ANDREW'S FIANCEE A BRIGHT QUESTIONING LIGHT SHONE IN HER EYES AND ON HER FACE WAS A FRIENDLY AND STRANGELY ROGUISH EXPRESSION
4592-22179-0027 THOUGH PRINCESS MARY AND NATASHA WERE EVIDENTLY GLAD TO SEE THEIR VISITOR AND THOUGH ALL PIERRE'S INTEREST WAS NOW CENTERED IN THAT HOUSE BY THE EVENING THEY HAD TALKED OVER EVERYTHING AND THE CONVERSATION PASSED FROM ONE TRIVIAL TOPIC TO ANOTHER AND REPEATEDLY BROKE OFF
4592-22179-0028 HE STAYED SO LONG THAT PRINCESS MARY AND NATASHA EXCHANGED GLANCES EVIDENTLY WONDERING WHEN HE WOULD GO PIERRE NOTICED THIS BUT COULD NOT GO HE FELT UNEASY AND EMBARRASSED BUT SAT ON BECAUSE HE SIMPLY COULD NOT GET UP AND TAKE HIS LEAVE
4592-22179-0029 PRINCESS MARY FORESEEING NO END TO THIS ROSE FIRST AND COMPLAINING OF A HEADACHE BEGAN TO SAY GOOD NIGHT SO YOU ARE GOING TO PETERSBURG TOMORROW SHE ASKED
4592-22179-0030 YES NO TO PETERSBURG TOMORROW BUT I WON'T SAY GOOD BY YET I WILL CALL ROUND IN CASE YOU HAVE ANY COMMISSIONS FOR ME SAID HE STANDING BEFORE PRINCESS MARY AND TURNING RED BUT NOT TAKING HIS DEPARTURE
4592-22179-0031 NATASHA GAVE HIM HER HAND AND WENT OUT PRINCESS MARY ON THE OTHER HAND INSTEAD OF GOING AWAY SANK INTO AN ARMCHAIR AND LOOKED STERNLY AND INTENTLY AT HIM WITH HER DEEP RADIANT EYES
4592-22179-0032 THE WEARINESS SHE HAD PLAINLY SHOWN BEFORE HAD NOW QUITE PASSED OFF WITH A DEEP AND LONG DRAWN SIGH SHE SEEMED TO BE PREPARED FOR A LENGTHY TALK
4592-22179-0033 WHEN NATASHA LEFT THE ROOM PIERRE'S CONFUSION AND AWKWARDNESS IMMEDIATELY VANISHED AND WERE REPLACED BY EAGER EXCITEMENT HE QUICKLY MOVED AN ARMCHAIR TOWARD PRINCESS MARY YES I WANTED TO TELL YOU SAID HE ANSWERING HER LOOK AS IF SHE HAD SPOKEN
4592-22179-0034 PRINCESS HELP ME WHAT AM I TO DO CAN I HOPE PRINCESS MY DEAR FRIEND LISTEN
4592-22179-0035 WHEN I BEGAN TO LOVE HER BUT I HAVE LOVED HER AND HER ALONE ALL MY LIFE AND I LOVE HER SO THAT I CANNOT IMAGINE LIFE WITHOUT HER I CANNOT PROPOSE TO HER AT PRESENT BUT THE THOUGHT
4592-22179-0036 THAT PERHAPS SHE MIGHT SOMEDAY BE MY WIFE AND THAT I MAY BE MISSING THAT POSSIBILITY THAT POSSIBILITY IS TERRIBLE TELL ME CAN I HOPE
4592-22179-0037 TELL ME WHAT I AM TO DO DEAR PRINCESS HE ADDED AFTER A PAUSE AND TOUCHED HER HAND AS SHE DID NOT REPLY I AM THINKING OF WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME ANSWERED PRINCESS MARY THIS IS WHAT I WILL SAY
4592-22179-0038 AT PRESENT PRINCESS MARY STOPPED SHE WAS GOING TO SAY THAT TO SPEAK OF LOVE WAS IMPOSSIBLE BUT SHE STOPPED BECAUSE SHE HAD SEEN BY THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN NATASHA TWO DAYS BEFORE THAT SHE WOULD NOT ONLY NOT BE HURT IF PIERRE SPOKE OF HIS LOVE
4592-22179-0039 BUT THAT IT WAS THE VERY THING SHE WISHED FOR TO SPEAK TO HER NOW WOULDN'T DO
4592-22179-0040 BUT WHAT AM I TO DO LEAVE IT TO ME SAID PRINCESS MARY I KNOW PIERRE WAS LOOKING INTO PRINCESS MARY'S EYES WELL WELL HE SAID I KNOW THAT SHE LOVES WILL LOVE YOU
4592-22179-0041 PRINCESS MARY CORRECTED HERSELF BEFORE HER WORDS WERE OUT PIERRE HAD SPRUNG UP AND WITH A FRIGHTENED EXPRESSION SEIZED PRINCESS MARY'S HAND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO YOU THINK I MAY HOPE YOU THINK YES I THINK SO SAID PRINCESS MARY WITH A SMILE WRITE TO HER PARENTS AND LEAVE IT TO ME
4592-22179-0042 I WILL TELL HER WHEN I CAN I WISH IT TO HAPPEN AND MY HEART TELLS ME IT WILL NO IT CANNOT BE HOW HAPPY I AM BUT IT CAN'T BE HOW HAPPY I AM NO IT CAN'T BE
4592-22179-0043 PIERRE KEPT SAYING AS HE KISSED PRINCESS MARY'S HANDS GO TO PETERSBURG THAT WILL BE BEST AND I WILL WRITE TO YOU SHE SAID
4592-22179-0044 BUT I MAY COME AGAIN TOMORROW NEXT DAY PIERRE CAME TO SAY GOOD BY NATASHA WAS LESS ANIMATED THAN SHE HAD BEEN THE DAY BEFORE BUT THAT DAY AS HE LOOKED AT HER PIERRE SOMETIMES FELT AS IF HE WAS VANISHING
4592-22179-0045 AND THAT NEITHER HE NOR SHE EXISTED ANY LONGER THAT NOTHING EXISTED BUT HAPPINESS IS IT POSSIBLE NO IT CAN'T BE HE TOLD HIMSELF AT EVERY LOOK GESTURE AND WORD THAT FILLED HIS SOUL WITH JOY
4592-22179-0046 WHEN ON SAYING GOOD BY HE TOOK HER THIN SLENDER HAND HE COULD NOT HELP HOLDING IT A LITTLE LONGER IN HIS OWN IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THIS HAND THAT FACE THOSE EYES ALL THIS TREASURE OF FEMININE CHARM SO STRANGE TO ME NOW
4592-22179-0047 IS IT POSSIBLE THAT IT WILL ONE DAY BE MINE FOREVER AS FAMILIAR TO ME AS I AM TO MYSELF
4592-22179-0048 GOOD BYE COUNT SHE SAID ALOUD
4592-22179-0049 AND THESE SIMPLE WORDS HER LOOK AND THE EXPRESSION ON HER FACE WHICH ACCOMPANIED THEM FORMED FOR TWO MONTHS THE SUBJECT OF INEXHAUSTIBLE MEMORIES INTERPRETATIONS AND HAPPY MEDITATIONS FOR PIERRE
4592-22179-0050 I SHALL LOOK FORWARD VERY MUCH TO YOUR RETURN YES YES HOW DID SHE SAY IT YES I SHALL LOOK FORWARD VERY MUCH TO YOUR RETURN OH HOW HAPPY I AM
