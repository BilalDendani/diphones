511-131228-0000 VISCOUS AND PUTRID
511-131228-0001 STORY OF A HIGHLY UNPLEASANT SUBSTANCE THAT HAD FALLEN FROM THE SKY IN WILSON COUNTY TENNESSEE WE READ THAT DOCTOR TROOST VISITED THE PLACE AND INVESTIGATED LATER WE'RE GOING TO INVESTIGATE SOME INVESTIGATIONS
511-131228-0002 THAT THEY HAD SCATTERED THE DECAYING FLESH OF A DEAD HOG OVER THE TOBACCO FIELDS IF WE DON'T ACCEPT THIS DATUM
511-131228-0003 IT HAD BEEN EXAMINED AND DESCRIBED BY PROFESSOR GRAVES FORMERLY LECTURER AT DARTMOUTH COLLEGE IT WAS AN OBJECT THAT HAD UPON IT A NAP SIMILAR TO THAT OF MILLED CLOTH UPON REMOVING THIS NAP
511-131228-0004 A BUFF COLORED PULPY SUBSTANCE WAS FOUND
511-131228-0005 IS PROFESSOR GRAVES ACCOUNT COMMUNICATED BY PROFESSOR DEWEY THAT UPON THE EVENING OF AUGUST THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN A LIGHT WAS SEEN IN AMHERST A FALLING OBJECT SOUND
511-131228-0006 THE NEXT MORNING IN PROFESSOR DEWEY'S FRONT YARD IN WHAT IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN THE ONLY POSITION FROM WHICH THE LIGHT THAT HAD BEEN SEEN IN THE ROOM THE NIGHT BEFORE COULD HAVE BEEN REFLECTED
511-131228-0007 WAS FOUND A SUBSTANCE UNLIKE ANYTHING BEFORE OBSERVED BY ANYONE WHO SAW IT IT WAS A BOWL SHAPED OBJECT ABOUT EIGHT INCHES IN DIAMETER AND ONE INCH THICK BRIGHT BUFF COLORED AND HAVING UPON IT A
511-131228-0008 UPON REMOVING THIS COVERING A BUFF COLORED PULPY SUBSTANCE OF THE CONSISTENCY OF SOFT SOAP WAS FOUND OF AN OFFENSIVE SUFFOCATING SMELL
511-131228-0009 A FEW MINUTES OF EXPOSURE TO THE AIR CHANGED THE BUFF COLOR TO A LIVID COLOR RESEMBLING VENOUS BLOOD IT ABSORBED MOISTURE QUICKLY FROM THE AIR AND LIQUEFIED FOR SOME OF THE CHEMIC REACTIONS SEE THE JOURNAL
511-131228-0010 THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BELONG HERE LONDON TIMES APRIL NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX FALL OF FISH THAT HAD OCCURRED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
511-131228-0011 IT IS SAID THAT THE FISH WERE OF THE CHALWA SPECIES ABOUT A SPAN IN LENGTH AND A SEER IN WEIGHT YOU KNOW THEY WERE DEAD AND DRY OR
511-131228-0012 EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE SO DEFINITELY IDENTIFIED AS OF A KNOWN LOCAL SPECIES OR THEY WERE NOT FISH AT ALL I INCLINE MYSELF TO THE ACCEPTANCE THAT THEY WERE NOT FISH
511-131228-0013 IT IS SAID THAT WHATEVER THEY WERE THEY COULD NOT BE EATEN THAT IN THE PAN
511-131228-0014 MAY SIXTEENTH OR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FOUR IS THE DATE GIVEN IN THE JOURNAL
511-131228-0015 OCCURS THE INEVITABLE DAMNATION OF THE AMHERST OBJECT PROFESSOR EDWARD HITCHCOCK WENT TO LIVE IN AMHERST
511-131228-0016 HAD BEEN FOUND AT NEARLY THE SAME PLACE PROFESSOR HITCHCOCK WAS INVITED BY PROFESSOR GRAVES TO EXAMINE IT EXACTLY LIKE THE FIRST ONE CORRESPONDED IN SIZE AND COLOR AND CONSISTENCY THE CHEMIC REACTIONS WERE THE SAME PROFESSOR HITCHCOCK
511-131228-0017 RECOGNIZED IT IN A MOMENT IT WAS A GELATINOUS FUNGUS HE DID NOT SATISFY HIMSELF AS TO JUST THE EXACT SPECIES IT BELONGED TO BUT HE PREDICTED THAT SIMILAR FUNGI MIGHT SPRING UP WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS
511-131228-0018 BUT BEFORE EVENING TWO OTHERS SPRANG UP OR WE'VE ARRIVED AT ONE OF THE OLDEST OF THE EXCLUSIONISTS CONVENTIONS OR NOSTOC WE SHALL HAVE MANY DATA
511-131228-0019 ALMOST ALWAYS THE EXCLUSIONISTS ARGUE
511-131228-0020 AN ALGA OR IN SOME RESPECTS A FUNGOUS GROWTH THE RIVAL CONVENTION IS SPAWN OF FROGS OR OF FISHES THESE TWO CONVENTIONS HAVE MADE A STRONG COMBINATION
511-131228-0021 WHEN THE TESTIMONY WAS TOO GOOD THAT IT HAD FALLEN
511-131228-0022 IN A WHIRLWIND NOW I CAN'T SAY THAT NOSTOC IS ALWAYS GREENISH ANY MORE THAN I CAN SAY THAT BLACKBIRDS ARE ALWAYS BLACK HAVING SEEN A WHITE ONE WE SHALL QUOTE A SCIENTIST WHO KNEW OF FLESH COLORED NOSTOC WHEN
511-131228-0023 SO TO KNOW WAS CONVENIENT WHEN WE COME TO REPORTED FALLS OF GELATINOUS SUBSTANCES I'D LIKE IT TO BE NOTICED HOW OFTEN THEY ARE DESCRIBED AS WHITISH OR GRAYISH IN LOOKING UP THE SUBJECT MYSELF I HAVE READ ONLY
511-131228-0024 GREEN SCIENCE GOSSIP
511-131228-0025 IT WOULD SEEM ACCEPTABLE THAT IF MANY REPORTS OF WHITE BIRDS SHOULD OCCUR THE BIRDS ARE NOT BLACKBIRDS EVEN THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN WHITE BLACKBIRDS OR THAT IF OFTEN REPORTED
511-131228-0026 GRAYISH OR WHITISH GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE IS NOT NOSTOC AND IS NOT SPAWN IF OCCURRING IN TIMES UNSEASONABLE FOR SPAWN THE KENTUCKY PHENOMENON
511-131228-0027 AND NOW WE HAVE AN OCCURRENCE THAT ATTRACTED A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION IN ITS OWN TIME USUALLY THESE THINGS OF THE ACCURSED HAVE BEEN HUSHED UP OR DISREGARDED SUPPRESSED LIKE THE SEVEN BLACK RAINS OF SLAINS BUT UPON MARCH THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX
511-131228-0028 SOMETHING OCCURRED IN BATH COUNTY KENTUCKY THAT BROUGHT MANY NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENTS TO THE SCENE THE SUBSTANCE THAT LOOKED LIKE BEEF THAT FELL FROM THE SKY
511-131228-0029 UPON MARCH THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX AT OLYMPIAN SPRINGS BATH COUNTY KENTUCKY FLAKES OF A SUBSTANCE THAT LOOKED LIKE BEEF FELL FROM THE SKY FROM A CLEAR SKY WE'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT WAS SAID
511-131228-0030 THAT NOTHING BUT THIS FALLING SUBSTANCE WAS VISIBLE IN THE SKY IT FELL IN FLAKES OF VARIOUS SIZES SOME TWO INCHES SQUARE
511-131228-0031 THE FLAKE FORMATION IS INTERESTING LATER WE SHALL THINK OF IT AS SIGNIFYING PRESSURE SOMEWHERE IT WAS A THICK SHOWER ON THE GROUND ON TREES ON FENCES BUT IT WAS NARROWLY LOCALIZED
511-131228-0032 AND THE NEW YORK TIMES MARCH TENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX THEN THE EXCLUSIONISTS SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE BEEF ONE FLAKE OF IT THE SIZE OF A SQUARE ENVELOPE
511-131228-0033 NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENTS WROTE BROADCAST AND WITNESSES WERE QUOTED AND THIS TIME THERE IS NO MENTION OF A HOAX AND EXCEPT BY ONE SCIENTIST
511-131228-0034 THAT THE FALL DID TAKE PLACE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE EXCLUSIONISTS ARE STILL MORE EMPHATICALLY CONSERVATORS IT IS NOT SO MUCH THAT THEY ARE INIMICAL TO ALL DATA
511-131228-0035 OF EXTERNALLY DERIVED SUBSTANCES THAT FALL UPON THIS EARTH AS THAT THEY ARE INIMICAL TO ALL DATA DISCORDANT WITH A SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE SUCH PHENOMENA
511-131228-0036 OR THE SPIRIT OR HOPE OR AMBITION OF THE COSMOS WHICH WE CALL ATTEMPTED POSITIVISM NOT TO FIND OUT THE NEW NOT TO ADD TO WHAT IS CALLED KNOWLEDGE BUT TO SYSTEMATIZE
511-131228-0037 EXPRESSED IN THE SUPPLEMENT IS AMUSING TO SOME OF US WHO I FEAR MAY BE A LITTLE IMPROPER AT TIMES VERY SPIRIT OF THE SALVATION ARMY WHEN SOME THIRD RATE SCIENTIST COMES OUT WITH AN EXPLANATION OF THE VERMIFORM APPENDIX
511-131228-0038 TO GIVE COMPLETENESS TO THE PROPER EXPLANATION IT IS SAID THAT MISTER BRANDEIS HAD IDENTIFIED THE SUBSTANCE AS FLESH COLORED NOSTOC PROFESSOR LAWRENCE SMITH OF KENTUCKY
511-131228-0039 ONE OF THE MOST RESOLUTE OF THE EXCLUSIONISTS NEW YORK TIMES MARCH TWELFTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX THAT THE SUBSTANCE HAD BEEN EXAMINED AND ANALYZED BY PROFESSOR SMITH ACCORDING TO WHOM IT GAVE EVERY INDICATION OF BEING THE
511-131228-0040 DOCTOR A MEAD EDWARDS PRESIDENT OF THE NEWARK SCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATION
511-131228-0041 HIS FEELING WAS OF CONVICTION THAT PROPRIETY HAD BEEN RE ESTABLISHED OR THAT THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN SOLVED AS HE EXPRESSES IT KNOWING MISTER BRANDEIS WELL HE HAD CALLED UPON THAT UPHOLDER OF RESPECTABILITY
511-131228-0042 TO SEE THE SUBSTANCE THAT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS NOSTOC BUT HE HAD ALSO CALLED UPON DOCTOR HAMILTON WHO HAD A SPECIMEN AND DOCTOR HAMILTON HAD DECLARED IT TO BE LUNG TISSUE DOCTOR EDWARDS
511-131228-0043 WRITES OF THE SUBSTANCE THAT HAD SO COMPLETELY OR BEAUTIFULLY IF BEAUTY IS COMPLETENESS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS NOSTOC IT TURNED OUT TO BE LUNG TISSUE ALSO
511-131228-0044 NEVERTHELESS HE ENDORSES THE LOCAL EXPLANATION AND A BIZARRE THING IT IS A FLOCK OF GORGED HEAVY WEIGHTED BUZZARDS BUT FAR UP AND INVISIBLE IN THE CLEAR SKY
511-131228-0045 THEY HAD DISGORGED PROFESSOR FASSIG LISTS THE SUBSTANCE IN HIS BIBLIOGRAPHY AS FISH SPAWN MC ATEE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY NINETEEN EIGHTEEN
511-131228-0046 IF THE WHOLE WORLD SHOULD SEEM TO COMBINE AGAINST YOU IT IS ONLY UNREAL COMBINATION OR INTERMEDIATENESS TO UNITY AND DISUNITY EVERY RESISTANCE IS ITSELF DIVIDED INTO PARTS RESISTING ONE ANOTHER THE SIMPLEST STRATEGY SEEMS TO BE
511-131228-0047 NEVER BOTHER TO FIGHT A THING SET ITS OWN PARTS FIGHTING ONE ANOTHER WE ARE MERGING AWAY FROM CARNAL TO GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE AND HERE THERE IS AN ABUNDANCE OF INSTANCES OR REPORTS OF INSTANCES
511-131228-0048 THESE DATA ARE SO IMPROPER THEY'RE OBSCENE TO THE SCIENCE OF TODAY BUT WE SHALL SEE THAT SCIENCE
511-131228-0049 WAS NOT SO PRUDISH CHLADNI WAS NOT AND GREG WAS NOT I SHALL HAVE TO ACCEPT MYSELF THAT GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE HAS OFTEN FALLEN FROM THE SKY OR THAT
511-131228-0050 FAR UP OR FAR AWAY THE WHOLE SKY IS GELATINOUS THAT METEORS TEAR THROUGH AND DETACH FRAGMENTS THAT FRAGMENTS ARE BROUGHT DOWN BY STORMS
511-131228-0051 IT SEEMS MORE ACCEPTABLE THAT ONLY CERTAIN AREAS ARE
511-131228-0052 SAYS THAT ALL OUR DATA IN THIS RESPECT MUST BE
511-131228-0053 HE IS VERY SURE BUT JUST A LITTLE REDUNDANT WE SHALL BE OPPOSED BY THE STANDARD RESISTANCES THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE UP FROM ONE PLACE IN A WHIRLWIND AND DOWN IN ANOTHER
511-131228-0054 WITH WHICH WE SHALL END UP IT WILL MEAN THAT SOMETHING HAD BEEN IN A STATIONARY POSITION FOR SEVERAL DAYS OVER A SMALL PART OF A SMALL TOWN IN ENGLAND THIS IS THE REVOLUTIONARY THING THAT WE HAVE ALLUDED TO BEFORE
511-131228-0055 WHETHER THE SUBSTANCE WERE NOSTOC OR SPAWN OR SOME KIND OF A LARVAL NEXUS DOESN'T MATTER SO MUCH IF IT STOOD IN THE SKY FOR SEVERAL DAYS WE RANK WITH MOSES AS A CHRONICLER OF IMPROPRIETIES
511-131228-0056 TO ACCEPT CONNECTION OR THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST VAST GELATINOUS AREAS ALOFT AND THAT METEORITES TEAR THROUGH CARRYING DOWN SOME OF THE SUBSTANCE
511-131228-0057 PLACED BEFORE THE ACADEMY SOME FRAGMENTS OF A GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE SAID TO HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY AND ASKED THAT THEY BE ANALYZED THERE IS NO FURTHER ALLUSION TO THIS SUBJECT COMPTES RENDUS
511-131228-0058 THAT IN WILNA LITHUANIA APRIL FOURTH EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX IN A RAINSTORM FELL NUT SIZED MASSES OF A SUBSTANCE THAT IS DESCRIBED AS BOTH RESINOUS AND GELATINOUS IT WAS ODORLESS UNTIL BURNED
511-131228-0059 THEN IT SPREAD A VERY PRONOUNCED SWEETISH ODOR IT IS DESCRIBED AS LIKE GELATINE BUT MUCH FIRMER BUT HAVING BEEN IN WATER TWENTY FOUR HOURS IT SWELLED OUT
511-131228-0060 EARLY IN AUGUST EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR THOUSANDS OF JELLYFISH ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SHILLING HAD FALLEN AT BATH ENGLAND I THINK IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE THAT THEY WERE JELLYFISH BUT IT DOES LOOK
511-131228-0061 AS IF THIS TIME FROG SPAWN DID FALL FROM THE SKY AND MAY HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED BY A WHIRLWIND BECAUSE
511-131228-0062 SMALL FROGS FELL AT WIGAN ENGLAND NATURE EIGHTY SEVEN TEN THAT JUNE TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN ELEVEN AT ETON BUCKS ENGLAND THE GROUND WAS FOUND COVERED WITH MASSES OF JELLY THE SIZE OF PEAS
511-131228-0063 AFTER A HEAVY RAINFALL WE ARE NOT TOLD OF NOSTOC THIS TIME IT IS SAID THAT THE OBJECT CONTAINED NUMEROUS EGGS
511-131228-0064 OF BATH HIS DESCRIPTION IS OF MINUTE WORMS IN FILMY ENVELOPES HE TRIES TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR SEGREGATION THE MYSTERY OF IT IS WHAT COULD HAVE BROUGHT SO MANY OF THEM TOGETHER
511-131228-0065 AND IN MOST OF THEM SEGREGATION IS THE GREAT MYSTERY A WHIRLWIND SEEMS ANYTHING BUT A SEGREGATIVE FORCE SEGREGATION OF THINGS THAT HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY HAS BEEN AVOIDED AS MOST DEEP DYED OF THE DAMNED
511-131228-0066 MISTER JENYNS CONCEIVES OF A LARGE POOL IN WHICH WERE MANY OF THESE SPHERICAL MASSES OF THE POOL DRYING UP AND CONCENTRATING ALL IN A SMALL AREA OF A WHIRLWIND THEN SCOOPING ALL UP TOGETHER
511-131228-0067 IT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE COMMON SENSE TO SAY THAT THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STATIONARY OVER THE TOWN OF BATH SEVERAL DAYS THE SEVEN BLACK RAINS OF SLAINS THE FOUR RED RAINS OF SIENA
511-131228-0068 FALLS OF VISCID SUBSTANCE IN THE YEARS SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO SIXTEEN EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN NINETY SIX EIGHTEEN ELEVEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR
511-131228-0069 HE GIVES EARLIER DATES BUT I PRACTICE EXCLUSIONS MYSELF IN THE REPORT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIXTY THREE
511-131228-0070 THAT SEEMED TO PASS NEAR THE GROUND
511-131228-0071 THE NEXT DAY A JELLY LIKE MASS WAS FOUND IN THE SNOW
511-131228-0072 FOR EITHER SPAWN OR NOSTOC GREG'S COMMENT IN THIS INSTANCE IS CURIOUS IF TRUE BUT HE RECORDS WITHOUT MODIFICATION THE FALL OF A METEORITE AT GOTHA GERMANY SEPTEMBER SIXTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE
511-131228-0073 LEAVING A JELLY LIKE MASS ON THE GROUND WE ARE TOLD THAT THIS SUBSTANCE FELL ONLY THREE FEET AWAY FROM AN OBSERVER IN THE REPORT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE NINETY FOUR ACCORDING TO A LETTER FROM GREG TO PROFESSOR BADEN POWELL
511-131228-0074 AT NIGHT OCTOBER EIGHTH EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR NEAR COBLENZ A GERMAN WHO WAS KNOWN TO GREG AND ANOTHER PERSON SAW A LUMINOUS BODY FALL CLOSE TO THEM THEY RETURNED NEXT MORNING AND FOUND A GELATINOUS MASS
511-131228-0075 LUMPS OF JELLY WERE FOUND ON THE GROUND AT RAHWAY NEW JERSEY THE SUBSTANCE WAS WHITISH OR RESEMBLED THE COAGULATED WHITE OF AN EGG THAT MISTER H H GARLAND OF NELSON COUNTY VIRGINIA HAD FOUND A JELLY LIKE SUBSTANCE
511-131228-0076 OF ABOUT THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF A TWENTY FIVE CENT PIECE THAT ACCORDING TO A COMMUNICATION FROM A C TWINING TO PROFESSOR OLMSTEAD A WOMAN AT WEST POINT NEW YORK
511-131228-0077 HAD SEEN A MASS THE SIZE OF A TEACUP IT LOOKED LIKE BOILED STARCH THAT ACCORDING TO A NEWSPAPER OF NEWARK NEW JERSEY A MASS OF GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE LIKE SOFT SOAP HAD BEEN FOUND
