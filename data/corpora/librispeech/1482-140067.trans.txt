1482-140067-0000 BEFORE THE GODS THAT MADE THE GODS HAD SEEN THEIR SUNRISE PASS THE WHITE HORSE OF THE WHITE HORSE VALE WAS CUT OUT OF THE GRASS BEFORE THE GODS THAT MADE THE GODS HAD DRUNK AT DAWN THEIR FILL
1482-140067-0001 THE WHITE HORSE OF THE WHITE HORSE VALE WAS HOARY ON THE HILL AGE BEYOND AGE ON BRITISH LAND AEONS ON AEONS GONE WAS PEACE AND WAR IN WESTERN HILLS AND THE WHITE HORSE LOOKED ON
1482-140067-0002 FOR THE WHITE HORSE KNEW ENGLAND WHEN THERE WAS NONE TO KNOW HE SAW THE FIRST OAR BREAK OR BEND HE SAW HEAVEN FALL AND THE WORLD END O GOD HOW LONG AGO FOR THE END OF THE WORLD WAS LONG AGO
1482-140067-0003 AND ALL WE DWELL TO DAY AS CHILDREN OF SOME SECOND BIRTH LIKE A STRANGE PEOPLE LEFT ON EARTH AFTER A JUDGMENT DAY FOR THE END OF THE WORLD WAS LONG AGO WHEN THE ENDS OF THE WORLD WAXED FREE
1482-140067-0004 WHEN ROME WAS SUNK IN A WASTE OF SLAVES AND THE SUN DROWNED IN THE SEA WHEN CAESAR'S SUN FELL OUT OF THE SKY AND WHOSO HEARKENED RIGHT COULD ONLY HEAR THE PLUNGING OF THE NATIONS IN THE NIGHT
1482-140067-0005 WHEN THE ENDS OF THE EARTH CAME MARCHING IN TO TORCH AND CRESSET GLEAM AND THE ROADS OF THE WORLD THAT LEAD TO ROME WERE FILLED WITH FACES THAT MOVED LIKE FOAM LIKE FACES IN A DREAM AND MEN RODE OUT OF THE EASTERN LANDS
1482-140067-0006 AND MEN BRAKE OUT OF THE NORTHERN LANDS ENORMOUS LANDS ALONE WHERE A SPELL IS LAID UPON LIFE AND LUST AND THE RAIN IS CHANGED TO A SILVER DUST AND THE SEA TO A GREAT GREEN STONE
1482-140067-0007 AND A SHAPE THAT MOVETH MURKILY IN MIRRORS OF ICE AND NIGHT HATH BLANCHED WITH FEAR ALL BEASTS AND BIRDS AS DEATH AND A SHOCK OF EVIL WORDS BLAST A MAN'S HAIR WITH WHITE
1482-140067-0008 AND THE CRY OF THE PALMS AND THE PURPLE MOONS OR THE CRY OF THE FROST AND FOAM SWEPT EVER AROUND AN INMOST PLACE AND THE DIN OF DISTANT RACE ON RACE CRIED AND REPLIED ROUND ROME
1482-140067-0009 AND THERE WAS DEATH ON THE EMPEROR AND NIGHT UPON THE POPE AND ALFRED HIDING IN DEEP GRASS HARDENED HIS HEART WITH HOPE A SEA FOLK BLINDER THAN THE SEA BROKE ALL ABOUT HIS LAND
1482-140067-0010 BUT ALFRED UP AGAINST THEM BARE AND GRIPPED THE GROUND AND GRASPED THE AIR STAGGERED AND STROVE TO STAND HE BENT THEM BACK WITH SPEAR AND SPADE WITH DESPERATE DYKE AND WALL WITH FOEMEN LEANING ON HIS SHIELD
1482-140067-0011 WITH GOLDEN CROWN AND GIRDED FLEECE MADE LAWS UNDER A TREE THE NORTHMEN CAME ABOUT OUR LAND A CHRISTLESS CHIVALRY WHO KNEW NOT OF THE ARCH OR PEN GREAT BEAUTIFUL HALF WITTED MEN FROM THE SUNRISE AND THE SEA
1482-140067-0012 MISSHAPEN SHIPS STOOD ON THE DEEP FULL OF STRANGE GOLD AND FIRE AND HAIRY MEN AS HUGE AS SIN WITH HORNED HEADS CAME WADING IN THROUGH THE LONG LOW SEA MIRE
1482-140067-0013 OUR TOWNS WERE SHAKEN OF TALL KINGS WITH SCARLET BEARDS LIKE BLOOD THE WORLD TURNED EMPTY WHERE THEY TROD THEY TOOK THE KINDLY CROSS OF GOD AND CUT IT UP FOR WOOD THEIR SOULS WERE DRIFTING AS THE SEA
1482-140067-0014 THEY SEEMED AS TREES WALKING THE EARTH AS WITLESS AND AS TALL YET THEY TOOK HOLD UPON THE HEAVENS AND NO HELP CAME AT ALL THEY BRED LIKE BIRDS IN ENGLISH WOODS THEY ROOTED LIKE THE ROSE
1482-140067-0015 TO HIDE HIM FROM THEIR BOWS THERE WAS NOT ENGLISH ARMOUR LEFT NOR ANY ENGLISH THING
1482-140067-0016 TO BE AN ENGLISH KING FOR EARTHQUAKE SWALLOWING EARTHQUAKE UPRENT THE WESSEX TREE THE WHIRLPOOL OF THE PAGAN SWAY HAD SWIRLED HIS SIRES AS STICKS AWAY WHEN A FLOOD SMITES THE SEA
1482-140067-0017 AND THE GREAT KINGS OF WESSEX WEARIED AND SANK IN GORE AND EVEN THEIR GHOSTS IN THAT GREAT STRESS GREW GREYER AND GREYER LESS AND LESS WITH THE LORDS THAT DIED IN LYONESSE AND THE KING THAT COMES NO MORE
1482-140067-0018 AND THE GOD OF THE GOLDEN DRAGON WAS DUMB UPON HIS THRONE AND THE LORD OF THE GOLDEN DRAGON RAN IN THE WOODS ALONE AND IF EVER HE CLIMBED THE CREST OF LUCK AND SET THE FLAG BEFORE RETURNING AS A WHEEL RETURNS
1482-140067-0019 CAME RUIN AND THE RAIN THAT BURNS AND ALL BEGAN ONCE MORE AND NAUGHT WAS LEFT KING ALFRED BUT SHAMEFUL TEARS OF RAGE IN THE ISLAND IN THE RIVER IN THE END OF ALL HIS AGE
1482-140067-0020 IN THE ISLAND IN THE RIVER HE WAS BROKEN TO HIS KNEE AND HE READ WRIT WITH AN IRON PEN THAT GOD HAD WEARIED OF WESSEX MEN AND GIVEN THEIR COUNTRY FIELD AND FEN TO THE DEVILS OF THE SEA
1482-140067-0021 HIS MOTHER SITTING IN EGBERT'S HALL AND A BOOK SHE SHOWED HIM VERY SMALL WHERE A SAPPHIRE MARY SAT IN STALL WITH A GOLDEN CHRIST AT PLAY IT WAS WROUGHT IN THE MONK'S SLOW MANNER FROM SILVER AND SANGUINE SHELL
1482-140067-0022 AND THERE OUR LADY WAS SHE STOOD AND STROKED THE TALL LIVE GRASS AS A MAN STROKES HIS STEED HER FACE WAS LIKE AN OPEN WORD WHEN BRAVE MEN SPEAK AND CHOOSE THE VERY COLOURS OF HER COAT WERE BETTER THAN GOOD NEWS
1482-140067-0023 AND THE RIVER RUNNING PAST ONE DIM ANCESTRAL JEWEL HUNG ON HIS RUINED ARMOUR GREY HE RENT AND CAST IT AT HER FEET WHERE AFTER CENTURIES WITH SLOW FEET MEN CAME FROM HALL AND SCHOOL AND STREET
1482-140067-0024 AND FOUND IT WHERE IT LAY MOTHER OF GOD THE WANDERER SAID I AM BUT A COMMON KING NOR WILL I ASK WHAT SAINTS MAY ASK TO SEE A SECRET THING THE GATES OF HEAVEN ARE FEARFUL GATES WORSE THAN THE GATES OF HELL
1482-140067-0025 BUT FOR THIS EARTH MOST PITIFUL THIS LITTLE LAND I KNOW IF THAT WHICH IS FOR EVER IS OR IF OUR HEARTS SHALL BREAK WITH BLISS SEEING THE STRANGER GO WHEN OUR LAST BOW IS BROKEN QUEEN AND OUR LAST JAVELIN CAST
1482-140067-0026 UNDER SOME SAD GREEN EVENING SKY HOLDING A RUINED CROSS ON HIGH UNDER WARM WESTLAND GRASS TO LIE SHALL WE COME HOME AT LAST AND A VOICE CAME HUMAN BUT HIGH UP
1482-140067-0027 AND SEE THE DEAR AND DREADFUL THINGS I HID WITHIN MY HEART THE MEANEST MAN IN GREY FIELDS GONE BEHIND THE SET OF SUN HEARETH BETWEEN STAR AND OTHER STAR
1482-140067-0028 BUT IF HE FAIL OR IF HE WIN TO NO GOOD MAN IS TOLD THE MEN OF THE EAST MAY SPELL THE STARS AND TIMES AND TRIUMPHS MARK BUT THE MEN SIGNED OF THE CROSS OF CHRIST GO GAILY IN THE DARK
1482-140067-0029 THEY TRIM SAD LAMPS THEY TOUCH SAD STRINGS HEARING THE HEAVY PURPLE WINGS WHERE THE FORGOTTEN SERAPH KINGS STILL PLOT HOW GOD SHALL DIE THE WISE MEN KNOW ALL EVIL THINGS UNDER THE TWISTED TREES
1482-140067-0030 WHERE THE PERVERSE IN PLEASURE PINE AND MEN ARE WEARY OF GREEN WINE AND SICK OF CRIMSON SEAS BUT YOU AND ALL THE KIND OF CHRIST ARE IGNORANT AND BRAVE AND YOU HAVE WARS YOU HARDLY WIN
1482-140067-0031 NIGHT SHALL BE THRICE NIGHT OVER YOU AND HEAVEN AN IRON COPE DO YOU HAVE JOY WITHOUT A CAUSE YEA FAITH WITHOUT A HOPE EVEN AS SHE SPOKE SHE WAS NOT
1482-140067-0032 NOR ANY WORD SAID HE HE ONLY HEARD STILL AS HE STOOD UNDER THE OLD NIGHT'S NODDING HOOD THE SEA FOLK BREAKING DOWN THE WOOD LIKE A HIGH TIDE FROM SEA HE ONLY HEARD THE HEATHEN MEN
1482-140067-0033 WHOSE EYES ARE BLUE AND BLEAK SINGING ABOUT SOME CRUEL THING DONE BY A GREAT AND SMILING KING IN DAYLIGHT ON A DECK HE ONLY HEARD THE HEATHEN MEN WHOSE EYES ARE BLUE AND BLIND
