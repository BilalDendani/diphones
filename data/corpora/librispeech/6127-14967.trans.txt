6127-14967-0025 IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SUCCEED YOU'VE GOT TO PULL TOGETHER EVERY MEMBER OF YOU OR YOU WON'T GET ANYWHERE AND I SHOULD THINK THAT YOU'D HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOW AT FIRST WHOM YOU GET IN OF COURSE AFTER YOU'RE PRETTY STRONG YOU CAN TAKE IN A FEW JUST TO HELP THEM BUT

6127-14967-0033 ALLISON POLITE TO THE LAST CLOSED THE DOOR WITH A COURTEOUS GOOD NIGHT AND THEN STOOD FROWNING AT THE FIRE JULIA CLOUD CAME SOFTLY INTO THE ROOM AND WENT AND STOOD BESIDE HIM WITH LOVING QUESTION IN HER EYES HE MET HER GAZE WITH A NEW KIND OF HARDNESS
6127-14967-0034 NOW YOU SEE WHAT YOU LET ME IN FOR CLOUDY WHEN YOU MADE ME GO TO THAT LITTLE OLD DULL CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR BUT I WON'T DO IT THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT YOU NEEDN'T THINK I'M GOING TO THE IDEA WHY WHAT DID WE COME HERE TO COLLEGE FOR
6127-14967-0035 WHAT GOOD DO THEY THINK THEY CAN DO A COUPLE OF SISSIES AND TWO OR THREE KID VAMPS SETTING UP TO LISP RELIGION IT'S RIDICULOUS HE WAS WORKING HIMSELF UP INTO A FINE FRENZY JULIA CLOUD STOOD AND WATCHED HIM AN AMUSED SMILE GROWING ON HER SWEET LIPS
6127-14967-0036 HE CAUGHT THE AMUSEMENT AND FIRED UP AT IT
6127-14967-0037 AND YOU KNOW I COULDN'T HELP THEM ANYHOW COME NOW DON'T YOU WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING LIKE THAT FOR CLOUDY I BELIEVE YOU'RE LAUGHING AT ME YOU THINK I'LL GO AND GET INTO THIS THING BUT I'LL SHOW YOU I WON'T AND THAT'S AN END OF IT
6127-14967-0038 CLOUDY I INSIST ON KNOWING WHAT YOU FIND TO LAUGH AT IN THIS SITUATION WHY I WAS JUST THINKING HOW MUCH YOU REMINDED ME OF MOSES SAID JULIA CLOUD SWEETLY OF MOSES SCREAMED ALLISON HALF ANGRILY
6127-14967-0039 OH NO HE WASN'T ALWAYS MEEK SAID HIS AUNT THOUGHTFULLY AND HE TALKED JUST AS YOU ARE DOING WHEN GOD CALLED ON HIM FIRST TO LEAD THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL OUT OF EGYPT HE SAID HE COULDN'T AND HE WOULDN'T AND HE SHOULDN'T
6127-14967-0040 SETTLING INTO A BIG CHAIR BY THE FIRE BUT I DON'T LIKE THOSE GIRLS ONE BIT AND I DON'T CARE IF THEY STAY IN SEVEN EGYPTS NOW LOOK HERE CLOUDY JEWEL PLEADED ALLISON YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET ME INTO ANY SUCH CORNER AS THAT
6127-14967-0041 THE IDEA THAT GOD WOULD CALL ME TO DO ANY OF HIS WORK WHEN I NEVER HAD ANYTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH THE CHURCH IN MY LIFE AND I DON'T WANT TO HOW SHOULD I KNOW WHAT TO DO WHY SHOULD HE EVER CALL ME I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHEN I DON'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT CHURCHES YOU'RE ALL OFF CLOUDY
6127-14967-0042 THINK AGAIN WHY I'M NOT EVEN WHAT YOU'D CALL A CHRISTIAN HE SURELY WOULDN'T CALL PEOPLE THAT HAVEN'T WELL WHAT YOU'D CALL ENLISTED WITH HIM WOULD HE HE MIGHT ANSWERED JULIA CLOUD REFLECTIVELY SHE WAS SITTING ON THE END OF THE BIG BLUE COUCH
6127-14967-0043 AND TOLD THEM TO GO AND DO SOMETHING FOR HIM THERE WAS PAUL HE WAS ACTUALLY AGAINST HIM AND THERE WAS ABRAHAM HE LIVED AMONG REGULAR IDOL WORSHIPPERS AND GOD CALLED HIM TO GO INTO A STRANGE LAND AND FOUNDED A NEW FAMILY FOR HIM THE BEGINNING OF THE PECULIAR PEOPLE
6127-14967-0044 THROUGH WHOSE LINE WAS TO COME JESUS THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD AND ABRAHAM WENT OH NONSENSE CLOUDY THAT WAS IN THOSE TIMES OF COURSE THERE WASN'T ANYBODY ELSE I SUPPOSE AND HE HAD TO TAKE SOME ONE BUT NOW THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO GO TO CHURCH ALL THE TIME AND LIKE THAT SORT OF THING
6127-14967-0045 HOW DO YOU KNOW ALLISON PERHAPS YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE IN THIS TOWN AND GOD HAS SENT YOU HERE JUST TO DO THIS SPECIAL WORK WELL I WON'T AND THAT'S FLAT CLOUDY SO YOU CAN PUT THE IDEA RIGHT OUT OF YOUR HEAD I WON'T NOT EVEN FOR YOU
6127-14967-0046 ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL COMFORT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT ABOUT OF COURSE BUT THIS BELONGS ENTIRELY TO THAT LITTLE OLD RATTY CHURCH AND I HAVEN'T ANYTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH IT AND I WANT YOU TO FORGET IT CLOUDY FOR I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT
6127-14967-0047 WHY ALLISON YOU'RE MISTAKEN ABOUT ME IT ISN'T MY AFFAIR AND I DON'T INTEND TO MAKE IT SO I DIDN'T GET THIS UP IT'S BETWEEN YOU AND GOD IF GOD REALLY CALLED YOU YOU'LL HAVE TO SAY NO TO HIM NOT TO ME I DON'T INTEND TO MAKE EXCUSES TO GOD FOR YOU CHILD
6127-14967-0048 YOU NEEDN'T THINK IT AND BESIDES THERE'S ANOTHER THING YOU'RE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN ABOUT AND THAT IS THAT YOU HAVEN'T ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE CHURCH WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE BABY SIX MONTHS OLD YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER BROUGHT YOU HOME TO OUR HOUSE AND THE FIRST SUNDAY THEY WERE THERE
6127-14967-0049 THEY TOOK YOU TO THE OLD CHURCH WHERE ALL THE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN HAD BEEN CHRISTENED FOR YEARS AND THEY STOOD UP AND ASSENTED TO THE VOWS THAT GAVE YOU TO GOD AND THEY PROMISED FOR THEMSELVES THAT THEY WOULD DO THEIR BEST TO BRING YOU UP IN THE NURTURE AND ADMONITION OF THE LORD
6127-14967-0050 UNTIL YOU CAME TO YEARS AND COULD FINISH THE BOND BY GIVING YOURSELF TO THE LORD I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE SWEET SERIOUS LOOK ON THE FACE OF YOUR LOVELY GIRL MOTHER WHEN SHE BOWED HER HEAD IN ANSWER TO THE MINISTER'S QUESTION DO YOU THUS PROMISE
6127-14967-0051 ALLISON HAD STOPPED IN HIS ANGRY WALK UP AND DOWN THE ROOM AND WAS LOOKING AT HER INTERESTEDLY IS THAT RIGHT CLOUDY WAS I BAPTIZED IN THE OLD STERLING CHURCH I NEVER KNEW THAT TELL ME ABOUT IT AND HE SEATED HIMSELF ON THE OTHER END OF THE COUCH
6127-14967-0052 WHILE LESLIE SWITCHED OFF THE LIGHT AND NESTLED DOWN BETWEEN THEM SCENTING A STORY WASN'T I TOO CLOUDY SHE ASKED HUNGRILY NO DEAR I THINK YOU WERE BAPTIZED IN CALIFORNIA IN YOUR MOTHER'S CHURCH AND I'M SORRY TO SAY I WASN'T THERE TO SEE
6127-14967-0053 SO I CAN'T TELL YOU ABOUT IT BUT I REMEMBER VERY DISTINCTLY ALL ABOUT ALLISON'S CHRISTENING FOR WE WERE ALL SO HAPPY TO HAVE IT HAPPEN IN THE EAST AND HE WAS THE FIRST GRANDCHILD AND WE HADN'T SEEN YOUR FATHER FOR OVER TWO YEARS NOR EVER SEEN HIS YOUNG WIFE BEFORE
6127-14967-0054 YOU LOOKED OVER YOUR FATHER'S SHOULDER AND SAW ME SITTING IN THE FRONT SEAT AND SMILED THE SWEETEST SMILE THEN YOU JUMPED UP AND DOWN IN YOUR FATHER'S ARMS AND SPATTED YOUR LITTLE PINK HANDS TOGETHER AND CALLED OUT AH JAH
6127-14967-0055 YOU KNOW ALLISON THAT CEREMONY WASN'T JUST ALL ON YOUR FATHER'S AND MOTHER'S PART IT ENTAILED SOME RESPONSIBILITY UPON YOU IT WAS PART OF YOUR HERITAGE AND YOU'VE NO RIGHT TO WASTE IT ANY MORE THAN IF IT WERE GOLD OR BANK STOCK OR HOUSES AND LANDS
6127-14967-0056 BECAUSE IT IS YOU WHO MUST ANSWER GOD AND YOU MUST ANSWER HIM FROM THE HEART EITHER WAY SO NOBODY ELSE HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT OH GOOD NIGHT CLOUDY YOU CERTAINLY CAN PUT THINGS IN AN AWKWARD WAY OH HANG IT
6127-14967-0057 NOW THIS WHOLE EVENING'S SPOILED I WISH I HADN'T GONE TO THE FRONT DOOR AT ALL I WISH I'D TURNED OUT THE LIGHTS AND LET EM KNOCK AND THERE WAS THAT STORY YOU WERE GOING TO READ AND NOW IT'S TOO LATE WHY NO IT'S NOT TOO LATE AT ALL SAID JULIA CLOUD CONSULTING HER LITTLE WATCH IN THE FIRELIGHT
6127-14967-0058 IT'S ONLY QUARTER TO NINE AND I'M SURE WE CAN INDULGE OURSELVES A LITTLE TO NIGHT AND FINISH THE STORY BEFORE WE GO TO BED TURN THE LIGHT ON AND GET THE MAGAZINE WITH AN AIR OF FINALITY JULIA CLOUD PUT ASIDE THE DEBATED QUESTION
6127-14967-0059 AND SETTLED HERSELF IN THE BIG WILLOW CHAIR BY THE LAMP WITH HER BOOK LESLIE WENT BACK TO HER CHAIR BY THE FIRE AND ALLISON FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN ON THE COUCH WITH A PILLOW HALF OVER HIS EYES BUT ANYBODY WATCHING CLOSELY WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT HIS EYES WERE WIDE OPEN
6127-14967-0060 AND HE WAS STUDYING THE CALM QUIET PROFILE OF HIS AUNT'S SWEET FACE AS SHE READ IN A GENTLE EVEN TONE PARAGRAPH AFTER PARAGRAPH WITHOUT A FLICKER OF DISTURBANCE ON HER BROW ALLISON WAS NOT MORE THAN HALF LISTENING TO THE STORY
