1595-132753-0000 HE WAS REPRESENTED IN POPULAR LAMPOONS AS A MAN MADE TO BE DUPED AS A MAN WHO HAD HITHERTO BEEN THE PREY OF GAMESTERS AND WHO MIGHT AS WELL BE THE PREY OF FRIARS A PASQUINADE
1595-132753-0001 WHICH ABOUT THE TIME OF ROCHESTER'S RETIREMENT
1595-132753-0002 BUT WAS SOON DISMISSED FOR MISCONDUCT IF ANY CREDIT IS DUE TO A TRADITION WHICH WAS LONG PRESERVED IN THE GREEN ROOM HAINES HAD THE IMPUDENCE TO AFFIRM THAT THE VIRGIN MARY HAD APPEARED TO HIM AND CALLED HIM TO REPENTANCE
1595-132753-0003 AFTER THE REVOLUTION HE ATTEMPTED TO MAKE HIS PEACE WITH THE TOWN BY A PENANCE MORE SCANDALOUS THAN HIS OFFENCE ONE NIGHT BEFORE HE ACTED IN A FARCE HE APPEARED ON THE STAGE IN A WHITE SHEET WITH A TORCH IN HIS HAND
1595-132753-0004 THE NAME OF A MORE ILLUSTRIOUS RENEGADE JOHN DRYDEN DRYDEN WAS NOW APPROACHING THE DECLINE OF LIFE AFTER MANY SUCCESSES AND MANY FAILURES HE HAD AT LENGTH ATTAINED BY GENERAL CONSENT
1595-132753-0005 THE FIRST PLACE AMONG LIVING ENGLISH POETS HIS CLAIMS ON THE GRATITUDE OF JAMES WERE SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF ANY MAN OF LETTERS IN THE KINGDOM BUT JAMES CARED LITTLE FOR VERSES AND MUCH FOR MONEY
1595-132753-0006 FROM THE DAY OF HIS ACCESSION HE SET HIMSELF TO MAKE SMALL ECONOMICAL REFORMS SUCH AS BRING ON A GOVERNMENT THE REPROACH OF MEANNESS
1595-132753-0007 AND IMPATIENT OF POVERTY HE KNEW LITTLE AND CARED LITTLE ABOUT RELIGION IF ANY SENTIMENT WAS DEEPLY FIXED IN HIM THAT SENTIMENT WAS AN AVERSION TO PRIESTS OF ALL PERSUASIONS LEVITES AUGURS MUFTIS ROMAN CATHOLIC DIVINES
1595-132753-0008 HE HAD DURING MANY YEARS EARNED HIS DAILY BREAD BY PANDARING TO THE VICIOUS TASTE OF THE PIT AND BY GROSSLY FLATTERING RICH AND NOBLE PATRONS SELFRESPECT AND A FINE SENSE OF THE BECOMING
1595-132753-0009 WERE NOT TO BE EXPECTED FROM ONE WHO HAD LED A LIFE OF MENDICANCY AND ADULATION
1595-132753-0010 THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A STRONG PRESUMPTION AGAINST THE SINCERITY OF A CONVERSION BY WHICH THE CONVERT IS DIRECTLY A GAINER IN THE CASE OF DRYDEN THERE IS NOTHING TO COUNTERVAIL THIS PRESUMPTION HIS THEOLOGICAL WRITINGS ABUNDANTLY PROVE
1595-132753-0011 THAT HE HAD NEVER SOUGHT WITH DILIGENCE AND ANXIETY TO LEARN THE TRUTH AND THAT HIS KNOWLEDGE BOTH OF THE CHURCH WHICH HE QUITTED AND OF THE CHURCH WHICH HE ENTERED WAS OF THE MOST SUPERFICIAL KIND NOR WAS HIS SUBSEQUENT CONDUCT
1595-132753-0012 THAT OF A MAN WHOM A STRONG SENSE OF DUTY HAD CONSTRAINED TO TAKE A STEP OF AWFUL IMPORTANCE HAD HE BEEN SUCH A MAN THE SAME CONVICTION WHICH HAD LED HIM TO JOIN THE CHURCH OF ROME WOULD SURELY HAVE PREVENTED HIM FROM VIOLATING GROSSLY AND HABITUALLY
1595-132753-0013 RULES WHICH THAT CHURCH IN COMMON WITH EVERY OTHER CHRISTIAN SOCIETY RECOGNISES AS BINDING THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MARKED DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIS EARLIER AND HIS LATER COMPOSITIONS
1595-132753-0014 EVEN WHEN HE PROFESSED TO TRANSLATE HE CONSTANTLY WANDERED FROM HIS ORIGINALS IN SEARCH OF IMAGES WHICH IF HE HAD FOUND THEM IN HIS ORIGINALS HE OUGHT TO HAVE SHUNNED WHAT WAS BAD BECAME WORSE IN HIS VERSIONS
1595-132753-0015 WHAT WAS INNOCENT CONTRACTED A TAINT FROM PASSING THROUGH HIS MIND HE MADE THE GROSSEST SATIRES OF JUVENAL MORE GROSS INTERPOLATED LOOSE DESCRIPTIONS IN THE TALES OF BOCCACCIO AND POLLUTED THE SWEET AND LIMPID POETRY OF THE GEORGICS
1595-132753-0016 THEY COULD NOT DISGUISE FROM THEMSELVES THE FACT THAT THEIR STYLE
1595-132753-0017 THE FIRST SERVICE WHICH HE WAS REQUIRED TO PERFORM IN RETURN FOR HIS PENSION WAS TO DEFEND HIS CHURCH IN PROSE AGAINST STILLINGFLEET BUT THE ART OF SAYING THINGS WELL IS USELESS TO A MAN WHO HAS NOTHING TO SAY AND THIS WAS DRYDEN'S CASE
1595-132753-0018 HE SOON FOUND HIMSELF UNEQUALLY PAIRED WITH AN ANTAGONIST WHOSE WHOLE LIFE HAD BEEN ONE LONG TRAINING FOR CONTROVERSY THE VETERAN GLADIATOR DISARMED THE NOVICE INFLICTED A FEW CONTEMPTUOUS SCRATCHES
1595-132753-0019 AND TURNED AWAY TO ENCOUNTER MORE FORMIDABLE COMBATANTS DRYDEN THEN BETOOK HIMSELF TO A WEAPON AT WHICH HE WAS NOT LIKELY TO FIND HIS MATCH HE RETIRED FOR A TIME FROM THE BUSTLE OF COFFEEHOUSES AND THEATRES
1595-132753-0020 TO A QUIET RETREAT IN HUNTINGDONSHIRE AND THERE COMPOSED WITH UNWONTED CARE AND LABOUR HIS CELEBRATED POEM ON THE POINTS IN DISPUTE BETWEEN THE CHURCHES OF ROME AND ENGLAND
1595-132753-0021 EVER IN PERIL OF DEATH YET FATED NOT TO DIE THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD WERE BENT ON HER DESTRUCTION THE QUAKING HARE INDEED OBSERVED A TIMOROUS NEUTRALITY BUT THE SOCINIAN FOX THE PRESBYTERIAN WOLF THE INDEPENDENT BEAR
1595-132753-0022 THE ANABAPTIST BOAR GLARED FIERCELY AT THE SPOTLESS CREATURE YET SHE COULD VENTURE TO DRINK WITH THEM AT THE COMMON WATERING PLACE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF HER FRIEND THE KINGLY LION THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND WAS TYPIFIED BY THE PANTHER
1595-132753-0023 AND WHILE WAGGING THEIR TAILS AND LICKING THEIR JAWS HELD A LONG DIALOGUE TOUCHING THE REAL PRESENCE THE AUTHORITY OF POPES AND COUNCILS THE PENAL LAWS THE TEST ACT OATES'S PERJURIES BUTLER'S UNREQUITED SERVICES TO THE CAVALIER PARTY
1595-132753-0024 STILLINGFLEET'S PAMPHLETS AND BURNET'S BROAD SHOULDERS AND FORTUNATE MATRIMONIAL SPECULATIONS THE ABSURDITY OF THIS PLAN IS OBVIOUS IN TRUTH THE ALLEGORY COULD NOT BE PRESERVED UNBROKEN THROUGH TEN LINES TOGETHER
1595-132753-0025 THE POEM APPEARED WITH EVERY ADVANTAGE WHICH ROYAL PATRONAGE COULD GIVE A SUPERB EDITION WAS PRINTED FOR SCOTLAND AT THE ROMAN CATHOLIC PRESS ESTABLISHED IN HOLYROOD HOUSE BUT MEN WERE IN NO HUMOUR TO BE CHARMED BY THE TRANSPARENT STYLE
1595-132753-0026 AND MELODIOUS NUMBERS OF THE APOSTATE THE DISGUST EXCITED BY HIS VENALITY THE ALARM EXCITED BY THE POLICY OF WHICH HE WAS THE EULOGIST WERE NOT TO BE SUNG TO SLEEP THE JUST INDIGNATION OF THE PUBLIC
1595-132753-0027 SOMETIMES POET SQUAB HE WAS REMINDED THAT IN HIS YOUTH HE HAD PAID TO THE HOUSE OF CROMWELL
1595-132753-0028 WHICH HE WAS NOW PAYING TO THE HOUSE OF STUART ONE SET OF HIS ASSAILANTS MALICIOUSLY REPRINTED THE SARCASTIC VERSES WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN AGAINST POPERY IN DAYS WHEN HE COULD HAVE GOT NOTHING BY BEING A PAPIST
1595-132753-0029 OF THE MANY SATIRICAL PIECES WHICH APPEARED ON THIS OCCASION THE MOST SUCCESSFUL WAS THE JOINT WORK OF TWO YOUNG MEN WHO HAD LATELY COMPLETED THEIR STUDIES AT CAMBRIDGE AND HAD BEEN WELCOMED AS PROMISING NOVICES IN THE LITERARY COFFEE HOUSES OF LONDON
1595-132753-0030 BOTH HAD KEEN AND VIGOROUS MINDS BOTH AFTERWARDS CLIMBED HIGH BOTH UNITED IN A REMARKABLE DEGREE THE LOVE OF LETTERS WITH SKILL IN THOSE DEPARTMENTS OF BUSINESS FOR WHICH MEN OF LETTERS GENERALLY HAVE A STRONG DISTASTE
1595-132753-0031 OF THE FIFTY POETS WHOSE LIVES JOHNSON HAS WRITTEN MONTAGUE AND PRIOR WERE THE ONLY TWO WHO WERE DISTINGUISHED BY AN INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF TRADE AND FINANCE SOON THEIR PATHS DIVERGED WIDELY
1595-132753-0032 THEIR EARLY FRIENDSHIP WAS DISSOLVED ONE OF THEM BECAME THE CHIEF OF THE WHIG PARTY AND WAS IMPEACHED BY THE TORIES THE OTHER WAS ENTRUSTED WITH ALL THE MYSTERIES OF TORY DIPLOMACY AND WAS LONG KEPT CLOSE PRISONER BY THE WHIGS
1595-132753-0033 AT LENGTH AFTER MANY EVENTFUL YEARS THE ASSOCIATES SO LONG PARTED WERE REUNITED IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY WHOEVER HAS READ THE TALE OF THE HIND AND PANTHER WITH ATTENTION
1595-132753-0034 MUST HAVE PERCEIVED THAT WHILE THAT WORK WAS IN PROGRESS A GREAT ALTERATION TOOK PLACE IN THE VIEWS OF THOSE WHO USED DRYDEN AS THEIR INTERPRETER AT FIRST THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IS MENTIONED WITH TENDERNESS AND RESPECT AND IS EXHORTED
1595-132753-0035 TO ALLY HERSELF WITH THE ROMAN CATHOLICS AGAINST THE PURITAN SECTS BUT AT THE CLOSE OF THE POEM
1595-132753-0036 WITH THE ROMAN CATHOLICS AGAINST THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND THIS CHANGE IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE COURT POET WAS INDICATIVE OF A GREAT CHANGE IN THE POLICY OF THE COURT THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF JAMES HAD BEEN TO OBTAIN FOR THE CHURCH OF WHICH HE WAS A MEMBER
1595-132753-0037 NOT ONLY COMPLETE IMMUNITY FROM ALL PENALTIES AND FROM ALL CIVIL DISABILITIES BUT ALSO AN AMPLE SHARE OF ECCLESIASTICAL AND ACADEMICAL ENDOWMENTS AND AT THE SAME TIME TO ENFORCE WITH RIGOUR THE LAWS AGAINST THE PURITAN SECTS
1595-132753-0038 AT THE COUNCIL BOARD WHILE MASSEY HELD A DEANERY
1595-132753-0039 WHILE THE HOST WAS PUBLICLY EXPOSED IN LONDON UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE PIKES AND MUSKETS OF THE FOOTGUARDS WHILE FRIARS AND MONKS WALKED THE STREETS OF LONDON IN THEIR ROBES
1595-132753-0040 PURITAN WRITERS WERE COMPELLED TO RESORT TO FOREIGN OR TO SECRET PRESSES PURITAN CONGREGATIONS COULD MEET ONLY BY NIGHT OR IN WASTE PLACES AND PURITAN MINISTERS WERE FORCED TO PREACH IN THE GARB OF COLLIERS OR OF SAILORS
1595-132753-0041 IN SCOTLAND THE KING WHILE HE SPARED NO EXERTION TO EXTORT FROM THE ESTATES FULL RELIEF FOR ROMAN CATHOLICS HAD DEMANDED AND OBTAINED NEW STATUTES OF UNPRECEDENTED SEVERITY AGAINST THE PRESBYTERIANS
1595-132753-0042 HE IN VIOLATION OF EVERY LAW OF HOSPITALITY AND GOOD FAITH REQUIRED THEM TO RENOUNCE THE CALVINISTIC RITUAL TO WHICH THEY WERE STRONGLY ATTACHED AND TO CONFORM TO THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND BEFORE HE WOULD DOLE OUT TO THEM ANY PORTION OF THE ALMS
1595-132753-0043 WHICH HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED TO HIS CARE SUCH HAD BEEN HIS POLICY AS LONG AS HE COULD CHERISH ANY HOPE THAT THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND WOULD CONSENT TO SHARE ASCENDENCY WITH THE CHURCH OF ROME THAT HOPE AT ONE TIME AMOUNTED TO CONFIDENCE
1595-132753-0044 THE ENTHUSIASM WITH WHICH THE TORIES HAD HAILED HIS ACCESSION THE ELECTIONS THE DUTIFUL LANGUAGE AND AMPLE GRANTS OF HIS PARLIAMENT
1595-132753-0045 THE SUPPRESSION OF THE WESTERN INSURRECTION THE COMPLETE PROSTRATION OF THE PARTY WHICH HAD ATTEMPTED TO EXCLUDE HIM FROM THE CROWN ELATED HIM BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF REASON HE FELT AN ASSURANCE THAT EVERY OBSTACLE WOULD GIVE WAY BEFORE HIS POWER AND HIS RESOLUTION
1595-132753-0046 HIS PARLIAMENT WITHSTOOD HIM HE TRIED THE EFFECTS OF FROWNS AND MENACES FROWNS AND MENACES FAILED HE TRIED THE EFFECT OF PROROGATION FROM THE DAY OF THE PROROGATION THE OPPOSITION TO HIS DESIGNS HAD BEEN GROWING STRONGER AND STRONGER
1595-132753-0047 HE MUST EFFECT IT IN DEFIANCE OF THAT GREAT PARTY WHICH HAD GIVEN SUCH SIGNAL PROOFS OF FIDELITY TO HIS OFFICE TO HIS FAMILY AND TO HIS PERSON THE WHOLE ANGLICAN PRIESTHOOD THE WHOLE CAVALIER GENTRY WERE AGAINST HIM
1595-132753-0048 IN VAIN HAD HE BY VIRTUE OF HIS ECCLESIASTICAL SUPREMACY ENJOINED THE CLERGY TO ABSTAIN FROM DISCUSSING CONTROVERTED POINTS EVERY PARISH IN THE NATION
1595-132753-0049 WAS WARNED EVERY SUNDAY AGAINST THE ERRORS OF ROME AND THESE WARNINGS WERE ONLY THE MORE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE THEY WERE ACCOMPANIED BY PROFESSIONS OF REVERENCE FOR THE SOVEREIGN
1595-132753-0050 NOW EXPRESSED IN NO MEASURED PHRASE THEIR RESOLUTION TO STAND AS MANFULLY BY THE CHURCH DULL AS WAS THE INTELLECT OF JAMES DESPOTIC AS WAS HIS TEMPER HE FELT THAT HE MUST CHANGE HIS COURSE
1595-132753-0051 HE COULD NOT SAFELY VENTURE TO OUTRAGE ALL HIS PROTESTANT SUBJECTS AT ONCE IF HE COULD BRING HIMSELF TO MAKE CONCESSIONS TO THE PARTY WHICH PREDOMINATED IN BOTH HOUSES IF HE COULD BRING HIMSELF
1595-132753-0052 EMOLUMENTS AND PRIVILEGES UNIMPAIRED HE MIGHT STILL BREAK UP PRESBYTERIAN MEETINGS
1595-132753-0053 HE COULD OVERPOWER THE ANGLICAN CHURCH ONLY BY FORMING AGAINST HER AN EXTENSIVE COALITION INCLUDING SECTS WHICH THOUGH THEY DIFFERED IN DOCTRINE AND GOVERNMENT FAR MORE WIDELY FROM EACH OTHER THAN FROM HER
1595-132753-0054 MIGHT YET BE INDUCED BY THEIR COMMON JEALOUSY OF HER GREATNESS AND BY THEIR COMMON DREAD OF HER INTOLERANCE TO SUSPEND THEIR ANIMOSITIES TILL SHE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO OPPRESS THEM THIS PLAN SEEMED TO HIM TO HAVE ONE STRONG RECOMMENDATION
1595-132753-0055 IF HE COULD ONLY SUCCEED IN CONCILIATING THE PROTESTANT NONCONFORMISTS HE MIGHT FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE WAS SECURE AGAINST ALL CHANCE OF REBELLION ACCORDING TO THE ANGLICAN DIVINES NO SUBJECT COULD BY ANY PROVOCATION BE JUSTIFIED
1595-132753-0056 IN WITHSTANDING THE LORD'S ANOINTED BY FORCE THE THEORY OF THE PURITAN SECTARIES WAS VERY DIFFERENT THOSE SECTARIES HAD NO SCRUPLE ABOUT SMITING TYRANTS WITH THE SWORD OF GIDEON MANY OF THEM
1595-132753-0057 THEY WERE PROBABLY EVEN NOW MEDITATING ANOTHER WESTERN INSURRECTION OR ANOTHER RYE HOUSE PLOT JAMES THEREFORE CONCEIVED THAT HE MIGHT SAFELY PERSECUTE THE CHURCH IF HE COULD ONLY GAIN THE DISSENTERS
1595-132753-0058 THE PARTY WHOSE PRINCIPLES AFFORDED HIM NO GUARANTEE WOULD BE ATTACHED TO HIM BY INTEREST THE PARTY WHOSE INTERESTS HE ATTACKED WOULD BE RESTRAINED FROM INSURRECTION BY PRINCIPLE
1595-132753-0059 INFLUENCED BY SUCH CONSIDERATIONS AS THESE JAMES FROM THE TIME AT WHICH HE PARTED IN ANGER WITH HIS PARLIAMENT BEGAN TO MEDITATE A GENERAL LEAGUE OF ALL NONCONFORMISTS CATHOLIC AND PROTESTANT AGAINST THE ESTABLISHED RELIGION
1595-132753-0060 WITH ALL THAT HE MOST ABHORRED HE HAD TO OVERCOME AN ANIMOSITY NOT SLIGHT OR CAPRICIOUS NOT OF RECENT ORIGIN OR HASTY GROWTH
1595-132753-0061 STRENGTHENED BY GREAT WRONGS INFLICTED AND SUFFERED THROUGH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY EVENTFUL YEARS AND INTERTWINED WITH ALL HIS FEELINGS RELIGIOUS POLITICAL DOMESTIC AND PERSONAL FOUR GENERATIONS OF STUARTS
1595-132753-0062 HAD WAGED A WAR TO THE DEATH WITH FOUR GENERATIONS OF PURITANS AND THROUGH THAT LONG WAR THERE HAD BEEN NO STUART WHO HAD HATED THE PURITANS SO MUCH OR WHO HAD BEEN SO MUCH HATED BY THEM AS HIMSELF
1595-132753-0063 THEY HAD TRIED TO BLAST HIS HONOUR AND TO EXCLUDE HIM FROM HIS BIRTHRIGHT THEY HAD CALLED HIM INCENDIARY CUTTHROAT POISONER THEY HAD DRIVEN HIM FROM THE ADMIRALTY AND THE PRIVY COUNCIL
1595-132753-0064 THEY HAD REPEATEDLY CHASED HIM INTO BANISHMENT THEY HAD PLOTTED HIS ASSASSINATION
1595-132753-0065 HE HAD AVENGED HIMSELF ON THEM BY HAVOC SUCH AS ENGLAND HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN THEIR HEADS AND QUARTERS WERE STILL ROTTING ON POLES IN ALL THE MARKET PLACES
1595-132753-0066 AGED WOMEN HELD IN HIGH HONOUR AMONG THE SECTARIES FOR PIETY AND CHARITY HAD FOR OFFENCES WHICH NO GOOD PRINCE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT DESERVING EVEN OF A SEVERE REPRIMAND BEEN BEHEADED AND BURNED ALIVE
