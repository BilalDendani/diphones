1296-134434-0000 THERE WERE ALWAYS THREE OR FOUR OLD PEOPLE SITTING ON THE FRONT PORCH OF THE HOUSE OR PUTTERING ABOUT THE GARDEN OF THE BENTLEY FARM THREE OF THE OLD PEOPLE WERE WOMEN AND SISTERS TO JESSE
1296-134434-0001 THEY WERE A COLORLESS SOFT VOICED LOT THEN THERE WAS A SILENT OLD MAN WITH THIN WHITE HAIR WHO WAS JESSE'S UNCLE THE FARMHOUSE WAS BUILT OF WOOD
1296-134434-0002 A BOARD OUTER COVERING OVER A FRAMEWORK OF LOGS IT WAS IN REALITY NOT ONE HOUSE BUT A CLUSTER OF HOUSES JOINED TOGETHER IN A RATHER HAPHAZARD MANNER
1296-134434-0003 AT MEAL TIMES THE PLACE WAS LIKE A BEEHIVE AT ONE MOMENT ALL WAS QUIET THEN DOORS BEGAN TO OPEN FEET CLATTERED ON STAIRS
1296-134434-0004 A MURMUR OF SOFT VOICES AROSE AND PEOPLE APPEARED FROM A DOZEN OBSCURE CORNERS BESIDES THE OLD PEOPLE ALREADY MENTIONED MANY OTHERS LIVED IN THE BENTLEY HOUSE THERE WERE FOUR HIRED MEN
1296-134434-0005 WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE HOUSEKEEPING A DULL WITTED GIRL NAMED ELIZA STOUGHTON WHO MADE BEDS AND HELPED WITH THE MILKING A BOY WHO WORKED IN THE STABLES AND JESSE BENTLEY HIMSELF THE OWNER AND OVERLORD OF IT ALL
1296-134434-0006 BY THE TIME THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR HAD BEEN OVER FOR TWENTY YEARS THAT PART OF NORTHERN OHIO WHERE THE BENTLEY FARMS LAY HAD BEGUN TO EMERGE FROM PIONEER LIFE
1296-134434-0007 JESSE THEN OWNED MACHINERY FOR HARVESTING GRAIN HE HAD BUILT MODERN BARNS AND MOST OF HIS LAND WAS DRAINED WITH CAREFULLY LAID TILE DRAIN BUT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE MAN
1296-134434-0008 WE WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO AN EARLIER DAY THE BENTLEY FAMILY HAD BEEN IN NORTHERN OHIO FOR SEVERAL GENERATIONS BEFORE JESSE'S TIME THEY CAME FROM NEW YORK STATE AND TOOK UP LAND WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS NEW
1296-134434-0009 AND LAND COULD BE HAD AT A LOW PRICE FOR A LONG TIME THEY IN COMMON WITH ALL THE OTHER MIDDLE WESTERN PEOPLE WERE VERY POOR THE LAND THEY HAD SETTLED UPON WAS HEAVILY WOODED
1296-134434-0010 AND COVERED WITH FALLEN LOGS AND UNDERBRUSH AFTER THE LONG HARD LABOR OF CLEARING THESE AWAY AND CUTTING THE TIMBER THERE WERE STILL THE STUMPS TO BE RECKONED WITH PLOWS RUN THROUGH THE FIELDS CAUGHT ON HIDDEN ROOTS
1296-134434-0011 STONES LAY ALL ABOUT ON THE LOW PLACES WATER GATHERED AND THE YOUNG CORN TURNED YELLOW SICKENED AND DIED WHEN JESSE BENTLEY'S FATHER AND BROTHERS HAD COME INTO THEIR OWNERSHIP OF THE PLACE
1296-134434-0012 MUCH OF THE HARDER PART OF THE WORK OF CLEARING HAD BEEN DONE BUT THEY CLUNG TO OLD TRADITIONS AND WORKED LIKE DRIVEN ANIMALS THEY LIVED AS PRACTICALLY ALL OF THE FARMING PEOPLE OF THE TIME LIVED
1296-134434-0013 IN THE SPRING AND THROUGH MOST OF THE WINTER THE HIGHWAYS LEADING INTO THE TOWN OF WINESBURG WERE A SEA OF MUD THE FOUR YOUNG MEN OF THE FAMILY WORKED HARD ALL DAY IN THE FIELDS THEY ATE HEAVILY OF COARSE GREASY FOOD
1296-134434-0014 AND AT NIGHT SLEPT LIKE TIRED BEASTS ON BEDS OF STRAW INTO THEIR LIVES CAME LITTLE THAT WAS NOT COARSE AND BRUTAL AND OUTWARDLY THEY WERE THEMSELVES COARSE AND BRUTAL
1296-134434-0015 ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS THEY HITCHED A TEAM OF HORSES TO A THREE SEATED WAGON AND WENT OFF TO TOWN IN TOWN THEY STOOD ABOUT THE STOVES IN THE STORES TALKING TO OTHER FARMERS OR TO THE STORE KEEPERS
1296-134434-0016 THEY WERE DRESSED IN OVERALLS AND IN THE WINTER WORE HEAVY COATS THAT WERE FLECKED WITH MUD THEIR HANDS AS THEY STRETCHED THEM OUT TO THE HEAT OF THE STOVES WERE CRACKED AND RED IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO TALK
1296-134434-0017 AND SO THEY FOR THE MOST PART KEPT SILENT WHEN THEY HAD BOUGHT MEAT FLOUR SUGAR AND SALT THEY WENT INTO ONE OF THE WINESBURG SALOONS AND DRANK BEER
1296-134434-0018 UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRINK THE NATURALLY STRONG LUSTS OF THEIR NATURES KEPT SUPPRESSED BY THE HEROIC LABOR OF BREAKING UP NEW GROUND WERE RELEASED A KIND OF CRUDE AND ANIMAL LIKE POETIC FERVOR
1296-134434-0019 TOOK POSSESSION OF THEM ON THE ROAD HOME THEY STOOD UP ON THE WAGON SEATS AND SHOUTED AT THE STARS SOMETIMES THEY FOUGHT LONG AND BITTERLY AND AT OTHER TIMES THEY BROKE FORTH INTO SONGS
1296-134434-0020 ONCE ENOCH BENTLEY THE OLDER ONE OF THE BOYS STRUCK HIS FATHER OLD TOM BENTLEY WITH THE BUTT OF A TEAMSTER'S WHIP AND THE OLD MAN SEEMED LIKELY TO DIE FOR DAYS ENOCH LAY HID IN THE STRAW IN THE LOFT OF THE STABLE
1296-134434-0021 READY TO FLEE IF THE RESULT OF HIS MOMENTARY PASSION TURNED OUT TO BE MURDER HE WAS KEPT ALIVE WITH FOOD BROUGHT BY HIS MOTHER WHO ALSO KEPT HIM INFORMED OF THE INJURED MAN'S CONDITION
1296-134434-0022 WHEN ALL TURNED OUT WELL HE EMERGED FROM HIS HIDING PLACE AND WENT BACK TO THE WORK OF CLEARING LAND AS THOUGH NOTHING HAD HAPPENED THE CIVIL WAR BROUGHT A SHARP TURN TO THE FORTUNES OF THE BENTLEYS
1296-134434-0023 AND WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RISE OF THE YOUNGEST SON JESSE ENOCH EDWARD HARRY AND WILL BENTLEY ALL ENLISTED AND BEFORE THE LONG WAR ENDED THEY WERE ALL KILLED FOR A TIME AFTER THEY WENT AWAY TO THE SOUTH
1296-134434-0024 DIED SUDDENLY AND THE FATHER BECAME ALTOGETHER DISCOURAGED HE TALKED OF SELLING THE FARM AND MOVING INTO TOWN ALL DAY HE WENT ABOUT SHAKING HIS HEAD AND MUTTERING
1296-134434-0025 THE WORK IN THE FIELDS WAS NEGLECTED AND WEEDS GREW HIGH IN THE CORN OLD TOM HIRED MEN BUT HE DID NOT USE THEM INTELLIGENTLY WHEN THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO THE FIELDS IN THE MORNING HE WANDERED INTO THE WOODS AND SAT DOWN ON A LOG
1296-134434-0026 AT EIGHTEEN HE HAD LEFT HOME TO GO TO SCHOOL TO BECOME A SCHOLAR AND EVENTUALLY TO BECOME A MINISTER OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH ALL THROUGH HIS BOYHOOD HE HAD BEEN WHAT IN OUR COUNTRY WAS CALLED AN ODD SHEEP
1296-134434-0027 AND HAD NOT GOT ON WITH HIS BROTHERS OF ALL THE FAMILY ONLY HIS MOTHER HAD UNDERSTOOD HIM AND SHE WAS NOW DEAD WHEN HE CAME HOME TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE FARM THAT HAD AT THAT TIME GROWN TO MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED ACRES
1296-134434-0028 EVERYONE ON THE FARMS ABOUT AND IN THE NEARBY TOWN OF WINESBURG SMILED AT THE IDEA OF HIS TRYING TO HANDLE THE WORK THAT HAD BEEN DONE BY HIS FOUR STRONG BROTHERS
1296-134434-0029 THERE WAS INDEED GOOD CAUSE TO SMILE BY THE STANDARDS OF HIS DAY JESSE DID NOT LOOK LIKE A MAN AT ALL HE WAS SMALL AND VERY SLENDER AND WOMANISH OF BODY AND TRUE TO THE TRADITIONS OF YOUNG MINISTERS
1296-134434-0030 WORE A LONG BLACK COAT AND A NARROW BLACK STRING TIE THE NEIGHBORS WERE AMUSED WHEN THEY SAW HIM AFTER THE YEARS AWAY AND THEY WERE EVEN MORE AMUSED WHEN THEY SAW THE WOMAN HE HAD MARRIED IN THE CITY
1296-134434-0031 AS A MATTER OF FACT JESSE'S WIFE DID SOON GO UNDER THAT WAS PERHAPS JESSE'S FAULT A FARM IN NORTHERN OHIO IN THE HARD YEARS AFTER THE CIVIL WAR WAS NO PLACE FOR A DELICATE WOMAN
1296-134434-0032 SHE HELPED TO DO THE MILKING AND DID PART OF THE HOUSEWORK SHE MADE THE BEDS FOR THE MEN AND PREPARED THEIR FOOD FOR A YEAR SHE WORKED EVERY DAY FROM SUNRISE UNTIL LATE AT NIGHT AND THEN AFTER GIVING BIRTH TO A CHILD SHE DIED
1296-134434-0033 AS FOR JESSE BENTLEY ALTHOUGH HE WAS A DELICATELY BUILT MAN THERE WAS SOMETHING WITHIN HIM THAT COULD NOT EASILY BE KILLED HE HAD BROWN CURLY HAIR AND GREY EYES THAT WERE AT TIMES HARD AND DIRECT
1296-134434-0034 AT TIMES WAVERING AND UNCERTAIN NOT ONLY WAS HE SLENDER BUT HE WAS ALSO SHORT OF STATURE HIS MOUTH WAS LIKE THE MOUTH OF A SENSITIVE AND VERY DETERMINED CHILD JESSE BENTLEY WAS A FANATIC
1296-134434-0035 WITHIN A VERY SHORT TIME AFTER HE CAME HOME TO THE BENTLEY FARM HE MADE EVERYONE THERE A LITTLE AFRAID OF HIM AND HIS WIFE WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSE TO HIM AS HIS MOTHER HAD BEEN WAS AFRAID ALSO
1296-134434-0036 AT THE END OF TWO WEEKS AFTER HIS COMING OLD TOM BENTLEY MADE OVER TO HIM THE ENTIRE OWNERSHIP OF THE PLACE AND RETIRED INTO THE BACKGROUND EVERYONE RETIRED INTO THE BACKGROUND
1296-134434-0037 IN SPITE OF HIS YOUTH AND INEXPERIENCE JESSE HAD THE TRICK OF MASTERING THE SOULS OF HIS PEOPLE
1296-134434-0038 THAT NO ONE UNDERSTOOD HIM HE MADE EVERYONE ON THE FARM WORK AS THEY HAD NEVER WORKED BEFORE AND YET THERE WAS NO JOY IN THE WORK IF THINGS WENT WELL THEY WENT WELL FOR JESSE AND NEVER FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE HIS DEPENDENTS
1296-134434-0039 LIKE A THOUSAND OTHER STRONG MEN WHO HAVE COME INTO THE WORLD HERE IN AMERICA IN THESE LATER TIMES JESSE WAS BUT HALF STRONG HE COULD MASTER OTHERS BUT HE COULD NOT MASTER HIMSELF
1296-134434-0040 THE RUNNING OF THE FARM AS IT HAD NEVER BEEN RUN BEFORE WAS EASY FOR HIM WHEN HE CAME HOME FROM CLEVELAND WHERE HE HAD BEEN IN SCHOOL HE SHUT HIMSELF OFF FROM ALL OF HIS PEOPLE AND BEGAN TO MAKE PLANS
1296-134434-0041 HE THOUGHT ABOUT THE FARM NIGHT AND DAY AND THAT MADE HIM SUCCESSFUL
1296-134434-0042 BUT TO THINK OF THE FARM AND TO BE EVERLASTINGLY MAKING PLANS FOR ITS SUCCESS WAS A RELIEF TO JESSE
