37-215-0000 WITH A MIND THUS FULL OF HAPPINESS CATHERINE WAS HARDLY AWARE THAT TWO OR THREE DAYS HAD PASSED AWAY WITHOUT HER SEEING ISABELLA FOR MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES TOGETHER SHE BEGAN FIRST TO BE SENSIBLE OF THIS AND TO SIGH FOR HER CONVERSATION
37-215-0001 AS SHE WALKED ALONG THE PUMP ROOM ONE MORNING BY MISSUS ALLEN'S SIDE WITHOUT ANYTHING TO SAY OR TO HEAR AND SCARCELY HAD SHE FELT A FIVE MINUTES LONGING OF FRIENDSHIP BEFORE THE OBJECT OF IT APPEARED
37-215-0002 WHICH COMMANDED A TOLERABLE VIEW OF EVERYBODY ENTERING AT EITHER IT IS SO OUT OF THE WAY CATHERINE OBSERVING THAT ISABELLA'S EYES WERE CONTINUALLY BENT TOWARDS ONE DOOR OR THE OTHER AS IN EAGER EXPECTATION AND REMEMBERING HOW OFTEN
37-215-0003 SHE HAD BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED OF BEING ARCH THOUGHT THE PRESENT A FINE OPPORTUNITY FOR BEING REALLY SO AND THEREFORE GAILY SAID DO NOT BE UNEASY ISABELLA JAMES WILL SOON BE HERE PSHA MY DEAR CREATURE SHE REPLIED DO NOT THINK
37-215-0004 ME SUCH A SIMPLETON AS TO BE ALWAYS WANTING TO CONFINE HIM TO MY ELBOW IT WOULD BE HIDEOUS TO BE ALWAYS TOGETHER WE SHOULD BE THE JEST OF THE PLACE AND SO YOU ARE GOING TO NORTHANGER I AM AMAZINGLY GLAD OF IT
37-215-0005 IT IS ONE OF THE FINEST OLD PLACES IN ENGLAND I UNDERSTAND I SHALL DEPEND UPON A MOST PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION OF IT YOU SHALL CERTAINLY HAVE THE BEST IN MY POWER TO GIVE BUT WHO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ARE YOUR SISTERS COMING
37-215-0006 TILNEY SAYS IT IS ALWAYS THE CASE WITH MINDS OF A CERTAIN STAMP BUT I THOUGHT ISABELLA YOU HAD SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR TO TELL ME OH YES AND SO I HAVE BUT HERE IS A PROOF OF WHAT I WAS SAYING
37-215-0007 MY POOR HEAD I HAD QUITE FORGOT IT WELL THE THING IS THIS I HAVE JUST HAD A LETTER FROM JOHN YOU CAN GUESS THE CONTENTS NO INDEED I CANNOT MY SWEET LOVE
37-215-0008 WHAT CAN HE WRITE ABOUT BUT YOURSELF YOU KNOW HE IS OVER HEAD AND EARS IN LOVE WITH YOU WITH ME DEAR ISABELLA NAY MY SWEETEST CATHERINE THIS IS BEING QUITE ABSURD
37-215-0009 MODESTY AND ALL THAT IS VERY WELL IN ITS WAY BUT REALLY A LITTLE COMMON HONESTY IS SOMETIMES QUITE AS BECOMING I HAVE NO IDEA OF BEING SO OVERSTRAINED IT IS FISHING FOR COMPLIMENTS HIS ATTENTIONS WERE SUCH AS A CHILD MUST HAVE NOTICED
37-215-0010 AND IT WAS BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HE LEFT BATH THAT YOU GAVE HIM THE MOST POSITIVE ENCOURAGEMENT HE SAYS SO IN THIS LETTER SAYS THAT HE AS GOOD AS MADE YOU AN OFFER
37-215-0011 SO IT IS IN VAIN TO AFFECT IGNORANCE
37-215-0012 PROTESTING HER INNOCENCE OF EVERY THOUGHT OF MISTER THORPE'S BEING IN LOVE WITH HER AND THE CONSEQUENT IMPOSSIBILITY OF HER HAVING EVER INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE HIM
37-215-0013 AS TO ANY ATTENTIONS ON HIS SIDE I DO DECLARE UPON MY HONOUR I NEVER WAS SENSIBLE OF THEM FOR A MOMENT EXCEPT JUST HIS ASKING ME TO DANCE THE FIRST DAY OF HIS COMING
37-215-0014 I COULD NOT HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD A THING OF THAT KIND YOU KNOW
37-215-0015 WELL IF YOU SAY IT IT WAS SO I DARE SAY BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CANNOT RECOLLECT IT I DO REMEMBER NOW BEING WITH YOU AND SEEING HIM AS WELL AS THE REST BUT THAT WE WERE
37-215-0016 HOWEVER IT IS NOT WORTH ARGUING ABOUT FOR WHATEVER MIGHT PASS ON HIS SIDE YOU MUST BE CONVINCED BY MY HAVING NO RECOLLECTION OF IT THAT I NEVER THOUGHT NOR EXPECTED NOR WISHED FOR ANYTHING OF THE KIND FROM HIM
37-215-0017 I AM EXCESSIVELY CONCERNED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE ANY REGARD FOR ME BUT INDEED IT HAS BEEN QUITE UNINTENTIONAL ON MY SIDE I NEVER HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA OF IT PRAY UNDECEIVE HIM AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND TELL HIM I BEG HIS PARDON THAT IS
37-215-0018 I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN IN THE PROPEREST WAY I WOULD NOT SPEAK DISRESPECTFULLY OF A BROTHER OF YOURS ISABELLA I AM SURE BUT YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT IF I COULD THINK OF ONE MAN MORE THAN ANOTHER
37-215-0019 ISABELLA WAS SILENT MY DEAR FRIEND YOU MUST NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME I CANNOT SUPPOSE YOUR BROTHER CARES SO VERY MUCH ABOUT ME AND YOU KNOW WE SHALL STILL BE SISTERS
37-215-0020 WELL MY DEAR CATHERINE THE CASE SEEMS TO BE THAT YOU ARE DETERMINED AGAINST POOR JOHN IS NOT IT SO
37-215-0021 SINCE THAT IS THE CASE I AM SURE I SHALL NOT TEASE YOU ANY FURTHER
37-215-0022 BUT I CONFESS AS SOON AS I READ HIS LETTER I THOUGHT IT A VERY FOOLISH IMPRUDENT BUSINESS AND NOT LIKELY TO PROMOTE THE GOOD OF EITHER FOR WHAT WERE YOU TO LIVE UPON SUPPOSING YOU CAME TOGETHER YOU HAVE BOTH OF YOU SOMETHING TO BE SURE
37-215-0023 BUT IT IS NOT A TRIFLE THAT WILL SUPPORT A FAMILY NOWADAYS AND AFTER ALL THAT ROMANCERS MAY SAY THERE IS NO DOING WITHOUT MONEY I ONLY WONDER JOHN COULD THINK OF IT HE COULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED MY LAST YOU DO ACQUIT ME THEN OF ANYTHING WRONG
37-215-0024 YOU ARE CONVINCED THAT I NEVER MEANT TO DECEIVE YOUR BROTHER NEVER SUSPECTED HIM OF LIKING ME TILL THIS MOMENT OH AS TO THAT ANSWERED ISABELLA LAUGHINGLY
37-215-0025 MORE ENCOURAGEMENT THAN ONE WISHES TO STAND BY BUT YOU MAY BE ASSURED THAT I AM THE LAST PERSON IN THE WORLD TO JUDGE YOU SEVERELY ALL THOSE THINGS SHOULD BE ALLOWED FOR IN YOUTH AND HIGH SPIRITS WHAT ONE MEANS ONE DAY YOU KNOW ONE MAY NOT MEAN THE NEXT
37-215-0026 CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE OPINIONS ALTER BUT MY OPINION OF YOUR BROTHER NEVER DID ALTER IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME YOU ARE DESCRIBING WHAT NEVER HAPPENED MY DEAREST CATHERINE CONTINUED THE OTHER WITHOUT AT ALL LISTENING TO HER
37-215-0027 I WOULD NOT FOR ALL THE WORLD BE THE MEANS OF HURRYING YOU INTO AN ENGAGEMENT BEFORE YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE ABOUT I DO NOT THINK ANYTHING WOULD JUSTIFY ME IN WISHING YOU TO SACRIFICE ALL YOUR HAPPINESS MERELY TO OBLIGE MY BROTHER
37-215-0028 BECAUSE HE IS MY BROTHER AND WHO PERHAPS AFTER ALL YOU KNOW MIGHT BE JUST AS HAPPY WITHOUT YOU FOR PEOPLE SELDOM KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD BE AT YOUNG MEN ESPECIALLY THEY ARE SO AMAZINGLY CHANGEABLE AND INCONSTANT
37-215-0029 WHAT I SAY IS WHY SHOULD A BROTHER'S HAPPINESS BE DEARER TO ME THAN A FRIEND'S YOU KNOW I CARRY MY NOTIONS OF FRIENDSHIP PRETTY HIGH
37-215-0030 TAKE MY WORD FOR IT THAT IF YOU ARE IN TOO GREAT A HURRY YOU WILL CERTAINLY LIVE TO REPENT IT
37-215-0031 AH HERE HE COMES NEVER MIND HE WILL NOT SEE US I AM SURE CATHERINE LOOKING UP PERCEIVED CAPTAIN TILNEY AND ISABELLA EARNESTLY FIXING HER EYE ON HIM AS SHE SPOKE SOON CAUGHT HIS NOTICE
37-215-0032 HE APPROACHED IMMEDIATELY AND TOOK THE SEAT TO WHICH HER MOVEMENTS INVITED HIM HIS FIRST ADDRESS MADE CATHERINE START THOUGH SPOKEN LOW SHE COULD DISTINGUISH WHAT
37-215-0033 PSHA NONSENSE WAS ISABELLA'S ANSWER IN THE SAME HALF WHISPER WHY DO YOU PUT SUCH THINGS INTO MY HEAD IF I COULD BELIEVE IT MY SPIRIT YOU KNOW IS PRETTY INDEPENDENT
37-215-0034 THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ME MY HEART INDEED WHAT CAN YOU HAVE TO DO WITH HEARTS YOU MEN HAVE NONE OF YOU ANY HEARTS IF WE HAVE NOT HEARTS WE HAVE EYES AND THEY GIVE US TORMENT ENOUGH
37-215-0035 SHE ROSE UP AND SAYING SHE SHOULD JOIN MISSUS ALLEN PROPOSED THEIR WALKING BUT FOR THIS ISABELLA SHOWED NO INCLINATION SHE WAS SO AMAZINGLY TIRED AND IT WAS SO ODIOUS TO PARADE ABOUT THE PUMP ROOM AND IF SHE MOVED FROM HER SEAT SHE SHOULD MISS HER SISTERS
37-215-0036 SHE WAS EXPECTING HER SISTERS EVERY MOMENT SO THAT HER DEAREST CATHERINE MUST EXCUSE HER AND MUST SIT QUIETLY DOWN AGAIN BUT CATHERINE COULD BE STUBBORN TOO AND MISSUS ALLEN JUST THEN COMING UP TO PROPOSE THEIR RETURNING HOME
37-215-0037 WITH MUCH UNEASINESS DID SHE THUS LEAVE THEM IT SEEMED TO HER THAT CAPTAIN TILNEY WAS FALLING IN LOVE WITH ISABELLA AND ISABELLA UNCONSCIOUSLY ENCOURAGING HIM
37-215-0038 SHE WISHED ISABELLA HAD TALKED MORE LIKE HER USUAL SELF AND NOT SO MUCH ABOUT MONEY AND HAD NOT LOOKED SO WELL PLEASED AT THE SIGHT OF CAPTAIN TILNEY HOW STRANGE THAT SHE SHOULD NOT PERCEIVE HIS ADMIRATION
37-215-0039 THE COMPLIMENT OF JOHN THORPE'S AFFECTION DID NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR THIS THOUGHTLESSNESS IN HIS SISTER SHE WAS ALMOST AS FAR FROM BELIEVING AS FROM WISHING IT TO BE SINCERE FOR SHE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THAT HE COULD MISTAKE
37-215-0040 AND HIS ASSERTION OF THE OFFER AND OF HER ENCOURAGEMENT CONVINCED HER THAT HIS MISTAKES COULD SOMETIMES BE VERY EGREGIOUS IN VANITY THEREFORE
37-215-0041 HER CHIEF PROFIT WAS IN WONDER THAT HE SHOULD THINK IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO FANCY HIMSELF IN LOVE WITH HER WAS A MATTER OF LIVELY ASTONISHMENT
