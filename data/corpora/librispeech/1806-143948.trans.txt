1806-143948-0000 THE OTHER QUICKLY RECOVERED FROM THE ALARM WHICH INDUCED THE EXCLAMATION AND LAUGHING AT HER OWN WEAKNESS SHE INQUIRED OF THE YOUTH WHO RODE BY HER SIDE ARE SUCH SPECTERS FREQUENT IN THE WOODS HEYWARD OR IS THIS SIGHT
1806-143948-0001 WHICH WE BOAST EVEN BEFORE WE ARE MADE TO ENCOUNTER THE REDOUBTABLE MONTCALM YON INDIAN IS A RUNNER OF THE ARMY AND AFTER THE FASHION OF HIS PEOPLE HE MAY BE ACCOUNTED A HERO RETURNED THE OFFICER
1806-143948-0002 SAID THE LADY SHUDDERING PARTLY IN ASSUMED YET MORE IN REAL TERROR YOU KNOW HIM DUNCAN
1806-143948-0003 SAY RATHER ALICE THAT I WOULD NOT TRUST YOU I DO KNOW HIM OR HE WOULD NOT HAVE MY CONFIDENCE AND LEAST OF ALL AT THIS MOMENT HE IS SAID TO BE A CANADIAN TOO AND YET HE SERVED WITH OUR FRIENDS THE MOHAWKS
1806-143948-0004 THE PRIVATE PATH BY WHICH WE ARE TO JOURNEY IS DOUBTLESS AT HAND THE CONJECTURE OF MAJOR HEYWARD WAS TRUE WHEN THEY REACHED THE SPOT WHERE THE INDIAN STOOD POINTING INTO THE THICKET THAT FRINGED THE MILITARY ROAD A NARROW AND BLIND PATH
1806-143948-0005 WHICH MIGHT WITH SOME LITTLE INCONVENIENCE RECEIVE ONE PERSON AT A TIME BECAME VISIBLE HERE THEN LIES OUR WAY SAID THE YOUNG MAN IN A LOW VOICE MANIFEST NO DISTRUST OR YOU MAY INVITE THE DANGER YOU APPEAR TO APPREHEND
1806-143948-0006 CORA WHAT THINK YOU ASKED THE RELUCTANT FAIR ONE IF WE JOURNEY WITH THE TROOPS THOUGH WE MAY FIND THEIR PRESENCE IRKSOME SHALL WE NOT FEEL BETTER ASSURANCE OF OUR SAFETY
1806-143948-0007 YOU MISTAKE THE PLACE OF REAL DANGER SAID HEYWARD IF ENEMIES HAVE REACHED THE PORTAGE AT ALL A THING BY NO MEANS PROBABLE AS OUR SCOUTS ARE ABROAD THEY WILL SURELY BE FOUND SKIRTING THE COLUMN
1806-143948-0008 THE ROUTE OF THE DETACHMENT IS KNOWN WHILE OURS HAVING BEEN DETERMINED WITHIN THE HOUR MUST STILL BE SECRET SHOULD WE DISTRUST THE MAN BECAUSE HIS MANNERS ARE NOT OUR MANNERS AND THAT HIS SKIN IS DARK COLDLY ASKED CORA
1806-143948-0009 ALICE HESITATED NO LONGER BUT GIVING HER NARRANGANSETT A SMART CUT OF THE WHIP SHE WAS THE FIRST TO DASH ASIDE THE SLIGHT BRANCHES OF THE BUSHES AND TO FOLLOW THE RUNNER ALONG THE DARK AND TANGLED PATHWAY
1806-143948-0010 THE CANADIAN SAVAGES SHOULD BE LURKING SO FAR IN ADVANCE OF THEIR ARMY FOR MANY MINUTES THE INTRICACY OF THE ROUTE ADMITTED OF NO FURTHER DIALOGUE AFTER WHICH THEY EMERGED FROM THE BROAD BORDER OF UNDERBRUSH WHICH GREW ALONG THE LINE OF THE HIGHWAY
1806-143948-0011 AND ENTERED UNDER THE HIGH BUT DARK ARCHES OF THE FOREST HERE THEIR PROGRESS WAS LESS INTERRUPTED AND THE INSTANT THE GUIDE PERCEIVED THAT THE FEMALES COULD COMMAND THEIR STEEDS HE MOVED ON AT A PACE BETWEEN A TROT AND A WALK
1806-143948-0012 HIS MEAGER BEAST TO ENDURE WITHOUT COMING TO AN OPEN RUPTURE UNTIL NOW THIS PERSONAGE HAD ESCAPED THE OBSERVATION OF THE TRAVELERS IF HE POSSESSED THE POWER TO ARREST ANY WANDERING EYE WHEN EXHIBITING THE GLORIES OF HIS ALTITUDE ON FOOT
1806-143948-0013 HIS EQUESTRIAN GRACES WERE STILL MORE LIKELY TO ATTRACT ATTENTION NOTWITHSTANDING A CONSTANT APPLICATION OF HIS ONE ARMED HEEL TO THE FLANKS OF THE MARE THE MOST CONFIRMED GAIT THAT HE COULD ESTABLISH WAS A CANTERBURY GALLOP WITH THE HIND LEGS
1806-143948-0014 FOR IT IS CERTAIN THAT HEYWARD WHO POSSESSED A TRUE EYE FOR THE MERITS OF A HORSE WAS UNABLE WITH HIS UTMOST INGENUITY TO DECIDE BY WHAT SORT OF MOVEMENT HIS PURSUER WORKED HIS SINUOUS WAY ON HIS FOOTSTEPS
1806-143948-0015 WITH SUCH PERSEVERING HARDIHOOD THE INDUSTRY AND MOVEMENTS OF THE RIDER WERE NOT LESS REMARKABLE THAN THOSE OF THE RIDDEN AT EACH CHANGE IN THE EVOLUTIONS OF THE LATTER THE FORMER RAISED HIS TALL PERSON IN THE STIRRUPS PRODUCING IN THIS MANNER
1806-143948-0016 ONE SIDE OF THE MARE APPEARED TO JOURNEY FASTER THAN THE OTHER AND THAT THE AGGRIEVED FLANK WAS RESOLUTELY INDICATED BY UNREMITTED FLOURISHES OF A BUSHY TAIL WE FINISH THE PICTURE OF BOTH HORSE AND MAN
1806-143948-0017 AND EVEN THE DARK THOUGHTFUL EYE OF CORA
1806-143948-0018 OF ITS MISTRESS REPRESSED SEEK YOU ANY HERE
1806-143948-0019 GOOD COMPANY WOULD SEEM CONSISTENT TO THE WISHES OF BOTH PARTIES YOU APPEAR TO POSSESS THE PRIVILEGE OF A CASTING VOTE RETURNED HEYWARD WE ARE THREE WHILE YOU HAVE CONSULTED NO ONE BUT YOURSELF EVEN SO THE FIRST POINT TO BE OBTAINED
1806-143948-0020 IS TO KNOW ONE'S OWN MIND ONCE SURE OF THAT AND WHERE WOMEN ARE CONCERNED IT IS NOT EASY THE NEXT IS TO ACT UP TO THE DECISION I HAVE ENDEAVORED TO DO BOTH AND HERE I AM
1806-143948-0021 PROHIBITED A MORE OPEN EXPRESSION OF HIS ADMIRATION OF A WITTICISM THAT WAS PERFECTLY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO HIS HEARERS HE CONTINUED IT IS NOT PRUDENT FOR ANY ONE OF MY PROFESSION TO BE TOO FAMILIAR WITH THOSE HE HAS TO INSTRUCT
1806-143948-0022 FOR WHICH REASON I FOLLOW NOT THE LINE OF THE ARMY BESIDES WHICH I CONCLUDE THAT A GENTLEMAN OF YOUR CHARACTER HAS THE BEST JUDGMENT IN MATTERS OF WAYFARING I HAVE THEREFORE DECIDED TO JOIN COMPANY
1806-143948-0023 BUT YOU SPEAK OF INSTRUCTION AND OF A PROFESSION ARE YOU AN ADJUNCT TO THE PROVINCIAL CORPS AS A MASTER OF THE NOBLE SCIENCE OF DEFENSE AND OFFENSE OR PERHAPS
1806-143948-0024 UNDER THE PRETENSE OF EXPOUNDING THE MATHEMATICS
1806-143948-0025 HAVING COMMITTED NO PALPABLE SIN SINCE LAST ENTREATING HIS PARDONING GRACE I UNDERSTAND NOT YOUR ALLUSIONS ABOUT LINES AND ANGLES
1806-143948-0026 CRIED THE AMUSED ALICE AND I TAKE HIM UNDER MY OWN ESPECIAL PROTECTION NAY THROW ASIDE THAT FROWN HEYWARD AND IN PITY TO MY LONGING EARS SUFFER HIM TO JOURNEY IN OUR TRAIN BESIDES SHE ADDED IN A LOW AND HURRIED VOICE
1806-143948-0027 CASTING A GLANCE AT THE DISTANT CORA
1806-143948-0028 THEN YIELDING TO HER GENTLE INFLUENCE HE CLAPPED HIS SPURS
1806-143948-0029 MIGHT FILL THE LATTER IF ONE MAY JUDGE FROM THE INTONATIONS OF HIS VOICE IN COMMON DIALOGUE JUDGE NOT TOO RASHLY FROM HASTY AND DECEPTIVE APPEARANCES SAID THE LADY SMILING THOUGH MAJOR HEYWARD CAN ASSUME SUCH DEEP NOTES ON OCCASION
1806-143948-0030 BELIEVE ME HIS NATURAL TONES ARE BETTER FITTED FOR A MELLOW TENOR THAN THE BASS YOU HEARD IS HE THEN MUCH PRACTICED IN THE ART OF PSALMODY DEMANDED HER SIMPLE COMPANION ALICE FELT DISPOSED TO LAUGH
1806-143948-0031 THOUGH SHE SUCCEEDED IN SUPPRESSING HER MERRIMENT ERE SHE ANSWERED I APPREHEND THAT HE IS RATHER ADDICTED TO PROFANE SONG THE CHANCES OF A SOLDIER'S LIFE ARE BUT LITTLE FITTED FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF MORE SOBER INCLINATIONS
1806-143948-0032 MAN'S VOICE IS GIVEN TO HIM LIKE HIS OTHER TALENTS TO BE USED AND NOT TO BE ABUSED
1806-143948-0033 YOU HAVE THEN LIMITED YOUR EFFORTS TO SACRED SONG EVEN SO AS THE PSALMS OF DAVID EXCEED ALL OTHER LANGUAGE SO DOES THE PSALMODY THAT HAS BEEN FITTED TO THEM BY THE DIVINES
1806-143948-0034 AND SAGES OF THE LAND SURPASS ALL VAIN POETRY HAPPILY
1806-143948-0035 FOR THOUGH THE TIMES MAY CALL FOR SOME SLIGHT CHANGES YET DOES THIS VERSION WHICH WE USE IN THE COLONIES OF NEW ENGLAND SO MUCH EXCEED ALL OTHER VERSIONS THAT BY ITS RICHNESS ITS EXACTNESS AND ITS SPIRITUAL SIMPLICITY IT APPROACHETH AS NEAR
1806-143948-0036 I NEVER ABIDE IN ANY PLACE SLEEPING OR WAKING WITHOUT AN EXAMPLE OF THIS GIFTED WORK TIS THE SIX AND TWENTIETH EDITION PROMULGATED AT BOSTON
1806-143948-0037 SEVENTEEN FORTY FOUR AND IS ENTITLED THE PSALMS HYMNS AND SPIRITUAL SONGS OF THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS FAITHFULLY TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH METRE FOR THE USE EDIFICATION AND COMFORT OF THE SAINTS
1806-143948-0038 IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ESPECIALLY IN NEW ENGLAND
1806-143948-0039 FIRST PRONOUNCED THE WORD STANDISH AND PLACING THE UNKNOWN ENGINE ALREADY DESCRIBED TO HIS MOUTH FROM WHICH HE DREW A HIGH SHRILL SOUND THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY AN OCTAVE BELOW FROM HIS OWN VOICE
1806-143948-0040 TOGETHER E E N IN UNITY FOR BRETHREN SO TO DWELL IT'S LIKE THE CHOICE OINTMENT FROM THE HEAD TO THE BEARD DID GO DOWN AARON'S HEAD THAT DOWNWARD WENT HIS GARMENT'S SKIRTS UNTO
1806-143948-0041 THE DELIVERY OF THESE SKILLFUL RHYMES WAS ACCOMPANIED ON THE PART OF THE STRANGER BY A REGULAR RISE AND FALL OF HIS RIGHT HAND WHICH TERMINATED AT THE DESCENT BY SUFFERING THE FINGERS TO DWELL A MOMENT ON THE LEAVES OF THE LITTLE VOLUME
1806-143948-0042 IT WOULD SEEM LONG PRACTICE HAD RENDERED THIS MANUAL ACCOMPANIMENT NECESSARY
1806-143948-0043 HAD BEEN DULY DELIVERED LIKE A WORD OF TWO SYLLABLES SUCH AN INNOVATION ON THE SILENCE AND RETIREMENT OF THE FOREST COULD NOT FAIL TO ENLIST THE EARS OF THOSE WHO JOURNEYED AT SO SHORT A DISTANCE IN ADVANCE THE INDIAN MUTTERED
1806-143948-0044 A FEW WORDS IN BROKEN ENGLISH TO HEYWARD WHO IN HIS TURN SPOKE TO THE STRANGER AT ONCE INTERRUPTING AND FOR THE TIME CLOSING HIS MUSICAL EFFORTS THOUGH WE ARE NOT IN DANGER COMMON PRUDENCE WOULD TEACH US TO JOURNEY THROUGH THIS WILDERNESS
1806-143948-0045 RETURNED THE ARCH GIRL FOR NEVER DID I HEAR A MORE UNWORTHY CONJUNCTION OF EXECUTION AND LANGUAGE
1806-143948-0046 AND I WAS FAR GONE IN A LEARNED INQUIRY INTO THE CAUSES OF SUCH AN UNFITNESS BETWEEN SOUND AND SENSE WHEN YOU BROKE THE CHARM OF MY MUSINGS BY THAT BASS OF YOURS DUNCAN I KNOW NOT WHAT YOU CALL MY BASS SAID HEYWARD
1806-143948-0047 PIQUED AT HER REMARK BUT I KNOW THAT YOUR SAFETY AND THAT OF CORA IS FAR DEARER TO ME THAN COULD BE ANY ORCHESTRA OF HANDEL'S MUSIC HE PAUSED AND TURNED HIS HEAD QUICKLY TOWARD A THICKET AND THEN BENT HIS EYES SUSPICIOUSLY ON THEIR GUIDE
1806-143948-0048 WHO CONTINUED HIS STEADY PACE IN UNDISTURBED GRAVITY THE YOUNG MAN SMILED TO HIMSELF FOR HE BELIEVED HE HAD MISTAKEN SOME SHINING BERRY OF THE WOODS FOR THE GLISTENING EYEBALLS OF A PROWLING SAVAGE AND HE RODE FORWARD CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION
1806-143948-0049 WHICH HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED BY THE PASSING THOUGHT MAJOR HEYWARD WAS MISTAKEN ONLY IN SUFFERING HIS YOUTHFUL AND GENEROUS PRIDE TO SUPPRESS HIS ACTIVE WATCHFULNESS THE CAVALCADE HAD NOT LONG PASSED
1806-143948-0050 BEFORE THE BRANCHES OF THE BUSHES THAT FORMED THE THICKET WERE CAUTIOUSLY MOVED ASUNDER AND A HUMAN VISAGE
