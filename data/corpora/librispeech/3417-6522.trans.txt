3417-6522-0000 BUT AT SIX ICE WAS SIGHTED AHEAD UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS THE SAFE COURSE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO GO ABOUT AND STAND TO THE EAST BUT IN OUR CASE WE MUST RISK TROUBLE TO GET SMOOTHER WATER FOR THE PONIES
3417-6522-0001 WE PASSED A STREAM OF ICE OVER WHICH THE SEA WAS BREAKING HEAVILY AND ONE REALISED THE DANGER OF BEING AMONGST LOOSE FLOES IN SUCH A SEA BUT SOON WE CAME TO A COMPACTER BODY OF FLOES AND RUNNING BEHIND THIS
3417-6522-0002 WE WERE AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO FIND COMPARATIVELY SMOOTH WATER WE RAN ON FOR A BIT THEN STOPPED AND LAY TO NOW WE ARE LYING IN A SORT OF ICE BAY THERE IS A MILE OR SO OF PACK TO WINDWARD
3417-6522-0003 AND TWO HORNS WHICH FORM THE BAY EMBRACING US THE SEA IS DAMPED DOWN TO A GENTLE SWELL ALTHOUGH THE WIND IS AS STRONG AS EVER AS A RESULT WE ARE LYING VERY COMFORTABLY THE ICE IS DRIFTING A LITTLE FASTER THAN THE SHIP
3417-6522-0004 SO THAT WE HAVE OCCASIONALLY TO STEAM SLOWLY TO LEEWARD SO FAR SO GOOD FROM A DANGEROUS POSITION WE HAVE ACHIEVED ONE WHICH ONLY DIRECTLY INVOLVED A WASTE OF COAL THE QUESTION IS WHICH WILL LAST LONGEST
3417-6522-0005 THE GALE OR OUR TEMPORARY SHELTER RENNICK HAS JUST OBTAINED A SOUNDING OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN FATHOMS TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH YESTERDAY'S
3417-6522-0006 AND ROSS'S SOUNDING OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THIS IS INTERESTING SHOWING THE RAPID GRADIENT OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF NELSON IS GOING TO PUT OVER THE EIGHT FEET AGASSIZ TRAWL
3417-6522-0007 A LIGHT DREDGE WAS TRIED ON A SMALL MANILLA LINE VERY LITTLE RESULT
3417-6522-0008 A SECOND TIME WITH MORE WEIGHT AND LINE
3417-6522-0009 EVENING OUR PROTECTION GREW LESS AS THE DAY ADVANCED BUT SAVED US MUCH FROM THE HEAVY SWELL AT EIGHT P M WE STARTED TO STEAM WEST TO GAIN FRESH PROTECTION THERE BEING SIGNS OF PACK TO SOUTH AND WEST
3417-6522-0010 NOW THE SQUALLS ARE LESSENING IN FORCE THE SKY IS CLEARING AND WE SEEM TO BE APPROACHING THE END OF THE BLOW I TRUST IT MAY BE SO AND THAT THE NEW YEAR WILL BRING US BETTER FORTUNE THAN THE OLD
3417-6522-0011 LAND OH AT TEN P M TO NIGHT AS THE CLOUDS LIFTED TO THE WEST A DISTANT BUT SPLENDID VIEW OF THE GREAT MOUNTAINS WAS OBTAINED ALL WERE IN SUNSHINE SABINE AND WHEWELL
3417-6522-0012 AS REMARKABLE A LANDMARK AS SABINE ITSELF MOUNT SABINE WAS ONE HUNDRED TEN MILES AWAY WHEN WE SAW IT
3417-6522-0013 IT IS ABSOLUTELY CALM WITH GLORIOUS BRIGHT SUNSHINE SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE SUNNING THEMSELVES AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK SITTING ON DECK AND READING THE LAND IS CLEAR TO NIGHT COULMAN ISLAND SEVENTY FIVE MILES WEST
3417-6522-0014 THE SUN HAS BEEN SHINING ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY
3417-6522-0015 BUT BOWERS HAS KEPT GOING IN ALL WEATHERS THERE IS STILL A GOOD DEAL OF SWELL DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND AFTER A DAY'S CALM AND LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED MILES OF WATER TO WIND WARD
3417-6522-0016 WILSON SAW AND SKETCHED THE NEW WHITE STOMACHED WHALE SEEN BY US IN THE PACK
3417-6522-0017 THE SKY IS COVERED WITH LIGHT CUMULUS AND AN EASTERLY WIND HAS SPRUNG UP FORCE TWO TO THREE WITH ALL SAIL SET WE ARE MAKING VERY GOOD PROGRESS
3417-6522-0018 TEN A M THE CONDITIONS ARE VERY MUCH THE SAME AS LAST NIGHT
3417-6522-0019 AND THE LAND IS SHOWING UP WELL THOUGH EREBUS IS VEILED IN STRATUS CLOUD
3417-6522-0020 BUT THE WIND IS ALARMING AND THERE IS A SLIGHT SWELL WHICH HAS LITTLE EFFECT ON THE SHIP BUT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE TO OUR LANDING FOR THE MOMENT IT DOESN'T LOOK HOPEFUL WE HAVE BEEN CONTINUING OUR LINE OF SOUNDINGS
3417-6522-0021 THE WATER HAS GRADUALLY GOT DEEPER AND WE ARE NOW GETTING THREE HUNDRED TEN TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FATHOMS AGAINST ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY ON THE BANK THE DISCOVERY SOUNDINGS GIVE DEPTHS UP TO FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FATHOMS
3417-6522-0022 EAST OF ROSS ISLAND SIX P M NO GOOD ALAS CAPE CROZIER WITH ALL ITS ATTRACTIONS IS DENIED US WE CAME UP TO THE BARRIER FIVE MILES EAST OF THE CAPE SOON AFTER ONE P M
3417-6522-0023 BARRIER WAS NOT MORE THAN SIXTY FEET IN HEIGHT FROM THE CROW'S NEST ONE COULD SEE WELL OVER IT AND NOTED THAT THERE WAS A GENTLE SLOPE FOR AT LEAST A MILE TOWARDS THE EDGE THE LAND OF BLACK OR WHITE ISLAND
3417-6522-0024 COULD BE SEEN DISTINCTLY BEHIND TOPPING THE HUGE LINES OF PRESSURE RIDGES WE PLOTTED THE BARRIER EDGE FROM THE POINT AT WHICH WE MET IT TO THE CROZIER CLIFFS TO THE EYE IT SEEMS SCARCELY TO HAVE CHANGED SINCE DISCOVERY DAYS
3417-6522-0025 AND WILSON THINKS IT MEETS THE CLIFF IN THE SAME PLACE THE BARRIER TAKES A SHARP TURN BACK AT TWO OR THREE MILES FROM THE CLIFFS RUNS BACK FOR HALF A MILE THEN WEST AGAIN WITH A FAIRLY REGULAR SURFACE
3417-6522-0026 UNTIL WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF THE CLIFFS THE INTERVAL IS OCCUPIED WITH A SINGLE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE THE EVIDENCES OF PRESSURE AT THE EDGE BEING LESS MARKED THAN I HAD EXPECTED
3417-6522-0027 PONTING WAS VERY BUSY WITH CINEMATOGRAPH AND CAMERA IN THE ANGLE AT THE CORNER NEAR THE CLIFFS RENNICK GOT A SOUNDING OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY FATHOMS AND NELSON SOME TEMPERATURES AND SAMPLES
3417-6522-0028 WHEN LOWERING THE WATER BOTTLE ON ONE OCCASION THE LINE SUDDENLY BECAME SLACK AT ONE HUNDRED METRES THEN AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE BEGAN TO RUN OUT AGAIN WE ARE CURIOUS TO KNOW THE CAUSE
3417-6522-0029 MEANWHILE ONE OF THE WHALE BOATS WAS LOWERED AND WILSON GRIFFITH TAYLOR PRIESTLEY EVANS AND I WERE PULLED TOWARDS THE SHORE THE AFTER GUARD ARE SO KEEN THAT THE PROPER BOAT'S CREW WAS DISPLACED AND THE OARS MANNED BY OATES ATKINSON AND CHERRY GARRARD
3417-6522-0030 THE LATTER CATCHING SEVERAL CRABS THE SWELL MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO LAND I HAD HOPED TO SEE WHETHER THERE WAS ROOM TO PASS BETWEEN THE PRESSURE RIDGE AND THE CLIFF A ROUTE BY WHICH ROYDS ONCE DESCENDED TO THE EMPEROR ROOKERY
3417-6522-0031 AS WE APPROACHED THE CORNER WE SAW THAT A LARGE PIECE OF SEA FLOE ICE HAD BEEN JAMMED BETWEEN THE BARRIER AND THE CLIFF AND HAD BUCKLED UP
3417-6522-0032 THIS IS AN AGE AND STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE EMPEROR CHICK OF WHICH WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A TRIUMPH TO HAVE SECURED THE CHICK BUT ALAS THERE WAS NO WAY TO GET AT IT ANOTHER MOST CURIOUS SIGHT
3417-6522-0033 WAS THE FEET AND TAILS OF TWO CHICKS AND THE FLIPPER OF AN ADULT BIRD PROJECTING FROM THE ICE ON THE UNDER SIDE OF THE JAMMED FLOE
3417-6522-0034 FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO LAND OWING TO THE SWELL WE PULLED ALONG THE CLIFFS FOR A SHORT WAY THESE CROZIER CLIFFS ARE REMARKABLY INTERESTING THE ROCK MAINLY VOLCANIC TUFF
3417-6522-0035 INCLUDES THICK STRATA OF COLUMNAR BASALT AND ONE COULD SEE BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS OF JAMMED AND TWISTED COLUMNS AS WELL AS CAVES WITH WHOLE AND HALF PILLARS VERY MUCH LIKE A MINIATURE GIANT'S CAUSEWAY
3417-6522-0036 BANDS OF BRIGHT YELLOW OCCURRED IN THE RICH BROWN OF THE CLIFFS CAUSED THE GEOLOGISTS THINK BY THE ACTION OF SALTS ON THE BROWN ROCK IN PLACES THE CLIFFS OVERHUNG
3417-6522-0037 AND CONTINUED TO BREAK INTO THEM OVER A SHELVING BEACH ICICLES HUNG PENDANT EVERYWHERE
3417-6522-0038 WE NOTICED A VERY CLEAR ECHO AS WE PASSED CLOSE TO A PERPENDICULAR ROCK FACE LATER WE RETURNED TO THE SHIP WHICH HAD BEEN TRYING TO TURN IN THE BAY SHE IS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY IN THIS RESPECT
3417-6522-0039 SEVERAL MINUTES OFTEN ELAPSE AFTER THE TELEGRAPH HAS BEEN PUT OVER BEFORE THERE IS ANY MOVEMENT OF THE ENGINES IT MAKES THE POSITION RATHER ALARMING WHEN ONE IS FEELING ONE'S WAY INTO SOME DOUBTFUL CORNER
3417-6522-0040 WHEN THE WHALER WAS HOISTED WE PROCEEDED ROUND TO THE PENGUIN ROOKERY HOPES OF FINDING A QUIET LANDING HAD NOW ALMOST DISAPPEARED
3417-6522-0041 GOING CLOSE TO THESE WE GOT REPEATED SOUNDINGS VARYING FROM THIRTY FOUR DOWN TO TWELVE FATHOMS THERE IS EVIDENTLY A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE BANK AT THE FOOT OF THE ROOKERY
3417-6522-0042 RELUCTANTLY AND SADLY WE HAVE HAD TO ABANDON OUR CHERISHED PLAN IT IS A THOUSAND PITIES
3417-6522-0043 COMFORTABLE QUARTERS FOR THE HUT ICE FOR WATER SNOW FOR THE ANIMALS GOOD SLOPES FOR SKI ING VAST TRACKS OF ROCK FOR WALKS PROXIMITY TO THE BARRIER AND TO THE ROOKERIES OF TWO TYPES OF PENGUINS EASY ASCENT OF MOUNT TERROR
3417-6522-0044 GOOD GROUND FOR BIOLOGICAL WORK GOOD PEAKS FOR OBSERVATION OF ALL SORTS FAIRLY EASY APPROACH TO THE SOUTHERN ROAD WITH NO CHANCE OF BEING CUT OFF AND SO FORTH IT IS A THOUSAND PITIES
3417-6522-0045 TO HAVE TO ABANDON SUCH A SPOT ON PASSING THE ROOKERY IT SEEMED TO ME WE HAD BEEN WRONG IN ASSUMING THAT ALL THE GUANO IS BLOWN AWAY I THINK THERE MUST BE A PRETTY GOOD DEPOSIT IN PLACES
3417-6522-0046 THE PENGUINS COULD BE SEEN VERY CLEARLY FROM THE SHIP ON THE LARGE ROOKERY THEY OCCUPY AN IMMENSE ACREAGE
3417-6522-0047 BUT ON THE SMALL ROOKERY THEY ARE PATCHY
3417-6522-0048 SUCH UNUSED SPACES WOULD HAVE BEEN IDEAL FOR A WINTERING STATION IF ONLY SOME EASY WAY COULD HAVE BEEN FOUND TO LAND STORES I NOTED MANY GROUPS OF PENGUINS ON THE SNOW SLOPES OVER LOOKING THE SEA FAR FROM THE ROOKERIES
3417-6522-0049 AND ONE FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY MEANDER AWAY TO SUCH PLACES A NUMBER OF KILLER WHALES ROSE CLOSE TO THE SHIP WHEN WE WERE OPPOSITE THE ROOKERY WHAT AN EXCELLENT TIME THESE ANIMALS MUST HAVE
3417-6522-0050 WITH THOUSANDS OF PENGUINS PASSING TO AND FRO WE SAW OUR OLD DISCOVERY POST OFFICE POLE
3417-6522-0051 IN THE CASE OF THE BARRIER EDGE FROM THE PENGUIN ROOKERIES TO THE WEST IT IS A RELENTLESS COAST WITH HIGH ICE CLIFFS AND OCCASIONAL BARE PATCHES OF ROCK SHOWING THROUGH EVEN IF LANDING WERE POSSIBLE
3417-6522-0052 THE GRIMMEST CREVASSED SNOW SLOPES LIE BEHIND TO CUT ONE OFF FROM THE BARRIER SURFACE THERE IS NO HOPE OF SHELTER TILL WE REACH CAPE ROYDS MEANWHILE ALL HANDS ARE EMPLOYED MAKING A RUNNING SURVEY
3417-6522-0053 I GIVE AN IDEA OF THE PROGRAMME OPPOSITE TERROR CLEARED ITSELF OF CLOUD SOME HOURS AGO AND WE HAVE HAD SOME CHANGE IN VIEWS OF IT IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE ASCENT WOULD BE EASY
3417-6522-0054 THE BAY ON THE NORTH SIDE OF EREBUS IS MUCH DEEPER THAN SHOWN ON THE CHART THE SUN HAS BEEN OBSTINATE ALL DAY PEEPING OUT OCCASIONALLY
3417-6522-0055 PROGRAMME BRUCE CONTINUALLY CHECKING SPEED WITH HAND LOG BOWERS TAKING ALTITUDES OF OBJECTS AS THEY COME ABEAM
3417-6522-0056 NELSON NOTING RESULTS PENNELL TAKING VERGE PLATE BEARINGS ON BOW AND QUARTER CHERRY GARRARD NOTING RESULTS EVANS TAKING VERGE PLATE BEARINGS ABEAM ATKINSON NOTING RESULTS
3417-6522-0057 CAMPBELL TAKING DISTANCES ABEAM WITH RANGE FINDER WRIGHT NOTING RESULTS RENNICK SOUNDING WITH THOMSON MACHINE DRAKE NOTING RESULTS
3417-6522-0058 BEAUFORT ISLAND LOOKS VERY BLACK FROM THE SOUTH
3417-6522-0059 WE FIND PACK OFF CAPE BIRD WE HAVE PASSED THROUGH SOME STREAMS AND THERE IS SOME OPEN WATER AHEAD BUT I'M AFRAID WE MAY FIND THE ICE PRETTY THICK IN THE STRAIT AT THIS DATE WEDNESDAY JANUARY FOUR ONE A M
3417-6522-0060 WE ARE AROUND CAPE BIRD AND IN SIGHT OF OUR DESTINATION BUT IT IS DOUBTFUL IF THE OPEN WATER EXTENDS SO FAR WE HAVE ADVANCED BY FOLLOWING AN OPEN WATER LEAD CLOSE ALONG THE LAND
3417-6522-0061 CAPE BIRD IS A VERY ROUNDED PROMONTORY WITH MANY HEADLANDS IT IS NOT EASY TO SAY WHICH OF THESE IS THE CAPE
3417-6522-0062 THERE IS A VERY EXTENSIVE EXPANSE OF LAND AND ON IT ONE LARGER AND SEVERAL SMALL PENGUIN ROOKERIES ON THE UNIFORM DARK REDDISH BROWN OF THE LAND CAN BE SEEN NUMEROUS GREY SPOTS THESE ARE ERRATIC BOULDERS OF GRANITE
3417-6522-0063 THROUGH GLASSES ONE COULD BE SEEN PERCHED ON A PEAK AT LEAST THIRTEEN HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE SEA ANOTHER GROUP OF KILLER WHALES WERE IDLY DIVING OFF THE PENGUIN ROOKERY AN OLD ONE WITH A VERY HIGH STRAIGHT DORSAL FIN AND SEVERAL YOUNGSTERS
3417-6522-0064 IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE FAILED TO SEE THE SINISTER FINS DURING THEIR FREQUENT JUMPS INTO THE AIR
3417-6522-0065 CROSSED THE WHALES YET THERE WAS NO COMMOTION WHATEVER AND PRESENTLY THE SMALL BIRDS COULD BE SEEN LEAPING AWAY ON THE OTHER SIDE ONE CAN ONLY SUPPOSE THE WHALES ARE SATIATED AS WE ROUNDED CAPE BIRD
3417-6522-0066 WE CAME IN SIGHT OF THE OLD WELL REMEMBERED LAND MARKS MOUNT DISCOVERY AND THE WESTERN MOUNTAINS SEEN DIMLY THROUGH A HAZY ATMOSPHERE IT WAS GOOD TO SEE THEM AGAIN AND PERHAPS AFTER ALL
3417-6522-0067 WE ARE BETTER THIS SIDE OF THE ISLAND IT GIVES ONE A HOMELY FEELING TO SEE SUCH A FAMILIAR SCENE FOUR A M THE STEEP EXPOSED HILL SIDES ON THE WEST SIDE OF CAPE BIRD LOOK LIKE HIGH CLIFFS AS ONE GETS SOUTH OF THEM
3417-6522-0068 THE FLOES HEAVIER BUT THE LATTER REMAIN LOOSE MANY OF US SPENT THE NIGHT ON DECK AS WE PUSHED THROUGH THE PACK WE HAVE PASSED SOME VERY LARGE FLOES EVIDENTLY FROZEN IN THE STRAIT THIS IS CURIOUS
3417-6522-0069 EARLY IN THE SPRING I HAVE OBSERVED SEVERAL FLOES WITH AN ENTIRELY NEW TYPE OF SURFACE THEY ARE COVERED WITH SCALES EACH SCALE CONSISTING OF A NUMBER OF LITTLE FLAKY ICE SHEETS
3417-6522-0070 SUPERIMPOSED AND ALL DIPPING AT THE SAME ANGLE IT SUGGESTS TO ME A SURFACE WITH SASTRUGI
3417-6522-0071 WE ARE WITHIN FIVE MILES OF CAPE ROYDS AND OUGHT TO GET THERE WEDNESDAY JANUARY FOUR P M THIS WORK IS FULL OF SURPRISES AT SIX A M
3417-6522-0072 WE STEERED FOR THE CAPE FULLY EXPECTING TO FIND THE EDGE OF THE PACK ICE RANGING WESTWARD FROM IT TO OUR ASTONISHMENT WE RAN ON PAST THE CAPE WITH CLEAR WATER OR THIN SLUDGE ICE ON ALL SIDES OF US PAST CAPE ROYDS
3417-6522-0073 PAST CAPE BARNE PAST THE GLACIER ON ITS SOUTH SIDE AND FINALLY ROUND AND PAST INACCESSIBLE ISLAND A GOOD TWO MILES SOUTH OF CAPE ROYDS THE CAPE ITSELF WAS CUT OFF FROM THE SOUTH WE COULD HAVE GONE FARTHER
3417-6522-0074 BUT THE LAST SLUDGE ICE SEEMED TO BE INCREASING IN THICKNESS
3417-6522-0075 OR THE LAND SO FREE FROM SNOW TAKING THESE FACTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE EXCEPTIONAL WARMTH OF THE AIR I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT HAD BEEN AN EXCEPTIONALLY WARM SUMMER AT THIS POINT
3417-6522-0076 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE HAD A CONSIDERABLE CHOICE OF WINTERING SPOTS WE COULD HAVE GONE TO EITHER OF THE SMALL ISLANDS TO THE MAINLAND
3417-6522-0077 OR PRETTY WELL ANYWHERE EXCEPT HUT POINT MY MAIN WISH WAS TO CHOOSE A PLACE THAT WOULD NOT BE EASILY CUT OFF FROM THE BARRIER AND MY EYE FELL ON A CAPE WHICH WE USED TO CALL THE SKUARY A LITTLE BEHIND US
3417-6522-0078 IT WAS SEPARATED FROM OLD DISCOVERY QUARTERS
3417-6522-0079 THE ICE WOULD SOON BECOME FIRM I CALLED A COUNCIL AND PUT THESE PROPOSITIONS TO PUSH ON TO THE GLACIER TONGUE AND WINTER THERE TO PUSH WEST TO THE TOMBSTONE ICE
3417-6522-0080 I FAVOURED THE LATTER COURSE
3417-6522-0081 SO WE TURNED BACK CLOSE AROUND INACCESSIBLE ISLAND AND STEERED FOR THE FAST ICE OFF THE CAPE AT FULL SPEED AFTER PIERCING A SMALL FRINGE OF THIN ICE AT THE EDGE OF THE FAST FLOE
3417-6522-0082 THE SHIP'S STEM STRUCK HEAVILY ON HARD BAY ICE ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF FROM THE SHORE HERE WAS A ROAD TO THE CAPE AND A SOLID WHARF ON WHICH TO LAND OUR STORES WE MADE FAST WITH ICE ANCHORS
3417-6522-0083 WILSON EVANS AND I WENT TO THE CAPE WHICH I HAD NOW RECHRISTENED CAPE EVANS IN HONOUR OF OUR EXCELLENT SECOND IN COMMAND A GLANCE AT THE LAND SHOWED AS WE EXPECTED IDEAL SPOTS FOR OUR WINTERING STATION
3417-6522-0084 THE ROCK OF THE CAPE CONSISTS MAINLY OF VOLCANIC AGGLOMERATE WITH OLIVINE KENYTE IT IS MUCH WEATHERED AND THE DESTRUCTION HAD FORMED QUANTITIES OF COARSE SAND WE CHOSE A SPOT FOR THE HUT
3417-6522-0085 WHICH I MUST DETAIL LATER FOR A WINTER STATION AND WE REALISED THAT AT LENGTH OUR LUCK HAD TURNED THE MOST FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCE OF ALL IS THE STRONGE CHANCE OF COMMUNICATION WITH CAPE ARMITAGE BEING ESTABLISHED AT AN EARLY DATE
3417-6522-0086 DOES NOT BECOME SECURE TILL LATE IN THE SEASON PROBABLY IN MAY BEFORE THAT ALL EVIDENCE SEEMS TO SHOW THAT THE PART BETWEEN CAPE ROYDS AND CAPE BARNE IS CONTINUALLY GOING OUT HOW I ASK MYSELF
3417-6522-0087 AT A COMPARATIVELY EARLY DATE IT WILL PROBABLY ONLY BE NECESSARY TO CROSS THE SEA ICE
3417-6522-0088 EVEN IF IT SHOULD BOTH STAGES CAN BE SEEN BEFORE THE PARTY VENTURES UPON THEM AFTER MANY FROWNS FORTUNE HAS TREATED US TO THE KINDEST SMILE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE HAVE HAD A CALM
3417-6522-0089 WITH BRILLIANT SUNSHINE SUCH WEATHER IN SUCH A PLACE
3417-6522-0090 THAT I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED THE WARM GLOW OF THE SUN WITH THE KEEN INVIGORATING COLD OF THE AIR FORMS A COMBINATION WHICH IS INEXPRESSIBLY HEALTH GIVING AND SATISFYING TO ME WHILST THE GOLDEN LIGHT
3417-6522-0091 ON THIS WONDERFUL SCENE OF MOUNTAIN AND ICE SATISFIES EVERY CLAIM OF SCENIC MAGNIFICENCE NO WORDS OF MINE CAN CONVEY THE IMPRESSIVENESS OF THE WONDERFUL PANORAMA DISPLAYED TO OUR EYES
3417-6522-0092 PONTING IS ENRAPTURED AND USES EXPRESSIONS WHICH IN ANYONE ELSE
