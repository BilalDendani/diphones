1870-148296-0000 A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM HERMIA AND LYSANDER WERE LOVERS BUT HERMIA'S FATHER WISHED HER TO MARRY ANOTHER MAN NAMED DEMETRIUS NOW IN ATHENS WHERE THEY LIVED THERE WAS A WICKED LAW
1870-148296-0001 BY WHICH ANY GIRL WHO REFUSED TO MARRY ACCORDING TO HER FATHER'S WISHES MIGHT BE PUT TO DEATH HERMIA'S FATHER WAS SO ANGRY WITH HER FOR REFUSING TO DO AS HE WISHED THAT HE ACTUALLY BROUGHT HER BEFORE THE DUKE OF ATHENS
1870-148296-0002 TO ASK THAT SHE MIGHT BE KILLED IF SHE STILL REFUSED TO OBEY HIM THE DUKE GAVE HER FOUR DAYS TO THINK ABOUT IT AND AT THE END OF THAT TIME IF SHE STILL REFUSED TO MARRY DEMETRIUS SHE WOULD HAVE TO DIE
1870-148296-0003 LYSANDER OF COURSE WAS NEARLY MAD WITH GRIEF AND THE BEST THING TO DO SEEMED TO HIM FOR HERMIA TO RUN AWAY TO HIS AUNT'S HOUSE AT A PLACE BEYOND THE REACH OF THAT CRUEL LAW AND THERE HE WOULD COME TO HER AND MARRY HER
1870-148296-0004 BUT BEFORE SHE STARTED SHE TOLD HER FRIEND HELENA WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO DO HELENA HAD BEEN DEMETRIUS SWEETHEART LONG BEFORE HIS MARRIAGE WITH HERMIA HAD BEEN THOUGHT OF AND BEING VERY SILLY LIKE ALL JEALOUS PEOPLE
1870-148296-0005 SHE COULD NOT SEE THAT IT WAS NOT POOR HERMIA'S FAULT THAT DEMETRIUS WISHED TO MARRY HER INSTEAD OF HIS OWN LADY HELENA SHE KNEW THAT IF SHE TOLD DEMETRIUS THAT HERMIA WAS GOING AS SHE WAS TO THE WOOD OUTSIDE ATHENS HE WOULD FOLLOW HER
1870-148296-0006 AND I CAN FOLLOW HIM AND AT LEAST I SHALL SEE HIM SHE SAID TO HERSELF SO SHE WENT TO HIM AND BETRAYED HER FRIEND'S SECRET NOW THIS WOOD WHERE LYSANDER WAS TO MEET HERMIA
1870-148296-0007 AND WHERE THE OTHER TWO HAD DECIDED TO FOLLOW THEM WAS FULL OF FAIRIES AS MOST WOODS ARE IF ONE ONLY HAD THE EYES TO SEE THEM AND IN THIS WOOD ON THIS NIGHT WERE THE KING AND QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES OBERON AND TITANIA
1870-148296-0008 NOW FAIRIES ARE VERY WISE PEOPLE BUT NOW AND THEN THEY CAN BE QUITE AS FOOLISH AS MORTAL FOLK OBERON AND TITANIA WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN AS HAPPY AS THE DAYS WERE LONG HAD THROWN AWAY ALL THEIR JOY
1870-148296-0009 IN A FOOLISH QUARREL THEY NEVER MET WITHOUT SAYING DISAGREEABLE THINGS TO EACH OTHER AND SCOLDED EACH OTHER SO DREADFULLY THAT ALL THEIR LITTLE FAIRY FOLLOWERS FOR FEAR WOULD CREEP INTO ACORN CUPS
1870-148296-0010 AND HIDE THEM THERE SO INSTEAD OF KEEPING ONE HAPPY COURT AND DANCING ALL NIGHT THROUGH IN THE MOONLIGHT AS IS FAIRIES USE THE KING WITH HIS ATTENDANTS WANDERED THROUGH ONE PART OF THE WOOD WHILE THE QUEEN WITH HERS
1870-148296-0011 KEPT STATE IN ANOTHER AND THE CAUSE OF ALL THIS TROUBLE WAS A LITTLE INDIAN BOY WHOM TITANIA HAD TAKEN TO BE ONE OF HER FOLLOWERS OBERON WANTED THE CHILD TO FOLLOW HIM
1870-148296-0012 AND BE ONE OF HIS FAIRY KNIGHTS BUT THE QUEEN WOULD NOT GIVE HIM UP ON THIS NIGHT IN A MOSSY MOONLIT GLADE THE KING AND QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES MET
1870-148296-0013 SAID THE KING WHAT JEALOUS OBERON
1870-148296-0014 YOU SPOIL EVERYTHING WITH YOUR QUARRELING COME FAIRIES LET US LEAVE HIM I AM NOT FRIENDS WITH HIM NOW IT RESTS WITH YOU TO MAKE UP THE QUARREL SAID THE KING GIVE ME THAT LITTLE INDIAN BOY AND I WILL AGAIN BE YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT AND SUITOR
1870-148296-0015 SET YOUR MIND AT REST SAID THE QUEEN YOUR WHOLE FAIRY KINGDOM BUYS NOT THAT BOY FROM ME COME FAIRIES AND SHE AND HER TRAIN RODE OFF DOWN THE MOONBEAMS WELL GO YOUR WAYS
1870-148296-0016 SAID OBERON BUT I'LL BE EVEN WITH YOU BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS WOOD THEN OBERON CALLED HIS FAVORITE FAIRY PUCK PUCK WAS THE SPIRIT OF MISCHIEF HE USED TO SLIP INTO THE DAIRIES AND TAKE THE CREAM AWAY
1870-148296-0017 AND GET INTO THE CHURN SO THAT THE BUTTER WOULD NOT COME AND TURN THE BEER SOUR AND LEAD PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR WAY ON DARK NIGHTS AND THEN LAUGH AT THEM AND TUMBLE PEOPLE'S STOOLS FROM UNDER THEM WHEN THEY WERE GOING TO SIT DOWN AND UPSET THEIR HOT ALE OVER THEIR CHINS WHEN THEY WERE GOING TO DRINK
1870-148296-0018 NOW SAID OBERON TO THIS LITTLE SPRITE FETCH ME THE FLOWER CALLED LOVE IN IDLENESS THE JUICE OF THAT LITTLE PURPLE FLOWER LAID ON THE EYES OF THOSE WHO SLEEP WILL MAKE THEM
1870-148296-0019 WHEN THEY WAKE TO LOVE THE FIRST THING THEY SEE I WILL PUT SOME OF THE JUICE OF THAT FLOWER ON MY TITANIA'S EYES AND WHEN SHE WAKES SHE WILL LOVE THE FIRST THING SHE SEES WERE IT LION BEAR
1870-148296-0020 WHILE PUCK WAS GONE DEMETRIUS PASSED THROUGH THE GLADE FOLLOWED BY POOR HELENA AND STILL SHE TOLD HIM HOW SHE LOVED HIM AND REMINDED HIM OF ALL HIS PROMISES
1870-148296-0021 AND STILL HE TOLD HER THAT HE DID NOT AND COULD NOT LOVE HER AND THAT HIS PROMISES WERE NOTHING OBERON WAS SORRY FOR POOR HELENA AND WHEN PUCK RETURNED WITH THE FLOWER HE BADE HIM FOLLOW DEMETRIUS
1870-148296-0022 AND PUT SOME OF THE JUICE ON HIS EYES SO THAT HE MIGHT LOVE HELENA WHEN HE WOKE AND LOOKED ON HER AS MUCH AS SHE LOVED HIM SO PUCK SET OFF AND WANDERING THROUGH THE WOOD FOUND NOT DEMETRIUS BUT LYSANDER
1870-148296-0023 ON WHOSE EYES HE PUT THE JUICE BUT WHEN LYSANDER WOKE HE SAW NOT HIS OWN HERMIA BUT HELENA WHO WAS WALKING THROUGH THE WOOD LOOKING FOR THE CRUEL DEMETRIUS
1870-148296-0024 HE LOVED HER AND LEFT HIS OWN LADY UNDER THE SPELL OF THE PURPLE FLOWER WHEN HERMIA WOKE SHE FOUND LYSANDER GONE AND WANDERED ABOUT THE WOOD TRYING TO FIND HIM
1870-148296-0025 AND OBERON SOON FOUND THAT HE HAD MADE A MISTAKE AND SET ABOUT LOOKING FOR DEMETRIUS AND HAVING FOUND HIM PUT SOME OF THE JUICE ON HIS EYES AND THE FIRST THING DEMETRIUS SAW WHEN HE WOKE WAS ALSO HELENA
1870-148296-0026 SO NOW DEMETRIUS AND LYSANDER WERE BOTH FOLLOWING HER THROUGH THE WOOD AND IT WAS HERMIA'S TURN TO FOLLOW HER LOVER AS HELENA HAD DONE BEFORE
1870-148296-0027 THE END OF IT WAS THAT HELENA AND HERMIA BEGAN TO QUARREL AND DEMETRIUS AND LYSANDER WENT OFF TO FIGHT OBERON WAS VERY SORRY TO SEE HIS KIND SCHEME TO HELP THESE LOVERS TURN OUT SO BADLY SO HE SAID TO PUCK
1870-148296-0028 THESE TWO YOUNG MEN ARE GOING TO FIGHT YOU MUST OVERHANG THE NIGHT WITH DROOPING FOG AND LEAD THEM SO ASTRAY THAT ONE WILL NEVER FIND THE OTHER WHEN THEY ARE TIRED OUT THEY WILL FALL ASLEEP
1870-148296-0029 THEN DROP THIS OTHER HERB ON LYSANDER'S EYES THAT WILL GIVE HIM HIS OLD SIGHT AND HIS OLD LOVE THEN EACH MAN WILL HAVE THE LADY WHO LOVES HIM
1870-148296-0030 A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM THEN WHEN THIS IS DONE ALL WILL BE WELL WITH THEM SO PUCK WENT AND DID AS HE WAS TOLD AND WHEN THE TWO HAD FALLEN ASLEEP WITHOUT MEETING EACH OTHER
1870-148296-0031 PUCK POURED THE JUICE ON LYSANDER'S EYES AND SAID WHEN THOU WAKEST THOU TAKEST TRUE DELIGHT IN THE SIGHT OF THY FORMER LADY'S EYE JACK SHALL HAVE JILL NOUGHT SHALL GO ILL
1870-148296-0032 MUSK ROSES AND EGLANTINE THERE TITANIA ALWAYS SLEPT A PART OF THE NIGHT WRAPPED IN THE ENAMELED SKIN OF A SNAKE OBERON STOOPED OVER HER AND LAID THE JUICE ON HER EYES SAYING
1870-148296-0033 WHAT THOU SEEST WHEN THOU WAKE DO IT FOR THY TRUE LOVE TAKE NOW IT HAPPENED THAT WHEN TITANIA WOKE THE FIRST THING SHE SAW WAS A STUPID CLOWN
1870-148296-0034 ONE OF A PARTY OF PLAYERS WHO HAD COME OUT INTO THE WOOD TO REHEARSE THEIR PLAY THIS CLOWN HAD MET WITH PUCK WHO HAD CLAPPED AN ASS'S HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS SO THAT IT LOOKED AS IF IT GREW THERE
1870-148296-0035 DIRECTLY TITANIA WOKE AND SAW THIS DREADFUL MONSTER SHE SAID WHAT ANGEL IS THIS
1870-148296-0036 IF I AM WISE ENOUGH TO FIND MY WAY OUT OF THIS WOOD THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME SAID THE FOOLISH CLOWN DO NOT DESIRE TO GO OUT OF THE WOOD SAID TITANIA THE SPELL OF THE LOVE JUICE WAS ON HER AND TO HER
1870-148296-0037 THE CLOWN SEEMED THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND DELIGHTFUL CREATURE ON ALL THE EARTH I LOVE YOU SHE WENT ON COME WITH ME AND I WILL GIVE YOU FAIRIES TO ATTEND ON YOU SO SHE CALLED FOUR FAIRIES WHOSE NAMES WERE PEASEBLOSSOM

1870-148296-0041 ASKED THE CLOWN WITH THE ASS'S HEAD HE DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT THE QUEEN'S AFFECTION

1870-148296-0044 SAID THE CLOWN BUT PLEASE DON'T LET ANY OF YOUR PEOPLE DISTURB ME I AM GOING TO SLEEP THEN SAID THE QUEEN AND I WILL WIND THEE IN MY ARMS AND SO WHEN OBERON CAME ALONG
1870-148296-0045 HE FOUND HIS BEAUTIFUL QUEEN LAVISHING KISSES AND ENDEARMENTS ON A CLOWN WITH A DONKEY'S HEAD AND BEFORE HE RELEASED HER FROM THE ENCHANTMENT
1870-148296-0046 HE PERSUADED HER TO GIVE HIM THE LITTLE INDIAN BOY HE SO MUCH DESIRED TO HAVE THEN HE TOOK PITY ON HER AND THREW SOME JUICE OF THE DISENCHANTING FLOWER ON HER PRETTY EYES
1870-148296-0047 AND THEN IN A MOMENT SHE SAW PLAINLY THE DONKEY HEADED CLOWN SHE HAD BEEN LOVING AND KNEW HOW FOOLISH SHE HAD BEEN OBERON TOOK OFF THE ASS'S HEAD FROM THE CLOWN AND LEFT HIM TO FINISH HIS SLEEP WITH HIS OWN SILLY HEAD
1870-148296-0048 THUS ALL WAS MADE PLAIN AND STRAIGHT AGAIN OBERON AND TITANIA LOVED EACH OTHER MORE THAN EVER DEMETRIUS THOUGHT OF NO ONE BUT HELENA AND HELENA HAD NEVER HAD ANY THOUGHT OF ANYONE BUT DEMETRIUS
1870-148296-0049 AS FOR HERMIA AND LYSANDER THEY WERE AS LOVING A COUPLE AS YOU COULD MEET IN A DAY'S MARCH EVEN THROUGH A FAIRY WOOD SO THE FOUR MORTAL LOVERS WENT BACK TO ATHENS AND WERE MARRIED
