3098-5406-0000 IN THE LATITUDE OF CUBA AND THE CAPE VERD ISLANDS THE DELIGHTFUL TRADE WINDS HAD NOT FANNED THE SEA ON A FINER SUMMER'S DAY FOR A TWELVEMONTH AND THE WAVES WERE DAINTILY SWELLING UPON THE HEAVING BOSOM OF THE DEEP AS THOUGH INDICATING THE RESPIRATION OF THE OCEAN
3098-5406-0001 IT WAS SCARCELY A DAY'S SAIL BEYOND THE FLOW OF THE CARIBBEAN SEA THAT ONE OF THOSE NOBLEST RESULTS OF MAN'S HANDIWORK A FINE SHIP MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN GRACEFULLY PLOUGHING HER COURSE THROUGH THE SKY BLUE WATERS OF THE ATLANTIC
3098-5406-0002 THAT GAVE HER TAUT RIG AND SAUCY AIR A DASH OF MYSTERY WHICH WOULD HAVE SET HIM TO SPECULATING AT ONCE AS TO HER CHARACTER
3098-5406-0003 ALL SO COMPLETE AND WELL CONTROLLED
3098-5406-0004 NO WONDER HE DISCOURSES OF HER CHARMS WITH THE ELOQUENCE OF TRUE LOVE AND CONFIDING TRUST NO LANDSMAN CAN BE MORE ENAMORED OF HIS PROMISED BRIDE BUT THE CRAFT TO WHICH WE ESPECIALLY REFER AT THE PRESENT WRITING
3098-5406-0005 WAS A COQUETTE OF THE FIRST CLASS BEAUTIFUL IN THE EXTREME AND RICHLY MERITING THE NAME THAT HER OWNERS HAD PLACED IN GOLDEN LETTERS ON HER STERN THE SEA WITCH SHE WAS ONE OF THAT CLASS OF VESSELS KNOWN AS FLAT UPON THE FLOOR
3098-5406-0006 A MODEL THAT CAUSED HER TO DRAW BUT LITTLE WATER AND ENABLED HER TO RUN FREE OVER A SANDBAR OR INTO AN INLET WHERE AN ORDINARY SHIP'S LONG BOAT WOULD HAVE GROUNDED SHE WAS VERY LONG AND SHARP WITH GRACEFUL CONCAVE LINES
3098-5406-0007 AND MIGHT HAVE MEASURED SOME FIVE HUNDRED TONS SPEED HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN THE MAIN OBJECT AIMED AT IN HER CONSTRUCTION THE FLATNESS OF HER FLOOR GIVING HER GREAT BUOYANCY AND HER LENGTH ENSURING FLEETNESS THESE WERE POINTS THAT WOULD AT ONCE HAVE STRUCK A SAILOR'S EYE
3098-5406-0008 AS HE BEHELD THE SHIP BOWLING GRACEFULLY ON HER COURSE BY THE POWER OF THE TRADE WINDS THAT SO CONSTANTLY BEFRIEND THE MARINERS IN THESE LATITUDES
3098-5406-0009 AND SO INDEED SHE WAS CONTRARY TO THE USUAL RIG OF WHAT ARE CALLED CLIPPER SHIPS HER MASTS INSTEAD OF RAKING WERE PERFECTLY UPRIGHT FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENABLING HER TO CARRY MORE PRESS OF SAIL WHEN NEED BE AND TO HOLD ON LONGER WHEN SPEED SHOULD BE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE
3098-5406-0010 HAVING TREMENDOUS SQUARE YARDS ENABLING THE CANVASS TO ACT MORE IMMEDIATELY UPON THE HULL INSTEAD OF OPERATING AS A LEVER ALOFT AND KEEPING THE SHIP CONSTANTLY OFF AN EVEN KEEL
3098-5406-0011 THOUGH LOW IN THE WAIST YET HER ENDS ROSE GRACEFULLY IN A CURVE TOWARDS THE TERMINATIONS FORE AND AFT MAKING HER VERY DRY ON EITHER THE QUARTER DECK OR FORECASTLE SHE MIGHT HAVE NUMBERED FIFTY MEN FOR HER CREW
3098-5406-0012 AND IF YOU HAD LOOKED IN BOARD OVER HER BULWARKS YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT HER COMPLEMENT WAS MADE UP OF MEN THERE WERE NONE THERE BUT REAL ABLE BODIED SEAMEN SEA DOGS WHO HAD ROUGHED IT IN ALL WEATHER AND ON ALL SORTS OF ALLOWANCE
3098-5406-0013 THERE WAS A QUIET AND ORDERLY MIEN ABOUT THE DECK AND AMONG THE WATCH THAT SPOKE OF THE SILENT YET POTENT ARM OF AUTHORITY THE MEN SPOKE TO EACH OTHER NOW AND THEN BUT IT WAS IN AN UNDER TONE AND THERE WAS NO OPEN LEVITY
3098-5406-0014 A FEW MEN WERE LOUNGING ABOUT THE HEEL OF THE BOWSPRIT ON THE FORECASTLE ONE OR TWO WERE BUSY IN THE WAIST COILING CABLE AN OFFICER OF SECOND OR THIRD CASTE A QUIET BUT DECIDED CHARACTER
3098-5406-0015 TO JUDGE FROM HIS FEATURES STOOD WITH FOLDED ARMS JUST ABAFT THE MIZZEN MAST AND A YOUTHFUL FIGURE ALMOST TOO YOUNG SEEMINGLY FOR SO RESPONSIBLE A POST LEANED IDLY AGAINST THE MONKEY RAIL NEAR THE SAGE OLD TAR WHO WAS AT THE HELM
3098-5406-0016 AT FIRST YOU MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED HIM A SUPERCARGO AN OWNER'S SON AS PASSENGER OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT FROM THE QUITE AT HOME AIR HE EXHIBITED BUT NOW AND THEN HE CAST ONE OF THOSE SEARCHING AND UNDERSTANDING GLANCES ALOFT AND FORE AND AFT
3098-5406-0017 TAKING IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF THE SHIP'S TRIM AND THE WAY SHE DID HER DUTY THAT YOU REALIZED AT ONCE THE FACT OF HIS POSITION AND YOU COULD NOT MISTAKE THE FACT THAT HE WAS HER COMMANDER HE WORE A GLAZED TARPAULIN HAT OF COARSE TEXTURE
3098-5406-0018 AND HIS DRESS WAS OF LITTLE BETTER MATERIAL THAN THAT OF THE CREW HE COMMANDED BUT IT SET IT SOMEHOW QUITE JAUNTILY UPON HIS FINE WELL DEVELOPED FORM AND THERE WAS AN UNMISTAKABLE AIR OF CONSCIOUS AUTHORITY ABOUT HIM THAT SHOWED HIM TO BE NO STRANGER TO CONTROL
3098-5406-0019 OR THE POSITION WHICH HE FILLED THE HAIR ESCAPING IN GLOSSY CURLS FROM BENEATH HIS HAT ADDED TO A SET OF VERY REGULAR FEATURES A FINE EFFECT WHILE A CLEAR FULL BLUE EYE AND AN OPEN INGENUOUS EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE
3098-5406-0020 TOLD OF MANLINESS OF HEART AND CHIVALRIC HARDIHOOD OF CHARACTER EXPOSURE TO THE ELEMENTS HAD BRONZED HIS SKIN BUT THERE WERE NO WRINKLES THERE AND CAPTAIN WILL RATLIN COULD NOT HAVE SEEN MORE THAN TWO AND TWENTY YEARS
3098-5406-0021 THOUGH MOST OF THEM HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN PASSED UPON THE OCEAN FOR HIS WELL KNIT FORM SHOWED HIM TO BE ONE THOROUGHLY INURED TO SERVICE SHE DOES HER WORK DAINTILY CAPTAIN RATLIN
3098-5406-0022 SAID HE WHO WAS EVIDENTLY AN OFFICER AND WHO HAD BEEN STANDING BY THE MAINMAST BUT NOW WALKED AFT YES MISTER FAULKNER DAINTILY IS THE WORD I WISH OUR BEAUTY COULD BE A LITTLE MORE SPUNKY TIME IS MONEY IN OUR BUSINESS SIR WAS THE PROMPT REPLY
3098-5406-0023 BUT THE WILLING CRAFT DOES ALL SHE CAN SIR I DON'T KNOW MISTER FAULKNER WE CAN MAKE HER DO ALMOST ANYTHING BUT TALK ADDED THE MATE AY SHE WILL DO THAT IN HER OWN WAY AND ELOQUENTLY TOO CONTINUED HIS SUPERIOR
3098-5406-0024 IN COMING OUT OF MATANZAS WHEN YOU MADE HER BACK AND FILL LIKE A SADDLE HORSE I THOUGHT SHE WAS LITTLE LESS THAN A HUMAN BEING SAID THE MATE HONESTLY SHE MINDS HER HELM LIKE A BEAUTY
3098-5406-0025 SHE EATS RIGHT INTO IT AND YET HAS NOT SHAKEN A FOOT OF CANVASS THIS HALF HOUR THAT IS WELL IT'S UNCOMMON SIR CONTINUED THE OTHER SHE MUST AND CAN DO BETTER THOUGH SAID THE YOUNG COMMANDER WITH AN AIR OF SLIGHT IMPATIENCE
3098-5406-0026 CALL THE WATCH BELOW MISTER FAULKNER WE WILL TREAT OUR MISTRESS TO A NEW DRESS THIS BRIGHT DAY AND FLATTER HER PRIDE A LITTLE SHE IS OF THE COQUETTE SCHOOL AND WILL BEAR A LITTLE DALLIANCE
3098-5406-0027 AND WITH A FEW QUICK BLOWS WITH A HANDSPIKE AND A CLEAR CALL HE SUMMONED THAT PORTION OF THE CREW WHOSE HOURS OF RELEASE FROM DUTY PERMITTED THEM BELOW THE SIGNAL RANG SHARPLY THROUGH THE SHIP AND CAUSED AN INSTANT RESPONSE A SCORE OF DARK FORMS ISSUED FORTH FROM THE FORECASTLE
3098-5406-0028 EMBRACING REPRESENTATIVES FROM NEARLY HALF THE NATIONS OF THE GLOBE BUT THEY WERE STURDY SAILORS AND USED TO OBEY THE WORD OF COMMAND MEN TO BE RELIED UPON IN AN EMERGENCY ROUGH IN EXTERIOR BUT WITHIN EITHER SOFT AS WOMEN OR HARD AS STEEL ACCORDING TO THE OCCASION
3098-5406-0029 SUDDENLY THE MIZZEN ROYAL DISAPPEARED FOLLOWED BY THE TOP GALLANT SAIL TOPSAIL AND CROSS JACK COURSES SEEMING TO MELT AWAY UNDER THE EYE LIKE A MISTY VEIL WHILE ALMOST IN A MOMENT OF TIME THERE APPEARED A SPANKER GAFF TOPSAIL
3098-5406-0030 AND GAFF TOP GALLANTSAIL IN THEIR PLACE WHILE THE VESSEL STILL HELD ON HER COURSE A MOMENT LATER AND THE ROYAL TOP GALLANTSAIL TOPSAIL AND MAINSAIL DISAPPEAR FROM THE MAIN MAST
3098-5406-0031 UPON WHICH APPEARS A REGULAR FORE AND AFT SUIT OF CANVASS CONSISTING OF MAINSAIL GAFF TOPSAIL AND GAFF TOP GALLANTSAIL REDUCING THE VESSEL TO A SQUARE RIG FORWARD AND A PLAIN FORE AND AFT RIG AFT
3098-5406-0032 A FEW MINUTES MORE AND THE FOREMAST PASSED THROUGH THE SAME METAMORPHOSE LEAVING THE SEA WITCH A THREE MASTED SCHOONER WITH FORE AND AFT SAILS ON EVERY MAST AND EVERY STAY
3098-5406-0033 EACH MAN REQUIRING TO WORK WITH MARKED INTELLIGENCE FIFTY WELL DRILLED MEN THOROUGH SEA DOGS CAN TURN A FIVE HUNDRED TON SHIP INSIDE OUT
3098-5406-0034 IF THE CONTROLLING MIND UNDERSTANDS HIS POSITION ON THE QUARTER DECK SHE WEARS THAT DRESS AS THOUGH IT SUITED HER TASTE EXACTLY MISTER FAULKNER SAID THE CAPTAIN RUNNING HIS EYE OVER THE VESSEL AND GLANCING OVER THE SIDE TO MARK HER HEADWAY
3098-5406-0035 ANY RIG BECOMES THE SEA WITCH ANSWERED THE OFFICER WITH EVIDENT PRIDE THAT IS TRUE RETURNED THE CAPTAIN LUFF SIR LUFF A BIT SO WELL HE CONTINUED TO THE MAN AT THE HELM WE WILL HAVE ALL OF HER WEATHERLY POINTS THAT SITE WILL GIVE
3098-5406-0036 THE WIND IS RATHER MORE UNSTEADY THAN IT WAS AN HOUR PAST SAID MISTER FAULKNER RATHER PUFFY AND TWICE I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAUL RIGHT ABOUT BUT HERE WE HAVE IT STILL FROM THE NORTH'RD AND EAST'RD REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
3098-5406-0037 HERE IT IS AGAIN ADDED THE MATE AS THE WIND HAULED ONCE MORE THE IMMEDIATE OBJECT OF THE CHANGE IN THE VESSEL'S RIG WHICH WE HAVE DESCRIBED WAS AT ONCE APPARENT ENABLING THE VESSEL TO LIE NEARER THE WIND IN HER COURSE
3098-5406-0038 AS WELL ITS GIVING HER INCREASED VELOCITY BY BRINGING MORE CANVASS TO DRAW THAN A SQUARE RIG COULD DO WHEN CLOSE HAULED BUT A SHREWD OBSERVER WOULD HAVE BEEN LED TO ASK WHAT OTHER REASON SAVE THAT OF DISGUISE
3098-5406-0039 COULD HAVE BEEN THE ACTUATING MOTIVE IN THUS GIVING TO THE SEA WITCH A DOUBLE CHARACTER IN HER RIG FOR THOUGH TEMPORARY AND SOMEWHAT IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE COULD AT TIMES BE THUS GAINED
3098-5406-0040 AS WE HAVE SEEN YET SUCH AN OBJECT ALONE WOULD NOT HAVE WARRANTED THE INCREASED OUTLAY THAT WAS NECESSARILY INCURRED TO SAY NOTHING OF THE IMPERATIVE NECESSITY OF A VESSEL'S BEING VERY STRONGLY MANNED IN ORDER TO ENABLE HER
3098-5406-0041 TO THUS CHANGE HER ENTIRE ASPECT WITH ANY ORDINARY DEGREE OF CELERITY
