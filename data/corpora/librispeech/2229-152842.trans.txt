2229-152842-0000 CHAPTER NINE I REPENT I LAID THE MANUSCRIPT DOWN CONSOLED TO FIND THAT MY FATHER HAD HAD A PEEP INTO THAT MYSTERIOUS WORLD AND THAT HE KNEW MISTER RAVEN
2229-152842-0001 THEN I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD NEVER HEARD THE CAUSE OR ANY CIRCUMSTANCE OF MY FATHER'S DEATH AND BEGAN TO BELIEVE THAT HE MUST AT LAST HAVE FOLLOWED MISTER RAVEN AND NOT COME BACK WHEREUPON I SPEEDILY GREW ASHAMED OF MY FLIGHT
2229-152842-0002 WHAT WONDROUS FACTS MIGHT I NOT BY THIS TIME HAVE GATHERED CONCERNING LIFE AND DEATH AND WIDE REGIONS BEYOND ORDINARY PERCEPTION ASSUREDLY THE RAVENS WERE GOOD PEOPLE
2229-152842-0003 THEY WERE DOUBTLESS STRANGE BUT IT WAS FACULTY IN WHICH THE ONE WAS PECULIAR AND BEAUTY IN WHICH THE OTHER WAS MARVELLOUS AND I HAD NOT BELIEVED IN THEM HAD TREATED THEM AS UNWORTHY OF MY CONFIDENCE AS HARBOURING A DESIGN AGAINST ME
2229-152842-0004 THE MORE I THOUGHT OF MY BEHAVIOUR TO THEM THE MORE DISGUSTED I BECAME WITH MYSELF WHY SHOULD I HAVE FEARED SUCH DEAD TO SHARE THEIR HOLY REST WAS AN HONOUR OF WHICH I HAD PROVED MYSELF UNWORTHY
2229-152842-0005 WHAT HARM COULD THAT SLEEPING KING THAT LADY WITH THE WOUND IN HER PALM HAVE DONE ME I FELL A LONGING AFTER THE SWEET AND STATELY STILLNESS OF THEIR TWO COUNTENANCES AND WEPT
2229-152842-0006 WEEPING I THREW MYSELF ON A COUCH AND SUDDENLY FELL ASLEEP AS SUDDENLY I WOKE FEELING AS IF SOME ONE HAD CALLED ME THE HOUSE WAS STILL AS AN EMPTY CHURCH
2229-152842-0007 A BLACKBIRD WAS SINGING ON THE LAWN I SAID TO MYSELF I WILL GO AND TELL THEM I AM ASHAMED AND WILL DO WHATEVER THEY WOULD HAVE ME DO I ROSE AND WENT STRAIGHT UP THE STAIRS TO THE GARRET
2229-152842-0008 THE WOODEN CHAMBER WAS JUST AS WHEN FIRST I SAW IT THE MIRROR DIMLY REFLECTING EVERYTHING BEFORE IT IT WAS NEARLY NOON AND THE SUN WOULD BE A LITTLE HIGHER THAN WHEN FIRST I CAME
2229-152842-0009 I MUST RAISE THE HOOD A LITTLE AND ADJUST THE MIRRORS ACCORDINGLY IF I HAD BUT BEEN IN TIME TO SEE MISTER RAVEN DO IT I PULLED THE CHAINS AND LET THE LIGHT FALL ON THE FIRST MIRROR I TURNED THEN TO THE OTHER
2229-152842-0010 THERE WERE THE SHAPES OF THE FORMER VISION DISTINGUISHABLE INDEED BUT TREMULOUS LIKE A LANDSCAPE IN A POOL RUFFLED BY A SMALL PIPLING WIND I TOUCHED THE GLASS IT WAS IMPERMEABLE
2229-152842-0011 SUSPECTING POLARISATION AS THE THING REQUIRED I SHIFTED AND SHIFTED THE MIRRORS CHANGING THEIR RELATION UNTIL AT LAST IN A GREAT DEGREE SO FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED BY CHANCE THINGS CAME RIGHT BETWEEN THEM
2229-152842-0012 AND I SAW THE MOUNTAINS BLUE AND STEADY AND CLEAR I STEPPED FORWARD AND MY FEET WERE AMONG THE HEATHER ALL I KNEW OF THE WAY TO THE COTTAGE WAS THAT WE HAD GONE THROUGH A PINE FOREST
2229-152842-0013 I PASSED THROUGH MANY THICKETS AND SEVERAL SMALL FIR WOODS CONTINUALLY FANCYING AFRESH THAT I RECOGNISED SOMETHING OF THE COUNTRY BUT I HAD COME UPON NO FOREST AND NOW THE SUN WAS NEAR THE HORIZON AND THE AIR HAD BEGUN TO GROW CHILL WITH THE COMING WINTER
2229-152842-0014 WHEN TO MY DELIGHT I SAW A LITTLE BLACK OBJECT COMING TOWARD ME IT WAS INDEED THE RAVEN I HASTENED TO MEET HIM I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR FOR MY RUDENESS LAST NIGHT I SAID WILL YOU TAKE ME WITH YOU NOW
2229-152842-0015 I HEARTILY CONFESS I DO NOT DESERVE IT AH HE RETURNED AND LOOKED UP THEN AFTER A BRIEF PAUSE MY WIFE DOES NOT EXPECT YOU TO NIGHT HE SAID SHE REGRETS THAT WE AT ALL ENCOURAGED YOUR STAYING LAST WEEK
2229-152842-0016 TAKE ME TO HER THAT I MAY TELL HER HOW SORRY I AM I BEGGED HUMBLY IT IS OF NO USE HE ANSWERED YOUR NIGHT WAS NOT COME THEN OR YOU WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT US IT IS NOT COME NOW AND I CANNOT SHOW YOU THE WAY
2229-152842-0017 THE DEAD WERE REJOICING UNDER THEIR DAISIES THEY ALL LIE AMONG THE ROOTS OF THE FLOWERS OF HEAVEN AT THE THOUGHT OF YOUR DELIGHT WHEN THE WINTER SHOULD BE PAST AND THE MORNING WITH ITS BIRDS COME ERE YOU LEFT THEM THEY SHIVERED IN THEIR BEDS
2229-152842-0018 WHEN THE SPRING OF THE UNIVERSE ARRIVES BUT THAT CANNOT BE FOR AGES YET HOW MANY I DO NOT KNOW AND DO NOT CARE TO KNOW TELL ME ONE THING I BEG OF YOU MISTER RAVEN IS MY FATHER WITH YOU HAVE YOU SEEN HIM SINCE HE LEFT THE WORLD
2229-152842-0019 YES HE IS WITH US FAST ASLEEP THAT WAS HE YOU SAW WITH HIS ARM ON THE COVERLET HIS HAND HALF CLOSED WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO NEAR HIM AND NOT KNOW

2229-152842-0023 AND MY GRANDFATHER IS HE ALSO WITH YOU I ASKED NO HE IS STILL IN THE EVIL WOOD FIGHTING THE DEAD WHERE IS THE EVIL WOOD THAT I MAY FIND HIM YOU WILL NOT FIND HIM
2229-152842-0024 BUT YOU WILL HARDLY MISS THE WOOD IT IS THE PLACE WHERE THOSE WHO WILL NOT SLEEP WAKE UP AT NIGHT TO KILL THEIR DEAD AND BURY THEM I CANNOT UNDERSTAND YOU NATURALLY NOT NEITHER DO I UNDERSTAND YOU
2229-152842-0025 I CAN READ NEITHER YOUR HEART NOR YOUR FACE WHEN MY WIFE AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND OUR CHILDREN IT IS BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH OF THEM TO BE UNDERSTOOD GOD ALONE CAN UNDERSTAND FOOLISHNESS
2229-152842-0026 THERE ARE MORE WAYS THAN ONE I KNOW FOR I HAVE GONE BY TWO ALREADY THERE ARE INDEED MANY WAYS TELL ME PLEASE HOW TO RECOGNISE THE NEAREST I CANNOT ANSWERED THE RAVEN
2229-152842-0027 YOU AND I USE THE SAME WORDS WITH DIFFERENT MEANINGS WE ARE OFTEN UNABLE TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW BECAUSE THEY WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING ELSE AND WOULD THEREFORE ONLY MISUNDERSTAND WHAT WE SAID
2229-152842-0028 HOME IS EVER SO FAR AWAY IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND AND HOW TO GET THERE IT IS OF NO USE TO TELL YOU BUT YOU WILL GET THERE YOU MUST GET THERE YOU HAVE TO GET THERE EVERYBODY WHO IS NOT AT HOME
2229-152842-0029 YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE AT HOME WHERE I FOUND YOU IF THAT HAD BEEN YOUR HOME YOU COULD NOT HAVE LEFT IT NOBODY CAN LEAVE HOME AND NOBODY EVER WAS OR EVER WILL BE AT HOME WITHOUT HAVING GONE THERE
2229-152842-0030 ENIGMA TREADING ON ENIGMA I EXCLAIMED I DID NOT COME HERE TO BE ASKED RIDDLES NO BUT YOU CAME AND FOUND THE RIDDLES WAITING FOR YOU INDEED YOU ARE YOURSELF THE ONLY RIDDLE WHAT YOU CALL RIDDLES ARE TRUTHS
2229-152842-0031 AND SEEM RIDDLES BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT TRUE WORSE AND WORSE I CRIED AND YOU MUST ANSWER THE RIDDLES HE CONTINUED THEY WILL GO ON ASKING THEMSELVES UNTIL YOU UNDERSTAND YOURSELF THE UNIVERSE IS A RIDDLE TRYING TO GET OUT
2229-152842-0032 AND YOU ARE HOLDING YOUR DOOR HARD AGAINST IT WILL YOU NOT IN PITY TELL ME WHAT I AM TO DO WHERE I MUST GO HOW SHOULD I TELL YOUR TO DO OR THE WAY TO IT IF I AM NOT TO GO HOME
2229-152842-0033 I DO NOT KNOW OF ANY THE BEINGS MOST LIKE YOU ARE IN THAT DIRECTION HE POINTED WITH HIS BEAK I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE SETTING SUN WHICH BLINDED ME WELL I SAID BITTERLY
2229-152842-0034 I CANNOT HELP FEELING HARDLY TREATED TAKEN FROM MY HOME ABANDONED IN A STRANGE WORLD AND REFUSED INSTRUCTION AS TO WHERE I AM TO GO OR WHAT I AM TO DO YOU FORGET SAID THE RAVEN THAT WHEN I BROUGHT YOU
2229-152842-0035 AND YOU DECLINED MY HOSPITALITY YOU REACHED WHAT YOU CALL HOME IN SAFETY NOW YOU ARE COME OF YOURSELF GOOD NIGHT HE TURNED AND WALKED SLOWLY AWAY WITH HIS BEAK TOWARD THE GROUND I STOOD
2229-152842-0036 DAZED IT WAS TRUE I HAD COME OF MYSELF BUT HAD I NOT COME WITH INTENT OF ATONEMENT MY HEART WAS SORE AND IN MY BRAIN WAS NEITHER QUEST NOR PURPOSE HOPE NOR DESIRE
2229-152842-0037 I GAZED AFTER THE RAVEN AND WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED HIM BUT FELT IT USELESS ALL AT ONCE HE POUNCED ON A SPOT THROWING THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF HIS BODY ON HIS BILL AND FOR SOME MOMENTS DUG VIGOROUSLY
2229-152842-0038 THEN WITH A FLUTTER OF HIS WINGS HE THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND SOMETHING SHOT FROM HIS BILL CAST HIGH IN THE AIR THAT MOMENT THE SUN SET AND THE AIR AT ONCE GREW VERY DUSK BUT THE SOMETHING
2229-152842-0039 OPENED INTO A SOFT RADIANCE AND CAME PULSING TOWARD ME LIKE A FIRE FLY BUT WITH A MUCH LARGER AND A YELLOWER LIGHT IT FLEW OVER MY HEAD I TURNED AND FOLLOWED IT
2229-152842-0040 HERE I INTERRUPT MY NARRATIVE TO REMARK THAT IT INVOLVES A CONSTANT STRUGGLE TO SAY WHAT CANNOT BE SAID WITH EVEN AN APPROACH TO PRECISION THE THINGS RECORDED BEING
2229-152842-0041 IN THEIR NATURE AND IN THAT OF THE CREATURES CONCERNED IN THEM SO INEXPRESSIBLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY POSSIBLE EVENTS OF THIS ECONOMY THAT I CAN PRESENT THEM ONLY BY GIVING IN THE FORMS AND LANGUAGE OF LIFE IN THIS WORLD THE MODES IN WHICH THEY AFFECTED ME
2229-152842-0042 NOT THE THINGS THEMSELVES BUT THE FEELINGS THEY WOKE IN ME EVEN THIS MUCH HOWEVER I DO WITH A CONTINUOUS AND ABIDING SENSE OF FAILURE FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PRESENT MORE THAN ONE PHASE
2229-152842-0043 OF A MULTITUDINOUSLY COMPLICATED SIGNIFICANCE OR ONE CONCENTRIC SPHERE OF A GRADUATED EMBODIMENT A SINGLE THING WOULD SOMETIMES SEEM TO BE AND MEAN MANY THINGS WITH AN UNCERTAIN IDENTITY AT THE HEART OF THEM
2229-152842-0044 WHICH KEPT CONSTANTLY ALTERING THEIR LOOK I AM INDEED OFTEN DRIVEN TO SET DOWN WHAT I KNOW TO BE BUT A CLUMSY AND DOUBTFUL REPRESENTATION OF THE MERE FEELING AIMED AT
2229-152842-0045 NONE OF THE COMMUNICATING MEDIA OF THIS WORLD BEING FIT TO CONVEY IT IN ITS PECULIAR STRANGENESS WITH EVEN AN APPROACH TO CLEARNESS OR CERTAINTY
