6550-53320-0000 TO BLUNDER UPON A SCENE WHICH UNFOLDED TO ME SOME OF THE MYSTERIES OF THE BOOK MAKING CRAFT AND AT ONCE PUT AN END TO MY ASTONISHMENT I WAS ONE SUMMER'S DAY LOITERING THROUGH THE GREAT SALOONS OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM WITH THAT LISTLESSNESS
6550-53320-0001 WITH WHICH ONE IS APT TO SAUNTER ABOUT A MUSEUM IN WARM WEATHER SOMETIMES LOLLING OVER THE GLASS CASES OF MINERALS SOMETIMES STUDYING THE HIEROGLYPHICS ON AN EGYPTIAN MUMMY AND SOME TIMES TRYING WITH NEARLY EQUAL SUCCESS
6550-53320-0002 TO COMPREHEND THE ALLEGORICAL PAINTINGS ON THE LOFTY CEILINGS WHILST I WAS GAZING ABOUT IN THIS IDLE WAY MY ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED TO A DISTANT DOOR AT THE END OF A SUITE OF APARTMENTS IT WAS CLOSED BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN IT WOULD OPEN
6550-53320-0003 AND SOME STRANGE FAVORED BEING GENERALLY CLOTHED IN BLACK WOULD STEAL FORTH AND GLIDE THROUGH THE ROOMS WITHOUT NOTICING ANY OF THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS THERE WAS AN AIR OF MYSTERY ABOUT THIS THAT PIQUED MY LANGUID CURIOSITY AND I DETERMINED TO ATTEMPT THE PASSAGE OF THAT STRAIT
6550-53320-0004 AND TO EXPLORE THE UNKNOWN REGIONS BEYOND THE DOOR YIELDED TO MY HAND WITH ALL THAT FACILITY WITH WHICH THE PORTALS OF ENCHANTED CASTLES YIELD TO THE ADVENTUROUS KNIGHT ERRANT I FOUND MYSELF IN A SPACIOUS CHAMBER SURROUNDED WITH GREAT CASES OF VENERABLE BOOKS
6550-53320-0005 NOW AND THEN ONE OF THESE PERSONAGES WOULD WRITE SOMETHING ON A SMALL SLIP OF PAPER AND RING A BELL WHEREUPON A FAMILIAR WOULD APPEAR TAKE THE PAPER IN PROFOUND SILENCE GLIDE OUT OF THE ROOM AND RETURN SHORTLY LOADED WITH PONDEROUS TOMES
6550-53320-0006 UPON WHICH THE OTHER WOULD FALL TOOTH AND NAIL WITH FAMISHED VORACITY I HAD NO LONGER A DOUBT THAT I HAD HAPPENED UPON A BODY OF MAGI DEEPLY ENGAGED IN THE STUDY OF OCCULT SCIENCES THE SCENE REMINDED ME OF AN OLD ARABIAN TALE
6550-53320-0007 IN THE BOSOM OF A MOUNTAIN WHICH OPENED ONLY ONCE A YEAR WHERE HE MADE THE SPIRITS OF THE PLACE BRING HIM BOOKS OF ALL KINDS OF DARK KNOWLEDGE SO THAT AT THE END OF THE YEAR WHEN THE MAGIC PORTAL ONCE MORE SWUNG OPEN ON ITS HINGES HE ISSUED FORTH SO VERSED IN FORBIDDEN LORE
6550-53320-0008 A FEW WORDS WERE SUFFICIENT FOR THE PURPOSE I FOUND THAT THESE MYSTERIOUS PERSONAGES WHOM I HAD MISTAKEN FOR MAGI WERE PRINCIPALLY AUTHORS AND WERE IN THE VERY ACT OF MANUFACTURING BOOKS I WAS IN FACT IN THE READING ROOM OF THE GREAT BRITISH LIBRARY
6550-53320-0009 BEING NOW IN POSSESSION OF THE SECRET I SAT DOWN IN A CORNER AND WATCHED THE PROCESS OF THIS BOOK MANUFACTORY I NOTICED ONE LEAN BILIOUS LOOKING WIGHT WHO SOUGHT NONE BUT THE MOST WORM EATEN VOLUMES
6550-53320-0010 PRINTED IN BLACK LETTER HE WAS EVIDENTLY CONSTRUCTING SOME WORK OF PROFOUND ERUDITION THAT WOULD BE PURCHASED BY EVERY MAN WHO WISHED TO BE THOUGHT LEARNED PLACED UPON A CONSPICUOUS SHELF OF HIS LIBRARY OR LAID OPEN UPON HIS TABLE BUT NEVER READ
6550-53320-0011 I OBSERVED HIM NOW AND THEN DRAW A LARGE FRAGMENT OF BISCUIT OUT OF HIS POCKET AND GNAW WHETHER IT WAS HIS DINNER OR WHETHER HE WAS ENDEAVORING TO KEEP OFF THAT EXHAUSTION OF THE STOMACH PRODUCED BY MUCH PONDERING OVER DRY WORKS
6550-53320-0012 I LEAVE TO HARDER STUDENTS THAN MYSELF TO DETERMINE THERE WAS ONE DAPPER LITTLE GENTLEMAN IN BRIGHT COLORED CLOTHES WITH A CHIRPING GOSSIPING EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE WHO HAD ALL THE APPEARANCE OF AN AUTHOR ON GOOD TERMS WITH HIS BOOKSELLER
6550-53320-0013 HE MADE MORE STIR AND SHOW OF BUSINESS THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS DIPPING INTO VARIOUS BOOKS FLUTTERING OVER THE LEAVES OF MANUSCRIPTS TAKING A MORSEL OUT OF ONE A MORSEL OUT OF ANOTHER LINE UPON LINE PRECEPT UPON PRECEPT HERE A LITTLE AND THERE A LITTLE
6550-53320-0014 THE CONTENTS OF HIS BOOK SEEMED TO BE AS HETEROGENEOUS AS THOSE OF THE WITCHES CAULDRON IN MACBETH IT WAS HERE A FINGER AND THERE A THUMB TOE OF FROG AND BLIND WORM'S STING
6550-53320-0015 MAY IT NOT BE THE WAY IN WHICH PROVIDENCE HAS TAKEN CARE THAT THE SEEDS OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM SHALL BE PRESERVED FROM AGE TO AGE IN SPITE OF THE INEVITABLE DECAY OF THE WORKS IN WHICH THEY WERE FIRST PRODUCED
6550-53320-0016 WE SEE THAT NATURE HAS WISELY THOUGH WHIMSICALLY PROVIDED FOR THE CONVEYANCE OF SEEDS FROM CLIME TO CLIME IN THE MAWS OF CERTAIN BIRDS SO THAT ANIMALS WHICH IN THEMSELVES ARE LITTLE BETTER THAN CARRION AND APPARENTLY THE LAWLESS PLUNDERERS OF THE ORCHARD AND THE CORN FIELD
6550-53320-0017 ARE IN FACT NATURE'S CARRIERS TO DISPERSE AND PERPETUATE HER BLESSINGS IN LIKE MANNER THE BEAUTIES AND FINE THOUGHTS OF ANCIENT AND OBSOLETE AUTHORS ARE CAUGHT UP BY THESE FLIGHTS OF PREDATORY WRITERS AND CAST FORTH AGAIN TO FLOURISH AND BEAR FRUIT
6550-53320-0018 IN A REMOTE AND DISTANT TRACT OF TIME MANY OF THEIR WORKS ALSO UNDERGO A KIND OF METEMPSYCHOSIS
6550-53320-0019 WHAT WAS FORMERLY A PONDEROUS HISTORY REVIVES IN THE SHAPE OF A ROMANCE AN OLD LEGEND CHANGES INTO A MODERN PLAY AND A SOBER PHILOSOPHICAL TREATISE FURNISHES THE BODY FOR A WHOLE SERIES OF BOUNCING AND SPARKLING ESSAYS
6550-53320-0020 THUS IT IS IN THE CLEARING OF OUR AMERICAN WOODLANDS WHERE WE BURN DOWN A FOREST OF STATELY PINES A PROGENY OF DWARF OAKS START UP IN THEIR PLACE AND WE NEVER SEE THE PROSTRATE TRUNK OF A TREE MOULDERING INTO SOIL BUT IT GIVES BIRTH TO A WHOLE TRIBE OF FUNGI
6550-53320-0021 LET US NOT THEN LAMENT OVER THE DECAY AND OBLIVION INTO WHICH ANCIENT WRITERS DESCEND
6550-53320-0022 AND THE SPECIES CONTINUE TO FLOURISH THUS ALSO DO AUTHORS BEGET AUTHORS AND HAVING PRODUCED A NUMEROUS PROGENY IN A GOOD OLD AGE THEY SLEEP WITH THEIR FATHERS THAT IS TO SAY WITH THE AUTHORS WHO PRECEDED THEM AND FROM WHOM THEY HAD STOLEN
6550-53320-0023 STILL HOWEVER MY IMAGINATION CONTINUED BUSY AND INDEED THE SAME SCENE CONTINUED BEFORE MY MIND'S EYE ONLY A LITTLE CHANGED IN SOME OF THE DETAILS I DREAMT THAT THE CHAMBER WAS STILL DECORATED WITH THE PORTRAITS OF ANCIENT AUTHORS BUT THAT THE NUMBER WAS INCREASED
6550-53320-0024 THE LONG TABLES HAD DISAPPEARED AND IN PLACE OF THE SAGE MAGI I BEHELD A RAGGED THREADBARE THRONG SUCH AS MAY BE SEEN PLYING ABOUT THE GREAT REPOSITORY OF CAST OFF CLOTHES MONMOUTH STREET WHENEVER THEY SEIZED UPON A BOOK
6550-53320-0025 BUT TOOK A SLEEVE FROM ONE A CAPE FROM ANOTHER A SKIRT FROM A THIRD THUS DECKING HIMSELF OUT PIECEMEAL WHILE SOME OF HIS ORIGINAL RAGS WOULD PEEP OUT FROM AMONG HIS BORROWED FINERY THERE WAS A PORTLY ROSY WELL FED PARSON
6550-53320-0026 WHOM I OBSERVED OGLING SEVERAL MOULDY POLEMICAL WRITERS THROUGH AN EYEGLASS HE SOON CONTRIVED TO SLIP ON THE VOLUMINOUS MANTLE OF ONE OF THE OLD FATHERS AND HAVING PURLOINED THE GRAY BEARD OF ANOTHER ENDEAVORED TO LOOK EXCEEDINGLY WISE
6550-53320-0027 BUT THE SMIRKING COMMONPLACE OF HIS COUNTENANCE SET AT NAUGHT ALL THE TRAPPINGS OF WISDOM ONE SICKLY LOOKING GENTLEMAN WAS BUSIED EMBROIDERING A VERY FLIMSY GARMENT WITH GOLD THREAD DRAWN OUT OF SEVERAL OLD COURT DRESSES OF THE REIGN OF QUEEN ELIZABETH
6550-53320-0028 AND I PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD PATCHED HIS SMALL CLOTHES WITH SCRAPS OF PARCHMENT FROM A LATIN AUTHOR THERE WERE SOME WELL DRESSED GENTLEMEN IT IS TRUE WHO ONLY HELPED THEMSELVES TO A GEM OR SO WHICH SPARKLED AMONG THEIR OWN ORNAMENTS WITHOUT ECLIPSING THEM
6550-53320-0029 SOME TOO SEEMED TO CONTEMPLATE THE COSTUMES OF THE OLD WRITERS MERELY TO IMBIBE THEIR PRINCIPLES OF TASTE AND TO CATCH THEIR AIR AND SPIRIT BUT I GRIEVE TO SAY THAT TOO MANY WERE APT TO ARRAY THEMSELVES FROM TOP TO TOE IN THE PATCHWORK MANNER I HAVE MENTIONED
6550-53320-0030 AS TO THE DAPPER LITTLE COMPILER OF FARRAGOS MENTIONED SOME TIME SINCE HE HAD ARRAYED HIMSELF IN AS MANY PATCHES AND COLORS AS HARLEQUIN AND THERE WAS AS FIERCE A CONTENTION OF CLAIMANTS ABOUT HIM AS ABOUT THE DEAD BODY OF PATROCLUS
6550-53320-0031 I WAS GRIEVED TO SEE MANY MEN TO WHOM I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LOOK UP WITH AWE AND REVERENCE FAIN TO STEAL OFF WITH SCARCE A RAG TO COVER THEIR NAKEDNESS JUST THEN MY EYE WAS CAUGHT BY THE PRAGMATICAL OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE GREEK GRIZZLED WIG
6550-53320-0032 WHO WAS SCRAMBLING AWAY IN SORE AFFRIGHT WITH HALF A SCORE OF AUTHORS IN FULL CRY AFTER HIM THEY WERE CLOSE UPON HIS HAUNCHES IN A TWINKLING OFF WENT HIS WIG AT EVERY TURN SOME STRIP OF RAIMENT WAS PEELED AWAY UNTIL IN A FEW MOMENTS FROM HIS DOMINEERING POMP
6550-53320-0033 HE SHRUNK INTO A LITTLE PURSY CHOPP'D BALD SHOT AND MADE HIS EXIT WITH ONLY A FEW TAGS AND RAGS FLUTTERING AT HIS BACK
6550-53320-0034 WHICH BROKE THE WHOLE ILLUSION THE TUMULT AND THE SCUFFLE WERE AT AN END THE CHAMBER RESUMED ITS USUAL APPEARANCE
6550-53320-0035 ALONG THE WALLS IN SHORT I FOUND MYSELF WIDE AWAKE IN MY CORNER WITH THE WHOLE ASSEMBLAGE OF HOOKWORMS GAZING AT ME WITH ASTONISHMENT NOTHING OF THE DREAM HAD BEEN REAL BUT MY BURST OF LAUGHTER
