5717-61421-0000 THOUGH HE DID INDEED DESERVE TO BE MORE THAN DESPISED HE MOANED AT FIRST BILLY DID NOT SPEAK OR EVEN VOUCHSAFE A GLANCE IN HIS DIRECTION VERY QUIETLY SHE WENT ABOUT HER PREPARATIONS FOR A SIMPLE MEAL
5717-61421-0001 PAYING APPARENTLY NO MORE ATTENTION TO BERTRAM
5717-61421-0002 BUT THAT HER EARS WERE ONLY SEEMINGLY AND NOT REALLY DEAF WAS SHOWN VERY CLEARLY A LITTLE LATER WHEN AT A PARTICULARLY ABJECT WAIL ON THE PART OF THE BABBLING SHADOW AT HER HEELS BILLY CHOKED INTO A LITTLE GASP
5717-61421-0003 HALF LAUGHTER HALF SOB IT WAS ALL OVER THEN BERTRAM HAD HER IN HIS ARMS IN A TWINKLING WHILE TO THE FLOOR CLATTERED AND ROLLED A KNIFE AND A HALF PEELED BAKED POTATO NATURALLY AFTER THAT
5717-61421-0004 THERE COULD BE NO MORE DIGNIFIED SILENCES ON THE PART OF THE INJURED WIFE THERE WERE INSTEAD HALF SMILES TEARS SOBS A TREMULOUS TELLING OF PETE'S GOING AND HIS MESSAGES
5717-61421-0005 FOLLOWED BY A TEARFUL LISTENING TO BERTRAM'S STORY OF THE TORTURE HE HAD ENDURED AT THE HANDS OF MISS WINTHROP BESSIE BAILEY AND AN EMPTY DINNERLESS HOUSE AND THUS IN ONE CORNER OF THE KITCHEN SOME TIME LATER
5717-61421-0006 THE HALF PEELED COLD BAKED POTATO STILL AT THEIR FEET TORN BETWEEN HIS CRAVING FOR FOOD AND HIS DESIRE NOT TO INTERFERE WITH ANY POSSIBLE PEACE MAKING WILLIAM WAS OBVIOUSLY HESITATING WHAT TO DO WHEN BILLY GLANCED UP AND SAW HIM
5717-61421-0007 WITH NOT A THING TO EAT YET THEY ALL GOT DINNER THEN TOGETHER WITH MANY A SIGH AND QUICK COMING TEAR AS EVERYWHERE THEY MET SOME SAD REMINDER OF THE GENTLE OLD HANDS THAT WOULD NEVER AGAIN MINISTER TO THEIR COMFORT
5717-61421-0008 IT WAS A SILENT MEAL AND LITTLE AFTER ALL WAS EATEN THOUGH BRAVE ATTEMPTS AT CHEERFULNESS AND NATURALNESS WERE MADE BY ALL THREE
5717-61421-0009 BERTRAM ESPECIALLY TALKED AND TRIED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SHADOW ON BILLY'S FACE WAS AT LEAST NOT THE ONE HIS OWN CONDUCT HAD BROUGHT THERE FOR YOU DO YOU SURELY DO FORGIVE ME DON'T YOU HE BEGGED
5717-61421-0010 AS HE FOLLOWED HER INTO THE KITCHEN AFTER THE SORRY MEAL WAS OVER WHY YES DEAR YES SIGHED BILLY TRYING TO SMILE AND YOU'LL FORGET THERE WAS NO ANSWER BILLY AND YOU'LL FORGET BERTRAM'S VOICE WAS INSISTENT REPROACHFUL
5717-61421-0011 BILLY CHANGED COLOR AND BIT HER LIP SHE LOOKED PLAINLY DISTRESSED BILLY CRIED THE MAN STILL MORE REPROACHFULLY BUT BERTRAM I CAN'T FORGET QUITE YET FALTERED BILLY
5717-61421-0012 BERTRAM FROWNED FOR A MINUTE HE LOOKED AS IF HE WERE ABOUT TO TAKE UP THE MATTER SERIOUSLY AND ARGUE IT WITH HER BUT THE NEXT MOMENT HE SMILED AND TOSSED HIS HEAD WITH JAUNTY PLAYFULNESS BERTRAM TO TELL THE TRUTH
5717-61421-0013 AND MANLIKE HE WAS VERY ARDENTLY LONGING FOR THE OLD EASY GOING FRIENDLINESS WITH ALL UNPLEASANTNESS BANISHED TO OBLIVION OH BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGET HE CLAIMED WITH CHEERY INSISTENCE FOR YOU'VE PROMISED TO FORGIVE ME
5717-61421-0014 AND ONE CAN'T FORGIVE WITHOUT FORGETTING SO THERE HE FINISHED WITH A SMILINGLY DETERMINED NOW EVERYTHING IS JUST AS IT WAS BEFORE AIR BILLY MADE NO RESPONSE
