6373-65772-0000 AS TO LEAVE NO DOUBT ON MY MIND THAT LONG ERE THIS ALL EUROPE IS IN AN UPROAR ALL PHYSICS IN A FERMENT ALL REASON AND ASTRONOMY TOGETHER BY THE EARS IT APPEARS THAT ON THE
6373-65772-0001 I AM NOT POSITIVE ABOUT THE DATE A VAST CROWD OF PEOPLE FOR PURPOSES NOT SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED WERE ASSEMBLED IN THE GREAT SQUARE OF THE EXCHANGE IN THE WELL CONDITIONED CITY OF ROTTERDAM THE DAY WAS WARM
6373-65772-0002 WHICH CHEQUERED IN A FITFUL MANNER THE BLUE VAULT OF THE FIRMAMENT NEVERTHELESS ABOUT NOON A SLIGHT BUT REMARKABLE AGITATION BECAME APPARENT IN THE ASSEMBLY THE CLATTERING OF TEN THOUSAND TONGUES SUCCEEDED AND IN AN INSTANT AFTERWARD
6373-65772-0003 TEN THOUSAND FACES WERE UPTURNED TOWARD THE HEAVENS TEN THOUSAND PIPES DESCENDED SIMULTANEOUSLY FROM THE CORNERS OF TEN THOUSAND MOUTHS AND A SHOUT WHICH COULD BE COMPARED TO NOTHING BUT THE ROARING OF NIAGARA
6373-65772-0004 RESOUNDED LONG LOUDLY AND FURIOUSLY THROUGH ALL THE ENVIRONS OF ROTTERDAM THE ORIGIN OF THIS HUBBUB SOON BECAME SUFFICIENTLY EVIDENT
6373-65772-0005 FROM BEHIND THE HUGE BULK OF ONE OF THOSE SHARPLY DEFINED MASSES OF CLOUD ALREADY MENTIONED WAS SEEN SLOWLY TO EMERGE INTO AN OPEN AREA OF BLUE SPACE A QUEER HETEROGENEOUS BUT APPARENTLY SOLID SUBSTANCE
6373-65772-0006 SO ODDLY SHAPED SO WHIMSICALLY PUT TOGETHER AS NOT TO BE IN ANY MANNER COMPREHENDED AND NEVER TO BE SUFFICIENTLY ADMIRED BY THE HOST OF STURDY BURGHERS WHO STOOD OPEN MOUTHED BELOW
6373-65772-0007 WHAT COULD IT BE IN THE NAME OF ALL THE VROWS AND DEVILS IN ROTTERDAM WHAT COULD IT POSSIBLY PORTEND NO ONE KNEW NO ONE COULD IMAGINE NO ONE
6373-65772-0008 HAD THE SLIGHTEST CLEW BY WHICH TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY SO AS NOTHING MORE REASONABLE COULD BE DONE EVERY ONE TO A MAN REPLACED HIS PIPE CAREFULLY IN THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH AND COCKING UP HIS RIGHT EYE TOWARDS THE PHENOMENON PUFFED
6373-65772-0009 PAUSED WADDLED ABOUT AND GRUNTED SIGNIFICANTLY THEN WADDLED BACK GRUNTED PAUSED AND FINALLY PUFFED AGAIN
6373-65772-0010 CAME THE OBJECT OF SO MUCH CURIOSITY AND THE CAUSE OF SO MUCH SMOKE IN A VERY FEW MINUTES IT ARRIVED NEAR ENOUGH TO BE ACCURATELY DISCERNED IT APPEARED TO BE YES IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A SPECIES OF BALLOON
6373-65772-0011 BUT SURELY NO SUCH BALLOON HAD EVER BEEN SEEN IN ROTTERDAM BEFORE
6373-65772-0012 BEING LITTLE OR NOTHING BETTER THAN A HUGE FOOLSCAP TURNED UPSIDE DOWN AND THIS SIMILITUDE WAS REGARDED AS BY NO MEANS LESSENED WHEN UPON NEARER INSPECTION THERE WAS PERCEIVED A LARGE TASSEL DEPENDING FROM ITS APEX
6373-65772-0013 IT IS HOWEVER SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE THAT MANY CITIZENS OF ROTTERDAM SWORE TO HAVING SEEN THE SAME HAT REPEATEDLY BEFORE AND INDEED THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY SEEMED TO REGARD IT WITH EYES OF FAMILIARITY
6373-65772-0014 HAD ACTUALLY DISAPPEARED FROM ROTTERDAM ABOUT FIVE YEARS BEFORE
6373-65772-0015 HAD BEEN LATELY DISCOVERED IN A RETIRED SITUATION TO THE EAST OF ROTTERDAM AND SOME PEOPLE WENT SO FAR AS TO IMAGINE THAT IN THIS SPOT A FOUL MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED AND THAT THE SUFFERERS WERE IN ALL PROBABILITY HANS PFAALL AND HIS ASSOCIATES
6373-65772-0016 BUT TO RETURN THE BALLOON FOR SUCH NO DOUBT IT WAS HAD NOW DESCENDED TO WITHIN A HUNDRED FEET OF THE EARTH ALLOWING THE CROWD BELOW A SUFFICIENTLY DISTINCT VIEW OF THE PERSON OF ITS OCCUPANT
6373-65772-0017 THIS WAS IN TRUTH A VERY DROLL LITTLE SOMEBODY HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE THAN TWO FEET IN HEIGHT BUT THIS ALTITUDE LITTLE AS IT WAS WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO DESTROY HIS EQUILIBRIUM AND TILT HIM OVER THE EDGE OF HIS TINY CAR
6373-65772-0018 BUT FOR THE INTERVENTION OF A CIRCULAR RIM REACHING AS HIGH AS THE BREAST AND RIGGED ON TO THE CORDS OF THE BALLOON THE BODY OF THE LITTLE MAN WAS MORE THAN PROPORTIONATELY BROAD GIVING TO HIS ENTIRE FIGURE A ROTUNDITY HIGHLY ABSURD
6373-65772-0019 HIS FEET OF COURSE COULD NOT BE SEEN AT ALL ALTHOUGH A HORNY SUBSTANCE OF SUSPICIOUS NATURE WAS OCCASIONALLY PROTRUDED THROUGH A RENT IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR OR TO SPEAK MORE PROPERLY IN THE TOP OF THE HAT
6373-65772-0020 THIS ODD LITTLE GENTLEMAN WAS DRESSED IN A LOOSE SURTOUT OF SKY BLUE SATIN WITH TIGHT BREECHES TO MATCH FASTENED WITH SILVER BUCKLES AT THE KNEES HIS VEST WAS OF SOME BRIGHT YELLOW MATERIAL
6373-65772-0021 A WHITE TAFFETY CAP WAS SET JAUNTILY ON ONE SIDE OF HIS HEAD AND TO COMPLETE HIS EQUIPMENT A BLOOD RED SILK HANDKERCHIEF ENVELOPED HIS THROAT AND FELL DOWN IN A DAINTY MANNER UPON HIS BOSOM
6373-65772-0022 IN A FANTASTIC BOW KNOT OF SUPER EMINENT DIMENSIONS HAVING DESCENDED AS I SAID BEFORE TO ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FEET FROM THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SUDDENLY SEIZED WITH A FIT OF TREPIDATION
6373-65772-0023 AND APPEARED DISINCLINED TO MAKE ANY NEARER APPROACH TO TERRA FIRMA THROWING OUT THEREFORE A QUANTITY OF SAND FROM A CANVAS BAG WHICH HE LIFTED WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY HE BECAME STATIONARY IN AN INSTANT
6373-65772-0024 HE THEN PROCEEDED IN A HURRIED AND AGITATED MANNER TO EXTRACT FROM A SIDE POCKET IN HIS SURTOUT A LARGE MOROCCO POCKET BOOK THIS HE POISED SUSPICIOUSLY IN HIS HAND
6373-65772-0025 THEN EYED IT WITH AN AIR OF EXTREME SURPRISE AND WAS EVIDENTLY ASTONISHED AT ITS WEIGHT HE AT LENGTH OPENED IT AND DRAWING THERE FROM A HUGE LETTER SEALED WITH RED SEALING WAX AND TIED CAREFULLY WITH RED TAPE
6373-65772-0026 LET IT FALL PRECISELY AT THE FEET OF THE BURGOMASTER SUPERBUS VON UNDERDUK HIS EXCELLENCY STOOPED TO TAKE IT UP BUT THE AERONAUT STILL GREATLY DISCOMPOSED
6373-65772-0027 BEGAN AT THIS MOMENT TO MAKE BUSY PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE AND IT BEING NECESSARY TO DISCHARGE A PORTION OF BALLAST TO ENABLE HIM TO REASCEND THE HALF DOZEN BAGS WHICH HE THREW OUT ONE AFTER ANOTHER
6373-65772-0028 WITHOUT TAKING THE TROUBLE TO EMPTY THEIR CONTENTS TUMBLED EVERY ONE OF THEM MOST UNFORTUNATELY UPON THE BACK OF THE BURGOMASTER
6373-65772-0029 TO WHICH HE HELD FAST THE WHOLE TIME WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND TO WHICH HE INTENDS HOLDING FAST UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEATH IN THE MEANTIME THE BALLOON AROSE LIKE A LARK AND SOARING FAR AWAY ABOVE THE CITY
6373-65772-0030 AT LENGTH DRIFTED QUIETLY BEHIND A CLOUD SIMILAR TO THAT FROM WHICH IT HAD SO ODDLY EMERGED AND WAS THUS LOST FOREVER TO THE WONDERING EYES OF THE GOOD CITIZENS OF ROTTERDAM
6373-65772-0031 ALL ATTENTION WAS NOW DIRECTED TO THE LETTER THE DESCENT OF WHICH AND THE CONSEQUENCES ATTENDING THEREUPON HAD PROVED SO FATALLY SUBVERSIVE OF BOTH PERSON AND PERSONAL DIGNITY TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE ILLUSTRIOUS BURGOMASTER
6373-65772-0032 BEING ACTUALLY ADDRESSED TO HIMSELF AND PROFESSOR RUB A DUB IN THEIR OFFICIAL CAPACITIES OF PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE ROTTERDAM COLLEGE OF ASTRONOMY IT WAS ACCORDINGLY OPENED BY THOSE DIGNITARIES UPON THE SPOT
6373-65772-0033 IN A MANNER WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BY ALL PARTIES AT ONCE SUDDEN AND EXTREMELY UNACCOUNTABLE IF HOWEVER IT SO PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCIES I THE WRITER OF THIS COMMUNICATION AM THE IDENTICAL HANS PFAALL HIMSELF
6373-65772-0034 IT IS WELL KNOWN TO MOST OF MY FELLOW CITIZENS THAT FOR THE PERIOD OF FORTY YEARS I CONTINUED TO OCCUPY THE LITTLE SQUARE BRICK BUILDING AT THE HEAD OF THE ALLEY CALLED SAUERKRAUT IN WHICH I RESIDED AT THE TIME OF MY DISAPPEARANCE
6373-65772-0035 MY ANCESTORS HAVE ALSO RESIDED THEREIN TIME OUT OF MIND THEY AS WELL AS MYSELF STEADILY FOLLOWING THE RESPECTABLE AND INDEED LUCRATIVE PROFESSION OF MENDING OF BELLOWS
6373-65772-0036 BUT AS I WAS SAYING WE SOON BEGAN TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF LIBERTY AND LONG SPEECHES AND RADICALISM AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING PEOPLE WHO WERE FORMERLY THE VERY BEST CUSTOMERS IN THE WORLD HAD NOW NOT A MOMENT OF TIME TO THINK OF US AT ALL
6373-65772-0037 OR REQUIRED THE ASSISTANCE OF A HAMMER THIS WAS A STATE OF THINGS NOT TO BE ENDURED I SOON GREW AS POOR AS A RAT AND HAVING A WIFE AND CHILDREN TO PROVIDE FOR MY BURDENS AT LENGTH BECAME INTOLERABLE
6373-65772-0038 AND I SPENT HOUR AFTER HOUR IN REFLECTING UPON THE MOST CONVENIENT METHOD OF PUTTING AN END TO MY LIFE DUNS IN THE MEANTIME LEFT ME LITTLE LEISURE FOR CONTEMPLATION
6373-65772-0039 MY HOUSE WAS LITERALLY BESIEGED FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT SO THAT I BEGAN TO RAVE AND FOAM AND FRET LIKE A CAGED TIGER AGAINST THE BARS OF HIS ENCLOSURE THERE WERE THREE FELLOWS IN PARTICULAR WHO WORRIED ME BEYOND ENDURANCE
6373-65772-0040 KEEPING WATCH CONTINUALLY ABOUT MY DOOR AND THREATENING ME WITH THE LAW UPON THESE THREE I INTERNALLY VOWED THE BITTEREST REVENGE IF EVER I SHOULD BE SO HAPPY AS TO GET THEM WITHIN MY CLUTCHES
6373-65772-0041 AND I BELIEVE NOTHING IN THE WORLD BUT THE PLEASURE OF THIS ANTICIPATION PREVENTED ME FROM PUTTING MY PLAN OF SUICIDE INTO IMMEDIATE EXECUTION BY BLOWING MY BRAINS OUT WITH A BLUNDERBUSS I THOUGHT IT BEST HOWEVER TO DISSEMBLE MY WRATH
6373-65772-0042 AND TO TREAT THEM WITH PROMISES AND FAIR WORDS UNTIL BY SOME GOOD TURN OF FATE AN OPPORTUNITY OF VENGEANCE SHOULD BE AFFORDED ME ONE DAY HAVING GIVEN MY CREDITORS THE SLIP AND FEELING MORE THAN USUALLY DEJECTED
6373-65772-0043 I CONTINUED FOR A LONG TIME TO WANDER ABOUT THE MOST OBSCURE STREETS WITHOUT OBJECT WHATEVER UNTIL AT LENGTH I CHANCED TO STUMBLE AGAINST THE CORNER OF A BOOKSELLER'S STALL SEEING A CHAIR CLOSE AT HAND FOR THE USE OF CUSTOMERS
6373-65772-0044 READING IT ACTUALLY THROUGH TWICE BEFORE I AWOKE TO A RECOLLECTION OF WHAT WAS PASSING AROUND ME BY THIS TIME IT BEGAN TO GROW DARK AND I DIRECTED MY STEPS TOWARD HOME BUT THE TREATISE HAD MADE AN INDELIBLE IMPRESSION ON MY MIND
6373-65772-0045 OR INDUCING ME TO MISTRUST THE MANY VAGUE NOTIONS WHICH HAD ARISEN IN CONSEQUENCE MERELY SERVED AS A FARTHER STIMULUS TO IMAGINATION AND I WAS VAIN ENOUGH OR PERHAPS REASONABLE ENOUGH TO DOUBT WHETHER THOSE CRUDE IDEAS WHICH
6373-65772-0046 PROFUNDITY ITSELF MIGHT NOT IN MATTERS OF A PURELY SPECULATIVE NATURE BE DETECTED AS A LEGITIMATE SOURCE OF FALSITY AND ERROR
6373-65772-0047 IN OTHER WORDS I BELIEVED AND STILL DO BELIEVE THAT TRUTH IS FREQUENTLY OF ITS OWN ESSENCE SUPERFICIAL AND THAT IN MANY CASES THE DEPTH LIES MORE IN THE ABYSSES WHERE WE SEEK HER
6373-65772-0048 THAN IN THE ACTUAL SITUATIONS WHEREIN SHE MAY BE FOUND NATURE HERSELF SEEMED TO AFFORD ME CORROBORATION OF THESE IDEAS IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES IT STRUCK ME FORCIBLY
6373-65772-0049 AND FORGOTTEN THE BELLOWS MENDER IN FAR DIFFERENT OCCUPATIONS BUT AT THE EPOCH OF WHICH I SPEAK THE ANALOGY WHICH A CASUAL OBSERVATION OF A STAR OFFERED TO THE CONCLUSIONS I HAD ALREADY DRAWN
6373-65772-0050 I REPAIRED EAGERLY TO THE BOOKSELLER'S STALL AND LAID OUT WHAT LITTLE READY MONEY I POSSESSED IN THE PURCHASE OF SOME VOLUMES OF MECHANICS AND PRACTICAL ASTRONOMY HAVING ARRIVED AT HOME SAFELY WITH THESE
6373-65772-0051 I DEVOTED EVERY SPARE MOMENT TO THEIR PERUSAL AND SOON MADE SUCH PROFICIENCY IN STUDIES OF THIS NATURE AS I THOUGHT SUFFICIENT FOR THE EXECUTION OF MY PLAN
6373-65772-0052 IN THE INTERVALS OF THIS PERIOD I MADE EVERY ENDEAVOR TO CONCILIATE THE THREE CREDITORS WHO HAD GIVEN ME SO MUCH ANNOYANCE IN THIS I FINALLY SUCCEEDED PARTLY BY SELLING ENOUGH OF MY HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE TO SATISFY A MOIETY OF THEIR CLAIM
6373-65772-0053 I FOUND LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN GAINING THEM OVER TO MY PURPOSE MATTERS BEING THUS ARRANGED I CONTRIVED BY THE AID OF MY WIFE AND WITH THE GREATEST SECRECY AND CAUTION TO DISPOSE OF WHAT PROPERTY I HAD REMAINING
6373-65772-0054 IN THE MEANTIME I WORKED UP THE TWINE INTO A NET WORK OF SUFFICIENT DIMENSIONS RIGGED IT WITH A HOOP AND THE NECESSARY CORDS BOUGHT A QUADRANT A COMPASS A SPY GLASS A COMMON BAROMETER WITH SOME IMPORTANT MODIFICATIONS
6373-65772-0055 FIVE IRON BOUND CASKS TO CONTAIN ABOUT FIFTY GALLONS EACH AND ONE OF A LARGER SIZE SIX TINNED WARE TUBES THREE INCHES IN DIAMETER PROPERLY SHAPED AND TEN FEET IN LENGTH A QUANTITY OF A PARTICULAR METALLIC SUBSTANCE
6373-65772-0056 OR AT LEAST NEVER APPLIED TO ANY SIMILAR PURPOSE THE SECRET I WOULD MAKE NO DIFFICULTY IN DISCLOSING BUT THAT IT OF RIGHT BELONGS TO A CITIZEN OF NANTZ IN FRANCE
6373-65772-0057 I FOUND IT HOWEVER ALTOGETHER TOO EXPENSIVE AND WAS NOT SURE UPON THE WHOLE WHETHER CAMBRIC MUSLIN WITH A COATING OF GUM CAOUTCHOUC WAS NOT EQUALLY AS GOOD
6373-65772-0058 ON THE SPOT WHICH I INTENDED EACH OF THE SMALLER CASKS TO OCCUPY RESPECTIVELY DURING THE INFLATION OF THE BALLOON I PRIVATELY DUG A HOLE TWO FEET DEEP THE HOLES FORMING IN THIS MANNER A CIRCLE TWENTY FIVE FEET IN DIAMETER
6373-65772-0059 IN THE CENTRE OF THIS CIRCLE BEING THE STATION DESIGNED FOR THE LARGE CASK I ALSO DUG A HOLE THREE FEET IN DEPTH IN EACH OF THE FIVE SMALLER HOLES I DEPOSITED A CANISTER CONTAINING FIFTY POUNDS
6373-65772-0060 THESE THE KEG AND CANISTERS I CONNECTED IN A PROPER MANNER WITH COVERED TRAINS AND HAVING LET INTO ONE OF THE CANISTERS THE END OF ABOUT FOUR FEET OF SLOW MATCH
6373-65772-0061 BESIDES THE ARTICLES ABOVE ENUMERATED I CONVEYED TO THE DEPOT AND THERE SECRETED ONE OF M GRIMM'S IMPROVEMENTS UPON THE APPARATUS FOR CONDENSATION OF THE ATMOSPHERIC AIR
6373-65772-0062 I FOUND THIS MACHINE HOWEVER TO REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE ALTERATION BEFORE IT COULD BE ADAPTED TO THE PURPOSES TO WHICH I INTENDED MAKING IT APPLICABLE
6373-65772-0063 BUT WITH SEVERE LABOR AND UNREMITTING PERSEVERANCE I AT LENGTH MET WITH ENTIRE SUCCESS IN ALL MY PREPARATIONS MY BALLOON WAS SOON COMPLETED IT WOULD CONTAIN MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND CUBIC FEET OF GAS
6373-65772-0064 IT HAD RECEIVED THREE COATS OF VARNISH AND I FOUND THE CAMBRIC MUSLIN TO ANSWER ALL THE PURPOSES OF SILK ITSELF QUITE AS STRONG AND A GOOD DEAL LESS EXPENSIVE
6373-65772-0065 EVERYTHING BEING NOW READY I EXACTED FROM MY WIFE AN OATH OF SECRECY IN RELATION TO ALL MY ACTIONS FROM THE DAY OF MY FIRST VISIT TO THE BOOKSELLER'S STALL AND PROMISING ON MY PART TO RETURN AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD PERMIT
6373-65772-0066 I GAVE HER WHAT LITTLE MONEY I HAD LEFT AND BADE HER FAREWELL INDEED I HAD NO FEAR ON HER ACCOUNT SHE WAS WHAT PEOPLE CALL A NOTABLE WOMAN AND COULD MANAGE MATTERS IN THE WORLD WITHOUT MY ASSISTANCE
6373-65772-0067 I BELIEVE TO TELL THE TRUTH SHE ALWAYS LOOKED UPON ME AS AN IDLE BOY A MERE MAKE WEIGHT GOOD FOR NOTHING BUT BUILDING CASTLES IN THE AIR AND WAS RATHER GLAD TO GET RID OF ME IT WAS A DARK NIGHT WHEN I BADE HER GOOD BYE
6373-65772-0068 WE THERE FOUND THEM ALL UNMOLESTED AND I PROCEEDED IMMEDIATELY TO BUSINESS IT WAS THE FIRST OF APRIL THE NIGHT AS I SAID BEFORE WAS DARK THERE WAS NOT A STAR TO BE SEEN AND A DRIZZLING RAIN FALLING AT INTERVALS
6373-65772-0069 RENDERED US VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BUT MY CHIEF ANXIETY WAS CONCERNING THE BALLOON WHICH IN SPITE OF THE VARNISH WITH WHICH IT WAS DEFENDED BEGAN TO GROW RATHER HEAVY WITH THE MOISTURE THE POWDER ALSO WAS LIABLE TO DAMAGE
6373-65772-0070 I THEREFORE KEPT MY THREE DUNS WORKING WITH GREAT DILIGENCE POUNDING DOWN ICE AROUND THE CENTRAL CASK AND STIRRING THE ACID IN THE OTHERS THEY DID NOT CEASE HOWEVER IMPORTUNING ME WITH QUESTIONS AS TO WHAT I INTENDED TO DO WITH ALL THIS APPARATUS
6373-65772-0071 AND EXPRESSED MUCH DISSATISFACTION AT THE TERRIBLE LABOR I MADE THEM UNDERGO THEY COULD NOT PERCEIVE SO THEY SAID WHAT GOOD WAS LIKELY TO RESULT FROM THEIR GETTING WET TO THE SKIN MERELY TO TAKE A PART IN SUCH HORRIBLE INCANTATIONS
6373-65772-0072 I BEGAN TO GET UNEASY AND WORKED AWAY WITH ALL MY MIGHT FOR I VERILY BELIEVE THE IDIOTS SUPPOSED THAT I HAD ENTERED INTO A COMPACT WITH THE DEVIL AND THAT IN SHORT WHAT I WAS NOW DOING WAS NOTHING BETTER THAN IT SHOULD BE
6373-65772-0073 I WAS THEREFORE IN GREAT FEAR OF THEIR LEAVING ME ALTOGETHER I CONTRIVED HOWEVER TO PACIFY THEM BY PROMISES OF PAYMENT OF ALL SCORES IN FULL AS SOON AS I COULD BRING THE PRESENT BUSINESS TO A TERMINATION
6373-65772-0074 TO THESE SPEECHES THEY GAVE OF COURSE THEIR OWN INTERPRETATION FANCYING NO DOUBT THAT AT ALL EVENTS I SHOULD COME INTO POSSESSION OF VAST QUANTITIES OF READY MONEY AND PROVIDED I PAID THEM ALL I OWED AND A TRIFLE MORE IN CONSIDERATION OF THEIR SERVICES
6373-65772-0075 I DARE SAY THEY CARED VERY LITTLE WHAT BECAME OF EITHER MY SOUL OR MY CARCASS IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS AND A HALF I FOUND THE BALLOON SUFFICIENTLY INFLATED I ATTACHED THE CAR THEREFORE AND PUT ALL MY IMPLEMENTS IN IT NOT FORGETTING THE CONDENSING APPARATUS
6373-65772-0076 A COPIOUS SUPPLY OF WATER AND A LARGE QUANTITY OF PROVISIONS SUCH AS PEMMICAN IN WHICH MUCH NUTRIMENT IS CONTAINED IN COMPARATIVELY LITTLE BULK I ALSO SECURED IN THE CAR A PAIR OF PIGEONS AND A CAT IT WAS NOW NEARLY DAYBREAK
6373-65772-0077 AND I THOUGHT IT HIGH TIME TO TAKE MY DEPARTURE DROPPING A LIGHTED CIGAR ON THE GROUND AS IF BY ACCIDENT I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY IN STOOPING TO PICK IT UP OF IGNITING PRIVATELY THE PIECE OF SLOW MATCH WHOSE END AS I SAID BEFORE
6373-65772-0078 PROTRUDED A VERY LITTLE BEYOND THE LOWER RIM OF ONE OF THE SMALLER CASKS THIS MANOEUVRE WAS TOTALLY UNPERCEIVED ON THE PART OF THE THREE DUNS AND JUMPING INTO THE CAR I IMMEDIATELY CUT THE SINGLE CORD WHICH HELD ME TO THE EARTH
6373-65772-0079 AND WAS PLEASED TO FIND THAT I SHOT UPWARD CARRYING WITH ALL EASE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE POUNDS OF LEADEN BALLAST AND ABLE TO HAVE CARRIED UP AS MANY MORE SCARCELY HOWEVER HAD I ATTAINED THE HEIGHT OF FIFTY YARDS
6373-65772-0080 WHEN ROARING AND RUMBLING UP AFTER ME IN THE MOST HORRIBLE AND TUMULTUOUS MANNER CAME SO DENSE A HURRICANE OF FIRE AND SMOKE AND SULPHUR AND LEGS AND ARMS AND GRAVEL AND BURNING WOOD AND
6373-65772-0081 BLAZING METAL THAT MY VERY HEART SUNK WITHIN ME AND I FELL DOWN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR TREMBLING WITH UNMITIGATED TERROR INDEED I NOW PERCEIVED THAT I HAD ENTIRELY OVERDONE THE BUSINESS
6373-65772-0082 MY SITUATION DIRECTLY ABOVE IT AND IN THE LINE OF ITS GREATEST POWER BUT AT THE TIME I THOUGHT ONLY OF PRESERVING MY LIFE THE BALLOON AT FIRST COLLAPSED THEN FURIOUSLY EXPANDED
6373-65772-0083 AND MY FACE OUTWARDS BY A PIECE OF SLENDER CORD ABOUT THREE FEET IN LENGTH WHICH HUNG ACCIDENTALLY THROUGH A CREVICE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE WICKER WORK AND IN WHICH AS I FELL
6373-65772-0084 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORM ANY ADEQUATE IDEA OF THE HORROR OF MY SITUATION I GASPED CONVULSIVELY FOR BREATH
6373-65772-0085 AND THE HORRIBLE BLACKNESS OF THE FINGERNAILS I AFTERWARD CAREFULLY EXAMINED MY HEAD SHAKING IT REPEATEDLY AND FEELING IT WITH MINUTE ATTENTION UNTIL I SUCCEEDED IN SATISFYING MYSELF THAT IT WAS NOT
6373-65772-0086 AND NOT BEING ABLE TO DO SO FELT INEXPRESSIBLY CHAGRINED IT NOW OCCURRED TO ME THAT I SUFFERED GREAT UNEASINESS IN THE JOINT OF MY LEFT ANKLE AND A DIM CONSCIOUSNESS OF MY SITUATION BEGAN TO GLIMMER THROUGH MY MIND
6373-65772-0087 BUT STRANGE TO SAY I WAS NEITHER ASTONISHED NOR HORROR STRICKEN IF I FELT ANY EMOTION AT ALL IT WAS A KIND OF CHUCKLING SATISFACTION AT THE CLEVERNESS I WAS ABOUT TO DISPLAY IN EXTRICATING MYSELF FROM THIS DILEMMA
6373-65772-0088 AND I NEVER FOR A MOMENT LOOKED UPON MY ULTIMATE SAFETY AS A QUESTION SUSCEPTIBLE OF DOUBT FOR A FEW MINUTES I REMAINED WRAPPED IN THE PROFOUNDEST MEDITATION
6373-65772-0089 I HAVE A DISTINCT RECOLLECTION OF FREQUENTLY COMPRESSING MY LIPS PUTTING MY FOREFINGER TO THE SIDE OF MY NOSE AND MAKING USE OF OTHER GESTICULATIONS AND GRIMACES COMMON TO MEN WHO AT EASE IN THEIR ARM CHAIRS
6373-65772-0090 MEDITATE UPON MATTERS OF INTRICACY OR IMPORTANCE HAVING AS I THOUGHT SUFFICIENTLY COLLECTED MY IDEAS I NOW WITH GREAT CAUTION AND DELIBERATION PUT MY HANDS BEHIND MY BACK
6373-65772-0091 DRAWING NOW MY BODY UPWARDS WITH A PRODIGIOUS EXERTION OF MUSCULAR FORCE I SUCCEEDED AT THE VERY FIRST TRIAL IN THROWING THE BUCKLE OVER THE CAR AND ENTANGLING IT AS I HAD ANTICIPATED IN THE CIRCULAR RIM OF THE WICKER WORK
6373-65772-0092 MY BODY WAS NOW INCLINED TOWARDS THE SIDE OF THE CAR AT AN ANGLE OF ABOUT FORTY FIVE DEGREES BUT IT MUST NOT BE UNDERSTOOD THAT I WAS THEREFORE ONLY FORTY FIVE DEGREES BELOW THE PERPENDICULAR SO FAR FROM IT
6373-65772-0093 I STILL LAY NEARLY LEVEL WITH THE PLANE OF THE HORIZON FOR THE CHANGE OF SITUATION WHICH I HAD ACQUIRED HAD FORCED THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR CONSIDERABLY OUTWARDS FROM MY POSITION WHICH WAS ACCORDINGLY ONE OF THE MOST IMMINENT AND DEADLY PERIL
6373-65772-0094 IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED HOWEVER THAT WHEN I FELL IN THE FIRST INSTANCE FROM THE CAR IF I HAD FALLEN WITH MY FACE TURNED TOWARD THE BALLOON INSTEAD OF TURNED OUTWARDLY FROM IT AS IT ACTUALLY WAS OR IF IN THE SECOND PLACE
6373-65772-0095 THE CORD BY WHICH I WAS SUSPENDED HAD CHANCED TO HANG OVER THE UPPER EDGE INSTEAD OF THROUGH A CREVICE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR I SAY IT MAY BE READILY CONCEIVED THAT IN EITHER OF THESE SUPPOSED CASES
6373-65772-0096 I SHOULD HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH EVEN AS MUCH AS I HAD NOW ACCOMPLISHED AND THE WONDERFUL ADVENTURES OF HANS PFAALL WOULD HAVE BEEN UTTERLY LOST TO POSTERITY I HAD THEREFORE
6373-65772-0097 AND HUNG FOR PERHAPS A QUARTER OF AN HOUR IN THAT EXTRAORDINARY MANNER WITHOUT MAKING THE SLIGHTEST FARTHER EXERTION WHATSOEVER AND IN A SINGULARLY TRANQUIL STATE OF IDIOTIC ENJOYMENT
6373-65772-0098 BUT THIS FEELING DID NOT FAIL TO DIE RAPIDLY AWAY AND THEREUNTO SUCCEEDED HORROR AND DISMAY AND A CHILLING SENSE OF UTTER HELPLESSNESS AND RUIN IN FACT
6373-65772-0099 THE BLOOD SO LONG ACCUMULATING IN THE VESSELS OF MY HEAD AND THROAT AND WHICH HAD HITHERTO BUOYED UP MY SPIRITS WITH MADNESS AND DELIRIUM HAD NOW BEGUN TO RETIRE WITHIN THEIR PROPER CHANNELS
6373-65772-0100 AND THE DISTINCTNESS WHICH WAS THUS ADDED TO MY PERCEPTION OF THE DANGER MERELY SERVED TO DEPRIVE ME OF THE SELF POSSESSION AND COURAGE TO ENCOUNTER IT BUT THIS WEAKNESS WAS LUCKILY FOR ME OF NO VERY LONG DURATION
6373-65772-0101 IN GOOD TIME CAME TO MY RESCUE THE SPIRIT OF DESPAIR AND WITH FRANTIC CRIES AND STRUGGLES I JERKED MY WAY BODILY UPWARDS TILL AT LENGTH CLUTCHING WITH A VISE LIKE GRIP THE LONG DESIRED RIM
6373-65772-0102 IT WAS NOT UNTIL SOME TIME AFTERWARD THAT I RECOVERED MYSELF SUFFICIENTLY TO ATTEND TO THE ORDINARY CARES OF THE BALLOON I THEN HOWEVER EXAMINED IT WITH ATTENTION AND FOUND IT TO MY GREAT RELIEF UNINJURED
6373-65772-0103 MY IMPLEMENTS WERE ALL SAFE AND FORTUNATELY I HAD LOST NEITHER BALLAST NOR PROVISIONS INDEED I HAD SO WELL SECURED THEM IN THEIR PLACES THAT SUCH AN ACCIDENT WAS ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION
6373-65772-0104 LOOKING AT MY WATCH I FOUND IT SIX O'CLOCK I WAS STILL RAPIDLY ASCENDING AND MY BAROMETER GAVE A PRESENT ALTITUDE OF THREE AND THREE QUARTER MILES IMMEDIATELY BENEATH ME IN THE OCEAN LAY A SMALL BLACK OBJECT
6373-65772-0105 SLIGHTLY OBLONG IN SHAPE SEEMINGLY ABOUT THE SIZE AND IN EVERY WAY BEARING A GREAT RESEMBLANCE TO ONE OF THOSE CHILDISH TOYS CALLED A DOMINO
6373-65772-0106 BRINGING MY TELESCOPE TO BEAR UPON IT I PLAINLY DISCERNED IT TO BE A BRITISH NINETY FOUR GUN SHIP CLOSE HAULED AND PITCHING HEAVILY IN THE SEA
6373-65772-0107 IT IS NOW HIGH TIME THAT I SHOULD EXPLAIN TO YOUR EXCELLENCIES THE OBJECT OF MY PERILOUS VOYAGE YOUR EXCELLENCIES WILL BEAR IN MIND THAT DISTRESSED CIRCUMSTANCES IN ROTTERDAM HAD AT LENGTH DRIVEN ME TO THE RESOLUTION OF COMMITTING SUICIDE
6373-65772-0108 IT WAS NOT HOWEVER THAT TO LIFE ITSELF I HAD ANY POSITIVE DISGUST BUT THAT I WAS HARASSED BEYOND ENDURANCE BY THE ADVENTITIOUS MISERIES ATTENDING MY SITUATION IN THIS STATE OF MIND WISHING TO LIVE
6373-65772-0109 YET WEARIED WITH LIFE THE TREATISE AT THE STALL OF THE BOOKSELLER OPENED A RESOURCE TO MY IMAGINATION I THEN FINALLY MADE UP MY MIND I DETERMINED TO DEPART YET LIVE TO LEAVE THE WORLD YET CONTINUE TO EXIST
6373-65772-0110 IN SHORT TO DROP ENIGMAS I RESOLVED LET WHAT WOULD ENSUE TO FORCE A PASSAGE IF I COULD TO THE MOON
