5756-80689-0000 EVEN IF WE FIND IT THIS EVENING THE HUNDRED DAYS WILL BE OVER IN AN HOUR AND LONG BEFORE WE COULD REACH THE EGYPTIAN CAPITAL THE DOCTOR WILL BE ON HIS WAY HOME STILL I WILL GO OUT AGAIN AND CAST THE NET ONCE MORE MYSELF
5756-80689-0001 IT IS TOO LATE MURMURED THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD STUDIED IN THE SCHOOLS OF PHILOSOPHY BUT ALL THE SAME PUT THE FISH IN THAT VESSEL FULL OF WATER AND WE WILL TAKE IT BACK TO SHOW MY FATHER THAT WE HAVE DONE WHAT WE COULD BUT WHEN HE DREW NEAR THE FISH IT LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH SUCH PITEOUS EYES
5756-80689-0002 THAT HE COULD NOT MAKE UP HIS MIND TO CONDEMN IT TO DEATH FOR HE KNEW WELL THAT
5756-80689-0003 AND THREW IT BACK INTO THE SEA AND THEN BEGAN HIS JOURNEY BACK TO THE PALACE WHEN AT LAST HE REACHED IT HE FOUND THE KING IN A HIGH FEVER CAUSED BY HIS DISAPPOINTMENT AND HE REFUSED TO BELIEVE THE STORY TOLD HIM BY HIS SON YOUR HEAD SHALL PAY FOR IT
5756-80689-0004 YOUR HEAD SHALL PAY FOR IT CRIED HE
5756-80689-0005 BUT OF COURSE SOMEBODY RAN AT ONCE TO THE QUEEN AND TOLD HER OF THE KING'S ORDER AND SHE PUT COMMON CLOTHES ON THE PRINCE AND FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH GOLD AND HURRIED HIM ON BOARD A SHIP WHICH WAS SAILING THAT NIGHT FOR A DISTANT ISLAND YOUR FATHER WILL REPENT SOME DAY
5756-80689-0006 AND THEN HE WILL BE THANKFUL TO KNOW YOU ARE ALIVE SAID SHE
5756-80689-0007 AND THAT IS TAKE NO MAN INTO YOUR SERVICE WHO DESIRES TO BE PAID EVERY MONTH THE YOUNG PRINCE THOUGHT THIS ADVICE RATHER ODD IF THE SERVANT HAD TO BE PAID ANYHOW
5756-80689-0008 HE HAD MANY TIMES PROVED THAT HIS MOTHER WAS WISER THAN HE SO HE PROMISED OBEDIENCE AFTER A VOYAGE OF SEVERAL WEEKS HE ARRIVED AT THE ISLAND OF WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD SPOKEN IT WAS FULL OF HILLS AND WOODS AND FLOWERS AND BEAUTIFUL WHITE HOUSES STOOD EVERYWHERE IN GARDENS
5756-80689-0009 WHAT A CHARMING SPOT TO LIVE IN THOUGHT THE PRINCE AND HE LOST NO TIME IN BUYING ONE OF THE PRETTIEST OF THE DWELLINGS THEN SERVANTS CAME PRESSING TO OFFER THEIR SERVICES
5756-80689-0010 AND WHAT WAGES DO YOU ASK INQUIRED THE PRINCE WHEN HE HAD QUESTIONED THE NEW COMER AND FOUND HIM SUITABLE
5756-80689-0011 AT THE END OF A YEAR YOU CAN SEE WHAT MY SERVICES ARE WORTH TO YOU AND CAN PAY ME IN ANY WAY YOU LIKE
5756-80689-0012 THE OTHER PART WAS A COMPLETE DESERT
5756-80689-0013 THE GOVERNOR HAD SENT BANDS OF SOLDIERS TO LIE IN WAIT FOR THE CREATURE IN ORDER TO KILL IT
5756-80689-0014 THAT THE RAVAGES WERE COMMITTED IT WAS IN VAIN THAT THE SLEEPY SOLDIERS WERE ALWAYS PUNISHED SEVERELY THE SAME THING INVARIABLY OCCURRED NEXT TIME AND AT LAST HERALDS
5756-80689-0015 ASKED HE MY DAUGHTER AND ANYTHING BESIDES THAT HE CHOOSES ANSWERED THE GOVERNOR BUT THE ARAB SHOOK HIS HEAD GIVE HIM YOUR DAUGHTER AND KEEP YOUR WEALTH SAID HE BUT HENCEFORWARD LET HER SHARE IN YOUR GAINS WHATEVER THEY ARE
5756-80689-0016 THAT NIGHT THE ARAB STOLE DOWN TO THE SHORE TO WATCH BUT BEFORE HE SET OUT HE RUBBED HIMSELF ALL OVER WITH SOME OIL WHICH MADE HIS SKIN SMART SO BADLY THAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIS GOING TO SLEEP AS THE SOLDIERS HAD DONE THEN HE HID HIMSELF BEHIND A LARGE ROCK AND WAITED
5756-80689-0017 BY AND BY A SWELL SEEMED TO RISE ON THE WATER AND A FEW MINUTES LATER A HIDEOUS MONSTER PART BIRD PART BEAST AND PART SERPENT STEPPED NOISELESSLY
5756-80689-0018 IT WALKED STEALTHILY UP TOWARDS THE FIELDS BUT THE ARAB WAS READY FOR IT AND AS IT PASSED PLUNGED HIS DAGGER INTO THE SOFT PART BEHIND THE EAR THE CREATURE STAGGERED AND GAVE A LOUD CRY AND THEN ROLLED OVER DEAD WITH ITS FEET IN THE SEA
5756-80689-0019 BUT AS THE HUGE BODY REMAINED QUITE STILL HE QUITTED HIS HIDING PLACE AND CUT OFF THE EARS OF HIS FOE
5756-80689-0020 NEVER MIND DO AS I BID YOU I HAVE A REASON FOR IT ANSWERED THE ARAB
5756-80689-0021 ALL HE DESIRED WAS A SHIP WHICH WOULD CARRY HIM TO SEE THE WORLD OF COURSE THIS WAS GRANTED HIM AT ONCE AND WHEN HE AND HIS FAITHFUL ARAB EMBARKED THEY FOUND HEAPED UP IN THE VESSEL STORES OF DIAMONDS AND PRECIOUS STONES
5756-80689-0022 SO THEY SAILED AND THEY SAILED AND THEY SAILED AND AT LENGTH
5756-80689-0023 AFTER SOME HOURS HE RETURNED SAYING THAT HE HEARD THAT THE KING'S DAUGHTER WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS IN THE WORLD AND THAT THE PRINCE WOULD DO WELL TO ASK FOR HER HAND NOTHING LOTH THE PRINCE LISTENED TO THIS ADVICE
5756-80689-0024 THE STRANGE KING HAPPENED TO BE IN A GOOD HUMOUR AND THEY WERE READILY ADMITTED TO HIS PRESENCE LAYING DOWN HIS OFFERINGS ON THE STEPS OF THE THRONE HE PRAYED THE KING TO GRANT HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE THE MONARCH LISTENED TO HIM IN SILENCE BUT ANSWERED AFTER A PAUSE
5756-80689-0025 AND NOT ONE OF THEM LIVED FOR TWELVE HOURS AFTER
5756-80689-0026 BUT JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO WITHDRAW HIS PROPOSAL THE ARAB WHISPERED FEAR NOTHING BUT TAKE HER THE LUCK MUST CHANGE SOME TIME HE SAID AT LAST
5756-80689-0027 AS YOU WILL REPLIED THE KING
5756-80689-0028 RETIRED TO THEIR OWN APARTMENTS TO SUP BY THEMSELVES FOR SUCH WAS THE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY
5756-80689-0029 TO LOOK OUT UPON THE RIVER AND UPON THE DISTANT HILLS WHEN HIS GAZE SUDDENLY FELL ON A SILKEN SHROUD NEATLY LAID OUT ON A COUCH WITH HIS NAME EMBROIDERED IN GOLD THREAD ACROSS THE FRONT FOR THIS ALSO WAS THE PLEASURE OF THE KING
5756-80689-0030 HORRIFIED AT THE SPECTACLE HE TURNED HIS HEAD AWAY AND THIS TIME
5756-80689-0031 IT WAS A CURIOUS SHAPE SO LONG AND NARROW ALMOST LIKE
5756-80689-0032 AT THIS MOMENT A SMALL BLACK SNAKE
5756-80689-0033 AND SEIZING THE SERPENT WITH SOME PINCERS THAT HE HELD IN ONE HAND HE CUT OFF ITS HEAD WITH A SHARP DAGGER THE KING COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HIS EYES WHEN EARLY THE NEXT MORNING HIS NEW SON IN LAW CRAVED AN AUDIENCE OF HIS MAJESTY WHAT YOU
5756-80689-0034 HE CRIED AS THE YOUNG MAN ENTERED
5756-80689-0035 YOU REMEMBER I TOLD YOU THAT THE LUCK MUST TURN AT LAST AND SO IT HAS
5756-80689-0036 NOW FROM THE MOMENT THAT THE ARAB CUT OFF THE SNAKE'S HEAD THE SPELL OR WHATEVER IT WAS SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF THE PRINCESS AND SHE LIVED VERY HAPPILY WITH HER HUSBAND THE DAYS PASSED SWIFTLY IN HUNTING IN THE FORESTS OR SAILING ON THE BROAD RIVER THAT FLOWED PAST THE PALACE
5756-80689-0037 AND WHEN NIGHT FELL SHE WOULD SING TO HER HARP OR THE PRINCE WOULD TELL HER TALES OF HIS OWN COUNTRY ONE EVENING A MAN IN A STRANGE GARB WITH A FACE BURNT BROWN BY THE SUN ARRIVED AT COURT HE ASKED TO SEE THE BRIDEGROOM AND FALLING ON HIS FACE ANNOUNCED
5756-80689-0038 THAT HE WAS A MESSENGER SENT BY THE QUEEN OF EGYPT PROCLAIMING HIM KING IN SUCCESSION TO HIS FATHER WHO WAS DEAD HER MAJESTY BEGS YOU WILL SET OUT WITHOUT DELAY
5756-80689-0039 THAT HIS DAUGHTER'S HUSBAND WAS NOT MERELY THE GOVERNOR OF A PROVINCE AS HE HAD SUPPOSED BUT THE KING OF A POWERFUL COUNTRY HE AT ONCE ORDERED A SPLENDID SHIP TO BE MADE READY
5756-80689-0040 TO BID FAREWELL TO THE YOUNG COUPLE IN SPITE OF HER GRIEF FOR THE DEAD KING THE QUEEN WAS OVERJOYED TO WELCOME HER SON HOME AND COMMANDED THE PALACE TO BE HUNG WITH SPLENDID STUFFS TO DO HONOUR TO THE BRIDE THE PEOPLE EXPECTED GREAT THINGS FROM THEIR NEW SOVEREIGN
5756-80689-0041 AND CROWDS PRESENTED THEMSELVES EVERY MORNING WITH PETITIONS IN THEIR HANDS
5756-80689-0042 BUT HE WAS VERY HAPPY FOR ALL THAT TILL ONE NIGHT THE ARAB CAME TO HIM AND BEGGED PERMISSION TO RETURN TO HIS OWN LAND FILLED WITH DISMAY THE YOUNG MAN SAID
5756-80689-0043 SADLY THE ARAB BOWED HIS HEAD NO MY MASTER
5756-80689-0044 BUT I HAVE RECEIVED A SUMMONS AND I DARE NOT DISOBEY IT THE KING WAS SILENT TRYING TO CHOKE DOWN THE GRIEF HE FELT AT THE THOUGHT OF LOSING HIS FAITHFUL SERVANT WELL
5756-80689-0045 THAT WOULD BE A POOR RETURN FOR ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME EVERYTHING I HAVE IS YOURS TAKE WHAT YOU WILL FOR WITHOUT YOU I SHOULD LONG AGO HAVE BEEN DEAD AND WITHOUT YOU I SHOULD LONG AGO HAVE BEEN DEAD ANSWERED THE ARAB I AM THE GOLDEN HEADED FISH
