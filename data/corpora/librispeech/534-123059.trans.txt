534-123059-0004 IT WAS NOT THE DEAD TIREDNESS THAT COMES THROUGH BRIEF AND EXCESSIVE EFFORT FROM WHICH RECOVERY IS A MATTER OF HOURS BUT IT WAS THE DEAD TIREDNESS THAT COMES THROUGH THE SLOW AND PROLONGED STRENGTH DRAINAGE OF MONTHS OF TOIL

534-123059-0006 BIT OF IT EVERY MUSCLE EVERY FIBRE EVERY CELL WAS TIRED DEAD TIRED AND THERE WAS REASON FOR IT IN LESS THAN FIVE MONTHS THEY HAD TRAVELLED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED MILES
