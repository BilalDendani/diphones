6102-56170-0000 IT WAS A WINDY DAY IN EARLY JANUARY
6102-56170-0001 AS SHE WAS SLIPPING ALONG DOWN BEACON STREET ON HER WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL
6102-56170-0002 ONE HAND WAS KEPT IN CONSTANT USE HOLDING DOWN THE BRIM OF HER HAT
6102-56170-0003 ANOTHER GUST AND I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO COMPOSE A NEW POEM TO TAKE THE PLACE
6102-56170-0004 SHE HAD BEGUN TO SAY LOOKING UP IN HIS FACE THEN SUDDENLY SHE GAVE A START SURELY SHE HAD SEEN THAT FACE BEFORE BUT WHERE
6102-56170-0005 YET ALMOST IN A SHORTER TIME THAN I HAVE TAKEN TO TELL IT SHE RECOGNIZED THE OWNER OF THE PAPERS HE WAS CERTAINLY NO OTHER THAN DOCTOR OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES THE FAMOUS AUTOCRAT OF THE BREAKFAST TABLE
6102-56170-0006 SEVERAL OF WHOSE POEMS SHE KNEW ALMOST BY HEART ALL HER OLD SHYNESS CAME BACK TO HER SHE DID NOT EXACTLY DARE TO SAY THAT SHE RECOGNIZED HIM
6102-56170-0007 WERE WERE THEY SOME OF YOUR OWN POEMS SHE MANAGED TO STAMMER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DREADFUL IF THEY HAD BEEN LOST NOT HALF AS DREADFUL HE REPLIED SMILING AS IF THEY HAD BEEN WRITTEN BY SOME ONE ELSE
6102-56170-0008 AS A MATTER OF FACT THESE WERE SENT ME BY AN UNFLEDGED POET WHO WISHED ME TO TELL HIM WHETHER HE WOULD STAND A CHANCE
6102-56170-0009 HE TOLD ME TO TAKE GREAT CARE OF THEM AS HE HAD NO COPY
6102-56170-0010 THE POET OF COURSE DID NOT SPEAK TO JULIA IN PRECISELY THESE WORDS BUT THIS WAS THE DRIFT OF WHAT HE SAID AND IT WAS IN ABOUT THIS FORM THAT SHE REPEATED IT TO HER AUNT AND BRENDA AT THE LUNCHEON TABLE WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY
6102-56170-0011 HER AUNT HAD ASKED WITH GREAT INTEREST OH HE THANKED ME AGAIN FOR PICKING UP THE PAPERS COMPLIMENTED ME FOR BEING SO SURE FOOTED ON SUCH A SLIPPERY SIDEWALK
6102-56170-0012 WHEN HE HEARD THAT I HAD NOT LONG BEEN IN BOSTON HE ASKED ME TO CALL SOME AFTERNOON TO SEE HIM HE IS ALWAYS AT HOME AFTER FOUR I WALKED ALONG UNTIL HE REACHED HIS DOOR STEP
6102-56170-0013 HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE BRENDA NO SAID BRENDA SHAKING HER HEAD I DID NOT EXACTLY NOTICE WHOM YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WHY
6102-56170-0014 OH SAID BRENDA WITH A STARE THAT SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT THIS NAME DID NOT MEAN MUCH TO HER WHY YOU KNOW BRENDA OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES PROMPTED HER MOTHER AND STILL BRENDA LOOKED RATHER BLANK BRENDA
6102-56170-0015 SAID MISSUS BARLOW I AM SURPRISED SURELY YOU REMEMBER HOW PLEASED YOU WERE WITH THE LAST LEAF
6102-56170-0016 I DARE SAY ANSWERED BRENDA CARELESSLY BUT I HAD FORGOTTEN I DON'T SEE WHY JULIA SHOULD BE SO EXCITED ABOUT MEETING A POET THERE MUST BE EVER SO MANY OF THEM EVERYWHERE
6102-56170-0017 RESPONDED HER MOTHER I DO WISH THAT YOU WOULD TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THE AFFAIRS OF YOUR OWN CITY HERE IS JULIA WHO HAS BEEN IN BOSTON BUT A SHORT TIME
6102-56170-0018 THAN YOU WHO HAVE LIVED HERE ALL YOUR LIFE FOR A WONDER BRENDA DID NOT LAUGH AT WHAT HER MOTHER SAID NOR TAKE OFFENCE
6102-56170-0019 SO WHEN JULIA ASKED HER ONE AFTERNOON IF SHE WOULD NOT LIKE TO GO WITH HER TO CALL ON DOCTOR HOLMES SHE DECLINED WITH THANKS AND LEFT JULIA FREE TO INVITE EDITH
6102-56170-0020 IT SEEMED TO BE MERELY A RECEPTION ROOM
6102-56170-0021 AND LARGE FLOWERED YELLOW PAPER THERE WAS A CARVED TABLE IN THE CENTRE WITH WRITING MATERIALS AND INK STAND AND LITTLE OTHER FURNITURE BESIDES A FEW HANDSOME CHAIRS TALL BOOKCASES MATCHING THE WOODWORK OCCUPIED THE RECESSES AND THEY WERE FILLED WITH BOOKS IN SUBSTANTIAL BINDINGS
6102-56170-0022 IN A MOMENT THE MAID HAD RETURNED AND ASKED THEM TO FOLLOW HER AT THE HEAD OF THE BROAD STAIRS THEY SAW THE POET HIMSELF STANDING TO MEET THEM WITH OUTSTRETCHED HAND WHEN JULIA MENTIONED EDITH'S NAME AH
6102-56170-0023 THAT IS A GOOD OLD BOSTON NAME AND IF I MISTAKE NOT I USED TO KNOW YOUR GRANDFATHER AND THEN WHEN EDITH HAD SATISFIED HIM ON THIS POINT HE TURNED TO JULIA AND IN A BANTERING WAY SPOKE OF THE SERVICE SHE HAD DONE HIM THAT WINDY DAY
6102-56170-0024 THEY MAKE A PRETTY FAIR SHOWING FOR ONE MAN BUT MY PUBLISHERS ARE GETTING READY TO BRING OUT A COMPLETE EDITION OF MY WORKS AND THAT WELL THAT MAKES ME REALIZE MY AGE AFTER A MOMENT AS IF REFLECTING HE ASKED QUICKLY
6102-56170-0025 DOES EITHER OF YOU WRITE POETRY OH NO SIR ANSWERED EDITH QUICKLY WE COULDN'T WHY IT ISN'T SO VERY HARD HE SAID
6102-56170-0026 AT LEAST I SHOULD JUDGE NOT BY THE NUMBERS OF COPIES OF VERSES THAT ARE SENT TO ME TO EXAMINE POETRY DEALS WITH COMMON HUMAN EMOTION
6102-56170-0027 IT DEPENDS I SUPPOSE SAID EDITH SHYLY ON WHOSE WORK IT IS I AM AFRAID REPLIED THE POET THAT THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE STANDARD FOR VERSE MAKERS
6102-56170-0028 IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THAT THE WRITER OF VERSE IS ALMOST IN THE POSITION OF A MAN WHO MAKES A MOLD FOR A PLASTER CAST OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND
6102-56170-0029 AND FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW IT IS SURE TO FIT THOUGH EDITH MAY NOT HAVE GRASPED THE FULL FORCE OF THE POET'S MEANING
6102-56170-0030 SHE ASKED EVERY MAIL HE ANSWERED BRINGS ME LETTERS FROM STRANGERS FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE GLOBE SOME CONTAIN POEMS IN MY HONOR AS SPECIMENS OF WHAT THE POET CAN DO
6102-56170-0031 OTHERS ARE ACCOMPANIED BY LONG MANUSCRIPTS ON WHICH MY OPINION IS ASKED
6102-56170-0032 FOR PUBLISHERS HAVE A WAY OF QUOTING VERY UNFAIRLY IN THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS
6102-56170-0033 THE PUBLISHER QUOTES MERELY VERY CHARMING AND PRINTS THIS IN LARGE TYPE BOTH GIRLS SMILED AT THE EXPRESSION OF DROLL SORROW THAT CAME OVER THE POET'S FACE AS HE SPOKE AND I AM SO VERY UNFORTUNATE MYSELF HE ADDED
6102-56170-0034 WHEN I TRY TO GET AN AUTOGRAPH OF ANY CONSEQUENCE
6102-56170-0035 HE WROTE HIS THANKS ON A POSTCARD
6102-56170-0036 PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ME READ SOMETHING
6102-56170-0037 AND TAKING A VOLUME FROM THE TABLE HE BEGAN IN A VOICE THAT WAS A TRIFLE HUSKY THOUGH FULL OF EXPRESSION
6102-56170-0038 SAILS THE UNSHADOWED MAIN THE VENTUROUS BARK THAT FLINGS ON THE SWEET SUMMER WIND ITS VENTUROUS WINGS IN GULFS ENCHANTED WHERE THE SIREN SINGS
6102-56170-0039 AND CORAL REEFS LIE BARE WHERE THE COLD SEA MAIDS RAISE
6102-56170-0040 THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS
6102-56170-0041 SHE ANSWERED THEN WITH A SMILE OF APPRECIATION ADJUSTING HIS GLASSES DOCTOR HOLMES READ TO THE END OF THE POEM IN HIS WONDERFULLY MUSICAL VOICE
6102-56170-0042 NOW I WISH TO SHOW YOU MY FAVORITE VIEW
6102-56170-0043 IT WAS MUCH THE SAME VIEW TO WHICH JULIA WAS ACCUSTOMED IN HER UNCLE'S HOUSE AND YET
6102-56170-0044 SEVEN OR EIGHT IN NUMBER WHICH HE COULD SEE FROM THAT WINDOW SOMERVILLE MEDFORD BELMONT ARLINGTON CHARLESTOWN BROOKLINE AND ONE OR TWO OTHERS PERHAPS
6102-56170-0045 BESIDES CAMBRIDGE WITH ITS SPIRES AND CHIMNEYS IN WINTER SAID DOCTOR HOLMES THERE IS NOT MUCH TO SEE BESIDES THE TUG BOATS AND THE GULLS BUT
6102-56170-0046 BUT WHAT IT WAS HE DID NOT SAY FOR AS EDITH TURNED HER EYES TOWARD AN OIL PAINTING ON THE WALL NEAR BY HE SAID
6102-56170-0047 NOW LOOK AT THE PORTRAIT CLOSELY AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF THAT CHEEK
6102-56170-0048 WHEN BOTH GIRLS ADMITTED THAT THEY COULD NOT SEE THE SCAR
6102-56170-0049 THAT ONLY SHOWS HE SAID HOW CLEVER THE MAN WAS WHO MADE THE REPAIRS BEFORE THEY TURNED FROM THE WINDOW HE MADE THEM NOTICE THE TALL FACTORY CHIMNEYS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER WHICH HE CALLED HIS THERMOMETERS
6102-56170-0050 BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE SMOKE CURLED UPWARDS HE WAS ABLE TO TELL HOW THE WIND BLEW AND DECIDE IN WHAT DIRECTION HE SHOULD WALK
6102-56170-0051 YET DURING THEIR CALL HOW MANY THINGS THEY HAD TO SEE AND TO REMEMBER HE LET EACH OF THEM HOLD FOR A MOMENT THE GOLD PEN WITH WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN ELSIE VENNER AND THE AUTOCRAT PAPERS
6102-56170-0052 DOCTOR HOLMES CALLED THEIR ATTENTION TO THE BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE HANGING ON ONE WALL DONE IN FINE NEEDLEWORK BY THE HANDS OF HIS ACCOMPLISHED DAUGHTER IN LAW AND HE TOLD THEM A STORY OR TWO CONNECTED WITH ANOTHER PICTURE IN THE ROOM
6102-56170-0053 ALL SO SIMPLE AND YET SO DIGNIFIED
6102-56170-0054 EXCLAIMED EDITH ALMOST BREATHLESSLY
6102-56170-0055 EDITH GAVE JULIA A LITTLE NUDGE THEY WERE BOTH AT THE AGE WHEN THE POSSESSION OF AN AUTOGRAPH OF A FAMOUS MAN IS SOMETHING TO BE ARDENTLY DESIRED BUT NEITHER OF THEM HAD QUITE DARED TO ASK DOCTOR HOLMES FOR HIS
6102-56170-0056 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HE SAW THE LITTLE NUDGE OR PERHAPS HE READ THE EAGER EXPRESSION ON THEIR FACES FOR ALMOST BEFORE THEY REALIZED IT HE HAD PLACED IN THE HAND OF EACH OF THEM A SMALL VOLUME IN A WHITE COVER AND BIDDING THEM OPEN THEIR BOOKS HE SAID WELL I MUST PUT SOMETHING ON
6102-56170-0057 THAT BARE FLY LEAF SO SEATING HIMSELF AT HIS TABLE WITH A QUILL PEN IN HIS HAND HE WROTE SLOWLY AND EVIDENTLY WITH SOME EFFORT THE NAME OF EACH OF THEM FOLLOWED BY THE WORDS WITH THE REGARDS OF OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES
6102-56170-0058 AS HE HANDED THEM THE BOOKS HE OPENED THE DOOR AND WITH A WORD OR TWO MORE OF HALF BANTERING THANKS TO JULIA FOR HER ASSISTANCE ON THAT WINDY DAY HE BOWED THEM DOWN THE STAIRS SO IMPRESSED WERE THEY BY THE VISIT THAT THEY HAD LITTLE TO SAY UNTIL THEY REACHED HOME
6102-56170-0059 WHERE THEY FOUND MISSUS BARLOW A VERY SYMPATHETIC LISTENER
6102-56170-0060 WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE TAKEN ME TOO
6102-56170-0061 THEY ALL LAUGHED AT THIS A PROCEEDING WHICH THIS TIME DID NOT ANNOY BRENDA MISSUS BARLOW ADMIRED THE LITTLE BOOKS
