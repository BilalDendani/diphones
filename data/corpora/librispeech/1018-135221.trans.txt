1018-135221-0000 ALL THE EVENTFUL SCENES OF THE PAST AND THESE WERE ALL INTERMINGLED IN THE WILDEST CONFUSION THE CANNIBALS BECKONED TO US FROM THE PEAK AND WE LANDED BETWEEN THE TWO VOLCANOES THERE THE BODY OF THE DEAD SAILOR RECEIVED US AND AFTERWARD CHASED US TO THE BOAT
1018-135221-0001 THEN CAME SNOW AND VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS AND WE DRIFTED AMID ICEBERGS AND MOLTEN LAVA UNTIL WE ENTERED AN IRON PORTAL AND PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS HERE THERE WERE VAST SWIMMING MONSTERS AND BURNING ORBS OF FIRE AND THUNDEROUS CATARACTS
1018-135221-0002 FALLING FROM INCONCEIVABLE HEIGHTS AND THE SWEEP OF IMMEASURABLE TIDES AND THE CIRCLING OF INFINITE WHIRLPOOLS WHILE IN MY EARS THERE RANG THE NEVER ENDING ROAR OF REMORSELESS WATERS THAT CAME AFTER US WITH ALL THEIR WAVES AND BILLOWS ROLLING UPON US
1018-135221-0003 IT WAS A DREAM IN WHICH ALL THE MATERIAL TERRORS OF THE PAST WERE RENEWED BUT THESE WERE ALL AS NOTHING WHEN COMPARED WITH A CERTAIN DEEP UNDERLYING FEELING THAT POSSESSED MY SOUL A SENSE OF LOSS IRRETRIEVABLE AN EXPECTATION OF IMPENDING DOOM
1018-135221-0004 IN THE MIDST OF THIS I AWOKE IT WAS WITH A SUDDEN START AND I LOOKED ALL AROUND IN SPEECHLESS BEWILDERMENT THE FIRST THING OF WHICH I WAS CONSCIOUS WAS A GREAT BLAZE OF LIGHT LIGHT SO LATELY LOST AND SUPPOSED TO BE LOST FOREVER
1018-135221-0005 BUT NOW FILLING ALL THE UNIVERSE BRIGHT BRILLIANT GLOWING BRINGING HOPE AND JOY AND GLADNESS WITH ALL THE SPLENDOR OF DEEP BLUE SKIES AND THE MULTITUDINOUS LAUGHTER OF OCEAN WAVES THAT DANCED AND SPARKLED IN THE SUN
1018-135221-0006 I FLUNG UP MY ARMS AND LAUGHED ALOUD THEN I BURST INTO TEARS AND FALLING ON MY KNEES I THANKED THE ALMIGHTY RULER OF THE SKIES FOR THIS MARVELLOUS DELIVERANCE RISING FROM MY KNEES I LOOKED AROUND AND ONCE MORE AMAZEMENT OVERWHELMED ME
1018-135221-0007 I SAW A LONG LINE OF MOUNTAINS TOWERING UP TO IMMEASURABLE HEIGHTS THEIR SUMMITS COVERED WITH ETERNAL ICE AND SNOW THERE THE SUN BLAZED LOW IN THE SKY ELEVATED BUT A FEW DEGREES ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN CRESTS
1018-135221-0008 WHICH GLEAMED IN GOLD AND PURPLE UNDER ITS FIERY RAYS THE SUN SEEMED ENLARGED TO UNUSUAL DIMENSIONS AND THE MOUNTAINS RAN AWAY ON EVERY SIDE LIKE THE SEGMENT OF SOME INFINITE CIRCLE
1018-135221-0009 WHICH RAN UP THE SIDES OF THE MOUNTAINS TILL THEY REACHED THE LIMITS OF VEGETATION AND THE REGIONS OF SNOW AND ICE HERE IN ALL DIRECTIONS THERE WERE UNMISTAKABLE SIGNS OF HUMAN LIFE THE OUTLINES OF POPULOUS CITIES AND BUSY TOWNS AND HAMLETS
1018-135221-0010 ROADS WINDING FAR AWAY ALONG THE PLAIN OR UP THE MOUNTAIN SIDES AND MIGHTY WORKS OF INDUSTRY IN THE SHAPE OF MASSIVE STRUCTURES TERRACED SLOPES LONG ROWS OF ARCHES PONDEROUS PYRAMIDS AND BATTLEMENTED WALLS
1018-135221-0011 FROM THE LAND I TURNED TO THE SEA I SAW BEFORE ME AN EXPANSE OF WATER INTENSELY BLUE AN EXTENT SO VAST THAT NEVER BEFORE IN ALL MY OCEAN VOYAGES HAD ANYTHING APPEARED AT ALL COMPARABLE WITH IT
1018-135221-0012 OUT AT SEA WHEREVER I HAD BEEN THE WATER HAD ALWAYS LIMITED THE VIEW THE HORIZON HAD NEVER SEEMED FAR AWAY SHIPS SOON SANK BELOW IT AND THE VISIBLE SURFACE OF THE EARTH WAS THUS ALWAYS CONTRACTED BUT HERE TO MY BEWILDERMENT
1018-135221-0013 THE HORIZON APPEARED TO BE REMOVED TO AN IMMEASURABLE DISTANCE AND RAISED HIGH IN THE AIR WHILE THE WATERS WERE PROLONGED ENDLESSLY STARTING FROM WHERE I WAS THEY WENT AWAY TO INCONCEIVABLE DISTANCES
1018-135221-0014 AND THE VIEW BEFORE ME SEEMED LIKE A WATERY DECLIVITY REACHING FOR A THOUSAND MILES TILL IT APPROACHED THE HORIZON FAR UP IN THE SKY NOR WAS IT ANY DELUSION OF THE SENSES THAT CAUSED THIS UNPARALLELED SPECTACLE
1018-135221-0015 I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE PHENOMENA OF THE MIRAGE AND KNEW WELL THAT THERE WAS NOTHING OF THAT KIND HERE FOR THE MIRAGE ALWAYS SHOWS GREAT SURFACES OF STILLNESS OR A REGULAR VIBRATION GLASSY TIDES AND INDISTINCT DISTANCES
1018-135221-0016 BROUGHT WITH IT SUCH EXHILARATING INFLUENCES THAT IT ACTED UPON ME LIKE SOME REVIVING CORDIAL FROM THE WORKS OF NATURE I TURNED TO THOSE OF MAN THESE WERE VISIBLE EVERYWHERE ON THE LAND
1018-135221-0017 IN CITIES AND CULTIVATED FIELDS AND MIGHTY CONSTRUCTIONS ON THE SEA IN FLOATING CRAFT WHICH APPEARED WHEREVER I TURNED MY EYES BOATS LIKE THOSE OF FISHERMEN SHIPS LONG AND LOW SOME LIKE GALLEYS PROPELLED BY A HUNDRED OARS
1018-135221-0018 OTHERS PROVIDED WITH ONE HUGE SQUARE SAIL WHICH ENABLED THEM TO RUN BEFORE THE WIND THEY WERE UNLIKE ANY SHIPS WHICH I HAD EVER SEEN FOR NEITHER IN THE MEDITERRANEAN NOR IN CHINESE WATERS WERE THERE ANY CRAFT LIKE THESE
1018-135221-0019 AND THEY REMINDED ME RATHER OF THOSE ANCIENT GALLEYS WHICH I HAD SEEN IN PICTURES I WAS LOST IN WONDER AS TO WHERE I WAS AND WHAT LAND THIS COULD BE TO WHICH I HAD BEEN BROUGHT I HAD NOT PLUNGED INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH
1018-135221-0020 BUT I HAD BEEN CARRIED UNDER THE MOUNTAINS AND HAD EMERGED AGAIN INTO THE GLAD LIGHT OF THE SUN COULD IT BE POSSIBLE I THOUGHT THAT AGNEW'S HOPE HAD BEEN REALIZED AND THAT I HAD BEEN CARRIED INTO THE WARM REGIONS OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC OCEAN
1018-135221-0021 YET IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC THERE COULD BE NO PLACE LIKE THIS NO IMMEASURABLE EXPANSE OF WATERS NO HORIZON RAISED MOUNTAIN HIGH IT SEEMED LIKE A VAST BASIN SHAPED WORLD FOR ALL AROUND ME THE SURFACE APPEARED TO RISE
1018-135221-0022 AND I WAS IN WHAT LOOKED LIKE A DEPRESSION YET I KNEW THAT THE BASIN AND THE DEPRESSION WERE AN ILLUSION AND THAT THIS APPEARANCE WAS DUE TO THE IMMENSE EXTENT OF LEVEL SURFACE WITH THE ENVIRONMENT OF LOFTY MOUNTAINS I HAD CROSSED THE ANTARCTIC CIRCLE
1018-135221-0023 I HAD BEEN BORNE ONWARD FOR AN IMMENSE DISTANCE OVER ALL THE KNOWN SURFACE OF THE EARTH NO ONE HAD EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS THERE WERE BUT TWO PLACES WHERE SUCH AN IMMEASURABLE PLAIN WAS POSSIBLE AND THOSE WERE AT THE FLATTENED POLES
1018-135221-0024 WHERE I WAS I NOW KNEW WELL I HAD REACHED THE ANTARCTIC POLE HERE THE EARTH WAS FLAT AN IMMENSE LEVEL WITH NO ROUNDNESS TO LESSEN THE REACH OF THE HORIZON BUT AN ALMOST EVEN SURFACE THAT GAVE AN UNIMPEDED VIEW FOR HUNDREDS OF MILES
1018-135221-0025 THE SUBTERRANEAN CHANNEL HAD RUSHED THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS AND HAD CARRIED ME HERE HERE CAME ALL THE WATERS OF THE NORTHERN OCEAN POURING INTO THIS VAST POLAR SEA PERHAPS TO ISSUE FORTH FROM IT BY SOME SIMILAR PASSAGE HERE THEN WAS THE SOUTH POLE
1018-135221-0026 A WORLD BY ITSELF AND HOW DIFFERENT FROM THAT TERRIBLE THAT IRON LAND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS NOT A WORLD OF ICE AND FROST BUT ONE OF BEAUTY AND LIGHT WITH A CLIMATE THAT WAS ALMOST TROPICAL IN ITS WARMTH
1018-135221-0027 AND LANDS THAT WERE COVERED WITH THE RANK LUXURIANCE OF A TEEMING VEGETABLE LIFE I HAD PASSED FROM THAT OUTER WORLD TO THIS INNER ONE AND THE PASSAGE WAS FROM DEATH UNTO LIFE FROM AGONY AND DESPAIR TO SUNLIGHT AND SPLENDOR AND JOY
1018-135221-0028 ABOVE ALL IN ALL AROUND ME THAT WHICH MOST IMPRESSED ME NOW WAS THE RICH AND SUPERABUNDANT LIFE AND A WARMTH OF AIR WHICH MADE ME THINK OF INDIA IT WAS AN AMAZING AND AN UNACCOUNTABLE THING
1018-135221-0029 AND I COULD ONLY ATTRIBUTE IT TO THE FLATTENING OF THE POLES WHICH BROUGHT THE SURFACE NEARER TO THE SUPPOSED CENTRAL FIRES OF THE EARTH AND THEREFORE CREATED A HEAT AS GREAT AS THAT OF THE EQUATORIAL REGIONS HERE I FOUND A TROPICAL CLIMATE
1018-135221-0030 A LAND WARMED NOT BY THE SUN BUT FROM THE EARTH ITSELF OR ANOTHER CAUSE MIGHT BE FOUND IN THE WARM OCEAN CURRENTS WHATEVER THE TRUE ONE MIGHT BE I WAS UTTERLY UNABLE TO FORM A CONJECTURE BUT I HAD NO TIME FOR SUCH SPECULATIONS AS THESE
1018-135221-0031 AFTER THE FIRST EMOTIONS OF WONDER AND ADMIRATION HAD SOMEWHAT SUBSIDED I BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE OTHER SENSATIONS I BEGAN TO REMEMBER THAT I HAD EATEN NOTHING FOR A LENGTH OF TIME THAT I HAD NO MEANS OF CALCULATING
1018-135221-0032 AND TO LOOK AROUND TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY WAY OF SATISFYING MY HUNGER THE QUESTION AROSE NOW WHAT WAS TO BE DONE AFTER MY RECENT TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE I NATURALLY SHRANK FROM AGAIN COMMITTING MYSELF TO THE TENDER MERCIES OF STRANGE TRIBES
1018-135221-0033 YET FURTHER THOUGHT AND EXAMINATION SHOWED ME THAT THE PEOPLE OF THIS STRANGE LAND MUST BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE FRIGHTFUL SAVAGES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS EVERYWHERE I BEHELD THE MANIFEST SIGNS OF CULTIVATION AND CIVILIZATION
1018-135221-0034 MY HUNGER WAS BEGINNING TO BE INSUPPORTABLE I HAD REACHED A PLACE WHERE I HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN STARVATION ON THE ONE HAND OR A VENTURE AMONG THESE PEOPLE ON THE OTHER TO GO BACK WAS IMPOSSIBLE WHO COULD BREAST THOSE WATERS IN THE TREMENDOUS SUBTERRANEAN CHANNEL
1018-135221-0035 OR FORCE HIS WAY BACK THROUGH SUCH APPALLING DANGERS OR IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE WHO COULD EVER HOPE TO BREAST THOSE MIGHTY CURRENTS BEYOND OR WORK HIS WAY AMID EVERLASTING ICE AND IMMEASURABLE SEAS NO RETURN WAS IMPOSSIBLE
1018-135221-0036 I HAD BEEN FLUNG INTO THIS WORLD OF WONDERS AND HERE WOULD BE MY HOME FOR THE REMAINDER OF MY DAYS THOUGH I COULD NOT NOW IMAGINE WHETHER THOSE DAYS WOULD BE PASSED IN PEACE OR IN BITTER SLAVERY AND SORROW YET THE DECISION MUST BE MADE
1018-135221-0037 AND THE RISK MUST BE RUN IT MUST BE SO I MUST LAND HERE VENTURE AMONG THESE PEOPLE AND TRUST IN THAT PROVIDENCE WHICH HAD HITHERTO SUSTAINED ME HAVING THUS RESOLVED AT ALL HAZARDS TO TRY MY FATE I ROWED IN TOWARD THE SHORE
1018-135221-0038 THUS FAR I HAD SEEN GALLEYS PASSING AND SMALL BOATS BUT THEY HAD TAKEN NO NOTICE OF ME FOR THE REASON THAT THEY WERE TOO FAR AWAY TO PERCEIVE ANYTHING ABOUT ME THAT DIFFERED FROM ANY OTHER BOAT BUT NOW AS I ROWED I NOTICED A GALLEY COMING DOWN TOWARD ME
1018-135221-0039 SHE SEEMED TO BE GOING IN TOWARD THE SHORE AT THE VERY POINT AT WHICH I WAS AIMING AND HER COURSE AND MINE MUST SOON MEET IF I CONTINUED TO ROW AFTER SOME HESITATION I CONCLUDED TO MAKE SIGNALS TO HER SO AS TO ATTRACT ATTENTION
1018-135221-0040 THE STEM WAS RAISED AND COVERED IN LIKE A CABIN AT LENGTH I CEASED ROWING AND SAT WATCHING HER I SOON SAW THAT I WAS NOTICED BUT THIS DID NOT OCCUR TILL THE GALLEY WAS CLOSE BY ME SO CLOSE INDEED THAT I THOUGHT THEY WOULD PASS WITHOUT PERCEIVING ME
1018-135221-0041 I RAISED MY HANDS WAVED THEM AND GAVE A CRY THE GALLEY AT ONCE STOPPED A BOAT WAS LOWERED AND SOME MEN DESCENDED AND ROWED TOWARD ME THEY WERE MEN OF STRANGE APPEARANCE VERY SMALL IN STATURE AND SLENDER IN FRAME
