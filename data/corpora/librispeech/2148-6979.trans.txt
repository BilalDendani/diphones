2148-6979-0000 THIS WAS A BLACK DAY IN OUR CALENDAR AT SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
2148-6979-0001 AND HAD THE STRAP AND BLOCK A COIL OF HALYARDS AND A MARLINE SPIKE ABOUT HIS NECK HE FELL FROM THE STARBOARD FUTTOCK SHROUDS AND NOT KNOWING HOW TO SWIM AND BEING HEAVILY DRESSED
2148-6979-0002 HE PROBABLY SANK IMMEDIATELY WE PULLED ASTERN IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH HE FELL AND THOUGH WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE OF SAVING HIM YET NO ONE WISHED TO SPEAK OF RETURNING
2148-6979-0003 BUT UNWILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE TO OURSELVES THAT WE MUST GIVE HIM UP AT LENGTH WE TURNED THE BOAT'S HEAD
2148-6979-0004 A MAN DIES ON SHORE HIS BODY REMAINS WITH HIS FRIENDS AND THE MOURNERS GO ABOUT THE STREETS BUT WHEN A MAN FALLS OVERBOARD AT SEA AND IS LOST THERE IS A SUDDENNESS IN THE EVENT AND A DIFFICULTY IN REALIZING IT
2148-6979-0005 WHICH GIVE TO IT AN AIR OF AWFUL MYSTERY A MAN DIES ON SHORE YOU FOLLOW HIS BODY TO THE GRAVE AND A STONE MARKS THE SPOT YOU ARE OFTEN PREPARED FOR THE EVENT
2148-6979-0006 THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING WHICH HELPS YOU TO REALIZE IT WHEN IT HAPPENS AND TO RECALL IT WHEN IT HAS PASSED A MAN IS SHOT DOWN BY YOUR SIDE IN BATTLE AND THE MANGLED BODY REMAINS AN OBJECT AND A REAL EVIDENCE BUT AT SEA THE MAN IS NEAR YOU AT YOUR SIDE
2148-6979-0007 AND NOTHING BUT A VACANCY SHOWS HIS LOSS THEN TOO AT SEA TO USE A HOMELY BUT EXPRESSIVE PHRASE YOU MISS A MAN SO MUCH A DOZEN MEN ARE SHUT UP TOGETHER IN A LITTLE BARK UPON THE WIDE WIDE SEA
2148-6979-0008 AND FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS SEE NO FORMS AND HEAR NO VOICES BUT THEIR OWN AND ONE IS TAKEN SUDDENLY FROM AMONG THEM AND THEY MISS HIM AT EVERY TURN IT IS LIKE LOSING A LIMB
2148-6979-0009 THERE ARE NO NEW FACES OR NEW SCENES TO FILL UP THE GAP THERE IS ALWAYS AN EMPTY BERTH IN THE FORECASTLE
2148-6979-0010 THERE IS ONE LESS TO TAKE THE WHEEL AND ONE LESS TO LAY OUT WITH YOU UPON THE YARD YOU MISS HIS FORM AND THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE FOR HABIT HAD MADE THEM ALMOST NECESSARY TO YOU AND EACH OF YOUR SENSES FEELS THE LOSS
2148-6979-0011 ALL THESE THINGS MAKE SUCH A DEATH PECULIARLY SOLEMN AND THE EFFECT OF IT REMAINS UPON THE CREW FOR SOME TIME THERE IS MORE KINDNESS SHOWN BY THE OFFICERS TO THE CREW AND BY THE CREW TO ONE ANOTHER THERE IS MORE QUIETNESS AND SERIOUSNESS
2148-6979-0012 THE OATH AND THE LOUD LAUGH ARE GONE THE OFFICERS ARE MORE WATCHFUL AND THE CREW GO MORE CAREFULLY ALOFT
2148-6979-0013 THE LOST MAN IS SELDOM MENTIONED OR IS DISMISSED WITH A SAILOR'S RUDE EULOGY WELL POOR GEORGE IS GONE HIS CRUISE IS UP SOON HE KNEW HIS WORK AND DID HIS DUTY AND WAS A GOOD SHIPMATE
2148-6979-0014 THEN USUALLY FOLLOWS SOME ALLUSION TO ANOTHER WORLD
2148-6979-0015 THEY SAY GOD WON'T BE HARD UPON THE POOR FELLOW AND SELDOM GET BEYOND THE COMMON PHRASE WHICH SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT THEIR SUFFERINGS AND HARD TREATMENT HERE
2148-6979-0016 WOULD BE HARD INDEED OUR COOK A SIMPLE HEARTED OLD AFRICAN WHO HAD BEEN THROUGH A GOOD DEAL IN HIS DAY AND WAS RATHER SERIOUSLY INCLINED ALWAYS GOING TO CHURCH TWICE A DAY WHEN ON SHORE AND READING HIS BIBLE ON A SUNDAY IN THE GALLEY
2148-6979-0017 AND TOLD THEM THAT THEY MIGHT GO AS SUDDENLY AS GEORGE HAD AND BE AS LITTLE PREPARED YET A SAILOR'S LIFE IS AT BEST BUT A MIXTURE OF A LITTLE GOOD WITH MUCH EVIL AND A LITTLE PLEASURE WITH MUCH PAIN
2148-6979-0018 THE BEAUTIFUL IS LINKED WITH THE REVOLTING THE SUBLIME WITH THE COMMONPLACE AND THE SOLEMN WITH THE LUDICROUS
2148-6979-0019 THE CAPTAIN HAD FIRST HOWEVER CALLED ALL HANDS AFT AND ASKED THEM IF THEY WERE SATISFIED THAT EVERYTHING HAD BEEN DONE TO SAVE THE MAN AND IF THEY THOUGHT THERE WAS ANY USE IN REMAINING THERE LONGER
2148-6979-0020 FOR THE MAN DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SWIM AND WAS VERY HEAVILY DRESSED
2148-6979-0021 THE LAWS REGULATING NAVIGATION MAKE THE CAPTAIN ANSWERABLE FOR THE EFFECTS OF A SAILOR WHO DIES DURING THE VOYAGE
2148-6979-0022 IN WHICH THEY ARE BID OFF BY THE SAILORS AND THE SUMS WHICH THEY GIVE ARE DEDUCTED FROM THEIR WAGES AT THE END OF THE VOYAGE IN THIS WAY THE TROUBLE AND RISK OF KEEPING HIS THINGS THROUGH THE VOYAGE ARE AVOIDED
2148-6979-0023 AND USED AS A STORE CHEST SO THAT THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT WHICH COULD BE CALLED HIS SAILORS HAVE AN UNWILLINGNESS TO WEAR A DEAD MAN'S CLOTHES DURING THE SAME VOYAGE AND THEY SELDOM DO SO UNLESS THEY ARE IN ABSOLUTE WANT
2148-6979-0024 AS IS USUAL AFTER A DEATH MANY STORIES WERE TOLD ABOUT GEORGE SOME HAD HEARD HIM SAY THAT HE REPENTED NEVER HAVING LEARNED TO SWIM AND THAT HE KNEW THAT HE SHOULD MEET HIS DEATH BY DROWNING
2148-6979-0025 AND THE DECEASED MAN SHIPPED AND SPENT HIS ADVANCE AND WAS AFTERWARDS VERY UNWILLING TO GO BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO REFUND WAS OBLIGED TO SAIL WITH US A BOY TOO WHO HAD BECOME QUITE ATTACHED TO HIM
2148-6979-0026 SAID THAT GEORGE TALKED TO HIM DURING MOST OF THE WATCH ON THE NIGHT BEFORE ABOUT HIS MOTHER AND FAMILY AT HOME AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT HE HAD MENTIONED THE SUBJECT DURING THE VOYAGE THE NIGHT AFTER THIS EVENT WHEN I WENT TO THE GALLEY TO GET A LIGHT
2148-6979-0027 I FOUND THE COOK INCLINED TO BE TALKATIVE
2148-6979-0028 I WAS THE MORE INCLINED TO DO SO
2148-6979-0029 AND WHICH THE RECENT DEATH HAD WAKED UP IN HIS MIND HE TALKED ABOUT GEORGE'S HAVING SPOKEN OF HIS FRIENDS AND SAID HE BELIEVED FEW MEN DIED WITHOUT HAVING A WARNING OF IT WHICH HE SUPPORTED BY A GREAT MANY STORIES OF DREAMS AND THE UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR OF MEN BEFORE DEATH
2148-6979-0030 FROM THIS HE WENT ON TO OTHER SUPERSTITIONS THE FLYING DUTCHMAN ET CETERA AND TALKED RATHER MYSTERIOUSLY HAVING SOMETHING EVIDENTLY ON HIS MIND AT LENGTH HE PUT HIS HEAD OUT OF THE GALLEY AND LOOKED CAREFULLY ABOUT TO SEE IF ANY ONE WAS WITHIN HEARING
2148-6979-0031 I SAY YOU KNOW WHAT COUNTRYMAN E CARPENTER BE
2148-6979-0032 WHAT KIND OF A GERMAN SAID THE COOK HE BELONGS TO BREMEN SAID I ARE YOU SURE O DAT
2148-6979-0033 I'M PLAGUY GLAD O DAT SAID THE COOK I WAS MIGHTY FRAID HE WAS A FIN
2148-6979-0034 AND ESPECIALLY HAVE POWER OVER WINDS AND STORMS I TRIED TO REASON WITH HIM ABOUT IT BUT HE HAD THE BEST OF ALL ARGUMENTS THAT FROM EXPERIENCE AT HAND AND WAS NOT TO BE MOVED
2148-6979-0035 AND COULD DO ANYTHING HE WAS OF A MIND TO THIS SAIL MAKER KEPT A JUNK BOTTLE IN HIS BERTH
2148-6979-0036 THOUGH HE GOT DRUNK UPON IT NEARLY EVERY DAY HE HAD SEEN HIM SIT FOR HOURS TOGETHER TALKING TO THIS BOTTLE
2148-6979-0037 THE SAME MAN CUT HIS THROAT IN HIS BERTH AND EVERYBODY SAID HE WAS POSSESSED HE HAD HEARD OF SHIPS TOO BEATING UP THE GULF OF FINLAND AGAINST A HEAD WIND AND HAVING A SHIP HEAVE IN SIGHT ASTERN OVERHAUL AND PASS THEM
2148-6979-0038 WITH AS FAIR A WIND AS COULD BLOW AND ALL STUDDING SAILS OUT AND FIND SHE WAS FROM FINLAND
2148-6979-0039 I'VE SEEN TOO MUCH OF THEM MEN TO WANT TO SEE EM
2148-6979-0040 IF THEY CAN'T HAVE THEIR OWN WAY THEY'LL PLAY THE D L WITH YOU AS I STILL DOUBTED HE SAID HE WOULD LEAVE IT TO JOHN WHO WAS THE OLDEST SEAMAN ABOARD AND WOULD KNOW IF ANYBODY DID
2148-6979-0041 JOHN TO BE SURE WAS THE OLDEST AND AT THE SAME TIME THE MOST IGNORANT MAN IN THE SHIP BUT I CONSENTED TO HAVE HIM CALLED THE COOK STATED THE MATTER TO HIM AND JOHN AS I ANTICIPATED SIDED WITH THE COOK AND SAID THAT HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN IN A SHIP
2148-6979-0042 AND IMMEDIATELY TOLD HIM IF HE DIDN'T STOP THE HEAD WIND HE WOULD SHUT HIM DOWN IN THE FORE PEAK
2148-6979-0043 WHEN HE COULD NOT STAND IT ANY LONGER AND DID SOMETHING OR OTHER WHICH BROUGHT THE WIND ROUND AGAIN AND THEY LET HIM UP THERE SAID THE COOK
2148-6979-0044 OH SAYS HE GO WAY
