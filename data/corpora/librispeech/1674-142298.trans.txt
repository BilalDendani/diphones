1674-142298-0002 THE NEXT MORNING MARGARET DRAGGED HERSELF UP THANKFUL THAT THE NIGHT WAS OVER UNREFRESHED YET RESTED ALL HAD GONE WELL THROUGH THE HOUSE HER MOTHER HAD ONLY WAKENED ONCE
1674-142298-0003 A LITTLE BREEZE WAS STIRRING IN THE HOT AIR AND THOUGH THERE WERE NO TREES TO SHOW THE PLAYFUL TOSSING MOVEMENT CAUSED BY THE WIND AMONG THE LEAVES MARGARET KNEW HOW SOMEWHERE OR ANOTHER BY WAY SIDE IN COPSES OR IN THICK GREEN WOODS
1674-142298-0004 THERE WAS A PLEASANT MURMURING DANCING SOUND A RUSHING AND FALLING NOISE THE VERY THOUGHT OF WHICH WAS AN ECHO OF DISTANT GLADNESS IN HER HEART SHE SAT AT HER WORK IN MISSUS HALE'S ROOM
1674-142298-0005 SHE WOULD HELP HER MOTHER TO DRESS AFTER DINNER SHE WOULD GO AND SEE BESSY HIGGINS SHE WOULD BANISH ALL RECOLLECTION OF THE THORNTON FAMILY NO NEED TO THINK OF THEM TILL THEY ABSOLUTELY STOOD BEFORE HER IN FLESH AND BLOOD BUT OF COURSE
1674-142298-0006 THE EFFORT NOT TO THINK OF THEM BROUGHT THEM ONLY THE MORE STRONGLY BEFORE HER AND FROM TIME TO TIME THE HOT FLUSH CAME OVER HER PALE FACE SWEEPING IT INTO COLOUR AS A SUNBEAM FROM BETWEEN WATERY CLOUDS COMES SWIFTLY MOVING OVER THE SEA
1674-142298-0007 DIXON OPENED THE DOOR VERY SOFTLY AND STOLE ON TIPTOE UP TO MARGARET SITTING BY THE SHADED WINDOW MISTER THORNTON MISS MARGARET HE IS IN THE DRAWING ROOM MARGARET DROPPED HER SEWING

1674-142298-0009 SAID MARGARET QUIETLY BUT SHE LINGERED STRANGELY MISTER THORNTON STOOD BY ONE OF THE WINDOWS WITH HIS BACK TO THE DOOR APPARENTLY ABSORBED IN WATCHING SOMETHING IN THE STREET BUT IN TRUTH HE WAS AFRAID OF HIMSELF
1674-142298-0010 HIS HEART BEAT THICK AT THE THOUGHT OF HER COMING HE COULD NOT FORGET THE TOUCH OF HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK IMPATIENTLY FELT AS IT HAD BEEN AT THE TIME BUT NOW THE RECOLLECTION OF HER CLINGING DEFENCE OF HIM SEEMED TO THRILL HIM THROUGH AND THROUGH
1674-142298-0011 TO MELT AWAY EVERY RESOLUTION ALL POWER OF SELF CONTROL AS IF IT WERE WAX BEFORE A FIRE HE DREADED LEST HE SHOULD GO FORWARDS TO MEET HER WITH HIS ARMS HELD OUT IN MUTE ENTREATY THAT SHE WOULD COME AND NESTLE THERE AS SHE HAD DONE
1674-142298-0012 ALL UNHEEDED THE DAY BEFORE BUT NEVER UNHEEDED AGAIN HIS HEART THROBBED LOUD AND QUICK STRONG MAN AS HE WAS HE TREMBLED AT THE ANTICIPATION OF WHAT HE HAD TO SAY AND HOW IT MIGHT BE RECEIVED
1674-142298-0013 SHE MIGHT DROOP AND FLUSH AND FLUTTER TO HIS ARMS AS TO HER NATURAL HOME AND RESTING PLACE ONE MOMENT HE GLOWED WITH IMPATIENCE AT THE THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT DO THIS THE NEXT HE FEARED A PASSIONATE REJECTION
1674-142298-0014 THE VERY IDEA OF WHICH WITHERED UP HIS FUTURE WITH SO DEADLY A BLIGHT THAT HE REFUSED TO THINK OF IT HE WAS STARTLED BY THE SENSE OF THE PRESENCE OF SOME ONE ELSE IN THE ROOM HE TURNED ROUND SHE HAD COME IN SO GENTLY THAT HE HAD NEVER HEARD HER
1674-142298-0015 THE STREET NOISES HAD BEEN MORE DISTINCT TO HIS INATTENTIVE EAR THAN HER SLOW MOVEMENTS IN HER SOFT MUSLIN GOWN SHE STOOD BY THE TABLE NOT OFFERING TO SIT DOWN HER EYELIDS WERE DROPPED HALF OVER HER EYES
1674-142298-0016 HER TEETH WERE SHUT NOT COMPRESSED HER LIPS WERE JUST PARTED OVER THEM ALLOWING THE WHITE LINE TO BE SEEN BETWEEN THEIR CURVE HER SLOW DEEP BREATHINGS DILATED HER THIN AND BEAUTIFUL NOSTRILS IT WAS THE ONLY MOTION VISIBLE
1674-142298-0017 ON HER COUNTENANCE THE FINE GRAINED SKIN THE OVAL CHEEK THE RICH OUTLINE OF HER MOUTH ITS CORNERS DEEP SET IN DIMPLES WERE ALL WAN AND PALE TO DAY THE LOSS OF THEIR USUAL NATURAL HEALTHY COLOUR BEING MADE MORE EVIDENT
1674-142298-0018 BY THE HEAVY SHADOW OF THE DARK HAIR BROUGHT DOWN UPON THE TEMPLES TO HIDE ALL SIGN OF THE BLOW SHE HAD RECEIVED HER HEAD FOR ALL ITS DROOPING EYES WAS THROWN A LITTLE BACK IN THE OLD PROUD ATTITUDE
1674-142298-0019 HER LONG ARMS HUNG MOTION LESS BY HER SIDES ALTOGETHER SHE LOOKED LIKE SOME PRISONER FALSELY ACCUSED OF A CRIME THAT SHE LOATHED AND DESPISED AND FROM WHICH SHE WAS TOO INDIGNANT TO JUSTIFY HERSELF MISTER THORNTON MADE A HASTY STEP OR TWO FORWARDS
1674-142298-0020 RECOVERED HIMSELF AND WENT WITH QUIET FIRMNESS TO THE DOOR WHICH SHE HAD LEFT OPEN AND SHUT IT THEN HE CAME BACK AND STOOD OPPOSITE TO HER FOR A MOMENT RECEIVING THE GENERAL IMPRESSION OF HER BEAUTIFUL PRESENCE
