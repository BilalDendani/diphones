2356-154880-0002 AND IN ONE OF HIS EARLY NOVELS HAS LEFT AN INTERESTING AND ACCURATE PICTURE OF ITS THEN CONDITION WHICH MAY BE CONTRASTED WITH THAT OF AN EARLIER PERIOD LEFT BY THE ENGLISH OPIUM EATER AT SIXTEEN A BRILLIANT HANDSOME YOUTH

2356-154880-0009 BUT WHATEVER INTENTIONS HE MAY HAVE FORMED OF HUMDRUM STUDY AND DETERMINED ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS OF A PROFESSION IN WHICH HE HAD NO INTEREST WERE DISSIPATED BY CONTACT WITH THE LITERARY WORLD OF THE METROPOLIS
2356-154880-0010 HE MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MISTER JOHN EBERS WHO AT THAT TIME COMBINED THE DUTIES OF MANAGER OF THE OPERA HOUSE WITH THE BUSINESS OF A PUBLISHER HE IT WAS WHO ISSUED SIR JOHN CHIVERTON AND THE VERSES FORMING ITS DEDICATION ARE UNDERSTOOD TO HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED TO

2356-154880-0016 APPARENTLY IN A GLOW OF INSPIRATION IN LESS THAN A DAY AND A HALF THE FEAT HE SAYS FOR FEAT IT WAS BEING THE COMPOSITION OF A HUNDRED NOVEL PAGES IN LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS WAS ACHIEVED AT THE ELMS A HOUSE I THEN OCCUPIED AT KILBURN
2356-154880-0017 THE SUCCESS OF ROOKWOOD WAS MARKED AND IMMEDIATE AINSWORTH AT A BOUND REACHED POPULARITY THIS WAS IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FOUR
2356-154880-0018 WHICH IS A FINE PIECE OF HISTORICAL ROMANCE THE CRITICS WHO HAD OBJECTED TO THE ROMANTIC GLAMOR CAST OVER THE CAREER OF DICK TURPIN WERE STILL FURTHER HORRIFIED AT THE MANNER IN WHICH THAT VULGAR RASCAL JACK SHEPPARD
2356-154880-0019 WAS ELEVATED INTO A HERO OF ROMANCE THE OUTCRY WAS NOT ENTIRELY WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION NOR WAS IT WITHOUT EFFECT ON THE NOVELIST WHO THENCEFORWARD AVOIDED THIS PERILOUS GROUND
2356-154880-0020 JACK SHEPPARD APPEARED IN BENTLEY'S MISCELLANY OF WHICH AINSWORTH BECAME EDITOR IN MARCH EIGHTEEN FORTY
2356-154880-0021 THE STORY IS POWERFULLY WRITTEN

2356-154880-0023 IN EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE
2356-154880-0024 WHICH CAME TO AN END IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE WHEN HE ACQUIRED THE NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE WHICH HE EDITED FOR MANY YEARS THIS WAS THE HEYDAY OF AINSWORTH'S REPUTATION ALIKE IN LITERATURE AND IN SOCIETY
2356-154880-0025 HIS HOME AT KENSAL MANOR HOUSE BECAME FAMOUS FOR ITS HOSPITALITY AND DICKENS THACKERAY LANDSEER CLARKSON STANFIELD TALFOURD JERROLD AND CRUIKSHANK WERE AMONG HIS GUESTS
2356-154880-0026 THE LIST OF HIS PRINCIPAL HISTORICAL NOVELS WITH THEIR DATES OF ISSUE MAY NOW BE GIVEN ROOKWOOD EIGHTEEN THIRTY FOUR

2356-154880-0031 THE GOLDSMITH'S WIFE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR THESE NOVELS ALL MET WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SUCCESS BUT THOSE OF LATER YEARS DID NOT ATTAIN THE STRIKING POPULARITY OF HIS EARLIER EFFORTS
2356-154880-0032 MANY HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED INTO VARIOUS MODERN LANGUAGES AND THE EDITIONS OF HIS VARIOUS WORKS ARE SO NUMEROUS
2356-154880-0033 THE SCENERY AND HISTORY OF HIS NATIVE COUNTRY HAD A PERENNIAL INTEREST FOR HIM
2356-154880-0034 MAY ALMOST BE SAID TO FORM A NOVELIST'S HISTORY OF LANCASHIRE FROM THE PILGRIMAGE OF GRACE UNTIL THE EARLY PART OF THE PRESENT CENTURY PROBABLY NO MORE VIVID ACCOUNT HAS BEEN WRITTEN OF THE GREAT FIRE AND PLAGUE OF LONDON
2356-154880-0035 THE CHARM OF AINSWORTH'S NOVELS IS NOT AT ALL DEPENDENT UPON THE ANALYSIS OF MOTIVES OR SUBTLE DESCRIPTION OF CHARACTER OF THIS HE HAS LITTLE OR NOTHING BUT HE REALIZES VIVIDLY A SCENE OR AN INCIDENT
2356-154880-0036 AINSWORTH CAME UPON THE READING WORLD AT A HAPPY MOMENT PEOPLE WERE WEARY OF THE INANITIES OF THE FASHIONABLE NOVEL AND WERE READY TO LISTEN TO ONE WHO HAD A POWER OF VIVACIOUS NARRATIVE IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE
2356-154880-0037 WHEN HE WAS IN HIS SEVENTY SEVENTH YEAR A PLEASANT TRIBUTE OF RESPECT AND ADMIRATION WAS PAID TO HIM IN HIS NATIVE TOWN THE MAYOR OF MANCHESTER ENTERTAINED HIM AT A BANQUET IN THE TOWN HALL SEPTEMBER FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE
2356-154880-0038 AS AN EXPRESSION OF THE HIGH ESTEEM IN WHICH HE IS HELD BY HIS FELLOW TOWNSMEN AND OF HIS SERVICES TO LITERATURE IN PROPOSING MISTER AINSWORTH'S HEALTH THE MAYOR GAVE A CURIOUS INSTANCE OF THE POPULARITY OF HIS WRITINGS
2356-154880-0039 IN OUR MANCHESTER PUBLIC FREE LIBRARIES THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY VOLUMES OF MISTER AINSWORTH'S DIFFERENT WORKS DURING THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS THESE VOLUMES HAVE BEEN READ SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY TIMES
2356-154880-0040 MOSTLY BY THE ARTISAN CLASS OF READERS AND THIS MEANS THAT TWENTY VOLUMES OF HIS WORKS ARE BEING PERUSED IN MANCHESTER BY READERS OF THE FREE LIBRARIES
2356-154880-0041 IT WAS WELL THAT THIS PLEASANT RECOGNITION WAS NOT LONGER DELAYED THE CONTRAST WAS PATHETICALLY GREAT BETWEEN THE TALL HANDSOME DANDIFIED FIGURE PRESENTED IN THE PORTRAITS OF HIM BY PICKERSGILL AND MACLISE AND THE BENT
2356-154880-0042 AND FEEBLE OLD MAN WHO STOOD BY AND ACKNOWLEDGED THE PLAUDITS OF THOSE WHO HAD ASSEMBLED TO HONOR HIM HIS LAST PUBLISHED WORK WAS STANLEY BRERETON WHICH HE DEDICATED TO HIS HOSPITABLE ENTERTAINER
2356-154880-0043 HE DIED AT REIGATE JANUARY THIRD EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO LEAVING A WIDOW AND ALSO THREE DAUGHTERS BY HIS FIRST MARRIAGE
