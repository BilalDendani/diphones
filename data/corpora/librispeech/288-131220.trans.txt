288-131220-0000 BEFORE THE END OF THE MONTH RUBY HAD GOT RESPECTABLY THIN AND DIAMOND RESPECTABLY STOUT THEY REALLY BEGAN TO LOOK FIT FOR DOUBLE HARNESS JOSEPH AND HIS WIFE GOT THEIR AFFAIRS IN ORDER
288-131220-0001 AND EVERYTHING READY FOR MIGRATING AT THE SHORTEST NOTICE
288-131220-0002 AS FOR NANNY SHE HAD BEEN SO HAPPY EVER SINCE SHE LEFT THE HOSPITAL
288-131220-0003 TILL SOME TIME AFTER SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE HE WAS TOO SHY TO GO AND INQUIRE ABOUT HER BUT WHEN AT LENGTH SHE WENT TO LIVE WITH DIAMOND'S FAMILY
288-131220-0004 DURING WHICH THEY HAD BEEN TALKING OF HER NEW PROSPECTS THAT NANNY EXPRESSED TO DIAMOND HER OPINION OF THE COUNTRY THERE AIN'T NOTHING IN IT BUT THE SUN AND MOON DIAMOND THERE'S TREES AND FLOWERS SAID DIAMOND
288-131220-0005 SAID MISTER RAYMOND I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU
288-131220-0006 HIS OPINION OF HIM WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM NANNY'S
288-131220-0007 HE ASKED I'M ALWAYS WANTING SOMETHING SIR ANSWERED DIAMOND WELL THAT'S QUITE RIGHT SO LONG AS WHAT YOU WANT IS RIGHT EVERYBODY IS ALWAYS WANTING SOMETHING ONLY WE DON'T MENTION IT
288-131220-0008 WHAT IS IT NOW THERE'S A FRIEND OF NANNY'S A LAME BOY CALLED JIM I'VE HEARD OF HIM SAID MISTER RAYMOND WELL NANNY DOESN'T CARE MUCH ABOUT GOING TO THE COUNTRY SIR
288-131220-0009 I KNOW HE CAN SHINE BOOTS SIR SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR US
288-131220-0010 THEY THINK I'M SILLY ADDED DIAMOND WITH ONE OF HIS SWEETEST SMILES WHAT MISTER RAYMOND THOUGHT I DARE HARDLY ATTEMPT TO PUT DOWN HERE
288-131220-0011 PEOPLE'S KIND TO LAME BOYS YOU KNOW SIR BUT AFTER DARK THERE AIN'T SO MUCH DOING DIAMOND SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING JIM TO MISTER RAYMOND AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT HE RESOLVED TO GIVE THE BOY A CHANCE HE PROVIDED NEW CLOTHES FOR BOTH HIM AND NANNY
288-131220-0012 AND UPON A CERTAIN DAY JOSEPH TOOK HIS WIFE AND THREE CHILDREN AND NANNY AND JIM
288-131220-0013 WHERE THEY FOUND A CART WAITING TO CARRY THEM AND THEIR LUGGAGE TO THE MOUND WHICH WAS THE NAME OF MISTER RAYMOND'S NEW RESIDENCE I WILL NOT DESCRIBE THE VARIED FEELINGS OF THE PARTY AS THEY WENT OR WHEN THEY ARRIVED ALL I WILL SAY IS THAT DIAMOND WHO IS MY ONLY CARE WAS FULL OF QUIET DELIGHT
288-131220-0014 FOR MISTER RAYMOND WAS AN OLD BACHELOR NO LONGER HE WAS BRINGING HIS WIFE WITH HIM TO LIVE AT THE MOUND THE MOMENT NANNY SAW HER SHE RECOGNISED HER AS THE LADY WHO HAD LENT HER THE RUBY RING THAT RING HAD BEEN GIVEN HER BY MISTER RAYMOND
288-131220-0015 THE WEATHER WAS VERY HOT AND THE WOODS VERY SHADOWY THERE WERE NOT A GREAT MANY WILD FLOWERS
288-131220-0016 AND THE MOST OF THE WILD FLOWERS RISE EARLY TO BE BEFORE THE LEAVES BECAUSE IF THEY DID NOT
288-131220-0017 AND DIAMOND'S CHIEF PLEASURE SEEMED TO BE TO LIE AMONGST THEM AND BREATHE THE PURE AIR BUT ALL THE TIME HE WAS DREAMING OF THE COUNTRY AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND AND TRYING TO RECALL THE SONGS THE RIVER USED TO SING FOR THIS WAS MORE LIKE BEING AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND
288-131220-0018 ALL HE COULD DO WAS TO SING THESE WERE VERY DIFFERENT TIMES FROM THOSE WHEN HE USED TO DRIVE THE CAB BUT YOU MUST NOT SUPPOSE THAT DIAMOND WAS IDLE HE DID NOT DO SO MUCH FOR HIS MOTHER NOW BECAUSE NANNY OCCUPIED HIS FORMER PLACE
288-131220-0019 BUT HE HELPED HIS FATHER STILL BOTH IN THE STABLE AND THE HARNESS ROOM AND GENERALLY WENT WITH HIM ON THE BOX THAT HE MIGHT LEARN TO DRIVE A PAIR AND BE READY TO OPEN THE CARRIAGE DOOR MISTER RAYMOND ADVISED HIS FATHER TO GIVE HIM PLENTY OF LIBERTY
288-131220-0020 A BOY LIKE THAT HE SAID OUGHT NOT TO BE PUSHED JOSEPH ASSENTED HEARTILY
288-131220-0021 AFTER DOING EVERYTHING THAT FELL TO HIS SHARE THE BOY HAD A WEALTH OF TIME AT HIS DISPOSAL AND A HAPPY SOMETIMES A MERRY TIME IT WAS
