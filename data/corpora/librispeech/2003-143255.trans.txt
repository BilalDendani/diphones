2003-143255-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE WE AWAIT OUR FATE I GLANCED FROM THE BLACKS TO THE DOCTOR TO SEE THAT HE WAS INTENTLY GAZING UP THE GORGE WHERE THE RUSHING WATER CAME SEETHING DOWN
2003-143255-0001 AND I READ IN HIS FACE THAT HE COULD NOT SEE THE SLIGHTEST HOPE I LOOKED AT JACK PENNY WHO WAS DEEPLY INTENT UPON A LITTLE BLUE ANCHOR THAT SOME BUSH SHEPHERD HAD TATTOOED UPON HIS THIN WHITE ARM THEN I TURNED TO JIMMY
2003-143255-0002 CAN WE DO ANYTHING DOCTOR I SAID AT LAST IN A LOW AWE STRICKEN VOICE HE GAZED AT ME TENDERLY AND HELD OUT HIS HAND TO PRESS MINE WHEN I LAID IT IN HIS GRASP

2003-143255-0004 BUT I CAN SEE NONE UNLESS THE WATER SINKS WE ARE LOST JOE MY LAD YOU MUST ACT LIKE A MAN I'LL TRY DOCTOR I SAID IN A CHOKING VOICE AND AS I SPOKE

2003-143255-0007 WHEN SO YOUNG AND FULL OF HEALTH AND STRENGTH EVEN IF IT HAD BEEN AMIDST THE ROAR AND TURMOIL OF THE STORM IT WOULD NOT HAVE SEEMED SO BAD OR WHEN THE GREAT FLOOD WAVE CAME DOWN BUT NOW
2003-143255-0008 IN THESE CALM COOL MOMENTS WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING TO EXCITE NOTHING TO STIR THE BLOOD AND ABOVE ALL JUST WHEN THE SKY
2003-143255-0009 WITH A FEW SILVERY CLOUDS FLOATING AWAY IN THE REAR OF THE STORM WHILE THE SUN SHONE DOWN GLORIOUSLY IT SEEMED TOO HARD TO BEAR
2003-143255-0010 AND THEN I JOINED THE DOCTOR IN SEARCHING
2003-143255-0011 AND CLAMBER BEYOND THE REACH OF THE RUSHING TORRENT BUT NO

2003-143255-0019 HE WENT TO THE EDGE OF THE SHELF AND DIPPED ONE FOOT IN THE WATER THEN THE OTHER
2003-143255-0020 AFTER A CONTEMPTUOUS LOOK AT THE BLACKS WHO WERE CALMLY AWAITING THEIR FATE
2003-143255-0021 ABUTMENT AND REACHING UP AS HIGH AS HE COULD BEGAN TO CLIMB IT DID NOT SEEM TO OCCUR TO HIM AT FIRST THAT IF HE WERE ABLE TO ESCAPE NO ONE ELSE WOULD BE AND HE TRIED TWICE
2003-143255-0022 WITH A WONDERFUL DISPLAY OF ACTIVITY WHICH RESULTED MERELY IN HIS SLIPPING BACK THEN HE TRIED ELSEWHERE IN TWO PLACES BUT WITH THE SAME RESULT AND AFTER A FEW MORE TRIALS
2003-143255-0023 HE CAME TO ME AND STOOD RUBBING THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AS IF PUZZLED

2003-143255-0025 CRACKS AND POINTS OF ROCK THAT WE HAD BEFORE NOTICED DISAPPEARING ENTIRELY TILL THE FLOWING EARTH STAINED SURFACE WAS BUT A FEW INCHES BELOW THE LEDGE
2003-143255-0026 WAITING FOR THE TIME WHEN WE SHOULD BE SWEPT AWAY IN SPITE OF THE KNOWLEDGE THAT AT MOST IN AN HOUR THE LEDGE WOULD BE COVERED
2003-143255-0027 FOR MANY AGES AFTER EVERY STORM AND
2003-143255-0028 THE SCOURING OF THE ROCKS MUST HAVE BEEN INCESSANT THEN MY THOUGHTS CAME BACK TO OUR HORRIBLE POSITION
2003-143255-0029 BUT ONLY TO BE SHAMED OUT OF ANY FRANTIC DISPLAY OF GRIEF BY THE STOICAL CALMNESS WITH WHICH ALL SEEMED TO BE PREPARING TO MEET THEIR FATE
2003-143255-0030 STILL THE WATER ROSE STEADILY HIGHER AND HIGHER INCH BY INCH
2003-143255-0031 IT WOULD BE OVER THE LEDGE I WAS NOTING TOO THAT NOW
2003-143255-0032 NEAR THE END MY COMPANIONS SEEMED AVERSE TO SPEAKING TO ME OR EACH OTHER BUT WERE EVIDENTLY MOODY AND THOUGHTFUL ALL BUT JIMMY WHO SEEMED TO BE GETTING EXCITED
2003-143255-0033 I HAD GONE TO THE EXTREME EDGE OF THE LEDGE WHERE THE WATER NEARLY LAPPED MY FEET AND GAZING STRAIGHT UP THE GORGE AT THE SUNLIT WATERS KEPT BACKING SLOWLY UP THE SLOPE DRIVEN AWAY
2003-143255-0034 AS THE RIVER ROSE WHEN THE BLACK CAME TO ME AND TOUCHED MY SHOULDER
2003-143255-0035 NOT DIE YET WHILE JIMMY NOT GO DIE

2003-143255-0040 WHEN NO WATER BIG SWIM MANY HAD BEEN THE TIMES WHEN JIMMY AND I HAD DASHED INTO THE RIVER AND SWUM ABOUT BY THE HOUR TOGETHER
2003-143255-0041 MY SPIRITS ROSE THEN AT THESE THOUGHTS AND I RAPIDLY THREW OFF PART OF MY CLOTHES
2003-143255-0042 IN A NICHE OF THE ROCK WHERE THEIR WEIGHT AND THE SHELTER MIGHT SAVE THEM FROM BEING WASHED AWAY
2003-143255-0043 I SAW THE DOCTOR LOOK UP SADLY BUT ONLY TO LOWER HIS HEAD AGAIN
2003-143255-0044 WHILE JACK PENNY STARED AND DREW HIS KNEES UP TO HIS CHIN EMBRACING HIS LEGS
2003-143255-0045 THE ONLY INDIVIDUAL WHO MADE
2003-143255-0046 AND CAME TO ME WAGGING HIS TAIL AND UTTERING A SHARP BARK OR TWO
2003-143255-0047 SNUFFED AT IT LAPPED A LITTLE AND THREW UP HIS HEAD AGAIN BARKING AND SPLASHING IN IT A LITTLE AS HE RAN IN BREAST HIGH AND CAME BACK AS IF INTIMATING THAT HE WAS
2003-143255-0048 READY AT ANY MOMENT FOR A SWIM THE DOCTOR LOOKED UP NOW
2003-143255-0049 FOR HE ROSE FROM WHERE HE HAD BEEN SEATED AND TOOK MY HAND QUITE RIGHT MY LAD HE SAID ONE MUST NEVER SAY DESPAIR THERE'S A LEDGE
2003-143255-0050 WHERE WE WILL PLACE THE AMMUNITION LET'S KEEP THAT DRY IF WE CAN IT MAY NOT BE TOUCHED BY THE WATER EVEN IF WE HAVE TO SWIM FOR OUR LIVES THE GUNS WON'T HURT THAT IS IF THEY ARE NOT WASHED AWAY
2003-143255-0051 IT WAS AS IF HE HAD PREPARED HIMSELF FOR THE WORST AND WAS NOW GOING TO MAKE STRENUOUS EFFORTS TO SAVE HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS
2003-143255-0052 ABOUT OUR STORES JIMMY GRINNED AND HELPED READILY TO PLACE THE VARIOUS ARTICLES LIKELY TO BE DAMAGED BY
2003-143255-0053 AS HIGH AS WE COULD ON LEDGES AND BLOCKS OF STONE
2003-143255-0054 IT WAS WITH THE FEELING THAT WE WERE NEVER LIKELY TO SEE THE THINGS AGAIN
2003-143255-0055 OF ALL TIMES WAS THE HOUR FOR THAT SO WE WORKED ON WITH MANY A FURTIVE GLANCE AT THE WATER WHICH KEPT ON ENCROACHING TILL IT BEGAN TO LAP THE FEET OF OUR BLACK COMPANIONS
2003-143255-0056 BUT THEY DID NOT STIR THEY REMAINED WITH THEIR POSITIONS UNALTERED AND STILL THE WATER ADVANCED
2003-143255-0057 AND GYP BEGAN WHINING AND PADDLING ABOUT ASKING US AS IT WERE WITH HIS INTELLIGENT EYES WHETHER WE DID NOT MEAN TO START HI GYP GYP SHOUTED JIMMY JUST THEN
2003-143255-0058 UP ALONG BOY UP ALONG AND HE PATTED THE TOP OF ONE OF THE STONES THAT WE HAD USED FOR A BREASTWORK THE DOG LEAPED UP DIRECTLY PLACING HIMSELF THREE FEET ABOVE THE FLOOD AND STOOD
2003-143255-0059 BARKING LOUDLY YES WE CAN STAND UP THERE FOR A WHILE SAID THE DOCTOR AND THAT WILL PROLONG THE STRUGGLE A BIT HERE COME UP HIGHER HE CRIED MAKING SIGNS TO OUR BLACK COMPANIONS
2003-143255-0060 WHO AFTER A TIME CAME UNWILLINGLY FROM THEIR LOWER POSITION SPLASHING MOURNFULLY THROUGH THE WATER BUT EVIDENTLY UNWILLING EVEN THEN TO DISOBEY THEIR WHITE LEADER THEY GROUPED THEMSELVES
2003-143255-0061 WHERE WE STOOD WITH THE WATER RISING STILL HIGHER
2003-143255-0062 FOR A FRESH WAVE THE RESULT PROBABLY OF SOME PORTION OF THE FLOOD THAT HAD BEEN DAMMED UP HIGHER ON THE RIVER COURSE
2003-143255-0063 WE MUST HAVE BEEN BORNE AWAY AS IT WAS WE WERE STANDING BY IT SOME ON EITHER SIDE AND ALL CLINGING TOGETHER WE WITHSTOOD THE HEAVY WRENCH THAT THE WATER SEEMED TO GIVE AND HELD ON
2003-143255-0064 AND WHEN THIS HAD GONE BY THERE WAS
2003-143255-0065 THEN BY DEGREES IT CREPT ON AND ON TILL I WAS STANDING WITH IT REACHING MY HIPS A FEARFUL SILENCE NOW ENSUED AND THE THOUGHT CAME UPON ME
2003-143255-0066 THAT WHEN THE FINAL STRUGGLE WAS AT HAND WE SHOULD BE SO CLASPED TOGETHER THAT SWIMMING WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE AND WE MUST ALL BE DROWNED AND NOW ONCE MORE WITH THE WATER RISING STEADILY
2003-143255-0067 THE OLD STUNNED HELPLESS FEELING BEGAN TO CREEP OVER ME AND I BEGAN TO THINK OF HOME IN A DULL HEAVY MANNER OF THE HAPPY DAYS WHEN I HAD HARDLY A CARE
2003-143255-0068 BUT SOMEHOW I DID NOT FEEL AS IF I REPENTED OF COMING SAVE WHEN I THOUGHT THAT MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE TWO SORROWS NOW WHEN SHE CAME
2003-143255-0069 TO BE NUMBED MY LIMBS BEGAN TO FEEL HELPLESS AND MY THOUGHTS MOVED SLUGGISHLY
2003-143255-0070 HOLDING TIGHTLY BY THE DOCTOR ON ONE SIDE BY JIMMY ON THE OTHER AND IN ANOTHER MINUTE I KNEW THAT THE RISING WATER WOULD BE AT MY LIPS I REMEMBER GIVING A CURIOUS GASP AS IF MY BREATH WAS GOING
2003-143255-0071 AND IN IMAGINATION I RECALLED MY SENSATIONS WHEN DURING A BATHING EXPEDITION I WENT DOWN TWICE BEFORE JIMMY SWAM TO MY HELP AND HELD ME UP
2003-143255-0072 THERE WAS THE OLD PAIN
2003-143255-0073 AND I STRUGGLED TO GET MY HANDS FREE TO BEAT THE WATER LIKE A DROWNING DOG
2003-143255-0074 HOW TIGHTLY PROBABLY THEY NEVER KNEW THEN I REMEMBER THAT MY HEAD SUDDENLY SEEMED TO GROW CLEAR
2003-143255-0075 AS IF I COULD NOT BREATHE THE NEXT MINUTE GYP WAS BARKING FURIOUSLY AS HE STOOD UPON HIS HIND LEGS RESTING HIS PAWS UPON HIS MASTER'S SHOULDERS AND JIMMY GAVE A LOUD SHOUT ALL A WATER RUN AWAY
2003-143255-0076 JUSS FASS NOW AND AS HE SPOKE
2003-143255-0077 WAS TAKEN OFF POUND BY POUND AND BEFORE WE COULD REALISE THE TRUTH THE WATER WAS AT MY KNEES TEN MINUTES LATER IT WAS AT MY FEET AND BEFORE HALF AN HOUR HAD PASSED
2003-143255-0078 DRYING FAST WHILE THE RIVER MINUTE BY MINUTE WAS GOING DOWN SO THAT WE FELT SURE IF NO STORM CAME TO RENEW THE FLOOD IT
2003-143255-0079 AND WARMTH WAS RAPIDLY RESTORED TO OUR LIMBS BY ROCKS THAT SOON GREW HEATED IN THE TORRID RAYS BIG BUNYIP GOT NO MORE WATER ALL GONE DIS TIME SAID JIMMY CALMLY
