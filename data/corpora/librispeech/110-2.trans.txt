110-2-0000 IT IS BUT A GLIMPSE OF THE WORLD OF FASHION
110-2-0001 IT IS NOT SO UNLIKE THE COURT OF CHANCERY BUT THAT WE MAY PASS FROM THE ONE SCENE TO THE OTHER AS THE CROW FLIES BOTH THE WORLD OF FASHION AND THE COURT OF CHANCERY
110-2-0002 ARE THINGS OF PRECEDENT AND USAGE OVERSLEEPING RIP VAN WINKLES WHO HAVE PLAYED AT STRANGE GAMES THROUGH A DEAL OF THUNDERY WEATHER SLEEPING BEAUTIES WHOM THE KNIGHT WILL WAKE ONE DAY
110-2-0003 WHEN ALL THE STOPPED SPITS IN THE KITCHEN SHALL BEGIN TO TURN PRODIGIOUSLY IT IS NOT A LARGE WORLD RELATIVELY EVEN TO THIS WORLD OF OURS WHICH HAS ITS LIMITS TOO
110-2-0004 AND ARE COME TO THE BRINK OF THE VOID BEYOND IT IS A VERY LITTLE SPECK THERE IS MUCH GOOD IN IT THERE ARE MANY GOOD AND TRUE PEOPLE IN IT IT HAS ITS APPOINTED PLACE BUT THE EVIL OF IT IS
110-2-0005 THAT IT IS A WORLD WRAPPED UP IN TOO MUCH JEWELLER'S COTTON AND FINE WOOL AND CANNOT HEAR THE RUSHING OF THE LARGER WORLDS AND CANNOT SEE THEM AS THEY CIRCLE ROUND THE SUN
110-2-0006 IT IS A DEADENED WORLD AND ITS GROWTH IS SOMETIMES UNHEALTHY FOR WANT OF AIR MY LADY DEDLOCK HAS RETURNED TO HER HOUSE IN TOWN FOR A FEW DAYS PREVIOUS TO HER DEPARTURE FOR PARIS
110-2-0007 WHERE HER LADYSHIP INTENDS TO STAY SOME WEEKS AFTER WHICH HER MOVEMENTS ARE UNCERTAIN THE FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE SAYS SO
110-2-0008 AND IT KNOWS ALL FASHIONABLE THINGS TO KNOW THINGS OTHERWISE WERE TO BE UNFASHIONABLE MY LADY DEDLOCK HAS BEEN DOWN AT WHAT SHE CALLS IN FAMILIAR CONVERSATION
110-2-0009 HER PLACE IN LINCOLNSHIRE THE WATERS ARE OUT IN LINCOLNSHIRE AN ARCH OF THE BRIDGE IN THE PARK HAS BEEN SAPPED AND SOPPED AWAY THE ADJACENT LOW LYING GROUND
110-2-0010 FOR HALF A MILE IN BREADTH IS A STAGNANT RIVER WITH MELANCHOLY TREES FOR ISLANDS IN IT AND A SURFACE PUNCTURED ALL OVER ALL DAY LONG WITH FALLING RAIN
110-2-0011 MY LADY DEDLOCK'S PLACE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY DREARY THE WEATHER FOR MANY A DAY AND NIGHT HAS BEEN SO WET THAT THE TREES SEEM WET THROUGH
110-2-0012 AND THE SOFT LOPPINGS AND PRUNINGS OF THE WOODMAN'S AXE CAN MAKE NO CRASH OR CRACKLE AS THEY FALL THE DEER LOOKING SOAKED LEAVE QUAGMIRES WHERE THEY PASS
110-2-0013 AND ITS SMOKE MOVES IN A TARDY LITTLE CLOUD TOWARDS THE GREEN RISE COPPICE TOPPED THAT MAKES A BACKGROUND FOR THE FALLING RAIN THE VIEW FROM MY LADY DEDLOCK'S OWN WINDOWS
110-2-0014 IS ALTERNATELY A LEAD COLOURED VIEW AND A VIEW IN INDIAN INK THE VASES ON THE STONE TERRACE IN THE FOREGROUND CATCH THE RAIN ALL DAY AND THE HEAVY DROPS FALL DRIP DRIP DRIP
110-2-0015 UPON THE BROAD FLAGGED PAVEMENT CALLED FROM OLD TIME THE GHOST'S WALK ALL NIGHT ON SUNDAYS THE LITTLE CHURCH IN THE PARK IS MOULDY
110-2-0016 AND THERE IS A GENERAL SMELL AND TASTE AS OF THE ANCIENT DEDLOCKS IN THEIR GRAVES MY LADY DEDLOCK WHO IS CHILDLESS LOOKING OUT IN THE EARLY TWILIGHT FROM HER BOUDOIR
110-2-0017 AT A KEEPER'S LODGE AND SEEING THE LIGHT OF A FIRE UPON THE LATTICED PANES AND SMOKE RISING FROM THE CHIMNEY AND A CHILD CHASED BY A WOMAN RUNNING OUT INTO THE RAIN
110-2-0018 TO MEET THE SHINING FIGURE OF A WRAPPED UP MAN COMING THROUGH THE GATE HAS BEEN PUT QUITE OUT OF TEMPER MY LADY DEDLOCK SAYS SHE HAS BEEN BORED TO DEATH
110-2-0019 AS THE HOUSEKEEPER HAS PASSED ALONG THE OLD ROOMS SHUTTING UP THE SHUTTERS AND WHEN THEY WILL NEXT COME FORTH AGAIN THE FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE WHICH LIKE THE FIEND
110-2-0020 IS OMNISCIENT OF THE PAST AND PRESENT BUT NOT THE FUTURE CANNOT YET UNDERTAKE TO SAY SIR LEICESTER DEDLOCK IS ONLY A BARONET
110-2-0021 HIS FAMILY IS AS OLD AS THE HILLS AND INFINITELY MORE RESPECTABLE HE HAS A GENERAL OPINION THAT THE WORLD MIGHT GET ON WITHOUT HILLS BUT WOULD BE DONE UP WITHOUT DEDLOCKS
110-2-0022 HE WOULD ON THE WHOLE ADMIT NATURE TO BE A GOOD IDEA A LITTLE LOW PERHAPS WHEN NOT ENCLOSED WITH A PARK FENCE BUT AN IDEA DEPENDENT FOR ITS EXECUTION
110-2-0023 ON YOUR GREAT COUNTY FAMILIES HE IS A GENTLEMAN OF STRICT CONSCIENCE DISDAINFUL OF ALL LITTLENESS AND MEANNESS AND READY ON THE SHORTEST NOTICE TO DIE ANY DEATH YOU MAY PLEASE TO MENTION
110-2-0024 RATHER THAN GIVE OCCASION FOR THE LEAST IMPEACHMENT OF HIS INTEGRITY HE IS AN HONOURABLE OBSTINATE TRUTHFUL HIGH SPIRITED INTENSELY PREJUDICED PERFECTLY UNREASONABLE MAN
110-2-0025 SIR LEICESTER IS TWENTY YEARS FULL MEASURE OLDER THAN MY LADY HE WILL NEVER SEE SIXTY FIVE AGAIN NOR PERHAPS SIXTY SIX NOR YET SIXTY SEVEN
110-2-0026 HE HAS A TWIST OF THE GOUT NOW AND THEN AND WALKS A LITTLE STIFFLY HE IS OF A WORTHY PRESENCE WITH HIS LIGHT GREY HAIR AND WHISKERS HIS FINE SHIRT FRILL
110-2-0027 AND HOLDS HER PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS IN THE HIGHEST ESTIMATION HIS GALLANTRY TO MY LADY WHICH HAS NEVER CHANGED SINCE HE COURTED HER

110-2-0029 WITH ANY MORE BUT SHE HAD BEAUTY PRIDE AMBITION INSOLENT RESOLVE AND SENSE ENOUGH TO PORTION OUT A LEGION OF FINE LADIES WEALTH AND STATION ADDED TO THESE SOON FLOATED HER UPWARD
110-2-0030 AND FOR YEARS NOW MY LADY DEDLOCK HAS BEEN AT THE CENTRE OF THE FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE AND AT THE TOP OF THE FASHIONABLE TREE HOW ALEXANDER WEPT WHEN HE HAD NO MORE WORLDS TO CONQUER
110-2-0031 EVERYBODY KNOWS OR HAS SOME REASON TO KNOW BY THIS TIME THE MATTER HAVING BEEN RATHER FREQUENTLY MENTIONED MY LADY DEDLOCK HAVING CONQUERED HER WORLD FELL NOT INTO THE MELTING BUT RATHER
110-2-0032 INTO THE FREEZING MOOD AN EXHAUSTED COMPOSURE A WORN OUT PLACIDITY AN EQUANIMITY OF FATIGUE NOT TO BE RUFFLED BY INTEREST OR SATISFACTION ARE THE TROPHIES OF HER VICTORY
110-2-0033 SHE IS PERFECTLY WELL BRED IF SHE COULD BE TRANSLATED TO HEAVEN TO MORROW SHE MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO ASCEND WITHOUT ANY RAPTURE SHE HAS BEAUTY STILL
110-2-0034 AND IF IT BE NOT IN ITS HEYDAY IT IS NOT YET IN ITS AUTUMN SHE HAS A FINE FACE ORIGINALLY OF A CHARACTER THAT WOULD BE RATHER CALLED VERY PRETTY THAN HANDSOME
110-2-0035 BUT IMPROVED INTO CLASSICALITY BY THE ACQUIRED EXPRESSION OF HER FASHIONABLE STATE HER FIGURE IS ELEGANT AND HAS THE EFFECT OF BEING TALL NOT THAT SHE IS SO BUT THAT
110-2-0036 THE MOST IS MADE AS THE HONOURABLE BOB STABLES HAS FREQUENTLY ASSERTED UPON OATH OF ALL HER POINTS THE SAME AUTHORITY OBSERVES THAT SHE IS PERFECTLY GOT UP

110-2-0040 WHO HAS THE HONOUR OF ACTING AS LEGAL ADVISER OF THE DEDLOCKS AND HAS AS MANY CAST IRON BOXES IN HIS OFFICE WITH THAT NAME OUTSIDE AS IF THE PRESENT BARONET WERE THE COIN OF THE CONJUROR'S TRICK
110-2-0041 AND WERE CONSTANTLY BEING JUGGLED THROUGH THE WHOLE SET ACROSS THE HALL AND UP THE STAIRS AND ALONG THE PASSAGES AND THROUGH THE ROOMS WHICH ARE VERY BRILLIANT IN THE SEASON AND VERY DISMAL OUT OF IT
110-2-0042 FAIRY LAND TO VISIT BUT A DESERT TO LIVE IN THE OLD GENTLEMAN IS CONDUCTED BY A MERCURY IN POWDER TO MY LADY'S PRESENCE
110-2-0043 THE OLD GENTLEMAN IS RUSTY TO LOOK AT BUT IS REPUTED TO HAVE MADE GOOD THRIFT OUT OF ARISTOCRATIC MARRIAGE SETTLEMENTS AND ARISTOCRATIC WILLS AND TO BE VERY RICH
