5009-29143-0000 THAT IS TO SAY THE TUNNEL HAD REACHED A POINT IN THE HILL WHICH WAS CONSIDERABLY BEYOND WHERE THE COAL VEIN SHOULD PASS ACCORDING TO ALL HIS CALCULATIONS IF THERE WERE A COAL VEIN THERE AND SO EVERY FOOT THAT THE TUNNEL NOW PROGRESSED
5009-29143-0001 SEEMED TO CARRY IT FURTHER AWAY FROM THE OBJECT OF THE SEARCH SOMETIMES HE VENTURED TO HOPE THAT HE HAD MADE A MISTAKE IN ESTIMATING THE DIRECTION WHICH THE VEIN SHOULD NATURALLY TAKE AFTER CROSSING THE VALLEY AND ENTERING THE HILL
5009-29143-0002 UPON SUCH OCCASIONS HE WOULD GO INTO THE NEAREST MINE ON THE VEIN HE WAS HUNTING FOR AND ONCE MORE GET THE BEARINGS OF THE DEPOSIT AND MARK OUT ITS PROBABLE COURSE BUT THE RESULT WAS THE SAME EVERY TIME
5009-29143-0003 HIS TUNNEL HAD MANIFESTLY PIERCED BEYOND THE NATURAL POINT OF JUNCTION AND THEN HIS SPIRITS FELL A LITTLE LOWER HIS MEN HAD ALREADY LOST FAITH
5009-29143-0004 FOREMEN AND LABORERS FROM NEIGHBORING MINES AND NO END OF EXPERIENCED LOAFERS FROM THE VILLAGE VISITED THE TUNNEL FROM TIME TO TIME AND THEIR VERDICTS WERE ALWAYS THE SAME AND ALWAYS DISHEARTENING NO COAL IN THAT HILL
5009-29143-0005 NOW AND THEN PHILIP WOULD SIT DOWN AND THINK IT ALL OVER AND WONDER WHAT THE MYSTERY MEANT THEN HE WOULD GO INTO THE TUNNEL AND ASK THE MEN IF THERE WERE NO SIGNS YET NONE ALWAYS NONE HE WOULD BRING OUT A PIECE OF ROCK AND EXAMINE IT
5009-29143-0006 AND SAY TO HIMSELF IT IS LIMESTONE IT HAS CRINOIDS AND CORALS IN IT THE ROCK IS RIGHT THEN HE WOULD THROW IT DOWN WITH A SIGH AND SAY BUT THAT IS NOTHING WHERE COAL IS
5009-29143-0007 BUT IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY FOLLOW THAT WHERE THIS PECULIAR ROCK IS COAL MUST LIE ABOVE IT OR BEYOND IT THIS SIGN IS NOT SUFFICIENT THE THOUGHT USUALLY FOLLOWED
5009-29143-0008 EVERYBODY CHASES BUTTERFLIES EVERYBODY SEEKS SUDDEN FORTUNE AND WILL NOT LAY ONE UP BY SLOW TOIL THIS IS NOT RIGHT I WILL DISCHARGE THE MEN AND GO AT SOME HONEST WORK THERE IS NO COAL HERE
5009-29143-0009 WHAT A FOOL I HAVE BEEN I WILL GIVE IT UP BUT HE NEVER COULD DO IT
5009-29143-0010 AND AT THE END OF IT HE WAS SURE TO GET UP AND STRAIGHTEN HIMSELF AND SAY THERE IS COAL THERE I WILL NOT GIVE IT UP AND COAL OR NO COAL I WILL DRIVE THE TUNNEL CLEAR THROUGH THE HILL I WILL NOT SURRENDER WHILE I AM ALIVE
5009-29143-0011 HE NEVER THOUGHT OF ASKING MISTER MONTAGUE FOR MORE MONEY HE SAID THERE WAS NOW BUT ONE CHANCE OF FINDING COAL AGAINST NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE THAT HE WOULD NOT FIND IT AND SO IT WOULD BE WRONG IN HIM TO MAKE THE REQUEST
5009-29143-0012 AND FOOLISH IN MISTER MONTAGUE TO GRANT IT HE HAD BEEN WORKING THREE SHIFTS OF MEN FINALLY THE SETTLING OF A WEEKLY ACCOUNT EXHAUSTED HIS MEANS HE COULD NOT AFFORD TO RUN IN DEBT AND THEREFORE HE GAVE THE MEN THEIR DISCHARGE
5009-29143-0013 AND IT WAS A MIGHTY HELP TO HIS FAMILY WHENEVER ANY OF US WAS IN TROUBLE YOU'VE DONE WHAT YOU COULD TO HELP US OUT YOU'VE ACTED FAIR AND SQUARE WITH US EVERY TIME AND I RECKON WE ARE MEN AND KNOW A MAN WHEN WE SEE HIM WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY FAITH IN THAT HILL
5009-29143-0014 BUT WE HAVE A RESPECT FOR A MAN THAT'S GOT THE PLUCK THAT YOU'VE SHOWED YOU'VE FOUGHT A GOOD FIGHT WITH EVERYBODY AGIN YOU
5009-29143-0015 THAT IS WHAT THE BOYS SAY NOW WE WANT TO PUT IN ONE PARTING BLAST FOR LUCK
5009-29143-0016 WE WON'T BRING IN NO BILL AGAINST YOU THAT IS WHAT WE'VE COME TO SAY PHILIP WAS TOUCHED IF HE HAD HAD MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY THREE DAYS GRUB HE WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED THE GENEROUS OFFER
5009-29143-0017 BUT AS IT WAS HE COULD NOT CONSENT TO BE LESS MAGNANIMOUS THAN THE MEN AND SO HE DECLINED IN A MANLY SPEECH SHOOK HANDS ALL AROUND AND RESUMED HIS SOLITARY COMMUNINGS THE MEN WENT BACK TO THE TUNNEL
5009-29143-0018 AND PUT IN A PARTING BLAST FOR LUCK ANYHOW THEY DID A FULL DAY'S WORK AND THEN TOOK THEIR LEAVE THEY CALLED AT HIS CABIN AND GAVE HIM GOOD BYE BUT WERE NOT ABLE TO TELL HIM THEIR DAY'S EFFORT HAD GIVEN THINGS A MERE PROMISING LOOK
5009-29143-0019 THE NEXT DAY PHILIP SOLD ALL THE TOOLS BUT TWO OR THREE SETS HE ALSO SOLD ONE OF THE NOW DESERTED CABINS AS OLD LUMBER TOGETHER WITH ITS DOMESTIC WARES
5009-29143-0020 AND MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD BUY PROVISIONS WITH THE TRIFLE OF MONEY THUS GAINED AND CONTINUE HIS WORK ALONE ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON HE PUT ON HIS ROUGHEST CLOTHES AND WENT TO THE TUNNEL HE LIT A CANDLE AND GROPED HIS WAY IN
5009-29143-0021 PRESENTLY HE HEARD THE SOUND OF A PICK OR A DRILL AND WONDERED WHAT IT MEANT A SPARK OF LIGHT NOW APPEARED IN THE FAR END OF THE TUNNEL AND WHEN HE ARRIVED THERE HE FOUND THE MAN TIM AT WORK
5009-29143-0022 TIM SAID I'M TO HAVE A JOB IN THE GOLDEN BRIER MINE BY AND BY IN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS AND I'M GOING TO WORK HERE TILL THEN A MAN MIGHT AS WELL BE AT SOME THING AND BESIDES I CONSIDER THAT I OWE YOU WHAT YOU PAID ME WHEN I WAS LAID UP
5009-29143-0023 PHILIP SAID OH NO HE DIDN'T OWE ANYTHING BUT TIM PERSISTED AND THEN PHILIP SAID HE HAD A LITTLE PROVISION NOW AND WOULD SHARE SO FOR SEVERAL DAYS PHILIP HELD THE DRILL AND TIM DID THE STRIKING
5009-29143-0024 AT FIRST PHILIP WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE THE RESULT OF EVERY BLAST AND WAS ALWAYS BACK AND PEERING AMONG THE SMOKE THE MOMENT AFTER THE EXPLOSION BUT THERE WAS NEVER ANY ENCOURAGING RESULT AND THEREFORE HE FINALLY LOST ALMOST ALL INTEREST
5009-29143-0025 AND HARDLY TROUBLED HIMSELF TO INSPECT RESULTS AT ALL HE SIMPLY LABORED ON STUBBORNLY AND WITH LITTLE HOPE TIM STAID WITH HIM TILL THE LAST MOMENT AND THEN TOOK UP HIS JOB AT THE GOLDEN BRIER
5009-29143-0026 APPARENTLY AS DEPRESSED BY THE CONTINUED BARRENNESS OF THEIR MUTUAL LABORS AS PHILIP WAS HIMSELF AFTER THAT PHILIP FOUGHT HIS BATTLE ALONE DAY AFTER DAY AND SLOW WORK IT WAS HE COULD SCARCELY SEE THAT HE MADE ANY PROGRESS
5009-29143-0027 LATE ONE AFTERNOON HE FINISHED DRILLING A HOLE WHICH HE HAD BEEN AT WORK AT FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS HE SWABBED IT OUT AND POURED IN THE POWDER AND INSERTED THE FUSE THEN FILLED UP THE REST OF THE HOLE WITH DIRT AND SMALL FRAGMENTS OF STONE TAMPED IT DOWN FIRMLY
5009-29143-0028 TOUCHED HIS CANDLE TO THE FUSE AND RAN BY AND BY THE DULL REPORT CAME AND HE WAS ABOUT TO WALK BACK MECHANICALLY AND SEE WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED BUT HE HALTED PRESENTLY TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND THOUGHT RATHER THAN SAID NO THIS IS USELESS
5009-29143-0029 THIS IS ABSURD IF I FOUND ANYTHING IT WOULD ONLY BE ONE OF THOSE LITTLE AGGRAVATING SEAMS OF COAL WHICH DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING AND BY THIS TIME HE WAS WALKING OUT OF THE TUNNEL HIS THOUGHT RAN ON
5009-29143-0030 I WILL GO AND WORK FOR MONEY AND COME BACK AND HAVE ANOTHER FIGHT WITH FATE AH ME IT MAY BE YEARS IT MAY BE YEARS ARRIVED AT THE MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL HE THREW HIS COAT UPON THE GROUND SAT DOWN ON A STONE AND HIS EYE SOUGHT THE WESTERING SUN
5009-29143-0031 AND DWELT UPON THE CHARMING LANDSCAPE WHICH STRETCHED ITS WOODY RIDGES WAVE UPON WAVE TO THE GOLDEN HORIZON SOMETHING WAS TAKING PLACE AT HIS FEET WHICH DID NOT ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION
5009-29143-0032 HIS REVERIE CONTINUED AND ITS BURDEN GREW MORE AND MORE GLOOMY PRESENTLY HE ROSE UP AND CAST A LOOK FAR AWAY TOWARD THE VALLEY AND HIS THOUGHTS TOOK A NEW DIRECTION THERE IT IS HOW GOOD IT LOOKS
5009-29143-0033 BUT HE SMILED AT THE THOUGHT AND CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY SUCH A COAT AS THAT COULD BE OF LITTLE USE IN A CIVILIZED LAND A LITTLE FURTHER ON HE REMEMBERED THAT THERE WERE SOME PAPERS OF VALUE IN ONE OF THE POCKETS OF THE RELIC
5009-29143-0034 AND THEN WITH A PENITENT EJACULATION HE TURNED BACK PICKED UP THE COAT AND PUT IT ON
5009-29143-0035 HE STOOD STILL A MOMENT AS ONE WHO IS TRYING TO BELIEVE SOMETHING AND CANNOT HE PUT A HAND UP OVER HIS SHOULDER AND FELT HIS BACK AND A GREAT THRILL SHOT THROUGH HIM HE GRASPED THE SKIRT OF THE COAT IMPULSIVELY
5009-29143-0036 AND ANOTHER THRILL FOLLOWED HE SNATCHED THE COAT FROM HIS BACK GLANCED AT IT THREW IT FROM HIM AND FLEW BACK TO THE TUNNEL HE SOUGHT THE SPOT WHERE THE COAT HAD LAIN HE HAD TO LOOK CLOSE FOR THE LIGHT WAS WANING
5009-29143-0037 THEN TO MAKE SURE HE PUT HIS HAND TO THE GROUND AND A LITTLE STREAM OF WATER SWEPT AGAINST HIS FINGERS THANK GOD I'VE STRUCK IT AT LAST HE LIT A CANDLE AND RAN INTO THE TUNNEL
5009-29143-0038 HE PICKED UP A PIECE OF RUBBISH CAST OUT BY THE LAST BLAST AND SAID THIS CLAYEY STUFF IS WHAT I'VE LONGED FOR I KNOW WHAT IS BEHIND IT HE SWUNG HIS PICK WITH HEARTY GOOD WILL TILL LONG AFTER THE DARKNESS HAD GATHERED UPON THE EARTH
5009-29143-0039 AND WHEN HE TRUDGED HOME AT LENGTH HE KNEW HE HAD A COAL VEIN AND THAT IT WAS SEVEN FEET THICK FROM WALL TO WALL HE FOUND A YELLOW ENVELOPE LYING ON HIS RICKETY TABLE
5009-29143-0040 AND RECOGNIZED THAT IT WAS OF A FAMILY SACRED TO THE TRANSMISSION OF TELEGRAMS HE OPENED IT READ IT CRUSHED IT IN HIS HAND AND THREW IT DOWN IT SIMPLY SAID
