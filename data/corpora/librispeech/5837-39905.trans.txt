5837-39905-0000 THE MORNING SUN HUNG A RED LUSTRELESS BALL IN THE DULL GREY SKY A LIGHT SNOW HAD FALLEN IN THE NIGHT AND THE LANDSCAPE CROSSED BY SPIDER LIKE TRAILS OF FENCES
5837-39905-0001 WAS AS WHITE AND LIFELESS AS IF WRAPPED IN A SHROUD A YOUNG MAN WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD TO RYKMAN'S CORNER THE YOUTHFUL FACE VISIBLE ABOVE THE GREATCOAT WAS THOUGHTFUL AND REFINED
5837-39905-0002 THE EYES DEEP BLUE AND PECULIARLY BEAUTIFUL THE MOUTH FIRM YET SENSITIVE IT WAS NOT A HANDSOME FACE BUT THERE WAS A STRANGELY SUBTLE CHARM ABOUT IT
5837-39905-0003 THE CHILL BREATHLESSNESS OF THE AIR SEEMED PROPHETIC OF MORE SNOW THE REVEREND ALLAN TELFORD LOOKED ACROSS THE BARE WASTES AND COLD WHITE HILLS AND SHIVERED AS IF THE ICY LIFELESSNESS ABOUT HIM WERE SLOWLY
5837-39905-0004 AND RELENTLESSLY CREEPING INTO HIS OWN HEART AND LIFE HE FELT UTTERLY DISCOURAGED IN HIS SOUL HE WAS ASKING BITTERLY WHAT GOOD HAD COME
5837-39905-0005 OF ALL HIS PRAYERFUL LABOURS AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THIS PINCHED NARROW WORLD AS RUGGED AND UNBEAUTIFUL IN FORM AND LIFE AS THE BARREN HILLS THAT SHUT THEM IN HE HAD BEEN TWO YEARS AMONG THEM AND HE COUNTED IT TWO YEARS OF FAILURE
5837-39905-0006 HE HAD BEEN TOO OUTSPOKEN FOR THEM THEY RESENTED SULLENLY HIS DIRECT AND INCISIVE TIRADES AGAINST THEIR PET SINS THEY VIEWED HIS SMALL INNOVATIONS ON THEIR TRADITIONAL WAYS OF WORSHIP WITH DISFAVOUR AND DISTRUST
5837-39905-0007 HE HAD MEANT WELL AND WORKED HARD AND HE FELT HIS FAILURE KEENLY HIS THOUGHTS REVERTED TO A LETTER RECEIVED THE PRECEDING DAY FROM A FORMER CLASSMATE STATING THAT THE PASTORATE OF A CERTAIN DESIRABLE TOWN CHURCH HAD BECOME VACANT
5837-39905-0008 AND HINTING THAT A CALL WAS TO BE MODERATED FOR HIM UNLESS HE SIGNIFIED HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT TWO YEARS BEFORE ALLAN TELFORD FRESH FROM COLLEGE AND FULL OF VIGOROUS ENTHUSIASM AND HIGH IDEAS WOULD HAVE SAID NO THAT IS NOT FOR ME
5837-39905-0009 MY WORK MUST LIE AMONG THE POOR AND LOWLY OF EARTH AS DID MY MASTER'S SHALL I SHRINK FROM IT BECAUSE TO WORLDLY EYES THE WAY LOOKS DREARY AND UNINVITING NOW LOOKING BACK ON HIS TWO YEARS MINISTRY HE SAID WEARILY
5837-39905-0010 I CAN REMAIN HERE NO LONGER IF I DO I FEAR I SHALL SINK DOWN INTO SOMETHING ALMOST AS PITIFUL AS ONE OF THESE CANTING GOSSIPING PEOPLE MYSELF I CAN DO THEM NO GOOD THEY DO NOT LIKE OR TRUST ME
5837-39905-0011 I WILL ACCEPT THIS CALL AND GO BACK TO MY OWN WORLD PERHAPS THE KEYNOTE OF HIS FAILURE WAS SOUNDED IN HIS LAST WORDS MY OWN WORLD HE HAD NEVER FELT
5837-39905-0012 OR TRIED TO FEEL THAT THIS NARROW SPHERE WAS HIS OWN WORLD IT WAS SOME LOWER LEVEL TO WHICH HE HAD COME WITH GOOD TIDINGS AND HONEST INTENTIONS BUT UNCONSCIOUSLY HE HAD HELD HIMSELF ABOVE IT AND HIS PEOPLE FELT AND RESENTED THIS THEY EXPRESSED IT BY SAYING
5837-39905-0013 HE WAS STUCK UP RYKMAN'S CORNER CAME INTO VIEW AS HE DROVE OVER THE BROW OF A LONG HILL HE HATED THE PLACE KNOWING IT WELL FOR WHAT IT WAS A FESTERING HOTBED OF GOSSIP AND MALICE
5837-39905-0014 THE HABITAT OF ALL THE SLANDEROUS RUMOURS AND INNUENDOES THAT PERMEATED THE SOCIAL TISSUE OF THE COMMUNITY THE NEWEST SCANDAL THE WORST FLAVOURED JOKE
5837-39905-0015 THE LATEST DETAILS OF THE MOST RECENT QUARREL WERE ALWAYS TO BE HAD AT RYKMAN'S STORE AS THE MINISTER DROVE DOWN THE HILL A MAN CAME OUT OF A SMALL HOUSE AT THE FOOT AND WAITED ON THE ROAD
5837-39905-0016 MEANT TO BE SEEN AND HAILED THE MINISTER CHEERFULLY GOOD MORNIN MISTER TELFORD
5837-39905-0017 TELFORD CHECKED HIS HORSE RELUCTANTLY AND GALLETLY CRAWLED INTO THE CUTTER HE WAS THAT MOST DESPICABLE OF CREATED BEINGS A MALE GOSSIP
5837-39905-0018 SMOKING HIS PIPE IN NEIGHBOURLY KITCHENS AND FANNING INTO AN ACTIVE BLAZE ALL THE SMOULDERING FEUDS OF THE PLACE HE HAD BEEN NICKNAMED THE MORNING CHRONICLE BY A SARCASTIC SCHOOLTEACHER WHO HAD SOJOURNED A WINTER AT THE CORNER
5837-39905-0019 THE NAME WAS AN APT ONE AND CLUNG TELFORD HAD HEARD IT
5837-39905-0020 QUITE A FALL OF SNOW LAST NIGHT RECKON WE'LL HAVE MORE FORE LONG THAT WAS A GRAND SERMON YE GAVE US LAST SUNDAY MISTER TELFORD
5837-39905-0021 HOME TO SOME FOLKS JUDGIN FROM ALL I'VE HEARD IT WAS NEEDED AND THAT'S A FACT LIVE PEACEABLY WITH ALL MEN' THAT'S WHAT I LAY OUT TO DO THERE AIN'T A HOUSE IN THE DISTRICT BUT WHAT I CAN DROP INTO AND WELCOME TAIN'T EVERYBODY IN RYKMAN'S CORNER CAN SAY THE SAME
5837-39905-0022 TELFORD'S PASSIVE FACE WAS DISCOURAGING BUT GALLETLY WAS NOT TO BE BAFFLED
5837-39905-0023 TELFORD WAS VAINLY SEEKING TO NIP GALLETLY'S GOSSIP IN THE BUD THE NAME OF PALMER CONVEYED NO ESPECIAL MEANING TO HIS EAR
5837-39905-0024 WHOSE NAME WAS MISSUS FULLER AND WHO CAME TO CHURCH OCCASIONALLY LIVED THERE HIS KNOWLEDGE WENT NO FURTHER HE HAD CALLED THREE TIMES AND FOUND NOBODY AT HOME AT LEAST TO ALL APPEARANCES
5837-39905-0025 NOW HE WAS FATED TO HAVE THE WHOLE BUDGET OF SOME VULGAR QUARREL FORCED ON HIM BY GALLETLY NO EVERYONE'S TALKIN OF IT
5837-39905-0026 I BELIEVE THE TWO WOMEN HAD AN AWFUL TIME MIN'S A TARTAR WHEN HER TEMPER'S UP AND THAT'S PRETTY OFTEN
5837-39905-0027 BUT SHE HAS HAD TO GO AT LAST GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT THE POOR CRITTER'LL DO SHE HASN'T A CENT NOR A RELATION SHE WAS JUST AN ORPHAN GIRL THAT PALMER BROUGHT UP SHE IS AT RAWLINGSES NOW
5837-39905-0028 MAYBE WHEN MIN COOLS OFF SHE'LL LET HER GO BACK BUT IT'S DOUBTFUL MIN HATES HER LIKE P'ISEN TO TELFORD THIS WAS ALL VERY UNINTELLIGIBLE
5837-39905-0029 BUT HE UNDERSTOOD THAT MISSUS FULLER WAS IN TROUBLE OF SOME KIND AND THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO HELP HER IF POSSIBLE
5837-39905-0030 FOR WHICH HE HAD OFTEN REPROACHED HIMSELF WHO IS THIS WOMAN YOU CALL MIN PALMER HE SAID COLDLY WHAT ARE THE FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES
5837-39905-0031 BUT I HAVE NO WISH TO HEAR IDLE GOSSIP HIS CONCLUDING SENTENCE WAS QUITE UNHEEDED BY GALLETLY MIN PALMER'S THE WORST WOMAN IN RYKMAN'S CORNER OR OUT OF IT SHE ALWAYS WAS AN ODD ONE
5837-39905-0032 I MIND HER WHEN SHE WAS A GIRL A SAUCY BLACK EYED BAGGAGE SHE WAS HANDSOME SOME FOLKS CALLED HER
5837-39905-0033 JEST LET RUN WILD ALL HER LIFE WELL ROD PALMER TOOK TO DANCIN ATTENDANCE ON HER ROD WAS A WORTHLESS SCAMP OLD PALMER WAS WELL OFF AND ROD WAS HIS ONLY CHILD BUT THIS ROSE LIVED THERE AND KEPT HOUSE FOR THEM AFTER MIS PALMER DIED
5837-39905-0034 SHE WAS A QUIET WELL BEHAVED LITTLE CREETUR FOLKS SAID THE OLD MAN WANTED ROD TO MARRY HER
5837-39905-0035 IN THE END HOWSOMEVER HE HAD TO MARRY MIN HER BROTHER GOT AFTER HIM WITH A HORSE WHIP YE UNDERSTAND OLD PALMER WAS FURIOUS BUT HE HAD TO GIVE IN AND ROD BROUGHT HER HOME SHE WAS A BIT SOBERED DOWN BY HER TROUBLE
5837-39905-0036 HER AND ROD FOUGHT LIKE CAT AND DOG ROSE MARRIED OSH FULLER A WORTHLESS DRUNKEN FELLOW HE DIED IN A YEAR OR SO AND LEFT ROSE AND HER BABY WITHOUT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS THEN OLD PALMER WENT AND BROUGHT HER HOME
5837-39905-0037 MIN HAD TO BE CIVIL TO ROSE AS LONG AS OLD PALMER LIVED
5837-39905-0038 THEN THE QUEER PART CAME IN
5837-39905-0039 I MAY HAVE MY OWN SECRET OPINION OF COURSE OLD PALMER HAD A REGULAR MANIA AS YE MIGHT SAY FOR MAKIN WILLS
5837-39905-0040 LAWYER BELL WAS THERE AND MADE ONE BOUT EIGHT MONTHS FORE HE DIED
5837-39905-0041 HE WENT OFF AWFUL SUDDEN ANYWAY EVERYTHING WENT TO MIN'S CHILD TO MIN AS YE MIGHT SAY SHE'S BEEN BOSS
5837-39905-0042 MIN'S IN ONE OF HER TANTRUMS NOW AND TAIN'T SAFE TO CROSS HER PATH WHAT IS MISSUS FULLER TO DO ASKED TELFORD ANXIOUSLY THAT'S THE QUESTION SHE'S SICKLY CAN'T WORK MUCH AND THEN SHE HAS HER LEETLE GAL
5837-39905-0043 MIN'S OWN IS AN AWFUL LOOKING THING A CRIPPLE FROM THE TIME TWAS BORN
5837-39905-0044 IN SPITE OF HIS DISGUST
5837-39905-0045 THIS MIN PALMER MUST AT LEAST BE DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE CORNERITES IF ONLY IN THE GREATER FORCE OF HER WICKEDNESS
5837-39905-0046 GALLETLY EAGERLY JOINED THE GROUP OF LOUNGERS ON THE DIRTY WET PLATFORM AND TELFORD PASSED INTO THE STORE A COUPLE OF SLATTERNLY WOMEN WERE TALKING TO MISSUS RYKMAN ABOUT THE PALMER ROW
5837-39905-0047 TELFORD MADE HIS SMALL PURCHASES HASTILY AS HE TURNED FROM THE COUNTER HE CAME FACE TO FACE WITH A WOMAN WHO HAD PAUSED IN THE DOORWAY TO SURVEY THE SCENE WITH AN AIR OF SULLEN SCORN
5837-39905-0048 BY SOME SUBTLE INTUITION TELFORD KNEW THAT THIS WAS MIN PALMER THE YOUNG MAN'S FIRST FEELING WAS ONE OF ADMIRATION FOR THE WOMAN BEFORE HIM WHO IN SPITE OF HER GROTESQUE ATTIRE AND DEFIANT UNWOMANLY AIR
5837-39905-0049 WAS STRIKINGLY BEAUTIFUL SHE WAS TALL AND NOT EVEN THE MAN'S RAGGED OVERCOAT WHICH SHE WORE COULD CONCEAL THE GRACE OF HER FIGURE HER ABUNDANT BLACK HAIR WAS TWISTED INTO A SAGGING KNOT AT HER NECK
5837-39905-0050 AND FROM BENEATH THE OLD FUR CAP LOOKED OUT A PAIR OF LARGE AND BRILLIANT BLACK EYES HEAVILY LASHED AND FULL OF A SMOULDERING FIRE
5837-39905-0051 HER SKIN WAS TANNED AND COARSENED BUT THE WARM CRIMSON BLOOD GLOWED IN HER CHEEKS WITH A DUSKY RICHNESS AND HER FACE WAS A PERFECT OVAL WITH FEATURES CHISELLED IN ALMOST CLASSIC REGULARITY OF OUTLINE
5837-39905-0052 TELFORD HAD A CURIOUS EXPERIENCE AT THAT MOMENT HE SEEMED TO SEE LOOKING OUT FROM BEHIND THIS EXTERNAL MASK OF DEGRADED BEAUTY THE SEMBLANCE OF WHAT THIS WOMAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNDER MORE FAVOURING CIRCUMSTANCE OF BIRTH AND ENVIRONMENT
5837-39905-0053 WHEREIN HER RICH PASSIONATE NATURE POTENT FOR EITHER GOOD OR EVIL MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRAINED AND SWAYED ARIGHT UNTIL IT HAD DEVELOPED GRANDLY OUT INTO THE GLORIOUS WOMANHOOD THE CREATOR MUST HAVE PLANNED FOR HER
5837-39905-0054 HE KNEW AS IF BY REVELATION THAT THIS WOMAN HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE NARROW SELF RIGHTEOUS SOULS OF RYKMAN'S CORNER WARPED AND PERVERTED THOUGH HER NATURE MIGHT BE
5837-39905-0055 SHE WAS YET FAR NOBLER THAN THOSE WHO SAT IN JUDGEMENT UPON HER MIN MADE SOME SCANTY PURCHASES AND LEFT THE STORE QUICKLY BRUSHING UNHEEDINGLY PAST THE MINISTER AS SHE DID SO
5837-39905-0056 AND DRIVE DOWN THE RIVER ROAD THE PLATFORM LOUNGERS HAD BEEN SILENT DURING HER CALL BUT NOW THE TALK BUBBLED FORTH ANEW TELFORD WAS SICK AT HEART AS HE DROVE SWIFTLY AWAY HE FELT FOR MIN PALMER A PITY HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND OR ANALYZE
5837-39905-0057 THE ATTEMPT TO MEASURE THE GULF BETWEEN WHAT SHE WAS AND WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HURT HIM LIKE THE STAB OF A KNIFE HE MADE SEVERAL CALLS AT VARIOUS HOUSES ALONG THE RIVER DURING THE FORENOON AFTER DINNER HE SUDDENLY TURNED HIS HORSE TOWARDS THE PALMER PLACE
5837-39905-0058 COMFORTABLY CURLED UP IN A NEIGHBOUR'S CHIMNEY CORNER SAW HIM DRIVE PAST EF THE MINISTER AIN'T GOIN TO PALMERS AFTER ALL HE CHUCKLED
5837-39905-0059 TELFORD WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS OWN MISGIVINGS AS HE DROVE INTO THE PALMER YARD HE TIED HIS HORSE TO THE FENCE AND LOOKED DOUBTFULLY ABOUT HIM UNTRODDEN SNOWDRIFTS WERE HEAPED ABOUT THE FRONT DOOR
5837-39905-0060 SO HE TURNED TOWARDS THE KITCHEN AND WALKED SLOWLY PAST THE BARE LILAC TREES ALONG THE FENCE THERE WAS NO SIGN OF LIFE ABOUT THE PLACE IT WAS BEGINNING TO SNOW AGAIN SOFTLY AND THICKLY AND THE HILLS AND RIVER WERE HIDDEN BEHIND A MISTY WHITE VEIL
5837-39905-0061 HE LIFTED HIS HAND TO KNOCK BUT BEFORE HE COULD DO SO THE DOOR WAS FLUNG OPEN AND MIN HERSELF CONFRONTED HIM ON THE THRESHOLD SHE DID NOT NOW HAVE ON THE MAN'S OVERCOAT WHICH SHE HAD WORN AT THE STORE
5837-39905-0062 AND HER NEAT CLOSE FITTING HOME SPUN DRESS REVEALED TO PERFECTION THE FULL MAGNIFICENT CURVES OF HER FIGURE HER SPLENDID HAIR WAS BRAIDED ABOUT HER HEAD IN A GLOSSY CORONET AND HER DARK EYES WERE
5837-39905-0063 ABLAZE WITH ILL SUPPRESSED ANGER AGAIN TELFORD WAS OVERCOME BY A SENSE OF HER WONDERFUL LOVELINESS NOT ALL THE YEARS OF BONDAGE TO ILL TEMPER AND MISGUIDED WILL HAD BEEN ABLE TO BLOT OUT THE BEAUTY OF THAT PROUD DARK FACE
5837-39905-0064 SHE LIFTED ONE LARGE BUT SHAPELY BROWN HAND AND POINTED TO THE GATE GO SHE SAID THREATENINGLY MISSUS PALMER BEGAN TELFORD BUT SHE SILENCED HIM WITH AN IMPERIOUS GESTURE I DON'T WANT ANY OF YOUR KIND HERE
5837-39905-0065 I HATE ALL YOU MINISTERS DID YOU COME HERE TO LECTURE ME I SUPPOSE SOME OF THE CORNER SAINTS SET
5837-39905-0066 TELFORD RETURNED HER DEFIANT GAZE UNFLINCHINGLY HIS DARK BLUE EYES MAGNETIC IN THEIR POWER AND SWEETNESS LOOKED GRAVELY QUESTIONINGLY INTO MIN'S STORMY ORBS
5837-39905-0067 SLOWLY THE FIRE AND ANGER FADED OUT OF HER FACE AND HER HEAD DROOPED
5837-39905-0068 THE CORNER SAINTS SAY I'M POSSESSED OF THE DEVIL PERHAPS I AM IF THERE IS ONE I DO MEAN WELL SAID TELFORD SLOWLY
5837-39905-0069 I CAME TO HELP YOU IF I COULD
5837-39905-0070 DON'T CALL ME THAT SHE INTERRUPTED PASSIONATELY SHE FLUNG OUT HER HANDS AS IF PUSHING SOME LOATHLY INVISIBLE THING FROM HER I HATE THE NAME AS I HATED ALL WHO EVER BORE IT
5837-39905-0071 I NEVER HAD ANYTHING BUT WRONG AND DOG USAGE FROM THEM ALL CALL ME MIN THAT'S THE ONLY NAME THAT BELONGS TO ME NOW GO WHY DON'T YOU GO
5837-39905-0072 I'VE BEEN WELL SICKENED OF THAT GO TELFORD THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND LOOKED ONCE MORE INTO HER EYES A LONG LOOK PASSED BETWEEN THEM THEN HE SILENTLY LIFTED HIS CAP AND WITH NO WORD OF FAREWELL
5837-39905-0073 HE TURNED AND WENT DOWN TO THE GATE A BITTER SENSE OF DEFEAT AND DISAPPOINTMENT FILLED HIS HEART AS HE DROVE AWAY MIN STOOD IN THE DOORWAY AND WATCHED THE SLEIGH OUT OF SIGHT DOWN THE RIVER ROAD
5837-39905-0074 THEN SHE GAVE A LONG SHIVERING SIGH THAT WAS ALMOST A MOAN IF I HAD MET THAT MAN LONG AGO
5837-39905-0075 I WOULD NEVER HAVE BECOME WHAT I AM I FELT THAT AS I LOOKED AT HIM IT ALL CAME OVER ME WITH AN AWFUL SICKENING FEELING
5837-39905-0076 JUST AS IF WE WERE STANDING ALONE SOMEWHERE OUT OF THE WORLD WHERE THERE WAS NO NEED OF WORDS TO SAY THINGS HE DOESN'T DESPISE ME
5837-39905-0077 IF WE HAD MET IN TIME BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW SHE LOCKED HER HANDS OVER HER EYES AND GROANED SWAYING HER BODY TO AND FRO AS ONE IN MORTAL AGONY PRESENTLY SHE LOOKED OUT AGAIN WITH HARD DRY EYES
5837-39905-0078 WHAT A FOOL I AM SHE SAID BITTERLY HOW THE CORNER SAINTS WOULD STARE IF THEY SAW ME I SUPPOSE SOME OF THEM DO
5837-39905-0079 HER FACE HARDENED THE OLD SWAY OF EVIL PASSION REASSERTED ITSELF SHE SHALL NEVER COME BACK HERE NEVER OH SHE WAS A SWEET SPOKEN CAT OF A THING BUT SHE HAD CLAWS I'VE BEEN BLAMED FOR ALL THE TROUBLE
5837-39905-0080 I'D TELL THAT MINISTER HOW SHE USED TO TWIT AND TAUNT ME IN THAT SUGARY WAY OF HERS
5837-39905-0081 MORE FOOL I TO CARE WHAT HE THINKS EITHER I WISH I WERE DEAD
5837-39905-0082 I'D BE WELL OUT OF THE WAY IT WAS A DULL GREY AFTERNOON A WEEK AFTERWARDS WHEN ALLAN TELFORD AGAIN WALKED UP THE RIVER ROAD TO THE PALMER PLACE THE WIND WAS BITTER AND HE WALKED WITH BENT HEAD TO AVOID ITS FURY
5837-39905-0083 HIS FACE WAS PALE AND WORN AND HE LOOKED YEARS OLDER
5837-39905-0084 AS HE LOOKED THE KITCHEN DOOR OPENED AND MIN CLAD IN THE OLD OVERCOAT CAME OUT AND WALKED SWIFTLY ACROSS THE YARD TELFORD'S EYES FOLLOWED HER WITH PITIFUL ABSORPTION
5837-39905-0085 HE SAW HER LEAD A HORSE FROM THE STABLE AND HARNESS IT INTO A WOOD SLEIGH LOADED WITH BAGS OF GRAIN
5837-39905-0086 LAYING HER FACE AGAINST IT WITH A CARESSING MOTION THE PALE MINISTER GROANED ALOUD HE LONGED TO SNATCH HER FOREVER FROM THAT HARD UNWOMANLY TOIL AND FOLD HER SAFELY AWAY FROM JEERS AND SCORN IN THE SHELTER OF HIS LOVE
5837-39905-0087 HE KNEW IT WAS MADNESS HE HAD TOLD HIMSELF SO EVERY HOUR IN WHICH MIN'S DARK REBELLIOUS FACE HAD HAUNTED HIM YET NONE THE LESS WAS HE UNDER ITS CONTROL
5837-39905-0088 MIN LED THE HORSE ACROSS THE YARD AND LEFT IT STANDING BEFORE THE KITCHEN DOOR SHE HAD NOT SEEN THE BOWED FIGURE AT THE GATE WHEN SHE REAPPEARED
5837-39905-0089 AS SHE CAUGHT THE HORSE BY THE BRIDLE THE KITCHEN DOOR SWUNG HEAVILY TO WITH A SHARP SUDDEN BANG THE HORSE A GREAT POWERFUL NERVOUS BRUTE STARTED WILDLY AND THEN REARED IN TERROR THE ICE UNDERFOOT WAS GLIB AND TREACHEROUS
5837-39905-0090 MIN LOST HER FOOTHOLD AND FELL DIRECTLY UNDER THE HORSE'S HOOFS AS THEY CAME HEAVILY DOWN THE ANIMAL FREED FROM HER DETAINING HAND SPRANG FORWARD DRAGGING THE LADEN SLEIGH OVER THE PROSTRATE WOMAN
