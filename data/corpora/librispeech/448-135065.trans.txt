448-135065-0016 IF I WOULD GET THE KEY OF OUR ROOM AND LET HER OUT BUT I TOLD HER SHE HAD NOTHING TO GIVE THEY WERE ALL ALL MINE AND THEN SHE CRIED AND TOOK A LITTLE PICTURE FROM HER NECK AND SAID I SHOULD HAVE THAT TWO PICTURES IN A GOLD CASE

448-135065-0020 I WINK TO SEE MY FATHER STRIKE A DOG OR A HORSE HE DOES IT SO HARD YET I WAS GLAD AT FIRST SHE DESERVED PUNISHING FOR PUSHING ME BUT WHEN PAPA WAS GONE
448-135065-0021 AND HER MOUTH FILLING WITH BLOOD AND THEN SHE GATHERED UP
448-135065-0022 AND SHE HAS NEVER SPOKEN TO ME SINCE AND I SOMETIMES THINK SHE CAN'T SPEAK FOR PAIN
448-135065-0023 AND YOU CAN GET THE KEY IF YOU CHOOSE I SAID YES WHEN I AM UP STAIRS HE ANSWERED BUT I CAN'T WALK UP STAIRS NOW IN WHAT APARTMENT IS IT I ASKED OH HE CRIED I SHAN'T TELL YOU WHERE IT IS IT IS OUR SECRET
448-135065-0024 I CONSIDERED IT BEST TO DEPART WITHOUT SEEING MISTER HEATHCLIFF AND BRING A RESCUE FOR MY YOUNG LADY FROM THE GRANGE
448-135065-0025 BUT I BESPOKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF IT MYSELF HOW CHANGED I FOUND HIM EVEN IN THOSE FEW DAYS HE LAY AN IMAGE OF SADNESS AND RESIGNATION AWAITING HIS DEATH VERY YOUNG HE LOOKED
448-135065-0026 THOUGH HIS ACTUAL AGE WAS THIRTY NINE ONE WOULD HAVE CALLED HIM TEN YEARS YOUNGER AT LEAST HE THOUGHT OF CATHERINE FOR HE MURMURED HER NAME I TOUCHED HIS HAND AND SPOKE CATHERINE IS COMING DEAR MASTER I WHISPERED SHE IS ALIVE AND WELL AND WILL BE HERE I HOPE TO NIGHT
448-135065-0027 I TREMBLED AT THE FIRST EFFECTS OF THIS INTELLIGENCE HE HALF ROSE UP LOOKED EAGERLY ROUND THE APARTMENT AND THEN SANK BACK IN A SWOON AS SOON AS HE RECOVERED I RELATED OUR COMPULSORY VISIT AND DETENTION AT THE HEIGHTS
448-135065-0028 I SAID HEATHCLIFF FORCED ME TO GO IN WHICH WAS NOT QUITE TRUE I UTTERED AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE AGAINST LINTON NOR DID I DESCRIBE ALL HIS FATHER'S BRUTAL CONDUCT MY INTENTIONS BEING TO ADD NO BITTERNESS IF I COULD HELP IT TO HIS ALREADY OVER FLOWING CUP
448-135065-0029 AS WELL AS THE ESTATE TO HIS SON OR RATHER HIMSELF YET WHY HE DID NOT WAIT TILL HIS DECEASE WAS A PUZZLE TO MY MASTER BECAUSE IGNORANT HOW NEARLY HE AND HIS NEPHEW WOULD QUIT THE WORLD TOGETHER HOWEVER HE FELT THAT HIS WILL HAD BETTER BE ALTERED
448-135065-0030 INSTEAD OF LEAVING CATHERINE'S FORTUNE AT HER OWN DISPOSAL HE DETERMINED TO PUT IT IN THE HANDS OF TRUSTEES FOR HER USE DURING LIFE AND FOR HER CHILDREN IF SHE HAD ANY AFTER HER BY THAT MEANS IT COULD NOT FALL TO MISTER HEATHCLIFF SHOULD LINTON DIE
448-135065-0031 HAVING RECEIVED HIS ORDERS I DESPATCHED A MAN TO FETCH THE ATTORNEY AND FOUR MORE PROVIDED WITH SERVICEABLE WEAPONS TO DEMAND MY YOUNG LADY OF HER JAILOR BOTH PARTIES WERE DELAYED VERY LATE THE SINGLE SERVANT RETURNED FIRST HE SAID MISTER GREEN THE LAWYER
448-135065-0032 WAS OUT WHEN HE ARRIVED AT HIS HOUSE AND HE HAD TO WAIT TWO HOURS FOR HIS RE ENTRANCE AND THEN MISTER GREEN TOLD HIM HE HAD A LITTLE BUSINESS IN THE VILLAGE THAT MUST BE DONE BUT HE WOULD BE AT THRUSHCROSS GRANGE BEFORE MORNING THE FOUR MEN CAME BACK UNACCOMPANIED ALSO
448-135065-0033 THEY BROUGHT WORD THAT CATHERINE WAS ILL TOO ILL TO QUIT HER ROOM AND HEATHCLIFF WOULD NOT SUFFER THEM TO SEE HER I SCOLDED THE STUPID FELLOWS WELL FOR LISTENING TO THAT TALE WHICH I WOULD NOT CARRY TO MY MASTER RESOLVING TO TAKE A WHOLE BEVY UP TO THE HEIGHTS AT DAY LIGHT
448-135065-0034 AND STORM IT LITERALLY UNLESS THE PRISONER WERE QUIETLY SURRENDERED TO US HER FATHER SHALL SEE HER I VOWED AND VOWED AGAIN IF THAT DEVIL BE KILLED ON HIS OWN DOORSTONES IN TRYING TO PREVENT IT HAPPILY I WAS SPARED THE JOURNEY AND THE TROUBLE
448-135065-0035 I HAD GONE DOWN STAIRS AT THREE O'CLOCK TO FETCH A JUG OF WATER AND WAS PASSING THROUGH THE HALL WITH IT IN MY HAND WHEN A SHARP KNOCK AT THE FRONT DOOR MADE ME JUMP OH IT IS GREEN I SAID RECOLLECTING MYSELF
448-135065-0036 AND I WENT ON INTENDING TO SEND SOMEBODY ELSE TO OPEN IT BUT THE KNOCK WAS REPEATED NOT LOUD AND STILL IMPORTUNATELY I PUT THE JUG ON THE BANISTER AND HASTENED TO ADMIT HIM MYSELF THE HARVEST MOON SHONE CLEAR OUTSIDE
448-135065-0037 IT WAS NOT THE ATTORNEY MY OWN SWEET LITTLE MISTRESS SPRANG ON MY NECK SOBBING ELLEN ELLEN IS PAPA ALIVE YES I CRIED YES MY ANGEL HE IS GOD BE THANKED YOU ARE SAFE WITH US AGAIN
448-135065-0038 SHE WANTED TO RUN BREATHLESS AS SHE WAS UP STAIRS TO MISTER LINTON'S ROOM BUT I COMPELLED HER TO SIT DOWN ON A CHAIR AND MADE HER DRINK AND WASHED HER PALE FACE CHAFING IT INTO A FAINT COLOUR WITH MY APRON THEN I SAID I MUST GO FIRST AND TELL OF HER ARRIVAL
448-135065-0039 IMPLORING HER TO SAY SHE SHOULD BE HAPPY WITH YOUNG HEATHCLIFF SHE STARED BUT SOON COMPREHENDING WHY I COUNSELLED HER TO UTTER THE FALSEHOOD SHE ASSURED ME SHE WOULD NOT COMPLAIN I COULDN'T ABIDE TO BE PRESENT AT THEIR MEETING
448-135065-0040 I STOOD OUTSIDE THE CHAMBER DOOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND HARDLY VENTURED NEAR THE BED THEN ALL WAS COMPOSED HOWEVER CATHERINE'S DESPAIR WAS AS SILENT AS HER FATHER'S JOY SHE SUPPORTED HIM CALMLY IN APPEARANCE
448-135065-0041 AND HE FIXED ON HER FEATURES HIS RAISED EYES THAT SEEMED DILATING WITH ECSTASY HE DIED BLISSFULLY MISTER LOCKWOOD HE DIED SO KISSING HER CHEEK HE MURMURED AM GOING TO HER AND YOU DARLING CHILD SHALL COME TO US AND NEVER STIRRED OR SPOKE AGAIN
448-135065-0042 NONE COULD HAVE NOTICED THE EXACT MINUTE OF HIS DEATH IT WAS SO ENTIRELY WITHOUT A STRUGGLE WHETHER CATHERINE HAD SPENT HER TEARS OR WHETHER THE GRIEF WERE TOO WEIGHTY TO LET THEM FLOW SHE SAT THERE DRY EYED TILL THE SUN ROSE
448-135065-0043 SHE SAT TILL NOON AND WOULD STILL HAVE REMAINED BROODING OVER THAT DEATHBED BUT I INSISTED ON HER COMING AWAY AND TAKING SOME REPOSE IT WAS WELL I SUCCEEDED IN REMOVING HER
448-135065-0044 HAVING CALLED AT WUTHERING HEIGHTS TO GET HIS INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO BEHAVE HE HAD SOLD HIMSELF TO MISTER HEATHCLIFF THAT WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS DELAY IN OBEYING MY MASTER'S SUMMONS
448-135065-0045 FORTUNATELY NO THOUGHT OF WORLDLY AFFAIRS CROSSED THE LATTER'S MIND TO DISTURB HIM AFTER HIS DAUGHTER'S ARRIVAL MISTER GREEN TOOK UPON HIMSELF TO ORDER EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY ABOUT THE PLACE HE GAVE ALL THE SERVANTS BUT ME NOTICE TO QUIT
448-135065-0046 HE WOULD HAVE CARRIED HIS DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO THE POINT OF INSISTING THAT EDGAR LINTON SHOULD NOT BE BURIED BESIDE HIS WIFE BUT IN THE CHAPEL WITH HIS FAMILY THERE WAS THE WILL HOWEVER TO HINDER THAT
448-135065-0047 AND MY LOUD PROTESTATIONS AGAINST ANY INFRINGEMENT OF ITS DIRECTIONS THE FUNERAL WAS HURRIED OVER CATHERINE MISSUS LINTON HEATHCLIFF NOW WAS SUFFERED TO STAY AT THE GRANGE TILL HER FATHER'S CORPSE HAD QUITTED IT
448-135065-0048 SHE TOLD ME THAT HER ANGUISH HAD AT LAST SPURRED LINTON TO INCUR THE RISK OF LIBERATING HER SHE HEARD THE MEN I SENT DISPUTING AT THE DOOR AND SHE GATHERED THE SENSE OF HEATHCLIFF'S ANSWER IT DROVE HER DESPERATE
448-135065-0049 LINTON WHO HAD BEEN CONVEYED UP TO THE LITTLE PARLOUR SOON AFTER I LEFT WAS TERRIFIED INTO FETCHING THE KEY BEFORE HIS FATHER RE ASCENDED HE HAD THE CUNNING TO UNLOCK AND RE LOCK THE DOOR WITHOUT SHUTTING IT
448-135065-0050 AND WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE GONE TO BED HE BEGGED TO SLEEP WITH HARETON AND HIS PETITION WAS GRANTED FOR ONCE CATHERINE STOLE OUT BEFORE BREAK OF DAY SHE DARED NOT TRY THE DOORS LEST THE DOGS SHOULD RAISE AN ALARM SHE VISITED THE EMPTY CHAMBERS AND EXAMINED THEIR WINDOWS
448-135065-0051 SHE GOT EASILY OUT OF ITS LATTICE AND ON TO THE GROUND BY MEANS OF THE FIR TREE CLOSE BY
