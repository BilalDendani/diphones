8356-240982-0000 THE VERY NEXT CASE WE FIND THAT JESUS WILL NOT ADMIT THE CAUSE OF THE MAN'S CONDITION BLINDNESS FROM HIS BIRTH
8356-240982-0001 OR OF HIS PARENTS THE PROBABILITY SEEMS TO JUDGE FROM THEIR BEHAVIOUR IN THE PERSECUTION THAT FOLLOWED THAT BOTH THE MAN AND HIS PARENTS WERE PEOPLE OF CHARACTER THOUGHT AND HONOURABLE PRUDENCE
8356-240982-0002 HE WAS BORN BLIND JESUS SAID THAT THE WORKS OF GOD SHOULD BE MADE MANIFEST IN HIM WHAT WORKS THEN THE WORK OF CREATION FOR ONE RATHER THAN THE WORK OF HEALING
8356-240982-0003 GOD HAD MADE HIM ONLY NOT SO BLESSED AS HIS FELLOWS WITH THE INTENT OF GIVING HIM EQUAL FACULTY AND EVEN GREATER ENJOYMENT AFTERWARDS
8356-240982-0004 IN HIM JESUS CREATED SIGHT BEFORE MEN'S EYES FOR AS AT THE FIRST GOD SAID LET THERE BE LIGHT SO THE WORK OF GOD IS STILL TO GIVE LIGHT TO THE WORLD
8356-240982-0005 AND BE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD LIGHT IN ALL ITS DEGREES AND KINDS
8356-240982-0006 AROUSING SLEEPY HEARTS AND OPENING BLIND EYES JESUS SAW THE MAN THE DISCIPLES ASKED THEIR QUESTION
8356-240982-0007 WHY THIS MEDIATING CLAY WHY THE SPITTLE AND THE TOUCH BECAUSE THE MAN WHO COULD NOT SEE HIM MUST YET BE BROUGHT INTO SENSIBLE CONTACT WITH HIM MUST KNOW THAT THE HEALING CAME FROM THE MAN WHO TOUCHED HIM
8356-240982-0008 OUR LORD TOOK PAINS ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE MAN WAS BLIND
8356-240982-0009 HAVING BLINDED HIM A SECOND TIME AS IT WERE WITH CLAY
8356-240982-0010 CLAY AND BLINDNESS SHOULD DEPART TOGETHER BY THE ACT OF THE MAN'S FAITH IT WAS AS IF THE LORD SAID I BLINDED THEE NOW GO AND SEE
8356-240982-0011 HERE THEN ARE THE LINKS OF THE CHAIN BY WHICH THE LORD BOUND THE MAN TO HIMSELF THE VOICE IF HEARD BY THE MAN WHICH DEFENDED HIM AND HIS PARENTS FROM THE JUDGMENT OF HIS DISCIPLES
8356-240982-0012 THE ASSERTION THAT HE WAS THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD A SOMETHING WHICH OTHERS HAD AND THE BLIND MAN ONLY KNEW AS NOT POSSESSED BY HIM THE SOUND OF THE SPITTING ON THE GROUND THE TOUCH OF THE SPEAKER'S FINGERS
8356-240982-0013 THE CLAY ON HIS EYES THE COMMAND TO WASH THE JOURNEY TO THE POOL THE LAVING WATER
8356-240982-0014 BUT WHO CAN IMAGINE SAVE IN A CONCEPTION ONLY LESS DIM THAN THE MAN'S BLINDNESS THE GLORY WHICH BURST UPON HIM WHEN AS THE RESTORING CLAY LEFT HIS EYES THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD INVADED HIS ASTONISHED SOUL
8356-240982-0015 THE VERY IDEA MAY WELL MAKE ONE TREMBLE BLACKNESS OF DARKNESS NOT AN INVADING STRANGER BUT THE HOME COMPANION ALWAYS THERE THE NEGATION NEVER UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE THE ASSERTION WAS UNKNOWN
8356-240982-0016 CREATION NOT ERASED AND TREASURED IN THE MEMORY BUT TO HIS EYES UNCREATED BLACKNESS OF DARKNESS THE GLORY OF THE CELESTIAL BLUE THE TOWERS OF THE GREAT JERUSALEM DWELLING IN THE AWFUL SPACE THE ROOM
8356-240982-0017 THE LIFE THE TENFOLD GLORIFIED BEING ANY WONDER MIGHT FOLLOW ON SUCH A WONDER AND THE WHOLE VISION WAS AS FRESH AS IF HE HAD THAT MOMENT BEEN CREATED THE FIRST OF MEN
8356-240982-0018 BUT THE BEST REMAINED BEHIND A MAN HAD SAID I AM THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD AND LO HERE WAS THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD
8356-240982-0019 THE WORDS HAD BEEN VAGUE AS A DARK FORM IN DARKNESS BUT NOW THE THING ITSELF HAD INVADED HIS INNERMOST SOUL BUT THE FACE OF THE MAN WHO WAS THIS LIGHT OF THE WORLD HE HAD NOT SEEN THE CREATOR OF HIS VISION
8356-240982-0020 BUT HE BELIEVED IN HIM FOR HE DEFENDED HIM FROM THE SAME CHARGE OF WICKEDNESS FROM WHICH JESUS HAD DEFENDED HIM GIVE GOD THE PRAISE THEY SAID WE KNOW THAT THIS MAN IS A SINNER
8356-240982-0021 GOD HEARETH NOT SINNERS HE REPLIED AND THIS MAN HATH OPENED MY EYES IT IS NO WONDER THAT WHEN JESUS FOUND HIM AND ASKED HIM DOST THOU BELIEVE ON THE SON OF GOD HE SHOULD REPLY WHO IS HE LORD
8356-240982-0022 THAT I MIGHT BELIEVE ON HIM HE WAS READY HE HAD ONLY TO KNOW WHICH WAS HE THAT HE MIGHT WORSHIP HIM HERE AT LENGTH WAS THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD BEFORE HIM THE MAN WHO HAD SAID
8356-240982-0023 I AM THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD AND STRAIGHTWAY THE WORLD BURST UPON HIM IN LIGHT WOULD THIS MAN EVER NEED FURTHER PROOF THAT THERE WAS INDEED A GOD OF MEN
8356-240982-0024 I SUSPECT HE HAD A GRANDER IDEA OF THE SON OF GOD THAN ANY OF HIS DISCIPLES AS YET THE WOULD BE REFUTATIONS OF EXPERIENCE FOR SINCE THE WORLD BEGAN
8356-240982-0025 THE OBJECTIONS OF THE RELIGIOUS AUTHORITIES THIS MAN IS NOT OF GOD BECAUSE HE KEEPETH NOT THE SABBATH DAY ENDLESS POSSIBLE PERPLEXITIES OF THE UNDERSTANDING AND QUESTIONS OF THE HOW AND THE WHY
8356-240982-0026 ONE THING I KNOW THAT WHEREAS I WAS BLIND NOW I SEE THE MAN COULD NOT CONVINCE THE JEWS THAT JESUS MUST BE A GOOD MAN NEITHER COULD HE DOUBT IT HIMSELF
8356-240982-0027 WHOSE VERY BEING BODY AND SOUL AND SPIRIT HAD BEEN ENLIGHTENED AND GLORIFIED BY HIM
8356-240982-0028 IN THE BRAIN IN THE HEART LIGHT PERMEATING AND UNIFYING HIS PHYSICAL AND MORAL NATURE ASSERTING ITSELF IN SHOWING THE MAN TO HIMSELF ONE WHOLE HOW COULD HE DOUBT
8356-240982-0029 THE MIRACLES WERE FOR THE PERSONS ON WHOM THEY PASSED TO THE SPECTATORS THEY WERE SOMETHING IT IS TRUE BUT THEY WERE OF UNSPEAKABLE VALUE TO AND OF ENDLESS INFLUENCE UPON THEIR SUBJECTS
8356-240982-0030 WAS THROUGH THE HEALED THEMSELVES AND THE TESTIMONY OF THEIR LIVES WOULD GO FAR BEYOND THE TESTIMONY OF THEIR TONGUES THEIR TONGUES COULD BUT WITNESS TO A FACT THEIR LIVES COULD WITNESS TO A TRUTH
8356-240982-0031 IN THIS MIRACLE AS IN ALL THE REST JESUS DID IN LITTLE THE GREAT WORK OF THE FATHER FOR HOW MANY MORE ARE THEY TO WHOM GOD HAS GIVEN THE MARVEL OF VISION
8356-240982-0032 THAN THOSE BLIND WHOM THE LORD ENLIGHTENED
8356-240982-0033 HE WHO USES HIS VISION ONLY FOR THE CARE OF HIS BODY OR THE INDULGENCE OF HIS MIND HOW SHOULD HE UNDERSTAND THE GIFT OF GOD IN ITS MARVEL
8356-240982-0034 WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT A DIVINE INVENTION WHAT A MIGHTY GIFT OF GOD IS THIS VERY COMMON THING THESE EYES TO SEE WITH THAT LIGHT WHICH ENLIGHTENS THE WORLD THIS SIGHT WHICH IS THE RESULT OF BOTH HE WILL UNDERSTAND
8356-240982-0035 YEA HOW THE MIGHTY INBURST OF SPLENDOUR MIGHT RENDER HIM SO CAPABLE OF BELIEVING THAT NOTHING SHOULD BE TOO GRAND AND GOOD FOR HIM TO BELIEVE THEREAFTER NOT EVEN THE DOCTRINE HARDEST TO COMMONPLACE HUMANITY
8356-240982-0036 THOUGH THE MOST NATURAL AND REASONABLE TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEHELD IT THAT THE GOD OF THE LIGHT IS A FAITHFUL LOVING UPRIGHT HONEST AND SELF DENYING BEING YEA UTTERLY DEVOTED TO THE UTTERMOST GOOD OF THOSE WHOM HE HAS MADE
8356-240982-0037 SUCH IS THE FATHER OF LIGHTS WHO ENLIGHTENS THE WORLD AND EVERY MAN THAT COMETH INTO IT EVERY PULSATION OF LIGHT ON EVERY BRAIN IS FROM HIM EVERY FEELING OF LAW AND ORDER IS FROM HIM
8356-240982-0038 EVERY HINT OF RIGHT EVERY DESIRE AFTER THE TRUE WHATEVER WE CALL ASPIRATION ALL LONGING FOR THE LIGHT EVERY PERCEPTION THAT THIS IS TRUE THAT THAT OUGHT TO BE DONE IS FROM THE FATHER OF LIGHTS
8356-240982-0039 HIS INFINITE AND VARIED LIGHT GATHERED INTO ONE POINT FOR HOW SHALL WE SPEAK AT ALL OF THESE THINGS IF WE DO NOT SPEAK IN FIGURES CONCENTRATED AND EMBODIED IN JESUS BECAME THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD
8356-240982-0040 FOR THE LIGHT IS NO LONGER ONLY DIFFUSED BUT IN HIM MAN BEHOLDS THE LIGHT AND WHENCE IT FLOWS NOT MERELY IS OUR CHAMBER ENLIGHTENED BUT WE SEE THE LAMP AND SO WE TURN AGAIN TO GOD
8356-240982-0041 THE FATHER OF LIGHTS YEA EVEN OF THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD HENCEFORTH WE KNOW THAT ALL THE LIGHT WHEREVER DIFFUSED HAS ITS CENTRE IN GOD AS THE LIGHT THAT ENLIGHTENED THE BLIND MAN FLOWED FROM ITS CENTRE IN JESUS
8356-240982-0042 IN OTHER WORDS WE HAVE A GLIMMERING FAINT HUMAN PERCEPTION OF THE ABSOLUTE GLORY WE KNOW WHAT GOD IS IN RECOGNIZING HIM AS OUR GOD JESUS
8356-240982-0043 DID THE WORKS OF THE FATHER THE NEXT MIRACLE RECORDED BY SAINT LUKE ALONE IS THE CURE OF THE MAN WITH THE DROPSY WROUGHT ALSO UPON THE SABBATH
8356-240982-0044 BUT IN THE HOUSE OF ONE OF THE CHIEF OF THE PHARISEES THITHER OUR LORD HAD GONE TO AN ENTERTAINMENT APPARENTLY LARGE FOR THE FOLLOWING PARABLE IS SPOKEN TO THOSE WHICH WERE BIDDEN
8356-240982-0045 WHEN HE MARKED HOW THEY CHOSE OUT THE CHIEF ROOMS FOOTNOTE ONE NOT ROOMS BUT RECLINING PLACES AT THE TABLE HENCE THE POSSIBILITY AT LEAST IS SUGGESTED THAT THE MAN WAS ONE OF THE GUESTS
8356-240982-0046 NO DOUBT THEIR HOUSES WERE MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN OURS AND IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR ONE UNINVITED TO MAKE HIS WAY IN ESPECIALLY UPON OCCASION OF SUCH A GATHERING BUT I THINK THE WORD TRANSLATED BEFORE HIM MEANS OPPOSITE TO HIM
8356-240982-0047 AT THE TABLE AND THAT THE MAN WAS NOT TOO ILL TO APPEAR AS A GUEST THE TOOK HIM AND HEALED HIM AND LET HIM GO OF OUR TRANSLATION IS AGAINST THE NOTION RATHER BUT MERELY
8356-240982-0048 FROM ITS INDEFINITENESS BEING CAPABLE OF MEANING THAT HE SENT HIM AWAY BUT SUCH IS NOT THE MEANING OF THE ORIGINAL THAT MERELY IMPLIES THAT HE TOOK HIM WENT TO HIM AND LAID HIS HANDS UPON HIM THUS CONNECTING THE CURE WITH HIMSELF
8356-240982-0049 AND THEN RELEASED HIM SET HIM FREE TOOK HIS HANDS OFF HIM TURNING AT ONCE TO THE OTHER GUESTS AND JUSTIFYING HIMSELF BY APPEALING TO THEIR OWN RIGHTEOUS CONDUCT TOWARDS THE ASS AND THE OX
8356-240982-0050 I THINK THE MAN REMAINED RECLINING AT THE TABLE TO ENJOY THE APPETITE OF HEALTH AT A GOOD MEAL IF INDEED THE GLADNESS OF THE RELIEVED BREATH THE SENSE OF LIGHTNESS AND STRENGTH
8356-240982-0051 DID NOT MAKE HIM TOO HAPPY TO CARE ABOUT HIS DINNER I COME NOW TO THE LAST OF THE GROUP EXCEPTIONAL IN ITS NATURE
8356-240982-0052 BUT THE REPARATION OF AN INJURY OR HURT AT LEAST INFLICTED BY ONE OF HIS OWN FOLLOWERS
8356-240982-0053 THE OTHER EVANGELISTS RELATE THE OCCASION OF THE MIRACLE BUT NOT THE MIRACLE ITSELF THEY RECORD THE BLOW BUT NOT THE TOUCH I SHALL NOT THEREFORE COMPARE THEIR ACCOUNTS WHICH HAVE CONSIDERABLE VARIETY BUT NO INCONSISTENCY
8356-240982-0054 PETER INTENDING DOUBTLESS TO CLEAVE THE HEAD OF A SERVANT OF THE HIGH PRIEST WHO HAD COME OUT TO TAKE JESUS WITH UNACCUSTOMED HAND PROBABLY TREMBLING WITH RAGE AND PERHAPS WITH FEAR
8356-240982-0055 MISSED HIS WELL MEANT AIM AND ONLY CUT OFF THE MAN'S EAR JESUS SAID SUFFER YE THUS FAR
8356-240982-0056 IS THIS THE LIMIT OF YOUR PATIENCE BUT I DO NOT KNOW WITH THE WORDS HE TOUCHED HIS EAR AND HEALED HIM HARDLY HAD THE WOUND REACHED THE TRUE STING OF ITS PAIN
8356-240982-0057 BEFORE THE GENTLE HAND OF HIM WHOM THE SERVANT HAD COME TO DRAG TO THE TORTURE DISMISSED THE AGONY AS IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN WHETHER HE RESTORED THE EAR
8356-240982-0058 OR LEFT THE LOSS OF IT FOR A REMINDER TO THE MAN OF THE PART HE HAD TAKEN AGAINST HIS LORD AND THE RETURN THE LORD HAD MADE HIM WE DO NOT KNOW NEITHER DO WE KNOW WHETHER HE TURNED BACK ASHAMED AND CONTRITE NOW THAT IN HIS OWN PERSON
8356-240982-0059 HE HAD FELT THE LIFE THAT DWELT IN JESUS OR FOLLOWED OUT THE CAPTURE TO THE END POSSIBLY THE BLOW OF PETER WAS THE FORM WHICH THE FAVOUR OF GOD TOOK
8356-240982-0060 BUT THE LORD WOULD COUNTENANCE NO VIOLENCE DONE IN HIS DEFENCE THEY MIGHT DO TO HIM AS THEY WOULD IF HIS FATHER WOULD NOT DEFEND HIM NEITHER WOULD HE DEFEND HIMSELF
8356-240982-0061 WITHIN SIGHT OF THE FEARFUL DEATH THAT AWAITED HIM HIS HEART WAS NO WHIT HARDENED TO THE PAIN OF ANOTHER NEITHER DID IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE THAT IT WAS THE PAIN OF AN ENEMY
8356-240982-0062 EVEN AN ENEMY WHO WAS TAKING HIM TO THE CROSS THERE WAS SUFFERING HERE WAS HEALING HE CAME TO DO THE WORKS OF HIM THAT SENT HIM
