956-127929-0000 SPARGO WENT ROUND AGAIN TO THE TEMPLE THAT NIGHT AT NINE O'CLOCK ASKING HIMSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST HOW MUCH DOES ELPHICK KNOW THE SECOND HOW MUCH SHALL I TELL HIM
956-127929-0001 THE OLD HOUSE IN THE TEMPLE TO WHICH HE REPAIRED AND IN WHICH MANY A GENERATION OF OLD FOGIES HAD LIVED SINCE THE DAYS OF QUEEN ANNE WAS FULL OF STAIRS AND PASSAGES AND AS SPARGO HAD FORGOTTEN TO GET THE EXACT NUMBER
956-127929-0002 OF THE SET OF CHAMBERS HE WANTED HE WAS OBLIGED TO WANDER ABOUT IN WHAT WAS A DESERTED BUILDING SO WANDERING HE SUDDENLY HEARD STEPS FIRM DECISIVE STEPS COMING UP A STAIRCASE WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD JUST CLIMBED
956-127929-0003 HE LOOKED OVER THE BANISTERS DOWN INTO THE HOLLOW BENEATH AND THERE MARCHING UP RESOLUTELY
956-127929-0004 AND SPARGO SUDDENLY REALIZED WITH A SHARP QUICKENING OF HIS PULSES
956-127929-0005 SPARGO'S MIND ACTED QUICKLY KNOWING WHAT HE NOW KNEW FROM HIS EXTRAORDINARY DEALINGS WITH MOTHER GUTCH HE HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT MISS BAYLIS HAD COME TO SEE MISTER ELPHICK COME OF COURSE TO TELL MISTER ELPHICK THAT HE SPARGO HAD VISITED HER THAT MORNING
956-127929-0006 AND THAT HE WAS ON THE TRACK OF THE MAITLAND SECRET HISTORY HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE FOR HE HAD BEEN BUSILY ENGAGED SINCE THE DEPARTURE OF MOTHER GUTCH BUT NATURALLY MISS BAYLIS AND MISTER ELPHICK WOULD KEEP IN COMMUNICATION WITH EACH OTHER
956-127929-0007 AT ANY RATE HERE SHE WAS AND HER DESTINATION WAS SURELY ELPHICK'S CHAMBERS AND THE QUESTION FOR HIM SPARGO WAS WHAT TO DO WHAT SPARGO DID WAS TO REMAIN IN ABSOLUTE SILENCE MOTIONLESS TENSE
956-127929-0008 WHERE HE WAS ON THE STAIR AND TO TRUST TO THE CHANCE THAT THE WOMAN DID NOT LOOK UP BUT MISS BAYLIS NEITHER LOOKED UP NOR DOWN SHE REACHED A LANDING TURNED ALONG A CORRIDOR WITH DECISION AND MARCHED FORWARD
956-127929-0009 SHARP DOUBLE KNOCK ON A DOOR A MOMENT AFTER THAT HE HEARD A DOOR HEAVILY SHUT HE KNEW THEN THAT MISS BAYLIS HAD SOUGHT AND GAINED ADMITTANCE SOMEWHERE
956-127929-0010 TO FIND OUT PRECISELY WHERE THAT SOMEWHERE WAS DREW SPARGO DOWN TO THE LANDING WHICH MISS BAYLIS HAD JUST LEFT THERE WAS NO ONE ABOUT HE HAD NOT IN FACT SEEN A SOUL SINCE HE ENTERED THE BUILDING
956-127929-0011 ACCORDINGLY HE WENT ALONG THE CORRIDOR INTO WHICH HE HAD SEEN MISS BAYLIS TURN HE KNEW THAT ALL THE DOORS IN THAT HOUSE WERE DOUBLE ONES AND THAT THE OUTER OAK IN EACH WAS SOLID AND SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH TO BE SOUND PROOF YET
956-127929-0012 AS MEN WILL UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES HE WALKED SOFTLY HE SAID TO HIMSELF SMILING AT THE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD BE SURE TO START IF SOMEBODY SUDDENLY OPENED A DOOR ON HIM
956-127929-0013 ON WHICH WAS PAINTED IN WHITE LETTERS ON A BLACK GROUND MISTER ELPHICK'S CHAMBERS HAVING SATISFIED HIMSELF AS TO HIS EXACT WHEREABOUTS SPARGO DREW BACK AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
956-127929-0014 THERE WAS A WINDOW HALF WAY ALONG THE CORRIDOR FROM WHICH HE HAD NOTICED AS HE CAME ALONG ONE COULD CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE EMBANKMENT AND THE THAMES TO THIS HE WITHDREW AND LEANING ON THE SILL LOOKED OUT AND CONSIDERED MATTERS SHOULD HE GO
956-127929-0015 AND IF HE COULD GAIN ADMITTANCE BEARD THESE TWO CONSPIRATORS SHOULD HE WAIT UNTIL THE WOMAN CAME OUT AND LET HER SEE THAT HE WAS ON THE TRACK SHOULD HE HIDE AGAIN UNTIL SHE WENT AND THEN SEE ELPHICK ALONE
956-127929-0016 IN THE END SPARGO DID NONE OF THESE THINGS IMMEDIATELY HE LET THINGS SLIDE FOR THE MOMENT
956-127929-0017 AND THE BUILDINGS ACROSS ON THE SURREY SIDE TEN MINUTES WENT BY TWENTY MINUTES NOTHING HAPPENED THEN AS HALF PAST NINE STRUCK FROM ALL THE NEIGHBOURING CLOCKS SPARGO FLUNG AWAY A SECOND CIGARETTE
956-127929-0018 MARCHED STRAIGHT DOWN THE CORRIDOR AND KNOCKED BOLDLY AT MISTER ELPHICK'S DOOR GREATLY TO SPARGO'S SURPRISE THE DOOR WAS OPENED BEFORE THERE WAS ANY NECESSITY TO KNOCK AGAIN AND THERE CALMLY CONFRONTING HIM
956-127929-0019 A BENEVOLENT YET SOMEWHAT DEPRECATING EXPRESSION ON HIS SPECTACLED AND PLACID FACE STOOD MISTER ELPHICK A SMOKING CAP ON HIS HEAD
956-127929-0020 AND A SHORT PIPE IN HIS HAND SPARGO WAS TAKEN ABACK MISTER ELPHICK APPARENTLY WAS NOT HE HELD THE DOOR WELL OPEN AND MOTIONED THE JOURNALIST TO ENTER COME IN MISTER SPARGO HE SAID I WAS EXPECTING YOU
956-127929-0021 WALK FORWARD INTO MY SITTING ROOM SPARGO MUCH ASTONISHED AT THIS RECEPTION PASSED THROUGH AN ANTE ROOM INTO A HANDSOMELY FURNISHED APARTMENT FULL OF BOOKS AND PICTURES
956-127929-0022 IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT IT WAS STILL VERY LITTLE PAST MIDSUMMER THERE WAS A CHEERY FIRE IN THE GRATE AND ON A TABLE SET NEAR A ROOMY ARM CHAIR WAS SET SUCH CREATURE COMFORTS AS A SPIRIT CASE A SYPHON A TUMBLER AND A NOVEL
956-127929-0023 BUT IN ANOTHER ARMCHAIR ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HEARTH WAS THE FORBIDDING FIGURE OF MISS BAYLIS BLACKER GLOOMIER MORE MYSTERIOUS THAN EVER SHE NEITHER SPOKE NOR MOVED WHEN SPARGO ENTERED SHE DID NOT EVEN LOOK AT HIM
956-127929-0024 AND SPARGO STOOD STARING AT HER UNTIL MISTER ELPHICK HAVING CLOSED HIS DOORS TOUCHED HIM ON THE ELBOW AND MOTIONED HIM COURTEOUSLY TO A SEAT YES I WAS EXPECTING YOU MISTER SPARGO HE SAID AS HE RESUMED HIS OWN CHAIR
