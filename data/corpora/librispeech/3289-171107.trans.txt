3289-171107-0000 CHAPTER ONE HOW THE CITY JERUSALEM WAS TAKEN AND THE TEMPLE PILLAGED BY ANTIOCHUS EPIPHANES AS ALSO CONCERNING THE ACTIONS OF THE MACCABEES MATTHIAS AND JUDAS
3289-171107-0001 HAD A QUARREL WITH THE SIXTH PTOLEMY ABOUT HIS RIGHT TO THE WHOLE COUNTRY OF SYRIA A GREAT SEDITION FELL AMONG THE MEN OF POWER IN JUDEA AND THEY HAD A CONTENTION ABOUT OBTAINING THE GOVERNMENT WHILE EACH OF THOSE THAT WERE OF DIGNITY COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE SUBJECT TO THEIR EQUALS
3289-171107-0002 COMPLIED WITH THEM AND CAME UPON THE JEWS WITH A GREAT ARMY AND TOOK THEIR CITY BY FORCE AND SLEW A GREAT MULTITUDE OF THOSE THAT FAVORED PTOLEMY AND SENT OUT HIS SOLDIERS TO PLUNDER THEM WITHOUT MERCY
3289-171107-0003 HE ALSO SPOILED THE TEMPLE AND PUT A STOP TO THE CONSTANT PRACTICE OF OFFERING A DAILY SACRIFICE OF EXPIATION FOR THREE YEARS AND SIX MONTHS
3289-171107-0004 OR WITH ITS PILLAGE OR WITH THE GREAT SLAUGHTER HE HAD MADE THERE BUT BEING OVERCOME WITH HIS VIOLENT PASSIONS AND REMEMBERING WHAT HE HAD SUFFERED DURING THE SIEGE HE COMPELLED THE JEWS TO DISSOLVE THE LAWS OF THEIR COUNTRY AND TO KEEP THEIR INFANTS UNCIRCUMCISED
3289-171107-0005 AND TO SACRIFICE SWINE'S FLESH UPON THE ALTAR
3289-171107-0006 TILL AT LENGTH HE PROVOKED THE POOR SUFFERERS BY THE EXTREMITY OF HIS WICKED DOINGS TO AVENGE THEMSELVES THREE ACCORDINGLY MATTHIAS THE SON OF ASAMONEUS ONE OF THE PRIESTS WHO LIVED IN A VILLAGE CALLED MODIN ARMED HIMSELF
3289-171107-0007 AND THEREUPON OUT OF THE FEAR OF THE MANY GARRISONS OF THE ENEMY HE FLED TO THE MOUNTAINS AND SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE FOLLOWED HIM THAT HE WAS ENCOURAGED TO COME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS AND TO GIVE BATTLE TO ANTIOCHUS'S GENERALS
3289-171107-0008 WHEN HE BEAT THEM AND DROVE THEM OUT OF JUDEA SO HE CAME TO THE GOVERNMENT BY THIS HIS SUCCESS AND BECAME THE PRINCE OF HIS OWN PEOPLE BY THEIR OWN FREE CONSENT AND THEN DIED LEAVING THE GOVERNMENT TO JUDAS HIS ELDEST SON FOUR
3289-171107-0009 NOW JUDAS SUPPOSING THAT ANTIOCHUS WOULD NOT LIE STILL GATHERED AN ARMY OUT OF HIS OWN COUNTRYMEN AND WAS THE FIRST THAT MADE A LEAGUE OF FRIENDSHIP WITH THE ROMANS AND DROVE EPIPHANES OUT OF THE COUNTRY WHEN HE HAD MADE A SECOND EXPEDITION INTO IT
3289-171107-0010 AND THIS BY GIVING HIM A GREAT DEFEAT THERE AND WHEN HE WAS WARMED BY THIS GREAT SUCCESS HE MADE AN ASSAULT UPON THE GARRISON THAT WAS IN THE CITY FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN CUT OFF HITHERTO SO HE EJECTED THEM OUT OF THE UPPER CITY
3289-171107-0011 FIVE SO THIS ANTIOCHUS GOT TOGETHER FIFTY THOUSAND FOOTMEN AND FIVE THOUSAND HORSEMEN AND FOURSCORE ELEPHANTS AND MARCHED THROUGH JUDEA INTO THE MOUNTAINOUS PARTS HE THEN TOOK BETHSURA WHICH WAS A SMALL CITY
3289-171107-0012 AND WITH MILITARY TRAPPINGS OF GOLD TO GUARD HIM AND SUPPOSING THAT ANTIOCHUS HIMSELF WAS UPON HIM HE RAN A GREAT WAY BEFORE HIS OWN ARMY AND CUTTING HIS WAY THROUGH THE ENEMY'S TROOPS HE GOT UP TO THE ELEPHANT
3289-171107-0013 NOW HE THAT GOVERNED THE ELEPHANT WAS BUT A PRIVATE MAN AND HAD HE PROVED TO BE ANTIOCHUS
3289-171107-0014 NAY THIS DISAPPOINTMENT PROVED AN OMEN TO HIS BROTHER JUDAS HOW THE ENTIRE BATTLE WOULD END IT IS TRUE THAT THE JEWS FOUGHT IT OUT BRAVELY FOR A LONG TIME BUT THE KING'S FORCES BEING SUPERIOR IN NUMBER AND HAVING FORTUNE ON THEIR SIDE OBTAINED THE VICTORY
3289-171107-0015 AND WHEN A GREAT MANY OF HIS MEN WERE SLAIN JUDAS TOOK THE REST WITH HIM AND FLED TO THE TOPARCHY OF GOPHNA SO ANTIOCHUS WENT TO JERUSALEM AND STAID THERE BUT A FEW DAYS FOR HE WANTED PROVISIONS AND SO HE WENT HIS WAY
3289-171107-0016 HE LEFT INDEED A GARRISON BEHIND HIM SUCH AS HE THOUGHT SUFFICIENT TO KEEP THE PLACE BUT DREW THE REST OF HIS ARMY OFF TO TAKE THEIR WINTER QUARTERS IN SYRIA SIX NOW AFTER THE KING WAS DEPARTED JUDAS WAS NOT IDLE
3289-171107-0017 FOR AS MANY OF HIS OWN NATION CAME TO HIM SO DID HE GATHER THOSE THAT HAD ESCAPED OUT OF THE BATTLE TOGETHER AND GAVE BATTLE AGAIN TO ANTIOCHUS'S GENERALS AT A VILLAGE CALLED ADASA AND BEING TOO HARD FOR HIS ENEMIES IN THE BATTLE AND KILLING A GREAT NUMBER OF THEM
3289-171107-0018 HE WAS AT LAST HIMSELF SLAIN ALSO NOR WAS IT MANY DAYS AFTERWARD THAT HIS BROTHER JOHN HAD A PLOT LAID AGAINST HIM BY ANTIOCHUS'S PARTY AND WAS SLAIN BY THEM CHAPTER TWO CONCERNING THE SUCCESSORS OF JUDAS
3289-171107-0019 WHO WERE JONATHAN AND SIMON AND JOHN HYRCANUS ONE WHEN JONATHAN WHO WAS JUDAS'S BROTHER SUCCEEDED HIM HE BEHAVED HIMSELF WITH GREAT CIRCUMSPECTION IN OTHER RESPECTS WITH RELATION TO HIS OWN PEOPLE
3289-171107-0020 AND HE CORROBORATED HIS AUTHORITY BY PRESERVING HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH THE ROMANS HE ALSO MADE A LEAGUE WITH ANTIOCHUS THE SON YET WAS NOT ALL THIS SUFFICIENT FOR HIS SECURITY FOR THE TYRANT TRYPHO WHO WAS GUARDIAN TO ANTIOCHUS'S SON LAID A PLOT AGAINST HIM
3289-171107-0021 YET COULD NOT HE MAKE THE KING ASHAMED OF HIS AMBITION THOUGH HE HAD ASSISTED HIM IN KILLING TRYPHO
3289-171107-0022 HE ALSO LAID A GREAT MANY MEN IN AMBUSH IN MANY PLACES OF THE MOUNTAINS AND WAS SUPERIOR IN ALL HIS ATTACKS UPON THEM AND WHEN HE HAD BEEN CONQUEROR AFTER SO GLORIOUS A MANNER HE WAS MADE HIGH PRIEST AND ALSO FREED THE JEWS FROM THE DOMINION OF THE MACEDONIANS
3289-171107-0023 AFTER ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY YEARS OF THE EMPIRE OF SELEUCUS THREE THIS SIMON ALSO HAD A PLOT LAID AGAINST HIM AND WAS SLAIN AT A FEAST BY HIS SON IN LAW PTOLEMY WHO PUT HIS WIFE AND TWO SONS INTO PRISON AND SENT SOME PERSONS TO KILL JOHN WHO WAS ALSO CALLED HYRCANUS
3289-171107-0024 BUT WAS REPELLED BY THE PEOPLE WHO HAD JUST THEN ADMITTED OF HYRCANUS SO HE RETIRED PRESENTLY TO ONE OF THE FORTRESSES THAT WERE ABOUT JERICHO WHICH WAS CALLED DAGON NOW WHEN HYRCANUS HAD RECEIVED THE HIGH PRIESTHOOD WHICH HIS FATHER HAD HELD BEFORE
3289-171107-0025 HE MADE GREAT HASTE TO ATTACK PTOLEMY THAT HE MIGHT AFFORD RELIEF TO HIS MOTHER AND BRETHREN FOUR SO HE LAID SIEGE TO THE FORTRESS AND WAS SUPERIOR TO PTOLEMY IN OTHER RESPECTS BUT WAS OVERCOME BY HIM AS TO THE JUST AFFECTION HE HAD FOR HIS RELATIONS
3289-171107-0026 FOR WHEN PTOLEMY WAS DISTRESSED HE BROUGHT FORTH HIS MOTHER AND HIS BRETHREN AND SET THEM UPON THE WALL AND BEAT THEM WITH RODS IN EVERY BODY'S SIGHT AND THREATENED THAT UNLESS HE WOULD GO AWAY IMMEDIATELY HE WOULD THROW THEM DOWN HEADLONG
3289-171107-0027 AT WHICH SIGHT HYRCANUS'S COMMISERATION AND CONCERN WERE TOO HARD FOR HIS ANGER BUT HIS MOTHER WAS NOT DISMAYED NEITHER AT THE STRIPES SHE RECEIVED NOR AT THE DEATH WITH WHICH SHE WAS THREATENED
3289-171107-0028 THE YEAR OF REST CAME ON UPON WHICH THE JEWS REST EVERY SEVENTH YEAR AS THEY DO ON EVERY SEVENTH DAY ON THIS YEAR THEREFORE PTOLEMY WAS FREED FROM BEING BESIEGED AND SLEW THE BRETHREN OF JOHN WITH THEIR MOTHER AND FLED TO ZENO
3289-171107-0029 WHO WAS TYRANT OF PHILADELPHIA FIVE AND NOW ANTIOCHUS WAS SO ANGRY AT WHAT HE HAD SUFFERED FROM SIMON THAT HE MADE AN EXPEDITION INTO JUDEA AND SAT DOWN BEFORE JERUSALEM AND BESIEGED HYRCANUS
3289-171107-0030 SIX HOWEVER AT ANOTHER TIME WHEN ANTIOCHUS WAS GONE UPON AN EXPEDITION AGAINST THE MEDES AND SO GAVE HYRCANUS AN OPPORTUNITY OF BEING REVENGED UPON HIM HE IMMEDIATELY MADE AN ATTACK UPON THE CITIES OF SYRIA AS THINKING WHAT PROVED TO BE THE CASE WITH THEM
3289-171107-0031 SO HE TOOK MEDABA AND SAMEA WITH THE TOWNS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AS ALSO SHECHEM AND GERIZZIM AND BESIDES THESE HE SUBDUED THE NATION OF THE CUTHEANS WHO DWELT ROUND ABOUT THAT TEMPLE WHICH WAS BUILT IN IMITATION OF THE TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM
3289-171107-0032 HE ALSO TOOK A GREAT MANY OTHER CITIES OF IDUMEA WITH ADOREON AND MARISSA SEVEN
3289-171107-0033 AND SHUT THE MULTITUDE AGAIN WITHIN THE WALL AND WHEN THEY HAD TAKEN THE CITY THEY DEMOLISHED IT AND MADE SLAVES OF ITS INHABITANTS AND AS THEY HAD STILL GREAT SUCCESS IN THEIR UNDERTAKINGS THEY DID NOT SUFFER THEIR ZEAL TO COOL
3289-171107-0034 BUT MARCHED WITH AN ARMY AS FAR AS SCYTHOPOLIS AND MADE AN INCURSION UPON IT AND LAID WASTE ALL THE COUNTRY THAT LAY WITHIN MOUNT CARMEL EIGHT BUT THEN THESE SUCCESSES OF JOHN AND OF HIS SONS MADE THEM BE ENVIED
3289-171107-0035 AND ADMINISTERED THE GOVERNMENT AFTER A MOST EXTRAORDINARY MANNER AND THIS FOR THIRTY THREE ENTIRE YEARS TOGETHER HE DIED LEAVING FIVE SONS BEHIND HIM HE WAS CERTAINLY A VERY HAPPY MAN
