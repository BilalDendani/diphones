2498-134785-0000 WHAT HE DOES JEAN VALJEAN LISTENED NOT A SOUND HE GAVE THE DOOR A PUSH HE PUSHED IT GENTLY WITH THE TIP OF HIS FINGER
2498-134785-0001 LIGHTLY WITH THE FURTIVE AND UNEASY GENTLENESS OF A CAT WHICH IS DESIROUS OF ENTERING THE DOOR YIELDED TO THIS PRESSURE AND MADE AN IMPERCEPTIBLE AND SILENT MOVEMENT WHICH ENLARGED THE OPENING A LITTLE
2498-134785-0002 HE WAITED A MOMENT THEN GAVE THE DOOR A SECOND AND A BOLDER PUSH IT CONTINUED TO YIELD IN SILENCE THE OPENING WAS NOW LARGE ENOUGH TO ALLOW HIM TO PASS
2498-134785-0003 BUT NEAR THE DOOR THERE STOOD A LITTLE TABLE WHICH FORMED AN EMBARRASSING ANGLE WITH IT AND BARRED THE ENTRANCE JEAN VALJEAN RECOGNIZED THE DIFFICULTY
2498-134785-0004 IT WAS NECESSARY AT ANY COST TO ENLARGE THE APERTURE STILL FURTHER HE DECIDED ON HIS COURSE OF ACTION AND GAVE THE DOOR A THIRD PUSH MORE ENERGETIC THAN THE TWO PRECEDING
2498-134785-0005 THIS TIME A BADLY OILED HINGE SUDDENLY EMITTED AMID THE SILENCE A HOARSE AND PROLONGED CRY JEAN VALJEAN SHUDDERED THE NOISE OF THE HINGE RANG IN HIS EARS WITH SOMETHING OF THE PIERCING AND FORMIDABLE SOUND
2498-134785-0006 IN THE FANTASTIC EXAGGERATIONS OF THE FIRST MOMENT HE ALMOST IMAGINED THAT THAT HINGE HAD JUST BECOME ANIMATED AND HAD SUDDENLY ASSUMED A TERRIBLE LIFE
2498-134785-0007 AND THAT IT WAS BARKING LIKE A DOG TO AROUSE EVERY ONE AND WARN AND TO WAKE THOSE WHO WERE ASLEEP HE HALTED SHUDDERING BEWILDERED AND FELL BACK FROM THE TIPS OF HIS TOES UPON HIS HEELS
2498-134785-0008 HE HEARD THE ARTERIES IN HIS TEMPLES BEATING LIKE TWO FORGE HAMMERS AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HIS BREATH ISSUED FROM HIS BREAST WITH THE ROAR OF THE WIND ISSUING FROM A CAVERN IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO HIM THAT THE HORRIBLE CLAMOR
2498-134785-0009 OF THAT IRRITATED HINGE SHOULD NOT HAVE DISTURBED THE ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD LIKE THE SHOCK OF AN EARTHQUAKE THE DOOR PUSHED BY HIM HAD TAKEN THE ALARM AND HAD SHOUTED THE OLD MAN WOULD RISE AT ONCE THE TWO OLD WOMEN WOULD SHRIEK OUT
2498-134785-0010 PEOPLE WOULD COME TO THEIR ASSISTANCE IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THE TOWN WOULD BE IN AN UPROAR AND THE GENDARMERIE ON HAND FOR A MOMENT HE THOUGHT HIMSELF LOST
2498-134785-0011 HE REMAINED WHERE HE WAS PETRIFIED LIKE THE STATUE OF SALT NOT DARING TO MAKE A MOVEMENT SEVERAL MINUTES ELAPSED THE DOOR HAD FALLEN WIDE OPEN HE VENTURED TO PEEP INTO THE NEXT ROOM
2498-134785-0012 NOTHING HAD STIRRED THERE HE LENT AN EAR NOTHING WAS MOVING IN THE HOUSE THE NOISE MADE BY THE RUSTY HINGE HAD NOT AWAKENED ANY ONE
2498-134785-0013 THIS FIRST DANGER WAS PAST BUT THERE STILL REIGNED A FRIGHTFUL TUMULT WITHIN HIM NEVERTHELESS HE DID NOT RETREAT EVEN WHEN HE HAD THOUGHT HIMSELF LOST HE HAD NOT DRAWN BACK
2498-134785-0014 HIS ONLY THOUGHT NOW WAS TO FINISH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HE TOOK A STEP AND ENTERED THE ROOM THIS ROOM WAS IN A STATE OF PERFECT CALM
2498-134785-0015 HERE AND THERE VAGUE AND CONFUSED FORMS WERE DISTINGUISHABLE WHICH IN THE DAYLIGHT WERE PAPERS SCATTERED ON A TABLE OPEN FOLIOS VOLUMES PILED UPON A STOOL AN ARM CHAIR HEAPED WITH CLOTHING
2498-134785-0016 AND WHICH AT THAT HOUR WERE ONLY SHADOWY CORNERS AND WHITISH SPOTS JEAN VALJEAN ADVANCED WITH PRECAUTION TAKING CARE NOT TO KNOCK AGAINST THE FURNITURE
2498-134785-0017 HE COULD HEAR AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE ROOM THE EVEN AND TRANQUIL BREATHING OF THE SLEEPING BISHOP HE SUDDENLY CAME TO A HALT HE WAS NEAR THE BED
2498-134785-0018 HE HAD ARRIVED THERE SOONER THAN HE HAD THOUGHT FOR NATURE SOMETIMES MINGLES HER EFFECTS AND HER SPECTACLES WITH OUR ACTIONS WITH SOMBRE AND INTELLIGENT APPROPRIATENESS
2498-134785-0019 AS THOUGH SHE DESIRED TO MAKE US REFLECT FOR THE LAST HALF HOUR A LARGE CLOUD HAD COVERED THE HEAVENS
2498-134785-0020 THIS CLOUD PARTED AS THOUGH ON PURPOSE AND A RAY OF LIGHT TRAVERSING THE LONG WINDOW SUDDENLY ILLUMINATED THE BISHOP'S PALE FACE HE WAS SLEEPING PEACEFULLY
2498-134785-0021 HE LAY IN HIS BED ALMOST COMPLETELY DRESSED ON ACCOUNT OF THE COLD OF THE BASSES ALPS IN A GARMENT OF BROWN WOOL
2498-134785-0022 HIS HEAD WAS THROWN BACK ON THE PILLOW IN THE CARELESS ATTITUDE OF REPOSE HIS HAND ADORNED WITH THE PASTORAL RING AND WHENCE HAD FALLEN SO MANY GOOD DEEDS AND SO MANY HOLY ACTIONS WAS HANGING OVER THE EDGE OF THE BED
2498-134785-0023 HIS WHOLE FACE WAS ILLUMINED WITH A VAGUE EXPRESSION OF SATISFACTION OF HOPE AND OF FELICITY IT WAS MORE THAN A SMILE AND ALMOST A RADIANCE
2498-134785-0024 HE BORE UPON HIS BROW THE INDESCRIBABLE REFLECTION OF A LIGHT WHICH WAS INVISIBLE THE SOUL OF THE JUST CONTEMPLATES IN SLEEP A MYSTERIOUS HEAVEN
2498-134785-0025 A REFLECTION OF THAT HEAVEN RESTED ON THE BISHOP IT WAS AT THE SAME TIME A LUMINOUS TRANSPARENCY
2498-134785-0026 THAT SLUMBERING NATURE THAT GARDEN WITHOUT A QUIVER THAT HOUSE WHICH WAS SO CALM THE HOUR THE MOMENT THE SILENCE ADDED SOME SOLEMN AND UNSPEAKABLE QUALITY TO THE VENERABLE REPOSE OF THIS MAN
2498-134785-0027 AND ENVELOPED IN A SORT OF SERENE AND MAJESTIC
2498-134785-0028 THOSE CLOSED EYES THAT FACE IN WHICH ALL WAS HOPE AND ALL WAS CONFIDENCE THAT HEAD OF AN OLD MAN AND THAT SLUMBER OF AN INFANT
2498-134785-0029 THERE WAS SOMETHING ALMOST DIVINE IN THIS MAN WHO WAS THUS AUGUST WITHOUT BEING HIMSELF AWARE OF IT JEAN VALJEAN WAS IN THE SHADOW AND STOOD MOTIONLESS
2498-134785-0030 WITH HIS IRON CANDLESTICK IN HIS HAND FRIGHTENED BY THIS LUMINOUS OLD MAN NEVER HAD HE BEHELD ANYTHING LIKE THIS THIS CONFIDENCE TERRIFIED HIM THE MORAL WORLD HAS NO
2498-134785-0031 GRANDER SPECTACLE THAN THIS A TROUBLED AND UNEASY CONSCIENCE WHICH HAS ARRIVED ON THE BRINK OF AN EVIL ACTION CONTEMPLATING THE SLUMBER OF THE JUST THAT SLUMBER IN THAT ISOLATION
2498-134785-0032 AND WITH A NEIGHBOR LIKE HIMSELF HAD ABOUT IT SOMETHING SUBLIME OF WHICH HE WAS VAGUELY BUT IMPERIOUSLY CONSCIOUS NO ONE COULD HAVE TOLD WHAT WAS PASSING WITHIN HIM NOT EVEN HIMSELF
2498-134785-0033 IN ORDER TO ATTEMPT TO FORM AN IDEA OF IT IT IS NECESSARY TO THINK OF THE MOST VIOLENT OF THINGS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MOST GENTLE EVEN ON HIS VISAGE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH ANYTHING WITH CERTAINTY
2498-134785-0034 IT WAS A SORT OF HAGGARD ASTONISHMENT HE GAZED AT IT AND THAT WAS ALL BUT WHAT WAS HIS THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO DIVINE IT WHAT WAS EVIDENT WAS
2498-134785-0035 AND ASTOUNDED BUT WHAT WAS THE NATURE OF THIS EMOTION HIS EYE NEVER QUITTED THE OLD MAN THE ONLY THING WHICH WAS CLEARLY TO BE INFERRED FROM HIS ATTITUDE
2498-134785-0036 WAS A STRANGE INDECISION ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HE WAS HESITATING BETWEEN THE TWO ABYSSES THE ONE IN WHICH ONE LOSES ONE'S SELF AND THAT IN WHICH ONE SAVES ONE'S SELF
2498-134785-0037 HE SEEMED PREPARED TO CRUSH THAT SKULL
2498-134785-0038 AT THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MINUTES HIS LEFT ARM ROSE SLOWLY TOWARDS HIS BROW AND HE TOOK OFF HIS CAP THEN HIS ARM FELL BACK WITH THE SAME DELIBERATION AND JEAN VALJEAN FELL
2498-134785-0039 TO MEDITATING ONCE MORE HIS CAP IN HIS LEFT HAND HIS CLUB IN HIS RIGHT HAND HIS HAIR BRISTLING ALL OVER HIS SAVAGE HEAD THE BISHOP CONTINUED TO SLEEP IN PROFOUND PEACE
2498-134785-0040 BENEATH THAT TERRIFYING GAZE THE GLEAM OF THE MOON RENDERED CONFUSEDLY VISIBLE THE CRUCIFIX OVER THE CHIMNEY PIECE WHICH SEEMED TO BE EXTENDING ITS ARMS TO BOTH OF THEM WITH A BENEDICTION FOR ONE
2498-134785-0041 AND PARDON FOR THE OTHER SUDDENLY JEAN VALJEAN REPLACED HIS CAP ON HIS BROW THEN STEPPED RAPIDLY PAST THE BED
2498-134785-0042 STRAIGHT TO THE CUPBOARD WHICH HE SAW NEAR THE HEAD HE RAISED HIS IRON CANDLESTICK AS THOUGH TO FORCE THE LOCK THE KEY WAS THERE HE OPENED IT THE FIRST THING WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM WAS THE BASKET OF SILVERWARE
