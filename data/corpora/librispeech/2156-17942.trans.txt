2156-17942-0000 HE DREW HER TO HIM UNTIL SHE RESTED AGAINST HIS SHOULDER AND SHE REMAINED THERE TREMBLING IN SUSPENSE GLANCING AT HIM QUICKLY IN BIRDLIKE PLEADING GLANCES AS THOUGH PRAYING HIM TO BE KIND
2156-17942-0001 HE TOOK NO NOTICE AFTER THAT SO THE ACT SEEMED LESS LIKE A CARESS THAN A MATTER OF COURSE HE BEGAN TO TALK HALF HUMOROUSLY AND LITTLE BY LITTLE AS HE WENT ON SHE FORGOT HER FEARS
2156-17942-0002 EVEN HER FEELING OF STRANGENESS AND FELL COMPLETELY UNDER THE SPELL OF HIS POWER MY NAME IS NED TRENT HE TOLD HER AND I AM FROM QUEBEC I AM A WOODS RUNNER
2156-17942-0003 I HAVE JOURNEYED FAR I HAVE BEEN TO THE UTTERMOST ENDS OF THE NORTH EVEN UP BEYOND THE HILLS OF SILENCE AND THEN IN HIS GAY HALF MOCKING YET MUSICAL VOICE
2156-17942-0004 HE TOUCHED LIGHTLY ON VAST AND DISTANT THINGS HE TALKED OF THE GREAT SASKATCHEWAN OF PEACE RIVER AND THE DELTA OF THE MACKENZIE OF THE WINTER JOURNEYS BEYOND GREAT BEAR LAKE INTO THE LAND OF THE LITTLE STICKS
2156-17942-0005 AND THE HALF MYTHICAL LAKE OF YAMBA TOOH HE SPOKE OF LIFE WITH THE DOG RIBS AND YELLOW KNIVES WHERE THE SNOW FALLS IN MIDSUMMER BEFORE HER EYES SLOWLY SPREAD LIKE A PANORAMA
2156-17942-0006 ALL AT ONCE THIS POST OF CONJUROR'S HOUSE A MONTH IN THE WILDERNESS AS IT WAS SEEMED VERY SMALL AND TAME AND CIVILIZED FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT DEATH DID NOT ALWAYS COMPASS IT ABOUT
2156-17942-0007 IT WAS VERY COLD THEN SAID NED TRENT AND VERY HARD
2156-17942-0008 AT NIGHT WE HAD NO OTHER SHELTER THAN OUR BLANKETS AND WE COULD NOT KEEP A FIRE BECAUSE THE SPRUCE BURNED TOO FAST AND THREW TOO MANY COALS FOR A LONG TIME WE SHIVERED CURLED UP ON OUR SNOW SHOES
2156-17942-0009 THEN FELL HEAVILY ASLEEP SO THAT EVEN THE DOGS FIGHTING OVER US DID NOT AWAKEN US TWO OR THREE TIMES IN THE NIGHT WE BOILED TEA
2156-17942-0010 WE HAD TO THAW OUR MOCCASINS EACH MORNING BY THRUSTING THEM INSIDE OUR SHIRTS EVEN THE INDIANS WERE SHIVERING AND SAYING ED SA YAZZI ED SA'
2156-17942-0011 BUT AS HE WENT ON IN SHORT CURT SENTENCES THE PICTURE GREW MORE DISTINCT AND TO VIRGINIA THE MAN BECAME MORE AND MORE PROMINENT IN IT SHE SAW THE DYING AND EXHAUSTED DOGS
2156-17942-0012 THE SHRIVELLING BITE OF THE FROST THE PAIN OF SNOW BLINDNESS THE HUNGER THAT YET COULD NOT STOMACH THE FROZEN FISH NOR THE HAIRY BLACK CARIBOU MEAT ONE THING SHE COULD NOT CONCEIVE
2156-17942-0013 THE INDOMITABLE SPIRIT OF THE MEN SHE GLANCED TIMIDLY UP AT HER COMPANION'S FACE THE COMPANY IS A CRUEL MASTER SHE SIGHED AT LAST STANDING UPRIGHT
2156-17942-0014 ARE YOU NOT OF THE COMPANY I AM NO MAN'S MAN BUT MY OWN HE ANSWERED SIMPLY THEN WHY DO YOU STAY IN THIS DREADFUL NORTH SHE ASKED
2156-17942-0015 BECAUSE I LOVE IT IT IS MY LIFE I WANT TO GO WHERE NO MAN HAS SET FOOT BEFORE ME I WANT TO STAND ALONE UNDER THE SKY I WANT TO SHOW MYSELF THAT NOTHING IS TOO BIG FOR ME
2156-17942-0016 THIS IS NOT SO DREADFUL AS THE COPPERMINE AND THE COUNTRY OF THE YELLOW KNIVES DID YOU COME HERE TO TRY LA LONGUE TRAVERSE OF WHICH YOU SPOKE TO DAY
2156-17942-0017 HE FELL SUDDENLY SOMBRE BITING IN REFLECTION AT HIS LIP NO YES WHY NOT HE SAID AT LENGTH I KNOW YOU WILL COME OUT OF IT SAFELY SAID SHE
2156-17942-0018 I FEEL IT YOU ARE BRAVE AND USED TO TRAVEL WON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT HE DID NOT REPLY AFTER A MOMENT SHE LOOKED UP IN SURPRISE
2156-17942-0019 HIS BROWS WERE KNIT IN REFLECTION HE TURNED TO HER AGAIN HIS EYES GLOWING INTO HERS ONCE MORE THE FASCINATION OF THE MAN GREW BIG OVERWHELMED HER SHE FELT HER HEART FLUTTER
2156-17942-0020 HER CONSCIOUSNESS SWIM HER OLD TERROR RETURNING LISTEN SAID HE I MAY COME TO YOU TO MORROW AND ASK YOU TO CHOOSE BETWEEN YOUR DIVINE PITY AND WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK TO BE YOUR DUTY
2156-17942-0021 THEN I WILL TELL YOU ALL THERE IS TO KNOW OF LA LONGUE TRAVERSE NOW IT IS A SECRET OF THE COMPANY YOU ARE A FACTOR'S DAUGHTER YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS HE DROPPED HIS HEAD
2156-17942-0022 AH I AM TIRED TIRED WITH IT ALL HE CRIED IN A VOICE STRANGELY UNHAPPY BUT YESTERDAY I PLAYED THE GAME WITH ALL MY OLD SPIRIT TO DAY THE ZEST IS GONE
2156-17942-0023 UNHAPPINESS IS WORTH SUCH PITY AS YOURS HE BROODED FOR A MOMENT THEN THREW HIS HANDS OUT WITH WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GESTURE OF DESPERATE INDIFFERENCE
2156-17942-0024 SHE CRIED IN INSULTED ANGER OH SHE CRIED IN A RED SHAME OH SHE CRIED IN SORROW HER CALM BROKE
2156-17942-0025 HE STAMPED HIS MOCCASINED FOOT IMPATIENTLY LIKE A RAT IN A TRAP HE JEERED AT HIMSELF LIKE A RAT IN A TRAP NED TRENT THE FATES ARE DRAWING AROUND YOU CLOSE
2156-17942-0026 CAN YOU EVER FORGET HER FRIGHTENED WHITE FACE BEGGING YOU TO BE KIND HE PACED BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO BRONZE GUNS WITH LONG STRAIGHT STRIDES LIKE A PANTHER IN A CAGE
2156-17942-0027 BUT SHE MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ASK I COULD NOT DO IT BETTER TRY LA LONGUE TRAVERSE THAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HER PITY SHE'D SURELY GET INTO TROUBLE WHAT WONDERFUL EYES SHE HAS
2156-17942-0028 SHE THINKS I AM A BRUTE HOW SHE SOBBED AS THOUGH HER LITTLE HEART HAD BROKEN WELL IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO DESTROY HER INTEREST IN ME I HAD TO DO IT
2156-17942-0029 NOW SHE WILL DESPISE ME AND FORGET ME IT IS BETTER THAT SHE SHOULD THINK ME A BRUTE THAN THAT I SHOULD BE ALWAYS HAUNTED BY THOSE PLEADING EYES THE DOOR OF THE DISTANT CHURCH HOUSE OPENED AND CLOSED
2156-17942-0030 HE SMILED BITTERLY TO BE SURE I HAVEN'T TRIED THAT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR TEACHINGS ARE SINGULARLY APROPOS TO MY CASE MERCY JUSTICE HUMANITY
2156-17942-0031 YES AND LOVE OF MAN I'LL TRY IT I'LL CALL FOR HELP ON THE LOVE OF MAN SINCE I CANNOT ON THE LOVE OF WOMAN THE LOVE OF WOMAN
