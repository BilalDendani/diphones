1066-103481-0000 GILDING OLD RUINS WITH HER JASMINE SPRAY DISTILLING WARM MOIST PERFUME FROM CHILL WINTER SHADE OUT OF THE SOUTH SHE BROUGHT THE WHISPERINGS OF QUESTING WINGS
1066-103481-0001 THEN FLAME ON FLAME THE CARDINALS CAME BLOWING LIKE DRIVEN BRANDS UP FROM THE SULTRY LANDS WHERE SUMMER'S HAPPY FIRES ALWAYS BURN OLD SILENCES THAT PAIN HAD HELD TOO CLOSE AND LONG STIRRED TO THE MOCKER'S SONG
1066-103481-0002 AND HOPE LOOKED OUT AGAIN FROM TIRED EYES DOWN WHERE THE WHITE POINT GARDENS DRANK THE SUN AND RIPPLED TO THE LIFT OF SPRINGING GRASS THE WOMEN CAME AND AFTER THEM THE AGED AND THE LAME THAT WAR HAD HURLED BACK AT THEM LIKE A TAUNT
1066-103481-0003 THRUSTING OUT OF THE MISTS LIKE HOSTILE FISTS WAITED THE CLOSE BLOCKADE THEN DIM TO LEFT AND RIGHT THE CURVING ISLANDS WITH THEIR SHATTERED MOUNDS THAT HAD BEEN FORTS
1066-103481-0004 MOUNDS WHICH IN SPITE OF FOUR LONG YEARS OF RENDING AGONY STILL HELD AGAINST THE LIGHT FAINT WRAITHS OF COLOR FOR THE BREEZE TO LIFT AND FLATTEN INTO FADED RED AND WHITE THESE SUNNY ISLANDS WERE NOT MEANT FOR WARS
1066-103481-0005 SEE HOW THEY CURVE AWAY BEFORE THE BAY BIDDING THE VOYAGER PAUSE WARM WITH THE HOARDED SUNS OF CENTURIES YOUNG WITH THE GARNERED YOUTH OF MANY SPRINGS THEY LAUGH LIKE HAPPY BATHERS WHILE THE SEAS BREAK IN THEIR OPEN ARMS
1066-103481-0006 AND THE SLOW MOVING BREEZE DRAWS LANGUID FINGERS DOWN THEIR PLACID BROWS EVEN THE SURLY OCEAN KNOWS THEIR CHARMS AND UNDER THE SHRILL LAUGHTER OF THE SURF HE BOOMS AND SINGS HIS HEAVY MONOTONE TWO
1066-103481-0007 THERE ARE RARE NIGHTS AMONG THESE WATERWAYS WHEN SPRING FIRST TREADS THE MEADOWS OF THE MARSH LEAVING FAINT FOOTPRINTS OF ELUSIVE GREEN TO GLIMMER AS SHE STRAYS BREAKING THE WINTER SILENCE WITH THE HARSH SHARP CALL OF WATERFOWL
1066-103481-0008 RUBBING DIM SHIFTING PASTELS IN THE SCENE WITH WHITE OF MOON AND BLUR OF SCUDDING CLOUD UNTIL THE MYRTLE THICKETS AND THE SAND THE SILENT STREAMS AND THE SUBSTANTIAL LAND GO DRIFTING DOWN THE TIDE OF NIGHT ASWOON
1066-103481-0009 ON SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS I SAW THE LAST CREW GO OUT OF A WORLD TOO BEAUTIFUL TO LEAVE ONLY A CHOSEN FEW BESIDE THE CREW WERE GATHERED ON THE PIER
1066-103481-0010 AND IN THE EBB AND FLOW OF DARK AND MOON WE SAW THEM FARE STRAIGHT PAST THE ROW OF COFFINS WHERE THE FIFTH CREW LAY WAITING THEIR LAST SHORT VOYAGE ACROSS THE BAY AND AS THEY WENT NOT ONE AMONG THEM SWERVED
1066-103481-0011 BUT EYES WENT HOMING SWIFTLY TO THE WEST WHERE FAINT AND VERY FEW THE WINDOWS OF THE TOWN CALLED OUT TO THEM YET HELD THEM NERVED AND READY FOR THE TEST YOUNG EVERY ONE THEY BROUGHT LIFE AT ITS BEST
1066-103481-0012 IN THE TAUT STILLNESS NOT A WORD WAS UTTERED BUT ONE HEARD THE DEEP SLOW ORCHESTRATION OF THE NIGHT SWELL AND RELAPSE AS SWIFTLY ONE BY ONE CUTTING A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE GRAY THEY ROSE
1066-103481-0013 THEN DROPPED OUT SOFTLY LIKE A DREAM INTO THE ROCKING SHADOWS OF THE STREAM A SUDDEN GRIND OF METAL SCARRED THE HUSH A MARSH HEN THRESHED THE WATER WITH HER WINGS AND FOR A BREATH THE MARSH LIFE WOKE AND THROBBED
1066-103481-0014 THEN DOWN BENEATH OUR FEET WE CAUGHT THE GLEAM OF FOLDED WATER FLARING LEFT AND RIGHT WHILE WITH A NOISELESS RUSH A SHADOW DARKER THAN THE REST DREW FROM ITS FELLOWS SWARMING ROUND THE QUAY TOOK AN ONCOMING BREAKER
1066-103481-0015 SHOOK ITS SHOULDERS FREE AND FACED THE SEA THEN CAME AN INTERVAL THAT SEEMED TO BE PART OF ETERNITY YEARS MIGHT HAVE PASSED OR SECONDS NO ONE KNEW CLOSE IN THE DARK WE HUDDLED EACH TO EACH
1066-103481-0016 TOO STIRRED FOR SPEECH OUR SENSES SHARPENED TO AN AGONY DREW OUT ACROSS THE WATER TILL THE ACHE WAS MORE THAN WE COULD BEAR TILL EYES COULD ALMOST SEE EARS ALMOST HEAR
1066-103481-0017 AND WAITING THERE I SEEMED TO FEEL THE BEACH SLIP FROM MY REACH WHILE ALL THE STARS WENT BLANK THE SMELL OF OIL AND DEATH ENVELOPED ME AND I COULD FEEL THE CROUCHING FIGURES STRAINING AT A CRANK KNEES UNDER CHINS
1066-103481-0018 THE SOB AND GASP OF BREATH AGAINST AN AIR EMPTY AND DAMP AND FETID AS A TOMB WITH THEM I SEEMED TO REEL BENEATH THE SPIN AND HEEL WHEN COMBERS TOOK THEM FAIR
1066-103481-0019 THREE A SUDDEN FLOOD OF MOONLIGHT DRENCHED THE SEA POINTING THE SCENE IN SHARP STRONG BLACK AND WHITE SUMTER CAME SHOULDERING THROUGH THE NIGHT BATTERED AND GRIM
1066-103481-0020 THE CURVE OF SHIPS SHOOK OFF THEIR DIM VAGUE OUTLINES OF A DREAM AND STOOD PATIENT AS DEATH SO CERTAIN IN THEIR PRIDE SO SATISFIED TO WAIT THE SLOW INEVITABLENESS OF FATE CLOSE WHERE THE CHANNEL NARROWED TO THE BAY
1066-103481-0021 HER WIDE HIGH SWEEP OF SPARS FLAUNTING THEIR ARROGANCE AMONG THE STARS DARKNESS AGAIN SWIFT WINGED AND ABSOLUTE GULPING THE STARS FOLDING THE SHIPS AND SEA HOLDING US WAITING MUTE
1066-103481-0022 A SHIP OF LIGHT OUT OF A MOLTEN SEA HANG AN UNENDING PULSE BEAT GLOWING STARK WHILE THE HOT CLOUDS FLUNG BACK A SULLEN ROAR THEN ALL HER PRIDE SO CONFIDENT AND SURE WENT REELING DOWN THE DARK
1066-103481-0023 OUT OF THE BLACKNESS WAVE ON LIVID WAVE LEAPT INTO BEING THUNDERED TO OUR FEET COUNTING THE MOMENTS FOR US BEAT BY BEAT UNTIL THE LAST AND SMALLEST DWINDLED PAST
1066-103481-0024 TRAILING ITS PALLOR LIKE A WINDING SHEET OVER THE LAST CREW AND ITS CHOSEN GRAVE
1066-103481-0025 AND THE VESSEL HULL DOWN IN THE SEA WHERE THE WATERS JUST STIRRING FROM SLEEP LIFTED BRIGHT HANDS TO THE SUN HIDING THEIR LUSTY YOUNG DEAD HOLDING THEM JEALOUSLY CLOSE DOWN TO THE COLD HARBOR FLOOR
1066-103481-0026 EACH HUDDLED DUMBLY TO EACH BUT EYES COULD NOT LIFT FROM THE SEA ONLY HANDS TOUCHED IN THE DAWN HE WOULD HAVE GONE MY MAN HE WAS LIKE THAT IN THE NIGHT WHEN I AWOKE WITH A START AND BROUGHT HIS VOICE UP FROM MY DREAM
1066-103481-0027 THAT WAS GOODBYE AND GODSPEED I KNOW HE IS THERE WITH THE REST BRAVE BUT WITH QUIVERING LIPS EACH ALONE IN THE PRESS OF THE CROWD WAS SAYING IT OVER AND OVER
1066-103481-0028 THE DAY FLOODED ALL OF THE SKY AND THE SHIPS OF THE SULLEN BLOCKADE WEIGHED ANCHOR AND DREW DOWN THE WIND LEAVING THEIR WRECK TO THE WAVES HOUR HEAVED SLOWLY ON HOUR
1066-103481-0029 YET HOW COULD THE CITY REJOICE WITH THE WOMEN OUT THERE BY THE WALL NIGHT GREW UNDER THE WHARVES AND CREPT THROUGH THE LISTENING STREETS UNTIL ONLY THE RED OF THE TILES SEEMED WARM FROM THE BREATH OF THE DAY
1066-103481-0030 AND THE FACES THAT WAITED AND WATCHED BLURRED INTO A WAVERING LINE LIKE FOAM ON THE CURVE OF THE DARK DOWN THERE BY THE RETICENT SEA WHAT IF THE DARKNESS SHOULD BRING THE LEAN BLOCKADE RUNNERS ACROSS WITH FOOD FOR THE HUNGRY AND SPENT
