5802-76043-0000 SECTION THREE IN THE EVENING AFTER DINNER DOCTOR MARTINEAU SOUGHT RATHER UNSUCCESSFULLY TO GO ON WITH THE ANALYSIS OF SIR RICHMOND BUT SIR RICHMOND WAS EVIDENTLY A CREATURE OF MOODS
5802-76043-0001 EITHER HE REGRETTED THE EXTENT OF HIS CONFIDENCES OR THE SLIGHT IRRATIONAL IRRITATION THAT HE FELT AT WAITING FOR HIS CAR AFFECTED HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS HIS COMPANION OR DOCTOR MARTINEAU'S TENTATIVES WERE ILL CHOSEN AT ANY RATE
5802-76043-0002 HE WOULD NOT RISE TO ANY CONVERSATIONAL BAIT THAT THE DOCTOR COULD DEVISE THE DOCTOR FOUND THIS THE MORE REGRETTABLE BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WAS MUCH TO BE WORKED UPON IN THIS MARTIN LEEDS AFFAIR HE WAS INCLINED TO THINK THAT SHE AND SIR RICHMOND WERE UNDULY OBSESSED BY THE IDEA THAT THEY HAD TO STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE CHILD
5802-76043-0003 BECAUSE OF THE LOOK OF THE THING AND SO FORTH AND THAT REALLY EACH MIGHT BE STRUGGLING AGAINST A VERY STRONG IMPULSE INDEED TO BREAK OFF THE AFFAIR IT SEEMED EVIDENT TO THE DOCTOR THAT THEY JARRED UPON AND ANNOYED EACH OTHER EXTREMELY
5802-76043-0004 AT THE FIFTH SIR RICHMOND WAS SUDDENLY CONCLUSIVE IT'S NO USE HE SAID I CAN'T FIDDLE ABOUT ANY MORE WITH MY MOTIVES TO DAY AN AWKWARD SILENCE FOLLOWED ON REFLECTION SIR RICHMOND SEEMED TO REALIZE THAT THIS SENTENCE NEEDED SOME APOLOGY I ADMIT
5802-76043-0005 HE SAID THAT THIS EXPEDITION HAS ALREADY BEEN A WONDERFULLY GOOD THING FOR ME THESE CONFESSIONS HAVE MADE ME LOOK INTO ALL SORTS OF THINGS SQUARELY BUT I'M NOT USED TO TALKING ABOUT MYSELF OR EVEN THINKING DIRECTLY ABOUT MYSELF
5802-76043-0006 WHAT I SAY I AFTERWARDS FIND DISCONCERTING TO RECALL I WANT TO ALTER IT I CAN FEEL MYSELF WALLOWING INTO A MESS OF MODIFICATIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS YES BUT I WANT A REST ANYHOW THERE WAS NOTHING FOR DOCTOR MARTINEAU TO SAY TO THAT
5802-76043-0007 THE TWO GENTLEMEN SMOKED FOR SOME TIME IN A SLIGHTLY UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE DOCTOR MARTINEAU CLEARED HIS THROAT TWICE AND LIT A SECOND CIGAR THEY THEN AGREED TO ADMIRE THE BRIDGE AND THINK WELL OF MAIDENHEAD SIR RICHMOND COMMUNICATED HOPEFUL NEWS ABOUT HIS CAR
5802-76043-0008 SIR RICHMOND'S CAR ARRIVED LONG BEFORE TEN BROUGHT DOWN BY A YOUNG MAN IN A STATE OF SCARED ALACRITY SIR RICHMOND HAD DONE SOME VIGOROUS TELEPHONING BEFORE TURNING IN THE CHARMEUSE SET OFF IN A REPAIRED AND CHASTENED CONDITION TO TOWN
5802-76043-0009 AND AFTER A LEISURELY BREAKFAST OUR TWO INVESTIGATORS INTO THE SPRINGS OF HUMAN CONDUCT WERE ABLE TO RESUME THEIR WESTWARD JOURNEY THEY RAN THROUGH SCATTERED TWYFORD WITH ITS PLEASANT LOOKING INNS AND THROUGH THE COMMONPLACE URBANITIES OF READING
5802-76043-0010 WHERE THEY FOUND THE ROAD HEAVY AND DUSTY STILL IN ITS WAR TIME STATE AND SO DOWN A STEEP HILL TO THE WIDE MARKET STREET WHICH IS MARLBOROUGH THEY LUNCHED IN MARLBOROUGH AND WENT ON IN THE AFTERNOON TO SILBURY HILL THAT BRITISH PYRAMID THE LARGEST ARTIFICIAL MOUND IN EUROPE
5802-76043-0011 AND WERE VERY LEARNED AND INCONCLUSIVE ABOUT THE EXACT PURPOSE OF THIS VAST HEAP OF CHALK AND EARTH THIS HEAP THAT MEN HAD MADE BEFORE THE TEMPLES AT KARNAK WERE BUILT OR BABYLON HAD A NAME THEN THEY RETURNED TO THE CAR AND RAN ROUND BY A WINDING ROAD INTO THE WONDER OF AVEBURY
5802-76043-0012 AND TOOK TWO ROOMS FOR THE NIGHT THAT THEY MIGHT THE BETTER GET THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE ANCIENT PLACE WONDERFUL INDEED IT IS A VAST CIRCUMVALLATION THAT WAS ALREADY TWO THOUSAND YEARS OLD BEFORE THE DAWN OF BRITISH HISTORY
5802-76043-0013 AND WITHIN THIS ENCLOSURE GIGANTIC SURVIVORS OF THE GREAT CIRCLES OF UNHEWN STONE THAT EVEN AS LATE AS TUDOR DAYS WERE ALMOST COMPLETE A WHOLE VILLAGE A CHURCH A PRETTY MANOR HOUSE HAVE BEEN BUILT FOR THE MOST PART OUT OF THE ANCIENT MEGALITHS
5802-76043-0014 THE GREAT WALL IS SUFFICIENT TO EMBRACE THEM ALL WITH THEIR GARDENS AND PADDOCKS FOUR CROSS ROADS MEET AT THE VILLAGE CENTRE
5802-76043-0015 BUT FOR THE MOST PART THE DESTRUCTION WAS ALREADY DONE BEFORE THE MAYFLOWER SAILED TO THE SOUTHWARD STANDS THE CONE OF SILBURY HILL ITS SHADOW CREEPS UP AND DOWN THE INTERVENING MEADOWS AS THE SEASONS CHANGE
5802-76043-0016 AROUND THIS LONELY PLACE RISE THE DOWNS NOW BARE SHEEP PASTURES IN BROAD UNDULATIONS WITH A WART LIKE BARROW HERE AND THERE AND FROM IT RADIATE CREEPING UP TO GAIN AND HOLD THE CRESTS OF THE HILLS THE ABANDONED TRACKWAYS OF THAT FORGOTTEN WORLD
5802-76043-0017 THESE TRACKWAYS THESE GREEN ROADS OF ENGLAND THESE ROADS ALREADY DISUSED WHEN THE ROMANS MADE THEIR HIGHWAY PAST SILBURY HILL TO BATH CAN STILL BE TRACED FOR SCORES OF MILES THROUGH THE LAND RUNNING TO SALISBURY AND THE ENGLISH CHANNEL
5802-76043-0018 EASTWARD TO THE CROSSING AT THE STRAITS AND WESTWARD TO WALES TO FERRIES OVER THE SEVERN AND SOUTHWESTWARD INTO DEVON AND CORNWALL THE DOCTOR AND SIR RICHMOND WALKED ROUND THE WALLS SURVEYED THE SHADOW CAST BY SILBURY UPON THE RIVER FLATS
5802-76043-0019 STROLLED UP THE DOWN TO THE NORTHWARD TO GET A GENERAL VIEW OF THE VILLAGE HAD TEA AND SMOKED ROUND THE WALLS AGAIN IN THE WARM APRIL SUNSET THE MATTER OF THEIR CONVERSATION REMAINED PREHISTORIC
5802-76043-0020 CLUMSY TREASURE HUNTING SIR RICHMOND SAID THEY BORE INTO SILBURY HILL AND EXPECT TO FIND A MUMMIFIED CHIEF OR SOMETHING SENSATIONAL OF THAT SORT AND THEY DON'T AND THEY REPORT NOTHING THEY HAVEN'T SIFTED FINELY ENOUGH
5802-76043-0021 THESE WALLS OF EARTH OUGHT TO TELL WHAT THESE PEOPLE ATE WHAT CLOTHES THEY WORE WHAT WOODS THEY USED WAS THIS A SHEEP LAND THEN AS IT IS NOW OR A CATTLE LAND WERE THESE HILLS COVERED BY FORESTS I DON'T KNOW THESE ARCHAEOLOGISTS DON'T KNOW
5802-76043-0022 OR IF THEY DO THEY HAVEN'T TOLD ME WHICH IS JUST AS BAD I DON'T BELIEVE THEY KNOW
5802-76043-0023 SO FAR AS I KNOW THEY HAD NO BEASTS OF BURTHEN BUT SUPPOSE ONE DAY SOMEONE WERE TO FIND A POTSHERD HERE FROM EARLY KNOSSOS OR A FRAGMENT OF GLASS FROM PEPI'S EGYPT THE PLACE HAD STIRRED UP HIS IMAGINATION
5802-76043-0024 HE WRESTLED WITH HIS IGNORANCE AS IF HE THOUGHT THAT BY TALKING HE MIGHT PRESENTLY WORRY OUT SOME PICTURE OF THIS FORGOTTEN WORLD WITHOUT METALS WITHOUT BEASTS OF BURTHEN WITHOUT LETTERS WITHOUT ANY SCULPTURE THAT HAS LEFT A TRACE AND YET WITH A SENSE OF ASTRONOMICAL FACT CLEAR ENOUGH TO RAISE THE GREAT GNOMON OF SILBURY
5802-76043-0025 AND THE TRAFFIC TO WHICH THE GREEN ROADS TESTIFY THE DOCTOR HAD NOT REALIZED BEFORE THE BOLDNESS AND LIVELINESS OF HIS COMPANION'S MIND SIR RICHMOND INSISTED THAT THE CLIMATE MUST HAVE BEEN MOISTER AND MILDER IN THOSE DAYS HE COVERED ALL THE DOWNLANDS WITH WOODS
5802-76043-0026 BENEATH THE TREES HE RESTORED A THICKER RICHER SOIL THESE PEOPLE MUST HAVE DONE AN ENORMOUS LOT WITH WOOD THIS USE OF STONES HERE WAS A FREAK
5802-76043-0027 ONE THOUGHT TOO MUCH OF THE STONES OF THE STONE AGE WHO WOULD CARVE THESE LUMPS OF QUARTZITE WHEN ONE COULD CARVE GOOD OAK OR BEECH A MOST CARVABLE WOOD ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE'S SHARPEST CHISEL WAS A FLINT IT'S WOOD WE OUGHT TO LOOK FOR
5802-76043-0028 SAID SIR RICHMOND WOOD AND FIBRE HE DECLARED THAT THESE PEOPLE HAD THEIR TOOLS OF WOOD THEIR HOMES OF WOOD
5802-76043-0029 A PEAT BOG HERE EVEN A FEW FEET OF CLAY MIGHT HAVE PICKLED SOME PRECIOUS MEMORANDA NO SUCH LUCK NOW IN GLASTONBURY MARSHES ONE FOUND THE LIFE OF THE EARLY IRON AGE HALF WAY TO OUR OWN TIMES QUITE BEAUTIFULLY PICKLED
5802-76043-0030 THOUGH THEY WRESTLED MIGHTILY WITH THE PROBLEM NEITHER SIR RICHMOND NOR THE DOCTOR COULD THROW A GLEAM OF LIGHT UPON THE RIDDLE WHY THE DITCH WAS INSIDE AND NOT OUTSIDE THE GREAT WALL AND WHAT WAS OUR MIND LIKE IN THOSE DAYS SAID SIR RICHMOND
5802-76043-0031 THAT I SUPPOSE IS WHAT INTERESTS YOU A VIVID CHILDISH MIND I GUESS WITH NOT A SUSPICION AS YET THAT IT WAS MAN RULING HIS PLANET OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT THE DOCTOR PURSED HIS LIPS NONE HE DELIVERED JUDICIALLY
5802-76043-0032 IF ONE WERE ABLE TO RECALL ONE'S CHILDHOOD AT THE AGE OF ABOUT TWELVE OR THIRTEEN WHEN THE ARTISTIC IMPULSE SO OFTEN GOES INTO ABEYANCE AND ONE BEGINS TO THINK IN A TROUBLED MONSTROUS WAY ABOUT GOD AND HELL
5802-76043-0033 ONE MIGHT GET SOMETHING LIKE THE MIND OF THIS PLACE THIRTEEN YOU PUT THEM AT THAT ALREADY THESE PEOPLE YOU THINK WERE RELIGIOUS INTENSELY IN THAT PERSONAL WAY THAT GIVES DEATH A NIGHTMARE TERROR
5802-76043-0034 AND AS FOR THE FADING OF THE ARTISTIC IMPULSE THEY'VE LEFT NOT A TRACE OF THE PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS AND SCRATCHINGS OF THE OLD STONE PEOPLE WHO CAME BEFORE THEM ADULTS WITH THE MINDS OF THIRTEEN YEAR OLD CHILDREN THIRTEEN YEAR OLD CHILDREN WITH THE STRENGTH OF ADULTS
5802-76043-0035 AND NO ONE TO SLAP THEM OR TELL THEM NOT TO AFTER ALL THEY PROBABLY ONLY THOUGHT OF DEATH NOW AND THEN AND THEY NEVER THOUGHT OF FUEL THEY SUPPOSED THERE WAS NO END TO THAT SO THEY USED UP THEIR WOODS AND KEPT GOATS TO NIBBLE AND KILL THE NEW UNDERGROWTH DID THESE PEOPLE HAVE GOATS
5802-76043-0036 I DON'T KNOW SAID THE DOCTOR SO LITTLE IS KNOWN VERY LIKE CHILDREN THEY MUST HAVE BEEN THE SAME UNENDING DAYS
5802-76043-0037 LIKE MY DAMNED COMMITTEE DOES WITH THEIR FUEL WASTING AWAY AND THE CLIMATE CHANGING IMPERCEPTIBLY CENTURY BY CENTURY KINGS AND IMPORTANT MEN FOLLOWED ONE ANOTHER HERE FOR CENTURIES AND CENTURIES
5802-76043-0038 SAID THE DOCTOR HAS LEFT ITS TRACES IN TRADITIONS IN MENTAL PREDISPOSITIONS IN STILL UNANALYZED FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS ARCHAEOLOGY IS VERY LIKE REMEMBERING SAID SIR RICHMOND PRESENTLY WE SHALL REMEMBER A LOT MORE ABOUT ALL THIS
5802-76043-0039 AGE BY AGE OUT OF THE SOUTH WE SHALL REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES WE MADE AND THE CRAZY REASONS WHY WE MADE THEM WE SOWED OUR CORN IN BLOOD HERE WE HAD STRANGE FANCIES ABOUT THE STARS THOSE WE BROUGHT WITH US OUT OF THE SOUTH WHERE THE STARS ARE BRIGHTER
5802-76043-0040 AND WHAT LIKE WERE THOSE WOODEN GODS OF OURS I DON'T REMEMBER BUT I COULD EASILY PERSUADE MYSELF THAT I HAD BEEN HERE BEFORE
5802-76043-0041 PERHAPS WE SHALL COME HERE AGAIN THE DOCTOR CARRIED ON SIR RICHMOND'S FANCY AFTER ANOTHER FOUR THOUSAND YEARS OR SO WITH DIFFERENT NAMES AND FULLER MINDS AND THEN I SUPPOSE THAT THIS DITCH WON'T BE THE RIDDLE IT IS NOW
5802-76043-0042 LIFE DIDN'T SEEM SO COMPLICATED THEN SIR RICHMOND MUSED OUR MUDDLES WERE UNCONSCIOUS WE DRIFTED FROM MOOD TO MOOD AND FORGOT THERE WAS MORE SUNSHINE THEN MORE LAUGHTER PERHAPS AND BLACKER DESPAIR
5802-76043-0043 DESPAIR LIKE THE DESPAIR OF CHILDREN THAT CAN WEEP ITSELF TO SLEEP IT'S OVER WAS IT BATTLE AND MASSACRE THAT ENDED THAT LONG AFTERNOON HERE OR DID THE WOODS CATCH FIRE SOME EXCEPTIONALLY DRY SUMMER LEAVING BLACK HILLS AND FAMINE
5802-76043-0044 OR DID STRANGE MEN BRING A SICKNESS MEASLES PERHAPS OR THE BLACK DEATH OR WAS IT CATTLE PEST OR DID WE JUST WASTE OUR WOODS AND DWINDLE AWAY BEFORE THE NEW PEOPLES THAT CAME INTO THE LAND ACROSS THE SOUTHERN SEA I CAN'T REMEMBER
5802-76043-0045 SIR RICHMOND TURNED ABOUT I WOULD LIKE TO DIG UP THE BOTTOM OF THIS DITCH HERE FOOT BY FOOT AND DRY THE STUFF AND SIFT IT VERY CAREFULLY
