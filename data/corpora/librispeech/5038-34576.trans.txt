5038-34576-0000 THE WIND WAS NOW DIMINISHING A SIGN HOWEVER OF A VIOLENT RECURRENCE IMPENDING THE CHILD WAS ON THE TABLE LAND AT THE EXTREME SOUTH POINT OF PORTLAND PORTLAND
5038-34576-0001 IS A PENINSULA BUT THE CHILD DID NOT KNOW WHAT A PENINSULA IS AND WAS IGNORANT EVEN OF THE NAME OF PORTLAND HE KNEW BUT ONE THING WHICH IS THAT ONE CAN WALK UNTIL ONE DROPS DOWN
5038-34576-0002 AN IDEA IS A GUIDE HE HAD NO IDEA THEY HAD BROUGHT HIM THERE AND LEFT HIM THERE THEY AND THERE THESE TWO ENIGMAS REPRESENTED HIS DOOM
5038-34576-0003 THEY WERE HUMANKIND THERE WAS THE UNIVERSE FOR HIM IN ALL CREATION THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER BASIS TO REST ON BUT THE LITTLE PIECE OF GROUND
5038-34576-0004 AROUND HIM WAS THE VASTNESS OF HUMAN DESERTION HE CROSSED THE FIRST PLATEAU DIAGONALLY THEN A SECOND THEN A THIRD AT THE EXTREMITY OF EACH PLATEAU
5038-34576-0005 RESEMBLE GREAT FLAGSTONES OVERLAPPING EACH OTHER THE SOUTH SIDE SEEMS TO ENTER UNDER THE PROTRUDING SLAB THE NORTH SIDE RISES OVER THE NEXT ONE THESE MADE ASCENTS WHICH
5038-34576-0006 THE CHILD STEPPED OVER NIMBLY FROM TIME TO TIME HE STOPPED AND SEEMED TO HOLD COUNSEL WITH HIMSELF THE NIGHT WAS BECOMING VERY DARK HIS RADIUS OF SIGHT WAS CONTRACTING
5038-34576-0007 WHICH HE DIMLY PERCEIVED ON HIS RIGHT AT THE POINT OF THE PLAIN NEAREST THE CLIFF THERE WAS ON THE EMINENCE A SHAPE WHICH IN THE MIST LOOKED LIKE A TREE
5038-34576-0008 THE CHILD HAD JUST HEARD A NOISE IN THIS DIRECTION WHICH WAS THE NOISE NEITHER OF THE WIND NOR OF THE SEA NOR WAS IT THE CRY OF ANIMALS
5038-34576-0009 HE THOUGHT THAT SOME ONE WAS THERE AND IN A FEW STRIDES HE WAS AT THE FOOT OF THE HILLOCK IN TRUTH SOME ONE WAS THERE THAT WHICH HAD BEEN
5038-34576-0010 SUPPORTED FROM BENEATH BY THE THUMB POINTED OUT HORIZONTALLY THE ARM THE THUMB AND THE FOREFINGER DREW A SQUARE AGAINST THE SKY AT THE POINT OF JUNCTURE
5038-34576-0011 OF THIS PECULIAR FINGER AND THIS PECULIAR THUMB THERE WAS A LINE FROM WHICH HUNG SOMETHING BLACK AND SHAPELESS THE LINE MOVING IN THE WIND SOUNDED LIKE A CHAIN
5038-34576-0012 THIS WAS THE NOISE THE CHILD HAD HEARD SEEN CLOSELY THE LINE WAS THAT WHICH THE NOISE INDICATED A CHAIN A SINGLE CHAIN CABLE BY THAT MYSTERIOUS LAW OF AMALGAMATION
5038-34576-0013 WHICH THROUGHOUT NATURE CAUSES APPEARANCES TO EXAGGERATE REALITIES THE PLACE THE HOUR THE MIST THE MOURNFUL SEA THE CLOUDY TURMOILS ON THE DISTANT HORIZON ADDED TO THE EFFECT OF THIS FIGURE
5038-34576-0014 IT WAS SWADDLED LIKE A CHILD AND LONG LIKE A MAN THERE WAS A ROUND THING AT ITS SUMMIT ABOUT WHICH THE END OF THE CHAIN WAS ROLLED
5038-34576-0015 TO IT SWAYED GENTLY THE PASSIVE MASS OBEYED THE VAGUE MOTIONS OF SPACE IT WAS AN OBJECT TO INSPIRE INDESCRIBABLE DREAD HORROR
5038-34576-0016 WHICH DISPROPORTIONS EVERYTHING BLURRED ITS DIMENSIONS WHILE RETAINING ITS SHAPE IT WAS A CONDENSATION OF DARKNESS WHICH HAD A DEFINED FORM NIGHT WAS ABOVE AND WITHIN THE SPECTRE
5038-34576-0017 IT WAS A PREY OF GHASTLY EXAGGERATION TWILIGHT AND MOONRISE STARS SETTING BEHIND THE CLIFF FLOATING THINGS IN SPACE THE CLOUDS WINDS FROM ALL QUARTERS
5038-34576-0018 HAD ENDED BY PENETRATING INTO THE COMPOSITION OF THIS VISIBLE NOTHING THE SPECIES OF LOG HANGING IN THE WIND PARTOOK OF THE IMPERSONALITY DIFFUSED FAR OVER SEA AND SKY
5038-34576-0019 SUCH A THING IS BEYOND THE POWER OF LANGUAGE TO EXPRESS TO EXIST NO MORE YET TO PERSIST TO BE IN THE ABYSS YET OUT OF IT TO REAPPEAR ABOVE DEATH AS IF INDISSOLUBLE
5038-34576-0020 THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF IMPOSSIBILITY MIXED WITH SUCH REALITY THENCE COMES THE INEXPRESSIBLE THIS BEING WAS IT A BEING THIS BLACK WITNESS WAS A REMAINDER AND AN AWFUL REMAINDER
5038-34576-0021 A REMAINDER OF WHAT OF NATURE FIRST AND THEN OF SOCIETY NAUGHT AND YET TOTAL THE LAWLESS INCLEMENCY OF THE WEATHER HELD IT AT ITS WILL
5038-34576-0022 THE DEEP OBLIVION OF SOLITUDE ENVIRONED IT IT WAS GIVEN UP TO UNKNOWN CHANCES IT WAS WITHOUT DEFENCE AGAINST THE DARKNESS WHICH DID WITH IT WHAT IT WILLED IT WAS FOR EVER THE PATIENT IT SUBMITTED
5038-34576-0023 THE HURRICANE THAT GHASTLY CONFLICT OF WINDS WAS UPON IT THE SPECTRE WAS GIVEN OVER TO PILLAGE IT UNDERWENT THE HORRIBLE OUTRAGE OF ROTTING IN THE OPEN AIR IT WAS AN OUTLAW OF THE TOMB
5038-34576-0024 IT OFFENDS ALL THE CALMNESS OF SHADOW WHEN IT DOES ITS TASK OUTSIDE ITS LABORATORY THE GRAVE
5038-34576-0025 TO STRIP ONE ALREADY STRIPPED RELENTLESS ACT HIS MARROW WAS NO LONGER IN HIS BONES HIS ENTRAILS WERE NO LONGER IN HIS BODY HIS VOICE NO LONGER IN HIS THROAT A CORPSE IS A POCKET WHICH DEATH
5038-34576-0026 SOMETHING WANDERING ABOUT SOMETHING IN CHAINS CAN ONE IMAGINE A MORE MOURNFUL LINEAMENT IN THE DARKNESS REALITIES EXIST HERE BELOW WHICH SERVE AS ISSUES TO THE UNKNOWN
5038-34576-0027 ONE CANNOT HELP STOPPING A PREY TO DREAMS INTO THE REALMS OF WHICH THE MIND ENTERS IN THE INVISIBLE THERE ARE DARK PORTALS AJAR NO ONE COULD HAVE MET THIS DEAD MAN WITHOUT MEDITATING
5038-34576-0028 IN THE VASTNESS OF DISPERSION HE WAS WEARING SILENTLY AWAY HE HAD HAD BLOOD WHICH HAD BEEN DRUNK SKIN WHICH HAD BEEN EATEN FLESH WHICH HAD BEEN STOLEN NOTHING HAD PASSED HIM
5038-34576-0029 BY WITHOUT TAKING SOMEWHAT FROM HIM DECEMBER HAD BORROWED COLD OF HIM MIDNIGHT HORROR THE IRON RUST THE PLAGUE MIASMA THE FLOWERS PERFUME
5038-34576-0030 A TOLL PAID TO ALL A TOLL OF THE CORPSE TO THE STORM TO THE RAIN TO THE DEW TO THE REPTILES TO THE BIRDS ALL THE DARK HANDS OF NIGHT HAD RIFLED THE DEAD
5038-34576-0031 HE WAS INDEED AN INEXPRESSIBLY STRANGE TENANT A TENANT OF THE DARKNESS HE WAS ON A PLAIN AND ON A HILL AND HE WAS NOT HE WAS PALPABLE YET VANISHED
5038-34576-0032 BY HIS MERE PRESENCE HE INCREASED THE GLOOM OF THE TEMPEST AND THE CALM OF STARS
5038-34576-0033 WAIF OF AN UNKNOWN FATE HE COMMINGLED WITH ALL THE WILD SECRETS OF THE NIGHT THERE WAS IN HIS MYSTERY A VAGUE REVERBERATION OF ALL ENIGMAS
5038-34576-0034 ABOUT HIM LIFE SEEMED SINKING TO ITS LOWEST DEPTHS CERTAINTY AND CONFIDENCE APPEARED TO DIMINISH IN HIS ENVIRONS THE SHIVER OF THE BRUSHWOOD AND THE GRASS A DESOLATE MELANCHOLY
5038-34576-0035 AN ANXIETY IN WHICH A CONSCIENCE SEEMED TO LURK APPROPRIATED WITH TRAGIC FORCE THE WHOLE LANDSCAPE TO THAT BLACK FIGURE SUSPENDED BY THE CHAIN THE PRESENCE OF A SPECTRE IN THE HORIZON IS AN AGGRAVATION OF SOLITUDE
5038-34576-0036 WITH SOMETHING IMMENSE LEANING ON HIM WHO CAN TELL PERHAPS THAT EQUITY HALF SEEN AND SET AT DEFIANCE WHICH TRANSCENDS HUMAN JUSTICE THERE WAS IN HIS UNBURIED CONTINUANCE
5038-34576-0037 THE VENGEANCE OF MEN AND HIS OWN VENGEANCE HE WAS A TESTIMONY IN THE TWILIGHT AND THE WASTE HE WAS IN HIMSELF A DISQUIETING SUBSTANCE SINCE WE TREMBLE BEFORE THE SUBSTANCE WHICH IS THE RUINED HABITATION OF THE SOUL
5038-34576-0038 FOR DEAD MATTER TO TROUBLE US IT MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN TENANTED BY SPIRIT HE DENOUNCED THE LAW OF EARTH TO THE LAW OF HEAVEN PLACED THERE BY MAN HE THERE AWAITED GOD ABOVE HIM FLOATED
5038-34576-0039 BLENDED WITH ALL THE VAGUE DISTORTIONS OF THE CLOUD AND THE WAVE BOUNDLESS DREAMS OF SHADOW WHO COULD TELL WHAT SINISTER MYSTERIES LURKED BEHIND THIS PHANTOM
