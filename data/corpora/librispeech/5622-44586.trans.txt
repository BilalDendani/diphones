5622-44586-0000 A RICH CORRECTLY USED VOICE IS THE GREATEST PHYSICAL FACTOR OF PERSUASIVENESS AND POWER OFTEN OVER TOPPING THE EFFECTS OF REASON BUT A GOOD VOICE WELL HANDLED IS NOT ONLY AN EFFECTIVE POSSESSION FOR THE PROFESSIONAL SPEAKER
5622-44586-0001 IT IS A MARK OF PERSONAL CULTURE AS WELL
5622-44586-0002 GLADSTONE HIMSELF THE POSSESSOR OF A DEEP MUSICAL VOICE HAS SAID NINETY MEN IN EVERY HUNDRED IN THE CROWDED PROFESSIONS WILL PROBABLY NEVER RISE ABOVE MEDIOCRITY
5622-44586-0003 BECAUSE THE TRAINING OF THE VOICE IS ENTIRELY NEGLECTED AND CONSIDERED OF NO IMPORTANCE THESE ARE WORDS WORTH PONDERING
5622-44586-0004 ONE EASE SIGNOR BONCI OF THE METROPOLITAN OPERA COMPANY SAYS THAT THE SECRET OF GOOD VOICE IS RELAXATION AND THIS IS TRUE FOR RELAXATION IS THE BASIS OF EASE
5622-44586-0005 IN PRACTISING VOICE EXERCISES AND IN SPEAKING NEVER FORCE YOUR TONES EASE MUST BE YOUR WATCHWORD THE VOICE IS A DELICATE INSTRUMENT AND YOU MUST NOT HANDLE IT WITH HAMMER AND TONGS DON'T MAKE YOUR VOICE GO
5622-44586-0006 LET IT GO DON'T WORK LET THE YOKE OF SPEECH BE EASY AND ITS BURDEN LIGHT YOUR THROAT SHOULD BE FREE FROM STRAIN DURING SPEECH
5622-44586-0007 THE THROAT MUST ACT AS A SORT OF CHIMNEY OR FUNNEL FOR THE VOICE
5622-44586-0008 WILL NOT ONLY HARM ITS TONES BUT INJURE ITS HEALTH NERVOUSNESS AND MENTAL STRAIN ARE COMMON SOURCES OF MOUTH AND THROAT CONSTRICTION SO MAKE THE BATTLE FOR POISE AND SELF CONFIDENCE FOR WHICH WE PLEADED IN THE OPENING CHAPTER
5622-44586-0009 DO NOT FORCE YOUR HEAD AROUND SIMPLY RELAX YOUR NECK AND LET GRAVITY PULL IT AROUND AS YOUR BODY MOVES AGAIN LET YOUR HEAD FALL FORWARD ON YOUR BREAST RAISE YOUR HEAD LETTING YOUR JAW HANG RELAX UNTIL YOUR JAW FEELS HEAVY
5622-44586-0010 AS THOUGH IT WERE A WEIGHT HUNG TO YOUR FACE REMEMBER YOU MUST RELAX THE JAW TO OBTAIN COMMAND OF IT IT MUST BE FREE AND FLEXIBLE FOR THE MOULDING OF TONE AND TO LET THE TONE PASS OUT UNOBSTRUCTED
5622-44586-0011 THE LIPS ALSO MUST BE MADE FLEXIBLE TO AID IN THE MOULDING OF CLEAR AND BEAUTIFUL TONES FOR FLEXIBILITY OF LIPS REPEAT THE SYLLABLES MO ME IN SAYING MO BRING THE LIPS UP TO RESEMBLE THE SHAPE OF THE LETTER O
5622-44586-0012 IN REPEATING ME DRAW THEM BACK AS YOU DO IN A GRIN REPEAT THIS EXERCISE RAPIDLY GIVING THE LIPS AS MUCH EXERCISE AS POSSIBLE TRY THE FOLLOWING EXERCISE IN THE SAME MANNER
5622-44586-0013 AFTER THIS EXERCISE HAS BEEN MASTERED THE FOLLOWING WILL ALSO BE FOUND EXCELLENT FOR FLEXIBILITY OF LIPS MEMORIZE THESE SOUNDS INDICATED NOT THE EXPRESSIONS SO THAT YOU CAN REPEAT THEM RAPIDLY
5622-44586-0014 A AS IN MAY E AS IN MET U AS IN USE A
5622-44586-0015 YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT ALL THE ACTIVITY THEN CENTERS AROUND THE DIAPHRAGM THIS IS THE NATURAL AND CORRECT METHOD OF BREATHING BY CONSTANT WATCHFULNESS MAKE THIS YOUR HABITUAL MANNER
5622-44586-0016 IF THE MUSCLES OF THE THROAT ARE CONSTRICTED THE TONE PASSAGE PARTIALLY CLOSED AND THE MOUTH KEPT HALF SHUT HOW CAN YOU EXPECT THE TONE TO COME OUT BRIGHT AND CLEAR OR EVEN TO COME OUT AT ALL SOUND IS A SERIES OF WAVES AND IF YOU MAKE A PRISON OF YOUR MOUTH
5622-44586-0017 HOLDING THE JAWS AND LIPS RIGIDLY IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE TONE TO SQUEEZE THROUGH
5622-44586-0018 OPEN YOUR MOUTH WIDE RELAX ALL THE ORGANS OF SPEECH AND LET THE TONE FLOW OUT EASILY START TO YAWN BUT INSTEAD OF YAWNING SPEAK WHILE YOUR THROAT IS OPEN MAKE THIS OPEN FEELING HABITUAL WHEN SPEAKING
5622-44586-0019 WE SAY MAKE BECAUSE IT IS A MATTER OF RESOLUTION AND OF PRACTISE IF YOUR VOCAL ORGANS ARE HEALTHY YOUR TONE PASSAGES MAY BE PARTLY CLOSED BY ENLARGED TONSILS ADENOIDS OR ENLARGED TURBINATE BONES OF THE NOSE
5622-44586-0020 IF SO A SKILLED PHYSICIAN SHOULD BE CONSULTED THE NOSE IS AN IMPORTANT TONE PASSAGE AND SHOULD BE KEPT OPEN AND FREE FOR PERFECT TONES WHAT WE CALL TALKING THROUGH THE NOSE IS NOT TALKING THROUGH THE NOSE
5622-44586-0021 AS YOU CAN EASILY DEMONSTRATE BY HOLDING YOUR NOSE AS YOU TALK IF YOU ARE BOTHERED WITH NASAL TONES CAUSED BY GROWTHS OR SWELLINGS IN THE NASAL PASSAGES A SLIGHT PAINLESS OPERATION WILL REMOVE THE OBSTRUCTION THIS IS QUITE IMPORTANT
5622-44586-0022 SOMBRE AND UNATTRACTIVE THE TONE MUST BE PITCHED FORWARD BUT DO NOT FORCE IT FORWARD YOU WILL RECALL THAT OUR FIRST PRINCIPLE WAS EASE THINK THE TONE FORWARD AND OUT BELIEVE IT IS GOING FORWARD AND ALLOW IT TO FLOW EASILY
5622-44586-0023 YOU CAN TELL WHETHER YOU ARE PLACING YOUR TONE FORWARD OR NOT BY INHALING A DEEP BREATH AND SINGING AH WITH THE MOUTH WIDE OPEN TRYING TO FEEL THE LITTLE DELICATE SOUND WAVES STRIKE THE BONY ARCH OF THE MOUTH JUST ABOVE THE FRONT TEETH
5622-44586-0024 THE SENSATION IS SO SLIGHT THAT YOU WILL PROBABLY NOT BE ABLE TO DETECT IT AT ONCE BUT PERSEVERE IN YOUR PRACTISE ALWAYS THINKING THE TONE FORWARD AND YOU WILL BE REWARDED BY FEELING YOUR VOICE STRIKE THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH
5622-44586-0025 A CORRECT FORWARD PLACING OF THE TONE WILL DO AWAY WITH THE DARK THROATY TONES THAT ARE SO UNPLEASANT INEFFICIENT AND HARMFUL TO THE THROAT CLOSE THE LIPS
5622-44586-0026 THINK THE TONE FORWARD DO YOU FEEL IT STRIKE THE LIPS HOLD THE PALM OF YOUR HAND IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE AND SAY VIGOROUSLY CRASH DASH WHIRL BUZZ CAN YOU FEEL THE FORWARD TONES STRIKE AGAINST YOUR HAND PRACTISE UNTIL YOU CAN
5622-44586-0027 REMEMBER THE ONLY WAY TO GET YOUR VOICE FORWARD IS TO PUT IT FORWARD HOW TO DEVELOP THE CARRYING POWER OF THE VOICE IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SPEAK LOUDLY IN ORDER TO BE HEARD AT A DISTANCE IT IS NECESSARY ONLY TO SPEAK CORRECTLY
5622-44586-0028 REMEMBER TO APPLY THE PRINCIPLES OF EASE OPENNESS AND FORWARDNESS THEY ARE THE PRIME FACTORS IN ENABLING YOUR VOICE TO BE HEARD AT A DISTANCE DO NOT GAZE AT THE FLOOR AS YOU TALK THIS HABIT NOT ONLY GIVES THE SPEAKER AN AMATEURISH APPEARANCE
5622-44586-0029 BUT IF THE HEAD IS HUNG FORWARD THE VOICE WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE GROUND INSTEAD OF FLOATING OUT OVER THE AUDIENCE VOICE IS A SERIES OF AIR VIBRATIONS TO STRENGTHEN IT TWO THINGS ARE NECESSARY MORE AIR OR BREATH AND MORE VIBRATION
5622-44586-0030 USUALLY ILL HEALTH MEANS A WEAK VOICE WHILE ABUNDANT PHYSICAL VITALITY IS SHOWN THROUGH A STRONG VIBRANT VOICE THEREFORE ANYTHING THAT IMPROVES THE GENERAL VITALITY IS AN EXCELLENT VOICE STRENGTHENER PROVIDED YOU USE THE VOICE PROPERLY
5622-44586-0031 AND DEVELOPED LUNG POWER A HARD FOUGHT BASKETBALL OR TENNIS GAME IS AN EFFICIENT WAY OF PRACTISING DEEP BREATHING WHEN THESE METHODS ARE NOT CONVENIENT WE RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING PLACE YOUR HANDS AT YOUR SIDES ON THE WAIST LINE
5622-44586-0032 BY TRYING TO ENCOMPASS YOUR WAIST WITH YOUR FINGERS AND THUMBS FORCE ALL THE AIR OUT OF THE LUNGS TAKE A DEEP BREATH REMEMBER ALL THE ACTIVITY IS TO BE CENTERED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BODY
5622-44586-0033 REPEAT THE EXERCISE PLACING YOUR HANDS ON THE SMALL OF THE BACK AND FORCING THEM OUT AS YOU INHALE MANY METHODS FOR DEEP BREATHING HAVE BEEN GIVEN BY VARIOUS AUTHORITIES GET THE AIR INTO YOUR LUNGS THAT IS THE IMPORTANT THING
5622-44586-0034 AFTER A LITTLE PRACTISE THEY WILL VIBRATE GIVING A TICKLING SENSATION REPEAT THIS EXERCISE THROWING THE HUMMING SOUND INTO THE NOSE HOLD THE UPPER PART OF THE NOSE BETWEEN THE THUMB AND FOREFINGER CAN YOU FEEL THE NOSE VIBRATE
5622-44586-0035 PLACING THE PALM OF YOUR HAND ON TOP OF YOUR HEAD REPEAT THIS HUMMING EXERCISE THINK THE VOICE THERE AS YOU HUM IN HEAD TONES CAN YOU FEEL THE VIBRATION THERE NOW PLACE THE PALM OF YOUR HAND ON THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD REPEATING THE FOREGOING PROCESS
5622-44586-0036 THEN TRY IT ON THE CHEST ALWAYS REMEMBER TO THINK YOUR TONE WHERE YOU DESIRE TO FEEL THE VIBRATIONS THE MERE ACT OF THINKING ABOUT ANY PORTION OF YOUR BODY WILL TEND TO MAKE IT VIBRATE
5622-44586-0037 ENDEAVORING TO FEEL ALL PORTIONS OF YOUR BODY VIBRATE AT THE SAME TIME WHEN YOU HAVE ATTAINED THIS YOU WILL FIND THAT IT IS A PLEASANT SENSATION WHAT HO MY JOVIAL MATES COME ON WE WILL FROLIC IT LIKE FAIRIES FRISKING IN THE MERRY MOONSHINE
5622-44586-0038 PURITY OF VOICE THIS QUALITY IS SOMETIMES DESTROYED BY WASTING THE BREATH CAREFULLY CONTROL THE BREATH USING ONLY AS MUCH AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE PRODUCTION OF TONE UTILIZE ALL THAT YOU GIVE OUT
5622-44586-0039 FAILURE TO DO THIS RESULTS IN A BREATHY TONE TAKE IN BREATH LIKE A PRODIGAL IN SPEAKING GIVE IT OUT LIKE A MISER VOICE SUGGESTIONS NEVER ATTEMPT TO FORCE YOUR VOICE WHEN HOARSE DO NOT DRINK COLD WATER WHEN SPEAKING
5622-44586-0040 THE SUDDEN SHOCK TO THE HEATED ORGANS OF SPEECH WILL INJURE THE VOICE AVOID PITCHING YOUR VOICE TOO HIGH IT WILL MAKE IT RASPY THIS IS A COMMON FAULT
5622-44586-0041 A WIDE RANGE WILL GIVE YOU FACILITY IN MAKING NUMEROUS CHANGES OF PITCH DO NOT FORM THE HABIT OF LISTENING TO YOUR VOICE WHEN SPEAKING YOU WILL NEED YOUR BRAIN TO THINK OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING RESERVE YOUR OBSERVATION FOR PRIVATE PRACTISE
5622-44586-0042 GIVE SOME EXERCISES FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THESE CONDITIONS FOUR WHY IS RANGE OF VOICE DESIRABLE FIVE TELL HOW RANGE OF VOICE MAY BE CULTIVATED SIX
5622-44586-0043 HOW MUCH DAILY PRACTISE DO YOU CONSIDER NECESSARY FOR THE PROPER DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR VOICE SEVEN HOW CAN RESONANCE AND CARRYING POWER BE DEVELOPED EIGHT WHAT ARE YOUR VOICE FAULTS
