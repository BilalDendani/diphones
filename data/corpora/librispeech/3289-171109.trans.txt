3289-171109-0000 ALEXANDRA REIGNS NINE YEARS DURING WHICH TIME THE PHARISEES WERE THE REAL RULERS OF THE NATION ONE
3289-171109-0001 AND HAD THEREBY GOT THE GOOD WILL OF THE PEOPLE NOR WAS HE MISTAKEN AS TO HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS WOMAN KEPT THE DOMINION BY THE OPINION THAT THE PEOPLE HAD OF HER PIETY FOR SHE CHIEFLY STUDIED THE ANCIENT CUSTOMS OF HER COUNTRY
3289-171109-0002 AND CAST THOSE MEN OUT OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT OFFENDED AGAINST THEIR HOLY LAWS AND AS SHE HAD TWO SONS BY ALEXANDER SHE MADE HYRCANUS THE ELDER HIGH PRIEST ON ACCOUNT OF HIS AGE AS ALSO BESIDES THAT ON ACCOUNT OF HIS INACTIVE TEMPER
3289-171109-0003 NO WAY DISPOSING HIM TO DISTURB THE PUBLIC BUT SHE RETAINED THE YOUNGER ARISTOBULUS WITH HER AS A PRIVATE PERSON BY REASON OF THE WARMTH OF HIS TEMPER TWO AND NOW THE PHARISEES JOINED THEMSELVES TO HER TO ASSIST HER IN THE GOVERNMENT
3289-171109-0004 AND SEEM TO INTERPRET THE LAWS MORE ACCURATELY LOW ALEXANDRA HEARKENED TO THEM TO AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE AS BEING HERSELF A WOMAN OF GREAT PIETY TOWARDS GOD BUT THESE PHARISEES ARTFULLY INSINUATED THEMSELVES INTO HER FAVOR
3289-171109-0005 BY LITTLE AND LITTLE AND BECAME THEMSELVES THE REAL ADMINISTRATORS OF THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS THEY BANISHED AND REDUCED WHOM THEY PLEASED THEY BOUND AND LOOSED MEN AT THEIR PLEASURE
3289-171109-0006 THEY HAD THE ENJOYMENT OF THE ROYAL AUTHORITY WHILST THE EXPENSES AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF IT BELONGED TO ALEXANDRA SHE WAS A SAGACIOUS WOMAN IN THE MANAGEMENT OF GREAT AFFAIRS AND INTENT ALWAYS UPON GATHERING SOLDIERS TOGETHER SO THAT SHE INCREASED THE ARMY THE ONE HALF
3289-171109-0007 AND PROCURED A GREAT BODY OF FOREIGN TROOPS TILL HER OWN NATION BECAME NOT ONLY VERY POWERFUL AT HOME BUT TERRIBLE ALSO TO FOREIGN POTENTATES WHILE SHE GOVERNED OTHER PEOPLE AND THE PHARISEES GOVERNED HER THREE ACCORDINGLY
3289-171109-0008 A PERSON OF FIGURE AND ONE THAT HAD BEEN A FRIEND TO ALEXANDER AND ACCUSED HIM AS HAVING ASSISTED THE KING WITH HIS ADVICE FOR CRUCIFYING THE EIGHT HUNDRED MEN BEFORE MENTIONED
3289-171109-0009 NOW SHE WAS SO SUPERSTITIOUS AS TO COMPLY WITH THEIR DESIRES AND ACCORDINGLY THEY SLEW WHOM THEY PLEASED THEMSELVES BUT THE PRINCIPAL OF THOSE THAT WERE IN DANGER FLED TO ARISTOBULUS WHO PERSUADED HIS MOTHER TO SPARE THE MEN ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR DIGNITY
3289-171109-0010 BUT TO EXPEL THEM OUT OF THE CITY UNLESS SHE TOOK THEM TO BE INNOCENT SO THEY WERE SUFFERED TO GO UNPUNISHED AND WERE DISPERSED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BUT WHEN ALEXANDRA SENT OUT HER ARMY TO DAMASCUS
3289-171109-0011 AND BESIEGED CLEOPATRA FIVE
3289-171109-0012 FOUR IN THE MEAN TIME ALEXANDRA FELL SICK AND ARISTOBULUS HER YOUNGER SON TOOK HOLD OF THIS OPPORTUNITY WITH HIS DOMESTICS OF WHICH HE HAD A GREAT MANY WHO WERE ALL OF THEM HIS FRIENDS ON ACCOUNT OF THE WARMTH OF THEIR YOUTH
3289-171109-0013 AND GOT POSSESSION OF ALL THE FORTRESSES HE ALSO USED THE SUMS OF MONEY HE FOUND IN THEM TO GET TOGETHER A NUMBER OF MERCENARY SOLDIERS AND MADE HIMSELF KING AND BESIDES THIS UPON HYRCANUS'S COMPLAINT TO HIS MOTHER SHE COMPASSIONATED HIS CASE
3289-171109-0014 JUST AS THE OTHER CITIES SEBASTE AND AGRIPPIAS HAD THEIR NAMES CHANGED AND THESE GIVEN THEM FROM SEBASTUS AND AGRIPPA BUT ALEXANDRA DIED BEFORE SHE COULD PUNISH ARISTOBULUS FOR HIS DISINHERITING HIS BROTHER AFTER SHE HAD REIGNED NINE YEARS
3289-171109-0015 CHAPTER SIX WHEN HYRCANUS WHO WAS ALEXANDER'S HEIR RECEDED FROM HIS CLAIM TO THE CROWN ARISTOBULUS IS MADE KING AND AFTERWARD THE SAME HYRCANUS BY THE MEANS OF ANTIPATER IS BROUGHT BACK BY ABETAS
3289-171109-0016 AT LAST POMPEY IS MADE THE ARBITRATOR OF THE DISPUTE BETWEEN THE BROTHERS ONE NOW HYRCANUS WAS HEIR TO THE KINGDOM AND TO HIM DID HIS MOTHER COMMIT IT BEFORE SHE DIED BUT ARISTOBULUS WAS SUPERIOR TO HIM IN POWER AND MAGNANIMITY
3289-171109-0017 AND HYRCANUS RETIRED TO THE HOUSE OF ARISTOBULUS TWO NOW THOSE OTHER PEOPLE WHICH WERE AT VARIANCE WITH ARISTOBULUS WERE AFRAID UPON HIS UNEXPECTED OBTAINING THE GOVERNMENT AND ESPECIALLY THIS CONCERNED ANTIPATER
3289-171109-0018 ON ACCOUNT OF HIS ANCESTORS AND RICHES AND OTHER AUTHORITY TO HIM BELONGING HE ALSO PERSUADED HYRCANUS TO FLY TO ARETAS THE KING OF ARABIA AND TO LAY CLAIM TO THE KINGDOM AS ALSO HE PERSUADED ARETAS TO RECEIVE HYRCANUS AND TO BRING HIM BACK TO HIS KINGDOM
3289-171109-0019 HE ALSO CAST GREAT REPROACHES UPON ARISTOBULUS AS TO HIS MORALS AND GAVE GREAT COMMENDATIONS TO HYRCANUS AND EXHORTED ARETAS TO RECEIVE HIM
3289-171109-0020 TO AFFORD HIS ASSISTANCE TO SUCH AS ARE INJURED ALLEGING THAT HYRCANUS WAS TREATED UNJUSTLY BY BEING DEPRIVED OF THAT DOMINION WHICH BELONGED TO HIM BY THE PREROGATIVE OF HIS BIRTH AND WHEN HE HAD PREDISPOSED THEM BOTH TO DO WHAT HE WOULD HAVE THEM HE TOOK HYRCANUS BY NIGHT
3289-171109-0021 AND RAN AWAY FROM THE CITY AND CONTINUING HIS FLIGHT WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS HE ESCAPED TO THE PLACE CALLED PETRA WHICH IS THE ROYAL SEAT OF THE KING OF ARABIA WHERE HE PUT HYRCANUS INTO ARETAS'S HAND AND BY DISCOURSING MUCH WITH HIM
3289-171109-0022 AND GAINING UPON HIM WITH MANY PRESENTS HE PREVAILED WITH HIM TO GIVE HIM AN ARMY THAT MIGHT RESTORE HIM TO HIS KINGDOM THIS ARMY CONSISTED OF FIFTY THOUSAND FOOTMEN AND HORSEMEN AGAINST WHICH ARISTOBULUS WAS NOT ABLE TO MAKE RESISTANCE
3289-171109-0023 BUT WAS DESERTED IN HIS FIRST ONSET AND WAS DRIVEN TO JERUSALEM HE ALSO HAD BEEN TAKEN AT FIRST BY FORCE IF SCAURUS THE ROMAN GENERAL HAD NOT COME AND SEASONABLY INTERPOSED HIMSELF AND RAISED THE SIEGE
3289-171109-0024 THIS SCAURUS WAS SENT INTO SYRIA FROM ARMENIA BY POMPEY THE GREAT WHEN HE FOUGHT AGAINST TIGRANES SO SCAURUS CAME TO DAMASCUS WHICH HAD BEEN LATELY TAKEN BY METELLUS AND LOLLIUS AND CAUSED THEM TO LEAVE THE PLACE
3289-171109-0025 AND UPON HIS HEARING HOW THE AFFAIRS OF JUDEA STOOD HE MADE HASTE THITHER AS TO A CERTAIN BOOTY THREE AS SOON THEREFORE AS HE WAS COME INTO THE COUNTRY THERE CAME AMBASSADORS FROM BOTH THE BROTHERS EACH OF THEM DESIRING HIS ASSISTANCE
3289-171109-0026 BUT ARISTOBULUS'S THREE HUNDRED TALENTS HAD MORE WEIGHT WITH HIM THAN THE JUSTICE OF THE CAUSE WHICH SUM WHEN SCAURUS HAD RECEIVED HE SENT A HERALD TO HYRCANUS AND THE ARABIANS AND THREATENED THEM WITH THE RESENTMENT OF THE ROMANS AND OF POMPEY UNLESS THEY WOULD RAISE THE SIEGE
3289-171109-0027 AND SLEW ABOUT SIX THOUSAND OF THEM AND TOGETHER WITH THEM ANTIPATER'S BROTHER PHALION FOUR WHEN HYRCANUS AND ANTIPATER WERE THUS DEPRIVED OF THEIR HOPES FROM THE ARABIANS THEY TRANSFERRED THE SAME TO THEIR ADVERSARIES
3289-171109-0028 AND BECAUSE POMPEY HAD PASSED THROUGH SYRIA AND WAS COME TO DAMASCUS THEY FLED TO HIM FOR ASSISTANCE AND WITHOUT ANY BRIBES THEY MADE THE SAME EQUITABLE PLEAS THAT THEY HAD USED TO ARETAS AND BESOUGHT HIM TO HATE THE VIOLENT BEHAVIOR OF ARISTOBULUS
3289-171109-0029 AND TO BESTOW THE KINGDOM ON HIM TO WHOM IT JUSTLY BELONGED BOTH ON ACCOUNT OF HIS GOOD CHARACTER AND ON ACCOUNT OF HIS SUPERIORITY IN AGE HOWEVER NEITHER WAS ARISTOBULUS WANTING TO HIMSELF IN THIS CASE AS RELYING ON THE BRIBES THAT SCAURUS HAD RECEIVED
3289-171109-0030 HE WAS ALSO THERE HIMSELF AND ADORNED HIMSELF AFTER A MANNER THE MOST AGREEABLE TO ROYALTY THAT HE WAS ABLE BUT HE SOON THOUGHT IT BENEATH HIM TO COME IN SUCH A SERVILE MANNER AND COULD NOT ENDURE TO SERVE HIS OWN ENDS IN A WAY SO MUCH MORE ABJECT THAN HE WAS USED TO
3289-171109-0031 BUT MANY OF HIS SYRIAN AUXILIARIES AND MARCHED AGAINST ARISTOBULUS BUT WHEN HE HAD PASSED BY PELLA AND SCYTHOPOLIS AND WAS COME TO COREA WHERE YOU ENTER INTO THE COUNTRY OF JUDEA WHEN YOU GO UP TO IT THROUGH THE MEDITERRANEAN PARTS
3289-171109-0032 HE HEARD THAT ARISTOBULUS WAS FLED TO ALEXANDRIUM WHICH IS A STRONG HOLD FORTIFIED WITH THE UTMOST MAGNIFICENCE AND SITUATED UPON A HIGH MOUNTAIN AND HE SENT TO HIM AND COMMANDED HIM TO COME DOWN NOW HIS INCLINATION WAS TO TRY HIS FORTUNE IN A BATTLE
3289-171109-0033 SINCE HE WAS CALLED IN SUCH AN IMPERIOUS MANNER RATHER THAN TO COMPLY WITH THAT CALL HOWEVER HE SAW THE MULTITUDE WERE IN GREAT FEAR
3289-171109-0034 AND WHEN HE WENT UP TO THE CITADEL IT WAS THAT HE MIGHT NOT APPEAR TO DEBASE HIMSELF TOO LOW HOWEVER POMPEY COMMANDED HIM TO GIVE UP HIS FORTIFIED PLACES AND FORCED HIM TO WRITE TO EVERY ONE OF THEIR GOVERNORS TO YIELD THEM UP
3289-171109-0035 AND RETIRED TO JERUSALEM AND PREPARED TO FIGHT WITH POMPEY SIX
