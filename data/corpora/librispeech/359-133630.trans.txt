359-133630-0000 ALLAN QUATERMAIN BY H RIDER HAGGARD I INSCRIBE THIS BOOK OF ADVENTURE TO MY SON ARTHUR JOHN RIDER HAGGARD IN THE HOPE THAT IN DAYS TO COME HE
359-133630-0001 AND MANY OTHER BOYS WHOM I SHALL NEVER KNOW MAY IN THE ACTS AND THOUGHTS OF ALLAN QUATERMAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS
359-133630-0002 I HAVE JUST BURIED MY BOY MY POOR HANDSOME BOY OF WHOM I WAS SO PROUD AND MY HEART IS BROKEN
359-133630-0003 IT IS VERY HARD HAVING ONLY ONE SON TO LOSE HIM THUS BUT GOD'S WILL BE DONE WHO AM I THAT I SHOULD COMPLAIN THE GREAT WHEEL OF FATE
359-133630-0004 WE DO NOT PROSTRATE OURSELVES BEFORE IT LIKE THE POOR INDIANS WE FLY HITHER AND THITHER WE CRY FOR MERCY BUT IT IS OF NO USE THE BLACK FATE THUNDERS ON
359-133630-0005 AND IN ITS SEASON REDUCES US TO POWDER POOR HARRY TO GO SO SOON JUST WHEN HIS LIFE WAS OPENING TO HIM HE WAS DOING SO WELL AT THE HOSPITAL
359-133630-0006 HE HAD PASSED HIS LAST EXAMINATION WITH HONOURS AND I WAS PROUD OF THEM MUCH PROUDER THAN HE WAS I THINK AND THEN HE MUST NEEDS GO TO THAT SMALLPOX HOSPITAL HE WROTE TO ME THAT HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF SMALLPOX
359-133630-0007 AND WANTED TO GAIN THE EXPERIENCE AND NOW THE DISEASE HAS KILLED HIM AND I OLD AND GREY AND WITHERED AM LEFT TO MOURN OVER HIM WITHOUT A CHICK OR CHILD TO COMFORT ME
359-133630-0008 I MIGHT HAVE SAVED HIM TOO I HAVE MONEY ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF US AND MUCH MORE THAN ENOUGH KING SOLOMON'S MINES PROVIDED ME WITH THAT BUT I SAID NO LET THE BOY EARN HIS LIVING LET HIM LABOUR
359-133630-0009 THAT HE MAY ENJOY REST BUT THE REST HAS COME TO HIM BEFORE THE LABOUR OH MY BOY MY BOY I AM LIKE THE MAN IN THE BIBLE WHO LAID UP MUCH GOODS
359-133630-0010 AND BUILDED BARNS GOODS FOR MY BOY AND BARNS FOR HIM TO STORE THEM IN AND NOW HIS SOUL HAS BEEN REQUIRED OF HIM AND I AM LEFT DESOLATE
359-133630-0011 I WOULD THAT IT HAD BEEN MY SOUL AND NOT MY BOY'S WE BURIED HIM THIS AFTERNOON UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE GREY AND ANCIENT TOWER OF THE CHURCH OF THIS VILLAGE WHERE MY HOUSE IS
359-133630-0012 IT WAS A DREARY DECEMBER AFTERNOON AND THE SKY WAS HEAVY WITH SNOW BUT NOT MUCH WAS FALLING THE COFFIN WAS PUT DOWN BY THE GRAVE AND A FEW BIG FLAKES LIT UPON IT
359-133630-0013 THEY LOOKED VERY WHITE UPON THE BLACK CLOTH THERE WAS A LITTLE HITCH ABOUT GETTING THE COFFIN DOWN INTO THE GRAVE THE NECESSARY ROPES HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN SO WE DREW BACK FROM IT
359-133630-0014 AND WAITED IN SILENCE WATCHING THE BIG FLAKES FALL GENTLY ONE BY ONE LIKE HEAVENLY BENEDICTIONS AND MELT IN TEARS ON HARRY'S PALL
359-133630-0015 BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL A ROBIN REDBREAST CAME AS BOLD AS COULD BE AND LIT UPON THE COFFIN AND BEGAN TO SING AND THEN I AM AFRAID THAT I BROKE DOWN
359-133630-0016 AND SO DID SIR HENRY CURTIS STRONG MAN THOUGH HE IS AND AS FOR CAPTAIN GOOD I SAW HIM TURN AWAY TOO EVEN IN MY OWN DISTRESS I COULD NOT HELP NOTICING IT
359-133630-0017 THE ABOVE SIGNED ALLAN QUATERMAIN IS AN EXTRACT FROM MY DIARY WRITTEN TWO YEARS AND MORE AGO I COPY IT DOWN HERE BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME
359-133630-0018 THAT IT IS THE FITTEST BEGINNING TO THE HISTORY THAT I AM ABOUT TO WRITE IF IT PLEASE GOD TO SPARE ME TO FINISH IT IF NOT WELL IT DOES NOT MATTER THAT EXTRACT WAS PENNED SEVEN THOUSAND MILES OR SO
359-133630-0019 I CANNOT HELP FEELING THAT I AM NOT FAR OFF HARRY WHEN I WAS IN ENGLAND I USED TO LIVE IN A VERY FINE HOUSE AT LEAST I CALL IT A FINE HOUSE SPEAKING COMPARATIVELY
359-133630-0020 BUT I COULD NOT EAT MUCH AND SOON I TOOK TO WALKING OR RATHER LIMPING BEING PERMANENTLY LAME FROM THE BITE OF A LION UP AND DOWN
359-133630-0021 UP AND DOWN THE OAK PANELLED VESTIBULE FOR THERE IS A VESTIBULE IN MY HOUSE IN ENGLAND ON ALL THE FOUR WALLS OF THIS VESTIBULE WERE PLACED PAIRS OF HORNS ABOUT A HUNDRED PAIRS ALTOGETHER
359-133630-0022 ALL OF WHICH I HAD SHOT MYSELF THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL SPECIMENS AS I NEVER KEEP ANY HORNS WHICH ARE NOT IN EVERY WAY PERFECT UNLESS IT MAY BE NOW AND AGAIN ON ACCOUNT OF THE ASSOCIATIONS CONNECTED WITH THEM
359-133630-0023 SUCH AS USED TO BE OWNED BY THE DUTCHMEN A ROER THEY CALL IT THAT GUN THE BOER I BOUGHT IT FROM MANY YEARS AGO TOLD ME HAD BEEN USED BY HIS FATHER AT THE BATTLE OF THE BLOOD RIVER
359-133630-0024 JUST AFTER DINGAAN SWEPT INTO NATAL AND SLAUGHTERED SIX HUNDRED MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN SO THAT THE BOERS NAMED THE PLACE WHERE THEY DIED WEENEN OR THE PLACE OF WEEPING
359-133630-0025 AND SO IT IS CALLED TO THIS DAY AND ALWAYS WILL BE CALLED AND MANY AN ELEPHANT HAVE I SHOT WITH THAT OLD GUN
359-133630-0026 AND KICKED LIKE THE VERY DEUCE WELL UP AND DOWN I WALKED STARING AT THE GUNS AND THE HORNS WHICH THE GUNS HAD BROUGHT LOW AND AS I DID SO THERE ROSE UP IN ME A GREAT CRAVING
359-133630-0027 I WOULD GO AWAY FROM THIS PLACE WHERE I LIVED IDLY AND AT EASE BACK AGAIN TO THE WILD LAND WHERE I HAD SPENT MY LIFE WHERE I MET MY DEAR WIFE AND POOR HARRY WAS BORN
359-133630-0028 AND SO MANY THINGS GOOD BAD AND INDIFFERENT HAD HAPPENED TO ME THE THIRST FOR THE WILDERNESS WAS ON ME I COULD TOLERATE THIS PLACE NO MORE I WOULD GO AND DIE AS I HAD LIVED
359-133630-0029 AMONG THE WILD GAME AND THE SAVAGES YES AS I WALKED I BEGAN TO LONG TO SEE THE MOONLIGHT GLEAMING SILVERY WHITE OVER THE WIDE VELDT AND MYSTERIOUS SEA OF BUSH
359-133630-0030 AND WATCH THE LINES OF GAME TRAVELLING DOWN THE RIDGES TO THE WATER THE RULING PASSION IS STRONG IN DEATH THEY SAY AND MY HEART WAS DEAD THAT NIGHT BUT INDEPENDENTLY OF MY TROUBLE
359-133630-0031 NO MAN WHO HAS FOR FORTY YEARS LIVED THE LIFE I HAVE CAN WITH IMPUNITY GO COOP HIMSELF IN THIS PRIM ENGLISH COUNTRY WITH ITS TRIM HEDGEROWS AND CULTIVATED FIELDS
359-133630-0032 ITS STIFF FORMAL MANNERS AND ITS WELL DRESSED CROWDS HE BEGINS TO LONG AH HOW HE LONGS FOR THE KEEN BREATH OF THE DESERT AIR
359-133630-0033 HE DREAMS OF THE SIGHT OF ZULU IMPIS BREAKING ON THEIR FOES LIKE SURF UPON THE ROCKS AND HIS HEART RISES UP IN REBELLION AGAINST THE STRICT LIMITS OF THE CIVILIZED LIFE AH THIS CIVILIZATION
359-133630-0034 WHAT DOES IT ALL COME TO FOR FORTY YEARS AND MORE I LIVED AMONG SAVAGES AND STUDIED THEM AND THEIR WAYS AND NOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS I HAVE LIVED HERE IN ENGLAND AND HAVE IN MY OWN STUPID MANNER
359-133630-0035 DONE MY BEST TO LEARN THE WAYS OF THE CHILDREN OF LIGHT AND WHAT HAVE I FOUND A GREAT GULF FIXED NO ONLY A VERY LITTLE ONE THAT A PLAIN MAN'S THOUGHT MAY SPRING ACROSS
359-133630-0036 IS TO A LARGE EXTENT FREE FROM THE GREED OF MONEY WHICH EATS LIKE A CANCER INTO THE HEART OF THE WHITE MAN IT IS A DEPRESSING CONCLUSION BUT IN ALL ESSENTIALS THE SAVAGE
359-133630-0037 AND THE CHILD OF CIVILIZATION ARE IDENTICAL I DARE SAY THAT THE HIGHLY CIVILIZED LADY READING THIS WILL SMILE AT AN OLD FOOL OF A HUNTER'S SIMPLICITY WHEN SHE THINKS OF HER BLACK BEAD BEDECKED SISTER
359-133630-0038 THEY HAVE A STRONG FAMILY RESEMBLANCE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU WEAR THAT VERY LOW DRESS TO THE SAVAGE WOMAN'S BEADS YOUR HABIT OF TURNING ROUND AND ROUND TO THE SOUND OF HORNS AND TOM TOMS
359-133630-0039 YOUR FONDNESS FOR PIGMENTS AND POWDERS THE WAY IN WHICH YOU LOVE TO SUBJUGATE YOURSELF TO THE RICH WARRIOR WHO HAS CAPTURED YOU IN MARRIAGE AND THE QUICKNESS WITH WHICH YOUR TASTE IN FEATHERED HEAD DRESSES VARIES
359-133630-0040 ALL THESE THINGS SUGGEST TOUCHES OF KINSHIP AND YOU REMEMBER THAT IN THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF YOUR NATURE YOU ARE QUITE IDENTICAL AS FOR YOU SIR WHO ALSO LAUGH
359-133630-0041 LET SOME MAN COME AND STRIKE YOU IN THE FACE WHILST YOU ARE ENJOYING THAT MARVELLOUS LOOKING DISH AND WE SHALL SOON SEE HOW MUCH OF THE SAVAGE THERE IS IN YOU
359-133630-0042 THERE I MIGHT GO ON FOR EVER BUT WHAT IS THE GOOD CIVILIZATION IS ONLY SAVAGERY SILVER GILT A VAINGLORY IS IT
359-133630-0043 AND LIKE A NORTHERN LIGHT COMES BUT TO FADE AND LEAVE THE SKY MORE DARK OUT OF THE SOIL OF BARBARISM IT HAS GROWN LIKE A TREE AND AS I BELIEVE
359-133630-0044 INTO THE SOIL LIKE A TREE IT WILL ONCE MORE SOONER OR LATER FALL AGAIN AS THE EGYPTIAN CIVILIZATION FELL AS THE HELLENIC CIVILIZATION FELL AND AS THE ROMAN CIVILIZATION AND MANY OTHERS
359-133630-0045 OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS NOW LOST COUNT FELL ALSO DO NOT LET ME HOWEVER BE UNDERSTOOD AS DECRYING OUR MODERN INSTITUTIONS REPRESENTING AS THEY DO THE GATHERED EXPERIENCE OF HUMANITY
359-133630-0046 APPLIED FOR THE GOOD OF ALL OF COURSE THEY HAVE GREAT ADVANTAGES HOSPITALS FOR INSTANCE BUT THEN REMEMBER WE BREED THE SICKLY PEOPLE WHO FILL THEM IN A SAVAGE LAND THEY DO NOT EXIST
359-133630-0047 BESIDES THE QUESTION WILL ARISE HOW MANY OF THESE BLESSINGS ARE DUE TO CHRISTIANITY AS DISTINCT FROM CIVILIZATION AND SO THE BALANCE SWAYS AND THE STORY RUNS
359-133630-0048 HERE A GAIN THERE A LOSS AND NATURE'S GREAT AVERAGE STRUCK ACROSS THE TWO WHEREOF THE SUM TOTAL FORMS ONE OF THE FACTORS IN THAT MIGHTY EQUATION
359-133630-0049 SO THAT WE MAY NOT BE CARRIED AWAY BY THE PRIDE OF KNOWLEDGE MAN'S CLEVERNESS IS ALMOST INDEFINITE AND STRETCHES LIKE AN ELASTIC BAND
359-133630-0050 YOU CAN GO ROUND AND ROUND IT YOU CAN POLISH IT HIGHLY
359-133630-0051 WHEREBY YOU WILL MAKE IT BULGE OUT THE OTHER BUT YOU WILL NEVER WHILE THE WORLD ENDURES AND MAN IS MAN INCREASE ITS TOTAL CIRCUMFERENCE IT IS THE ONE FIXED UNCHANGEABLE THING
359-133630-0052 FIXED AS THE STARS MORE ENDURING THAN THE MOUNTAINS AS UNALTERABLE AS THE WAY OF THE ETERNAL HUMAN NATURE IS GOD'S KALEIDOSCOPE AND THE LITTLE BITS OF COLOURED GLASS
359-133630-0053 WHICH REPRESENT OUR PASSIONS HOPES FEARS JOYS ASPIRATIONS TOWARDS GOOD AND EVIL AND WHAT NOT ARE TURNED IN HIS MIGHTY HAND
359-133630-0054 AS SURELY AND AS CERTAINLY AS IT TURNS THE STARS AND CONTINUALLY FALL INTO NEW PATTERNS AND COMBINATIONS BUT THE COMPOSING ELEMENTS REMAIN THE SAME
359-133630-0055 NOR WILL THERE BE ONE MORE BIT OF COLOURED GLASS NOR ONE LESS FOR EVER AND EVER THIS BEING SO SUPPOSING FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT WE DIVIDE OURSELVES INTO TWENTY PARTS
359-133630-0056 NINETEEN SAVAGE AND ONE CIVILIZED WE MUST LOOK TO THE NINETEEN SAVAGE PORTIONS OF OUR NATURE IF WE WOULD REALLY UNDERSTAND OURSELVES AND NOT TO THE TWENTIETH
359-133630-0057 IS SPREAD ALL OVER THE OTHER NINETEEN MAKING THEM APPEAR QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY REALLY ARE AS THE BLACKING DOES A BOOT OR THE VENEER A TABLE IT IS ON THE NINETEEN ROUGH
359-133630-0058 SERVICEABLE SAVAGE PORTIONS THAT WE FALL BACK ON EMERGENCIES NOT ON THE POLISHED BUT UNSUBSTANTIAL TWENTIETH CIVILIZATION SHOULD WIPE AWAY OUR TEARS
359-133630-0059 CIVILIZATION FAILS US UTTERLY BACK BACK WE CREEP AND LAY US LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN ON THE GREAT BREAST OF NATURE SHE THAT PERCHANCE MAY SOOTHE US AND MAKE US FORGET
359-133630-0060 WHO GAVE US BIRTH AND WILL IN A DAY TO COME GIVE US OUR BURIAL ALSO AND SO IN MY TROUBLE AS I WALKED UP AND DOWN THE OAK PANELLED VESTIBULE OF MY HOUSE THERE IN YORKSHIRE
359-133630-0061 I LONGED ONCE MORE TO THROW MYSELF INTO THE ARMS OF NATURE NOT THE NATURE WHICH YOU KNOW THE NATURE THAT WAVES IN WELL KEPT WOODS AND SMILES OUT IN CORN FIELDS BUT NATURE
359-133630-0062 UNDEFILED AS YET BY ANY HUMAN SINKS OF SWELTERING HUMANITY I WOULD GO AGAIN WHERE THE WILD GAME WAS BACK TO THE LAND WHEREOF NONE KNOW THE HISTORY BACK TO THE SAVAGES WHOM I LOVE
359-133630-0063 LYING IN THE CHURCHYARD WITHOUT FEELING AS THOUGH MY HEART WOULD BREAK IN TWO AND NOW THERE IS AN END OF THIS EGOTISTICAL TALK AND THERE SHALL BE NO MORE OF IT
359-133630-0064 BUT IF YOU WHOSE EYES MAY PERCHANCE ONE DAY FALL UPON MY WRITTEN THOUGHTS HAVE GOT SO FAR AS THIS I ASK YOU TO PERSEVERE SINCE WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU IS NOT WITHOUT ITS INTEREST
