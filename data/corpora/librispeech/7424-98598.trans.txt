7424-98598-0000 TO ALL WHO LOVE AND RELISH THE SIMPLE GOSPEL OF THE GRACE OF GOD I WOULD EARNESTLY RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING NOTES ON THE BOOK OF GENESIS THEY ARE CHARACTERIZED BY A DEEP TONED EVANGELICAL SPIRIT
7424-98598-0001 I CAN SPEAK AS ONE WHO HAS FOUND PROFIT THEREFROM MAN'S COMPLETE RUIN IN SIN AND GOD'S PERFECT REMEDY IN CHRIST ARE FULLY CLEARLY AND OFTEN STRIKINGLY PRESENTED ESPECIALLY IN THE EARLIER CHAPTERS
7424-98598-0002 TO CHRIST'S SERVANTS IN THE GOSPEL SOUND FORCIBLE STATEMENTS AS TO WHAT SIN IS AND WHAT GRACE IS ARE DEEPLY VALUABLE IN THE PRESENT TIME WHEN SO MUCH THAT IS MERELY SUPERFICIAL IS ABROAD
7424-98598-0003 THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST AS PERFECTLY MEETING MAN'S NATURE CONDITION AND CHARACTER IS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE KNOWN AND LESS PROCLAIMED HENCE THE NUMEROUS DOUBTS FEARS AND UNSETTLED QUESTIONS WHICH FILL THE HEARTS
7424-98598-0004 AND PERPLEX THE CONSCIENCES OF MANY OF GOD'S DEAR CHILDREN UNTIL THE SOUL IS LED TO SEE THAT THE ENTIRE QUESTION OF SIN AND THE CLAIMS OF DIVINE HOLINESS WERE ALL AND FOREVER SETTLED ON THE CROSS
7424-98598-0005 BUT THE ONE PERFECT SACRIFICE OF CHRIST OFFERED TO GOD FOR US ON THE CROSS FOR EVEN CHRIST OUR PASSOVER IS SACRIFICED FOR US
7424-98598-0006 THERE AND THERE ALONE IT WILL FIND A PERFECT ANSWER TO ITS EVERY CLAIM BECAUSE THERE IT WILL FIND THROUGH BELIEVING ALL GROUND OF DOUBT AND FEAR REMOVED THE WHOLE QUESTION OF SIN ETERNALLY SETTLED
7424-98598-0007 EVERY DIVINE REQUIREMENT FULLY MET AND A SOLID FOUNDATION LAID FOR PRESENT SETTLED PEACE IN THE PRESENCE OF DIVINE HOLINESS CHRIST DELIVERED FOR OUR OFFENCES AND RAISED AGAIN FOR OUR JUSTIFICATION
7424-98598-0008 SETTLES EVERY THING THE MOMENT WE BELIEVE THE GOSPEL WE ARE SAVED AND OUGHT TO BE DIVINELY HAPPY HE THAT BELIEVETH ON THE SON HATH EVERLASTING LIFE
7424-98598-0009 WE SEE THE GREATNESS OF GOD'S LOVE TO THE SINNER IN HIS JUDGMENT OF SIN IN THE PERSON OF HIS OWN DEAR SON ON THE CROSS THERE GOD IN PERFECT GRACE TO US
7424-98598-0010 DEALT WITH SIN ACCORDING TO HIS INFINITE HOLINESS AND JUSTICE HE WENT DOWN TO THE DEPTHS OF OUR RUIN AND ALL OUR SIN MEASURED IT
7424-98598-0011 BY SHEDDING THE PRECIOUS BLOOD OF THE SPOTLESS VICTIM HE CONDEMNED SIN IN THE FLESH THAT IS HE THERE CONDEMNED THE EVIL ROOT OF SIN WHICH IS IN OUR FLESH OUR CARNAL NATURE
7424-98598-0012 BUT HE ALSO MADE AN END OF SINS OF THE ACTUAL SINS OF EVERY BELIEVER THUS BETWEEN GOD AND CHRIST ALONE THE ENTIRE QUESTION OF SIN WAS GONE INTO AND FINALLY SETTLED ON THE CROSS
7424-98598-0013 SIMON PETER SAID UNTO HIM LORD WHITHER GOEST THOU JESUS ANSWERED HIM WHITHER I GO THOU CANST NOT FOLLOW ME NOW
7424-98598-0014 JUST AS ABRAHAM AND ISAAC WERE ALONE ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN IN THE LAND OF MORIAH SO WERE GOD AND CHRIST ALONE AMIDST THE SOLEMNITIES AND SOLITUDES OF CALVARY THE ONLY PART WE HAD IN THE CROSS WAS
7424-98598-0015 THAT OUR SINS WERE THERE JESUS ALONE BORE THE FULL WEIGHT OF THEIR JUDGMENT
7424-98598-0016 WHENEVER THIS BLESSED TRUTH IS LEARNT FROM GOD'S OWN WORD AND MAINTAINED IN THE SOUL BY FAITH THROUGH THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST ALL IS PEACE JOY AND VICTORY
7424-98598-0017 IT TAKES THE BELIEVER COMPLETELY AWAY FROM HIMSELF FROM HIS DOUBTS FEARS AND QUESTIONS AND HIS EYE NOW GAZES ON ONE WHO BY HIS FINISHED WORK HAS LAID THE FOUNDATION OF DIVINE AND EVERLASTING RIGHTEOUSNESS
7424-98598-0018 AND WHO IS NOW AT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE MAJESTY IN THE HIGHEST AS THE PERFECT DEFINITION OF EVERY TRUE BELIEVER WITH HIM WITH HIM ALONE THE BELIEVER'S HEART IS NOW TO BE OCCUPIED

7424-98598-0023 IN THE POWER OF THAT LIFE IN RESURRECTION HAVING BEEN CLEANSED BY HIS BLOOD THEY ARE ACCEPTED IN HIS PERSON
7424-98598-0024 JESUS HAVING THUS FULLY ACCOMPLISHED THE WORK THAT WAS GIVEN HIM TO DO AND GONE UP ON HIGH THE HOLY GHOST CAME DOWN AS A WITNESS TO US THAT REDEMPTION WAS FINISHED THE BELIEVER PERFECTED FOREVER
7424-98598-0025 AND CHRIST GLORIFIED IN HEAVEN THE APOSTLES THEN BEGAN TO PUBLISH THE GLAD TIDINGS OF SALVATION TO THE CHIEF OF SINNERS THE SUBJECT OF THEIR PREACHING WAS JESUS AND THE RESURRECTION
