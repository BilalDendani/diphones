6724-73991-0000 IN THIS HE WAS UNSUCCESSFUL
6724-73991-0001 BUT SHE ALWAYS DISAPPEARED AS SOON AS SEEN OCCASIONALLY AS HE CROSSED THE POINT HE SAW HER WORKING IN HER GARDEN BUT HE NEVER WENT VERY NEAR THE HOUSE FEELING THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO SPY ON IT OR HER IN ANY WAY HE SOON BECAME CONVINCED THAT SHE AVOIDED HIM PURPOSELY
6724-73991-0002 AND THE CONVICTION PIQUED HIM HE FELT AN ODD MASTERFUL DESIRE TO MEET HER FACE TO FACE AND MAKE HER LOOK AT HIM
6724-73991-0003 YET HE INEVITABLY WENT
6724-73991-0004 SOMETHING HAD COME BETWEEN HIS SOUL AND THE SOUL OF THE WILDERNESS SOMETHING HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE OR FORMULATE A NAMELESS HAUNTING LONGING THAT SHAPED ITSELF ABOUT THE MEMORY OF A COLD SWEET FACE AND STARRY INDIFFERENT EYES GREY AS THE LAKE AT DAWN
6724-73991-0005 OF CAPTAIN ANTHONY HE NEVER GOT EVEN A GLIMPSE
6724-73991-0006 BUT AFTER GAZING AT HIM A MOMENT IN A SOMEWHAT SCRUTINIZING MANNER SHE SAID BRIEFLY YOU MAY IF YOU LIKE ALAN TOOK THE PAILS AND FOLLOWED HER THE PATH NOT BEING WIDE ENOUGH FOR TWO
6724-73991-0007 SHE STRODE ON BEFORE HIM AT A RAPID VIGOROUS PACE UNTIL THEY CAME OUT INTO THE YARD BY THE HOUSE ALAN FELT HIS HEART BEATING FOOLISHLY WOULD HE SEE LYNDE OLIVER WOULD YOU MAY CARRY THE WATER THERE THE OLD WOMAN SAID POINTING TO A LITTLE OUTHOUSE NEAR THE PINES
6724-73991-0008 I'M WASHING THE SPRING WATER IS SOFTER THAN THE WELL WATER THANK YOU AS ALAN SET THE PAILS DOWN ON A BENCH I'M NOT SO YOUNG AS I WAS AND BRINGING THE WATER SO FAR TIRES ME LYNDE ALWAYS BRINGS IT FOR ME WHEN SHE'S HOME
6724-73991-0009 IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM TO WONDER WHY IT SHOULD PLEASE HIM IF HE HAD HUNTED THAT FEELING DOWN HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED TO DISCOVER THAT IT HAD ITS ORIGIN IN A CURIOUS GRATIFICATION
6724-73991-0010 HE PREFERRED HER UNSMILING DOURNESS TO VULGAR GARRULITY ARE YOU THE YOUNG MINISTER UP AT REXTON SHE ASKED BLUNTLY YES I THOUGHT SO LYNDE SAID SHE HAD SEEN YOU ON THE SHORE ONCE WELL
6724-73991-0011 SHE CAST AN UNCERTAIN GLANCE OVER HER SHOULDER AT THE HOUSE I'M MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU ALAN HAD AN IDEA THAT THAT WAS NOT WHAT SHE HAD THOUGHT OF SAYING
6724-73991-0012 THERE SEEMED NOTHING FOR HIM TO DO BUT TO GO WAIT A MOMENT
6724-73991-0013 I BELIEVE NO ILL OF ANYONE UNTIL I HAVE ABSOLUTE PROOF OF IT SAID ALAN SMILING HE WAS QUITE UNCONSCIOUS WHAT A WINNING SMILE HE HAD WHICH WAS THE BEST OF IT AND I NEVER PUT FAITH IN GOSSIP OF COURSE YOU ARE GOSSIPPED ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT YES I KNOW IT GRIMLY
6724-73991-0014 WE ARE A QUEER PAIR JUST AS QUEER AS THEY MAKE US OUT YOU CAN BELIEVE WHAT YOU LIKE ABOUT US BUT DON'T YOU BELIEVE A WORD THEY SAY AGAINST LYNDE
6724-73991-0015 IF HIS OBJECT WERE TO PROLONG THE CONVERSATION ABOUT LYNDE HE WAS DISAPPOINTED FOR THE OLD WOMAN HAD TURNED ABRUPTLY TO HER WORK AGAIN AND THOUGH ALAN LINGERED FOR A FEW MOMENTS LONGER SHE TOOK NO FURTHER NOTICE OF HIM
6724-73991-0016 AND THAT WAS ALL SHE'S EVER SEEN OF MARRIAGE
6724-73991-0017 ON HIS WAY HOME THAT NIGHT ALAN MET ISABEL KING ON THE MAIN SHORE ROAD SHE CARRIED AN ARMFUL OF PINE BOUGHS AND SAID SHE WANTED THE NEEDLES FOR A CUSHION
6724-73991-0018 YET THE THOUGHT CAME INTO ALAN'S MIND THAT SHE WAS SPYING ON HIM AND ALTHOUGH HE TRIED TO DISMISS IT AS UNWORTHY IT CONTINUED TO LURK THERE FOR A WEEK HE AVOIDED THE SHORE
6724-73991-0019 THERE WAS NO SIGN OF LIFE ABOUT FOUR WINDS AND THE SHORE SEEMED AS LONELY AND VIRGIN AS IF HUMAN FOOT HAD NEVER TRODDEN IT
6724-73991-0020 AND THOUGH EVERY FLUTTER OF WIND IN THE SCRUB FIRS MADE ALAN'S HEART BEAT EXPECTANTLY HE SAW NOTHING OF LYNDE OLIVER HE WAS ON THE POINT OF TURNING HOMEWARD WITH AN UNREASONING SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT
6724-73991-0021 INSTANTLY HE SET OFF AFTER HIM AND THE DOG WITH A FINAL SHARP BARK OF SATISFACTION SPRANG UP THE LOW BANK INTO THE SPRUCES ALAN FOLLOWED HIM ACROSS THE PENINSULA AND THEN ALONG THE FURTHER SHORE WHICH RAPIDLY GREW STEEP AND HIGH
6724-73991-0022 HALF A MILE DOWN THE CLIFFS WERE ROCKY AND PRECIPITOUS WHILE THE BEACH BENEATH THEM WAS HEAPED WITH HUGE BOULDERS ALAN FOLLOWED THE DOG ALONG ONE OF THE NARROW PATHS WITH WHICH THE BARRENS ABOUNDED UNTIL NEARLY A MILE FROM FOUR WINDS THEN THE ANIMAL HALTED
6724-73991-0023 THE EXTREME DANGER OF HER POSITION WAS MANIFEST AT A GLANCE
6724-73991-0024 LYNDE LAY MOVELESSLY HER FACE WAS WHITE AND BOTH FEAR AND APPEAL WERE VISIBLE IN HER LARGE DILATED EYES YET SHE WAS QUITE CALM AND A FAINT SMILE CROSSED HER PALE LIPS AS SHE SAW THE MAN AND THE DOG GOOD FAITHFUL PAT SO YOU DID BRING HELP SHE SAID
6724-73991-0025 BUT HOW CAN I HELP YOU MISS OLIVER SAID ALAN HOARSELY
6724-73991-0026 AND LEAVE YOU HERE ALONE IN SUCH DANGER PAT WILL STAY WITH ME BESIDES THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO DO YOU
6724-73991-0027 FATHER AND EMILY ARE AWAY I THINK I AM QUITE SAFE HERE IF I DON'T MOVE AT ALL
6724-73991-0028 AND MUCH AS HE HATED TO LEAVE HER ALONE THUS HE REALIZED THAT HE MUST LOSE NO TIME IN DOING IT I'LL BE BACK AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HE SAID HURRIEDLY
6724-73991-0029 WHEN HE REACHED THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT HE DREADED TO LOOK OVER THE BROKEN EDGE BUT SHE WAS LYING THERE SAFELY AND SHE SMILED WHEN SHE SAW HIM
6724-73991-0030 AND THEN DRAW YOURSELF UP THE SLOPE HAND OVER HAND ASKED ALAN ANXIOUSLY YES SHE ANSWERED FEARLESSLY ALAN PASSED DOWN ONE END OF THE ROPE AND THEN BRACED HIMSELF FIRMLY TO HOLD IT FOR THERE WAS NO TREE NEAR ENOUGH TO BE OF ANY ASSISTANCE THE NEXT MOMENT THE FULL WEIGHT OF HER BODY SWUNG FROM IT
6724-73991-0031 FOR AT HER FIRST MOVEMENT THE SOIL BENEATH HER SLIPPED AWAY ALAN'S HEART SICKENED WHAT IF SHE WENT WITH IT COULD SHE CLING TO THE ROPE WHILE HE DREW HER UP THEN HE SAW SHE WAS STILL SAFE ON THE SLOPING SHELF CAREFULLY AND PAINFULLY SHE DREW HERSELF TO HER KNEES
6724-73991-0032 WHEN SHE CAME WITHIN HIS REACH HE GRASPED HER ARMS AND LIFTED HER UP INTO SAFETY BESIDE HIM THANK GOD HE SAID WITH WHITER LIPS THAN HER OWN FOR A FEW MOMENTS LYNDE SAT SILENT ON THE SOD
6724-73991-0033 FINALLY SHE LOOKED UP INTO ALAN'S ANXIOUS FACE AND THEIR EYES MET IT WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE PHYSICAL REACTION THAT SUDDENLY FLUSHED THE GIRL'S CHEEKS SHE SPRANG LITHELY TO HER FEET CAN YOU WALK BACK HOME ALAN ASKED
6724-73991-0034 WHEN I CAME HERE I SAW SOME JUNEBELLS GROWING RIGHT OUT ON THE LEDGE AND I CREPT OUT TO GATHER THEM
6724-73991-0035 I THOUGHT IT WOULD GO RIGHT OVER THE BRINK SHE GAVE A LITTLE INVOLUNTARY SHUDDER BUT JUST AT THE VERY EDGE IT STOPPED I KNEW I MUST LIE VERY STILL OR IT WOULD GO RIGHT OVER
6724-73991-0036 HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING MORE TO SAY
6724-73991-0037 YOU SAVED MY LIFE SHE SAID YOU AND PAT FOR DOGGIE MUST HAVE HIS SHARE OF CREDIT A MUCH LARGER SHARE THAN MINE SAID ALAN SMILING IF PAT HAD NOT COME FOR ME I WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN OF YOUR DANGER WHAT A MAGNIFICENT FELLOW HE IS
6724-73991-0038 ISN'T HE SHE AGREED PROUDLY AND SO IS LADDIE MY OTHER DOG HE WENT WITH FATHER TODAY I LOVE MY DOGS MORE THAN PEOPLE SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH A LITTLE DEFIANCE IN HER EYES I SUPPOSE YOU THINK THAT TERRIBLE
6724-73991-0039 I THINK MANY DOGS ARE MUCH MORE LOVABLE AND WORTHY OF LOVE THAN MANY PEOPLE SAID ALAN LAUGHING HOW CHILDLIKE SHE WAS IN SOME WAYS THAT TRACE OF DEFIANCE IT WAS SO LIKE A CHILD WHO EXPECTED TO BE SCOLDED FOR SOME WRONG ATTITUDE OF MIND
6724-73991-0040 AND YET THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN SHE LOOKED THE TALL PROUD QUEEN SOMETIMES WHEN THE PATH GREW NARROW SHE WALKED BEFORE HIM HER HAND ON THE DOG'S HEAD
6724-73991-0041 WHICH TODAY WAS WOUND ABOUT HER HEAD WHEN SHE DROPPED BACK BESIDE HIM IN THE WIDER SPACES HE COULD ONLY HAVE STOLEN GLANCES AT HER PROFILE DELICATELY STRONGLY CUT VIRGINAL IN ITS SOFT CURVES CHILDLIKE IN ITS PURITY
6724-73991-0042 A POWER WHICH HER HITHERTO UNFETTERED SPIRIT HAD NEVER BEFORE FELT THE COLD INDIFFERENCE HE HAD SEEN IN HER FACE AT THEIR FIRST MEETING WAS GONE AND SOMETHING TOLD HIM IT WAS GONE FOREVER
6724-73991-0043 WHEN THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF FOUR WINDS THEY SAW TWO PEOPLE WALKING UP THE ROAD FROM THE HARBOUR AND A FEW FURTHER STEPS BROUGHT THEM FACE TO FACE WITH CAPTAIN ANTHONY OLIVER AND HIS OLD HOUSEKEEPER THE CAPTAIN'S APPEARANCE WAS A FRESH SURPRISE TO ALAN
6724-73991-0044 INSTEAD CAPTAIN ANTHONY WAS A TALL WELL BUILT MAN OF PERHAPS FIFTY HIS FACE BENEATH ITS SHOCK OF IRON GREY HAIR WAS HANDSOME BUT WORE A SOMEWHAT FORBIDDING EXPRESSION
6724-73991-0045 APART FROM LINE OR FEATURE WHICH DID NOT PLEASE ALAN
6724-73991-0046 THE FRONT DOOR OF FOUR WINDS OPENED DIRECTLY INTO A WIDE LOW CEILINGED LIVING ROOM FURNISHED WITH SIMPLICITY AND GOOD TASTE LEAVING THE TWO MEN THERE LYNDE AND THE OLD COUSIN VANISHED AND ALAN FOUND HIMSELF TALKING FREELY WITH THE CAPTAIN WHO COULD AS IT APPEARED
6724-73991-0047 TALK WELL ON MANY SUBJECTS FAR REMOVED FROM FOUR WINDS HE WAS EVIDENTLY A CLEVER SELF EDUCATED MAN SOMEWHAT OPINIONATED AND GIVEN TO SARCASM HE NEVER MADE ANY REFERENCES TO HIS OWN PAST LIFE OR EXPERIENCES
6724-73991-0048 BUT ALAN DISCOVERED HIM TO BE SURPRISINGLY WELL READ IN POLITICS AND SCIENCE
6724-73991-0049 PRESENTLY LYNDE CAME IN
6724-73991-0050 AND HER LONG THICK BRAID OF HAIR HUNG OVER HER SHOULDER
6724-73991-0051 EMILY CAME IN AND LIGHTED THE LAMP ON THE TABLE SHE WAS AS GRIM AND UNSMILING AS EVER YET SHE CAST A LOOK OF SATISFACTION ON ALAN AS SHE PASSED OUT ONE DOG LAY DOWN AT LYNDE'S FEET THE OTHER SAT ON HIS HAUNCHES BY HER SIDE AND LAID HIS HEAD ON HER LAP
6724-73991-0052 AND HE WONDERED A LITTLE IF THIS WERE NOT ALL A DREAM WHEN HE WENT AWAY THE CAPTAIN INVITED HIM BACK IF YOU LIKE TO COME THAT IS HE SAID BRUSQUELY
6724-73991-0053 I NEVER TALK RELIGION SAID ALAN EMPHATICALLY I TRY TO LIVE IT I'LL NOT COME TO YOUR HOUSE AS A SELF APPOINTED MISSIONARY SIR
6724-73991-0054 OH I WON'T INSULT YOUR GOD SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH A FAINT SNEER ALAN WENT HOME IN A TUMULT OF CONTENDING FEELINGS HE DID NOT ALTOGETHER LIKE CAPTAIN ANTHONY THAT WAS VERY CLEAR TO HIM AND YET THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE MAN THAT ATTRACTED HIM
6724-73991-0055 INTELLECTUALLY HE WAS A WORTHY FOEMAN AND ALAN HAD OFTEN LONGED FOR SUCH SINCE COMING TO REXTON HE MISSED THE KEEN STIMULATING DEBATES OF HIS COLLEGE DAYS AND NOW THERE SEEMED A CHANCE OF RENEWING THEM HE WAS EAGER TO GRASP IT
6724-73991-0056 AND LYNDE HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE WAS WHAT THOUGH SHE SHARED AS WAS NOT UNLIKELY IN HER FATHER'S LACK OF BELIEF SHE COULD NOT BE ESSENTIALLY IRRELIGIOUS THAT WERE IMPOSSIBLE IN A TRUE WOMAN MIGHT NOT THIS BE HIS OPPORTUNITY TO HELP HER
6724-73991-0057 TO LEAD HER INTO DEARER LIGHT ALAN DOUGLAS WAS A SINCERE MAN WITH HIMSELF AS WELL AS WITH OTHERS
6724-73991-0058 AS HE HAD THAT DAY RESCUED HER FROM BODILY DANGER
