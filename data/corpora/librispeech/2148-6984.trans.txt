2148-6984-0000 AND BY TWELVE O'CLOCK WERE OUT OF THE CANAL AND OFF POINT CONCEPTION
2148-6984-0001 THIS IS THE LARGEST POINT ON THE COAST AND IS UNINHABITED HEADLAND STRETCHING OUT INTO THE PACIFIC AND HAS THE REPUTATION OF BEING VERY WINDY
2148-6984-0002 ANY VESSEL DOES WELL WHICH GETS BY IT WITHOUT A GALE ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTER SEASON WE WERE GOING ALONG WITH STUDDING SAILS SET ON BOTH SIDES WHEN AS WE CAME ROUND THE POINT
2148-6984-0003 WE HAD TO HAUL OUR WIND AND TAKE IN THE LEE STUDDING SAILS AS THE BRIG CAME MORE UPON THE WIND SHE FELT IT MORE AND WE DOUSED THE SKY SAILS BUT KEPT THE WEATHER STUDDING SAILS ON HER
2148-6984-0004 BRACING THE YARDS FORWARD SO THAT THE SWINGING BOOM NEARLY TOUCHED THE SPRIT SAIL YARD SHE NOW LAY OVER TO IT THE WIND WAS FRESHENING
2148-6984-0005 SAID SOMETHING TO HIM BUT HE ONLY ANSWERED THAT HE KNEW THE VESSEL AND WHAT SHE WOULD CARRY
2148-6984-0006 THEN IT WAS HAUL DOWN AND CLEW UP ROYALS FLYING JIB AND STUDDING SAILS ALL AT ONCE THERE WAS WHAT THE SAILORS CALL A MESS EVERYTHING LET GO NOTHING HAULED IN AND EVERYTHING FLYING
2148-6984-0007 WHICH HAD BLOWN OVER THE SPRIT SAIL YARD ARM AND ROUND THE GUYS WHILE THE TOPMAST STUDDING SAIL BOOM AFTER BUCKLING UP AND SPRINGING OUT AGAIN LIKE A PIECE OF WHALEBONE BROKE OFF AT THE BOOM IRON
2148-6984-0008 BUT BEFORE I GOT INTO THE TOP THE TACK PARTED AND AWAY WENT THE SAIL SWINGING FORWARD OF THE TOP GALLANT SAIL AND TEARING AND SLATTING ITSELF TO PIECES THE HALYARDS WERE AT THIS MOMENT LET GO BY THE RUN
2148-6984-0009 AFTER GREAT EXERTIONS I GOT IT OR THE REMAINS OF IT INTO THE TOP AND WAS MAKING IT FAST WHEN THE CAPTAIN LOOKING UP CALLED OUT TO ME
2148-6984-0010 LEAVING THE STUDDING SAIL I WENT UP TO THE CROSS TREES AND HERE IT LOOKED RATHER SQUALLY THE FOOT OF THE TOP GALLANT MAST WAS WORKING BETWEEN THE CROSS AND TRUSSEL TREES
2148-6984-0011 WHILE EVERYTHING WAS WORKING AND CRACKING STRAINED TO THE UTMOST THERE'S NOTHING FOR JACK TO DO BUT TO OBEY ORDERS AND I WENT UP UPON THE YARD
2148-6984-0012 AND THERE WAS A WORSE MESS IF POSSIBLE THAN I HAD LEFT BELOW THE BRACES HAD BEEN LET GO AND THE YARD WAS SWINGING ABOUT LIKE A TURNPIKE GATE AND THE WHOLE SAIL
2148-6984-0013 FORTUNATELY IT WAS NOON AND BROAD DAYLIGHT
2148-6984-0014 SOON SAW MY DIFFICULTY AND AFTER NUMBERLESS SIGNS AND GESTURES GOT SOME ONE TO HAUL THE NECESSARY ROPES TAUT DURING THIS INTERVAL I TOOK A LOOK BELOW EVERYTHING WAS IN CONFUSION ON DECK
2148-6984-0015 WHICH WAS BLOWING FROM HIM AS FAST AS HE COULD GATHER IT IN THE TOP GALLANT SAIL BELOW ME WAS SOON CLEWED UP WHICH RELIEVED THE MAST AND IN A SHORT TIME I GOT MY SAIL FURLED AND WENT BELOW BUT I LOST OVERBOARD A NEW TARPAULIN HAT
2148-6984-0016 WHICH TROUBLED ME MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WE WORKED FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WITH MIGHT AND MAIN AND IN AN HOUR FROM THE TIME THE SQUALL STRUCK US FROM HAVING ALL OUR FLYING KITES ABROAD
2148-6984-0017 THE WIND HAD HAULED AHEAD DURING THE SQUALL AND WE WERE STANDING DIRECTLY IN FOR THE POINT SO AS SOON AS WE HAD GOT ALL SNUG WE WORE ROUND AND STOOD OFF AGAIN
2148-6984-0018 A DISTANCE OF AN HUNDRED MILES AGAINST A VIOLENT HEAD WIND BEFORE NIGHT IT BEGAN TO RAIN AND WE HAD FIVE DAYS OF RAINY STORMY WEATHER UNDER CLOSE SAIL ALL THE TIME AND WERE BLOWN SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES OFF THE COAST
2148-6984-0019 IN THE MIDST OF THIS WE DISCOVERED THAT OUR FORE TOPMAST WAS SPRUNG WHICH NO DOUBT HAPPENED IN THE SQUALL AND WERE OBLIGED TO SEND DOWN THE FORE TOP GALLANT MAST AND CARRY AS LITTLE SAIL AS POSSIBLE FORWARD
2148-6984-0020 SO THAT WE SAW LITTLE OR NOTHING OF THEM DURING THE FIVE DAYS ON THE SIXTH DAY IT CLEARED OFF AND THE SUN CAME OUT BRIGHT BUT THE WIND AND SEA WERE STILL VERY HIGH
2148-6984-0021 NO LAND FOR HUNDREDS OF MILES AND THE CAPTAIN TAKING THE SUN EVERY DAY AT NOON OUR PASSENGERS NOW MADE THEIR APPEARANCE AND I HAD FOR THE FIRST TIME THE OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING
2148-6984-0022 WHAT A MISERABLE AND FORLORN CREATURE A SEA SICK PASSENGER IS
2148-6984-0023 THE THIRD DAY FROM BOSTON I HAD SEEN NOTHING BUT HALE HEARTY MEN WITH THEIR SEA LEGS ON AND ABLE TO GO ANYWHERE
2148-6984-0024 STAGGERING AND SHUFFLING ABOUT DECKS OR HOLDING ON AND LOOKING UP WITH GIDDY HEADS TO SEE US CLIMBING TO THE MAST HEADS
2148-6984-0025 AS WE DREW IN AND RAN DOWN THE SHORE WE COULD DISTINGUISH WELL THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY AND FOUND IT BETTER WOODED THAN THAT TO THE SOUTHWARD OF POINT CONCEPTION IN FACT AS I AFTERWARDS DISCOVERED
2148-6984-0026 POINT CONCEPTION MAY BE MADE THE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT FACES OF THE COUNTRY AS YOU GO TO THE NORTHWARD OF THE POINT THE COUNTRY BECOMES MORE WOODED HAS A RICHER APPEARANCE AND IS BETTER SUPPLIED WITH WATER
2148-6984-0027 THIS IS THE CASE WITH MONTEREY AND STILL MORE SO WITH SAN FRANCISCO
2148-6984-0028 SAN PEDRO AND PARTICULARLY SAN DIEGO THERE IS VERY LITTLE WOOD AND THE COUNTRY HAS A NAKED LEVEL APPEARANCE
2148-6984-0029 ANO NUEVO AT THE NORTH AND PINOS AT THE SOUTH BUT NARROWS GRADUALLY AS YOU APPROACH THE TOWN WHICH IS SITUATED IN A BEND OR LARGE COVE AT THE SOUTH EASTERN EXTREMITY
2148-6984-0030 THE SHORES ARE EXTREMELY WELL WOODED THE PINE ABOUNDING UPON THEM AND AS IT WAS NOW THE RAINY SEASON EVERYTHING WAS AS GREEN AS NATURE COULD MAKE IT THE GRASS THE LEAVES AND ALL THE BIRDS WERE SINGING IN THE WOODS
2148-6984-0031 HERE WE COULD LIE SAFE FROM THE SOUTH EASTERS WE CAME TO ANCHOR WITHIN TWO CABLE LENGTHS OF THE SHORE AND THE TOWN LAY DIRECTLY BEFORE US MAKING A VERY PRETTY APPEARANCE
2148-6984-0032 WHICH GIVES A MUCH BETTER EFFECT THAN THOSE OF SANTA BARBARA
2148-6984-0033 UPON WHICH THE HOUSES ABOUT AN HUNDRED IN NUMBER WERE DOTTED ABOUT HERE AND THERE IRREGULARLY
2148-6984-0034 NO STREETS OR FENCES
2148-6984-0035 SO THAT THE HOUSES ARE PLACED AT RANDOM UPON THE GREEN
2148-6984-0036 GIVES THEM A PRETTY EFFECT WHEN SEEN FROM A LITTLE DISTANCE IT WAS A FINE SATURDAY AFTERNOON WHEN WE CAME TO ANCHOR THE SUN ABOUT AN HOUR HIGH AND EVERYTHING LOOKING PLEASANTLY
2148-6984-0037 THE MEXICAN FLAG WAS FLYING FROM THE LITTLE SQUARE PRESIDIO AND THE DRUMS AND TRUMPETS OF THE SOLDIERS WHO WERE OUT ON PARADE SOUNDED OVER THE WATER AND GAVE GREAT LIFE TO THE SCENE EVERY ONE WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE APPEARANCE OF THINGS
2148-6984-0038 WHICH IN THE SAILOR'S VOCABULARY MEANS CIVILIZED COUNTRY
2148-6984-0039 THE OPEN ROADSTEAD OF SANTA BARBARA ANCHORING THREE MILES FROM THE SHORE RUNNING OUT TO SEA BEFORE EVERY SOUTH EASTER LANDING IN A HIGH SURF WITH A LITTLE DARK LOOKING TOWN A MILE FROM THE BEACH AND NOT A SOUND TO BE HEARD OR ANYTHING TO BE SEEN
2148-6984-0040 ADD TO THIS THE GALE OFF POINT CONCEPTION AND NO ONE CAN BE AT A LOSS TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR AGREEABLE DISAPPOINTMENT IN MONTEREY
2148-6984-0041 WHICH WAS OF NO SMALL IMPORTANCE TO US THAT THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO SURF HERE
2148-6984-0042 WE LANDED THE AGENT AND PASSENGERS AND FOUND SEVERAL PERSONS WAITING FOR THEM ON THE BEACH AMONG WHOM WERE SOME WHO THOUGH DRESSED IN THE COSTUME OF THE COUNTRY SPOKE ENGLISH AND WHO WE AFTERWARDS LEARNED
2148-6984-0043 WHICH MORE NEARLY CONCERNS MYSELF
2148-6984-0044 MY FIRST ACT OF WHAT THE SAILORS WILL ALLOW TO BE SEAMANSHIP SENDING DOWN A ROYAL YARD I HAD SEEN IT DONE ONCE OR TWICE AT SEA AND AN OLD SAILOR WHOSE FAVOR I HAD TAKEN SOME PAINS TO GAIN
2148-6984-0045 HAD TAUGHT ME CAREFULLY EVERYTHING WHICH WAS NECESSARY TO BE DONE AND IN ITS PROPER ORDER AND ADVISED ME TO TAKE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY WHEN WE WERE IN PORT AND TRY IT I TOLD THE SECOND MATE WITH WHOM I HAD BEEN PRETTY THICK WHEN HE WAS BEFORE THE MAST
2148-6984-0046 FOR THE SLIGHTEST MISTAKE SPOILS THE WHOLE
