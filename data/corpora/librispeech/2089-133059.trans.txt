2089-133059-0000 ONE OF US TWO MUST BOWEN DOUTELESS AND SITH A MAN IS MORE REASONABLE THAN WOMAN IS YE MEN MOSTE BE SUFFRABLE CHAUCER
2089-133059-0001 WHAT WONDER THEN THAT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO OLD SIR GODWIN LYDGATE WAS SLOW TO WRITE A LETTER WHICH WAS OF CONSEQUENCE TO OTHERS RATHER THAN TO HIMSELF
2089-133059-0002 AND ROSAMOND AWAITING AN ANSWER TO HER WINNING APPEAL WAS EVERY DAY DISAPPOINTED LYDGATE IN TOTAL IGNORANCE OF HER EXPECTATIONS WAS SEEING THE BILLS COME IN AND FEELING THAT DOVER'S USE OF HIS ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER CREDITORS WAS IMMINENT
2089-133059-0003 HE HAD NEVER MENTIONED TO ROSAMOND HIS BROODING PURPOSE OF GOING TO QUALLINGHAM HE DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT
2089-133059-0004 UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT BUT HE WAS REALLY EXPECTING TO SET OFF SOON
2089-133059-0005 WOULD ENABLE HIM TO MANAGE THE WHOLE JOURNEY AND BACK IN FOUR DAYS BUT ONE MORNING AFTER LYDGATE HAD GONE OUT A LETTER CAME ADDRESSED TO HIM WHICH ROSAMOND SAW CLEARLY TO BE FROM SIR GODWIN SHE WAS FULL OF HOPE
2089-133059-0006 PERHAPS THERE MIGHT BE A PARTICULAR NOTE TO HER ENCLOSED BUT LYDGATE WAS NATURALLY ADDRESSED ON THE QUESTION OF MONEY
2089-133059-0007 AND THE FACT THAT HE WAS WRITTEN TO NAY THE VERY DELAY IN WRITING AT ALL SEEMED TO CERTIFY THAT THE ANSWER WAS THOROUGHLY COMPLIANT SHE WAS TOO MUCH EXCITED BY THESE THOUGHTS TO DO ANYTHING BUT LIGHT STITCHING IN A WARM CORNER OF THE DINING ROOM
2089-133059-0008 WITH THE OUTSIDE OF THIS MOMENTOUS LETTER LYING ON THE TABLE BEFORE HER ABOUT TWELVE SHE HEARD HER HUSBAND'S STEP IN THE PASSAGE AND TRIPPING TO OPEN THE DOOR SHE SAID IN HER LIGHTEST TONES TERTIUS COME IN HERE HERE IS A LETTER FOR YOU
2089-133059-0009 AH HE SAID NOT TAKING OFF HIS HAT BUT JUST TURNING HER ROUND WITHIN HIS ARM TO WALK TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE THE LETTER LAY
2089-133059-0010 WHILE ROSAMOND RESEATED HERSELF AND WATCHED HIM AS HE OPENED THE LETTER SHE HAD EXPECTED HIM TO BE SURPRISED WHILE LYDGATE'S EYES GLANCED RAPIDLY OVER THE BRIEF LETTER
2089-133059-0011 TAKING ON A DRY WHITENESS WITH NOSTRILS AND LIPS QUIVERING HE TOSSED DOWN THE LETTER BEFORE HER AND SAID VIOLENTLY IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ENDURE LIFE WITH YOU IF YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ACTING SECRETLY ACTING IN OPPOSITION TO ME AND HIDING YOUR ACTIONS
2089-133059-0012 HE CHECKED HIS SPEECH AND TURNED HIS BACK ON HER THEN WHEELED ROUND AND WALKED ABOUT SAT DOWN AND GOT UP AGAIN RESTLESSLY
2089-133059-0013 ROSAMOND TOO HAD CHANGED COLOR AS SHE READ
2089-133059-0014 DEAR TERTIUS DON'T SET YOUR WIFE TO WRITE TO ME WHEN YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ASK IT IS A ROUNDABOUT WHEEDLING SORT OF THING WHICH I SHOULD NOT HAVE CREDITED YOU WITH I NEVER CHOOSE TO WRITE TO A WOMAN ON MATTERS OF BUSINESS
2089-133059-0015 AND TO HAVE MADE A MESS WHERE YOU ARE THE SOONER YOU GO SOMEWHERE ELSE THE BETTER BUT I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MEN OF YOUR PROFESSION AND CAN'T HELP YOU THERE I DID THE BEST I COULD FOR YOU AS GUARDIAN AND LET YOU HAVE YOUR OWN WAY IN TAKING TO MEDICINE YOU MIGHT HAVE GONE INTO THE ARMY OR THE CHURCH
2089-133059-0016 WHEN ROSAMOND HAD FINISHED READING THE LETTER SHE SAT QUITE STILL WITH HER HANDS FOLDED BEFORE HER RESTRAINING ANY SHOW OF HER KEEN DISAPPOINTMENT AND INTRENCHING HERSELF IN QUIET PASSIVITY UNDER HER HUSBAND'S WRATH
2089-133059-0017 LYDGATE PAUSED IN HIS MOVEMENTS LOOKED AT HER AGAIN AND SAID WITH BITING SEVERITY WILL THIS BE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE YOU OF THE HARM YOU MAY DO BY SECRET MEDDLING HAVE YOU SENSE ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE NOW YOUR INCOMPETENCE TO JUDGE AND ACT FOR ME
2089-133059-0018 TO INTERFERE WITH YOUR IGNORANCE IN AFFAIRS WHICH IT BELONGS TO ME TO DECIDE ON THE WORDS WERE HARD BUT THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT LYDGATE HAD BEEN FRUSTRATED BY HER SHE DID NOT LOOK AT HIM AND MADE NO REPLY
2089-133059-0019 I HAD NEARLY RESOLVED ON GOING TO QUALLINGHAM IT WOULD HAVE COST ME PAIN ENOUGH TO DO IT YET IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OF SOME USE BUT IT HAS BEEN OF NO USE FOR ME TO THINK OF ANYTHING YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COUNTERACTING ME SECRETLY YOU DELUDE ME WITH A FALSE ASSENT
2089-133059-0020 IT IS A TERRIBLE MOMENT IN YOUNG LIVES WHEN THE CLOSENESS OF LOVE'S BOND HAS TURNED TO THIS POWER OF GALLING IN SPITE OF ROSAMOND'S SELF CONTROL A TEAR FELL SILENTLY AND ROLLED OVER HER LIPS SHE STILL SAID NOTHING
2089-133059-0021 BUT UNDER THAT QUIETUDE WAS HIDDEN AN INTENSE EFFECT SHE WAS IN SUCH ENTIRE DISGUST WITH HER HUSBAND THAT SHE WISHED SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM SIR GODWIN'S RUDENESS TOWARDS HER AND UTTER WANT OF FEELING RANGED HIM WITH DOVER AND ALL OTHER CREDITORS
2089-133059-0022 AND DID NOT MIND HOW ANNOYING THEY WERE TO HER EVEN HER FATHER WAS UNKIND AND MIGHT HAVE DONE MORE FOR THEM IN FACT THERE WAS BUT ONE PERSON IN ROSAMOND'S WORLD WHOM SHE DID NOT REGARD AS BLAMEWORTHY AND THAT WAS THE GRACEFUL CREATURE WITH BLOND PLAITS
2089-133059-0023 AND WITH LITTLE HANDS CROSSED BEFORE HER
2089-133059-0024 BY MODERATING HIS WORDS CAN YOU NOT SEE ROSAMOND HE BEGAN AGAIN TRYING TO BE SIMPLY GRAVE AND NOT BITTER THAT NOTHING CAN BE SO FATAL AS A WANT OF OPENNESS AND CONFIDENCE BETWEEN US IT HAS HAPPENED AGAIN AND AGAIN
2089-133059-0025 THAT I HAVE EXPRESSED A DECIDED WISH AND YOU HAVE SEEMED TO ASSENT YET AFTER THAT YOU HAVE SECRETLY DISOBEYED MY WISH IN THAT WAY I CAN NEVER KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO TRUST TO THERE WOULD BE SOME HOPE FOR US IF YOU WOULD ADMIT THIS
2089-133059-0026 AM I SUCH AN UNREASONABLE FURIOUS BRUTE WHY SHOULD YOU NOT BE OPEN WITH ME STILL SILENCE
2089-133059-0027 WILL YOU ONLY SAY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN AND THAT I MAY DEPEND ON YOUR NOT ACTING SECRETLY IN FUTURE SAID LYDGATE URGENTLY BUT WITH SOMETHING OF REQUEST IN HIS TONE WHICH ROSAMOND WAS QUICK TO PERCEIVE SHE SPOKE WITH COOLNESS
2089-133059-0028 YOU HAVE SPOKEN OF MY SECRET MEDDLING AND MY INTERFERING IGNORANCE AND MY FALSE ASSENT I HAVE NEVER EXPRESSED MYSELF IN THAT WAY TO YOU AND I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO APOLOGIZE YOU SPOKE OF ITS BEING IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE WITH ME
2089-133059-0029 LYDGATE FLUNG HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR FEELING CHECKMATED WHAT PLACE WAS THERE IN HER MIND FOR A REMONSTRANCE TO LODGE IN HE LAID DOWN HIS HAT FLUNG AN ARM OVER THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR
2089-133059-0030 AND LOOKED DOWN FOR SOME MOMENTS WITHOUT SPEAKING ROSAMOND HAD THE DOUBLE PURCHASE OVER HIM OF INSENSIBILITY TO THE POINT OF JUSTICE IN HIS REPROACH AND OF SENSIBILITY TO THE UNDENIABLE HARDSHIPS NOW PRESENT IN HER MARRIED LIFE
2089-133059-0031 ALTHOUGH HER DUPLICITY IN THE AFFAIR OF THE HOUSE HAD EXCEEDED WHAT HE KNEW
2089-133059-0032 SHE HAD NO CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HER ACTION COULD RIGHTLY BE CALLED FALSE
2089-133059-0033 ANY MORE THAN THE MATERIALS OF OUR GROCERY AND CLOTHES ROSAMOND FELT THAT SHE WAS AGGRIEVED AND THAT THIS WAS WHAT LYDGATE HAD TO RECOGNIZE AS FOR HIM THE NEED OF ACCOMMODATING HIMSELF TO HER NATURE WHICH WAS INFLEXIBLE IN PROPORTION TO ITS NEGATIONS
2089-133059-0034 OF LOVE FOR HIM AND THE CONSEQUENT DREARINESS OF THEIR LIFE THE READY FULNESS OF HIS EMOTIONS MADE THIS DREAD ALTERNATE QUICKLY WITH THE FIRST VIOLENT MOVEMENTS OF HIS ANGER IT WOULD ASSUREDLY HAVE BEEN A VAIN BOAST IN HIM TO SAY THAT HE WAS HER MASTER
2089-133059-0035 THE HARDSHIPS WHICH OUR MARRIAGE HAS BROUGHT ON ME
2089-133059-0036 AS A PAIN MAKES AN EXAGGERATED DREAM IF HE WERE NOT ONLY TO SINK FROM HIS HIGHEST RESOLVE BUT TO SINK INTO THE HIDEOUS FETTERING OF DOMESTIC HATE ROSAMOND HE SAID TURNING HIS EYES ON HER WITH A MELANCHOLY LOOK
2089-133059-0037 YOU SHOULD ALLOW FOR A MAN'S WORDS WHEN HE IS DISAPPOINTED AND PROVOKED YOU AND I CANNOT HAVE OPPOSITE INTERESTS I CANNOT PART MY HAPPINESS FROM YOURS IF I AM ANGRY WITH YOU IT IS THAT YOU SEEM NOT TO SEE HOW ANY CONCEALMENT DIVIDES US
2089-133059-0038 HOW COULD I WISH TO MAKE ANYTHING HARD TO YOU EITHER BY MY WORDS OR CONDUCT WHEN I HURT YOU I HURT PART OF MY OWN LIFE I SHOULD NEVER BE ANGRY WITH YOU
2089-133059-0039 WITHOUT ANY NECESSITY SAID ROSAMOND THE TEARS COMING AGAIN FROM A SOFTENED FEELING NOW THAT HER HUSBAND HAD SOFTENED IT IS SO VERY HARD TO BE DISGRACED HERE AMONG ALL THE PEOPLE WE KNOW AND TO LIVE IN SUCH A MISERABLE WAY I WISH I HAD DIED WITH THE BABY
2089-133059-0040 SHE SPOKE AND WEPT WITH THAT GENTLENESS WHICH MAKES SUCH WORDS AND TEARS OMNIPOTENT OVER A LOVING HEARTED MAN LYDGATE DREW HIS CHAIR NEAR TO HERS AND PRESSED HER DELICATE HEAD AGAINST HIS CHEEK WITH HIS POWERFUL TENDER HAND
2089-133059-0041 HE ONLY CARESSED HER HE DID NOT SAY ANYTHING FOR WHAT WAS THERE TO SAY HE COULD NOT PROMISE TO SHIELD HER FROM THE DREADED WRETCHEDNESS FOR HE COULD SEE NO SURE MEANS OF DOING SO
2089-133059-0042 WHEN HE LEFT HER TO GO OUT AGAIN HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IT WAS TEN TIMES HARDER FOR HER THAN FOR HIM HE HAD A LIFE AWAY FROM HOME AND CONSTANT APPEALS TO HIS ACTIVITY ON BEHALF OF OTHERS HE WISHED TO EXCUSE EVERYTHING IN HER IF HE COULD
2089-133059-0043 BUT IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT IN THAT EXCUSING MOOD HE SHOULD THINK OF HER AS IF SHE WERE AN ANIMAL OF ANOTHER AND FEEBLER SPECIES
