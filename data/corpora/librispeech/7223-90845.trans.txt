7223-90845-0000 AND DISCOVERED A DWARF CAUGHT IN A PIT WHICH HAD BEEN DUG TO TRAP WILD ANIMALS AFTER THE HUNTER HAD RESCUED THE DWARF FROM HIS PRISON THE LITTLE MAN SAID TO HIM GO TEN LEAGUES TO THE NORTH
7223-90845-0001 TILL YOU ARRIVE AT A GIGANTIC PINE THEN TURN TO THE EAST AND GO TEN LEAGUES MORE TILL YOU COME TO A BLACK CASTLE ENTER THE CASTLE WITHOUT FEAR AND YOU WILL DISCOVER A ROUND ROOM
7223-90845-0002 HELP YOURSELF TO THE TREASURE AND RETURN HOME AT ONCE AND DO NOT NOW MARK ME WELL GO UP INTO THE TURRET OF THE CASTLE FOR IF YOU DO EVIL WILL COME OF IT
7223-90845-0003 SO THE HUNTER THANKED THE DWARF AND AFTER MAKING SURE THAT HE HAD PLENTY OF BREAD AND CHEESE IN HIS KNAPSACK HURRIED NORTHWARDS AS FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM THROUGH BRAMBLE AND BRIER
7223-90845-0004 THROUGH VALLEY AND WOODED DALE WENT HE AND AT DUSK HE CAME TO A GIGANTIC PINE STANDING SOLITARY IN A ROCKY FIELD WEARIED WITH HIS LONG JOURNEY THE HUNTER LAY DOWN BENEATH THE PINE AND SLEPT
7223-90845-0005 WHEN IT WAS DAWN HE WOKE REFRESHED AND TURNING HIS EYES TOWARD THE LEVEL RAYS OF THE RISING SUN BEGAN HIS JOURNEY TO THE EAST PRESENTLY HE REACHED A HEIGHT IN THE FOREST AND FROM THIS HEIGHT
7223-90845-0006 HE SAW NOT VERY FAR AWAY A BLACK TURRET RISING OVER THE OCEAN OF BRIGHT LEAVES AT HIGH NOON HE ARRIVED AT THE CASTLE IT WAS RUINOUS AND QUITE DESERTED
7223-90845-0007 GRASS GREW IN THE COURTYARD AND BETWEEN THE BRICKS OF THE TERRACE AND THE OAKEN DOOR WAS AS SOFT AND ROTTEN AS A LOG THAT HAS LONG BEEN BURIED IN MIRE ENTERING THE CASTLE THE HUNTER SOON DISCOVERED THE ROUND ROOM
7223-90845-0008 STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF THE CHAMBER DIRECTLY UNDER A SHOWER OF SUNLIGHT POURING THROUGH A HALF RUINED WINDOW IN THE MILDEWED WALL HOW THE DIAMONDS AND PRECIOUS STONES SPARKLED AND GLEAMED
7223-90845-0009 NOW WHILE THE HUNTER WAS FILLING HIS POCKETS THE FLASH OF A JEWEL LYING ON THE FLOOR HAPPENED TO CATCH HIS EYE AND LOOKING DOWN HE SAW THAT A KIND OF TRAIL OF JEWELS LAY ALONG THE FLOOR LEADING OUT OF THE ROOM
7223-90845-0010 FOLLOWING THE SCATTERED GEMS WHICH HAD THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING BEEN SPILLED FROM SOME TREASURE CASKET HEAPED TOO HIGH THE HUNTER CAME TO A LOW DOOR AND OPENING THIS DOOR
7223-90845-0011 HE DISCOVERED A FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS LEADING TO THE TURRET THE STEPS WERE STREWN CARELESSLY WITH THE FINEST EMERALDS TOPAZES BERYLS MOONSTONES RUBIES AND CRYSTAL DIAMONDS
7223-90845-0012 REMEMBERING THE COUNSEL OF HIS FRIEND THE DWARF HOWEVER THE HUNTER DID NOT GO UP THE STAIRS BUT HURRIED HOME WITH HIS TREASURE WHEN THE HUNTER RETURNED TO HIS COUNTRY
7223-90845-0013 THE WONDERFUL TREASURES WHICH HE HAD TAKEN FROM THE CASTLE IN THE WOOD MADE HIM A VERY RICH MAN AND IN A SHORT TIME THE NEWS OF HIS PROSPERITY CAME TO THE EARS OF THE KING THIS KING WAS THE WICKEDEST OF ROGUES
7223-90845-0014 AND HIS TWO BEST FRIENDS THE CHAMBERLAIN AND THE CHANCELLOR WERE EVERY BIT AS UNSCRUPULOUS AS HE THEY OPPRESSED THE PEOPLE WITH TAXES THEY STOLE FROM THE POOR THEY ROBBED THE CHURCHES
7223-90845-0015 INDEED THERE WAS NO INJUSTICE WHICH THEY WERE NOT READY TO COMMIT SO WHEN THE CHAMBERLAIN HEARD OF THE HUNTER'S WEALTH HE BEING A DIRECT STRAIGHTFORWARD RASCAL DECLARED THAT THE SIMPLEST THING TO DO
7223-90845-0016 WOULD BE TO KILL THE HUNTER AND TAKE HIS MONEY THE CHANCELLOR WHO WAS SOMEWHAT MORE CUNNING AND WORLDLY DECLARED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO THROW THE HUNTER INTO A FOUL DARK DUNGEON
7223-90845-0017 TILL HE WAS READY TO BUY HIS FREEDOM WITH ALL HIS WEALTH THE KING WHO WAS THE WICKEDEST AND WISEST OF THE PRECIOUS THREE DECLARED THAT THE BEST THING TO DO WAS TO FIND OUT WHENCE THE HUNTER HAD GOT HIS TREASURE
7223-90845-0018 SO THAT IF THERE HAPPENED TO BE ANY LEFT THEY COULD GO AND GET IT THEN OF COURSE THEY COULD KILL THE HUNTER AND TAKE HIS TREASURE TOO THUS IT CAME TO PASS THAT BY A ROYAL ORDER
7223-90845-0019 THE HUNTER WAS THROWN INTO A HORRIBLE PRISON AND TOLD THAT HIS ONLY HOPE OF RELEASE LAY IN REVEALING THE ORIGIN OF HIS RICHES SO AFTER HE HAD BEEN SLOWLY STARVED AND CRUELLY BEATEN
7223-90845-0020 HE TOLD OF THE TREASURE CASTLE IN THE WOOD ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE KING THE CHAMBERLAIN AND THE CHANCELLOR TAKING WITH THEM SOME STRONG LINEN BAGS AND SOME PACK MULES RODE FORTH IN QUEST OF THE TREASURE
7223-90845-0021 GREAT WAS THEIR JOY WHEN THEY FOUND THE TREASURE CASTLE AND THE TREASURE ROOM JUST AS THE HUNTER HAD DESCRIBED THE CHANCELLOR POURED THE SHINING GEMS THROUGH HIS CLAW LIKE FINGERS AND THE KING AND THE CHAMBERLAIN
7223-90845-0022 THREW THEIR ARMS AROUND EACH OTHERS SHOULDERS AND DANCED A JIG AS WELL AS THEIR AGE AND DIGNITY WOULD PERMIT THE FIRST FINE CARELESS RAPTURE OVER THEY BEGAN POURING THE TREASURE INTO THE LINEN SACKS THEY HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM
7223-90845-0023 AND THESE FILLED TO THE BRIM THEY CARRIED TO THE CASTLE DOOR SOON NOT THE TINIEST GEM WAS LEFT ON THE TABLE SUDDENLY
7223-90845-0024 THE CHAMBERLAIN HAPPENED TO CATCH SIGHT OF THE GEMS STREWN ALONG THE FLOOR SEE SEE HE CRIED HIS VOICE SHRILL AND GREEDY THERE IS YET MORE TO BE HAD SO THE THREE ROGUES
7223-90845-0025 GOT DOWN ON THEIR HANDS AND KNEES AND BEGAN STUFFING THE STRAY JEWELS INTO THEIR BULGING POCKETS THE TRAIL OF JEWELS LED THEM ACROSS THE HALL TO THE LITTLE DOOR OPENING ON THE STAIRWAY AND UP THIS STAIRWAY
7223-90845-0026 IN THE TURRET THEY FOUND ANOTHER ROUND ROOM LIT BY THREE NARROW BARRED WINDOWS AND IN THE CENTRE OF THIS TURRET CHAMBER LIKEWISE LADEN WITH GOLD AND JEWELS
7223-90845-0027 THEY FOUND ANOTHER EBONY TABLE WITH SHRIEKS OF DELIGHT THE KING AND THE CHANCELLOR AND THE CHAMBERLAIN RAN TO THIS SECOND TREASURE AND PLUNGED THEIR HANDS IN THE GLITTERING GOLDEN MASS

7223-90845-0030 TOSSING THE TREASURE OVER THEM AND THEN WONDER OF WONDERS THE CASTLE TURRET WITH THE THREE ROGUES IMPRISONED IN IT DETACHED ITSELF FROM THE REST OF THE CASTLE
7223-90845-0031 AND FLEW OFF INTO THE AIR FROM THE BARRED WINDOWS THE KING THE CHAMBERLAIN AND THE CHANCELLOR SAW LEAGUE UPON LEAGUE OF THE FOREST RUSHING BY BENEATH THEM SUDDENLY
7223-90845-0032 THE FLYING ROOM BEGAN TO DESCEND SWIFTLY AND LANDED LIGHTLY AS A BIRD IN THE MIDDLE OF A CASTLE COURTYARD STRANGE LOOKING FELLOWS WITH HUMAN BODIES AND HEADS OF HORSES CAME RUSHING
7223-90845-0033 TOWARD THE ENCHANTED TURRET AND SEIZED ITS PRISONERS IN A FEW MOMENTS THEY WERE BROUGHT BEFORE THE KING TO WHOM THE TREASURE BELONGED NOW THIS KING WAS A BROTHER OF THE DWARF
7223-90845-0034 WHOM THE HUNTER HAD RESCUED FROM THE PIT HE HAD A LITTLE GOLD CROWN ON HIS HEAD AND SAT ON A LITTLE GOLDEN THRONE WITH CUSHIONS OF CRIMSON VELVET
