5029-30593-0000 MISSUS SEFTON NODDED ABSTRACTEDLY ABOVE HER FANCYWORK THAT IS IT IS A VERY COMMONPLACE STORY INDEED I DON'T BELIEVE THE SPIRITS OF THE DEPARTED TROUBLE THEMSELVES TO REVISIT THE GLIMPSES OF THE MOON
5029-30593-0001 SURELY MARY I EXCLAIMED YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU BELIEVE PEOPLE EVER DO OR CAN SEE SPIRITS GHOSTS AS THE WORD GOES
5029-30593-0002 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING OF THE SORT I NEITHER BELIEVE NOR DISBELIEVE BUT YOU KNOW QUEER THINGS DO HAPPEN AT TIMES THINGS YOU CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR AT LEAST PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW WOULDN'T LIE SAY SO
5029-30593-0003 IN FACT I THINK VERY FEW OF US HAVE I DARE SAY YOU THINK I'M TALKING NONSENSE WELL YES I THINK YOU ARE YOU REALLY SURPRISE ME MARY
5029-30593-0004 SOMETHING MUST HAVE COME UNDER YOUR OBSERVATION TO DEVELOP SUCH THEORIES IN YOUR PRACTICAL HEAD TELL ME WHAT IT WAS TO WHAT PURPOSE YOU WOULD REMAIN AS SCEPTICAL AS EVER POSSIBLY NOT TRY ME I MAY BE CONVINCED
5029-30593-0005 NO RETURNED MISSUS SEFTON CALMLY
5029-30593-0006 THAT IS MY POSITION BUT BY THE TIME IT GETS TO THE THIRD PERSON THE OUTSIDER IT LOSES POWER BESIDES IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE THE STORY ISN'T VERY EXCITING
5029-30593-0007 IT'S TRUE YOU HAVE EXCITED MY CURIOSITY YOU MUST TELL ME THE STORY WELL FIRST TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS SUPPOSE TWO PEOPLE BOTH SENSITIVELY ORGANIZED INDIVIDUALS
5029-30593-0008 LOVED EACH OTHER WITH A LOVE STRONGER THAN LIFE IF THEY WERE APART DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE FOR THEIR SOULS TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER IN SOME INEXPLICABLE WAY AND IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO ONE
5029-30593-0009 YOU'RE GETTING INTO TOO DEEP WATERS FOR ME MARY I SAID SHAKING MY HEAD I'M NOT AN AUTHORITY ON TELEPATHY OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT BUT I'VE NO BELIEF IN SUCH THEORIES IN FACT I THINK THEY ARE ALL NONSENSE
5029-30593-0010 I'M SURE YOU MUST THINK SO TOO IN YOUR RATIONAL MOMENTS I DARE SAY IT IS ALL NONSENSE SAID MISSUS SEFTON SLOWLY BUT IF YOU HAD LIVED A WHOLE YEAR IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH MIRIAM GORDON
5029-30593-0011 YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN TAINTED TOO NOT THAT SHE HAD THEORIES' AT LEAST SHE NEVER AIRED THEM IF SHE HAD BUT THERE WAS SIMPLY SOMETHING ABOUT THE GIRL HERSELF THAT GAVE A PERSON STRANGE IMPRESSIONS
5029-30593-0012 WHEN I FIRST MET HER I HAD THE MOST UNCANNY FEELING THAT SHE WAS ALL SPIRIT SOUL WHAT YOU WILL NO FLESH ANYHOW THAT FEELING WORE OFF AFTER A WHILE BUT SHE NEVER SEEMED LIKE OTHER PEOPLE TO ME
5029-30593-0013 SHE WAS MISTER SEFTON'S NIECE HER FATHER HAD DIED WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD WHEN MIRIAM WAS TWENTY HER MOTHER HAD MARRIED A SECOND TIME AND WENT TO EUROPE WITH HER HUSBAND MIRIAM CAME TO LIVE WITH US WHILE THEY WERE AWAY
5029-30593-0014 AND I WAS ABSENT FROM HOME WHEN SHE CAME I RETURNED IN THE EVENING AND WHEN I SAW HER FIRST SHE WAS STANDING UNDER THE CHANDELIER IN THE DRAWING ROOM TALK ABOUT SPIRITS FOR FIVE SECONDS I THOUGHT I HAD SEEN ONE
5029-30593-0015 MIRIAM WAS A BEAUTY I HAD KNOWN THAT BEFORE THOUGH I THINK I HARDLY EXPECTED TO SEE SUCH WONDERFUL LOVELINESS SHE WAS TALL AND EXTREMELY GRACEFUL
5029-30593-0016 DARK AT LEAST HER HAIR WAS DARK BUT HER SKIN WAS WONDERFULLY FAIR AND CLEAR HER HAIR WAS GATHERED AWAY FROM HER FACE AND SHE HAD A HIGH PURE WHITE FOREHEAD AND THE STRAIGHTEST FINEST BLACKEST BROWS
5029-30593-0017 HER FACE WAS OVAL WITH VERY LARGE AND DARK EYES I SOON REALIZED THAT MIRIAM WAS IN SOME MYSTERIOUS FASHION DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PEOPLE
5029-30593-0018 I THINK EVERYONE WHO MET HER FELT THE SAME WAY YET IT WAS A FEELING HARD TO DEFINE FOR MY OWN PART I SIMPLY FELT AS IF SHE BELONGED TO ANOTHER WORLD AND THAT PART OF THE TIME SHE HER SOUL YOU KNOW
5029-30593-0019 WAS BACK THERE AGAIN YOU MUST NOT SUPPOSE THAT MIRIAM WAS A DISAGREEABLE PERSON TO HAVE IN THE HOUSE ON THE CONTRARY IT WAS THE VERY REVERSE EVERYBODY LIKED HER
5029-30593-0020 SHE WAS ONE OF THE SWEETEST MOST WINSOME GIRLS I EVER KNEW AND I SOON GREW TO LOVE HER DEARLY AS FOR WHAT DICK CALLED HER LITTLE QUEERNESSES'
5029-30593-0021 MIRIAM WAS ENGAGED AS I HAVE TOLD YOU TO A YOUNG HARVARD MAN NAMED SIDNEY CLAXTON I KNEW SHE LOVED HIM VERY DEEPLY WHEN SHE SHOWED ME HIS PHOTOGRAPH I LIKED HIS APPEARANCE AND SAID SO
5029-30593-0022 THEN I MADE SOME TEASING REMARK ABOUT HER LOVE LETTERS JUST FOR A JOKE YOU KNOW MIRIAM LOOKED AT ME WITH AN ODD LITTLE SMILE AND SAID QUICKLY SIDNEY AND I NEVER WRITE TO EACH OTHER WHY MIRIAM
5029-30593-0023 NO I DID NOT SAY THAT I HEAR FROM HIM EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR WE DO NOT NEED TO WRITE LETTERS THERE ARE BETTER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN TWO SOULS THAT ARE IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH EACH OTHER
5029-30593-0024 MIRIAM YOU UNCANNY CREATURE WHAT DO YOU MEAN I ASKED BUT MIRIAM ONLY GAVE ANOTHER QUEER SMILE AND MADE NO ANSWER AT ALL WHATEVER HER BELIEFS OR THEORIES WERE SHE WOULD NEVER DISCUSS THEM
5029-30593-0025 SHE HAD A HABIT OF DROPPING INTO ABSTRACTED REVERIES AT ANY TIME OR PLACE NO MATTER WHERE SHE WAS THIS WHATEVER IT WAS WOULD COME OVER HER SHE WOULD SIT THERE
5029-30593-0026 PERHAPS IN THE CENTRE OF A GAY CROWD AND GAZE RIGHT OUT INTO SPACE NOT HEARING OR SEEING A SINGLE THING THAT WENT ON AROUND HER I REMEMBER ONE DAY IN PARTICULAR WE WERE SEWING IN MY ROOM
5029-30593-0027 AND SHE WAS LEANING FORWARD HER LIPS APART HER EYES GAZING UPWARD WITH AN UNEARTHLY EXPRESSION
5029-30593-0028 MIRIAM CAME OUT OF HER TRANCE OR REVERIE AND SAID WITH A LITTLE LAUGH
5029-30593-0029 SHE BENT HER HEAD FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN SHE LIFTED IT AGAIN AND LOOKED AT ME WITH A SUDDEN CONTRACTION OF HER LEVEL BROWS THAT BETOKENED VEXATION I WISH YOU HADN'T SPOKEN TO ME JUST THEN SHE SAID
5029-30593-0030 YOU INTERRUPTED THE MESSAGE I WAS RECEIVING I SHALL NOT GET IT AT ALL NOW MIRIAM I IMPLORED I SO WISH MY DEAR GIRL THAT YOU WOULDN'T TALK SO
5029-30593-0031 SIDNEY SAID MIRIAM SIMPLY NONSENSE
5029-30593-0032 MIRIAM SAID NOTHING AT THE TIME BUT WHEN WE WERE ALONE I ASKED HER WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF IT I THOUGHT YOU WERE ALL MERELY TALKING AGAINST TIME SHE RETORTED EVASIVELY
5029-30593-0033 WELL SPIRITS THEN TO RETURN AFTER DEATH OR TO APPEAR TO ANYONE APART FROM THE FLESH
5029-30593-0034 IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO SIDNEY IF HE WERE TO DIE OR BE KILLED HE WOULD COME TO ME HIMSELF AND TELL ME ONE DAY MIRIAM CAME DOWN TO LUNCH LOOKING PALE AND WORRIED AFTER DICK WENT OUT
5029-30593-0035 I ASKED HER IF ANYTHING WERE WRONG SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO SIDNEY SHE REPLIED SOME PAINFUL ACCIDENT I DON'T KNOW WHAT
5029-30593-0036 THEN AS SHE LOOKED AT ME STRANGELY I ADDED HASTILY YOU HAVEN'T BEEN RECEIVING ANY MORE UNEARTHLY MESSAGES HAVE YOU
5029-30593-0037 THE FIRST I HAD EVER KNOWN HER TO RECEIVE IN WHICH HE SAID HE HAD BEEN THROWN FROM HIS HORSE AND HAD BROKEN HIS LEFT ARM IT HAD HAPPENED THE VERY MORNING MIRIAM RECEIVED HER MESSAGE
5029-30593-0038 WHEN ONE DAY SHE CAME INTO MY ROOM HURRIEDLY SHE WAS VERY PALE SIDNEY IS ILL DANGEROUSLY ILL WHAT SHALL I DO
5029-30593-0039 I KNEW SHE MUST HAVE HAD ANOTHER OF THOSE ABOMINABLE MESSAGES OR THOUGHT SHE HAD AND REALLY REMEMBERING THE INCIDENT OF THE BROKEN ARM I COULDN'T FEEL AS SCEPTICAL AS I PRETENDED TO I TRIED TO CHEER HER BUT DID NOT SUCCEED
5029-30593-0040 WAS THAT SHE RECEIVED NO MORE MESSAGES SHE SAID IT WAS BECAUSE SIDNEY WAS TOO ILL TO SEND THEM ANYHOW SHE HAD TO CONTENT HERSELF WITH THE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION USED BY ORDINARY MORTALS
5029-30593-0041 AND AT LAST GOOD NEWS CAME THE CRISIS WAS OVER AND THE DOCTOR IN ATTENDANCE THOUGHT SIDNEY WOULD RECOVER MIRIAM SEEMED LIKE A NEW CREATURE THEN AND RAPIDLY RECOVERED HER SPIRITS FOR A WEEK REPORTS CONTINUED FAVOURABLE
5029-30593-0042 ONE NIGHT WE WENT TO THE OPERA TO HEAR A CELEBRATED PRIMA DONNA WHEN WE RETURNED HOME MIRIAM AND I WERE SITTING IN HER ROOM CHATTING OVER THE EVENTS OF THE EVENING SUDDENLY SHE SAT STRAIGHT UP WITH A SORT OF CONVULSIVE SHUDDER
5029-30593-0043 AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU MAY LAUGH IF YOU LIKE
5029-30593-0044 RANG THE BELL AND RUSHED TO HER IN A FEW MINUTES THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD WAS AROUSED AND DICK WAS OFF POSTHASTE FOR THE DOCTOR FOR WE COULD NOT REVIVE MIRIAM FROM HER DEATH LIKE SWOON SHE SEEMED AS ONE DEAD
5029-30593-0045 WE WORKED OVER HER FOR HOURS SHE WOULD COME OUT OF HER FAINT FOR A MOMENT GIVE US AN UNKNOWING STARE AND GO SHUDDERINGLY OFF AGAIN THE DOCTOR TALKED OF SOME FEARFUL SHOCK BUT I KEPT MY OWN COUNSEL AT DAWN
5029-30593-0046 MIRIAM CAME BACK TO LIFE AT LAST WHEN SHE AND I WERE LEFT ALONE SHE TURNED TO ME SIDNEY IS DEAD SHE SAID QUIETLY I SAW HIM JUST BEFORE I FAINTED
5029-30593-0047 I LOOKED UP AND HE WAS STANDING BETWEEN ME AND YOU HE HAD COME TO SAY FAREWELL
5029-30593-0048 HE WAS DEAD HE HAD DIED AT THE VERY HOUR AT WHICH MIRIAM HAD SEEN HIM MISSUS SEFTON PAUSED AND THE LUNCH BELL RANG
