3092-39501-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE SEA AND ITS SHORES
3092-39501-0001 THE MANTLE OF ROCK WASTE CREEPING DOWN SLOPES IS WASHED TO THE SEA BY STREAMS TOGETHER WITH THE MATERIAL WHICH THE STREAMS HAVE WORN FROM THEIR BEDS AND THAT DISSOLVED BY UNDERGROUND WATERS
3092-39501-0002 OR LEAVE IT FOR STREAMS TO TRANSPORT TO THE SAME GOAL ALL DEPOSITS MADE ON THE LAND SUCH AS THE FLOOD PLAINS OF RIVERS THE SILTS OF LAKE BEDS DUNE SANDS AND SHEETS OF GLACIAL DRIFT
3092-39501-0003 MARK BUT PAUSES IN THE PROCESS WHICH IS TO BRING ALL THE MATERIALS OF THE LAND NOW ABOVE SEA LEVEL TO REST UPON THE OCEAN BED
3092-39501-0004 AS AN AGENT OF DESTRUCTION AND WE MUST FIRST TAKE UP ITS WORK IN EROSION BEFORE WE CONSIDER HOW IT TRANSPORTS AND DEPOSITS THE WASTE OF THE LAND SEA EROSION THE SEA CLIFF AND THE ROCK BENCH
3092-39501-0005 ON MANY COASTS THE LAND FRONTS THE OCEAN IN A LINE OF CLIFFS TO THE EDGE OF THE CLIFFS THERE LEAD DOWN VALLEYS AND RIDGES CARVED BY RUNNING WATER WHICH IF EXTENDED
3092-39501-0006 MORE OR LESS THICKLY VENEERED WITH SAND AND SHINGLE AT LOW TIDE ITS INNER MARGIN IS LAID BARE BUT AT HIGH TIDE IT IS COVERED WHOLLY AND THE SEA WASHES THE BASE OF THE CLIFFS A NOTCH OF WHICH THE SEA CLIFF
3092-39501-0007 AND THE ROCK BENCH ARE THE TWO SIDES HAS BEEN CUT ALONG THE SHORE WAVES
3092-39501-0008 WITH ITS INNER MARGIN SLIGHTLY ABOVE LOW TIDE SHOWS THAT IT HAS BEEN CUT BY SOME AGENT WHICH ACTS LIKE A HORIZONTAL SAW SET AT ABOUT SEA LEVEL THIS AGENT IS CLEARLY THE SURFACE AGITATION OF THE WATER
3092-39501-0009 ON THE COAST OF SCOTLAND THE FORCE OF THE BLOWS STRUCK BY THE WAVES OF THE HEAVIEST STORMS HAS SOMETIMES EXCEEDED THREE TONS TO THE SQUARE FOOT BUT EVEN A CALM SEA CONSTANTLY CHAFES THE SHORE
3092-39501-0010 ELSE THEY WOULD HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON CLIFFS OF SOLID ROCK STORM WAVES ARM THEMSELVES WITH THE SAND AND GRAVEL THE COBBLES AND EVEN THE LARGE BOWLDERS WHICH LIE AT THE BASE OF THE CLIFF AND BEAT AGAINST IT WITH THESE HAMMERS
3092-39501-0011 UNTIL THE TALUS FALLEN FROM THE CLIFF IS GRADUALLY BUILT UP BENEATH THE SEA TO THE LEVEL AT WHICH THE WAVES DRAG BOTTOM UPON IT AND BREAK
3092-39501-0012 RUNNING WATER SWEEPS FRAGMENTS OF VARIOUS SIZES ALONG ITS CHANNELS HOLDING THEM WITH A LOOSE HAND GLACIAL ICE GRINDS THE STONES OF ITS GROUND MORAINE AGAINST THE UNDERLYING ROCK
3092-39501-0013 WEATHERING OF SEA CLIFFS THE SEA CLIFF FURNISHES THE WEAPONS FOR ITS OWN DESTRUCTION THEY ARE BROKEN FROM IT NOT ONLY BY THE WAVE BUT ALSO BY THE WEATHER INDEED
3092-39501-0014 THE SEA CLIFF WEATHERS MORE RAPIDLY AS A RULE THAN DO ROCK LEDGES INLAND IT IS ABUNDANTLY WET WITH SPRAY ALONG ITS BASE THE GROUND WATER OF THE NEIGHBORING LAND FINDS ITS NATURAL OUTLET IN SPRINGS WHICH UNDER MINE IT
3092-39501-0015 MOREOVER IT IS UNPROTECTED BY ANY SHIELD OF TALUS FRAGMENTS OF ROCK AS THEY FALL FROM ITS FACE ARE BATTERED TO PIECES BY THE WAVES AND SWEPT OUT TO SEA THE CLIFF IS THUS LEFT EXPOSED TO THE ATTACK OF THE WEATHER
3092-39501-0016 AND ITS RETREAT WOULD BE COMPARATIVELY RAPID FOR THIS REASON ALONE SEA CLIFFS SELDOM OVERHANG BUT COMMONLY AS IN FIGURE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR SLOPE SEAWARD
3092-39501-0017 SHOWING THAT THE UPPER PORTION HAS RETREATED AT A MORE RAPID RATE THAN HAS THE BASE WHICH DO YOU INFER IS ON THE WHOLE THE MORE DESTRUCTIVE AGENT WEATHERING OR THE WAVE DRAW A SECTION OF A SEA CLIFF CUT IN WELL JOINTED ROCKS
3092-39501-0018 WHOSE JOINTS DIP TOWARD THE LAND DRAW A DIAGRAM OF A SEA CLIFF WHERE THE JOINTS DIP TOWARD THE SEA SEA CAVES THE WAVE DOES NOT MERELY BATTER THE FACE OF THE CLIFF
3092-39501-0019 LIKE A SKILLFUL QUARRYMAN IT INSERTS WEDGES IN ALL NATURAL FISSURES SUCH AS JOINTS AND USES EXPLOSIVE FORCES AS A WAVE FLAPS AGAINST A CREVICE IT COMPRESSES THE AIR WITHIN WITH THE SUDDEN STROKE
3092-39501-0020 AS IT FALLS BACK THE AIR AS SUDDENLY EXPANDS ON LIGHTHOUSES HEAVILY BARRED DOORS HAVE BEEN BURST OUTWARD BY THE EXPLOSIVE FORCE OF THE AIR WITHIN
3092-39501-0021 AS IT WAS RELEASED FROM PRESSURE WHEN A PARTIAL VACUUM WAS FORMED BY THE REFLUENCE OF THE WAVE WHERE A CREVICE IS FILLED WITH WATER THE ENTIRE FORCE OF THE BLOW OF THE WAVE IS TRANSMITTED BY HYDRAULIC PRESSURE TO THE SIDES OF THE FISSURE
3092-39501-0022 THUS STORM WAVES LITTLE BY LITTLE PRY AND SUCK THE ROCK LOOSE AND IN THIS WAY AND BY THE BLOWS WHICH THEY STRIKE WITH THE STONES OF THE BEACH THEY QUARRY OUT ABOUT A JOINT OR WHEREVER THE ROCK MAY BE WEAK A RECESS KNOWN AS A SEA CAVE
3092-39501-0023 PROVIDED THAT THE ROCK ABOVE IS COHERENT ENOUGH TO FORM A ROOF OTHERWISE AN OPEN CHASM RESULTS BLOWHOLES AND SEA ARCHES
3092-39501-0024 AS A SEA CAVE IS DRILLED BACK INTO THE ROCK IT MAY ENCOUNTER A JOINT OR CREVICE OPENED TO THE SURFACE BY PERCOLATING WATER THE SHOCK OF THE WAVES SOON ENLARGES THIS TO A BLOWHOLE WHICH ONE MAY FIND ON THE BREEZY UPLAND
3092-39501-0025 PERHAPS A HUNDRED YARDS AND MORE BACK FROM THE CLIFF'S EDGE IN QUIET WEATHER THE BLOWHOLE IS A DEEP WELL IN STORM IT PLAYS A FOUNTAIN AS THE WAVES DRIVE THROUGH THE LONG TUNNEL BELOW AND SPOUT THEIR SPRAY HIGH IN AIR IN SUCCESSIVE JETS
3092-39501-0026 AS THE ROOF OF THE CAVE THUS BREAKS DOWN IN THE REAR THERE MAY REMAIN IN FRONT FOR A WHILE A SEA ARCH SIMILAR TO THE NATURAL BRIDGES OF LAND CAVERNS STACKS AND WAVE CUT ISLANDS
3092-39501-0027 AS THE SEA DRIVES ITS TUNNELS AND OPEN DRIFTS INTO THE CLIFF IT BREAKS THROUGH BEHIND THE INTERVENING PORTIONS AND LEAVES THEM ISOLATED AS STACKS MUCH AS MONUMENTS ARE DETACHED FROM INLAND ESCARPMENTS BY THE WEATHER
3092-39501-0028 AND AS THE SEA CLIFF RETREATS THESE REMNANT MASSES MAY BE LEFT BEHIND AS ROCKY ISLETS THUS THE ROCK BENCH IS OFTEN SET WITH STACKS ISLETS IN ALL STAGES OF DESTRUCTION AND SUNKEN REEFS
3092-39501-0029 ALL WRECKS OF THE LAND TESTIFYING TO ITS RETREAT BEFORE THE INCESSANT ATTACK OF THE WAVES COVES WHERE ZONES OF SOFT OR CLOSELY JOINTED ROCK OUTCROP ALONG A SHORE
3092-39501-0030 OR WHERE MINOR WATER COURSES CONIC DOWN TO THE SEA AND AID IN EROSION THE SHORE IS WORN BACK IN CURVED REENTRANTS CALLED COVES WHILE THE MORE RESISTANT ROCKS ON EITHER HAND ARE LEFT PROJECTING AS HEADLANDS
3092-39501-0031 AFTER COVES ARE CUT BACK A SHORT DISTANCE BY THE WAVES THE HEADLANDS COME TO PROTECT THEM AS WITH BREAKWATERS AND PREVENT THEIR INDEFINITE RETREAT THE SHORE TAKES A CURVE OF EQUILIBRIUM
3092-39501-0032 THE RATE AT WHICH A SHORE RECEDES DEPENDS ON SEVERAL FACTORS IN SOFT OR INCOHERENT ROCKS EXPOSED TO VIOLENT STORMS THE RETREAT IS SO RAPID AS TO BE EASILY MEASURED THE COAST OF YORKSHIRE ENGLAND
3092-39501-0033 THE SANDY SOUTH SHORE OF MARTHA'S VINEYARD WEARS BACK THREE FEET A YEAR BUT HARD ROCKS RETREAT SO SLOWLY THAT THEIR RECESSION HAS SELDOM BEEN MEASURED BY THE RECORDS OF HISTORY
3092-39501-0034 SHORE DRIFT BOWLDER AND PEBBLE BEACHES ABOUT AS FAST AS FORMED THE WASTE OF THE SEA CLIFF IS SWEPT BOTH ALONG THE SHORE AND OUT TO SEA
3092-39501-0035 THE ROAD OF WASTE ALONG SHORE IS THE BEACH WE MAY ALSO DEFINE THE BEACH AS THE EXPOSED EDGE OF THE SHEET OF SEDIMENT FORMED BY THE CARRIAGE OF LAND WASTE OUT TO SEA
3092-39501-0036 AT THE FOOT OF SEA CLIFFS WHERE THE WAVES ARE POUNDING HARDEST ONE COMMONLY FINDS THE ROCK BENCH STREWN ON ITS INNER MARGIN WITH LARGE STONES DISLODGED BY THE WAVES AND BY THE WEATHER
3092-39501-0037 MADE OF PEBBLES WELL ROUNDED BY THE WEAR WHICH THEY HAVE SUFFERED SUCH BEACHES FORM A MILL WHOSE RAW MATERIAL IS CONSTANTLY SUPPLIED BY THE CLIFF THE BREAKERS OF STORMS SET IT IN MOTION TO A DEPTH OF SEVERAL FEET
3092-39501-0038 GRINDING THE PEBBLES TOGETHER WITH A CLATTER TO BE HEARD ABOVE THE ROAR OF THE SURF IN SUCH A ROCK CRUSHER THE LIFE OF A PEBBLE IS SHORT WHERE SHIPS HAVE STRANDED ON OUR ATLANTIC COAST WITH CARGOES OF HARD BURNED BRICK OR OF COAL
3092-39501-0039 AT NO GREAT DISTANCE FROM THEIR SOURCE THEREFORE PEBBLE BEACHES GIVE PLACE TO BEACHES OF SAND WHICH OCCUPY THE MORE SHELTERED REACHES OF THE SHORE SAND BEACHES
3092-39501-0040 THE ANGULAR SAND GRAINS OF VARIOUS MINERALS INTO WHICH PEBBLES ARE BROKEN BY THE WAVES ARE GROUND TOGETHER UNDER THE BEATING SURF AND ROUNDED AND THOSE OF THE SOFTER MINERALS ARE CRUSHED TO POWDER
3092-39501-0041 THE PROCESS HOWEVER IS A SLOW ONE AND IF WE STUDY THESE SAND GRAINS UNDER A LENS WE MAY BE SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THOUGH THEIR CORNERS AND EDGES HAVE BEEN BLUNTED THEY ARE YET FAR FROM THE SPHERICAL FORM OF THE PEBBLES FROM WHICH THEY WERE DERIVED
3092-39501-0042 THE GRAINS ARE SMALL AND IN WATER THEY HAVE LOST ABOUT HALF THEIR WEIGLIT IN AIR THE BLOWS WHICH THEY STRIKE ONE ANOTHER ARE THEREFORE WEAK BESIDES EACH GRAIN OF SAND OF THE WET BEACH IS PROTECTED BY A CUSHION OF WATER FROM THE BLOWS OF ITS NEIGHBORS
3092-39501-0043 GIVE A ROUGH MEASURE OF THE DISTANCE IN SPACE AND TIME WHICH THEY HAVE TRAVELED FROM THEIR SOURCE THE SAND OF MANY BEACHES DERIVED FROM THE ROCKS OF ADJACENT CLIFFS OR BROUGHT IN BY TORRENTIAL STREAMS FROM NEIGHBORING HIGHLANDS
3092-39501-0044 IS DARK WITH GRAINS OF A NUMBER OF MINERALS SOFTER THAN QUARTZ THE WHITE SAND OF OTHER BEACHES AS THOSE OF THE EAST COAST OF FLORIDA IS ALMOST WHOLLY COMPOSED OF QUARTZ GRAINS
3092-39501-0045 HOW SHORE DRIFT MIGRATES IT IS UNDER THE ACTION OF WAVES AND CURRENTS THAT SHORE DRIFT MIGRATES SLOWLY ALONG A COAST WHERE WAVES STRIKE A COAST OBLIQUELY
3092-39501-0046 THEY DRIVE THE WASTE BEFORE THEM LITTLE BY LITTLE ALONG THE SHORE THUS ON A NORTH SOUTH COAST WHERE THE PREDOMINANT STORMS ARE FROM THE NORTHEAST THERE WILL BE A MIGRATION OF SHORE DRIFT SOUTHWARDS
3092-39501-0047 ALL SHORES ARE SWEPT ALSO BY CURRENTS PRODUCED BY WINDS AND TIDES THESE ARE USUALLY FAR TOO GENTLE TO TRANSPORT OF THEMSELVES THE COARSE MATERIALS OF WHICH BEACHES ARE MADE
3092-39501-0048 THE CURRENT CARRIES THEM A STEP FORWARD ON THEIR WAY THE CURRENT CANNOT LIFT AND THE WAVE CANNOT CARRY BUT TOGETHER THE TWO TRANSPORT THE WASTE ALONG THE SHORE THE ROAD OF SHORE DRIFT IS THEREFORE THE ZONE
3092-39501-0049 OF THE BREAKING WAVES THE BAY HEAD BEACH AS THE WASTE DERIVED FROM THE WEAR OF WAVES AND THAT BROUGHT IN BY STREAMS IS TRAILED ALONG A COAST IT ASSUMES UNDER VARYING CONDITIONS A NUMBER OF DISTINCT FORMS
3092-39501-0050 WHEN SWEPT INTO THE HEAD OF A SHELTERED BAY IT CONSTITUTES THE BAY HEAD BEACH BY THE HIGHEST STORM WAVES THE BEACH IS OFTEN BUILT HIGHER THAN THE GROUND IMMEDIATELY BEHIND IT AND FORMS A DAM
3092-39501-0051 INCLOSING A SHALLOW POND OR MARSH THE BAY BAR AS THE STREAM OF SHORE DRIFT REACHES THE MOUTH OF A BAY OF SOME SIZE IT OFTEN OCCURS
3092-39501-0052 THAT INSTEAD OF TURNING IN IT SETS DIRECTLY ACROSS TOWARD THE OPPOSITE HEADLAND THE WASTE IS CARRIED OUT FROM SHORE INTO THE DEEPER WATERS OF THE BAY MOUTH WHERE IT IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED BY THE BREAKING WAVES AND SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
3092-39501-0053 THE DUMP IS GRADUALLY BUILT TO THE SURFACE AS A STUBBY SPUR POINTING ACROSS THE BAY AND AS IT REACHES THE ZONE OF WAVE ACTION CURRENT AND WAVE CAN NOW COMBINE TO CARRY SHORE DRIFT ALONG IT
3092-39501-0054 DEPOSITING THEIR LOAD CONTINUALLY AT THE POINT OF THE SPUR AN EMBANKMENT IS THUS CONSTRUCTED IN MUCH THE SAME MANNER AS A RAILWAY FILL WHICH WHILE IT IS BUILDING SERVES AS A ROADWAY ALONG WHICH THE DIRT FROM AN ADJACENT CUT IS CARTED
3092-39501-0055 TO BE DUMPED AT THE END WHEN THE EMBANKMENT IS COMPLETED IT BRIDGES THE BAY WITH A HIGHWAY ALONG WHICH SHORE DRIFT NOW MOVES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION AND BECOMES A BAY BAR INCOMPLETE BAY BARS
3092-39501-0056 UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS THE SEA CANNOT CARRY OUT ITS INTENTION TO BRIDGE A BAY RIVERS DISCHARGING IN BAYS DEMAND OPEN WAY TO THE OCEAN STRONG TIDAL CURRENTS
3092-39501-0057 ALSO ARE ABLE TO KEEP OPEN CHANNELS SCOURED BY THEIR EBB AND FLOW IN SUCH CASES THE MOST THAT LAND WASTE CAN DO IS TO BUILD SPITS AND SHOALS NARROWING AND SHOALING THE CHANNEL AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
3092-39501-0058 SAND REEFS ON LOW COASTS WHERE SHALLOW WATER EXTENDS SOME DISTANCE OUT THE HIGHWAY OF SHORE DRIFT LIES ALONG A LOW NARROW RIDGE
3092-39501-0059 TERMED THE SAND REEF SEPARATED FROM THE LAND BY A NARROW STRETCH OF SHALLOW WATER CALLED THE LAGOON AT INTERVALS THE REEF IS HELD OPEN BY INLETS GAPS THROUGH WHICH THE TIDE FLOWS AND EBBS
3092-39501-0060 AND BY WHICH THE WATER OF STREAMS FINDS WAY TO THE SEA NO FINER EXAMPLE OF THIS KIND OF SHORE LINE IS TO BE FOUND IN THE WORLD THAN THE COAST OF TEXAS FROM NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE RIO GRANDE A
3092-39501-0061 DRAWS ITS EVEN CURVE FOR A HUNDRED MILES TO CORPUS CHRISTI PASS AND THE REEFS ARE BUT SELDOM INTERRUPTED BY INLETS AS FAR NORTH AS GALVESTON HARBOR ON THIS COAST THE TIDES ARE VARIABLE AND EXCEPTIONALLY WEAK
3092-39501-0062 BEING LESS THAN ONE FOOT IN HEIGHT WHILE THE AMOUNT OF WASTE SWEPT ALONG THE SHORE IS LARGE THE LAGOON IS EXTREMELY SHALLOW AND MUCH OF IT IS A MUD FLAT TOO SHOAL FOR EVEN SMALL BOATS
3092-39501-0063 ON THE COAST OF NEW JERSEY STRONG TIDES ARE ABLE TO KEEP OPEN INLETS AT INTERVALS OF FROM TWO TO TWENTY MILES IN SPITE OF A HEAVY ALONGSHORE DRIFT SAND REEFS ARE FORMED WHERE THE WATER IS SO SHALLOW NEAR SHORE
3092-39501-0064 WHERE STORM WAVES FIRST DRAG BOTTOM THEY ERODE AND DEEPEN THE SEA FLOOR AND SWEEP IN SEDIMENT AS FAR AS THE LINE WHERE THEY BREAK HERE WHERE THEY LOSE THEIR FORCE THEY DROP THEIR LOAD AND BEAT UP THE RIDGE WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE SAND REEF WHEN IT REACHES THE SURFACE
3092-39501-0065 SHORES OF ELEVATION AND DEPRESSION OUR STUDIES HAVE ALREADY BROUGHT TO OUR NOTICE TWO DISTINCT FORMS OF STRAND LINES ONE THE HIGH ROCKY COAST CUT BACK TO CLIFFS BY THE ATTACK OF THE WAVES
3092-39501-0066 AND THE OTHER THE LOW SANDY COAST WHERE THE WAVES BREAK USUALLY UPON THE SAND REEF TO UNDERSTAND THE ORIGIN OF THESE TWO TYPES WE MUST KNOW THAT THE MEETING PLACE OF SEA AND LAND IS DETERMINED PRIMARILY BY MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH'S CRUST
3092-39501-0067 WHERE A COAST LAND EMERGES THE SHORE LINE MOVES SEAWARD WHERE IT IS BEING SUBMERGED THE SHORE LINE ADVANCES ON THE LAND SHORES OF ELEVATION THE RETREAT OF THE SEA
3092-39501-0068 EITHER BECAUSE OF A LOCAL UPLIFT OF THE LAND OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON SUCH AS THE LOWERING OF ANY PORTION OF OCEAN BOTTOM LAYS BARE THE INNER MARGIN OF THE SEA FLOOR
3092-39501-0069 SUBAQUEOUS PLAIN GENTLY SHELVING FROM THE LAND SINCE THE NEW SHORE LINE IS DRAWN ACROSS THIS EVEN SURFACE IT IS SIMPLE AND REGULAR
3092-39501-0070 AND IS BORDERED ON THE ONE SIDE BY SHALLOW WATER GRADUALLY DEEPENING SEAWARD AND ON THE OTHER BY LOW LAND COMPOSED OF MATERIAL WHICH HAS NOT YET THOROUGHLY CONSOLIDATED TO FIRM ROCK
3092-39501-0071 A SAND REEF IS SOON BEATEN UP BY THE WAVES AND FOR SOME TIME CONDITIONS WILL FAVOR ITS GROWTH THE LOSS OF SAND DRIVEN INTO THE LAGOON BEYOND AND OF THAT GROUND TO POWDER BY THE SURF AND CARRIED OUT TO SEA
3092-39501-0072 AND ESPECIALLY BY THE DRAG OF SEDIMENTS TO THE REEF BY THE WAVES AS THEY DEEPEN THE SEA FLOOR ON ITS SEAWARD SIDE MEANWHILE THE LAGOON GRADUALLY FILLS WITH WASTE FROM THE REEF AND FROM THE LAND
3092-39501-0073 AND BECOMES A MEADOW SOLDERING THE SAND REEF TO THE MAINLAND WHILE THE LAGOON HAS BEEN FILLING THE WAVES HAVE BEEN SO DEEPENING THE SEA FLOOR OFF THE SAND REEF
3092-39501-0074 VIGOROUSLY THEY NOW WEAR IT BACK AND DRIVING THE SHORE LINE ACROSS THE LAGOON OR MEADOW CUT A LINE OF LOW CLIFFS ON THE MAINLAND SUCH A SHORE IS THAT OF GASCONY IN SOUTHWESTERN FRANCE
3092-39501-0075 AND THE VIGOROUS AND UNIMPEDED ATTACK BY THE SEA UPON THE MAINLAND INDICATE THE STAGE OF MATURITY
3092-39501-0076 MUCH WASTE IS BROUGHT IN BY RIVERS THE MATURITY OF SUCH A COAST MAY BE LONG DELAYED THE WASTE FROM THE LAND KEEPS THE SEA SHALLOW OFFSHORE AND CONSTANTLY RENEWS THE SAND REEF THE ENERGY OF THE WAVES IS CONSUMED IN HANDLING SHORE DRIFT
3092-39501-0077 AND NO ENERGY IS LEFT FOR AN EFFECTIVE ATTACK UPON THE LAND INDEED WITH AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF WASTE BROUGHT DOWN BY STREAMS THE LAND MAY BE BUILT OUT AND ENCROACH TEMPORARILY UPON THE SEA AND NOT UNTIL LONG DENUDATION HAS LOWERED THE LAND
3092-39501-0078 AND THUS DECREASED THE AMOUNT OF WASTE FROM IT MAY THE WAVES BE ABLE TO CUT THROUGH THE SAND REEF AND THUS THE COAST REACH MATURITY SHORES OF DEPRESSION
3092-39501-0079 WHERE A COASTAL REGION IS UNDERGOING SUBMERGENCE THE SHORE LINE MOVES LANDWARD THE HORIZONTAL PLANE OF THE SEA NOW INTERSECTS AN OLD LAND SURFACE ROUGHENED BY SUBAERIAL DENUDATION
3092-39501-0080 THE SHORE LINE IS IRREGULAR AND INDENTED IN PROPORTION TO THE RELIEF OF THE LAND AND THE AMOUNT OF THE SUBMERGENCE WHICH THE LAND HAS SUFFERED IT FOLLOWS UP PARTIALLY SUBMERGED VALLEYS FORMING BAYS
3092-39501-0081 AND BENDS ROUND THE DIVIDES LEAVING THEM TO PROJECT AS PROMONTORIES AND PENINSULAS THE OUTLINES OF SHORES OF DEPRESSION ARE AS VARIED AS ARE THE FORMS OF THE LAND PARTIALLY SUBMERGED WE GIVE A FEW TYPICAL ILLUSTRATIONS
3092-39501-0082 THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COAST OF MAINE ARE DUE CHIEFLY TO THE FACT THAT A MOUNTAINOUS REGION OF HARD ROCKS ONCE WORN TO A PENEPLAIN AND AFTER A SUBSEQUENT ELEVATION DEEPLY DISSECTED BY NORTH SOUTH VALLEYS HAS SUBSIDED
3092-39501-0083 THE DEPRESSION AMOUNTING ON ITS SOUTHERN MARGIN TO AS MUCH AS SIX HUNDRED FEET BELOW SEA LEVEL DROWNED VALLEYS PENETRATE THE LAND IN LONG NARROW BAYS AND RUGGED DIVIDES PROJECT IN LONG NARROW LAND ARMS
3092-39501-0084 PROLONGED SEAWARD BY ISLANDS REPRESENTING THE HIGH PORTIONS OF THEIR EXTREMITIES OF THIS EXCEEDINGLY RAGGED SHORE THERE ARE SAID TO BE TWO THOUSAND MILES FROM THE NEW BRUNSWICK BOUNDARY AS FAR WEST AS PORTLAND
3092-39501-0085 AND THE WASTE WITH WHICH THEIR FLOORS WERE STREWN IS NOW IN PART LAID BARE AS CLAY PLAINS ABOUT THE BAY HEADS AND IN NARROW SELVAGES ABOUT THE PENINSULAS AND ISLANDS THE COAST OF DALMATIA
3092-39501-0086 ON THE ADRIATIC SEA IS CHARACTERIZED BY LONG LAND ARMS AND CHAINS OF LONG AND NARROW ISLANDS ALL PARALLEL TO THE TREND OF THE COAST A REGION OF PARALLEL MOUNTAIN RANGES HAS BEEN DEPRESSED
3092-39501-0087 HUDSON BAY AND THE NORTH THE BALTIC AND THE YELLOW SEAS ARE EXAMPLES WHERE THE SINKING OF THE LAND HAS BROUGHT THE SEA IN OVER LOW PLAINS OF LARGE EXTENT THUS DEEPLY INDENTING THE CONTINENTAL OUT LINE
3092-39501-0088 THE RISE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET WOULD RESTORE THESE SUBMERGED PLAINS TO THE LAND THE CYCLE OF SHORES OF DEPRESSION
3092-39501-0089 IN ITS INFANTILE STAGE THE OUTLINE OF A SHORE OF DEPRESSION DEPENDS ALMOST WHOLLY ON THE PREVIOUS RELIEF OF THE LAND AND BUT LITTLE ON EROSION BY THE SEA SEA CLIFFS AND NARROW BENCHES APPEAR
3092-39501-0090 WHERE HEADLANDS AND OUTLYING ISLANDS HAVE BEEN NIPPED BY THE WAVES AS YET LITTLE SHORE WASTE HAS BEEN FORMED THE COAST OF MAINE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS STAGE IN EARLY YOUTH ALL PROMONTORIES HAVE BEEN STRONGLY CLIFFED
3092-39501-0091 AND UNDER A VIGOROUS ATTACK OF THE SEA THE SHORE OF OPEN BAYS MAY BE CUT BACK ALSO SEA STACKS AND ROCKY ISLETS CAVES AND COVES MAKE THE SHORE MINUTELY RAGGED THE IRREGULARITY OF THE COAST DUE TO DEPRESSION
3092-39501-0092 IS FOR A WHILE INCREASED BY DIFFERENTIAL WAVE WEAR ON HARDER AND SOFTER ROCKS THE ROCK BENCH IS STILL NARROW SHORE WASTE THOUGH BEING PRODUCED IN LARGE AMOUNTS IS FOR THE MOST PART SWEPT INTO DEEPER WATER AND BURIED OUT OF SIGHT
3092-39501-0093 EXAMPLES OF THIS STAGE ARE THE EAST COAST OF SCOTLAND AND THE CALIFORNIA COAST NEAR SAN FRANCISCO LATER YOUTH IS CHARACTERIZED BY A LARGE ACCUMULATION OF SHORE WASTE
3092-39501-0094 THE ROCK BENCH HAS BEEN CUT BACK SO THAT IT NOW FURNISHES A GOOD ROADWAY FOR SHORE DRIFT THE STREAM OF ALONGSHORE DRIFT GROWS LARGER AND LARGER FILLING THE HEADS OF THE SMALLER BAYS WITH BEACHES BUILDING SPITS AND HOOKS
3092-39501-0095 AND TYING ISLANDS WITH SAND BARS TO THE MAINLAND IT BRIDGES THE LARGER BAYS WITH BAY BARS WHILE THEIR LENGTH IS BEING REDUCED AS THEIR INCLOSING PROMONTORIES ARE CUT BACK BY THE WAVES
3092-39501-0096 THE BAYS INTO WHICH THEY EMPTY BY THESE STEPS A COAST GRADUALLY ADVANCES TO MATURITY THE STAGE WHEN THE IRREGULARITIES DUE TO DEPRESSION HAVE BEEN EFFACED WHEN OUTLYING ISLANDS FORMED BY SUBSIDENCE HAVE BEEN PLANED AWAY
3092-39501-0097 AND WHEN THE SHORE LINE HAS BEEN DRIVEN BACK BEHIND THE FORMER BAY HEADS THE SEA NOW ATTACKS THE LAND MOST EFFECTIVELY ALONG A CONTINUOUS AND FAIRLY STRAIGHT LINE OF CLIFFS
3092-39501-0098 ALTHOUGH THE FIRST EFFECT OF WAVE WEAR WAS TO INCREASE THE IRREGULARITIES OF THE SHORE IT SOONER OR LATER RECTIFIES IT MAKING IT SIMPLE AND SMOOTH NORTHWESTERN FRANCE MAY BE CITED AS AN UPLAND PLAIN DISSECTED AND DEPRESSED
3092-39501-0099 WHOSE COAST HAS REACHED MATURITY IN THE OLD AGE OF COASTS THE ROCK BENCH IS CUT BACK SO FAR THAT THE WAVES CAN NO LONGER EXERT THEIR FULL EFFECT UPON THE SHORE
3092-39501-0100 THEIR ENERGY IS DISSIPATED IN MOVING SHORE DRIFT HITHER AND THITHER AND IN ABRADING THE BENCH WHEN THEY DRAG BOTTOM UPON IT LITTLE BY LITTLE THE BENCH IS DEEPENED BY TIDAL CURRENTS AND THE DRAG OF WAVES
3092-39501-0101 AND SWEEP IT OUT TO SEA PLAINS OF MARINE ABRASION
3092-39501-0102 THE SEA IS SAWING ITS EDGES TO WAVE BASE I E THE LOWEST LIMIT OF THE WAVE'S EFFECTIVE WEAR THE WIDENED ROCK BENCH FORMS WHEN UPLIFTED A PLAIN OF MARINE ABRASION
3092-39501-0103 COMPARED WITH SUBAERIAL DENUDATION MARINE ABRASION IS A COMPARATIVELY FEEBLE AGENT AT THE RATE OF FIVE FEET PER CENTURY A HIGHER RATE THAN OBTAINS ON THE YOUTHFUL ROCKY COAST OF BRITAIN
3092-39501-0104 IT WOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN TEN MILLION YEARS TO PARE A STRIP ONE HUNDRED MILES WIDE FROM THE MARGIN OF A CONTINENT A TIME SUFFICIENT AT THE RATE AT WHICH THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IS NOW BEING WORN AWAY
3092-39501-0105 FOR SUBAERIAL DENUDATION TO LOWER THE LANDS OF THE GLOBE TO THE LEVEL OF THE SEA SLOW SUBMERGENCE FAVORS THE CUTTING OF A WIDE ROCK BENCH THE WATER CONTINUALLY DEEPENS UPON THE BENCH
3092-39501-0106 STORM WAVES CAN THEREFORE ALWAYS RIDE IN TO THE BASE OF THE CLIFFS AND ATTACK THEM WITH FULL FORCE SHORE WASTE CANNOT IMPEDE THE ONSET OF THE WAVES FOR IT IS CONTINUALLY WASHED OUT IN DEEPER WATER
3092-39501-0107 BELOW WAVE BASE BASAL CONGOLMERATES AS THE SEA MARCHES ACROSS THE LAND DURING A SLOW SUBMERGENCE THE PLATFORM IS COVERED WITH SHEETS OF SEA LAID SEDIMENTS
3092-39501-0108 LOWEST OF THESE IS A CONGLOMERATE THE BOWLDER AND PEBBLE BEACH WIDENED INDEFINITELY BY THE RETREAT OF THE CLIFFS AT WHOSE BASE IT WAS FORMED AND PRESERVED BY THE FINER DEPOSITS LAID UPON IT
3092-39501-0109 IN THE CONSTANTLY DEEPENING WATER AS THE LAND SUBSIDES SUCH BASAL CONGLOMERATES ARE NOT UNCOMMON AMONG THE ANCIENT ROCKS OF THE LAND AND WE MAY KNOW THEM BY THEIR ROUNDED PEBBLES AND LARGER STONES
