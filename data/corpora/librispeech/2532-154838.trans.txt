2532-154838-0000 TWAS WITH THOUGHTS LIKE THIS THAT I WAS BUSY WHILE THE SHORT AFTERNOON WAS SPENT AND THE STORY WENT UP AND DOWN THE VILLAGE
2532-154838-0001 WERE COME BACK TO MOONFLEET AND THAT THE OLD LANDER WAS DROWNED SAVING THE YOUNG MAN'S LIFE THE DUSK WAS CREEPING UP AS I TURNED BACK THE SAIL FROM OFF HIS FACE AND TOOK ANOTHER LOOK AT MY LOST FRIEND MY ONLY FRIEND
2532-154838-0002 FOR WHO WAS THERE NOW TO CARE A JOT FOR ME I MIGHT GO AND DROWN MYSELF ON MOONFLEET BEACH FOR ANYONE THAT WOULD GRIEVE OVER ME WHAT DID IT PROFIT ME TO HAVE BROKEN BONDS AND TO BE FREE AGAIN WHAT USE WAS FREEDOM TO ME NOW WHERE WAS I TO GO
2532-154838-0003 WHAT WAS I TO DO MY FRIEND WAS GONE SO I WENT BACK AND SAT WITH MY HEAD IN MY HANDS LOOKING INTO THE FIRE WHEN I HEARD SOMEONE STEP INTO THE ROOM BUT DID NOT TURN THINKING IT WAS MASTER RATSEY COME BACK
2532-154838-0004 THEN I FELT A LIGHT TOUCH ON MY SHOULDER AND LOOKING UP SAW STANDING BY ME A TALL AND STATELY WOMAN GIRL NO LONGER BUT WOMAN IN THE FULL STRENGTH AND BEAUTY OF YOUTH I KNEW HER IN A MOMENT FOR SHE HAD ALTERED LITTLE
2532-154838-0005 EXCEPT HER OVAL FACE HAD SOMETHING MORE OF DIGNITY AND THE TAWNY HAIR THAT USED TO FLY ABOUT HER BACK WAS NOW GATHERED UP SHE WAS LOOKING DOWN AT ME AND LET HER HAND REST ON MY SHOULDER JOHN SHE SAID HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ME
2532-154838-0006 MAY I NOT SHARE YOUR SORROW DID YOU NOT THINK TO TELL ME YOU WERE COME DID YOU NOT SEE THE LIGHT DID YOU NOT KNOW THERE WAS A FRIEND THAT WAITED FOR YOU I SAID NOTHING NOT BEING ABLE TO SPEAK
2532-154838-0007 BUT MARVELLING HOW SHE HAD COME JUST IN THE POINT OF TIME TO PROVE ME WRONG TO THINK I HAD NO FRIEND AND SHE WENT ON IS IT WELL FOR YOU TO BE HERE GRIEVE NOT TOO SADLY FOR NONE COULD HAVE DIED NOBLER THAN HE DIED
2532-154838-0008 AND IN THESE YEARS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN AWAY I HAVE THOUGHT MUCH OF HIM AND FOUND HIM GOOD AT HEART AND IF HE DID AUGHT WRONG TWAS BECAUSE OTHERS WRONGED HIM MORE AND WHILE SHE SPOKE I THOUGHT HOW ELZEVIR HAD GONE TO SHOOT HER FATHER
2532-154838-0009 AND ONLY FAILED OF IT BY A HAIR'S BREADTH AND YET SHE SPOKE SO WELL I THOUGHT HE NEVER REALLY MEANT TO SHOOT AT ALL BUT ONLY TO SCARE THE MAGISTRATE
2532-154838-0010 AND THEN THAT HE SHOULD SAVE MY LIFE AND NOW THAT MASKEW'S DAUGHTER SHOULD BE THE ONE TO PRAISE ELZEVIR WHEN HE LAY DEAD AND STILL I COULD NOT SPEAK AND AGAIN SHE SAID JOHN HAVE YOU NO WORD FOR ME HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
2532-154838-0011 BUT OF LOVE I MAY NOT SPEAK MORE TO YOU NOR YOU TO ME FOR WE ARE NO MORE BOY AND GIRL AS IN TIMES PAST BUT YOU A NOBLE LADY AND I A BROKEN WRETCH
2532-154838-0012 AND WHY AND SHOWED HER THE IRON RING UPON MY WRIST AND THE BRAND UPON MY CHEEK AT THE BRAND SHE STARED AND SAID
2532-154838-0013 BUT THE MOHUNES BADGE TO SHOW THAT YOU ARE THEIRS AND MUST DO THEIR BIDDING
2532-154838-0014 BUT NOW I PRAY YOU WITH A GREATER EARNESTNESS SEEING YOU BEAR THIS MARK UPON YOU TOUCH NO PENNY OF THAT TREASURE IF IT SHOULD SOME DAY COME BACK TO YOU BUT PUT IT TO SUCH USES AS COLONEL MOHUNE THOUGHT WOULD HELP HIS SINFUL SOUL
2532-154838-0015 AND THE OUTLINE OF THE BODY THAT LAY UNDER IT AFTER SHE WAS GONE I PONDERED LONG OVER WHAT SHE HAD SAID AND WHAT THAT SHOULD MEAN WHEN SHE SPOKE OF THE TREASURE ONE DAY COMING BACK TO ME BUT WONDERED MUCH THE MOST TO FIND HOW CONSTANT IS THE LOVE OF WOMAN
2532-154838-0016 AND HOW SHE COULD STILL FIND A PLACE IN HER HEART FOR SO POOR A THING AS I BUT AS TO WHAT SHE SAID I WAS TO LEARN HER MEANING THIS VERY NIGHT MASTER RATSEY HAD COME IN AND GONE AGAIN NOT STOPPING WITH ME VERY LONG BECAUSE THERE WAS MUCH DOING ON THE BEACH
2532-154838-0017 BUT BIDDING ME BE OF GOOD CHEER AND HAVE NO FEAR OF THE LAW FOR THAT THE BAN AGAINST ME AND THE HEAD PRICE HAD BEEN DEAD FOR MANY A YEAR TWAS GRACE HAD MADE HER LAWYERS MOVE FOR THIS REFUSING HERSELF TO SIGN THE HUE AND CRY
2532-154838-0018 AND SITTING UP OFFERED HIM WHAT WELCOME I COULD HE LOOKED AT ME CURIOUSLY AT FIRST AS TAKING NOTE OF THE BEARDED MAN THAT HAD GROWN OUT OF THE BOY HE REMEMBERED BUT GAVE ME VERY KINDLY GREETING AND SAT DOWN BESIDE ME ON A BENCH
2532-154838-0019 FIRST HE LIFTED THE SAIL FROM THE DEAD BODY AND LOOKED AT THE SLEEPING FACE THEN HE TOOK OUT A COMMON PRAYER READING THE COMMENDAMUS OVER THE DEAD AND GIVING ME SPIRITUAL COMFORT AND LASTLY HE FELL TO TALKING ABOUT THE PAST
2532-154838-0020 SO THAT I WAS ANOTHER FRIEND THE LESS IF INDEED I SHOULD COUNT HER A FRIEND FOR THOUGH SHE MEANT ME WELL SHE SHOWED HER CARE WITH TOO MUCH STRICTNESS TO LET ME LOVE HER AND SO IN MY GREAT SORROW FOR ELZEVIR I FOUND NO ROOM TO GRIEVE FOR HER
2532-154838-0021 AND THOUGH I MAY BY SOME BE REPREHENDED HE SAID FOR PRESUMING TO REFER TO PROFANE AUTHORS AFTER CITING HOLY SCRIPTURE YET I CANNOT REFRAIN FROM SAYING THAT EVEN THE GREAT POET HOMER COUNSELS MODERATION IN MOURNING FOR QUICKLY SAYS HE
2532-154838-0022 COMETH SATIETY OF CHILLY GRIEF AFTER THIS I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING BUT HE CLEARED HIS THROAT IN SUCH A WAY THAT I GUESSED HE HAD SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY AND HE DREW A LONG FOLDED BLUE PAPER FROM HIS POCKET MY SON HE SAID
2532-154838-0023 WE SHOULD NEVER REVILE FORTUNE
2532-154838-0024 AND DO NOT IMPLY THAT THERE IS ANY CHANCE AT ALL BUT WHAT IS SUBJECT TO AN OVER RULING PROVIDENCE WE SHOULD NEVER I SAY REVILE FORTUNE
2532-154838-0025 SHE MAY BE ONLY GONE AWAY TO SEEK SOME RICHEST TREASURE TO BRING BACK WITH HER AND THAT THIS IS SO LET WHAT I AM ABOUT TO READ TO YOU PROVE SO LIGHT A CANDLE AND SET IT BY ME FOR MY EYES CANNOT FOLLOW THE WRITING IN THIS DANCING FIRELIGHT
2532-154838-0026 IT WAS ADDRESSED TO THE REVEREND HORACE GLENNIE PERPETUAL CURATE OF MOONFLEET
2532-154838-0027 IT SET FORTH THAT ONE KRISPIJN ALDOBRAND JEWELLER AND DEALER IN PRECIOUS STONES AT THE HAGUE HAD SENT FOR HEER ROOSTEN TO DRAW A WILL FOR HIM
2532-154838-0028 THAT HE ALDOBRAND WAS DESIROUS TO LEAVE ALL HIS GOODS TO ONE
2532-154838-0029 FOR THAT HE HAD ONCE OBTAINED FROM THE SAID JOHN A DIAMOND WITHOUT PAYING THE PROPER PRICE FOR IT WHICH STONE HE ALDOBRAND HAD SOLD AND CONVERTED INTO MONEY
2532-154838-0030 THESE HAD FORTHWITH MELTED THROUGH UNFORTUNATE VENTURES AND SPECULATIONS TILL HE HAD LITTLE REMAINING TO HIM BUT THE MONEY THAT THIS SAME DIAMOND HAD BROUGHT
2532-154838-0031 IT WAS WELL HEER ROOSTEN ADDED THAT THE WILL HAD BEEN DRAWN IN GOOD TIME
2532-154838-0032 HE SAW CONTINUALLY A TALL MAN WITH A COPPERY FACE AND BLACK BEARD DRAW THE BED CURTAINS AND MOCK HIM THUS HE CAME AT LENGTH TO HIS END
2532-154838-0033 THIS INFORMATION WAS HOWEVER ALWAYS POSTPONED
2532-154838-0034 AND WAS THEN NOWHERE TO BE FOUND AFTER THAT HEER ROOSTEN WAS ADVISED TO WRITE TO THE MINISTER OF THE PARISH AND SO ADDRESSED THESE LINES TO MISTER GLENNIE THIS WAS THE GIST OF THE LETTER WHICH MISTER GLENNIE READ AND YOU MAY EASILY GUESS HOW SUCH NEWS MOVED ME
2532-154838-0035 HE MADE A GOOD END JOHN HE SAID RISING FROM HIS KNEES AND I PRAY THAT OUR END MAY BE IN AS GOOD CAUSE WHEN IT COMES FOR WITH THE BEST OF US THE HOUR OF DEATH IS AN AWFUL HOUR AND WE MAY WELL PRAY AS EVERY SUNDAY
2532-154838-0036 TO BE DELIVERED IN IT BUT THERE IS ANOTHER TIME WHICH THOSE WHO WROTE THIS LITANY THOUGHT NO LESS PERILOUS AND BADE US PRAY TO BE DELIVERED IN ALL TIME OF OUR WEALTH SO I PRAY THAT IF AFTER ALL THIS WEALTH COMES TO YOUR HAND YOU MAY BE LED TO USE IT WELL
2532-154838-0037 AS COLONEL JOHN MOHUNE SET APART THIS TREASURE IT CANNOT BE BUT THAT WE SHALL DO GRIEVOUS WRONG IN PUTTING THEM TO OTHER USE SO FARE YOU WELL AND REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE OTHER TREASURES BESIDES THIS AND THAT A GOOD WOMAN'S LOVE
2532-154838-0038 IS WORTH FAR MORE THAN ALL THE GOLD AND JEWELS OF THE WORLD AS I ONCE KNEW AND WITH THAT HE LEFT ME I GUESSED THAT HE HAD SPOKEN WITH GRACE THAT DAY AND AS I LAY DOZING IN FRONT OF THE FIRE ALONE IN THIS OLD ROOM I KNEW SO WELL
2532-154838-0039 ALONE WITH THAT SILENT FRIEND WHO HAD DIED TO SAVE ME I MOURNED HIM NONE THE LESS BUT YET SORROWED NOT AS ONE WITHOUT HOPE
2532-154838-0040 SINCE YOU MAY KNOW BY MY TELLING IT THAT ALL WENT WELL FOR WHAT MAN WOULD SIT DOWN TO WRITE A HISTORY THAT ENDED IN HIS OWN DISCOMFITURE ALL THAT GREAT WEALTH CAME TO MY HANDS AND IF I DO NOT SAY HOW GREAT IT WAS
2532-154838-0041 AND OF THAT MONEY I NEVER TOUCHED PENNY PIECE HAVING LEARNT A BITTER LESSON IN THE PAST BUT LAID IT OUT IN GOOD WORKS WITH MISTER GLENNIE AND GRACE TO HELP ME FIRST WE REBUILT AND ENLARGED THE ALMSHOUSES BEYOND ALL THAT COLONEL JOHN MOHUNE COULD EVER THINK OF
2532-154838-0042 AND SO ESTABLISHED THEM AS TO BE A HAVEN FOR EVER FOR ALL WORN OUT SAILORS OF THAT COAST NEXT WE SOUGHT THE GUIDANCE OF THE BRETHREN OF THE TRINITY AND BUILT A LIGHTHOUSE ON THE SNOUT TO BE A CHANNEL BEACON FOR SEA GOING SHIPS
2532-154838-0043 AS MASKEW'S MATCH HAD BEEN A LIGHT FOR OUR FISHING BOATS IN THE PAST LASTLY WE BEAUTIFIED THE CHURCH TURNING OUT THE CUMBROUS SEATS OF OAK AND NEATLY PEWING IT WITH DEAL AND BAIZE THAT MADE IT MOST COMMODIOUS TO SIT IN OF THE SABBATH
2532-154838-0044 THERE WAS ALSO MUCH OLD GLASS WHICH WE REMOVED AND REGLAZED ALL THE WINDOWS TIGHT AGAINST THE WIND SO THAT WHAT WITH A HIGH PULPIT READING DESK AND SEAT FOR MASTER CLERK AND NEW COMMANDMENT BOARDS EACH SIDE OF THE HOLY TABLE
2532-154838-0045 THERE WAS NOT A CHURCH COULD VIE WITH OURS IN THE COUNTRYSIDE BUT THAT GREAT VAULT BELOW IT WITH ITS MEMORIES WAS SET IN ORDER AND THEN SAFELY WALLED UP AND AFTER THAT NOTHING WAS MORE EVER HEARD OF BLACKBEARD AND HIS LOST MOHUNES
2532-154838-0046 AND AS FOR THE LANDERS I CANNOT SAY WHERE THEY WENT AND IF A CARGO IS STILL RUN OF A DARK NIGHT UPON THE BEACH I KNOW NOTHING OF IT BEING BOTH LORD OF THE MANOR AND JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
2532-154838-0047 THE VILLAGE TOO RENEWED ITSELF WITH THE NEW ALMSHOUSES AND CHURCH THERE WERE OLD HOUSES REBUILT AND FRESH ONES REARED AND ALL ARE OURS EXCEPT THE WHY NOT WHICH STILL REMAINS THE DUCHY INN
2532-154838-0048 AND CAME BACK TO THEIR OLD HAUNT AND ANY SHIPWRECKED OR TRAVEL WORN SAILOR FOUND BOARD AND WELCOME WITHIN ITS DOORS AND OF THE MOHUNE HOSPITAL FOR THAT WAS WHAT THE ALMS HOUSES WERE NOW CALLED MASTER GLENNIE WAS FIRST WARDEN WITH FAIR ROOMS AND A FULL LIBRARY
2532-154838-0049 THAT A MAN LAY DOWN HIS LIFE FOR HIS FRIEND AND SOME OF MISTER GLENNIE'S VERSES AND OF OURSELVES LET ME SPEAK LAST THE MANOR HOUSE IS A STATELY HOME AGAIN WITH TRIM LAWNS AND TERRACED BALUSTRADES
2532-154838-0050 WHERE WE CAN SIT AND SEE THE THIN BLUE SMOKE HANG ABOVE THE VILLAGE ON SUMMER EVENINGS AND IN THE MANOR WOODS MY WIFE AND I HAVE SEEN A LITTLE GRACE AND A LITTLE JOHN AND LITTLE ELZEVIR OUR FIRSTBORN PLAY AND NOW OUR DAUGHTER IS GROWN UP
2532-154838-0051 FAIR TO US AS THE POLISHED CORNERS OF THE TEMPLE AND OUR SONS ARE GONE OUT TO SERVE KING GEORGE ON SEA AND LAND BUT AS FOR US FOR GRACE AND ME WE NEVER LEAVE THIS OUR HAPPY MOONFLEET BEING WELL CONTENT TO SEE THE DAWN TIPPING THE LONG CLIFF LINE WITH GOLD
2532-154838-0052 AND THE NIGHT WALKING IN DEW ACROSS THE MEADOWS TO WATCH THE SPRING CLOTHE THE BEECH BOUGHS WITH GREEN OR THE FIGS RIPEN ON THE SOUTHERN WALL WHILE BEHIND ALL IS SPREAD AS A CURTAIN THE ETERNAL SEA EVER THE SAME AND EVER CHANGING
2532-154838-0053 YET I LOVE TO SEE IT BEST WHEN IT IS LASHED TO MADNESS IN THE AUTUMN GALE
2532-154838-0054 TIS THEN I TURN IN BED AND THANK GOD MORE FROM THE HEART PERHAPS THAN ANY OTHER LIVING MAN THAT I AM NOT FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE ON MOONFLEET BEACH AND MORE THAN ONCE I HAVE STOOD ROPE IN HAND IN THAT SAME AWFUL PLACE
2532-154838-0055 AND TRIED TO SAVE A STRUGGLING WRETCH BUT NEVER SAW ONE COME THROUGH THE SURF ALIVE
