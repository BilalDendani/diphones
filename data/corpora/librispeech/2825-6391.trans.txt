2825-6391-0000 AUTHOR'S NOTE NOSTROMO IS THE MOST ANXIOUSLY MEDITATED OF THE LONGER NOVELS WHICH BELONG TO THE PERIOD FOLLOWING UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THE TYPHOON VOLUME OF SHORT STORIES
2825-6391-0001 I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT I BECAME THEN CONSCIOUS OF ANY IMPENDING CHANGE IN MY MENTALITY
2825-6391-0002 A PHENOMENON FOR WHICH I CAN NOT IN ANY WAY BE HELD RESPONSIBLE WHAT HOWEVER DID CAUSE ME SOME CONCERN WAS THAT AFTER FINISHING THE LAST STORY OF THE TYPHOON VOLUME
2825-6391-0003 IT SEEMED SOMEHOW THAT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE IN THE WORLD TO WRITE ABOUT THIS SO STRANGELY NEGATIVE BUT DISTURBING MOOD LASTED SOME LITTLE TIME AND THEN AS WITH MANY OF MY LONGER STORIES
2825-6391-0004 THE FIRST HINT FOR NOSTROMO CAME TO ME IN THE SHAPE OF A VAGRANT ANECDOTE COMPLETELY DESTITUTE OF VALUABLE DETAILS AS A MATTER OF FACT IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE OR SIX WHEN VERY YOUNG
2825-6391-0005 I WAS NOT LIKELY TO KEEP THAT ONE IN MY MIND AND I FORGOT IT TILL TWENTY SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AFTERWARDS I CAME UPON THE VERY THING IN A SHABBY VOLUME PICKED UP OUTSIDE A SECOND HAND BOOK SHOP
2825-6391-0006 IT WAS THE LIFE STORY OF AN AMERICAN SEAMAN WRITTEN BY HIMSELF WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A JOURNALIST IN THE COURSE OF HIS WANDERINGS THAT AMERICAN SAILOR WORKED FOR SOME MONTHS ON BOARD A SCHOONER THE MASTER AND OWNER OF WHICH WAS THE THIEF
2825-6391-0007 OF WHOM I HAD HEARD IN MY VERY YOUNG DAYS I HAVE NO DOUBT OF THAT BECAUSE THERE COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN TWO EXPLOITS OF THAT PECULIAR KIND IN THE SAME PART OF THE WORLD AND BOTH CONNECTED WITH A SOUTH AMERICAN REVOLUTION
2825-6391-0008 THE FELLOW HAD ACTUALLY MANAGED TO STEAL A LIGHTER WITH SILVER AND THIS IT SEEMS
2825-6391-0009 AND ALTOGETHER UNWORTHY OF THE GREATNESS THIS OPPORTUNITY HAD THRUST UPON HIM
2825-6391-0010 THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER CURIOUS POINT ABOUT THE MAN ONCE IN THE COURSE OF SOME QUARREL THE SAILOR THREATENED HIM
2825-6391-0011 THE CYNICAL RUFFIAN WAS NOT ALARMED IN THE LEAST HE ACTUALLY LAUGHED YOU FOOL IF YOU DARE TALK LIKE THAT ON SHORE ABOUT ME YOU WILL GET A KNIFE STUCK IN YOUR BACK
2825-6391-0012 EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD IN THAT PORT IS MY FRIEND AND WHO'S TO PROVE THE LIGHTER WASN'T SUNK I DIDN'T SHOW YOU WHERE THE SILVER IS HIDDEN DID I SO YOU KNOW NOTHING
2825-6391-0013 ULTIMATELY THE SAILOR DISGUSTED WITH THE SORDID MEANNESS OF THAT IMPENITENT THIEF DESERTED FROM THE SCHOONER THE WHOLE EPISODE TAKES ABOUT THREE PAGES OF HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY NOTHING TO SPEAK OF
2825-6391-0014 BUT AS I LOOKED THEM OVER THE CURIOUS CONFIRMATION OF THE FEW CASUAL WORDS HEARD IN MY EARLY YOUTH EVOKED THE MEMORIES OF THAT DISTANT TIME WHEN EVERYTHING WAS SO FRESH SO SURPRISING SO VENTURESOME
2825-6391-0015 SO INTERESTING BITS OF STRANGE COASTS UNDER THE STARS SHADOWS OF HILLS IN THE SUNSHINE MEN'S PASSIONS IN THE DUSK GOSSIP HALF FORGOTTEN
2825-6391-0016 PERHAPS PERHAPS THERE STILL WAS IN THE WORLD SOMETHING TO WRITE ABOUT YET I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING AT FIRST IN THE MERE STORY A RASCAL STEALS A LARGE PARCEL OF A VALUABLE COMMODITY
2825-6391-0017 SO PEOPLE SAY IT'S EITHER TRUE OR UNTRUE AND IN ANY CASE IT HAS NO VALUE IN ITSELF TO INVENT A CIRCUMSTANTIAL ACCOUNT OF THE ROBBERY DID NOT APPEAL TO ME BECAUSE MY TALENTS NOT RUNNING THAT WAY
2825-6391-0018 I DID NOT THINK THAT THE GAME WAS WORTH THE CANDLE IT WAS ONLY WHEN IT DAWNED UPON ME THAT THE PURLOINER OF THE TREASURE NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE A CONFIRMED ROGUE THAT HE COULD BE EVEN A MAN OF CHARACTER
2825-6391-0019 AN ACTOR AND POSSIBLY A VICTIM IN THE CHANGING SCENES OF A REVOLUTION IT WAS ONLY THEN THAT I HAD THE FIRST VISION OF A TWILIGHT COUNTRY WHICH WAS TO BECOME THE PROVINCE OF SULACO WITH ITS HIGH SHADOWY SIERRA
2825-6391-0020 AND ITS MISTY CAMPO FOR MUTE WITNESSES OF EVENTS FLOWING FROM THE PASSIONS OF MEN SHORT SIGHTED IN GOOD AND EVIL SUCH ARE IN VERY TRUTH
2825-6391-0021 THE OBSCURE ORIGINS OF NOSTROMO THE BOOK FROM THAT MOMENT I SUPPOSE IT HAD TO BE YET EVEN THEN I HESITATED AS IF WARNED BY THE INSTINCT OF SELF PRESERVATION
2825-6391-0022 FROM VENTURING ON A DISTANT AND TOILSOME JOURNEY INTO A LAND FULL OF INTRIGUES AND REVOLUTIONS BUT IT HAD TO BE DONE IT TOOK THE BEST PART OF THE YEARS NINETEEN O THREE FOUR TO DO
2825-6391-0023 WITH MANY INTERVALS OF RENEWED HESITATION LEST I SHOULD LOSE MYSELF IN THE EVER ENLARGING VISTAS OPENING BEFORE ME AS I PROGRESSED DEEPER IN MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE COUNTRY
2825-6391-0024 OFTEN ALSO WHEN I HAD THOUGHT MYSELF TO A STANDSTILL OVER THE TANGLED UP AFFAIRS OF THE REPUBLIC I WOULD FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING PACK MY BAG RUSH AWAY FROM SULACO FOR A CHANGE OF AIR
2825-6391-0025 AND WRITE A FEW PAGES OF THE MIRROR OF THE SEA BUT GENERALLY AS I'VE SAID BEFORE MY SOJOURN ON THE CONTINENT OF LATIN AMERICA FAMED FOR ITS HOSPITALITY LASTED FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS
2825-6391-0026 ON MY RETURN I FOUND SPEAKING SOMEWHAT IN THE STYLE OF CAPTAIN GULLIVER MY FAMILY ALL WELL MY WIFE HEARTILY GLAD TO LEARN THAT THE FUSS WAS ALL OVER AND OUR SMALL BOY CONSIDERABLY GROWN
2825-6391-0027 DURING MY ABSENCE MY PRINCIPAL AUTHORITY FOR THE HISTORY OF COSTAGUANA IS OF COURSE MY VENERATED FRIEND THE LATE DON JOSE AVELLANOS MINISTER TO THE COURTS OF ENGLAND AND SPAIN ET CETERA ET CETERA
2825-6391-0028 IN HIS IMPARTIAL AND ELOQUENT HISTORY OF FIFTY YEARS OF MISRULE THAT WORK WAS NEVER PUBLISHED THE READER WILL DISCOVER WHY AND I AM IN FACT THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD POSSESSED OF ITS CONTENTS
2825-6391-0029 I HAVE MASTERED THEM IN NOT A FEW HOURS OF EARNEST MEDITATION AND I HOPE THAT MY ACCURACY WILL BE TRUSTED IN JUSTICE TO MYSELF AND TO ALLAY THE FEARS OF PROSPECTIVE READERS I BEG TO POINT OUT THAT
2825-6391-0030 THE FEW HISTORICAL ALLUSIONS ARE NEVER DRAGGED IN FOR THE SAKE OF PARADING MY UNIQUE ERUDITION BUT THAT EACH OF THEM IS CLOSELY RELATED TO ACTUALITY EITHER THROWING A LIGHT ON THE NATURE OF CURRENT EVENTS
2825-6391-0031 OR AFFECTING DIRECTLY THE FORTUNES OF THE PEOPLE OF WHOM I SPEAK AS TO THEIR OWN HISTORIES I HAVE TRIED TO SET THEM DOWN ARISTOCRACY AND PEOPLE MEN AND WOMEN LATIN AND ANGLO SAXON
2825-6391-0032 HOW FAR THEY ARE DESERVING OF INTEREST IN THEIR ACTIONS AND IN THE SECRET PURPOSES OF THEIR HEARTS REVEALED IN THE BITTER NECESSITIES OF THE TIME I CONFESS THAT FOR ME THAT TIME IS THE TIME OF FIRM FRIENDSHIPS
2825-6391-0033 AND UNFORGOTTEN HOSPITALITIES AND IN MY GRATITUDE I MUST MENTION HERE MISSUS GOULD THE FIRST LADY OF SULACO WHOM WE MAY SAFELY LEAVE TO THE SECRET DEVOTION OF DOCTOR MONYGHAM AND CHARLES GOULD
2825-6391-0034 BOTH CAPTURED BY THE SILVER OF THE SAN TOME MINE I FEEL BOUND TO SAY SOMETHING MORE I DID NOT HESITATE TO MAKE THAT CENTRAL FIGURE AN ITALIAN FIRST OF ALL THE THING IS PERFECTLY CREDIBLE ITALIANS WERE SWARMING INTO THE OCCIDENTAL PROVINCE AT THE TIME
2825-6391-0035 AS ANYBODY WHO WILL READ FURTHER CAN SEE AND SECONDLY THERE WAS NO ONE WHO COULD STAND SO WELL BY THE SIDE OF GIORGIO VIOLA THE GARIBALDINO THE IDEALIST OF THE OLD HUMANITARIAN REVOLUTIONS FOR MYSELF
2825-6391-0036 I NEEDED THERE A MAN OF THE PEOPLE AS FREE AS POSSIBLE FROM HIS CLASS CONVENTIONS AND ALL SETTLED MODES OF THINKING THIS IS NOT A SIDE SNARL AT CONVENTIONS MY REASONS WERE NOT MORAL BUT ARTISTIC HAD HE BEEN AN ANGLO SAXON
2825-6391-0037 BUT MAINLY NOSTROMO IS WHAT HE IS BECAUSE I RECEIVED THE INSPIRATION FOR HIM IN MY EARLY DAYS FROM A MEDITERRANEAN SAILOR THOSE WHO HAVE READ CERTAIN PAGES OF MINE WILL SEE AT ONCE WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY THAT DOMINIC
2825-6391-0038 THERE MUST AFTER ALL HAVE BEEN SOMETHING IN ME WORTHY TO COMMAND THAT MAN'S HALF BITTER FIDELITY HIS HALF IRONIC DEVOTION MANY OF NOSTROMO'S SPEECHES I HAVE HEARD FIRST IN DOMINIC'S VOICE
2825-6391-0039 HIS HAND ON THE TILLER AND HIS FEARLESS EYES ROAMING THE HORIZON FROM WITHIN THE MONKISH HOOD SHADOWING HIS FACE
2825-6391-0040 VERY MUCH LIKE NOSTROMO BUT DOMINIC THE CORSICAN NURSED A CERTAIN PRIDE OF ANCESTRY FROM WHICH MY NOSTROMO IS FREE FOR NOSTROMO'S LINEAGE HAD TO BE MORE ANCIENT STILL
2825-6391-0041 HE IS A MAN WITH THE WEIGHT OF COUNTLESS GENERATIONS BEHIND HIM AND NO PARENTAGE TO BOAST OF LIKE THE PEOPLE IN HIS FIRM GRIP ON THE EARTH HE INHERITS IN HIS IMPROVIDENCE AND GENEROSITY
2825-6391-0042 DISDAINING TO LEAD BUT RULING FROM WITHIN YEARS AFTERWARDS GROWN OLDER AS THE FAMOUS CAPTAIN FIDANZA WITH A STAKE IN THE COUNTRY GOING ABOUT HIS MANY AFFAIRS FOLLOWED BY RESPECTFUL GLANCES
2825-6391-0043 IN THE MODERNIZED STREETS OF SULACO CALLING ON THE WIDOW OF THE CARGADOR ATTENDING THE LODGE LISTENING IN UNMOVED SILENCE TO ANARCHIST SPEECHES AT THE MEETING
2825-6391-0044 THE ENIGMATICAL PATRON OF THE NEW REVOLUTIONARY AGITATION THE TRUSTED THE WEALTHY COMRADE FIDANZA WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS MORAL RUIN LOCKED UP IN HIS BREAST HE REMAINS ESSENTIALLY A MAN
2825-6391-0045 OF THE PEOPLE IN HIS MINGLED LOVE AND SCORN OF LIFE AND IN THE BEWILDERED CONVICTION OF HAVING BEEN BETRAYED OF DYING BETRAYED HE HARDLY KNOWS BY WHAT OR BY WHOM HE IS STILL OF THE PEOPLE THEIR UNDOUBTED GREAT MAN
2825-6391-0046 WITH A PRIVATE HISTORY OF HIS OWN ONE MORE FIGURE OF THOSE STIRRING TIMES I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION AND THAT IS
2825-6391-0047 WHETHER SHE IS A POSSIBLE VARIATION OF LATIN AMERICAN GIRLHOOD I WOULDN'T DARE TO AFFIRM BUT FOR ME SHE IS
2825-6391-0048 THE ASPECT OF CONTINUED LIFE ANTONIA THE ARISTOCRAT AND NOSTROMO THE MAN OF THE PEOPLE ARE THE ARTISANS OF THE NEW ERA THE TRUE CREATORS OF THE NEW STATE HE BY HIS LEGENDARY AND DARING FEAT
2825-6391-0049 OF A TRIFLER IF ANYTHING COULD INDUCE ME TO REVISIT SULACO I SHOULD HATE TO SEE ALL THESE CHANGES IT WOULD BE ANTONIA AND THE TRUE REASON FOR THAT WHY NOT BE FRANK ABOUT IT
2825-6391-0050 THE TRUE REASON IS THAT I HAVE MODELLED HER ON MY FIRST LOVE HOW WE A BAND OF TALLISH SCHOOLBOYS THE CHUMS OF HER TWO BROTHERS
2825-6391-0051 JUST OUT OF THE SCHOOLROOM HERSELF AS THE STANDARD BEARER OF A FAITH TO WHICH WE ALL WERE BORN BUT WHICH SHE ALONE KNEW HOW TO HOLD ALOFT WITH AN UNFLINCHING HOPE SHE HAD PERHAPS MORE GLOW AND LESS SERENITY IN HER SOUL THAN ANTONIA
2825-6391-0052 BUT SHE WAS AN UNCOMPROMISING PURITAN OF PATRIOTISM WITH NO TAINT OF THE SLIGHTEST WORLDLINESS IN HER THOUGHTS I WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE IN LOVE WITH HER BUT IT WAS I WHO HAD TO HEAR OFTENEST HER SCATHING CRITICISM OF MY LEVITIES
2825-6391-0053 I RECEIVED A HAND SQUEEZE THAT MADE MY HEART LEAP AND SAW A TEAR THAT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY SHE WAS SOFTENED AT THE LAST
2825-6391-0054 WE WERE SUCH CHILDREN STILL THAT I WAS REALLY GOING AWAY FOR GOOD GOING VERY FAR AWAY EVEN AS FAR AS SULACO LYING UNKNOWN
2825-6391-0055 THAT'S WHY I LONG SOMETIMES FOR ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF THE BEAUTIFUL ANTONIA OR CAN IT BE THE OTHER MOVING IN THE DIMNESS OF THE GREAT CATHEDRAL SAYING A SHORT PRAYER AT THE
2825-6391-0056 WITH HER UPRIGHT CARRIAGE AND HER WHITE HEAD A RELIC OF THE PAST DISREGARDED BY MEN AWAITING IMPATIENTLY THE DAWNS OF OTHER NEW ERAS THE COMING OF MORE REVOLUTIONS BUT THIS IS THE IDLEST OF DREAMS
2825-6391-0057 FOR I DID UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY WELL AT THE TIME THAT THE MOMENT THE BREATH LEFT THE BODY OF THE MAGNIFICENT CAPATAZ THE MAN OF THE PEOPLE FREED AT LAST FROM THE TOILS OF LOVE AND WEALTH THERE WAS NOTHING MORE FOR ME TO DO
