4706-18009-0000 IMMEDIATELY AFTER BREAKFAST CAMP WAS STRUCK AND ACCOMPANIED BY A FEW OF THE WA KAMBA
4706-18009-0001 SOME THREE OR FOUR MILES FROM ITS NORTHERN BANK WE HAD NOT GONE VERY FAR BEFORE I CAUGHT SIGHT OF A FINE WATERBUCK AND SUCCESSFULLY BOWLED HIM OVER A GOOD OMEN FOR THE DAY WHICH PUT US ALL IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS
4706-18009-0002 MABRUKI CUT OFF SEVERAL STRIPS OF THE TOUGH MEAT AND IMPALED THEM ON A SHARP STICK TO DRY IN THE SUN AS HE WENT ALONG I WARNED HIM THAT HE HAD BETTER BE CAREFUL THAT A LION DID NOT SCENT THE MEAT AS IF IT DID IT WOULD BE SURE TO FOLLOW UP AND KILL HIM
4706-18009-0003 OF COURSE I DID NOT MEAN THIS SERIOUSLY BUT MABRUKI WAS A GREAT GLUTTON AND BY NO MEANS COURAGEOUS SO I WANTED TO FRIGHTEN HIM AS WE TRUDGED ALONG TOWARDS THE HILL
4706-18009-0004 AND ON LOOKING OVER THE CREST I WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE TWO BEAUTIFUL GIRAFFE FEEDING PEACEFULLY A LITTLE DISTANCE AWAY AND STRAINING THEIR LONG NECKS TO GET AT THE TOPS OF SOME MIMOSA LIKE TREES WHILE A YOUNG ONE WAS LYING DOWN IN THE GRASS QUITE CLOSE TO ME
4706-18009-0005 FOR SOME TIME I REMAINED CONCEALED WATCHING THE FULL GROWN PAIR WITH GREAT INTEREST THEY HAD EVIDENTLY JUST COME UP FROM THE RIVER AND WERE SLOWLY MAKING THEIR WAY BACK TO THEIR HOME ON THE ESCARPMENT
4706-18009-0006 THEY SEEMED ON THE MOST AFFECTIONATE TERMS OCCASIONALLY ENTWINING THEIR GREAT LONG NECKS AND GENTLY BITING EACH OTHER ON THE SHOULDERS MUCH AS I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE ADDED A GIRAFFE TO MY COLLECTION OF TROPHIES I LEFT THEM UNDISTURBED
4706-18009-0007 AS I THINK IT A PITY TO SHOOT THESE RATHER RARE AND VERY HARMLESS CREATURES UNLESS ONE IS REQUIRED FOR A SPECIAL PURPOSE
4706-18009-0008 WE PUSHED ON ACCORDINGLY TOWARDS THE ESCARPMENT FOR I WAS VERY IMPATIENT TO GET TO THE TOP AND EXPLORE A PLACE WHERE I FELT CONVINCED NO OTHER WHITE MAN HAD EVER SET FOOT
4706-18009-0009 AND OF COURSE THE INEVITABLE WAIT A BIT THORNS I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH HOWEVER TO FIND A RHINO PATH WHICH AFFORDED A FAIRLY COMFORTABLE AND OPEN ROAD ON WHICH WE COULD WALK UPRIGHT THE GREATER PART OF THE WAY
4706-18009-0010 THE CLIMB UP THE ESCARPMENT ITSELF WAS A STIFF ONE AND HAD TO BE NEGOTIATED PRINCIPALLY ON ALL FOURS BUT ON THE WAY UP I DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS CLEFT SOME MILES TO THE RIGHT WHICH WOULD PROBABLY HAVE AFFORDED AN EASIER ASCENT
4706-18009-0011 I HAD NOT TIME TO EXPLORE IT ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY BUT I MADE A MENTAL NOTE TO DO SO ON SOME FUTURE OCCASION AFTER A TWO HOURS JOURNEY FROM THE RIVER WE SAT PANTING ON THE SUMMIT AFTER OUR SCRAMBLE
4706-18009-0012 AND SURVEYED THE VALLEY OF THE TSAVO WHICH LAY SPREAD OUT LIKE A MAP ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW US OUR HOME TENTS THE BRIDGE TSAVO STATION AND OTHER BUILDINGS WERE PLAINLY VISIBLE
4706-18009-0013 AND THE RAILWAY ITSELF LIKE A SHINING SNAKE COULD BE SEEN FOR MANY MILES WINDING ITS WAY THROUGH THE PARCHED WILDERNESS
4706-18009-0014 HERE I FOUND THE SAME KIND OF NYIKA AS THAT ROUND TSAVO THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING THAT THERE WERE MORE GREEN TREES ABOUT THE COUNTRY MOREOVER WAS SOMEWHAT MORE OPEN AND WAS INTERSECTED BY HUNDREDS OF BROAD AND WELL BEATEN ANIMAL PATHS
4706-18009-0015 ALONG WHICH WE COULD WALK UPRIGHT IN COMFORT I WAS LEADING THE WAY FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY MAHINA AND MABRUKI WHEN SUDDENLY WE ALMOST WALKED UPON A LION WHICH WAS LYING DOWN AT THE SIDE OF THE PATH AND WHICH HAD PROBABLY BEEN ASLEEP
4706-18009-0016 IT GAVE A FIERCE GROWL AND AT ONCE BOUNDED OFF THROUGH THE BUSH BUT TO MABRUKI WHO DOUBTLESS RECALLED THEN THE WARNING I HAD GIVEN HIM IN FUN EARLIER IN THE DAY
4706-18009-0017 THE INCIDENT APPEARED SO ALARMING THAT HE FLUNG DOWN HIS STICK LOAD OF MEAT AND FLED FOR HIS LIFE
4706-18009-0018 EVEN THE USUALLY SILENT WA KAMBA JOINING IN THE GENERAL LAUGHTER AS THEY SCRAMBLED FOR THE DISCARDED MEAT WE SAW NOTHING MORE OF THE LION THOUGH A FEW STEPS FURTHER ON BROUGHT US TO THE REMAINS OF A ZEBRA WHICH HE HAD RECENTLY KILLED AND FEASTED ON
4706-18009-0019 BUT AFTER THIS MABRUKI KEPT CAREFULLY IN THE REAR CURIOUSLY ENOUGH ONLY A SHORT WHILE LATER WE HAD AN EXACTLY SIMILAR ADVENTURE WITH A RHINO AS OWING TO THE TORTUOUS NATURE OF THE PATH WE WALKED RIGHT INTO IT BEFORE WE WERE AWARE
4706-18009-0020 LIKE THE LION HOWEVER IT WAS MORE FRIGHTENED THAN WE AND CHARGED AWAY FROM US THROUGH THE JUNGLE FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS WE PURSUED OUR JOURNEY INTO THE PLATEAU AND SAW AND HEARD A WONDERFUL VARIETY OF GAME INCLUDING GIRAFFE RHINO
4706-18009-0021 BUSH BUCK THE LESSER KUDU ZEBRA WART HOG BABOONS AND MONKEYS AND ANY NUMBER OF PAA THE LAST BEING OF A REDDER COLOUR THAN THOSE OF THE TSAVO VALLEY OF NATIVES OR OF HUMAN HABITATIONS HOWEVER
4706-18009-0022 WE SAW NO SIGNS AND INDEED THE WHOLE REGION WAS SO DRY AND WATERLESS AS TO BE QUITE UNINHABITABLE THE ANIMALS THAT REQUIRE WATER HAVE TO MAKE A NIGHTLY JOURNEY TO AND FROM THE SABAKI
4706-18009-0023 WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THE THOUSANDS OF ANIMAL PATHS LEADING FROM THE PLATEAU TO THE RIVER BY THIS TIME WE WERE ALL BEGINNING TO FEEL VERY TIRED AND THE BHISTI'S STOCK OF WATER WAS RUNNING LOW
4706-18009-0024 I THEREFORE CLIMBED THE HIGHEST TREE I COULD FIND IN ORDER TO HAVE A GOOD LOOK ROUND BUT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING COULD I SEE IN ANY DIRECTION BUT THE SAME FLAT THORNY WILDERNESS INTERSPERSED HERE AND THERE WITH A FEW GREEN TREES
4706-18009-0025 A MOST HOPELESS TERRIBLE PLACE SHOULD ONE BE LOST IN IT WITH CERTAIN DEATH EITHER BY THIRST OR BY SAVAGE BEASTS STARING ONE IN THE FACE
4706-18009-0026 CLEARLY THEN THE ONLY THING TO DO WAS TO RETURN TO THE RIVER AND IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BEFORE DARK IT WAS NECESSARY THAT NO TIME SHOULD BE LOST
4706-18009-0027 BUT WE HAD BEEN WINDING IN AND OUT SO MUCH THROUGH THE ANIMAL PATHS THAT IT WAS NO EASY MATTER TO SAY IN WHICH DIRECTION THE SABAKI LAY FIRST I CONSULTED MY WA KAMBA FOLLOWERS AS TO THE ROUTE BACK THEY SIMPLY SHOOK THEIR HEADS
4706-18009-0028 THEN I ASKED MAHINA WHO POINTED OUT A DIRECTION EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO THAT WHICH I FELT CONFIDENT WAS THE RIGHT ONE MABRUKI OF COURSE KNEW NOTHING BUT VOLUNTEERED THE HELPFUL AND CHEERING INFORMATION THAT WE WERE LOST AND WOULD ALL BE KILLED BY LIONS
4706-18009-0029 IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I CONFIRMED MY OWN IDEA AS TO OUR WAY BY COMPARING MY WATCH AND THE SUN AND GAVE THE ORDER TO START AT ONCE
4706-18009-0030 MABRUKI MURMURED LOUDLY EVEN MAHINA EXPRESSED GRAVE DOUBTS AS TO WHETHER THE SAHIB HAD TAKEN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ONLY THE WA KAMBA STALKED ALONG IN REASSURING SILENCE
4706-18009-0031 FOR SOME TIME WE HAD BEEN FOLLOWING A BROAD WHITE RHINO PATH AND THE GREAT FOOTMARKS OF ONE OF THESE BEASTS WERE FRESH AND PLAINLY VISIBLE IN THE DUST HE HAD BEEN TRAVELLING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO US
4706-18009-0032 AND I FELT SURE THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN RETURNING FROM DRINKING IN THE RIVER I ACCORDINGLY INSISTED ON OUR KEEPING TO THIS PATH AND VERY SOON TO MY GREAT RELIEF WE FOUND THAT WE WERE AT THE EDGE OF THE ESCARPMENT A COUPLE OF MILES AWAY FROM THE PLACE WHERE WE HAD MADE THE ASCENT
4706-18009-0033 HERE A HALT WAS CALLED A SHEET WAS SPREAD OVER SOME OF THE STUNTED TREES AND UNDER ITS SHADE WE RESTED FOR HALF AN HOUR HAD SOME FOOD AND DRANK THE LAST OF OUR WATER AFTER THIS WE PUSHED ON WITH RENEWED VIGOUR
4706-18009-0034 AND ARRIVED AT THE SABAKI IN GOOD TIME BEFORE SUNDOWN HAVING BAGGED A COUPLE OF GUINEA FOWL AND A PAA ON THE WAY TO SERVE FOR DINNER AFTER THE LONG AND FATIGUING DAY MY BATHE IN A CLEAR SHADY POOL WAS A REAL DELIGHT
4706-18009-0035 BUT I MIGHT NOT HAVE ENJOYED IT QUITE SO MUCH IF I HAD KNOWN THEN OF THE TERRIBLE FATE WHICH AWAITED ONE OF MY FOLLOWERS IN THE SAME RIVER THE NEXT DAY BY THE TIME I GOT BACK TO CAMP SUPPER WAS READY AND FULLY APPRECIATED
4706-18009-0036 THE TIRELESS MAHINA HAD ALSO COLLECTED SOME DRY GRASS FOR MY BED AND I TURNED IN AT ONCE WITH MY RIFLE HANDY AND SLEPT THE SLEEP OF THE JUST REGARDLESS OF ALL THE WILD BEASTS IN AFRICA
4706-18009-0037 AT DAWN MABRUKI ROUSED ME WITH A CUP OF STEAMING HOT COFFEE AND SOME BISCUITS AND A START WAS AT ONCE MADE ON OUR RETURN JOURNEY TO TSAVO THE PLACE WHERE WE HAD STRUCK THE SABAKI THE PREVIOUS EVENING
4706-18009-0038 WAS SOME MILES FURTHER DOWN THE STREAM THAN I HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE SO I DECIDED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE MASAI TRAIL ALONG ITS BANK UNTIL THE TSAVO RIVER WAS REACHED I DID NOT THINK WE SHOULD MEET WITH ANY FURTHER ADVENTURE ON OUR WAY HOME
4706-18009-0039 BUT IN THE WILDS THE UNEXPECTED IS ALWAYS HAPPENING SHORTLY AFTER WE STARTED ONE OF THE WA KAMBA WENT DOWN TO THE RIVER'S EDGE TO FILL HIS CALABASH WITH WATER WHEN A CROCODILE SUDDENLY ROSE UP OUT OF THE STREAM SEIZED THE POOR FELLOW AND IN A MOMENT HAD DRAGGED HIM IN
4706-18009-0040 BUT ON HEARING THE CRIES OF THE OTHERS I RAN BACK AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TOO LATE HOWEVER TO SEE ANY SIGN OF EITHER CROCODILE OR NATIVE MAHINA PHILOSOPHICALLY REMARKED THAT AFTER ALL IT WAS ONLY A WASHENZI SAVAGE
4706-18009-0041 WHOSE LOSS DID NOT MUCH MATTER AND THE OTHER THREE WA KAMBA CERTAINLY DID NOT APPEAR TO BE AFFECTED BY THE INCIDENT BUT CALMLY POSSESSED THEMSELVES OF THEIR DEAD COMPANION'S BOW AND QUIVER OF POISONED ARROWS AND OF THE STOCK OF MEAT WHICH HE HAD LEFT ON THE BANK
4706-18009-0042 I HAVE SINCE LEARNED THAT ACCIDENTS OF THIS KIND ARE OF FAIRLY FREQUENT OCCURRENCE ALONG THE BANKS OF THESE RIVERS ON ONE OCCASION WHILE I WAS IN THE COUNTRY A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A VERY LUCKY ESCAPE
4706-18009-0043 HE WAS FILLING HIS WATER BOTTLE AT THE RIVER WHEN ONE OF THESE BRUTES CAUGHT HIM BY THE HAND AND ATTEMPTED TO DRAW HIM IN FORTUNATELY ONE OF HIS SERVANTS RUSHED TO HIS ASSISTANCE AND MANAGED TO PULL HIM OUT OF THE CROCODILE'S CLUTCHES WITH THE LOSS ONLY OF TWO OF HIS FINGERS
4706-18009-0044 AS WE MADE OUR WAY UP THE SABAKI WE DISCOVERED A BEAUTIFUL WATERFALL ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET HIGH NOT A SHEER DROP BUT A SERIES OF CASCADES
4706-18009-0045 AT THIS TIME THE RIVER WAS IN LOW WATER AND THE FALLS CONSEQUENTLY DID NOT LOOK THEIR BEST BUT IN FLOOD TIME THEY FORM A FINE SIGHT AND THE THUNDER OF THE FALLING WATER CAN THEN BE PLAINLY HEARD AT TSAVO OVER SEVEN MILES AWAY WHEN THE WIND IS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
