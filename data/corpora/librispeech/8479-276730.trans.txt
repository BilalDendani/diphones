8479-276730-0000 SENATOR DOUGLAS'S PROPOSITION TO EVACUATE THE FORTS AND EXTRACTS FROM HIS SPEECH IN SUPPORT OF IT GENERAL SCOTT'S ADVICE
8479-276730-0001 PROTESTING AGAINST THE ACTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MISSTATEMENTS OF THE COUNT OF PARIS CORRESPONDENCE RELATIVE TO PROPOSED EVACUATION OF THE FORT A CRISIS
8479-276730-0002 THE COURSE PURSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES WITH REGARD TO THE FORTS HAD NOT PASSED WITHOUT EARNEST REMONSTRANCE FROM THE MOST INTELLIGENT AND PATRIOTIC OF ITS OWN FRIENDS DURING THE PERIOD OF THE EVENTS
8479-276730-0003 WHICH CONSTITUTE THE SUBJECT OF THE PRECEDING CHAPTER IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH CONTINUED IN EXECUTIVE SESSION FOR SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER THE INAUGURATION OF MISTER LINCOLN IT WAS THE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION
8479-276730-0004 MISTER DOUGLAS OF ILLINOIS WHO WAS CERTAINLY NOT SUSPECTED OF SYMPATHY WITH SECESSION
8479-276730-0005 ON THE FIFTEENTH OF MARCH OFFERED A RESOLUTION RECOMMENDING THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE GARRISONS FROM ALL FORTS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE STATES WHICH HAD SECEDED EXCEPT THOSE AT KEY WEST AND THE DRY TORTUGAS IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION HE SAID
8479-276730-0006 MUCH LESS THE RECAPTURING OF THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN TAKEN UNLESS WE INTEND TO REDUCE THOSE STATES THEMSELVES INTO SUBJECTION I TAKE IT FOR GRANTED NO MAN WILL DENY THE PROPOSITION
8479-276730-0007 THAT WHOEVER PERMANENTLY HOLDS CHARLESTON AND SOUTH CAROLINA IS ENTITLED TO THE POSSESSION OF FORT SUMTER WHOEVER PERMANENTLY HOLDS PENSACOLA AND FLORIDA IS ENTITLED TO THE POSSESSION OF FORT PICKENS
8479-276730-0008 WHOEVER HOLDS THE STATES IN WHOSE LIMITS THOSE FORTS ARE PLACED IS ENTITLED TO THE FORTS THEMSELVES UNLESS THERE IS SOMETHING PECULIAR IN THE LOCATION OF SOME PARTICULAR FORT
8479-276730-0009 THAT MAKES IT IMPORTANT FOR US TO HOLD IT FOR THE GENERAL DEFENSE OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY ITS COMMERCE AND INTERESTS INSTEAD OF BEING USEFUL ONLY FOR THE DEFENSE OF A PARTICULAR CITY OR LOCALITY IT IS TRUE THAT FORTS TAYLOR AND JEFFERSON
8479-276730-0010 AT KEY WEST AND TORTUGAS ARE SO SITUATED AS TO BE ESSENTIALLY NATIONAL
8479-276730-0011 NOT SO WITH MOULTRIE JOHNSON CASTLE PINCKNEY AND SUMTER IN CHARLESTON HARBOR NOT SO WITH PULASKI ON THE SAVANNAH RIVER NOT SO WITH MORGAN AND OTHER FORTS IN ALABAMA
8479-276730-0012 NOT SO WITH THOSE OTHER FORTS THAT WERE INTENDED TO GUARD THE ENTRANCE OF A PARTICULAR HARBOR FOR LOCAL DEFENSE WE CAN NOT DENY THAT THERE IS A SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY DE FACTO IN EXISTENCE WITH ITS CAPITAL AT MONTGOMERY
8479-276730-0013 WE MAY REGRET IT I REGRET IT MOST PROFOUNDLY BUT I CAN NOT DENY THE TRUTH OF THE FACT PAINFUL AND MORTIFYING AS IT IS I PROCLAIM BOLDLY THE POLICY OF THOSE WITH WHOM I ACT WE ARE FOR PEACE
8479-276730-0014 MISTER DOUGLAS IN URGING THE MAINTENANCE OF PEACE AS A MOTIVE FOR THE EVACUATION OF THE FORTS WAS NO DOUBT AWARE OF THE FULL FORCE OF HIS WORDS HE KNEW THAT THEIR CONTINUED OCCUPATION WAS VIRTUALLY
8479-276730-0015 A DECLARATION OF WAR THE GENERAL IN CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY ALSO IT IS WELL KNOWN URGENTLY ADVISED THE EVACUATION OF THE FORTS
8479-276730-0016 BUT THE MOST STRIKING PROTEST AGAINST THE COERCIVE MEASURES FINALLY ADOPTED WAS THAT OF MAJOR ANDERSON HIMSELF THE LETTER IN WHICH HIS VIEWS WERE EXPRESSED HAS BEEN CAREFULLY SUPPRESSED IN THE PARTISAN NARRATIVES OF THAT PERIOD AND WELLNIGH LOST SIGHT OF
8479-276730-0017 AT VARIOUS POINTS ON MORRIS ISLAND AND THE VIGOROUS PROSECUTION OF IT THIS MORNING APPARENTLY STRENGTHENING ALL THE BATTERIES WHICH ARE UNDER THE FIRE OF OUR GUNS SHOWS THAT THEY
8479-276730-0018 I AM PREPARING BY THE SIDE OF MY BARBETTE GUNS PROTECTION FOR OUR MEN FROM THE SHELLS WHICH WILL BE ALMOST CONTINUALLY BURSTING OVER OR IN OUR WORK I HAD THE HONOR TO RECEIVE BY YESTERDAY'S MAIL
8479-276730-0019 THE LETTER OF THE HONORABLE SECRETARY OF WAR DATED APRIL FOURTH AND CONFESS THAT WHAT HE THERE STATES SURPRISES ME VERY GREATLY FOLLOWING AS IT DOES AND CONTRADICTING SO POSITIVELY
8479-276730-0020 THE ASSURANCE MISTER CRAWFORD TELEGRAPHED HE WAS AUTHORIZED TO MAKE I TRUST THAT THIS MATTER WILL BE AT ONCE PUT IN A CORRECT LIGHT AS A MOVEMENT MADE NOW WHEN THE SOUTH HAS BEEN ERRONEOUSLY INFORMED THAT NONE SUCH WOULD BE ATTEMPTED
8479-276730-0021 WOULD PRODUCE MOST DISASTROUS RESULTS THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY IT IS OF COURSE NOW TOO LATE FOR ME TO GIVE ANY ADVICE IN REFERENCE TO THE PROPOSED SCHEME OF CAPTAIN FOX I FEAR THAT ITS RESULT
8479-276730-0022 CAN NOT FAIL TO BE DISASTROUS TO ALL CONCERNED EVEN WITH HIS BOAT AT OUR WALLS THE LOSS OF LIFE AS I THINK I MENTIONED TO MISTER FOX IN UNLOADING HER WILL MORE THAN PAY FOR THE GOOD TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE EXPEDITION
8479-276730-0023 WHICH KEEPS US IF I CAN MAINTAIN POSSESSION OF THIS WORK OUT OF POSITION SURROUNDED BY STRONG WORKS WHICH MUST BE CARRIED TO MAKE THIS FORT OF THE LEAST VALUE

8479-276730-0029 THESE FACTS BECAME KNOWN TO THE CONFEDERATE GOVERNMENT AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT NO TIME WAS TO BE LOST IN PREPARING FOR AND IF POSSIBLE ANTICIPATING THE IMPENDING ASSAULT THE CHARACTER OF THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN

8479-276730-0059 SIR BY AUTHORITY OF BRIGADIER GENERAL BEAUREGARD COMMANDING THE PROVISIONAL FORCES OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES

8479-276730-0065 INTRODUCE THE SUPPLIES WOULD COMPEL THE OPENING OF FIRE UPON THE VESSELS BEARING THEM UNDER THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES THEREBY RELEASING MAJOR ANDERSON FROM HIS PLEDGE IT IS EVIDENT THAT HIS CONDITIONS COULD NOT BE ACCEPTED
8479-276730-0066 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MERELY AFTER THE AVOWAL OF A HOSTILE DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO AWAIT AN INEVITABLE CONFLICT WITH THE GUNS OF FORT SUMTER
8479-276730-0067 WITH NO POSSIBLE HOPE OF AVERTING IT UNLESS IN THE IMPROBABLE EVENT OF A DELAY OF THE EXPECTED FLEET FOR NEARLY FOUR DAYS LONGER IN POINT OF FACT IT ARRIVED OFF THE HARBOR ON THE SAME DAY
8479-276730-0068 BUT WAS HINDERED BY A GALE OF WIND FROM ENTERING IT THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY NO OTHER COURSE TO BE PURSUED THAN THAT ANNOUNCED IN THE ANSWER GIVEN BY GENERAL BEAUREGARD IT SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT
8479-276730-0069 THE ATTITUDE OF WHICH WAS AT LEAST OFFENSIVE NO RESTRICTION HAD BEEN PUT UPON THEIR PRIVILEGE OF PURCHASING IN CHARLESTON FRESH PROVISIONS
