7649-96682-0000 SLEEP AND REST WENT FROM HIM
7649-96682-0001 THE SHRINE OF APOLLO TO BE PURIFIED OF HIS CRIME
7649-96682-0002 THOU SHALT GO TO EURYSTHEUS THY COUSIN IN MYCENAE AND SERVE HIM IN ALL THINGS WHEN THE LABORS HE SHALL LAY UPON THEE ARE ACCOMPLISHED AND WHEN THE REST OF THY LIFE IS LIVED OUT THOU SHALT BECOME ONE OF THE IMMORTALS
7649-96682-0003 HERACLES ON HEARING THESE WORDS SET OUT FOR MYCENAE HE STOOD BEFORE HIS COUSIN WHO HATED HIM HE A TOWERING MAN STOOD BEFORE A KING WHO SAT THERE WEAK AND TREMBLING AND HERACLES SAID
7649-96682-0004 I HAVE COME TO TAKE UP THE LABORS THAT YOU WILL LAY UPON ME SPEAK NOW EURYSTHEUS AND TELL ME WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE ME DO EURYSTHEUS THAT WEAK KING LOOKING ON THE YOUNG MAN WHO STOOD AS TALL
7649-96682-0005 AND AS FIRM AS ONE OF THE IMMORTALS HAD A HEART THAT WAS FILLED WITH HATRED HE LIFTED UP HIS HEAD AND HE SAID WITH A FROWN THERE IS A LION IN NEMEA THAT IS STRONGER AND MORE FIERCE THAN ANY LION KNOWN BEFORE KILL THAT LION
7649-96682-0006 AND BRING THE LION'S SKIN TO ME THAT I MAY KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TRULY PERFORMED YOUR TASK SO EURYSTHEUS SAID AND HERACLES WITH NEITHER SHIELD NOR ARMS WENT FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE TO SEEK AND TO COMBAT THE DREAD LION OF NEMEA
7649-96682-0007 HE WENT ON UNTIL HE CAME INTO A COUNTRY WHERE THE FENCES WERE OVERTHROWN AND THE FIELDS WASTED AND THE HOUSES EMPTY AND FALLEN HE WENT ON UNTIL HE CAME TO THE WASTE AROUND THAT LAND
7649-96682-0008 THERE HE CAME ON THE TRAIL OF THE LION IT LED UP THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN AND HERACLES WITHOUT SHIELD OR ARMS FOLLOWED THE TRAIL HE HEARD THE ROAR OF THE LION LOOKING UP HE SAW THE BEAST STANDING AT THE MOUTH OF A CAVERN
7649-96682-0009 HUGE AND DARK AGAINST THE SUNSET THE LION ROARED THREE TIMES AND THEN IT WENT WITHIN THE CAVERN AROUND THE MOUTH WERE STREWN THE BONES OF CREATURES IT HAD KILLED AND CARRIED THERE HERACLES LOOKED UPON THEM WHEN HE CAME TO THE CAVERN
7649-96682-0010 HE WENT WITHIN FAR INTO THE CAVERN HE WENT AND THEN HE CAME TO WHERE HE SAW THE LION IT WAS SLEEPING HERACLES VIEWED THE TERRIBLE BULK OF THE LION AND THEN HE LOOKED UPON HIS OWN KNOTTED HANDS AND ARMS
7649-96682-0011 MEASURING HIS STRENGTH AND THE SIZE OF THE LION THE BREATH FROM ITS MOUTH AND NOSTRILS CAME HEAVILY TO HIM AS THE BEAST SLEPT GORGED WITH ITS PREY THEN THE LION YAWNED HERACLES SPRANG ON IT
7649-96682-0012 AND PUT HIS GREAT HANDS UPON ITS THROAT NO GROWL CAME OUT OF ITS MOUTH BUT THE GREAT EYES BLAZED WHILE THE TERRIBLE PAWS TORE AT HERACLES AGAINST THE ROCK HERACLES HELD THE BEAST STRONGLY HE HELD IT CHOKING IT THROUGH THE SKIN THAT WAS ALMOST IMPENETRABLE
7649-96682-0013 TERRIBLY THE LION STRUGGLED BUT THE STRONG HANDS OF THE HERO HELD AROUND ITS THROAT UNTIL IT STRUGGLED NO MORE THEN HERACLES STRIPPED OFF THAT IMPENETRABLE SKIN FROM THE LION'S BODY HE PUT IT UPON HIMSELF FOR A CLOAK
7649-96682-0014 THEN AS HE WENT THROUGH THE FOREST HE PULLED UP A YOUNG OAK TREE AND TRIMMED IT AND MADE A CLUB FOR HIMSELF WITH THE LION'S SKIN OVER HIM THAT SKIN THAT NO SPEAR OR ARROW COULD PIERCE
7649-96682-0015 AND CARRYING THE CLUB IN HIS HAND HE JOURNEYED ON UNTIL HE CAME TO THE PALACE OF KING EURYSTHEUS THE KING SEEING COMING TOWARD HIM A TOWERING MAN ALL COVERED WITH THE HIDE OF A MONSTROUS LION RAN AND HID HIMSELF IN A GREAT JAR
7649-96682-0016 HE WOULD NOT SPEAK WITH HERACLES NOR HAVE HIM COME NEAR HIM SO FEARFUL WAS HE BUT HERACLES WAS CONTENT TO BE LEFT ALONE HE SAT DOWN IN THE PALACE AND FEASTED HIMSELF THE SERVANTS CAME TO THE KING
7649-96682-0017 HE ISSUED COMMANDS THROUGH HIS HERALDS ORDERING HERACLES TO GO FORTH AT ONCE AND PERFORM THE SECOND OF HIS TASKS IT WAS TO SLAY THE GREAT WATER SNAKE THAT MADE ITS LAIR IN THE SWAMPS OF LERNA
7649-96682-0018 HERACLES STAYED TO FEAST ANOTHER DAY AND THEN WITH THE LION'S SKIN ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS AND THE GREAT CLUB IN HIS HANDS HE STARTED OFF BUT THIS TIME HE DID NOT GO ALONE THE BOY IOLAUS WENT WITH HIM
7649-96682-0019 HERACLES AND IOLAUS WENT ON UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE VAST SWAMP OF LERNA RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SWAMP WAS THE WATER SNAKE THAT WAS CALLED THE HYDRA NINE HEADS IT HAD
7649-96682-0020 AND IT RAISED THEM UP OUT OF THE WATER AS THE HERO AND HIS COMPANION CAME NEAR THEY COULD NOT CROSS THE SWAMP TO COME TO THE MONSTER FOR MAN OR BEAST WOULD SINK AND BE LOST IN IT THE HYDRA REMAINED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SWAMP
7649-96682-0021 AS THE HYDRA CAME NEAR HE KNOCKED HEAD AFTER HEAD OFF ITS BODY BUT FOR EVERY HEAD KNOCKED OFF TWO GREW UPON THE HYDRA AND AS HE STRUGGLED WITH THE MONSTER A HUGE CRAB CAME OUT OF THE SWAMP
7649-96682-0022 THEN HERACLES CRIED OUT THE BOY IOLAUS CAME HE KILLED THE CRAB THAT HAD COME TO THE HYDRA'S AID THEN HERACLES LAID HANDS UPON THE HYDRA AND DREW IT OUT OF THE SWAMP WITH HIS CLUB HE KNOCKED OFF A HEAD
7649-96682-0023 AND HE HAD IOLAUS PUT FIRE TO WHERE IT HAD BEEN SO THAT TWO HEADS MIGHT NOT GROW IN THAT PLACE THE LIFE OF THE HYDRA WAS IN ITS MIDDLE HEAD THAT HEAD HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO KNOCK OFF WITH HIS CLUB
7649-96682-0024 HERACLES DIPPED HIS ARROWS INTO THE GALL OF THE MONSTER MAKING HIS ARROWS DEADLY NO THING THAT WAS STRUCK BY THESE ARROWS AFTERWARD COULD KEEP ITS LIFE AGAIN HE CAME TO EURYSTHEUS'S PALACE
7649-96682-0025 AND EURYSTHEUS SEEING HIM RAN AGAIN AND HID HIMSELF IN THE JAR
7649-96682-0026 THAT HE HAD RETURNED AND THAT THE SECOND LABOR WAS ACCOMPLISHED EURYSTHEUS HEARING FROM THE SERVANTS THAT HERACLES WAS MILD IN HIS WAYS CAME OUT OF THE JAR INSOLENTLY HE SPOKE
7649-96682-0027 BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT THE CRIME THAT HE HAD COMMITTED IN HIS MADNESS WOULD HAVE TO BE EXPIATED BY LABORS PERFORMED AT THE ORDER OF THIS MAN HE LOOKED FULL UPON EURYSTHEUS AND HE SAID TELL ME OF THE OTHER LABORS
7649-96682-0028 AND I WILL GO FORTH FROM MYCENAE AND ACCOMPLISH THEM THEN EURYSTHEUS BADE HIM GO AND MAKE CLEAN THE STABLES OF KING AUGEIAS HERACLES CAME INTO THAT KING'S COUNTRY
7649-96682-0029 THE SMELL FROM THE STABLES WAS FELT FOR MILES AROUND COUNTLESS HERDS OF CATTLE AND GOATS HAD BEEN IN THE STABLES FOR YEARS AND BECAUSE OF THE UNCLEANNESS AND THE SMELL THAT CAME FROM IT THE CROPS WERE WITHERED ALL AROUND
7649-96682-0030 HERACLES TOLD THE KING THAT HE WOULD CLEAN THE STABLES IF HE WERE GIVEN ONE TENTH OF THE CATTLE AND THE GOATS FOR A REWARD THE KING AGREED TO THIS REWARD
7649-96682-0031 AND IN A DAY ALL THE UNCLEANNESS WAS WASHED AWAY THEN HERACLES TURNED THE RIVERS BACK INTO THEIR OWN COURSES HE WAS NOT GIVEN THE REWARD HE HAD BARGAINED FOR HOWEVER
7649-96682-0032 HE WENT BACK TO MYCENAE WITH THE TALE OF HOW HE HAD CLEANED THE STABLES TEN LABORS REMAIN FOR ME TO DO NOW HE SAID ELEVEN SAID EURYSTHEUS
7649-96682-0033 HOW CAN I ALLOW THE CLEANING OF KING AUGEIAS'S STABLES TO YOU WHEN YOU BARGAINED FOR A REWARD FOR DOING IT THEN WHILE HERACLES STOOD STILL HOLDING HIMSELF BACK FROM STRIKING HIM EURYSTHEUS RAN AWAY AND HID HIMSELF IN THE JAR
