6550-53343-0000 AND BIRDS HAD DRAWN THEIR VALENTINES THE JEALOUS TROUT THAT LOW DID LIE ROSE AT A WELL DISSEMBLED FLIE THERE STOOD MY FRIEND WITH PATIENT SKILL ATTENDING OF HIS TREMBLING QUILL
6550-53343-0001 SIR H WOTTON IT IS SAID THAT MANY AN UNLUCKY URCHIN IS INDUCED TO RUN AWAY FROM HIS FAMILY AND BETAKE HIMSELF TO A SEAFARING LIFE
6550-53343-0002 BUT AS SOON AS THE WEATHER WAS AUSPICIOUS AND THAT THE SPRING BEGAN TO MELT INTO THE VERGE OF SUMMER WE TOOK ROD IN HAND AND SALLIED INTO THE COUNTRY AS STARK MAD AS WAS EVER DON QUIXOTE FROM READING BOOKS OF CHIVALRY
6550-53343-0003 BEING ATTIRED CAP A PIE FOR THE ENTERPRISE HE WORE A BROAD SKIRTED FUSTIAN COAT PERPLEXED WITH HALF A HUNDRED POCKETS A PAIR OF STOUT SHOES AND LEATHERN GAITERS A BASKET SLUNG ON ONE SIDE FOR FISH
6550-53343-0004 A PATENT ROD A LANDING NET AND A SCORE OF OTHER INCONVENIENCES ONLY TO BE FOUND IN THE TRUE ANGLER'S ARMORY THUS HARNESSED FOR THE FIELD HE WAS AS GREAT A MATTER OF STARE AND WONDERMENT AMONG THE COUNTRY FOLK
6550-53343-0005 WHO HAD NEVER SEEN A REGULAR ANGLER AS WAS THE STEEL CLAD HERO OF LA MANCHA AMONG THE GOATHERDS OF THE SIERRA MORENA OUR FIRST ESSAY WAS ALONG A MOUNTAIN BROOK AMONG THE HIGHLANDS OF THE HUDSON
6550-53343-0006 A MOST UNFORTUNATE PLACE FOR THE EXECUTION OF THOSE PISCATORY TACTICS WHICH HAD BEEN INVENTED ALONG THE VELVET MARGINS OF QUIET ENGLISH RIVULETS IT WAS ONE OF THOSE WILD STREAMS THAT LAVISH AMONG OUR ROMANTIC SOLITUDES
6550-53343-0007 UNHEEDED BEAUTIES ENOUGH TO FILL THE SKETCH BOOK OF A HUNTER OF THE PICTURESQUE SOMETIMES IT WOULD LEAP DOWN ROCKY SHELVES MAKING SMALL CASCADES OVER WHICH THE TREES THREW THEIR BROAD BALANCING SPRAYS AND LONG NAMELESS WEEDS
6550-53343-0008 WOULD STEAL FORTH INTO OPEN DAY WITH THE MOST PLACID DEMURE FACE IMAGINABLE AS I HAVE SEEN SOME PESTILENT SHREW OF A HOUSEWIFE AFTER FILLING HER HOME WITH UPROAR AND ILL HUMOR COME DIMPLING OUT OF DOORS SWIMMING AND CURTSEYING AND SMILING UPON ALL THE WORLD
6550-53343-0009 THAT ANGLING IS SOMETHING LIKE POETRY A MAN MUST BE BORN TO IT I HOOKED MYSELF INSTEAD OF THE FISH TANGLED MY LINE IN EVERY TREE LOST MY BAIT BROKE MY ROD UNTIL I GAVE UP THE ATTEMPT IN DESPAIR
6550-53343-0010 SATISFIED THAT IT WAS HIS FASCINATING VEIN OF HONEST SIMPLICITY AND RURAL FEELING THAT HAD BEWITCHED ME AND NOT THE PASSION FOR ANGLING MY COMPANIONS HOWEVER WERE MORE PERSEVERING IN THEIR DELUSION
6550-53343-0011 I HAVE THEM AT THIS MOMENT BEFORE EYES STEALING ALONG THE BORDER OF THE BROOK WHERE IT LAY OPEN TO THE DAY OR WAS MERELY FRINGED BY SHRUBS AND BUSHES I SEE THE BITTERN RISING WITH HOLLOW SCREAM AS THEY BREAK IN UPON HIS RARELY INVADED HAUNT
6550-53343-0012 THE KINGFISHER WATCHING THEM SUSPICIOUSLY FROM HIS DRY TREE THAT OVERHANGS THE DEEP BLACK MILLPOND IN THE GORGE OF THE HILLS THE TORTOISE LETTING HIMSELF SLIP SIDEWAYS FROM OFF THE STONE OR LOG ON WHICH HE IS SUNNING HIMSELF
6550-53343-0013 JUST BY A SPRING OF PURE SWEET WATER THAT STOLE OUT OF THE SIDE OF A HILL
6550-53343-0014 WHILE I LAY ON THE GRASS AND BUILT CASTLES IN A BRIGHT PILE OF CLOUDS UNTIL I FELL ASLEEP ALL THIS MAY APPEAR LIKE MERE EGOTISM YET I CANNOT REFRAIN FROM UTTERING THESE RECOLLECTIONS WHICH ARE PASSING LIKE A STRAIN OF MUSIC OVER MY MIND
6550-53343-0015 AND HAVE BEEN CALLED UP BY AN AGREEABLE SCENE WHICH I WITNESSED NOT LONG SINCE
6550-53343-0016 A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE STREAM WHICH FLOWS DOWN FROM THE WELSH HILLS AND THROWS ITSELF INTO THE DEE MY ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED TO A GROUP SEATED ON THE MARGIN ON APPROACHING I FOUND IT TO CONSIST
6550-53343-0017 HIS FACE BORE THE MARKS OF FORMER STORMS BUT PRESENT FAIR WEATHER ITS FURROWS HAD BEEN WORN INTO AN HABITUAL SMILE HIS IRON GRAY LOCKS HUNG ABOUT HIS EARS
6550-53343-0018 AND HE HAD ALTOGETHER THE GOOD HUMORED AIR OF A CONSTITUTIONAL PHILOSOPHER WHO WAS DISPOSED TO TAKE THE WORLD AS IT WENT ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS WAS A RAGGED WIGHT WITH THE SKULKING LOOK OF AN ARRANT POACHER
6550-53343-0019 AND I'LL WARRANT COULD FIND HIS WAY TO ANY GENTLEMAN'S FISH POND IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE DARKEST NIGHT THE OTHER WAS A TALL AWKWARD COUNTRY LAD WITH A LOUNGING GAIT AND APPARENTLY SOMEWHAT OF A RUSTIC BEAU THE OLD MAN WAS BUSY IN EXAMINING THE MAW OF A TROUT
6550-53343-0020 WHICH HE HAD JUST KILLED TO DISCOVER BY ITS CONTENTS WHAT INSECTS WERE SEASONABLE FOR BAIT AND WAS LECTURING ON THE SUBJECT TO HIS COMPANIONS WHO APPEARED TO LISTEN WITH INFINITE DEFERENCE I HAVE A KIND FEELING TOWARDS ALL
6550-53343-0021 IN WHICH ARE SET FORTH MANY OF THE MAXIMS OF THEIR INOFFENSIVE FRATERNITY TAKE GOOD HEDE SAYETH THIS
6550-53343-0022 THAT IN GOING ABOUT YOUR DISPORTES YE OPEN NO MAN'S GATES BUT THAT YE SHET THEM AGAIN ALSO YE SHALL NOT USE THIS FORSAYD CRAFTI DISPORT FOR NO COVETOUSNESS TO THE ENCREASING AND SPARING OF YOUR MONEY ONLY BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR YOUR SOLACE
6550-53343-0023 AND TO CAUSE THE HELTH OF YOUR BODY AND SPECYALLY OF YOUR SOULE
6550-53343-0024 AND THERE WAS A CHEERFUL CONTENTEDNESS IN HIS LOOKS THAT QUITE DREW ME TOWARDS HIM I COULD NOT BUT REMARK THE GALLANT MANNER IN WHICH HE STUMPED FROM ONE PART OF THE BROOK TO ANOTHER WAVING HIS ROD IN THE AIR TO KEEP THE LINE FROM DRAGGING ON THE GROUND OR CATCHING AMONG THE BUSHES AND THE ADROITNESS
6550-53343-0025 THE COUNTRY AROUND WAS OF THAT PASTORAL KIND WHICH WALTON IS FOND OF DESCRIBING IT WAS A PART OF THE GREAT PLAIN OF CHESHIRE CLOSE BY THE BEAUTIFUL VALE OF GESSFORD
6550-53343-0026 HE WAS VERY COMMUNICATIVE HAVING ALL THE EASY GARRULITY
6550-53343-0027 FOR WHO DOES NOT LIKE NOW AND THEN TO PLAY THE SAGE HE HAD BEEN MUCH OF A RAMBLER IN HIS DAY AND HAD PASSED SOME YEARS OF HIS YOUTH IN AMERICA PARTICULARLY IN SAVANNAH
6550-53343-0028 HE HAD AFTERWARDS EXPERIENCED MANY UPS AND DOWNS IN LIFE UNTIL HE GOT INTO THE NAVY WHERE HIS LEG WAS CARRIED AWAY BY A CANNON BALL AT THE BATTLE OF CAMPERDOWN THIS WAS THE ONLY STROKE OF REAL GOOD FORTUNE HE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED FOR IT GOT HIM A PENSION
6550-53343-0029 WHICH TOGETHER WITH SOME SMALL PATERNAL PROPERTY BROUGHT HIM IN A REVENUE OF NEARLY FORTY POUNDS
6550-53343-0030 AND DEVOTED THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE TO THE NOBLE ART OF ANGLING
6550-53343-0031 AND HE SEEMED TO HAVE IMBIBED ALL HIS SIMPLE FRANKNESS AND PREVALENT GOOD HUMOR THOUGH HE HAD BEEN SORELY BUFFETED ABOUT THE WORLD HE WAS SATISFIED THAT THE WORLD IN ITSELF WAS GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL THOUGH HE HAD BEEN AS ROUGHLY USED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AS A POOR SHEEP THAT IS FLEECED BY EVERY HEDGE AND THICKET
6550-53343-0032 YET HE SPOKE OF EVERY NATION WITH CANDOR AND KINDNESS APPEARING TO LOOK ONLY ON THE GOOD SIDE OF THINGS AND ABOVE ALL HE WAS ALMOST THE ONLY MAN I HAD EVER MET WITH WHO HAD BEEN AN UNFORTUNATE ADVENTURER IN AMERICA
6550-53343-0033 AND OF COURSE A YOUTH OF SOME EXPECTATION AND MUCH COURTED BY THE IDLE GENTLEMAN LIKE PERSONAGES OF THE PLACE IN TAKING HIM UNDER HIS CARE THEREFORE THE OLD MAN HAD PROBABLY AN EYE TO A PRIVILEGED CORNER IN THE TAP ROOM AND AN OCCASIONAL CUP OF CHEERFUL ALE FREE OF EXPENSE
6550-53343-0034 IT HAS BEEN REDUCED AMONG THEM TO PERFECT RULE AND SYSTEM INDEED IT IS AN AMUSEMENT PECULIARLY ADAPTED TO THE MILD AND HIGHLY CULTIVATED SCENERY OF ENGLAND WHERE EVERY ROUGHNESS HAS BEEN SOFTENED AWAY FROM THE LANDSCAPE
6550-53343-0035 IT IS DELIGHTFUL TO SAUNTER ALONG THOSE LIMPID STREAMS WHICH WANDER LIKE VEINS OF SILVER THROUGH THE BOSOM OF THIS BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY LEADING ONE THROUGH A DIVERSITY OF SMALL HOME SCENERY SOMETIMES WINDING THROUGH ORNAMENTED GROUNDS
6550-53343-0036 SOMETIMES BRIMMING ALONG THROUGH RICH PASTURAGE WHERE THE FRESH GREEN IS MINGLED WITH SWEET SMELLING FLOWERS SOMETIMES VENTURING IN SIGHT OF VILLAGES AND HAMLETS AND THEN RUNNING CAPRICIOUSLY AWAY INTO SHADY RETIREMENTS THE SWEETNESS AND SERENITY OF NATURE
6550-53343-0037 AND THE QUIET WATCHFULNESS OF THE SPORT GRADUALLY BRING ON PLEASANT FITS OF MUSING WHICH ARE NOW AND THEN AGREEABLY INTERRUPTED BY THE SONG OF A BIRD THE DISTANT WHISTLE OF THE PEASANT OR PERHAPS THE VAGARY OF SOME FISH LEAPING OUT OF THE STILL WATER
6550-53343-0038 AND SKIMMING TRANSIENTLY ABOUT ITS GLASSY SURFACE
6550-53343-0039 I CANNOT FORBEAR TO GIVE ANOTHER QUOTATION FROM ONE OF THOSE ANCIENT CHAMPIONS OF ANGLING WHICH BREATHES THE SAME INNOCENT AND HAPPY SPIRIT LET ME LIVE HARMLESSLY AND NEAR THE BRINK OF TRENT OR AVON HAVE A DWELLING PLACE
6550-53343-0040 WHERE I MAY SEE MY QUILL OR CORK DOWN SINK WITH EAGER BITE OF PIKE OR BLEAK OR DACE AND ON THE WORLD AND MY CREATOR THINK WHILST SOME MEN STRIVE ILL GOTTEN GOODS T EMBRACE
6550-53343-0041 SO I THE FIELDS AND MEADOWS GREEN MAY VIEW AND DAILY BY FRESH RIVERS WALK AT WILL AMONG THE DAISIES AND THE VIOLETS BLUE RED HYACINTH AND YELLOW DAFFODIL
6550-53343-0042 ON THE TOP WAS A SHIP FOR A WEATHERCOCK THE INTERIOR WAS FITTED UP IN A TRULY NAUTICAL STYLE HIS IDEAS OF COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE HAVING BEEN ACQUIRED ON THE BERTH DECK OF A MAN OF WAR
6550-53343-0043 A HAMMOCK WAS SLUNG FROM THE CEILING WHICH IN THE DAYTIME WAS LASHED UP SO AS TO TAKE BUT LITTLE ROOM FROM THE CENTRE OF THE CHAMBER HUNG A MODEL OF A SHIP OF HIS OWN WORKMANSHIP TWO OR THREE CHAIRS A TABLE AND A LARGE SEA CHEST FORMED THE PRINCIPAL MOVABLES
6550-53343-0044 THE MANTELPIECE WAS DECORATED WITH SEA SHELLS OVER WHICH HUNG A QUADRANT FLANKED BY TWO WOOD CUTS OF MOST BITTER LOOKING NAVAL COMMANDERS
6550-53343-0045 HIS IMPLEMENTS FOR ANGLING WERE CAREFULLY DISPOSED ON NAILS AND HOOKS ABOUT THE ROOM ON A SHELF WAS ARRANGED HIS LIBRARY CONTAINING A WORK ON ANGLING MUCH WORN A BIBLE COVERED WITH CANVAS AN ODD VOLUME OR TWO OF VOYAGES
6550-53343-0046 THE ESTABLISHMENT REMINDED ME OF THAT OF THE RENOWNED ROBINSON CRUSOE IT WAS KEPT IN NEAT ORDER EVERYTHING BEING STOWED AWAY WITH THE REGULARITY OF A SHIP OF WAR AND HE INFORMED ME THAT HE SCOURED THE DECK EVERY MORNING AND SWEPT IT BETWEEN MEALS
6550-53343-0047 I FOUND HIM SEATED ON A BENCH BEFORE THE DOOR SMOKING HIS PIPE IN THE SOFT EVENING SUNSHINE HIS CAT WAS PURRING SOBERLY ON THE THRESHOLD AND HIS PARROT DESCRIBING SOME STRANGE EVOLUTIONS IN AN IRON RING THAT SWUNG IN THE CENTRE OF HIS CAGE
6550-53343-0048 HE HAD BEEN ANGLING ALL DAY AND GAVE ME A HISTORY OF HIS SPORT WITH AS MUCH MINUTENESS AS A GENERAL WOULD TALK OVER A CAMPAIGN BEING PARTICULARLY ANIMATED IN RELATING THE MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD TAKEN A LARGE TROUT WHICH HAD COMPLETELY TASKED ALL HIS SKILL AND WARINESS
6550-53343-0049 HIS HAPPINESS HOWEVER SPRUNG FROM WITHIN HIMSELF AND WAS INDEPENDENT OF EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES FOR HE HAD THAT INEXHAUSTIBLE GOOD NATURE WHICH IS THE MOST PRECIOUS GIFT OF HEAVEN SPREADING ITSELF LIKE OIL OVER THE TROUBLED SEA OF THOUGHT
6550-53343-0050 AND WAS A PRIVILEGED VISITOR TO THEIR KITCHENS THE WHOLE TENOR OF HIS LIFE WAS QUIET AND INOFFENSIVE BEING PRINCIPALLY PASSED ABOUT THE NEIGHBORING STREAMS WHEN THE WEATHER AND SEASON WERE FAVORABLE AND AT OTHER TIMES HE EMPLOYED HIMSELF AT HOME
6550-53343-0051 IT WAS THE SPOT WHERE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER HAD BEEN BURIED I HAVE DONE FOR I FEAR THAT MY READER IS GROWING WEARY BUT I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM DRAWING THE PICTURE OF THIS WORTHY BROTHER OF THE ANGLE WHO HAS MADE ME MORE THAN EVER IN LOVE WITH THE THEORY
6550-53343-0052 THOUGH I FEAR I SHALL NEVER BE ADROIT IN THE PRACTICE OF HIS ART
