548-126961-0000 WHOM THE ATHENIANS FORTHWITH LODGED IN THE NEIGHBOURING ISLANDS OF THEIR EMPIRE THE ATHENIANS ALSO MADE AN EXPEDITION AGAINST THE ISLE OF MELOS WITH THIRTY SHIPS OF THEIR OWN
548-126961-0001 AND TWO LESBIAN VESSELS SIXTEEN HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY THREE HUNDRED ARCHERS AND TWENTY MOUNTED ARCHERS FROM ATHENS AND ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY FROM THE ALLIES AND THE ISLANDERS
548-126961-0002 AND AT FIRST REMAINED NEUTRAL AND TOOK NO PART IN THE STRUGGLE BUT AFTERWARDS UPON THE ATHENIANS USING VIOLENCE AND PLUNDERING THEIR TERRITORY ASSUMED AN ATTITUDE OF OPEN HOSTILITY
548-126961-0003 ENCAMPING IN THEIR TERRITORY WITH THE ABOVE ARMAMENT BEFORE DOING ANY HARM TO THEIR LAND SENT ENVOYS TO NEGOTIATE THESE THE MELIANS DID NOT BRING BEFORE THE PEOPLE
548-126961-0004 BUT BADE THEM STATE THE OBJECT OF THEIR MISSION TO THE MAGISTRATES AND THE FEW UPON WHICH THE ATHENIAN ENVOYS SPOKE AS FOLLOWS ATHENIANS SINCE THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOT TO GO ON BEFORE THE PEOPLE
548-126961-0005 IN ORDER THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SPEAK STRAIGHT ON WITHOUT INTERRUPTION AND DECEIVE THE EARS OF THE MULTITUDE BY SEDUCTIVE ARGUMENTS WHICH WOULD PASS WITHOUT REFUTATION FOR WE KNOW THAT THIS IS THE MEANING OF OUR BEING BROUGHT BEFORE THE FEW
548-126961-0006 WHAT IF YOU WHO SIT THERE WERE TO PURSUE A METHOD MORE CAUTIOUS STILL MAKE NO SET SPEECH YOURSELVES BUT TAKE US UP AT WHATEVER YOU DO NOT LIKE AND SETTLE THAT BEFORE GOING ANY FARTHER
548-126961-0007 AND FIRST TELL US IF THIS PROPOSITION OF OURS SUITS YOU THE MELIAN COMMISSIONERS ANSWERED MELIANS TO THE FAIRNESS OF QUIETLY INSTRUCTING EACH OTHER AS YOU PROPOSE
548-126961-0008 MELIANS IT IS NATURAL AND EXCUSABLE FOR MEN IN OUR POSITION TO TURN MORE WAYS THAN ONE BOTH IN THOUGHT AND UTTERANCE HOWEVER THE QUESTION IN THIS CONFERENCE IS AS YOU SAY
548-126961-0009 WHILE THE STRONG DO WHAT THEY CAN AND THE WEAK SUFFER WHAT THEY MUST MELIANS AS WE THINK AT ANY RATE IT IS EXPEDIENT
548-126961-0010 THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING ALLOWED IN DANGER TO INVOKE WHAT IS FAIR AND RIGHT AND EVEN TO PROFIT BY ARGUMENTS NOT STRICTLY VALID IF THEY CAN BE GOT TO PASS CURRENT AND YOU ARE AS MUCH INTERESTED IN THIS AS ANY
548-126961-0011 AS YOUR FALL WOULD BE A SIGNAL FOR THE HEAVIEST VENGEANCE AND AN EXAMPLE FOR THE WORLD TO MEDITATE UPON ATHENIANS THE END OF OUR EMPIRE IF END IT SHOULD DOES NOT FRIGHTEN US
548-126961-0012 WE WILL NOW PROCEED TO SHOW YOU THAT WE ARE COME HERE IN THE INTEREST OF OUR EMPIRE AND THAT WE SHALL SAY WHAT WE ARE NOW GOING TO SAY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF YOUR COUNTRY AS WE WOULD FAIN EXERCISE THAT EMPIRE
548-126961-0013 OVER YOU WITHOUT TROUBLE AND SEE YOU PRESERVED FOR THE GOOD OF US BOTH MELIANS AND HOW PRAY COULD IT TURN OUT AS GOOD FOR US TO SERVE AS FOR YOU TO RULE ATHENIANS
548-126961-0014 BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF SUBMITTING BEFORE SUFFERING THE WORST AND WE SHOULD GAIN BY NOT DESTROYING YOU MELIANS SO THAT YOU WOULD NOT CONSENT TO OUR BEING NEUTRAL
548-126961-0015 THAT ARE MOST OF THEM YOUR OWN COLONISTS AND SOME CONQUERED REBELS ATHENIANS AS FAR AS RIGHT GOES THEY THINK ONE HAS AS MUCH OF IT AS THE OTHER AND THAT IF ANY MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE
548-126961-0016 IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE STRONG AND THAT IF WE DO NOT MOLEST THEM IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID SO THAT BESIDES EXTENDING OUR EMPIRE WE SHOULD GAIN IN SECURITY BY YOUR SUBJECTION
548-126961-0017 THE FACT THAT YOU ARE ISLANDERS AND WEAKER THAN OTHERS RENDERING IT ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT THAT YOU SHOULD NOT SUCCEED IN BAFFLING THE MASTERS OF THE SEA MELIANS BUT DO YOU CONSIDER
548-126961-0018 THAT THERE IS NO SECURITY IN THE POLICY WHICH WE INDICATE FOR HERE AGAIN IF YOU DEBAR US FROM TALKING ABOUT JUSTICE AND INVITE US TO OBEY YOUR INTEREST WE ALSO MUST EXPLAIN OURS
548-126961-0019 AND SUBJECTS SMARTING UNDER THE YOKE WHO WOULD BE THE MOST LIKELY TO TAKE A RASH STEP AND LEAD THEMSELVES AND US INTO OBVIOUS DANGER MELIANS WELL THEN
548-126961-0020 IF YOU RISK SO MUCH TO RETAIN YOUR EMPIRE AND YOUR SUBJECTS TO GET RID OF IT
548-126961-0021 WITH HONOUR AS THE PRIZE AND SHAME AS THE PENALTY BUT A QUESTION OF SELF PRESERVATION AND OF NOT RESISTING THOSE WHO ARE FAR STRONGER THAN YOU ARE MELIANS
548-126961-0022 BUT WE KNOW THAT THE FORTUNE OF WAR IS SOMETIMES MORE IMPARTIAL THAN THE DISPROPORTION OF NUMBERS MIGHT LEAD ONE TO SUPPOSE TO SUBMIT IS TO GIVE OURSELVES OVER TO DESPAIR
548-126961-0023 WHILE ACTION STILL PRESERVES FOR US A HOPE THAT WE MAY STAND ERECT ATHENIANS HOPE DANGER'S COMFORTER MAY BE INDULGED IN BY THOSE WHO HAVE ABUNDANT RESOURCES
548-126961-0024 ONLY WHEN THEY ARE RUINED BUT SO LONG AS THE DISCOVERY WOULD ENABLE THEM TO GUARD AGAINST IT IT IS NEVER FOUND WANTING LET NOT THIS BE THE CASE WITH YOU WHO ARE WEAK AND HANG ON A SINGLE TURN OF THE SCALE
548-126961-0025 NOR BE LIKE THE VULGAR WHO ABANDONING SUCH SECURITY AS HUMAN MEANS MAY STILL AFFORD WHEN VISIBLE HOPES FAIL THEM IN EXTREMITY TURN TO INVISIBLE TO PROPHECIES AND ORACLES
548-126961-0026 AND OTHER SUCH INVENTIONS THAT DELUDE MEN WITH HOPES TO THEIR DESTRUCTION MELIANS
548-126961-0027 UNLESS THE TERMS BE EQUAL BUT WE TRUST THAT THE GODS MAY GRANT US FORTUNE AS GOOD AS YOURS SINCE WE ARE JUST MEN FIGHTING AGAINST UNJUST
548-126961-0028 IF ONLY FOR VERY SHAME TO COME TO THE AID OF THEIR KINDRED OUR CONFIDENCE THEREFORE AFTER ALL IS NOT SO UTTERLY IRRATIONAL ATHENIANS
548-126961-0029 OF THE GODS WE BELIEVE AND OF MEN WE KNOW THAT BY A NECESSARY LAW OF THEIR NATURE THEY RULE WHEREVER THEY CAN AND IT IS NOT AS IF WE WERE THE FIRST TO MAKE THIS LAW OR TO ACT UPON IT WHEN MADE
548-126961-0030 KNOWING THAT YOU AND EVERYBODY ELSE HAVING THE SAME POWER AS WE HAVE WOULD DO THE SAME AS WE DO THUS AS FAR AS THE GODS ARE CONCERNED WE HAVE NO FEAR AND NO REASON TO FEAR THAT WE SHALL BE AT A DISADVANTAGE
548-126961-0031 WHICH LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE THAT SHAME WILL MAKE THEM HELP YOU HERE WE BLESS YOUR SIMPLICITY BUT DO NOT ENVY YOUR FOLLY THE LACEDAEMONIANS WHEN THEIR OWN INTERESTS OR THEIR COUNTRY'S LAWS ARE IN QUESTION
548-126961-0032 BUT IT IS FOR THIS VERY REASON THAT WE NOW TRUST TO THEIR RESPECT FOR EXPEDIENCY TO PREVENT THEM FROM BETRAYING THE MELIANS THEIR COLONISTS AND THEREBY LOSING THE CONFIDENCE OF THEIR FRIENDS IN HELLAS
548-126961-0033 AND HELPING THEIR ENEMIES ATHENIANS THEN YOU DO NOT ADOPT THE VIEW THAT EXPEDIENCY GOES WITH SECURITY WHILE JUSTICE AND HONOUR CANNOT BE FOLLOWED WITHOUT DANGER
548-126961-0034 MELIANS BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO FACE EVEN DANGER FOR OUR SAKE AND WITH MORE CONFIDENCE THAN FOR OTHERS AS OUR NEARNESS TO PELOPONNESE MAKES IT EASIER FOR THEM TO ACT
548-126961-0035 MELIANS BUT THEY WOULD HAVE OTHERS TO SEND THE CRETAN SEA IS A WIDE ONE AND IT IS MORE DIFFICULT FOR THOSE WHO COMMAND IT TO INTERCEPT OTHERS THAN FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO ELUDE THEM TO DO SO SAFELY
548-126961-0036 SOME DIVERSION OF THE KIND YOU SPEAK OF YOU MAY ONE DAY EXPERIENCE ONLY TO LEARN AS OTHERS HAVE DONE THAT THE ATHENIANS NEVER ONCE YET WITHDREW FROM A SIEGE FOR FEAR OF ANY
548-126961-0037 SINCE IN TOO MANY CASES THE VERY MEN THAT HAVE THEIR EYES PERFECTLY OPEN TO WHAT THEY ARE RUSHING INTO LET THE THING CALLED DISGRACE BY THE MERE INFLUENCE OF A SEDUCTIVE NAME
548-126961-0038 LEAD THEM ON TO A POINT AT WHICH THEY BECOME SO ENSLAVED BY THE PHRASE AS IN FACT TO FALL WILFULLY INTO HOPELESS DISASTER AND INCUR DISGRACE MORE DISGRACEFUL AS THE COMPANION OF ERROR
548-126961-0039 THAN WHEN IT COMES AS THE RESULT OF MISFORTUNE THIS IF YOU ARE WELL ADVISED YOU WILL GUARD AGAINST AND YOU WILL NOT THINK IT DISHONOURABLE TO SUBMIT TO THE GREATEST CITY IN HELLAS
548-126961-0040 WHEN IT MAKES YOU THE MODERATE OFFER OF BECOMING ITS TRIBUTARY ALLY WITHOUT CEASING TO ENJOY THE COUNTRY THAT BELONGS TO YOU NOR WHEN YOU HAVE THE CHOICE GIVEN YOU BETWEEN WAR AND SECURITY
548-126961-0041 WILL YOU BE SO BLINDED AS TO CHOOSE THE WORSE AND IT IS CERTAIN THAT THOSE WHO DO NOT YIELD TO THEIR EQUALS WHO KEEP TERMS WITH THEIR SUPERIORS AND ARE MODERATE TOWARDS THEIR INFERIORS ON THE WHOLE SUCCEED BEST
548-126961-0042 AS ALREADY COMING TO PASS AND AS YOU HAVE STAKED MOST ON AND TRUSTED MOST IN
548-126961-0043 SO WILL YOU BE MOST COMPLETELY DECEIVED THE ATHENIAN ENVOYS NOW RETURNED TO THE ARMY AND THE MELIANS SHOWING NO SIGNS OF YIELDING
548-126961-0044 AND DREW A LINE OF CIRCUMVALLATION ROUND THE MELIANS DIVIDING THE WORK AMONG THE DIFFERENT STATES SUBSEQUENTLY THE ATHENIANS RETURNED WITH MOST OF THEIR ARMY
548-126961-0045 MIGHT PLUNDER THE ATHENIANS THE CORINTHIANS ALSO COMMENCED HOSTILITIES WITH THE ATHENIANS FOR PRIVATE QUARRELS OF THEIR OWN BUT THE REST OF THE PELOPONNESIANS STAYED QUIET MEANWHILE
548-126961-0046 THE MELIANS ATTACKED BY NIGHT AND TOOK THE PART OF THE ATHENIAN LINES OVER AGAINST THE MARKET AND KILLED SOME OF THE MEN AND BROUGHT IN CORN AND ALL ELSE THAT THEY COULD FIND USEFUL TO THEM AND SO RETURNED AND KEPT QUIET
548-126961-0047 WHILE THE ATHENIANS TOOK MEASURES TO KEEP BETTER GUARD IN FUTURE SUMMER WAS NOW OVER
