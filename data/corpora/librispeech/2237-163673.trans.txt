2237-163673-0000 LORNA GROWING FORMIDABLE HAVING RECONNOITRED THUS THE POSITION OF THE ENEMY MASTER HUCKABACK ON THE HOMEWARD ROAD CROSS EXAMINED ME IN A MANNER NOT AT ALL DESIRABLE
2237-163673-0001 FOR HE HAD NOTED MY CONFUSION AND EAGER GAZE AT SOMETHING UNSEEN BY HIM IN THE VALLEY AND THEREUPON HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IN THIS HOWEVER HE PARTLY FAILED FOR ALTHOUGH I WAS NO HAND AT FENCE AND WOULD NOT TELL HIM A FALSEHOOD
2237-163673-0002 I MANAGED SO TO HOLD MY PEACE THAT HE PUT HIMSELF UPON THE WRONG TRACK AND CONTINUED THEREON WITH MANY VAUNTS OF HIS SHREWDNESS AND EXPERIENCE AND SOME CHUCKLES AT MY SIMPLICITY THUS MUCH HOWEVER HE LEARNED ARIGHT THAT I HAD BEEN IN THE DOONE VALLEY SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE
2237-163673-0003 AND MIGHT BE BROUGHT UPON STRONG INDUCEMENT TO VENTURE THERE AGAIN BUT AS TO THE MODE OF MY GETTING IN THE THINGS I SAW AND MY THOUGHTS UPON THEM HE NOT ONLY FAILED TO LEARN THE TRUTH BUT CERTIFIED HIMSELF INTO AN OBSTINACY OF ERROR FROM WHICH NO AFTER KNOWLEDGE WAS ABLE TO DELIVER HIM
2237-163673-0004 AND THIS HE DID NOT ONLY BECAUSE I HAPPENED TO SAY VERY LITTLE BUT FORASMUCH AS HE DISBELIEVED HALF OF THE TRUTH I TOLD HIM THROUGH HIS OWN TOO GREAT SAGACITY UPON ONE POINT HOWEVER HE SUCCEEDED MORE EASILY THAN HE EXPECTED
2237-163673-0005 VIZ IN MAKING ME PROMISE TO VISIT THE PLACE AGAIN AS SOON AS OCCASION OFFERED
2237-163673-0006 BUT I COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT ONE THING THAT ACCORDING TO HIS POINT OF VIEW MY OWN COUNSEL MEANT MY OWN AND MASTER REUBEN HUCKABACK'S
2237-163673-0007 AND LEAVING BEHIND HIM SHADOWY PROMISE OF THE MOUNTAINS HE WOULD DO FOR ME MY SPIRIT BEGAN TO BURN AND PANT FOR SOMETHING TO GO ON WITH AND NOTHING SHOWED A BRAVER HOPE OF MOVEMENT AND ADVENTURE THAN A LONELY VISIT TO GLEN DOONE BY WAY OF THE PERILOUS PASSAGE DISCOVERED IN MY BOYHOOD
2237-163673-0008 THEREFORE I WAITED FOR NOTHING MORE THAN THE SLOW ARRIVAL OF NEW SMALL CLOTHES MADE BY A GOOD TAILOR AT PORLOCK FOR I WAS WISHFUL TO LOOK MY BEST AND WHEN THEY WERE COME AND APPROVED I STARTED REGARDLESS OF THE EXPENSE AND FORGETTING LIKE A FOOL
2237-163673-0009 HOW BADLY THEY WOULD TAKE THE WATER WHAT WITH URGING OF THE TAILOR AND MY OWN MISGIVINGS THE TIME WAS NOW COME ROUND AGAIN TO THE HIGH DAY OF SAINT VALENTINE WHEN ALL OUR MAIDS WERE FULL OF LOVERS AND ALL THE LADS LOOKED FOOLISH
2237-163673-0010 AND NONE OF THEM MORE SHEEPISH OR INNOCENT THAN I MYSELF ALBEIT TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD AND NOT AFRAID OF MEN MUCH BUT TERRIFIED OF WOMEN AT LEAST IF THEY WERE COMELY AND WHAT OF ALL THINGS SCARED ME MOST WAS THE THOUGHT OF MY OWN SIZE AND KNOWLEDGE OF MY STRENGTH
2237-163673-0011 WHICH CAME LIKE KNOTS UPON ME DAILY IN HONEST TRUTH I TELL THIS THING WHICH OFTEN SINCE HATH PUZZLED ME WHEN I CAME TO MIX WITH MEN MORE I WAS TO THAT DEGREE ASHAMED OF MY THICKNESS AND MY STATURE IN THE PRESENCE OF A WOMAN THAT I WOULD NOT PUT A TRUNK OF WOOD ON THE FIRE IN THE KITCHEN
2237-163673-0012 BUT LET ANNIE SCOLD ME WELL WITH A SMILE TO FOLLOW
2237-163673-0013 MANY A TIME I LONGED TO BE NO BIGGER THAN JOHN FRY WAS WHOM NOW WHEN INSOLENT I TOOK WITH MY LEFT HAND BY THE WAIST STUFF AND SET HIM ON MY HAT AND GAVE HIM LITTLE CHANCE TO TREAD IT UNTIL HE SPOKE OF HIS FAMILY AND REQUESTED TO COME DOWN AGAIN
2237-163673-0014 NOW TAKING FOR GOOD OMEN THIS THAT I WAS A SEVEN YEAR VALENTINE THOUGH MUCH TOO BIG FOR A CUPIDON I CHOSE A SEVEN FOOT STAFF OF ASH AND FIXED A LOACH FORK IN IT TO LOOK AS I HAD LOOKED BEFORE
2237-163673-0015 AND LEAVING WORD UPON MATTERS OF BUSINESS OUT OF THE BACK DOOR I WENT AND SO THROUGH THE LITTLE ORCHARD AND DOWN THE BRAWLING LYNN BROOK NOT BEING NOW SO MUCH AFRAID I STRUCK ACROSS THE THICKET LAND BETWEEN THE MEETING WATERS AND CAME UPON THE BAGWORTHY STREAM NEAR THE GREAT BLACK WHIRLPOOL
2237-163673-0016 NOTHING AMAZED ME SO MUCH AS TO FIND HOW SHALLOW THE STREAM NOW LOOKED TO ME ALTHOUGH THE POOL WAS STILL AS BLACK AND GREEDY AS IT USED TO BE AND STILL THE GREAT ROCKY SLIDE WAS DARK AND DIFFICULT TO CLIMB THOUGH THE WATER WHICH ONCE HAD TAKEN MY KNEES
2237-163673-0017 WAS SATISFIED NOW WITH MY ANKLES AFTER SOME LABOUR I REACHED THE TOP AND HALTED TO LOOK ABOUT ME WELL BEFORE TRUSTING TO BROAD DAYLIGHT THE WINTER AS I SAID BEFORE HAD BEEN A VERY MILD ONE
2237-163673-0018 AND NOW THE SPRING WAS TOWARD SO THAT BANK AND BUSH WERE TOUCHED WITH IT THE VALLEY INTO WHICH I GAZED WAS FAIR WITH EARLY PROMISE HAVING SHELTER FROM THE WIND AND TAKING ALL THE SUNSHINE THE WILLOW BUSHES OVER THE STREAM HUNG AS IF THEY WERE ANGLING WITH TASSELED FLOATS OF GOLD AND SILVER
2237-163673-0019 BURSTING LIKE A BEAN POD BETWEEN THEM CAME THE WATER LAUGHING LIKE A MAID AT HER OWN DANCING AND SPREAD WITH THAT YOUNG BLUE WHICH NEVER LIVES BEYOND THE APRIL AND ON EITHER BANK THE MEADOW RUFFLED AS THE BREEZE CAME BY
2237-163673-0020 OPENING THROUGH NEW TUFT OF GREEN DAISY BUD OR CELANDINE OR A SHY GLIMPSE NOW AND THEN OF THE LOVE LORN PRIMROSE THOUGH I AM SO BLANK OF WIT OR PERHAPS FOR THAT SAME REASON THESE LITTLE THINGS COME AND DWELL WITH ME AND I AM HAPPY ABOUT THEM
2237-163673-0021 AND LONG FOR NOTHING BETTER I FEEL WITH EVERY BLADE OF GRASS AS IF IT HAD A HISTORY AND MAKE A CHILD OF EVERY BUD AS THOUGH IT KNEW AND LOVED ME AND BEING SO THEY SEEM TO TELL ME OF MY OWN DELUSIONS HOW I AM NO MORE THAN THEY EXCEPT IN SELF IMPORTANCE
2237-163673-0022 WHILE I WAS FORGETTING MUCH OF MANY THINGS THAT HARM ONE AND LETTING OF MY THOUGHTS GO WILD TO SOUNDS AND SIGHTS OF NATURE A SWEETER NOTE THAN THRUSH OR OUZEL EVER WOOED A MATE IN FLOATED ON THE VALLEY BREEZE AT THE QUIET TURN OF SUNDOWN
2237-163673-0023 THE WORDS WERE OF AN ANCIENT SONG FIT TO LAUGH OR CRY AT LOVE AN IF THERE BE ONE COME MY LOVE TO BE MY LOVE IS FOR THE ONE LOVING UNTO ME
2237-163673-0024 OF A GILDED BLISS ONLY THOU MUST KNOW LOVE WHAT MY VALUE IS IF IN ALL THE EARTH LOVE THOU HAST NONE BUT ME THIS SHALL BE MY WORTH LOVE TO BE CHEAP TO THEE BUT IF SO THOU EVER STRIVEST TO BE FREE
2237-163673-0025 TWILL BE MY ENDEAVOUR TO BE DEAR TO THEE SO SHALL I HAVE PLEA LOVE IS THY HEART ANDBREATH CLINGING STILL TO THEE LOVE IN THE DOOM OF DEATH ALL THIS I TOOK IN WITH GREAT EAGERNESS NOT FOR THE SAKE OF THE MEANING WHICH IS NO DOUBT AN ALLEGORY
2237-163673-0026 BUT FOR THE POWER AND RICHNESS AND SOFTNESS OF THE SINGING WHICH SEEMED TO ME BETTER THAN WE EVER HAD EVEN IN OARE CHURCH BUT ALL THE TIME I KEPT MYSELF IN A BLACK NICHE OF THE ROCK WHERE THE FALL OF THE WATER BEGAN LEST THE SWEET SINGER ESPYING ME
2237-163673-0027 SHOULD BE ALARMED AND FLEE AWAY BUT PRESENTLY I VENTURED TO LOOK FORTH WHERE A BUSH WAS AND THEN I BEHELD THE LOVELIEST SIGHT ONE GLIMPSE OF WHICH WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME KNEEL IN THE COLDEST WATER BY THE SIDE OF THE STREAM SHE WAS COMING TO ME
2237-163673-0028 EVEN AMONG THE PRIMROSES AS IF SHE LOVED THEM ALL AND EVERY FLOWER LOOKED THE BRIGHTER AS HER EYES WERE ON THEM I COULD NOT SEE WHAT HER FACE WAS MY HEART SO AWOKE AND TREMBLED ONLY THAT HER HAIR WAS FLOWING FROM A WREATH OF WHITE VIOLETS
2237-163673-0029 AND THE GRACE OF HER COMING WAS LIKE THE APPEARANCE OF THE FIRST WIND FLOWER THE PALE GLEAM OVER THE WESTERN CLIFFS THREW A SHADOW OF LIGHT BEHIND HER AS IF THE SUN WERE LINGERING NEVER DO I SEE THAT LIGHT FROM THE CLOSING OF THE WEST EVEN IN THESE MY AGED DAYS
2237-163673-0030 WITHOUT THINKING OF HER AH ME IF IT COMES TO THAT WHAT DO I SEE OF EARTH OR HEAVEN WITHOUT THINKING OF HER THE TREMULOUS THRILL OF HER SONG WAS HANGING ON HER OPEN LIPS AND SHE GLANCED AROUND AS IF THE BIRDS WERE ACCUSTOMED TO MAKE ANSWER
2237-163673-0031 TO ME IT WAS A THING OF TERROR TO BEHOLD SUCH BEAUTY AND FEEL MYSELF THE WHILE TO BE SO VERY LOW AND COMMON BUT SCARCELY KNOWING WHAT I DID AS IF A ROPE WERE DRAWING ME I CAME FROM THE DARK MOUTH OF THE CHASM AND STOOD AFRAID TO LOOK AT HER
2237-163673-0032 SHE WAS TURNING TO FLY NOT KNOWING ME AND FRIGHTENED PERHAPS AT MY STATURE WHEN I FELL ON THE GRASS AS I FELL BEFORE HER SEVEN YEARS AGONE THAT DAY AND I JUST SAID LORNA DOONE SHE KNEW ME AT ONCE FROM MY MANNER AND WAYS
2237-163673-0033 AND A SMILE BROKE THROUGH HER TREMBLING AS SUNSHINE COMES THROUGH ASPEN LEAVES AND BEING SO CLEVER SHE SAW OF COURSE THAT SHE NEEDED NOT TO FEAR ME OH INDEED SHE CRIED WITH A FEINT OF ANGER
2237-163673-0034 BECAUSE SHE HAD SHOWN HER COWARDICE AND YET IN HER HEART SHE WAS LAUGHING OH IF YOU PLEASE WHO ARE YOU SIR AND HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME I AM JOHN RIDD I ANSWERED THE BOY WHO GAVE YOU THOSE BEAUTIFUL FISH WHEN YOU WERE ONLY A LITTLE THING SEVEN YEARS AGO TO DAY
2237-163673-0035 YES THE POOR BOY WHO WAS FRIGHTENED SO AND OBLIGED TO HIDE HERE IN THE WATER AND DO YOU REMEMBER HOW KIND YOU WERE AND SAVED MY LIFE BY YOUR QUICKNESS AND WENT AWAY RIDING UPON A GREAT MAN'S SHOULDER AS IF YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME AND YET LOOKED BACK THROUGH THE WILLOW TREES
2237-163673-0036 OH YES I REMEMBER EVERYTHING BECAUSE IT WAS SO RARE TO SEE ANY EXCEPT I MEAN BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO REMEMBER
2237-163673-0037 FOR SHE HAD KEPT HER EYES UPON ME LARGE EYES OF A SOFTNESS A BRIGHTNESS AND A DIGNITY WHICH MADE ME FEEL AS IF I MUST FOR EVER LOVE AND YET FOR EVER KNOW MYSELF UNWORTHY UNLESS THEMSELVES SHOULD FILL WITH LOVE WHICH IS THE SPRING OF ALL THINGS
2237-163673-0038 AND SO I COULD NOT ANSWER HER BUT WAS OVERCOME WITH THINKING AND FEELING AND CONFUSION NEITHER COULD I LOOK AGAIN ONLY WAITED FOR THE MELODY WHICH MADE EVERY WORD LIKE A POEM TO ME THE MELODY OF HER VOICE
2237-163673-0039 BUT SHE HAD NOT THE LEAST IDEA OF WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH ME ANY MORE THAN I MYSELF HAD I THINK MASTER RIDD YOU CANNOT KNOW SHE SAID WITH HER EYES TAKEN FROM ME WHAT THE DANGERS OF THIS PLACE ARE AND THE NATURE OF THE PEOPLE
2237-163673-0040 YES I KNOW ENOUGH OF THAT AND I AM FRIGHTENED GREATLY ALL THE TIME WHEN I DO NOT LOOK AT YOU SHE WAS TOO YOUNG TO ANSWER ME IN THE STYLE SOME MAIDENS WOULD HAVE USED THE MANNER I MEAN WHICH NOW WE CALL FROM A FOREIGN WORD COQUETTISH AND MORE THAN THAT
2237-163673-0041 LEST STRONG HANDS MIGHT BE LAID ON ME AND A MISERABLE END OF IT AND TO TELL THE TRUTH I GREW AFRAID PERHAPS FROM A KIND OF SYMPATHY AND BECAUSE I KNEW THAT EVIL COMES MORE READILY THAN GOOD TO US THEREFORE WITHOUT MORE ADO OR TAKING ANY ADVANTAGE
2237-163673-0042 ALTHOUGH I WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD AT HEART IF NEEDS HAD BEEN TO KISS HER WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT OF RUDENESS
2237-163673-0043 AND HAVE NO MORE TO SAY TO HER UNTIL NEXT TIME OF COMING SO WOULD SHE LOOK THE MORE FOR ME AND THINK THE MORE ABOUT ME AND NOT GROW WEARY OF MY WORDS AND THE WANT OF CHANGE THERE IS IN ME FOR OF COURSE I KNEW WHAT A CHURL I WAS COMPARED TO HER BIRTH AND APPEARANCE
2237-163673-0044 BUT MEANWHILE I MIGHT IMPROVE MYSELF AND LEARN A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT THE WIND HATH A DRAW AFTER FLYING STRAW IS A SAYING WE HAVE IN DEVONSHIRE MADE PERADVENTURE BY SOMEBODY WHO HAD SEEN THE WAYS OF WOMEN MISTRESS LORNA I WILL DEPART'
2237-163673-0045 MARK YOU I THOUGHT THAT A POWERFUL WORD
2237-163673-0046 IF ANY ROGUE SHOT ME IT WOULD GRIEVE YOU I MAKE BOLD TO SAY IT AND IT WOULD BE THE DEATH OF MOTHER FEW MOTHERS HAVE SUCH A SON AS ME TRY TO THINK OF ME NOW AND THEN AND I WILL BRING YOU SOME NEW LAID EGGS FOR OUR YOUNG BLUE HEN IS BEGINNING
2237-163673-0047 I THANK YOU HEARTILY SAID LORNA BUT YOU NEED NOT COME TO SEE ME YOU CAN PUT THEM IN MY LITTLE BOWER WHERE I AM ALMOST ALWAYS I MEAN WHITHER DAILY I REPAIR TO READ AND TO BE AWAY FROM THEM ONLY SHOW ME WHERE IT IS
2237-163673-0048 THRICE A DAY I WILL COME AND STOP NAY MASTER RIDD I WOULD NEVER SHOW THEE NEVER BECAUSE OF PERIL ONLY THAT SO HAPPENS IT THOU HAST FOUND THE WAY ALREADY
2237-163673-0049 AND SHE SMILED WITH A LIGHT THAT MADE ME CARE TO CRY OUT FOR NO OTHER WAY EXCEPT TO HER DEAR HEART BUT ONLY TO MYSELF I CRIED FOR ANYTHING AT ALL HAVING ENOUGH OF MAN IN ME TO BE BASHFUL WITH YOUNG MAIDENS SO I TOUCHED HER WHITE HAND SOFTLY WHEN SHE GAVE IT TO ME
2237-163673-0050 AND FANCYING THAT SHE HAD SIGHED WAS TOUCHED AT HEART ABOUT IT AND RESOLVED TO YIELD HER ALL MY GOODS ALTHOUGH MY MOTHER WAS LIVING AND THEN GREW ANGRY WITH MYSELF FOR A MILE OR MORE OF WALKING TO THINK SHE WOULD CONDESCEND SO
