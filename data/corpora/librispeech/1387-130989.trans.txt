1387-130989-0000 OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION TO PRESERVE THE UNION FROM THE NEW YORK PACKET TUESDAY DECEMBER FOURTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN HAMILTON TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK THE TENDENCY OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGISLATION FOR STATES
1387-130989-0001 OR COMMUNITIES IN THEIR POLITICAL CAPACITIES AS IT HAS BEEN EXEMPLIFIED BY THE EXPERIMENT WE HAVE MADE OF IT IS EQUALLY ATTESTED BY THE EVENTS WHICH HAVE BEFALLEN ALL OTHER GOVERNMENTS OF THE CONFEDERATE KIND OF WHICH WE HAVE ANY ACCOUNT IN EXACT PROPORTION TO ITS PREVALENCE IN THOSE SYSTEMS
1387-130989-0002 THE CONFIRMATIONS OF THIS FACT WILL BE WORTHY OF A DISTINCT AND PARTICULAR EXAMINATION I SHALL CONTENT MYSELF WITH BARELY OBSERVING HERE
1387-130989-0003 AND HAVE MOST LIBERALLY RECEIVED THE APPLAUDING SUFFRAGES OF POLITICAL WRITERS THIS EXCEPTIONABLE PRINCIPLE MAY AS TRULY AS EMPHATICALLY BE STYLED THE PARENT OF ANARCHY
1387-130989-0004 AND THAT WHENEVER THEY HAPPEN THE ONLY CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDY IS FORCE AND THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF THE USE OF IT CIVIL WAR IT REMAINS TO INQUIRE HOW FAR SO ODIOUS AN ENGINE OF GOVERNMENT IN ITS APPLICATION TO US
1387-130989-0005 IN WHICH THE STRONGEST COMBINATION WOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO PREVAIL WHETHER IT CONSISTED OF THOSE WHO SUPPORTED OR OF THOSE WHO RESISTED THE GENERAL AUTHORITY IT WOULD RARELY HAPPEN THAT THE DELINQUENCY TO BE REDRESSED WOULD BE CONFINED TO A SINGLE MEMBER
1387-130989-0006 AND IF THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE WHO HAD NEGLECTED THEIR DUTY SIMILARITY OF SITUATION WOULD INDUCE THEM TO UNITE FOR COMMON DEFENSE INDEPENDENT OF THIS MOTIVE OF SYMPATHY IF A LARGE AND INFLUENTIAL STATE SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE THE AGGRESSING MEMBER
1387-130989-0007 TO ALARM THE APPREHENSIONS INFLAME THE PASSIONS AND CONCILIATE THE GOOD WILL EVEN OF THOSE STATES WHICH WERE NOT CHARGEABLE WITH ANY VIOLATION OR OMISSION OF DUTY
1387-130989-0008 WITH A VIEW TO GETTING RID OF ALL EXTERNAL CONTROL UPON THEIR DESIGNS OF PERSONAL AGGRANDIZEMENT THE BETTER TO EFFECT WHICH IT IS PRESUMABLE THEY WOULD TAMPER BEFOREHAND WITH LEADING INDIVIDUALS IN THE ADJACENT STATES IF ASSOCIATES COULD NOT BE FOUND AT HOME
1387-130989-0009 FROM THE FIRM UNION OF WHICH THEY HAD SO MUCH TO FEAR WHEN THE SWORD IS ONCE DRAWN THE PASSIONS OF MEN OBSERVE NO BOUNDS OF MODERATION THE SUGGESTIONS OF WOUNDED PRIDE THE INSTIGATIONS OF IRRITATED RESENTMENT
1387-130989-0010 WOULD BE APT TO CARRY THE STATES AGAINST WHICH THE ARMS OF THE UNION WERE EXERTED TO ANY EXTREMES NECESSARY TO AVENGE THE AFFRONT OR TO AVOID THE DISGRACE OF SUBMISSION THE FIRST WAR OF THIS KIND WOULD PROBABLY TERMINATE IN A DISSOLUTION
1387-130989-0011 OF THE UNION THIS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE VIOLENT DEATH OF THE CONFEDERACY ITS MORE NATURAL DEATH IS WHAT WE NOW SEEM TO BE ON THE POINT OF EXPERIENCING IF THE FEDERAL SYSTEM BE NOT SPEEDILY RENOVATED IN A MORE SUBSTANTIAL FORM
1387-130989-0012 IT IS NOT PROBABLE CONSIDERING THE GENIUS OF THIS COUNTRY THAT THE COMPLYING STATES WOULD OFTEN BE INCLINED TO SUPPORT THE AUTHORITY OF THE UNION BY ENGAGING IN A WAR AGAINST THE NON COMPLYING STATES
1387-130989-0013 THEY WOULD ALWAYS BE MORE READY TO PURSUE THE MILDER COURSE OF PUTTING THEMSELVES UPON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH THE DELINQUENT MEMBERS BY AN IMITATION OF THEIR EXAMPLE AND THE GUILT OF ALL WOULD THUS BECOME THE SECURITY OF ALL
1387-130989-0014 IN THE ARTICLE OF PECUNIARY CONTRIBUTION WHICH WOULD BE THE MOST USUAL SOURCE OF DELINQUENCY IT WOULD OFTEN BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DECIDE WHETHER IT HAD PROCEEDED FROM DISINCLINATION OR INABILITY THE PRETENSE OF THE LATTER WOULD ALWAYS BE AT HAND
1387-130989-0015 AND THE CASE MUST BE VERY FLAGRANT IN WHICH ITS FALLACY COULD BE DETECTED WITH SUFFICIENT CERTAINTY TO JUSTIFY THE HARSH EXPEDIENT OF COMPULSION
1387-130989-0016 IN THE MAJORITY THAT HAPPENED TO PREVAIL IN THE NATIONAL COUNCIL
1387-130989-0017 IT SEEMS TO REQUIRE NO PAINS TO PROVE THAT THE STATES OUGHT NOT TO PREFER A NATIONAL CONSTITUTION WHICH COULD ONLY BE KEPT IN MOTION BY THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF A LARGE ARMY CONTINUALLY ON FOOT TO EXECUTE THE ORDINARY REQUISITIONS OR DECREES OF THE GOVERNMENT AND YET
1387-130989-0018 THIS IS THE PLAIN ALTERNATIVE INVOLVED BY THOSE WHO WISH TO DENY IT THE POWER OF EXTENDING ITS OPERATIONS TO INDIVIDUALS SUCH A SCHEME IF PRACTICABLE AT ALL WOULD INSTANTLY DEGENERATE INTO A MILITARY DESPOTISM BUT IT WILL BE FOUND IN EVERY LIGHT
1387-130989-0019 WHOEVER CONSIDERS THE POPULOUSNESS AND STRENGTH OF SEVERAL OF THESE STATES SINGLY AT THE PRESENT JUNCTURE AND LOOKS FORWARD TO WHAT THEY WILL BECOME EVEN AT THE DISTANCE OF HALF A CENTURY WILL AT ONCE DISMISS AS IDLE AND VISIONARY ANY SCHEME WHICH AIMS AT REGULATING THEIR MOVEMENTS
1387-130989-0020 BY LAWS TO OPERATE UPON THEM IN THEIR COLLECTIVE CAPACITIES AND TO BE EXECUTED BY A COERCION APPLICABLE TO THEM IN THE SAME CAPACITIES A PROJECT OF THIS KIND IS LITTLE LESS ROMANTIC THAN THE MONSTER TAMING SPIRIT WHICH IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE FABULOUS HEROES AND DEMI GODS OF ANTIQUITY
1387-130989-0021 BUT AGAINST THE WEAKER MEMBERS AND IN MOST INSTANCES ATTEMPTS TO COERCE THE REFRACTORY AND DISOBEDIENT HAVE BEEN THE SIGNALS OF BLOODY WARS IN WHICH ONE HALF OF THE CONFEDERACY HAS DISPLAYED ITS BANNERS AGAINST THE OTHER HALF
1387-130989-0022 THE RESULT OF THESE OBSERVATIONS TO AN INTELLIGENT MIND MUST BE CLEARLY THIS THAT IF IT BE POSSIBLE AT ANY RATE TO CONSTRUCT A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAPABLE OF REGULATING THE COMMON CONCERNS AND PRESERVING THE GENERAL TRANQUILLITY IT MUST BE FOUNDED
1387-130989-0023 AS TO THE OBJECTS COMMITTED TO ITS CARE UPON THE REVERSE OF THE PRINCIPLE CONTENDED FOR BY THE OPPONENTS OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION IT MUST CARRY ITS AGENCY TO THE PERSONS OF THE CITIZENS
1387-130989-0024 IT MUST STAND IN NEED OF NO INTERMEDIATE LEGISLATIONS BUT MUST ITSELF BE EMPOWERED TO EMPLOY THE ARM OF THE ORDINARY MAGISTRATE TO EXECUTE ITS OWN RESOLUTIONS THE MAJESTY OF THE NATIONAL AUTHORITY MUST BE MANIFESTED THROUGH THE MEDIUM
1387-130989-0025 OF THE COURTS OF JUSTICE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNION LIKE THAT OF EACH STATE MUST BE ABLE TO ADDRESS ITSELF IMMEDIATELY TO THE HOPES AND FEARS OF INDIVIDUALS AND TO ATTRACT TO ITS SUPPORT THOSE PASSIONS WHICH HAVE THE STRONGEST INFLUENCE UPON THE HUMAN HEART
1387-130989-0026 IT MUST IN SHORT POSSESS ALL THE MEANS AND HAVE ARIGHT TO RESORT TO ALL THE METHODS OF EXECUTING THE POWERS WITH WHICH IT IS INTRUSTED THAT ARE POSSESSED AND EXERCISED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PARTICULAR STATES
1387-130989-0027 THE PLAUSIBILITY OF THIS OBJECTION WILL VANISH THE MOMENT WE ADVERT TO THE ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MERE NON COMPLIANCE AND A DIRECT AND ACTIVE RESISTANCE
1387-130989-0028 MAY BE DISGUISED UNDER AFFECTED BUT UNSUBSTANTIAL PROVISIONS SO AS NOT TO APPEAR AND OF COURSE NOT TO EXCITE ANY ALARM IN THE PEOPLE FOR THE SAFETY OF THE CONSTITUTION
1387-130989-0029 THE STATE LEADERS MAY EVEN MAKE A MERIT OF THEIR SURREPTITIOUS INVASIONS OF IT ON THE GROUND OF SOME TEMPORARY CONVENIENCE EXEMPTION OR ADVANTAGE
1387-130989-0030 BUT IF THE EXECUTION OF THE LAWS OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT REQUIRE THE INTERVENTION OF THE STATE LEGISLATURES IF THEY WERE TO PASS INTO IMMEDIATE OPERATION UPON THE CITIZENS THEMSELVES
1387-130989-0031 THE PARTICULAR GOVERNMENTS COULD NOT INTERRUPT THEIR PROGRESS WITHOUT AN OPEN AND VIOLENT EXERTION OF AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL POWER NO OMISSIONS NOR EVASIONS WOULD ANSWER THE END
1387-130989-0032 AND IN SUCH A MANNER AS WOULD LEAVE NO DOUBT THAT THEY HAD ENCROACHED ON THE NATIONAL RIGHTS AN EXPERIMENT OF THIS NATURE WOULD ALWAYS BE HAZARDOUS IN THE FACE OF A CONSTITUTION IN ANY DEGREE COMPETENT TO ITS OWN DEFENSE
1387-130989-0033 AND OF A PEOPLE ENLIGHTENED ENOUGH TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A LEGAL EXERCISE AND AN ILLEGAL USURPATION OF AUTHORITY
1387-130989-0034 BUT THE CONCURRENCE OF THE COURTS OF JUSTICE AND OF THE BODY OF THE PEOPLE IF THE JUDGES WERE NOT EMBARKED IN A CONSPIRACY WITH THE LEGISLATURE THEY WOULD PRONOUNCE THE RESOLUTIONS OF SUCH A MAJORITY TO BE CONTRARY TO THE SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND VOID
1387-130989-0035 IF OPPOSITION TO THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ARISE FROM THE DISORDERLY CONDUCT OF REFRACTORY OR SEDITIOUS INDIVIDUALS IT COULD BE OVERCOME BY THE SAME MEANS WHICH ARE DAILY EMPLOYED AGAINST THE SAME EVIL UNDER THE STATE GOVERNMENTS
1387-130989-0036 THE MAGISTRACY BEING EQUALLY THE MINISTERS OF THE LAW OF THE LAND FROM WHATEVER SOURCE IT MIGHT EMANATE WOULD DOUBTLESS BE AS READY TO GUARD THE NATIONAL AS THE LOCAL REGULATIONS FROM THE INROADS OF PRIVATE LICENTIOUSNESS AS
1387-130989-0037 TO THOSE PARTIAL COMMOTIONS AND INSURRECTIONS WHICH SOMETIMES DISQUIET SOCIETY FROM THE INTRIGUES OF AN INCONSIDERABLE FACTION OR FROM SUDDEN OR OCCASIONAL ILLHUMORS
1387-130989-0038 THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT COULD COMMAND MORE EXTENSIVE RESOURCES FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF DISTURBANCES OF THAT KIND THAN WOULD BE IN THE POWER OF ANY SINGLE MEMBER AND AS TO THOSE MORTAL FEUDS WHICH IN CERTAIN CONJUNCTURES SPREAD A CONFLAGRATION THROUGH A WHOLE NATION
1387-130989-0039 WHEN THEY HAPPEN THEY COMMONLY AMOUNT TO REVOLUTIONS AND DISMEMBERMENTS OF EMPIRE NO FORM OF GOVERNMENT CAN ALWAYS EITHER AVOID OR CONTROL THEM IT IS IN VAIN TO HOPE TO GUARD AGAINST EVENTS TOO MIGHTY FOR HUMAN FORESIGHT OR PRECAUTION
