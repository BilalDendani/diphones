4443-24511-0000 AS TO HOW THE CANON OF THE OLD TESTAMENT WAS FORMED THAT IS HOW AND WHEN DID THE JEWS FIRST BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE BOOKS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT WERE INSPIRED BY GOD ABOUT THE FIRST FIVE BOOKS
4443-24511-0001 THE BOOKS OF THE LAW THERE HAD NEVER BEEN ANY QUESTION FROM THE VERY EARLIEST TIMES THOSE BOOKS SO WONDERFULLY GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN THE STRENGTH AND STAY OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL
4443-24511-0002 BUT MANY BOOKS HAD BEEN WRITTEN IN THE DAYS OF THE OLD JEWISH KINGS AND ALSO AFTER THE RETURN OF THE PEOPLE FROM BABYLON SOME OF THESE WERE VERY BEAUTIFUL AND HELPFUL
4443-24511-0003 HOW WERE THE SACRED SCRIPTURES FIRST DIVIDED FROM THE OTHER JEWISH WRITINGS WE DO NOT KNOW SOME HAVE THOUGHT THAT EZRA THE SCRIBE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A COUNCIL OF ELDERS FIXED THE CANON OF HEBREW SCRIPTURE
4443-24511-0004 OTHERS HAVE SUPPOSED NEHEMIAH TO HAVE UNDERTAKEN THE WORK BUT MOST LIKELY IT WAS A GRADUAL PROCESS DIRECTED BY GOD HIMSELF WHO INSPIRED HIS SERVANTS TO CARRY OUT HIS WILL THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE IS COMPOSED OF TWO PARTS
4443-24511-0005 THE OLD AND THE NEW TESTAMENT BUT THE JEWS DIVIDED THEIR SCRIPTURES OUR OLD TESTAMENT INTO THREE PARTS AND THEY CERTAINLY LOOKED UPON SOME BOOKS AS FAR MORE SACRED THAN OTHERS THE TORAH' THAT IS THE LAW
4443-24511-0006 INCLUDED AS WE HAVE SEEN THE FIRST FIVE BOOKS OF THE BIBLE FROM THE VERY EARLIEST DAYS THE TORAH WAS REVERENCED AS CONTAINING THE COMMANDMENTS AND PROMISES OF GOD THE SECOND DIVISION CONSISTED OF THE PROPHETS
4443-24511-0007 THESE BEING SUBDIVIDED INTO THE FORMER PROPHETS FOUR VOLUMES JOSHUA JUDGES SAMUEL KINGS AND THE LATTER PROPHETS THREE VOLUMES ISAIAH JEREMIAH
4443-24511-0008 EZEKIEL AND THE TWELVE MINOR PROPHETS WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN ONE BOOK NEXT IN ORDER OF SANCTITY CAME THE THIRD DIVISION THE WRITINGS AND THESE AGAIN WERE SUBDIVIDED INTO THREE GROUPS
4443-24511-0009 THE POETICAL BOOKS OF THE PSALMS PROVERBS AND JOB THE ROLLS OR READINGS SEVEN VOLUMES SOLOMON'S SONG RUTH LAMENTATIONS
4443-24511-0010 ESTHER DANIEL AND ONE VOLUME CONTAINING EZRA AND NEHEMIAH AND LASTLY IN A SEPARATE BOOK CHRONICLES THUS THE WHOLE SCRIPTURES WERE CONTAINED IN TWENTY FOUR BOOKS
4443-24511-0011 INDEED NOT UNTIL THE GREEK TRANSLATION WAS MADE WERE THE BOOKS GROUPED IN THE ORDER IN WHICH WE HAVE THEM NOW AND AT THE SAME TIME THEIR NUMBER WAS INCREASED TO THIRTY NINE BY TAKING THE WRITINGS OF EACH OF THE PROPHETS SEPARATELY
4443-24511-0012 AND TREATING EZRA AND NEHEMIAH AS DIFFERENT BOOKS AND NOW GOD WHO HAS SPOKEN IN TIMES PAST BY MANY DIFFERENT WAYS AND VOICES SPOKE AT LAST TO THE NATIONS BY HIS SON
4443-24511-0013 BY WHOM ALSO HE MADE THE WORLDS HEBREWS
4443-24511-0014 LET US THINK FOR A LITTLE WHILE OF WHAT WAS BEING DONE WITH THE SCRIPTURES IN THE DAYS WHEN THE LORD JESUS LEARNT TO READ THEIR WORDS AT HIS MOTHER'S KNEE WORDS WHICH FROM FIRST TO LAST TOLD OF HIMSELF
4443-24511-0015 THE CARE THEY TOOK TO KEEP THE WORDS EXACTLY AS THEY HAD BEEN HANDED DOWN TO THEM WAS INFINITE AND GOD WHO KNOWS ALL THINGS KNEW THAT A TIME WOULD COME WHEN THE PURE HEBREW WORDS OF THE OLD BIBLE WOULD BE EAGERLY SOUGHT FOR
4443-24511-0016 AND TREASURED BY ALL WHO TRULY HONOUR HIS BOOK THEREFORE ALTHOUGH THE EYES OF THE LEARNED JEWISH SCRIBES WERE SO BLINDED THAT THEY DID NOT RECOGNIZE THEIR KING AND SAVIOUR WHEN HE CAME
4443-24511-0017 YET GOD BLESSED ALL THAT WAS TRUE IN THEIR WORK AND IT IS FROM THE HEBREW COPIES WHICH THEY MADE OF THE BOOKS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT AND NOT FROM THE SEPTUAGINT OR GREEK TRANSLATION THAT THE OLD TESTAMENT OF OUR BIBLE
4443-24511-0018 HAS COME TO US TO DAY YET
4443-24511-0019 WHILE SO CAREFUL TO PRESERVE THE WORDS OF THE SCRIPTURES THE SCRIBES AND PHARISEES FORGOT ITS SPIRIT THE VERY PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE BIBLE HAD BEEN GIVEN THEM
4443-24511-0020 A MAN MIGHT KNOW BY MEMORY EVERY LETTER OF THE BIBLE BUT UNLESS THE SPIRIT OF GOD WERE IN HIS HEART HELPING HIM TO ACT OUT IN HIS LIFE THE WORDS HE REPEATS WITH HIS LIPS
4443-24511-0021 ALL HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE BIBLE WOULD ONLY LIE AS A DEAD WEIGHT UPON HIS SOUL THE LETTER KILLETH BUT THE SPIRIT GIVETH LIFE
4443-24511-0022 SO WROTE THE APOSTLE PAUL WHO HAD AS WE KNOW BEEN EDUCATED BY THE SCRIBES AND PHARISEES AND WHEN HE WROTE THOSE WORDS HE WAS RECALLING HIS OWN EXPERIENCE
4443-24511-0023 THUS AS YEAR BY YEAR THE LEARNED JEWS THOUGHT MORE OF THE LETTERS OF THEIR BIBLE THEY SAW LESS OF ITS SPIRIT WORSE STILL THEY BEGAN TO ADD
4443-24511-0024 AND HE FEARLESSLY REBUKED THE TEACHERS OF THE LAW GRIEVED BEYOND WORDS THAT THOSE TO WHOM GOD HAD ENTRUSTED HIS BOOK SHOULD MAKE THE WORD OF GOD OF NONE EFFECT THROUGH YOUR TRADITION MARK
4443-24511-0025 HIS OWN WAY OF USING THE SCRIPTURES WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM HIS MOTHER HE HAD FIRST LEARNED TO REPEAT TEXTS FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT AND WITH HER HE HAD GONE TO THE SYNAGOGUE SABBATH BY SABBATH
4443-24511-0026 TO HEAR THE BOOKS OF THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS READ AS HE GREW OLDER HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SENT TO SCHOOL AND TAUGHT TO READ AND RECITE THE SCRIPTURES AND LONG BEFORE HE BEGAN HIMSELF TO TEACH THE PEOPLE HE HAD SO ABSORBED THE SPIRIT OF THE OLD TESTAMENT
4443-24511-0027 THAT HIS VERY THOUGHTS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN IN SCRIPTURE WORDS PERHAPS YOU HAVE WONDERED WHY THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE PROPHETS AND HEROES OF THE OLD TESTAMENT ARE SPELT SO DIFFERENTLY WHEN MENTIONED IN THE NEW
4443-24511-0028 INSTEAD OF NOAH AND SO ON THIS IS BECAUSE THE WRITERS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT QUOTED FROM THE GREEK TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLE INSTEAD OF FROM THE HEBREW NAMES CHANGE A LITTLE YOU KNOW WHEN TRANSLATED INTO OTHER LANGUAGES
4443-24511-0029 FOR INSTANCE OUR NAME OF MARY BECOMES MARIE IN FRENCH AND MARIA IN ITALIAN AND YET IT IS ALL THE WHILE THE SAME NAME SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT THIS THE SEPTUAGINT
4443-24511-0030 OR FIRST GREEK TRANSLATION WAS THE SPECIAL TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLE WHICH THE SAVIOUR USED MANY OF THE QUOTATIONS WHICH HE GAVE FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN FROM THIS TRANSLATION
4443-24511-0031 ALTHOUGH SOME SEEM TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM THE HEBREW AND OTHERS AGAIN
4443-24511-0032 CHRIST HIMSELF NO DOUBT
4443-24511-0033 TONGUE WHICH WAS A MIXED LANGUAGE AND CAME INTO USE AFTER THE JEWS RETURN FROM BABYLON
4443-24511-0034 CHALDEE IN THE BOOK OF DANIEL BUT WHILE OUR SAVIOUR CONSTANTLY QUOTED FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT HE NEVER USED ITS WORDS WITHOUT DEFINITE PURPOSE
4443-24511-0035 THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT IN HIS HANDS WAS EITHER TURNED AGAINST THE EVIL ONE OR BROUGHT DIRECTLY TO BEAR WITH OVERWHELMING FORCE ON SOME MISTAKEN TEACHING
4443-24511-0036 SIMPLE WAY IN WHICH HE REACHED THE POINT AND ONCE AND FOR ALL SWEPT AWAY THE DIFFICULTY AMAZED AND CONFOUNDED THE LEARNED JEWS AN INSTANCE OF THIS IS FOUND IN HIS WONDERFUL ANSWER TO THE SADDUCEES
4443-24511-0037 WHO DISBELIEVED IN THE RESURRECTION AS TOUCHING THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD HE SAID HAVE YE NOT READ THAT WHICH WAS SPOKEN UNTO YOU BY GOD SAYING I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM AND THE GOD OF ISAAC AND THE GOD OF JACOB
4443-24511-0038 HIS HEARERS OF COURSE HAD HEARD THESE WORDS QUOTED FROM CHILDHOOD BUT NOT TILL THE SAVIOUR EXPLAINED THEIR FULL SIGNIFICANCE GOD IS NOT THE GOD OF THE DEAD BUT OF THE LIVING DID THEY REALIZE
4443-24511-0039 THAT IN THE FIRST RECORDED WORDS SPOKEN BY GOD TO MOSES LAY A PROOF OF THE RESURRECTION AND OF LIFE AFTER DEATH LET US TAKE A LOOK AT THE FIRST TIME IN WHICH CHRIST PUBLICLY READ AND EXPLAINED THE SCRIPTURES
4443-24511-0040 THE ROLL OF THE BOOK OF THE PROPHET ISAIAH LISTEN THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME BECAUSE HE HATH ANOINTED ME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE POOR HE HATH SENT ME TO HEAL THE BROKEN HEARTED
4443-24511-0041 TO PREACH DELIVERANCE TO THE CAPTIVES AND RECOVERING OF SIGHT TO THE BLIND TO SET AT LIBERTY THEM THAT ARE BRUISED TO PREACH THE ACCEPTABLE YEAR OF THE LORD LUKE
4443-24511-0042 NINETEEN HE CLOSES THE BOOK AND SITS DOWN FROM THE DIM AGES OF THE PAST THOSE WORDS HAD BEEN READ IN THE LONG LONG AGES TO COME THEY WILL YET BE READ UNTIL THE WORLD SHALL CEASE TO EXIST
4443-24511-0043 AND TIME ITSELF BE KNOWN NO MORE BUT NEVER BEFORE AND NEVER AGAIN COULD THERE BE SO HEART SEARCHING OR SACRED A READING AS THIS WHEN THE SON OF GOD READ FROM HIS FATHER'S BOOK
4443-24511-0044 IN THE SIMPLE VILLAGE MEETING IN GALILEE AND YET HIS LISTENERS DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE READING EVEN AFTER HIS EXPLANATION OF THE WORDS THEY FELL UPON DEAF EARS AND RAISED ONLY ANGER AND SURPRISE
4443-24511-0045 IT WAS THEN THAT THE FIRST ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO DESTROY HIM VERSE TWENTY NINE TO HIS OWN APOSTLES ENLIGHTENED AS THEY WERE THE MESSAGE OF THE OLD TESTAMENT WAS SEALED
4443-24511-0046 UNTIL AFTER THE SAVIOUR'S RESURRECTION WHEN HE OPENED THEIR UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY MIGHT UNDERSTAND
