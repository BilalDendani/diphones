6402-62813-0000 MADE OF MUD FROM THE BED OF A RIVER OR TANK ANOTHER METHOD IS TO POUR A THOUSAND POTS OF WATER OVER THE LINGAM IN THE SIVA TEMPLE MALAS

6402-62813-0002 MOTHER FROG PLAYING IN WATER POUR RAIN BY POTSFULL THE VILLAGERS OF OTHER CASTES THEN COME AND POUR WATER OVER THE MALAS
6402-62813-0003 S NICHOLSON INFORMS ME THAT TO PRODUCE RAIN IN THE TELUGU COUNTRY TWO BOYS CAPTURE A FROG AND PUT IT INTO A BASKET WITH SOME NIM MARGOSA MELIA AZADIRACHTA LEAVES
6402-62813-0004 THEY TIE THE BASKET TO THE MIDDLE OF A STICK WHICH THEY SUPPORT ON THEIR SHOULDERS IN THIS MANNER THEY MAKE A CIRCUIT OF THE VILLAGE VISITING EVERY HOUSE SINGING THE PRAISES OF THE GOD OF RAIN THE GREATER THE NOISE THE CAPTIVE ANIMAL MAKES
6402-62813-0005 THE BETTER THE OMEN AND THE MORE GAIN FOR THE BOYS FOR AT EVERY HOUSE THEY RECEIVE SOMETHING IN RECOGNITION OF THEIR ENDEAVOURS TO BRING RAIN UPON THE VILLAGE FIELDS IN THE BELLARY DISTRICT WHEN THE RAIN FAILS THE KAPU
6402-62813-0006 TELUGU CULTIVATOR FEMALES CATCH A FROG AND TIE IT ALIVE TO A NEW WINNOWING FAN MADE OF BAMBOO ON THIS FAN LEAVING THE FROG VISIBLE THEY SPREAD A FEW MARGOSA LEAVES AND GO SINGING FROM DOOR TO DOOR
6402-62813-0007 LADY FROG MUST HAVE HER BATH OH RAIN GOD GIVE AT LEAST A LITTLE WATER FOR HER THIS MEANS THAT THE DROUGHT HAS REACHED SUCH A STAGE THAT THERE IS NOT EVEN A DROP OF WATER FOR THE FROGS
6402-62813-0008 WHEN THE KAPU FEMALE SINGS THIS SONG THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE BRINGS A LITTLE WATER IN A VESSEL POURS IT OVER THE FROG WHICH IS LEFT ON THE FAN OUTSIDE THE DOOR SILL AND GIVES SOME ALMS
6402-62813-0009 ON THE FIRST FULL MOON DAY IN THE MONTH OF BHADRAPADA SEPTEMBER THE AGRICULTURAL POPULATION IN THE BELLARY DISTRICT CELEBRATE A FESTIVAL CALLED JOKUMARA TO APPEASE THE RAIN GOD
6402-62813-0010 GO ROUND THE VILLAGE IN WHICH THEY LIVE WITH A BASKET ON THEIR HEADS CONTAINING MARGOSA LEAVES FLOWERS OF VARIOUS KINDS AND SACRED ASHES THEY BEG FOR ALMS ESPECIALLY FROM THE CULTIVATING CLASSES AND IN RETURN FOR THE ALMS BESTOWED
6402-62813-0011 USUALLY GRAIN OR FOOD THEY GIVE SOME OF THE LEAVES FLOWERS AND ASHES THE CULTIVATORS TAKE THESE TO THEIR FIELDS PREPARE CHOLAM SORGHUM KANJI OR GRUEL MIX THEM WITH IT AND SPRINKLE THE KANJI OVER THEIR FIELDS
6402-62813-0012 AFTER THIS THE CULTIVATOR PROCEEDS TO THE POTTER'S KILN IN THE VILLAGE AND FETCHES ASHES FROM IT WITH WHICH HE MAKES THE FIGURE OF A HUMAN BEING THIS FIGURE IS PLACED IN A FIELD AND CALLED JOKUMARA OR RAIN GOD
6402-62813-0013 AND IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE THE POWER OF BRINGING DOWN THE RAIN IN DUE SEASON A SECOND KIND OF JOKUMARA WORSHIP IS CALLED MUDDAM OR THE OUTLINING OF RUDE REPRESENTATIONS OF HUMAN FIGURES WITH POWDERED CHARCOAL THESE ARE MADE IN THE EARLY MORNING
6402-62813-0014 BEFORE THE BUSTLE OF THE DAY COMMENCES ON THE GROUND AT CROSS ROADS AND ALONG THOROUGHFARES
6402-62813-0015 WHO DRAW THESE FIGURES ARE PAID A SMALL REMUNERATION IN MONEY OR KIND THE FIGURES REPRESENT JOKUMARA WHO WILL BRING DOWN RAIN WHEN INSULTED BY PEOPLE TREADING ON HIM YET ANOTHER KIND OF JOKUMARA WORSHIP PREVAILS IN THE BELLARY DISTRICT
6402-62813-0016 WHEN RAIN FAILS THE KAPU FEMALES MODEL A SMALL FIGURE OF A NAKED HUMAN BEING WHICH THEY PLACE IN A MINIATURE PALANQUIN AND GO FROM DOOR TO DOOR SINGING INDECENT SONGS AND COLLECTING ALMS THEY CONTINUE THIS PROCESSION FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS
6402-62813-0017 AND THEN ABANDON THE FIGURE IN A FIELD ADJACENT TO THE VILLAGE THE MALAS TAKE POSSESSION OF THE ABANDONED JOKUMARA AND IN THEIR TURN GO ABOUT SINGING INDECENT SONGS AND COLLECTING ALMS FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS AND THEN THROW THE FIGURE AWAY IN SOME JUNGLE
6402-62813-0018 THIS FORM OF JOKUMARA WORSHIP IS ALSO BELIEVED TO BRING DOWN PLENTY OF RAIN IN THE BELLARY DISTRICT THE AGRICULTURISTS HAVE A CURIOUS SUPERSTITION ABOUT PROPHESYING THE STATE OF THE COMING SEASON THE VILLAGE OF MAILAR CONTAINS A SIVA TEMPLE
6402-62813-0019 WHICH IS FAMOUS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT FOR AN ANNUAL FESTIVAL HELD THERE IN THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY THIS FESTIVAL HAS NOW DWINDLED INTO MORE OR LESS A CATTLE FAIR BUT THE FAME OF THE TEMPLE CONTINUES AS REGARDS THE KARANIKA WHICH IS A CRYPTIC SENTENCE UTTERED BY THE PRIEST
6402-62813-0020 CONTAINING A PROPHECY OF THE PROSPECTS OF THE AGRICULTURAL SEASON THE PUJARI PRIEST OF THE TEMPLE IS A KURUBA CULTIVATING CASTE THE FEAST AT THE TEMPLE LASTS FOR TEN DAYS ON THE LAST DAY THE GOD SIVA
6402-62813-0021 IS REPRESENTED AS RETURNING VICTORIOUS FROM THE BATTLEFIELD AFTER HAVING SLAIN THE DEMON MALLA MALLASURA WITH A HUGE BOW HE IS MET HALF WAY FROM THE FIELD OF BATTLE BY THE GODDESS THE WOODEN BOW IS PLACED ON END BEFORE THE GOD
6402-62813-0022 THE KURUBA PRIEST CLIMBS UP IT AS IT IS HELD BY TWO ASSISTANTS AND THEN GETS ON THEIR SHOULDERS IN THIS POSTURE HE STANDS RAPT IN SILENCE FOR A FEW MINUTES LOOKING IN SEVERAL DIRECTIONS HE THEN BEGINS TO QUAKE AND QUIVER FROM HEAD TO FOOT
6402-62813-0023 THIS IS THE SIGN OF THE SPIRIT OF THE GOD SIVA POSSESSING HIM A SOLEMN SILENCE HOLDS THE ASSEMBLY FOR THE TIME OF THE KARANIKA HAS ARRIVED
6402-62813-0024 TO THE REMOVAL OF CERTAIN FIGURES OF THE SACRED BULL NANDI AND LINGAMS WHICH WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE FIELDS ON THE GROUND THAT THE RAINFALL WOULD CEASE IF THESE SACRED OBJECTS WERE TAKEN AWAY TO BRING DOWN RAIN
6402-62813-0025 HAVE THEIR VARUNA JAPAM OR PRAYERS TO VARUNA THE RAIN GOD SOME OF THE LOWER CLASSES INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THEIR PRAYERS TO VARUNA TRY TO INDUCE A SPIRIT OR DEVATA NAMED KODUMPAVI WICKED ONE TO SEND HER PARAMOUR SUKRA
6402-62813-0026 TO THE AFFECTED AREA THE BELIEF SEEMS TO BE THAT SUKRA GOES AWAY TO HIS CONCUBINAGE FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS
6402-62813-0027 THE CEREMONY CONSISTS IN MAKING A HUGE FIGURE OF KODUMPAVI IN CLAY WHICH IS PLACED ON A CART AND DRAGGED THROUGH THE STREETS FOR SEVEN TO TEN DAYS ON THE LAST DAY THE FINAL DEATH CEREMONIES OF THE FIGURE ARE CELEBRATED IT IS DISFIGURED
6402-62813-0028 ESPECIALLY IN THOSE PARTS WHICH ARE USUALLY CONCEALED VETTIYANS PARAIYAN GRAVE DIGGERS WHO HAVE BEEN SHAVED ACCOMPANY THE FIGURE AND PERFORM THE FUNERAL CEREMONIES THIS PROCEDURE IS BELIEVED TO PUT KODUMPAVI TO SHAME
6402-62813-0029 AND TO GET HER TO INDUCE SUKRA TO RETURN AND STAY THE DROUGHT
6402-62813-0030 WHICH IS MADE OF CLAY OR STRAW IS DRAGGED FEET FIRST THROUGH THE VILLAGE BY THE PARAIYANS WHO ACCOMPANY IT WAILING AS THOUGH THEY WERE AT A FUNERAL AND BEATING DRUMS IN FUNERAL TIME I AM INFORMED BY MISTER F R HEMINGWAY THAT WHEN RAIN IS WANTED IN
6402-62813-0031 THE TRICHINOPOLY DISTRICT AN EFFIGY CALLED KOMAN THE KING IS DRAGGED ROUND THE STREETS AND ITS FUNERAL PERFORMED WITH GREAT ATTENTION TO DETAILS OR AN EFFIGY OF KODUMPAVI IS TREATED WITH CONTUMELY
6402-62813-0032 IN SOME PLACES THE WOMEN COLLECT KANJI RICE GRUEL FROM DOOR TO DOOR AND DRINK IT OR THROW IT AWAY ON A TANK BUND EMBANKMENT WAILING THE WHILE AS THEY DO AT FUNERALS PEOPLE OF THE HIGHER CASTES REPEAT PRAYERS TO VARUNA
6402-62813-0033 AND READ PORTIONS OF THE VIRATA PARVAM IN THE MAHABHARATA IN THE HOPE THAT THE LAND WILL BE AS FERTILE AS THE COUNTRY OF THE VIRATS WHERE THE PANDAVAS LIVED WHEN THE TANKS AND RIVERS THREATEN TO BREACH THEIR BANKS MEN STAND NAKED ON THE BUND AND BEAT DRUMS
6402-62813-0034 AND IF TOO MUCH RAIN FALLS NAKED MEN POINT FIREBRANDS AT THE SKY THEIR NUDITY IS SUPPOSED TO SHOCK THE POWERS THAT BRING THE RAIN
6402-62813-0035 FOR A FEW DAYS THERE WERE COLD WINDS AND SOME LIGHTNING BUT ALAS THE JAPAM WAS OVER AND WITH THAT DISAPPEARED ALL SIGNS OF GETTING ANY SHOWERS IN THE NEAR FUTURE IT IS NOTED BY HADDON
6402-62813-0036 THE IMPOSSIBLE IS NEVER ATTEMPTED AND A RAIN CHARM WOULD NOT BE MADE WHEN THERE WAS NO EXPECTATION OF RAIN COMING OR DURING THE WRONG SEASON THERE IS IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY A BELIEF THAT IF LEPERS ARE BURIED WHEN THEY DIE
6402-62813-0037 RAIN WILL NOT VISIT THE LOCALITY WHERE THEIR CORPSES HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED SO THEY DISINTER THE BODIES AND THROW THE REMAINS THEREOF INTO THE RIVER OR BURN THEM
6402-62813-0038 HIS SKELETON WAS DISINTERRED PUT INTO A BASKET AND HUNG TO A TREE WITH A GARLAND OF FLOWERS ROUND ITS NECK
6402-62813-0039 WHICH THEY SPIT OUT TO PRODUCE RAIN IN THE RAINY SEASON
