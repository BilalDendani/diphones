5115-26947-0000 THE SHEAVES OF BANNERS WERE UNFURLED AT THE ANGLES OF THE BAPTISTERY BUT THERE WAS NO CARPET YET ON THE STEPS OF THE DUOMO
5115-26947-0001 WERE REASONS WHY THE PREACHING IN THE DUOMO COULD LEAST OF ALL BE DISPENSED WITH BUT NOT ALL THE FEET IN THE PIAZZA WERE HASTENING TOWARDS THE STEPS PEOPLE OF HIGH AND LOW DEGREE WERE MOVING TO AND FRO WITH THE BRISK PACE OF MEN WHO HAD ERRANDS BEFORE THEM
5115-26947-0002 GROUPS OF TALKERS WERE THICKLY SCATTERED SOME WILLING TO BE LATE FOR THE SERMON AND OTHERS CONTENT NOT TO HEAR IT AT ALL THE EXPRESSION ON THE FACES OF THESE APPARENT LOUNGERS WAS NOT THAT OF MEN WHO ARE ENJOYING THE PLEASANT LAZINESS OF AN OPENING HOLIDAY SOME WERE IN CLOSE AND EAGER DISCUSSION
5115-26947-0003 OTHERS WERE LISTENING WITH KEEN INTEREST TO A SINGLE SPOKESMAN AND YET FROM TIME TO TIME TURNED ROUND WITH A SCANNING GLANCE AT ANY NEW PASSER BY
5115-26947-0004 JUST WHERE THE ARTIFICIAL RAINBOW LIGHT OF THE PIAZZA CEASED AND THE GREY MORNING FELL ON THE SOMBRE STONE HOUSES THERE WAS A REMARKABLE CLUSTER OF THE WORKING PEOPLE MOST OF THEM BEARING ON THEIR DRESS OR PERSONS THE SIGNS OF THEIR DAILY LABOUR AND ALMOST ALL OF THEM CARRYING SOME WEAPON
5115-26947-0005 OR SOME TOOL WHICH MIGHT SERVE AS A WEAPON UPON OCCASION STANDING IN THE GREY LIGHT OF THE STREET WITH BARE BRAWNY ARMS AND SOILED GARMENTS THEY MADE ALL THE MORE STRIKING THE TRANSITION FROM THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE PIAZZA
5115-26947-0006 WHO HAD JUST PAUSED ON HIS WAY TO THE DUOMO
5115-26947-0007 BUT NOW HE SPOKE WITH THE MORE COMPLACENT HUMOUR OF A MAN WHOSE PARTY IS UPPERMOST AND WHO IS CONSCIOUS OF SOME INFLUENCE WITH THE PEOPLE NEVER TALK TO ME HE WAS SAYING IN HIS INCISIVE VOICE NEVER TALK TO ME OF BLOODTHIRSTY SWISS OR FIERCE FRENCH INFANTRY
5115-26947-0008 THEY MIGHT AS WELL BE IN THE NARROW PASSES OF THE MOUNTAINS AS IN OUR STREETS AND PEASANTS HAVE DESTROYED THE FINEST ARMIES OF OUR CONDOTTIERI IN TIME PAST WHEN THEY HAD ONCE GOT THEM BETWEEN STEEP PRECIPICES I TELL YOU FLORENTINES NEED BE AFRAID OF NO ARMY IN THEIR OWN STREETS
5115-26947-0009 LOOKING ROUND AS IF THEY THOUGHT THE HOUSES OF THE VESPUCCI AND THE AGLI A POOR PICK OF LODGINGS FOR THEM AND EYEING US FLORENTINES LIKE TOP KNOTTED COCKS AS THEY ARE AS IF THEY PITIED US BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO STRUT YES MY FINE GALLI SAYS I
5115-26947-0010 WHEN PRESENTLY THE OLD COW LOWED NOTE ONE
5115-26947-0011 AND I KNEW SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED NO MATTER WHAT SO I THREW MY CLOTH IN AT THE FIRST DOORWAY AND TOOK HOLD OF MY MEAT AXE AND RAN AFTER MY FINE CAVALIERS TOWARDS THE VIGNA NUOVA AND WHAT IS IT GUCCIO SAID I WHEN HE CAME UP WITH ME I THINK IT'S THE MEDICI COMING BACK
5115-26947-0012 SAID GUCCIO BEMBE I EXPECTED SO AND UP WE REARED A BARRICADE AND THE FRENCHMEN LOOKED BEHIND AND SAW THEMSELVES IN A TRAP AND UP COMES A GOOD SWARM OF OUR CIOMPI NOTE TWO
5115-26947-0013 IT'S TRUE AND THE LASSES PEPPERED A FEW STONES DOWN TO FRIGHTEN THEM
5115-26947-0014 FOR WE'D HAVE LEFT HIM NEITHER LEGS NOR WINGS TO GO AWAY WITH AGAIN WELL SPOKEN ODDO SAID A YOUNG BUTCHER WITH HIS KNIFE AT HIS BELT AND IT'S MY BELIEF PIERO WILL BE A GOOD WHILE BEFORE HE WANTS TO COME BACK FOR HE LOOKED AS FRIGHTENED AS A HUNTED CHICKEN WHEN WE HUSTLED AND PELTED HIM IN THE PIAZZA
5115-26947-0015 HE'S A COWARD ELSE HE MIGHT HAVE MADE A BETTER STAND WHEN HE'D GOT HIS HORSEMEN BUT WE'LL SWALLOW NO MEDICI ANY MORE WHATEVER ELSE THE FRENCH KING WANTS TO MAKE US SWALLOW BUT I LIKE NOT THOSE FRENCH CANNON THEY TALK OF SAID GORO
5115-26947-0016 WHY SHOULDN'T HE HAVE SENT THE FRENCH ANOTHER WAY TO NAPLES AY GORO SAID THE DYER THAT'S A QUESTION WORTH PUTTING THOU ART NOT SUCH A PUMPKIN HEAD AS I TOOK THEE FOR
5115-26947-0017 BUT HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE EXCLAMATION LOOK THERE WHICH BURST FROM SEVERAL VOICES AT ONCE
5115-26947-0018 IN SOME CONTEMPT AT THIS INTERRUPTION HE PRETENDS TO LOOK WELL SATISFIED THAT DEEP TORNABUONI
5115-26947-0019 FOR THERE WAS NOT ONLY THE DISTINGUISHED PRESENCE OF LORENZO TORNABUONI AND THE SPLENDID COSTUME OF THE FRENCHMAN WITH HIS ELABORATELY DISPLAYED WHITE LINEN AND GORGEOUS EMBROIDERY THERE WERE TWO OTHER FLORENTINES OF HIGH BIRTH IN HANDSOME DRESSES DONNED FOR THE COMING PROCESSION
5115-26947-0020 AND ON THE LEFT HAND OF THE FRENCHMAN WAS A FIGURE THAT WAS NOT TO BE ECLIPSED BY ANY AMOUNT OF INTENTION OR BROCADE A FIGURE WE HAVE OFTEN SEEN BEFORE HE WORE NOTHING BUT BLACK FOR HE WAS IN MOURNING
5115-26947-0021 FOR HE TOO WAS TO WALK IN PROCESSION AS LATIN SECRETARY TO THE TEN TITO MELEMA HAD BECOME CONSPICUOUSLY SERVICEABLE IN THE INTERCOURSE WITH THE FRENCH GUESTS FROM HIS FAMILIARITY WITH SOUTHERN ITALY AND HIS READINESS IN THE FRENCH TONGUE WHICH HE HAD SPOKEN IN HIS EARLY YOUTH
5115-26947-0022 THE LUSTRE OF GOOD FORTUNE WAS UPON HIM HE WAS SMILING LISTENING AND EXPLAINING WITH HIS USUAL GRACEFUL UNPRETENTIOUS EASE AND ONLY A VERY KEEN EYE BENT ON STUDYING HIM COULD HAVE MARKED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CHANGE IN HIM WHICH WAS NOT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE LAPSE OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS
5115-26947-0023 BUT THE GAZE WAS NOT ENTIRELY CORDIAL AND ADMIRING
5115-26947-0024 DELICATE FLATTERY OF ROYAL SUPERFLUITY IN TOES
5115-26947-0025 BUT LORENZO TORNABUONI POSSESSED THAT POWER OF DISSEMBLING ANNOYANCE WHICH IS DEMANDED IN A MAN WHO COURTS POPULARITY AND TITO BESIDES HIS NATURAL DISPOSITION TO OVERCOME ILL WILL BY GOOD HUMOUR HAD THE UNIMPASSIONED FEELING OF
5115-26947-0026 THE ALIEN TOWARDS NAMES AND DETAILS THAT MOVE THE DEEPEST PASSIONS OF THE NATIVE ARRIVED WHERE THEY COULD GET A GOOD OBLIQUE VIEW OF THE DUOMO THE PARTY PAUSED THE FESTOONS AND DEVICES PLACED OVER THE CENTRAL DOORWAY EXCITED SOME DEMUR AND TORNABUONI BECKONED TO PIERO DI COSIMO
5115-26947-0027 WHO AS WAS USUAL WITH HIM AT THIS HOUR WAS LOUNGING IN FRONT OF NELLO'S SHOP THERE WAS SOON AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION AND IT BECAME HIGHLY AMUSING FROM THE FRENCHMAN'S ASTONISHMENT AT PICRO'S ODD PUNGENCY OF STATEMENT WHICH TITO TRANSLATED LITERALLY
5115-26947-0028 HALF HUMILIATED EXPRESSION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT WITHIN HEARING OF THE JOKE WHICH IS PRODUCING INFECTIOUS LAUGHTER IT WAS A DELIGHTFUL MOMENT FOR TITO FOR HE WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHO COULD HAVE MADE SO AMUSING AN INTERPRETER
5115-26947-0029 BUT THEY WERE BEING PRESSED UPON BY A LARGER AND LARGER NUMBER OF NON ADMIRING FLORENTINES IN THE VAN OF THE CROWD WERE THREE MEN IN SCANTY CLOTHING EACH HAD HIS HANDS BOUND TOGETHER BY A CORD AND A ROPE WAS FASTENED ROUND HIS NECK AND BODY IN SUCH A WAY THAT HE WHO HELD THE EXTREMITY OF THE ROPE
5115-26947-0030 MIGHT EASILY CHECK ANY REBELLIOUS MOVEMENT BY THE THREAT OF THROTTLING THE MEN WHO HELD THE ROPES WERE FRENCH SOLDIERS AND BY BROKEN ITALIAN PHRASES AND STROKES FROM THE KNOTTED END OF THE ROPE THEY FROM TIME TO TIME STIMULATED THEIR PRISONERS TO BEG
5115-26947-0031 HAD HELD OUT THEIR BOUND HANDS AND SAID IN PITEOUS TONES FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND THE HOLY MADONNA GIVE US SOMETHING TOWARDS OUR RANSOM WE ARE TUSCANS WE WERE MADE PRISONERS IN LUNIGIANA BUT THE THIRD MAN REMAINED OBSTINATELY SILENT UNDER ALL THE STROKES FROM THE KNOTTED CORD
5115-26947-0032 HE WAS VERY DIFFERENT IN ASPECT FROM HIS TWO FELLOW PRISONERS THEY WERE YOUNG AND HARDY AND IN THE SCANT CLOTHING WHICH THE AVARICE OF THEIR CAPTORS HAD LEFT THEM LOOKED LIKE VULGAR STURDY MENDICANTS BUT HE HAD PASSED THE BOUNDARY OF OLD AGE AND COULD HARDLY BE LESS THAN FOUR OR FIVE AND SIXTY
5115-26947-0033 IN THE MIDST OF HIS YELLOW BLOODLESS DEEP WRINKLED FACE WITH ITS LANK GREY HAIRS AND YET THERE WAS SOMETHING FITFUL IN THE EYES WHICH CONTRADICTED THE OCCASIONAL FLASH OF ENERGY AFTER LOOKING ROUND WITH QUICK FIERCENESS AT WINDOWS AND FACES THEY FELL AGAIN WITH A LOST AND WANDERING LOOK
5115-26947-0034 BUT HIS LIPS WERE MOTIONLESS AND HE HELD HIS HANDS RESOLUTELY DOWN HE WOULD NOT BEG THIS SIGHT HAD BEEN WITNESSED BY THE FLORENTINES WITH GROWING EXASPERATION MANY STANDING AT THEIR DOORS OR PASSING QUIETLY ALONG HAD AT ONCE GIVEN MONEY
5115-26947-0035 SOME IN HALF AUTOMATIC RESPONSE TO AN APPEAL IN THE NAME OF GOD OTHERS IN THAT UNQUESTIONING AWE OF THE FRENCH SOLDIERY WHICH HAD BEEN CREATED BY THE REPORTS OF THEIR CRUEL WARFARE AND ON WHICH THE FRENCH THEMSELVES COUNTED AS A GUARANTEE OF IMMUNITY IN THEIR ACTS OF INSOLENCE
5115-26947-0036 THAT COMPLIANCE HAD GRADUALLY DISAPPEARED AND THE SOLDIERS FOUND THEMSELVES ESCORTED BY A GATHERING TROOP OF MEN AND BOYS
5115-26947-0037 INTELLIGIBLE TO FOREIGN EARS WITHOUT ANY INTERPRETER THE SOLDIERS THEMSELVES BEGAN TO DISLIKE THEIR POSITION FOR WITH A STRONG INCLINATION TO USE THEIR WEAPONS THEY WERE CHECKED BY THE NECESSITY FOR KEEPING A SECURE HOLD ON THEIR PRISONERS AND THEY WERE NOW HURRYING ALONG IN THE HOPE OF FINDING SHELTER IN A HOSTELRY
5115-26947-0038 FRENCH DOGS BULLOCK FEET SNATCH THEIR PIKES FROM THEM CUT THE CORDS AND MAKE THEM RUN FOR THEIR PRISONERS THEY'LL RUN AS FAST AS GEESE DON'T YOU SEE THEY'RE WEB FOOTED THESE WERE THE CRIES WHICH THE SOLDIERS VAGUELY UNDERSTOOD TO BE JEERS AND PROBABLY THREATS
5115-26947-0039 SANTIDDIO HERE'S A SIGHT SAID THE DYER AS SOON AS HE HAD DIVINED THE MEANING OF THE ADVANCING TUMULT AND THE FOOLS DO NOTHING BUT HOOT COME ALONG HE ADDED SNATCHING HIS AXE FROM HIS BELT AND RUNNING TO JOIN THE CROWD
5115-26947-0040 FOLLOWED BY THE BUTCHER AND ALL THE REST OF HIS COMPANIONS EXCEPT GORO WHO HASTILY RETREATED UP A NARROW PASSAGE THE SIGHT OF THE DYER RUNNING FORWARD WITH BLOOD RED ARMS AND AXE UPLIFTED AND WITH HIS CLUSTER OF ROUGH COMPANIONS BEHIND HIM HAD A STIMULATING EFFECT ON THE CROWD NOT THAT HE DID ANYTHING ELSE
5115-26947-0041 THAN PASS BEYOND THE SOLDIERS AND THRUST HIMSELF WELL AMONG HIS FELLOW CITIZENS FLOURISHING HIS AXE BUT HE SERVED AS A STIRRING SYMBOL OF STREET FIGHTING LIKE THE WAVING OF A WELL KNOWN GONFALON AND THE FIRST SIGN THAT FIRE WAS READY TO BURST OUT WAS SOMETHING AS RAPID AS A LITTLE LEAPING TONGUE OF FLAME
5115-26947-0042 WHO WAS DANCING AND JEERING IN FRONT OF THE INGENUOUS BOYS THAT MADE THE MAJORITY OF THE CROWD LOLLO HAD NO GREAT COMPASSION FOR THE PRISONERS BUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF AN EXCELLENT KNIFE WHICH WAS HIS UNFAILING COMPANION IT HAD SEEMED TO HIM FROM THE FIRST THAT TO JUMP FORWARD
5115-26947-0043 CUT A ROPE AND LEAP BACK AGAIN BEFORE THE SOLDIER WHO HELD IT COULD USE HIS WEAPON WOULD BE AN AMUSING AND DEXTEROUS PIECE OF MISCHIEF AND NOW WHEN THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO HOOT AND JOSTLE MORE VIGOROUSLY LOLLO FELT THAT HIS MOMENT WAS COME HE WAS CLOSE TO THE ELDEST PRISONER IN AN INSTANT HE HAD CUT THE CORD
5115-26947-0044 THE PRISONER'S SENSATIONS WERE NOT TOO SLOW FOR HIM TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY
5115-26947-0045 HE RAN AT ONCE BUT HIS SPEED WOULD HARDLY HAVE SUFFICED FOR HIM IF THE FLORENTINES HAD NOT INSTANTANEOUSLY RUSHED BETWEEN HIM AND HIS CAPTOR HE RAN ON INTO THE PIAZZA BUT HE QUICKLY HEARD THE TRAMP OF FEET BEHIND HIM FOR THE OTHER TWO PRISONERS HAD BEEN RELEASED AND THE SOLDIERS WERE STRUGGLING AND FIGHTING THEIR WAY AFTER THEM
5115-26947-0046 IMPEDED BUT NOT VERY RESOLUTELY ATTACKED BY THE PEOPLE ONE OF THE TWO YOUNGER PRISONERS TURNED LIP THE BORGO DI SAN LORENZO AND THUS MADE A PARTIAL DIVERSION OF THE HUBBUB
5115-26947-0047 THE CAUSE COULD NOT BE PRECISELY GUESSED FOR THE FRENCH DRESS WAS SCREENED BY THE IMPEDING CROWD
5115-26947-0048 BUT THE OBJECT OF HIS PURSUIT HAD TAKEN THE OTHER DIRECTION THAT OBJECT WAS THE ELDEST PRISONER WHO HAD WHEELED ROUND THE BAPTISTERY AND WAS RUNNING TOWARDS THE DUOMO DETERMINED TO TAKE REFUGE IN THAT SANCTUARY RATHER THAN TRUST TO HIS SPEED BUT IN MOUNTING THE STEPS HIS FOOT RECEIVED A SHOCK
5115-26947-0049 IT WAS TITO MELEMA WHO FELT THAT CLUTCH
5115-26947-0050 THE TWO MEN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER SILENT AS DEATH BALDASSARRE WITH DARK FIERCENESS AND A TIGHTENING GRIP OF THE SOILED WORN HANDS ON THE VELVET CLAD ARM TITO WITH CHEEKS AND LIPS ALL BLOODLESS FASCINATED BY TERROR IT SEEMED A LONG WHILE TO THEM IT WAS BUT A MOMENT
5115-26947-0051 THE FIRST SOUND TITO HEARD WAS THE SHORT LAUGH OF PIERO DI COSIMO WHO STOOD CLOSE BY HIM AND WAS THE ONLY PERSON THAT COULD SEE HIS FACE HA HA I KNOW WHAT A GHOST SHOULD BE NOW THIS IS ANOTHER ESCAPED PRISONER SAID LORENZO TORNABUONI WHO IS HE I WONDER SOME MADMAN SURELY SAID TITO
5115-26947-0052 HE HARDLY KNEW HOW THE WORDS HAD COME TO HIS LIPS
