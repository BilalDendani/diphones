4738-58078-0000 INTO THE OPEN AIR JOHN ALDEN PERPLEXED AND BEWILDERED RUSHED LIKE A MAN INSANE AND WANDERED ALONE BY THE SEA SIDE PACED UP AND DOWN THE SANDS AND BARED HIS HEAD TO THE EAST WIND
4738-58078-0001 COOLING HIS HEATED BROW AND THE FIRE AND FEVER WITHIN HIM SLOWLY AS OUT OF THE HEAVENS WITH APOCALYPTICAL SPLENDORS SANK THE CITY OF GOD IN THE VISION OF JOHN THE APOSTLE
4738-58078-0002 SO WITH ITS CLOUDY WALLS OF CHRYSOLITE JASPER AND SAPPHIRE SANK THE BROAD RED SUN AND OVER ITS TURRETS UPLIFTED GLIMMERED THE GOLDEN REED OF THE ANGEL WHO MEASURED THE CITY
4738-58078-0003 WELCOME O WIND OF THE EAST HE EXCLAIMED IN HIS WILD EXULTATION WELCOME O WIND OF THE EAST FROM THE CAVES OF THE MISTY ATLANTIC BLOWING O'ER FIELDS OF DULSE AND MEASURELESS MEADOWS OF SEA GRASS
4738-58078-0004 BLOWING O'ER ROCKY WASTES AND THE GROTTOS AND GARDENS OF OCEAN LAY THY COLD MOIST HAND ON MY BURNING FOREHEAD AND WRAP ME CLOSE IN THY GARMENTS OF MIST TO ALLAY THE FEVER WITHIN ME
4738-58078-0005 LIKE AN AWAKENED CONSCIENCE THE SEA WAS MOANING AND TOSSING BEATING REMORSEFUL AND LOUD THE MUTABLE SANDS OF THE SEA SHORE FIERCE IN HIS SOUL WAS THE STRUGGLE AND TUMULT OF PASSIONS CONTENDING
4738-58078-0006 LOVE TRIUMPHANT AND CROWNED AND FRIENDSHIP WOUNDED AND BLEEDING PASSIONATE CRIES OF DESIRE AND IMPORTUNATE PLEADINGS OF DUTY IS IT MY FAULT HE SAID THAT THE MAIDEN HAS CHOSEN BETWEEN US
4738-58078-0007 IS IT MY FAULT THAT HE FAILED MY FAULT THAT I AM THE VICTOR THEN WITHIN HIM THERE THUNDERED A VOICE LIKE THE VOICE OF THE PROPHET IT HATH DISPLEASED THE LORD
4738-58078-0008 AND HE THOUGHT OF DAVID'S TRANSGRESSION BATHSHEBA'S BEAUTIFUL FACE AND HIS FRIEND IN THE FRONT OF THE BATTLE SHAME AND CONFUSION OF GUILT AND ABASEMENT AND SELF CONDEMNATION
4738-58078-0009 OVERWHELMED HIM AT ONCE AND HE CRIED IN THE DEEPEST CONTRITION IT HATH DISPLEASED THE LORD IT IS THE TEMPTATION OF SATAN THEN UPLIFTING HIS HEAD HE LOOKED AT THE SEA
4738-58078-0010 AND BEHELD THERE DIMLY THE SHADOWY FORM OF THE MAYFLOWER RIDING AT ANCHOR ROCKED ON THE RISING TIDE AND READY TO SAIL ON THE MORROW HEARD THE VOICES OF MEN THROUGH THE MIST THE RATTLE OF CORDAGE THROWN ON THE DECK
4738-58078-0011 CLEAR AND DISTINCT BUT NOT LOUD IN THE DRIPPING AIR OF THE TWILIGHT STILL FOR A MOMENT HE STOOD AND LISTENED AND STARED AT THE VESSEL THEN WENT HURRIEDLY ON AS ONE WHO SEEING A PHANTOM
4738-58078-0012 STOPS THEN QUICKENS HIS PACE AND FOLLOWS THE BECKONING SHADOW YES IT IS PLAIN TO ME NOW HE MURMURED THE HAND OF THE LORD IS LEADING ME OUT OF THE LAND OF DARKNESS THE BONDAGE OF ERROR
4738-58078-0013 THROUGH THE SEA THAT SHALL LIFT THE WALLS OF ITS WATERS AROUND ME HIDING ME CUTTING ME OFF FROM THE CRUEL THOUGHTS THAT PURSUE ME BACK WILL I GO O'ER THE OCEAN THIS DREARY LAND WILL ABANDON HER WHOM I MAY NOT LOVE
4738-58078-0014 BETTER TO BE IN MY GRAVE IN THE GREEN OLD CHURCHYARD IN ENGLAND CLOSE BY MY MOTHER'S SIDE AND AMONG THE DUST OF MY KINDRED BETTER BE DEAD AND FORGOTTEN THAN LIVING IN SHAME AND DISHONOR
4738-58078-0015 SACRED AND SAFE AND UNSEEN IN THE DARK OF THE NARROW CHAMBER WITH ME MY SECRET SHALL LIE LIKE A BURIED JEWEL THAT GLIMMERS BRIGHT ON THE HAND THAT IS DUST IN THE CHAMBERS OF SILENCE AND DARKNESS
4738-58078-0016 YES AS THE MARRIAGE RING OF THE GREAT ESPOUSAL HEREAFTER THUS AS HE SPAKE HE TURNED IN THE STRENGTH OF HIS STRONG RESOLUTION LEAVING BEHIND HIM THE SHORE AND HURRIED ALONG IN THE TWILIGHT
4738-58078-0017 TILL HE BEHELD THE LIGHTS IN THE SEVEN HOUSES OF PLYMOUTH SHINING LIKE SEVEN STARS IN THE DUSK AND MIST OF THE EVENING SOON HE ENTERED HIS DOOR AND FOUND THE REDOUBTABLE CAPTAIN SITTING ALONE
4738-58078-0018 AND ABSORBED IN THE MARTIAL PAGES OF CAESAR FIGHTING SOME GREAT CAMPAIGN IN HAINAULT OR BRABANT OR FLANDERS LONG HAVE YOU BEEN ON YOUR ERRAND HE SAID WITH A CHEERY DEMEANOR
4738-58078-0019 EVEN AS ONE WHO IS WAITING AN ANSWER AND FEARS NOT THE ISSUE
4738-58078-0020 BUT YOU HAVE LINGERED SO LONG THAT WHILE YOU WERE GOING AND COMING I HAVE FOUGHT TEN BATTLES AND SACKED AND DEMOLISHED A CITY COME SIT DOWN AND IN ORDER RELATE TO ME ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED
4738-58078-0021 THEN JOHN ALDEN SPAKE AND RELATED THE WONDROUS ADVENTURE FROM BEGINNING TO END MINUTELY JUST AS IT HAPPENED HOW HE HAD SEEN PRISCILLA AND HOW HE HAD SPED IN HIS COURTSHIP
4738-58078-0022 ONLY SMOOTHING A LITTLE AND SOFTENING DOWN HER REFUSAL BUT WHEN HE CAME AT LENGTH TO THE WORDS PRISCILLA HAD SPOKEN WORDS SO TENDER AND CRUEL WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK FOR YOURSELF JOHN
4738-58078-0023 UP LEAPED THE CAPTAIN OF PLYMOUTH AND STAMPED ON THE FLOOR TILL HIS ARMOR CLANGED ON THE WALL WHERE IT HUNG WITH A SOUND OF SINISTER OMEN ALL HIS PENT UP WRATH BURST FORTH IN A SUDDEN EXPLOSION EVEN AS A HAND GRENADE
4738-58078-0024 THAT SCATTERS DESTRUCTION AROUND IT WILDLY HE SHOUTED AND LOUD
4738-58078-0025 ME MILES STANDISH YOUR FRIEND HAVE SUPPLANTED DEFRAUDED BETRAYED ME ONE OF MY ANCESTORS RAN HIS SWORD THROUGH THE HEART OF WAT TYLER WHO SHALL PREVENT ME FROM RUNNING MY OWN THROUGH THE HEART OF A TRAITOR
4738-58078-0026 YOURS IS THE GREATER TREASON FOR YOURS IS A TREASON TO FRIENDSHIP YOU WHO LIVED UNDER MY ROOF WHOM I CHERISHED AND LOVED AS A BROTHER YOU WHO HAVE FED AT MY BOARD AND DRUNK AT MY CUP TO WHOSE KEEPING I HAVE INTRUSTED MY HONOR
4738-58078-0027 MY THOUGHTS THE MOST SACRED AND SECRET YOU TOO BRUTUS AH WOE TO THE NAME OF FRIENDSHIP HEREAFTER BRUTUS WAS CAESAR'S FRIEND AND YOU WERE MINE BUT HENCEFORWARD
4738-58078-0028 AND IMPLACABLE HATRED SO SPAKE THE CAPTAIN OF PLYMOUTH AND STRODE ABOUT IN THE CHAMBER CHAFING AND CHOKING WITH RAGE LIKE CORDS WERE THE VEINS ON HIS TEMPLES
4738-58078-0029 BUT IN THE MIDST OF HIS ANGER A MAN APPEARED AT THE DOORWAY BRINGING IN UTTERMOST HASTE A MESSAGE OF URGENT IMPORTANCE RUMORS OF DANGER AND WAR AND HOSTILE INCURSIONS OF INDIANS STRAIGHTWAY THE CAPTAIN PAUSED
4738-58078-0030 AND WITHOUT FURTHER QUESTION OR PARLEY TOOK FROM THE NAIL ON THE WALL HIS SWORD WITH ITS SCABBARD OF IRON BUCKLED THE BELT ROUND HIS WAIST AND FROWNING FIERCELY DEPARTED ALDEN WAS LEFT ALONE
4738-58078-0031 HE HEARD THE CLANK OF THE SCABBARD GROWING FAINTER AND FAINTER AND DYING AWAY IN THE DISTANCE THEN HE AROSE FROM HIS SEAT AND LOOKED FORTH INTO THE DARKNESS FELT THE COOL AIR BLOW ON HIS CHEEK
4738-58078-0032 THAT WAS HOT WITH THE INSULT LIFTED HIS EYES TO THE HEAVENS AND FOLDING HIS HANDS AS IN CHILDHOOD PRAYED IN THE SILENCE OF NIGHT TO THE FATHER WHO SEETH IN SECRET
4738-58078-0033 MEANWHILE THE CHOLERIC CAPTAIN STRODE WRATHFUL AWAY TO THE COUNCIL FOUND IT ALREADY ASSEMBLED IMPATIENTLY WAITING HIS COMING MEN IN THE MIDDLE OF LIFE AUSTERE AND GRAVE IN DEPORTMENT ONLY ONE OF THEM OLD
4738-58078-0034 THE HILL THAT WAS NEAREST TO HEAVEN COVERED WITH SNOW BUT ERECT THE EXCELLENT ELDER OF PLYMOUTH GOD HAD SIFTED THREE KINGDOMS TO FIND THE WHEAT FOR THIS PLANTING THEN HAD SIFTED THE WHEAT AS THE LIVING SEED OF A NATION
4738-58078-0035 SO SAY THE CHRONICLES OLD AND SUCH IS THE FAITH OF THE PEOPLE NEAR THEM WAS STANDING AN INDIAN IN ATTITUDE STERN AND DEFIANT NAKED DOWN TO THE WAIST
4738-58078-0036 AND GRIM AND FEROCIOUS IN ASPECT WHILE ON THE TABLE BEFORE THEM WAS LYING UNOPENED A BIBLE PONDEROUS BOUND IN LEATHER BRASS STUDDED PRINTED IN HOLLAND
4738-58078-0037 AND BESIDE IT OUTSTRETCHED THE SKIN OF A RATTLE SNAKE GLITTERED FILLED LIKE A QUIVER WITH ARROWS A SIGNAL AND CHALLENGE OF WARFARE BROUGHT BY THE INDIAN
4738-58078-0038 AND SPEAKING WITH ARROWY TONGUES OF DEFIANCE THIS MILES STANDISH BEHELD AS HE ENTERED AND HEARD THEM DEBATING WHAT WERE AN ANSWER BEFITTING THE HOSTILE MESSAGE AND MENACE TALKING OF THIS AND OF THAT
4738-58078-0039 CONTRIVING SUGGESTING OBJECTING ONE VOICE ONLY FOR PEACE AND THAT THE VOICE OF THE ELDER JUDGING IT WISE AND WELL THAT SOME AT LEAST WERE CONVERTED RATHER THAN ANY WERE SLAIN
4738-58078-0040 FOR THIS WAS BUT CHRISTIAN BEHAVIOR THEN OUT SPAKE MILES STANDISH THE STALWART CAPTAIN OF PLYMOUTH MUTTERING DEEP IN HIS THROAT FOR HIS VOICE WAS HUSKY WITH ANGER
4738-58078-0041 AND THE WATER OF ROSES IS IT TO SHOOT RED SQUIRRELS YOU HAVE YOUR HOWITZER PLANTED THERE ON THE ROOF OF THE CHURCH OR IS IT TO SHOOT RED DEVILS TRULY THE ONLY TONGUE THAT IS UNDERSTOOD BY A SAVAGE
4738-58078-0042 MUST BE THE TONGUE OF FIRE THAT SPEAKS FROM THE MOUTH OF THE CANNON THEREUPON ANSWERED AND SAID THE EXCELLENT ELDER OF PLYMOUTH SOMEWHAT AMAZED AND ALARMED AT THIS IRREVERENT LANGUAGE NOT SO THOUGHT SAINT PAUL
4738-58078-0043 NOR YET THE OTHER APOSTLES NOT FROM THE CANNON'S MOUTH WERE THE TONGUES OF FIRE THEY SPAKE WITH BUT UNHEEDED FELL THIS MILD REBUKE ON THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD ADVANCED TO THE TABLE AND THUS CONTINUED DISCOURSING
4738-58078-0044 LEAVE THIS MATTER TO ME FOR TO ME BY RIGHT IT PERTAINETH WAR IS A TERRIBLE TRADE
