2348-143895-0000 IT WAS FROM HENRIETTA STACKPOLE THAT SHE LEARNED HOW CASPAR GOODWOOD HAD COME TO ROME AN EVENT THAT TOOK PLACE THREE DAYS AFTER LORD WARBURTON'S DEPARTURE THIS LATTER FACT
2348-143895-0001 HAD BEEN PRECEDED BY AN INCIDENT OF SOME IMPORTANCE TO ISABEL THE TEMPORARY ABSENCE ONCE AGAIN OF MADAME MERLE WHO HAD GONE TO NAPLES TO STAY WITH A FRIEND THE HAPPY POSSESSOR OF A VILLA
2348-143895-0002 AT POSILIPPO MADAME MERLE HAD CEASED TO MINISTER TO ISABEL'S HAPPINESS WHO FOUND HERSELF WONDERING WHETHER THE MOST DISCREET OF WOMEN MIGHT NOT ALSO BY CHANCE BE THE MOST DANGEROUS
2348-143895-0003 SOMETIMES AT NIGHT SHE HAD STRANGE VISIONS SHE SEEMED TO SEE HER HUSBAND AND HER FRIEND HIS FRIEND IN DIM INDISTINGUISHABLE COMBINATION IT SEEMED TO HER
2348-143895-0004 THAT SHE HAD NOT DONE WITH HER THIS LADY HAD SOMETHING IN RESERVE ISABEL'S IMAGINATION APPLIED ITSELF ACTIVELY TO THIS ELUSIVE POINT BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN IT WAS CHECKED BY A NAMELESS DREAD
2348-143895-0005 SO THAT WHEN THE CHARMING WOMAN WAS AWAY FROM ROME SHE HAD ALMOST A CONSCIOUSNESS OF RESPITE SHE HAD ALREADY LEARNED FROM MISS STACKPOLE THAT CASPAR GOODWOOD WAS IN EUROPE HENRIETTA HAVING WRITTEN TO MAKE IT KNOWN TO HER
2348-143895-0006 IMMEDIATELY AFTER MEETING HIM IN PARIS HE HIMSELF NEVER WROTE TO ISABEL AND THOUGH HE WAS IN EUROPE SHE THOUGHT IT VERY POSSIBLE HE MIGHT NOT DESIRE TO SEE HER THEIR LAST INTERVIEW BEFORE HER MARRIAGE
2348-143895-0007 HAD HAD QUITE THE CHARACTER OF A COMPLETE RUPTURE IF SHE REMEMBERED RIGHTLY HE HAD SAID HE WISHED TO TAKE HIS LAST LOOK AT HER SINCE THEN HE HAD BEEN THE MOST DISCORDANT SURVIVAL OF HER EARLIER TIME
2348-143895-0008 THE ONLY ONE IN FACT WITH WHICH A PERMANENT PAIN WAS ASSOCIATED HE HAD LEFT HER THAT MORNING WITH A SENSE OF THE MOST SUPERFLUOUS OF SHOCKS IT WAS LIKE A COLLISION BETWEEN VESSELS IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
2348-143895-0009 THERE HAD BEEN NO MIST NO HIDDEN CURRENT TO EXCUSE IT AND SHE HERSELF HAD ONLY WISHED TO STEER WIDE HE HAD BUMPED AGAINST HER PROW HOWEVER WHILE HER HAND WAS ON THE TILLER AND
2348-143895-0010 TO COMPLETE THE METAPHOR HAD GIVEN THE LIGHTER VESSEL A STRAIN WHICH STILL OCCASIONALLY BETRAYED ITSELF IN A FAINT CREAKING IT HAD BEEN HORRID TO SEE HIM
2348-143895-0011 BECAUSE HE REPRESENTED THE ONLY SERIOUS HARM THAT TO HER BELIEF SHE HAD EVER DONE IN THE WORLD HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WITH AN UNSATISFIED CLAIM ON HER SHE HAD MADE HIM UNHAPPY
2348-143895-0012 SHE COULDN'T HELP IT AND HIS UNHAPPINESS WAS A GRIM REALITY SHE HAD CRIED WITH RAGE AFTER HE HAD LEFT HER AT SHE HARDLY KNEW WHAT
2348-143895-0013 SHE TRIED TO THINK IT HAD BEEN AT HIS WANT OF CONSIDERATION HE HAD COME TO HER WITH HIS UNHAPPINESS WHEN HER OWN BLISS WAS SO PERFECT HE HAD DONE HIS BEST TO DARKEN THE BRIGHTNESS OF THOSE PURE RAYS
2348-143895-0014 HE HAD NOT BEEN VIOLENT AND YET THERE HAD BEEN A VIOLENCE IN THE IMPRESSION THERE HAD BEEN A VIOLENCE AT ANY RATE IN SOMETHING SOMEWHERE PERHAPS IT WAS ONLY IN HER OWN FIT OF WEEPING
2348-143895-0015 AND IN THAT AFTER SENSE OF THE SAME WHICH HAD LASTED THREE OR FOUR DAYS THE EFFECT OF HIS FINAL APPEAL HAD IN SHORT FADED AWAY AND ALL THE FIRST YEAR OF HER MARRIAGE HE HAD DROPPED OUT OF HER BOOKS
2348-143895-0016 HE WAS A THANKLESS SUBJECT OF REFERENCE IT WAS DISAGREEABLE TO HAVE TO THINK OF A PERSON WHO WAS SORE AND SOMBRE ABOUT YOU AND WHOM YOU COULD YET DO NOTHING TO RELIEVE
2348-143895-0017 EVEN A LITTLE OF HIS UNRECONCILED STATE AS SHE DOUBTED OF LORD WARBURTON'S UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS BEYOND QUESTION AND THIS AGGRESSIVE UNCOMPROMISING LOOK OF IT WAS JUST WHAT MADE IT UNATTRACTIVE
2348-143895-0018 SHE COULD NEVER SAY TO HERSELF THAT HERE WAS A SUFFERER WHO HAD COMPENSATIONS AS SHE WAS ABLE TO SAY IN THE CASE OF HER ENGLISH SUITOR SHE HAD NO FAITH IN MISTER GOODWOOD'S COMPENSATIONS
2348-143895-0019 AND NO ESTEEM FOR THEM A COTTON FACTORY WAS NOT A COMPENSATION FOR ANYTHING LEAST OF ALL FOR HAVING FAILED TO MARRY ISABEL ARCHER AND YET BEYOND THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW WHAT HE HAD
2348-143895-0020 SAVE OF COURSE HIS INTRINSIC QUALITIES OH HE WAS INTRINSIC ENOUGH SHE NEVER THOUGHT OF HIS EVEN LOOKING FOR ARTIFICIAL AIDS IF HE EXTENDED HIS BUSINESS THAT
2348-143895-0021 BELIEF WAS THE ONLY FORM EXERTION COULD TAKE WITH HIM IT WOULD BE BECAUSE IT WAS AN ENTERPRISING THING
2348-143895-0022 NOT IN THE LEAST BECAUSE HE MIGHT HOPE IT WOULD OVERLAY THE PAST THIS GAVE HIS FIGURE A KIND OF BARENESS AND BLEAKNESS WHICH MADE THE ACCIDENT OF MEETING IT IN MEMORY OR IN APPREHENSION
2348-143895-0023 A PECULIAR CONCUSSION IT WAS DEFICIENT IN THE SOCIAL DRAPERY COMMONLY MUFFLING IN AN OVERCIVILIZED AGE THE SHARPNESS OF HUMAN CONTACTS HIS PERFECT SILENCE MOREOVER
2348-143895-0024 HEARD FROM HIM AND VERY SELDOM HEARD ANY MENTION OF HIM DEEPENED THIS IMPRESSION OF HIS LONELINESS SHE ASKED LILY FOR NEWS OF HIM FROM TIME TO TIME BUT LILY KNEW NOTHING OF BOSTON
2348-143895-0025 HER IMAGINATION WAS ALL BOUNDED ON THE EAST BY MADISON AVENUE AS TIME WENT ON ISABEL HAD THOUGHT OF HIM OFTENER AND WITH FEWER RESTRICTIONS SHE HAD HAD MORE THAN ONCE THE IDEA OF WRITING TO HIM
2348-143895-0026 SHE HAD NEVER TOLD HER HUSBAND ABOUT HIM NEVER LET OSMOND KNOW OF HIS VISITS TO HER IN FLORENCE A RESERVE NOT DICTATED IN THE EARLY PERIOD BY A WANT OF CONFIDENCE IN OSMOND
2348-143895-0027 BUT SIMPLY BY THE CONSIDERATION THAT THE YOUNG MAN'S DISAPPOINTMENT WAS NOT HER SECRET BUT HIS OWN IT WOULD BE WRONG OF HER SHE HAD BELIEVED TO CONVEY IT TO ANOTHER AND MISTER GOODWOOD'S AFFAIRS COULD HAVE AFTER ALL
2348-143895-0028 LITTLE INTEREST FOR GILBERT WHEN IT HAD COME TO THE POINT SHE HAD NEVER WRITTEN TO HIM IT SEEMED TO HER THAT CONSIDERING HIS GRIEVANCE THE LEAST SHE COULD DO
2348-143895-0029 NEVERTHELESS SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO BE IN SOME WAY NEARER TO HIM IT WAS NOT THAT IT EVER OCCURRED TO HER THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE MARRIED HIM EVEN AFTER THE CONSEQUENCES OF HER ACTUAL UNION HAD GROWN VIVID TO HER
2348-143895-0030 THAT PARTICULAR REFLECTION THOUGH SHE INDULGED IN SO MANY HAD NOT HAD THE ASSURANCE TO PRESENT ITSELF BUT ON FINDING HERSELF IN TROUBLE HE HAD BECOME A MEMBER OF THAT CIRCLE OF THINGS
2348-143895-0031 WITH WHICH SHE WISHED TO SET HERSELF RIGHT I HAVE MENTIONED HOW PASSIONATELY SHE NEEDED TO FEEL THAT HER UNHAPPINESS SHOULD NOT HAVE COME TO HER THROUGH HER OWN FAULT SHE HAD NO NEAR PROSPECT OF DYING
2348-143895-0032 AND YET SHE WISHED TO MAKE HER PEACE WITH THE WORLD TO PUT HER SPIRITUAL AFFAIRS IN ORDER IT CAME BACK TO HER FROM TIME TO TIME THAT THERE WAS AN ACCOUNT STILL TO BE SETTLED WITH CASPAR AND SHE SAW HERSELF DISPOSED
2348-143895-0033 OR ABLE TO SETTLE IT TO DAY ON TERMS EASIER FOR HIM THAN EVER BEFORE STILL WHEN SHE LEARNED HE WAS COMING TO ROME SHE FELT ALL AFRAID IT WOULD BE MORE DISAGREEABLE FOR HIM THAN FOR ANY ONE ELSE TO MAKE OUT
2348-143895-0034 SINCE HE WOULD MAKE IT OUT AS OVER A FALSIFIED BALANCE SHEET OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT THE INTIMATE DISARRAY OF HER AFFAIRS DEEP IN HER BREAST
2348-143895-0035 SHE BELIEVED THAT HE HAD INVESTED HIS ALL IN HER HAPPINESS WHILE THE OTHERS HAD INVESTED ONLY A PART HE WAS ONE MORE PERSON FROM WHOM SHE SHOULD HAVE TO CONCEAL HER STRESS SHE WAS REASSURED HOWEVER
2348-143895-0036 AFTER HE ARRIVED IN ROME FOR HE SPENT SEVERAL DAYS WITHOUT COMING TO SEE HER HENRIETTA STACKPOLE IT MAY WELL BE IMAGINED WAS MORE PUNCTUAL AND ISABEL WAS LARGELY FAVOURED WITH THE SOCIETY OF HER FRIEND
2348-143895-0037 SHE THREW HERSELF INTO IT FOR NOW THAT SHE HAD MADE SUCH A POINT OF KEEPING HER CONSCIENCE CLEAR THAT WAS ONE WAY OF PROVING SHE HAD NOT BEEN SUPERFICIAL THE MORE SO AS THE YEARS IN THEIR FLIGHT
2348-143895-0038 HAD RATHER ENRICHED THAN BLIGHTED THOSE PECULIARITIES WHICH HAD BEEN HUMOROUSLY CRITICISED BY PERSONS LESS INTERESTED THAN ISABEL AND WHICH WERE STILL MARKED ENOUGH TO GIVE LOYALTY A SPICE OF HEROISM
2348-143895-0039 HENRIETTA WAS AS KEEN AND QUICK AND FRESH AS EVER AND AS NEAT AND BRIGHT AND FAIR HER REMARKABLY OPEN EYES LIGHTED LIKE GREAT GLAZED RAILWAY STATIONS
2348-143895-0040 HAD PUT UP NO SHUTTERS HER ATTIRE HAD LOST NONE OF ITS CRISPNESS HER OPINIONS NONE OF THEIR NATIONAL REFERENCE SHE WAS BY NO MEANS QUITE UNCHANGED HOWEVER IT STRUCK ISABEL
2348-143895-0041 SHE HAD GROWN VAGUE OF OLD SHE HAD NEVER BEEN VAGUE THOUGH UNDERTAKING MANY ENQUIRIES AT ONCE SHE HAD MANAGED TO BE ENTIRE AND POINTED ABOUT EACH SHE HAD A REASON FOR EVERYTHING SHE DID
2348-143895-0042 SHE FAIRLY BRISTLED WITH MOTIVES FORMERLY WHEN SHE CAME TO EUROPE IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WISHED TO SEE IT BUT NOW HAVING ALREADY SEEN IT SHE HAD NO SUCH EXCUSE
2348-143895-0043 SHE DIDN'T FOR A MOMENT PRETEND THAT THE DESIRE TO EXAMINE DECAYING CIVILISATIONS HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER PRESENT ENTERPRISE HER JOURNEY WAS RATHER AN EXPRESSION OF HER INDEPENDENCE OF THE OLD WORLD
2348-143895-0044 IT'S NOTHING TO COME TO EUROPE SHE SAID TO ISABEL IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME ONE NEEDS SO MANY REASONS FOR THAT IT IS SOMETHING TO STAY AT HOME THIS IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT
2348-143895-0045 IT WAS NOT THEREFORE WITH A SENSE OF DOING ANYTHING VERY IMPORTANT THAT SHE TREATED HERSELF TO ANOTHER PILGRIMAGE TO ROME SHE HAD SEEN THE PLACE BEFORE AND CAREFULLY INSPECTED IT
2348-143895-0046 HER PRESENT ACT WAS SIMPLY A SIGN OF FAMILIARITY OF HER KNOWING ALL ABOUT IT OF HER HAVING AS GOOD A RIGHT AS ANY ONE ELSE TO BE THERE THIS WAS ALL VERY WELL
2348-143895-0047 SHE HAD A PERFECT RIGHT TO BE RESTLESS TOO IF ONE CAME TO THAT BUT SHE HAD AFTER ALL A BETTER REASON FOR COMING TO ROME THAN THAT SHE CARED FOR IT SO LITTLE HER FRIEND EASILY RECOGNISED IT
2348-143895-0048 AND WITH IT THE WORTH OF THE OTHER'S FIDELITY SHE HAD CROSSED THE STORMY OCEAN IN MIDWINTER BECAUSE SHE HAD GUESSED THAT ISABEL WAS SAD HENRIETTA GUESSED A GREAT DEAL
2348-143895-0049 BUT SHE HAD NEVER GUESSED SO HAPPILY AS THAT ISABEL'S SATISFACTIONS JUST NOW WERE FEW BUT EVEN IF THEY HAD BEEN MORE NUMEROUS
2348-143895-0050 IN HAVING ALWAYS THOUGHT HIGHLY OF HENRIETTA SHE HAD MADE LARGE CONCESSIONS WITH REGARD TO HER AND HAD YET INSISTED THAT WITH ALL ABATEMENTS SHE WAS VERY VALUABLE IT WAS NOT HER OWN TRIUMPH HOWEVER
2348-143895-0051 THAT SHE FOUND GOOD IT WAS SIMPLY THE RELIEF OF CONFESSING TO THIS CONFIDANT THE FIRST PERSON TO WHOM SHE HAD OWNED IT THAT SHE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST AT HER EASE HENRIETTA HAD HERSELF APPROACHED THIS POINT
2348-143895-0052 WITH THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE DELAY
2348-143895-0053 SHE WAS A WOMAN SHE WAS A SISTER SHE WAS NOT RALPH NOR LORD WARBURTON NOR CASPAR GOODWOOD AND ISABEL COULD SPEAK YES I'M WRETCHED SHE SAID VERY MILDLY
2348-143895-0054 SHE HATED TO HEAR HERSELF SAY IT SHE TRIED TO SAY IT AS JUDICIALLY AS POSSIBLE WHAT DOES HE DO TO YOU HENRIETTA ASKED FROWNING AS IF SHE WERE ENQUIRING INTO THE OPERATIONS OF A QUACK DOCTOR
2348-143895-0055 HE DOES NOTHING BUT HE DOESN'T LIKE ME HE'S VERY HARD TO PLEASE CRIED MISS STACKPOLE WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE HIM I CAN'T CHANGE THAT WAY ISABEL SAID WHY NOT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
2348-143895-0056 YOU WON'T CONFESS THAT YOU'VE MADE A MISTAKE YOU'RE TOO PROUD I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I'M TOO PROUD BUT I CAN'T PUBLISH MY MISTAKE I DON'T THINK THAT'S DECENT I'D MUCH RATHER DIE
2348-143895-0057 YOU WON'T THINK SO ALWAYS SAID HENRIETTA I DON'T KNOW WHAT GREAT UNHAPPINESS MIGHT BRING ME TO BUT IT SEEMS TO ME I SHALL ALWAYS BE ASHAMED ONE MUST ACCEPT ONE'S DEEDS
2348-143895-0058 I MARRIED HIM BEFORE ALL THE WORLD I WAS PERFECTLY FREE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO ANYTHING MORE DELIBERATE ONE CAN'T CHANGE THAT WAY ISABEL REPEATED YOU HAVE CHANGED IN SPITE OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY
2348-143895-0059 I HOPE YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU LIKE HIM ISABEL DEBATED NO I DON'T LIKE HIM I CAN TELL YOU BECAUSE I'M WEARY OF MY SECRET BUT THAT'S ENOUGH I CAN'T ANNOUNCE IT ON THE HOUSETOPS
2348-143895-0060 HENRIETTA GAVE A LAUGH DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE RATHER TOO CONSIDERATE IT'S NOT OF HIM THAT I'M CONSIDERATE IT'S OF MYSELF ISABEL ANSWERED IT WAS NOT SURPRISING
2348-143895-0061 GILBERT OSMOND SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN COMFORT IN MISS STACKPOLE HIS INSTINCT HAD NATURALLY SET HIM IN OPPOSITION TO A YOUNG LADY CAPABLE OF ADVISING HIS WIFE TO WITHDRAW FROM THE CONJUGAL ROOF WHEN SHE ARRIVED IN ROME
2348-143895-0062 HE HAD SAID TO ISABEL THAT HE HOPED SHE WOULD LEAVE HER FRIEND THE INTERVIEWER ALONE AND ISABEL HAD ANSWERED THAT HE AT LEAST HAD NOTHING TO FEAR FROM HER SHE SAID TO HENRIETTA
2348-143895-0063 THAT AS OSMOND DIDN'T LIKE HER SHE COULDN'T INVITE HER TO DINE BUT THEY COULD EASILY SEE EACH OTHER IN OTHER WAYS ISABEL RECEIVED MISS STACKPOLE FREELY IN HER OWN SITTING ROOM AND TOOK HER REPEATEDLY TO DRIVE FACE TO FACE WITH PANSY WHO
2348-143895-0064 BENDING A LITTLE FORWARD ON THE OPPOSITE SEAT OF THE CARRIAGE GAZED AT THE CELEBRATED AUTHORESS WITH A RESPECTFUL ATTENTION WHICH HENRIETTA OCCASIONALLY FOUND IRRITATING SHE COMPLAINED TO ISABEL THAT MISS OSMOND
2348-143895-0065 I DON'T WANT TO BE REMEMBERED THAT WAY MISS STACKPOLE DECLARED I CONSIDER THAT MY CONVERSATION REFERS ONLY TO THE MOMENT LIKE THE MORNING PAPERS YOUR STEPDAUGHTER AS SHE SITS THERE
2348-143895-0066 LOOKS AS IF SHE KEPT ALL THE BACK NUMBERS AND WOULD BRING THEM OUT SOME DAY AGAINST ME SHE COULD NOT TEACH HERSELF TO THINK FAVOURABLY OF PANSY WHOSE ABSENCE OF INITIATIVE OF CONVERSATION OF PERSONAL CLAIMS SEEMED TO HER
2348-143895-0067 IN A GIRL OF TWENTY UNNATURAL AND EVEN UNCANNY ISABEL PRESENTLY SAW THAT OSMOND WOULD HAVE LIKED HER TO URGE A LITTLE THE CAUSE OF HER FRIEND INSIST A LITTLE UPON HIS RECEIVING HER
2348-143895-0068 SO THAT HE MIGHT APPEAR TO SUFFER FOR GOOD MANNERS SAKE HER IMMEDIATE ACCEPTANCE OF HIS OBJECTIONS PUT HIM TOO MUCH IN THE WRONG IT BEING IN EFFECT ONE OF THE DISADVANTAGES OF EXPRESSING CONTEMPT
2348-143895-0069 THAT YOU CANNOT ENJOY AT THE SAME TIME THE CREDIT OF EXPRESSING SYMPATHY OSMOND HELD TO HIS CREDIT AND YET HE HELD TO HIS OBJECTIONS ALL OF WHICH WERE ELEMENTS DIFFICULT TO RECONCILE THE RIGHT THING
2348-143895-0070 WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT MISS STACKPOLE SHOULD COME TO DINE AT PALAZZO ROCCANERA ONCE OR TWICE SO THAT IN SPITE OF HIS SUPERFICIAL CIVILITY ALWAYS SO GREAT SHE MIGHT JUDGE FOR HERSELF HOW LITTLE PLEASURE IT GAVE HIM
2348-143895-0071 FROM THE MOMENT HOWEVER THAT BOTH THE LADIES WERE SO UNACCOMMODATING THERE WAS NOTHING FOR OSMOND BUT TO WISH THE LADY FROM NEW YORK WOULD TAKE HERSELF OFF IT WAS SURPRISING HOW LITTLE SATISFACTION HE GOT FROM HIS WIFE'S FRIENDS
2348-143895-0072 HE TOOK OCCASION TO CALL ISABEL'S ATTENTION TO IT YOU'RE CERTAINLY NOT FORTUNATE IN YOUR INTIMATES I WISH YOU MIGHT MAKE A NEW COLLECTION HE SAID TO HER ONE MORNING IN REFERENCE TO NOTHING VISIBLE AT THE MOMENT
2348-143895-0073 BUT IN A TONE OF RIPE REFLECTION WHICH DEPRIVED THE REMARK OF ALL BRUTAL ABRUPTNESS IT'S AS IF YOU HAD TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO PICK OUT THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THAT I HAVE LEAST IN COMMON WITH YOUR COUSIN I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT A CONCEITED ASS
2348-143895-0074 BESIDES HIS BEING THE MOST ILL FAVOURED ANIMAL I KNOW THEN IT'S INSUFFERABLY TIRESOME THAT ONE CAN'T TELL HIM SO ONE MUST SPARE HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS HEALTH HIS HEALTH SEEMS TO ME THE BEST PART OF HIM
2348-143895-0075 IT GIVES HIM PRIVILEGES ENJOYED BY NO ONE ELSE IF HE'S SO DESPERATELY ILL THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO PROVE IT BUT HE SEEMS TO HAVE NO MIND FOR THAT I CAN'T SAY MUCH MORE FOR THE GREAT WARBURTON
2348-143895-0076 WHEN ONE REALLY THINKS OF IT THE COOL INSOLENCE OF THAT PERFORMANCE WAS SOMETHING RARE HE COMES AND LOOKS AT ONE'S DAUGHTER AS IF SHE WERE A SUITE OF APARTMENTS
2348-143895-0077 RAPS ON THE WALLS AND ALMOST THINKS HE'LL TAKE THE PLACE WILL YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO DRAW UP A LEASE THEN ON THE WHOLE HE DECIDES THAT THE ROOMS ARE TOO SMALL HE DOESN'T THINK HE COULD LIVE ON A THIRD FLOOR
2348-143895-0078 HE MUST LOOK OUT FOR A PIANO NOBILE AND HE GOES AWAY AFTER HAVING GOT A MONTH'S LODGING IN THE POOR LITTLE APARTMENT FOR NOTHING MISS STACKPOLE HOWEVER IS YOUR MOST WONDERFUL INVENTION SHE STRIKES ME AS A KIND OF MONSTER
2348-143895-0079 ONE HASN'T A NERVE IN ONE'S BODY THAT SHE DOESN'T SET QUIVERING YOU KNOW I NEVER HAVE ADMITTED THAT SHE'S A WOMAN DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE REMINDS ME OF OF A NEW STEEL PEN THE MOST ODIOUS THING IN NATURE
2348-143895-0080 SHE TALKS AS A STEEL PEN WRITES AREN'T HER LETTERS BY THE WAY ON RULED PAPER SHE THINKS AND MOVES AND WALKS AND LOOKS EXACTLY AS SHE TALKS YOU MAY SAY THAT SHE DOESN'T HURT ME
2348-143895-0081 INASMUCH AS I DON'T SEE HER I DON'T SEE HER BUT I HEAR HER I HEAR HER ALL DAY LONG HER VOICE IS IN MY EARS I CAN'T GET RID OF IT I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT SHE SAYS AND EVERY INFLEXION OF THE TONE IN WHICH SHE SAYS IT
2348-143895-0082 SHE SAYS CHARMING THINGS ABOUT ME AND THEY GIVE YOU GREAT COMFORT I DON'T LIKE AT ALL TO THINK SHE TALKS ABOUT ME I FEEL AS I SHOULD FEEL IF I KNEW THE FOOTMAN WERE WEARING MY HAT
2348-143895-0083 HENRIETTA TALKED ABOUT GILBERT OSMOND AS HIS WIFE ASSURED HIM RATHER LESS THAN HE SUSPECTED SHE HAD PLENTY OF OTHER SUBJECTS IN TWO OF WHICH THE READER MAY BE SUPPOSED TO BE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED
2348-143895-0084 SHE LET HER FRIEND KNOW THAT CASPAR GOODWOOD HAD DISCOVERED FOR HIMSELF THAT SHE WAS UNHAPPY THOUGH INDEED HER INGENUITY WAS UNABLE TO SUGGEST WHAT COMFORT HE HOPED TO GIVE HER BY COMING TO ROME AND YET NOT CALLING ON HER
2348-143895-0085 THEY MET HIM TWICE IN THE STREET BUT HE HAD NO APPEARANCE OF SEEING THEM THEY WERE DRIVING AND HE HAD A HABIT OF LOOKING STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM AS IF HE PROPOSED TO TAKE IN BUT ONE OBJECT AT A TIME
2348-143895-0086 ISABEL COULD HAVE FANCIED SHE HAD SEEN HIM THE DAY BEFORE IT MUST HAVE BEEN WITH JUST THAT FACE AND STEP THAT HE HAD WALKED OUT OF MISSUS TOUCHETT'S DOOR AT THE CLOSE OF THEIR LAST INTERVIEW HE WAS DRESSED
2348-143895-0087 JUST AS HE HAD BEEN DRESSED ON THAT DAY
2348-143895-0088 AND YET IN SPITE OF THIS FAMILIAR LOOK THERE WAS A STRANGENESS IN HIS FIGURE TOO SOMETHING THAT MADE HER FEEL IT AFRESH
2348-143895-0089 HE LOOKED BIGGER AND MORE OVERTOPPING THAN OF OLD AND IN THOSE DAYS HE CERTAINLY REACHED HIGH ENOUGH SHE NOTICED THAT THE PEOPLE WHOM HE PASSED LOOKED BACK AFTER HIM BUT HE WENT STRAIGHT FORWARD
2348-143895-0090 LIFTING ABOVE THEM A FACE LIKE A FEBRUARY SKY MISS STACKPOLE'S OTHER TOPIC WAS VERY DIFFERENT SHE GAVE ISABEL THE LATEST NEWS ABOUT MISTER BANTLING HE HAD BEEN OUT IN THE UNITED STATES THE YEAR BEFORE
2348-143895-0091 AND SHE WAS HAPPY TO SAY SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO SHOW HIM CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION
2348-143895-0092 BUT SHE WOULD UNDERTAKE TO SAY IT HAD DONE HIM GOOD HE WASN'T THE SAME MAN WHEN HE LEFT AS HE HAD BEEN WHEN HE CAME IT HAD OPENED HIS EYES AND SHOWN HIM THAT ENGLAND WASN'T EVERYTHING
2348-143895-0093 HE HAD BEEN VERY MUCH LIKED IN MOST PLACES AND THOUGHT EXTREMELY SIMPLE MORE SIMPLE THAN THE ENGLISH WERE COMMONLY SUPPOSED TO BE THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO HAD THOUGHT HIM AFFECTED
2348-143895-0094 SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER THEY MEANT THAT HIS SIMPLICITY WAS AN AFFECTATION SOME OF HIS QUESTIONS WERE TOO DISCOURAGING HE THOUGHT ALL THE CHAMBERMAIDS WERE FARMERS DAUGHTERS OR ALL THE FARMERS DAUGHTERS WERE CHAMBERMAIDS SHE COULDN'T EXACTLY REMEMBER WHICH
2348-143895-0095 HE HADN'T SEEMED ABLE TO GRASP THE GREAT SCHOOL SYSTEM IT HAD BEEN REALLY TOO MUCH FOR HIM ON THE WHOLE HE HAD BEHAVED AS IF THERE WERE TOO MUCH OF EVERYTHING AS IF HE COULD ONLY TAKE IN A SMALL PART
2348-143895-0096 THE PART HE HAD CHOSEN WAS THE HOTEL SYSTEM AND THE RIVER NAVIGATION HE HAD SEEMED REALLY FASCINATED WITH THE HOTELS HE HAD A PHOTOGRAPH OF EVERY ONE HE HAD VISITED BUT THE RIVER STEAMERS WERE HIS PRINCIPAL INTEREST
2348-143895-0097 HE WANTED TO DO NOTHING BUT SAIL ON THE BIG BOATS THEY HAD TRAVELLED TOGETHER FROM NEW YORK TO MILWAUKEE STOPPING AT THE MOST INTERESTING CITIES ON THE ROUTE
