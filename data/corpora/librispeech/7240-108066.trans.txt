7240-108066-0000 THE SYRIAN THE CHURCH HAS AUREOLED AND SAINTED THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE FOUGHT THE COSMIC URGE TO DO NOTHING AND TO BE NOTHING WAS REGARDED AS A VIRTUE
7240-108066-0001 AND NOW AND AGAIN A BEAUTIFUL COLUMN POINTING TO THE SKY ALL ABOUT IS THE DESERT OR SOLITARY PASTURES
7240-108066-0002 AND ONLY THIS WHITE MILESTONE MARKING THE PATH OF THE CENTURIES AND TELLING IN ITS OWN SILENT SOLEMN AND IMPRESSIVE WAY OF A DAY THAT IS DEAD IN THE FIFTH CENTURY A MONK
7240-108066-0003 CALLED SIMEON THE SYRIAN
7240-108066-0004 HE CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A MARBLE COLUMN SIXTY FEET HIGH AND THERE ON THE CAPSTONE HE BEGAN TO LIVE A LIFE BEYOND REPROACH SIMEON WAS THEN TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD
7240-108066-0005 THE ENVIRONMENT WAS CIRCUMSCRIBED BUT THERE WERE OUTLOOK SUNSHINE VENTILATION THREE GOOD THINGS BUT BEYOND THESE THE PLACE HAD CERTAIN DISADVANTAGES
7240-108066-0006 THE CAPSTONE WAS A LITTLE LESS THAN THREE FEET SQUARE SO SIMEON COULD NOT LIE DOWN HE SLEPT SITTING WITH HIS HEAD BOWED BETWEEN HIS KNEES
7240-108066-0007 AND INDEED IN THIS POSTURE HE PASSED MOST OF HIS TIME ANY RECKLESSNESS IN MOVEMENT AND HE WOULD HAVE SLIPPED FROM HIS PERILOUS POSITION AND BEEN DASHED TO DEATH UPON THE STONES BENEATH
7240-108066-0008 AS THE SUN AROSE HE STOOD UP JUST FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND HELD OUT HIS ARMS IN GREETING BLESSING AND IN PRAYER THREE TIMES DURING THE DAY DID HE THUS STRETCH HIS CRAMPED LIMBS
7240-108066-0009 AND PRAY WITH HIS FACE TO THE EAST AT SUCH TIMES THOSE WHO STOOD NEAR SHARED IN HIS PRAYERS AND WENT AWAY BLESSED AND REFRESHED HOW DID SIMEON GET TO THE TOP OF THE COLUMN
7240-108066-0010 WELL HIS COMPANIONS AT THE MONASTERY A MILE AWAY SAID HE WAS CARRIED THERE IN THE NIGHT BY A MIRACULOUS POWER THAT HE WENT TO SLEEP IN HIS STONE CELL AND AWOKE ON THE PILLAR
7240-108066-0011 OTHER MONKS SAID THAT SIMEON HAD GONE TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO A FAIR LADY AND IN WRATH GOD HAD CAUGHT HIM AND PLACED HIM ON HIGH
7240-108066-0012 AS VIEWED BY AN UNBELIEVER THAT HE SHOT A LINE OVER THE COLUMN WITH A BOW AND ARROW AND THEN DREW UP A ROPE LADDER AND ASCENDED WITH EASE
7240-108066-0013 WITH THE SCORCHING HEAT OF THE MIDDAY SUN AND THE COOL WINDS OF THE NIGHT STILL SIMEON KEPT HIS PLACE THE RAINY SEASON CAME ON WHEN THE NIGHTS WERE COLD AND DARK
7240-108066-0014 SIMEON SAT THERE WITH BOWED HEAD AND DREW THE FOLDS OF HIS SINGLE GARMENT A BLACK ROBE OVER HIS FACE ANOTHER SEASON PASSED THE SUN AGAIN GREW WARM THEN HOT
7240-108066-0015 AND THE SANDSTORMS RAGED AND BLEW WHEN THE PEOPLE BELOW ALMOST LOST SIGHT OF THE MAN ON THE COLUMN SOME PROPHESIED HE WOULD BE BLOWN OFF BUT THE MORNING LIGHT REVEALED HIS FORM
7240-108066-0016 NAKED FROM THE WAIST UP STANDING WITH HANDS OUTSTRETCHED TO GREET THE RISING SUN ONCE EACH DAY AS DARKNESS GATHERED A MONK CAME WITH A BASKET CONTAINING A BOTTLE OF GOAT'S MILK
7240-108066-0017 THERE WAS NO RESPITE NOR REST FROM THE HARD SURFACE OF THE ROCK AND ACHING MUSCLES COULD FIND NO CHANGE FROM THE CRAMPED AND PERILOUS POSITION IF HE FELL IT WAS DAMNATION FOR HIS SOUL
7240-108066-0018 ALL WERE AGREED AS TO THIS BUT MAN'S BODY AND MIND ACCOMMODATE THEMSELVES TO ALMOST ANY CONDITION ONE THING AT LEAST SIMEON WAS FREE FROM ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITIES
7240-108066-0019 FREE FROM SOCIAL CARES AND INTRUSION BORES WITH SAD STORIES OF UNAPPRECIATED LIVES AND FOND HOPES UNREALIZED NEVER BROKE IN UPON HIS PEACE
7240-108066-0020 NEVER IRRITATED HIS TEMPER HIS CORRESPONDENCE NEVER GOT IN A HEAP SIMEON KEPT NO TRACK OF THE DAYS HAVING NO ENGAGEMENTS TO MEET NOR OFFICES TO PERFORM
7240-108066-0021 BECAME A HABIT LANGUAGE WAS LOST IN DISUSE THE FOOD HE ATE WAS MINIMUM IN QUANTITY SENSATION CEASED AND THE DRY HOT WINDS
7240-108066-0022 REDUCED BODILY TISSUE TO A DESSICATED SOMETHING CALLED A SAINT LOVED FEARED AND REVERENCED FOR HIS FORTITUDE THIS PILLAR WHICH HAD ONCE GRACED THE PORTAL OF A PAGAN TEMPLE
7240-108066-0023 AGAIN BECAME A PLACE OF PIOUS PILGRIMAGE AND PEOPLE FLOCKED TO SIMEON'S ROCK SO THAT THEY MIGHT BE NEAR WHEN HE STRETCHED OUT HIS BLACK BONY HANDS TO THE EAST AND THE SPIRIT OF ALMIGHTY GOD
7240-108066-0024 FOR A SPACE HOVERED CLOSE AROUND SO MUCH ATTENTION DID THE ABNEGATION OF SIMEON ATTRACT THAT VARIOUS OTHER PILLARS MARKING THE RUINS OF ART AND GREATNESS GONE
7240-108066-0025 THE BISHOPS IN ASSEMBLY ASKED IS SIMEON SINCERE TO TEST THE MATTER OF SIMEON'S PRIDE HE WAS ORDERED TO COME DOWN FROM HIS RETREAT AS TO HIS CHASTITY THERE WAS LITTLE DOUBT
7240-108066-0026 HIS POVERTY WAS BEYOND QUESTION BUT HOW ABOUT OBEDIENCE TO HIS SUPERIORS THE ORDER WAS SHOUTED UP TO HIM IN A BISHOP'S VOICE HE MUST LET DOWN HIS ROPE DRAW UP A LADDER
7240-108066-0027 AND DESCEND STRAIGHTWAY SIMEON MADE PREPARATION TO OBEY AND THEN THE BISHOPS RELENTED AND CRIED WE HAVE CHANGED OUR MINDS AND NOW ORDER YOU TO REMAIN
7240-108066-0028 SIMEON LIFTED HIS HANDS IN ADORATION AND THANKFULNESS AND RENEWED HIS LEASE AND SO HE LIVED ON AND ON AND ON HE LIVED ON THE TOP OF THAT PILLAR NEVER ONCE DESCENDING
7240-108066-0029 FOR THIRTY YEARS ALL HIS FORMER COMPANIONS GREW AWEARY AND ONE BY ONE DIED AND THE MONASTERY BELLS TOLLED THEIR REQUIEM AS THEY WERE LAID TO REST
7240-108066-0030 THE YOUNG MONK WHO NOW AT EVENTIDE BROUGHT THE BASKET WITH THE BOTTLE OF GOAT'S MILK AND THE LOAF OF BROWN BREAD WAS BORN SINCE SIMEON HAD TAKEN HIS PLACE ON THE PILLAR
7240-108066-0031 HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE THE PEOPLE SAID AND CROSSED THEMSELVES HURRIEDLY BUT ONE EVENING WHEN THE YOUNG MONK CAME WITH HIS BASKET NO LINE WAS DROPPED DOWN FROM ABOVE
7240-108066-0032 HE WAITED AND THEN CALLED ALOUD BUT ALL IN VAIN WHEN SUNRISE CAME THERE SAT THE MONK HIS FACE BETWEEN HIS KNEES THE FOLDS OF HIS BLACK ROBE DRAWN OVER HIS HEAD
7240-108066-0033 BUT HE DID NOT RISE AND LIFT HIS HANDS IN PRAYER ALL DAY HE SAT THERE MOTIONLESS THE PEOPLE WATCHED IN WHISPERED SILENCE WOULD HE ARISE AT SUNDOWN AND PRAY
7240-108066-0034 AND WITH OUTSTRETCHED HANDS BLESS THE ASSEMBLED PILGRIMS AND AS THEY WATCHED A VULTURE CAME SAILING SLOWLY THROUGH THE BLUE ETHER AND CIRCLED NEARER AND NEARER
7240-108066-0035 AND OFF ON THE HORIZON WAS ANOTHER AND STILL ANOTHER
