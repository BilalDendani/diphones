8587-295524-0000 THE DELAWARES IMMEDIATELY SET OUT TO FIND THE DISTANT LAKE AND LEARN THE IDENTITY OF THE PEOPLE WHOM SPOTTED DEER HAD SEEN THEY FOLLOWED THE ROUTE WHICH RUNNING FOX HAD TAKEN SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE
8587-295524-0001 THEY JUDGED THAT THE WATER WAS ABOUT TWO DAYS JOURNEY AWAY DOES THAT LOOK LIKE THE WATER YOU SAW RUNNING FOX ASKED SPOTTED DEER YES IT IS THE SAME REPLIED SPOTTED DEER
8587-295524-0002 THEN HE TURNED TOWARD THE WEST AND POINTED OUT THE ROUTE WHICH THE UNKNOWN WAR PARTY HAD FOLLOWED WELL IF THEY DID NOT TURN OFF SOME OTHER WAY THEY MUST BE AT THE WATER BY NOW DECLARED RUNNING FOX
8587-295524-0003 YES THAT IS HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT AGREED SPOTTED DEER
8587-295524-0004 LATER IN THE DAY AS THEY WERE MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH A DENSE SWAMP THEY HEARD A HARSH CRY OVER THEIR HEADS LOOKING UP THEY SAW A LARGE BALD EAGLE CIRCLING SLOWLY ABOVE THE TREE TOPS RUNNING FOX IMMEDIATELY BECAME EXCITED
8587-295524-0005 THAT MEANS A FIGHT YES I SAW HIM FLYING AROUND LIKE THAT BEFORE I HAD THE BATTLE WITH THE BEAR DO YOU HEAR HIM CALLING WELL THAT IS THE WAR CRY OF HIS PEOPLE SPOTTED DEER I BELIEVE WE ARE GOING INTO SOME KIND OF DANGER WELL
8587-295524-0006 I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THOSE THINGS BUT I BELIEVE THAT WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE SAID SPOTTED DEER
8587-295524-0007 WE MUST KEEP TOGETHER AND WATCH SHARP HE WARNED SPOTTED DEER
8587-295524-0008 THE LADS WONDERED WHETHER THEY WERE ENCAMPED SOMEWHERE ALONG THE SHORE OF THE LAKE
8587-295524-0009 THEY STOPPED ON THE TOP OF A LOW RIDGE SOME DISTANCE BACK FROM THE WATER WE WILL WAIT HERE UNTIL IT GETS DARK SAID RUNNING FOX THEN WE WILL CRAWL DOWN THERE AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND OUT ANYTHING
8587-295524-0010 THEY WONDERED WHERE THE MOHAWK CAMP WAS LOCATED THEY BELIEVED IT WAS SOMEWHERE TOWARD THE NORTH STILL THEY SAW NO EVIDENCE OF IT THEY SEARCHED THE SKY UNTIL DARK
8587-295524-0011 THEN AS NIGHT FINALLY SHUT DOWN
8587-295524-0012 THE DELAWARES STOLE DOWN THROUGH THE SILENT BLACK WOODS AS SOFTLY AND AS CAUTIOUSLY AS WOAKUS THE FOX
8587-295524-0013 FOR THEY KNEW THAT IF THE MOHAWKS WERE ACTUALLY ON THE WAR TRAIL THEY WOULD NOT DARE TO EXPOSE THEMSELVES IN THAT MANNER EVEN IN THE HEART OF THEIR OWN STRONGHOLD THEREFORE WHEN THE LADS FOUND NOTHING TO ALARM THEM THEY ADVANCED CAREFULLY ALONG THE SHORE OF THE LAKE
8587-295524-0014 IT MUST BE THAT THOSE WARRIORS HAVE STOPPED THERE SAID SPOTTED DEER IT IS MYSTERIOUS REPLIED RUNNING FOX IF THOSE PEOPLE ARE ON THE WAR TRAIL WHY DO THEY MAKE A FIRE THE LADS WERE UNABLE TO EXPLAIN IT THEY HAD SEEN THE MOHAWKS PAINTED FOR WAR
8587-295524-0015 AND UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT SEEMED INCREDIBLE THAT THEY WOULD DARE TO MAKE A FIRE IT APPEARED AS IF IT MUST HAVE BEEN LIGHTED BY SOME ONE ELSE STILL THAT TOO SEEMED BEYOND BELIEF
8587-295524-0016 THE DELAWARES REALIZED THAT EVEN A LARGE WAR PARTY OF ENEMIES WOULD SCARCELY BE SO BOLD IN THE DOMAINS OF THEIR FOES
8587-295524-0017 YES THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED RUNNING FOX
8587-295524-0018 WHAT IS IT INQUIRED SPOTTED DEER WELL THESE PEOPLE MAY HE ONEIDAS OR ONONDAGAS SAID RUNNING FOX
8587-295524-0019 PERHAPS THEY DO NOT KNOW THAT THE MOHAWKS ARE ON THE WAR TRAIL
8587-295524-0020 WELL IF THIS WATER IS NEAR THE MOHAWK VILLAGE WHY DID THESE PEOPLE STOP HERE IF THEY ARE THE SAME PEOPLE YOU SAW THEN THEY MUST HAVE ARRIVED HERE BEFORE THE LAST SUN APPEARED WHY DID THEY WAIT HERE
8587-295524-0021 WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE REPLIED SPOTTED DEER BUT I WILL TELL YOU HOW IT MIGHT BE I DO NOT BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE ARE MOHAWKS I BELIEVE I WAS WRONG ABOUT THAT
8587-295524-0022 WELL PERHAPS THEY HAVE MADE A LONG JOURNEY PERHAPS THEY WANT TO REST PERHAPS THE MOHAWKS DO NOT KNOW THEY ARE HERE THEN THEY MUST WAIT
8587-295524-0023 THEN THE MOHAWKS WILL GET READY A BIG FEAST IT IS THE PROPER WAY TO DO
8587-295524-0024 WELL I SEE THAT IT MAY BE AS YOU SAY SAID RUNNING FOX BUT WE WILL NOT FIND OUT ABOUT IT BY SITTING HERE AND TALKING WE SEE A FIRE WELL WE MUST CREEP UP CLOSE AND FIND OUT WHO MADE IT I AM READY DECLARED SPOTTED DEER
8587-295524-0025 THEY ROSE AND BEGAN A DARING ADVANCE ALONG THE EDGE OF THE LAKE THEY MOVED WITH GREAT CAUTION
8587-295524-0026 HOWEVER THE FIRE WAS A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE AHEAD OF THEM AND THEY BELIEVED THAT THEY WOULD BE COMPARATIVELY SAFE UNTIL THEY GOT WITHIN BOW SHOT OF IT THEN THEY WERE STARTLED BY A LOUD SPLASH IN THE RIVER
8587-295524-0027 WHAT WAS THAT SPOTTED DEER WHISPERED ANXIOUSLY SH CAUTIONED RUNNING FOX THEY LISTENED MANY MOMENTS BUT THE SILENCE WAS UNBROKEN
8587-295524-0028 PERHAPS IT WAS MASCHILAMEK THE TROUT THEN AS THEY HEARD NOTHING MORE THEY CONTINUED TOWARD THE FIRE
8587-295524-0029 THEY KNEW THAT THE WIND WAS IN THEIR FAVOR IT GAVE THEM CONFIDENCE FOR THEY REALIZED THAT THERE WAS LESS LIKELIHOOD OF BEING HEARD
8587-295524-0030 SPOTTED DEER STOPPED IT IS ONLY SASAPPIS THE FIRE FLY WHISPERED RUNNING FOX
8587-295524-0031 WE MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO HARM HIM A SHORT DISTANCE FARTHER ON THEY WERE HALTED BY THE DEEP RINGING NOTES OF THE BIG HORNED OWL
8587-295524-0032 IT WAS REPEATED THREE TIMES IN RAPID SUCCESSION AND THE DELAWARES IMMEDIATELY BECAME SUSPICIOUS A FEW MOMENTS AFTERWARD THEY HEARD ANOTHER OWL CALLING DIRECTLY BEHIND THEM
8587-295524-0033 WE HAVE RUN INTO A TRAP RUNNING FOX WHISPERED SAVAGELY COME WE MUST GET TO THE WATER IT IS THE ONLY CHANCE THEY WERE CLOSE UPON THE RIVER
8587-295524-0034 AND THAT THEY MUST FIGHT AGAINST HEAVY ODDS TO SAVE THEMSELVES THEY SAW NOW THAT THE FIRE WAS A CLEVER RUSE OF THEIR ENEMIES TO DRAW THEIR FOES INTO AN AMBUSH THE LADS HAD LITTLE DOUBT THAT THEY WERE AGAIN FACE TO FACE WITH THE HATED MOHAWKS
8587-295524-0035 IT IS DARK AND THEY MAY GO BY US
8587-295524-0036 NO THAT WOULD BE FOOLISH REPLIED RUNNING FOX
8587-295524-0037 IF WE CLIMB INTO A TREE THEY WILL KNOW WHERE WE HAVE GONE THEN THEY WILL WAIT UNTIL IT GETS LIGHT AND KILL US LIKE WISAWANIK THE SQUIRREL THE NEXT MOMENT A PIERCING YELL RANG THROUGH THE NIGHT
8587-295524-0038 THEN RUNNING FOX RECOVERED HIS WITS AND TOOK COMMAND COME WE MUST FIGHT OUR WAY TO THE WATER HE CRIED FITTING ARROWS TO THEIR BOWS THEY HURRIED TOWARD THE RIVER THEY HAD NOT COVERED HALF OF THE DISTANCE WHEN TWO STALWART FIGURES ROSE OUT OF THE DARKNESS TO OPPOSE THEM
8587-295524-0039 AN ARROW SPED CLOSE TO RUNNING FOX AND THE NEXT INSTANT HIS OWN ARROW DROPPED HIS ENEMY TO THE GROUND TURNING TO CALL SPOTTED DEER HE HEARD HIM THRASHING ABOUT IN THE UNDERGROWTH
8587-295524-0040 HE FELT SURE THAT HE WAS NOT A MOHAWK BUT HE WAS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY HIM RUNNING FOX NOTED HOWEVER THAT THE WARRIOR'S FACE WAS STREAKED WITH CHARCOAL IN TOKEN OF WAR THEN THE LADS HEARD THEIR FOES CLOSING IN UPON THEM AND THEY REALIZED THAT THEY MUST BE OFF
8587-295524-0041 AS THEY SPED TOWARD THE RIVER THEY HEARD SOME ONE BEHIND THEM SHOUTING
8587-295524-0042 NOW I KNOW WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE CRIED RUNNING FOX THAT PERSON BEHIND US IS SHOUTING THE SHAWNEE NAME FOR THE MOHAWKS YES THIS IS A SHAWNEE WAR PARTY THEY TAKE US FOR MOHAWKS IT IS GOOD
8587-295524-0043 THEN AS AN ARROW HUMMED OMINOUSLY ABOVE THEIR HEADS THE LADS PLUNGED FORWARD AND SWAM FURIOUSLY TO ESCAPE FROM BOW SHOT
8587-295524-0044 AND AS SOON AS THEY REACHED DEEPER WATER THE DELAWARES DOVE FROM SIGHT
8587-295524-0045 AND THEN THEY TURNED AND SWAM TOWARD THE OPPOSITE SHORE THEY PASSED THROUGH THE WATER AS SILENTLY AS WININGUS THE MINK FOR THEY KNEW THAT SHARP EARED FOES WERE LISTENING TO CATCH THE FAINTEST SOUND
8587-295524-0046 IT DROVE THEM TO GREATER EFFORTS AND THEY RACED THROUGH THE WATER AT TOP SPEED
8587-295524-0047 THEY MOVED MORE CAUTIOUSLY THEY BELIEVED THAT HAVING LOST SIGHT OF THEM IN THE DARKNESS THEIR CRAFTY FOES WERE LISTENING TO HEAR THEM LEAVE THE WATER
8587-295524-0048 WE WILL SWIM AHEAD UNTIL WE ARE A LONG WAYS ABOVE THIS PLACE PROPOSED SPOTTED DEER
8587-295524-0049 IF THE SHAWNEES REACH LAND THEY WILL TRAVEL FASTER THAN WE CAN MOVE THROUGH THE WATER
8587-295524-0050 WE WILL SWIM AHEAD A LITTLE WAYS AND THEN WE WILL WALK OUT THEY SWAM SOME DISTANCE FARTHER AND THEN WADED ASHORE
8587-295524-0051 THE FIRE WAS STILL BURNING BRIGHTLY ON THE OPPOSITE SHORE
