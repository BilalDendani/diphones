1668-136280-0000 SO THAT OUT OF DOORS AND AT TABLE WE CHILDREN WOULD SAY TO OURSELVES IN ASTONISHMENT IS THIS OUR SCHOOLMASTER BUT WHEN IN SCHOOL WE WOULD ASK IS THIS MISTER TRIGG
1668-136280-0001 BUT AS I HAVE RELATED HE HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN TO INFLICT CORPORAL PUNISHMENT ON US AND WAS FINALLY GOT RID OF BECAUSE IN ONE OF HIS DEMONIACAL MOODS HE THRASHED US BRUTALLY WITH HIS HORSEWHIP
1668-136280-0002 SOME RESTRAINT SOME TEACHING WAS STILL IMPOSED UPON US BY OUR MOTHER WHO TOOK OR RATHER TRIED TO TAKE THIS ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON HERSELF ACCORDINGLY WE HAD TO MEET WITH OUR LESSON BOOKS AND SPEND THREE OR FOUR HOURS EVERY MORNING WITH HER
1668-136280-0003 OR IN THE SCHOOLROOM WITHOUT HER FOR SHE WAS CONSTANTLY BEING CALLED AWAY AND WHEN PRESENT A PORTION OF THE TIME WAS SPENT IN A LITTLE TALK WHICH WAS NOT CONCERNED WITH OUR LESSONS FOR WE MOVED AND BREATHED AND HAD OUR BEING IN A STRANGE MORAL ATMOSPHERE
1668-136280-0004 WHERE LAWLESS ACTS WERE COMMON AND EVIL AND GOOD WERE SCARCELY DISTINGUISHABLE AND ALL THIS MADE HER MORE ANXIOUS ABOUT OUR SPIRITUAL THAN OUR MENTAL NEEDS
1668-136280-0005 MY TWO ELDER BROTHERS DID NOT ATTEND AS THEY HAD LONG DISCOVERED THAT THEIR ONLY SAFE PLAN WAS TO BE THEIR OWN SCHOOLMASTERS AND IT WAS EVEN MORE THAN SHE COULD MANAGE VERY WELL TO KEEP THE FOUR SMALLER ONES TO THEIR TASKS
1668-136280-0006 SHE SYMPATHIZED TOO MUCH WITH OUR IMPATIENCE AT CONFINEMENT WHEN SUN AND WIND AND THE CRIES OF WILD BIRDS CALLED INSISTENTLY TO US TO COME OUT AND BE ALIVE AND ENJOY OURSELVES IN OUR OWN WAY
1668-136280-0007 THIS PRIEST WHO IN HIS WANDERINGS ABOUT THE WORLD HAD DRIFTED HITHER AND WAS ANXIOUS TO FIND SOME PLACE TO STAY AT OUT ON THE PLAINS WHILE WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO TURN UP AS HE WAS WITHOUT MEANS HE SAID HE WOULD BE GLAD OF THE POSITION OF SCHOOLMASTER IN THE HOUSE FOR A TIME THAT IT WOULD EXACTLY SUIT HIM
1668-136280-0008 FATHER O'KEEFE WHO NOW APPEARED ON THE SCENE WAS VERY UNLIKE MISTER TRIGG HE WAS A VERY BIG MAN IN BLACK BUT RUSTY CLERICAL GARMENTS HE ALSO HAD AN EXTRAORDINARILY BIG HEAD AND FACE ALL OF A DULL REDDISH COLOUR
1668-136280-0009 USUALLY COVERED WITH A THREE OR FOUR DAYS GROWTH OF GRIZZLY HAIR ALTHOUGH HIS LARGE FACE WAS UNMISTAKABLY INTENSELY IRISH IT WAS NOT THE GORILLA LIKE COUNTENANCE SO COMMON IN THE IRISH PEASANT PRIEST THE PRIEST ONE SEES EVERY DAY IN THE STREETS OF DUBLIN
1668-136280-0010 HE WAS PERHAPS OF A BETTER CLASS AS HIS FEATURES WERE ALL GOOD A HEAVY MAN AS WELL AS A BIG ONE HE WAS NOT SO AMUSING AND SO FLUENT A TALKER OUT OF SCHOOL AS HIS PREDECESSOR NOR AS WE WERE DELIGHTED TO DISCOVER SO EXACTING AND TYRANNICAL IN SCHOOL
1668-136280-0011 ON THE CONTRARY IN AND OUT OF SCHOOL HE WAS ALWAYS THE SAME MILD AND PLACID IN TEMPER WITH A GENTLE SORT OF HUMOUR AND HE WAS ALSO VERY ABSENT MINDED
1668-136280-0012 HE WOULD FORGET ALL ABOUT SCHOOL HOURS ROAM ABOUT THE GARDENS AND PLANTATIONS GET INTO LONG CONVERSATIONS WITH THE WORKMEN AND EVENTUALLY WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE WAS SOMEWHAT TOO CASUAL TO PLEASE HIS EMPLOYER HE ENJOINED US TO LOOK HIM UP AND LET HIM KNOW WHEN IT WAS SCHOOL TIME
1668-136280-0013 LOOKING HIM UP USUALLY TOOK A GOOD DEAL OF TIME HIS TEACHING WAS NOT VERY EFFECTIVE
1668-136280-0014 WHEN LESSONS WERE NOT LEARNED HE WOULD SYMPATHIZE WITH AND COMFORT US BY SAYING WE HAD DONE OUR BEST AND MORE COULD NOT BE EXPECTED HE WAS ALSO GLAD OF ANY EXCUSE TO LET US OFF FOR HALF A DAY
1668-136280-0015 WE FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY FOND OF FISHING THAT WITH A ROD AND LINE IN HIS HAND HE WOULD SPEND HOURS OF PERFECT HAPPINESS EVEN WITHOUT A BITE TO CHEER HIM AND ON ANY FINE DAY THAT CALLED US TO THE PLAIN WE WOULD TELL HIM THAT IT WAS A PERFECT DAY FOR FISHING AND ASK HIM TO LET US OFF FOR THE AFTERNOON
1668-136280-0016 AT DINNER TIME HE WOULD BROACH THE SUBJECT AND SAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN VERY HARD AT THEIR STUDIES ALL THE MORNING AND THAT IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO FORCE THEIR YOUNG MINDS TOO MUCH THAT ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES JACK A DULL BOY
1668-136280-0017 AND SO ON AND SO FORTH AND THAT HE CONSIDERED IT WOULD BE BEST FOR THEM INSTEAD OF GOING BACK TO MORE LESSONS IN THE AFTERNOON TO GO FOR A RIDE HE ALWAYS GAINED HIS POINT AND DINNER OVER WE WOULD RUSH OUT TO CATCH AND SADDLE OUR HORSES AND ONE FOR FATHER O'KEEFE
1668-136280-0018 THE YOUNGER OF OUR TWO ELDER BROTHERS THE SPORTSMAN AND FIGHTER AND OUR LEADER AND MASTER IN ALL OUR OUTDOOR PASTIMES AND PEREGRINATIONS HAD TAKEN TO THE STUDY OF MATHEMATICS WITH TREMENDOUS ENTHUSIASM
1668-136280-0019 THE SAME TEMPER WHICH HE DISPLAYED IN EVERY SUBJECT AND EXERCISE THAT ENGAGED HIM FENCING BOXING SHOOTING HUNTING AND SO ON AND ON FATHER O'KEEFE'S ENGAGEMENT HE WAS ANXIOUS TO KNOW IF THE NEW MASTER WOULD BE ANY USE TO HIM THE PRIEST HAD SENT A MOST SATISFACTORY REPLY
1668-136280-0020 IT WAS ACCORDINGLY ARRANGED THAT MY BROTHER WAS TO HAVE AN EARLY HOUR EACH MORNING WITH THE MASTER BEFORE SCHOOL HOURS AND AN HOUR OR TWO IN THE EVENING VERY SOON IT BEGAN TO APPEAR THAT THE STUDIES WERE NOT PROGRESSING SMOOTHLY
1668-136280-0021 THE PRIEST WOULD COME FORTH AS USUAL WITH A SMILING PLACID COUNTENANCE MY BROTHER WITH A BLACK SCOWL ON HIS FACE
1668-136280-0022 THEN BEGINNING TO SEE IT IN A HUMOROUS LIGHT HE WOULD SHOUT WITH LAUGHTER AT THE PRIEST'S PRETENTIONS TO KNOW ANYTHING AND WOULD SAY HE WAS ONLY FIT TO TEACH BABIES JUST OUT OF THE CRADLE TO SAY THEIR A B C
1668-136280-0023 HE ONLY WISHED THE PRIEST HAD ALSO PRETENDED TO SOME ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE MANLY ART SO THAT THEY COULD HAVE A FEW BOUTS WITH THE GLOVES ON AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT PLEASURE TO BRUISE THAT BIG HUMBUGGING FACE BLACK AND BLUE
1668-136280-0024 THE MATHEMATICAL LESSONS SOON CEASED ALTOGETHER BUT WHENEVER AN AFTERNOON OUTING WAS ARRANGED MY BROTHER WOULD THROW ASIDE HIS BOOKS TO JOIN US AND TAKE THE LEAD
1668-136280-0025 THE RIDE TO THE RIVER HE WOULD SAY WOULD GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A LITTLE CAVALRY TRAINING AND LANCE THROWING EXERCISE IN THE CANE BRAKE HE WOULD CUT LONG STRAIGHT CANES FOR LANCES WHICH AT THE FISHING GROUND WOULD BE CUT DOWN TO A PROPER LENGTH FOR RODS THEN
1668-136280-0026 MOUNTING WE WOULD SET OFF O'KEEFE AHEAD ABSORBED AS USUAL IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS WHILE WE AT A DISTANCE OF A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO WOULD FORM IN LINE AND GO THROUGH OUR EVOLUTIONS CHASING THE FLYING ENEMY O'KEEFE
1668-136280-0027 AND AT INTERVALS OUR COMMANDER WOULD GIVE THE ORDER TO CHARGE WHEREUPON WE WOULD DASH FORWARD WITH A SHOUT AND WHEN ABOUT FORTY YARDS FROM HIM WE WOULD ALL HURL OUR LANCES SO AS TO MAKE THEM FALL JUST AT THE FEET OF HIS HORSE
1668-136280-0028 BUT NEVER ONCE WOULD HE TURN HIS HEAD OR HAVE ANY INKLING OF OUR CARRYINGS ON IN THE REAR EVEN WHEN HIS HORSE LASHED OUT VICIOUSLY WITH HIS HIND LEGS AT THE LANCES WHEN THEY FELL TOO NEAR HIS FEET WE ENJOYED THE ADVANTAGE OF THE O'KEEFE REGIME FOR ABOUT A YEAR
1668-136280-0029 THEN ONE DAY IN HIS USUAL CASUAL MANNER WITHOUT A HINT AS TO HOW HIS PRIVATE AFFAIRS WERE GOING HE SAID THAT HE HAD TO GO SOMEWHERE TO SEE SOME ONE ABOUT SOMETHING AND WE SAW HIM NO MORE
1668-136280-0030 HOWEVER NEWS OF HIS MOVEMENTS AND A GOOD DEAL OF INFORMATION ABOUT HIM REACHED US INCIDENTALLY FROM ALL WHICH IT APPEARED THAT DURING HIS TIME WITH US AND FOR SOME MONTHS PREVIOUSLY FATHER O'KEEFE HAD BEEN WORKING OUT HIS OWN SALVATION IN A QUIET WAY IN ACCORDANCE WITH A RATHER ELABORATE PLAN WHICH HE HAD DEVISED
1668-136280-0031 AND AT LENGTH TIRED OF WAITING IN VAIN HE HAD QUIETLY WITHDRAWN HIMSELF FROM THIS SOCIETY AND HAD GOT INTO COMMUNICATION WITH ONE OF THE PROTESTANT CLERGYMEN OF THE TOWN
1668-136280-0032 HE INTIMATED OR INSINUATED THAT HE HAD LONG BEEN TROUBLED WITH CERTAIN SCRUPLES THAT HIS CONSCIENCE DEMANDED A LITTLE MORE LIBERTY THAN HIS CHURCH WOULD ALLOW ITS FOLLOWERS
1668-136280-0033 AND THIS HAD CAUSED HIM TO CAST A WISTFUL EYE ON THAT OTHER CHURCH WHOSE FOLLOWERS WERE ALAS ACCORDED A LITTLE MORE LIBERTY THAN WAS PERHAPS GOOD FOR THEIR SOULS BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW AND IN ANY CASE HE WOULD LIKE TO CORRESPOND ON THESE IMPORTANT MATTERS WITH ONE ON THE OTHER SIDE
1668-136280-0034 THIS LETTER MET WITH A WARM RESPONSE AND THERE WAS MUCH CORRESPONDENCE AND MEETINGS WITH OTHER CLERICS ANGLICAN OR EPISCOPALIAN I FORGET WHICH BUT THERE WERE ALSO PRESBYTERIANS LUTHERANS AND METHODIST MINISTERS ALL WITH CHURCHES OF THEIR OWN IN THE TOWN AND HE MAY HAVE FLIRTED A LITTLE WITH ALL OF THEM
1668-136280-0035 BUT THE AUTHORITIES OF THE CHURCH HAD NOT GOT RID OF HIM THEY HEARD NOT INFREQUENTLY FROM HIM AND IT WAS NOT PLEASANT HEARING HE HAD COME HE TOLD THEM A ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIEST TO A ROMAN CATHOLIC COUNTRY AND HAD FOUND HIMSELF A STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND
1668-136280-0036 HE HAD WAITED PATIENTLY FOR MONTHS AND HAD BEEN PUT OFF WITH IDLE PROMISES OR THRUST ASIDE WHILE EVERY GREEDY PUSHING PRIEST THAT ARRIVED FROM SPAIN AND ITALY WAS RECEIVED WITH OPEN ARMS AND A PLACE PROVIDED FOR HIM
1668-136280-0037 THEN WHEN HIS PATIENCE AND PRIVATE MEANS HAD BEEN EXHAUSTED HE HAD ACCIDENTLY BEEN THROWN AMONG THOSE WHO WERE NOT OF THE FAITH YET HAD RECEIVED HIM WITH OPEN ARMS
1668-136280-0038 HE HAD BEEN HUMILIATED AND PAINED AT THE DISINTERESTED HOSPITALITY AND CHRISTIAN CHARITY SHOWN TO HIM BY THOSE OUTSIDE THE PALE AFTER THE TREATMENT HE HAD RECEIVED FROM HIS FELLOW PRIESTS
1668-136280-0039 HE DID NOT GO SO FAR AS TO ACCEPT THAT OFFER HE WAS WISE IN HIS GENERATION AND EVENTUALLY GOT HIS REWARD OUR SCHOOLMASTER GONE WE WERE ONCE MORE BACK IN THE OLD WAY
1668-136280-0040 OUR PARENTS PROBABLY THOUGHT THAT OUR LIFE WOULD BE ON THE PLAINS WITH SHEEP AND CATTLE BREEDING FOR ONLY VOCATIONS AND THAT SHOULD ANY ONE OF US LIKE MY MATHEMATICAL MINDED BROTHER TAKE SOME LINE OF HIS OWN
1668-136280-0041 I HAD NO INCLINATION TO DO ANYTHING WITH BOOKS MYSELF BOOKS WERE LESSONS THEREFORE REPELLENT AND THAT ANY ONE SHOULD READ A BOOK FOR PLEASURE WAS INCONCEIVABLE
1668-136280-0042 THE ONLY ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE OUR MINDS AT THIS PERIOD CAME ODDLY ENOUGH FROM MY MASTERFUL BROTHER WHO DESPISED OUR BABYISH INTELLECTS ESPECIALLY MINE HOWEVER ONE DAY HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD A GRAND SCHEME TO PUT BEFORE US
1668-136280-0043 HE HAD HEARD OR READ OF A FAMILY OF BOYS LIVING JUST LIKE US IN SOME WILD ISOLATED LAND WHERE THERE WERE NO SCHOOLS OR TEACHERS AND NO NEWSPAPERS WHO AMUSED THEMSELVES BY WRITING A JOURNAL OF THEIR OWN WHICH WAS ISSUED ONCE A WEEK
1668-136280-0044 THERE WAS A BLUE PITCHER ON A SHELF IN THE HOUSE AND INTO THIS PITCHER EVERY BOY DROPPED HIS CONTRIBUTION AND ONE OF THEM OF COURSE THE MOST INTELLIGENT ONE CAREFULLY WENT THROUGH THEM
1668-136280-0045 SELECTED THE BEST AND COPIED THEM ALL OUT IN ONE LARGE SHEET AND THIS WAS THEIR WEEKLY JOURNAL CALLED THE BLUE PITCHER AND IT WAS READ AND ENJOYED BY THE WHOLE HOUSE
1668-136280-0046 HE PROPOSED THAT WE SHOULD DO THE SAME HE OF COURSE WOULD EDIT THE PAPER AND WRITE A LARGE PORTION OF IT IT WOULD OCCUPY TWO OR FOUR SHEETS OF QUARTO PAPER ALL IN HIS BEAUTIFUL HANDWRITING WHICH RESEMBLED COPPER PLATE AND IT WOULD BE ISSUED FOR ALL OF US TO READ EVERY SATURDAY
1668-136280-0047 WE ALL AGREED JOYFULLY AND AS THE TITLE HAD TAKEN OUR FANCY WE STARTED HUNTING FOR A BLUE PITCHER ALL OVER THE HOUSE BUT COULDN'T FIND SUCH A THING AND FINALLY HAD TO PUT UP WITH A TIN BOX WITH A WOODEN LID AND A LOCK AND KEY
1668-136280-0048 THE CONTRIBUTIONS WERE TO BE DROPPED IN THROUGH A SLIT IN THE LID WHICH THE CARPENTER MADE FOR US AND MY BROTHER TOOK POSSESSION OF THE KEY THE TITLE OF THE PAPER WAS TO BE THE TIN BOX AND WE WERE INSTRUCTED TO WRITE ABOUT THE HAPPENINGS OF THE WEEK AND ANYTHING IN FACT WHICH HAD INTERESTED US
1668-136280-0049 AND NOT TO BE SUCH LITTLE ASSES AS TO TRY TO DEAL WITH SUBJECTS WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT I WAS TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT BIRDS THERE WAS NEVER A WEEK WENT BY IN WHICH I DIDN'T TELL THEM A WONDERFUL STORY OF A STRANGE BIRD I HAD SEEN FOR THE FIRST TIME WELL
1668-136280-0050 I COULD WRITE ABOUT THAT STRANGE BIRD AND MAKE IT JUST AS WONDERFUL AS I LIKED WE SET ABOUT OUR TASK AT ONCE WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM TRYING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR LIVES TO PUT OUR THOUGHTS INTO WRITING ALL WENT WELL FOR A FEW DAYS
1668-136280-0051 THEN OUR EDITOR CALLED US TOGETHER TO HEAR AN IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION HE WISHED TO MAKE FIRST HE SHOWED US BUT WOULD NOT ALLOW US TO READ OR HANDLE A FAIR COPY OF THE PAPER OR OF THE PORTION HE HAD DONE JUST TO ENABLE US TO APPRECIATE THE CARE HE WAS TAKING OVER IT
1668-136280-0052 AND WOULD NOT BE MUCH MISSED TO THIS WE ALL AGREED AT ONCE EXCEPT MY YOUNGER BROTHER AGED ABOUT SEVEN AT THAT TIME THEN HE WAS TOLD HE WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE PAPER VERY WELL HE WOULDN'T CONTRIBUTE TO IT HE SAID
1668-136280-0053 IN VAIN WE ALL TRIED TO COAX HIM OUT OF HIS STUBBORN RESOLVE HE WOULD NOT PART WITH A COPPER OF HIS MONEY AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TIN BOX
1668-136280-0054 THEN THE EDITOR'S WRATH BROKE OUT AND HE SAID HE HAD ALREADY WRITTEN HIS EDITORIAL BUT WOULD NOW AS A CONCLUDING ARTICLE WRITE A SECOND ONE IN ORDER TO SHOW UP THE PERSON WHO HAD TRIED TO WRECK THE PAPER IN HIS TRUE COLOURS
1668-136280-0055 HE WOULD EXHIBIT HIM AS THE MEANEST MOST CONTEMPTIBLE INSECT THAT EVER CRAWLED ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS FURIOUS TIRADE MY POOR LITTLE BROTHER BURST OUT CRYING
1668-136280-0056 THEN WE ALL LAUGHED AND THE ANGRY EDITOR LAUGHED TOO PROUD OF THE EFFECT HIS WORDS HAD PRODUCED OUR LITTLE BROTHER DID NOT JOIN US AT PLAY THAT AFTERNOON
1668-136280-0057 HE WAS IN HIDING SOMEWHERE KEEPING WATCH ON THE MOVEMENTS OF HIS ENEMY WHO WAS NO DOUBT ENGAGED ALREADY IN WRITING THAT DREADFUL ARTICLE WHICH WOULD MAKE HIM A MARKED BEING FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
1668-136280-0058 IN DUE TIME THE EDITOR HIS TASK FINISHED CAME FORTH AND MOUNTING HIS HORSE GALLOPED OFF AND THE LITTLE WATCHER CAME OUT AND STEALING INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE TIN BOX WAS KEPT CARRIED IT OFF TO THE CARPENTER'S SHOP
1668-136280-0059 THERE WITH CHISEL AND HAMMER HE BROKE THE LID TO PIECES AND TAKING OUT ALL THE PAPERS SET TO WORK TO TEAR THEM UP INTO THE MINUTEST FRAGMENTS WHICH WERE CARRIED OUT AND SCATTERED ALL OVER THE PLACE
1668-136280-0060 WHEN THE BIG BROTHER CAME HOME AND DISCOVERED WHAT HAD BEEN DONE HE WAS IN A MIGHTY RAGE AND WENT OFF IN SEARCH OF THE AVARICIOUS LITTLE REBEL WHO HAD DARED TO DESTROY HIS WORK
1668-136280-0061 BUT THE LITTLE REBEL WAS NOT TO BE CAUGHT AT THE RIGHT MOMENT HE FLED FROM THE COMING TEMPEST TO HIS PARENTS AND CLAIMED THEIR PROTECTION
1668-136280-0062 THEN THE WHOLE MATTER HAD TO BE INQUIRED INTO AND THE BIG BOY WAS TOLD THAT HE WAS NOT TO THRASH HIS LITTLE BROTHER THAT HE HIMSELF WAS TO BLAME FOR EVERYTHING ON ACCOUNT OF THE EXTRAVAGANT LANGUAGE HE HAD USED WHICH THE POOR LITTLE FELLOW HAD TAKEN QUITE SERIOUSLY
1668-136280-0063 IF HE ACTUALLY BELIEVED THE TIN BOX ARTICLE WAS GOING TO HAVE THAT DISASTROUS EFFECT ON HIM WHO COULD BLAME HIM FOR DESTROYING IT THAT WAS THE END OF THE TIN BOX
1668-136280-0064 NOT A WORD ABOUT STARTING IT AFRESH WAS SAID AND FROM THAT DAY MY ELDER BROTHER NEVER MENTIONED IT BUT YEARS LATER I CAME TO THINK IT A GREAT PITY THAT THE SCHEME HAD MISCARRIED
1668-136280-0065 I BELIEVE FROM LATER EXPERIENCE THAT EVEN IF IT HAD LASTED BUT A FEW WEEKS IT WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME THE HABIT OF RECORDING MY OBSERVATIONS AND THAT IS A HABIT WITHOUT WHICH THE KEENEST OBSERVATION AND THE MOST FAITHFUL MEMORY ARE NOT SUFFICIENT FOR THE FIELD NATURALIST THUS
1668-136280-0066 THROUGH THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TIN BOX I BELIEVE I LOST A GREAT PART OF THE RESULT OF SIX YEARS OF LIFE WITH WILD NATURE
