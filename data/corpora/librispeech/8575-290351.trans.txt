8575-290351-0000 THEY BEING IDEAS OF GENERAL CONCERNMENT THAT HAVE SOMETHING VERY ABSTRUSE AND PECULIAR IN THEIR NATURE THE COMPARING THEM ONE WITH ANOTHER MAY PERHAPS BE OF USE FOR THEIR ILLUSTRATION AND WE MAY HAVE THE MORE CLEAR AND DISTINCT CONCEPTION OF THEM BY TAKING A VIEW OF THEM TOGETHER
8575-290351-0001 DISTANCE OR SPACE IN ITS SIMPLE ABSTRACT CONCEPTION TO AVOID CONFUSION I CALL EXPANSION TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM EXTENSION WHICH BY SOME IS USED TO EXPRESS THIS DISTANCE ONLY AS IT IS IN THE SOLID PARTS OF MATTER AND SO INCLUDES OR AT LEAST
8575-290351-0002 AS HAS BEEN SAID REPEAT THAT IDEA AND SO ADDING IT TO THE FORMER ENLARGE ITS IDEA OF LENGTH AND MAKE IT EQUAL TO TWO SPANS OR TWO PACES AND SO AS OFTEN AS IT WILL TILL IT EQUALS THE DISTANCE OF ANY PARTS OF THE EARTH ONE FROM ANOTHER
8575-290351-0003 AND INCREASE THUS TILL IT AMOUNTS TO THE DISTANCE OF THE SUN OR REMOTEST STAR BY SUCH A PROGRESSION AS THIS SETTING OUT FROM THE PLACE WHERE IT IS OR ANY OTHER PLACE IT CAN PROCEED AND PASS BEYOND ALL THOSE LENGTHS AND FIND NOTHING TO STOP ITS GOING ON EITHER IN OR WITHOUT BODY
8575-290351-0004 IT IS TRUE WE CAN EASILY IN OUR THOUGHTS COME TO THE END OF SOLID EXTENSION THE EXTREMITY AND BOUNDS OF ALL BODY WE HAVE NO DIFFICULTY TO ARRIVE AT BUT WHEN THE MIND IS THERE IT FINDS NOTHING TO HINDER ITS PROGRESS INTO THIS ENDLESS EXPANSION
8575-290351-0005 NOR DURATION BY MOTION JUST SO IS IT IN DURATION
8575-290351-0006 AND STICKS NOT TO ASCRIBE INFINITY TO DURATION BUT IT IS WITH MORE DOUBTING AND RESERVE THAT MANY ADMIT OR SUPPOSE THE INFINITY OF SPACE THE REASON WHEREOF SEEMS TO ME TO BE THIS
8575-290351-0007 THAT DURATION AND EXTENSION BEING USED AS NAMES OF AFFECTIONS BELONGING TO OTHER BEINGS WE EASILY CONCEIVE IN GOD INFINITE DURATION AND WE CANNOT AVOID DOING SO BUT NOT ATTRIBUTING TO HIM EXTENSION BUT ONLY TO MATTER WHICH IS FINITE
8575-290351-0008 WE ARE APTER TO DOUBT OF THE EXISTENCE OF EXPANSION WITHOUT MATTER OF WHICH ALONE WE COMMONLY SUPPOSE IT AN ATTRIBUTE AND THEREFORE WHEN MEN PURSUE THEIR THOUGHTS OF SPACE THEY ARE APT TO STOP AT THE CONFINES OF BODY AS IF SPACE WERE THERE AT AN END TOO
8575-290351-0009 ONE MAY HAVE OCCASION TO THINK BY THE NAME DURATION THAT THE CONTINUATION OF EXISTENCE WITH A KIND OF RESISTANCE TO ANY DESTRUCTIVE FORCE AND THE CONTINUATION OF SOLIDITY WHICH IS APT TO BE CONFOUNDED WITH AND IF WE WILL LOOK INTO THE MINUTE ANATOMICAL PARTS OF MATTER IS LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM HARDNESS
8575-290351-0010 BUT BE THAT AS IT WILL THIS IS CERTAIN THAT WHOEVER PURSUES HIS OWN THOUGHTS WILL FIND THEM SOMETIMES LAUNCH OUT BEYOND THE EXTENT OF BODY INTO THE INFINITY OF SPACE OR EXPANSION
8575-290351-0011 THE IDEA WHEREOF IS DISTINCT AND SEPARATE FROM BODY AND ALL OTHER THINGS WHICH MAY TO THOSE WHO PLEASE BE A SUBJECT OF FURTHER MEDITATION FIVE TIME TO DURATION IS AS PLACE TO EXPANSION TIME IN GENERAL IS TO DURATION AS PLACE TO EXPANSION
8575-290351-0012 THEY ARE SO MUCH OF THOSE BOUNDLESS OCEANS OF ETERNITY AND IMMENSITY AS IS SET OUT AND DISTINGUISHED FROM THE REST AS IT WERE BY LANDMARKS AND SO ARE MADE USE OF TO DENOTE THE POSITION OF FINITE REAL BEINGS IN RESPECT ONE TO ANOTHER
8575-290351-0013 FROM SUCH POINTS FIXED IN SENSIBLE BEINGS WE RECKON AND FROM THEM WE MEASURE OUR PORTIONS OF THOSE INFINITE QUANTITIES WHICH SO CONSIDERED ARE THAT WHICH WE CALL TIME AND PLACE
8575-290351-0014 SIX TIME AND PLACE ARE TAKEN FOR SO MUCH OF EITHER AS ARE SET OUT BY THE EXISTENCE AND MOTION OF BODIES TIME AND PLACE TAKEN THUS FOR DETERMINATE DISTINGUISHABLE PORTIONS OF THOSE INFINITE ABYSSES OF SPACE AND DURATION
8575-290351-0015 AND IN THIS SENSE TIME BEGINS AND ENDS WITH THE FRAME OF THIS SENSIBLE WORLD AS IN THESE PHRASES BEFORE MENTIONED BEFORE ALL TIME OR WHEN TIME SHALL BE NO MORE
8575-290351-0016 PLACE LIKEWISE IS TAKEN SOMETIMES FOR THAT PORTION OF INFINITE SPACE WHICH IS POSSESSED BY AND COMPREHENDED WITHIN THE MATERIAL WORLD AND IS THEREBY DISTINGUISHED FROM THE REST OF EXPANSION THOUGH THIS MAY BE MORE PROPERLY CALLED EXTENSION THAN PLACE
8575-290351-0017 SEVEN SOMETIMES FOR SO MUCH OF EITHER AS WE DESIGN BY MEASURES TAKEN FROM THE BULK OR MOTION OF BODIES SECONDLY SOMETIMES THE WORD TIME IS USED IN A LARGER SENSE AND IS APPLIED TO PARTS OF THAT INFINITE DURATION
8575-290351-0018 NOT THAT WERE REALLY DISTINGUISHED AND MEASURED OUT BY THIS REAL EXISTENCE AND PERIODICAL MOTIONS OF BODIES THAT WERE APPOINTED FROM THE BEGINNING TO BE FOR SIGNS AND FOR SEASONS AND FOR DAYS AND YEARS AND ARE ACCORDINGLY OUR MEASURES OF TIME
8575-290351-0019 BUT SUCH OTHER PORTIONS TOO OF THAT INFINITE UNIFORM DURATION WHICH WE UPON ANY OCCASION DO SUPPOSE EQUAL TO CERTAIN LENGTHS OF MEASURED TIME AND SO CONSIDER THEM AS BOUNDED AND DETERMINED FOR IF WE SHOULD SUPPOSE THE CREATION OR FALL OF THE ANGELS WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE JULIAN PERIOD
8575-290351-0020 WHEREBY WE WOULD MARK OUT SO MUCH OF THAT UNDISTINGUISHED DURATION AS WE SUPPOSE EQUAL TO AND WOULD HAVE ADMITTED
8575-290351-0021 AND THUS LIKEWISE WE SOMETIMES SPEAK OF PLACE DISTANCE OR BULK IN THE GREAT INANE BEYOND THE CONFINES OF THE WORLD WHEN WE CONSIDER SO MUCH OF THAT SPACE AS IS EQUAL TO OR CAPABLE TO RECEIVE A BODY OF ANY ASSIGNED DIMENSIONS AS A CUBIC FOOT OR DO SUPPOSE A POINT IN IT
8575-290351-0022 AND ARE BY US ALWAYS RECKONED FROM SOME KNOWN PARTS OF THIS SENSIBLE WORLD AND FROM SOME CERTAIN EPOCHS MARKED OUT TO US BY THE MOTIONS OBSERVABLE IN IT
8575-290351-0023 IN THE BOUNDLESS INVARIABLE OCEANS OF DURATION AND EXPANSION WHICH COMPREHEND IN THEM ALL FINITE BEINGS AND IN THEIR FULL EXTENT BELONG ONLY TO THE DEITY AND THEREFORE WE ARE NOT TO WONDER THAT WE COMPREHEND THEM NOT
8575-290351-0024 BUT WHEN APPLIED TO ANY PARTICULAR FINITE BEINGS THE EXTENSION OF ANY BODY IS SO MUCH OF THAT INFINITE SPACE AS THE BULK OF THE BODY TAKES UP AND PLACE IS THE POSITION OF ANY BODY WHEN CONSIDERED AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE FROM SOME OTHER AS THE IDEA OF THE PARTICULAR DURATION OF ANYTHING IS
8575-290351-0025 ONE SHOWS THE DISTANCE OF THE EXTREMITIES OF THE BULK OR EXISTENCE OF THE SAME THING AS THAT IT IS A FOOT SQUARE OR LASTED TWO YEARS THE OTHER SHOWS THE DISTANCE OF IT IN PLACE OR EXISTENCE FROM OTHER FIXED POINTS OF SPACE OR DURATION
8575-290351-0026 COME TO SO SMALL A PART OF EXTENSION OR DURATION AS EXCLUDED DIVISIBILITY THAT WOULD BE AS IT WERE THE INDIVISIBLE UNIT OR IDEA BY REPETITION OF WHICH IT WOULD MAKE ITS MORE ENLARGED IDEAS OF EXTENSION AND DURATION
8575-290351-0027 INSTEAD THEREOF IT MAKES USE OF THE COMMON MEASURES WHICH BY FAMILIAR USE IN EACH COUNTRY HAVE IMPRINTED THEMSELVES ON THE MEMORY AS INCHES AND FEET OR CUBITS AND PARASANGS AND SO SECONDS MINUTES HOURS DAYS AND YEARS IN DURATION
8575-290351-0028 ON THE OTHER SIDE THE ORDINARY SMALLEST MEASURE WE HAVE OF EITHER IS LOOKED ON AS AN UNIT IN NUMBER WHEN THE MIND BY DIVISION WOULD REDUCE THEM INTO LESS FRACTIONS THOUGH ON BOTH SIDES BOTH IN ADDITION AND DIVISION EITHER OF SPACE OR DURATION WHEN THE IDEA UNDER CONSIDERATION BECOMES VERY BIG OR VERY SMALL
8575-290351-0029 AS THE SIMPLE IDEAS OF THAT KIND OUT OF WHICH OUR COMPLEX MODES OF SPACE EXTENSION AND DURATION ARE MADE UP AND INTO WHICH THEY CAN AGAIN BE DISTINCTLY RESOLVED SUCH A SMALL PART IN DURATION MAY BE CALLED A MOMENT
8575-290351-0030 IN THE TRAIN OF THEIR ORDINARY SUCCESSION THERE THE OTHER WANTING A PROPER NAME I KNOW NOT WHETHER I MAY BE ALLOWED TO CALL A SENSIBLE POINT MEANING THEREBY THE LEAST PARTICLE OF MATTER OR SPACE WE CAN DISCERN WHICH IS ORDINARILY ABOUT A MINUTE
8575-290351-0031 BUT DURATION IS BUT AS IT WERE THE LENGTH OF ONE STRAIGHT LINE EXTENDED IN INFINITUM NOT CAPABLE OF MULTIPLICITY VARIATION OR FIGURE BUT IS ONE COMMON MEASURE OF ALL EXISTENCE WHATSOEVER WHEREIN ALL THINGS WHILST THEY EXIST EQUALLY PARTAKE
8575-290351-0032 FOR THIS PRESENT MOMENT IS COMMON TO ALL THINGS THAT ARE NOW IN BEING AND EQUALLY COMPREHENDS THAT PART OF THEIR EXISTENCE AS MUCH AS IF THEY WERE ALL BUT ONE SINGLE BEING AND WE MAY TRULY SAY THEY ALL EXIST IN THE SAME MOMENT OF TIME
8575-290351-0033 WITH A PERFECT NEGATION OF ALL MANNER OF EXPANSION AS IT IS TO HAVE THE IDEA OF ANY REAL EXISTENCE WITH A PERFECT NEGATION OF ALL MANNER OF DURATION AND THEREFORE WHAT SPIRITS HAVE TO DO WITH SPACE OR HOW THEY COMMUNICATE IN IT WE KNOW NOT
8575-290351-0034 DURATION AND TIME WHICH IS A PART OF IT IS THE IDEA WE HAVE OF PERISHING DISTANCE OF WHICH NO TWO PARTS EXIST TOGETHER BUT FOLLOW EACH OTHER IN SUCCESSION
8575-290351-0035 AND THEREFORE THOUGH WE CANNOT CONCEIVE ANY DURATION WITHOUT SUCCESSION NOR CAN PUT IT TOGETHER IN OUR THOUGHTS THAT ANY BEING DOES NOW EXIST TO MORROW OR POSSESS AT ONCE MORE THAN THE PRESENT MOMENT OF DURATION YET WE CAN CONCEIVE THE ETERNAL DURATION OF THE ALMIGHTY FAR DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF MAN
8575-290351-0036 OR ANY OTHER FINITE BEING BECAUSE MAN COMPREHENDS NOT IN HIS KNOWLEDGE OR POWER ALL PAST AND FUTURE THINGS HIS THOUGHTS ARE BUT OF YESTERDAY AND HE KNOWS NOT WHAT TO MORROW WILL BRING FORTH WHAT IS ONCE PAST HE CAN NEVER RECAL AND WHAT IS YET TO COME HE CANNOT MAKE PRESENT
8575-290351-0037 WHAT I SAY OF MAN I SAY OF ALL FINITE BEINGS WHO THOUGH THEY MAY FAR EXCEED MAN IN KNOWLEDGE AND POWER YET ARE NO MORE THAN THE MEANEST CREATURE IN COMPARISON WITH GOD HIMSELF FINITE OR
