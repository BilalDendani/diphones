3851-9210-0000 BY A PHENOMENON OF VISION OR OF LOCOMOTION HAS BEEN KNOWN AT TIMES TO ABOLISH SPACE IN ITS TWO MODES OF TIME AND DISTANCE THE ONE INTELLECTUAL THE OTHER PHYSICAL HISTORY OF LOUIS LAMBERT
3851-9210-0001 ON A NOVEMBER EVENING IN THE YEAR SEVENTEEN NINETY THREE
3851-9210-0002 BUT AN UNWONTED INTEREST ATTACHED TO THIS EVENING'S GATHERING
3851-9210-0003 THOUGH IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN THEY EXCITED THE GREATEST CURIOSITY FOR TWO DAYS BEFORE
3851-9210-0004 AND ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING HER DOOR HAD BEEN SHUT ON THE GROUND OF INDISPOSITION
3851-9210-0005 EXISTENCE IS IN SOME SORT INCOMPLETE BUT IN THOSE TIMES WHEN THE LEAST INDISCRETION ON THE PART OF AN ARISTOCRAT MIGHT BE A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH
3851-9210-0006 MANY A ONE DURING THE DAYS OF THE REVOLUTION HAS DOUBTLESS PASSED THROUGH A CRISIS AS DIFFICULT AS HERS AT THAT MOMENT AND THE SYMPATHIES OF MORE THAN ONE READER WILL FILL IN ALL THE COLORING OF THE PICTURE
3851-9210-0007 A KNIGHT OF THE ORDERS OF SAINT MICHAEL AND OF THE HOLY GHOST SHE HAD LEFT THE COURT WHEN THE EMIGRATION BEGAN AND TAKEN REFUGE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF CARENTAN WHERE SHE HAD LARGE ESTATES HOPING THAT THE INFLUENCE OF THE REIGN OF TERROR WOULD BE BUT LITTLE FELT THERE
3851-9210-0008 HER CIRCLE OF ACQUAINTANCE HAD BEEN CONFINED TO THE NOBLE FAMILIES OF THE DISTRICT BUT NOW FROM POLITIC MOTIVES SHE OPENED HER HOUSE TO THE PRINCIPAL CITIZENS AND TO THE REVOLUTIONARY AUTHORITIES OF THE TOWN ENDEAVORING TO TOUCH AND GRATIFY THEIR SOCIAL PRIDE
3851-9210-0009 WITHOUT AROUSING EITHER HATRED OR JEALOUSY GRACIOUS AND KINDLY POSSESSED OF THE INDESCRIBABLE CHARM THAT WINS GOOD WILL WITHOUT LOSS OF DIGNITY OR EFFORT TO PAY COURT TO ANY SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN GAINING UNIVERSAL ESTEEM
3851-9210-0010 THE DISCREET WARNINGS OF EXQUISITE TACT ENABLED HER TO STEER A DIFFICULT COURSE AMONG THE EXACTING CLAIMS OF THIS MIXED SOCIETY WITHOUT WOUNDING THE OVERWEENING SELF LOVE OF PARVENUS ON THE ONE HAND
3851-9210-0011 OR THE SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF HER OLD FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SHE WAS ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE AND STILL PRESERVED NOT THE FRESH HIGH COLORED BEAUTY OF THE BASSE NORMANDES BUT A FRAGILE LOVELINESS OF WHAT MAY BE CALLED AN ARISTOCRATIC TYPE
3851-9210-0012 HER FIGURE WAS LISSOME AND SLENDER HER FEATURES DELICATE AND CLEARLY CUT THE PALE FACE SEEMED TO LIGHT UP AND LIVE WHEN SHE SPOKE BUT THERE WAS A QUIET AND DEVOUT LOOK IN THE GREAT DARK EYES FOR ALL THEIR GRACIOUSNESS OF EXPRESSION
3851-9210-0013 A LOOK THAT SEEMED TO SAY THAT THE SPRINGS OF HER LIFE LAY WITHOUT HER OWN EXISTENCE IN HER EARLY GIRLHOOD SHE HAD BEEN MARRIED TO AN ELDERLY AND JEALOUS SOLDIER HER FALSE POSITION IN THE MIDST OF A GAY COURT HAD DOUBTLESS DONE SOMETHING
3851-9210-0014 AND THE DEPTHS OF PASSION IN HER HEART HAD NEVER BEEN STIRRED IN THIS LAY THE SECRET OF HER GREATEST CHARM A YOUTHFULNESS OF THE INMOST SOUL BETRAYED AT TIMES BY HER FACE AND A CERTAIN TINGE OF INNOCENT WISTFULNESS IN HER IDEAS
3851-9210-0015 SHE WAS RESERVED IN HER DEMEANOR BUT IN HER BEARING AND IN THE TONES OF HER VOICE THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING THAT TOLD OF GIRLISH LONGINGS DIRECTED TOWARD A VAGUE FUTURE BEFORE VERY LONG THE LEAST SUSCEPTIBLE FELL IN LOVE WITH HER
3851-9210-0016 AND YET STOOD SOMEWHAT IN AWE OF HER DIGNITY AND HIGH BRED MANNER HER GREAT SOUL STRENGTHENED BY THE CRUEL ORDEALS THROUGH WHICH SHE HAD PASSED SEEMED TO SET HER TOO FAR ABOVE THE ORDINARY LEVEL
3851-9210-0017 AND THESE MEN WEIGHED THEMSELVES AND INSTINCTIVELY FELT THAT THEY WERE FOUND WANTING SUCH A NATURE DEMANDED AN EXALTED PASSION MOREOVER
3851-9210-0018 A MOTHER'S LOVE FOR HER SON ALL THE HAPPINESS AND JOY THAT SHE HAD NOT KNOWN AS A WIFE SHE HAD FOUND LATER IN HER BOUNDLESS LOVE FOR HIM THE COQUETRY OF A MISTRESS THE JEALOUSY OF A WIFE MINGLED WITH THE PURE AND DEEP AFFECTION OF A MOTHER
3851-9210-0019 BUT ALL SHE HAD OF KITH OR KIN IN THE WORLD THE ONE HUMAN BEING ON EARTH BOUND TO HER BY ALL THE FEARS AND HOPES AND JOYS OF HER LIFE THE LATE COMTE DE DEY WAS THE LAST OF HIS RACE AND SHE HIS WIFE
3851-9210-0020 THE CHILD WAS ALL THE DEARER BECAUSE ONLY WITH INFINITE CARE HAD SHE SUCCEEDED IN REARING HIM TO MAN'S ESTATE MEDICAL SCIENCE HAD PREDICTED HIS DEATH A SCORE OF TIMES BUT SHE HAD HELD FAST TO HER PRESENTIMENTS AND HER HOPES
3851-9210-0021 AND HAD KNOWN THE INEXPRESSIBLE JOY OF WATCHING HIM PASS SAFELY THROUGH THE PERILS OF INFANCY OF SEEING HIS CONSTITUTION STRENGTHEN IN SPITE OF THE DECREES OF THE FACULTY THANKS TO HER CONSTANT CARE
3851-9210-0022 THE BOY HAD GROWN UP AND DEVELOPED SO FAVORABLY THAT AT TWENTY YEARS OF AGE HE WAS REGARDED AS ONE OF THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED GENTLEMEN AT THE COURT OF VERSAILLES ONE FINAL HAPPINESS THAT DOES NOT ALWAYS CROWN A MOTHER'S EFFORTS WAS HERS HER SON WORSHIPED HER
3851-9210-0023 AND BETWEEN THESE TWO THERE WAS THE DEEP SYMPATHY OF KINDRED SOULS
3851-9210-0024 THEY WOULD INSTINCTIVELY HAVE FELT FOR EACH OTHER A FRIENDSHIP THAT IS RARELY MET WITH BETWEEN TWO MEN
3851-9210-0025 AND HAD MADE IT A POINT OF HONOR TO FOLLOW THE EMIGRANT PRINCES INTO EXILE
3851-9210-0026 SHE WAS RICH NOBLE AND THE MOTHER OF AN EMIGRANT WITH THE ONE DESIRE TO LOOK AFTER HER SON'S GREAT FORTUNE SHE HAD DENIED HERSELF THE HAPPINESS OF BEING WITH HIM
3851-9210-0027 AND WHEN SHE READ THE RIGOROUS LAWS IN VIRTUE OF WHICH THE REPUBLIC WAS DAILY CONFISCATING THE PROPERTY OF EMIGRANTS AT CARENTAN SHE CONGRATULATED HERSELF ON THE COURAGEOUS COURSE THAT SHE HAD TAKEN
3851-9210-0028 WAS SHE NOT KEEPING WATCH OVER THE WEALTH OF HER SON AT THE RISK OF HER LIFE LATER WHEN NEWS CAME OF THE HORRIBLE EXECUTIONS ORDERED BY THE CONVENTION SHE SLEPT HAPPY IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HER OWN TREASURE WAS IN SAFETY OUT OF REACH OF PERIL
3851-9210-0029 FAR FROM THE SCAFFOLDS OF THE REVOLUTION SHE LOVED TO THINK THAT SHE HAD FOLLOWED THE BEST COURSE THAT SHE HAD SAVED HER DARLING AND HER DARLING'S FORTUNES AND TO THIS SECRET THOUGHT SHE MADE SUCH CONCESSIONS AS THE MISFORTUNES OF THE TIMES DEMANDED
3851-9210-0030 AND MADE HERSELF NECESSARY TO THE WELL TO DO BY PROVIDING AMUSEMENTS FOR THEM THE PROCUREUR OF THE COMMUNE MIGHT BE SEEN AT HER HOUSE THE MAYOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE DISTRICT AND THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR
3851-9210-0031 AND EVEN THE JUDGES OF THE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNALS WENT THERE THE FOUR FIRST NAMED GENTLEMEN WERE NONE OF THEM MARRIED
3851-9210-0032 EITHER FROM FEAR OF MAKING AN ENEMY OR FROM A DESIRE TO FIND A PROTECTOR THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR ONCE AN ATTORNEY AT CAEN AND THE COUNTESS'S MAN OF BUSINESS DID WHAT HE COULD TO INSPIRE LOVE BY A SYSTEM OF DEVOTION AND GENEROSITY
3851-9210-0033 BUT IN DESPITE OF THE DANGER OF MATCHING HERSELF AGAINST NORMAN CUNNING SHE USED ALL THE CRAFT AND INVENTIVENESS THAT NATURE HAS BESTOWED ON WOMEN TO PLAY OFF THE RIVAL SUITORS ONE AGAINST ANOTHER SHE HOPED BY GAINING TIME
3851-9210-0034 SO DEEP AND SINCERE WAS THE INTEREST THAT SHE INSPIRED THAT THOSE WHO USUALLY FILLED HER DRAWING ROOM FELT A LIVELY ANXIETY WHEN THE NEWS WAS SPREAD THEN WITH THE FRANK CURIOSITY CHARACTERISTIC OF PROVINCIAL MANNERS
3851-9210-0035 THEY WENT TO INQUIRE INTO THE MISFORTUNE GRIEF OR ILLNESS
3851-9210-0036 TO ALL THESE QUESTIONS BRIGITTE THE HOUSEKEEPER ANSWERED WITH THE SAME FORMULA HER MISTRESS WAS KEEPING HER ROOM AND WOULD SEE NO ONE NOT EVEN HER OWN SERVANTS
3851-9210-0037 THE JOKE WAS HAZARDED DISCREETLY WOMEN AND MEN ELDERLY FOLK AND YOUNG GIRLS
3851-9210-0038 EVERYONE IMAGINED THAT THERE WAS SOME SECRET IN IT AND EVERY HEAD WAS BUSY WITH THE SECRET NEXT DAY THE SUSPICIONS BECAME MALIGNANT EVERYONE LIVES IN PUBLIC IN A SMALL TOWN
3851-9210-0039 AND THE WOMEN KIND WERE THE FIRST TO FIND OUT THAT BRIGITTE HAD LAID IN AN EXTRA STOCK OF PROVISIONS THE THING COULD NOT BE DISPUTED
3851-9210-0040 AND WONDERFUL TO RELATE SHE HAD BOUGHT THE ONE HARE TO BE HAD
3851-9210-0041 ELDERLY GENTLEMEN TAKING THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL NOTICED A SORT OF SUPPRESSED BUSTLE IN THE COUNTESS'S HOUSE THE SYMPTOMS WERE THE MORE APPARENT BECAUSE THE SERVANTS WERE AT EVIDENT PAINS TO CONCEAL THEM
3851-9210-0042 THE MAN SERVANT WAS BEATING A CARPET IN THE GARDEN ONLY YESTERDAY NO ONE WOULD HAVE REMARKED THE FACT BUT TO DAY EVERYBODY BEGAN TO BUILD ROMANCES UPON THAT HARMLESS PIECE OF HOUSEHOLD STUFF EVERYONE HAD A VERSION ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
3851-9210-0043 THE MAGNATES OF CARENTAN WENT TO SPEND THE EVENING AT THE MAYOR'S BROTHER'S HOUSE HE WAS A RETIRED MERCHANT A MARRIED MAN A STRICTLY HONORABLE SOUL EVERYONE RESPECTED HIM AND THE COUNTESS HELD HIM IN HIGH REGARD
3851-9210-0044 THERE ALL THE RICH WIDOWS SUITORS WERE FAIN TO INVENT MORE OR LESS PROBABLE FICTIONS EACH ONE THINKING THE WHILE HOW TO TURN TO HIS OWN ADVANTAGE THE SECRET THAT COMPELLED HER TO COMPROMISE HERSELF IN SUCH A MANNER
3851-9210-0045 THE MAYOR HAD A BELIEF IN A PRIEST WHO HAD REFUSED THE OATH
3851-9210-0046 BUT THIS LEFT HIM NOT A LITTLE EMBARRASSED HOW TO ACCOUNT FOR THE PURCHASE OF A HARE ON A FRIDAY THE PRESIDENT OF THE DISTRICT HAD STRONG LEANINGS TOWARD A CHOUAN CHIEF
3851-9210-0047 OTHERS VOTED FOR A NOBLE ESCAPED FROM THE PRISONS OF PARIS IN SHORT ONE AND ALL SUSPECTED THAT THE COUNTESS HAD BEEN GUILTY OF SOME PIECE OF GENEROSITY THAT THE LAW OF THOSE DAYS DEFINED AS A CRIME
3851-9210-0048 THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR MOREOVER SAID IN A LOW VOICE THAT THEY MUST HUSH THE MATTER UP AND TRY TO SAVE THE UNFORTUNATE LADY FROM THE ABYSS TOWARD WHICH SHE WAS HASTENING IF YOU SPREAD REPORTS ABOUT HE ADDED
3851-9210-0049 I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO TAKE COGNIZANCE OF THE MATTER AND TO SEARCH THE HOUSE AND THEN HE SAID NO MORE BUT EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS LEFT UNSAID THE COUNTESS'S REAL FRIENDS WERE SO MUCH ALARMED FOR HER THAT ON THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY
3851-9210-0050 THE OLD MERCHANT TOOK A BOLDER STEP HE CALLED THAT MORNING UPON THE LADY STRONG IN THE THOUGHT OF THE SERVICE HE MEANT TO DO HER
3851-9210-0051 AND WAS AMAZED BEYOND EXPRESSION TO FIND HER OUT IN THE GARDEN BUSY GATHERING THE LAST AUTUMN FLOWERS IN HER BORDERS TO FILL THE VASES SHE HAS GIVEN REFUGE TO HER LOVER NO DOUBT THOUGHT THE OLD MAN STRUCK WITH PITY FOR THE CHARMING WOMAN BEFORE HIM
3851-9210-0052 THE COUNTESS'S FACE WORE A STRANGE LOOK THAT CONFIRMED HIS SUSPICIONS DEEPLY MOVED BY THE DEVOTION SO NATURAL TO WOMEN
3851-9210-0053 BUT THAT ALWAYS TOUCHES US BECAUSE ALL MEN ARE FLATTERED BY THE SACRIFICES THAT ANY WOMAN MAKES FOR ANY ONE OF THEM THE MERCHANT TOLD THE COUNTESS OF THE GOSSIP THAT WAS CIRCULATING IN THE TOWN AND SHOWED HER THE DANGER THAT SHE WAS RUNNING HE WOUND UP AT LAST WITH SAYING THAT
3851-9210-0054 IF THERE ARE SOME OF OUR PUBLIC FUNCTIONARIES WHO ARE SUFFICIENTLY READY TO PARDON A PIECE OF HEROISM ON YOUR PART SO LONG AS IT IS A PRIEST THAT YOU WISH TO SAVE NO ONE WILL SHOW YOU ANY MERCY IF IT IS DISCOVERED THAT YOU ARE SACRIFICING YOURSELF TO THE DICTATES OF YOUR HEART
3851-9210-0055 THAT MADE HIM TREMBLE OLD THOUGH HE WAS COME IN SHE SAID
3851-9210-0056 AND AS SOON AS SHE HAD ASSURED HERSELF THAT THEY WERE ALONE SHE DREW A SOILED TORN LETTER FROM HER BODICE READ IT SHE CRIED WITH A VIOLENT EFFORT TO PRONOUNCE THE WORDS SHE DROPPED AS IF EXHAUSTED INTO HER ARMCHAIR
3851-9210-0057 WHILE THE OLD MERCHANT LOOKED FOR HIS SPECTACLES AND WIPED THEM SHE RAISED HER EYES AND FOR THE FIRST TIME LOOKED AT HIM WITH CURIOSITY THEN IN AN UNCERTAIN VOICE I TRUST IN YOU SHE SAID SOFTLY
3851-9210-0058 HE UNDERSTOOD THE COUNTESS'S JOY AND HER PROSTRATION HER SON HAD TAKEN PART IN THE GRANVILLE EXPEDITION HE WROTE TO HIS MOTHER FROM HIS PRISON AND THE LETTER BROUGHT HER A SAD SWEET HOPE
3851-9210-0059 FEELING NO DOUBTS AS TO HIS MEANS OF ESCAPE HE WROTE THAT WITHIN THREE DAYS HE WAS SURE TO REACH HER DISGUISED THE SAME LETTER THAT BROUGHT THESE WEIGHTY TIDINGS WAS FULL OF HEARTRENDING FAREWELLS IN CASE THE WRITER SHOULD NOT BE IN CARENTAN BY THE EVENING OF THE THIRD DAY
3851-9210-0060 AND HE IMPLORED HIS MOTHER TO SEND A CONSIDERABLE SUM OF MONEY BY THE BEARER WHO HAD GONE THROUGH DANGERS INNUMERABLE TO DELIVER IT THE PAPER SHOOK IN THE OLD MAN'S HANDS
3851-9210-0061 WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE AND SHE BROKE OFF I AM SURE OF MY BROTHER THE OLD MERCHANT WENT ON I WILL ENGAGE HIM IN YOUR INTERESTS THE MERCHANT IN THIS CRISIS RECOVERED HIS OLD BUSINESS SHREWDNESS
3851-9210-0062 AFTER THE TWO HAD AGREED TOGETHER AS TO WHAT THEY WERE TO DO AND SAY THE OLD MERCHANT WENT ON VARIOUS INGENIOUS PRETEXTS TO PAY VISITS TO THE PRINCIPAL HOUSES OF CARENTAN
3851-9210-0063 AND THAT IN SPITE OF HER INDISPOSITION SHE WOULD RECEIVE THAT EVENING MATCHING HIS SHREWDNESS AGAINST NORMAN WITS IN THE CROSS EXAMINATION HE UNDERWENT IN EVERY FAMILY AS TO THE COUNTESS'S COMPLAINT
3851-9210-0064 HE SUCCEEDED IN PUTTING ALMOST EVERYONE WHO TOOK AN INTEREST IN THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR UPON THE WRONG SCENT HIS VERY FIRST CALL WORKED WONDERS HE TOLD IN THE HEARING OF A GOUTY OLD LADY HOW THAT
3851-9210-0065 HOW THAT THE ILLUSTRIOUS TRONCHIN HAD RECOMMENDED HER IN SUCH A CASE TO PUT THE SKIN FROM A LIVE HARE ON HER CHEST TO STOP IN BED AND KEEP PERFECTLY STILL THE COUNTESS HE SAID HAD LAIN IN DANGER OF HER LIFE FOR THE PAST TWO DAYS
3851-9210-0066 BUT AFTER CAREFULLY FOLLOWING OUT TRONCHIN'S SINGULAR PRESCRIPTION SHE WAS NOW SUFFICIENTLY RECOVERED TO RECEIVE VISITORS THAT EVENING THIS TALE HAD AN IMMENSE SUCCESS IN CARENTAN
3851-9210-0067 ADDED TO ITS EFFECT BY GRAVELY DISCUSSING THE SPECIFIC SUSPICION NEVERTHELESS HAD TAKEN TOO DEEP ROOT IN A FEW PERVERSE OR PHILOSOPHICAL MINDS TO BE ENTIRELY DISSIPATED SO IT FELL OUT THAT THOSE
3851-9210-0068 HURRIED THITHER AT AN EARLY HOUR SOME TO WATCH HER FACE SOME OUT OF FRIENDSHIP BUT THE MORE PART ATTRACTED BY THE FAME OF THE MARVELOUS CURE THEY FOUND THE COUNTESS SEATED IN A CORNER OF THE GREAT CHIMNEY PIECE IN HER ROOM
3851-9210-0069 WHICH WAS ALMOST AS MODESTLY FURNISHED AS SIMILAR APARTMENTS IN CARENTAN FOR SHE HAD GIVEN UP THE ENJOYMENT OF LUXURIES TO WHICH SHE HAD FORMERLY BEEN ACCUSTOMED FOR FEAR OF OFFENDING THE NARROW PREJUDICES OF HER GUESTS AND SHE HAD MADE NO CHANGES IN HER HOUSE
3851-9210-0070 THE FLOOR WAS NOT EVEN POLISHED SHE HAD LEFT THE OLD SOMBER HANGINGS ON THE WALLS HAD KEPT THE OLD FASHIONED COUNTRY FURNITURE BURNED TALLOW CANDLES
3851-9210-0071 HAD FALLEN IN WITH THE WAYS OF THE PLACE AND ADOPTED PROVINCIAL LIFE WITHOUT FLINCHING BEFORE ITS CAST IRON NARROWNESS ITS MOST DISAGREEABLE HARDSHIPS BUT KNOWING THAT HER GUESTS WOULD FORGIVE HER FOR ANY PRODIGALITY THAT CONDUCED TO THEIR COMFORT
3851-9210-0072 AND BORE WITH THEIR TRIVIAL PROSINGS EVERY TIME THERE WAS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR AT EVERY SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS IN THE STREET SHE HID HER AGITATION BY RAISING QUESTIONS OF ABSORBING INTEREST TO THE COUNTRYSIDE
3851-9210-0073 HER SELF POSSESSION WAS UNSHAKEN THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR AND ONE OF THE JUDGES OF THE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL KEPT SILENCE HOWEVER NOTING THE SLIGHTEST CHANGE THAT FLICKERED OVER HER FEATURES LISTENING THROUGH THE NOISY TALK TO EVERY SOUND IN THE HOUSE
3851-9210-0074 SEVERAL TIMES THEY PUT AWKWARD QUESTIONS WHICH THE COUNTESS ANSWERED WITH WONDERFUL PRESENCE OF MIND SO BRAVE IS A MOTHER'S HEART
3851-9210-0075 HAD MADE PARTIES OF WHIST BOSTON OR REVERSIS AND SAT TALKING WITH SOME OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE SHE SEEMED TO BE LIVING COMPLETELY IN THE PRESENT MOMENT AND PLAYED HER PART LIKE A CONSUMMATE ACTRESS SHE ELICITED A SUGGESTION OF LOTO
3851-9210-0076 AND SAYING THAT NO ONE ELSE KNEW WHERE TO FIND THE GAME SHE LEFT THE ROOM MY GOOD BRIGITTE I CANNOT BREATHE DOWN THERE SHE CRIED BRUSHING AWAY THE TEARS THAT SPRANG TO HER EYES THAT GLITTERED WITH FEVER SORROW AND IMPATIENCE
3851-9210-0077 SHE HAD GONE UP TO HER SON'S ROOM AND WAS LOOKING ROUND IT HE DOES NOT COME SHE SAID HERE I CAN BREATHE AND LIVE A FEW MINUTES MORE AND HE WILL BE HERE FOR HE IS ALIVE I AM SURE THAT HE IS ALIVE MY HEART TELLS ME SO
3851-9210-0078 DO YOU HEAR NOTHING BRIGITTE OH I WOULD GIVE THE REST OF MY LIFE TO KNOW WHETHER HE IS STILL IN PRISON OR TRAMPING ACROSS THE COUNTRY I WOULD RATHER NOT THINK ONCE MORE SHE LOOKED TO SEE THAT EVERYTHING WAS IN ORDER
3851-9210-0079 A BRIGHT FIRE BLAZED ON THE HEARTH THE SHUTTERS WERE CAREFULLY CLOSED THE FURNITURE SHONE WITH CLEANLINESS THE BED HAD BEEN MADE AFTER A FASHION THAT SHOWED THAT BRIGITTE AND THE COUNTESS HAD GIVEN THEIR MINDS TO EVERY TRIFLING DETAIL
3851-9210-0080 CLEAN LINEN SLIPPERS NO NECESSARY NO COMFORT WAS LACKING FOR THE WEARY TRAVELER AND ALL THE DELIGHTS OF HOME HEAPED UPON HIM SHOULD REVEAL HIS MOTHER'S LOVE OH BRIGITTE CRIED THE COUNTESS
3851-9210-0081 WITH A HEART RENDING INFLECTION IN HER VOICE SHE DREW A CHAIR TO THE TABLE AS IF TO STRENGTHEN HER ILLUSIONS AND REALIZE HER LONGINGS AH MADAME HE IS COMING HE IS NOT FAR OFF I HAVEN'T A DOUBT THAT HE IS LIVING AND ON HIS WAY BRIGITTE ANSWERED
3851-9210-0082 I PUT A KEY IN THE BIBLE AND HELD IT ON MY FINGERS WHILE COTTIN READ THE GOSPEL OF SAINT JOHN AND THE KEY DID NOT TURN MADAME IS THAT A CERTAIN SIGN THE COUNTESS ASKED WHY YES MADAME EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT HE IS STILL ALIVE
3851-9210-0083 I WOULD STAKE MY SALVATION ON IT GOD CANNOT BE MISTAKEN IF ONLY I COULD SEE HIM HERE IN THE HOUSE IN SPITE OF THE DANGER
3851-9210-0084 ALL THOSE PREPARATIONS MADE FOR HIM MEANT THAT HE WAS ALIVE SHE WENT DOWN BUT SHE LINGERED A MOMENT IN THE PERISTYLE FOR ANY SOUND THAT MIGHT WAKEN THE SLEEPING ECHOES OF THE TOWN SHE SMILED AT BRIGITTE'S HUSBAND WHO WAS STANDING THERE ON GUARD
3851-9210-0085 THE MAN'S EYES LOOKED STUPID WITH THE STRAIN OF LISTENING TO THE FAINT SOUNDS OF THE NIGHT SHE STARED INTO THE DARKNESS SEEING HER SON IN EVERY SHADOW EVERYWHERE BUT IT WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT THEN SHE WENT BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM WITH AN ASSUMPTION OF HIGH SPIRITS
3851-9210-0086 BUT FROM TIME TO TIME SHE COMPLAINED OF FEELING UNWELL AND WENT TO SIT IN HER GREAT CHAIR BY THE FIRESIDE
3851-9210-0087 MEANWHILE ON THE ROAD FROM PARIS TO CHERBOURG A YOUNG MAN DRESSED IN THE INEVITABLE BROWN CARMAGNOLE OF THOSE DAYS WAS PLODDING HIS WAY TOWARD CARENTAN WHEN THE FIRST LEVIES WERE MADE
3851-9210-0088 THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO DISCIPLINE KEPT UP THE EXIGENCIES OF THE MOMENT SCARCELY ADMITTED OF SOLDIERS BEING EQUIPPED AT ONCE AND IT WAS NO UNCOMMON THING TO SEE THE ROADS THRONGED WITH CONSCRIPTS IN THEIR ORDINARY CLOTHES
3851-9210-0089 THE YOUNG FELLOWS WENT AHEAD OF THEIR COMPANY TO THE NEXT HALTING PLACE OR LAGGED BEHIND IT IT DEPENDED UPON THEIR FITNESS TO BEAR THE FATIGUES OF A LONG MARCH THIS PARTICULAR WAYFARER WAS SOME CONSIDERABLE WAY IN ADVANCE OF A COMPANY OF CONSCRIPTS ON THE WAY TO CHERBOURG
3851-9210-0090 WHOM THE MAYOR WAS EXPECTING TO ARRIVE EVERY HOUR FOR IT WAS HIS DUTY TO DISTRIBUTE THEIR BILLETS THE YOUNG MAN'S FOOTSTEPS WERE STILL FIRM AS HE TRUDGED ALONG AND HIS BEARING SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT HE WAS NO STRANGER TO THE ROUGH LIFE OF A SOLDIER
3851-9210-0091 THE MOON SHONE ON THE PASTURE LAND ABOUT CARENTAN BUT HE HAD NOTICED GREAT MASSES OF WHITE CLOUD THAT WERE ABOUT TO SCATTER SHOWERS OF SNOW OVER THE COUNTRY
3851-9210-0092 AND WAS OBLIGED TO ASK THE WAY TO THE MAYOR'S HOUSE OF A WEAVER WHO WAS WORKING LATE THE MAGISTRATE WAS NOT FAR TO SEEK AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE CONSCRIPT WAS SITTING ON A STONE BENCH IN THE MAYOR'S PORCH WAITING FOR HIS BILLET HE WAS SENT FOR HOWEVER
3851-9210-0093 AND CONFRONTED WITH THAT FUNCTIONARY WHO SCRUTINIZED HIM CLOSELY THE FOOT SOLDIER WAS A GOOD LOOKING YOUNG MAN WHO APPEARED TO BE OF GENTLE BIRTH THERE WAS SOMETHING ARISTOCRATIC IN HIS BEARING AND SIGNS IN HIS FACE OF INTELLIGENCE DEVELOPED BY A GOOD EDUCATION
3851-9210-0094 REMARKED THE NORMAN IN SARCASTIC TONES I AM THREE LEAGUES AHEAD OF THE BATTALION SOME SENTIMENT ATTRACTS YOU TO CARENTAN OF COURSE CITIZEN CONSCRIPT SAID THE MAYOR ASTUTELY
3851-9210-0095 ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT HE ADDED WITH A WAVE OF THE HAND SEEING THAT THE YOUNG MAN WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK WE KNOW WHERE TO SEND YOU
3851-9210-0096 AND HE HANDED OVER THE BILLET
3851-9210-0097 THE CONSCRIPT READ THE DIRECTION CURIOUSLY HE KNOWS QUITE WELL THAT HE HAS NOT FAR TO GO
3851-9210-0098 HE IS UNCOMMONLY BOLD GOD GUIDE HIM HE HAS AN ANSWER READY FOR EVERYTHING
3851-9210-0099 THE CLOCKS IN CARENTAN STRUCK HALF PAST NINE AS HE SPOKE
3851-9210-0100 SERVANTS WERE HELPING THEIR MASTERS AND MISTRESSES INTO SABOTS GREATCOATS AND CALASHES THE CARD PLAYERS SETTLED THEIR ACCOUNTS AND EVERYBODY WENT OUT TOGETHER AFTER THE FASHION OF ALL LITTLE COUNTRY TOWNS
3851-9210-0101 IT LOOKS AS IF THE PROSECUTOR MEANT TO STOP SAID A LADY WHO NOTICED THAT THAT IMPORTANT PERSONAGE WAS NOT IN THE GROUP IN THE MARKET PLACE WHERE THEY ALL TOOK LEAVE OF ONE ANOTHER BEFORE GOING THEIR SEPARATE WAYS HOME AND AS A MATTER OF FACT
3851-9210-0102 THAT REDOUBTABLE FUNCTIONARY WAS ALONE WITH THE COUNTESS WHO WAITED TREMBLING TILL HE SHOULD GO THERE WAS SOMETHING APPALLING IN THEIR LONG SILENCE
3851-9210-0103 I AM HERE TO SEE THAT THE LAWS OF THE REPUBLIC ARE CARRIED OUT
3851-9210-0104 HAVE YOU NOTHING TO TELL ME NOTHING SHE ANSWERED IN AMAZEMENT AH MADAME CRIED THE PROSECUTOR SITTING DOWN BESIDE HER AND CHANGING HIS TONE AT THIS MOMENT FOR LACK OF A WORD ONE OF US YOU OR I
3851-9210-0105 MAY CARRY OUR HEADS TO THE SCAFFOLD I HAVE WATCHED YOUR CHARACTER YOUR SOUL YOUR MANNER TOO CLOSELY TO SHARE THE ERROR INTO WHICH YOU HAVE MANAGED TO LEAD YOUR VISITORS TO NIGHT YOU ARE EXPECTING YOUR SON I COULD NOT DOUBT IT
3851-9210-0106 THE COUNTESS MADE AN INVOLUNTARY SIGN OF DENIAL BUT HER FACE HAD GROWN WHITE AND DRAWN WITH THE STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN THE COMPOSURE THAT SHE DID NOT FEEL AND NO TREMOR WAS LOST ON THE MERCILESS PROSECUTOR
3851-9210-0107 VERY WELL THE REVOLUTIONARY OFFICIAL WENT ON RECEIVE HIM BUT DO NOT LET HIM STAY UNDER YOUR ROOF AFTER SEVEN O'CLOCK TO MORROW MORNING FOR TO MORROW AS SOON AS IT IS LIGHT I SHALL COME WITH A DENUNCIATION THAT I WILL HAVE MADE OUT AND
3851-9210-0108 SHE LOOKED AT HIM AND THE DULL MISERY IN HER EYES WOULD HAVE SOFTENED A TIGER I WILL MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE DENUNCIATION WAS FALSE BY MAKING A THOROUGH SEARCH HE WENT ON IN A GENTLE VOICE
3851-9210-0109 MY REPORT SHALL BE SUCH THAT YOU WILL BE SAFE FROM ANY SUBSEQUENT SUSPICION I SHALL MAKE MENTION OF YOUR PATRIOTIC GIFTS YOUR CIVISM AND ALL OF US WILL BE SAFE
3851-9210-0110 HER TONGUE FROZEN A KNOCK AT THE DOOR RANG THROUGH THE HOUSE OH CRIED THE TERRIFIED MOTHER FALLING UPON HER KNEES SAVE HIM SAVE HIM YES LET US SAVE HIM
3851-9210-0111 RETURNED THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR AND HIS EYES GREW BRIGHT AS HE LOOKED AT HER IF IT COSTS US OUR LIVES LOST SHE WAILED THE PROSECUTOR RAISED HER POLITELY
3851-9210-0112 THE PROSECUTOR ASKED KINDLY AS IF HE TOO WERE IN THE SECRET OF THE HOUSEHOLD A CONSCRIPT THAT THE MAYOR HAS SENT HERE FOR A NIGHT'S LODGING THE WOMAN REPLIED HOLDING OUT THE BILLET SO IT IS SAID THE PROSECUTOR WHEN HE HAD READ THE SLIP OF PAPER
3851-9210-0113 A BATTALION IS COMING HERE TO NIGHT AND HE WENT THE COUNTESS'S NEED TO BELIEVE IN THE FAITH OF HER SOMETIME ATTORNEY WAS SO GREAT THAT SHE DARED NOT ENTERTAIN ANY SUSPICION OF HIM SHE FLED UPSTAIRS
3851-9210-0114 SHE FELT SCARCELY STRENGTH ENOUGH TO STAND SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND SPRANG HALF DEAD WITH FEAR INTO HER SON'S ARMS OH MY CHILD MY CHILD SHE SOBBED COVERING HIM WITH ALMOST FRENZIED KISSES MADAME SAID A STRANGER'S VOICE OH
3851-9210-0115 IT IS NOT HE SHE CRIED SHRINKING AWAY IN TERROR AND SHE STOOD FACE TO FACE WITH THE CONSCRIPT GAZING AT HIM WITH HAGGARD EYES O SAINT BON DIEU HOW LIKE HE IS CRIED BRIGITTE THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT
3851-9210-0116 AH MONSIEUR SHE SAID LEANING ON THE ARM OF BRIGITTE'S HUSBAND FEELING FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FULL EXTENT OF A SORROW THAT HAD ALL BUT KILLED HER AT ITS FIRST THREATENING AH MONSIEUR I CANNOT STAY TO SEE YOU ANY LONGER
3851-9210-0117 PERMIT MY SERVANTS TO SUPPLY MY PLACE
3851-9210-0118 SHE WENT DOWN TO HER OWN ROOM BRIGITTE AND THE OLD SERVING MAN HALF CARRYING HER BETWEEN THEM THE HOUSEKEEPER SET HER MISTRESS IN A CHAIR AND BROKE OUT WHAT MADAME IS THAT MAN TO SLEEP IN MONSIEUR AUGUSTE'S BED
3851-9210-0119 I SHALL GO INTO THE CONSERVATORY I SHALL HEAR BETTER THERE IF ANYONE PASSES IN THE NIGHT SHE STILL WAVERED BETWEEN THE FEAR THAT SHE HAD LOST HER SON AND THE HOPE OF SEEING HIM ONCE MORE THAT NIGHT WAS HIDEOUSLY SILENT
3851-9210-0120 ONCE FOR THE COUNTESS THERE WAS AN AWFUL INTERVAL WHEN THE BATTALION OF CONSCRIPTS ENTERED THE TOWN AND THE MEN WENT BY ONE BY ONE TO THEIR LODGINGS EVERY FOOTFALL EVERY SOUND IN THE STREET RAISED HOPES TO BE DISAPPOINTED
3851-9210-0121 BUT IT WAS NOT FOR LONG THE DREADFUL QUIET SUCCEEDED AGAIN TOWARD MORNING THE COUNTESS WAS FORCED TO RETURN TO HER ROOM
3851-9210-0122 EVER KEEPING WATCH OVER HER MISTRESS'S MOVEMENTS DID NOT SEE HER COME OUT AGAIN AND WHEN SHE WENT SHE FOUND THE COUNTESS LYING THERE DEAD I EXPECT SHE HEARD THAT CONSCRIPT CRIED BRIGITTE WALKING ABOUT MONSIEUR AUGUSTE'S ROOM
3851-9210-0123 AS IF HE HAD BEEN IN A STABLE THAT MUST HAVE KILLED HER
3851-9210-0124 AND DOUBTLESS SOME DREADFUL VISION
3851-9210-0125 FOR AT THE VERY HOUR WHEN SHE DIED AT CARENTAN HER SON WAS SHOT IN LE MORBIHAN THIS TRAGICAL STORY MAY BE ADDED TO ALL THE INSTANCES ON RECORD OF THE WORKINGS OF SYMPATHIES UNCONTROLLED BY THE LAWS OF TIME AND SPACE
