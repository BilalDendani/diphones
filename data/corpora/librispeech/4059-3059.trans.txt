4059-3059-0002 IN THIS CHAPTER WHICH IS THE LONGEST THE BARON MORALISES UPON THE VIRTUE OF VERACITY
4059-3059-0003 INDUCED ME TO PAY A VISIT TO MOUNT ETNA MY VOYAGE TO THIS PLACE WAS NOT ATTENDED WITH ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WORTH RELATING ONE MORNING EARLY THREE OR FOUR DAYS AFTER MY ARRIVAL I SET OUT FROM A COTTAGE WHERE I HAD SLEPT WITHIN SIX MILES OF THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN
4059-3059-0004 DETERMINED TO EXPLORE THE INTERNAL PARTS IF I PERISHED IN THE ATTEMPT AFTER THREE HOURS HARD LABOUR I FOUND MYSELF AT THE TOP IT WAS THEN AND HAD BEEN FOR UPWARDS OF THREE WEEKS RAGING
4059-3059-0005 ITS APPEARANCE IN THIS STATE HAS BEEN SO FREQUENTLY NOTICED BY DIFFERENT TRAVELLERS THAT I WILL NOT TIRE YOU WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF OBJECTS YOU ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH I WALKED ROUND THE EDGE OF THE CRATER WHICH APPEARED TO BE FIFTY TIMES AT LEAST AS CAPACIOUS AS THE DEVIL'S PUNCH BOWL NEAR
4059-3059-0006 PETERSFIELD ON THE PORTSMOUTH ROAD BUT NOT SO BROAD AT THE BOTTOM AS IN THAT PART IT RESEMBLES THE CONTRACTED PART OF A FUNNEL MORE THAN A PUNCH BOWL AT LAST HAVING MADE UP MY MIND IN I SPRANG FEET FOREMOST
4059-3059-0007 I SOON FOUND MYSELF IN A WARM BERTH AND MY BODY BRUISED AND BURNT IN VARIOUS PARTS BY THE RED HOT CINDERS WHICH BY THEIR VIOLENT ASCENT OPPOSED MY DESCENT
4059-3059-0008 HOWEVER MY WEIGHT SOON BROUGHT ME TO THE BOTTOM WHERE I FOUND MYSELF IN THE MIDST OF NOISE AND CLAMOUR MIXED WITH THE MOST HORRID IMPRECATIONS AFTER RECOVERING MY SENSES AND FEELING A REDUCTION OF MY PAIN
4059-3059-0009 GUESS GENTLEMEN MY ASTONISHMENT WHEN I FOUND MYSELF IN THE COMPANY OF VULCAN AND HIS CYCLOPS WHO HAD BEEN QUARRELLING FOR THE THREE WEEKS BEFORE MENTIONED ABOUT THE OBSERVATION OF GOOD ORDER AND DUE SUBORDINATION
4059-3059-0010 AND WHICH HAD OCCASIONED SUCH ALARMS FOR THAT SPACE OF TIME IN THE WORLD ABOVE HOWEVER MY ARRIVAL RESTORED PEACE TO THE WHOLE SOCIETY AND VULCAN HIMSELF DID ME THE HONOUR OF APPLYING PLASTERS TO MY WOUNDS WHICH HEALED THEM IMMEDIATELY
4059-3059-0011 HE ALSO PLACED REFRESHMENTS BEFORE ME PARTICULARLY NECTAR AND OTHER RICH WINES SUCH AS THE GODS AND GODDESSES ONLY ASPIRE TO AFTER THIS REPAST WAS OVER VULCAN ORDERED VENUS TO SHOW ME EVERY INDULGENCE WHICH MY SITUATION REQUIRED
4059-3059-0012 TO DESCRIBE THE APARTMENT AND THE COUCH ON WHICH I REPOSED IS TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE THEREFORE I WILL NOT ATTEMPT IT LET IT SUFFICE TO SAY IT EXCEEDS THE POWER OF LANGUAGE TO DO IT JUSTICE
4059-3059-0013 OR SPEAK OF THAT KIND HEARTED GODDESS IN ANY TERMS EQUAL TO HER MERIT VULCAN GAVE ME A VERY CONCISE ACCOUNT OF MOUNT ETNA
4059-3059-0014 IN HIS PASSION HE MADE IT A PRACTICE TO THROW RED HOT COALS AT HOME WHICH THEY OFTEN PARRIED WITH GREAT DEXTERITY AND THEN THREW THEM UP INTO THE WORLD TO PLACE THEM OUT OF HIS REACH FOR THEY NEVER ATTEMPTED TO ASSAULT HIM IN RETURN BY THROWING THEM BACK AGAIN OUR QUARRELS
4059-3059-0015 ADDED HE LAST SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AND THESE APPEARANCES OF COALS OR CINDERS IN THE WORLD ARE WHAT I FIND YOU MORTALS CALL ERUPTIONS MOUNT VESUVIUS HE ASSURED ME WAS ANOTHER OF HIS SHOPS TO WHICH HE HAD A PASSAGE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY LEAGUES UNDER THE BED OF THE SEA
4059-3059-0016 WHERE SIMILAR QUARRELS PRODUCED SIMILAR ERUPTIONS I SHOULD HAVE CONTINUED HERE AS AN HUMBLE ATTENDANT UPON MADAM VENUS BUT SOME BUSY TATTLERS WHO DELIGHT IN MISCHIEF WHISPERED A TALE IN VULCAN'S EAR WHICH ROUSED IN HIM A FIT OF JEALOUSY NOT TO BE APPEASED
4059-3059-0017 WITHOUT THE LEAST PREVIOUS NOTICE HE TOOK ME ONE MORNING UNDER HIS ARM AS I WAS WAITING UPON VENUS AGREEABLE TO CUSTOM AND CARRIED ME TO AN APARTMENT I HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN IN WHICH THERE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCE A WELL WITH A WIDE MOUTH
4059-3059-0018 OVER THIS HE HELD ME AT ARM'S LENGTH AND SAYING UNGRATEFUL MORTAL RETURN TO THE WORLD FROM WHENCE YOU CAME WITHOUT GIVING ME THE LEAST OPPORTUNITY OF REPLY DROPPED ME IN THE CENTRE
4059-3059-0019 I FOUND MYSELF DESCENDING WITH AN INCREASING RAPIDITY TILL THE HORROR OF MY MIND DEPRIVED ME OF ALL REFLECTION I SUPPOSE I FELL INTO A TRANCE FROM WHICH I WAS SUDDENLY AROUSED BY PLUNGING INTO A LARGE BODY OF WATER
4059-3059-0020 ILLUMINATED BY THE RAYS OF THE SUN I COULD FROM MY INFANCY SWIM WELL AND PLAY TRICKS IN THE WATER I NOW FOUND MYSELF IN PARADISE CONSIDERING THE HORRORS OF MIND I HAD JUST BEEN RELEASED FROM
4059-3059-0021 AFTER LOOKING ABOUT ME SOME TIME I COULD DISCOVER NOTHING BUT AN EXPANSE OF SEA EXTENDING BEYOND THE EYE IN EVERY DIRECTION I ALSO FOUND IT VERY COLD A DIFFERENT CLIMATE FROM MASTER VULCAN'S SHOP
4059-3059-0022 AT LAST I OBSERVED AT SOME DISTANCE A BODY OF AMAZING MAGNITUDE LIKE A HUGE ROCK APPROACHING ME I SOON DISCOVERED IT TO BE A PIECE OF FLOATING ICE I SWAM ROUND IT TILL I FOUND A PLACE WHERE I COULD ASCEND TO THE TOP WHICH I DID BUT NOT WITHOUT SOME DIFFICULTY
4059-3059-0023 STILL I WAS OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND AND DESPAIR RETURNED WITH DOUBLE FORCE HOWEVER BEFORE NIGHT CAME ON I SAW A SAIL WHICH WE APPROACHED VERY FAST WHEN IT WAS WITHIN A VERY SMALL DISTANCE I HAILED THEM IN GERMAN THEY ANSWERED IN DUTCH
4059-3059-0024 I THEN FLUNG MYSELF INTO THE SEA AND THEY THREW OUT A ROPE BY WHICH I WAS TAKEN ON BOARD I NOW INQUIRED WHERE WE WERE AND WAS INFORMED IN THE GREAT SOUTHERN OCEAN THIS OPENED A DISCOVERY WHICH REMOVED ALL MY DOUBTS AND DIFFICULTIES
4059-3059-0025 IT WAS NOW EVIDENT THAT I HAD PASSED FROM MOUNT ETNA THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH TO THE SOUTH SEAS THIS GENTLEMEN WAS A MUCH SHORTER CUT THAN GOING ROUND THE WORLD AND WHICH NO MAN HAS ACCOMPLISHED OR EVER ATTEMPTED BUT MYSELF
4059-3059-0026 I TOOK SOME REFRESHMENT AND WENT TO REST THE DUTCH ARE A VERY RUDE SORT OF PEOPLE I RELATED THE ETNA PASSAGE TO THE OFFICERS EXACTLY AS I HAVE DONE TO YOU AND SOME OF THEM PARTICULARLY THE CAPTAIN SEEMED BY HIS GRIMACE AND HALF SENTENCE TO DOUBT MY VERACITY
4059-3059-0027 HOWEVER AS HE HAD KINDLY TAKEN ME ON BOARD HIS VESSEL AND WAS THEN IN THE VERY ACT OF ADMINISTERING TO MY NECESSITIES I POCKETED THE AFFRONT I NOW IN MY TURN BEGAN TO INQUIRE WHERE THEY WERE BOUND TO WHICH THEY ANSWERED THEY WERE IN SEARCH OF NEW DISCOVERIES
4059-3059-0028 WE WERE NOW EXACTLY IN CAPTAIN COOK'S FIRST TRACK AND ARRIVED THE NEXT MORNING IN BOTANY BAY THIS PLACE I WOULD BY NO MEANS RECOMMEND TO THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT AS A RECEPTACLE FOR FELONS OR PLACE OF PUNISHMENT
4059-3059-0029 IT SHOULD RATHER BE THE REWARD OF MERIT NATURE HAVING MOST BOUNTIFULLY BESTOWED HER BEST GIFTS UPON IT WE STAYED HERE BUT THREE DAYS THE FOURTH AFTER OUR DEPARTURE A MOST DREADFUL STORM AROSE WHICH IN A FEW HOURS DESTROYED ALL OUR SAILS SPLINTERED OUR BOWSPRIT
4059-3059-0030 AND BROUGHT DOWN OUR TOPMAST IT FELL DIRECTLY UPON THE BOX THAT ENCLOSED OUR COMPASS WHICH WITH THE COMPASS WAS BROKEN TO PIECES EVERY ONE WHO HAS BEEN AT SEA KNOWS THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A MISFORTUNE
4059-3059-0031 AT A LOSS WHERE TO STEER AT LENGTH THE STORM ABATED WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY A STEADY BRISK GALE THAT CARRIED US AT LEAST FORTY KNOTS AN HOUR FOR SIX MONTHS WE SHOULD SUPPOSE THE BARON HAS MADE A LITTLE MISTAKE AND SUBSTITUTED MONTHS FOR DAYS
4059-3059-0032 WHEN WE BEGAN TO OBSERVE AN AMAZING CHANGE IN EVERYTHING ABOUT US OUR SPIRITS BECAME LIGHT OUR NOSES WERE REGALED WITH THE MOST AROMATIC EFFLUVIA IMAGINABLE THE SEA HAD ALSO CHANGED ITS COMPLEXION AND FROM GREEN BECAME WHITE
4059-3059-0033 SOON AFTER THESE WONDERFUL ALTERATIONS WE SAW LAND
4059-3059-0034 AND FOUND IT WIDE AND DEEP FLOWING WITH MILK OF THE MOST DELICIOUS TASTE HERE WE LANDED AND SOON FOUND IT WAS AN ISLAND CONSISTING OF ONE LARGE CHEESE WE DISCOVERED THIS BY ONE OF THE COMPANY FAINTING AWAY AS SOON AS WE LANDED
4059-3059-0035 THIS MAN ALWAYS HAD AN AVERSION TO CHEESE WHEN HE RECOVERED HE DESIRED THE CHEESE TO BE TAKEN FROM UNDER HIS FEET UPON EXAMINATION WE FOUND HIM PERFECTLY RIGHT FOR THE WHOLE ISLAND AS BEFORE OBSERVED WAS NOTHING BUT A CHEESE OF IMMENSE MAGNITUDE
4059-3059-0036 UPON THIS THE INHABITANTS WHO ARE AMAZINGLY NUMEROUS PRINCIPALLY SUSTAIN THEMSELVES
4059-3059-0037 WHICH UPON BEING PRESSED YIELDED NOTHING BUT MILK WE SAW THE INHABITANTS RUNNING RACES UPON THE SURFACE OF THE MILK THEY WERE UPRIGHT COMELY FIGURES NINE FEET HIGH HAVE THREE LEGS AND BUT ONE ARM UPON THE WHOLE THEIR FORM WAS GRACEFUL
4059-3059-0038 THEY DID NOT SINK AT ALL BUT RAN AND WALKED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE MILK AS WE DO UPON A BOWLING GREEN UPON THIS ISLAND OF CHEESE GROWS GREAT PLENTY OF CORN THE EARS OF WHICH PRODUCE LOAVES OF BREAD READY MADE OF A ROUND FORM LIKE MUSHROOMS
4059-3059-0039 WE DISCOVERED IN OUR RAMBLES OVER THIS CHEESE SEVENTEEN OTHER RIVERS OF MILK AND TEN OF WINE
4059-3059-0040 HERE WE FOUND SOME BLUE MOULD AS CHEESE EATERS CALL IT FROM WHENCE SPRING ALL KINDS OF RICH FRUIT INSTEAD OF BREEDING MITES IT PRODUCED PEACHES NECTARINES APRICOTS AND A THOUSAND DELICIOUS FRUITS WHICH WE ARE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH
4059-3059-0041 IN THESE TREES WHICH ARE OF AN AMAZING SIZE WERE PLENTY OF BIRDS NESTS
4059-3059-0042 IT WAS AT LEAST TWICE THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S CHURCH IN LONDON UPON INSPECTION THIS NEST WAS MADE OF HUGE TREES CURIOUSLY JOINED TOGETHER THERE WERE LET ME SEE FOR I MAKE IT A RULE ALWAYS TO SPEAK WITHIN COMPASS
4059-3059-0043 THERE WERE UPWARDS OF FIVE HUNDRED EGGS IN THE NEST AND EACH OF THEM WAS AS LARGE AS FOUR COMMON HOGSHEADS OR EIGHT BARRELS AND WE COULD NOT ONLY SEE BUT HEAR THE YOUNG ONES CHIRPING WITHIN HAVING WITH GREAT FATIGUE CUT OPEN ONE OF THESE EGGS
4059-3059-0044 WE LET OUT A YOUNG ONE UNFEATHERED CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN TWENTY FULL GROWN VULTURES JUST AS WE HAD GIVEN THIS YOUNGSTER HIS LIBERTY THE OLD KINGFISHER LIGHTED AND SEIZING OUR CAPTAIN WHO HAD BEEN ACTIVE IN BREAKING THE EGG IN ONE OF HER CLAWS
4059-3059-0045 FLEW WITH HIM ABOVE A MILE HIGH AND THEN LET HIM DROP INTO THE SEA BUT NOT TILL SHE HAD BEATEN ALL HIS TEETH OUT OF HIS MOUTH WITH HER WINGS DUTCHMEN GENERALLY SWIM WELL HE SOON JOINED US AND WE RETREATED TO OUR SHIP
4059-3059-0046 ON OUR RETURN WE TOOK A DIFFERENT ROUTE AND OBSERVED MANY STRANGE OBJECTS WE SHOT TWO WILD OXEN EACH WITH ONE HORN ALSO LIKE THE INHABITANTS EXCEPT THAT IT SPROUTED FROM BETWEEN THE EYES OF THESE ANIMALS
4059-3059-0047 WE WERE AFTERWARDS CONCERNED AT HAVING DESTROYED THEM AS WE FOUND BY INQUIRY THEY TAMED THESE CREATURES AND USED THEM AS WE DO HORSES TO RIDE UPON AND DRAW THEIR CARRIAGES
4059-3059-0048 BUT USELESS WHERE PEOPLE LIVE UPON CHEESE AND MILK WHEN WE HAD REACHED WITHIN TWO DAYS JOURNEY OF THE SHIP WE OBSERVED THREE MEN HANGING TO A TALL TREE BY THEIR HEELS
