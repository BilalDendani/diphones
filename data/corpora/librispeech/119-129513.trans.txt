119-129513-0000 DURING THE WAR OF THE REBELLION A NEW AND INFLUENTIAL CLUB WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE CITY OF BALTIMORE IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND IT IS WELL KNOWN WITH WHAT ENERGY THE TASTE FOR MILITARY MATTERS BECAME DEVELOPED
119-129513-0001 SHOPKEEPERS AND MECHANICS SIMPLE TRADESMEN JUMPED THEIR COUNTERS TO BECOME EXTEMPORIZED CAPTAINS COLONELS AND GENERALS WITHOUT HAVING EVER PASSED THE SCHOOL OF INSTRUCTION AT WEST POINT NEVERTHELESS
119-129513-0002 THEY QUICKLY RIVALED THEIR COMPEERS OF THE OLD CONTINENT AND LIKE THEM CARRIED OFF VICTORIES BY DINT OF LAVISH EXPENDITURE IN AMMUNITION MONEY AND MEN
119-129513-0003 BUT THE POINT IN WHICH THE AMERICANS SINGULARLY DISTANCED THE EUROPEANS WAS IN THE SCIENCE OF GUNNERY NOT INDEED THAT THEIR WEAPONS RETAINED A HIGHER DEGREE OF PERFECTION THAN THEIRS
119-129513-0004 BUT THAT THEY EXHIBITED UNHEARD OF DIMENSIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY ATTAINED HITHERTO UNHEARD OF RANGES IN POINT OF GRAZING PLUNGING OBLIQUE OR ENFILADING OR POINT BLANK FIRING THE ENGLISH
119-129513-0005 FRENCH AND PRUSSIANS HAVE NOTHING TO LEARN BUT THEIR CANNON HOWITZERS AND MORTARS ARE MERE POCKET PISTOLS
119-129513-0006 THIS FACT NEED SURPRISE NO ONE THE YANKEES THE FIRST MECHANICIANS IN THE WORLD ARE ENGINEERS JUST AS THE ITALIANS ARE MUSICIANS AND THE GERMANS METAPHYSICIANS BY RIGHT OF BIRTH NOTHING IS MORE NATURAL
119-129513-0007 THEREFORE THAN TO PERCEIVE THEM APPLYING THEIR AUDACIOUS INGENUITY TO THE SCIENCE OF GUNNERY WITNESS THE MARVELS OF PARROTT DAHLGREN AND RODMAN THE ARMSTRONG PALLISER
119-129513-0008 GUNS WERE COMPELLED TO BOW BEFORE THEIR TRANSATLANTIC RIVALS NOW WHEN AN AMERICAN HAS AN IDEA HE DIRECTLY SEEKS A SECOND AMERICAN TO SHARE IT
119-129513-0009 THEY ELECT A PRESIDENT AND TWO SECRETARIES GIVEN FOUR THEY NAME A KEEPER OF RECORDS AND THE OFFICE IS READY FOR WORK FIVE THEY CONVENE A GENERAL MEETING AND THE CLUB IS FULLY CONSTITUTED SO THINGS WERE MANAGED IN BALTIMORE
119-129513-0010 THE INVENTOR OF A NEW CANNON ASSOCIATED HIMSELF WITH THE CASTER AND THE BORER THUS WAS FORMED THE NUCLEUS OF THE GUN CLUB IN A SINGLE MONTH AFTER ITS FORMATION IT NUMBERED ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY THREE EFFECTIVE MEMBERS
119-129513-0011 AND THIRTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE CORRESPONDING MEMBERS ONE CONDITION WAS IMPOSED
119-129513-0012 OR MORE OR LESS PERFECTED A CANNON OR IN DEFAULT OF A CANNON AT LEAST A FIREARM OF SOME DESCRIPTION IT MAY HOWEVER BE MENTIONED THAT MERE INVENTORS OF REVOLVERS FIRE SHOOTING
119-129513-0013 AND SIMILAR SMALL ARMS MET WITH LITTLE CONSIDERATION
119-129513-0014 THE ESTIMATION IN WHICH THESE GENTLEMEN WERE HELD ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE MOST SCIENTIFIC EXPONENTS OF THE GUN CLUB WAS PROPORTIONAL TO THE MASSES OF THEIR GUNS
119-129513-0015 AND THEIR PROJECTILES EXCEEDING THE PRESCRIBED LIMITS UNFORTUNATELY OCCASIONALLY CUT IN TWO SOME UNOFFENDING PEDESTRIANS THESE INVENTIONS IN FACT LEFT FAR IN THE REAR THE TIMID INSTRUMENTS OF EUROPEAN ARTILLERY
119-129513-0016 IT IS BUT FAIR TO ADD THAT THESE YANKEES BRAVE AS THEY HAVE EVER PROVED THEMSELVES TO BE DID NOT CONFINE THEMSELVES TO THEORIES AND FORMULAE BUT THAT THEY PAID HEAVILY IN PROPRIA PERSONA FOR THEIR INVENTIONS AMONG THEM
119-129513-0017 WERE TO BE COUNTED OFFICERS OF ALL RANKS FROM LIEUTENANTS TO GENERALS MILITARY MEN OF EVERY AGE FROM THOSE WHO WERE JUST MAKING THEIR DEBUT IN THE PROFESSION OF ARMS UP TO THOSE WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN THE GUN CARRIAGE MANY HAD FOUND
119-129513-0018 THEIR REST ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE WHOSE NAMES FIGURED IN THE BOOK OF HONOR OF THE GUN CLUB AND OF THOSE WHO MADE GOOD THEIR RETURN THE GREATER PROPORTION BORE THE MARKS OF THEIR INDISPUTABLE VALOR CRUTCHES WOODEN LEGS ARTIFICIAL ARMS
119-129513-0019 STEEL HOOKS CAOUTCHOUC JAWS SILVER CRANIUMS PLATINUM NOSES
119-129513-0020 OF THESE LITTLE FACTS AND FELT JUSTLY PROUD WHEN THE DESPATCHES OF A BATTLE RETURNED THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS AT TEN FOLD THE QUANTITY OF PROJECTILES EXPENDED ONE DAY HOWEVER SAD AND MELANCHOLY DAY PEACE WAS SIGNED BETWEEN THE SURVIVORS OF THE WAR
119-129513-0021 TOGETHER WITH GRIEF AND THE GUN CLUB WAS RELEGATED TO PROFOUND INACTIVITY SOME FEW OF THE MORE ADVANCED AND INVETERATE THEORISTS SET THEMSELVES AGAIN TO WORK UPON CALCULATIONS REGARDING THE LAWS OF PROJECTILES THEY REVERTED INVARIABLY
119-129513-0022 THE NEWSPAPERS GREW MOULDY ON THE TABLES SOUNDS OF SNORING CAME FROM DARK CORNERS AND THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB
119-129513-0023 WERE REDUCED TO SILENCE BY THIS DISASTROUS PEACE AND GAVE THEMSELVES UP WHOLLY TO DREAMS OF A PLATONIC KIND OF ARTILLERY THIS IS HORRIBLE SAID TOM HUNTER ONE EVENING WHILE RAPIDLY CARBONIZING HIS WOODEN LEGS IN THE FIREPLACE OF THE SMOKING ROOM
119-129513-0024 NOTHING TO DO NOTHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT A LOATHSOME EXISTENCE WHEN AGAIN SHALL THE GUNS AROUSE US IN THE MORNING WITH THEIR DELIGHTFUL REPORTS
119-129513-0025 IT WAS DELIGHTFUL ONCE UPON A TIME ONE INVENTED A GUN AND HARDLY WAS IT CAST WHEN ONE HASTENED TO TRY IT IN THE FACE OF THE ENEMY THEN ONE RETURNED TO CAMP WITH A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT FROM SHERMAN OR A FRIENDLY SHAKE OF THE HAND FROM MC CLELLAN BUT NOW THE GENERALS ARE GONE BACK TO THEIR COUNTERS
119-129513-0026 THE FUTURE OF GUNNERY IN AMERICA IS LOST AY AND NO WAR IN PROSPECT CONTINUED THE FAMOUS JAMES T MASTON SCRATCHING WITH HIS STEEL HOOK HIS GUTTA PERCHA CRANIUM NOT A CLOUD ON THE HORIZON AND THAT TOO

119-129513-0034 SHALL WE NOT EMPLOY THESE REMAINING YEARS OF OUR LIFE IN PERFECTING FIREARMS SHALL THERE NEVER BE A FRESH OPPORTUNITY OF TRYING THE RANGES OF PROJECTILES SHALL THE AIR NEVER AGAIN BE LIGHTED WITH THE GLARE OF OUR GUNS NO INTERNATIONAL DIFFICULTY EVER ARISE
119-129513-0035 HANG A FEW OF OUR COUNTRYMEN NO SUCH LUCK REPLIED COLONEL BLOMSBERRY NOTHING OF THE KIND IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN AND EVEN IF IT DID WE SHOULD NOT PROFIT BY IT AMERICAN SUSCEPTIBILITY IS FAST DECLINING AND WE ARE ALL GOING TO THE DOGS
119-129513-0036 IT IS TOO TRUE REPLIED J T MASTON WITH FRESH VIOLENCE THERE ARE A THOUSAND GROUNDS FOR FIGHTING AND YET WE DON'T FIGHT WE SAVE UP OUR ARMS AND LEGS FOR THE BENEFIT OF NATIONS
119-129513-0037 IT WOULD BE BUT JUST AND FAIR RETURNED COLONEL BLOMSBERRY
