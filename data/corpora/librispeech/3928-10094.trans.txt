3928-10094-0000 AND EVEN AFTER DEATH KEPT ALIVE IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD BY THE TESTIMONY OF STATUES TOMBS MEDALS AND OTHER MEMORIALS OF THAT KIND NONE THE LESS IT IS CLEARLY SEEN THAT THE RAVENING MAW OF TIME
3928-10094-0001 HAS NOT ONLY DIMINISHED BY A GREAT AMOUNT THEIR OWN WORKS AND THE HONOURABLE TESTIMONIES OF OTHERS BUT HAS ALSO BLOTTED OUT AND DESTROYED THE NAMES OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN KEPT ALIVE BY ANY OTHER MEANS THAN BY THE RIGHT VIVACIOUS
3928-10094-0002 AND PIOUS PENS OF WRITERS PONDERING OVER THIS MATTER MANY A TIME IN MY OWN MIND AND RECOGNIZING FROM THE EXAMPLE NOT ONLY OF THE ANCIENTS BUT OF THE MODERNS AS WELL
3928-10094-0003 AND FINALLY HAVING RECEIVED FROM THIS BOTH PROFIT AND PLEASURE I HAVE JUDGED IT EXPEDIENT NAY RATHER MY DUTY TO MAKE FOR THEM WHATSOEVER MEMORIAL MY WEAK TALENTS AND MY SMALL JUDGMENT MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE IN HONOUR THEN
3928-10094-0004 AND FOR THE BENEFIT FOR THE MOST PART OF ALL THE FOLLOWERS OF THESE THREE MOST EXCELLENT ARTS ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING I WILL WRITE THE LIVES OF THE CRAFTSMEN OF EACH ACCORDING TO THE TIMES WHEREIN THEY LIVED
3928-10094-0005 NOT TOUCHING ON THE ANCIENTS SAVE IN SO FAR AS IT MAY CONCERN OUR SUBJECT
3928-10094-0006 WHO HAVE COME DOWN TO OUR OWN AGE
3928-10094-0007 OR TO THE HISTORY OF THE CRAFTSMEN IT SEEMS TO ME RIGHT TO TOUCH A LITTLE
3928-10094-0008 WITHOUT REASON AS TO THE SOVEREIGNTY AND NOBILITY NOT OF ARCHITECTURE WHICH THEY HAVE LEFT ON ONE SIDE BUT OF SCULPTURE AND PAINTING THERE BEING ADVANCED ON ONE SIDE AND ON THE OTHER
3928-10094-0009 I SAY THEN THAT THE SCULPTORS AS BEING ENDOWED PERCHANCE BY NATURE AND BY THE EXERCISE OF THEIR ART WITH A BETTER HABIT OF BODY WITH MORE BLOOD AND WITH MORE ENERGY
3928-10094-0010 FOR THE REASON THAT GOD ALMIGHTY MADE MAN WHO WAS THE FIRST STATUE AND THEY SAY THAT SCULPTURE EMBRACES MANY MORE ARTS AS KINDRED
3928-10094-0011 SUBORDINATE TO ITSELF THAN HAS PAINTING SUCH AS LOW RELIEF WORKING IN CLAY WAX PLASTER WOOD AND IVORY CASTING IN METALS
3928-10094-0012 EVERY KIND OF CHASING ENGRAVING AND CARVING IN RELIEF ON FINE STONES AND STEEL AND MANY OTHERS WHICH BOTH IN NUMBER AND IN DIFFICULTY SURPASS THOSE OF PAINTING AND ALLEGING FURTHER
3928-10094-0013 THAN IS PAINTING WHICH BY ITS VERY NATURE NOT TO SAY BY EXTERNAL ACCIDENTS PERISHES IN THE MOST SHELTERED AND MOST SECURE PLACES
3928-10094-0014 NAY MORE THEY INSIST THAT
3928-10094-0015 SAYING THAT SCULPTURE CALLS FOR A CERTAIN BETTER DISPOSITION BOTH OF MIND AND OF BODY THAT ARE RARELY FOUND TOGETHER WHEREAS PAINTING CONTENTS ITSELF WITH ANY FEEBLE TEMPERAMENT SO LONG AS IT HAS A HAND IF NOT BOLD AT LEAST SURE
3928-10094-0016 AND THAT THIS THEIR CONTENTION IS PROVED BY THE GREATER PRICES CITED IN PARTICULAR BY PLINY BY THE LOVES CAUSED BY THE MARVELLOUS BEAUTY OF CERTAIN STATUES AND BY THE JUDGMENT OF HIM WHO MADE THE STATUE OF SCULPTURE OF GOLD
3928-10094-0017 AND THAT OF PAINTING OF SILVER AND PLACED THE FIRST ON THE RIGHT AND THE SECOND ON THE LEFT NOR DO THEY EVEN REFRAIN FROM QUOTING THE DIFFICULTIES EXPERIENCED BEFORE THE MATERIALS
3928-10094-0018 SUCH AS THE MARBLES AND THE METALS CAN BE GOT INTO SUBJECTION AND THEIR VALUE IN CONTRAST TO THE EASE OF OBTAINING THE PANELS THE CANVASES
3928-10094-0019 FOR THE SMALLEST PRICES AND IN EVERY PLACE AND FURTHER THE EXTREME AND GRIEVOUS LABOUR OF HANDLING THE MARBLES AND THE BRONZES THROUGH THEIR WEIGHT
3928-10094-0020 THROUGH THE WEIGHT OF THE TOOLS IN CONTRAST TO THE LIGHTNESS OF THE BRUSHES OF THE STYLES AND OF THE PENS CHALK HOLDERS AND CHARCOALS BESIDES THIS THAT THEY EXHAUST THEIR MINDS TOGETHER WITH ALL THE PARTS OF THEIR BODIES
3928-10094-0021 WHICH IS SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS
3928-10094-0022 USING ONLY HIS MIND AND HAND MOREOVER THEY LAY VERY GREAT STRESS ON THE FACT THAT THINGS ARE MORE NOBLE AND MORE PERFECT IN PROPORTION AS THEY APPROACH MORE NEARLY TO THE TRUTH
3928-10094-0023 AND THEY SAY THAT SCULPTURE IMITATES THE TRUE FORM AND SHOWS ITS WORKS ON EVERY SIDE AND FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW WHEREAS PAINTING BEING LAID ON FLAT WITH MOST SIMPLE STROKES OF THE BRUSH AND HAVING BUT ONE LIGHT
3928-10094-0024 SHOWS BUT ONE ASPECT AND MANY OF THEM DO NOT SCRUPLE TO SAY THAT SCULPTURE IS AS MUCH SUPERIOR TO PAINTING AS IS TRUTH TO FALSEHOOD BUT AS THEIR LAST AND STRONGEST ARGUMENT
3928-10094-0025 A PERFECTION OF JUDGMENT NOT ONLY ORDINARY AS FOR THE PAINTER BUT ABSOLUTE AND IMMEDIATE IN A MANNER THAT IT MAY SEE WITHIN THE MARBLE THE EXACT WHOLE OF THAT FIGURE WHICH THEY INTEND TO CARVE FROM IT
3928-10094-0026 AND MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE MANY PARTS PERFECT WITHOUT ANY OTHER MODEL BEFORE IT COMBINES AND UNITES THEM TOGETHER AS MICHELAGNOLO
3928-10094-0027 HAS DONE DIVINELY WELL ALTHOUGH FOR LACK OF THIS HAPPINESS OF JUDGMENT THEY MAKE EASILY AND OFTEN SOME OF THOSE BLUNDERS WHICH HAVE NO REMEDY
3928-10094-0028 OR TO THE SMALL JUDGMENT OF THE SCULPTOR THIS NEVER HAPPENS TO PAINTERS FOR THE REASON THAT AT EVERY SLIP OF THE BRUSH
3928-10094-0029 OR BEING TOLD BY OTHERS TO COVER AND PATCH IT UP WITH THE VERY BRUSH THAT MADE IT
3928-10094-0030 THAT IT NOT ONLY HEALS AS DID THE IRON OF THE SPEAR OF ACHILLES BUT LEAVES ITS WOUNDS WITHOUT A SCAR
3928-10094-0031 SAY IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IF THE SCULPTORS WISH TO DISCUSS THE MATTER ON THE GROUND OF THE SCRIPTURES THE CHIEF NOBILITY IS THEIR OWN AND THAT THE SCULPTORS DECEIVE THEMSELVES VERY GRIEVOUSLY
3928-10094-0032 AND THEY SAY THAT IF WE CONSIDER IT APART FROM THE SCRIPTURES THE OPINIONS OF THE AGES ARE SO MANY AND SO VARIED THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE ONE MORE THAN THE OTHER AND THAT FINALLY CONSIDERING THIS NOBILITY
3928-10094-0033 THAT THEY HAVE MANY MORE THAN THE SCULPTORS BECAUSE PAINTING EMBRACES THE INVENTION OF HISTORY THE MOST DIFFICULT ART OF FORESHORTENING ALL THE BRANCHES OF ARCHITECTURE NEEDFUL FOR THE MAKING OF BUILDINGS PERSPECTIVE COLOURING IN DISTEMPER
3928-10094-0034 AND THE ART OF WORKING IN FRESCO AN ART DIFFERENT AND DISTINCT FROM ALL THE OTHERS LIKEWISE WORKING IN OILS ON WOOD ON STONE AND ON CANVAS ILLUMINATION TOO AN ART DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE OTHERS
3928-10094-0035 WEAVING BROCADES WITH FIGURES AND FLOWERS AND THAT MOST BEAUTIFUL INVENTION WOVEN TAPESTRIES THAT ARE BOTH CONVENIENT AND MAGNIFICENT BEING ABLE TO CARRY PAINTING INTO EVERY PLACE WHETHER SAVAGE OR CIVILIZED
3928-10094-0036 NOT TO MENTION THAT IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF ART THAT HAS TO BE PRACTISED DESIGN WHICH IS OUR DESIGN IS USED BY ALL SO THAT THE MEMBERS OF PAINTING ARE MORE NUMEROUS AND MORE USEFUL THAN THOSE OF SCULPTURE THEY DO NOT
3928-10094-0037 DENY THE ETERNITY FOR SO THE OTHERS CALL IT OF SCULPTURE BUT THEY SAY THAT THIS IS NO PRIVILEGE THAT SHOULD MAKE THE ART MORE NOBLE THAN IT IS BY NATURE SEEING THAT IT COMES SIMPLY FROM THE MATERIAL
3928-10094-0038 WOULD HAVE A SOUL MORE NOBLE BEYOND COMPARE THAN THAT OF MEN
3928-10094-0039 AND ON THE LITTLE FAVOUR OR AVARICE AS WE WOULD RATHER CALL IT OF RICH MEN WHO GIVE THEM NO SUPPLY OF MARBLE AND NO OPPORTUNITY TO WORK
3928-10094-0040 IN CONTRAST WITH WHAT MAY BE BELIEVED NAY SEEN TO HAVE HAPPENED IN ANCIENT TIMES WHEN SCULPTURE ROSE TO ITS GREATEST HEIGHT INDEED IT IS MANIFEST THAT HE WHO CANNOT USE AND WASTE
3928-10094-0041 A SMALL QUANTITY OF MARBLE AND HARD STONE WHICH ARE VERY COSTLY CANNOT HAVE THAT PRACTICE IN THE ART THAT IS ESSENTIAL HE WHO DOES NOT PRACTISE DOES NOT LEARN IT AND HE WHO DOES NOT LEARN IT CAN DO NO GOOD WHEREFORE
3928-10094-0042 AS FOR THE HIGHER PRICES OF SCULPTURES THEY ANSWER THAT ALTHOUGH THEIRS MIGHT BE MUCH LESS
3928-10094-0043 OR THEIR CHEAP STOOLS WHEREAS THE SCULPTORS BESIDES THE GREAT COST OF THEIR MATERIAL REQUIRE MANY AIDS AND SPEND MORE TIME ON ONE SINGLE FIGURE THAN THEY THEMSELVES DO ON VERY MANY
3928-10094-0044 FROM THE AIDS THAT IT REQUIRES FOR ITS COMPLETION AND FROM THE TIME THAT IS TAKEN IN WORKING IT RATHER THAN FROM THE EXCELLENCE OF THE ART ITSELF AND ALTHOUGH THAT DOES NOT SUFFICE AND NO GREATER PRICE IS FOUND
3928-10094-0045 AS WOULD BE EASILY SEEN BY ANYONE WHO WERE WILLING TO CONSIDER IT DILIGENTLY LET THEM FIND A GREATER PRICE THAN THE MARVELLOUS BEAUTIFUL
3928-10094-0046 FOR THE MOST SPLENDID AND EXCELLENT WORK OF APELLES BESTOWING ON HIM NOT VAST TREASURES OR HIGH ESTATE
3928-10094-0047 ENAMOURED OF HER AND NATURALLY SUBJECT TO THE PASSIONS OF LOVE AND ALSO BOTH A KING AND A GREEK AND THEN FROM THIS LET THEM DRAW WHAT CONCLUSION THEY PLEASE
3928-10094-0048 AS FOR THE LOVES OF PYGMALION AND OF THOSE OTHER RASCALS NO MORE WORTHY TO BE MEN CITED AS PROOF OF THE NOBILITY OF THE ART
3928-10094-0049 IF FROM A VERY GREAT BLINDNESS OF INTELLECT AND FROM A LICENTIOUSNESS UNBRIDLED BEYOND ALL NATURAL BOUNDS
3928-10094-0050 AND PAINTING OF SILVER THEY ARE AGREED THAT IF HE HAD GIVEN AS MUCH SIGN OF JUDGMENT AS OF WEALTH THERE WOULD BE NO DISPUTING IT AND FINALLY THEY CONCLUDE THAT THE ANCIENT GOLDEN FLEECE HOWEVER CELEBRATED IT MAY BE
3928-10094-0051 NONE THE LESS COVERED NOTHING BUT AN UNINTELLIGENT RAM WHEREFORE NEITHER THE TESTIMONY OF RICHES NOR THAT OF DISHONEST DESIRES BUT THOSE OF LETTERS OF PRACTICE OF EXCELLENCE AND OF JUDGMENT
3928-10094-0052 ARE THOSE TO WHICH WE MUST PAY ATTENTION NOR DO THEY MAKE ANY ANSWER TO THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING THE MARBLES AND THE METALS SAVE THIS THAT IT SPRINGS FROM THEIR OWN POVERTY AND FROM THE LITTLE FAVOUR OF THE POWERFUL AS HAS BEEN SAID
3928-10094-0053 AND NOT FROM ANY DEGREE OF GREATER NOBILITY TO THE EXTREME FATIGUES OF THE BODY AND TO THE DANGERS PECULIAR TO THEM AND TO THEIR WORKS LAUGHING AND WITHOUT ANY ADO THEY ANSWER THAT IF GREATER FATIGUES AND DANGERS PROVE GREATER NOBILITY
3928-10094-0054 THE ART OF QUARRYING THE MARBLES FROM THE BOWELS OF MOUNTAINS BY MEANS OF WEDGES
3928-10094-0055 MUST BE MORE NOBLE THAN SCULPTURE THAT OF THE BLACKSMITH MUST SURPASS THE GOLDSMITH'S AND THAT OF MASONRY MUST BE SUPERIOR TO ARCHITECTURE THEY SAY NEXT THAT THE TRUE DIFFICULTIES LIE RATHER IN THE MIND THAN IN THE BODY
3928-10094-0056 CALL FOR MORE STUDY AND KNOWLEDGE ARE MORE NOBLE AND EXCELLENT THAN THOSE THAT AVAIL THEMSELVES RATHER OF STRENGTH OF BODY AND THEY DECLARE THAT SINCE THE PAINTERS RELY MORE ON THE WORTH OF THE MIND THAN THE OTHERS THIS HIGHEST HONOUR BELONGS TO PAINTING
3928-10094-0057 FOR THE SCULPTORS THE COMPASSES AND SQUARES SUFFICE TO DISCOVER AND APPLY ALL THE PROPORTIONS AND MEASUREMENTS WHEREOF THEY HAVE NEED FOR THE PAINTERS THERE IS NECESSARY BESIDES THE KNOWLEDGE HOW TO MAKE GOOD USE OF THE AFORESAID INSTRUMENTS
3928-10094-0058 AN ACCURATE UNDERSTANDING OF PERSPECTIVE FOR THE REASON THAT THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE A THOUSAND OTHER THINGS BEYOND LANDSCAPES AND BUILDINGS NOT TO MENTION
3928-10094-0059 THAN IN A SINGLE STATUE FOR THE SCULPTOR IT IS ENOUGH TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE TRUE FORMS AND FEATURES OF SOLID AND TANGIBLE BODIES SUBORDINATE ON EVERY SIDE TO THE TOUCH
3928-10094-0060 THE FRUITS AND THE MINERALS THAN BY ANYTHING ELSE AND THIS KNOWLEDGE IS SUPREMELY DIFFICULT TO ACQUIRE
3928-10094-0061 THEY SAY MOREOVER THAT WHEREAS SCULPTURE THROUGH THE STUBBORNNESS AND THE IMPERFECTION OF THE MATERIAL DOES NOT REPRESENT THE EMOTIONS OF THE SOUL SAVE WITH MOTION WHICH DOES NOT HOWEVER FIND MUCH SCOPE THEREIN
3928-10094-0062 THEY MUST HAVE BESIDES LONG PRACTICE IN THE ART A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF PHYSIOGNOMY WHEREOF THAT PART SUFFICES FOR THE SCULPTOR WHICH DEALS WITH THE QUANTITY AND THE QUALITY OF THE MEMBERS
3928-10094-0063 WITHOUT TROUBLING ABOUT THE QUALITY OF COLOURS AS TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH ANYONE WHO JUDGES BY THE EYE KNOWS HOW USEFUL AND NECESSARY IT IS FOR THE TRUE IMITATION OF NATURE WHEREUNTO
3928-10094-0064 THE CLOSER A MAN APPROACHES THE MORE PERFECT HE IS AFTER THIS THEY ADD THAT WHEREAS SCULPTURE TAKING AWAY BIT BY BIT AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME GIVES DEPTH TO AND ACQUIRES RELIEF FOR
3928-10094-0065 AND MAKES USE OF TOUCH AND SIGHT THE PAINTERS IN TWO DISTINCT ACTIONS GIVE RELIEF AND DEPTH TO A FLAT SURFACE WITH THE HELP OF ONE SINGLE SENSE AND THIS WHEN IT HAS BEEN DONE BY A PERSON INTELLIGENT IN THE ART
3928-10094-0066 AS THE OTHERS SAY AND NOT TO BE REMEDIED SAVE BY PATCHES WHICH EVEN AS IN GARMENTS THEY ARE SIGNS OF POVERTY OF WARDROBE SO TOO BOTH IN SCULPTURE AND IN PICTURES ARE SIGNS OF POVERTY OF INTELLECT AND JUDGMENT
3928-10094-0067 THEY CONCLUDE THEN THAT THIS DIFFICULTY WHICH THEY PUT DOWN AS THE GREATER IS NOTHING OR LITTLE WHEN COMPARED TO THOSE WHICH THE PAINTERS HAVE WHEN WORKING IN FRESCO
3928-10094-0068 IT BEING SUFFICIENT FOR THE FORMER TO EXECUTE GOOD MODELS IN WAX CLAY OR SOMETHING ELSE EVEN AS THE LATTER MAKE THEIR DRAWINGS ON CORRESPONDING MATERIALS OR ON CARTOONS
3928-10094-0069 AND THAT FINALLY THE QUALITY THAT LITTLE BY LITTLE TRANSFERS THEIR MODELS TO THE MARBLE IS RATHER PATIENCE THAN AUGHT ELSE BUT LET US CONSIDER ABOUT JUDGMENT AS THE SCULPTORS WISH
3928-10094-0070 THAN TO ONE WHO CHISELS IN MARBLE
3928-10094-0071 WHICH ARE MOST MORTAL ENEMIES TO THE UNION OF THE PLASTER AND THE COLOURS BUT THE EYE DOES NOT SEE THE TRUE COLOURS UNTIL THE PLASTER IS WELL DRY NOR CAN THE HAND JUDGE OF ANYTHING BUT OF THE SOFT OR THE DRY
3928-10094-0072 IN A MANNER THAT ANYONE WHO WERE TO CALL IT WORKING IN THE DARK OR WITH SPECTACLES OF COLOURS DIFFERENT FROM THE TRUTH WOULD NOT IN MY BELIEF BE VERY FAR WRONG NAY
3928-10094-0073 I DO NOT DOUBT AT ALL THAT SUCH A NAME IS MORE SUITABLE FOR IT THAN FOR INTAGLIO FOR WHICH WAX SERVES AS SPECTACLES BOTH TRUE AND GOOD THEY SAY TOO THAT FOR THIS WORK IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE A RESOLUTE JUDGMENT
