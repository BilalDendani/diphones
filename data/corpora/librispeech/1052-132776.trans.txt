1052-132776-0000 AND HAD ADVISED HIS HIGHNESS TO APPEAR IN ENGLAND AT THE HEAD OF A STRONG BODY OF TROOPS AND TO CALL THE PEOPLE TO ARMS WILLIAM HAD SEEN AT A GLANCE THE WHOLE IMPORTANCE OF THE CRISIS
1052-132776-0001 ADMITTED THAT THE DISTEMPERS OF THE STATE WERE SUCH AS REQUIRED AN EXTRAORDINARY REMEDY BUT SPOKE WITH EARNESTNESS OF THE CHANCE OF FAILURE AND OF THE CALAMITIES WHICH FAILURE MIGHT BRING ON BRITAIN AND ON EUROPE
1052-132776-0002 HE KNEW WELL THAT MANY WHO TALKED IN HIGH LANGUAGE ABOUT SACRIFICING THEIR LIVES AND FORTUNES FOR THEIR COUNTRY WOULD HESITATE WHEN THE PROSPECT OF ANOTHER BLOODY CIRCUIT WAS BROUGHT CLOSE TO THEM HE WANTED THEREFORE TO HAVE NOT VAGUE PROFESSIONS OF GOOD WILL
1052-132776-0003 HIS PRINCIPAL COADJUTOR IN THIS WORK WAS HENRY SIDNEY BROTHER OF ALGERNON IT IS REMARKABLE THAT BOTH EDWARD RUSSELL AND HENRY SIDNEY HAD BEEN IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF JAMES THAT BOTH HAD PARTLY ON PUBLIC AND PARTLY ON PRIVATE GROUNDS BECOME HIS ENEMIES
1052-132776-0004 AND THAT BOTH HAD TO AVENGE THE BLOOD OF NEAR KINSMEN WHO HAD IN THE SAME YEAR FALLEN VICTIMS TO HIS IMPLACABLE SEVERITY HERE THE RESEMBLANCE ENDS RUSSELL WITH CONSIDERABLE ABILITIES WAS PROUD ACRIMONIOUS RESTLESS AND VIOLENT
1052-132776-0005 SIDNEY WITH A SWEET TEMPER AND WINNING MANNERS SEEMED TO BE DEFICIENT IN CAPACITY AND KNOWLEDGE AND TO BE SUNK IN VOLUPTUOUSNESS AND INDOLENCE HIS FACE AND FORM WERE EMINENTLY HANDSOME IN HIS YOUTH HE HAD BEEN THE TERROR OF HUSBANDS
1052-132776-0006 AND EVEN NOW AT NEAR FIFTY HE WAS THE FAVOURITE OF WOMEN AND THE ENVY OF YOUNGER MEN HE HAD FORMERLY RESIDED AT THE HAGUE IN A PUBLIC CHARACTER AND HAD THEN SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING A LARGE SHARE OF WILLIAM'S CONFIDENCE
1052-132776-0007 MANY WONDERED AT THIS FOR IT SEEMED THAT BETWEEN THE MOST AUSTERE OF STATESMEN
1052-132776-0008 SWIFT MANY YEARS LATER COULD NOT BE CONVINCED THAT ONE WHOM HE HAD KNOWN ONLY AS AN ILLITERATE AND FRIVOLOUS OLD RAKE COULD REALLY HAVE PLAYED A GREAT PART IN A GREAT REVOLUTION YET A LESS ACUTE OBSERVER THAN SWIFT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AWARE THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN TACT
1052-132776-0009 IT IS IN SOME SENSE AN ADVANTAGE TO HIM THAT HE IS DESTITUTE OF THOSE MORE SHOWY TALENTS WHICH WOULD MAKE HIM AN OBJECT OF ADMIRATION OF ENVY AND OF FEAR SIDNEY WAS A REMARKABLE INSTANCE OF THIS TRUTH INCAPABLE IGNORANT AND DISSIPATED AS HE SEEMED TO BE
1052-132776-0010 HE UNDERSTOOD OR RATHER FELT WITH WHOM IT WAS NECESSARY TO BE RESERVED AND WITH WHOM HE MIGHT SAFELY VENTURE TO BE COMMUNICATIVE THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT HE DID WHAT MORDAUNT WITH ALL HIS VIVACITY AND INVENTION OR BURNET
1052-132776-0011 HE WENT INTO THE SCHEME WITH HIS WHOLE HEART
1052-132776-0012 SIDNEY SOUNDED HALIFAX SHREWSBURY TOOK HIS PART WITH A COURAGE AND DECISION WHICH AT A LATER PERIOD SEEMED TO BE WANTING TO HIS CHARACTER HE AT ONCE AGREED TO SET HIS ESTATE HIS HONOURS AND HIS LIFE ON THE STAKE BUT HALIFAX RECEIVED THE FIRST HINT
1052-132776-0013 THE BROW THE EYE AND THE MOUTH OF HALIFAX INDICATED A POWERFUL INTELLECT AND AN EXQUISITE SENSE OF THE LUDICROUS BUT THE EXPRESSION WAS THAT OF A SCEPTIC OF A VOLUPTUARY OF A MAN NOT LIKELY TO VENTURE HIS ALL ON A SINGLE HAZARD
1052-132776-0014 OR TO BE A MARTYR IN ANY CAUSE TO THOSE WHO ARE ACQUAINTED WITH HIS COUNTENANCE
1052-132776-0015 HE WAS NOW FREE BUT THIS DID NOT CONTENT HIM HE WISHED TO BE AGAIN GREAT ATTACHED AS HE WAS TO THE ANGLICAN CHURCH HOSTILE AS HE WAS TO THE FRENCH ASCENDENCY HE COULD NOT HOPE TO BE GREAT IN A COURT SWARMING WITH JESUITS AND OBSEQUIOUS TO THE HOUSE OF BOURBON
1052-132776-0016 BUT IF HE BORE A CHIEF PART IN A REVOLUTION WHICH SHOULD CONFOUND ALL THE SCHEMES OF THE PAPISTS
1052-132776-0017 AND WHICH SHOULD TRANSFER THE REGAL POWER TO AN ILLUSTRIOUS PAIR WHOM HE HAD UNITED HE MIGHT EMERGE FROM HIS ECLIPSE WITH NEW SPLENDOUR THE WHIGS WHOSE ANIMOSITY HAD NINE YEARS BEFORE DRIVEN HIM FROM OFFICE WOULD
1052-132776-0018 ON HIS AUSPICIOUS REAPPEARANCE JOIN THEIR ACCLAMATIONS TO THE ACCLAMATIONS OF HIS OLD FRIENDS THE CAVALIERS
1052-132776-0019 THE EARL OF DEVONSHIRE THE TWO NOBLEMEN HAD MET AT A VILLAGE IN THE PEAK AND HAD EXCHANGED ASSURANCES OF GOOD WILL DEVONSHIRE HAD FRANKLY OWNED THAT THE WHIGS HAD BEEN GUILTY OF A GREAT INJUSTICE AND HAD DECLARED THAT THEY WERE NOW CONVINCED OF THEIR ERROR
1052-132776-0020 DANBY ON HIS SIDE HAD ALSO RECANTATIONS TO MAKE HE HAD ONCE HELD OR PRETENDED TO HOLD THE DOCTRINE OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE IN THE LARGEST SENSE UNDER HIS ADMINISTRATION AND WITH HIS SANCTION A LAW HAD BEEN PROPOSED WHICH IF IT HAD BEEN PASSED
1052-132776-0021 WOULD HAVE EXCLUDED FROM PARLIAMENT AND OFFICE ALL WHO REFUSED TO DECLARE ON OATH THAT THEY THOUGHT RESISTANCE IN EVERY CASE UNLAWFUL BUT HIS VIGOROUS UNDERSTANDING NOW THOROUGHLY AWAKENED BY ANXIETY FOR THE PUBLIC INTERESTS AND FOR HIS OWN WAS NO LONGER TO BE DUPED
1052-132776-0022 THE WHOLE PLAN WAS OPENED TO HIM AND HE APPROVED OF IT BUT IN A FEW DAYS HE BEGAN TO BE UNQUIET HIS MIND WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL TO EMANCIPATE ITSELF FROM THE PREJUDICES OF EDUCATION
1052-132776-0023 HE AT LENGTH TOLD HIS ACCOMPLICES THAT HE COULD GO NO FURTHER WITH THEM IF THEY THOUGHT HIM CAPABLE OF BETRAYING THEM THEY MIGHT STAB HIM AND HE SHOULD HARDLY BLAME THEM FOR BY DRAWING BACK AFTER GOING SO FAR HE HAD GIVEN THEM A KIND OF RIGHT OVER HIS LIFE
