8138-293531-0000 HE HAD DONE HIS BEST HE DECLARED HE HAD INQUIRED AT THE DESK AND WAITED AND WAITED BUT THE HOTEL PEOPLE HAD FAILED TO NOTIFY HIM OF LACKMAN'S ARRIVAL ALL THIS WAS STRICTLY TRUE BUT IT DID NOT PACIFY MC GIVNEY WHO WAS IN A BLACK FURY
8138-293531-0001 WITH THE IDEA THAT HE WOULD PUT UP A GOOD MANY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BE LET OFF PETER MIGHT HAVE HAD HIS SHARE OF THIS ONLY HE HAD BEEN FOOL ENOUGH TO LET THE BIRD GET OUT OF HIS NET PETER OFFERED TO FOLLOW THE YOUNG MAN TO HIS HOME CITY
8138-293531-0002 AND FIND SOME WAY TO LURE HIM BACK INTO MC GIVNEY'S POWER AFTER MC GIVNEY HAD STORMED FOR A WHILE HE DECIDED THAT THIS MIGHT BE POSSIBLE HE WOULD TALK IT OVER WITH THE OTHERS AND LET PETER KNOW
8138-293531-0003 BUT ALAS WHEN PETER PICKED UP AN AFTERNOON NEWSPAPER NEXT DAY HE READ ON THE FRONT PAGE HOW YOUNG LACKMAN STEPPING OFF THE TRAIN IN HIS HOME CITY THAT MORNING HAD BEEN PLACED UNDER ARREST HIS SCHOOL HAD BEEN RAIDED
8138-293531-0004 AND HALF A DOZEN OF THE TEACHERS WERE IN JAIL AND A TON OF RED LITERATURE HAD BEEN CONFISCATED AND A SWARM OF DIRE CONSPIRACIES AGAINST THE SAFETY OF THE COUNTRY HAD BEEN LAID BARE
8138-293531-0005 PETER READ THIS NEWS AND KNEW THAT HE WAS IN FOR ANOTHER STORMY HOUR WITH HIS BOSS BUT HE HARDLY GAVE A THOUGHT TO IT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING WHICH HAD HAPPENED A FEW MINUTES BEFORE SOMETHING OF SO MUCH GREATER IMPORTANCE
8138-293531-0006 A MESSENGER HAD BROUGHT HIM A SPECIAL DELIVERY LETTER AND WITH THUMPING HEART HE HAD TORN IT OPEN AND READ ALL RIGHT MEET ME IN THE WAITING ROOM OF GUGGENHEIM'S DEPARTMENT STORE AT TWO O'CLOCK THIS AFTERNOON BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE FORGET NELL DOOLIN YOURS
8138-293531-0007 SO HERE WAS PETER DRESSED IN HIS BEST CLOTHES AS FOR HIS TEMPORARY HONEYMOON WITH THE GRASS WIDOW AND ON THE WAY TO THE RENDEZVOUS AN HOUR AHEAD OF TIME AND HERE CAME NELL ALSO DRESSED
8138-293531-0008 THE MAN WITH THE BULLDOG FACE WAS A TERROR AND IT WAS HARD TO GET AWAY FROM HIM BECAUSE HE HAD NOTHING TO DO ALL DAY THE WAITING ROOM OF A BIG DEPARTMENT STORE WAS NOT THE PLACE PETER WOULD HAVE SELECTED FOR THE POURING OUT OF HIS HEART BUT HE HAD TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT
8138-293531-0009 THAT HE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO LOVE ANYBODY ELSE AND THAT HE HAD MADE PILES OF MONEY NOW HE WAS HIGH UP ON THE LADDER OF PROSPERITY NELL DID NOT LAUGH AT HIM AS SHE HAD LAUGHED IN THE TEMPLE OF JIMJAMBO FOR IT WAS EASILY TO BE SEEN THAT PETER GUDGE WAS NO LONGER A SCULLION
8138-293531-0010 BUT A MAN OF THE WORLD WITH A FASCINATING AIR OF MYSTERY NELL WANTED TO KNOW FORTHWITH WHAT WAS HE DOING HE ANSWERED THAT HE COULD NOT TELL IT WAS A SECRET OF THE MOST DESPERATE IMPORT HE WAS UNDER OATH THESE WERE THE DAYS OF GERMAN SPIES AND BOMB PLOTS
8138-293531-0011 AND BEING A WOMAN SHE PUT ALL HER FACULTIES UPON THE JOB OF GUESSING IT SHE DID NOT AGAIN ASK PETER TO TELL HER BUT SHE LET HIM TALK AND TACTFULLY GUIDED THE CONVERSATION AND BEFORE LONG SHE KNEW THAT PETER WAS INTIMATE WITH A GREAT MANY OF THE MOST DESPERATE REDS
8138-293531-0012 AND TOLD NELL ALL ABOUT HIS SCHEMES AND HIS ACHIEVEMENTS AND HIS ADVENTURES OMITTING ONLY LITTLE JENNIE AND THE GRASS WIDOW HE TOLD ABOUT THE SUMS HE HAD BEEN MAKING AND WAS EXPECTING TO MAKE
8138-293531-0013 I MEAN SHE ANSWERED THAT HE'D HAVE BEEN WORTH MORE TO YOU THAN ALL THE REST PUT TOGETHER NELL WAS A WOMAN AND HER MIND RAN TO THE PRACTICAL ASPECT OF THINGS LOOK HERE PETER SHE SAID YOU'VE BEEN LETTING THOSE DICKS WORK YOU
8138-293531-0014 THEY'RE GETTING THE SWAG AND JUST GIVING YOU TIPS WHAT YOU NEED IS SOMEBODY TO TAKE CARE OF YOU PETER'S HEART LEAPED WILL YOU DO IT HE CRIED
8138-293531-0015 BUT I'LL TRY TO GET MYSELF FREE AND THEN MAYBE I WON'T PROMISE BUT I'LL THINK OVER YOUR PROBLEM PETER AND I'LL CERTAINLY TRY TO HELP SO THAT MC GIVNEY AND GUFFEY AND THOSE FELLOWS CAN'T PLAY YOU FOR A SUCKER ANY LONGER
8138-293531-0016 SHE MUST HAVE TIME TO THINK IT OVER SHE SAID AND TO MAKE INQUIRIES ABOUT THE PEOPLE INVOLVED SOME OF WHOM APPARENTLY SHE KNEW SHE WOULD MEET PETER AGAIN THE NEXT DAY AND IN A MORE PRIVATE PLACE THAN HERE
8138-293531-0017 SHE NAMED A SPOT IN THE CITY PARK WHICH WOULD BE EASY TO FIND AND YET SUFFICIENTLY REMOTE FOR A QUIET CONFERENCE SECTION FORTY PETER HAD BEEN MADE SO BOLD BY NELL'S FLATTERY AND WHAT SHE HAD SAID ABOUT HIS IMPORTANCE
8138-293531-0018 THAT HE DID NOT GO BACK TO MC GIVNEY TO TAKE HIS SECOND SCOLDING ABOUT THE LACKMAN CASE HE WAS GETTING TIRED OF MC GIVNEY'S SCOLDINGS IF MC GIVNEY DIDN'T LIKE HIS WORK LET MC GIVNEY GO AND BE A RED FOR A WHILE HIMSELF PETER WALKED THE STREETS ALL DAY AND A PART OF THE NIGHT THINKING ABOUT NELL
8138-293531-0019 AND THRILLING OVER THE HALF PROMISES SHE HAD MADE HIM THEY MET NEXT DAY IN THE PARK NO ONE WAS FOLLOWING THEM AND THEY FOUND A SOLITARY PLACE AND NELL LET HIM KISS HER SEVERAL TIMES AND IN BETWEEN THE KISSES SHE UNFOLDED TO HIM A TERRIFYING PLAN
8138-293531-0020 PETER HAD THOUGHT THAT HE WAS SOMETHING OF AN INTRIGUER BUT HIS SELF ESTEEM SHRIVELED TO NOTHINGNESS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SUPERB CONCEPTION WHICH HAD COME TO RIPENESS IN THE SPACE OF TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN THE BRAIN OF NELL DOOLIN
8138-293531-0021 PETER HAD BEEN DOING THE HARD WORK AND THESE BIG FELLOWS HAD BEEN USING HIM HANDING HIM A TIP NOW AND THEN AND MAKING FORTUNES OUT OF THE INFORMATION HE BROUGHT THEM MC GIVNEY HAD LET THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG IN THIS CASE OF LACKMAN
8138-293531-0022 YOU MIGHT BE SURE THEY HAD BEEN MAKING MONEY BIG MONEY OUT OF ALL THE OTHER CASES WHAT PETER MUST DO WAS TO WORK UP SOMETHING OF HIS OWN AND GET THE REAL MONEY AND MAKE HIMSELF ONE OF THE BIG FELLOWS PETER HAD THE FACTS HE KNEW THE PEOPLE
8138-293531-0023 HE HAD WATCHED IN THE GOOBER CASE EXACTLY HOW A FRAME UP WAS MADE AND NOW HE MUST MAKE ONE FOR HIMSELF AND ONE THAT WOULD PAY IT WAS A MATTER OF DUTY TO RID THE COUNTRY OF ALL THESE REDS BUT WHY SHOULD HE NOT HAVE THE MONEY AS WELL NELL HAD SPENT THE NIGHT FIGURING OVER IT
8138-293531-0024 TRYING TO PICK OUT THE RIGHT PERSON SHE HAD HIT ON OLD NELSE ACKERMAN THE BANKER ACKERMAN WAS ENORMOUSLY AND INCREDIBLY WEALTHY HE WAS CALLED THE FINANCIAL KING OF AMERICAN CITY ALSO HE WAS OLD AND NELL HAPPENED TO KNOW HE WAS A COWARD
8138-293531-0025 OR HE MIGHT FRAME UP SOME LETTERS TO BE FOUND UPON THEM AND HIDE SOME DYNAMITE IN THEIR ROOMS WHEN THE PLOT WAS DISCOVERED IT WOULD MAKE A FRIGHTFUL UPROAR NEEDLESS TO SAY THE KING WOULD HEAR OF IT AND OF PETER'S PART AS THE DISCOVERER OF IT
8138-293531-0026 AND HE WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY REWARD PETER PERHAPS PETER MIGHT ARRANGE TO BE RETAINED AS A SECRET AGENT TO PROTECT THE KING FROM THE REDS THUS PETER WOULD BE IN TOUCH WITH REAL MONEY AND MIGHT HIRE GUFFEY AND MC GIVNEY INSTEAD OF THEIR HIRING HIM
8138-293531-0027 IF PETER HAD STOOD ALONE WOULD HE HAVE DARED SO PERILOUS A DREAM AS THIS OR WAS HE A PIKER A LITTLE FELLOW THE VICTIM OF HIS OWN FEARS AND VANITIES
8138-293531-0028 FITTED PERFECTLY TO PETER'S CONCEPTION OF A DYNAMITER ALSO MAC WAS PETER'S PERSONAL ENEMY MAC HAD JUST RETURNED FROM HIS ORGANIZING TRIP IN THE OIL FIELDS AND HAD BEEN DENOUNCING PETER AND GOSSIPING ABOUT HIM IN THE VARIOUS RADICAL GROUPS
8138-293531-0029 MAC WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS RED OF THEM ALL HE MUST SURELY BE ONE OF THE DYNAMITERS ANOTHER LIKELY ONE WAS JOE ANGELL WHOM PETER HAD MET AT A RECENT GATHERING OF ADA RUTH'S ANTI CONSCRIPTION LEAGUE PEOPLE MADE JOKES ABOUT THIS CHAP'S NAME
8138-293531-0030 BECAUSE HE LOOKED THE PART WITH HIS BRIGHT BLUE EYES THAT SEEMED TO HAVE COME OUT OF HEAVEN AND HIS BRIGHT GOLDEN HAIR AND EVEN THE MEMORY OF DIMPLES IN HIS CHEEKS BUT WHEN JOE OPENED HIS LIPS YOU DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS AN ANGEL FROM THE NETHER REGIONS
8138-293531-0031 HE WAS THE BOLDEST AND MOST DEFIANT OF ALL THE REDS THAT PETER HAD YET COME UPON HE HAD LAUGHED AT ADA RUTH AND HER SENTIMENTAL LITERARY ATTITUDE TOWARD THE SUBJECT OF THE DRAFT IT WASN'T WRITING POEMS AND PASSING RESOLUTIONS THAT WAS WANTED
8138-293531-0032 BUT NOW WHEN THE GOVERNMENT DARED CHALLENGE THE WORKERS AND FORCE THEM INTO THE ARMY IT WAS MEN OF ACTION THAT WERE NEEDED IN THE RADICAL MOVEMENT JOE ANGELL HAD BEEN UP IN THE LUMBER COUNTRY AND COULD TELL WHAT WAS THE MOOD OF THE REAL WORKERS THE HUSKIES OF THE TIMBERLANDS
