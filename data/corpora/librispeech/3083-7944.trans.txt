3083-7944-0001 AN WOULD BE TOO IF FOLKS CARED HALF AS MUCH BOUT BREEDING FOLKS AS THEY DO BOUT RAISING HOGS AN HORSES MISTER MATTHEWS WAS A GIANT FULLY SIX FEET FOUR INCHES IN HEIGHT
3083-7944-0002 WITH BIG BONES BROAD SHOULDERS AND MIGHTY MUSCLES AT LOG ROLLINGS AND CHOPPING BEES IN THE FIELD OR AT THE MILL OR IN ANY OF THE GAMES IN WHICH THE BACKWOODSMAN TRIES HIS STRENGTH
3083-7944-0003 NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCESSFULLY CONTESTED HIS PLACE AS THE STRONGEST MAN IN THE HILLS AND STILL THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY SIDE THE OLD FOLKS TELL WITH PRIDE TALES OF THE MARVELOUS FEATS OF STRENGTH PERFORMED IN THE DAYS WHEN OLD MATT WAS YOUNG
3083-7944-0004 OF THE SON YOUNG MATT THE PEOPLE CALLED HIM IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY THAT HE SEEMED MADE OF THE SAME METAL AND CAST IN THE SAME MOLD AS THE FATHER A MIGHTY FRAME SOFTENED YET BY YOUNG MANHOOD'S GRACE
3083-7944-0005 A POWERFUL NECK AND WELL POISED HEAD WITH WAVY RED BROWN HAIR AND BLUE EYES THAT HAD IN THEM THE CALM OF SUMMER SKIES OR THE GLINT OF BATTLE STEEL IT WAS A COUNTENANCE FEARLESS AND FRANK BUT GENTLE AND KIND
3083-7944-0006 AND THE EYES WERE HONEST EYES ANYONE MEETING THE PAIR AS THEY WALKED WITH THE LONG SWINGING STRIDE OF THE MOUNTAINEER UP THE STEEP MILL ROAD THAT GRAY AFTERNOON WOULD HAVE TURNED FOR A SECOND LOOK SUCH MEN ARE SELDOM SEEN
3083-7944-0007 WHEN THEY REACHED THE BIG LOG HOUSE THAT LOOKS DOWN UPON THE HOLLOW THE BOY WENT AT ONCE WITH HIS AXE TO THE WOODPILE WHILE THE OLDER MAN BUSIED HIMSELF WITH THE MILKING AND OTHER CHORES ABOUT THE BARN
3083-7944-0008 YOUNG MATT HAD NOT BEEN CHOPPING LONG WHEN HE HEARD COMING UP THE HILL THE SOUND OF A HORSE'S FEET ON THE OLD TRAIL THE HORSE STOPPED AT THE HOUSE AND A VOICE THAT STIRRED THE BLOOD IN THE YOUNG MAN'S VEINS CALLED

3083-7944-0013 AND YOUNG MATT WAS FIRST AT THE BARN YARD GATE MISS SAMMY LANE WAS ONE OF THOSE RARE YOUNG WOMEN WHOSE APPEARANCE IS NOT TO BE DESCRIBED ONE CAN OF COURSE PUT IT DOWN THAT SHE WAS TALL BEAUTIFULLY TALL WITH THE TRIMNESS OF A YOUNG PINE
3083-7944-0014 DEEP BOSOMED WITH LIMBS FULL ROUNDED FAIRLY TINGLING WITH THE LIFE AND STRENGTH OF PERFECT WOMANHOOD AND IT MAY BE SAID THAT HER FACE WAS A FACE TO GO WITH ONE THROUGH THE YEARS AND TO LIVE STILL IN ONE'S DREAMS WHEN THE SAP OF LIFE IS GONE
3083-7944-0015 AND WITHERED AND OLD ONE SITS SHAKING BEFORE THE FIRE A GENEROUS LOVING MOUTH RED LIPPED FULL ARCHED WITH THE CORNERS TUCKED IN AND PERFECT TEETH BETWEEN A WOMANLY CHIN AND NOSE WITH CHARACTER ENOUGH TO SAVE THEM FROM BEING PRETTY
3083-7944-0016 HAIR DARK SHOWING A TOUCH OF GOLD WITH UMBER IN THE SHADOWS A BROW FULL BROAD SET OVER BROWN EYES THAT HAD NEVER BEEN TAUGHT TO HIDE BEHIND THEIR FRINGED VEILS BUT LOOKED ALWAYS SQUARE OUT AT YOU WITH A HEALTHY LOOK OF GOOD COMRADESHIP A GLEAM OF MIRTH
3083-7944-0017 OR A SUDDEN WIDE QUESTIONING GAZE THAT REVEALED DEPTH OF SOUL WITHIN BUT WHAT IS THE USE WHEN ALL THIS IS WRITTEN THOSE WHO KNEW SAMMY WILL SAY TIS BUT A POOR PICTURE FOR SHE IS SOMETHING MORE THAN ALL THIS
3083-7944-0018 HIT SURE DO IKE GREETING THE GIRL THE YOUNG MAN OPENED THE GATE FOR HER TO PASS I'VE BEEN A LOOKIN FOR YOU OVER SAID SAMMY A TEASING LIGHT IN HER EYES DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT MANDY WAS STOPPIN WITH ME

3083-7944-0020 HE ADDED WITH A SMILE AS HE RAISED HIS ARMS TO ASSIST THE GIRL TO DISMOUNT THE TEASING LIGHT VANISHED AS THE YOUNG WOMAN PLACED HER HANDS ON THE POWERFUL SHOULDERS OF THE GIANT
3083-7944-0021 AND AS SHE FELT THE PLAY OF THE SWELLING MUSCLES THAT SWUNG HER TO THE GROUND SO EASILY HER FACE FLUSHED WITH ADMIRATION FOR THE FRACTION OF A MINUTE SHE STOOD FACING HIM HER HANDS STILL ON HIS ARMS HER LIPS PARTED AS IF TO SPEAK
3083-7944-0022 THEN SHE TURNED QUICKLY AWAY AND WITHOUT A WORD WALKED TOWARD THE HOUSE WHILE THE BOY PRETENDING TO BUSY HIMSELF WITH THE PONY'S BRIDLE WATCHED HER AS SHE WENT WHEN THE GIRL WAS GONE THE BIG FELLOW LED THE HORSE AWAY TO THE STABLE
3083-7944-0023 WHERE HE CROSSED HIS ARMS UPON THE SADDLE AND HID HIS FACE FROM THE LIGHT MISTER MATTHEWS COMING QUIETLY TO THE DOOR A FEW MINUTES LATER SAW THE BOY STANDING THERE AND THE RUGGED FACE OF THE BIG MOUNTAINEER SOFTENED AT THE SIGHT QUIETLY
3083-7944-0024 HE WITHDREW TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BARN TO RETURN LATER WHEN THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE YOUNG MAN STOOD STROKING THE PONY AS THE LITTLE HORSE MUNCHED HIS GENEROUS FEED OF CORN
3083-7944-0025 THE ELDER MAN LAID HIS HAND ON THE BROAD SHOULDER OF THE LAD SO LIKE HIM AND LOOKED FULL INTO THE CLEAR EYES IS IT ALRIGHT SON HE ASKED GRUFFLY AND THE BOY ANSWERED AS HE RETURNED HIS FATHER'S LOOK

3083-7944-0027 THE STRANGER WHOM JED HAD MET ON THE OLD TRAIL STOOD AT THE GATE CHAPTER THREE THE VOICE FROM OUT THE MISTS WHILE YOUNG MATT WAS GONE TO THE CORRAL IN THE VALLEY
3083-7944-0028 TO SEE THAT THE SHEEP WERE SAFELY FOLDED FOR THE NIGHT AND THE TWO WOMEN WERE BUSY IN THE HOUSE WITH THEIR AFTER SUPPER WORK MISTER MATTHEWS AND HIS GUEST SAT ON THE FRONT PORCH MY NAME IS HOWITT DANIEL HOWITT
3083-7944-0029 THE MAN SAID IN ANSWER TO THE HOST'S QUESTION BUT AS HE SPOKE THERE WAS IN HIS MANNER A TOUCH OF EMBARRASSMENT AND HE CONTINUED QUICKLY AS IF TO PREVENT FURTHER QUESTION YOU HAVE TWO REMARKABLE CHILDREN SIR

3083-7944-0031 THE GRIM FACE OF THE ELDER MATTHEWS SHOWED BOTH PLEASURE AND AMUSEMENT YOU'RE MISTAKEN MISTER THE BOY'S MINE ALRIGHT AN HE'S ALL THAT YOU SAY AN MORE I RECKON
3083-7944-0032 I DOUBT IF THERE'S A MAN IN THE HILLS CAN MATCH HIM TO DAY NOT EXCEPTING WASH GIBBS AN HE'S A MIGHTY GOOD BOY TOO BUT THE GIRL IS A DAUGHTER OF A NEIGHBOR AND NO KIN AT ALL INDEED EXCLAIMED THE OTHER
3083-7944-0033 YOU HAVE ONLY ONE CHILD THEN THE AMUSED SMILE LEFT THE FACE OF THE OLD MOUNTAINEER AS HE ANSWERED SLOWLY THERE WAS SIX BOYS SIR THIS ONE GRANT IS THE YOUNGEST
3083-7944-0034 THE OTHERS LIE OVER THERE HE POINTED WITH HIS PIPE TO WHERE A CLUMP OF PINES NOT FAR FROM THE HOUSE SHOWED DARK AND TALL AGAINST THE LAST RED GLOW IN THE SKY THE STRANGER GLANCED AT THE BIG MAN'S FACE IN QUICK SYMPATHY
3083-7944-0035 I HAD ONLY TWO A BOY AND A GIRL HE SAID SOFTLY THE GIRL AND HER MOTHER HAVE BEEN GONE THESE TWENTY YEARS THE BOY GREW TO BE A MAN AND NOW HE HAS LEFT ME
3083-7944-0036 THE DEEP VOICE FALTERED PARDON ME SIR FOR SPEAKING OF THIS BUT MY LAD WAS SO LIKE YOUR BOY THERE HE WAS ALL I HAD AND NOW
3083-7944-0037 NOW I AM VERY LONELY SIR THERE IS A BOND OF FELLOWSHIP IN SORROW THAT KNOWS NO CONVENTIONALITIES AS THE TWO MEN SAT IN THE HUSH OF THE COMING NIGHT
3083-7944-0038 THEIR FACES TURNED TOWARD THE SOMBER GROUP OF TREES THEY FELT STRONGLY DRAWN TO ONE ANOTHER THE MOUNTAINEER'S COMPANION SPOKE AGAIN HALF TO HIMSELF I WISH THAT MY DEAR ONES HAD A RESTING PLACE LIKE THAT
3083-7944-0039 IN THE CROWDED CITY CEMETERY THE GROUND IS ALWAYS SHAKEN BY THE TRAMPING OF FUNERAL PROFESSIONS HE BURIED HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS FOR SOME TIME THE STRANGER SAT THUS WHILE HIS HOST SPOKE NO WORD
3083-7944-0040 THEN LIFTING HIS HEAD THE MAN LOOKED AWAY OVER THE RIDGES JUST TOUCHED WITH THE LINGERING LIGHT AND THE VALLEY BELOW WRAPPED IN THE SHADOWY MISTS I CAME AWAY FROM IT ALL BECAUSE THEY SAID I MUST
3083-7944-0041 AND BECAUSE I WAS HUNGRY FOR THIS HE WAVED HIS HAND TOWARD THE GLOWING SKY AND THE FOREST CLAD HILLS THIS IS GOOD FOR ME IT SOMEHOW SEEMS TO HELP ME KNOW HOW BIG GOD IS ONE COULD FIND PEACE HERE
3083-7944-0042 SURELY SIR ONE COULD FIND IT HERE PEACE AND STRENGTH THE MOUNTAINEER PUFFED HARD AT HIS PIPE FOR A WHILE THEN SAID GRUFFLY SEEMS THAT WAY MISTER TO THEM THAT DON'T KNOW
3083-7944-0043 BUT MANY'S THE TIME I'VE WISHED TO GOD I'D NEVER SEEN THESE HERE OZARKS I USED TO FEEL LIKE YOU DO BUT I CAN'T NO MORE THEY MIND ME NOW OF HIM THAT BLACKENED MY LIFE
3083-7944-0044 HE USED TO TAKE ON POWERFUL ABOUT THE BEAUTY OF THE COUNTRY AND ALL THE TIME HE WAS A TURNIN IT INTO A HELL FOR THEM THAT HAD TO STAY HERE AFTER HE WAS GONE AS HE SPOKE ANGER AND HATRED GREW DARK IN THE GIANT'S FACE
3083-7944-0045 AND THE STRANGER SAW THE BIG HANDS CLENCH AND THE HUGE FRAME GROW TENSE WITH PASSION THEN AS IF STRIVING TO BE NOT UNGRACIOUS THE WOODSMAN SAID IN A SOMEWHAT SOFTER TONE
3083-7944-0046 YOU CAN'T SEE MUCH OF IT THIS EVENING THOUGH COUNT OF THE MISTS IT'LL FAIR UP BY MORNING I RECKON YOU CAN SEE A LONG WAY FROM HERE OF A CLEAR DAY MISTER YES INDEED
3083-7944-0047 SMALL WONDER OUR LIVES HAVE SO LITTLE OF GOD IN THEM WHEN WE COME IN TOUCH WITH SO LITTLE THAT GOD HAS MADE YOU LIVE IN THE CITY THEN WHEN YOU ARE AT HOME ASKED MISTER MATTHEWS LOOKING CURIOUSLY AT HIS GUEST
3083-7944-0048 I DID WHEN I HAD A HOME I CANNOT SAY THAT I LIVE ANYWHERE NOW OLD MATT LEANED FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR AS IF TO SPEAK AGAIN THEN PAUSED SOMEONE WAS COMING UP THE HILL
3083-7944-0049 AND SOON THEY DISTINGUISHED THE STALWART FORM OF THE SON SAMMY COMING FROM THE HOUSE WITH AN EMPTY BUCKET MET THE YOUNG MAN AT THE GATE AND THE TWO WENT TOWARD THE SPRING TOGETHER
3083-7944-0050 IN SILENCE THE MEN ON THE PORCH WATCHED THE MOON AS SHE SLOWLY PUSHED HER WAY UP THROUGH THE LEAFY SCREEN ON THE MOUNTAIN WALL HIGHER AND HIGHER SHE CLIMBED UNTIL HER RAYS FELL INTO THE VALLEY BELOW
3083-7944-0051 AND THE DRIFTING MISTS FROM RIDGE TO RIDGE BECAME A SEA OF GHOSTLY LIGHT IT WAS A WEIRD SCENE ALMOST SUPERNATURAL IN ITS BEAUTY THEN FROM DOWN AT THE SPRING A YOUNG GIRL'S LAUGH ROSE CLEARLY
3083-7944-0052 AND THE BIG MOUNTAINEER SAID IN A LOW TONE MISTER HOWITT YOU'VE GOT EDUCATION IT'S EASY TO SEE THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO ASK SOMEBODY LIKE YOU DO YOU BELIEVE IN HANTS
3083-7944-0053 THE MAN FROM THE CITY SAW THAT HIS BIG HOST WAS TERRIBLY IN EARNEST AND ANSWERED QUIETLY NO I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH THINGS MISTER MATTHEWS BUT IF IT SHOULD BE TRUE
3083-7944-0054 I DO NOT SEE WHY WE SHOULD FEAR THE DEAD THE OTHER SHOOK HIS HEAD I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW SIR I ALWAYS SAID I DIDN'T BELIEVE BUT SOME THINGS IS MIGHTY QUEER
3083-7944-0055 HE SEEMED TO BE SHAPING HIS THOUGHT FOR FURTHER SPEECH WHEN AGAIN THE GIRL'S LAUGH RANG CLEAR ALONG THE MOUNTAIN SIDE THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE RETURNING FROM THE SPRING
3083-7944-0056 THE MOUNTAINEER RELIGHTED HIS PIPE WHILE YOUNG MATT AND SAMMY SEATED THEMSELVES ON THE STEP AND MISSUS MATTHEWS COMING FROM THE HOUSE JOINED THE GROUP WE'VE JUST NATURALLY GOT TO FIND SOMEBODY TO STAY WITH THEM SHEEP DAD SAID THE SON
3083-7944-0057 THERE AIN'T NOBODY THERE TO NIGHT AND AS NEAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT THERE'S THREE EWES AND THEIR LAMBS MISSING THERE AIN'T A BIT OF USE IN US TRYING TO DEPEND ON PETE I'LL RIDE OVER ON BEAR CREEK TO MORROW AND SEE IF I CAN GET THAT FELLOW BUCK TOLD US ABOUT
3083-7944-0058 RETURNED THE FATHER YOU FIND IT HARD TO GET HELP ON THE RANCH INQUIRED THE STRANGER YES SIR WE DO ANSWERED OLD MATT WE HAD A GOOD NOUGH MAN TILL ABOUT A MONTH AGO
3083-7944-0059 UNLESS THAT ONE OVER ON BEAR CREEK WILL COME I RECKON THOUGH HE'LL BE LIKE THE REST HE SAT STARING GLOOMILY INTO THE NIGHT IS THE WORK SO DIFFICULT MISTER HOWITT ASKED
3083-7944-0060 DIFFICULT NO THERE AIN'T NOTHING TO DO BUT TENDIN TO THE SHEEP THE MAN HAS TO STAY AT THE RANCH OF NIGHTS THOUGH MISTER HOWITT WAS WONDERING WHAT STAYING AT THE RANCH NIGHTS COULD HAVE TO DO WITH THE DIFFICULTY
3083-7944-0061 WHEN UP FROM THE VALLEY BELOW FROM OUT THE DARKNESS AND THE MISTS CAME A STRANGE SOUND A SOUND AS IF SOMEONE WERE SINGING A SONG WITHOUT WORDS SO WILD AND WEIRD WAS THE MELODY
3083-7944-0062 SO PASSIONATELY SWEET THE VOICE IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE MUSIC SHOULD COME FROM HUMAN LIPS IT WAS MORE AS THOUGH SOME GENIE OF THE FOREST CLAD HILLS WANDERED THROUGH THE MISTS SINGING AS HE WENT WITH THE JOY OF HIS POSSESSIONS
3083-7944-0063 MISSUS MATTHEWS CAME CLOSE TO HER HUSBAND'S SIDE AND PLACED HER HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER AS HE HALF ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR HIS PIPE FALLEN TO THE FLOOR YOUNG MATT ROSE TO HIS FEET AND MOVED CLOSER TO THE GIRL WHO WAS ALSO STANDING
3083-7944-0064 THE STRANGER ALONE KEPT HIS SEAT AND HE NOTED THE AGITATION OF THE OTHERS IN WONDER FOR SOME MOMENTS THE SOUND CONTINUED NOW SOFT AND LOW WITH THE SWEET SADNESS OF THE WIND IN THE PINES
3083-7944-0065 THEN CLEAR AND RINGING
3083-7944-0066 NOW PLEADINGS AS THOUGH A SOUL IN DARKNESS PRAYED A GLEAM OF LIGHT AGAIN RISING SWELLING EXULTINGLY AS IN GLAD TRIUMPH ONLY TO DIE AWAY ONCE MORE TO THAT MOANING WAIL
3083-7944-0067 SEEMING AT LAST TO LOSE ITSELF IN THE MISTS SLOWLY OLD MATT SANK BACK INTO HIS SEAT AND THE STRANGER HEARD HIM MUTTER POOR BOY POOR BOY
3083-7944-0068 AUNT MOLLIE WAS WEEPING SUDDENLY SAMMY SPRANG FROM THE STEPS AND RUNNING DOWN THE WALK TO THE GATE SENT A CLEAR PIERCING CALL OVER THE VALLEY
3083-7944-0069 AGAIN THE GIRL CALLED AND YET AGAIN
3083-7944-0070 IT'S NO USE HONEY SAID MISSUS MATTHEWS BREAKING THE SILENCE IT JUST AIN'T NO USE
