851-131029-0000 THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL SATURDAY FEBRUARY SIXTEENTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MADISON TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
851-131029-0001 THE SECOND CHARGE AGAINST THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IS THAT IT WILL BE TOO SMALL TO POSSESS A DUE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERESTS OF ITS CONSTITUENTS
851-131029-0002 AS THIS OBJECTION EVIDENTLY PROCEEDS FROM A COMPARISON OF THE PROPOSED NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES WITH THE GREAT EXTENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE NUMBER OF THEIR INHABITANTS AND THE DIVERSITY OF THEIR INTERESTS
851-131029-0003 WITHOUT TAKING INTO VIEW AT THE SAME TIME THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WILL DISTINGUISH THE CONGRESS FROM OTHER LEGISLATIVE BODIES THE BEST ANSWER THAT CAN BE GIVEN TO IT WILL BE A BRIEF EXPLANATION OF THESE PECULIARITIES
851-131029-0004 IT IS A SOUND AND IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE OUGHT TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE INTERESTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS CONSTITUENTS BUT THIS PRINCIPLE CAN EXTEND NO FURTHER THAN TO THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES AND INTERESTS
851-131029-0005 TO WHICH THE AUTHORITY AND CARE OF THE REPRESENTATIVE RELATE AN IGNORANCE OF A VARIETY OF MINUTE AND PARTICULAR OBJECTS WHICH DO NOT LIE WITHIN THE COMPASS OF LEGISLATION IS CONSISTENT WITH EVERY ATTRIBUTE NECESSARY TO A DUE PERFORMANCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE TRUST
851-131029-0006 IN DETERMINING THE EXTENT OF INFORMATION REQUIRED IN THE EXERCISE OF A PARTICULAR AUTHORITY RECOURSE THEN MUST BE HAD TO THE OBJECTS WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THAT AUTHORITY WHAT ARE TO BE THE OBJECTS OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION
851-131029-0007 THOSE WHICH ARE OF MOST IMPORTANCE AND WHICH SEEM MOST TO REQUIRE LOCAL KNOWLEDGE ARE COMMERCE TAXATION AND THE MILITIA A PROPER REGULATION OF COMMERCE REQUIRES MUCH INFORMATION AS HAS BEEN ELSEWHERE REMARKED
851-131029-0008 BUT AS FAR AS THIS INFORMATION RELATES TO THE LAWS AND LOCAL SITUATION OF EACH INDIVIDUAL STATE A VERY FEW REPRESENTATIVES WOULD BE VERY SUFFICIENT VEHICLES OF IT TO THE FEDERAL COUNCILS TAXATION WILL CONSIST IN A GREAT MEASURE
851-131029-0009 OF DUTIES WHICH WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE REGULATION OF COMMERCE SO FAR THE PRECEDING REMARK IS APPLICABLE TO THIS OBJECT AS FAR AS IT MAY CONSIST OF INTERNAL COLLECTIONS A MORE DIFFUSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE STATE MAY BE NECESSARY
851-131029-0010 BUT WILL NOT THIS ALSO BE POSSESSED IN SUFFICIENT DEGREE BY A VERY FEW INTELLIGENT MEN DIFFUSIVELY ELECTED WITHIN THE STATE DIVIDE THE LARGEST STATE INTO TEN OR TWELVE DISTRICTS
851-131029-0011 AND IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THERE WILL BE NO PECULIAR LOCAL INTERESTS IN EITHER WHICH WILL NOT BE WITHIN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DISTRICT BESIDES THIS SOURCE OF INFORMATION THE LAWS OF THE STATE FRAMED BY REPRESENTATIVES FROM EVERY PART OF IT
851-131029-0012 WILL BE ALMOST OF THEMSELVES A SUFFICIENT GUIDE IN EVERY STATE THERE HAVE BEEN MADE AND MUST CONTINUE TO BE MADE REGULATIONS ON THIS SUBJECT WHICH WILL IN MANY CASES LEAVE LITTLE MORE TO BE DONE BY THE FEDERAL LEGISLATURE
851-131029-0013 THAN TO REVIEW THE DIFFERENT LAWS AND REDUCE THEM IN ONE GENERAL ACT A SKILLFUL INDIVIDUAL IN HIS CLOSET WITH ALL THE LOCAL CODES BEFORE HIM MIGHT COMPILE A LAW ON SOME SUBJECTS OF TAXATION FOR THE WHOLE UNION
851-131029-0014 WITHOUT ANY AID FROM ORAL INFORMATION AND IT MAY BE EXPECTED THAT WHENEVER INTERNAL TAXES MAY BE NECESSARY AND PARTICULARLY IN CASES REQUIRING UNIFORMITY THROUGHOUT THE STATES THE MORE SIMPLE OBJECTS WILL BE PREFERRED
851-131029-0015 TO BE FULLY SENSIBLE OF THE FACILITY WHICH WILL BE GIVEN TO THIS BRANCH OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION BY THE ASSISTANCE OF THE STATE CODES WE NEED ONLY SUPPOSE FOR A MOMENT THAT THIS OR ANY OTHER STATE WERE DIVIDED INTO A NUMBER OF PARTS
851-131029-0016 EACH HAVING AND EXERCISING WITHIN ITSELF A POWER OF LOCAL LEGISLATION IS IT NOT EVIDENT THAT A DEGREE OF LOCAL INFORMATION AND PREPARATORY LABOR WOULD BE FOUND IN THE SEVERAL VOLUMES OF THEIR PROCEEDINGS
851-131029-0017 THE FEDERAL COUNCILS WILL DERIVE GREAT ADVANTAGE FROM ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF EACH STATE WILL NOT ONLY BRING WITH THEM A CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF ITS LAWS AND A LOCAL KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE DISTRICTS
851-131029-0018 BUT WILL PROBABLY IN ALL CASES HAVE BEEN MEMBERS AND MAY EVEN AT THE VERY TIME BE MEMBERS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE WHERE ALL THE LOCAL INFORMATION AND INTERESTS OF THE STATE ARE ASSEMBLED
851-131029-0019 AND FROM WHENCE THEY MAY EASILY BE CONVEYED BY A VERY FEW HANDS INTO THE LEGISLATURE OF THE UNITED STATES
851-131029-0020 THE OBSERVATIONS MADE ON THE SUBJECT OF TAXATION APPLY WITH GREATER FORCE TO THE CASE OF THE MILITIA FOR HOWEVER DIFFERENT THE RULES OF DISCIPLINE MAY BE IN DIFFERENT STATES THEY ARE THE SAME THROUGHOUT EACH PARTICULAR STATE
851-131029-0021 AND DEPEND ON CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH CAN DIFFER BUT LITTLE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SAME STATE
851-131029-0022 THE GENERAL FACE OF THE COUNTRY WHETHER MOUNTAINOUS OR LEVEL MOST FIT FOR THE OPERATIONS OF INFANTRY OR CAVALRY IS ALMOST THE ONLY CONSIDERATION OF THIS NATURE THAT CAN OCCUR THE ART OF WAR TEACHES GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ORGANIZATION MOVEMENT AND DISCIPLINE
851-131029-0023 DOES NOT IN ANY RESPECT CONTRADICT WHAT WAS URGED ON ANOTHER OCCASION WITH REGARD TO THE EXTENSIVE INFORMATION
851-131029-0024 AND THE TIME THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR ACQUIRING IT THIS INFORMATION SO FAR AS IT MAY RELATE TO LOCAL OBJECTS IS RENDERED NECESSARY AND DIFFICULT NOT BY A DIFFERENCE OF LAWS AND LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES WITHIN A SINGLE STATE
851-131029-0025 BUT OF THOSE AMONG DIFFERENT STATES TAKING EACH STATE BY ITSELF ITS LAWS ARE THE SAME AND ITS INTERESTS BUT LITTLE DIVERSIFIED A FEW MEN THEREFORE WILL POSSESS ALL THE KNOWLEDGE REQUISITE FOR A PROPER REPRESENTATION OF THEM
851-131029-0026 WERE THE INTERESTS AND AFFAIRS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL STATE PERFECTLY SIMPLE AND UNIFORM A KNOWLEDGE OF THEM IN ONE PART WOULD INVOLVE A KNOWLEDGE OF THEM IN EVERY OTHER AND THE WHOLE STATE MIGHT BE COMPETENTLY REPRESENTED BY A SINGLE MEMBER TAKEN FROM ANY PART OF IT
851-131029-0027 ON A COMPARISON OF THE DIFFERENT STATES TOGETHER WE FIND A GREAT DISSIMILARITY IN THEIR LAWS AND IN MANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE OBJECTS OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION WITH ALL OF WHICH THE FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES OUGHT TO HAVE SOME ACQUAINTANCE
851-131029-0028 WHILST A FEW REPRESENTATIVES THEREFORE FROM EACH STATE MAY BRING WITH THEM A DUE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR OWN STATE EVERY REPRESENTATIVE WILL HAVE MUCH INFORMATION TO ACQUIRE CONCERNING ALL THE OTHER STATES THE CHANGES OF TIME
851-131029-0029 AS WAS FORMERLY REMARKED ON THE COMPARATIVE SITUATION OF THE DIFFERENT STATES WILL HAVE AN ASSIMILATING EFFECT THE EFFECT OF TIME ON THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THE STATES TAKEN SINGLY WILL BE JUST THE CONTRARY
851-131029-0030 AT PRESENT SOME OF THE STATES ARE LITTLE MORE THAN A SOCIETY OF HUSBANDMEN FEW OF THEM HAVE MADE MUCH PROGRESS IN THOSE BRANCHES OF INDUSTRY WHICH GIVE A VARIETY AND COMPLEXITY TO THE AFFAIRS OF A NATION THESE HOWEVER
851-131029-0031 WILL IN ALL OF THEM BE THE FRUITS OF A MORE ADVANCED POPULATION AND WILL REQUIRE ON THE PART OF EACH STATE A FULLER REPRESENTATION
851-131029-0032 THE FORESIGHT OF THE CONVENTION HAS ACCORDINGLY TAKEN CARE THAT THE PROGRESS OF POPULATION MAY BE ACCOMPANIED WITH A PROPER INCREASE OF THE REPRESENTATIVE BRANCH OF THE GOVERNMENT THE EXPERIENCE OF GREAT BRITAIN
851-131029-0033 WHICH PRESENTS TO MANKIND SO MANY POLITICAL LESSONS BOTH OF THE MONITORY AND EXEMPLARY KIND AND WHICH HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY CONSULTED IN THE COURSE OF THESE INQUIRIES CORROBORATES THE RESULT OF THE REFLECTIONS WHICH WE HAVE JUST MADE
851-131029-0034 THE NUMBER OF INHABITANTS IN THE TWO KINGDOMS OF ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND CANNOT BE STATED AT LESS THAN EIGHT MILLIONS THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THESE EIGHT MILLIONS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AMOUNT TO FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT
851-131029-0035 OF THIS NUMBER ONE NINTH ARE ELECTED BY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR PERSONS AND ONE HALF BY FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE PERSONS
851-131029-0036 IT CANNOT BE SUPPOSED THAT THE HALF THUS ELECTED AND WHO DO NOT EVEN RESIDE AMONG THE PEOPLE AT LARGE CAN ADD ANY THING EITHER TO THE SECURITY OF THE PEOPLE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OR TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND INTERESTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCILS
851-131029-0037 ON THE CONTRARY IT IS NOTORIOUS THAT THEY ARE MORE FREQUENTLY THE REPRESENTATIVES AND INSTRUMENTS OF THE EXECUTIVE MAGISTRATE THAN THE GUARDIANS AND ADVOCATES OF THE POPULAR RIGHTS
851-131029-0038 THEY MIGHT THEREFORE WITH GREAT PROPRIETY BE CONSIDERED AS SOMETHING MORE THAN A MERE DEDUCTION FROM THE REAL REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION WE WILL HOWEVER CONSIDER THEM IN THIS LIGHT ALONE
851-131029-0039 AND WILL NOT EXTEND THE DEDUCTION TO A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF OTHERS WHO DO NOT RESIDE AMONG THEIR CONSTITUTENTS ARE VERY FAINTLY CONNECTED WITH THEM AND HAVE VERY LITTLE PARTICULAR KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR AFFAIRS WITH ALL THESE CONCESSIONS
851-131029-0040 TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE PERSONS ONLY WILL BE THE DEPOSITORY OF THE SAFETY INTEREST AND HAPPINESS OF EIGHT MILLIONS THAT IS TO SAY
851-131029-0041 OF TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY CONSTITUTENTS IN AN ASSEMBLY EXPOSED TO THE WHOLE FORCE OF EXECUTIVE INFLUENCE AND EXTENDING ITS AUTHORITY TO EVERY OBJECT OF LEGISLATION WITHIN A NATION WHOSE AFFAIRS
851-131029-0042 ARE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE DIVERSIFIED AND COMPLICATED YET IT IS VERY CERTAIN NOT ONLY THAT A VALUABLE PORTION OF FREEDOM HAS BEEN PRESERVED UNDER ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THAT THE DEFECTS IN THE BRITISH CODE ARE CHARGEABLE IN A VERY SMALL PROPORTION
