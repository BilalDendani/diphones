7337-89742-0000 TURN ABOUT THE THOUGHT OF LANYARD'S POCKET FLASH LAMP OFFERING ITSELF IMMEDIATELY ITS WIDE CIRCLE OF LIGHT ENVELOPED HIS LATE ANTAGONIST THAT ONE WAS RESTING ON A SHOULDER LEGS UNCOUTHLY A SPRAWL
7337-89742-0001 QUITE WITHOUT MOVEMENT OF ANY PERCEPTIBLE SORT HIS FACE MORE THAN HALF TURNED TO THE FLOOR AND MASKED INTO THE BARGAIN INCREDULOUSLY LANYARD STIRRED THE BODY WITH A FOOT HOLDING HIS WEAPON POISED AS THOUGH
7337-89742-0002 HALF EXPECTING IT TO QUICKEN WITH INSTANT AND VIOLENT ACTION BUT IT RESPONDED IN NO WAY WITH A NOD OF SATISFACTION HE SHIFTED THE LIGHT UNTIL IT MARKED DOWN THE NEAREST ELECTRIC BULB WHICH PROVED IN LINE WITH HIS INFERENCE
7337-89742-0003 TO HAVE BEEN EXTINGUISHED BY THE SOCKET KEY WHILE THE HEAT OF ITS BULB INDICATED THAT THE CURRENT HAD BEEN SHUT OFF ONLY AN INSTANT BEFORE HIS ENTRANCE THE LIGHT FULL UP
7337-89742-0004 KNELT AND LIFTING THE BODY TURNED IT UPON ITS BACK
7337-89742-0005 UPTURNED TO THE GLARE WAS THAT OF THE AMERICAN WHO HAD MADE A FOURTH IN THE CONCERT OF THE PACK MISTER SMITH QUICKLY UNLATCHING THE MASK LANYARD REMOVED IT BUT THE COUNTENANCE THUS EXPOSED TOLD LITTLE MORE THAN HE KNEW
7337-89742-0006 HE COULD HAVE SWORN HE HAD NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE NONE THE LESS SOMETHING IN ITS EVIL CAST PERSISTENTLY TROUBLED HIS MEMORY WITH THE SAME PROVOKING AND BAFFLING EFFECT THAT HAD ATTENDED THEIR FIRST ENCOUNTER
7337-89742-0007 ALREADY THE AMERICAN WAS STRUGGLING TOWARD CONSCIOUSNESS HIS LIPS AND EYELIDS TWITCHED SPASMODICALLY HE SHUDDERED AND HIS FLEXED MUSCLES BEGAN TO RELAX IN THIS PROCESS SOMETHING FELL FROM BETWEEN THE FINGERS OF HIS RIGHT HAND
7337-89742-0008 SOMETHING SMALL AND SILVER BRIGHT THAT CAUGHT LANYARD'S EYE PICKING IT UP HE EXAMINED WITH INTEREST A SMALL HYPODERMIC SYRINGE LOADED TO THE FULL CAPACITY OF ITS GLASS CYLINDER PLUNGER DRAWN BACK ALL READY FOR INSTANT SERVICE
7337-89742-0009 IT WAS THE NEEDLE OF THIS INSTRUMENT THAT HAD PRICKED THE SKIN OF LANYARD'S NECK BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT IT CONTAINED A SOPORIFIC IF NOT EXACTLY A KILLING DOSE OF SOME NARCOTIC DRUG COCAINE AT A VENTURE
7337-89742-0010 SO IT APPEARED THAT THIS AGENT OF THE PACK HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED TO PUT THE LONE WOLF TO SLEEP FOR AN HOUR OR TWO OR MORE PERHAPS NOT PERMANENTLY THAT HE MIGHT BE OUT OF THE WAY LONG ENOUGH FOR THEIR OCCULT PURPOSES
7337-89742-0011 TURN ABOUT HE REFLECTED IS SAID TO BE FAIR PLAY WELL WHY NOT HE BENT FORWARD
7337-89742-0012 ALL IN A SINGLE MOVEMENT SO SWIFT AND DEFT THAT THE DRUG WAS DELIVERED BEFORE THE PAIN COULD STARTLE THE VICTIM FROM HIS COMA AS FOR THAT THE MAN CAME TO QUICKLY ENOUGH
7337-89742-0013 BUT ONLY TO HAVE HIS CLEARING SENSES MET AND DASHED BY THE MUZZLE OF A PISTOL STAMPING A COLD RING UPON HIS TEMPLE LIE PERFECTLY QUIET MY DEAR MISTER SMITH LANYARD ADVISED DON'T SPEAK ABOVE A WHISPER GIVE THE GOOD DOPE A CHANCE
7337-89742-0014 IT'LL ONLY NEED A MOMENT OR I'M NO JUDGE AND YOU'RE A CARELESS HIGHBINDER I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOWEVER IF IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU BUT ALREADY THE INJECTION WAS TAKING EFFECT
7337-89742-0015 THE LOOK OF PANIC WHICH HAD DRAWN THE FEATURES OF THE AMERICAN AND FLICKERED FROM HIS EYES WITH DAWNING APPRECIATION OF HIS PLIGHT WAS CLOUDING FADING BLENDING INTO ONE OF DAZE AND STUPOUR THE EYELIDS FLICKERED AND LAY STILL
7337-89742-0016 A LONG CONVULSIVE SIGH SHOOK THE AMERICAN'S BODY AND HE RESTED WITH THE IMMOBILITY OF THE DEAD SAVE FOR THE SLOW BUT STEADY RISE AND FALL OF HIS BOSOM LANYARD THOUGHTFULLY REVIEWED THESE PHENOMENA
7337-89742-0017 MUST KICK LIKE A MULE THAT DOPE HE REFLECTED LUCKY IT DIDN'T GET ME BEFORE I GUESSED WHAT WAS UP IF I'D EVEN SUSPECTED ITS STRENGTH HOWEVER I'D HAVE BEEN LESS HASTY I COULD DO WITH A LITTLE INFORMATION FROM MISTER MYSTERIOUS STRANGER HERE
7337-89742-0018 SUDDENLY CONSCIOUS OF A DRY AND BURNING THROAT HE ROSE AND GOING TO THE WASHSTAND DRANK DEEP AND THIRSTILY FROM A WATER BOTTLE
7337-89742-0019 IN HIS ABSTRACTION HE WANDERED TO A CHAIR OVER WHOSE BACK HUNG A LIGHT DRESSING GOWN OF WINE COLOURED SILK WHICH BECAUSE IT WOULD PACK IN SMALL COMPASS WAS IN THE HABIT OF CARRYING WITH HIM ON HIS TRAVELS LANYARD HAD LEFT THIS THROWN ACROSS HIS BED
7337-89742-0020 AND HE WAS WONDERING SUBCONSCIOUSLY WHAT USE THE MAN HAD THOUGHT TO MAKE OF IT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO SHIFT IT TO THE CHAIR BUT EVEN AS HE LAID HOLD OF IT LANYARD DROPPED THE GARMENT IN SHEER SURPRISE TO FIND IT DAMP AND HEAVY IN HIS GRASP SODDEN WITH VISCID MOISTURE
7337-89742-0021 AND WHEN IN A SWIFT FLASH OF INTUITION HE EXAMINED HIS FINGERS HE DISCOVERED THEM DISCOLOURED WITH A FAINT REDDISH STAIN HAD THE DYE RUN AND HOW HAD THE AMERICAN COME TO DABBLE THE GARMENT IN WATER TO WHAT END THEN
7337-89742-0022 HE STARED INCREDULOUS MOVED FORWARD BENT OVER AND PICKED IT UP CLIPPING IT GINGERLY BETWEEN FINGER TIPS IT WAS ONE OF HIS RAZORS A HEAVY HOLLOW GROUND BLADE AND IT WAS FOUL WITH BLOOD
7337-89742-0023 WITH A LOW CRY SMITTEN WITH AWFUL UNDERSTANDING LANYARD WHEELED AND STARED FEARFULLY AT THE DOOR COMMUNICATING WITH RODDY'S ROOM IT STOOD AJAR AN INCH OR TWO
7337-89742-0024 BEYOND THE DOOR DARKNESS SILENCE MUSTERING UP ALL HIS COURAGE THE ADVENTURER STRODE DETERMINEDLY INTO THE ADJOINING ROOM
7337-89742-0025 THE FIRST FLASH OF HIS HAND LAMP DISCOVERED TO HIM SICKENING VERIFICATION OF HIS MOST DREADFUL APPREHENSIONS NOW HE SAW WHY HIS DRESSING GOWN HAD BEEN REQUISITIONED TO PROTECT A BUTCHER'S CLOTHING AFTER A MOMENT HE RETURNED SHUT THE DOOR
7337-89742-0026 AND SET HIS BACK AGAINST IT AS IF TO BAR OUT THAT REEKING SHAMBLES HE WAS VERY PALE HIS FACE DRAWN WITH HORROR AND HE WAS POWERFULLY SHAKEN WITH NAUSEA THE PLOT WAS DAMNABLY PATENT
7337-89742-0027 RODDY PROVING A MENACE TO THE PACK AND REQUIRING ELIMINATION HIS MURDER HAD BEEN DECREED AS WELL AS THAT THE BLAME FOR IT SHOULD BE LAID AT LANYARD'S DOOR
7337-89742-0028 THAT HE MIGHT NOT ESCAPE BEFORE POLICE COULD BE SENT TO FIND HIM THERE HE COULD NO LONGER DOUBT THAT DE MORBIHAN HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND AT THE CIRCLE OF FRIENDS OF HARMONY SOLELY TO DETAIN HIM IF NEED BE AND AFFORD SMITH TIME TO FINISH HIS HIDEOUS JOB AND SET THE TRAP FOR THE SECOND VICTIM
7337-89742-0029 AND THE PLOT HAD SUCCEEDED DESPITE ITS PARTIAL FAILURE DESPITE THE SWIFT REVERSE CHANCE AND LANYARD'S CUNNING HAD METED OUT TO THE PACK'S AGENT IT WAS HIS DRESSING GOWN THAT WAS SATURATE WITH RODDY'S BLOOD JUST AS THEY WERE HIS GLOVES PILFERED FROM HIS LUGGAGE
7337-89742-0030 WHICH HAD MEASURABLY PROTECTED THE KILLER'S HANDS AND WHICH LANYARD HAD FOUND IN THE NEXT ROOM STRIPPED HASTILY OFF AND THROWN TO THE FLOOR TWIN CRUMPLED WADS OF BLOOD STAINED CHAMOIS SKIN
7337-89742-0031 OR ELSE SEEK DE MORBIHAN AND SOLICIT HIS PROTECTION HIS BOASTED INFLUENCE IN HIGH QUARTERS BUT TO GIVE HIMSELF INTO THE HANDS TO BECOME AN ASSOCIATE OF ONE WHO COULD BE PARTY TO SO COWARDLY A CRIME AS THIS
7337-89742-0032 LANYARD TOLD HIMSELF HE WOULD SOONER PAY THE GUILLOTINE THE PENALTY CONSULTING HIS WATCH HE FOUND THE HOUR TO BE NO LATER THAN HALF PAST FOUR SO SWIFTLY
7337-89742-0033 EVENTS HAD MOVED SINCE THE INCIDENT OF THE SOMNAMBULIST
7337-89742-0034 NOVEMBER NIGHTS ARE LONG AND BLACK IN PARIS IT WOULD HARDLY BE EVEN MODERATELY LIGHT BEFORE SEVEN O'CLOCK BUT THAT WERE A RESPITE NONE TOO LONG FOR LANYARD'S NECESSITY
7337-89742-0035 HE MUST THINK SWIFTLY IN CONTEMPLATION OF INSTANT ACTION WERE HE TO EXTRICATE HIMSELF WITHOUT THE PACK'S KNOWLEDGE AND CONSENT GRANTED THEN HE MUST FLY THIS STRICKEN FIELD OF PARIS BUT HOW DE MORBIHAN HAD PROMISED THAT POPINOT'S CREATURES WOULD GUARD EVERY OUTLET AND LANYARD DIDN'T DOUBT HIM
7337-89742-0036 AN ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE THE CITY BY ANY ORDINARY CHANNEL WOULD BE TO INVITE EITHER DENUNCIATION TO THE POLICE ON THE CHARGE OF MURDER OR ONE OF THOSE FATALLY EXPEDITIOUS FORMS OF ASSASSINATION OF WHICH THE APACHES ARE PAST MASTERS HE MUST AND WOULD FIND ANOTHER WAY
7337-89742-0037 BUT HIS DECISION WAS FRIGHTFULLY HAMPERED BY LACK OF READY MONEY THE FEW ODD FRANCS IN HIS POCKET WERE NO STORE FOR THE WAR CHEST DEMANDED BY THIS EMERGENCY TRUE HE HAD THE OMBER JEWELS BUT THEY WERE NOT NEGOTIABLE NOT AT LEAST IN PARIS AND THE HUYSMAN PLANS
7337-89742-0038 THUNDERSTRUCK BY SOMETHING HE THOUGHT TO DETECT IN THE COUNTERFEIT PRESENTMENT OF HIS COUNTENANCE HEAVY WITH FATIGUE AS IT WAS AND HAGGARD WITH CONTEMPLATION OF THIS APPALLING CONTRETEMPS AND INSTANTLY HE WAS BACK BESIDE THE AMERICAN STUDYING NARROWLY THE CONTOURS OF THAT LIVID MASK
7337-89742-0039 HERE THEN WAS THAT RESEMBLANCE WHICH HAD BAFFLED HIM AND NOW THAT HE SAW IT HE COULD NOT DENY THAT IT WAS UNFLATTERINGLY CLOSE FEATURE FOR FEATURE THE FACE OF THE MURDERER REPRODUCED HIS FACE
7337-89742-0040 COARSENED PERHAPS BUT RECOGNIZABLY A REPLICA OF THAT MICHAEL LANYARD WHO CONFRONTED HIM EVERY MORNING IN HIS SHAVING GLASS ALMOST THE ONLY DIFFERENCE RESIDING IN THE SCRUBBY BLACK MOUSTACHE THAT SHADOWED THE AMERICAN'S UPPER LIP
7337-89742-0041 BEFORE RISING HE TURNED OUT THE POCKETS OF HIS COUNTERFEIT BUT THIS PROFITED HIM LITTLE THE ASSASSIN HAD DRESSED FOR ACTION WITH FORETHOUGHT TO EVADE RECOGNITION IN EVENT OF ACCIDENT LANYARD COLLECTED ONLY A CHEAP AMERICAN WATCH
7337-89742-0042 A BRIQUET A COMMON KEY THAT MIGHT FIT ANY HOTEL DOOR
7337-89742-0043 NOTHING WHATEVER THAT WOULD SERVE AS A MARK OF IDENTIFICATION FOR THOUGH THE GREY CLOTHING WAS TAILOR MADE THE MAKER'S LABELS HAD BEEN RIPPED OUT OF ITS POCKETS WHILE THE MAN'S LINEN AND UNDERWEAR ALIKE LACKED EVEN A LAUNDRY'S HIEROGLYPHIC
7337-89742-0044 WITH THIS HARVEST OF NOTHING FOR HIS PAINS LANYARD TURNED AGAIN TO THE WASH STAND AND HIS SHAVING KIT MIXED A STIFF LATHER STROPPED ANOTHER RAZOR TO THE FINEST EDGE HE COULD MANAGE FETCHED A PAIR OF KEEN SCISSORS FROM HIS DRESSING CASE AND WENT BACK TO THE MURDERER
7337-89742-0045 HE WORKED RAPIDLY AT A HIGH PITCH OF EXCITEMENT AS MUCH THROUGH SHEER DESPERATION AS THROUGH ANY APPEAL INHERENT IN THE SCHEME EITHER TO HIS COMMON SENSE OR TO HIS ROMANTIC BENT IN TWO MINUTES HE HAD STRIPPED THE MOUSTACHE CLEAN AWAY FROM THAT STUPID FLACCID MASK
7337-89742-0046 UNQUESTIONABLY THE RESEMBLANCE WAS NOW MOST STRIKING THE AMERICAN WOULD READILY PASS FOR MICHAEL LANYARD THIS MUCH ACCOMPLISHED HE PURSUED HIS PREPARATIONS IN FEVERISH HASTE IN SPITE OF THIS HE OVERLOOKED NO DETAIL
7337-89742-0047 IN LESS THAN TWENTY MINUTES HE HAD EXCHANGED CLOTHING WITH THE AMERICAN IN DETAIL EVEN DOWN TO SHIRTS COLLARS AND NECKTIES HAD PACKED IN HIS OWN POCKETS THE SEVERAL ARTICLES TAKEN FROM THE OTHER TOGETHER WITH THE JOINTED JIMMY AND A FEW OF HIS PERSONAL EFFECTS
7337-89742-0048 AND WAS READY TO BID ADIEU TO HIMSELF TO THAT MICHAEL LANYARD WHOM PARIS KNEW THE INSENTIENT MASQUERADER ON THE FLOOR HAD CALLED HIMSELF GOOD ENOUGH SMITH
7337-89742-0049 AS GOOD ENOUGH LANYARD AT LEAST FOR THE LONE WOLF'S PURPOSES THE POLICE AT ALL EVENTS WOULD ACCEPT HIM AS SUCH
7337-89742-0050 THROUGH THIS PERFUNCTORY DECEASE THE LONE WOLF WOULD GAIN A FREEDOM EVEN GREATER THAN BEFORE THE PACK HAD CONTRIVED ONLY TO ELIMINATE MICHAEL LANYARD THE AMATEUR OF FINE PAINTINGS REMAINED THE LONE WOLF WITH NOT ONE FACULTY IMPAIRED
7337-89742-0051 BUT RATHER WITH A DEADLIER PURPOSE TO SHAPE HIS OCCULT COURSES UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HIS METHODICAL PREPARATIONS HIS EMOTIONS HAD COOLED APPRECIABLY TAKING ON A CAST OF COLD MALIGNANT VENGEFULNESS HE
7337-89742-0052 WHO NEVER IN ALL HIS CRIMINAL RECORD HAD SO MUCH AS PULLED TRIGGER IN SELF DEFENCE
7337-89742-0053 WITH THE MOST COLD BLOODED INTENT GIVEN ONE OF THREE TARGETS WHILE POPINOT'S CREATURES IF THEY WORRIED HIM HE MEANT TO EXTERMINATE WITH AS LITTLE COMPUNCTION
7337-89742-0054 HE STEPPED QUICKLY TO A WINDOW AND FROM ONE EDGE OF ITS SHADE LOOKED DOWN INTO THE STREET HE WAS IN TIME TO SEE A STUNTED HUMAN SILHOUETTE DETACH ITSELF FROM THE SHADOW OF A DOORWAY ON THE OPPOSITE WALK MOVE TO THE CURB AND WAVE AN ARM
7337-89742-0055 EVIDENTLY SIGNALING ANOTHER SENTINEL ON A CORNER OUT OF LANYARD'S RANGE OF VISION HEREIN WAS ADDITIONAL PROOF IF ANY LACKED THAT DE MORBIHAN HAD NOT EXAGGERATED THE DISPOSITION OF POPINOT THIS ANIMAL IN THE STREET
7337-89742-0056 MOMENTARILY REVEALED BY THE CORNER LIGHT AS HE DARTED ACROSS TO TAKE POSITION BY THE DOOR THIS ANIMAL WITH SICKLY FACE AND POINTED CHIN WITH DIRTY MUFFLER ROUND ITS CHICKEN NECK SHODDY COAT CLOTHING ITS SLOPING SHOULDERS
7337-89742-0057 BAGGY CORDUROY TROUSERS FLAPPING ROUND ITS BONY SHANKS THIS WAS POPINOT'S AND BUT ONE OF A THOUSAND DIFFERING IN NO ESSENTIAL SAVE DEGREE OF VICIOUSNESS
7337-89742-0058 IN CO OPERATION WITH RODDY'S MURDERER
7337-89742-0059 BUT THE ADVENTURER WAS SATISFIED THAT IN HIS PROPER GUISE AS HIMSELF HE NEEDED ONLY TO OPEN THAT POSTERN DOOR AT THE STREET END OF THE PASSAGE TO FEEL A KNIFE SLIP IN BETWEEN HIS RIBS
7337-89742-0060 MOST PROBABLY IN HIS BACK BENEATH THE SHOULDER BLADE HE NODDED GRIMLY
