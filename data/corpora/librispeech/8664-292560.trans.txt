8664-292560-0000 CAME DEAD ON FOR THE WILDEST PART OF OUR COAST THE FIERCE HEADLAND THAT LIES BACK OF THE OLD CASTLE ROCK THE SOUND SIGNAL WAS FIRED AND CHARLIE AND HIS BRAVE COMRADES WENT OUT TO HER
8664-292560-0001 SHE WAS REELING ON THE TOP OF A TREMENDOUS SEA AND THERE WAS NO COMING NEAR TO HER SIDE IT WAS AN AWFUL TASK TO GET THE CREW ABOARD THE LIFEBOAT BUT CHARLIE SAVED EVERY SOUL AND LOST NOT A HAND OF HIS OWN
8664-292560-0002 WHEN THE TRAVELLER WAS RIGGED AND THE BREECHES WERE READY AND THE CREW OF THE DOOMED SHIP WERE AT THE BULWARKS WAITING TO LEAVE HER CHARLIE SANG OUT OVER THE CLAMOUR OF THE SEA
8664-292560-0003 TWENTY FOUR CAME BACK AS ANSWER THEN CHARLIE CRIED
8664-292560-0004 THE OTHER MAN IS HURT HE'S DYING NO USE SAVING HIM THE NORSEMAN SHOUTED YOU'LL BRING THE DYING MAN ON DECK BEFORE A SOUL OF YOU LEAVES THE SHIP CRIED CHARLIE
8664-292560-0005 THERE WAS A WOMAN AMONG THEM AND WHEN THE CARPENTER CAME SCUDDING DOWN THE ROPE HE HAD A CANVAS BAG ON HIS BACK NO TOOLS HERE SHOUTED CHARLIE IT'S THE CHILD SAID THE MAN
8664-292560-0006 THE CAPTAIN CAME NEXT HE HAD LEFT EVERYTHING ELSE BEHIND HIM HIS MONEY HIS INSTRUMENTS HIS CLOTHES HIS SHIP
8664-292560-0007 BUT TO SEE IT IN ALL ITS SPLENDOUR YOU MUST HAVE A DROP OF OUR MANX BLOOD IN YOU OUR FOREFATHERS WERE FROM NORWAY OUR FIRST NORSE KING WAS NAMED GORRY HE LANDED ON THIS ISLAND NOT FAR FROM THIS SPOT
8664-292560-0008 AND ON THAT DAY OF THE WRECK OF THE SAINT GEORGE HIS CHILDREN'S CHILDREN RESCUED FROM THE SEA THE CHILDREN'S CHILDREN OF THE KINSMEN HE HAD LEFT AT HOME MOST OF OUR MEN HAD NORSE NAMES ONE OF THEM WAS A GORRY
8664-292560-0009 LINEAL DESCENDANT BEYOND DOUBT OF THE OLD SEA KING THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT FELT THE TOUCH OF GREAT THINGS IN THIS INCIDENT IT WAS NOT MERELY THAT THE BRAVERY OF THE RESCUE FIRED THEIR GRATITUDE SOMETHING CALLED TO THEM FROM THAT DEEP PLACE
8664-292560-0010 WHERE BLOOD ANSWERS TO THE CRY OF BLOOD THEY SENT MEDALS FOR CHARLIE AND HIS CREW AND THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND DISTRIBUTED THEM INSIDE THE ROOFLESS WALLS OF THE OLD CASTLE OF THE BLACK DOG IT WAS LIKE GRASPING HANDS WITH THE PAST ACROSS
8664-292560-0011 THE SPACE OF A THOUSAND YEARS THE OTHER DAY WE HAD ANOTHER GREAT WIND AND ANOTHER BRAVE RESCUE THE SUN HAD GONE DOWN OVERNIGHT IN A SULLEN RED VERY FIERCE AND ANGRY IN HIS SETTING
8664-292560-0012 AND OUT OF THE BLACK NORTH EAST THE STORM HAD COME UP WHILE WE SLEPT IN THE HEAVY GREY OF THE DAWN THE SOUND SIGNAL FIRED ITS DOUBLE SHOT OVER OUR LITTLE TOWN A WELSH SCHOONER WHICH HAD RUN IN FOR SHELTER DURING THE DARK HOURS
8664-292560-0013 WAS RIDING TO AN ANCHOR IN THE BAY AND FLYING HER ENSIGN FOR HELP THE SEA WAS TERRIFIC A SLATY GREY STREAKED WITH WHITE FOAM LIKE QUARTZ VEINS IT WAS COMING OVER THE BREAKWATER IN SHEETS THAT HID IT
8664-292560-0014 THE WHITE SEA FOWL WERE LIKE DARK SPECKS DARTING THROUGH IT BUT NO HUMAN EAR COULD HEAR THE CRY OF THEIR THOUSAND THROATS IN THE THUNDEROUS QUAKE OF THE BREAKERS ON THE CAVERNOUS ROCKS A CROWD OF MEN ANSWERED THE CALL
8664-292560-0015 AND THERE WAS NO SHORTNESS OF HANDS TO MAN THE LIFEBOAT
8664-292560-0016 WHEN THE SEA WAS CALM WERE STRUGGLING CHAFING AND QUARRELLING TO GO OUT ON IT NOW THAT IT WAS IN STORM
8664-292560-0017 THE CREW OF THE WELSHMAN WERE BROUGHT ASHORE THEN THE ABANDONED SCHOONER RODE THREE HOURS LONGER IN THE GALE AND A HUNDRED MEN STOOD AND WATCHED HER TALKING OF OTHER WINDS AND OTHER WRECKS AND OF PEEL BOYS WHO WERE OUT ON THE SEA
8664-292560-0018 AT LAST THE SHIP PARTED HER CABLES AND WENT ROLLING LIKE A BLINDED PORPOISE DEAD ON FOR THE JAGGED COAST SEVEN MEN TOOK AN OPEN FISHING BOAT AND WENT AFTER HER AND WE CLIMBED THE HEAD TO LOOK AT THEM THE WIND SMOTE US THERE LIKE AN INVISIBLE WING
8664-292560-0019 SOMETIMES SWIRLING US OUT OF OUR COURSE OFTEN BRINGING US TO OUR KNEES AND WHIPPING OUR EARS WITH OUR HAIR LIKE RODS SHEETS OF SPRAY WERE COMING UP TO US FROM BELOW AND RUNNING ALONG THE CLIFFS LIKE DRIVEN RAIN
8664-292560-0020 THE SUN WHICH HAD BROKEN IN FIERCE BRILLIANCE FROM A GREEN RENT IN THE SKY MADE RAINBOWS IN THE FLYING FOAM FROM THE HEIGHTS WE WATCHED THE SEVEN MEN AND THE OPEN BOAT THEY ROSE AND FELL APPEARED AND DISAPPEARED
8664-292560-0021 BUT THEY OVERTOOK THE WELSHMAN BEFORE SHE HAD DRIFTED ON TO THE COAST BOARDED HER WITH DIFFICULTY LET GO ANOTHER ANCHOR AND MADE HER TIGHT THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO FOR SHE WAS DISABLED AND HER SAILS WERE TORN TO SHREDS
8664-292560-0022 THE NEW ANCHOR HELD THE SHIP AN HOUR LONGER AND THEN THERE WAS NO HELP LEFT FOR HER SHE WAS WITHIN A HUNDRED FEET OF THE ROCKS AND SHE FELL ON THEM WITH THE GROAN OF A LIVING CREATURE THE INSTANT HER HEAD WAS DOWN THE WHITE LIONS OF THE SEA LEAPT OVER HER
8664-292560-0023 THE WATER SWIRLED THROUGH HER BULWARKS AND PLUNGED DOWN HER HATCH HER HELM WAS UNSHIPPED HER SAILS WERE TORN FROM THEIR GASKETS AND THE FLOATING HOME WHEREIN MEN HAD SAILED AND SUNG AND SLEPT AND LAUGHED
8664-292560-0024 AND JESTED WAS A BROKEN WRECK IN THE HEAVY WALLOWINGS OF THE WAVES WHEN IT WAS OVER AND WE WERE COMING BACK DRENCHED THROUGH AND GREEN WITH THE DRIFT OF THE SEA FOAM CAKED THICK ON OUR FACES SOME OF US BEGAN TO THINK OF CHARLIE
8664-292560-0025 HE HAD NOT BEEN THERE THAT DAY A YEAR OR MORE AGO IN THE PRIME OF A SPLENDID MANHOOD HE WAS STRICKEN BY HEART DISEASE HE KEPT A GOOD HEART NEVERTHELESS AND BY INDOMITABLE WILL HELD ON FOR SOME TIME FIRST A LITTLE WORK
8664-292560-0026 THEN NO WORK AT ALL ONLY A SAIL NOW AND THEN IF THE SEA WAS CALM BUT OF LATE HARDLY EVER WELL ENOUGH TO TAKE THE OPEN AIR
8664-292560-0027 HE HAD NOT ANSWERED THE SIGNAL FOR THE LIFEBOAT BUT HE HAD HEARD IT IN THE FIERCE LIGHT OF MORNING AND THEY COULD NOT KEEP HIM IN BED THE SOUL OF THE OLD SEA DOG LEAPT TO THE CALL BUT HIS AILING BODY HELD HIM DOWN HE WANTED TO GO OUT
8664-292560-0028 HE COULD HEAR EVERYTHING AND SEE A GOOD DEAL OFTEN HE COULD HARDLY KEEP HIMSELF FROM CRYING AND SHOUTING ALOUD IN SPIRIT HE WAS OUT ON THE BOILING SURF DIPPING RISING STOOPING GOING OVER RIGHTING AGAIN
8664-292560-0029 CLAMBERING BACK EXULTING GLORYING GETTING NEARER THE SHIP STANDING OFF HER RIGGING THE TRAVELLER AND FETCHING MEN ABOARD IN THE BREECHES AND THEN AWAY FROM THE ROLLING HULK AND SING HO MY LADS
8664-292560-0030 AND HAUL THROUGH THE WHITE WAVES FOR HOME BUT HIS POOR DYING BODY WAS DOWN ON THE BED AND HIS FACE WAS SICKLY SCARLET
8664-292560-0031 HE DIED LATER AFTER THE GREAT WIND THERE CAME A GREAT CALM THE AIR WAS QUIET AND FULL OF THE ODOUR OF SEAWEED BANKS OF SEAWEED WERE ON THE SHORE AND THE BROKEN SCHOONER WAS COVERED WITH BROWN WRACK
8664-292560-0032 LIKE ANY ROCK OF THE COAST THE SKY WAS ROUND AS THE INSIDE OF A SHELL AND PALE PINK LIKE THE SHADOW OF FLAME THE WATER WAS SMOOTH AND LAND AND SEA LAY LIKE A SLEEPING CHILD IN THIS BROAD AND STEADY WEATHER
8664-292560-0033 OUR LITTLE TOWN WAS STARTLED BY THE DOUBLE SHOT AGAIN WE WENT TO THE WINDOWS IN SURPRISE AND SAW THE RED FLAG OVER THE ROCKET HOUSE WHICH IS THE SIGNAL FOR THE LIFEBOAT CHARLIE WAS DEAD HE HAD JUST BREATHED HIS LAST
8664-292560-0034 BUT ARE POETS NEVERTHELESS TO THE DEEPEST GRAIN OF THEM HAD RUN UP THE FLAG MAST HIGH NOT HALF MAST AS SIGNAL TO THE GREAT COX OF ALL THAT HERE WAS A SOUL IN THE TROUBLED WATERS OF DEATH WAITING FOR THE EVERLASTING LIFEBOAT
8664-292560-0035 CHARLIE IT DID NOT TAKE NOT SO SURE IS IT THAT HE WHO LIVES BY THE SWORD WILL PERISH BY THE SWORD AS THAT HE WHO BAULKS THE SEA THE SEA WILL SURELY HAVE FOR ITS PREY
8664-292560-0036 BUT HE HAS GONE TO SLEEP ON THE LAND WE BURIED HIM TO DAY IN THE LITTLE CEMETERY LOOKING ON TO THE GREY WATER THAT WAS MORE THAN HALF HIS ELEMENT THE FUNERAL WAS BEAUTIFUL IN ITS OLD SIMPLICITY
8664-292560-0037 FIRST A HYMN AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE IN THE LITTLE ALLEY BY THE BEACH SAFE IN THE ARMS OF JESUS WITH THE COFFIN ON THE GROUND AND ALL STANDING ROUND THE SEA QUIET
8664-292560-0038 HARDLY A BREEZE AS SOFT AS HUMAN BREATH MOVING ITS TRANQUIL SURFACE THE DEADLY RIVAL IN ITS EVERLASTING COMING AND GOING MAKING NO TRIUMPHANT CLAMOUR NOW THE SEA WARRIOR WAS DOWN
8664-292560-0039 THEN THE COMPANIONS OF HIS DANGERS THE CREW OF HIS BOAT A GROUP OF STALWART FELLOWS WHO HAVE NEVER KNOWN WHAT IT IS TO BE AFRAID CARRYING HIM UP THE HILL SHOULDER HIGH EACH IN HIS RED STOCKING CAP AND HIS LIFE BELT
8664-292560-0040 EMBLEMS OF HOW THEY HAD FOUGHT THE SEA AND BEATEN IT THERE WERE SOME OF US WHOSE EYES WERE WET BUT IF THESE BRAVE BOYS WEPT AT ALL IT WAS ONLY FOR THE HELPLESS LITTLE ONES LEFT BEHIND FOR CHARLIE THEY DID NOT WEEP
8664-292560-0041 HIS SPIRIT IS NOT DEAD FOR THEM IT CANNOT DIE WHEN BRAVE DEEDS HAVE TO BE DONE THEY WILL SEE ITS LIGHT LIKE A BEACON THAT DOES NOT FAIL OVER THE MOUNTAINS OF THE FIERCEST STORM
8664-292560-0042 THEY WILL HEAR ITS VOICE ABOVE THE THUNDER OF THE LOUDEST WAVES A FULL MOON IS SHINING TO NIGHT ON THE PLACE OF CHARLIE'S REST AND IF THE OLD NORSE STORY IS TRUE THAT WHILE THE BODY LIES IN SIGHT OF THE SEA THE SPIRIT LIVES IN THE WINDS ABOVE IT
