3144-166428-0000 A KEENING BARRIER AGAINST THE AVALANCHE OF THE THUNDER THE BLAST BENT US FAR BACK ON THIGHS HELD RIGID BY THE MAGNETIC GRIP THE PONY SPREAD ITS LEGS DROPPED ITS HEAD
3144-166428-0001 THROUGH THE HURRICANE ROARING ITS SCREAMING PIERCED THINLY THAT AGONIZING TERRIBLE LAMENTATION WHICH IS OF THE HORSE AND THE HORSE ALONE WHEN THE LIMIT OF ITS ENDURANCE IS REACHED VENTNOR CROUCHED LOWER AND LOWER
3144-166428-0002 EYES SHIELDED BEHIND ARMS FOLDED OVER HIS BROWS STRAINING FOR A GLIMPSE OF RUTH DRAKE CROUCHED BESIDE HIM BRACING HIM SUPPORTING HIM AGAINST THE TEMPEST OUR LINE OF FLIGHT BECAME LESS ABRUPT
3144-166428-0003 BUT THE SPEED INCREASED THE WIND PRESSURE BECAME ALMOST INSUPPORTABLE I TWISTED DROPPED UPON MY RIGHT ARM THRUST MY HEAD AGAINST MY SHOULDER STARED BACKWARD
3144-166428-0004 WHEN FIRST I HAD LOOKED UPON THE PLACE I HAD SENSED ITS IMMENSITY NOW I BEGAN TO REALIZE HOW VAST IT MUST REALLY BE FOR ALREADY THE GATEWAY THROUGH WHICH WE HAD COME GLIMMERED FAR AWAY ON HIGH
3144-166428-0005 SHRUNK TO A HOOP OF INCANDESCENT BRASS AND DWINDLING FAST NOR WAS IT A CAVERN I SAW THE STARS TRACED WITH DEEP RELIEF THE FAMILIAR NORTHERN CONSTELLATIONS PIT IT MIGHT BE
3144-166428-0006 BUT WHATEVER TERROR WHATEVER ORDEALS WERE BEFORE US WE WOULD NOT HAVE TO FACE THEM BURIED DEEP WITHIN EARTH THERE WAS A CURIOUS COMFORT TO ME IN THE THOUGHT SUDDENLY STARS AND SKY WERE BLOTTED OUT
3144-166428-0007 WE HAD PLUNGED BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE RADIANT SEA LYING IN THE POSITION IN WHICH I WAS I WAS SENSIBLE OF A DIMINUTION OF THE CYCLONIC FORCE THE BLAST STREAMED UP AND OVER THE FRONT OF THE CUBE
3144-166428-0008 TO ME DRIFTED ONLY THE WAILINGS OF OUR FLIGHT AND THE WHIMPERING TERROR OF THE PONY I TURNED MY HEAD CAUTIOUSLY UPON THE VERY EDGE OF THE FLYING BLOCKS SQUATTED DRAKE AND VENTNOR
3144-166428-0009 GROTESQUELY FROG LIKE I CRAWLED TOWARD THEM CRAWLED LITERALLY
3144-166428-0010 THAT WHATEVER THEIR ACTIVATION THEIR LIFE THEY WERE METAL THERE WAS NO MISTAKING NOW THE TESTIMONY OF TOUCH METAL THEY WERE WITH A HINT UPON CONTACT OF HIGHLY POLISHED PLATINUM
3144-166428-0011 ALSO THEY HAD TEMPERATURE A CURIOUSLY PLEASANT WARMTH THE SURFACES WERE I JUDGED AROUND NINETY FIVE DEGREES FAHRENHEIT
3144-166428-0012 I KNEW ORGANS OF SIGHT THEY WERE LIKE THE POINTS OF CONTACT OF INNUMERABLE INTERSECTING CRYSTAL PLANES THEY HELD STRANGEST PARADOXICAL SUGGESTION OF BEING CLOSE TO THE SURFACE AND STILL INFINITE DISTANCES AWAY AND THEY WERE LIKE
3144-166428-0013 WHAT WAS IT THEY WERE LIKE IT CAME TO ME WITH A DISTINCT SHOCK THEY WERE LIKE THE GALAXIES OF LITTLE AUREATE AND SAPPHIRE STARS IN THE CLEAR GRAY HEAVENS OF NORHALA'S EYES I CREPT BESIDE DRAKE STRUCK HIM WITH MY HEAD
3144-166428-0014 CAN'T LIFT MY HANDS STUCK FAST LIKE A FLY JUST AS YOU SAID DRAG EM OVER YOUR KNEES HE CRIED BENDING TO ME IT SLIDES EM OUT OF THE ATTRACTION
3144-166428-0015 ACTING AS HE HAD SUGGESTED I FOUND TO MY ASTONISHMENT I COULD SLIP MY HANDS FREE I CAUGHT HIS BELT TRIED TO LIFT MYSELF BY IT NO USE DOC THE OLD GRIN LIGHTENED FOR A MOMENT
3144-166428-0016 HIS TENSE YOUNG FACE YOU'LL HAVE TO KEEP PRAYING TILL THE POWER'S TURNED OFF NOTHING HERE YOU CAN SLIDE YOUR KNEES ON I NODDED WADDLING CLOSE TO HIS SIDE THEN SANK BACK ON MY HAUNCHES
3144-166428-0017 TO RELIEVE THE STRAIN UPON MY ACHING LEG MUSCLES CAN YOU SEE THEM AHEAD WALTER RUTH AND THE WOMAN VENTNOR TURNED HIS ANXIOUS EYES TOWARD ME I PEERED INTO THE GLIMMERING MURK SHOOK MY HEAD I COULD SEE NOTHING
3144-166428-0018 IT WAS INDEED AS THOUGH THE CLUSTERED CUBES SPED WITHIN A BUBBLE OF THE NOW WANLY GLISTENING VAPORS OR RATHER AS THOUGH IN OUR PASSAGE AS A PROJECTILE DOES IN AIR WE PILED BEFORE US
3144-166428-0019 A THICK WAVE OF THE MISTS WHICH STREAMING ALONG EACH SIDE CLOSING IN BEHIND OBSCURED ALL THAT LAY AROUND YET I HAD PERSISTENTLY THE FEELING THAT BEYOND THESE SHROUDINGS WAS VAST AND ORDERED MOVEMENT
3144-166428-0020 MARCHINGS AND COUNTER MARCHINGS OF HOSTS GREATER EVEN THAN THOSE GOLDEN HORDES OF GENGHIS WHICH AGES AGONE HAD WASHED ABOUT THE OUTER BASES OF THE VERY PEAKS THAT HID THIS PLACE CAME TOO
3144-166428-0021 RHYTHMIC TERRIFYING
3144-166428-0022 POISED FOR THE SIGNAL WHICH WOULD SEND THEM POURING OVER IT ONCE AGAIN I SEEMED TO STAND UPON THE BRINK OF AN ABYSS OF INCREDIBLE REVELATION STRIVING HELPLESSLY STRUGGLING FOR REALIZATION
3144-166428-0023 AND SO STRUGGLING BECAME AWARE THAT OUR SPEED WAS SWIFTLY SLACKENING THE ROARING BLAST DYING DOWN THE VEILS BEFORE US THINNING THEY CLEARED AWAY I SAW DRAKE AND VENTNOR STRAIGHTEN UP
3144-166428-0024 ITS MISTILY OUTLINED EDGES IMPINGING UPON THE TOWERING SCARP OF THE CITY IT WAS AS THOUGH BEFORE US LAY UPON ITS SIDE A CONE OF CRYSTALLINE CLEAR AIR AGAINST WHOSE CURVED SIDES
3144-166428-0025 PRESSED THE TOP ARC OF ITS PROSTRATE BASE REACHED A THOUSAND FEET OR MORE UP THE PRECIPITOUS WALL ABOVE IT ALL WAS HIDDEN IN SPARKLING NEBULOSITIES
3144-166428-0026 INFINITE DISTANCES THROUGH THEM SUDDENLY THOUSANDS OF BRIGHT BEAMS BEGAN TO DART TO DANCE WEAVING AND INTERWEAVING SHOOTING HITHER AND YON LIKE MYRIADS OF GREAT SEARCHLIGHTS IN A PHOSPHORESCENT SEA FOG
3144-166428-0027 LIKE COUNTLESS LANCES OF THE AURORA THRUSTING THROUGH ITS OWN IRIDESCENT VEILS AND IN THE PLAY OF THESE BEAMS WAS SOMETHING APPALLINGLY ORDERED APPALLINGLY RHYTHMIC IT WAS
3144-166428-0028 PURPOSEFUL PURPOSEFUL AS THE GEOMETRIC SHIFTINGS OF THE LITTLE THINGS OF THE RUINS OF THE SUMMONING SONG OF NORHALA OF THE PROTEAN CHANGES OF THE SMITING SHAPE AND THE FOLLOWING THING AND LIKE ALL OF THESE
3144-166428-0029 IT WAS AS LADEN WITH THAT BAFFLING CERTAINTY OF HIDDEN MEANINGS OF MESSAGES THAT THE BRAIN RECOGNIZED AS SUCH YET KNEW IT NEVER COULD READ THE RAYS SEEMED TO SPRING UPWARD FROM THE EARTH
3144-166428-0030 NOW THEY WERE LIKE COUNTLESS LANCES OF LIGHT BORNE BY MARCHING ARMIES OF TITANS
3144-166428-0031 WHILE THROUGH THEM THRUSTING THEM ASIDE BENDING THEM PASSED VAST VAGUE SHAPES LIKE MOUNTAINS FORMING AND DISSOLVING LIKE DARKENING MONSTERS OF SOME WORLD OF LIGHT PUSHING THROUGH THICK FORESTS OF SLENDER HIGH REACHING TREES OF COLD FLAME
3144-166428-0032 SHIFTING SHADOWS OF MONSTROUS CHIMERAE SLIPPING THROUGH JUNGLES OF BAMBOO WITH TRUNKS OF DIAMOND FIRE PHANTASMAL LEVIATHANS SWIMMING THROUGH BRAKES OF GIANT REEDS OF RADIANCE
3144-166428-0033 RISING FROM THE SPARKING OOZE OF A SEA OF STAR SHINE WHENCE CAME THE FORCE THE MECHANISM THAT PRODUCED THIS CONE OF CLARITY THIS NOT SEARCHLIGHT BUT UNLIGHT IN THE MIDST OF LIGHT
3144-166428-0034 NOT FROM BEHIND THAT WAS CERTAIN FOR TURNING I SAW THAT BEHIND US THE MIST WAS AS THICK I TURNED AGAIN IT CAME TO ME WHY I KNEW NOT YET WITH AN ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT THE ENERGY THE FORCE EMANATED
3144-166428-0035 WAS SMOOTH UTTERLY BLANK UPON IT WAS NO TRACE OF THOSE FLITTING LIGHTS WE HAD SEEN BEFORE WE HAD PLUNGED DOWN TOWARD THE RADIANT SEA IT SHONE WITH A PALE BLUE PHOSPHORESCENCE
3144-166428-0036 IT WAS FEATURELESS SMOOTH A BLIND CLIFF OF POLISHED BLUE METAL AND THAT WAS ALL RUTH GROANED VENTNOR WHERE IS SHE AGHAST AT MY MENTAL WITHDRAWAL FROM HIM ANGRY AT MYSELF FOR MY CALLOUSNESS
3144-166428-0037 AWKWARDLY I TRIED TO CRAWL OVER TO HIM TO TOUCH HIM COMFORT HIM AS WELL AS I MIGHT AND THEN AS THOUGH HIS CRY HAD BEEN A SIGNAL THE GREAT CONE BEGAN TO MOVE
3144-166428-0038 DOWN STEADILY DOWN
3144-166428-0039 FOR THE BOTTOM OF THE CONE WAS NOW AT A DECIDED ANGLE WHILE THE UPPER EDGE OF THE CIRCLE HAD DROPPED A FULL TWO HUNDRED FEET BELOW THE PLACE WHERE IT HAD RESTED AND STILL IT FELL THERE CAME A GASP OF RELIEF FROM VENTNOR
3144-166428-0040 A SIGH FROM DRAKE WHILE FROM MY OWN HEART A WEIGHT ROLLED NOT TEN YARDS AHEAD OF US AND STILL DEEP WITHIN THE LUMINOSITY HAD APPEARED THE REGAL HEAD OF NORHALA THE LOVELY HEAD OF RUTH
3144-166428-0041 THE TWO ROSE OUT OF THE GLOW LIKE SWIMMERS FLOATING FROM THE DEPTHS NOW THEY WERE CLEAR BEFORE US AND NOW WE COULD SEE THE SURFACE OF THE CUBE ON WHICH THEY RODE BUT NEITHER TURNED TO US EACH STARED STRAIGHTLY MOTIONLESS
3144-166428-0042 ALONG THE AXIS OF THE SINKING CONE THE WOMAN'S LEFT ARM HOLDING RUTH CLOSE TO HER SIDE DRAKE'S HAND CAUGHT MY SHOULDER IN A GRIP THAT HURT NOR DID HE NEED TO POINT TOWARD THAT WHICH HAD WRUNG THE EXCLAMATION FROM HIM
3144-166428-0043 THE FUNNEL HAD BROKEN FROM ITS SLOW FALLING IT HAD MADE ONE SWIFT STARTLING DROP AND HAD COME TO REST ITS RECUMBENT SIDE WAS NOW FLATTENED INTO A TRIANGULAR PLANE WIDENING FROM THE NARROW TIP IN WHICH WE STOOD
3144-166428-0044 TO ALL OF FIVE HUNDRED FEET WHERE ITS BASE RESTED AGAINST THE BLUE WALL AND FALLING AT A FULL THIRTY DEGREE PITCH THE MISTY EDGED CIRCLE HAD BECOME AN OVAL A FLATTENED ELLIPSE ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND THREE TIMES THAT IN LENGTH
3144-166428-0045 AND IN ITS EXACT CENTER SHINING FORTH AS THOUGH IT OPENED INTO A PLACE OF PALE AZURE INCANDESCENCE WAS ANOTHER RECTANGULAR CYCLOPEAN PORTAL ON EACH SIDE OF IT
3144-166428-0046 IN THE APPARENTLY SOLID FACE OF THE GLEAMING METALLIC CLIFFS A SLIT WAS OPENING THEY BEGAN AS THIN LINES A HUNDRED YARDS IN HEIGHT THROUGH WHICH THE INTENSE LIGHT SEEMED TO HISS
3144-166428-0047 QUICKLY THEY OPENED WIDENING LIKE MONSTROUS CAT PUPILS UNTIL AT LAST THEIR WIDENING CEASING THEY GLARED FORTH THE BLUE INCANDESCENCE GUSHING FROM THEM LIKE MOLTEN STEEL FROM AN OPENED SLUICE
3144-166428-0048 DEEP WITHIN THEM I SENSED A MOVEMENT SCORES OF TOWERING SHAPES SWAM WITHIN AND GLIDED OUT OF THEM EACH REFLECTING THE VIVID LIGHT AS THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES WERE INCANDESCENT AROUND THEIR CRESTS SPUN WIDE AND FLAMING CORONETS
3144-166428-0049 THEY RUSHED FORTH WHEELING WHIRLING DRIVEN LIKE LEAVES IN A WHIRLWIND OUT THEY SWIRLED FROM THE CAT'S EYES OF THE GLIMMERING WALL THESE DERVISH OBELISKS CROWDED WITH SPINNING FIRES THEY VANISHED IN THE MISTS
3144-166428-0050 INSTANTLY WITH THEIR GOING THE EYES CONTRACTED WERE BUT SLITS WERE GONE AND BEFORE US WITHIN THE OVAL WAS ONLY THE WAITING PORTAL THE LEADING BLOCK LEAPED FORWARD AS ABRUPTLY
3144-166428-0051 THOSE THAT BORE US FOLLOWED AGAIN UNDER THAT STRAIN OF PROJECTILE FLIGHT WE CLUTCHED EACH OTHER THE PONY SCREAMED IN TERROR THE METAL CLIFF RUSHED TO MEET US LIKE A THUNDER CLOUD OF STEEL THE PORTAL RACED UPON US
3144-166428-0052 A SQUARE MOUTH OF COLD BLUE FLAME AND INTO IT WE SWEPT WERE DEVOURED BY IT LIGHT IN BLINDING INTOLERABLE FLOOD BEAT ABOUT US BLACKENING THE SIGHT WITH AGONY
3144-166428-0053 WE PRESSED THE THREE OF US AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE PONY BURYING OUR FACES IN ITS SHAGGY COAT STRIVING TO HIDE OUR EYES FROM THE RADIANCE WHICH STRAIN CLOSELY AS WE MIGHT SEEMED TO PIERCE THROUGH THE BODY OF THE LITTLE BEAST THROUGH OUR OWN HEADS
