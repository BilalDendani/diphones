8190-284435-0017 THE BIG FROG SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND THEIR DIFFICULTY FOR HE KEPT MAKING NOISES IN HIS THROAT TO GUIDE THEM TO WHERE HE HAD LEAPED WHEN AT LAST THEY CAME UP TO HIM HE MADE A SECOND JUMP OUT OF SIGHT AS BEFORE AND WHEN THEY ATTEMPTED TO FOLLOW THEY FOUND A HUGE LIZARD LYING ACROSS THE PATH
8190-284435-0018 CAP'N BILL THOUGHT IT MUST BE A GIANT ALLIGATOR AT FIRST IT WAS SO BIG BUT HE LOOKED AT THEM SLEEPILY AND DID NOT SEEM AT ALL DANGEROUS
8190-284435-0019 DON'T DISTURB ME SAID THE LIZARD I'M DREAMING ABOUT PARSNIPS
8190-284435-0020 I DON'T CARE WHICH MURMURED THE LIZARD WHEN THEY'RE LITTLE THEY'RE JUICY WHEN THEY'RE BIG THERE'S MORE OF EM BUT EITHER WAY THERE'S NOTHING SO DELICIOUS AS A PARSNIP THERE ARE NONE HERE IN THE FOG BANK SO THE BEST I CAN DO IS DREAM OF THEM
8190-284435-0021 HE CLOSED HIS EYES SLEEPILY AND RESUMED HIS DREAMS WALKING AROUND THE LIZARD THEY RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY AND SOON CAME TO THE FROG BEING GUIDED BY ITS GRUNTS AND CROAKS THEN OFF IT WENT AGAIN ITS TREMENDOUS LEAP CARRYING IT FAR INTO THE FOG
8190-284435-0022 THEN HE SAW THAT HE HAD STUMBLED OVER THE CLAW OF A GIGANTIC LAND CRAB WHICH LAY SPRAWLED OUT UPON THE PEBBLY BOTTOM OH BEG PARDING I'M SURE EXCLAIMED CAP'N BILL BACKING AWAY DON'T MENTION IT REPLIED THE CRAB IN A TIRED TONE YOU DID NOT DISTURB ME SO THERE IS NO HARM DONE

8190-284435-0029 I'M SORRY BUT I'M DUE AT THE KING'S COURT IN A FEW MINUTES AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOUR SHORT WEAK LEGS TO MAKE THE JOURNEY TO THE PINK COUNTRY

8190-284435-0031 TROT SEATED HERSELF ON ONE SIDE OF HIM AND BUTTON BRIGHT ON THE OTHER AND THE SAILOR PUT HIS ARMS AROUND THEM BOTH TO HOLD THEM TIGHT TOGETHER ARE YOU READY ASKED THE FROG
8190-284435-0032 BUT THE FROG WAS UNABLE TO OBEY HIS REQUEST ITS POWERFUL HIND LEGS STRAIGHTENED LIKE STEEL SPRINGS AND SHOT THE BIG BODY WITH ITS PASSENGERS THROUGH THE FOG LIKE AN ARROW LAUNCHED FROM A BOW
