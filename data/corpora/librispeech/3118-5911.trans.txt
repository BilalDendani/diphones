3118-5911-0000 NOTHING IS MORE USUAL AND MORE NATURAL FOR THOSE WHO PRETEND TO DISCOVER ANYTHING NEW TO THE WORLD IN PHILOSOPHY AND THE SCIENCES THAN TO INSINUATE THE PRAISES OF THEIR OWN SYSTEMS BY DECRYING ALL THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN ADVANCED BEFORE THEM
3118-5911-0001 AND INDEED WERE THEY CONTENT WITH LAMENTING THAT IGNORANCE WHICH WE STILL LIE UNDER IN THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT CAN COME BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL OF HUMAN REASON THERE ARE FEW WHO HAVE AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SCIENCES
3118-5911-0002 THAT WOULD NOT READILY AGREE WITH THEM IT IS EASY FOR ONE OF JUDGMENT AND LEARNING TO PERCEIVE THE WEAK FOUNDATION EVEN OF THOSE SYSTEMS WHICH HAVE OBTAINED THE GREATEST CREDIT AND HAVE CARRIED THEIR PRETENSIONS HIGHEST
3118-5911-0003 TO ACCURATE AND PROFOUND REASONING PRINCIPLES TAKEN UPON TRUST CONSEQUENCES LAMELY DEDUCED FROM THEM WANT OF COHERENCE IN THE PARTS AND OF EVIDENCE IN THE WHOLE
3118-5911-0004 THESE ARE EVERY WHERE TO BE MET WITH IN THE SYSTEMS OF THE MOST EMINENT PHILOSOPHERS AND SEEM TO HAVE DRAWN DISGRACE UPON PHILOSOPHY ITSELF
3118-5911-0005 NOR IS THERE REQUIRED SUCH PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE TO DISCOVER THE PRESENT IMPERFECT CONDITION OF THE SCIENCES BUT EVEN THE RABBLE WITHOUT DOORS MAY JUDGE FROM THE NOISE AND CLAMOUR WHICH THEY HEAR
3118-5911-0006 THAT ALL GOES NOT WELL WITHIN THERE IS NOTHING WHICH IS NOT THE SUBJECT OF DEBATE AND IN WHICH MEN OF LEARNING ARE NOT OF CONTRARY OPINIONS THE MOST TRIVIAL QUESTION ESCAPES NOT OUR CONTROVERSY
3118-5911-0007 AND IN THE MOST MOMENTOUS WE ARE NOT ABLE TO GIVE ANY CERTAIN DECISION DISPUTES ARE MULTIPLIED AS IF EVERY THING WAS UNCERTAIN AND THESE DISPUTES ARE MANAGED WITH THE GREATEST WARMTH
3118-5911-0008 WHO HAS ART ENOUGH TO REPRESENT IT IN ANY FAVOURABLE COLOURS THE VICTORY IS NOT GAINED BY THE MEN AT ARMS WHO MANAGE THE PIKE AND THE SWORD BUT BY THE TRUMPETERS DRUMMERS AND MUSICIANS OF THE ARMY
3118-5911-0009 FROM HENCE IN MY OPINION ARISES THAT COMMON PREJUDICE AGAINST METAPHYSICAL REASONINGS OF ALL KINDS EVEN AMONGST THOSE WHO PROFESS THEMSELVES SCHOLARS
3118-5911-0010 AND HAVE A JUST VALUE FOR EVERY OTHER PART OF LITERATURE BY METAPHYSICAL REASONINGS THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THOSE ON ANY PARTICULAR BRANCH OF SCIENCE BUT EVERY KIND OF ARGUMENT WHICH IS ANY WAY ABSTRUSE
3118-5911-0011 THAT THEY SHALL AT LEAST BE NATURAL AND ENTERTAINING AND INDEED NOTHING BUT THE MOST DETERMINED SCEPTICISM ALONG WITH A GREAT DEGREE OF INDOLENCE CAN JUSTIFY THIS AVERSION TO METAPHYSICS
3118-5911-0012 FOR IF TRUTH BE AT ALL WITHIN THE REACH OF HUMAN CAPACITY IT IS CERTAIN IT MUST LIE VERY DEEP AND ABSTRUSE AND TO HOPE WE SHALL ARRIVE AT IT WITHOUT PAINS
3118-5911-0013 WHILE THE GREATEST GENIUSES HAVE FAILED WITH THE UTMOST PAINS MUST CERTAINLY BE ESTEEMED SUFFICIENTLY VAIN AND PRESUMPTUOUS I PRETEND TO NO SUCH ADVANTAGE IN THE PHILOSOPHY I AM GOING TO UNFOLD
3118-5911-0014 AND WOULD ESTEEM IT A STRONG PRESUMPTION AGAINST IT WERE IT SO VERY EASY AND OBVIOUS IT IS EVIDENT THAT ALL THE SCIENCES HAVE A RELATION GREATER OR LESS TO HUMAN NATURE
3118-5911-0015 AND THAT HOWEVER WIDE ANY OF THEM MAY SEEM TO RUN FROM IT THEY STILL RETURN BACK BY ONE PASSAGE OR ANOTHER EVEN MATHEMATICS NATURAL PHILOSOPHY AND NATURAL RELIGION ARE IN SOME MEASURE DEPENDENT ON THE SCIENCE OF MAN
3118-5911-0016 AND ARE JUDGED OF BY THEIR POWERS AND FACULTIES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHAT CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS WE MIGHT MAKE IN THESE SCIENCES WERE WE THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE EXTENT AND FORCE OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING
3118-5911-0017 AND COULD EXPLAIN THE NATURE OF THE IDEAS WE EMPLOY AND OF THE OPERATIONS WE PERFORM IN OUR REASONINGS AND THESE IMPROVEMENTS ARE THE MORE TO BE HOPED FOR IN NATURAL RELIGION
3118-5911-0018 AS IT IS NOT CONTENT WITH INSTRUCTING US IN THE NATURE OF SUPERIOR POWERS BUT CARRIES ITS VIEWS FARTHER TO THEIR DISPOSITION TOWARDS US AND OUR DUTIES TOWARDS THEM AND CONSEQUENTLY
3118-5911-0019 WE OURSELVES ARE NOT ONLY THE BEINGS THAT REASON BUT ALSO ONE OF THE OBJECTS CONCERNING WHICH WE REASON IF THEREFORE THE SCIENCES OF MATHEMATICS NATURAL PHILOSOPHY AND NATURAL RELIGION
3118-5911-0020 AND THE NATURE OF OUR IDEAS MORALS AND CRITICISM REGARD OUR TASTES AND SENTIMENTS AND POLITICS CONSIDER MEN AS UNITED IN SOCIETY AND DEPENDENT ON EACH OTHER IN THESE FOUR SCIENCES OF LOGIC
3118-5911-0021 MORALS CRITICISM AND POLITICS IS COMPREHENDED ALMOST EVERYTHING WHICH IT CAN ANY WAY IMPORT US TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH OR WHICH CAN TEND EITHER TO THE IMPROVEMENT OR ORNAMENT OF THE HUMAN MIND
3118-5911-0022 WE MAY EXTEND OUR CONQUESTS OVER ALL THOSE SCIENCES WHICH MORE INTIMATELY CONCERN HUMAN LIFE AND MAY AFTERWARDS PROCEED AT LEISURE TO DISCOVER MORE FULLY
3118-5911-0023 THERE IS NO QUESTION OF IMPORTANCE WHOSE DECISION IS NOT COMPRISED IN THE SCIENCE OF MAN AND THERE IS NONE WHICH CAN BE DECIDED WITH ANY CERTAINTY BEFORE WE BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THAT SCIENCE
3118-5911-0024 MUST BE LAID ON EXPERIENCE AND OBSERVATION IT IS NO ASTONISHING REFLECTION TO CONSIDER THAT THE APPLICATION OF EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY TO MORAL SUBJECTS SHOULD COME AFTER THAT TO NATURAL
3118-5911-0025 AT THE DISTANCE OF ABOVE A WHOLE CENTURY SINCE WE FIND IN FACT THAT THERE WAS ABOUT THE SAME INTERVAL BETWIXT THE ORIGINS OF THESE SCIENCES
3118-5911-0026 THE SPACE OF TIME IS NEARLY EQUAL TO THAT BETWIXT MY LORD BACON AND SOME LATE PHILOSOPHERS MISTER LOCKE MY LORD SHAFTESBURY DOCTOR MANDEVILLE MISTER HUTCHINSON DOCTOR BUTLER ET CETERA IN ENGLAND
3118-5911-0027 WHO HAVE BEGUN TO PUT THE SCIENCE OF MAN ON A NEW FOOTING AND HAVE ENGAGED THE ATTENTION AND EXCITED THE CURIOSITY OF THE PUBLIC SO TRUE IT IS THAT HOWEVER OTHER NATIONS MAY RIVAL US IN POETRY
3118-5911-0028 AND EXCEL US IN SOME OTHER AGREEABLE ARTS THE IMPROVEMENTS IN REASON AND PHILOSOPHY CAN ONLY BE OWING TO A LAND OF TOLERATION AND OF LIBERTY NOR OUGHT WE TO THINK
3118-5911-0029 THAT THIS LATTER IMPROVEMENT IN THE SCIENCE OF MAN WILL DO LESS HONOUR TO OUR NATIVE COUNTRY THAN THE FORMER IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY BUT OUGHT RATHER TO ESTEEM IT A GREATER GLORY UPON ACCOUNT OF THE GREATER IMPORTANCE OF THAT SCIENCE
3118-5911-0030 AS WELL AS THE NECESSITY IT LAY UNDER OF SUCH A REFORMATION FOR TO ME IT SEEMS EVIDENT THAT THE ESSENCE OF THE MIND BEING EQUALLY UNKNOWN TO US WITH THAT OF EXTERNAL BODIES
3118-5911-0031 IT MUST BE EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORM ANY NOTION OF ITS POWERS AND QUALITIES OTHERWISE THAN FROM CAREFUL AND EXACT EXPERIMENTS AND THE OBSERVATION OF THOSE PARTICULAR EFFECTS WHICH RESULT FROM ITS DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES
3118-5911-0032 AND SITUATIONS AND THOUGH WE MUST ENDEAVOUR TO RENDER ALL OUR PRINCIPLES AS UNIVERSAL AS POSSIBLE BY TRACING UP OUR EXPERIMENTS TO THE UTMOST AND EXPLAINING ALL EFFECTS FROM THE SIMPLEST AND FEWEST CAUSES
3118-5911-0033 IT IS STILL CERTAIN WE CANNOT GO BEYOND EXPERIENCE AND ANY HYPOTHESIS THAT PRETENDS TO DISCOVER THE ULTIMATE ORIGINAL QUALITIES OF HUMAN NATURE OUGHT AT FIRST TO BE REJECTED AS PRESUMPTUOUS
3118-5911-0034 AND CHIMERICAL I DO NOT THINK A PHILOSOPHER WHO WOULD APPLY HIMSELF SO EARNESTLY TO THE EXPLAINING THE ULTIMATE PRINCIPLES OF THE SOUL WOULD SHOW HIMSELF A GREAT MASTER IN THAT VERY SCIENCE OF HUMAN NATURE
3118-5911-0035 WHICH HE PRETENDS TO EXPLAIN OR VERY KNOWING IN WHAT IS NATURALLY SATISFACTORY TO THE MIND OF MAN FOR NOTHING IS MORE CERTAIN THAN THAT DESPAIR HAS ALMOST THE SAME EFFECT UPON US WITH ENJOYMENT
3118-5911-0036 AND THAT WE ARE NO SOONER ACQUAINTED WITH THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SATISFYING ANY DESIRE THAN THE DESIRE ITSELF VANISHES WHEN WE SEE THAT WE HAVE ARRIVED AT THE UTMOST EXTENT OF HUMAN REASON WE SIT DOWN CONTENTED
3118-5911-0037 THOUGH WE BE PERFECTLY SATISFIED IN THE MAIN OF OUR IGNORANCE AND PERCEIVE THAT WE CAN GIVE NO REASON FOR OUR MOST GENERAL AND MOST REFINED PRINCIPLES BESIDE OUR EXPERIENCE OF THEIR REALITY WHICH IS THE REASON
3118-5911-0038 IS ENOUGH TO SATISFY THE READER SO THE WRITER MAY DERIVE A MORE DELICATE SATISFACTION FROM THE FREE CONFESSION OF HIS IGNORANCE AND FROM HIS PRUDENCE IN AVOIDING THAT ERROR INTO WHICH SO MANY HAVE FALLEN
3118-5911-0039 OF IMPOSING THEIR CONJECTURES AND HYPOTHESES ON THE WORLD FOR THE MOST CERTAIN PRINCIPLES WHEN THIS MUTUAL CONTENTMENT AND SATISFACTION CAN BE OBTAINED BETWIXT THE MASTER AND SCHOLAR
3118-5911-0040 I KNOW NOT WHAT MORE WE CAN REQUIRE OF OUR PHILOSOPHY BUT IF THIS IMPOSSIBILITY OF EXPLAINING ULTIMATE PRINCIPLES SHOULD BE ESTEEMED A DEFECT IN THE SCIENCE OF MAN I WILL VENTURE TO AFFIRM
3118-5911-0041 THAT IT IS A DEFECT COMMON TO IT WITH ALL THE SCIENCES AND ALL THE ARTS IN WHICH WE CAN EMPLOY OURSELVES WHETHER THEY BE SUCH AS ARE CULTIVATED IN THE SCHOOLS OF THE PHILOSOPHERS
3118-5911-0042 OR PRACTISED IN THE SHOPS OF THE MEANEST ARTIZANS NONE OF THEM CAN GO BEYOND EXPERIENCE OR ESTABLISH ANY PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE NOT FOUNDED ON THAT AUTHORITY MORAL PHILOSOPHY HAS INDEED
3118-5911-0043 THIS PECULIAR DISADVANTAGE WHICH IS NOT FOUND IN NATURAL THAT IN COLLECTING ITS EXPERIMENTS IT CANNOT MAKE THEM PURPOSELY WITH PREMEDITATION
3118-5911-0044 AND AFTER SUCH A MANNER AS TO SATISFY ITSELF CONCERNING EVERY PARTICULAR DIFFICULTY WHICH MAY BE WHEN I AM AT A LOSS TO KNOW THE EFFECTS OF ONE BODY UPON ANOTHER IN ANY SITUATION
3118-5911-0045 I NEED ONLY PUT THEM IN THAT SITUATION AND OBSERVE WHAT RESULTS FROM IT BUT SHOULD I ENDEAVOUR TO CLEAR UP AFTER THE SAME MANNER ANY DOUBT IN MORAL PHILOSOPHY BY PLACING MYSELF IN THE SAME CASE WITH THAT WHICH I CONSIDER
3118-5911-0046 IT IS EVIDENT THIS REFLECTION AND PREMEDITATION WOULD SO DISTURB THE OPERATION OF MY NATURAL PRINCIPLES AS MUST RENDER IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FORM ANY JUST CONCLUSION FROM THE PHENOMENON WE MUST THEREFORE
3118-5911-0047 GLEAN UP OUR EXPERIMENTS IN THIS SCIENCE FROM A CAUTIOUS OBSERVATION OF HUMAN LIFE AND TAKE THEM AS THEY APPEAR IN THE COMMON COURSE OF THE WORLD BY MEN'S BEHAVIOUR IN COMPANY IN AFFAIRS AND IN THEIR PLEASURES
