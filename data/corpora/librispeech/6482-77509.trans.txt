6482-77509-0000 DIAMOND PANED WINDOWS AND A PROFUSION OF DWELLING ROOMS WITH SMOKE BLACKENED CEILINGS AND OAKEN WAINSCOTS
6482-77509-0001 ALL GNARLED AND WITHERED FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE SEA SPRAY BEHIND LAY THE SCATTERED HAMLET OF BRANKSOME BERE
6482-77509-0002 TO THE WEST WAS THE BROAD YELLOW BEACH AND THE IRISH SEA
6482-77509-0003 VERY BLEAK AND LONELY IT WAS UPON THIS WIGTOWN COAST A MAN MIGHT WALK MANY A WEARY MILE AND NEVER SEE A LIVING THING EXCEPT THE WHITE HEAVY FLAPPING KITTIWAKES WHICH SCREAMED AND CRIED TO EACH OTHER
6482-77509-0004 WITH THEIR SHRILL SAD VOICES VERY LONELY AND VERY BLEAK
6482-77509-0005 WAS NO SIGN OF THE WORKS OF MAN SAVE ONLY WHERE THE HIGH WHITE TOWER OF CLOOMBER HALL SHOT UP LIKE A HEADSTONE OF SOME GIANT GRAVE FROM AMID THE FIRS AND LARCHES WHICH GIRT IT ROUND
6482-77509-0006 THIS GREAT HOUSE A MILE OR MORE FROM OUR DWELLING HAD BEEN BUILT BY A WEALTHY GLASGOW MERCHANT OF STRANGE TASTES AND LONELY HABITS BUT AT THE TIME OF OUR ARRIVAL IT HAD BEEN UNTENANTED FOR MANY YEARS
6482-77509-0007 AND STOOD WITH WEATHER BLOTCHED WALLS AND VACANT STARING WINDOWS LOOKING BLANKLY OUT OVER THE HILL SIDE EMPTY AND MILDEWED IT SERVED ONLY AS A LANDMARK TO THE FISHERMEN
6482-77509-0008 ABOVE THE TROUBLED WATERS OF THE WIND SWEPT BAY TO THIS WILD SPOT IT WAS THAT FATE HAD BROUGHT MY FATHER MY SISTER AND MYSELF FOR US ITS LONELINESS HAD NO TERRORS AFTER THE HUBBUB AND BUSTLE OF A GREAT CITY
6482-77509-0009 AND THE WEARY TASK OF UPHOLDING APPEARANCES UPON A SLENDER INCOME THERE WAS A GRAND SOUL SOOTHING SERENITY IN THE LONG SKY LINE AND THE EAGER AIR HERE AT LEAST THERE WAS NO NEIGHBOUR TO PRY AND CHATTER
6482-77509-0010 THE LAIRD HAD LEFT HIS PHAETON AND TWO PONIES BEHIND HIM WITH THE AID OF WHICH MY FATHER AND I WOULD GO THE ROUND OF THE ESTATE DOING SUCH LIGHT DUTIES AS FALL TO AN AGENT OR FACTOR AS IT WAS THERE CALLED WHILE OUR GENTLE ESTHER
6482-77509-0011 SUCH WAS OUR SIMPLE UNEVENTFUL EXISTENCE UNTIL THE SUMMER NIGHT WHEN AN UNLOOKED FOR INCIDENT OCCURRED WHICH PROVED TO BE THE HERALD OF THOSE STRANGE DOINGS WHICH I HAVE TAKEN UP MY PEN TO DESCRIBE
6482-77509-0012 IT HAD BEEN MY HABIT TO PULL OUT OF AN EVENING IN THE LAIRD'S SKIFF AND TO CATCH A FEW WHITING WHICH MIGHT SERVE FOR OUR SUPPER ON THIS WELL REMEMBERED OCCASION MY SISTER CAME WITH ME SITTING WITH HER BOOK IN THE STERN SHEETS OF THE BOAT WHILE I HUNG MY LINES OVER THE BOWS
6482-77509-0013 WHEN MY SISTER PLUCKED AT MY SLEEVE WITH A LITTLE SHARP CRY OF SURPRISE SEE JOHN SHE CRIED THERE IS A LIGHT IN CLOOMBER TOWER I TURNED MY HEAD AND STARED BACK AT THE TALL WHITE TURRET WHICH PEEPED OUT ABOVE THE BELT OF TREES
6482-77509-0014 AS I GAZED I DISTINCTLY SAW AT ONE OF THE WINDOWS THE GLINT OF A LIGHT WHICH SUDDENLY VANISHED AND THEN SHONE OUT ONCE MORE FROM ANOTHER HIGHER UP THERE IT FLICKERED FOR SOME TIME
6482-77509-0015 IT WAS CLEAR THAT SOME ONE BEARING A LAMP OR A CANDLE HAD CLIMBED UP THE TOWER STAIRS AND HAD THEN RETURNED INTO THE BODY OF THE HOUSE
6482-77509-0016 MY SISTER SHOOK HER HEAD THERE IS NOT ONE OF THEM WOULD DARE TO SET FOOT WITHIN THE AVENUE GATES SHE SAID BESIDES JOHN THE KEYS ARE KEPT BY THE HOUSE AGENT AT WIGTOWN
6482-77509-0017 THE UNTIMELY VISITOR MUST EITHER HAVE USED CONSIDERABLE VIOLENCE IN ORDER TO FORCE HIS WAY IN OR HE MUST HAVE OBTAINED POSSESSION OF THE KEYS PIQUED BY THE LITTLE MYSTERY I PULLED FOR THE BEACH WITH THE DETERMINATION TO SEE FOR MYSELF WHO THE INTRUDER MIGHT BE
6482-77509-0018 AND WHAT WERE HIS INTENTIONS LEAVING MY SISTER AT BRANKSOME AND SUMMONING SETH JAMIESON AN OLD MAN O' WAR'S MAN AND ONE OF THE STOUTEST OF THE FISHERMEN

6482-77509-0020 IT'S NO CANNY TAE MEDDLE WI SUCH THINGS
6482-77509-0021 STUMBLING ACROSS THE MOOR TOGETHER WE MADE OUR WAY INTO THE WIGTOWN ROAD AT THE POINT WHERE THE HIGH STONE PILLARS MARK THE ENTRANCE TO THE CLOOMBER AVENUE
6482-77509-0022 WHICH SKIRTED THE ROAD IT'S A RICHT SAID JAMIESON TAKING A CLOSE LOOK AT THE DESERTED VEHICLE
