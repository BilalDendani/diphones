225-131259-0000 MISSUS HENRY VAN DER LUYDEN LISTENED IN SILENCE TO HER COUSIN MISSUS ARCHER'S NARRATIVE IT WAS ALL VERY WELL TO TELL YOURSELF IN ADVANCE THAT MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN WAS ALWAYS SILENT AND THAT
225-131259-0001 THOUGH NON COMMITTAL BY NATURE AND TRAINING SHE WAS VERY KIND TO THE PEOPLE SHE REALLY LIKED EVEN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF THESE FACTS WAS NOT ALWAYS A PROTECTION FROM THE CHILL THAT DESCENDED ON ONE
225-131259-0002 AND THE BEAUTIFUL OLD CARVED FRAME OF GAINSBOROUGH'S LADY ANGELICA DU LAC MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN'S PORTRAIT BY HUNTINGTON IN BLACK VELVET AND VENETIAN POINT
225-131259-0003 FACED THAT OF HER LOVELY ANCESTRESS IT WAS GENERALLY CONSIDERED AS FINE AS A CABANEL AND THOUGH TWENTY YEARS HAD ELAPSED SINCE ITS EXECUTION WAS STILL A PERFECT LIKENESS INDEED
225-131259-0004 THE MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN WHO SAT BENEATH IT LISTENING TO MISSUS ARCHER MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE TWIN SISTER OF THE FAIR AND STILL YOUNGISH WOMAN DROOPING AGAINST A GILT ARMCHAIR BEFORE A GREEN REP CURTAIN
225-131259-0005 MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN STILL WORE BLACK VELVET AND VENETIAN POINT WHEN SHE WENT INTO SOCIETY OR RATHER SINCE SHE NEVER DINED OUT WHEN SHE THREW OPEN HER OWN DOORS TO RECEIVE IT HER FAIR HAIR
225-131259-0006 THAN WHEN THE PORTRAIT HAD BEEN PAINTED SHE ALWAYS INDEED STRUCK NEWLAND ARCHER AS HAVING BEEN RATHER GRUESOMELY PRESERVED IN THE AIRLESS ATMOSPHERE OF A PERFECTLY IRREPROACHABLE EXISTENCE AS BODIES CAUGHT IN GLACIERS
225-131259-0007 THAN THE GRIMNESS OF SOME OF HIS MOTHER'S OLD AUNTS FIERCE SPINSTERS WHO SAID NO ON PRINCIPLE BEFORE THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE ASKED MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN'S ATTITUDE SAID NEITHER YES NOR NO
225-131259-0008 BUT ALWAYS APPEARED TO INCLINE TO CLEMENCY TILL HER THIN LIPS WAVERING INTO THE SHADOW OF A SMILE MADE THE ALMOST INVARIABLE REPLY I SHALL FIRST HAVE TO TALK THIS OVER WITH MY HUSBAND
225-131259-0009 SHE AND MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN WERE SO EXACTLY ALIKE THAT ARCHER OFTEN WONDERED HOW AFTER FORTY YEARS OF THE CLOSEST CONJUGALITY TWO SUCH MERGED IDENTITIES
225-131259-0010 EVER SEPARATED THEMSELVES ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING AS CONTROVERSIAL AS A TALKING OVER BUT AS NEITHER HAD EVER REACHED A DECISION WITHOUT PREFACING IT BY THIS MYSTERIOUS CONCLAVE MISSUS ARCHER AND HER SON
225-131259-0011 BY REACHING HER LONG HAND TOWARD THE BELL ROPE I THINK SHE SAID I SHOULD LIKE HENRY TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME A FOOTMAN APPEARED TO WHOM SHE GRAVELY ADDED
225-131259-0012 PRESIDING AT A CABINET MEETING NOT FROM ANY ARROGANCE OF MIND BUT BECAUSE THE HABIT OF A LIFE TIME AND THE ATTITUDE OF HER FRIENDS AND RELATIONS HAD LED HER TO CONSIDER MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN'S LEAST GESTURE
225-131259-0013 AS HAVING AN ALMOST SACERDOTAL IMPORTANCE HER PROMPTNESS OF ACTION SHOWED THAT SHE CONSIDERED THE CASE AS PRESSING AS MISSUS ARCHER BUT LEST SHE SHOULD BE THOUGHT TO HAVE COMMITTED HERSELF IN ADVANCE
225-131259-0014 SHE ADDED WITH THE SWEETEST LOOK HENRY ALWAYS ENJOYS SEEING YOU DEAR ADELINE AND HE WILL WISH TO CONGRATULATE NEWLAND THE DOUBLE DOORS HAD SOLEMNLY REOPENED
225-131259-0015 WERE MERELY PALE GREY INSTEAD OF PALE BLUE MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN GREETED MISSUS ARCHER WITH COUSINLY AFFABILITY PROFFERED TO NEWLAND LOW VOICED CONGRATULATIONS
225-131259-0016 COUCHED IN THE SAME LANGUAGE AS HIS WIFE'S AND SEATED HIMSELF IN ONE OF THE BROCADE ARMCHAIRS WITH THE SIMPLICITY OF A REIGNING SOVEREIGN I HAD JUST FINISHED READING THE TIMES HE SAID
225-131259-0017 I THINK MY UNCLE EGMONT USED TO SAY HE FOUND IT LESS AGITATING NOT TO READ THE MORNING PAPERS TILL AFTER DINNER SAID MISSUS ARCHER RESPONSIVELY YES MY GOOD FATHER ABHORRED HURRY
225-131259-0018 BUT NOW WE LIVE IN A CONSTANT RUSH SAID MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN IN MEASURED TONES LOOKING WITH PLEASANT DELIBERATION ABOUT THE LARGE SHROUDED ROOM WHICH TO ARCHER WAS SO COMPLETE AN IMAGE OF ITS OWNERS
225-131259-0019 AND PROCEEDED TO REHEARSE ONCE MORE THE MONSTROUS TALE OF THE AFFRONT INFLICTED ON MISSUS LOVELL MINGOTT OF COURSE SHE ENDED AUGUSTA WELLAND AND MARY MINGOTT BOTH FELT THAT
225-131259-0020 ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF NEWLAND'S ENGAGEMENT YOU AND HENRY OUGHT TO KNOW AH SAID MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN DRAWING A DEEP BREATH THERE WAS A SILENCE DURING WHICH
225-131259-0021 THE TICK OF THE MONUMENTAL ORMOLU CLOCK ON THE WHITE MARBLE MANTELPIECE GREW AS LOUD AS THE BOOM OF A MINUTE GUN ARCHER CONTEMPLATED WITH AWE
225-131259-0022 I'M CERTAIN OF IT SIR LARRY HAS BEEN GOING IT RATHER HARDER THAN USUAL LATELY IF COUSIN LOUISA WON'T MIND MY MENTIONING IT
225-131259-0023 TALKS AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE ABOUT THE IMPERTINENCE OF INVITING HIS WIFE TO MEET PEOPLE HE DOESN'T WISH HER TO KNOW HE'S SIMPLY USING MADAME OLENSKA AS A LIGHTNING ROD I'VE SEEN HIM TRY THE SAME THING OFTEN BEFORE THE LEFFERTSES
225-131259-0024 WE'LL HOPE IT HAS NOT QUITE COME TO THAT SAID MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN FIRMLY AH IF ONLY YOU AND LOUISA WENT OUT MORE SIGHED MISSUS ARCHER
225-131259-0025 THE VAN DER LUYDENS WERE MORBIDLY SENSITIVE TO ANY CRITICISM OF THEIR SECLUDED EXISTENCE THEY WERE THE ARBITERS OF FASHION THE COURT OF LAST APPEAL AND THEY KNEW IT AND BOWED TO THEIR FATE
225-131259-0026 BUT BEING SHY AND RETIRING PERSONS WITH NO NATURAL INCLINATION FOR THEIR PART THEY LIVED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN THE SYLVAN SOLITUDE OF SKUYTERCLIFF AND WHEN THEY CAME TO TOWN DECLINED ALL INVITATIONS
225-131259-0027 ON THE PLEA OF MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN'S HEALTH NEWLAND ARCHER CAME TO HIS MOTHER'S RESCUE EVERYBODY IN NEW YORK KNOWS WHAT YOU AND COUSIN LOUISA REPRESENT THAT'S WHY MISSUS MINGOTT FELT

225-131259-0031 FLUTTERED OVER MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN'S FACE SHE HAD EVIDENTLY GUESSED AND APPROVED MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN TURNED TO MISSUS ARCHER IF LOUISA'S HEALTH ALLOWED HER TO DINE OUT
