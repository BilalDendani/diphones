1100-135264-0001 THE HARBOR ICE GREW HARDER AND THICKER
1100-135264-0002 THE SAFE WAYS WERE BUSHED BY A BENEVOLENT GOVERNMENT AND NIGHT AND DAY THE GAY TINKLE OF THE SLEIGH BELLS SOUNDED ON IT ON MOONLIT NIGHTS ANNE HEARD THEM IN HER HOUSE OF DREAMS LIKE FAIRY CHIMES THE GULF FROZE OVER

1100-135264-0006 ANNE AND LESLIE TOOK LONG SNOWSHOE TRAMPS TOGETHER TOO OVER THE FIELDS OR ACROSS THE HARBOR AFTER STORMS OR THROUGH THE WOODS BEYOND THE GLEN THEY WERE VERY GOOD COMRADES IN THEIR RAMBLES AND THEIR FIRESIDE COMMUNINGS EACH HAD SOMETHING TO GIVE THE OTHER
1100-135264-0007 EACH FELT LIFE THE RICHER FOR FRIENDLY EXCHANGE OF THOUGHT AND FRIENDLY SILENCE EACH LOOKED ACROSS THE WHITE FIELDS BETWEEN THEIR HOMES WITH A PLEASANT CONSCIOUSNESS OF A FRIEND BEYOND BUT IN SPITE OF ALL THIS
1100-135264-0008 ANNE FELT THAT THERE WAS ALWAYS A BARRIER BETWEEN LESLIE AND HERSELF A CONSTRAINT THAT NEVER WHOLLY VANISHED I DON'T KNOW WHY I CAN'T GET CLOSER TO HER ANNE SAID ONE EVENING TO CAPTAIN JIM I LIKE HER SO MUCH I ADMIRE HER SO MUCH

1100-135264-0024 MISS CORNELIA AND ME WAS TALKING IT OVER THE OTHER DAY
1100-135264-0025 ANNE COULD HARDLY DISCARD IT COMPLETELY FOR THERE WERE UNDOUBTEDLY TIMES WHEN SHE FELT WITH AN INSTINCT THAT WAS NOT TO BE COMBATED BY REASON THAT LESLIE HARBORED A QUEER INDEFINABLE RESENTMENT TOWARDS HER
1100-135264-0026 AT TIMES THIS SECRET CONSCIOUSNESS MARRED THE DELIGHT OF THEIR COMRADESHIP AT OTHERS IT WAS ALMOST FORGOTTEN BUT ANNE ALWAYS FELT THE HIDDEN THORN WAS THERE AND MIGHT PRICK HER AT ANY MOMENT
1100-135264-0027 SHE FELT A CRUEL STING FROM IT ON THE DAY WHEN SHE TOLD LESLIE OF WHAT SHE HOPED THE SPRING WOULD BRING TO THE LITTLE HOUSE OF DREAMS LESLIE LOOKED AT HER WITH HARD BITTER UNFRIENDLY EYES SO YOU ARE TO HAVE THAT TOO SHE SAID IN A CHOKED VOICE
1100-135264-0028 AND WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD SHE HAD TURNED AND GONE ACROSS THE FIELDS HOMEWARD ANNE WAS DEEPLY HURT FOR THE MOMENT SHE FELT AS IF SHE COULD NEVER LIKE LESLIE AGAIN BUT WHEN LESLIE CAME OVER A FEW EVENINGS LATER SHE WAS SO PLEASANT SO FRIENDLY
1100-135264-0029 SO FRANK AND WITTY AND WINSOME THAT ANNE WAS CHARMED INTO FORGIVENESS AND FORGETFULNESS ONLY SHE NEVER MENTIONED HER DARLING HOPE TO LESLIE AGAIN NOR DID LESLIE EVER REFER TO IT BUT ONE EVENING WHEN LATE WINTER WAS LISTENING FOR THE WORD OF SPRING
1100-135264-0030 ANNE FOUND IT AFTER SHE WAS GONE AND OPENED IT WONDERINGLY IN IT WAS A TINY WHITE DRESS OF EXQUISITE WORKMANSHIP DELICATE EMBROIDERY WONDERFUL TUCKING SHEER LOVELINESS EVERY STITCH IN IT WAS HANDWORK

1100-135264-0035 ANNE HERSELF MADE MANY DESECRATED BY NO TOUCH OF MACHINERY SPENDING OVER THEM THE HAPPIEST HOURS OF THE HAPPY WINTER CAPTAIN JIM WAS THE MOST FREQUENT GUEST OF THE LITTLE HOUSE AND NONE WAS MORE WELCOME
1100-135264-0036 HE WAS AS REFRESHING AS A SEA BREEZE AS INTERESTING AS SOME ANCIENT CHRONICLE SHE WAS NEVER TIRED OF LISTENING TO HIS STORIES AND HIS QUAINT REMARKS AND COMMENTS WERE A CONTINUAL DELIGHT TO HER
1100-135264-0037 CAPTAIN JIM WAS ONE OF THOSE RARE AND INTERESTING PEOPLE WHO NEVER SPEAK BUT THEY SAY SOMETHING THE MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS AND THE WISDOM OF THE SERPENT WERE MINGLED IN HIS COMPOSITION IN DELIGHTFUL PROPORTIONS
1100-135264-0038 NOTHING EVER SEEMED TO PUT CAPTAIN JIM OUT OR DEPRESS HIM IN ANY WAY I'VE KIND OF CONTRACTED A HABIT OF ENJ'YING THINGS HE REMARKED ONCE WHEN ANNE HAD COMMENTED ON HIS INVARIABLE CHEERFULNESS
