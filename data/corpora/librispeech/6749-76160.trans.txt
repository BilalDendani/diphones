6749-76160-0000 THAT WHEREAS YOU PEOPLE ON THE EARTH HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO USE THE HOTHOUSE PRINCIPLE WE HERE HAVE PERFECTED IT I SUGGEST THAT YOU WASTE NO TIME LOOKING FOR FAULTS VAN EMMON STARED AT THE DOCTOR
6749-76160-0001 HOW DOES THIS IDEA FIT YOUR THEORY KINNEY THAT VENUS IS SIMPLY THE EARTH PLUS SEVERAL THOUSAND EXTRA GENERATIONS OF CIVILIZATION FIT ECHOED THE DOCTOR FITS LIKE A GLOVE
6749-76160-0002 TURNING TO THEIR GUIDE IS THAT YOU USE YOUR LEGS FOR THEIR ORIGINAL PURPOSE ESTRA SMILED AND POINTED OUT SOMETHING STANDING A FEW FEET AWAY IT WAS A SMALL SHUTTLE SHAPED AIR CRAFT
6749-76160-0003 WITH CLEAR GLASS SIDES WHICH HAD ACTUALLY MADE THEM OVERLOOK IT AT FIRST PEERING CLOSER THEY SAW THAT THE PLAZA AND SURROUNDING STREETS WERE NEARLY FILLED WITH THESE ALL BUT INVISIBLE CARS THE VENUSIAN EXPLAINED
6749-76160-0004 I AM GLAD YOU HAVE BROUGHT UP THIS POINT BECAUSE IT IS A FACT THAT OUR PEOPLE USE MECHANISMS INSTEAD OF BODILY ENERGY ALMOST ALTOGETHER THESE CARS YOU SEE ARE UNIVERSALLY USED FOR TRANSPORTATION I AM ONE OF THE VERY FEW
6749-76160-0005 WHO APPRECIATE THE VALUE OF NATURAL EXERCISE DO YOU MEAN TO SAY DEMANDED VAN EMMON THAT THE AVERAGE VENUSIAN DOES NO WALKING NOT A MILE A YEAR SAID ESTRA GRAVELY
6749-76160-0006 JUST WHAT HE IS OBLIGED TO DO INDOORS FROM ROOM TO ROOM AND HE INVOLUNTARILY GLANCED DOWN AT HIS OWN EXTREMELY THIN LEGS
6749-76160-0007 I SEE NOW SHE MURMURED THAT'S WHY THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE TO GREET US THE VENUSIAN SMILED GRATEFULLY WE THOUGHT IT BEST YOU'D HAVE BEEN SHOCKED OUTRIGHT I AM SURE
6749-76160-0008 WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION THEY FELL SILENT STILL WITHOUT MOVING FROM THE POINT WHERE THEY HAD LEFT THE ELEVATOR
6749-76160-0009 WAS A PARTICULARLY LARGE STRUCTURE LIKE ALL THE REST IT WAS OF HOPELESSLY IRREGULAR DESIGN YET IT HAD A LARGE DOMED CENTRAL PORTION WHICH GAVE IT THE APPEARANCE OF AN AUDITORIUM
6749-76160-0010 AND SMITH TRIED TO STARE THROUGH THE TRANSLUCENT WALLS OF THE THING THE OTHER BUILDINGS WITHIN IMMEDIATE REACH WERE OF EVERY POSSIBLE APPEARANCE SOME WOULD HAVE PASSED FOR COTTAGES OTHERS FOR STORES STILL OTHERS
6749-76160-0011 FOR THE MOST FANCIFUL OF STUDIOS AND NOWHERE WAS THERE SUCH A THING AS A SIGN EVEN AT THE STREET CORNERS MUCH LESS ON A BUILDING NOT THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO READ YOUR SIGNS IF YOU HAD THEM COMMENTED THE DOCTOR
6749-76160-0012 BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW YOUR PEOPLE FIND THEIR WAY WITHOUT SOMETHING OF THAT KIND TO GUIDE THEM ESTRA'S SMILE DID NOT CHANGE THAT IS SOMETHING YOU WILL UNDERSTAND BETTER BEFORE LONG SAID HE
6749-76160-0013 PROVIDED YOU FEEL READY TO EXPLORE A LITTLE FURTHER THE FOUR LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN QUESTION AND SUDDENLY IT STRUCK THEM ALL
6749-76160-0014 IN THEIR CUMBERSOME SUITS OF ARMOR AND FORMIDABLE HELMETS THE DOCTOR TURNED TO ESTRA YOU OUGHT TO KNOW HE APPEALED WHETHER WE CAN TAKE OFF THESE SUITS NOW IT WOULD BE BEST WAS THE REPLY
6749-76160-0015 VAN EMMON AND BILLIE FOLLOWED MORE SLOWLY THE ONE BECAUSE HE DID NOT SHARE THE DOCTOR'S CONFIDENCE IN THEIR GUIDE THE OTHER BECAUSE OF A SUDDEN SHYNESS IN HIS PRESENCE THE VENUSIAN NOTED THIS
6749-76160-0016 YOU NEED NOT FEEL ANY EMBARRASSMENT SAID HE TO BILLIE'S VAST ASTONISHMENT THERE IS NO DISTINCTION HERE BETWEEN THE DRESS OF THE TWO SEXES AND AGAIN ALL FOUR MARVELED THAT HE SHOULD KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT THEM
6749-76160-0017 ONCE OUT OF THE ARMOR THE VISITORS FELT MUCH MORE AT EASE THE SLIGHTLY REDUCED GRAVITATION GAVE THEM A SENSE OF LIGHTNESS AND FREEDOM WHICH MORE THAN BALANCED THE JUNGLELIKE OPPRESSIVENESS OF THE AIR
6749-76160-0018 THEY FOUND THEMSELVES GUARDING AGAINST A CERTAIN EXUBERANCE PERHAPS IT WAS THE EXTRA OXYGEN TOO THEY STRODE TOWARD THE LARGE STRUCTURE DIRECTLY AHEAD AT ITS ENTRANCE A WIDE SQUARE PORTAL
6749-76160-0019 WHICH OPENED INTO A FAN SHAPED LOBBY ESTRA PAUSED AND SMILED APOLOGETICALLY AS HE MOPPED HIS FOREHEAD AND UPPER LIP WITH A PAPER HANDKERCHIEF
6749-76160-0020 TRAP COVERED OPENING IN THE WALL AT HIS SIDE THESE LITTLE DOORS BY THE WAY WERE TO BE SEEN AT FREQUENT INTERVALS WHEREVER THEY WENT INCIDENTALLY NOT A SCRAP OF PAPER OR OTHER REFUSE WAS TO BE NOTED ANYWHERE
6749-76160-0021 STREETS AND ALL WERE SPOTLESS AS FOR ESTRA I AM NOT ACCUSTOMED TO MOVING AT SUCH SPEED HE EXPLAINED HIS DISCOMFORT IF YOU DO NOT MIND PLEASE WALK A LITTLE MORE LEISURELY
6749-76160-0022 WERE MOST REMARKABLY ORNAMENTED THEY WERE FAIRLY COVERED WITH WHAT APPEARED AT FIRST GLANCE TO BE ABSOLUTELY LIFELIKE PAINTINGS AND SCULPTURES THEY WERE SO ARRANGED AS TO STRENGTHEN THE STRUCTURAL LINES OF THE PLACE AND OF COURSE
6749-76160-0023 FOOTNOTE THE SPECIALIST IN ARCHITECTURE AND RELATED SUBJECTS IS REFERRED TO E WILLIAMS JACKSON'S REPORT TO THE A I A FOR DETAILS OF THESE BASRELIEF PHOTOGRAPHS
6749-76160-0024 DESIRING TO EXAMINE SOME OF THE WORK FAR OVERHEAD BILLIE CLAMBERED UP ON A CONVENIENT PEDESTAL IN ORDER TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY SHE TOOK THE STRENGTH OF THINGS FOR GRANTED
6749-76160-0025 AND PUT HER WEIGHT TOO HEAVILY ON A MOLDING ON THE EDGE OF THE PEDESTAL WITH THE RESULT THAT THERE WAS A SHARP CRACK AND THE GIRL STRUCK THE FLOOR IN A HEAP SHE GOT TO HER FEET BEFORE VAN EMMON COULD REACH HER SIDE BUT HER FACE WAS WHITE WITH PAIN
6749-76160-0026 I AM SORRY THIS HAPPENED IT WILL NOT BE EASY TO EXPLAIN BUT YOU WILL FIND ALL VENUSIANS VERY UNSYMPATHETIC NOT
6749-76160-0027 BUT BECAUSE WE SIMPLY LOST THE POWER OF SYMPATHY WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT PITY IS WE HAVE ELIMINATED EVERYTHING THAT IS DISAGREEABLE ALL THAT IS PAINFUL FROM OUR LIVES TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT
6749-76160-0028 THERE IS NEVER ANY CAUSE FOR PITY THE THREE YOUNG PEOPLE COULD SAY NOTHING IN ANSWER THE DOCTOR HOWEVER SPOKE THOUGHTFULLY PERHAPS IT IS SUPERFLUOUS BUT TELL ME HAVE YOU DONE AWAY WITH INJUSTICE ESTRA
6749-76160-0029 TURNED TO EXAMINE OTHER WORK BUT AT THE MOMENT ANOTHER VENUSIAN APPROACHED FROM THE UPPER END OF THE LOBBY WALKING SLOWLY HE CARRIED FOUR SMALL PARCELS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT AND THE EXPLORERS HAD TIME TO SCRUTINIZE HIM CLOSELY
6749-76160-0030 HE WAS BUILT MUCH LIKE ESTRA BUT SHORTER AND WITH A LITTLE MORE FLESH ABOUT THE TORSO HIS FOREHEAD BULGED DIRECTLY OVER HIS EYES INSTEAD OF ABOVE HIS EARS AS DID ESTRA'S
6749-76160-0031 ALSO HIS EYES WERE SMALLER AND NOT AS FAR APART HIS WHOLE EXPRESSION WAS EQUALLY KIND AND AFFABLE DESPITE A CURIOUSLY SHRIVELED APPEARANCE OF HIS LIPS
6749-76160-0032 IN A WAY IT WAS SPANISH OR RATHER THE PURE CASTILIAN TONGUE BUT IT SEEMED TO BE DEVOID OF DENTAL CONSONANTS
6749-76160-0033 FEW OF US HAVE MASTERED IT THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES AS FOR THESE MACHINES
6749-76160-0034 I MUST APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE FOR CERTAIN DEFECTS IN THEIR DESIGN I INVENTED THEM UNDER PRESSURE SO TO SPEAK HAVING TO PERFECT THE WHOLE IDEA IN THE RATHER SHORT TIME THAT HAS ELAPSED SINCE YOU DOCTOR BEGAN THE SKY CAR AND
6749-76160-0035 WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE MACHINES FROM BILLIE AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO ACCEPT THE FIRST OF THE DEVICES FROM THE VENUSIAN FOR SOME REASON HE APPEARED TO BE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN THE GIRL AND ADDRESSED HALF OF HIS REMARKS TO HER AND
6749-76160-0036 IT WAS WHILE HIS SMILING GAZE WAS FIXED UPON HER EYES THAT HE GAVE THE ANSWER THEY ARE TO SERVE VERY CAREFULLY PARTLY AS LEXICONS AND PARTLY AS GRAMMARS
