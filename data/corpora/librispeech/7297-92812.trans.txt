7297-92812-0000 AN ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE IN AN ART EXHIBITION THE OTHER DAY I SAW A PAINTING THAT HAD BEEN SOLD FOR FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THE PAINTER WAS A YOUNG SCRUB OUT OF THE WEST NAMED KRAFT WHO HAD A FAVOURITE FOOD AND A PET THEORY
7297-92812-0001 HIS PABULUM WAS AN UNQUENCHABLE BELIEF IN THE UNERRING ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE HIS THEORY WAS FIXED AROUND CORNED BEEF HASH WITH POACHED EGG THERE WAS A STORY BEHIND THE PICTURE SO I WENT HOME AND LET IT DRIP OUT OF A FOUNTAIN PEN THE IDEA OF KRAFT
7297-92812-0002 BUT THAT IS NOT THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY THREE YEARS AGO KRAFT BILL JUDKINS A POET AND I TOOK OUR MEALS AT CYPHER'S ON EIGHTH AVENUE I SAY TOOK WHEN WE HAD MONEY CYPHER GOT IT OFF OF US AS HE EXPRESSED IT WE HAD NO CREDIT
7297-92812-0003 WE WENT IN CALLED FOR FOOD AND ATE IT WE PAID OR WE DID NOT PAY WE HAD CONFIDENCE IN CYPHER'S SULLENNESS AND SMOULDERING FEROCITY DEEP DOWN IN HIS SUNLESS SOUL HE WAS EITHER A PRINCE A FOOL OR AN ARTIST
7297-92812-0004 HE SAT AT A WORM EATEN DESK COVERED WITH FILES OF WAITERS CHECKS SO OLD THAT I WAS SURE THE BOTTOMEST ONE WAS FOR CLAMS THAT HENDRIK HUDSON HAD EATEN AND PAID FOR
7297-92812-0005 OF THROWING A FILM OVER HIS EYES RENDERING OPAQUE THE WINDOWS OF HIS SOUL ONCE WHEN WE LEFT HIM UNPAID WITH EGREGIOUS EXCUSES I LOOKED BACK AND SAW HIM SHAKING WITH INAUDIBLE LAUGHTER BEHIND HIS FILM NOW AND THEN WE PAID UP BACK SCORES
7297-92812-0006 BUT THE CHIEF THING AT CYPHER'S WAS MILLY MILLY WAS A WAITRESS SHE WAS A GRAND EXAMPLE OF KRAFT'S THEORY OF THE ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE SHE BELONGED LARGELY TO WAITING AS MINERVA DID TO THE ART OF SCRAPPING OR VENUS TO THE SCIENCE OF SERIOUS FLIRTATION
7297-92812-0007 PEDESTALLED AND IN BRONZE SHE MIGHT HAVE STOOD WITH THE NOBLEST OF HER HEROIC SISTERS AS LIVER AND BACON ENLIVENING THE WORLD SHE BELONGED TO CYPHER'S YOU EXPECTED TO SEE HER COLOSSAL FIGURE LOOM THROUGH THAT REEKING BLUE CLOUD OF SMOKE FROM FRYING FAT
7297-92812-0008 JUST AS YOU EXPECT THE PALISADES TO APPEAR THROUGH A DRIFTING HUDSON RIVER FOG THERE AMID THE STEAM OF VEGETABLES AND THE VAPOURS OF ACRES OF HAM AND THE CRASH OF CROCKERY THE CLATTER OF STEEL THE SCREAMING OF SHORT ORDERS
7297-92812-0009 THE CRIES OF THE HUNGERING AND ALL THE HORRID TUMULT OF FEEDING MAN SURROUNDED BY SWARMS OF THE BUZZING WINGED BEASTS BEQUEATHED US BY PHARAOH MILLY STEERED HER MAGNIFICENT WAY LIKE SOME GREAT LINER CLEAVING AMONG THE CANOES OF HOWLING SAVAGES
7297-92812-0010 OUR GODDESS OF GRUB WAS BUILT ON LINES SO MAJESTIC THAT THEY COULD BE FOLLOWED ONLY WITH AWE HER SLEEVES WERE ALWAYS ROLLED ABOVE HER ELBOWS
7297-92812-0011 SHE HAD SEEN FEWER YEARS THAN ANY OF US BUT SHE WAS OF SUCH SUPERB EVEHOOD AND SIMPLICITY THAT SHE MOTHERED US FROM THE BEGINNING CYPHER'S STORE OF EATABLES SHE POURED OUT UPON US WITH ROYAL INDIFFERENCE TO PRICE AND QUANTITY AS FROM A CORNUCOPIA THAT KNEW NO EXHAUSTION
7297-92812-0012 HER VOICE RANG LIKE A GREAT SILVER BELL HER SMILE WAS MANY TOOTHED AND FREQUENT SHE SEEMED LIKE A YELLOW SUNRISE ON MOUNTAIN TOPS I NEVER SAW HER BUT I THOUGHT OF THE YOSEMITE AND YET SOMEHOW I COULD NEVER THINK OF HER AS EXISTING OUTSIDE OF CYPHER'S
7297-92812-0013 THERE NATURE HAD PLACED HER AND SHE HAD TAKEN ROOT AND GROWN MIGHTILY SHE SEEMED HAPPY AND TOOK HER FEW POOR DOLLARS ON SATURDAY NIGHTS WITH THE FLUSHED PLEASURE OF A CHILD THAT RECEIVES AN UNEXPECTED DONATION IT WAS KRAFT WHO FIRST VOICED THE FEAR THAT EACH OF US MUST HAVE HELD LATENTLY
7297-92812-0014 ONE OF US COMPARED THE HARMONY EXISTING BETWEEN A HAYDN SYMPHONY AND PISTACHE ICE CREAM TO THE EXQUISITE CONGRUITY BETWEEN MILLY AND CYPHER'S THERE IS A CERTAIN FATE HANGING OVER MILLY SAID KRAFT AND IF IT OVERTAKES HER SHE IS LOST TO CYPHER'S AND TO US
7297-92812-0015 SHE WILL GROW FAT ASKED JUDKINS FEARSOMELY SHE WILL GO TO NIGHT SCHOOL AND BECOME REFINED I VENTURED ANXIOUSLY IT IS THIS SAID KRAFT PUNCTUATING IN A PUDDLE OF SPILLED COFFEE WITH A STIFF FOREFINGER
7297-92812-0016 CAESAR HAD HIS BRUTUS THE COTTON HAS ITS BOLLWORM THE CHORUS GIRL HAS HER PITTSBURGER THE SUMMER BOARDER HAS HIS POISON IVY THE HERO HAS HIS CARNEGIE MEDAL ART HAS ITS MORGAN THE ROSE HAS ITS SPEAK I INTERRUPTED MUCH PERTURBED
7297-92812-0017 ONE DAY CONCLUDED KRAFT SOLEMNLY THERE WILL COME TO CYPHER'S FOR A PLATE OF BEANS A MILLIONAIRE LUMBERMAN FROM WISCONSIN AND HE WILL MARRY MILLY NEVER EXCLAIMED JUDKINS AND I IN HORROR A LUMBERMAN REPEATED KRAFT HOARSELY
7297-92812-0018 AND A MILLIONAIRE LUMBERMAN I SIGHED DESPAIRINGLY FROM WISCONSIN GROANED JUDKINS WE AGREED THAT THE AWFUL FATE SEEMED TO MENACE HER FEW THINGS WERE LESS IMPROBABLE MILLY LIKE SOME VAST VIRGIN STRETCH OF PINE WOODS
7297-92812-0019 WAS MADE TO CATCH THE LUMBERMAN'S EYE AND WELL WE KNEW THE HABITS OF THE BADGERS ONCE FORTUNE SMILED UPON THEM STRAIGHT TO NEW YORK THEY HIE AND LAY THEIR GOODS AT THE FEET OF THE GIRL WHO SERVES THEM BEANS IN A BEANERY WHY THE ALPHABET ITSELF CONNIVES THE SUNDAY NEWSPAPER'S HEADLINER'S WORK IS CUT FOR HIM
7297-92812-0020 WINSOME WAITRESS WINS WEALTHY WISCONSIN WOODSMAN FOR A WHILE WE FELT THAT MILLY WAS ON THE VERGE OF BEING LOST TO US IT WAS OUR LOVE OF THE UNERRING ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE THAT INSPIRED US WE COULD NOT GIVE HER OVER TO A LUMBERMAN DOUBLY ACCURSED BY WEALTH AND PROVINCIALISM
7297-92812-0021 WE SHUDDERED TO THINK OF MILLY WITH HER VOICE MODULATED AND HER ELBOWS COVERED POURING TEA IN THE MARBLE TEEPEE OF A TREE MURDERER NO IN CYPHER'S SHE BELONGED IN THE BACON SMOKE THE CABBAGE PERFUME THE GRAND WAGNERIAN CHORUS OF HURLED IRONSTONE CHINA AND RATTLING CASTERS
7297-92812-0022 OUR FEARS MUST HAVE BEEN PROPHETIC FOR ON THAT SAME EVENING THE WILDWOOD DISCHARGED UPON US MILLY'S PREORDAINED CONFISCATOR OUR FEE TO ADJUSTMENT AND ORDER BUT ALASKA AND NOT WISCONSIN BORE THE BURDEN OF THE VISITATION
7297-92812-0023 WE WERE AT OUR SUPPER OF BEEF STEW AND DRIED APPLES WHEN HE TROTTED IN AS IF ON THE HEELS OF A DOG TEAM AND MADE ONE OF THE MESS AT OUR TABLE WITH THE FREEDOM OF THE CAMPS HE ASSAULTED OUR EARS AND CLAIMED THE FELLOWSHIP OF MEN LOST IN THE WILDS OF A HASH HOUSE
7297-92812-0024 WE EMBRACED HIM AS A SPECIMEN AND IN THREE MINUTES WE HAD ALL BUT DIED FOR ONE ANOTHER AS FRIENDS HE WAS RUGGED AND BEARDED AND WIND DRIED HE HAD JUST COME OFF THE TRAIL HE SAID AT ONE OF THE NORTH RIVER FERRIES I FANCIED I COULD SEE THE SNOW DUST OF CHILCOOT YET POWDERING HIS SHOULDERS
7297-92812-0025 BANK DRAFTS FOR TWO MILLIONS WAS HIS SUMMING UP AND A THOUSAND A DAY PILING UP FROM MY CLAIMS AND NOW I WANT SOME BEEF STEW AND CANNED PEACHES I NEVER GOT OFF THE TRAIN SINCE I MUSHED OUT OF SEATTLE AND I'M HUNGRY
7297-92812-0026 THE STUFF THE NIGGERS FEED YOU ON PULLMANS DON'T COUNT YOU GENTLEMEN ORDER WHAT YOU WANT AND THEN MILLY LOOMED UP WITH A THOUSAND DISHES ON HER BARE ARM LOOMED UP BIG AND WHITE AND PINK AND AWFUL AS MOUNT SAINT ELIAS WITH A SMILE LIKE DAY BREAKING IN A GULCH
7297-92812-0027 AND THE KLONDIKER THREW DOWN HIS PELTS AND NUGGETS AS DROSS AND LET HIS JAW FALL HALF WAY AND STARED AT HER YOU COULD ALMOST SEE THE DIAMOND TIARAS ON MILLY'S BROW AND THE HAND EMBROIDERED SILK PARIS GOWNS THAT HE MEANT TO BUY FOR HER
7297-92812-0028 AT LAST THE BOLLWORM HAD ATTACKED THE COTTON THE POISON IVY WAS REACHING OUT ITS TENDRILS TO ENTWINE THE SUMMER BOARDER THE MILLIONAIRE LUMBERMAN THINLY DISGUISED AS THE ALASKAN MINER WAS ABOUT TO ENGULF OUR MILLY AND UPSET NATURE'S ADJUSTMENT KRAFT WAS THE FIRST TO ACT
7297-92812-0029 HE LEAPED UP AND POUNDED THE KLONDIKER'S BACK COME OUT AND DRINK HE SHOUTED DRINK FIRST AND EAT AFTERWARD JUDKINS SEIZED ONE ARM AND I THE OTHER GAILY ROARINGLY IRRESISTIBLY IN JOLLY GOOD FELLOW STYLE WE DRAGGED HIM FROM THE RESTAURANT TO A CAFE
7297-92812-0030 STUFFING HIS POCKETS WITH HIS EMBALMED BIRDS AND INDIGESTIBLE NUGGETS THERE HE RUMBLED A ROUGHLY GOOD HUMOURED PROTEST THAT'S THE GIRL FOR MY MONEY HE DECLARED SHE CAN EAT OUT OF MY SKILLET THE REST OF HER LIFE WHY I NEVER SEE SUCH A FINE GIRL
7297-92812-0031 I'M GOING BACK THERE AND ASK HER TO MARRY ME
7297-92812-0032 YOU'LL TAKE ANOTHER WHISKEY AND MILK NOW KRAFT PERSUADED WITH SATAN'S SMILE I THOUGHT YOU UP COUNTRY FELLOWS WERE BETTER SPORTS KRAFT SPENT HIS PUNY STORE OF COIN AT THE BAR
7297-92812-0033 AND THEN GAVE JUDKINS AND ME SUCH AN APPEALING LOOK THAT WE WENT DOWN TO THE LAST DIME WE HAD IN TOASTING OUR GUEST THEN WHEN OUR AMMUNITION WAS GONE AND THE KLONDIKER
7297-92812-0034 STILL SOMEWHAT SOBER BEGAN TO BABBLE AGAIN OF MILLY KRAFT WHISPERED INTO HIS EAR SUCH A POLITE BARBED INSULT RELATING TO PEOPLE WHO WERE MISERLY WITH THEIR FUNDS THAT THE MINER CRASHED DOWN HANDFUL AFTER HANDFUL OF SILVER AND NOTES CALLING FOR ALL THE FLUIDS IN THE WORLD TO DROWN THE IMPUTATION
7297-92812-0035 THUS THE WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH HIS OWN GUNS WE DROVE HIM FROM THE FIELD AND THEN WE HAD HIM CARTED TO A DISTANT SMALL HOTEL AND PUT TO BED WITH HIS NUGGETS AND BABY SEAL SKINS STUFFED AROUND HIM HE WILL NEVER FIND CYPHER'S AGAIN SAID KRAFT
7297-92812-0036 HE WILL PROPOSE TO THE FIRST WHITE APRON HE SEES IN A DAIRY RESTAURANT TO MORROW AND MILLY I MEAN THE NATURAL ADJUSTMENT IS SAVED AND BACK TO CYPHER'S WENT WE THREE AND FINDING CUSTOMERS SCARCE WE JOINED HANDS AND DID AN INDIAN DANCE WITH MILLY IN THE CENTRE
7297-92812-0037 THIS I SAY HAPPENED THREE YEARS AGO AND ABOUT THAT TIME A LITTLE LUCK DESCENDED UPON US THREE
7297-92812-0038 OUR PATHS SEPARATED AND I SAW KRAFT NO MORE AND JUDKINS SELDOM BUT AS I SAID I SAW A PAINTING THE OTHER DAY THAT WAS SOLD FOR FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THE TITLE WAS BOADICEA AND THE FIGURE SEEMED TO FILL ALL OUT OF DOORS BUT OF ALL THE PICTURE'S ADMIRERS WHO STOOD BEFORE IT
7297-92812-0039 I BELIEVE I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO LONGED FOR BOADICEA TO STALK FROM HER FRAME BRINGING ME CORNED BEEF HASH WITH POACHED EGG I HURRIED AWAY TO SEE KRAFT HIS SATANIC EYES WERE THE SAME HIS HAIR WAS WORSE TANGLED BUT HIS CLOTHES HAD BEEN MADE BY A TAILOR I DIDN'T KNOW I SAID TO HIM
7297-92812-0040 WE'VE BOUGHT A COTTAGE IN THE BRONX WITH THE MONEY SAID HE ANY EVENING AT SEVEN THEN SAID I WHEN YOU LED US AGAINST THE LUMBERMAN THE KLONDIKER IT WASN'T ALTOGETHER ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNERRING ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE
