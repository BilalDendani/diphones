8040-260923-0000 SHE FOUND HERSELF STANDING PARTLY RESTING UPON THE TABLE GREAT TEARING SOBS RACKED HER SLIGHT YOUNG BODY BUT AT LEAST SHE WAS BREATHING THERE WAS NO MORE CONSTRICTION OF HER WINDPIPE
8040-260923-0001 HER HEAD STILL ACHED HOWEVER HER NECK FELT STIFF AND SORE AND SHE REMAINED SOMEWHAT GIDDY AND CONFUSED SHE EYED RATHER WILDLY HER HANDS
8040-260923-0002 THE OTHER THE WEAPON WITH WHICH SHE HAD CHEATED DEATH A BRONZE PAPERWEIGHT PROBABLY A MINIATURE COPY OF A BARYE AN ELEPHANT TRUMPETING THE UP FLUNG TRUNK WAS DARKLY STAINED AND STICKY WITH A SHUDDER
8040-260923-0003 SHE DROPPED THE BRONZE AND LOOKED DOWN VICTOR LAY AT HER FEET SUPINE GROTESQUELY ASPRAWL HIS FACE WAS BRUISED AND LIVID THE CHEEK LAID OPEN BY THE BRONZE WAS SMEARED WITH SCARLET
8040-260923-0004 HIS MOUTH WAS AJAR HIS EYES HALF CLOSED HIDEOUSLY REVEALED SLENDER SLITS OF WHITE MORE BLOOD DISCOLOURED HIS RIGHT TEMPLE WELLING FROM UNDER THE MATTED COARSE BLACK HAIR
8040-260923-0005 HE WAS TERRIBLY MOTIONLESS IF HE BREATHED SOFIA COULD DETECT NO SIGN OF IT IN PANIC SHE KNELT BESIDE THE BODY THREW BACK VICTOR'S DINNER COAT AND LAID AN EAR ABOVE HIS HEART AT FIRST IN HER MAD ANXIETY SHE COULD HEAR NOTHING
8040-260923-0006 BUT PRESENTLY A BEATING REGISTERED SLOW AND HARSH BUT STEADY PACED WITH A SOB OF RELIEF SHE SAT BACK ON HER HEELS AND AFTER A LITTLE WHILE GOT UNSTEADILY TO HER FEET
8040-260923-0007 THE HOUSE DOOR CLOSED WITH A DULL BANG AND FROM THE ENTRANCE HALLWAY CAME A SOUND OF VOICES SHE STOOD PETRIFIED IN DREAD TILL THE VOICES FELL AND SHE HEARD STAIRS CREAK UNDER AN ASCENDING TREAD
8040-260923-0008 THUS REMINDED THAT LANYARD'S RETURN MIGHT OCCUR AT ANY MOMENT SHE MADE ALL HASTE TO PATCH UP THE DISARRAY OF VEIL AND COIFFURE FORTUNATELY HER COSTUME PROTECTED BY THE CLOAK OF HEAVY AND STURDY STUFF WAS QUITE UNDAMAGED
8040-260923-0009 NOT TILL ON THE POINT OF LEAVING DID SHE REMEMBER THE PAINTING IT LAY UNHARMED WHERE IT HAD FALLEN WHEN VICTOR SEIZED HER VEIL SHE WAS CALM ENOUGH NOW TO CONSIDER HERSELF FORTUNATE IN FINDING IT SO POORLY SECURED IN ITS FRAME
8040-260923-0010 WITHOUT THE LATTER IT WOULD BE FAR EASIER TO SMUGGLE THE CANVAS AWAY UNDER HER CLOAK IN THE FINAL GLANCE SHE BENT UPON VICTOR'S BEATEN AND INSENSIBLE BODY THERE WAS NO PITY NO REGRET NO TRACE OF COMPUNCTION
8040-260923-0011 WHAT HE HAD SUFFERED HE HAD TEN TIMES NO A HUNDRED A THOUSAND EARNED LONG BEFORE SHE LEFT HIM SOFIA HAD LOST COUNT OF THE BLOWS SHE HAD TAKEN AT HIS HANDS THE INSULTS WORSE THAN BLOWS
8040-260923-0012 THE LESSER INDIGNITIES INNUMERABLE BUT IN THOSE ABOLISHED DAYS SHE HAD NEVER ONCE STRUCK BACK SHE HAD BEEN FAINT OF HEART COWED AND TERRIFIED AND HAD LACKED WHAT TWO YEARS OF SEPARATION HAD GIVEN HER
8040-260923-0013 THAT SPIRITUAL INDEPENDENCE WHICH NEVER BEFORE HAD BEEN ABLE TO REALIZE ITSELF LIFT UP ITS HEAD AND GROW STRONG IN THE ASSURANCE OF ITS OWN INTEGRITY TWO YEARS AGO SHE WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO LIFT A HAND TO VICTOR
8040-260923-0014 NO MATTER HOW SORE THE PROVOCATION TO NIGHT IF SHE HAD ONE REGRET IT WAS THAT SHE HAD STRUCK SO FEEBLY NOT THAT SHE DESIRED HIS DEATH BUT THAT SHE KNEW IT WAS NOW HER LIFE OR HIS
8040-260923-0015 SHE KNEW THE MAN TOO WELL TO FLATTER HERSELF THAT HE WOULD REST BEFORE HE HAD COMPASSED SUCH REVENGE AS THE BASENESS OF HIS DEGENERATE SOUL WOULD DEEM ADEQUATE HALF THE WORLD WERE NOT TOO MUCH TO PUT BETWEEN THEM
8040-260923-0016 IF SHE WERE NOW TO SLEEP OF NIGHTS IN COMFORTABLE CONSCIOUSNESS OF SECURITY FROM HIS QUENCHLESS HATRED CALLOUSLY ENOUGH SHE SWITCHED OFF THE LIGHTS AND LEFT HIM LYING THERE
8040-260923-0017 IN DARKNESS BUT FOR THE ASH DIMMED GLIMMER OF A DYING FIRE IN THE ENTRANCE HALLWAY SHE HESITATED
8040-260923-0018 BUT SEEMINGLY THE NOISE OF THEIR STRUGGLE HAD NOT CARRIED BEYOND THE DOOR THERE WAS NO ONE ABOUT WITH NEITHER HASTE NOR FALTERING WITHOUT THE LEAST MISADVENTURE
8040-260923-0019 SHE LET HERSELF QUIETLY OUT INTO THE EMPTY SILENT RAIN SWEPT STREET AND SCURRIED TOWARD THE LIGHTS OF PICCADILLY BEFORE LONG A CRUISING FOUR WHEELER OVERHAULED HER IN ITS OBSCURE AND STUFFY REFUGE
8040-260923-0020 SHE SAT HUGGING HER PRECIOUS CANVAS AND PONDERING HER PLIGHT IT WAS BORNE IN UPON HER THAT SHE WOULD DO WELL TO LEAVE LONDON YES AND ENGLAND TOO BEFORE VICTOR RECOVERED SUFFICIENTLY TO SCHEME AND PUT A WATCH UPON HER MOVEMENTS
8040-260923-0021 SHE HAD NEED HENCEFORTH TO BE SWIFT AND WARY AND SHREWD A SINGULAR ELATION BEGAN TO COLOUR HER TEMPER A QUICKENING SENSE OF EMANCIPATION NECESSITY AT A STROKE HAD SET HER FREE
8040-260923-0022 BECAUSE SHE MUST FLY AND HIDE TO SAVE HER LIFE SOCIETY HAD NO MORE HOLD UPON HER SHE NEED NO LONGER FIGHT TO KEEP UP APPEARANCES IN SPITE OF HER STATUS AS A WOMAN LIVING APART FROM HER HUSBAND LITTLE BETTER THAN A DIVORCEE
8040-260923-0023 AN ESTATE ANATHEMA TO THE ENGLISH OF THOSE DAYS SHE EXPERIENCED THROUGH THE PLAY OF HER IMAGINATION UPON THIS NEW AND STARTLING CONCEPTION OF LIFE AN INTOXICATING PRELIBATION OF FREEDOM SUCH AS SHE HAD NEVER DREAMED TO SAVOUR
8040-260923-0024 IN THIS HUMOUR SHE WAS SET DOWN AT HER DOOR NONE SAW HER ENTER
8040-260923-0025 SHE MIGHT BE DETAINED HEAVEN ALONE KNEW HOW LATE SHE MIGHT BE BUT SHE HAD HER LATCH KEY AND WAS QUITE COMPETENT TO UNDRESS AND PUT HERSELF TO BED AND THERESE HAD TAKEN HER AT HER WORD SHE WAS GLAD OF THAT
8040-260923-0026 WITH THE CANVAS CLUMSILY HIDDEN UNDER HER CLOAK SO SHE EXERCISED MUCH CIRCUMSPECTION IN SHUTTING AND BOLTING THE DOOR MOUNTED THE STAIRS WITHOUT MAKING ANY UNNECESSARY STIR AND AT THE DOOR OF HER BOUDOIR WAITED
8040-260923-0027 LISTENING FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS IN THE COURSE OF WHICH SHE HEARD OR FANCIED SHE HEARD A SLIGHT NOISE ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE DOOR WHICH MADE HER SUSPECT THERESE MIGHT AFTER ALL STILL BE UP AND ABOUT
8040-260923-0028 THE SOUND WAS NOT REPEATED BUT TO MAKE SURE SOFIA SLIPPED OUT OF HER CLOAK AND WRAPPED IT ROUND THE CANVAS BEFORE SHE WENT IN
8040-260923-0029 BUT THOUGH THE MAID HAD LEFT THE LIGHTS ON SHE WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN NOR DID SHE ANSWER FROM THE BEDCHAMBER WHEN THE PRINCESS CALLED HER
8040-260923-0030 SOFIA THREW THE CLOAK ACROSS A CHAISE LONGUE AND BORE HER PRIZE IN TRIUMPH TO THE ESCRITOIRE IT WAS HER INTENTION TO RIP THE CANVAS OFF WITH A KNIFE TO GET AT THE LETTERS
8040-260923-0031 AND A LONG THIN BLADED SPANISH DAGGER THAT NOW DID SERVICE AS A PAPER KNIFE WAS ACTUALLY IN HER HAND WHEN SHE NOTICED HOW SLIGHTLY THE PAINTING WAS TACKED TO ITS STRETCHER AND FOR THE FIRST TIME WAS VISITED BY PREMONITION
8040-260923-0032 DROPPING THE KNIFE SHE CAUGHT A LOOSE EDGE OF THE CANVAS AND WITH ONE SWIFT TUG STRIPPED IT CLEAR OF THE UNPAINTED FABRIC BENEATH
8040-260923-0033 FORTUNE HAD FAILED HER THEN THE JADE HAD TRICKED HER HEARTLESSLY
8040-260923-0034 VICTOR HAD BEEN BEFOREHAND WITH HER HAD PURLOINED THE LETTERS AND RESTORED THE CANVAS TO ITS FRAME SHE MIGHT HAVE SUSPECTED AS MUCH IF SHE HAD ONLY HAD THE WIT TO DRAW A NATURAL INFERENCE FROM THE WAY THE PAINTING HAD PARTED COMPANY WITH ITS FRAME WHEN SHE DROPPED IT
8040-260923-0035 SO THE LETTERS FOR WHICH SHE HAD RISKED AND SUFFERED SO MUCH MUST BE BACK THERE IN LANYARD'S LODGINGS IN VICTOR'S POSSESSION LOST IRRETRIEVABLY SINCE SHE WOULD NEVER FIND THE COURAGE TO GO BACK FOR THEM
8040-260923-0036 EVEN IF SHE DARED ASSUME THAT VICTOR HAD NOT YET RECOVERED AND ESCAPED OR THAT LANYARD HAD NOT YET COME HOME
8040-260923-0037 TOO LATE SHE UTTERED IN DESPAIR AH MADAME NEVER SAY THAT SHE SWUNG ROUND BUT SHOCKED AS SHE WAS TO THE VERGE OF STUPEFACTION MADE NO OUTCRY THE INTRUDER STOOD WITHIN ARM'S LENGTH
8040-260923-0038 COLLECTED AMIABLE DEBONAIR NOTHING THREATENING IN HIS ATTITUDE
8040-260923-0039 HIS BOW WAS HUMOROUS WITHOUT MOCKERY MADAME LA PRINCESSE DOES ME MUCH HONOUR SHE WAS SILENT ANOTHER INSTANT IN A WIDE STARE COMPREHENDING THE INCREDIBLE
8040-260923-0040 THE LONE WOLF OH COME NOW HE REMONSTRATED INDULGENTLY THAT'S DOWNRIGHT FLATTERY SHE MOVED ASIDE LIFTING A HAND TOWARD THE BELL CORD WAIT
8040-260923-0041 INVOLUNTARILY SHE DEFERRED HER ARM DROPPED
8040-260923-0042 BUT SURELY MADAME LA PRINCESSE MUST APPRECIATE THE POLICE MIGHT BE AT A LOSS TO KNOW WHICH HOUSEBREAKER TO ARREST HE COCKED AN EYE OF MOCKING SIGNIFICANCE TOWARD THE PURLOINED COROT
8040-260923-0043 AND IN SHARP REVULSION OF FEELING SOFIA HAD NEED TO BITE HER LIP TO KEEP FROM LAUGHING SHE HESITATED
