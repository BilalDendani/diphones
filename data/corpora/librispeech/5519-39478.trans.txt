5519-39478-0000 THE NEXT MORNING HE HAD MORE OF A STRUGGLE THAN EVER TO WASH AND DRESS HER INDEED AT ONE TIME NOTHING BUT HOLDING HER BY THE SCRUFF PREVENTED HER FROM GETTING AWAY FROM HIM BUT AT LAST HE ACHIEVED HIS OBJECT AND SHE WAS WASHED BRUSHED SCENTED AND DRESSED
5519-39478-0001 ALTHOUGH TO BE SURE THIS LEFT HIM BETTER PLEASED THAN HER
5519-39478-0002 STILL AT BREAKFAST SHE WAS WELL MANNERED THOUGH A TRIFLE HASTY WITH HER FOOD THEN HIS DIFFICULTIES WITH HER BEGAN FOR SHE WOULD GO OUT BUT AS HE HAD HIS HOUSEWORK TO DO HE COULD NOT ALLOW IT
5519-39478-0003 AT FIRST HE TRIED COAXING HER AND WHEEDLING GAVE HER CARDS TO PLAY PATIENCE AND SO ON BUT FINDING NOTHING WOULD DISTRACT HER FROM GOING OUT HIS TEMPER BEGAN TO RISE AND HE TOLD HER PLAINLY THAT SHE MUST WAIT HIS PLEASURE AND THAT HE HAD AS MUCH NATURAL OBSTINACY AS SHE HAD
5519-39478-0004 BUT TO ALL THAT HE SAID SHE PAID NO HEED WHATEVER BUT ONLY SCRATCHED THE HARDER THUS HE LET HER CONTINUE UNTIL LUNCHEON WHEN SHE WOULD NOT SIT UP OR EAT OFF A PLATE BUT FIRST WAS FOR GETTING ON TO THE TABLE AND WHEN THAT WAS PREVENTED SNATCHED HER MEAT AND ATE IT UNDER THE TABLE
5519-39478-0005 TO ALL HIS REBUKES SHE TURNED A DEAF OR SULLEN EAR AND SO THEY EACH FINISHED THEIR MEAL EATING LITTLE EITHER OF THEM FOR TILL SHE WOULD SIT AT TABLE HE WOULD GIVE HER NO MORE AND HIS VEXATION HAD TAKEN AWAY HIS OWN APPETITE
5519-39478-0006 IN THE AFTERNOON HE TOOK HER OUT FOR HER AIRING IN THE GARDEN SHE MADE NO PRETENCE NOW OF ENJOYING THE FIRST SNOWDROPS OR THE VIEW FROM THE TERRACE NO THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING FOR HER NOW THE DUCKS AND SHE WAS OFF TO THEM BEFORE HE COULD STOP HER LUCKILY
5519-39478-0007 THEY WERE ALL SWIMMING WHEN SHE GOT THERE FOR A STREAM RUNNING INTO THE POND ON THE FAR SIDE IT WAS NOT FROZEN THERE
5519-39478-0008 WHICH WOULD NOT BEAR HIS WEIGHT AND THOUGH HE CALLED HER AND BEGGED HER TO COME BACK SHE WOULD NOT HEED HIM BUT STAYED FRISKING ABOUT GETTING AS NEAR THE DUCKS AS SHE DARED BUT BEING CIRCUMSPECT IN VENTURING ON TO THE THIN ICE PRESENTLY SHE TURNED ON HERSELF AND BEGAN TEARING OFF HER CLOTHES
5519-39478-0009 THEN SHE RAN HITHER AND THITHER A STARK NAKED VIXEN AND WITHOUT GIVING A GLANCE TO HER POOR HUSBAND WHO STOOD SILENTLY NOW UPON THE BANK WITH DESPAIR AND TERROR SETTLED IN HIS MIND SHE LET HIM STAY THERE MOST OF THE AFTERNOON TILL HE WAS CHILLED THROUGH AND THROUGH AND WORN OUT WITH WATCHING HER
5519-39478-0010 AT LAST HE REFLECTED HOW SHE HAD JUST STRIPPED HERSELF AND HOW IN THE MORNING SHE STRUGGLED AGAINST BEING DRESSED AND HE THOUGHT PERHAPS HE WAS TOO STRICT WITH HER AND IF HE LET HER HAVE HER OWN WAY THEY COULD MANAGE TO BE HAPPY SOMEHOW TOGETHER EVEN IF SHE DID EAT OFF THE FLOOR
5519-39478-0011 SILVIA COME NOW BE GOOD YOU SHAN'T WEAR ANY MORE CLOTHES IF YOU DON'T WANT TO AND YOU NEEDN'T SIT AT TABLE NEITHER I PROMISE YOU SHALL DO AS YOU LIKE IN THAT BUT YOU MUST GIVE UP ONE THING
5519-39478-0012 AND THAT IS YOU MUST STAY WITH ME AND NOT GO OUT ALONE FOR THAT IS DANGEROUS IF ANY DOG CAME ON YOU HE WOULD KILL YOU DIRECTLY HE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING SHE CAME TO HIM JOYOUSLY BEGAN FAWNING ON HIM AND PRANCING ROUND HIM SO THAT IN SPITE OF HIS VEXATION WITH HER
5519-39478-0013 AND BEING COLD HE COULD NOT HELP STROKING HER OH SILVIA ARE YOU NOT WILFUL AND CUNNING I SEE YOU GLORY IN BEING SO BUT I SHALL NOT REPROACH YOU BUT SHALL STICK TO MY SIDE OF THE BARGAIN AND YOU MUST STICK TO YOURS
5519-39478-0014 HE BUILT A BIG FIRE WHEN HE CAME BACK TO THE HOUSE AND TOOK A GLASS OR TWO OF SPIRITS ALSO TO WARM HIMSELF UP FOR HE WAS CHILLED TO THE VERY BONE THEN AFTER THEY HAD DINED TO CHEER HIMSELF HE TOOK ANOTHER GLASS AND THEN ANOTHER AND SO ON TILL HE WAS VERY MERRY HE THOUGHT
5519-39478-0015 THEN HE WOULD PLAY WITH HIS VIXEN SHE ENCOURAGING HIM WITH HER PRETTY SPORTIVENESS HE GOT UP TO CATCH HER THEN AND FINDING HIMSELF UNSTEADY ON HIS LEGS HE WENT DOWN ON TO ALL FOURS THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT IS THAT BY DRINKING HE DROWNED ALL HIS SORROW
5519-39478-0016 AND THEN WOULD BE A BEAST TOO LIKE HIS WIFE THOUGH SHE WAS ONE THROUGH NO FAULT OF HER OWN AND COULD NOT HELP IT TO WHAT LENGTHS HE WENT THEN IN THAT DRUNKEN HUMOUR I SHALL NOT OFFEND MY READERS BY RELATING BUT SHALL ONLY SAY THAT HE WAS SO DRUNK AND SOTTISH THAT HE HAD
5519-39478-0017 A VERY IMPERFECT RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HAD PASSED WHEN HE WOKE THE NEXT MORNING THERE IS NO EXCEPTION TO THE RULE THAT IF A MAN DRINK HEAVILY AT NIGHT THE NEXT MORNING WILL SHOW THE OTHER SIDE TO HIS NATURE THUS WITH MISTER TEBRICK FOR AS HE HAD BEEN BEASTLY
5519-39478-0018 MERRY AND A VERY DARE DEVIL THE NIGHT BEFORE SO ON HIS AWAKENING WAS HE ASHAMED MELANCHOLIC AND A TRUE PENITENT BEFORE HIS CREATOR THE FIRST THING HE DID WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF WAS TO CALL OUT TO GOD TO FORGIVE HIM FOR HIS SIN
5519-39478-0019 THEN HE FELL INTO EARNEST PRAYER AND CONTINUED SO FOR HALF AN HOUR UPON HIS KNEES THEN HE GOT UP AND DRESSED BUT CONTINUED VERY MELANCHOLY FOR THE WHOLE OF THE MORNING BEING IN THIS MOOD YOU MAY IMAGINE IT HURT HIM TO SEE HIS WIFE RUNNING ABOUT NAKED
5519-39478-0020 HE HAD MADE A BARGAIN AND HE WOULD STICK TO IT AND SO HE LET HER BE THOUGH SORELY AGAINST HIS WILL FOR THE SAME REASON THAT IS BECAUSE HE WOULD STICK TO HIS SIDE OF THE BARGAIN HE DID NOT REQUIRE HER TO SIT UP AT TABLE
5519-39478-0021 BUT GAVE HER HER BREAKFAST ON A DISH IN THE CORNER WHERE TO TELL THE TRUTH SHE ON HER SIDE ATE IT ALL UP WITH GREAT DAINTINESS AND PROPRIETY
5519-39478-0022 BUT LAY CURLED UP IN AN ARMCHAIR BEFORE THE FIRE DOZING AFTER LUNCH HE TOOK HER OUT AND SHE NEVER SO MUCH AS OFFERED TO GO NEAR THE DUCKS BUT RUNNING BEFORE HIM LED HIM ON TO TAKE HER A LONGER WALK THIS HE CONSENTED TO DO VERY MUCH TO HER JOY AND DELIGHT
5519-39478-0023 HE TOOK HER THROUGH THE FIELDS BY THE MOST UNFREQUENTED WAYS BEING MUCH ALARMED LEST THEY SHOULD BE SEEN BY ANYONE BUT BY GOOD LUCK THEY WALKED ABOVE FOUR MILES ACROSS COUNTRY AND SAW NOBODY ALL THE WAY HIS WIFE KEPT RUNNING ON AHEAD OF HIM
5519-39478-0024 AND THEN BACK TO HIM TO LICK HIS HAND AND SO ON AND APPEARED DELIGHTED AT TAKING EXERCISE AND THOUGH THEY STARTLED TWO OR THREE RABBITS AND A HARE IN THE COURSE OF THEIR WALK SHE NEVER ATTEMPTED TO GO AFTER THEM ONLY GIVING THEM A LOOK AND THEN LOOKING BACK TO HIM LAUGHING AT HIM AS IT WERE FOR HIS WARNING CRY OF
5519-39478-0025 JUST WHEN THEY GOT HOME AND WERE GOING INTO THE PORCH THEY CAME FACE TO FACE WITH AN OLD WOMAN MISTER TEBRICK STOPPED SHORT IN CONSTERNATION AND LOOKED ABOUT FOR HIS VIXEN BUT SHE HAD RUN FORWARD WITHOUT ANY SHYNESS TO GREET HER
5519-39478-0026 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE MISSUS CORK HE ASKED HER MISSUS CORK ANSWERED HIM IN THESE WORDS POOR THING POOR MISS SILVIA
5519-39478-0027 IF YOU DO SHE'LL DO HER BEST TO BE A GOOD WIFE TO YOU
5519-39478-0028 I SAW HER SIR BEFORE I LEFT AND I'VE HAD NO PEACE OF MIND I COULDN'T SLEEP THINKING OF HER SO I'VE COME BACK TO LOOK AFTER HER AS I HAVE DONE ALL HER LIFE SIR AND SHE STOOPED DOWN AND TOOK MISSUS TEBRICK BY THE PAW MISTER TEBRICK UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND THEY WENT IN
5519-39478-0029 WHEN MISSUS CORK SAW THE HOUSE SHE EXCLAIMED AGAIN AND AGAIN THE PLACE WAS A PIGSTYE THEY COULDN'T LIVE LIKE THAT
5519-39478-0030 SHE WOULD DO IT HE COULD TRUST HER WITH THE SECRET HAD THE OLD WOMAN COME THE DAY BEFORE IT IS LIKELY ENOUGH THAT MISTER TEBRICK WOULD HAVE SENT HER PACKING
5519-39478-0031 MOREOVER THE OLD WOMAN'S WORDS THAT IT WAS A SHAME TO LET HER RUN ABOUT LIKE A DOG MOVED HIM EXCEEDINGLY BEING IN THIS MOOD THE TRUTH IS HE WELCOMED HER
5519-39478-0032 BUT WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT MISSUS TEBRICK WAS AS SORRY TO SEE HER OLD NANNY AS HER HUSBAND WAS GLAD IF WE CONSIDER THAT SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP STRICTLY BY HER WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD AND WAS NOW AGAIN IN HER POWER
5519-39478-0033 AND THAT HER OLD NURSE COULD NEVER BE SATISFIED WITH HER NOW WHATEVER SHE DID BUT WOULD ALWAYS THINK HER WICKED TO BE A FOX AT ALL THERE SEEMS GOOD REASON FOR HER DISLIKE AND IT IS POSSIBLE TOO THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN ANOTHER CAUSE AS WELL AND THAT IS JEALOUSY
5519-39478-0034 WE KNOW HER HUSBAND WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO BRING HER BACK TO BE A WOMAN OR AT ANY RATE TO GET HER TO ACT LIKE ONE MAY SHE NOT HAVE BEEN HOPING TO GET HIM TO BE LIKE A BEAST HIMSELF OR TO ACT LIKE ONE
5519-39478-0035 IF WE THINK THAT SHE HAD HAD A SUCCESS OF THIS KIND ONLY THE NIGHT BEFORE WHEN HE GOT DRUNK CAN WE NOT CONCLUDE THAT THIS WAS INDEED THE CASE AND THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER GOOD REASON WHY THE POOR LADY SHOULD HATE TO SEE HER OLD NURSE
5519-39478-0036 IT IS CERTAIN THAT WHATEVER HOPES MISTER TEBRICK HAD OF MISSUS CORK AFFECTING HIS WIFE FOR THE BETTER WERE DISAPPOINTED SHE GREW STEADILY WILDER AND AFTER A FEW DAYS SO INTRACTABLE WITH HER THAT MISTER TEBRICK AGAIN TOOK HER UNDER HIS COMPLETE CONTROL
5519-39478-0037 THE FIRST MORNING MISSUS CORK MADE HER A NEW JACKET CUTTING DOWN THE SLEEVES OF A BLUE SILK ONE OF MISSUS TEBRICK'S AND TRIMMING IT WITH SWAN'S DOWN AND DIRECTLY SHE HAD ALTERED IT PUT IT ON HER MISTRESS AND FETCHING A MIRROR WOULD HAVE HER ADMIRE THE FIT OF IT
5519-39478-0038 THAT IS EITHER A LADY TO WHOM SHE OWED RESPECT AND WHO HAD RATIONAL POWERS EXCEEDING HER OWN OR ELSE A WILD CREATURE ON WHOM WORDS WERE WASTED
5519-39478-0039 AND THEN RAN GAILY ABOUT WAVING HER BRUSH WITH ONLY A FEW RIBANDS STILL HANGING FROM HER NECK SO IT WAS TIME AFTER TIME FOR THE OLD WOMAN WAS USED TO HAVING HER OWN WAY UNTIL MISSUS CORK WOULD I THINK HAVE TRIED PUNISHING HER IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN AFRAID OF MISSUS TEBRICK'S ROWS OF WHITE TEETH
5519-39478-0040 WHICH SHE OFTEN SHOWED HER THEN LAUGHING AFTERWARDS AS IF TO SAY IT WAS ONLY PLAY NOT CONTENT WITH TEARING OFF THE DRESSES THAT WERE FITTED ON HER ONE DAY SILVIA SLIPPED UPSTAIRS TO HER WARDROBE AND TORE DOWN ALL HER OLD DRESSES AND MADE HAVOC WITH THEM NOT SPARING HER WEDDING DRESS EITHER
5519-39478-0041 BUT TEARING AND RIPPING THEM ALL UP SO THAT THERE WAS HARDLY A SHRED OR RAG LEFT BIG ENOUGH TO DRESS A DOLL IN ON THIS MISTER TEBRICK WHO HAD LET THE OLD WOMAN HAVE MOST OF HER MANAGEMENT TO SEE WHAT SHE COULD MAKE OF HER TOOK HER BACK UNDER HIS OWN CONTROL
5519-39478-0042 HE WAS SORRY ENOUGH NOW THAT MISSUS CORK HAD DISAPPOINTED HIM IN THE HOPES HE HAD HAD OF HER TO HAVE THE OLD WOMAN AS IT WERE ON HIS HANDS TRUE SHE COULD BE USEFUL ENOUGH IN MANY WAYS TO HIM BY DOING THE HOUSEWORK THE COOKING AND MENDING
5519-39478-0043 BUT STILL HE WAS ANXIOUS SINCE HIS SECRET WAS IN HER KEEPING AND THE MORE NOW THAT SHE HAD TRIED HER HAND WITH HIS WIFE AND FAILED FOR HE SAW THAT VANITY HAD KEPT HER MOUTH SHUT IF SHE HAD WON OVER HER MISTRESS TO BETTER WAYS AND HER LOVE FOR HER WOULD HAVE GROWN BY GETTING HER OWN WAY WITH HER
5519-39478-0044 BUT NOW THAT SHE HAD FAILED SHE BORE HER MISTRESS A GRUDGE FOR NOT BEING WON OVER OR AT THE BEST WAS BECOME INDIFFERENT TO THE BUSINESS SO THAT SHE MIGHT VERY READILY BLAB FOR THE MOMENT ALL MISTER TEBRICK COULD DO WAS TO KEEP HER FROM GOING INTO STOKOE TO THE VILLAGE
5519-39478-0045 WHERE SHE WOULD MEET ALL HER OLD CRONIES AND WHERE THERE WERE CERTAIN TO BE ANY NUMBER OF INQUIRIES ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON AT RYLANDS AND SO ON BUT AS HE SAW THAT IT WAS CLEARLY BEYOND HIS POWER HOWEVER VIGILANT HE MIGHT BE TO WATCH OVER THE OLD WOMAN AND HIS WIFE
5519-39478-0046 AND TO PREVENT ANYONE FROM MEETING WITH EITHER OF THEM HE BEGAN TO CONSIDER WHAT HE COULD BEST DO SINCE HE HAD SENT AWAY HIS SERVANTS AND THE GARDENER GIVING OUT A STORY OF HAVING RECEIVED BAD NEWS AND HIS WIFE GOING AWAY TO LONDON WHERE HE WOULD JOIN HER
5519-39478-0047 THEIR PROBABLY GOING OUT OF ENGLAND AND SO ON HE KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT THERE WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL OF TALK IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND AS HE HAD NOW STAYED ON CONTRARY TO WHAT HE HAD SAID THERE WOULD BE FURTHER RUMOUR INDEED
5519-39478-0048 THERE WAS A STORY ALREADY GOING ROUND THE COUNTRY THAT HIS WIFE HAD RUN AWAY WITH MAJOR SOLMES AND THAT HE WAS GONE MAD WITH GRIEF
5519-39478-0049 BUT LIKE MOST TITTLE TATTLE TO FILL A GAP AS FEW LIKE TO CONFESS IGNORANCE AND IF PEOPLE ARE ASKED ABOUT SUCH OR SUCH A MAN THEY MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY OR THEY SUFFER IN EVERYBODY'S OPINION ARE SET DOWN AS DULL OR OUT OF THE SWIM
5519-39478-0050 AFTER TALKING SOME LITTLE WHILE AND NOT KNOWING ME OR WHO I WAS TOLD ME THAT DAVID GARNETT WAS DEAD AND DIED OF BEING BITTEN BY A CAT AFTER HE HAD TORMENTED IT HE HAD LONG GROWN A NUISANCE TO HIS FRIENDS AS AN EXORBITANT SPONGE UPON THEM AND THE WORLD WAS WELL RID OF HIM
5519-39478-0051 HEARING THIS STORY OF MYSELF DIVERTED ME AT THE TIME BUT I FULLY BELIEVE IT HAS SERVED ME IN GOOD STEAD SINCE FOR IT SET ME ON MY GUARD AS PERHAPS NOTHING ELSE WOULD HAVE DONE AGAINST ACCEPTING FOR TRUE ALL FLOATING RUMOUR AND VILLAGE GOSSIP
5519-39478-0052 SO THAT NOW I AM BY SECOND NATURE A TRUE SCEPTIC AND SCARCELY BELIEVE ANYTHING UNLESS THE EVIDENCE FOR IT IS CONCLUSIVE
5519-39478-0053 THERE WAS SO MUCH OF IT THAT WAS EITHER MANIFESTLY FALSE AND ABSURD OR ELSE CONTRADICTORY TO THE ASCERTAINED FACTS IT IS THEREFORE ONLY THE BARE BONES OF THE STORY WHICH YOU WILL FIND WRITTEN HERE FOR I HAVE REJECTED ALL THE FLOWERY EMBROIDERIES WHICH WOULD BE ENTERTAINING READING ENOUGH I DARESAY FOR SOME
5519-39478-0054 TO GET BACK TO OUR STORY MISTER TEBRICK HAVING CONSIDERED HOW MUCH THE APPETITE OF HIS NEIGHBOURS WOULD BE WHETTED TO FIND OUT THE MYSTERY BY HIS REMAINING IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY
5519-39478-0055 IT WAS THIRTY MILES AWAY FROM STOKOE WHICH IN THE COUNTRY MEANS AS FAR AS TIMBUCTOO DOES TO US IN LONDON THEN IT WAS NEAR TANGLEY AND HIS LADY HAVING KNOWN IT FROM HER CHILDHOOD WOULD FEEL AT HOME THERE AND ALSO IT WAS UTTERLY REMOTE
5519-39478-0056 WHICH WAS NOW UNTENANTED FOR THE GREATER PART OF THE YEAR NOR DID IT MEAN IMPARTING HIS SECRET TO OTHERS FOR THERE WAS ONLY MISSUS CORK'S SON A WIDOWER WHO BEING OUT AT WORK ALL DAY WOULD BE EASILY OUTWITTED THE MORE SO AS HE WAS STONE DEAF AND OF A SLOW AND SATURNINE DISPOSITION
5519-39478-0057 TO BE SURE THERE WAS LITTLE POLLY MISSUS CORK'S GRANDDAUGHTER BUT EITHER MISTER TEBRICK FORGOT HER ALTOGETHER OR ELSE RECKONED HER AS A MERE BABY AND NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF AS A DANGER HE TALKED THE THING OVER WITH MISSUS CORK AND THEY DECIDED UPON IT OUT OF HAND
5519-39478-0058 SINCE SO FAR SHE HAD GOT MUCH WORK AND LITTLE CREDIT BY IT WHEN IT WAS SETTLED MISTER TEBRICK DISPOSED OF THE REMAINING BUSINESS HE HAD AT RYLANDS IN THE AFTERNOON AND THAT WAS CHIEFLY PUTTING OUT HIS WIFE'S RIDING HORSE INTO THE KEEPING OF A FARMER NEAR BY
5519-39478-0059 FOR HE THOUGHT HE WOULD DRIVE OVER WITH HIS OWN HORSE AND THE OTHER SPARE HORSE TANDEM IN THE DOGCART THE NEXT MORNING THEY LOCKED UP THE HOUSE AND THEY DEPARTED HAVING FIRST SECURED MISSUS TEBRICK IN A LARGE WICKER HAMPER WHERE SHE WOULD BE TOLERABLY COMFORTABLE THIS WAS FOR SAFETY
5519-39478-0060 FOR IN THE AGITATION OF DRIVING SHE MIGHT JUMP OUT AND ON THE OTHER HAND IF A DOG SCENTED HER AND SHE WERE LOOSE SHE MIGHT BE IN DANGER OF HER LIFE MISTER TEBRICK DROVE WITH THE HAMPER BESIDE HIM ON THE FRONT SEAT AND SPOKE TO HER GENTLY VERY OFTEN
5519-39478-0061 SHE WAS OVERCOME BY THE EXCITEMENT OF THE JOURNEY AND KEPT POKING HER NOSE FIRST THROUGH ONE CREVICE THEN THROUGH ANOTHER TURNING AND TWISTING THE WHOLE TIME AND PEEPING OUT TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE PASSING
5519-39478-0062 IT WAS A BITTERLY COLD DAY AND WHEN THEY HAD GONE ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES THEY DREW UP BY THE ROADSIDE TO REST THE HORSES AND HAVE THEIR OWN LUNCHEON FOR HE DARED NOT STOP AT AN INN HE KNEW THAT ANY LIVING CREATURE IN A HAMPER EVEN IF IT BE ONLY AN OLD FOWL ALWAYS DRAWS ATTENTION
5519-39478-0063 THERE WOULD BE SEVERAL LOAFERS MOST LIKELY WHO WOULD NOTICE THAT HE HAD A FOX WITH HIM AND EVEN IF HE LEFT THE HAMPER IN THE CART THE DOGS AT THE INN WOULD BE SURE TO SNIFF OUT HER SCENT SO NOT TO TAKE ANY CHANCES HE DREW UP AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND RESTED THERE THOUGH IT WAS FREEZING HARD AND A NORTH EAST WIND HOWLING
5519-39478-0064 HE TOOK DOWN HIS PRECIOUS HAMPER UNHARNESSED HIS TWO HORSES COVERED THEM WITH RUGS AND GAVE THEM THEIR CORN
5519-39478-0065 RUNNING HITHER AND THITHER BOUNCING UP ON HIM LOOKING ABOUT HER AND EVEN ROLLING OVER ON THE GROUND MISTER TEBRICK TOOK THIS TO MEAN THAT SHE WAS GLAD AT MAKING THIS JOURNEY AND REJOICED EQUALLY WITH HER AS FOR MISSUS CORK SHE SAT MOTIONLESS ON THE BACK SEAT OF THE DOGCART WELL WRAPPED UP
5519-39478-0066 WHEN THEY HAD STAYED THERE HALF AN HOUR MISTER TEBRICK HARNESSED THE HORSES AGAIN THOUGH HE WAS SO COLD HE COULD SCARCELY BUCKLE THE STRAPS AND PUT HIS VIXEN IN HER BASKET
5519-39478-0067 THEY DROVE ON AGAIN AND THEN THE SNOW BEGAN TO COME DOWN AND THAT IN EARNEST SO THAT HE BEGAN TO BE AFRAID THEY WOULD NEVER COVER THE GROUND BUT JUST AFTER NIGHTFALL THEY GOT IN AND HE WAS CONTENT TO LEAVE UNHARNESSING THE HORSES AND BAITING THEM TO SIMON MISSUS CORK'S SON
