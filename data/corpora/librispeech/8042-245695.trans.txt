8042-245695-0000 WE NEXT CONSIDER THE WILL UNDER THIS HEAD THERE ARE FIVE POINTS OF INQUIRY ONE WHETHER THE WILL DESIRES SOMETHING OF NECESSITY TWO
8042-245695-0001 THREE WHETHER IT IS A HIGHER POWER THAN THE INTELLECT FOUR WHETHER THE WILL MOVES THE INTELLECT FIVE WHETHER THE WILL IS DIVIDED INTO IRASCIBLE AND CONCUPISCIBLE FIRST ARTICLE
8042-245695-0002 WHETHER THE WILL DESIRES SOMETHING OF NECESSITY OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE WILL DESIRES NOTHING OF NECESSITY FOR AUGUSTINE SAYS
8042-245695-0003 THAT IT ANYTHING IS NECESSARY IT IS NOT VOLUNTARY BUT WHATEVER THE WILL DESIRES IS VOLUNTARY THEREFORE NOTHING THAT THE WILL DESIRES IS DESIRED OF NECESSITY
8042-245695-0004 FURTHER THE RATIONAL POWERS ACCORDING TO THE PHILOSOPHER
8042-245695-0005 EXTEND TO OPPOSITE THINGS BUT THE WILL IS A RATIONAL POWER BECAUSE AS HE SAYS
8042-245695-0006 THE WILL IS IN THE REASON THEREFORE THE WILL EXTENDS TO OPPOSITE THINGS AND THEREFORE IT IS DETERMINED TO NOTHING OF NECESSITY
8042-245695-0007 THAT ALL DESIRE HAPPINESS WITH ONE WILL NOW IF THIS WERE NOT NECESSARY BUT CONTINGENT THERE WOULD AT LEAST BE A FEW EXCEPTIONS THEREFORE THE WILL DESIRES SOMETHING OF NECESSITY I ANSWER THAT
8042-245695-0008 THE WORD NECESSITY IS EMPLOYED IN MANY WAYS FOR THAT WHICH MUST BE IS NECESSARY NOW THAT A THING MUST BE MAY BELONG TO IT BY AN INTRINSIC PRINCIPLE EITHER MATERIAL AS WHEN WE SAY THAT EVERYTHING COMPOSED OF CONTRARIES IS OF NECESSITY CORRUPTIBLE
8042-245695-0009 OR FORMAL AS WHEN WE SAY THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE THREE ANGLES OF A TRIANGLE TO BE EQUAL TO TWO RIGHT ANGLES AND THIS IS NATURAL
8042-245695-0010 FOOD IS SAID TO BE NECESSARY FOR LIFE AND A HORSE IS NECESSARY FOR A JOURNEY THIS IS CALLED NECESSITY OF END AND SOMETIMES ALSO UTILITY ON THE PART OF THE AGENT A THING MUST BE WHEN SOMEONE IS FORCED BY SOME AGENT SO THAT HE IS NOT ABLE TO DO THE CONTRARY
8042-245695-0011 THIS IS CALLED NECESSITY OF COERCION NOW THIS NECESSITY OF COERCION IS ALTOGETHER REPUGNANT TO THE WILL FOR WE CALL THAT VIOLENT WHICH IS AGAINST THE INCLINATION OF A THING BUT THE VERY MOVEMENT OF THE WILL IS AN INCLINATION TO SOMETHING
8042-245695-0012 SO IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A THING TO BE ABSOLUTELY COERCED OR VIOLENT AND VOLUNTARY BUT NECESSITY OF END IS NOT REPUGNANT TO THE WILL WHEN THE END CANNOT BE ATTAINED EXCEPT IN ONE WAY
8042-245695-0013 THUS FROM THE WILL TO CROSS THE SEA ARISES IN THE WILL THE NECESSITY TO WISH FOR A SHIP IN LIKE MANNER NEITHER IS NATURAL NECESSITY REPUGNANT TO THE WILL
8042-245695-0014 THE WILL MUST OF NECESSITY ADHERE TO THE LAST END WHICH IS HAPPINESS SINCE THE END IS IN PRACTICAL MATTERS WHAT THE PRINCIPLE IS IN SPECULATIVE MATTERS
8042-245695-0015 SINCE THE NATURE OF A THING IS THE FIRST IN EVERYTHING
8042-245695-0016 WE ARE MASTERS OF OUR OWN ACTIONS BY REASON OF OUR BEING ABLE TO CHOOSE THIS OR THAT BUT CHOICE REGARDS NOT THE END BUT THE MEANS TO THE END AS THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
8042-245695-0017 SECOND ARTICLE
8042-245695-0018 WHETHER THE WILL DESIRES OF NECESSITY WHATEVER IT DESIRES OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE WILL DESIRES ALL THINGS OF NECESSITY WHATEVER IT DESIRES FOR DIONYSIUS SAYS
8042-245695-0019 EVIL IS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE WILL THEREFORE THE WILL TENDS OF NECESSITY TO THE GOOD WHICH IS PROPOSED TO IT
8042-245695-0020 FURTHER THE OBJECT OF THE WILL IS COMPARED TO THE WILL AS THE MOVER TO THE THING MOVABLE BUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE MOVABLE NECESSARILY FOLLOWS THE MOVER THEREFORE IT SEEMS THAT THE WILL'S OBJECT MOVES IT OF NECESSITY
8042-245695-0021 FURTHER AS THE THING APPREHENDED BY SENSE IS THE OBJECT OF THE SENSITIVE APPETITE SO THE THING APPREHENDED BY THE INTELLECT IS THE OBJECT OF THE INTELLECTUAL APPETITE WHICH IS CALLED THE WILL BUT WHAT IS APPREHENDED BY THE SENSE MOVES THE SENSITIVE APPETITE OF NECESSITY FOR AUGUSTINE SAYS
8042-245695-0022 IT IS THE WILL BY WHICH WE SIN AND LIVE WELL AND SO THE WILL EXTENDS TO OPPOSITE THINGS THEREFORE IT DOES NOT DESIRE OF NECESSITY ALL THINGS WHATSOEVER IT DESIRES I ANSWER THAT THE WILL DOES NOT DESIRE OF NECESSITY WHATSOEVER IT DESIRES
8042-245695-0023 NOW THERE ARE SOME THINGS INTELLIGIBLE WHICH HAVE NOT A NECESSARY CONNECTION WITH THE FIRST PRINCIPLES SUCH AS CONTINGENT PROPOSITIONS THE DENIAL OF WHICH DOES NOT INVOLVE A DENIAL OF THE FIRST PRINCIPLES AND TO SUCH THE INTELLECT DOES NOT ASSENT OF NECESSITY
8042-245695-0024 BUT THERE ARE SOME PROPOSITIONS WHICH HAVE A NECESSARY CONNECTION WITH THE FIRST PRINCIPLES SUCH AS DEMONSTRABLE CONCLUSIONS A DENIAL OF WHICH INVOLVES A DENIAL OF THE FIRST PRINCIPLES
8042-245695-0025 BUT IT DOES NOT ASSENT OF NECESSITY UNTIL THROUGH THE DEMONSTRATION IT RECOGNIZES THE NECESSITY OF SUCH CONNECTION IT IS THE SAME WITH THE WILL FOR THERE ARE CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL GOODS WHICH HAVE NOT A NECESSARY CONNECTION WITH HAPPINESS BECAUSE WITHOUT THEM A MAN CAN BE HAPPY AND TO SUCH THE WILL DOES NOT ADHERE OF NECESSITY
8042-245695-0026 NEVERTHELESS UNTIL THROUGH THE CERTITUDE OF THE DIVINE VISION THE NECESSITY OF SUCH CONNECTION BE SHOWN THE WILL DOES NOT ADHERE TO GOD OF NECESSITY NOR TO THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE OF GOD BUT THE WILL OF THE MAN WHO SEES GOD IN HIS ESSENCE OF NECESSITY ADHERES TO GOD
8042-245695-0027 JUST AS NOW WE DESIRE OF NECESSITY TO BE HAPPY IT IS THEREFORE CLEAR THAT THE WILL DOES NOT DESIRE OF NECESSITY WHATEVER IT DESIRES
8042-245695-0028 THE MOVER THEN OF NECESSITY CAUSES MOVEMENT IN THE THING MOVABLE WHEN THE POWER OF THE MOVER EXCEEDS THE THING MOVABLE
8042-245695-0029 BUT AS THE CAPACITY OF THE WILL REGARDS THE UNIVERSAL AND PERFECT GOOD ITS CAPACITY IS NOT SUBJECTED TO ANY INDIVIDUAL GOOD
8042-245695-0030 THE SENSITIVE POWER DOES NOT COMPARE DIFFERENT THINGS WITH EACH OTHER AS REASON DOES BUT IT SIMPLY APPREHENDS SOME ONE THING THEREFORE ACCORDING TO THAT ONE THING IT MOVES THE SENSITIVE APPETITE IN A DETERMINATE WAY BUT THE REASON IS A POWER THAT COMPARES SEVERAL THINGS TOGETHER
8042-245695-0031 THEREFORE FROM SEVERAL THINGS THE INTELLECTUAL APPETITE THAT IS THE WILL MAY BE MOVED BUT NOT OF NECESSITY FROM ONE THING THIRD ARTICLE
8042-245695-0032 WHETHER THE WILL IS A HIGHER POWER THAN THE INTELLECT OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE WILL IS A HIGHER POWER THAN THE INTELLECT FOR THE OBJECT OF THE WILL IS GOOD AND THE END BUT THE END IS THE FIRST AND HIGHEST CAUSE
8042-245695-0033 THEREFORE THE WILL IS THE FIRST AND HIGHEST POWER
8042-245695-0034 NOW THE ACT OF THE WILL IN THE NATURAL ORDER FOLLOWS THE ACT OF THE INTELLECT
8042-245695-0035 FURTHER HABITS ARE PROPORTIONED TO THEIR POWERS AS PERFECTIONS TO WHAT THEY MAKE PERFECT BUT THE HABIT WHICH PERFECTS THE WILL NAMELY CHARITY IS MORE NOBLE THAN THE HABITS WHICH PERFECT THE INTELLECT FOR IT IS WRITTEN
8042-245695-0036 IF I SHOULD KNOW ALL MYSTERIES AND IF I SHOULD HAVE ALL FAITH AND HAVE NOT CHARITY I AM NOTHING THEREFORE THE WILL IS A HIGHER POWER THAN THE INTELLECT
8042-245695-0037 THE SUPERIORITY OF ONE THING OVER ANOTHER CAN BE CONSIDERED IN TWO WAYS ABSOLUTELY AND RELATIVELY NOW
8042-245695-0038 BUT RELATIVELY AS IT IS SUCH WITH REGARD TO SOMETHING ELSE IF THEREFORE THE INTELLECT AND WILL BE CONSIDERED WITH REGARD TO THEMSELVES THEN THE INTELLECT IS THE HIGHER POWER AND THIS IS CLEAR IF WE COMPARE THEIR RESPECTIVE OBJECTS TO ONE ANOTHER
8042-245695-0039 SINCE THE OBJECT OF THE INTELLECT IS THE VERY IDEA OF APPETIBLE GOOD AND THE APPETIBLE GOOD THE IDEA OF WHICH IS IN THE INTELLECT IS THE OBJECT OF THE WILL NOW THE MORE SIMPLE AND THE MORE ABSTRACT A THING IS THE NOBLER AND HIGHER IT IS IN ITSELF
8042-245695-0040 AND THEREFORE THE OBJECT OF THE INTELLECT IS HIGHER THAN THE OBJECT OF THE WILL THEREFORE SINCE THE PROPER NATURE OF A POWER IS IN ITS ORDER TO ITS OBJECT IT FOLLOWS THAT THE INTELLECT IN ITSELF AND ABSOLUTELY IS HIGHER AND NOBLER THAN THE WILL
8042-245695-0041 BUT RELATIVELY AND BY COMPARISON WITH SOMETHING ELSE WE FIND THAT THE WILL IS SOMETIMES HIGHER THAN THE INTELLECT FROM THE FACT THAT THE OBJECT OF THE WILL OCCURS IN SOMETHING HIGHER THAN THAT IN WHICH OCCURS THE OBJECT OF THE INTELLECT
8042-245695-0042 THUS FOR INSTANCE I MIGHT SAY THAT HEARING IS RELATIVELY NOBLER THAN SIGHT INASMUCH AS SOMETHING IN WHICH THERE IS SOUND IS NOBLER THAN SOMETHING IN WHICH THERE IS COLOR THOUGH COLOR IS NOBLER AND SIMPLER THAN SOUND FOR AS WE HAVE SAID ABOVE
8042-245695-0043 WHEN THEREFORE THE THING IN WHICH THERE IS GOOD IS NOBLER THAN THE SOUL ITSELF IN WHICH IS THE IDEA UNDERSTOOD BY COMPARISON WITH SUCH A THING THE WILL IS HIGHER THAN THE INTELLECT BUT WHEN THE THING WHICH IS GOOD IS LESS NOBLE THAN THE SOUL THEN EVEN IN COMPARISON WITH THAT THING THE INTELLECT IS HIGHER THAN THE WILL
8042-245695-0044 WHEREFORE THE LOVE OF GOD IS BETTER THAN THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD BUT ON THE CONTRARY THE KNOWLEDGE OF CORPOREAL THINGS IS BETTER THAN THE LOVE THEREOF ABSOLUTELY HOWEVER THE INTELLECT IS NOBLER THAN THE WILL
8042-245695-0045 THE ASPECT OF CAUSALITY IS PERCEIVED BY COMPARING ONE THING TO ANOTHER
8042-245695-0046 WHAT PRECEDES IN ORDER OF GENERATION AND TIME IS LESS PERFECT FOR IN ONE AND IN THE SAME THING POTENTIALITY PRECEDES ACT AND IMPERFECTION PRECEDES PERFECTION
8042-245695-0047 AND IN THIS WAY THE INTELLECT PRECEDES THE WILL AS THE MOTIVE POWER PRECEDES THE THING MOVABLE AND AS THE ACTIVE PRECEDES THE PASSIVE FOR GOOD WHICH IS UNDERSTOOD MOVES THE WILL
8042-245695-0048 THIS REASON IS VERIFIED OF THE WILL AS COMPARED WITH WHAT IS ABOVE THE SOUL FOR CHARITY IS THE VIRTUE BY WHICH WE LOVE GOD FOURTH ARTICLE
8042-245695-0049 BECAUSE THE GOOD APPREHENDED BY THE INTELLECT MOVES WITHOUT BEING MOVED WHEREAS THE APPETITE MOVES AND IS MOVED THEREFORE THE INTELLECT IS NOT MOVED BY THE WILL
8042-245695-0050 FURTHER WE CAN WILL NOTHING BUT WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IF THEREFORE IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE WILL MOVES BY WILLING TO UNDERSTAND
8042-245695-0051 AND SO ON INDEFINITELY WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE THEREFORE THE WILL DOES NOT MOVE THE INTELLECT ON THE CONTRARY DAMASCENE SAYS
8042-245695-0052 IT IS IN OUR POWER TO LEARN AN ART OR NOT AS WE LIST BUT A THING IS IN OUR POWER BY THE WILL AND WE LEARN ART BY THE INTELLECT THEREFORE THE WILL MOVES THE INTELLECT I ANSWER THAT A THING IS SAID TO MOVE IN TWO WAYS FIRST AS AN END
8042-245695-0053 SECONDLY A THING IS SAID TO MOVE AS AN AGENT AS WHAT ALTERS MOVES WHAT IS ALTERED AND WHAT IMPELS MOVES WHAT IS IMPELLED IN THIS WAY THE WILL MOVES THE INTELLECT AND ALL THE POWERS OF THE SOUL AS ANSELM SAYS
8042-245695-0054 THAT POWER WHICH REGARDS THE UNIVERSAL END MOVES THE POWERS WHICH REGARD PARTICULAR ENDS AND WE MAY OBSERVE THIS BOTH IN NATURE AND IN THINGS POLITIC FOR THE HEAVEN WHICH AIMS AT THE UNIVERSAL PRESERVATION OF THINGS SUBJECT TO GENERATION AND CORRUPTION MOVES ALL INFERIOR BODIES
8042-245695-0055 EACH OF WHICH AIMS AT THE PRESERVATION OF ITS OWN SPECIES OR OF THE INDIVIDUAL THE KING ALSO WHO AIMS AT THE COMMON GOOD OF THE WHOLE KINGDOM BY HIS RULE MOVES ALL THE GOVERNORS OF CITIES EACH OF WHOM RULES OVER HIS OWN PARTICULAR CITY
8042-245695-0056 AND THE INTELLECT TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH
8042-245695-0057 AS APPETITIVE OF UNIVERSAL GOOD AND AS A DETERMINATE POWER OF THE SOUL HAVING A DETERMINATE ACT IF THEREFORE THE INTELLECT AND THE WILL BE COMPARED WITH ONE ANOTHER
8042-245695-0058 IS CONTAINED BOTH THE WILL ITSELF AND ITS ACT AND ITS OBJECT WHEREFORE THE INTELLECT UNDERSTANDS THE WILL AND ITS ACT AND ITS OBJECT JUST AS IT UNDERSTANDS OTHER SPECIES OF THINGS AS STONE OR WOOD WHICH ARE CONTAINED IN THE COMMON NOTION OF BEING AND TRUTH
8042-245695-0059 FROM THIS WE CAN EASILY UNDERSTAND WHY THESE POWERS INCLUDE ONE ANOTHER IN THEIR ACTS BECAUSE THE INTELLECT UNDERSTANDS THAT THE WILL WILLS AND THE WILL WILLS THE INTELLECT TO UNDERSTAND IN THE SAME WAY GOOD IS CONTAINED IN TRUTH INASMUCH AS IT IS AN UNDERSTOOD TRUTH AND TRUTH IN GOOD
8042-245695-0060 INASMUCH AS IT IS A DESIRED GOOD
8042-245695-0061 FOR EVERY MOVEMENT OF THE WILL MUST BE PRECEDED BY APPREHENSION WHEREAS EVERY APPREHENSION IS NOT PRECEDED BY AN ACT OF THE WILL BUT THE PRINCIPLE OF COUNSELLING AND UNDERSTANDING IS AN INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE HIGHER THAN OUR INTELLECT NAMELY GOD
8042-245695-0062 AND IN THIS WAY HE EXPLAINS THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO PROCEED INDEFINITELY FIFTH ARTICLE
8042-245695-0063 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT WE OUGHT TO DISTINGUISH IRASCIBLE AND CONCUPISCIBLE PARTS IN THE SUPERIOR APPETITE WHICH IS THE WILL FOR THE CONCUPISCIBLE POWER IS SO CALLED FROM
8042-245695-0064 TO BE ANGRY BUT THERE IS A CONCUPISCENCE WHICH CANNOT BELONG TO THE SENSITIVE APPETITE BUT ONLY TO THE INTELLECTUAL WHICH IS THE WILL AS THE CONCUPISCENCE OF WISDOM OF WHICH IT IS SAID
8042-245695-0065 SIX TWENTY ONE THE CONCUPISCENCE OF WISDOM BRINGETH TO THE ETERNAL KINGDOM THERE IS ALSO A CERTAIN ANGER WHICH CANNOT BELONG TO THE SENSITIVE APPETITE BUT ONLY TO THE INTELLECTUAL AS WHEN OUR ANGER IS DIRECTED AGAINST VICE
8042-245695-0066 TO HAVE THE HATRED OF VICE IN THE IRASCIBLE PART THEREFORE WE SHOULD DISTINGUISH IRASCIBLE AND CONCUPISCIBLE PARTS OF THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL AS WELL AS IN THE SENSITIVE
8042-245695-0067 FURTHER AS IS COMMONLY SAID CHARITY IS IN THE CONCUPISCIBLE AND HOPE IN THE IRASCIBLE PART BUT THEY CANNOT BE IN THE SENSITIVE APPETITE BECAUSE THEIR OBJECTS ARE NOT SENSIBLE BUT INTELLECTUAL THEREFORE WE MUST ASSIGN AN IRASCIBLE AND CONCUPISCIBLE POWER TO THE INTELLECTUAL PART
8042-245695-0068 NAMELY THE IRASCIBLE CONCUPISCIBLE AND RATIONAL BEFORE IT IS UNITED TO THE BODY
8042-245695-0069 EIGHT THEREFORE THE IRASCIBLE AND CONCUPISCIBLE POWERS ARE IN THE WILL WHICH IS THE INTELLECTUAL APPETITE
8042-245695-0070 I ANSWER THAT THE IRASCIBLE AND CONCUPISCIBLE ARE NOT PARTS OF THE INTELLECTUAL APPETITE WHICH IS CALLED THE WILL BECAUSE AS WAS SAID ABOVE
8042-245695-0071 THE VISUAL POWER IS NOT MULTIPLIED ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF COLOR BUT IF THERE WERE A POWER REGARDING WHITE AS WHITE AND NOT AS SOMETHING COLORED IT WOULD BE DISTINCT FROM A POWER REGARDING BLACK AS BLACK
8042-245695-0072 NOW THE SENSITIVE APPETITE DOES NOT CONSIDER THE COMMON NOTION OF GOOD BECAUSE NEITHER DO THE SENSES APPREHEND THE UNIVERSAL
8042-245695-0073 FOR THE CONCUPISCIBLE REGARDS AS PROPER TO IT THE NOTION OF GOOD AS SOMETHING PLEASANT TO THE SENSES AND SUITABLE TO NATURE WHEREAS THE IRASCIBLE REGARDS THE NOTION OF GOOD AS SOMETHING THAT WARDS OFF AND REPELS WHAT IS HURTFUL BUT THE WILL REGARDS GOOD ACCORDING TO THE COMMON NOTION OF GOOD AND THEREFORE IN THE WILL
8042-245695-0074 WHICH IS THE INTELLECTUAL APPETITE THERE IS NO DIFFERENTIATION OF APPETITIVE POWERS SO THAT THERE BE IN THE INTELLECTUAL APPETITE AN IRASCIBLE POWER DISTINCT FROM A CONCUPISCIBLE POWER JUST AS NEITHER ON THE PART OF THE INTELLECT ARE THE APPREHENSIVE POWERS MULTIPLIED ALTHOUGH THEY ARE ON THE PART OF THE SENSES
8042-245695-0075 LOVE CONCUPISCENCE AND THE LIKE CAN BE UNDERSTOOD IN TWO WAYS SOMETIMES THEY ARE TAKEN AS PASSIONS ARISING THAT IS WITH A CERTAIN COMMOTION OF THE SOUL AND THUS THEY ARE COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD AND IN THIS SENSE THEY ARE ONLY IN THE SENSITIVE APPETITE THEY MAY HOWEVER BE TAKEN IN ANOTHER WAY
8042-245695-0076 AND THUS IN THE IRASCIBLE AND CONCUPISCIBLE ARE CHARITY AND HOPE THAT IS IN THE WILL AS ORDERED TO SUCH ACTS AND IN THIS WAY TOO WE MAY UNDERSTAND THE WORDS QUOTED
