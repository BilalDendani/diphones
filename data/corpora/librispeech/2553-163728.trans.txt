2553-163728-0000 COULD NOT FAIRLY BE EXPECTED TO MARCH UP TO VISIBLE MUSKET MOUTHS WE CARED NOT MUCH ABOUT DRILLING OUR FORCES ONLY TO TEACH THEM TO HOLD A MUSKET SO FAR AS WE COULD SUPPLY THAT WEAPON TO THOSE WITH THE CLEVEREST
2553-163728-0001 EYES AND TO GIVE THEM FAMILIARITY WITH THE NOISE IT MADE IN EXPLODING AND WE FIXED UPON FRIDAY NIGHT FOR OUR VENTURE BECAUSE THE MOON WOULD BE AT THE FULL AND OUR POWDER WAS COMING FROM DULVERTON ON THE FRIDAY AFTERNOON
2553-163728-0002 UNCLE REUBEN DID NOT MEAN TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO SHOOTING HIS TIME OF LIFE FOR RISK OF LIFE BEING NOW WELL OVER AND THE RESIDUE TOO VALUABLE
2553-163728-0003 BUT HIS COUNSELS AND HIS INFLUENCE AND ABOVE ALL HIS WAREHOUSEMEN WELL PRACTISED IN BEATING CARPETS WERE OF TRUE SERVICE TO US HIS MINERS ALSO DID GREAT WONDERS
2553-163728-0004 WE WERE TO FALL TO OSTENSIBLY AT THE DOONE GATE WHICH WAS IMPREGNABLE NOW BUT IN REALITY UPON THEIR REAR
2553-163728-0005 FOR I HAD CHOSEN TWENTY YOUNG FELLOWS
2553-163728-0006 AND SOME OF OTHER VOCATIONS
2553-163728-0007 UPON THE WHOLE I REJOICED THAT LORNA WAS NOT PRESENT NOW IT MUST HAVE BEEN IRKSOME TO HER FEELINGS TO HAVE ALL HER KINDRED AND OLD ASSOCIATES MUCH AS SHE KEPT ALOOF FROM THEM
2553-163728-0008 PUT TO DEATH WITHOUT CEREMONY
2553-163728-0009 FOR ALL OF US WERE RESOLVED THIS TIME TO HAVE NO MORE SHILLY SHALLYING BUT TO GO THROUGH WITH A NASTY BUSINESS IN THE STYLE OF HONEST ENGLISHMEN WHEN THE QUESTION COMES TO YOUR LIFE OR MINE
2553-163728-0010 THERE WAS SCARCELY ANY ONE WHO HAD NOT TO COMPLAIN OF A HAYRICK AND WHAT SURPRISED ME THEN NOT NOW WAS THAT THE MEN LEAST INJURED MADE THE GREATEST PUSH CONCERNING IT BUT BE THE WRONG TOO GREAT TO SPEAK OF
2553-163728-0011 THE MOON WAS LIFTING WELL ABOVE THE SHOULDER OF THE UPLANDS WHEN WE THE CHOSEN BAND SET FORTH HAVING THE SHORT CUT ALONG THE VALLEYS TO FOOT OF THE BAGWORTHY WATER AND THEREFORE HAVING ALLOWED THE REST AN HOUR
2553-163728-0012 AND THAT WAS THE PLACE WHERE I HAD BEEN USED TO SIT AND TO WATCH FOR LORNA AND JOHN FRY WAS TO FIRE HIS GUN
2553-163728-0013 AND THE WHITE FOG TREMBLING IN CHORDS AND COLUMNS LIKE A SILVER HARP OF THE MEADOWS AND THEN THE MOON DREW UP THE FOGS AND SCARFED HERSELF IN WHITE WITH THEM AND SO BEING PROUD GLEAMED UPON THE WATER
2553-163728-0014 LIKE A BRIDE AT HER LOOKING GLASS AND YET THERE WAS NO SOUND OF EITHER JOHN FRY OR HIS BLUNDERBUSS I BEGAN TO THINK THAT THE WORTHY JOHN BEING OUT OF ALL DANGER AND HAVING BROUGHT A COUNTERPANE
2553-163728-0015 BECAUSE ONE OF THE CHILDREN HAD A COLD MUST VERITABLY HAVE GONE TO SLEEP
2553-163728-0016 AS MIGHT BE THE WILL OF GOD SO THAT HE WERE COMFORTABLE BUT HEREIN I DID WRONG TO JOHN AND AM READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT FOR SUDDENLY THE MOST AWFUL NOISE THAT ANYTHING SHORT OF THUNDER COULD MAKE
2553-163728-0017 CAME DOWN AMONG THE ROCKS AND WENT AND HUNG UPON THE CORNERS
2553-163728-0018 AND LAY YOUR QUARTER STAFFS ACROSS MY LADS AND KEEP YOUR GUNS POINTING TO HEAVEN LEST HAPLY WE SHOOT ONE ANOTHER
2553-163728-0019 SAID AN OLDISH CHAP BUT AS TOUGH AS LEATHER AND ESTEEMED A WIT FOR HIS DRYNESS YOU COME NEXT TO ME OLD IKE YOU BE ENOUGH TO DRY UP THE WATERS NOW REMEMBER ALL LEAN WELL FORWARD
2553-163728-0020 IF ANY MAN THROWS HIS WEIGHT BACK DOWN HE GOES AND PERHAPS HE MAY NEVER GET UP AGAIN AND MOST LIKELY HE WILL SHOOT HIMSELF I WAS STILL MORE AFRAID OF THEIR SHOOTING ME FOR MY CHIEF ALARM IN
2553-163728-0021 THIS STEEP ASCENT WAS NEITHER OF THE WATER NOR OF THE ROCKS BUT OF THE LOADED GUNS WE BORE IF ANY MAN SLIPPED OFF MIGHT GO HIS GUN
2553-163728-0022 APPREHEND FOR THIS CAUSE I HAD DEBATED WITH UNCLE BEN AND WITH COUSIN TOM AS TO THE EXPEDIENCY OF OUR CLIMBING WITH GUNS UNLOADED BUT THEY NOT BEING IN THE WAY THEMSELVES
2553-163728-0023 ASSURED ME THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR EXCEPT THROUGH UNCOMMON CLUMSINESS AND THAT AS FOR CHARGING OUR GUNS AT THE TOP EVEN VETERAN TROOPS COULD SCARCELY BE TRUSTED TO PERFORM IT PROPERLY IN THE HURRY
2553-163728-0024 AND THE DARKNESS AND THE NOISE OF FIGHTING BEFORE THEM HOWEVER THANK GOD THOUGH A GUN WENT OFF NO ONE WAS ANY THE WORSE FOR IT NEITHER DID THE DOONES NOTICE IT
2553-163728-0025 IN THE THICK OF THE FIRING IN FRONT OF THEM FOR THE ORDERS TO THOSE OF THE SHAM ATTACK CONDUCTED BY TOM FAGGUS
2553-163728-0026 OR ANY ONE ELSE OF OUR PRESENCE WAS THE BLAZING OF THE LOG WOOD HOUSE WHERE LIVED THAT VILLAIN CARVER IT WAS MY ESPECIAL PRIVILEGE TO SET THIS HOUSE ON FIRE
2553-163728-0027 NO OTHER HAND BUT MINE SHOULD LAY A BRAND OR STRIKE STEEL ON FLINT FOR IT I HAD MADE ALL PREPARATIONS CAREFULLY FOR
2553-163728-0028 WHEN I SAW THE HOME OF THAT MAN WHO HAD FIRED SO MANY HOUSES HAVING ITS TURN OF SMOKE AND BLAZE AND OF CRACKLING FURY WE TOOK GOOD CARE HOWEVER
2553-163728-0029 AND PERHAPS THAT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH HIS TAKING THE LOSS OF LORNA SO EASILY
2553-163728-0030 AS I SAVED HIM A FAIR AND HANDSOME LITTLE FELLOW WHOM IF CARVER DOONE COULD LOVE ANYTHING ON EARTH BESIDE HIS WRETCHED SELF HE DID LOVE THE BOY CLIMBED ON MY BACK AND RODE AND MUCH AS I HATED HIS FATHER
2553-163728-0031 AND TO COME AND FIGHT A HUNDRED OF US IN THE SMOKE AND RUSH AND FIRE THEY BELIEVED THAT WE WERE A HUNDRED AND AWAY THEY RAN IN CONSTERNATION TO THE BATTLE AT THE DOONE GATE
2553-163728-0032 WE HEARD THEM SHRIEKING AS THEY WENT A HUNDRED SOLDIERS
2553-163728-0033 PRESENTLY JUST AS I EXPECTED BACK CAME THE WARRIORS OF THE DOONES LEAVING BUT TWO OR THREE AT THE GATE AND BURNING WITH WRATH TO CRUSH UNDER FOOT THE PRESUMPTUOUS CLOWNS IN THEIR VALLEY JUST THEN
2553-163728-0034 THE WAXING FIRE LEAPED ABOVE THE RED CREST OF THE CLIFFS AND DANCED ON THE PILLARS OF THE FOREST AND LAPPED LIKE A TIDE ON THE STONES OF THE SLOPE ALL THE VALLEY FLOWED WITH LIGHT AND THE LIMPID WATERS REDDENED AND THE FAIR YOUNG WOMEN SHONE
2553-163728-0035 A FINER DOZEN OF YOUNG MEN COULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE WORLD PERHAPS NOR A BRAVER NOR A VILER ONE SEEING HOW FEW THERE WERE OF THEM
2553-163728-0036 I WAS VERY LOATH TO FIRE ALTHOUGH I COVERED THE LEADER WHO APPEARED TO BE DASHING CHARLEY FOR THEY WERE AT EASY DISTANCE NOW BRIGHTLY SHONE BY THE FIRE LIGHT YET IGNORANT WHERE TO LOOK FOR US
2553-163728-0037 I THOUGHT THAT WE MIGHT TAKE THEM PRISONERS
2553-163728-0038 THE MEN WHO HAD ROBBED THEM OF HOME OR OF LOVE AND THE CHANCE WAS TOO MUCH FOR THEIR CHARITY
2553-163728-0039 ALL THE REST OF THE DOONES LEAPED AT US LIKE SO MANY DEMONS
2553-163728-0040 NOT SEEING US WELL AMONG THE HAZEL BUSHES AND THEN THEY CLUBBED THEIR MUSKETS OR DREW THEIR SWORDS AS MIGHT BE AND FURIOUSLY DROVE AT US
2553-163728-0041 FOR MY PART ADMIRING THEIR COURAGE GREATLY AND COUNTING IT SLUR UPON MANLINESS THAT TWO SHOULD BE DOWN UPON ONE SO I WITHHELD MY HAND AWHILE FOR I CARED TO MEET NONE BUT CARVER
2553-163728-0042 AND HE WAS NOT AMONG THEM THE WHIRL AND HURRY OF THIS FIGHT AND THE HARD BLOWS RAINING DOWN FOR NOW ALL GUNS WERE EMPTY
2553-163728-0043 AND THAT WAS CHRISTOPHER BADCOCK
2553-163728-0044 HIS LIFE TO GET CHARLEY'S HOW HE HAD FOUND OUT NONE MAY TELL BOTH BEING DEAD SO LONG AGO BUT AT ANY RATE HE HAD FOUND OUT THAT CHARLEY WAS THE MAN WHO HAD ROBBED HIM OF HIS WIFE AND HONOUR
2553-163728-0045 BUT CHARLEWORTH DOONE WAS BESIDE HIM AND ACCORDING TO CAST OF DICE SHE FELL TO CHARLEY'S SHARE
2553-163728-0046 AS WHEN POOR KIT BADCOCK SPIED CHARLEY COMING TOWARDS US WE HAD THOUGHT THIS MAN A PATIENT FOOL A PHILOSOPHER OF A LITTLE SORT OR ONE WHO COULD FEEL NOTHING AND HIS QUIET MANNER OF GOING ABOUT
2553-163728-0047 AND THE GENTLENESS OF HIS ANSWERS WHEN SOME BRUTES ASKED HIM WHERE HIS WIFE WAS
2553-163728-0048 WOULD TURN THE MILD CHEEK TO EVERYTHING
2553-163728-0049 KIT WENT UP TO CHARLEWORTH DOONE AS IF TO SOME INHERITANCE AND TOOK HIS SEISIN OF RIGHT UPON HIM BEING HIMSELF A POWERFUL MAN AND BEGGED A WORD ASIDE WITH HIM
2553-163728-0050 ALL I KNOW IS THAT WITHOUT WEAPON EACH MAN KILLED THE OTHER AND MARGERY BADCOCK CAME AND WEPT AND HUNG UPON HER POOR HUSBAND AND DIED THAT SUMMER OF HEART DISEASE
2553-163728-0051 NOW FOR THESE AND OTHER THINGS WHEREOF I COULD TELL A THOUSAND WAS THE RECKONING COME THAT NIGHT AND NOT A LINE WE MISSED OF IT SOON AS OUR BAD BLOOD WAS UP I LIKE NOT TO TELL OF SLAUGHTER
