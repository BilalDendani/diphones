303-123507-0000 AS I CAME BACK TO MYSELF I GLANCED AT SOLA WHO HAD WITNESSED THIS ENCOUNTER AND I WAS SURPRISED TO NOTE A STRANGE EXPRESSION UPON HER USUALLY EXPRESSIONLESS COUNTENANCE WHAT HER THOUGHTS WERE I DID NOT KNOW FOR AS YET I HAD LEARNED BUT LITTLE OF THE MARTIAN TONGUE
303-123507-0001 ENOUGH ONLY TO SUFFICE FOR MY DAILY NEEDS AS I REACHED THE DOORWAY OF OUR BUILDING A STRANGE SURPRISE AWAITED ME A WARRIOR APPROACHED BEARING THE ARMS ORNAMENTS AND FULL ACCOUTERMENTS OF HIS KIND THESE HE PRESENTED TO ME WITH A FEW UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS
303-123507-0002 AND A BEARING AT ONCE RESPECTFUL AND MENACING LATER SOLA WITH THE AID OF SEVERAL OF THE OTHER WOMEN REMODELED THE TRAPPINGS TO FIT MY LESSER PROPORTIONS AND AFTER THEY COMPLETED THE WORK I WENT ABOUT GARBED IN ALL THE PANOPLY OF WAR
303-123507-0003 FROM THEN ON SOLA INSTRUCTED ME IN THE MYSTERIES OF THE VARIOUS WEAPONS AND WITH THE MARTIAN YOUNG I SPENT SEVERAL HOURS EACH DAY PRACTICING UPON THE PLAZA
303-123507-0004 I WAS NOT YET PROFICIENT WITH ALL THE WEAPONS BUT MY GREAT FAMILIARITY WITH SIMILAR EARTHLY WEAPONS MADE ME AN UNUSUALLY APT PUPIL AND I PROGRESSED IN A VERY SATISFACTORY MANNER THE TRAINING OF MYSELF AND THE YOUNG MARTIANS WAS CONDUCTED SOLELY BY THE WOMEN
303-123507-0005 BUT ARE ALSO THE ARTISANS WHO PRODUCE EVERY MANUFACTURED ARTICLE WROUGHT BY THE GREEN MARTIANS THEY MAKE THE POWDER THE CARTRIDGES THE FIREARMS IN FACT EVERYTHING OF VALUE IS PRODUCED BY THE FEMALES IN TIME OF ACTUAL WARFARE THEY FORM A PART OF THE RESERVES
303-123507-0006 AND WHEN THE NECESSITY ARISES FIGHT WITH EVEN GREATER INTELLIGENCE AND FEROCITY THAN THE MEN THE MEN ARE TRAINED IN THE HIGHER BRANCHES OF THE ART OF WAR IN STRATEGY AND THE MANEUVERING OF LARGE BODIES OF TROOPS
303-123507-0007 THEY MAKE THE LAWS AS THEY ARE NEEDED A NEW LAW FOR EACH EMERGENCY THEY ARE UNFETTERED BY PRECEDENT IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE CUSTOMS HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN BY AGES OF REPETITION
303-123507-0008 THEY HAVE NO LAWYERS I DID NOT SEE THE PRISONER AGAIN FOR SEVERAL DAYS SUBSEQUENT TO OUR FIRST ENCOUNTER AND THEN ONLY TO CATCH A FLEETING GLIMPSE OF HER AS SHE WAS BEING CONDUCTED TO THE GREAT AUDIENCE CHAMBER WHERE I HAD HAD MY FIRST MEETING WITH LORQUAS PTOMEL
303-123507-0009 I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE UNNECESSARY HARSHNESS AND BRUTALITY WITH WHICH HER GUARDS TREATED HER SO DIFFERENT FROM THE ALMOST MATERNAL KINDLINESS WHICH SOLA MANIFESTED TOWARD ME AND THE RESPECTFUL ATTITUDE OF THE FEW GREEN MARTIANS WHO TOOK THE TROUBLE TO NOTICE ME AT ALL
303-123507-0010 I HAD OBSERVED ON THE TWO OCCASIONS WHEN I HAD SEEN HER THAT THE PRISONER EXCHANGED WORDS WITH HER GUARDS AND THIS CONVINCED ME THAT THEY SPOKE
303-123507-0011 WITH THIS ADDED INCENTIVE I NEARLY DROVE SOLA DISTRACTED BY MY IMPORTUNITIES TO HASTEN ON MY EDUCATION AND WITHIN A FEW MORE DAYS I HAD MASTERED THE MARTIAN TONGUE SUFFICIENTLY WELL TO ENABLE ME TO CARRY ON A PASSABLE CONVERSATION
303-123507-0012 AND TO FULLY UNDERSTAND PRACTICALLY ALL THAT I HEARD AT THIS TIME OUR SLEEPING QUARTERS WERE OCCUPIED BY THREE OR FOUR FEMALES AND A COUPLE OF THE RECENTLY HATCHED YOUNG BESIDE SOLA AND HER YOUTHFUL WARD MYSELF AND WOOLA THE HOUND
303-123507-0013 AFTER THEY HAD RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT IT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR THE ADULTS TO CARRY ON A DESULTORY CONVERSATION FOR A SHORT TIME BEFORE LAPSING INTO SLEEP AND NOW THAT I COULD UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE I WAS ALWAYS A KEEN LISTENER ALTHOUGH I NEVER PROFFERED ANY REMARKS MYSELF
303-123507-0014 ON THE NIGHT FOLLOWING THE PRISONER'S VISIT TO THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER THE CONVERSATION FINALLY FELL UPON THIS SUBJECT AND I WAS ALL EARS ON THE INSTANT I HAD FEARED TO QUESTION SOLA RELATIVE TO THE BEAUTIFUL CAPTIVE
303-123507-0015 AS I COULD NOT BUT RECALL THE STRANGE EXPRESSION I HAD NOTED UPON HER FACE AFTER MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE PRISONER THAT IT DENOTED JEALOUSY I COULD NOT SAY AND YET JUDGING ALL THINGS BY MUNDANE STANDARDS AS I STILL DID
303-123507-0016 I FELT IT SAFER TO AFFECT INDIFFERENCE IN THE MATTER UNTIL I LEARNED MORE SURELY SOLA'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE OBJECT OF MY SOLICITUDE SARKOJA
303-123507-0017 HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE AUDIENCE AS ONE OF THE CAPTIVE'S GUARDS AND IT WAS TOWARD HER THE QUESTION TURNED WHEN ASKED ONE OF THE WOMEN WILL WE ENJOY THE DEATH THROES OF THE RED ONE OR DOES LORQUAS PTOMEL JED INTEND HOLDING HER FOR RANSOM
303-123507-0018 AND EXHIBIT HER LAST AGONIES AT THE GREAT GAMES BEFORE TAL HAJUS REPLIED SARKOJA WHAT WILL BE THE MANNER OF HER GOING OUT INQUIRED SOLA SHE IS VERY SMALL AND VERY BEAUTIFUL I HAD HOPED THAT THEY WOULD HOLD HER FOR RANSOM
303-123507-0019 SARKOJA AND THE OTHER WOMEN GRUNTED ANGRILY AT THIS EVIDENCE OF WEAKNESS ON THE PART OF SOLA IT IS SAD SOLA THAT YOU WERE NOT BORN A MILLION YEARS AGO SNAPPED SARKOJA WHEN ALL THE HOLLOWS OF THE LAND WERE FILLED WITH WATER
303-123507-0020 AND THE PEOPLES WERE AS SOFT AS THE STUFF THEY SAILED UPON IN OUR DAY WE HAVE PROGRESSED TO A POINT WHERE SUCH SENTIMENTS MARK WEAKNESS AND ATAVISM IT WILL NOT BE WELL FOR YOU TO PERMIT TARS TARKAS TO LEARN THAT YOU HOLD SUCH DEGENERATE SENTIMENTS
303-123507-0021 AS I DOUBT THAT HE WOULD CARE TO ENTRUST SUCH AS YOU WITH THE GRAVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF MATERNITY I SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH MY EXPRESSION OF INTEREST IN THIS RED WOMAN RETORTED SOLA SHE HAS NEVER HARMED US NOR WOULD SHE SHOULD WE HAVE FALLEN INTO HER HANDS
303-123507-0022 IT IS ONLY THE MEN OF HER KIND WHO WAR UPON US AND I HAVE EVER THOUGHT THAT THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD US IS BUT THE REFLECTION OF OURS TOWARD THEM THEY LIVE AT PEACE WITH ALL THEIR FELLOWS EXCEPT WHEN DUTY CALLS UPON THEM TO MAKE WAR WHILE WE ARE AT PEACE WITH NONE
303-123507-0023 FOREVER WARRING AMONG OUR OWN KIND AS WELL AS UPON THE RED MEN AND EVEN IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES THE INDIVIDUALS FIGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES OH IT IS ONE CONTINUAL AWFUL PERIOD OF BLOODSHED FROM THE TIME WE BREAK THE SHELL UNTIL WE GLADLY EMBRACE THE BOSOM OF THE RIVER OF MYSTERY
303-123507-0024 THE DARK AND ANCIENT ISS WHICH CARRIES US TO AN UNKNOWN BUT AT LEAST NO MORE FRIGHTFUL AND TERRIBLE EXISTENCE FORTUNATE INDEED IS HE WHO MEETS HIS END IN AN EARLY DEATH SAY WHAT YOU PLEASE TO TARS TARKAS
303-123507-0025 HE CAN METE OUT NO WORSE FATE TO ME THAN A CONTINUATION OF THE HORRIBLE EXISTENCE WE ARE FORCED TO LEAD IN THIS LIFE THIS WILD OUTBREAK ON THE PART OF SOLA SO GREATLY SURPRISED AND SHOCKED THE OTHER WOMEN THAT AFTER A FEW WORDS OF GENERAL REPRIMAND
303-123507-0026 THEY ALL LAPSED INTO SILENCE AND WERE SOON ASLEEP ONE THING THE EPISODE HAD ACCOMPLISHED WAS TO ASSURE ME OF SOLA'S FRIENDLINESS TOWARD THE POOR GIRL AND ALSO TO CONVINCE ME THAT I HAD BEEN EXTREMELY FORTUNATE IN FALLING INTO HER HANDS RATHER THAN THOSE OF SOME OF THE OTHER FEMALES
303-123507-0027 I KNEW THAT SHE WAS FOND OF ME AND NOW THAT I HAD DISCOVERED THAT SHE HATED CRUELTY AND BARBARITY I WAS CONFIDENT THAT I COULD DEPEND UPON HER TO AID ME AND THE GIRL CAPTIVE TO ESCAPE PROVIDED OF COURSE THAT SUCH A THING WAS WITHIN THE RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES
303-123507-0028 I DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT THERE WERE ANY BETTER CONDITIONS TO ESCAPE TO BUT I WAS MORE THAN WILLING TO TAKE MY CHANCES AMONG PEOPLE FASHIONED AFTER MY OWN MOLD RATHER THAN TO REMAIN LONGER AMONG THE HIDEOUS AND BLOODTHIRSTY GREEN MEN OF MARS
303-123507-0029 BUT WHERE TO GO AND HOW WAS AS MUCH OF A PUZZLE TO ME AS THE AGE OLD SEARCH FOR THE SPRING OF ETERNAL LIFE HAS BEEN TO EARTHLY MEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME I DECIDED THAT AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY I WOULD TAKE SOLA INTO MY CONFIDENCE AND OPENLY ASK HER TO AID ME
