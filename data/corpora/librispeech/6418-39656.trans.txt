6418-39656-0000 I CANNOT CONVERSE FREELY WITH YOU HERE BECAUSE WE ARE OBSERVED BUT I SHALL RETURN HOME PRESENTLY AND SHALL EXPECT YOU AS SOON AS YOUR DUTY PERMITS RAOUL BOWED AND AT THAT MOMENT
6418-39656-0001 THE PRINCE HAD THAT CLEAR AND KEEN LOOK WHICH DISTINGUISHES BIRDS OF PREY OF THE NOBLE SPECIES HIS PHYSIOGNOMY ITSELF PRESENTED SEVERAL DISTINCT TRAITS OF THIS RESEMBLANCE IT IS KNOWN
6418-39656-0002 THAT IN THE PRINCE DE CONDE THE AQUILINE NOSE ROSE OUT SHARPLY AND INCISIVELY FROM A BROW SLIGHTLY RETREATING RATHER LOW THAN HIGH AND ACCORDING TO THE RAILERS OF THE COURT A PITILESS RACE
6418-39656-0003 WITHOUT MERCY EVEN FOR GENIUS CONSTITUTED RATHER AN EAGLE'S BEAK THAN A HUMAN NOSE IN THE HEIR OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS PRINCES OF THE HOUSE OF CONDE THIS PENETRATING LOOK
6418-39656-0004 THIS IMPERIOUS EXPRESSION OF THE WHOLE COUNTENANCE GENERALLY DISTURBED THOSE TO WHOM THE PRINCE SPOKE MORE THAN EITHER MAJESTY OR REGULAR BEAUTY COULD HAVE DONE
6418-39656-0005 BESIDES THIS THE FIRE MOUNTED SO SUDDENLY TO HIS PROJECTING EYES THAT WITH THE PRINCE EVERY SORT OF ANIMATION RESEMBLED PASSION NOW ON ACCOUNT OF HIS RANK
6418-39656-0006 WITH THE MARKED INTENTION OF BEING SALUTED BY THE ONE
6418-39656-0007 NO MAN BOWED WITH MORE RESERVED GRACE THAN THE COMTE DE LA FERE HE DISDAINED TO PUT INTO A SALUTATION ALL THE SHADES WHICH A COURTIER ORDINARILY BORROWS FROM THE SAME COLOR THE DESIRE TO PLEASE
6418-39656-0008 AND BOWED TO THE PRINCE LIKE A MAN CORRECTING BY SOMETHING SYMPATHETIC AND UNDEFINABLE THAT WHICH MIGHT HAVE APPEARED OFFENSIVE TO THE PRIDE OF THE HIGHEST RANK IN THE INFLEXIBILITY OF HIS ATTITUDE
6418-39656-0009 ONE OF THE MOST HONORABLE MEN IN THE KINGDOM CONTINUED THE PRINCE ONE OF THE FIRST GENTLEMEN OF FRANCE AND OF WHOM I HAVE HEARD SO MUCH THAT I HAVE FREQUENTLY DESIRED TO NUMBER HIM AMONG MY FRIENDS
6418-39656-0010 AN HONOR OF WHICH I SHOULD BE UNWORTHY REPLIED ATHOS BUT FOR THE RESPECT AND ADMIRATION I ENTERTAIN FOR YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
6418-39656-0011 AND IT IS PLAINLY SEEN THAT HE HAS BEEN TO A GOOD SCHOOL
6418-39656-0012 IN YOUR TIME GENERALS HAD SOLDIERS THAT IS TRUE MY LORD BUT NOWADAYS SOLDIERS HAVE GENERALS THIS COMPLIMENT WHICH SAVORED SO LITTLE OF FLATTERY GAVE A THRILL OF JOY
6418-39656-0013 TO THE MAN WHOM ALREADY EUROPE CONSIDERED A HERO AND WHO MIGHT BE THOUGHT TO BE SATIATED WITH PRAISE I REGRET VERY MUCH CONTINUED THE PRINCE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE RETIRED FROM THE SERVICE MONSIEUR LE COMTE
6418-39656-0014 FOR IT IS MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT THE KING WILL SOON HAVE A WAR WITH HOLLAND OR ENGLAND AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISTINGUISHING HIMSELF WOULD NOT BE WANTING FOR A MAN WHO LIKE YOU KNOWS GREAT BRITAIN AS WELL AS YOU DO FRANCE
6418-39656-0015 I BELIEVE I MAY SAY MONSEIGNEUR THAT I HAVE ACTED WISELY IN RETIRING FROM THE SERVICE
6418-39656-0016 FRANCE AND GREAT BRITAIN WILL HENCEFORWARD LIVE LIKE TWO SISTERS IF I CAN TRUST MY PRESENTIMENTS YOUR PRESENTIMENTS
6418-39656-0017 LISTEN TO WHAT IS BEING SAID YONDER AT THE TABLE OF MY LORD THE CARDINAL WHERE THEY ARE PLAYING YES MY LORD THE CARDINAL HAD JUST RAISED HIMSELF ON ONE ELBOW AND MADE A SIGN TO THE KING'S BROTHER WHO WENT TO HIM MY LORD
6418-39656-0018 SAID THE CARDINAL PICK UP IF YOU PLEASE ALL THOSE GOLD CROWNS AND HE POINTED TO THE ENORMOUS PILE OF YELLOW AND GLITTERING PIECES WHICH THE COMTE DE GUICHE HAD RAISED BY DEGREES BEFORE HIM
6418-39656-0019 BY A SURPRISING RUN OF LUCK AT PLAY FOR ME CRIED THE DUC D'ANJOU THOSE FIFTY THOUSAND CROWNS YES MONSEIGNEUR THEY ARE YOURS DO YOU
6418-39656-0020 GIVE THEM TO ME I HAVE BEEN PLAYING ON YOUR ACCOUNT MONSEIGNEUR REPLIED THE CARDINAL GETTING WEAKER AND WEAKER AS IF THIS EFFORT OF GIVING MONEY HAD EXHAUSTED ALL HIS PHYSICAL AND MORAL FACULTIES OH GOOD HEAVENS
6418-39656-0021 EXCLAIMED PHILIP WILD WITH JOY WHAT A FORTUNATE DAY AND HE HIMSELF MAKING A RAKE OF HIS FINGERS DREW A PART OF THE SUM INTO HIS POCKETS WHICH HE FILLED AND STILL FULL A THIRD REMAINED ON THE TABLE
6418-39656-0022 WAS CONSIDERED BY THE PERSONS PRESENT ONLY AS A TOUCHING KIND OF FAMILY FETE THE CARDINAL ASSUMED THE AIRS OF A FATHER WITH THE SONS OF FRANCE AND THE TWO PRINCES HAD GROWN UP UNDER HIS WING
6418-39656-0023 NO ONE THEN IMPUTED TO PRIDE OR EVEN IMPERTINENCE AS WOULD BE DONE NOWADAYS THIS LIBERALITY ON THE PART OF THE FIRST MINISTER THE COURTIERS WERE SATISFIED WITH ENVYING THE PRINCE THE KING TURNED AWAY HIS HEAD
6418-39656-0024 SAID THE YOUNG PRINCE JOYOUSLY AS HE CROSSED THE CHAMBER WITH HIS FAVORITE TO GO TO HIS CARRIAGE NO NEVER WHAT A WEIGHT THESE CROWNS ARE
6418-39656-0025 OF THE COMTE DE LA FERE HE MUST BE VERY ILL THE DEAR CARDINAL
6418-39656-0026 HE LOOKS VERY ILL AS YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS MAY PERCEIVE BUT SURELY HE WILL DIE OF IT
6418-39656-0027 OH IT IS INCREDIBLE BUT COMTE TELL ME A REASON FOR IT PATIENCE MONSEIGNEUR I BEG OF YOU
6418-39656-0028 TALKING WITH THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE I SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THEY SPARED US THE TROUBLE OF BEING INDISCREET LISTEN TO THEM IN FACT THE CHEVALIER SAID TO THE PRINCE IN A LOW VOICE
6418-39656-0029 TAKE CARE YOU WILL LET SOME OF THE PIECES FALL MY LORD WHAT DESIGN HAS THE CARDINAL UPON YOU TO MAKE HIM SO GENEROUS AS I SAID WHISPERED ATHOS IN THE PRINCE'S EAR
6418-39656-0030 THAT PERHAPS IS THE BEST REPLY TO YOUR QUESTION TELL ME MY LORD REPEATED THE CHEVALIER IMPATIENTLY AS HE WAS CALCULATING BY WEIGHING THEM IN HIS POCKET THE QUOTA OF THE SUM WHICH HAD FALLEN TO HIS SHARE BY REBOUND
6418-39656-0031 WITHOUT PERCEIVING AT THE MOMENT HE WAS PASSING THE PRINCE AND ATHOS WHO BOTH BOWED RESPECTFULLY THE CHEVALIER DARTED AT THE YOUNG DUKE A GLANCE SO STRANGE AND SO MALICIOUS
6418-39656-0032 THAT THE COMTE DE LA FERE QUITE STARTED ON BEHOLDING IT YOU YOU TO BE MARRIED REPEATED HE OH THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE YOU WOULD NOT COMMIT SUCH A FOLLY BAH I DON'T DO IT MYSELF I AM MADE TO DO IT
6418-39656-0033 COME QUICK LET US GET RID OF OUR MONEY THEREUPON HE DISAPPEARED WITH HIS COMPANION LAUGHING AND TALKING WHILST ALL HEADS WERE BOWED ON HIS PASSAGE THEN
6418-39656-0034 I BELIEVE SO THE PRINCE REFLECTED FOR A MOMENT AND HIS EYE SHOT FORTH ONE OF ITS NOT INFREQUENT FLASHES HUMPH SAID HE SLOWLY AS IF SPEAKING TO HIMSELF
6418-39656-0035 OUR SWORDS ARE ONCE MORE TO BE HUNG ON THE WALL FOR
6418-39656-0036 AND HE SIGHED
6418-39656-0037 FOR HE ALONE HEARD THAT SIGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PRINCE TOOK LEAVE AND THE KING LEFT THE APARTMENT ATHOS
6418-39656-0038 BY DEGREES THE CHAMBER WAS DESERTED
6418-39656-0039 A PREY TO SUFFERING WHICH HE COULD NO LONGER DISSEMBLE BERNOUIN
6418-39656-0040 CRIED HE IN A BROKEN VOICE
6418-39656-0041 SAID HIS EMINENCE I THINK I'M DYING BERNOUIN IN GREAT TERROR RUSHED INTO THE CABINET TO GIVE THE ORDER
