6104-58845-0022 NEWMAN WENT TO HIS CABIN AND THE MUSCLE CALLED MOOSE SPOKE THOUGHTFULLY THAT IS AS NEARLY THOUGHTFULLY AS HIS MENTAL EQUIPMENT WOULD ALLOW I DON'T LIKE THAT APE BOSS BEFORE YOU GUN HIM
6104-58845-0023 IT'LL BE QUITE A WHILE YET BUT THAT'S A PROMISE MOOSE AS SOON AS HIS JOB'S DONE HE'LL WISH HE'D NEVER BEEN BORN UNTIL THEN WE'LL LET HIM THINK HE'S TOP DOG LET HIM RAVE BUT FERDY

6104-58845-0025 BARBARA SAID YOU'RE WORRIED BABE AND EVERYTHING'S GOING SO SMOOTHLY WHY TOO SMOOTHLY ALTOGETHER THAT'S WHY NEWMAN OUGHT TO BE DOING A SLOW BURN AND GOLDBRICKING ALL HE DARES
6104-58845-0026 INSTEAD OF WHICH HE'S HAPPY AS A CLAM AND WORKING LIKE A NAILER AND I WOULDN'T TRUST VINCENT LOPRESTO OR
6104-58845-0027 COULD THEY TED POSSIBLY
6104-58845-0028 THEY COULD AND I'M VERY MUCH AFRAID THEY INTEND TO AS A CREW CHIEF NEWMAN IS A JACK LEG ENGINEER AND A VERY GOOD PRACTICAL TRONCIST
6104-58845-0029 CAN YOU GUESS WITHIN TEN MILLION BUCKS OF HOW MUCH THEY'LL COLLECT BLOCKHEAD DESTON SLAPPED HIMSELF ON THE FOREHEAD I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF THAT ANGLE THAT NAILS IT DOWN SOLID WITH THE ADDED ATTRACTION
6104-58845-0030 JONES WENT ON COLDLY AND STEADILY OF HAVING TWO EXTREMELY DESIRABLE FEMALE WOMEN FOR ELEVEN MONTHS BEFORE KILLING THEM TOO
6104-58845-0031 I'D THINK THEY'D WAYLAY YOU ONE AT A TIME UH UH THE SURVIVOR WOULD LOCK THE SHIP IN NULL G AND IT'D BE LIKE SHOOTING FISH IN A BARREL SINCE WE'RE ALMOST NEVER TOGETHER ON DUTY
6104-58845-0032 THEY'LL THINK UP A GOOD REASON FOR EVERYBODY TO BE TOGETHER AND THAT ITSELF WILL BE THE TIP OFF FERDY WILL PROBABLY DRAW ON ME AND HE'LL KILL YOU JONES SAID FLATLY SO I THINK I'LL BLOW HIS BRAINS OUT TOMORROW MORNING ON SIGHT
6104-58845-0033 AND GET KILLED YOURSELF NO MUCH BETTER TO USE THEIR OWN TRAP WE CAN'T FAST AS YOU ARE YOU AREN'T IN HIS CLASS HE'S A PROFESSIONAL PROBABLY ONE OF THE FASTEST GUNS IN SPACE
6104-58845-0034 YES BUT I'VE GOT A I MEAN I THINK I CAN BERNICE GRINNING OPENLY NOW STOPPED DESTON'S FLOUNDERING IT'S HIGH TIME YOU FELLOWS TOLD EACH OTHER THE TRUTH
6104-58845-0035 BOBBY AND I LET OUR BACK HAIR DOWN LONG AGO WE WERE BOTH TREMENDOUSLY SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT BOTH YOU BOYS ARE JUST AS STRONGLY PSYCHIC AS WE ARE PERHAPS EVEN MORE SO OH SO YOU GET HUNCHES TOO JONES DEMANDED
6104-58845-0036 SO YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF WARNING ALL MY LIFE THE OLD ALARM CLOCK HAS NEVER FAILED ME YET BUT THE GIRLS CAN'T START PACKING PISTOLS NOW I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO SHOOT ONE IF I DID BERNICE LAUGHED
6104-58845-0037 I'LL THROW THINGS I'M VERY GOOD AT THAT HUH JONES ASKED HE DIDN'T KNOW HIS NEW WIFE VERY WELL EITHER WHAT CAN YOU THROW STRAIGHT ENOUGH TO DO ANY GOOD ANYTHING I CAN REACH SHE REPLIED CONFIDENTLY
6104-58845-0038 I'D MUCH RATHER HAVE YOU FELLOWS DO THE ACTUAL EXECUTING I'LL START WEARING A COUPLE OF KNIVES IN LEG SHEATHS BUT I WON'T THROW EM OR USE EM UNLESS I ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO SO WHO WILL I KNOCK OUT WITH THE FIRST CHAIR I'LL ANSWER THAT BARBARA SAID QUIETLY
6104-58845-0039 IF IT'S BLAINE AGAINST BABE IT'LL BE LOPRESTO AGAINST HERC SO YOU'LL THROW YOUR CHAIRS OR WHATEVER AT THAT UNSPEAKABLE OAF NEWMAN I'D RATHER BRAIN HIM THAN ANYONE ELSE I KNOW
6104-58845-0040 BUT THAT WOULD LEAVE THAT GIGANTIC GORILLA TO WHY HE'D LISTEN YOU'LL SIMPLY HAVE TO GO ARMED I ALWAYS DO BARBARA HELD OUT HER HANDS SINCE THEY DON'T WANT TO SHOOT US TWO YET THESE ARE ALL THE WEAPONS I'LL NEED
6104-58845-0041 YOU'RE THAT GOOD REALLY
6104-58845-0042 I'M THAT GOOD REALLY AND BOTH JONESES BEGAN TO REALIZE WHAT DESTON ALREADY KNEW JUST HOW DEADLY THOSE HARMLESS SEEMING WEAPONS COULD BE BARBARA WENT ON WE SHOULD HAVE A SIGNAL IN CASE ONE OF US GETS WARNING FIRST
6104-58845-0043 SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO THEM MUSICAL SAY BRAHMS THAT'S IT THE VERY INSTANT ANY ONE OF US FEELS THEIR INTENT TO SIGNAL THEIR ATTACK HE YELLS BRAHMS AND WE ALL BEAT THEM TO THE PUNCH O K
6104-58845-0044 IT WAS O K AND THE FOUR ADAMS WAS STILL HARD AT WORK IN THE LOUNGE WENT TO BED AND THREE DAYS LATER WITHIN AN HOUR AFTER THE LAST FLIGHT DATUM HAD BEEN PUT IN THE TANK
6104-58845-0045 THE FOUR INTENDED VICTIMS ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE INVEIGLED INTO THE LOUNGE EVERYTHING WAS PEACEFUL EVERYONE WAS FULL OF FRIENDSHIP AND BROTHERLY LOVE BUT SUDDENLY BRAHMS RANG OUT WITH FOUR VOICES IN ABSOLUTE UNISON
6104-58845-0046 NOW IT WAS A VERY GOOD THING THAT DESTON HAD HAD AMPLE WARNING FOR HE WAS INDEED COMPETING OUT OF HIS CLASS AS IT WAS HIS BULLET CRASHED THROUGH BLAINE'S HEAD WHILE THE GUNMAN'S WENT HARMLESSLY INTO THE CARPET
6104-58845-0047 THE OTHER PISTOL DUEL WASN'T EVEN CLOSE LOPRESTO'S HAND BARELY TOUCHED HIS GUN BERNICE EVEN WHILE SHRIEKING THE BATTLE CRY LEAPED TO HER FEET HURLED HER CHAIR AND REACHED FOR ANOTHER BUT ONE CHAIR WAS ENOUGH
6104-58845-0048 THAT FIERCELY BUT ACCURATELY SPED MISSILE KNOCKED THE HALF DRAWN PISTOL FROM NEWMAN'S HAND AND SENT HIS BODY CRASHING TO THE FLOOR WHERE DESTON'S SECOND BULLET MADE IT CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD NOT RECOVER CONSCIOUSNESS BARBARA'S HAND TO HAND ENGAGEMENT
6104-58845-0049 TOOK ABOUT ONE SECOND LONGER MOOSE MORDAN WAS BIG AND STRONG AND FOR SUCH A BIG MAN WAS FAIRLY FAST PHYSICALLY IF HE HAD HAD TIME TO GET HIS MUSCLES READY
6104-58845-0050 WERE LAMENTABLY SLOW AND BARBARA WARNER DESTON WAS ALMOST AS FAST PHYSICALLY AS SHE WAS MENTALLY THUS SHE REACHED HIM BEFORE HE EVEN BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT THIS PINT SIZED GIRL ACTUALLY INTENDED TO HIT HIM
6104-58845-0051 AND THUS IT WAS THAT HIS BELLY MUSCLES WERE STILL COMPLETELY RELAXED WHEN HER SMALL BUT EXTREMELY HARD LEFT FIST SANK HALF FOREARM DEEP INTO HIS SOLAR PLEXUS WITH AN AGONIZED WHOOSH
6104-58845-0052 HE BEGAN TO DOUBLE UP BUT SHE SCARCELY ALLOWED HIM TO BEND HER RIGHT HAND FINGERS TIGHTLY BUNCHED WAS ALREADY BORING SAVAGELY INTO A SELECTED SPOT AT THE BASE OF HIS NECK THEN LEFT HAND AT HIS THROAT AND RIGHT HAND PULLING HARD AT HIS BELT
6104-58845-0053 DESTON AND JONES EACH PUT A BULLET THROUGH THE FALLING HEAD BEFORE IT STRUCK THE RUG BOTH GIRLS FLUNG THEMSELVES SOBBING INTO THEIR HUSBAND'S ARMS
6104-58845-0054 HUH SHE RAISED HER HEAD FROM DESTON'S SHOULDER THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HER STREAMING EYES AND THE RELIEF DAWNING OVER HER WHOLE FACE WAS ALMOST FUNNY WHY I DID THE FOULEST THINGS POSSIBLE
6104-58845-0055 AND AS HARD AS I POSSIBLY COULD I'M SURE I KILLED HIM BY NO MEANS MY DEAR JUDO TECHNIQUES HOWEVER SKILLFULLY AND POWERFULLY APPLIED DO NOT AND CAN NOT KILL INSTANTLY
6104-58845-0056 BULLETS THROUGH THE BRAIN DO I WILL PHOTOGRAPH THE CADAVERS OF COURSE AND PERFORM THE CUSTOMARY POST MORTEM EXAMINATIONS FOR THE RECORD BUT I KNOW ALREADY WHAT THE FINDINGS WILL BE THESE FOUR MEN DIED INSTANTLY OF GUNSHOT WOUNDS
6104-58845-0057 WITH THE FOUR GANGSTERS GONE LIFE ABOARDSHIP SETTLED DOWN QUICKLY INTO A ROUTINE THAT ROUTINE HOWEVER WAS IN NO SENSE DULL THE OFFICERS HAD PLENTY TO DO OPERATING THE WHOLE SHIP
6104-58845-0058 BREAD BOARD HOOKUPS AND IN THEIR SPARE TIME THEY ENJOYED THEMSELVES TREMENDOUSLY IN BECOMING BETTER AND BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR WIVES FOR BERNICE AND JONES LIKE BARBARA AND DESTON HAD FOR EACH OTHER AN INFINITE NUMBER OF ENDLESS
6104-58845-0059 VISTAS OF PERSONALITY THE EXPLORATION OF WHICH WAS SHEEREST DELIGHT THE GIRLS EACH OF WHOM BECAME JOYOUSLY PREGNANT AS SOON AS SHE COULD KEPT HOUSE AND HELPED THEIR HUSBANDS WHENEVER NEED OR OPPORTUNITY AROSE
6104-58845-0060 THEIR BIGGEST CHORE HOWEVER WAS TO SEE TO IT THAT ADAMS GOT SLEEP FOOD AND EXERCISE FOR IF LEFT TO HIS OWN DEVICES HE WOULD NEVER HAVE EXERCISED AT ALL WOULD HAVE GRABBED A BITE NOW AND THEN
6104-58845-0061 AND WOULD HAVE SLEPT ONLY WHEN HE COULD NO LONGER STAY AWAKE UNCLE ANDY WHY DON'T YOU USE THAT BIG BRAIN OF YOURS BARBARA SNAPPED AT HIM ONE DAY FOR A MAN THAT'S ACTUALLY AS SMART AS YOU ARE I SWEAR YOU'VE GOT THE LEAST SENSE OF ANYBODY I KNOW
6104-58845-0062 AND IT IS A TASK FOR A TEAM OF SPECIALISTS AND ALL THE RESOURCES OF A RESEARCH CENTER TO THE OFFICERS HOWEVER ADAMS WENT INTO MORE DETAIL CONSIDERING THE ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF SUPPLIES CARRIED THE SCOPE
6104-58845-0063 QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE SAFETY DEVICES EMPLOYED IT IS IMPROBABLE THAT WE ARE THE FIRST SURVIVORS OF A SUBSPACE CATASTROPHE TO SET COURSE FOR A PLANET AFTER SOME ARGUMENT
6104-58845-0064 CLASSIFY IT OR EVALUATE IT WE ARE CARRYING AN EXTREMELY HEAVY CHARGE OF AN UNKNOWN NATURE THE RESIDUUM OF A FIELD OF FORCE WHICH IS POSSIBLY MORE OR LESS ANALOGOUS TO THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD
6104-58845-0065 THIS RESIDUUM EITHER IS OR IS NOT DISCHARGEABLE TO AN OBJECT OF PLANETARY MASS AND I'M VIRTUALLY CERTAIN THAT IT IS
6104-58845-0066 FROM AN IMPERCEPTIBLE FLOW UP TO ONE OF SUCH VIOLENCE AS TO VOLATILIZE THE CRAFT CARRYING IT FROM THE FACTS ONE THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT FIELD THE SUBSPACE RADIO WILL FUNCTION NORMALLY AND TWO
6104-58845-0067 THAT NO SUBSPACE RADIO MESSAGES HAVE EVER BEEN RECEIVED FROM SURVIVORS THE CONCLUSION SEEMS INESCAPABLE THAT THE DISCHARGE OF THIS UNKNOWN FIELD IS IN FACT OF EXTREME VIOLENCE GOOD GOD
6104-58845-0068 DESTON EXCLAIMED OH THAT WAS WHAT YOU MEANT BY FANTASTIC PRECAUTIONS BACK THERE PRECISELY BUT WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT I DON'T KNOW I SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW
6104-58845-0069 HOWEVER WE HAVE MONTHS OF TIME YET AND IF I AM UNABLE TO ARRIVE AT A CONCLUSION BEFORE ARRIVAL I DON'T MEAN A RIGOROUS ANALYSIS OF COURSE BUT MERELY A STOP GAP EMPIRICAL PRAGMATIC SOLUTION
