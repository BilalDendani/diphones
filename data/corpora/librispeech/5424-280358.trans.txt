5424-280358-0000 AND SHE WAS MOST BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK UPON HER SOFT BROWNY GOLD HAIR WAS SO LONG AND THICK THAT IT WOULD COVER HER FROM THE CROWN OF HER HEAD TO HER LITTLE FEET AND HER DEEP BROWN EYES
5424-280358-0001 LOOK INTO THE FACE OF HER CHILD LOKI THE MISCHIEF MAKER AMONG THE GIANTS OFTEN LOOKED AT SIB AND LONGED TO DO HER SOME EVIL
5424-280358-0002 HE COULD FIND NO ONE WHO DID NOT SPEAK WELL OF HER IT HAPPENED ONE DAY WHEN THE SUMMER WAS NEARLY GONE THAT LOKI FOUND SIB ALONE AND SLEEPING ON A BANK NEAR THE RIVER SO HE DREW HIS KNIFE AND CREEPING SOFTLY NEARER AND NEARER CUT OFF HER BEAUTIFUL FLOWING HAIR QUITE CLOSE TO HER HEAD
5424-280358-0003 AS THE WINDS BLEW IT ABOUT AND THE RAINS BEAT UPON IT AND CRUSHED IT IN BETWEEN THE ROCKS AND STONES WHEN SIB AWOKE AND WAS ABOUT TO PUSH THE HAIR FROM HER FACE SHE FELT THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG
5424-280358-0004 SAW THAT NOTHING BUT A SHORT STUBBLE STOOD UP ALL OVER HER HEAD ALL HER LOVELY HAIR WAS GONE ONLY ONE WOULD HAVE DARED TO TREAT HER SO BADLY
5424-280358-0005 AND TRIED TO SHRINK DEEPER INTO THE CREVICES BETWEEN THE GREAT STONES BUT THE AWFUL SOUND GREW LOUDER
5424-280358-0006 THEN THOR PULLED HIM OUT AND SHOOK HIM FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN HIS ENORMOUS HANDS
5424-280358-0007 TO MAKE SOME GOLDEN HAIR FOR SIB AS GOOD AS THAT WHICH HE HAD DESTROYED
5424-280358-0008 IN THE GREAT CAVERNS WHICH LIE BELOW THE MOUNTAINS AND THESE SONS WERE SMALL AND DARK THEY DID NOT LIKE THE DAYLIGHT FOR THEY WERE DWARFS WHO COULD SEE BEST WITHOUT THE SUN TO DAZZLE THEIR EYES THEY KNEW WHERE GOLD AND SILVER GREW AND THEY COULD TELL WHERE TO FIND BEAUTIFUL SHINING STONES
5424-280358-0009 WHICH WERE RED AND WHITE AND YELLOW AND GREEN THEY KNEW THE WAY ALL OVER THE WORLD BY RUNNING THROUGH CAVERNS AND PASSAGES UNDER THE MOUNTAINS AND WHEREVER THEY COULD FIND PRECIOUS STONES OR METALS THEY BUILT A FURNACE AND MADE AN ANVIL AND HAMMER AND BELLOWS
5424-280358-0010 AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS WANTED IN A SMITHY FOR THEY KNEW HOW TO FASHION THE MOST WONDERFUL THINGS FROM GOLD AND IRON AND STONE AND THEY HAD KNOWLEDGE WHICH MADE THEM MORE POWERFUL THAN THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED ABOVE THE GROUND
5424-280358-0011 AND THEN HE PROMPTLY DROPPED INTO IT THERE IN A DARK CAVE GLEAMING WITH MANY SPARKLING LIGHTS HE WENT TO THE TWO
5424-280358-0012 THAT HE WOULD BE IN SORE TROUBLE WITH THOR
5424-280358-0013 NOW SINDRI AND BROK KNEW ALL ABOUT LOKI PERFECTLY WELL THEY KNEW ALL ABOUT HIS MISCHIEVOUS WAYS AND THE EVIL HE SO OFTEN WROUGHT BUT AS THEY LIKED THOR AND SIB THEY WERE WILLING TO GIVE THE HELP WHICH WAS ASKED OF THEM THUS WITHOUT MORE ADO FOR THESE DWARFS NEVER WASTED THEIR WORDS
5424-280358-0014 SINDRI AND BROK BEGAN THEIR WORK HUGE BLOCKS OF EARTH BROWN STONE WERE CAST INTO THE FURNACE UNTIL THEY WERE IN A WHITE HEAT WHEN DROP BY DROP RED GOLD TRICKLED FROM THEM INTO THE ASHES
5424-280358-0015 THIS WAS ALL GATHERED TOGETHER AND THE GLISTENING HEAP TAKEN TO THE DWARF WOMEN WHO CRUSHING IT IN THEIR HANDS BEFORE IT HAD HARDENED DREW IT OUT UPON THEIR WHEELS AND SPUN IT INTO FINE SOFT HAIR
5424-280358-0016 WHILE THEY WERE DOING THIS BROK SOUGHT AMONGST HIS TREASURES UNTIL HE FOUND THE BLUE OF THE OCEAN AND THE TOUGH INNER PITH OF AN UNDERGROUND TREE THESE WITH OTHER THINGS WERE CAST INTO THE FURNACE AND AFTERWARDS BEATEN WITH HIS HAMMER AS THE RHYTHMIC STROKES FELL
5424-280358-0017 THE WOMEN SANG A SONG WHICH WAS LIKE THE VOICE OF A STRONG STEADY WIND THEN WHEN THIS WORK WAS FINISHED THE SMITH DREW FORTH A LITTLE SHIP WHICH WAS CAREFULLY PLACED ON ONE SIDE THE THIRD TIME THE DWARF WENT TO A DARK CORNER AND BROUGHT OUT
5424-280358-0018 AN UGLY BENT BAR OF IRON AND THIS WITH TWO FEATHERS FROM THE WINGS OF THE WIND WAS HEATED TO MELTING WHITENESS AND WROUGHT WITH GREAT CUNNING AND EXTREME CARE FOR IT WAS TO BE A SPEAR FOR ODIN HIMSELF THE GREATEST OF ALL THE HEROES
5424-280358-0019 THEN BROK AND SINDRI CALLED LOKI TO THEM AND GIVING HIM THESE THREE THINGS BADE HIM HASTEN BACK TO THE GODS AT ASGARD AND APPEASE THEIR WRATH LOKI HOWEVER WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO FEEL SORRY THAT HE HAD BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL
5424-280358-0020 HE LIKED TEASING FOLK BUT HE DID NOT LIKE HAVING TO ATONE FOR HIS MISCHIEF AFTERWARDS HE TURNED THE MARVELOUS GIFTS OVER SCORNFULLY IN HIS HANDS AND SAID THAT HE DID NOT SEE ANYTHING VERY WONDERFUL IN THEM THEN LOOKING AT SINDRI HE ADDED HOWEVER
5424-280358-0021 NOW THE BROTHER DWARFS HAD NOT BY ANY MEANS EXPECTED GRATITUDE
5424-280358-0022 GOING TO ONE CORNER OF THE SMITHY HE PICKED UP A PIG SKIN AND TAKING THE HAMMER IN HIS HANDS TOLD HIS BROTHER TO BLOW STEADILY
5424-280358-0023 THEN WITH STRENGTH AND GENTLENESS HE WROUGHT WITH HIS TOOLS HAVING CAST NOTHING INTO THE HEAT BUT THE PIG SKIN WITH MIGHTY BLOWS AND DELICATE TOUCHES HE BROUGHT THICKNESS AND SUBSTANCE INTO IT UNTIL A BOARD LOOKED AT HIM FROM THE FLAMES
5424-280358-0024 LOKI FEARING FOR HIS HEAD CHANGED HIMSELF INTO AN ENORMOUS FOREST FLY AND SETTLING UPON BROK'S HAND STUNG WITH VICIOUS FURY
5424-280358-0025 WHOSE BRISTLES WERE OF THE FINEST GOLD
5424-280358-0026 WHICH LOKI KEPT UTTERING SINDRI CHOSE FROM A HEAP OF GOLD THE MOST SOLID LUMP HE COULD FIND AND FLUNG IT INTO THE WHITE FLAMES
5424-280358-0027 AND IN THE GLOW LOKI SAW A BROAD RED RING WHICH SEEMED TO LIVE AND MOVE AGAIN HE TRIED TO SPOIL THE WORK AS A FLY AND BIT DEEPLY INTO BROK'S NECK BUT BROK WOULD NOT SO MUCH AS RAISE HIS HAND TO RID HIM OF THE PAIN
5424-280358-0028 NOW CAME THE LAST TEST OF SINDRI'S CUNNING
5424-280358-0029 OR THE WHOLE OF THEIR WORK WOULD BE USELESS THEN WITH WILD SONGS OF STRENGTH UPON HIS LIPS HE HAMMERED AND TAPPED UNTIL THOSE WHO WERE IN THE CAVE FELT THAT THEY WERE OUT AMONG THE ROARING WAVES THEY COULD HEAR THE ICE MOUNTAINS GRIND AND CRASH TO PIECES
5424-280358-0030 HE KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE HIS OWN RUIN SO
5424-280358-0031 THEN THE DWARF LET GO OF THE BELLOWS FOR ONE MOMENT TO CLEAR HIS EYES
5424-280358-0032 IT WAS NEITHER PRETTY NOR PARTICULARLY LARGE WHILE THE HANDLE WAS AN INCH TOO SHORT BECAUSE OF LOKI'S SPITE THEN BROK AND LOKI SET OUT FOR ASGARD LOKI CARRYING THE THREE WONDERFUL THINGS
5424-280358-0033 WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HIM WHILE BROK CARRIED THE THREE MARVELS WHICH SINDRI HAD SO CUNNINGLY WROUGHT AND ACCOMPANIED THE MISCHIEF MAKER THAT THE GODS MIGHT JUDGE WHO HAD WON THE WAGER SO RASHLY OFFERED BY LOKI
5424-280358-0034 AND FREY SHOULD BE JUDGES IN THIS CASE FIRST LOKI OFFERED TO ODIN THE SPEAR GUNGNER WHICH WAS SO WONDERFULLY MADE THAT IT NEVER FAILED TO HIT THE THING AT WHICH IT WAS THROWN AND IT ALWAYS SPED BACK TO THE HAND WHICH HAD THROWN IT LATER WHEN ODIN CARRIED THIS SPEAR IN BATTLE
5424-280358-0035 BUT IF HE SHOOK IT OVER HIS FRIENDS THEY WERE SO FILLED WITH COURAGE THAT THEY COULD NOT BE CONQUERED THEN THOR RECEIVED THE HAIR
5424-280358-0036 TO FREY THE SHIP WAS GIVEN AND THOUGH IT WAS SO SMALL THAT IT COULD BE FOLDED AND CARRIED IN HIS POCKET WHEN IT WAS PLACED UPON THE WAVES IT WOULD GROW LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD AN ARMY OF WARRIORS WITH ALL THEIR WAR GEAR BESIDES AS SOON AS THE SAILS WERE HOISTED
5424-280358-0037 THE WIND WOULD BLOW IT WHITHERSOEVER IT WAS DESIRED THAT THE SHIP SHOULD GO BROK THEN MADE HIS OFFERINGS AND TO ODIN HE GAVE THE RING DRAPNIR WHICH HAD BEEN MADE WITH SUCH MAGIC SKILL THAT EVERY NINTH NIGHT EIGHT OTHER RINGS DROPPED OFF IT THOUGH
5424-280358-0038 NO ONE COULD SEE HOW THEY CAME THIS THE GREATEST OF THE GODS EVER WORE UPON HIS ARM UNTIL THE DEATH OF HIS BEAUTIFUL SON BALDUR WHEN AS TOKEN OF HIS GREAT LOVE
5424-280358-0039 TO FREY WAS GIVEN THE GOLDEN BOAR WHICH WOULD RUN FASTER THAN ANY HORSE OVER THE SEA OR THROUGH THE AIR AND WHEREVER IT WENT THERE IT WOULD BE LIGHT BECAUSE THE BRISTLES SHONE SO BRIGHTLY TO THOR BROK GAVE THE DULL LOOKING HAMMER
5424-280358-0040 SAYING THAT WHATEVER HE STRUCK WITH IT WOULD BE DESTROYED THAT NO BLOW COULD BE HARD ENOUGH TO HURT IT THAT IF HE THREW IT IT WOULD RETURN TO HIM SO THAT HE COULD NEVER LOSE IT AND THAT AS HE WISHED SO WOULD ITS SIZE BE
5424-280358-0041 IT WAS WITH GREAT JOY THAT THOR TOOK THIS TREASURE KNOWING THAT IN IT HE HAD SOMETHING TO HELP HIM IN FIGHTING THE EVIL RIME GIANTS WHO WERE ALWAYS TRYING TO GET THE WHOLE WORLD FOR THEMSELVES UNTIL DRIVEN BACK BY HIM
5424-280358-0042 LOKI OFFERED TO GIVE ALL SORTS OF THINGS TO SAVE HIMSELF BUT THE DWARF WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ANY OF THEM CATCH ME THEN CRIED THE MISCHIEVOUS ONE BUT WHEN BROK STRETCHED HIS HAND UPON HIM LOKI HAD GONE
5424-280358-0043 AND THAT NOT ONE LITTLE TINY BIT OF HIS NECK MIGHT BE TAKEN OR THE DWARF WOULD HAVE MORE THAN HIS BARGAIN AT THIS BROK CRIED IMPATIENTLY THAT THE HEAD OF A WICKED PERSON WAS OF NO USE TO HIM ALL THAT HE WANTED WAS TO STOP LOKI'S TONGUE
5424-280358-0044 AND HE TOOK A KNIFE AND THREAD AND TRIED TO PIERCE HOLES IN LOKI'S LIPS
5424-280358-0045 IF ONLY I HAD SINDRI'S AWL SIGHED THE DWARF AND INSTANTLY HIS BROTHER'S AWL WAS IN HIS HAND SWIFTLY IT PIERCED THE LIPS OF THE MISCHIEF MAKER AND SWIFTLY BROK SEWED THEM TOGETHER AND BROKE OFF THE THREAD AT THE END OF THE SEWING
