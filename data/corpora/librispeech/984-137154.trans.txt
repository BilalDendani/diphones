984-137154-0000 THE ROMANCE OF ORTHODOXY
984-137154-0001 IT IS CUSTOMARY TO COMPLAIN OF THE BUSTLE AND STRENUOUSNESS OF OUR EPOCH BUT IN TRUTH THE CHIEF MARK OF OUR EPOCH IS A PROFOUND LAZINESS AND FATIGUE AND THE FACT IS THAT THE REAL LAZINESS IS THE CAUSE OF THE APPARENT BUSTLE
984-137154-0002 TAKE ONE QUITE EXTERNAL CASE
984-137154-0003 THERE WOULD BE LESS BUSTLE IF THERE WERE MORE ACTIVITY
984-137154-0004 AND THIS WHICH IS TRUE OF THE APPARENT PHYSICAL BUSTLE IS TRUE ALSO OF THE APPARENT BUSTLE OF THE INTELLECT MOST OF THE MACHINERY OF MODERN LANGUAGE IS LABOUR SAVING MACHINERY AND IT SAVES MENTAL LABOUR VERY MUCH MORE THAN IT OUGHT
984-137154-0005 SCIENTIFIC PHRASES ARE USED LIKE SCIENTIFIC WHEELS AND PISTON RODS TO MAKE SWIFTER AND SMOOTHER YET THE PATH OF THE COMFORTABLE LONG WORDS GO RATTLING BY US LIKE LONG RAILWAY TRAINS WE KNOW THEY ARE CARRYING THOUSANDS WHO ARE TOO TIRED OR TOO INDOLENT TO WALK AND THINK FOR THEMSELVES
984-137154-0006 IT IS A GOOD EXERCISE TO TRY FOR ONCE IN A WAY TO EXPRESS ANY OPINION ONE HOLDS IN WORDS OF ONE SYLLABLE IF YOU SAY THE SOCIAL UTILITY OF THE INDETERMINATE SENTENCE IS RECOGNIZED BY ALL CRIMINOLOGISTS
984-137154-0007 AS A PART OF OUR SOCIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION TOWARDS A MORE HUMANE AND SCIENTIFIC VIEW OF PUNISHMENT YOU CAN GO ON TALKING LIKE THAT FOR HOURS WITH HARDLY A MOVEMENT OF THE GRAY MATTER INSIDE YOUR SKULL BUT IF YOU BEGIN
984-137154-0008 YOU WILL DISCOVER WITH A THRILL OF HORROR THAT YOU ARE OBLIGED TO THINK THE LONG WORDS ARE NOT THE HARD WORDS IT IS THE SHORT WORDS THAT ARE HARD THERE IS MUCH MORE METAPHYSICAL SUBTLETY IN THE WORD DAMN THAN IN THE WORD DEGENERATION
984-137154-0009 HAVE ONE PARTICULAR ASPECT IN WHICH THEY ARE ESPECIALLY RUINOUS AND CONFUSING THIS DIFFICULTY OCCURS WHEN THE SAME LONG WORD IS USED IN DIFFERENT CONNECTIONS TO MEAN QUITE DIFFERENT THINGS THUS TO TAKE A WELL KNOWN INSTANCE THE WORD IDEALIST HAS ONE MEANING AS A PIECE OF PHILOSOPHY
984-137154-0010 AND QUITE ANOTHER AS A PIECE OF MORAL RHETORIC IN THE SAME WAY THE SCIENTIFIC MATERIALISTS HAVE HAD JUST REASON TO COMPLAIN OF PEOPLE MIXING UP MATERIALIST AS A TERM OF COSMOLOGY WITH MATERIALIST AS A MORAL TAUNT
984-137154-0011 SO TO TAKE A CHEAPER INSTANCE THE MAN WHO HATES PROGRESSIVES IN LONDON ALWAYS CALLS HIMSELF A PROGRESSIVE IN SOUTH AFRICA A CONFUSION QUITE AS UNMEANING AS THIS HAS ARISEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORD LIBERAL AS APPLIED TO RELIGION AND AS APPLIED TO POLITICS AND SOCIETY
984-137154-0012 IN ACTUAL MODERN EUROPE A FREETHINKER DOES NOT MEAN A MAN WHO THINKS FOR HIMSELF IT MEANS A MAN WHO HAVING THOUGHT FOR HIMSELF HAS COME TO ONE PARTICULAR CLASS OF CONCLUSIONS
984-137154-0013 THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF MIRACLES THE IMPROBABILITY OF PERSONAL IMMORTALITY AND SO ON AND NONE OF THESE IDEAS ARE PARTICULARLY LIBERAL NAY INDEED ALMOST ALL THESE IDEAS ARE DEFINITELY ILLIBERAL AS IT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS CHAPTER TO SHOW
984-137154-0014 IN THE FEW FOLLOWING PAGES I PROPOSE TO POINT OUT AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE THAT ON EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE MATTERS MOST STRONGLY INSISTED ON BY LIBERALISERS OF THEOLOGY THEIR EFFECT UPON SOCIAL PRACTICE WOULD BE DEFINITELY ILLIBERAL
984-137154-0015 ALMOST EVERY CONTEMPORARY PROPOSAL TO BRING FREEDOM INTO THE CHURCH IS SIMPLY A PROPOSAL TO BRING TYRANNY INTO THE WORLD FOR FREEING THE CHURCH NOW DOES NOT EVEN MEAN FREEING IT IN ALL DIRECTIONS IT MEANS FREEING THAT PECULIAR SET OF DOGMAS LOOSELY CALLED SCIENTIFIC
984-137154-0016 CAN BE SHOWN TO BE THE NATURAL ALLY OF OPPRESSION IN FACT IT IS A REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCE INDEED NOT SO VERY REMARKABLE WHEN ONE COMES TO THINK OF IT THAT MOST THINGS ARE THE ALLIES OF OPPRESSION
984-137154-0017 THERE IS ONLY ONE THING THAT CAN NEVER GO PAST A CERTAIN POINT IN ITS ALLIANCE WITH OPPRESSION AND THAT IS ORTHODOXY I MAY IT IS TRUE TWIST ORTHODOXY SO AS PARTLY TO JUSTIFY A TYRANT BUT I CAN EASILY MAKE UP A GERMAN PHILOSOPHY TO JUSTIFY HIM ENTIRELY
984-137154-0018 NOW LET US TAKE IN ORDER THE INNOVATIONS THAT ARE THE NOTES OF THE NEW THEOLOGY OR THE MODERNIST CHURCH WE CONCLUDED THE LAST CHAPTER WITH THE DISCOVERY OF ONE OF THEM THE VERY DOCTRINE WHICH IS CALLED THE MOST OLD FASHIONED WAS FOUND TO BE THE ONLY SAFEGUARD OF THE NEW DEMOCRACIES OF THE EARTH
984-137154-0019 THE DOCTRINE SEEMINGLY MOST UNPOPULAR WAS FOUND TO BE THE ONLY STRENGTH OF THE PEOPLE IN SHORT WE FOUND THAT THE ONLY LOGICAL NEGATION OF OLIGARCHY WAS IN THE AFFIRMATION OF ORIGINAL SIN SO IT IS I MAINTAIN IN ALL THE OTHER CASES
984-137154-0020 I TAKE THE MOST OBVIOUS INSTANCE FIRST THE CASE OF MIRACLES FOR SOME EXTRAORDINARY REASON THERE IS A FIXED NOTION THAT IT IS MORE LIBERAL TO DISBELIEVE IN MIRACLES THAN TO BELIEVE IN THEM
984-137154-0021 YET HOW RARELY DO WE FIND TROUBLE IN A PARISH BECAUSE THE CLERGYMAN SAYS THAT HIS FATHER WALKED ON THE SERPENTINE
984-137154-0022 MORE SUPERNATURAL THINGS ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE HAPPENED IN OUR TIME THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE EIGHTY YEARS AGO MEN OF SCIENCE BELIEVE IN SUCH MARVELS MUCH MORE THAN THEY DID
984-137154-0023 THE MOST PERPLEXING AND EVEN HORRIBLE PRODIGIES OF MIND AND SPIRIT ARE ALWAYS BEING UNVEILED IN MODERN PSYCHOLOGY THINGS THAT THE OLD SCIENCE AT LEAST WOULD FRANKLY HAVE REJECTED AS MIRACLES ARE HOURLY BEING ASSERTED BY THE NEW SCIENCE
984-137154-0024 THE ONLY THING WHICH IS STILL OLD FASHIONED ENOUGH TO REJECT MIRACLES IS THE NEW THEOLOGY BUT IN TRUTH THIS NOTION THAT IT IS FREE TO DENY MIRACLES HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EVIDENCE FOR OR AGAINST THEM IT IS A LIFELESS VERBAL PREJUDICE OF WHICH THE ORIGINAL LIFE AND BEGINNING
984-137154-0025 WAS NOT IN THE FREEDOM OF THOUGHT BUT SIMPLY IN THE DOGMA OF MATERIALISM THE MAN OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY DID NOT DISBELIEVE IN THE RESURRECTION BECAUSE HIS LIBERAL CHRISTIANITY ALLOWED HIM TO DOUBT IT HE DISBELIEVED IN IT BECAUSE HIS VERY STRICT MATERIALISM DID NOT ALLOW HIM TO BELIEVE IT
984-137154-0026 TENNYSON A VERY TYPICAL NINETEENTH CENTURY MAN UTTERED ONE OF THE INSTINCTIVE TRUISMS OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES WHEN HE SAID THAT THERE WAS FAITH IN THEIR HONEST DOUBT THERE WAS INDEED THOSE WORDS HAVE A PROFOUND AND EVEN A HORRIBLE TRUTH
984-137154-0027 IN THEIR DOUBT OF MIRACLES THERE WAS A FAITH IN A FIXED AND GODLESS FATE A DEEP AND SINCERE FAITH IN THE INCURABLE ROUTINE OF THE COSMOS THE DOUBTS OF THE AGNOSTIC WERE ONLY THE DOGMAS OF THE MONIST
984-137154-0028 OF THE FACT AND EVIDENCE OF THE SUPERNATURAL I WILL SPEAK AFTERWARDS HERE WE ARE ONLY CONCERNED WITH THIS CLEAR POINT
984-137154-0029 REFORM OR IN THE ONLY TOLERABLE SENSE PROGRESS MEANS SIMPLY THE GRADUAL CONTROL OF MATTER BY MIND A MIRACLE SIMPLY MEANS THE SWIFT CONTROL OF MATTER BY MIND IF YOU WISH TO FEED THE PEOPLE YOU MAY THINK THAT FEEDING THEM MIRACULOUSLY IN THE WILDERNESS IS IMPOSSIBLE
984-137154-0030 BUT YOU CANNOT THINK IT ILLIBERAL IF YOU REALLY WANT POOR CHILDREN TO GO TO THE SEASIDE YOU CANNOT THINK IT ILLIBERAL THAT THEY SHOULD GO THERE ON FLYING DRAGONS YOU CAN ONLY THINK IT UNLIKELY A HOLIDAY LIKE LIBERALISM ONLY MEANS THE LIBERTY OF MAN
984-137154-0031 A MIRACLE ONLY MEANS THE LIBERTY OF GOD YOU MAY CONSCIENTIOUSLY DENY EITHER OF THEM BUT YOU CANNOT CALL YOUR DENIAL A TRIUMPH OF THE LIBERAL IDEA THE CATHOLIC CHURCH BELIEVED THAT MAN AND GOD BOTH HAD A SORT OF SPIRITUAL FREEDOM
984-137154-0032 CALVINISM TOOK AWAY THE FREEDOM FROM MAN BUT LEFT IT TO GOD SCIENTIFIC MATERIALISM BINDS THE CREATOR HIMSELF IT CHAINS UP GOD AS THE APOCALYPSE CHAINED THE DEVIL IT LEAVES NOTHING FREE IN THE UNIVERSE AND THOSE WHO ASSIST THIS PROCESS ARE CALLED THE LIBERAL THEOLOGIANS
984-137154-0033 THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE DOUBT OF MIRACLES AKIN TO LIBERALITY OR REFORM IS LITERALLY THE OPPOSITE OF THE TRUTH IF A MAN CANNOT BELIEVE IN MIRACLES THERE IS AN END OF THE MATTER HE IS NOT PARTICULARLY LIBERAL BUT HE IS PERFECTLY HONOURABLE AND LOGICAL WHICH ARE MUCH BETTER THINGS
984-137154-0034 BUT IF HE CAN BELIEVE IN MIRACLES HE IS CERTAINLY THE MORE LIBERAL FOR DOING SO BECAUSE THEY MEAN FIRST THE FREEDOM OF THE SOUL AND SECONDLY ITS CONTROL OVER THE TYRANNY OF CIRCUMSTANCE SOMETIMES THIS TRUTH IS IGNORED IN A SINGULARLY NAIVE WAY EVEN BY THE ABLEST MEN
984-137154-0035 FOR INSTANCE MISTER BERNARD SHAW SPEAKS WITH HEARTY OLD FASHIONED CONTEMPT FOR THE IDEA OF MIRACLES
984-137154-0036 HE SEEMS STRANGELY UNCONSCIOUS THAT MIRACLES ARE ONLY THE FINAL FLOWERS OF HIS OWN FAVOURITE TREE THE DOCTRINE OF THE OMNIPOTENCE OF WILL JUST IN THE SAME WAY HE CALLS THE DESIRE FOR IMMORTALITY A PALTRY SELFISHNESS
984-137154-0037 HOW CAN IT BE NOBLE TO WISH TO MAKE ONE'S LIFE INFINITE AND YET MEAN TO WISH TO MAKE IT IMMORTAL NO IF IT IS DESIRABLE THAT MAN SHOULD TRIUMPH OVER THE CRUELTY OF NATURE OR CUSTOM
984-137154-0038 BUT I MUST PASS ON TO THE LARGER CASES OF THIS CURIOUS ERROR THE NOTION THAT THE LIBERALISING OF RELIGION IN SOME WAY HELPS THE LIBERATION OF THE WORLD THE SECOND EXAMPLE OF IT CAN BE FOUND IN THE QUESTION OF PANTHEISM
984-137154-0039 OR RATHER OF A CERTAIN MODERN ATTITUDE WHICH IS OFTEN CALLED IMMANENTISM AND WHICH OFTEN IS BUDDHISM BUT THIS IS SO MUCH MORE DIFFICULT A MATTER THAT I MUST APPROACH IT WITH RATHER MORE PREPARATION
984-137154-0040 HERE IS A CASE THERE IS A PHRASE OF FACILE LIBERALITY UTTERED AGAIN AND AGAIN AT ETHICAL SOCIETIES AND PARLIAMENTS OF RELIGION
984-137154-0041 THE RELIGIONS OF THE EARTH DO NOT GREATLY DIFFER IN RITES AND FORMS THEY DO GREATLY DIFFER IN WHAT THEY TEACH IT IS AS IF A MAN WERE TO SAY DO NOT BE MISLED BY THE FACT THAT THE CHURCH TIMES AND THE FREETHINKER LOOK UTTERLY DIFFERENT THAT ONE IS PAINTED ON VELLUM AND THE OTHER CARVED ON MARBLE
984-137154-0042 THAT ONE IS TRIANGULAR AND THE OTHER HECTAGONAL READ THEM AND YOU WILL SEE THAT THEY SAY THE SAME THING
984-137154-0043 AN ATHEIST STOCKBROKER IN SURBITON LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE A SWEDENBORGIAN STOCKBROKER IN WIMBLEDON YOU MAY WALK ROUND AND ROUND THEM AND SUBJECT THEM TO THE MOST PERSONAL AND OFFENSIVE STUDY WITHOUT SEEING ANYTHING SWEDENBORGIAN IN THE HAT OR ANYTHING PARTICULARLY GODLESS IN THE UMBRELLA
984-137154-0044 IT IS EXACTLY IN THEIR SOULS THAT THEY ARE DIVIDED
984-137154-0045 THEY AGREE IN MACHINERY ALMOST EVERY GREAT RELIGION ON EARTH WORKS WITH THE SAME EXTERNAL METHODS WITH PRIESTS SCRIPTURES ALTARS SWORN BROTHERHOODS SPECIAL FEASTS THEY AGREE IN THE MODE OF TEACHING WHAT THEY DIFFER ABOUT IS THE THING TO BE TAUGHT
984-137154-0046 PAGAN OPTIMISTS AND EASTERN PESSIMISTS WOULD BOTH HAVE TEMPLES JUST AS LIBERALS AND TORIES WOULD BOTH HAVE NEWSPAPERS CREEDS THAT EXIST TO DESTROY EACH OTHER BOTH HAVE SCRIPTURES JUST AS ARMIES THAT EXIST TO DESTROY EACH OTHER BOTH HAVE GUNS
984-137154-0047 THE GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS ALLEGED IDENTITY OF ALL HUMAN RELIGIONS IS THE ALLEGED SPIRITUAL IDENTITY OF BUDDHISM AND CHRISTIANITY THOSE WHO ADOPT THIS THEORY GENERALLY AVOID THE ETHICS OF MOST OTHER CREEDS EXCEPT INDEED CONFUCIANISM WHICH THEY LIKE BECAUSE IT IS NOT A CREED
984-137154-0048 BUT THEY ARE CAUTIOUS IN THEIR PRAISES OF MAHOMMEDANISM GENERALLY CONFINING THEMSELVES TO IMPOSING ITS MORALITY ONLY UPON THE REFRESHMENT OF THE LOWER CLASSES
984-137154-0049 THEY FEEL SINCERELY A SIMILARITY STUDENTS OF POPULAR SCIENCE LIKE MISTER BLATCHFORD ARE ALWAYS INSISTING THAT CHRISTIANITY AND BUDDHISM ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE ESPECIALLY BUDDHISM THIS IS GENERALLY BELIEVED AND I BELIEVED IT MYSELF UNTIL I READ A BOOK GIVING THE REASONS FOR IT
984-137154-0050 THE REASONS WERE OF TWO KINDS RESEMBLANCES THAT MEANT NOTHING BECAUSE THEY WERE COMMON TO ALL HUMANITY AND RESEMBLANCES WHICH WERE NOT RESEMBLANCES AT ALL THE AUTHOR SOLEMNLY EXPLAINED THAT THE TWO CREEDS WERE ALIKE IN THINGS IN WHICH ALL CREEDS ARE ALIKE
984-137154-0051 OR ELSE HE DESCRIBED THEM AS ALIKE IN SOME POINT IN WHICH THEY ARE QUITE OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENT THUS AS A CASE OF THE FIRST CLASS HE SAID THAT BOTH CHRIST AND BUDDHA WERE CALLED BY THE DIVINE VOICE COMING OUT OF THE SKY AS IF YOU WOULD EXPECT THE DIVINE VOICE TO COME OUT OF THE COAL CELLAR
984-137154-0052 YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY THAT IT WAS A REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE THAT THEY BOTH HAD FEET TO WASH AND THE OTHER CLASS OF SIMILARITIES WERE THOSE WHICH SIMPLY WERE NOT SIMILAR THUS THIS RECONCILER OF THE TWO RELIGIONS DRAWS EARNEST ATTENTION TO THE FACT
984-137154-0053 THAT AT CERTAIN RELIGIOUS FEASTS THE ROBE OF THE LAMA IS RENT IN PIECES OUT OF RESPECT AND THE REMNANTS HIGHLY VALUED BUT THIS IS THE REVERSE OF A RESEMBLANCE FOR THE GARMENTS OF CHRIST WERE NOT RENT IN PIECES OUT OF RESPECT BUT OUT OF DERISION
984-137154-0054 AND THE REMNANTS WERE NOT HIGHLY VALUED EXCEPT FOR WHAT THEY WOULD FETCH IN THE RAG SHOPS IT IS RATHER LIKE ALLUDING TO THE OBVIOUS CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO CEREMONIES OF THE SWORD WHEN IT TAPS A MAN'S SHOULDER AND WHEN IT CUTS OFF HIS HEAD
984-137154-0055 IF IT WERE NOT ALSO TRUE THAT THE ALLEGED PHILOSOPHICAL RESEMBLANCES ARE ALSO OF THESE TWO KINDS EITHER PROVING TOO MUCH OR NOT PROVING ANYTHING THAT BUDDHISM APPROVES OF MERCY OR OF SELF RESTRAINT
984-137154-0056 BUDDHISTS DISAPPROVE IN THEORY OF CRUELTY OR EXCESS BECAUSE ALL SANE HUMAN BEINGS DISAPPROVE IN THEORY OF CRUELTY OR EXCESS BUT TO SAY THAT BUDDHISM AND CHRISTIANITY GIVE THE SAME PHILOSOPHY OF THESE THINGS IS SIMPLY FALSE
984-137154-0057 ALL HUMANITY DOES AGREE THAT WE ARE IN A NET OF SIN MOST OF HUMANITY AGREES THAT THERE IS SOME WAY OUT BUT AS TO WHAT IS THE WAY OUT I DO NOT THINK THAT THERE ARE TWO INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNIVERSE WHICH CONTRADICT EACH OTHER SO FLATLY AS BUDDHISM AND CHRISTIANITY
984-137154-0058 EVEN WHEN I THOUGHT WITH MOST OTHER WELL INFORMED THOUGH UNSCHOLARLY PEOPLE THAT BUDDHISM AND CHRISTIANITY WERE ALIKE THERE WAS ONE THING ABOUT THEM THAT ALWAYS PERPLEXED ME
984-137154-0059 I DO NOT MEAN IN ITS TECHNICAL STYLE OF REPRESENTATION BUT IN THE THINGS THAT IT WAS MANIFESTLY MEANT TO REPRESENT NO TWO IDEALS COULD BE MORE OPPOSITE THAN A CHRISTIAN SAINT IN A GOTHIC CATHEDRAL AND A BUDDHIST SAINT IN A CHINESE TEMPLE
984-137154-0060 THE OPPOSITION EXISTS AT EVERY POINT BUT PERHAPS THE SHORTEST STATEMENT OF IT IS THAT THE BUDDHIST SAINT ALWAYS HAS HIS EYES SHUT
984-137154-0061 THE BUDDHIST SAINT HAS A SLEEK AND HARMONIOUS BODY BUT HIS EYES ARE HEAVY AND SEALED WITH SLEEP THE MEDIAEVAL SAINT'S BODY IS WASTED TO ITS CRAZY BONES BUT HIS EYES ARE FRIGHTFULLY ALIVE
984-137154-0062 THERE CANNOT BE ANY REAL COMMUNITY OF SPIRIT BETWEEN FORCES THAT PRODUCED SYMBOLS SO DIFFERENT AS THAT GRANTED THAT BOTH IMAGES ARE EXTRAVAGANCES ARE PERVERSIONS OF THE PURE CREED IT MUST BE A REAL DIVERGENCE WHICH COULD PRODUCE SUCH OPPOSITE EXTRAVAGANCES
