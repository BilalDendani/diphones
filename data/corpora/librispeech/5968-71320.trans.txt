5968-71320-0000 TOOK HIS DEPARTURE FROM GRAY FOREST LEAVING POOR RHODA TO THE GUARDIANSHIP OF HER GUILTY STEPMOTHER AND ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SEEN SO LITTLE OF HER FATHER YET THE VERY CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS PRESENCE HAD GIVEN HER A CERTAIN CONFIDENCE AND SENSE OF SECURITY WHICH VANISHED AT THE MOMENT OF HIS DEPARTURE
5968-71320-0001 FEAR STRICKEN AND WRETCHED AS HE HAD BEEN HIS REMOVAL NEVERTHELESS SEEMED TO HER TO RENDER THE LONELY AND INAUSPICIOUS MANSION STILL MORE DESOLATE AND OMINOUS THAN BEFORE SHE HAD WITH A VAGUE AND INSTINCTIVE ANTIPATHY
5968-71320-0002 AVOIDED ALL CONTACT AND INTERCOURSE WITH MISSUS MARSTON OR AS FOR DISTINCTNESS SAKE WE SHALL CONTINUE TO CALL HER MADEMOISELLE SINCE HER RETURN
5968-71320-0003 WE MUST NOW FOLLOW MISTER MARSTON IN HIS SOLITARY EXPEDITION TO CHESTER WHEN HE TOOK HIS PLACE IN THE STAGECOACH HE HAD THE WHOLE INTERIOR OF THE VEHICLE TO HIMSELF AND THUS CONTINUED TO BE ITS SOLITARY OCCUPANT FOR SEVERAL MILES THE COACH HOWEVER WAS EVENTUALLY HAILED
5968-71320-0004 BROUGHT TO AND THE DOOR BEING OPENED DOCTOR DANVERS GOT IN AND TOOK HIS PLACE OPPOSITE TO THE PASSENGER ALREADY ESTABLISHED THERE THE WORTHY MAN WAS SO BUSIED IN DIRECTING THE DISPOSITION OF HIS LUGGAGE FROM THE WINDOW AND IN ARRANGING THE SUNDRY SMALL PARCELS WITH WHICH HE WAS CHARGED
5968-71320-0005 THAT HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIS COMPANION UNTIL THEY WERE IN MOTION WHEN HE DID SO IT WAS WITH NO VERY PLEASURABLE FEELING AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT MARSTON TOO WOULD HAVE GLADLY ESCAPED THE COINCIDENCE WHICH THUS REDUCED THEM ONCE MORE TO THE TEMPORARY NECESSITY OF A TATE A TATE
5968-71320-0006 EMBARRASSING AS EACH FELT THE SITUATION TO BE THERE WAS HOWEVER NO AVOIDING IT AND AFTER A RECOGNITION AND A FEW FORCED ATTEMPTS AT CONVERSATION THEY BECAME BY MUTUAL CONSENT SILENT AND UNCOMMUNICATIVE THE JOURNEY THOUGH IN POINT OF SPACE A MERE TRIFLE
5968-71320-0007 DOCTOR DANVERS I HAVE BEEN FIFTY TIMES ON THE POINT OF SPEAKING TO YOU CONFIDENTIALLY OF COURSE WHILE SITTING HERE OPPOSITE TO YOU WHAT I BELIEVE I COULD SCARCELY BRING MYSELF TO HINT TO ANY OTHER MAN LIVING YET I MUST TELL IT AND SOON TOO OR I FEAR IT WILL HAVE TOLD ITSELF
5968-71320-0008 DOCTOR DANVERS INTIMATED HIS READINESS TO HEAR AND ADVISE IF DESIRED AND MARSTON RESUMED ABRUPTLY AFTER A PAUSE PRAY DOCTOR DANVERS HAVE YOU HEARD ANY STORIES OF AN ODD KIND ANY SURMISES
5968-71320-0009 I DON'T MEAN OF A MORAL SORT FOR THOSE I HOLD VERY CHEAP TO MY PREJUDICE INDEED I SHOULD HARDLY SAY TO MY PREJUDICE I MEAN I OUGHT TO SAY IN SHORT HAVE YOU HEARD PEOPLE REMARK UPON ANY FANCIED ECCENTRICITIES OR THAT SORT OF THING ABOUT ME
5968-71320-0010 HE PUT THE QUESTION WITH OBVIOUS DIFFICULTY AND AT LAST SEEMED TO OVERCOME HIS OWN RELUCTANCE WITH A SORT OF ANGRY AND EXCITED SELF CONTEMPT AND IMPATIENCE DOCTOR DANVERS WAS A LITTLE PUZZLED BY THE INTERROGATORY AND ADMITTED IN REPLY
5968-71320-0011 BUT OF THE IMMORTAL TENANT OF THIS BODY MY MIND SIR IS BEGINNING TO PLAY ME TRICKS MY GUIDE MOCKS AND TERRIFIES ME THERE WAS A PERCEPTIBLE TINGE OF HORROR IN THE LOOK OF ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH DOCTOR DANVERS LISTENED YOU ARE A GENTLEMAN SIR
5968-71320-0012 AND A CHRISTIAN CLERGYMAN WHAT I HAVE SAID AND SHALL SAY IS CONFIDED TO YOUR HONOR TO BE HELD SACRED AS THE CONFESSION OF MISERY AND HIDDEN FROM THE COARSE GAZE OF THE WORLD I HAVE BECOME SUBJECT TO A HIDEOUS DELUSION IT COMES AT INTERVALS I DO NOT THINK ANY MORTAL SUSPECTS IT
5968-71320-0013 MARSTON PAUSED HE WAS STOOPED FORWARD AND LOOKING UPON THE FLOOR OF THE VEHICLE SO THAT HIS COMPANION COULD NOT SEE HIS COUNTENANCE A SILENCE ENSUED WHICH WAS INTERRUPTED BY MARSTON WHO ONCE MORE RESUMED SIR SAID HE
5968-71320-0014 I KNOW NOT WHY BUT I HAVE LONGED INTENSELY LONGED FOR SOME TRUSTWORTHY EAR INTO WHICH TO POUR THIS HORRID SECRET WHY I REPEAT I CANNOT TELL FOR I EXPECT NO SYMPATHY AND HATE COMPASSION IT IS I SUPPOSE THE RESTLESS NATURE OF THE DEVIL THAT IS IN ME BUT BE IT WHAT IT MAY
5968-71320-0015 FOR THE PRESENT AT LEAST TO YOU ALONE DOCTOR DANVERS AGAIN ASSURED HIM THAT HE MIGHT REPOSE THE MOST ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN HIS SECRECY THE HUMAN MIND I TAKE IT MUST HAVE EITHER COMFORT IN THE PAST OR HOPE IN THE FUTURE HE CONTINUED OTHERWISE IT IS IN DANGER
5968-71320-0016 TO ME SIR THE PAST IS INTOLERABLY REPULSIVE ONE BOUNDLESS BARREN AND HIDEOUS GOLGOTHA OF DEAD HOPES AND MURDERED OPPORTUNITIES THE FUTURE STILL BLACKER AND MORE FURIOUS PEOPLED WITH DREADFUL FEATURES OF HORROR AND MENACE
5968-71320-0017 AND LOSING ITSELF IN UTTER DARKNESS SIR I DO NOT EXAGGERATE BETWEEN SUCH A PAST AND SUCH A FUTURE I STAND UPON THIS MISERABLE PRESENT
5968-71320-0018 NO SIR THERE IS NO COMFORT FROM THAT QUARTER EITHER SAID MARSTON BITTERLY YOU BUT CAST YOUR SEEDS AS THE PARABLE TERMS YOUR TEACHING UPON THE BARREN SEA IN WASTING THEM ON ME MY FATE BE IT WHAT IT MAY IS AS IRREVOCABLY FIXED AS THOUGH I WERE DEAD AND JUDGED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
5968-71320-0019 THAT OCCURRENCE ABOUT WYNSTON BERKLEY HE IS THE HERO OF THE HELLISH ILLUSION AT CERTAIN TIMES SIR IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF HE THOUGH DEAD WERE STILL INVESTED WITH A SORT OF SPURIOUS LIFE GOING ABOUT UNRECOGNIZED EXCEPT BY ME IN SQUALOR AND CONTEMPT
5968-71320-0020 AND WHISPERING AWAY MY FAME AND LIFE LABORING WITH THE MALIGNANT INDUSTRY OF A FIEND TO INVOLVE ME IN THE MESHES OF THAT SPECIAL PERDITION FROM WHICH ALONE I SHRINK
5968-71320-0021 SIR THIS IS A MONSTROUS AND HIDEOUS EXTRAVAGANCE A DELUSION BUT AFTER ALL NO MORE THAN A TRICK OF THE IMAGINATION THE REASON THE JUDGMENT IS UNTOUCHED I CANNOT CHOOSE BUT SEE ALL THE DAMNED PHANTASMAGORIA BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT REAL
5968-71320-0022 AND THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY CASE AND AND MADNESS THEY WERE NOW ENTERING THE SUBURBS OF CHESTER AND DOCTOR DANVERS PAINED AND SHOCKED BEYOND MEASURE BY THIS UNLOOKED FOR DISCLOSURE AND NOT KNOWING WHAT REMARK OR COMFORT TO OFFER
5968-71320-0023 BUT THE FACT IS THIS BEGINNING LIKE A SPECK THIS ONE IDEA HAS GRADUALLY DARKENED AND DILATED UNTIL IT HAS FILLED MY ENTIRE MIND THE SOLITARY CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE GIGANTIC MASTERY IT HAS ESTABLISHED THERE HAD GROWN INTOLERABLE I MUST HAVE TOLD IT
5968-71320-0024 THE SENSE OF SOLITUDE UNDER THIS AGGRESSIVE AND TREMENDOUS DELUSION WAS AGONY HOURLY DEATH TO MY SOUL THAT IS THE SECRET OF MY TALKATIVENESS MY SOLE EXCUSE FOR PLAGUING YOU WITH THE DREAMS OF A WRETCHED HYPOCHONDRIAC
5968-71320-0025 THEY BID ONE ANOTHER FAREWELL AND PARTED AT THAT TIME THERE RESIDED IN A DECENT MANSION ABOUT A MILE FROM THE TOWN OF CHESTER A DAPPER LITTLE GENTLEMAN WHOM WE SHALL CALL DOCTOR PARKES THIS GENTLEMAN WAS THE PROPRIETOR AND SOLE PROFESSIONAL MANAGER
