2775-161226-0000 ION WAS THE SON OF CREUSA THE BEAUTEOUS DAUGHTER OF ERECHTHEUS KING OF ATHENS AND THE SUN GOD PHOEBUS APOLLO TO WHOM SHE WAS UNITED WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF HER FATHER
2775-161226-0001 AND HANGING SOME GOLDEN CHARMS ROUND HIS NECK INVOKED FOR HIM THE PROTECTION OF THE GODS AND CONCEALED HIM IN A LONELY CAVE APOLLO PITYING HIS DESERTED CHILD
2775-161226-0002 WHERE HE DEPOSITED HIS CHARGE ON THE STEPS OF THE TEMPLE NEXT MORNING THE DELPHIC PRIESTESS DISCOVERED THE INFANT AND WAS SO CHARMED BY HIS ENGAGING APPEARANCE THAT SHE ADOPTED HIM AS HER OWN SON
2775-161226-0003 THE YOUNG CHILD WAS CAREFULLY TENDED AND REARED BY HIS KIND FOSTER MOTHER AND WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE SERVICE OF THE TEMPLE WHERE HE WAS INTRUSTED WITH SOME OF THE MINOR DUTIES OF THE HOLY EDIFICE AND NOW TO RETURN TO CREUSA
2775-161226-0004 XUTHUS SON OF A EOLUS GREATLY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF ON THE SIDE OF THE ATHENIANS AND AS A REWARD FOR HIS VALUABLE SERVICES THE HAND OF CREUSA THE KING'S DAUGHTER WAS BESTOWED UPON HIM IN MARRIAGE THEIR UNION HOWEVER WAS NOT BLEST WITH CHILDREN
2775-161226-0005 AND AS THIS WAS A SOURCE OF GREAT GRIEF TO BOTH OF THEM
2775-161226-0006 THE RESPONSE WAS THAT XUTHUS SHOULD REGARD THE FIRST PERSON WHO MET HIM ON LEAVING THE SANCTUARY AS HIS SON NOW IT HAPPENED THAT ION THE YOUNG GUARDIAN OF THE TEMPLE WAS THE FIRST TO GREET HIS VIEW
2775-161226-0007 AND WHEN XUTHUS BEHELD THE BEAUTIFUL YOUTH HE GLADLY WELCOMED HIM AS HIS SON DECLARING THAT THE GODS HAD SENT HIM TO BE A BLESSING AND COMFORT TO HIS OLD AGE CREUSA HOWEVER WHO CONCLUDED THAT THE YOUTH WAS THE OFFSPRING OF A SECRET MARRIAGE ON THE PART OF HER HUSBAND
2775-161226-0008 BEGGED HER TO BE COMFORTED ASSURING HER THAT THE CAUSE OF HER DISTRESS SHOULD BE SPEEDILY REMOVED WHEN UPON THE OCCASION OF THE PUBLIC ADOPTION OF HIS SON XUTHUS GAVE A GRAND BANQUET
2775-161226-0009 THE OLD SERVANT OF CREUSA CONTRIVED TO MIX A STRONG POISON IN THE WINE OF THE UNSUSPECTING ION BUT THE YOUTH ACCORDING TO THE PIOUS CUSTOM OF THE ANCIENTS OF OFFERING A LIBATION TO THE GODS BEFORE PARTAKING OF ANY REPAST
2775-161226-0010 POURED UPON THE GROUND A PORTION OF THE WINE BEFORE PUTTING IT TO HIS LIPS WHEN SUDDENLY AS IF BY A MIRACLE A DOVE FLEW INTO THE BANQUET HALL AND SIPPED OF THE WINE OF THE LIBATION WHEREUPON THE POOR LITTLE CREATURE BEGAN TO QUIVER IN EVERY LIMB
2775-161226-0011 AND IN A FEW MOMENTS EXPIRED ION'S SUSPICIONS AT ONCE FELL UPON THE OBSEQUIOUS SERVANT OF CREUSA WHO WITH SUCH OFFICIOUS ATTENTION HAD FILLED HIS CUP HE VIOLENTLY SEIZED THE OLD MAN AND ACCUSED HIM OF HIS MURDEROUS INTENTIONS
2775-161226-0012 UNPREPARED FOR THIS SUDDEN ATTACK HE ADMITTED HIS GUILT BUT POINTED TO THE WIFE OF XUTHUS AS THE INSTIGATOR OF THE CRIME ION WAS ABOUT TO AVENGE HIMSELF UPON CREUSA WHEN BY MEANS OF THE DIVINE INTERVENTION OF APOLLO HIS FOSTER MOTHER
2775-161226-0013 THE DELPHIC PRIESTESS APPEARED ON THE SCENE AND EXPLAINED THE TRUE RELATIONSHIP WHICH EXISTED BETWEEN CREUSA AND ION IN ORDER TO SET ALL DOUBTS AT REST SHE PRODUCED THE CHARMS WHICH SHE HAD FOUND ROUND THE NECK OF THE INFANT
2775-161226-0014 MOTHER AND SON NOW BECAME RECONCILED TO EACH OTHER AND CREUSA REVEALED TO ION THE SECRET OF HIS DIVINE ORIGIN
2775-161226-0015 CALLED AFTER HIM THE IONIANS AND ALSO THAT XUTHUS AND CREUSA WOULD HAVE A SON CALLED DORUS WHO WOULD BE THE PROGENITOR OF THE DORIAN PEOPLE BOTH OF WHICH PREDICTIONS WERE IN DUE TIME VERIFIED DAEDALUS AND ICARUS
2775-161226-0016 HAVING THE LIMBS ALTOGETHER UNDEFINED BUT GREAT AS WAS HIS GENIUS STILL GREATER WAS HIS VANITY AND HE COULD BROOK NO RIVAL NOW HIS NEPHEW AND PUPIL TALUS EXHIBITED GREAT TALENT
2775-161226-0017 HAVING INVENTED BOTH THE SAW AND THE COMPASS AND DAEDALUS FEARING LEST HE MIGHT OVERSHADOW HIS OWN FAME SECRETLY KILLED HIM BY THROWING HIM DOWN FROM THE CITADEL OF PALLAS ATHENE THE MURDER BEING DISCOVERED
2775-161226-0018 DAEDALUS WAS SUMMONED BEFORE THE COURT OF THE AREOPAGUS AND CONDEMNED TO DEATH BUT HE MADE HIS ESCAPE TO THE ISLAND OF CRETE WHERE HE WAS RECEIVED BY KING MINOS IN A MANNER WORTHY OF HIS GREAT REPUTATION DAEDALUS CONSTRUCTED FOR THE KING THE WORLD RENOWNED LABYRINTH
2775-161226-0019 WHICH WAS AN IMMENSE BUILDING FULL OF INTRICATE PASSAGES INTERSECTING EACH OTHER IN SUCH A MANNER THAT EVEN DAEDALUS HIMSELF IS SAID UPON ONE OCCASION TO HAVE NEARLY LOST HIS WAY IN IT AND IT WAS IN THIS BUILDING THE KING PLACED THE MINOTAUR
2775-161226-0020 A MONSTER WITH THE HEAD AND SHOULDERS OF A BULL AND THE BODY OF A MAN IN THE COURSE OF TIME THE GREAT ARTIST BECAME WEARY OF HIS LONG EXILE MORE ESPECIALLY AS THE KING UNDER THE GUISE OF FRIENDSHIP KEPT HIM ALMOST A PRISONER
2775-161226-0021 HE THEREFORE RESOLVED TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE AND FOR THIS PURPOSE INGENIOUSLY CONTRIVED WINGS FOR HIMSELF AND HIS YOUNG SON ICARUS WHOM HE DILIGENTLY TRAINED HOW TO USE THEM HAVING AWAITED A FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY FATHER AND SON COMMENCED THEIR FLIGHT
2775-161226-0022 AND WERE WELL ON THEIR WAY WHEN ICARUS
2775-161226-0023 FORGOT ALTOGETHER HIS FATHER'S OFT REPEATED INJUNCTION NOT TO APPROACH TOO NEAR THE SUN THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THE WAX BY MEANS OF WHICH HIS WINGS WERE ATTACHED MELTED AND HE FELL INTO THE SEA AND WAS DROWNED
2775-161226-0024 THE BODY OF THE UNFORTUNATE ICARUS WAS WASHED UP BY THE TIDE AND WAS BURIED BY THE BEREAVED FATHER ON AN ISLAND WHICH HE CALLED AFTER HIS SON
2775-161226-0025 AFTER THIS SAD EVENT DAEDALUS WINGED HIS FLIGHT TO THE ISLAND OF SICILY
2775-161226-0026 FOR WHOM HE CONSTRUCTED SEVERAL IMPORTANT PUBLIC WORKS BUT NO SOONER DID MINOS RECEIVE THE INTELLIGENCE THAT HIS GREAT ARCHITECT HAD FOUND AN ASYLUM WITH COCALUS THAN HE SAILED OVER TO SICILY WITH A LARGE ARMY AND SENT MESSENGERS TO THE SICILIAN KING DEMANDING THE SURRENDER OF HIS GUEST
2775-161226-0027 COCALUS FEIGNED COMPLIANCE AND INVITED MINOS TO HIS PALACE WHERE HE WAS TREACHEROUSLY PUT TO DEATH IN A WARM BATH THE BODY OF THEIR KING WAS BROUGHT TO AGRIGENT BY THE CRETANS WHERE IT WAS BURIED WITH GREAT POMP AND OVER HIS TOMB A TEMPLE TO APHRODITE WAS ERECTED
