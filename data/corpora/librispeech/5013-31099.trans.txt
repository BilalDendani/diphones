5013-31099-0000 THE HOUSE OF TRUTH ONE MORNING I LAY UPON MY BED IN THE LITTLE ROOM WHICH I CALL MY HOME NOW AMONG THE EAVES WHICH RISE OPPOSITE TO MY WINDOW THERE ARE MANY SPARROWS
5013-31099-0001 WHICH HAVE ALSO MADE THEIR HOMES IN THE MORNING BEFORE THE SUN HAS ARISEN
5013-31099-0002 INSTEAD OF SOMBER AND BLACK THESE SPARROWS BEGIN TO CHATTER AND CHIRP AND SING IN DISCORDANT NOTES AND BY THIS I KNOW THE DAY HAS COME
5013-31099-0003 UPON THIS MORNING IT SEEMED TO ME THE SPARROWS CHATTERED WITH AN UNUSUAL COMMOTION AND AS I LISTENED I HEARD FROM ANOTHER WINDOW NEAR MINE THE VOICE OF GRIEF AND LAMENTATION
5013-31099-0004 THEN I KNEW THAT ONE WHO HAD LONG BEEN SICK HAD PASSED AWAY AS THE GRAY MORNING CAME ON THIS SPIRIT THIS SPARK OF LIFE HAD GONE OUT FROM ITS ACCUSTOMED PLACE AS THE DAY CAME ON
5013-31099-0005 THE SOUNDS OF LAMENTATION AROSE THE FRIENDS OF THAT ONE WEPT SO I ASKED THE SPARROWS AND THE SUN AND THE GRAY SKY WHY THESE FRIENDS WEPT WHAT IS GRIEF
5013-31099-0006 WHY SHOULD THESE WEEP WHAT HAS HAPPENED WHEN ONE DIES WHERE HAS THE SPARK OF LIFE GONE DID IT FALL TO THESE SODDEN PAVEMENTS FOR EVER DONE
5013-31099-0007 TO MEET THE KISS OF THE RISING SUN AND THE SPARROWS WHICH FALL TO THE GROUND ANSWERED NOT THE SUN ROSE CALM AND PASSIONLESS BUT DUMB THE SKY FOLDED IN LARGE BUT INSCRUTABLE
5013-31099-0008 NONE THE LESS AROSE THE VOICE OF LAMENTATION AND OF WOE I ASK YOU SINGING MOUSE SAID I ONE NIGHT AS WE SAT ALONE WHAT IS THE TRUTH HOW DO WE REACH IT
5013-31099-0009 HOW SHALL WE KNOW IT TELL ME OF THIS SPARK THAT HAS GONE OUT TELL ME WHAT IS LIFE AND WHERE DOES IT GO THERE ARE MANY WORDS TELL ME WHAT IS THE TRUTH
5013-31099-0010 THE SINGING MOUSE GAZED AT ME IN ITS WAY OF PITY SO I KNEW I HAD ASKED THAT WHICH COULD NOT BE YET EVEN AS I SAW THIS LOOK APPEAR IT CHANGED AND VANISHED
5013-31099-0011 AND AS THE SINGING MOUSE WAVED ITS TINY PAW I FORBORE REFLECTION AND LOOKED ONLY ON THE SCENE WHICH NOW WAS SPREAD BEFORE ME IT SEEMED A PICTURE OF ACTUAL COLORS
5013-31099-0012 AND I COULD SEE IT PLAINLY I SAW A YOUTH WHO STOOD WITH ONE OLDER AND OF AUSTERE GARB BY THE VESTMENTS OF THIS OLDER MAN
5013-31099-0013 TO HIM THE YOUNG MAN HAD COME IN ANGUISH OF HEART THEN THE OLDER MAN OF PRIESTLY GARB TAUGHT THE YOUNG MAN IN THE TEACHINGS THAT HAD COME DOWN TO HIM BUT THE YOUTH BOWED HIS HEAD IN TROUBLE
5013-31099-0014 NOR WAS THE CLOUD CLEARED UPON HIS HEART I HEARD HIM MURMUR ALAS WHAT IS THE TRUTH SO I SAW THIS SAME YOUTH PASS ON IN VARIOUS STAGES OF THIS PICTURE
5013-31099-0015 AND BEFORE HIM I SAW DRAWN AS THOUGH IN ANOTHER PICTURE
5013-31099-0016 BUT THE YEARS PASSED AND THE PANORAMA OF BELIEFS SWEPT BY AND NO ONE COULD TELL THIS MAN
5013-31099-0017 AFTER THIS YOUNG MAN HAD CEASED TO QUERY AND HAD CLOSED HIS BOOKS HE ONE DAY ENTERED ALONE INTO ONE OF THE GREAT EDIFICES BUILT FOR THE SAKE OF THAT WHICH HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IN THE PICTURE I COULD SEE ALL THIS
5013-31099-0018 I SAW THE YOUNG MAN CAST HIMSELF FACE DOWN AMONG THE CUSHIONS OF A SEAT AND THERE HE LAY AND LISTENED TO THE MUSIC THIS TOO I COULD HEAR
5013-31099-0019 I COULD HEAR THE PEAL OF THE ORGAN ARISE LIKE VOICES OF THE SPIRITS GOING UP UP WHISPERING APPEALING PROMISING ASSURING THEN FOR I COULD SEE AND HEAR WITH HIM THERE CAME TO THAT YOUNG MAN
5013-31099-0020 WHEN HE CEASED TO SEEK THE VERY EXALTATION HE HAD LONGED TO KNOW AH YES SINGING MOUSE I SAID IT WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT MUSIC IS NOT FINAL MUSIC IS NOT THE TRUTH
5013-31099-0021 TELL ME OF THESE THINGS THE SINGING MOUSE AGAIN SEEMED TO HESITATE IT MAY BE SAID THE SINGING MOUSE SLOWLY THAT THE TRUTH WILL NEVER BE FOUND BETWEEN THE COVERS OF ANY BOOK NO MATTER HOW WISE
5013-31099-0022 IT MAY BE THAT NO MAN CAN CONVEY TO ANOTHER THAT WHICH IS THE TRUTH TO HIM IT MAY BE THAT THE TRUTH CAN NEVER BE GRASPED NEVER BE WEIGHED OR FORMULATED
5013-31099-0023 THE WAYS OF NATURE ARE ALWAYS THE SAME BUT NATURE DOES NOT ASK EXACTNESS OF FORM WHY THEN SHALL WE ASK EXACTNESS OF FAITH
5013-31099-0024 THE TRUE FAITH IS NOTHING FINAL NOT MORE THAN ARE FINAL THE CARVED STONES OF THE CHURCH WHICH OFFERS IT SO STRENUOUSLY THE STONES CRUMBLE AND DECAY
5013-31099-0025 NEW FAITHS WILL RISE BUT WERE NOT ALL WELL AT THESE THINGS I WONDERED AND OVER THEM I THOUGHT FOR A TIME BUT YET I DID NOT UNDERSTAND ALL THAT THE SINGING MOUSE HAD SAID
5013-31099-0026 AS IF IT KNEW MY THOUGHT THE SINGING MOUSE SAID TO ME YOUR VISION IS TOO NARROW YOU SEEK THE GREAT TRUTHS IN SMALL PLACES AND WONDER THAT YOU DO NOT FIND THEM COME WITH ME
5013-31099-0027 THE SINGING MOUSE WAVED ITS HAND
5013-31099-0028 AND AS IN A DREAM AND AS THOUGH I WERE NOW THE YOUNG MAN WHOM WE HAD LATELY SEEN
5013-31099-0029 I COULD HEAR VOICES THAT SANG UP AND UP THRILLING COMPELLING THE SENSE OF THE CONFINEMENT OF THE BUILDING CEASED INSENSIBLY I SEEMED TO SEE THE HEWN STONES OF THE WALLS
5013-31099-0030 ASSUME THEIR PRIMEVAL AND UNTOUCHED STATE BENEATH THE GRASSES OF THE HILLS I COULD FEEL THE RAFTERS VANISHING AND GOING BACK INTO THE BODIES OF THE OAKS
5013-31099-0031 THE VOICE OF THE ORGAN REMAINED WITH ME BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE ROLL OF THE WAVES UPON THE SHORE I WAS IN THE TEMPLE IN THE TEMPLE ONE NEEDS NOT SEEK FOR NAMES
5013-31099-0032 IT WAS NIGHT I LAY UPON A BANK OF SWEET SMELLING GRASSES AND ABOUT ME WERE THE GREAT OAKS THE ORGAN OR THE WAVES SPOKE ON I LOOKED UP UP
5013-31099-0033 INTO THE GREAT CIRCLE OF THE SKY SO FAR SO BLUE SO KIND IN ITS BENDING OVER SO PITYING IT SEEMED TO ME YET SO HIGH IN ITS UP REACHING
5013-31099-0034 I LOOKED UPON THE GLORIOUS PAGEANT OF THE STARS THAT STAR THOUGHT I SHONE OVER THE GRAVE OF SOME ANCESTOR OF MINE BACK BACK IN THE UNMIRRORED PAST SOME FATHER OF SOME FATHER OF MINE
5013-31099-0035 HE IS GONE LIKE A FLY HE IS DUST I MAY BE LYING ON HIS GRAVE SOON LIKE A FLY I TOO SHALL BE DEAD GONE TURNED INTO DUST
5013-31099-0036 BUT THE STAR WILL STILL SHINE ON SMALL AS THAT FATHER'S DUST MAY BE THAT DUST STILL LIVES IT IS ABOUT ME THIS GRASS THESE TREES MAY HOLD IT
5013-31099-0037 HE HAS LIVED AGAIN IN THE CYCLE OF NATURAL FORCES MY DUST WHEN I AM DEAD WILL IN TURN MAKE PART OF THIS WORLD ONE OF AN UNKNOWN SEA OF STARS
5013-31099-0038 SMALL THEN AS I AM I AM KIN TO THAT STAR THE STARS GO ON NATURE GOES ON THEN SHALL MAN SHALL I
5013-31099-0039 AH SAID THE SINGING MOUSE ITS VOICE SOUNDING I KNEW NOT WHENCE FROM THIS PLACE CAN YOU SEE SO NOW I THOUGHT I BEGAN TO SEE WHAT I HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE
5013-31099-0040 AND SINCE THIS WAS IN THE LAND OF THE SINGING MOUSE I SOUGHT TO FIND NO NAME FOR WHAT I SAW NOR TRIED TO MEASURE IT WHAT ONE MAN SEES IS NOT WHAT ANOTHER SEES
5013-31099-0041 SHALL ONE CLAIM WISDOM BEYOND HIS NEIGHBOR ARE NOT THE STARS HIS ALSO AND THE TREES HIS TO TALK WITH HIM ARE NOT THE DOORS ALWAYS OPEN
5013-31099-0042 DOES NOT THE MUSIC OF THE ORGAN EVER ROLL DO NOT THE VOICES ALWAYS RISE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SINGING MOUSE
