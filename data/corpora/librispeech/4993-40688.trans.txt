4993-40688-0000 I WAS INDEED IN PRUDENCE TAKING STEPS TOWARDS EVENTUALLY WITHDRAWING FROM SAINT MARY'S AND I WAS NOT CONFIDENT ABOUT MY PERMANENT ADHESION TO THE ANGLICAN CREED BUT I WAS IN NO ACTUAL PERPLEXITY OR TROUBLE OF MIND
4993-40688-0001 NOR DID THE IMMENSE COMMOTION CONSEQUENT UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THE TRACT UNSETTLE ME AGAIN FOR I FANCIED I HAD WEATHERED THE STORM AS FAR AS THE BISHOPS WERE CONCERNED THE TRACT HAD NOT BEEN CONDEMNED THAT WAS THE GREAT POINT
4993-40688-0002 AND I MADE MUCH OF IT TO ILLUSTRATE MY FEELINGS DURING THIS TRIAL I WILL MAKE EXTRACTS FROM MY LETTERS ADDRESSED SEVERALLY TO MISTER BOWDEN AND ANOTHER FRIEND WHICH HAVE COME INTO MY POSSESSION ONE
4993-40688-0003 YOU SEE NO DOCTRINE IS CENSURED
4993-40688-0004 IF YOU KNEW ALL OR WERE HERE YOU WOULD SEE THAT I HAVE ASSERTED A GREAT PRINCIPLE AND I OUGHT TO SUFFER FOR IT THAT THE ARTICLES ARE TO BE INTERPRETED NOT ACCORDING TO THE MEANING OF THE WRITERS BUT AS FAR AS THE WORDING WILL ADMIT
4993-40688-0005 ACCORDING TO THE SENSE OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH TWO
4993-40688-0006 AND HOPE MY FRIENDS WILL PRAY FOR ME TO THIS EFFECT IF AS YOU SAY A DESTINY HANGS OVER US A SINGLE FALSE STEP MAY RUIN ALL I AM VERY WELL AND COMFORTABLE BUT WE ARE NOT YET OUT OF THE WOOD
4993-40688-0007 THE BISHOP SENT ME WORD ON SUNDAY TO WRITE A LETTER TO HIM INSTANTER SO I WROTE IT ON MONDAY ON TUESDAY IT PASSED THROUGH THE PRESS ON WEDNESDAY IT WAS OUT AND TO DAY THURSDAY IT IS IN LONDON
4993-40688-0008 I TRUST THAT THINGS ARE SMOOTHING NOW AND THAT WE HAVE MADE A GREAT STEP IS CERTAIN IT IS NOT RIGHT TO BOAST TILL I AM CLEAR OUT OF THE WOOD
4993-40688-0009 YOU KNOW I SUPPOSE THAT I AM TO STOP THE TRACTS BUT YOU WILL SEE IN THE LETTER THOUGH I SPEAK QUITE WHAT I FEEL YET I HAVE MANAGED TO TAKE OUT ON MY SIDE MY SNUBBING'S WORTH AND THIS MAKES ME ANXIOUS HOW IT WILL BE RECEIVED IN LONDON
4993-40688-0010 I HAVE NOT HAD A MISGIVING FOR FIVE MINUTES FROM THE FIRST BUT I DO NOT LIKE TO BOAST
4993-40688-0011 YOUR LETTER OF THIS MORNING WAS AN EXCEEDINGLY GREAT GRATIFICATION TO ME AND IT IS CONFIRMED I AM THANKFUL TO SAY
4993-40688-0012 AND SINCE THAT HE HAS SENT ME A NOTE TO THE SAME EFFECT ONLY GOING MORE INTO DETAIL IT IS MOST PLEASANT TOO TO MY FEELINGS TO HAVE SUCH A TESTIMONY TO THE SUBSTANTIAL TRUTH AND IMPORTANCE
4993-40688-0013 FROM THOSE WHO FROM THEIR CAUTIOUS TURN OF MIND I WAS LEAST SANGUINE ABOUT I HAVE NOT HAD ONE MISGIVING MYSELF ABOUT IT THROUGHOUT
4993-40688-0014 THE BISHOPS ARE VERY DESIROUS OF HUSHING THE MATTER UP AND I CERTAINLY HAVE DONE MY UTMOST TO CO OPERATE WITH THEM ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE TRACT IS NOT TO BE WITHDRAWN OR CONDEMNED UPON THIS OCCASION SEVERAL CATHOLICS WROTE TO ME
4993-40688-0015 THE TRACTS ARE NOT SUPPRESSED NO DOCTRINE OR PRINCIPLE HAS BEEN CONCEDED BY US OR CONDEMNED BY AUTHORITY THE BISHOP HAS BUT SAID THAT A CERTAIN TRACT IS OBJECTIONABLE NO REASON BEING STATED
4993-40688-0016 I HAVE NO INTENTION WHATEVER OF YIELDING ANY ONE POINT WHICH I HOLD ON CONVICTION AND THAT THE AUTHORITIES OF THE CHURCH KNOW FULL WELL IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE I FOUND MYSELF AT LITTLEMORE
4993-40688-0017 WITHOUT ANY HARASS OR ANXIETY ON MY MIND I HAD DETERMINED TO PUT ASIDE ALL CONTROVERSY AND I SET MYSELF DOWN TO MY TRANSLATION OF SAINT ATHANASIUS BUT BETWEEN JULY AND NOVEMBER I RECEIVED THREE BLOWS WHICH BROKE ME
4993-40688-0018 ONE I HAD GOT BUT A LITTLE WAY IN MY WORK WHEN MY TROUBLE RETURNED ON ME THE GHOST HAD COME A SECOND TIME IN
4993-40688-0019 I WAS READING AND WRITING IN MY OWN LINE OF STUDY FAR FROM THE CONTROVERSIES OF THE DAY ON WHAT IS CALLED A METAPHYSICAL SUBJECT BUT I SAW CLEARLY THAT IN THE HISTORY OF ARIANISM THE PURE ARIANS WERE THE PROTESTANTS
4993-40688-0020 THE SEMI ARIANS WERE THE ANGLICANS AND THAT ROME NOW WAS WHAT IT WAS THEN THE TRUTH LAY NOT WITH THE VIA MEDIA BUT WITH WHAT WAS CALLED THE EXTREME PARTY
4993-40688-0021 AS I AM NOT WRITING A WORK OF CONTROVERSY I NEED NOT ENLARGE UPON THE ARGUMENT I HAVE SAID SOMETHING ON THE SUBJECT IN A VOLUME FROM WHICH I HAVE ALREADY QUOTED TWO I WAS IN THE MISERY OF THIS NEW UNSETTLEMENT
4993-40688-0022 THE BISHOPS ONE AFTER ANOTHER BEGAN TO CHARGE AGAINST ME IT WAS A FORMAL DETERMINATE MOVEMENT THIS WAS THE REAL UNDERSTANDING THAT ON WHICH I HAD ACTED ON THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF TRACT NINETY HAD COME TO NOUGHT
4993-40688-0023 WERE THAT PERHAPS TWO OR THREE OF THEM MIGHT THINK IT NECESSARY TO SAY SOMETHING IN THEIR CHARGES
4993-40688-0024 AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO ENFORCE THE UNDERSTANDING
4993-40688-0025 FOR THREE WHOLE YEARS I RECOGNIZED IT AS A CONDEMNATION IT WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS IN THEIR POWER AT FIRST I INTENDED TO PROTEST BUT I GAVE UP THE THOUGHT IN DESPAIR ON OCTOBER SEVENTEENTH I WROTE THUS TO A FRIEND
4993-40688-0026 I SUPPOSE IT WILL BE NECESSARY IN SOME SHAPE OR OTHER TO RE ASSERT TRACT NINETY ELSE IT WILL SEEM AFTER THESE BISHOPS CHARGES AS IF IT WERE SILENCED WHICH IT HAS NOT BEEN NOR DO I INTEND IT SHOULD BE
4993-40688-0027 I WISH TO KEEP QUIET BUT IF BISHOPS SPEAK I WILL SPEAK TOO IF THE VIEW WERE SILENCED I COULD NOT REMAIN IN THE CHURCH NOR COULD MANY OTHERS AND THEREFORE SINCE IT IS NOT SILENCED I SHALL TAKE CARE TO SHOW THAT IT ISN'T
4993-40688-0028 AS THEY CONTAIN SET THEMSELVES TO OPPOSE THEM WHATEVER BE THE INFLUENCE OF THE TRACTS GREAT OR SMALL THEY MAY BECOME JUST AS POWERFUL FOR ROME IF OUR CHURCH REFUSES THEM AS THEY WOULD BE FOR OUR CHURCH IF SHE ACCEPTED THEM
4993-40688-0029 IF OUR RULERS SPEAK EITHER AGAINST THE TRACTS OR NOT AT ALL IF ANY NUMBER OF THEM NOT ONLY DO NOT FAVOUR BUT EVEN DO NOT SUFFER THE PRINCIPLES CONTAINED IN THEM IT IS PLAIN THAT OUR MEMBERS MAY EASILY BE PERSUADED EITHER TO GIVE UP THOSE PRINCIPLES
4993-40688-0030 OR TO GIVE UP THE CHURCH IF THIS STATE OF THINGS GOES ON
4993-40688-0031 NOT ONE OR TWO BUT MANY SECESSIONS TO THE CHURCH OF ROME
4993-40688-0032 I SAID THERE WERE NO CONVERTS TO ROME
4993-40688-0033 THREE AS IF ALL THIS WERE NOT ENOUGH THERE CAME THE AFFAIR OF THE JERUSALEM BISHOPRIC AND WITH A BRIEF MENTION OF IT I SHALL CONCLUDE
4993-40688-0034 TO INTRODUCE EPISCOPACY
4993-40688-0035 WHICH WAS INTENDED IN THAT COUNTRY TO EMBRACE BOTH THE LUTHERAN AND CALVINISTIC BODIES I ALMOST THINK I HEARD OF THE PROJECT WHEN I WAS AT ROME IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE AT THE HOTEL OF THE PRUSSIAN MINISTER M BUNSEN
4993-40688-0036 WHO WAS MOST HOSPITABLE AND KIND AS TO OTHER ENGLISH VISITORS SO ALSO TO MY FRIENDS AND MYSELF THE IDEA OF EPISCOPACY AS THE PRUSSIAN KING UNDERSTOOD IT WAS I SUPPOSE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT TAUGHT
4993-40688-0037 IN THE TRACTARIAN SCHOOL BUT STILL I SUPPOSE ALSO THAT THE CHIEF AUTHORS OF THAT SCHOOL WOULD HAVE GLADLY SEEN SUCH A MEASURE CARRIED OUT IN PRUSSIA HAD IT BEEN DONE WITHOUT COMPROMISING THOSE PRINCIPLES WHICH WERE NECESSARY TO THE BEING OF A CHURCH
4993-40688-0038 ABOUT THE TIME OF THE PUBLICATION OF TRACT NINETY M BUNSEN AND THE THEN ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY WERE TAKING STEPS FOR ITS EXECUTION BY APPOINTING AND CONSECRATING A BISHOP FOR JERUSALEM
4993-40688-0039 JERUSALEM IT WOULD SEEM WAS CONSIDERED A SAFE PLACE FOR THE EXPERIMENT IT WAS TOO FAR FROM PRUSSIA TO AWAKEN THE SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF ANY PARTY AT HOME IF THE PROJECT FAILED
4993-40688-0040 TO ANY ONE AND IF IT SUCCEEDED IT GAVE PROTESTANTISM A STATUS IN THE EAST WHICH IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE MONOPHYSITE OR JACOBITE AND THE NESTORIAN BODIES FORMED A POLITICAL INSTRUMENT FOR ENGLAND
4993-40688-0041 PARALLEL TO THAT WHICH RUSSIA HAD IN THE GREEK CHURCH AND FRANCE IN THE LATIN
4993-40688-0042 I THUS SPOKE OF THE JERUSALEM SCHEME IN AN ARTICLE IN THE BRITISH CRITIC WHEN OUR THOUGHTS TURN TO THE EAST INSTEAD OF RECOLLECTING THAT THERE ARE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES THERE WE LEAVE IT TO THE RUSSIANS TO TAKE CARE OF THE GREEKS AND THE FRENCH TO TAKE CARE OF THE ROMANS
4993-40688-0043 AND WE CONTENT OURSELVES WITH ERECTING A PROTESTANT CHURCH AT JERUSALEM OR WITH HELPING THE JEWS TO REBUILD THEIR TEMPLE THERE
4993-40688-0044 TO BE BISHOPS IN ANY FOREIGN COUNTRY WHETHER SUCH FOREIGN SUBJECTS OR CITIZENS BE OR BE NOT SUBJECTS OR CITIZENS OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY ARE TO ACT AND WITHOUT REQUIRING SUCH OF THEM AS MAY BE SUBJECTS OR CITIZENS OF ANY FOREIGN KINGDOM OR STATE
4993-40688-0045 AND OVER SUCH OTHER PROTESTANT CONGREGATIONS AS MAY BE DESIROUS OF PLACING THEMSELVES UNDER HIS OR THEIR AUTHORITY NOW HERE AT THE VERY TIME THAT THE ANGLICAN BISHOPS WERE DIRECTING THEIR CENSURE UPON ME FOR AVOWING AN APPROACH
4993-40688-0046 AND THE SCHISMATICAL ORIENTAL BODIES BY MEANS OF THE INFLUENCE OF ENGLAND THIS WAS THE THIRD BLOW WHICH FINALLY SHATTERED MY FAITH IN THE ANGLICAN CHURCH THAT CHURCH WAS NOT ONLY FORBIDDING ANY SYMPATHY OR CONCURRENCE WITH THE CHURCH OF ROME
4993-40688-0047 BUT IT ACTUALLY WAS COURTING AN INTERCOMMUNION WITH PROTESTANT PRUSSIA AND THE HERESY OF THE ORIENTALS THE ANGLICAN CHURCH MIGHT HAVE THE APOSTOLICAL SUCCESSION AS HAD THE MONOPHYSITES BUT SUCH ACTS AS WERE IN PROGRESS
4993-40688-0048 NEXT THE EXCUSE IS THAT THERE ARE CONVERTED ANGLICAN JEWS THERE WHO REQUIRE A BISHOP
4993-40688-0049 BUT FOR THEM THE BISHOP IS SENT OUT AND FOR THEM HE IS A BISHOP OF THE CIRCUMCISION
4993-40688-0050 AGAINST THE EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS PRETTY NEARLY THIRDLY FOR THE SAKE OF PRUSSIA HE IS TO TAKE UNDER HIM ALL THE FOREIGN PROTESTANTS WHO WILL COME AND THE POLITICAL ADVANTAGES WILL BE SO GREAT FROM THE INFLUENCE OF ENGLAND
4993-40688-0051 THAT THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY WILL COME THEY ARE TO SIGN THE CONFESSION OF AUGSBURG
4993-40688-0052 OF BAPTISMAL REGENERATION AS TO MYSELF I SHALL DO NOTHING WHATEVER PUBLICLY UNLESS INDEED IT WERE TO GIVE MY SIGNATURE TO A PROTEST BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE OUT OF PLACE IN ME TO AGITATE
4993-40688-0053 HAVING BEEN IN A WAY SILENCED BUT THE ARCHBISHOP IS REALLY DOING MOST GRAVE WORK OF WHICH WE CANNOT SEE THE END I DID MAKE A SOLEMN PROTEST AND SENT IT TO THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY AND ALSO SENT IT TO MY OWN BISHOP
4993-40688-0054 WITH THE FOLLOWING LETTER IT SEEMS AS IF I WERE NEVER TO WRITE TO YOUR LORDSHIP WITHOUT GIVING YOU PAIN AND I KNOW THAT MY PRESENT SUBJECT DOES NOT SPECIALLY CONCERN YOUR LORDSHIP YET AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF ANXIOUS THOUGHT
4993-40688-0055 I LAY BEFORE YOU THE ENCLOSED PROTEST YOUR LORDSHIP WILL OBSERVE THAT I AM NOT ASKING FOR ANY NOTICE OF IT UNLESS YOU THINK THAT I OUGHT TO RECEIVE ONE I DO THIS VERY SERIOUS ACT IN OBEDIENCE TO MY SENSE OF DUTY
4993-40688-0056 IF THE ENGLISH CHURCH IS TO ENTER ON A NEW COURSE AND ASSUME A NEW ASPECT IT WILL BE MORE PLEASANT TO ME HEREAFTER TO THINK
4993-40688-0057 MAY I BE ALLOWED TO SAY THAT I AUGUR NOTHING BUT EVIL IF WE IN ANY RESPECT PREJUDICE OUR TITLE TO BE A BRANCH OF THE APOSTOLIC CHURCH THAT ARTICLE OF THE CREED I NEED HARDLY OBSERVE TO YOUR LORDSHIP IS OF SUCH CONSTRAINING POWER
4993-40688-0058 THAT OUR COMMUNION IS NOT A BRANCH OF THE ONE CHURCH I FORESEE WITH MUCH GRIEF WILL BE TEMPTED TO LOOK OUT FOR THAT CHURCH ELSEWHERE IT IS TO ME A SUBJECT OF GREAT DISMAY THAT AS FAR AS THE CHURCH HAS LATELY SPOKEN OUT ON THE SUBJECT OF THE OPINIONS
4993-40688-0059 WHICH I AND OTHERS HOLD THOSE OPINIONS ARE NOT MERELY NOT SANCTIONED FOR THAT I DO NOT ASK BUT NOT EVEN SUFFERED I EARNESTLY HOPE THAT YOUR LORDSHIP WILL EXCUSE MY FREEDOM IN THUS SPEAKING TO YOU OF SOME MEMBERS
4993-40688-0060 WITH EVERY FEELING OF REVERENT ATTACHMENT TO YOUR LORDSHIP I AM
4993-40688-0061 GOES FAR TOWARDS RECOGNIZING THE SAME AND WHEREAS LUTHERANISM AND CALVINISM ARE HERESIES REPUGNANT TO SCRIPTURE SPRINGING UP THREE CENTURIES SINCE AND ANATHEMATIZED BY EAST AS WELL AS WEST
4993-40688-0062 AND WHEREAS IT IS REPORTED THAT THE MOST REVEREND PRIMATE AND OTHER RIGHT REVEREND RULERS OF OUR CHURCH HAVE CONSECRATED A BISHOP
4993-40688-0063 FOR THE TIME BEING TO CONSECRATE TO THE OFFICE OF BISHOP PERSONS BEING SUBJECTS OR CITIZENS OF COUNTRIES OUT OF HIS MAJESTY'S DOMINIONS
4993-40688-0064 DISPENSING AT THE SAME TIME NOT IN PARTICULAR CASES AND ACCIDENTALLY BUT AS IF ON PRINCIPLE AND UNIVERSALLY
4993-40688-0065 ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER BY SO CLOSE AN INTERCOMMUNION THAT WHAT IS DONE BY AUTHORITY IN ONE IMMEDIATELY AFFECTS THE REST ON THESE GROUNDS I IN MY PLACE BEING A PRIEST OF THE ENGLISH CHURCH
4993-40688-0066 JOHN HENRY NEWMAN NOVEMBER ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE LOOKING BACK TWO YEARS AFTERWARDS ON THE ABOVE MENTIONED AND OTHER ACTS ON THE PART OF ANGLICAN ECCLESIASTICAL AUTHORITIES I OBSERVED
4993-40688-0067 MANY A MAN MIGHT HAVE HELD AN ABSTRACT THEORY ABOUT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH TO WHICH IT WAS DIFFICULT TO ADJUST THE ANGLICAN MIGHT HAVE ADMITTED A SUSPICION
4993-40688-0068 OR EVEN PAINFUL DOUBTS ABOUT THE LATTER YET NEVER HAVE BEEN IMPELLED ONWARDS HAD OUR RULERS PRESERVED THE QUIESCENCE OF FORMER YEARS BUT IT IS THE CORROBORATION OF A PRESENT LIVING AND ENERGETIC HETERODOXY
4993-40688-0069 THAT REALIZES AND MAKES SUCH DOUBTS PRACTICAL IT HAS BEEN THE RECENT SPEECHES AND ACTS OF AUTHORITIES WHO HAD SO LONG BEEN TOLERANT OF PROTESTANT ERROR WHICH HAS GIVEN TO INQUIRY AND TO THEORY ITS FORCE AND ITS EDGE
4993-40688-0070 AS TO THE PROJECT OF A JERUSALEM BISHOPRIC I NEVER HEARD OF ANY GOOD OR HARM IT HAS EVER DONE
