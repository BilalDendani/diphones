3889-130125-0000 IN WHICH FIX COMES FACE TO FACE WITH PHILEAS FOGG WHILE THESE EVENTS WERE PASSING AT THE OPIUM HOUSE MISTER FOGG UNCONSCIOUS OF THE DANGER HE WAS IN OF LOSING THE STEAMER WAS QUIETLY ESCORTING AOUDA ABOUT THE STREETS OF THE ENGLISH QUARTER
3889-130125-0001 MAKING THE NECESSARY PURCHASES FOR THE LONG VOYAGE BEFORE THEM IT WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR AN ENGLISHMAN LIKE MISTER FOGG TO MAKE THE TOUR OF THE WORLD WITH A CARPET BAG A LADY COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO TRAVEL COMFORTABLY UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS
3889-130125-0002 HE ACQUITTED HIS TASK WITH CHARACTERISTIC SERENITY AND INVARIABLY REPLIED TO THE REMONSTRANCES OF HIS FAIR COMPANION WHO WAS CONFUSED BY HIS PATIENCE AND GENEROSITY IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF MY JOURNEY A PART OF MY PROGRAMME
3889-130125-0003 HAD HE BEEN CAPABLE OF BEING ASTONISHED AT ANYTHING
3889-130125-0004 BUT KNOWING THAT THE STEAMER WAS NOT TO LEAVE FOR YOKOHAMA UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING HE DID NOT DISTURB HIMSELF ABOUT THE MATTER
3889-130125-0005 MISTER FOGG NOT BETRAYING THE LEAST VEXATION CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH TAKING HIS CARPET BAG CALLING AOUDA AND SENDING FOR A PALANQUIN IT WAS THEN EIGHT O'CLOCK AT HALF PAST NINE IT BEING THEN HIGH TIDE
3889-130125-0006 THE CARNATIC WOULD LEAVE THE HARBOUR MISTER FOGG AND AOUDA GOT INTO THE PALANQUIN THEIR LUGGAGE BEING BROUGHT AFTER ON A WHEELBARROW
3889-130125-0007 MISTER FOGG THEN LEARNED THAT THE CARNATIC HAD SAILED THE EVENING BEFORE HE HAD EXPECTED TO FIND NOT ONLY THE STEAMER BUT HIS DOMESTIC AND WAS FORCED TO GIVE UP BOTH BUT NO SIGN OF DISAPPOINTMENT APPEARED ON HIS FACE
3889-130125-0008 AND HE MERELY REMARKED TO AOUDA IT IS AN ACCIDENT MADAM NOTHING MORE AT THIS MOMENT A MAN WHO HAD BEEN OBSERVING HIM ATTENTIVELY APPROACHED IT WAS FIX WHO BOWING ADDRESSED MISTER FOGG

3889-130125-0011 SO DID I MADAM AND I AM EXCESSIVELY DISAPPOINTED THE CARNATIC ITS REPAIRS BEING COMPLETED LEFT HONG KONG TWELVE HOURS BEFORE THE STATED TIME
3889-130125-0012 WITHOUT ANY NOTICE BEING GIVEN AND WE MUST NOW WAIT A WEEK FOR ANOTHER STEAMER AS HE SAID A WEEK FIX FELT HIS HEART LEAP FOR JOY
3889-130125-0013 THERE WOULD BE TIME FOR THE WARRANT TO ARRIVE AND FORTUNE AT LAST FAVOURED THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LAW HIS HORROR MAY BE IMAGINED WHEN HE HEARD MISTER FOGG SAY IN HIS PLACID VOICE
3889-130125-0014 AND OFFERING HIS ARM TO AOUDA HE DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARD THE DOCKS IN SEARCH OF SOME CRAFT ABOUT TO START FIX STUPEFIED FOLLOWED IT SEEMED AS IF HE WERE ATTACHED TO MISTER FOGG BY AN INVISIBLE THREAD
3889-130125-0015 CHANCE HOWEVER APPEARED REALLY TO HAVE ABANDONED THE MAN IT HAD HITHERTO SERVED SO WELL FOR THREE HOURS PHILEAS FOGG WANDERED ABOUT THE DOCKS WITH THE DETERMINATION IF NECESSARY TO CHARTER A VESSEL TO CARRY HIM TO YOKOHAMA
3889-130125-0016 BUT HE COULD ONLY FIND VESSELS WHICH WERE LOADING OR UNLOADING AND WHICH COULD NOT THEREFORE SET SAIL FIX BEGAN TO HOPE AGAIN BUT MISTER FOGG FAR FROM BEING DISCOURAGED
3889-130125-0017 WAS CONTINUING HIS SEARCH RESOLVED NOT TO STOP IF HE HAD TO RESORT TO MACAO WHEN HE WAS ACCOSTED BY A SAILOR ON ONE OF THE WHARVES IS YOUR HONOUR LOOKING FOR A BOAT HAVE YOU A BOAT READY TO SAIL

3889-130125-0019 IS IT FOR A SEA EXCURSION NO FOR A VOYAGE A VOYAGE
3889-130125-0020 THE SAILOR LEANED ON THE RAILING OPENED HIS EYES WIDE AND SAID IS YOUR HONOUR JOKING
3889-130125-0021 I AM SORRY SAID THE SAILOR BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE I OFFER YOU A HUNDRED POUNDS PER DAY AND AN ADDITIONAL REWARD OF TWO HUNDRED POUNDS IF I REACH YOKOHAMA IN TIME
3889-130125-0022 ARE YOU IN EARNEST VERY MUCH SO THE PILOT WALKED AWAY A LITTLE DISTANCE AND GAZED OUT TO SEA
3889-130125-0023 EVIDENTLY STRUGGLING BETWEEN THE ANXIETY TO GAIN A LARGE SUM AND THE FEAR OF VENTURING SO FAR FIX WAS IN MORTAL SUSPENSE
3889-130125-0024 I COULD NOT RISK MYSELF MY MEN OR MY LITTLE BOAT OF SCARCELY TWENTY TONS ON SO LONG A VOYAGE AT THIS TIME OF YEAR BESIDES
3889-130125-0025 WE COULD NOT REACH YOKOHAMA IN TIME FOR IT IS SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILES FROM HONG KONG ONLY SIXTEEN HUNDRED SAID MISTER FOGG IT'S THE SAME THING
3889-130125-0026 BUT ADDED THE PILOT IT MIGHT BE ARRANGED ANOTHER WAY FIX CEASED TO BREATHE AT ALL HOW ASKED MISTER FOGG
3889-130125-0027 IN GOING TO SHANGHAI WE SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO SAIL WIDE OF THE CHINESE COAST WHICH WOULD BE A GREAT ADVANTAGE AS THE CURRENTS RUN NORTHWARD AND WOULD AID US PILOT SAID MISTER FOGG
3889-130125-0028 I MUST TAKE THE AMERICAN STEAMER AT YOKOHAMA AND NOT AT SHANGHAI OR NAGASAKI WHY NOT
3889-130125-0029 THE SAN FRANCISCO STEAMER DOES NOT START FROM YOKOHAMA IT PUTS IN AT YOKOHAMA AND NAGASAKI BUT IT STARTS FROM SHANGHAI YOU ARE SURE OF THAT PERFECTLY AND WHEN DOES THE BOAT LEAVE SHANGHAI
3889-130125-0030 ON THE ELEVENTH AT SEVEN IN THE EVENING WE HAVE THEREFORE FOUR DAYS BEFORE US THAT IS NINETY SIX HOURS AND IN THAT TIME IF WE HAD GOOD LUCK AND A SOUTH WEST WIND AND THE SEA WAS CALM
3889-130125-0031 WE COULD MAKE THOSE EIGHT HUNDRED MILES TO SHANGHAI

3889-130125-0036 I SHALL DO ALL I CAN TO FIND HIM REPLIED PHILEAS FOGG WHILE FIX IN A FEVERISH NERVOUS STATE REPAIRED TO THE PILOT BOAT THE OTHERS DIRECTED THEIR COURSE TO THE POLICE STATION AT HONG KONG
3889-130125-0037 THE SAME FORMALITIES HAVING BEEN GONE THROUGH AT THE FRENCH CONSULATE
3889-130125-0038 WHICH HAD BEEN SENT BACK THERE THEY RETURNED TO THE WHARF
3889-130125-0039 AND ITS PROVISIONS STORED AWAY WAS READY FOR DEPARTURE
3889-130125-0040 AS GRACEFULLY BUILT AS IF SHE WERE A RACING YACHT HER SHINING COPPER SHEATHING HER GALVANISED IRON WORK HER DECK WHITE AS IVORY BETRAYED THE PRIDE TAKEN BY JOHN BUNSBY IN MAKING HER PRESENTABLE
3889-130125-0041 HER TWO MASTS LEANED A TRIFLE BACKWARD SHE CARRIED BRIGANTINE FORESAIL STORM JIB AND STANDING JIB AND WAS WELL RIGGED FOR RUNNING BEFORE THE WIND AND SHE SEEMED CAPABLE OF BRISK SPEED WHICH INDEED
3889-130125-0042 SHE HAD ALREADY PROVED BY GAINING SEVERAL PRIZES IN PILOT BOAT RACES THE CREW OF THE TANKADERE WAS COMPOSED OF JOHN BUNSBY THE MASTER AND FOUR HARDY MARINERS WHO WERE FAMILIAR WITH THE CHINESE SEAS JOHN BUNSBY HIMSELF
3889-130125-0043 A MAN OF FORTY FIVE OR THEREABOUTS VIGOROUS SUNBURNT WITH A SPRIGHTLY EXPRESSION OF THE EYE AND ENERGETIC AND SELF RELIANT COUNTENANCE WOULD HAVE INSPIRED CONFIDENCE IN THE MOST TIMID
3889-130125-0044 PHILEAS FOGG AND AOUDA WENT ON BOARD WHERE THEY FOUND FIX ALREADY INSTALLED BELOW DECK WAS A SQUARE CABIN OF WHICH THE WALLS BULGED OUT IN THE FORM OF COTS ABOVE A CIRCULAR DIVAN IN THE CENTRE WAS A TABLE PROVIDED WITH A SWINGING LAMP
3889-130125-0045 MISTER FOGG AND AOUDA WHO WERE SEATED ON DECK
3889-130125-0046 LEST CHANCE SHOULD DIRECT THE STEPS OF THE UNFORTUNATE SERVANT WHOM HE HAD SO BADLY TREATED IN THIS DIRECTION IN WHICH CASE AN EXPLANATION THE REVERSE OF SATISFACTORY TO THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE ENSUED
3889-130125-0047 BUT THE FRENCHMAN DID NOT APPEAR AND WITHOUT DOUBT WAS STILL LYING UNDER THE STUPEFYING INFLUENCE OF THE OPIUM
