6535-114962-0000 THE OLD COAT OF DREAMS A PROLOGUE PEOPLE IN LONDON NOT MERELY LITERARY FOLK BUT EVEN THOSE HIGHER SOCIAL CIRCLES TO WHICH A CERTAIN PUBLISHER WHOSE NAME
6535-114962-0001 OR RACE IT IS HARDLY FAIR TO MENTION HAD SO OBSEQUIOUSLY CLIMBED OFTEN WONDERED WHENCE HAD COME THE WEALTH THAT ENABLED HIM TO MAINTAIN SUCH AN ESTABLISHMENT GIVE SUCH ELABORATE PARTIES
6535-114962-0002 HAVE SO MANY AUTOMOBILES AND GENERALLY MAKE ALL THAT DISPLAY WHICH IS SO CONVINCING TO THE MODERN MIND OF COURSE THEY WERE NOT SERIOUSLY CONCERNED BECAUSE SO LONG AS IT IS A PARTY
6535-114962-0003 AND THE CHEF IS PAID SO MUCH AND THE WINES ARE AS OLD AS THEY SHOULD BE NOT EVEN THE RAREST BLOSSOM ON THE MOST ANCIENT AND DISTINGUISHED GENEALOGICAL TREE CARES WHOSE PARTY IT IS
6535-114962-0004 OR INDEED WITH WHOM SHE DANCES THERE IS ONLY ONE DEMOCRACY AND THAT IS CONTROLLED BY GENTLEMEN WITH NAMES THAT HARDLY SOUND BEAUTIFUL ENOUGH TO MENTION IN FAIRY TALES
6535-114962-0005 THAT DEMOCRACY OF MONEY TO WHICH THE FAIREST FLOWER OF OUR ARISTOCRACY NOW BOWS HER CORONETED HEAD STRANGE
6535-114962-0006 THEREFORE ALL SORTS OF DISTINGUISHED AND BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE CAME TO THE PUBLISHER'S PARTIES IT WOULD HAVE MADE NO DIFFERENCE REALLY TO THEIR HARD HEARTS
6535-114962-0007 COULD THEY HAVE KNOWN WHERE ALL THE CHAMPAGNE AND CONSERVATORIES AND MUSIC CAME FROM THEY WOULD HAVE GONE ON DANCING ALL THE SAME
6535-114962-0008 YET IT MAY INTEREST A SAD HEART HERE AND THERE TO KNOW HOW IT WAS THAT THAT PUBLISHER WHOSE NAME I FORGET BUT WHOSE NOSE I CAN NEVER FORGET WAS ABLE TO PAY FOR ALL THAT MUSIC AND DANCING
6535-114962-0009 STRANGE FLOWERS AND ENCHANTED FOOD NONE OF WHICH HE OF COURSE UNDERSTOOD ARISTOCRATS IN LONDON OF COURSE KNOW NOTHING OF A NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK CITY CALLED HARLEM
6535-114962-0010 WITH SO MANY STREETS THAT A LEARNED ARITHMETICIAN WOULD BE NEEDED TO NUMBER THEM A DISTRICT WHICH AT THE FIRST CALL OF SPRING BECOMES VOCAL WITH CHILDREN ON DOOR STEPS AND VENDERS OF EVERY VEGETABLE IN EVERY LANGUAGE
6535-114962-0011 IN THIS DISTRICT TOO YOU HEAR STRANGE TRUMPETS BLOW ANNOUNCING KNIFE AND SCISSORS GRINDERS AND STRANGE BELLS RINGING FROM STRINGS SUSPENDED ACROSS CARTS WHOSE MERCHANDISE
6535-114962-0012 IS BOTTLES AND OLD NEWSPAPERS YOU WILL HEAR TOO JUST WHEN THE INDOMITABLE SWEET SMELLS FROM THE TERRIBLE ETERNAL SPRING ARE BLOWING IN AT YOUR WINDOW
6535-114962-0013 AND THE MURMUR OF RICH HAPPY PEOPLE GOING AWAY IS HEARD IN THE LAND A RAUCOUS CRY IN THE HOT STREET A CRY FULL OF MELANCHOLY EVEN DESPAIR IT GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS
6535-114962-0014 WELL IT WAS JUST THEN THAT A YOUNG POET LIVING IN ONE OF THOSE HIGHLY ARITHMETICAL STREETS WAS WONDERING AS ALL THE SAD SPRING MURMUR CAME TO HIS EARS
6535-114962-0015 HOW HE COULD POSSIBLY BUY A ROSE FOR THE BOSOM OF HIS SWEETHEART WITH WHOM HE WAS TO DANCE THAT NIGHT AT A LOCAL BALL EVERYTHING HE HAD IN THE WORLD HAD GONE HE HAD SOLD EVERYTHING
6535-114962-0016 EXCEPT HIS POEMS ALL HIS PRECIOUS BOOKS HAD GONE SAD ONE BY ONE LITTLE PAINTINGS THAT ONCE MADE HIS WALLS SEEM LIKE THE LOUVRE HAD GONE
6535-114962-0017 ALL HIS OLD SILVER SPOONS AND ALL THE LITTLE INTAGLIOS HE LOVED SO WELL AND YES HE HAD EVEN SOLD THE OLD COPPER CHEST OF THE RENAISSANCE ALL STUDDED NAILS
6535-114962-0018 WITH THREE LOCKS IN WHICH WELL ALL HAD GONE ONLY WHERE WAS THAT ROSE FOR THE BOSOM OF HIS SWEETHEART WHERE WAS IT GROWING WHERE AND HOW WAS IT TO BE BOUGHT
6535-114962-0019 JUST AS HE WAS AT HIS WIT'S END HE HEARD A CRY THROUGH THE WINDOW IT HAD MEANT NOTHING TO HIM BEFORE NOW STRANGE AS IT MAY SOUND IT MEANT A ROSE CASH CLO
6535-114962-0020 HE HAD AN OLD DRESS SUIT IN HIS WARDROBE PERHAPS THAT WOULD BUY A ROSE SO LEANING THROUGH THE WINDOW HE CALLED DOWN TO THE VOICE TO COME UP THE GENTLEMAN FROM PALESTINE CAME UP
6535-114962-0021 IT WOULD BE EASY TO DESCRIBE THE CONTEMPT WITH WHICH HE SURVEYED THE DISTINGUISHED THOUGH SOMEWHAT ANCIENT GARMENTS THUS OFFERED TO HIM IN EXCHANGE FOR A ROSE HOW HE AFFECTED TO
6535-114962-0022 EXAMINE LININGS AND SEAMS KNOWING ALL THE TIME THE DISTINGUISHED TAILOR THAT HAD MADE THEM AND WHAT A BARGAIN HE WAS ABOUT TO DRIVE OF COURSE THEY WEREN'T WELL REALLY
6535-114962-0023 THE POET WONDERED A MOMENT ABOUT THE COST OF A ROSE ARE THEY WORTH THE PRICE OF A ROSE HE ASKED
6535-114962-0024 THE GENTLEMAN FROM PALESTINE DIDN'T OF COURSE UNDERSTAND YOU SEE SAID HE FINALLY I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU MORE BUT
6535-114962-0025 HONESTLY I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THEM AT ALL BUT REALLY
6535-114962-0026 AND HE EYED THE POET'S CLOTHES WITH CONTEMPT A DOLLAR SEVENTY FIVE SAID THE POET STANDING FIRM ALL RIGHT AT LAST SAID THE GENTLEMAN FROM PALESTINE
6535-114962-0027 BUT I DON'T SEE WHERE I AM TO MAKE ANY PROFIT HOWEVER
6535-114962-0028 THEN THE POET BOWED HIM OUT GENTLY SAYING IN HIS HEART NOW I CAN BUY MY ROSE WHEN THE PALESTINIAN DEALER IN OLD DRESS SUITS WENT HOME
6535-114962-0029 AFTER SADLY LEAVING BEHIND HIM THAT DOLLAR SEVENTY FIVE HE MADE AN ASTONISHING DISCOVERY IN THE NECESSARY PROCESS OF RE EXAMINING THE GOODS
6535-114962-0030 SOMETHING FELL OUT OF ONE OF THE POCKETS SOMETHING THE POET AFTER HIS NATURE HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THE OLD CLOTHES MAN NOW A PUBLISHER
6535-114962-0031 PICKED THEM UP FROM THE FLOOR AND GAZED AT THEM IN DELIGHT THE POET IN HIS GRANDIOSE CARELESSNESS HAD FORGOTTEN TO EMPTY HIS POCKETS
6535-114962-0032 OF VARIOUS OLD DREAMS NOW TO BE FAIR TO THE GENTLEMAN FROM PALESTINE HE BELONGED TO A RACE THAT LOVES DREAMS AND TO DO HIM JUSTICE
6535-114962-0033 OF THE POOR POET'S CLOTHES AS HE SAT CROSS LEGGED ON THE FLOOR AND READ THE DREAMS THAT HAD FALLEN FROM THE POCKET OF THE POET'S OLD DRESS SUIT HE READ ON AND READ ON
6535-114962-0034 AND LAUGHED AND CRIED SUCH A CURIOUS TREASURE TROVE SUCH AN ODD MEDLEY OF FAIRY TALES AND FABLES AND POEMS HAD FALLEN OUT OF THE POET'S POCKET
6535-114962-0035 AND IT WAS ONLY LATER THAT THE THOUGHT CAME TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT CHANGE FROM AN OLD CLOTHES MAN INTO A PUBLISHER OF DREAMS NOW
