14-208-0000 CHAPTER ELEVEN THE MORROW BROUGHT A VERY SOBER LOOKING MORNING THE SUN MAKING ONLY A FEW EFFORTS TO APPEAR AND CATHERINE AUGURED FROM IT EVERYTHING MOST FAVOURABLE TO HER WISHES
14-208-0001 DECLINED GIVING ANY ABSOLUTE PROMISE OF SUNSHINE SHE APPLIED TO MISSUS ALLEN AND MISSUS ALLEN'S OPINION WAS MORE POSITIVE SHE HAD NO DOUBT IN THE WORLD OF ITS BEING A VERY FINE DAY IF THE CLOUDS WOULD ONLY GO OFF AND THE SUN KEEP OUT
14-208-0002 AT ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK HOWEVER A FEW SPECKS OF SMALL RAIN UPON THE WINDOWS CAUGHT CATHERINE'S WATCHFUL EYE AND OH DEAR I DO BELIEVE IT WILL BE WET BROKE FROM HER IN A MOST DESPONDING TONE
14-208-0003 I THOUGHT HOW IT WOULD BE SAID MISSUS ALLEN NO WALK FOR ME TODAY SIGHED CATHERINE BUT PERHAPS IT MAY COME TO NOTHING OR IT MAY HOLD UP BEFORE TWELVE PERHAPS IT MAY BUT THEN MY DEAR
14-208-0004 IT WILL BE SO DIRTY OH THAT WILL NOT SIGNIFY I NEVER MIND DIRT NO REPLIED HER FRIEND VERY PLACIDLY I KNOW YOU NEVER MIND DIRT AFTER A SHORT PAUSE
14-208-0005 IT COMES ON FASTER AND FASTER SAID CATHERINE AS SHE STOOD WATCHING AT A WINDOW SO IT DOES INDEED IF IT KEEPS RAINING THE STREETS WILL BE VERY WET THERE ARE FOUR UMBRELLAS UP ALREADY HOW I HATE THE SIGHT OF AN UMBRELLA
14-208-0006 THERE WILL BE VERY FEW PEOPLE IN THE PUMP ROOM IF IT RAINS ALL THE MORNING I HOPE MISTER ALLEN WILL PUT ON HIS GREATCOAT WHEN HE GOES BUT I DARE SAY HE WILL NOT FOR HE HAD RATHER DO ANYTHING IN THE WORLD THAN WALK OUT IN A GREATCOAT I WONDER HE SHOULD DISLIKE IT IT MUST BE SO COMFORTABLE
14-208-0007 THE RAIN CONTINUED FAST THOUGH NOT HEAVY CATHERINE WENT EVERY FIVE MINUTES TO THE CLOCK THREATENING ON EACH RETURN THAT IF IT STILL KEPT ON RAINING ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES SHE WOULD GIVE UP THE MATTER AS HOPELESS
14-208-0008 THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE AND IT STILL RAINED YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GO MY DEAR I DO NOT QUITE DESPAIR YET I SHALL NOT GIVE IT UP TILL A QUARTER AFTER TWELVE
14-208-0009 THIS IS JUST THE TIME OF DAY FOR IT TO CLEAR UP AND I DO THINK IT LOOKS A LITTLE LIGHTER THERE IT IS TWENTY MINUTES AFTER TWELVE AND NOW I SHALL GIVE IT UP ENTIRELY OH THAT WE HAD SUCH WEATHER HERE AS THEY HAD AT UDOLPHO
14-208-0010 OR AT LEAST IN TUSCANY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE THE NIGHT THAT POOR SAINT AUBIN DIED SUCH BEAUTIFUL WEATHER AT HALF PAST TWELVE WHEN CATHERINE'S ANXIOUS ATTENTION TO THE WEATHER WAS OVER AND SHE COULD NO LONGER CLAIM ANY MERIT FROM ITS AMENDMENT
14-208-0011 THAT A BRIGHT AFTERNOON WOULD SUCCEED AND JUSTIFIED THE OPINION OF MISSUS ALLEN WHO HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD CLEAR UP BUT WHETHER CATHERINE MIGHT STILL EXPECT HER FRIENDS WHETHER THERE HAD NOT BEEN TOO MUCH RAIN FOR MISS TILNEY TO VENTURE MUST YET BE A QUESTION
14-208-0012 IT WAS TOO DIRTY FOR MISSUS ALLEN TO ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND TO THE PUMP ROOM HE ACCORDINGLY SET OFF BY HIMSELF AND CATHERINE HAD BARELY WATCHED HIM DOWN THE STREET WHEN HER NOTICE WAS CLAIMED BY THE APPROACH OF THE SAME TWO OPEN CARRIAGES
14-208-0013 CONTAINING THE SAME THREE PEOPLE THAT HAD SURPRISED HER SO MUCH A FEW MORNINGS BACK ISABELLA MY BROTHER AND MISTER THORPE I DECLARE THEY ARE COMING FOR ME PERHAPS BUT I SHALL NOT GO I CANNOT GO INDEED
14-208-0014 FOR YOU KNOW MISS TILNEY MAY STILL CALL MISSUS ALLEN AGREED TO IT JOHN THORPE WAS SOON WITH THEM AND HIS VOICE WAS WITH THEM YET SOONER FOR ON THE STAIRS HE WAS CALLING OUT TO MISS MORLAND TO BE QUICK MAKE HASTE MAKE HASTE AS HE THREW OPEN THE DOOR
14-208-0015 THIS WAS OF COURSE VEHEMENTLY TALKED DOWN AS NO REASON AT ALL MISSUS ALLEN WAS CALLED ON TO SECOND HIM AND THE TWO OTHERS WALKED IN TO GIVE THEIR ASSISTANCE MY SWEETEST CATHERINE IS NOT THIS DELIGHTFUL WE SHALL HAVE A MOST HEAVENLY DRIVE
14-208-0016 YOU ARE TO THANK YOUR BROTHER AND ME FOR THE SCHEME IT DARTED INTO OUR HEADS AT BREAKFAST TIME I VERILY BELIEVE AT THE SAME INSTANT AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OFF TWO HOURS AGO IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THIS DETESTABLE RAIN BUT IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY THE NIGHTS ARE MOONLIGHT AND WE SHALL DO DELIGHTFULLY
14-208-0017 OH I AM IN SUCH ECSTASIES AT THE THOUGHTS OF A LITTLE COUNTRY AIR AND QUIET SO MUCH BETTER THAN GOING TO THE LOWER ROOMS WE SHALL DRIVE DIRECTLY TO CLIFTON AND DINE THERE
14-208-0018 I DOUBT OUR BEING ABLE TO DO SO MUCH SAID MORLAND YOU CROAKING FELLOW CRIED THORPE WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DO TEN TIMES MORE KINGSWESTON AYE AND BLAIZE CASTLE TOO AND ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN HEAR OF
14-208-0019 BUT HERE IS YOUR SISTER SAYS SHE WILL NOT GO BLAIZE CASTLE CRIED CATHERINE WHAT IS THAT THE FINEST PLACE IN ENGLAND WORTH GOING FIFTY MILES AT ANY TIME TO SEE
14-208-0020 WHAT IS IT REALLY A CASTLE AN OLD CASTLE THE OLDEST IN THE KINGDOM
14-208-0021 THEY PROMISED TO COME AT TWELVE ONLY IT RAINED BUT NOW AS IT IS SO FINE I DARE SAY THEY WILL BE HERE SOON NOT THEY INDEED CRIED THORPE FOR AS WE TURNED INTO BROAD STREET I SAW THEM DOES HE NOT DRIVE A PHAETON WITH BRIGHT CHESTNUTS
14-208-0022 I DO NOT KNOW INDEED YES I KNOW HE DOES I SAW HIM YOU ARE TALKING OF THE MAN YOU DANCED WITH LAST NIGHT ARE NOT YOU YES WELL I SAW HIM AT THAT MOMENT TURN UP THE LANSDOWN ROAD DRIVING A SMART LOOKING GIRL
14-208-0023 IT IS VERY ODD BUT I SUPPOSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TOO DIRTY FOR A WALK AND WELL THEY MIGHT FOR I NEVER SAW SO MUCH DIRT IN MY LIFE WALK YOU COULD NO MORE WALK THAN YOU COULD FLY IT HAS NOT BEEN SO DIRTY THE WHOLE WINTER IT IS ANKLE DEEP EVERYWHERE
14-208-0024 ISABELLA CORROBORATED IT MY DEAREST CATHERINE YOU CANNOT FORM AN IDEA OF THE DIRT COME YOU MUST GO YOU CANNOT REFUSE GOING NOW I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CASTLE BUT MAY WE GO ALL OVER IT
14-208-0025 MAY WE GO UP EVERY STAIRCASE AND INTO EVERY SUITE OF ROOMS YES YES EVERY HOLE AND CORNER BUT THEN IF THEY SHOULD ONLY BE GONE OUT FOR AN HOUR TILL IT IS DRYER AND CALL BY AND BY
14-208-0026 MAKE YOURSELF EASY THERE IS NO DANGER OF THAT FOR I HEARD TILNEY HALLOOING TO A MAN WHO WAS JUST PASSING BY ON HORSEBACK THAT THEY WERE GOING AS FAR AS WICK ROCKS THEN I WILL SHALL I GO MISSUS ALLEN
14-208-0027 AND IN TWO MINUTES THEY WERE OFF CATHERINE'S FEELINGS AS SHE GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE
14-208-0028 DIVIDED BETWEEN REGRET FOR THE LOSS OF ONE GREAT PLEASURE AND THE HOPE OF SOON ENJOYING ANOTHER ALMOST ITS EQUAL IN DEGREE HOWEVER UNLIKE IN KIND SHE COULD NOT THINK THE TILNEYS HAD ACTED QUITE WELL BY HER
14-208-0029 IN SO READILY GIVING UP THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITHOUT SENDING HER ANY MESSAGE OF EXCUSE IT WAS NOW BUT AN HOUR LATER THAN THE TIME FIXED ON FOR THE BEGINNING OF THEIR WALK AND IN SPITE OF WHAT SHE HAD HEARD OF THE PRODIGIOUS ACCUMULATION OF DIRT IN THE COURSE OF THAT HOUR
14-208-0030 AS HER FANCY REPRESENTED BLAIZE CASTLE TO BE WAS SUCH A COUNTERPOISE OF GOOD AS MIGHT CONSOLE HER FOR ALMOST ANYTHING THEY PASSED BRISKLY DOWN PULTENEY STREET AND THROUGH LAURA PLACE WITHOUT THE EXCHANGE OF MANY WORDS
14-208-0031 THORPE TALKED TO HIS HORSE AND SHE MEDITATED BY TURNS ON BROKEN PROMISES AND BROKEN ARCHES PHAETONS AND FALSE HANGINGS TILNEYS AND TRAP DOORS AS THEY ENTERED ARGYLE BUILDINGS HOWEVER SHE WAS ROUSED BY THIS ADDRESS FROM HER COMPANION
14-208-0032 WHO IS THAT GIRL WHO LOOKED AT YOU SO HARD AS SHE WENT BY WHO WHERE ON THE RIGHT HAND PAVEMENT SHE MUST BE ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT NOW CATHERINE LOOKED ROUND AND SAW MISS TILNEY LEANING ON HER BROTHER'S ARM
14-208-0033 BUT TO WHAT PURPOSE DID SHE SPEAK THORPE ONLY LASHED HIS HORSE INTO A BRISKER TROT THE TILNEYS WHO HAD SOON CEASED TO LOOK AFTER HER WERE IN A MOMENT OUT OF SIGHT ROUND THE CORNER OF LAURA PLACE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WAS HERSELF WHISKED INTO THE MARKETPLACE
14-208-0034 STILL HOWEVER AND DURING THE LENGTH OF ANOTHER STREET SHE ENTREATED HIM TO STOP PRAY PRAY STOP MISTER THORPE I CANNOT GO ON I WILL NOT GO ON I MUST GO BACK TO MISS TILNEY BUT MISTER THORPE ONLY LAUGHED SMACKED HIS WHIP
14-208-0035 ENCOURAGED HIS HORSE MADE ODD NOISES AND DROVE ON AND CATHERINE ANGRY AND VEXED AS SHE WAS HAVING NO POWER OF GETTING AWAY WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE UP THE POINT AND SUBMIT HER REPROACHES HOWEVER WERE NOT SPARED
14-208-0036 HOW COULD YOU DECEIVE ME SO MISTER THORPE HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT YOU SAW THEM DRIVING UP THE LANSDOWN ROAD I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD IT HAPPEN SO FOR THE WORLD THEY MUST THINK IT SO STRANGE SO RUDE OF ME TO GO BY THEM TOO WITHOUT SAYING A WORD
14-208-0037 YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW VEXED I AM I SHALL HAVE NO PLEASURE AT CLIFTON NOR IN ANYTHING ELSE I HAD RATHER TEN THOUSAND TIMES RATHER GET OUT NOW AND WALK BACK TO THEM HOW COULD YOU SAY YOU SAW THEM DRIVING OUT IN A PHAETON THORPE DEFENDED HIMSELF VERY STOUTLY
14-208-0038 DECLARED HE HAD NEVER SEEN TWO MEN SO MUCH ALIKE IN HIS LIFE AND WOULD HARDLY GIVE UP THE POINT OF ITS HAVING BEEN TILNEY HIMSELF THEIR DRIVE EVEN WHEN THIS SUBJECT WAS OVER WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE VERY AGREEABLE
14-208-0039 CATHERINE'S COMPLAISANCE WAS NO LONGER WHAT IT HAD BEEN IN THEIR FORMER AIRING SHE LISTENED RELUCTANTLY AND HER REPLIES WERE SHORT BLAIZE CASTLE REMAINED HER ONLY COMFORT TOWARDS THAT SHE STILL LOOKED AT INTERVALS WITH PLEASURE
14-208-0040 THOUGH RATHER THAN BE DISAPPOINTED OF THE PROMISED WALK AND ESPECIALLY RATHER THAN BE THOUGHT ILL OF BY THE TILNEYS SHE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE GIVEN UP ALL THE HAPPINESS WHICH ITS WALLS COULD SUPPLY THE HAPPINESS OF A PROGRESS THROUGH A LONG SUITE OF LOFTY ROOMS
14-208-0041 EXHIBITING THE REMAINS OF MAGNIFICENT FURNITURE THOUGH NOW FOR MANY YEARS DESERTED THE HAPPINESS OF BEING STOPPED IN THEIR WAY ALONG NARROW WINDING VAULTS BY A LOW GRATED DOOR
14-208-0042 OR EVEN OF HAVING THEIR LAMP THEIR ONLY LAMP EXTINGUISHED BY A SUDDEN GUST OF WIND AND OF BEING LEFT IN TOTAL DARKNESS IN THE MEANWHILE THEY PROCEEDED ON THEIR JOURNEY WITHOUT ANY MISCHANCE AND WERE WITHIN VIEW OF THE TOWN OF KEYNSHAM
14-208-0043 MADE HIS FRIEND PULL UP TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE MATTER THE OTHERS THEN CAME CLOSE ENOUGH FOR CONVERSATION AND MORLAND SAID WE HAD BETTER GO BACK THORPE IT IS TOO LATE TO GO ON TODAY
14-208-0044 IT IS ALL ONE TO ME REPLIED THORPE RATHER ANGRILY AND INSTANTLY TURNING HIS HORSE THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY BACK TO BATH
14-208-0045 SAID HE SOON AFTERWARDS WE MIGHT HAVE DONE IT VERY WELL
14-208-0046 AND I HAVE ALMOST BROKE MY ARM WITH PULLING HIM IN TO THAT CURSED BROKEN WINDED JADE'S PACE MORLAND IS A FOOL FOR NOT KEEPING A HORSE AND GIG OF HIS OWN NO HE IS NOT SAID CATHERINE WARMLY
14-208-0047 AND THAT IF PEOPLE WHO ROLLED IN MONEY COULD NOT AFFORD THINGS HE DID NOT KNOW WHO COULD WHICH CATHERINE DID NOT EVEN ENDEAVOUR TO UNDERSTAND DISAPPOINTED OF WHAT WAS TO HAVE BEEN THE CONSOLATION FOR HER FIRST DISAPPOINTMENT
14-208-0048 SHE WAS LESS AND LESS DISPOSED EITHER TO BE AGREEABLE HERSELF OR TO FIND HER COMPANION SO AND THEY RETURNED TO PULTENEY STREET WITHOUT HER SPEAKING TWENTY WORDS AS SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE THE FOOTMAN TOLD HER THAT A GENTLEMAN AND LADY HAD CALLED
14-208-0049 AND INQUIRED FOR HER A FEW MINUTES AFTER HER SETTING OFF THAT WHEN HE TOLD THEM SHE WAS GONE OUT WITH MISTER THORPE THE LADY HAD ASKED WHETHER ANY MESSAGE HAD BEEN LEFT FOR HER AND ON HIS SAYING NO HAD FELT FOR A CARD BUT SAID SHE HAD NONE ABOUT HER AND WENT AWAY
14-208-0050 PONDERING OVER THESE HEART RENDING TIDINGS CATHERINE WALKED SLOWLY UPSTAIRS AT THE HEAD OF THEM SHE WAS MET BY MISTER ALLEN WHO ON HEARING THE REASON OF THEIR SPEEDY RETURN
14-208-0051 A VERY GOOD EQUIVALENT FOR THE QUIET AND COUNTRY AIR OF AN INN AT CLIFTON HER SATISFACTION TOO IN NOT BEING AT THE LOWER ROOMS WAS SPOKEN MORE THAN ONCE HOW I PITY THE POOR CREATURES THAT ARE GOING THERE
14-208-0052 I DARE SAY IT WILL NOT BE A VERY GOOD BALL I KNOW THE MITCHELLS WILL NOT BE THERE I AM SURE I PITY EVERYBODY THAT IS BUT I DARE SAY MISTER MORLAND YOU LONG TO BE AT IT DO NOT YOU I AM SURE YOU DO
14-208-0053 WELL PRAY DO NOT LET ANYBODY HERE BE A RESTRAINT ON YOU I DARE SAY WE COULD DO VERY WELL WITHOUT YOU BUT YOU MEN THINK YOURSELVES OF SUCH CONSEQUENCE CATHERINE COULD ALMOST HAVE ACCUSED ISABELLA OF BEING WANTING IN TENDERNESS TOWARDS HERSELF AND HER SORROWS
14-208-0054 SO VERY LITTLE DID THEY APPEAR TO DWELL ON HER MIND AND SO VERY INADEQUATE WAS THE COMFORT SHE OFFERED DO NOT BE SO DULL MY DEAREST CREATURE SHE WHISPERED YOU WILL QUITE BREAK MY HEART IT WAS AMAZINGLY SHOCKING TO BE SURE
14-208-0055 BUT THE TILNEYS WERE ENTIRELY TO BLAME WHY WERE NOT THEY MORE PUNCTUAL IT WAS DIRTY INDEED BUT WHAT DID THAT SIGNIFY I AM SURE JOHN AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE MINDED IT I NEVER MIND GOING THROUGH ANYTHING WHERE A FRIEND IS CONCERNED THAT IS MY DISPOSITION
14-208-0056 AND NOW I MAY DISMISS MY HEROINE TO THE SLEEPLESS COUCH WHICH IS THE TRUE HEROINE'S PORTION TO A PILLOW STREWED WITH THORNS AND WET WITH TEARS
