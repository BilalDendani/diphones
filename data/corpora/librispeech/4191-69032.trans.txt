4191-69032-0008 AND FOR BEAUTY IN TEARS HE WOULD CHEERFULLY LAY DOWN HIS LIFE
4191-69032-0009 BUT RUSHED UP STAIRS JUST IN TIME TO RECEIVE THE FALLING FORM OF MISSUS CHIFFIELD IN HIS ARMS MATTHEW FELT THAT HE HAD NO MORAL RIGHT TO CLASP THAT BURDEN OF LOVELINESS
4191-69032-0010 BUT HE TOOK IT TENDERLY IN HIS ARMS AND FOLLOWED MISTER WHEDELL INTO THE ROOM WHICH FATHER AND DAUGHTER HAD JUST LEFT THERE HE DEPOSITED IT WITH THE GENTLENESS OF A PROFESSIONAL NURSE ON THE SOFA
4191-69032-0011 WHEN IT OPENED ITS EYES AND FAINTLY SAID HEAVEN BLESS YOU OUR BENEFACTOR THE CREDITORS WERE POURING INTO THE APARTMENT IN THE NAME OF HUMANITY SAID MISTER WHEDELL
4191-69032-0012 LEAVE US FOR A FEW MOMENTS I APPEAL TO YOU AS GENTLEMEN AND CHRISTIANS THE APPEAL PRODUCED NO EFFECT THOSE TO WHOM IT WAS MADE CONCEIVING PERHAPS THAT IT DID NOT APPLY TO THEM

4191-69032-0014 THE PROPOSITION WAS ACCEPTED AS THE BEST THING THAT COULD BE DONE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND ALL THE CREDITORS RETIRED
4191-69032-0015 IN THE CHIFFIELD ALLIANCE CLEMENTINA CORROBORATED THE PATERNAL STATEMENT WITH NUMEROUS PARTICULARS DELIVERED IN A HEART BROKEN VOICE SHOWING WHAT AN ABANDONED WRETCH HER HUSBAND WAS
4191-69032-0016 MATTHEW LISTENED NODDED HIS HEAD AND SAID THE BRUTE
4191-69032-0017 AT INTERVALS LOOKING THE WHILE INTO THE DEEP BLUE EYES OF MISSUS CHIFFIELD WHICH SPARKLED WITH TEARS IF HE HAD BUT BEEN THE LUCKY MAN HE THOUGHT BUT IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO MATTHEW
4191-69032-0018 THAT THESE THOUGHTS WERE A LITTLE IRREGULAR AND BESIDES HE HAD A FRESH RECOLLECTION OF THE TROUBLES FROM WHICH FAYETTE OVERTOP HAD NOT YET EMERGED
4191-69032-0019 HE THEREFORE PULLED OUT HIS WATCH AND INFORMED MISTER WHEDELL THAT THIRTEEN OF THE FIFTEEN MINUTES WERE CONSUMED
4191-69032-0020 MISTER WHEDELL TAKING THE HINT CAME DOWN TO BUSINESS HIS AFFAIRS WERE OF A KIND THAT WERE EASILY SETTLED HE OWNED NOTHING EXCEPT HIS PERSONAL CLOTHING AND A FEW SMALL ARTICLES OF FURNITURE
4191-69032-0021 EVERYTHING ELSE HAD BEEN OBTAINED ON CREDIT AND EITHER NOT PAID FOR OR ONLY PARTLY PAID FOR THIS STATEMENT OF AFFAIRS OCCUPIED ONE MINUTE A MINUTE REMAINED WHICH MISTER WHEDELL PUT TO GOOD USE
4191-69032-0022 HE LOOKED APPEALINGLY AT MALTBOY SO DID MISSUS CHIFFIELD MY DEAR FRIEND SAID MISTER WHEDELL I FIND MYSELF AT AN ADVANCED PERIOD OF LIFE IN THIS COLD WORLD
4191-69032-0023 DESERTED PENNILESS YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON LIVING THAT I CAN CALL BY THE SACRED NAME OF FRIEND I HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED YOUR NOBLE BOUNTY IN A LOAN OF TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS
4191-69032-0024 TRAMPS OF CREDITORS BECOMING LOUDER OUTSIDE IN A WORD SIR CAN YOU LEND ME ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE IT WILL AT LEAST SAVE ME FROM THE SELF DESTRUCTION WHICH I HAD CONTEMPLATED
4191-69032-0025 AT THE WORD SELF DESTRUCTION MISSUS CHIFFIELD CRIED ALOUD AND THREW HERSELF ON HER PARENT'S BREAST WITH A FRESH FLOOD OF TEARS THESE TEARS SWEPT AWAY THE LAST TRACE OF MATTHEW'S PRUDENCE
4191-69032-0026 HE WHIPPED OUT HIS POCKET BOOK AND DELIVERED OVER FIVE TWENTY DOLLAR GOLD PIECES TO MISTER WHEDELL THE SIGHT OF THOSE BEAUTIFUL COINS SEEMED TO RECONCILE THE WRETCHED MAN TO LIFE
4191-69032-0027 MISTER WHEDELL WAS ABOUT TO THANK HIS PRESERVER MOST PROFUSELY AND MISSUS CHIFFIELD TO BURST INTO A NEW TORRENT WHEN MATTHEW TO AVOID THESE DEMONSTRATIONS ROSE OPENED THE DOOR
4191-69032-0028 AND LET IN THE PACK OF HUNGRY CREDITORS NOW MATTHEW HAD IN THESE FLEETING FIFTEEN MINUTES THOUGHT UP NO PLAN OF SETTLEMENT
4191-69032-0029 BEING TAKEN ABACK BY THE SUDDEN REAPPEARANCE OF THE CREDITORS HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO PROPOSE EVERYTHING FIXED I S'POSE SAID RICKARTS THE SHOEMAKER
4191-69032-0030 WHEN MATTHEW WAS IN STRONG DOUBT WHAT TO DO IN ANY CASE IT WAS HIS INVARIABLE CUSTOM TO POSTPONE I THINK HE FEEBLY SUGGESTED THAT WE HAD BETTER POSTPONE FINAL ACTION SAY TILL THREE P M
4191-69032-0031 IT WOULD GIVE US TIME CAN'T COME IT NO GO NOW OR NEVER WERE SOME OF THE EXCLAMATIONS WHICH WENT UP FROM THE EXCITED CROWD
4191-69032-0032 MATTHEW WAS TOO GOOD NATURED TO QUARREL WITH THESE INSINUATIONS MY FRIENDS SAID HE AS YOU APPEAR TO HAVE UNLIMITED CONFIDENCE IN EACH OTHER
4191-69032-0033 SUPPOSE YOU APPOINT A COMMITTEE TO DISPOSE OF THIS PROPERTY WHICH MY CLIENT GENEROUSLY CRIES OF OH OH TURNS OVER TO YOU AND DIVIDE THE PROCEEDS AMONG YOURSELVES PRO RATA
4191-69032-0034 THE CREDITORS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER SUSPICIOUSLY A WANT OF THAT CHILDLIKE TRUST WHICH IN A PERFECT STATE OF SOCIETY SHOULD EXIST BETWEEN MAN AND MAN WAS UNHAPPILY TOO APPARENT
4191-69032-0035 JUST THEN WHEN MATTHEW WAS AT HIS WITS END THE POLICE MAN WHO GUARDED THE FRONT DOOR ENTERED THE ROOM AND DELIVERED A NOTE TO MISTER WHEDELL THAT GENTLEMAN PERUSED IT LANGUIDLY AND PASSED IT TO MATTHEW
4191-69032-0036 GOOD NEWS SAID HE MISTER ABERNUCKLE THE OWNER OF THESE PREMISES WHO WAS INTENDING TO MOVE IN TO DAY WRITES THAT HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE POSSESSION UNTIL NOON TO MORROW
4191-69032-0037 THEREFORE I SAY LET THE CREDITORS EMPLOY AN AUCTIONEER HANG OUT THE RED FLAG SELL AND DIVIDE BEFORE THAT PERIOD ARRIVES THE LARGE CREDITORS WERE SILENT
4191-69032-0038 QUIGG VEILING HIS DISSATISFACTION UNDER A LOOK OF COMPLETE MISANTHROPY BUT THE SMALL ONES HEADED BY RICKARTS THE SHOEMAKER HIGHLY COMMENDED IT BESIDES ADDED A BUTTER MAN
4191-69032-0039 WHO HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN IN THE MOCK AUCTION LINE DON'T YE SEE WE CAN ALL STAY AT THE AUCTION AND KIND O BID ON THE THINGS HEY THE BUTTER MAN NODDED AT THE LESSER CREDITORS
4191-69032-0040 THE IDEA TOOK ONLY A FEW OF THE LARGER CREDITORS HOLDING OUT AGAINST IT MY FRIENDS AGAIN OBSERVED MATTHEW DRAWING ON HIS STORES OF LEGAL KNOWLEDGE YOU SEEM TO FORGET THAT
4191-69032-0041 IF MY CLIENT CHOSE TO RESIST YOUR CLAIMS HE COULD RETAIN A LARGE AMOUNT OF FURNITURE AS HOUSEHOLD ARTICLES UNDER THE LAW WHICH EXEMPTS CERTAIN NECESSARY THINGS
4191-69032-0042 BUT WITH RARE MAGNANIMITY HE GIVES UP ALL THE ALLUSION TO MAGNANIMITY PRODUCED SOME DERISIVE LAUGHS WHICH SLIGHTLY NETTLED MATTHEW AUCTION IT OFF SAID HE
4191-69032-0043 OR WE THROW OURSELVES BACK ON OUR RESERVED RIGHTS AT THIS HINT EVERYBODY GAVE IN AND A COMMITTEE CONSISTING OF QUIGG RICKARTS AND THE BUTTER MAN
4191-69032-0044 WAS APPOINTED TO MAKE ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR AN IMMEDIATE SALE IT IS NOT PLEASANT TO PURSUE THIS PAINFUL THEME THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE WHEDELL HOUSEHOLD FARTHER
4191-69032-0045 LET THE HISTORIAN BARELY RECORD THAT THE SALE ATTRACTED A LARGE CROWD AND THAT BY THE INGENIOUS SIDE BIDS OF THE CREDITORS THE FURNITURE WAS RUN UP TO TWICE ITS ORIGINAL VALUE
4191-69032-0046 NO UNCOMMON THING AT AUCTIONS THAT THE CREDITORS LARGE AND SMALL WERE WELL SATISFIED WITH THE RESULTS THAT MISTER WHEDELL AND DAUGHTER
4191-69032-0047 MOVED TO BOSTON AND BECAME STIPENDIARIES UPON A YOUNGER BROTHER WHO HAD MADE A FORTUNE IN THE UPHOLSTERY BUSINESS AND WHOM MISTER WHEDELL HAD ALWAYS DESPISED THAT MISTER CHIFFIELD
4191-69032-0048 TOOK TO DRINK TENACIOUSLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS MISFORTUNES AND NEVER SAW OR SOUGHT AFTER HIS WIFE FROM THE DAY WHEN HE DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS DOWERLESS
4191-69032-0049 THAT MISSUS CHIFFIELD OBTAINED A DIVORCE FROM THE BONDS OF MATRIMONY BUT HAD NOT MARRIED AGAIN AT LAST ACCOUNTS
