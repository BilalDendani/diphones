7120-118112-0042 PROVIDING THE SHIPPING MASTER COULD HAVE IT IN READINESS TO SUIT THEIR CONVENIENCE BUT AS THESE CAPTAINS HAD A NUMBER OF ENGAGEMENTS AT RICHMOND
7120-118112-0043 TO RELY UPON EITHER OF THEM CONSEQUENTLY IN ORDER TO BE PREPARED IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY THE MATTER WAS LAID BEFORE TWO PROFESSIONAL GENTLEMEN WHO WERE EACH OCCUPYING CHAIRS IN ONE OF THE MEDICAL COLLEGES OF PHILADELPHIA
