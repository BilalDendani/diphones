622-121659-0000 THE WOND'ROUS WISE MAN
622-121659-0001 HE JUMPED INTO A BRAMBLE BUSH AND SCRATCHED OUT BOTH HIS EYES AND WHEN HE SAW HIS EYES WERE OUT WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND MAIN HE JUMPED INTO ANOTHER BUSH AND SCRATCHED THEM IN AGAIN
622-121659-0002 OUR TOWN IS A QUIET LITTLE TOWN AND LIES NESTLING IN A LITTLE VALLEY SURROUNDED BY PRETTY GREEN HILLS I DO NOT THINK YOU WOULD EVER HAVE HEARD OUR TOWN MENTIONED
622-121659-0003 HAD NOT THE MAN LIVED THERE WHO WAS SO WISE THAT EVERYONE MARVELLED AT HIS GREAT KNOWLEDGE HE WAS NOT ALWAYS A WISE MAN HE WAS A WISE BOY BEFORE HE GREW TO MANHOOD
622-121659-0004 AND EVEN WHEN A CHILD HE WAS SO REMARKABLE FOR HIS WISDOM THAT PEOPLE SHOOK THEIR HEADS GRAVELY AND SAID WHEN HE GROWS UP THERE WILL BE NO NEED OF BOOKS FOR HE WILL KNOW EVERYTHING
622-121659-0005 HIS FATHER THOUGHT HE HAD A WOND'ROUS WISE LOOK WHEN HE WAS BORN AND SO HE NAMED HIM SOLOMON THINKING THAT IF INDEED HE TURNED OUT TO BE WISE THE NAME WOULD FIT HIM NICELY WHEREAS SHOULD HE BE MISTAKEN AND THE BOY GROW UP STUPID
622-121659-0006 BUT THE FATHER WAS NOT MISTAKEN AND THE BOY'S NAME REMAINED SOLOMON WHEN HE WAS STILL A CHILD SOLOMON CONFOUNDED THE SCHOOLMASTER BY ASKING ONE DAY CAN YOU TELL ME SIR
622-121659-0007 WHY A COW DRINKS WATER FROM A BROOK WELL REALLY REPLIED THE ABASHED SCHOOLMASTER I HAVE NEVER GIVEN THE SUBJECT SERIOUS THOUGHT BUT
622-121659-0008 I WILL SLEEP UPON THE QUESTION AND TRY TO GIVE YOU AN ANSWER TO MORROW BUT THE SCHOOLMASTER COULD NOT SLEEP HE REMAINED AWAKE ALL THE NIGHT TRYING TO THINK WHY A COW DRINKS WATER FROM A BROOK
622-121659-0009 AND IN THE MORNING HE WAS NO NEARER THE ANSWER THAN BEFORE SO HE WAS OBLIGED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE WISE CHILD AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE COULD NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM I HAVE LOOKED AT THE SUBJECT FROM EVERY SIDE SAID HE
622-121659-0010 AND GIVEN IT CAREFUL THOUGHT AND YET I CANNOT TELL WHY A COW DRINKS WATER FROM A BROOK SIR REPLIED THE WISE CHILD IT IS BECAUSE THE COW IS THIRSTY
622-121659-0011 THE SHOCK OF THIS ANSWER WAS SO GREAT THAT THE SCHOOLMASTER FAINTED AWAY AND WHEN THEY HAD BROUGHT HIM TO HE MADE A PROPHECY THAT SOLOMON WOULD GROW UP TO BE A WOND'ROUS WISE MAN
622-121659-0012 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH THE VILLAGE DOCTOR SOLOMON CAME TO HIM ONE DAY AND ASKED TELL ME SIR WHY HAS A MAN TWO EYES
622-121659-0013 FOR I HAVE NEVER YET HAD MY ATTENTION CALLED TO THIS SUBJECT SO HE THOUGHT FOR A LONG TIME AND THEN HE SAID I MUST REALLY GIVE IT UP I CANNOT TELL FOR THE LIFE OF ME WHY A MAN HAS TWO EYES
622-121659-0014 DO YOU KNOW YES SIR ANSWERED THE BOY THEN SAID THE DOCTOR AFTER TAKING A DOSE OF QUININE TO BRACE UP HIS NERVES FOR HE REMEMBERED THE FATE OF THE SCHOOLMASTER
622-121659-0015 THEN PLEASE TELL ME WHY A MAN AS TWO EYES A MAN HAS TWO EYES SIR RETURNED SOLOMON SOLEMNLY BECAUSE HE WAS BORN THAT WAY
622-121659-0016 AND THE DOCTOR MARVELLED GREATLY AT SO MUCH WISDOM IN A LITTLE CHILD AND MADE A NOTE OF IT IN HIS NOTE BOOK SOLOMON WAS SO FULL OF WISDOM THAT IT FLOWED FROM HIS MOUTH IN A
622-121659-0017 PERFECT STREAM AND EVERY DAY HE GAVE NEW EVIDENCE TO HIS FRIENDS THAT HE COULD SCARCELY HOLD ALL THE WISE THOUGHTS THAT CAME TO HIM FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY HE SAID TO HIS FATHER
622-121659-0018 OH NO REPLIED HIS FATHER
622-121659-0019 YOU ARE SURELY MISTAKEN SIR SAID SOLOMON WITH THE GRAVITY THAT COMES FROM GREAT WISDOM THESE ARE OUR DOG'S FORE LEGS ARE THEY NOT POINTING TO THE FRONT LEGS OF THE DOG YES
622-121659-0020 ANSWERED HIS FATHER WELL CONTINUED SOLOMON THE DOG HAS TWO OTHER LEGS BESIDES AND TWO AND FOUR ARE SIX THEREFORE THE DOG HAS SIX LEGS
622-121659-0021 BUT THAT IS VERY OLD EXCLAIMED HIS FATHER TRUE REPLIED SOLOMON BUT THIS IS A YOUNG DOG THEN HIS FATHER BOWED HIS HEAD IN SHAME THAT HIS OWN CHILD SHOULD TEACH HIM WISDOM
622-121659-0022 OF COURSE SOLOMON WORE GLASSES UPON HIS EYES ALL WISE PEOPLE WEAR THEM AND HIS FACE WAS EVER GRAVE AND SOLEMN WHILE HE WALKED SLOWLY AND STIFFLY SO THAT PEOPLE MIGHT KNOW HE WAS THE CELEBRATED WISE MAN
622-121659-0023 AND DO HIM REVERENCE AND WHEN HE HAD GROWN TO MANHOOD THE FAME OF HIS WISDOM SPREAD ALL OVER THE WORLD SO THAT ALL THE OTHER WISE MEN WERE JEALOUS AND TRIED IN MANY WAYS TO CONFOUND HIM
622-121659-0024 BUT SOLOMON ALWAYS CAME OUT AHEAD AND MAINTAINED HIS REPUTATION FOR WISDOM FINALLY A VERY WISE MAN CAME FROM CUMBERLAND TO MEET SOLOMON AND SEE WHICH OF THEM WAS THE WISEST
622-121659-0025 HE WAS A VERY BIG MAN AND SOLOMON WAS A VERY LITTLE MAN AND SO THE PEOPLE ALL SHOOK THEIR HEADS SADLY AND FEARED SOLOMON HAD MET HIS MATCH FOR IF THE CUMBERLAND MAN WAS AS FULL OF WISDOM AS SOLOMON
622-121659-0026 HE HAD MUCH THE ADVANTAGE IN SIZE THEY FORMED A CIRCLE AROUND THE TWO WISE MEN AND THEN BEGAN THE TRIAL TO SEE WHICH WAS THE WISEST TELL ME
622-121659-0027 SAID SOLOMON LOOKING STRAIGHT UP INTO THE BIG MAN'S FACE WITH AN AIR OF CONFIDENCE THAT REASSURED HIS FRIENDS HOW MANY SISTERS HAS A BOY WHO HAS ONE FATHER ONE MOTHER AND SEVEN BROTHERS
622-121659-0028 THE BIG WISE MAN GOT VERY RED IN THE FACE AND SCOWLED AND COUGHED AND STAMMERED BUT HE COULD NOT TELL I DO NOT KNOW HE ACKNOWLEDGED NOR DO YOU KNOW EITHER
622-121659-0029 FOR THERE IS NO RULE TO GO BY OH YES I KNOW REPLIED SOLOMON HE HAS TWO SISTERS I KNOW THIS IS THE TRUE ANSWER BECAUSE I KNOW THE BOY AND HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHER
622-121659-0030 AND HIS BROTHERS AND HIS SISTERS SO THAT I CANNOT BE MISTAKEN NOW ALL THE PEOPLE APPLAUDED AT THIS FOR THEY WERE SURE SOLOMON HAD GOT THE BEST OF THE MAN FROM CUMBERLAND
622-121659-0031 BUT IT WAS NOW THE BIG MAN'S TURN TO TRY SOLOMON SO HE SAID FINGERS FIVE ARE ON MY HAND ALL OF THEM UPRIGHT DO STAND
622-121659-0032 ONE A DOG IS CHASING KITTENS ONE A CAT IS WEARING MITTENS ONE A RAT IS EATING CHEESE ONE A WOLF IS FULL OF FLEAS
622-121659-0033 ONE A FLY IS IN A CUP HOW MANY FINGERS DO I HOLD UP FOUR REPLIED SOLOMON PROMPTLY FOR ONE OF THEM IS A THUMB
622-121659-0034 THE WISE MAN FROM CUMBERLAND WAS SO ANGRY AT BEING OUTWITTED THAT HE SPRANG AT SOLOMON AND WOULD NO DOUBT HAVE INJURED HIM HAD NOT OUR WISE MAN TURNED AND RUN AWAY AS FAST AS HE COULD GO
622-121659-0035 THE MAN FROM CUMBERLAND AT ONCE RAN AFTER HIM AND CHASED HIM THROUGH THE STREETS AND DOWN THE LANES AND UP THE SIDE OF THE HILL WHERE THE BRAMBLE BUSHES GROW SOLOMON RAN VERY FAST BUT THE MAN FROM CUMBERLAND WAS BIGGER
622-121659-0036 AND HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO GRAB OUR WISE MAN BY HIS COAT TAILS WHEN SOLOMON GAVE A GREAT JUMP AND JUMPED RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF A BIG BRAMBLE BUSH THE PEOPLE WERE ALL COMING UP BEHIND
622-121659-0037 AND AS THE BIG MAN DID NOT DARE TO FOLLOW SOLOMON INTO THE BRAMBLE BUSH HE TURNED AWAY AND RAN HOME TO CUMBERLAND ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR TOWN WERE HORRIFIED WHEN THEY CAME UP AND FOUND THEIR WISE MAN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BRAMBLE BUSH
622-121659-0038 AND HELD FAST BY THE BRAMBLES WHICH SCRATCHED AND PRICKED HIM ON EVERY SIDE SOLOMON ARE YOU HURT THEY CRIED I SHOULD SAY I AM HURT REPLIED SOLOMON WITH A GROAN
622-121659-0039 MY EYES ARE SCRATCHED OUT HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY ARE ASKED THE VILLAGE DOCTOR I CAN SEE THEY ARE SCRATCHED OUT REPLIED SOLOMON
622-121659-0040 AND THE PEOPLE ALL WEPT WITH GRIEF AT THIS AND SOLOMON HOWLED LOUDER THAN ANY OF THEM NOW THE FACT WAS THAT WHEN SOLOMON JUMPED INTO THE BRAMBLE BUSH HE WAS WEARING HIS SPECTACLES
622-121659-0041 AND THE BRAMBLES PUSHED THE GLASSES SO CLOSE AGAINST HIS EYES THAT HE COULD NOT OPEN THEM AND SO AS EVERY OTHER PART OF HIM WAS SCRATCHED AND BLEEDING AND HE COULD NOT OPEN HIS EYES HE MADE SURE THEY WERE SCRATCHED OUT
622-121659-0042 HOW AM I TO GET OUT OF HERE HE ASKED AT LAST YOU MUST JUMP OUT REPLIED THE DOCTOR SINCE YOU HAVE JUMPED IN SO SOLOMON MADE A GREAT JUMP
622-121659-0043 AND ALTHOUGH THE BRAMBLES TORE HIM CRUELLY HE SPRANG ENTIRELY OUT OF THE BUSH AND FELL PLUMP INTO ANOTHER ONE THIS LAST BUSH HOWEVER BY GOOD LUCK WAS NOT A BRAMBLE BUSH BUT ONE OF ELDERBERRY
622-121659-0044 AND WHEN HE JUMPED INTO IT HIS SPECTACLES FELL OFF AND TO HIS SURPRISE HE OPENED HIS EYES AND FOUND THAT HE COULD SEE AGAIN
622-121659-0045 CALLED OUT THE DOCTOR I M IN THE ELDERBERRY BUSH AND I VE SCRATCHED MY EYES IN AGAIN ANSWERED SOLOMON WHEN THE PEOPLE HEARD THIS THEY MARVELLED GREATLY
622-121659-0046 AT THE WISDOM OF A MAN WHO KNEW HOW TO SCRATCH HIS EYES IN AFTER THEY WERE SCRATCHED OUT AND THEY LIFTED SOLOMON FROM THE BUSH AND CARRIED HIM HOME WHERE THEY BOUND UP THE SCRATCHES AND NURSED HIM CAREFULLY UNTIL HE WAS WELL AGAIN
622-121659-0047 AND AFTER THAT NO ONE EVER QUESTIONED THE WOND'ROUS WISDOM OF OUR WISE MAN AND WHEN HE FINALLY DIED AT A GOOD OLD AGE THEY BUILT A GREAT MONUMENT OVER HIS GRAVE
622-121659-0048 AND ON ONE SIDE OF IT WERE THE WORDS SOLOMON THE MAN WHO WAS WOND'ROUS WISE AND ON THE OTHER SIDE
