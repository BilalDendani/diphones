30-4445-0000 EMMA WOODHOUSE HANDSOME CLEVER AND RICH WITH A COMFORTABLE HOME AND HAPPY DISPOSITION SEEMED TO UNITE SOME OF THE BEST BLESSINGS OF EXISTENCE
30-4445-0001 AND HAD LIVED NEARLY TWENTY ONE YEARS IN THE WORLD WITH VERY LITTLE TO DISTRESS OR VEX HER SHE WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE TWO DAUGHTERS OF A MOST AFFECTIONATE INDULGENT FATHER AND HAD IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER SISTER'S MARRIAGE
30-4445-0002 BEEN MISTRESS OF HIS HOUSE FROM A VERY EARLY PERIOD HER MOTHER HAD DIED TOO LONG AGO FOR HER TO HAVE MORE THAN AN INDISTINCT REMEMBRANCE OF HER CARESSES AND HER PLACE HAD BEEN SUPPLIED BY AN EXCELLENT WOMAN AS GOVERNESS
30-4445-0003 WHO HAD FALLEN LITTLE SHORT OF A MOTHER IN AFFECTION SIXTEEN YEARS HAD MISS TAYLOR BEEN IN MISTER WOODHOUSE'S FAMILY LESS AS A GOVERNESS THAN A FRIEND VERY FOND OF BOTH DAUGHTERS BUT PARTICULARLY OF EMMA
30-4445-0004 BETWEEN THEM IT WAS MORE THE INTIMACY OF SISTERS EVEN BEFORE MISS TAYLOR HAD CEASED TO HOLD THE NOMINAL OFFICE OF GOVERNESS
30-4445-0005 AND THE SHADOW OF AUTHORITY BEING NOW LONG PASSED AWAY THEY HAD BEEN LIVING TOGETHER AS FRIEND AND FRIEND VERY MUTUALLY ATTACHED AND EMMA DOING JUST WHAT SHE LIKED HIGHLY ESTEEMING MISS TAYLOR'S JUDGMENT BUT DIRECTED CHIEFLY BY HER OWN
30-4445-0006 THE REAL EVILS INDEED OF EMMA'S SITUATION WERE THE POWER OF HAVING RATHER TOO MUCH HER OWN WAY AND A DISPOSITION TO THINK A LITTLE TOO WELL OF HERSELF THESE WERE THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH THREATENED ALLOY TO HER MANY ENJOYMENTS
30-4445-0007 THE DANGER HOWEVER WAS AT PRESENT SO UNPERCEIVED THAT THEY DID NOT BY ANY MEANS RANK AS MISFORTUNES WITH HER SORROW CAME A GENTLE SORROW BUT NOT AT ALL IN THE SHAPE OF ANY DISAGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS MISS TAYLOR MARRIED
30-4445-0008 IT WAS MISS TAYLOR'S LOSS WHICH FIRST BROUGHT GRIEF IT WAS ON THE WEDDING DAY OF THIS BELOVED FRIEND THAT EMMA FIRST SAT IN MOURNFUL THOUGHT OF ANY CONTINUANCE THE WEDDING OVER AND THE BRIDE PEOPLE GONE
30-4445-0009 HER FATHER AND HERSELF WERE LEFT TO DINE TOGETHER WITH NO PROSPECT OF A THIRD TO CHEER A LONG EVENING HER FATHER COMPOSED HIMSELF TO SLEEP AFTER DINNER AS USUAL
30-4445-0010 AND SHE HAD THEN ONLY TO SIT AND THINK OF WHAT SHE HAD LOST THE EVENT HAD EVERY PROMISE OF HAPPINESS FOR HER FRIEND MISTER WESTON WAS A MAN OF UNEXCEPTIONABLE CHARACTER EASY FORTUNE SUITABLE AGE AND PLEASANT MANNERS
30-4445-0011 AND THERE WAS SOME SATISFACTION IN CONSIDERING WITH WHAT SELF DENYING GENEROUS FRIENDSHIP SHE HAD ALWAYS WISHED AND PROMOTED THE MATCH BUT IT WAS A BLACK MORNING'S WORK FOR HER THE WANT OF MISS TAYLOR WOULD BE FELT EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY
30-4445-0012 AND HOW NURSED HER THROUGH THE VARIOUS ILLNESSES OF CHILDHOOD A LARGE DEBT OF GRATITUDE WAS OWING HERE BUT THE INTERCOURSE OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THE EQUAL FOOTING AND PERFECT UNRESERVE WHICH HAD SOON FOLLOWED ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE
30-4445-0013 ON THEIR BEING LEFT TO EACH OTHER WAS YET A DEARER TENDERER RECOLLECTION SHE HAD BEEN A FRIEND AND COMPANION SUCH AS FEW POSSESSED INTELLIGENT WELL INFORMED USEFUL GENTLE KNOWING ALL THE WAYS OF THE FAMILY
30-4445-0014 HOW WAS SHE TO BEAR THE CHANGE IT WAS TRUE THAT HER FRIEND WAS GOING ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM BUT EMMA WAS AWARE THAT GREAT MUST BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MISSUS WESTON ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM AND A MISS TAYLOR IN THE HOUSE
30-4445-0015 AND WITH ALL HER ADVANTAGES NATURAL AND DOMESTIC SHE WAS NOW IN GREAT DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM INTELLECTUAL SOLITUDE SHE DEARLY LOVED HER FATHER BUT HE WAS NO COMPANION FOR HER HE COULD NOT MEET HER IN CONVERSATION
30-4445-0016 RATIONAL OR PLAYFUL THE EVIL OF THE ACTUAL DISPARITY IN THEIR AGES AND MISTER WOODHOUSE HAD NOT MARRIED EARLY WAS MUCH INCREASED BY HIS CONSTITUTION AND HABITS FOR HAVING BEEN A VALETUDINARIAN ALL HIS LIFE
30-4445-0017 WITHOUT ACTIVITY OF MIND OR BODY HE WAS A MUCH OLDER MAN IN WAYS THAN IN YEARS AND THOUGH EVERYWHERE BELOVED FOR THE FRIENDLINESS OF HIS HEART AND HIS AMIABLE TEMPER HIS TALENTS COULD NOT HAVE RECOMMENDED HIM AT ANY TIME HER SISTER
30-4445-0018 BEFORE CHRISTMAS BROUGHT THE NEXT VISIT FROM ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND AND THEIR LITTLE CHILDREN TO FILL THE HOUSE AND GIVE HER PLEASANT SOCIETY AGAIN HIGHBURY THE LARGE AND POPULOUS VILLAGE ALMOST AMOUNTING TO A TOWN
30-4445-0019 SHE HAD MANY ACQUAINTANCE IN THE PLACE FOR HER FATHER WAS UNIVERSALLY CIVIL BUT NOT ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD BE ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF MISS TAYLOR FOR EVEN HALF A DAY IT WAS A MELANCHOLY CHANGE AND EMMA COULD NOT BUT SIGH OVER IT AND WISH FOR IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
30-4445-0020 TILL HER FATHER AWOKE AND MADE IT NECESSARY TO BE CHEERFUL HIS SPIRITS REQUIRED SUPPORT HE WAS A NERVOUS MAN EASILY DEPRESSED FOND OF EVERY BODY THAT HE WAS USED TO AND HATING TO PART WITH THEM
30-4445-0021 HATING CHANGE OF EVERY KIND MATRIMONY AS THE ORIGIN OF CHANGE WAS ALWAYS DISAGREEABLE AND HE WAS BY NO MEANS YET RECONCILED TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER'S MARRYING
30-4445-0022 THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ENTIRELY A MATCH OF AFFECTION WHEN HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PART WITH MISS TAYLOR TOO AND FROM HIS HABITS OF GENTLE SELFISHNESS AND OF BEING NEVER ABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY FROM HIMSELF
30-4445-0023 HE WAS VERY MUCH DISPOSED TO THINK MISS TAYLOR HAD DONE AS SAD A THING FOR HERSELF AS FOR THEM AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL HAPPIER IF SHE HAD SPENT ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE AT HARTFIELD EMMA SMILED AND CHATTED AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD TO KEEP HIM FROM SUCH THOUGHTS
30-4445-0024 BUT WHEN TEA CAME IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM NOT TO SAY EXACTLY AS HE HAD SAID AT DINNER POOR MISS TAYLOR I WISH SHE WERE HERE AGAIN WHAT A PITY IT IS THAT MISTER WESTON EVER THOUGHT OF HER I CANNOT AGREE WITH YOU PAPA
30-4445-0025 YOU KNOW I CANNOT MISTER WESTON IS SUCH A GOOD HUMOURED PLEASANT EXCELLENT MAN THAT HE THOROUGHLY DESERVES A GOOD WIFE AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MISS TAYLOR LIVE WITH US FOR EVER AND BEAR ALL MY ODD HUMOURS WHEN SHE MIGHT HAVE A HOUSE OF HER OWN A HOUSE OF HER OWN
30-4445-0026 BUT WHERE IS THE ADVANTAGE OF A HOUSE OF HER OWN THIS IS THREE TIMES AS LARGE AND YOU HAVE NEVER ANY ODD HUMOURS MY DEAR HOW OFTEN WE SHALL BE GOING TO SEE THEM AND THEY COMING TO SEE US WE SHALL BE ALWAYS MEETING WE MUST BEGIN

30-4445-0031 AND I AM SURE SHE WILL MAKE A VERY GOOD SERVANT SHE IS A CIVIL PRETTY SPOKEN GIRL I HAVE A GREAT OPINION OF HER WHENEVER I SEE HER SHE ALWAYS CURTSEYS AND ASKS ME HOW I DO IN A VERY PRETTY MANNER
30-4445-0032 I OBSERVE SHE ALWAYS TURNS THE LOCK OF THE DOOR THE RIGHT WAY AND NEVER BANGS IT I AM SURE SHE WILL BE AN EXCELLENT SERVANT AND IT WILL BE A GREAT COMFORT TO POOR MISS TAYLOR TO HAVE SOMEBODY ABOUT HER THAT SHE IS USED TO SEE WHENEVER JAMES GOES OVER TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER YOU KNOW SHE WILL BE HEARING OF US
30-4445-0033 HE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL HER HOW WE ALL ARE EMMA SPARED NO EXERTIONS TO MAINTAIN THIS HAPPIER FLOW OF IDEAS AND HOPED BY THE HELP OF BACKGAMMON TO GET HER FATHER TOLERABLY THROUGH THE EVENING AND BE ATTACKED BY NO REGRETS BUT HER OWN
30-4445-0034 THE BACKGAMMON TABLE WAS PLACED BUT A VISITOR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS WALKED IN AND MADE IT UNNECESSARY MISTER KNIGHTLEY A SENSIBLE MAN ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT AND THIRTY WAS NOT ONLY A VERY OLD AND INTIMATE FRIEND OF THE FAMILY
30-4445-0035 HE HAD RETURNED TO A LATE DINNER AFTER SOME DAYS ABSENCE
30-4445-0036 AND ANIMATED MISTER WOODHOUSE FOR SOME TIME MISTER KNIGHTLEY HAD A CHEERFUL MANNER WHICH ALWAYS DID HIM GOOD AND HIS MANY INQUIRIES AFTER POOR ISABELLA AND HER CHILDREN WERE ANSWERED MOST SATISFACTORILY WHEN THIS WAS OVER MISTER WOODHOUSE GRATEFULLY OBSERVED
30-4445-0037 NOT AT ALL SIR IT IS A BEAUTIFUL MOONLIGHT NIGHT AND SO MILD THAT I MUST DRAW BACK FROM YOUR GREAT FIRE BUT YOU MUST HAVE FOUND IT VERY DAMP AND DIRTY I WISH YOU MAY NOT CATCH COLD

30-4445-0041 BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUESTION OF DEPENDENCE OR INDEPENDENCE AT ANY RATE IT MUST BE BETTER TO HAVE ONLY ONE TO PLEASE THAN TWO ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE OF THOSE TWO IS SUCH A FANCIFUL TROUBLESOME CREATURE SAID EMMA PLAYFULLY
30-4445-0042 THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD I KNOW AND WHAT YOU WOULD CERTAINLY SAY IF MY FATHER WERE NOT BY I BELIEVE IT IS VERY TRUE MY DEAR INDEED SAID MISTER WOODHOUSE WITH A SIGH I AM AFRAID I AM SOMETIMES VERY FANCIFUL AND TROUBLESOME
30-4445-0043 MY DEAREST PAPA YOU DO NOT THINK I COULD MEAN YOU OR SUPPOSE MISTER KNIGHTLEY TO MEAN YOU WHAT A HORRIBLE IDEA OH NO I MEANT ONLY MYSELF MISTER KNIGHTLEY LOVES TO FIND FAULT WITH ME YOU KNOW IN A JOKE IT IS ALL A JOKE
30-4445-0044 SHE KNEW IT WOULD BE SO MUCH LESS SO TO HER FATHER THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HIM REALLY SUSPECT SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE AS HER NOT BEING THOUGHT PERFECT BY EVERY BODY EMMA KNOWS I NEVER FLATTER HER SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY
30-4445-0045 BUT I MEANT NO REFLECTION ON ANY BODY MISS TAYLOR HAS BEEN USED TO HAVE TWO PERSONS TO PLEASE SHE WILL NOW HAVE BUT ONE THE CHANCES ARE THAT SHE MUST BE A GAINER WELL SAID EMMA WILLING TO LET IT PASS
30-4445-0046 YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE WEDDING AND I SHALL BE HAPPY TO TELL YOU FOR WE ALL BEHAVED CHARMINGLY EVERY BODY WAS PUNCTUAL EVERY BODY IN THEIR BEST LOOKS NOT A TEAR AND HARDLY A LONG FACE TO BE SEEN
30-4445-0047 OH NO WE ALL FELT THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE ONLY HALF A MILE APART AND WERE SURE OF MEETING EVERY DAY DEAR EMMA BEARS EVERY THING SO WELL SAID HER FATHER BUT MISTER KNIGHTLEY SHE IS REALLY VERY SORRY TO LOSE POOR MISS TAYLOR
30-4445-0048 AND I AM SURE SHE WILL MISS HER MORE THAN SHE THINKS FOR EMMA TURNED AWAY HER HEAD DIVIDED BETWEEN TEARS AND SMILES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT EMMA SHOULD NOT MISS SUCH A COMPANION SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY
30-4445-0049 WE SHOULD NOT LIKE HER SO WELL AS WE DO SIR IF WE COULD SUPPOSE IT BUT SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH THE MARRIAGE IS TO MISS TAYLOR'S ADVANTAGE SHE KNOWS HOW VERY ACCEPTABLE IT MUST BE AT MISS TAYLOR'S TIME OF LIFE TO BE SETTLED IN A HOME OF HER OWN
30-4445-0050 AND THEREFORE CANNOT ALLOW HERSELF TO FEEL SO MUCH PAIN AS PLEASURE EVERY FRIEND OF MISS TAYLOR MUST BE GLAD TO HAVE HER SO HAPPILY MARRIED
30-4445-0051 AND A VERY CONSIDERABLE ONE THAT I MADE THE MATCH MYSELF I MADE THE MATCH YOU KNOW FOUR YEARS AGO
30-4445-0052 WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE SAID MISTER WESTON WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN MAY COMFORT ME FOR ANY THING MISTER KNIGHTLEY SHOOK HIS HEAD AT HER HER FATHER FONDLY REPLIED AH MY DEAR I WISH YOU WOULD NOT MAKE MATCHES AND FORETELL THINGS
30-4445-0053 FOR WHATEVER YOU SAY ALWAYS COMES TO PASS PRAY DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE MATCHES I PROMISE YOU TO MAKE NONE FOR MYSELF PAPA BUT I MUST INDEED FOR OTHER PEOPLE IT IS THE GREATEST AMUSEMENT IN THE WORLD AND AFTER SUCH SUCCESS YOU KNOW
30-4445-0054 EVERY BODY SAID THAT MISTER WESTON WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN OH DEAR NO MISTER WESTON WHO HAD BEEN A WIDOWER SO LONG
30-4445-0055 SO CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED EITHER IN HIS BUSINESS IN TOWN OR AMONG HIS FRIENDS HERE ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE WHEREVER HE WENT ALWAYS CHEERFUL MISTER WESTON NEED NOT SPEND A SINGLE EVENING IN THE YEAR ALONE IF HE DID NOT LIKE IT
30-4445-0056 OH NO MISTER WESTON CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN SOME PEOPLE EVEN TALKED OF A PROMISE TO HIS WIFE ON HER DEATHBED AND OTHERS OF THE SON AND THE UNCLE NOT LETTING HIM ALL MANNER OF SOLEMN NONSENSE WAS TALKED ON THE SUBJECT BUT I BELIEVED NONE OF IT
30-4445-0057 EVER SINCE THE DAY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO THAT MISS TAYLOR AND I MET WITH HIM IN BROADWAY LANE WHEN BECAUSE IT BEGAN TO DRIZZLE HE DARTED AWAY WITH SO MUCH GALLANTRY AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT
30-4445-0058 I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE DEAR PAPA YOU CANNOT THINK THAT I SHALL LEAVE OFF MATCH MAKING I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BY SUCCESS SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY
30-4445-0059 SUCCESS SUPPOSES ENDEAVOUR YOUR TIME HAS BEEN PROPERLY AND DELICATELY SPENT IF YOU HAVE BEEN ENDEAVOURING FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS TO BRING ABOUT THIS MARRIAGE A WORTHY EMPLOYMENT FOR A YOUNG LADY'S MIND
30-4445-0060 WHERE IS YOUR MERIT WHAT ARE YOU PROUD OF YOU MADE A LUCKY GUESS AND THAT IS ALL THAT CAN BE SAID AND HAVE YOU NEVER KNOWN THE PLEASURE AND TRIUMPH OF A LUCKY GUESS I PITY YOU I THOUGHT YOU CLEVERER
30-4445-0061 FOR DEPEND UPON IT A LUCKY GUESS IS NEVER MERELY LUCK THERE IS ALWAYS SOME TALENT IN IT AND AS TO MY POOR WORD SUCCESS WHICH YOU QUARREL WITH I DO NOT KNOW THAT I AM SO ENTIRELY WITHOUT ANY CLAIM TO IT YOU HAVE DRAWN TWO PRETTY PICTURES
30-4445-0062 BUT I THINK THERE MAY BE A THIRD A SOMETHING BETWEEN THE DO NOTHING AND THE DO ALL IF I HAD NOT PROMOTED MISTER WESTON'S VISITS HERE AND GIVEN MANY LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENTS AND SMOOTHED MANY LITTLE MATTERS IT MIGHT NOT HAVE COME TO ANY THING AFTER ALL
30-4445-0063 I THINK YOU MUST KNOW HARTFIELD ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND THAT A STRAIGHTFORWARD OPEN HEARTED MAN LIKE WESTON AND A RATIONAL UNAFFECTED WOMAN LIKE MISS TAYLOR MAY BE SAFELY LEFT TO MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS
30-4445-0064 EMMA NEVER THINKS OF HERSELF IF SHE CAN DO GOOD TO OTHERS REJOINED MISTER WOODHOUSE UNDERSTANDING BUT IN PART
30-4445-0065 ONLY ONE MORE PAPA ONLY FOR MISTER ELTON POOR MISTER ELTON YOU LIKE MISTER ELTON PAPA I MUST LOOK ABOUT FOR A WIFE FOR HIM THERE IS NOBODY IN HIGHBURY WHO DESERVES HIM
30-4445-0066 AND HE HAS BEEN HERE A WHOLE YEAR AND HAS FITTED UP HIS HOUSE SO COMFORTABLY THAT IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO HAVE HIM SINGLE ANY LONGER AND I THOUGHT WHEN HE WAS JOINING THEIR HANDS TO DAY HE LOOKED SO VERY MUCH AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OFFICE DONE FOR HIM
30-4445-0067 I THINK VERY WELL OF MISTER ELTON AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I HAVE OF DOING HIM A SERVICE MISTER ELTON IS A VERY PRETTY YOUNG MAN TO BE SURE AND A VERY GOOD YOUNG MAN AND I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM
30-4445-0068 ASK HIM TO COME AND DINE WITH US SOME DAY THAT WILL BE A MUCH BETTER THING I DARE SAY MISTER KNIGHTLEY WILL BE SO KIND AS TO MEET HIM WITH A GREAT DEAL OF PLEASURE SIR AT ANY TIME SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY LAUGHING
30-4445-0069 AND I AGREE WITH YOU ENTIRELY THAT IT WILL BE A MUCH BETTER THING INVITE HIM TO DINNER EMMA AND HELP HIM TO THE BEST OF THE FISH AND THE CHICKEN
