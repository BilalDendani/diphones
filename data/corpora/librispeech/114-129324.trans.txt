114-129324-0000 AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES LIKE MISFORTUNES SELDOM COME ALONE HER SITUATION WAS INDEED ONE OF NO COMMON TRIAL AND DIFFICULTY
114-129324-0001 HER WORDS AND MANNER HAD TOUCHED ROSE MAYLIE'S HEART AND MINGLED WITH HER LOVE FOR HER YOUNG CHARGE AND SCARCELY LESS INTENSE IN ITS TRUTH AND FERVOUR WAS HER FOND WISH TO WIN THE OUTCAST BACK TO REPENTANCE AND HOPE
114-129324-0002 THEY PURPOSED REMAINING IN LONDON ONLY THREE DAYS PRIOR TO DEPARTING FOR SOME WEEKS TO A DISTANT PART OF THE COAST IT WAS NOW MIDNIGHT OF THE FIRST DAY WHAT COURSE OF ACTION COULD SHE DETERMINE UPON WHICH COULD BE ADOPTED IN EIGHT AND FORTY HOURS
114-129324-0003 OR HOW COULD SHE POSTPONE THE JOURNEY WITHOUT EXCITING SUSPICION MISTER LOSBERNE WAS WITH THEM AND WOULD BE FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS BUT ROSE WAS TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE EXCELLENT GENTLEMAN'S IMPETUOSITY AND FORESAW TOO CLEARLY THE WRATH WITH WHICH
114-129324-0004 IN THE FIRST EXPLOSION OF HIS INDIGNATION HE WOULD REGARD THE INSTRUMENT OF OLIVER'S RECAPTURE TO TRUST HIM WITH THE SECRET WHEN HER REPRESENTATIONS IN THE GIRL'S BEHALF COULD BE SECONDED BY NO EXPERIENCED PERSON
114-129324-0005 THESE WERE ALL REASONS FOR THE GREATEST CAUTION AND MOST CIRCUMSPECT BEHAVIOUR IN COMMUNICATING IT TO MISSUS MAYLIE WHOSE FIRST IMPULSE WOULD INFALLIBLY BE TO HOLD A CONFERENCE WITH THE WORTHY DOCTOR ON THE SUBJECT AS TO RESORTING TO ANY LEGAL ADVISER
114-129324-0006 EVEN IF SHE HAD KNOWN HOW TO DO SO IT WAS SCARCELY TO BE THOUGHT OF FOR THE SAME REASON ONCE THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HER OF SEEKING ASSISTANCE FROM HARRY BUT THIS AWAKENED THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR LAST PARTING AND IT SEEMED UNWORTHY OF HER TO CALL HIM BACK WHEN
114-129324-0007 THE TEARS ROSE TO HER EYES AS SHE PURSUED THIS TRAIN OF REFLECTION HE MIGHT HAVE BY THIS TIME LEARNT TO FORGET HER AND TO BE HAPPIER AWAY DISTURBED BY THESE DIFFERENT REFLECTIONS INCLINING NOW TO ONE COURSE AND THEN TO ANOTHER
114-129324-0008 AND AGAIN RECOILING FROM ALL AS EACH SUCCESSIVE CONSIDERATION PRESENTED ITSELF TO HER MIND ROSE PASSED A SLEEPLESS AND ANXIOUS NIGHT AFTER MORE COMMUNING WITH HERSELF NEXT DAY SHE ARRIVED AT THE DESPERATE CONCLUSION OF CONSULTING HARRY
114-129324-0009 IF IT BE PAINFUL TO HIM SHE THOUGHT TO COME BACK HERE HOW PAINFUL IT WILL BE TO ME BUT PERHAPS HE WILL NOT COME HE MAY WRITE OR HE MAY COME HIMSELF AND STUDIOUSLY ABSTAIN FROM MEETING ME HE DID WHEN HE WENT AWAY
114-129324-0010 AND LAID IT DOWN AGAIN FIFTY TIMES AND HAD CONSIDERED AND RECONSIDERED THE FIRST LINE OF HER LETTER WITHOUT WRITING THE FIRST WORD WHEN OLIVER WHO HAD BEEN WALKING IN THE STREETS WITH MISTER GILES FOR A BODY GUARD ENTERED THE ROOM IN SUCH BREATHLESS HASTE AND VIOLENT AGITATION
114-129324-0011 BUT WHAT IS THIS OF WHOM DO YOU SPEAK I HAVE SEEN THE GENTLEMAN REPLIED OLIVER SCARCELY ABLE TO ARTICULATE THE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS SO GOOD TO ME MISTER BROWNLOW THAT WE HAVE SO OFTEN TALKED ABOUT WHERE ASKED ROSE
114-129324-0012 GETTING OUT OF A COACH REPLIED OLIVER SHEDDING TEARS OF DELIGHT AND GOING INTO A HOUSE I DIDN'T SPEAK TO HIM I COULDN'T SPEAK TO HIM FOR HE DIDN'T SEE ME AND I TREMBLED SO THAT I WAS NOT ABLE TO GO UP TO HIM BUT GILES ASKED FOR ME
114-129324-0013 WHETHER HE LIVED THERE AND THEY SAID HE DID LOOK HERE SAID OLIVER OPENING A SCRAP OF PAPER HERE IT IS HERE'S WHERE HE LIVES I'M GOING THERE DIRECTLY OH DEAR ME DEAR ME WHAT SHALL I DO WHEN I COME TO SEE HIM AND
114-129324-0014 WITH HER ATTENTION NOT A LITTLE DISTRACTED BY THESE AND A GREAT MANY OTHER INCOHERENT EXCLAMATIONS OF JOY ROSE READ THE ADDRESS WHICH WAS CRAVEN STREET IN THE STRAND SHE VERY SOON DETERMINED UPON TURNING THE DISCOVERY TO ACCOUNT
114-129324-0015 QUICK SHE SAID TELL THEM TO FETCH A HACKNEY COACH AND BE READY TO GO WITH ME I WILL TAKE YOU THERE DIRECTLY WITHOUT A MINUTE'S LOSS OF TIME I WILL ONLY TELL MY AUNT THAT WE ARE GOING OUT FOR AN HOUR AND BE READY AS SOON AS YOU ARE
114-129324-0016 OLIVER NEEDED NO PROMPTING TO DESPATCH AND IN LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO CRAVEN STREET WHEN THEY ARRIVED THERE ROSE LEFT OLIVER IN THE COACH UNDER PRETENCE OF PREPARING THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO RECEIVE HIM
114-129324-0017 AND SENDING UP HER CARD BY THE SERVANT REQUESTED TO SEE MISTER BROWNLOW ON VERY PRESSING BUSINESS THE SERVANT SOON RETURNED TO BEG THAT SHE WOULD WALK UPSTAIRS AND FOLLOWING HIM INTO AN UPPER ROOM MISS MAYLIE WAS PRESENTED TO AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN OF BENEVOLENT APPEARANCE
114-129324-0018 DEAR ME SAID THE GENTLEMAN IN THE BOTTLE GREEN COAT HASTILY RISING WITH GREAT POLITENESS I BEG YOUR PARDON YOUNG LADY I IMAGINED IT WAS SOME IMPORTUNATE PERSON WHO I BEG YOU WILL EXCUSE ME
114-129324-0019 BE SEATED PRAY MISTER BROWNLOW I BELIEVE SIR SAID ROSE GLANCING FROM THE OTHER GENTLEMAN TO THE ONE WHO HAD SPOKEN THAT IS MY NAME SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN THIS IS MY FRIEND MISTER GRIMWIG
114-129324-0020 GRIMWIG WILL YOU LEAVE US FOR A FEW MINUTES I BELIEVE INTERPOSED MISS MAYLIE THAT AT THIS PERIOD OF OUR INTERVIEW I NEED NOT GIVE THAT GENTLEMAN THE TROUBLE OF GOING AWAY IF I AM CORRECTLY INFORMED
114-129324-0021 HE IS COGNIZANT OF THE BUSINESS ON WHICH I WISH TO SPEAK TO YOU MISTER BROWNLOW INCLINED HIS HEAD MISTER GRIMWIG WHO HAD MADE ONE VERY STIFF BOW AND RISEN FROM HIS CHAIR MADE ANOTHER VERY STIFF BOW AND DROPPED INTO IT AGAIN
114-129324-0022 I SHALL SURPRISE YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE NO DOUBT SAID ROSE NATURALLY EMBARRASSED BUT YOU ONCE SHOWED GREAT BENEVOLENCE AND GOODNESS TO A VERY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND OF MINE AND I AM SURE YOU WILL TAKE AN INTEREST IN HEARING OF HIM AGAIN
114-129324-0023 INDEED SAID MISTER BROWNLOW OLIVER TWIST YOU KNEW HIM AS REPLIED ROSE THE WORDS NO SOONER ESCAPED HER LIPS
114-129324-0024 UPSET IT WITH A GREAT CRASH AND FALLING BACK IN HIS CHAIR DISCHARGED FROM HIS FEATURES EVERY EXPRESSION BUT ONE OF UNMITIGATED WONDER AND INDULGED IN A PROLONGED AND VACANT STARE THEN AS IF ASHAMED OF HAVING BETRAYED SO MUCH EMOTION
114-129324-0025 HE JERKED HIMSELF AS IT WERE BY A CONVULSION INTO HIS FORMER ATTITUDE AND LOOKING OUT STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM EMITTED A LONG DEEP WHISTLE WHICH SEEMED AT LAST
114-129324-0026 NOT TO BE DISCHARGED ON EMPTY AIR BUT TO DIE AWAY IN THE INNERMOST RECESSES OF HIS STOMACH MISTER BROWLOW WAS NO LESS SURPRISED ALTHOUGH HIS ASTONISHMENT WAS NOT EXPRESSED IN THE SAME ECCENTRIC MANNER HE DREW HIS CHAIR NEARER TO MISS MAYLIE'S AND SAID
114-129324-0027 DO ME THE FAVOUR MY DEAR YOUNG LADY TO LEAVE ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT GOODNESS AND BENEVOLENCE OF WHICH YOU SPEAK AND OF WHICH NOBODY ELSE KNOWS ANYTHING
114-129324-0028 AND IF YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR POWER TO PRODUCE ANY EVIDENCE WHICH WILL ALTER THE UNFAVOURABLE OPINION I WAS ONCE INDUCED TO ENTERTAIN OF THAT POOR CHILD IN HEAVEN'S NAME PUT ME IN POSSESSION OF IT A BAD ONE I'LL EAT MY HEAD IF HE IS NOT A BAD ONE
114-129324-0029 AND HE'D UNCOMMONLY LIKE TO SEE ANY MAN OFFER TO DO IT RESPONDED MISTER GRIMWIG KNOCKING HIS STICK UPON THE FLOOR HAVING GONE THUS FAR THE TWO OLD GENTLEMEN SEVERALLY TOOK SNUFF
114-129324-0030 AND AFTERWARDS SHOOK HANDS ACCORDING TO THEIR INVARIABLE CUSTOM NOW MISS MAYLIE SAID MISTER BROWNLOW TO RETURN TO THE SUBJECT IN WHICH YOUR HUMANITY IS SO MUCH INTERESTED
114-129324-0031 WILL YOU LET ME KNOW WHAT INTELLIGENCE YOU HAVE OF THIS POOR CHILD ALLOWING ME TO PROMISE THAT I EXHAUSTED EVERY MEANS IN MY POWER OF DISCOVERING HIM AND THAT SINCE I HAVE BEEN ABSENT FROM THIS COUNTRY MY FIRST IMPRESSION THAT HE HAD IMPOSED UPON ME
114-129324-0032 RESERVING NANCY'S INFORMATION FOR THAT GENTLEMAN'S PRIVATE EAR AND CONCLUDING WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT HIS ONLY SORROW FOR SOME MONTHS PAST HAD BEEN NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET WITH HIS FORMER BENEFACTOR AND FRIEND THANK GOD SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN
114-129324-0033 THIS IS GREAT HAPPINESS TO ME GREAT HAPPINESS BUT YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME WHERE HE IS NOW MISS MAYLIE YOU MUST PARDON MY FINDING FAULT WITH YOU
114-129324-0034 HE IS WAITING IN A COACH AT THE DOOR REPLIED ROSE AT THIS DOOR CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH WHICH HE HURRIED OUT OF THE ROOM DOWN THE STAIRS UP THE COACHSTEPS AND INTO THE COACH WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD
114-129324-0035 WHEN THE ROOM DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM MISTER GRIMWIG LIFTED UP HIS HEAD AND CONVERTING ONE OF THE HIND LEGS OF HIS CHAIR INTO A PIVOT DESCRIBED THREE DISTINCT CIRCLES WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS STICK AND THE TABLE SITTING IN IT ALL THE TIME AFTER PERFORMING THIS EVOLUTION
114-129324-0036 HE ROSE AND LIMPED AS FAST AS HE COULD UP AND DOWN THE ROOM AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES AND THEN STOPPING SUDDENLY BEFORE ROSE KISSED HER WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST PREFACE HUSH HE SAID AS THE YOUNG LADY ROSE IN SOME ALARM AT THIS UNUSUAL PROCEEDING
114-129324-0037 DON'T BE AFRAID I'M OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR GRANDFATHER YOU'RE A SWEET GIRL I LIKE YOU HERE THEY ARE IN FACT AS HE THREW HIMSELF AT ONE DEXTEROUS DIVE INTO HIS FORMER SEAT MISTER BROWNLOW RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY OLIVER
114-129324-0038 SAID MISTER BROWNLOW RINGING THE BELL SEND MISSUS BEDWIN HERE IF YOU PLEASE THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER ANSWERED THE SUMMONS WITH ALL DISPATCH AND DROPPING A CURTSEY AT THE DOOR WAITED FOR ORDERS WHY YOU GET BLINDER EVERY DAY BEDWIN
114-129324-0039 SAID MISTER BROWNLOW RATHER TESTILY WELL THAT I DO SIR REPLIED THE OLD LADY PEOPLE'S EYES AT MY TIME OF LIFE DON'T IMPROVE WITH AGE SIR I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT REJOINED MISTER BROWNLOW
114-129324-0040 GOD BE GOOD TO ME CRIED THE OLD LADY EMBRACING HIM IT IS MY INNOCENT BOY MY DEAR OLD NURSE CRIED OLIVER HE WOULD COME BACK I KNEW HE WOULD SAID THE OLD LADY HOLDING HIM IN HER ARMS HOW WELL HE LOOKS
114-129324-0041 THE GOOD SOUL LAUGHED AND WEPT UPON HIS NECK BY TURNS LEAVING HER AND OLIVER TO COMPARE NOTES AT LEISURE MISTER BROWNLOW LED THE WAY INTO ANOTHER ROOM AND THERE HEARD FROM ROSE A FULL NARRATION OF HER INTERVIEW WITH NANCY
114-129324-0042 WHICH OCCASIONED HIM NO LITTLE SURPRISE AND PERPLEXITY ROSE ALSO EXPLAINED HER REASONS FOR NOT CONFIDING IN HER FRIEND MISTER LOSBERNE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE OLD GENTLEMAN CONSIDERED THAT SHE HAD ACTED PRUDENTLY
114-129324-0043 AND READILY UNDERTOOK TO HOLD SOLEMN CONFERENCE WITH THE WORTHY DOCTOR HIMSELF TO AFFORD HIM AN EARLY OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXECUTION OF THIS DESIGN IT WAS ARRANGED THAT HE SHOULD CALL AT THE HOTEL AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THAT EVENING AND THAT IN THE MEANTIME
114-129324-0044 MISSUS MAYLIE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUSLY INFORMED OF ALL THAT HAD OCCURRED THESE PRELIMINARIES ADJUSTED ROSE AND OLIVER RETURNED HOME ROSE HAD BY NO MEANS OVERRATED THE MEASURE OF THE GOOD DOCTOR'S WRATH NANCY'S HISTORY WAS NO SOONER UNFOLDED TO HIM
114-129324-0045 THAN HE POURED FORTH A SHOWER OF MINGLED THREATS AND EXECRATIONS THREATENED TO MAKE HER THE FIRST VICTIM OF THE COMBINED INGENUITY OF MESSRS BLATHERS AND DUFF AND ACTUALLY PUT ON HIS HAT PREPARATORY TO SALLYING FORTH TO OBTAIN THE ASSISTANCE OF THOSE WORTHIES
114-129324-0046 AND DOUBTLESS HE WOULD IN THIS FIRST OUTBREAK HAVE CARRIED THE INTENTION INTO EFFECT WITHOUT A MOMENT'S CONSIDERATION OF THE CONSEQUENCES IF HE HAD NOT BEEN RESTRAINED IN PART BY CORRESPONDING VIOLENCE ON THE SIDE OF MISTER BROWNLOW
114-129324-0047 SAID THE IMPETUOUS DOCTOR WHEN THEY HAD REJOINED THE TWO LADIES ARE WE TO PASS A VOTE OF THANKS TO ALL THESE VAGABONDS MALE AND FEMALE AND BEG THEM TO ACCEPT A HUNDRED POUNDS OR SO APIECE AS A TRIFLING MARK OF OUR ESTEEM
114-129324-0048 AND SOME SLIGHT ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THEIR KINDNESS TO OLIVER NOT EXACTLY THAT REJOINED MISTER BROWNLOW LAUGHING BUT WE MUST PROCEED GENTLY AND WITH GREAT CARE GENTLENESS AND CARE EXCLAIMED THE DOCTOR
114-129324-0049 I'D SEND THEM ONE AND ALL TO NEVER MIND WHERE INTERPOSED MISTER BROWNLOW BUT REFLECT WHETHER SENDING THEM ANYWHERE IS LIKELY TO ATTAIN THE OBJECT WE HAVE IN VIEW WHAT OBJECT ASKED THE DOCTOR
114-129324-0050 WHAT GOOD SHOULD WE BRING ABOUT HANGING A FEW OF THEM AT LEAST IN ALL PROBABILITY SUGGESTED THE DOCTOR AND TRANSPORTING THE REST VERY GOOD REPLIED MISTER BROWNLOW SMILING
114-129324-0051 THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY STRATAGEM AND BY CATCHING HIM WHEN HE IS NOT SURROUNDED BY THESE PEOPLE FOR SUPPOSE HE WERE APPREHENDED WE HAVE NO PROOF AGAINST HIM HE IS NOT EVEN SO FAR AS WE KNOW OR AS THE FACTS APPEAR TO US
114-129324-0052 CONCERNED WITH THE GANG IN ANY OF THEIR ROBBERIES IF HE WERE NOT DISCHARGED IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT HE COULD RECEIVE ANY FURTHER PUNISHMENT THAN BEING COMMITTED TO PRISON AS A ROGUE AND VAGABOND
114-129324-0053 WHETHER YOU THINK IT REASONABLE THAT THIS PROMISE TO THE GIRL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BINDING A PROMISE MADE WITH THE BEST AND KINDEST INTENTIONS BUT REALLY DO NOT DISCUSS THE POINT MY DEAR YOUNG LADY PRAY SAID MISTER BROWNLOW INTERRUPTING ROSE AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK
114-129324-0054 HE WAS FAIN TO ADMIT THAT NO BETTER COURSE OCCURRED TO HIM JUST THEN AND AS BOTH ROSE AND MISSUS MAYLIE SIDED VERY STRONGLY WITH MISTER BROWNLOW THAT GENTLEMAN'S PROPOSITION WAS CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY I SHOULD LIKE HE SAID
114-129324-0055 TO CALL IN THE AID OF MY FRIEND GRIMWIG HE IS A STRANGE CREATURE BUT A SHREWD ONE AND MIGHT PROVE OF MATERIAL ASSISTANCE TO US I SHOULD SAY THAT HE WAS BRED A LAWYER AND QUITTED THE BAR IN DISGUST BECAUSE HE HAD ONLY ONE BRIEF AND A MOTION OF COURSE
114-129324-0056 WHO MAY HE BE THAT LADY'S SON AND THIS YOUNG LADY'S VERY OLD FRIEND SAID THE DOCTOR MOTIONING TOWARDS MISSUS MAYLIE AND CONCLUDING WITH AN EXPRESSIVE GLANCE AT HER NIECE
114-129324-0057 WILL HAVE BEGUN TO THINK BY THIS TIME THAT WE HAVE WEARIED OF HIS COMPANY AND ENTERED INTO SOME DARK CONSPIRACY TO THRUST HIM FORTH UPON THE WORLD
