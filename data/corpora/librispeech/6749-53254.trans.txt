6749-53254-0000 THE STREETS OF THE BURG OF THE FOUR FRITHS HE WENT ABOUT THE STREETS AND FOUND THEM ALL MUCH LIKE TO THE ONE WHICH THEY HAD ENTERED BY THE NORTH GATE HE SAW NO POOR OR WRETCHED HOUSES
6749-53254-0001 AND NONE VERY BIG AS OF GREAT LORDS THEY WERE WELL AND STOUTLY BUILDED
6749-53254-0002 THERE WERE FOLK ENOUGH IN THE STREETS AND NOW RALPH AS WAS LIKE TO BE LOOKED SPECIALLY AT THE WOMEN AND THOUGHT MANY OF THEM LITTLE BETTER FAVOURED THAN THE MEN BEING BOTH DARK AND LOW NEITHER WERE THEY GAILY CLAD
6749-53254-0003 THOUGH THEIR RAIMENT LIKE THE HOUSES WAS STOUT AND WELL WROUGHT BUT HERE AND THERE HE CAME ON A WOMAN TALLER AND WHITER THAN THE OTHERS AS THOUGH SHE WERE OF ANOTHER BLOOD ALL SUCH OF THESE
6749-53254-0004 AS HE SAW WERE CLAD OTHERWISE THAN THE DARKER WOMEN THEIR HEADS UNCOIFED UNCOVERED SAVE FOR SOME GARLAND OR SILKEN BAND THEIR GOWNS YELLOW LIKE WHEAT STRAW BUT GAILY EMBROIDERED SLEEVELESS WITHAL AND SHORT
6749-53254-0005 TWISTED ABOUT THEIR HEADS THESE HE TOOK FOR MERCHANTS AS THEY WERE OFTENEST STANDING IN AND ABOUT THE BOOTHS AND SHOPS WHEREOF
6749-53254-0006 WHICH WAS THE FISH AND FOWL MARKET HE CAME INTO A LONG STREET THAT LED HIM DOWN TO A GATE RIGHT OVER AGAINST THAT WHEREBY HE HAD ENTERED THE BURG
6749-53254-0007 HE SAW THAT THERE WAS A WIDE WAY CLEAR OF ALL HOUSES INSIDE OF THE WALL SO THAT MEN AT ARMS MIGHT GO FREELY FROM ONE PART TO THE OTHER AND HE HAD ALSO NOTED THAT A WIDE WAY LED FROM EACH PORT OUT OF THE GREAT PLACE
6749-53254-0008 AND EACH ENDED NOT BUT IN A GATE BUT AS TO ANY CASTLE IN THE TOWN HE SAW NONE AND WHEN HE ASKED A BURGHER THEREOF
6749-53254-0009 AND THAT IT WOULD TURN OUT TO BE NONE OF THE EASIEST TO WIN AND FORSOOTH RALPH HIMSELF WAS MUCH OF THAT MIND NOW HE WAS JUST WITHIN THE SOUTH GATE WHEN HE HELD THIS TALK AND THERE WERE MANY FOLK THEREBY ALREADY
6749-53254-0010 SO HE STOOD THERE TO SEE WHAT SHOULD BETIDE AND ANON HE HEARD GREAT BLOWING OF HORNS AND TRUMPETS ALL ALONG THE WALL AND AS HE DEEMED OTHER HORNS ANSWERED FROM WITHOUT AND SO IT WAS FOR SOON
6749-53254-0011 FOOT MEN WITH BILLS SOME AND SOME WITH BOWS AND ALL ARMED KNIGHTS AND SERGEANTS A HORSEBACK SO STREAMED IN THESE WEAPONED MEN TILL RALPH SAW THAT IT WAS A GREAT HOST THAT WAS ENTERING THE BURG AND HIS HEART ROSE WITHIN HIM
6749-53254-0012 AFTER A WHILE AMONG THE WARRIORS CAME HERDS OF NEAT AND FLOCKS OF SHEEP AND STRINGS OF HORSES OF THE SPOIL WHICH THE HOST HAD LIFTED AND THEN WAINS FILLED SOME WITH WEAPONS AND WAR GEAR
6749-53254-0013 AND SOME WITH BALES OF GOODS AND HOUSEHOLD STUFF
6749-53254-0014 SOME GOING AFOOT AND SOME FOR WEARINESS BORNE IN WAINS FOR ALL THESE WAR TAKEN THRALLS WERE WOMEN AND WOMEN CHILDREN OF MALES THERE WAS NOT SO MUCH AS A LITTLE LAD OF THE WOMEN
6749-53254-0015 MANY SEEMED FAIR TO RALPH DESPITE THEIR GRIEF AND TRAVEL AND AS HE LOOKED ON THEM HE DEEMED THAT THEY MUST BE OF THE KINDRED AND NATION OF THE FAIR WHITE WOMEN HE HAD SEEN IN THE STREETS THOUGH THEY WERE NOT CLAD LIKE THOSE BUT DIVERSELY
6749-53254-0016 AND HE WAS WEARY WITH THE HEAT AND THE DUST AND THE CONFUSED CLAMOUR OF SHOUTING AND LAUGHTER AND TALKING AND WHEREAS MOST OF THE FOLK FOLLOWED AFTER THE HOST AND THEIR SPOIL THE STREETS OF THE TOWN THERE ABOUT WERE SOON LEFT EMPTY AND PEACEFUL
6749-53254-0017 SO HE TURNED INTO A STREET NARROWER THAN MOST THAT WENT EAST FROM THE SOUTH GATE AND WAS MUCH SHADED FROM THE AFTERNOON SUN AND WENT SLOWLY DOWN IT MEANING TO COME ABOUT THE INSIDE OF THE WALL TILL HE SHOULD HIT THE EAST GATE
6749-53254-0018 WHEN THE FOLK SHOULD HAVE GONE THEIR WAYS HOME HE SAW NO FOLK IN THE STREET SAVE HERE AND THERE AN OLD WOMAN SITTING AT THE DOOR OF HER HOUSE AND MAYBE A YOUNG CHILD WITH HER AS HE CAME TO WHERE THE STREET TURNED SOMEWHAT
6749-53254-0019 EVEN SUCH A CARLINE WAS SITTING ON A CLEAN WHITE DOOR STEP ON THE SUNNY SIDE SOMEWHAT SHADED BY A TALL ROSE LAUREL TREE IN A GREAT TUB AND SHE SANG AS SHE SAT SPINNING AND RALPH STAYED TO LISTEN IN HIS IDLE MOOD
6749-53254-0020 AND HE HEARD HOW SHE SANG IN A DRY HARSH VOICE
6749-53254-0021 RED FLAMES WAR'S CANDLE WICK ON ROOF AND RICK
6749-53254-0022 WITH BLOOD ON THEIR FEET FOR YET TWIXT THE BURG GATE AND BATTLE HALF WON THE DUST DRIVEN HIGHWAY CREEPS UPHILL AND ON AND THE SMOKE
6749-53254-0023 THE MOON'S O'ERHEAD AND WE NEED THE CLEAR OUR SPOIL TO SHARE SHAKE THE LOTS IN THE HELM THEN FOR BRETHREN ARE WE AND THE GOODS OF MY MISSING
6749-53254-0024 AND NOUGHT HAVE I WON BUT THE MAIDEN UNMERRY BY BATTLE UNDONE EVEN AS HER SONG ENDED CAME ONE OF THOSE FAIR YELLOW GOWNED DAMSELS ROUND THE CORNER OF THE STREET
6749-53254-0025 AND IT WAS PLEASANT TO RALPH TO BEHOLD HER FOR SHE WAS AS FAIR AS NEED BE
6749-53254-0026 THE ROSINESS OF HER ANCLES SHOWED AMIDST HER WHITE SANDAL THONGS AND THERE WERE SILVER RINGS AND GOLD ON HER ARMS ALONG WITH THE IRON RING NOW SHE LIFTED UP HER EYES AND LOOKED SHYLY AT RALPH
6749-53254-0027 AND HE SMILED AT HER WELL PLEASED AND DEEMED IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HEAR HER VOICE SO HE WENT UP TO HER AND GREETED HER AND SHE SEEMED TO TAKE HIS GREETING WELL THOUGH SHE GLANCED SWIFTLY AT THE CARLINE IN THE DOORWAY SAID RALPH
6749-53254-0028 NOW WILT THOU TELL ME BEFORE I ASK THE NEXT QUESTION WHO WILL BE THOSE WAR TAKEN THRALLS WHOM EVEN NOW I SAW BROUGHT INTO THE BURG BY THE HOST OF WHAT NATION BE THEY AND OF WHAT KINDRED
6749-53254-0029 SHE LEFT HER DAINTY TRICKS AND DREW HERSELF UP STRAIGHT AND STIFF
6749-53254-0030 FLUSHING RED AND WITH KNIT BROWS A MOMENT AND THEN PASSED BY HIM WITH SWIFT AND FIRM FEET AS ONE BOTH ANGRY AND ASHAMED BUT THE CARLINE WHO HAD BEHELD THE TWO WITH A GRIN ON HER WRINKLED FACE
6749-53254-0031 AND CRIED OUT FIERCELY AFTER THE DAMSEL AND SAID WHAT DOST THOU FLEE FROM THE FAIR YOUNG MAN AND HE SO KIND AND SOFT WITH THEE THOU JADE
6749-53254-0032 AH IF I HAD BUT MONEY TO BUY SOME ONE OF YOU AND A GOOD ONE
6749-53254-0033 TILL SHE SHOULD CURSE HER FATE THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN BORN LITTLE AND DARK SKINNED AND FREE AND WITH HEELS UN BLOODIED WITH THE BLOOD OF HER BACK THUS SHE WENT ON THOUGH THE DAMSEL WAS LONG OUT OF EAR SHOT OF HER CURSES
6749-53254-0034 AND RALPH TARRIED NOT TO GET AWAY FROM HER SPITEFUL BABBLE WHICH HE NOW PARTLY UNDERSTOOD AND THAT ALL THOSE YELLOW CLAD DAMSELS WERE THRALLS TO THE FOLK OF THE BURG
6749-53254-0035 WHOM HE HAD SEEN AMIDST THE HOST AT ITS ENTERING INTO THE BURG SO HE WANDERED AWAY THENCE THINKING ON WHAT HE SHOULD DO TILL THE SUN WAS SET AND HE HAD COME INTO THE OPEN SPACE UNDERNEATH THE WALLS AND HAD GONE ALONG IT TILL HE CAME TO THE EAST GATE
6749-53254-0036 THERE HE LOOKED AROUND HIM A LITTLE
6749-53254-0037 SINCE THEY SUNDERED AT THE WANT WAY
6749-53254-0038 FOR HE FELT HIMSELF UNFREE THEREIN AND HE SAID TO HIMSELF
6749-53254-0039 THAT HE HAD BETTER NEVER HAVE STOLEN HIMSELF AWAY FROM HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND WHILES EVEN HE THOUGHT
6749-53254-0040 THERE SEEMED TO HIM A LACK AND WHEN HE QUESTIONED HIMSELF AS TO WHAT THAT LACK WAS STRAIGHTWAY HE SEEMED TO SEE THAT LADY OF THE WILDWOOD STANDING BEFORE THE MEN AT ARMS IN HER SCANTY RAIMENT THE MINUTE BEFORE HIS LIFE WAS AT ADVENTURE BECAUSE OF THEM
6749-53254-0041 AND IN SOOTH HE SMILED TO HIMSELF THEN WITH A BEATING HEART
6749-53254-0042 WHATEVER SHE MIGHT BE AND THAT HE WOULD FOLLOW HIS ADVENTURE TO THE END UNTIL HE MET HER
