5013-31101-0000 MELODY UNFORMULATE MUSIC IMMATERIAL SUCH WAS THE VOICE OF THE SINGING MOUSE FAINT SMALL AND CLEAR
5013-31101-0001 A PIPING OF FIFES SO FINE A TOUCHING OF STRINGS SO DELICATE THAT IT SEEMED TO COME FROM INSTRUMENTS OF BERYL AND OF DIAMOND A PHANTOM MUSIC
5013-31101-0002 IMPOSSIBLE TO FETTER WITH STAFF OR BAR AND PAST THE HOPE OF COMPASSING IN WORDS IT WAS THE LAST NIGHT OF THE YEAR AND THE BELL UPON THE CHURCH NEAR BY
5013-31101-0003 HAD MADE MANY STROKES THE LAST TIME IT HAD BEEN HEARD MANY HEAVY STROKES WHICH THROBBED SULLENLY MOURNFULLY ON THE AIR THE PRESENCE OF PASSING TIME WAS AT HAND
5013-31101-0004 REGRET REMORSE DESPAIR ABANDONMENT THE HOPELESSNESS OF HUMANITY WAS IT THE BREATH OF THESE WHICH AROSE AND BURDENED HEAVILY THE NOTE OF THE CHRONICLING BELL
5013-31101-0005 THESE SHADOWS THAT YOU SEE ARE NOT UPON THE WALL SAID THE SINGING MOUSE THEY ARE VERY MUCH BEYOND THE WINDOWS IF ONLY WE WILL LOOK OUT FROM OUR WINDOWS
5013-31101-0006 THERE ARE ALWAYS GREAT PICTURES WAITING FOR US PICTURES IN PEARL AND OPAL IN LIQUID ARGENT IN CRIMSON AND GOLD BUT ALWAYS THERE MUST BE THE SHADOWS
5013-31101-0007 WITHOUT THESE THERE CAN BE NO PICTURE ANYWHERE HAVE YOU NOT SEEN WHAT THE SHADOWS DO HAVE YOU NOT SEEN THEM TROOPING THROUGH THE OAK FOREST IN THE EVENING THROUGH THE PINE FOREST IN OPEN DAY
5013-31101-0008 ACROSS THE PRAIRIES UNDER THE MOON AT NIGHT LEGIONS OF THEM ARMIES OF THEM HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN THEM MARCH ACROSS THE GRASS LANDS IN THE DAYTIME COHORT AFTER COHORT
5013-31101-0009 HURRYING TO THE CALL OF THE UNSEEN TRUMPETS IN THE WOODS HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD STRANGE SOUNDS
5013-31101-0010 SOUNDS UNTRACEABLE TO ANY ANIMATE LIFE HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD VAGUE VOICES IN THE TREES HAVE YOU NOT HEARD DISTANT MYSTERIOUS NOISES IN THE FOREST
5013-31101-0011 WHOSE CAUSE YOU COULD NEVER LEARN SEEK NO MATTER HOW YOU MIGHT THESE WERE THE VOICES OF THE SHADOWS THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE
5013-31101-0012 WHO ELSE SHOULD IT BE TO WHISPER AND SING TO YOU AND MAKE YOU HAPPY WHEN YOU ARE THERE WITHOUT THESE PEOPLE WHAT WOULD BE THE WOODS THE PRAIRIES THE WATERS THE SKY
5013-31101-0013 THE WORLD WITHOUT THE SHADOWS TOO WHAT WOULD BE OUR LIVES THOUGHTS THOUGHTS AND REMEMBRANCES WHAT HAVE WE THAT IS SWEETER THAN THESE
5013-31101-0014 HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN THE SMILE UPON THE LIPS OF THOSE WHO HAVE DIED THEY SAY THEY ARE LOOKING UPON THE FUTURE PERHAPS
5013-31101-0015 AND THEREFORE SMILE IN HAPPINESS SEEING AGAIN YOUTH AND HOPE AND FAITH AND TRUST WHICH ARE TENDER AND BEAUTIFUL THINGS LIFE
5013-31101-0016 HAS NO ACTUALITY OF ITS OWN AND IN MATERIAL SENSE IS ONLY A CONTINUAL CHANGE BUT THE SHADOWS OF THOUGHT AND OF REMEMBRANCE DO NOT CHANGE IT IS ONLY THE SHADOWS
5013-31101-0017 THAT ARE REAL AS I PONDERED UPON THIS THERE PASSED BY MANY PLEASANT PICTURES UPON THE WALL AFTER THE WAY THE SINGING MOUSE HAD MANY PICTURES OF DAYS GONE BY WHICH MADE ME THINK
5013-31101-0018 THAT PERHAPS WHAT THE SINGING MOUSE HAD SAID WAS TRUE I COULD SEE THE BOY SITTING IDLE AND A DREAM WATCHING THE SHADOWS DRIFTING ACROSS THE CLOVER FIELDS
5013-31101-0019 WHERE THE BIG BEES CAME I SAW THE YOUTH WANDERING IN THE WOODS WHERE THE SQUIRRELS LIVED LOITERING AND LOOKING PEERING INTO CORNERS FULL OF THE SECRETS OF THE WILD CREATURES UNRAVELING THE DELICIOUS MYSTERIES
5013-31101-0020 IT WAS A COMFORTABLE PICTURE FULL OF THE BRILLIANT GREENS OF SPRINGTIME THE MELLOW TINTS OF SUMMER THE RED AND RUSSET OF AUTUMN DAYS THE BLUE AND WHITE OF WINTER
5013-31101-0021 I COULD HEAR ALSO SOUNDS INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SCENES BEFORE ME THE BLEAT OF LITTLE LAMBS THE LOW OF CATTLE
5013-31101-0022 AND THEN BOTH SOUND AND SCENE PROGRESSED AND ONCE MORE AS THE WOODS AND HILLS GREW BOLDER AND MORE WILD I COULD HEAR CLEARLY THE RIFLE'S THIN REPORT
5013-31101-0023 COULD NOTE THE WHISPER OF THE SECRET LOVING PADDLE THE SLIPPING OF THE SNOW SHOE ON THE SNOW THE CLATTER OF THE HOOFS OF HORSES THE BAYING OF THE BELL MOUTHED HOUNDS
5013-31101-0024 THE DELIGHTS OF IT ALL CAME BACK AGAIN AND IN THIS VARIED PHANTOM CHASE AMONG THE KEEN JOYS OF THE PAST I SAW AS PLAINLY AND EXULTANTLY AS EVER IN MY LIFE
5013-31101-0025 THE PANORAMA OF THE BROWN WOODS AND THE GRAY PLAINS AND THE PURPLE HILLS SAW IT DISTINCTLY WITH ALL THE OLD VIBRANT JOY OF YOUTH LINE FOR LINE
5013-31101-0026 SOUND FOR SOUND SHADOW FOR SHADOW JOY FOR JOY AND THEN THE SINGING MOUSE WITHOUT WISH OF MINE
5013-31101-0027 CAUSED THESE SCENES TO CHANGE INTO OTHERS OF MORE QUIET SORT WHICH TOLD NOT OF THE FIELDS BUT OF THE HOME IN THE SHADOWS OF EVENING
5013-31101-0028 I SEEMED TO SEE A PLEASANT PLACE WELL SURROUNDED BY TREES AND FLOWERS THE LEAVES OF WHICH WERE STIRRED SOFTLY IN THE BREATH OF A FAINT SUMMER BREEZE STRONG ENOUGH
5013-31101-0029 ONLY TO CARRY ALOFT IN ITS HANDS THE ODOR OF THE BLOOMING ROSE THIS PICTURE FADED SLOWLY THERE WERE SHADOWS IN THE SPACES BETWEEN THE TREES
5013-31101-0030 ONE COULD ONLY GUESS IF HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF GARB OR OF THE OUTLINE OF A FORM AMONG THE SHADOWS HE COULD ONLY GUESS TOO WHETHER HE HEARD MUSIC FAINT AS THE BREEZE
5013-31101-0031 FAINT AS THE INCENSE OF THE FLOWERS HE COULD ONLY GUESS IF HE HAD SEEN THE IMAGE OF THE HOUSE BEAUTIFUL THAT TEMPLE KNOWN AS HOME THOUGHTS
5013-31101-0032 SAID THE SINGING MOUSE SOFTLY THOUGHTS AND REMEMBRANCES THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT LIVE FOR EVER IT IS ONLY THE SHADOWS THAT ARE REAL
5013-31101-0033 THE SOLEMN NOTE OF THE BELL STRUCK IN IT COUNTED TWELVE THE NEW YEAR HAD COME THE CHIMES OF JOY AROSE BUT STILL
5013-31101-0034 THE FAINT MUSIC FROM THE PAST HAD NOT DIED AWAY AND STILL THE SHADOWS WAVED AND BECKONED ON THE WALL STRONG AND BEAUTIFUL AND ENDURING AND NOT
5013-31101-0035 LIKE THE FADING OF A DREAM SO THEN I KNEW THAT WHAT THE SINGING MOUSE HAD SAID WAS TRUE AND THAT IT IS INDEED
