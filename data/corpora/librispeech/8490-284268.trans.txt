8490-284268-0003 AND HE WAS ALREADY A LEADING ORATOR AMONG THE MIMBRENO APACHES WHEN HE WAS LEAST TALKATIVE HE WAS MOST DANGEROUS FINALLY ZAYIGO SAID IMPATIENTLY
8490-284268-0004 WE SIT BESIDE THE YOUNGEST MIMBRENO APACHE EVER TO BECOME A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL OF WARRIORS YET HE SULKS LIKE A SCOLDED CHILD
8490-284268-0005 SINCE LEAVING THE MIMBRENO VILLAGE GERONIMO YOU HAVE SMOLDERED LIKE A FIRE THAT IS NOT QUITE ABLE TO BURST INTO FLAME
8490-284268-0006 IS IT BECAUSE SOME WARRIORS SPOKE AGAINST YOU WHEN THEY MET TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOU MIGHT BE ADMITTED TO THE COUNCIL I CARE NOT WHO SPEAKS AGAINST ME GERONIMO SAID SOURLY
8490-284268-0007 ANY WHO CONSIDER ME UNWORTHY OF BEING A MIMBRENO WARRIOR I'LL FIGHT GLADLY
8490-284268-0008 ZAYIGO SAID QUICKLY THEY SAID ONLY THAT YOU ARE RECKLESS AND HEADSTRONG AND THAT TROUBLE GOES WHERE YOU DO
8490-284268-0009 THERE ARE SOME MIMBRENO WARRIORS WHO HAVE THE COWARDLY SOULS OF MEXICANS GERONIMO GRUNTED AND I DO NOT MEAN THAT YOU ARE A COWARD PEDRO
8490-284268-0010 PEDRO GONZALEZ SAID QUIETLY MEXICAN I WAS ONCE APACHE I AM NOW THAT WAS TRUE CAPTURED IN MEXICO WHEN HE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD
8490-284268-0011 PEDRO HAD BEEN ADOPTED BY AN APACHE FAMILY HE HAD TAKEN SO READILY TO APACHE WAYS THAT HE WAS NOW ONE OF THEIR FINEST AND FIERCEST WARRIORS HE SPOKE AGAIN
8490-284268-0012 IF YOU CARE NOT BECAUSE SOME SPOKE AGAINST YOU WHAT IS THE TROUBLE IT IS NO PLEASURE TO GO RAIDING
8490-284268-0013 GERONIMO SAID BITTERLY NE PO SE WAS ONE OF THE MEN WHO SPOKE AGAINST ME
8490-284268-0014 ZAYIGO SAID BUT THAT IS NO NEWS IN THE MIMBRENO VILLAGE
8490-284268-0015 WHEN IT IS POSSIBLE
8490-284268-0016 FOR A MOMENT GERONIMO DID NOT ANSWER
8490-284268-0017 HER IMAGE ACCOMPANIED HIM WHEREVER HE WENT BY DAY AND HAUNTED HIS DREAMS BY NIGHT HE WAS AS DEEPLY IN LOVE AS A YOUNG MAN CAN BE HE SAID FINALLY WHEN I BECAME A WARRIOR IN FULL STANDING
8490-284268-0018 HE SNEERED AT ME AND SAID TO COME BACK WHEN I COULD OFFER TEN HORSES FOR HIS DAUGHTER'S HAND
8490-284268-0019 ZAYIGO SAID IN ASTONISHMENT THAT IS UNHEARD OF
8490-284268-0020 PAY FOR MY BRIDE WHAT SHE IS WORTH GERONIMO SAID THAT IS WHY WE ARE IN MEXICO WHERE THERE ARE PLENTY OF HORSES FOR THE TAKING HE SPOKE MORE EASILY
8490-284268-0021 FOR TALKING ABOUT HIS TROUBLES HAD MADE THEM SEEM LESS ZAYIGO AND PEDRO GONZALEZ SMILED THEIR WHITE TEETH FLASHING IN THE DARKNESS NOW YOU TALK AS THE LEADER WE HOPED WE WERE FOLLOWING PEDRO GONZALEZ SAID HAPPILY
8490-284268-0022 AND WHEN IT COMES TO STEALING HORSES NO WARRIORS ARE MORE CLEVER THAN GERONIMO YOU SHALL GAIN THE PRICE OF YOUR BRIDE I SHALL HAVE THE PRICE OR I SHALL NOT RETURN TO THE MIMBRENO VILLAGE
8490-284268-0023 GERONIMO VOWED AND I KNOW WE SHALL RETURN FOR WE GO AGAINST MEXICANS I THINK IT MUST BE TRUE THAT SOMETHING IN THE FOOD THEY EAT
8490-284268-0024 OR THE WATER THEY DRINK TURNS THE MARROW OF MEXICAN MEN'S BONES TO JELLY AS SOON AS THEY BECOME MEN CAPTIVE MEXICAN WOMEN FIT VERY WELL INTO OUR TRIBE AS DO CHILDREN IF TAKEN YOUNG ENOUGH
8490-284268-0025 THE MEN DO LITTLE EXCEPT TREMBLE WITH FEAR AND THAT IS WHY IT IS BETTER TO KILL THAN CAPTURE THEM PEDRO GONZALEZ LAUGHED JOYOUSLY
8490-284268-0026 IT IS LONG SINCE I HAVE FOUGHT MEXICANS LET US HOPE THIS IS A GOOD FIGHT THEY CURLED UP IN THEIR BLANKETS AND SLEPT THE NIGHT WAS STILL BLACK ABOUT THEM WHEN THEY ROSE TO GO ON
8490-284268-0027 TRAVELING AT A LOOSE LEGGED GAIT THAT COVERED THE GROUND WITH AMAZING SPEED THEY WERE MANY MILES FROM THEIR CAMPING PLACE WHEN THE SUN ROSE THEY STOPPED TO NIBBLE PARCHED CORN FROM POUCHES THAT HUNG AT THEIR BELTS
8490-284268-0028 RESTED LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES AND WENT ON GERONIMO WHO HAD BEEN THIS WAY MANY TIMES AND WHO ALSO HAD A SPLENDID SENSE OF DIRECTION LED THE OTHERS THROUGH STEEP WALLED CANYONS AND OVER
8490-284268-0029 BRUSH GROWN HILLTOPS BY MIDAFTERNOON THEY WERE LOOKING FROM THE TOP OF A HILL DOWN ON THE RANCHERIA THEY INTENDED TO RAID THE HOUSE AND OTHER BUILDINGS WERE BUILT OF ADOBE OR SUN DRIED BRICK
8490-284268-0030 TO ONE SIDE WERE EXTENSIVE CORRALS MADE OF POLES THAT HAD BEEN LABORIOUSLY HAULED FROM SOME RIVER BOTTOM OR OTHER WHERE TREES WERE PLENTIFUL THERE WERE ABOUT FIFTY HORSES IN THE CORRALS
8490-284268-0031 THE THREE APACHES CROUCHED IN THE BRUSH AND BIDED THEIR TIME THEY WERE HEEDLESS OF THE SUN THAT BURNED DOWN UPON THEM THIRST THAT WOULD HAVE DRIVEN A WHITE MAN MAD BOTHERED THEM NOT AT ALL
8490-284268-0032 THEY WERE TRAINED TO ENDURE THIRST AN HOUR BEFORE DARK SEVERAL MEXICAN RIDERS CAME WITH A HERD OF FORTY HORSES THEY PUT THEM IN THE SAME CORRAL WHERE THE FIFTY WERE ALREADY CONFINED
8490-284268-0033 AND TURNED THEIR OWN SADDLE MOUNTS IN WITH THEM TWO MORE RIDERS CAME STRIPPED SADDLES AND BRIDLES FROM THEIR MOUNTS AND SHUT THEM IN THE CORRAL THEN ALL THE MEXICANS WENT INTO THE HOUSE
8490-284268-0034 NIGHT FELL BEFORE THE THREE APACHES STIRRED GERONIMO GAVE HIS ORDERS ZAYIGO AND PEDRO KEEP THOSE IN THE HOUSE FROM COMING OUT I GO TO THE CORRAL
8490-284268-0035 GERONIMO SLIPPED AWAY IN THE DARKNESS HE COULD NO LONGER SEE THE CORRAL BUT HIS SENSE OF DIRECTION WAS SO SURE THAT HE WENT EXACTLY TO IT THE MEXICANS HAD DRAPED THEIR SADDLES OVER THE TOP RAIL
8490-284268-0036 AND HUNG THEIR BRIDLES ON THE SADDLE HORNS TAKING NO SADDLES FOR ALL THREE RAIDERS WERE EXPERT BAREBACK RIDERS GERONIMO LOOPED THREE BRIDLES OVER HIS SHOULDER AND ENTERED THE CORRAL
8490-284268-0037 THEN WHEELED TO RUN TO THE CORRAL'S FAR SIDE
8490-284268-0038 THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE WAS FLUNG OPEN BUT WHEN ZAYIGO'S RIFLE SPOKE THE DOOR WAS SLAMMED SHUT QUICKLY STILL REFUSING TO HURRY GERONIMO CAUGHT AND BRIDLED TWO MORE HORSES SITTING HIS OWN MOUNT
8490-284268-0039 AND HOLDING THE REINS OF THE OTHER TWO HE WHISTLED SHRILLY ZAYIGO AND PEDRO GONZALEZ APPEARED OUT OF THE DARKNESS NOT SPEAKING FOR EACH KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE MUST DO THEY MOUNTED THE TWO BRIDLED HORSES
8490-284268-0040 GERONIMO OPENED THE GATE AND THE THREE DROVE THE HERD THROUGH THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF OTHER HORSES GRAZING ON THE VAST ACREAGE OF THE RANCHERIA BUT THIS WAS THE ONLY HERD KEPT NEAR THE HOUSE AND THE RAIDERS HAD BEEN CAREFUL TO TAKE ALL OF THEM
8490-284268-0041 CAME TO INQUIRE ABOUT IT
8490-284268-0042 SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVED IN THE MIMBRENO VILLAGE BUT SINCE MOST APACHES LIKED PLENTY OF ROOM BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THEIR NEIGHBORS THE VILLAGE WAS SPREAD OVER SEVERAL HILLS
8490-284268-0043 DEER ANTELOPE PUMA AND OTHER CREATURES THAT FELL TO HIS HUNTING ARROWS THERE WERE NO BEAR SKINS BECAUSE BEARS ARE SACRED TO APACHES THE FOLLOWING TWELVE YEARS WERE PROBABLY THE ONLY TRULY HAPPY ONES GERONIMO EVER KNEW
