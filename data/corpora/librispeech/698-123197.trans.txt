698-123197-0000 WHEN CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS CAME THE GIRLS OF PATTY'S PLACE SCATTERED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES
698-123197-0001 I COULDN'T GO TO ANY OF THE PLACES I'VE BEEN INVITED AND TAKE THOSE THREE CATS SHE SAID AND I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE THE POOR CREATURES HERE ALONE FOR NEARLY THREE WEEKS
698-123197-0002 BUT THERE'S NOTHING EXCEPT MILLIONAIRES ON THIS STREET SO I'LL STAY HERE AND KEEP PATTY'S PLACE WARM FOR YOU
698-123197-0003 WHICH WERE NOT WHOLLY FULFILLED SHE FOUND AVONLEA IN THE GRIP OF SUCH AN EARLY COLD AND STORMY WINTER AS EVEN THE OLDEST INHABITANT COULD NOT RECALL GREEN GABLES WAS LITERALLY HEMMED IN BY HUGE DRIFTS ALMOST EVERY DAY OF THAT ILL STARRED VACATION IT STORMED FIERCELY
698-123197-0004 AND EVEN ON FINE DAYS IT DRIFTED UNCEASINGLY NO SOONER WERE THE ROADS BROKEN THAN THEY FILLED IN AGAIN IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO STIR OUT THE A V I S TRIED ON THREE EVENINGS TO HAVE A PARTY IN HONOR OF THE COLLEGE STUDENTS
698-123197-0005 AND ON EACH EVENING THE STORM WAS SO WILD THAT NOBODY COULD GO SO THEY GAVE UP THE ATTEMPT IN DESPAIR ANNE DESPITE HER LOVE OF AND LOYALTY TO GREEN GABLES COULD NOT HELP THINKING LONGINGLY OF PATTY'S PLACE ITS COSY OPEN FIRE
698-123197-0006 THE THREE CATS THE MERRY CHATTER OF THE GIRLS THE PLEASANTNESS OF FRIDAY EVENINGS WHEN COLLEGE FRIENDS DROPPED IN TO TALK OF GRAVE AND GAY ANNE WAS LONELY DIANA DURING THE WHOLE OF THE HOLIDAYS WAS IMPRISONED AT HOME WITH A BAD ATTACK OF BRONCHITIS SHE COULD NOT COME TO GREEN GABLES
698-123197-0007 FOR THE OLD WAY THROUGH THE HAUNTED WOOD WAS IMPASSABLE WITH DRIFTS AND THE LONG WAY OVER THE FROZEN LAKE OF SHINING WATERS WAS ALMOST AS BAD RUBY GILLIS WAS SLEEPING IN THE WHITE HEAPED GRAVEYARD JANE ANDREWS WAS TEACHING A SCHOOL ON WESTERN PRAIRIES GILBERT TO BE SURE WAS STILL FAITHFUL
698-123197-0008 AND WADED UP TO GREEN GABLES EVERY POSSIBLE EVENING BUT GILBERT'S VISITS WERE NOT WHAT THEY ONCE WERE ANNE ALMOST DREADED THEM IT WAS VERY DISCONCERTING TO LOOK UP IN THE MIDST OF A SUDDEN SILENCE AND FIND GILBERT'S HAZEL EYES FIXED UPON HER
698-123197-0009 WITH A QUITE UNMISTAKABLE EXPRESSION IN THEIR GRAVE DEPTHS AND IT WAS STILL MORE DISCONCERTING TO FIND HERSELF BLUSHING HOTLY AND UNCOMFORTABLY UNDER HIS GAZE JUST AS IF JUST AS IF WELL IT WAS VERY EMBARRASSING
698-123197-0010 AT GREEN GABLES MARILLA WENT PROMPTLY TO MISSUS LYNDE'S DOMAIN WHEN GILBERT CAME AND INSISTED ON TAKING THE TWINS WITH HER THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS WAS UNMISTAKABLE AND ANNE WAS IN A HELPLESS FURY OVER IT DAVY HOWEVER WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY
