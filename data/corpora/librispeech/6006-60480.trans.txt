6006-60480-0000 SIAMESE CAT AMONG THE BEAUTIFUL VARIETIES OF THE DOMESTIC CAT BROUGHT INTO NOTICE BY THE CAT SHOWS NONE DESERVE MORE ATTENTION THAN THE ROYAL CAT OF SIAM
6006-60480-0001 AS WOULD BE LIKELY ON ACCOUNT OF THE EXTREME SHORTNESS OF THEIR FUR WHICH IS OF BOTH A HAIRY AND A WOOLLY TEXTURE AND NOT SO GLOSSY AS OUR ORDINARY COMMON DOMESTIC CAT NOR IS THE TAIL WHICH IS THIN
6006-60480-0002 THE LATE DUKE OF WELLINGTON IMPORTED THE BREED ALSO MISTER SCOTT OF ROTHERFIELD LADY DOROTHY NEVILL THOUGHT THEM EXCEEDINGLY DOCILE AND DOMESTIC BUT DELICATE IN THEIR CONSTITUTION ALTHOUGH HER LADYSHIP KEPT ONE FOR TWO YEARS ANOTHER OVER A YEAR
6006-60480-0003 BUT EVENTUALLY ALL DIED OF THE SAME COMPLAINT THAT OF WORMS WHICH PERMEATED EVERY PART OF THEIR BODY MISTER YOUNG OF HARROGATE POSSESSES A CHOCOLATE VARIETY OF THIS ROYAL SIAMESE CAT IT WAS SENT FROM SINGAPORE TO MISTER BRENNAND
6006-60480-0004 FROM WHOM HE PURCHASED IT AND IS DESCRIBED AS MOST LOVING AND AFFECTIONATE WHICH I BELIEVE IS USUALLY THE CASE
6006-60480-0005 ALTHOUGH THIS PECULIAR COLOUR IS VERY BEAUTIFUL AND SCARCE I AM OF OPINION THAT THE LIGHT GRAY OR FAWN COLOUR WITH BLACK AND WELL MARKED MUZZLE EARS AND LEGS IS THE TYPICAL VARIETY THE MARKINGS BEING THE SAME AS THE HIMALAYAN RABBITS THERE ARE CAVIES SO MARKED
6006-60480-0006 HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL IT MIGHT BE EVEN BLACK PUGS DO NOT OBTAIN PRIZES IN COMPETITION WITH A TRUE MARKED LIGHT DUN
6006-60480-0007 RICH AND NOT CLOUDED IN ANY WAY BUT I GIVE MISTER YOUNG'S OWN VIEWS THE DUN SIAMESE WE HAVE HAS WON WHENEVER SHOWN
6006-60480-0008 PART OF THE FACE EARS FEET AND TAIL OF A VERY DARK CHOCOLATE BROWN NEARLY BLACK EYES OF A BEAUTIFUL BLUE BY DAY AND OF A RED COLOUR AT NIGHT MY OTHER PRIZE CAT IS OF A VERY RICH CHOCOLATE OR SEAL WITH DARKER FACE EARS AND TAIL
6006-60480-0009 THE LEGS ARE A SHADE DARKER WHICH INTENSIFIES TOWARDS THE FEET
6006-60480-0010 AND NOT SO MUCH HAIR BETWEEN THE EYES AND THE EARS AS THE ENGLISH CATS HAVE THE DUN UNLESS UNDER SPECIAL JUDGES INVARIABLY BEATS THE CHOCOLATE AT THE SHOWS THE TAIL IS SHORTER AND FINER THAN OUR ENGLISH CATS
6006-60480-0011 I MAY ADD THAT WE LATELY HAVE HAD FOUR KITTENS FROM THE CHOCOLATE CAT BY A PURE DUN SIAMESE HE CAT ALL THE YOUNG ARE DUN COLOURED AND WHEN BORN WERE VERY LIGHT NEARLY WHITE BUT ARE GRADUALLY GETTING THE DARK POINTS OF THE PARENTS IN FACT
6006-60480-0012 I EXPECT THAT ONE WILL TURN CHOCOLATE THE CATS ARE VERY AFFECTIONATE AND MAKE CHARMING LADIES PETS BUT ARE RATHER MORE DELICATE THAN OUR CATS BUT AFTER THEY HAVE ONCE WINTERED IN ENGLAND THEY SEEM TO GET ACCLIMATISED MISTER BRENNAND WHO BROUGHT THE CHOCOLATE ONE AND ANOTHER A MALE
6006-60480-0013 FROM SINGAPORE LAST YEAR INFORMS ME THAT THERE ARE TWO VARIETIES A LARGE AND SMALL OURS ARE THE SMALL HE ALSO TELLS ME THE CHOCOLATE IS THE MOST RARE I HAVE HEARD A LITTLE MORE REGARDING THE SIAMESE CATS FROM MISS WALKER THE DAUGHTER OF GENERAL WALKER
6006-60480-0014 WHO BROUGHT OVER ONE MALE AND THREE FEMALES IT SEEMS THE ONLY PURE BREED IS KEPT AT THE KING OF SIAM'S PALACE AND THE CATS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO PROCURE FOR IN SIAM IT TOOK THREE DIFFERENT GENTLEMEN OF GREAT INFLUENCE THREE MONTHS BEFORE THEY COULD GET ANY
6006-60480-0015 IT IS MY INTENTION TO TRY AND BREED FROM A WHITE ENGLISH FEMALE WITH BLUE EYES AND A SIAMESE MALE THE SIAMESE CATS ARE VERY PROLIFIC BREEDERS HAVING GENERALLY FIVE AT EACH LITTER AND THREE LITTERS A YEAR WE HAVE NEVER SUCCEEDED IN BREEDING ANY LIKE OUR CHOCOLATE CAT
6006-60480-0016 THEY ALL COME FAWN WITH BLACK OR DARK BROWN POINTS THE LAST FAMILY ARE A LITTLE DARKER ON THEIR BACKS WHICH GIVES THEM A RICHER APPEARANCE THAN THE PALE FAWN HITHERTO WE HAVE NEVER HAD ANY HALF BRED SIAMESE BUT THERE USED TO BE A MALE SIAMESE AT HURWORTH ON TEES
6006-60480-0017 AND THERE WERE MANY YOUNG BRED FROM ENGLISH CATS THEY INVARIABLY SHOWED THE SIAMESE CROSS IN THE GROUND COLOUR FROM THE FOREGOING IT WILL BE SEEN HOW VERY DIFFICULT IT IS TO OBTAIN THE PURE BREED EVEN IN SIAM
6006-60480-0018 AND WERE ONLY GOT BY THOSE SO FORTUNATE AS A MOST EXTRAORDINARY FAVOUR AS THE KING OF SIAM IS MOST JEALOUS OF KEEPING THE BREED ENTIRELY IN SIAM AS ROYAL CATS THE ONE EXHIBITED BY LADY DOROTHY NEVILL MISSUS POODLE HAD THREE KITTENS BY AN ENGLISH CAT
6006-60480-0019 BUT NONE SHOWED ANY TRACE OF THE SIAMESE BEING ALL TABBY ALTHOUGH MISTER HERBERT YOUNG WAS INFORMED BY MISTER BRENNAND THAT THERE IS ANOTHER AND A LARGER BREED IN SIAM IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT ANY OF THESE HAVE BEEN IMPORTED NOR HAVE WE ANY DESCRIPTION OF THEM
6006-60480-0020 OR WHETHER THEY RESEMBLE THE LESSER VARIETY IN THIS OR ANY RESPECT YET IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT ERE LONG SOME SPECIMENS MAY BE SECURED FOR THIS COUNTRY BESIDES MISTER HERBERT YOUNG I AM ALSO MUCH INDEBTED TO THE COURTESY OF MISSUS VYVYAN
6006-60480-0021 OF DOVER WHO IS A LOVER OF THIS BEAUTIFUL BREED AND WHO KINDLY SENDS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION THE ORIGINAL PAIR WERE SENT FROM BANGKOK AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT THEY CAME FROM THE KING'S PALACE WHERE ALONE THE BREED ARE SAID TO BE KEPT PURE
6006-60480-0022 AFTER MUCH DELAY AND GREAT DIFFICULTY AND SINCE THAT TIME NO OTHERS HAVE BEEN ATTAINABLE BY THE SAME PERSON WE WERE IN CHINA WHEN THEY REACHED US AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX WE BROUGHT THE FATHER MOTHER AND A PAIR OF KITTENS TO ENGLAND
6006-60480-0023 THEIR HABITS ARE IN GENERAL THE SAME AS THE COMMON CAT THOUGH IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED BY STRANGERS THERE IS A PLEASANT WILD ANIMAL ODOUR WHICH IS NOT APPARENT TO US MOST OF THE KITTENS HAVE A KINK IN THE TAIL IT VARIES IN POSITION SOMETIMES IN THE MIDDLE
6006-60480-0024 CLOSE TO THE BODY OR AT THE EXTREME END LIKE A HOOK THIS TALLIES WITH THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN BY MISTER DARWIN OF THE MALAYAN AND ALSO THE SIAMESE CATS SEE MY NOTES ON THE MANX CAT MISTER YOUNG HAD ALSO NOTED THIS PECULIARITY IN THE ROYAL CAT OF SIAM
6006-60480-0025 NOT LIKING TO BE LEFT ALONE AND FOLLOWING US FROM ROOM TO ROOM MORE AFTER THE MANNER OF DOGS THAN CATS THEY ARE DEVOTED PARENTS THE OLD FATHER TAKING THE GREATEST INTEREST IN THE YOUNG ONES THEY ARE FRIENDLY WITH THE DOGS OF THE HOUSE OCCUPYING THE SAME BASKETS
6006-60480-0026 BUT THE MALES ARE VERY STRONG AND FIGHT WITH GREAT PERSISTENCY WITH STRANGE DOGS AND CONQUER ALL OTHER TOM CATS IN THEIR NEIGHBOURHOOD WE LOST ONE HOWEVER A VERY FINE CAT IN CHINA IN THIS WAY AS HE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE ALMOST TORN TO PIECES AND IN A DYING CONDITION
6006-60480-0027 WE FEED THEM ON FRESH FISH BOILED WITH RICE UNTIL THE TWO ARE NEARLY AMALGAMATED THEY ALSO TAKE BREAD AND MILK WARM THE MILK HAVING BEEN BOILED AND THIS DIET SEEMS TO SUIT THEM BETTER THAN ANY OTHER THEY ALSO LIKE CHICKEN AND GAME
6006-60480-0028 WE FIND THESE CATS REQUIRE A GREAT DEAL OF CARE UNLESS THEY LIVE IN THE COUNTRY AND BECOME HARDY THROUGH BEING CONSTANTLY OUT OF DOORS THE KITTENS ARE DIFFICULT TO REAR UNLESS THEY ARE BORN LATE IN THE SPRING THUS HAVING THE WARM WEATHER BEFORE THEM
6006-60480-0029 MOST DEATHS OCCUR BEFORE THEY ARE SIX MONTHS OLD WE HAVE LOST SEVERAL KITTENS FROM WORMS WHICH THEY ENDEAVOUR TO VOMIT AS RELIEF WE GIVE THEM RAW CHICKEN HEADS WITH THE FEATHERS ON WITH SUCCESS WE ALSO GIVE COD LIVER OIL IF THE APPETITE FAILS
6006-60480-0030 UNTIL ABOUT A YEAR OLD THEY ATTAIN PERFECTION WHEN THE POINTS SHOULD BE THE DEEPEST BROWN NEARLY BLACK
6006-60480-0031 NO ONE UNLESS A REAL CAT LOVER SHOULD ATTEMPT TO KEEP THEM THEY CANNOT WITH SAFETY TO THEIR HEALTH BE TREATED AS COMMON CATS DURING SUSAN'S
6006-60480-0032 THE OLD HE CAT CAME DAILY TO CONDOLE WITH HER BRINGING DELICATE ATTENTIONS IN THE FORM OF FRESHLY CAUGHT MICE
6006-60480-0033 WE HAVE AT PRESENT TWO MALES FOUR ADULT FEMALES AND FIVE KITTENS ONE OF OUR KITTENS SENT TO SCOTLAND LAST AUGUST HAS DONE WELL MISSUS LEE OF PENSHURST ALSO HAS SOME FINE SPECIMENS OF THE BREED AND OF THE SAME COLOURS AS DESCRIBED
6006-60480-0034 I TAKE IT THEREFORE THAT THE TRUE BREED BY CONSENSUS OF OPINION IS THAT OF THE DUN FAWN OR ASH COLOURED GROUND WITH BLACK POINTS OTHER COLOURS SHOULD BE SHOWN IN THE VARIETY CLASSES THE HEAD SHOULD BE LONG FROM THE EARS TO THE EYES AND NOT OVER BROAD
6006-60480-0035 AND THEN RATHER SHARPLY TAPER OFF TOWARDS THE MUZZLE THE FOREHEAD FLAT AND RECEDING THE EYES SOMEWHAT ASLANT DOWNWARDS TOWARDS THE NOSE AND THE EYES OF A PEARLY YET BRIGHT BLUE COLOUR THE EARS USUAL SIZE AND BLACK WITH LITTLE OR NO HAIR ON THE INSIDE
6006-60480-0036 WITH BLACK MUZZLE AND ROUND THE EYES BLACK THE FORM SHOULD BE SLIGHT GRACEFUL AND DELICATELY MADE BODY LONG TAIL RATHER SHORT AND THIN AND THE LEGS SOMEWHAT SHORT SLENDER AND THE FEET OVAL NOT SO ROUND AS THE ORDINARY ENGLISH CAT
