3328-166436-0015 AT ANY RATE THE GODDESS WAS BORN SHEDDER OF THE LIGHTNINGS EVEN FROM HER BIRTH
3328-166436-0016 CLEAVE TO YOUR KIND CLEAVE TO YOUR KIND SUDDENLY HE SHRILLED
3328-166436-0017 I WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY TO THEM HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET CLASPED MY WRIST IN ONE OF HIS LONG HANDS LED ME THROUGH THE CURTAINED OVAL INTO THE CYLINDRICAL HALL
3328-166436-0018 AN OVOID SLICE OF THE GEMLIKE MATERIAL SLID ASIDE REVEALING A DOORWAY I GLIMPSED A PATH A TRAIL LEADING INTO A FOREST PALLID GREEN BENEATH THE WAN LIGHT

3328-166436-0021 I FOLLOWED WONDERING WHAT WERE THE SOURCES OF THE BITTER HATRED HE SO PLAINLY BORE FOR US THE REASONS FOR HIS EAGERNESS TO BE RID OF US DESPITE THE COMMANDS OF THIS WOMAN WHO TO HIM AT LEAST WAS GODDESS
3328-166436-0022 AND BY THAT CURIOUS HUMAN HABIT OF SEEKING FOR THE COMPLEX WHEN THE SIMPLE ANSWER LIES CLOSE FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT WAS JEALOUSY OF US THAT WAS THE ROOT OF HIS BEHAVIOR
3328-166436-0023 THAT HE WISHED TO BE AS IT WOULD SEEM HE HAD BEEN FOR YEARS THE ONLY HUMAN THING NEAR NORHALA FAILED TO REALIZE THIS AND WITH RUTH AND DRAKE WAS TERRIBLY TO PAY FOR THIS FAILURE
3328-166436-0024 I LOOKED DOWN UPON THE PAIR SLEEPING SOUNDLY UPON VENTNOR LOST STILL IN TRANCE SIT I ORDERED THE EUNUCH AND TURN YOUR BACK TO ME I DROPPED DOWN BESIDE DRAKE
3328-166436-0025 NOW I FACED IT KNOWING IT TO BE THE VERY CRUX OF THESE INCREDIBLE PHENOMENA ADMITTING TOO THAT DESPITE ALL MY SPECIAL PLEADING ABOUT THAT POINT SWIRLED IN MY OWN MIND THE THICKEST MISTS OF
3328-166436-0026 UNCERTAINTY THAT THEIR SENSE OF ORDER WAS IMMENSELY BEYOND A MAN'S WAS PLAIN AS PLAIN WAS IT THAT THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF MAGNETIC FORCE AND ITS MANIPULATION WERE FAR BEYOND THE SPHERE OF HUMANITY
3328-166436-0027 AND NO HUMAN IMAGINATION COULD HAVE CONCEIVED IT NOR HUMAN HANDS HAVE MADE ITS THOUGHT OF BEAUTY REAL WHAT WERE THEIR SENSES THROUGH WHICH THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS FED
3328-166436-0028 NINE IN NUMBER HAD BEEN THE SAPPHIRE OVALS SET WITHIN THE GOLDEN ZONE OF THE DISK CLEARLY IT CAME TO ME THAT THESE WERE SENSE ORGANS BUT NINE SENSES
3328-166436-0029 AND THE GREAT STARS HOW MANY HAD THEY AND THE CUBES DID THEY OPEN AS DID GLOBE AND PYRAMID CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF AFTER ALL WHAT IS IT A SECRETION OF THE BRAIN
3328-166436-0030 THE CUMULATIVE EXPRESSION WHOLLY CHEMICAL OF THE MULTITUDES OF CELLS THAT FORM US THE INEXPLICABLE GOVERNOR OF THE CITY OF THE BODY OF WHICH
3328-166436-0031 A SELF REALIZING FORCE WHICH USES THE BODY AS ITS VEHICLE JUST AS OTHER FORCES USE FOR THEIR VESTMENTS OTHER MACHINES AFTER ALL I THOUGHT WHAT IS THIS CONSCIOUS SELF OF OURS
3328-166436-0032 THE EGO BUT A SPARK OF REALIZATION RUNNING CONTINUOUSLY ALONG THE PATH OF TIME WITHIN THE MECHANISM WE CALL THE BRAIN MAKING CONTACT ALONG THAT PATH AS THE ELECTRIC SPARK AT THE END OF A WIRE
3328-166436-0033 LIMITED IN ITS EXPRESSION ONLY BY THE LIMITATIONS OF THAT WHICH ANIMATES AND IN ESSENCE THE SAME IN ALL IF SO
3328-166436-0034 CEASED TO BE A PROBLEM WAS ANSWERED SO THINKING I BECAME AWARE OF INCREASING LIGHT STRODE PAST YURUK TO THE DOOR AND PEEPED OUT DAWN WAS PALING THE SKY
3328-166436-0035 WHY IT'S DAWN HE WHISPERED GOODWIN YOU OUGHT NOT TO HAVE LET ME SLEEP SO LONG I FEEL LIKE A DAMNED PIG NEVER MIND I SAID BUT WATCH THE EUNUCH CLOSELY
