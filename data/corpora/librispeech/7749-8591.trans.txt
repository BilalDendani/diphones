7749-8591-0000 I SAID OFFERING MY CASE FOR THE MOMENT LODER WAS NOT SMOKING FOR LONG ENOUGH HE HAD NOT BEEN TALKING THANKS HE REPLIED TAKING NOT ONLY THE CIGARETTE BUT THE CASE ALSO THE OTHERS WENT ON TALKING LODER BECAME SILENT AGAIN
7749-8591-0001 AND LOOKED AT IT FROM TIME TO TIME WITH AN INTEREST THAT NEITHER ITS DESIGN NOR ITS COSTLINESS SEEMED TO EXPLAIN PRESENTLY I CAUGHT HIS EYE A PRETTY CASE HE REMARKED PUTTING IT DOWN ON THE TABLE I ONCE HAD ONE EXACTLY LIKE IT
7749-8591-0002 I ANSWERED THAT THEY WERE IN EVERY SHOP WINDOW OH YES HE SAID
7749-8591-0003 I LOST MINE OH HE LAUGHED OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT I GOT IT BACK AGAIN DON'T BE AFRAID I'M GOING TO CLAIM YOURS BUT THE WAY I LOST IT FOUND IT THE WHOLE THING WAS RATHER CURIOUS I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPLAIN IT
7749-8591-0004 I WONDER IF YOU COULD I ANSWERED THAT I CERTAINLY COULDN'T TILL I'D HEARD IT WHEREUPON LODER TAKING UP THE SILVER CASE AGAIN AND HOLDING IT IN HIS HAND AS HE TALKED BEGAN THIS HAPPENED IN PROVENCE WHEN I WAS ABOUT AS OLD AS MARSHAM THERE
7749-8591-0005 AND EVERY BIT AS ROMANTIC I WAS THERE WITH CARROLL YOU REMEMBER POOR OLD CARROLL
7749-8591-0006 EXCUSE ME MARSHAM WON'T YOU IT'S A ROMANTIC TALE YOU SEE OR AT LEAST THE SETTING IS
7749-8591-0007 TWENTY FOUR OR THEREABOUTS ROMANTIC AS I SAY AND AND THIS HAPPENED AND IT HAPPENED ON THE TOP OF A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER THINGS YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THE THINGS THAT DO HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE TWENTY FOUR
7749-8591-0008 IF IT HADN'T BEEN PROVENCE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE ELSE I SUPPOSE NEARLY IF NOT QUITE AS GOOD BUT THIS WAS PROVENCE THAT SMELLS AS YOU MIGHT SAY OF TWENTY FOUR AS IT SMELLS OF ARGELASSE AND WILD LAVENDER AND BROOM
7749-8591-0009 WE'D HAD THE DICKENS OF A WALK OF IT JUST WITH KNAPSACKS
7749-8591-0010 AT THAT BLANCHED SKELETON OF A TOWN LES BAUX WE'D NOTHING TO DO AND HAD GONE JUST WHERE WE LIKED OR RATHER JUST WHERE CARROLL HAD LIKED AND CARROLL HAD HAD THE DE BELLO GALLICO IN HIS POCKET AND HAD HAD A NOTION I FANCY
7749-8591-0011 I REMEMBER HE LUGGED ME OFF TO SOME PLACE OR OTHER
7749-8591-0012 ITS NAME WAS BECAUSE I FORGET HOW MANY THOUSANDS WERE KILLED IN A RIVER BED THERE AND THEY STOVE IN THE WATER CASKS SO THAT IF THE MEN WANTED WATER THEY'D HAVE TO GO FORWARD AND FIGHT FOR IT
7749-8591-0013 BOW OF BLACK VELVET IN HER HAIR
7749-8591-0014 EATING ALMONDS AND APRICOTS FROM THE TREES WATCHING THE WOMEN AT THE COMMUNAL WASHING FOUNTAINS UNDER THE DARK PLANE TREES
7749-8591-0015 AND VERCINGETORIX AND DANTE AND TRYING TO LEARN PROVENCAL
7749-8591-0016 THAT HE'D NEVER HAVE LOOKED AT IF IT HAD BEEN IN ENGLISH WELL WE GOT TO DARBISSON WE'D RUN ACROSS SOME YOUNG CHAP OR OTHER RANGON HIS NAME WAS WHO WAS A VINE PLANTER IN THOSE PARTS AND RANGON
7749-8591-0017 HAD ASKED US TO SPEND A COUPLE OF DAYS WITH HIM WITH HIM AND HIS MOTHER IF WE HAPPENED TO BE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD SO AS WE MIGHT AS WELL HAPPEN TO BE THERE AS ANYWHERE ELSE WE SENT HIM A POSTCARD AND WENT
7749-8591-0018 OF VELVETY CYPRESSES SIXTY FEET HIGH ALL WHITE WITH DUST ON THE NORTH SIDE OF EM FOR THE MISTRAL WAS HAVING ITS THREE DAYS REVEL
7749-8591-0019 WERE BOWED NEARLY TO THE EARTH A ROARING DAY IT WAS I REMEMBER BUT THE WIND FELL A LITTLE LATE IN THE AFTERNOON AND WE WERE PORING OVER WHAT IT HAD LEFT OF OUR ORDNANCE SURVEY LIKE FOOLS WE'D GOT
7749-8591-0020 THE UNMOUNTED PAPER MAPS INSTEAD OF THE LINEN ONES WHEN RANGON HIMSELF FOUND US COMING OUT TO MEET US IN A VERY BADLY TURNED OUT TRAP
7749-8591-0021 WHERE HE LIVED WITH HIS MOTHER HE SPOKE NO ENGLISH
7749-8591-0022 BEG ITS PARDON THE LANGUAGE THOUGH THERE'S A GOOD DEAL OF MY EYE AND BETTY MARTIN ABOUT THAT AND I FANCY THIS FELIBRIGE BUSINESS WILL BE IN A GOOD MANY PIECES WHEN FREDERIC MISTRAL IS UNDER THAT COURT OF LOVE PAVILION ARRANGEMENT HE'S HAD
7749-8591-0023 AND WHILE I PERSONALLY DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT A KICK I RATHER SYMPATHISE WITH THE GOVERNMENT
7749-8591-0024 BUT BUT THAT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH MY TALE AFTER ALL SO HE DROVE ON AND BY THE TIME WE GOT TO RANGON'S HOUSE CARROLL HAD LEARNED THE GREATER PART OF MAGALI AS YOU NO DOUBT KNOW IT'S A RESTRICTED SORT OF LIFE IN SOME RESPECTS THAT A YOUNG
7749-8591-0025 LIVES IN THOSE PARTS AND IT WAS AS WE REACHED THE HOUSE THAT RANGON REMEMBERED SOMETHING
7749-8591-0026 AND NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET A WORD IN EDGEWAYS FOR CARROLL
7749-8591-0027 THAT HIS MOTHER WAS AWAY FROM HOME FOR SOME DAYS APOLOGIES OF THE MOST PROFOUND OF COURSE OUR HOST WAS THE SOUL OF COURTESY THOUGH HE DID TRY TO GET AT US A BIT LATER WE EXPRESSED OUR POLITE REGRETS
7749-8591-0028 NATURALLY BUT I DIDN'T QUITE SEE AT FIRST WHAT DIFFERENCE IT MADE
7749-8591-0029 IT APPEARED THAT WHEN MADAME RANGON WENT AWAY FOR A FEW DAYS SHE DISPERSED THE WHOLE OF THE FEMALE SIDE OF HER ESTABLISHMENT ALSO
7749-8591-0030 THEY CLAP ACROSS THE HORSE'S BACK AND DRIVE BETWEEN THE ROWS OF VINES
7749-8591-0031 AN APERITIF A HALL CROWDED WITH OAK FURNITURE AND PHOTOGRAPHS AND A CRADLE LIKE BREAD CRIB AND DOORS OPENING TO RIGHT AND LEFT TO THE OTHER ROOMS OF THE GROUND FLOOR HE HAD ALSO IT
7749-8591-0032 OUR POSTCARD HAD COME UNEXPECTEDLY HE SAID AND ALREADY HE HAD MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH HIS AGENT ABOUT
7749-8591-0033 WE BEGGED HIM OF COURSE NOT TO ALLOW US TO INTERFERE WITH HIS BUSINESS IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE HE THANKED US A THOUSAND TIMES BUT THOUGH WE DINE IN THE VILLAGE WE WILL TAKE OUR OWN WINE WITH US HE SAID A WINE SURFIN ONE OF MY WINES YOU SHALL SEE
7749-8591-0034 THEN HE SHOWED US ROUND HIS PLACE I FORGET HOW MANY HUNDREDS OF ACRES OF VINES AND INTO THE GREAT BUILDING WITH THE PRESSES AND PUMPS AND CASKS AND THE HUGE BARREL THEY CALL THE THUNDERBOLT AND ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK WE WALKED BACK TO DARBISSON TO DINNER CARRYING OUR WINE WITH US
7749-8591-0035 I THINK THE RESTAURANT WE DINED IN WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE PLACE AND OUR GAILLARD OF A HOST HE WAS A STRAIGHT BACKED WELL SET UP CHAP WITH RATHER FINE EYES DID US ON THE WHOLE PRETTY WELL HIS WINE CERTAINLY WAS GOOD STUFF AND SET OUR TONGUES GOING
7749-8591-0036 A MOMENT AGO I SAID A FELLOW LIKE RANGON LEADS A RESTRICTED SORT OF LIFE IN THOSE PARTS I SAW THIS MORE CLEARLY AS DINNER WENT ON WE DINED BY AN OPEN WINDOW FROM WHICH WE COULD SEE THE STREAM WITH THE PLANKS ACROSS IT
7749-8591-0037 THERE WERE A DOZEN OR SO OF THEM THERE AS WE DINED LAUGHING AND CHATTING IN LOW TONES THEY ALL SEEMED PRETTY IT WAS QUICKLY FALLING DUSK ALL THE GIRLS ARE PRETTY THEN AND ARE QUITE CONSCIOUS OF IT YOU KNOW MARSHAM
7749-8591-0038 BEHIND THEM AT THE END OF THE STREET ONE OF THESE GREAT CYPRESS WIND SCREENS SHOWED BLACK AGAINST THE SKY
7749-8591-0039 AND YOU COULD ONLY TELL WHETHER THEY WERE MEN OR WOMEN UNDER THE PLANTAINS BY THEIR VOICES RIPPLING AND CHATTERING AND SUDDENLY A DEEPER NOTE ONCE I HEARD A MUFFLED SCUFFLE AND A SOUND LIKE A KISS IT WAS THEN THAT RANGON'S LITTLE TROUBLE CAME OUT
7749-8591-0040 IT SEEMED THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW ANY GIRLS
7749-8591-0041 THE GIRLS OF THE VILLAGE WERE PRETTY ENOUGH BUT YOU SEE HOW IT WAS
7749-8591-0042 AND AS SOON AS CARROLL GAVE HIM A CHANCE HE BEGAN TO ASK US QUESTIONS ABOUT ENGLAND ENGLISH GIRLS THE LIBERTY THEY HAD AND SO ON OF COURSE WE COULDN'T TELL HIM MUCH HE HADN'T HEARD ALREADY
7749-8591-0043 SOIREE HE HAD ALL THE LATER PREVOSTS IN HIS ROOM HE TOLD US
7749-8591-0044 BETWEEN THEM MUST BE PLAYING THE MISCHIEF WITH THE
7749-8591-0045 AND OUR YOUNG MAN WAS WHAT
7749-8591-0046 CO EDUCATIONALIST BY JOVE YES HE SEEMED TO MARVEL THAT WE SHOULD HAVE LEFT A COUNTRY SO BLESSED AS ENGLAND TO VISIT HIS DUSTY WILD LAVENDER SMELLING GIRL LESS PROVENCE YOU DON'T KNOW HALF YOUR LUCK MARSHAM
7749-8591-0047 WELL WE TALKED AFTER THIS FASHION WE'D LEFT THE DINING ROOM OF THE RESTAURANT AND HAD PLANTED OURSELVES ON A BENCH OUTSIDE WITH RANGON BETWEEN US WHEN RANGON SUDDENLY LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND SAID IT WAS TIME
7749-8591-0048 HE ASKED US AND MEET HIM AGAIN THERE HE SAID BUT AS HIS AGENT LIVED IN THE DIRECTION OF HIS OWN HOME
7749-8591-0049 ENVYING EVERY ENGLISHMAN WHO STEPPED I DON'T DOUBT
7749-8591-0050 SAYS THAT ENGLISHMEN DON'T TRAVEL TO SEE ENGLISHMEN I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE'D STAND TO THAT IN THE CASE OF ENGLISHWOMEN CARROLL AND I DIDN'T
7749-8591-0051 DID SO AND RECEIVED SOME NAME IN RETURN WHICH STRANGELY ENOUGH I'VE ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN I ONLY REMEMBER THAT THE LADIES WERE AUNT AND NIECE AND LIVED AT DARBISSON THEY SHOOK THEIR HEADS WHEN I MENTIONED M RANGON'S NAME AND SAID
7749-8591-0052 WE WERE VISITING HIM THEY DIDN'T KNOW HIM I'D NEVER BEEN IN DARBISSON BEFORE AND I HAVEN'T BEEN SINCE SO I DON'T KNOW THE MAP OF THE VILLAGE VERY WELL BUT THE PLACE ISN'T VERY BIG AND THE HOUSE AT WHICH WE STOPPED IN TWENTY MINUTES OR SO IS PROBABLY THERE YET
7749-8591-0053 IT HAD A LARGE DOUBLE DOOR A DOUBLE DOOR IN TWO SENSES FOR IT WAS A BIG
7749-8591-0054 WITH A SMALLER DOOR INSIDE IT AND AN IRON GRILLE SHUTTING IN THE WHOLE THE GENTLE VOICED OLD LADY HAD ALREADY TAKEN A KEY FROM HER RETICULE AND WAS THANKING US AGAIN FOR THE LITTLE SERVICE OF THE HANDKERCHIEF THEN WITH THE LITTLE GESTURE ONE MAKES WHEN
7749-8591-0055 ONE HAS FOUND ONESELF ON THE POINT OF OMITTING A COURTESY SHE GAVE A LITTLE MUSICAL LAUGH BUT SHE SAID WITH A LITTLE MOVEMENT OF INVITATION ONE SEES SO FEW COMPATRIOTS HERE IF YOU HAVE THE TIME TO COME IN AND SMOKE A CIGARETTE
7749-8591-0056 ALSO THE CIGARETTE SHE ADDED
7749-8591-0057 AND LIVE ALONE HASTILY AS I WAS ABOUT TO ACCEPT CARROLL WAS BEFORE ME PROFESSING A NOSTALGIA FOR THE SOUND OF THE ENGLISH TONGUE THAT MADE HIS RECENT PROTESTATIONS ABOUT PROVENCAL A SHAMELESS HYPOCRISY
7749-8591-0058 PERSUASIVE YOUNG RASCAL CARROLL WAS POOR CHAP SO THE ELDER LADY OPENED THE GRILLE AND THE WOODEN DOOR BEYOND IT AND WE ENTERED BY THE LIGHT OF THE CANDLE WHICH THE YOUNGER LADY TOOK FROM A BRACKET JUST WITHIN THE DOOR
7749-8591-0059 WE SAW THAT WE WERE IN A HANDSOME HALL OR VESTIBULE AND MY WONDER THAT RANGON HAD MADE NO MENTION OF WHAT WAS APPARENTLY A CONSIDERABLE ESTABLISHMENT WAS INCREASED BY THE FACT THAT ITS TENANTS
7749-8591-0060 MUST BE KNOWN TO BE ENGLISH AND COULD BE SEEN TO BE ENTIRELY CHARMING I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT AND I'M AFRAID HYPOTHESES RUSHED INTO MY HEAD THAT CAST DOUBTS ON THE RANGONS YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY WERE ALL RIGHT WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT OUR YOUNG PLANTER YOU SEE
7749-8591-0061 I LOOKED ABOUT ME THERE WERE TUBS HERE AND THERE AGAINST THE WALLS GAILY PAINTED WITH GLOSSY LEAVED ALOES AND PALMS IN THEM ONE OF THE ALOES I REMEMBER WAS FLOWERING A LITTLE FOUNTAIN IN THE MIDDLE MADE
7749-8591-0062 A TINKLING NOISE WE PUT OUR CAPS ON A CARVED AND GILT CONSOLE TABLE
7749-8591-0063 AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE WERE MORE PALMS AND ALOES AND DOUBLE DOORS PAINTED IN A CLEAR GREY WE FOLLOWED OUR HOSTESSES UP THE STAIRCASE I CAN HEAR YET THE SHARP CLEAN CLICK OUR BOOTS MADE
7749-8591-0064 ON THAT HARD SHINY STONE SEE THE LIGHTS OF THE CANDLE GLEAMING ON THE HANDRAIL THE YOUNG GIRL SHE WAS NOT MUCH MORE THAN A GIRL PUSHED AT THE DOORS AND WE WENT IN THE ROOM WE ENTERED
7749-8591-0065 WITH THE REST FOR RATHER OLD FASHIONED FINENESS IT WAS LARGE LOFTY BEAUTIFULLY KEPT CARROLL WENT ROUND FOR MISS WHATEVER HER NAME WAS LIGHTING CANDLES IN SCONCES AND AS THE FLAMES CREPT UP THEY GLIMMERED ON A BEAUTIFULLY POLISHED FLOOR
7749-8591-0066 WHICH WAS BARE EXCEPT FOR AN EASTERN RUG HERE AND THERE THE ELDER LADY HAD SAT DOWN IN A GILT CHAIR LOUIS FOURTEENTH I SHOULD SAY WITH A STRIPED REP OF THE COLOUR OF A PETUNIA
7749-8591-0067 AND I REALLY DON'T KNOW DON'T SMILE SMITH WHAT INDUCED ME TO LEAD HER TO IT BY THE FINGER TIPS BENDING OVER HER HAND FOR A MOMENT AS SHE SAT DOWN
7749-8591-0068 THERE WAS AN OLD TAMBOUR FRAME BEHIND HER CHAIR I REMEMBER AND A VAST OVAL MIRROR WITH CLUSTERED CANDLE BRACKETS FILLED THE GREATER PART OF THE FARTHER WALL THE BRIGHTEST AND CLEAREST GLASS I'VE EVER SEEN
7749-8591-0069 HE PAUSED LOOKING AT MY CIGARETTE CASE WHICH HE HAD TAKEN INTO HIS HAND AGAIN HE SMILED AT SOME RECOLLECTION OR OTHER AND IT WAS A MINUTE OR SO BEFORE HE CONTINUED
7749-8591-0070 I MUST ADMIT THAT I FOUND IT A LITTLE ANNOYING AFTER WHAT WE'D BEEN TALKING ABOUT AT DINNER AN HOUR BEFORE THAT RANGON WASN'T WITH US I STILL COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW HE COULD HAVE NEIGHBOURS SO CHARMING WITHOUT KNOWING ABOUT THEM
7749-8591-0071 BUT I DIDN'T CARE TO INSIST ON THIS TO THE OLD LADY WHO FOR ALL I KNEW MIGHT HAVE HER OWN REASONS FOR KEEPING TO HERSELF AND AFTER ALL IT WAS OUR PLACE TO RETURN RANGON'S HOSPITALITY IN LONDON
7749-8591-0072 SO TO SPEAK ON HIS OWN DOORSTEP SO PRESENTLY I FORGOT ALL ABOUT RANGON AND I'M PRETTY SURE THAT CARROLL WHO WAS TALKING TO HIS COMPANION OF SOME
7749-8591-0073 DIDN'T WASTE A THOUGHT ON HIM EITHER SOON CARROLL YOU REMEMBER WHAT A PRETTY CROONING HUMMING VOICE HE HAD SOON CARROLL WAS MURMURING WHAT THEY CALL SECONDS BUT SO LOW THAT THE SOUND HARDLY CAME ACROSS THE ROOM
7749-8591-0074 AND I CAME IN WITH A SOFT BASS NOTE FROM TIME TO TIME NO INSTRUMENT YOU KNOW JUST AN UNACCOMPANIED MURMUR NO LOUDER THAN AN AEOLIAN HARP AND IT SOUNDED INFINITELY SWEET AND PLAINTIVE
7749-8591-0075 YOU MIGHT ALMOST SAY IN THAT FORMAL RATHER OLD FASHIONED SALON
7749-8591-0076 OUTSIDE THE WIND HAD NOW FALLEN COMPLETELY ALL WAS VERY QUIET AND SUDDENLY IN A VOICE NOT MUCH LOUDER THAN A SIGH CARROLL'S COMPANION WAS SINGING OFT IN THE STILLY NIGHT YOU KNOW IT
7749-8591-0077 HE WENT ON AGAIN WELL I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO CONVINCE YOU OF SUCH A SPECIAL AND DELICATE THING AS THE CHARM OF THAT HOUR IT WASN'T MORE THAN AN HOUR IT
7749-8591-0078 WOULD BE ALL ABOUT AN HOUR WE STAYED THINGS LIKE THAT JUST HAVE TO BE SAID AND LEFT YOU DESTROY THEM THE MOMENT YOU BEGIN TO INSIST ON THEM WE'VE EVERY ONE OF US HAD EXPERIENCES LIKE THAT
7749-8591-0079 AND DON'T SAY MUCH ABOUT THEM I WAS AS MUCH IN LOVE WITH MY OLD LADY AS CARROLL EVIDENTLY WAS WITH HIS YOUNG ONE I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY BEING IN LOVE HAS JUST TO BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED TOO
7749-8591-0080 I SUPPOSE MARSHAM UNDERSTANDS WE SMOKED OUR CIGARETTES AND SANG AGAIN ONCE MORE FILLING THAT CLEAR PAINTED QUIET APARTMENT WITH A MURMURING NO LOUDER THAN IF A LIGHT BREEZE
7749-8591-0081 BY THE SIDE OF HER CHAIR OH INFINITELY PRETTY IT WAS THEN CARROLL WANDERED OFF INTO THE QUE CANTES AWFULLY PRETTY IS NOT FOR MYSELF I SING BUT FOR MY FRIEND WHO IS NEAR M E AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW LIKE FOUR OLD FRIENDS WE WERE
7749-8591-0082 BUT FOR ALL THE SWEETNESS AND THE GLAMOUR OF IT WE COULDN'T STAY ON INDEFINITELY AND I WONDERED WHAT TIME IT WAS BUT DIDN'T ASK ANYTHING TO DO WITH CLOCKS AND WATCHES
7749-8591-0083 AND WHEN PRESENTLY WE BOTH GOT UP NEITHER CARROLL NOR I ASKED TO BE ALLOWED TO CALL AGAIN IN THE MORNING TO THANK THEM FOR A CHARMING HOUR AND THEY SEEMED TO FEEL THE SAME AS WE DID ABOUT IT THERE WAS NO HOPING
7749-8591-0084 THAT WE SHOULD MEET AGAIN IN LONDON' NEITHER AN AU REVOIR NOR A GOOD BYE JUST A TACIT UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT HOUR SHOULD REMAIN ISOLATED ACCEPTED LIKE A GOOD GIFT WITHOUT LOOKING THE GIFT HORSE IN THE MOUTH
7749-8591-0085 SINGLE UNATTACHED TO ANY HOURS BEFORE OR AFTER I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN GIVE ME A MATCH SOMEBODY AND SO WE LEFT WITH NO MORE THAN LOOKS EXCHANGED AND FINGER TIPS RESTING BETWEEN THE BACK OF OUR HANDS
7749-8591-0086 AND OUR LIPS FOR A MOMENT WE FOUND OUR WAY OUT BY OURSELVES DOWN THAT SHALLOW STEPPED STAIRCASE WITH THE HANDSOME HANDRAIL AND LET OURSELVES OUT OF THE DOUBLE DOOR AND GRILLE CLOSING IT SOFTLY WE MADE FOR THE VILLAGE WITHOUT SPEAKING A WORD
7749-8591-0087 HEIGHO LODER HAD PICKED UP THE CIGARETTE CASE AGAIN BUT FOR ALL THE WAY HIS EYES RESTED ON IT I DOUBT WHETHER HE REALLY SAW IT I'M PRETTY SURE HE DIDN'T I KNEW WHEN HE DID BY THE GLANCE HE SHOT AT ME
7749-8591-0088 AS MUCH AS TO SAY I SEE YOU'RE WONDERING WHERE THE CIGARETTE CASE COMES IN
7749-8591-0089 WELL HE CONTINUED WE GOT BACK TO RANGON'S HOUSE I REALLY DON'T BLAME RANGON FOR THE WAY HE TOOK IT WHEN
7749-8591-0090 YOU KNOW HE THOUGHT WE WERE PULLING HIS LEG OF COURSE AND HE WASN'T HAVING ANY NOT HE THERE WERE NO ENGLISH LADIES IN DARBISSON HE SAID WE TOLD HIM AS NEARLY AS WE COULD JUST WHERE THE HOUSE WAS WE WEREN'T VERY PRECISE I'M AFRAID
7749-8591-0091 FOR THE VILLAGE HAD BEEN IN DARKNESS AS WE HAD COME THROUGH IT AND I HAD TO ADMIT THAT THE CYPRESS HEDGE I TRIED TO DESCRIBE WHERE WE'D MET OUR FRIENDS WAS A GOOD DEAL LIKE OTHER CYPRESS HEDGES AND AS I SAY RANGON WASN'T TAKING ANY
7749-8591-0092 I MYSELF WAS RATHER ANNOYED THAT HE SHOULD THINK WE WERE RETURNING HIS HOSPITALITY BY TRYING TO GET AT HIM AND IT WASN'T VERY EASY EITHER TO EXPLAIN IN MY FRENCH
7749-8591-0093 THAT WE WERE GOING TO LET THE THING STAND AS IT WAS AND WEREN'T GOING TO CALL ON OUR CHARMING FRIENDS AGAIN
7749-8591-0094 I KNEW IT WAS GOOD MY WINE HE SAID BUT
7749-8591-0095 NO HE REPLIED THINK YOU LEFT IT BEHIND AT THAT PLACE LAST NIGHT YES DID YOU RANGON POPPED IN WITH A TWINKLE I WENT THROUGH ALL MY POCKETS AGAIN NO CIGARETTE CASE
7749-8591-0096 OF COURSE IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT I'D LEFT IT BEHIND AND I WAS ANNOYED AGAIN I DIDN'T WANT TO GO BACK YOU SEE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE THE CASE IT WAS A PRESENT AND RANGON'S SMILE NETTLED ME A GOOD DEAL TOO
7749-8591-0097 MIGHT HAVE DONE I GRUNTED WELL IN THAT CASE WE'LL GO AND GET IT IF ONE TRIED THE RESTAURANT FIRST RANGON SUGGESTED SMILING AGAIN
7749-8591-0098 THOUGH I REMEMBERED HAVING THE CASE AFTER WE'D LEFT THE RESTAURANT
7749-8591-0099 I'D KNOWN JOLLY WELL BEFOREHAND IT WASN'T AND I SAW RANGON'S MOUTH TWITCHING WITH AMUSEMENT SO WE NOW SEEK THE ABODE
7749-8591-0100 HEIN HE SAID YES SAID I AND WE LEFT THE RESTAURANT AND STRODE THROUGH THE VILLAGE BY THE WAY WE'D TAKEN THE EVENING BEFORE THAT
7749-8591-0101 IT IS THEN THE NEXT VILLAGE
7749-8591-0102 AS WE LEFT THE LAST HOUSE AND CAME OUT INTO THE OPEN PLAIN WE WENT BACK I WAS IRRITATED BECAUSE WE WERE TWO TO ONE YOU SEE AND CARROLL BACKED ME UP A DOUBLE DOOR WITH A GRILLE IN FRONT OF IT
7749-8591-0103 HE REPEATED FOR THE FIFTIETH TIME RANGON MERELY REPLIED THAT IT WASN'T OUR GOOD FAITH HE DOUBTED HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY USE THE WORD DRUNK MAIS TIENS HE SAID SUDDENLY TRYING TO CONCEAL HIS MIRTH
7749-8591-0104 OF THESE SO ELUSIVE LADIES COME THIS WAY HE TOOK US BACK ALONG A PLANTAIN GROVED STREET AND SUDDENLY TURNED UP AN ALLEY THAT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN TWO GUTTERS AND A CRACK OF SKY OVERHEAD BETWEEN TWO BROKEN TILED ROOFS IT WAS A
7749-8591-0105 AND I WAS POSITIVELY ANGRY
7749-8591-0106 WITH A HALF UNHINGED RAILING IN FRONT OF IT IS IT THAT YOUR HOUSE HE ASKED NO SAYS I AND NO SAYS CARROLL AND OFF WE STARTED AGAIN BUT ANOTHER HALF HOUR BROUGHT US BACK TO THE SAME PLACE AND CARROLL SCRATCHED HIS HEAD
7749-8591-0107 NOBODY SAYS RANGON AS MUCH AS TO SAY LOOK AT IT
7749-8591-0108 THEN MEDITATES TAKING IT THEN I STRUCK IN QUITE OUT OF TEMPER BY THIS TIME HOW MUCH WOULD THE RENT BE I ASKED AS IF I REALLY THOUGHT OF TAKING THE PLACE JUST TO GET BACK AT HIM
7749-8591-0109 HE MENTIONED SOMETHING RIDICULOUSLY SMALL IN THE WAY OF FRANCS ONE MIGHT AT LEAST SEE THE PLACE SAYS I CAN THE KEY BE GOT
7749-8591-0110 BAKER'S NOT A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY HE SAID WE GOT THE KEY IT WAS THE KEY OF THE INNER WOODEN DOOR THAT GRID OF RUSTY IRON DIDN'T NEED ONE
7749-8591-0111 IT CAME CLEAN OFF ITS SINGLE HINGE WHEN CARROLL TOUCHED IT CARROLL OPENED AND WE STOOD FOR A MOMENT MOTIONING TO ONE ANOTHER TO STEP IN THEN RANGON WENT IN FIRST AND I HEARD HIM MURMUR PARDON
7749-8591-0112 NOW THIS IS THE ODD PART WE PASSED INTO A SORT OF VESTIBULE OR HALL WITH A BURST LEAD PIPE IN THE MIDDLE OF A DRY TANK IN THE CENTRE OF IT THERE WAS A BROAD STAIRCASE RISING IN FRONT OF US TO THE FIRST FLOOR AND DOUBLE DOORS JUST SEEN IN THE HALF LIGHT
7749-8591-0113 AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS OLD TUBS STOOD AGAINST THE WALLS BUT THE PALMS AND ALOES IN THEM WERE DEAD ONLY A CABBAGE STALK OR TWO AND THE RUSTY HOOPS LAY ON THE GROUND ABOUT THEM ONE TUB HAD COME TO PIECES ENTIRELY
7749-8591-0114 AND WAS NO MORE THAN A HEAP OF STAVES ON A PILE OF SPILT EARTH AND EVERYWHERE EVERYWHERE WAS DUST THE FLOOR WAS AN INCH DEEP IN DUST AND OLD PLASTER THAT MUFFLED OUR FOOTSTEPS COBWEBS HUNG LIKE OLD DUSTERS ON THE WALLS
7749-8591-0115 A REGULAR GOBLIN'S TATTER OF COBWEBS DRAPED THE LITTLE BRACKET INSIDE THE DOOR AND THE WROUGHT IRON OF THE HAND RAIL WAS CLOSED UP WITH WEBS IN WHICH NOT EVEN A SPIDER MOVED THE WHOLE THING WAS PREPOSTEROUS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FOR EVEN A LESS RENTAL
7749-8591-0116 COME UPSTAIRS SAID I SUDDENLY UP WE WENT
7749-8591-0117 AND I HAD TO STRIKE A STINKING FRENCH SULPHUR MATCH TO SEE INTO THE ROOM AT ALL UNDERFOOT WAS LIKE WALKING ON THICKNESSES OF FLANNEL AND EXCEPT WHERE WE PUT OUR FEET THE PLACE WAS AS PRINTLESS
7749-8591-0118 AS A SNOWFIELD DUST DUST UNBROKEN GREY DUST MY MATCH BURNED DOWN
7749-8591-0119 WITH NEVER A CANDLE END IN THEM THERE WAS THE LARGE OVAL MIRROR BUT HARDLY REFLECTING CARROLL'S MATCH FOR
7749-8591-0120 BUT SUDDENLY I DARTED FORWARD SOMETHING NEW AND BRIGHT ON THE TABLE TWINKLED WITH THE LIGHT OF CARROLL'S MATCH THE MATCH WENT OUT AND BY THE TIME CARROLL HAD LIGHTED ANOTHER I HAD STOPPED I WANTED RANGON TO SEE WHAT WAS ON THE TABLE
7749-8591-0121 WILL YOU PICK IT UP AND RANGON STEPPING FORWARD PICKED UP FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE MY CIGARETTE CASE LODER HAD FINISHED
7749-8591-0122 NOBODY SPOKE FOR QUITE A MINUTE NOBODY SPOKE AND THEN LODER HIMSELF BROKE THE SILENCE TURNING TO ME MAKE ANYTHING OF IT HE SAID I LIFTED MY EYEBROWS ONLY YOUR VIGNERON'S EXPLANATION I BEGAN BUT
7749-8591-0123 STOPPED AGAIN SEEING THAT WOULDN'T DO ANY BODY MAKE ANYTHING OF IT SAID LODER TURNING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER I GATHERED FROM SMITH'S FACE THAT HE THOUGHT ONE THING MIGHT BE MADE OF IT NAMELY THAT LODER HAD INVENTED THE WHOLE TALE
7749-8591-0124 BUT EVEN SMITH DIDN'T SPEAK WERE ANY ENGLISH LADIES EVER FOUND TO HAVE LIVED IN THE PLACE MURDERED YOU KNOW BODIES FOUND AND ALL THAT
7749-8591-0125 YOUNG MARSHAM ASKED DIFFIDENTLY YEARNING FOR AN OBVIOUS COMPLETENESS NOT THAT WE COULD EVER LEARN LODER REPLIED WE MADE INQUIRIES TOO SO YOU ALL GIVE IT UP
7749-8591-0126 HE WALKED TO THE DOOR MYSELF FOLLOWING HIM TO GET HIS HAT AND STICK I HEARD HIM HUMMING SOFTLY THE LINES THEY ARE FROM OFT IN THE STILLY NIGHT
