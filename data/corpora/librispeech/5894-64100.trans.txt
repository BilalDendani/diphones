5894-64100-0000 THE INVITED TO THE ARCHERY MEETING HAVE NEARLY ALL ARRIVED AND THE SHOOTING HAS COMMENCED HALF A DOZEN ARROWS IN THE AIR AT A TIME MAKING FOR AS MANY TARGETS ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF LADIES COMPETE FOR THE FIRST SCORE
5894-64100-0001 EACH HAVING A LITTLE COTERIE OF ACQUAINTANCES AT HER BACK GWEN WYNN HERSELF IS IN THIS OPENING CONTEST GOOD WITH THE BOW AS AT THE OAR INDEED WITH COUNTY CELEBRITY AS AN ARCHER CARRYING THE CHAMPION BADGE OF HER CLUB
5894-64100-0002 IT IS ALMOST A FOREGONE CONCLUSION SHE WILL COME OFF VICTORIOUS SOON HOWEVER THOSE WHO ARE BACKING HER BEGIN TO ANTICIPATE DISAPPOINTMENT SHE IS NOT SHOOTING WITH HER USUAL SKILL NOR YET EARNESTNESS
5894-64100-0003 INSTEAD NEGLIGENTLY AND TO ALL APPEARANCE WITH THOUGHTS ABSTRACTED HER EYES EVERY NOW AND THEN STRAYING OVER THE GROUND SCANNING THE VARIOUS GROUPS AS IF IN SEARCH OF A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL THE GATHERING IS LARGE NEARLY A HUNDRED PEOPLE PRESENT
5894-64100-0004 AND ONE MIGHT COME OR GO WITHOUT ATTRACTING OBSERVATION SHE EVIDENTLY EXPECTS ONE TO COME WHO IS NOT YET THERE AND OFTENER THAN ELSEWHERE HER GLANCES GO TOWARDS THE BOAT DOCK AS IF THE PERSONAGE EXPECTED SHOULD APPEAR IN THAT DIRECTION
5894-64100-0005 THERE IS A NERVOUS RESTLESSNESS IN HER MANNER AND AFTER EACH RECONNAISSANCE OF THIS KIND AN EXPRESSION OF DISAPPOINTMENT ON HER COUNTENANCE IT IS NOT UNOBSERVED A GENTLEMAN BY HER SIDE NOTES IT AND WITH SOME SUSPICION OF ITS CAUSE
5894-64100-0006 A SUSPICION THAT PAINS HIM IT IS GEORGE SHENSTONE WHO IS ATTENDING ON HER HANDING THE ARROWS IN SHORT ACTING AS HER AIDE DE CAMP NEITHER IS HE ADROIT IN THE EXERCISE OF HIS DUTY INSTEAD PERFORMS IT BUNGLINGLY
5894-64100-0007 HIS THOUGHTS PREOCCUPIED AND EYES WANDERING ABOUT HIS GLANCES HOWEVER ARE SENT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO THE GATE ENTRANCE OF THE PARK VISIBLE FROM THE PLACE WHERE THE TARGETS ARE SET UP
5894-64100-0008 BUT WITH VERY DIFFERENT IDEAS ONE EAGERLY ANTICIPATING HIS ARRIVAL THE OTHER AS EARNESTLY HOPING HE MAY NOT COME FOR THE EXPECTED ONE IS A GENTLEMAN NO OTHER THAN VIVIAN RYECROFT
5894-64100-0009 SHENSTONE KNOWS THE HUSSAR OFFICER HAS BEEN INVITED AND HOWEVER HOPING OR WISHING IT HAS BUT LITTLE FAITH HE WILL FAIL WERE IT HIMSELF NO ORDINARY OBSTACLE COULD PREVENT HIS BEING PRESENT AT THAT ARCHERY MEETING
5894-64100-0010 ANY MORE THAN WOULD FIVE BARRED GATE OR BULLFINCH HINDER HIM FROM KEEPING UP WITH HOUNDS AS TIME PASSES WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ARRIVALS AND THE TARDY GUEST HAS NOT YET PUT IN APPEARANCE SHENSTONE BEGINS TO THINK HE WILL THIS DAY HAVE MISS WYNN TO HIMSELF
5894-64100-0011 THERE ARE OTHERS PRESENT WHO SEEK HER SMILES SOME ASPIRING TO HER HAND BUT NONE HE FEARS SO MUCH AS THE ONE STILL ABSENT JUST AS HE IS BECOMING CALM AND CONFIDENT HE IS SALUTED BY A GENTLEMAN OF THE GENUS SWELL WHO APPROACHING
5894-64100-0012 WHO IS THAT FELLA SHENSTONE WHAT FELLOW
5894-64100-0013 INDIAN AFFAIR TOPEE I BEWIEVE THEY CALL IT WHERE ASKS SHENSTONE STARTING AND STARING TO ALL SIDES YONDAW APPWOACHING FROM THE DIWECTION OF THE RIVAW LOOKS A FWESH AWIVAL
5894-64100-0014 I TAKE IT HE MUST HAVE COME BY BAWT
5894-64100-0015 GEORGE SHENSTONE STRONG MAN THOUGH HE BE VISIBLY TREMBLES WERE GWEN WYNN AT THAT MOMENT TO FACE ABOUT AND AIM ONE OF HER ARROWS AT HIS BREAST IT WOULD NOT BRING MORE PALLOR UPON HIS CHEEKS NOR PAIN TO HIS HEART
5894-64100-0016 FOR HE WEARING THE PECULYA HEAD GEAR IS THE MAN HE MOST FEARS AND WHOM HE HAD HOPED NOT TO SEE THIS DAY SO MUCH IS HE AFFECTED HE DOES NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION PUT TO HIM
5894-64100-0017 NOR INDEED HAS HE OPPORTUNITY AS JUST THEN MISS WYNN SIGHTING THE TOPEE TOO SUDDENLY TURNING SAYS TO HIM GEORGE BE GOOD ENOUGH TO TAKE CHARGE OF THESE THINGS SHE HOLDS HER BOW WITH AN ARROW SHE HAD BEEN AFFIXING TO THE STRING
5894-64100-0018 IN HIS EYES ANYTHING BUT A PLEASED EXPRESSION INDEED SULLEN ALMOST ANGRY AS WATCHING HER EVERY MOVEMENT HE NOTES THE MANNER OF HER RECEPTION GREETING THE NEW COMER WITH A WARMTH AND CORDIALITY HE SHENSTONE THINKS UNCALLED FOR
5894-64100-0019 HOWEVER MUCH STRANGER THE MAN MAY BE LITTLE IRKSOME TO HER SEEMS THE DISCHARGE OF THAT SO CALLED DUTY BUT SO EXASPERATING TO THE BARONET'S SON HE FEELS LIKE CRUSHING THE BOW STICK BETWEEN HIS FINGERS OR SNAPPING IT IN TWAIN ACROSS HIS KNEE
5894-64100-0020 AS HE STANDS WITH EYES GLARING UPON THEM HE IS AGAIN ACCOSTED BY HIS INQUISITIVE ACQUAINTANCE WHO ASKS WHAT'S THE MATTER JAWGE YAW HAVEN'T ANSWERED MY INTEWOGATOWY WHAT WAS IT I FORGET
5894-64100-0021 JUST WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW MYSELF ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT HE'S AN ARMY FELLOW IN THE CAVALRY I BELIEVE BY NAME RYECROFT
5894-64100-0022 BUT YAW DON'T THINK HE'S AN ADVENTUWER CAN'T SAY WHETHER HE IS OR NOT WHO'S HIS ENDAWSER HOW CAME HE INTWODUCED AT LLANGOWEN THAT I CAN'T TELL YOU HE COULD THOUGH
5894-64100-0023 FOR MISS WYNN TRUE TO HER PROMISE HAS MADE HIM ACQUAINTED WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE RIVER ADVENTURE THOUGH NOT THOSE LEADING TO IT AND HE TRUE TO HIS HAS KEPT THEM A SECRET IN A SENSE THEREFORE HE COULD NOT TELL AND THE SUBTERFUGE IS EXCUSABLE
5894-64100-0024 LIKE A QUEEN OF THE TAWNAMENT TIMES
5894-64100-0025 INSTEAD VERY MODERN IN MY OPINION DISGUSTINGLY SO WHY D'Y AW SAY THAT JAWGE WHY BECAUSE IN EITHER OLDEN OR MEDIAEVAL TIMES SUCH A THING COULDN'T HAVE OCCURRED HERE IN HEREFORDSHIRE
5894-64100-0026 NOW A DAYS ANY ONE MAY BE SO CLAIM ACQUAINTANCE WITH A LADY AND FORCE HIS COMPANY UPON HER SIMPLY FROM HAVING HAD THE CHANCE TO PICK UP A DROPPED POCKET HANDKERCHIEF OR OFFER HIS UMBRELLA IN A SKIFF OF A SHOWER
5894-64100-0027 BUT SHAWLY THAT ISN'T HOW THE GENTLEMAN YONDAW MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE FAIR GWENDOLINE OH I DON'T SAY THAT REJOINS SHENSTONE WITH FORCED ATTEMPT AT A SMILE MORE NATURAL AS HE SEES MISS WYNN SEPARATE FROM THE GROUP THEY ARE GAZING AT AND COME BACK TO RECLAIM HER BOW
5894-64100-0028 BETTER SATISFIED NOW HE IS RATHER WORRIED BY HIS IMPORTUNATE FRIEND AND TO GET RID OF HIM ADDS IF YOU ARE REALLY DESIROUS TO KNOW HOW MISS WYNN BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH HIM YOU CAN ASK THE LADY HERSELF NOT FOR ALL THE WORLD WOULD THE SWELL PUT THAT QUESTION TO GWEN WYNN
5894-64100-0029 IT WOULD NOT BE SAFE AND THUS SNUBBED HE SAUNTERS AWAY BEFORE SHE IS UP TO THE SPOT RYECROFT LEFT WITH MISS LINTON REMAINS IN CONVERSATION WITH HER IT IS NOT HIS FIRST INTERVIEW
5894-64100-0030 INTRODUCED BY THE YOUNG LADIES AS THE GENTLEMAN WHO WHEN THE PLEASURE BOAT WAS CAUGHT IN A DANGEROUS WHIRL OUT OF WHICH OLD JOSEPH WAS UNABLE TO EXTRICATE IT CAME TO THEIR RESCUE POSSIBLY TO THE SAVING OF THEIR LIVES THUS THE VERSION OF THE ADVENTURE
5894-64100-0031 VOUCHSAFED TO THE AUNT SUFFICIENT TO SANCTION HIS BEING RECEIVED AT THE COURT AND THE ANCIENT TOAST OF CHELTENHAM HAS BEEN CHARMED WITH HIM IN THE HANDSOME HUSSAR OFFICER SHE BEHOLDS THE TYPICAL HERO OF HER ROMANCE READING
5894-64100-0032 SO MUCH LIKE IT THAT LORD LUTESTRING HAS LONG AGO GONE OUT OF HER THOUGHTS PASSED FROM HER MEMORY AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN BUT A MUSICAL SOUND OF ALL WHO BEND BEFORE HER THIS DAY THE WORSHIP OF NONE IS SO WELCOME AS THAT OF THE MARTIAL STRANGER
5894-64100-0033 RESUMING HER BOW GWEN SHOOTS NO BETTER THAN BEFORE HER THOUGHTS INSTEAD OF BEING CONCENTRATED ON THE PAINTED CIRCLES AS HER EYES ARE HALF THE TIME STRAYING OVER HER SHOULDERS TO HIM BEHIND STILL IN A TETE A TETE WITH THE AUNT
5894-64100-0034 HER ARROWS FLY WILD AND WIDE SCARCE ONE STICKING IN THE STRAW IN FINE AMONG ALL THE COMPETITORS SHE COUNTS LOWEST SCORE THE POOREST SHE HAS HERSELF EVER MADE BUT WHAT MATTERS IT SHE IS ONLY TOO PLEASED WHEN HER QUIVER IS EMPTY
5894-64100-0035 AND SHE CAN HAVE EXCUSE TO RETURN TO MISS LINTON ON SOME QUESTION CONNECTED WITH THE HOSPITALITIES OF THE HOUSE OBSERVING ALL THIS AND MUCH MORE BESIDES GEORGE SHENSTONE FEELS AGGRIEVED INDEED EXASPERATED
5894-64100-0036 SO TERRIBLY IT TAKES ALL HIS BEST BREEDING TO WITHHOLD HIM FROM AN EXHIBITION OF BAD BEHAVIOUR HE MIGHT NOT SUCCEED WERE HE TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER ON THE GROUND WHICH HE DOES NOT AS IF MISDOUBTING HIS POWER OF RESTRAINT
5894-64100-0037 AND FEARING TO MAKE A FOOL OF HIMSELF HE TOO FRAMES EXCUSE AND LEAVES LLANGORREN LONG BEFORE THE SPORTS COME TO A CLOSE NOT RUDELY OR WITH ANY SHOW OF SPLEEN HE IS A GENTLEMAN EVEN IN HIS ANGER
5894-64100-0038 AND BIDDING A POLITE AND FORMAL ADIEU TO MISS LINTON WITH ONE EQUALLY CEREMONIOUS BUT MORE DISTANT TO MISS WYNN HE SLIPS ROUND TO THE STABLES ORDERS HIS HORSE LEAPS INTO THE SADDLE AND RIDES OFF
5894-64100-0039 MANY THE DAY HE HAS ENTERED THE GATES OF LLANGORREN WITH A LIGHT AND HAPPY HEART THIS DAY HE GOES OUT OF THEM WITH ONE HEAVY AND SAD IF MISSED FROM THE ARCHERY MEETING IT IS NOT BY MISS WYNN
5894-64100-0040 INSTEAD SHE IS GLAD OF HIS BEING GONE NOTWITHSTANDING THE LOVE PASSION FOR ANOTHER NOW OCCUPYING HER HEART ALMOST FILLING IT THERE IS STILL ROOM THERE FOR THE GENTLER SENTIMENT OF PITY SHE KNOWS HOW SHENSTONE SUFFERS HOW COULD SHE HELP KNOWING
5894-64100-0041 AND PITIES HIM NEVER MORE THAN AT THIS SAME MOMENT DESPITE THAT DISTANT HALF DISDAINFUL ADIEU VOUCHSAFED TO HER AT PARTING BY HIM INTENDED TO CONCEAL HIS THOUGHTS AS HIS SUFFERINGS WHILE BUT THE BETTER REVEALING THEM
5894-64100-0042 HOW MEN UNDERRATE THE PERCEPTION OF WOMEN IN MATTERS OF THIS KIND A VERY INTUITION NONE KEENER THAN THAT OF GWEN WYNN SHE KNOWS WHY HE HAS GONE SO SHORT AWAY WELL AS IF HE HAD TOLD HER
5894-64100-0043 AND WITH THE COMPASSIONATE THOUGHT STILL LINGERING SHE HEAVES A SIGH SAD AS SHE SEES HIM RIDE OUT THROUGH THE GATE GOING IN RECKLESS GALLOP BUT SUCCEEDED BY ONE OF RELIEF SOON AS HE IS OUT OF SIGHT
5894-64100-0044 IN AN INSTANT AFTER SHE IS GAY AND GLADSOME AS EVER ONCE MORE BENDING THE BOW AND MAKING THE CATGUT TWANG BUT NOW SHOOTING STRAIGHT HITTING THE TARGET EVERY TIME AND NOT UNFREQUENTLY LODGING A SHAFT IN THE GOLD
5894-64100-0045 NOT ONLY INSPIRES CONFIDENCE BUT EXCITES HER TO THE DISPLAY OF SKILL
