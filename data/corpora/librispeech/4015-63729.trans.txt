4015-63729-0000 PROMPT ACTION ON THE PART OF THE PHYSICIAN ON THE HOSPITAL AMBULANCE HAD STARTED HER FEEBLE HEART WHICH HAD BEEN AFFECTED BY THE CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY TO BEATING
4015-63729-0001 THIS AMONG OTHER THINGS COLONEL ASHLEY LEARNED WHEN HE HASTENED TO THE JEWELRY STORE FROM THE HOMESTEAD LEAVING AT THE LATTER PLACE HIS TRUSTY LIEUTENANT JACK YOUNG TO LOOK AFTER BOTH LARCH AND HARRY KING
4015-63729-0002 NEITHER OF WHOM SEEMED LIKELY TO LEAVE THE PLACE VERY SOON TELL ME MORE ABOUT IT SAID THE COLONEL WHEN HE WAS SITTING WITH MISTER KETTRIDGE IN THE DIMLY LIGHTED JEWELRY SHOP AFTER SALLIE HAD BEEN TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL WHAT SHOCKED HER
4015-63729-0003 THE SAME ELECTRIC WIRES ON THE SHOWCASE THAT SHOCKED MISS BRILL THE OTHER DAY THE ELECTRICIANS HAD BEEN TOLD TO REMOVE THEM BUT HAD NOT YET DONE SO BUT I THOUGHT THOSE WIRES WERE DEAD CUT AFTER THE OTHER ACCIDENT MISTER KETTRIDGE
4015-63729-0004 SO THEY WERE BUT THEY CAN BE SUPPLIED WITH CURRENT FROM ANOTHER SOURCE IT SEEMS AND I WAS THE INNOCENT CAUSE OF DOING IT YOU HOW BY THROWING OVER A SWITCH ON THE WORK BENCH WHERE JAMES DARCY USED TO BUSY HIMSELF
4015-63729-0005 AN ELECTRIC SWITCH ON DARCY'S WORK BENCH YES COME AND SEE FOR YOURSELF I'VE SENT FOR THE ELECTRICIAN TO COME AND RIP OUT EVERYTHING I'LL HAVE THE PLACE ALL WIRED OVER IT WAS A MAKESHIFT JOB TO BEGIN WITH
4015-63729-0006 AND SINCE DARCY COMPLICATED THE WIRES WITH SOME THAT HE HOPED TO RUN HIS ELECTRIC LATHE WITH THERE IS NO TELLING WHEN ONE MAY GET A SHOCK HOW DID IT HAPPEN ASKED THE COLONEL AS THE JEWELER LED THE WAY TO THAT PART OF THE STORE WHERE DARCY HAD THE REPAIR BENCH
4015-63729-0007 BEHIND THE WATCH SHOWCASE IT WAS NOW CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT AND THE EXCITEMENT OVER THE ACCIDENT TO SALLIE WHICH HAD OCCURRED AFTER THE CLOSING HOUR FOR THE STORE HAD SUBSIDED NOT AS MUCH OF A CROWD HAVING GATHERED AT THAT TIME OF THE EVENING
4015-63729-0008 AS WOULD HAVE DONE EARLIER WELL IT HAPPENED THIS WAY EXPLAINED KETTRIDGE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SPECIAL SALE OF A MEDIUM PRICED LINE OF GOODS TO MORROW I WAS GETTING READY FOR IT AFTER THE CLERKS HAD GONE SETTING OUT THE DISPLAY AND THE LIKE
4015-63729-0009 WHEN I FOUND I NEEDED HELP IT WASN'T MUCH JUST THE LITTLE ODDS AND ENDS THAT A WOMAN CAN DO BETTER THAN A MAN WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING THINGS LOOK FANCY I MIGHT HAVE TELEPHONED FOR MISS BRILL
4015-63729-0010 BUT I DIDN'T LIKE TO BRING HER BACK AS SHE'D WORKED HARD ALL DAY THEN I THOUGHT OF SALLIE PAGE IT'S TRUE SHE'S DEAF BUT SHE HAS BEEN IN THE FAMILY SO TO SPEAK A LONG WHILE AND SHE KNOWS THE SHOP AND THE GOODS PRETTY WELL
4015-63729-0011 SHE'S QUICK IF SHE IS OLD SO I GOT HER DOWN ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK AND WE STARTED IN THEN EXACTLY HOW IT HAPPENED I DON'T KNOW I WAS PUTTERING AROUND THE WORK TABLE WHERE DARCY USED TO DO HIS JEWEL SETTING AND HIS REPAIR WORK
4015-63729-0012 AND SALLIE WAS OVER NEAR THE SHOWCASE I WANTED MORE LIGHT ON A CERTAIN PIECE OF JEWELRY I HAD IN MY HAND AND I THOUGHTLESSLY THREW OVER A SWITCH I SAW ON DARCY'S TABLE IT WAS A SWITCH I HADN'T NOTICED BEFORE
4015-63729-0013 IN FACT I ACCIDENTALLY UNCOVERED IT BY MOVING A COLLECTION OF HIS TOOLS I HADN'T PREVIOUSLY DISTURBED NO SOONER HAD I CLOSED THE CIRCUIT THAN I HEARD A SCREAM FROM SALLIE AND SAW HER FALL BACKWARDS I HAD GIVEN HER A SHOCK WITHOUT KNOWING IT
4015-63729-0014 THAT WAS QUEER MURMURED THE COLONEL LET ME HAVE A LOOK AT THAT SWITCH AND WHILE YOU'RE ABOUT IT I'LL LOOK TOO SAID ANOTHER VOICE IN THE DIMLY LIGHTED STORE AND AS THE TWO TURNED IN STARTLED SURPRISE
4015-63729-0015 THEY SAW DETECTIVE CARROLL SMILING AT THEM I HEARD THERE WAS ANOTHER ACCIDENT UP HERE HE WENT ON STILL SMILING SO I CAME TO HAVE A LOOK
4015-63729-0016 THE ELECTRIC SWITCH ON DARCY'S TABLE WAS THE ANSWER I COULDN'T HELP HEARING WHAT YOU SAID MISTER KETTRIDGE SAID CARROLL AND I DON'T KNOW AS I WOULD HAVE TRIED NOT TO IF I COULD THIS IS IMPORTANT I RATHER GUESS IT MAKES IT LOOK A BIT BAD FOR YOUR FRIEND COLONEL ASHLEY
4015-63729-0017 AND THERE WAS A SNEER IN THE WORDS WELL I DON'T KNOW WAS THE COOL RESPONSE THE WIRES AS I UNDERSTAND IT ARE TO RUN AN ELECTRIC LATHE AND THEY MIGHT EASILY HAVE BECOME CROSSED
4015-63729-0018 BUT IT'S A GOOD ONE I'LL HAVE A LOOK AT THAT SWITCH I THOUGHT MAYBE I MIGHT FIND SOMETHING INTERESTING HERE WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THE SHOCK TO THE OLD SERVANT AND I DIDN'T MISS MY GUESS
4015-63729-0019 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR THE COLONEL OR MISTER KETTRIDGE TO SAY OR DO AND THEY REMAINED PASSIVE WHILE CARROLL TOOK HIS TIME LOOKING ABOUT THEN HE TELEPHONED FOR HALIDAY OF THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE AND ALSO FOR THE CHIEF ELECTRICIAN OF THE POLICE SIGNAL SYSTEM
4015-63729-0020 AND ALL THREE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING AT THE WIRES AND TESTING THEM WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT ASKED MISTER KETTRIDGE OF THE COLONEL WHEN THE STORE WAS AGAIN DIM AND QUIET WHAT DO I THINK I DON'T KNOW I'M GOING TO HAVE A TALK WITH DARCY IN THE MORNING
4015-63729-0021 WELL I'LL DROP HIS CASE THAT'S ALL IF DARCY SIMULATED SURPRISE WHEN THE NEXT MORNING AT THE JAIL
4015-63729-0022 THE PRISONER WAS A CONSUMMATE ACTOR THE DETECTIVE THOUGHT COLONEL ASHLEY DARCY EXCLAIMED I NEVER KNEW THAT MY LATHE WIRES CROSSED OR CONNECTED WITH ANY CIRCUIT THAT MIGHT SHOCK A PERSON IT IS TRUE I HAD THE WIRES RUN IN SECRETLY
4015-63729-0023 AS I DIDN'T WANT MY COUSIN TO KNOW ABOUT THEM SHE DIDN'T FAVOR MY EXPERIMENTS ON THE ELECTRICAL LATHE
4015-63729-0024 AND OF COURSE YOU CAN EASILY IMAGINE I NEVER COULD PLAN TO INJURE SALLIE PAGE THAT WAY OR THE YOUNG LADY WHO WAS KNOCKED DOWN THE OTHER DAY
4015-63729-0025 BUT I AM BOUND TO POINT OUT TO YOU THAT THE PROSECUTION WILL MAKE THE MOST OF THIS AND THAT IT LOOKS BAD FOR YOU I KNOW IT DOES COLONEL BUT I HAD NO MORE TO DO WITH MY COUSIN'S DEATH THAN CARROLL OR YOU
4015-63729-0026 NOR HAVE I THE LEAST SUSPICION WHO DID KILL HER MY GOD WHAT OBJECT WOULD I HAVE AND HE TURNED AND PACED UP AND DOWN WELL I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN SAID THE COLONEL BUT I MUST SAY IT LOOKS BLACK
4015-63729-0027 THEN YOU NEVER KNEW YOUR WIRES MIGHT BY THE CLOSING OF THE SWITCH ON YOUR TABLE SHOCK SOME ONE STANDING NEAR THE SHOW CASE I NEVER DREAMED OF IT THE WIRES MUST HAVE BEEN CHANGED SINCE I USED THEM THAT WILL BE LOOKED INTO
4015-63729-0028 AND THE STOPPING OF THE CLOCKS COULD YOUR APPARATUS HAVE DONE THAT NEVER IT IS TRUE A STRONG ELECTRICAL CURRENT MIGHT
4015-63729-0029 BUT IT WOULD NOT STOP ALL THE CLOCKS IN THE STORE OR ALL THAT WERE GOING AT DIFFERENT HOURS PERHAPS NOT WELL I MUST SEE WHAT I CAN DO
