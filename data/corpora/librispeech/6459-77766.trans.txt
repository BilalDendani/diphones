6459-77766-0000 THE GENIAL IDIOT
6459-77766-0001 HE DISCUSSES MAXIMS AND PROVERBS GOOD CRIED THE IDIOT FROM BEHIND THE VOLUMINOUS FOLDS OF THE MAGAZINE SECTION OF HIS SUNDAY NEWSPAPER HERE'S A MAN AFTER MY OWN HEART
6459-77766-0002 PROFESSOR DUFF OF GLASGOW UNIVERSITY
6459-77766-0003 THAT THE MAXIMS AND PROVERBS OF OUR FOREFATHERS ARE LARGELY HOCUS POCUS AND BUNCOMBE I'VE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THAT MYSELF FROM THE MOMENT I HAD MY FIRST COPY BOOK LESSON IN WHICH I HAD TO SCRAWL THE LINE
6459-77766-0004 IT'S A LONG LANE THAT HAS NO TURNING TWENTY FOUR TIMES
6459-77766-0005 I FORGET JUST HOW IT GOES WHAT TOMMY ROT THAT IS WELL I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT MISTER IDIOT SAID MISTER WHITECHOKER TAPPING HIS FINGERS TOGETHER REFLECTIVELY
6459-77766-0006 ARE INSTILLED INTO THE MINDS OF THE YOUNG BY THE OLD PROVERBS AND MAXIMS THAT REMAIN WITH THEM FOREVER
6459-77766-0007 THAN IN THE ORIGINAL MODEL THE LEG THAT'S NEVER PULLED DOESN'T GO SHORT IN A STRINGENT FINANCIAL MARKET AND A COURTSHIP WITHOUT A KISS EVEN IF IT LASTED ONLY FIVE MINUTES
6459-77766-0008 SAID MISTER WHITECHOKER PERHAPS AFTER ALL THE IDEA IS ILL EXPRESSED IN THE ORIGINAL PERFECTLY CORRECT SAID THE IDIOT BUT EVEN THEN WHAT
6459-77766-0009 SUPPOSE THEY HAD PUT THE THING RIGHT IN THE BEGINNING AND SAID IT'S A LONG LANE THAT HAS NO ENDING WHAT'S THE USE OF PUTTING A THING LIKE THAT IN A COPY BOOK
6459-77766-0010 WHY NOT TELL HIM IT'S A LONG WELL THAT HAS NO BOTTOM OR A LONG DOG THAT HAS NO WAGGING OR A LONG RAILROAD THAT HAS NO TERMINAL FACILITIES OH WELL INTERPOSED THE BIBLIOMANIAC
6459-77766-0011 THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHERS AND THE WAY THEY REFUTE ONE ANOTHER IS TO ME A CONSTANT SOURCE OF DELIGHT SAID THE IDIOT THERE'S PROCRASTINATION IS THE THIEF OF TIME FOR INSTANCE
6459-77766-0012 THAT'S A CLEAR INJUNCTION TO YOUTH TO GET UP AND HUSTLE AND HE STARTS IN WITH ALL THE IMPULSIVENESS OF YOUTH AND THE FIRST THING HE KNOWS BANG HE RUNS SLAP INTO LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP OR SECOND THOUGHTS ARE BEST
6459-77766-0013 WHAT SUPERIOR CLAIMS THE SECOND THOUGHT HAS OVER THE FIRST OR THE SEVENTY SEVENTH THOUGHT THAT IT SHOULD BECOME AXIOMATIC I VOW I CAN'T SEE IF IT'S MORALITY YOU'RE AFTER I AM DEAD AGAINST THE TEACHINGS OF THAT PROVERB
6459-77766-0014 THE SECOND THOUGHT IS THE OPEN DOOR TO DUPLICITY WHEN IT COMES TO A QUESTION OF MORALS
6459-77766-0015 WHY HIS SHIRT IS WET HIS FIRST THOUGHT IS NATURALLY
6459-77766-0016 WHY BECAUSE IT FELL INTO THE POND BUT SECOND THOUGHT COMES ALONG WITH VISIONS OF HARD SPANKING AND A SUPPERLESS BED IN STORE FOR HIM AND SUGGESTS THE IDEA THAT THERE WAS A LEAK IN THE SUNDAY SCHOOL ROOF RIGHT OVER THE PLACE WHERE I WAS SITTING OR
6459-77766-0017 I SAT DOWN ON THE TEACHER'S GLASS OF WATER THAT'S THE SORT OF THING SECOND THOUGHT DOES IN THE MATTER OF MORALS I ADMIT OF COURSE THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN SECOND THOUGHTS ARE BETTER THAN FIRST ONES FOR INSTANCE IF YOUR FIRST THOUGHT IS TO NAME THE BABY JIMMIE AND JIMMIE TURNS OUT TO BE A GIRL
6459-77766-0018 BUT IT IS NOT ALWAYS SO AND I OBJECT TO THE NERVE OF THE BROAD GENERAL STATEMENT THAT IT IS SO SOMETIMES FIFTH THOUGHTS ARE BEST IN SCIENCE I GUESS YOU'LL FIND THAT THE MAN WHO THINKS THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVENTH THOUGHT
6459-77766-0019 ALONG CERTAIN LINES HAS GOT THE LAST AND BEST END OF IT AND SO IT GOES
6459-77766-0020 BUT YOUR SELF SUFFICIENT OLD PROVERB MAKER FALLS BACK BEHIND THE IMPENETRABLE WALL OF HIS OWN CONCEIT
6459-77766-0021 AND WE LIKE A FLOCK OF SHEEP FOLLOW THIS LEADER AND GO BLATTING THAT SENTIMENT DOWN THROUGH THE AGES
6459-77766-0022 BY THE SUM TOTAL OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE WELL YOU NEEDN'T GET MAD ABOUT IT SAID THE LAWYER I NEVER SAID IT SO YOU CAN'T BLAME ME STILL THERE ARE SOME PROVERBS SAID MISTER WHITECHOKER BLANDLY
6459-77766-0023 THAT WE MAY NOT SO SUMMARILY DISMISS TAKE FOR INSTANCE YOU NEVER MISS THE WATER TILL THE WELL RUNS DRY ONE OF THE WORST OF THE LOT MISTER WHITECHOKER SAID THE IDIOT I'VE MISSED THE WATER LOTS OF TIMES WHEN THE WELL WAS FULL AS EVER
6459-77766-0024 YOU MISS THE WATER WHEN THE PIPES FREEZE UP DON'T YOU YOU OR RATHER I I SOMETIMES MISS THE WATER LIKE TIME AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AFTER A PLEASANT EVENING WITH SOME JOVIAL FRIENDS WHEN THERE'S NO END OF IT IN THE WELL
6459-77766-0025 BUT NOT A DROP WITHIN REACH OF MY FEVERED HAND AND I HAVEN'T THE ENERGY TO GROPE MY WAY DOWN STAIRS TO THE ICE PITCHER THERE'S MORE WATER IN THAT PROVERB THAN TANGIBLE ASSETS FROM THE STANDPOINT OF VERACITY THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMMORAL PROVERBS OF THE LOT
6459-77766-0026 AS A RULE THESE DAYS YOU NEVER FIND THE WATER TILL THE WELL HAS BEEN PUMPED DRY AND PUT IN THE HANDS OF A RECEIVER FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE BOND HOLDERS FACT IS ALL THESE WATER PROVERBS ARE TO BE REGARDED WITH SUSPICION
6459-77766-0027 WELL SAID THE IDIOT THERE'S ONE AND IT'S THE NERVIEST OF EM ALL
6459-77766-0028 HILL ASK ANY MAN IN WALL STREET HOW HIGH THE WATER HAS RUN UP IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND SEE WHAT HE TELLS YOU AND THEN YOU MAY DRIVE A HORSE TO WATER BUT YOU CANNOT MAKE HIM DRINK IS ANOTHER CHOICE SPECIMEN OF THE WATERBURY SCHOOL OF PHILOSOPHY
6459-77766-0029 AND SUCH DRINKERS AS THEY HAVE BECOME IT'S REALLY AWFUL IF I KNEW THE NAME OF THAT PARTICULAR MAXIMILIAN WHO INVENTED THOSE WATER PROVERBS I'D DO MY BEST TO HAVE HIM INDICTED FOR DOING BUSINESS WITHOUT A LICENSE
6459-77766-0030 IT IS TOO BAD SAID THE IDIOT AND I AM JUST AS SORRY ABOUT IT AS YOU ARE BUT AFTER ALL THE WISDOM OF THE ANCIENTS WISE AND WISDOMATIC AS IT WAS SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO PUT AT NOUGHT ALL MODERN THOUGHT
6459-77766-0031 WHY NOT ADAPT THE WISDOM OF THE ANCIENTS TO MODERN CONDITIONS
6459-77766-0032 AND I KNOW OF NO BETTER OUTLET FOR REFORM THAN IN THESE SELF SAME SPENCERIAN PROVERBS
6459-77766-0033 NOW IN THE WRITING LESSONS WHY NOT ADAPT YOUR MEANS TO YOUR ENDS WHY MAKE A BEGINNER IN PENMANSHIP WRITE OVER AND OVER AGAIN A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN THE BUSH WHICH IT ISN'T BY THE WAY
6459-77766-0034 TO A MAN WHO IS A GOOD SHOT WHEN YOU CAN BEAR IN ON HIS MIND THAT A DOT ON THE I IS WORTH TWO ON THE T OR FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF YOUR SCHOOL TEACHERS WHY DON'T YOU GET UP A PROVERB LIKE IT'S A LONG LESSON THAT HAS NO LEARNING
6459-77766-0035 OR IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN HAVING YOUR BOY BROUGHT UP TO THE STRENUOUS LIFE WHY DON'T YOU HAVE HIM MAKE SIXTY COPIES OF THE APHORISM A PUNCH IN THE SOLAR IS WORTH SIX ON THE NOSE
6459-77766-0036 YOU TELL YOUR CHILDREN NEVER TO WHISTLE UNTIL THEY ARE OUT OF THE WOODS NOW WHERE IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT'S LOVELY SHOULD A BOY WHISTLE IF NOT IN THE WOODS
6459-77766-0037 THAT'S WHERE THE WIND WHISTLES IF NATURE WHISTLES ANYWHERE
6459-77766-0038 WOODS WERE MADE FOR WHISTLING AND ANY MAN WHO EVER SAT OVER A BIG LOG FIRE IN CAMP OR IN LIBRARY WHO HAS NOT NOTICED THAT THE LOGS THEMSELVES WHISTLE CONSTANTLY WELL HE IS A PACHYDERM
6459-77766-0039 WELL AS FAR AS I CAN REACH A CONCLUSION FROM ALL THAT YOU HAVE SAID
6459-77766-0040 AND THAT YOU THINK THEY SHOULD BE REVISED EXACTLY SAID THE IDIOT IT'S A SPLENDID IDEA SAID MISTER BRIEF BUT AFTER ALL YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO BEGIN ON
6459-77766-0041 CERTAINLY SAID THE IDIOT HERE IS A LIST OF THEM AND AS HE ROSE UP TO DEPART HE HANDED MISTER BRIEF A PAPER ON WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN AS FOLLOWS YOU NEVER FIND THE WATER TILL THE STOCK FALLS OFF TWENTY POINTS
6459-77766-0042 A STITCH IN TIME SAVES NOTHING AT ALL AT PRESENT TAILORS RATES YOU LOOK AFTER THE PENNIES SOMEBODY ELSE WILL DEPOSIT THE POUNDS IT'S A LONG HEIRESS THAT KNOWS NO YEARNING
6459-77766-0043 SECOND THOUGHTS ARE ALWAYS SECOND PROCRASTINATION IS THE THEME OF GOSSIPS NEVER PUT OFF TO DAY WHAT YOU CAN PUT ON DAY AFTER TO MORROW
6459-77766-0044 SUFFICIENT UNTO THE DAY ARE THE OBLIGATIONS OF LAST MONTH ONE GOOD SWAT DESERVES ANOTHER BY JOVE SAID MISTER BRIEF AS HE READ THEM OFF
6459-77766-0045 YOU CAN'T GO BACK ON ANY OF EM CAN YOU NO SAID THE BIBLIOMANIAC
