5649-40561-0000 TO THE SLIGHT OF THE DETRACTOR OR ASPERSION OF THE DEFAMER AND WE ASK THY FORGIVENESS SHOULD OUR FRAILTIES BETRAY US INTO AMBIGUITIES AS WE ASK THY FORGIVENESS SHOULD OUR STEPS ADVANCE TO THE VERGE OF IMPROPRIETIES
5649-40561-0001 AND SAGACITY WHEREBY WE MAY ATTAIN DISCRIMINATION THAT THOU WILT AID US BY THY GUIDANCE UNTO RIGHT CONCEPTIONS AND ENABLE US WITH THY HELP TO EXPRESS THEM WITH CLEARNESS AND THOU WILT GUARD US FROM ERROR IN NARRATION
5649-40561-0002 AND KEEP US FROM FOLLY EVEN IN PLEASANTRY SO THAT WE MAY BE SAFE FROM THE CENSURE OF SARCASTIC TONGUES AND SECURE FROM THE FATAL EFFECTS OF FALSE ORNAMENT AND MAY NOT RESORT TO ANY IMPROPER SOURCE
5649-40561-0003 AND OCCUPY NO POSITION THAT WOULD ENTAIL REGRET NOR BE ASSAILED BY ANY ILL CONSEQUENCES OR BLAME NOR BE CONSTRAINED TO APOLOGY FOR INCONSIDERATION O GOD FULFILL FOR US THIS OUR DESIRE
5649-40561-0004 AND PUT US IN POSSESSION OF THIS OUR EARNEST WISH AND EXCLUDE US NOT FROM THY AMPLE SHADE NOR LEAVE US TO BECOME THE PREY OF THE DEVOURER FOR WE STRETCH TO THEE THE HAND OF ENTREATY AND PROFESS ENTIRE SUBMISSION TO THEE
5649-40561-0005 SO THE CHARMS OF CONVERSATION FASCINATED US WHILE WAKEFULNESS STILL PREVAILED AMONG US UNTIL THE MOON HAD AT LENGTH DISAPPEARED IN THE WEST BUT WHEN THE GLOOM OF NIGHT HAD THUS DRAWN ITS CURTAIN AND NOTHING BUT SLUMBER REMAINED ABROAD
5649-40561-0006 WE HEARD FROM THE DOOR THE LOW CALL OF A BENIGHTED TRAVELER AND THEN FOLLOWED THE KNOCK OF ONE SEEKING ADMISSION AND WE ANSWERED
5649-40561-0007 AND THE STRANGER REPLIED LISTEN YE WHO HERE ARE DWELLING MAY YOU SO BE KEPT FROM ILL SO MAY MISCHIEF NE'ER BEFALL YOU LONG AS LIFE YOUR BREAST SHALL FILL GLOOM OF DISMAL NIGHT AND DREARY DRIVES A WRETCH TO SEEK YOUR DOOR
5649-40561-0008 WHOSE DISHEVELED HOARY TRESSES ALL WITH DUST ARE SPRINKLED O'ER WHO THOUGH DESTITUTE AND LONELY FAR HAS ROAMED ON HILL AND DALE
5649-40561-0009 WE HASTED TO OPEN THE DOOR AND RECEIVED HIM WITH WELCOME SAYING TO THE SERVANT
5649-40561-0010 BRING WHATEVER IS READY BUT THE STRANGER SAID BY HIM WHO BROUGHT ME TO YOUR ABODE I WILL NOT TASTE OF YOUR HOSPITALITY UNLESS YOU PLEDGE TO ME THAT YOU WILL NOT PERMIT ME TO BE AN INCUMBRANCE TO YOU
5649-40561-0011 NOR IMPOSE ON YOURSELVES NECESSITY OF EATING ON MY ACCOUNT NOW IT WAS JUST AS IF HE HAD BEEN INFORMED OF OUR WISHES OR HAD SHOT FROM THE SAME BOW AS OUR SENTIMENTS SO WE GRATIFIED HIM BY ACCEDING TO THE CONDITION
5649-40561-0012 AND HIGHLY COMMENDED HIM FOR HIS ACCOMMODATING DISPOSITION BUT WHEN THE SERVANT HAD PRODUCED WHAT WAS READY AND THE CANDLE WAS LIGHTED UP IN THE MIDST OF US I REGARDED HIM ATTENTIVELY AND LO IT WAS ABU ZEID
5649-40561-0013 WHEREUPON I ADDRESSED MY COMPANIONS IN THESE WORDS MAY YOU HAVE JOY OF THE GUEST WHO HAS REPAIRED TO YOU FOR THOUGH THE MOON OF THE HEAVENS HAS SET THE FULL MOON OF POETRY HAS ARISEN AND THOUGH THE MOON OF THE ECLIPSE HAS DISAPPEARED
5649-40561-0014 THE FULL MOON OF ELOQUENCE HAS SHONE FORTH SO THE WINE OF JOY INFUSED ITSELF INTO THEM
5649-40561-0015 AND THEY REJECTED THE SLUMBER WHICH THEY HAD CONTEMPLATED AND BEGAN TO RESUME THE PLEASANTRY WHICH THEY HAD LAID ASIDE WHILE ABU ZEID REMAINED INTENT ON THE BUSINESS IN HAND
5649-40561-0016 I SAID TO HIM ENTERTAIN US WITH ONE OF THY STRANGE ANECDOTES OR WITH AN ACCOUNT OF ONE OF THY WONDERFUL JOURNEYS AND HE SAID THE RESULT OF LONG JOURNEYS BROUGHT ME TO THIS LAND MYSELF BEING IN A STATE OF HUNGER AND DISTRESS
5649-40561-0017 AND BY FATE SO JUSTLY CALLED THE PARENT OF ADVENTURES I STOOD AT THE DOOR OF A HOUSE AND IMPROVISED THESE WORDS INMATES OF THIS ABODE ALL HAIL ALL HAIL
5649-40561-0018 LONG MAY YOU LIVE IN PLENTY'S VERDANT VALE OH GRANT YOUR AID TO ONE BY TOIL OPPREST WAY WORN BENIGHTED DESTITUTE DISTREST WHOSE TORTURED ENTRAILS ONLY HUNGER HOLD
5649-40561-0019 FOR SINCE HE TASTED FOOD TWO DAYS ARE TOLD A WRETCH WHO FINDS NOT WHERE TO LAY HIS HEAD THOUGH BROODING NIGHT HER WEARY WING HATH SPREAD BUT ROAMS IN ANXIOUS HOPE A FRIEND TO MEET
5649-40561-0020 WHOSE BOUNTY LIKE A SPRING OF WATER SWEET MAY HEAL HIS WOES A FRIEND WHO STRAIGHT WILL SAY COME IN TIS TIME THY STAFF ASIDE TO LAY BUT THERE CAME OUT TO ME A BOY IN A SHORT TUNIC WHO SAID
5649-40561-0021 BY HIM WHO HOSPITABLE RITES ORDAINED AND FIRST OF ALL AND BEST THOSE RITES MAINTAINED I SWEAR THAT FRIENDLY CONVERSE AND A HOME IS ALL WE HAVE FOR THOSE WHO NIGHTLY ROAM AND I REPLIED
5649-40561-0022 WHAT CAN I DO WITH AN EMPTY HOUSE AND A HOST WHO IS HIMSELF THUS UTTERLY DESTITUTE BUT WHAT IS THY NAME BOY FOR THY INTELLIGENCE CHARMS ME HE REPLIED
5649-40561-0023 AND I WAS REARED AT FAID AND MY MOTHER BARRAH WHO IS SUCH AS HER NAME IMPLIES TOLD ME SHE MARRIED ONE OF THE NOBLES OF SERONG AND GHASSAN WHO DESERTED HER STEALTHILY AND THERE WAS AN END OF HIM
5649-40561-0024 NOW I KNEW BY THESE DISTINCT SIGNS THAT HE WAS MY CHILD
5649-40561-0025 WHEREUPON HE RETURNED THANKS FOR THIS OUR BOUNTY AND WAS SO PROFUSELY LAVISH IN HIS ACKNOWLEDGMENTS THAT WE THOUGHT HIS EXPRESSION OF GRATITUDE EXCESSIVE
5649-40561-0026 THOUGH I NE'ER HAD EXPECTED MY FRAUD UNDETECTED OR DOUBTFUL MY MEANING TO MAKE
5649-40561-0027 AND BY THESE ARE MY GAINS EVER MADE SUCH SCHEMES I DEVISE THAT THE CUNNING AND WISE NEVER PRACTICED THE LIKE OR CONCEIVED NOR ASMAI NOR KOMAIT ANY WONDERS RELATE LIKE THOSE THAT MY WILES HAVE ACHIEVED
