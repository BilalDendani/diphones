3046-137739-0012 THAT IT WAS SILLY TO SHOW OFF AND NOW THE REAL STORY PART OF MY STORY BEGINS HE MARRIED EVER SO MANY WIFES HE MARRIED NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE WIVES
3046-137739-0013 AND THEY ALL LIVED IN A GREAT GOLDEN PALACE IN THE MIDDLE OF A LOVELY GARDEN WITH FOUNTAINS HE DIDN'T REALLY WANT NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE WIVES BUT IN THOSE DAYS EVERYBODY MARRIED EVER SO MANY WIVES
3046-137739-0014 AND OF COURSE THE KING HAD TO MARRY EVER SO MANY MORE JUST TO SHOW
3046-137739-0015 BUT SOME WERE SIMPLY HORRID AND THE HORRID ONES QUARRELLED WITH THE NICE ONES AND MADE THEM HORRID TOO AND THEN THEY WOULD ALL QUARREL WITH SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD AND THAT WAS HORRID FOR HIM
3046-137739-0016 SHE LOVED HIM TOO MUCH SHE SAT IN HER ROOMS IN THE GOLDEN PALACE OR WALKED IN THE PALACE GARDEN AND WAS TRULY SORRY FOR HIM OF COURSE IF HE HAD CHOSEN TO TURN HIS RING ON HIS FINGER AND CALL UP THE DJINNS AND THE AFRITS
3046-137739-0017 WHEN THEY QUARRELLED TOO MUCH HE ONLY WALKED BY HIMSELF IN ONE PART OF THE BEAUTIFUL PALACE GARDENS AND WISHED HE HAD NEVER BEEN BORN
3046-137739-0018 SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD WENT OUT FOR PEACE AND QUIET AS USUAL AND AMONG THE ORANGE TREES HE MET BALKIS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VERY SORROWFUL BECAUSE SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD WAS SO WORRIED AND SHE SAID TO HIM O MY LORD AND LIGHT OF MY EYES
3046-137739-0019 TURN THE RING UPON YOUR FINGER AND SHOW THESE QUEENS OF EGYPT AND MESOPOTAMIA AND PERSIA AND CHINA THAT YOU ARE THE GREAT AND TERRIBLE KING BUT SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID O MY LADY AND DELIGHT OF MY LIFE REMEMBER THE ANIMAL THAT CAME OUT OF THE SEA
3046-137739-0020 AND MADE ME ASHAMED BEFORE ALL THE ANIMALS IN ALL THE WORLD BECAUSE I SHOWED OFF NOW IF I SHOWED OFF BEFORE THESE QUEENS OF PERSIA AND EGYPT AND ABYSSINIA AND CHINA MERELY BECAUSE THEY WORRY ME I MIGHT BE MADE EVEN MORE ASHAMED THAN I HAVE BEEN

3046-137739-0045 THE DJINNS JERKED THE PALACE AND THE GARDENS A THOUSAND MILES INTO THE AIR
3046-137739-0046 OH I'LL BE GOOD I'M SO SORRY I SPOKE ONLY BRING THE GARDENS BACK MY DEAR DARLING HUSBAND AND I'LL NEVER CONTRADICT AGAIN THE BUTTERFLY WAS NEARLY AS FRIGHTENED AS HIS WIFE AND SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD LAUGHED SO MUCH

3046-137739-0050 THE SUN SHONE ON THE DARK GREEN ORANGE LEAVES THE FOUNTAINS PLAYED AMONG THE PINK EGYPTIAN LILIES THE BIRDS WENT ON SINGING AND THE BUTTERFLY'S WIFE LAY ON HER SIDE UNDER THE CAMPHOR TREE WAGGLING HER WINGS AND PANTING
3046-137739-0051 HE LEANED BACK ALL WEAK AND HICCOUGHY AND SHOOK HIS FINGER AT THE BUTTERFLY AND SAID O GREAT WIZARD WHAT IS THE SENSE OF RETURNING TO ME MY PALACE IF AT THE SAME TIME YOU SLAY ME WITH MIRTH
3046-137739-0052 THEN CAME A TERRIBLE NOISE FOR ALL THE NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE QUEENS RAN OUT OF THE PALACE SHRIEKING AND SHOUTING AND CALLING FOR THEIR BABIES THEY HURRIED DOWN THE GREAT MARBLE STEPS BELOW THE FOUNTAIN
3046-137739-0053 FORWARD TO MEET THEM AND SAID WHAT IS YOUR TROUBLE O QUEENS THEY STOOD ON THE MARBLE STEPS ONE HUNDRED ABREAST AND SHOUTED WHAT IS OUR TROUBLE WE WERE LIVING PEACEFULLY IN OUR GOLDEN PALACE AS IS OUR CUSTOM
3046-137739-0054 WHEN UPON A SUDDEN THE PALACE DISAPPEARED AND WE WERE LEFT SITTING IN A THICK AND NOISOME DARKNESS AND IT THUNDERED AND DJINNS AND AFRITS MOVED ABOUT IN THE DARKNESS THAT IS OUR TROUBLE O HEAD QUEEN
3046-137739-0055 AND WE ARE MOST EXTREMELY TROUBLED ON ACCOUNT OF THAT TROUBLE FOR IT WAS A TROUBLESOME TROUBLE UNLIKE ANY TROUBLE WE HAVE KNOWN
3046-137739-0056 SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD'S VERY BEST BELOVED
3046-137739-0057 AND THE RIVERS OF THE GOLD OF THE SOUTH FROM THE DESERT OF ZINN TO THE TOWERS OF ZIMBABWE
3046-137739-0058 IT IS NOTHING O QUEENS A BUTTERFLY HAS MADE COMPLAINT AGAINST HIS WIFE BECAUSE SHE QUARRELLED WITH HIM AND IT HAS PLEASED OUR LORD SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD TO TEACH HER A LESSON IN LOW SPEAKING AND HUMBLENESS
3046-137739-0059 FOR THAT IS COUNTED A VIRTUE AMONG THE WIVES OF THE BUTTERFLIES THEN UP AND SPOKE AN EGYPTIAN QUEEN THE DAUGHTER OF A PHAROAH AND SHE SAID OUR PALACE CANNOT BE PLUCKED UP BY THE ROOTS LIKE A LEEK FOR THE SAKE OF A LITTLE INSECT NO
3046-137739-0060 SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD MUST BE DEAD AND WHAT WE HEARD AND SAW WAS THE EARTH THUNDERING AND DARKENING AT THE NEWS THEN BALKIS BECKONED THAT BOLD QUEEN WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER AND SAID TO HER AND TO THE OTHERS COME AND SEE
3046-137739-0061 THEY CAME DOWN THE MARBLE STEPS ONE HUNDRED ABREAST AND BENEATH HIS CAMPHOR TREE STILL WEAK WITH LAUGHING THEY SAW THE MOST WISE KING SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD
3046-137739-0062 AND THEY HEARD HIM SAY O WIFE OF MY BROTHER IN THE AIR REMEMBER AFTER THIS TO PLEASE YOUR HUSBAND IN ALL THINGS LEST HE BE PROVOKED TO STAMP HIS FOOT YET AGAIN FOR HE HAS SAID THAT HE IS USED TO THIS MAGIC
3046-137739-0063 AND HE IS MOST EMINENTLY A GREAT MAGICIAN ONE WHO STEALS AWAY THE VERY PALACE OF SULEIRNAN BIN DAOUD HIMSELF GO IN PEACE LITTLE FOLK AND HE KISSED THEM ON THE WINGS AND THEY FLEW AWAY
3046-137739-0064 WHO STOOD APART SMILING FELL FLAT ON THEIR FACES FOR THEY SAID IF THESE THINGS ARE DONE WHEN A BUTTERFLY IS DISPLEASED WITH HIS WIFE WHAT SHALL BE DONE TO US WHO HAVE VEXED OUR KING WITH OUR LOUD SPEAKING AND OPEN QUARRELLING THROUGH MANY DAYS
3046-137739-0065 THEN THEY PUT THEIR VEILS OVER THEIR HEADS AND THEY PUT THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR MOUTHS AND THEY TIPTOED BACK TO THE PALACE MOST MOUSY QUIET
3046-137739-0066 FOR WE HAVE TAUGHT THE QUEENS OF EGYPT AND ETHIOPIA AND ABYSSINIA AND PERSIA AND INDIA AND CHINA WITH A GREAT AND A MEMORABLE TEACHING AND SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD STILL LOOKING AFTER THE BUTTERFLIES WHERE THEY PLAYED IN THE SUNLIGHT SAID
3046-137739-0067 O MY LADY AND JEWEL OF MY FELICITY WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN FOR I HAVE BEEN JESTING WITH A BUTTERFLY EVER SINCE I CAME INTO THE GARDEN
3046-137739-0068 O MY LORD AND REGENT OF MY EXISTENCE I HID BEHIND THE CAMPHOR TREE AND SAW IT ALL IT WAS I WHO TOLD THE BUTTERFLY'S WIFE TO ASK THE BUTTERFLY TO STAMP
3046-137739-0069 BECAUSE I HOPED THAT FOR THE SAKE OF THE JEST MY LORD WOULD MAKE SOME GREAT MAGIC AND THAT THE QUEENS WOULD SEE IT AND BE FRIGHTENED AND SHE TOLD HIM WHAT THE QUEENS HAD SAID AND SEEN AND THOUGHT THEN SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD
3046-137739-0070 ROSE UP FROM HIS SEAT UNDER THE CAMPHOR TREE AND STRETCHED HIS ARMS AND REJOICED AND SAID O MY LADY AND SWEETENER OF MY DAYS KNOW THAT IF I HAD MADE A MAGIC AGAINST MY QUEENS FOR THE SAKE OF PRIDE OR ANGER
3046-137739-0071 AS I MADE THAT FEAST FOR ALL THE ANIMALS I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN PUT TO SHAME BUT BY MEANS OF YOUR WISDOM I MADE THE MAGIC FOR THE SAKE OF A JEST AND FOR THE SAKE OF A LITTLE BUTTERFLY AND BEHOLD
3046-137739-0072 IT HAS ALSO DELIVERED ME FROM THE VEXATIONS OF MY VEXATIOUS WIVES TELL ME THEREFORE O MY LADY AND HEART OF MY HEART HOW DID YOU COME TO BE SO WISE
3046-137739-0073 LOOKED UP INTO SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD'S EYES AND PUT HER HEAD A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE JUST LIKE THE BUTTERFLY AND SAID FIRST O MY LORD BECAUSE I LOVED YOU AND SECONDLY O MY LORD BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT WOMEN FOLK ARE
3046-137739-0074 THEN THEY WENT UP TO THE PALACE AND LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTERWARDS
3046-137739-0075 FROM HERE TO THE WIDE WORLD'S END
3046-137739-0076 AS YOU WOULD TALK TO A FRIEND THERE WAS NEVER A KING LIKE SOLOMON NOT SINCE THE WORLD BEGAN BUT SOLOMON TALKED TO A BUTTERFLY AS A MAN WOULD TALK TO A MAN
