1851-151817-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN ASTOUNDING YET TRUE THE PROFESSOR GAVE A GREAT START AT THIS ALMOST RELUCTANT SUGGESTION SHRINKING BACK WITH A LOOK WHICH FELL NOT FAR SHORT OF BEING HORRIFIED
1851-151817-0001 BUT THEN HE RALLIED FORCING A LAUGH BEFORE SPEAKING NO NO BRUNO
1851-151817-0002 AND TOO EVERYTHING WAS SO DISTINCT AND CLEARLY OUTLINED THAT ONE COULD FAIRLY FEEL THOSE BLESSED BOW ARROWS TICKLING A FELLOW IN THE SHORT RIBS
1851-151817-0003 NOT BUT THAT I SAY UNCLE PHAETON WHAT IS IT NOW WALDO
1851-151817-0004 GOT BOYS AND AND GIRLS AMONG EM I WONDER I DARESAY YES WHY NOT ANSWERED FEATHERWIT SCARCELY REALISING WHAT WORDS WERE BEING SHAPED BY HIS LIPS WHILE BRUNO BROKE INTO A BRIEF LIVED LAUGH
1851-151817-0005 MORE AT THAT HALF SHEEPISH EXPRESSION THAN AT THE QUERY ITSELF BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS GALORE I EXPECT KID BUT YOU NEEDN'T BORROW TROUBLE ON EITHER SCORE YOU CAN OUTRUN THE LADS WHILE AS FOR THE FAIRER SEX
1851-151817-0006 WELL THEY'LL TAKE PRECIOUS GOOD CARE TO KEEP WELL BEYOND YOUR REACH ESPECIALLY IF YOU WEAR SUCH ANOTHER FASCINATING GRIN AS
1851-151817-0007 THUNDER BRUNO GILLESPIE THROUGH ALL THIS INTERCHANGE THE AIR SHIP WAS MAINTAINING A WIDE SWEEP DRAWING NEARER THE FOREST BENEATH IF ONLY TO KEEP HIDDEN FROM THE EYES OF THE STRANGE PEOPLE IN YONDER DEEP VALLEY
1851-151817-0008 YET THE GAZE OF PHAETON FEATHERWIT AS A RULE KEPT TURNED TOWARDS THAT PARTICULAR POINT HIS EYES ON FIRE HIS LIPS TWITCHING HIS WHOLE DEMEANOUR THAT OF ONE WHO FEELS A DISCOVERY OF TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE LIES JUST BEFORE HIM
1851-151817-0009 ARE WE GOING TO LAND UNCLE PHAETON QUERIED BRUNO TAKING NOTE OF THAT PREOCCUPATION WHICH MIGHT EASILY PROVE DANGEROUS UNDER EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT QUESTION SERVED TO RECALL THE PROFESSOR TO MORE MATERIAL POINTS
1851-151817-0010 NOT FOR US ESPECIALLY UNCLE BUT FOR THE AEROSTAT EVEN IF THESE BE NOT THE PEOPLE YOU IMAGINE THEY ARE PAST ALL DOUBT A REMNANT OF THE ANCIENT AZTECS YONDER LIES THE TRUE LOST CITY AND WE ARE
1851-151817-0011 OH TRY TO COMPREHEND ALL THAT STATEMENT MEANS MY LADS PICTURE TO YOURSELVES WHAT BOUNDLESS FAME AND UNLIMITED CREDIT AWAITS OUR REPORT TO THE OUTER WORLD THE BENIGHTED WORLD THE BESOTTED WORLD THE THE
1851-151817-0012 WHILE WE'LL FORM
1851-151817-0013 FAIRLY SPLUTTERED WALDO AS THE AGAIN NEGLECTED AIR SHIP SPED SWIFTLY TOWARDS A MORE ELEVATED PORTION OF THAT EARTH PART OF THE TALL HILL CREST WHICH ACTED AS NATURE'S BARRICADE TO YONDER BY NATURE DEPRESSED VALLEY
1851-151817-0014 TIME ENOUGH LAD TIME ENOUGH SINCE WE ARE GOING TO LAND COOLLY ASSURED THE PROFESSOR DEFTLY MANIPULATING THE STEERING GEAR AND STILL CURYING AROUND THOSE TREE CROWNED HILLS
1851-151817-0015 IF WE ARE REALLY HUNTED AFTER TWILL NATURALLY BE IN THE QUARTER OF OUR VANISHMENT WHILE BY ALIGHTING AROUND YONDER NEARLY AT RIGHT ANGLES WITH OUR INITIAL APPROACH WE WILL HAVE NAUGHT TO FEAR FROM THE THE AZTECAN CLANS
1851-151817-0016 CLEARLY THE PROFESSOR HAD SETTLED IN HIS OWN MIND JUST WHAT LAY BEFORE THEM AND NOTHING SHORT OF THE LOST CITY OF THE AZTECS WOULD COME ANYWHERE NEAR SATISFYING THAT EXALTED IDEAL AND TAKING ALL POINTS INTO FULL CONSIDERATION
1851-151817-0017 WAS THERE ANYTHING SO VERY ABSURD IN HIS METHOD OF REASONING OR OF DRAWING A DEDUCTION STILL THAT EXALTATION DID NOT PREVENT UNCLE PHAETON FROM TAKING ALL ESSENTIAL PRECAUTIONS AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN AN ESPECIALLY SECURE LANDING PLACE WAS SIGHTED
1851-151817-0018 THAT HE REALLY ATTEMPTED TO TOUCH THE EARTH FULLY ONE HALF OF THAT WIDE CIRCUIT HAD BEEN MADE AND AS NOTHING COULD BE DETECTED TO GIVE BIRTH TO FEARS FOR EITHER SELF OR AIR SHIP THE AERONAUTS SKILFULLY LANDED THEIR VESSEL WITH ONLY THE SLIGHTEST OF JARS
1851-151817-0019 IT WAS A WELL SCREENED LOCATION WHERE NAUGHT COULD BE SEEN OF THE FLYING MACHINE UNTIL CLOSE AT HAND YET SO ARRANGED AS TO MAKE A HASTY FLIGHT A VERY EASY MATTER SHOULD THE OCCASION EVER ARISE
1851-151817-0020 NOT UNTIL THE LANDING WAS EFFECTED AND ALL MADE SECURE DID PROFESSOR FEATHERWIT SPEAK AGAIN THEN IT WAS WITH GRAVELY EARNEST SPEECH WHICH SUITABLY AFFECTED HIS NEPHEWS ABOVE ALL THINGS MY DEAR LADS BEAR EVER IN MIND THIS ONE FACT
1851-151817-0021 WE ARE NOT HERE TO FIGHT WE DO NOT COME AS CONQUERORS WEAPONS IN HAND HEARTS FILLED WITH LUST OF BLOOD TO THE CONTRARY WE ARE ON A PEACEFUL MISSION HOPING TO LEARN TRUSTING TO ENLIGHTEN WITH MALICE TOWARDS NONE
1851-151817-0022 GET A HUSTLE ON BOYS THE DAY IS WANING AND WITH SO MUCH TO SEE TO STUDY TO COME I SAY IN SPITE OF HIS INITIAL ATTEMPT TO IMPRESS HIS NEPHEWS WITH A DUE SENSE OF THE HEAVY RESPONSIBILITIES WHICH RESTED UPON THEM
1851-151817-0023 ERECTED BY THE HANDS OF A PEOPLE WHOM COMMON CONSENT HAD AGREED WERE LONG SINCE WIPED OUT OF EXISTENCE THE STORY TOLD BY COOPER EDGECOMBE BACKED UP BY THE ARTICLES TAKEN FROM THE PERSON OF THE WARRIOR
1851-151817-0024 WHOM HE HAD SLAIN IN SELF DEFENCE CERTAINLY HAD ITS WEIGHT WHILE THE BRIEF AND IMPERFECT GLIMPSE WHICH HE HAD WON OF YONDER VALLEY HELPED TO BEAR OUT THAT ASTOUNDING BELIEF AND YET HOW COULD IT BE TRUE
1851-151817-0025 REALLY BELIEVING YET FORCED BY MORE SOBER REASON TO DOUBT THE POOR PROFESSOR WAS LITERALLY IN A SWEAT LONG ERE ANOTHER VIEW COULD BE WON OF THE DEPRESSED VALLEY ALTHOUGH THE LANDING OF THE AIR SHIP WAS SO WELL CHOSEN
1851-151817-0026 THE NATURAL OBSTACLES WERE CONSIDERABLE HOWEVER AND AS THEY PICKED THEIR WAY ALONG THE BROTHERS FOR THE FIRST TIME BEGAN TO GAIN A FAIRLY ACCURATE IDEA OF WHAT WAS MEANT BY THE TERM A VIRGIN FOREST
1851-151817-0027 TO ALL SEEMING THE HUMAN FOOT HAD NEVER VENTURED HERE NOR WERE ANY MARKS OR SPOOR OF WILD BEASTS PERCEPTIBLE ON EITHER SIDE ALTHOUGH THE AEROSTAT HAD LANDED NOT FAR BELOW THE CREST OF THOSE HILLS
1851-151817-0028 THE ADVENTURERS HAD TO CLIMB HIGHER BEFORE WINNING THE COVETED VIEW PARTLY BECAUSE THE MOST PRACTICABLE ROUTE LED DOWN INTO AND ALONG A WINDING GULCH WHERE THE FOOTING WAS FAR LESS TREACHEROUS THAN UPON THE HIGHER GROUND
1851-151817-0029 CUMBERED AS THAT WAS WITH THE LEAF MOULD OF CENTURIES STILL HALF AN HOUR'S STEADY LABOUR BROUGHT THE LITTLE SQUAD TO THE COVETED POINT AND ONCE AGAIN PROFESSOR FEATHERWIT WAS ALMOST LITERALLY STRICKEN SPEECHLESS FOR THERE
1851-151817-0030 FAR BELOW THEIR PRESENT LOCATION SPREAD OUT IN LEVEL EXPANSE LAY THE SECRET VALLEY WITH ALL ITS MARVELS FAR MORE EXTENSIVE THAN IT HAD APPEARED BY THAT INITIAL GLIMPSE
1851-151817-0031 THE VALLEY ITSELF SEEMED COMPOSED OF FERTILE SOIL YET BY AID OF THE RIVER WHICH CUT THROUGH NEAR ITS CENTRE IRRIGATING DITCHES CONVEYED WATER TO EVERY ACRE THUS ENSURING BOUNTEOUS CROPS OF GRAIN AND OF FRUIT AS WELL
1851-151817-0032 NUMEROUS BUILDINGS STOOD IN IRREGULAR ARRAY FOR THE MOST PART OF NO GREAT HEIGHT NOR WITH MANY PRETENSIONS TOWARDS ARCHITECTURAL BEAUTY OR GRACE OF OUTLINE BUT IN THE CENTRE OF THE VALLEY UPREARED ITS HEAD A MASSIVE STRUCTURE
1851-151817-0033 PYRAMIDAL IN SHAPE CONSISTING OF FIVE COMPARATIVELY NARROW TERRACES CONNECTED ONE WITH ANOTHER ONLY AT EACH OF THE FOUR CORNERS WHERE STOOD A WIDE STEPPED FLIGHT OF STONES BEHOLD
1851-151817-0034 AND LOOK THE PEOPLE ARE THEY WEAR JUST SUCH GARB AS OH MARVELLOUS AMAZING ASTOUNDING INCREDIBLE YET TRUE ALTHOUGH THEIR UNCLE COULD THUS TAKE IN THE VARIOUS DETAILS TO BETTER ADVANTAGE
1851-151817-0035 STILL THE INTERVENING DISTANCE WAS NOT SO GREAT AS TO ENTIRELY DEBAR THE BROTHERS FROM FINDING NO LITTLE TO INTEREST THEM AS WAS READILY PROVEN BY THEIR VARIOUS EXCLAMATIONS
1851-151817-0036 OR WATCHING FOR THE MONSTER BIRD OF PREY RATHER SUGGESTED THE ELDER GILLESPIE OF COURSE THEY COULDN'T DISTINGUISH OUR FACES AND OUR BODIES WERE FAIRLY WELL HIDDEN AND EVEN MORE OF COURSE THEY MUST BE TOTALLY IGNORANT OF ALL SUCH THINGS AS FLYING MACHINES AND THE LIKE
1851-151817-0037 SYMPATHETICALLY SIGHED THE YOUNGSTER WELL WE'LL HAVE TO DO A LITTLE MISSIONARY WORK IN THIS QUARTER BEFORE TAKING OUR DEPARTURE EH UNCLE PHAETON WITH A START
1851-151817-0038 FEATHERWIT DESCENDED OUT OF THE CLOUDS IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN LOST EVER SINCE WINNING A FAIR VIEW OF THE SECRET CITY AND NOW RALLYING HIS WITS AND FAIRLY AGLOW WITH EAGER INTEREST IN THIS MARVELLOUS DISCOVERY
1851-151817-0039 HE BEGAN POINTING OUT THE VARIOUS OBJECTS OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE NAMING THEM WITH GLIB ASSURANCE THEN REMINDING THE BOYS HOW WONDERFULLY SIMILAR ALL WAS TO WHAT HAD EXISTED IN OLD MEXICO BEFORE THE CONQUEST
1851-151817-0040 WAS ABLE TO CLOSELY FOLLOW THE COURSE OF THAT LITTLE LECTURE NOTING EACH STRONG POINT MADE BY THE PROFESSOR IN BOLSTERING UP HIS DELIGHTFUL THEORY
