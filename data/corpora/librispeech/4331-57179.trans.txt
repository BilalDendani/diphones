4331-57179-0000 THAN SHE HAD PROBABLY EVER PAID TO ANY MATTER UP TO THAT TIME
4331-57179-0001 BUT NEVER SO MUCH IN EARNEST AS NOW THOSE OTHER MEN HAD PERHAPS BEEN WORTHY WORTHY AS FAR AS HER IDEAS WENT OF WORTH
4331-57179-0002 EVERYTHING WAS THERE IF SHE COULD ONLY GET IT MONEY RANK FASHION AND AN APPETITE FOR PLEASURE AND HE WAS HANDSOME TOO AND GOOD HUMOURED THOUGH THESE QUALITIES TOLD LESS WITH HER THAN THE OTHERS
4331-57179-0003 AND NOW SHE WAS TO MEET HIM IN THE HOUSE OF HER GREAT RELATIONS IN A POSITION IN WHICH HER RANK AND HER FASHION WOULD SEEM TO BE EQUAL TO HIS OWN AND SHE WOULD MEET HIM WITH THE REMEMBRANCE FRESH IN HIS MIND AS IN HER OWN OF THOSE PASSAGES OF LOVE AT RUFFORD
4331-57179-0004 IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD EVEN SEEM TO FORGET THEM THE MOST THAT SHE COULD EXPECT WOULD BE FOUR OR FIVE DAYS OF HIS COMPANY AND SHE KNEW THAT SHE MUST BE UPON HER METTLE SHE MUST DO MORE NOW
4331-57179-0005 SHE MUST SCRUPLE AT NOTHING THAT MIGHT BIND HIM SHE WOULD BE IN THE HOUSE OF HER UNCLE AND THAT UNCLE A DUKE
4331-57179-0006 SHE THOUGHT OF IT ALL AND MADE HER PLANS CAREFULLY AND EVEN PAINFULLY
4331-57179-0007 DURING THAT TIME SHE WOULD CURRY FAVOUR WITH HER UNCLE BY ALL HER ARTS AND WOULD IF POSSIBLE RECONCILE HERSELF TO HER AUNT SHE THOUGHT ONCE OF TAKING HER AUNT INTO HER FULL CONFIDENCE AND BALANCED THE MATTER MUCH IN HER MIND
4331-57179-0008 THE DUCHESS SHE KNEW WAS AFRAID OF HER OR RATHER AFRAID OF THE RELATIONSHIP AND WOULD OF COURSE BE PLEASED TO HAVE ALL FEARS SET AT REST BY SUCH AN ALLIANCE BUT HER AUNT WAS A WOMAN WHO HAD NEVER SUFFERED HARDSHIPS
4331-57179-0009 WHOSE OWN MARRIAGE HAD BEEN EASILY ARRANGED AND WHOSE TWO DAUGHTERS HAD BEEN PLEASANTLY MARRIED BEFORE THEY WERE TWENTY YEARS OLD
4331-57179-0010 BUT SHE COULD NOT VENTURE TO ASK FOR IT SHE HAD STRETCHED HER MEANS AND HER CREDIT TO THE UTMOST IN REGARD TO HER WARDROBE AND WAS AWARE THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SO WELL EQUIPPED SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS OF HER CAREER
4331-57179-0011 IN WHICH HER FATHER AND MOTHER HAD THOUGHT THAT HER BEAUTY ASSISTED BY A GENEROUS EXPENDITURE WOULD SERVE TO DISPOSE OF HER WITHOUT DELAY A GENEROUS EXPENDITURE MAY BE INCURRED ONCE EVEN BY POOR PEOPLE BUT CANNOT POSSIBLY BE MAINTAINED OVER A DOZEN YEARS
4331-57179-0012 NOW SHE HAD TAKEN THE MATTER INTO HER OWN HANDS AND HAD DONE THAT WHICH WOULD BE RUINOUS IF NOT SUCCESSFUL
4331-57179-0013 WITH THE PROSPECT OF DROWNING HERSELF ON THE WAY OUT TO PATAGONIA SHOULD THE CHANCES OF THE GAME GO AGAINST HER SHE FORGOT NOTHING SHE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR MORE THAN ONE DAY'S HUNTING AND YET THAT HAD BEEN PROVIDED FOR AS THOUGH SHE WERE GOING TO RIDE WITH THE HOUNDS THROUGH ALL THE REMAINDER OF THE SEASON
4331-57179-0014 WHEN SHE REACHED MISTLETOE THERE WERE PEOPLE GOING AND COMING EVERY DAY SO THAT AN ARRIVAL WAS NO EVENT SHE WAS KISSED BY HER UNCLE AND WELCOMED WITH CHARACTERISTIC COLDNESS BY HER AUNT THEN ALLOWED TO SETTLE IN AMONG THE OTHER GUESTS
4331-57179-0015 EVERYBODY KNEW THAT SHE WAS A TREFOIL AND HER PRESENCE THEREFORE RAISED NO QUESTION THE DUCHESS OF OMNIUM WAS AMONG THE GUESTS THE DUCHESS KNEW ALL ABOUT HER AND VOUCHSAFED TO HER THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE RECOGNITION LADY CHILTERN HAD MET HER BEFORE
4331-57179-0016 AND AS LADY CHILTERN WAS ALWAYS GENEROUS SHE WAS GRACIOUS TO ARABELLA SHE WAS SORRY TO SEE LADY DRUMMOND BECAUSE SHE CONNECTED LADY DRUMMOND WITH THE FOREIGN OFFICE AND FEARED THAT THE CONVERSATION MIGHT BE LED TO PATAGONIA AND ITS NEW MINISTER
4331-57179-0017 THE GIRL WAS HIS NIECE AND THE DUKE HAD AN IDEA THAT HE SHOULD BE KIND TO THE FAMILY OF WHICH HE WAS THE HEAD HIS BROTHER'S WIFE HAD BECOME OBJECTIONABLE TO HIM BUT AS TO THE GIRL IF SHE WANTED A HOME FOR A WEEK OR TWO HE THOUGHT IT TO BE HIS DUTY TO GIVE IT TO HER
4331-57179-0018 MISTLETOE IS AN ENORMOUS HOUSE WITH A FRONTAGE NEARLY A QUARTER OF A MILE LONG COMBINING AS IT DOES ALL THE OFFICES COACH HOUSES AND STABLES THERE IS NOTHING IN ENGLAND MORE UGLY OR PERHAPS MORE COMFORTABLE
4331-57179-0019 AND SIX IN LONDON IN WHICH HE GAVE DINNERS AND DINED OUT AND REGULARLY TOOK HIS PLACE IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS WITHOUT EVER OPENING HIS MOUTH HE WAS A GREY HAIRED COMELY MAN OF SIXTY WITH A LARGE BODY AND A WONDERFUL APPETITE
4331-57179-0020 BY MANY WHO UNDERSTOOD THE SUBJECT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST AMATEUR JUDGE OF WINE IN ENGLAND
4331-57179-0021 AT ALL POINTS LORD MISTLETOE WHO HAD A LARGE FAMILY OF HIS OWN LIVED TWENTY MILES OFF SO THAT THE FATHER AND SON COULD MEET PLEASANTLY WITHOUT FEAR OF QUARRELLING DURING THE FIRST EVENING ARABELLA DID CONTRIVE TO MAKE HERSELF VERY AGREEABLE
4331-57179-0022 SHE WAS MUCH QUIETER THAN HAD BEEN HER WONT WHEN AT MISTLETOE BEFORE AND THOUGH THERE WERE PRESENT TWO OR THREE VERY WELL CIRCUMSTANCED YOUNG MEN SHE TOOK BUT LITTLE NOTICE OF THEM SHE WENT OUT TO DINNER WITH SIR JEFFREY BUNKER
4331-57179-0023 AND MADE HERSELF AGREEABLE TO THAT OLD GENTLEMAN IN A REMARKABLE MANNER AFTER DINNER SOMETHING HAVING BEEN SAID OF THE RESPECTABLE OLD GAME CALLED CAT'S CRADLE SHE PLAYED IT TO PERFECTION WITH SIR JEFFREY TILL HER AUNT THOUGHT THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN UNAWARE
4331-57179-0024 THAT SIR JEFFREY HAD A WIFE AND FAMILY SHE WAS ALL SMILES AND ALL PLEASANTNESS AND SEEMED TO WANT NO OTHER HAPPINESS THAN WHAT THE PRESENT MOMENT GAVE HER NOR DID SHE ONCE MENTION LORD RUFFORD'S NAME ON THE NEXT MORNING AFTER BREAKFAST HER AUNT SENT FOR HER TO COME UP STAIRS
4331-57179-0025 SUCH A THING HAD NEVER HAPPENED TO HER BEFORE SHE COULD NOT RECOLLECT THAT ON ANY OF THOSE ANNUAL VISITS WHICH SHE HAD MADE TO MISTLETOE FOR MORE YEARS THAN SHE NOW LIKED TO THINK OF SHE HAD EVER HAD FIVE MINUTES CONVERSATION ALONE WITH HER AUNT
4331-57179-0026 THE MESSAGE WAS WHISPERED INTO HER EAR BY HER AUNT'S OWN WOMAN AS SHE WAS LISTENING WITH GREAT ATTENTION TO LADY DRUMMOND'S TROUBLES IN REGARD TO HER NURSERY ARRANGEMENTS SHE NODDED HER HEAD
4331-57179-0027 THAT HER AUNT WANTED HER FOLLOWED THE MAID UP STAIRS MY DEAR SAID HER AUNT WHEN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED I WANT TO ASK YOU WHETHER YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO ASK MISTER MORTON TO COME HERE WHILE YOU ARE WITH US
4331-57179-0028 A THUNDERBOLT AT HER FEET COULD HARDLY HAVE SURPRISED OR ANNOYED HER MORE IF THERE WAS ONE THING THAT SHE WANTED LESS THAN ANOTHER IT WAS THE PRESENCE OF THE PARAGON AT MISTLETOE IT WOULD UTTERLY SUBVERT EVERYTHING AND ROB HER OF EVERY CHANCE
4331-57179-0029 WITH A GREAT EFFORT SHE RESTRAINED ALL EMOTION AND SIMPLY SHOOK HER HEAD SHE DID IT VERY WELL AND BETRAYED NOTHING I ASK SAID THE DUCHESS BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU ARE ENGAGED TO MARRY HIM LORD DRUMMOND TELLS ME THAT HE IS A MOST RESPECTABLE YOUNG MAN
4331-57179-0030 MISTER MORTON WILL BE SO MUCH OBLIGED TO LORD DRUMMOND AND I THOUGHT THAT IF IT WERE SO YOU WOULD BE GLAD THAT HE SHOULD MEET YOU HERE I COULD MANAGE IT VERY WELL AS THE DRUMMONDS ARE HERE AND LORD DRUMMOND WOULD BE GLAD TO MEET HIM
4331-57179-0031 BUT STILL BY THE TIME THAT SHE WAS CALLED ON TO SPEAK SHE HAD FABRICATED HER STORY THANKS AUNT IT IS SO GOOD OF YOU AND IF EVERYTHING WAS GOING STRAIGHT THERE WOULD BE NOTHING OF COURSE THAT I SHOULD LIKE SO MUCH
4331-57179-0032 BUT PAPA AND MAMMA AND THE LAWYERS THINK THAT HE IS NOT BEHAVING WELL ABOUT MONEY
4331-57179-0033 WOULD KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MISTER MORTON AND NOW SHE WAS CALLED UPON TO ANSWER THESE HORRID QUESTIONS WITHOUT A MOMENT'S NOTICE I DON'T THINK I SHALL GO WITH HIM AUNT THOUGH I AM UNABLE TO SAY ANYTHING CERTAIN JUST AT PRESENT
4331-57179-0034 I HOPE NOT YOU SHOULD THINK OF IT VERY SERIOUSLY AS FOR MONEY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE NONE OF YOUR OWN AND I AM TOLD THAT HE HAS A VERY NICE PROPERTY IN RUFFORD THERE IS A NEIGHBOUR OF HIS COMING HERE TO MORROW AND PERHAPS HE KNOWS HIM WHO IS THE NEIGHBOUR AUNT
4331-57179-0035 ASKED ARABELLA INNOCENTLY LORD RUFFORD HE IS COMING TO SHOOT I WILL ASK HIM ABOUT THE PROPERTY
4331-57179-0036 I KNOW LORD RUFFORD VERY WELL KNOW LORD RUFFORD VERY WELL AS ONE DOES KNOW MEN THAT ONE MEETS ABOUT I THOUGHT IT MIGHT SETTLE EVERYTHING IF WE HAD MISTER MORTON HERE I COULDN'T MEET HIM AUNT I COULDN'T INDEED
4331-57179-0037 TO THE DUCHESS CONDEMNATION FROM LADY AUGUSTUS ALMOST AMOUNTED TO PRAISE SHE FELT SURE THAT MISTER MORTON WAS A WORTHY MAN WHO WOULD NOT PROBABLY BEHAVE BADLY AND THOUGH SHE COULD NOT UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY AND CERTAINLY HAD NO SUSPICION IN REGARD TO LORD RUFFORD
4331-57179-0038 SHE WAS SURE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG BUT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID AT PRESENT AFTER WHAT ARABELLA HAD TOLD HER MISTER MORTON COULD NOT BE ASKED THERE TO MEET HER NIECE BUT ALL THE SLIGHT FEELING OF KINDNESS TO THE GIRL WHICH HAD BEEN CREATED BY THE TIDINGS OF SO RESPECTABLE AN ENGAGEMENT
4331-57179-0039 WERE AT ONCE OBLITERATED FROM THE DUCHESS'S BOSOM ARABELLA WITH MANY EXPRESSIONS OF THANKS AND A GOOD HUMOURED COUNTENANCE LEFT THE ROOM CURSING THE UNTOWARDNESS OF HER FATE WHICH WOULD LET NOTHING RUN SMOOTH LORD RUFFORD WAS TO COME THAT AT ANY RATE WAS NOW ALMOST CERTAIN
4331-57179-0040 UP TO THE PRESENT SHE HAD DOUBTED KNOWING THE WAY IN WHICH SUCH MEN WILL CHANGE THEIR ENGAGEMENTS AT THE LEAST CAPRICE BUT THE DUCHESS EXPECTED HIM ON THE MORROW
4331-57179-0041 SHE HAD PREPARED THE WAY FOR MEETING HIM AS AN OLD FRIEND WITHOUT CAUSING SURPRISE AND HAD GAINED THAT STEP BUT SHOULD SHE SUCCEED AS SHE HOPED
4331-57179-0042 IN EXACTING CONTINUED HOMAGE FROM THE MAN HOMAGE FOR THE FOUR OR FIVE DAYS OF HIS SOJOURN AT MISTLETOE THIS MUST BE CARRIED ON WITH THE KNOWLEDGE ON THE PART OF MANY IN THE HOUSE THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED TO THAT HORRID PATAGONIAN MINISTER
4331-57179-0043 WAS EVER A GIRL CALLED UPON TO RISK HER ENTIRE FATE UNDER SO MANY DISADVANTAGES WHEN SHE WENT UP TO DRESS FOR DINNER ON THE DAY OF HIS EXPECTED ARRIVAL LORD RUFFORD HAD NOT COME SINCE THE INTERVIEW IN HER AUNT'S ROOM SHE HAD NOT HEARD HIS NAME MENTIONED
4331-57179-0044 WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM A LITTLE LATE HE WAS NOT THERE WE WON'T WAIT DUCHESS SAID THE DUKE TO HIS WIFE AT THREE MINUTES PAST EIGHT THE DUKE'S PUNCTUALITY AT DINNER TIME WAS WELL KNOWN AND EVERYBODY ELSE WAS THEN ASSEMBLED
4331-57179-0045 WITHIN TWO MINUTES AFTER THE DUKE'S WORD DINNER WAS ANNOUNCED AND A PARTY NUMBERING ABOUT THIRTY WALKED AWAY INTO THE DINNER ROOM ARABELLA WHEN THEY WERE ALL SETTLED FOUND THAT THERE WAS A VACANT SEAT NEXT HERSELF IF THE MAN WERE TO COME FORTUNE WOULD HAVE FAVOURED HER IN THAT
4331-57179-0046 THE FISH AND SOUP HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED AND THE DUKE WAS WAKENING HIMSELF TO ELOQUENCE ON THE FIRST ENTREE WHEN LORD RUFFORD ENTERED THE ROOM
4331-57179-0047 NOR ANY PART OF THE WORLD IN WHICH HIRED HORSES TRAVEL SO SLOWLY I BEG THE DUKE'S PARDON BUT I SUFFER THE LESS BECAUSE I KNOW HIS GRACE NEVER WAITS FOR ANYBODY CERTAINLY NOT SAID THE DUKE HAVING SOME REGARD FOR MY FRIENDS DINNERS
4331-57179-0048 AND I FIND MYSELF NEXT TO YOU SAID LORD RUFFORD AS HE TOOK HIS SEAT
