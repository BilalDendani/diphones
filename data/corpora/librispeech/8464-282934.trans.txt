8464-282934-0000 CALLIOPE CATESBY WAS IN HIS HUMOURS AGAIN
8464-282934-0001 THIS GOODLY PROMONTORY THE EARTH
8464-282934-0002 WAS TO HIM NO MORE THAN A PESTILENT CONGREGATION OF VAPOURS OVERTAKEN BY THE MEGRIMS THE PHILOSOPHER MAY SEEK RELIEF IN SOLILOQUY MY LADY FIND SOLACE IN TEARS THE FLACCID EASTERNER
8464-282934-0003 SCOLD AT THE MILLINERY BILLS OF HIS WOMEN FOLK SUCH RECOURSE WAS INSUFFICIENT TO THE DENIZENS OF QUICKSAND CALLIOPE ESPECIALLY
8464-282934-0004 ACCORDING TO HIS LIGHTS OVER NIGHT CALLIOPE HAD HUNG OUT SIGNALS OF APPROACHING LOW SPIRITS
8464-282934-0005 AND REFUSED TO APOLOGISE
8464-282934-0006 WHILE STROLLING ABOUT HE REACHED OFTEN FOR TWIGS OF MESQUITE AND CHEWED THE LEAVES FIERCELY THAT WAS ALWAYS AN OMINOUS ACT ANOTHER SYMPTOM ALARMING TO THOSE WHO WERE FAMILIAR WITH THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF HIS DOLDRUMS
8464-282934-0007 WAS HIS INCREASING POLITENESS AND A TENDENCY TO USE FORMAL PHRASES A HUSKY SOFTNESS SUCCEEDED THE USUAL PENETRATING DRAWL IN HIS TONES A DANGEROUS COURTESY MARKED HIS MANNERS LATER
8464-282934-0008 HIS SMILE BECAME CROOKED THE LEFT SIDE OF HIS MOUTH SLANTING UPWARD AND QUICKSAND GOT READY TO STAND FROM UNDER AT THIS STAGE CALLIOPE GENERALLY BEGAN TO DRINK FINALLY ABOUT MIDNIGHT
8464-282934-0009 HE WAS SEEN GOING HOMEWARD SALUTING THOSE WHOM HE MET WITH EXAGGERATED BUT INOFFENSIVE COURTESY NOT YET WAS CALLIOPE'S MELANCHOLY AT THE DANGER POINT
8464-282934-0010 HE WOULD SEAT HIMSELF AT THE WINDOW OF THE ROOM HE OCCUPIED OVER SILVESTER'S TONSORIAL PARLOURS AND THERE CHANT LUGUBRIOUS AND TUNELESS BALLADS UNTIL MORNING ACCOMPANYING THE NOISES BY APPROPRIATE MALTREATMENT
8464-282934-0011 OF A JANGLING GUITAR MORE MAGNANIMOUS THAN NERO HE WOULD THUS GIVE MUSICAL WARNING OF THE FORTHCOMING MUNICIPAL UPHEAVAL THAT QUICKSAND WAS SCHEDULED TO ENDURE
8464-282934-0012 QUIET TO INDOLENCE AND AMIABLE TO WORTHLESSNESS AT BEST HE WAS A LOAFER AND A NUISANCE AT WORST HE WAS THE TERROR OF QUICKSAND HIS OSTENSIBLE OCCUPATION WAS SOMETHING SUBORDINATE IN THE REAL ESTATE LINE
8464-282934-0013 HE DROVE THE BEGUILED EASTERNER IN BUCKBOARDS OUT TO LOOK OVER LOTS AND RANCH PROPERTY ORIGINALLY HE CAME FROM ONE OF THE GULF STATES HIS LANK SIX FEET SLURRING RHYTHM OF SPEECH AND SECTIONAL IDIOMS GIVING EVIDENCE OF HIS BIRTHPLACE
8464-282934-0014 AND YET AFTER TAKING ON WESTERN ADJUSTMENTS THIS LANGUID PINE BOX WHITTLER CRACKER BARREL HUGGER SHADY CORNER LOUNGER OF THE COTTON FIELDS AND SUMAC HILLS OF THE SOUTH BECAME FAMED AS A BAD MAN AMONG MEN
8464-282934-0015 AT NINE THE NEXT MORNING CALLIOPE WAS FIT INSPIRED BY HIS OWN BARBAROUS MELODIES AND THE CONTENTS OF HIS JUG HE WAS READY PRIMED TO GATHER FRESH LAURELS FROM THE DIFFIDENT BROW OF QUICKSAND
8464-282934-0016 ENCIRCLED AND CRISS CROSSED WITH CARTRIDGE BELTS ABUNDANTLY GARNISHED WITH REVOLVERS AND COPIOUSLY DRUNK HE POURED FORTH INTO QUICKSAND'S MAIN STREET TOO CHIVALROUS TO SURPRISE AND CAPTURE A TOWN BY SILENT SORTIE
8464-282934-0017 HE PAUSED AT THE NEAREST CORNER AND EMITTED HIS SLOGAN THAT FEARFUL BRASSY YELL SO REMINISCENT OF THE STEAM PIANO THAT HAD GAINED FOR HIM THE CLASSIC APPELLATION THAT HAD SUPERSEDED HIS OWN BAPTISMAL NAME
8464-282934-0018 FOLLOWING CLOSE UPON HIS VOCIFERATION CAME THREE SHOTS FROM HIS FORTY FIVE BY WAY OF LIMBERING UP THE GUNS AND TESTING HIS AIM
8464-282934-0019 WAS STIMULATED TO A SUDDEN AND ADMIRABLE BURST OF SPEED STILL GRASPING THE NECK OF THE SHATTERED BOTTLE THE NEW GILT WEATHER COCK ON JUDGE RILEY'S LEMON AND ULTRAMARINE TWO STORY RESIDENCE SHIVERED FLAPPED AND HUNG BY A SPLINTER
8464-282934-0020 THE SPORT OF THE WANTON BREEZES THE ARTILLERY WAS IN TRIM CALLIOPE'S HAND WAS STEADY THE HIGH CALM ECSTASY OF HABITUAL BATTLE WAS UPON HIM THOUGH SLIGHTLY EMBITTERED BY THE SADNESS OF ALEXANDER
8464-282934-0021 IN THAT HIS CONQUESTS WERE LIMITED TO THE SMALL WORLD OF QUICKSAND DOWN THE STREET WENT CALLIOPE SHOOTING RIGHT AND LEFT GLASS FELL LIKE HAIL DOGS VAMOSED CHICKENS FLEW SQUAWKING
8464-282934-0022 AND WAS DROWNED PERIODICALLY BY THE BRAZEN SCREECH THAT QUICKSAND KNEW SO WELL THE OCCASIONS OF CALLIOPE'S LOW SPIRITS WERE LEGAL HOLIDAYS IN QUICKSAND ALL ALONG THE MAIN STREET IN ADVANCE OF HIS COMING
8464-282934-0023 CLERKS WERE PUTTING UP SHUTTERS AND CLOSING DOORS BUSINESS WOULD LANGUISH FOR A SPACE THE RIGHT OF WAY WAS CALLIOPE'S AND AS HE ADVANCED OBSERVING THE DEARTH OF OPPOSITION AND THE FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISTRACTION
8464-282934-0024 PERCEPTIBLY INCREASED BUT SOME FOUR SQUARES FARTHER DOWN LIVELY PREPARATIONS WERE BEING MADE TO MINISTER TO MISTER CATESBY'S LOVE FOR INTERCHANGE OF COMPLIMENTS AND REPARTEE
8464-282934-0025 ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT NUMEROUS MESSENGERS HAD HASTENED TO ADVISE BUCK PATTERSON THE CITY MARSHAL OF CALLIOPE'S IMPENDING ERUPTION THE PATIENCE OF THAT OFFICIAL
8464-282934-0026 OFTEN STRAINED IN EXTENDING LENIENCY TOWARD THE DISTURBER'S MISDEEDS HAD BEEN OVERTAXED IN QUICKSAND SOME INDULGENCE WAS ACCORDED THE NATURAL EBULLITION OF HUMAN NATURE
8464-282934-0027 PROVIDING THAT THE LIVES OF THE MORE USEFUL CITIZENS WERE NOT RECKLESSLY SQUANDERED OR TOO MUCH PROPERTY NEEDLESSLY LAID WASTE THE COMMUNITY SENTIMENT WAS AGAINST A TOO STRICT ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW BUT CALLIOPE HAD RAISED THE LIMIT
8464-282934-0028 HIS OUTBURSTS HAD BEEN TOO FREQUENT AND TOO VIOLENT TO COME WITHIN THE CLASSIFICATION OF A NORMAL AND SANITARY RELAXATION OF SPIRIT
8464-282934-0029 BUCK PATTERSON HAD BEEN EXPECTING AND AWAITING IN HIS LITTLE TEN BY TWELVE FRAME OFFICE THAT PRELIMINARY YELL ANNOUNCING THAT CALLIOPE WAS FEELING BLUE
8464-282934-0030 WHEN THE SIGNAL CAME THE CITY MARSHAL ROSE TO HIS FEET AND BUCKLED ON HIS GUNS TWO DEPUTY SHERIFFS AND THREE CITIZENS WHO HAD PROVEN THE EDIBLE QUALITIES OF FIRE ALSO STOOD UP
8464-282934-0031 READY TO BANDY WITH CALLIOPE'S LEADEN JOCULARITIES GATHER THAT FELLOW IN SAID BUCK PATTERSON SETTING FORTH THE LINES OF THE CAMPAIGN DON'T HAVE NO TALK BUT SHOOT AS SOON AS YOU CAN GET A SHOW
8464-282934-0032 KEEP BEHIND COVER AND BRING HIM DOWN HE'S A NOGOOD UN IT'S UP TO CALLIOPE TO TURN UP HIS TOES THIS TIME I RECKON GO TO HIM ALL SPRADDLED OUT BOYS AND DON'T GIT TOO RECKLESS
8464-282934-0033 HE HITS BUCK PATTERSON TALL MUSCULAR AND SOLEMN FACED WITH HIS BRIGHT CITY MARSHAL BADGE SHINING ON THE BREAST OF HIS BLUE FLANNEL SHIRT GAVE HIS POSSE DIRECTIONS FOR THE ONSLAUGHT UPON CALLIOPE
8464-282934-0034 THE PLAN WAS TO ACCOMPLISH THE DOWNFALL OF THE QUICKSAND TERROR WITHOUT LOSS TO THE ATTACKING PARTY IF POSSIBLE THE SPLENETIC CALLIOPE UNCONSCIOUS OF RETRIBUTIVE PLOTS WAS STEAMING DOWN THE CHANNEL
8464-282934-0035 CANNONADING ON EITHER SIDE WHEN HE SUDDENLY BECAME AWARE OF BREAKERS AHEAD
8464-282934-0036 AND OPENED FIRE AT THE SAME TIME THE REST OF THE POSSE DIVIDED SHELLED HIM FROM TWO SIDE STREETS UP WHICH THEY WERE CAUTIOUSLY MANOEUVRING FROM A WELL EXECUTED DETOUR THE FIRST VOLLEY BROKE THE LOCK OF ONE OF CALLIOPE'S GUNS
8464-282934-0037 CUT A NEAT UNDERBIT IN HIS RIGHT EAR AND EXPLODED A CARTRIDGE IN HIS CROSSBELT SCORCHING HIS RIBS AS IT BURST FEELING BRACED UP BY THIS UNEXPECTED TONIC TO HIS SPIRITUAL DEPRESSION
8464-282934-0038 CALLIOPE EXECUTED A FORTISSIMO NOTE FROM HIS UPPER REGISTER AND RETURNED THE FIRE LIKE AN ECHO
8464-282934-0039 BUT A TRIFLE TOO LATE TO SAVE ONE OF THE DEPUTIES A BULLET JUST ABOVE THE ELBOW AND THE MARSHAL A BLEEDING CHEEK FROM A SPLINTER THAT A BALL TORE FROM THE BOX HE HAD DUCKED BEHIND
8464-282934-0040 CHOOSING WITH A RAPID EYE THE STREET FROM WHICH THE WEAKEST AND LEAST ACCURATE FIRE HAD COME HE INVADED IT AT A DOUBLE QUICK ABANDONING THE UNPROTECTED MIDDLE OF THE STREET WITH RARE CUNNING THE OPPOSING FORCE IN THAT DIRECTION
8464-282934-0041 ONE OF THE DEPUTIES AND TWO OF THE VALOROUS VOLUNTEERS WAITED CONCEALED BY BEER BARRELS UNTIL CALLIOPE HAD PASSED THEIR RETREAT AND THEN PEPPERED HIM FROM THE REAR IN ANOTHER MOMENT THEY WERE REINFORCED BY THE MARSHAL AND HIS OTHER MEN
8464-282934-0042 AND THEN CALLIOPE FELT THAT IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY PROLONG THE DELIGHTS OF THE CONTROVERSY HE MUST FIND SOME MEANS OF REDUCING THE GREAT ODDS AGAINST HIM HIS EYE FELL UPON A STRUCTURE THAT SEEMED TO HOLD OUT THIS PROMISE PROVIDING HE COULD REACH IT
8464-282934-0043 NOT FAR AWAY WAS THE LITTLE RAILROAD STATION ITS BUILDING A STRONG BOX HOUSE TEN BY TWENTY FEET RESTING UPON A PLATFORM FOUR FEET ABOVE GROUND WINDOWS WERE IN EACH OF ITS WALLS
8464-282934-0044 SOMETHING LIKE A FORT IT MIGHT BECOME TO A MAN THUS SORELY PRESSED BY SUPERIOR NUMBERS CALLIOPE MADE A BOLD AND RAPID SPURT FOR IT THE MARSHAL'S CROWD SMOKING HIM AS HE RAN HE REACHED THE HAVEN IN SAFETY
8464-282934-0045 THE STATION AGENT LEAVING THE BUILDING BY A WINDOW LIKE A FLYING SQUIRREL AS THE GARRISON ENTERED THE DOOR PATTERSON AND HIS SUPPORTERS HALTED UNDER PROTECTION OF A PILE OF LUMBER AND HELD CONSULTATIONS IN THE STATION WAS AN UNTERRIFIED DESPERADO
8464-282934-0046 WHO WAS AN EXCELLENT SHOT AND CARRIED AN ABUNDANCE OF AMMUNITION FOR THIRTY YARDS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BESIEGED WAS A STRETCH OF BARE OPEN GROUND IT WAS A SURE THING THAT THE MAN WHO ATTEMPTED TO ENTER THAT UNPROTECTED AREA
8464-282934-0047 WOULD BE STOPPED BY ONE OF CALLIOPE'S BULLETS THE CITY MARSHAL WAS RESOLVED HE HAD DECIDED THAT CALLIOPE CATESBY SHOULD NO MORE WAKE THE ECHOES OF QUICKSAND WITH HIS STRIDENT WHOOP HE HAD SO ANNOUNCED
8464-282934-0048 OFFICIALLY AND PERSONALLY HE FELT IMPERATIVELY BOUND TO PUT THE SOFT PEDAL ON THAT INSTRUMENT OF DISCORD IT PLAYED BAD TUNES STANDING NEAR WAS A HAND TRUCK USED IN THE MANIPULATION OF SMALL FREIGHT
8464-282934-0049 IT STOOD BY A SHED FULL OF SACKED WOOL A CONSIGNMENT FROM ONE OF THE SHEEP RANCHES ON THIS TRUCK THE MARSHAL AND HIS MEN PILED THREE HEAVY SACKS OF WOOL STOOPING LOW BUCK PATTERSON STARTED FOR CALLIOPE'S FORT
8464-282934-0050 SLOWLY PUSHING THIS LOADED TRUCK BEFORE HIM FOR PROTECTION THE POSSE SCATTERING BROADLY STOOD READY TO NIP THE BESIEGED IN CASE HE SHOULD SHOW HIMSELF IN AN EFFORT TO REPEL THE JUGGERNAUT OF JUSTICE THAT WAS CREEPING UPON HIM
8464-282934-0051 ONLY ONCE DID CALLIOPE MAKE DEMONSTRATION HE FIRED FROM A WINDOW AND SOME TUFTS OF WOOL SPURTED FROM THE MARSHAL'S TRUSTWORTHY BULWARK THE RETURN SHOTS FROM THE POSSE PATTERED AGAINST THE WINDOW FRAME OF THE FORT NO LOSS RESULTED
8464-282934-0052 ON EITHER SIDE THE MARSHAL WAS TOO DEEPLY ENGROSSED IN STEERING HIS PROTECTED BATTLESHIP TO BE AWARE OF THE APPROACH OF THE MORNING TRAIN UNTIL HE WAS WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE PLATFORM THE TRAIN WAS COMING UP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT
8464-282934-0053 WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY IT WOULD OFFER TO CALLIOPE HE HAD ONLY TO STEP OUT THE OTHER DOOR MOUNT THE TRAIN AND AWAY ABANDONING HIS BREASTWORK BUCK WITH HIS GUN READY DASHED UP THE STEPS AND INTO THE ROOM
8464-282934-0054 DRIVING UPON THE CLOSED DOOR WITH ONE HEAVE OF HIS WEIGHTY SHOULDER THE MEMBERS OF THE POSSE HEARD ONE SHOT FIRED INSIDE AND THEN THERE WAS SILENCE AT LENGTH THE WOUNDED MAN OPENED HIS EYES
8464-282934-0055 AFTER A BLANK SPACE HE AGAIN COULD SEE AND HEAR AND FEEL AND THINK TURNING HIS EYES ABOUT HE FOUND HIMSELF LYING ON A WOODEN BENCH A TALL MAN WITH A PERPLEXED COUNTENANCE WEARING A BIG BADGE WITH CITY MARSHAL ENGRAVED UPON IT STOOD OVER HIM
