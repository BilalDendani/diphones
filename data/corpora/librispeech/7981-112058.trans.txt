7981-112058-0000 MISSION WORK THE INCIDENT WHICH HAD GIVEN RISE TO VINCENT'S FIRST MISSION AT FOLLEVILLE HAD NEVER BEEN FORGOTTEN BY MADAME DE GONDI IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THERE WAS NEED TO MULTIPLY SUCH MISSIONS AMONG THE COUNTRY POOR
7981-112058-0001 TO ENDOW A BAND OF PRIESTS WHO WOULD DEVOTE THEIR LIVES TO EVANGELIZING THE PEASANTRY ON HER ESTATES VINCENT WAS DELIGHTED BUT CONSIDERING HIMSELF UNFIT TO UNDERTAKE THE MANAGEMENT OF SUCH AN ENTERPRISE HE PROPOSED THAT IT SHOULD BE PUT INTO THE HANDS OF THE JESUITS OR THE ORATORIANS
7981-112058-0002 MADAME DE GONDI ALTHOUGH CONVINCED IN HER OWN MIND THAT VINCENT AND VINCENT ALONE WAS THE MAN TO CARRY OUT THE ENTERPRISE OBEDIENTLY SUGGESTED IT TO ONE RELIGIOUS ORDER AFTER ANOTHER IN EVERY CASE SOME OBSTACLE INTERVENED
7981-112058-0003 UNTIL THE COUNTESS WAS MORE THAN EVER PERSUADED THAT HER FIRST INSTINCT HAD BEEN RIGHT KNOWING VINCENT'S LOYALTY TO HOLY CHURCH AND HIS OBEDIENCE TO AUTHORITY SHE DETERMINED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO HER BROTHER IN LAW THE ARCHBISHOP OF PARIS AN OLD HOUSE CALLED THE
7981-112058-0004 SHE ASKED IT OF THE ARCHBISHOP WHOM SHE HAD INTERESTED IN HER SCHEME AND WHO PROPOSED TO VINCENT TO UNDERTAKE THE FOUNDATION THERE WAS NO LONGER ROOM FOR HESITATION THE WILL OF GOD SEEMED PLAIN
7981-112058-0005 NINE MONTHS OF THE YEAR WERE TO BE GIVEN TO THIS KIND OF WORK THE OTHER THREE TO PRAYER AND PREPARATION IN MARCH SIXTEEN TWENTY FIVE THE FOUNDATION WAS MADE AND VINCENT DE PAUL WAS NAMED THE FIRST SUPERIOR
7981-112058-0006 IT WAS STIPULATED HOWEVER THAT HE SHOULD REMAIN AS HE HAD ALREADY PROMISED IN THE HOUSE OF THE FOUNDERS A CONDITION WHICH SEEMED LIKELY TO DOOM THE ENTERPRISE TO FAILURE
7981-112058-0007 THE SOLUTION WAS ALTOGETHER UNEXPECTED TWO MONTHS AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE CONTRACT OF FOUNDATION
7981-112058-0008 AND SHE DIED A FEW DAYS LATER
7981-112058-0009 BUT SHORTLY AFTERWARDS LEAVING THAT WORLD WHERE HE HAD SHONE SO BRILLIANTLY
7981-112058-0010 AND A POOR PRIEST WHO HAD LATELY JOINED THEM BEFORE SETTING OUT ON THEIR MISSION JOURNEYS THEY USED TO GIVE THE KEY OF THE HOUSE TO A NEIGHBOR BUT AS THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT TO STEAL THERE WAS LITTLE CAUSE FOR ANXIETY IN THE COURSE OF THEIR TRAVELS OTHER PRIESTS REALIZING THE GREATNESS OF THE WORK ASKED
7981-112058-0011 OUR LANGUAGE MUST BE CLEAR AND UNAFFECTED THE LOVE OF VIRTUE AND THE HATRED OF EVIL WERE THE POINTS TO BE INSISTED ON THE PEOPLE WERE TO BE SHOWN WHERE VIRTUE LAY AND HOW TO ATTAIN IT FOR FINE SERMONS VINCENT HAD THE GREATEST CONTEMPT
7981-112058-0012 HE WOULD USE HIS MERRY WIT TO MAKE FUN OF THE POMPOUS PREACHERS WHOSE ONLY THOUGHT WAS TO IMPRESS THEIR AUDIENCE WITH AN IDEA OF THEIR OWN ELOQUENCE OF WHAT GOOD IS A DISPLAY OF RHETORIC HE WOULD ASK WHO IS THE BETTER FOR IT IT SERVES NO PURPOSE BUT SELF ADVERTISEMENT
7981-112058-0013 THE MISSION PRIESTS DID GOOD WHEREVER THEY WENT EVERYBODY WANTED THEM
7981-112058-0014 BUT IN THE COURSE OF THEIR TRAVELS IT HAD BECOME PAINFULLY APPARENT THAT THE CLERGY THEMSELVES WERE IN URGENT NEED OF SOME AWAKENING FORCE THOSE OF GOOD FAMILY LED FOR THE MOST PART WORLDLY AND FRIVOLOUS LIVES WHILE THE HUMBLER SORT WERE AS IGNORANT AS THE PEASANTS AMONG WHOM THEY LIVED
7981-112058-0015 TO PRIESTS WHO WERE ABOUT TO BE ORDAINED HAD FALLEN INTO DISUSE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF SOME OF THE FRENCH BISHOPS HE DETERMINED TO REVIVE IT AND RETREATS OF TEN OR FOURTEEN DAYS WERE ORGANIZED AT SAINT LAZARE FOR CANDIDATES TO THE PRIESTHOOD
7981-112058-0016 FOR THEY ARE MORE LEARNED THAN YOU THEY HAVE READ OR HEARD IT ALL BEFORE IT IS BY WHAT THEY SEE OF YOUR LIVES THAT YOU WILL HELP THEM IF YOU YOURSELVES ARE STRIVING FOR PERFECTION GOD WILL USE YOU TO LEAD THESE GENTLEMEN IN THE RIGHT WAY
7981-112058-0017 THE BLESSING OF GOD SEEMED INDEED TO REST UPON THE ORDINATION RETREATS NEARLY ALL WHO MADE THEM CARRIED AWAY SOMETHING OF VINCENT'S NOBLE IDEAL OF THE PRIESTLY LIFE MANY TO WHOM THEY HAD BEEN THE TURNING POINT OF A LIFETIME
7981-112058-0018 FELT THE NEED OF FURTHER HELP AND INSTRUCTION FROM THE MAN WHO HAD AWAKENED ALL THAT WAS NOBLEST IN THEIR NATURES TO MEET THIS NECESSITY VINCENT INAUGURATED A KIND OF GUILD FOR YOUNG PRIESTS WHO DESIRE TO LIVE
7981-112058-0019 WEEKLY GATHERINGS WERE HELD AT SAINT LAZARE UNDER THE NAME OF TUESDAY CONFERENCES
7981-112058-0020 MEMBERS WERE PLEDGED TO OFFER THEIR LIVES COMPLETELY TO GOD AND TO RENOUNCE ALL SELF INTEREST NEVERTHELESS THEY INCREASED RAPIDLY IN NUMBER AND THE CONFERENCES WERE ATTENDED BY ALL THE MOST INFLUENTIAL PRIESTS IN PARIS
7981-112058-0021 HERE AS IN SO MANY OTHER CASES IT WAS THE CONGREGATION OF THE LADIES OF CHARITY FOUNDED BY VINCENT IN PARIS
7981-112058-0022 WHO LEFT A WIDOW AT THE AGE OF TWENTY DEVOTED HERSELF AND HER ENORMOUS FORTUNE TO ALMS AND GOOD WORKS
7981-112058-0023 AFTER THE MOVE TO SAINT LAZARE THE UNDERTAKING HAD GROWN AND PROSPERED
7981-112058-0024 AND THESE TWO INSTITUTIONS THE FIRST OF THE FAMOUS SEMINARIES WHICH WERE LATER TO SPREAD ALL OVER FRANCE WERE POWERFUL FOR THE REFORM OF THE CLERGY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS LATER THE MISSION PRIESTS OF SAINT LAZARE ALONE WERE AT THE HEAD OF SIXTY SUCH SEMINARIES
7981-112058-0025 SO THE WORK OF THE CONGREGATION INCREASED AND MULTIPLIED UNTIL IT SEEMED ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR HUMAN CAPACITY BUT VINCENT KNEW WHEREIN LAY THE STRENGTH OF THE MISSION PRIESTS
7981-112058-0026 HOW CAN WE LEAD SOULS TO GOD HOW CAN WE STEM THE TIDE OF WICKEDNESS AMONG THE PEOPLE LET US REALIZE THAT THIS IS NOT MAN'S WORK AT ALL IT IS GOD'S HUMAN ENERGY WILL ONLY HINDER IT UNLESS DIRECTED BY GOD
7981-112058-0027 THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT OF ALL IS THAT WE SHOULD BE IN TOUCH WITH OUR LORD IN PRAYER DEAREST TO HIS HEART OF ALL HIS UNDERTAKINGS WAS THE FIRST AND CHIEF WORK OF THE CONGREGATION THE HOLDING OF MISSIONS FOR THE POOR
7981-112058-0028 BY TWOS AND THREES HE WOULD SEND OUT HIS SONS TO THEIR LABORS BIDDING THEM TRAVEL TO THEIR DESTINATION IN THE CHEAPEST POSSIBLE WAY THEY WERE TO ACCEPT NEITHER FREE QUARTERS NOR GIFTS OF ANY KIND ALL THEIR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS WERE TO BE CONCENTRATED ON THEIR WORK
7981-112058-0029 THEY WERE TO LIVE FOR THEIR MISSION TWO SERMONS WERE TO BE PREACHED DAILY SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE GREAT TRUTHS AND THOSE WHO HAD NOT YET MADE THEIR FIRST COMMUNION WERE TO BE CATECHIZED THE MISSION LASTED TEN OR FOURTEEN DAYS
7981-112058-0030 DURING WHICH THE MISSION PRIESTS WERE TO HAVE AS MUCH PERSONAL CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE VISITING THE SICK AND THE INFIRM RECONCILING ENEMIES AND SHOWING THEMSELVES AS THE FRIENDS OF ALL
7981-112058-0031 UNLESS THE CONGREGATION OF THE MISSION IS HUMBLE SAID VINCENT AND REALIZES THAT IT CAN ACCOMPLISH NOTHING OF ANY VALUE BUT THAT IT IS MORE APT TO MAR THAN TO MAKE IT WILL NEVER BE OF MUCH EFFECT
7981-112058-0032 BUT WHEN IT HAS THIS SPIRIT IT WILL BE FIT FOR THE PURPOSES OF GOD YET IN SPITE OF ALL THAT SUCH A VOCATION MEANT OF SELF RENUNCIATION YEAR AFTER YEAR THE MISSION PRIESTS INCREASED IN NUMBER
