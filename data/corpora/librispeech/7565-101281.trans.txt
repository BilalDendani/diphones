7565-101281-0000 THE HEADLESS DWARFS THERE WAS ONCE A MINISTER WHO SPENT HIS WHOLE TIME IN TRYING TO FIND A SERVANT WHO WOULD UNDERTAKE TO RING THE CHURCH BELLS AT MIDNIGHT IN ADDITION TO ALL HIS OTHER DUTIES
7565-101281-0001 OF COURSE IT WAS NOT EVERYONE WHO CARED TO GET UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN HE HAD BEEN WORKING HARD ALL DAY STILL A GOOD MANY HAD AGREED TO DO IT BUT THE STRANGE THING WAS THAT NO SOONER HAD THE SERVANT SET FORTH TO PERFORM HIS TASK THAN HE DISAPPEARED
7565-101281-0002 AS IF THE EARTH HAD SWALLOWED HIM UP NO BELLS WERE RUNG AND NO RINGER EVER CAME BACK THE MINISTER DID HIS BEST TO KEEP THE MATTER SECRET BUT IT LEAKED OUT FOR ALL THAT AND THE END OF IT WAS THAT NO ONE WOULD ENTER HIS SERVICE
7565-101281-0003 INDEED THERE WERE EVEN THOSE WHO WHISPERED THAT THE MINISTER HIMSELF HAD MURDERED THE MISSING MEN IT WAS TO NO PURPOSE THAT SUNDAY AFTER SUNDAY THE MINISTER GAVE OUT FROM HIS PULPIT THAT DOUBLE WAGES WOULD BE PAID TO ANYONE THAT WOULD FULFIL THE SACRED DUTY OF RINGING THE BELLS OF THE CHURCH
7565-101281-0004 NO ONE TOOK THE SLIGHTEST NOTICE OF ANY OFFER HE MIGHT MAKE AND THE POOR MAN WAS IN DESPAIR WHEN ONE DAY AS HE WAS STANDING AT HIS HOUSE DOOR A YOUTH KNOWN IN THE VILLAGE AS CLEVER HANS CAME UP TO HIM
7565-101281-0005 I AM TIRED OF LIVING WITH A MISER WHO WILL NOT GIVE ME ENOUGH TO EAT AND DRINK SAID HE AND I AM READY TO DO ALL YOU WANT VERY GOOD MY SON REPLIED THE MINISTER YOU SHALL HAVE THE CHANCE OF PROVING YOUR COURAGE THIS VERY NIGHT TO MORROW
7565-101281-0006 WE WILL SETTLE WHAT YOUR WAGES ARE TO BE HANS WAS QUITE CONTENT WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND WENT STRAIGHT INTO THE KITCHEN TO BEGIN HIS WORK NOT KNOWING THAT HIS NEW MASTER WAS QUITE AS STINGY AS HIS OLD ONE
7565-101281-0007 IN THE HOPE THAT HIS PRESENCE MIGHT BE A RESTRAINT UPON THEM THE MINISTER USED TO SIT AT THE TABLE DURING HIS SERVANTS MEALS AND WOULD EXHORT THEM TO DRINK MUCH AND OFTEN THINKING THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO EAT AS WELL
7565-101281-0008 AND BEEF WAS DEARER THAN BEER BUT IN HANS HE HAD MET HIS MATCH AND THE MINISTER SOON FOUND TO HIS COST THAT IN HIS CASE AT ANY RATE A FULL CUP DID NOT MEAN AN EMPTY PLATE ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE MIDNIGHT
7565-101281-0009 HANS ENTERED THE CHURCH AND LOCKED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM BUT WHAT WAS HIS SURPRISE WHEN IN PLACE OF THE DARKNESS AND SILENCE HE EXPECTED HE FOUND THE CHURCH BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED AND A CROWD OF PEOPLE SITTING ROUND A TABLE PLAYING CARDS
7565-101281-0010 IF ANYBODY HAS A RIGHT TO PUT THAT QUESTION IT IS I AND IF I DO NOT PUT IT IT WILL CERTAINLY BE WISER FOR YOU NOT TO DO SO THEN HE PICKED UP SOME CARDS AND PLAYED WITH THE UNKNOWN MEN AS IF HE HAD KNOWN THEM ALL HIS LIFE
7565-101281-0011 THE LUCK WAS ON HIS SIDE AND SOON THE MONEY OF THE OTHER GAMBLERS FOUND ITS WAY FROM THEIR POCKETS INTO HIS ON THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT THE COCK CREW AND IN AN INSTANT LIGHTS TABLE CARDS AND PEOPLE ALL HAD VANISHED
7565-101281-0012 AND HANS WAS LEFT ALONE HE GROPED ABOUT FOR SOME TIME TILL HE FOUND THE STAIRCASE IN THE TOWER AND THEN BEGAN TO FEEL HIS WAY UP THE STEPS ON THE FIRST LANDING
7565-101281-0013 A GLIMMER OF LIGHT CAME THROUGH A SLIT IN THE WALL AND HE SAW A TINY MAN SITTING THERE WITHOUT A HEAD HO HO MY LITTLE FELLOW
7565-101281-0014 AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER GAVE HIM A KICK WHICH SENT HIM FLYING DOWN THE STAIRS THEN HE CLIMBED HIGHER STILL AND FINDING AS HE WENT DUMB WATCHERS SITTING ON EVERY LANDING TREATED THEM AS HE HAD DONE THE FIRST
7565-101281-0015 AT LAST HE REACHED THE TOP AND AS HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO LOOK ROUND HIM HE SAW ANOTHER HEADLESS MAN COWERING IN THE VERY BELL ITSELF WAITING TILL HANS SHOULD SEIZE THE BELL PULL
7565-101281-0016 IN ORDER TO STRIKE HIM A BLOW WITH THE CLAPPER WHICH WOULD SOON HAVE MADE AN END OF HIM STOP MY LITTLE FRIEND CRIED HANS THAT IS NOT PART OF THE BARGAIN PERHAPS YOU SAW HOW YOUR COMRADES WALKED DOWN STAIRS AND YOU ARE GOING AFTER THEM
7565-101281-0017 BUT AS YOU ARE IN THE HIGHEST PLACE YOU SHALL MAKE A MORE DIGNIFIED EXIT AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH THE WINDOW WITH THESE WORDS HE BEGAN TO CLIMB THE LADDER IN ORDER TO TAKE THE LITTLE MAN FROM THE BELL AND CARRY OUT HIS THREAT AT THIS THE DWARF CRIED OUT IMPLORINGLY
7565-101281-0018 OH BROTHER SPARE MY LIFE AND I PROMISE THAT NEITHER I NOR MY COMRADES WILL EVER TROUBLE YOU ANY MORE I AM SMALL AND WEAK BUT WHO KNOWS WHETHER SOME DAY I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO REWARD YOU YOU WRETCHED LITTLE SHRIMP REPLIED HANS
7565-101281-0019 THE HEADLESS MAN THANKED HIM HUMBLY SLID HASTILY DOWN THE BELL ROPE AND RAN DOWN THE STEPS OF THE TOWER AS IF HE HAD LEFT A FIRE BEHIND HIM THEN HANS BEGAN TO RING LUSTILY WHEN THE MINISTER HEARD THE SOUND OF THE MIDNIGHT BELLS HE WONDERED GREATLY
7565-101281-0020 BUT REJOICED THAT HE HAD AT LAST FOUND SOME ONE TO WHOM HE COULD TRUST THIS DUTY HANS RANG THE BELLS FOR SOME TIME THEN WENT TO THE HAY LOFT AND FELL FAST ASLEEP NOW IT WAS THE CUSTOM OF THE MINISTER TO GET UP VERY EARLY
7565-101281-0021 AND TO GO ROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MEN WERE ALL AT THEIR WORK THIS MORNING EVERYONE WAS IN HIS PLACE EXCEPT HANS AND NO ONE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM NINE O'CLOCK CAME AND NO HANS
7565-101281-0022 BUT WHEN ELEVEN STRUCK THE MINISTER BEGAN TO FEAR THAT HE HAD VANISHED LIKE THE RINGERS WHO HAD GONE BEFORE HIM WHEN HOWEVER THE SERVANTS ALL GATHERED ROUND THE TABLE FOR DINNER HANS AT LAST MADE HIS APPEARANCE STRETCHING HIMSELF AND YAWNING
7565-101281-0023 IF ONE WORKS IN THE NIGHT ONE MUST SLEEP IN THE DAY JUST AS IF ONE WORKS IN THE DAY ONE SLEEPS IN THE NIGHT IF YOU CAN FIND SOMEBODY ELSE TO RING THE BELLS AT MIDNIGHT I AM READY TO BEGIN WORK AT DAWN
7565-101281-0024 BUT IF YOU WANT ME TO RING THEM I MUST GO ON SLEEPING TILL NOON AT THE VERY EARLIEST THE MINISTER TRIED TO ARGUE THE POINT WITH HIM BUT AT LENGTH THE FOLLOWING AGREEMENT WAS COME TO HANS WAS TO GIVE UP THE RINGING
7565-101281-0025 AND WAS TO WORK LIKE THE REST FROM SUNRISE TO SUNSET WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AN HOUR AFTER BREAKFAST AND AN HOUR AFTER DINNER WHEN HE MIGHT GO TO SLEEP BUT OF COURSE ADDED THE MINISTER CARELESSLY IT MAY HAPPEN NOW AND THEN ESPECIALLY IN WINTER
7565-101281-0026 WHEN THE DAYS ARE SHORT THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK A LITTLE LONGER TO GET SOMETHING FINISHED NOT AT ALL ANSWERED HANS
7565-101281-0027 I WILL NOT DO A STROKE MORE THAN I HAVE PROMISED AND THAT IS FROM DAWN TO DARK SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO EXPECT A FEW WEEKS LATER THE MINISTER WAS ASKED TO ATTEND A CHRISTENING IN THE NEIGHBOURING TOWN HE BADE HANS COME WITH HIM
7565-101281-0028 BUT AS THE TOWN WAS ONLY A FEW HOURS RIDE FROM WHERE HE LIVED THE MINISTER WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO SEE HANS COME FORTH LADEN WITH A BAG CONTAINING FOOD
7565-101281-0029 WE SHALL BE THERE BEFORE DARK WHO KNOWS REPLIED HANS MANY THINGS MAY HAPPEN TO DELAY OUR JOURNEY AND I NEED NOT REMIND YOU OF OUR CONTRACT THAT THE MOMENT THE SUN SETS I CEASE TO BE YOUR SERVANT
7565-101281-0030 IF WE DON'T REACH THE TOWN WHILE IT IS STILL DAYLIGHT I SHALL LEAVE YOU TO SHIFT FOR YOURSELF THE MINISTER THOUGHT HE WAS JOKING AND MADE NO FURTHER REMARK BUT WHEN THEY HAD LEFT THE VILLAGE BEHIND THEM AND HAD RIDDEN A FEW MILES
7565-101281-0031 THEY FOUND THAT SNOW HAD FALLEN DURING THE NIGHT AND HAD BEEN BLOWN BY THE WIND INTO DRIFTS THIS HINDERED THEIR PROGRESS AND BY THE TIME THEY HAD ENTERED THE THICK WOOD WHICH LAY BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR DESTINATION THE SUN WAS ALREADY TOUCHING THE TOPS OF THE TREES
7565-101281-0032 THE HORSES PLOUGHED THEIR WAY SLOWLY THROUGH THE DEEP SOFT SNOW AND AS THEY WENT HANS KEPT TURNING TO LOOK AT THE SUN WHICH LAY AT THEIR BACKS IS THERE ANYTHING BEHIND YOU ASKED THE MINISTER OR WHAT IS IT YOU ARE ALWAYS TURNING ROUND FOR
7565-101281-0033 I TURN ROUND BECAUSE I HAVE NO EYES IN THE BACK OF MY NECK SAID HANS CEASE TALKING NONSENSE REPLIED THE MINISTER AND GIVE ALL YOUR MIND TO GETTING US TO THE TOWN BEFORE NIGHTFALL HANS DID NOT ANSWER BUT RODE ON STEADILY
7565-101281-0034 THOUGH EVERY NOW AND THEN HE CAST A GLANCE OVER HIS SHOULDER WHEN THEY ARRIVED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WOOD THE SUN SANK ALTOGETHER THEN HANS REINED UP HIS HORSE TOOK HIS KNAPSACK AND JUMPED OUT OF THE SLEDGE WHAT ARE YOU DOING ARE YOU MAD
7565-101281-0035 ASKED THE MINISTER BUT HANS ANSWERED QUIETLY THE SUN IS SET AND MY WORK IS OVER AND I AM GOING TO CAMP HERE FOR THE NIGHT IN VAIN THE MASTER PRAYED AND THREATENED AND PROMISED HANS A LARGE REWARD IF HE WOULD ONLY DRIVE HIM ON
7565-101281-0036 THE YOUNG MAN WAS NOT TO BE MOVED ARE YOU NOT ASHAMED TO URGE ME TO BREAK MY WORD SAID HE IF YOU WANT TO REACH THE TOWN TO NIGHT YOU MUST GO ALONE THE HOUR OF MY FREEDOM HAS STRUCK AND I CANNOT GO WITH YOU
7565-101281-0037 YONDER AS YOU SEE A GALLOWS IS SET UP AND TWO EVIL DOERS ARE HANGING ON IT YOU COULD NOT POSSIBLY SLEEP WITH SUCH GHASTLY NEIGHBOURS WHY NOT ASKED HANS THOSE GALLOWS BIRDS HANG HIGH IN THE AIR
7565-101281-0038 AND MY CAMP WILL BE ON THE GROUND WE SHALL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH EACH OTHER AS HE SPOKE HE TURNED HIS BACK ON THE MINISTER AND WENT HIS WAY THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT AND THE MINISTER HAD TO PUSH ON BY HIMSELF
7565-101281-0039 HIS FRIENDS WERE MUCH SURPRISED TO SEE HIM DRIVE UP WITHOUT A COACHMAN AND THOUGHT SOME ACCIDENT HAD HAPPENED BUT WHEN HE TOLD THEM OF HIS CONVERSATION WITH HANS THEY DID NOT KNOW WHICH WAS THE MOST FOOLISH MASTER OR MAN
7565-101281-0040 IT WOULD HAVE MATTERED LITTLE TO HANS HAD HE KNOWN WHAT THEY WERE SAYING OR THINKING OF HIM HE SATISFIED HIS HUNGER WITH THE FOOD HE HAD IN HIS KNAPSACK LIT HIS PIPE PITCHED HIS TENT UNDER THE BOUGHS OF A TREE WRAPPED HIMSELF IN HIS FURS AND WENT SOUND ASLEEP
7565-101281-0041 AFTER SOME HOURS HE WAS AWAKENED BY A SUDDEN NOISE AND SAT UP AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM THE MOON WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY ABOVE HIS HEAD AND CLOSE BY STOOD TWO HEADLESS DWARFS TALKING ANGRILY
7565-101281-0042 AT THE SIGHT OF HANS THE LITTLE DWARFS CRIED OUT IT IS HE IT IS HE AND ONE OF THEM STEPPING NEARER EXCLAIMED AH MY OLD FRIEND IT IS A LUCKY CHANCE THAT HAS BROUGHT US HERE
7565-101281-0043 MY BONES STILL ACHE FROM MY FALL DOWN THE STEPS OF THE TOWER I DARE SAY YOU HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THAT NIGHT NOW IT IS THE TURN OF YOUR BONES HI COMRADES MAKE HASTE MAKE HASTE
7565-101281-0044 LIKE A SWARM OF MIDGES A HOST OF TINY HEADLESS CREATURES SEEMED TO SPRING STRAIGHT OUT OF THE GROUND AND EVERY ONE WAS ARMED WITH A CLUB ALTHOUGH THEY WERE SO SMALL YET THERE WERE SUCH NUMBERS OF THEM AND THEY STRUCK SO HARD
7565-101281-0045 THAT EVEN A STRONG MAN COULD DO NOTHING AGAINST THEM HANS THOUGHT HIS LAST HOUR WAS COME WHEN JUST AS THE FIGHT WAS AT THE HOTTEST ANOTHER LITTLE DWARF ARRIVED ON THE SCENE HOLD COMRADES HE SHOUTED TURNING TO THE ATTACKING PARTY
7565-101281-0046 THIS MAN ONCE DID ME A SERVICE AND I AM HIS DEBTOR WHEN I WAS IN HIS POWER HE GRANTED ME MY LIFE AND EVEN IF HE DID THROW YOU DOWNSTAIRS WELL A WARM BATH SOON CURED YOUR BRUISES
7565-101281-0047 SO YOU MUST JUST FORGIVE HIM AND GO QUIETLY HOME THE HEADLESS DWARFS LISTENED TO HIS WORDS AND DISAPPEARED AS SUDDENLY AS THEY HAD COME AS SOON AS HANS RECOVERED HIMSELF A LITTLE HE LOOKED AT HIS RESCUER
7565-101281-0048 AND SAW HE WAS THE DWARF HE HAD FOUND SEATED IN THE CHURCH BELL AH SAID THE DWARF SEATING HIMSELF QUIETLY UNDER THE TREE YOU LAUGHED AT ME WHEN I TOLD YOU THAT SOME DAY I MIGHT DO YOU A GOOD TURN NOW YOU SEE I WAS RIGHT
7565-101281-0049 AND PERHAPS YOU WILL LEARN FOR THE FUTURE NOT TO DESPISE ANY CREATURE HOWEVER SMALL I THANK YOU FROM MY HEART ANSWERED HANS MY BONES ARE STILL SORE FROM THEIR BLOWS AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR YOU I SHOULD INDEED HAVE FARED BADLY I HAVE ALMOST PAID MY DEBT WENT ON THE LITTLE MAN
7565-101281-0050 BUT AS YOU HAVE SUFFERED ALREADY I WILL DO MORE AND GIVE YOU A PIECE OF INFORMATION YOU NEED NOT REMAIN ANY LONGER IN THE SERVICE OF THAT STINGY MINISTER BUT WHEN YOU GET HOME TO MORROW GO AT ONCE TO THE NORTH CORNER OF THE CHURCH
7565-101281-0051 AND THERE YOU WILL FIND A LARGE STONE BUILT INTO THE WALL BUT NOT CEMENTED LIKE THE REST THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW THE MOON IS FULL AND AT MIDNIGHT YOU MUST GO TO THE SPOT AND GET THE STONE OUT OF THE WALL WITH A PICKAXE UNDER THE STONE LIES A GREAT TREASURE
7565-101281-0052 WHICH HAS BEEN HIDDEN THERE IN TIME OF WAR BESIDES CHURCH PLATE YOU WILL FIND BAGS OF MONEY WHICH HAVE BEEN LYING IN THIS PLACE FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AND NO ONE KNOWS TO WHOM IT ALL BELONGS A THIRD OF THIS MONEY YOU MUST GIVE TO THE POOR
7565-101281-0053 THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE HEAVENS WHEN HIS MASTER RETURNED FROM THE TOWN HANS SAID HE WHAT A FOOL YOU WERE NOT TO COME WITH ME YESTERDAY I WAS WELL FEASTED AND ENTERTAINED
7565-101281-0054 AND I HAVE MONEY IN MY POCKET INTO THE BARGAIN HE WENT ON RATTLING SOME COINS WHILE HE SPOKE TO MAKE HANS UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH HE HAD LOST AH SIR REPLIED HANS CALMLY IN ORDER TO HAVE GAINED SO MUCH MONEY
7565-101281-0055 WISE MEN TAKE CARE TO HIDE THEIR CROWNS THEY DROVE HOME AND HANS NEGLECTED NONE OF HIS DUTIES BUT PUT UP THE HORSES AND GAVE THEM THEIR FOOD BEFORE GOING TO THE CHURCH CORNER WHERE HE FOUND THE LOOSE STONE
7565-101281-0056 EXACTLY IN THE PLACE DESCRIBED BY THE DWARF THEN HE RETURNED TO HIS WORK THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE FULL MOON WHEN THE WHOLE VILLAGE WAS ASLEEP HE STOLE OUT ARMED WITH A PICKAXE AND WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY
7565-101281-0057 SUCCEEDED IN DISLODGING THE STONE FROM ITS PLACE SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS THE HOLE AND IN THE HOLE LAY THE TREASURE EXACTLY AS THE LITTLE MAN HAD SAID THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY HE HANDED OVER THE THIRD PART TO THE VILLAGE POOR
7565-101281-0058 AND INFORMED THE MINISTER THAT HE WISHED TO BREAK HIS BOND OF SERVICE AS HOWEVER HE DID NOT CLAIM ANY WAGES THE MINISTER MADE NO OBJECTIONS BUT ALLOWED HIM TO DO AS HE WISHED SO HANS WENT HIS WAY BOUGHT HIMSELF A LARGE HOUSE AND MARRIED A YOUNG WIFE
