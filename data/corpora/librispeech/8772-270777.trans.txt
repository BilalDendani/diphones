8772-270777-0000 DREAMS OF CHILDHOOD WE THINK WE HAVE ADVANCED TOO RAPIDLY LET US GO BACK A LITTLE BEFORE OUR LAST ATTEMPT TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES OF DREAM DISTORTION THROUGH OUR TECHNIQUE
8772-270777-0001 IN WHICH DISTORTION IS EITHER ENTIRELY ABSENT OR OF TRIFLING IMPORTANCE IF THERE ARE SUCH BUT HERE AGAIN WE DIGRESS FROM THE HISTORY OF THE EVOLUTION OF OUR KNOWLEDGE FOR AS A MATTER OF FACT
8772-270777-0002 WE BECOME AWARE OF DREAMS ENTIRELY FREE OF DISTORTION ONLY AFTER THE CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF OUR METHOD OF INTERPRETATION AND AFTER COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF THE DISTORTED DREAM
8772-270777-0003 THEY ARE SHORT CLEAR COHERENT EASY TO UNDERSTAND UNAMBIGUOUS AND YET UNQUESTIONABLE DREAMS BUT DO NOT THINK THAT ALL CHILDREN'S DREAMS ARE LIKE THIS
8772-270777-0004 DREAM DISTORTION MAKES ITS APPEARANCE VERY EARLY IN CHILDHOOD AND DREAMS OF CHILDREN FROM FIVE TO EIGHT YEARS OF AGE HAVE BEEN RECORDED THAT SHOWED ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS OF LATER DREAMS
8772-270777-0005 BUT IF YOU WILL LIMIT YOURSELVES TO THE AGE BEGINNING WITH CONSCIOUS PSYCHIC ACTIVITY UP TO THE FOURTH OR FIFTH YEAR YOU WILL DISCOVER A SERIES OF DREAMS THAT ARE OF A SO CALLED INFANTILE CHARACTER
8772-270777-0006 FROM THESE CHILDREN'S DREAMS WE GAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING THE NATURE OF DREAMS WITH GREAT EASE AND CERTAINTY AND WE HOPE IT WILL PROVE DECISIVE AND OF UNIVERSAL APPLICATION ONE
8772-270777-0007 FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF THESE DREAMS WE NEED NO ANALYSIS NO TECHNICAL METHODS WE NEED NOT QUESTION THE CHILD THAT IS GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF HIS DREAM BUT ONE MUST ADD TO THIS A STORY TAKEN FROM THE LIFE OF THE CHILD
8772-270777-0008 SO THAT WE MAY BASE OUR FURTHER DEDUCTIONS UPON THEM A A BOY OF TWENTY TWO MONTHS IS TO PRESENT A BASKET OF CHERRIES AS A BIRTHDAY GIFT HE PLAINLY DOES SO VERY UNWILLINGLY
8772-270777-0009 ALTHOUGH THEY PROMISE HIM THAT HE WILL GET SOME OF THEM HIMSELF THE NEXT MORNING HE RELATES AS HIS DREAM HERMANN EAT ALL CHERRIES B
8772-270777-0010 A LITTLE GIRL OF THREE AND A QUARTER YEARS MAKES HER FIRST TRIP ACROSS A LAKE AT THE LANDING SHE DOES NOT WANT TO LEAVE THE BOAT AND CRIES BITTERLY THE TIME OF THE TRIP SEEMS TO HER TO HAVE PASSED ENTIRELY TOO RAPIDLY
8772-270777-0011 THE NEXT MORNING SHE SAYS LAST NIGHT I RODE ON THE LAKE WE MAY ADD THE SUPPLEMENTARY FACT THAT THIS TRIP LASTED LONGER
8772-270777-0012 A BOY OF FIVE AND A QUARTER YEARS IS TAKEN ON AN EXCURSION INTO THE ESCHERNTAL NEAR HALLSTATT HE HAD HEARD THAT HALLSTATT LAY AT THE FOOT OF THE DACHSTEIN AND HAD SHOWN GREAT INTEREST IN THIS MOUNTAIN
8772-270777-0013 FROM HIS HOME IN AUSSEE THERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL VIEW OF THE DACHSTEIN
8772-270777-0014 THE CHILD HAD TRIED AGAIN AND AGAIN TO SEE IT THROUGH THE TELESCOPE WITH WHAT RESULT NO ONE KNEW HE STARTED ON THE EXCURSION IN A JOYOUSLY EXPECTANT MOOD WHENEVER A NEW MOUNTAIN CAME IN SIGHT THE BOY ASKED
8772-270777-0015 IS THAT THE DACHSTEIN THE OFTENER THIS QUESTION WAS ANSWERED IN THE NEGATIVE THE MORE MOODY HE BECAME LATER HE BECAME ENTIRELY SILENT AND WOULD NOT TAKE PART IN A SMALL CLIMB TO A WATERFALL
8772-270777-0016 THEY THOUGHT HE WAS OVERTIRED BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE SAID QUITE HAPPILY LAST NIGHT I DREAMED THAT WE WERE IN THE SIMONYHUETTE IT WAS WITH THIS EXPECTATION THEREFORE THAT HE HAD TAKEN PART IN THE EXCURSION
8772-270777-0017 THE ONLY DETAIL HE GAVE WAS ONE HE HAD HEARD BEFORE YOU HAD TO CLIMB STEPS FOR SIX HOURS THESE THREE DREAMS WILL SUFFICE FOR ALL THE INFORMATION WE DESIRE
8772-270777-0018 TWO WE SEE THAT CHILDREN'S DREAMS ARE NOT MEANINGLESS THEY ARE INTELLIGIBLE SIGNIFICANT PSYCHIC ACTS YOU WILL RECALL WHAT I REPRESENTED TO YOU AS THE MEDICAL OPINION CONCERNING THE DREAM
8772-270777-0019 THE SIMILE OF UNTRAINED FINGERS WANDERING AIMLESSLY OVER THE KEYS OF THE PIANO YOU CANNOT FAIL TO SEE HOW DECIDEDLY THESE DREAMS OF CHILDHOOD ARE OPPOSED TO THIS CONCEPTION
8772-270777-0020 BUT IT WOULD BE STRANGE INDEED IF THE CHILD BROUGHT FORTH COMPLETE PSYCHIC PRODUCTS IN SLEEP WHILE THE ADULT IN THE SAME CONDITION CONTENTS HIMSELF WITH SPASMODIC REACTIONS INDEED
8772-270777-0021 WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO ATTRIBUTE THE MORE NORMAL AND DEEPER SLEEP TO THE CHILD THREE DREAM DISTORTION IS LACKING IN THESE DREAMS THEREFORE THEY NEED NO INTERPRETATION THE MANIFEST AND LATENT DREAMS ARE MERGED
8772-270777-0022 DREAM DISTORTION IS THEREFORE NOT INHERENT IN THE DREAM I MAY ASSUME THAT THIS RELIEVES YOU OF A GREAT BURDEN BUT UPON CLOSER CONSIDERATION WE SHALL HAVE TO ADMIT OF A TINY BIT OF DISTORTION
8772-270777-0023 A CERTAIN DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN MANIFEST DREAM CONTENT AND LATENT DREAM THOUGHT EVEN IN THESE DREAMS FOUR THE CHILD'S DREAM IS A REACTION TO AN EXPERIENCE OF THE DAY
8772-270777-0024 NOW RECALL OUR DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ROLE OF EXTERNAL OR INTERNAL BODILY STIMULI AS DISTURBERS OF SLEEP OR AS DREAM PRODUCERS WE LEARNED DEFINITE FACTS ABOUT THIS
8772-270777-0025 BUT COULD ONLY EXPLAIN A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF DREAMS IN THIS WAY IN THESE CHILDREN'S DREAMS NOTHING POINTS TO THE INFLUENCE OF SUCH SOMATIC STIMULI WE CANNOT BE MISTAKEN FOR THE DREAMS ARE ENTIRELY INTELLIGIBLE AND EASY TO SURVEY
8772-270777-0026 BUT WE NEED NOT GIVE UP THE THEORY OF PHYSICAL CAUSATION ENTIRELY ON THIS ACCOUNT WE CAN ONLY ASK WHY AT THE OUTSET WE FORGOT THAT BESIDES THE PHYSICAL STIMULI THERE ARE ALSO PSYCHIC SLEEP DISTURBING STIMULI
8772-270777-0027 FOR WE KNOW THAT IT IS THESE STIMULI THAT COMMONLY CAUSE THE DISTURBED SLEEP OF ADULTS BY PREVENTING THEM FROM PRODUCING THE IDEAL CONDITION OF SLEEP THE WITHDRAWAL OF INTEREST FROM THE WORLD THE DREAMER DOES NOT WISH TO INTERRUPT HIS LIFE
8772-270777-0028 BUT WOULD RATHER CONTINUE HIS WORK WITH THE THINGS THAT OCCUPY HIM AND FOR THIS REASON HE DOES NOT SLEEP THE UNFULFILLED WISH TO WHICH HE REACTS BY MEANS OF THE DREAM IS THE PSYCHIC SLEEP DISTURBING STIMULUS FOR THE CHILD
8772-270777-0029 FIVE FROM THIS POINT WE EASILY ARRIVE AT AN EXPLANATION OF THE FUNCTION OF THE DREAM THE DREAM AS A REACTION TO THE PSYCHIC STIMULUS MUST HAVE THE VALUE OF A RELEASE OF THIS STIMULUS
8772-270777-0030 WHICH RESULTS IN ITS ELIMINATION AND IN THE CONTINUATION OF SLEEP WE DO NOT KNOW HOW THIS RELEASE IS MADE POSSIBLE BY THE DREAM BUT WE NOTE THAT THE DREAM IS NOT A DISTURBER OF SLEEP AS CALUMNY SAYS
8772-270777-0031 BUT A GUARDIAN OF SLEEP WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO QUELL DISTURBANCES IT IS TRUE WE THINK WE WOULD HAVE SLEPT BETTER IF WE HAD NOT DREAMT BUT HERE WE ARE WRONG AS A MATTER OF FACT WE WOULD NOT HAVE SLEPT AT ALL WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE DREAM
8772-270777-0032 THAT WE HAVE SLEPT SO SOUNDLY IS DUE TO THE DREAM ALONE IT COULD NOT HELP DISTURBING US SLIGHTLY JUST AS THE NIGHT WATCHMAN OFTEN CANNOT AVOID MAKING A LITTLE NOISE WHILE HE DRIVES AWAY THE RIOTERS WHO WOULD AWAKEN US WITH THEIR NOISE
8772-270777-0033 SIX ONE MAIN CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DREAM IS THAT A WISH IS ITS SOURCE AND THAT THE CONTENT OF THE DREAM IS THE GRATIFICATION OF THIS WISH
8772-270777-0034 ANOTHER EQUALLY CONSTANT FEATURE IS THAT THE DREAM DOES NOT MERELY EXPRESS A THOUGHT BUT ALSO REPRESENTS THE FULFILLMENT OF THIS WISH IN THE FORM OF A HALLUCINATORY EXPERIENCE I SHOULD LIKE TO TRAVEL ON THE LAKE
8772-270777-0035 SAYS THE WISH THAT EXCITES THE DREAM THE DREAM ITSELF HAS AS ITS CONTENT I TRAVEL ON THE LAKE ONE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE LATENT AND MANIFEST DREAM A DISTORTION OF THE LATENT DREAM THOUGHT
8772-270777-0036 THEREFORE REMAINS EVEN IN THE CASE OF THESE SIMPLE CHILDREN'S DREAMS NAMELY THE TRANSLATION OF THE THOUGHT INTO EXPERIENCE IN THE INTERPRETATION OF THE DREAM IT IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT THIS CHANGE BE TRACED BACK
8772-270777-0037 IF THIS SHOULD PROVE TO BE AN EXTREMELY COMMON CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DREAM THEN THE ABOVE MENTIONED DREAM FRAGMENT I SEE MY BROTHER IN A CLOSET COULD NOT BE TRANSLATED MY BROTHER IS CLOSE PRESSED BUT RATHER
8772-270777-0038 I WISH THAT MY BROTHER WERE CLOSE PRESSED MY BROTHER SHOULD BE CLOSE PRESSED OF THE TWO UNIVERSAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DREAM WE HAVE CITED THE SECOND PLAINLY HAS GREATER PROSPECTS OF UNCONDITIONAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAN THE FIRST
8772-270777-0039 ONLY EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATION CAN ASCERTAIN THAT THE CAUSE OF THE DREAM MUST ALWAYS BE A WISH AND CANNOT ALSO BE AN ANXIETY A PLAN OR A REPROACH BUT THIS DOES NOT ALTER THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC
8772-270777-0040 THAT THE DREAM DOES NOT SIMPLY REPRODUCE THE STIMULUS BUT BY EXPERIENCING IT ANEW AS IT WERE REMOVES EXPELLS AND SETTLES IT SEVEN
8772-270777-0041 IN CONNECTION WITH THESE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DREAM WE CAN AGAIN RESUME THE COMPARISON BETWEEN THE DREAM AND THE ERROR IN THE CASE OF THE LATTER WE DISTINGUISH AN INTERFERING TENDENCY AND ONE INTERFERED WITH
8772-270777-0042 AND THE ERROR IS THE COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO THE DREAM FITS INTO THE SAME SCHEME THE TENDENCY INTERFERED WITH IN THIS CASE CAN BE NO OTHER THAN THAT OF SLEEP
8772-270777-0043 FOR THE INTERFERING TENDENCY WE SUBSTITUTE THE PSYCHIC STIMULUS THE WISH WHICH STRIVES FOR ITS FULFILLMENT LET US SAY FOR THUS FAR WE ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY OTHER SLEEP DISTURBING PSYCHIC STIMULUS
8772-270777-0044 IN THIS INSTANCE ALSO THE DREAM IS THE RESULT OF COMPROMISE WE SLEEP AND YET WE EXPERIENCE THE REMOVAL OF A WISH WE GRATIFY THE WISH BUT AT THE SAME TIME CONTINUE TO SLEEP
