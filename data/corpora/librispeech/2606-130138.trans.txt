2606-130138-0000 TURNED THE POINT OF SANDY HOOK AND PUT TO SEA DURING THE DAY SHE SKIRTED LONG ISLAND PASSED FIRE ISLAND AND DIRECTED HER COURSE RAPIDLY EASTWARD
2606-130138-0001 IT MIGHT BE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS CAPTAIN SPEEDY NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD IT WAS PHILEAS FOGG ESQUIRE AS FOR CAPTAIN SPEEDY HE WAS SHUT UP IN HIS CABIN UNDER LOCK AND KEY AND WAS UTTERING LOUD CRIES WHICH SIGNIFIED AN ANGER AT ONCE PARDONABLE AND EXCESSIVE WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS VERY SIMPLE
2606-130138-0002 PHILEAS FOGG WISHED TO GO TO LIVERPOOL BUT THE CAPTAIN WOULD NOT CARRY HIM THERE
2606-130138-0003 AND WERE NOT ON THE BEST TERMS WITH THE CAPTAIN WENT OVER TO HIM IN A BODY
2606-130138-0004 WHY THE CAPTAIN WAS A PRISONER IN HIS CABIN AND WHY IN SHORT THE HENRIETTA WAS DIRECTING HER COURSE TOWARDS LIVERPOOL IT WAS VERY CLEAR TO SEE MISTER FOGG MANAGE THE CRAFT THAT HE HAD BEEN A SAILOR HOW THE ADVENTURE ENDED WILL BE SEEN ANON
2606-130138-0005 AS FOR PASSEPARTOUT HE THOUGHT MISTER FOGG'S MANOEUVRE SIMPLY GLORIOUS THE CAPTAIN HAD SAID BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE KNOTS AND THE HENRIETTA CONFIRMED HIS PREDICTION IF THEN FOR THERE WERE IFS STILL THE SEA DID NOT BECOME TOO BOISTEROUS IF THE WIND DID NOT VEER ROUND TO THE EAST IF NO ACCIDENT HAPPENED TO THE BOAT OR ITS MACHINERY
2606-130138-0006 THE HENRIETTA MIGHT CROSS THE THREE THOUSAND MILES FROM NEW YORK TO LIVERPOOL IN THE NINE DAYS BETWEEN THE TWELFTH AND THE TWENTY FIRST OF DECEMBER IT IS TRUE THAT ONCE ARRIVED THE AFFAIR ON BOARD THE HENRIETTA ADDED TO THAT OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND MIGHT CREATE MORE DIFFICULTIES FOR MISTER FOGG
2606-130138-0007 OR COULD DESIRE DURING THE FIRST DAYS THEY WENT ALONG SMOOTHLY ENOUGH
2606-130138-0008 HIS MASTER'S LAST EXPLOIT THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH HE IGNORED ENCHANTED HIM NEVER HAD THE CREW SEEN SO JOLLY AND DEXTEROUS A FELLOW HE FORMED WARM FRIENDSHIPS WITH THE SAILORS AND AMAZED THEM WITH HIS ACROBATIC FEATS HE THOUGHT THEY MANAGED THE VESSEL LIKE GENTLEMEN
2606-130138-0009 AND THAT THE STOKERS FIRED UP LIKE HEROES HIS LOQUACIOUS GOOD HUMOUR INFECTED EVERYONE HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE PAST ITS VEXATIONS AND DELAYS HE ONLY THOUGHT OF THE END SO NEARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND SOMETIMES HE BOILED OVER WITH IMPATIENCE AS IF HEATED BY THE FURNACES OF THE HENRIETTA
2606-130138-0010 OFTEN ALSO THE WORTHY FELLOW REVOLVED AROUND FIX LOOKING AT HIM WITH A KEEN DISTRUSTFUL EYE BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK TO HIM
2606-130138-0011 WAS NOT GOING TO LIVERPOOL AT ALL BUT TO SOME PART OF THE WORLD WHERE THE ROBBER TURNED INTO A PIRATE WOULD QUIETLY PUT HIMSELF IN SAFETY THE CONJECTURE WAS AT LEAST A PLAUSIBLE ONE AND THE DETECTIVE BEGAN TO SERIOUSLY REGRET THAT HE HAD EMBARKED ON THE AFFAIR
2606-130138-0012 AS FOR CAPTAIN SPEEDY HE CONTINUED TO HOWL AND GROWL IN HIS CABIN
2606-130138-0013 COURAGEOUS AS HE WAS TOOK THE GREATEST PRECAUTIONS MISTER FOGG DID NOT SEEM EVEN TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS A CAPTAIN ON BOARD ON THE THIRTEENTH THEY PASSED THE EDGE OF THE BANKS OF NEWFOUNDLAND A DANGEROUS LOCALITY DURING THE WINTER ESPECIALLY THERE ARE FREQUENT FOGS AND HEAVY GALES OF WIND
2606-130138-0014 EVER SINCE THE EVENING BEFORE THE BAROMETER SUDDENLY FALLING HAD INDICATED AN APPROACHING CHANGE IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND DURING THE NIGHT THE TEMPERATURE VARIED THE COLD BECAME SHARPER AND THE WIND VEERED TO THE SOUTH EAST THIS WAS A MISFORTUNE MISTER FOGG IN ORDER NOT TO DEVIATE FROM HIS COURSE
2606-130138-0015 FURLED HIS SAILS AND INCREASED THE FORCE OF THE STEAM BUT THE VESSEL'S SPEED SLACKENED OWING TO THE STATE OF THE SEA THE LONG WAVES OF WHICH BROKE AGAINST THE STERN SHE PITCHED VIOLENTLY AND THIS RETARDED HER PROGRESS
2606-130138-0016 AND FOR TWO DAYS THE POOR FELLOW EXPERIENCED CONSTANT FRIGHT
2606-130138-0017 AND KNEW HOW TO MAINTAIN HEADWAY AGAINST THE SEA AND HE KEPT ON HIS COURSE WITHOUT EVEN DECREASING HIS STEAM
2606-130138-0018 SOMETIMES THE SCREW ROSE OUT OF THE WATER BEATING ITS PROTRUDING END WHEN A MOUNTAIN OF WATER RAISED THE STERN ABOVE THE WAVES BUT THE CRAFT ALWAYS KEPT STRAIGHT AHEAD THE WIND HOWEVER DID NOT GROW AS BOISTEROUS AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN FEARED IT WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE TEMPESTS WHICH BURST
2606-130138-0019 AND RUSH ON WITH A SPEED OF NINETY MILES AN HOUR IT CONTINUED FRESH BUT UNHAPPILY IT REMAINED OBSTINATELY IN THE SOUTH EAST RENDERING THE SAILS USELESS THE SIXTEENTH OF DECEMBER WAS THE SEVENTY FIFTH DAY SINCE PHILEAS FOGG'S DEPARTURE FROM LONDON AND THE HENRIETTA HAD NOT YET BEEN SERIOUSLY DELAYED
2606-130138-0020 HALF OF THE VOYAGE WAS ALMOST ACCOMPLISHED AND THE WORST LOCALITIES HAD BEEN PASSED
2606-130138-0021 IN WINTER THEY WERE AT THE MERCY OF THE BAD SEASON PASSEPARTOUT SAID NOTHING BUT HE CHERISHED HOPE IN SECRET AND COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE REFLECTION THAT IF THE WIND FAILED THEM THEY MIGHT STILL COUNT ON THE STEAM ON THIS DAY THE ENGINEER CAME ON DECK WENT UP TO MISTER FOGG AND BEGAN TO SPEAK EARNESTLY WITH HIM
2606-130138-0022 HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN ONE OF HIS EARS TO HEAR WITH THE OTHER WHAT THE ENGINEER WAS SAYING
2606-130138-0023 YOU ARE CERTAIN OF WHAT YOU TELL ME CERTAIN SIR REPLIED THE ENGINEER YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT SINCE WE STARTED WE HAVE KEPT UP HOT FIRES IN ALL OUR FURNACES AND THOUGH WE HAD COAL ENOUGH TO GO ON SHORT STEAM FROM NEW YORK TO BORDEAUX
2606-130138-0024 HE WAS SEIZED WITH MORTAL ANXIETY THE COAL WAS GIVING OUT AH IF MY MASTER CAN GET OVER THAT MUTTERED HE HE'LL BE A FAMOUS MAN HE COULD NOT HELP IMPARTING TO FIX WHAT HE HAD OVERHEARD
2606-130138-0025 OF COURSE ASS REPLIED THE DETECTIVE SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS AND TURNING ON HIS HEEL
2606-130138-0026 THE REASON OF WHICH HE COULD NOT FOR THE LIFE OF HIM COMPREHEND
2606-130138-0027 AFTER HAVING SO AWKWARDLY FOLLOWED A FALSE SCENT AROUND THE WORLD AND REFRAINED AND NOW WHAT COURSE WOULD PHILEAS FOGG ADOPT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE NEVERTHELESS HE SEEMED TO HAVE DECIDED UPON ONE FOR THAT EVENING HE SENT FOR THE ENGINEER AND SAID TO HIM
2606-130138-0028 FEED ALL THE FIRES UNTIL THE COAL IS EXHAUSTED A FEW MOMENTS AFTER THE FUNNEL OF THE HENRIETTA VOMITED FORTH TORRENTS OF SMOKE THE VESSEL CONTINUED TO PROCEED WITH ALL STEAM ON BUT ON THE EIGHTEENTH THE ENGINEER AS HE HAD PREDICTED
2606-130138-0029 REPLIED MISTER FOGG KEEP THEM UP TO THE LAST LET THE VALVES BE FILLED TOWARDS NOON PHILEAS FOGG HAVING ASCERTAINED THEIR POSITION CALLED PASSEPARTOUT AND ORDERED HIM TO GO FOR CAPTAIN SPEEDY
2606-130138-0030 IT WAS AS IF THE HONEST FELLOW HAD BEEN COMMANDED TO UNCHAIN A TIGER HE WENT TO THE POOP SAYING TO HIMSELF HE WILL BE LIKE A MADMAN IN A FEW MOMENTS WITH CRIES AND OATHS A BOMB APPEARED ON THE POOP DECK THE BOMB WAS CAPTAIN SPEEDY
2606-130138-0031 IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE WAS ON THE POINT OF BURSTING WHERE ARE WE WERE THE FIRST WORDS HIS ANGER PERMITTED HIM TO UTTER HAD THE POOR MAN BEEN AN APOPLECTIC HE COULD NEVER HAVE RECOVERED FROM HIS PAROXYSM OF WRATH
2606-130138-0032 SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILES FROM LIVERPOOL REPLIED MISTER FOGG WITH IMPERTURBABLE CALMNESS
2606-130138-0033 CRIED CAPTAIN SPEEDY I HAVE SENT FOR YOU SIR PICKAROON SIR CONTINUED MISTER FOGG TO ASK YOU TO SELL ME YOUR VESSEL NO
2606-130138-0034 BUT I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO BURN HER BURN THE HENRIETTA YES AT LEAST THE UPPER PART OF HER THE COAL HAS GIVEN OUT BURN MY VESSEL CRIED CAPTAIN SPEEDY WHO COULD SCARCELY PRONOUNCE THE WORDS
2606-130138-0035 A VESSEL WORTH FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS HERE ARE SIXTY THOUSAND REPLIED PHILEAS FOGG HANDING THE CAPTAIN A ROLL OF BANK BILLS THIS HAD A PRODIGIOUS EFFECT ON ANDREW SPEEDY AN AMERICAN CAN SCARCELY REMAIN UNMOVED AT THE SIGHT OF SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
2606-130138-0036 THE HENRIETTA WAS TWENTY YEARS OLD IT WAS A GREAT BARGAIN

2606-130138-0040 DON'T LET THIS ASTONISH YOU SIR YOU MUST KNOW THAT I SHALL LOSE TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS UNLESS I ARRIVE IN LONDON BY A QUARTER BEFORE NINE ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTY FIRST OF DECEMBER I MISSED THE STEAMER AT NEW YORK AND AS YOU REFUSED TO TAKE ME TO LIVERPOOL

2606-130138-0042 FOGG CAPTAIN FOGG
2606-130138-0043 AND HAVING PAID HIS PASSENGER WHAT HE CONSIDERED A HIGH COMPLIMENT HE WAS GOING AWAY WHEN MISTER FOGG SAID THE VESSEL NOW BELONGS TO ME
