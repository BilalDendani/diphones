3977-185466-0000 A SMALL HOLE ABOUT AS LARGE AS A THIMBLE MAY BE GOUGED OUT OF A BLOCK AND COVERED OVER WITH WIRE GAUZE OR ANY OTHER KIND OF PERFORATED COVER SO THAT WHEN THE QUEEN IS PUT IN THE BEES CANNOT ENTER TO DESTROY HER
3977-185466-0001 SO THAT WHEN SHE IS LIBERATED THE NEXT DAY THEY WILL GLADLY ADOPT HER IN PLACE OF THE ONE THEY HAVE LOST
3977-185466-0002 THEY WILL GNAW THE WAX AWAY AND LIBERATE HER THEMSELVES FROM HER CONFINEMENT QUEENS THAT SEEM BENT ON DEPARTING TO THE WOODS MAY BE CONFINED IN THE SAME WAY
3977-185466-0003 A SMALL PASTE BOARD BOX WITH SUITABLE HOLES OR A WOODEN MATCH BOX THOROUGHLY SCALDED I HAVE FOUND TO ANSWER A VERY GOOD PURPOSE I SHALL HERE DESCRIBE WHAT MAY BE CALLED A QUEEN NURSERY
3977-185466-0004 WHICH I HAVE CONTRIVED TO AID THOSE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN THE RAPID MULTIPLICATION OF COLONIES BY ARTIFICIAL MEANS A SOLID BLOCK ABOUT AN INCH AND A QUARTER THICK IS SUBSTITUTED FOR ONE OF MY FRAMES HOLES
3977-185466-0005 ABOUT ONE AND A HALF INCHES IN DIAMETER ARE BORED THROUGH IT AND COVERED ON BOTH SIDES WITH GAUZE WIRE SLIDES THE WIRE OUGHT TO BE SUCH AS WILL ALLOW A COMMON BEE TO PASS THROUGH
3977-185466-0006 BUT SHOULD BE TOO SMALL TO PERMIT A QUEEN TO DO THE SAME ANY KIND OF PERFORATED COVER MAY BE MADE TO ANSWER THE SAME PURPOSE AS THE GAUZE WIRE IF A NUMBER OF SEALED QUEENS ARE ON HAND
3977-185466-0007 HE MAY VERY CAREFULLY CUT OUT THE COMBS CONTAINING THEM AND PLACE THEM EACH IN A SEPARATE CRADLE THE BEES HAVING ACCESS TO THEM WILL GIVE THEM PROPER ATTENTION AND AS SOON AS THEY ARE HATCHED WILL SUPPLY THEM WITH FOOD
3977-185466-0008 AND THUS THEY WILL ALWAYS BE ON HAND FOR USE WHEN THEY ARE NEEDED THIS NURSERY MUST OF COURSE BE ESTABLISHED IN A HIVE WHICH HAS NO MATURE QUEEN OR IT WILL QUICKLY BE TRANSFORMED INTO A SLAUGHTER HOUSE BY THE BEES
3977-185466-0009 I HAVE NOT YET TESTED THIS PLAN SO THOROUGHLY AS TO BE CERTAIN THAT IT WILL SUCCEED AND I KNOW SO WELL THE IMMENSE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEORETICAL CONJECTURES AND PRACTICAL RESULTS THAT I CONSIDER NOTHING IN THE BEE LINE
3977-185466-0010 OR INDEED IN ANY OTHER LINE AS ESTABLISHED UNTIL IT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE MOST RIGOROUS DEMONSTRATIONS AND HAS TRIUMPHANTLY PASSED FROM THE MERE REGIONS OF THE BRAIN TO THOSE OF ACTUAL FACT
3977-185466-0011 A THEORY ON ANY SUBJECT MAY SEEM SO PLAUSIBLE AS ALMOST TO AMOUNT TO A POSITIVE DEMONSTRATION AND YET WHEN PUT TO THE WORKING TEST IT IS OFTEN FOUND TO BE ENCUMBERED BY SOME UNFORESEEN DIFFICULTY
3977-185466-0012 WHICH SPEEDILY CONVINCES EVEN ITS SANGUINE PROJECTOR THAT IT HAS NO PRACTICAL VALUE NINE THINGS OUT OF TEN MAY WORK TO A CHARM AND YET THE TENTH MAY BE SO CONNECTED WITH THE OTHER NINE
3977-185466-0013 THAT ITS FAILURE RENDERS THEIR SUCCESS OF NO ACCOUNT WHEN I FIRST USED THIS NURSERY I DID NOT GIVE THE BEES ACCESS TO IT AND I FOUND THAT THE QUEENS WERE NOT PROPERLY DEVELOPED AND DIED IN THEIR CELLS
3977-185466-0014 PERHAPS THEY DID NOT RECEIVE SUFFICIENT WARMTH OR WERE NOT TREATED IN SOME OTHER IMPORTANT RESPECTS
3977-185466-0015 IN THE MULTIPLICITY OF MY EXPERIMENTS I DID NOT REPEAT THIS ONE UNDER A SUFFICIENT VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES TO ASCERTAIN THE PRECISE CAUSE OF FAILURE NOR HAVE I AS YET
3977-185466-0016 TRIED WHETHER IT WILL ANSWER PERFECTLY BY ADMITTING THE BEES TO THE QUEEN CELLS LAST SPRING I MADE ONE QUEEN SUPPLY SEVERAL HIVES WITH EGGS SO AS TO KEEP THEM STRONG IN NUMBERS
3977-185466-0017 WHILE THEY WERE CONSTANTLY ENGAGED IN REARING A LARGE NUMBER OF SPARE QUEENS TWO HIVES WHICH I SHALL CALL A AND B WERE DEPRIVED AT INTERVALS OF A WEEK
3977-185466-0018 AS SOON AS THE QUEENS IN A WERE OF AN AGE SUITABLE TO BE REMOVED I TOOK THEM AWAY AND GAVE THE COLONY A FERTILE QUEEN FROM ANOTHER HIVE C AS SOON AS SHE HAD LAID A LARGE NUMBER OF EGGS IN THE EMPTY CELLS
3977-185466-0019 WERE SEALED OVER THESE WERE NOW REMOVED AND THE QUEEN RESTORED SHE HAD THUS MADE ONE CIRCUIT AND LAID A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF EGGS IN THE TWO HIVES WHICH WERE FIRST DEPRIVED OF THEIR QUEENS
3977-185466-0020 AFTER ALLOWING HER TO REPLENISH HER OWN HIVE WITH EGGS I SENT HER OUT AGAIN ON HER PERAMBULATING MISSION AND BY THIS NEW DEVICE WAS ABLE TO GET AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF YOUNG QUEENS FROM THE THREE HIVES
3977-185466-0021 AND AT THE SAME TIME TO PRESERVE THEIR NUMBERS FROM SERIOUSLY DIMINISHING TWO QUEENS MAY IN THIS WAY BE MADE IN SIX HIVES TO FURNISH ALL THE SUPERNUMERARY QUEENS WHICH WILL BE WANTED IN QUITE A LARGE APIARY
3977-185466-0022 IT WILL BE PERFECTLY OBVIOUS TO EVERY INTELLIGENT AND INGENIOUS APIARIAN THAT THE PERFECT CONTROL OF THE COMB IS THE SOUL OF AN ENTIRELY NEW SYSTEM OF PRACTICAL MANAGEMENT
3977-185466-0023 AND THAT IT MAY BE MODIFIED TO SUIT THE WANTS OF ALL WHO WISH TO CULTIVATE BEES EVEN THE ADVOCATE OF THE OLD FASHIONED PLAN OF KILLING THE BEES CAN WITH ONE OF MY HIVES DESTROY HIS FAITHFUL LABORERS
3977-185466-0024 BY SHAKING THEM INTO A TUB OF WATER ALMOST IF NOT QUITE AS SPEEDILY AS BY SETTING THEM OVER A SULPHUR PIT WHILE AFTER THE WORK OF DEATH IS ACCOMPLISHED HIS HONEY WILL BE FREE FROM DISGUSTING FUMES
3977-185466-0025 AND ALL THE LABOR OF CUTTING IT OUT OF THE HIVE MAY BE DISPENSED WITH I AM NOW PREPARED TO ANSWER AN OBJECTION WHICH DOUBTLESS HAS BEEN PRESENT IN THE MINDS OF MANY ALL THE TIME THAT THEY HAVE BEEN READING THE VARIOUS PROCESSES
3977-185466-0026 THE TRUTH IS THAT SOME PERSONS ARE SO VERY TIMID OR SUFFER SO DREADFULLY FROM THE STING OF A BEE THAT THEY ARE EVERY WAY DISQUALIFIED FROM HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEM AND OUGHT EITHER TO HAVE NO BEES UPON THEIR PREMISES
3977-185466-0027 MAY DISPENSE ENTIRELY WITH ANY PROTECTION I FIND IN SHORT THAT THE RISK OF BEING STUNG IS REALLY DIMINISHED BY THE USE OF MY HIVES
3977-185466-0028 FOR SOME NEW HIVE OR NEW PLAN BY WHICH WITH LITTLE OR NO TROUBLE THEY MAY REAP COPIOUS HARVESTS OF THE PRECIOUS NECTAR THIS IS EMPHATICALLY THE CLASS TO SEIZE HOLD OF EVERY NEW DEVICE
3977-185466-0029 AND WASTE THEIR TIME AND MONEY TO FILL THE COFFERS OF THE IGNORANT OR UNPRINCIPLED THERE NEVER WILL BE A ROYAL ROAD TO PROFITABLE BEE KEEPING IF THERE IS ANY BRANCH OF RURAL ECONOMY WHICH MORE
3977-185466-0030 THAN ALL OTHERS DEMANDS CARE AND EXPERIENCE FOR ITS PROFITABLE MANAGEMENT IT IS THE KEEPING OF BEES AND THOSE WHO HAVE A PAINFUL CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE DISPOSITION TO PUT OFF AND NEGLECT WAS SO TO SPEAK
3977-185466-0031 BORN IN THEM AND HAS NEVER BEEN GOT OUT OF THEM WILL DO WELL TO LET BEES ALONE UNLESS THEY HOPE BY THE STUDY OF THEIR SYSTEMATIC INDUSTRY TO REFORM EVIL HABITS WHICH ARE WELL NIGH INCURABLE
3977-185466-0032 THAT MY SYSTEM OF MANAGEMENT WILL BE USED EXTENSIVELY AND VERY ADVANTAGEOUSLY BY CAREFUL AND SKILLFUL APIARIANS I KNOW TOO MUCH OF THE WORLD TO EXPECT THAT IT WILL WITH THE MASSES
3977-185466-0033 VERY SPEEDILY SUPERCEDE OTHER METHODS EVEN IF IT WERE SO ABSOLUTELY PERFECT AS TO ADMIT OF NO POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENT I HOPE HOWEVER THAT I MAY WITHOUT BEING CHARGED WITH PRESUMPTION
3977-185466-0034 BE PERMITTED TO PUT ON RECORD THE PREDICTION THAT MOVABLE FRAMES WILL IN DUE SEASON BE ALMOST UNIVERSALLY EMPLOYED
3977-185466-0035 WHETHER BEES ARE ALLOWED TO SWARM NATURALLY OR ARE INCREASED BY ARTIFICIAL MEANS OR ARE KEPT IN HIVES IN WHICH THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO SWARM AT ALL NOTE
3977-185466-0036 SO PERFECTLY SIMPLE AND YET SO EFFICACIOUS OF GAINING THE CONTROL OF THE COMBS BY THESE FRAMES
