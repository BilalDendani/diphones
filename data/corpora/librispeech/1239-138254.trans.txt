1239-138254-0000 THE CONSEQUENCES OF A DEVIATION BARBICANE HAD NOW NO FEAR OF THE ISSUE OF THE JOURNEY AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE PROJECTILE'S IMPULSIVE FORCE WAS CONCERNED ITS OWN SPEED WOULD CARRY IT BEYOND THE NEUTRAL LINE
1239-138254-0001 IT WOULD CERTAINLY NOT RETURN TO EARTH IT WOULD CERTAINLY NOT REMAIN MOTIONLESS ON THE LINE OF ATTRACTION ONE SINGLE HYPOTHESIS REMAINED TO BE REALIZED THE ARRIVAL OF THE PROJECTILE AT ITS DESTINATION BY THE ACTION OF THE LUNAR ATTRACTION
1239-138254-0002 IT WAS IN REALITY A FALL OF EIGHT THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY SIX LEAGUES ON AN ORB IT IS TRUE WHERE WEIGHT COULD ONLY BE RECKONED AT ONE SIXTH OF TERRESTRIAL WEIGHT A FORMIDABLE FALL NEVERTHELESS
1239-138254-0003 AND ONE AGAINST WHICH EVERY PRECAUTION MUST BE TAKEN WITHOUT DELAY THESE PRECAUTIONS WERE OF TWO SORTS SOME TO DEADEN THE SHOCK WHEN THE PROJECTILE SHOULD TOUCH THE LUNAR SOIL OTHERS TO DELAY THE FALL AND CONSEQUENTLY MAKE IT LESS VIOLENT
1239-138254-0004 TO DEADEN THE SHOCK IT WAS A PITY THAT BARBICANE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO EMPLOY THE MEANS WHICH HAD SO ABLY WEAKENED THE SHOCK AT DEPARTURE THAT IS TO SAY BY WATER USED AS SPRINGS AND THE PARTITION BREAKS THE PARTITIONS STILL EXISTED
1239-138254-0005 BUT WATER FAILED FOR THEY COULD NOT USE THEIR RESERVE WHICH WAS PRECIOUS IN CASE DURING THE FIRST DAYS THE LIQUID ELEMENT SHOULD BE FOUND WANTING ON LUNAR SOIL AND INDEED THIS RESERVE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE INSUFFICIENT FOR A SPRING
1239-138254-0006 OCCUPIED NO LESS THAN THREE FEET IN DEPTH AND SPREAD OVER A SURFACE OF NOT LESS THAN FIFTY FOUR SQUARE FEET BESIDES THE CISTERN DID NOT CONTAIN ONE FIFTH PART OF IT THEY MUST THEREFORE GIVE UP THIS EFFICIENT MEANS OF DEADENING THE SHOCK OF ARRIVAL
1239-138254-0007 HAPPILY BARBICANE NOT CONTENT WITH EMPLOYING WATER HAD FURNISHED THE MOVABLE DISC WITH STRONG SPRING PLUGS DESTINED TO LESSEN THE SHOCK AGAINST THE BASE AFTER THE BREAKING OF THE HORIZONTAL PARTITIONS THESE PLUGS STILL EXISTED
1239-138254-0008 EVERY PIECE EASY TO HANDLE AS THEIR WEIGHT WAS NOW SCARCELY FELT WAS QUICKLY MOUNTED THE DIFFERENT PIECES WERE FITTED WITHOUT TROUBLE IT BEING ONLY A MATTER OF BOLTS AND SCREWS
1239-138254-0009 TOOLS WERE NOT WANTING AND SOON THE REINSTATED DISC LAY ON STEEL PLUGS LIKE A TABLE ON ITS LEGS ONE INCONVENIENCE RESULTED FROM THE REPLACING OF THE DISC THE LOWER WINDOW WAS BLOCKED UP
1239-138254-0010 THUS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE TRAVELERS TO OBSERVE THE MOON FROM THAT OPENING WHILE THEY WERE BEING PRECIPITATED PERPENDICULARLY UPON HER BUT THEY WERE OBLIGED TO GIVE IT UP EVEN BY THE SIDE OPENINGS THEY COULD STILL SEE VAST LUNAR REGIONS
1239-138254-0011 AS AN AERONAUT SEES THE EARTH FROM HIS CAR THIS REPLACING OF THE DISC WAS AT LEAST AN HOUR'S WORK IT WAS PAST TWELVE WHEN ALL PREPARATIONS WERE FINISHED BARBICANE TOOK FRESH OBSERVATIONS ON THE INCLINATION OF THE PROJECTILE
1239-138254-0012 BUT TO HIS ANNOYANCE IT HAD NOT TURNED OVER SUFFICIENTLY FOR ITS FALL IT SEEMED TO TAKE A CURVE PARALLEL TO THE LUNAR DISC THE ORB OF NIGHT SHONE SPLENDIDLY INTO SPACE WHILE OPPOSITE THE ORB OF DAY BLAZED WITH FIRE
1239-138254-0013 THEIR SITUATION BEGAN TO MAKE THEM UNEASY ARE WE REACHING OUR DESTINATION SAID NICHOLL LET US ACT AS IF WE WERE ABOUT REACHING IT REPLIED BARBICANE YOU ARE SCEPTICAL
1239-138254-0014 RETORTED MICHEL ARDAN WE SHALL ARRIVE AND THAT TOO QUICKER THAN WE LIKE THIS ANSWER BROUGHT BARBICANE BACK TO HIS PREPARATIONS AND HE OCCUPIED HIMSELF WITH PLACING THE CONTRIVANCES INTENDED TO BREAK THEIR DESCENT
1239-138254-0015 WE MAY REMEMBER THE SCENE OF THE MEETING HELD AT TAMPA TOWN IN FLORIDA WHEN CAPTAIN NICHOLL CAME FORWARD AS BARBICANE'S ENEMY AND MICHEL ARDAN'S ADVERSARY TO CAPTAIN NICHOLL'S MAINTAINING THAT THE PROJECTILE WOULD SMASH LIKE GLASS
1239-138254-0016 MICHEL REPLIED THAT HE WOULD BREAK THEIR FALL BY MEANS OF ROCKETS PROPERLY PLACED THUS POWERFUL FIREWORKS TAKING THEIR STARTING POINT FROM THE BASE AND BURSTING OUTSIDE COULD BY PRODUCING A RECOIL CHECK TO A CERTAIN DEGREE THE PROJECTILE'S SPEED
1239-138254-0017 THESE ROCKETS WERE TO BURN IN SPACE IT IS TRUE BUT OXYGEN WOULD NOT FAIL THEM FOR THEY COULD SUPPLY THEMSELVES WITH IT LIKE THE LUNAR VOLCANOES THE BURNING OF WHICH HAS NEVER YET BEEN STOPPED BY THE WANT OF ATMOSPHERE ROUND THE MOON
1239-138254-0018 BARBICANE HAD ACCORDINGLY SUPPLIED HIMSELF WITH THESE FIREWORKS ENCLOSED IN LITTLE STEEL GUNS WHICH COULD BE SCREWED ON TO THE BASE OF THE PROJECTILE INSIDE THESE GUNS WERE FLUSH WITH THE BOTTOM OUTSIDE THEY PROTRUDED ABOUT EIGHTEEN INCHES
1239-138254-0019 THERE WERE TWENTY OF THEM AN OPENING LEFT IN THE DISC ALLOWED THEM TO LIGHT THE MATCH WITH WHICH EACH WAS PROVIDED ALL THE EFFECT WAS FELT OUTSIDE THE BURNING MIXTURE HAD ALREADY BEEN RAMMED INTO EACH GUN
1239-138254-0020 THEY HAD THEN NOTHING TO DO BUT RAISE THE METALLIC BUFFERS FIXED IN THE BASE AND REPLACE THEM BY THE GUNS WHICH FITTED CLOSELY IN THEIR PLACES THIS NEW WORK WAS FINISHED ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK AND AFTER TAKING ALL THESE PRECAUTIONS THERE REMAINED BUT TO WAIT
1239-138254-0021 BUT THE PROJECTILE WAS PERCEPTIBLY NEARING THE MOON AND EVIDENTLY SUCCUMBED TO HER INFLUENCE TO A CERTAIN DEGREE
1239-138254-0022 FROM THESE CONFLICTING INFLUENCES RESULTED A LINE WHICH MIGHT BECOME A TANGENT BUT IT WAS CERTAIN THAT THE PROJECTILE WOULD NOT FALL DIRECTLY ON THE MOON FOR ITS LOWER PART BY REASON OF ITS WEIGHT OUGHT TO BE TURNED TOWARD HER
1239-138254-0023 BARBICANE'S UNEASINESS INCREASED AS HE SAW HIS PROJECTILE RESIST THE INFLUENCE OF GRAVITATION THE UNKNOWN WAS OPENING BEFORE HIM THE UNKNOWN IN INTERPLANETARY SPACE THE MAN OF SCIENCE THOUGHT HE HAD FORESEEN THE ONLY THREE HYPOTHESES POSSIBLE
1239-138254-0024 THE RETURN TO THE EARTH THE RETURN TO THE MOON OR STAGNATION ON THE NEUTRAL LINE AND HERE A FOURTH HYPOTHESIS BIG WITH ALL THE TERRORS OF THE INFINITE SURGED UP INOPPORTUNELY TO FACE IT WITHOUT FLINCHING
1239-138254-0025 ONE MUST BE A RESOLUTE SAVANT LIKE BARBICANE A PHLEGMATIC BEING LIKE NICHOLL OR AN AUDACIOUS ADVENTURER LIKE MICHEL ARDAN CONVERSATION WAS STARTED UPON THIS SUBJECT
1239-138254-0026 THEY WOULD HAVE ASKED THEMSELVES WHITHER THEIR PROJECTILE CARRIAGE WAS CARRYING THEM NOT SO WITH THESE THEY SOUGHT FOR THE CAUSE WHICH PRODUCED THIS EFFECT SO WE HAVE BECOME DIVERTED FROM OUR ROUTE SAID MICHEL BUT WHY
1239-138254-0027 I VERY MUCH FEAR ANSWERED NICHOLL THAT IN SPITE OF ALL PRECAUTIONS TAKEN THE COLUMBIAD WAS NOT FAIRLY POINTED AN ERROR HOWEVER SMALL WOULD BE ENOUGH TO THROW US OUT OF THE MOON'S ATTRACTION
1239-138254-0028 THEN THEY MUST HAVE AIMED BADLY ASKED MICHEL I DO NOT THINK SO REPLIED BARBICANE THE PERPENDICULARITY OF THE GUN WAS EXACT ITS DIRECTION TO THE ZENITH OF THE SPOT INCONTESTIBLE
1239-138254-0029 AND THE MOON PASSING TO THE ZENITH OF THE SPOT WE OUGHT TO REACH IT AT THE FULL THERE IS ANOTHER REASON BUT IT ESCAPES ME ARE WE NOT ARRIVING TOO LATE ASKED NICHOLL TOO LATE SAID BARBICANE YES CONTINUED NICHOLL
1239-138254-0030 THE CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY'S NOTE SAYS THAT THE TRANSIT OUGHT TO BE ACCOMPLISHED IN NINETY SEVEN HOURS THIRTEEN MINUTES AND TWENTY SECONDS WHICH MEANS TO SAY THAT SOONER THE MOON WILL NOT BE AT THE POINT INDICATED AND LATER IT WILL HAVE PASSED IT TRUE
1239-138254-0031 AND WE OUGHT TO ARRIVE ON THE FIFTH AT MIDNIGHT AT THE EXACT MOMENT WHEN THE MOON WOULD BE FULL
1239-138254-0032 IT IS NOW HALF PAST THREE IN THE EVENING HALF PAST EIGHT OUGHT TO SEE US AT THE END OF OUR JOURNEY WHY DO WE NOT ARRIVE MIGHT IT NOT BE AN EXCESS OF SPEED ANSWERED NICHOLL FOR WE KNOW NOW THAT ITS INITIAL VELOCITY WAS GREATER THAN THEY SUPPOSED
1239-138254-0033 NO A HUNDRED TIMES NO REPLIED BARBICANE AN EXCESS OF SPEED IF THE DIRECTION OF THE PROJECTILE HAD BEEN RIGHT WOULD NOT HAVE PREVENTED US REACHING THE MOON NO
1239-138254-0034 WE HAVE BEEN TURNED OUT OF OUR COURSE BY WHOM BY WHAT ASKED NICHOLL I CANNOT SAY REPLIED BARBICANE VERY WELL THEN BARBICANE SAID MICHEL
1239-138254-0035 DO YOU WISH TO KNOW MY OPINION ON THE SUBJECT OF FINDING OUT THIS DEVIATION SPEAK I WOULD NOT GIVE HALF A DOLLAR TO KNOW IT THAT WE HAVE DEVIATED IS A FACT WHERE WE ARE GOING MATTERS LITTLE WE SHALL SOON SEE
1239-138254-0036 SINCE WE ARE BEING BORNE ALONG IN SPACE WE SHALL END BY FALLING INTO SOME CENTER OF ATTRACTION OR OTHER MICHEL ARDAN'S INDIFFERENCE DID NOT CONTENT BARBICANE NOT THAT HE WAS UNEASY ABOUT THE FUTURE
1239-138254-0037 BUT HE WANTED TO KNOW AT ANY COST WHY HIS PROJECTILE HAD DEVIATED BUT THE PROJECTILE CONTINUED ITS COURSE SIDEWAYS TO THE MOON AND WITH IT THE MASS OF THINGS THROWN OUT BARBICANE COULD EVEN PROVE BY THE ELEVATIONS WHICH SERVED AS LANDMARKS UPON THE MOON
1239-138254-0038 WHICH WAS ONLY TWO THOUSAND LEAGUES DISTANT THAT ITS SPEED WAS BECOMING UNIFORM FRESH PROOF THAT THERE WAS NO FALL ITS IMPULSIVE FORCE STILL PREVAILED OVER THE LUNAR ATTRACTION BUT THE PROJECTILE'S COURSE WAS CERTAINLY BRINGING IT NEARER TO THE MOON
1239-138254-0039 AND THEY MIGHT HOPE THAT AT A NEARER POINT THE WEIGHT PREDOMINATING WOULD CAUSE A DECIDED FALL THE THREE FRIENDS HAVING NOTHING BETTER TO DO CONTINUED THEIR OBSERVATIONS BUT THEY COULD NOT YET DETERMINE THE TOPOGRAPHICAL POSITION OF THE SATELLITE
1239-138254-0040 EVERY RELIEF WAS LEVELED UNDER THE REFLECTION OF THE SOLAR RAYS THEY WATCHED THUS THROUGH THE SIDE WINDOWS UNTIL EIGHT O'CLOCK AT NIGHT THE MOON HAD GROWN SO LARGE IN THEIR EYES THAT IT FILLED HALF OF THE FIRMAMENT THE SUN ON ONE SIDE AND THE ORB OF NIGHT ON THE OTHER
1239-138254-0041 FLOODED THE PROJECTILE WITH LIGHT AT THAT MOMENT BARBICANE THOUGHT HE COULD ESTIMATE THE DISTANCE WHICH SEPARATED THEM FROM THEIR AIM AT NO MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED LEAGUES THE SPEED OF THE PROJECTILE SEEMED TO HIM TO BE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
1239-138254-0042 OR ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY LEAGUES A SECOND UNDER THE CENTRIPETAL FORCE THE BASE OF THE PROJECTILE TENDED TOWARD THE MOON BUT THE CENTRIFUGAL STILL PREVAILED AND IT WAS PROBABLE THAT ITS RECTILINEAL COURSE WOULD BE CHANGED TO A CURVE OF SOME SORT
1239-138254-0043 THE NATURE OF WHICH THEY COULD NOT AT PRESENT DETERMINE BARBICANE WAS STILL SEEKING THE SOLUTION OF HIS INSOLUBLE PROBLEM HOURS PASSED WITHOUT ANY RESULT THE PROJECTILE WAS EVIDENTLY NEARING THE MOON
1239-138254-0044 AS TO THE NEAREST DISTANCE AT WHICH IT WOULD PASS HER THAT MUST BE THE RESULT OF TWO FORCES ATTRACTION AND REPULSION AFFECTING ITS MOTION I ASK BUT ONE THING SAID MICHEL THAT WE MAY PASS NEAR ENOUGH TO PENETRATE HER SECRETS
1239-138254-0045 CRIED NICHOLL AND AS IF A LIGHT HAD SUDDENLY BROKEN IN UPON HIS MIND BARBICANE ANSWERED
1239-138254-0046 WHAT SAID MICHEL ARDAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN EXCLAIMED NICHOLL I MEAN
1239-138254-0047 I MEAN THAT OUR DEVIATION IS OWING SOLELY TO OUR MEETING WITH THIS ERRING BODY BUT IT DID NOT EVEN BRUSH US AS IT PASSED SAID MICHEL WHAT DOES THAT MATTER ITS MASS COMPARED TO THAT OF OUR PROJECTILE WAS ENORMOUS
1239-138254-0048 AND ITS ATTRACTION WAS ENOUGH TO INFLUENCE OUR COURSE SO LITTLE CRIED NICHOLL
