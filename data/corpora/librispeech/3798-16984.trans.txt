3798-16984-0000 THE NEXT MORNING KIT AND KAT WOKE UP VERY EARLY WITHOUT ANY ONE'S CALLING THEM YOU SEE THEY WERE AFRAID THEY WOULD BE TOO LATE TO GO WITH THE MILK CART BUT GRANDFATHER WINKLE
3798-16984-0001 HAD ONLY JUST GONE OUT TO GET THE MILK READY AND THEY HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO DRESS WHILE GRANDMOTHER GOT BREAKFAST GRANDMOTHER HELPED WITH THE BUTTONS AND THE HARD PARTS GRANDMOTHER WINKLE'S KITCHEN WAS QUITE LIKE THE KITCHEN AT HOME
3798-16984-0002 ONLY A LITTLE NICER IT HAD RED TILES ON THE FLOOR AND IT HAD EVER SO MANY BLUE PLATES HANGING AROUND ON THE WALLS AND STANDING ON EDGE IN A ROW ON THE SHELVES

3798-16984-0004 WHEN THE TWINS WERE ALL DRESSED GRANDMOTHER SAID MERCY SAKES YOU HAVE ON YOUR BEST CLOTHES NOW THAT'S JUST LIKE A MAN TO PROMISE TO TAKE YOU OUT IN YOUR BEST CLOTHES IN A MILK WAGON
3798-16984-0005 WHATEVER WAS GRANDFATHER THINKING ABOUT KIT AND KAT THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO SAY THAT THEY COULDN'T GO SO THEY DUG THEIR KNUCKLES IN THEIR EYES AND BEGAN TO CRY BUT THEY HADN'T GOT FARTHER THAN THE FIRST WHIMPER
3798-16984-0006 WHEN GRANDMOTHER SAID WELL WELL WE MUST FIX IT SOMEHOW DON'T CRY NOW THAT'S A GOOD KIT AND KAT SO THE TWINS TOOK THEIR KNUCKLES OUT OF THEIR EYES AND BEGAN TO SMILE GRANDMOTHER
3798-16984-0007 WENT TO THE PRESS AND BROUGHT OUT TWO APRONS ONE WAS A VERY SMALL APRON IT WOULDN'T REACH TO KIT'S KNEES BUT SHE PUT IT ON HIM AND TIED IT AROUND HIS WAIST
3798-16984-0008 HAD TAKEN IT WITH HIM WHEN HE WENT TO AMERICA BUT HE DIDN'T SAY SO THEN GRANDMOTHER TOOK ANOTHER APRON OUT OF THE PRESS IT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN THERE A LONG TIME
3798-16984-0009 IT WAS YOUR MOTHER'S WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL NOW THIS APRON WAS ALL FADED AND IT HAD PATCHES ON IT OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF CLOTH KAT LOOKED AT HER BEST DRESS THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE APRON THEN SHE THOUGHT ABOUT THE MILK CART
3798-16984-0010 SHE WONDERED IF SHE WANTED TO GO IN THE MILK CART BADLY ENOUGH TO WEAR THAT APRON OVER HER SUNDAY DRESS SHE STUCK HER FINGER IN HER MOUTH AND LOOKED SIDEWISE AT GRANDMOTHER WINKLE GRANDMOTHER
3798-16984-0011 SHE JUST LOOKED FIRM AND HELD UP THE APRON VERY SOON KAT CAME SLOWLY VERY SLOWLY AND GRANDMOTHER BUTTONED THE APRON UP BEHIND AND THAT WAS THE END OF THAT
3798-16984-0012 THE TWINS COULD HARDLY EAT ANY BREAKFAST THEY WERE IN SUCH A HURRY TO GO AS SOON AS THEY HAD TAKEN THE LAST SPOONFUL AND GRANDFATHER WINKLE HAD FINISHED HIS COFFEE THEY RAN OUT INTO THE PLACE WHERE THE DOGS WERE KEPT
3798-16984-0013 TO HELP GRANDFATHER HARNESS THEM THERE WERE TWO BLACK AND WHITE DOGS THEIR NAMES WERE PETER AND PAUL THE WAGON WAS SMALL JUST THE RIGHT SIZE FOR THE DOGS AND IT WAS PAINTED BLUE

3798-16984-0017 AND AS THEY STARTED AWAY KAT TOOK ONE HAND OFF THE CART LONG ENOUGH TO WAVE IT TO HER THEN SHE HELD ON AGAIN FOR THE BRICKS IN THE PAVEMENT MADE THE CART JOGGLE A GOOD DEAL
