7062-80029-0000 THE PARTY AT RUDHAM PARK HAD HARDLY BEEN A SUCCESS NOR WAS IT MUCH IMPROVED IN WIT OR GAIETY WHEN MISSUS MONTACUTE JONES LORD GIBLET AND JACK DE BARON HAD GONE AWAY
7062-80029-0001 HAD COME IN THEIR PLACES THIS BLACK INFLUX AS LORD BROTHERTON CALLED IT HAD ALL BEEN DUE TO CONSIDERATION FOR HIS LORDSHIP MISTER DE BARON THOUGHT THAT HIS GUEST WOULD LIKE TO SEE AT ANY RATE ONE OF HIS OWN FAMILY
7062-80029-0002 AS TO MISTER GROSCHUT HE WAS THE DEAN'S BITTEREST ENEMY AND WOULD THEREFORE IT WAS THOUGHT BE WELCOME THE BISHOP HAD BEEN ASKED AS MISTER DE BARON WAS ONE WHO FOUND IT EXPEDIENT TO MAKE SACRIFICES TO RESPECTABILITY
7062-80029-0003 BUT AS WAS WELL KNOWN THE BISHOP NEVER WENT ANYWHERE EXCEPT TO CLERICAL HOUSES MISTER GROSCHUT WHO WAS A YOUNGER MAN KNEW THAT IT BEHOVED HIM TO BE ALL THINGS TO ALL MEN AND THAT HE COULD NOT BE EFFICACIOUS AMONG SINNERS UNLESS HE WOULD ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE SEEN IN THEIR PATHS
7062-80029-0004 CARE WAS OF COURSE TAKEN THAT LADY ALICE SHOULD FIND HERSELF ALONE WITH HER BROTHER IT WAS PROBABLY EXPECTED THAT THE MARQUIS WOULD BE REGARDED AS LESS OF AN OGRE IN THE COUNTRY IF IT WERE KNOWN THAT HE HAD HAD COMMUNICATION WITH ONE OF THE FAMILY WITHOUT QUARRELLING WITH HER
7062-80029-0005 SO YOU'RE COME HERE HE SAID I DIDN'T KNOW THAT PEOPLE SO PIOUS WOULD ENTER DE BARON'S DOORS MISTER DE BARON IS A VERY OLD FRIEND OF THE CANON'S I HOPE HE ISN'T VERY WICKED AND I'M AFRAID WE ARE NOT VERY PIOUS IF YOU DON'T OBJECT OF COURSE I DON'T
7062-80029-0006 SO THEY'VE ALL GONE BACK TO THE OLD HOUSE MAMMA IS THERE AND GEORGE HE ASKED IN A SHARP TONE AND GEORGE AT PRESENT GEORGE IS I THINK THE BIGGEST FOOL I EVER CAME ACROSS IN MY LIFE
7062-80029-0007 HE IS SO COWED BY THAT MAN WHOSE DAUGHTER HE HAS MARRIED THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO CALL HIS SOUL HIS OWN I DON'T THINK THAT BROTHERTON HE NEVER GOES TO THE DEANERY TO STAY THERE THEN WHAT MAKES HIM QUARREL WITH ME HE OUGHT TO KNOW WHICH SIDE HIS BREAD IS BUTTERED
7062-80029-0008 IF HE THINKS HIS BREAD IS BUTTERED ON THAT SIDE LET HIM STICK TO THAT SIDE AND SAY SO I WILL REGARD NONE OF MY FAMILY AS ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH ME WHO ASSOCIATE WITH THE DEAN OF BROTHERTON OR HIS DAUGHTER AFTER WHAT TOOK PLACE UP IN LONDON
7062-80029-0009 LADY ALICE FELT THIS TO BE A DISTINCT THREAT TO HERSELF BUT SHE ALLOWED IT TO PASS BY WITHOUT NOTICE SHE WAS QUITE SURE THAT THE CANON WOULD NOT QUARREL WITH THE DEAN OUT OF DEFERENCE TO HIS BROTHER IN LAW
7062-80029-0010 THE FACT IS THEY SHOULD ALL HAVE GONE AWAY AS I TOLD THEM AND ESPECIALLY WHEN GEORGE HAD MARRIED THE GIRL AND GOT HER MONEY IT DON'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE TO ME BUT IT WILL MAKE A DEAL TO HIM HOW IS POPENJOY BROTHERTON ASKED LADY ALICE ANXIOUS TO CHANGE THE CONVERSATION
7062-80029-0011 I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM WHAT HE HAS GONE BACK TO ITALY WITH HIS MOTHER HOW CAN I TELL ASK THE DEAN I DON'T DOUBT THAT HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT HIM HE HAS PEOPLE FOLLOWING THEM ABOUT AND WATCHING EVERY MOUTHFUL THEY EAT
7062-80029-0012 I THINK HE HAS GIVEN ALL THAT UP NOT HE HE'LL HAVE TO UNLESS HE MEANS TO SPEND MORE MONEY THAN I THINK HE HAS GOT GEORGE IS QUITE SATISFIED ABOUT POPENJOY NOW SAID LADY ALICE I FANCY GEORGE DIDN'T LIKE THE EXPENSE
7062-80029-0013 BUT HE BEGAN IT AND I'LL NEVER FORGIVE HIM I FANCY IT WAS HE AND SARAH BETWEEN THEM
7062-80029-0014 WHY COULDN'T THEY WAIT IS IT SO BAD AS THAT BROTHERTON THEY TELL ME HE IS NOT A YOUNG HERCULES OH YES YOU CAN GIVE MY LOVE TO MY MOTHER TELL HER THAT IF I DON'T SEE HER IT IS ALL GEORGE'S FAULT I AM NOT GOING TO THE HOUSE WHILE HE'S THERE
7062-80029-0015 TO THE CANON HE HARDLY SPOKE A WORD NOR WAS THE CANON VERY ANXIOUS TO TALK TO HIM BUT IT BECAME KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THAT THE MARQUIS HAD MET HIS SISTER AT RUDHAM PARK AND THE GENERAL EFFECT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD
7062-80029-0016 I SHALL GO BACK TO MORROW DE BARON HE SAID TO HIS HOST THAT SAME AFTERNOON THIS WAS THE DAY ON WHICH JACK HAD GONE TO BROTHERTON WE SHALL BE SORRY TO LOSE YOU I'M AFRAID IT HAS BEEN RATHER DULL NOT MORE DULL THAN USUAL
7062-80029-0017 EVERYTHING IS DULL AFTER A CERTAIN TIME OF LIFE UNLESS A MAN HAS MADE SOME FIXED LINE FOR HIMSELF
7062-80029-0018 SOME MEN PLAY CARDS BUT I DIDN'T BEGIN EARLY ENOUGH TO WIN MONEY AND I DON'T LIKE LOSING IT THE SORT OF THINGS THAT A MAN DOES CARE FOR DIE AWAY FROM HIM AND OF COURSE IT BECOMES DULL I WONDER YOU DON'T HAVE A FEW HORSES IN TRAINING I HATE HORSES AND I HATE BEING CHEATED
7062-80029-0019 THEY DON'T CHEAT ME SAID MISTER DE BARON AH VERY LIKELY THEY WOULD ME I THINK I MADE A MISTAKE DE BARON IN NOT STAYING AT HOME AND LOOKING AFTER THE PROPERTY IT'S NOT TOO LATE NOW YES IT IS I COULD NOT DO IT
7062-80029-0020 I COULD NOT REMEMBER THE TENANTS NAMES AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT GAME I CAN'T THROW MYSELF INTO A LITTER OF YOUNG FOXES OR GET INTO A FURY OF PASSION ABOUT PHEASANTS EGGS IT'S ALL BEASTLY NONSENSE BUT IF A FELLOW COULD ONLY BRING HIMSELF TO CARE ABOUT IT THAT WOULDN'T MATTER
7062-80029-0021 I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING YOU READ NO I DON'T I PRETEND TO READ A LITTLE IF THEY HAD LEFT ME ALONE I THINK I SHOULD HAVE HAD MYSELF BLED TO DEATH IN A WARM BATH BUT I WON'T NOW THAT MAN'S DAUGHTER SHAN'T BE LADY BROTHERTON IF I CAN HELP IT
7062-80029-0022 HE'S THE DEPUTY BISHOP OF THE DIOCESE BUT WHY HAVE THE BISHOP HIMSELF UNLESS HE HAPPEN TO BE A FRIEND DOES YOUR DAUGHTER LIKE HER MARRIAGE I HOPE SO SHE DOES NOT COMPLAIN HE'S AN AWFUL ASS AND ALWAYS WAS
7062-80029-0023 I REMEMBER WHEN YOU USED ALWAYS TO FINISH UP YOUR BOOKS BY MAKING HIM BET AS YOU PLEASED HE ALWAYS WON AND NOW YOU'VE MADE HIM MARRY YOUR DAUGHTER PERHAPS HE HAS WON THERE I LIKE HER
7062-80029-0024 IF MY WIFE WOULD DIE AND HE WOULD DIE WE MIGHT GET UP ANOTHER MATCH AND CUT OUT LORD GEORGE AFTER ALL THIS SPECULATION WAS TOO DEEP EVEN FOR MISTER DE BARON WHO LAUGHED AND SHUFFLED HIMSELF ABOUT AND GOT OUT OF THE ROOM WOULDN'T YOU HAVE LIKED TO BE A MARCHIONESS HE SAID SOME HOURS AFTERWARDS TO MISSUS HOUGHTON
7062-80029-0025 AND HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO HEAR ODD THINGS FROM HIM HE LIKED HER BECAUSE HE COULD SAY WHAT HE PLEASED TO HER AND SHE WOULD LAUGH AND LISTEN AND SHOW NO OFFENCE BUT THIS LAST QUESTION WAS VERY ODD
7062-80029-0026 BUT IN THAT CASE HAD SHE MARRIED LORD GEORGE SHE COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN MADE A MARCHIONESS BY HIS OWN DEATH BY THAT AND BY THE DEATH OF THE LITTLE POPENJOY OF WHOM SHE HAD HEARD SO MUCH
7062-80029-0027 I DON'T MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE MURDERED ANYBODY SUPPOSE YOU HAD MARRIED ME YOU NEVER ASKED ME MY LORD YOU WERE ONLY EIGHT OR NINE YEARS OLD WHEN I SAW YOU LAST ISN'T IT A PITY YOU DIDN'T GET YOURSELF ENGAGED TO ME THEN SUCH THINGS HAVE BEEN DONE
7062-80029-0028 IF THE COAST WERE CLEAR I WONDER WHETHER YOU'D TAKE ME NOW THE COAST ISN'T CLEAR LORD BROTHERTON NO BY GEORGE I WISH IT WERE AND SO DO YOU TOO IF YOU'D DARE TO SAY SO YOU THINK I SHOULD BE SURE TO TAKE YOU
7062-80029-0029 I'M NOT SO OLD BY TEN YEARS AS HOUGHTON YOUR AGE WOULD NOT BE THE STUMBLING BLOCK WHAT THEN I DIDN'T SAY THERE WOULD BE ANY I DON'T SAY THAT THERE WOULD NOT IT'S A KIND OF THING THAT A WOMAN DOESN'T THINK OF IT'S JUST THE KIND OF THING THAT WOMEN DO THINK OF
7062-80029-0030 THEN THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT LORD BROTHERTON YOUR BROTHER YOU KNOW DID WANT ME TO MARRY HIM WHAT GEORGE BEFORE HOUGHTON CERTAINLY BEFORE I HAD THOUGHT OF MISTER HOUGHTON WHY THE DEUCE DID YOU REFUSE HIM
7062-80029-0031 WHY DID YOU LET HIM TAKE THAT LITTLE HE DID NOT FILL UP THE BLANK BUT MISSUS HOUGHTON QUITE UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE WAS TO SUPPOSE EVERYTHING THAT WAS BAD I NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE IT WASN'T FOR ME TO TELL YOU WHAT AN ASS YOU WERE PERHAPS SO
7062-80029-0032 WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE LIVED UPON PAPA WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN US AN INCOME I COULD BUT YOU WOULDN'T YOU DIDN'T KNOW ME THEN
7062-80029-0033 AND SO GEORGE WANTED TO MARRY YOU WAS HE VERY MUCH IN LOVE I WAS BOUND TO SUPPOSE SO MY LORD AND YOU DIDN'T CARE FOR HIM I DIDN'T SAY THAT BUT I CERTAINLY DID NOT CARE TO SET UP HOUSEKEEPING WITHOUT A HOUSE OR WITHOUT THE MONEY TO GET ONE
7062-80029-0034 WAS I WRONG I SUPPOSE A FELLOW OUGHT TO HAVE MONEY WHEN HE WANTS TO MARRY
7062-80029-0035 WON'T IT BE ODD IF AFTER ALL YOU SHOULD BE MARCHIONESS OF BROTHERTON SOME DAY AFTER THAT WON'T YOU GIVE ME A KISS BEFORE YOU SAY GOOD NIGHT I WOULD HAVE DONE IF YOU HAD BEEN MY BROTHER IN LAW OR PERHAPS IF THE PEOPLE WERE NOT ALL MOVING ABOUT IN THE NEXT ROOM
7062-80029-0036 GOOD NIGHT MARQUIS GOOD NIGHT PERHAPS YOU'LL REGRET SOME DAY THAT YOU HAVEN'T DONE WHAT I ASKED I MIGHT REGRET IT MORE IF I DID THEN SHE TOOK HERSELF OFF ENQUIRING IN HER OWN MIND WHETHER IT MIGHT STILL BE POSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD EVER PRESIDE IN THE DRAWING ROOM AT MANOR CROSS
7062-80029-0037 HAD HE NOT BEEN VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER SURELY HE WOULD NOT HAVE TALKED TO HER LIKE THAT I THINK I'LL SAY GOOD BYE TO YOU DE BARON THE MARQUIS SAID TO HIS HOST THAT NIGHT YOU WON'T BE GOING EARLY NO I NEVER DO ANYTHING EARLY
7062-80029-0038 BUT I DON'T LIKE A FUSS JUST AS I AM GOING I'LL GET DOWN AND DRIVE AWAY TO CATCH SOME TRAIN MY MAN WILL MANAGE IT ALL YOU GO TO LONDON I SHALL BE IN ITALY WITHIN A WEEK I HATE ITALY BUT I THINK I HATE ENGLAND WORSE
7062-80029-0039 WHAT A HURRY I SHOULD BE IN TO DIE LET US KNOW HOW POPENJOY IS YOU'LL BE SURE TO KNOW WHETHER HE IS DEAD OR ALIVE THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO TELL I NEVER WRITE LETTERS EXCEPT TO KNOX AND VERY FEW TO HIM GOOD NIGHT
7062-80029-0040 WHEN THE MARQUIS WAS IN HIS ROOM HIS COURIER OR THE MAN SO CALLED CAME TO UNDRESS HIM HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING TO DAY HE ASKED IN ITALIAN THE MAN SAID THAT HE HAD HEARD A LETTER HAD REACHED HIM THAT AFTERNOON FROM LONDON
7062-80029-0041 THE LETTER HAD DECLARED THAT LITTLE POPENJOY WAS SINKING THAT WILL DO BONNI HE SAID I WILL GET INTO BED BY MYSELF
