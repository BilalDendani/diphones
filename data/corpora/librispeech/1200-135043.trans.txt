1200-135043-0000 WHAT SHE WAS AND WHERE SHE WAS BORN HE NEVER INFORMED US
1200-135043-0001 EVERY OBJECT SHE SAW THE MOMENT SHE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD APPEARED TO DELIGHT HER AND EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT TOOK PLACE ABOUT HER EXCEPT THE PREPARING FOR THE BURIAL AND THE PRESENCE OF THE MOURNERS I THOUGHT SHE WAS HALF SILLY FROM HER BEHAVIOUR WHILE THAT WENT ON
1200-135043-0002 SHE RAN INTO HER CHAMBER AND MADE ME COME WITH HER THOUGH I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DRESSING THE CHILDREN AND THERE SHE SAT SHIVERING AND CLASPING HER HANDS AND ASKING REPEATEDLY
1200-135043-0003 THEN SHE BEGAN DESCRIBING WITH HYSTERICAL EMOTION THE EFFECT IT PRODUCED ON HER TO SEE BLACK AND STARTED AND TREMBLED
1200-135043-0004 BUT SHE FELT SO AFRAID OF DYING I IMAGINED HER AS LITTLE LIKELY TO DIE AS MYSELF SHE WAS RATHER THIN BUT YOUNG AND FRESH COMPLEXIONED AND HER EYES SPARKLED AS BRIGHT AS DIAMONDS I DID REMARK TO BE SURE
1200-135043-0005 THAT MOUNTING THE STAIRS MADE HER BREATHE VERY QUICK THAT THE LEAST SUDDEN NOISE SET HER ALL IN A QUIVER
1200-135043-0006 BUT I KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT THESE SYMPTOMS PORTENDED
1200-135043-0007 WE DON'T IN GENERAL TAKE TO FOREIGNERS HERE MISTER LOCKWOOD UNLESS THEY TAKE TO US FIRST
1200-135043-0008 AND SPOKE AND DRESSED QUITE DIFFERENTLY AND ON THE VERY DAY OF HIS RETURN HE TOLD JOSEPH AND ME WE MUST THENCEFORTH QUARTER OURSELVES IN THE BACK KITCHEN AND LEAVE THE HOUSE FOR HIM
1200-135043-0009 BUT HIS WIFE EXPRESSED SUCH PLEASURE AT THE WHITE FLOOR AND HUGE GLOWING FIREPLACE AT THE PEWTER DISHES AND DELF CASE AND DOG KENNEL AND THE WIDE SPACE THERE WAS TO MOVE ABOUT IN WHERE THEY USUALLY SAT THAT HE THOUGHT IT UNNECESSARY TO HER COMFORT AND SO DROPPED THE INTENTION
1200-135043-0010 SHE EXPRESSED PLEASURE TOO AT FINDING A SISTER AMONG HER NEW ACQUAINTANCE AND SHE PRATTLED TO CATHERINE AND KISSED HER AND RAN ABOUT WITH HER AND GAVE HER QUANTITIES OF PRESENTS AT THE BEGINNING HER AFFECTION TIRED VERY SOON HOWEVER AND WHEN SHE GREW PEEVISH
1200-135043-0011 HINDLEY BECAME TYRANNICAL A FEW WORDS FROM HER EVINCING A DISLIKE TO HEATHCLIFF WERE ENOUGH TO ROUSE IN HIM ALL HIS OLD HATRED OF THE BOY HE DROVE HIM FROM THEIR COMPANY TO THE SERVANTS DEPRIVED HIM OF THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE CURATE
1200-135043-0012 SO THEY KEPT CLEAR OF HIM HE WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE SEEN AFTER THEIR GOING TO CHURCH ON SUNDAYS
1200-135043-0013 AND CATHERINE A FAST FROM DINNER OR SUPPER BUT IT WAS ONE OF THEIR CHIEF AMUSEMENTS TO RUN AWAY TO THE MOORS IN THE MORNING AND REMAIN THERE ALL DAY
1200-135043-0014 THE CURATE MIGHT SET AS MANY CHAPTERS AS HE PLEASED FOR CATHERINE TO GET BY HEART AND JOSEPH MIGHT THRASH HEATHCLIFF TILL HIS ARM ACHED THEY FORGOT EVERYTHING THE MINUTE THEY WERE TOGETHER AGAIN AT LEAST THE MINUTE THEY HAD CONTRIVED SOME NAUGHTY PLAN OF REVENGE
1200-135043-0015 FOR FEAR OF LOSING THE SMALL POWER I STILL RETAINED OVER THE UNFRIENDED CREATURES ONE SUNDAY EVENING
1200-135043-0016 WHERE IS MISS CATHERINE I CRIED HURRIEDLY NO ACCIDENT I HOPE AT THRUSHCROSS GRANGE HE ANSWERED
1200-135043-0017 AND WHILE HE UNDRESSED AND I WAITED TO PUT OUT THE CANDLE HE CONTINUED
1200-135043-0018 AND GETTING A GLIMPSE OF THE GRANGE LIGHTS WE THOUGHT WE WOULD JUST GO AND SEE WHETHER THE LINTONS PASSED THEIR SUNDAY EVENINGS STANDING SHIVERING IN CORNERS WHILE THEIR FATHER AND MOTHER SAT EATING AND DRINKING AND SINGING AND LAUGHING
1200-135043-0019 DON'T CANT NELLY HE SAID NONSENSE WE RAN FROM THE TOP OF THE HEIGHTS TO THE PARK WITHOUT STOPPING CATHERINE COMPLETELY BEATEN IN THE RACE BECAUSE SHE WAS BAREFOOT YOU'LL HAVE TO SEEK FOR HER SHOES IN THE BOG TO MORROW WE CREPT THROUGH A BROKEN HEDGE
1200-135043-0020 AND WE SAW AH IT WAS BEAUTIFUL A SPLENDID PLACE CARPETED WITH CRIMSON AND CRIMSON COVERED CHAIRS AND TABLES AND A PURE WHITE CEILING BORDERED BY GOLD
1200-135043-0021 AND SHIMMERING WITH LITTLE SOFT TAPERS
1200-135043-0022 AND NOW GUESS WHAT YOUR GOOD CHILDREN WERE DOING ISABELLA I BELIEVE SHE IS ELEVEN A YEAR YOUNGER THAN CATHY LAY SCREAMING AT THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM SHRIEKING AS IF WITCHES WERE RUNNING RED HOT NEEDLES INTO HER EDGAR STOOD ON THE HEARTH WEEPING SILENTLY
1200-135043-0023 AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE SAT A LITTLE DOG SHAKING ITS PAW AND YELPING WHICH FROM THEIR MUTUAL ACCUSATIONS WE UNDERSTOOD THEY HAD NEARLY PULLED IN TWO BETWEEN THEM THE IDIOTS THAT WAS THEIR PLEASURE TO QUARREL WHO SHOULD HOLD A HEAP OF WARM HAIR
1200-135043-0024 AND EACH BEGIN TO CRY BECAUSE BOTH AFTER STRUGGLING TO GET IT REFUSED TO TAKE IT WE LAUGHED OUTRIGHT AT THE PETTED THINGS WE DID DESPISE THEM WHEN WOULD YOU CATCH ME WISHING TO HAVE WHAT CATHERINE WANTED
1200-135043-0025 OR FIND US BY OURSELVES SEEKING ENTERTAINMENT IN YELLING AND SOBBING AND ROLLING ON THE GROUND DIVIDED BY THE WHOLE ROOM
1200-135043-0026 THERE WAS SILENCE AND THEN A CRY OH MAMMA MAMMA OH PAPA OH MAMMA COME HERE OH PAPA OH THEY REALLY DID HOWL OUT SOMETHING IN THAT WAY WE MADE FRIGHTFUL NOISES TO TERRIFY THEM STILL MORE
1200-135043-0027 I DID THOUGH I VOCIFERATED CURSES ENOUGH TO ANNIHILATE ANY FIEND IN CHRISTENDOM AND I GOT A STONE AND THRUST IT BETWEEN HIS JAWS AND TRIED WITH ALL MY MIGHT TO CRAM IT DOWN HIS THROAT A BEAST OF A SERVANT CAME UP WITH A LANTERN AT LAST SHOUTING
1200-135043-0028 KEEP FAST SKULKER KEEP FAST HE CHANGED HIS NOTE HOWEVER WHEN HE SAW SKULKER'S GAME THE DOG WAS THROTTLED OFF HIS HUGE PURPLE TONGUE HANGING HALF A FOOT OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND HIS PENDENT LIPS STREAMING WITH BLOODY SLAVER THE MAN TOOK CATHY UP
1200-135043-0029 SHE WAS SICK NOT FROM FEAR I'M CERTAIN BUT FROM PAIN HE CARRIED HER IN I FOLLOWED GRUMBLING EXECRATIONS AND VENGEANCE WHAT PREY ROBERT HALLOOED LINTON FROM THE ENTRANCE SKULKER HAS CAUGHT A LITTLE GIRL SIR
1200-135043-0030 HE REPLIED AND THERE'S A LAD HERE HE ADDED MAKING A CLUTCH AT ME WHO LOOKS AN OUT AND OUTER
1200-135043-0031 THAT THEY MIGHT MURDER US AT THEIR EASE HOLD YOUR TONGUE YOU FOUL MOUTHED THIEF YOU YOU SHALL GO TO THE GALLOWS FOR THIS MISTER LINTON SIR DON'T LAY BY YOUR GUN NO NO ROBERT SAID THE OLD FOOL THE RASCALS KNEW THAT YESTERDAY WAS MY RENT DAY
1200-135043-0032 THEY THOUGHT TO HAVE ME CLEVERLY COME IN I'LL FURNISH THEM A RECEPTION THERE JOHN FASTEN THE CHAIN GIVE SKULKER SOME WATER JENNY TO BEARD A MAGISTRATE IN HIS STRONGHOLD AND ON THE SABBATH TOO WHERE WILL THEIR INSOLENCE STOP OH MY DEAR MARY LOOK HERE
1200-135043-0033 DON'T BE AFRAID IT IS BUT A BOY YET THE VILLAIN SCOWLS SO PLAINLY IN HIS FACE
1200-135043-0034 HE'S EXACTLY LIKE THE SON OF THE FORTUNE TELLER THAT STOLE MY TAME PHEASANT ISN'T HE EDGAR WHILE THEY EXAMINED ME CATHY CAME ROUND SHE HEARD THE LAST SPEECH AND LAUGHED
1200-135043-0035 COLLECTED SUFFICIENT WIT TO RECOGNISE HER THEY SEE US AT CHURCH YOU KNOW THOUGH WE SELDOM MEET THEM ELSEWHERE THAT'S MISS EARNSHAW HE WHISPERED TO HIS MOTHER AND LOOK HOW SKULKER HAS BITTEN HER HOW HER FOOT BLEEDS MISS EARNSHAW
1200-135043-0036 NONSENSE CRIED THE DAME MISS EARNSHAW SCOURING THE COUNTRY WITH A GIPSY AND YET MY DEAR THE CHILD IS IN MOURNING SURELY IT IS AND SHE MAY BE LAMED FOR LIFE WHAT CULPABLE CARELESSNESS IN HER BROTHER
1200-135043-0037 EXCLAIMED MISTER LINTON TURNING FROM ME TO CATHERINE I'VE UNDERSTOOD FROM SHIELDERS THAT WAS THE CURATE SIR THAT HE LETS HER GROW UP IN ABSOLUTE HEATHENISM BUT WHO IS THIS WHERE DID SHE PICK UP THIS COMPANION OHO
1200-135043-0038 A LITTLE LASCAR OR AN AMERICAN OR SPANISH CASTAWAY A WICKED BOY AT ALL EVENTS REMARKED THE OLD LADY AND QUITE UNFIT FOR A DECENT HOUSE DID YOU NOTICE HIS LANGUAGE LINTON
1200-135043-0039 I RECOMMENCED CURSING DON'T BE ANGRY NELLY AND SO ROBERT WAS ORDERED TO TAKE ME OFF I REFUSED TO GO WITHOUT CATHY HE DRAGGED ME INTO THE GARDEN PUSHED THE LANTERN INTO MY HAND ASSURED ME THAT MISTER EARNSHAW SHOULD BE INFORMED OF MY BEHAVIOUR
1200-135043-0040 AND BIDDING ME MARCH DIRECTLY SECURED THE DOOR AGAIN
1200-135043-0041 AND I RESUMED MY STATION AS SPY
1200-135043-0042 I INTENDED SHATTERING THEIR GREAT GLASS PANES TO A MILLION OF FRAGMENTS UNLESS THEY LET HER OUT SHE SAT ON THE SOFA QUIETLY MISSUS LINTON TOOK OFF THE GREY CLOAK OF THE DAIRY MAID WHICH WE HAD BORROWED FOR OUR EXCURSION
1200-135043-0043 SHAKING HER HEAD AND EXPOSTULATING WITH HER I SUPPOSE SHE WAS A YOUNG LADY AND THEY MADE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN HER TREATMENT AND MINE THEN THE WOMAN SERVANT BROUGHT A BASIN OF WARM WATER AND WASHED HER FEET AND MISTER LINTON MIXED A TUMBLER OF NEGUS
1200-135043-0044 AND ISABELLA EMPTIED A PLATEFUL OF CAKES INTO HER LAP AND EDGAR STOOD GAPING AT A DISTANCE AFTERWARDS THEY DRIED AND COMBED HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR
1200-135043-0045 AND WHEELED HER TO THE FIRE AND I LEFT HER AS MERRY AS SHE COULD BE DIVIDING HER FOOD BETWEEN THE LITTLE DOG AND SKULKER WHOSE NOSE SHE PINCHED AS HE ATE AND KINDLING A SPARK OF SPIRIT IN THE VACANT BLUE EYES OF THE LINTONS A DIM REFLECTION FROM HER OWN ENCHANTING FACE
