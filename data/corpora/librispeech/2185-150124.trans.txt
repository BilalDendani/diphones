2185-150124-0000 THE TWO FRIENDS KEPT THE SECRET OF THE EYRY TO THEMSELVES FOR A LITTLE WHILE NOW AND THEN VISITING THE OLD TOWER TO RUMMAGE AMONG THE LUMBER STORED IN THE LOWER ROOM OR TO LOITER AWAY THE AFTERNOON IN THE WINDY SOLITUDES OF THE UPPER HEIGHTS AND IN THAT LITTLE TIME
2185-150124-0001 WHEN THE ANCIENT KEEP WAS TO THEM A SMALL WORLD UNKNOWN TO ANY BUT THEMSELVES A WORLD FAR AWAY ABOVE ALL THE DULL MATTERS OF EVERY DAY LIFE THEY TALKED OF MANY THINGS THAT MIGHT ELSE NEVER HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO ONE ANOTHER
2185-150124-0002 MOSTLY THEY SPOKE THE CRUDE ROMANTIC THOUGHTS AND DESIRES OF BOYHOOD'S TIME CHAFF THROWN TO THE WIND IN WHICH HOWEVER LAY A FEW STRAY SEEDS FATED TO FALL TO GOOD EARTH AND TO RIPEN TO FRUITION IN MANHOOD'S DAY
2185-150124-0003 IN THE INTIMATE TALKS OF THAT TIME MYLES IMPARTED SOMETHING OF HIS HONEST SOLIDITY TO GASCOYNE'S SOMEWHAT WEATHERCOCK NATURE AND TO MYLES'S RUDER AND MORE UNCOUTH CHARACTER GASCOYNE LENT A TONE OF HIS GENTLER MANNERS
2185-150124-0004 LEARNED IN HIS PAGEHOOD SERVICE AS ATTENDANT UPON THE COUNTESS AND HER LADIES IN OTHER THINGS ALSO THE CHARACTER AND EXPERIENCE OF THE ONE LAD HELPED TO SUPPLY WHAT WAS LACKING IN THE OTHER
2185-150124-0005 PICKED UP DURING HIS SCHOOL LIFE IN THOSE INTERVALS OF HIS MORE SERIOUS STUDIES WHEN PRIOR EDWARD HAD PERMITTED HIM TO BROWSE IN THE GREENER PASTURES OF THE GESTA ROMANORUM AND THE DISCIPLINA CLERICALIS OF THE MONASTERY LIBRARY
2185-150124-0006 AND GASCOYNE WAS NEVER WEARY OF HEARING HIM TELL THOSE MARVELLOUS STORIES CULLED FROM THE CRABBED LATIN OF THE OLD MANUSCRIPT VOLUMES UPON HIS PART GASCOYNE WAS FULL OF THE LORE OF THE WAITING ROOM AND THE ANTECHAMBER AND MYLES
2185-150124-0007 WHO IN ALL HIS LIFE HAD NEVER KNOWN A LADY YOUNG OR OLD EXCEPTING HIS MOTHER WAS NEVER TIRED OF LYING SILENTLY LISTENING TO GASCOYNE'S CHATTER OF THE GAY DOINGS OF THE CASTLE GENTLE LIFE IN WHICH HE HAD TAKEN PART SO OFTEN IN THE MERRY DAYS OF HIS PAGEHOOD
2185-150124-0008 I DO WONDER SAID MYLES QUAINTLY THAT THOU COULDST EVER FIND THE COURAGE TO BESPEAK A YOUNG MAID FRANCIS NEVER DID I DO SO NOR EVER COULD RATHER WOULD I FACE THREE STRONG MEN THAN ONE YOUNG DAMSEL
2185-150124-0009 WHEREUPON GASCOYNE BURST OUT LAUGHING MARRY QUOTH HE THEY BE NO SUCH TERRIBLE THINGS BUT GENTLE AND PLEASANT SPOKEN AND SOFT AND SMOOTH AS ANY CAT NO MATTER FOR THAT SAID MYLES
2185-150124-0010 I WOULD NOT FACE ONE SUCH FOR WORLDS IT WAS DURING THE SHORT TIME WHEN SO TO SPEAK THE TWO OWNED THE SOLITUDE OF THE BRUTUS TOWER THAT MYLES TOLD HIS FRIEND OF HIS FATHER'S OUTLAWRY AND OF THE PERIL IN WHICH THE FAMILY STOOD
2185-150124-0011 AND THUS IT WAS I DO MARVEL SAID GASCOYNE ONE DAY AS THE TWO LAY STRETCHED IN THE EYRY LOOKING DOWN INTO THE CASTLE COURT YARD BELOW I DO MARVEL NOW THAT THOU ART STABLISHED HERE THIS MONTH AND MORE
2185-150124-0012 CANST THOU RIDDLE ME WHY IT IS SO MYLES THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY SORE ONE WITH MYLES UNTIL SIR JAMES HAD TOLD HIM OF THE MATTER IN HIS OFFICE THAT DAY
2185-150124-0013 HE HAD ACCEPTED THE CHANGE FROM THEIR EARLIER STATE AND THE BALD POVERTY OF THEIR LIFE AT CROSBEY HOLT WITH THE EASY CARELESSNESS OF BOYHOOD
2185-150124-0014 HIS WAS A BROODING NATURE AND IN THE THREE OR FOUR WEEKS THAT PASSED HE HAD MEDITATED SO MUCH OVER WHAT HAD BEEN TOLD HIM THAT BY AND BY IT ALMOST SEEMED AS IF A SHADOW OF SHAME RESTED UPON HIS FATHER'S FAIR FAME
2185-150124-0015 EVEN THOUGH THE ATTAINT SET UPON HIM WAS UNRIGHTEOUS AND UNJUST AS MYLES KNEW IT MUST BE HE HAD FELT ANGRY AND RESENTFUL AT THE EARL'S NEGLECT AND AS DAYS PASSED AND HE WAS NOT NOTICED IN ANY WAY HIS HEART WAS AT TIMES VERY BITTER
2185-150124-0016 SO NOW GASCOYNE'S INNOCENT QUESTION TOUCHED A SORE SPOT AND MYLES SPOKE WITH A SHARP ANGRY PAIN IN HIS VOICE THAT MADE THE OTHER LOOK QUICKLY UP
2185-150124-0017 SOONER WOULD MY LORD HAVE YONDER SWINEHERD SERVE HIM IN THE HOUSEHOLD THAN ME SAID HE WHY MAY THAT BE MYLES SAID GASCOYNE BECAUSE ANSWERED MYLES WITH THE SAME ANGRY BITTERNESS IN HIS VOICE
2185-150124-0018 EITHER THE EARL IS A COWARD THAT FEARETH TO BEFRIEND ME OR ELSE HE IS A CAITIFF ASHAMED OF HIS OWN FLESH AND BLOOD AND OF ME THE SON OF HIS ONE TIME COMRADE GASCOYNE RAISED HIMSELF UPON HIS ELBOW AND OPENED HIS EYES WIDE IN WONDER
2185-150124-0019 WHY SHOULD HE BE AFEARED TO BEFRIEND THEE WHO ART THOU THAT THE EARL SHOULD FEAR THEE MYLES HESITATED FOR A MOMENT OR TWO WISDOM BADE HIM REMAIN SILENT UPON THE DANGEROUS TOPIC
2185-150124-0020 BUT HIS HEART YEARNED FOR SYMPATHY AND COMPANIONSHIP IN HIS TROUBLE I WILL TELL THEE SAID HE SUDDENLY AND THEREWITH POURED OUT ALL OF THE STORY SO FAR AS HE KNEW IT TO HIS LISTENING WONDERING FRIEND
2185-150124-0021 AND HIS HEART FELT LIGHTER TO BE THUS EASED OF ITS BURDEN AND NOW SAID HE AS HE CONCLUDED IS NOT THIS EARL A MEAN HEARTED CAITIFF TO LEAVE ME THE SON OF HIS ONE TIME FRIEND AND KINSMAN
2185-150124-0022 AND IN A STRANGE PLACE WITHOUT ONCE STRETCHING ME A HELPING HAND HE WAITED AND GASCOYNE KNEW THAT HE EXPECTED AN ANSWER I KNOW NOT THAT HE IS A MEAN HEARTED CAITIFF MYLES SAID HE AT LAST HESITATINGLY
2185-150124-0023 THE EARL HATH MANY ENEMIES AND I HAVE HEARD THAT HE HATH STOOD MORE THAN ONCE IN PERIL HAVING BEEN ACCUSED OF DEALINGS WITH THE KING'S FOES HE WAS COUSIN TO THE EARL OF KENT
2185-150124-0024 THERE BE MORE REASONS THAN THOU WOTTEST OF WHY HE SHOULD NOT HAVE DEALINGS WITH THY FATHER I HAD NOT THOUGHT SAID MYLES BITTERLY AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE THAT THOU WOULDST STAND UP FOR HIM AND AGAINST ME IN THIS QUARREL GASCOYNE
2185-150124-0025 HIM WILL I NEVER FORGIVE SO LONG AS I MAY LIVE AND I HAD THOUGHT THAT THOU WOULDST HAVE STOOD BY ME
2185-150124-0026 AND DO LOVE THEE MORE THAN ANY ONE IN ALL THE WORLD MYLES
2185-150124-0027 TO THINK THAT THE EARL WAS NOT AGAINST THEE AND INDEED FROM ALL THOU HAS TOLD ME I DO SOOTHLY THINK THAT HE AND SIR JAMES MEAN TO BEFRIEND THEE AND HOLD THEE PRIVILY IN KIND REGARD THEN WHY DOTH HE NOT STAND FORTH LIKE A MAN
2185-150124-0028 AND BEFRIEND ME AND MY FATHER OPENLY EVEN IF IT BE TO HIS OWN PERIL SAID MYLES REVERTING STUBBORNLY TO WHAT HE HAD FIRST SPOKEN GASCOYNE DID NOT ANSWER BUT LAY FOR A LONG WHILE IN SILENCE
2185-150124-0029 KNOWEST THOU HE SUDDENLY ASKED AFTER A WHILE WHO IS THIS GREAT ENEMY OF WHOM SIR JAMES SPEAKETH AND WHO SEEKETH SO TO DRIVE THY FATHER TO RUIN NAY SAID MYLES I KNOW NOT
2185-150124-0030 FOR MY FATHER HATH NEVER SPOKEN OF THESE THINGS AND SIR JAMES WOULD NOT TELL ME BUT THIS I KNOW SAID HE SUDDENLY GRINDING HIS TEETH TOGETHER AN I DO NOT HUNT HIM OUT SOME DAY AND SLAY HIM LIKE A DOG HE STOPPED ABRUPTLY
2185-150124-0031 AND GASCOYNE LOOKING ASKANCE AT HIM SAW THAT HIS EYES WERE FULL OF TEARS WHEREUPON HE TURNED HIS LOOKS AWAY AGAIN QUICKLY AND FELL TO SHOOTING PEBBLES OUT THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW WITH HIS FINGER AND THUMB
2185-150124-0032 SAID MYLES AFTER A WHILE NOT I SAID GASCOYNE
2185-150124-0033 NAY SAID MYLES BRIEFLY PERHAPS THIS TALK MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE THAT HAD EVER PASSED BETWEEN THEM
2185-150124-0034 FOR AS I HAVE SAID MYLES FELT EASIER NOW THAT HE HAD POURED OUT HIS BITTER THOUGHTS AND WORDS AND AS FOR GASCOYNE
2185-150124-0035 BUT THE OLD TOWER SERVED ANOTHER PURPOSE THAN THAT OF A SPOT IN WHICH TO PASS AWAY A FEW IDLE HOURS OR IN WHICH TO INDULGE THE CONFIDENCES OF FRIENDSHIP FOR IT WAS THERE THAT MYLES GATHERED A BACKING OF STRENGTH FOR RESISTANCE AGAINST THE TYRANNY OF THE BACHELORS
2185-150124-0036 THAT IT HAS BEEN TOLD HOW THEY FOUND THE PLACE AND OF WHAT THEY DID THERE FEELING SECURE AGAINST INTERRUPTION MYLES FALWORTH WAS NOT OF A KIND THAT FORGETS OR NEGLECTS A THING UPON WHICH THE MIND HAS ONCE BEEN SET PERHAPS HIS CHIEF OBJECTIVE
2185-150124-0037 SINCE THE TALK WITH SIR JAMES FOLLOWING HIS FIGHT IN THE DORMITORY HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL RESISTANCE TO THE EXACTIONS OF THE HEAD OF THE BODY OF SQUIRES HE WAS NOW MORE THAN A MONTH HAD PASSED
2185-150124-0038 SO ONE DAY HE BROACHED A MATTER TO GASCOYNE THAT HAD FOR SOME TIME BEEN DIGESTING IN HIS MIND IT WAS THE FORMATION OF A SECRET ORDER CALLING THEMSELVES THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROSE THEIR MEETING PLACE TO BE THE CHAPEL OF THE BRUTUS TOWER
2185-150124-0039 AND THEIR OBJECT TO BE THE RIGHTING OF WRONGS AS THEY SAID MYLES OF ARTHUR HIS ROUND TABLE DID RIGHT WRONGS BUT PRITHEE WHAT WRONGS ARE THERE TO RIGHT IN THIS PLACE QUOTH GASCOYNE
2185-150124-0040 AFTER LISTENING INTENTLY TO THE PLAN WHICH MYLES SET FORTH WHY FIRST OF ALL THIS SAID MYLES CLINCHING HIS FISTS AS HE HAD A HABIT OF DOING WHEN ANYTHING STIRRED HIM DEEPLY THAT WE SET THOSE VILE BACHELORS TO THEIR RIGHT PLACE
2185-150124-0041 AND THAT IS THAT THEY BE NO LONGER OUR MASTERS BUT OUR FELLOWS GASCOYNE SHOOK HIS HEAD HE HATED CLASHING AND CONFLICT ABOVE ALL THINGS AND WAS FOR PEACE WHY SHOULD THEY THUS RUSH TO THRUST THEMSELVES INTO TROUBLE
2185-150124-0042 LET MATTERS ABIDE AS THEY WERE A LITTLE LONGER SURELY LIFE WAS PLEASANT ENOUGH WITHOUT TURNING IT ALL TOPSY TURVY THEN WITH A SORT OF INDIGNATION WHY SHOULD MYLES WHO HAD ONLY COME AMONG THEM A MONTH
2185-150124-0043 TAKE SUCH SERVICE MORE TO HEART THAN THEY WHO HAD ENDURED IT FOR YEARS AND FINALLY WITH THE HOPEFULNESS OF SO MANY OF THE REST OF US HE ADVISED MYLES TO LET MATTERS ALONE AND THEY WOULD RIGHT THEMSELVES IN TIME
2185-150124-0044 BUT MYLES'S MIND WAS DETERMINED HIS ACTIVE SPIRIT COULD NOT BROOK RESTING PASSIVELY UNDER A WRONG HE WOULD ENDURE NO LONGER
2185-150124-0045 BUT LOOK THEE MYLES FALWORTH SAID GASCOYNE ALL THIS IS NOT TO BE DONE WITHOUTEN FIGHTING SHREWDLY WILT THOU TAKE THAT FIGHTING UPON THINE OWN SELF AS FOR ME I TELL THEE I LOVE IT NOT
2185-150124-0046 WHY AYE SAID MYLES I ASK NO MAN TO DO WHAT I WILL NOT DO MYSELF GASCOYNE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS SO BE IT SAID HE AN THOU HAST APPETITE TO RUN THY HEAD AGAINST HARD KNOCKS
2185-150124-0047 DO IT MERCY'S NAME I FOR ONE WILL STAND THEE BACK WHILE THOU ART TAKING THY RAPS THERE WAS A SPIRIT OF DROLLERY IN GASCOYNE'S SPEECH THAT RUBBED AGAINST MYLES'S EARNESTNESS OUT UPON IT CRIED HE
2185-150124-0048 HIS PATIENCE GIVING WAY SEEST NOT THAT I AM IN SERIOUS EARNEST WHY THEN DOST THOU STILL JEST LIKE MAD NOLL MY LORD'S FOOL AN THOU WILT NOT LEND ME THINE AID IN THIS MATTER SAY SO AND HA DONE WITH IT
2185-150124-0049 AND I WILL BETHINK ME OF SOMEWHERE ELSE TO TURN THEN GASCOYNE YIELDED AT ONCE
2185-150124-0050 AND HAVING ONCE ASSENTED TO IT ENTERED INTO THE SCHEME HEART AND SOUL THREE OTHER LADS ONE OF THEM THAT TALL THIN SQUIRE EDMUND WILKES BEFORE SPOKEN OF WERE SOUNDED UPON THE SUBJECT THEY ALSO ENTERED INTO THE PLAN OF THE SECRET ORGANIZATION
2185-150124-0051 WITH AN ENTHUSIASM WHICH MIGHT PERHAPS NOT HAVE BEEN QUITE SO GLOWING HAD THEY REALIZED HOW VERY SOON MYLES DESIGNED EMBARKING UPON ACTIVE PRACTICAL OPERATIONS ONE DAY MYLES AND GASCOYNE SHOWED THEM THE STRANGE THINGS THAT THEY HAD DISCOVERED IN THE OLD TOWER
2185-150124-0052 THE INNER STAIRCASES THE WINDING PASSAGE WAYS THE QUEER NICHES AND CUPBOARD AND THE BLACK SHAFT OF A WELL THAT PIERCED DOWN INTO THE SOLID WALL AND WHENCE PERHAPS THE OLD CASTLE FOLK HAD ONE TIME DRAWN THEIR SUPPLY OF WATER IN TIME OF SIEGE
2185-150124-0053 AND WITH EVERY NEW WONDER OF THE MARVELLOUS PLACE THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE THREE RECRUITS ROSE HIGHER AND HIGHER THEY RUMMAGED THROUGH THE LUMBER PILE IN THE GREAT CIRCULAR ROOM AS MYLES AND GASCOYNE HAD DONE AND AT LAST TIRED OUT THEY ASCENDED TO THE AIRY CHAPEL
2185-150124-0054 THAT CAME BLOWING BRISKLY IN THROUGH THE ARCHED WINDOWS IT WAS THEN AND THERE THAT THE FIVE DISCUSSED AND FINALLY DETERMINED UPON THE DETAILED PLANS OF THEIR ORGANIZATION CANVASSING THE NAMES OF THE SQUIREHOOD AND SELECTING FROM IT A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF BOLD AND DARING SPIRITS
2185-150124-0055 TO MAKE UP A ROLL OF TWENTY NAMES IN ALL GASCOYNE HAD AS I SAID ENTERED INTO THE MATTER WITH SPIRIT AND PERHAPS IT WAS OWING MORE TO HIM THAN TO ANY OTHER THAT THE PROJECT CAUGHT ITS DELIGHTFUL FLAVOR OF ROMANCE PERCHANCE SAID HE
2185-150124-0056 AS THE FIVE LADS LAY IN THE RUSTLING STILLNESS THROUGH WHICH SOUNDED THE MONOTONOUS AND CEASELESS COOING OF THE PIGEONS PERCHANCE THERE MAY BE DWARFS AND GIANTS AND DRAGONS AND ENCHANTERS AND EVIL KNIGHTS AND WHAT NOT EVEN NOWADAYS
2185-150124-0057 WE MAY GO FORTH INTO THE WORLD AND DO BATTLE WITH THEM AND SAVE BEAUTIFUL LADIES AND HAVE TALES AND GESTES WRITTEN ABOUT US AS THEY ARE WRIT ABOUT THE SEVEN CHAMPIONS AND ARTHUR HIS ROUND TABLE PERHAPS MYLES WHO LAY SILENTLY LISTENING TO ALL THAT WAS SAID
2185-150124-0058 WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO LOOKED UPON THE SCHEME AT ALL IN THE LIGHT OF REAL UTILITY BUT I THINK THAT EVEN WITH HIM THE FUN OF THE MATTER OUTWEIGHED THE SERIOUS PART OF THE BUSINESS SO IT WAS THAT THE SACRED ORDER OF THE TWENTY KNIGHTS OF THE ROSE CAME TO BE INITIATED
2185-150124-0059 THEY APPOINTED A CODE OF SECRET PASSWORDS AND COUNTERSIGNS WHICH WERE VERY DIFFICULT TO REMEMBER AND WHICH WERE ONLY USED WHEN THEY MIGHT EXCITE THE CURIOSITY OF THE OTHER AND UNINITIATED BOYS BY THEIR MYSTERIOUS SOUND
2185-150124-0060 THEY ELECTED MYLES AS THEIR GRAND HIGH COMMANDER AND HELD SECRET MEETINGS IN THE ANCIENT TOWER WHERE MANY MYSTERIES WERE SOBERLY ENACTED OF COURSE IN A DAY OR TWO ALL THE BODY OF SQUIRES KNEW NEARLY EVERYTHING CONCERNING THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROSE
2185-150124-0061 AND OF THEIR SECRET MEETINGS IN THE OLD TOWER THE LUCKY TWENTY WERE THE OBJECTS OF ENVY OF ALL NOT SO FORTUNATE AS TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS NUMBER AND THERE WAS A MARKED AIR OF SECRECY ABOUT EVERYTHING THEY DID THAT APPEALED TO EVERY ROMANTIC NOTION OF THE YOUNGSTERS LOOKING ON
