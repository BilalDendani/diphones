7769-99396-0000 I HAD BUT A KNIFE AND A PIPE IT NOW GREW DARK
7769-99396-0001 I THOUGHT THE TOP OF SOME HIGH TREE WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO KEEP ME OUT OF HARM'S WAY AND THAT THERE I MIGHT SIT AND THINK OF DEATH FOR AS YET I HAD NO HOPES OF LIFE
7769-99396-0002 THEN I CUT A STICK TO KEEP OFF THE BEASTS OF PREY IN CASE THEY SHOULD COME AND FELL TO SLEEP JUST AS IF THE BRANCH I LAY ON HAD BEEN A BED OF DOWN WHEN I WOKE UP IT WAS BROAD DAY
7769-99396-0003 THE SKY TOO WAS CLEAR AND THE SEA CALM
7769-99396-0004 AND LAY BUT A MILE FROM ME WHILE THE BOAT WAS ON THE BEACH TWO MILES ON MY RIGHT I WENT SOME WAY DOWN BY THE SHORE TO GET TO THE BOAT
7769-99396-0005 SO THAT I COULD GET NEAR THE SHIP AND HERE I FOUND
7769-99396-0006 WE SHOULD ALL HAVE BEEN SAFE
7769-99396-0007 YET AS THERE WAS NO USE IN THAT IT STRUCK ME THAT THE BEST THING FOR ME TO DO WAS TO SWIM TO THE SHIP I SOON THREW OFF MY CLOTHES TOOK TO THE SEA AND SWAM UP TO THE WRECK
7769-99396-0008 BUT HOW WAS I TO GET ON DECK I HAD SWAM TWICE ROUND THE SHIP WHEN A PIECE OF ROPE CAUGHT MY EYE
7769-99396-0009 THAT AT FIRST THE WAVES HID IT BY THE HELP OF THIS ROPE I GOT ON BOARD I FOUND THAT THERE WAS A BULGE IN THE SHIP AND THAT SHE HAD SPRUNG A LEAK
7769-99396-0010 YOU MAY BE SURE THAT MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO LOOK ROUND FOR SOME FOOD AND I SOON MADE MY WAY TO THE BIN WHERE THE BREAD WAS KEPT AND ATE SOME OF IT AS I WENT TO AND FRO FOR THERE WAS NO TIME TO LOSE
7769-99396-0011 THERE WAS TOO SOME RUM OF WHICH I TOOK A GOOD DRAUGHT AND THIS GAVE ME HEART WHAT I STOOD MOST IN NEED OF WAS A BOAT TO TAKE THE GOODS TO SHORE
7769-99396-0012 AND AS THERE WERE SOME SPARE YARDS IN THE SHIP TWO OR THREE LARGE PLANKS OF WOOD AND A SPARE MAST OR TWO I FELL TO WORK WITH THESE TO MAKE A RAFT I PUT FOUR SPARS SIDE BY SIDE
7769-99396-0013 AND LAID SHORT BITS OF PLANK ON THEM CROSS WAYS TO MAKE MY RAFT STRONG THOUGH THESE PLANKS WOULD BEAR MY OWN WEIGHT THEY WERE TOO SLIGHT TO BEAR MUCH OF MY FREIGHT SO
7769-99396-0014 WHICH WAS ON BOARD AND CUT A MAST IN THREE LENGTHS AND THESE GAVE GREAT STRENGTH TO THE RAFT I FOUND SOME BREAD AND RICE A DUTCH CHEESE AND SOME DRY GOAT'S FLESH THERE HAD BEEN SOME WHEAT
7769-99396-0015 BUT THE RATS HAD GOT AT IT AND IT WAS ALL GONE MY NEXT TASK WAS TO SCREEN MY GOODS FROM THE SPRAY OF THE SEA
7769-99396-0016 AND THESE I PUT ON THE RAFT WHEN THE HIGH TIDE CAME UP IT TOOK OFF MY COAT AND SHIRT WHICH I HAD LEFT ON THE SHORE BUT THERE WERE SOME FRESH CLOTHES IN THE SHIP
7769-99396-0017 SEE HERE IS A PRIZE SAID I OUT LOUD
7769-99396-0018 NOW I SHALL NOT STARVE FOR I FOUND FOUR LARGE GUNS BUT HOW WAS MY RAFT TO BE GOT TO LAND I HAD NO SAIL NO OARS
7769-99396-0019 AND A GUST OF WIND WOULD MAKE ALL MY STORE SLIDE OFF
7769-99396-0020 A CALM SEA A TIDE WHICH SET IN TO THE SHORE AND A SLIGHT BREEZE TO BLOW ME THERE I HAD THE GOOD LUCK TO FIND SOME OARS IN A PART OF THE SHIP IN WHICH I HAD MADE NO SEARCH TILL NOW
7769-99396-0021 BUT SOON I FOUND IT DROVE TO ONE SIDE AT LENGTH I SAW A CREEK TO WHICH WITH SOME TOIL I TOOK MY RAFT AND NOW THE BEACH WAS SO NEAR THAT I FELT MY OAR TOUCH THE GROUND
7769-99396-0022 HERE I HAD WELL NIGH LOST MY FREIGHT FOR THE SHORE LAY ON A SLOPE SO THAT THERE WAS NO PLACE TO LAND ON SAVE WHERE ONE END OF THE RAFT WOULD LIE SO HIGH AND ONE END SO LOW
7769-99396-0023 THAT ALL MY GOODS WOULD FALL OFF TO WAIT TILL THE TIDE CAME UP WAS ALL THAT COULD BE DONE SO WHEN THE SEA WAS A FOOT DEEP I THRUST THE RAFT
7769-99396-0024 AND STUCK MY TWO OARS IN THE SAND ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE RAFT THUS I LET HER LIE TILL THE EBB OF THE TIDE AND WHEN IT WENT DOWN SHE WAS LEFT SAFE ON LAND WITH ALL HER FREIGHT
7769-99396-0025 I SAW THAT THERE WERE BIRDS ON THE ISLE AND I SHOT ONE OF THEM MINE MUST HAVE BEEN THE FIRST GUN THAT HAD BEEN HEARD THERE SINCE THE WORLD WAS MADE FOR AT THE SOUND OF IT
7769-99396-0026 WHOLE FLOCKS OF BIRDS FLEW UP WITH LOUD CRIES FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WOOD
7769-99396-0027 AND THIS TOOK UP THE REST OF THE DAY WHAT TO DO AT NIGHT I KNEW NOT
7769-99396-0028 FOR FEAR OF BEASTS OF PREY AS WELL AS SNAKES BUT THERE WAS NO CAUSE FOR THESE FEARS AS I HAVE SINCE FOUND I PUT THE CHESTS AND BOARDS ROUND ME AS WELL AS I COULD
7769-99396-0029 AND MADE A KIND OF HUT FOR THE NIGHT AS THERE WAS STILL A GREAT STORE OF THINGS LEFT IN THE SHIP WHICH WOULD BE OF USE TO ME
7769-99396-0030 FOR I KNEW THAT THE FIRST STORM WOULD BREAK UP THE SHIP
7769-99396-0031 AND TOOK GOOD CARE THIS TIME NOT TO LOAD MY RAFT TOO MUCH THE FIRST THING I SOUGHT FOR WAS THE TOOL CHEST AND IN IT WERE SOME BAGS OF NAILS SPIKES SAWS
7769-99396-0032 AND A ROLL OF LEAD BUT THIS LAST I HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO HOIST UP TO THE SHIP'S SIDE SO AS TO GET IT ON MY RAFT THERE WERE SOME SPARE SAILS TOO WHICH I BROUGHT TO SHORE
7769-99396-0033 WHICH SAT ON ONE OF THE CHESTS WHEN I CAME UP I HELD MY GUN AT HER BUT AS SHE DID NOT KNOW
7769-99396-0034 NOW THAT I HAD TWO FREIGHTS OF GOODS AT HAND I MADE A TENT WITH THE SHIP'S SAILS TO STOW THEM IN AND CUT THE POLES FOR IT FROM THE WOOD
7769-99396-0035 AND PUT THE CASKS IN PILES ROUND THE TENT
7769-99396-0036 SPREAD ONE OF THE BEDS WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM THE SHIP ON THE GROUND LAID TWO GUNS CLOSE TO MY HEAD AND WENT TO BED FOR THE FIRST TIME I SLEPT ALL NIGHT FOR I WAS MUCH IN NEED OF REST
7769-99396-0037 THE NEXT DAY I WAS SAD AND SICK AT HEART
7769-99396-0038 BUT THERE WAS TOO MUCH TO BE DONE FOR ME TO DWELL LONG ON MY SAD LOT
7769-99396-0039 AND I BROUGHT BACK AS MUCH AS THE RAFT WOULD HOLD ONE DAY I HAD PUT TOO GREAT A LOAD ON THE RAFT WHICH MADE IT SINK DOWN ON ONE SIDE SO THAT THE GOODS WERE LOST IN THE SEA
7769-99396-0040 WERE SPENT IN THIS WAY AND I HAD BROUGHT TO LAND ALL THAT ONE PAIR OF HANDS COULD LIFT THOUGH IF THE SEA HAD BEEN STILL CALM I MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT THE WHOLE SHIP PIECE BY PIECE THE LAST TIME
7769-99396-0041 I SWAM TO THE WRECK THE WIND BLEW SO HARD THAT I MADE UP MY MIND TO GO ON BOARD NEXT TIME AT LOW TIDE I FOUND SOME TEA AND SOME GOLD COIN BUT AS TO THE GOLD IT MADE ME LAUGH TO LOOK AT IT
7769-99396-0042 O DRUG SAID I THOU ART OF NO USE TO ME
7769-99396-0043 TILL THE SHIP GO DOWN THEN GO THOU WITH IT
7769-99396-0044 SO I PUT IT IN A PIECE OF THE SAIL
7769-99396-0045 SO I HAD TO SWIM BACK WITH ALL SPEED FOR I KNEW THAT AT THE TURN OF THE TIDE I SHOULD FIND IT HARD WORK TO GET TO LAND AT ALL BUT IN SPITE OF THE HIGH WIND I CAME TO MY HOME ALL SAFE
7769-99396-0046 AT DAWN OF DAY I PUT MY HEAD OUT AND CAST MY EYES ON THE SEA WHEN LO NO SHIP WAS THERE
7769-99396-0047 I HAD NOW TO LOOK OUT FOR SOME SPOT WHERE I COULD MAKE MY HOME HALF WAY UP A HILL THERE WAS A SMALL PLAIN FOUR OR FIVE SCORE FEET LONG AND TWICE AS BROAD AND
7769-99396-0048 AS IT HAD A FULL VIEW OF THE SEA I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE FOR MY HOUSE I FIRST DUG A TRENCH ROUND A SPACE WHICH TOOK IN TWELVE YARDS AND IN THIS I DROVE
7769-99396-0049 TWO ROWS OF STAKES TILL THEY STOOD FIRM LIKE PILES FIVE AND A HALF FEET FROM THE GROUND I MADE THE STAKES CLOSE AND TIGHT WITH BITS OF ROPE
7769-99396-0050 AND PUT SMALL STICKS ON THE TOP OF THEM IN THE SHAPE OF SPIKES THIS MADE SO STRONG A FENCE THAT NO MAN OR BEAST COULD GET IN THE DOOR OF MY HOUSE WAS ON THE TOP AND I HAD TO CLIMB UP TO IT BY STEPS
7769-99396-0051 WHICH I TOOK IN WITH ME SO THAT NO ONE ELSE MIGHT COME UP BY THE SAME WAY CLOSE TO THE BACK OF THE HOUSE STOOD A HIGH ROCK IN WHICH I MADE A CAVE
7769-99396-0052 ROUND MY HOUSE TO THE HEIGHT OF A FOOT AND A HALF I HAD TO GO OUT ONCE A DAY IN SEARCH OF FOOD
7769-99396-0053 TO LET ME GET NEAR THEM AT LAST I LAY IN WAIT FOR THEM CLOSE TO THEIR OWN HAUNTS
7769-99396-0054 BUT IF THEY WERE IN THE VALE AND I ON HIGH GROUND THEY TOOK NO HEED OF ME THE FIRST GOAT I SHOT HAD A KID BY HER SIDE AND WHEN THE OLD ONE FELL
7769-99396-0055 THE KID STOOD NEAR HER TILL I TOOK HER OFF ON MY BACK AND THEN THE YOUNG ONE RAN BY MY SIDE
