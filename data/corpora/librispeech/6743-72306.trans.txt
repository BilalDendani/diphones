6743-72306-0000 BOARD SCHOOLS HAVE REDUCED US TO THAT OF LEAD AT MARKSLEIGH THE VILLAGERS BELIEVE IN IT AND RECENTLY THEIR FAITH HAS RECEIVED CORROBORATION HOW SO I ASKED LAST YEAR IN A FIT OF BRAVADO
6743-72306-0001 A YOUNG CARPENTER VENTURED TO SIT IN THE PORCH AT THE WITCHING HOUR AND SAW HIMSELF ENTER THE CHURCH HE CAME HOME LOOKING AS BLANK AS A SHEET MOPED LOST FLESH AND DIED NINE MONTHS LATER OF COURSE HE DIED IF HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO DO SO
6743-72306-0002 YES THAT IS EXPLICABLE
6743-72306-0003 HE HAD BEEN DRINKING AT THE PUBLIC HOUSE A GOOD MANY PEOPLE SEE DOUBLE AFTER THAT IT WAS NOT SO HE WAS PERFECTLY SOBER AT THE TIME THEN I GIVE IT UP WOULD YOU VENTURE ON A VISIT TO A CHURCH PORCH
6743-72306-0004 I BAR THE PIPE SAID MISS FULTON NO APPARITION CAN STAND TOBACCO SMOKE BUT THERE IS LADY EASTLEIGH RISING WHEN YOU COME TO REJOIN THE LADIES I SHALL BE GONE I DID NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE OF THE WEATHERWOODS TILL LATE
6743-72306-0005 MY DOGCART WAS DRIVEN BY MY GROOM RICHARD THE NIGHT WAS COLD OR RATHER CHILLY
6743-72306-0006 THE STARS SHONE OUT OF A FROSTY SKY
6743-72306-0007 I CANNOT BLAME DICK IF HE RAN HIS WHEEL OVER A HEAP OF STONES THAT UPSET THE TRAP WE WERE BOTH THROWN OUT AND I FELL ON MY HEAD I SANG OUT MIND THE COB DICK
6743-72306-0008 THE BOY AT ONCE MASTERED THE HORSE
6743-72306-0009 WHEN I DID I FOUND DICK ENGAGED IN MENDING A RUPTURED TRACE ONE OF THE SHAFTS WAS BROKEN AND A CARRIAGE LAMP HAD BEEN SHATTERED DICK SAID I THERE ARE A COUPLE OF STEEP HILLS TO DESCEND AND THAT IS RISKY WITH A SINGLE SHAFT
6743-72306-0010 I WILL LIGHTEN THE DOGCART BY WALKING HOME AND DO YOU TAKE CARE AT THE HILLS I THINK WE CAN MANAGE SIR I SHOULD PREFER TO WALK THE REST OF THE WAY I
6743-72306-0011 AM RATHER SHAKEN BY MY FALL AND A GOOD STEP OUT IN THE COOL NIGHT WILL DO MORE TO PUT ME TO RIGHTS THAN ANYTHING ELSE WHEN YOU GET HOME
6743-72306-0012 IT'S A GOOD TRUDGE BEFORE YOU SIR AND I DARE SAY WE COULD GET THE SHAFT TIED UP AT FIFEWELL WHAT AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT NO DICK DO AS I SAY ACCORDINGLY THE GROOM DROVE OFF AND I STARTED ON MY WALK
6743-72306-0013 I WAS GLAD TO GET OUT OF THE CLINGING FOG WHEN I REACHED HIGHER GROUND I LOOKED BACK AND BY THE STARLIGHT SAW THE RIVER BOTTOM FILLED WITH THE MIST LYING APPARENTLY DENSE AS SNOW AFTER A SWINGING WALK OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR I ENTERED THE OUTSKIRTS OF FIFEWELL
6743-72306-0014 A VILLAGE OF SOME IMPORTANCE WITH SHOPS THE SEAT OF THE PETTY SESSIONS AND WITH A SMALL BOOT AND SHOE FACTORY IN IT THE STREET WAS DESERTED
6743-72306-0015 EVERY DOOR WAS SHUT NO ONE WAS STIRRING AS I PASSED ALONG THE CHURCHYARD WALL THE STORY OF THE YOUNG CARPENTER TOLD BY MISS FULTON RECURRED TO ME
6743-72306-0016 BY JOVE THOUGHT I IT IS NOW CLOSE UPON MIDNIGHT A RARE OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO SEE THE WONDERS OF SAINT MARK'S EVE I WILL GO INTO THE PORCH AND REST THERE FOR A FEW MINUTES
6743-72306-0017 AND THEN I SHALL BE ABLE WHEN I MEET THAT GIRL AGAIN TO TELL HER THAT I HAD DONE WHAT SHE CHALLENGED ME TO DO WITHOUT ANY IDEA THAT I WOULD TAKE HER CHALLENGE UP I TURNED IN AT THE GATE AND WALKED UP THE PATHWAY THE HEADSTONES BORE A SOMEWHAT GHOSTLY LOOK IN THE STARLIGHT
6743-72306-0018 A CROSS OF WHITE STONE RECENTLY SET UP I SUPPOSED HAD ALMOST THE APPEARANCE OF PHOSPHORESCENCE THE CHURCH WINDOWS WERE DARK I SEATED MYSELF IN THE ROOMY PORCH ON A STONE BENCH AGAINST THE WALL AND FELT FOR MY PIPE
6743-72306-0019 BUT ALSO BECAUSE I FELT THAT IT WAS NOT QUITE THE RIGHT THING TO DO ON CONSECRATED GROUND
6743-72306-0020 TO MY VEXATION I FOUND THAT I HAD LOST IT THE TOBACCO POUCH WAS THERE AND THE MATCHES MY PIPE MUST HAVE FALLEN OUT OF MY POCKET WHEN I WAS PITCHED FROM THE TRAP THAT PIPE WAS A FAVOURITE OF MINE WHAT A HOWLING NUISANCE SAID I
6743-72306-0021 IF I SEND DICK BACK OVER THE ROAD TO MORROW MORNING TEN CHANCES TO ONE IF HE FINDS IT FOR TO MORROW IS MARKET DAY AND PEOPLE WILL BE PASSING EARLY AS I SAID THIS THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE I COUNTED EACH STROKE
6743-72306-0022 I WORE MY FUR LINED COAT AND WAS NOT COLD IN FACT I HAD BEEN TOO WARM WALKING IN IT AT THE LAST STROKE OF TWELVE I NOTICED LINES OF VERY BRILLIANT LIGHT APPEAR ABOUT THE DOOR INTO THE CHURCH
6743-72306-0023 THE DOOR MUST HAVE FITTED WELL AS THE LIGHT DID NO MORE THAN SHOW ABOUT IT AND DID NOT GUSH FORTH AT ALL THE CREVICES BUT FROM THE KEYHOLE SHOT A RAY OF INTENSE BRILLIANCY WHETHER THE CHURCH WINDOWS WERE ILLUMINED I DID NOT SEE
6743-72306-0024 IN FACT IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME TO LOOK EITHER THEN OR LATER BUT I AM PRETTY CERTAIN THAT THEY WERE NOT OR THE LIGHT STREAMING FROM THEM WOULD HAVE BROUGHT THE GRAVESTONES INTO PROMINENCE
6743-72306-0025 WHEN YOU COME TO THINK OF IT IT WAS REMARKABLE THAT THE LIGHT OF SO DAZZLING A NATURE SHOULD SHINE THROUGH THE CRANNIES OF THE DOOR AND THAT NONE SHOULD ISSUE AS FAR AS I COULD SEE FROM THE WINDOWS AT THE TIME I DID NOT GIVE THIS A THOUGHT MY ATTENTION WAS OTHERWISE TAKEN UP
6743-72306-0026 FOR I SAW DISTINCTLY MISS VENVILLE A VERY NICE GIRL OF MY ACQUAINTANCE COMING UP THE PATH
6743-72306-0027 AND SOME YOUNG GIRLS HAVE PASSED BY THAT I HAVE SAID TO MY WIFE I BET YOU A BOB THOSE ARE ENGLISH YES OF COURSE SHE HAS REPLIED YOU CAN SEE THAT BY THEIR DRESS I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT DRESS I HAVE SAID I JUDGE BY THE WALK
6743-72306-0028 WELL THERE WAS MISS VENVILLE COMING TOWARDS THE PORCH THIS IS A JOKE SAID I
6743-72306-0029 IF I GAVE A WHIFF IT WOULD REVEAL THE PRESENCE OF A MORTAL WITHOUT ALARMING HER I THINK I SHALL WHISTLE I HAD SCREWED UP MY LIPS TO BEGIN ROCKED IN THE CRADLE OF THE DEEP THAT IS MY GREAT SONG I PERFORM WHENEVER THERE IS A VILLAGE CONCERT
6743-72306-0030 OR I AM ASKED OUT TO DINNER AND AM ENTREATED AFTERWARDS TO SING
6743-72306-0031 WHEN I SAW SOMETHING THAT SCARED ME SO THAT I MADE NO ATTEMPT AT THE MELODY THE RAY OF LIGHT THROUGH THE KEYHOLE WAS SHUT OFF AND I SAW STANDING IN THE PORCH BEFORE ME THE FORM OF MISSUS VENVILLE THE GIRL'S MOTHER WHO HAD DIED TWO YEARS BEFORE
6743-72306-0032 THE RAY OF WHITE LIGHT ARRESTED BY HER FILLED HER AS A LAMP
6743-72306-0033 GWENDOLINE I HAVE COME TO WARN YOU BACK YOU CANNOT ENTER YOU HAVE NOT GOT THE KEY
6743-72306-0034 EVERYONE WHO WOULD PASS WITHIN MUST HAVE HIS OR HER OWN KEY
6743-72306-0035 WHAT GOOD HAVE YOU EVER DONE TO DESERVE IT
6743-72306-0036 AND I ALWAYS DRESSED IN GOOD TASTE NOR IS THAT
6743-72306-0037 THAT WILL NOT DO GWENDOLINE
6743-72306-0038 THE GIRL CONSIDERED A MINUTE THEN LAUGHED AND SAID
6743-72306-0039 AND I DREW OUT A PAIR OF BRACES I HAD RARE FUN OVER THOSE BRACES I SOLD THEM TO CAPTAIN FITZAKERLY FOR HALF A CROWN
6743-72306-0040 AND THE RAY SHOT DIRECTLY AT THE GIRL I SAW THAT IT HAD SOMETHING OF THE QUALITY OF THE X RAY IT WAS NOT ARRESTED BY HER GARMENTS OR HER FLESH OR MUSCLES IT REVEALED IN HER BREAST IN HER BRAIN PENETRATING HER WHOLE BODY
6743-72306-0041 A HARD DARK CORE BLACK RAM I BET SAID I
6743-72306-0042 THE SUBSTANCE LIES SOME TWO OR THREE FEET BELOW THE SURFACE AND FORMS A CRUST OF THE CONSISTENCY OF CAST IRON NO PLOUGH CAN POSSIBLY BE DRIVEN THROUGH IT NO WATER CAN PERCOLATE ATHWART IT AND CONSEQUENTLY WHERE IT IS
6743-72306-0043 THERE THE SUPERINCUMBENT SOIL IS RESOLVED INTO A QUAGMIRE NO TREE CAN GROW IN IT FOR THE MOMENT THE TAPROOT TOUCHES THE BLACK RAM THE TREE DIES OF WHAT BLACK RAM CONSISTS IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY THE POPULAR OPINION IS THAT IT IS A BASTARD MANGANESE
6743-72306-0044 FIELDS THAT OUGHT TO BE LUXURIANT MEADOWS BUT WHICH IN CONSEQUENCE OF ITS PRESENCE
6743-72306-0045 THE BOOK OF THE LIFE OF POLLY FINCH OR RATHER OF GWENDOLINE'S SOUL IN POLLY FINCH'S BODY IT WAS BUT ONE PAGE THAT I SAW AND THE FIGURES IN IT WERE MOVING THE GIRL WAS STRUGGLING UNDER THE BURDEN OF A HEAVY BABY BROTHER
6743-72306-0046 SHE COAXED HIM SHE SANG TO HIM SHE PLAYED WITH HIM TALKED TO HIM BROKE OFF BITS OF HER BREAD AND BUTTER GIVEN TO HER FOR BREAKFAST AND MADE HIM EAT THEM SHE WIPED HIS NOSE AND EYES WITH HER POCKET HANDKERCHIEF SHE TRIED TO DANCE HIM IN HER ARMS HE WAS A FRACTIOUS URCHIN
6743-72306-0047 AND MOST EXACTING BUT HER PATIENCE HER GOOD NATURE NEVER FAILED THE DROPS STOOD ON HER BROW AND HER LIMBS TOTTERED UNDER THE WEIGHT BUT HER HEART WAS STRONG AND HER EYES SHONE WITH LOVE I DREW MY HAND FROM MY HEAD IT WAS BURNING
6743-72306-0048 INSTANTLY IT WAS AS THOUGH ANOTHER PAGE WERE REVEALED I SAW POLLY IN HER WIDOWED FATHER'S COTTAGE SHE WAS NOW A GROWN GIRL SHE WAS ON HER KNEES SCRUBBING THE FLOOR A BELL TINKLED THEN SHE PUT DOWN THE SOAP AND BRUSH TURNED DOWN HER SLEEVES
6743-72306-0049 ROSE AND WENT INTO THE OUTER SHOP TO SERVE A CUSTOMER WITH HALF A POUND OF TEA THAT DONE SHE WAS BACK AGAIN AND THE SCRUBBING WAS RENEWED AGAIN A TINKLE AND AGAIN SHE STOOD UP AND WENT INTO THE SHOP TO A CHILD WHO DESIRED TO BUY A PENNYWORTH OF LEMON DROPS
6743-72306-0050 ON HER RETURN IN CAME HER LITTLE BROTHER CRYING HE HAD CUT HIS FINGER POLLY AT ONCE APPLIED COBWEB AND THEN STITCHED A RAG ABOUT THE WOUNDED MEMBER THERE THERE TOMMY DON'T CRY ANY MORE I HAVE KISSED THE BAD PLACE AND IT WILL SOON BE WELL
