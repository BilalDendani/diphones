5765-87740-0000 IT IS ASTOUNDING TO VIEW THE SMALLEST ARTICLE THROUGH A MAGNIFYING GLASS HOW LARGE AND LUSTROUS AN ATOM OF SILVER APPEARS HOW FAT AND FAIR THE WITHERED FINGER SEEMS
5765-87740-0001 HOW MONSTROUSLY MIGHTY AN ORANGE HOW IMMEASURABLY GREAT THE FOOTBALL OF YOUTH BUT THESE ARE AS NOUGHT WHEN THE NAKED EYE BEHOLDS THE BOULDER OF BARRED STRENGTH A MOUNTAIN OF MYSTERY
5765-87740-0002 THE USUAL HOUR FOR AROUSING THE INMATES OF DUNFERN MANSION WAS DESIGNATED BY THE RINGING OF A BELL CONSTRUCTED AT THE BACK PART OF THE BUILDING AND CONNECTED BY MEANS OF A WIRE WITH THE ROOM OF THE FOOTMAN
5765-87740-0003 WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO RING FULLY THREE MINUTES EVERY MORNING AT THE HOUR OF SEVEN O'CLOCK IN WINTER AND SIX IN SUMMER ON CHRISTMAS MORNING ONLY A SHORT TIME AFTER LADY DUNFERN'S ESCAPE WAS EFFECTED IT RANG SOMEWHAT LATER
5765-87740-0004 AROUSING FROM SLEEP ALL THE SERVANTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MARJORY MASON WHO FAILED ENTIRELY TO PUT IN AN APPEARANCE EVEN WHEN CALLED THRICE BY RACHEL HOWEVER BELIEVING THAT SHE WAS STILL FAST ASLEEP RACHEL CEASED TO FURTHER CALL ON HER
5765-87740-0005 UNTIL AFTER SERVING HER LADYSHIP'S BREAKFAST ON THIS FESTIVE DAY THE BREAKFAST SERVED IN THE SERVANTS SPACIOUS HALL WAS A SUMPTUOUS REPAST TRULY AND REQUIRED LONGER TIME TO PREPARE THAN WAS CUSTOMARY THIS BEING SO
5765-87740-0006 EVIDENTLY DELAYED THE HOUSEKEEPER A CONSIDERABLE TIME IN ATTENDING TO THE WANTS OF HER MISTRESS WHOSE BREAKFAST WAS ALWAYS PUNCTUALLY SERVED AT NINE O'CLOCK THIS RULE WAS VIOLATED TO THE EXTENT OF ABOUT HALF AN HOUR ON THE MEMORABLE MORNING OF LADY DUNFERN'S FLIGHT
5765-87740-0007 SIR JOHN BREAKFASTED AT FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTER NINE AND LOOKED BOTH CAREWORN AND SAD INTIMATING TO RACHEL HIS INABILITY TO SLEEP THE PREVIOUS NIGHT ORDERING HER TO PREPARE A DAINTY DISH FOR LADY DUNFERN
5765-87740-0008 HE PROCEEDED TO READ THE DAILY PAPER THAT HAD BEEN SO CUSTOMARY FOR YEARS RACHEL HASTILY EXECUTING HER MASTER'S ORDERS AND HAVING ALL IN READINESS FOR HER MISTRESS HURRIED TO HER ROOM FOR THE KEY
5765-87740-0009 AS WAS HER CUSTOM BY STRICT ORDERS OF HER MASTER NEVER ALLOWING THE MAID FURTHER THAN THE DOOR DEPOSITING IT UPON THE TABLE SHE SWIFTLY TURNED TO THE DOOR AND LOCKING IT FROM WITHIN BEGAN TO GAZE AROUND FOR LADY DUNFERN WHO SOMETIMES BREAKFASTED IN BED
5765-87740-0010 MOVING IN ITS DIRECTION WITH TRAY IN HAND NO LADY DUNFERN APPEARED THE BED REMAINED UNUSED SINCE SHE SETTLED IT THE PREVIOUS DAY WILDLY SHOUTING WITH MOMENTARY PAIN RACHEL LET FALL THE TRAY SMASHING THE CHINA
5765-87740-0011 IN DEEP DESPAIR SHE CAST ONE DELIRIOUS STARE AROUND THE ROOM BUT ALL TO NO EFFECT HEAVEN HELP ME HAS SHE FLED OH WHAT WHAT SHALL I DO THINKING THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE HIDDEN UNDER THE COUCH OF REST
5765-87740-0012 SHE THREW HERSELF ON THE FLOOR TO TRY AND CATCH ONLY A GLANCE OF HER HIDDEN FORM BUT WAS DISAPPOINTED ONCE MORE RUNNING TO THE DOOR AND FRANTICALLY OPENING IT SHE RAN TO MARJORY'S ROOM FAILING TO BE ADMITTED
5765-87740-0013 SHE HURRIED DOWN TO ACQUAINT SOME OF THE MEN WHO ATTEMPTED TO OPEN MARJORY'S DOOR
5765-87740-0014 WHAT WAS THERE LEFT TO BE DONE SAVE TO ACQUAINT SIR JOHN OF THE MATTER AGITATED DID RACHEL ENTER WITHOUT SIGNIFYING HER APPROACH TO HER MASTER WHO SAT IN SILENCE OH SIR CRIED SHE DROWNED IN TEARS
5765-87740-0015 AND UTTERED IN BROKEN ACCENTS THE WORDS YOUR WIFE HAS ESCAPED SHE IS NOT IN HER ROOM WHAT GASPED SIR JOHN IT CANNOT BE FOLLOWING RACHEL TO THE ROOM OF TERROR HE FOUND HER INFORMATION TOO TRUE
5765-87740-0016 HOW ON EARTH HAS THIS HAPPENED ASKED THE HORRIFIED HUSBAND HAD YOU THE KEY HE FIERCELY ASKED OF RACHEL EVER READY TO SUBSTITUTE THE TRUTH WITH A LIE WHERE THE FORMER ESPECIALLY WOULD CONVICT HER
5765-87740-0017 SHE REPLIED WITH A STAMP OF HER FOOT THAT IT NEVER WAS OUT OF HER DRAWER OF SAFE DEPOSIT THINKING PROBABLY SHE MAY HAVE TRIFLED WITH THE WINDOW SIR JOHN MOVED FORWARD AND THE WRAP NEVER BEING REMOVED HE THOUGHT IT HAD NOT IN ANY WAY BEEN TAMPERED WITH
5765-87740-0018 UNTIL RACHEL ESPIED THE CORNER PANE AH SAID SHE THIS IS THE CLUE TO HER CURSED CRAFT THIS MUST HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH HER ESCAPE THEN THE THOUGHT OF MARJORY'S ROOM BEING STILL CLOSED TO VIEW
5765-87740-0019 SHE FANCIED MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING ALSO TO DO WITH THE MYSTERIOUS AND MARVELLOUS MARK OF INGENIOUS INTRIGUE BOTH SIR JOHN AND RACHEL TOTTERED TO MARJORY'S DOOR AND DEMANDING IT TO BE BROKEN OPEN SIR JOHN ENTERED TO BE FURTHER ASTONISHED AT HER ABSENCE TO BE SURE
5765-87740-0020 ON HER BED SHE CANNOT HAVE LAIN THE PREVIOUS NIGHT WHICH WAS PROOF POSITIVE THAT SHE WAS AN ANNOUNCED ACCOMPLICE BUT THE MYSTERY HAD YET TO BE SOLVED AS TO THE ACTION OF THEIR FLIGHT GUILT TOOK STRONG HOLD ON RACHEL
5765-87740-0021 SHE KNEW THE KEY WAS ALWAYS KEPT IN A DRAWER IN HER OWN ROOM WHICH DRAWER WAS CONSTANTLY KEPT LOCKED BY HER AND THE KEY HIDDEN INSIDE THE LITTLE CLOCK THAT TICKED SO GENTLY ON THE MANTEL PIECE IN HER ROOM BUT ON SECOND THOUGHT
5765-87740-0022 SHE WAS SO BUSILY ENGAGED DURING THE CHRISTMAS SEASON THAT ACTUALLY SHE FORGOT TO LOCK THE DRAWER THE WHOLE WEEK NEVER DREAMING THAT THIS OVERLOOK ON HER PART WAS SO CLEVERLY TAKEN NOTICE OF BY HER WHO NOT ALONE COMMITTED THE RUFFIANOUS ACT
5765-87740-0023 BUT CAUSED ALL THE BLAME TO BE THROWN ON THE PARTY IN CHARGE THE HOUSEKEEPER WHO FELT SADLY AND VERY MUCH ANNOYED ABOUT THE AFFAIR GRASPED THE WHOLE THING FIRST SHE THOUGHT OF MARJORY'S PROFESSED ILLNESS THE EVENING PREVIOUS
5765-87740-0024 THEN HOW SHE TRIED HER DOOR BEFORE GOING TO BED AND IN THIS ATTEMPT TO ENTER WAS UNSUCCESSFUL AND THAT VERY MORNING THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND FINALLY SHE WAS MISSING AS WELL AS LADY DUNFERN
5765-87740-0025 THE WELL ARRANGED PLOT PICTURED ITSELF IN A MOST VIVID MANNER TO HER WHO IN ONE RESPECT REGARDING THE KEY'S SAFETY WAS ENTIRELY TO BLAME SIR JOHN SUMMONING ALL HIS MEN
5765-87740-0026 ORDERED THEM TO GO AT ONCE AND INTIMATE TO THE OFFICERS OF THE LAW THE SUDDEN FLIGHT OF THE MISCREANTS AND TO TRY AND FIND OUT THEIR WHEREABOUTS BUT NO TRACE OF THEM WAS AS YET NIGH AT HAND THE DECEIVED HUSBAND APPEARED GREATLY CRUSHED
5765-87740-0027 UNDER SUCH A WEIGHT OF SORROW AND WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT THEY COULD BE FOUND OR IF OSCAR OTWELL HE WHO SO OFTEN WROTE TO HIS WIFE DURING HER PERIOD OF IMPRISONMENT HAD OUGHT TO DO WITH HER DARING ADVENTURE AIDED BY MARJORY MASON
5765-87740-0028 IT IS NO LONGER AN UNSOLVED PROBLEM THAT OSCAR OTWELL WAS FROM FIRST TO LAST THE CHIEF IRRITATING ITEM OF SIR JOHN DUNFERN'S UNHAPPINESS AND WHOSE SUPPOSED UNDERHAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH LADY DUNFERN
