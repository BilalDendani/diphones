644-163239-0000 FOR SOME WEEKS CHRISTIE RESTED AND REFRESHED HERSELF BY MAKING HER ROOM GAY
644-163239-0001 AND BY SHARING WITH OTHERS THE MONEY WHICH HARRY HAD SMUGGLED INTO HER POSSESSION AFTER SHE HAD STEADILY REFUSED TO TAKE ONE PENNY MORE THAN THE SUM AGREED UPON WHEN SHE FIRST WENT TO THEM
644-163239-0002 SHE TOOK INFINITE SATISFACTION IN SENDING ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO UNCLE ENOS
644-163239-0003 AND SET HER HEART ON REPAYING EVERY FRACTION OF IT ANOTHER HUNDRED SHE GAVE TO HEPSEY WHO FOUND HER OUT AND CAME TO REPORT HER TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS
644-163239-0004 THE GOOD SOUL HAD VENTURED SOUTH AND TRIED TO BUY HER MOTHER BUT OLE MISSIS WOULD NOT LET HER GO AT ANY PRICE AND THE FAITHFUL CHATTEL WOULD NOT RUN AWAY
644-163239-0005 YOU MUST TAKE IT HEPSEY FOR I COULD NOT REST HAPPY IF I PUT IT AWAY TO LIE IDLE WHILE YOU CAN SAVE MEN AND WOMEN FROM TORMENT WITH IT I'D GIVE IT IF IT WAS MY LAST PENNY
644-163239-0006 FOR I CAN HELP IN NO OTHER WAY AND IF I NEED MONEY I CAN ALWAYS EARN IT THANK GOD SAID CHRISTIE AS HEPSEY HESITATED TO TAKE SO MUCH FROM A FELLOW WORKER
644-163239-0007 THE THOUGHT OF THAT INVESTMENT LAY WARM AT CHRISTIE'S HEART AND NEVER WOKE A REGRET FOR WELL SHE KNEW THAT EVERY DOLLAR OF IT WOULD BE BLESSED
644-163239-0008 SINCE SHARES IN THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD PAY SPLENDID DIVIDENDS THAT NEVER FAIL ANOTHER PORTION OF HER FORTUNE AS SHE CALLED HARRY'S GIFT WAS BESTOWED IN WEDDING PRESENTS UPON LUCY WHO AT LENGTH
644-163239-0009 AND DISTRACTING LEGS AND HAVING GAINED HER POINT MARRIED HIM WITH DRAMATIC CELERITY AND WENT WEST TO FOLLOW THE FORTUNES OF HER LORD THE OLD THEATRE WAS TO BE DEMOLISHED AND THE COMPANY SCATTERED
644-163239-0010 SO A FAREWELL FESTIVAL WAS HELD AND CHRISTIE WENT TO IT FEELING MORE SOLITARY THAN EVER AS SHE BADE HER OLD FRIENDS A LONG GOOD BYE THE REST OF THE MONEY BURNED IN HER POCKET
644-163239-0011 SHE LIKED TO RETURN AT NIGHT TO HER OWN LITTLE HOME SOLITARY AND SIMPLE AS IT WAS AND FELT A GREAT REPUGNANCE TO ACCEPT ANY PLACE WHERE SHE WOULD BE MIXED UP WITH FAMILY AFFAIRS AGAIN
644-163239-0012 SO DAY AFTER DAY SHE WENT TO HER SEAT IN THE WORKROOM WHERE A DOZEN OTHER YOUNG WOMEN SAT SEWING BUSILY ON GAY GARMENTS WITH AS MUCH LIVELY GOSSIP TO BEGUILE THE TIME AS MISS COTTON THE FOREWOMAN WOULD ALLOW
644-163239-0013 FOR A WHILE IT DIVERTED CHRISTIE AS SHE HAD A FEMININE LOVE FOR PRETTY THINGS AND ENJOYED SEEING DELICATE SILKS COSTLY LACE AND ALL THE INDESCRIBABLE FANTASIES OF FASHION
644-163239-0014 BOB O' LINKS MAKING RAPTUROUS MUSIC BY THE RIVER AND THE SMELL OF NEW MOWN HAY
644-163239-0015 MOST ASSUREDLY SHE WOULD HAVE GONE TO FIND THESE THINGS LED BY THE INSTINCTS OF A HEALTHFUL NATURE HAD NOT ONE SLENDER TIE HELD HER TILL IT GREW INTO A BOND SO STRONG SHE COULD NOT BREAK IT
644-163239-0016 AMONG HER COMPANIONS WAS ONE AND ONE ONLY WHO ATTRACTED HER THE OTHERS WERE WELL MEANING GIRLS BUT
644-163239-0017 AND THEIR DULL LIFE FOSTERED
644-163239-0018 AND WAGES WERE THE THREE TOPICS WHICH ABSORBED THEM CHRISTIE SOON TIRED OF THE INNUMERABLE CHANGES RUNG UPON THESE THEMES
644-163239-0019 HER EVENINGS AT HOME WERE DEVOTED TO BOOKS FOR SHE HAD THE TRUE NEW ENGLAND WOMAN'S DESIRE FOR EDUCATION AND READ OR STUDIED FOR THE LOVE OF IT THUS SHE HAD MUCH TO THINK OF AS HER NEEDLE FLEW
644-163239-0020 AND WAS RAPIDLY BECOMING A SORT OF SEWING MACHINE WHEN LIFE WAS BRIGHTENED FOR HER BY THE FINDING OF A FRIEND AMONG THE GIRLS WAS ONE QUIET SKILFUL CREATURE
644-163239-0021 WHOSE BLACK DRESS PECULIAR FACE AND SILENT WAYS ATTRACTED CHRISTIE HER EVIDENT DESIRE TO BE LET ALONE AMUSED THE NEW COMER AT FIRST AND SHE MADE NO EFFORT TO KNOW HER BUT PRESENTLY SHE BECAME AWARE
644-163239-0022 BUT RACHEL ONLY COLORED KEPT HER EYES FIXED ON HER WORK AND WAS MORE RESERVED THAN EVER THIS INTERESTED CHRISTIE
644-163239-0023 FOR SHE WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS THOUGH EVIDENTLY YOUNGER THAN SHE LOOKED RACHEL'S FACE WAS THAT OF ONE WHO HAD KNOWN SOME GREAT SORROW SOME DEEP EXPERIENCE
644-163239-0024 FOR THERE WERE LINES ON THE FOREHEAD THAT CONTRASTED STRONGLY WITH THE BRIGHT ABUNDANT HAIR ABOVE
644-163239-0025 AND THE EYES WERE OLD WITH THAT INDESCRIBABLE EXPRESSION WHICH COMES TO THOSE WHO COUNT THEIR LIVES BY EMOTIONS NOT BY YEARS STRANGELY HAUNTING EYES TO CHRISTIE FOR THEY SEEMED TO APPEAL TO HER
644-163239-0026 WITH A MUTE ELOQUENCE SHE COULD NOT RESIST IN VAIN DID RACHEL ANSWER HER WITH QUIET COLDNESS NOD SILENTLY WHEN SHE WISHED HER A CHEERY GOOD MORNING AND KEEP RESOLUTELY IN HER OWN SOMEWHAT ISOLATED CORNER
644-163239-0027 THOUGH INVITED TO SHARE THE SUNNY WINDOW WHERE THE OTHER SAT HER EYES BELIED HER WORDS AND THOSE FUGITIVE GLANCES BETRAYED THE LONGING OF A LONELY HEART
644-163239-0028 SO FREELY OFFERED IT CHRISTIE WAS SURE OF THIS
644-163239-0029 FOR HER OWN HEART WAS VERY SOLITARY SHE MISSED HELEN AND LONGED TO FILL THE EMPTY PLACE
644-163239-0030 AS PATIENTLY AND AS GENTLY AS A LOVER MIGHT DETERMINED TO WIN HER CONFIDENCE BECAUSE ALL THE OTHERS HAD FAILED TO DO IT SOMETIMES SHE LEFT A FLOWER IN RACHEL'S BASKET ALWAYS SMILED AND NODDED AS SHE ENTERED
644-163239-0031 AND OFTEN STOPPED TO ADMIRE THE WORK OF HER TASTEFUL FINGERS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST SUCH FRIENDLY OVERTURES
644-163239-0032 OR KNOW WHAT A BLESSED THING IT IS TO FIND SUCH AN ONE AS YOU ARE THEN I MAY LOVE YOU AND NOT BE AFRAID OF OFFENDING CRIED CHRISTIE MUCH TOUCHED YES
644-163239-0033 BUT REMEMBER I DIDN'T ASK IT FIRST SAID RACHEL HALF DROPPING THE HAND SHE HAD HELD IN BOTH HER OWN YOU PROUD CREATURE I'LL REMEMBER
644-163239-0034 AND WHEN WE QUARREL I'LL TAKE ALL THE BLAME UPON MYSELF THEN CHRISTIE KISSED HER WARMLY WHISKED AWAY THE TEAR
644-163239-0035 AND A SMILE THAT SHOWED HOW WINSOME HER FACE HAD BEEN BEFORE MANY TEARS WASHED ITS BLOOM AWAY
644-163239-0036 CHRISTIE KEPT HER WORD ASKED NO QUESTIONS VOLUNTEERED NO CONFIDENCES BUT HEARTILY ENJOYED THE NEW FRIENDSHIP
644-163239-0037 WHICH IT HAD LACKED BEFORE NOW SOME ONE CARED FOR HER AND BETTER STILL SHE COULD MAKE SOME ONE HAPPY AND IN THE ACT OF LAVISHING THE AFFECTION OF HER GENEROUS NATURE ON A CREATURE SADDER
644-163239-0038 AND MORE SOLITARY THAN HERSELF
644-163239-0039 THERE WAS NOTHING IN HER POSSESSION THAT SHE DID NOT OFFER RACHEL
