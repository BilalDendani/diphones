4993-40677-0000 WHAT THEN SHALL BE THE SPECIAL IMPUTATION AGAINST WHICH I SHALL THROW MYSELF IN THESE PAGES OUT OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE WHICH MY ACCUSER DIRECTS UPON ME I MEAN TO CONFINE MYSELF TO ONE
4993-40677-0001 FOR THERE IS ONLY ONE ABOUT WHICH I MUCH CARE THE CHARGE OF UNTRUTHFULNESS HE MAY CAST UPON ME AS MANY OTHER IMPUTATIONS AS HE PLEASES AND THEY MAY STICK ON ME AS LONG AS THEY CAN
4993-40677-0002 IN THE COURSE OF NATURE THEY WILL FALL TO THE GROUND IN THEIR SEASON AND INDEED I THINK THE SAME OF THE CHARGE OF UNTRUTHFULNESS AND SELECT IT FROM THE REST NOT BECAUSE IT IS MORE FORMIDABLE
4993-40677-0003 BUT BECAUSE IT IS MORE SERIOUS LIKE THE REST IT MAY DISFIGURE ME FOR A TIME BUT IT WILL NOT STAIN ARCHBISHOP WHATELY USED TO SAY THROW DIRT ENOUGH AND SOME WILL STICK WELL
4993-40677-0004 WILL STICK BUT NOT WILL STAIN I THINK HE USED TO MEAN STAIN AND I DO NOT AGREE WITH HIM SOME DIRT STICKS LONGER THAN OTHER DIRT BUT NO DIRT IS IMMORTAL ACCORDING TO THE OLD SAYING
4993-40677-0005 PRAEVALEBIT VERITAS THERE ARE VIRTUES INDEED WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT FITTED TO JUDGE OF OR TO UPHOLD SUCH AS FAITH HOPE AND CHARITY BUT IT CAN JUDGE ABOUT TRUTHFULNESS
4993-40677-0006 IT CAN JUDGE ABOUT THE NATURAL VIRTUES AND TRUTHFULNESS IS ONE OF THEM NATURAL VIRTUES MAY ALSO BECOME SUPERNATURAL TRUTHFULNESS IS SUCH
4993-40677-0007 BUT THAT IS A QUESTION OF CAPACITY NOT OF RIGHT MANKIND HAS THE RIGHT TO JUDGE OF TRUTHFULNESS IN A CATHOLIC AS IN THE CASE OF A PROTESTANT OF AN ITALIAN OR OF A CHINESE I HAVE NEVER DOUBTED
4993-40677-0008 THAT IN MY HOUR IN GOD'S HOUR MY AVENGER WILL APPEAR AND THE WORLD WILL ACQUIT ME OF UNTRUTHFULNESS EVEN THOUGH IT BE NOT WHILE I LIVE STILL MORE CONFIDENT AM I OF SUCH EVENTUAL ACQUITTAL
4993-40677-0009 SEEING THAT MY JUDGES ARE MY OWN COUNTRYMEN I CONSIDER INDEED ENGLISHMEN THE MOST SUSPICIOUS AND TOUCHY OF MANKIND I THINK THEM UNREASONABLE AND UNJUST IN THEIR SEASONS OF EXCITEMENT BUT I HAD RATHER BE AN ENGLISHMAN AS IN FACT I AM
4993-40677-0010 THAN BELONG TO ANY OTHER RACE UNDER HEAVEN THEY ARE AS GENEROUS AS THEY ARE HASTY AND BURLY AND THEIR REPENTANCE FOR THEIR INJUSTICE IS GREATER THAN THEIR SIN FOR TWENTY YEARS AND MORE I HAVE BORNE AN IMPUTATION
4993-40677-0011 THE DISPOSITION TO HEAR I HAVE WISHED TO APPEAL FROM PHILIP DRUNK TO PHILIP SOBER WHEN SHALL I PRONOUNCE HIM TO BE HIMSELF AGAIN IF I MAY JUDGE FROM THE TONE OF THE PUBLIC PRESS
4993-40677-0012 WHICH REPRESENTS THE PUBLIC VOICE I HAVE GREAT REASON TO TAKE HEART AT THIS TIME I HAVE BEEN TREATED BY CONTEMPORARY CRITICS IN THIS CONTROVERSY WITH GREAT FAIRNESS AND GENTLENESS AND I AM GRATEFUL TO THEM FOR IT
4993-40677-0013 HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT OF MY HANDS AND I AM THANKFUL THAT IT HAS BEEN SO I AM BOUND NOW AS A DUTY TO MYSELF TO THE CATHOLIC CAUSE
4993-40677-0014 TO GIVE ACCOUNT OF MYSELF WITHOUT ANY DELAY WHEN I AM SO RUDELY AND CIRCUMSTANTIALLY CHARGED WITH UNTRUTHFULNESS I ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE I SHALL DO MY BEST TO MEET IT AND I SHALL BE CONTENT WHEN I HAVE DONE SO
4993-40677-0015 THE IMPRESSION TWENTY YEARS AGO AND THE IMPRESSION NOW THERE HAS BEEN A GENERAL FEELING THAT I WAS FOR YEARS WHERE I HAD NO RIGHT TO BE THAT I WAS A ROMANIST IN PROTESTANT LIVERY AND SERVICE
4993-40677-0016 THAT I WAS DOING THE WORK OF A HOSTILE CHURCH IN THE BOSOM OF THE ENGLISH ESTABLISHMENT AND KNEW IT OR OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN
4993-40677-0017 FIRST IT WAS CERTAIN AND I COULD NOT MYSELF DENY IT THAT I SCOUTED THE NAME PROTESTANT IT WAS CERTAIN AGAIN THAT MANY OF THE DOCTRINES WHICH I PROFESSED WERE POPULARLY AND GENERALLY KNOWN AS BADGES OF THE ROMAN CHURCH
4993-40677-0018 AS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE FAITH OF THE REFORMATION NEXT HOW COULD I HAVE COME BY THEM EVIDENTLY I HAD CERTAIN FRIENDS AND ADVISERS WHO DID NOT APPEAR THERE WAS SOME UNDERGROUND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN
4993-40677-0019 STONYHURST OR OSCOTT AND MY ROOMS AT ORIEL BEYOND A DOUBT I WAS ADVOCATING CERTAIN DOCTRINES NOT BY ACCIDENT BUT ON AN UNDERSTANDING WITH ECCLESIASTICS OF THE OLD RELIGION
4993-40677-0020 OTHERS WENT EVEN FURTHER AND GAVE IT OUT TO THE WORLD AS A MATTER OF FACT OF WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAD THE PROOF IN THEIR HANDS THAT I WAS ACTUALLY A JESUIT AND WHEN THE OPINIONS WHICH I ADVOCATED SPREAD
4993-40677-0021 AND YOUNGER MEN WENT FURTHER THAN I THE FEELING AGAINST ME WAXED STRONGER AND TOOK A WIDER RANGE AND NOW INDIGNATION AROSE AT THE KNAVERY OF A CONSPIRACY SUCH AS THIS
4993-40677-0022 AND IT BECAME OF COURSE ALL THE GREATER IN CONSEQUENCE OF ITS BEING THE RECEIVED BELIEF OF THE PUBLIC AT LARGE THAT CRAFT AND INTRIGUE SUCH AS THEY FANCIED THEY BEHELD WITH THEIR EYES WERE THE VERY INSTRUMENTS
4993-40677-0023 TO WHICH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS IN THESE LAST CENTURIES BEEN INDEBTED FOR HER MAINTENANCE AND EXTENSION THERE WAS ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE STILL
4993-40677-0024 OF WHOM I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING AGAINST THE PREACHERS OF DOCTRINES SO NEW TO THEM AND SO UNPALATABLE AND THAT WAS THAT THEY DEVELOPED THEM IN SO MEASURED A WAY IF THEY WERE INSPIRED BY ROMAN THEOLOGIANS
4993-40677-0025 AND THIS WAS TAKEN FOR GRANTED WHY DID THEY NOT SPEAK OUT AT ONCE WHY DID THEY KEEP THE WORLD IN SUCH SUSPENSE AND ANXIETY AS TO WHAT WAS COMING NEXT
4993-40677-0026 WHY THIS RETICENCE AND HALF SPEAKING AND APPARENT INDECISION IT WAS PLAIN THAT THE PLAN OF OPERATIONS HAD BEEN CAREFULLY MAPPED OUT FROM THE FIRST AND THAT THESE MEN WERE CAUTIOUSLY ADVANCING TOWARDS ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT
4993-40677-0027 AS FAR AS WAS SAFE AT THE MOMENT THAT THEIR AIM AND THEIR HOPE WAS TO CARRY OFF A LARGE BODY WITH THEM OF THE YOUNG AND THE IGNORANT THAT THEY MEANT GRADUALLY TO LEAVEN THE MINDS OF THE RISING GENERATION AND TO OPEN THE GATES OF THAT CITY
4993-40677-0028 AND WHEN IN SPITE OF THE MANY PROTESTATIONS OF THE PARTY TO THE CONTRARY THERE WAS AT LENGTH AN ACTUAL MOVEMENT AMONG THEIR DISCIPLES AND ONE WENT OVER TO ROME AND THEN ANOTHER THE WORST ANTICIPATIONS AND THE WORST JUDGMENTS
4993-40677-0029 AND WHEN AFTER ALL AFTER MY ARGUMENTS AND DENUNCIATIONS OF FORMER YEARS AT LENGTH I DID LEAVE THE ANGLICAN CHURCH FOR THE ROMAN THEN THEY SAID TO EACH OTHER IT IS JUST AS WE SAID WE KNEW IT WOULD BE SO
4993-40677-0030 THIS WAS THE STATE OF MIND OF MASSES OF MEN TWENTY YEARS AGO WHO TOOK NO MORE THAN AN EXTERNAL AND COMMON SENSE VIEW OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AND PARTLY THE TRADITION PARTLY THE EFFECT OF THAT FEELING
4993-40677-0031 NOT ONLY AM I NOW A MEMBER OF A MOST UN ENGLISH COMMUNION WHOSE GREAT AIM IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE EXTINCTION OF PROTESTANTISM AND THE PROTESTANT CHURCH AND WHOSE MEANS OF ATTACK ARE POPULARLY SUPPOSED TO BE
4993-40677-0032 DID I OR MY OPINIONS DROP FROM THE SKY
4993-40677-0033 TO PRESENT MYSELF TO THE EYES OF MEN IN THAT FULL BLOWN INVESTITURE OF POPERY HOW COULD I DARE HOW COULD I HAVE THE CONSCIENCE WITH WARNINGS WITH PROPHECIES WITH ACCUSATIONS AGAINST ME
4993-40677-0034 WHICH ENDED IN THE RELIGION OF ROME
4993-40677-0035 WHEN LONG AGO I WAS TRUSTED AND WAS FOUND WANTING IT IS THIS WHICH IS THE STRENGTH OF THE CASE OF MY ACCUSER AGAINST ME NOT THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT WHICH HE HAS FRAMED FROM MY WRITINGS
4993-40677-0036 AND WHICH I SHALL EASILY CRUMBLE INTO DUST BUT THE BIAS OF THE COURT IT IS THE STATE OF THE ATMOSPHERE
4993-40677-0037 WHICH TAKES IT FOR GRANTED THAT WHEN MY REASONING IS CONVINCING IT IS ONLY INGENIOUS AND THAT WHEN MY STATEMENTS ARE UNANSWERABLE THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING PUT OUT OF SIGHT OR HIDDEN IN MY SLEEVE IT IS THAT PLAUSIBLE BUT CRUEL CONCLUSION
4993-40677-0038 THAT WHEN MUCH IS IMPUTED MUCH MUST BE TRUE
4993-40677-0039 AND I THINK I SHALL BE ABLE TO DO SO WHEN FIRST I READ THE PAMPHLET OF ACCUSATION I ALMOST DESPAIRED OF MEETING EFFECTIVELY SUCH A HEAP OF MISREPRESENTATIONS AND SUCH A VEHEMENCE OF ANIMOSITY
4993-40677-0040 OF THE SEPARATE COUNTS IN THE INDICTMENT WHEN REJOINDERS OF THIS SORT WOULD BUT CONFUSE AND TORMENT THE READER BY THEIR NUMBER AND THEIR DIVERSITY
4993-40677-0041 MATTER WHICH OUGHT FREELY TO EXPAND ITSELF INTO HALF A DOZEN VOLUMES
4993-40677-0042 TO SET RIGHT EVEN ONE OF THAT SERIES OF SINGLE PASSING HINTS TO USE MY ASSAILANT'S OWN LANGUAGE WHICH AS WITH HIS FINGER TIP HE HAD DELIVERED AGAINST ME
4993-40677-0043 WITH AN INTERPRETATION HE CALLED ME A LIAR A SIMPLE A BROAD AN INTELLIGIBLE TO THE ENGLISH PUBLIC A PLAUSIBLE ARRAIGNMENT
4993-40677-0044 BUT FOR ME TO ANSWER IN DETAIL CHARGE ONE BY REASON ONE AND CHARGE TWO BY REASON TWO AND CHARGE THREE BY REASON THREE AND SO ON THROUGH THE WHOLE STRING BOTH OF ACCUSATIONS AND REPLIES
4993-40677-0045 EACH OF WHICH WAS TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THE REST THIS WOULD BE CERTAINLY LABOUR LOST AS REGARDS ANY EFFECTIVE RESULT WHAT I NEEDED WAS A CORRESPONDING ANTAGONIST UNITY IN MY DEFENCE
4993-40677-0046 AND WHERE WAS THAT TO BE FOUND WE SEE IN THE CASE OF COMMENTATORS ON THE PROPHECIES OF SCRIPTURE AN EXEMPLIFICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH I AM INSISTING
4993-40677-0047 THE READER SAYS WHAT ELSE CAN THE PROPHECY MEAN JUST AS MY ACCUSER ASKS WHAT THEN DOES DOCTOR NEWMAN MEAN I REFLECTED AND I SAW A WAY OUT OF MY PERPLEXITY
4993-40677-0048 YES I SAID TO MYSELF HIS VERY QUESTION IS ABOUT MY MEANING
4993-40677-0049 IT POINTED IN THE VERY SAME DIRECTION AS THAT INTO WHICH MY MUSINGS HAD TURNED ME ALREADY HE ASKS WHAT I MEAN NOT ABOUT MY WORDS
4993-40677-0050 NOT ABOUT MY ARGUMENTS NOT ABOUT MY ACTIONS AS HIS ULTIMATE POINT BUT ABOUT THAT LIVING INTELLIGENCE BY WHICH I WRITE AND ARGUE AND ACT HE ASKS ABOUT MY MIND AND ITS BELIEFS
4993-40677-0051 AND ITS SENTIMENTS AND HE SHALL BE ANSWERED NOT FOR HIS OWN SAKE BUT FOR MINE FOR THE SAKE OF THE RELIGION WHICH I PROFESS AND OF THE PRIESTHOOD IN WHICH I AM UNWORTHILY INCLUDED
4993-40677-0052 AND OF MY FRIENDS AND OF MY FOES AND OF THAT GENERAL PUBLIC WHICH CONSISTS OF NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER BUT OF WELL WISHERS LOVERS OF FAIR PLAY SCEPTICAL CROSS QUESTIONERS INTERESTED
4993-40677-0053 INQUIRERS CURIOUS LOOKERS ON AND SIMPLE STRANGERS UNCONCERNED YET NOT CARELESS ABOUT THE ISSUE FOR THE SAKE OF ALL THESE HE SHALL BE ANSWERED MY PERPLEXITY HAD NOT LASTED HALF AN HOUR
4993-40677-0054 THAT IT MAY BE SEEN WHAT I AM NOT AND THAT THE PHANTOM MAY BE EXTINGUISHED WHICH GIBBERS INSTEAD OF ME I WISH TO BE KNOWN AS A LIVING MAN AND NOT AS A SCARECROW WHICH IS DRESSED UP IN MY CLOTHES
4993-40677-0055 FALSE IDEAS MAY BE REFUTED INDEED BY ARGUMENT BUT BY TRUE IDEAS ALONE ARE THEY EXPELLED I WILL VANQUISH NOT MY ACCUSER BUT MY JUDGES
4993-40677-0056 I WILL INDEED ANSWER HIS CHARGES AND CRITICISMS ON ME ONE BY ONE
4993-40677-0057 BUT SUCH A WORK SHALL NOT BE THE SCOPE NOR THE SUBSTANCE OF MY REPLY
4993-40677-0058 I WILL STATE THE POINT AT WHICH I BEGAN IN WHAT EXTERNAL SUGGESTION OR ACCIDENT EACH OPINION HAD ITS RISE HOW FAR AND HOW THEY DEVELOPED FROM WITHIN HOW THEY GREW WERE MODIFIED
4993-40677-0059 WERE COMBINED WERE IN COLLISION WITH EACH OTHER AND WERE CHANGED AGAIN HOW I CONDUCTED MYSELF TOWARDS THEM AND HOW AND HOW FAR AND FOR HOW LONG A TIME
4993-40677-0060 WITH THE ECCLESIASTICAL ENGAGEMENTS WHICH I HAD MADE AND WITH THE POSITION WHICH I HELD I MUST SHOW WHAT IS THE VERY TRUTH THAT THE DOCTRINES WHICH I HELD AND HAVE HELD FOR SO MANY YEARS
4993-40677-0061 HAVE BEEN TAUGHT ME SPEAKING HUMANLY PARTLY BY THE SUGGESTIONS OF PROTESTANT FRIENDS
4993-40677-0062 AND THUS I SHALL ACCOUNT FOR THAT PHENOMENON WHICH TO SO MANY SEEMS SO WONDERFUL THAT I SHOULD HAVE LEFT MY KINDRED AND MY FATHER'S HOUSE FOR A CHURCH FROM WHICH ONCE I TURNED AWAY WITH DREAD SO WONDERFUL TO THEM
4993-40677-0063 AS IF FORSOOTH A RELIGION WHICH HAS FLOURISHED THROUGH SO MANY AGES AMONG SO MANY NATIONS AMID SUCH VARIETIES OF SOCIAL LIFE IN SUCH CONTRARY CLASSES AND CONDITIONS OF MEN
4993-40677-0064 AND AFTER SO MANY REVOLUTIONS POLITICAL AND CIVIL COULD NOT SUBDUE THE REASON
4993-40677-0065 AND THEN AS TO THE MATERIALS OF MY NARRATIVE I HAVE NO AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL NOTES TO CONSULT NO WRITTEN EXPLANATIONS OF PARTICULAR TREATISES OR OF TRACTS WHICH AT THE TIME GAVE OFFENCE
4993-40677-0066 HARDLY ANY MINUTES OF DEFINITE TRANSACTIONS OR CONVERSATIONS AND FEW CONTEMPORARY MEMORANDA I FEAR OF THE FEELINGS OR MOTIVES UNDER WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME I ACTED
4993-40677-0067 TO BE AVAILABLE AT A MOMENT FOR MY PURPOSE THEN AS TO THE VOLUMES WHICH I HAVE PUBLISHED THEY WOULD IN MANY WAYS SERVE ME WERE I WELL UP IN THEM BUT THOUGH I TOOK GREAT PAINS IN THEIR COMPOSITION
4993-40677-0068 I HAVE THOUGHT LITTLE ABOUT THEM WHEN THEY WERE ONCE OUT OF MY HANDS AND FOR THE MOST PART THE LAST TIME I READ THEM HAS BEEN WHEN I REVISED THEIR LAST PROOF SHEETS
4993-40677-0069 UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MY SKETCH WILL OF COURSE BE INCOMPLETE I NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME CONTEMPLATE MY COURSE AS A WHOLE IT IS A FIRST ESSAY
4993-40677-0070 AND SO FAR WILL ANSWER THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH I WRITE IT I PURPOSE TO SET NOTHING DOWN IN IT AS CERTAIN OF WHICH I HAVE NOT A CLEAR MEMORY OR SOME WRITTEN MEMORIAL OR THE CORROBORATION OF SOME FRIEND THERE ARE WITNESSES ENOUGH
4993-40677-0071 UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY TO VERIFY OR CORRECT OR COMPLETE IT
4993-40677-0072 I WISH AS FAR AS I AM ABLE SIMPLY TO STATE FACTS WHETHER THEY ARE ULTIMATELY DETERMINED TO BE FOR ME OR AGAINST ME OF COURSE THERE WILL BE ROOM ENOUGH FOR CONTRARIETY OF JUDGMENT
4993-40677-0073 AMONG MY READERS AS TO THE NECESSITY OR APPOSITENESS OR VALUE OR GOOD TASTE OR RELIGIOUS PRUDENCE OF THE DETAILS WHICH I SHALL INTRODUCE I MAY BE ACCUSED OF LAYING STRESS ON LITTLE THINGS
4993-40677-0074 OF BEING BESIDE THE MARK OF GOING INTO IMPERTINENT OR RIDICULOUS DETAILS OF SOUNDING MY OWN PRAISE OF GIVING SCANDAL BUT THIS IS A CASE ABOVE ALL OTHERS IN WHICH I AM BOUND TO FOLLOW MY OWN LIGHTS
4993-40677-0075 AND TO SPEAK OUT MY OWN HEART IT IS NOT AT ALL PLEASANT FOR ME TO BE EGOTISTICAL NOR TO BE CRITICIZED FOR BEING SO IT IS NOT PLEASANT TO REVEAL TO HIGH AND LOW YOUNG AND OLD
4993-40677-0076 WHAT HAS GONE ON WITHIN ME FROM MY EARLY YEARS IT IS NOT PLEASANT TO BE GIVING TO EVERY SHALLOW OR FLIPPANT DISPUTANT THE ADVANTAGE OVER ME OF KNOWING MY MOST PRIVATE THOUGHTS
4993-40677-0077 I MIGHT EVEN SAY THE INTERCOURSE BETWEEN MYSELF AND MY MAKER BUT I DO NOT LIKE TO BE CALLED TO MY FACE A LIAR AND A KNAVE NOR SHOULD I BE DOING MY DUTY TO MY FAITH
