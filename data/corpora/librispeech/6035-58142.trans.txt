6035-58142-0000 THE OTHER MORNING AT BREAKFAST MISSUS PERKINS OBSERVED THAT MISTER STIVER IN WHOSE HOUSE WE LIVE HAD BEEN CALLED AWAY AND WANTED TO KNOW IF I WOULD SEE TO HIS HORSE THROUGH THE DAY
6035-58142-0001 I KNEW THAT MISTER STIVER OWNED A HORSE BECAUSE I OCCASIONALLY SAW HIM DRIVE OUT OF THE YARD AND I SAW THE STABLE EVERY DAY BUT WHAT KIND OF A HORSE I DIDN'T KNOW I NEVER WENT INTO THE STABLE FOR TWO REASONS IN THE FIRST PLACE
6035-58142-0002 I HAD NO DESIRE TO AND SECONDLY I DIDN'T KNOW AS THE HORSE CARED PARTICULARLY FOR COMPANY I NEVER TOOK CARE OF A HORSE IN MY LIFE AND HAD I BEEN OF A LESS HOPEFUL NATURE
6035-58142-0003 THE CHARGE MISTER STIVER HAD LEFT WITH ME MIGHT HAVE HAD A VERY DEPRESSING EFFECT BUT I TOLD MISSUS PERKINS I WOULD DO IT YOU KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF A HORSE DON'T YOU SAID SHE I GAVE HER A REASSURING WINK
6035-58142-0004 IN FACT I KNEW SO LITTLE ABOUT IT THAT I DIDN'T THINK IT SAFE TO CONVERSE MORE FLUENTLY THAN BY WINKS AFTER BREAKFAST I SEIZED A TOOTHPICK AND WALKED OUT TOWARDS THE STABLE
6035-58142-0005 THERE WAS NOTHING PARTICULAR TO DO AS STIVER HAD GIVEN HIM HIS BREAKFAST AND I FOUND HIM EATING IT SO I LOOKED AROUND THE HORSE LOOKED AROUND TOO AND STARED PRETTY HARD AT ME THERE WAS BUT LITTLE SAID ON EITHER SIDE
6035-58142-0006 I HUNTED UP THE LOCATION OF THE FEED AND THEN SAT DOWN ON A PECK MEASURE AND FELL TO STUDYING THE BEAST THERE IS A WIDE DIFFERENCE IN HORSES SOME OF THEM WILL KICK YOU OVER AND NEVER LOOK AROUND TO SEE WHAT BECOMES OF YOU
6035-58142-0007 I DON'T LIKE A DISPOSITION LIKE THAT AND I WONDERED IF STIVER'S HORSE WAS ONE OF THEM WHEN I CAME HOME AT NOON I WENT STRAIGHT TO THE STABLE THE ANIMAL WAS THERE ALL RIGHT STIVER HADN'T TOLD ME WHAT TO GIVE HIM FOR DINNER
6035-58142-0008 AND I HAD NOT GIVEN THE SUBJECT ANY THOUGHT BUT I WENT TO THE OAT BOX AND FILLED THE PECK MEASURE AND SALLIED BOLDLY UP TO THE MANGER WHEN HE SAW THE OATS HE ALMOST SMILED THIS PLEASED AND AMUSED HIM I EMPTIED THEM INTO THE TROUGH
6035-58142-0009 AND LEFT HIM ABOVE ME TO ADMIRE THE WAY I PARTED MY HAIR BEHIND I JUST GOT MY HEAD UP IN TIME TO SAVE THE WHOLE OF IT HE HAD HIS EARS BACK HIS MOUTH OPEN
6035-58142-0010 AND LOOKED AS IF HE WERE ON THE POINT OF COMMITTING MURDER I WENT OUT AND FILLED THE MEASURE AGAIN AND CLIMBED UP THE SIDE OF THE STALL AND
6035-58142-0011 LETTING GO OF EVERYTHING TO DO IT I STRUCK ON THE SHARP EDGE OF A BARREL ROLLED OVER A COUPLE OF TIMES THEN DISAPPEARED UNDER A HAY CUTTER THE PECK MEASURE WENT DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE AND GOT MYSTERIOUSLY TANGLED UP IN THAT ANIMAL'S HEELS
6035-58142-0012 AND HE WENT TO WORK AT IT AND THEN ENSUED THE MOST DREADFUL NOISE I EVER HEARD IN ALL MY LIFE AND I HAVE BEEN MARRIED EIGHTEEN YEARS IT DID SEEM AS IF I NEVER WOULD GET OUT FROM UNDER THAT HAY CUTTER
6035-58142-0013 AND ALL THE WHILE I WAS STRUGGLING AND WRENCHING MYSELF AND THE CUTTER APART
6035-58142-0014 WHEN I GOT OUT I FOUND MISSUS PERKINS AT THE DOOR SHE HAD HEARD THE RACKET AND HAD SPED OUT TO THE STABLE HER ONLY THOUGHT BEING OF ME AND THREE STOVE LIDS WHICH SHE HAD UNDER HER ARM AND ONE OF WHICH SHE WAS ABOUT TO FIRE AT THE BEAST
6035-58142-0015 THIS MADE ME MAD GO AWAY YOU UNFORTUNATE IDIOT I SHOUTED DO YOU WANT TO KNOCK MY BRAINS OUT FOR I REMEMBERED SEEING MISSUS PERKINS SLING A MISSILE ONCE BEFORE
6035-58142-0016 AND THAT I NEARLY LOST AN EYE BY THE OPERATION ALTHOUGH STANDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE AT THE TIME SHE RETIRED AT ONCE AND AT THE SAME TIME THE ANIMAL QUIETED DOWN BUT THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT OF THAT PECK MEASURE
6035-58142-0017 I FOLLOWED MISSUS PERKINS INTO THE HOUSE AND HAD HER DO ME UP AND THEN I SAT DOWN IN A CHAIR AND FELL INTO A PROFOUND STRAIN OF MEDITATION AFTER A WHILE I FELT BETTER AND WENT OUT TO THE STABLE AGAIN
6035-58142-0018 THE HORSE WAS LEANING AGAINST THE STABLE STALL WITH EYES HALF CLOSED AND APPEARED TO BE VERY MUCH ENGROSSED IN THOUGHT STEP OFF TO THE LEFT I SAID RUBBING HIS BACK HE DIDN'T STEP
6035-58142-0019 I GOT THE PITCHFORK AND PUNCHED HIM IN THE LEG WITH THE HANDLE HE IMMEDIATELY RAISED UP BOTH HIND LEGS AT ONCE AND THAT FORK FLEW OUT OF MY HANDS AND WENT RATTLING UP AGAINST THE TIMBERS ABOVE
6035-58142-0020 AND CAME DOWN AGAIN IN AN INSTANT THE END OF THE HANDLE RAPPING ME WITH SUCH FORCE ON THE TOP OF THE HEAD THAT I SAT RIGHT DOWN ON THE FLOOR UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF A DRUG STORE IN THE EVENING
6035-58142-0021 BUT I COULDN'T KEEP AWAY FROM THAT STABLE I WENT OUT THERE AGAIN THE THOUGHT STRUCK ME THAT WHAT THE HORSE WANTED WAS EXERCISE IF THAT THOUGHT HAD BEEN AN EMPTY GLYCERIN CAN
6035-58142-0022 BUT EXERCISE WOULD TONE HIM DOWN AND EXERCISE HIM I SHOULD I LAUGHED TO MYSELF TO THINK HOW I WOULD TROUNCE HIM AROUND THE YARD I DIDN'T LAUGH AGAIN THAT AFTERNOON
6035-58142-0023 I GOT HIM UNHITCHED AND THEN WONDERED HOW I WAS TO GET HIM OUT OF THE STALL WITHOUT CARRYING HIM OUT I PUSHED BUT HE WOULDN'T BUDGE I STOOD LOOKING AT HIM IN THE FACE THINKING OF SOMETHING TO SAY
6035-58142-0024 WHEN HE SUDDENLY SOLVED THE DIFFICULTY BY VEERING ABOUT AND PLUNGING FOR THE DOOR I FOLLOWED AS A MATTER OF COURSE BECAUSE I HAD A TIGHT HOLD ON THE ROPE AND HIT ABOUT EVERY PARTITION STUD WORTH SPEAKING OF ON THAT SIDE OF THE BARN
6035-58142-0025 MISSUS PERKINS WAS AT THE WINDOW AND SAW US COME OUT OF THE DOOR SHE SUBSEQUENTLY REMARKED THAT WE CAME OUT SKIPPING LIKE TWO INNOCENT CHILDREN THE SKIPPING WAS ENTIRELY UNINTENTIONAL ON MY PART
6035-58142-0026 I FELT AS IF I STOOD ON THE VERGE OF ETERNITY MY LEGS MAY HAVE SKIPPED BUT MY MIND WAS FILLED WITH AWE I TOOK THE ANIMAL OUT TO EXERCISE HIM HE EXERCISED ME BEFORE I GOT THROUGH WITH IT
6035-58142-0027 HE WENT AROUND A FEW TIMES IN A CIRCLE THEN HE STOPPED SUDDENLY SPREAD OUT HIS FORELEGS AND LOOKED AT ME THEN HE LEANED FORWARD A LITTLE AND HOISTED BOTH HIND LEGS AND THREW ABOUT TWO COAL HODS OF MUD
6035-58142-0028 THAT EXCELLENT LADY HAD TAKEN A POSITION AT THE WINDOW AND WHENEVER THE EVOLUTIONS OF THE AWFUL BEAST PERMITTED I CAUGHT A GLANCE OF HER FEATURES SHE APPEARED TO BE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN THE PROCEEDINGS BUT THE INSTANT THAT THE MUD FLEW
6035-58142-0029 SHE DISAPPEARED FROM THE WINDOW AND A MOMENT LATER SHE APPEARED ON THE STOOP
6035-58142-0030 JUST THEN STIVER'S HORSE STOOD UP ON HIS HIND LEGS AND TRIED TO HUG ME WITH THE OTHERS THIS SCARED ME A HORSE NEVER SHOWS HIS STRENGTH TO SUCH ADVANTAGE AS WHEN HE IS COMING DOWN ON YOU LIKE A FRANTIC PILE DRIVER
6035-58142-0031 I INSTANTLY DODGED AND THE COLD SWEAT FAIRLY BOILED OUT OF ME IT SUDDENLY CAME OVER ME THAT I HAD ONCE FIGURED IN A SIMILAR POSITION YEARS AGO
6035-58142-0032 MY GRANDFATHER OWNED A LITTLE WHITE HORSE THAT WOULD GET UP FROM A MEAL AT DELMONICO'S TO KICK THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HE SENT ME TO THE LOT ONE DAY AND UNHAPPILY SUGGESTED THAT I OFTEN WENT AFTER THAT HORSE
6035-58142-0033 AND SUFFERED ALL KINDS OF DEFEAT IN GETTING HIM OUT OF THE PASTURE BUT I HAD NEVER TRIED TO RIDE HIM HEAVEN KNOWS I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT I HAD MY USUAL TROUBLE WITH HIM THAT DAY HE TRIED TO JUMP OVER ME AND PUSH ME DOWN IN A MUD HOLE
6035-58142-0034 AND FINALLY GOT UP ON HIS HIND LEGS AND CAME WALTZING AFTER ME WITH FACILITIES ENOUGH TO CONVERT ME INTO HASH BUT I TURNED AND JUST MADE FOR THAT FENCE WITH ALL THE AGONY A PROSPECT OF INSTANT DEATH COULD CROWD INTO ME
6035-58142-0035 THERE WOULD BE SEVENTY FIVE POSTMASTERS IN DANBURY TO DAY INSTEAD OF ONE I GOT HIM OUT FINALLY AND THEN HE WAS QUIET ENOUGH AND I TOOK HIM UP ALONGSIDE THE FENCE AND GOT ON HIM HE STOPPED AN INSTANT
6035-58142-0036 ONE BRIEF INSTANT AND THEN TORE OFF DOWN THE ROAD AT A FRIGHTFUL SPEED I LAY DOWN ON HIM AND CLASPED MY HANDS TIGHTLY AROUND HIS NECK AND THOUGHT OF MY HOME
6035-58142-0037 WHEN WE GOT TO THE STABLE I WAS CONFIDENT HE WOULD STOP BUT HE DIDN'T HE DROVE STRAIGHT AT THE DOOR IT WAS A LOW DOOR JUST HIGH ENOUGH TO PERMIT HIM TO GO IN AT LIGHTNING SPEED BUT THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR ME
6035-58142-0038 I SAW IF I STRUCK THAT STABLE THE STRUGGLE WOULD BE A VERY BRIEF ONE I THOUGHT THIS ALL OVER IN AN INSTANT AND THEN SPREADING PUT MY ARMS AND LEGS EMITTED A SCREAM AND THE NEXT MOMENT I WAS
6035-58142-0039 BOUNDING ABOUT IN THE FILTH OF THAT STABLE YARD ALL THIS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND AS STIVER'S HORSE WENT UP INTO THE AIR IT FRIGHTENED MISSUS PERKINS DREADFULLY WHY YOU OLD FOOL SHE SAID
6035-58142-0040 WHY DON'T YOU GET RID OF HIM HOW CAN I SAID I IN DESPERATION WHY THERE ARE A THOUSAND WAYS SAID SHE THIS IS JUST LIKE A WOMAN HOW DIFFERENTLY A STATESMAN WOULD HAVE ANSWERED
6035-58142-0041 BUT I COULD THINK OF ONLY TWO WAYS TO DISPOSE OF THE BEAST I COULD EITHER SWALLOW HIM WHERE HE STOOD AND THEN SIT DOWN ON HIM OR I COULD CRAWL INSIDE OF HIM AND KICK HIM TO DEATH
6035-58142-0042 AND THEN HE TURNED ABOUT AND KICKING ME FULL OF MUD SHOT FOR THE GATE
6035-58142-0043 WITH TWO OF MISSUS PERKINS GARMENTS WHICH HE HASTILY SNATCHED FROM THE LINE FLOATING OVER HIS NECK IN A VERY PICTURESQUE MANNER SO I WAS AFTERWARDS TOLD
