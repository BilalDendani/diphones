6189-64708-0000 THEIR MOTHER WAS DEAD AND THEIR FATHER HAD MARRIED AGAIN A WOMAN WHO WAS MOST UNKIND AND CRUEL TO THEM ONE DAY THE BOY TOOK HIS SISTER'S HAND AND SAID TO HER DEAR LITTLE SISTER
6189-64708-0001 SINCE OUR MOTHER DIED WE HAVE NOT HAD ONE HAPPY HOUR OUR STEPMOTHER GIVES US DRY HARD CRUSTS FOR DINNER AND SUPPER SHE OFTEN KNOCKS US ABOUT AND THREATENS TO KICK US OUT OF THE HOUSE
6189-64708-0002 EVEN THE LITTLE DOGS UNDER THE TABLE FARE BETTER THAN WE DO FOR SHE OFTEN THROWS THEM NICE PIECES TO EAT HEAVEN PITY US OH IF OUR DEAR MOTHER KNEW COME LET US GO OUT INTO THE WIDE WORLD
6189-64708-0003 SO THEY WENT OUT AND WANDERED OVER FIELDS AND MEADOWS THE WHOLE DAY TILL EVENING AT LAST THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A LARGE FOREST IT BEGAN TO RAIN AND THE LITTLE SISTER SAID SEE BROTHER
6189-64708-0004 HEAVEN AND OUR HEARTS WEEP TOGETHER AT LAST TIRED OUT WITH HUNGER AND SORROW AND THE LONG JOURNEY THEY CREPT INTO A HOLLOW TREE LAID THEMSELVES DOWN AND SLEPT TILL MORNING WHEN THEY AWOKE
6189-64708-0005 THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE HEAVENS AND SHONE BRIGHTLY INTO THE HOLLOW TREE SO THEY LEFT THEIR PLACE OF SHELTER AND WANDERED AWAY IN SEARCH OF WATER OH I AM SO THIRSTY SAID THE BOY
6189-64708-0006 IF WE COULD ONLY FIND A BROOK OR A STREAM HE STOPPED TO LISTEN AND SAID STAY I THINK I HEAR A RUNNING STREAM SO HE TOOK HIS SISTER BY THE HAND AND THEY RAN TOGETHER TO FIND IT
6189-64708-0007 NOW THE STEPMOTHER OF THESE POOR CHILDREN WAS A WICKED WITCH SHE HAD SEEN THE CHILDREN GO AWAY AND FOLLOWING THEM CAUTIOUSLY LIKE A SNAKE HAD BEWITCHED ALL THE SPRINGS AND STREAMS IN THE FOREST
6189-64708-0008 THE PLEASANT TRICKLING OF A BROOK OVER THE PEBBLES WAS HEARD BY THE CHILDREN AS THEY REACHED IT AND THE BOY WAS JUST STOOPING TO DRINK WHEN THE SISTER HEARD IN THE BABBLING OF THE BROOK WHOEVER DRINKS OF ME A TIGER SOON WILL BE
6189-64708-0009 THEN SHE CRIED QUICKLY STAY BROTHER STAY DO NOT DRINK OR YOU WILL BECOME A WILD BEAST AND TEAR ME TO PIECES THIRSTY AS HE WAS THE BROTHER CONQUERED HIS DESIRE TO DRINK AT HER WORDS AND SAID DEAR SISTER
6189-64708-0010 I WILL WAIT TILL WE COME TO A SPRING SO THEY WANDERED FARTHER BUT AS THEY APPROACHED SHE HEARD IN THE BUBBLING SPRING THE WORDS WHO DRINKS OF ME A WOLF WILL BE BROTHER I PRAY YOU DO NOT DRINK OF THIS BROOK
6189-64708-0011 YOU WILL BE CHANGED INTO A WOLF AND DEVOUR ME AGAIN THE BROTHER DENIED HIMSELF AND PROMISED TO WAIT BUT HE SAID AT THE NEXT STREAM I MUST DRINK SAY WHAT YOU WILL MY THIRST IS SO GREAT
6189-64708-0012 NOT FAR OFF RAN A PRETTY STREAMLET LOOKING CLEAR AND BRIGHT BUT HERE ALSO IN ITS MURMURING WATERS THE SISTER HEARD THE WORDS WHO DARES TO DRINK OF ME TURNED TO A STAG WILL BE DEAR BROTHER DO NOT DRINK
6189-64708-0013 SHE BEGAN BUT SHE WAS TOO LATE FOR HER BROTHER HAD ALREADY KNELT BY THE STREAM TO DRINK AND AS THE FIRST DROP OF WATER TOUCHED HIS LIPS HE BECAME A FAWN HOW THE LITTLE SISTER WEPT OVER THE ENCHANTED BROTHER
6189-64708-0014 AND THE FAWN WEPT ALSO HE DID NOT RUN AWAY BUT STAYED CLOSE TO HER AND AT LAST SHE SAID STAND STILL DEAR FAWN DON'T FEAR I MUST TAKE CARE OF YOU BUT I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU
6189-64708-0015 SO SHE UNTIED HER LITTLE GOLDEN GARTER AND FASTENED IT ROUND THE NECK OF THE FAWN THEN SHE GATHERED SOME SOFT GREEN RUSHES AND BRAIDED THEM INTO A SOFT STRING WHICH SHE FASTENED TO THE FAWN'S GOLDEN COLLAR
6189-64708-0016 AND THEN LED HIM AWAY INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE FOREST AFTER WANDERING ABOUT FOR SOME TIME THEY AT LAST FOUND A LITTLE DESERTED HUT AND THE SISTER WAS OVERJOYED FOR SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD FORM A NICE SHELTER FOR THEM BOTH
6189-64708-0017 SO SHE LED THE FAWN IN AND THEN WENT OUT ALONE TO GATHER MOSS AND DRIED LEAVES TO MAKE HIM A SOFT BED EVERY MORNING SHE WENT OUT TO GATHER DRIED ROOTS NUTS AND BERRIES FOR HER OWN FOOD AND SWEET FRESH GRASS FOR THE FAWN
6189-64708-0018 WHICH HE ATE OUT OF HER HAND AND THE POOR LITTLE ANIMAL WENT OUT WITH HER AND PLAYED ABOUT AS HAPPY AS THE DAY WAS LONG WHEN EVENING CAME AND THE POOR SISTER FELT TIRED
6189-64708-0019 SHE WOULD KNEEL DOWN AND SAY HER PRAYERS AND THEN LAY HER DELICATE HEAD ON THE FAWN'S BACK WHICH WAS A SOFT WARM PILLOW ON WHICH SHE COULD SLEEP PEACEFULLY
6189-64708-0020 AFTER THEY HAD BEEN ALONE IN THE FOREST FOR SOME TIME AND THE LITTLE SISTER HAD GROWN A LOVELY MAIDEN AND THE FAWN A LARGE STAG A NUMEROUS HUNTING PARTY CAME TO THE FOREST AND AMONGST THEM THE KING OF THE COUNTRY
6189-64708-0021 THE SOUNDING HORN THE BARKING OF THE DOGS THE HOLLOA OF THE HUNTSMEN RESOUNDED THROUGH THE FOREST AND WERE HEARD BY THE STAG WHO BECAME EAGER TO JOIN HIS COMPANIONS OH DEAR HE SAID DO LET ME GO AND SEE THE HUNT
6189-64708-0022 I CANNOT RESTRAIN MYSELF AND HE BEGGED SO HARD THAT AT LAST SHE RELUCTANTLY CONSENTED BUT REMEMBER SHE SAID I MUST LOCK THE COTTAGE DOOR AGAINST THOSE HUNTSMEN
6189-64708-0023 SO WHEN YOU COME BACK IN THE EVENING AND KNOCK I SHALL NOT ADMIT YOU UNLESS YOU SAY DEAR LITTLE SISTER LET ME IN HE BOUNDED OFF AS SHE SPOKE SCARCELY STOPPING TO LISTEN
6189-64708-0024 HE HAD NOT RUN FAR WHEN THE KING'S CHIEF HUNTER CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL AND STARTED OFF IN CHASE OF HIM BUT IT WAS NO EASY MATTER TO OVERTAKE SUCH RAPID FOOTSTEPS ONCE WHEN HE THOUGHT HE HAD HIM SAFE
6189-64708-0025 THE FAWN SPRANG OVER THE BUSHES AND DISAPPEARED AS IT WAS NOW NEARLY DARK HE RAN UP TO THE LITTLE COTTAGE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND CRIED DEAR LITTLE SISTER LET ME IN THE DOOR WAS INSTANTLY OPENED
6189-64708-0026 AND OH HOW GLAD HIS SISTER WAS TO SEE HIM SAFELY RESTING ON HIS SOFT PLEASANT BED A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS THE HUNTSMEN WERE AGAIN IN THE FOREST AND WHEN THE FAWN HEARD THE HOLLOA HE COULD NOT REST IN PEACE
6189-64708-0027 BUT BEGGED HIS SISTER AGAIN TO LET HIM GO SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND SAID I WILL LET YOU GO THIS TIME BUT PRAY DO NOT FORGET TO SAY WHAT I TOLD YOU WHEN YOU RETURN THIS EVENING
6189-64708-0028 POINTED IT OUT TO THE KING AND THEY DETERMINED TO HUNT IT THEY CHASED HIM WITH ALL THEIR SKILL TILL THE EVENING BUT HE WAS TOO LIGHT AND NIMBLE FOR THEM TO CATCH TILL A SHOT WOUNDED HIM SLIGHTLY IN THE FOOT SO THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO HIDE HIMSELF IN THE BUSHES
6189-64708-0029 AND AFTER THE HUNTSMEN WERE GONE LIMP SLOWLY HOME ONE OF THEM HOWEVER DETERMINED TO FOLLOW HIM AT A DISTANCE AND DISCOVER WHERE HE WENT WHAT WAS HIS SURPRISE AT SEEING HIM GO UP TO A DOOR AND KNOCK AND TO HEAR HIM SAY
6189-64708-0030 DEAR LITTLE SISTER LET ME IN THE DOOR WAS ONLY OPENED A LITTLE WAY AND QUICKLY SHUT BUT THE HUNTSMAN HAD SEEN ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM FULL OF WONDER WHEN HE RETURNED AND DESCRIBED TO THE KING WHAT HE HAD SEEN
6189-64708-0031 WE WILL HAVE ONE MORE CHASE TO MORROW SAID THE KING AND DISCOVER THIS MYSTERY IN THE MEANTIME THE LOVING SISTER WAS TERRIBLY ALARMED AT FINDING THE STAG'S FOOT WOUNDED AND BLEEDING SHE QUICKLY WASHED OFF THE BLOOD
6189-64708-0032 AND AFTER BATHING THE WOUND PLACED HEALING HERBS ON IT AND SAID LIE DOWN ON YOUR BED DEAR FAWN AND THE WOUND WILL SOON HEAL IF YOU REST YOUR FOOT IN THE MORNING THE WOUND WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAT THE FAWN FELT THE FOOT ALMOST AS STRONG AS EVER
6189-64708-0033 AND SO WHEN HE AGAIN HEARD THE HOLLOA OF THE HUNTERS HE COULD NOT REST OH DEAR SISTER I MUST GO ONCE MORE IT WILL BE EASY FOR ME TO AVOID THE HUNTERS NOW AND MY FOOT FEELS QUITE WELL
6189-64708-0034 THEY WILL NOT HUNT ME UNLESS THEY SEE ME RUNNING AND I DON'T MEAN TO DO THAT BUT HIS SISTER WEPT AND BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO IF THEY KILL YOU DEAR FAWN I SHALL BE HERE ALONE IN THE FOREST FORSAKEN BY THE WHOLE WORLD
6189-64708-0035 AND I SHALL DIE OF GRIEF HE SAID IF I REMAIN HERE LISTENING TO THE HUNTER'S HORN SO AT LENGTH HIS SISTER WITH A HEAVY HEART SET HIM FREE AND HE BOUNDED AWAY JOYFULLY INTO THE FOREST
6189-64708-0036 AS SOON AS THE KING CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM HE SAID TO THE HUNTSMEN FOLLOW THAT STAG ABOUT BUT DON'T HURT HIM SO THEY HUNTED HIM ALL DAY BUT AT THE APPROACH OF SUNSET THE KING SAID TO THE HUNTER WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE FAWN THE DAY BEFORE COME
6189-64708-0037 AND SHOW ME THE LITTLE COTTAGE SO THEY WENT TOGETHER AND WHEN THE KING SAW IT HE SENT HIS COMPANION HOME AND WENT ON ALONE SO QUICKLY THAT HE ARRIVED THERE BEFORE THE FAWN AND GOING UP TO THE LITTLE DOOR KNOCKED AND SAID SOFTLY
6189-64708-0038 DEAR LITTLE SISTER LET ME IN AS THE DOOR OPENED THE KING STEPPED IN AND IN GREAT ASTONISHMENT SAW A MAIDEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN HE HAD EVER SEEN IN HIS LIFE STANDING BEFORE HIM
6189-64708-0039 BUT HOW FRIGHTENED SHE FELT TO SEE INSTEAD OF HER DEAR LITTLE FAWN A NOBLE GENTLEMAN WALK IN WITH A GOLD CROWN ON HIS HEAD HOWEVER HE APPEARED VERY FRIENDLY AND AFTER A LITTLE TALK HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO HER AND SAID
6189-64708-0040 WILT THOU GO WITH ME TO MY CASTLE AND BE MY DEAR WIFE
6189-64708-0041 I WOULD WILLINGLY BUT I CANNOT LEAVE MY DEAR FAWN HE MUST GO WITH ME WHEREVER I AM HE SHALL REMAIN WITH YOU AS LONG AS YOU LIVE REPLIED THE KING AND I WILL NEVER ASK YOU TO FORSAKE HIM WHILE THEY WERE TALKING
6189-64708-0042 THE FAWN CAME BOUNDING IN LOOKING QUITE WELL AND HAPPY THEN HIS SISTER FASTENED THE STRING OF RUSHES TO HIS COLLAR TOOK IT IN HER HAND AND LED HIM AWAY FROM THE COTTAGE IN THE WOOD TO WHERE THE KING'S BEAUTIFUL HORSE WAITED FOR HIM
6189-64708-0043 THE KING PLACED THE MAIDEN BEFORE HIM ON HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY TO HIS CASTLE THE FAWN FOLLOWING BY THEIR SIDE SOON AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE WAS CELEBRATED WITH GREAT SPLENDOUR AND THE FAWN WAS TAKEN THE GREATEST CARE OF
6189-64708-0044 AND PLAYED WHERE HE PLEASED OR ROAMED ABOUT THE CASTLE GROUNDS IN HAPPINESS AND SAFETY IN THE MEANTIME THE WICKED STEPMOTHER WHO HAD CAUSED THESE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE SUCH MISERY
6189-64708-0045 SUPPOSED THAT THE SISTER HAD BEEN DEVOURED BY WILD BEASTS AND THAT THE FAWN HAD BEEN HUNTED TO DEATH THEREFORE WHEN SHE HEARD OF THEIR HAPPINESS
6189-64708-0046 SUCH ENVY AND MALICE AROSE IN HER HEART THAT SHE COULD FIND NO REST TILL SHE HAD TRIED TO DESTROY IT SHE AND HER UGLY DAUGHTER CAME TO THE CASTLE WHEN THE QUEEN HAD A LITTLE BABY
6189-64708-0047 AND ONE OF THEM PRETENDED TO BE A NURSE AND AT LAST GOT THE MOTHER AND CHILD INTO THEIR POWER THEY SHUT THE QUEEN UP IN THE BATH AND TRIED TO SUFFOCATE HER AND THE OLD WOMAN PUT HER OWN UGLY DAUGHTER IN THE QUEEN'S BED
6189-64708-0048 THAT THE KING MIGHT NOT KNOW SHE WAS AWAY SHE WOULD NOT HOWEVER LET HIM SPEAK TO HER BUT PRETENDED THAT SHE MUST BE KEPT QUITE QUIET THE QUEEN ESCAPED FROM THE BATH ROOM WHERE THE WICKED OLD WOMAN HAD LOCKED HER UP BUT SHE DID NOT GO FAR
6189-64708-0049 AS SHE WANTED TO WATCH OVER HER CHILD AND THE LITTLE FAWN FOR TWO NIGHTS THE BABY'S NURSE SAW A FIGURE OF THE QUEEN COME INTO THE ROOM AND TAKE UP HER BABY AND NURSE IT THEN SHE TOLD THE KING
6189-64708-0050 AND HE DETERMINED TO WATCH HIMSELF THE OLD STEPMOTHER WHO ACTED AS NURSE TO HER UGLY DAUGHTER WHOM SHE TRIED TO MAKE THE KING BELIEVE WAS HIS WIFE HAD SAID THAT THE QUEEN WAS TOO WEAK TO SEE HIM AND NEVER LEFT HER ROOM
6189-64708-0051 THERE CANNOT BE TWO QUEENS SAID THE KING TO HIMSELF SO TO NIGHT I WILL WATCH IN THE NURSERY AS SOON AS THE FIGURE CAME IN AND TOOK UP HER BABY HE SAW IT WAS HIS REAL WIFE AND CAUGHT HER IN HIS ARMS SAYING
6189-64708-0052 YOU ARE MY OWN BELOVED WIFE AS BEAUTIFUL AS EVER THE WICKED WITCH HAD THROWN HER INTO A TRANCE HOPING SHE WOULD DIE AND THAT THE KING WOULD THEN MARRY HER DAUGHTER BUT ON THE KING SPEAKING TO HER THE SPELL WAS BROKEN
6189-64708-0053 THE QUEEN TOLD THE KING HOW CRUELLY SHE HAD BEEN TREATED BY HER STEPMOTHER AND ON HEARING THIS HE BECAME VERY ANGRY AND HAD THE WITCH AND HER DAUGHTER BROUGHT TO JUSTICE THEY WERE BOTH SENTENCED TO DIE
6189-64708-0054 THE DAUGHTER TO BE DEVOURED BY WILD BEASTS AND THE MOTHER TO BE BURNT ALIVE NO SOONER HOWEVER WAS SHE REDUCED TO ASHES THAN THE CHARM WHICH HELD THE QUEEN'S BROTHER IN THE FORM OF A STAG WAS BROKEN
6189-64708-0055 HE RECOVERED HIS OWN NATURAL SHAPE AND APPEARED BEFORE THEM A TALL HANDSOME YOUNG MAN
