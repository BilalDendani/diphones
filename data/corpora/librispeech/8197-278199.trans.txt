8197-278199-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT THE FIRST STAGE ON THE JOURNEY HOME JOSEPH WILMOT OBEYED HIS OLD MASTER AND ORDERED A VERY EXCELLENT LUNCHEON WHICH WAS SERVED IN THE BEST STYLE OF THE DOLPHIN
8197-278199-0001 AND A SOJOURN AT THE DOLPHIN IS ALMOST A RECOMPENSE FOR THE PAINS AND PENALTIES OF THE VOYAGE HOME FROM INDIA MISTER DUNBAR FROM THE SUBLIME HEIGHT OF HIS OWN GRANDEUR
8197-278199-0002 STOOPED TO BE VERY FRIENDLY WITH HIS OLD VALET AND INSISTED UPON JOSEPH'S SITTING DOWN WITH HIM AT THE WELL SPREAD TABLE BUT ALTHOUGH THE ANGLO INDIAN DID AMPLE JUSTICE TO THE LUNCHEON AND WASHED DOWN A SPATCHCOCK AND A LOBSTER SALAD WITH SEVERAL GLASSES OF ICED MOSELLE
8197-278199-0003 AND SAT FOR THE BEST PART OF THE TIME CRUMBLING HIS BREAD IN A STRANGE ABSENT MANNER AND WATCHING HIS COMPANION'S FACE
8197-278199-0004 AND THEN IN A CONSTRAINED HALF MECHANICAL WAY WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXCITED THE WONDER OF ANY ONE LESS SUPREMELY INDIFFERENT THAN HENRY DUNBAR TO THE FEELINGS OF HIS FELLOW CREATURES THE ANGLO INDIAN FINISHED HIS LUNCHEON LEFT THE TABLE AND WALKED TO THE WINDOW
8197-278199-0005 BUT JOSEPH WILMOT STILL SAT WITH A FULL GLASS BEFORE HIM THE SPARKLING BUBBLES HAD VANISHED FROM THE CLEAR AMBER WINE
8197-278199-0006 HE SEEMED TO HAVE NO APPRECIATION OF THE VINTAGE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD BENT AND HIS ELBOW ON HIS KNEE BROODING BROODING BROODING HENRY DUNBAR AMUSED HIMSELF FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES LOOKING OUT AT THE BUSY STREET
8197-278199-0007 AND THEN TURNED AWAY FROM THE WINDOW AND LOOKED AT HIS OLD VALET HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED FIVE AND THIRTY YEARS AGO TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THE MAN AND TO MAKE A CONFIDANT AND COMPANION OF HIM AND HE FELL INTO THE SAME MANNER NOW NATURALLY AS IF THE FIVE AND THIRTY YEARS HAD NEVER BEEN
8197-278199-0008 AS IF JOSEPH WILMOT HAD NEVER BEEN WRONGED BY HIM HE FELL INTO THE OLD WAY AND TREATED HIS COMPANION WITH THAT HAUGHTY AFFABILITY WHICH A MONARCH MAY BE SUPPOSED TO EXHIBIT TOWARDS HIS PRIME FAVOURITE DRINK YOUR WINE WILMOT HE EXCLAIMED
8197-278199-0009 DON'T SIT MEDITATING THERE AS IF YOU WERE A GREAT SPECULATOR BROODING OVER THE STAGNATION OF THE MONEY MARKET I WANT BRIGHT LOOKS MAN TO WELCOME ME BACK TO MY NATIVE COUNTRY I'VE SEEN DARK FACES ENOUGH OUT YONDER AND I WANT TO SEE SMILING AND PLEASANTER FACES HERE
8197-278199-0010 YOU LOOK AS BLACK AS IF YOU HAD COMMITTED A MURDER OR WERE PLOTTING ONE THE OUTCAST SMILED I'VE SO MUCH REASON TO LOOK CHEERFUL HAVEN'T I HE SAID
8197-278199-0011 I'VE SUCH A PLEASANT LIFE BEFORE ME AND SUCH AGREEABLE RECOLLECTIONS TO LOOK BACK UPON A MAN'S MEMORY SEEMS TO ME LIKE A BOOK OF PICTURES THAT HE MUST BE CONTINUALLY LOOKING AT WHETHER HE WILL OR NOT AND IF THE PICTURES ARE HORRIBLE IF HE SHUDDERS AS HE LOOKS AT THEM
8197-278199-0012 IF THE SIGHT OF THEM IS WORSE THAN THE PAIN OF DEATH TO HIM HE MUST LOOK NEVERTHELESS I READ A STORY THE OTHER DAY AT LEAST MY GIRL WAS READING IT TO ME POOR CHILD SHE TRIES TO SOFTEN ME WITH THESE THINGS SOMETIMES AND THE MAN WHO WROTE THE STORY SAID IT WAS WELL FOR THE MOST MISERABLE OF US TO PRAY
8197-278199-0013 LORD KEEP MY MEMORY GREEN BUT WHAT IF THE MEMORY IS A RECORD OF CRIME MISTER DUNBAR CAN WE PRAY THAT THOSE MEMORIES MAY BE KEPT GREEN WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER TO PRAY THAT OUR BRAINS AND HEARTS MAY WITHER LEAVING US NO POWER TO LOOK BACK UPON THE PAST
8197-278199-0014 EVERY DAY AND EVERY HOUR I HAVE REMEMBERED IT MY MEMORY IS AS FRESH TO DAY AS IT WAS FOUR AND THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN MY WRONGS WERE ONLY A TWELVEMONTH OLD
8197-278199-0015 HE HAD NOT LOOKED AT THE ANGLO INDIAN HE HAD NOT CHANGED HIS ATTITUDE HE HAD SPOKEN WITH HIS HEAD STILL BENT AND HIS EYES FIXED UPON THE GROUND MISTER DUNBAR HAD GONE BACK TO THE WINDOW AND HAD RESUMED HIS CONTEMPLATION OF THE STREET
8197-278199-0016 BUT HE TURNED ROUND WITH A GESTURE OF ANGRY IMPATIENCE AS JOSEPH WILMOT FINISHED SPEAKING NOW LISTEN TO ME WILMOT HE SAID
8197-278199-0017 IF THE FIRM IN SAINT GUNDOLPH LANE SENT YOU DOWN HERE TO ANNOY AND INSULT ME DIRECTLY I SET FOOT UPON BRITISH GROUND THEY HAVE CHOSEN A VERY NICE WAY OF TESTIFYING THEIR RESPECT FOR THEIR CHIEF AND THEY HAVE MADE A MISTAKE WHICH THEY SHALL REPENT HAVING MADE SOONER OR LATER
8197-278199-0018 IF YOU THINK TO MAKE A FOOL OF ME BY ANY MAUDLIN SENTIMENTALITY YOU MAKE A STILL GREATER MISTAKE I GIVE YOU FAIR WARNING IF YOU EXPECT ANY ADVANTAGE FROM ME YOU MUST MAKE YOURSELF AGREEABLE TO ME
8197-278199-0019 IF YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL YOU CAN STAY IF YOU DON'T CHOOSE TO DO SO THE SOONER YOU LEAVE THIS ROOM THE BETTER FOR YOURSELF IF YOU WISH TO ESCAPE THE HUMILIATION OF BEING TURNED OUT BY THE WAITER AT THE END OF THIS SPEECH JOSEPH WILMOT LOOKED UP FOR THE FIRST TIME
8197-278199-0020 HE WAS VERY PALE AND THERE WERE STRANGE HARD LINES ABOUT HIS COMPRESSED LIPS AND A NEW LIGHT IN HIS EYES I AM A POOR WEAK FOOL HE SAID QUIETLY
8197-278199-0021 BUT I'LL NOT ANNOY YOU AGAIN I'M QUITE READY TO MAKE MYSELF USEFUL IN ANY WAY YOU MAY REQUIRE
8197-278199-0022 HENRY DUNBAR STUDIED IT THERE IS NO EXPRESS BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT HE SAID AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT TRAVELLING BY A SLOW TRAIN WHAT AM I TO DO WITH MYSELF IN THE INTERIM HE WAS SILENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS TURNING OVER THE LEAVES OF BRADSHAW'S GUIDE AND THINKING
8197-278199-0023 HOW FAR IS IT FROM HERE TO WINCHESTER HE ASKED PRESENTLY TEN MILES OR THEREABOUTS I BELIEVE JOSEPH ANSWERED TEN MILES VERY WELL THEN WILMOT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO I'VE A FRIEND IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF WINCHESTER AN OLD COLLEGE COMPANION
8197-278199-0024 IF YOU'LL ORDER A CARRIAGE AND PAIR TO BE GOT READY IMMEDIATELY WE'LL DRIVE OVER TO WINCHESTER I'LL GO AND SEE MY OLD FRIEND MICHAEL MARSTON WE'LL DINE AT THE GEORGE AND GO UP TO LONDON BY THE EXPRESS WHICH LEAVES WINCHESTER AT A QUARTER PAST TEN GO AND ORDER THE CARRIAGE AND LOSE NO TIME ABOUT IT THAT'S A GOOD FELLOW
8197-278199-0025 IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK WHEN THE CARRIAGE DROVE AWAY FROM THE ENTRANCE OF THE DOLPHIN HOTEL IT WANTED FIVE MINUTES TO FOUR WHEN MISTER DUNBAR AND HIS COMPANION ENTERED THE HANDSOME HALL OF THE GEORGE THROUGHOUT THE DRIVE THE BANKER HAD BEEN IN VERY EXCELLENT SPIRITS SMOKING CHEROOTS AND ADMIRING THE LOVELY ENGLISH LANDSCAPE
8197-278199-0026 THE SPREADING PASTURES THE GLIMPSES OF WOODLAND THE HILLS BEYOND THE GREY CATHEDRAL CITY PURPLE IN THE DISTANCE HE HAD TALKED A GOOD DEAL MAKING HIMSELF VERY FAMILIAR WITH HIS HUMBLE FRIEND BUT HE HAD NOT TALKED SO MUCH OR SO LOUDLY AS JOSEPH WILMOT
8197-278199-0027 ALL GLOOMY MEMORIES SEEMED TO HAVE MELTED AWAY FROM THIS MAN'S MIND HIS FORMER MOODY SILENCE HAD BEEN SUCCEEDED BY A MANNER THAT WAS ALMOST UNNATURALLY GAY A CLOSE OBSERVER WOULD HAVE DETECTED THAT HIS LAUGH WAS A LITTLE FORCED HIS LOUDEST MERRIMENT WANTING IN GENIALITY
8197-278199-0028 PEOPLE IN CALCUTTA WHO COURTED AND ADMIRED THE RICH BANKER HAD BEEN WONT TO PRAISE THE ARISTOCRATIC EASE OF HIS MANNER WHICH WAS NOT OFTEN DISTURBED BY ANY VULGAR DEMONSTRATION OF HIS OWN EMOTIONS AND VERY RARELY RUFFLED BY ANY SYMPATHY WITH THE JOYS OR PITY FOR THE SORROWS OF HIS FELLOW CREATURES
8197-278199-0029 HIS COMPANION'S READY WIT AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD THE VERY WORST PART OF THE WORLD UNHAPPILY AMUSED THE LANGUID ANGLO INDIAN AND BY THE TIME THE TRAVELLERS REACHED WINCHESTER THEY WERE ON EXCELLENT TERMS WITH EACH OTHER
8197-278199-0030 JOSEPH WILMOT WAS THOROUGHLY AT HOME WITH HIS PATRON AND AS THE TWO MEN WERE DRESSED IN THE SAME FASHION AND HAD PRETTY MUCH THE SAME NONCHALANCE OF MANNER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR A STRANGER TO HAVE DISCOVERED WHICH WAS THE SERVANT AND WHICH THE MASTER ONE OF THEM ORDERED DINNER FOR EIGHT O'CLOCK
8197-278199-0031 THE BEST DINNER THE HOUSE COULD PROVIDE THE LUGGAGE WAS TAKEN UP TO A PRIVATE ROOM AND THE TWO MEN WALKED AWAY FROM THE HOTEL ARM IN ARM THEY WALKED UNDER THE SHADOW OF A LOW STONE COLONNADE AND THEN TURNED ASIDE BY THE MARKET PLACE AND MADE THEIR WAY INTO THE PRECINCTS OF THE CATHEDRAL
8197-278199-0032 THERE ARE QUAINT OLD COURTYARDS AND SHADOWY QUADRANGLES HEREABOUTS THERE ARE PLEASANT GARDENS WHERE THE FLOWERS SEEM TO GROW BRIGHTER IN THE SANCTIFIED SHADE THAN OTHER FLOWERS THAT FLAUNT IN THE UNHALLOWED SUNSHINE THERE ARE LOW OLD FASHIONED HOUSES WITH TUDOR WINDOWS AND PONDEROUS PORCHES
8197-278199-0033 GREY GABLES CROWNED WITH YELLOW STONE MOSS HIGH GARDEN WALLS QUEER NOOKS AND CORNERS DEEP WINDOW SEATS IN PAINTED ORIELS GREAT OAKEN BEAMS SUPPORTING LOW DARK CEILINGS HEAVY CLUSTERS OF CHIMNEYS HALF BORNE DOWN BY THE WEIGHT OF THE IVY THAT CLINGS ABOUT THEM
8197-278199-0034 AND OVER ALL THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT CATHEDRAL BROODS LIKE A SHELTERING WING PRESERVING THE COOL QUIET OF THESE COSY SANCTUARIES BEYOND THIS HOLY SHELTER
8197-278199-0035 NOW HIDING IN DIM GROVES OF SPREADING ELMS NOW CREEPING FROM THE DARKNESS WITH A MURMURING VOICE AND STEALTHY GLIDING MOTION TO CHANGE ITS VERY NATURE AND BECOME THE NOISIEST BROOK THAT EVER BABBLED OVER SUNLIT PEBBLES ON ITS WAY TO THE BLUE SEA
8197-278199-0036 IN ONE OF THE GREY STONE QUADRANGLES CLOSE UNDER THE CATHEDRAL WALL THE TWO MEN STILL ARM IN ARM STOPPED TO MAKE AN INQUIRY ABOUT MISTER MICHAEL MARSTON OF THE FERNS SAINT CROSS
8197-278199-0037 ALAS BEN BOLT IT IS A FINE THING TO SAIL AWAY TO FOREIGN SHORES AND PROSPER THERE BUT IT IS NOT SO PLEASANT TO COME HOME AND HEAR THAT ALICE IS DEAD AND BURIED THAT OF ALL YOUR OLD COMPANIONS THERE IS ONLY ONE LEFT TO GREET YOU
8197-278199-0038 MISTER MICHAEL MARSTON HAD BEEN DEAD MORE THAN TEN YEARS HIS WIDOW AN ELDERLY LADY WAS STILL LIVING AT THE FERNS THIS WAS THE INFORMATION WHICH THE TWO MEN OBTAINED FROM A VERGER WHOM THEY FOUND PROWLING ABOUT THE QUADRANGLE VERY LITTLE WAS SAID
8197-278199-0039 ONE OF THE MEN ASKED THE NECESSARY QUESTIONS BUT NEITHER OF THEM EXPRESSED EITHER REGRET OR SURPRISE
8197-278199-0040 THE VERGER WHO WAS ELDERLY AND SLOW CALLED AFTER THEM IN A FEEBLE VOICE AS THEY WENT AWAY MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO SEE THE CATHEDRAL GENTLEMEN IT'S WELL WORTH SEEING BUT HE RECEIVED NO ANSWER
8197-278199-0041 UNDER THE SHADOW OF A MOSS GROWN WALL ACROSS A PATCH OF MEADOW LAND AND AWAY INTO THE HOLY QUIET OF A GROVE A SERENE STILLNESS REIGNED BENEATH THE SHELTER OF THE SPREADING BRANCHES THE WINDING STREAMLET RIPPLED ALONG AMIDST WILD FLOWERS AND TREMBLING RUSHES
8197-278199-0042 THE GROUND BENEATH THE FEET OF THESE TWO IDLE WANDERERS WAS A SOFT BED OF MOSS AND RARELY TRODDEN GRASS IT WAS A LONELY PLACE THIS GROVE FOR IT LAY BETWEEN THE MEADOWS AND THE HIGH ROAD FEEBLE OLD PENSIONERS FROM SAINT CROSS CAME HERE SOMETIMES BUT NOT OFTEN
8197-278199-0043 THE LOVELIEST SPOTS ON EARTH ARE THOSE WHERE MAN SELDOM COMES THIS SPOT WAS MOST LOVELY BECAUSE OF ITS SOLITUDE ONLY THE GENTLE WAVING OF THE LEAVES THE LONG MELODIOUS NOTE OF A LONELY BIRD AND THE LOW WHISPER OF THE STREAMLET BROKE THE SILENCE
