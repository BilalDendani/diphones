7839-109880-0000 THE SONG THAT TRAVELED ONE DAY WHEN ALL THE WORLD WAS GAY WITH SPRING A KING STOOD AT A WINDOW OF HIS PALACE AND LOOKED FAR OUT OVER HIS KINGDOM AND BECAUSE HIS LAND WAS FAIR TO SEE
7839-109880-0001 AND HE WAS A YOUNG KING AND HIS HEART WAS HAPPY HE MADE A SONG FOR HIMSELF AND SANG IT LOUD AND MERRILY THE HAWTHORN'S WHITE THE SUN IS BRIGHT
7839-109880-0002 AND SHE LEANED ON THE FENCE THAT DIVIDED THE TWO AND SANG WITH HIM FOR SHE WAS AS HAPPY A LASS AS EVER LIVED IN THE KING'S COUNTRY THE FARMER'S WIFE HAD GIVEN HER A GOOSE FOR HER VERY OWN THAT DAY AND THE GOOSE HAD MADE A NEST IN THE ALDER BUSHES
7839-109880-0003 THERE WAS ALREADY ONE EGG IN IT AND SOON THERE WOULD BE MORE THEN SHE WOULD SEND THEM TO MARKET AND WHEN THEY WERE SOLD SHE WOULD BUY A RIBBON FOR HER HAIR IT WAS NO WONDER THAT SHE FELT LIKE SINGING
7839-109880-0004 BECAUSE NOTHING HAD GONE AMISS AND HE WAS HOMEWARD BOUND HE SANG IT TOO THE HAWTHORN'S WHITE THE SUN IS BRIGHT
7839-109880-0005 AND NOT A BIRD THAT SINGS IN SPRING
7839-109880-0006 ON THE SAILOR'S SHIP THERE WAS A MINSTREL BOUND FOR THE KING'S COURT TO SING ON MAY DAY AND THE MINSTREL LEARNED THE SONG FROM THE SAILOR HE WAS A YOUNG MINSTREL AND VERY PROUD TO SING AT THE KING'S FESTIVAL
7839-109880-0007 SO WHEN IT WAS HIS TURN AND HE STOOD BEFORE THE THRONE HE COULD THINK OF NO BETTER SONG TO SING THAN
7839-109880-0008 NOW THE KING HAD BEEN SO BUSY ABOUT THE AFFAIRS OF HIS KINGDOM DECIDING THIS QUESTION AND THAT SENDING MESSENGERS HERE AND THERE AND LISTENING TO ONE AND ANOTHER AS ALL KINGS MUST DO
7839-109880-0009 THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE SONG WHICH HE HAD MADE BUT WHEN HE HEARD THE MINSTREL IT ALL CAME BACK TO HIM AND THEN HE WAS PUZZLED GOOD MINSTREL SAID HE TEN GOLDEN GUINEAS I WILL GIVE YOU FOR YOUR SONG AND TO THE TEN WILL ADD TEN MORE
7839-109880-0010 IF YOU WILL TELL ME WHERE YOU LEARNED IT AN EASY MATTER THAT SAID THE MINSTREL THE SAILOR WHO RIDES IN YON WHITE SHIP IN YOUR HARBOR TAUGHT IT TO ME THE SOLDIER WHO EVEN NOW STANDS GUARD AT YOUR MAJESTY'S GATE GAVE ME THE SONG
7839-109880-0011 SAID THE SAILOR WHEN HE WAS ASKED I HAD IT FROM THE CHAPMAN WHO TRAVELS ON THE KING'S HIGHWAY SAID THE SOLDIER I HEARD THE LITTLE GOOSE GIRL SING IT SAID THE CHAPMAN WHEN THEY FOUND HIM TIS ROBIN PLOUGHBOY'S SONG
7839-109880-0012 LAUGHED THE GOOSE GIRL GO ASK HIM ABOUT IT THE KING SANG IT FIRST AND I NEXT SAID THE PLOUGHBOY THEN THE KING KNEW THAT HE HAD MADE A GOOD SONG THAT EVERYBODY WITH A HAPPY HEART MIGHT SING
