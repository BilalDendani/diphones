1846-144458-0000 CHAPTER NINE I HAVE A MEMORABLE BIRTHDAY
1846-144458-0001 I REMEMBER NOTHING HE WAS GOING AWAY AT THE END OF THE HALF YEAR IF NOT SOONER AND WAS MORE SPIRITED AND INDEPENDENT THAN BEFORE IN MY EYES AND THEREFORE MORE ENGAGING THAN BEFORE BUT BEYOND THIS I REMEMBER NOTHING
1846-144458-0002 AND TO EXIST ALONE IT IS EVEN DIFFICULT FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A GAP OF FULL TWO MONTHS BETWEEN MY RETURN TO SALEM HOUSE AND THE ARRIVAL OF THAT BIRTHDAY I CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE FACT WAS SO BECAUSE I KNOW IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO OTHERWISE
1846-144458-0003 HOW WELL I RECOLLECT THE KIND OF DAY IT WAS I SMELL THE FOG THAT HUNG ABOUT THE PLACE I SEE THE HOAR FROST GHOSTLY THROUGH IT I FEEL MY RIMY HAIR FALL CLAMMY ON MY CHEEK I LOOK ALONG THE DIM PERSPECTIVE OF THE SCHOOLROOM
1846-144458-0004 WITH A SPUTTERING CANDLE HERE AND THERE TO LIGHT UP THE FOGGY MORNING AND THE BREATH OF THE BOYS WREATHING AND SMOKING IN THE RAW COLD AS THEY BLOW UPON THEIR FINGERS AND TAP THEIR FEET UPON THE FLOOR IT WAS AFTER BREAKFAST AND WE HAD BEEN SUMMONED IN FROM THE PLAYGROUND
1846-144458-0005 WHEN MISTER SHARP ENTERED AND SAID DAVID COPPERFIELD IS TO GO INTO THE PARLOUR I EXPECTED A HAMPER FROM PEGGOTTY AND BRIGHTENED AT THE ORDER SOME OF THE BOYS ABOUT ME PUT IN THEIR CLAIM NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE GOOD THINGS
1846-144458-0006 ALACRITY DON'T HURRY DAVID SAID MISTER SHARP THERE'S TIME ENOUGH MY BOY DON'T HURRY I MIGHT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BY THE FEELING TONE IN WHICH HE SPOKE IF I HAD GIVEN IT A THOUGHT BUT I GAVE IT NONE UNTIL AFTERWARDS I HURRIED AWAY TO THE PARLOUR
1846-144458-0007 AND THERE I FOUND MISTER CREAKLE SITTING AT HIS BREAKFAST WITH THE CANE AND A NEWSPAPER BEFORE HIM AND MISSUS CREAKLE WITH AN OPENED LETTER IN HER HAND BUT NO HAMPER DAVID COPPERFIELD SAID MISSUS CREAKLE LEADING ME TO A SOFA AND SITTING DOWN BESIDE ME
1846-144458-0008 I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU VERY PARTICULARLY I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU MY CHILD MISTER CREAKLE AT WHOM OF COURSE I LOOKED SHOOK HIS HEAD WITHOUT LOOKING AT ME AND STOPPED UP A SIGH WITH A VERY LARGE PIECE OF BUTTERED TOAST
1846-144458-0009 YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TO KNOW HOW THE WORLD CHANGES EVERY DAY SAID MISSUS CREAKLE AND HOW THE PEOPLE IN IT PASS AWAY BUT WE ALL HAVE TO LEARN IT DAVID SOME OF US WHEN WE ARE YOUNG SOME OF US WHEN WE ARE OLD SOME OF US AT ALL TIMES OF OUR LIVES
1846-144458-0010 I LOOKED AT HER EARNESTLY WHEN YOU CAME AWAY FROM HOME AT THE END OF THE VACATION
1846-144458-0011 WERE THEY ALL WELL AFTER ANOTHER PAUSE WAS YOUR MAMA WELL I TREMBLED WITHOUT DISTINCTLY KNOWING WHY AND STILL LOOKED AT HER EARNESTLY
1846-144458-0012 BECAUSE SAID SHE I GRIEVE TO TELL YOU THAT I HEAR THIS MORNING YOUR MAMA IS VERY ILL A MIST ROSE BETWEEN MISSUS CREAKLE AND ME AND HER FIGURE SEEMED TO MOVE IN IT FOR AN INSTANT THEN I FELT THE BURNING TEARS RUN DOWN MY FACE
1846-144458-0013 AND IT WAS STEADY AGAIN SHE IS VERY DANGEROUSLY ILL SHE ADDED I KNEW ALL NOW SHE IS DEAD THERE WAS NO NEED TO TELL ME SO I HAD ALREADY BROKEN OUT INTO A DESOLATE CRY
1846-144458-0014 WHEN I COULD CRY NO MORE I BEGAN TO THINK AND THEN THE OPPRESSION ON MY BREAST WAS HEAVIEST AND MY GRIEF A DULL PAIN THAT THERE WAS NO EASE FOR AND YET MY THOUGHTS WERE IDLE NOT
1846-144458-0015 INTENT ON THE CALAMITY THAT WEIGHED UPON MY HEART BUT IDLY LOITERING NEAR IT I THOUGHT OF OUR HOUSE SHUT UP AND HUSHED I THOUGHT OF THE LITTLE BABY WHO MISSUS CREAKLE SAID HAD BEEN PINING AWAY FOR SOME TIME
1846-144458-0016 AND WHO THEY BELIEVED WOULD DIE TOO I THOUGHT OF MY FATHER'S GRAVE IN THE CHURCHYARD BY OUR HOUSE AND OF MY MOTHER LYING THERE BENEATH THE TREE I KNEW SO WELL I STOOD UPON A CHAIR WHEN I WAS LEFT ALONE AND LOOKED INTO THE GLASS TO SEE HOW RED MY EYES WERE
1846-144458-0017 I CONSIDERED AFTER SOME HOURS WERE GONE IF MY TEARS WERE REALLY HARD TO FLOW NOW AS THEY SEEMED TO BE WHAT IN CONNEXION WITH MY LOSS IT WOULD AFFECT ME MOST TO THINK OF WHEN I DREW NEAR HOME FOR I WAS GOING HOME TO THE FUNERAL
1846-144458-0018 I AM SENSIBLE OF HAVING FELT THAT A DIGNITY ATTACHED TO ME AMONG THE REST OF THE BOYS AND THAT I WAS IMPORTANT IN MY AFFLICTION IF EVER CHILD WERE STRICKEN WITH SINCERE GRIEF I WAS
1846-144458-0019 WHEN I SAW THEM GLANCING AT ME OUT OF THE WINDOWS AS THEY WENT UP TO THEIR CLASSES I FELT DISTINGUISHED AND LOOKED MORE MELANCHOLY AND WALKED SLOWER WHEN SCHOOL WAS OVER AND THEY CAME OUT AND SPOKE TO ME I FELT IT RATHER GOOD IN MYSELF NOT TO BE PROUD TO ANY OF THEM
1846-144458-0020 AND TO TAKE EXACTLY THE SAME NOTICE OF THEM ALL AS BEFORE I WAS TO GO HOME NEXT NIGHT NOT BY THE MAIL BUT BY THE HEAVY NIGHT COACH WHICH WAS CALLED THE FARMER
1846-144458-0021 AND WAS PRINCIPALLY USED BY COUNTRY PEOPLE TRAVELLING SHORT INTERMEDIATE DISTANCES UPON THE ROAD WE HAD NO STORY TELLING THAT EVENING AND TRADDLES INSISTED ON LENDING ME HIS PILLOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOOD HE THOUGHT IT WOULD DO ME FOR I HAD ONE OF MY OWN
1846-144458-0022 BUT IT WAS ALL HE HAD TO LEND POOR FELLOW EXCEPT A SHEET OF LETTER PAPER FULL OF SKELETONS AND THAT HE GAVE ME AT PARTING AS A SOOTHER OF MY SORROWS AND A CONTRIBUTION TO MY PEACE OF MIND I LEFT SALEM HOUSE UPON THE MORROW AFTERNOON
1846-144458-0023 AND DID NOT GET INTO YARMOUTH BEFORE NINE OR TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I LOOKED OUT FOR MISTER BARKIS BUT HE WAS NOT THERE AND INSTEAD OF HIM A FAT SHORT WINDED MERRY LOOKING LITTLE OLD MAN IN BLACK
1846-144458-0024 WITH RUSTY LITTLE BUNCHES OF RIBBONS AT THE KNEES OF HIS BREECHES BLACK STOCKINGS AND A BROAD BRIMMED HAT CAME PUFFING UP TO THE COACH WINDOW AND SAID MASTER COPPERFIELD YES SIR WILL YOU COME WITH ME YOUNG SIR IF YOU PLEASE HE SAID OPENING THE DOOR
1846-144458-0025 AND I SHALL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF TAKING YOU HOME I PUT MY HAND IN HIS WONDERING WHO HE WAS AND WE WALKED AWAY TO A SHOP IN A NARROW STREET ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN OMER DRAPER TAILOR
1846-144458-0026 WHICH WERE HEAPED UPON THE TABLE AND LITTLE BITS AND CUTTINGS OF WHICH WERE LITTERED ALL OVER THE FLOOR THERE WAS A GOOD FIRE IN THE ROOM AND A BREATHLESS SMELL OF WARM BLACK CRAPE I DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE SMELL WAS THEN BUT I KNOW NOW THE THREE YOUNG WOMEN
1846-144458-0027 WHO APPEARED TO BE VERY INDUSTRIOUS AND COMFORTABLE RAISED THEIR HEADS TO LOOK AT ME AND THEN WENT ON WITH THEIR WORK STITCH STITCH STITCH AT THE SAME TIME THERE CAME FROM A WORKSHOP
1846-144458-0028 A REGULAR SOUND OF HAMMERING THAT KEPT A KIND OF TUNE RAT TAT TAT RAT TAT TAT RAT TAT TAT WITHOUT ANY VARIATION WELL SAID MY CONDUCTOR TO ONE OF THE THREE YOUNG WOMEN HOW DO YOU GET ON MINNIE
1846-144458-0029 WE SHALL BE READY BY THE TRYING ON TIME SHE REPLIED GAILY WITHOUT LOOKING UP DON'T YOU BE AFRAID FATHER MISTER OMER TOOK OFF HIS BROAD BRIMMED HAT AND SAT DOWN AND PANTED HE WAS SO FAT THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO PANT SOME TIME BEFORE HE COULD SAY THAT'S RIGHT
1846-144458-0030 FATHER SAID MINNIE PLAYFULLY WHAT A PORPOISE YOU DO GROW WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS MY DEAR HE REPLIED CONSIDERING ABOUT IT I AM RATHER SO YOU ARE SUCH A COMFORTABLE MAN YOU SEE SAID MINNIE

1846-144458-0032 HE TOOK MY VARIOUS DIMENSIONS AND PUT THEM DOWN IN A BOOK
1846-144458-0033 AND TO CERTAIN FASHIONS WHICH HE SAID HAD JUST COME UP AND TO CERTAIN OTHER FASHIONS WHICH HE SAID HAD JUST GONE OUT AND BY THAT SORT OF THING WE VERY OFTEN LOSE A LITTLE MINT OF MONEY SAID MISTER OMER BUT FASHIONS ARE LIKE HUMAN BEINGS
1846-144458-0034 THEY COME IN NOBODY KNOWS WHEN WHY OR HOW AND THEY GO OUT NOBODY KNOWS WHEN WHY OR HOW EVERYTHING IS LIKE LIFE IN MY OPINION IF YOU LOOK AT IT IN THAT POINT OF VIEW I WAS TOO SORROWFUL TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION
1846-144458-0035 WHICH WOULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN BEYOND ME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND MISTER OMER TOOK ME BACK INTO THE PARLOUR BREATHING WITH SOME DIFFICULTY ON THE WAY HE THEN CALLED DOWN A LITTLE BREAK NECK RANGE OF STEPS BEHIND A DOOR BRING UP THAT TEA AND BREAD AND BUTTER
1846-144458-0036 WHICH AFTER SOME TIME DURING WHICH I SAT LOOKING ABOUT ME AND THINKING AND LISTENING TO THE STITCHING IN THE ROOM AND THE TUNE THAT WAS BEING HAMMERED ACROSS THE YARD APPEARED ON A TRAY AND TURNED OUT TO BE FOR ME I HAVE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH YOU SAID MISTER OMER
1846-144458-0037 AFTER WATCHING ME FOR SOME MINUTES DURING WHICH I HAD NOT MADE MUCH IMPRESSION ON THE BREAKFAST FOR THE BLACK THINGS DESTROYED MY APPETITE I HAVE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH YOU A LONG TIME MY YOUNG FRIEND HAVE YOU SIR ALL YOUR LIFE SAID MISTER OMER
1846-144458-0038 HE LAYS IN FIVE AND TWEN TY FOOT OF GROUND IF HE LAYS IN A FRACTION
1846-144458-0039 OR HER DIRECTION I FORGET WHICH DO YOU KNOW HOW MY LITTLE BROTHER IS SIR I INQUIRED MISTER OMER SHOOK HIS HEAD RAT TAT TAT RAT TAT TAT RAT TAT TAT HE IS IN HIS MOTHER'S ARMS SAID HE
1846-144458-0040 OH POOR LITTLE FELLOW IS HE DEAD DON'T MIND IT MORE THAN YOU CAN HELP SAID MISTER OMER YES THE BABY'S DEAD MY WOUNDS BROKE OUT AFRESH AT THIS INTELLIGENCE I LEFT THE SCARCELY TASTED BREAKFAST
1846-144458-0041 AND WENT AND RESTED MY HEAD ON ANOTHER TABLE IN A CORNER OF THE LITTLE ROOM WHICH MINNIE HASTILY CLEARED LEST I SHOULD SPOT THE MOURNING THAT WAS LYING THERE WITH MY TEARS SHE WAS A PRETTY GOOD NATURED GIRL AND PUT MY HAIR AWAY FROM MY EYES WITH A
1846-144458-0042 SOFT KIND TOUCH BUT SHE WAS VERY CHEERFUL AT HAVING NEARLY FINISHED HER WORK AND BEING IN GOOD TIME AND WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM ME
1846-144458-0043 AS YOU SAID WE COULD MAKE A LITTLE TRIP OF IT AND GO OVER TOGETHER IF IT WAS DONE MINNIE AND ME AND YOU OH I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE ME OUT ALTOGETHER SAID MISTER OMER LAUGHING TILL HE COUGHED
1846-144458-0044 AS YOU WAS SO GOOD AS TO SAY THAT RESUMED THE YOUNG MAN WHY I TURNED TO WITH A WILL YOU SEE WILL YOU GIVE ME YOUR OPINION OF IT I WILL SAID MISTER OMER RISING MY DEAR AND HE STOPPED AND TURNED TO ME WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE YOUR NO FATHER
1846-144458-0045 MINNIE INTERPOSED I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE AGREEABLE MY DEAR SAID MISTER OMER BUT PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT
1846-144458-0046 I HAD NEVER HEARD ONE MAKING I HAD NEVER SEEN ONE THAT I KNOW OF BUT IT CAME INTO MY MIND WHAT THE NOISE WAS WHILE IT WAS GOING ON AND WHEN THE YOUNG MAN ENTERED I AM SURE I KNEW WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING THE WORK BEING NOW FINISHED
1846-144458-0047 WHOSE NAMES I HAD NOT HEARD BRUSHED THE SHREDS AND THREADS FROM THEIR DRESSES AND WENT INTO THE SHOP TO PUT THAT TO RIGHTS AND WAIT FOR CUSTOMERS MINNIE STAYED BEHIND TO FOLD UP WHAT THEY HAD MADE AND PACK IT IN TWO BASKETS
1846-144458-0048 AND HE MUST MAKE HASTE AND GET HIMSELF READY THEN HE WENT OUT AGAIN AND THEN SHE PUT HER THIMBLE AND SCISSORS IN HER POCKET AND STUCK A NEEDLE THREADED WITH BLACK THREAD NEATLY IN THE BOSOM OF HER GOWN AND PUT ON HER OUTER CLOTHING SMARTLY
1846-144458-0049 AT A LITTLE GLASS BEHIND THE DOOR IN WHICH I SAW THE REFLECTION OF HER PLEASED FACE ALL THIS I OBSERVED SITTING AT THE TABLE IN THE CORNER WITH MY HEAD LEANING ON MY HAND AND MY THOUGHTS RUNNING ON VERY DIFFERENT THINGS THE CHAISE SOON CAME ROUND TO THE FRONT OF THE SHOP
1846-144458-0050 AND THE BASKETS BEING PUT IN FIRST I WAS PUT IN NEXT AND THOSE THREE FOLLOWED I REMEMBER IT AS A KIND OF HALF CHAISE CART HALF PIANOFORTE VAN PAINTED OF A SOMBRE COLOUR AND DRAWN BY A BLACK HORSE WITH A LONG TAIL
1846-144458-0051 THERE WAS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR US ALL I DO NOT THINK I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED SO STRANGE A FEELING IN MY LIFE I AM WISER NOW PERHAPS AS THAT OF BEING WITH THEM REMEMBERING HOW THEY HAD BEEN EMPLOYED AND SEEING THEM ENJOY THE RIDE
1846-144458-0052 I WAS NOT ANGRY WITH THEM I WAS MORE AFRAID OF THEM AS IF I WERE CAST AWAY AMONG CREATURES WITH WHOM I HAD NO COMMUNITY OF NATURE THEY WERE VERY CHEERFUL THE OLD MAN SAT IN FRONT TO DRIVE AND THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE SAT BEHIND HIM
1846-144458-0053 AND WHENEVER HE SPOKE TO THEM LEANED FORWARD THE ONE ON ONE SIDE OF HIS CHUBBY FACE AND THE OTHER ON THE OTHER AND MADE A GREAT DEAL OF HIM THEY WOULD HAVE TALKED TO ME TOO BUT I HELD BACK AND MOPED IN MY CORNER SCARED BY THEIR LOVE MAKING AND HILARITY
1846-144458-0054 AND ALMOST WONDERING THAT NO JUDGEMENT CAME UPON THEM FOR THEIR HARDNESS OF HEART SO WHEN THEY STOPPED TO BAIT THE HORSE AND ATE AND DRANK AND ENJOYED THEMSELVES I COULD TOUCH NOTHING THAT THEY TOUCHED BUT KEPT MY FAST UNBROKEN SO WHEN WE REACHED HOME
1846-144458-0055 I DROPPED OUT OF THE CHAISE BEHIND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THAT I MIGHT NOT BE IN THEIR COMPANY BEFORE THOSE SOLEMN WINDOWS LOOKING BLINDLY ON ME LIKE CLOSED EYES ONCE BRIGHT AND OH
1846-144458-0056 THAT WHICH IN THE BETTER TIME WAS MINE I WAS IN PEGGOTTY'S ARMS BEFORE I GOT TO THE DOOR AND SHE TOOK ME INTO THE HOUSE HER GRIEF BURST OUT WHEN SHE FIRST SAW ME BUT SHE CONTROLLED IT SOON AND SPOKE IN WHISPERS AND WALKED SOFTLY AS IF THE DEAD COULD BE DISTURBED
1846-144458-0057 MISTER MURDSTONE TOOK NO HEED OF ME WHEN I WENT INTO THE PARLOUR WHERE HE WAS
1846-144458-0058 AND PONDERING IN HIS ELBOW CHAIR MISS MURDSTONE WHO WAS BUSY AT HER WRITING DESK WHICH WAS COVERED WITH LETTERS AND PAPERS GAVE ME HER COLD FINGER NAILS AND ASKED ME IN AN IRON WHISPER IF I HAD BEEN MEASURED FOR MY MOURNING I SAID YES
1846-144458-0059 AND YOUR SHIRTS SAID MISS MURDSTONE HAVE YOU BROUGHT EM HOME YES MA'AM I HAVE BROUGHT HOME ALL MY CLOTHES THIS WAS ALL THE CONSOLATION THAT HER FIRMNESS ADMINISTERED TO ME
1846-144458-0060 I DO NOT DOUBT THAT SHE HAD A CHOICE PLEASURE IN EXHIBITING WHAT SHE CALLED HER SELF COMMAND AND HER FIRMNESS AND HER STRENGTH OF MIND
1846-144458-0061 AND SHE SHOWED IT NOW IN REDUCING EVERYTHING TO PEN AND INK AND BEING MOVED BY NOTHING ALL THE REST OF THAT DAY AND FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AFTERWARDS SHE SAT AT THAT DESK SCRATCHING COMPOSEDLY WITH A HARD PEN
1846-144458-0062 OR APPEARING WITH AN ATOM OF HER DRESS ASTRAY HER BROTHER TOOK A BOOK SOMETIMES BUT NEVER READ IT THAT I SAW HE WOULD OPEN IT AND LOOK AT IT AS IF HE WERE READING BUT WOULD REMAIN FOR A WHOLE HOUR WITHOUT TURNING THE LEAF AND THEN PUT IT DOWN AND WALK TO AND FRO IN THE ROOM
1846-144458-0063 I USED TO SIT WITH FOLDED HANDS WATCHING HIM AND COUNTING HIS FOOTSTEPS HOUR AFTER HOUR HE VERY SELDOM SPOKE TO HER AND NEVER TO ME HE SEEMED TO BE THE ONLY RESTLESS THING EXCEPT THE CLOCKS IN THE WHOLE MOTIONLESS HOUSE
1846-144458-0064 IN THESE DAYS BEFORE THE FUNERAL I SAW BUT LITTLE OF PEGGOTTY EXCEPT THAT IN PASSING UP OR DOWN STAIRS I ALWAYS FOUND HER CLOSE TO THE ROOM WHERE MY MOTHER AND HER BABY LAY
1846-144458-0065 AND SAT BY MY BED'S HEAD WHILE I WENT TO SLEEP A DAY OR TWO BEFORE THE BURIAL I THINK IT WAS A DAY OR TWO BEFORE BUT I AM CONSCIOUS OF CONFUSION IN MY MIND ABOUT THAT HEAVY TIME WITH NOTHING TO MARK ITS PROGRESS SHE TOOK ME INTO THE ROOM
1846-144458-0066 I ONLY RECOLLECT THAT UNDERNEATH SOME WHITE COVERING ON THE BED WITH A BEAUTIFUL CLEANLINESS AND FRESHNESS ALL AROUND IT THERE SEEMED TO ME TO LIE EMBODIED THE SOLEMN STILLNESS THAT WAS IN THE HOUSE AND THAT WHEN SHE WOULD HAVE TURNED THE COVER GENTLY BACK I CRIED
1846-144458-0067 OH NO OH NO AND HELD HER HAND IF THE FUNERAL HAD BEEN YESTERDAY I COULD NOT RECOLLECT IT BETTER THE VERY AIR OF THE BEST PARLOUR WHEN I WENT IN AT THE DOOR THE BRIGHT CONDITION OF THE FIRE
1846-144458-0068 AND HOW IS MASTER DAVID HE SAYS KINDLY I CANNOT TELL HIM VERY WELL I GIVE HIM MY HAND WHICH HE HOLDS IN HIS DEAR ME SAYS MISTER CHILLIP MEEKLY SMILING WITH SOMETHING SHINING IN HIS EYE OUR LITTLE FRIENDS GROW UP AROUND US
1846-144458-0069 THEY GROW OUT OF OUR KNOWLEDGE MA'AM THIS IS TO MISS MURDSTONE WHO MAKES NO REPLY THERE IS A GREAT IMPROVEMENT HERE MA'AM SAYS MISTER CHILLIP MISS MURDSTONE MERELY ANSWERS WITH A FROWN AND A FORMAL BEND MISTER CHILLIP DISCOMFITED
1846-144458-0070 GOES INTO A CORNER KEEPING ME WITH HIM AND OPENS HIS MOUTH NO MORE I REMARK THIS BECAUSE I REMARK EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS NOT BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT MYSELF OR HAVE DONE SINCE I CAME HOME AND NOW THE BELL BEGINS TO SOUND
1846-144458-0071 AND MISTER OMER AND ANOTHER COME TO MAKE US READY AS PEGGOTTY WAS WONT TO TELL ME LONG AGO THE FOLLOWERS OF MY FATHER TO THE SAME GRAVE WERE MADE READY IN THE SAME ROOM THERE ARE MISTER MURDSTONE OUR NEIGHBOUR MISTER GRAYPER
1846-144458-0072 WE STAND AROUND THE GRAVE THE DAY SEEMS DIFFERENT TO ME FROM EVERY OTHER DAY AND THE LIGHT NOT OF THE SAME COLOUR OF A SADDER COLOUR NOW THERE IS A SOLEMN HUSH
1846-144458-0073 WITH WHAT IS RESTING IN THE MOULD AND WHILE WE STAND BAREHEADED I HEAR THE VOICE OF THE CLERGYMAN SOUNDING REMOTE IN THE OPEN AIR AND YET DISTINCT AND PLAIN SAYING I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE SAITH THE LORD
1846-144458-0074 THEN I HEAR SOBS AND STANDING APART AMONG THE LOOKERS ON I SEE THAT GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANT WHOM OF ALL THE PEOPLE UPON EARTH I LOVE THE BEST AND UNTO WHOM MY CHILDISH HEART IS CERTAIN THAT THE LORD WILL ONE DAY SAY WELL DONE
1846-144458-0075 THERE ARE MANY FACES THAT I KNOW AMONG THE LITTLE CROWD FACES THAT I KNEW IN CHURCH WHEN MINE WAS ALWAYS WONDERING THERE FACES THAT FIRST SAW MY MOTHER WHEN SHE CAME TO THE VILLAGE IN HER YOUTHFUL BLOOM I DO NOT MIND THEM I MIND NOTHING BUT MY GRIEF
1846-144458-0076 AND YET I SEE AND KNOW THEM ALL AND EVEN IN THE BACKGROUND FAR AWAY SEE MINNIE LOOKING ON AND HER EYE GLANCING ON HER SWEETHEART WHO IS NEAR ME IT IS OVER AND THE EARTH IS FILLED IN AND WE TURN TO COME AWAY BEFORE US STANDS OUR HOUSE
1846-144458-0077 SO PRETTY AND UNCHANGED SO LINKED IN MY MIND WITH THE YOUNG IDEA OF WHAT IS GONE THAT ALL MY SORROW HAS BEEN NOTHING TO THE SORROW IT CALLS FORTH BUT THEY TAKE ME ON AND MISTER CHILLIP TALKS TO ME AND WHEN WE GET HOME PUTS SOME WATER TO MY LIPS
1846-144458-0078 AND WHEN I ASK HIS LEAVE TO GO UP TO MY ROOM DISMISSES ME WITH THE GENTLENESS OF A WOMAN ALL THIS I SAY IS YESTERDAY'S EVENT
1846-144458-0079 BUT THIS STANDS LIKE A HIGH ROCK IN THE OCEAN I KNEW THAT PEGGOTTY WOULD COME TO ME IN MY ROOM THE SABBATH STILLNESS OF THE TIME THE DAY WAS SO LIKE SUNDAY I HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT WAS SUITED TO US BOTH
1846-144458-0080 SHE SAT DOWN BY MY SIDE UPON MY LITTLE BED AND HOLDING MY HAND AND SOMETIMES PUTTING IT TO HER LIPS AND SOMETIMES SMOOTHING IT WITH HERS AS SHE MIGHT HAVE COMFORTED MY LITTLE BROTHER TOLD ME IN HER WAY ALL THAT SHE HAD TO TELL CONCERNING WHAT HAD HAPPENED
1846-144458-0081 SHE WAS NEVER WELL SAID PEGGOTTY FOR A LONG TIME SHE WAS UNCERTAIN IN HER MIND AND NOT HAPPY WHEN HER BABY WAS BORN I THOUGHT AT FIRST SHE WOULD GET BETTER BUT SHE WAS MORE DELICATE AND SUNK A LITTLE EVERY DAY
1846-144458-0082 SHE USED TO LIKE TO SIT ALONE BEFORE HER BABY CAME AND THEN SHE CRIED BUT AFTERWARDS SHE USED TO SING TO IT SO SOFT
1846-144458-0083 DIDN'T MY SWEET GIRL HERE PEGGOTTY STOPPED AND SOFTLY BEAT UPON MY HAND A LITTLE WHILE THE LAST TIME THAT I SAW HER LIKE HER OWN OLD SELF WAS THE NIGHT WHEN YOU CAME HOME MY DEAR THE DAY YOU WENT AWAY SHE SAID TO ME
1846-144458-0084 I NEVER SHALL SEE MY PRETTY DARLING AGAIN
1846-144458-0085 THAT TELLS THE TRUTH I KNOW SHE TRIED TO HOLD UP AFTER THAT AND MANY A TIME WHEN THEY TOLD HER SHE WAS THOUGHTLESS AND LIGHT HEARTED MADE BELIEVE TO BE SO BUT IT WAS ALL A BYGONE THEN SHE NEVER TOLD HER HUSBAND
1846-144458-0086 WHAT SHE HAD TOLD ME SHE WAS AFRAID OF SAYING IT TO ANYBODY ELSE TILL ONE NIGHT A LITTLE MORE THAN A WEEK BEFORE IT HAPPENED WHEN SHE SAID TO HIM MY DEAR I THINK I AM DYING IT'S OFF MY MIND NOW PEGGOTTY SHE TOLD ME
1846-144458-0087 WHEN I LAID HER IN HER BED THAT NIGHT HE WILL BELIEVE IT MORE AND MORE POOR FELLOW EVERY DAY FOR A FEW DAYS TO COME AND THEN IT WILL BE PAST I AM VERY TIRED IF THIS IS SLEEP SIT BY ME WHILE I SLEEP DON'T LEAVE ME GOD BLESS BOTH MY CHILDREN
1846-144458-0088 GOD PROTECT AND KEEP MY FATHERLESS BOY I NEVER LEFT HER AFTERWARDS SAID PEGGOTTY SHE OFTEN TALKED TO THEM TWO DOWNSTAIRS FOR SHE LOVED THEM SHE COULDN'T BEAR NOT TO LOVE ANYONE WHO WAS ABOUT HER BUT WHEN THEY WENT AWAY FROM HER BED SIDE SHE ALWAYS TURNED TO ME
1846-144458-0089 AND NEVER FELL ASLEEP IN ANY OTHER WAY ON THE LAST NIGHT IN THE EVENING SHE KISSED ME AND SAID IF MY BABY SHOULD DIE TOO PEGGOTTY PLEASE LET THEM LAY HIM IN MY ARMS AND BURY US TOGETHER
1846-144458-0090 WHEN SHE LAY HERE BLESSED HIM NOT ONCE BUT A THOUSAND TIMES ANOTHER SILENCE FOLLOWED THIS AND ANOTHER GENTLE BEATING ON MY HAND IT WAS PRETTY FAR IN THE NIGHT SAID PEGGOTTY WHEN SHE ASKED ME FOR SOME DRINK
1846-144458-0091 DAYBREAK HAD COME AND THE SUN WAS RISING WHEN SHE SAID TO ME HOW KIND AND CONSIDERATE MISTER COPPERFIELD HAD ALWAYS BEEN TO HER AND HOW HE HAD BORNE WITH HER AND TOLD HER WHEN SHE DOUBTED HERSELF THAT A LOVING HEART WAS BETTER AND STRONGER THAN WISDOM
1846-144458-0092 PEGGOTTY MY DEAR SHE SAID THEN PUT ME NEARER TO YOU FOR SHE WAS VERY WEAK LAY YOUR GOOD ARM UNDERNEATH MY NECK SHE SAID AND TURN ME TO YOU FOR YOUR FACE IS GOING FAR OFF AND I WANT IT TO BE NEAR
1846-144458-0093 I PUT IT AS SHE ASKED AND OH DAVY THE TIME HAD COME WHEN MY FIRST PARTING WORDS TO YOU WERE TRUE WHEN SHE WAS GLAD TO LAY HER POOR HEAD ON HER STUPID CROSS OLD PEGGOTTY'S ARM AND SHE DIED LIKE A CHILD THAT HAD GONE TO SLEEP
1846-144458-0094 THUS ENDED PEGGOTTY'S NARRATION FROM THE MOMENT OF MY KNOWING OF THE DEATH OF MY MOTHER
1846-144458-0095 FROM THAT INSTANT ONLY AS THE YOUNG MOTHER OF MY EARLIEST IMPRESSIONS WHO HAD BEEN USED TO WIND HER BRIGHT CURLS ROUND AND ROUND HER FINGER AND TO DANCE WITH ME AT TWILIGHT IN THE PARLOUR
