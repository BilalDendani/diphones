7320-104988-0000 THERE WAS NO COUNTER IN FRONT ONLY SOME TABLES ON WHICH LAY STREWN FANCY BOXES OF THREAD AND OTHER USELESS KNICK KNACKS TO WHICH CERTAIN SHOPKEEPERS APPEAR TO CLING THOUGH THEY CAN SELDOM FIND CUSTOMERS FOR THEM
7320-104988-0001 A WOMAN STOOD AT ONE OF THESE TABLES UNTANGLING A SKEIN OF RED YARN BEHIND HER I SAW ANOTHER LEANING IN AN ABSTRACTED WAY OVER A COUNTER WHICH RAN FROM WALL TO WALL
7320-104988-0002 ACROSS THE EXTREME END OF THE SHOP THIS I TOOK TO BE BESS
7320-104988-0003 THE WOMAN WITH THE SKEIN APPEARED ON THE CONTRARY AS EAGER TO SEE AS THE OTHER SEEMED INDIFFERENT I HAD TO BUY SOMETHING AND I DID SO IN AS MATTER OF FACT A WAY AS POSSIBLE CONSIDERING
7320-104988-0004 THAT MY ATTENTION WAS MORE GIVEN TO THE WOMAN IN THE REAR THAN TO THE ARTICLES I WAS PURCHASING YOU HAVE A VERY CONVENIENT PLACE HERE I CASUALLY REMARKED AS I HANDED OUT MY MONEY
7320-104988-0005 WITH THIS I TURNED SQUARELY ABOUT AND LOOKED DIRECTLY AT HER WHOM I BELIEVED TO BE BESS A VOLUBLE ANSWER FROM THE WOMAN AT MY SIDE BUT NOT THE WINK OF AN EYE FROM THE ONE WHOSE ATTENTION I HAD ENDEAVORED TO ATTRACT
7320-104988-0006 I LIVE IN THE HOUSE OPPOSITE I CARELESSLY WENT ON TAKING IN EVERY DETAIL OF THE STRANGE BEING I WAS SECRETLY ADDRESSING
7320-104988-0007 YOU LIVE OPPOSITE IN MAYOR PACKARD'S HOUSE I APPROACHED HER SMILING SHE HAD DROPPED HER HANDS FROM HER CHIN AND SEEMED VERY EAGER NOW MORE EAGER THAN THE OTHER WOMAN TO INTEREST ME IN WHAT SHE HAD ABOUT HER AND SO HOLD ME
7320-104988-0008 TO THE SHOP LOOK AT THIS SHE CRIED HOLDING UP AN ARTICLE OF SUCH CHEAP WORKMANSHIP THAT I WONDERED SO SENSIBLE AN APPEARING WOMAN WOULD CUMBER HER SHELVES WITH IT I AM GLAD YOU LIVE OVER THERE
7320-104988-0009 FOR I HAD NODDED TO HER QUESTION I'M GREATLY INTERESTED IN THAT HOUSE
7320-104988-0010 I MET HER LOOK IT WAS SHARP AND VERY INTELLIGENT THEN YOU KNOW ITS REPUTATION I LAUGHINGLY SUGGESTED SHE MADE A CONTEMPTUOUS GESTURE THE WOMAN WAS REALLY VERY GOOD LOOKING BUT BAFFLING IN HER MANNER
7320-104988-0011 AS MISTER ROBINSON HAD SAID AND VERY HARD TO CLASSIFY THAT ISN'T WHAT INTERESTS ME SHE PROTESTED I'VE OTHER REASONS
7320-104988-0012 NO NOR EVEN A FRIEND I AM IN THEIR EMPLOY JUST NOW AS A COMPANION TO MISSUS PACKARD HER HEALTH IS NOT VERY GOOD AND THE MAYOR IS AWAY A GREAT DEAL
7320-104988-0013 BUSINESS IS VERY POOR IN THIS SHOP I WAS STANDING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HER TURNING QUICKLY ABOUT I LOOKED THROUGH THE NARROW PANES OF THE DOOR AND FOUND THAT MY EYES NATURALLY RESTED ON THE STOOP OF THE OPPOSITE HOUSE
7320-104988-0014 INDEED THIS STOOP WAS ABOUT ALL THAT COULD BE SEEN FROM THE SPOT
7320-104988-0015 WE ARE QUITE SURROUNDED THE HOUSE SHOULD CERTAINLY HOLD TREASURE TO WARRANT ALL THIS INTEREST BUT WHAT COULD THIS ONE TIME DOMESTIC KNOW OF THE MISSING BONDS AN OLD FASHIONED DOORWAY I REMARKED
7320-104988-0016 IT MAKES THE HOUSE CONSPICUOUS BUT IN A WAY I LIKE I DON'T WONDER YOU ENJOY LOOKING AT IT TO ME SUCH A HOUSE AND SUCH A DOORWAY SUGGEST MYSTERY AND A ROMANTIC PAST IF THE PLACE IS NOT HAUNTED
7320-104988-0017 AND ONLY A FOOL BELIEVES IN GHOSTS SOMETHING STRANGE MUST HAVE HAPPENED THERE OR I SHOULD NEVER HAVE THE NERVOUS FEELING I HAVE IN GOING ABOUT THE HALLS AND UP AND DOWN THE STAIRWAYS DID YOU NEVER HAVE THAT FEELING NEVER I'M NOT
7320-104988-0018 GIVEN TO FEELINGS I LIVE ONE DAY AFTER ANOTHER AND JUST WAIT NOT GIVEN TO FEELINGS WITH SUCH EYES IN SUCH A FACE YOU SHOULD HAVE LOOKED DOWN WHEN YOU SAID THAT BESS I MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED YOU THEN WAIT
7320-104988-0019 I SOFTLY REPEATED WAIT FOR WHAT FOR FORTUNE TO ENTER YOUR LITTLE SHOP DOOR NO FOR MY HUSBAND TO COME BACK WAS HER UNEXPECTED ANSWER UTTERED GRIMLY ENOUGH TO HAVE FRIGHTENED THAT HUSBAND AWAY AGAIN
7320-104988-0020 HAD HE BEEN FORTUNATE OR UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HEAR HER I'M A MARRIED WOMAN MISS AND SHOULDN'T BE WORKING LIKE THIS AND I WON'T BE ALWAYS MY MAN'LL COME BACK AND MAKE A LADY OF ME AGAIN IT'S THAT I'M WAITING FOR
7320-104988-0021 HERE A CUSTOMER CAME IN NATURALLY I DREW BACK FOR OUR FACES WERE NEARLY TOUCHING DON'T GO SHE PLEADED CATCHING ME BY THE SLEEVE AND TURNING ASTONISHINGLY PALE FOR ONE ORDINARILY SO RUDDY
7320-104988-0022 I WANT TO ASK A FAVOR OF YOU COME INTO MY LITTLE ROOM BEHIND YOU WON'T REGRET IT THIS LAST IN AN EMPHATIC WHISPER
7320-104988-0023 AND CONGRATULATING MYSELF GREATLY UPON MY SUCCESS IN INSURING HER IMMEDIATE CONFIDENCE I SLIPPED THROUGH THE OPENING SHE MADE FOR ME BETWEEN THE TABLES SERVING FOR A COUNTER AND FOLLOWED HER INTO A ROOM AT THE REAR WHICH
7320-104988-0024 FROM ITS APPEARANCE ANSWERED THE TRIPLE PURPOSE OF SLEEPING ROOM PARLOR AND KITCHEN PARDON MY IMPERTINENCE SAID SHE AS SHE CAREFULLY CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND US IT'S NOT MY HABIT TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH STRANGERS BUT
7320-104988-0025 I'VE TAKEN A FANCY TO YOU AND THINK YOU CAN BE TRUSTED WILL SHE HESITATED THEN BURST OUT WILL YOU DO SOMETHING FOR ME IF I CAN I SMILED HOW LONG DO YOU EXPECT TO STAY OVER THERE OH THAT I CAN'T SAY
7320-104988-0026 A MONTH A WEEK PROBABLY A WEEK THEN YOU CAN DO WHAT I WANT MISS SAUNDERS I PUT IN THERE IS SOMETHING IN THAT HOUSE WHICH BELONGS TO ME I STARTED THIS WAS HARDLY WHAT I EXPECTED HER TO SAY
7320-104988-0027 SOMETHING OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO ME SOMETHING WHICH I MUST HAVE AND HAVE VERY SOON
7320-104988-0028 ONE DAY WHEN MY FUTURE LOOKED DOUBTFUL AND I DIDN'T KNOW
7320-104988-0029 MISSUS PACKARD WOULD THINK IT STRANGE IF SHE SAW WHERE AND MIGHT MAKE IT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE FOR ME BUT YOU CAN GET WHAT I WANT WITHOUT TROUBLE IF YOU ARE NOT AFRAID OF GOING ABOUT THE HOUSE AT NIGHT
7320-104988-0030 IT'S A LITTLE BOX WITH MY NAME ON IT AND IT IS HIDDEN WHERE BEHIND A BRICK I LOOSENED IN THE CELLAR WALL I CAN DESCRIBE THE VERY PLACE OH YOU THINK I AM ASKING TOO MUCH OF YOU A STRANGER AND A LADY

7320-104988-0032 YOU NEEDN'T NO INCONVENIENCE WILL FOLLOW TO ANY ONE IF YOU ARE CAREFUL TO RELY ON YOURSELF AND NOT LET ANY OTHER PERSON SEE OR HANDLE THIS BOX
7320-104988-0033 HOW LARGE IS IT I ASKED QUITE AS BREATHLESS AS HERSELF AS I REALIZED THE POSSIBILITIES UNDERLYING THIS REMARKABLE REQUEST IT IS SO SMALL THAT YOU CAN CONCEAL IT UNDER
7320-104988-0034 AN APRON OR IN THE POCKET OF YOUR COAT IN EXCHANGE FOR IT I WILL GIVE YOU ALL I CAN AFFORD TEN DOLLARS NO MORE THAN THAT I ASKED TESTING HER NO MORE AT FIRST
7320-104988-0035 IF IT BRINGS ME WHAT IT OUGHT TO
7320-104988-0036 DOES THAT SATISFY YOU ARE YOU WILLING TO RISK AN ENCOUNTER WITH THE GHOST FOR JUST TEN DOLLARS AND A PROMISE THE SMILE WITH
7320-104988-0037 I THINK IT GAVE ME A MORE THRILLING CONSCIOUSNESS OF HUMAN TERROR IN FACE OF THE SUPERNATURAL THAN ANYTHING WHICH I HAD YET HEARD IN THIS CONNECTION SURELY HER MOTIVE FOR REMAINING IN THE HAUNTED HOUSE
7320-104988-0038 HAD BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY STRONG
7320-104988-0039 WHEN THE TIME COMES FROM GOING INTO THAT CELLAR AT NIGHT I SHOOK MY HEAD I HAD ALREADY REGAINED BOTH MY WILL POWER AND THE RESOLUTION TO CARRY OUT THIS ADVENTURE TO THE END
7320-104988-0040 YES AND BRING IT TO ME HERE AS EARLY THE NEXT DAY AS YOU CAN LEAVE MISSUS PACKARD YES OH YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS TO ME
7320-104988-0041 AND GET THIS BOX FOR ME ALL BY YOURSELF YES IF YOU DEMAND IT I DO YOU WILL SEE WHY SOME DAY VERY WELL YOU CAN TRUST ME NOW TELL ME WHERE I AM TO FIND THE BRICK YOU DESIGNATE
7320-104988-0042 IT'S IN THE CELLAR WALL ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE YOU WILL SEE NOTHING BUT STONE FOR A FOOT OR TWO ABOVE THE FLOOR BUT AFTER THAT COMES THE BRICK WALL
7320-104988-0043 ON ONE OF THESE BRICKS YOU WILL DETECT A CROSS SCRATCHED THAT'S THE ONE
7320-104988-0044 FEEL BEHIND WITH YOUR HAND AND YOU WILL FIND THE BOX A QUESTIONABLE TASK WHAT IF I SHOULD BE SEEN AT IT THE GHOST WILL PROTECT YOU AGAIN THAT SMILE OF MINGLED SARCASM AND INNUENDO
7320-104988-0045 IT WAS NO COMMON SERVANT GIRL'S SMILE ANY MORE THAN HER LANGUAGE WAS THAT OF THE IGNORANT DOMESTIC I BELIEVE THE GHOST FAILS TO WALK SINCE THE PRESENT TENANTS CAME INTO THE HOUSE I REMARKED BUT ITS REPUTATION REMAINS
7320-104988-0046 I CAN FIND SOME WAY OF LETTING YOU IN
7320-104988-0047 BITTER DETERMINATION YET YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN FRIGHTENED BY ANYTHING THERE I KNOW BUT I HAVE SUFFERED THAT IS FOR ONE WHO HAS NO FEELINGS THE BOX
7320-104988-0048 WILL HAVE TO REMAIN IN ITS PLACE UNDISTURBED IF YOU WON'T GET IT FOR ME POSITIVELY YES MISS NOTHING WOULD INDUCE ME EVEN TO CROSS THE STREET
