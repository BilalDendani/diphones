7585-96245-0000 AT THE POINT AT WHICH IN ITS MOST PERFECT MANIFESTATION IT HAS ATTAINED TO THE COMPLETELY ADEQUATE KNOWLEDGE OF ITS OWN NATURE EXPRESS ITSELF ANEW IN TWO WAYS
7585-96245-0001 EITHER IT WILLS HERE AT THE SUMMIT OF MENTAL ENDOWMENT AND SELF CONSCIOUSNESS SIMPLY WHAT IT WILLED BEFORE BLINDLY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY AND IF SO KNOWLEDGE ALWAYS REMAINS ITS MOTIVE
7585-96245-0002 IN THE WHOLE AS IN THE PARTICULAR CASE OR CONVERSELY THIS KNOWLEDGE BECOMES FOR IT A QUIETER WHICH APPEASES AND SUPPRESSES ALL WILLING
7585-96245-0003 THIS IS THAT ASSERTION AND DENIAL OF THE WILL TO LIVE WHICH WAS STATED ABOVE IN GENERAL TERMS AS IN THE REFERENCE OF INDIVIDUAL CONDUCT A GENERAL NOT A PARTICULAR MANIFESTATION OF WILL
7585-96245-0004 IT DOES NOT DISTURB AND MODIFY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHARACTER NOR DOES IT FIND ITS EXPRESSION IN PARTICULAR ACTIONS BUT EITHER BY AN EVER
7585-96245-0005 MORE MARKED APPEARANCE OF THE WHOLE METHOD OF ACTION IT HAS FOLLOWED HITHERTO OR CONVERSELY BY THE ENTIRE SUPPRESSION OF IT IT EXPRESSES IN A LIVING FORM THE MAXIMS
7585-96245-0006 WHICH THE WILL HAS FREELY ADOPTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE IT HAS NOW ATTAINED TO BY THE EXPLANATIONS WE HAVE JUST GIVEN OF FREEDOM NECESSITY AND CHARACTER
7585-96245-0007 WE HAVE SOMEWHAT FACILITATED AND PREPARED THE WAY FOR THE CLEARER DEVELOPMENT OF ALL THIS WHICH IS THE PRINCIPAL SUBJECT OF THIS LAST BOOK BUT WE SHALL HAVE DONE SO STILL MORE WHEN WE HAVE
7585-96245-0008 TURNED OUR ATTENTION TO LIFE ITSELF THE WILLING OR NOT WILLING OF WHICH IS THE GREAT QUESTION AND HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO FIND OUT GENERALLY WHAT THE WILL ITSELF WHICH IS EVERYWHERE THE INMOST
7585-96245-0009 WHAT IS GENERALLY AND MAINLY TO BE REGARDED AS ITS POSITION IN THIS ITS OWN WORLD
7585-96245-0010 WE SEE THIS IN THE SIMPLEST OF ALL NATURAL PHENOMENA GRAVITY WHICH DOES NOT CEASE TO STRIVE AND PRESS TOWARDS A MATHEMATICAL CENTRE TO REACH WHICH WOULD BE THE ANNIHILATION BOTH OF ITSELF AND MATTER
7585-96245-0011 WE SEE IT IN THE OTHER SIMPLE NATURAL PHENOMENA A SOLID TENDS TOWARDS FLUIDITY EITHER BY MELTING OR DISSOLVING FOR ONLY SO WILL ITS CHEMICAL FORCES BE FREE RIGIDITY
7585-96245-0012 IS THE IMPRISONMENT IN WHICH IT IS HELD BY COLD THE FLUID TENDS TOWARDS THE GASEOUS STATE INTO WHICH IT PASSES AT ONCE AS SOON AS ALL PRESSURE IS REMOVED FROM IT NO BODY IS WITHOUT RELATIONSHIP
7585-96245-0013 ELECTRICITY TRANSMITS ITS INNER SELF REPULSION TO INFINITY THOUGH THE MASS OF THE EARTH ABSORBS THE EFFECT GALVANISM IS CERTAINLY SO LONG AS THE PILE IS WORKING AN AIMLESS
7585-96245-0014 UNCEASINGLY REPEATED ACT OF REPULSION AND ATTRACTION THE EXISTENCE OF THE PLANT IS JUST SUCH A RESTLESS NEVER SATISFIED STRIVING A CEASELESS TENDENCY
7585-96245-0015 THROUGH EVER ASCENDING FORMS TILL THE END THE SEED BECOMES A NEW STARTING POINT AND THIS REPEATED AD INFINITUM NOWHERE AN END NOWHERE A FINAL SATISFACTION
7585-96245-0016 NOWHERE A RESTING PLACE IT WILL ALSO BE REMEMBERED FROM THE SECOND BOOK THAT THE MULTITUDE OF NATURAL FORCES AND
7585-96245-0017 ORGANISED FORMS EVERYWHERE STRIVE WITH EACH OTHER FOR THE MATTER IN WHICH THEY DESIRE TO APPEAR FOR EACH OF THEM ONLY POSSESSES WHAT IT HAS WRESTED FROM THE OTHERS AND THUS A CONSTANT
7585-96245-0018 INTERNECINE WAR IS WAGED FROM WHICH FOR THE MOST PART ARISES THE RESISTANCE THROUGH WHICH THAT STRIVING WHICH CONSTITUTES THE INNER NATURE OF EVERYTHING IS AT ALL POINTS HINDERED
7585-96245-0019 STRUGGLES IN VAIN YET FROM ITS NATURE CANNOT LEAVE OFF TOILS ON LABORIOUSLY TILL THIS PHENOMENON DIES WHEN OTHERS EAGERLY SEIZE ITS PLACE AND ITS MATTER
7585-96245-0020 WE HAVE LONG SINCE RECOGNISED THIS STRIVING WHICH CONSTITUTES THE KERNEL AND IN ITSELF OF EVERYTHING AS IDENTICAL WITH THAT WHICH IN US WHERE IT MANIFESTS ITSELF
7585-96245-0021 MOST DISTINCTLY IN THE LIGHT OF THE FULLEST CONSCIOUSNESS IS CALLED WILL ITS HINDRANCE THROUGH AN OBSTACLE WHICH PLACES ITSELF BETWEEN IT AND ITS TEMPORARY AIM WE CALL SUFFERING
7585-96245-0022 AND ON THE OTHER HAND ITS ATTAINMENT OF THE END SATISFACTION WELLBEING HAPPINESS WE MAY ALSO TRANSFER THIS TERMINOLOGY TO THE PHENOMENA OF THE UNCONSCIOUS WORLD
7585-96245-0023 THEN WE SEE THEM INVOLVED IN CONSTANT SUFFERING AND WITHOUT ANY CONTINUING HAPPINESS FOR ALL EFFORT SPRINGS FROM DEFECT FROM DISCONTENT WITH ONE'S ESTATE
7585-96245-0024 IS THUS SUFFERING SO LONG AS IT IS NOT SATISFIED BUT NO SATISFACTION IS LASTING RATHER IT IS ALWAYS MERELY THE STARTING POINT OF A NEW EFFORT
7585-96245-0025 THE STRIVING WE SEE EVERYWHERE HINDERED IN MANY WAYS EVERYWHERE IN CONFLICT AND THEREFORE ALWAYS UNDER THE FORM OF SUFFERING THUS
7585-96245-0026 PRESENTS ITSELF DISTINCTLY TO US IN THE INTELLIGENT WORLD IN THE LIFE OF ANIMALS WHOSE CONSTANT SUFFERING IS EASILY PROVED BUT WITHOUT LINGERING OVER THESE INTERMEDIATE GRADES WE SHALL TURN TO THE LIFE
7585-96245-0027 OF MAN IN WHICH ALL THIS APPEARS WITH THE GREATEST DISTINCTNESS ILLUMINATED BY THE CLEAREST KNOWLEDGE
7585-96245-0028 THE SUFFERING ALSO BECOMES MORE AND MORE APPARENT IN THE PLANT THERE IS AS YET NO SENSIBILITY AND THEREFORE NO PAIN
7585-96245-0029 A CERTAIN VERY SMALL DEGREE OF SUFFERING IS EXPERIENCED BY THE LOWEST SPECIES OF ANIMAL LIFE INFUSORIA AND RADIATA EVEN IN INSECTS THE CAPACITY TO FEEL AND SUFFER IS STILL LIMITED
7585-96245-0030 IT FIRST APPEARS IN A HIGH DEGREE WITH THE COMPLETE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF VERTEBRATE ANIMALS AND ALWAYS IN A HIGHER DEGREE THE MORE INTELLIGENCE DEVELOPS THUS IN PROPORTION AS KNOWLEDGE ATTAINS TO DISTINCTNESS
7585-96245-0031 AS CONSCIOUSNESS ASCENDS PAIN ALSO INCREASES AND THEREFORE REACHES ITS HIGHEST DEGREE IN MAN AND THEN AGAIN THE MORE DISTINCTLY A MAN KNOWS THE MORE
7585-96245-0032 THE MAN WHO IS GIFTED WITH GENIUS SUFFERS MOST OF ALL IN THIS SENSE THAT IS
7585-96245-0033 THE ACCURATE RELATION BETWEEN THE DEGREE OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND THAT OF SUFFERING BY EXHIBITING IT IN A VISIBLE AND CLEAR FORM IN A DRAWING THE UPPER HALF OF HIS DRAWING REPRESENTS WOMEN
7585-96245-0034 WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN STOLEN AND WHO IN DIFFERENT GROUPS AND ATTITUDES EXPRESS IN MANY WAYS DEEP MATERNAL PAIN ANGUISH AND DESPAIR THE LOWER HALF OF THE DRAWING REPRESENTS SHEEP
7585-96245-0035 WHOSE LAMBS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY THEY ARE ARRANGED AND GROUPED IN PRECISELY THE SAME WAY SO THAT EVERY HUMAN HEAD EVERY HUMAN ATTITUDE OF THE UPPER HALF
7585-96245-0036 HAS BELOW A BRUTE HEAD AND ATTITUDE CORRESPONDING TO IT THUS WE SEE DISTINCTLY HOW THE PAIN WHICH IS POSSIBLE IN THE DULL BRUTE CONSCIOUSNESS IS RELATED TO THE VIOLENT GRIEF
7585-96245-0037 WHICH ONLY BECOMES POSSIBLE THROUGH DISTINCTNESS OF KNOWLEDGE AND CLEARNESS OF CONSCIOUSNESS WE DESIRE TO CONSIDER IN THIS WAY IN HUMAN EXISTENCE
7585-96245-0038 HOW ESSENTIAL TO ALL LIFE
7585-96245-0039 THAT IS ENLIGHTENED BY KNOWLEDGE THE WILL APPEARS AS AN INDIVIDUAL THE HUMAN INDIVIDUAL FINDS HIMSELF AS FINITE IN INFINITE SPACE AND TIME
7585-96245-0040 AND CONSEQUENTLY AS A VANISHING QUANTITY COMPARED WITH THEM HE IS PROJECTED INTO THEM AND ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR UNLIMITED NATURE HE HAS ALWAYS A MERELY RELATIVE NEVER ABSOLUTE WHEN AND WHERE
7585-96245-0041 OF HIS EXISTENCE FOR HIS PLACE AND DURATION ARE FINITE PARTS OF WHAT IS INFINITE AND BOUNDLESS HIS REAL EXISTENCE IS ONLY IN THE PRESENT WHOSE
7585-96245-0042 UNCHECKED FLIGHT INTO THE PAST IS A CONSTANT TRANSITION INTO DEATH A CONSTANT DYING FOR HIS PAST LIFE APART FROM ITS POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PRESENT AND THE TESTIMONY
7585-96245-0043 REGARDING THE WILL THAT IS EXPRESSED IN IT IS NOW ENTIRELY DONE WITH DEAD AND NO LONGER ANYTHING AND THEREFORE IT MUST BE AS A MATTER OF REASON
7585-96245-0044 INDIFFERENT TO HIM WHETHER THE CONTENT OF THAT PAST WAS PAIN OR PLEASURE BUT THE PRESENT IS ALWAYS PASSING THROUGH HIS HANDS INTO THE PAST THE FUTURE IS QUITE UNCERTAIN AND ALWAYS SHORT
7585-96245-0045 IS A CONSTANT HURRYING OF THE PRESENT INTO THE DEAD PAST A CONSTANT DYING BUT IF WE LOOK AT IT FROM THE PHYSICAL SIDE IT IS CLEAR THAT AS OUR WALKING IS ADMITTEDLY MERELY A
7585-96245-0046 EVERY BREATH WE DRAW WARDS OFF THE DEATH THAT IS CONSTANTLY INTRUDING UPON US IN THIS WAY WE FIGHT WITH IT EVERY MOMENT
7585-96245-0047 AT LONGER INTERVALS
7585-96245-0048 FOR WE BECAME SUBJECT TO HIM THROUGH BIRTH AND HE ONLY PLAYS FOR A LITTLE WHILE WITH HIS PREY BEFORE HE SWALLOWS IT UP WE PURSUE OUR LIFE HOWEVER WITH GREAT INTEREST AND MUCH SOLICITUDE
7585-96245-0049 AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AS WE BLOW OUT A SOAP BUBBLE AS LONG AND AS LARGE AS POSSIBLE ALTHOUGH WE KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT IT WILL BURST
7585-96245-0050 WILLING AND STRIVING IS ITS WHOLE BEING WHICH MAY BE VERY WELL COMPARED TO AN UNQUENCHABLE THIRST BUT THE BASIS OF ALL WILLING IS NEED DEFICIENCY AND THUS PAIN
7585-96245-0051 CONSEQUENTLY THE NATURE OF BRUTES AND MAN IS SUBJECT TO PAIN ORIGINALLY AND THROUGH ITS VERY BEING IF
7585-96245-0052 ON THE OTHER HAND IT LACKS OBJECTS OF DESIRE BECAUSE IT IS AT ONCE DEPRIVED OF THEM BY A TOO EASY SATISFACTION
7585-96245-0053 THUS ITS LIFE SWINGS LIKE A PENDULUM
7585-96245-0054 THIS HAS ALSO HAD TO EXPRESS ITSELF VERY ODDLY IN THIS WAY AFTER MAN HAD TRANSFERRED ALL PAIN AND TORMENTS TO HELL THERE THEN REMAINED NOTHING OVER FOR HEAVEN BUT
7585-96245-0055 BUT THE CONSTANT STRIVING WHICH CONSTITUTES THE INNER NATURE OF EVERY MANIFESTATION OF WILL OBTAINS ITS PRIMARY AND MOST GENERAL FOUNDATION
7585-96245-0056 AND WHAT GIVES STRENGTH TO THIS COMMAND IS JUST THAT THIS BODY IS NOTHING BUT THE OBJECTIFIED WILL TO LIVE ITSELF MAN AS THE MOST COMPLETE OBJECTIFICATION OF THAT WILL IS
7585-96245-0057 WITH THESE HE STANDS UPON THE EARTH LEFT TO HIMSELF UNCERTAIN ABOUT EVERYTHING EXCEPT HIS OWN NEED AND MISERY CONSEQUENTLY THE CARE
7585-96245-0058 FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THAT EXISTENCE UNDER EXACTING DEMANDS WHICH ARE RENEWED EVERY DAY
7585-96245-0059 THE WHOLE OF HUMAN LIFE
7585-96245-0060 THIS IS DIRECTLY RELATED THE SECOND CLAIM THAT OF THE PROPAGATION OF THE SPECIES
7585-96245-0061 WITH CAUTIOUS STEPS AND CASTING ANXIOUS GLANCES
7585-96245-0062 ROUND HIM HE PURSUES HIS PATH FOR A THOUSAND ACCIDENTS AND A THOUSAND ENEMIES LIE IN WAIT FOR HIM THUS HE WENT WHILE YET A SAVAGE THUS HE GOES IN CIVILISED LIFE THERE IS
7585-96245-0063 NO SECURITY FOR HIM
7585-96245-0064 THE LIFE OF THE GREAT MAJORITY IS ONLY A CONSTANT STRUGGLE FOR THIS EXISTENCE ITSELF WITH THE CERTAINTY OF LOSING IT AT LAST BUT WHAT ENABLES THEM TO ENDURE THIS WEARISOME BATTLE
7585-96245-0065 IS NOT SO MUCH THE LOVE OF LIFE AS THE FEAR OF DEATH WHICH YET STANDS IN THE BACKGROUND AS INEVITABLE AND MAY COME UPON THEM AT ANY MOMENT LIFE ITSELF IS A SEA
7585-96245-0066 BY DOING SO COMES NEARER AT EVERY STEP
7585-96245-0067 DEATH NAY EVEN STEERS RIGHT UPON IT THIS IS THE FINAL GOAL OF THE LABORIOUS VOYAGE AND WORSE FOR HIM THAN ALL THE ROCKS FROM WHICH HE HAS ESCAPED NOW
7585-96245-0068 IT IS WELL WORTH OBSERVING THAT ON THE ONE HAND THE SUFFERING AND MISERY OF LIFE MAY EASILY INCREASE TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT DEATH ITSELF IN THE FLIGHT FROM WHICH THE WHOLE OF LIFE CONSISTS BECOMES DESIRABLE
7585-96245-0069 AND WE HASTEN TOWARDS IT VOLUNTARILY AND AGAIN ON THE OTHER HAND THAT AS SOON AS WANT AND SUFFERING PERMIT REST TO A MAN
7585-96245-0070 REQUIRES DIVERSION THE STRIVING AFTER EXISTENCE IS WHAT OCCUPIES ALL LIVING THINGS AND MAINTAINS THEM IN MOTION BUT WHEN EXISTENCE IS ASSURED THEN THEY KNOW NOT WHAT TO DO WITH IT
7585-96245-0071 THUS THE SECOND THING THAT SETS THEM IN MOTION IS THE EFFORT TO GET FREE FROM THE BURDEN OF EXISTENCE TO MAKE IT CEASE TO BE FELT
7585-96245-0072 ACCORDINGLY WE SEE THAT ALMOST ALL MEN WHO ARE SECURE FROM WANT AND CARE NOW THAT AT LAST THEY HAVE THROWN OFF ALL OTHER BURDENS BECOME A BURDEN TO THEMSELVES
7585-96245-0073 AND REGARD AS A GAIN EVERY HOUR THEY SUCCEED IN GETTING THROUGH AND THUS EVERY DIMINUTION OF THE VERY LIFE WHICH TILL THEN THEY HAVE EMPLOYED ALL THEIR POWERS TO MAINTAIN AS LONG AS POSSIBLE
7585-96245-0074 IT MAKES BEINGS WHO LOVE EACH OTHER SO LITTLE AS MEN DO SEEK EACH OTHER EAGERLY AND THUS BECOMES THE SOURCE OF SOCIAL INTERCOURSE MOREOVER EVEN FROM MOTIVES OF POLICY
7585-96245-0075 PUBLIC PRECAUTIONS ARE EVERYWHERE TAKEN AGAINST IT AS AGAINST OTHER UNIVERSAL CALAMITIES FOR THIS EVIL MAY DRIVE MEN TO THE GREATEST EXCESSES JUST AS MUCH AS ITS OPPOSITE EXTREME
7585-96245-0076 THROUGH SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AND IDLENESS AND IT IS FOUND SO TERRIBLE THAT IT HAS EVEN LED PRISONERS TO COMMIT SUICIDE AS WANT IS THE CONSTANT SCOURGE OF THE PEOPLE
7585-96245-0077 AND WANT BY THE SIX WEEK DAYS THUS BETWEEN DESIRING AND ATTAINING ALL HUMAN LIFE FLOWS ON THROUGHOUT THE WISH IS IN ITS NATURE PAIN
7585-96245-0078 THE ATTAINMENT SOON BEGETS
7585-96245-0079 THE END WAS ONLY APPARENT POSSESSION TAKES AWAY THE CHARM THE WISH THE NEED PRESENTS ITSELF UNDER A NEW FORM
7585-96245-0080 THE CONFLICT IS JUST AS PAINFUL AS AGAINST WANT THAT WISH AND SATISFACTION SHOULD FOLLOW EACH OTHER NEITHER TOO QUICKLY NOR TOO SLOWLY REDUCES THE SUFFERING
7585-96245-0081 AND CONSTITUTES THE HAPPIEST LIFE
7585-96245-0082 BY A NATURE WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF OTHERS THUS HERE ALSO ACCOUNTS ARE SQUARED BUT TO THE GREAT MAJORITY OF MEN PURELY INTELLECTUAL PLEASURES ARE NOT ACCESSIBLE
7585-96245-0083 THEY ARE ALMOST QUITE INCAPABLE OF THE JOYS WHICH LIE IN PURE KNOWLEDGE THEY ARE ENTIRELY GIVEN UP TO WILLING IF THEREFORE ANYTHING IS TO WIN THEIR SYMPATHY TO BE INTERESTING TO THEM
7585-96245-0084 WE MAY FIND IN TRIFLES AND EVERYDAY OCCURRENCES THE NAIVE EXPRESSIONS OF THIS QUALITY THUS FOR EXAMPLE AT ANY PLACE WORTH SEEING THEY MAY VISIT THEY WRITE THEIR NAMES
7585-96245-0085 IN ORDER THUS TO REACT TO AFFECT THE PLACE SINCE IT DOES NOT AFFECT THEM AGAIN WHEN THEY SEE A STRANGE RARE ANIMAL THEY CANNOT EASILY CONFINE THEMSELVES TO MERELY OBSERVING IT
7585-96245-0086 THEY MUST ROUSE IT TEASE IT PLAY WITH IT MERELY TO EXPERIENCE ACTION AND REACTION BUT THIS NEED FOR EXCITEMENT OF THE WILL MANIFESTS ITSELF VERY SPECIALLY
7585-96245-0087 IN THE DISCOVERY AND SUPPORT OF CARD PLAYING WHICH IS QUITE PECULIARLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE MISERABLE SIDE
7585-96245-0088 WANT CARE FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF LIFE IF WE SUCCEED WHICH IS VERY DIFFICULT IN REMOVING PAIN IN THIS FORM IT IMMEDIATELY ASSUMES A THOUSAND OTHERS VARYING
7585-96245-0089 ACCORDING TO AGE AND CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS LUST PASSIONATE LOVE JEALOUSY ENVY HATRED ANXIETY
7585-96245-0090 AGAINST WHICH WE THEN STRIVE IN VARIOUS WAYS IF FINALLY WE SUCCEED IN DRIVING THIS AWAY WE SHALL HARDLY DO SO WITHOUT LETTING PAIN ENTER IN ONE OF ITS EARLIER FORMS
7585-96245-0091 AND THE DANCE BEGIN AGAIN FROM THE BEGINNING FOR ALL HUMAN LIFE IS TOSSED BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BETWEEN
7585-96245-0092 DEPRESSING AS THIS VIEW OF LIFE IS I WILL DRAW ATTENTION BY THE WAY TO AN ASPECT OF IT FROM WHICH CONSOLATION MAY BE DRAWN
7585-96245-0093 AND PERHAPS EVEN A STOICAL INDIFFERENCE TO ONE'S OWN PRESENT ILLS MAY BE ATTAINED FOR OUR IMPATIENCE
7585-96245-0094 AND QUITE UNIVERSAL FOR EXAMPLE THE NECESSITY OF AGE AND OF DEATH AND MANY DAILY INCONVENIENCES
7585-96245-0095 IT IS RATHER THE CONSIDERATION OF THE ACCIDENTAL NATURE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT BROUGHT SOME SORROW JUST TO US THAT GIVES IT ITS STING
7585-96245-0096 BUT IF WE HAVE RECOGNISED THAT PAIN AS SUCH IS INEVITABLE AND ESSENTIAL TO LIFE AND THAT NOTHING DEPENDS UPON CHANCE BUT ITS MERE FASHION THE FORM UNDER WHICH IT PRESENTS ITSELF
7585-96245-0097 WOULD AT ONCE BE OCCUPIED BY ANOTHER WHICH NOW IS EXCLUDED BY IT AND THAT THEREFORE FATE CAN AFFECT US LITTLE IN WHAT IS ESSENTIAL
7585-96245-0098 BUT IN FACT SUCH A POWERFUL CONTROL OF REASON OVER DIRECTLY FELT SUFFERING SELDOM OR NEVER OCCURS BESIDES THROUGH THIS VIEW OF THE INEVITABLENESS OF PAIN
7585-96245-0099 OF THE SUPPLANTING OF ONE PAIN BY ANOTHER AND THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW PAIN THROUGH THE PASSING AWAY OF THAT WHICH PRECEDED IT ONE MIGHT BE LED TO THE PARADOXICAL BUT NOT ABSURD HYPOTHESIS
7585-96245-0100 NOR BE MORE THAN FILLED HOWEVER MUCH THE FORM OF THE SUFFERING MIGHT CHANGE THUS HIS SUFFERING AND WELL BEING WOULD BY NO MEANS BE DETERMINED FROM WITHOUT BUT ONLY THROUGH THAT MEASURE
7585-96245-0101 THAT NATURAL DISPOSITION WHICH INDEED MIGHT EXPERIENCE CERTAIN ADDITIONS AND DIMINUTIONS FROM THE PHYSICAL CONDITION AT DIFFERENT TIMES BUT YET ON THE WHOLE WOULD REMAIN THE SAME
7585-96245-0102 ACTUALLY BEFALLS US AS SOON AS WE HAVE OVERCOME THE FIRST PAIN OF IT OUR DISPOSITION REMAINS FOR THE MOST PART UNCHANGED AND CONVERSELY
7585-96245-0103 THAT AFTER THE ATTAINMENT OF SOME HAPPINESS WE HAVE LONG DESIRED WE DO NOT FEEL OURSELVES ON THE WHOLE AND PERMANENTLY VERY MUCH BETTER OFF AND AGREEABLY SITUATED THAN BEFORE
7585-96245-0104 ONLY THE MOMENT AT WHICH THESE CHANGES OCCUR AFFECTS US WITH UNUSUAL STRENGTH AS DEEP SORROW OR EXULTING JOY BUT BOTH SOON PASS AWAY FOR THEY ARE BASED UPON ILLUSION
7585-96245-0105 FOR THEY DO NOT SPRING
7585-96245-0106 NEW FUTURE WHICH IS ANTICIPATED IN THEM ONLY BY BORROWING FROM THE FUTURE COULD PAIN OR PLEASURE BE HEIGHTENED SO ABNORMALLY AND CONSEQUENTLY NOT ENDURINGLY
7585-96245-0107 IT WOULD FOLLOW FROM THE HYPOTHESIS ADVANCED THAT A LARGE PART OF THE FEELING OF SUFFERING AND OF WELL BEING WOULD BE SUBJECTIVE AND DETERMINED A PRIORI AS IS THE CASE WITH KNOWING
7585-96245-0108 AND WE MAY ADD THE FOLLOWING REMARKS AS EVIDENCE IN FAVOUR OF IT HUMAN CHEERFULNESS OR DEJECTION ARE MANIFESTLY NOT DETERMINED BY EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS WEALTH AND POSITION
7585-96245-0109 FOR WE SEE AT LEAST AS MANY GLAD FACES AMONG THE POOR AS AMONG THE RICH FURTHER THE MOTIVES WHICH INDUCE SUICIDE ARE SO VERY DIFFERENT THAT WE CAN ASSIGN
7585-96245-0110 NO MOTIVE THAT IS SO GREAT AS TO BRING IT ABOUT EVEN WITH GREAT PROBABILITY IN EVERY CHARACTER AND FEW THAT WOULD BE SO SMALL THAT THE LIKE OF THEM HAD NEVER CAUSED IT
7585-96245-0111 BUT TO THAT OF THE INNER CONDITION THE PHYSICAL STATE
7585-96245-0112 EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF JOYFULNESS TAKES PLACE IT USUALLY APPEARS WITHOUT ANY EXTERNAL OCCASION IT IS TRUE THAT WE OFTEN SEE OUR PAIN ARISE ONLY FROM SOME DEFINITE EXTERNAL RELATION
7585-96245-0113 AND ARE VISIBLY OPPRESSED AND SADDENED BY THIS ONLY THEN WE BELIEVE THAT IF ONLY THIS WERE TAKEN AWAY THE GREATEST CONTENTMENT WOULD NECESSARILY ENSUE BUT THIS IS ILLUSION
7585-96245-0114 THE MEASURE OF OUR PAIN AND OUR HAPPINESS IS ON THE WHOLE ACCORDING TO OUR HYPOTHESIS SUBJECTIVELY DETERMINED FOR EACH POINT OF TIME AND THE MOTIVE FOR SADNESS IS RELATED TO THAT
7585-96245-0115 JUST AS A BLISTER WHICH DRAWS TO A HEAD ALL THE BAD HUMOURS OTHERWISE DISTRIBUTED IS RELATED TO THE BODY
7585-96245-0116 THE PAIN WHICH IS AT THAT PERIOD OF TIME ESSENTIAL TO OUR NATURE AND THEREFORE CANNOT BE SHAKEN OFF WOULD WITHOUT THE DEFINITE EXTERNAL CAUSE OF OUR SUFFERING BE DIVIDED AT A HUNDRED POINTS
7585-96245-0117 AND APPEAR IN THE FORM OF A HUNDRED LITTLE ANNOYANCES AND CARES ABOUT THINGS WHICH WE NOW ENTIRELY OVERLOOK BECAUSE OUR CAPACITY FOR PAIN IS ALREADY FILLED BY THAT CHIEF EVIL
7585-96245-0118 WHICH HAS CONCENTRATED IN A POINT ALL THE SUFFERING OTHERWISE DISPERSED THIS CORRESPONDS ALSO TO THE OBSERVATION THAT IF A GREAT AND PRESSING CARE IS LIFTED FROM OUR BREAST BY
7585-96245-0119 ITS FORTUNATE ISSUE ANOTHER IMMEDIATELY TAKES ITS PLACE THE WHOLE MATERIAL OF WHICH WAS ALREADY THERE BEFORE YET COULD NOT COME INTO CONSCIOUSNESS AS CARE BECAUSE
7585-96245-0120 THERE WAS NO CAPACITY LEFT FOR IT AND THEREFORE THIS MATERIAL OF CARE REMAINED INDISTINCT AND UNOBSERVED IN A CLOUDY FORM ON THE FARTHEST
7585-96245-0121 AS THE CHIEF CARE OF THE DAY COMPLETELY FILLS THE THRONE EXCESSIVE JOY AND VERY KEEN SUFFERING ALWAYS OCCUR IN THE SAME PERSON FOR THEY CONDITION EACH OTHER RECIPROCALLY
7585-96245-0122 AND ARE ALSO IN COMMON CONDITIONED BY GREAT ACTIVITY OF THE MIND BOTH ARE PRODUCED AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN NOT BY WHAT IS REALLY PRESENT BUT BY THE ANTICIPATION OF THE FUTURE
7585-96245-0123 BUT SINCE PAIN IS ESSENTIAL TO LIFE AND ITS DEGREE IS ALSO DETERMINED BY THE NATURE OF THE SUBJECT SUDDEN CHANGES BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS EXTERNAL CANNOT REALLY ALTER ITS DEGREE
7585-96245-0124 THUS AN ERROR AND DELUSION ALWAYS LIES AT THE FOUNDATION OF IMMODERATE JOY OR GRIEF AND CONSEQUENTLY BOTH THESE EXCESSIVE STRAININGS OF THE MIND CAN BE AVOIDED BY KNOWLEDGE
7585-96245-0125 EVERY IMMODERATE JOY EXULTATIO INSOLENS
7585-96245-0126 ALWAYS RESTS ON THE DELUSION THAT ONE HAS FOUND IN LIFE WHAT CAN NEVER BE FOUND THERE LASTING SATISFACTION OF THE HARASSING DESIRES AND CARES WHICH ARE CONSTANTLY BREEDING NEW ONES
7585-96245-0127 FROM EVERY PARTICULAR DELUSION OF THIS KIND ONE MUST INEVITABLY BE BROUGHT BACK LATER AND THEN WHEN IT VANISHES MUST PAY FOR IT WITH PAIN
7585-96245-0128 AS THE JOY ITS ENTRANCE CAUSED WAS KEEN SO FAR THEN IT IS PRECISELY LIKE A HEIGHT FROM WHICH ONE CAN COME DOWN ONLY BY A FALL
7585-96245-0129 THEREFORE ONE OUGHT TO AVOID THEM AND EVERY SUDDEN EXCESSIVE GRIEF IS
7585-96245-0130 THE VANISHING OF SUCH A DELUSION AND SO CONDITIONED BY IT CONSEQUENTLY WE MIGHT AVOID THEM BOTH IF WE HAD SUFFICIENT CONTROL OVER OURSELVES TO SURVEY THINGS ALWAYS
7585-96245-0131 WITH PERFECT CLEARNESS AS A WHOLE AND IN THEIR CONNECTION AND STEADFASTLY TO GUARD AGAINST REALLY LENDING THEM THE COLOURS WHICH WE WISH THEY HAD THE PRINCIPAL
7585-96245-0132 EVERY ONE CARRIES ABOUT WITH HIM ITS PERENNIAL SOURCE IN HIS OWN HEART WE RATHER SEEK CONSTANTLY FOR AN EXTERNAL PARTICULAR CAUSE AS IT WERE
7585-96245-0133 A PRETEXT FOR THE PAIN WHICH NEVER LEAVES US JUST AS THE FREE MAN MAKES HIMSELF AN IDOL IN ORDER TO HAVE A MASTER FOR WE UNWEARIEDLY STRIVE FROM WISH TO WISH
7585-96245-0134 AND ALTHOUGH EVERY SATISFACTION HOWEVER MUCH IT PROMISED WHEN ATTAINED FAILS TO SATISFY US BUT FOR THE MOST PART COMES PRESENTLY TO BE AN ERROR OF WHICH WE ARE ASHAMED
7585-96245-0135 YET WE DO NOT SEE THAT WE DRAW WATER WITH THE SIEVE OF THE
7585-96245-0136 BUT EVER HASTEN TO NEW DESIRES
7585-96245-0137 CAETERA POST ALIUD
7585-96245-0138 OR WHAT IS MORE RARE AND PRESUPPOSES A CERTAIN STRENGTH OF CHARACTER TILL WE REACH A WISH WHICH IS NOT SATISFIED AND YET CANNOT BE GIVEN UP
7585-96245-0139 IN THAT CASE WE HAVE AS IT WERE FOUND WHAT WE SOUGHT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALWAYS BLAME INSTEAD OF OUR OWN NATURE AS THE SOURCE OF OUR SUFFERING
7585-96245-0140 AND THUS ALTHOUGH
7585-96245-0141 AT VARIANCE WITH OUR FATE WE ARE RECONCILED TO OUR EXISTENCE FOR THE KNOWLEDGE IS AGAIN PUT FAR FROM US THAT SUFFERING IS ESSENTIAL TO THIS EXISTENCE ITSELF
7585-96245-0142 AND THE CONTEMPT FOR ALL LESSER SORROWS OR JOYS THAT PROCEEDS FROM IT CONSEQUENTLY AN ALREADY NOBLER PHENOMENON THAN THAT CONSTANT SEIZING UPON EVER NEW FORMS OF ILLUSION
