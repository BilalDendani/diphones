4712-49746-0000 THE LAY OF THE DOLOROUS KNIGHT MY HARPER CALLED HIS SONG BUT OF THOSE WHO HEARKENED SOME NAMED IT RATHER THE LAY OF THE FOUR SORROWS IN NANTES OF BRITTANY
4712-49746-0001 THERE DWELT A DAME WHO WAS DEARLY HELD OF ALL FOR REASON OF THE MUCH GOOD THAT WAS FOUND IN HER THIS LADY WAS PASSING FAIR OF BODY APT IN BOOK AS ANY CLERK AND MEETLY SCHOOLED IN EVERY GRACE THAT IT BECOMETH DAME TO HAVE
4712-49746-0002 SO GRACIOUS OF PERSON WAS THIS DAMSEL THAT THROUGHOUT THE REALM THERE WAS NO KNIGHT COULD REFRAIN FROM SETTING HIS HEART UPON HER THOUGH HE SAW HER BUT ONE ONLY TIME ALTHOUGH THE DEMOISELLE MIGHT NOT RETURN THE LOVE OF SO MANY CERTAINLY SHE HAD NO WISH TO SLAY THEM ALL
4712-49746-0003 BETTER BY FAR THAT A MAN PRAY AND REQUIRE IN LOVE ALL THE DAMES OF HIS COUNTRY THAN RUN MAD IN WOODS FOR THE BRIGHT EYES OF ONE THEREFORE THIS DAME GAVE COURTESY
4712-49746-0004 EVEN WHEN SHE MIGHT NOT HEAR A LOVER'S WORDS SO SWEETLY SHE DENIED HIS WISH THAT THE MORE HE HELD HER DEAR AND WAS THE MORE HER SERVANT FOR THAT FOND DENIAL SO BECAUSE OF HER GREAT RICHES OF BODY AND OF HEART THIS LADY OF WHOM I TELL
4712-49746-0005 WAS PRAYED AND REQUIRED IN LOVE BY THE LORDS OF HER COUNTRY BOTH BY NIGHT AND BY DAY NOW IN BRITTANY LIVED FOUR YOUNG BARONS BUT THEIR NAMES I CANNOT TELL IT IS ENOUGH THAT THEY WERE DESIRABLE IN THE EYES OF MAIDENS FOR REASON OF THEIR BEAUTY
4712-49746-0006 AND THAT MEN ESTEEMED THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE COURTEOUS OF MANNER AND OPEN OF HAND MOREOVER THEY WERE STOUT AND HARDY KNIGHTS AMONGST THE SPEARS AND RICH AND WORTHY GENTLEMEN OF THOSE VERY PARTS EACH OF THESE FOUR KNIGHTS HAD SET HIS HEART UPON THE LADY
4712-49746-0007 AND FOR LOVE OF HER PAINED HIMSELF MIGHTILY AND DID ALL THAT HE WAS ABLE SO THAT BY ANY MEANS HE MIGHT GAIN HER FAVOUR EACH PRAYED HER PRIVILY FOR HER LOVE AND STROVE ALL THAT HE COULD TO MAKE HIM WORTHY OF THE GIFT ABOVE HIS FELLOWS
4712-49746-0008 FOR HER PART THE LADY WAS SORE PERPLEXED AND CONSIDERED IN HER MIND VERY EARNESTLY WHICH OF THESE FOUR KNIGHTS SHE SHOULD TAKE AS FRIEND
4712-49746-0009 FOR SHE WOULD NOT SLAY THREE LOVERS WITH HER HAND SO THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE CONTENT
4712-49746-0010 GIFTS SHE GAVE TO ALL ALIKE TENDER MESSAGES SHE SENT TO EACH EVERY KNIGHT DEEMED HIMSELF ESTEEMED AND FAVOURED ABOVE HIS FELLOWS AND BY SOFT WORDS AND FAIR SERVICE
4712-49746-0011 WHEN THE KNIGHTS GATHERED TOGETHER FOR THE GAMES EACH OF THESE LORDS CONTENDED EARNESTLY FOR THE PRIZE SO THAT HE MIGHT BE FIRST AND DRAW ON HIM THE FAVOUR OF HIS DAME EACH HELD HER FOR HIS FRIEND EACH BORE UPON HIM HER GIFT PENNON OR SLEEVE OR RING
4712-49746-0012 EACH CRIED HER NAME WITHIN THE LISTS NOW WHEN EASTERTIDE WAS COME A GREAT TOURNAMENT WAS PROCLAIMED TO BE HELD BEYOND THE WALLS OF NANTES THAT RICH CITY THE FOUR LOVERS WERE THE APPELLANTS IN THIS TOURNEY
4712-49746-0013 AND FROM EVERY REALM KNIGHTS RODE TO BREAK A LANCE IN HONOUR OF THEIR DAME FRENCHMAN AND NORMAN AND FLEMING THE HARDIEST KNIGHTS OF BRABANT BOULOGNE AND ANJOU EACH CAME TO DO HIS DEVOIR IN THE FIELD
4712-49746-0014 NOR WAS THE CHIVALRY OF NANTES BACKWARD IN THIS QUARREL BUT TILL THE VESPERS OF THE TOURNAMENT WAS COME THEY STAYED THEMSELVES WITHIN THE LISTS AND STRUCK STOUTLY FOR THEIR LORD AFTER THE FOUR LOVERS HAD LACED THEIR HARNESS UPON THEM
4712-49746-0015 THEY ISSUED FORTH FROM THE CITY FOLLOWED BY THE KNIGHTS WHO WERE OF THEIR COMPANY IN THIS ADVENTURE BUT UPON THE FOUR FELL THE BURDEN OF THE DAY FOR THEY WERE KNOWN OF ALL BY THE EMBROIDERED ARMS UPON THEIR SURCOAT AND THE DEVICE FASHIONED ON THE SHIELD
4712-49746-0016 NOW AGAINST THE FOUR LOVERS ARRAYED THEMSELVES FOUR OTHER KNIGHTS ARMED ALTOGETHER IN COATS OF MAIL AND HELMETS AND GAUNTLETS OF STEEL OF THESE STRANGER KNIGHTS TWO WERE OF HAINAULT AND THE TWO OTHERS WERE FLEMINGS
4712-49746-0017 WHEN THE FOUR LOVERS SAW THEIR ADVERSARIES PREPARE THEMSELVES FOR THE COMBAT THEY HAD LITTLE DESIRE TO FLEE BUT HASTENED TO JOIN THEM IN BATTLE EACH LOWERED HIS SPEAR AND CHOOSING HIS ENEMY MET HIM SO EAGERLY THAT ALL MEN WONDERED
4712-49746-0018 BUT FREEING THEIR FEET FROM THE STIRRUPS BENT OVER THE FALLEN FOE AND CALLED ON HIM TO YIELD WHEN THE FRIENDS OF THE VANQUISHED KNIGHTS SAW THEIR CASE THEY HASTENED TO THEIR SUCCOUR SO FOR THEIR RESCUE THERE WAS A GREAT PRESS AND MANY A MIGHTY STROKE WITH THE SWORD
4712-49746-0019 THE DAMSEL STOOD UPON A TOWER TO WATCH THESE FEATS OF ARMS BY THEIR BLAZONED COATS AND SHIELDS SHE KNEW HER KNIGHTS SHE SAW THEIR MARVELLOUS DEEDS YET MIGHT NOT SAY WHO DID BEST NOR GIVE TO ONE THE PRAISE BUT THE TOURNAMENT WAS NO LONGER A SEEMLY AND ORDERED BATTLE
4712-49746-0020 THE RANKS OF THE TWO COMPANIES WERE CONFUSED TOGETHER SO THAT EVERY MAN FOUGHT AGAINST HIS FELLOW
4712-49746-0021 SO THAT ALL MEN DEEMED THEM WORTHY OF THE PRIZE BUT WHEN EVENING WAS COME AND THE SPORT DREW TO ITS CLOSE THEIR COURAGE LED THEM TO FOLLY HAVING VENTURED TOO FAR FROM THEIR COMPANIONS
4712-49746-0022 THEY WERE SET UPON BY THEIR ADVERSARIES AND ASSAILED SO FIERCELY THAT THREE WERE SLAIN OUTRIGHT AS TO THE FOURTH HE YET LIVED BUT ALTOGETHER MAULED AND SHAKEN FOR HIS THIGH WAS BROKEN AND A SPEAR HEAD REMAINED IN HIS SIDE
4712-49746-0023 THE FOUR BODIES WERE FALLEN ON THE FIELD AND LAY WITH THOSE WHO HAD PERISHED IN THAT DAY BUT BECAUSE OF THE GREAT MISCHIEF THESE FOUR LOVERS HAD DONE THEIR ADVERSARIES THEIR SHIELDS WERE CAST DESPITEFULLY WITHOUT THE LISTS BUT IN THIS THEIR FOEMEN DID WRONGFULLY
4712-49746-0024 AND ALL MEN HELD THEM IN SORE DISPLEASURE GREAT WERE THE LAMENTATION AND THE CRY WHEN THE NEWS OF THIS MISCHANCE WAS NOISED ABOUT THE CITY SUCH A TUMULT OF MOURNING WAS NEVER BEFORE HEARD FOR THE WHOLE CITY WAS MOVED
4712-49746-0025 MEETLY TO MOURN THE DEAD THERE RODE NIGH UPON TWO THOUSAND KNIGHTS WITH HAUBERKS UNLACED AND UNCOVERED HEADS PLUCKING UPON THEIR BEARDS SO THE FOUR LOVERS WERE PLACED EACH UPON HIS SHIELD AND BEING BROUGHT BACK IN HONOUR TO NANTES
4712-49746-0026 WERE CARRIED TO THE HOUSE OF THAT DAME WHOM SO GREATLY THEY HAD LOVED WHEN THE LADY KNEW THIS DISTRESSFUL ADVENTURE STRAIGHTWAY SHE FELL TO THE GROUND BEING RETURNED FROM HER SWOON SHE MADE HER COMPLAINT CALLING UPON HER LOVERS EACH BY HIS NAME ALAS SAID SHE
4712-49746-0027 WHAT SHALL I DO FOR NEVER SHALL I KNOW HAPPINESS AGAIN THESE FOUR KNIGHTS HAD SET THEIR HEARTS UPON ME AND DESPITE THEIR GREAT TREASURE ESTEEMED MY LOVE AS RICHER THAN ALL THEIR WEALTH ALAS FOR THE FAIR AND VALIANT KNIGHT ALAS FOR THE LOYAL AND GENEROUS MAN
4712-49746-0028 BUT HOW MIGHT LADY BEREAVE THREE OF LIFE SO AS TO CHERISH ONE EVEN NOW I CANNOT TELL FOR WHOM I HAVE MOST PITY OR WHO WAS CLOSEST TO MY MIND BUT THREE ARE DEAD AND ONE IS SORE STRICKEN NEITHER IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE WORLD WHICH CAN BRING ME COMFORT
4712-49746-0029 ONLY THIS IS THERE TO DO TO GIVE THE SLAIN MEN SEEMLY BURIAL AND IF IT MAY BE TO HEAL THEIR COMRADE OF HIS WOUNDS SO BECAUSE OF HER GREAT LOVE AND NOBLENESS
4712-49746-0030 THE LADY CAUSED THESE THREE DISTRESSFUL KNIGHTS TO BE BURIED WELL AND WORSHIPFULLY IN A RICH ABBEY IN THAT PLACE SHE OFFERED THEIR MASS PENNY AND GAVE RICH OFFERINGS OF SILVER AND OF LIGHTS BESIDES MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON THEM IN THAT DAY
4712-49746-0031 AS FOR THE WOUNDED KNIGHT SHE COMMANDED HIM TO BE CARRIED TO HER OWN CHAMBER SHE SENT FOR SURGEONS AND GAVE HIM INTO THEIR HANDS THESE SEARCHED HIS WOUNDS SO SKILFULLY AND TENDED HIM WITH SO GREAT CARE THAT PRESENTLY HIS HURT COMMENCED TO HEAL
4712-49746-0032 YET EVER SHE FELT PITY FOR THE THREE KNIGHTS OF THE SORROWS AND EVER SHE WENT HEAVILY BY REASON OF THEIR DEATHS NOW ON A SUMMER'S DAY THE LADY AND THE KNIGHT SAT TOGETHER AFTER MEAT SHE CALLED TO MIND THE SORROW THAT WAS HERS SO THAT IN A SPACE
