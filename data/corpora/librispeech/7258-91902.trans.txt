7258-91902-0000 JESUS AS GOD
7258-91902-0001 HAVE EVEN HAD THE HEART TO DEGRADE THIS FIRST PREACHER OF THE MOUNTAIN THE PUREST HERO OF LIBERTY FOR UNABLE TO DENY THAT HE WAS EARTH'S GREATEST MAN THEY HAVE MADE OF HIM HEAVEN'S SMALLEST GOD
7258-91902-0002 AND THE CHARACTER WHEREIN IT HAS BEEN FOUNDED TAKING AWAY ALL TRUE GRANDEUR FROM JESUS BENUMBING OUR LOVE AND REVERENCE JESUS AS A MAN COMMANDS MY HEART'S BEST HOMAGE
7258-91902-0003 HIS WORDS AS REPORTED BY THE EVANGELISTS ARE EVER FLOWING FOUNTAINS OF SPIRITUAL REFRESHMENTS AND I FEEL THAT HE WAS IN HIMSELF EVEN FAR MORE WISE AND GOOD THAN HE APPEARS IN THE GOSPEL
7258-91902-0004 WHAT DISCIPLE COULD BE EXPECTED TO REPORT PERFECTLY THE WORDS OF A TEACHER SO MYSTICALLY SUBLIME THE DISCIPLE INTENDS AND ENDEAVORS TO REPORT FAITHFULLY
7258-91902-0005 BUT WHEN HE HEARS WORDS WHICH TO HIM ARE WITHOUT SENSE BECAUSE THEY EXPRESS SOME TRUTH WHOSE SPHERE IS BEYOND THE REACH OF HIS VISION HE MAKES SENSE OF THEM BY SOME SLIGHT CHANGE SLIGHT
7258-91902-0006 AS TO THE LETTER IMMENSE AS TO THE SPIRIT FOR THE SENSE IS A TRUTH OR TRUISM OF HIS OWN LOWER SPHERE
7258-91902-0007 AND WHEN THE REPORTS ARE NOT PUT INTO WRITING UNTIL MANY YEARS AFTER THE WORDS WERE FIRST UTTERED THE CHANGES WILL BE IMPORTANT EVEN AS TO THE LETTER FOR A NARRATIVE
7258-91902-0008 ALWAYS ALTERS YEAR AFTER YEAR AS MUCH AS THE MAN HIMSELF ALTERS FOR HE CONTINUES GRAFTING HIS OWN SENSE WHICH MAY BE DEPLORABLE NONSENSE UPON WORDS WHICH HAVE BEEN SPOKEN
7258-91902-0009 WHEN WE FIND SENTENCES OF THE PUREST BEAUTY AND WISDOM IN THE RECORDS OF A MAN'S CONVERSATION WE MAY SAFELY PROPORTION THE WHOLE PHILOSOPHICAL CHARACTER OF THE SPEAKER TO SUCH SENTENCES THEY MARK THE ALTITUDE
7258-91902-0010 AT WHICH HIS SPIRIT LOVED TO DWELL WE ARE BUT COMPLETING THE CIRCLE FROM THE CLEAREST FRAGMENT ARC LEFT
7258-91902-0011 HAVE PERHAPS BEEN DEGRADED BY THE REPORTER
7258-91902-0012 JESUS AS A MAN WHOSE WORDS HAVE BEEN RECORDED BY FALLIBLE MEN IS NOT LOWERED IN MY ESTEEM BY SUCH CONTRADICTIONS AS I FIND BETWEEN HIS VARIOUS SPEECHES EVERY PROVERB
7258-91902-0013 HAS ITS ANTAGONIST PROVERB EACH BEING TRUE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT OR IN CERTAIN RELATIONS COULD WE CONCEIVE AN ABSTRACT INTELLECT WE MIGHT CONCEIVE IT DWELLING CONTINUALLY
7258-91902-0014 LIVES IN THE RELATIVE AND THE CONDITIONED AND NATURALLY REFLECTS THE CHARACTER OF THIS SPHERE THE WISE MAN FINDS HIMSELF SURROUNDED AND OBSTRUCTED BY CERTAIN CONCRETE ERRORS
7258-91902-0015 HAD HE LIVED IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES FOR A WISE MAN ONLY ATTACKS THE ERRORS THAT ARE IN HIS WAY THINGS WHICH HE NEVER MEETS HE CAN SCARCELY THINK OF AS OBSTRUCTIONS
7258-91902-0016 HE IS ROLLING OFF ON THE RIGHT YOU PUSH HIM UP HE THEN ROLLS OVER ON THE LEFT EXACTLY SO AND BECAUSE ONE SAGE SEEING HIM ROLL DOWN TO THE RIGHT HAS PUSHED HIM UP ON THE RIGHT WHILE ANOTHER SAGE
7258-91902-0017 SEEING HIM ROLL DOWN TO THE LEFT HAS PUSHED HIM UP ON THE LEFT ARE THE TWO SAGES TO BE ACCOUNTED ANTAGONISTS NOW AS A WISE MAN IN THE COURSE OF HIS EXISTENCE MEETS ERRORS OF MANY SORTS
7258-91902-0018 AND DEITY REPORTS THE SPEECHES ALL SHOULD BE ABSOLUTE TRUTH TRANSPARENTLY SELF CONSISTENT ELSE WHAT ADVANTAGE OR GAIN HAVE WE BY THE SUBSTITUTION OF GOD FOR MAN
7258-91902-0019 WHY BRING IN GOD TO UTTER AND RECORD WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN AS WELL UTTERED AND RECORDED BY MAN EVERYTHING FOR WHICH WE LOVE AND VENERATE THE MAN JESUS BECOMES A BITTER AND ABSURD MOCKERY WHEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE LORD CHRIST
7258-91902-0020 HE CURED MANY SICK IF GOD WHY DID HE NOT GIVE THE WHOLE WORLD HEALTH HE ASSOCIATED WITH PUBLICANS AND SINNERS IF GOD WHY DID HE MAKE PUBLICANS AND SINNERS AT ALL
7258-91902-0021 HE PREACHED THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IF GOD WHY DID HE NOT BRING THE KINGDOM WITH HIM AND MAKE ALL MANKIND FIT FOR IT HE LOVED THE POOR HE TAUGHT THE IGNORANT IF GOD
7258-91902-0022 WHY DID HE LET ANY REMAIN POOR AND IGNORANT HE REBUKED THE PHARISEES AND SADDUCEES IT GOD WHY DID HE NOT WHOLLY PURIFY THEM FROM FORMALISM HYPOCRISY AND UNBELIEF
7258-91902-0023 IF GOD WHY DID HE NOT RESTORE MANKIND TO HIMSELF WITHOUT DYING AND WHAT GREAT THING WAS IT TO SEEM TO DIE FOR THREE DAYS HE SENT APOSTLES TO PREACH SALVATION TO ALL MEN
7258-91902-0024 IF GOD WHY DID HE NOT REVEAL IT AT ONCE TO ALL MEN AND SO REVEAL IT THAT DOUBT HAD BEEN IMPOSSIBLE HE LIVED AN EXAMPLE OF HOLINESS TO US ALL IF GOD
7258-91902-0025 HOW CAN OUR HUMANITY IMITATE DEITY AND FINALLY A QUESTION TRAMPLING DOWN EVERY ASSERTION IN HIS FAVOR
7258-91902-0026 ONE IS ASHAMED OF REPEATING THESE THINGS FOR THE TEN THOUSANDTH TIME BUT THEY WILL HAVE TO BE REPEATED OCCASIONALLY
7258-91902-0027 I AM CONTENT TO NOTE ONE ASPECT OF THIS UNFORTUNATE MYSTERY WHICH SO FAR AS I AM AWARE HAS BEEN SELDOM STUDIED THE WHOLE SCHEME OF THE ATONEMENT AS PLANNED BY GOD IS BASED UPON A CRIME
7258-91902-0028 IF ALL THESE TURPITUDES HAD NOT BEEN SECURED THE ATONEMENT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONSUMMATED NEED ONE SAY MORE SOMETIMES WHEN MUSING UPON THIS DOCTRINE
7258-91902-0029 I HAVE A VISION OF THE GOD MAN GETTING OLD UPON THE EARTH HORRIBLY ANXIOUS AND WRETCHED BECAUSE NO ONE WILL MURDER HIM JUDAS HAS SUCCEEDED TO A LARGE PROPERTY AND WOULD NOT BE TEMPTED TO BETRAY HIM BY THREE HUNDRED PIECES OF SILVER
7258-91902-0030 THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS THINK HIM INSANE AND THEREFORE AS ORIENTALS HOLD HIM IN A CERTAIN REVERENCE
7258-91902-0031 IS HENPECKED AND SUPERSTITIOUS
7258-91902-0032 AND WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM EVEN PETER WON'T DENY HIM ALTHOUGH HE HAS RESTORED PETER'S MOTHER IN LAW TO LIFE THE SITUATION IS DESPERATE
7258-91902-0033 MAY HE BE COMPELLED TO COMMIT SUICIDE MUST HE GO BACK TO HEAVEN UNSACRIFICED FOILED FOR WANT OF AN ASSASSIN BENJAMIN DISRAELI ATTAINED THE CYNICAL SUBLIME WHEN HE SUGGESTED
7258-91902-0034 THE HEAVENLY TRINITY WOULD NOT HAVE TRIUMPHED IN THE SCHEME OF SALVATION BY ATONEMENT JUDAS CAIAPHAS
7258-91902-0035 AND AS THESE THREE MEN COULD NOT HAVE DONE WHAT THEY DID IN FURTHERANCE OF THE GLORIOUS WORK WITHOUT A WELL KNOWN INSPIRATION A FOURTH MEMORIAL THE GRANDEST OF ALL SHOULD HAVE BEEN ERECTED TO THE DEVIL
7258-91902-0036 BUT THE WORLD EVEN THE RELIGIOUS WORLD HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNGRATEFUL TO ITS MOST GENEROUS BENEFACTORS IS IT NOT THE WORST OF SACRILEGE A FOUL PROFANATION OF OUR HUMAN NATURE
7258-91902-0037 THE PEOPLE WHO PROFESS BELIEF IN THIS ARE SHOCKED AT THE OUTRAGE OFFERED TO OUR HUMANITY BY THE DEVELOPMENT THEORY WHILE THEY THEMSELVES COMMIT THIS OUTRAGE MORE FLAGITIOUS LITTLE MATTERS WHENCE WE SPRANG
7258-91902-0038 WE ARE WHAT WE ARE BUT MUCH MATTERS TO WHAT WE MAY ATTAIN IF THE DEVELOPMENT THEORY PLANTS OUR FEET IN THE SLIME THE CHRISTIAN THEORY BOWS OUR HEAD TO THE DUST
7258-91902-0039 IT ASSERTS THAT HUMAN NATURE COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE SO GOOD AS JESUS THAT HUMAN GENIUS COULD NOT POSSIBLY WRITE THE BOOKS WHICH TELL OF HIM IT DENIES US OUR NOBLEST PREROGATIVES
7258-91902-0040 YET THE ORTHODOX SHUDDER AND MOAN OUTRAGED IN THEIR PIOUS SENSIBILITIES WHEN ONE DARES TO SPEAK WITH MANLY PLAINNESS OF THEIR DOCTRINES WHICH COMMENCE BY POLLUTING OUR COMMON NATURE
