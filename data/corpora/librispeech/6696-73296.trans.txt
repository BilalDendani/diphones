6696-73296-0000 MY POOR DEAR ISABELLA SAID HE FONDLY TAKING HER HAND AND INTERRUPTING FOR A FEW MOMENTS HER BUSY LABORS FOR SOME ONE OF HER FIVE CHILDREN HOW LONG IT IS HOW TERRIBLY LONG SINCE YOU WERE HERE
6696-73296-0001 KNOWING AS SHE DID THAT BOTH THE MISTER KNIGHTLEYS WERE AS UNPERSUADABLE ON THAT ARTICLE AS HERSELF AND TWO BASINS ONLY WERE ORDERED AFTER A LITTLE MORE DISCOURSE IN PRAISE OF GRUEL WITH SOME WONDERING AT ITS NOT BEING TAKEN EVERY EVENING BY EVERYBODY
6696-73296-0002 HE PROCEEDED TO SAY WITH AN AIR OF GRAVE REFLECTION IT WAS AN AWKWARD BUSINESS MY DEAR YOUR SPENDING THE AUTUMN AT SOUTH END INSTEAD OF COMING HERE I NEVER HAD MUCH OPINION OF THE SEA AIR
6696-73296-0003 MISTER WINGFIELD MOST STRENUOUSLY RECOMMENDED IT SIR OR WE SHOULD NOT HAVE GONE HE RECOMMENDED IT FOR ALL THE CHILDREN BUT PARTICULARLY FOR THE WEAKNESS IN LITTLE BELLA'S THROAT BOTH SEA AIR AND BATHING
6696-73296-0004 AND AS TO MYSELF I HAVE BEEN LONG PERFECTLY CONVINCED THOUGH PERHAPS I NEVER TOLD YOU SO BEFORE THAT THE SEA IS VERY RARELY OF USE TO ANYBODY I AM SURE IT ALMOST KILLED ME ONCE COME COME CRIED EMMA FEELING THIS TO BE AN UNSAFE SUBJECT
6696-73296-0005 IT MAKES ME ENVIOUS AND MISERABLE I WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN IT SOUTH END IS PROHIBITED IF YOU PLEASE MY DEAR ISABELLA I HAVE NOT HEARD YOU MAKE ONE INQUIRY AFTER MISTER PERRY YET AND HE NEVER FORGETS YOU OH GOOD MISTER PERRY HOW IS HE SIR
6696-73296-0006 I SUPPOSE THERE IS NOT A MAN IN SUCH PRACTICE ANYWHERE BUT THEN THERE IS NOT SO CLEVER A MAN ANYWHERE AND MISSUS PERRY AND THE CHILDREN HOW ARE THEY DO THE CHILDREN GROW I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR MISTER PERRY I HOPE HE WILL BE CALLING SOON
6696-73296-0007 HE WILL BE SO PLEASED TO SEE MY LITTLE ONES I HOPE HE WILL BE HERE TO MORROW FOR I HAVE A QUESTION OR TWO TO ASK HIM ABOUT MYSELF OF SOME CONSEQUENCE AND MY DEAR WHENEVER HE COMES YOU HAD BETTER LET HIM LOOK AT LITTLE BELLA'S THROAT OH MY DEAR SIR
6696-73296-0008 HER THROAT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAT I HAVE HARDLY ANY UNEASINESS ABOUT IT EITHER BATHING HAS BEEN OF THE GREATEST SERVICE TO HER OR ELSE IT IS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO AN EXCELLENT EMBROCATION OF MISTER WINGFIELD'S
6696-73296-0009 I HAVE NOT HEARD ONE INQUIRY AFTER THEM
6696-73296-0010 HOW ARE THEY SIR WHY PRETTY WELL MY DEAR UPON THE WHOLE BUT POOR MISSUS BATES HAD A BAD COLD ABOUT A MONTH AGO HOW SORRY I AM BUT COLDS WERE NEVER SO PREVALENT AS THEY HAVE BEEN THIS AUTUMN
6696-73296-0011 MISTER WINGFIELD TOLD ME THAT HE HAD NEVER KNOWN THEM MORE GENERAL OR HEAVY EXCEPT WHEN IT HAS BEEN QUITE AN INFLUENZA THAT HAS BEEN A GOOD DEAL THE CASE MY DEAR BUT NOT TO THE DEGREE YOU MENTION PERRY SAYS THAT COLDS HAVE BEEN VERY GENERAL
6696-73296-0012 BUT NOT SO HEAVY AS HE HAS VERY OFTEN KNOWN THEM IN NOVEMBER PERRY DOES NOT CALL IT ALTOGETHER A SICKLY SEASON NO I DO NOT KNOW THAT MISTER WINGFIELD CONSIDERS IT VERY SICKLY EXCEPT AH MY POOR DEAR CHILD
6696-73296-0013 THE TRUTH IS THAT IN LONDON IT IS ALWAYS A SICKLY SEASON NOBODY IS HEALTHY IN LONDON NOBODY CAN BE IT IS A DREADFUL THING TO HAVE YOU FORCED TO LIVE THERE SO FAR OFF AND THE AIR SO BAD NO INDEED WE ARE NOT AT ALL IN A BAD AIR
6696-73296-0014 OUR PART OF LONDON IS SO VERY SUPERIOR TO MOST OTHERS YOU MUST NOT CONFOUND US WITH LONDON IN GENERAL MY DEAR SIR THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BRUNSWICK SQUARE IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM ALMOST ALL THE REST WE ARE SO VERY AIRY
6696-73296-0015 I SHOULD BE UNWILLING I OWN TO LIVE IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE TOWN THERE IS HARDLY ANY OTHER THAT I COULD BE SATISFIED TO HAVE MY CHILDREN IN BUT WE ARE SO REMARKABLY AIRY
6696-73296-0016 MISTER WINGFIELD THINKS THE VICINITY OF BRUNSWICK SQUARE DECIDEDLY THE MOST FAVORABLE AS TO AIR AH MY DEAR IT IS NOT LIKE HARTFIELD YOU MAKE THE BEST OF IT BUT AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN A WEEK AT HARTFIELD YOU ARE ALL OF YOU DIFFERENT CREATURES
6696-73296-0017 NOW I CANNOT SAY THAT I THINK YOU ARE ANY OF YOU LOOKING WELL AT PRESENT I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU SAY SO SIR BUT I ASSURE YOU EXCEPTING THOSE LITTLE NERVOUS HEADACHES AND PALPITATIONS WHICH I AM NEVER ENTIRELY FREE FROM ANYWHERE I AM QUITE WELL MYSELF
6696-73296-0018 AND IF THE CHILDREN WERE RATHER PALE BEFORE THEY WENT TO BED IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE THEY WERE A LITTLE MORE TIRED THAN USUAL FROM THEIR JOURNEY AND THE HAPPINESS OF COMING I HOPE YOU WILL THINK BETTER OF THEIR LOOKS TO MORROW
6696-73296-0019 FOR I ASSURE YOU MISTER WINGFIELD TOLD ME THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE HE HAD EVER SENT US OFF ALTOGETHER IN SUCH GOOD CASE
6696-73296-0020 TURNING HER EYES WITH AFFECTIONATE ANXIETY TOWARD HER HUSBAND MIDDLING MY DEAR I CANNOT COMPLIMENT YOU I THINK MISTER JOHN KNIGHTLEY VERY FAR FROM LOOKING WELL WHAT IS THE MATTER SIR DID YOU SPEAK TO ME CRIED MISTER JOHN KNIGHTLEY HEARING HIS OWN NAME
6696-73296-0021 I AM SORRY TO FIND MY LOVE THAT MY FATHER DOES NOT THINK YOU LOOKING WELL BUT I HOPE IT IS ONLY FROM BEING A LITTLE FATIGUED I COULD HAVE WISHED HOWEVER AS YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAD SEEN MISTER WINGFIELD BEFORE YOU LEFT HOME
6696-73296-0022 SHE HAD NOTHING WORSE TO HEAR THAN ISABELLA'S KIND INQUIRY AFTER JANE FAIRFAX AND JANE FAIRFAX THOUGH NO GREAT FAVORITE WITH HER IN GENERAL SHE WAS AT THAT MOMENT VERY HAPPY TO ASSIST IN PRAISING
6696-73296-0023 THAT SWEET AMIABLE JANE FAIRFAX SAID MISSUS JOHN KNIGHTLEY IT IS SO LONG SINCE I HAVE SEEN HER EXCEPT NOW AND THEN FOR A MOMENT ACCIDENTALLY IN TOWN WHAT HAPPINESS IT MUST BE TO HER GOOD OLD GRANDMOTHER AND EXCELLENT AUNT WHEN SHE COMES TO VISIT THEM
6696-73296-0024 I ALWAYS REGRET EXCESSIVELY ON DEAR EMMA'S ACCOUNT THAT SHE CANNOT BE MORE AT HIGHBURY BUT NOW THEIR DAUGHTER IS MARRIED I SUPPOSE COLONEL AND MISSUS CAMPBELL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PART WITH HER AT ALL SHE WOULD BE SUCH A DELIGHTFUL COMPANION FOR EMMA
6696-73296-0025 MISTER WOODHOUSE AGREED TO IT ALL BUT ADDED OUR LITTLE FRIEND HARRIET SMITH HOWEVER IS JUST SUCH ANOTHER PRETTY KIND OF YOUNG PERSON YOU WILL LIKE HARRIET EMMA COULD NOT HAVE A BETTER COMPANION THAN HARRIET
6696-73296-0026 BUT ONLY JANE FAIRFAX ONE KNOWS TO BE SO VERY ACCOMPLISHED AND SUPERIOR AND EXACTLY EMMA'S AGE THIS TOPIC WAS DISCUSSED VERY HAPPILY AND OTHERS SUCCEEDED OF SIMILAR MOMENT AND PASSED AWAY WITH SIMILAR HARMONY
6696-73296-0027 BUT THE EVENING DID NOT CLOSE WITHOUT A LITTLE RETURN OF AGITATION THE GRUEL CAME AND SUPPLIED A GREAT DEAL TO BE SAID MUCH PRAISE AND MANY COMMENTS UNDOUBTING DECISION OF ITS WHOLESOMENESS FOR EVERY CONSTITUTION
6696-73296-0028 BUT UNFORTUNATELY AMONG THE FAILURES WHICH THE DAUGHTER HAD TO INSTANCE
6696-73296-0029 AH SAID MISTER WOODHOUSE SHAKING HIS HEAD AND FIXING HIS EYES ON HER WITH TENDER CONCERN THE EJACULATION IN EMMA'S EAR EXPRESSED
6696-73296-0030 IT DOES NOT BEAR TALKING OF AND FOR A LITTLE WHILE SHE HOPED HE WOULD NOT TALK OF IT AND THAT A SILENT RUMINATION MIGHT SUFFICE TO RESTORE HIM TO THE RELISH OF HIS OWN SMOOTH GRUEL AFTER AN INTERVAL OF SOME MINUTES HOWEVER HE BEGAN WITH
6696-73296-0031 I SHALL ALWAYS BE VERY SORRY THAT YOU WENT TO THE SEA THIS AUTUMN INSTEAD OF COMING HERE BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BE SORRY SIR I ASSURE YOU IT DID THE CHILDREN A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD AND MOREOVER IF YOU MUST GO TO THE SEA IT HAD BETTER NOT HAVE BEEN TO SOUTH END
6696-73296-0032 SOUTH END IS AN UNHEALTHY PLACE PERRY WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR YOU HAD FIXED UPON SOUTH END I KNOW THERE IS SUCH AN IDEA WITH MANY PEOPLE BUT INDEED IT IS QUITE A MISTAKE SIR WE ALL HAD OUR HEALTH PERFECTLY WELL THERE NEVER FOUND THE LEAST INCONVENIENCE FROM THE MUD
6696-73296-0033 AND MISTER WINGFIELD SAYS IT IS ENTIRELY A MISTAKE TO SUPPOSE THE PLACE UNHEALTHY AND I AM SURE HE MAY BE DEPENDED ON FOR HE THOROUGHLY UNDERSTANDS THE NATURE OF THE AIR AND HIS OWN BROTHER AND FAMILY HAVE BEEN THERE REPEATEDLY YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE TO CROMER MY DEAR IF YOU WENT ANYWHERE
6696-73296-0034 PERRY WAS A WEEK AT CROMER ONCE AND HE HOLDS IT TO BE THE BEST OF ALL THE SEA BATHING PLACES
6696-73296-0035 AND BY WHAT I UNDERSTAND YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD LODGINGS THERE QUITE AWAY FROM THE SEA A QUARTER OF A MILE OFF VERY COMFORTABLE YOU SHOULD HAVE CONSULTED PERRY BUT MY DEAR SIR
6696-73296-0036 AND IF ONE IS TO TRAVEL THERE IS NOT MUCH TO CHOOSE BETWEEN FORTY MILES AND A HUNDRED BETTER NOT MOVE AT ALL BETTER STAY IN LONDON ALTOGETHER THAN TRAVEL FORTY MILES TO GET INTO A WORSE AIR THIS IS JUST WHAT PERRY SAID IT SEEMED TO HIM A VERY ILL JUDGED MEASURE
6696-73296-0037 EMMA'S ATTEMPTS TO STOP HER FATHER HAD BEEN VAIN AND WHEN HE HAD REACHED SUCH A POINT AS THIS SHE COULD NOT WONDER AT HER BROTHER IN LAW'S BREAKING OUT MISTER PERRY SAID HE IN A VOICE OF VERY STRONG DISPLEASURE WOULD DO AS WELL TO KEEP HIS OPINION TILL IT IS ASKED FOR
6696-73296-0038 WHY DOES HE MAKE IT ANY BUSINESS OF HIS TO WONDER AT WHAT I DO AT MY TAKING MY FAMILY TO ONE PART OF THE COAST OR ANOTHER I MAY BE ALLOWED I HOPE THE USE OF MY JUDGMENT AS WELL AS MISTER PERRY I WANT HIS DIRECTIONS NO MORE THAN HIS DRUGS HE PAUSED
6696-73296-0039 AND GROWING COOLER IN A MOMENT ADDED WITH ONLY SARCASTIC DRYNESS IF MISTER PERRY CAN TELL ME HOW TO CONVEY A WIFE AND FIVE CHILDREN A DISTANCE OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILES WITH NO GREATER EXPENSE OR INCONVENIENCE THAN A DISTANCE OF FORTY
6696-73296-0040 I SHOULD BE AS WILLING TO PREFER CROMER TO SOUTH END AS HE COULD HIMSELF TRUE TRUE CRIED MISTER KNIGHTLEY WITH MOST READY INTERPOSITION VERY TRUE THAT'S A CONSIDERATION INDEED BUT JOHN
