2696-157636-0036 WHO COULD NOT FOLLOW HIS CALLING WITHOUT HIS PIPE IN HIS MOUTH BUT THAT TEXT ISAIAH FIFTY FIVE TWO COMING INTO HIS MIND HEE LAYD ASIDE HIS TAKING OF TOBACCO THE OTHER INSTANCE WAS OF A PROFANE PERSON LIVING NIGH HASLINGDON WHO WAS BUT POOR

2696-157636-0041 NONE OF THOSE WHO KEPT TOBACCONISTS SHOPS SUFFERED FROM IT AND THIS BELIEF NO DOUBT ENHANCED THE MEDICAL REPUTATION OF THE WEED I HAVE ALSO SEEN IT STATED THAT DURING THE CHOLERA EPIDEMICS OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE AND EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX NOT ONE LONDON TOBACCONIST DIED FROM THAT DISEASE
2696-157636-0042 BUT GOOD AUTHORITY FOR THE STATEMENT SEEMS TO BE LACKING HUTTON IN HIS HISTORY OF DERBY SAYS THAT WHEN THAT TOWN WAS VISITED BY THE PLAGUE IN SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE THAT AT THE HEADLESS CROSS THE MARKET PEOPLE HAVING THEIR MOUTHS PRIMED WITH TOBACCO AS A PRESERVATIVE
2696-157636-0043 BROUGHT THEIR PROVISIONS IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THIS CRUEL AFFLICTION NEVER ATTEMPTED THE PREMISES OF A TOBACCONIST A TANNER OR A SHOEMAKER WHATEVER GROUND THERE MAY HAVE BEEN FOR THE BELIEF IN THE PROPHYLACTIC EFFECT OF SMOKING
2696-157636-0044 HOWELL IN ONE OF HIS FAMILIAR LETTERS DATED JANUARY FIRST SIXTEEN FORTY SIX SAYS THAT THE SMOKE OF TOBACCO IS ONE OF THE WHOLESOMEST SENTS THAT IS AGAINST ALL CONTAGIOUS AIRS FOR IT OVERMASTERS ALL OTHER SMELLS
2696-157636-0045 IT HATH SINGULAR AND CONTRARY EFFECTS IT IS GOOD TO WARM ONE BEING COLD AND WILL COOL ONE BEING HOT ALL AGES ALL SEXES ALL CONSTITUTIONS YOUNG AND OLD MEN AND WOMEN THE SANGUINE THE CHOLERICK THE MELANCHOLY THE PHLEGMATICK

2696-157636-0047 IT HATH AN OFFENSIVE SMELL TO SOME AND IS MORE DESIRABLE THAN ANY PERFUME TO OTHERS THAT IT IS A MOST EXCELLENT PRESERVATIVE BOTH EXPERIENCE AND REASON DO TEACH IT CORRECTS THE AIR BY FUMIGATION AND IT AVOIDS CORRUPT HUMOURS BY SALIVATION
2696-157636-0048 FOR WHEN ONE TAKES IT EITHER BY CHEWING IT IN THE LEAF OR SMOAKING IT IN THE PIPE
2696-157636-0049 AND FROM THENCE RISING UP TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOBACCONIST AS TO THE HELME OF A SUBLIMATORY ARE VOIDED AND SPITTEN OUT WHEN PLAGUE WAS ABROAD EVEN CHILDREN WERE COMPELLED TO SMOKE
2696-157636-0050 AT THE TIME OF THE DREADFUL VISITATION OF SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE ALL THE BOYS AT ETON WERE OBLIGED TO SMOKE IN SCHOOL EVERY MORNING ONE OF THESE JUVENILE SMOKERS A CERTAIN TOM ROGERS
2696-157636-0051 YEARS AFTERWARDS DECLARED TO HEARNE THE OXFORD ANTIQUARY THAT HE NEVER WAS WHIPPED SO MUCH IN HIS LIFE AS HE WAS ONE MORNING FOR NOT SMOKING TIMES HAVE CHANGED AT ETON SINCE THIS ANTI TOBACCONIST MARTYR RECEIVED HIS WHIPPING
2696-157636-0052 AND THAT AT A STATED HOUR EACH MORNING LESSONS WERE LAID ASIDE AND MASTERS AND SCHOLARS ALIKE PRODUCED THEIR PIPES AND PROCEEDED TO SMOKE TOBACCO BUT I KNOW OF NO AUTHORITY FOR THIS WIDER STATEMENT IT SEEMS TO HAVE GROWN OUT OF HEARNE'S RECORD OF THE PRACTICE AT ETON
2696-157636-0053 AND THE WORDS LORD HAVE MERCY UPON US CHALKED UPON THE DOORS HE FELT SO ILL AT EASE
2696-157636-0054 WHICH CONSIDERING HIS PROFICIENCY IN THE ARTS OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP IS PERHAPS A LITTLE SURPRISING
2696-157636-0055 NEVER HAD THE DISTEMPER AT ALL BUT LIVED ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AFTER IT AND WAS SEXTON OF THE PARISH TO THE TIME OF HIS DEATH
2696-157636-0056 NEVER USED ANY PRESERVATIVE AGAINST THE INFECTION
2696-157636-0057 WHEN EXCAVATIONS WERE IN PROGRESS EARLY IN NINETEEN O ONE PREPARATORY TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF KINGSWAY AND ALDWYCH THEY INCLUDED THE REMOVAL OF BODIES FROM THE BURYING GROUNDS OF SAINT CLEMENT DANES
2696-157636-0058 BY THOSE WHOSE OFFICE IT WAS TO BURY THE DEAD THESE PIPES HAVE BEEN DUG UP FROM TIME TO TIME IN NUMBERS SO LARGE THAT ONE ANTIQUARY MISTER H SYER CUMING HAS VENTURED TO INFER THAT ALMOST EVERY PERSON WHO VENTURED FROM HOME INVOKED THE PROTECTION OF TOBACCO
2696-157636-0059 THESE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY PIPES WERE LARGELY MADE IN HOLLAND OF PIPE CLAY IMPORTED FROM ENGLAND TO THE DISGUST AND LOSS OF ENGLISH PIPE MAKERS IN SIXTEEN SIXTY THREE THE COMPANY OF TOBACCO PIPE MAKERS
2696-157636-0060 PETITIONED PARLIAMENT TO FORBID THE EXPORT OF TOBACCO PIPE CLAY SINCE BY THE MANUFACTURE OF PIPES IN HOLLAND THEIR TRADE IS MUCH DAMAGED FURTHER THEY ASKED FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF THEIR CHARTER OF GOVERNMENT SO AS TO EMPOWER THEM TO REGULATE ABUSES
2696-157636-0061 AS MANY PERSONS ENGAGE IN THE TRADE WITHOUT LICENCE THE COMPANY'S REQUEST WAS GRANTED
2696-157636-0062 AND THEIR THREATENED RUIN BECAUSE COOKS BAKERS AND ALE HOUSE KEEPERS AND OTHERS MAKE PIPES BUT SO UNSKILFULLY THAT THEY ARE BROUGHT INTO DISESTEEM THEY REQUEST TO BE COMPREHENDED IN THE STATUTE OF LABOURERS OF FIVE ELIZABETH
2696-157636-0063 SO THAT NONE MAY FOLLOW THE TRADE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN APPRENTICES SEVEN YEARS TOBACCO PIPE MAKING WAS A FLOURISHING INDUSTRY AT THIS PERIOD AND THROUGHOUT THE SEVENTEENTH AND FOLLOWING CENTURY IN MOST OF THE CHIEF PROVINCIAL TOWNS AND CITIES
2696-157636-0064 AS WELL AS IN LONDON OLD ENGLISH CLAYS SAYS MISTER T P COOPER ARE EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTING AS MOST OF THEM ARE BRANDED WITH THE MAKER'S INITIALS MONOGRAMS AND DESIGNS WERE STAMPED OR MOULDED UPON THE BOWLS AND ON THE STEMS
2696-157636-0065 BUT MORE GENERALLY UPON THE SPUR OR FLAT HEEL OF THE PIPE MANY PIPES DISPLAY ON THE HEELS VARIOUS FORMS OF LINES HATCHED AND MILLED WHICH WERE PERHAPS THE EARLIEST MARKS OF IDENTIFICATION ADOPTED BY THE PIPE MAKERS
2696-157636-0066 IN A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE MONOGRAMS WE ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE MAKERS OF CERTAIN PIPES FOUND IN QUANTITIES AT VARIOUS PLACES BY REFERENCE TO THE FREEMAN AND BURGESS ROLLS AND PARISH REGISTERS DURING THE LATTER HALF OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ENGLISH PIPES
2696-157636-0067 WERE PRESENTED BY COLONISTS IN AMERICA TO THE INDIANS THEY SUBSEQUENTLY BECAME VALUABLE AS OBJECTS OF BARTER OR PART PURCHASE VALUE IN EXCHANGE FOR LAND IN SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY PIPES AND ONE HUNDRED JEW'S HARPS WERE GIVEN FOR A STRIP OF COUNTRY NEAR TIMBER CREEK
2696-157636-0068 IN NEW JERSEY WILLIAM PENN THE FOUNDER OF PENNSYLVANIA PURCHASED A TRACT OF LAND AND THREE HUNDRED PIPES WERE INCLUDED IN THE ARTICLES GIVEN IN THE EXCHANGE THE FRENCH TRAVELLER SORBIERE WHO VISITED LONDON IN SIXTEEN SIXTY THREE
2696-157636-0069 DECLARED THAT THE ENGLISH WERE NATURALLY LAZY AND SPENT HALF THEIR TIME IN TAKING TOBACCO THEY SMOKED AFTER MEALS HE OBSERVED AND CONVERSED FOR A LONG TIME THERE IS SCARCE A DAY PASSES HE WROTE BUT A TRADESMAN GOES TO THE ALE HOUSE OR TAVERN TO SMOKE WITH SOME OF HIS FRIENDS
2696-157636-0070 AND THEREFORE PUBLIC HOUSES ARE NUMEROUS HERE AND BUSINESS GOES ON BUT SLOWLY IN THE SHOPS BUT CURIOUSLY ENOUGH HE MAKES NO MENTION OF COFFEE HOUSES A LITTLE LATER THEY WERE TOO COMMON AND TOO MUCH FREQUENTED TO BE OVERLOOKED
2696-157636-0071 AN ENGLISH WRITER ON THRIFT IN SIXTEEN SEVENTY SIX SAID THAT IT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR A MECHANIC TRADESMAN TO GO TO THE COFFEE HOUSE OR ALE HOUSE IN THE MORNING TO DRINK HIS MORNING'S DRAUGHT AND THERE HE WOULD SPEND TWOPENCE
2696-157636-0072 AND CONSUME AN HOUR IN SMOKING AND TALKING SPENDING SEVERAL HOURS OF THE EVENING IN SIMILAR FASHION COUNTRY GENTLEMEN SMOKED JUST AS MUCH AS TOWN MECHANICS AND TRADESMEN IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT HERVEY AFTERWARDS EARL OF BRISTOL
2696-157636-0073 WROTE TO MISTER THOMAS CULLUM OF HAWSTED PLACE

2696-157636-0076 AS LONG AS IT STOOD I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW ON WHAT AUTHORITY SIR JOHN CULLUM COULD HAVE MADE THE ASSERTION THAT THE ROOM WAS CALLED THE SMOKING ROOM FROM SO EARLY A DATE AS THE END OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY NO MENTION IN PRINT OF A SMOKING ROOM HAS BEEN FOUND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE OXFORD DICTIONARY
2696-157636-0077 WHO LOVES TO TELL OF HIS EARLY MEETINGS WITH BEN JONSON AND OTHER LITERARY HEROES OF A BYGONE DAY WHILE ALL THE BEAU MONDE AS MY DAUGHTER SAYS ARE WITH US IN THE DRAWING ROOM YOU HAVE NONE BUT ILL BRED WITLESS DRUNKARDS WITH YOU IN YOUR SMOKING ROOM
2696-157636-0078 AS MISTER OLDWIT HIMSELF IN ANOTHER SCENE OF THE SAME PLAY SAYS TO HIS FRIENDS WE'LL INTO MY SMOKING ROOM AND SPORT ABOUT A BRIMMER THERE WAS PROBABLY SOME EXCUSE FOR HIS WIFE'S REMARK
2696-157636-0079 THESE COUNTRY SMOKING ROOMS WERE KNOWN IN LATER DAYS AS STONE PARLOURS THE FLOOR BEING FLAGGED FOR SAFETY'S SAKE AND THE STONE PARLOUR IN MANY A SQUIRE'S HOUSE WAS THE SCENE OF MUCH CONVIVIALITY INCLUDING NO DOUBT ABUNDANT SMOKING
2696-157636-0080 OPENED A NEW FIELD FOR THE VICTORIES OF TOBACCO THE FIRST HOUSE WAS OPENED IN SAINT MICHAEL'S ALLEY CORNHILL IN SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO OTHERS SOON FOLLOWED AND IN A SHORT TIME THE NEW BEVERAGE HAD CAPTURED THE TOWN AND COFFEE HOUSES HAD BEEN OPENED IN EVERY DIRECTION
2696-157636-0081 THEY SOLD MANY THINGS BESIDES COFFEE AND SERVED A VARIETY OF PURPOSES BUT PRIMARILY THEY WERE TEMPLES OF TALK AND GOOD FELLOWSHIP
