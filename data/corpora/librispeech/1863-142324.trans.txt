1863-142324-0000 HERE WE GO UP UP UP AND HERE WE GO DOWN DOWN DOWNEE NURSERY SONG MEANWHILE AT MILTON THE CHIMNEYS SMOKED THE CEASELESS ROAR AND MIGHTY BEAT AND DIZZYING WHIRL OF MACHINERY
1863-142324-0001 STRUGGLED AND STROVE PERPETUALLY SENSELESS AND PURPOSELESS WERE WOOD AND IRON AND STEAM IN THEIR ENDLESS LABOURS BUT THE PERSISTENCE OF THEIR MONOTONOUS WORK
1863-142324-0002 WERE BUSY AND RESTLESS IN SEEKING AFTER WHAT IN THE STREETS THERE WERE FEW LOITERERS NONE WALKING FOR MERE PLEASURE EVERY MAN'S FACE WAS SET IN LINES OF EAGERNESS OR ANXIETY NEWS WAS SOUGHT FOR WITH FIERCE AVIDITY
1863-142324-0003 AND MEN JOSTLED EACH OTHER ASIDE IN THE MART AND IN THE EXCHANGE AS THEY DID IN LIFE IN THE DEEP SELFISHNESS OF COMPETITION THERE WAS GLOOM OVER THE TOWN FEW CAME TO BUY AND THOSE WHO DID WERE LOOKED AT SUSPICIOUSLY BY THE SELLERS
1863-142324-0004 FOR CREDIT WAS INSECURE AND THE MOST STABLE MIGHT HAVE THEIR FORTUNES AFFECTED BY THE SWEEP IN THE GREAT NEIGHBOURING PORT AMONG THE SHIPPING HOUSES HITHERTO THERE HAD BEEN NO FAILURES IN MILTON BUT FROM THE IMMENSE SPECULATIONS
1863-142324-0005 THAT HAD COME TO LIGHT IN MAKING A BAD END IN AMERICA AND YET NEARER HOME IT WAS KNOWN THAT SOME MILTON HOUSES OF BUSINESS MUST SUFFER SO SEVERELY THAT EVERY DAY MEN'S FACES ASKED IF THEIR TONGUES DID NOT WHAT NEWS WHO IS GONE
1863-142324-0006 HOW WILL IT AFFECT ME AND IF TWO OR THREE SPOKE TOGETHER
1863-142324-0007 THAN DARED TO HINT AT THOSE LIKELY IN THEIR OPINION TO GO FOR IDLE BREATH MAY AT SUCH TIMES CAUSE THE DOWNFALL OF SOME WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE WEATHER THE STORM AND ONE GOING DOWN DRAGS MANY AFTER THORNTON IS SAFE SAY THEY
1863-142324-0008 HIS BUSINESS IS LARGE EXTENDING EVERY YEAR BUT SUCH A HEAD AS HE HAS AND SO PRUDENT WITH ALL HIS DARING THEN ONE MAN DRAWS ANOTHER ASIDE AND WALKS A LITTLE APART
1863-142324-0009 AND WITH HEAD INCLINED INTO HIS NEIGHBOUR'S EAR HE SAYS THORNTON'S BUSINESS IS LARGE BUT HE HAS SPENT HIS PROFITS IN EXTENDING IT HE HAS NO CAPITAL LAID BY HIS MACHINERY IS NEW WITHIN THESE TWO YEARS
1863-142324-0010 AND HAS COST HIM WE WON'T SAY WHAT A WORD TO THE WISE BUT THAT MISTER HARRISON WAS A CROAKER A MAN WHO HAD SUCCEEDED TO HIS FATHER'S TRADE MADE FORTUNE WHICH HE HAD FEARED TO LOSE BY ALTERING HIS MODE OF BUSINESS
1863-142324-0011 TO ANY HAVING A LARGER SCOPE YET HE GRUDGED EVERY PENNY MADE BY OTHERS MORE DARING AND FAR SIGHTED BUT THE TRUTH WAS MISTER THORNTON WAS HARD PRESSED
1863-142324-0012 HE FELT IT ACUTELY IN HIS VULNERABLE POINT HIS PRIDE IN THE COMMERCIAL CHARACTER WHICH HE HAD ESTABLISHED FOR HIMSELF ARCHITECT OF HIS OWN FORTUNES HE ATTRIBUTED THIS TO NO SPECIAL MERIT OR QUALITIES OF HIS OWN
1863-142324-0013 BUT TO THE POWER WHICH HE BELIEVED THAT COMMERCE GAVE TO EVERY BRAVE HONEST AND PERSEVERING MAN TO RAISE HIMSELF TO A LEVEL FROM WHICH HE MIGHT SEE AND READ THE GREAT GAME OF WORLDLY SUCCESS AND HONESTLY
1863-142324-0014 FAR AWAY IN THE EAST AND IN THE WEST WHERE HIS PERSON WOULD NEVER BE KNOWN HIS NAME WAS TO BE REGARDED AND HIS WISHES TO BE FULFILLED AND HIS WORD PASS LIKE GOLD THAT WAS THE IDEA OF MERCHANT LIFE
1863-142324-0015 WITH WHICH MISTER THORNTON HAD STARTED HER MERCHANTS BE LIKE PRINCES SAID HIS MOTHER READING THE TEXT ALOUD AS IF IT WERE A TRUMPET CALL TO INVITE HER BOY TO THE STRUGGLE HE WAS BUT LIKE MANY OTHERS
1863-142324-0016 MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN ALIVE TO DISTANT AND DEAD TO NEAR THINGS HE SOUGHT TO POSSESS THE INFLUENCE OF A NAME IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND FAR AWAY SEAS TO BECOME THE HEAD OF A FIRM THAT SHOULD BE KNOWN FOR GENERATIONS
1863-142324-0017 AND IT HAD TAKEN HIM LONG SILENT YEARS TO COME EVEN TO A GLIMMERING OF WHAT HE MIGHT BE NOW TO DAY HERE IN HIS OWN TOWN HIS OWN FACTORY AMONG HIS OWN PEOPLE HE AND THEY HAD LED PARALLEL LIVES
1863-142324-0018 VERY CLOSE BUT NEVER TOUCHING TILL THE ACCIDENT OR SO IT SEEMED OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIGGINS ONCE BROUGHT FACE TO FACE MAN TO MAN WITH AN INDIVIDUAL OF THE MASSES AROUND HIM AND TAKE NOTICE
1863-142324-0019 OUT OF THE CHARACTER OF MASTER AND WORKMAN IN THE FIRST INSTANCE
1863-142324-0020 THAT WE HAVE ALL OF US ONE HUMAN HEART IT WAS THE FINE POINT OF THE WEDGE AND UNTIL NOW WHEN THE APPREHENSION OF LOSING HIS CONNECTION WITH TWO OR THREE OF THE WORKMEN WHOM HE HAD SO LATELY BEGUN TO KNOW AS MEN
1863-142324-0021 OF HAVING A PLAN OR TWO WHICH WERE EXPERIMENTS LYING VERY CLOSE TO HIS HEART ROUGHLY NIPPED OFF WITHOUT TRIAL GAVE A NEW POIGNANCY TO THE SUBTLE FEAR THAT CAME OVER HIM FROM TIME TO TIME UNTIL NOW HE HAD NEVER RECOGNISED HOW MUCH
1863-142324-0022 AND HOW DEEP WAS THE INTEREST HE HAD GROWN OF LATE TO FEEL IN HIS POSITION AS MANUFACTURER SIMPLY BECAUSE IT LED HIM INTO SUCH CLOSE CONTACT AND GAVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY OF SO MUCH POWER
1863-142324-0023 SHREWD IGNORANT BUT ABOVE ALL FULL OF CHARACTER AND STRONG HUMAN FEELING HE REVIEWED HIS POSITION AS A MILTON MANUFACTURER THE STRIKE A YEAR AND A HALF AGO OR MORE
1863-142324-0024 FOR IT WAS NOW UNTIMELY WINTRY WEATHER IN A LATE SPRING THAT STRIKE WHEN HE WAS YOUNG AND HE NOW WAS OLD HAD PREVENTED HIS COMPLETING SOME OF THE LARGE ORDERS HE HAD THEN ON HAND
1863-142324-0025 HE HAD LOCKED UP A GOOD DEAL OF HIS CAPITAL IN NEW AND EXPENSIVE MACHINERY AND HE HAD ALSO BOUGHT COTTON LARGELY FOR THE FULFILMENT OF THESE ORDERS TAKEN UNDER CONTRACT
1863-142324-0026 THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO COMPLETE THEM WAS OWING IN SOME DEGREE TO THE UTTER WANT OF SKILL ON THE PART OF THE IRISH HANDS WHOM HE HAD IMPORTED MUCH OF THEIR WORK WAS DAMAGED AND UNFIT TO BE SENT FORTH BY A HOUSE WHICH PRIDED ITSELF ON TURNING OUT NOTHING
1863-142324-0027 BUT FIRST RATE ARTICLES FOR MANY MONTHS THE EMBARRASSMENT CAUSED BY THE STRIKE HAD BEEN AN OBSTACLE IN MISTER THORNTON'S WAY AND OFTEN WHEN HIS EYE FELL ON HIGGINS HE COULD HAVE SPOKEN ANGRILY TO HIM WITHOUT ANY PRESENT CAUSE
1863-142324-0028 JUST FROM FEELING HOW SERIOUS WAS THE INJURY THAT HAD ARISEN FROM THIS AFFAIR IN WHICH HE WAS IMPLICATED BUT WHEN HE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THIS SUDDEN QUICK RESENTMENT HE RESOLVED TO CURB IT
1863-142324-0029 IT WOULD NOT SATISFY HIM TO AVOID HIGGINS HE MUST CONVINCE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS MASTER OVER HIS OWN ANGER BY BEING PARTICULARLY CAREFUL TO ALLOW HIGGINS ACCESS TO HIM
1863-142324-0030 WHENEVER THE STRICT RULES OF BUSINESS OR MISTER THORNTON'S LEISURE PERMITTED AND BY AND BYE HE LOST ALL SENSE OF RESENTMENT IN WONDER HOW IT WAS OR COULD BE THAT TWO MEN LIKE HIMSELF AND HIGGINS
1863-142324-0031 LIVING BY THE SAME TRADE WORKING IN THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS AT THE SAME OBJECT COULD LOOK UPON EACH OTHER'S POSITION AND DUTIES IN SO STRANGELY DIFFERENT A WAY AND THENCE AROSE THAT INTERCOURSE
1863-142324-0032 WHICH THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT HAVE THE EFFECT OF PREVENTING ALL FUTURE CLASH OF OPINION AND ACTION WHEN THE OCCASION AROSE WOULD AT ANY RATE ENABLE BOTH MASTER AND MAN TO LOOK UPON EACH OTHER WITH FAR MORE CHARITY AND SYMPATHY
1863-142324-0033 AND BEAR WITH EACH OTHER MORE PATIENTLY AND KINDLY BESIDES THIS IMPROVEMENT OF FEELING BOTH MISTER THORNTON AND HIS WORKMEN FOUND OUT THEIR IGNORANCE AS TO POSITIVE MATTERS OF FACT
1863-142324-0034 TO ONE SIDE BUT NOT TO THE OTHER BUT NOW HAD COME ONE OF THOSE PERIODS OF BAD TRADE WHEN THE MARKET FALLING BROUGHT DOWN THE VALUE OF ALL LARGE STOCKS MISTER THORNTON'S FELL TO NEARLY HALF
1863-142324-0035 NO ORDERS WERE COMING IN SO HE LOST THE INTEREST OF THE CAPITAL HE HAD LOCKED UP IN MACHINERY INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET PAYMENT FOR THE ORDERS COMPLETED YET THERE WAS THE CONSTANT DRAIN OF EXPENSES FOR WORKING THE BUSINESS
1863-142324-0036 THEN THE BILLS BECAME DUE FOR THE COTTON HE HAD PURCHASED AND MONEY BEING SCARCE HE COULD ONLY BORROW AT EXORBITANT INTEREST AND YET HE COULD NOT REALISE ANY OF HIS PROPERTY BUT HE DID NOT DESPAIR
1863-142324-0037 HE EXERTED HIMSELF DAY AND NIGHT TO FORESEE AND TO PROVIDE FOR ALL EMERGENCIES HE WAS AS CALM AND GENTLE TO THE WOMEN IN HIS HOME AS EVER TO THE WORKMEN IN HIS MILL HE SPOKE NOT MANY WORDS BUT THEY KNEW HIM BY THIS TIME
1863-142324-0038 AND MANY A CURT DECIDED ANSWER WAS RECEIVED BY THEM RATHER WITH SYMPATHY FOR THE CARE THEY SAW PRESSING UPON HIM THAN WITH THE SUPPRESSED ANTAGONISM WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN SMOULDERING AND READY FOR HARD WORDS AND HARD JUDGMENTS ON ALL OCCASIONS
1863-142324-0039 SAID HIGGINS ONE DAY AS HE HEARD MISTER THORNTON'S SHORT SHARP INQUIRY WHY SUCH A COMMAND HAD NOT BEEN OBEYED AND CAUGHT THE SOUND OF THE SUPPRESSED SIGH WHICH HE HEAVED IN GOING PAST THE ROOM WHERE SOME OF THE MEN WERE WORKING
1863-142324-0040 HIGGINS AND ANOTHER MAN STOPPED OVER HOURS THAT NIGHT UNKNOWN TO ANY ONE TO GET THE NEGLECTED PIECE OF WORK DONE AND MISTER THORNTON NEVER KNEW BUT THAT THE OVERLOOKER TO WHOM HE HAD GIVEN THE COMMAND IN THE FIRST INSTANCE HAD DONE IT HIMSELF
1863-142324-0041 THOUGHT HIGGINS ONE DAY AS HE WAS APPROACHING MISTER THORNTON IN MARLBOROUGH STREET
1863-142324-0042 SAID HE STOPPING HIS EMPLOYER IN HIS QUICK RESOLVED WALK AND CAUSING THAT GENTLEMAN TO LOOK UP WITH A SUDDEN ANNOYED START AS IF HIS THOUGHTS HAD BEEN FAR AWAY
1863-142324-0043 MISS WHO REPLIED MISTER THORNTON MISS MARGET MISS HALE
1863-142324-0044 YO KNOWN WHO I MEAN WELL ENOUGH IF YO'LL ONLY THINK A BIT THERE WAS NOTHING DISRESPECTFUL IN THE TONE IN WHICH THIS WAS SAID OH YES AND SUDDENLY THE WINTRY FROST BOUND LOOK OF CARE HAD LEFT MISTER THORNTON'S FACE
1863-142324-0045 AS IF SOME SOFT SUMMER GALE HAD BLOWN ALL ANXIETY AWAY FROM HIS MIND AND THOUGH HIS MOUTH WAS AS MUCH COMPRESSED AS BEFORE HIS EYES SMILED OUT BENIGNLY ON HIS QUESTIONER SHE'S MY LANDLORD NOW YOU KNOW HIGGINS
1863-142324-0046 I HEAR OF HER THROUGH HER AGENT HERE EVERY NOW AND THEN SHE'S WELL AND AMONG FRIENDS THANK YOU HIGGINS THAT THANK YOU THAT LINGERED AFTER THE OTHER WORDS
1863-142324-0047 LET IN A NEW LIGHT TO THE ACUTE HIGGINS
1863-142324-0048 NOT YET THE FACE WAS CLOUDY ONCE MORE THERE IS SOME TALK OF IT AS I UNDERSTAND WITH A CONNECTION OF THE FAMILY THEN SHE'LL NOT BE FOR COMING TO MILTON AGAIN I RECKON NO
1863-142324-0049 THEN GOING UP CONFIDENTIALLY CLOSE HE SAID
1863-142324-0050 HE ENFORCED THE DEPTH OF HIS INTELLIGENCE BY A WINK OF THE EYE
1863-142324-0051 HER BROTHER AS WAS OVER HERE YO KNOWN OVER HERE AY TO BE SURE

1863-142324-0056 I NOBBUT WANTED TO KNOW IF THEY'D GETTEN HIM CLEARED NOT THAT I KNOW OF I KNOW NOTHING I ONLY HEAR OF MISS HALE NOW AS MY LANDLORD AND THROUGH HER LAWYER HE BROKE OFF FROM HIGGINS
1863-142324-0057 TO FOLLOW THE BUSINESS ON WHICH HE HAD BEEN BENT WHEN THE LATTER FIRST ACCOSTED HIM LEAVING HIGGINS BAFFLED IN HIS ENDEAVOUR IT WAS HER BROTHER SAID MISTER THORNTON TO HIMSELF I AM GLAD
1863-142324-0058 I MAY NEVER SEE HER AGAIN BUT IT IS A COMFORT A RELIEF TO KNOW THAT MUCH I KNEW SHE COULD NOT BE UNMAIDENLY
1863-142324-0059 NOW I AM GLAD IT WAS A LITTLE GOLDEN THREAD RUNNING THROUGH THE DARK WEB OF HIS PRESENT FORTUNES WHICH WERE GROWING EVER GLOOMIER AND MORE GLOOMY
1863-142324-0060 WHICH WENT DOWN ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHERS JUST AT THIS TIME LIKE A PACK OF CARDS THE FALL OF ONE COMPELLING OTHER FAILURES WHAT WERE MISTER THORNTON'S ENGAGEMENTS COULD HE STAND
1863-142324-0061 NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HE TOOK BOOKS AND PAPERS INTO HIS OWN PRIVATE ROOM
1863-142324-0062 HE THOUGHT THAT NO ONE KNEW OF THIS OCCUPATION OF THE HOURS HE SHOULD HAVE SPENT IN SLEEP ONE MORNING WHEN DAYLIGHT WAS STEALING IN THROUGH THE CREVICES OF HIS SHUTTERS AND HE HAD NEVER BEEN IN BED
1863-142324-0063 AND IN HOPELESS INDIFFERENCE OF MIND WAS THINKING THAT HE COULD DO WITHOUT THE HOUR OR TWO OF REST WHICH WAS ALL THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE BEFORE THE STIR OF DAILY LABOUR BEGAN AGAIN THE DOOR OF HIS ROOM OPENED AND HIS MOTHER STOOD THERE DRESSED
1863-142324-0064 AS SHE HAD BEEN THE DAY BEFORE SHE HAD NEVER LAID HERSELF DOWN TO SLUMBER ANY MORE THAN HE THEIR EYES MET THEIR FACES WERE COLD AND RIGID AND WAN FROM LONG WATCHING MOTHER
1863-142324-0065 SAID SHE DO YOU THINK I CAN SLEEP WITH AN EASY MIND WHILE YOU KEEP AWAKE FULL OF CARE YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME WHAT YOUR TROUBLE IS BUT SORE TROUBLE YOU HAVE HAD THESE MANY DAYS PAST TRADE IS BAD
1863-142324-0066 AND YOU DREAD I DREAD NOTHING REPLIED HE DRAWING UP HIS HEAD AND HOLDING IT ERECT I KNOW NOW THAT NO MAN WILL SUFFER BY ME THAT WAS MY ANXIETY
1863-142324-0067 BUT HOW DO YOU STAND SHALL YOU WILL IT BE A FAILURE
1863-142324-0068 NOT A FAILURE I MUST GIVE UP BUSINESS BUT I PAY ALL MEN I MIGHT REDEEM MYSELF I AM SORELY TEMPTED HOW OH JOHN KEEP UP YOUR NAME TRY ALL RISKS FOR THAT HOW REDEEM IT
1863-142324-0069 BY A SPECULATION OFFERED TO ME FULL OF RISK BUT IF SUCCESSFUL PLACING ME HIGH ABOVE WATER MARK SO THAT NO ONE NEED EVER KNOW THE STRAIT I AM IN STILL IF IT FAILS AND IF IT FAILS
1863-142324-0070 SAID SHE ADVANCING AND LAYING HER HAND ON HIS ARM HER EYES FULL OF EAGER LIGHT SHE HELD HER BREATH TO HEAR THE END OF HIS SPEECH
1863-142324-0071 SAID HE GLOOMILY AS I STAND NOW MY CREDITORS MONEY IS SAFE EVERY FARTHING OF IT BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND MY OWN IT MAY BE ALL GONE AND I PENNILESS AT THIS MOMENT
1863-142324-0072 THEREFORE IT IS MY CREDITORS MONEY THAT I SHOULD RISK BUT IF IT SUCCEEDED THEY NEED NEVER KNOW IS IT SO DESPERATE A SPECULATION
1863-142324-0073 I SHOULD BE A RICH MAN AND MY PEACE OF CONSCIENCE WOULD BE GONE WHY

1863-142324-0076 I HAVE SO WORKED AND PLANNED I HAVE DISCOVERED NEW POWERS IN MY SITUATION TOO LATE AND NOW ALL IS OVER I AM TOO OLD TO BEGIN AGAIN WITH THE SAME HEART IT IS HARD MOTHER
1863-142324-0077 HE TURNED AWAY FROM HER AND COVERED HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS I CAN'T THINK SAID SHE WITH GLOOMY DEFIANCE IN HER TONE HOW IT COMES ABOUT HERE IS MY BOY
1863-142324-0078 AND HE FAILS IN ALL HE SETS HIS MIND UPON HE FINDS A WOMAN TO LOVE AND SHE CARES NO MORE FOR HIS AFFECTION THAN IF HE HAD BEEN ANY COMMON MAN HE LABOURS AND HIS LABOUR COMES TO NOUGHT OTHER PEOPLE PROSPER AND GROW RICH
1863-142324-0079 AND HOLD THEIR PALTRY NAMES HIGH AND DRY ABOVE SHAME SHAME NEVER TOUCHED ME SAID HE IN A LOW TONE BUT SHE WENT ON I SOMETIMES HAVE WONDERED WHERE JUSTICE WAS GONE TO AND NOW I DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS SUCH A THING IN THE WORLD
1863-142324-0080 MY OWN JOHN THORNTON THOUGH YOU AND I MAY BE BEGGARS TOGETHER MY OWN DEAR SON SHE FELL UPON HIS NECK AND KISSED HIM THROUGH HER TEARS MOTHER SAID HE HOLDING HER GENTLY IN HIS ARMS
1863-142324-0081 WHO HAS SENT ME MY LOT IN LIFE BOTH OF GOOD AND OF EVIL SHE SHOOK HER HEAD SHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RELIGION JUST THEN MOTHER HE WENT ON SEEING THAT SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK
1863-142324-0082 I TOO HAVE BEEN REBELLIOUS BUT I AM STRIVING TO BE SO NO LONGER HELP ME AS YOU HELPED ME WHEN I WAS A CHILD THEN YOU SAID MANY GOOD WORDS
1863-142324-0083 YOU SAID BRAVE NOBLE TRUSTFUL WORDS THEN MOTHER WHICH I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE LAIN DORMANT SPEAK TO ME AGAIN IN THE OLD WAY MOTHER DO NOT LET US HAVE TO THINK THAT THE WORLD HAS TOO MUCH HARDENED OUR HEARTS
1863-142324-0084 IF YOU WOULD SAY THE OLD GOOD WORDS IT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL SOMETHING OF THE PIOUS SIMPLICITY OF MY CHILDHOOD I SAY THEM TO MYSELF BUT THEY WOULD COME DIFFERENTLY FROM YOU REMEMBERING ALL THE CARES AND TRIALS
1863-142324-0085 YOU HAVE HAD TO BEAR I HAVE HAD A MANY SAID SHE SOBBING BUT NONE SO SORE AS THIS TO SEE YOU CAST DOWN FROM YOUR RIGHTFUL PLACE
1863-142324-0086 NOT FOR YOU GOD HAS SEEN FIT TO BE VERY HARD ON YOU VERY SHE SHOOK WITH THE SOBS THAT COME SO CONVULSIVELY WHEN AN OLD PERSON WEEPS THE SILENCE AROUND HER STRUCK HER AT LAST
1863-142324-0087 AND SHE QUIETED HERSELF TO LISTEN NO SOUND SHE LOOKED HER SON SATE BY THE TABLE HIS ARMS THROWN HALF ACROSS IT HIS HEAD BENT FACE DOWNWARDS OH JOHN SHE SAID
1863-142324-0088 AND SHE LIFTED HIS FACE UP SUCH A STRANGE PALLID LOOK OF GLOOM WAS ON IT THAT FOR A MOMENT IT STRUCK HER THAT THIS LOOK WAS THE FORERUNNER OF DEATH BUT AS THE RIGIDITY MELTED OUT OF THE COUNTENANCE
1863-142324-0089 AND SHE SAW THAT HE WAS HIMSELF ONCE AGAIN ALL WORLDLY MORTIFICATION SANK TO NOTHING BEFORE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE GREAT BLESSING THAT HE HIMSELF BY HIS SIMPLE EXISTENCE WAS TO HER
1863-142324-0090 SHE THANKED GOD FOR THIS AND THIS ALONE WITH A FERVOUR THAT SWEPT AWAY ALL REBELLIOUS FEELINGS FROM HER MIND HE DID NOT SPEAK READILY BUT HE WENT AND OPENED THE SHUTTERS AND LET THE RUDDY LIGHT OF DAWN FLOOD THE ROOM
1863-142324-0091 BUT THE WIND WAS IN THE EAST THE WEATHER WAS PIERCING COLD AS IT HAD BEEN FOR WEEKS THERE WOULD BE NO DEMAND FOR LIGHT SUMMER GOODS THIS YEAR THAT HOPE FOR THE REVIVAL OF TRADE MUST UTTERLY BE GIVEN UP
1863-142324-0092 IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO HAVE HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH HIS MOTHER AND TO FEEL SURE THAT HOWEVER THEY MIGHT HENCEFORWARD KEEP SILENCE ON ALL THESE ANXIETIES THEY YET UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER'S FEELINGS AND WERE IF NOT IN HARMONY
1863-142324-0093 AT LEAST NOT IN DISCORD WITH EACH OTHER IN THEIR WAY OF VIEWING THEM FANNY'S HUSBAND WAS VEXED AT THORNTON'S REFUSAL TO TAKE ANY SHARE IN THE SPECULATION WHICH HE HAD OFFERED TO HIM
1863-142324-0094 AND WITHDREW FROM ANY POSSIBILITY OF BEING SUPPOSED ABLE TO ASSIST HIM WITH THE READY MONEY WHICH INDEED THE SPECULATOR NEEDED FOR HIS OWN VENTURE THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT AT LAST BUT THAT WHICH MISTER THORNTON HAD DREADED FOR MANY WEEKS
1863-142324-0095 HE HAD TO GIVE UP THE BUSINESS IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN SO LONG ENGAGED WITH SO MUCH HONOUR AND SUCCESS AND LOOK OUT FOR A SUBORDINATE SITUATION MARLBOROUGH MILLS AND THE ADJACENT DWELLING WERE HELD UNDER A LONG LEASE THEY MUST IF POSSIBLE
1863-142324-0096 BE RELET THERE WAS AN IMMEDIATE CHOICE OF SITUATIONS OFFERED TO MISTER THORNTON MISTER HAMPER WOULD HAVE BEEN ONLY TOO GLAD TO HAVE SECURED HIM AS A STEADY AND EXPERIENCED PARTNER FOR HIS SON WHOM HE WAS SETTING UP WITH A LARGE CAPITAL
1863-142324-0097 IN A NEIGHBOURING TOWN BUT THE YOUNG MAN WAS HALF EDUCATED AS REGARDED INFORMATION AND WHOLLY UNEDUCATED AS REGARDED ANY OTHER RESPONSIBILITY THAN THAT OF GETTING MONEY AND BRUTALISED BOTH AS TO HIS PLEASURES AND HIS PAINS
1863-142324-0098 MISTER THORNTON DECLINED HAVING ANY SHARE IN A PARTNERSHIP WHICH WOULD FRUSTRATE WHAT FEW PLANS HE HAD THAT SURVIVED THE WRECK OF HIS FORTUNES HE WOULD SOONER CONSENT TO BE ONLY A MANAGER WHERE HE COULD HAVE A CERTAIN DEGREE OF POWER BEYOND THE MERE MONEY GETTING PART
1863-142324-0099 THAN HAVE TO FALL IN WITH THE TYRANNICAL HUMOURS OF A MONEYED PARTNER WITH WHOM HE FELT SURE THAT HE SHOULD QUARREL IN A FEW MONTHS SO HE WAITED AND STOOD ON ONE SIDE WITH PROFOUND HUMILITY AS THE NEWS SWEPT THROUGH THE EXCHANGE
1863-142324-0100 OF THE ENORMOUS FORTUNE WHICH HIS BROTHER IN LAW HAD MADE BY HIS DARING SPECULATION IT WAS A NINE DAYS WONDER SUCCESS BROUGHT WITH IT ITS WORLDLY CONSEQUENCE OF EXTREME ADMIRATION
