2992-164100-0000 SLAVES AS WE DESCENDED THE BROAD STAIRCASE WHICH LED TO THE MAIN AVENUE OF PHUTRA I CAUGHT MY FIRST SIGHT OF THE DOMINANT RACE OF THE INNER WORLD INVOLUNTARILY I SHRANK BACK AS ONE OF THE CREATURES APPROACHED TO INSPECT US
2992-164100-0001 A MORE HIDEOUS THING IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE
2992-164100-0002 WITH LONG NARROW HEADS AND GREAT ROUND EYES THEIR BEAK LIKE MOUTHS ARE LINED WITH SHARP WHITE FANGS AND THE BACKS OF THEIR HUGE LIZARD BODIES ARE SERRATED INTO BONY RIDGES FROM THEIR NECKS TO THE END OF THEIR LONG TAILS
2992-164100-0003 THEIR FEET ARE EQUIPPED WITH THREE WEBBED TOES WHILE FROM THE FORE FEET MEMBRANOUS WINGS WHICH ARE ATTACHED TO THEIR BODIES JUST IN FRONT OF THE HIND LEGS PROTRUDE AT AN ANGLE OF FORTY FIVE DEGREES TOWARD THE REAR
2992-164100-0004 ENDING IN SHARP POINTS SEVERAL FEET ABOVE THEIR BODIES I GLANCED AT PERRY AS THE THING PASSED ME TO INSPECT HIM
2992-164100-0005 WHEN IT PASSED ON HE TURNED TO ME A RHAMPHORHYNCHUS OF THE MIDDLE OLITIC DAVID HE SAID BUT GAD HOW ENORMOUS
2992-164100-0006 HAVE NEVER INDICATED A SIZE GREATER THAN THAT ATTAINED BY AN ORDINARY CROW AS WE CONTINUED ON THROUGH THE MAIN AVENUE OF PHUTRA
2992-164100-0007 THEY PAID BUT LITTLE ATTENTION TO US PHUTRA IS LAID OUT UNDERGROUND WITH A REGULARITY THAT INDICATES REMARKABLE ENGINEERING SKILL IT IS HEWN FROM SOLID LIMESTONE STRATA THE STREETS ARE BROAD AND OF A UNIFORM HEIGHT OF TWENTY FEET
2992-164100-0008 AT INTERVALS TUBES PIERCE THE ROOF OF THIS UNDERGROUND CITY AND BY MEANS OF LENSES AND REFLECTORS TRANSMIT THE SUNLIGHT SOFTENED AND DIFFUSED
2992-164100-0009 IN LIKE MANNER AIR IS INTRODUCED
2992-164100-0010 TO A LARGE PUBLIC BUILDING WHERE ONE OF THE SAGOTHS WHO HAD FORMED OUR GUARD
2992-164100-0011 THE METHOD OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THESE TWO WAS REMARKABLE IN THAT NO SPOKEN WORDS WERE EXCHANGED THEY EMPLOYED A SPECIES OF SIGN LANGUAGE AS I WAS TO LEARN LATER THE MAHARS HAVE NO EARS NOT ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE
2992-164100-0012 AMONG THEMSELVES THEY COMMUNICATE BY MEANS OF WHAT PERRY SAYS MUST BE A SIXTH SENSE WHICH IS COGNIZANT OF A FOURTH DIMENSION I NEVER DID QUITE GRASP HIM
2992-164100-0013 I SUGGESTED TELEPATHY BUT HE SAID NO THAT IT WAS NOT TELEPATHY SINCE THEY COULD ONLY COMMUNICATE WHEN IN EACH OTHERS PRESENCE NOR COULD THEY TALK WITH THE SAGOTHS OR THE OTHER INHABITANTS OF PELLUCIDAR BY THE SAME METHOD THEY USED TO CONVERSE WITH ONE ANOTHER
2992-164100-0014 WHAT THEY DO SAID PERRY IS TO PROJECT THEIR THOUGHTS INTO THE FOURTH DIMENSION WHEN THEY BECOME APPRECIABLE TO THE SIXTH SENSE OF THEIR LISTENER DO I MAKE MYSELF QUITE CLEAR
2992-164100-0015 HE SHOOK HIS HEAD IN DESPAIR AND RETURNED TO HIS WORK THEY HAD SET US TO CARRYING A GREAT ACCUMULATION OF MAHARAN LITERATURE FROM ONE APARTMENT TO ANOTHER
2992-164100-0016 I SUGGESTED TO PERRY THAT WE WERE IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY OF PHUTRA BUT LATER AS HE COMMENCED TO DISCOVER THE KEY TO THEIR WRITTEN LANGUAGE HE ASSURED ME THAT WE WERE HANDLING THE ANCIENT ARCHIVES OF THE RACE
2992-164100-0017 DURING THIS PERIOD MY THOUGHTS WERE CONTINUALLY UPON DIAN THE BEAUTIFUL I WAS OF COURSE GLAD THAT SHE HAD ESCAPED THE MAHARS AND
2992-164100-0018 I OFTEN WONDERED IF THE LITTLE PARTY OF FUGITIVES HAD BEEN OVERTAKEN BY THE GUARDS WHO HAD RETURNED TO SEARCH FOR THEM
2992-164100-0019 THAN TO THINK OF HER AT THE MERCY OF HOOJA THE SLY ONE GHAK PERRY AND I OFTEN TALKED TOGETHER OF POSSIBLE ESCAPE BUT THE SARIAN WAS SO STEEPED IN HIS LIFELONG BELIEF THAT NO ONE COULD ESCAPE FROM THE MAHARS EXCEPT BY A MIRACLE
2992-164100-0020 THAT HE WAS NOT MUCH AID TO US HIS ATTITUDE WAS OF ONE WHO WAITS FOR THE MIRACLE TO COME TO HIM AT MY SUGGESTION PERRY AND I FASHIONED SOME SWORDS OF SCRAPS OF IRON
2992-164100-0021 FOR WE WERE PERMITTED ALMOST UNRESTRAINED FREEDOM OF ACTION WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE BUILDING
2992-164100-0022 SO GREAT WERE THE NUMBER OF SLAVES WHO WAITED UPON THE INHABITANTS OF PHUTRA THAT NONE OF US WAS APT TO BE OVERBURDENED WITH WORK NOR WERE OUR MASTERS UNKIND TO US WE HID OUR NEW WEAPONS BENEATH THE SKINS WHICH FORMED OUR BEDS
2992-164100-0023 AND THEN PERRY CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF MAKING BOWS AND ARROWS WEAPONS APPARENTLY UNKNOWN WITHIN PELLUCIDAR NEXT CAME SHIELDS BUT THESE I FOUND IT EASIER TO STEAL FROM THE WALLS OF THE OUTER GUARDROOM OF THE BUILDING
2992-164100-0024 WE HAD COMPLETED THESE ARRANGEMENTS FOR OUR PROTECTION AFTER LEAVING PHUTRA WHEN THE SAGOTHS WHO HAD BEEN SENT TO RECAPTURE THE ESCAPED PRISONERS RETURNED WITH FOUR OF THEM OF WHOM HOOJA WAS ONE DIAN AND TWO OTHERS HAD ELUDED THEM
2992-164100-0025 IT SO HAPPENED THAT HOOJA WAS CONFINED IN THE SAME BUILDING WITH US HE TOLD GHAK THAT HE HAD NOT SEEN DIAN OR THE OTHERS AFTER RELEASING THEM WITHIN THE DARK GROTTO WHAT HAD BECOME OF THEM HE HAD NOT THE FAINTEST CONCEPTION
2992-164100-0026 THEY MIGHT BE WANDERING YET LOST WITHIN THE LABYRINTHINE TUNNEL IF NOT DEAD FROM STARVATION I WAS NOW STILL FURTHER APPREHENSIVE AS TO THE FATE OF DIAN AND AT THIS TIME
2992-164100-0027 I IMAGINE CAME THE FIRST REALIZATION THAT MY AFFECTION FOR THE GIRL MIGHT BE PROMPTED BY MORE THAN FRIENDSHIP DURING MY WAKING HOURS SHE WAS CONSTANTLY THE SUBJECT OF MY THOUGHTS AND WHEN I SLEPT HER DEAR FACE HAUNTED MY DREAMS
2992-164100-0028 PERRY I CONFIDED TO THE OLD MAN
2992-164100-0029 THAT WAS THE EXCUSE I MADE FOR PERRY'S BENEFIT DIMINUTIVE WORLD HE SCOFFED
2992-164100-0030 AND THEN HE SHOWED ME A MAP OF PELLUCIDAR WHICH HE HAD RECENTLY DISCOVERED AMONG THE MANUSCRIPT HE WAS ARRANGING LOOK HE CRIED POINTING TO IT THIS IS EVIDENTLY WATER AND ALL THIS LAND DO YOU NOTICE THE GENERAL CONFIGURATION OF THE TWO AREAS
2992-164100-0031 WHERE THE OCEANS ARE UPON THE OUTER CRUST IS LAND HERE THESE RELATIVELY SMALL AREAS OF OCEAN FOLLOW THE GENERAL LINES OF THE CONTINENTS OF THE OUTER WORLD WE KNOW THAT THE CRUST OF THE GLOBE IS FIVE HUNDRED MILES IN THICKNESS THEN THE INSIDE DIAMETER OF PELLUCIDAR MUST BE SEVEN THOUSAND MILES
2992-164100-0032 AND THE SUPERFICIAL AREA ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION
2992-164100-0033 THREE FOURTHS OF THIS IS LAND THINK OF IT
2992-164100-0034 OUR OWN WORLD CONTAINS BUT FIFTY THREE MILLION SQUARE MILES OF LAND THE BALANCE OF ITS SURFACE BEING COVERED BY WATER JUST AS WE OFTEN COMPARE NATIONS BY THEIR RELATIVE LAND AREAS SO IF WE COMPARE THESE TWO WORLDS IN THE SAME WAY
2992-164100-0035 WE HAVE THE STRANGE ANOMALY OF A LARGER WORLD WITHIN A SMALLER ONE WHERE WITHIN VAST PELLUCIDAR WOULD YOU SEARCH FOR YOUR DIAN WITHOUT STARS OR MOON OR CHANGING SUN HOW COULD YOU FIND HER EVEN THOUGH YOU KNEW WHERE SHE MIGHT BE FOUND THE PROPOSITION WAS A CORKER
2992-164100-0036 IT QUITE TOOK MY BREATH AWAY BUT I FOUND THAT IT LEFT ME ALL THE MORE DETERMINED TO ATTEMPT IT IF GHAK WILL ACCOMPANY US WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO IT I SUGGESTED PERRY AND I SOUGHT HIM OUT AND PUT THE QUESTION STRAIGHT TO HIM GHAK I SAID WE ARE DETERMINED TO ESCAPE FROM THIS BONDAGE WILL YOU ACCOMPANY US
2992-164100-0037 THEY WILL SET THE THIPDARS UPON US HE SAID AND THEN WE SHALL BE KILLED BUT HE HESITATED I WOULD TAKE THE CHANCE IF I THOUGHT THAT I MIGHT POSSIBLY ESCAPE AND RETURN TO MY OWN PEOPLE COULD YOU FIND YOUR WAY BACK TO YOUR OWN LAND ASKED PERRY
2992-164100-0038 AND COULD YOU AID DAVID IN HIS SEARCH FOR DIAN YES BUT HOW PERSISTED PERRY COULD YOU TRAVEL TO STRANGE COUNTRY
2992-164100-0039 GHAK DIDN'T KNOW WHAT PERRY MEANT BY HEAVENLY BODIES OR A COMPASS BUT HE ASSURED US THAT YOU MIGHT BLINDFOLD ANY MAN OF PELLUCIDAR
2992-164100-0040 YET HE WOULD BE ABLE TO COME DIRECTLY TO HIS OWN HOME AGAIN BY THE SHORTEST ROUTE
2992-164100-0041 PERRY SAID IT MUST BE SOME SORT OF HOMING INSTINCT SUCH AS IS POSSESSED BY CERTAIN BREEDS OF EARTHLY PIGEONS I DIDN'T KNOW OF COURSE BUT IT GAVE ME AN IDEA
2992-164100-0042 SURELY REPLIED GHAK UNLESS SOME MIGHTY BEAST OF PREY KILLED HER I WAS FOR MAKING THE ATTEMPTED ESCAPE AT ONCE BUT BOTH PERRY AND GHAK COUNSELED WAITING FOR SOME PROPITIOUS ACCIDENT WHICH WOULD INSURE US SOME SMALL DEGREE OF SUCCESS
2992-164100-0043 I DIDN'T SEE WHAT ACCIDENT COULD BEFALL A WHOLE COMMUNITY IN A LAND OF PERPETUAL DAYLIGHT WHERE THE INHABITANTS HAD NO FIXED HABITS OF SLEEP
2992-164100-0044 WHILE OTHERS MAY AT LONG INTERVALS CRAWL INTO THE DARK RECESSES BENEATH THEIR DWELLINGS AND CURL UP IN PROTRACTED SLUMBER PERRY SAYS THAT IF A MAHAR STAYS AWAKE FOR THREE YEARS HE WILL MAKE UP ALL HIS LOST SLEEP IN A LONG YEAR'S SNOOZE
2992-164100-0045 FOR OUR MEANS OF ESCAPE I HAD BEEN SEARCHING ABOUT FAR BELOW THE LEVELS THAT WE SLAVES WERE SUPPOSED TO FREQUENT POSSIBLY FIFTY FEET BENEATH THE MAIN FLOOR OF THE BUILDING AMONG A NETWORK OF CORRIDORS AND APARTMENTS WHEN I CAME SUDDENLY UPON THREE MAHARS CURLED UP UPON A BED OF SKINS
2992-164100-0046 AT FIRST I THOUGHT THEY WERE DEAD BUT LATER THEIR REGULAR BREATHING CONVINCED ME OF MY ERROR LIKE A FLASH THE THOUGHT CAME TO ME OF THE MARVELOUS OPPORTUNITY THESE SLEEPING REPTILES OFFERED AS A MEANS OF ELUDING THE WATCHFULNESS OF OUR CAPTORS AND THE SAGOTH GUARDS
2992-164100-0047 HASTENING BACK TO PERRY WHERE HE PORED OVER A MUSTY PILE OF TO ME MEANINGLESS HIEROGLYPHICS I EXPLAINED MY PLAN TO HIM TO MY SURPRISE HE WAS HORRIFIED IT WOULD BE MURDER DAVID HE CRIED
2992-164100-0048 MURDER TO KILL A REPTILIAN MONSTER I ASKED IN ASTONISHMENT HERE THEY ARE NOT MONSTERS DAVID HE REPLIED HERE THEY ARE THE DOMINANT RACE WE ARE THE MONSTERS' THE LOWER ORDERS IN PELLUCIDAR EVOLUTION HAS PROGRESSED ALONG DIFFERENT LINES THAN UPON THE OUTER EARTH
2992-164100-0049 THESE TERRIBLE CONVULSIONS OF NATURE TIME AND TIME AGAIN WIPED OUT THE EXISTING SPECIES BUT FOR THIS FACT SOME MONSTER OF THE SAUROZOIC EPOCH MIGHT RULE TODAY UPON OUR OWN WORLD WE SEE HERE WHAT MIGHT WELL HAVE OCCURRED IN OUR OWN HISTORY HAD CONDITIONS
2992-164100-0050 BEEN WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN HERE LIFE WITHIN PELLUCIDAR IS FAR YOUNGER THAN UPON THE OUTER CRUST HERE MAN HAS BUT REACHED A STAGE ANALOGOUS TO THE STONE AGE OF OUR OWN WORLD'S HISTORY BUT FOR COUNTLESS MILLIONS OF YEARS THESE REPTILES HAVE BEEN PROGRESSING
2992-164100-0051 BUT THIS WE MAY NEVER KNOW THEY LOOK UPON US AS WE LOOK UPON THE BEASTS OF OUR FIELDS AND I LEARN FROM THEIR WRITTEN RECORDS THAT OTHER RACES OF MAHARS FEED UPON MEN THEY KEEP THEM IN GREAT DROVES AS WE KEEP CATTLE THEY BREED THEM MOST CAREFULLY AND WHEN THEY ARE QUITE FAT
2992-164100-0052 THEY KILL AND EAT THEM I SHUDDERED WHAT IS THERE HORRIBLE ABOUT IT DAVID THE OLD MAN ASKED THEY UNDERSTAND US NO BETTER THAN WE UNDERSTAND THE LOWER ANIMALS OF OUR OWN WORLD WHY
2992-164100-0053 GILAKS THAT IS MEN HAVE ANY MEANS OF COMMUNICATION ONE WRITER CLAIMS THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REASON THAT OUR EVERY ACT IS MECHANICAL OR INSTINCTIVE THE DOMINANT RACE OF PELLUCIDAR DAVID HAVE NOT YET LEARNED THAT MEN CONVERSE AMONG THEMSELVES OR REASON
2992-164100-0054 THEY KNOW THAT THE SAGOTHS HAVE A SPOKEN LANGUAGE BUT THEY CANNOT COMPREHEND IT OR HOW IT MANIFESTS ITSELF SINCE THEY HAVE NO AUDITORY APPARATUS THEY BELIEVE THAT THE MOTIONS OF THE LIPS ALONE CONVEY THE MEANING
2992-164100-0055 THAT THE SAGOTHS CAN COMMUNICATE WITH US IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO THEM YES DAVID HE CONCLUDED IT WOULD ENTAIL MURDER TO CARRY OUT YOUR PLAN VERY WELL THEN PERRY I REPLIED I SHALL BECOME A MURDERER HE GOT ME TO GO OVER THE PLAN AGAIN MOST CAREFULLY
2992-164100-0056 I WONDER DAVID HE SAID AT LENGTH
2992-164100-0057 FOR THE HUMAN RACE OF PELLUCIDAR AT THE SAME TIME LISTEN I HAVE LEARNED MUCH OF A MOST SURPRISING NATURE FROM THESE ARCHIVES OF THE MAHARS
2992-164100-0058 ONCE THE MALES WERE ALL POWERFUL BUT AGES AGO THE FEMALES LITTLE BY LITTLE ASSUMED THE MASTERY FOR OTHER AGES NO NOTICEABLE CHANGE TOOK PLACE IN THE RACE OF MAHARS IT CONTINUED TO PROGRESS UNDER THE INTELLIGENT AND BENEFICENT RULE OF THE LADIES
2992-164100-0059 SCIENCE TOOK VAST STRIDES THIS WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF THE SCIENCES WHICH WE KNOW AS BIOLOGY AND EUGENICS FINALLY A CERTAIN FEMALE SCIENTIST ANNOUNCED THE FACT THAT SHE HAD DISCOVERED A METHOD WHEREBY EGGS MIGHT BE FERTILIZED BY CHEMICAL MEANS
2992-164100-0060 AFTER THEY WERE LAID ALL TRUE REPTILES YOU KNOW ARE HATCHED FROM EGGS WHAT HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY THE NECESSITY FOR MALES CEASED TO EXIST THE RACE WAS NO LONGER DEPENDENT UPON THEM
2992-164100-0061 EXCLUSIVELY OF FEMALES BUT HERE IS THE POINT THE SECRET OF THIS CHEMICAL FORMULA IS KEPT BY A SINGLE RACE OF MAHARS
2992-164100-0062 I JUDGE FROM YOUR DESCRIPTION OF THE VAULTS THROUGH WHICH YOU PASSED TODAY THAT IT LIES HIDDEN IN THE CELLAR OF THIS BUILDING FOR TWO REASONS THEY HIDE IT AWAY AND GUARD IT JEALOUSLY FIRST BECAUSE UPON IT DEPENDS THE VERY LIFE OF THE RACE OF MAHARS AND SECOND
2992-164100-0063 OWING TO THE FACT THAT WHEN IT WAS PUBLIC PROPERTY AS AT FIRST SO MANY WERE EXPERIMENTING WITH IT THAT THE DANGER OF OVER POPULATION BECAME VERY GRAVE DAVID IF WE CAN ESCAPE AND AT THE SAME TIME TAKE WITH US THIS GREAT SECRET
2992-164100-0064 WHAT WILL WE NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED FOR THE HUMAN RACE WITHIN PELLUCIDAR THE VERY THOUGHT OF IT FAIRLY OVERPOWERED ME WHY WE TWO WOULD BE THE MEANS OF PLACING THE MEN OF THE INNER WORLD IN THEIR RIGHTFUL PLACE AMONG CREATED THINGS
2992-164100-0065 ONLY THE SAGOTHS WOULD THEN STAND BETWEEN THEM AND ABSOLUTE SUPREMACY AND I WAS NOT QUITE SURE BUT THAT THE SAGOTHS OWED ALL THEIR POWER TO THE GREATER INTELLIGENCE OF THE MAHARS I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE GORILLA LIKE BEASTS WERE THE MENTAL SUPERIORS OF THE HUMAN RACE OF PELLUCIDAR
2992-164100-0066 WHY PERRY I EXCLAIMED YOU AND I MAY RECLAIM A WHOLE WORLD TOGETHER WE CAN LEAD THE RACES OF MEN OUT OF THE DARKNESS OF IGNORANCE INTO THE LIGHT OF ADVANCEMENT AND CIVILIZATION
2992-164100-0067 AT ONE STEP WE MAY CARRY THEM FROM THE AGE OF STONE TO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY IT'S MARVELOUS ABSOLUTELY MARVELOUS JUST TO THINK ABOUT IT DAVID SAID THE OLD MAN I BELIEVE THAT GOD SENT US HERE FOR JUST THAT PURPOSE IT SHALL BE MY LIFE WORK TO TEACH THEM HIS WORD
2992-164100-0068 TO LEAD THEM INTO THE LIGHT OF HIS MERCY WHILE WE ARE TRAINING THEIR HEARTS AND HANDS IN THE WAYS OF CULTURE AND CIVILIZATION YOU ARE RIGHT PERRY I SAID AND WHILE YOU ARE TEACHING THEM TO PRAY I'LL BE TEACHING THEM TO FIGHT AND BETWEEN US WE'LL MAKE A RACE OF MEN THAT WILL BE AN HONOR TO US BOTH
2992-164100-0069 GHAK HAD ENTERED THE APARTMENT SOME TIME BEFORE WE CONCLUDED OUR CONVERSATION AND NOW HE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WE WERE SO EXCITED ABOUT PERRY THOUGHT WE HAD BEST NOT TELL HIM TOO MUCH AND SO I ONLY EXPLAINED THAT I HAD A PLAN FOR ESCAPE
2992-164100-0070 WHEN I HAD OUTLINED IT TO HIM HE SEEMED ABOUT AS HORROR STRUCK AS PERRY HAD BEEN BUT FOR A DIFFERENT REASON THE HAIRY ONE ONLY CONSIDERED THE HORRIBLE FATE THAT WOULD BE OURS WERE WE DISCOVERED BUT AT LAST I PREVAILED UPON HIM TO ACCEPT MY PLAN AS THE ONLY FEASIBLE ONE
