6167-73972-0000 THE WORSHIP OF FALSE GODS SEVERAL TIMES DURING THESE NOTES I HAVE SPOKEN IN A DISPARAGING MANNER OF THE SHOW TABLE AND I HAVE NOT DONE SO LIGHTLY BUT WITH ALL THE CARE AND THOUGHT AND POWER OF OBSERVATION
6167-73972-0001 THAT MY LIMITED CAPACITY IS WORTH AND BROADLY I HAVE COME TO THIS THAT SHOWS SUCH AS THOSE AT THE FORTNIGHTLY MEETINGS OF THE ROYAL HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY AND THEIR MORE IMPORTANT ONE IN THE EARLY SUMMER
6167-73972-0002 WHOSE OBJECT IS TO BRING TOGETHER BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS OF ALL KINDS TO A PLACE WHERE THEY MAY BE SEEN ARE OF THE UTMOST VALUE AND THAT ANY SHOWS ANYWHERE FOR A LIKE PURPOSE AND ESPECIALLY WHERE THERE ARE NO MONEY PRIZES
6167-73972-0003 ARE ALSO SURE TO BE HELPFUL
6167-73972-0004 DOES THIS REALLY HELP THE BEST INTERESTS OF HORTICULTURE AND AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THAT IT DOES THIS I THINK THE SHOW RIGHT AND HELPFUL AND WHENEVER IT DOES NOT I THINK IT HARMFUL AND MISLEADING
6167-73972-0005 THE LOVE OF GARDENING HAS SO GREATLY GROWN AND SPREAD WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT THE NEED OF REALLY GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL GARDEN FLOWERS IS ALREADY FAR IN ADVANCE OF THE DEMAND FOR THE SO CALLED
6167-73972-0006 FLORISTS FLOWERS BY WHICH I MEAN THOSE THAT FIND FAVOUR IN THE EXCLUSIVE SHOWS OF SOCIETIES FOR THE GROWING AND EXHIBITION OF SUCH FLOWERS AS TULIPS CARNATIONS DAHLIAS AND CHRYSANTHEMUMS IN SUPPORT OF THIS I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
6167-73972-0007 WHAT PROPORTION OF DEMAND THERE IS IN DAHLIAS FOR INSTANCE BETWEEN THE SHOW KINDS WHOSE AIM AND OBJECT IS THE SHOW TABLE AND THE DECORATIVE KINDS THAT ARE INDISPUTABLY BETTER FOR GARDEN USE LOOKING AT THE CATALOGUE
6167-73972-0008 OF A LEADING DAHLIA NURSERY I FIND THAT THE DECORATIVE KINDS FILL TEN PAGES WHILE THE SHOW KINDS INCLUDING POMPONES FILL ONLY THREE
6167-73972-0009 I AM OF OPINION THAT THE SHOW TABLE IS UNWORTHILY USED WHEN ITS OBJECT IS TO BE AN END IN ITSELF AND THAT IT SHOULD BE ONLY A MEANS TO A BETTER END AND THAT WHEN IT EXHIBITS WHAT HAS BECOME MERELY A FANCY
6167-73972-0010 IT LOSES SIGHT OF ITS HONOURABLE POSITION AS A TRUSTWORTHY EXPONENT OF HORTICULTURE AND HAS DEGENERATED TO A BASER USE WHEN AS IN CHRYSANTHEMUM SHOWS
6167-73972-0011 NO USE ANYWHERE BUT ON THAT BOARD AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF GAINING A MONEY PRIZE I HOLD THAT THE SHOW TABLE HAS A DEBASED AIM AND A DEBASING INFLUENCE BEAUTY
6167-73972-0012 IN ALL THE BEST SENSE IS PUT ASIDE IN FAVOUR OF SET RULES AND MEASUREMENTS AND THE PRODUCTION OF A THING THAT IS OF NO USE OR VALUE AND INDIVIDUALS OF A RACE OF PLANTS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING THE HIGHEST AND MOST DELIGHTFUL FORMS OF BEAUTY
6167-73972-0013 AND OF BRIGHTENING OUR HOMES AND EVEN GARDENS DURING THE DIM DAYS OF EARLY WINTER ARE TEASED AND TORTURED AND FATTED AND BLOATED INTO UGLY AND USELESS MONSTROSITIES FOR NO PURPOSE BUT TO GAIN MONEY
6167-73972-0014 AND WHEN PRIVATE GARDENERS GO TO THESE SHOWS AND SEE HOW THE PRIZES ARE AWARDED AND HOW ALL THE GLORY IS ACCORDED TO THE FIRST PRIZE BLOATED MONSTER CAN WE WONDER THAT THE EFFECT ON THEIR MINDS IS CONFUSING
6167-73972-0015 IF NOT ABSOLUTELY HARMFUL SHOWS OF CARNATIONS AND PANSIES WHERE THE OLDER RULES PREVAIL ARE EQUALLY MISLEADING
6167-73972-0016 AS WITH THE CHRYSANTHEMUM EVERY SORT OF TRICKERY IS ALLOWED IN ARRANGING THE PETALS OF THE CARNATION BLOOMS PETALS ARE PULLED OUT OR STUCK IN AND THEY ARE TWISTED ABOUT AND GROOMED AND COMBED AND MANIPULATED WITH SPECIAL TOOLS
6167-73972-0017 DRESSED AS THE SHOW WORD HAS IT DRESSED SO ELABORATELY THAT THE DRESSING ONLY STOPS SHORT OF APPLYING ACTUAL PAINT AND PERFUMERY ALREADY IN THE CASE OF CARNATIONS A BETTER INFLUENCE IS BEING FELT
6167-73972-0018 AND AT THE LONDON SHOWS THERE ARE NOW CLASSES FOR BORDER CARNATIONS SET UP IN LONG STALKED BUNCHES JUST AS THEY GROW IT IS ONLY LIKE THIS THAT THEIR VALUE AS OUTDOOR PLANTS CAN BE TESTED
6167-73972-0019 FOR MANY OF THE SHOW SORTS HAVE MISERABLY WEAK STALKS AND A VERY POOR LANKY HABIT OF GROWTH THEN THE POOR PANSIES HAVE SINGLE BLOOMS LAID FLAT ON WHITE PAPERS AND ARE ONLY APPROVED
6167-73972-0020 IF THEY WILL LIE QUITE FLAT AND SHOW AN OUTLINE OF A PERFECT CIRCLE ALL THAT IS MOST BEAUTIFUL IN A PANSY THE WING LIKE CURVES THE WAVED OR SLIGHTLY FLUTED RADIATIONS THE SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE
6167-73972-0021 THAT DISPLAYS TO PERFECTION THE ADMIRABLE DELICACY OF VELVETY TEXTURE ALL THE LITTLE TENDER TRICKS AND WAYS THAT MAKE THE PANSY ONE OF THE BEST LOVED OF GARDEN FLOWERS ALL THIS IS OVERLOOKED
6167-73972-0022 AND NOT ONLY PASSIVELY OVERLOOKED BUT OVERTLY CONTEMNED THE SHOW PANSY JUDGE APPEARS TO HAVE NO EYE OR BRAIN OR HEART BUT TO HAVE IN THEIR PLACE A PAIR OF COMPASSES WITH WHICH TO DESCRIBE A CIRCLE
6167-73972-0023 ALL IDEA OF GARDEN DELIGHT SEEMS TO BE EXCLUDED AS THIS KIND OF JUDGING APPEALS TO NO RECOGNITION OF BEAUTY FOR BEAUTY'S SAKE BUT TO HARD SYSTEMS OF MEASUREMENT
6167-73972-0024 AND RIGID ARRANGEMENT AND COMPUTATION THAT ONE WOULD THINK MORE APPLICABLE TO ASTRONOMY OR GEOMETRY THAN TO ANY MATTER RELATING TO HORTICULTURE I DO MOST STRONGLY URGE THAT BEAUTY OF THE HIGHEST CLASS SHOULD BE THE AIM
6167-73972-0025 AND NOT ANYTHING OF THE NATURE OF FASHION OR FANCY AND THAT EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TOWARDS THE RAISING RATHER THAN THE LOWERING OF THE STANDARD OF TASTE THE SOCIETIES WHICH EXIST THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ARE WELL ORGANISED
6167-73972-0026 MANY HAVE EXISTED FOR A GREAT NUMBER OF YEARS THEY ARE THE LOCAL SOURCES OF HORTICULTURAL EDUCATION TO WHICH LARGE CIRCLES OF PEOPLE NATURALLY LOOK FOR GUIDANCE AND THOUGH THEY PRODUCE AND ESPECIALLY THE ROSE SHOWS
6167-73972-0027 QUANTITIES OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS IT CANNOT BUT BE PERCEIVED BY ALL WHO HAVE HAD THE BENEFIT OF SOME REFINEMENT OF EDUCATION THAT IN VERY MANY CASES THEY EITHER DELIBERATELY TEACH OR AT ANY RATE ALLOW TO BE SEEN WITH THEIR SANCTION
6167-73972-0028 WHAT CANNOT FAIL TO BE DEBASING TO PUBLIC TASTE I WILL JUST TAKE TWO EXAMPLES TO SHOW HOW OBVIOUS METHODS OF LEADING TASTE ARE NOT ONLY OVERLOOKED BUT EVEN PERVERTED
6167-73972-0029 FOR IT IS NOT ONLY IN THE INDIVIDUAL BLOOMS THAT MUCH OF THE SHOW TEACHING IS UNWORTHY BUT ALSO IN THE TRAINING OF THE PLANTS SO THAT A PLANT THAT BY NATURE HAS SOME BEAUTY OF FORM
6167-73972-0030 IS NOT ENCOURAGED OR EVEN ALLOWED TO DEVELOP THAT BEAUTY BUT IS TRAINED INTO SOME SHAPE THAT IS NOT ONLY FOREIGN TO ITS OWN NATURE BUT IS ABSOLUTELY UGLY AND UNGRACEFUL AND ENTIRELY STUPID
6167-73972-0031 THE NATURAL HABIT OF THE CHRYSANTHEMUM IS TO GROW IN THE FORM OF SEVERAL UPRIGHT STEMS THEY SPRING UP SHEAF WISE STRAIGHT UPRIGHT FOR A TIME AND ONLY BENDING A LITTLE OUTWARDS ABOVE TO GIVE ROOM FOR THE BRANCHING HEADS OF BLOOM
6167-73972-0032 THE STEMS ARE RATHER STIFF BECAUSE THEY ARE HALF WOODY AT THE BASE IN THE CASE OF POT PLANTS IT WOULD SEEM RIGHT ONLY SO FAR TO STAKE OR TRAIN THEM AS TO GIVE THE NECESSARY SUPPORT
6167-73972-0033 SO THAT EACH STEM MAY LEAN A LITTLE OVER
6167-73972-0034 WHEN THEIR CLUSTERED HEADS OF FLOWER WOULD BE GIVEN ENOUGH ROOM AND BE SEEN TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE BUT AT SHOWS THE TRIUMPH OF THE TRAINING ART SEEMS TO BE TO DRAG THE POOR THING ROUND AND ROUND
6167-73972-0035 OVER AN INTERNAL SCAFFOLDING OF STICKS WITH AN INFINITE NUMBER OF TIES AND CROSS BRACES SO THAT IT MAKES A SORT OF SHAPELESS BALL AND TO ARRANGE THE FLOWERS SO THAT THEY ARE EQUALLY SPOTTED ALL OVER IT BY TYING BACK SOME ALMOST TO SNAPPING POINT
6167-73972-0036 I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SO UGLY
6167-73972-0037 TRAINED IN THIS MANNER SUCH A SIGHT GIVES ME A FEELING OF SHAME NOT UNMIXED WITH WRATHFUL INDIGNATION I ASK MYSELF WHAT IS IT FOR
6167-73972-0038 OH IT IS ONE OF THE WAYS THEY ARE TRAINED FOR SHOWS I ASK HIM DOES HE THINK IT PRETTY OR IS IT ANY USE AND HE SAYS WELL THEY THINK IT MAKES A NICE VARIETY AND WHEN I PRESS HIM FURTHER
6167-73972-0039 THE QUESTION IS BEYOND HIM AND HE SMILES VAGUELY AND EDGES AWAY EVIDENTLY THINKING MY CONVERSATION PERPLEXING AND MY COMPANY UNDESIRABLE
6167-73972-0040 AND SEEMING TO SAY WE WERE REALLY A GOOD BIT MILDEWED BUT HAVE BEEN DOCTORED UP FOR THE SHOW BY BEING CRAMMED AND STUFFED WITH ARTIFICIAL ALIMENT MY SECOND EXAMPLE IS THAT OF AZALEA INDICA
6167-73972-0041 WHAT IS PRETTIER IN A ROOM THAN ONE OF THESE IN ITS LITTLE TREE FORM A TRUE TREE WITH TINY TRUNK AND WIDE SPREADING BRANCHES AND ITS ABSURDLY LARGE AND LOVELY FLOWERS SURELY IT IS THE MOST PERFECT ROOM ORNAMENT
6167-73972-0042 THAT WE CAN HAVE IN TREE SHAPE IN A MODERATE SIZED POT AND WHERE ELSE CAN ONE SEE A TREE LOADED WITH LOVELY BLOOM WHOSE INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS HAVE A DIAMETER EQUAL TO FIVE TIMES THAT OF THE TRUNK
6167-73972-0043 BUT THE SHOW DECREES THAT ALL THIS IS WRONG AND THAT THE TINY BRITTLE BRANCHES MUST BE TRAINED STIFFLY ROUND TILL THE SHAPE OF THE PLANT SHOWS AS A SORT OF CYLINDER AGAIN I ASK MYSELF WHAT IS THIS FOR WHAT DOES IT TEACH
6167-73972-0044 CAN IT BE REALLY TO TEACH WITH DELIBERATE INTENTION THAT INSTEAD OF DISPLAYING ITS NATURAL AND GRACEFUL TREE FORM IT SHOULD AIM AT A MORE DESIRABLE KIND OF BEAUTY SUCH AS THAT OF THE CHIMNEY POT OR DRAIN PIPE AND THAT THIS IS SO IMPORTANT
6167-73972-0045 THAT IT IS RIGHT AND LAUDABLE TO DEVOTE TO IT MUCH TIME AND DELICATE WORKMANSHIP I CANNOT BUT THINK AS WELL AS HOPE THAT THE STRONG INFLUENCES FOR GOOD THAT ARE NOW BEING BROUGHT TO BEAR ON ALL DEPARTMENTS OF GARDENING
6167-73972-0046 MAY REACH THIS CLASS OF SHOW FOR THERE ARE ALREADY MORE HOPEFUL SIGNS IN THE ADMISSION OF CLASSES FOR GROUPS ARRANGED FOR DECORATION THE PRIZE SHOW SYSTEM NO DOUBT CREATES ITS OWN EVILS BECAUSE THE JUDGES
6167-73972-0047 AND THOSE WHO FRAME THE SCHEDULES HAVE BEEN IN MOST CASES MEN WHO HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF FLOWERS BUT WHO ARE NOT PEOPLE OF CULTIVATED TASTE AND IN DECIDING WHAT POINTS ARE TO CONSTITUTE THE MERITS OF A FLOWER
6167-73972-0048 THEY HAVE TO TAKE SUCH QUALITIES AS ARE WITHIN THE CLEAREST UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLE OF AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE AND AVERAGE EDUCATION SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS SIZE THAT CAN BE MEASURED SYMMETRY THAT CAN BE EASILY ESTIMATED THICKNESS OF PETAL THAT CAN BE FELT
6167-73972-0049 SO THAT A FLOWER MAY POSSESS FEATURES OR QUALITIES THAT ENDOW IT WITH THE HIGHEST BEAUTY BUT THAT EXCLUDE IT BECAUSE THE HARD AND NARROW LIMITS OF THE SHOW LAWS PROVIDE NO MEANS OF DEALING WITH IT IT IS THEREFORE THROWN OUT
6167-73972-0050 NOT BECAUSE THEY HAVE ANY FAULT TO FIND WITH IT BUT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CONCERN THEM AND THE ORDINARY GARDENER TO WHOSE PRACTICE IT MIGHT BE OF THE HIGHEST VALUE ACCEPTING THE VERDICT OF THE SHOW JUDGE AS AN INFALLIBLE GUIDE
6167-73972-0051 ALSO TREATS IT WITH CONTEMPT AND NEGLECT NOW ALL THIS WOULD NOT SO MUCH MATTER IF IT DID NOT DELUDE THOSE WHOSE TASTE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY EDUCATED TO ENABLE THEM TO FORM AN OPINION OF THEIR OWN
6167-73972-0052 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BEST AND TRUEST STANDARDS OF BEAUTY FOR I VENTURE TO REPEAT THAT WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR GARDENS AND FOR OUR OWN BETTERING AND INCREASE OF HAPPINESS IN THOSE GARDENS ARE THINGS THAT ARE BEAUTIFUL
6167-73972-0053 FOR ALL THESE FALSE GODS ARE AMONG US
