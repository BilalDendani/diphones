4422-23272-0000 HER SATISFACTION WAS AS EVIDENT AS EVERY OTHER PERSON'S
4422-23272-0001 EITHER TO EXHORT HER TO HER DUTY OR TO WARN HER AGAINST HER FOLLY SHE WAS EVEN IN PERFECT GOOD HUMOUR WITH MISS FENTON AND ADDED FRIENDSHIP TO HOSPITALITY
4422-23272-0002 MISTER SANDFORD WHO CAME WITH LORD ELMWOOD TO THE NEIGHBOURING SEAT
4422-23272-0003 AT HER'S WAS SO SCRUPULOUSLY EXACT IN THE OBSERVANCE OF HIS WORD NEVER TO ENTER A HOUSE OF MISS MILNER'S THAT HE WOULD NOT EVEN CALL UPON HIS FRIEND DORRIFORTH THERE BUT IN THEIR WALKS AND AT LORD ELMWOOD'S
4422-23272-0004 THE TWO PARTIES WOULD OCCASIONALLY JOIN AND OF COURSE SANDFORD AND SHE AT THOSE TIMES MET YET SO DISTANT
4422-23272-0005 MISS MILNER DID NOT LIKE MISTER SANDFORD
4422-23272-0006 SHE FREQUENTLY FELT CONCERNED THAT HE DID NOT SPEAK TO HER ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN TO FIND FAULT AS USUAL
4422-23272-0007 DRAWING TOWARDS HER HOUSE WHERE LORD ELMWOOD WAS INVITED TO DINE
4422-23272-0008 BUT THOUGH SHE HAD THE GENEROSITY TO FORGIVE AN AFFRONT SHE HAD NOT THE HUMILITY TO MAKE A CONCESSION AND SHE FORESAW THAT NOTHING LESS THAN SOME VERY HUMBLE ATONEMENT ON HER PART WOULD PREVAIL UPON THE HAUGHTY PRIEST TO BE RECONCILED
4422-23272-0009 DORRIFORTH SAW HER CONCERN UPON THIS LAST TRIFLING OCCASION WITH A SECRET PLEASURE AND AN ADMIRATION THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE EXCITED SHE ONCE INSINUATED TO HIM TO BE A MEDIATOR BETWEEN THEM
4422-23272-0010 BUT BEFORE ANY ACCOMMODATION COULD TAKE PLACE THE PEACE AND COMPOSURE OF THEIR ABODE
4422-23272-0011 AT A DINNER GIVEN BY LORD ELMWOOD SIR EDWARD WAS ANNOUNCED AS AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR MISS MILNER DID NOT SUPPOSE HIM SUCH
4422-23272-0012 DORRIFORTH FIXED HIS EYES UPON HER WITH SOME TOKENS OF COMPASSION WHILE SANDFORD SEEMED TO EXULT AND BY HIS REPEATED WELCOMES TO THE BARONET GAVE PROOFS HOW MUCH HE WAS REJOICED TO SEE HIM
4422-23272-0013 ALL THE DECLINING ENMITY OF MISS MILNER WAS RENEWED AT THIS BEHAVIOUR AND SUSPECTING SANDFORD AS THE INSTIGATOR OF THE VISIT SHE COULD NOT OVERCOME HER DISPLEASURE
4422-23272-0014 SIR EDWARD IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION ENQUIRED
4422-23272-0015 NAMED LORD FREDERICK LAWNLY AS BEING HOURLY EXPECTED AT HIS UNCLE'S THE COLOUR SPREAD OVER SIR EDWARD'S FACE DORRIFORTH WAS CONFOUNDED AND MISTER SANDFORD LOOKED ENRAGED DID LORD FREDERICK TELL YOU HE SHOULD BE DOWN
4422-23272-0016 SANDFORD ASKED OF DORRIFORTH TO WHICH HE REPLIED NO BUT I HOPE MISTER SANDFORD YOU WILL PERMIT ME TO KNOW SAID MISS MILNER FOR AS SHE NOW MEANT TO TORMENT HIM BY WHAT SHE SAID
4422-23272-0017 HE HAD NO LONGER ANY OBJECTION TO MAKE A REPLY AND THEREFORE ANSWERED NO MADAM IF IT DEPENDED UPON MY PERMISSION YOU SHOULD NOT KNOW
4422-23272-0018 I WOULD FROM A SELF INTERESTED MOTIVE MISTER SANDFORD THAT I MIGHT HAVE A GREATER RESPECT FOR YOU SOME OF THE COMPANY LAUGHED MISSUS HORTON COUGHED MISS WOODLEY BLUSHED LORD ELMWOOD SNEERED DORRIFORTH FROWNED
4422-23272-0019 WHERE SHE HAD BEEN TAKING OFF SOME PART OF HER DRESS WHEN DORRIFORTH'S SERVANT CAME TO ACQUAINT HER THAT HIS MASTER WAS ALONE IN HIS STUDY AND BEGGED TO SPEAK WITH HER
4422-23272-0020 SHE IMMEDIATELY EXPERIENCED A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE HAD NOT ACTED PROPERLY AT LORD ELMWOOD'S
4422-23272-0021 A PRESENTIMENT THAT HER GUARDIAN WAS GOING TO UPBRAID HER
4422-23272-0022 MISS WOODLEY JUST THEN ENTERED HER APARTMENT AND SHE FOUND HERSELF SO MUCH A COWARD
4422-23272-0023 EXCUSE WHAT YOU MY DEAR RETURNED MISS WOODLEY
4422-23272-0024 THREE HOURS AGO HAD THE COURAGE TO VINDICATE YOUR OWN CAUSE BEFORE A WHOLE COMPANY OF WHOM MANY WERE YOUR ADVERSARIES DO YOU WANT AN ADVOCATE BEFORE YOUR GUARDIAN ALONE WHO HAS EVER TREATED YOU WITH TENDERNESS
4422-23272-0025 IT IS THAT VERY TENDERNESS WHICH FRIGHTENS ME WHICH INTIMIDATES AND STRIKES ME DUMB
4422-23272-0026 AND AS I AM DEBARRED FROM THAT RESOURCE WHAT CAN I DO BUT STAND BEFORE HIM LIKE A GUILTY CREATURE ACKNOWLEDGING MY FAULTS SHE AGAIN ENTREATED HER FRIEND TO GO WITH HER BUT ON A POSITIVE REFUSAL FROM THE IMPROPRIETY OF SUCH AN INTRUSION
4422-23272-0027 SHE WAS OBLIGED AT LENGTH TO GO BY HERSELF HOW MUCH DOES THE DIFFERENCE OF EXTERIOR CIRCUMSTANCES INFLUENCE NOT ONLY THE MANNERS BUT EVEN THE PERSONS OF SOME PEOPLE MISS MILNER IN LORD ELMWOOD'S DRAWING ROOM
4422-23272-0028 GUARDIAN AND FRIEND ARE TWO DIFFERENT BEINGS
4422-23272-0029 WHEN SHE ARRIVED AT THE DOOR OF THE STUDY SHE OPENED IT WITH A TREPIDATION SHE COULD HARDLY ACCOUNT FOR
4422-23272-0030 AND HIS FACE HAD ASSUMED
4422-23272-0031 INSTEAD OF THE ANGER WITH WHICH HE WAS PREPARED TO BEGIN HIS VOICE INVOLUNTARILY SOFTENED AND WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HE SAID HE BEGAN
4422-23272-0032 SHE EXPECTED HE WAS ANGRY
4422-23272-0033 SHE IMAGINED THAT WHAT HE SAID MIGHT BE CENSURE AND SHE CONTINUED TO TREMBLE THOUGH HE REPEATEDLY ASSURED HER THAT HE MEANT ONLY TO ADVISE NOT UPBRAID HER FOR AS TO ALL THOSE LITTLE DISPUTES BETWEEN MISTER SANDFORD AND YOU SAID HE
4422-23272-0034 I SHOULD BE PARTIAL IF I BLAMED YOU MORE THAN HIM INDEED WHEN YOU TAKE THE LIBERTY TO CONDEMN HIM HIS CHARACTER MAKES THE FREEDOM APPEAR IN A MORE SERIOUS LIGHT THAN WHEN HE COMPLAINS OF YOU
4422-23272-0035 BUT I HAVE A QUESTION TO ASK YOU AND TO WHICH I REQUIRE A SERIOUS AND UNEQUIVOCAL ANSWER DO YOU EXPECT LORD FREDERICK IN THE COUNTRY WITHOUT HESITATION SHE REPLIED I DO ONE MORE QUESTION I HAVE TO ASK MADAM
4422-23272-0036 IS LORD FREDERICK THE MAN YOU APPROVE FOR YOUR HUSBAND UPON THIS CLOSE INTERROGATION SHE DISCOVERED AN EMBARRASSMENT BEYOND ANY SHE HAD EVER YET BETRAYED AND FAINTLY REPLIED NO HE IS NOT
4422-23272-0037 WHICH AM I TO BELIEVE WHICH YOU PLEASE WAS HER ANSWER WHILE SHE DISCOVERED AN INSULTED DIGNITY
4422-23272-0038 BUT THEN WHY ENCOURAGE HIM TO FOLLOW YOU HITHER MISS MILNER WHY COMMIT A THOUSAND FOLLIES SHE REPLIED IN TEARS EVERY HOUR OF MY LIFE YOU THEN PROMOTE THE HOPES OF LORD FREDERICK WITHOUT ONE SERIOUS INTENTION OF COMPLETING THEM
4422-23272-0039 THIS IS A CONDUCT AGAINST WHICH IT IS MY DUTY TO GUARD YOU AND YOU SHALL NO LONGER DECEIVE EITHER HIM OR YOURSELF
4422-23272-0040 OR CONSENT TO BECOME HIS WIFE IN ANSWER TO THE ALTERNATIVE THUS OFFERED SHE APPEARED AVERSE TO BOTH PROPOSITIONS AND YET CAME TO NO EXPLANATION WHY BUT LEFT HER GUARDIAN AT THE END OF THE CONFERENCE
4422-23272-0041 AS MUCH AT A LOSS TO DECIDE UPON HER TRUE SENTIMENTS AS HE WAS BEFORE
