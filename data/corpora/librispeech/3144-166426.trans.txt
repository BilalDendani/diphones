3144-166426-0000 UP TOWARD US THE GATHERING MISTS HAD BEEN STEADILY RISING STILL WAS THEIR WAVERING CREST A HALF SCORE FEET BELOW US ABRUPTLY OUT OF THEIR DIM NEBULOSITY A FAINTLY PHOSPHORESCENT SQUARE BROKE IT LIFTED SLOWLY
3144-166426-0001 THEN SWEPT A DULLY LUSTROUS SIX FOOT CUBE UP THE SLOPE AND CAME TO REST ALMOST AT OUR FEET IT DWELT THERE CONTEMPLATED US FROM ITS MYRIADS OF DEEP SET SPARKLING STRIATIONS
3144-166426-0002 IN ITS WAKE SWAM ONE BY ONE SIX OTHERS THEIR TOPS RAISING FROM THE VAPORS LIKE THE FIRST WATCHFULLY LIKE SHIMMERING BACKS OF SEA MONSTERS LIKE TURRETS OF FANTASTIC ANGLED SUBMARINES FROM PHOSPHORESCENT SEAS
3144-166426-0003 BACK FROM THEM A PACE TEN PACES TWENTY WE RETREATED THEY LAY IMMOBILE STARING AT US CLEAVING THE MISTS SILK OF COPPER HAIR STREAMING WIDE UNEARTHLY EYES LAMBENT
3144-166426-0004 FLOATED UP BEHIND THEM NORHALA FOR AN INSTANT SHE WAS HIDDEN BEHIND THEIR BULK SUDDENLY WAS UPON THEM DRIFTED OVER THEM LIKE SOME SPIRIT OF LIGHT STOOD BEFORE US HER VEILS WERE AGAIN ABOUT HER GOLDEN GIRDLE
3144-166426-0005 SANDALS OF GOLD AND TURQUOISE IN THEIR PLACES PEARL WHITE HER BODY GLEAMED NO MARK OF LIGHTNING MARRED IT SHE WALKED TOWARD US TURNED AND FACED THE WATCHING CUBES SHE UTTERED NO SOUND
3144-166426-0006 BUT AS AT A SIGNAL THE CENTRAL CUBE SLID FORWARD HALTED BEFORE HER SHE RESTED A HAND UPON ITS EDGE RIDE WITH ME SHE SAID TO RUTH NORHALA VENTNOR TOOK A STEP FORWARD
3144-166426-0007 NORHALA WE MUST GO WITH HER AND THIS HE POINTED TO THE PONY MUST GO WITH US I MEANT YOU TO COME THE FARAWAY VOICE CHIMED BUT I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF
3144-166426-0008 THAT A MOMENT SHE CONSIDERED THEN TURNED TO THE SIX WAITING CUBES AGAIN AS AT A COMMAND FOUR OF THE THINGS MOVED SWIRLED IN TOWARD EACH OTHER WITH A WEIRD PRECISION WITH A MONSTROUS MARTIAL MIMICRY
3144-166426-0009 JOINED STOOD BEFORE US A PLATFORM TWELVE FEET SQUARE SIX HIGH MOUNT SIGHED NORHALA VENTNOR LOOKED HELPLESSLY AT THE SHEER FRONT FACING HIM MOUNT
3144-166426-0010 THERE WAS HALF WONDERING IMPATIENCE IN HER COMMAND SEE SHE CAUGHT RUTH BY THE WAIST AND WITH THE SAME BEWILDERING SWIFTNESS WITH WHICH SHE HAD VANISHED FROM US WHEN THE AURORA BECKONED SHE STOOD HOLDING THE GIRL UPON THE TOP OF THE SINGLE CUBE
3144-166426-0011 HAD BEEN LEVITATED WITH AN INCREDIBLE RAPIDITY MOUNT SHE MURMURED AGAIN LOOKING DOWN UPON US SLOWLY VENTNOR BEGAN TO BANDAGE THE PONY'S EYES I PLACED MY HAND UPON THE EDGE OF THE QUADRUPLE SPRANG A MYRIAD UNSEEN HANDS CAUGHT ME
3144-166426-0012 RAISED ME SET ME INSTANTANEOUSLY ON THE UPWARD SURFACE LIFT THE PONY TO ME I CALLED TO VENTNOR LIFT IT HE ECHOED INCREDULOUSLY DRAKE'S GRIN CUT LIKE A SUNRAY THROUGH THE NIGHTMARE DREAD THAT SHROUDED MY MIND
3144-166426-0013 CATCH HE CALLED PLACED ONE HAND BENEATH THE BEAST'S BELLY THE OTHER UNDER ITS THROAT HIS SHOULDERS HEAVED AND UP SHOT THE PONY LADEN AS IT WAS LANDED SOFTLY UPON FOUR WIDE STRETCHED LEGS BESIDE ME
3144-166426-0014 THE FACES OF THE TWO GAPED UP LUDICROUS IN THEIR AMAZEMENT FOLLOW CRIED NORHALA VENTNOR LEAPED WILDLY FOR THE TOP DRAKE BESIDE HIM IN THE FLASH OF A HUMMING BIRD'S WING THEY WERE GRIPPING ME
3144-166426-0015 SWEARING FEEBLY THE UNSEEN HOLD ANGLED STRUCK UPWARD CLUTCHED FROM ANKLE TO THIGH HELD US FAST MEN AND BEAST AWAY SWEPT THE BLOCK THAT BORE RUTH AND NORHALA
3144-166426-0016 HEAD BENT HER ARMS AROUND THE KNEES OF THE WOMAN THEY SLIPPED INTO THE MISTS VANISHED AND AFTER THEM LIKE A LOG IN A RACING CURRENT WE TOO DIPPED BENEATH THE FAINTLY LUMINOUS VAPORS
3144-166426-0017 THE CUBES MOVED WITH AN ENTIRE ABSENCE OF VIBRATION SO SMOOTHLY AND SKIMMINGLY INDEED
3144-166426-0018 AND THAT NOW BEAT STEADILY UPON OUR FACES AND THE CLOUDY WALLS STREAMING BY I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OURSELVES AT REST I SAW THE BLURRED FORM OF VENTNOR DRIFT TOWARD THE FORWARD EDGE HE WALKED AS THOUGH WADING I ESSAYED TO FOLLOW HIM
3144-166426-0019 MY FEET I COULD NOT LIFT I COULD ADVANCE ONLY BY GLIDING THEM AS THOUGH SKATING ALSO THE FORCE WHATEVER IT WAS THAT HELD ME SEEMED TO PASS ME ON FROM UNSEEN CLUTCH TO CLUTCH
3144-166426-0020 IT WAS AS THOUGH UP TO MY HIPS I MOVED THROUGH A CLOSELY WOVEN YET FLUID MASS OF COBWEBS I HAD THE FANTASTIC IDEA THAT IF I SO WILLED I COULD SLIP OVER THE EDGE OF THE BLOCKS CRAWL ABOUT THEIR SIDES WITHOUT FALLING
3144-166426-0021 HIS FACE DRAWN WITH ANXIETY HIS EYES FEVERISH CAN YOU SEE THEM WALTER HIS VOICE SHOOK GOD WHY DID I EVER LET HER GO LIKE THAT WHY DID I LET HER GO ALONE THEY'LL BE CLOSE AHEAD MARTIN

3144-166426-0023 NEW HOPE SOFTENED THE HAGGARD FACE THAT'S TRUE BUT IS IT WE'RE RECKONING WITH CREATURES THAT MAN'S IMAGINATION NEVER CONCEIVED NOR COULD CONCEIVE AND WITH THIS WOMAN HUMAN IN SHAPE YES BUT HUMAN IN THOUGHT NEVER
3144-166426-0024 HOW THEN CAN WE TELL HE TURNED ONCE MORE ALL HIS CONSCIOUSNESS CONCENTRATED IN HIS SEARCHING EYES DRAKE'S RIFLE SLIPPED FROM HIS HAND HE STOOPED TO PICK IT UP THEN TUGGED WITH BOTH HANDS THE RIFLE LAY IMMOVABLE
3144-166426-0025 I BENT AND STROVE TO AID HIM FOR ALL THE PAIR OF US COULD DO THE RIFLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A PART OF THE GLEAMING SURFACE ON WHICH IT RESTED THE TINY DEEPSET STAR POINTS WINKED UP THEY'RE LAUGHING AT US GRUNTED DRAKE
3144-166426-0026 AS I SAW IT SHAKE HIM NONSENSE THESE BLOCKS ARE GREAT MAGNETS THAT'S WHAT HOLDS THE RIFLE WHAT HOLDS US TOO I DON'T MEAN THE RIFLE HE SAID I MEAN THOSE POINTS OF LIGHTS THE EYES
3144-166426-0027 RED GOLD TRESSES STEAMING AND CLOSE BESIDE HER
3144-166426-0028 A MILE AWAY WAS AN OPENING IN THE VALLEY'S MOUNTAINOUS WALL TOWARD IT WE WERE SPEEDING IT WAS NO RAGGED CREVICE NO NATURE SPLIT FISSURE IT GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF A GIGANTIC DOORWAY LOOK WHISPERED DRAKE
3144-166426-0029 BETWEEN US AND THE VAST GATEWAY GLEAMING TRIANGLES BEGAN TO BREAK THROUGH THE VAPORS LIKE THE CUTTING FINS OF SHARKS GLINTS OF ROUND BODIES LIKE GIGANTIC PORPOISES THE VAPORS SEETHED WITH THEM
3144-166426-0030 THE REGAL HEAD OF NORHALA SWEEPING OVER THEM THE DULL GLINT AND GLEAM OF THE METAL PARADOXES FLOWING IN ORDERED MOTION ALL ABOUT US THE TITANIC GATEWAY GLOWING BEFORE US WE WERE AT ITS THRESHOLD
