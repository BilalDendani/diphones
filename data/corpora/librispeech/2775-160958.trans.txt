2775-160958-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME
2775-160958-0001 WHO HAD THREE DAUGHTERS THEY LIVED IN A VERY FINE HOUSE IN A BEAUTIFUL CITY AND HAD MANY SERVANTS IN GRAND LIVERIES TO WAIT UPON THEM ALL THEIR FOOD WAS SERVED ON GOLD AND SILVER DISHES
2775-160958-0002 THE TWO ELDEST WERE CALLED MARIGOLD AND DRESSALINDA NEVER A DAY PASSED BUT THESE TWO WENT OUT TO SOME FEAST OR JUNKETING BUT BEAUTY THE YOUNGEST LOVED TO STAY AT HOME AND KEEP HER OLD FATHER COMPANY NOW
2775-160958-0003 IT HAPPENED THAT MISFORTUNE CAME UPON THE MERCHANT SHIPS OF HIS WHICH WERE SAILING THE HIGH SEAS LADEN WITH MERCHANDISE OF GREAT PRICE WERE WRECKED AND IN ONE DAY HE FOUND THAT HE WAS NO LONGER THE RICHEST MERCHANT IN THE CITY BUT A VERY POOR MAN
2775-160958-0004 THERE WAS STILL LEFT TO HIM A LITTLE HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY AND TO THIS WHEN EVERYTHING ELSE HAD BEEN SOLD HE RETIRED HIS THREE DAUGHTERS OF COURSE WENT WITH HIM MARIGOLD AND DRESSALINDA WERE VERY CROSS TO THINK THAT THEY HAD LOST ALL THEIR MONEY
2775-160958-0005 AND AFTER BEING SO RICH AND SOUGHT AFTER THEY MUST NOW LIVE IN A MISERABLE COTTAGE BUT BEAUTY'S ONLY THOUGHT WAS TO CHEER HER OLD FATHER AND WHILE HER TWO SISTERS SAT ON WOODEN CHAIRS AND CRIED AND BEWAILED THEMSELVES
2775-160958-0006 BEAUTY LIGHTED THE FIRE AND GOT THE SUPPER READY FOR THE MERCHANT WAS NOW SO POOR THAT HE COULD NOT EVEN KEEP A SERVANT
2775-160958-0007 THE TWO ELDEST SISTERS WOULD DO NOTHING BUT SULK IN CORNERS WHILE BEAUTY SWEPT THE FLOORS AND WASHED THE DISHES AND DID HER BEST TO MAKE THE POOR COTTAGE PLEASANT THEY LED THEIR SISTER A DREADFUL LIFE TOO WITH THEIR COMPLAINTS FOR NOT ONLY DID THEY REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING THEMSELVES
2775-160958-0008 BUT THEY SAID THAT EVERYTHING SHE DID WAS DONE WRONG BUT BEAUTY BORE ALL THEIR UNKINDNESS PATIENTLY FOR HER FATHER'S SAKE IN THIS WAY A WHOLE YEAR WENT BY AND THEN ONE DAY A LETTER CAME FOR THE MERCHANT
2775-160958-0009 HE HASTENED TO FIND HIS DAUGHTERS FOR HE WAS ANXIOUS TO TELL THEM THE GOOD NEWS CONTAINED IN THE LETTER MY DEAR CHILDREN HE SAID AT LAST OUR LUCK HAS TURNED
2775-160958-0010 WE SHALL NOT BE SO RICH AS BEFORE BUT WE SHALL HAVE ENOUGH TO KEEP US IN COMFORT GET ME MY TRAVELING CLOAK BEAUTY I WILL SET OUT AT ONCE TO CLAIM MY SHIP AND NOW TELL ME GIRLS WHAT SHALL I BRING YOU WHEN I COME BACK A HUNDRED POUNDS SAID MARIGOLD WITHOUT HESITATING AN INSTANT

2775-160958-0012 OH BRING ME A ROSE SAID BEAUTY HASTILY HER FATHER KISSED HER FONDLY AND SET OUT YOU SILLY GIRL SAID MARIGOLD YOU JUST WANT OUR FATHER TO THINK YOU ARE MORE UNSELFISH THAN WE ARE THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT A ROSE INDEED
2775-160958-0013 INDEED SISTER SAID BEAUTY THAT WAS NOT THE REASON I THOUGHT OUR FATHER WOULD HAVE ENOUGH TO DO IN SEEING TO THE SAFETY OF HIS SHIP WITHOUT BEING TROUBLED TO DO SHOPPING FOR ME BUT THE SISTERS WERE VERY MUCH OFFENDED
2775-160958-0014 IN THE MEANTIME THE MERCHANT WENT HIS WAY TO THE CITY FULL OF HOPE AND GREAT PLANS AS TO WHAT HE WOULD DO WITH HIS MONEY BUT WHEN HE GOT THERE HE FOUND THAT SOME ONE HAD PLAYED A TRICK ON HIM AND NO SHIP OF HIS HAD COME INTO HARBOR SO HE WAS JUST AS BADLY OFF AS BEFORE
2775-160958-0015 HE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY LOOKING ABOUT TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS NO TRUTH IN THE LETTER HE HAD RECEIVED AND IT WAS BEGINNING TO GET DUSK WHEN HE STARTED OUT WITH A SAD HEART TO MAKE THE JOURNEY HOME AGAIN HE WAS TIRED AND MISERABLE AND HE HAD TASTED NO FOOD SINCE HE LEFT HOME IN THE MORNING
2775-160958-0016 IT WAS QUITE DARK BY THE TIME HE CAME TO THE GREAT WOOD THROUGH WHICH HE HAD TO PASS TO GET TO HIS COTTAGE AND WHEN HE SAW A LIGHT SHINING THROUGH THE TREES HE DECIDED NOT TO GO TO HIS HOME THAT NIGHT
2775-160958-0017 HE EXPECTED TO FIND A WOODCUTTER'S COTTAGE
2775-160958-0018 HE KNOCKED AT THE GATES BUT NO ONE ANSWERED AND PRESENTLY DRIVEN BY HUNGER AND COLD HE MADE BOLD TO ENTER AND MOUNTED THE MARBLE STEPS INTO THE GREAT HALL ALL THE WAY HE NEVER SAW A SOUL THERE WAS A BIG FIRE IN THE HALL
2775-160958-0019 AND WHEN HE HAD WARMED HIMSELF HE SET OUT TO LOOK FOR THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE BUT HE DID NOT LOOK FAR FOR BEHIND THE FIRST DOOR HE OPENED WAS A COSY LITTLE ROOM WITH SUPPER SET FOR ONE A SUPPER THE MERE LOOK OF WHICH MADE YOU HUNGRY
2775-160958-0020 SO THE MERCHANT SAT DOWN AS BOLD AS YOU PLEASE AND MADE A VERY HEARTY SUPPER AFTER WHICH HE AGAIN THOUGHT HE WOULD LOOK FOR THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE HE STARTED OFF AND OPENED ANOTHER DOOR BUT THERE HE SAW A BED MERELY TO LOOK AT WHICH MADE YOU SLEEPY
2775-160958-0021 THIS IS SOME FAIRIES WORK I HAD BETTER NOT LOOK ANY FARTHER FOR THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE AND WITH THAT HE TUMBLED INTO BED AND BEING VERY TIRED HE WENT TO SLEEP AT ONCE AND SLEPT LIKE A TOP TILL IT WAS TIME TO GET UP IN THE MORNING
2775-160958-0022 WHEN HE AWOKE HE WAS QUITE SURPRISED TO FIND HIMSELF IN SUCH A SOFT AND COMFORTABLE BED BUT PRESENTLY HE REMEMBERED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM I MUST BE GOING HE SAID TO HIMSELF BUT I WISH I COULD THANK MY HOST FOR MY GOOD REST AND MY GOOD SUPPER
2775-160958-0023 WHEN HE GOT OUT OF BED HE FOUND HE HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO BE GRATEFUL FOR FOR ON THE CHAIR BY THE BEDSIDE LAY A FINE SUIT OF NEW CLOTHES MARKED WITH HIS NAME AND WITH TEN GOLD PIECES IN EVERY POCKET
2775-160958-0024 HE FELT QUITE A DIFFERENT MAN WHEN HE HAD PUT ON THE SUIT OF BLUE AND SILVER AND JINGLED THE GOLD PIECES OF MONEY IN HIS POCKETS
2775-160958-0025 DOWN THE MARBLE STEPS HE WENT AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE GARDEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS FULL OF ROSES RED AND WHITE AND PINK AND YELLOW AND THE MERCHANT LOOKED AT THEM AND REMEMBERED BEAUTY'S WISH OH MY POOR DAUGHTERS HE SAID
2775-160958-0026 BUT BEAUTY AT ANY RATE CAN HAVE WHAT SHE WANTED SO HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND PLUCKED THE BIGGEST RED ROSE WITHIN HIS REACH AS THE STALK SNAPPED IN HIS FINGERS HE STARTED BACK IN TERROR FOR HE HEARD AN ANGRY ROAR
2775-160958-0027 AND THE NEXT MINUTE A DREADFUL BEAST SPRANG UPON HIM IT WAS TALLER THAN ANY MAN AND UGLIER THAN ANY ANIMAL BUT WHAT SEEMED MOST DREADFUL OF ALL TO THE MERCHANT IT SPOKE TO HIM WITH A MAN'S VOICE AFTER IT HAD ROARED AT HIM WITH THE BEAST'S
2775-160958-0028 UNGRATEFUL WRETCH SAID THE BEAST HAVE I NOT FED YOU LODGED YOU AND CLOTHED YOU AND NOW YOU MUST REPAY MY HOSPITALITY BY STEALING THE ONLY THING I CARE FOR MY ROSES MERCY MERCY CRIED THE MERCHANT
2775-160958-0029 NO SAID THE BEAST YOU MUST DIE THE POOR MERCHANT FELL UPON HIS KNEES AND TRIED TO THINK OF SOMETHING TO SAY TO SOFTEN THE HEART OF THE CRUEL BEAST AND AT LAST HE SAID SIR I ONLY STOLE THIS ROSE BECAUSE MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER ASKED ME TO BRING HER ONE
2775-160958-0030 I DID NOT THINK AFTER ALL YOU HAVE GIVEN ME THAT YOU WOULD GRUDGE ME A FLOWER TELL ME ABOUT THIS DAUGHTER OF YOURS SAID THE BEAST SUDDENLY IS SHE A GOOD GIRL THE BEST AND DEAREST IN THE WORLD SAID THE OLD MERCHANT AND THEN HE BEGAN TO WEEP
2775-160958-0031 TO THINK THAT HE MUST DIE AND LEAVE HIS BEAUTY ALONE IN THE WORLD WITH NO ONE TO BE KIND TO HER OH HE CRIED WHAT WILL MY POOR CHILDREN DO WITHOUT ME YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE YOU STOLE THE ROSE SAID THE BEAST
2775-160958-0032 HOWEVER IF ONE OF YOUR DAUGHTERS LOVES YOU WELL ENOUGH TO SUFFER INSTEAD OF YOU SHE MAY GO BACK AND TELL THEM WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU BUT YOU MUST GIVE ME YOUR PROMISE THAT EITHER YOU OR ONE OF YOUR DAUGHTERS SHALL BE AT MY PALACE DOOR IN THREE MONTHS TIME FROM TO DAY THE WRETCHED MAN PROMISED
2775-160958-0033 AT ANY RATE HE THOUGHT I SHALL HAVE THREE MONTHS MORE OF LIFE THEN THE BEAST SAID I WILL NOT LET YOU GO EMPTY HANDED SO THE MERCHANT FOLLOWED HIM BACK INTO THE PALACE THERE ON THE FLOOR OF THE HALL LAY A GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL CHEST OF WROUGHT SILVER
2775-160958-0034 FILL THIS WITH ANY TREASURES THAT TAKE YOUR FANCY SAID THE BEAST AND THE MERCHANT FILLED IT UP WITH PRECIOUS THINGS FROM THE BEAST'S TREASURE HOUSE I WILL SEND IT HOME FOR YOU SAID THE BEAST SHUTTING DOWN THE LID AND SO WITH A HEAVY HEART THE MERCHANT WENT AWAY
2775-160958-0035 BUT AS HE WENT THROUGH THE PALACE GATE THE BEAST CALLED TO HIM THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN BEAUTY'S ROSE AND AT THE SAME TIME HELD OUT TO HIM A LARGE BUNCH OF THE VERY BEST THE MERCHANT PUT THESE INTO BEAUTY'S HAND WHEN SHE RAN TO MEET HIM AT THE DOOR OF THEIR COTTAGE
2775-160958-0036 TAKE THEM MY CHILD HE SAID AND CHERISH THEM FOR THEY HAVE COST YOUR POOR FATHER HIS LIFE AND WITH THAT HE SAT DOWN AND TOLD THEM THE WHOLE STORY THE TWO ELDER SISTERS WEPT AND WAILED AND OF COURSE BLAMED BEAUTY FOR ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED
2775-160958-0037 BUT YOUR FOOLISHNESS HAS COST HIM HIS LIFE NO SAID BEAUTY IT IS MY LIFE THAT SHALL BE SACRIFICED FOR WHEN THE THREE MONTHS ARE OVER I SHALL GO TO THE BEAST AND HE MAY KILL ME IF HE WILL BUT HE SHALL NEVER HURT MY DEAR FATHER THE FATHER TRIED HARD TO PERSUADE HER NOT TO GO
2775-160958-0038 KNOCKED AND RANG IN VAIN AT THE GREAT GATE WARMED HIMSELF AT THE FIRE IN THE BIG HALL
2775-160958-0039 ONLY THIS TIME THE TABLE WAS LAID FOR TWO COME FATHER DEAR SAID BEAUTY TAKE COMFORT I DO NOT THINK THE BEAST MEANS TO KILL ME OR SURELY HE WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH A GOOD SUPPER BUT THE NEXT MOMENT THE BEAST CAME INTO THE ROOM
2775-160958-0040 BEAUTY SCREAMED AND CLUNG TO HER FATHER DON'T BE FRIGHTENED SAID THE BEAST GENTLY BUT TELL ME DO YOU COME HERE OF YOUR OWN FREE WILL YES SAID BEAUTY TREMBLING YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL SAID THE BEAST AND THEN TURNING TO THE OLD MAN
2775-160958-0041 HE TOLD HIM THAT HE MIGHT SLEEP THERE FOR THAT NIGHT BUT IN THE MORNING HE MUST GO AND LEAVE HIS DAUGHTER BEHIND HIM THEY WENT TO BED AND SLEPT SOUNDLY AND THE NEXT MORNING THE FATHER DEPARTED WEEPING BITTERLY BEAUTY LEFT ALONE TRIED NOT TO FEEL FRIGHTENED
2775-160958-0042 SHE RAN HERE AND THERE THROUGH THE PALACE AND FOUND IT MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANYTHING SHE HAD EVER IMAGINED THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SET OF ROOMS IN THE PALACE HAD WRITTEN OVER THE DOORS BEAUTY'S ROOMS AND IN THEM SHE FOUND BOOKS AND MUSIC CANARY BIRDS AND PERSIAN CATS
2775-160958-0043 AND EVERYTHING THAT COULD BE THOUGHT OF TO MAKE THE TIME PASS PLEASANTLY OH DEAR SHE SAID IF ONLY I COULD SEE MY POOR FATHER I SHOULD BE ALMOST HAPPY AS SHE SPOKE SHE HAPPENED TO LOOK AT A BIG MIRROR AND IN IT SHE SAW THE FORM OF HER FATHER REFLECTED
2775-160958-0044 JUST RIDING UP TO THE DOOR OF HIS COTTAGE THAT NIGHT WHEN BEAUTY SAT DOWN TO SUPPER THE BEAST CAME IN MAY I HAVE SUPPER WITH YOU SAID HE THAT MUST BE AS YOU PLEASE SAID BEAUTY
2775-160958-0045 SO THE BEAST SAT DOWN TO SUPPER WITH HER AND WHEN IT WAS FINISHED HE SAID I AM VERY UGLY BEAUTY AND I AM VERY STUPID BUT I LOVE YOU WILL YOU MARRY ME NO BEAST SAID BEAUTY GENTLY THE POOR BEAST SIGHED AND WENT AWAY
2775-160958-0046 AND EVERY NIGHT THE SAME THING HAPPENED HE ATE HIS SUPPER WITH HER AND THEN ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD MARRY HIM AND SHE ALWAYS SAID NO BEAST ALL THIS TIME SHE WAS WAITED ON BY INVISIBLE HANDS AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN A QUEEN
2775-160958-0047 BUT THE MAGIC LOOKING GLASS WAS BEST OF ALL FOR IN IT SHE COULD SEE WHATEVER SHE WISHED AS THE DAYS WENT BY AND HER SLIGHTEST WISH WAS GRANTED ALMOST BEFORE SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WANTED SHE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THE BEAST MUST LOVE HER VERY DEARLY
2775-160958-0048 AND SHE WAS VERY SORRY TO SEE HOW SAD HE LOOKED EVERY NIGHT WHEN SHE SAID NO TO HIS OFFER OF MARRIAGE ONE DAY SHE SAW IN HER MIRROR THAT HER FATHER WAS ILL SO THAT NIGHT SHE SAID TO THE BEAST
2775-160958-0049 HE IS ILL AND HE THINKS THAT I AM DEAD DO LET ME GO AND CHEER HIM UP AND I WILL PROMISE FAITHFULLY TO RETURN TO YOU VERY WELL SAID THE BEAST KINDLY BUT DON'T STAY AWAY MORE THAN A WEEK FOR IF YOU DO I SHALL DIE OF GRIEF BECAUSE I LOVE YOU SO DEARLY
2775-160958-0050 HOW SHALL I REACH HOME SAID BEAUTY I DO NOT KNOW THE WAY THEN THE BEAST GAVE HER A RING AND TOLD HER TO PUT IT ON HER FINGER WHEN SHE WENT TO BED TURN THE RUBY TOWARDS THE PALM OF HER HAND AND THEN SHE WOULD WAKE UP IN HER FATHER'S COTTAGE
2775-160958-0051 WHEN SHE WANTED TO COME BACK SHE WAS TO DO THE SAME THING SO IN THE MORNING WHEN SHE AWOKE SHE FOUND HERSELF AT HER FATHER'S HOUSE AND THE OLD MAN WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH JOY TO SEE HER SAFE AND SOUND BUT HER SISTERS DID NOT WELCOME HER VERY KINDLY
2775-160958-0052 I WISH WE HAD GONE SAID MARIGOLD BEAUTY ALWAYS GETS THE BEST OF EVERYTHING TELL US ALL ABOUT YOUR GRAND PALACE SAID DRESSALINDA AND WHAT YOU DO AND HOW YOU SPEND YOUR TIME SO BEAUTY THINKING IT WOULD AMUSE THEM TO HEAR
2775-160958-0053 TOLD THEM AND THEIR ENVY INCREASED DAY BY DAY AT LAST DRESSALINDA SAID TO MARIGOLD
2775-160958-0054 IF WE COULD ONLY MAKE HER FORGET THE DAY THE BEAST MIGHT BE ANGRY AND KILL HER AND THEN THERE WOULD BE A CHANCE FOR US SO ON THE DAY BEFORE SHE OUGHT TO HAVE GONE BACK THEY PUT SOME POPPY JUICE IN A CUP OF WINE WHICH THEY GAVE HER
2775-160958-0055 AND THIS MADE HER SO SLEEPY THAT SHE SLEPT FOR TWO WHOLE DAYS AND NIGHTS AT THE END OF THAT TIME HER SLEEP GREW TROUBLED AND SHE DREAMED THAT SHE SAW THE BEAST LYING DEAD AMONG THE ROSES IN THE BEAUTIFUL GARDENS OF HIS PALACE AND FROM THIS DREAM SHE AWOKE CRYING BITTERLY
2775-160958-0056 ALTHOUGH SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT A WEEK AND TWO DAYS HAD GONE BY SINCE SHE LEFT THE BEAST YET AFTER THAT DREAM SHE AT ONCE TURNED THE RUBY TOWARDS HER PALM
2775-160958-0057 SHE DID NOT KNOW WHERE HIS ROOMS IN THE PALACE WERE BUT SHE FELT SHE COULD NOT WAIT TILL SUPPER TIME BEFORE SEEING HIM SO SHE RAN HITHER AND THITHER CALLING HIS NAME
2775-160958-0058 THEN SHE RAN THROUGH THE GARDENS CALLING HIS NAME AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT STILL THERE WAS SILENCE OH WHAT SHALL I DO IF I CANNOT FIND HIM SHE SAID I SHALL NEVER BE HAPPY AGAIN
2775-160958-0059 THEN SHE REMEMBERED HER DREAM AND RAN TO THE ROSE GARDEN AND THERE SURE ENOUGH BESIDE THE BASIN OF THE BIG FOUNTAIN LAY THE POOR BEAST WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF LIFE IN HIM BEAUTY FLUNG HERSELF ON HER KNEES BESIDE HIM
2775-160958-0060 OH DEAR BEAST SHE CRIED AND ARE YOU REALLY DEAD ALAS ALAS THEN I TOO WILL DIE FOR I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT YOU IMMEDIATELY THE BEAST OPENED HIS EYES SIGHED AND SAID
2775-160958-0061 BEAUTY WILL YOU MARRY ME AND BEAUTY BESIDE HERSELF WITH JOY WHEN SHE FOUND THAT HE WAS STILL ALIVE ANSWERED YES YES DEAR BEAST FOR I LOVE YOU DEARLY
2775-160958-0062 AND IN PLACE OF THE BEAST STOOD A HANDSOME PRINCE DRESSED IN A DOUBLET OF WHITE AND SILVER LIKE ONE MADE READY FOR A WEDDING HE KNELT AT BEAUTY'S FEET AND CLASPED HER HANDS DEAR BEAUTY HE SAID NOTHING BUT YOUR LOVE COULD HAVE DISENCHANTED ME
2775-160958-0063 A WICKED FAIRY TURNED ME INTO A BEAST AND CONDEMNED ME TO REMAIN ONE UNTIL SOME FAIR AND GOOD MAIDEN SHOULD LOVE ME WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY ME IN SPITE OF MY UGLINESS AND STUPIDITY NOW DEAR ONE THE ENCHANTMENT IS BROKEN LET US GO BACK TO MY PALACE
2775-160958-0064 WILL NOW BECOME VISIBLE SO THEY RETURNED TO THE PALACE WHICH BY THIS TIME WAS CROWDED WITH COURTIERS EAGER TO KISS THE HANDS OF THE PRINCE AND HIS BRIDE AND THE PRINCE WHISPERED TO ONE OF HIS ATTENDANTS WHO WENT OUT
2775-160958-0065 AND IN A VERY LITTLE TIME CAME BACK WITH BEAUTY'S FATHER AND SISTERS THE SISTERS WERE CONDEMNED TO BE CHANGED INTO STATUES AND TO STAND AT THE RIGHT AND LEFT OF THE PALACE GATES UNTIL THEIR HEARTS SHOULD BE SOFTENED AND THEY SHOULD BE SORRY FOR THEIR UNKINDNESS TO THEIR SISTER
2775-160958-0066 BUT BEAUTY HAPPILY MARRIED TO HER PRINCE WENT SECRETLY TO THE STATUES EVERY DAY AND WEPT OVER THEM AND BY HER TEARS THEIR STONY HEARTS WERE SOFTENED AND THEY WERE CHANGED INTO FLESH AND BLOOD AGAIN AND WERE GOOD AND KIND FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES
2775-160958-0067 AND BEAUTY AND THE BEAST WHO WAS A BEAST NO MORE BUT A HANDSOME PRINCE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER AND INDEED I BELIEVE THEY ARE LIVING HAPPILY STILL
