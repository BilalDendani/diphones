1092-134579-0000 WHEN I LEFT NEW YORK THE IDEA HAD BECOME A FIXED PURPOSE AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT I SHOULD GO TO CAMBRIDGE THIS WAS THE NEAREST APPROACH I COULD GET TO HARVARD AND TO THE FULFILLMENT OF MY CHILDISH DECLARATION
1092-134579-0001 AT THE CAMBRIDGE SCHOOL THE PLAN WAS TO HAVE MISS SULLIVAN ATTEND THE CLASSES WITH ME AND INTERPRET TO ME THE INSTRUCTION GIVEN OF COURSE MY INSTRUCTORS HAD HAD NO EXPERIENCE IN TEACHING ANY BUT NORMAL PUPILS AND MY ONLY MEANS OF CONVERSING WITH THEM
1092-134579-0002 WITH THE IDEA OF PREPARING FOR COLLEGE BUT I HAD BEEN WELL DRILLED IN ENGLISH BY MISS SULLIVAN
1092-134579-0003 I HAD HAD MOREOVER A GOOD START IN FRENCH AND RECEIVED SIX MONTHS INSTRUCTION IN LATIN BUT GERMAN WAS THE SUBJECT WITH WHICH I WAS MOST FAMILIAR IN SPITE HOWEVER OF THESE ADVANTAGES THERE WERE SERIOUS DRAWBACKS TO MY PROGRESS
1092-134579-0004 MISS SULLIVAN COULD NOT SPELL OUT IN MY HAND ALL THAT THE BOOKS REQUIRED
1092-134579-0005 ALTHOUGH MY FRIENDS IN LONDON AND PHILADELPHIA WERE WILLING TO HASTEN THE WORK FOR A WHILE INDEED I HAD TO COPY MY LATIN IN BRAILLE SO THAT I COULD RECITE WITH THE OTHER GIRLS
1092-134579-0006 TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS READILY AND CORRECT MISTAKES I COULD NOT MAKE NOTES IN CLASS OR WRITE EXERCISES BUT I WROTE ALL MY COMPOSITIONS AND TRANSLATIONS AT HOME ON MY TYPEWRITER
1092-134579-0007 EACH DAY MISS SULLIVAN WENT TO THE CLASSES WITH ME AND SPELLED INTO MY HAND WITH INFINITE PATIENCE ALL THAT THE TEACHERS SAID IN STUDY HOURS SHE HAD TO LOOK UP NEW WORDS FOR ME AND READ AND REREAD NOTES AND BOOKS I DID NOT HAVE IN RAISED PRINT
1092-134579-0008 HOW SLOW AND INADEQUATE HER SPELLING WAS
1092-134579-0009 IN SPECIAL LESSONS TWICE A WEEK TO GIVE MISS SULLIVAN A LITTLE REST BUT THOUGH EVERYBODY WAS KIND AND READY TO HELP US THERE WAS ONLY ONE HAND THAT COULD TURN DRUDGERY INTO PLEASURE THAT YEAR I FINISHED ARITHMETIC REVIEWED MY LATIN GRAMMAR
1092-134579-0010 AND READ THREE CHAPTERS OF CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR IN GERMAN I READ PARTLY WITH MY FINGERS AND PARTLY WITH MISS SULLIVAN'S ASSISTANCE SCHILLER'S LIED VON DER GLOCKE AND TAUCHER HEINE'S
1092-134579-0011 THE HISTORY OF FREDERICK THE GREAT'S MAGNIFICENT ACHIEVEMENTS AND THE ACCOUNT OF GOETHE'S LIFE I WAS SORRY TO FINISH
1092-134579-0012 AND CHARMING DESCRIPTIONS OF VINE CLAD HILLS STREAMS THAT SING AND RIPPLE IN THE SUNSHINE AND WILD REGIONS SACRED TO TRADITION AND LEGEND THE GRAY SISTERS OF A LONG VANISHED IMAGINATIVE AGE
1092-134579-0013 A FEELING A LOVE AND AN APPETITE MISTER GILMAN INSTRUCTED ME PART OF THE YEAR IN ENGLISH LITERATURE WE READ TOGETHER AS YOU LIKE IT BURKE'S SPEECH ON CONCILIATION WITH AMERICA AND MACAULAY'S LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON
1092-134579-0014 AND HIS CLEVER EXPLANATIONS MADE MY WORK EASIER AND PLEASANTER THAN IT COULD HAVE BEEN HAD I ONLY READ NOTES MECHANICALLY WITH THE NECESSARILY BRIEF EXPLANATIONS GIVEN IN THE CLASSES
1092-134579-0015 BURKE'S SPEECH WAS MORE INSTRUCTIVE THAN ANY OTHER BOOK ON A POLITICAL SUBJECT THAT I HAD EVER READ MY MIND STIRRED WITH THE STIRRING TIMES AND THE CHARACTERS ROUND WHICH THE LIFE OF TWO CONTENDING NATIONS CENTRED SEEMED TO MOVE RIGHT BEFORE ME
1092-134579-0016 I WONDERED MORE AND MORE
1092-134579-0017 HOW IT WAS THAT KING GEORGE AND HIS MINISTERS COULD HAVE TURNED A DEAF EAR TO HIS WARNING PROPHECY OF OUR VICTORY AND THEIR HUMILIATION THEN I ENTERED INTO THE MELANCHOLY DETAILS OF THE RELATION IN WHICH THE GREAT STATESMAN STOOD TO HIS PARTY
1092-134579-0018 AND TO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE I THOUGHT HOW STRANGE IT WAS THAT SUCH PRECIOUS SEEDS OF TRUTH AND WISDOM SHOULD HAVE FALLEN AMONG THE TARES OF IGNORANCE AND CORRUPTION IN A DIFFERENT WAY MACAULAY'S LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON
1092-134579-0019 WAS INTERESTING MY HEART WENT OUT TO THE LONELY MAN WHO ATE THE BREAD OF AFFLICTION IN GRUB STREET AND YET IN THE MIDST OF TOIL AND CRUEL SUFFERING OF BODY AND SOUL ALWAYS HAD A KIND WORD AND LENT A HELPING HAND TO THE POOR AND DESPISED
1092-134579-0020 I REJOICED OVER ALL HIS SUCCESSES I SHUT MY EYES TO HIS FAULTS AND WONDERED NOT THAT HE HAD THEM
1092-134579-0021 TO THE DEMOSTHENES OF GREAT BRITAIN AT THE CAMBRIDGE SCHOOL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I ENJOYED THE COMPANIONSHIP OF SEEING AND HEARING GIRLS OF MY OWN AGE I LIVED WITH SEVERAL OTHERS IN ONE OF THE PLEASANT HOUSES CONNECTED WITH THE SCHOOL THE HOUSE WHERE MISTER HOWELLS USED TO LIVE
1092-134579-0022 AND WE ALL HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF HOME LIFE I JOINED THEM IN MANY OF THEIR GAMES EVEN BLIND MAN'S BUFF AND FROLICS IN THE SNOW I TOOK LONG WALKS WITH THEM WE DISCUSSED OUR STUDIES AND READ ALOUD THE THINGS THAT INTERESTED US
1092-134579-0023 SO THAT MISS SULLIVAN DID NOT HAVE TO REPEAT THEIR CONVERSATION AT CHRISTMAS MY MOTHER AND LITTLE SISTER SPENT THE HOLIDAYS WITH ME AND MISTER GILMAN KINDLY OFFERED TO LET MILDRED STUDY IN HIS SCHOOL
1092-134579-0024 THE SUBJECTS I OFFERED WERE ELEMENTARY AND ADVANCED GERMAN FRENCH
1092-134579-0025 EACH CANDIDATE WAS KNOWN NOT BY HIS NAME BUT BY A NUMBER
1092-134579-0026 BUT AS I HAD TO USE A TYPEWRITER MY IDENTITY COULD NOT BE CONCEALED IT WAS THOUGHT ADVISABLE FOR ME TO HAVE MY EXAMINATIONS IN A ROOM BY MYSELF BECAUSE THE NOISE OF THE TYPEWRITER MIGHT DISTURB THE OTHER GIRLS
1092-134579-0027 WHILE I REPEATED THE WORDS ALOUD TO MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTOOD HIM PERFECTLY THE PAPERS WERE DIFFICULT AND I FELT VERY ANXIOUS AS I WROTE OUT MY ANSWERS ON THE TYPEWRITER MISTER GILMAN SPELLED TO ME WHAT I HAD WRITTEN
1092-134579-0028 AND HE INSERTED THEM I WISH TO SAY HERE THAT I HAVE NOT HAD THIS ADVANTAGE SINCE IN ANY OF MY EXAMINATIONS AT RADCLIFFE NO ONE READS THE PAPERS TO ME AFTER THEY ARE WRITTEN AND I HAVE NO OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT ERRORS UNLESS I FINISH BEFORE THE TIME IS UP
1092-134579-0029 IN THAT CASE I CORRECT ONLY SUCH MISTAKES AS I CAN RECALL IN THE FEW MINUTES ALLOWED AND MAKE NOTES OF THESE CORRECTIONS AT THE END OF MY PAPER IF I PASSED WITH HIGHER CREDIT IN THE PRELIMINARIES THAN IN THE FINALS THERE ARE TWO REASONS IN THE FINALS
1092-134579-0030 NO ONE READ MY WORK OVER TO ME AND IN THE PRELIMINARIES I OFFERED SUBJECTS WITH SOME OF WHICH I WAS IN A MEASURE FAMILIAR BEFORE MY WORK IN THE CAMBRIDGE SCHOOL
1092-134579-0031 WHICH MISTER GILMAN GAVE ME FROM PREVIOUS HARVARD PAPERS MISTER GILMAN SENT MY WRITTEN WORK TO THE EXAMINERS WITH A CERTIFICATE THAT I
1092-134579-0032 HAD WRITTEN THE PAPERS ALL THE OTHER PRELIMINARY EXAMINATIONS WERE CONDUCTED IN THE SAME MANNER NONE OF THEM WAS SO DIFFICULT AS THE FIRST
