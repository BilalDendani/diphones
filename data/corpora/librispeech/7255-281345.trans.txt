7255-281345-0000 ON THE TOP OF A PALM TREE IN AN OASIS OF THE ARABIAN DESERT SAT THE PHOENIX GLOWERING MOODILY UPON THE WORLD BELOW HE WAS ALONE QUITE ALONE
7255-281345-0001 IN HIS OLD AGE AS HE HAD BEEN ALONE IN HIS YOUTH AND IN HIS MIDDLE YEARS FOR THE PHOENIX HAS NEITHER MATE NOR CHILDREN AND THERE IS NEVER BUT ONE OF HIS KIND UPON THE EARTH
7255-281345-0002 ONCE HE HAD BEEN PROUD OF HIS SOLITARINESS AND OF HIS UNUSUAL BEAUTY WHICH CAUSED SUCH WONDER WHEN HE WENT ABROAD BUT NOW HE WAS OLD AND WEAK AND WEARY AND HE WAS LONELY
7255-281345-0003 OH SO LONELY HE HAD LIVED TOO LONG HE THOUGHT
7255-281345-0004 FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AFAR AND APART HE HAD WATCHED THE COMING AND GOING OF THINGS IN THE WORLD HE HAD SEEN THE OTHER BIRDS CREATED AND HAD WATCHED THEM UNDERGO STRANGE CHANGES IN FORM AND COLOR
7255-281345-0005 UNTIL THEY BECAME AS THEY ARE TO DAY
7255-281345-0006 HE HAD SEEN THE FLAMING HEART OF THE VOLCANO TAMED AND QUIETED UNTIL IT BECAME THE FLAMING LITTLE HUMMING BIRD HE HAD SEEN THE CROW TURN BLACK AND THE GOLDFINCH BECOME A GAUDY BIRD AND HE KNEW HOW AND WHY ALL THESE THINGS HAD COME TO PASS
7255-281345-0007 FOR CENTURIES HOW MANY HE KNEW NOT HE HAD WATCHED THE BIRDS HATCH OUT OF THEIR LITTLE EGGS
7255-281345-0008 AND FINALLY DIE AND DISAPPEAR AS BIRDS DO LEAVING NO TRACE BEHIND BUT THE PHOENIX DID NOT DIE HE WAS OF DIFFERENT CLAY FROM THESE ORDINARY FEATHERED CREATURES
7255-281345-0009 THE GOLD AND CRIMSON ONE WHO WHEN HE WENT ABROAD FILLED ALL CREATURES WITH AWE OF HIS BEAUTY AND WISDOM AND MYSTERY SO THAT THEY DARED NOT COME NEAR BUT FOLLOWED HIM AFAR OFF HUSHING THEIR SONG AND ADORING SILENTLY
7255-281345-0010 THE PHOENIX FED NOT ON FLOWERS OR FRUIT OR DISGUSTING INSECT FRY BUT ON PRECIOUS FRANKINCENSE AND MYRRH AND ODORIFEROUS GUMS AND THE SUN HIMSELF LOVED TO CARESS HIS PLUMAGE OF GOLD AND CRIMSON
7255-281345-0011 AS FOR MEN THEY ALSO HAD ADORED HIM IN TIME PAST AND HAD BUILT TEMPLES IN HIS HONOR
7255-281345-0012 THE PHOENIX HAD SEEN MANY GENERATIONS OF MEN GROW UP DO GOOD OR EVIL DEEDS AND DIE SOMETIMES LEAVING GRAND MONUMENTS UPON THE EARTH SOMETIMES DISAPPEARING FROM KNOWLEDGE LIKE THE VERY BIRDS LEAVING SCARCELY A TRACE BEHIND
7255-281345-0013 IN HIS TIME GREAT KINGS HAD LIVED AND REIGNED AND TURNED TO DUST
7255-281345-0014 POETS HAD SUNG AND HAD DIED SINGING BUT THE PHOENIX LOOKING DOWN FROM THE PALMS OF HIS DESERT SAW IT ALL AND DID NOT DIE ALL THIS HAD BEEN HIS PRIDE AND HONOR HOW HE HAD ENJOYED HIS STRENGTH HIS BEAUTY HIS WISDOM
7255-281345-0015 AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HE WAS HONORED AND ADORED BY THOUSANDS WHO HAD NEVER EVEN SEEN HIS GLORY BUT NOW NOW ALL WAS CHANGED HE WAS GROWN OLD AND TIRED HE FELT HIS LONELINESS AND HE LONGED TO DIE
7255-281345-0016 HIS WINGS WERE FEEBLE OF LATE HE HAD NOT DARED TO VENTURE FAR FROM THE DESERT HE DREADED THE CURIOUS GAZE OF THE OTHER BIRDS WHO WOULD FIND HIS BEAUTY DIMMED AND WOULD SCORN PERCHANCE THE FADED GLORY WHICH THEY HAD ONCE HELD IN AWE
7255-281345-0017 FOR YEARS HE HAD NOT VENTURED WITHIN SIGHT OF MEN AND HE KNEW THAT MOST OF THEM HAD FORGOTTEN HIS EXISTENCE NAY EVEN DENIED THAT HE HAD EVER LIVED HE FEARED THAT THERE MIGHT NOT BE A SINGLE HEART IN ALL THE WORLD THAT THRILLED TO HIS NAME
7255-281345-0018 THINKING THUS MOURNFULLY THE PHOENIX SAT UPON THE TOP OF THE TALLEST PALM HIS PLUMAGE OF CRIMSON AND GOLD GLOWED IN THE LAST RAYS OF THE SETTING SUN
7255-281345-0019 THE JOY OF LIFE WAS GONE SLOWLY THE SUN SANK TOWARDS THE HORIZON A RED EYE FIXED UPON THE PHOENIX STEADILY SUDDENLY ACROSS THE GRAY WASTE OF SAND DOTTED A BEAM OF LIGHT INTENSELY BRIGHT
7255-281345-0020 A SINGLE RAY FROM THAT WATCHFUL EYE SEEMED TO FLAME AS IT REACHED THE PALM TREE AND PIERCED TO THE VERY HEART OF THE PHOENIX A THRILL RAN THROUGH HIS BODY
7255-281345-0021 HE DREW HIMSELF TOGETHER AND HIS EYE GLEAMED WITH NEW LUSTRE AS HE FIXED IT STEADILY UPON THE DAZZLING DISK JUST TOUCHING THE HORIZON DARK STOOD THE PALM AGAINST THE DESERT
7255-281345-0022 BUT THE PHOENIX WAS BATHED IN SUDDEN LIGHT IT WAS THE SIGNAL THE SIGNAL FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN WAITING THOUGH HE KNEW IT NOT THE FIVE HUNDRED YEARS WERE ENDED THE MYSTERY OF HIS LIFE WAS ABOUT TO BE SOLVED
7255-281345-0023 AS THE SUN SANK BELOW THE HORIZON EAGERLY THE PHOENIX SET ABOUT THE TASK WHICH WAS BEFORE HIM AT LAST HE MIGHT BUILD THE NEST WHICH TILL NOW HE HAD NEVER KNOWN
7255-281345-0024 THAT IT MIGHT RECEIVE FROM THE BLESSED EAST THE FIRST BEAM OF THE MORNING SUN MARVELOUSLY STRENGTHENED FOR THE TASK BACK AND FORTH TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH HIS WINGS OF CRIMSON AND GOLD BORE THE PHOENIX THAT NIGHT
7255-281345-0025 FOR THIS WAS TO BE NO NEST OF STICKS AND STRAW OF PRECIOUS THINGS MUST IT BE MADE AND WELL HE KNEW WHERE SUCH WERE TO BE FOUND OF SILKY LEAVES AND GRASS INTERWOVEN WITH SPLINTERS OF SANDAL WOOD WERE THE WALLS
7255-281345-0026 THEN ON THE BOTTOM OF THE NEST HE LAID BIT BY BIT A PILE OF SWEET SMELLING GUMS
7255-281345-0027 AMBERGRIS AND FRANKINCENSE WITH NO MEANER CHOICE ALL NIGHT HE LABORED BEAK AND TALON UNTIL THE NEST WAS READY AND AS THE FIRST TINTS OF DAWN BEGAN TO STREAK THE EAST THE PHOENIX ROSE ONCE
7255-281345-0028 HIGH INTO THE AIR GAZING WITH WISTFUL EYES OVER THE WORLD WHICH HE HAD LOVED THEN SLOWLY SINKING TO THE PALM HE POISED HIS GORGEOUS BODY UPON THE FRAGRANT NEST
7255-281345-0029 WITH WINGS SPREAD WIDE AND EYES FIXED EAGERLY UPON THE SPOT WHERE THE SUN WAS SURE TO RISE HE WAITED WAITED AT LAST THE GOLDEN EYE APPEARED
7255-281345-0030 AS ON THE NIGHT BEFORE ONE RADIANT BEAM SEEMED TO SINGLE OUT THE LONELY PALM ONE SHAFT OF FLAME PIERCED TO THE NEST WHEREON THE PHOENIX SAT IT WAS THE FINAL SIGNAL TO THE BIRD OF THE SUN
7255-281345-0031 IMMEDIATELY THE GREAT BIRD BEGAN TO FAN THE SWEET SMELLING MASS WITH HIS WINGS THE BURNING RAY GREW BRIGHTER A PUNGENT WONDERFUL AROMA OF MINGLED FRAGRANCES FILLED THE AIR
7255-281345-0032 GRADUALLY THE SUN ROSE GREAT AND GLORIOUS AND AS IT ADVANCED INTO THE HEAVEN A THIN CLOUD OF SMOKE FLOATED FROM THE PALM TREE AND WOUND AWAY ACROSS THE DESERT TOWARDS THE EAST
7255-281345-0033 FASTER AND FASTER FANNED THE GREAT WINGS OF THE PHOENIX UNTIL WHEN THE SUN SHONE FULL DOWN THROUGH THE PALM TREE TOP
7255-281345-0034 IN THE MIDST OF WHICH THE PHOENIX BLENDED CRIMSON AND GOLD HIGH IN THE AIR ROSE THE FIRE DIFFUSING ABROAD ALL THE SWEET ODORS OF ARABY THE BLEST
7255-281345-0035 LOWER AND LOWER UNTIL BUT A PILE OF ASHES REMAINED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE NEST BUT LO WAS THE PHOENIX DEAD
7255-281345-0036 A BIRD LIKE THE EAGLE IN SHAPE BUT NOBLER LARGER STRONGER MORE GRACIOUS EVEN THAN THE KING OF BIRDS A BRILLIANT VISION OF CRIMSON AND GOLD ROSE LIKE A FLAME FROM THE NEST HUNG FOR A MOMENT ABOVE THE PALM
7255-281345-0037 LOOKING EAGERLY AT THE SUN WHICH BAPTIZED HIM IN ITS SPLENDOR A NEW PHOENIX LIVED IN THE WORLD ONCE MORE THE ANCIENT GLORY WAS RENEWED ONCE MORE YOUTH JOY AND HOPE SPRANG FROM THE PHOENIX'S ASHES
7255-281345-0038 AND REJOICED IN THE CENTURIES OF SUNSHINE BEFORE HIM DEATH WAS INDEED WORTH DYING TO MAKE THIS LIFE WORTH LIVING SLOWLY THE YOUNG PHOENIX DESCENDED TO THE NEST WHICH HAD BEEN AT ONCE A SEPULCHRE AND A CRADLE
7255-281345-0039 WITH LUSTY BEAK AND TALON HE TORE THE NEST BODILY FROM THE BRANCHES AND SET OUT UPON HIS PIOUS JOURNEY HE KNEW NOT WHERE HE WENT NOR WHY BUT THE SUN DREW HIM TO THE EAST
7255-281345-0040 AS HE SPED THROUGH THE SKY A FLASH OF GOLD AND CRIMSON THE LESSER BIRDS GATHERED TO WONDER AND ADMIRE FLOCKS OF THEM FOLLOWED AT A DISTANCE A TRAIN OF WORSHIPERS CHORUSING THE GLORY OF THE NEW BORN WONDER
7255-281345-0041 HE BORE HIS HEAD HIGH WITH ITS BURDEN AND HIS HEART WAS FILLED WITH PIOUS JOY IT WAS GOOD TO BE A PHOENIX GOOD GOOD AT LAST HE REACHED THE PLACE WHICH UNKNOWINGLY HE SOUGHT THE SUN ALONE HAD BEEN HIS GUIDE
7255-281345-0042 TO THE CITY OF HELIOPOLIS IN EGYPT HE CAME TO THE GREAT TEMPLE OF THE SUN BRIGHTLY ADORNED WITH CRIMSON AND GOLD THE PHOENIX COLORS THERE UPON THE ALTAR HE LAID THE PRECIOUS ASHES AND LO
7255-281345-0043 THERE WERE FOLK WAITING TO RECEIVE THEM MANY LITTLE CHILDREN AND SOME ELDERS OF CHILDLIKE HEART WHO TOOK THE ASHES AND LAID THEM REVERENTLY IN THE SHRINE THE PHOENIX WAS NOT FORGOTTEN HE WAS NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN SO LONG AS THE WORLD SHOULD LAST
