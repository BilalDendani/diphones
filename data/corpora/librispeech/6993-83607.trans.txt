6993-83607-0000 HE FEELS WITHIN HIM SOMETHING THAT TELLS HIM THEY ARE NOT OF HIS KIND AND YET NOT ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT FROM HIM HE SUMS THEM UP IN ONE WORD DRAWN FROM SENSUOUS EXPERIENCE DOES HE WISH TO EXPRESS STILL MORE FORCIBLY THIS SENTIMENT
6993-83607-0001 HE DOUBLES THE WORD OR PREFIXES AN ADJECTIVE OR ADDS AN AFFIX AS THE GENIUS OF HIS LANGUAGE MAY DICTATE BUT IT STILL REMAINS TO HIM BUT AN UNAPPLIED ABSTRACTION A MERE CATEGORY OF THOUGHT
6993-83607-0002 A FRAME FOR THE ALL IT IS NEVER THE OBJECT OF VENERATION OR SACRIFICE NO MYTH BRINGS IT DOWN TO HIS COMPREHENSION IT IS NOT INSTALLED IN HIS TEMPLES
6993-83607-0003 MAN CANNOT ESCAPE THE BELIEF THAT BEHIND ALL FORM IS ONE ESSENCE BUT THE MOMENT HE WOULD SEIZE AND DEFINE IT IT ELUDES HIS GRASP
6993-83607-0004 HE WORSHIPS NOT THE INFINITE HE THINKS BUT A BASE IDOL OF HIS OWN MAKING AS IN THE ZEND AVESTA BEHIND THE ETERNAL STRUGGLE OF ORMUZD AND AHRIMAN LOOMS UP THE UNDISTURBED AND INFINITE ZERUANA AKERANA
6993-83607-0005 AS IN THE PAGES OF THE GREEK POETS WE HERE AND THERE CATCH GLIMPSES OF A ZEUS WHO IS NOT HE THRONED ON OLYMPUS NOR HE WHO TAKES PART IN THE WRANGLES OF THE GODS BUT STANDS FAR OFF AND ALONE ONE YET ALL
6993-83607-0006 WHO WAS WHO IS WHO WILL BE SO THE BELIEF IN AN UNSEEN SPIRIT WHO ASKS NEITHER SUPPLICATION NOR SACRIFICE WHO AS THE NATIVES OF TEXAS TOLD JOUTEL IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY FOUR
6993-83607-0007 WAS DOUBTLESS OCCASIONALLY PRESENT TO THEIR MINDS IT WAS PRESENT NOT MORE BUT FAR LESS DISTINCTLY AND OFTEN NOT AT ALL IN THE MORE SAVAGE TRIBES AND NO ASSERTION CAN BE MORE CONTRARY TO THE LAWS OF RELIGIOUS PROGRESS
6993-83607-0008 THAN THAT WHICH PRETENDS THAT A PURER AND MORE MONOTHEISTIC RELIGION EXISTS AMONG NATIONS DEVOID OF MYTHOLOGY THERE ARE ONLY TWO INSTANCES ON THE AMERICAN CONTINENT
6993-83607-0009 WHERE THE WORSHIP OF AN IMMATERIAL GOD WAS DEFINITELY INSTITUTED AND THESE AS THE HIGHEST CONQUESTS OF AMERICAN NATURAL RELIGIONS DESERVE ESPECIAL MENTION THEY OCCURRED AS WE MIGHT EXPECT IN THE TWO MOST CIVILIZED NATIONS
6993-83607-0010 AND THE NAHUAS OF TEZCUCO IT IS RELATED THAT ABOUT THE YEAR FOURTEEN FORTY AT A GRAND RELIGIOUS COUNCIL HELD AT THE CONSECRATION OF THE NEWLY BUILT TEMPLE OF THE SUN AT CUZCO THE INCA YUPANQUI
6993-83607-0011 ROSE BEFORE THE ASSEMBLED MULTITUDE AND SPOKE SOMEWHAT AS FOLLOWS MANY SAY THAT THE SUN IS THE MAKER OF ALL THINGS BUT HE WHO MAKES SHOULD ABIDE BY WHAT HE HAS MADE
6993-83607-0012 NOW MANY THINGS HAPPEN WHEN THE SUN IS ABSENT THEREFORE HE CANNOT BE THE UNIVERSAL CREATOR AND THAT HE IS ALIVE AT ALL IS DOUBTFUL FOR HIS TRIPS DO NOT TIRE HIM WERE HE A LIVING THING HE WOULD GROW WEARY LIKE OURSELVES
6993-83607-0013 WERE HE FREE HE WOULD VISIT OTHER PARTS OF THE HEAVENS HE IS LIKE A TETHERED BEAST WHO MAKES A DAILY ROUND UNDER THE EYE OF A MASTER HE IS LIKE AN ARROW WHICH MUST GO WHITHER IT IS SENT NOT WHITHER IT WISHES
6993-83607-0014 I TELL YOU THAT HE OUR FATHER AND MASTER THE SUN MUST HAVE A LORD AND MASTER MORE POWERFUL THAN HIMSELF
6993-83607-0015 A NAME WAS PROCLAIMED BASED UPON THAT OF THE HIGHEST DIVINITIES KNOWN TO THE ANCIENT AYMARA RACE ILLATICI VIRACOCHA PACHACAMAC LITERALLY THE THUNDER VASE THE FOAM OF THE SEA
6993-83607-0016 IN A VALE BY THE SEA NEAR CALLAO WHEREIN HIS WORSHIP WAS TO BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT IMAGES OR HUMAN SACRIFICES THE INCA WAS AHEAD OF HIS AGE HOWEVER AND WHEN THE SPANIARDS VISITED THE TEMPLE OF PACHACAMAC IN FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE
6993-83607-0017 THEY FOUND NOT ONLY THE WALLS ADORNED WITH HIDEOUS PAINTINGS BUT AN UGLY IDOL OF WOOD REPRESENTING A MAN OF COLOSSAL PROPORTIONS SET UP THEREIN
6993-83607-0018 AT LENGTH IN INDIGNATION AND DESPAIR THE PRINCE EXCLAIMED VERILY THESE GODS THAT I AM ADORING WHAT ARE THEY BUT IDOLS OF STONE WITHOUT SPEECH OR FEELING THEY COULD NOT HAVE MADE THE BEAUTY OF THE HEAVEN THE SUN THE MOON
6993-83607-0019 AND THE STARS WHICH ADORN IT AND WHICH LIGHT THE EARTH WITH ITS COUNTLESS STREAMS ITS FOUNTAINS AND WATERS ITS TREES AND PLANTS AND ITS VARIOUS INHABITANTS THERE MUST BE SOME GOD INVISIBLE AND UNKNOWN
6993-83607-0020 WHO IS THE UNIVERSAL CREATOR HE ALONE CAN CONSOLE ME IN MY AFFLICTION AND TAKE AWAY MY SORROW STRENGTHENED IN THIS CONVICTION BY A TIMELY FULFILMENT OF HIS HEART'S DESIRE
6993-83607-0021 HE ERECTED A TEMPLE NINE STORIES HIGH TO REPRESENT THE NINE HEAVENS WHICH HE DEDICATED TO THE UNKNOWN GOD THE CAUSE OF CAUSES THIS TEMPLE HE ORDAINED SHOULD NEVER BE POLLUTED BY BLOOD
6993-83607-0022 FOR THE POPULAR ONE THE INCA CONTINUED TO RECEIVE THE HOMAGE OF HIS SUBJECTS AS A BROTHER OF THE SUN AND THE REGULAR SERVICES TO THAT LUMINARY WERE NEVER INTERRUPTED
6993-83607-0023 NOR DID THE PRINCE OF TEZCUCO AFTERWARDS NEGLECT THE HONORS DUE HIS NATIONAL GODS NOR EVEN REFRAIN HIMSELF FROM PLUNGING THE KNIFE INTO THE BREASTS OF CAPTIVES
6993-83607-0024 NOT IN CONTRAST TO POLYTHEISM BUT IN LIVING INTUITION IN THE RELIGIOUS SENTIMENTS IF THIS SUBTLE BUT TRUE DISTINCTION BE RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD IT WILL EXCITE NO SURPRISE TO FIND SUCH EPITHETS AS ENDLESS
6993-83607-0025 OMNIPOTENT INVISIBLE ADORABLE SUCH APPELLATIONS AS THE MAKER AND MOULDER OF ALL THE MOTHER AND FATHER OF LIFE THE ONE GOD COMPLETE IN PERFECTION AND UNITY
6993-83607-0026 THE CREATOR OF ALL THAT IS THE SOUL OF THE WORLD IN USE AND OF UNDOUBTED INDIGENOUS ORIGIN NOT ONLY AMONG THE CIVILIZED AZTECS BUT EVEN AMONG THE HAITIANS THE ARAUCANIANS
6993-83607-0027 WE SHALL BE FAR FROM REGARDING THEM AS FAMILIAR TO THE POPULAR MIND
6993-83607-0028 AND MAGNILOQUENCE USED BY THE PRIESTS AND DEVOTEES OF EVERY SEVERAL GOD TO DO HIM HONOR THEY PROVE SOMETHING IN REGARD TO A CONSCIOUSNESS OF DIVINITY HEDGING US ABOUT BUT NOTHING AT ALL IN FAVOR OF A RECOGNITION OF ONE GOD
6993-83607-0029 THEY EXEMPLIFY HOW PROFOUND IS THE CONVICTION OF A HIGHEST AND FIRST PRINCIPLE BUT THEY DO NOT OFFER THE LEAST REASON TO SURMISE THAT THIS WAS A LIVING REALITY IN DOCTRINE OR PRACTICE
6993-83607-0030 THE CONFUSION OF THESE DISTINCT IDEAS HAS LED TO MUCH MISCONCEPTION OF THE NATIVE CREEDS BUT ANOTHER AND MORE FATAL ERROR WAS THAT WHICH DISTORTED THEM INTO A DUALISTIC FORM
6993-83607-0031 RANGING ON ONE HAND THE GOOD SPIRIT WITH HIS LEGIONS OF ANGELS ON THE OTHER THE EVIL ONE WITH HIS SWARMS OF FIENDS REPRESENTING THE WORLD AS THE SCENE OF THEIR UNENDING CONFLICT MAN AS THE UNLUCKY FOOTBALL
6993-83607-0032 WHO GETS ALL THE BLOWS THIS NOTION WHICH HAS ITS HISTORICAL ORIGIN AMONG THE PARSEES OF ANCIENT IRAN IS UNKNOWN TO SAVAGE NATIONS THE IDEA OF THE DEVIL JUSTLY OBSERVES JACOB GRIMM
6993-83607-0033 IS FOREIGN TO ALL PRIMITIVE RELIGIONS YET PROFESSOR MUELLER IN HIS VOLUMINOUS WORK ON THOSE OF AMERICA AFTER APPROVINGLY QUOTING THIS SAYING COMPLACENTLY PROCEEDS TO CLASSIFY THE DEITIES AS GOOD
6993-83607-0034 HAS ARISEN PARTLY FROM HABITS OF THOUGHT DIFFICULT TO BREAK PARTLY FROM MISTRANSLATIONS OF NATIVE WORDS PARTLY FROM THE FOOLISH AXIOM OF THE EARLY MISSIONARIES THE GODS OF THE GENTILES ARE DEVILS
6993-83607-0035 YET THEIR OWN WRITINGS FURNISH CONCLUSIVE PROOF THAT NO SUCH DISTINCTION EXISTED OUT OF THEIR OWN FANCIES THE SAME WORD OTKON WHICH FATHER BRUYAS EMPLOYS TO TRANSLATE INTO IROQUOIS THE TERM DEVIL
6993-83607-0036 HE TOLD THEM THAT THE DEITY THEY ADORED WAS A DEMON WHO LOVED ALL EVIL THINGS AND THEY MUST HATE HIM WHEREUPON HIS AUDITORS REPLIED THAT SO FAR FROM THIS BEING THE CASE WHOM HE CALLED A WICKED BEING WAS THE POWER THAT SENT THEM ALL GOOD THINGS
6993-83607-0037 WRITTEN IN SIXTEEN TWENTY TWO THE AUTHOR SAYS THAT THE INDIANS WORSHIP A GOOD POWER CALLED KIEHTAN AND ANOTHER WHO AS FARRE AS WEE CAN CONCEIVE IS THE DEVILL NAMED HOBBAMOCK OR HOBBAMOQUI
6993-83607-0038 THE FORMER OF THESE NAMES IS MERELY THE WORD GREAT IN THEIR DIALECT OF ALGONKIN WITH A FINAL N AND IS PROBABLY AN ABBREVIATION OF KITTANITOWIT THE GREAT MANITO
6993-83607-0039 A VAGUE TERM MENTIONED BY ROGER WILLIAMS AND OTHER EARLY WRITERS
6993-83607-0040 THE KINDLY GOD WHO CURED DISEASES AIDED THEM IN THE CHASE AND APPEARED TO THEM IN DREAMS AS THEIR PROTECTOR THEREFORE WITH GREAT JUSTICE DOCTOR JARVIS HAS EXPLAINED IT TO MEAN
6993-83607-0041 TO WHOM THEY PRAY TO THE NEGLECT OF A BETTER ONE IS IN REALITY THE HIGHEST POWER THEY RECOGNIZE
6993-83607-0042 AND SAID TO BE THEIR WICKED SPIRIT IS IN FACT THE ONLY NAME IN THEIR LANGUAGE FOR SPIRITUAL EXISTENCE IN GENERAL
6993-83607-0043 IS THE BENIGN POWER APPEALED TO BY THEIR PRIESTS WHO IS THRONED IN THE PLEIADES WHO SENDS FRUITS AND FLOWERS TO THE EARTH
6993-83607-0044 THE SHADOWY EMBODIMENT OF EVIL BUT SIMPLY AND SOLELY THEIR GOD OF THE DEAD THE PLUTO OF THEIR PANTHEON CORRESPONDING TO THE MICTLA OF THE MEXICANS THE EVIDENCE ON THE POINT IS INDEED CONCLUSIVE
6993-83607-0045 THE JESUIT MISSIONARIES VERY RARELY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL DEITIES WHEN SPEAKING OF THE RELIGION OF THE NORTHERN TRIBES AND THE MORAVIAN BRETHREN AMONG THE ALGONKINS AND IROQUOIS PLACE ON RECORD
6993-83607-0046 THEIR UNANIMOUS TESTIMONY THAT THE IDEA OF A DEVIL A PRINCE OF DARKNESS THEY FIRST RECEIVED IN LATER TIMES
6993-83607-0047 JUST AS MUCH THE IDEA OF A BAD AS OF A GOOD SPIRIT HE IS UNAWARE OF ANY DISTINCTION
6993-83607-0048 AND AM PERSUADED THAT THOSE PERSONS WHO REPRESENT THEM AS DOING SO DO IT INCONSIDERATELY AND BECAUSE IT IS SO NATURAL TO SUBSCRIBE TO A LONG CHERISHED POPULAR OPINION
6993-83607-0049 VERY SOON AFTER COMING IN CONTACT WITH THE WHITES THE INDIANS CAUGHT THE NOTION OF A BAD AND GOOD SPIRIT PITTED ONE AGAINST THE OTHER IN ETERNAL WARFARE AND ENGRAFTED IT ON THEIR ANCIENT TRADITIONS
6993-83607-0050 BUT AS A POPULAR ERROR IT STILL HOLDS ITS GROUND WITH REFERENCE TO THE MORE BARBAROUS AND LESS KNOWN TRIBES PERHAPS NO MYTH HAS BEEN SO OFTEN QUOTED IN ITS CONFIRMATION AS THAT OF THE ANCIENT IROQUOIS WHICH NARRATES
6993-83607-0051 THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE FIRST TWO BROTHERS OF OUR RACE IT IS OF UNDOUBTED NATIVE ORIGIN AND VENERABLE ANTIQUITY THE VERSION GIVEN BY THE TUSCARORA CHIEF CUSIC IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE
6993-83607-0052 RELATES THAT IN THE BEGINNING OF THINGS THERE WERE TWO BROTHERS
6993-83607-0053 FOR IN THE DARK REALMS OF THE UNDERWORLD HE STILL LIVES RECEIVING THE SOULS OF THE DEAD AND BEING THE AUTHOR OF ALL EVIL NOW WHEN WE COMPARE THIS WITH THE VERSION OF THE SAME LEGEND GIVEN BY FATHER BREBEUF
6993-83607-0054 MISSIONARY TO THE HURONS IN SIXTEEN THIRTY SIX WE FIND ITS WHOLE COMPLEXION ALTERED THE MORAL DUALISM VANISHES THE NAMES GOOD MIND AND BAD MIND DO NOT APPEAR IT IS THE STRUGGLE OF IOSKEHA THE WHITE ONE
6993-83607-0055 WITH HIS BROTHER TAWISCARA THE DARK ONE AND WE AT ONCE PERCEIVE THAT CHRISTIAN INFLUENCE IN THE COURSE OF TWO CENTURIES HAD GIVEN THE TALE A MEANING FOREIGN TO ITS ORIGINAL INTENT
6993-83607-0056 SO IT IS WITH THE STORY THE ALGONKINS TELL OF THEIR HERO MANIBOZHO WHO IN THE OPINION OF A WELL KNOWN WRITER
6993-83607-0057 THIS FAMOUS MAGICIAN TRIED HIS ARTS ON THE PRINCE OF SERPENTS AFTER A PROLONGED STRUGGLE WHICH BROUGHT ON THE GENERAL DELUGE AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WORLD HE WON THE VICTORY THE FIRST AUTHORITY WE HAVE FOR THIS NARRATIVE
6993-83607-0058 IN SIXTEEN THIRTY FOUR IS QUITE DISSIMILAR AND MAKES NO MENTION OF A SERPENT AND AS WE SHALL HEREAFTER SEE NEITHER AMONG THE ALGONKINS NOR ANY OTHER INDIANS WAS THE SERPENT USUALLY A TYPE OF EVIL
6993-83607-0059 FINDS A REMARKABLE PROOF IN THE MYTHS OF THE QUICHES WHICH WERE COMMITTED TO WRITING IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THEY NARRATE THE STRUGGLES BETWEEN THE RULERS OF THE UPPER AND THE NETHER WORLD THE DESCENT OF THE FORMER INTO XIBALBA
6993-83607-0060 THE REALM OF PHANTOMS AND THEIR VICTORY OVER ITS LORDS ONE DEATH AND SEVEN DEATHS THE WRITER ADDS OF THE LATTER WHO CLEARLY REPRESENT TO HIS MIND THE EVIL ONE AND HIS ADJUTANTS IN THE OLD TIMES
6993-83607-0061 THEY DID NOT HAVE MUCH POWER THEY WERE BUT ANNOYERS AND OPPOSERS OF MEN
6993-83607-0062 THE WRITER APPEARS TO COMPARE THE GREAT POWER ASSIGNED BY THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION TO SATAN AND HIS ALLIES WITH THE VERY MUCH LESS POTENCY ATTRIBUTED TO THEIR ANALOGUES IN HEATHENDOM
6993-83607-0063 THE GODS OF THE PRIMITIVE MAN ARE BEINGS OF THOROUGHLY HUMAN PHYSIOGNOMY PAINTED WITH COLORS FURNISHED BY INTERCOURSE WITH HIS FELLOWS THESE ARE HIS ENEMIES OR HIS FRIENDS AS HE CONCILIATES OR INSULTS THEM
6993-83607-0064 NO MERE MAN LEAST OF ALL A SAVAGE IS KIND AND BENEVOLENT IN SPITE OF NEGLECT AND INJURY NOR IS ANY MAN CAUSELESSLY AND CEASELESSLY MALICIOUS PERSONAL FAMILY OR NATIONAL FEUDS RENDER SOME MORE INIMICAL
6993-83607-0065 THAN OTHERS BUT ALWAYS FROM A DESIRE TO GUARD THEIR OWN INTERESTS NEVER OUT OF A DELIGHT IN EVIL FOR ITS OWN SAKE THUS THE CRUEL GODS OF DEATH DISEASE AND DANGER WERE NEVER OF SATANIC NATURE
6993-83607-0066 WHILE THE KINDLIEST DIVINITIES WERE DISPOSED TO PUNISH AND THAT SEVERELY ANY NEGLECT OF THEIR CEREMONIES MORAL DUALISM CAN ONLY ARISE IN MINDS WHERE THE IDEAS OF GOOD AND EVIL ARE NOT SYNONYMOUS WITH THOSE OF PLEASURE AND PAIN
6993-83607-0067 FOR THE CONCEPTION OF A WHOLLY GOOD OR A WHOLLY EVIL NATURE REQUIRES THE USE OF THESE TERMS IN THEIR HIGHER ETHICAL SENSE
