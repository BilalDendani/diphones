4841-26660-0000 IT WAS NOT THAT THE MONEY HAD BEEN MADE IN COMMERCE HE WAS NEITHER A SNOB NOR A CAD ALTHOUGH HIS OWN CONNECTIONS ENTITLED HIM TO HONOR WHAT MORE COULD HE EXPECT THAN TO MARRY WEALTH AND BE HAPPY IF IF HAPPINESS COULD COME TO EITHER OF THEM IN THAT WAY
4841-26660-0001 NO HIS HEART DID NOT LEAN TOWARD HER IT WAS BETTER THAT HE SHOULD BEND TO HIS PROFESSION IN A STRANGE LAND BUT NOT THIS TO LIVE A HERMIT'S LIFE IN A CABIN ON A WILD HILLTOP HOW LONG MUST IT BE HOW LONG
4841-26660-0002 BROODING THUS HE GAZED AT THE DISTANCE OF EVER PALING BLUE AND MECHANICALLY COUNTED THE RANGES AND PEAKS BELOW HIM AN INACCESSIBLE TANGLE OF LAUREL AND RHODODENDRON CLOTHED THE ROUGH AND PRECIPITOUS WALL OF THE MOUNTAIN SIDE
4841-26660-0003 WHICH FELL SHEER DOWN UNTIL LOST IN PURPLE SHADOW WITH A MANTLE OF GREEN DEEP AND RICH VARIED BY THE GRAY OF THE LICHEN COVERED ROCKS THE BROWNS AND REDS OF THE BARE BRANCHES OF DECIDUOUS TREES
4841-26660-0004 AND THE PALER TINTS OF FEATHERY PINES HERE AND THERE FROM DAMP SPRINGY PLACES DARK HEMLOCKS ROSE OUT OF THE MASS
4841-26660-0005 GIANT SENTINELS OF THE WILDERNESS GRADUALLY HIS MOOD OF BROODING RETROSPECT CHANGED AND HE KNEW HIMSELF TO BE GLAD TO HIS HEART'S CORE HE COULD UNDERSTAND WHY OUT OF THE TURMOIL OF THE MIDDLE AGES
4841-26660-0006 MEN CHOSE TO GO TO SEQUESTERED PLACES AND BECOME HERMITS NO TRAGEDIES COULD BE IN THIS PRIMEVAL SPOT AND HERE HE WOULD REST AND BUILD AGAIN FOR THE FUTURE HE WAS PLEASED TO SIT THUS MUSING
4841-26660-0007 FOR THE CLIMB HAD TAKEN MORE STRENGTH THAN HE COULD WELL SPARE HIS CABIN WAS NOT YET HABITABLE FOR THE SIMPLE THINGS DOCTOR HOYLE HAD ACCUMULATED TO SERVE HIS NEEDS WERE STILL LOCKED IN WELL BUILT CUPBOARDS AS HE HAD LEFT THEM
4841-26660-0008 THRYNG MEANT SOON TO GO TO WORK TO TAKE OUT THE BED COVERS AND AIR THEM AND TO FIND THE CANVAS AND NAIL IT OVER THE FRAMEWORK BESIDE THE CABIN WHICH WAS TO SERVE AS A SLEEPING APARTMENT ALL SHOULD BE DONE IN TIME
4841-26660-0009 THAT WAS A GOOD FRAMEWORK STRONGLY BUILT WITH THE CORNER POSTS SET DEEP IN THE GROUND TO KEEP IT FIRM ON THIS WINDSWEPT HEIGHT AND WITH A DOOR IN THE SIDE OF THE CABIN OPENING INTO THE CANVAS ROOM AH YES
4841-26660-0010 ALL THAT THE OLD DOCTOR DID WAS WELL AND THOROUGHLY DONE HIS APPETITE SHARPENED BY THE CLIMB AND THE BRACING AIR DAVID INVESTIGATED THE CONTENTS OF ONE OF THOSE MELON SHAPED BASKETS WHICH CASSANDRA HAD GIVEN HIM WHEN HE STARTED FOR HIS NEW HOME THAT MORNING
4841-26660-0011 WITH LITTLE HOYLE AS HIS GUIDE AH WHAT HOSPITABLE KINDNESS THEY HAD SHOWN TO HIM A STRANGER HERE WERE DELICATE BITS OF FRIED CHICKEN
4841-26660-0012 AND A BOTTLE OF MILK NOTHING BETTER NEED A MAN ASK AND WHAT ANIMALS MEN ARE AFTER ALL HE THOUGHT TAKING DELIGHT IN THE MERE ACTS OF EATING AND BREATHING AND SLEEPING UTTERLY WEARY HE WOULD NOT TROUBLE TO OPEN THE COT WHICH LAY IN THE CABIN
4841-26660-0013 BUT ROLLED HIMSELF IN HIS BLANKET ON THE WIDE FLAT ROCK AT THE VERGE OF THE MOUNTAIN HERE WARMED BY THE SUN HE LAY WITH HIS FACE TOWARD THE BLUE DISTANCE AND SLEPT DREAMLESSLY AND SOUNDLY VERY SOUNDLY
4841-26660-0014 FOR HE WAS NOT AWAKENED BY A CRACKLING OF THE BRUSH AND SCRAMBLING OF FEET STRUGGLING UP THE MOUNTAIN WALL BELOW HIS HARD RESTING PLACE YET THE SOUND KEPT ON AND SOON A HEAD APPEARED ABOVE THE ROCK AND TWO HANDS WERE PLACED UPON IT
4841-26660-0015 ONLY A FEW FEET AWAY FROM THE SLEEPER IT WAS FRALE HIS SOFT FELT HAT ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND THE CURL OF DARK HAIR FALLING UPON HIS FOREHEAD FOR AN INSTANT AS HE GAZED ON THE SLEEPING FIGURE
4841-26660-0016 THE WILD LOOK OF FEAR WAS IN HIS EYES THEN AS HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF THE WORDS OF AUNT SALLY THEY IS A MAN THAR THE EXPRESSION CHANGED TO ONE MORE MALEVOLENT AND REPULSIVE TRANSFORMING AND AGING THE BOYISH FACE
4841-26660-0017 CAUTIOUSLY HE CREPT NEARER AND PEERED INTO THE FACE OF THE UNCONSCIOUS ENGLISHMAN HIS HANDS CLINCHED AND HIS LIPS TIGHTENED
4841-26660-0018 HE DREW BACK IN SHAME AND LOOKED DOWN AT HIS HANDS BLOOD GUILTY HANDS AS HE KNEW THEM TO BE
4841-26660-0019 HE MOVED SWIFTLY AWAY HE WAS A YOUTH AGAIN HUNGRY AND SAD STUMBLING ALONG THE UNTRODDEN WAY AVOIDING THE BEATEN PATH YET UNERRINGLY TAKING HIS COURSE TOWARD THE CLEFT ROCK AT THE HEAD OF THE FALL BEHIND THE GREAT HOLLY TREE
4841-26660-0020 IT WAS NOT THE FOOD CASSANDRA HAD PROMISED HIM THAT HE WANTED NOW BUT TO LOOK INTO THE EYES OF ONE WHO WOULD PITY AND LOVE HIM HEARTSICK AND WEARY AS HE NEVER HAD BEEN IN ALL HIS YOUNG LIFE LONELY BEYOND BEARING HE HURRIED ALONG
4841-26660-0021 AS HE FORCED A PATH THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH HE HEARD THE SOUND OF A MOUNTAIN STREAM AND SEEKING IT HE FOLLOWED ALONG ITS ROCKY BED LEAPING FROM ONE HUGE BLOCK OF STONE TO ANOTHER AND SWINGING HIMSELF ACROSS BY GREAT OVERHANGING SYCAMORE BOUGHS
4841-26660-0022 DRAWING BY ITS MANY WINDINGS NEARER AND NEARER TO THE SPOT
4841-26660-0023 UNTIL AT LAST MAKING A SLIGHT DETOUR HE CAME UPON THE VERY EDGE OF THE DESCENT WHERE HE COULD LOOK DOWN AND SEE HIS HOME NESTLED IN THE COVE AT THE FOOT OF THE FALL THE BLUE SMOKE CURLING UPWARD FROM ITS GREAT CHIMNEY
4841-26660-0024 HE SEATED HIMSELF UPON A JUTTING ROCK WELL SCREENED BY LAUREL SHRUBS ON ALL SIDES BUT THE ONE TOWARD THE FALL THERE HIS KNEES CLASPED ABOUT WITH HIS ARMS AND HIS CHIN RESTING UPON THEM HE SAT AND WATCHED
4841-26660-0025 BEHIND THE LEAFAGE AND TANGLE OF BARE STEMS AND TWIGS
4841-26660-0026 THUS ENABLING HIM TO SEE PLAINLY WHAT WAS TRANSPIRING ABOUT THE HOUSE AND SHEDS WITHOUT HIMSELF BEING SEEN LONG AND PATIENTLY HE WAITED ONCE A DOG BARKED HIS OWN DOG NIG SOME ONE MUST BE APPROACHING
4841-26660-0027 WHAT IF THE LITTLE CREATURE SHOULD SEEK HIM OUT AND BETRAY HIM HE QUIVERED WITH THE THOUGHT THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD DRIVEN HIM DOWN THE MOUNTAIN BEATING HIM OFF WHENEVER HE RETURNED SHOULD THE ANIMAL PERSIST IN TRACKING HIM HE WOULD KILL HIM
4841-26660-0028 HE PEERED MORE EAGERLY DOWN AND SAW LITTLE HOYLE RUN OUT OF THE COW SHED AND TWIST HIMSELF THIS WAY AND THAT TO SEE UP AND DOWN THE ROAD BOTH THE CHILD AND THE DOG SEEMED EXCITED YES THERE THEY WERE THREE HORSEMEN COMING ALONG THE HIGHWAY
4841-26660-0029 NOW THEY WERE DISMOUNTING AND QUESTIONING THE BOY NOW THEY DISAPPEARED IN THE HOUSE HE DID NOT MOVE WHY WERE THEY SO LONG WITHIN HOURS IT SEEMED TO FRALE BUT IN REALITY IT WAS ONLY A SHORT SEARCH THEY WERE MAKING THERE THEY WERE LONGER LOOKING ABOUT THE SHEDS AND YARD
4841-26660-0030 HOYLE ACCOMPANIED THEM EVERYWHERE HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS STANDING ABOUT SHIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT ALL AROUND THEY WENT PEERING AND SEARCHING THRUSTING THEIR ARMS AS FAR AS THEY COULD REACH INTO THE STACKS OF FODDER LOOKING INTO TROUGHS AND CORN SACKS
4841-26660-0031 SETTING THE FOWLS TO CACKLING WILDLY EVEN HAULING OUT THE LONG CORN STALKS FROM THE WAGON WHICH HAD SERVED TO MAKE THRYNG'S RIDE THE NIGHT BEFORE COMFORTABLE NO SPOT WAS OVERLOOKED FREQUENTLY THEY STOOD AND PARLEYED THEN FRALE'S HEART WOULD SINK WITHIN HIM
4841-26660-0032 WHAT IF THEY SHOULD SET NIG TO TRACK HIM AH HE WOULD STRANGLE THE BEAST AND PITCH HIM OVER THE FALL HE WOULD SPRING OVER AFTER HIM BEFORE HE WOULD LET HIMSELF BE TAKEN AND HANGED OH HE COULD FEEL THE STRANGLING ROPE AROUND HIS NECK ALREADY HE COULD NOT BEAR IT
4841-26660-0033 HE COULD NOT THUS COWERING HE WAITED STARTING AT EVERY SOUND FROM BELOW AS IF TO RUN THEN SINKING BACK IN FEAR BREATHLESS WITH THE POUNDING OF HIS HEART IN HIS BREAST NOW THE VOICES CAME UP TO HIM PAINFULLY CLEAR
4841-26660-0034 THEY WERE TALKING TO LITTLE HOYLE ANGRILY WHAT THEY WERE SAYING HE COULD NOT MAKE OUT BUT HE AGAIN CAUTIOUSLY LIFTED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED BELOW SUDDENLY THE CHILD DREW BACK AND LIFTED HIS ARM AS IF TO WARD OFF A BLOW BUT THE BLOW CAME
4841-26660-0035 FRALE SAW ONE OF THE MEN TURN AS HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE TO RIDE AWAY AND CUT THE BOY CRUELLY ACROSS HIS FACE AND ARM WITH HIS RAWHIDE WHIP THE LITTLE ONE'S SHRIEK OF FRIGHT AND PAIN PIERCED HIS BIG BROTHER TO THE HEART AND CAUSED HIM TO FORGET FOR THE MOMENT HIS OWN ABJECT FEAR
4841-26660-0036 HE MADE AS IF HE WOULD LEAP THE INTERVENING SPACE TO PUNISH THE BRUTE BUT A CRY OF ANGER DIED IN HIS THROAT AS HE REALIZED HIS SITUATION THE SELFISHNESS OF HIS FEAR HOWEVER WAS DISPELLED
4841-26660-0037 AND HE NO LONGER CRINGED AS BEFORE BUT HAD THE COURAGE AGAIN TO WATCH AWAKE AND ALERT TO ALL THAT PASSED BENEATH HIM HOYLE'S CRY BROUGHT CASSANDRA OUT OF THE HOUSE FLYING
4841-26660-0038 FRALE ROSE TO HIS KNEES AND STRAINED EAGERLY FORWARD IF YOU ARE SUCH A COWARD YOU MUST HIT SOMETHING SMALL AND WEAK YOU CAN STRIKE A WOMAN HIT ME SHE PANTED PUTTING THE CHILD BEHIND HER MUTTERING THE MAN RODE SULLENLY AWAY
4841-26660-0039 LIST'NIN TO ALL WE SAY FRALE COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE WORDS BUT HIS FACE BURNED RED WITH RAGE HAD HE BEEN IN HIDING DOWN BELOW HE WOULD HAVE WREAKED VENGEANCE ON THE MAN AS IT WAS
4841-26660-0040 HE STOOD UP AND BOLDLY WATCHED THEM RIDE AWAY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THEY HAD COME HE SANK BACK AND WAITED AND AGAIN THE HOURS PASSED ALL WAS STILL BUT THE RUSHING WATER AND THE GENTLE SOUGHING OF THE WIND IN THE TOPS OF THE TOWERING PINES
4841-26660-0041 AT LAST HE HEARD A RUSTLING AND SNIFFING HERE AND THERE HIS HEART STOOD STILL THEN POUNDED AGAIN IN TERROR THEY HAD THEY HAD SET NIG TO TRACK HIM OF COURSE THE DOG WOULD SEEK FOR HIS OLD FRIEND AND COMRADE AND THEY
4841-26660-0042 THEY WOULD WAIT UNTIL THEY HEARD HIS BARK OF JOY AND THEN THEY WOULD SEIZE HIM HE CREPT CLOSE TO THE ROCK WHERE THE WATER RUSHED NOT A FOOT AWAY AND CLINGING TO THE TOUGH LAUREL BEHIND HIM LEANED FAR OVER
4841-26660-0043 TO DROP DOWN THERE WOULD MEAN INSTANT DEATH ON THE ROCKS BELOW IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE ALMOST AS HORRIBLE AS THE STRANGLING ROPE HE WOULD WAIT UNTIL THEY WERE ON HIM AND THEN
4841-26660-0044 WHICH WERE DRAWN TO A NARROW BLUE GLEAM AS HE WAITED
