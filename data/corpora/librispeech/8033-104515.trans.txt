8033-104515-0000 MOUNTJOY WHEN HE REACHED CAPTAIN VIGNOLLES'S ROOMS WAS RECEIVED APPARENTLY WITH GREAT INDIFFERENCE
8033-104515-0001 I SAW MOODY THIS MORNING AND HE SAID HE WOULD LOOK IN IF HE WAS PASSING THIS WAY NOW SIT DOWN AND TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING SINCE YOU DISAPPEARED IN THAT REMARKABLE MANNER THIS WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT MOUNTJOY HAD EXPECTED
8033-104515-0002 BUT HE COULD ONLY SIT DOWN AND SAY THAT HE HAD DONE NOTHING IN PARTICULAR
8033-104515-0003 WOULD BE THE WORST WITH WHOM TO PLAY ALONE DURING THE ENTIRE EVENING AND MOUNTJOY REMEMBERED NOW
8033-104515-0004 SIMPLY AS A PIECE OF PREY WHOM CHANCE HAD THROWN UP ON THE SHORE AND MOODY WHO WOULD NO DOUBT SHOW HIMSELF BEFORE LONG WAS ANOTHER BIRD OF THE SAME COVEY THOUGH LESS RAPACIOUS MOUNTJOY PUT HIS HAND UP
8033-104515-0005 TO HIS BREAST POCKET AND KNEW THAT THE FIFTY POUNDS WAS THERE BUT HE KNEW ALSO THAT IT WOULD SOON BE GONE EVEN TO HIM IT SEEMED TO BE EXPEDIENT TO GET UP AND AT ONCE TO GO WHAT DELIGHT WOULD THERE BE
8033-104515-0006 TO HIM IN PLAYING PIQUET WITH SUCH A FACE OPPOSITE TO HIM AS THAT OF CAPTAIN VIGNOLLES
8033-104515-0007 NO PLEASANT HUM OF THE VOICES OF COMPANIONS NO SENSE OF HIS OWN EQUALITY WITH OTHERS THERE WOULD BE NONE TO SYMPATHIZE WITH HIM WHEN HE CURSED HIS ILL LUCK THERE WOULD BE NO CHANCE OF CONTENDING WITH AN INNOCENT
8033-104515-0008 WHO WOULD BE AS RECKLESS AS WAS HE HIMSELF HE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM WAS GLOOMY AND UNCOMFORTABLE
8033-104515-0009 AND WAS AFRAID THAT HIS PREY WAS ABOUT TO ESCAPE WON'T YOU LIGHT A CIGAR MOUNTJOY TOOK THE CIGAR AND THEN FELT THAT HE COULD NOT GO QUITE AT ONCE I SUPPOSE YOU WENT TO MONACO I WAS THERE FOR A SHORT TIME
8033-104515-0010 MONACO ISN'T BAD THOUGH THERE IS OF COURSE THE PULL WHICH THE TABLES HAVE AGAINST YOU BUT IT'S A GRAND THING TO THINK THAT SKILL CAN BE OF NO AVAIL
8033-104515-0011 YES I I DON'T DENY THAT I'M THE LUCKIEST FELLOW GOING BUT I NEVER CAN REMEMBER CARDS OF COURSE I KNOW MY TRADE EVERY FELLOW KNOWS HIS TRADE AND I'M UP PRETTY NEARLY IN ALL THAT THE BOOKS TELL YOU THAT'S A GREAT DEAL
8033-104515-0012 NOT WHEN YOU COME TO PLAY WITH MEN WHO KNOW WHAT PLAY IS LOOK AT GROSSENGRANNEL I'D SOONER BET ON HIM THAN ANY MAN IN LONDON GROSSENGRANNEL NEVER FORGETS A CARD I'LL BET A HUNDRED POUNDS THAT HE KNOWS THE BEST CARD
8033-104515-0013 IN EVERY SUIT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY'S PLAY THAT'S HIS SECRET HE GIVES HIS MIND TO IT WHICH I CAN'T HANG IT I'M ALWAYS THINKING OF SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT OF WHAT I'M GOING TO EAT
8033-104515-0014 IN THE TEETH OF ALL HIS LONGINGS IN OPPOSITION TO ALL HIS THIRST MOUNTJOY FOR A MINUTE OR TWO DID THINK THAT HE COULD RISE AND GO HIS FATHER WAS ABOUT TO PUT HIM ON HIS LEGS AGAIN IF ONLY HE WOULD ABSTAIN
8033-104515-0015 AND ASKED THAT IT MIGHT BE ONLY TEN SHILLINGS A GAME
8033-104515-0016 OH HANG IT SAID VIGNOLLES STILL HOLDING THE PACK IN HIS HANDS WHEN THUS APPEALED TO MOUNTJOY RELENTED AND AGREED
8033-104515-0017 WHO PLAYED HIS CARDS WITH GREAT ATTENTION AND NEVER SPOKE A WORD EITHER THEN OR AT ANY OTHER PERIOD OF HIS LIFE HE WAS THE MOST TACITURN OF MEN AND WAS KNOWN NOT AT ALL TO ANY OF HIS COMPANIONS IT WAS RUMORED OF HIM
8033-104515-0018 THAT HE HAD A WIFE AT HOME WHOM HE KEPT IN MODERATE COMFORT ON HIS WINNINGS IT SEEMED TO BE THE SOLE DESIRE OF HIS HEART TO PLAY WITH RECKLESS FOOLISH YOUNG MEN WHO UP TO A CERTAIN POINT DID NOT CARE WHAT THEY LOST
8033-104515-0019 AND AT ELEVEN HE RETURNED AND REMAINED AS LONG AS THERE WERE MEN TO PLAY WITH A TEDIOUS AND UNSATISFACTORY LIFE HE HAD AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL FOR HIM COULD HIS FRIENDS HAVE PROCURED ON HIS BEHOOF THE COMPARATIVE EASE
8033-104515-0020 OR CARED TO INQUIRE HE HAD BEEN RECEIVED AS MAJOR MOODY FOR TWENTY YEARS OR MORE AND TWENTY YEARS IS SURELY TIME ENOUGH TO SETTLE A MAN'S CLAIM TO A MAJORITY WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE ARMY LIST HOW ARE YOU MAJOR MOODY ASKED MOUNTJOY
8033-104515-0021 ARRANGING THE CARDS AND THE CHAIRS NOT FOR ME SAID MOUNTJOY WHO SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ENVELOPED BY A MOST UNUSUAL PRUDENCE WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID YOU WHO USED TO FEAR NEITHER MAN NOR DEVIL
8033-104515-0022 I'M HOST HERE AND OF COURSE WILL GIVE WAY TO ANYTHING YOU MAY PROPOSE WHAT'S IT TO BE SCARBOROUGH POUNDS AND FIVES I SHAN'T PLAY HIGHER THAN THAT
8033-104515-0023 AS HE STATED THE STAKES FOR WHICH HE CONSENTED TO PLAY A REMEMBRANCE THAT IN THE OLD DAYS HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN CALLED CAPTAIN SCARBOROUGH BY THIS MAN WHO NOW LEFT OUT THE CAPTAIN OF COURSE HE HAD FALLEN SINCE THAT
8033-104515-0024 FALLEN VERY LOW HE OUGHT TO FEEL OBLIGED TO ANY MAN WHO HAD IN THE OLD DAYS BEEN A MEMBER OF THE SAME CLUB WITH HIM WHO WOULD NOW GREET HIM WITH THE FAMILIARITY OF HIS UNADORNED NAME BUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE OLD SOUNDS CAME BACK UPON HIS EAR
8033-104515-0025 HE HAD BEEN KNOWN TO THE WORLD AT LARGE AS CAPTAIN SCARBOROUGH OF TRETTON WELL WELL POUNDS AND FIVES SAID VIGNOLLES
8033-104515-0026 BUT WHERE THEY ALTERNATE SO QUICKLY IT AMOUNTS TO NOTHING YOU'VE GOT THE FIRST DUMMY SCARBOROUGH
8033-104515-0027 I DO BELIEVE THAT AT WHIST EVERYTHING DEPENDS UPON THE CARDS OR ELSE ON THE HINGES I'VE KNOWN ELEVEN RUBBERS RUNNING TO FOLLOW THE HINGES PEOPLE LAUGH AT ME BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN LUCK I SPEAK AS I FIND IT THAT'S ALL
8033-104515-0028 YOU'VE TURNED UP AN HONOR ALREADY WHEN A MAN BEGINS WITH AN HONOR HE'LL ALWAYS GO ON WITH HONORS THAT'S MY OBSERVATION I KNOW YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD AT THIS GAME MOODY SO I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU TO ARRANGE THE PLAY AND WILL FOLLOW UP AS WELL AS I CAN
8033-104515-0029 YOU LEAD UP TO THE WEAK OF COURSE THIS WAS NOT SAID TILL THE CARD WAS OUT OF HIS PARTNER'S HAND BUT WHEN YOUR ADVERSARY HAS GOT ACE KING QUEEN IN HIS OWN HAND THERE IS NO WEAK WELL WE'VE SAVED THAT
8033-104515-0030 BUT EVEN MOUNTJOY WAS TOO PRUDENT HE DID NOT TAKE THE CIGAR BUT HE DID WIN THE RUBBER YOU'RE IN FOR A GOOD THING TO NIGHT I FEEL AS CERTAIN OF IT AS THOUGH THE MONEY WERE IN YOUR POCKET MOUNTJOY THOUGH HE WOULD NOT SMOKE DID DRINK
8033-104515-0031 ASKED FOR BARLEY WATER AS THERE WAS NONE HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SIPPING APOLLINARIS A CLOSE RECORD OF THE EVENTS OF THAT EVENING WOULD MAKE BUT A TEDIOUS TALE FOR READERS MOUNTJOY OF COURSE LOST HIS FIFTY POUNDS ALAS
8033-104515-0032 THE MAJOR PERTINACIOUSLY REFUSED TO INCREASE HIS STAKES AND WORSE AGAIN REFUSED TO PLAY FOR ANYTHING BUT READY MONEY IT'S A KIND OF THING I NEVER DO YOU MAY THINK ME VERY ODD BUT IT'S A KIND OF THING I NEVER DO
8033-104515-0033 THAT HE DID IN FACT PLAY ON CREDIT AT THE CLUB THE COMMITTEE LOOK TO THAT
8033-104515-0034 THEN VIGNOLLES OFFERED AGAIN TO TAKE THE DUMMY SO THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO NECESSITY FOR MOODY AND SCARBOROUGH TO PLAY AGAINST EACH OTHER AND OFFERED TO GIVE ONE POINT EVERY OTHER RUBBER AS THE PRICE TO BE PAID FOR THE ADVANTAGE BUT MOODY
8033-104515-0035 THAT'LL BE HARD ON SCARBOROUGH I'LL GO ON FOR MONEY SAID THE IMMOVABLE MAJOR I SUPPOSE YOU WON'T HAVE IT OUT WITH ME AT DOUBLE DUMMY SAID VIGNOLLES TO HIS VICTIM BUT DOUBLE DUMMY IS A TERRIBLE GRIND AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT
8033-104515-0036 SO AS TO SHOW THAT THE AMUSEMENT FOR THE NIGHT WAS OVER HE TOO SAW THE DIFFICULTY WHICH MOODY SO PERTINACIOUSLY AVOIDED HE HAD BEEN TOLD WONDROUS THINGS OF THE OLD SQUIRE'S INTENTIONS TOWARD HIS ELDEST SON BUT HE HAD BEEN TOLD THEM
8033-104515-0037 BUT HE WOULD MORE PROBABLY OBTAIN PAYMENT OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS NOW DUE TO HIM THAT OR NEARLY THAT THAN OF A LARGER SUM HE ALREADY HAD IN HIS POSSESSION THE OTHER TWENTY POUNDS WHICH POOR MOUNTJOY HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM
8033-104515-0038 IT WAS A WRITTEN PROMISE TO PAY TO CAPTAIN VIGNOLLES THE EXACT SUM OF TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN POUNDS ON OR BEFORE THAT DAY WEEK YOU'LL BE PUNCTUAL WON'T YOU OF COURSE I'LL BE PUNCTUAL SAID MOUNTJOY SCOWLING WELL YES NO DOUBT
8033-104515-0039 BUT THERE HAVE BEEN MISTAKES I TELL YOU YOU'LL BE PAID WHY THE DEVIL DID YOU WIN IT OF ME IF YOU DOUBT IT I SAW YOU JUST ROAMING ABOUT AND I MEANT TO BE GOOD NATURED YOU KNOW AS WELL AS ANY MAN WHAT CHANCES YOU SHOULD RUN
8033-104515-0040 AND WHEN TO HOLD YOUR HAND IF YOU TELL ME ABOUT MISTAKES I SHALL MAKE IT PERSONAL I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING SCARBOROUGH THAT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN UP IN THAT WAY HANG YOUR SCARBOROUGH
8033-104515-0041 THEN HE SMASHED DOWN HIS HAT UPON HIS HEAD AND LEFT THE ROOM
8033-104515-0042 IN WHICH ONE GLASS WAS LEFT AND SAT HIMSELF DOWN WITH THE DOCUMENT IN HIS HAND JUST THE SAME FELLOW HE SAID TO HIMSELF OVERBEARING RECKLESS PIG HEADED AND A BULLY HE'D LOSE THE BANK OF ENGLAND IF HE HAD IT BUT THEN HE DON'T PAY
8033-104515-0043 HE HASN'T A SCRUPLE ABOUT THAT IF I LOSE I HAVE TO PAY BY JOVE YES NEVER DIDN'T PAY A SHILLING I LOST IN MY LIFE IT'S DEUCED HARD WHEN A FELLOW IS ON THE SQUARE LIKE THAT TO MAKE TWO ENDS MEET WHEN HE COMES ACROSS DEFAULTERS THOSE FELLOWS SHOULD BE HUNG
8033-104515-0044 WELCHER IS A THING YOU NEEDN'T HAVE TO DO WITH IF YOU'RE CAREFUL BUT WHEN A FELLOW TURNS ROUND UPON YOU AS A DEFAULTER AT CARDS THERE IS NO GETTING RID OF HIM
8033-104515-0045 AS HE SAT THERE LOOKING AT THE SUSPICIOUS DOCUMENT WHICH MOUNTJOY HAD LEFT IN HIS HANDS TO HIM IT WAS A FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN CRUELLY USED IN HAVING SUCH A BIT OF PAPER THRUST UPON HIM INSTEAD OF BEING PAID BY A CHECK
8033-104515-0046 WHICH ON THE MORNING WOULD BE HONORED AND AS HE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN CAREER HIS READY MONEY PAYMENTS HIS OBEDIENCE TO CERTAIN RULES OF THE GAME RULES I MEAN AGAINST CHEATING
8033-104515-0047 AS HE THOUGHT OF HIS HANDS WHICH IN HIS OWN ESTIMATION WERE BEAUTIFULLY CLEAN HIS DILIGENCE IN HIS PROFESSION WHICH TO HIM WAS HONORABLE HIS HARD WORK HIS LATE HOURS HIS DEVOTION TO A TASK WHICH WAS OFTEN TEDIOUS
8033-104515-0048 HIS MANY PERIODS OF HEART RENDING LOSS WHICH WHEN THEY OCCURRED WOULD DRIVE HIM NEARLY MAD HIS SMALL CUSTOMARY GAINS
