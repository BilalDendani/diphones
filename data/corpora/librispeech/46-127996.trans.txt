46-127996-0000 CROMWELL HAD TO DETERMINE WHETHER HE WOULD PUT TO HAZARD THE ATTACHMENT OF HIS PARTY THE ATTACHMENT OF HIS ARMY HIS OWN GREATNESS NAY HIS OWN LIFE IN AN ATTEMPT WHICH WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN VAIN TO SAVE A PRINCE WHOM NO ENGAGEMENT COULD BIND
46-127996-0001 WITH MANY STRUGGLES AND MISGIVINGS AND PROBABLY NOT WITHOUT MANY PRAYERS THE DECISION WAS MADE CHARLES WAS LEFT TO HIS FATE THE MILITARY SAINTS RESOLVED THAT IN DEFIANCE OF THE OLD LAWS OF THE REALM
46-127996-0002 AND OF THE ALMOST UNIVERSAL SENTIMENT OF THE NATION THE KING SHOULD EXPIATE HIS CRIMES WITH HIS BLOOD HE FOR A TIME EXPECTED A DEATH LIKE THAT OF HIS UNHAPPY PREDECESSORS EDWARD THE SECOND AND RICHARD THE SECOND
46-127996-0003 BUT HE WAS IN NO DANGER OF SUCH TREASON THOSE WHO HAD HIM IN THEIR GRIPE WERE NOT MIDNIGHT STABBERS WHAT THEY DID THEY DID IN ORDER THAT IT MIGHT BE A SPECTACLE TO HEAVEN AND EARTH AND THAT IT MIGHT BE HELD IN EVERLASTING REMEMBRANCE
46-127996-0004 TO A PARTY BENT ON EFFECTING A COMPLETE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL REVOLUTION IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR PURPOSE IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THEY SHOULD FIRST BREAK IN PIECES EVERY PART OF THE MACHINERY OF THE GOVERNMENT
46-127996-0005 THE LORDS UNANIMOUSLY REJECTED THE PROPOSITION THAT THE KING SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL THEIR HOUSE WAS INSTANTLY CLOSED NO COURT KNOWN TO THE LAW WOULD TAKE ON ITSELF THE OFFICE OF JUDGING THE FOUNTAIN OF JUSTICE
46-127996-0006 A REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL WAS CREATED THAT TRIBUNAL PRONOUNCED CHARLES A TYRANT A TRAITOR A MURDERER AND A PUBLIC ENEMY AND HIS HEAD WAS SEVERED FROM HIS SHOULDERS BEFORE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS IN FRONT OF THE BANQUETING HALL
46-127996-0007 OF HIS OWN PALACE IN NO LONG TIME IT BECAME MANIFEST THAT THOSE POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS TO WHOM THIS DEED IS TO BE ASCRIBED HAD COMMITTED NOT ONLY A CRIME BUT AN ERROR
46-127996-0008 ALL HIS REGAL DIGNITY AND CONFRONTING DEATH WITH DAUNTLESS COURAGE GAVE UTTERANCE TO THE FEELINGS OF HIS OPPRESSED PEOPLE MANFULLY REFUSED TO PLEAD BEFORE A COURT UNKNOWN TO THE LAW APPEALED FROM MILITARY VIOLENCE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSTITUTION
46-127996-0009 ASKED BY WHAT RIGHT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAD BEEN PURGED OF ITS MOST RESPECTABLE MEMBERS AND THE HOUSE OF LORDS DEPRIVED OF ITS LEGISLATIVE FUNCTIONS AND TOLD HIS WEEPING HEARERS THAT HE WAS DEFENDING NOT ONLY HIS OWN CAUSE BUT THEIRS
46-127996-0010 REACTION WHICH NEVER CEASED TILL THE THRONE HAD AGAIN BEEN SET UP IN ALL ITS OLD DIGNITY AT FIRST HOWEVER THE SLAYERS OF THE KING SEEMED TO HAVE DERIVED NEW ENERGY FROM THAT SACRAMENT OF BLOOD BY WHICH THEY HAD BOUND THEMSELVES CLOSELY TOGETHER
46-127996-0011 AND SEPARATED THEMSELVES FOR EVER FROM THE GREAT BODY OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN ENGLAND WAS DECLARED A COMMONWEALTH THE HOUSE OF COMMONS REDUCED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF MEMBERS WAS NOMINALLY THE SUPREME POWER IN THE STATE IN FACT
46-127996-0012 THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE ROUNDHEADS THE ANGLICAN CHURCH THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH ENGLAND SCOTLAND IRELAND YET SUCH WAS HIS GENIUS AND RESOLUTION
46-127996-0013 THAT HE WAS ABLE TO OVERPOWER AND CRUSH EVERYTHING THAT CROSSED HIS PATH TO MAKE HIMSELF MORE ABSOLUTE MASTER OF HIS COUNTRY THAN ANY OF HER LEGITIMATE KINGS HAD BEEN AND TO MAKE HIS COUNTRY MORE DREADED AND RESPECTED THAN SHE HAD BEEN DURING MANY GENERATIONS
46-127996-0014 UNDER THE RULE OF HER LEGITIMATE KINGS ENGLAND HAD ALREADY CEASED TO STRUGGLE BUT THE TWO OTHER KINGDOMS WHICH HAD BEEN GOVERNED BY THE STUARTS WERE HOSTILE TO THE NEW REPUBLIC THE INDEPENDENT PARTY WAS EQUALLY ODIOUS TO THE ROMAN CATHOLICS OF IRELAND
46-127996-0015 AND TO THE PRESBYTERIANS OF SCOTLAND BOTH THOSE COUNTRIES LATELY IN REBELLION AGAINST CHARLES THE FIRST NOW ACKNOWLEDGED THE AUTHORITY OF CHARLES THE SECOND BUT EVERYTHING YIELDED TO THE VIGOUR AND ABILITY OF CROMWELL
46-127996-0016 IN A FEW MONTHS HE SUBJUGATED IRELAND AS IRELAND HAD NEVER BEEN SUBJUGATED DURING THE FIVE CENTURIES OF SLAUGHTER WHICH HAD ELAPSED SINCE THE LANDING OF THE FIRST NORMAN SETTLERS
46-127996-0017 BY MAKING THE ENGLISH AND PROTESTANT POPULATION DECIDEDLY PREDOMINANT FOR THIS END HE GAVE THE REIN TO THE FIERCE ENTHUSIASM OF HIS FOLLOWERS WAGED WAR RESEMBLING THAT WHICH ISRAEL WAGED ON THE CANAANITES SMOTE THE IDOLATERS WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD
46-127996-0018 DROVE MANY THOUSANDS TO THE CONTINENT SHIPPED OFF MANY THOUSANDS TO THE WEST INDIES AND SUPPLIED THE VOID THUS MADE BY POURING IN NUMEROUS COLONISTS OF SAXON BLOOD AND OF CALVINISTIC FAITH STRANGE TO SAY UNDER THAT IRON RULE
46-127996-0019 AND TO CLAMOUR FOR PROTECTING LAWS FROM IRELAND THE VICTORIOUS CHIEF
46-127996-0020 HE HAD CONSENTED TO PROFESS HIMSELF A PRESBYTERIAN
46-127996-0021 THE AUSTERE PURITANS
46-127996-0022 UNDER THEIR INSPECTION AND CONTROL A SOLEMN AND MELANCHOLY COURT THIS MOCK ROYALTY WAS OF SHORT DURATION IN TWO GREAT BATTLES CROMWELL ANNIHILATED THE MILITARY FORCE OF SCOTLAND CHARLES FLED FOR HIS LIFE AND
46-127996-0023 WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY ESCAPED THE FATE OF HIS FATHER THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE STUARTS WAS REDUCED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO PROFOUND SUBMISSION OF THAT INDEPENDENCE SO MANFULLY DEFENDED AGAINST THE MIGHTIEST AND ABLEST OF THE PLANTAGENETS
46-127996-0024 NO VESTIGE WAS LEFT THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT MADE LAWS FOR SCOTLAND ENGLISH JUDGES HELD ASSIZES IN SCOTLAND EVEN THAT STUBBORN CHURCH WHICH HAS HELD ITS OWN AGAINST SO MANY GOVERNMENTS SCARCE DARED TO UTTER AN AUDIBLE MURMUR
46-127996-0025 THE PARLIAMENT FORGOT THAT IT WAS BUT THE CREATURE OF THE ARMY THE ARMY WAS LESS DISPOSED THAN EVER TO SUBMIT TO THE DICTATION OF THE PARLIAMENT INDEED
46-127996-0026 THE FEW MEMBERS WHO MADE UP WHAT WAS CONTEMPTUOUSLY CALLED THE RUMP OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAD NO MORE CLAIM THAN THE MILITARY CHIEFS TO BE ESTEEMED THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION THE DISPUTE WAS SOON BROUGHT TO A DECISIVE ISSUE CROMWELL FILLED THE HOUSE WITH ARMED MEN
46-127996-0027 THE SPEAKER WAS PULLED OUT OF HIS CHAIR THE MACE TAKEN FROM THE TABLE THE ROOM CLEARED AND THE DOOR LOCKED THE NATION WHICH LOVED NEITHER OF THE CONTENDING PARTIES BUT WHICH WAS FORCED IN ITS OWN DESPITE
46-127996-0028 YET WERE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS STILL IMPOSED ON HIM BY THE VERY ARMY TO WHICH HE OWED HIS IMMENSE AUTHORITY THAT SINGULAR BODY OF MEN WAS FOR THE MOST PART COMPOSED OF ZEALOUS REPUBLICANS
46-127996-0029 AND PINED FOR THE FLESHPOTS THE TASKMASTERS AND THE IDOLATRIES OF EGYPT THE OBJECT OF THE WARLIKE SAINTS WHO SURROUNDED CROMWELL WAS THE SETTLEMENT OF A FREE AND PIOUS COMMONWEALTH
46-127996-0030 TO ESTABLISH BY THEIR AID A DICTATORSHIP SUCH AS NO KING HAD EVER EXERCISED BUT IT WAS PROBABLE THAT THEIR AID WOULD BE AT ONCE WITHDRAWN FROM A RULER WHO EVEN UNDER STRICT CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRAINTS
46-127996-0031 THE KINGLY NAME AND DIGNITY THE SENTIMENTS OF CROMWELL WERE WIDELY DIFFERENT HE WAS NOT WHAT HE HAD BEEN
46-127996-0032 HE HAD DURING THE THIRTEEN YEARS WHICH FOLLOWED GONE THROUGH A POLITICAL EDUCATION OF NO COMMON KIND HE HAD BEEN A CHIEF ACTOR IN A SUCCESSION OF REVOLUTIONS HE HAD BEEN LONG THE SOUL AND AT LAST THE HEAD OF A PARTY
46-127996-0033 PACIFIED AND REGULATED KINGDOMS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STRANGE INDEED IF HIS NOTIONS HAD BEEN STILL THE SAME AS IN THE DAYS WHEN HIS MIND WAS PRINCIPALLY OCCUPIED BY HIS FIELDS AND HIS RELIGION AND WHEN THE GREATEST EVENTS WHICH DIVERSIFIED THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE WERE A CATTLE FAIR
46-127996-0034 OR A PRAYER MEETING AT HUNTINGDON HE SAW THAT SOME SCHEMES OF INNOVATION FOR WHICH HE HAD ONCE BEEN ZEALOUS WHETHER GOOD OR BAD IN THEMSELVES WERE OPPOSED TO THE GENERAL FEELING OF THE COUNTRY AND THAT IF HE PERSEVERED IN THOSE SCHEMES HE HAD NOTHING BEFORE HIM
46-127996-0035 BUT CONSTANT TROUBLES WHICH MUST BE SUPPRESSED BY THE CONSTANT USE OF THE SWORD HE THEREFORE WISHED TO RESTORE IN ALL ESSENTIALS THAT ANCIENT CONSTITUTION WHICH THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE HAD ALWAYS LOVED AND FOR WHICH THEY NOW PINED
46-127996-0036 THE COURSE AFTERWARDS TAKEN BY MONK WAS NOT OPEN TO CROMWELL THE MEMORY OF ONE TERRIBLE DAY SEPARATED THE GREAT REGICIDE FOR EVER FROM THE HOUSE OF STUART WHAT REMAINED WAS THAT HE SHOULD MOUNT THE ANCIENT ENGLISH THRONE AND REIGN ACCORDING TO THE ANCIENT ENGLISH POLITY
46-127996-0037 TO THE KINGLY OFFICE THAN TO KING CHARLES THE FIRST OR KING CHARLES THE SECOND WOULD SOON KISS THE HAND OF KING OLIVER THE PEERS WHO NOW REMAINED SULLENLY AT THEIR COUNTRY HOUSES
46-127996-0038 WOULD WHEN SUMMONED TO THEIR HOUSE BY THE WRIT OF A KING IN POSSESSION GLADLY RESUME THEIR ANCIENT FUNCTIONS NORTHUMBERLAND AND BEDFORD MANCHESTER AND PEMBROKE WOULD BE PROUD TO BEAR THE CROWN AND THE SPURS THE SCEPTRE AND THE GLOBE
46-127996-0039 BEFORE THE RESTORER OF ARISTOCRACY A SENTIMENT OF LOYALTY WOULD GRADUALLY BIND THE PEOPLE TO THE NEW DYNASTY AND
46-127996-0040 THE ROYAL DIGNITY MIGHT DESCEND WITH GENERAL ACQUIESCENCE TO HIS POSTERITY THE ABLEST ROYALISTS WERE OF OPINION THAT THESE VIEWS WERE CORRECT AND THAT IF CROMWELL HAD BEEN PERMITTED TO FOLLOW HIS OWN JUDGMENT THE EXILED LINE WOULD NEVER
46-127996-0041 HAVE BEEN RESTORED BUT HIS PLAN WAS DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO THE FEELINGS OF THE ONLY CLASS WHICH HE DARED NOT OFFEND THE NAME OF KING WAS HATEFUL TO THE SOLDIERS SOME OF THEM WERE INDEED UNWILLING TO SEE THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE HANDS OF ANY SINGLE PERSON
46-127996-0042 THE GREAT MAJORITY HOWEVER WERE DISPOSED TO SUPPORT THEIR GENERAL AS ELECTIVE FIRST MAGISTRATE OF A COMMONWEALTH AGAINST ALL FACTIONS WHICH MIGHT RESIST HIS AUTHORITY
46-127996-0043 OR THAT THE DIGNITY WHICH WAS THE JUST REWARD OF HIS PERSONAL MERIT SHOULD BE DECLARED HEREDITARY IN HIS FAMILY
46-127996-0044 AS THE ARMY WOULD BEAR THAT HIS ELEVATION TO POWER MIGHT NOT SEEM TO BE MERELY HIS OWN ACT HE CONVOKED A COUNCIL COMPOSED PARTLY OF PERSONS ON WHOSE SUPPORT HE COULD DEPEND AND PARTLY OF PERSONS WHOSE OPPOSITION HE MIGHT SAFELY DEFY
46-127996-0045 BUT IN A FEW YEARS HE THOUGHT IT SAFE TO PROCEED FURTHER AND TO RESTORE ALMOST EVERY PART OF THE ANCIENT SYSTEM UNDER HEW NAMES AND FORMS THE TITLE OF KING WAS NOT REVIVED
46-127996-0046 GIRT WITH A SWORD OF STATE CLAD IN A ROBE OF PURPLE AND PRESENTED WITH A RICH BIBLE IN WESTMINSTER HALL HIS OFFICE WAS NOT DECLARED HEREDITARY BUT HE WAS PERMITTED TO NAME HIS SUCCESSOR AND NONE COULD DOUBT THAT HE WOULD NAME HIS SON
46-127996-0047 A HOUSE OF COMMONS WAS A NECESSARY PART OF THE NEW POLITY IN CONSTITUTING THIS BODY THE PROTECTOR SHOWED A WISDOM AND A PUBLIC SPIRIT WHICH WERE NOT DULY APPRECIATED BY HIS CONTEMPORARIES
46-127996-0048 THE VICES OF THE OLD REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM THOUGH BY NO MEANS SO SERIOUS AS THEY AFTERWARDS BECAME HAD ALREADY BEEN REMARKED BY FARSIGHTED MEN CROMWELL REFORMED THAT SYSTEM ON THE SAME PRINCIPLES ON WHICH MISTER PITT
46-127996-0049 VERY FEW UNREPRESENTED TOWNS HAD YET GROWN INTO IMPORTANCE OF THOSE TOWNS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE WERE MANCHESTER LEEDS AND HALIFAX REPRESENTATIVES WERE GIVEN TO ALL THREE
46-127996-0050 AN ADDITION WAS MADE TO THE NUMBER OF THE MEMBERS FOR THE CAPITAL THE ELECTIVE FRANCHISE WAS PLACED ON SUCH A FOOTING THAT EVERY MAN OF SUBSTANCE WHETHER POSSESSED OF FREEHOLD ESTATES IN LAND OR NOT HAD A VOTE FOR THE COUNTY IN WHICH HE RESIDED
46-127996-0051 WERE SUMMONED TO THE ASSEMBLY WHICH WAS TO LEGISLATE AT WESTMINSTER FOR EVERY PART OF THE BRITISH ISLES TO CREATE A HOUSE OF LORDS WAS A LESS EASY TASK DEMOCRACY DOES NOT REQUIRE THE SUPPORT OF PRESCRIPTION
46-127996-0052 MONARCHY HAS OFTEN STOOD WITHOUT THAT SUPPORT BUT A PATRICIAN ORDER IS THE WORK OF TIME OLIVER FOUND ALREADY EXISTING A NOBILITY OPULENT HIGHLY CONSIDERED AND AS POPULAR WITH THE COMMONALTY
46-127996-0053 THAT HE OFFERED TO THE CHIEFS OF ILLUSTRIOUS FAMILIES SEATS IN HIS NEW SENATE THEY CONCEIVED THAT THEY COULD NOT ACCEPT A NOMINATION TO AN UPSTART ASSEMBLY
46-127996-0054 THE PROTECTOR WAS THEREFORE UNDER THE NECESSITY OF FILLING HIS UPPER HOUSE WITH NEW MEN WHO DURING THE LATE STIRRING TIMES HAD MADE THEMSELVES CONSPICUOUS
46-127996-0055 HOW OLIVER'S PARLIAMENTS WERE CONSTITUTED HOWEVER WAS PRACTICALLY OF LITTLE MOMENT FOR HE POSSESSED THE MEANS OF CONDUCTING THE ADMINISTRATION WITHOUT THEIR SUPPORT AND IN DEFIANCE OF THEIR OPPOSITION
46-127996-0056 HIS WISH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN TO GOVERN CONSTITUTIONALLY AND TO SUBSTITUTE THE EMPIRE OF THE LAWS FOR THAT OF THE SWORD BUT HE SOON FOUND THAT HATED AS HE WAS BOTH BY ROYALISTS AND PRESBYTERIANS
46-127996-0057 HE COULD BE SAFE ONLY BY BEING ABSOLUTE THE FIRST HOUSE OF COMMONS WHICH THE PEOPLE ELECTED BY HIS COMMAND QUESTIONED HIS AUTHORITY AND WAS DISSOLVED WITHOUT HAVING PASSED A SINGLE ACT HIS SECOND HOUSE OF COMMONS
46-127996-0058 MODERATED ONLY BY THE WISDOM THE SOBRIETY AND THE MAGNANIMITY OF THE DESPOT THE COUNTRY WAS DIVIDED INTO MILITARY DISTRICTS THOSE DISTRICTS WERE PLACED UNDER THE COMMAND OF MAJOR GENERALS
46-127996-0059 BOTH OF CAVALIERS AND LEVELLERS THE LOYAL GENTRY DECLARED THAT THEY WERE STILL AS READY AS EVER TO RISK THEIR LIVES FOR THE OLD GOVERNMENT AND THE OLD DYNASTY IF THERE WERE THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF SUCCESS BUT TO RUSH
46-127996-0060 AT THE HEAD OF THEIR SERVING MEN AND TENANTS ON THE PIKES OF BRIGADES VICTORIOUS IN A HUNDRED BATTLES AND SIEGES WOULD BE A FRANTIC WASTE OF INNOCENT AND HONOURABLE BLOOD BOTH ROYALISTS AND REPUBLICANS
46-127996-0061 ENCOMPASSED HIM THICK ON EVERY SIDE HAD HE BEEN A CRUEL LICENTIOUS AND RAPACIOUS PRINCE THE NATION MIGHT HAVE FOUND COURAGE IN DESPAIR AND MIGHT HAVE MADE A CONVULSIVE EFFORT TO FREE ITSELF FROM MILITARY DOMINATION
46-127996-0062 BUT THE GRIEVANCES WHICH THE COUNTRY SUFFERED THOUGH SUCH AS EXCITED SERIOUS DISCONTENT WERE BY NO MEANS SUCH AS IMPEL GREAT MASSES OF MEN TO STAKE THEIR LIVES THEIR FORTUNES AND THE WELFARE OF THEIR FAMILIES AGAINST FEARFUL ODDS
46-127996-0063 WAS NOT HEAVY WHEN COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE NEIGHBOURING STATES AND WITH THE RESOURCES OF ENGLAND PROPERTY WAS SECURE EVEN THE CAVALIER WHO REFRAINED FROM GIVING DISTURBANCE TO THE NEW SETTLEMENT ENJOYED IN PEACE
46-127996-0064 WHATEVER THE CIVIL TROUBLES HAD LEFT HEM THE LAWS WERE VIOLATED ONLY IN CASES WHERE THE SAFETY OF THE PROTECTOR'S PERSON AND GOVERNMENT WAS CONCERNED JUSTICE WAS ADMINISTERED BETWEEN MAN AND MAN
46-127996-0065 HAD THERE BEEN SO LITTLE RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION THE UNFORTUNATE ROMAN CATHOLICS INDEED WERE HELD TO BE SCARCELY WITHIN THE PALE OF CHRISTIAN CHARITY BUT THE CLERGY OF THE FALLEN ANGLICAN CHURCH
46-127996-0066 IN SPITE OF THE STRONG OPPOSITION OF JEALOUS TRADERS AND FANATICAL THEOLOGIANS PERMITTED TO BUILD A SYNAGOGUE IN LONDON
46-127996-0067 THAT THE TYRANT SUFFERED NONE BUT HIMSELF TO WRONG HIS COUNTRY AND THAT
46-127996-0068 HE HAD AT LEAST GIVEN HER GLORY IN EXCHANGE
46-127996-0069 THE MOST FORMIDABLE POWER IN THE WORLD DICTATED TERMS OF PEACE TO THE UNITED PROVINCES AVENGED THE COMMON INJURIES OF CHRISTENDOM ON THE PIRATES OF BARBARY VANQUISHED THE SPANIARDS BY LAND AND SEA
46-127996-0070 SEIZED ONE OF THE FINEST WEST INDIAN ISLANDS AND ACQUIRED ON THE FLEMISH COAST A FORTRESS WHICH CONSOLED THE NATIONAL PRIDE FOR THE LOSS OF CALAIS SHE WAS SUPREME ON THE OCEAN SHE WAS THE HEAD OF THE PROTESTANT INTEREST
46-127996-0071 ALL THE REFORMED CHURCHES SCATTERED OVER ROMAN CATHOLIC KINGDOMS ACKNOWLEDGED CROMWELL AS THEIR GUARDIAN THE HUGUENOTS OF LANGUEDOC THE SHEPHERDS WHO IN THE HAMLETS OF THE ALPS PROFESSED A PROTESTANTISM OLDER THAN THAT OF AUGSBURG
46-127996-0072 UNLESS FAVOUR WERE SHOWN TO THE PEOPLE OF GOD THE ENGLISH GUNS SHOULD BE HEARD IN THE CASTLE OF SAINT ANGELO IN TRUTH THERE WAS NOTHING WHICH CROMWELL HAD
46-127996-0073 UNHAPPILY FOR HIM HE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF DISPLAYING HIS ADMIRABLE MILITARY TALENTS EXCEPT AGAINST THE INHABITANTS OF THE BRITISH ISLES WHILE HE LIVED HIS POWER STOOD FIRM AN OBJECT OF MINGLED AVERSION ADMIRATION
46-127996-0074 AND DREAD TO HIS SUBJECTS FEW INDEED LOVED HIS GOVERNMENT BUT THOSE WHO HATED IT MOST HATED IT LESS THAN THEY FEARED IT HAD IT BEEN A WORSE GOVERNMENT IT MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN OVERTHROWN IN SPITE OF ALL ITS STRENGTH HAD IT BEEN A WEAKER GOVERNMENT
46-127996-0075 IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN OVERTHROWN IN SPITE OF ALL ITS MERITS BUT IT HAD MODERATION ENOUGH TO ABSTAIN FROM THOSE OPPRESSIONS WHICH DRIVE MEN MAD AND IT HAD A FORCE AND ENERGY WHICH NONE BUT MEN DRIVEN MAD BY OPPRESSION WOULD VENTURE TO ENCOUNTER
