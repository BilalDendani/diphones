7218-80699-0000 THE BOY WHO FOUND FEAR AT LAST ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A WOMAN WHO HAD ONE SON WHOM SHE LOVED DEARLY THE LITTLE COTTAGE IN WHICH THEY DWELT
7218-80699-0001 WAS BUILT ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF A FOREST AND AS THEY HAD NO NEIGHBOURS THE PLACE WAS VERY LONELY AND THE BOY WAS KEPT AT HOME BY HIS MOTHER TO BEAR HER COMPANY THEY WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON A WINTER'S EVENING WHEN A STORM SUDDENLY SPRANG UP
7218-80699-0002 AND THE WIND BLEW THE DOOR OPEN THE WOMAN STARTED AND SHIVERED AND GLANCED OVER HER SHOULDER AS IF SHE HALF EXPECTED TO SEE SOME HORRIBLE THING BEHIND HER GO AND SHUT THE DOOR SHE SAID HASTILY TO HER SON
7218-80699-0003 I FEEL FRIGHTENED FRIGHTENED REPEATED THE BOY WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE TO BE FRIGHTENED WELL JUST FRIGHTENED ANSWERED THE MOTHER
7218-80699-0004 A FEAR OF SOMETHING YOU HARDLY KNOW WHAT TAKES HOLD OF YOU IT MUST BE VERY ODD TO FEEL LIKE THAT REPLIED THE BOY I WILL GO THROUGH THE WORLD AND SEEK FEAR TILL I FIND IT AND THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE HIS MOTHER WAS OUT OF BED
7218-80699-0005 HE HAD LEFT THE FOREST BEHIND HIM AFTER WALKING FOR SOME HOURS HE REACHED A MOUNTAIN WHICH HE BEGAN TO CLIMB NEAR THE TOP IN A WILD AND ROCKY SPOT HE CAME UPON A BAND OF FIERCE ROBBERS
7218-80699-0006 SITTING ROUND A FIRE THE BOY WHO WAS COLD AND TIRED WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE THE BRIGHT FLAMES SO HE WENT UP TO THEM AND SAID GOOD GREETING TO YOU SIRS AND WRIGGLED HIMSELF IN BETWEEN THE MEN
7218-80699-0007 TILL HIS FEET ALMOST TOUCHED THE BURNING LOGS THE ROBBERS STOPPED DRINKING AND EYED HIM CURIOUSLY AND AT LAST THE CAPTAIN SPOKE NO CARAVAN OF ARMED MEN WOULD DARE TO COME HERE
7218-80699-0008 AND WHO ARE YOU TO VENTURE IN SO BOLDLY OH I HAVE LEFT MY MOTHER'S HOUSE IN SEARCH OF FEAR PERHAPS YOU CAN SHOW IT TO ME FEAR IS WHEREVER WE ARE ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN
7218-80699-0009 BUT WHERE ASKED THE BOY LOOKING ROUND I SEE NOTHING
7218-80699-0010 AND BAKE US A CAKE FOR SUPPER REPLIED THE ROBBER AND THE BOY WHO WAS BY THIS TIME QUITE WARM JUMPED UP CHEERFULLY AND SLINGING THE POT OVER HIS ARM
7218-80699-0011 WHEN HE GOT TO THE CHURCHYARD HE COLLECTED SOME STICKS AND MADE A FIRE THEN HE FILLED THE POT WITH WATER FROM A LITTLE STREAM CLOSE BY AND MIXING THE FLOUR AND BUTTER AND SUGAR TOGETHER HE SET THE CAKE ON TO COOK
7218-80699-0012 AND THEN THE BOY LIFTED IT FROM THE POT AND PLACED IT ON A STONE WHILE HE PUT OUT THE FIRE AT THAT MOMENT A HAND WAS STRETCHED FROM A GRAVE AND A VOICE SAID
7218-80699-0013 DO YOU THINK I AM GOING TO GIVE TO THE DEAD THE FOOD OF THE LIVING REPLIED THE BOY WITH A LAUGH AND GIVING THE HAND A TAP WITH HIS SPOON AND PICKING UP THE CAKE
7218-80699-0014 AND THEN THE HAND VANISHED OH HOW NICE THE FIRE IS AND HE FLUNG HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE IT AND SO DID NOT NOTICE THE GLANCES OF SURPRISE CAST BY THE ROBBERS AT EACH OTHER
7218-80699-0015 THERE IS ANOTHER CHANCE FOR YOU SAID ONE AT LENGTH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN LIES A DEEP POOL GO TO THAT AND PERHAPS YOU MAY MEET FEAR ON THE WAY
7218-80699-0016 I HOPE SO INDEED ANSWERED THE BOY AND HE SET OUT AT ONCE HE SOON BEHELD THE WATERS OF THE POOL GLEAMING IN THE MOONLIGHT AND AS HE DREW NEAR HE SAW A TALL SWING STANDING JUST OVER IT
7218-80699-0017 AND IN THE SWING A CHILD WAS SEATED WEEPING BITTERLY THAT IS A STRANGE PLACE FOR A SWING THOUGHT THE BOY BUT I WONDER WHAT HE IS CRYING ABOUT AND HE WAS HURRYING ON TOWARDS THE CHILD
7218-80699-0018 WHEN A MAIDEN RAN UP AND SPOKE TO HIM I WANT TO LIFT MY LITTLE BROTHER FROM THE SWING CRIED SHE BUT IT IS SO HIGH ABOVE ME THAT I CANNOT REACH IF YOU WILL GET CLOSER TO THE EDGE OF THE POOL
7218-80699-0019 AND LET ME MOUNT ON YOUR SHOULDER I THINK I CAN REACH HIM WILLINGLY REPLIED THE BOY AND IN AN INSTANT THE GIRL HAD CLIMBED TO HIS SHOULDERS BUT INSTEAD OF LIFTING THE CHILD FROM THE SWING
7218-80699-0020 AS SHE COULD EASILY HAVE DONE SHE PRESSED HER FEET SO FIRMLY ON EITHER SIDE OF THE YOUTH'S NECK THAT HE FELT THAT IN ANOTHER MINUTE HE WOULD BE CHOKED OR ELSE FALL INTO THE WATER BENEATH HIM
7218-80699-0021 SO GATHERING UP ALL HIS STRENGTH HE GAVE A MIGHTY HEAVE AND THREW THE GIRL BACKWARDS AS SHE TOUCHED THE GROUND A BRACELET FELL FROM HER ARM AND THIS THE YOUTH PICKED UP
7218-80699-0022 AND TURNING TO LOOK FOR THE CHILD HE SAW THAT BOTH IT AND THE SWING HAD VANISHED
7218-80699-0023 WITH THE BRACELET ON HIS ARM THE YOUTH STARTED FOR A LITTLE TOWN WHICH WAS SITUATED IN THE PLAIN ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND AS HUNGRY AND THIRSTY HE ENTERED ITS PRINCIPAL STREET A JEW STOPPED HIM
7218-80699-0024 WHERE DID YOU GET THAT BRACELET ASKED THE JEW IT BELONGS TO ME NO IT IS MINE REPLIED THE BOY IT IS NOT GIVE IT TO ME AT ONCE OR IT WILL BE THE WORSE FOR YOU CRIED THE JEW
7218-80699-0025 LET US GO BEFORE A JUDGE AND TELL HIM OUR STORIES SAID THE BOY IF HE DECIDES IN YOUR FAVOUR YOU SHALL HAVE IT IF IN MINE I WILL KEEP IT TO THIS THE JEW AGREED AND THE TWO WENT TOGETHER TO THE GREAT HALL
7218-80699-0026 IN WHICH THE KADI WAS ADMINISTERING JUSTICE HE LISTENED VERY CAREFULLY TO WHAT EACH HAD TO SAY AND THEN PRONOUNCED HIS VERDICT NEITHER OF THE TWO CLAIMANTS HAD PROVED HIS RIGHT TO THE BRACELET THEREFORE IT MUST REMAIN IN THE POSSESSION OF THE JUDGE
7218-80699-0027 TILL ITS FELLOW WAS BROUGHT BEFORE HIM WHEN THEY HEARD THIS THE JEW AND THE BOY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND THEIR EYES SAID WHERE ARE WE TO GO TO FIND THE OTHER ONE BUT AS THEY KNEW THERE WAS NO USE IN DISPUTING THE DECISION
7218-80699-0028 THEY BOWED LOW AND LEFT THE HALL OF AUDIENCE WANDERING HE KNEW NOT WHITHER THE YOUTH FOUND HIMSELF ON THE SEA SHORE AT A LITTLE DISTANCE WAS A SHIP WHICH HAD STRUCK ON A HIDDEN ROCK AND WAS RAPIDLY SINKING
7218-80699-0029 WHILE ON DECK THE CREW WERE GATHERED WITH FACES WHITE AS DEATH SHRIEKING AND WRINGING THEIR HANDS HAVE YOU MET WITH FEAR SHOUTED THE BOY AND THE ANSWER CAME ABOVE THE NOISE OF THE WAVES
7218-80699-0030 THEN THE BOY FLUNG OFF HIS CLOTHES AND SWAM TO THE SHIP WHERE MANY HANDS WERE HELD OUT TO DRAW HIM ON BOARD THE SHIP IS TOSSED HITHER AND THITHER AND WILL SOON BE SUCKED DOWN CRIED THE CREW AGAIN
7218-80699-0031 DOWN DOWN DOWN TILL AT LAST HIS FEET TOUCHED THE BOTTOM AND HE STOOD UP AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM THERE SURE ENOUGH A SEA MAIDEN WITH A WICKED FACE WAS TUGGING HARD AT A CHAIN
7218-80699-0032 WHICH SHE HAD FASTENED TO THE SHIP WITH A GRAPPLING IRON AND WAS DRAGGING IT BIT BY BIT BENEATH THE WAVES SEIZING HER ARMS IN BOTH HIS HANDS HE FORCED HER TO DROP THE CHAIN AND THE SHIP ABOVE REMAINING STEADY
7218-80699-0033 THE SAILORS WERE ABLE GENTLY TO FLOAT HER OFF THE ROCK THEN TAKING A RUSTY KNIFE FROM A HEAP OF SEAWEED AT HIS FEET HE CUT THE ROPE ROUND HIS WAIST AND FASTENED THE SEA MAIDEN FIRMLY TO A STONE
7218-80699-0034 SO THAT SHE COULD DO NO MORE MISCHIEF AND BIDDING HER FAREWELL HE SWAM BACK TO THE BEACH WHERE HIS CLOTHES WERE STILL LYING THE YOUTH DRESSED HIMSELF QUICKLY AND WALKED ON TILL HE CAME TO A BEAUTIFUL SHADY GARDEN FILLED WITH FLOWERS
7218-80699-0035 AND WITH A CLEAR LITTLE STREAM RUNNING THROUGH THE DAY WAS HOT AND HE WAS TIRED SO HE ENTERED THE GATE AND SEATED HIMSELF UNDER A CLUMP OF BUSHES COVERED WITH SWEET SMELLING RED BLOSSOMS AND IT WAS NOT LONG
7218-80699-0036 BEFORE HE FELL ASLEEP SUDDENLY A RUSH OF WINGS AND A COOL BREEZE AWAKENED HIM AND RAISING HIS HEAD CAUTIOUSLY HE SAW THREE DOVES PLUNGING INTO THE STREAM
7218-80699-0037 THEY SPLASHED JOYFULLY ABOUT AND SHOOK THEMSELVES AND THEN DIVED TO THE BOTTOM OF A DEEP POOL WHEN THEY APPEARED AGAIN THEY WERE NO LONGER THREE DOVES BUT THREE BEAUTIFUL DAMSELS
7218-80699-0038 BEARING BETWEEN THEM A TABLE MADE OF MOTHER OF PEARL ON THIS THEY PLACED DRINKING CUPS FASHIONED FROM PINK AND GREEN SHELLS AND ONE OF THE MAIDENS FILLED A CUP FROM A CRYSTAL GOBLET
7218-80699-0039 AND WAS RAISING IT TO HER MOUTH WHEN HER SISTER STOPPED HER TO WHOSE HEALTH DO YOU DRINK ASKED SHE TO THE YOUTH WHO PREPARED THE CAKE AND RAPPED MY HAND WITH THE SPOON WHEN I STRETCHED IT OUT OF THE EARTH ANSWERED THE MAIDEN
7218-80699-0040 AND WAS NEVER AFRAID AS OTHER MEN WERE BUT TO WHOSE HEALTH DO YOU DRINK TO THE YOUTH ON WHOSE SHOULDERS I CLIMBED AT THE EDGE OF THE POOL AND WHO THREW ME OFF WITH SUCH A JERK
7218-80699-0041 THAT I LAY UNCONSCIOUS ON THE GROUND FOR HOURS REPLIED THE SECOND BUT YOU MY SISTER ADDED SHE TURNING TO THE THIRD GIRL TO WHOM DO YOU DRINK DOWN IN THE SEA I TOOK HOLD OF A SHIP
7218-80699-0042 AND SHOOK IT AND PULLED IT TILL IT WOULD SOON HAVE BEEN LOST SAID SHE AND AS SHE SPOKE SHE LOOKED QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT SHE HAD DONE WITH THE CHAIN IN HER HANDS SEEKING TO WORK MISCHIEF BUT A YOUTH CAME
7218-80699-0043 AND FREED THE SHIP AND BOUND ME TO A ROCK TO HIS HEALTH I DRINK AND THEY ALL THREE LIFTED THEIR CUPS AND DRANK SILENTLY AS THEY PUT THEIR CUPS DOWN THE YOUTH APPEARED BEFORE THEM
7218-80699-0044 AND NOW GIVE ME THE BRACELET THAT MATCHES A JEWELLED BAND WHICH OF A SURETY FELL FROM THE ARM OF ONE OF YOU A JEW TRIED TO TAKE IT FROM ME BUT I WOULD NOT LET HIM HAVE IT
7218-80699-0045 AND HE DRAGGED ME BEFORE THE KADI WHO KEPT MY BRACELET TILL I COULD SHOW HIM ITS FELLOW AND I HAVE BEEN WANDERING HITHER AND THITHER IN SEARCH OF IT AND THAT IS HOW I HAVE FOUND MYSELF IN SUCH STRANGE PLACES
7218-80699-0046 COME WITH US THEN SAID THE MAIDENS AND THEY LED HIM DOWN A PASSAGE INTO A HALL OUT OF WHICH OPENED MANY CHAMBERS EACH ONE OF GREATER SPLENDOUR THAN THE LAST FROM A SHELF HEAPED UP WITH GOLD AND JEWELS
7218-80699-0047 THE ELDEST SISTER TOOK A BRACELET WHICH IN EVERY WAY WAS EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE WHICH WAS IN THE JUDGE'S KEEPING AND FASTENED IT TO THE YOUTH'S ARM GO AT ONCE AND SHOW THIS TO THE KADI SAID SHE AND HE WILL GIVE YOU THE FELLOW TO IT
7218-80699-0048 I SHALL NEVER FORGET YOU ANSWERED THE YOUTH BUT IT MAY BE LONG BEFORE WE MEET AGAIN FOR I SHALL NEVER REST TILL I HAVE FOUND FEAR THEN HE WENT HIS WAY AND WON THE BRACELET FROM THE KADI
7218-80699-0049 AFTER THIS HE AGAIN SET FORTH IN HIS QUEST OF FEAR ON AND ON WALKED THE YOUTH BUT FEAR NEVER CROSSED HIS PATH AND ONE DAY HE ENTERED A LARGE TOWN
7218-80699-0050 WHERE ALL THE STREETS AND SQUARES WERE SO FULL OF PEOPLE HE COULD HARDLY PASS BETWEEN THEM WHY ARE ALL THESE CROWDS GATHERED TOGETHER HE ASKED OF A MAN WHO STOOD NEXT HIM THE RULER OF THIS COUNTRY IS DEAD
7218-80699-0051 WAS THE REPLY AND AS HE HAD NO CHILDREN IT IS NEEDFUL TO CHOOSE A SUCCESSOR THEREFORE EACH MORNING ONE OF THE SACRED PIGEONS IS LET LOOSE FROM THE TOWER YONDER AND ON WHOMSOEVER THE BIRD SHALL PERCH
7218-80699-0052 THAT MAN IS OUR KING IN A FEW MINUTES THE PIGEON WILL FLY WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS EVERY EYE WAS FIXED ON THE TALL TOWER WHICH STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF THE CHIEF SQUARE
7218-80699-0053 AND THE MOMENT THAT THE SUN WAS SEEN TO STAND STRAIGHT OVER IT A DOOR WAS OPENED AND A BEAUTIFUL PIGEON GLEAMING WITH PINK AND GREY BLUE AND GREEN CAME RUSHING THROUGH THE AIR ONWARD IT FLEW ONWARD ONWARD
7218-80699-0054 TILL AT LENGTH IT RESTED ON THE HEAD OF THE BOY THEN A GREAT SHOUT AROSE
7218-80699-0055 A VISION SWIFTER THAN LIGHTNING FLASHED ACROSS HIS BRAIN HE SAW HIMSELF SEATED ON A THRONE SPENDING HIS LIFE TRYING AND NEVER SUCCEEDING TO MAKE POOR PEOPLE RICH MISERABLE PEOPLE HAPPY
7218-80699-0056 BAD PEOPLE GOOD NEVER DOING ANYTHING HE WISHED TO DO NOT ABLE EVEN TO MARRY THE GIRL THAT HE LOVED
7218-80699-0057 BUT THE CROWDS WHO HEARD HIM THOUGHT HE WAS OVERCOME BY THE GRANDEUR THAT AWAITED HIM AND PAID NO HEED
7218-80699-0058 A COLD SHIVER THAT HE KNEW NOT THE MEANING OF RAN THROUGH HIM THIS IS FEAR WHOM YOU HAVE SO LONG SOUGHT WHISPERED A VOICE
7218-80699-0059 WHICH SEEMED TO REACH HIS EARS ALONE AND THE YOUTH BOWED HIS HEAD AS THE VISION ONCE MORE FLASHED BEFORE HIS EYES AND HE ACCEPTED HIS DOOM
