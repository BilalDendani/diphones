1165-135220-0000 CHAPTER FIVE THE TORRENT SWEEPING UNDER THE MOUNTAINS THE BOAT DRIFTED ON THE LIGHT GIVEN BY THE AURORA AND THE LOW MOON SEEMED TO GROW FAINTER
1165-135220-0001 AND AS I LOOKED BEHIND I SAW THAT THE DISTANT GLOW FROM THE VOLCANIC FIRES HAD BECOME MORE BRILLIANT IN THE INCREASING DARKNESS THE SIDES OF THE CHANNEL GREW STEEPER UNTIL AT LAST THEY BECAME ROCKY PRECIPICES RISING TO AN UNKNOWN HEIGHT
1165-135220-0002 BUT WITH THIS LESSENING WIDTH THE WATERS SEEMED TO RUSH FAR MORE SWIFTLY HERE I DRIFTED HELPLESSLY AND SAW THE GLOOMY ROCKY CLIFFS SWEEP PAST ME AS I WAS HURLED ONWARD ON THE BREAST OF THE TREMENDOUS FLOOD I WAS IN DESPAIR
1165-135220-0003 THE FATE OF AGNEW HAD PREPARED ME FOR MY OWN AND I WAS ONLY THANKFUL THAT MY FATE SINCE IT WAS INEVITABLE WOULD BE LESS APPALLING DEATH SEEMED CERTAIN AND MY CHIEF THOUGHT NOW WAS AS TO THE MOMENT WHEN IT WOULD COME I WAS PREPARED
1165-135220-0004 FAR BETTER WAS A DEATH HERE AMID THE ROAR OF WATERS THAN AT THE HANDS OF THOSE ABHORRENT BEINGS BY WHOSE TREACHERY MY FRIEND HAD FALLEN AS I WENT ON THE PRECIPICES ROSE HIGHER AND SEEMED TO OVERHANG THE CHANNEL GREW NARROWER
1165-135220-0005 THE LIGHT GREW FAINTER UNTIL AT LAST ALL AROUND ME GREW DARK I WAS FLOATING AT THE BOTTOM OF A VAST CHASM WHERE THE SIDES SEEMED TO RISE PRECIPITOUSLY FOR THOUSANDS OF FEET WHERE NEITHER WATERY FLOOD NOR ROCKY WALL WAS VISIBLE
1165-135220-0006 AND WHERE FAR ABOVE I COULD SEE THE LINE OF SKY BETWEEN THE SUMMITS OF THE CLIFFS AND WATCH THE GLOWING STARS AND AS I WATCHED THEM THERE CAME TO ME THE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS MY LAST SIGHT ON EARTH
1165-135220-0007 AND I COULD ONLY HOPE THAT THE LIFE WHICH WAS SO SWIFTLY APPROACHING ITS END MIGHT LIVE AGAIN SOMEWHERE AMONG THOSE GLITTERING ORBS SO I THOUGHT AND WITH THESE THOUGHTS I DRIFTED ON I CANNOT TELL HOW LONG
1165-135220-0008 UNTIL AT LENGTH THERE APPEARED A VAST BLACK MASS WHERE THE OPEN SKY ABOVE ME TERMINATED
1165-135220-0009 THIS THEN I THOUGHT IS THE END HERE AMID THIS DARKNESS I MUST MAKE THE AWFUL PLUNGE AND FIND MY DEATH I FELL UPON MY KNEES IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT AND PRAYED AS I KNELT THERE THE BOAT DREW NEARER THE BLACK MASS GREW BLACKER
1165-135220-0010 THE CURRENT SWEPT ME ON THERE WERE NO BREAKERS THERE WAS NO PHOSPHORESCENT SPARKLE OF SEETHING WATERS AND NO WHITENESS OF FOAM I THOUGHT THAT I WAS ON THE BRINK OF SOME TREMENDOUS CATARACT A THOUSAND TIMES DEEPER THAN NIAGARA
1165-135220-0011 SOME FALL WHERE THE WATERS PLUNGED INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH AND WHERE GATHERING FOR THE TERRIFIC DESCENT ALL OTHER MOVEMENTS ALL DASHINGS AND WRITHINGS AND TWISTINGS WERE OBLITERATED AND LOST IN THE ONE OVERWHELMING ONWARD RUSH
1165-135220-0012 SUDDENLY ALL GREW DARK DARK BEYOND ALL EXPRESSION THE SKY ABOVE WAS IN A MOMENT SNATCHED FROM VIEW I HAD BEEN FLUNG INTO SOME TREMENDOUS CAVERN AND THERE ON MY KNEES WITH TERROR IN MY HEART I WAITED FOR DEATH
1165-135220-0013 THE MOMENTS PASSED AND DEATH DELAYED TO COME
1165-135220-0014 AND THOUGH I REMAINED ON MY KNEES AND WAITED LONG STILL THE END CAME NOT THE WATERS SEEMED STILL THE BOAT MOTIONLESS IT WAS BORNE UPON THE SURFACE OF A VAST STREAM AS SMOOTH AS GLASS BUT WHO COULD TELL HOW DEEP THAT STREAM WAS OR HOW WIDE
1165-135220-0015 AT LENGTH I ROSE FROM MY KNEES AND SANK DOWN UPON THE SEAT OF THE BOAT AND TRIED TO PEER THROUGH THE GLOOM IN VAIN
1165-135220-0016 I LISTENED BUT HEARD NOTHING SAVE A DEEP DULL DRONING SOUND WHICH SEEMED TO FILL ALL THE AIR AND MAKE IT ALL TREMULOUS WITH ITS VIBRATIONS I TRIED TO COLLECT MY THOUGHTS
1165-135220-0017 AND WHICH I HAD MENTIONED TO AGNEW THIS WAS THE NOTION THAT AT EACH POLE THERE IS A VAST OPENING
1165-135220-0018 FOR IN THAT DARKNESS THERE WERE NO VISIBLE OBJECTS BY WHICH I COULD FIND OUT THE RATE OF MY PROGRESS AND AS THOSE WHO GO UP IN BALLOONS ARE UTTERLY INSENSIBLE OF MOTION
1165-135220-0019 AT LENGTH THERE CAME INTO VIEW SOMETHING WHICH ARRESTED MY ATTENTION AND ENGROSSED ALL MY THOUGHTS IT WAS FAINT GLOW THAT AT FIRST CAUGHT MY GAZE AND ON TURNING TO SEE IT BETTER I SAW A ROUND RED SPOT GLOWING LIKE FIRE
1165-135220-0020 I HAD NOT SEEN THIS BEFORE IT LOOKED LIKE THE MOON WHEN IT RISES FROM BEHIND CLOUDS AND GLOWS RED AND LURID FROM THE HORIZON AND SO THIS GLOWED BUT NOT WITH THE STEADY LIGHT OF THE MOON
1165-135220-0021 FOR THE LIGHT WAS FITFUL AND SOMETIMES FLASHED INTO A BALEFUL BRIGHTNESS WHICH SOON SUBSIDED INTO A DIMMER LUSTRE NEW ALARM AROSE WITHIN ME FOR THIS NEW SIGHT SUGGESTED SOMETHING MORE TERRIBLE THAN ANYTHING THAT I HAD THUS FAR THOUGHT OF
1165-135220-0022 THIS THEN I THOUGHT WAS TO BE THE END OF MY VOYAGE THIS WAS MY GOAL A PIT OF FIRE INTO WHICH I SHOULD BE HURLED WOULD IT BE WELL I THOUGHT TO WAIT FOR SUCH A FATE AND EXPERIENCE SUCH A DEATH AGONY
1165-135220-0023 WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER FOR ME TO TAKE MY OWN LIFE BEFORE I SHOULD KNOW THE WORST I TOOK MY PISTOL AND LOADED IT SO AS TO BE PREPARED BUT HESITATED TO USE IT UNTIL MY FATE SHOULD BE MORE APPARENT SO I SAT HOLDING MY PISTOL
1165-135220-0024 PREPARED TO USE IT WATCHING THE LIGHT AND AWAITING THE TIME WHEN THE GLOWING FIRES SHOULD MAKE ALL FURTHER HOPE IMPOSSIBLE
1165-135220-0025 ON THE CONTRARY IT SEEMED TO GROW FAINTER THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER CHANGE INSTEAD OF SHINING BEFORE ME IT APPEARED MORE ON MY LEFT
1165-135220-0026 ALL THE TIME IT CONTINUED TO GROW FAINTER AND IT SEEMED CERTAIN THAT I WAS MOVING AWAY FROM IT RATHER THAN TOWARD IT IN THE MIDST OF THIS THERE OCCURRED A NEW THOUGHT WHICH SEEMED TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS LIGHT
1165-135220-0027 AND FOLLOWED ME STILL WITH THEIR GLARE I HAD BEEN CARRIED INTO THIS DARKNESS THROUGH SOME VAST OPENING WHICH NOW LAY BEHIND ME DISCLOSING THE RED VOLCANO GLOW AND THIS IT WAS THAT CAUSED THAT ROUNDNESS AND RESEMBLANCE TO THE MOON
1165-135220-0028 I SAW THAT I WAS STILL MOVING ON AWAY FROM THAT LIGHT AS BEFORE AND THAT ITS CHANGING POSITION WAS DUE TO THE TURNING OF THE BOAT AS THE WATER DRIFTED IT ALONG NOW STERN FOREMOST NOW SIDEWISE AND AGAIN BOW FOREMOST
1165-135220-0029 FROM THIS IT SEEMED PLAINLY EVIDENT THAT THE WATERS HAD BORNE ME INTO SOME VAST CAVERN OF UNKNOWN EXTENT WHICH WENT UNDER THE MOUNTAINS A SUBTERRANEAN CHANNEL WHOSE ISSUE I COULD NOT CONJECTURE
1165-135220-0030 PERHAPS IN SOME OTHER OCEAN SOME LAND OF ICE AND FROST AND ETERNAL NIGHT BUT THE OLD THEORY OF THE FLOW OF WATER THROUGH THE EARTH HAD TAKEN HOLD OF ME AND COULD NOT BE SHAKEN OFF I KNEW SOME SCIENTIFIC MEN
1165-135220-0031 HELD THE OPINION THAT THE EARTH'S INTERIOR IS A MASS OF MOLTEN ROCK AND PENT UP FIRE AND THAT THE EARTH ITSELF HAD ONCE BEEN A BURNING ORB WHICH HAD COOLED DOWN AT THE SURFACE YET AFTER ALL THIS WAS ONLY A THEORY AND THERE WERE OTHER THEORIES WHICH WERE TOTALLY DIFFERENT
1165-135220-0032 AS A BOY I HAD READ WILD WORKS OF FICTION ABOUT LANDS IN THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH WITH A SUN AT THE CENTRE WHICH GAVE THEM THE LIGHT OF A PERPETUAL DAY THESE I KNEW WERE ONLY THE CREATIONS OF FICTION
1165-135220-0033 IN THAT CASE THERE MIGHT BE NO SUDDEN PLUNGE AFTER ALL THE STREAM MIGHT RUN ON FOR MANY THOUSAND MILES THROUGH THIS TERRIFIC CAVERN GLOOM IN ACCORDANCE WITH NATURAL LAWS AND I MIGHT THUS LIVE AND DRIFT ON IN THIS DARKNESS UNTIL I SHOULD DIE A LINGERING DEATH OF HORROR AND DESPAIR
1165-135220-0034 THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE WAY OF FORMING ANY ESTIMATE AS TO SPEED ALL WAS DARK AND EVEN THE GLOW BEHIND WAS FADING AWAY NOR COULD I MAKE ANY CONJECTURE WHATEVER AS TO THE SIZE OF THE CHANNEL AT THE OPENING IT HAD BEEN CONTRACTED AND NARROW
1165-135220-0035 BUT HERE IT MIGHT HAVE EXPANDED ITSELF TO MILES AND ITS VAULTED TOP MIGHT REACH ALMOST TO THE SUMMIT OF THE LOFTY MOUNTAINS WHILE SIGHT THUS FAILED ME SOUND WAS EQUALLY UNAVAILING FOR IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME A SUSTAINED AND UNINTERMITTENT ROAR
1165-135220-0036 A LOW DRONING SOUND DEEP AND TERRIBLE WITH NO VARIATIONS OF DASHING BREAKERS OR RUSHING RAPIDS OR FALLING CATARACTS VAGUE THOUGHTS OF FINAL ESCAPE CAME AND WENT BUT IN SUCH A SITUATION HOPE COULD NOT BE SUSTAINED
1165-135220-0037 THE THICK DARKNESS OPPRESSED THE SOUL AND AT LENGTH EVEN THE GLOW OF THE DISTANT VOLCANOES WHICH HAD BEEN GRADUALLY DIMINISHING GREW DIMMER AND FAINTER AND FINALLY FADED OUT ALTOGETHER THAT SEEMED TO ME TO BE MY LAST SIGHT OF EARTHLY THINGS
1165-135220-0038 THE DARKNESS GREW SO INTOLERABLE THAT I LONGED FOR SOMETHING TO DISPEL IT IF ONLY FOR A MOMENT I STRUCK A MATCH THE AIR WAS STILL AND THE FLAME FLASHED OUT LIGHTING UP THE BOAT AND SHOWING THE BLACK WATER AROUND ME THIS MADE ME EAGER TO SEE MORE
1165-135220-0039 I LOADED BOTH BARRELS OF THE RIFLE KEEPING MY PISTOL FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE AND THEN FIRED ONE OF THEM THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS REPORT THAT RANG IN MY EARS LIKE A HUNDRED THUNDER VOLLEYS AND ROLLED AND REVERBERATED FAR ALONG AND DIED AWAY IN ENDLESS ECHOES
1165-135220-0040 LIKE THE SUDDEN LIGHTNING IT REVEALED ALL AROUND I SAW A WIDE EXPANSE OF WATER BLACK AS INK A STYGIAN POOL BUT NO ROCKS WERE VISIBLE AND IT SEEMED AS THOUGH I HAD BEEN CARRIED INTO A SUBTERRANEAN SEA
1165-135220-0041 I LOADED THE EMPTY BARREL AND WAITED THE FLASH OF LIGHT HAD REVEALED NOTHING YET IT HAD DISTRACTED MY THOUGHTS AND THE WORK OF RELOADING WAS AN ADDITIONAL DISTRACTION ANYTHING WAS BETTER THAN INACTION
1165-135220-0042 I DID NOT WISH TO WASTE MY AMMUNITION YET I THOUGHT THAT AN OCCASIONAL SHOT MIGHT SERVE SOME GOOD PURPOSE IF IT WAS ONLY TO AFFORD ME SOME RELIEF FROM DESPAIR AND NOW AS I SAT WITH THE RIFLE IN MY HANDS I WAS AWARE OF A SOUND
1165-135220-0043 NEW EXCITING DIFFERENT ALTOGETHER FROM THE MURMUR OF INNUMERABLE WATERS THAT FILLED MY EARS
1165-135220-0044 IT WAS A SOUND THAT SPOKE OF LIFE I HEARD QUICK HEAVY PANTINGS AS OF SOME GREAT LIVING THING AND WITH THIS THERE CAME THE NOISE OF REGULAR MOVEMENTS IN THE WATER AND THE FOAMING AND GURGLING OF WAVES
1165-135220-0045 IT WAS AS THOUGH SOME LIVING BREATHING CREATURE WERE HERE NOT FAR AWAY MOVING THROUGH THESE MIDNIGHT WATERS AND WITH THIS DISCOVERY THERE CAME A NEW FEAR THE FEAR OF PURSUIT
1165-135220-0046 THIS NEW FEAR AROUSED ME TO ACTION IT WAS A DANGER QUITE UNLIKE ANY OTHER WHICH I HAD EVER KNOWN YET THE FEAR WHICH IT INSPIRED WAS A FEELING THAT ROUSED ME TO ACTION AND PROMPTED ME EVEN THOUGH THE COMING DANGER MIGHT BE AS SURE AS DEATH
1165-135220-0047 TO RISE AGAINST IT AND RESIST TO THE LAST SO I STOOD UP WITH MY RIFLE AND LISTENED WITH ALL MY SOUL IN MY SENSE OF HEARING THE SOUNDS AROSE MORE PLAINLY THEY HAD COME NEARER THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT
1165-135220-0048 I RAISED MY RIFLE AND TOOK AIM THEN IN QUICK SUCCESSION TWO REPORTS THUNDERED OUT WITH TREMENDOUS UPROAR AND INTERMINABLE ECHOES BUT THE LONG REVERBERATIONS WERE UNHEEDED IN THE BLAZE OF SUDDEN LIGHT AND THE VISION THAT WAS REVEALED
1165-135220-0049 FOR THERE FULL BEFORE ME I SAW THOUGH BUT FOR AN INSTANT A TREMENDOUS SIGHT IT WAS A VAST MONSTER MOVING IN THE WATERS AGAINST THE STREAM AND TOWARD THE BOAT ITS HEAD WAS RAISED HIGH ITS EYES WERE INFLAMED WITH A BALEFUL LIGHT
1165-135220-0050 ITS JAWS OPENED WIDE BRISTLED WITH SHARP TEETH AND IT HAD A LONG NECK JOINED TO A BODY OF ENORMOUS BULK WITH A TAIL THAT LASHED ALL THE WATER INTO FOAM IT WAS BUT FOR AN INSTANT THAT I SAW IT
1165-135220-0051 FULL OF TERROR AND EXCITEMENT I LOADED MY RIFLE AGAIN AND WAITED LISTENING FOR A RENEWAL OF THE NOISE I FELT SURE THAT THE MONSTER BALKED OF HIS PREY WOULD RETURN WITH REDOUBLED FURY AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO RENEW THE CONFLICT
1165-135220-0052 I FELT THAT THE DANGERS OF THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE AND OF THE RUSHING WATERS HAD PASSED AWAY AND THAT A NEW PERIL HAD ARISEN FROM THE ASSAULT OF THIS MONSTER OF THE DEEP NOR WAS IT THIS ONE ALONE THAT WAS TO BE DREADED WHERE ONE WAS OTHERS WERE SURE TO BE
1165-135220-0053 AND THESE WOULD PROBABLY INCREASE IN NUMBER AS I ADVANCED FARTHER INTO THIS REALM OF DARKNESS AND YET IN SPITE OF THESE GRISLY THOUGHTS I FELT LESS OF HORROR THAN BEFORE FOR THE FEAR WHICH I HAD WAS NOW ASSOCIATED WITH ACTION
1165-135220-0054 AND AS I STOOD WAITING FOR THE ONSET AND LISTENING FOR THE APPROACH OF THE ENEMY THE EXCITEMENT THAT ENSUED WAS A POSITIVE RELIEF FROM THE DULL DESPAIR INTO WHICH I HAD SUNK BUT A MOMENT BEFORE YET THOUGH I WAITED FOR A NEW ATTACK I WAITED IN VAIN
1165-135220-0055 THE MONSTER DID NOT COME BACK EITHER THE FLASH AND THE NOISE HAD TERRIFIED HIM OR THE BULLETS HAD HIT HIM OR ELSE IN HIS VASTNESS HE HAD BEEN INDIFFERENT TO SO FEEBLE A CREATURE AS MYSELF
1165-135220-0056 BUT WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE HE DID NOT EMERGE AGAIN OUT OF THE DARKNESS AND SILENCE INTO WHICH HE HAD SUNK FOR A LONG TIME I STOOD WAITING THEN I SAT DOWN STILL WATCHFUL STILL LISTENING BUT WITHOUT ANY RESULT
1165-135220-0057 UNTIL AT LENGTH I BEGAN TO THINK THAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF ANY NEW ATTACK INDEED IT SEEMED NOW AS THOUGH THERE HAD BEEN NO ATTACK AT ALL BUT THAT THE MONSTER HAD BEEN SWIMMING AT RANDOM WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT OF ME
1165-135220-0058 IN WHICH CASE MY RIFLE FLASHES HAD TERRIFIED HIM MORE THAN HIS FEARFUL FORM HAD TERRIFIED ME ON THE WHOLE THIS INCIDENT HAD GREATLY BENEFITED ME IT HAD ROUSED ME FROM MY DESPAIR
1165-135220-0059 I GREW RECKLESS AND FELT A DISPOSITION TO ACQUIESCE IN WHATEVER FATE MIGHT HAVE IN STORE FOR ME
