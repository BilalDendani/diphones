4243-14929-0000 HE SEEMS ALMOST AT ONCE TO HAVE ATTAINED POPULARITY AND HE HAS PROGRESSED GRADUALLY SINCE THEN EVER IN AN UPWARD DIRECTION UNTIL HE IS TO DAY ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR AND EXTENSIVELY OWNED VARIETIES OF THE DOG
4243-14929-0001 SIR PAYNTON PIGOTT HAD AT THE DATE MENTIONED A VERY FINE KENNEL OF THE BREED FOR IN THE LIVE STOCK JOURNAL OF MAY THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE
4243-14929-0002 WE FIND HIS KENNEL FULLY REVIEWED IN A MOST ENTHUSIASTIC MANNER BY A CORRESPONDENT WHO VISITED IT IN CONSEQUENCE OF A CONTROVERSY THAT WAS GOING ON AT THE TIME AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS SUCH A DOG AT ALL AND WHO THEREFORE WISHED TO SEE AND JUDGE FOR HIMSELF AS TO THIS POINT
4243-14929-0003 AT THE END OF HIS REPORT ON THE KENNEL
4243-14929-0004 EVEN AS WE KNOW THEM AT THE PRESENT DAY HE WAS CERTAINLY LONGER IN THE BACK THAN WE CARE FOR NOWADAYS AND HIS HEAD ALSO WAS SHORTER AND HIS JAW MORE SNIPY THAN IS NOW SEEN BUT HIS PORTRAIT CLEARLY SHOWS HE WAS A GENUINE SCOTTISH TERRIER AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HE
4243-14929-0005 WITH HIS KENNEL MATES TARTAN CROFTER SYRINGA CAVACK AND POSEY CONFERRED BENEFIT UPON THE BREED TO DIVE DEEPER INTO THE ANTIQUITY OF THE SCOTTISH TERRIER IS A THING WHICH MEANS THAT HE WHO TRIES IT MUST BE PREPARED TO MEET ALL SORTS OF ABUSE RIDICULE AND CRITICISM
4243-14929-0006 ONE MAN WILL TELL YOU THERE NEVER WAS ANY SUCH THING AS THE PRESENT DAY SCOTTISH TERRIER THAT THE MERE FACT OF HIS HAVING PRICK EARS SHOWS HE IS A MONGREL ANOTHER THAT HE IS MERELY AN OFFSHOOT OF THE SKYE OR THE DANDIE ANOTHER THAT THE ONLY SCOTTISH TERRIER THAT IS A SCOTTISH TERRIER
4243-14929-0007 THERE IS STRONG PRESUMPTION THAT THEY ONE AND ALL CAME ORIGINALLY FROM ONE VARIETY AND IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE NAY PROBABLE THAT DIFFERENT CROSSES INTO OTHER VARIETIES HAVE PRODUCED THE ASSORTMENT OF TO DAY
4243-14929-0008 THAT THERE STILL EXIST IN SCOTLAND AT THE PRESENT TIME SPECIMENS OF THE BREED WHICH PROPAGATED THE LOT WHICH WAS WHAT IS CALLED EVEN NOW THE HIGHLAND TERRIER A LITTLE LONG BACKED SHORT LEGGED SNIPY FACED PRICK OR DROP EARED
4243-14929-0009 MOSTLY SANDY AND BLACK COLOURED TERRIER GAME AS A PEBBLE LIVELY AS A CRICKET AND ALL IN ALL A MOST CHARMING LITTLE COMPANION AND FURTHER THAT TO PRODUCE OUR PRESENT DAY SCOTTISH TERRIER OR SHALL WE SAY TO IMPROVE THE POINTS OF HIS PROGENITOR
4243-14929-0010 THE ASSISTANCE OF OUR OLD FRIEND THE BLACK AND TAN WIRE HAIRED TERRIER OF ENGLAND WAS SOUGHT BY A FEW ASTUTE PEOPLE LIVING PROBABLY NOT VERY FAR FROM ABERDEEN SCOTTISH TERRIERS FREQUENTLY GO BY THE NAME OF ABERDEEN TERRIERS AN APPELLATION IT IS TRUE
4243-14929-0011 USUALLY HEARD ONLY FROM THE LIPS OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT THEM MISTER W L MC CANDLISH ONE OF THE GREATEST LIVING AUTHORITIES ON THE BREED
4243-14929-0012 IN AN ABLE TREATISE PUBLISHED SOME TIME BACK TELLS US IN REFERENCE TO THIS MATTER THAT THE TERRIER UNDER NOTICE WENT AT DIFFERENT PERIODS UNDER THE NAMES OF HIGHLAND CAIRN ABERDEEN AND SCOTCH THAT HE IS NOW KNOWN BY THE PROUD TITLE OF SCOTTISH TERRIER
4243-14929-0013 AND THAT THE ONLY SURVIVING TRACE OF THE DIFFERING NOMENCLATURE IS THE TITLE ABERDEEN WHICH MANY PEOPLE STILL REGARD AS A DIFFERENT BREED A WANT OF KNOWLEDGE FREQUENTLY TURNED TO ACCOUNT BY THE UNSCRUPULOUS DEALER WHO IS ABLE TO SELL UNDER THE NAME OF ABERDEEN
4243-14929-0014 WHEREAS THEY WERE IN REALITY MERELY A PICKED SORT OF OLD SCOTCH OR HIGHLAND TERRIER SIR PAYNTON HIMSELF AS APPEARS FROM THE COLUMNS OF THE LIVE STOCK JOURNAL MARCH SECOND EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN BOUGHT SOME OF THE STRAIN OF VAN BUST
4243-14929-0015 AND THEREIN GIVES A FULL DESCRIPTION OF THE SAME SIR PAYNTON PIGOTT'S KENNEL OF THE BREED ASSUMED QUITE LARGE PROPORTIONS AND WAS MOST SUCCESSFUL SEVERAL TIMES WINNING ALL THE PRIZES OFFERED IN THE VARIETY AT DIFFERENT SHOWS
4243-14929-0016 HE MAY WELL BE CALLED THE FATHER OF THE BREED IN ENGLAND FOR WHEN HE GAVE UP EXHIBITING A GREAT DEAL OF HIS BEST BLOOD GOT INTO THE KENNELS OF MISTER H J LUDLOW WHO AS EVERYONE KNOWS HAS DONE SUCH A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF GOOD IN POPULARISING THE BREED
4243-14929-0017 AND HAS ALSO HIMSELF PRODUCED SUCH A GALAXY OF SPECIMENS OF THE VERY BEST CLASS MISTER LUDLOW'S FIRST TERRIER WAS A BITCH CALLED SPLINTER TWO THE NAME OF KILDEE IS IN THE BREED ALMOST WORLD FAMOUS
4243-14929-0018 AND IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT IN EVERY LINE DOES HE GO BACK TO THE SAID SPLINTER TWO RAMBLER CALLED BY THE GREAT AUTHORITIES THE FIRST PILLAR OF THE STUD BOOK WAS A SON OF A DOG CALLED BON ACCORD AND IT IS TO THIS LATTER DOG AND ROGER ROUGH
4243-14929-0019 AND ALSO THE AFORESAID TARTAN AND SPLINTER TWO THAT NEARLY ALL OF THE BEST PRESENT DAY PEDIGREES GO BACK THIS BEING SO IT IS UNNECESSARY TO GIVE MANY MORE NAMES OF DOGS WHO HAVE IN THEIR GENERATIONS OF SOME YEARS BACK ASSISTED IN BRINGING THE BREED TO ITS PRESENT STATE OF PERFECTION
4243-14929-0020 AND SOME VERY GOOD TERRIERS OF TO DAY OWN HIM AS PROGENITOR IN NEARLY EVERY LINE THE BEST DESCENDANTS OF ALISTER WERE KILDEE TIREE WHINSTONE PRINCE ALEXANDER AND HEATHER PRINCE HE WAS APPARENTLY TOO MUCH INBRED TO
4243-14929-0021 AND THOUGH HE PRODUCED OR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SEVERAL BEAUTIFUL TERRIERS IT IS MUCH TO BE DOUBTED WHETHER IN A BREED WHICH IS SUFFERING FROM THE ILL EFFECTS OF TOO MUCH INBREEDING HE WAS NOT ONE OF THE GREATEST SINNERS THE SCOTTISH TERRIER CLUB WAS FORMED IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO
4243-14929-0022 IN THE SAME YEAR A JOINT COMMITTEE DREW UP A STANDARD OF PERFECTION FOR THE BREED MESSRS J B MORISON AND THOMSON GRAY TWO GENTLEMEN WHO WERE LOOKED UPON AS GREAT AUTHORITIES HAVING A GOOD DEAL TO DO WITH IT
4243-14929-0023 SKULL PROPORTIONATELY LONG SLIGHTLY DOMED AND COVERED WITH SHORT HARD HAIR
4243-14929-0024 THOUGH THE NOSE PROJECTS SOMEWHAT OVER THE MOUTH WHICH GIVES THE IMPRESSION OF THE UPPER JAW BEING LONGER THAN THE UNDER ONE EYES A DARK BROWN OR HAZEL COLOUR SMALL PIERCING VERY BRIGHT AND RATHER SUNKEN EARS VERY SMALL
4243-14929-0025 PRICK OR HALF PRICK THE FORMER IS PREFERABLE BUT NEVER DROP THEY SHOULD ALSO BE SHARP POINTED AND THE HAIR ON THEM SHOULD NOT BE LONG BUT VELVETY AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE CUT THE EARS SHOULD BE FREE FROM ANY FRINGE AT THE TOP NECK SHORT THICK AND MUSCULAR
4243-14929-0026 AND EXCEEDINGLY STRONG IN HIND QUARTERS LEGS AND FEET BOTH FORE AND HIND LEGS SHOULD BE SHORT AND VERY HEAVY IN BONE THE FORMER BEING STRAIGHT AND WELL SET ON UNDER THE BODY AS THE SCOTTISH TERRIER SHOULD NOT BE OUT AT ELBOWS THE HOCKS SHOULD BE BENT
4243-14929-0027 AND THE THIGHS VERY MUSCULAR AND THE FEET STRONG SMALL AND THICKLY COVERED WITH SHORT HAIR THE FORE FEET BEING LARGER THAN THE HIND ONES TAIL SHOULD BE ABOUT SEVEN INCHES LONG NEVER DOCKED CARRIED WITH A SLIGHT BEND AND OFTEN GAILY COAT
4243-14929-0028 SIZE FROM FIFTEEN POUNDS TO TWENTY POUNDS THE BEST WEIGHT BEING AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE EIGHTEEN POUNDS FOR DOGS AND SIXTEEN POUNDS FOR BITCHES WHEN IN CONDITION FOR WORK COLOUR STEEL OR IRON GREY BLACK BRINDLE BROWN BRINDLE
4243-14929-0029 GREY BRINDLE BLACK SANDY AND WHEATEN WHITE MARKINGS ARE OBJECTIONABLE AND CAN ONLY BE ALLOWED ON THE CHEST AND TO A SMALL EXTENT GENERAL APPEARANCE THE FACE SHOULD WEAR A VERY SHARP BRIGHT AND ACTIVE EXPRESSION
4243-14929-0030 AND THE HEAD SHOULD BE CARRIED UP THE DOG OWING TO THE SHORTNESS OF HIS COAT SHOULD APPEAR TO BE HIGHER ON THE LEG THAN HE REALLY IS BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE SHOULD LOOK COMPACT AND POSSESSED OF GREAT MUSCLE IN HIS HIND QUARTERS
4243-14929-0031 IN FACT A SCOTTISH TERRIER THOUGH ESSENTIALLY A TERRIER CANNOT BE TOO POWERFULLY PUT TOGETHER AND SHOULD BE FROM ABOUT NINE INCHES TO TWELVE INCHES IN HEIGHT SPECIAL FAULTS MUZZLE EITHER UNDER OR OVER HUNG EYES LARGE OR LIGHT COLOURED
4243-14929-0032 EARS LARGE ROUND AT THE POINTS OR DROP IT IS ALSO A FAULT IF THEY ARE TOO HEAVILY COVERED WITH HAIR LEGS BENT OR SLIGHTLY BENT AND OUT AT ELBOWS COAT ANY SILKINESS WAVE OR TENDENCY TO CURL
4243-14929-0033 IS A SERIOUS BLEMISH AS IS ALSO AN OPEN COAT SIZE
4243-14929-0034 THERE HAVE OF RECENT YEARS BEEN MANY VERY EXCELLENT SPECIMENS OF THE SCOTTISH TERRIER BRED AND EXHIBITED PREEMINENT AMONG THEM STANDS MISSUS HANNAY'S
4243-14929-0035 WHO WAS A MOST SYMMETRICAL TERRIER AND PROBABLY THE NEAREST APPROACH TO PERFECTION IN THE BREED YET SEEN
4243-14929-0036 MISTER MC CANDLISH'S EMS COSMETIC MISTER CHAPMAN'S HEATHER BOB AND HEATHER CHARM MISTER KINNEAR'S SEAFIELD RASCAL
4243-14929-0037 IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT OF ALL THE TERRIER TRIBE THE SCOTTIE TAKEN AS A WHOLE IS THE BEST COMPANION HE MAKES A MOST EXCELLENT HOUSE DOG IS NOT TOO BIG DOES NOT LEAVE WHITE HAIRS ABOUT ALL OVER THE PLACE LOVES ONLY HIS MASTER AND HIS MASTER'S HOUSEHOLD
4243-14929-0038 AND IS WITHAL A CAPABLE AND RELIABLE GUARD
