6696-73295-0000 THEY ALWAYS BEHAVE VERY WELL TO ME OH THEY GIVE THEMSELVES SUCH AIRS THEY ARE THE MOST CONCEITED CREATURES IN THE WORLD AND THINK THEMSELVES OF SO MUCH IMPORTANCE BY THE BY THOUGH I HAVE THOUGHT OF IT A HUNDRED TIMES I HAVE ALWAYS FORGOT TO ASK YOU
6696-73295-0001 WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE COMPLEXION IN A MAN DO YOU LIKE THEM BEST DARK OR FAIR I HARDLY KNOW I NEVER MUCH THOUGHT ABOUT IT SOMETHING BETWEEN BOTH I THINK BROWN NOT FAIR AND NOT VERY DARK
6696-73295-0002 THEY WILL HARDLY FOLLOW US THERE AWAY THEY WALKED TO THE BOOK AND WHILE ISABELLA EXAMINED THE NAMES IT WAS CATHERINE'S EMPLOYMENT TO WATCH THE PROCEEDINGS OF THESE ALARMING YOUNG MEN
6696-73295-0003 I HOPE THEY ARE NOT SO IMPERTINENT AS TO FOLLOW US PRAY LET ME KNOW IF THEY ARE COMING I AM DETERMINED I WILL NOT LOOK UP IN A FEW MOMENTS CATHERINE WITH UNAFFECTED PLEASURE ASSURED HER THAT SHE NEED NOT BE LONGER UNEASY
6696-73295-0004 AS THE GENTLEMEN HAD JUST LEFT THE PUMP ROOM AND WHICH WAY ARE THEY GONE SAID ISABELLA TURNING HASTILY ROUND ONE WAS A VERY GOOD LOOKING YOUNG MAN THEY WENT TOWARDS THE CHURCHYARD WELL I AM AMAZINGLY GLAD I HAVE GOT RID OF THEM
6696-73295-0005 YOU SAID YOU SHOULD LIKE TO SEE IT CATHERINE READILY AGREED
6696-73295-0006 I SHALL NOT PAY THEM ANY SUCH COMPLIMENT I ASSURE YOU
6696-73295-0007 THAT IS THE WAY TO SPOIL THEM CATHERINE HAD NOTHING TO OPPOSE AGAINST SUCH REASONING AND THEREFORE TO SHOW THE INDEPENDENCE OF MISS THORPE AND HER RESOLUTION OF HUMBLING THE SEX THEY SET OFF IMMEDIATELY AS FAST AS THEY COULD WALK IN PURSUIT OF THE TWO YOUNG MEN
6696-73295-0008 HALF A MINUTE CONDUCTED THEM THROUGH THE PUMP YARD TO THE ARCHWAY OPPOSITE UNION PASSAGE BUT HERE THEY WERE STOPPED EVERYBODY ACQUAINTED WITH BATH MAY REMEMBER THE DIFFICULTIES OF CROSSING CHEAP STREET AT THIS POINT IT IS INDEED A STREET OF SO IMPERTINENT A NATURE
6696-73295-0009 SO UNFORTUNATELY CONNECTED WITH THE GREAT LONDON AND OXFORD ROADS AND THE PRINCIPAL INN OF THE CITY THAT A DAY NEVER PASSES IN WHICH PARTIES OF LADIES HOWEVER IMPORTANT THEIR BUSINESS WHETHER IN QUEST OF PASTRY MILLINERY OR EVEN AS IN THE PRESENT CASE OF YOUNG MEN
6696-73295-0010 ARE NOT DETAINED ON ONE SIDE OR OTHER BY CARRIAGES HORSEMEN OR CARTS THIS EVIL HAD BEEN FELT AND LAMENTED AT LEAST THREE TIMES A DAY BY ISABELLA SINCE HER RESIDENCE IN BATH AND SHE WAS NOW FATED TO FEEL AND LAMENT IT ONCE MORE
6696-73295-0011 FOR AT THE VERY MOMENT OF COMING OPPOSITE TO UNION PASSAGE AND WITHIN VIEW OF THE TWO GENTLEMEN WHO WERE PROCEEDING THROUGH THE CROWDS AND TREADING THE GUTTERS OF THAT INTERESTING ALLEY THEY WERE PREVENTED CROSSING BY THE APPROACH OF A GIG
6696-73295-0012 DRIVEN ALONG ON BAD PAVEMENTS BY A MOST KNOWING LOOKING COACHMAN WITH ALL THE VEHEMENCE THAT COULD MOST FITLY ENDANGER THE LIVES OF HIMSELF HIS COMPANION AND HIS HORSE OH THESE ODIOUS GIGS SAID ISABELLA LOOKING UP HOW I DETEST THEM
6696-73295-0013 BUT THIS DETESTATION THOUGH SO JUST WAS OF SHORT DURATION FOR SHE LOOKED AGAIN AND EXCLAIMED DELIGHTFUL MISTER MORLAND AND MY BROTHER GOOD HEAVEN TIS JAMES WAS UTTERED AT THE SAME MOMENT BY CATHERINE
6696-73295-0014 THE HORSE WAS IMMEDIATELY CHECKED WITH A VIOLENCE WHICH ALMOST THREW HIM ON HIS HAUNCHES AND THE SERVANT HAVING NOW SCAMPERED UP THE GENTLEMEN JUMPED OUT
6696-73295-0015 CATHERINE BY WHOM THIS MEETING WAS WHOLLY UNEXPECTED RECEIVED HER BROTHER WITH THE LIVELIEST PLEASURE AND HE BEING OF A VERY AMIABLE DISPOSITION AND SINCERELY ATTACHED TO HER GAVE EVERY PROOF ON HIS SIDE OF EQUAL SATISFACTION
6696-73295-0016 WHICH HE COULD HAVE LEISURE TO DO WHILE THE BRIGHT EYES OF MISS THORPE WERE INCESSANTLY CHALLENGING HIS NOTICE AND TO HER HIS DEVOIRS WERE SPEEDILY PAID WITH A MIXTURE OF JOY AND EMBARRASSMENT
6696-73295-0017 WHICH MIGHT HAVE INFORMED CATHERINE HAD SHE BEEN MORE EXPERT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S FEELINGS AND LESS SIMPLY ENGROSSED BY HER OWN
6696-73295-0018 THAT HER BROTHER THOUGHT HER FRIEND QUITE AS PRETTY AS SHE COULD DO HERSELF JOHN THORPE WHO IN THE MEAN TIME HAD BEEN GIVING ORDERS ABOUT THE HORSE SOON JOINED THEM AND FROM HIM SHE DIRECTLY RECEIVED THE AMENDS WHICH WERE HER DUE FOR WHILE HE SLIGHTLY AND CARELESSLY TOUCHED THE HAND OF ISABELLA
6696-73295-0019 ON HER HE BESTOWED A WHOLE SCRAPE AND HALF A SHORT BOW HE WAS A STOUT YOUNG MAN OF MIDDLING HEIGHT WHO WITH A PLAIN FACE AND UNGRACEFUL FORM SEEMED FEARFUL OF BEING TOO HANDSOME UNLESS HE WORE THE DRESS OF A GROOM AND TOO MUCH LIKE A GENTLEMAN
6696-73295-0020 UNLESS HE WERE EASY WHERE HE OUGHT TO BE CIVIL AND IMPUDENT WHERE HE MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO BE EASY HE TOOK OUT HIS WATCH HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING IN FROM TETBURY MISS MORLAND I DO NOT KNOW THE DISTANCE
6696-73295-0021 MORLAND REMONSTRATED PLEADED THE AUTHORITY OF ROAD BOOKS INNKEEPERS AND MILESTONES BUT HIS FRIEND DISREGARDED THEM ALL HE HAD A SURER TEST OF DISTANCE I KNOW IT MUST BE FIVE AND TWENTY SAID HE BY THE TIME WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT
6696-73295-0022 IT IS NOW HALF AFTER ONE WE DROVE OUT OF THE INN YARD AT TETBURY
6696-73295-0023 THAT MAKES IT EXACTLY TWENTY FIVE YOU HAVE LOST AN HOUR SAID MORLAND IT WAS ONLY TEN O'CLOCK WHEN WE CAME FROM TETBURY TEN O'CLOCK IT WAS ELEVEN UPON MY SOUL I COUNTED EVERY STROKE
6696-73295-0024 THIS BROTHER OF YOURS WOULD PERSUADE ME OUT OF MY SENSES MISS MORLAND DO BUT LOOK AT MY HORSE DID YOU EVER SEE AN ANIMAL SO MADE FOR SPEED IN YOUR LIFE THE SERVANT HAD JUST MOUNTED THE CARRIAGE AND WAS DRIVING OFF SUCH TRUE BLOOD
6696-73295-0025 THREE HOURS AND A HALF INDEED COMING ONLY THREE AND TWENTY MILES LOOK AT THAT CREATURE AND SUPPOSE IT POSSIBLE IF YOU CAN HE DOES LOOK VERY HOT TO BE SURE HOT HE HAD NOT TURNED A HAIR TILL WE CAME TO WALCOT CHURCH
6696-73295-0026 BUT LOOK AT HIS FOREHAND LOOK AT HIS LOINS ONLY SEE HOW HE MOVES THAT HORSE CANNOT GO LESS THAN TEN MILES AN HOUR TIE HIS LEGS AND HE WILL GET ON
6696-73295-0027 WELL HUNG TOWN BUILT I HAVE NOT HAD IT A MONTH IT WAS BUILT FOR A CHRIST CHURCH MAN A FRIEND OF MINE A VERY GOOD SORT OF FELLOW HE RAN IT A FEW WEEKS TILL I BELIEVE IT WAS CONVENIENT TO HAVE DONE WITH IT
6696-73295-0028 IT IS A CAPITAL ONE OF THE KIND BUT I AM CURSED TIRED OF IT
6696-73295-0029 WHAT DO YOU ASK AND HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK HE DID MISS MORLAND I AM SURE I CANNOT GUESS AT ALL CURRICLE HUNG YOU SEE SEAT TRUNK SWORD CASE SPLASHING BOARD LAMPS SILVER MOLDING ALL YOU SEE COMPLETE
6696-73295-0030 THAT THOUGH THEY OVERTOOK AND PASSED THE TWO OFFENDING YOUNG MEN IN MILSOM STREET SHE WAS SO FAR FROM SEEKING TO ATTRACT THEIR NOTICE THAT SHE LOOKED BACK AT THEM ONLY THREE TIMES JOHN THORPE KEPT OF COURSE WITH CATHERINE
6696-73295-0031 AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES SILENCE RENEWED THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HIS GIG YOU WILL FIND HOWEVER MISS MORLAND IT WOULD BE RECKONED A CHEAP THING BY SOME PEOPLE FOR I MIGHT HAVE SOLD IT FOR TEN GUINEAS MORE THE NEXT DAY
6696-73295-0032 ARE YOU FOND OF AN OPEN CARRIAGE MISS MORLAND YES VERY I HAVE HARDLY EVER AN OPPORTUNITY OF BEING IN ONE BUT I AM PARTICULARLY FOND OF IT I AM GLAD OF IT I WILL DRIVE YOU OUT IN MINE EVERY DAY
6696-73295-0033 THANK YOU SAID CATHERINE IN SOME DISTRESS FROM A DOUBT OF THE PROPRIETY OF ACCEPTING SUCH AN OFFER I WILL DRIVE YOU UP LANSDOWN HILL TO MORROW THANK YOU BUT WILL NOT YOUR HORSE WANT REST REST

6696-73295-0035 SAID CATHERINE VERY SERIOUSLY THAT WILL BE FORTY MILES A DAY FORTY AY FIFTY FOR WHAT I CARE
6696-73295-0036 TO NOTHING MORE THAN A SHORT DECISIVE SENTENCE OF PRAISE OR CONDEMNATION ON THE FACE OF EVERY WOMEN THEY MET AND CATHERINE AFTER LISTENING AND AGREEING AS LONG AS SHE COULD WITH ALL THE CIVILITY AND DEFERENCE OF THE YOUTHFUL FEMALE MIND
6696-73295-0037 HAVE YOU EVER READ UDOLPHO MISTER THORPE UDOLPHO O LORD NOT I I NEVER READ NOVELS I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO DO CATHERINE HUMBLED AND ASHAMED WAS GOING TO APOLOGIZE FOR HER QUESTION
6696-73295-0038 I THINK YOU MUST LIKE UDOLPHO IF YOU WERE TO READ IT IT IS SO VERY INTERESTING NOT I FAITH
6696-73295-0039 UDOLPHO WAS WRITTEN BY MISSUS RADCLIFFE SAID CATHERINE WITH SOME HESITATION FROM THE FEAR OF MORTIFYING HIM NO SURE WAS IT
6696-73295-0040 I WAS THINKING OF THAT OTHER STUPID BOOK WRITTEN BY THAT WOMAN THEY MADE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT SHE WHO MARRIED THE FRENCH EMIGRANT I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN CAMILLA YES THAT'S THE BOOK SUCH UNNATURAL STUFF
6696-73295-0041 THIS CRITIQUE THE JUSTNESS OF WHICH WAS UNFORTUNATELY LOST ON POOR CATHERINE BROUGHT THEM TO THE DOOR OF MISSUS THORPE'S LODGINGS AND THE FEELINGS OF THE DISCERNING AND UNPREJUDICED READER OF CAMILLA GAVE WAY TO THE FEELINGS OF THE DUTIFUL AND AFFECTIONATE SON
6696-73295-0042 AS THEY MET MISSUS THORPE WHO HAD DESCRIED THEM FROM ABOVE IN THE PASSAGE AH MOTHER HOW DO YOU DO SAID HE GIVING HER A HEARTY SHAKE OF THE HAND
6696-73295-0043 IT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE AN OLD WITCH HERE IS MORLAND AND I COME TO STAY A FEW DAYS WITH YOU SO YOU MUST LOOK OUT FOR A COUPLE OF GOOD BEDS SOMEWHERE NEAR AND THIS ADDRESS SEEMED TO SATISFY ALL THE FONDEST WISHES OF THE MOTHER'S HEART
