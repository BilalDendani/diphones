7538-100044-0000 UNDERSTAND SAID TOM I DON'T WANT TO INTERFERE UNLESS I AM CONVINCED THAT ANDY IS TRYING AN UNDERHAND TRICK MY PLANS ARE MISSING AND I THINK HE TOOK THEM IF HIS MACHINE IS MADE AFTER THOSE PLANS IT IS OBVIOUSLY A STEAL AND I WANT HIM RULED OUT OF THE MEET
7538-100044-0001 AND SO HE SHALL BE EXCLAIMED MISTER SHARP GET THE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM AND WE'LL ACT QUICKLY ENOUGH THE COMMITTEE MET IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND CONSIDERED THE CASE MEANWHILE TOM AND MISTER DAMON STROLLED PAST THE TENT WITH ITS FLARING SIGN
7538-100044-0002 THERE WAS A MAN ON GUARD BUT ANDY WAS NOT IN SIGHT THEN TOM WAS SENT FOR AND MISTER SHARP TOLD HIM WHAT CONCLUSION HAD BEEN ARRIVED AT IT WAS THIS
7538-100044-0003 THAT IS THEY NEED NOT BRING THEM OUT UNTIL JUST BEFORE THE RACES HE ADDED THIS IS NOT A HANDICAP AFFAIR AND THE SPEEDIEST MACHINE OR THE ONE THAT GOES TO THE GREATEST HEIGHT ACCORDING TO WHICH CLASS IT ENTERS WILL WIN
7538-100044-0004 IN CONSEQUENCE WE CANNOT FORCE ANY CONTESTANT TO DECLARE WHAT KIND OF A MACHINE HE WILL USE UNTIL HE GETS READY SOME ARE GOING TO USE THE FAMILIAR TYPE OF BIPLANES AND AS YOU CAN SEE THERE IS NO SECRET ABOUT THEM THEY ARE TRYING THEM OUT NOW THIS WAS SO
7538-100044-0005 FOR SEVERAL MACHINES OF THIS TYPE WERE EITHER IN THE AIR CIRCLING ABOUT OR WERE BEING RUN OVER THE GROUND BUT OTHERS CONTINUED MISTER SHARP WILL NOT EVEN TAKE THE COMMITTEE INTO THEIR CONFIDENCE UNTIL JUST BEFORE THE RACE THEY WANT TO KEEP THEIR CRAFT A SECRET WE CAN'T COMPEL THEM TO DO OTHERWISE
7538-100044-0006 I'M SORRY TOM BUT THE ONLY THING I SEE FOR YOU TO DO IS TO WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE THEN IF YOU FIND ANDY HAS INFRINGED ON YOUR MACHINE LODGE A PROTEST THAT IS UNLESS YOU CAN GET EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM BEFORE THAT TIME TOM WELL KNEW THE USELESSNESS OF THE LATTER PLAN
7538-100044-0007 HE AND MISTER DAMON HAD TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THE CRAFT ANDY HAD MADE BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS AS TO THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE THAT OF WAITING UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT TOM FEARED THAT TOO WOULD BE FUTILE FOR HE REASONED
7538-100044-0008 JUST BEFORE THE RACE THERE WILL BE A LOT OF CONFUSION OFFICIALS WILL BE HERE AND THERE SCATTERED OVER THE GROUND THEY WILL BE HARD TO FIND AND IT WILL BE ALMOST USELESS TO PROTEST THEN ANDY WILL ENTER THE RACE AND THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT HE MAY WIN ALMOST ANY ONE COULD WITH A MACHINE LIKE THE HUMMING BIRD
7538-100044-0009 THAT WOULD BE LITTLE GOOD IN CASE ANDY BEAT ME THE PUBLIC WOULD SAY I WAS A SOREHEAD AND JEALOUS NO I'VE EITHER GOT TO STOP ANDY BEFORE THE RACE OR NOT AT ALL I WILL TRY TO THINK OF A PLAN TOM DID THINK OF SEVERAL BUT ABANDONED THEM ONE AFTER THE OTHER
7538-100044-0010 HE TRIED TO GET A GLIMPSE INSIDE THE TENT WHERE THE FOGER AEROPLANE WAS HOUSED BUT IT WAS TOO CLOSELY GUARDED ANDY HIMSELF WAS NOT MUCH IN EVIDENCE AND TOM ONLY HAD FLEETING GLIMPSES OF THE BULLY MEANWHILE HE AND MISTER DAMON TOGETHER WITH THEIR MACHINIST WERE KEPT BUSY
7538-100044-0011 AS TOM'S CRAFT WAS FULLY PROTECTED BY PATENTS NOW HE HAD NO HESITATION IN TAKING IT OUT AND IT WAS GIVEN SEVERAL SEVERE TESTS AROUND THE AERIAL COURSE IT DID EVEN BETTER THAN TOM EXPECTED OF IT AND HE HAD GREAT HOPES ALWAYS THOUGH
7538-100044-0012 THERE WERE TWO THINGS THAT WORRIED HIM ONE WAS HIS FATHER'S ILLNESS AND THE OTHER THE UNEASINESS HE FELT AS TO WHAT ANDY FOGER MIGHT DO AS TO THE FORMER THE WIRELESS REPORTS INDICATED THAT MISTER SWIFT WAS DOING AS WELL AS COULD BE EXPECTED BUT HIS IMPROVEMENT WAS NOT RAPID
7538-100044-0013 REGARDING THE LATTER WORRY TOM SAW NO WAY OF GETTING RID OF IT I'VE JUST GOT TO WAIT THAT'S ALL HE THOUGHT THE DAY BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE MEET TOM AND MISTER DAMON HAD GIVEN THE HUMMING BIRD A GRUELING TRYOUT THEY HAD TAKEN HER HIGH UP
7538-100044-0014 SO HIGH THAT NO PRYING EYES COULD TIME THEM AND THERE TOM HAD OPENED THE MOTOR FOR ALL THE POWER IN IT THEY HAD FLASHED THROUGH SPACE AT THE RATE OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES AN HOUR IF WE CAN ONLY DO THAT IN THE RACE THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IS MINE EXULTED TOM
7538-100044-0015 AS HE SLANTED THE NOSE OF THE AEROPLANE TOWARD THE EARTH THE DAY OF THE RACE DAWNED CLEAR AND BEAUTIFUL TOM WAS UP EARLY FOR THERE REMAINED MANY LITTLE THINGS TO DO TO GET HIS CRAFT IN FINAL TRIM FOR THE CONTEST THEN TOO
7538-100044-0016 HE WANTED TO BE READY TO ACT PROMPTLY AS SOON AS ANDY'S MACHINE WAS WHEELED OUT AND HE ALSO WANTED TO GET A MESSAGE FROM HOME THE WIRELESS ARRIVED SOON AFTER BREAKFAST AND DID NOT CONTAIN VERY CHEERING NEWS
7538-100044-0017 POOR NIGHT BUT DOCTOR THINKS DAY WILL SHOW IMPROVEMENT DON'T WORRY DON'T WORRY I WONDER WHO COULD HELP IT MUSED POOR TOM WELL I'LL HOPE FOR THE BEST AND HE WIRED BACK TO TELL THE ENGINEER IN SHOPTON TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH HIM
7538-100044-0018 AND TO FLASH THE MESSAGES TO THE HUMMING BIRD IN THE AIR AFTER THE BIG RACE STARTED NOW I'LL GO OUT AND SEE IF I CAN CATCH A GLIMPSE OF WHAT THAT SNEAK ANDY HAS TO PIT AGAINST ME SAID TOM THE FOGER TENT WAS TIGHTLY CLOSED AND TOM TURNED BACK TO HIS OWN PLACE
7538-100044-0019 HAVING ARRANGED WITH A MESSENGER TO COME AND LET HIM KNOW AS SOON AS ANDY'S CRAFT WAS WHEELED OUT ALL ABOUT WAS A SCENE OF GREAT ACTIVITY THE GRAND STANDS WERE FILLED AND A BIG CROWD STOOD ABOUT THE FIELD ANXIOUSLY WAITING FOR THE FIRST SIGHT OF THE BIRD MEN IN THEIR WONDERFUL MACHINES
7538-100044-0020 NOW AND THEN THE BAND BLARED OUT AND CHEERS AROSE AS ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE FRAIL CRAFT WERE WHEELED TO THE STARTING PLACE MEN IN QUEER LEATHER COSTUMES DARTED HERE AND THERE THEY WERE THE AVIATORS WHO WERE SOON TO RISK LIFE AND LIMB FOR GLORY AND GOLD
7538-100044-0021 MOST OF THEM WERE NERVOUSLY SMOKING CIGARETTES THE AIR WAS FILLED WITH GUTTURAL GERMAN OR NASAL FRENCH WHILE NOW AND THEN THE STACCATO RUSSIAN WAS HEARD AND OCCASIONALLY THE LIQUID TONES OF A JAPANESE FOR MEN OF MANY NATIONS WERE COMPETING FOR THE PRIZES
7538-100044-0022 THE MAJORITY OF THE MACHINES WERE MONOPLANES AND BIPLANES THOUGH ONE TRIPLANE WAS ENTERED AND THERE WERE SEVERAL FREAKS AS THE BIPLANE AND MONOPLANE MEN CALLED THEM CRAFT OF THE HELICOPTER OR THE WHEEL TYPE THERE WAS ALSO ONE WITZIG LIORE DUTILLEUL BIPLANE
7538-100044-0023 WITH THREE PLANES BEHIND TOM WAS FAMILIAR WITH MOST OF THESE TYPES BUT OCCASIONALLY HE SAW A NEW ONE THAT EXCITED HIS CURIOSITY HOWEVER HE WAS MORE INTERESTED IN WHAT ANDY FOGER WOULD TURN OUT ANDY'S MACHINE HAD NOT BEEN TRIED AND TOM WONDERED HOW HE DARED RISK FLYING IN IT
7538-100044-0024 TOM AND MISTER DAMON HAD WHEELED THE HUMMING BIRD OUT OF HER CANVAS NEST THERE WAS A CHEER AS THE CROWD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE TRIM LITTLE CRAFT THE YOUNG INVENTOR THE ECCENTRIC MAN AND THE MACHINIST WERE BUSY GOING OVER EVERY PART MEANWHILE
7538-100044-0025 THE MEET HAD BEEN OFFICIALLY OPENED AND IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE PRELIMINARY EVENT WOULD BE SOME AIR EVOLUTIONS AT NO GREAT HEIGHT AND FOR NO PARTICULAR PRIZE SEVERAL BIPLANES AND MONOPLANES TOOK PART IN THIS IT WAS VERY INTERESTING
7538-100044-0026 BUT HE ONLY LAUGHED AT THAT AND COOLLY DEMANDED ANOTHER CIGARETTE AS HE CRAWLED OUT OF THE TANGLE OF WIRES PLANES AND THE MOTOR AFTER THIS THERE WAS AN EXHIBITION FLIGHT BY A FRENCH AVIATOR IN A CURTIS BIPLANE WHO RACED AGAINST ONE IN A BABY WRIGHT
7538-100044-0027 IT WAS A DEAD HEAT ACCORDING TO THE JUDGES THEN CAME A FLIGHT FOR HEIGHT AND WHILE NO RECORDS WERE BROKEN THE CROWD WAS WELL SATISFIED
7538-100044-0028 TOM'S HEART GAVE A BOUND THERE WERE SEVEN ENTRANTS IN THIS CONTEST BESIDES TOM AND ANDY FOGER AND AS ANNOUNCED BY THE STARTER THEY WERE AS FOLLOWS CONTESTANT
7538-100044-0029 ALAMEDA ANTOINETTE MONOPLANE PERIQUE BLERIOT MONOPLANE LOI TONG SANTOS DUMONT MONOPLANE WENDELL CURTIS BIPLANE DE TROMP FARMAN BIPLANE
7538-100044-0030 TOM SWIFT HUMMING BIRD MONOPLANE WHAT IS THE STYLE OF THE FOGER MACHINE YELLED SOME ONE IN THE CROWD AS THE ANNOUNCER LOWERED HIS MEGAPHONE IT HAS NOT BEEN ANNOUNCED WAS THE REPLY IT WILL AT ONCE BE WHEELED OUT THOUGH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONDITIONS OF THE RACE
7538-100044-0031 THERE WAS A CRANING OF NECKS AND AN UNEASY MOVEMENT IN THE CROWD FOR TOM'S STORY WAS NOW GENERALLY KNOWN GET READY TO MAKE YOUR PROTEST ADVISED MISTER DAMON TO THE YOUNG INVENTOR I'LL STAY BY THE MACHINE HERE UNTIL YOU COME BACK BLESS MY RADIATOR
7538-100044-0032 THE FLAPS WERE PULLED BACK AND A CURIOUS MACHINE WAS WHEELED INTO VIEW TOM RUSHED OVER TOWARD IT INTENT ON GETTING THE FIRST VIEW WOULD IT PROVE TO BE A COPY OF HIS SPEEDY HUMMING BIRD EAGERLY HE LOOKED BUT A CURIOUS SIGHT MET HIS EYES
7538-100044-0033 THE MACHINE WAS TOTALLY UNLIKE ANY HE HAD EXPECTED TO SEE IT WAS LARGE AND TO HIS MIND RATHER CLUMSY BUT IT LOOKED POWERFUL THEN AS HE TOOK IN THE DETAILS HE KNEW THAT IT WAS THE SAME ONE THAT HAD FLOWN OVER HIS HOUSE THAT NIGHT IT WAS THE ONE FROM WHICH THE FIRE BOMB HAD BEEN DROPPED
7538-100044-0034 HE PUSHED HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD HE SAW ANDY STANDING NEAR THE CURIOUS BIPLANE WHICH TYPE OF AIR CRAFT IT NEAREST RESEMBLED THOUGH IT HAD SOME MONOPLANE FEATURES ON THE SIDE WAS PAINTED THE NAME SLUGGER ANDY CAUGHT SIGHT OF TOM SWIFT
7538-100044-0035 I'M GOING TO BEAT YOU THE BULLY BOASTED AND I HAVEN'T A MACHINE LIKE YOURS AFTER ALL YOU WERE WRONG SO I SEE STAMMERED TOM HARDLY KNOWING WHAT TO THINK
7538-100044-0036 LIKE ALL THE OTHERS HIS MACHINE HAD TWO SEATS FOR IN THIS RACE EACH OPERATOR MUST CARRY A PASSENGER TOM TURNED AWAY BOTH GLAD AND SORRY GLAD THAT HIS RIVAL WAS NOT TO RACE HIM IN A DUPLICATE OF THE HUMMING BIRD BUT SORRY THAT HE HAD AS YET NO TRACK OF THE STRANGELY MISSING PLANS
7538-100044-0037 I WONDER WHERE THEY CAN BE MUSED THE YOUNG INVENTOR THEN CAME THE FIRING OF THE PRELIMINARY GUN TOM RUSHED BACK TO WHERE MISTER DAMON STOOD WAITING FOR HIM THERE WAS A LAST LOOK AT THE HUMMING BIRD SHE WAS FIT TO RACE ANY MACHINE ON THE GROUND
7538-100044-0038 MISTER DAMON TOOK HIS PLACE TOM STARTED THE PROPELLER THE OTHER CONTESTANTS WERE IN THEIR SEATS WITH THEIR PASSENGERS THEIR ASSISTANTS STOOD READY TO SHOVE THEM OFF THE EXPLOSIONS OF SO MANY MOTORS IN ACTION WERE DEAFENING HOW MUCH THRUST CRIED TOM TO HIS MACHINIST
7538-100044-0039 TWENTY TWO HUNDRED POUNDS GOOD THE REPORT OF THE STARTING GUN COULD NOT BE HEARD BUT THE SMOKE OF IT LEAPED INTO THE AIR IT WAS THE SIGNAL TO GO TOM'S VOICE WOULD NOT HAVE CARRIED FIVE FEET HE WAVED HIS HANDS AS A SIGNAL
7538-100044-0040 HIS HELPER THRUST THE HUMMING BIRD FORWARD OVER THE SMOOTH GROUND IT RUSHED TOM LOOKED EAGERLY AHEAD ON A LINE WITH HIM WERE THE OTHER MACHINES INCLUDING ANDY FOGER'S SLUGGER TOM PULLED A LEVER HE FELT HIS CRAFT SOAR UPWARD THE OTHER MACHINES ALSO POINTED THEIR NOSES INTO THE AIR
