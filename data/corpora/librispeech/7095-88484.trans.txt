7095-88484-0000 CHAPTER SIX RELIGION AND SCIENCE SCIENCE THEN COMMANDS OUR RESPECT NOT ON THE BASIS THAT ITS PRESENT ASSUMPTIONS AND DEDUCTIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY AND FOR ALL TIME TRUE
7095-88484-0001 BUT ON THE GROUND THAT ITS METHOD IS FOR ALL TIME TRUE THE METHOD OF DISCOVERY THE METHOD OF OBSERVATION RESEARCH EXPERIMENTATION COMPARISON EXAMINATION TESTING
7095-88484-0002 AN UNREMITTING CRUSADE AGAINST IT THAT MUCH OF THIS CRUSADE HAD TURNED INTO A REAR GUARD ACTION WAS DUE LESS TO THE WEAKNESS OF THE DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH THAN TO THE INVULNERABILITY OF THEIR NON RESISTANT VICTIM
7095-88484-0003 AS IT DOES THOSE TRUTHS WHICH FORM ITS PROPER SUBJECT WE THEREFORE PRONOUNCE FALSE EVERY ASSERTION WHICH IS CONTRARY TO THE ENLIGHTENED TRUTH OF FAITH HENCE
7095-88484-0004 THAT ONE MAY BE ALLOWED TO HOLD TRUE THEIR ASSERTIONS EVEN WHEN OPPOSED TO REVEALED DOCTRINE CAN ANYTHING STRONGER BE SAID TO DISCOURAGE RESEARCH INVESTIGATION EXPERIMENT AND RETARD PROGRESS
7095-88484-0005 AND ONLY SIXTY YEARS AGO IT IS BUT THE RESTATEMENT OF WHAT THE CHURCH HAS UTTERED SO MANY TIMES AND FOR SO LONG THAT ALL KNOWLEDGE MATERIAL AS WELL AS SPIRITUAL IS TO BE FOUND IN THE BIBLE AS INTERPRETED BY THE CHURCH
7095-88484-0006 DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CHURCH WAS DOMINANT IT WAS THIS THAT HAD KILLED THE URGE TO SEARCH AND SEEK FOR THE TRUTH WHICH IS THE GOAL OF ALL SCIENCE THE MEANS BY WHICH HUMANITY IS SET ON THE ROAD TO PROGRESS
7095-88484-0007 THIS WAS THE DAMNABLE PRECEPT FOISTED ON THE MINDS OF MEN WHICH ENSLAVED THEM THROUGHOUT THE AGES AND FROM WHICH WE ARE JUST EMERGING THIS WAS THE PRECEPT
7095-88484-0008 TO RECONCILE SCIENCE WITH RELIGION ON THE ONE HAND THAT OF RELIGION WE HAVE THE FORCES OF INTOLERANCE SUPERSTITION AND THE ENDEAVOR TO BESMIRCH REPRESS AND RIDICULE
7095-88484-0009 SCIENCE ON THE OTHER HAND DOES NOT HESITATE TO TEAR DOWN OLD CONCEPTIONS AND HAS ONLY ONE MOTIVE THE ULTIMATE TRUTH RELIGION HAS THE PURPOSE
7095-88484-0010 OF KEEPING THE MASSES IN THE NARROW AND FALSE PATH OF ONLY ACCEPTED DOCTRINES THE TRUE SCIENTIST IS THE MAN WITH THE OPEN MIND ONE WHO WILL DISCARD THE WORTHLESS AND ACCEPT ONLY THE PROVEN GOOD THE RELIGIONIST
7095-88484-0011 CLOSES HIS MIND TO ALL FACTS WHICH HE IS UNWILLING TO BELIEVE EVERYTHING WHICH WILL ENDANGER HIS CREED RELIGION TEACHES THE INDIVIDUAL TO PLACE ALL HOPE ALL DESIRE IN A PROBLEMATICAL HEREAFTER
7095-88484-0012 THE STAY ON EARTH IS SO SHORT COMPARED TO THE EVERLASTING LIFE TO COME THAT OF WHAT INTEREST IS THIS LIFE ALL THINGS ARE VAIN THE MISERY THE SUFFERING OF HIS FELLOW MEN LEAVE HIM COLD
7095-88484-0013 IT IS NOT THAT SCIENCE HAS ATTAINED TRUE CONCLUSIONS NOT THAT THE EVIDENCE AT HAND MUST REMAIN IMMUTABLE BUT THAT THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD OF ANALYZING AND FORMULATING ASSUMPTIONS ON THE BASIS OF DISCOVERY ON ASCERTAINED FACTS
7095-88484-0014 IS A SUPERIOR METHOD TO THE CLOSED INFALLIBLE METHOD OF REVELATION THESE ASSUMPTIONS BASED UPON THE KNOWN FACTS LEAD TO A WORKING HYPOTHESIS WHICH IN TURN DEVELOPS INTO A THEORY
7095-88484-0015 SCIENCE WELCOMES THE CRITICAL ATTITUDE THAT LEADS TO THE REFINEMENT OF ITS THEORIES THERE MAY BE TODAY VARIOUS THEORIES HELD BY SCIENTISTS IN WHICH THEY ARE MISTAKEN BUT THE QUESTION OF THE METHOD BY WHICH THEY ARRIVE AT CONCLUSIONS
7095-88484-0016 CAN NO LONGER BE UNDER CONSIDERATION WITH REGARD TO ITS VALIDITY TO THE SCIENTIFIC MIND KNOWLEDGE IS SOMETHING TO BE ARRIVED AT BY STUDY AND RESEARCH TO THE RELIGIONIST KNOWLEDGE IS SOMETHING THAT IS CONTAINED
7095-88484-0017 IN AN INFALLIBLE AND SUPERNATURAL STATEMENT OR INSIGHT RELIGION EXALTS THE TRANSCENDENTAL SCIENCE MANIPULATES ONLY THE MATERIAL TO THE CONSISTENT RELIGIONIST
7095-88484-0018 HE WOULD DELUDE HIMSELF THAT HIS INNER CONVICTIONS GIVE HIM A FINALITY CONCERNING HIS EVOLVING ENVIRONMENT IT IS THEREFORE NOT SO MUCH SCIENCE THAT THE RELIGIONIST IS FIGHTING BUT THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD
7095-88484-0019 THIS SCIENTIFIC METHOD OF APPROACH HE RIGHTLY PERCEIVES HAS SO PERVADED OUR MODE OF THINKING THAT IT IS THE SUBTLE AND MOST DISINTEGRATING FORCE THAT IS SHATTERING THE RELIGIOUS FOUNDATIONS DOCTOR JAMES T SHOTWELL
7095-88484-0020 SPEAKING OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD CONCLUDES BUT WHATEVER STRICTURES PHILOSOPHY MAY PASS UPON THE CONCLUSIONS OF SCIENCE AS MERELY RELATIVE AND PROVISIONAL THERE IS NO CLEARER FACT IN THE HISTORY OF THOUGHT THAT ITS ATTITUDES AND METHODS
7095-88484-0021 HAVE BEEN AT OPPOSITE POLES FROM THOSE OF RELIGION IT DOES NO GOOD TO BLINK THE FACT ESTABLISHED AS IT IS BY THE MOST POSITIVE PROOFS OF HISTORY AND PSYCHOLOGY SCIENCE HAS MADE HEADWAY BY ATTEMPTING TO ELIMINATE MYSTERY SO FAR AS IT CAN
7095-88484-0022 RELIGION ON THE OTHER HAND HAS STRESSED MYSTERY AND ACCEPTED IT IN ITS OWN TERMS SCIENCE IS THE PRODUCT OF BOLD ADVENTURE PUSHING INTO THE REALM OF THE MYSTERIOUS TO INTERPRET ITS PHENOMENA IN TERMS OF THE INVESTIGATOR
7095-88484-0023 AND THE GLORY OF THE MORNING HILLS SCIENCE DOES NOT JUSTIFY BY FAITH BUT BY WORKS IT IS THE LIVING DENIAL OF THAT AGE LONG ACCEPTANCE WHICH WE ACCORD TO THE MYSTERY AS SUCH
7095-88484-0024 IT RENOUNCES AUTHORITY CUTS ATHWART CUSTOM VIOLATES THE SACRED REJECTS THE MYTHS IT ADJUSTS ITSELF TO THE PROCESS OF CHANGE WHOSE CREATIVE IMPULSE IT ITSELF SUPPLIES
7095-88484-0025 EACH DISCOVERY OF SOMETHING NEW INVOLVES THE DISCARDING OF SOMETHING OLD ABOVE ALL IT PROGRESSES BY DOUBTING RATHER THAN BY BELIEVING JAMES T SHOTWELL THE RELIGIOUS REVOLUTION OF TO DAY
7095-88484-0026 THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AN ADVANCE IN SCIENCE OF WIDESPREAD IMPORTANCE WHICH IN SOME MANNER OR OTHER ENDANGERED SOME MOULDY RELIGIOUS CONCEPT THAT THE CHURCH HAS NOT BITTERLY OPPOSED
7095-88484-0027 AN ADVANCE WHICH IN TIME HAS PROVEN OF INESTIMABLE BENEFIT FOR ALL MANKIND A GLANCE AT THE HISTORY OF HUMAN PROGRESS WILL REVEAL SCORES OF SUCH INSTANCES THE TWO RIVAL DIVISIONS OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH
7095-88484-0028 IT WAS THE DECREE OF THE LATERAN COUNCIL OF FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THAT ORDERED THAT NO BOOKS SHOULD BE PRINTED BUT SUCH AS HAD BEEN INSPECTED BY THE ECCLESIASTICAL CENSORS UNDER PAIN OF EXCOMMUNICATION AND FINE
7095-88484-0029 IT IS EASILY UNDERSTOOD THAT HAVING DECLARED THE BIBLE TO CONTAIN ALL KNOWLEDGE BOTH SCIENTIFIC AND SPIRITUAL AND THEN PASSING A DECREE ORDERING NO BOOKS TO BE PRINTED
7095-88484-0030 WHICH DID NOT AGREE ON ALL POINTS WITH THE CHURCH'S INTERPRETATION OF THE BIBLE THE CHURCH WAS IN ABSOLUTE CONTROL OF ALL THOUGHT BOTH WRITTEN AND SPOKEN IT WAS TO NO ADVANTAGE FOR THE SCHOLAR TO INVESTIGATE ANY NEW FIELDS
7095-88484-0031 FOR ALL KNOWLEDGE WHICH WAS POSSIBLE FOR THE MIND TO DISCOVER HAD ALREADY BEEN REVEALED IN THE SCRIPTURES THUS DECLARED THE CHURCH WE UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAS THAT COPERNICUS DID NOT PERMIT HIS BOOK TO BE PUBLISHED UNTIL HE WAS DYING
7095-88484-0032 WE UNDERSTAND ALSO THAT WHEN GALILEO AND BRUNO HAD THE COURAGE OF THEIR CONVICTIONS AND GAVE VOICE TO THEIR BELIEFS THEY WERE PERSECUTED GALILEO WAS MADE TO RECANT A DISCOVERY
7095-88484-0033 WAS HOSTILE TO THE TRUTH AS WITNESS THE PERSECUTIONS OF THOSE WHO DARED TO VENTURE THAT THE EARTH WAS ROUND BOTANY MATHEMATICS AND GEOMETRY AS WELL AS THE NATURAL SCIENCES SLUMBERED GEOLOGY
7095-88484-0034 THE CLERGY OPPOSED FIRE AND MARINE INSURANCE ON THE GROUND THAT IT WAS A TEMPTING OF PROVIDENCE LIFE INSURANCE WAS REGARDED AS AN ACT OF INTERFERENCE WITH THE CONSEQUENCE OF GOD'S WILL MEDICINE MET THE MOST STRENUOUS OF OPPOSITION
