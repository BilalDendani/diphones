5115-26950-0000 WHILE BALDASSARRE WAS POSSESSED BY THE VOICE OF SAVONAROLA HE HAD NOT NOTICED THAT ANOTHER MAN HAD ENTERED THROUGH THE DOORWAY BEHIND HIM
5115-26950-0001 HAVING COME SOLELY TO LOOK AT THE ESCAPED PRISONER DURING THE PAUSE IN WHICH THE PREACHER AND HIS AUDIENCE HAD GIVEN THEMSELVES UP TO INARTICULATE EMOTION THE NEW COMER ADVANCED AND TOUCHED BALDASSARRE ON THE ARM HE LOOKED ROUND WITH THE TEARS STILL SLOWLY ROLLING DOWN HIS FACE
5115-26950-0002 THERE WAS SOMETHING SO PECULIAR IN THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE WELL HE THOUGHT IF HE DOES ANY MISCHIEF HE'LL SOON GET TIED UP AGAIN THE POOR DEVIL SHALL HAVE A CHANCE AT LEAST YOU ARE AFRAID OF ME HE SAID AGAIN IN AN UNDERTONE YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT YOURSELF
5115-26950-0003 BALDASSARRE WAS FOLDING HIS ARMS IN ENJOYMENT OF THE LONG ABSENT MUSCULAR SENSATION HE ANSWERED PIERO WITH A LESS SUSPICIOUS LOOK AND A TONE WHICH HAD SOME QUIET DECISION IN IT NO I HAVE NOTHING TO TELL AS YOU PLEASE SAID PIERO BUT PERHAPS YOU WANT SHELTER
5115-26950-0004 AND MAY NOT KNOW HOW HOSPITABLE WE FLORENTINES ARE TO VISITORS WITH TORN DOUBLETS AND EMPTY STOMACHS THERE'S AN HOSPITAL FOR POOR TRAVELLERS OUTSIDE ALL OUR GATES
5115-26950-0005 THERE'S NO DANGER FROM YOUR FRENCH SOLDIER HE HAS BEEN SENT OFF BALDASSARRE NODDED AND TURNED IN SILENT ACCEPTANCE OF THE OFFER AND HE AND PIERO LEFT THE CHURCH TOGETHER
5115-26950-0006 ON THE WAY TO THE GATE OF SANTA CROCE I AM A PAINTER I WOULD GIVE YOU MONEY TO GET YOUR PORTRAIT THE SUSPICION RETURNED INTO BALDASSARRE'S GLANCE AS HE LOOKED AT PIERO AND SAID DECIDEDLY NO AH SAID THE PAINTER CURTLY WELL GO STRAIGHT ON AND YOU'LL FIND THE PORTA SANTA CROCE
5115-26950-0007 IT IS WELL SAID PIERO WITH A SHRUG AND THEY TURNED AWAY FROM EACH OTHER A MYSTERIOUS OLD TIGER THOUGHT THE ARTIST WELL WORTH PAINTING UGLY WITH DEEP LINES
5115-26950-0008 A FINE CONTRAST TO MY BLAND AND SMILING MESSER GRECO MY BACCO TRIONFANTE WHO HAS MARRIED THE FAIR ANTIGONE IN CONTRADICTION TO ALL HISTORY AND FITNESS AHA HIS SCHOLAR'S BLOOD CURDLED UNCOMFORTABLY AT THE OLD FELLOW'S CLUTCH
5115-26950-0009 WHEN PIERO RE ENTERED THE PIAZZA DEL DUOMO THE MULTITUDE WHO HAD BEEN LISTENING TO FRA GIROLAMO WERE POURING OUT FROM ALL THE DOORS AND THE HASTE THEY MADE TO GO ON THEIR SEVERAL WAYS WAS A PROOF HOW IMPORTANT THEY HELD THE PREACHING WHICH HAD DETAINED THEM FROM THE OTHER OCCUPATIONS OF THE DAY
5115-26950-0010 THE ARTIST LEANED AGAINST AN ANGLE OF THE BAPTISTERY AND WATCHED THE DEPARTING CROWD DELIGHTING IN THE VARIETY OF THE GARB AND OF THE KEEN CHARACTERISTIC FACES FACES SUCH AS MASACCIO HAD PAINTED MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS BEFORE
5115-26950-0011 HAD REPRESENTED EVEN MORE COMPLETELY THAN USUAL THE VARIOUS CLASSES AND POLITICAL PARTIES OF FLORENCE THERE WERE MEN OF HIGH BIRTH ACCUSTOMED TO PUBLIC CHARGES AT HOME AND ABROAD WHO HAD BECOME NEWLY CONSPICUOUS NOT ONLY AS ENEMIES OF THE MEDICI AND FRIENDS OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT
5115-26950-0012 VERY MUCH GRATIFIED BY AN IMMEDIATE DIVINE AUTHORITY FOR BRINGING ABOUT FREEDOM IN THEIR OWN WAY OTHERS LIKE SODERINI WITH LESS OF THE ARDENT PIAGNONE AND MORE OF THE WISE POLITICIAN THERE WERE MEN ALSO OF FAMILY LIKE PIERO CAPPONI
5115-26950-0013 SIMPLY BRAVE UNDOCTRINAL LOVERS OF A SOBER REPUBLICAN LIBERTY WHO PREFERRED FIGHTING TO ARGUING AND HAD NO PARTICULAR REASONS FOR THINKING ANY IDEAS FALSE THAT KEPT OUT THE MEDICI AND MADE ROOM FOR PUBLIC SPIRIT
5115-26950-0014 AT THEIR ELBOWS WERE DOCTORS OF LAW WHOSE STUDIES OF ACCURSIUS AND HIS BRETHREN HAD NOT SO ENTIRELY CONSUMED THEIR ARDOUR AS TO PREVENT THEM FROM BECOMING ENTHUSIASTIC PIAGNONI MESSER LUCA CORSINI HIMSELF FOR EXAMPLE
5115-26950-0015 WHO ON A MEMORABLE OCCASION YET TO COME WAS TO RAISE HIS LEARNED ARMS IN STREET STONE THROWING FOR THE CAUSE OF RELIGION FREEDOM AND THE FRATE AND AMONG THE DIGNITIES WHO CARRIED THEIR BLACK LUCCO OR FURRED MANTLE WITH AN AIR OF HABITUAL AUTHORITY
5115-26950-0016 THERE WAS AN ABUNDANT SPRINKLING OF MEN WITH MORE CONTEMPLATIVE AND SENSITIVE FACES SCHOLARS INHERITING SUCH HIGH NAMES AS STROZZI AND ACCIAJOLI WHO WERE ALREADY MINDED TO TAKE THE COWL AND JOIN THE COMMUNITY OF SAN MARCO
5115-26950-0017 ARTISTS WROUGHT TO A NEW AND HIGHER AMBITION BY THE TEACHING OF SAVONAROLA LIKE THAT YOUNG PAINTER WHO HAD LATELY SURPASSED HIMSELF IN HIS FRESCO OF THE DIVINE CHILD ON THE WALL OF THE FRATE'S BARE CELL
5115-26950-0018 AND BE CALLED FRA BARTOLOMMEO THERE WAS THE MYSTIC POET GIROLAMO BENEVIENI HASTENING PERHAPS TO CARRY TIDINGS OF THE BELOVED FRATE'S SPEEDY COMING TO HIS FRIEND PICO DELLA MIRANDOLA WHO WAS NEVER TO SEE THE LIGHT OF ANOTHER MORNING
5115-26950-0019 CONSCIOUS OF PURSES THREATENED BY WAR TAXES AND MORE STRIKING AND VARIOUS PERHAPS THAN ALL THE OTHER CLASSES OF THE FRATE'S DISCIPLES THERE WAS THE LONG STREAM OF POORER TRADESMEN AND ARTISANS WHOSE FAITH AND HOPE IN HIS DIVINE MESSAGE VARIED FROM THE RUDE AND UNDISCRIMINATING TRUST IN HIM
5115-26950-0020 AS THE FRIEND OF THE POOR AND THE ENEMY OF THE LUXURIOUS OPPRESSIVE RICH TO THAT EAGER TASTING OF ALL THE SUBTLETIES OF BIBLICAL INTERPRETATION
5115-26950-0021 ILLUMINATING THE LONG DIM SPACES BEYOND THE BOARD WHERE HE STITCHES WITH A PALE FLAME THAT SEEMS TO HIM THE LIGHT OF DIVINE SCIENCE BUT AMONG THESE VARIOUS DISCIPLES OF THE FRATE WERE SCATTERED MANY WHO WERE NOT IN THE LEAST HIS DISCIPLES
5115-26950-0022 BEGUN TO SHOW THE PRESIDING SPIRIT OF THE POPULAR PARTY A FEIGNED DEFERENCE OTHERS WERE SINCERE ADVOCATES OF A FREE GOVERNMENT BUT REGARDED SAVONAROLA SIMPLY AS AN AMBITIOUS MONK HALF SAGACIOUS HALF FANATICAL
5115-26950-0023 WHO HAD MADE HIMSELF A POWERFUL INSTRUMENT WITH THE PEOPLE AND MUST BE ACCEPTED AS AN IMPORTANT SOCIAL FACT
5115-26950-0024 ATTRACTING THE EARS OF CURIOSITY AND MALICE AS WELL AS OF FAITH THE MEN OF IDEAS LIKE YOUNG NICCOLO MACCHIAVELLI WENT TO OBSERVE AND WRITE REPORTS TO FRIENDS AWAY IN COUNTRY VILLAS THE MEN OF APPETITES LIKE DOLFO SPINI
5115-26950-0025 BENT ON HUNTING DOWN THE FRATE AS A PUBLIC NUISANCE WHO MADE GAME SCARCE WENT TO FEED THEIR HATRED AND LIE IN WAIT FOR GROUNDS OF ACCUSATION PERHAPS WHILE NO PREACHER EVER HAD A MORE MASSIVE INFLUENCE THAN SAVONAROLA
5115-26950-0026 NO PREACHER EVER HAD MORE HETEROGENEOUS MATERIALS TO WORK UPON AND ONE SECRET OF THE MASSIVE INFLUENCE LAY IN THE HIGHLY MIXED CHARACTER OF HIS PREACHING BALDASSARRE WROUGHT INTO AN ECSTASY OF SELF MARTYRING REVENGE
5115-26950-0027 WAS ONLY AN EXTREME CASE AMONG THE PARTIAL AND NARROW SYMPATHIES OF THAT AUDIENCE IN SAVONAROLA'S PREACHING THERE WERE STRAINS THAT APPEALED TO THE VERY FINEST SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF MEN'S NATURES AND THERE WERE ELEMENTS THAT GRATIFIED LOW EGOISM
5115-26950-0028 TICKLED GOSSIPING CURIOSITY AND FASCINATED TIMOROUS SUPERSTITION HIS NEED OF PERSONAL PREDOMINANCE HIS LABYRINTHINE ALLEGORICAL INTERPRETATIONS OF THE SCRIPTURES HIS ENIGMATIC VISIONS AND HIS FALSE CERTITUDE ABOUT THE DIVINE INTENTIONS
5115-26950-0029 NEVER CEASED IN HIS OWN LARGE SOUL TO BE ENNOBLED BY THAT FERVID PIETY THAT PASSIONATE SENSE OF THE INFINITE THAT ACTIVE SYMPATHY THAT CLEAR SIGHTED DEMAND FOR THE SUBJECTION OF SELFISH INTERESTS TO THE GENERAL GOOD WHICH HE HAD IN COMMON WITH THE GREATEST OF MANKIND
5115-26950-0030 BUT FOR THE MASS OF HIS AUDIENCE ALL THE PREGNANCY OF HIS PREACHING LAY IN HIS STRONG ASSERTION OF SUPERNATURAL CLAIMS IN HIS DENUNCIATORY VISIONS IN THE FALSE CERTITUDE WHICH GAVE HIS SERMONS THE INTEREST OF A POLITICAL BULLETIN AND HAVING ONCE HELD THAT AUDIENCE IN HIS MASTERY IT WAS NECESSARY TO HIS NATURE
5115-26950-0031 IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THEIR WELFARE THAT HE SHOULD KEEP THE MASTERY THE EFFECT WAS INEVITABLE NO MAN EVER STRUGGLED TO RETAIN POWER OVER A MIXED MULTITUDE WITHOUT SUFFERING VITIATION HIS STANDARD MUST BE THEIR LOWER NEEDS AND NOT HIS OWN BEST INSIGHT
5115-26950-0032 THAN IN GIROLAMO SAVONAROLA BUT WE CAN GIVE HIM A REVERENCE THAT NEEDS NO SHUTTING OF THE EYES TO FACT IF WE REGARD HIS LIFE AS A DRAMA IN WHICH THERE WERE GREAT INWARD MODIFICATIONS ACCOMPANYING THE OUTWARD CHANGES
5115-26950-0033 IT IS PROBABLE THAT HIS IMPERIOUS NEED OF ASCENDANCY HAD BURNED UNDISCERNIBLY IN THE STRONG FLAME OF HIS ZEAL FOR GOD AND MAN
