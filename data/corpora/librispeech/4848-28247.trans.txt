4848-28247-0000 THE RESIDUUM OF A CONTINENT ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY THE VOYAGERS IN THE DOBRYNA FELL INTO THE HABIT OF USING GALLIA AS THE NAME OF THE NEW WORLD IN WHICH THEY BECAME AWARE THEY MUST BE MAKING
4848-28247-0001 AN EXTRAORDINARY EXCURSION THROUGH THE REALMS OF SPACE NOTHING HOWEVER WAS ALLOWED TO DIVERT THEM FROM THEIR OSTENSIBLE OBJECT OF MAKING A SURVEY OF THE COAST OF THE MEDITERRANEAN
4848-28247-0002 AND ACCORDINGLY THEY PERSEVERED IN FOLLOWING THAT SINGULAR BOUNDARY WHICH HAD REVEALED ITSELF TO THEIR EXTREME ASTONISHMENT
4848-28247-0003 HAVING ROUNDED THE GREAT PROMONTORY THAT HAD BARRED HER FARTHER PROGRESS TO THE NORTH THE SCHOONER SKIRTED ITS UPPER EDGE A FEW MORE LEAGUES AND THEY OUGHT TO BE ABREAST OF THE SHORES OF FRANCE
4848-28247-0004 YES OF FRANCE BUT WHO SHALL DESCRIBE THE FEELINGS OF HECTOR SERVADAC WHEN INSTEAD OF THE CHARMING OUTLINE OF HIS NATIVE LAND HE BEHELD NOTHING BUT A SOLID BOUNDARY OF SAVAGE ROCK
4848-28247-0005 WHO SHALL REVEAL THE BURNING ANXIETY WITH WHICH HE THROBBED TO SEE BEYOND THAT CRUEL WALL BUT THERE SEEMED NO HOPE ONWARDS AND ONWARDS THE YACHT MADE HER WAY AND STILL NO SIGN OF FRANCE
4848-28247-0006 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED THAT SERVADAC'S PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES WOULD HAVE PREPARED HIM FOR THE DISCOVERY THAT THE CATASTROPHE WHICH HAD OVERWHELMED OTHER SITES HAD BROUGHT DESTRUCTION TO HIS OWN COUNTRY AS WELL
4848-28247-0007 BUT HE HAD FAILED TO REALIZE HOW IT MIGHT EXTEND TO FRANCE AND WHEN NOW HE WAS OBLIGED WITH HIS OWN EYES TO WITNESS THE WAVES OF OCEAN ROLLING OVER WHAT ONCE HAD BEEN THE LOVELY SHORES OF PROVENCE
4848-28247-0008 HE WAS WELL NIGH FRANTIC WITH DESPERATION AM I TO BELIEVE THAT GOURBI ISLAND THAT LITTLE SHRED OF ALGERIA CONSTITUTES ALL THAT IS LEFT OF OUR GLORIOUS FRANCE
4848-28247-0009 NOT YET HAVE WE REACHED THE POLE OF OUR NEW WORLD THERE IS THERE MUST BE SOMETHING MORE BEHIND THAT FROWNING ROCK OH THAT FOR A MOMENT WE COULD SCALE ITS TOWERING HEIGHT AND LOOK BEYOND
4848-28247-0010 BY HEAVEN I ADJURE YOU LET US DISEMBARK AND MOUNT THE SUMMIT AND EXPLORE FRANCE LIES BEYOND DISEMBARKATION HOWEVER WAS AN UTTER IMPOSSIBILITY
4848-28247-0011 THAT HAD ALL ALONG BEEN SO PRONOUNCED A FEATURE WITH HER STEAM AT HIGH PRESSURE THE YACHT MADE RAPID PROGRESS TOWARDS THE EAST THE WEATHER REMAINED PERFECTLY FINE
4848-28247-0012 THE TEMPERATURE BECAME GRADUALLY COOLER SO THAT THERE WAS LITTLE PROSPECT OF VAPORS ACCUMULATING IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND NOTHING MORE THAN A FEW CIRRI ALMOST TRANSPARENT VEILED HERE AND THERE THE CLEAR AZURE OF THE SKY
4848-28247-0013 THROUGHOUT THE DAY THE PALE RAYS OF THE SUN APPARENTLY LESSENED IN ITS MAGNITUDE CAST ONLY FAINT AND SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN SHADOWS BUT AT NIGHT THE STARS SHONE WITH SURPASSING BRILLIANCY
4848-28247-0014 BUT JUPITER ON THE OTHER HAND HAD ASSUMED SPLENDID PROPORTIONS SATURN WAS SUPERB IN ITS LUSTER AND URANUS WHICH HITHERTO HAD BEEN IMPERCEPTIBLE WITHOUT A TELESCOPE
4848-28247-0015 WAS POINTED OUT BY LIEUTENANT PROCOPE PLAINLY VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE THE INFERENCE WAS IRRESISTIBLE THAT GALLIA WAS RECEDING FROM THE SUN AND TRAVELING FAR AWAY ACROSS THE PLANETARY REGIONS
4848-28247-0016 THE PENINSULA OF SAINT TROPEZ THE LERIUS ISLANDS AND THE GULFS OF CANNES AND JOUAR THE DOBRYNA ARRIVED UPON THE SITE OF THE CAPE OF ANTIBES
4848-28247-0017 HERE QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY THE EXPLORERS MADE THE DISCOVERY THAT THE MASSIVE WALL OF CLIFF HAD BEEN RENT FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM BY A NARROW RIFT LIKE THE DRY BED OF A MOUNTAIN TORRENT
4848-28247-0018 AND AT THE BASE OF THE OPENING LEVEL WITH THE SEA WAS A LITTLE STRAND UPON WHICH THERE WAS JUST SPACE ENOUGH FOR THEIR BOAT TO BE HAULED UP JOY JOY SHOUTED SERVADAC HALF BESIDE HIMSELF WITH ECSTASY
4848-28247-0019 WE CAN LAND AT LAST COUNT TIMASCHEFF AND THE LIEUTENANT WERE SCARCELY LESS IMPATIENT THAN THE CAPTAIN AND LITTLE NEEDED HIS URGENT AND REPEATED SOLICITATIONS COME ON QUICK COME ON NO TIME TO LOSE
4848-28247-0020 IT WAS HALF PAST SEVEN IN THE MORNING WHEN THEY SET THEIR FOOT UPON THIS UNTRIED LAND THE BIT OF STRAND WAS ONLY A FEW SQUARE YARDS IN AREA QUITE A NARROW STRIP
4848-28247-0021 AND EXAMINE THESE REMNANTS OF THE ANCIENT SHORE THEY HURRIED ON TO SCALE THE HEIGHTS THE NARROW RAVINE WAS NOT ONLY PERFECTLY DRY BUT MANIFESTLY HAD NEVER BEEN THE BED OF ANY MOUNTAIN TORRENT
4848-28247-0022 THE ROCKS THAT RESTED AT THE BOTTOM JUST AS THOSE WHICH FORMED ITS SIDES WERE OF THE SAME LAMELLOUS FORMATION AS THE ENTIRE COAST AND HAD NOT HITHERTO BEEN SUBJECT TO THE DISAGGREGATION
4848-28247-0023 WHICH THE LAPSE OF TIME NEVER FAILS TO WORK A SKILLED GEOLOGIST WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ASSIGN THEM THEIR PROPER SCIENTIFIC CLASSIFICATION
4848-28247-0024 BUT NEITHER SERVADAC TIMASCHEFF NOR THE LIEUTENANT COULD PRETEND TO ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THEIR SPECIFIC CHARACTER ALTHOUGH HOWEVER THE BOTTOM OF THE CHASM HAD NEVER AS YET BEEN THE CHANNEL OF A STREAM
4848-28247-0025 INDICATIONS WERE NOT WANTING THAT AT SOME FUTURE TIME IT WOULD BE THE NATURAL OUTLET OF ACCUMULATED WATERS FOR ALREADY IN MANY PLACES THIN LAYERS OF SNOW WERE GLITTERING UPON THE SURFACE OF THE FRACTURED ROCKS
4848-28247-0026 AND THE HIGHER THE ELEVATION THAT WAS GAINED THE MORE THESE LAYERS WERE FOUND TO INCREASE IN AREA AND IN DEPTH HERE IS A TRACE OF FRESH WATER THE FIRST THAT GALLIA HAS EXHIBITED SAID THE COUNT TO HIS COMPANIONS
4848-28247-0027 AND IF IT IS SO WE MUST NOW BE VERY CLOSE TO HER ARCTIC REGIONS IT IS TRUE THAT HER AXIS IS NOT SO MUCH INCLINED AS TO PROLONG DAY AND NIGHT AS AT THE POLES OF THE EARTH
4848-28247-0028 AND THE COLD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD WILL BE INTENSE SO COLD DO YOU THINK ASKED SERVADAC THAT ANIMAL LIFE MUST BE EXTINCT I DO NOT SAY THAT CAPTAIN ANSWERED THE LIEUTENANT
4848-28247-0029 I DO NOT SEE WHY ITS TEMPERATURE SHOULD FALL BELOW WHAT PREVAILS IN THOSE OUTLYING REGIONS BEYOND OUR SYSTEM WHERE SKY AND AIR ARE NOT AND WHAT TEMPERATURE MAY THAT BE INQUIRED THE CAPTAIN WITH A SHUDDER
4848-28247-0030 SIXTY SIXTY DEGREES BELOW ZERO CRIED THE COUNT WHY THERE'S NOT A RUSSIAN COULD ENDURE IT I BEG YOUR PARDON COUNT IT IS PLACED ON RECORD THAT THE ENGLISH HAVE SURVIVED IT
4848-28247-0031 OR SOMETHING QUITE APPROXIMATE UPON THEIR ARCTIC EXPEDITIONS WHEN CAPTAIN PARRY WAS ON MELVILLE ISLAND HE KNEW THE THERMOMETER TO FALL TO FIFTY SIX DEGREES SAID PROCOPE
4848-28247-0032 AS THE EXPLORERS ADVANCED THEY SEEMED GLAD TO PAUSE FROM TIME TO TIME THAT THEY MIGHT RECOVER THEIR BREATH FOR THE AIR BECOMING MORE AND MORE RAREFIED
4848-28247-0033 MADE RESPIRATION SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT AND THE ASCENT FATIGUING BEFORE THEY HAD REACHED AN ALTITUDE OF SIX HUNDRED FEET THEY NOTICED A SENSIBLE DIMINUTION OF THE TEMPERATURE
4848-28247-0034 AND REACHING INTERMINABLY TO THE FAR OFF HORIZON HIS HEART SANK WITHIN HIM THE WHOLE REGION APPEARED TO CONSIST OF NOTHING BUT THE SAME STRANGE UNIFORM MINERAL CONGLOMERATE
4848-28247-0035 CRYSTALLIZED INTO REGULAR HEXAGONAL PRISMS BUT WHATEVER WAS ITS GEOLOGICAL CHARACTER IT WAS ONLY TOO EVIDENT THAT IT HAD ENTIRELY REPLACED THE FORMER SOIL
4848-28247-0036 SO THAT NOT A VESTIGE OF THE OLD CONTINENT OF EUROPE COULD BE DISCERNED THE LOVELY SCENERY OF PROVENCE WITH THE GRACE OF ITS RICH AND UNDULATING LANDSCAPE ITS GARDENS OF CITRONS AND ORANGES
4848-28247-0037 RISING TIER UPON TIER FROM THE DEEP RED SOIL ALL ALL HAD VANISHED OF THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE REPRESENTATIVE
4848-28247-0038 THE MINERAL KINGDOM REIGNED SUPREME CAPTAIN SERVADAC'S DEEP DEJECTION WAS IN STRANGE CONTRAST TO HIS GENERAL HILARITY SILENT AND TEARFUL HE STOOD UPON AN ICE BOUND ROCK
4848-28247-0039 STRAINING HIS EYES ACROSS THE BOUNDLESS VISTA OF THE MYSTERIOUS TERRITORY IT CANNOT BE HE EXCLAIMED WE MUST SOMEHOW HAVE MISTAKEN OUR BEARINGS TRUE WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED THIS BARRIER
4848-28247-0040 BUT FRANCE IS THERE BEYOND YES FRANCE IS THERE COME COUNT COME BY ALL THAT'S PITIFUL I ENTREAT YOU COME AND EXPLORE THE FARTHEST VERGE OF THE ICE BOUND TRACK
4848-28247-0041 HE PUSHED ONWARDS ALONG THE RUGGED SURFACE OF THE ROCK BUT HAD NOT PROCEEDED FAR BEFORE HE CAME TO A SUDDEN PAUSE HIS FOOT HAD COME IN CONTACT WITH SOMETHING HARD BENEATH THE SNOW
4848-28247-0042 AND STOOPING DOWN HE PICKED UP A LITTLE BLOCK OF STONY SUBSTANCE WHICH THE FIRST GLANCE REVEALED TO BE OF A GEOLOGICAL CHARACTER ALTOGETHER ALIEN TO THE UNIVERSAL ROCKS AROUND
4848-28247-0043 VIL VILLA HE CRIED OUT IN HIS EXCITEMENT DROPPING THE MARBLE WHICH WAS BROKEN INTO ATOMS BY THE FALL WHAT ELSE COULD THIS FRAGMENT BE BUT THE SOLE SURVIVING REMNANT OF SOME SUMPTUOUS MANSION
4848-28247-0044 AND COMMANDING THE GORGEOUS PANORAMA THAT EMBRACED THE MARITIME ALPS AND REACHED BEYOND MONACO AND MENTONE TO THE ITALIAN HEIGHT OF BORDIGHERA
