1046-133224-0000 THIS IDEA WAS FIRST FORMULATED BY MISTER HENRY GEORGE IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE AND HAS GROWN STEADILY IN FAVOR SINGLE TAX MEN ASSERT AS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE THAT ALL MEN ARE EQUALLY ENTITLED TO THE USE OF THE EARTH
1046-133224-0001 THEREFORE NO ONE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HOLD VALUABLE LAND WITHOUT PAYING TO THE COMMUNITY THE VALUE OF THE PRIVILEGE THEY HOLD THAT THIS IS THE ONLY RIGHTFUL SOURCE OF PUBLIC REVENUE AND THEY WOULD THEREFORE ABOLISH ALL TAXATION
1046-133224-0002 LOCAL STATE AND NATIONAL EXCEPT A TAX UPON THE RENTAL VALUE OF LAND EXCLUSIVE OF ITS IMPROVEMENTS THE REVENUE THUS RAISED TO BE DIVIDED AMONG LOCAL STATE AND GENERAL GOVERNMENTS
1046-133224-0003 THE SINGLE TAX WOULD NOT FALL ON ALL LAND BUT ONLY ON VALUABLE LAND AND ON THAT IN PROPORTION TO ITS VALUE IT WOULD THUS BE A TAX NOT ON USE OR IMPROVEMENTS BUT ON OWNERSHIP OF LAND TAKING WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO TO THE LANDLORD AS OWNER
1046-133224-0004 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLE THAT ALL MEN ARE EQUALLY ENTITLED TO THE USE OF THE EARTH THEY WOULD SOLVE THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM BY PUBLIC OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF ALL HIGHWAYS INCLUDING THE ROADBEDS OF RAILROADS LEAVING THEIR USE EQUALLY FREE TO ALL
1046-133224-0005 THE SINGLE TAX SYSTEM WOULD THEY CLAIM DISPENSE WITH A HORDE OF TAX GATHERERS SIMPLIFY GOVERNMENT AND GREATLY REDUCE ITS COST GIVE US WITH ALL THE WORLD THAT ABSOLUTE FREE TRADE WHICH NOW EXISTS BETWEEN THE STATES OF THE UNION
1046-133224-0006 ABOLISH ALL TAXES ON PRIVATE ISSUES OF MONEY TAKE THE WEIGHT OF TAXATION FROM AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS WHERE LAND HAS LITTLE OR NO VALUE APART FROM IMPROVEMENTS AND PUT IT UPON VALUABLE LAND SUCH AS CITY LOTS AND MINERAL DEPOSITS
1046-133224-0007 IT WOULD CALL UPON MEN TO CONTRIBUTE FOR PUBLIC EXPENSES IN PROPORTION TO THE NATURAL OPPORTUNITIES THEY MONOPOLIZE AND MAKE IT UNPROFITABLE FOR SPECULATORS TO HOLD LAND UNUSED OR ONLY PARTLY USED
1046-133224-0008 THUS OPENING TO LABOR UNLIMITED FIELDS OF EMPLOYMENT SOLVING THE LABOR PROBLEM AND ABOLISHING INVOLUNTARY POVERTY THE MYSTERIES OF HYPNOTISM
1046-133224-0009 A COMPEND OF THE GENERAL CLAIMS MADE BY PROFESSIONAL HYPNOTISTS ANIMAL MAGNETISM IS THE NERVE FORCE OF ALL HUMAN AND ANIMAL BODIES AND IS COMMON TO EVERY PERSON IN A GREATER OR LESS DEGREE
1046-133224-0010 IT MAY BE TRANSMITTED FROM ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER THE TRANSMITTING FORCE IS THE CONCENTRATED EFFORT OF WILL POWER WHICH SENDS THE MAGNETIC CURRENT THROUGH THE NERVES OF THE OPERATOR TO THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY OF HIS SUBJECT
1046-133224-0011 IT MAY BE TRANSMITTED BY AND THROUGH THE EYES AS WELL AS THE FINGER TIPS
1046-133224-0012 AS WELL AS TO THE MIND THE EFFECT OF THIS FORCE UPON THE SUBJECT WILL DEPEND VERY MUCH UPON THE HEALTH MENTAL CAPACITY AND GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE OPERATOR
1046-133224-0013 ITS ACTION IN GENERAL SHOULD BE SOOTHING AND QUIETING UPON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM STIMULATING TO THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD THE BRAIN AND OTHER VITAL ORGANS OF THE BODY OF THE SUBJECT IT IS THE USE AND APPLICATION OF THIS POWER OR FORCE
1046-133224-0014 THAT CONSTITUTES HYPNOTISM MAGNETISM IS A QUALITY THAT INHERES IN EVERY HUMAN BEING AND IT MAY BE CULTIVATED LIKE ANY OTHER PHYSICAL OR MENTAL FORCE OF WHICH MEN AND WOMEN ARE CONSTITUTED
1046-133224-0015 FROM THE INTELLIGENT OPERATOR USING IT TO OVERCOME DISEASE A PATIENT EXPERIENCES A SOOTHING INFLUENCE THAT CAUSES A RELAXATION OF THE MUSCLES FOLLOWED BY A PLEASANT DROWSY FEELING WHICH SOON TERMINATES IN REFRESHING SLEEP
1046-133224-0016 ON WAKING THE PATIENT FEELS RESTED ALL HIS TROUBLES HAVE VANISHED FROM CONSCIOUSNESS
1046-133224-0017 IN THE TRUE HYPNOTIC CONDITION WHEN A PATIENT VOLUNTARILY SUBMITS TO THE OPERATOR ANY ATTEMPT TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS AGAINST THE INTERESTS OF THE PATIENT CAN INVARIABLY BE FRUSTRATED BY THE PATIENT
1046-133224-0018 SELF PRESERVATION IS THE FIRST LAW OF NATURE AND SOME OF THE BEST KNOWN OPERATORS WHO HAVE RECORDED THEIR EXPERIMENTS ASSERT THAT SUGGESTIONS NOT IN ACCORD WITH THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT COULD NOT BE CARRIED OUT
1046-133224-0019 NO ONE WAS EVER INDUCED TO COMMIT ANY CRIME UNDER HYPNOSIS THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO DO THE SAME THING MUCH EASIER WITHOUT HYPNOSIS THE HYPNOTIC STATE IS A CONDITION OF MIND
1046-133224-0020 THAT EXTENDS FROM A COMPARATIVELY WAKEFUL STATE WITH SLIGHT DROWSINESS TO COMPLETE SOMNAMBULISM NO TWO SUBJECTS AS A RULE EVER PRESENTING THE SAME CHARACTERISTICS THE OPERATOR TO BE SUCCESSFUL
1046-133224-0021 MUST HAVE CONTROL OF HIS OWN MIND BE IN PERFECT HEALTH AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO KEEP HIS MIND CONCENTRATED UPON THE OBJECT HE DESIRES TO ACCOMPLISH WITH HIS SUBJECT HOW TO CARE FOR A PIANO BY WILLIAM H DAMON
1046-133224-0022 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE PRESERVATION OF A PIANO IS TO AVOID ATMOSPHERIC CHANGES AND EXTREMES AND SUDDEN CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE WHERE THE SUMMER CONDITION OF THE ATMOSPHERE IS DAMP ALL PRECAUTIONS POSSIBLE
1046-133224-0023 SHOULD BE TAKEN TO AVOID AN ENTIRELY DRY CONDITION IN WINTER SUCH AS THAT GIVEN BY STEAM OR FURNACE HEAT IN ALL CASES SHOULD THE AIR IN THE HOME CONTAIN MOISTURE ENOUGH TO PERMIT A HEAVY FROST ON THE WINDOWS IN ZERO WEATHER
1046-133224-0024 THE ABSENCE OF FROST UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS IS POSITIVE PROOF OF AN ENTIRELY DRY ATMOSPHERE AND THIS IS A PIANO'S MOST DANGEROUS ENEMY CAUSING THE SOUNDING BOARD TO CRACK
1046-133224-0025 SHRINKING UP THE BRIDGES AND CONSEQUENTLY PUTTING THE PIANO SERIOUSLY OUT OF TUNE ALSO CAUSING AN UNDUE DRYNESS IN ALL THE ACTION PARTS AND OFTEN A LOOSENING OF THE GLUE JOINTS THUS PRODUCING CLICKS AND RATTLES
1046-133224-0026 TO OBVIATE THIS DIFFICULTY IS BY NO MEANS AN EASY TASK AND WILL REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION PERMIT ALL THE FRESH AIR POSSIBLE DURING WINTER BEING CAREFUL TO KEEP THE PIANO OUT OF COLD DRAFTS AS THIS WILL CAUSE A
1046-133224-0027 SUDDEN CONTRACTION OF THE VARNISH
1046-133224-0028 PLANTS IN THE ROOM ARE DESIRABLE AND VESSELS OF WATER OF ANY KIND WILL BE OF ASSISTANCE THE MOST POTENT MEANS OF AVOIDING EXTREME DRYNESS IS TO PLACE A SINGLE LOAF BREAD PAN HALF FULL OF WATER
1046-133224-0029 IN THE LOWER PART OF THE PIANO TAKING OUT THE LOWER PANEL AND PLACING IT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE PEDALS INSIDE
1046-133224-0030 CARE BEING TAKEN TO REMOVE THE VESSEL AS SOON AS THE HEAT IS DISCONTINUED IN THE SPRING IN CASES WHERE STOVE HEAT IS USED THESE PRECAUTIONS ARE NOT NECESSARY THE ACTION OF A PIANO
1046-133224-0031 LIKE ANY OTHER DELICATE PIECE OF MACHINERY SHOULD BE CAREFULLY EXAMINED
1046-133224-0032 THE HAMMERS NEED OCCASIONAL AND CAREFUL ATTENTION TO PRESERVE ORIGINAL TONE QUALITY AND ELASTICITY NEVER ALLOW THE PIANO TO BE BEATEN OR PLAYED HARD UPON THIS IS RUINOUS TO BOTH THE ACTION AND TUNING
1046-133224-0033 WHEN NOT IN USE THE MUSIC RACK AND TOP SHOULD BE CLOSED TO EXCLUDE DUST THE KEYBOARD NEED NEVER BE CLOSED AS THE IVORY NEEDS BOTH LIGHT AND VENTILATION
1046-133224-0034 AND WILL EVENTUALLY TURN YELLOW UNLESS LEFT OPEN THE CASE DEMANDS CAREFUL TREATMENT TO PRESERVE ITS BEAUTY AND POLISH NEVER USE ANYTHING OTHER THAN A SOFT PIECE OF COTTON CLOTH OR CHEESE CLOTH TO DUST IT WITH
1046-133224-0035 SILK IS NOT AS SOFT AS COTTON AND WILL SCRATCH
1046-133224-0036 AND GRIT AND GRADUALLY SCOURS OFF THE FINE FINISH IN DUSTING NEVER USE A FEATHER DUSTER NOR RUB THE PIANO HARD WITH ANYTHING THE DUST SHOULD BE WHIPPED OFF AND NOT RUBBED INTO THE VARNISH
1046-133224-0037 IF THE PIANO IS DINGY SMOKY OR DIRTY LOOKING IT SHOULD BE WASHED CAREFULLY WITH LUKEWARM WATER WITH A LITTLE AMMONIA IN IT TO SOFTEN IT NEVER USE SOAP
1046-133224-0038 WIPE OVER A SMALL PART AT A TIME WITH THE SPONGE FOLLOWING QUICKLY
1046-133224-0039 WRUNG OUT OF THE SAME WATER THIS WILL DRY IT IMMEDIATELY AND LEAVE IT AS BEAUTIFUL AND CLEAN AS NEW NEVER USE PATENT POLISHES IF YOUR PIANO NEEDS POLISHING EMPLOY A COMPETENT POLISHER
1046-133224-0040 TO GIVE IT A HAND RUBBING FRICTION POLISH THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN ON THE GLOBE IS NOT AS IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED MT EVEREST
1046-133224-0041 ON THE ISLE OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA DISCOVERED BY CAPTAIN LAWSON IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE ACCORDING TO LAWSON
1046-133224-0042 WHICH IS ONLY TWENTY NINE THOUSAND AND TWO FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE INDIAN OCEAN TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE THE HIGHEST POINT IN NEW GUINEA IS PUNCAK JAYA
1046-133224-0043 SALT RISING BREAD THE REAL FORMULA FOR MAKING SALT RISING BREAD AS SET DOWN BY THE DAUGHTER OF GOVERNOR STUBBS OF KANSAS
1046-133224-0044 AND BY HIM COMMUNICATED TO THEODORE ROOSEVELT IS AS FOLLOWS ACCORDING TO THE SATURDAY EVENING POST ON THE NIGHT BEFORE YOU CONTEMPLATE THIS MASTERPIECE OF BAKING
1046-133224-0045 SCALD THIS WITH NEW MILK HEATED TO THE BOILING POINT AND MIX TO THE THICKNESS OF MUSH THIS CAN BE MADE IN A CUP WRAP IN A CLEAN CLOTH AND PUT IN A WARM PLACE OVERNIGHT
1046-133224-0046 IN THE MORNING WHEN ALL IS READY TAKE A ONE GALLON STONE JAR AND INTO THIS PUT ONE SCANT CUPFUL OF NEW MILK ADD A LEVEL TEASPOONFUL OF SALT AND ONE OF SUGAR
1046-133224-0047 SCALD THIS WITH THREE CUPFULS OF WATER HEATED TO THE BOILING POINT REDUCE TO A TEMPERATURE OF ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHT DEGREES WITH COLD WATER USING A MILK THERMOMETER TO ENABLE YOU TO GET EXACTLY THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE
1046-133224-0048 THEN ADD FLOUR AND MIX TO A GOOD BATTER
1046-133224-0049 AND KEEP THIS WATER AT A TEMPERATURE OF ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHT DEGREES UNTIL THE SPONGE RISES IT SHOULD RISE AT LEAST AN INCH AND A HALF WHEN IT HAS RAISED MIX TO A STIFF DOUGH MAKE INTO LOAVES AND PUT INTO PANS
1046-133224-0050 DO NOT LET THE HEAT GET OUT OF THE DOUGH WHILE WORKING GREASE THE LOAVES WELL ON TOP AND SET YOUR BREAD WHERE IT WILL BE WARM AND RISE AFTER THE LOAVES RISE BAKE IN A MEDIUM OVEN FOR ONE HOUR AND TEN MINUTES
1046-133224-0051 WHEN YOU TAKE THE LOAVES FROM THE OVEN WRAP THEM IN A BREAD CLOTH A CURE FOR LOVE TAKE TWELVE OUNCES OF DISLIKE ONE POUND OF RESOLUTION TWO GRAINS OF COMMON SENSE TWO OUNCES OF EXPERIENCE
1046-133224-0052 A LARGE SPRIG OF TIME AND THREE QUARTS OF COOLING WATER OF CONSIDERATION SET THEM OVER A GENTLE FIRE OF LOVE SWEETEN IT WITH SUGAR OF FORGETFULNESS SKIM IT WITH THE SPOON OF MELANCHOLY
1046-133224-0053 PUT IT IN THE BOTTOM OF YOUR HEART CORK IT WITH THE CORK OF CLEAN CONSCIENCE LET IT REMAIN AND YOU WILL QUICKLY FIND EASE AND BE RESTORED TO YOUR SENSES AGAIN
