408-122806-0000 THE SHADOW IT IS IN THE HOT LANDS THAT THE SUN BURNS SURE ENOUGH THERE THE PEOPLE BECOME QUITE A MAHOGANY BROWN AY AND IN THE HOTTEST LANDS THEY ARE BURNT TO NEGROES
408-122806-0001 BUT NOW IT WAS ONLY TO THE HOT LANDS THAT A LEARNED MAN HAD COME FROM THE COLD THERE HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD RUN ABOUT JUST AS WHEN AT HOME BUT HE SOON FOUND OUT HIS MISTAKE HE
408-122806-0002 AND ALL SENSIBLE FOLKS WERE OBLIGED TO STAY WITHIN DOORS THE WINDOW SHUTTERS AND DOORS WERE CLOSED THE WHOLE DAY IT LOOKED AS IF THE WHOLE HOUSE SLEPT OR THERE WAS NO ONE AT HOME
408-122806-0003 THE NARROW STREET WITH THE HIGH HOUSES WAS BUILT SO THAT THE SUNSHINE MUST FALL THERE FROM MORNING TILL EVENING IT WAS REALLY NOT TO BE BORNE THE LEARNED MAN FROM THE COLD LANDS HE WAS A YOUNG MAN
408-122806-0004 IT WAS FIRST TOWARDS EVENING WHEN THE SUN WAS DOWN THAT THEY BEGAN TO FRESHEN UP AGAIN IN THE WARM LANDS EVERY WINDOW HAS A BALCONY AND THE PEOPLE CAME OUT ON ALL THE BALCONIES IN THE STREET
408-122806-0005 FOR ONE MUST HAVE AIR EVEN IF ONE BE ACCUSTOMED TO BE MAHOGANY IT WAS LIVELY BOTH UP AND DOWN THE STREET TAILORS AND SHOEMAKERS AND ALL THE FOLKS MOVED OUT INTO THE STREET CHAIRS AND TABLES WERE BROUGHT FORTH
408-122806-0006 AND CANDLES BURNT YES ABOVE A THOUSAND LIGHTS WERE BURNING AND THE ONE TALKED AND THE OTHER SUNG AND PEOPLE WALKED AND CHURCH BELLS RANG AND ASSES WENT ALONG WITH A DINGLE DINGLE DONG FOR THEY TOO HAD BELLS ON
408-122806-0007 THE STREET BOYS WERE SCREAMING AND HOOTING AND SHOUTING AND SHOOTING WITH DEVILS AND DETONATING BALLS AND THERE CAME CORPSE BEARERS AND HOOD WEARERS FOR THERE WERE FUNERALS WITH PSALM AND HYMN AND THEN
408-122806-0008 THE DIN OF CARRIAGES DRIVING AND COMPANY ARRIVING YES IT WAS IN TRUTH LIVELY ENOUGH DOWN IN THE STREET
408-122806-0009 ONLY IN THAT SINGLE HOUSE WHICH STOOD OPPOSITE THAT IN WHICH THE LEARNED FOREIGNER LIVED IT WAS QUITE STILL AND YET SOME ONE LIVED THERE FOR THERE STOOD FLOWERS IN THE BALCONY
408-122806-0010 THEY GREW SO WELL IN THE SUN'S HEAT AND THAT THEY COULD NOT DO UNLESS THEY WERE WATERED AND SOME ONE MUST WATER THEM THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY THERE THE DOOR OPPOSITE WAS ALSO OPENED LATE IN THE EVENING
408-122806-0011 FOR HE FOUND EVERYTHING MARVELLOUS OUT THERE IN THE WARM LANDS IF THERE HAD ONLY BEEN NO SUN THE STRANGER'S LANDLORD SAID THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO HAD TAKEN THE HOUSE OPPOSITE ONE SAW NO PERSON ABOUT
408-122806-0012 AND AS TO THE MUSIC IT APPEARED TO HIM TO BE EXTREMELY TIRESOME IT IS AS IF SOME ONE SAT THERE AND PRACTISED A PIECE THAT HE COULD NOT MASTER
408-122806-0013 AND HE THOUGHT THAT A STRANGE LUSTRE CAME FROM THE OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE ALL THE FLOWERS SHONE LIKE FLAMES IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COLORS AND IN THE MIDST OF THE FLOWERS STOOD A SLENDER GRACEFUL MAIDEN
408-122806-0014 IT WAS AS IF SHE ALSO SHONE THE LIGHT REALLY HURT HIS EYES
408-122806-0015 YES HE WAS QUITE AWAKE WITH ONE SPRING HE WAS ON THE FLOOR HE CREPT GENTLY BEHIND THE CURTAIN BUT THE MAIDEN WAS GONE THE FLOWERS SHONE NO LONGER BUT THERE THEY STOOD FRESH AND BLOOMING AS EVER
408-122806-0016 THE DOOR WAS AJAR AND FAR WITHIN THE MUSIC SOUNDED SO SOFT AND DELIGHTFUL ONE COULD REALLY MELT AWAY IN SWEET THOUGHTS FROM IT YET IT WAS LIKE A PIECE OF ENCHANTMENT
408-122806-0017 AND WHO LIVED THERE WHERE WAS THE ACTUAL ENTRANCE THE WHOLE OF THE GROUND FLOOR WAS A ROW OF SHOPS AND THERE PEOPLE COULD NOT ALWAYS BE RUNNING THROUGH ONE EVENING THE STRANGER SAT OUT ON THE BALCONY
408-122806-0018 THE LIGHT BURNT IN THE ROOM BEHIND HIM AND THUS IT WAS QUITE NATURAL THAT HIS SHADOW SHOULD FALL ON HIS OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S WALL YES THERE IT SAT DIRECTLY OPPOSITE BETWEEN THE FLOWERS ON THE BALCONY
408-122806-0019 COME NOW BE USEFUL AND DO ME A SERVICE SAID HE IN JEST HAVE THE KINDNESS TO STEP IN NOW ART THOU GOING AND THEN HE NODDED TO THE SHADOW AND THE SHADOW NODDED AGAIN
408-122806-0020 WELL THEN GO BUT DON'T STAY AWAY THE STRANGER ROSE AND HIS SHADOW ON THE OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S BALCONY ROSE ALSO
408-122806-0021 AND THE SHADOW ALSO TURNED ROUND YES IF ANYONE HAD PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO IT THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN QUITE DISTINCTLY THAT THE SHADOW WENT IN THROUGH THE HALF OPEN BALCONY DOOR OF THEIR OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR
408-122806-0022 JUST AS THE STRANGER WENT INTO HIS OWN ROOM AND LET THE LONG CURTAIN FALL DOWN AFTER HIM NEXT MORNING THE LEARNED MAN WENT OUT TO DRINK COFFEE AND READ THE NEWSPAPERS WHAT
408-122806-0023 I HAVE NO SHADOW SO THEN IT HAS ACTUALLY GONE LAST NIGHT AND NOT COME AGAIN IT IS REALLY TIRESOME THIS ANNOYED HIM NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE THE SHADOW WAS GONE
408-122806-0024 BUT BECAUSE HE KNEW THERE WAS A STORY ABOUT A MAN WITHOUT A SHADOW IT WAS KNOWN TO EVERYBODY AT HOME IN THE COLD LANDS AND IF THE LEARNED MAN NOW CAME THERE AND TOLD HIS STORY
408-122806-0025 FOR HE KNEW THAT THE SHADOW WOULD ALWAYS HAVE ITS MASTER FOR A SCREEN BUT HE COULD NOT ENTICE IT HE MADE HIMSELF LITTLE HE MADE HIMSELF GREAT BUT NO SHADOW CAME AGAIN HE SAID HEM HEM
408-122806-0026 BUT IT WAS OF NO USE IT WAS VEXATIOUS BUT IN THE WARM LANDS EVERYTHING GROWS SO QUICKLY AND AFTER THE LAPSE OF EIGHT DAYS HE OBSERVED TO HIS GREAT JOY THAT A NEW SHADOW CAME IN THE SUNSHINE
408-122806-0027 IN THE COURSE OF THREE WEEKS HE HAD A VERY FAIR SHADOW WHICH WHEN HE SET OUT FOR HIS HOME IN THE NORTHERN LANDS GREW MORE AND MORE IN THE JOURNEY SO THAT AT LAST IT WAS SO LONG AND SO LARGE
408-122806-0028 THAT IT WAS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT THE LEARNED MAN THEN CAME HOME AND HE WROTE BOOKS ABOUT WHAT WAS TRUE IN THE WORLD AND ABOUT WHAT WAS GOOD AND WHAT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND THERE PASSED DAYS AND YEARS
408-122806-0029 ONE EVENING AS HE WAS SITTING IN HIS ROOM THERE WAS A GENTLE KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
408-122806-0030 BUT NO ONE CAME IN SO HE OPENED THE DOOR AND THERE STOOD BEFORE HIM SUCH AN EXTREMELY LEAN MAN THAT HE FELT QUITE STRANGE AS TO THE REST THE MAN WAS VERY FINELY DRESSED HE MUST BE A GENTLEMAN
408-122806-0031 ASKED THE LEARNED MAN YES I THOUGHT AS MUCH SAID THE FINE MAN I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NOT KNOW ME I HAVE GOT SO MUCH BODY I HAVE EVEN GOT FLESH AND CLOTHES

408-122806-0034 IN THE THICK GOLD CHAIN HE WORE AROUND HIS NECK NAY HOW ALL HIS FINGERS GLITTERED WITH DIAMOND RINGS AND THEN ALL WERE PURE GEMS NAY I CANNOT RECOVER FROM MY SURPRISE SAID THE LEARNED MAN
408-122806-0035 BUT YOU YOURSELF DO NOT BELONG TO THE COMMON ORDER AND I AS YOU KNOW WELL HAVE FROM A CHILD FOLLOWED IN YOUR FOOTSTEPS AS SOON AS YOU FOUND I WAS CAPABLE TO GO OUT ALONE IN THE WORLD I WENT MY OWN WAY
408-122806-0036 I AM IN THE MOST BRILLIANT CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THERE CAME A SORT OF DESIRE OVER ME TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE BEFORE YOU DIE YOU WILL DIE I SUPPOSE I ALSO WISHED TO SEE THIS LAND AGAIN

408-122806-0044 AND THE SHADOW ON THE GROUND KEPT ITSELF SO STILL AND QUIET THAT IT MIGHT HEAR ALL THAT PASSED IT WISHED TO KNOW HOW IT COULD GET FREE AND WORK ITS WAY UP SO AS TO BECOME ITS OWN MASTER
408-122806-0045 DO YOU KNOW WHO LIVED IN OUR OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE SAID THE SHADOW IT WAS THE MOST CHARMING OF ALL BEINGS IT WAS POESY I WAS THERE FOR THREE WEEKS

408-122806-0055 I LEARNED TO KNOW MY INWARD NATURE MY INNATE QUALITIES THE RELATIONSHIP I HAD WITH POESY AT THE TIME I WAS WITH YOU I THOUGHT NOT OF THAT BUT ALWAYS YOU KNOW IT WELL
408-122806-0056 WHEN THE SUN ROSE AND WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN I BECAME SO STRANGELY GREAT IN THE MOONLIGHT I WAS VERY NEAR BEING MORE DISTINCT THAN YOURSELF AT THAT TIME I DID NOT UNDERSTAND MY NATURE
408-122806-0057 I BECAME A MAN I CAME OUT MATURED BUT YOU WERE NO LONGER IN THE WARM LANDS AS A MAN I WAS ASHAMED TO GO AS I DID I WAS IN WANT OF BOOTS OF CLOTHES
408-122806-0058 OF THE WHOLE HUMAN VARNISH THAT MAKES A MAN PERCEPTIBLE I TOOK MY WAY I TELL IT TO YOU BUT YOU WILL NOT PUT IT IN ANY BOOK I TOOK MY WAY TO THE CAKE WOMAN I HID MYSELF BEHIND HER

408-122806-0060 I RAN UP AND RAN DOWN PEEPED INTO THE HIGHEST WINDOWS INTO THE SALOONS AND ON THE ROOFS I PEEPED IN WHERE NO ONE COULD PEEP AND I SAW WHAT NO ONE ELSE SAW WHAT NO ONE ELSE SHOULD SEE
408-122806-0061 THIS IS IN FACT A BASE WORLD I WOULD NOT BE A MAN IF IT WERE NOT NOW ONCE ACCEPTED AND REGARDED AS SOMETHING TO BE SO I SAW THE MOST UNIMAGINABLE THINGS WITH THE WOMEN WITH THE MEN
408-122806-0062 WITH PARENTS AND WITH THE SWEET MATCHLESS CHILDREN I SAW SAID THE SHADOW WHAT NO HUMAN BEING MUST KNOW BUT WHAT THEY WOULD ALL SO WILLINGLY KNOW WHAT IS BAD IN THEIR NEIGHBOR
408-122806-0063 HAD I WRITTEN A NEWSPAPER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN READ
408-122806-0064 THE MASTER OF THE MINT STRUCK NEW COIN FOR ME AND THE WOMEN SAID I WAS SO HANDSOME AND SO I BECAME THE MAN I AM
408-122806-0065 HERE IS MY CARD I LIVE ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET AND AM ALWAYS AT HOME IN RAINY WEATHER AND SO AWAY WENT THE SHADOW THAT WAS MOST EXTRAORDINARY SAID THE LEARNED MAN
408-122806-0066 THEN THE SHADOW CAME AGAIN HOW GOES IT SAID THE SHADOW ALAS SAID THE LEARNED MAN I WRITE ABOUT THE TRUE AND THE GOOD AND THE BEAUTIFUL BUT NO ONE CARES TO HEAR SUCH THINGS I AM QUITE DESPERATE
408-122806-0067 FOR I TAKE IT SO MUCH TO HEART BUT I DON'T SAID THE SHADOW I BECOME FAT AND IT IS THAT ONE WANTS TO BECOME YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE WORLD YOU WILL BECOME ILL BY IT YOU MUST TRAVEL
408-122806-0068 WAS NOT AT ALL IN THE MOST ENVIABLE STATE GRIEF AND TORMENT FOLLOWED HIM AND WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE TRUE AND THE GOOD AND THE BEAUTIFUL WAS TO MOST PERSONS LIKE ROSES FOR A COW HE WAS QUITE ILL AT LAST
408-122806-0069 YOU REALLY LOOK LIKE A SHADOW SAID HIS FRIENDS TO HIM AND THE LEARNED MAN TREMBLED FOR HE THOUGHT OF IT YOU MUST GO TO A WATERING PLACE SAID THE SHADOW WHO CAME AND VISITED HIM THERE IS NOTHING ELSE FOR IT
408-122806-0070 I WILL TAKE YOU WITH ME FOR OLD ACQUAINTANCE SAKE I WILL PAY THE TRAVELLING EXPENSES AND YOU WRITE THE DESCRIPTIONS AND IF THEY ARE A LITTLE AMUSING FOR ME ON THE WAY I WILL GO TO A WATERING PLACE
408-122806-0071 MY BEARD DOES NOT GROW OUT AS IT OUGHT THAT IS ALSO A SICKNESS AND ONE MUST HAVE A BEARD NOW YOU BE WISE AND ACCEPT THE OFFER WE SHALL TRAVEL AS COMRADES AND SO THEY TRAVELLED
408-122806-0072 THE SHADOW WAS MASTER AND THE MASTER WAS THE SHADOW THEY DROVE WITH EACH OTHER THEY RODE AND WALKED TOGETHER SIDE BY SIDE BEFORE AND BEHIND JUST AS THE SUN WAS
408-122806-0073 THE SHADOW ALWAYS TOOK CARE TO KEEP ITSELF IN THE MASTER'S PLACE NOW THE LEARNED MAN DIDN'T THINK MUCH ABOUT THAT HE WAS A VERY KIND HEARTED MAN AND PARTICULARLY MILD AND FRIENDLY AND SO HE SAID ONE DAY TO THE SHADOW
408-122806-0074 AS WE HAVE NOW BECOME COMPANIONS AND IN THIS WAY HAVE GROWN UP TOGETHER FROM CHILDHOOD SHALL WE NOT DRINK THOU TOGETHER IT IS MORE FAMILIAR YOU ARE RIGHT SAID THE SHADOW WHO WAS NOW THE PROPER MASTER
408-122806-0075 IT IS SAID IN A VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD AND WELL MEANT MANNER YOU AS A LEARNED MAN CERTAINLY KNOW HOW STRANGE NATURE IS SOME PERSONS CANNOT BEAR TO TOUCH GREY PAPER OR THEY BECOME ILL
408-122806-0076 YOU SEE THAT IT IS A FEELING THAT IT IS NOT PRIDE I CANNOT ALLOW YOU TO SAY THOU TO ME BUT I WILL WILLINGLY SAY THOU TO YOU SO IT IS HALF DONE SO THE SHADOW SAID THOU TO ITS FORMER MASTER
408-122806-0077 THIS IS RATHER TOO BAD THOUGHT HE THAT I MUST SAY YOU AND HE SAY THOU BUT HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PUT UP WITH IT SO THEY CAME TO A WATERING PLACE WHERE THERE WERE MANY STRANGERS
408-122806-0078 AND AMONGST THEM WAS A PRINCESS WHO WAS TROUBLED WITH SEEING TOO WELL AND THAT WAS SO ALARMING SHE DIRECTLY OBSERVED THAT THE STRANGER WHO HAD JUST COME WAS QUITE A DIFFERENT SORT OF PERSON TO ALL THE OTHERS
408-122806-0079 HE HAS COME HERE IN ORDER TO GET HIS BEARD TO GROW THEY SAY BUT I SEE THE REAL CAUSE HE CANNOT CAST A SHADOW SHE HAD BECOME INQUISITIVE
408-122806-0080 AND SO SHE ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION DIRECTLY WITH THE STRANGE GENTLEMAN ON THEIR PROMENADES AS THE DAUGHTER OF A KING SHE NEEDED NOT TO STAND UPON TRIFLES SO SHE SAID YOUR COMPLAINT IS
408-122806-0081 THAT YOU CANNOT CAST A SHADOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS MUST BE IMPROVING CONSIDERABLY SAID THE SHADOW I KNOW YOUR COMPLAINT IS THAT YOU SEE TOO CLEARLY BUT IT HAS DECREASED YOU ARE CURED
408-122806-0082 I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE A VERY UNUSUAL SHADOW DO YOU NOT SEE THAT PERSON WHO ALWAYS GOES WITH ME OTHER PERSONS HAVE A COMMON SHADOW BUT I DO NOT LIKE WHAT IS COMMON TO ALL
408-122806-0083 YES YOU SEE I HAVE EVEN GIVEN HIM A SHADOW IT IS SOMEWHAT EXPENSIVE BUT I LIKE TO HAVE SOMETHING FOR MYSELF WHAT THOUGHT THE PRINCESS SHOULD I REALLY BE CURED THESE BATHS ARE THE FIRST IN THE WORLD
408-122806-0084 IN OUR TIME WATER HAS WONDERFUL POWERS
408-122806-0085 FOR IT NOW BEGINS TO BE AMUSING HERE I AM EXTREMELY FOND OF THAT STRANGER WOULD THAT HIS BEARD SHOULD NOT GROW FOR IN THAT CASE HE WILL LEAVE US IN THE EVENING THE PRINCESS AND THE SHADOW DANCED TOGETHER
408-122806-0086 IN THE LARGE BALL ROOM SHE WAS LIGHT BUT HE WAS STILL LIGHTER SHE HAD NEVER HAD SUCH A PARTNER IN THE DANCE SHE TOLD HIM FROM WHAT LAND SHE CAME AND HE KNEW THAT LAND HE HAD BEEN THERE
408-122806-0087 BUT THEN SHE WAS NOT AT HOME HE HAD PEEPED IN AT THE WINDOW ABOVE AND BELOW HE HAD SEEN BOTH THE ONE AND THE OTHER AND SO HE COULD ANSWER THE PRINCESS AND MAKE INSINUATIONS
408-122806-0088 SO THAT SHE WAS QUITE ASTONISHED HE MUST BE THE WISEST MAN IN THE WHOLE WORLD SHE FELT SUCH RESPECT FOR WHAT HE KNEW SO THAT WHEN THEY AGAIN DANCED TOGETHER SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM
408-122806-0089 AND THAT THE SHADOW COULD REMARK FOR SHE ALMOST PIERCED HIM THROUGH WITH HER EYES SO THEY DANCED ONCE MORE TOGETHER AND SHE WAS ABOUT TO DECLARE HERSELF BUT SHE WAS DISCREET SHE THOUGHT OF HER COUNTRY AND KINGDOM
408-122806-0090 AND OF THE MANY PERSONS SHE WOULD HAVE TO REIGN OVER HE IS A WISE MAN
408-122806-0091 THEY BELONG TO MY CHILDHOOD'S LEARNING SAID THE SHADOW I REALLY BELIEVE MY SHADOW BY THE DOOR THERE CAN ANSWER THEM YOUR SHADOW SAID THE PRINCESS THAT WOULD INDEED BE MARVELLOUS
408-122806-0092 I WILL NOT SAY FOR A CERTAINTY THAT HE CAN SAID THE SHADOW BUT I THINK SO HE HAS NOW FOLLOWED ME FOR SO MANY YEARS AND LISTENED TO MY CONVERSATION I SHOULD THINK IT POSSIBLE
408-122806-0093 BUT YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL PERMIT ME TO OBSERVE THAT HE IS SO PROUD OF PASSING HIMSELF OFF FOR A MAN THAT WHEN HE IS TO BE IN A PROPER HUMOR AND HE MUST BE SO TO ANSWER WELL HE MUST BE TREATED QUITE LIKE A MAN
408-122806-0094 OH I LIKE THAT SAID THE PRINCESS SO SHE WENT TO THE LEARNED MAN BY THE DOOR AND SHE SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT THE SUN AND THE MOON AND ABOUT PERSONS OUT OF AND IN THE WORLD AND HE ANSWERED WITH WISDOM AND PRUDENCE
408-122806-0095 WHAT A MAN THAT MUST BE WHO HAS SO WISE A SHADOW THOUGHT SHE IT WILL BE A REAL BLESSING TO MY PEOPLE AND KINGDOM IF I CHOOSE HIM FOR MY CONSORT I WILL DO IT THEY WERE SOON AGREED
408-122806-0096 BOTH THE PRINCESS AND THE SHADOW BUT NO ONE WAS TO KNOW ABOUT IT BEFORE SHE ARRIVED IN HER OWN KINGDOM NO ONE NOT EVEN MY SHADOW SAID THE SHADOW AND HE HAD HIS OWN THOUGHTS ABOUT IT
408-122806-0097 NOW THEY WERE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE THE PRINCESS REIGNED WHEN SHE WAS AT HOME LISTEN MY GOOD FRIEND SAID THE SHADOW TO THE LEARNED MAN I HAVE NOW BECOME AS HAPPY AND MIGHTY AS ANYONE CAN BE
