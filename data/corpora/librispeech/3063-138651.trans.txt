3063-138651-0004 IT WAS A DAY OF DAYS ANNE WORE HER CELEBRATED CELESTIAL BLUE PELISSE HER LEGHORN HAT AND HER MUSLIN DRESS WITH THE WAIST UNDER THE ARMS
3063-138651-0005 THE LATTER BEING DECORATED WITH EXCELLENT HONITON LACE BOUGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO TRAVELLED FROM THAT PLACE TO OVERCOMBE AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD WITH A BASKETFUL OF HER OWN MANUFACTURE AND A CUSHION ON WHICH SHE WORKED BY THE WAYSIDE JOHN MET THE LOVERS AT THE INN OUTSIDE THE TOWN
3063-138651-0006 AND AFTER STABLING THE HORSE THEY ENTERED THE TOWN TOGETHER THE TRUMPET MAJOR INFORMING THEM THAT THE WATERING PLACE HAD NEVER BEEN SO FULL BEFORE THAT THE COURT THE PRINCE OF WALES AND EVERYBODY OF CONSEQUENCE WAS THERE AND THAT AN ATTIC COULD SCARCELY BE GOT FOR MONEY
3063-138651-0007 THE KING HAD GONE FOR A CRUISE IN HIS YACHT AND THEY WOULD BE IN TIME TO SEE HIM LAND THEN DRUMS AND FIFES WERE HEARD AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO THEY SAW SERGEANT STANNER ADVANCING ALONG THE STREET WITH A FIRM COUNTENANCE
3063-138651-0008 FIERY POLL AND RIGID STARING EYES IN FRONT OF HIS RECRUITING PARTY THE SERGEANT'S SWORD WAS DRAWN AND AT INTERVALS OF TWO OR THREE INCHES ALONG ITS SHINING BLADE WERE IMPALED FLUTTERING ONE POUND NOTES TO EXPRESS THE LAVISH BOUNTY THAT WAS OFFERED
3063-138651-0009 HE GAVE A STERN SUPPRESSED NOD OF FRIENDSHIP TO OUR PEOPLE AND PASSED BY NEXT THEY CAME UP TO A WAGGON BOWERED OVER WITH LEAVES AND FLOWERS SO THAT THE MEN INSIDE COULD HARDLY BE SEEN COME TO SEE THE KING HIP HIP HURRAH CRIED A VOICE WITHIN
3063-138651-0010 AND TURNING THEY SAW THROUGH THE LEAVES THE NOSE AND FACE OF CRIPPLESTRAW THE WAGGON CONTAINED ALL DERRIMAN'S WORKPEOPLE IS YOUR MASTER HERE SAID JOHN NO TRUMPET MAJOR SIR BUT YOUNG MAISTER IS COMING TO FETCH US AT NINE O'CLOCK IN CASE WE SHOULD BE TOO BLIND TO DRIVE HOME
3063-138651-0011 O WHERE IS HE NOW NEVER MIND SAID ANNE IMPATIENTLY AT WHICH THE TRUMPET MAJOR OBEDIENTLY MOVED ON BY THE TIME THEY REACHED THE PIER IT WAS SIX O'CLOCK THE ROYAL YACHT WAS RETURNING A FACT ANNOUNCED BY THE SHIPS IN THE HARBOUR FIRING A SALUTE
3063-138651-0012 THE KING CAME ASHORE WITH HIS HAT IN HIS HAND AND RETURNED THE SALUTATIONS OF THE WELL DRESSED CROWD IN HIS OLD INDISCRIMINATE FASHION WHILE THIS CHEERING AND WAVING OF HANDKERCHIEFS WAS GOING ON
3063-138651-0013 AS IF SHE WERE A DELICATE PIECE OF STATUARY THAT A PUSH MIGHT DAMAGE SOON THE KING HAD PASSED AND RECEIVING THE MILITARY SALUTES OF THE PIQUET JOINED THE QUEEN AND PRINCESSES AT GLOUCESTER LODGE THE HOMELY HOUSE OF RED BRICK IN WHICH HE UNOSTENTATIOUSLY RESIDED
3063-138651-0014 AS THERE WAS YET SOME LITTLE TIME BEFORE THE THEATRE WOULD OPEN
3063-138651-0015 THEY RETURNED TO GLOUCESTER LODGE WHENCE THE KING AND OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY NOW REAPPEARED AND DROVE AT A SLOW TROT ROUND TO THE THEATRE IN CARRIAGES DRAWN BY THE HANOVERIAN WHITE HORSES THAT WERE SO WELL KNOWN IN THE TOWN AT THIS DATE
3063-138651-0016 WHEN ANNE AND BOB ENTERED THE THEATRE THEY FOUND THAT JOHN HAD TAKEN EXCELLENT PLACES AND CONCLUDED THAT HE HAD GOT THEM FOR NOTHING THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF THE LADY OF HIS CHOICE AS A MATTER OF FACT HE HAD PAID FULL PRICES FOR THOSE TWO SEATS LIKE ANY OTHER OUTSIDER
3063-138651-0017 AND EVEN THEN HAD A DIFFICULTY IN GETTING THEM IT BEING A KING'S NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE SETTLED HE HIMSELF RETIRED TO AN OBSCURE PART OF THE PIT FROM WHICH THE STAGE WAS SCARCELY VISIBLE WE CAN SEE BEAUTIFULLY SAID BOB IN AN ARISTOCRATIC VOICE
3063-138651-0018 AS HE TOOK A DELICATE PINCH OF SNUFF AND DREW OUT THE MAGNIFICENT POCKET HANDKERCHIEF BROUGHT HOME FROM THE EAST FOR SUCH OCCASIONS BUT I AM AFRAID POOR JOHN CAN'T SEE AT ALL BUT WE CAN SEE HIM REPLIED ANNE AND NOTICE BY HIS FACE WHICH OF THEM
3063-138651-0019 IT IS HE IS SO CHARMED WITH THE LIGHT OF THAT CORNER CANDLE FALLS RIGHT UPON HIS CHEEK BY THIS TIME THE KING HAD APPEARED IN HIS PLACE WHICH WAS OVERHUNG BY A CANOPY OF CRIMSON SATIN FRINGED WITH GOLD
3063-138651-0020 ABOUT TWENTY PLACES WERE OCCUPIED BY THE ROYAL FAMILY AND SUITE AND BEYOND THEM WAS A CROWD OF POWDERED AND GLITTERING PERSONAGES OF FASHION COMPLETELY FILLING THE CENTRE OF THE LITTLE BUILDING THOUGH THE KING SO FREQUENTLY PATRONIZED THE LOCAL STAGE DURING THESE YEARS THAT THE CRUSH WAS NOT INCONVENIENT
3063-138651-0021 TO NIGHT IT WAS ONE OF COLMAN'S WHO AT THIS TIME ENJOYED GREAT POPULARITY AND MISTER BANNISTER SUPPORTED THE LEADING CHARACTER ANNE WITH HER HAND PRIVATELY CLASPED IN BOB'S AND LOOKING AS IF SHE DID NOT KNOW IT
3063-138651-0022 SHE HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT WHEN A CERTAIN ONE OF THE SUBORDINATE LADIES OF THE COMEDY ENTERED ON THE STAGE THE TRUMPET MAJOR IN HIS CORNER NOT ONLY LOOKED CONSCIOUS BUT STARTED AND GAZED WITH PARTED LIPS THIS MUST BE THE ONE WHISPERED ANNE QUICKLY
3063-138651-0023 SEE HE IS AGITATED SHE TURNED TO BOB BUT AT THE SAME MOMENT HIS HAND CONVULSIVELY CLOSED UPON HERS AS HE TOO STRANGELY FIXED HIS EYES UPON THE NEWLY ENTERED LADY WHAT IS IT
3063-138651-0024 ANNE LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER WITHOUT REGARDING THE STAGE AT ALL HER ANSWER CAME IN THE VOICE OF THE ACTRESS WHO NOW SPOKE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE ACCENTS WERE THOSE OF MISS MATILDA JOHNSON ONE THOUGHT RUSHED INTO BOTH THEIR MINDS ON THE INSTANT
3063-138651-0025 AND BOB WAS THE FIRST TO UTTER IT WHAT IS SHE THE WOMAN OF HIS CHOICE AFTER ALL IF SO IT IS A DREADFUL THING MURMURED ANNE BUT AS MAY BE IMAGINED THE UNFORTUNATE JOHN WAS AS MUCH SURPRISED BY THIS RENCOUNTER AS THE OTHER TWO
3063-138651-0026 UNTIL THIS MOMENT HE HAD BEEN IN UTTER IGNORANCE OF THE THEATRICAL COMPANY AND ALL THAT PERTAINED TO IT MOREOVER MUCH AS HE KNEW OF MISS JOHNSON HE WAS NOT AWARE THAT SHE HAD EVER BEEN TRAINED IN HER YOUTH AS AN ACTRESS
3063-138651-0027 THE TRUMPET MAJOR THOUGH NOT PROMINENTLY SEATED HAD BEEN SEEN BY MATILDA ALREADY WHO HAD OBSERVED STILL MORE PLAINLY HER OLD BETROTHED AND ANNE IN THE OTHER PART OF THE HOUSE JOHN WAS NOT CONCERNED ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT AT
3063-138651-0028 BEING FACE TO FACE WITH HER BUT AT THE EXTRAORDINARY SUSPICION THAT THIS CONJUNCTURE MUST REVIVE IN THE MINDS OF HIS BEST BELOVED FRIENDS AFTER SOME MOMENTS OF PAINED REFLECTION HE TAPPED HIS KNEE GAD I WON'T EXPLAIN IT SHALL GO AS IT IS
3063-138651-0029 HE SAID LET THEM THINK HER MINE
3063-138651-0030 HAD PERSONAL PROMINENCE IN THE SCENE BEEN AT THIS MOMENT PROPORTIONED TO INTENTNESS OF FEELING THE WHOLE AUDIENCE REGAL AND OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE FADED INTO AN INDISTINCT MIST OF BACKGROUND LEAVING AS THE SOLE EMERGENT AND TELLING FIGURES BOB AND ANNE AT ONE POINT
3063-138651-0031 BUT FORTUNATELY THE DEADLOCK OF AWKWARD SUSPENSE INTO WHICH ALL FOUR HAD FALLEN WAS TERMINATED BY AN ACCIDENT A MESSENGER ENTERED THE KING'S BOX WITH DESPATCHES THERE WAS AN INSTANT PAUSE IN THE PERFORMANCE
3063-138651-0032 THE DESPATCH BOX BEING OPENED THE KING READ FOR A FEW MOMENTS WITH GREAT INTEREST THE EYES OF THE WHOLE HOUSE INCLUDING THOSE OF ANNE GARLAND BEING ANXIOUSLY FIXED UPON HIS FACE FOR TERRIBLE EVENTS
3063-138651-0033 FELL AS UNEXPECTEDLY AS THUNDERBOLTS AT THIS CRITICAL TIME OF OUR HISTORY THE KING AT LENGTH BECKONED TO LORD WHO WAS IMMEDIATELY BEHIND HIM THE PLAY WAS AGAIN STOPPED AND THE CONTENTS OF THE DESPATCH WERE PUBLICLY COMMUNICATED TO THE AUDIENCE
3063-138651-0034 SIR ROBERT CALDER CRUISING OFF FINISTERRE HAD COME IN SIGHT OF VILLENEUVE AND MADE THE SIGNAL FOR ACTION WHICH THOUGH CHECKED BY THE WEATHER HAD RESULTED IN THE CAPTURE OF TWO SPANISH LINE OF BATTLE SHIPS
3063-138651-0035 THE NEWS WAS RECEIVED WITH TRULY NATIONAL FEELING IF NOISE MIGHT BE TAKEN AS AN INDEX OF PATRIOTISM RULE BRITANNIA WAS CALLED FOR AND SUNG BY THE WHOLE HOUSE BUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE EVENT WAS FAR FROM BEING RECOGNIZED AT THIS TIME
3063-138651-0036 AND BOB LOVEDAY AS HE SAT THERE AND HEARD IT HAD VERY LITTLE CONCEPTION HOW IT WOULD BEAR UPON HIS DESTINY THIS PARENTHETIC EXCITEMENT DIVERTED FOR A FEW MINUTES THE EYES OF BOB AND ANNE FROM THE TRUMPET MAJOR AND WHEN THE PLAY PROCEEDED AND THEY LOOKED BACK TO HIS CORNER HE WAS GONE
3063-138651-0037 HE'S JUST SLIPPED ROUND TO TALK TO HER BEHIND THE SCENES SAID BOB KNOWINGLY SHALL WE GO TOO AND TEASE HIM FOR A SLY DOG NO I WOULD RATHER NOT SHALL WE GO HOME THEN NOT UNLESS HER PRESENCE IS TOO MUCH FOR YOU
3063-138651-0038 AH THERE SHE IS AGAIN THEY SAT ON AND LISTENED TO MATILDA'S SPEECHES WHICH SHE DELIVERED WITH SUCH DELIGHTFUL COOLNESS THAT THEY SOON BEGAN TO CONSIDERABLY INTEREST ONE OF THE PARTY
3063-138651-0039 WELL WHAT A NERVE THE YOUNG WOMAN HAS HE SAID AT LAST IN TONES OF ADMIRATION AND GAZING AT MISS JOHNSON WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AFTER ALL JACK'S TASTE IS NOT SO BAD SHE'S REALLY DEUCED CLEVER BOB I'LL GO HOME IF YOU WISH TO SAID ANNE QUICKLY
3063-138651-0040 O NO LET US SEE HOW SHE FLEETS HERSELF OFF THAT BIT OF A SCRAPE SHE'S PLAYING AT NOW WELL WHAT A HAND SHE IS AT IT TO BE SURE ANNE SAID NO MORE BUT WAITED ON SUPREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE AND ALMOST TEARFUL
3063-138651-0041 SHE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT SHE DID NOT LIKE LIFE PARTICULARLY WELL IT WAS TOO COMPLICATED SHE SAW NOTHING OF THE SCENE AND ONLY LONGED TO GET AWAY AND TO GET BOB AWAY WITH HER AT LAST THE CURTAIN FELL ON THE FINAL ACT AND THEN BEGAN THE FARCE OF NO SONG NO SUPPER
3063-138651-0042 MATILDA DID NOT APPEAR IN THIS PIECE AND ANNE AGAIN INQUIRED IF THEY SHOULD GO HOME THIS TIME BOB AGREED AND TAKING HER UNDER HIS CARE WITH REDOUBLED AFFECTION TO MAKE UP FOR THE SPECIES OF COMA WHICH HAD SEIZED UPON HIS HEART FOR A TIME HE QUIETLY ACCOMPANIED HER OUT OF THE HOUSE
3063-138651-0043 WHEN THEY EMERGED UPON THE ESPLANADE THE AUGUST MOON WAS SHINING ACROSS THE SEA FROM THE DIRECTION OF SAINT ALDHELM'S HEAD BOB UNCONSCIOUSLY LOITERED AND TURNED TOWARDS THE PIER REACHING THE END OF THE PROMENADE THEY SURVEYED THE QUIVERING WATERS IN SILENCE FOR SOME TIME
3063-138651-0044 AND SWEPT FORWARD INTO THE HARBOUR WHAT BOAT IS THAT SAID ANNE IT SEEMS TO BE SOME FRIGATE LYING IN THE ROADS SAID BOB CARELESSLY AS HE BROUGHT ANNE ROUND WITH A GENTLE PRESSURE OF HIS ARM AND BENT HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE HOMEWARD END OF THE TOWN
3063-138651-0045 MEANWHILE MISS JOHNSON HAVING FINISHED HER DUTIES FOR THAT EVENING RAPIDLY CHANGED HER DRESS AND WENT OUT LIKEWISE THE PROMINENT POSITION WHICH ANNE AND CAPTAIN BOB HAD OCCUPIED SIDE BY SIDE IN THE THEATRE
3063-138651-0046 LEFT HER NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO SUPPOSE THAT THE SITUATION WAS ARRANGED BY BOB AS A SPECIES OF DEFIANCE TO HERSELF AND HER HEART SUCH AS IT WAS BECAME PROPORTIONATELY EMBITTERED AGAINST HIM
3063-138651-0047 IN SPITE OF THE RISE IN HER FORTUNES MISS JOHNSON STILL REMEMBERED AND ALWAYS WOULD REMEMBER HER HUMILIATING DEPARTURE FROM OVERCOMBE AND IT HAD BEEN TO HER EVEN A MORE GRIEVOUS THING THAT BOB HAD ACQUIESCED IN HIS BROTHER'S RULING THAN THAT JOHN HAD DETERMINED IT
3063-138651-0048 AT THE TIME OF SETTING OUT SHE WAS SUSTAINED BY A FIRM FAITH THAT BOB WOULD FOLLOW HER AND NULLIFY HIS BROTHER'S SCHEME BUT THOUGH SHE WAITED BOB NEVER CAME SHE PASSED ALONG BY THE HOUSES FACING THE SEA AND SCANNED THE SHORE
3063-138651-0049 THE FOOTWAY AND THE OPEN ROAD CLOSE TO HER WHICH ILLUMINATED BY THE SLANTING MOON TO A GREAT BRIGHTNESS SPARKLED WITH MINUTE FACETS OF CRYSTALLIZED SALTS FROM THE WATER SPRINKLED THERE DURING THE DAY THE PROMENADERS AT THE FURTHER EDGE APPEARED IN DARK PROFILES
3063-138651-0050 AND BEYOND THEM WAS THE GREY SEA PARTED INTO TWO MASSES BY THE TAPERING BRAID OF MOONLIGHT ACROSS THE WAVES TWO FORMS CROSSED THIS LINE AT A STARTLING NEARNESS TO HER SHE MARKED THEM AT ONCE AS ANNE AND BOB LOVEDAY THEY WERE WALKING SLOWLY
