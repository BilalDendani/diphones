2919-7270-0000 NOT THE FACT BUT THE WORDS THE WORDS CHARGED WITH THE SHADOWY MIGHT OF A MEANING THAT SEEMED TO POSSESS THE TREMENDOUS POWER TO CALL FATE DOWN UPON THE EARTH LIKE THOSE STRANGE AND APPALLING WORDS
2919-7270-0001 THAT SOMETIMES ARE HEARD IN SLEEP THEY VIBRATED ROUND HIM IN A METALLIC ATMOSPHERE IN A SPACE THAT HAD THE HARDNESS OF IRON AND THE RESONANCE OF A BELL OF BRONZE LOOKING DOWN BETWEEN THE TOES OF HIS BOOTS
2919-7270-0002 AND TRAVELLING AWAY WIDENING ENDLESSLY FAR VERY FAR WHERE HE COULD NOT HEAR WHERE HE COULD NOT IMAGINE ANYTHING WHERE AND WITH THAT ASS
2919-7270-0003 HE SAID AGAIN WITHOUT STIRRING IN THE LEAST AND THERE WAS NOTHING BUT HUMILIATION NOTHING ELSE HE COULD DERIVE NO MORAL SOLACE FROM ANY ASPECT OF THE SITUATION
2919-7270-0004 WHICH RADIATED PAIN ONLY ON EVERY SIDE PAIN WHAT KIND OF PAIN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE OUGHT TO BE HEART BROKEN BUT IN AN EXCEEDINGLY SHORT MOMENT
2919-7270-0005 HE PERCEIVED THAT HIS SUFFERING WAS NOTHING OF SO TRIFLING AND DIGNIFIED A KIND IT WAS ALTOGETHER A MORE SERIOUS MATTER AND PARTOOK RATHER OF THE NATURE OF THOSE SUBTLE AND CRUEL FEELINGS WHICH ARE AWAKENED BY A KICK OR A HORSE WHIPPING
2919-7270-0006 HE FELT VERY SICK PHYSICALLY SICK AS THOUGH HE HAD BITTEN THROUGH SOMETHING NAUSEOUS LIFE THAT TO A WELL ORDERED MIND SHOULD BE A MATTER OF CONGRATULATION
2919-7270-0007 APPEARED TO HIM FOR A SECOND OR SO PERFECTLY INTOLERABLE HE PICKED UP THE PAPER AT HIS FEET AND SAT DOWN WITH THE WISH TO THINK IT OUT TO UNDERSTAND WHY HIS WIFE HIS WIFE SHOULD LEAVE HIM SHOULD THROW AWAY RESPECT
2919-7270-0008 COMFORT PEACE DECENCY POSITION THROW AWAY EVERYTHING FOR NOTHING HE SET HIMSELF TO THINK OUT THE HIDDEN LOGIC OF HER ACTION A MENTAL UNDERTAKING FIT FOR THE LEISURE HOURS OF A MADHOUSE THOUGH HE COULDN'T SEE IT
2919-7270-0009 AND HE THOUGHT OF HIS WIFE IN EVERY RELATION EXCEPT THE ONLY FUNDAMENTAL ONE HE THOUGHT OF HER AS A WELL BRED GIRL AS A WIFE AS A CULTURED PERSON AS THE MISTRESS OF A HOUSE AS A LADY BUT HE NEVER FOR A MOMENT THOUGHT OF HER SIMPLY
2919-7270-0010 AS A WOMAN THEN A FRESH WAVE A RAGING WAVE OF HUMILIATION SWEPT THROUGH HIS MIND
2919-7270-0011 AND LEFT NOTHING THERE BUT A PERSONAL SENSE OF UNDESERVED ABASEMENT WHY SHOULD HE BE MIXED UP WITH SUCH A HORRID EXPOSURE
2919-7270-0012 BY A TRUTH EFFECTIVE AND UNJUST LIKE A CALUMNY AND THE PAST WAS WASTED ITS FAILURE WAS DISCLOSED A DISTINCT FAILURE ON HIS PART TO SEE TO GUARD TO UNDERSTAND IT COULD NOT BE DENIED IT COULD NOT BE EXPLAINED AWAY HUSTLED OUT OF SIGHT
2919-7270-0013 HE COULD NOT SIT ON IT AND LOOK SOLEMN NOW IF SHE HAD ONLY DIED IF SHE HAD ONLY DIED HE WAS DRIVEN TO ENVY SUCH A RESPECTABLE BEREAVEMENT
2919-7270-0014 AND ONE SO PERFECTLY FREE FROM ANY TAINT OF MISFORTUNE THAT EVEN HIS BEST FRIEND OR HIS BEST ENEMY WOULD NOT HAVE FELT THE SLIGHTEST THRILL OF EXULTATION NO ONE WOULD HAVE CARED HE SOUGHT COMFORT IN CLINGING TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE ONLY FACT OF LIFE
2919-7270-0015 THAT THE RESOLUTE EFFORTS OF MANKIND HAD NEVER FAILED TO DISGUISE IN THE CLATTER AND GLAMOUR OF PHRASES AND NOTHING LENDS ITSELF MORE TO LIES THAN DEATH IF SHE HAD ONLY DIED CERTAIN WORDS WOULD HAVE BEEN SAID TO HIM IN A SAD TONE AND HE WITH PROPER FORTITUDE
2919-7270-0016 WOULD HAVE MADE APPROPRIATE ANSWERS THERE WERE PRECEDENTS FOR SUCH AN OCCASION AND NO ONE WOULD HAVE CARED IF SHE HAD ONLY DIED
2919-7270-0017 AND LIFE WAS HIS CONCERN THAT SANE AND GRATIFYING EXISTENCE UNTROUBLED BY TOO MUCH LOVE OR BY TOO MUCH REGRET SHE HAD INTERFERED WITH IT SHE HAD DEFACED IT AND SUDDENLY IT OCCURRED TO HIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN MAD TO MARRY
2919-7270-0018 IT WAS TOO MUCH IN THE NATURE OF GIVING YOURSELF AWAY OF WEARING IF FOR A MOMENT YOUR HEART ON YOUR SLEEVE BUT EVERY ONE MARRIED WAS ALL MANKIND MAD
2919-7270-0019 IN THE SHOCK OF THAT STARTLING THOUGHT HE LOOKED UP AND SAW TO THE LEFT TO THE RIGHT IN FRONT MEN SITTING FAR OFF IN CHAIRS AND LOOKING AT HIM WITH WILD EYES
2919-7270-0020 EMISSARIES OF A DISTRACTED MANKIND INTRUDING TO SPY UPON HIS PAIN AND HIS HUMILIATION IT WAS NOT TO BE BORNE HE ROSE QUICKLY AND THE OTHERS JUMPED UP TOO ON ALL SIDES
2919-7270-0021 HE STOOD STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AS IF DISCOURAGED BY THEIR VIGILANCE NO ESCAPE HE FELT SOMETHING AKIN TO DESPAIR EVERYBODY MUST KNOW THE SERVANTS MUST KNOW TO NIGHT HE GROUND HIS TEETH AND HE HAD NEVER NOTICED
2919-7270-0022 NEVER GUESSED ANYTHING EVERY ONE WILL KNOW HE THOUGHT THE WOMAN'S A MONSTER BUT EVERYBODY WILL THINK ME A FOOL AND STANDING STILL IN THE MIDST OF SEVERE WALNUT WOOD FURNITURE
2919-7270-0023 SOMETHING UNKNOWN WITHERING AND POISONOUS HAD ENTERED HIS LIFE PASSED NEAR HIM TOUCHED HIM AND HE WAS DETERIORATING HE WAS APPALLED WHAT WAS IT SHE WAS GONE WHY
2919-7270-0024 EVERYTHING WAS CHANGED WHY ONLY A WOMAN GONE AFTER ALL AND YET HE HAD A VISION A VISION QUICK AND DISTINCT AS A DREAM
2919-7270-0025 THE VISION OF EVERYTHING HE HAD THOUGHT INDESTRUCTIBLE AND SAFE IN THE WORLD CRASHING DOWN ABOUT HIM LIKE SOLID WALLS DO BEFORE THE FIERCE BREATH OF A HURRICANE HE STARED SHAKING IN EVERY LIMB WHILE HE FELT THE DESTRUCTIVE BREATH
2919-7270-0026 THE MYSTERIOUS BREATH THE BREATH OF PASSION STIR THE PROFOUND PEACE OF THE HOUSE HE LOOKED ROUND IN FEAR YES CRIME MAY BE FORGIVEN UNCALCULATING SACRIFICE
2919-7270-0027 A THING TO CURSE TO HIDE AND TO DENY A SHAMELESS AND FORLORN THING THAT TRAMPLES UPON THE SMILING PROMISES THAT TEARS OFF THE PLACID MASK THAT STRIPS THE BODY OF LIFE AND IT HAD COME TO HIM
2919-7270-0028 IT HAD LAID ITS UNCLEAN HAND UPON THE SPOTLESS DRAPERIES OF HIS EXISTENCE AND HE HAD TO FACE IT ALONE WITH ALL THE WORLD LOOKING ON ALL THE WORLD AND HE THOUGHT THAT EVEN
2919-7270-0029 THE BARE SUSPICION OF SUCH AN ADVERSARY WITHIN HIS HOUSE CARRIED WITH IT A TAINT AND A CONDEMNATION HE PUT BOTH HIS HANDS OUT AS IF TO WARD OFF THE REPROACH OF A DEFILING TRUTH AND INSTANTLY
2919-7270-0030 HE GLANCED VAINLY HERE AND THERE LIKE A MAN LOOKING IN DESPERATION FOR A WEAPON OR FOR A HIDING PLACE
2919-7270-0031 WITHOUT ANY SQUEAMISHNESS WOULD STRIKE SO AS TO LAY OPEN HIS HEART HE COULD GET HELP NOWHERE OR EVEN TAKE COUNSEL WITH HIMSELF BECAUSE IN THE SUDDEN SHOCK OF HER DESERTION THE SENTIMENTS WHICH HE KNEW THAT IN FIDELITY TO HIS BRINGING UP
2919-7270-0032 HE OUGHT TO EXPERIENCE WERE SO MIXED UP WITH THE NOVELTY OF REAL FEELINGS OF FUNDAMENTAL FEELINGS THAT KNOW NOTHING OF CREED CLASS OR EDUCATION THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH CLEARLY BETWEEN WHAT IS AND WHAT OUGHT TO BE
2919-7270-0033 BETWEEN THE INEXCUSABLE TRUTH AND THE VALID PRETENCES AND HE KNEW INSTINCTIVELY THAT TRUTH WOULD BE OF NO USE TO HIM SOME KIND OF CONCEALMENT SEEMED A NECESSITY BECAUSE ONE CANNOT EXPLAIN OF COURSE NOT
2919-7270-0034 WHO WOULD LISTEN ONE HAD SIMPLY TO BE WITHOUT STAIN AND WITHOUT REPROACH TO KEEP ONE'S PLACE IN THE FOREFRONT OF LIFE HE SAID TO HIMSELF
2919-7270-0035 I MUST GET OVER IT THE BEST I CAN AND BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN THE ROOM WHAT NEXT WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE HE THOUGHT I WILL TRAVEL
2919-7270-0036 FOR NO ONE WOULD BE LIKELY TO CONVERSE WITH HIM ABOUT THE ABOMINABLE CONDUCT OF THAT
2919-7270-0037 HE ARGUED TO HIMSELF THAT DECENT PEOPLE AND HE KNEW NO OTHERS DID NOT CARE TO TALK ABOUT SUCH INDELICATE AFFAIRS SHE HAD GONE OFF WITH THAT UNHEALTHY FAT ASS OF A JOURNALIST WHY
2919-7270-0038 HE HAD BEEN ALL A HUSBAND OUGHT TO BE HE HAD GIVEN HER A GOOD POSITION SHE SHARED HIS PROSPECTS HE HAD TREATED HER INVARIABLY WITH GREAT CONSIDERATION HE REVIEWED HIS CONDUCT WITH A KIND OF DISMAL PRIDE IT HAD BEEN IRREPROACHABLE
2919-7270-0039 AND THE INDELICATE ASPECT OF HIS DOMESTIC MISFORTUNE STRUCK HIM WITH SUCH SHAME THAT NEXT MOMENT
2919-7270-0040 FOR HIM TO INDUCE A GENERAL BELIEF THAT HE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF BEATING HIS WIFE SOME FELLOWS DO
2919-7270-0041 FOR IT WAS CLEAR HE HAD LIVED WITH THE ROOT OF IT FOR FIVE YEARS AND IT WAS TOO SHAMEFUL
2919-7270-0042 BUT HE GAVE IT UP DIRECTLY AND BEGAN TO THINK OF THE DIVORCE COURT IT DID NOT PRESENT ITSELF TO HIM NOTWITHSTANDING HIS RESPECT FOR LAW AND USAGE AS A PROPER REFUGE FOR DIGNIFIED GRIEF
2919-7270-0043 IT APPEARED RATHER AS AN UNCLEAN AND SINISTER CAVERN WHERE MEN AND WOMEN ARE HALED BY ADVERSE FATE
2919-7270-0044 IT SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED THAT WOMAN FIVE YEARS MARRIED FIVE YEARS AND NEVER TO SEE ANYTHING NOT TO THE VERY LAST DAY NOT TILL SHE COOLLY WENT OFF
2919-7270-0045 AND HE PICTURED TO HIMSELF ALL THE PEOPLE HE KNEW ENGAGED IN SPECULATING AS TO WHETHER ALL THAT TIME HE HAD BEEN BLIND FOOLISH OR INFATUATED WHAT A WOMAN BLIND NOT AT ALL
2919-7270-0046 COULD A CLEAN MINDED MAN IMAGINE SUCH DEPRAVITY EVIDENTLY NOT HE DREW A FREE BREATH THAT WAS THE ATTITUDE TO TAKE IT WAS DIGNIFIED ENOUGH IT GAVE HIM THE ADVANTAGE
2919-7270-0047 AND HE COULD NOT HELP PERCEIVING THAT IT WAS MORAL HE YEARNED UNAFFECTEDLY TO SEE MORALITY IN HIS PERSON TRIUMPHANT BEFORE THE WORLD
2919-7270-0048 AS TO HER SHE WOULD BE FORGOTTEN LET HER BE FORGOTTEN BURIED IN OBLIVION LOST NO ONE WOULD ALLUDE REFINED PEOPLE AND EVERY MAN AND WOMAN HE KNEW COULD BE SO DESCRIBED HAD OF COURSE A HORROR OF SUCH TOPICS
2919-7270-0049 HAD THEY OH YES NO ONE WOULD ALLUDE TO HER IN HIS HEARING HE STAMPED HIS FOOT TORE THE LETTER ACROSS THEN AGAIN AND AGAIN THE THOUGHT OF SYMPATHIZING FRIENDS EXCITED IN HIM A FURY OF MISTRUST
2919-7270-0050 HE FLUNG DOWN THE SMALL BITS OF PAPER THEY SETTLED FLUTTERING AT HIS FEET AND LOOKED VERY WHITE ON THE DARK CARPET LIKE A SCATTERED HANDFUL OF SNOW FLAKES
2919-7270-0051 THIS FIT OF HOT ANGER WAS SUCCEEDED BY A SUDDEN SADNESS BY THE DARKENING PASSAGE OF A THOUGHT THAT RAN OVER THE SCORCHED SURFACE OF HIS HEART LIKE UPON A BARREN PLAIN
2919-7270-0052 AND AFTER A FIERCER ASSAULT OF SUNRAYS THE MELANCHOLY AND COOLING SHADOW OF A CLOUD HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD HAD A SHOCK NOT A VIOLENT OR RENDING BLOW THAT CAN BE SEEN
2919-7270-0053 KEEP CHAINED DEEP DOWN IN THE INSCRUTABLE TWILIGHT OF OUR BREASTS A DARK CURTAIN SEEMED TO RISE BEFORE HIM AND FOR LESS THAN A SECOND HE LOOKED UPON THE MYSTERIOUS UNIVERSE OF MORAL SUFFERING
2919-7270-0054 AS A LANDSCAPE IS SEEN COMPLETE AND VAST AND VIVID UNDER A FLASH OF LIGHTNING SO HE COULD SEE DISCLOSED IN A MOMENT ALL THE IMMENSITY OF PAIN THAT CAN BE CONTAINED IN ONE SHORT MOMENT OF HUMAN THOUGHT
2919-7270-0055 THEN THE CURTAIN FELL AGAIN BUT HIS RAPID VISION LEFT IN ALVAN HERVEY'S MIND A TRAIL OF INVINCIBLE SADNESS A SENSE OF LOSS AND BITTER SOLITUDE AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN ROBBED AND EXILED
2919-7270-0056 FOR A MOMENT HE CEASED TO BE A MEMBER OF SOCIETY WITH A POSITION A CAREER AND A NAME ATTACHED TO ALL THIS LIKE A DESCRIPTIVE LABEL OF SOME COMPLICATED COMPOUND HE WAS A SIMPLE HUMAN BEING
2919-7270-0057 AND SQUARES HE STOOD ALONE NAKED AND AFRAID LIKE THE FIRST MAN ON THE FIRST DAY OF EVIL THERE ARE IN LIFE EVENTS CONTACTS GLIMPSES
2919-7270-0058 THAT SEEM BRUTALLY TO BRING ALL THE PAST TO A CLOSE THERE IS A SHOCK AND A CRASH AS OF A GATE FLUNG TO BEHIND ONE BY THE PERFIDIOUS HAND OF FATE GO AND SEEK ANOTHER PARADISE
2919-7270-0059 FOOL OR SAGE THERE IS A MOMENT OF DUMB DISMAY AND THE WANDERINGS MUST BEGIN AGAIN THE PAINFUL EXPLAINING AWAY OF FACTS
2919-7270-0060 THE CHARMING LEGEND OF A HEARTLESS COUNTRY OF A PROMISED LAND ALL FLOWERS AND BLESSINGS HE CAME TO HIMSELF WITH A SLIGHT START
2919-7270-0061 AND WAS MOVED SO DEEPLY BY THE OPPRESSIVE SORROW THAT ANOTHER TURN OF THE SCREW HE FELT WOULD BRING TEARS OUT OF HIS EYES HE WAS DETERIORATING FIVE YEARS OF LIFE IN COMMON HAD APPEASED HIS LONGING YES LONG TIME AGO
2919-7270-0062 THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS DID THAT BUT THERE WAS THE HABIT THE HABIT OF HER PERSON OF HER SMILE OF HER GESTURES OF HER VOICE OF HER SILENCE SHE HAD A PURE BROW AND GOOD HAIR
2919-7270-0063 HE WAS SURPRISED BY THE NUMBER OF DETAILS THAT INTRUDED UPON HIS UNWILLING MEMORY HE COULD NOT HELP REMEMBERING HER FOOTSTEPS THE RUSTLE OF HER DRESS HER WAY OF HOLDING HER HEAD HER DECISIVE MANNER OF SAYING ALVAN
2919-7270-0064 THE QUIVER OF HER NOSTRILS WHEN SHE WAS ANNOYED ALL THAT HAD BEEN SO MUCH HIS PROPERTY SO INTIMATELY AND SPECIALLY HIS HE RAGED IN A MOURNFUL SILENT WAY AS HE TOOK STOCK OF HIS LOSSES
2919-7270-0065 HE WAS LIKE A MAN COUNTING THE COST OF AN UNLUCKY SPECULATION IRRITATED DEPRESSED EXASPERATED WITH HIMSELF AND WITH OTHERS WITH THE FORTUNATE WITH THE INDIFFERENT WITH THE CALLOUS
2919-7270-0066 FOREIGNERS DO THEY ALSO KILL SOMETIMES IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AND TO HIS HORROR HE FELT HIMSELF DRIVEN TO REGRET ALMOST THAT THE USAGES OF A SOCIETY READY TO FORGIVE THE SHOOTING OF A BURGLAR FORBADE HIM
2919-7270-0067 UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES EVEN AS MUCH AS A THOUGHT OF MURDER NEVERTHELESS HE CLENCHED HIS FISTS AND SET HIS TEETH HARD AND HE WAS AFRAID AT THE SAME TIME
2919-7270-0068 IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF A BEAT TO TURN ONE'S HEART INTO A HANDFUL OF DUST THE CONTAMINATION OF HER CRIME SPREAD OUT TAINTED THE UNIVERSE TAINTED HIMSELF WOKE UP ALL THE DORMANT INFAMIES OF THE WORLD
2919-7270-0069 CAUSED A GHASTLY KIND OF CLAIRVOYANCE IN WHICH HE COULD SEE THE TOWNS AND FIELDS OF THE EARTH ITS SACRED PLACES ITS TEMPLES AND ITS HOUSES PEOPLED BY MONSTERS BY MONSTERS OF DUPLICITY LUST AND MURDER SHE WAS A MONSTER
2919-7270-0070 HE HIMSELF WAS THINKING MONSTROUS THOUGHTS AND YET HE WAS LIKE OTHER PEOPLE HOW MANY MEN AND WOMEN AT THIS VERY MOMENT WERE PLUNGED IN ABOMINATIONS MEDITATED CRIMES IT WAS FRIGHTFUL TO THINK OF
2919-7270-0071 EACH SEEMED NOW AN ABODE OF ANGUISH AND FOLLY AND HIS THOUGHT AS IF APPALLED STOOD STILL RECALLING WITH DISMAY THE DECOROUS AND FRIGHTFUL SILENCE THAT WAS LIKE A CONSPIRACY
2919-7270-0072 THE GRIM IMPENETRABLE SILENCE OF MILES OF WALLS CONCEALING PASSIONS MISERY THOUGHTS OF CRIME SURELY HE WAS NOT THE ONLY MAN HIS WAS NOT THE ONLY HOUSE AND YET NO ONE KNEW NO ONE GUESSED
2919-7270-0073 BUT HE KNEW HE KNEW WITH UNERRING CERTITUDE THAT COULD NOT BE DECEIVED BY THE CORRECT SILENCE OF WALLS OF CLOSED DOORS OF CURTAINED WINDOWS
2919-7270-0074 LIKE A MAN INFORMED OF A DEADLY SECRET THE SECRET OF A CALAMITY THREATENING THE SAFETY OF MANKIND THE SACREDNESS
