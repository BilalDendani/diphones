1681-142301-0000 MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM MISTER THORNTON WENT STRAIGHT AND CLEAR INTO ALL THE INTERESTS OF THE FOLLOWING DAY THERE WAS A SLIGHT DEMAND FOR FINISHED GOODS AND AS IT AFFECTED HIS BRANCH OF THE TRADE HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT AND DROVE HARD BARGAINS
1681-142301-0001 HE WAS SHARP TO THE HOUR AT THE MEETING OF HIS BROTHER MAGISTRATES GIVING THEM THE BEST ASSISTANCE OF HIS STRONG SENSE AND HIS POWER OF SEEING CONSEQUENCES AT A GLANCE AND SO COMING TO A RAPID DECISION OLDER MEN MEN OF LONG STANDING IN THE TOWN MEN OF FAR GREATER WEALTH
1681-142301-0002 REALISED AND TURNED INTO LAND WHILE HIS WAS ALL FLOATING CAPITAL ENGAGED IN HIS TRADE LOOKED TO HIM FOR PROMPT READY WISDOM HE WAS THE ONE DEPUTED TO SEE AND ARRANGE WITH THE POLICE TO LEAD IN ALL THE REQUISITE STEPS
1681-142301-0003 AND HE CARED FOR THEIR UNCONSCIOUS DEFERENCE NO MORE THAN FOR THE SOFT WEST WIND THAT SCARCELY MADE THE SMOKE FROM THE GREAT TALL CHIMNEYS SWERVE IN ITS STRAIGHT UPWARD COURSE HE WAS NOT AWARE OF THE SILENT RESPECT PAID TO HIM IF IT HAD BEEN OTHERWISE
1681-142301-0004 HE WOULD HAVE FELT IT AS AN OBSTACLE IN HIS PROGRESS TO THE OBJECT HE HAD IN VIEW AS IT WAS HE LOOKED TO THE SPEEDY ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THAT ALONE IT WAS HIS MOTHER'S GREEDY EARS
1681-142301-0005 THAT SUCKED IN FROM THE WOMEN KIND OF THESE MAGISTRATES AND WEALTHY MEN HOW HIGHLY MISTER THIS OR MISTER THAT THOUGHT OF MISTER THORNTON THAT IF HE HAD NOT BEEN THERE THINGS WOULD HAVE GONE ON VERY DIFFERENTLY VERY BADLY INDEED HE SWEPT OFF HIS BUSINESS RIGHT AND LEFT THAT DAY
1681-142301-0006 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HIS DEEP MORTIFICATION OF YESTERDAY AND THE STUNNED PURPOSELESS COURSE OF THE HOURS AFTERWARDS HAD CLEARED AWAY ALL THE MISTS FROM HIS INTELLECT HE FELT HIS POWER AND REVELLED IN IT HE COULD ALMOST DEFY HIS HEART
1681-142301-0007 IF HE HAD KNOWN IT HE COULD HAVE SANG THE SONG OF THE MILLER WHO LIVED BY THE RIVER DEE I CARE FOR NOBODY NOBODY CARES FOR ME THE EVIDENCE AGAINST BOUCHER AND OTHER RINGLEADERS OF THE RIOT WAS TAKEN BEFORE HIM
1681-142301-0008 THAT AGAINST THE THREE OTHERS FOR CONSPIRACY FAILED BUT HE STERNLY CHARGED THE POLICE TO BE ON THE WATCH FOR THE SWIFT RIGHT ARM OF THE LAW SHOULD BE IN READINESS TO STRIKE AS SOON AS THEY COULD PROVE A FAULT
1681-142301-0009 AND THEN HE LEFT THE HOT REEKING ROOM IN THE BOROUGH COURT AND WENT OUT INTO THE FRESHER BUT STILL SULTRY STREET IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HE GAVE WAY ALL AT ONCE HE WAS SO LANGUID THAT HE COULD NOT CONTROL HIS THOUGHTS
1681-142301-0010 THEY WOULD WANDER TO HER THEY WOULD BRING BACK THE SCENE NOT OF HIS REPULSE AND REJECTION THE DAY BEFORE BUT THE LOOKS THE ACTIONS OF THE DAY BEFORE THAT HE WENT ALONG THE CROWDED STREETS MECHANICALLY
1681-142301-0011 WINDING IN AND OUT AMONG THE PEOPLE BUT NEVER SEEING THEM ALMOST SICK WITH LONGING FOR THAT ONE HALF HOUR THAT ONE BRIEF SPACE OF TIME WHEN SHE CLUNG TO HIM AND HER HEART BEAT AGAINST HIS TO COME ONCE AGAIN
1681-142301-0012 WHY MISTER THORNTON YOU'RE CUTTING ME VERY COOLLY I MUST SAY AND HOW IS MISSUS THORNTON BRAVE WEATHER THIS WE DOCTORS DON'T LIKE IT I CAN TELL YOU I BEG YOUR PARDON DOCTOR DONALDSON I REALLY DIDN'T SEE YOU MY MOTHER'S QUITE WELL THANK YOU

1681-142301-0016 I SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT MISSUS HALE THAT LADY IN CRAMPTON YOU KNOW HASN'T MANY WEEKS TO LIVE I NEVER HAD ANY HOPE OF CURE AS I THINK I TOLD YOU BUT I'VE BEEN SEEING HER TO DAY AND I THINK VERY BADLY OF HER MISTER THORNTON WAS SILENT
1681-142301-0017 THE VAUNTED STEADINESS OF PULSE FAILED HIM FOR AN INSTANT CAN I DO ANYTHING DOCTOR HE ASKED IN AN ALTERED VOICE YOU KNOW YOU WOULD SEE THAT MONEY IS NOT VERY PLENTIFUL ARE THERE ANY COMFORTS OR DAINTIES SHE OUGHT TO HAVE NO
1681-142301-0018 REPLIED THE DOCTOR SHAKING HIS HEAD SHE CRAVES FOR FRUIT SHE HAS A CONSTANT FEVER ON HER BUT JARGONELLE PEARS WILL DO AS WELL AS ANYTHING AND THERE ARE QUANTITIES OF THEM IN THE MARKET YOU WILL TELL ME IF THERE IS ANYTHING I CAN DO I'M SURE REPLIED MISTER THORNTON
1681-142301-0019 I RELY UPON YOU OH NEVER FEAR I'LL NOT SPARE YOUR PURSE I KNOW IT'S DEEP ENOUGH I WISH YOU'D GIVE ME CARTE BLANCHE FOR ALL MY PATIENTS AND ALL THEIR WANTS BUT MISTER THORNTON HAD NO GENERAL BENEVOLENCE NO UNIVERSAL PHILANTHROPY
1681-142301-0020 FEW EVEN WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM CREDIT FOR STRONG AFFECTIONS BUT HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE FIRST FRUIT SHOP IN MILTON AND CHOSE OUT THE BUNCH OF PURPLE GRAPES WITH THE MOST DELICATE BLOOM UPON THEM THE RICHEST COLOURED PEACHES THE FRESHEST VINE LEAVES
1681-142301-0021 THEY WERE PACKED INTO A BASKET AND THE SHOPMAN AWAITED THE ANSWER TO HIS INQUIRY WHERE SHALL WE SEND THEM TO SIR THERE WAS NO REPLY TO MARLBOROUGH MILLS I SUPPOSE SIR NO MISTER THORNTON SAID
1681-142301-0022 GIVE THE BASKET TO ME I'LL TAKE IT IT TOOK UP BOTH HIS HANDS TO CARRY IT AND HE HAD TO PASS THROUGH THE BUSIEST PART OF THE TOWN FOR FEMININE SHOPPING MANY A YOUNG LADY OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE TURNED TO LOOK AFTER HIM
1681-142301-0023 AND THOUGHT IT STRANGE TO SEE HIM OCCUPIED JUST LIKE A PORTER OR AN ERRAND BOY HE WAS THINKING I WILL NOT BE DAUNTED FROM DOING AS I CHOOSE BY THE THOUGHT OF HER I LIKE TO TAKE THIS FRUIT TO THE POOR MOTHER AND IT IS SIMPLY RIGHT THAT I SHOULD
1681-142301-0024 SHE SHALL NEVER SCORN ME OUT OF DOING WHAT I PLEASE A PRETTY JOKE INDEED IF FOR FEAR OF A HAUGHTY GIRL I FAILED IN DOING A KINDNESS TO A MAN I LIKED I DO IT FOR MISTER HALE I DO IT IN DEFIANCE OF HER HE WENT AT AN UNUSUAL PACE AND WAS SOON AT CRAMPTON

1681-142301-0030 AND FANCIED THAT FROM HER BEING ON A LOW SEAT AT FIRST AND NOW STANDING BEHIND HER FATHER HE HAD OVERLOOKED HER IN HIS HASTE AS IF HE DID NOT FEEL THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER PRESENCE ALL OVER THOUGH HIS EYES HAD NEVER RESTED ON HER
