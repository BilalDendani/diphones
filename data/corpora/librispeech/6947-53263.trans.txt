6947-53263-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY TWO AN ADVENTURE IN THE WOOD RALPH ARRAYED HIMSELF FOR DEPARTURE NEXT MORNING WITHOUT MORE WORDS AND WHEN HE WAS READY THE CARLINE SAID TO HIM
6947-53263-0001 WHEN THOU WENTEST FORTH BEFORE I WAS TROUBLED AT THY GOING AND FEARED FOR THY RETURNING BUT NOW I FEAR NOT
6947-53263-0002 THOUGH IT MAY BE LEADING A FAIR WOMAN BY THE HAND SO GO AND ALL LUCK GO WITH THEE RALPH SMILED AT HER WORDS AND WENT HIS WAYS AND CAME INTO THE WOOD THAT LAY DUE SOUTH FROM THE CASTLE AND HE WENT ON AND ON AND HAD NO THOUGHT OF TURNING BACK
6947-53263-0003 HE RESTED TWICE AND STILL WENT ON TILL THE FASHION OF THE THICKETS AND THE WOODS CHANGED ABOUT HIM AND AT LAST WHEN THE SUN WAS GETTING LOW HE SAW LIGHT GLEAMING THROUGH A GREAT WOOD OF PINES WHICH HAD LONG BEEN DARK BEFORE HIM AGAINST THE TALL BOLES
6947-53263-0004 HE CAME OUT OF THE PINEWOOD ON TO THE GRASS BUT THERE WERE THORNBUSHES A FEW ABOUT SO THAT MOVING WARILY FROM ONE TO THE OTHER HE MIGHT PERCHANCE SEE WITHOUT BEING SEEN WARILY HE WENT FORSOOTH GOING ALONG THE GREEN STRAND TO THE EAST AND THE HEAD OF THAT WATER
6947-53263-0005 AND SAW HOW THE BANK SLOPED UP GENTLY FROM ITS ENDING TOWARD THE PINE WOOD IN FRONT OF WHOSE CLOSE SET TREES STOOD THREE GREAT BOLED TALL OAK TREES ON A SMOOTH PIECE OF GREEN SWARD AND NOW HE SAW THAT THERE WERE FOLK COME BEFORE HIM ON THIS GREEN PLACE
6947-53263-0006 AND KEEN SIGHTED AS HE WAS COULD MAKE OUT THAT THREE MEN WERE ON THE HITHER SIDE OF THE OAK TREES AND ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF THEM WAS A WHITE HORSE THITHERWARD THEN HE MADE STEALING FROM BUSH TO BUSH SINCE HE DEEMED THAT HE NEEDED NOT BE SEEN OF MEN WHO MIGHT BE FOES
6947-53263-0007 BEFORE HE SAW THE WESTERING SUN SHINE BRIGHTLY FROM A NAKED SWORD AND THEN ANOTHER SPRANG UP TO MEET IT AND HE HEARD FAINTLY THE CLASH OF STEEL
6947-53263-0008 AND WAS A WOMAN BELIKE THEN HE BETTERED HIS PACE AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO CAME SO NEAR THAT HE COULD SEE THE MEN CLEARLY THAT THEY WERE CLAD IN KNIGHTLY WAR GEAR AND WERE LAYING ON GREAT STROKES SO THAT THE STILL PLACE RANG WITH THE CLATTER AS FOR THE WOMAN
6947-53263-0009 HE COULD SEE BUT LITTLE OF HER BECAUSE OF THE FIGHTING MEN BEFORE HER AND THE SHADOW OF THE OAK BOUGHS FELL ON HER WITHAL NOW AS HE WENT HIDDEN BY THE BUSHES THEY HID THE MEN ALSO FROM HIM AND WHEN HE WAS COME TO THE LAST BUSH SOME FIFTY PACES FROM THEM
6947-53263-0010 RUSHED ON HIS FOE AND SMOTE SO FIERCELY THAT HE FELL TO THE EARTH BEFORE HIM AND THE BIG MAN FELL UPON HIM AS HE FELL AND LET KNEE AND SWORD POMMEL AND FIST FOLLOW THE STROKE AND THERE THEY WALLOWED ON THE EARTH TOGETHER STRAIGHTWAY
6947-53263-0011 RALPH CAME FORTH FROM THE BUSHES WITH HIS DRAWN SWORD IN HIS HAND AND EVEN THEREWITH WHAT WITH THE TWO KNIGHTS BEING BOTH LOW UPON THE EARTH WHAT WITH THE WOMAN HERSELF COMING FROM OUT THE SHADOW OF THE OAK BOUGHS AND TURNING HER TOWARD RALPH HE SAW HER CLEARLY
6947-53263-0012 YET DID HE SEEM TO SEE HER BODY THROUGH THAT WHICH COVERED IT BUT NOW HER ATTIRE WAS BUT SIMPLE A GREEN GOWN THIN AND SHORT AND THEREOVER A COTE HARDY OF BLACK CLOTH WITH ORPHREYS OF GOLD AND COLOURS BUT ON HER NECK WAS A COLLAR THAT SEEMED TO HIM
6947-53263-0013 THUS THEY ABODE FOR ABOUT THE SPACE OF ONE MINUTE AND MEANWHILE THE BIG MAN ROSE UP ON ONE KNEE AND STEADIED HIM WITH HIS SWORD FOR A MOMENT OF TIME AND THE BLADE WAS BLOODY FROM THE POINT HALF WAY UP TO THE HILT
6947-53263-0014 SCOWLING AND HIS FACE WHITE AS CHALK THEN HE SPAKE TO HER COLDLY AND STERNLY STRETCHING OUT HIS BLOODY SWORD BEFORE HER I HAVE DONE THY BIDDING AND SLAIN MY VERY EARTHLY FRIEND OF FRIENDS FOR THY SAKE
