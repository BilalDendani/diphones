753-150477-0000 AND THE DEAR PEOPLE DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT TO DO WITH IT
753-150477-0001 ROUND WHICH THE MILITIA OF THE COUNTRY WILL RALLY AND FROM WHICH THEY WILL GET A STIFFENING IN TIME OF DANGER YET OTHER PEOPLE CONSIDER THAT THE ARMY SHOULD BE BUILT LIKE A PAIR OF LAZY TONGS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF ELASTICITY AND EXTENSION
753-150477-0002 SO THAT IN TIME OF NEED IT MAY FILL UP ITS SKELETON BATTALIONS AND EMPTY SADDLE TROOPS THIS IS REAL WISDOM BE CAUSE THE AMERICAN ARMY AS AT PRESENT CONSTITUTED IS MADE UP OF TWENTY FIVE REGIMENTS INFANTRY TEN COMPANIES EACH
753-150477-0003 TEN REGIMENTS CAVALRY TWELVE COMPANIES EACH FIVE REGIMENTS ARTILLERY TWELVE COMPANIES EACH NOW THERE IS A NOTION IN THE AIR TO REORGANIZE THE SERVICE ON THESE LINES EIGHTEEN REGIMENTS INFANTRY AT FOUR BATTALIONS FOUR COMPANIES EACH
753-150477-0004 THIRD BATTALION SKELETON FOURTH ON PAPER EIGHT REGIMENTS CAVALRY AT FOUR BATTALIONS FOUR TROOPS EACH THIRD BATTALION SKELETON FOURTH ON PAPER FIVE REGIMENTS ARTILLERY AT FOUR BATTALIONS FOUR COMPANIES EACH THIRD BATTALION SKELETON FOURTH ON PAPER
753-150477-0005 OBSERVE THE BEAUTY OF THIS BUSINESS THE THIRD BATTALION WILL HAVE ITS OFFICERS BUT NO MEN THE FOURTH WILL PROBABLY HAVE A RENDEZVOUS AND SOME EQUIPMENT IT IS NOT CONTEMPLATED TO GIVE IT ANYTHING MORE DEFINITE AT PRESENT
753-150477-0006 WE GET AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND MEN WHICH
753-150477-0007 TO THE HUGE DELIGHT OF THE OFFICERS THE MILITARY NEEDS OF THE STATES BE THREE A FRONTIER WARFARE
753-150477-0008 AND IN THE NATURE OF THINGS GROWING LESS ARDUOUS YEAR BY YEAR B INTERNAL RIOTS AND COMMOTIONS WHICH RISE UP LIKE A DUST DEVIL WHIRL FURIOUSLY AND DIE OUT LONG BEFORE THE AUTHORITIES AT WASHINGTON COULD BEGIN TO FILL UP EVEN THE THIRD SKELETON BATTALIONS
753-150477-0009 MUCH LESS HUNT ABOUT FOR MATERIAL FOR THE FOURTH
753-150477-0010 IN WHICH AS THE CASE IN THE AFFAIR OF THE NORTH AND SOUTH THE REGULAR ARMY WOULD BE SWAMPED IN THE MASS OF MILITIA AND ARMED VOLUNTEERS WOULD TURN THE LAND INTO A HELL YET THE AUTHORITIES PERSIST IN REGARDING AN EXTERNAL WAR
753-150477-0011 WOULD BE CAPABLE OF HEAVING A SHOVELFUL OF MUD INTO THE ATLANTIC IN THE HOPE OF FILLING IT UP CONSEQUENTLY THE AUTHORITIES ARE FASCINATED WITH THE IDEA OF THE SLIDING SCALE OR CONCERTINA ARMY THIS IS AN HEREDITARY INSTINCT FOR YOU KNOW THAT WHEN WE ENGLISH HAVE GOT TOGETHER TWO COMPANIES ONE MACHINE GUN A SICK BULLOCK
753-150477-0012 FORTY GENERALS AND A MASS OF W O FORMS WE SAY WE POSSESS AN ARMY CORPS CAPABLE OF INDEFINITE EXTENSION THE AMERICAN ARMY IS A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE ARMY SOME DAY WHEN ALL THE INDIANS ARE HAPPILY DEAD OR DRUNK
753-150477-0013 IT OUGHT TO MAKE THE FINEST SCIENTIFIC AND SURVEY CORPS THAT THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN IT DOES EXCELLENT WORK NOW BUT THERE IS THIS DEFECT IN ITS NATURE IT IS OFFICERED AS YOU KNOW FROM WEST POINT THE MISCHIEF OF IT IS
753-150477-0014 A BOY GOES UP TO THAT INSTITUTION GETS HIS PASS AND RETURNS TO CIVIL LIFE SO THEY TELL ME WITH A DANGEROUS KNOWLEDGE THAT HE IS A SUCKLING VON MOLTKE AND MAY APPLY HIS LEARNING WHEN OCCASION OFFERS GIVEN TROUBLE THAT MAN WILL BE A NUISANCE
753-150477-0015 BECAUSE HE IS A HIDEOUSLY VERSATILE AMERICAN TO BEGIN WITH
753-150477-0016 AND WITH ALL THE RACIAL DISREGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE TO BACK HIM THROUGH ANY DEMI SEMI PROFESSIONAL GENERALSHIP
753-150477-0017 MEN ENGAGED IN A CONFLICT WITH POLICE OR JAILS
753-150477-0018 AND GET HEAVILY SHOT IN A SORT OF CHEAP HALF CONSTRUCTED WARFARE INSTEAD OF BEING DECENTLY SCARED BY THE APPEARANCE OF THE MILITARY THIS SORT OF ARRANGEMENT DOES NOT SEEM WISE
753-150477-0019 THE BOND BETWEEN THE STATES IS OF AN AMAZING TENUITY SO LONG AS THEY DO NOT ABSOLUTELY MARCH INTO THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SIT ON THE WASHINGTON STATUES AND INVENT A FLAG OF THEIR OWN
753-150477-0020 THEY CAN LEGISLATE LYNCH HUNT NEGROES THROUGH SWAMPS DIVORCE RAILROAD AND RAMPAGE AS MUCH AS EVER THEY CHOOSE THEY DO NOT NEED KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR OWN MILITARY STRENGTH TO BACK THEIR GENIAL LAWLESSNESS THAT REGULAR ARMY
753-150477-0021 WHICH IS A DEAR LITTLE ARMY SHOULD BE KEPT TO ITSELF BLOODED ON DETACHMENT DUTY TURNED INTO THE PATHS OF SCIENCE AND NOW AND AGAIN ASSEMBLED AT FEASTS OF FREE MASONS AND SO FORTH IT IS TOO TINY TO BE A POLITICAL POWER
753-150477-0022 THE IMMORTAL WRECK OF THE GRAND ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC IS A POLITICAL POWER OF THE LARGEST AND MOST UNBLUSHING DESCRIPTION IT OUGHT NOT TO HELP TO LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF AN AMATEUR MILITARY POWER THAT IS BLIND AND IRRESPONSIBLE
753-150477-0023 BY GREAT GOOD LUCK THE EVIL MINDED TRAIN ALREADY DELAYED TWELVE HOURS BY A BURNED BRIDGE BROUGHT ME TO THE CITY ON A SATURDAY
753-150477-0024 BY WAY OF THAT VALLEY WHICH THE MORMONS OVER THEIR EFFORTS HAD CAUSED TO BLOSSOM LIKE THE ROSE TWELVE HOURS PREVIOUSLY I HAD ENTERED INTO A NEW WORLD WHERE IN CONVERSATION EVERY ONE WAS EITHER A MORMON OR A GENTILE
753-150477-0025 IT IS NOT SEEMLY FOR A FREE AND INDEPENDENT CITIZEN TO DUB HIMSELF A GENTILE BUT THE MAYOR OF OGDEN WHICH IS THE GENTILE CITY OF THE VALLEY TOLD ME THAT THERE MUST BE SOME DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TWO FLOCKS LONG BEFORE THE FRUIT ORCHARDS OF LOGAN
753-150477-0026 OR THE SHINING LEVELS OF THE SALT LAKE HAD BEEN REACHED THAT MAYOR HIMSELF A GENTILE AND ONE RENOWNED FOR HIS DEALINGS WITH THE MORMONS TOLD ME THAT THE GREAT QUESTION OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE POWER WITHIN THE POWER
753-150477-0027 WAS BEING GRADUALLY SOLVED BY THE BALLOT AND BY EDUCATION ALL THE BEAUTY OF THE VALLEY COULD NOT MAKE ME FORGET IT AND THE VALLEY IS VERY FAIR BENCH AFTER BENCH OF LAND
753-150477-0028 FLAT AS A TABLE AGAINST THE FLANKS OF THE RINGING HILLS MARKS WHERE THE SALT LAKE RESTED FOR AWHILE IN ITS COLLAPSE
753-150477-0029 THERE ARE THE MAKINGS OF A VERY FINE CREED ABOUT MORMONISM TO BEGIN WITH THE CHURCH IS RATHER MORE ABSOLUTE THAN THAT OF ROME DROP THE POLYGAMY PLANK IN THE PLATFORM
753-150477-0030 BUT ON THE OTHER HAND DEAL LIGHTLY WITH CERTAIN FORMS OF EXCESS KEEP THE QUALITY OF THE RECRUIT DOWN TO THE LOW MENTAL LEVEL AND SEE THAT THE BEST OF ALL THE AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AVAILABLE IS IN THE HANDS OF THE ELDERS AND THERE
753-150477-0031 YOU HAVE A FIRST CLASS ENGINE FOR PIONEER WORK THE TAWDRY MYSTICISM AND THE BORROWING FROM FREEMASONRY SERVE THE LOW CASTE SWEDE AND DANE THE WELSHMAN AND THE CORNISH COTTER JUST AS WELL AS A HIGHLY ORGANIZED HEAVEN
753-150477-0032 THEN I WENT ABOUT THE STREETS AND PEEPED INTO PEOPLE'S FRONT WINDOWS AND THE DECORATIONS UPON THE TABLES WERE AFTER THE MANNER OF THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FIFTY MAIN STREET WAS FULL OF COUNTRY FOLK FROM THE DESERT
753-150477-0033 COME IN TO TRADE WITH THE ZION MERCANTILE CO OPERATIVE INSTITUTE THE CHURCH I FANCY LOOKS AFTER THE FINANCES OF THIS THING AND IT CONSEQUENTLY PAYS GOOD DIVIDENDS THE FACES OF THE WOMEN WERE NOT LOVELY IN DEED
753-150477-0034 BUT FOR THE CERTAINTY THAT UGLY PERSONS ARE JUST AS IRRATIONAL IN THE MATTER OF UNDIVIDED LOVE AS THE BEAUTIFUL IT SEEMS THAT POLYGAMY WAS A BLESSED INSTITUTION FOR THE WOMEN AND THAT ONLY THE DREAD THREATS OF THE SPIRITUAL POWER
753-150477-0035 COULD DRIVE THE HULKING BOARD FACED MEN INTO IT THE WOMEN WORE HIDEOUS GARMENTS AND THE MEN APPEARED TO BE TIED UP WITH STRINGS
753-150477-0036 AND ON SUNDAY GO TO THE PRAYING PLACE I TRIED TO TALK TO A FEW OF THEM BUT THEY SPOKE STRANGE TONGUES AND STARED AND BEHAVED LIKE COWS YET ONE WOMAN AND NOT AN ALTOGETHER UGLY ONE
753-150477-0037 CONFIDED TO ME THAT SHE HATED THE IDEA OF SALT LAKE CITY BEING TURNED INTO A SHOW PLACE FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THE GENTILES
753-150477-0038 THE DROPPED H BETRAYED HER AND WHEN DID YOU LEAVE ENGLAND I SAID SUMMER OF EIGHTY FOUR
753-150477-0039 AND WE WAS VERY POOR NOW WE'RE BETTER OFF MY FATHER AN MOTHER AN ME THEN YOU LIKE THE STATE SHE MISUNDERSTOOD AT FIRST OH I AIN'T LIVIN IN THE STATE OF POLYGAMY NOT ME YET I AIN'T MARRIED I LIKE WHERE I AM
753-150477-0040 I'VE GOT THINGS O MY OWN AND SOME LAND BUT I SUPPOSE YOU WILL NOT ME
753-150477-0041 IT'S THE ELDERS BUSINESS AN BETWEEN YOU AN ME I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING ON MUCH LONGER
753-150477-0042 THE SWEDES THEY THINK IT HIS I KNOW IT HISN'T BUT YOU'VE GOT YOUR LAND ALL RIGHT OH YES WE'VE GOT OUR LAND AN WE NEVER SAY AUGHT AGAINST POLYGAMY O COURSE
753-150477-0043 ON A TABLE LAND OVERLOOKING ALL THE CITY
753-150477-0044 THE STATE OF UTAH CAN DO NEARLY ANYTHING IT PLEASES UNTIL THAT MUCH TO BE DESIRED HOUR WHEN THE GENTILE VOTE SHALL QUIETLY SWAMP OUT MORMONISM BUT THE GARRISON IS KEPT THERE IN CASE OF ACCIDENTS THE BIG
753-150477-0045 SHARK MOUTHED PIG EARED HEAVY BONED FARMERS SOMETIMES TAKE TO THEIR CREED WITH WILDEST FANATICISM AND IN PAST YEARS HAVE MADE LIFE EXCESSIVELY UNPLEASANT FOR THE GENTILE WHEN HE WAS FEW IN THE LAND
753-150477-0046 BUT TO DAY SO FAR FROM KILLING OPENLY OR SECRETLY OR BURNING GENTILE FARMS IT IS ALL THE MORMON DARE DO TO FEEBLY TRY TO BOYCOTT THE INTERLOPER
753-150477-0047 AND IN THE TABERNACLE ON A SUNDAY THE PREACHERS FOLLOW SUIT WHEN I WENT THERE
753-150477-0048 A MAN ROSE UP AND TOLD THEM THAT THEY WERE THE CHOSEN OF GOD THE ELECT OF ISRAEL THAT THEY WERE TO OBEY THEIR PRIESTS AND THAT THERE WAS A GOOD TIME COMING I FANCY THAT THEY HAD
753-150477-0049 HEARD ALL THIS BEFORE SO MANY TIMES IT PRODUCED NO IMPRESSION WHATEVER EVEN AS THE SUBLIMEST MYSTERIES OF ANOTHER FAITH LOSE SALT THROUGH CONSTANT ITERATION
