6652-70975-0034 BUY RIBBONS FOR HER THEN WITH THE CROWN I GIVE YOU ROBIN EXPRESSED HIS THANKS VERY CORDIALLY THIS FELLOW SEEMED AN HONEST HEARTED ROGUE
6652-70975-0035 AS IT WAS ALL THE JOUSTING WAS DONE AND MOST OF THE NOBLES HAD ALREADY GONE AWAY THE SHERIFF WAS FUSSILY PREPARING HIMSELF TO ESCORT THE PRINCE TO THE CASTLE WHEN THE HORNS BLEW ANNOUNCING THE ARRIVAL OF THE LINCOLNSHIRE BOWMEN THEY HAD PUSHED THEIR WAY CLUMSILY THROUGH THE ARRAY OF TENTS AND NOW
6652-70975-0036 BLUNDERED INTO THE LISTS THROUGH THE GATE ROBIN WAS GLAD INDEED OF HIS STAINED FACE AND SEMI DISGUISE NOT BEING OVER PROUD OF HIS COMPANIONS HE GAVE WILL STUTELEY A SIGNAL TO DETACH HIMSELF FROM THEM AND COME TO HIS SIDE THE TWO YOUTHS THEN HASTENED TO THE ARCHERS STAND
6652-70975-0037 SIX OTHERS WERE SERIOUSLY INJURED YET THE PRINCE LOOKED FAR FROM BEING SATISFIED AND HIS GLANCE STRAYED FOR EVER TO THE GATE WHEN THE LINCOLN MEN HAD COME NOISILY TROOPING IN HIS FACE HAD LIT UP AND HIS HAND HAD MADE A HALF MOVEMENT TO FIND THE JEWELLED HILT OF HIS SWORD
6652-70975-0038 MASTER CARFAX TOO HAD STARTED TO HIS FEET IN EVIDENT CONCERN WHEN THE HERALDS ANNOUNCED THESE NEW COMERS
6652-70975-0039 CLEARLY THEY WERE EAGERLY EXPECTING THE APPEARANCE OF OTHER FOLK BUT QUICKLY RECOVERING HIMSELF JOHN RE FOUND ALL THE OLD ELEGANCE OF HIS MANNERS
6652-70975-0040 IN HIS BOX MASTER MONCEUX GAVE THE SIGNAL FOR THE ARCHERY CONTEST TO BE BEGUN AND ROBIN SOON SAW THAT THE ARCHERS AGAINST HIM WERE MEN VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WHO HAD BEEN AT NOTTINGHAM FAIR
6652-70975-0041 WHEN IT CAME TO THE TURN OF THE PRINCE'S OWN BOWMAN HUBERT OF NORMANDY A MAN SLIM CONCEITED AND OVER DRESSED BUT NEVERTHELESS A VERY SPLENDID ARCHER THE FIRST SHAFT FLEW SO CLEANLY AND SO SWIFT
6652-70975-0042 THAT IT PIERCED THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE TARGET AND STUCK OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE FULL HALF ITS LENGTH ROBIN HAD TO SHOOT IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIM AND WAITED A FEW MOMENTS WHILST THE MARKERS WERE TUGGING AT THE NORMAN'S ARROW A SUDDEN INSPIRATION FLASHED ACROSS THE LAD'S MIND
6652-70975-0043 AND ADVANCING A STEP HE BADE THEM DESIST THEY WONDERINGLY FELL BACK LEAVING HUBERT'S ARROW FIXED SPITEFULLY IN THE TARGET
6652-70975-0044 BUT EVEN AS HE SPOKE ROBIN'S ARROW FLEW HISSING FROM HIS BOW A SILENCE FELL UPON THE ONLOOKERS AND EVEN THE SMILING PRINCE LEANED FORWARD IN HIS BOX THEN A GREAT SHOUT WENT UP OF AMAZEMENT AND INCREDULITY THE MARKERS AND HERALDS THRONGED ABOUT THE TARGET
6652-70975-0045 AND HID IT FROM THE GENERAL VIEW UNTIL THEY WERE IMPATIENTLY PULLED AWAY BY SOME OF THE PRINCE'S BODYGUARD A MARVEL WAS SEEN THEN BY ALL EYES ROBIN'S ARROW STANDING STIFFLY OUT FROM THE CENTER OF THE TARGET WITH HUBERT'S WAND
6652-70975-0046 SPLIT DOWN ON EITHER SIDE OF IT FLUSH TO THE VERY FACE OF THE MARK ROBIN HIMSELF COULD SCARCELY CREDIT HIS OWN SUCCESS
6652-70975-0047 TWAS A FEAT WORTHY OF HUBERT HIMSELF SAID THE SHERIFF BOMBASTICALLY TO THE PRINCE HE HAD NOT RECOGNIZED ROBIN I HAVE SEEN HUBERT PERFORM JUST SUCH A TRICK ON MANY OCCASIONS SIR SAID CARFAX THIS FELLOW HAS DONE NO UNCOMMON THING BELIEVE ME HE WENT ON
6652-70975-0048 THAT IS TRUE SAID THE PRINCE AS IF THOUGHTFULLY HIS FACE SHOWED SMILING AGAIN LET THE CONTEST GO ON AND HUBERT SHALL SHOOT AGAIN WITH THIS YOUNG TRICKSTER
6652-70975-0049 SAID ONE OF THE COURTIERS IF THAT IS SO HIS SHOOTING IS OF NO AVAIL BE IT NEVER SO GOOD CRIED CARFAX TRIUMPHANTLY TELL THEM THAT THE ARCHER IS DISQUALIFIED MY LORD HE CONTINUED ADDRESSING THE SHERIFF AND BID THEM DISCOVER WHO HE MAY BE
6652-70975-0050 CARFAX TURNED AGAIN TO THE PRINCE AND BEGAN A WHISPERED CONVERSATION WITH HIM THE PRINCE LISTENED NODDING HIS HEAD IN APPROVAL WELL MONCEUX WHAT DO THEY SAY HE ASKED THE SHERIFF LANGUIDLY AS THE OTHER RETURNED
6652-70975-0051 IT SEEMS SIRE THAT THE ARCHER IS ONE WHO CAME IN WITH A COMPANY OF LINCOLN BOWMEN NO ONE KNOWS HIM HEREABOUT I HAVE SAID THAT HE IS DISQUALIFIED AND NOW THE OTHERS WILL SHOOT AGAIN
6652-70975-0052 IN SOOTH I DO THINK SO ANSWERED THE PRINCE LAUGHING RATHER CONCEITEDLY BUT MONCEUX BID THIS LAD TO ME FORTHWITH I WOULD SPEAK WITH HIM THE SHERIFF WENT ABOUT THE TASK BUT ROBIN HAD DISAPPEARED
6652-70975-0053 FOR SUDDENLY AMIDST THE THRONG HIS EYES HAD ENCOUNTERED THOSE STRANGE GREY BLUE ONES OF MISTRESS FITZWALTER
6652-70975-0054 ROBIN HAD WALKED DOWN THE LISTS TO SEE FOR HIMSELF THAT HIS SHAFT HAD SPLIT THE NORMAN'S FAIRLY AND IN TURNING AWAY TO FIND STUTELEY
6652-70975-0055 PIERCING GAZE SHE ALLOWED HER EYES TO REST FULLY ON YOUNG FITZOOTH'S ARDENT GLANCE FOR THE BRIEFEST MOMENT THEN SHE LOOKED AWAY UNCONCERNEDLY
