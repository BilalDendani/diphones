7126-59167-0000 MISTER EDWARD GARNETT HAS RECENTLY COLLECTED HIS PREFACES TO THE NOVELS AND STORIES OF TURGENEV AND REFASHIONED THEM INTO A BOOK IN PRAISE OF THE GENIUS OF THE MOST CHARMING OF RUSSIAN AUTHORS I AM AFRAID THE WORD CHARMING HAS LOST SO MUCH OF ITS STAMP AND BRIGHTNESS WITH USE
7126-59167-0001 BUT WE APPLY IT TO TURGENEV IN ITS FULLEST SENSE WE CALL HIM CHARMING AS PATER CALLED ATHENS CHARMING HE IS ONE OF THOSE AUTHORS WHOSE BOOKS WE LOVE BECAUSE THEY REVEAL A PERSONALITY SENSITIVE AFFECTIONATE PITIFUL
7126-59167-0002 THERE ARE SOME PERSONS WHO WHEN THEY COME INTO A ROOM IMMEDIATELY MAKE US FEEL HAPPIER TURGENEV SEEMS TO COME INTO THE ROOM IN HIS BOOKS WITH JUST SUCH A WELCOME PRESENCE THAT IS WHY I WISH MISTER GARNETT HAD MADE HIS BOOK A BIOGRAPHICAL AS WELL AS A CRITICAL STUDY
7126-59167-0003 HE QUOTES TURGENEV AS SAYING ALL MY LIFE IS IN MY BOOKS STILL THERE ARE A GREAT MANY FACTS RECORDED ABOUT HIM IN THE LETTERS AND REMINISCENCES OF THOSE WHO KNEW HIM AND HE WAS KNOWN IN HALF THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE OUT OF WHICH WE CAN CONSTRUCT A PORTRAIT
7126-59167-0004 ONE FINDS IN THE LIFE OF SIR CHARLES DILKE FOR INSTANCE THAT DILKE CONSIDERED TURGENEV IN THE FRONT RANK AS A CONVERSATIONALIST THIS OPINION INTERESTED ONE ALL THE MORE BECAUSE ONE HAD COME TO THINK OF TURGENEV AS SOMETHING OF A SHY GIANT
7126-59167-0005 I REMEMBER TOO READING IN SOME FRENCH BOOK A DESCRIPTION OF TURGENEV AS A STRANGE FIGURE IN THE LITERARY CIRCLES OF PARIS A LARGE FIGURE WITH A CURIOUS CHASTITY OF MIND WHO SEEMED BEWILDERED BY SOME OF THE BARBAROUS JESTS OF CIVILIZED MEN OF GENIUS
7126-59167-0006 THERE ARE INDEED AS I HAVE SAID PLENTY OF SUGGESTIONS FOR A PORTRAIT OF TURGENEV QUITE APART FROM HIS NOVELS MISTER GARNETT REFERS TO SOME OF THEM IN TWO EXCELLENT BIOGRAPHICAL CHAPTERS
7126-59167-0007 TO HIS CONTEMPORARIES AND RIVALS AS WHEN HE INTRODUCED THE WORK OF TOLSTOY TO A FRENCH EDITOR LISTEN
7126-59167-0008 HERE IS COPY FOR YOUR PAPER OF AN ABSOLUTELY FIRST RATE KIND
7126-59167-0009 THE MASTER FOR HE IS A REAL MASTER IS ALMOST UNKNOWN IN FRANCE BUT I ASSURE YOU ON MY SOUL AND CONSCIENCE THAT I DO NOT CONSIDER MYSELF WORTHY TO UNLOOSE THE LATCHET OF HIS SHOES THE LETTER HE ADDRESSED TO TOLSTOY FROM HIS DEATH BED
7126-59167-0010 URGING HIM TO RETURN FROM PROPAGANDA TO LITERATURE IS FAMOUS BUT IT IS A THING TO WHICH ONE ALWAYS RETURNS FONDLY AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE NOBLE DISINTERESTEDNESS OF A GREAT MAN OF LETTERS I CANNOT RECOVER TURGENEV WROTE
7126-59167-0011 THAT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION I AM WRITING TO YOU SPECIALLY TO SAY HOW GLAD I AM TO BE YOUR CONTEMPORARY AND TO EXPRESS MY LAST AND SINCERE REQUEST MY FRIEND RETURN TO LITERARY ACTIVITY THAT GIFT CAME TO YOU WHENCE COMES ALL THE REST
7126-59167-0012 AH HOW HAPPY I SHOULD BE IF I COULD THINK MY REQUEST WOULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON YOU
7126-59167-0013 IT IS WEARISOME EVEN TO REPEAT IT ALL MY FRIEND GREAT WRITER OF OUR RUSSIAN LAND LISTEN TO MY REQUEST I CAN WRITE NO MORE I AM TIRED ONE SOMETIMES WONDERS HOW TOLSTOY AND DOSTOEVSKY COULD EVER HAVE QUARRELLED WITH A FRIEND
7126-59167-0014 OF SO BEAUTIFUL A CHARACTER AS TURGENEV
7126-59167-0015 THEY WERE BOTH MEN OF ACTION IN LITERATURE MILITANT AND BY NATURE PROPAGANDIST AND PROBABLY TURGENEV WAS AS IMPATIENT WITH THE FAULTS OF THEIR STRENGTH AS THEY WERE WITH THE FAULTS OF HIS WEAKNESS HE WAS A MAN WHOM IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DISGUST
7126-59167-0016 THOUGH HE WAS ZOLA'S FRIEND HE COMPLAINED THAT L'ASSOMMOIR LEFT A BAD TASTE IN THE MOUTH SIMILARLY HE DISCOVERED SOMETHING ALMOST SADISTIC IN THE MANNER IN WHICH DOSTOEVSKY LET HIS IMAGINATION DWELL ON SCENES OF CRUELTY AND HORROR
7126-59167-0017 AND HE WAS AS STRONGLY REPELLED BY DOSTOEVSKY'S SHRIEKING PAN SLAVISM AS BY HIS SENSATIONALISM AMONG HORRORS ONE CAN GUESS EXACTLY THE FRAME OF MIND HE WAS IN WHEN IN THE COURSE OF AN ARGUMENT WITH DOSTOEVSKY HE SAID YOU SEE I CONSIDER MYSELF A GERMAN
7126-59167-0018 THIS HAS BEEN QUOTED AGAINST TURGENEV AS THOUGH HE MEANT IT LITERALLY AND AS THOUGH IT WERE A CONFESSION OF DENATIONALIZATION HIS WORDS WERE MORE SUBTLE THAN THAT IN THEIR IRONY WHAT THEY MEANT WAS SIMPLY IF TO BE A RUSSIAN IS TO BE A BIGOT
7126-59167-0019 LIKE MOST OF YOU PAN SLAV ENTHUSIASTS THEN I AM NO RUSSIAN BUT A EUROPEAN HAS HE NOT PUT THE WHOLE GOSPEL OF NATIONALISM IN HALF A DOZEN SENTENCES IN RUDIN HE REFUSED HOWEVER TO ADOPT ALONG WITH HIS NATIONALISM THE NARROWNESS WITH WHICH IT HAS BEEN TOO OFTEN ASSOCIATED
7126-59167-0020 HE HAD THAT SENSE OF TRUTH WHICH ALWAYS UPSETS THE ORTHODOX THIS SENSE OF TRUTH APPLIED TO THE PORTRAITURE OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES WAS FELT LIKE AN INSULT IN THOSE CIRCLES OF MIXED IDEALISM AND MAKE BELIEVE THE CIRCLES OF THE POLITICAL PARTISANS A GREAT ARTIST MAY BE A MEMBER
7126-59167-0021 OF A POLITICAL PARTY BUT IN HIS ART HE CANNOT BECOME A POLITICAL PARTISAN WITHOUT CEASING TO BE AN ARTIST IN HIS NOVELS TURGENEV REGARDED IT AS HIS LIFE WORK TO PORTRAY RUSSIA TRUTHFULLY NOT TO PAINT AND POWDER
7126-59167-0022 AND PRETTIFY IT FOR SHOW PURPOSES AND THE RESULT WAS AN OUTBURST OF FURY ON THE PART OF THOSE WHO WERE ASKED TO LOOK AT THEMSELVES AS REAL PEOPLE
7126-59167-0023 WHEN FATHERS AND CHILDREN WAS PUBLISHED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
7126-59167-0024 I RECEIVED CONGRATULATIONS HE WROTE ALMOST CARESSES FROM PEOPLE OF THE OPPOSITE CAMP FROM ENEMIES THIS CONFUSED ME WOUNDED ME BUT MY CONSCIENCE DID NOT REPROACH ME
7126-59167-0025 I KNEW VERY WELL I HAD CARRIED OUT HONESTLY THE TYPE I HAD SKETCHED CARRIED IT OUT NOT ONLY WITHOUT PREJUDICE BUT POSITIVELY WITH SYMPATHY THIS IS BOUND TO BE THE FATE OF EVERY ARTIST WHO TAKES HIS POLITICAL PARTY OR HIS CHURCH
7126-59167-0026 OR ANY OTHER PROPAGANDIST GROUP TO WHICH HE BELONGS AS HIS SUBJECT HE IS A PAINTER NOT A VINDICATOR AND HE IS COMPELLED TO EXHIBIT NUMEROUS CROOKED FEATURES AND FAULTS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO WOUND THE VANITY OF HIS FRIENDS AND DELIGHT THE MALICE OF HIS ENEMIES
7126-59167-0027 ARTISTIC TRUTH IS AS DIFFERENT FROM PROPAGANDIST TRUTH AS DAYLIGHT FROM LIMELIGHT AND THE ARTIST WILL ALWAYS BE HATED BY THE PROPAGANDIST AS WORSE THAN AN ENEMY A TREACHEROUS FRIEND TURGENEV DELIBERATELY ACCEPTED AS HIS LIFE WORK
7126-59167-0028 A COURSE WHICH COULD ONLY LEAD TO THE MISERIES OF BEING MISUNDERSTOOD WHEN ONE THINKS OF THE LONG YEARS OF DENUNCIATION AND HATRED HE ENDURED FOR THE SAKE OF HIS ART ONE CANNOT BUT REGARD HIM AS ONE OF THE HEROIC FIGURES OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
7126-59167-0029 HE HAS MISTER GARNETT TELLS US BEEN ACCUSED OF TIMIDITY AND COWARDICE BY UNCOMPROMISING RADICALS AND REVOLUTIONARIES IN AN ACCESS OF SELF REPROACH HE ONCE DECLARED THAT HIS CHARACTER WAS COMPRISED IN ONE WORD
7126-59167-0030 HE SHOWED NEITHER TIMIDITY NOR COWARDICE HOWEVER IN HIS DEVOTION TO TRUTH HIS FIRST AND LAST ADVICE TO YOUNG WRITERS MISTER GARNETT DECLARES WAS YOU NEED TRUTH REMORSELESS TRUTH AS REGARDS YOUR OWN SENSATIONS
7126-59167-0031 AND IF TURGENEV WAS REMORSELESS IN NOTHING ELSE HE WAS REMORSELESS IN THIS TRUTH AS REGARDS BOTH HIS OWN SENSATIONS AND THE SENSATIONS OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES
7126-59167-0032 HE SEEMS IF WE MAY JUDGE FROM A SENTENCE HE WROTE ABOUT FATHERS AND CHILDREN TO HAVE REGARDED HIMSELF ALMOST AS THE FIRST REALIST IT WAS A NEW METHOD HE SAID AS WELL AS A NEW TYPE I INTRODUCED THAT OF REALIZING INSTEAD OF IDEALIZING
7126-59167-0033 HIS CLAIM HAS AT LEAST THIS TRUTH IN IT HE WAS THE FIRST ARTIST TO APPLY THE REALISTIC METHOD TO A WORLD SEETHING WITH IDEAS AND WITH POLITICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL UNREST
7126-59167-0034 HIS ADOPTION OF THE REALISTIC METHOD HOWEVER WAS THE RESULT OF NECESSITY NO LESS THAN OF CHOICE HE SIMPLY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO WORK OTHERWISE AS HE SAID HE HAD NOT THE SORT OF IMAGINATION THAT CAN INVENT MEN AND WOMEN EASILY HE HAD ALWAYS TO DRAW FROM THE LIFE
7126-59167-0035 I OUGHT TO CONFESS HE ONCE WROTE THAT I NEVER ATTEMPTED TO CREATE A TYPE WITHOUT HAVING NOT AN IDEA BUT A LIVING PERSON IN WHOM THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS WERE HARMONIZED TOGETHER TO WORK FROM
7126-59167-0036 I HAVE ALWAYS NEEDED SOME GROUNDWORK ON WHICH I COULD TREAD FIRMLY WHEN ONE HAS PRAISED TURGENEV HOWEVER FOR THE BEAUTY OF HIS CHARACTER AND THE BEAUTIFUL TRUTH OF HIS ART ONE REMEMBERS THAT HE TOO WAS HUMAN AND THEREFORE LESS THAN PERFECT
7126-59167-0037 HIS CHIEF FAILING WAS PERHAPS THAT OF ALL THE GREAT ARTISTS HE WAS THE MOST LACKING IN EXUBERANCE THAT IS WHY HE BEGAN TO BE SCORNED IN A WORLD WHICH RATED EXUBERANCE HIGHER THAN BEAUTY OR LOVE OR PITY
7126-59167-0038 THE WORLD BEFORE THE WAR WAS AFRAID ABOVE ALL THINGS OF LOSING VITALITY AND SO IT TURNED TO CONTORTIONISTS OF GENIUS SUCH AS DOSTOEVSKY OR LESSER CONTORTIONISTS LIKE SOME OF THE FUTURISTS FOR FEAR RESTFULNESS SHOULD LEAD TO DEATH
7126-59167-0039 IT WOULD BE FOOLISH I KNOW TO PRETEND TO SUM UP DOSTOEVSKY AS A CONTORTIONIST BUT HE HAS THAT ELEMENT IN HIM MISTER CONRAD SUGGESTS A CERTAIN VICE OF MISSHAPENNESS IN DOSTOEVSKY WHEN HE PRAISES THE CHARACTERS OF TURGENEV IN COMPARISON WITH HIS
7126-59167-0040 ALL HIS CREATIONS FORTUNATE OR UNFORTUNATE OPPRESSED AND OPPRESSORS HE SAYS IN HIS FINE TRIBUTE TO TURGENEV IN MISTER GARNETT'S BOOK ARE HUMAN BEINGS NOT STRANGE BEASTS IN A MENAGERIE
7126-59167-0041 OR DAMNED SOULS KNOCKING THEMSELVES ABOUT IN THE STUFFY DARKNESS OF MYSTICAL CONTRADICTIONS THAT IS WELL SAID ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS ONLY RIGHT TO REMEMBER THAT IF TURGENEV'S CHARACTERS ARE HUMAN BEINGS
7126-59167-0042 HE UNDERSTOOD THE HAMLET IN MAN ALMOST TOO WELL FROM RUDIN TO THE YOUNG REVOLUTIONIST IN VIRGIN SOIL WHO MAKES SUCH A MESS OF HIS PROPAGANDA AMONG THE PEASANTRY HOW MANY OF HIS CHARACTERS ARE AS REMARKABLE FOR THEIR WEAKNESS AS THEIR UNSUCCESS
7126-59167-0043 TURGENEV WAS PROBABLY CONSCIOUS OF THIS PESSIMISM OF IMAGINATION IN REGARD TO HIS FELLOW MAN AT LEAST HIS RUSSIAN FELLOW MAN IN ON THE EVE WHEN HE WISHED TO CREATE A CENTRAL CHARACTER THAT WOULD ACT AS AN APPEAL TO HIS COUNTRYMEN TO
7126-59167-0044 CONQUER THEIR SLUGGISHNESS THEIR WEAKNESS AND APATHY AS MISTER GARNETT PUTS IT HE HAD TO CHOOSE A BULGARIAN NOT A RUSSIAN FOR HIS HERO MISTER GARNETT HOLDS THAT THE CHARACTERIZATION OF INSAROV THE BULGARIAN IN ON THE EVE IS A FAILURE
7126-59167-0045 AND PUTS THIS DOWN TO THE FACT THAT TURGENEV DREW HIM NOT FROM LIFE BUT FROM HEARSAY I THINK MISTER GARNETT IS WRONG I HAVE KNOWN THE COUNTERPART OF INSAROV AMONG THE MEMBERS OF AT LEAST ONE SUBJECT NATION AND THE PORTRAIT SEEMS TO ME TO BE ESSENTIALLY TRUE AND ALIVE
7126-59167-0046 LUCKILY IF TURGENEV COULD NOT PUT HIS TRUST IN RUSSIAN MEN HE BELIEVED WITH ALL HIS HEART IN THE COURAGE AND GOODNESS OF RUSSIAN WOMEN HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST GREAT NOVELISTS TO ENDOW HIS WOMEN WITH INDEPENDENCE OF SOUL
7126-59167-0047 WITH THE MAJORITY OF NOVELISTS WOMEN ARE SEXUAL OR SENTIMENTAL ACCIDENTS WITH TURGENEV WOMEN ARE EQUAL HUMAN BEINGS SAVIOURS OF MEN AND SAVIOURS OF THE WORLD
7126-59167-0048 VIRGIN SOIL BECOMES A BOOK OF HOPE INSTEAD OF DESPAIR AS THE TRIUMPHANT FIGURE OF MARIANNA THE YOUNG GIRL OF THE REVOLUTION CONQUERS THE IMAGINATION TURGENEV AS A CREATOR OF NOBLE WOMEN RANKS WITH BROWNING AND MEREDITH
7126-59167-0049 HIS REALISM WAS NOT IN THE LAST ANALYSIS A REALISM OF DISPARAGEMENT BUT A REALISM OF AFFECTION HIS FAREWELL WORDS MISTER GARNETT TELLS US WERE LIVE AND LOVE OTHERS
