2920-156224-0000 FRANCIS HAD HOPED TO SEE HIS COUSINS BEFORE HE MET THEM AT THE PARTY BUT WHEN HE CALLED AT PEGGY WALKER'S HE FOUND THAT THEY WERE OUT TAKING THEIR CUSTOMARY LONG WALK SO HE MET THEM IN MISSUS RENNIE'S DRAWING ROOM FOR THE FIRST TIME
2920-156224-0001 CERTAINLY THE TWO GIRLS IN MOURNING WERE NOT THE PLAINEST LOOKING IN THE ROOM NEITHER SISTER WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT ELSIE WAS VERY NEARLY SO AND HER RECENT SUFFERING HAD THROWN MORE INTENSITY INTO HER EXPRESSION
2920-156224-0002 AND MADE HER LOOK MORE LOVELY THAN EVER
2920-156224-0003 AND HE GRIEVED TO SEE THE TRACES OF WEARINESS OF CARE AND HE EVEN THOUGHT OF TEARS ON THE FACE WHICH TO HIM WAS THE MOST INTERESTING IN THE WORLD HE SHOOK HANDS WITH HER WARMLY AND LOOKED INQUIRINGLY IN HER FACE
2920-156224-0004 AND THEN DREW HER INTO A QUIET CORNER IN A WINDOW SEAT WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING MUCH OBSERVED ELSIE DID NOT SIT BESIDE THEM BUT LEFT THEM TO THEIR OWN CONVERSATION ASSURED THAT SHE WOULD HEAR ALL THAT SHE CARED TO KNOW BY AND BY
2920-156224-0005 YET SHE WAS NOT NEGLECTED FOR MISS RENNIE HAD TAKEN A GREAT FANCY TO HER AND WAS DETERMINED IF POSSIBLE TO GET HER PARTNERS AT MISSUS RENNIE'S PARTIES THERE NEVER WAS ANY SCARCITY OF GENTLEMEN
2920-156224-0006 FOR THEY HAD AN EXTENSIVE FAMILY CONNECTION AND MISTER RENNIE WAS A KIND AND HOSPITABLE MAN WHO HAD A LARGE ACQUAINTANCE IN THE CITY MISS RENNIE HAD JUDGED HARDLY OF JANE'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE AT FIRST SIGHT
2920-156224-0007 BUT SHE THOUGHT ELSIE A MOST ELEGANT AND INTERESTING CREATURE WE HAVE WRITTEN SO OFTEN AND SO FULLY TO EACH OTHER
2920-156224-0008 SAID JANE SMILING WE HAVE WRITTEN SO MUCH TO EACH OTHER THAT WE HAVE ALL THE MORE TO SAY JANE SAID HER COUSIN I NEVER GET A LETTER FROM YOU WITHOUT ITS MAKING ME WISH TO TALK OVER IT WITH YOU YOU HAVE NO NEWS HOWEVER I SUPPOSE
2920-156224-0009 NO NEWS SAID JANE I WROTE TO YOU OF ELSIE'S LAST BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT IT WAS A CRUEL LETTER SHE FELT IT ALL THE MORE BECAUSE SHE SAYS IT IS ALL TRUE BUT REALLY FRANCIS
2920-156224-0010 I THINK HER POETRY DID NOT DESERVE IT SHE HAS NEVER MENTIONED HER VERSES SINCE
2920-156224-0011 IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET UP THE CLASSES THAT I HOPED FOR I THINK I MUST TAKE TO MISSUS DUNN'S AND THE DRESSMAKING FOR WE CANNOT GO ON AS WE ARE DOING AH JANE MY CUP OF PROSPERITY HAS VERY MANY BITTER DROPS IN IT
2920-156224-0012 AND MINE OF ADVERSITY HAS MUCH THAT IS SALUTARY AND EVEN SWEET IN IT DO NOT THINK ME SO VERY UNHAPPY IF ANY ONE HAD TOLD ME BEFOREHAND OF THESE MONTHS THAT I HAVE PASSED SINCE MY UNCLE'S DEATH I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEM ABSOLUTELY INTOLERABLE
2920-156224-0013 BUT THERE IS NO HUMAN LOT WITHOUT ITS MITIGATIONS AND AMELIORATIONS GOD TEMPERS THE WIND TO THE SHORN LAMB I AM NOT HAPPY PERHAPS BUT I AM NOT MISERABLE I HAVE NOT TO LIVE WITH PEOPLE WHOM I DESPISE
2920-156224-0014 FOR THERE NEVER WAS A MORE ESTIMABLE WOMAN THAN PEGGY WALKER OR MORE PROMISING CHILDREN THAN HER NEPHEWS AND NIECES YOU CANNOT FANCY WHAT INTEREST I FEEL IN TOM AND HOW I AM AMBITIOUS FOR HIM HE WILL MAKE A FIGURE IN THE WORLD
2920-156224-0015 AND I WILL HELP HIM TO DO SO WE WOMEN HAVE NO CAREER FOR OURSELVES AND WE MUST FIND ROOM FOR AMBITION SOMEWHERE
2920-156224-0016 FOR YOU ARE PROVING YOURSELF THE GOOD MASTER THE CONSCIENTIOUS STEWARD OF THE BOUNTIES OF PROVIDENCE THAT I HOPED YOU WOULD BE
2920-156224-0017 I KNOW I LOOK SAD BUT DO NOT FANCY ME ALWAYS IN THIS MOOD IF YOU SAW ME IN THE EVENINGS WITH TOM AND NANCY AND JAMIE AND JESSIE AND WILLIE YOU WOULD SEE HOW CHEERFUL I CAN BE
2920-156224-0018 HERE I AM REMINDED TOO PAINFULLY OF WHAT I HAVE LOST THERE I FEEL THAT I HAVE GAINED SOMEWHAT
2920-156224-0019 BY MAKING THE BEST OF YOUR VERY HARD LOT EVERY LOT HAS ITS BEST SIDE SAID JANE AND IT IS ONLY BY LOOKING STEADILY AT IT THAT ONE CAN OBTAIN COURAGE TO BEAR THE WORST
2920-156224-0020 I SEE THIS IN VISITING THE VERY POOR PEOPLE WHOM I WROTE TO YOU ABOUT SOME PEOPLE ARE QUERULOUS IN COMPARATIVE COMFORT OTHERS HAVE THE MOST ASTONISHING POWERS OF CHEERFUL ENDURANCE
2920-156224-0021 I HAVE LEARNED UPON HOW VERY LITTLE THE HUMAN SOUL CAN BE KEPT IN WORKING ORDER FROM A POOR RHEUMATIC AND BED RIDDEN OLD WOMAN WHO IS SO GRATEFUL FOR THE USE OF ONE HAND WHILE SHE IS HELPLESS OTHERWISE
2920-156224-0022 AND WHO HAS HAD A VERY BAD HUSBAND AND SEVERAL VERY CARELESS AND COLD HEARTED CHILDREN BUT SHE HAS ONE SON WHO COMES TO SEE HER REGULARLY ONCE EVERY THREE MONTHS AND BRINGS HER THE SCANTY PITTANCE ON WHICH SHE SUBSISTS
2920-156224-0023 SINCE YOU SAY THAT YOU HAVE MORE TO GIVE THEY INTERESTED YOU VERY MUCH PARTICULARLY THOSE IN FRANCE VERY MUCH INDEED ALL THE MORE AS I ACQUIRED THE LANGUAGE I WROTE TO YOU THAT I MET WITH CLEMENCE DE VERICOURT NOW MADAME LENOIR
2920-156224-0024 IS SHE HANDSOME ASKED JANE NO
2920-156224-0025 ASKED JANE FRENCH SOCIETY IS MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN IT IS HERE BUT I MET WITH A FRENCH GENTLEMAN IN A CAFE WHO HAD KNOWN MY FATHER AND WHO RECOGNIZED MY NAME WHO INTRODUCED ME TO A GOOD MANY VERY PLEASANT SALONS
2920-156224-0026 AND TO MADAME LENOIR'S AMONG OTHERS ARNAULD IS DEAD HE FELL IN ALGERIA HIS SISTER SPEAKS OF HIM WITH THE TENDEREST AFFECTION IS SHE HAPPILY MARRIED
2920-156224-0027 AFTER ALL HER MOTHER'S SOLICITUDE IT WOULD BE HARD IF SHE TOO WERE SACRIFICED SO FAR AS I CAN SEE SHE APPEARS TO BE HAPPY THE HUSBAND IS OF SUITABLE YEARS AND GOOD CHARACTER NOT SO BRILLIANT AS HIS WIFE
2920-156224-0028 THAT FRENCH WOMEN ARE SUPERIOR TO THEIR SO CALLED LORDS AND MASTERS IT IS STRANGE TO ME WHO HAVE BEEN ALWAYS SO SHY AND SO SHUT OUT FROM SOCIETY TO BE INTRODUCED OR RATHER PLUNGED INTO SO MUCH OF IT
2920-156224-0029 A MAN WITH NO RELATIONS WHO RECOGNIZED HIS EXISTENCE AND WHO IS CONSCIOUS OF THE DOUBTFULNESS OF HIS BIRTH AS I WAS
2920-156224-0030 THAN I EVER WAS INDEED SAID JANE I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE PLEASED YOU TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED YOU SHOULD SEE IF THE WORLD DOES NOT THAT IF ONE PARTY HAS JUGGLED THE OTHER INTO A MARRIAGE WITHOUT ANY LOVE ON EITHER SIDE
2920-156224-0031 BUT DOES NOT MAKE THE BIRTH A WHIT MORE RESPECTABLE I HAD A MOTHER WHO DID NOT CARE FOR ME AND A FATHER WHO DID HIS DUTY AS HE FANCIED BY ME BUT WHO DISLIKED ME AND THEY APPEAR TO HAVE HATED ONE ANOTHER YOU EXTORTED RESPECT AND REGARD FROM YOUR FATHER
2920-156224-0032 AND MY FATHER'S NEVER WAS ANYTHING BUT SELF LOVE AND SELF WILL BUT WHATEVER OUR BIRTH MAY BE WE ARE ALL GOD'S CHILDREN AND EQUAL IN HIS EYES IN THAT RESPECT AT LEAST DID MADAME LENOIR SPEAK TO YOU OF HER MOTHER
2920-156224-0033 FOR MY FATHER'S SAKE I SAW MADAME DE VERICOURT'S PORTRAIT TOO SHE WAS PRETTIER THAN HER DAUGHTER AT LEAST IN REPOSE BUT NEITHER OF THEM WERE AT ALL LIKE MY IDEAL FOR I FORGOT THE FRENCH CLASS OF FACE AND EMBODIED MY FANCY PORTRAITS
2920-156224-0034 IN AN ENGLISH TYPE YOU ENJOYED FRENCH SOCIETY THEN VERY MUCH INDEED THE ART OF CONVERSING THESE FRENCH PEOPLE CARRY TO GREAT PERFECTION IT IS NOT FRIVOLOUS THOUGH IT IS LIGHT AND SPARKLING
2920-156224-0035 IT IS STILL LESS ARGUMENTATIVE BUT IT HAS THE KNACK OF BRINGING OUT DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THEM WE PITY THE FRENCH FOR THEIR WANT OF POLITICAL LIBERTY BUT THE SOCIAL FREEDOM THEY ENJOY IS SOME COMPENSATION
2920-156224-0036 AND THE CAREFUL OBSERVATION OF THE CONDITION AND PROSPECT OF THE SMALL PROPRIETORS SO NUMEROUS IN FRANCE AND FLANDERS THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE FRENCH SMALL LANDOWNER AND THE ENGLISH AGRICULTURAL LABOURER IS VERY GREAT
2920-156224-0037 NOTHING HAS STRUCK ME AS SO PATHETIC AS THE CONDITION OF THE ENGLISH FARM LABOURER SO HOPELESS SO CHEERLESS OUR SCOTTISH PEASANTS HAVE MORE EDUCATION MORE ENERGY AND ARE MORE DISPOSED TO EMIGRATE
2920-156224-0038 BUT THE SMALL PROPRIETORS OF FRANCE AND FLANDERS WILL TELL ANOTHER STORY FOR THEY WILL GIVE A HIGHER PRICE FOR LAND THAN THE CAPITALIST AND MAKE IT PAY THE ASTONISHING INDUSTRY OF THE FLEMISH FARMERS IN RECLAIMING THE WORST SOIL OF EUROPE
2920-156224-0039 AND MAKING IT PRODUCE THE MOST ABUNDANT CROPS SHOWS ME THE FALLACY OF OUR INSULAR NOTIONS ON THAT HEAD I CANNOT BUT REGRET THE DECREASE OF THE YEOMANRY CLASS IN GREAT BRITAIN AND THE ACCUMULATION OF LARGE ESTATES IN FEW HANDS
2920-156224-0040 AT THE BACK OF THE BLACK HILL AS IT IS CALLED I WOULD DIVIDE IT INTO ALLOTMENTS AMONG THE MOST INDUSTRIOUS AND ENERGETIC OF MY FARM LABOURERS AND SHOW THEM THE METHOD PURSUED BY THE FLEMISH FARMERS
2920-156224-0041 HE WILL CONVERT IT INTO A DESERT GIVE HIM A PERPETUITY OF A ROCK HE WILL CHANGE IT INTO A GARDEN YOUR UNCLE DID NOT THINK IT WOULD PAY TO RECLAIM THAT PIECE OF LAND I WILL TRY IF OUR PEASANTS HAVE NOT THE STUFF IN THEM TO MAKE THE MOST OF THE LAND
2920-156224-0042 WHAT AN EXCELLENT IDEA SAID JANE I KNEW YOU WOULD SYMPATHIZE WITH THIS PLAN AND WITH ANOTHER WHICH I HAVE ALSO IN MY HEAD TO BUILD NEW COTTAGES FOR ALL THE AGRICULTURAL LABOURERS ON THE ESTATE
2920-156224-0043 IT IS SHAMEFUL THAT WHILE THE PROPRIETORS HOUSES AND THE FARMERS HOUSES HAVE BEEN ENLARGED AND IMPROVED SO MUCH DURING THE LAST CENTURY THE COTTAGE OF THE HIND AND THE COTTER SHOULD STILL BE OF THE SAME MISERABLE DESCRIPTION
2920-156224-0044 AND TOO GENERALLY DONE BY THE ENCLOSED BEDS WHICH ARE NOT RIGHT THINGS IN A SANITARY POINT OF VIEW THE MONEY VALUE OF THE RENT IS INCREASED TOO
2920-156224-0045 THAN A CENTURY BACK I HAVE GOT PLANS FOR THE COTTAGES WHICH I WANTED YOU TO LOOK AT THIS MORNING I THINK THEY WILL DO YOU
2920-156224-0046 SHE WAS BROUGHT UP IN ONE OF THOSE COTTAGES YOU SPEAK OF AND WILL KNOW ALL THEIR DEFICIENCIES IT WILL SET A GOOD EXAMPLE TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD SAID JANE AND AFTER ALL
2920-156224-0047 BY BUILDING A NEW WING AND ADDING A CONSERVATORY IN THE PLACE OF YOUR MODEST LITTLE GREENHOUSE EVERY ONE KNOWS I HAVE COME TO THE ESTATE WITH MONEY IN HAND INSTEAD OF ENCUMBRANCES TO CLEAR OFF AS SO MANY PROPRIETORS HAVE
2920-156224-0048 SO THEY CAN THINK OF MY SPENDING IT IN NOTHING BUT IN INCREASING MY OWN COMFORT OR IMPORTANCE ANOTHER REASON FOR MY TRYING THESE EXPERIMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS IS TO SEE IF WE CANNOT KEEP SOME OF OUR BEST PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND OUR PICKED MEN
2920-156224-0049 AND MANY OF OUR PICKED WOMEN EMIGRATE TO AMERICA AND AUSTRALIA THE RECENT EMIGRATION TO AUSTRALIA SINCE THE GOLD DIGGINGS WERE DISCOVERED HAS BEEN ENORMOUS
2920-156224-0050 I CONFESS THAT IF I WERE IN THEIR PLACE I SHOULD DO THE SAME BUT LET MY EXPERIMENT SUCCEED IT MAY BE IMITATED WHETHER IT IS IMITATED OR NOT
2920-156224-0051 I WILL WATCH THE RESULT WITH THE GREATEST INTEREST
2920-156224-0052 SAID FRANCIS IT IS NOT FAIR THAT THE COMMONAGES SHOULD BE ENCLOSED TO ENLARGE GREAT ESTATES THE WASTE LANDS SHOULD BELONG TO THE NATION AND BE GIVEN TO THE CLASS THAT NEEDS THEM MOST AND THAT COULD PERHAPS MAKE MOST OF THEM SAID JANE
2920-156224-0053 HAS SHE NONE OF THE ALLEVIATIONS THAT YOU ARE SO GOOD AS TO MAKE THE VERY MOST OF ASKED FRANCIS
2920-156224-0054 LOST HER RELISH FOR BOTH SHE HAS FELT THAT HER ESTIMATE OF HER POWERS HAS BEEN TOO GREAT AND NOW IT IS FAR TOO HUMBLE FOR MYSELF I THINK JUST AS HIGHLY OF MY OWN ABILITIES AND ACQUIREMENTS AS EVER I DID
2920-156224-0055 I AM SORRY THAT YOUR MINISTER HAS LEFT HIS CHURCH FOR I HOPED TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH HIM AND HE LOOKED SO CHEERFUL THAT I THOUGHT HE MIGHT DO ELSIE GOOD THIS NEW CLERGYMAN DOES NOT STRIKE ME AS BEING SO GENIAL OR KINDLY
2920-156224-0056 THOUGH I CERTAINLY LIKE HIS SERMONS AND HIS DEVOTIONAL SERVICES VERY MUCH IT IS CERTAINLY NOT THE LEAST OF THE BLESSINGS OF MY ADVERSITY THAT I HAVE LEARNED TO PLACE MYSELF IN GOD'S HANDS AND TO FEEL THAT HE WILL DO ALL THINGS WELL FOR ME
2920-156224-0057 CAN YOU NOT PLACE YOUR SISTER IN THE SAME CARE ASKED FRANCIS
2920-156224-0058 ELSIE IS SO WEARY OF HER LIFE SOMETIMES IT IS DIFFICULT TO GIVE HER COURAGE THIS IS GRAVE CONVERSATION FOR A DANCING PARTY BUT YOU DO NOT SEE THE INCONGRUITY IF WE CANNOT CARRY OUR RELIGION INTO OUR AMUSEMENTS
2920-156224-0059 AND INTO OUR BUSINESS IT WILL NOT BE OF MUCH USE TO US THE SOUND OF A WELL KNOWN VOICE ARRESTED JANE'S ATTENTION IT WAS THAT OF WILLIAM DALZELL WHO WAS SHAKING HANDS WITH MISTER MISSUS AND MISS RENNIE VERY CORDIALLY AND THEN
2920-156224-0060 IN AN EMBARRASSED MANNER DOING THE SAME WITH ELSIE HOW DID OUR FRIENDS GET ACQUAINTED WITH MISTER DALZELL SAID JANE WHEN THEY WERE VISITING ME AT CROSS HALL WE HAD A GATHERING OF THE NEIGHBOURING FAMILIES AND MISSUS RENNIE DID THE HONOURS FOR ME
2920-156224-0061 MISTER DALZELL WITH HIS MOTHER AND TWO YOUNG LADY COUSINS WERE OF THE PARTY I THOUGHT THE COUNTY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE HELD THEMSELVES ALOOF FROM THE MORE PLEBEIAN SOCIETY OF AN EDINBURGH BANKER
2920-156224-0062 BUT HE AT LEAST HAS CONDESCENDED TO ACCEPT MISSUS RENNIE'S INVITATION TO HER OWN HOUSE THE EXCLUSIVENESS OF CLASSES AND SECTS AND CLIQUES IS EXTREMELY AMUSING TO ME BUT I AM ENGAGED TO DANCE THIS DANCE WITH MISS RENNIE
2920-156224-0063 SO YOU MUST EXCUSE ME AS FRANCIS WENT UP TO CLAIM MISS RENNIE'S HAND A GENTLEMAN WAS IN THE ACT OF ASKING IT
2920-156224-0064 SEE MY CARD BUT AS YOU ARE A STRANGER IN EDINBURGH YOU WILL BE OBLIGED TO ME FOR INTRODUCING YOU TO HIS COUSIN ONE OF THE SWEETEST GIRLS IN THE WORLD
2920-156224-0065 MISS RENNIE WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM LEAVING WILLIAM DALZELL AND THE STRANGER TOGETHER BUT SHE PRESENTLY RETURNED WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT MISS WILSON WAS DISENGAGED AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO BE INTRODUCED TO MISTER DALZELL
2920-156224-0066 MISS WILSON WAS WARD OF MISSUS RENNIE'S AS JANE HAD HEARD A WEST INDIAN HEIRESS SOMEWHAT STUPID AND VERY MUCH IMPRESSED WITH HER OWN WEALTH AND IMPORTANCE MISS RENNIE HAD A PITYING SORT OF LIKING FOR HER
2920-156224-0067 THOUGH SOMETIMES LAURA'S AIRS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HER AND THEY WOULD NOT SPEAK TO EACH OTHER FOR A WEEK AT A TIME SHE HAD JUST LEFT SCHOOL HAVING MADE ALL THE PROGRESS WHICH MONEY WITHOUT NATURAL ABILITY OR ANY OF THE USUAL INCENTIVES
2920-156224-0068 WITH MUCH MORE ANIMATION THAN WAS USUAL WITH HER NOW SAID MISS RENNIE I HAVE DONE MY BEST FOR MISTER DALZELL I MUST ATTEND TO MY OTHER STRANGER BEFORE I FULFIL MY ENGAGEMENT TO YOU MISTER HOGARTH AND I HOPE YOU WILL EXCUSE ME
2920-156224-0069 WHEN IT IS TO GET A PARTNER FOR ALICE MISS MELVILLE I SUPPOSE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT DANCING SHE IS SO DREADFULLY MATTER OF FACT I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING POLITICS OR SOMETHING AS BAD IN THAT CORNER ALL THIS EVENING
