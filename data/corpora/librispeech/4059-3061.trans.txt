4059-3061-0000 PREPARATIONS FOR THE BARON'S EXPEDITION INTO AFRICA DESCRIPTION OF HIS CHARIOT THE BEAUTIES OF ITS INTERIOR DECORATIONS THE ANIMALS THAT DREW IT AND THE MECHANISM OF THE WHEELS
4059-3061-0001 EVERYTHING BEING CONCLUDED AND HAVING RECEIVED MY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE VOYAGE
4059-3061-0002 AND A PRODIGIOUS CROWD OF NOBILITY AND PLACED SITTING UPON THE SUMMIT OF THE WHALE'S BONES AT THE PALACE AND HAVING REMAINED IN THIS SITUATION FOR THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS AS A TRIAL ORDEAL
4059-3061-0003 AND A SPECIMEN OF MY PERSEVERANCE AND RESOLUTION THE THIRD HOUR AFTER MIDNIGHT THEY SEATED ME IN THE CHARIOT OF QUEEN MAB IT WAS A PRODIGIOUS DIMENSION LARGE ENOUGH TO CONTAIN MORE STOWAGE THAN THE TUN OF HEIDELBERG
4059-3061-0004 AND GLOBULAR LIKE A HAZEL NUT IN FACT IT SEEMED TO BE REALLY A HAZEL NUT GROWN TO A MOST EXTRAVAGANT DIMENSION AND THAT A GREAT WORM OF PROPORTIONABLE ENORMITY HAD BORED A HOLE IN THE SHELL THROUGH THIS SAME ENTRANCE I WAS USHERED
4059-3061-0005 IT WAS AS LARGE AS A COACH DOOR AND I TOOK MY SEAT IN THE CENTRE A KIND OF CHAIR SELF BALANCED WITHOUT TOUCHING ANYTHING LIKE THE FANCIED TOMB OF MAHOMET
4059-3061-0006 THE WHOLE INTERIOR SURFACE OF THE NUTSHELL APPEARED A LUMINOUS REPRESENTATION OF ALL THE STARS OF HEAVEN THE FIXED STARS THE PLANETS AND A COMET THE STARS WERE AS LARGE AS THOSE WORN BY OUR FIRST NOBILITY
4059-3061-0007 AND THE COMET EXCESSIVELY BRILLIANT SEEMED AS IF YOU HAD ASSEMBLED ALL THE EYES OF THE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS IN THE KINGDOM AND COMBINED THEM LIKE A PEACOCK'S PLUMAGE INTO THE FORM OF A COMET THAT IS A GLOBE AND A BEARDED TAIL TO IT DIMINISHING GRADUALLY TO A POINT
4059-3061-0008 THIS BEAUTIFUL CONSTELLATION SEEMED VERY SPORTIVE AND DELIGHTFUL IT WAS MUCH IN THE FORM OF A TADPOLE AND WITHOUT CEASING WENT FULL OF PLAYFUL GIDDINESS UP AND DOWN ALL OVER THE HEAVEN ON THE CONCAVE SURFACE OF THE NUTSHELL
4059-3061-0009 ONE TIME IT WOULD BE AT THAT PART OF THE HEAVENS UNDER MY FEET AND IN THE NEXT MINUTE WOULD BE OVER MY HEAD IT WAS NEVER AT REST BUT FOR EVER GOING EAST WEST NORTH OR SOUTH AND PAID NO MORE RESPECT TO THE DIFFERENT WORLDS THAN IF THEY WERE SO MANY LANTERNS WITHOUT REFLECTORS
4059-3061-0010 OTHERS HE WOULD BURN UP AND CONSUME TO ASHES AND OTHERS AGAIN HE WOULD SPLIT INTO FRITTERS AND THEIR FRAGMENTS WOULD INSTANTLY TAKE A GLOBULAR FORM LIKE SPILLED QUICKSILVER AND BECOME SATELLITES TO WHATEVER OTHER WORLDS THEY SHOULD HAPPEN TO MEET WITH IN THEIR CAREER
4059-3061-0011 IN SHORT THE WHOLE SEEMED AN EPITOME OF THE CREATION PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE AND ALL THAT PASSES AMONG THE STARS DURING ONE THOUSAND YEARS WAS HERE GENERALLY PERFORMED IN AS MANY SECONDS I SURVEYED ALL THE BEAUTIES OF THE CHARIOT WITH WONDER AND DELIGHT
4059-3061-0012 CERTAINLY CRIED I THIS IS HEAVEN IN MINIATURE IN SHORT I TOOK THE REINS IN MY HAND BUT BEFORE I PROCEED ON MY ADVENTURES I SHALL MENTION THE REST OF MY ATTENDANT FURNITURE THE CHARIOT WAS DRAWN BY A TEAM OF NINE BULLS HARNESSED TO IT
4059-3061-0013 THREE AFTER THREE IN THE FIRST RANK WAS A MOST TREMENDOUS BULL NAMED JOHN MOWMOWSKY THE REST WERE CALLED JACKS IN GENERAL BUT NOT DIGNIFIED BY ANY PARTICULAR DENOMINATION
4059-3061-0014 THEY WERE ALL SHOD FOR THE JOURNEY NOT INDEED LIKE HORSES WITH IRON OR AS BULLOCKS COMMONLY ARE TO DRAG ON A CART BUT WERE SHOD WITH MEN'S SKULLS EACH OF THEIR FEET WAS HOOF AND ALL CRAMMED INTO A MAN'S HEAD CUT OFF FOR THE PURPOSE
4059-3061-0015 AND FASTENED THEREIN WITH A KIND OF CEMENT OR PASTE
4059-3061-0016 WITH THESE SKULL SHOES THE CREATURES COULD PERFORM ASTONISHING JOURNEYS AND SLIDE UPON THE WATER OR UPON THE OCEAN WITH GREAT VELOCITY THE HARNESSES WERE FASTENED WITH GOLDEN BUCKLES AND DECKED WITH STUDS IN A SUPERB STYLE
4059-3061-0017 AND THE CREATURES WERE RIDDEN BY NINE POSTILLIONS CRICKETS OF A GREAT SIZE AS LARGE AS MONKEYS
4059-3061-0018 AND WERE CONTINUALLY CHIRPING AT A MOST INFERNAL RATE LOUD IN PROPORTION TO THEIR BODIES THE WHEELS OF THE CHARIOT CONSISTED OF UPWARDS OF TEN THOUSAND SPRINGS FORMED SO AS TO GIVE THE GREATER IMPETUOSITY TO THE VEHICLE
4059-3061-0019 AND WERE MORE COMPLEX THAN A DOZEN CLOCKS LIKE THAT OF STRASBURGH
