4442-2868-0000 ONCE THERE WAS A GREAT KING IN BRITAIN NAMED UTHER AND WHEN HE DIED THE OTHER KINGS AND PRINCES DISPUTED OVER THE KINGDOM EACH WANTING IT FOR HIMSELF BUT KING UTHER HAD A SON NAMED ARTHUR THE RIGHTFUL HEIR TO THE THRONE

4442-2868-0003 WHEN THE KINGS AND PRINCES COULD NOT BE KEPT IN CHECK ANY LONGER AND SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE TO DETERMINE WHO WAS TO BE KING MERLIN MADE THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY SEND FOR THEM ALL TO COME TO LONDON IT WAS CHRISTMAS TIME
4442-2868-0004 AND PRAYER WAS MADE THAT SOME SIGN SHOULD BE GIVEN TO SHOW WHO WAS THE RIGHTFUL KING WHEN THE SERVICE WAS OVER THERE APPEARED A STRANGE STONE IN THE CHURCHYARD AGAINST THE HIGH ALTAR IT WAS A GREAT WHITE STONE LIKE MARBLE WITH SOMETHING SUNK IN IT THAT LOOKED LIKE A STEEL ANVIL
4442-2868-0005 AND IN THE ANVIL WAS DRIVEN A GREAT GLISTENING SWORD THE SWORD HAD LETTERS OF GOLD WRITTEN ON IT WHICH READ WHOSO PULLETH OUT THIS SWORD OF THIS STONE AND ANVIL IS RIGHTWISE KING BORN OF ALL ENGLAND ALL WONDERED AT THE STRANGE SWORD AND ITS STRANGE WRITING
4442-2868-0006 AND WHEN THE ARCHBISHOP HIMSELF CAME OUT AND GAVE PERMISSION MANY OF THE KNIGHTS TRIED TO PULL THE SWORD FROM THE STONE HOPING TO BE KING BUT NO ONE COULD MOVE IT A HAIR'S BREADTH
4442-2868-0007 BUT DOUBT NOT GOD WILL MAKE HIM KNOWN THEN THEY SET A GUARD OF TEN KNIGHTS TO KEEP THE STONE AND THE ARCHBISHOP APPOINTED A DAY WHEN ALL SHOULD COME TOGETHER TO TRY AT THE STONE KINGS FROM FAR AND NEAR IN THE MEANTIME SPLENDID JOUSTS WERE HELD OUTSIDE LONDON
4442-2868-0008 AND BOTH KNIGHTS AND COMMONS WERE BIDDEN SIR ECTOR CAME UP TO THE JOUSTS WITH OTHERS AND WITH HIM RODE KAY AND ARTHUR
4442-2868-0009 BUT HE HAD LEFT HIS SWORD BEHIND
4442-2868-0010 I WILL WELL SAID ARTHUR AND RODE BACK FOR IT BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE CASTLE THE LADY AND ALL HER HOUSEHOLD WERE AT THE JOUSTING
4442-2868-0011 THEREAT ARTHUR SAID TO HIMSELF MY BROTHER SIR KAY SHALL NOT BE WITHOUT A SWORD THIS DAY AND HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD HE HAD SEEN IN THE CHURCHYARD I WILL TO THE CHURCHYARD HE SAID AND TAKE THAT SWORD WITH ME
4442-2868-0012 TIED HIS HORSE TO THE STILE AND WENT UP TO THE STONE
4442-2868-0013 AND THE SWORD WAS THERE ALONE GOING UP TO THE STONE YOUNG ARTHUR TOOK THE GREAT SWORD BY THE HILT AND LIGHTLY AND FIERCELY HE DREW IT OUT OF THE ANVIL THEN HE RODE STRAIGHT TO SIR KAY AND GAVE IT TO HIM
4442-2868-0014 SIR LO HERE IS THE SWORD OF THE STONE I MUST BE KING OF THE LAND BUT SIR ECTOR ASKED HIM WHERE HE GOT THE SWORD AND WHEN SIR KAY SAID FROM MY BROTHER HE ASKED ARTHUR HOW HE GOT IT WHEN ARTHUR TOLD HIM SIR ECTOR BOWED HIS HEAD BEFORE HIM
4442-2868-0015 NEVER MAN SHOULD HAVE DRAWN OUT THIS SWORD BUT HE THAT SHALL BE RIGHTWISE KING OF THIS LAND NOW LET ME SEE WHETHER YE CAN PUT THE SWORD AS IT WAS IN THE STONE AND PULL IT OUT AGAIN STRAIGHTWAY ARTHUR PUT THE SWORD BACK THEN SIR ECTOR TRIED TO PULL IT OUT
4442-2868-0016 AND AFTER HIM SIR KAY BUT NEITHER COULD STIR IT THEN ARTHUR PULLED IT OUT THEREUPON SIR ECTOR AND SIR KAY KNEELED UPON THE GROUND BEFORE HIM ALAS SAID ARTHUR MINE OWN DEAR FATHER AND BROTHER WHY KNEEL YE TO ME
4442-2868-0017 SIR ECTOR TOLD HIM THEN ALL ABOUT HIS ROYAL BIRTH AND HOW HE HAD BEEN TAKEN PRIVILY AWAY BY MERLIN BUT WHEN ARTHUR FOUND SIR ECTOR WAS NOT TRULY HIS FATHER
4442-2868-0018 AND HE BEGGED HIS FATHER AND BROTHER TO LOVE HIM STILL SIR ECTOR ASKED THAT SIR KAY MIGHT BE SENESCHAL WHEN ARTHUR WAS KING ARTHUR PROMISED WITH ALL HIS HEART THEN THEY WENT TO THE ARCHBISHOP AND TOLD HIM THAT THE SWORD HAD FOUND ITS MASTER
4442-2868-0019 THE ARCHBISHOP APPOINTED A DAY FOR THE TRIAL TO BE MADE IN THE SIGHT OF ALL MEN AND ON THAT DAY THE PRINCES AND KNIGHTS CAME TOGETHER
4442-2868-0020 BUT AS BEFORE NONE COULD SO MUCH AS STIR IT THEN CAME ARTHUR AND PULLED IT EASILY FROM ITS PLACE THE KNIGHTS AND KINGS WERE TERRIBLY ANGRY THAT A BOY FROM NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR HAD BEATEN THEM AND THEY REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM KING THEY APPOINTED ANOTHER DAY FOR ANOTHER GREAT TRIAL
4442-2868-0021 THREE TIMES THEY DID THIS AND EVERY TIME THE SAME THING HAPPENED AT LAST AT THE FEAST OF PENTECOST ARTHUR AGAIN PULLED OUT THE SWORD BEFORE ALL THE KNIGHTS AND THE COMMONS AND THEN THE COMMONS ROSE UP AND CRIED THAT HE SHOULD BE KING AND THAT THEY WOULD SLAY ANY WHO DENIED HIM
4442-2868-0022 SO ARTHUR BECAME KING OF BRITAIN AND ALL GAVE HIM ALLEGIANCE TARPEIA THERE WAS ONCE A GIRL NAMED TARPEIA WHOSE FATHER WAS GUARD OF THE OUTER GATE OF THE CITADEL OF ROME IT WAS A TIME OF WAR
4442-2868-0023 THEIR CAMP WAS CLOSE OUTSIDE THE CITY WALL
4442-2868-0024 AND SOMETIMES SHE STAYED ABOUT AND LET THE STRANGE MEN TALK WITH HER BECAUSE SHE LIKED TO LOOK AT THEIR BRIGHT SILVER ORNAMENTS
4442-2868-0025 AND THEY SAW THAT SHE HAD GREEDY EYES FOR THEIR ORNAMENTS SO DAY BY DAY THEY TALKED WITH HER AND SHOWED HER THEIR SILVER RINGS AND TEMPTED HER AND AT LAST TARPEIA MADE A BARGAIN TO BETRAY HER CITY TO THEM SHE SAID SHE WOULD UNLOCK THE GREAT GATE AND LET THEM IN IF THEY WOULD GIVE HER WHAT THEY WORE ON THEIR LEFT ARMS
4442-2868-0026 THE NIGHT CAME WHEN IT WAS PERFECTLY DARK AND STILL TARPEIA STOLE FROM HER BED TOOK THE GREAT KEY FROM ITS PLACE AND SILENTLY UNLOCKED THE GATE WHICH PROTECTED THE CITY OUTSIDE IN THE DARK STOOD THE SOLDIERS OF THE ENEMY WAITING
4442-2868-0027 AS THE FIRST MAN CAME INSIDE TARPEIA STRETCHED FORTH HER HAND FOR HER PRICE THE SOLDIER LIFTED HIGH HIS LEFT ARM TAKE THY REWARD HE SAID AND AS HE SPOKE HE HURLED UPON HER THAT WHICH HE WORE UPON IT DOWN UPON HER HEAD CRASHED
4442-2868-0028 NOT THE SILVER RINGS OF THE SOLDIER BUT THE GREAT BRASS SHIELD HE CARRIED IN BATTLE SHE SANK BENEATH IT TO THE GROUND TAKE THY REWARD SAID THE NEXT AND HIS SHIELD RANG AGAINST THE FIRST THY REWARD SAID THE NEXT AND THE NEXT AND THE NEXT AND THE NEXT
4442-2868-0029 EVERY MAN WORE HIS SHIELD ON HIS LEFT ARM SO TARPEIA LAY BURIED BENEATH THE REWARD SHE HAD CLAIMED
4442-2868-0030 DOWN BY THE RIVER WERE FIELDS OF BARLEY AND RYE AND GOLDEN OATS WHEAT GREW THERE TOO AND THE HEAVIEST AND RICHEST EARS BENT LOWEST IN HUMILITY OPPOSITE THE CORN WAS A FIELD OF BUCKWHEAT BUT THE BUCKWHEAT NEVER BENT
4442-2868-0031 IT HELD ITS HEAD PROUD AND STIFF ON THE STEM THE WISE OLD WILLOW TREE BY THE RIVER LOOKED DOWN ON THE FIELDS AND THOUGHT HIS THOUGHTS ONE DAY A DREADFUL STORM CAME THE FIELD FLOWERS FOLDED THEIR LEAVES TOGETHER AND BOWED THEIR HEADS
4442-2868-0032 BUT THE BUCKWHEAT STOOD STRAIGHT AND PROUD BEND YOUR HEAD AS WE DO CALLED THE FIELD FLOWERS I HAVE NO NEED TO SAID THE BUCKWHEAT BEND YOUR HEAD AS WE DO WARNED THE GOLDEN WHEAT EARS
4442-2868-0033 I WILL NOT BEND MY HEAD SAID THE BUCKWHEAT THEN THE OLD WILLOW TREE SPOKE CLOSE YOUR FLOWERS AND BEND YOUR LEAVES DO NOT LOOK AT THE LIGHTNING WHEN THE CLOUD BURSTS EVEN MEN CANNOT DO THAT THE SIGHT OF HEAVEN WOULD STRIKE THEM BLIND
4442-2868-0034 INFERIOR INDEED SAID THE BUCKWHEAT NOW I WILL LOOK AND HE LOOKED STRAIGHT UP WHILE THE LIGHTNING FLASHED ACROSS THE SKY WHEN THE DREADFUL STORM HAD PASSED THE FLOWERS AND THE WHEAT RAISED THEIR DROOPING HEADS CLEAN AND REFRESHED IN THE PURE SWEET AIR
4442-2868-0035 THE WILLOW TREE SHOOK THE GENTLE DROPS FROM ITS LEAVES BUT THE BUCKWHEAT LAY LIKE A WEED IN THE FIELD SCORCHED BLACK BY THE LIGHTNING
4442-2868-0036 THE GREEK GOD PAN THE GOD OF THE OPEN AIR WAS A GREAT MUSICIAN HE PLAYED ON A PIPE OF REEDS AND THE SOUND OF HIS REED PIPE WAS SO SWEET THAT HE GREW PROUD AND BELIEVED HIMSELF GREATER THAN THE CHIEF MUSICIAN OF THE GODS APOLLO THE SUN GOD
4442-2868-0037 SO HE CHALLENGED GREAT APOLLO TO MAKE BETTER MUSIC THAN HE APOLLO CONSENTED TO THE TEST FOR HE WISHED TO PUNISH PAN'S VANITY AND THEY CHOSE THE MOUNTAIN TMOLUS FOR JUDGE SINCE NO ONE IS SO OLD AND WISE AS THE HILLS
4442-2868-0038 WHEN PAN AND APOLLO CAME BEFORE TMOLUS TO PLAY THEIR FOLLOWERS CAME WITH THEM TO HEAR AND ONE OF THOSE WHO CAME WITH PAN WAS A MORTAL NAMED MIDAS FIRST PAN PLAYED HE BLEW ON HIS REED PIPE
4442-2868-0039 AND OUT CAME A TUNE SO WILD AND YET SO COAXING THAT THE BIRDS HOPPED FROM THE TREES TO GET NEAR THE SQUIRRELS CAME RUNNING FROM THEIR HOLES AND THE VERY TREES SWAYED AS IF THEY WANTED TO DANCE THE FAUNS LAUGHED ALOUD FOR JOY AS THE MELODY TICKLED THEIR FURRY LITTLE EARS
4442-2868-0040 AND MIDAS THOUGHT IT THE SWEETEST MUSIC IN THE WORLD THEN APOLLO ROSE HIS HAIR SHOOK DROPS OF LIGHT FROM ITS CURLS HIS ROBES WERE LIKE THE EDGE OF THE SUNSET CLOUD
4442-2868-0041 AND WHEN HE TOUCHED THE STRINGS OF THE LYRE SUCH MUSIC STOLE UPON THE AIR AS NEVER GOD NOR MORTAL HEARD BEFORE THE WILD CREATURES OF THE WOOD CROUCHED STILL AS STONE THE TREES KEPT EVERY LEAF FROM RUSTLING EARTH AND AIR WERE SILENT AS A DREAM
4442-2868-0042 TO HEAR SUCH MUSIC CEASE WAS LIKE BIDDING FAREWELL TO FATHER AND MOTHER WHEN THE CHARM WAS BROKEN THE HEARERS FELL AT APOLLO'S FEET AND PROCLAIMED THE VICTORY HIS ALL BUT MIDAS
4442-2868-0043 IF THINE EARS ARE SO DULL MORTAL SAID APOLLO THEY SHALL TAKE THE SHAPE THAT SUITS THEM AND HE TOUCHED THE EARS OF MIDAS AND STRAIGHTWAY THE DULL EARS GREW LONG POINTED AND FURRY AND THEY TURNED THIS WAY AND THAT THEY WERE THE EARS OF AN ASS
4442-2868-0044 FOR A LONG TIME MIDAS MANAGED TO HIDE THE TELL TALE EARS FROM EVERYONE BUT AT LAST A SERVANT DISCOVERED THE SECRET HE KNEW HE MUST NOT TELL YET HE COULD NOT BEAR NOT TO SO ONE DAY HE WENT INTO THE MEADOW SCOOPED A LITTLE HOLLOW IN THE TURF AND WHISPERED THE SECRET INTO THE EARTH
4442-2868-0045 THEN HE COVERED IT UP AGAIN AND WENT AWAY BUT ALAS A BED OF REEDS SPRANG UP FROM THE SPOT AND WHISPERED THE SECRET TO THE GRASS THE GRASS TOLD IT TO THE TREE TOPS
4442-2868-0046 AND TO THIS DAY WHEN THE WIND SETS THE REEDS NODDING TOGETHER THEY WHISPER LAUGHING MIDAS HAS THE EARS OF AN ASS OH HUSH HUSH
4442-2868-0047 THIS ONE IS THE STORY WHICH GREW UP IN MY MIND ABOUT THE BARE OUTLINE RELATED TO ME BY ONE OF MISSUS RUTAN'S HEARERS WHAT THE ORIGINAL TELLER SAID I NEVER KNEW BUT WHAT THE LISTENER FELT WAS CLEAR
4442-2868-0048 ONCE THERE WERE TWO BROTHERS ONE WAS RICH AND ONE WAS POOR THE RICH ONE WAS RATHER MEAN WHEN THE POOR BROTHER USED TO COME TO ASK FOR THINGS IT ANNOYED HIM AND FINALLY ONE DAY HE SAID THERE
4442-2868-0049 I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU THIS TIME BUT THE NEXT TIME YOU WANT ANYTHING YOU CAN GO BELOW FOR IT
4442-2868-0050 THERE WAS A CHIEF MAN HE HAD A LONG CURLY TAIL THAT CURLED UP BEHIND AND TWO UGLY LITTLE HORNS JUST OVER HIS EARS AND ONE FOOT WAS VERY QUEER INDEED AND AS SOON AS ANYONE CAME IN THE DOOR THESE MEN WOULD CATCH HIM UP AND PUT HIM OVER ONE OF THE FIRES AND TURN HIM ON A SPIT
4442-2868-0051 EH HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW AND OF COURSE THE POOR PEOPLE SCREAMED AND SCREECHED AND SAID LET US OUT LET US OUT THAT WAS JUST WHAT THE CHIEF MAN WANTED WHEN THE POOR BROTHER CAME IN
4442-2868-0052 AND OF COURSE THE CHIEF MAN CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID EH HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW BUT THE POOR BROTHER DID NOT SAY LET ME OUT LET ME OUT HE SAID PRETTY WELL THANK YOU THE CHIEF MAN GRUNTED AND SAID TO THE OTHER MEN MAKE THE FIRE HOTTER
4442-2868-0053 THE CHIEF MAN DID NOT LIKE THIS AT ALL BECAUSE OF COURSE THE WHOLE OBJECT IN LIFE OF THE PEOPLE BELOW WAS TO MAKE THEIR VICTIMS UNCOMFORTABLE
4442-2868-0054 BUT EVERY TIME HE ASKED THE POOR BROTHER HOW HE FELT THE POOR BROTHER WOULD SAY VERY MUCH BETTER AND AT LAST HE SAID PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE THANK YOU COULDN'T BE BETTER YOU SEE WHEN THE POOR BROTHER WAS ON EARTH HE HAD NEVER ONCE HAD MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY COAL ENOUGH TO KEEP HIM WARM
4442-2868-0055 SO HE LIKED THE HEAT AT LAST THE CHIEF MAN COULD STAND IT NO LONGER OH LOOK HERE HE SAID YOU CAN GO HOME OH NO THANK YOU SAID THE POOR BROTHER I LIKE IT HERE YOU MUST GO HOME SAID THE CHIEF MAN
4442-2868-0056 BUT I WON'T GO HOME SAID THE POOR BROTHER THE CHIEF MAN WENT AWAY AND TALKED WITH THE OTHER MEN BUT NO MATTER WHAT THEY DID THEY COULD NOT MAKE THE POOR BROTHER UNCOMFORTABLE
4442-2868-0057 WHAT HAVE YOU GOT SAID THE POOR BROTHER WELL SAID THE CHIEF MAN IF YOU'LL GO HOME QUIETLY I'LL GIVE YOU THE LITTLE MILL THAT STANDS BEHIND MY DOOR WHAT'S THE GOOD OF IT SAID THE POOR BROTHER IT IS THE MOST WONDERFUL MILL IN THE WORLD SAID THE CHIEF MAN
4442-2868-0058 GRIND THIS LITTLE MILL AND GRIND QUICKLY AND THE MILL WILL GRIND THAT THING UNTIL YOU SAY THE MAGIC WORD TO STOP IT THAT SOUNDS NICE SAID THE POOR BROTHER I'LL TAKE IT AND HE TOOK THE LITTLE MILL UNDER HIS ARM AND WENT UP AND UP AND UP TILL HE CAME TO HIS OWN HOUSE
4442-2868-0059 WHEN HE WAS IN FRONT OF HIS LITTLE OLD HUT HE PUT THE LITTLE MILL DOWN ON THE GROUND AND SAID TO IT GRIND A FINE HOUSE LITTLE MILL AND GRIND QUICKLY
4442-2868-0060 AND JUST AS THE LITTLE MILL GROUND THE LAST STEP OF THE LAST FLIGHT OF STEPS THE POOR BROTHER SAID THE MAGIC WORD AND IT STOPPED THEN HE TOOK IT ROUND TO WHERE THE BARN WAS AND SAID GRIND CATTLE LITTLE MILL AND GRIND QUICKLY AND THE LITTLE MILL GROUND AND GROUND AND GROUND
4442-2868-0061 AND OUT CAME GREAT FAT COWS AND LITTLE WOOLLY LAMBS AND FINE LITTLE PIGS
4442-2868-0062 THE POOR BROTHER SAID THE MAGIC WORD AND IT STOPPED HE DID THE SAME THING WITH CROPS FOR HIS CATTLE PRETTY CLOTHES FOR HIS DAUGHTERS AND EVERYTHING ELSE THEY WANTED AT LAST HE HAD EVERYTHING HE WANTED AND SO HE STOOD THE LITTLE MILL BEHIND HIS DOOR
4442-2868-0063 THE POOR BROTHER TOLD HIM ALL ABOUT IT HE SAID IT ALL COMES FROM THAT LITTLE MILL BEHIND MY DOOR ALL I HAVE TO DO WHEN I WANT ANYTHING IS TO NAME IT TO THE LITTLE MILL AND SAY GRIND THAT LITTLE MILL AND GRIND QUICKLY AND THE LITTLE MILL WILL GRIND THAT THING UNTIL
4442-2868-0064 WILL YOU LEND ME THE LITTLE MILL HE SAID WHY YES SAID THE POOR BROTHER I WILL SO THE RICH BROTHER TOOK THE LITTLE MILL UNDER HIS ARM AND STARTED ACROSS THE FIELDS TO HIS HOUSE WHEN HE GOT NEAR HOME HE SAW THE FARM HANDS COMING IN FROM THE FIELDS FOR THEIR LUNCHEON NOW YOU REMEMBER
4442-2868-0065 HE WAS RATHER MEAN HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF IT IS A WASTE OF GOOD TIME FOR THEM TO COME INTO THE HOUSE THEY SHALL HAVE THEIR PORRIDGE WHERE THEY ARE HE CALLED ALL THE MEN TO HIM AND MADE THEM BRING THEIR PORRIDGE BOWLS
4442-2868-0066 THEN HE SET THE LITTLE MILL DOWN ON THE GROUND AND SAID TO IT GRIND OATMEAL PORRIDGE LITTLE MILL AND GRIND QUICKLY THE LITTLE MILL GROUND AND GROUND AND GROUND AND OUT CAME DELICIOUS OATMEAL PORRIDGE EACH MAN HELD HIS BOWL UNDER THE SPOUT WHEN THE LAST BOWL WAS FILLED
4442-2868-0067 THE PORRIDGE RAN OVER ON THE GROUND THAT'S ENOUGH LITTLE MILL SAID THE RICH BROTHER YOU MAY STOP AND STOP QUICKLY BUT THIS WAS NOT THE MAGIC WORD AND THE LITTLE MILL DID NOT STOP IT GROUND AND GROUND AND GROUND AND THE PORRIDGE RAN ALL ROUND AND MADE A LITTLE POOL THE RICH BROTHER SAID
4442-2868-0068 NO NO LITTLE MILL I SAID STOP GRINDING AND STOP QUICKLY BUT THE LITTLE MILL GROUND AND GROUND FASTER THAN EVER AND PRESENTLY THERE WAS A REGULAR POND OF PORRIDGE ALMOST UP TO THEIR KNEES THE RICH BROTHER SAID STOP GRINDING IN EVERY KIND OF WAY HE CALLED THE LITTLE MILL NAMES
4442-2868-0069 BUT NOTHING DID ANY GOOD THE LITTLE MILL GROUND PORRIDGE JUST THE SAME AT LAST THE MEN SAID GO AND GET YOUR BROTHER TO STOP THE LITTLE MILL OR WE SHALL BE DROWNED IN PORRIDGE SO THE RICH BROTHER STARTED FOR HIS BROTHER'S HOUSE
4442-2868-0070 HIS BROTHER LAUGHED WHEN HE HEARD THE STORY
4442-2868-0071 AND THEN THE POOR BROTHER WHISPERED THE MAGIC WORD AND THE LITTLE MILL STOPPED BUT THE PORRIDGE WAS A LONG TIME SOAKING INTO THE GROUND AND NOTHING WOULD EVER GROW THERE AFTERWARDS EXCEPT OATMEAL
4442-2868-0072 THE RICH BROTHER DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE MUCH ABOUT THE LITTLE MILL AFTER THIS SO THE POOR BROTHER TOOK IT HOME AGAIN AND PUT IT BEHIND THE DOOR AND THERE IT STAYED A LONG LONG WHILE YEARS AFTERWARDS A SEA CAPTAIN CAME THERE ON A VISIT
4442-2868-0073 OH I DARESAY YOU HAVE SEEN WONDERFUL THINGS BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU EVER SAW ANYTHING MORE WONDERFUL THAN THE LITTLE MILL THAT STANDS BEHIND MY DOOR WHAT IS WONDERFUL ABOUT THAT SAID THE SEA CAPTAIN WHY SAID THE POOR BROTHER
4442-2868-0074 ANYTHING IN THE WORLD YOU WANT YOU HAVE ONLY TO NAME IT TO THE LITTLE MILL AND SAY GRIND THAT LITTLE MILL AND GRIND QUICKLY AND IT WILL GRIND THAT THING UNTIL
4442-2868-0075 WILL YOU LEND ME THAT LITTLE MILL HE SAID EAGERLY THE POOR BROTHER SMILED A LITTLE BUT HE SAID YES AND THE SEA CAPTAIN TOOK THE LITTLE MILL UNDER HIS ARM AND WENT ON BOARD HIS SHIP AND SAILED AWAY THEY HAD HEAD WINDS AND STORMS AND THEY WERE SO LONG AT SEA THAT SOME OF THE FOOD GAVE OUT WORST OF ALL THE SALT GAVE OUT
4442-2868-0076 BRING UP THE SALT BOX HE SAID TO THE COOK WE WILL HAVE SALT ENOUGH

4442-2868-0079 THE SALT COVERED ALL THE DECKS AND POURED DOWN INTO THE HOLD AND AT LAST THE SHIP BEGAN TO SETTLE IN THE WATER SALT IS VERY HEAVY BUT JUST BEFORE THE SHIP SANK TO THE WATER LINE THE CAPTAIN HAD A BRIGHT THOUGHT HE THREW THE LITTLE MILL OVERBOARD IT FELL RIGHT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
4442-2868-0080 AND IT HAS BEEN GRINDING SALT EVER SINCE
4442-2868-0081 I HAVE VENTURED TO GIVE THIS IN THE SOMEWHAT HIBERNIAN PHRASEOLOGY SUGGESTED BY THE ORIGINAL BECAUSE I HAVE FOUND THAT THE HUMOUR OF THE MANNER OF IT APPEALS QUITE AS READILY TO THE BOYS AND GIRLS OF MY ACQUAINTANCE AS TO MATURER FRIENDS AND THEY DISTINGUISH AS QUICKLY BETWEEN THE SAVOUR OF IT AND ANY UNINTENTIONAL CRUDENESS OF DICTION
4442-2868-0082 ONCE UPON A TIME
4442-2868-0083 AND THEY HAD ONE SON WHOSE NAME WAS BILLY AND BILLY HAD A BULL HE WAS VERY FOND OF AND THE BULL WAS JUST AS FOND OF HIM AND WHEN THE QUEEN CAME TO DIE SHE PUT IT AS HER LAST REQUEST TO THE KING THAT

4442-2868-0134 A LONG WAY OFF ACROSS THE OCEAN THERE IS A LITTLE COUNTRY WHERE THE GROUND IS LOWER THAN THE LEVEL OF THE SEA INSTEAD OF HIGHER AS IT IS HERE OF COURSE THE WATER WOULD RUN IN AND COVER THE LAND AND HOUSES IF SOMETHING WERE NOT DONE TO KEEP IT OUT BUT SOMETHING IS DONE
4442-2868-0135 THE PEOPLE BUILD GREAT THICK WALLS ALL ROUND THE COUNTRY AND THE WALLS KEEP THE SEA OUT YOU SEE HOW MUCH DEPENDS ON THOSE WALLS
