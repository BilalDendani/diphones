8565-290391-0013 ADMIRALTY LONDON TWENTY FOURTH OCTOBER
8565-290391-0014 IN BRINGING HOME THE ONLY AUTHENTIC INTELLIGENCE OF THE DEATH OF THE LATE SIR JOHN FRANKLIN AND OF THE FATE OF THE CREWS OF THE EREBUS AND TERROR HER MAJESTY HAS BEEN PLEASED BY HER ORDER IN COUNCIL OF THE TWENTY SECOND INSTANT
8565-290391-0015 VIZ FROM THE THIRTIETH JUNE EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN TO THE TWENTY FIRST SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE TO RECKON AS TIME SERVED BY A CAPTAIN IN COMMAND OF ONE OF HER MAJESTY'S SHIPS AND MY LORDS HAVE GIVEN THE NECESSARY DIRECTIONS ACCORDINGLY I AM SIR
8565-290391-0016 AND ALSO LET IT BE SAID TO THAT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA MANY HAVE BEEN THE EFFORTS MADE TO DISCOVER THE ROUTE FOLLOWED BY OUR MISSING EXPLORERS THE HIGHLY DESERVING MEN WHO HAVE SO ZEALOUSLY SEARCHED THE ARCTIC SEAS AND LANDS IN THIS CAUSE MUST NOW REJOICE
8565-290391-0017 THE MERIT OF RESCUING FROM THE FROZEN NORTH THE RECORD OF THE LAST DAYS OF FRANKLIN HAS FALLEN TO THE SHARE OF HIS NOBLE MINDED WIDOW LADY FRANKLIN HAS INDEED WELL SHOWN WHAT A DEVOTED AND TRUE HEARTED ENGLISH WOMAN CAN ACCOMPLISH
8565-290391-0018 THE MOMENT THAT RELICS OF THE EXPEDITION COMMANDED BY HER HUSBAND WERE BROUGHT HOME IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR BY RAE AND THAT SHE HEARD OF THE ACCOUNT GIVEN TO HIM BY THE ESQUIMAUX OF A LARGE PARTY OF ENGLISHMEN HAVING BEEN SEEN STRUGGLING WITH DIFFICULTIES ON THE ICE NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE BACK OR GREAT FISH RIVER
8565-290391-0019 SHE RESOLVED TO EXPEND ALL HER AVAILABLE MEANS ALREADY MUCH EXHAUSTED IN FOUR OTHER INDEPENDENT EXPEDITIONS IN AN EXPLORATION OF THE LIMITED AREA TO WHICH THE SEARCH MUST THENCEFORWARD BE NECESSARILY RESTRICTED
8565-290391-0020 AND THAT HE WAS PRECLUDED FROM ACCEDING TO THEIR PETITION BY NOTHING BUT THE STRONGLY EXPRESSED OPINION OF OFFICIAL AUTHORITIES THAT AFTER SO MANY FAILURES THE GOVERNMENT WERE NO LONGER JUSTIFIED IN SENDING OUT MORE BRAVE MEN TO ENCOUNTER FRESH DANGERS IN A CAUSE WHICH WAS VIEWED AS HOPELESS
8565-290391-0021 HENCE IT DEVOLVED ON LADY FRANKLIN AND HER FRIENDS TO BE THE SOLE MEANS OF ENDEAVORING TO BRING TO LIGHT THE TRUE HISTORY OF HER HUSBAND'S VOYAGE AND FATE LOOKING TO THE LIST OF NAVAL WORTHIES WHO DURING THE PRECEDING YEARS HAD BEEN EXPLORING THE ARCTIC REGIONS
8565-290391-0022 LADY FRANKLIN WAS HIGHLY GRATIFIED WHEN SHE OBTAINED THE WILLING SERVICES OF CAPTAIN M'CLINTOCK TO COMMAND THE YACHT FOX WHICH SHE HAD PURCHASED FOR THAT OFFICER HAD SIGNALLY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF IN THE VOYAGES OF SIR JOHN ROSS AND CAPTAIN NOW ADMIRAL AUSTIN
8565-290391-0023 AND ESPECIALLY IN HIS EXTENSIVE JOURNEYS ON THE ICE WHEN ASSOCIATED WITH CAPTAIN KELLETT WITH SUCH A LEADER SHE COULD NOT BUT ENTERTAIN SANGUINE HOPES OF SUCCESS WHEN THE FAST AND WELL ADAPTED LITTLE VESSEL SAILED FROM ABERDEEN ON THE FIRST OF JULY EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN
8565-290391-0024 WHICH AFTER SUNDRY MISHAPS WAS AGAIN STARTING TO CROSS BAFFIN'S BAY
8565-290391-0025 THE REAL DIFFICULTIES OF THE ENTERPRISE WERE TO COMMENCE ANY SUCH MISGIVINGS WERE HAPPILY ILLUSORY
8565-290391-0026 AND THEN THROUGH THE HITHERTO UNNAVIGATED WATERS OF BELLOT STRAIT IN ONE SUMMER SEASON
8565-290391-0027 WHILST THE REVELATION OBTAINED FROM THE LONG SOUGHT RECORDS WHICH WERE DISCOVERED BY LIEUTENANT HOBSON IS MOST SATISFACTORY TO THOSE WHO SPECULATED ON THE PROBABILITY OF FRANKLIN HAVING IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TRIED TO FORCE HIS WAY NORTHWARDS THROUGH WELLINGTON CHANNEL AS WE NOW LEARN HE DID
8565-290391-0028 AT THE SAME TIME THE PUBLIC SHOULD FULLY UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVE WHICH PROMPTED THE SUPPORTERS OF LADY FRANKLIN IN ADVOCATING THE LAST SEARCH
8565-290391-0029 WE HAD EVERY REASON TO EXPECT THAT IF THE SHIPS WERE DISCOVERED THE SCIENTIFIC DOCUMENTS OF THE VOYAGE INCLUDING VALUABLE MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS WOULD BE RECOVERED
8565-290391-0030 THAT THE READER MAY COMPREHEND THE VAST EXTENT OF SEA TRAVERSED BY FRANKLIN IN THE TWO SUMMERS BEFORE HIS SHIPS WERE BESET
8565-290391-0031 THE DOTTED LINES AND ARROWS WHICH EXTEND FROM THE THEN KNOWN SEAS AND LANDS INTO THE UNKNOWN WATERS OR BLANK SPACES ON THIS OLD MAP INDICATE FRANKLIN'S ROUTE THE NOVELTY RANGE RAPIDITY AND BOLDNESS OF WHICH AS THUS DELINEATED MAY WELL SURPRISE THE GEOGRAPHER
8565-290391-0032 THOSE WHO HAVE NOT CLOSELY ATTENDED TO THE RESULTS OF OTHER ARCTIC VOYAGES MAY BE INFORMED THAT RARELY HAS AN EXPEDITION IN THE FIRST YEAR ACCOMPLISHED MORE BY ITS SHIPS THAN THE ESTABLISHING OF GOOD WINTER QUARTERS FROM WHENCE THE REAL RESEARCHES BEGAN BY SLEDGE WORK IN THE ENSUING SPRING
8565-290391-0033 FRANKLIN HOWEVER NOT ONLY REACHED BEECHEY ISLAND BUT ASCENDED WELLINGTON CHANNEL
8565-290391-0034 AND MUCH TO THE NORTH OF THE POINTS REACHED BY PENNY AND DE HAVEN
8565-290391-0035 WHICH HE THUS PROVED TO BE AN ISLAND THE LAST DISCOVERY OF A NAVIGABLE CHANNEL THROUGHOUT BETWEEN CORNWALLIS AND BATHURST ISLANDS THOUGH MADE IN THE VERY SUMMER HE LEFT ENGLAND HAS REMAINED EVEN TO THIS DAY UNKNOWN TO OTHER NAVIGATORS
8565-290391-0036 AFTER HIS COMPANION THE BRAVE LIEUTENANT BELLOT AND WHICH HAS HITHERTO BEEN REGARDED ONLY AS AN IMPASSABLE FROZEN CHANNEL OR IGNORED AS A CHANNEL AT ALL IS A NAVIGABLE STRAIT THE SOUTH SHORE OF WHICH IS THUS SEEN TO BE THE NORTHERNMOST LAND OF THE CONTINENT OF AMERICA
8565-290391-0037 M'CLINTOCK HAS ALSO LAID DOWN THE HITHERTO UNKNOWN COAST LINE OF BOOTHIA
8565-290391-0038 HAS DELINEATED THE WHOLE OF KING WILLIAM'S ISLAND AND OPENED A NEW AND CAPACIOUS THOUGH ICE CHOKED CHANNEL SUSPECTED BEFORE BUT NOT PROVED TO EXIST EXTENDING FROM VICTORIA STRAIT IN A NORTH WEST DIRECTION TO MELVILLE OR PARRY SOUND
8565-290391-0039 THE LATTER DISCOVERY REWARDED THE INDIVIDUAL EXERTIONS OF CAPTAIN ALLEN YOUNG BUT WILL VERY PROPERLY AT LADY FRANKLIN'S REQUEST BEAR THE NAME OF THE LEADER OF THE FOX EXPEDITION
8565-290391-0040 AS WELL AS OF THE LOWER ANIMALS THE MAN OF SCIENCE WILL HEREAFTER BE FURTHER GRATIFIED BY HAVING PRESENTED TO HIM
8565-290391-0041 BOTANY METEOROLOGY AND ESPECIALLY TO THE TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM OF THE REGION EXAMINED LASTLY M'CLINTOCK HAS CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT THE BEST WAY OF SECURING THE PASSAGE OF A SHIP FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE PACIFIC IS BY FOLLOWING AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE THE COAST LINE OF NORTH AMERICA
8565-290391-0042 FOUNDED UPON A LARGE EXPERIENCE THAT NO PASSAGE BY A SHIP CAN EVER BE ACCOMPLISHED IN A MORE NORTHERN DIRECTION THIS IT IS WELL KNOWN WAS THE FAVORITE THEORY OF FRANKLIN WHO HAD HIMSELF ALONG WITH RICHARDSON BACK BEECHEY DEASE SIMPSON AND RAE
8565-290391-0043 SURVEYED THE WHOLE OF THAT SAME NORTH AMERICAN COAST FROM THE BACK OR GREAT FISH RIVER TO BEHRING STRAIT THUS WHEN FRANKLIN SAILED IN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE
8565-290391-0044 AND THE DISCOVERIES OF PARRY WHO HAD ALREADY TO HIS GREAT RENOWN OPENED THE FIRST HALF OF A MORE NORTHERN COURSE FROM EAST TO WEST WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED BY THE IMPENETRABLE ICE BARRIER AT MELVILLE ISLAND
8565-290391-0045 AND HERE IT IS TO BE REMEMBERED THAT THE TRACT IN WHICH THE RECORD AND THE RELICS HAVE BEEN FOUND IS JUST THAT TO WHICH LADY FRANKLIN HERSELF SPECIALLY DIRECTED KENNEDY THE COMMANDER OF THE PRINCE ALBERT IN HER SECOND PRIVATE EXPEDITION IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO
8565-290391-0046 AND HAD THAT INTREPID EXPLORER NOT BEEN INDUCED TO SEARCH NORTHWARDS OF BELLOT STRAIT BUT HAD FELT HIMSELF ABLE TO FOLLOW THE COURSE INDICATED BY HIS SAGACIOUS EMPLOYER
8565-290391-0047 THE NATURAL MODESTY OF THIS COMMANDER HAS I AM BOUND TO SAY PREVENTED HIS DOING COMMON JUSTICE IN THE FOLLOWING JOURNAL TO HIS OWN CONDUCT CONDUCT WHICH CAN BE ESTIMATED BY THOSE ONLY WHO HAVE LISTENED TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE OFFICERS SERVING WITH AND UNDER THE MAN
8565-290391-0048 AND ENSURED THEIR PERFECT CONFIDENCE
8565-290391-0049 IN WRITING THIS PREFACE WHICH I DO AT THE REQUEST OF THE PROMOTERS OF THE LAST SEARCH I MAY STATE THAT HAVING OCCUPIED THE CHAIR OF THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY IN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE WHEN MY CHERISHED FRIEND SIR JOHN FRANKLIN WENT FORTH FOR THE THIRD TIME TO SEEK A NORTH WEST PASSAGE IT BECAME MY BOUNDEN DUTY IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS WHEN HIS ABSENCE CREATED MUCH ANXIETY
8565-290391-0050 ARDENTLY TO PROMOTE THE EMPLOYMENT OF SEARCHING EXPEDITIONS AND WARMLY TO SUSTAIN LADY FRANKLIN'S ENDEAVORS IN THIS HOLY CAUSE
8565-290391-0051 WHOSE LABORS TO SUPPORT AND CARRY OUT THIS LAST SEARCH HAVE BEEN SIGNALLY SERVICEABLE FORWARDED TO ME A TELEGRAM TO BE COMMUNICATED TO THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION AT ABERDEEN ANNOUNCING THE SUCCESS OF M'CLINTOCK THAT DOCUMENT REACHED BALMORAL ON THE TWENTY SECOND OF SEPTEMBER LAST
8565-290391-0052 WHEN THE MEN OF SCIENCE WERE INVITED THITHER BY THEIR SOVEREIGN GREAT WAS THE SATISFACTION CAUSED BY THE DIFFUSION OF THESE GOOD TIDINGS AMONG MY ASSOCIATES THE DISTINGUISHED ARCTIC EXPLORERS ADMIRAL SIR JAMES ROSS AND GENERAL SABINE BEING PRESENT
8565-290391-0053 THE IMMEDIATE BESTOWAL OF THE ARCTIC MEDAL UPON ALL THE OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE FOX IS A PLEASING PROOF THAT THIS INTEREST IS WELL SUSTAINED BUT THESE FEW INTRODUCTORY SENTENCES MUST NOT BE EXTENDED AND I INVITE THE READER AT ONCE TO PERUSE THE JOURNAL OF M'CLINTOCK
8565-290391-0054 WHICH WILL GRATIFY EVERY LOVER OF TRUTHFUL AND ARDENT RESEARCH THOUGH IT WILL LEAVE HIM IMPRESSED WITH THE SAD BELIEF
8565-290391-0055 WHO SAW THESE NOBLE FELLOWS FALL DOWN AND DIE AS THEY WALKED ALONG THE ICE LOOKING TO THE FACT THAT LITTLE OR NO FRESH FOOD COULD HAVE BEEN OBTAINED BY THE CREWS OF THE EREBUS AND TERROR DURING THEIR LONG IMPRISONMENT OF TWENTY MONTHS IN SO FRIGHTFULLY STERILE A REGION AS THAT IN WHICH THE SHIPS WERE ABANDONED
8565-290391-0056 SO STERILE THAT IT IS EVEN DESERTED BY THE ESQUIMAUX AND ALSO TO THE WANT OF SUSTENANCE IN SPRING AT THE MOUTH OF THE BACK RIVER
8565-290391-0057 PAINFUL AS IS THE REALISATION OF THIS TRAGIC EVENT LET US NOW DWELL ONLY ON THE REFLECTION THAT WHILE THE NORTH WEST PASSAGE HAS BEEN SOLVED BY THE HEROIC SELF SACRIFICE OF FRANKLIN CROZIER FITZJAMES AND THEIR ASSOCIATES
8565-290391-0058 THE SEARCHES AFTER THEM WHICH ARE NOW TERMINATED HAVE AT A VERY SMALL LOSS OF LIFE NOT ONLY ADDED PRODIGIOUSLY TO GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE BUT HAVE IN TIMES OF PEACE BEEN THE BEST SCHOOL FOR TESTING BY THE SEVEREST TRIALS THE SKILL AND ENDURANCE OF MANY A BRAVE SEAMAN
