6006-60489-0000 CATS LIKE MANY OTHER ANIMALS BOTH WILD AND DOMESTIC ARE SUBJECT TO DISEASES SEVERAL BEING FATAL OTHERS YIELDING TO KNOWN CURATIVES
6006-60489-0001 SOME ARE EPIDEMIC OTHERS ARE UNDOUBTEDLY CONTAGIOUS THE TWO WORST OF THESE ARE WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE DISTEMPER AND THE MANGE THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF FRIENDS I AM ENABLED TO GIVE RECIPES FOR MEDICINES CONSIDERED AS USEFUL OR AT ANY RATE
6006-60489-0002 TENDING TO ABATE THE SEVERITY OF THE ATTACK IN THE ONE AND UTTERLY ERADICATE THE OTHER CARE SHOULD ALWAYS BE TAKEN ON THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF ILLNESS TO REMOVE THE ANIMAL AT ONCE FROM CONTACT WITH OTHERS
6006-60489-0003 C B PRINCIPAL VETERINARY SURGEON OF THE ARMY HAS COURTEOUSLY SENT ME A COPY OF A REMEDY FOR CAT DISTEMPER FROM HIS VERY EXCELLENT WORK ANIMAL PLAGUES THEIR HISTORY NATURE AND PREVENTION WHICH I GIVE IN FULL CATARRHAL FEVERS
6006-60489-0004 CATS ARE LIKE SOME OTHER OF THE DOMESTICATED ANIMALS LIABLE TO BE ATTACKED BY TWO KINDS OF CATARRHAL FEVER ONE OF WHICH IS UNDOUBTEDLY VERY INFECTIOUS LIKE DISTEMPER IN DOGS AND THE OTHER MAY BE LOOKED UPON AS THE RESULT OF A SIMPLE COLD
6006-60489-0005 AND THEREFORE NOT TRANSMISSIBLE THE FIRST IS OF COURSE THE MOST SEVERE AND FATAL AND OFTEN PREVAILS MOST EXTENSIVELY AFFECTING CATS GENERALLY OVER WIDE AREAS SOMETIMES ENTIRE CONTINENTS BEING INVADED BY IT
6006-60489-0006 AND IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR WHEN IT HAD SPREAD OVER EUROPE AND EXTENDED TO AMERICA IN EIGHTEEN O THREE IT AGAIN APPEARED IN THIS COUNTRY AND OVER A LARGE PART OF THE EUROPEAN CONTINENT THE SYMPTOMS ARE INTENSE FEVER PROSTRATION VOMITING DIARRHOEA
6006-60489-0007 SNEEZING COUGH AND PROFUSE DISCHARGE FROM THE NOSE AND EYES SOMETIMES THE PAROTID GLANDS ARE SWOLLEN AS IN HUMAN MUMPS DOCTOR DARWIN OF DERBY UNCLE TO CHARLES DARWIN THOUGHT IT WAS A KIND OF MUMPS AND THEREFORE DESIGNATED IT PAROTITIS FELINA
6006-60489-0008 THE TREATMENT CONSISTS IN CAREFUL NURSING AND CLEANLINESS KEEPING THE ANIMAL MODERATELY WARM AND COMFORTABLE THE DISEASE RAPIDLY PRODUCES INTENSE DEBILITY AND THEREFORE THE STRENGTH SHOULD BE MAINTAINED FROM THE VERY COMMENCEMENT BY FREQUENT SMALL DOSES OF STRONG BEEF TEA
6006-60489-0009 INTO WHICH ONE GRAIN OF QUININE HAS BEEN INTRODUCED TWICE A DAY A SMALL QUANTITY OF PORT WINE FROM HALF TO ONE TEASPOONFUL ACCORDING TO THE SIZE OF THE CAT AND THE STATE OF DEBILITY IF THERE IS NO DIARRHOEA BUT CONSTIPATION
6006-60489-0010 A SMALL DOSE OF CASTOR OIL OR SYRUP OF BUCKTHORN SHOULD BE GIVEN SOLID FOOD SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED UNTIL CONVALESCENCE HAS SET IN
6006-60489-0011 WARMTH CLEANLINESS BROTH AND BEEF TEA ARE THE CHIEF ITEMS OF TREATMENT WITH A DOSE OF CASTOR OIL IF CONSTIPATION IS PRESENT IF THE DISCHARGE OBSTRUCTS THE NOSTRILS IT SHOULD BE REMOVED WITH A SPONGE AND THESE AND THE EYES MAY BE BATHED WITH A WEAK LOTION OF VINEGAR AND WATER
6006-60489-0012 AS REGARDS INOCULATION FOR DISTEMPER DOCTOR FLEMING SAYS IT HAS BEEN TRIED BUT THE REMEDY IS OFTEN WORSE THAN THE DISEASE AT LEAST AS BAD AS THE NATURAL DISEASE VACCINATION HAS ALSO BEEN TRIED BUT IT IS VALUELESS PROBABLY INOCULATION WITH
6006-60489-0013 CULTIVATED OR MODIFIED VIRUS WOULD BE FOUND A GOOD AND SAFE PREVENTATIVE I WAS ANXIOUS TO KNOW ABOUT THIS AS INOCULATION USED TO BE THE PRACTICE WITH PACKS OF HOUNDS IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT DOCTOR FLEMING TREATS THE DISTEMPER AS A KIND OF INFLUENZA
6006-60489-0014 AS A LAST RESOURCE TO AROUSE SINKING VITALITY
6006-60489-0015 IT MIGHT BE ADMINISTERED IN MILK OR GIVEN IN A SMALL PIECE OF BEEF OR MEAT OF ANY KIND AFTER THE COURSE GIVE AN APERIENT POWDER MANGE THE BEST POSSIBLE REMEDIES FOR THIS DISEASE ARE ARSENICUM TWO X TRITURATION
6006-60489-0016 AND SULPHUR TWO X TRITURATION GIVEN ON ALTERNATE DAYS AS MUCH AS WILL LIE ON A THREEPENNY PIECE NIGHT AND MORNING ADMINISTERED AS ABOVE A MOST USEFUL LOTION IS ACID SULPHUROUS
6006-60489-0017 ADDING ABOUT A TEASPOONFUL OF GLYCERINE AND SPONGING THE AFFECTED PARTS TWICE OR THRICE DAILY COLDS THE SYMPTOMS ARE TWOFOLD USUALLY THERE IS CONSTANT SNEEZING AND DISCHARGE FROM THE NOSE ACONITE ONE X TINCTURE
6006-60489-0018 ONE DROP GIVEN EVERY THREE HOURS IN ALTERNATION WITH ARSENICUM THREE X TRITURATION WILL SPEEDILY REMOVE THE DISEASE SHOULD THERE BE STUFFING OF THE NOSE AND DIFFICULT BREATHING GIVE MERCURIUS BINIOD THREE X TRITURATION A DOSE EVERY THREE OR FOUR HOURS
6006-60489-0019 ANTIMONIUM TARTARIC TWO X GRAINS IIJ EVERY TWO THREE OR FOUR HOURS ACCORDING TO THE SEVERITY OF THE SYMPTOMS DISTEMPER EARLY SYMPTOMS SHOULD BE NOTED AND RECEIVE PROMPT ATTENTION THIS WILL OFTEN CUT SHORT THE DURATION OF THE MALADY
6006-60489-0020 SEEKING A DARK CORNER BENEATH A SOFA ET CETERA THE EYES FLOW FREELY THE NOSE AFTER BECOMING HARD AND DRY BECOMES STOPPED WITH FLUID THE TONGUE PARCHED AND TOTAL AVERSION TO FOOD FOLLOWS
6006-60489-0021 AND THE ANIMAL CREEPS AWAY INTO SOME QUIET CORNER TO DIE IF BEFORE THIS ITS LIFE HAS NOT BEEN MERCIFULLY ENDED ON DISCOVERY OF FIRST SYMPTOMS GIVE TWO DROPS ACONITE AND ARSENICUM IN ALTERNATION EVERY THREE HOURS
6006-60489-0022 WHEN THE NOSE BECOMES DRY AND THE EYE RESTLESS AND GLARING GIVE BELLADONNA CANKER OF EAR WHEN INTERNAL DROP INTO THE AFFECTED EAR NIGHT AND MORNING THREE OR FIVE DROPS OF THE FOLLOWING MIXTURE
6006-60489-0023 TINCTURE OF HYDRASTIS CANADENSIS TWO DRACHMS CARBOLIC ACID PURE
6006-60489-0024 IF EXTERNAL PAINT WITH THE MIXTURE THE AFFECTED PARTS APERIENT GET A CHEMIST TO RUB DOWN A MEDIUM SIZE CROTON BEAN WITH ABOUT FORTY GRAINS OF SUGAR OF MILK AND DIVIDE INTO FOUR POWDERS
6006-60489-0025 ONE OF THESE POWDERS GIVEN IN MILK USUALLY SUFFICES LARGE CATS OFTEN REQUIRE TWO POWDERS THE DOSE MIGHT BE REPEATED IF NECESSARY DOSE WHEN DROPS ARE ORDERED TWO DROPS
6006-60489-0026 REMEDIES AND STRENGTHENING MEDICINES ACONITE ONE X TINCTURE ARSENICUM TWO X TRITURATION ANTIMONIUM TARTARICUM TWO X TRITURATION BELLADONNA
6006-60489-0027 THREE X TRITURATION MERCURIUS BINIODATUS THREE X TRITURATION HYDRASTIS CANADENSIS GREEK PHI TINCTURE SULPHUR TWO X TRITURATION
6006-60489-0028 THAT THEY MAY SELECT WHICH REMEDY THEY DEEM BEST DISTEMPER TAKE YELLOW BASILICON
6006-60489-0029 OIL OF JUNIPER THREE DRACHMS MIX FOR OINTMENT
6006-60489-0030 TWO OR THREE TIMES ON ALTERNATE NIGHTS PURGATIVE NOTHING LIKE CASTOR OIL FOR PURGATION HALF THE QUANTITY OF SYRUP OF BUCKTHORN IF NECESSARY MAY BE ADDED WORMS
6006-60489-0031 COLD IN THE EYES AND SNEEZING MAY BE RELIEVED BY SWEET SPIRITS OF NITRE
6006-60489-0032 WELL MIXED FOR A LOTION AND APPLY NIGHT AND MORNING EYE OINTMENT RED OXIDE OF MERCURY TWELVE GRAINS
6006-60489-0033 THE ABOVE PRESCRIPTION WAS GIVEN TO ME MANY YEARS AGO BY THE LATE DOCTOR WALSH STONEHENGE AND I HAVE FOUND IT OF GREAT SERVICE BOTH FOR MY OWN EYES ALSO THOSE OF ANIMALS AND BIRDS WASH THE EYES CAREFULLY WITH WARM WATER DRY OFF WITH A SOFT SILK HANDKERCHIEF
6006-60489-0034 AND APPLY A LITTLE OF THE OINTMENT DOCTOR WALSH INFORMED ME THAT HE DEEMED IT EXCELLENT FOR CANKER IN THE EAR BUT OF THAT I HAVE HAD NO EXPERIENCE FOR MANGE
6006-60489-0035 IN THE EARLY STAGES OF MANGE FLOWERS OF SULPHUR MIXED IN VASELINE AND RUBBED IN THE COAT OF THE CAT IS EFFICACIOUS GIVING SULPHUR IN THE MILK THE WATER AND ON THE FOOD OF THE PATIENT ALSO GIVE VEGETABLE DIET ANOTHER REMEDY GIVE A TEASPOONFUL OF CASTOR OIL
6006-60489-0036 NEXT DAY GIVE RAW MEAT DUSTED OVER WITH FLOWERS OF SULPHUR ALSO GIVE SULPHUR IN MILK IF THERE ARE ANY SORE PLACES BATHE WITH LOTION MADE FROM CAMPHORATED OIL IN WHICH SOME SULPHUR IS MIXED
6006-60489-0037 CAMPHOR ONE QUARTER OZ SULPHUR A TEASPOONFUL AS A RULE WHEN THE ANIMAL IS OF VALUE EITHER INTRINSICALLY OR AS A PET THE BEST PLAN IS TO CONSULT A PRACTITIONER WELL VERSED IN THE VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ART
6006-60489-0038 ESPECIALLY WHEN THE CAT APPEARS TO SUFFER FROM SOME OBSCURE DISEASE MANY OF WHICH IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DETECT UNLESS BY THE TRAINED AND PRACTISED EYE OF ALL THE AILMENTS BOTH OF DOGS AND CATS DISTEMPER IS THE WORST TO COMBAT AND IS SO VIRULENT AND CONTAGIOUS
6006-60489-0039 THAT I HAVE THOUGHT IT WELL TO OFFER REMEDIES THAT ARE AT LEAST WORTHY OF A TRIAL THOUGH WHEN THE COMPLAINT HAS FIRM HOLD AND THE ATTACK VERY SEVERE THE CASE IS GENERALLY ALMOST HOPELESS ESPECIALLY WITH HIGH BRED ANIMALS POISON
6006-60489-0040 IT IS NOT GENERALLY KNOWN THAT THE MUCH ADMIRED LABURNUM CONTAINS A STRONG POISON AND IS THEREFORE AN EXCEEDINGLY DANGEROUS PLANT ALL ITS PARTS BLOSSOMS LEAVES SEEDS EVEN THE BARK AND THE ROOTS
6006-60489-0041 AS FEW WOULD SUSPECT THE CAUSE TO COME FROM THE LOVELY PLANT THAT SO DELIGHTS THE EYE IT HAS HOWEVER LONG BEEN KNOWN TO GAMEKEEPERS AND OTHERS AND USED BY THEM TO DESTROY VERMIN
