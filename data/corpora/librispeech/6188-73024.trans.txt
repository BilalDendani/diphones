6188-73024-0000 AND HE HAD NOT AGAIN SEEN LADY ONGAR HE HAD PROFESSED TO HIMSELF THAT HIS REASON FOR NOT GOING THERE WAS THE NON PERFORMANCE OF THE COMMISSION WHICH LADY ONGAR HAD GIVEN HIM WITH REFERENCE TO COUNT PATEROFF HE HAD NOT YET SUCCEEDED IN CATCHING THE COUNT
6188-73024-0001 THOUGH HE HAD TWICE ASKED FOR HIM IN MOUNT STREET AND TWICE AT THE CLUB IN PALL MALL IT APPEARED THAT THE COUNT NEVER WENT TO MOUNT STREET AND WAS VERY RARELY SEEN AT THE CLUB THERE WAS SOME OTHER CLUB WHICH HE FREQUENTED AND HARRY DID NOT KNOW WHAT CLUB
6188-73024-0002 ON BOTH THE OCCASIONS OF HARRY'S CALLING IN MOUNT STREET THE SERVANT HAD ASKED HIM TO GO UP AND SEE MADAME BUT HE HAD DECLINED TO DO SO PLEADING THAT HE WAS HURRIED HE WAS HOWEVER DRIVEN TO RESOLVE THAT HE MUST GO DIRECT TO SOPHIE
6188-73024-0003 AS OTHERWISE HE COULD FIND NO MEANS OF DOING AS HE HAD PROMISED SHE PROBABLY MIGHT PUT HIM ON THE SCENT OF HER BROTHER BUT THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER REASON WHY HARRY HAD NOT GONE TO BOLTON STREET THOUGH HE HAD NOT ACKNOWLEDGED IT TO HIMSELF
6188-73024-0004 HE FEARED THAT HE WOULD BE LED ON TO BETRAY HIMSELF AND TO BETRAY FLORENCE TO THROW HIMSELF AT JULIA'S FEET AND SACRIFICE HIS HONESTY IN SPITE OF ALL HIS RESOLUTIONS TO THE CONTRARY
6188-73024-0005 HE FELT WHEN THERE AS THE ACCUSTOMED BUT REPENTANT DRAM DRINKER MIGHT FEEL WHEN HAVING RESOLVED TO ABSTAIN HE IS CALLED UPON TO SIT WITH THE FULL GLASS OFFERED BEFORE HIS LIPS
6188-73024-0006 BUT THOUGH HE DID NOT GO AFTER THE FIRE WATER OF BOLTON STREET NEITHER WAS HE ABLE TO SATISFY HIMSELF WITH THE COOL FOUNTAIN OF ONSLOW CRESCENT HE WAS WRETCHED AT THIS TIME ILL SATISFIED WITH HIMSELF AND OTHERS
6188-73024-0007 AND WAS NO FITTING COMPANION FOR CECILIA BURTON THE WORLD HE THOUGHT HAD USED HIM ILL HE COULD HAVE BEEN TRUE TO JULIA BRABAZON WHEN SHE WAS WELL NIGH PENNILESS IT WAS NOT FOR HER MONEY THAT HE HAD REGARDED HER
6188-73024-0008 HAD HE BEEN NOW A FREE MAN FREE FROM THOSE CHAINS WITH WHICH HE HAD FETTERED HIMSELF AT STRATTON HE WOULD AGAIN HAVE ASKED THIS WOMAN FOR HER LOVE IN SPITE OF HER PAST TREACHERY BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR HER LOVE
6188-73024-0009 AND NOT FOR HER MONEY THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOUGHT HER WAS IT HIS FAULT THAT HE HAD LOVED HER THAT SHE HAD BEEN FALSE TO HIM AND THAT SHE HAD NOW COME BACK AND THROWN HERSELF BEFORE HIM
6188-73024-0010 OR HAD HE BEEN WRONG BECAUSE HE HAD VENTURED TO THINK THAT HE LOVED ANOTHER WHEN JULIA HAD DESERTED HIM OR COULD HE HELP HIMSELF IF HE NOW FOUND THAT HIS LOVE IN TRUTH BELONGED TO HER WHOM HE HAD KNOWN FIRST
6188-73024-0011 THE WORLD HAD BEEN VERY CRUEL TO HIM AND HE COULD NOT GO TO ONSLOW CRESCENT AND BEHAVE THERE PRETTILY HEARING THE PRAISES OF FLORENCE WITH ALL THE ARDOR OF A DISCREET LOVER HE KNEW WELL WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS RIGHT COURSE
6188-73024-0012 AND YET HE DID NOT FOLLOW IT LET HIM BUT ONCE COMMUNICATE TO LADY ONGAR THE FACT OF HIS ENGAGEMENT AND THE DANGER WOULD BE OVER THOUGH MUCH PERHAPS OF THE MISERY MIGHT REMAIN LET HIM WRITE TO HER AND MENTION THE FACT
6188-73024-0013 BRINGING IT UP AS SOME LITTLE IMMATERIAL ACCIDENT AND SHE WOULD UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANT BUT THIS HE ABSTAINED FROM DOING THOUGH HE SWORE TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT TOUCH THE DRAM HE WOULD NOT DASH DOWN THE FULL GLASS THAT WAS HELD TO HIS LIPS
6188-73024-0014 HE WENT ABOUT THE TOWN VERY WRETCHEDLY LOOKING FOR THE COUNT AND REGARDING HIMSELF AS A MAN SPECIALLY MARKED OUT FOR SORROW BY THE CRUEL HAND OF MISFORTUNE LADY ONGAR IN THE MEANTIME WAS EXPECTING HIM
6188-73024-0015 AND WAS WAXING ANGRY AND BECOMING BITTER TOWARD HIM BECAUSE HE CAME NOT SIR HUGH CLAVERING WAS NOW IN LONDON AND WITH HIM WAS HIS BROTHER ARCHIE SIR HUGH WAS A MAN WHO STRAINED AN INCOME THAT WAS HANDSOME AND SUFFICIENT FOR A COUNTRY GENTLEMAN
6188-73024-0016 TO THE VERY UTMOST WANTING TO GET OUT OF IT MORE THAN IT COULD BE MADE TO GIVE HE WAS NOT A MAN TO BE IN DEBT OR INDULGE HIMSELF WITH PRESENT PLEASURES TO BE PAID FOR OUT OF THE FUNDS OF FUTURE YEARS
6188-73024-0017 HE WAS POSSESSED OF A WORLDLY WISDOM WHICH KEPT HIM FROM THAT FOLLY AND TAUGHT HIM TO APPRECIATE FULLY THE VALUE OF INDEPENDENCE BUT HE WAS EVER REMEMBERING HOW MANY SHILLINGS THERE ARE IN A POUND AND HOW MANY PENCE IN A SHILLING
6188-73024-0018 HE HAD A GREAT EYE TO DISCOUNT AND LOOKED CLOSELY INTO HIS BILLS HE SEARCHED FOR CHEAP SHOPS AND SOME MEN BEGAN TO SAY OF HIM THAT HE HAD FOUND A CHEAP ESTABLISHMENT FOR SUCH WINES AS HE DID NOT DRINK HIMSELF
6188-73024-0019 IN PLAYING CARDS AND IN BETTING HE WAS VERY CAREFUL NEVER PLAYING HIGH NEVER RISKING MUCH BUT HOPING TO TURN SOMETHING BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND ANGRY WITH HIMSELF IF HE HAD NOT DONE SO
6188-73024-0020 AN UNAMIABLE MAN HE WAS BUT ONE WHOSE HEIR WOULD PROBABLY NOT QUARREL WITH HIM IF ONLY HE WOULD DIE SOON ENOUGH HE HAD ALWAYS HAD A HOUSE IN TOWN A MODERATE HOUSE IN BERKELEY SQUARE WHICH BELONGED TO HIM
6188-73024-0021 AND HAD BELONGED TO HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM LADY CLAVERING HAD USUALLY LIVED THERE DURING THE SEASON OR AS HAD LATTERLY BEEN THE CASE DURING ONLY A PART OF THE SEASON AND NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS IN THIS YEAR
6188-73024-0022 THAT LADY CLAVERING WAS NOT TO COME TO LONDON AT ALL AND THAT SIR HUGH WAS MEDITATING WHETHER THE HOUSE IN BERKELEY SQUARE MIGHT NOT BE LET THE ARRANGEMENT WOULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE OF CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN A THOUSAND A YEAR TO HIM
6188-73024-0023 FOR HIMSELF HE WOULD TAKE LODGINGS HE HAD NO IDEA OF GIVING UP LONDON IN THE SPRING AND EARLY SUMMER BUT WHY KEEP UP A HOUSE IN BERKELEY SQUARE AS LADY CLAVERING DID NOT USE IT
6188-73024-0024 HE WAS PARTLY DRIVEN TO THIS BY A DESIRE TO SHAKE OFF THE BURDEN OF HIS BROTHER WHEN ARCHIE CHOSE TO GO TO CLAVERING THE HOUSE WAS OPEN TO HIM THAT WAS THE NECESSITY OF SIR HUGH'S POSITION
6188-73024-0025 AND HE COULD NOT AVOID IT UNLESS HE MADE IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO QUARREL WITH HIS BROTHER ARCHIE WAS OBEDIENT RINGING THE BELL WHEN HE WAS TOLD LOOKING AFTER THE HORSES SPYING ABOUT AND PERHAPS SAVING AS MUCH MONEY AS HE COST
6188-73024-0026 BUT THE MATTER WAS VERY DIFFERENT IN BERKELEY SQUARE NO ELDER BROTHER IS BOUND TO FIND BREAKFAST AND BED FOR A YOUNGER BROTHER IN LONDON AND YET FROM HIS BOYHOOD UPWARD ARCHIE HAD MADE GOOD HIS FOOTING IN BERKELEY SQUARE
6188-73024-0027 IN THE MATTER OF THE BREAKFAST SIR HUGH HAD INDEED OF LATE GOT THE BETTER OF HIM THE SERVANTS WERE KEPT ON BOARD WAGES AND THERE WERE NO HOUSEHOLD ACCOUNTS BUT THERE WAS ARCHIE'S ROOM AND SIR HUGH FELT THIS TO BE A HARDSHIP
6188-73024-0028 THE PRESENT WAS NOT THE MOMENT FOR ACTUALLY DRIVING FORTH THE INTRUDER FOR ARCHIE WAS NOW UP IN LONDON ESPECIALLY UNDER HIS BROTHER'S AUSPICES AND IF THE BUSINESS ON WHICH CAPTAIN CLAVERING WAS NOW INTENT COULD BE BROUGHT TO A SUCCESSFUL ISSUE
6188-73024-0029 THE STANDING IN THE WORLD OF THAT YOUNG MAN WOULD BE VERY MUCH ALTERED THEN HE WOULD BE A BROTHER OF WHOM SIR HUGH MIGHT BE PROUD A BROTHER WHO WOULD PAY HIS WAY AND SETTLE HIS POINTS AT WHIST IF HE LOST THEM EVEN TO A BROTHER
6188-73024-0030 IF ARCHIE COULD INDUCE LADY ONGAR TO MARRY HIM HE WOULD NOT BE CALLED UPON ANY LONGER TO RING THE BELLS AND LOOK AFTER THE STABLE HE WOULD HAVE BELLS OF HIS OWN AND STABLES TOO AND PERHAPS SOME CAPTAIN OF HIS OWN TO RING THEM AND LOOK AFTER THEM
6188-73024-0031 BUT SIR HUGH WOULD ADMIT OF NO DELAY WHEREAS ARCHIE HIMSELF SEEMED TO THINK THAT THE IRON WAS NOT YET QUITE HOT ENOUGH FOR STRIKING IT WOULD BE BETTER HE HAD SUGGESTED TO POSTPONE THE WORK TILL JULIA COULD BE COAXED DOWN TO CLAVERING IN THE AUTUMN
6188-73024-0032 HE COULD DO THE WORK BETTER HE THOUGHT DOWN AT CLAVERING THAN IN LONDON BUT SIR HUGH WAS ALTOGETHER OF A DIFFERENT OPINION THOUGH HE HAD ALREADY ASKED HIS SISTER IN LAW TO CLAVERING WHEN THE IDEA HAD FIRST COME UP
6188-73024-0033 HE WAS GLAD THAT SHE HAD DECLINED THE VISIT HER COMING MIGHT BE VERY WELL IF SHE ACCEPTED ARCHIE BUT HE DID NOT WANT TO BE TROUBLED WITH ANY RENEWAL OF HIS RESPONSIBILITY RESPECTING HER IF AS WAS MORE PROBABLE SHE SHOULD REJECT HIM
6188-73024-0034 THE WORLD STILL LOOKED ASKANCE AT LADY ONGAR AND HUGH DID NOT WISH TO TAKE UP THE ARMOR OF A PALADIN IN HER FAVOR IF ARCHIE MARRIED HER ARCHIE WOULD BE THE PALADIN THOUGH INDEED IN THAT CASE NO PALADIN WOULD BE NEEDED
6188-73024-0035 SHE HAS ONLY BEEN A WIDOW YOU KNOW FOUR MONTHS SAID ARCHIE PLEADING FOR DELAY IT WON'T BE DELICATE WILL IT DELICATE SAID SIR HUGH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE IS MUCH OF DELICACY IN IT AT ALL
6188-73024-0036 I DON'T SEE WHY SHE ISN'T TO BE TREATED LIKE ANY OTHER WOMAN IF YOU WERE TO DIE YOU'D THINK IT VERY ODD IF ANY FELLOW CAME UP TO HERMY BEFORE THE SEASON WAS OVER ARCHIE YOU ARE A FOOL SAID SIR HUGH
6188-73024-0037 AND ARCHIE COULD SEE BY HIS BROTHER'S BROW THAT HUGH WAS ANGRY YOU SAY THINGS THAT FOR FOLLY AND ABSURDITY ARE BEYOND BELIEF IF YOU CAN'T SEE THE PECULIARITIES OF JULIA'S POSITION I AM NOT GOING TO POINT THEM OUT TO YOU
6188-73024-0038 SHE IS PECULIAR OF COURSE HAVING SO MUCH MONEY AND THAT PLACE NEAR GUILFORD ALL HER OWN FOR HER LIFE OF COURSE IT'S PECULIAR BUT FOUR MONTHS HUGH IF IT HAD BEEN FOUR DAYS IT NEED HAVE MADE NO DIFFERENCE
6188-73024-0039 A HOME WITH SOME ONE TO SUPPORT HER IS EVERYTHING TO HER IF YOU WAIT TILL LOTS OF FELLOWS ARE BUZZING AROUND HER YOU WON'T HAVE A CHANCE YOU'LL FIND THAT BY THIS TIME NEXT YEAR SHE'LL BE THE TOP OF THE FASHION AND IF NOT ENGAGED TO YOU SHE WILL BE TO SOME ONE ELSE
6188-73024-0040 I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HARRY WERE AFTER HER AGAIN HE'S ENGAGED TO THAT GIRL WE SAW DOWN AT CLAVERING WHAT OF THAT ENGAGEMENTS CAN BE BROKEN AS WELL AS MADE YOU HAVE THIS GREAT ADVANTAGE OVER EVERY ONE EXCEPT HIM
6188-73024-0041 THAT YOU CAN GO TO HER AT ONCE WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING OUT OF THE WAY THAT GIRL THAT HARRY HAS IN TOW MAY PERHAPS KEEP HIM AWAY FOR SOME TIME I TELL YOU WHAT HUGH YOU MIGHT AS WELL CALL WITH ME THE FIRST TIME
6188-73024-0042 SO THAT I MAY QUARREL WITH HER WHICH I CERTAINLY SHOULD DO OR RATHER SHE WITH ME NO ARCHIE IF YOU'RE AFRAID TO GO ALONE YOU'D BETTER GIVE IT UP AFRAID I'M NOT AFRAID SHE CAN'T EAT YOU
6188-73024-0043 REMEMBER THAT WITH HER YOU NEEDN'T STAND ON YOUR P'S AND Q'S AS YOU WOULD WITH ANOTHER WOMAN SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE IS ABOUT AND WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE HAS TO GET AS WELL AS WHAT SHE IS EXPECTED TO GIVE ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT IF SHE ACCEPTS YOU
6188-73024-0044 HERMY WILL CONSENT THAT SHE SHALL GO TO CLAVERING AS MUCH AS SHE PLEASES TILL THE MARRIAGE TAKES PLACE
6188-73024-0045 AND IN THAT CASE SHE SHALL BE MARRIED AT CLAVERING HERE WAS A PROSPECT FOR JULIA BRABAZON TO BE LED TO THE SAME ALTAR AT WHICH SHE HAD MARRIED LORD ONGAR BY ARCHIE CLAVERING TWELVE MONTH'S AFTER HER FIRST HUSBAND'S DEATH
6188-73024-0046 AND LITTLE MORE THAN TWO YEARS AFTER HER FIRST WEDDING THE PECULIARITY OF THE POSITION DID NOT QUITE MAKE ITSELF APPARENT EITHER TO HUGH OR TO ARCHIE BUT THERE WAS ONE POINT WHICH DID SUGGEST ITSELF TO THE YOUNGER BROTHER AT THAT MOMENT
6188-73024-0047 CAN'T SAY I'M SURE SAID SIR HUGH BECAUSE I SHOULDN'T LIKE IF I WERE YOU I WOULDN'T TROUBLE MYSELF ABOUT THAT JUDGE NOT THAT YOU BE NOT JUDGED
