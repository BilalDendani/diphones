5606-54666-0000 EVERYTHING WAS OPPRESSIVELY NEW THE BRILLIANTLY VARNISHED DOOR CRACKED WITH A REPORT LIKE A PISTOL WHEN IT WAS OPENED THE PAPER ON THE WALLS WITH ITS GAUDY PATTERN OF BIRDS TRELLIS WORK AND FLOWERS IN GOLD RED AND GREEN ON A WHITE GROUND LOOKED HARDLY DRY YET
5606-54666-0001 THE SHOWY WINDOW CURTAINS OF WHITE AND SKY BLUE AND THE STILL SHOWIER CARPET OF RED AND YELLOW SEEMED AS IF THEY HAD COME OUT OF THE SHOP YESTERDAY THE ROUND ROSEWOOD TABLE WAS IN A PAINFULLY HIGH STATE OF POLISH THE MOROCCO BOUND PICTURE BOOKS THAT LAY ON IT
5606-54666-0002 NOT ONE LEAF EVEN OF THE MUSIC ON THE PIANO WAS DOGS EARED OR WORN NEVER WAS A RICHLY FURNISHED ROOM MORE THOROUGHLY COMFORTLESS THAN THIS THE EYE ACHED AT LOOKING ROUND IT THERE WAS NO REPOSE ANYWHERE
5606-54666-0003 THE PRINT OF THE QUEEN HANGING LONELY ON THE WALL IN ITS HEAVY GILT FRAME WITH A LARGE CROWN AT THE TOP GLARED ON YOU THE PAPER THE CURTAINS THE CARPET GLARED ON YOU THE BOOKS THE WAX FLOWERS IN GLASS CASES
5606-54666-0004 ALL SURROUNDING OBJECTS SEEMED STARTLINGLY NEAR TO THE EYE MUCH NEARER THAN THEY REALLY WERE
5606-54666-0005 BEFORE HE HAD BEEN IN IT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR I WAS NOT KEPT WAITING LONG ANOTHER VIOLENT CRACK FROM THE NEW DOOR ANNOUNCED THE ENTRANCE OF MISTER SHERWIN HIMSELF HE WAS A TALL THIN MAN RATHER ROUND SHOULDERED
5606-54666-0006 WEAK AT THE KNEES AND TRYING TO CONCEAL THE WEAKNESS IN THE BREADTH OF HIS TROWSERS HE WORE A WHITE CRAVAT AND AN ABSURDLY HIGH SHIRT COLLAR HIS COMPLEXION WAS SALLOW HIS EYES WERE SMALL BLACK BRIGHT AND INCESSANTLY IN MOTION
5606-54666-0007 THE MOUTH AND THE MUSCLES OF THE CHEEK HIS HAIR HAD BEEN BLACK BUT WAS NOW TURNING TO A SORT OF IRON GREY
5606-54666-0008 AND PART OF IT PROJECTED ALMOST HORIZONTALLY OVER HIS FOREHEAD HE HAD A HABIT OF STRETCHING IT IN THIS DIRECTION BY IRRITABLY COMBING IT OUT FROM TIME TO TIME WITH HIS FINGERS HIS LIPS WERE THIN AND COLOURLESS
5606-54666-0009 A GREAT STICKLER FOR THE CONVENTIONAL RESPECTABILITIES OF LIFE AND A GREAT BELIEVER IN HIS OWN INFALLIBILITY BUT HE WAS MARGARET'S FATHER AND I WAS DETERMINED TO BE PLEASED WITH HIM HE MADE ME A LOW AND RATHER A CRINGING BOW
5606-54666-0010 THEN LOOKED TO THE WINDOW AND SEEING THE CARRIAGE WAITING FOR ME AT HIS DOOR MADE ANOTHER BOW AND INSISTED ON RELIEVING ME OF MY HAT WITH HIS OWN HAND THIS DONE HE COUGHED AND BEGGED TO KNOW WHAT HE COULD DO FOR ME
5606-54666-0011 I FELT SOME DIFFICULTY IN OPENING MY BUSINESS TO HIM IT WAS NECESSARY TO SPEAK HOWEVER AT ONCE I BEGAN WITH AN APOLOGY I AM AFRAID MISTER SHERWIN THAT THIS INTRUSION ON THE PART OF A PERFECT STRANGER
5606-54666-0012 NOT ENTIRELY A STRANGER SIR IF I MAY BE ALLOWED TO SAY SO INDEED I HAD THE GREAT PLEASURE SIR AND PROFIT AND
5606-54666-0013 VERY BEAUTIFUL HOUSE I HAPPEN TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE STEWARD OF YOUR RESPECTED FATHER HE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME TO WALK THROUGH THE ROOMS A TREAT QUITE AN INTELLECTUAL TREAT THE FURNITURE AND HANGINGS AND SO ON ARRANGED IN SUCH A CHASTE STYLE AND
5606-54666-0014 THE PICTURES SOME OF THE FINEST PIECES I EVER SAW I WAS DELIGHTED QUITE DELIGHTED INDEED HE SPOKE IN UNDER TONES LAYING GREAT STRESS UPON PARTICULAR WORDS THAT WERE EVIDENTLY FAVOURITES WITH HIM SUCH AS INDEED
5606-54666-0015 NOT ONLY HIS EYES BUT HIS WHOLE FACE SEEMED TO BE NERVOUSLY BLINKING AND WINKING ALL THE TIME HE WAS ADDRESSING ME IN THE EMBARRASSMENT AND ANXIETY WHICH I THEN FELT THIS PECULIARITY FIDGETTED AND BEWILDERED ME MORE THAN I CAN DESCRIBE
5606-54666-0016 I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE WORLD TO HAVE HAD HIS BACK TURNED BEFORE I SPOKE TO HIM AGAIN I AM DELIGHTED TO HEAR THAT MY FAMILY AND MY NAME ARE NOT UNKNOWN TO YOU MISTER SHERWIN I RESUMED
5606-54666-0017 UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES I SHALL FEEL LESS HESITATION AND DIFFICULTY IN MAKING YOU ACQUAINTED WITH THE OBJECT OF MY VISIT
5606-54666-0018 THANK YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE MISTER SHERWIN I HAVE REASONS FOR WISHING THAT THIS INTERVIEW
5606-54666-0019 MAY BE CONSIDERED STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL I AM SURE I CAN DEPEND ON YOUR FAVOURING ME THUS FAR CERTAINLY MOST CERTAINLY THE STRICTEST SECRECY OF COURSE PRAY GO ON HE DREW HIS CHAIR A LITTLE NEARER TO ME
5606-54666-0020 I MUST ALSO BEG YOU TO SUSPEND YOUR JUDGMENT UNTIL YOU HAVE HEARD ME TO THE END YOU MAY BE DISPOSED TO VIEW TO VIEW
5606-54666-0021 HE STOPPED HALF BREATHLESS BENDING FORWARD TOWARDS ME AND CRUMPLING MY CARD BETWEEN HIS FINGERS INTO THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE DIMENSIONS
5606-54666-0022 RATHER MORE THAN A WEEK AGO I CONTINUED I ACCIDENTALLY MET MISS SHERWIN IN AN OMNIBUS ACCOMPANIED BY A LADY OLDER THAN HERSELF MY WIFE MISSUS SHERWIN HE SAID IMPATIENTLY MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND
5606-54666-0023 AS IF MISSUS SHERWIN WERE SOME INSIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE TO THE CONVERSATION WHICH HE WISHED TO CLEAR OUT OF THE WAY AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
5606-54666-0024 THE IMPRESSION SHE MADE ON ME WAS SOMETHING MORE HOWEVER THAN A MERE MOMENTARY FEELING OF ADMIRATION
5606-54666-0025 YOU HAVE HEARD OF SUCH A THING AS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT MISTER SHERWIN IN BOOKS SIR HE TAPPED ONE OF THE MOROCCO BOUND VOLUMES ON THE TABLE AND SMILED A CURIOUS SMILE PARTLY DEFERENTIAL AND PARTLY SARCASTIC
5606-54666-0026 YOU WOULD BE INCLINED TO LAUGH I DARE SAY IF I ASKED YOU TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SUCH A THING AS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT OUT OF BOOKS BUT WITHOUT DWELLING FURTHER ON THAT IT IS MY DUTY TO CONFESS TO YOU
5606-54666-0027 IN ALL CANDOUR AND HONESTY THAT THE IMPRESSION MISS SHERWIN PRODUCED ON ME WAS SUCH AS TO MAKE ME DESIRE THE PRIVILEGE OF BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH HER IN PLAIN WORDS I DISCOVERED HER PLACE OF RESIDENCE BY FOLLOWING HER TO THIS HOUSE
5606-54666-0028 UPON MY SOUL THIS IS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY PROCEEDING PRAY HEAR ME OUT MISTER SHERWIN YOU WILL NOT CONDEMN MY CONDUCT I THINK IF YOU HEAR ALL I HAVE TO SAY HE MUTTERED SOMETHING UNINTELLIGIBLE
5606-54666-0029 HIS COMPLEXION TURNED YELLOWER HE DROPPED MY CARD WHICH HE HAD BY THIS TIME CRUSHED INTO FRAGMENTS AND RAN HIS HAND RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS HAIR UNTIL HE HAD STRETCHED IT OUT LIKE A PENTHOUSE OVER HIS FOREHEAD BLINKING ALL THE TIME AND REGARDING ME
5606-54666-0030 WITH A LOWERING SINISTER EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE I SAW THAT IT WAS USELESS TO TREAT HIM AS I SHOULD HAVE TREATED A GENTLEMAN HE HAD EVIDENTLY PUT THE MEANEST AND THE FOULEST CONSTRUCTION UPON MY DELICACY AND HESITATION IN SPEAKING TO HIM SO I ALTERED MY PLAN
5606-54666-0031 AND CAME TO THE POINT ABRUPTLY CAME TO BUSINESS AS HE WOULD HAVE CALLED IT I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN PLAINER MISTER SHERWIN I OUGHT PERHAPS TO HAVE TOLD YOU AT THE OUTSET IN SO MANY WORDS THAT I CAME TO
5606-54666-0032 I WAS ABOUT TO SAY TO ASK YOUR DAUGHTER'S HAND IN MARRIAGE BUT A THOUGHT OF MY FATHER MOVED DARKLY OVER MY MIND AT THAT MOMENT AND THE WORDS WOULD NOT PASS MY LIPS WELL SIR TO WHAT THE TONE IN WHICH HE SAID THIS WAS HARSH ENOUGH TO ROUSE ME
5606-54666-0033 IT GAVE ME BACK MY SELF POSSESSION IMMEDIATELY TO ASK YOUR PERMISSION TO PAY MY ADDRESSES TO MISS SHERWIN OR TO BE PLAINER STILL IF YOU LIKE TO ASK OF YOU HER HAND IN MARRIAGE THE WORDS WERE SPOKEN
5606-54666-0034 EVEN IF I COULD HAVE DONE SO I WOULD NOT HAVE RECALLED WHAT I HAD JUST SAID BUT STILL I TREMBLED IN SPITE OF MYSELF AS I EXPRESSED IN PLAIN BLUNT WORDS WHAT I HAD ONLY RAPTUROUSLY THOUGHT OVER OR DELICATELY HINTED AT TO MARGARET UP TO THIS TIME
5606-54666-0035 HIGHLY INDEED MY DEAR SIR DON'T SUPPOSE FOR ONE MOMENT I EVER DOUBTED YOUR HONOURABLE FEELING
5606-54666-0036 IN SHORT OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT IN THEIR RANK EXACTLY BUT THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION QUITE A MISUNDERSTANDING EXTREMELY STUPID OF ME TO BE SURE PRAY LET ME OFFER YOU A GLASS OF WINE
5606-54666-0037 IN CONFIDENCE HOW I AM SITUATED WITH REGARD TO THE PROPOSALS I HAVE MADE THERE ARE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES YES YES HE BENT FORWARD AGAIN EAGERLY TOWARDS ME AS HE SPOKE
5606-54666-0038 LOOKING MORE INQUISITIVE AND MORE CUNNING THAN EVER I HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED TO YOU MISTER SHERWIN THAT I HAVE FOUND MEANS TO SPEAK TO YOUR DAUGHTER
5606-54666-0039 NOW ALTHOUGH IN SO MANY WORDS SHE DIRECTLY DISCOURAGED ME IT IS HER DUE THAT I SHOULD SAY THIS STILL I THINK I MAY WITHOUT VANITY VENTURE TO HOPE THAT SHE DID SO AS A MATTER OF DUTY MORE THAN AS A MATTER OF INCLINATION
5606-54666-0040 NO DOUBT THAT WAS ONE REASON WHY SHE RECEIVED ME AS SHE DID BUT SHE HAD ANOTHER WHICH SHE COMMUNICATED TO ME IN THE PLAINEST TERMS THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR RANK OF LIFE
5606-54666-0041 YES YES HIGH PRINCIPLES SIR HIGH PRINCIPLES THANK GOD
5606-54666-0042 SHE MADE NO OBJECTION AND I AM THEREFORE I THINK JUSTIFIED IN CONSIDERING THAT IF YOU AUTHORISED THE REMOVAL OF SCRUPLES WHICH DO HER HONOUR AT PRESENT SHE WOULD NOT FEEL THE DELICACY SHE DOES NOW AT SANCTIONING MY ADDRESSES
5606-54666-0043 VERY PROPER A VERY PROPER WAY OF PUTTING IT PRACTICAL IF I MAY BE ALLOWED TO SAY SO
5606-54666-0044 IT IS EXACTLY THERE THAT THE DIFFICULTY LIES MY FATHER ON WHOM I AM DEPENDENT AS THE YOUNGER SON HAS VERY STRONG PREJUDICES CONVICTIONS I OUGHT PERHAPS TO CALL THEM ON THE SUBJECT OF SOCIAL INEQUALITIES QUITE SO MOST NATURAL
5606-54666-0045 MOST BECOMING INDEED ON THE PART OF YOUR RESPECTED FATHER I HONOUR HIS CONVICTIONS SIR SUCH ESTATES SUCH HOUSES SUCH A FAMILY AS HIS CONNECTED I BELIEVE WITH THE NOBILITY ESPECIALLY ON YOUR LATE LAMENTED MOTHER'S SIDE
5606-54666-0046 MY DEAR SIR I EMPHATICALLY REPEAT IT YOUR FATHER'S CONVICTIONS DO HIM HONOUR I RESPECT THEM AS MUCH AS I RESPECT HIM I DO INDEED I AM GLAD YOU CAN VIEW MY FATHER'S IDEAS ON SOCIAL SUBJECTS IN SO FAVOURABLE A LIGHT MISTER SHERWIN
5606-54666-0047 YOU WILL BE LESS SURPRISED TO HEAR HOW THEY ARE LIKELY TO AFFECT ME IN THE STEP I AM NOW TAKING HE DISAPPROVES OF IT OF COURSE STRONGLY PERHAPS
5606-54666-0048 HE RAN HIS FINGERS RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS HAIR AND TRIED TO LOOK INDEPENDENT STILL I AM PREPARED TO ADMIT UNDER ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES I SAY UNDER ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HIS DISAPPROVAL IS VERY NATURAL
5606-54666-0049 AND WAS VERY MUCH TO BE EXPECTED VERY MUCH INDEED HE HAS EXPRESSED NO DISAPPROVAL MISTER SHERWIN YOU DON'T SAY SO I HAVE NOT GIVEN HIM AN OPPORTUNITY
5606-54666-0050 MY MEETING WITH YOUR DAUGHTER HAS BEEN KEPT A PROFOUND SECRET FROM HIM AND FROM EVERY MEMBER OF MY FAMILY AND A SECRET IT MUST REMAIN I SPEAK FROM MY INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF MY FATHER WHEN I SAY THAT I HARDLY KNOW OF ANY MEANS THAT HE WOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF EMPLOYING
5606-54666-0051 TO FRUSTRATE THE PURPOSE OF THIS VISIT IF I HAD MENTIONED IT TO HIM HE HAS BEEN THE KINDEST AND BEST OF FATHERS TO ME BUT I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT IF I WAITED FOR HIS CONSENT
5606-54666-0052 NO ENTREATIES OF MINE OR OF ANY ONE BELONGING TO ME WOULD INDUCE HIM TO GIVE HIS SANCTION TO THE MARRIAGE I HAVE COME TO YOU TO PROPOSE BLESS MY SOUL THIS IS CARRYING THINGS RATHER FAR THOUGH
5606-54666-0053 WE MUST KEEP BOTH THE COURTSHIP AND THE MARRIAGE SECRET SECRET GOOD GRACIOUS I DON'T AT ALL SEE MY WAY YES SECRET
5606-54666-0054 A PROFOUND SECRET AMONG OURSELVES UNTIL I CAN DIVULGE MY MARRIAGE TO MY FATHER WITH THE BEST CHANCE OF BUT I TELL YOU SIR I CAN'T SEE MY WAY THROUGH IT AT ALL CHANCE WHAT CHANCE WOULD THERE BE AFTER WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME
5606-54666-0055 THERE MIGHT BE MANY CHANCES FOR INSTANCE WHEN THE MARRIAGE WAS SOLEMNISED I MIGHT INTRODUCE YOUR DAUGHTER TO MY FATHER'S NOTICE WITHOUT DISCLOSING WHO SHE WAS AND LEAVE HER GRADUALLY AND UNSUSPECTEDLY
5606-54666-0056 TO WIN HIS AFFECTION AND RESPECT AS WITH HER BEAUTY ELEGANCE AND AMIABILITY SHE COULD NOT FAIL TO DO WHILE I WAITED UNTIL THE OCCASION WAS RIPE FOR CONFESSING EVERYTHING THEN IF I SAID TO HIM
5606-54666-0057 IF ON THE OTHER HAND I COULD ONLY SAY THIS YOUNG LADY IS ABOUT TO BECOME MY WIFE HIS PREJUDICES WOULD ASSUREDLY INDUCE HIM TO RECALL HIS MOST FAVOURABLE IMPRESSIONS AND REFUSE HIS CONSENT IN SHORT MISTER SHERWIN BEFORE MARRIAGE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE HIM
5606-54666-0058 AFTER MARRIAGE WHEN OPPOSITION COULD NO LONGER BE OF ANY AVAIL IT WOULD BE QUITE A DIFFERENT THING WE MIGHT BE SURE OF PRODUCING SOONER OR LATER THE MOST FAVOURABLE RESULTS
5606-54666-0059 THIS IS WHY IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO KEEP OUR UNION SECRET AT FIRST I WONDERED THEN I HAVE SINCE WONDERED MORE HOW IT WAS THAT I CONTRIVED TO SPEAK THUS
5606-54666-0060 RATTLING A BUNCH OF KEYS IN HIS POCKET WITH AN EXPRESSION OF CONSIDERABLE PERPLEXITY
5606-54666-0061 TO HAVE A GENTLEMAN OF YOUR BIRTH AND BREEDING FOR A SON IN LAW IS OF COURSE BUT THEN THERE IS THE MONEY QUESTION SUPPOSE YOU FAILED WITH YOUR FATHER AFTER ALL MY MONEY IS OUT IN MY SPECULATIONS I CAN DO NOTHING
5606-54666-0062 I HAVE INFLUENTIAL FRIENDS MISTER SHERWIN IN MANY DIRECTIONS THERE ARE APPOINTMENTS GOOD APPOINTMENTS WHICH WOULD BE OPEN TO ME IF I PUSHED MY INTERESTS I MIGHT PROVIDE IN THIS WAY AGAINST THE CHANCE OF FAILURE
5606-54666-0063 I CAN ONLY ASSURE YOU THAT MY ATTACHMENT TO MISS SHERWIN IS NOT OF A NATURE TO BE OVERCOME BY ANY PECUNIARY CONSIDERATIONS I SPEAK IN ALL OUR INTERESTS WHEN I SAY
5606-54666-0064 THAT A PRIVATE MARRIAGE GIVES US A CHANCE FOR THE FUTURE AS OPPORTUNITIES ARISE OF GRADUALLY DISCLOSING IT MY OFFER TO YOU MAY BE MADE UNDER SOME DISADVANTAGES AND DIFFICULTIES PERHAPS
5606-54666-0065 FOR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A VERY SMALL INDEPENDENCE LEFT ME BY MY MOTHER I HAVE NO CERTAIN PROSPECTS BUT I REALLY THINK MY PROPOSALS HAVE SOME COMPENSATING ADVANTAGES TO RECOMMEND THEM CERTAINLY
5606-54666-0066 MOST DECIDEDLY SO I AM NOT INSENSIBLE MY DEAR SIR TO THE GREAT ADVANTAGE AND HONOUR AND SO FORTH BUT THERE IS SOMETHING SO UNUSUAL ABOUT THE WHOLE AFFAIR
5606-54666-0067 THAT COULD HARDLY HAPPEN I THINK WITH HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND EDUCATION AND MANNERS TOO SO DISTINGUISHED THOUGH PERHAPS I OUGHT NOT TO SAY SO
5606-54666-0068 I AM SURE MISTER SHERWIN A SCHOOL SIR WHERE IT WAS A RULE TO TAKE IN NO THING LOWER THAN THE DAUGHTER OF A PROFESSIONAL MAN THEY ONLY WAIVED THE RULE IN MY CASE THE MOST GENTEEL SCHOOL PERHAPS IN ALL LONDON A DRAWING ROOM DEPORTMENT DAY ONCE EVERY WEEK
5606-54666-0069 TO PRACTISE THE GIRLS WITH THE FOOTMAN OF THE ESTABLISHMENT IN ATTENDANCE IN GETTING INTO A CARRIAGE AND GETTING OUT AGAIN IN A LADY LIKE MANNER NO DUCHESS HAS HAD A BETTER EDUCATION THAN MY MARGARET PERMIT ME TO ASSURE YOU MISTER SHERWIN AND THEN HER KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGES
5606-54666-0070 HER FRENCH AND ITALIAN AND GERMAN NOT DISCONTINUED IN HOLIDAYS OR AFTER SHE LEFT SCHOOL SHE HAS ONLY JUST LEFT IT
5606-54666-0071 MAY I ASK WHO MISTER MANNION IS THE TONE IN WHICH I PUT THIS QUESTION COOLED HIS ENTHUSIASM ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER'S EDUCATION IMMEDIATELY HE ANSWERED IN HIS FORMER TONES AND WITH ONE OF HIS FORMER BOWS
5606-54666-0072 MISTER MANNION IS MY CONFIDENTIAL CLERK SIR
5606-54666-0073 IS HE A YOUNG MAN YOUNG OH DEAR NO MISTER MANNION IS FORTY OR A YEAR OR TWO MORE IF HE'S A DAY AN ADMIRABLE MAN OF BUSINESS AS WELL AS A GREAT SCHOLAR
5606-54666-0074 I BEG YOUR PARDON BUT I THINK WE ARE WANDERING AWAY FROM THE POINT A LITTLE I BEG YOURS SO WE ARE WELL MY DEAR SIR I MUST BE ALLOWED A DAY OR TWO SAY TWO DAYS TO ASCERTAIN WHAT MY DAUGHTER'S FEELINGS ARE
5606-54666-0075 AND TO CONSIDER YOUR PROPOSALS WHICH HAVE TAKEN ME VERY MUCH BY SURPRISE AS YOU MAY IN FACT SEE BUT I ASSURE YOU I AM MOST FLATTERED MOST HONOURED MOST ANXIOUS I HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER MY ANXIETIES MISTER SHERWIN
5606-54666-0076 AND BETWEEN THAT TIME AND THIS YOU WILL ENGAGE NOT TO HOLD ANY COMMUNICATION WITH MY DAUGHTER I PROMISE NOT MISTER SHERWIN BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT YOUR ANSWER WILL BE FAVOURABLE
5606-54666-0077 A LITTLE CONSIDERATION AND A LITTLE TALK WITH MY DEAR GIRL
5606-54666-0078 NO AGAIN VERY WELL THEN THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW AT FIVE O'CLOCK WITH A LOUDER CRACK THAN EVER THE BRAND NEW DRAWING ROOM DOOR WAS OPENED TO LET ME OUT THE NOISE WAS INSTANTLY SUCCEEDED BY THE RUSTLING OF A SILK DRESS AND THE BANGING OF ANOTHER DOOR AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE PASSAGE
