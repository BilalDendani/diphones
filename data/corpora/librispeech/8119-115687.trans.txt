8119-115687-0000 INCREDIBLE TREASON AFTER RECEIVING THIS REPORT AND REASSURANCES OF SUPPORT FROM THE BIG BOSSES OF THE NEIGHBORING GANGS HART DETERMINED TO REESTABLISH THE WYOMING VALLEY COMMUNITY
8119-115687-0001 A CAREFUL SURVEY OF THE TERRITORY SHOWED THAT IT WAS ONLY THE NORTHERN SECTIONS AND SLOPES THAT HAD BEEN BEAMED BY THE FIRST HAN SHIP THE SYNTHETIC FABRICS PLANT HAD BEEN PARTIALLY WIPED OUT THOUGH THE LOWER LEVELS UNDERGROUND HAD NOT BEEN REACHED BY THE DIS RAY
8119-115687-0002 THE FOREST SCREEN ABOVE IT HOWEVER HAD BEEN ANNIHILATED AND IT WAS DETERMINED TO ABANDON IT AFTER REMOVING ALL USABLE MACHINERY AND EVIDENCES OF THE PROCESSES THAT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO THE HAN SCIENTISTS SHOULD THEY RETURN TO THE VALLEY IN THE FUTURE
8119-115687-0003 THE AMMUNITION PLANT AND THE ROCKET SHIP PLANT WHICH HAD JUST BEEN ABOUT TO START OPERATION AT THE TIME OF THE RAID WERE INTACT AS WERE THE OTHER IMPORTANT PLANTS
8119-115687-0004 FOR THE PHONE PLANT HAD BEEN ONE OF THE FIRST TO BE PUT IN OPERATION AND WHEN IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE HANS DID NOT INTEND ANY IMMEDIATE REPRISALS THE ENTIRE MEMBERSHIP OF THE COMMUNITY WAS SUMMONED BACK AND NORMAL LIFE WAS RESUMED
8119-115687-0005 WILMA AND I HAD BEEN MARRIED THE DAY AFTER THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SHIPS AND SPENT THIS INTERVENING PERIOD IN A DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON CAMPING HIGH IN THE MOUNTAINS ON OUR RETURN WE HAD A CAMP OF OUR OWN
8119-115687-0006 OF COURSE WE WERE ASSIGNED TO LOCATION TEN SEVENTEEN AND AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED WE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF BANTER OVER WHICH ONE OF US WAS CAMP BOSS THE TITLE STOOD AFTER MY NAME
8119-115687-0007 AND THOSE OF THE BIG CAMBOSS OF COURSE BUT WILMA AIRILY HELD THAT THIS MEANT NOTHING AT ALL AND GENERALLY SUCCEEDED IN MAKING ME ADMIT IT WHENEVER SHE CHOSE I FOUND MYSELF A FULL FLEDGED MEMBER OF THE GANG NOW
8119-115687-0008 FOR I HAD ELECTED TO SEARCH NO FARTHER FOR A PERMANENT ALLIANCE MUCH AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO FAMILIARIZE MYSELF WITH THIS TWENTY FIFTH CENTURY LIFE IN OTHER SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY THE WYOMINGS HAD A HIGH MORALE
8119-115687-0009 AND HAD PROSPERED UNDER THE RULE OF BIG BOSS HART FOR MANY YEARS BUT MANY OF THE GANGS I FOUND WERE BADLY ORGANIZED LACKED STRONG HANDS IN AUTHORITY AND WERE RIFE WITH INTRIGUE
8119-115687-0010 ON THE WHOLE I THOUGHT I WOULD BE WISE TO STAY WITH A GROUP WHICH HAD ALREADY PROVED ITS FRIENDLINESS
8119-115687-0011 UNDER THESE MODERN SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THE KIND OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM TO WHICH I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WAS IMPOSSIBLE I WOULD HAVE BEEN AS MUCH OF A NONENTITY IN EVERY PHASE OF HUMAN RELATIONSHIP BY ATTEMPTING TO AVOID ALLIANCES
8119-115687-0012 AS ANY MAN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WOULD HAVE BEEN POLITICALLY WHO ALIGNED HIMSELF WITH NO POLITICAL PARTY THIS ENTIRE MODERN LIFE IT APPEARED TO ME JUDGING FROM MY ANCIENT VIEWPOINT WAS ORGANIZED ALONG WHAT I CALLED
8119-115687-0013 POLITICAL LINES AND IN THIS CONNECTION IT AMUSED ME TO NOTICE HOW UNIVERSAL HAD BECOME THE USE OF THE WORD BOSS THE LEADER THE PERSON IN CHARGE OR AUTHORITY OVER ANYTHING WAS A BOSS
8119-115687-0014 THERE WAS AS LITTLE FORMALITY IN HIS RELATIONS WITH HIS FOLLOWERS AS THERE WAS IN THE CASE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY POLITICAL BOSS AND THE SAME HIGH RESPECT PAID HIM BY HIS FOLLOWERS AS WELL AS THE SAME HIGH CONSIDERATION BY HIM OF THEIR INTERESTS
8119-115687-0015 HE WAS JUST AS MUCH OF AN AUTOCRAT AND JUST AS MUCH DEPENDENT UPON THE GENERAL POPULARITY OF HIS ACTIONS FOR THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN HIS AUTOCRACY THE SUB BOSS WHO COULD NOT COMMAND THE LOYALTY OF HIS FOLLOWERS
8119-115687-0016 WAS AS QUICKLY DEPOSED EITHER BY THEM OR BY HIS SUPERIORS AS THE ANCIENT WARD LEADER OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WHO LOST CONTROL OF HIS VOTES AS SOCIETY WAS ORGANIZED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
8119-115687-0017 INSTEAD OF BY THAT RIGID MILITARY DISCIPLINE AND COMPLETE ASSUMPTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL AS A MERE STANDARDIZED COG IN THE MACHINE BUT OWING TO THE CENTURIES OF DESPERATE SUFFERING THE PEOPLE HAD ENDURED AT THE HANDS OF THE HANS
8119-115687-0018 THERE DEVELOPED A SPIRIT OF SELF SACRIFICE AND CONSIDERATION FOR THE COMMON GOOD THAT MADE THE SCHEME APPLICABLE AND EFFICIENT IN ALL FORMS OF HUMAN CO OPERATION
8119-115687-0019 MY ASSOCIATES REGARD THE THOUGHT WITH AS MUCH HORROR AS MANY WORTHY PEOPLE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY FELT IN REGARD TO ANY HERETICAL SUGGESTION THAT THE ORIGINAL OUTLINE OF GOVERNMENT AS LAID DOWN IN THE FIRST CONSTITUTION
8119-115687-0020 DID NOT APPLY AS WELL TO TWENTIETH CENTURY CONDITIONS AS TO THOSE OF THE EARLY NINETEENTH IN LATER YEARS I FELT THAT THERE WAS A CERTAIN SOFTENING OF MORAL FIBER AMONG THE PEOPLE
8119-115687-0021 SINCE THE HANS HAD BEEN FINALLY DESTROYED WITH ALL THEIR WORKS AND AMERICANS HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW LUXURY ECONOMY I HAVE SEEN SIGNS OF THE REAWAKENING OF GREED OF SELFISHNESS
8119-115687-0022 THE ETERNAL CYCLE SEEMS TO BE AT WORK I FEAR THAT SLOWLY THOUGH SURELY PRIVATE WEALTH IS REAPPEARING CODES OF INFLEXIBILITY ARE DEVELOPING THEY WILL BE FOLLOWED BY CORRUPTION DEGRADATION
8119-115687-0023 AND IN THE END SOME CATACLYSMIC EVENT
8119-115687-0024 AND USHER IN A NEW ONE ALL THIS HOWEVER IS WANDERING AFAR FROM MY STORY WHICH CONCERNS OUR EARLY BATTLES AGAINST THE HANS AND NOT OUR MORE MODERN PROBLEMS OF SELF CONTROL
8119-115687-0025 OUR VICTORY OVER THE SEVEN HAN SHIPS HAD SET THE COUNTRY ABLAZE THE SECRET HAD BEEN CAREFULLY COMMUNICATED TO THE OTHER GANGS AND THE COUNTRY WAS AGOG FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER THERE WAS FEVERISH ACTIVITY IN THE AMMUNITION PLANTS
8119-115687-0026 AND THE HUNTING OF STRAY HAN SHIPS BECAME AN ENTHUSIASTIC SPORT THE RESULTS WERE DISASTROUS TO OUR HEREDITARY ENEMIES FROM THE PACIFIC COAST CAME THE REPORT OF A GREAT TRANSPACIFIC LINER OF SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TONS LIFT
8119-115687-0027 BEING BROUGHT TO EARTH FROM A POSITION OF INVISIBILITY ABOVE THE CLOUDS A DOZEN SACRAMENTOS HAD CAUGHT THE HAZY OUTLINES OF ITS REP RAYS APPROACHING THEM HEAD ON IN THE TWILIGHT LIKE GHOSTLY PILLARS REACHING INTO THE SKY
8119-115687-0028 THEY HAD FIRED ROCKETS INTO IT WITH EASE WHEREAS THEY WOULD HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY IN HITTING IT IF IT HAD BEEN MOVING AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THEIR POSITION THEY GOT ONE REP RAY THE OTHER WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD IT UP
8119-115687-0029 IT FLOATED TO EARTH NOSE DOWN AND SINCE IT WAS UNARMED AND UNARMORED THEY HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN SHOOTING IT TO PIECES AND MASSACRING ITS CREW AND PASSENGERS IT SEEMED BARBAROUS TO ME
8119-115687-0030 BUT THEN I DID NOT HAVE CENTURIES OF BITTER PERSECUTION IN MY BLOOD FROM THE JERSEY BEACHES WE RECEIVED NEWS OF THE DESTRUCTION OF A NU YOK A LAN A LINER
8119-115687-0031 THE SAND SNIPERS PRACTICALLY INVISIBLE IN THEIR SAND COLORED CLOTHING AND HALF BURIED ALONG THE BEACHES LAY IN WAIT FOR DAYS RISKING THE PLAY OF DIS BEAMS ALONG THE ROUTE AND FINALLY REGISTERING FOUR HITS WITHIN A WEEK
8119-115687-0032 THE HANS DISCONTINUED THEIR SERVICE ALONG THIS ROUTE AND AS EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE BADLY SHAKEN BY OUR SUCCESS SENT NO RAIDERS DOWN THE BEACHES
8119-115687-0033 ONE OF THEM WILL BECOME PUBLIC PROPERTY IN A FEW DAYS I THINK WE AREN'T GOING TO GET ANY MORE HAN SHIPS BY SHOOTING UP THEIR REPELLOR RAYS UNLESS WE USE MUCH LARGER ROCKETS THEY ARE WISE TO US NOW
8119-115687-0034 THEY'RE PUTTING ARMOR OF GREAT THICKNESS IN THE HULLS OF THEIR SHIPS BELOW THE REP RAY MACHINES
8119-115687-0035 BUT DID NOT PENETRATE AS NEAR AS WE CAN GATHER FROM THEIR REPORTS THEIR LABORATORIES HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW ALLOY OF GREAT TENSILE STRENGTH AND ELASTICITY WHICH NEVERTHELESS
8119-115687-0036 OUR REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE ERIES ROCKETS BOUNCED OFF HARMLESSLY MOST OF THE PARTY WAS WIPED OUT AS THE DIS RAYS WENT INTO ACTION ON THEM THIS IS GOING TO MEAN REAL BUSINESS FOR ALL OF THE GANGS BEFORE LONG
8119-115687-0037 THE BIG BOSSES HAVE JUST HELD A NATIONAL ULTROPHONE COUNCIL IT WAS DECIDED THAT AMERICA MUST ORGANIZE ON A NATIONAL BASIS THE FIRST MOVE IS TO DEVELOP SECTIONAL ORGANIZATION BY ZONES I HAVE BEEN MADE SUPERBOSS OF THE MID ATLANTIC ZONE
8119-115687-0038 WE'RE IN FOR IT NOW THE HANS ARE SURE TO LAUNCH REPRISAL EXPEDITIONS IF WE'RE TO SAVE THE RACE WE MUST KEEP THEM AWAY FROM OUR CAMPS AND PLANTS I'M THINKING OF DEVELOPING A PERMANENT FIELD FORCE
8119-115687-0039 ALONG THE LINES OF THE REGULAR ARMIES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY YOU TOLD ME ABOUT ITS BUSINESS WILL BE TWOFOLD TO CARRY THE WARFARE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO THE HANS AND TO SERVE AS A DECOY
8119-115687-0040 AMAZING AND IMPOSSIBLE AS IT SEEMS THERE IS A GROUP OR PERHAPS AN ENTIRE GANG SOMEWHERE AMONG US THAT IS BETRAYING US TO THE HANS IT MAY BE THE BAD BLOODS
8119-115687-0041 OR IT MAY BE ONE OF THOSE GANGS WHO LIVE NEAR ONE OF THE HAN CITIES YOU KNOW A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS AGO THERE WERE CERTAIN OF THESE PEOPLE'S ANCESTORS WHO ACTUALLY DEGRADED THEMSELVES BY MATING WITH THE HANS
8119-115687-0042 SOMETIMES EVEN SERVING THEM AS SLAVES IN THE DAYS BEFORE THEY BROUGHT ALL THEIR SERVICE MACHINERY TO PERFECTION THERE IS SUCH A GANG CALLED THE NAGRAS UP NEAR BAH FLO AND ANOTHER IN MID JERSEY
8119-115687-0043 THAT MEN CALL THE PINEYS BUT I HARDLY SUSPECT THE PINEYS THERE IS LITTLE INTELLIGENCE AMONG THEM THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THE INFORMATION TO GIVE THE HANS NOR WOULD THEY BE CAPABLE OF IMPARTING IT THEY'RE ABSOLUTE SAVAGES
8119-115687-0044 JUST WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE THAT ANYBODY HAS BEEN CLEARING INFORMATION TO THE HANS I ASKED WELL HE REPLIED FIRST OF ALL THERE WAS THAT RAID UPON US
8119-115687-0045 THAT FIRST HAN SHIP KNEW THE LOCATION OF OUR PLANTS EXACTLY YOU REMEMBER IT FLOATED DIRECTLY INTO POSITION ABOVE THE VALLEY AND BEGAN A SYSTEMATIC BEAMING THEN
8119-115687-0046 THE HANS QUITE OBVIOUSLY HAVE LEARNED THAT WE ARE PICKING UP THEIR ELECTROPHONE WAVES FOR THEY'VE GONE BACK TO THEIR OLD BUT EXTREMELY ACCURATE SYSTEM OF DIRECTIONAL CONTROL
8119-115687-0047 BUT WE'VE BEEN GETTING THEM FOR THE PAST WEEK BY INSTALLING AUTOMATIC RE BROADCAST UNITS ALONG THE SCAR PATHS THIS IS WHAT THE AMERICANS CALLED THOSE STRIPS OF COUNTRY DIRECTLY UNDER THE REGULAR SHIP ROUTES OF THE HANS
8119-115687-0048 BUT THEY'VE BEEN BEAMING THOSE PATHS SO HARD IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THEY EVEN HAD INFORMATION OF THIS STRATEGY AND IN ADDITION THEY'VE BEEN USING CODE FINALLY
8119-115687-0049 WE'VE PICKED UP THREE OF THEIR MESSAGES IN WHICH THEY DISCUSS WITH SOME NERVOUSNESS THE EXISTENCE OF OUR MYSTERIOUS ULTROPHONE BUT THEY STILL HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE AND CONTROL OF ULTRONIC ACTIVITY I ASKED
8119-115687-0050 NO SAID THE BIG BOSS THOUGHTFULLY THEY DON'T SEEM TO HAVE A BIT OF INFORMATION ABOUT IT THEN IT'S QUITE CLEAR I VENTURED THAT WHOEVER IS CLEARING US TO THEM IS DOING IT PIECEMEAL
8119-115687-0051 IT SOUNDS LIKE A BIT OF OCCASIONAL BARTER RATHER THAN AN OUT AND OUT ALLIANCE THEY'RE HOLDING BACK AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE FOR FUTURE BARTERING PERHAPS YES HART SAID
8119-115687-0052 AND IT ISN'T INFORMATION THE HANS ARE GIVING IN RETURN BUT SOME FORM OF GOODS OR PRIVILEGE
