7552-87290-0000 AND WOULD HAVE A PARTY IN PURSUIT THE RUNAWAYS HOWEVER WOULD HAVE AT LEAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE START AND A SHIP LEAVES NO TRACKS WHEN MARY LEFT ME SHE WAS PERHAPS TWO THIRDS OF A LEAGUE FROM THE RENDEZVOUS
7552-87290-0001 BUT WHEN HE CAME I FOUND THE THREAD AND UNOBSERVED REMOVED IT I QUICKLY TOOK IT TO JANE WHO HAS IT YET AND CHERISHES IT FOR THE MUTE MESSAGE OF COMFORT IT BROUGHT HER IN CASE THE HORSE SHOULD NOT RETURN I WAS TO FIND A TOKEN IN A HOLLOW TREE NEAR THE PLACE OF MEETING
7552-87290-0002 BUT THE THREAD IN THE FORELOCK TOLD US OUR FRIENDS HAD FOUND EACH OTHER WHEN WE LEFT THE CASTLE MARY WORE UNDER HER RIDING HABIT A SUIT OF MAN'S ATTIRE AND AS WE RODE ALONG SHE WOULD SHRUG HER SHOULDERS AND LAUGH AS IF IT WERE A HUGE JOKE
7552-87290-0003 AND BY THE MOST COMICAL LITTLE PANTOMIME CALL MY ATTENTION TO HER UNUSUAL BULK SO WHEN SHE FOUND BRANDON THE ONLY CHANGE NECESSARY TO MAKE A MAN OF HER WAS TO THROW OFF THE RIDING HABIT AND PULL ON THE JACK BOOTS AND SLOUCH HAT BOTH OF WHICH BRANDON HAD WITH HIM
7552-87290-0004 THEY WASTED NO TIME YOU MAY BE SURE AND WERE SOON UNDER WAY IN A FEW MINUTES THEY PICKED UP THE TWO BRISTOL MEN WHO WERE TO ACCOMPANY THEM AND WHEN NIGHT HAD FAIRLY FALLEN
7552-87290-0005 IN FACT THERE WAS MORE DANGER OF LOSING ONE'S SELF IN ITS FATHOMLESS MUD HOLES AND QUAGMIRES BRANDON HAD RECENTLY PASSED OVER IT TWICE AND HAD MADE MENTAL NOTE OF THE WORST PLACES SO HE HOPED TO AVOID THEM SOON THE RAIN BEGAN TO FALL IN A SOAKING DRIZZLE
7552-87290-0006 IT WAS ONE OF THOSE BLACK NIGHTS FIT FOR WITCH TRAVELING AND NO DOUBT EVERY WITCH IN ENGLAND WAS OUT BREWING MISCHIEF THE HORSES HOOFS SUCKED AND SPLASHED IN THE MUD WITH A SOUND THAT MARY THOUGHT MIGHT BE HEARD AT LAND'S END AND THE HOOT OF AN OWL NOW AND THEN DISTURBED BY A WITCH
7552-87290-0007 THE WIND WHICH HAD ARISEN WITH JUST ENOUGH FORCE TO SET UP A DISMAL WAIL GAVE THE RAIN A HORIZONTAL SLANT AND DROVE IT IN AT EVERY OPENING
7552-87290-0008 THE FLAPS OF THE COMFORTABLE GREAT CLOAK BLEW BACK FROM MARY'S KNEES AND SHE FELT MANY A CHILLING DROP THROUGH HER FINE NEW SILK TRUNKS THAT MADE HER WISH FOR BUCKRAM IN THEIR PLACE SOON THE WATER BEGAN TO TRICKLE DOWN HER LEGS AND FIND LODGMENT IN THE JACK BOOTS
7552-87290-0009 AND AS THE RAIN AND WIND CAME IN TREMULOUS LITTLE WHIRS SHE FELT WRETCHED ENOUGH
7552-87290-0010 SHE WHO HAD ALWAYS BEEN SO WELL SHELTERED FROM EVERY BLAST NOW AND THEN MUD AND WATER WOULD FLY UP INTO HER FACE STRIKING USUALLY IN THE EYES OR MOUTH AND THEN AGAIN HER HORSE WOULD STUMBLE AND ALMOST THROW HER OVER HIS HEAD
7552-87290-0011 AS HE SANK KNEE DEEP INTO SOME UNEXPECTED HOLE ALL OF THIS WITH THE THOUSAND AND ONE NOISES THAT BROKE THE STILL WORSE SILENCE OF THE INKY NIGHT
7552-87290-0012 SOON BEGAN TO WORK UPON HER NERVES AND MAKE HER FEARFUL THE ROAD WAS FULL OF DANGERS ASIDE FROM STUMBLING HORSES AND BROKEN NECKS FOR MANY WERE THE STORIES OF MURDER AND ROBBERY COMMITTED ALONG THE ROUTE THEY WERE TRAVELING IT IS TRUE THEY HAD TWO STOUT MEN AND ALL WERE ARMED YET THEY MIGHT EASILY COME UPON A PARTY TOO STRONG FOR THEM
7552-87290-0013 AND NO ONE COULD TELL WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN THOUGHT THE PRINCESS THERE WAS THAT PITCHY DARKNESS THROUGH WHICH SHE COULD HARDLY SEE HER HORSE'S HEAD A THING OF ITSELF THAT SEEMED TO HAVE INFINITE POWERS FOR MISCHIEF
7552-87290-0014 AND WHICH NO AMOUNT OF ARGUMENT EVER INDUCED ANY NORMALLY CONSTITUTED WOMAN TO BELIEVE WAS THE MERE NEGATIVE ABSENCE OF LIGHT AND NOT A TERRIBLE ENTITY POTENT FOR ALL SORTS OF MISCHIEF THEN THAT WAILING HOWL THAT ROSE AND FELL BETIMES
7552-87290-0015 NO WIND EVER MADE SUCH A NOISE SHE FELT SURE THERE WERE THOSE SHINING WHITE GLEAMS WHICH CAME FROM THE LITTLE POOLS OF WATER ON THE ROAD LOOKING LIKE DEAD MEN'S FACES UPTURNED AND PALE
7552-87290-0016 PERHAPS THEY WERE WATER AND PERHAPS THEY WERE NOT MARY HAD ALL CONFIDENCE IN BRANDON BUT THAT VERY FACT OPERATED AGAINST HER HAVING THAT CONFIDENCE AND TRUST IN HIM SHE FELT NO NEED TO WASTE HER OWN ENERGY IN BEING BRAVE SO SHE RELAXED COMPLETELY
7552-87290-0017 AND HAD THE FEMININE SATISFACTION OF ALLOWING HERSELF TO BE THOROUGHLY FRIGHTENED IS IT ANY WONDER MARY'S GALLANT BUT WOMANLY SPIRIT SANK LOW IN THE FACE OF ALL THOSE TERRORS
7552-87290-0018 THAT ARE TIDY ENOUGH BUT THIS ONE WAS A LITTLE OFF THE MAIN ROAD SELECTED FOR THAT REASON AND THE UNCLEANNESS WAS NOT THE LEAST OF MARY'S TRIALS THAT HARD NIGHT SHE HAD NOT TASTED FOOD SINCE NOON AND FELT THE KEEN HUNGER NATURAL TO YOUTH AND HEALTH SUCH AS HERS
7552-87290-0019 AFTER TWELVE HOURS OF FASTING AND EIGHT HOURS OF RIDING HER APPETITE SOON OVERCAME HER REPUGNANCE AND SHE ATE WITH A ZEST THAT WAS NEW TO HER THE HUMBLEST FARE THAT HAD EVER PASSED HER LIPS ONE OFTEN MISSES THE ZEST OF LIFE'S JOYS BY HAVING TOO MUCH OF THEM
7552-87290-0020 ONE MUST WANT A THING BEFORE IT CAN BE APPRECIATED A HARD RIDE OF FIVE HOURS BROUGHT OUR TRAVELERS TO BATH WHICH PLACE THEY RODE AROUND JUST AS THE SUN BEGAN TO GILD THE TILE ROOFS AND STEEPLES
7552-87290-0021 AND ANOTHER HOUR BROUGHT THEM TO BRISTOL THE SHIP WAS TO SAIL AT SUNRISE BUT AS THE WIND HAD DIED OUT WITH THE NIGHT
7552-87290-0022 THERE WAS NO DANGER OF ITS SAILING WITHOUT THEM SOON THE GATES OPENED AND THE PARTY RODE TO THE BOW AND STRING WHERE BRANDON HAD LEFT THEIR CHESTS THE MEN WERE THEN PAID OFF QUICK SALE WAS MADE OF THE HORSES BREAKFAST WAS SERVED AND THEY STARTED FOR THE WHARF
7552-87290-0023 WITH THEIR CHESTS FOLLOWING IN THE HANDS OF FOUR PORTERS A BOAT SOON TOOK THEM ABOARD THE ROYAL HIND AND NOW IT LOOKED AS IF THEIR DARING SCHEME SO FULL OF IMPROBABILITY AS TO SEEM IMPOSSIBLE HAD REALLY COME TO A SUCCESSFUL ISSUE FROM THE BEGINNING I THINK IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO MARY TO DOUBT THE RESULT
7552-87290-0024 THERE HAD NEVER BEEN WITH HER EVEN A SUGGESTION OF POSSIBLE FAILURE UNLESS IT WAS THAT EVENING IN OUR ROOM WHEN PROMPTED BY HER STARTLED MODESTY SHE HAD SAID SHE COULD NOT BEAR FOR US TO SEE HER IN THE TRUNK HOSE NOW THAT FRUITION SEEMED ABOUT TO CROWN HER HOPES SHE WAS HAPPY TO HER HEART'S CORE
7552-87290-0025 AND WHEN ONCE TO HERSELF WEPT FOR SHEER JOY IT IS LITTLE WONDER SHE WAS HAPPY SHE WAS LEAVING BEHIND NO ONE WHOM SHE LOVED EXCEPTING JANE AND PERHAPS ME
7552-87290-0026 SHE WAS ALSO FLEEING WITH THE ONE MAN IN ALL THE WORLD FOR HER AND FROM A MARRIAGE THAT WAS LITERALLY WORSE THAN DEATH BRANDON ON THE OTHER HAND HAD ALWAYS HAD MORE DESIRE THAN HOPE THE MANY CHANCES AGAINST SUCCESS HAD FORCED UPON HIM A HAUNTING SENSE OF CERTAIN FAILURE
7552-87290-0027 AND IN THIS CASE THEY WERE OVERWHELMINGLY UNFAVORABLE SUCH HOPE AS HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DISTIL OUT OF HIS DESIRE WAS SADLY DAMPENED BY AN EVER PRESENT PREMONITION OF FAILURE WHICH HE COULD NOT ENTIRELY THROW OFF
7552-87290-0028 TOO KEEN AN INSIGHT FOR THE TRUTH OFTEN STANDS IN A MAN'S WAY AND TOO CLEAR A VIEW OF AN OVERWHELMING OBSTACLE IS APT TO PARALYZE EFFORT HOPE MUST ALWAYS BE BEHIND A HEARTY ENDEAVOR
7552-87290-0029 THEY HAD BOTH PAID FOR THEIR PASSAGE ALTHOUGH THEY HAD ENLISTED AND WERE PART OF THE SHIP'S COMPANY THEY WERE NOT EXPECTED TO DO SAILOR'S WORK BUT WOULD BE CALLED UPON IN CASE OF FIGHTING
7552-87290-0030 TO DO THEIR PART AT THAT MARY WAS PROBABLY AS GOOD A FIGHTER IN HER OWN WAY AS ONE COULD FIND IN A LONG JOURNEY
7552-87290-0031 THAT HOWEVER WAS A BRIDGE TO BE CROSSED WHEN THEY SHOULD COME TO IT THEY HAD GONE ABOARD ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK AND BRANDON HOPED THE SHIP WOULD BE WELL DOWN BRISTOL CHANNEL BEFORE HE SHOULD LEAVE HIS BERTH
7552-87290-0032 BUT THE WIND THAT HAD FILLED MARY'S JACK BOOTS WITH RAIN AND HAD HOWLED SO DISMALLY ALL NIGHT LONG WOULD NOT STIR NOW THAT IT WAS WANTED
7552-87290-0033 NOON CAME YET NO WIND AND THE SUN SHONE AS PLACIDLY AS IF CAPTAIN CHARLES BRANDON WERE NOT FUMING WITH IMPATIENCE ON THE POOP OF THE ROYAL HIND
7552-87290-0034 THE CAPTAIN SAID IT WOULD COME WITH NIGHT BUT SUNDOWN WAS ALMOST AT HAND AND NO WIND YET BRANDON KNEW THIS MEANT FAILURE IF IT HELD A LITTLE LONGER FOR HE WAS CERTAIN THE KING WITH WOLSEY'S HELP WOULD LONG SINCE HAVE GUESSED THE TRUTH
7552-87290-0035 BRANDON HAD NOT SEEN THE PRINCESS SINCE MORNING AND THE DELICACY HE FELT ABOUT GOING TO HER CABIN MADE THE SITUATION SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT AFTER PUTTING IT OFF FROM HOUR TO HOUR IN HOPE THAT SHE WOULD APPEAR OF HER OWN ACCORD HE AT LAST KNOCKED AT HER DOOR
7552-87290-0036 AND OF COURSE FOUND THE LADY IN TROUBLE
7552-87290-0037 THE PORT WAS OPEN AND SHOWED HER ROSY AS THE MORN WHEN SHE LOOKED UP AT HIM THE JACK BOOTS WERE IN A CORNER AND HER LITTLE FEET SEEMED TO PUT UP A PROTEST ALL THEIR OWN AGAINST GOING INTO THEM THAT OUGHT TO HAVE SOFTENED EVERY PEG
7552-87290-0038 DO YOU REGRET COMING LADY MARY ASKED BRANDON WHO NOW THAT SHE WAS ALONE WITH HIM FELT THAT HE MUST TAKE NO ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT TO BE FAMILIAR NO NO NOT FOR ONE MOMENT I AM GLAD ONLY TOO GLAD
7552-87290-0039 BUT WHY DO YOU CALL ME LADY YOU USED TO CALL ME MARY I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS BECAUSE YOU ARE ALONE AH THAT IS GOOD OF YOU
7552-87290-0040 THE MATTER WAS SETTLED BY MUTE BUT SATISFACTORY ARBITRATION AND BRANDON CONTINUED YOU MUST MAKE YOURSELF READY TO GO ON DECK IT WILL BE HARD BUT IT MUST BE DONE HE HELPED HER WITH THE HEAVY JACK BOOTS AND HANDED HER THE RAIN STAINED SLOUCH HAT
7552-87290-0041 WHICH SHE PUT ON AND STOOD A COMPLETE MAN READY FOR THE DECK THAT IS AS COMPLETE AS COULD BE EVOLVED FROM HER UTTER FEMININITY WHEN BRANDON LOOKED HER OVER ALL HOPE WENT OUT OF HIM
7552-87290-0042 WHAT IS IT THAT DESPITE EVERYTHING SHOWS SO UNMISTAKABLY FEMININE
7552-87290-0043 I HAVE IT YOU SHALL REMAIN HERE UNDER THE PRETENSE OF ILLNESS UNTIL WE ARE WELL AT SEA AND THEN I WILL TELL THE CAPTAIN ALL IT IS TOO BAD AND YET I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU ONE WHIT LESS A WOMAN FOR ALL THE WORLD
7552-87290-0044 A MAN LOVES A WOMAN WHO IS SO THOROUGHLY WOMANLY THAT NOTHING CAN HIDE IT MARY WAS PLEASED AT HIS FLATTERY BUT DISAPPOINTED AT THE FAILURE IN HERSELF SHE HAD THOUGHT THAT SURELY THESE GARMENTS WOULD MAKE A MAN OF HER IN WHICH THE KEENEST EYE COULD NOT DETECT A FLAW
7552-87290-0045 THEY WERE DISCUSSING THE MATTER WHEN A KNOCK CAME AT THE DOOR WITH THE CRY ALL HANDS ON DECK FOR INSPECTION INSPECTION JESU MARY WOULD NOT SAFELY ENDURE IT A MINUTE BRANDON LEFT HER AT ONCE AND WENT TO THE CAPTAIN
7552-87290-0046 BRADHURST A SURLY OLD HALF PIRATE OF THE SALTIEST PATTERN ANSWERED ILL
7552-87290-0047 I WILL REFUND HIS MONEY WE CANNOT MAKE A HOSPITAL OUT OF THE SHIP IF HIS LORDSHIP IS TOO ILL TO STAND INSPECTION SEE THAT HE GOES ASHORE AT ONCE
7552-87290-0048 HE THEN RETURNED TO MARY AND AFTER BUCKLING ON HER SWORD AND BELT THEY WENT ON DECK AND CLIMBED UP THE POOP LADDER TO TAKE THEIR PLACES WITH THOSE ENTITLED TO STAND AFT
7552-87290-0049 BRANDON HAS OFTEN TOLD ME SINCE THAT IT WAS AS MUCH AS HE COULD DO TO KEEP BACK THE TEARS WHEN HE SAW MARY'S WONDERFUL EFFORT TO APPEAR MANLY IT WAS BOTH COMICAL AND PATHETIC
7552-87290-0050 SHE WAS A PRINCESS TO WHOM ALL THE WORLD BOWED DOWN YET THAT DID NOT HELP HER HERE AFTER ALL SHE WAS ONLY A GIRL TIMID AND FEARFUL FOLLOWING AT BRANDON'S HEELS
7552-87290-0051 FRIGHTENED LEST SHE SHOULD GET OUT OF ARM'S REACH OF HIM AMONG THOSE ROUGH MEN AND LONGING WITH ALL HER HEART TO TAKE HIS HAND FOR MORAL AS WELL AS PHYSICAL SUPPORT IT MUST HAVE BEEN BOTH LAUGHABLE AND PATHETIC IN THE EXTREME
7552-87290-0052 THAT MISERABLE SWORD PERSISTED IN TRIPPING HER AND THE JACK BOOTS SO MUCH TOO LARGE EVINCED AN ALARMING TENDENCY TO SLIP OFF WITH EVERY STEP HOW INSANE WE ALL WERE NOT TO HAVE FORESEEN THIS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
7552-87290-0053 IT MUST HAVE BEEN A UNIQUE FIGURE SHE PRESENTED CLIMBING UP THE STEPS AT BRANDON'S HEELS JACK BOOTS AND ALL SO UNIQUE WAS IT THAT THE SAILORS WORKING IN THE SHIP'S WAIST STOPPED THEIR TASKS TO STARE IN WONDERMENT
7552-87290-0054 AND THE GENTLEMEN ON THE POOP MADE NO EFFORT TO HIDE THEIR AMUSEMENT OLD BRADHURST STEPPED UP TO HER I HOPE YOUR LORDSHIP IS FEELING BETTER
7552-87290-0055 I DECLARE YOU LOOK THE PICTURE OF HEALTH
7552-87290-0056 HOW OLD ARE YOU MARY QUICKLY RESPONDED FOURTEEN YEARS FOURTEEN RETURNED BRADHURST WELL I DON'T THINK YOU WILL SHED MUCH BLOOD YOU LOOK MORE LIKE A DEUCED HANDSOME GIRL THAN ANY MAN I EVER SAW
7552-87290-0057 AT THIS THE MEN ALL LAUGHED AND WERE VERY IMPERTINENT IN THE FREE AND EASY MANNER OF SUCH GENTRY MOST OF WHOM WERE PROFESSIONAL ADVENTURERS WITH EVERY FINER SENSE DULLED AND DEBASED BY YEARS OF VICE
7552-87290-0058 THESE FELLOWS HALF OF THEM TIPSY NOW GATHERED ABOUT MARY TO INSPECT HER PERSONALLY EACH ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT THEIR LOOKS AND CONDUCT WERE VERY DISCONCERTING BUT THEY DID NOTHING INSULTING UNTIL ONE FELLOW GAVE HER A SLAP ON THE BACK
7552-87290-0059 ACCOMPANYING IT BY AN INDECENT REMARK BRANDON TRIED TO PAY NO ATTENTION TO THEM BUT THIS WAS TOO MUCH SO HE LIFTED HIS ARM AND KNOCKED THE FELLOW OFF THE POOP INTO THE WAIST
7552-87290-0060 THE MAN WAS BACK IN A MOMENT AND SWORDS WERE SOON DRAWN AND CLICKING AWAY AT A GREAT RATE THE CONTEST WAS BRIEF HOWEVER AS THE FELLOW WAS NO SORT OF MATCH FOR BRANDON WHO WITH HIS OLD TRICK QUICKLY TWISTED HIS ADVERSARY'S SWORD OUT OF HIS GRASP
7552-87290-0061 AND WITH A FLASH OF HIS OWN BLADE FLUNG IT INTO THE SEA THE OTHER MEN WERE NOW TALKING TOGETHER AT A LITTLE DISTANCE IN WHISPERS AND IN A MOMENT ONE DRUNKEN BRUTE SHOUTED IT IS NO MAN IT IS A WOMAN
7552-87290-0062 THE FELLOW HAD UNBUCKLED MARY'S DOUBLET AT THE THROAT AND WITH A JERK HAD TORN IT HALF OFF CARRYING AWAY THE SLEEVE AND EXPOSING MARY'S SHOULDER ALMOST THROWING HER TO THE DECK HE WAVED HIS TROPHY ON HIGH
7552-87290-0063 BUT HIS TRIUMPH WAS SHORT LIVED FOR ALMOST INSTANTLY IT FELL TO THE DECK AND WITH IT THE OFFENDING HAND SEVERED AT THE WRIST BY BRANDON'S SWORD THREE OR FOUR FRIENDS OF THE WOUNDED MAN RUSHED UPON BRANDON WHEREUPON MARY SCREAMED AND BEGAN TO WEEP
7552-87290-0064 WHICH OF COURSE TOLD THE WHOLE STORY
7552-87290-0065 AND THROW IT OFF AS THE SUN THROWS OFF ITS HEAT HOWEVER JANE IS AN EXCEPTION TO THAT RULE IF IT IS A RULE THE OFFICERS SOON PUT A STOP TO THIS LIVELY LITTLE FIGHT AND TOOK BRANDON AND MARY WHO WAS WEEPING AS ANY RIGHT MINDED WOMAN WOULD
7552-87290-0066 DOWN INTO THE CABIN FOR CONSULTATION WITH A GREAT OATH BRADHURST EXCLAIMED IT IS PLAIN ENOUGH THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT A GIRL ON BOARD UNDER FALSE COLORS AND YOU MAY AS WELL MAKE READY TO PUT HER ASHORE
7552-87290-0067 YOU SEE WHAT SHE HAS ALREADY DONE A HAND LOST TO ONE MAN AND WOUNDS FOR TWENTY OTHERS
7552-87290-0068 ASKED BRADHURST WITH HIS HAT OFF INSTANTLY YES ANSWERED THAT INDIVIDUAL I SHIPPED UNDER AN ASSUMED NAME FOR VARIOUS REASONS AND DESIRE NOT TO BE KNOWN YOU WILL DO WELL TO KEEP MY SECRET
7552-87290-0069 DO I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE MASTER CHARLES BRANDON THE KING'S FRIEND ASKED BRADHURST I AM WAS THE ANSWER THEN SIR I MUST ASK YOUR PARDON FOR THE WAY YOU HAVE BEEN TREATED
7552-87290-0070 WE OF COURSE COULD NOT KNOW IT BUT A MAN MUST EXPECT TROUBLE WHEN HE ATTACHES HIMSELF TO A WOMAN IT IS A WONDER THE FLASHES FROM MARY'S EYES DID NOT STRIKE THE OLD SEA DOG DEAD HE HOWEVER DID NOT SEE THEM AND WENT ON
7552-87290-0071 WE ARE MORE THAN ANXIOUS THAT SO VALIANT A KNIGHT AS SIR CHARLES BRANDON SHOULD GO WITH US AND HOPE YOUR RECEPTION WILL NOT DRIVE YOU BACK BUT AS TO THE LADY YOU SEE ALREADY THE RESULT OF HER PRESENCE AND MUCH AS WE WANT YOU WE CANNOT TAKE HER
7552-87290-0072 ASIDE FROM THE GENERAL TROUBLE WHICH A WOMAN TAKES WITH HER EVERYWHERE MARY WOULD NOT EVEN LOOK AT THE CREATURE ON SHIPBOARD THERE IS ANOTHER AND GREATER OBJECTION IT IS SAID YOU KNOW AMONG SAILORS
7552-87290-0073 THAT A WOMAN ON BOARD DRAWS BAD LUCK TO CERTAIN SORTS OF SHIPS AND EVERY SAILOR WOULD DESERT BEFORE WE COULD WEIGH ANCHOR IF IT WERE KNOWN THIS LADY WAS TO GO WITH US SHOULD THEY FIND IT OUT IN MID OCEAN A MUTINY WOULD BE SURE TO FOLLOW
7552-87290-0074 AND GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN FOR HER SAKE IF FOR NO OTHER REASON TAKE HER ASHORE AT ONCE BRANDON SAW ONLY TOO PLAINLY THE TRUTH THAT HE HAD REALLY SEEN ALL THE TIME
7552-87290-0075 BUT TO WHICH HE HAD SHUT HIS EYES AND THROWING MARY'S CLOAK OVER HER SHOULDERS PREPARED TO GO ASHORE AS THEY WENT OVER THE SIDE AND PULLED OFF A GREAT SHOUT WENT UP FROM THE SHIP FAR MORE DERISIVE THAN CHEERING
7552-87290-0076 AND THE MEN AT THE OARS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER ASKANCE AND SMILED WHAT A PREDICAMENT FOR A PRINCESS BRANDON CURSED HIMSELF FOR HAVING BEEN SUCH A KNAVE AND FOOL AS TO ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN
7552-87290-0077 HE HAD KNOWN THE DANGER ALL THE TIME AND HIS ACT COULD NOT BE CHARGEABLE TO IGNORANCE OR A FAILURE TO SEE THE PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES TEMPTATION AND SELFISH DESIRE HAD GIVEN HIM TEMERITY IN PLACE OF JUDGMENT
7552-87290-0078 HE HAD ATTEMPTED WHAT NONE BUT AN INSANE MAN WOULD HAVE TRIED WITHOUT EVEN THE PITIABLE EXCUSE OF INSANITY
7552-87290-0079 HE HAD SEEN IT ALL ONLY TOO CLEARLY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AND HE HAD DELIBERATELY AND WITH OPEN EYES BROUGHT DISGRACE RUIN AND DEATH UNLESS HE COULD ESCAPE UPON HIMSELF AND UTTER HUMILIATION
7552-87290-0080 TO HER WHOM HIS LOVE SHOULD HAVE PROMPTED HIM TO SAVE AT ALL COST IF MARY COULD ONLY HAVE DISGUISED HERSELF TO LOOK LIKE A MAN THEY MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED
7552-87290-0081 BUT THAT LITTLE IF WAS LARGER THAN PAUL'S CHURCH AND BLOCKED THE ROAD AS COMPLETELY AS IF IT HAD BEEN A WORD OF TWENTY SYLLABLES WHEN THE PRINCESS STEPPED ASHORE IT SEEMED TO HER AS IF THE HEART IN HER BREAST WAS A DIFFERENT AND SEPARATE ORGAN FROM THE ONE SHE HAD CARRIED ABOARD
7552-87290-0082 AS THE BOAT PUT OFF AGAIN FOR THE SHIP ITS CREW GAVE A CHEER COUPLED WITH SOME VILE ADVICE FOR WHICH BRANDON WOULD GLADLY HAVE RUN THEM THROUGH EACH AND EVERY ONE
7552-87290-0083 AND REALLY BLAMED NO ONE BUT HIMSELF THOUGH IT WAS TORTURE TO HIM THAT THIS GIRL SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO SUCH INSULTS AND HE POWERLESS TO AVENGE THEM THE NEWS HAD SPREAD FROM THE WHARF LIKE WILDFIRE AND ON THEIR WAY BACK TO THE BOW AND STRING
7552-87290-0084 THERE CAME FROM SMALL BOYS AND HIDDEN VOICES SUCH EXCLAMATIONS AS
7552-87290-0085 ISN'T HE A BEAUTIFUL MAN LOOK AT HIM BLUSH AND OTHERS TOO COARSE TO BE REPEATED IMAGINE THE HUMILIATING SITUATION FROM WHICH THERE WAS NO ESCAPE AT LAST THEY REACHED THE INN
7552-87290-0086 WHITHER THEIR CHESTS SOON FOLLOWED THEM SENT BY BRADHURST TOGETHER WITH THEIR PASSAGE MONEY WHICH HE VERY HONESTLY REFUNDED MARY SOON DONNED HER WOMAN'S ATTIRE OF WHICH SHE HAD A SUPPLY IN HER CHEST
7552-87290-0087 SHE HAD MADE HER TOILET ALONE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE HAVING NO MAID TO HELP HER AND WEPT AS SHE DRESSED FOR THIS DISAPPOINTMENT WAS LIKE PLUCKING THE VERY HEART OUT OF HER
7552-87290-0088 HER HOPE HAD BEEN SO HIGH THAT THE FALL WAS ALL THE HARDER NAY EVEN MORE HOPE HAD BECOME FRUITION TO HER WHEN THEY WERE ONCE A SHIPBOARD
7552-87290-0089 MADE IT DOUBLY HARD TO BEAR IT CRUSHED HER AND WHERE BEFORE HAD BEEN HOPE AND CONFIDENCE WAS NOTHING NOW BUT DESPAIR LIKE ALL PEOPLE WITH A GREAT CAPACITY FOR ELATION
7552-87290-0090 WHEN SHE SANK SHE TOUCHED THE BOTTOM ALAS MARY THE UNCONQUERABLE WAS DOWN AT LAST THIS FAILURE MEANT SO MUCH TO HER IT MEANT THAT SHE WOULD NEVER BE BRANDON'S WIFE BUT WOULD GO TO FRANCE TO ENDURE THE DREADED OLD FRENCHMAN
7552-87290-0091 AT THAT THOUGHT A RECOIL CAME HER SPIRIT ASSERTED ITSELF AND SHE STAMPED HER FOOT AND SWORE UPON HER SOUL IT SHOULD NEVER BE NEVER NEVER SO LONG AS SHE HAD STRENGTH TO FIGHT OR VOICE TO CRY NO
7552-87290-0092 BUT THERE CAME ANOTHER ENTIRELY NEW TO HER AND INFINITELY WORSE HASTILY ARRANGING HER DRESS SHE WENT IN SEARCH OF BRANDON WHOM SHE QUICKLY FOUND AND TOOK TO HER ROOM AFTER CLOSING THE DOOR SHE SAID
7552-87290-0093 I THOUGHT I HAD REACHED THE PINNACLE OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND PAIN WHEN COMPELLED TO LEAVE THE SHIP FOR IT MEANT THAT I SHOULD LOSE YOU AND HAVE TO MARRY LOUIS OF FRANCE BUT I HAVE FOUND THAT THERE IS STILL A POSSIBLE PAIN MORE POIGNANT THAN EITHER AND I CANNOT BEAR IT
7552-87290-0094 SO I COME TO YOU YOU WHO ARE THE GREAT CURE FOR ALL MY TROUBLES OH THAT I COULD LAY THEM HERE ALL MY LIFE LONG AND SHE PUT HER HEAD UPON HIS BREAST FORGETTING WHAT SHE HAD INTENDED TO SAY WHAT IS THE TROUBLE MARY
7552-87290-0095 OH YES I THOUGHT OF THAT MARRIAGE AND OF LOSING YOU AND THEN OH MARY MOTHER I THOUGHT OF SOME OTHER WOMAN HAVING YOU TO HERSELF I COULD SEE HER WITH YOU AND I WAS JEALOUS I THINK THEY CALL IT
7552-87290-0096 I HAVE HEARD OF THE PANGS OF JEALOUSY AND IF THE FEAR OF A RIVAL IS SO GREAT WHAT WOULD THE REALITY BE IT WOULD KILL ME I COULD NOT ENDURE IT I CANNOT ENDURE EVEN THIS AND I WANT YOU TO SWEAR THAT
7552-87290-0097 BRANDON TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS AS SHE BEGAN TO WEEP I WILL GLADLY SWEAR BY EVERYTHING I HOLD SACRED THAT NO OTHER WOMAN THAN YOU SHALL EVER BE MY WIFE IF I CANNOT HAVE YOU BE SURE YOU HAVE SPOILED EVERY OTHER WOMAN FOR ME
7552-87290-0098 THERE IS BUT ONE IN ALL THE WORLD BUT ONE I CAN AT LEAST SAVE YOU THAT PAIN SHE THEN STOOD ON TIP TOES TO LIFT HER LIPS TO HIM AND SAID I GIVE YOU THE SAME PROMISE
7552-87290-0099 BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORSE THAT IS IT WOULD BE WORSE IF YOU SHOULD MARRY SOME OTHER WOMAN BUT THAT IS ALL SETTLED NOW AND I FEEL EASIER THEN I MIGHT HAVE MARRIED THE OLD FRENCH KING BUT THAT TOO IS SETTLED
7552-87290-0100 IT ALWAYS HELPS US WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORSE HER UNQUESTIONING FAITH IN BRANDON WAS BEAUTIFUL AND SHE NEVER DOUBTED THAT HE SPOKE THE UNALTERABLE TRUTH
7552-87290-0101 WHEN HE SAID HE WOULD NEVER MARRY ANY OTHER WOMAN SHE HAD FAITH IN HERSELF TOO AND WAS CONFIDENT THAT HER PROMISE TO MARRY NO MAN BUT BRANDON ENDED THAT IMPORTANT MATTER LIKEWISE AND PUT THE FRENCH MARRIAGE TOTALLY OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR ALL TIME TO COME
7552-87290-0102 AS FOR BRANDON HE WAS SAFE ENOUGH IN HIS PART OF THE CONTRACT HE KNEW ONLY TOO WELL THAT NO WOMAN COULD APPROACH MARY IN HER INIMITABLE PERFECTIONS AND HE HAD TESTED HIS LOVE CLOSELY ENOUGH IN HIS STRUGGLE AGAINST IT
7552-87290-0103 WHETHER HE WANTED IT OR NOT HE KNEW THAT HE WAS SAFE IN MAKING HER A PROMISE WHICH HE WAS POWERLESS TO BREAK ALL THIS HE FULLY EXPLAINED TO MARY AS THEY SAT LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THE DREARY RAIN
7552-87290-0104 WHICH HAD COME ON AGAIN WITH THE GATHERING GLOOM OF NIGHT BRANDON DID NOT TELL HER THAT HIS FAITH IN HER ULTIMATE ABILITY TO KEEP HER PROMISE WAS AS SMALL AS IT WAS GREAT IN HIS OWN
7552-87290-0105 NEITHER DID HE DAMPEN HER SPIRITS BY TELLING HER THAT THERE WAS A REASON OUTSIDE OF HIMSELF WHICH IN ALL PROBABILITY WOULD HELP HIM IN KEEPING HIS WORD AND SAVE HER FROM THE PANGS OF THAT JEALOUSY SHE SO MUCH FEARED NAMELY
7552-87290-0106 THAT HE WOULD MOST CERTAINLY WED THE BLOCK AND AX SHOULD THE KING GET POSSESSION OF HIM
