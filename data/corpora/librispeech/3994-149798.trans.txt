3994-149798-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN UNDER THE GREAT DOME WHEN GLINDA THE GOOD AND HER FOLLOWERS OF THE RESCUE EXPEDITION CAME IN SIGHT OF THE ENCHANTED MOUNTAIN OF THE FLATHEADS
3994-149798-0001 IF WE GO TO THE MOUNTAIN SAID THE WIZARD WE MAY GET INTO TROUBLE WITH THAT WICKED SU DIC AND THEN WE WOULD BE DELAYED IN RESCUING OZMA AND DOROTHY SO I THINK OUR BEST PLAN WILL BE TO GO TO THE SKEEZER COUNTRY
3994-149798-0002 RAISE THE SUNKEN ISLAND AND SAVE OUR FRIENDS AND THE IMPRISONED SKEEZERS AFTERWARD WE CAN VISIT THE MOUNTAIN AND PUNISH THE CRUEL MAGICIAN OF THE FLATHEADS THAT IS SENSIBLE APPROVED THE SHAGGY MAN I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU
3994-149798-0003 THESE WERE SET CLOSELY TOGETHER THE BRANCHES WHICH CAME QUITE TO THE GROUND BEING SO TIGHTLY INTERLACED THAT EVEN THE GLASS CAT COULD SCARCELY FIND A PLACE TO SQUEEZE THROUGH THE PATH WHICH THE FLATHEADS USED WAS SOME DISTANCE AWAY
3994-149798-0004 HERE'S A JOB FOR THE TIN WOODMAN SAID THE SCARECROW SO THE TIN WOODMAN WHO WAS ALWAYS GLAD TO BE OF USE SET TO WORK WITH HIS SHARP GLEAMING AXE WHICH HE ALWAYS CARRIED
3994-149798-0005 FAR FROM SHORE AND DIRECTLY IN THE CENTER OF THE LAKE OF COURSE EVERY EYE WAS AT FIRST FIXED UPON THIS DOME WHERE OZMA AND DOROTHY AND THE SKEEZERS WERE STILL FAST PRISONERS BUT SOON THEIR ATTENTION WAS CAUGHT BY A MORE BRILLIANT SIGHT
3994-149798-0006 FOR HERE WAS THE DIAMOND SWAN SWIMMING JUST BEFORE THEM ITS LONG NECK ARCHED PROUDLY THE AMETHYST EYES GLEAMING AND ALL THE DIAMOND SPRINKLED FEATHERS GLISTENING SPLENDIDLY UNDER THE RAYS OF THE SUN THAT SAID GLINDA
3994-149798-0007 I AM SURE COO EE OH IS PUNISHED SAID GLINDA FOR SHE HAS LOST ALL HER MAGIC POWER AND HER GRAND PALACE AND CAN NO LONGER MISRULE THE POOR SKEEZERS
3994-149798-0008 PROPOSED THE WIZARD SO GLINDA BECKONED THE DIAMOND SWAN WHICH SWAM GRACEFULLY TO A POSITION NEAR THEM BEFORE ANYONE COULD SPEAK COO EE OH CALLED TO THEM IN A RASPING VOICE
3994-149798-0009 FOR THE VOICE OF A SWAN IS ALWAYS HARSH AND UNPLEASANT AND SAID WITH MUCH PRIDE
3994-149798-0010 HANDSOME IS AS HANDSOME DOES REPLIED THE SCARECROW
3994-149798-0011 DEEDS WHAT DEEDS CAN A SWAN DO BUT SWIM AROUND AND GIVE PLEASURE TO ALL BEHOLDERS SAID THE SPARKLING BIRD HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN YOUR FORMER LIFE HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN YOUR MAGIC AND WITCHCRAFT
3994-149798-0012 INQUIRED THE WIZARD
3994-149798-0013 I WOULDN'T GO BACK TO IT IF I COULD DON'T YOU ADMIRE MY BEAUTY STRANGERS TELL US COO EE OH
3994-149798-0014 SAID GLINDA EARNESTLY IF YOU CAN RECALL ENOUGH OF YOUR WITCHCRAFT TO ENABLE US TO RAISE THE SUNKEN ISLAND TO THE SURFACE OF THE LAKE TELL US THAT AND I'LL GIVE YOU A STRING OF PEARLS TO WEAR AROUND YOUR NECK AND ADD TO YOUR BEAUTY
3994-149798-0015 BUT HOW CAN WE RAISE THE ISLAND
3994-149798-0016 SAID BUTTON BRIGHT THE OLD SWAN IS TOO MUCH IN LOVE WITH HERSELF TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S A FACT AGREED BETSY WITH A SIGH
3994-149798-0017 ADDED THE SCARECROW BUT HOW ASKED UNCLE HENRY IN A GRAVE VOICE FOR HE COULD NOT BEAR TO THINK OF HIS DEAR NIECE DOROTHY BEING OUT THERE UNDER WATER HOW SHALL WE DO IT LEAVE THAT TO GLINDA
3994-149798-0018 IF IT WERE JUST AN ORDINARY SUNKEN ISLAND SAID THE POWERFUL SORCERESS THERE WOULD BE SEVERAL WAYS BY WHICH I MIGHT BRING IT TO THE SURFACE AGAIN BUT THIS IS A MAGIC ISLE
3994-149798-0019 IT OBEYS CERTAIN COMMANDS OF MAGIC AND WILL NOT RESPOND TO ANY OTHER I DO NOT DESPAIR IN THE LEAST BUT IT WILL REQUIRE SOME DEEP STUDY TO SOLVE THIS DIFFICULT PROBLEM
3994-149798-0020 THAT THERE ARE THREE FISHES IN THIS LAKE THAT USED TO BE ADEPTS AT MAGIC AND FROM WHOM COO EE OH STOLE MUCH OF HER KNOWLEDGE
3994-149798-0021 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND OF COURSE THAT HAD GLINDA BEEN AT HOME IN HER CASTLE WHERE THE GREAT BOOK OF RECORDS WAS SHE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT ERVIC THE SKEEZER ALREADY HAD TAKEN THE GOLD AND SILVER AND BRONZE FISHES FROM THE LAKE BUT THAT ACT HAD BEEN RECORDED IN THE BOOK
3994-149798-0022 AFTER GLINDA HAD SET OUT ON THIS JOURNEY SO IT WAS ALL UNKNOWN TO HER I THINK I SEE A BOAT YONDER ON THE SHORE SAID OJO THE MUNCHKIN BOY POINTING TO A PLACE AROUND THE EDGE OF THE LAKE
3994-149798-0023 IT WAS A MERE SHELL OF BLACKENED STEEL WITH A COLLAPSIBLE ROOF THAT WHEN IN POSITION MADE THE SUBMARINE WATERTIGHT BUT AT PRESENT THE ROOF RESTED IN SLOTS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE MAGIC CRAFT
3994-149798-0024 THERE WERE NO OARS OR SAILS NO MACHINERY TO MAKE THE BOAT GO AND ALTHOUGH GLINDA PROMPTLY REALIZED IT WAS MEANT TO BE OPERATED BY WITCHCRAFT SHE WAS NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THAT SORT OF MAGIC HOWEVER
3994-149798-0025 SAID SHE THE BOAT IS MERELY A BOAT AND I BELIEVE I CAN MAKE IT OBEY A COMMAND OF SORCERY AS WELL AS IT DID THE COMMAND OF WITCHCRAFT
3994-149798-0026 NOT ALL OF US RETURNED THE WIZARD
3994-149798-0027 BUT MOST NOBLE SORCERESS PROVIDED YOU CAN MAKE THE BOAT GO OF WHAT USE WILL IT BE TO US CAN'T WE USE IT
3994-149798-0028 WHAT I AM TRYING TO DISCOVER IS HOW THE BOAT CAME TO BE ON THIS SHORE WHILE THE ISLAND ON WHICH IT BELONGS IS UNDER WATER YONDER DID COO EE OH COME HERE IN THE BOAT TO MEET THE FLATHEADS BEFORE THE ISLAND WAS SUNK OR AFTERWARD
3994-149798-0029 FOR WE ARE IN GREAT TROUBLE AND NEED ASSISTANCE IF YOU BELONG ON THE ISLAND WHY ARE YOU HERE DEMANDED GLINDA SO THEY TOLD HER ALL THE STORY
3994-149798-0030 AND HOW THE BOAT HAD SHOT OUT FROM THE BASEMENT OF THE SUNKEN ISLE OBEYING A MAGIC WORD AND RISEN TO THE SURFACE WHERE IT OPENED AND FLOATED UPON THE WATER THEN FOLLOWED THE ACCOUNT OF HOW THE SU DIC
3994-149798-0031 WHILE THE BOAT IN SOME STRANGE MANNER HAD FLOATED TO THE SHORE AND STRANDED UPON THE BEACH THAT WAS ALL THEY KNEW THEY HAD SEARCHED IN VAIN FOR THREE DAYS FOR ERVIC AS THEIR ISLAND WAS UNDER WATER AND THEY COULD NOT GET BACK TO IT
3994-149798-0032 THE THREE SKEEZERS HAD NO PLACE TO GO AND SO HAD WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE THEIR BOAT FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN BEING QUESTIONED BY GLINDA AND THE WIZARD THEY TOLD ALL THEY KNEW ABOUT OZMA AND DOROTHY
3994-149798-0033 AND DECLARED THE TWO GIRLS WERE STILL IN THE VILLAGE UNDER THE GREAT DOME THEY WERE QUITE SAFE AND WOULD BE WELL CARED FOR BY LADY AUREX NOW THAT THE QUEEN WHO OPPOSED THEM WAS OUT OF THE WAY WHEN THEY HAD GLEANED ALL THE INFORMATION THEY COULD FROM THESE SKEEZERS
3994-149798-0034 THE WIZARD SAID TO GLINDA IF YOU FIND YOU CAN MAKE THIS BOAT OBEY YOUR SORCERY YOU COULD HAVE IT RETURN TO THE ISLAND SUBMERGE ITSELF AND ENTER THE DOOR IN THE BASEMENT FROM WHICH IT CAME BUT I CANNOT SEE THAT OUR GOING TO THE SUNKEN ISLAND WOULD ENABLE OUR FRIENDS TO ESCAPE
3994-149798-0035 BUT WHAT COULD THEY DO THEN INQUIRED ANOTHER SKEEZER THEY WOULD HAVE NO HOMES AND NO PLACE TO GO AND WOULD BE AT THE MERCY OF THEIR ENEMIES THE FLATHEADS THAT IS TRUE SAID GLINDA THE GOOD
3994-149798-0036 I THINK SHE WOULD REFUSE TO ESCAPE WITH DOROTHY AND LEAVE THE OTHERS BEHIND OR TO ABANDON THE ISLAND WHICH IS THE LAWFUL HOME OF THE SKEEZERS I BELIEVE THE BEST PLAN WILL BE TO SUMMON THE THREE FISHES AND LEARN FROM THEM HOW TO RAISE THE ISLAND
