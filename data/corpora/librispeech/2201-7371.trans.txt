2201-7371-0000 OF DRAWBACKS MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS ARE NOT CONTENTED WITH THE MONOPOLY OF THE HOME MARKET BUT DESIRE LIKEWISE THE MOST EXTENSIVE FOREIGN SALE FOR THEIR GOODS
2201-7371-0001 SUCH ENCOURAGEMENTS DO NOT TEND TO TURN TOWARDS ANY PARTICULAR EMPLOYMENT A GREATER SHARE OF THE CAPITAL OF THE COUNTRY THAN WHAT WOULD GO TO THAT EMPLOYMENT OF ITS OWN ACCORD BUT ONLY TO HINDER THE DUTY FROM DRIVING AWAY ANY PART OF THAT SHARE TO OTHER EMPLOYMENTS
2201-7371-0002 WHAT IT IS IN MOST CASES ADVANTAGEOUS TO PRESERVE THE NATURAL DIVISION AND DISTRIBUTION OF LABOUR IN THE SOCIETY THE SAME THING MAY BE SAID OF THE DRAWBACKS UPON THE RE EXPORTATION OF FOREIGN GOODS IMPORTED
2201-7371-0003 WHICH IN GREAT BRITAIN GENERALLY AMOUNT TO BY MUCH THE LARGEST PART OF THE DUTY UPON IMPORTATION BY THE SECOND OF THE RULES ANNEXED TO THE ACT OF PARLIAMENT WHICH IMPOSED WHAT IS NOW CALLED THE OLD SUBSIDY EVERY MERCHANT WHETHER ENGLISH OR ALIEN
2201-7371-0004 WAS ALLOWED TO DRAW BACK HALF THAT DUTY UPON EXPORTATION THE ENGLISH MERCHANT PROVIDED THE EXPORTATION TOOK PLACE WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS THE ALIEN PROVIDED IT TOOK PLACE WITHIN NINE MONTHS
2201-7371-0005 WINES CURRANTS AND WROUGHT SILKS WERE THE ONLY GOODS WHICH DID NOT FALL WITHIN THIS RULE
2201-7371-0006 WHOLLY DRAWN BACK UPON EXPORTATION THIS GENERAL RULE HOWEVER IS LIABLE TO A GREAT NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS AND THE DOCTRINE OF DRAWBACKS HAS BECOME A MUCH LESS SIMPLE MATTER THAN IT WAS AT THEIR FIRST INSTITUTION
2201-7371-0007 UPON THE EXPORTATION OF SOME FOREIGN GOODS OF WHICH IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THE IMPORTATION WOULD GREATLY EXCEED WHAT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE HOME CONSUMPTION THE WHOLE DUTIES ARE DRAWN BACK WITHOUT RETAINING EVEN HALF THE OLD SUBSIDY
2201-7371-0008 TO FACILITATE THE GREAT EXPORTATION WHICH WAS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO RID US OF THE REST THE WHOLE DUTIES WERE DRAWN BACK PROVIDED THE EXPORTATION TOOK PLACE WITHIN THREE YEARS WE STILL HAVE THOUGH NOT ALTOGETHER YET VERY NEARLY
2201-7371-0009 THE MONOPOLY OF THE SUGARS OF OUR WEST INDIAN ISLANDS IF SUGARS ARE EXPORTED WITHIN A YEAR THEREFORE ALL THE DUTIES UPON IMPORTATION ARE DRAWN BACK AND IF EXPORTED WITHIN THREE YEARS
2201-7371-0010 ALL THE DUTIES EXCEPT HALF THE OLD SUBSIDY WHICH STILL CONTINUES TO BE RETAINED UPON THE EXPORTATION OF THE GREATER PART OF GOODS THOUGH THE IMPORTATION OF SUGAR EXCEEDS A GOOD DEAL WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR THE HOME CONSUMPTION
2201-7371-0011 THE EXCESS IS INCONSIDERABLE IN COMPARISON OF WHAT IT USED TO BE IN TOBACCO SOME GOODS THE PARTICULAR OBJECTS OF THE JEALOUSY OF OUR OWN MANUFACTURERS ARE PROHIBITED TO BE IMPORTED FOR HOME CONSUMPTION THEY MAY HOWEVER UPON PAYING CERTAIN DUTIES
2201-7371-0012 AND ARE AFRAID LEST SOME PART OF THESE GOODS SHOULD BE STOLEN OUT OF THE WAREHOUSE AND THUS COME INTO COMPETITION WITH THEIR OWN IT IS UNDER THESE REGULATIONS ONLY THAT WE CAN IMPORT WROUGHT SILKS FRENCH CAMBRICS AND LAWNS
2201-7371-0013 CALICOES PAINTED PRINTED STAINED OR DYED ET CETERA WE ARE UNWILLING EVEN TO BE THE CARRIERS OF FRENCH GOODS AND CHOOSE RATHER TO FOREGO A PROFIT TO OURSELVES THAN TO SUFFER THOSE WHOM WE CONSIDER AS OUR ENEMIES TO MAKE ANY PROFIT BY OUR MEANS
2201-7371-0014 NOT ONLY HALF THE OLD SUBSIDY BUT THE SECOND TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IS RETAINED UPON THE EXPORTATION OF ALL FRENCH GOODS BY THE FOURTH OF THE RULES ANNEXED TO THE OLD SUBSIDY
2201-7371-0015 AND IT SEEMS AT THAT TIME TO HAVE BEEN THE OBJECT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO GIVE SOMEWHAT MORE THAN ORDINARY ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE CARRYING TRADE IN WINE SEVERAL OF THE OTHER DUTIES TOO WHICH WERE IMPOSED EITHER AT THE SAME TIME OR SUBSEQUENT TO THE OLD SUBSIDY
2201-7371-0016 WHAT IS CALLED THE ADDITIONAL DUTY THE NEW SUBSIDY THE ONE THIRD AND TWO THIRDS SUBSIDIES THE IMPOST SIXTEEN NINETY TWO THE TONNAGE ON WINE WERE ALLOWED TO BE WHOLLY DRAWN BACK UPON EXPORTATION
2201-7371-0017 ALL THOSE DUTIES HOWEVER EXCEPT THE ADDITIONAL DUTY AND IMPOST SIXTEEN NINETY TWO BEING PAID DOWN IN READY MONEY UPON IMPORTATION THE INTEREST OF SO LARGE A SUM OCCASIONED AN EXPENSE
2201-7371-0018 IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY THREE AND IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WERE ALLOWED TO BE DRAWN BACK UPON EXPORTATION THE TWO IMPOSTS OF FIVE PER CENT IMPOSED IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTY ONE UPON ALL THE FORMER DUTIES OF CUSTOMS
2201-7371-0019 BEING ALLOWED TO BE WHOLLY DRAWN BACK UPON THE EXPORTATION OF ALL OTHER GOODS WERE LIKEWISE ALLOWED TO BE DRAWN BACK UPON THAT OF WINE THE LAST DUTY THAT HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY IMPOSED UPON WINE THAT OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY IS ALLOWED TO BE WHOLLY DRAWN BACK
2201-7371-0020 AN INDULGENCE WHICH WHEN SO MANY HEAVY DUTIES ARE RETAINED MOST PROBABLY COULD NEVER OCCASION THE EXPORTATION OF A SINGLE TON OF WINE THESE RULES TOOK PLACE WITH REGARD TO ALL PLACES OF LAWFUL EXPORTATION EXCEPT THE BRITISH COLONIES IN AMERICA
2201-7371-0021 IN A COUNTRY OF SO EXTENSIVE A COAST AS OUR NORTH AMERICAN AND WEST INDIAN COLONIES WHERE OUR AUTHORITY WAS ALWAYS SO VERY SLENDER AND WHERE THE INHABITANTS WERE ALLOWED TO CARRY OUT IN THEIR OWN SHIPS THEIR NON ENUMERATED COMMODITIES
2201-7371-0022 AT FIRST TO ALL PARTS OF EUROPE AND AFTERWARDS TO ALL PARTS OF EUROPE SOUTH OF CAPE FINISTERRE IT IS NOT VERY PROBABLE THAT THIS MONOPOLY COULD EVER BE MUCH RESPECTED
2201-7371-0023 MADEIRA WINE NOT BEING AN EUROPEAN COMMODITY COULD BE IMPORTED DIRECTLY INTO AMERICA AND THE WEST INDIES COUNTRIES WHICH IN ALL THEIR NON ENUMERATED COMMODITIES ENJOYED A FREE TRADE TO THE ISLAND OF MADEIRA
2201-7371-0024 THESE CIRCUMSTANCES HAD PROBABLY INTRODUCED THAT GENERAL TASTE FOR MADEIRA WINE WHICH OUR OFFICERS FOUND ESTABLISHED IN ALL OUR COLONIES AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE WAR WHICH BEGAN IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY FIVE AND WHICH THEY BROUGHT BACK WITH THEM TO THE MOTHER COUNTRY
2201-7371-0025 WAS PROBABLY TOO SHORT TO ADMIT OF ANY CONSIDERABLE CHANGE IN THE CUSTOMS OF THOSE COUNTRIES THE SAME ACT WHICH IN THE DRAWBACKS UPON ALL WINES EXCEPT FRENCH WINES THUS FAVOURED THE COLONIES SO MUCH MORE THAN OTHER COUNTRIES
2201-7371-0026 IN THOSE UPON THE GREATER PART OF OTHER COMMODITIES FAVOURED THEM MUCH LESS UPON THE EXPORTATION OF THE GREATER PART OF COMMODITIES TO OTHER COUNTRIES HALF THE OLD SUBSIDY WAS DRAWN BACK
2201-7371-0027 BUT THIS LAW ENACTED THAT NO PART OF THAT DUTY SHOULD BE DRAWN BACK UPON THE EXPORTATION TO THE COLONIES OF ANY COMMODITIES OF THE GROWTH OR MANUFACTURE EITHER OF EUROPE OR THE EAST INDIES EXCEPT WINES WHITE CALICOES AND MUSLINS
2201-7371-0028 DRAWBACKS WERE PERHAPS ORIGINALLY GRANTED FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE CARRYING TRADE WHICH AS THE FREIGHT OF THE SHIP IS FREQUENTLY PAID BY FOREIGNERS IN MONEY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PECULIARLY FITTED FOR BRINGING GOLD AND SILVER INTO THE COUNTRY
2201-7371-0029 SUCH DRAWBACKS CANNOT FORCE INTO THIS TRADE A GREATER SHARE OF THE CAPITAL OF THE COUNTRY THAN WHAT WOULD HAVE GONE TO IT OF ITS OWN ACCORD HAD THERE BEEN NO DUTIES UPON IMPORTATION THEY ONLY PREVENT ITS BEING EXCLUDED ALTOGETHER BY THOSE DUTIES
2201-7371-0030 THE CARRYING TRADE THOUGH IT DESERVES NO PREFERENCE OUGHT NOT TO BE PRECLUDED BUT TO BE LEFT FREE LIKE ALL OTHER TRADES IT IS A NECESSARY RESOURCE TO THOSE CAPITALS WHICH CANNOT FIND EMPLOYMENT EITHER IN THE AGRICULTURE
2201-7371-0031 OR IN THE MANUFACTURES OF THE COUNTRY EITHER IN ITS HOME TRADE OR IN ITS FOREIGN TRADE OF CONSUMPTION THE REVENUE OF THE CUSTOMS INSTEAD OF SUFFERING PROFITS FROM SUCH DRAWBACKS BY THAT PART OF THE DUTY WHICH IS RETAINED
2201-7371-0032 IF THE WHOLE DUTIES HAD BEEN RETAINED THE FOREIGN GOODS UPON WHICH THEY ARE PAID COULD SELDOM HAVE BEEN EXPORTED NOR CONSEQUENTLY IMPORTED FOR WANT OF A MARKET THE DUTIES THEREFORE OF WHICH A PART IS RETAINED WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN PAID
2201-7371-0033 THESE REASONS SEEM SUFFICIENTLY TO JUSTIFY DRAWBACKS AND WOULD JUSTIFY THEM THOUGH THE WHOLE DUTIES WHETHER UPON THE PRODUCE OF DOMESTIC INDUSTRY OR UPON FOREIGN GOODS WERE ALWAYS DRAWN BACK UPON EXPORTATION
2201-7371-0034 THE REVENUE OF EXCISE WOULD IN THIS CASE INDEED SUFFER A LITTLE AND THAT OF THE CUSTOMS A GOOD DEAL MORE BUT THE NATURAL BALANCE OF INDUSTRY THE NATURAL DIVISION AND DISTRIBUTION OF LABOUR WHICH IS ALWAYS MORE OR LESS DISTURBED BY SUCH DUTIES
2201-7371-0035 WOULD BE MORE NEARLY RE ESTABLISHED BY SUCH A REGULATION THESE REASONS HOWEVER WILL JUSTIFY DRAWBACKS ONLY UPON EXPORTING GOODS TO THOSE COUNTRIES WHICH ARE ALTOGETHER FOREIGN AND INDEPENDENT NOT TO THOSE IN WHICH OUR MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS
2201-7371-0036 ENJOY A MONOPOLY A DRAWBACK FOR EXAMPLE UPON THE EXPORTATION OF EUROPEAN GOODS TO OUR AMERICAN COLONIES WILL NOT ALWAYS OCCASION A GREATER EXPORTATION THAN WHAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE WITHOUT IT
2201-7371-0037 BY MEANS OF THE MONOPOLY WHICH OUR MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS ENJOY THERE THE SAME QUANTITY MIGHT FREQUENTLY PERHAPS BE SENT THITHER THOUGH THE WHOLE DUTIES WERE RETAINED THE DRAWBACK THEREFORE MAY FREQUENTLY BE PURE LOSS TO THE REVENUE OF EXCISE AND CUSTOMS
2201-7371-0038 WITHOUT ALTERING THE STATE OF THE TRADE OR RENDERING IT IN ANY RESPECT MORE EXTENSIVE HOW FAR SUCH DRAWBACKS CAN BE JUSTIFIED AS A PROPER ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE INDUSTRY OF OUR COLONIES
2201-7371-0039 OR HOW FAR IT IS ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE MOTHER COUNTRY THAT THEY SHOULD BE EXEMPTED FROM TAXES WHICH ARE PAID BY ALL THE REST OF THEIR FELLOW SUBJECTS WILL APPEAR HEREAFTER WHEN I COME TO TREAT OF COLONIES
2201-7371-0040 DRAWBACKS HOWEVER IT MUST ALWAYS BE UNDERSTOOD ARE USEFUL ONLY IN THOSE CASES IN WHICH THE GOODS FOR THE EXPORTATION OF WHICH THEY ARE GIVEN ARE REALLY EXPORTED TO SOME FOREIGN COUNTRY AND NOT CLANDESTINELY RE IMPORTED INTO OUR OWN
