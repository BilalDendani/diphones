7423-89164-0000 I READ THE PARTICULARS BREATHLESSLY DARING BURGLARY IN HAMPSTEAD LADY LOSES TWO THOUSAND POUNDS WORTH OF JEWELRY THE BURGLARY HAD TAKEN PLACE AT THE HOUSE OF A MISTER AND MISSUS SAMUELSON IN WOOD GROVE HAMPSTEAD
7423-89164-0001 WHICH HAD ENGAGED THE ATTENTION OF THE WHOLE OF THE STAFF OF FOUR SERVANTS AND THAT FOR AN HOUR OR SO
7423-89164-0002 THE PARAGRAPH EVEN CONCLUDED WITHOUT THE USUAL FORMULA AS TO THE POLICE HAVING A CLEW ON THE WHOLE I PUT THE PAPER DOWN WITH A SLIGHT FEELING OF RELIEF I FELT THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORSE
7423-89164-0003 I BREAKFASTED AT NINE O'CLOCK AFTER HAVING READ THE ANNOUNCEMENT THROUGH AGAIN TRYING TO SEE WHETHER THERE WAS ANY POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN IT AND MY FRIENDS THEN I LIT A PIPE
7423-89164-0004 AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT UNTIL I COULD RING UP THIRTY SEVEN SEVENTY ONE A GERRARD ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK HOWEVER MY OWN TELEPHONE BELL RANG AND I WAS INFORMED THAT A GENTLEMAN WHO DESIRED TO SEE ME WAS WAITING BELOW
7423-89164-0005 I TOLD THE MAN TO SEND HIM UP AND IN A MOMENT OR TWO THERE WAS A KNOCK AT MY DOOR IN RESPONSE TO MY INVITATION TO ENTER A SHORT DARK JEWISH LOOKING PERSON WITH OLIVE COMPLEXION
7423-89164-0006 SHINY BLACK HAIR AND BLACK MUSTACHE PRESENTED HIMSELF HE CARRIED A VERY IMMACULATE SILK HAT AND WAS DRESSED WITH GREAT NEATNESS HE HAD THE AIR HOWEVER OF A MAN WHO IS SUFFERING FROM SOME AGITATION
7423-89164-0007 MISTER WALMSLEY I BELIEVE HE ASKED MISTER PAUL WALMSLEY THAT IS MY NAME KNOW YOU BY HEARSAY QUITE WELL SIR MY VISITOR ASSURED ME WITH A FLASH OF HIS WHITE TEETH

7423-89164-0010 I WHEELED AN EASY CHAIR UP FOR HIM AND PLACED A BOX OF CIGARETTES AT HIS ELBOW QUITE A MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR I CONTINUED
7423-89164-0011 ANY CLEW AT ALL I ASKED RATHER HARD TO SAY MISTER SAMUELSON REPLIED YOU'LL BE WONDERING WHAT I'VE COME TO SEE YOU ABOUT WELL I'LL JUST EXPLAIN OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT SOME ONE MAY HAVE ENTERED THE HOUSE WHILE WE WERE ALL AT DINNER
7423-89164-0012 CREPT UPSTAIRS QUIETLY AND GOT AWAY WITH THE JEWEL CASE BUT THIS JOHNNY I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT FROM SCOTLAND YARD SEEMS TO HAVE GOT HOLD OF A THEORY THAT HAS RATHER KNOCKED ME OF A HEAP VERY DELICATE MATTER MISTER SAMUELSON CONTINUED
7423-89164-0013 SEEMS A LITTLE FAR FETCHED TO ME I REMARKED BUT ONE NEVER KNOWS YOU SEE MISTER SAMUELSON EXPLAINED THERE'S NO BACK EXIT FROM MY HOUSE WITHOUT CLIMBING WALLS AND THAT SORT OF THING
