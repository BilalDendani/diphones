3547-156969-0000 JEHOVAH SAID TO ABRAHAM GO FORTH FROM THY COUNTRY AND FROM THY KINDRED AND FROM THY FATHER'S HOUSE TO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW THEE
3547-156969-0001 AND I WILL SURELY BLESS THEE AND MAKE THY NAME GREAT SO THAT THOU SHALT BE A BLESSING I WILL ALSO BLESS THEM THAT BLESS THEE
3547-156969-0002 SO THAT ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH SHALL ASK FOR THEMSELVES A BLESSING LIKE THINE OWN SO ABRAHAM WENT FORTH
3547-156969-0003 BY FAITH ABRAHAM WHEN HE WAS CALLED OBEYED TO GO OUT INTO A PLACE WHICH HE WAS TO RECEIVE FOR AN INHERITANCE AND HE WENT OUT NOT KNOWING WHITHER HE WENT BY FAITH HE BECAME A SOJOURNER IN THE LAND OF PROMISE AS IN A LAND NOT HIS OWN
3547-156969-0004 HE THAT FINDETH HIS LIFE SHALL LOSE IT
3547-156969-0005 AND IS TOLD NOT OF ABRAHAM BUT OF ISAAC WHOSE CHARACTER IT FITS FAR MORE CONSISTENTLY SIMILARLY THERE ARE THREE ACCOUNTS OF THE COVENANT WITH ABIMELECH
3547-156969-0006 DIFFER RATHER WIDELY IN DETAILS IN ONE ACCOUNT HAGAR IS EXPELLED AND ISHMAEL IS BORN AFTER THE BIRTH OF ISAAC AND IN THE OTHER BEFORE THAT EVENT DO THESE VARIANT VERSIONS INDICATE THAT THEY WERE DRAWN FROM DIFFERENT GROUPS OF NARRATIVES
3547-156969-0007 FINDS IN THE DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OF THE SAME EVENTS OR TEACHINGS IN THE LIFE OF JESUS THEY SUGGEST TO MANY THAT THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK OF GENESIS WAS EAGER TO PRESERVE EACH AND EVERY STORY REGARDING ABRAHAM
3547-156969-0008 AS IN THE CASE OF THE GOSPELS THEY HAVE BEEN COMBINED WITH GREAT SKILL SOMETIMES AS IN THE CASE OF THE EXPULSION OF HAGAR THE TWO VERSIONS ARE INTRODUCED AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN THE LIFE OF THE PATRIARCH MORE COMMONLY THE TWO OR MORE VERSIONS ARE CLOSELY INTERWOVEN
3547-156969-0009 GIVING A COMPOSITE NARRATIVE THAT CLOSELY RESEMBLES TATIAN'S DIATESSARON WHICH WAS ONE CONTINUOUS NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE AND TEACHINGS OF JESUS BASED ON QUOTATIONS FROM EACH OF THE FOUR GOSPELS FORTUNATELY IF THIS THEORY IS RIGHT
3547-156969-0010 THE GROUP OF STORIES MOST FULLY QUOTED AND THEREFORE BEST PRESERVED IS THE EARLY JUDEAN PROPHETIC NARRATIVES WHEN THESE ARE SEPARATED FROM THE LATER PARALLELS THEY GIVE A MARVELOUSLY COMPLETE AND CONSISTENT PORTRAIT OF ABRAHAM TWO
3547-156969-0011 THE MEANING OF THE EARLY PROPHETIC STORIES ABOUT ABRAHAM READ THE PROPHETIC STORIES REGARDING ABRAHAM
3547-156969-0012 LIKE THE STORY OF THE GARDEN OF EDEN DO THEY HAVE A DEEPER A MORE UNIVERSAL MORAL AND RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE BACK OF THE STORY OF ABRAHAM'S CALL AND SETTLEMENT IN CANAAN CLEARLY LIES THE HISTORIC FACT THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE HEBREWS AS NOMADS
3547-156969-0013 MIGRATED FROM THE LAND OF ARAM TO SEEK FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR DESCENDANTS A PERMANENT HOME IN THE LAND OF CANAAN ABRAHAM WHOSE NAME IN HEBREW MEANS EXALTED FATHER OR AS IT WAS LATER INTERPRETED FATHER OF A MULTITUDE
3547-156969-0014 FOUR FOR THOSE WHO WILL BE LED BY HIM GOD HAS IN STORE A NOBLE DESTINY FIVE BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS FOR THEY SHALL BE CALLED THE CHILDREN OF GOD SIX BLESSED ARE THE MEEK FOR THEY SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH
3547-156969-0015 IT IS EVIDENT THAT LIKE THE OPENING NARRATIVES OF GENESIS THIS STORY AIMED TO EXPLAIN EXISTING CONDITIONS AS WELL AS TO ILLUSTRATE THE DEEPER TRUTHS OF LIFE SIMILARLY THE STORY OF THE EXPULSION OF HAGAR IT IS THOUGHT AIMS PRIMARILY
3547-156969-0016 THE NOMADIC ISHMAELITES WHO LIVED SOUTH OF CANAAN IN THE INSCRIPTIONS OF THE ASSYRIAN KING
3547-156969-0017 HARGARANU IS THE NAME OF AN ARAMEAN TRIBE A TRIBE BEARING A SIMILAR NAME IS ALSO MENTIONED IN THE SOUTH ARABIAN INSCRIPTIONS THE HAGAR OF THE STORY IS A TYPICAL DAUGHTER OF THE DESERT WHEN SHE BECAME THE MOTHER OF A CHILD
3547-156969-0018 THE HIGHEST HONOR THAT COULD COME TO A SEMITIC WOMAN SHE COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO TAUNT SARAH
3547-156969-0019 FOR IN THE EYE OF THE LAW THE SLAVE WIFE WAS HER PROPERTY THE TRADITION OF THE REVELATION TO HAGAR ALSO REPRESENTED THE POPULAR EXPLANATION OF THE SANCTITY OF THE FAMOUS DESERT SHRINE BEER LAHAL ROI
3547-156969-0020 LIKE MOST OF THE PROPHETIC STORIES THIS NARRATIVE TEACHES DEEPER MORAL LESSONS CHIEF AMONG THESE IS THE BROAD TRUTH THAT THE SPHERE OF GOD'S CARE
3547-156969-0021 TO THE OUTCAST AND NEEDY HE EVER COMES WITH HIS MESSAGE OF COUNSEL AND PROMISE WAS ABRAHAM RIGHT OR WRONG IN YIELDING TO SARAH'S WISH WAS SARAH RIGHT OR WRONG IN HER ATTITUDE TOWARD HAGAR
3547-156969-0022 WAS HAGAR'S TRIUMPHAL ATTITUDE TOWARD SARAH NATURAL WAS IT RIGHT IN THE STORY OF THE DESTRUCTION OF SODOM LOT APPEARS AS THE CENTRAL FIGURE HIS CHOICE OF THE FERTILE PLAIN OF THE JORDAN
3547-156969-0023 HAD BROUGHT HIM INTO CLOSE CONTACT WITH ITS INHABITANTS THE CANAANITES ABANDONING HIS NOMADIC LIFE HE HAD BECOME A CITIZEN OF THE CORRUPT CITY OF SODOM WHEN AT LAST JEHOVAH HAD DETERMINED TO DESTROY THE CITY BECAUSE OF ITS WICKEDNESS
3547-156969-0024 ABRAHAM PERSISTENTLY INTERCEDED THAT IT BE SPARED ITS WICKEDNESS PROVED HOWEVER TOO GREAT FOR PARDON LOT WHO TRUE TO HIS NOMAD TRAINING HOSPITABLY RECEIVED THE DIVINE MESSENGERS
3547-156969-0025 WAS FINALLY PERSUADED TO FLEE FROM THE CITY AND THUS ESCAPED THE OVERWHELMING DESTRUCTION THAT FELT UPON IT WHAT WAS THE POSSIBLE ORIGIN OF THIS STORY
3547-156969-0026 WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS OF THIS STORY WERE GREAT CALAMITIES IN THE PAST USUALLY THE RESULT OF WICKEDNESS ARE THEY TO DAY DO PEOPLE SO INTERPRET THE DESTRUCTION OF SAN FRANCISCO AND MESSINA
3547-156969-0027 THE GREAT EPIDEMIC OF CHOLERA IN HAMBURG IN EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO
3547-156969-0028 AT THAT DATE THE CHOLERA GERM HAD NOT BEEN CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND THERE WAS SOME DOUBT REGARDING THE MEANS BY WHICH THE DISEASE WAS SPREAD WAS SANITARY NEGLECT THEN AS MUCH OF A SIN AS IT WOULD BE NOW
3547-156969-0029 WHY DID THE PROPHETS PRESERVE THE STORY OF THE SACRIFICES OF ISAAC COMPARE THE PARALLEL TEACHING IN MICAH
3547-156969-0030 WITH WHAT SHALL I COME BEFORE JEHOVAH BOW MYSELF BEFORE THE GOD ON HIGH SHALL I COME BEFORE HIM WITH BURNT OFFERINGS WITH CALVES A YEAR OLD WILL JEHOVAH BE PLEASED WITH THOUSANDS OF RAMS
3547-156969-0031 WITH MYRIADS OF STREAMS OF OIL SHALL I GIVE HIM MY FIRST BORN FOR MY GUILT THE FRUIT OF MY BODY FOR THE SIN OF MY SOUL WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TEACHING OF THE STORY THE IMPORTANCE OF AN UNQUESTIONING FAITH AND OBEDIENCE
3547-156969-0032 OR THE NEEDLESSNESS OF HUMAN SACRIFICE DOES GOD EVER COMMAND ANY PERSON TO DO ANYTHING THAT THE PERSON THINKS WRONG THREE THE PROPHETIC PORTRAIT OF ABRAHAM IN THE SO CALLED LATER PRIESTLY STORIES REGARDING ABRAHAM
3547-156969-0033 HE IS PORTRAYED AS A DEVOTED SERVANT OF THE LAW CHIEFLY INTENT UPON OBSERVING THE SIMPLE CEREMONIAL INSTITUTIONS REVEALED TO HIM IN THAT PRIMITIVE AGE WITH HIM THE LATER PRIESTS ASSOCIATED THE ORIGIN OF THE DISTINCTIVE RITE OF CIRCUMCISION
3547-156969-0034 IN GENESIS FOURTEEN ABRAHAM IS PICTURED AS A VALIANT WARRIOR WHO ESPOUSED THE CAUSE OF THE WEAK AND WON A GREAT VICTORY OVER THE UNITED ARMIES OF THE EASTERN KINGS
3547-156969-0035 HE RESTORED THE CAPTURED SPOIL TO THE CITY THAT HAD BEEN ROBBED AND GAVE A LIBERAL PORTION TO THE PRIEST KING MELCHIZEDEK WHO APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN REGARDED IN LATER JEWISH TRADITION AS THE FORERUNNER OF THE JERUSALEM PRIESTHOOD
3547-156969-0036 IN THE STILL LATER JEWISH TRADITIONS OF WHICH MANY HAVE BEEN PRESERVED HE IS PICTURED SOMETIMES AS AN INVINCIBLE WARRIOR BEFORE WHOM EVEN THE GREAT CITY OF DAMASCUS FELL SOMETIMES AS AN ARDENT FOE OF IDOLATRY
3547-156969-0037 THE INCARNATION OF THE SPIRIT OF LATER JUDAISM OR ELSE HE IS THOUGHT OF AS HAVING BEEN BORNE TO HEAVEN ON A FIERY CHARIOT WHERE HE RECEIVES TO HIS BOSOM THE FAITHFUL OF HIS RACE THUS EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION OR GROUP OF WRITERS MADE ABRAHAM
3547-156969-0038 AS THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF THEIR RACE THE EMBODIMENT OF THEIR HIGHEST IDEALS THE ABRAHAM OF THE EARLY PROPHETIC NARRATIVES HOWEVER IS A REMARKABLY CONSISTENT CHARACTER HE EXEMPLIFIES THAT WHICH IS NOBLEST IN ISRAEL'S
3547-156969-0039 EARLY IDEALS HOW IS ABRAHAM'S FAITH ILLUSTRATED IN THE PROPHETIC STORIES CONSIDERED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH HIS UNSELFISHNESS AND GENEROSITY HIS COURTLY HOSPITALITY WAS HIS POLITENESS TO STRANGERS SIMPLY DUE TO HIS TRAINING
3547-156969-0040 AND THE TRADITIONS OF THE DESERT OR WAS IT THE EXPRESSION OF HIS NATURAL IMPULSES WAS ABRAHAM'S DEVOTED INTEREST IN THE FUTURE OF HIS DESCENDANTS A NOBLE QUALITY HOW ARE HIS DEVOTION AND OBEDIENCE TO GOD ILLUSTRATED
