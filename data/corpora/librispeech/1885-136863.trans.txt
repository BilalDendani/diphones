1885-136863-0000 AND AN ACCOUNT WHICH HE GAVE IN THE GENTLEMEN'S MAGAZINE OF MISTER TYTLER'S ACUTE AND ABLE VINDICATION OF MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS THE GENEROSITY OF JOHNSON'S FEELINGS SHINES FORTH IN THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE
1885-136863-0001 IT HAS NOW BEEN FASHIONABLE FOR NEAR HALF A CENTURY TO DEFAME AND VILIFY THE HOUSE OF STUART AND TO EXALT AND MAGNIFY THE REIGN OF ELIZABETH THE STUARTS HAVE FOUND FEW APOLOGISTS
1885-136863-0002 FOR THE DEAD CANNOT PAY FOR PRAISE AND WHO WILL WITHOUT REWARD OPPOSE THE TIDE OF POPULARITY
1885-136863-0003 A ZEAL FOR TRUTH A DESIRE OF ESTABLISHING RIGHT IN OPPOSITION TO FASHION
1885-136863-0004 I HAVE NOT DISCOVERED A SINGLE PRIVATE LETTER WRITTEN BY HIM TO ANY OF HIS FRIENDS IT SHOULD SEEM HOWEVER
1885-136863-0005 THAT HE HAD AT THIS PERIOD A FLOATING INTENTION OF WRITING A HISTORY OF THE RECENT AND WONDERFUL SUCCESSES OF THE BRITISH ARMS IN ALL QUARTERS OF THE GLOBE FOR AMONG HIS RESOLUTIONS OR MEMORANDUMS SEPTEMBER EIGHTEENTH
1885-136863-0006 SEND FOR BOOKS FOR HIST OF WAR
1885-136863-0007 WAS NOT FULFILLED HIS MAJESTICK EXPRESSION WOULD HAVE CARRIED DOWN TO THE LATEST POSTERITY THE GLORIOUS ACHIEVEMENTS OF HIS COUNTRY WITH THE SAME FERVENT GLOW WHICH THEY PRODUCED ON THE MIND OF THE TIME
1885-136863-0008 AND CONSECRATED LIES FOR INSTANCE WE ARE TOLD THAT ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE NEWS OF THE UNFORTUNATE BATTLE OF FONTENOY EVERY HEART BEAT AND EVERY EYE WAS IN TEARS NOW WE KNOW
1885-136863-0009 HAVE BEEN ALL THIS CONCERN AND TO SAY THERE WAS
1885-136863-0010 MAY BE RECKONED A CONSECRATED LIE
1885-136863-0011 THIS YEAR MISTER MURPHY HAVING THOUGHT HIMSELF ILL TREATED BY THE REVEREND DOCTOR FRANCKLIN WHO WAS ONE OF THE WRITERS OF THE CRITICAL REVIEW PUBLISHED AN INDIGNANT VINDICATION IN
1885-136863-0012 A POETICAL EPISTLE TO SAMUEL JOHNSON A M IN WHICH HE COMPLIMENTS JOHNSON IN A JUST AND ELEGANT MANNER
1885-136863-0013 TRANSCENDANT GENIUS WHOSE PROLIFIC VEIN NE'ER KNEW THE FRIGID POET'S TOIL AND PAIN TO WHOM APOLLO OPENS ALL HIS STORE AND EVERY MUSE PRESENTS HER SACRED LORE SAY POW'RFUL JOHNSON
1885-136863-0014 WHENCE THY VERSE IS FRAUGHT WITH SO MUCH GRACE AND SUCH ENERGY OF THOUGHT WHETHER THY JUVENAL INSTRUCTS THE AGE IN CHASTER NUMBERS AND NEW POINTS HIS RAGE OR FAIR IRENE SEES ALAS TOO LATE
1885-136863-0015 HER INNOCENCE EXCHANG'D FOR GUILTY STATE WHATEVER YOU WRITE IN EVERY GOLDEN LINE

1885-136863-0017 YOU WAKE TO FINER FEELINGS EVERY HEART IN EACH BRIGHT PAGE SOME TRUTH IMPORTANT GIVE AND BID TO FUTURE TIMES THY RAMBLER LIVE
1885-136863-0018 DURING THE PUBLICATION OF THE GRAYS INN JOURNAL A PERIODICAL PAPER WHICH WAS SUCCESSFULLY CARRIED ON BY MISTER MURPHY ALONE WHEN A VERY YOUNG MAN HE HAPPENED TO BE IN THE COUNTRY WITH MISTER FOOTE
1885-136863-0019 AND HAVING MENTIONED THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO GO TO LONDON IN ORDER TO GET READY FOR THE PRESS IN ONE OF THE NUMBERS OF THAT JOURNAL FOOTE SAID TO HIM
1885-136863-0020 YOU NEED NOT TO GO ON THAT ACCOUNT HERE IS A FRENCH MAGAZINE IN WHICH YOU WILL FIND A VERY PRETTY ORIENTAL TALE TRANSLATE THAT AND SEND IT TO YOUR PRINTER
1885-136863-0021 MISTER MURPHY HAVING READ THE TALE WAS HIGHLY PLEASED WITH IT AND FOLLOWED FOOTE'S ADVICE WHEN HE RETURNED TO TOWN THIS TALE WAS POINTED OUT TO HIM IN THE RAMBLER FROM WHENCE IT HAD BEEN TRANSLATED INTO THE FRENCH MAGAZINE
1885-136863-0022 HAVE MORE MATERIALS FOR LETTERS THAN I WHO STAY AT HOME AND SHOULD THEREFORE WRITE WITH FREQUENCY EQUAL TO YOUR OPPORTUNITIES I SHOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE ALL ENGLAND SURVEYED BY YOU IF YOU WOULD IMPART YOUR OBSERVATIONS IN NARRATIVES AS AGREEABLE AS YOUR LAST
1885-136863-0023 KNOWLEDGE IS ALWAYS TO BE WISHED TO THOSE WHO CAN COMMUNICATE IT WELL WHILE YOU HAVE BEEN RIDING AND RUNNING AND SEEING THE TOMBS OF THE LEARNED AND THE CAMPS OF THE VALIANT I HAVE ONLY STAID AT HOME AND INTENDED TO DO GREAT THINGS WHICH I HAVE NOT DONE
1885-136863-0024 MISTER SHARPE IS OF OPINION THAT THE TEDIOUS MATURATION OF THE CATARACT IS A VULGAR ERROUR AND THAT IT MAY BE REMOVED AS SOON AS IT IS FORMED
1885-136863-0025 I DOUBT WHETHER IT BE UNIVERSALLY TRUE BUT IF IT BE TRUE IN SOME CASES AND THOSE CASES CAN BE DISTINGUISHED
1885-136863-0026 OF DEAR MISSUS LANGTON YOU GIVE ME NO ACCOUNT
1885-136863-0027 WHO HAVE LITTLE OF EITHER IN COMMON LIFE CAN EXHIBIT ON THE STAGE HIS VOICE WHEN STRAINED IS UNPLEASING AND WHEN LOW IS NOT ALWAYS HEARD
1885-136863-0028 BUT WHAT ADVANCES HE MADE IN IT CANNOT BE ASCERTAINED HE CERTAINLY WAS AT THIS TIME NOT ACTIVE FOR IN HIS SCRUPULOUS EXAMINATION OF HIMSELF ON EASTER EVE HE LAMENTS IN HIS TOO RIGOROUS MODE OF CENSURING HIS OWN CONDUCT
1885-136863-0029 THAT HIS LIFE SINCE THE COMMUNION OF THE PRECEDING EASTER HAD BEEN
1885-136863-0030 DISSIPATED AND USELESS
1885-136863-0031 HOWEVER CONTRIBUTED THIS YEAR THE PREFACE TO ROLT'S DICTIONARY OF TRADE AND COMMERCE IN WHICH HE DISPLAYS SUCH A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECT
1885-136863-0032 AS MIGHT LEAD THE READER TO THINK THAT ITS AUTHOUR HAD DEVOTED ALL HIS LIFE TO IT I ASKED HIM WHETHER HE KNEW MUCH OF ROLT AND OF HIS WORK
1885-136863-0033 SAID HE I NEVER SAW THE MAN AND NEVER READ THE BOOK THE BOOKSELLERS WANTED A PREFACE TO A DICTIONARY OF TRADE AND COMMERCE I KNEW VERY WELL WHAT SUCH A DICTIONARY SHOULD BE AND I WROTE A PREFACE ACCORDINGLY
1885-136863-0034 ROLT WHO WROTE A GREAT DEAL FOR THE BOOKSELLERS WAS AS JOHNSON TOLD ME
1885-136863-0035 I AM JUST COME FROM SAM JOHNSON
1885-136863-0036 THIS WAS A SUFFICIENT SPECIMEN OF HIS VANITY AND IMPUDENCE BUT HE GAVE A MORE EMINENT PROOF OF IT IN OUR SISTER KINGDOM AS DOCTOR JOHNSON INFORMED ME WHEN AKENSIDE'S PLEASURES OF THE IMAGINATION
1885-136863-0037 FIRST CAME OUT HE DID NOT PUT HIS NAME TO THE POEM ROLT WENT OVER TO DUBLIN PUBLISHED AN EDITION OF IT AND PUT HIS OWN NAME TO IT UPON THE FAME OF THIS HE LIVED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS
1885-136863-0038 THE INGENIOUS MISTER ROLT
1885-136863-0039 BUT IT WAS RECOLLECTED THAT BOTH ADDISON AND THOMSON WERE EQUALLY DULL TILL EXCITED BY WINE AKENSIDE HAVING BEEN INFORMED OF THIS IMPOSITION VINDICATED HIS RIGHT BY PUBLISHING THE POEM WITH ITS REAL AUTHOUR'S NAME
1885-136863-0040 SEVERAL INSTANCES OF SUCH LITERARY FRAUD HAVE BEEN DETECTED
1885-136863-0041 THE MANUSCRIPT OF WHICH HE SENT TO MISTER INNES A CLERGYMAN IN ENGLAND
1885-136863-0042 VERY MUCH SURPRISED TO SEE A POMPOUS EDITION OF IT IN FOLIO DEDICATED TO THE PRINCESS DOWAGER OF WALES BY A DOCTOR DOUGLAS AS HIS OWN SOME YEARS AGO A LITTLE NOVEL ENTITLED
1885-136863-0043 THE MAN OF FEELING WAS ASSUMED BY MISTER ECCLES A YOUNG IRISH CLERGYMAN
1885-136863-0044 WITH BLOTTINGS INTERLINEATIONS AND CORRECTIONS THAT IT MIGHT BE SHEWN TO SEVERAL PEOPLE AS AN ORIGINAL IT WAS IN TRUTH THE PRODUCTION OF MISTER HENRY MACKENZIE
1885-136863-0045 AN ATTORNEY IN THE EXCHEQUER AT EDINBURGH WHO IS THE AUTHOUR OF SEVERAL OTHER INGENIOUS PIECES BUT THE BELIEF WITH REGARD TO MISTER ECCLES BECAME SO GENERAL THAT IT WAS THOUGHT NECESSARY
1885-136863-0046 TO PUBLISH AN ADVERTISEMENT IN THE NEWSPAPERS CONTRADICTING THE REPORT
1885-136863-0047 THE FILIATION OF A LITERARY PERFORMANCE IS DIFFICULT OF PROOF SELDOM IS THERE ANY WITNESS PRESENT AT ITS BIRTH A MAN EITHER IN CONFIDENCE OR BY IMPROPER MEANS
1885-136863-0048 OBTAINS POSSESSION OF A COPY OF IT IN MANUSCRIPT AND BOLDLY PUBLISHES IT AS HIS OWN THE TRUE AUTHOUR IN MANY CASES
1885-136863-0049 THAT I DESIGN TO RECOMPENCE RARITY BY LENGTH A SHORT LETTER TO A DISTANT FRIEND IS IN MY OPINION AN INSULT LIKE THAT OF A SLIGHT BOW OR CURSORY SALUTATION A PROOF OF UNWILLINGNESS TO DO MUCH
1885-136863-0050 EVEN WHERE THERE IS A NECESSITY OF DOING SOMETHING YET IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT HE WHO CONTINUES THE SAME COURSE OF LIFE IN THE SAME PLACE WILL HAVE LITTLE TO TELL ONE WEEK AND ONE YEAR
1885-136863-0051 THE SILENT CHANGES MADE BY TIME ARE NOT ALWAYS PERCEIVED AND IF THEY ARE NOT PERCEIVED CANNOT BE RECOUNTED I HAVE RISEN AND LAIN DOWN TALKED AND MUSED
1885-136863-0052 THOUGH PERHAPS I HAVE ENVIED OTHERS HIS COMPANY AND I AM GLAD TO HAVE OTHER NATIONS MADE ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTER OF THE ENGLISH BY A TRAVELLER WHO HAS SO NICELY INSPECTED OUR MANNERS AND SO SUCCESSFULLY STUDIED OUR LITERATURE
1885-136863-0053 I RECEIVED YOUR KIND LETTER FROM FALMOUTH IN WHICH YOU GAVE ME NOTICE OF YOUR DEPARTURE FOR LISBON AND ANOTHER FROM LISBON IN WHICH YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE TO LEAVE PORTUGAL IN A FEW DAYS TO EITHER OF THESE
1885-136863-0054 HOW COULD ANY ANSWER BE RETURNED I HAVE HAD A THIRD FROM TURIN COMPLAINING THAT I HAVE NOT ANSWERED THE FORMER YOUR ENGLISH STYLE STILL CONTINUES IN ITS PURITY AND VIGOUR WITH VIGOUR YOUR GENIUS WILL SUPPLY IT
1885-136863-0055 TO USE TWO LANGUAGES FAMILIARLY AND WITHOUT CONTAMINATING ONE BY THE OTHER IS VERY DIFFICULT AND TO USE
1885-136863-0056 MAY BE SUFFICIENT TO EXCITE INDUSTRY BUT CAN HARDLY GENERATE CONFIDENCE I KNOW NOT WHETHER I CAN HEARTILY REJOICE AT THE KIND RECEPTION WHICH YOU HAVE FOUND OR AT THE POPULARITY TO WHICH YOU ARE EXALTED
1885-136863-0057 I AM WILLING THAT YOUR MERIT SHOULD BE DISTINGUISHED BUT CANNOT WISH THAT YOUR AFFECTIONS MAY BE GAINED I WOULD HAVE YOU HAPPY WHEREVER YOU ARE YET I WOULD HAVE YOU WISH TO RETURN TO ENGLAND IF EVER YOU VISIT US AGAIN
1885-136863-0058 YOU WILL FIND THE KINDNESS OF YOUR FRIENDS UNDIMINISHED TO TELL YOU HOW MANY ENQUIRIES ARE MADE AFTER YOU WOULD BE TEDIOUS OR IF NOT TEDIOUS WOULD BE VAIN BECAUSE YOU MAY BE TOLD IN A VERY FEW WORDS
1885-136863-0059 THAT ALL WHO KNEW YOU WISH YOU WELL
1885-136863-0060 WILL CARESS YOU AT YOUR RETURN THEREFORE DO NOT LET ITALIAN ACADEMICIANS NOR ITALIAN LADIES DRIVE US FROM YOUR THOUGHTS YOU MAY FIND AMONG US WHAT YOU WILL LEAVE BEHIND SOFT SMILES AND EASY SONNETS
1885-136863-0061 AS MAY COME WITHIN YOUR POWER HIS RELATIONS WILL THANK YOU FOR ANY SUCH GRATUITOUS ATTENTION AT LEAST THEY WILL NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANY EVIL THAT MAY HAPPEN WHETHER THEY THANK YOU OR NOT FOR ANY GOOD
1885-136863-0062 YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE A NEW KING AND A NEW PARLIAMENT
1885-136863-0063 WE WERE SO WEARY OF OUR OLD KING
1885-136863-0064 OF WHOM WE ARE SO MUCH INCLINED TO HOPE GREAT THINGS THAT MOST OF US BEGIN ALREADY TO BELIEVE THEM THE YOUNG MAN IS HITHERTO BLAMELESS BUT IT WOULD BE UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT MUCH FROM THE IMMATURITY OF JUVENILE YEARS
1885-136863-0065 AND THE IGNORANCE OF PRINCELY EDUCATION HE HAS BEEN LONG IN THE HANDS OF THE SCOTS AND HAS ALREADY FAVOURED THEM MORE THAN THE ENGLISH WILL CONTENTEDLY ENDURE
1885-136863-0066 BUT PERHAPS HE SCARCELY KNOWS WHOM HE HAS DISTINGUISHED OR WHOM HE HAS DISGUSTED
1885-136863-0067 THIS YEAR WAS THE SECOND EXHIBITION THEY PLEASE THEMSELVES MUCH WITH THE MULTITUDE OF SPECTATORS AND IMAGINE THAT THE ENGLISH SCHOOL WILL RISE IN REPUTATION REYNOLDS IS WITHOUT A RIVAL
1885-136863-0068 AND CONTINUES TO ADD THOUSANDS TO THOUSANDS WHICH HE DESERVES AMONG OTHER EXCELLENCIES BY RETAINING HIS KINDNESS FOR BARETTI
1885-136863-0069 I HAVE NOT SINCE THE DAY OF OUR SEPARATION SUFFERED OR DONE ANY THING CONSIDERABLE THE ONLY CHANGE IN MY WAY OF LIFE IS THAT I HAVE FREQUENTED THE THEATRE MORE THAN IN FORMER SEASONS
1885-136863-0070 BUT I HAVE GONE THITHER ONLY TO ESCAPE FROM MYSELF WE HAVE HAD MANY NEW FARCES AND THE COMEDY CALLED
1885-136863-0071 WAS YET SO WELL ADAPTED TO THE STAGE AND SO WELL EXHIBITED BY THE ACTORS THAT IT WAS CROWDED FOR NEAR TWENTY NIGHTS I AM DIGRESSING FROM MYSELF TO THE PLAY HOUSE
1885-136863-0072 BUT A BARREN PLAN MUST BE FILLED WITH EPISODES OF MYSELF I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY BUT THAT I HAVE HITHERTO LIVED WITHOUT THE CONCURRENCE OF MY OWN JUDGMENT YET I CONTINUE TO FLATTER MYSELF THAT WHEN YOU RETURN
1885-136863-0073 YOU WILL FIND ME MENDED I DO NOT WONDER THAT WHERE THE MONASTICK LIFE IS PERMITTED EVERY ORDER FINDS VOTARIES AND EVERY MONASTERY INHABITANTS MEN WILL SUBMIT TO ANY RULE
1885-136863-0074 BY WHICH THEY MAY BE EXEMPTED FROM THE TYRANNY OF CAPRICE AND OF CHANCE THEY ARE GLAD TO SUPPLY BY EXTERNAL AUTHORITY THEIR OWN WANT OF CONSTANCY AND RESOLUTION
1885-136863-0075 MY CURIOSITY WOULD BE MORE ATTRACTED BY CONVENTS THAN BY PALACES THOUGH I AM AFRAID THAT I SHOULD FIND EXPECTATION IN BOTH PLACES EQUALLY DISAPPOINTED AND LIFE IN BOTH PLACES SUPPORTED WITH IMPATIENCE AND QUITTED WITH RELUCTANCE
1885-136863-0076 IS A POWERFUL REMEDY AGAINST IMPATIENCE BUT WHAT SHALL FREE US FROM RELUCTANCE THOSE WHO HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO TEACH US TO DIE WELL HAVE TAUGHT FEW TO DIE WILLINGLY YET I CANNOT BUT HOPE THAT A GOOD LIFE MIGHT END AT LAST IN A CONTENTED DEATH
1885-136863-0077 YOU SEE TO WHAT A TRAIN OF THOUGHT I AM DRAWN BY THE MENTION OF MYSELF LET ME NOW TURN MY ATTENTION UPON YOU I HOPE YOU TAKE CARE TO KEEP AN EXACT JOURNAL
1885-136863-0078 YOU HAVE GIVEN US GOOD SPECIMENS IN YOUR LETTERS FROM LISBON
1885-136863-0079 BUT THE QUICKNESS OF YOUR DISCERNMENT
1885-136863-0080 AT LEAST YOU WILL KNOW BY MY LETTERS WHATEVER ELSE THEY MAY HAVE OR WANT THAT I CONTINUE TO BE YOUR MOST AFFECTIONATE FRIEND SAM JOHNSON
