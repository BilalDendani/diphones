923-132307-0000 FOR A MOMENT AFTER MISTER AND MISSUS DARLING LEFT THE HOUSE THE NIGHT LIGHTS BY THE BEDS OF THE THREE CHILDREN CONTINUED TO BURN CLEARLY
923-132307-0001 IT MADE THIS LIGHT BY FLASHING ABOUT SO QUICKLY
923-132307-0002 CUT LOW AND SQUARE THROUGH WHICH HER FIGURE COULD BE SEEN TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE
923-132307-0003 AND PETER DROPPED IN HE HAD CARRIED TINKER BELL PART OF THE WAY AND HIS HAND WAS STILL MESSY WITH THE FAIRY DUST TINKER BELL HE CALLED SOFTLY AFTER MAKING SURE THAT THE CHILDREN WERE ASLEEP TINK WHERE ARE YOU SHE WAS IN A JUG FOR THE MOMENT AND LIKING IT EXTREMELY SHE HAD NEVER BEEN IN A JUG BEFORE
923-132307-0004 THE LOVELIEST TINKLE AS OF GOLDEN BELLS ANSWERED HIM IT IS THE FAIRY LANGUAGE YOU ORDINARY CHILDREN CAN NEVER HEAR IT
923-132307-0005 TINK SAID THAT THE SHADOW WAS IN THE BIG BOX SHE MEANT THE CHEST OF DRAWERS AND PETER JUMPED AT THE DRAWERS SCATTERING THEIR CONTENTS TO THE FLOOR WITH BOTH HANDS AS KINGS TOSS HA'PENCE TO THE CROWD
923-132307-0006 A SHUDDER PASSED THROUGH PETER AND HE SAT ON THE FLOOR AND CRIED HIS SOBS WOKE WENDY AND SHE SAT UP IN BED
923-132307-0007 BOY SHE SAID COURTEOUSLY
923-132307-0008 SHE WAS MUCH PLEASED AND BOWED BEAUTIFULLY TO HIM FROM THE BED WHAT'S YOUR NAME HE ASKED
923-132307-0009 PETER PAN SHE WAS ALREADY SURE THAT HE MUST BE PETER BUT IT DID SEEM A COMPARATIVELY SHORT NAME IS THAT ALL YES HE SAID RATHER SHARPLY HE FELT FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT IT WAS A SHORTISH NAME I'M SO SORRY SAID WENDY MOIRA ANGELA IT DOESN'T MATTER PETER GULPED
923-132307-0010 SECOND TO THE RIGHT SAID PETER AND THEN STRAIGHT ON TILL MORNING WHAT A FUNNY ADDRESS PETER HAD A SINKING FOR THE FIRST TIME HE FELT THAT PERHAPS IT WAS A FUNNY ADDRESS NO IT ISN'T HE SAID I MEAN WENDY SAID NICELY REMEMBERING THAT SHE WAS HOSTESS IS THAT WHAT THEY PUT ON THE LETTERS
923-132307-0011 HE WISHED SHE HAD NOT MENTIONED LETTERS DON'T GET ANY LETTERS HE SAID CONTEMPTUOUSLY BUT YOUR MOTHER GETS LETTERS DON'T HAVE A MOTHER HE SAID NOT ONLY HAD HE NO MOTHER BUT HE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST DESIRE TO HAVE ONE HE THOUGHT THEM VERY OVER RATED PERSONS
923-132307-0012 O PETER NO WONDER YOU WERE CRYING SHE SAID AND GOT OUT OF BED AND RAN TO HIM
923-132307-0013 IT HAS COME OFF YES THEN WENDY SAW THE SHADOW ON THE FLOOR
923-132307-0014 HOW EXACTLY LIKE A BOY FORTUNATELY SHE KNEW AT ONCE WHAT TO DO IT MUST BE SEWN ON SHE SAID JUST A LITTLE PATRONISINGLY WHAT'S SEWN HE ASKED
923-132307-0015 BUT SHE WAS EXULTING IN HIS IGNORANCE
923-132307-0016 AND HE WAS NOW JUMPING ABOUT IN THE WILDEST GLEE
923-132307-0017 HE THOUGHT HE HAD ATTACHED THE SHADOW HIMSELF HOW CLEVER I AM HE CROWED RAPTUROUSLY OH THE CLEVERNESS OF ME IT IS HUMILIATING TO HAVE TO CONFESS THAT THIS CONCEIT OF PETER WAS ONE OF HIS MOST FASCINATING QUALITIES
923-132307-0018 BUT FOR THE MOMENT WENDY WAS SHOCKED
923-132307-0019 OF COURSE I DID NOTHING YOU DID A LITTLE PETER SAID CARELESSLY AND CONTINUED TO DANCE
923-132307-0020 AND SHE SPRANG IN THE MOST DIGNIFIED WAY INTO BED AND COVERED HER FACE WITH THE BLANKETS
923-132307-0021 STILL SHE WOULD NOT LOOK UP THOUGH SHE WAS LISTENING EAGERLY WENDY HE CONTINUED IN A VOICE THAT NO WOMAN HAS EVER YET BEEN ABLE TO RESIST WENDY ONE GIRL IS MORE USE THAN TWENTY BOYS
923-132307-0022 DO YOU REALLY THINK SO PETER YES I DO
923-132307-0023 AND I'LL GET UP AGAIN AND SHE SAT WITH HIM ON THE SIDE OF THE BED
923-132307-0024 SURELY YOU KNOW WHAT A KISS IS SHE ASKED AGHAST
923-132307-0025 NOW SAID HE SHALL I GIVE YOU A KISS AND SHE REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT PRIMNESS IF YOU PLEASE SHE MADE HERSELF RATHER CHEAP BY INCLINING HER FACE TOWARD HIM
923-132307-0026 FOR IT WAS AFTERWARDS TO SAVE HER LIFE WHEN PEOPLE IN OUR SET ARE INTRODUCED IT IS CUSTOMARY FOR THEM TO ASK EACH OTHER'S AGE AND SO WENDY WHO ALWAYS LIKED TO DO THE CORRECT THING ASKED PETER HOW OLD HE WAS
923-132307-0027 IT WAS LIKE AN EXAMINATION PAPER THAT ASKS GRAMMAR WHEN WHAT YOU WANT TO BE ASKED IS KINGS OF ENGLAND I DON'T KNOW HE REPLIED UNEASILY BUT I AM QUITE YOUNG
923-132307-0028 WENDY I RAN AWAY THE DAY I WAS BORN WENDY WAS QUITE SURPRISED BUT INTERESTED AND SHE INDICATED IN THE CHARMING DRAWING ROOM MANNER
923-132307-0029 TEDIOUS TALK THIS BUT BEING A STAY AT HOME SHE LIKED IT AND SO HE WENT ON GOOD NATUREDLY THERE OUGHT TO BE ONE FAIRY FOR EVERY BOY AND GIRL OUGHT TO BE ISN'T THERE NO
923-132307-0030 WENDY'S HEART WENT FLUTTER WITH A SUDDEN THRILL PETER SHE CRIED CLUTCHING HIM
923-132307-0031 SHE WAS HERE JUST NOW HE SAID A LITTLE IMPATIENTLY YOU DON'T HEAR HER DO YOU AND THEY BOTH LISTENED THE ONLY SOUND I HEAR SAID WENDY IS LIKE A TINKLE OF BELLS
923-132307-0032 THE SOUND CAME FROM THE CHEST OF DRAWERS AND PETER MADE A MERRY FACE
923-132307-0033 WENDY HE WHISPERED GLEEFULLY I DO BELIEVE I SHUT HER UP IN THE DRAWER
923-132307-0034 THEY HARDLY EVER STAND STILL HE SAID BUT FOR ONE MOMENT WENDY SAW THE ROMANTIC FIGURE COME TO REST ON THE CUCKOO CLOCK O THE LOVELY SHE CRIED THOUGH TINK'S FACE WAS STILL DISTORTED WITH PASSION TINK SAID PETER AMIABLY

923-132307-0037 HOWEVER JOHN CONTINUED TO SLEEP SO PLACIDLY ON THE FLOOR THAT SHE ALLOWED HIM TO REMAIN THERE AND I KNOW YOU MEANT TO BE KIND SHE SAID RELENTING
923-132307-0038 FOR THE MOMENT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HIS IGNORANCE ABOUT KISSES I THOUGHT YOU WOULD WANT IT BACK HE SAID A LITTLE BITTERLY
