6131-57188-0000 THE CAUSE OF WHICH WAS AS FOLLOWS WHEN HE RAN AWAY FROM MISTLETOE AS HE CERTAINLY DID HE HAD THOUGHT MUCH ABOUT THAT JOURNEY HOME IN THE CARRIAGE AND WAS QUITE AWARE THAT HE HAD MADE AN ASS OF HIMSELF
6131-57188-0001 HIS NEIGHBOUR HAD SAID SOME WORD TO HIM IN JOKE AS TO HIS ATTACHMENT TO MISS TREFOIL AND AFTER THE LADIES HAD LEFT THE ROOM ANOTHER NEIGHBOUR OF THE OTHER SEX HAD HOPED THAT HE HAD HAD A PLEASANT TIME ON THE ROAD
6131-57188-0002 AGAIN IN THE DRAWING ROOM IT HAD SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS OBSERVED HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM SAYING A FEW WORDS TO ARABELLA AS SHE LAY ON THE SOFA NOT TO DO SO AFTER WHAT HAD OCCURRED WOULD HAVE BEEN IN ITSELF PECULIAR BUT WHEN HE DID SO
6131-57188-0003 SOME OTHER MAN WHO WAS NEAR HER MADE WAY FOR HIM AS THOUGH SHE WERE ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE ALTOGETHER HIS PROPERTY AND THEN THE DUCHESS HAD STRIVEN TO CATCH HIM AND LEAD HIM INTO SPECIAL CONVERSATION WHEN THIS ATTEMPT WAS MADE
6131-57188-0004 HE DECIDED THAT HE MUST AT ONCE RETREAT OR ELSE MAKE UP HIS MIND TO MARRY THE YOUNG LADY AND THEREFORE HE RETREATED HE BREAKFASTED THAT MORNING AT THE INN AT STAMFORD AND AS HE SMOKED HIS CIGAR AFTERWARDS
6131-57188-0005 HE POSITIVELY RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES MARRY ARABELLA TREFOIL HE WAS BEING HUNTED AND RUN DOWN AND WITH THE INSTINCT OF ALL ANIMALS THAT ARE HUNTED HE PREPARED HIMSELF FOR ESCAPE
6131-57188-0006 IT MIGHT BE SAID NO DOUBT WOULD BE SAID THAT HE BEHAVED BADLY THAT WOULD BE SAID BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT BE OPEN TO HIM TO TELL THE TRUTH THE LADY IN SUCH A CASE CAN ALWAYS TELL HER STORY
6131-57188-0007 WITH WHAT EXAGGERATION SHE MAY PLEASE TO GIVE AND CAN COMPLAIN THE MAN NEVER CAN DO SO
6131-57188-0008 SHE WOULD FALL INTO MY ARMS SHE WOULD EMBRACE ME SHE PERSISTED IN ASKING ME WHETHER I LOVED HER THOUGH A MAN HAVE TO BE SHOT FOR IT OR KICKED FOR IT OR EVEN THOUGH HE HAVE TO ENDURE PERPETUAL SCORN FOR IT
6131-57188-0009 HE CANNOT SAY THAT LET IT BE EVER SO TRUE AND YET IS A MAN TO BE FORCED INTO A MARRIAGE WHICH HE DESPISES HE WOULD NOT BE FORCED INTO THE MARRIAGE AND THE SOONER HE RETREATED
6131-57188-0010 THE LESS WOULD BE THE METAPHORICAL SHOOTING AND KICKING AND THE REAL SCORN HE MUST GET OUT OF IT AS BEST HE COULD BUT THAT HE WOULD GET OUT OF IT HE WAS QUITE DETERMINED
6131-57188-0011 THAT AFTERNOON HE REACHED MISTER SURBITON'S HOUSE AS DID ALSO CAPTAIN BATTERSBY AND HIS HORSES GROOMS AND OTHER BELONGINGS WHEN THERE HE RECEIVED A LOT OF LETTERS AND
6131-57188-0012 INQUIRING AS TO A CERTAIN HIRING OF ROOMS AND PREPARATION FOR A DINNER OR DINNERS WHICH HAD BEEN SPOKEN OF IN REFERENCE TO A FINAL SHOOTING DECREED TO TAKE PLACE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF DILLSBOROUGH IN THE LAST WEEK OF JANUARY
6131-57188-0013 SUCH THINGS WERE OFTEN PLANNED BY LORD RUFFORD AND AFTERWARDS FORGOTTEN OR NEGLECTED
6131-57188-0014 HE HAD NOT INTENDED TO GO TO MISTLETOE NOR TO STAY SO LONG WITH HIS FRIEND SURBITON BUT NOW HE ALMOST THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO BE BACK AT RUFFORD HALL WHERE AT PRESENT HIS SISTER WAS STAYING WITH HER HUSBAND SIR GEORGE PENWETHER
6131-57188-0015 HIS OLD FRIEND TOM SURBITON SAID A FEW WORDS TO HIM WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF SENDING HIM BACK TO RUFFORD THEY HAD SAT OUT THE REST OF THE MEN WHO FORMED THE PARTY AND WERE ALONE IN THE SMOKING ROOM SO YOU'RE GOING TO MARRY MISS TREFOIL SAID TOM SURBITON
6131-57188-0016 WHO PERHAPS OF ALL HIS FRIENDS WAS THE MOST INTIMATE WHO SAYS SO I AM SAYING SO AT PRESENT YOU ARE NOT SAYING IT ON YOUR OWN AUTHORITY YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ME AND MISS TREFOIL IN A ROOM TOGETHER
6131-57188-0017 OF COURSE SUCH A THING CANNOT BE ARRANGED WITHOUT BEING TALKED ABOUT IT HAS NOT BEEN ARRANGED IF YOU DON'T MEAN TO HAVE IT ARRANGED YOU HAD BETTER LOOK TO IT I AM SPEAKING IN EARNEST RUFFORD I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE UP AUTHORITIES INDEED IF I DID
6131-57188-0018 VERY SERVANTS SUPPOSE THAT THEY KNOW IT AND THERE ISN'T A GROOM OR HORSEBOY ABOUT WHO ISN'T IN HIS HEART
6131-57188-0019 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS TOM WELL WHAT IS IT IF THIS HAD COME FROM ANY OTHER MAN THAN YOURSELF I SHOULD QUARREL WITH HIM I AM NOT ENGAGED TO THE YOUNG LADY NOR HAVE I DONE ANYTHING TO WARRANT ANYBODY IN SAYING SO
6131-57188-0020 THEN I MAY CONTRADICT IT I DON'T WANT YOU EITHER TO CONTRADICT IT OR AFFIRM IT IT WOULD BE AN IMPERTINENCE TO THE YOUNG LADY IF I WERE TO INSTRUCT ANY ONE TO CONTRADICT SUCH A REPORT BUT AS A FACT I AM NOT ENGAGED TO MARRY MISS TREFOIL
6131-57188-0021 NOR IS THERE THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE THAT I EVER SHALL BE SO ENGAGED SO SAYING HE TOOK UP HIS CANDLESTICK AND WALKED OFF EARLY ON THE NEXT MORNING HE SAW HIS FRIEND AND MADE SOME SORT OF LAUGHING APOLOGY FOR HIS HEAT ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING
6131-57188-0022 IT IS SO D HARD WHEN THESE KIND OF THINGS ARE SAID BECAUSE A MAN HAS LENT A YOUNG LADY A HORSE HOWEVER TOM BETWEEN YOU AND ME THE THING IS A LIE I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR IT SAID TOM
6131-57188-0023 AND NOW I WANT YOU TO COME OVER TO RUFFORD ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH THEN HE EXPLAINED THE DETAILS OF HIS PROPOSED PARTY AND GOT HIS FRIEND TO PROMISE THAT HE WOULD COME HE ALSO MADE IT UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS GOING HOME AT ONCE
6131-57188-0024 THERE WERE A HUNDRED THINGS HE SAID WHICH MADE IT NECESSARY
6131-57188-0025 AND LORD RUFFORD LEFT HIS FRIEND ON THAT DAY AND WENT UP TO LONDON ON HIS ROAD TO RUFFORD HE WAS CERTAINLY DISTURBED IN HIS MIND FORESEEING THAT THERE MIGHT BE MUCH DIFFICULTY IN HIS WAY
6131-57188-0026 HE REMEMBERED WITH FAIR ACCURACY ALL THAT HAD OCCURRED DURING THE JOURNEY FROM STAMFORD TO MISTLETOE HE FELT ASSURED THAT UP TO THAT TIME HE HAD SAID NOTHING WHICH COULD BE TAKEN TO MEAN A REAL DECLARATION OF LOVE ALL THAT AT RUFFORD HAD BEEN NOTHING
6131-57188-0027 IN THE CARRIAGE SHE HAD ASKED HIM WHETHER HE LOVED HER AND HE HAD SAID THAT HE DID HE HAD ALSO DECLARED THAT HE WOULD DO ANYTHING IN HIS POWER TO MAKE HER HAPPY WAS A MAN TO BE BOUND TO MARRY A GIRL BECAUSE OF SUCH A SCENE AS THAT THERE WAS HOWEVER
6131-57188-0028 NOTHING FOR HIM TO DO EXCEPT TO KEEP OUT OF THE GIRL'S WAY IF SHE TOOK ANY STEPS THEN HE MUST ACT BUT AS HE THOUGHT OF IT HE SWORE TO HIMSELF THAT NOTHING SHOULD INDUCE HIM TO MARRY HER
6131-57188-0029 HE REMAINED A COUPLE OF DAYS IN TOWN AND REACHED RUFFORD HALL ON THE MONDAY JUST A WEEK FROM THE DAY OF THAT FATAL MEET AT PELTRY THERE HE FOUND SIR GEORGE AND HIS SISTER AND MISS PENGE AND SPENT HIS FIRST EVENING IN QUIET
6131-57188-0030 HE INVITED HAMPTON TO SHOOT WITH HIM SURBITON AND BATTERSBY WERE COMING AND HIS BROTHER IN LAW NOT WISHING TO HAVE LESS THAN SIX GUNS HE ASKED HAMPTON HOW HE COULD MAKE UP HIS PARTY MORTON DOESN'T SHOOT HE SAID AND IS AS STIFF AS A POST
6131-57188-0031 I'M SICK OF BOTH THE BOTSEYS CONTINUED THE LORD THINKING MORE OF HIS PARTY THAN OF MISTER MORTON'S HEALTH PUREFOY IS STILL SULKY WITH ME BECAUSE HE KILLED POOR OLD CANEBACK THEN HAMPTON SUGGESTED THAT IF HE WOULD ASK
6131-57188-0032 IT MIGHT BE THE MEANS OF SAVING THAT UNFORTUNATE YOUNG MAN'S LIFE THE STORY OF HIS UNREQUITED LOVE WAS KNOWN TO EVERY ONE AT DILLSBOROUGH AND IT WAS NOW TOLD TO LORD RUFFORD HE IS NOT HALF A BAD FELLOW SAID HAMPTON
6131-57188-0033 AND QUITE AS MUCH LIKE A GENTLEMAN AS EITHER OF THE BOTSEYS I SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO SAVE THE LIFE OF SO GOOD A MAN ON SUCH EASY TERMS SAID THE LORD THEN AND THERE WITH A PENCIL ON THE BACK OF AN OLD LETTER
6131-57188-0034 HE WROTE A LINE TO LARRY ASKING HIM TO SHOOT ON NEXT SATURDAY AND TO DINE WITH HIM AFTERWARDS AT THE BUSH THAT EVENING ON HIS RETURN HOME HE FOUND BOTH THE LETTERS FROM ARABELLA AS IT HAPPENED HE READ THEM IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN WRITTEN
6131-57188-0035 FIRST THE LAUGHING LETTER AND THEN THE ONE THAT WAS DECLARED TO BE SERIOUS THE EARLIER OF THE TWO DID NOT ANNOY HIM MUCH IT CONTAINED HARDLY MORE THAN THOSE FORMER LETTERS WHICH HAD INDUCED HIM TO GO TO MISTLETOE
6131-57188-0036 BUT THE SECOND LETTER OPENED UP HER ENTIRE STRATEGY SHE HAD TOLD THE DUCHESS THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED TO HIM AND THE DUCHESS OF COURSE WOULD HAVE TOLD THE DUKE AND NOW SHE WROTE TO HIM ASKING HIM TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ENGAGEMENT IN BLACK AND WHITE
6131-57188-0037 THE FIRST LETTER HE MIGHT HAVE IGNORED HE MIGHT HAVE LEFT IT UNANSWERED WITHOUT GROSS MISCONDUCT BUT THE SECOND LETTER WHICH SHE HERSELF HAD DECLARED TO BE A SERIOUS EPISTLE WAS ONE WHICH HE COULD NOT NEGLECT
6131-57188-0038 NOW HAD COME HIS DIFFICULTY WHAT MUST HE DO HOW SHOULD HE ANSWER IT WAS IT IMPERATIVE ON HIM TO WRITE THE WORDS WITH HIS OWN HAND WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD GET HIS SISTER TO UNDERTAKE THE COMMISSION
6131-57188-0039 HE SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT TO ANY ONE FOR FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS BUT HE PASSED THOSE HOURS IN MUCH DISCOMFORT IT DID SEEM SO HARD TO HIM THAT BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO CARRY A LADY HOME FROM HUNTING IN A POSTCHAISE
6131-57188-0040 THAT HE SHOULD BE DRIVEN TO SUCH STRAITS AS THIS THE GIRL WAS EVIDENTLY PREPARED TO MAKE A FIGHT OF IT THERE WOULD BE THE DUKE AND THE DUCHESS AND THAT PRIG MISTLETOE AND THAT IDLE ASS LORD AUGUSTUS
6131-57188-0041 AND THAT VENOMOUS OLD WOMAN HER MOTHER ALL AT HIM HE ALMOST DOUBTED WHETHER A SHOOTING EXCURSION IN CENTRAL AFRICA OR A VISIT TO THE PAMPAS WOULD NOT BE THE BEST THING FOR HIM BUT STILL
6131-57188-0042 THOUGH HE SHOULD RESOLVE TO PASS FIVE YEARS AMONG THE ANDES HE MUST ANSWER THE LADY'S LETTER BEFORE HE WENT THEN HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD TELL EVERYTHING TO HIS BROTHER IN LAW AS FAR AS EVERYTHING CAN BE TOLD IN SUCH A MATTER
6131-57188-0043 SIR GEORGE WAS NEAR FIFTY FULL FIFTEEN YEARS OLDER THAN HIS WIFE WHO WAS AGAIN OLDER THAN HER BROTHER HE WAS A MAN OF MODERATE WEALTH VERY MUCH RESPECTED AND SUPPOSED TO BE POSSESSED OF ALMOST INFINITE WISDOM
6131-57188-0044 HE WAS ONE OF THOSE FEW HUMAN BEINGS WHO SEEM NEVER TO MAKE A MISTAKE WHATEVER HE PUT HIS HAND TO CAME OUT WELL AND YET EVERYBODY LIKED HIM HIS BROTHER IN LAW WAS A LITTLE AFRAID OF HIM BUT YET WAS ALWAYS GLAD TO SEE HIM
6131-57188-0045 HE KEPT AN EXCELLENT HOUSE IN LONDON BUT HAVING NO COUNTRY HOUSE OF HIS OWN PASSED MUCH OF HIS TIME AT RUFFORD HALL WHEN THE OWNER WAS NOT THERE
6131-57188-0046 SIR GEORGE WAS MUCH ATTACHED TO HIM AND ALWAYS READY TO HELP HIM IN HIS DIFFICULTIES PENWETHER SAID THE LORD I HAVE GOT MYSELF INTO AN AWFUL SCRAPE I AM SORRY TO HEAR IT A WOMAN I SUPPOSE OH YES
6131-57188-0047 I NEVER GAMBLE AND THEREFORE NO OTHER SCRAPE CAN BE AWFUL A YOUNG LADY WANTS TO MARRY ME THAT IS NOT UNNATURAL BUT I AM QUITE DETERMINED LET THE RESULT BE WHAT IT MAY THAT I WON'T MARRY THE YOUNG LADY
6131-57188-0048 IS THE YOUNG LADY MISS TREFOIL I DID NOT MEAN TO MENTION ANY NAME TILL I WAS SURE IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY BUT IT IS MISS TREFOIL ELEANOR HAD TOLD ME SOMETHING OF IT
6131-57188-0049 THE YOUNG LADY WAS HERE WITH HER MOTHER AND FOR THE MATTER OF THAT WITH A GENTLEMAN TO WHOM SHE WAS CERTAINLY ENGAGED BUT NOTHING PARTICULAR OCCURRED HERE THAT UNFORTUNATE BALL WAS GOING ON WHEN POOR CANEBACK WAS DYING
6131-57188-0050 BUT I MET HER SINCE THAT AT MISTLETOE I CAN HARDLY ADVISE YOU KNOW UNLESS YOU TELL ME EVERYTHING THEN LORD RUFFORD BEGAN THESE KIND OF THINGS ARE SOMETIMES DEUCED HARD UPON A MAN
6131-57188-0051 OF COURSE IF A MAN WERE A SAINT OR A PHILOSOPHER OR A JOSEPH HE WOULDN'T GET INTO SUCH SCRAPES AND PERHAPS EVERY MAN OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING OF THAT SORT
6131-57188-0052 BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW A MAN IS TO DO IT UNLESS IT'S BORN WITH HIM A LITTLE PRUDENCE I SHOULD SAY YOU MIGHT AS WELL TELL A FELLOW THAT IT IS HIS DUTY TO BE SIX FEET HIGH BUT WHAT HAVE YOU SAID TO THE YOUNG LADY
6131-57188-0053 OR WHAT HAS SHE SAID TO YOU THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DEAL MORE OF THE LATTER THAN THE FORMER I SAY SO TO YOU BUT OF COURSE IT IS NOT TO BE SAID THAT I HAVE SAID SO I CANNOT GO FORTH TO THE WORLD COMPLAINING OF A YOUNG LADY'S CONDUCT TO ME
6131-57188-0054 IT IS A MATTER IN WHICH A MAN MUST NOT TELL THE TRUTH BUT WHAT IS THE TRUTH SHE WRITES ME WORD TO SAY THAT SHE HAS TOLD ALL HER FRIENDS THAT I AM ENGAGED TO HER
6131-57188-0055 AND KINDLY PRESSES ME TO MAKE GOOD HER ASSURANCES BY BECOMING SO AND WHAT HAS PASSED BETWEEN YOU A FAINTING FIT IN A CARRIAGE AND HALF A DOZEN KISSES NOTHING MORE NOTHING MORE THAT IS MATERIAL
6131-57188-0056 OF COURSE ONE CANNOT TELL IT ALL DOWN TO EACH MAWKISH WORD OF HUMBUGGING SENTIMENT THERE ARE HER LETTERS AND WHAT I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER IS THAT I NEVER ASKED HER TO BE MY WIFE AND THAT NO CONSIDERATION ON EARTH SHALL INDUCE ME TO BECOME HER HUSBAND
6131-57188-0057 THOUGH ALL THE DUCHESSES IN ENGLAND WERE TO PERSECUTE ME TO THE DEATH I MEAN TO STICK TO THAT THEN SIR GEORGE READ THE LETTERS AND HANDED THEM BACK SHE SEEMS TO ME SAID HE TO HAVE MORE WIT ABOUT HER
6131-57188-0058 THAN ANY OF THE FAMILY THAT I HAVE HAD THE HONOUR OF MEETING SHE HAS WIT ENOUGH AND PLUCK TOO YOU HAVE NEVER SAID A WORD TO HER TO ENCOURAGE THESE HOPES MY DEAR PENWETHER
6131-57188-0059 DON'T YOU KNOW THAT IF A MAN WITH A LARGE INCOME SAYS TO A GIRL LIKE THAT THAT THE SUN SHINES HE ENCOURAGES HOPE I UNDERSTAND THAT WELL ENOUGH I AM A RICH MAN WITH A TITLE AND A BIG HOUSE AND A GREAT COMMAND OF LUXURIES
6131-57188-0060 THERE ARE SO MANY YOUNG LADIES WHO WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE RICH AND TO HAVE A TITLE AND A BIG HOUSE AND A COMMAND OF LUXURIES ONE SOMETIMES FEELS ONESELF LIKE A CARCASE IN THE MIDST OF VULTURES MARRY AFTER A PROPER FASHION
6131-57188-0061 AND YOU'LL GET RID OF ALL THAT I'LL THINK ABOUT IT BUT IN THE MEANTIME WHAT CAN I SAY TO THIS YOUNG WOMAN WHEN I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I KISSED HER OF COURSE I ENCOURAGED HOPES NO DOUBT
6131-57188-0062 BUT SAINT ANTHONY WOULD HAVE HAD TO KISS THIS YOUNG WOMAN IF SHE HAD MADE HER ATTACK UPON HIM AS SHE DID ON ME AND AFTER ALL A KISS DOESN'T GO FOR EVERYTHING THESE ARE THINGS PENWETHER THAT MUST NOT BE INQUIRED INTO TOO CURIOUSLY
6131-57188-0063 BUT I WON'T MARRY HER THOUGH IT WERE A SCORE OF KISSES AND NOW WHAT MUST I DO SIR GEORGE SAID THAT HE WOULD TAKE TILL THE NEXT MORNING TO THINK ABOUT IT
