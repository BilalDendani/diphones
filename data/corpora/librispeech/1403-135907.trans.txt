1403-135907-0016 HE ORDERED THE OFFICERS OF THE POLICE AND JUSTICE TO MAKE STRICT SEARCH FOR THE CRIMINAL THEY SENT THEIR SERVANTS ABOUT AND THEY WERE NOT IDLE THEMSELVES FOR THEY WERE NO LESS CONCERNED IN THIS MATTER THAN THE VIZIER BUT ALL THEIR ENDEAVOURS WERE TO NO PURPOSE
1403-135907-0017 WHAT PAINS SOEVER THEY TOOK THEY COULD NOT DISCOVER THE MURDERER SO THAT THE VIZIER CONCLUDED HIS LIFE TO BE LOST THE THIRD DAY BEING ARRIVED AN OFFICER CAME TO THE UNFORTUNATE MINISTER WITH A SUMMONS TO FOLLOW HIM WHICH THE VIZIER OBEYED

1403-135907-0021 WHEN ALL THINGS WERE READY THE CRIMINAL JUDGE AND MANY OFFICERS BELONGING TO THE PALACE HAVING BROUGHT OUT THE GRAND VIZIER WITH THE FORTY BERMUKKEES SET EACH BY THE STAKE DESIGNED FOR HIM
1403-135907-0022 THE MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE THAT FILLED THE SQUARE COULD NOT WITHOUT GRIEF AND TEARS BEHOLD THIS TRAGICAL SIGHT
1403-135907-0023 NOT ONLY IN BAGDAD BUT THROUGH ALL THE DOMINIONS OF THE CALIPH NOTHING COULD PREVENT THE EXECUTION OF THIS PRINCE'S SEVERE AND IRREVOCABLE SENTENCE AND THE LIVES OF THE MOST DESERVING PEOPLE IN THE CITY
1403-135907-0024 WERE JUST GOING TO BE SACRIFICED WHEN A YOUNG MAN OF HANDSOME MIEN PRESSED THROUGH THE CROWD TILL HE CAME UP TO THE GRAND VIZIER
1403-135907-0025 AND COMFORTER OF THE POOR YOU ARE NOT GUILTY OF THE CRIME FOR WHICH YOU STAND HERE WITHDRAW AND LET ME EXPIATE THE DEATH OF THE LADY THAT WAS THROWN INTO THE TIGRIS IT IS I WHO MURDERED HER AND I DESERVE TO BE PUNISHED FOR MY OFFENCE

1403-135907-0031 THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN THE OLD AND THE YOUNG MAN INDUCED THE GRAND VIZIER TO CARRY THEM BOTH BEFORE THE CALIPH TO WHICH THE JUDGE CRIMINAL CONSENTED BEING GLAD TO SERVE THE VIZIER
