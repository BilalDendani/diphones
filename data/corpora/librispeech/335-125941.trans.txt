335-125941-0001 THE INVADING ARMY ENTERED THE CITY MORE SLOWLY FOR THEY STOPPED TO DIG EMERALDS OUT OF THE WALLS AND PAVING STONES WITH THE POINTS OF THEIR KNITTING NEEDLES SO THE SOLDIER AND THE BOY REACHED THE PALACE BEFORE THE NEWS HAD SPREAD THAT THE CITY WAS CONQUERED
335-125941-0002 THE SCARECROW AND JACK PUMPKINHEAD WERE STILL PLAYING AT QUOITS IN THE COURTYARD WHEN THE GAME WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE ABRUPT ENTRANCE OF THE ROYAL ARMY OF OZ WHO CAME FLYING IN WITHOUT HIS HAT OR GUN

335-125941-0009 FOR NO MAN COULD FACE THE TERRIBLE WEAPONS OF THE INVADERS WELL SAID THE SCARECROW AFTER A MOMENT'S THOUGHT
335-125941-0010 AND THIS CROWN IS SO HEAVY THAT IT MAKES MY HEAD ACHE BUT I HOPE THE CONQUERORS HAVE NO INTENTION OF INJURING ME JUST BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO BE THE KING I HEARD THEM SAY REMARKED TIP WITH SOME HESITATION THAT THEY
335-125941-0011 THEN I AM REALLY IN DANGER DECLARED HIS MAJESTY POSITIVELY AND IT WILL BE WISE FOR ME TO CONSIDER A MEANS TO ESCAPE
335-125941-0012 IT IS TOO LATE TO ESCAPE THEY WOULD SOON TEAR YOU TO PIECES THE SCARECROW SIGHED IN AN EMERGENCY HE ANNOUNCED IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING TO PAUSE AND REFLECT

335-125941-0016 IF YOU'LL KEEP QUIET LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO THINK I'LL TRY TO FIND SOME WAY FOR US ALL TO ESCAPE
335-125941-0017 AT THE END OF THAT TIME HE FACED THEM WITH A MORE CHEERFUL EXPRESSION UPON HIS PAINTED FACE WHERE IS THE SAW HORSE YOU RODE HERE HE ASKED THE PUMPKINHEAD
335-125941-0018 IT WAS THE ONLY PLACE I COULD THINK OF YOUR MAJESTY ADDED THE SOLDIER FEARING HE HAD MADE A BLUNDER IT PLEASES ME VERY MUCH SAID THE SCARECROW HAS THE ANIMAL BEEN FED
335-125941-0019 EXCELLENT CRIED THE SCARECROW BRING THE HORSE HERE AT ONCE THE SOLDIER HASTENED AWAY AND PRESENTLY THEY HEARD THE CLATTERING OF THE HORSE'S WOODEN LEGS UPON THE PAVEMENT AS HE WAS LED INTO THE COURTYARD HIS MAJESTY REGARDED THE STEED CRITICALLY
335-125941-0020 HE DOESN'T SEEM ESPECIALLY GRACEFUL HE REMARKED MUSINGLY BUT I SUPPOSE HE CAN RUN HE CAN INDEED SAID TIP GAZING UPON THE SAW HORSE ADMIRINGLY
335-125941-0021 OBJECTED TIP NO BUT HE MAY BE INDUCED TO CARRY THREE SAID HIS MAJESTY I SHALL THEREFORE LEAVE MY ROYAL ARMY BEHIND FOR FROM THE EASE WITH WHICH HE WAS CONQUERED
335-125941-0022 I HAVE LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN HIS POWERS STILL HE CAN RUN
335-125941-0023 I EXPECTED THIS BLOW SAID THE SOLDIER SULKILY BUT I CAN BEAR IT I SHALL DISGUISE MYSELF BY CUTTING OFF MY LOVELY GREEN WHISKERS AND AFTER ALL
335-125941-0024 IT IS NO MORE DANGEROUS TO FACE THOSE RECKLESS GIRLS THAN TO RIDE THIS FIERY UNTAMED WOODEN HORSE PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT OBSERVED HIS MAJESTY BUT FOR MY PART NOT BEING A SOLDIER I AM FOND OF DANGER
335-125941-0025 NOW MY BOY YOU MUST MOUNT FIRST AND PLEASE SIT AS CLOSE TO THE HORSE'S NECK AS POSSIBLE TIP CLIMBED QUICKLY TO HIS PLACE AND THE SOLDIER AND THE SCARECROW MANAGED TO HOIST THE PUMPKINHEAD TO A SEAT JUST BEHIND HIM
335-125941-0026 THERE REMAINED SO LITTLE SPACE FOR THE KING THAT HE WAS LIABLE TO FALL OFF AS SOON AS THE HORSE STARTED FETCH A CLOTHESLINE SAID THE KING TO HIS ARMY AND TIE US ALL TOGETHER
335-125941-0027 THEN IF ONE FALLS OFF WE WILL ALL FALL OFF AND WHILE THE SOLDIER WAS GONE FOR THE CLOTHESLINE HIS MAJESTY CONTINUED
335-125941-0028 NOT EXACTLY REPLIED THE SCARECROW FOR IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO ME
335-125941-0029 THEY COULD USE YOU FOR SEED THE SOLDIER NOW RETURNED WITH A LONG LINE AND TIED ALL THREE FIRMLY TOGETHER ALSO LASHING THEM TO THE BODY OF THE SAW HORSE SO THERE SEEMED LITTLE DANGER OF THEIR TUMBLING OFF NOW THROW OPEN THE GATES COMMANDED THE SCARECROW
335-125941-0030 AND WE WILL MAKE A DASH TO LIBERTY OR TO DEATH THE COURTYARD IN WHICH THEY WERE STANDING WAS LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF THE GREAT PALACE WHICH SURROUNDED IT ON ALL SIDES BUT IN ONE PLACE A PASSAGE LED TO AN OUTER GATEWAY
335-125941-0031 IT WAS THROUGH THIS GATEWAY HIS MAJESTY PROPOSED TO ESCAPE AND THE ROYAL ARMY NOW LED THE SAW HORSE ALONG THE PASSAGE
335-125941-0032 OTHERS RAN SCREAMING OUT OF THE WAY AND ONLY ONE OR TWO JABBED THEIR KNITTING NEEDLES FRANTICALLY AT THE ESCAPING PRISONERS
335-125941-0033 WHICH SMARTED FOR AN HOUR AFTERWARD BUT THE NEEDLES HAD NO EFFECT UPON THE SCARECROW OR JACK PUMPKINHEAD WHO NEVER EVEN SUSPECTED THEY WERE BEING PRODDED AS FOR THE SAW HORSE HE MADE A WONDERFUL RECORD UPSETTING A FRUIT CART
335-125941-0034 OVERTURNING SEVERAL MEEK LOOKING MEN AND FINALLY BOWLING OVER THE NEW GUARDIAN OF THE GATE A FUSSY LITTLE FAT WOMAN APPOINTED BY GENERAL JINJUR NOR DID THE IMPETUOUS CHARGER STOP THEN
335-125941-0035 SO THE SAW HORSE CONTINUED HIS WILD CAREER UNCHECKED AND WITH UNABATED SPEED PRESENTLY THEY CAME TO THE BANKS OF A WIDE RIVER
335-125941-0036 AND WITHOUT A PAUSE THE WOODEN STEED GAVE ONE FINAL LEAP AND LAUNCHED THEM ALL IN MID AIR A SECOND LATER THEY WERE ROLLING SPLASHING AND BOBBING ABOUT IN THE WATER
