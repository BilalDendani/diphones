4586-96498-0000 THE REBEL MEANWHILE BILLIE WAS STILL HAUNTING MONA AND SHORTLY WAS ABLE TO TELL THE OTHER THREE THAT FORT HAD CALLED TAKING THE SURGEON OUT IN A MACHINE LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD THEM BOTH
4586-96498-0001 THEY PROCEEDED TO A NEAR BY PARK WHERE A GAME OF AERIAL PUNT BALL WAS ALREADY IN PROGRESS FOOTNOTE THE GAME IS DESCRIBED MORE OR LESS COMPLETELY IN VARIOUS SPORTING PUBLICATIONS
4586-96498-0002 BILLIE TOOK GREAT INTEREST IN THE DARTING PLAY OF THE LITTLE FLYLIKE MACHINES THE ACTION OF THE MECHANICAL CATAPULTS AND THE EASE WITH WHICH THE TWELVE INCH BALL WAS USUALLY CAUGHT IN THE BASKETS
4586-96498-0003 ON THE MACHINES PROWS SHE REPORTED THE SCORE FROM TIME TO TIME IN A MANNER WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE A TELEGRAPHER JEALOUS RETURNING FROM THE GAME MONA AND FORT BECAME PRETTY CONFIDENTIAL
4586-96498-0004 THE NATURAL RESULT OF A COMMON ENTHUSIASM FOR THEIR SIDE WON BUT FORT WAS CONTENT FOR A WHILE TO MERELY WATCH MONA WHO WAS DRIVING
4586-96498-0005 I ASKED YOUR MOTHER MONA WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF ME AS A PROSPECTIVE SON IN LAW THE GIRL WAS IN NO WAY RATTLED I SUPPOSE SHE TOLD YOU THAT IT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHAT SHE MIGHT SAY
4586-96498-0006 DO YOU LOVE ME WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY ME MONA SHE PRETENDED TO BE VERY BUSY WITH THE DRIVING SO THAT BILLIE NEVER KNEW WHETHER FORT LOOKED ANXIOUS OR NOT PRESENTLY MONA SAID I THINK
4586-96498-0007 I RATHER THINK I LIKE YOU TOO WELL TO MARRY YOU WHAT I MEAN IS I'M AFRAID IT WOULD SPOIL YOU MY DEAR BOY YOU'RE TOO WELL SATISFIED WITH YOURSELF I DON'T WANT TO MARRY A MAN WHO IS CONTENT TO FLY AROUND HALF THE TIME
4586-96498-0008 THIS MAKES EVERYTHING VERY DIFFERENT HE DECLARED AND EVEN HIS VOICE WAS ALTERED THERE WAS A DETERMINED PURPOSEFUL RING ABOUT IT WHICH WAS ALTOGETHER UNLIKE HIS USUAL RECKLESS TONES THANKS FOR NOT TELLING MISTER POWART
4586-96498-0009 FORT WENT ON IN THE SAME QUIET WAY CLEARLY I SHOULD TELL HIM MYSELF AND I SHALL AFTER THAT IT IS UP TO ME NEXT INSTANT HE HAD THROWN OFF HIS SERIOUSNESS AND FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FLIGHT
4586-96498-0010 FORT CALLED UPON THE SELF MADE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD I HAVE THE HONOR TO INFORM YOU SAID FORT COMING STRAIGHT TO THE POINT THAT MISS MONA HAS SEEN FIT TO ENCOURAGE MY SUIT
4586-96498-0011 IN SHORT SIR WITH THE STRANGE NEW NOTE OF RESOLUTION IN HIS VOICE I AM YOUR RIVAL FOR HER HAND I THOUGHT IT ONLY RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW POWART TOOK THIS AS HE TOOK EVERYTHING STANDING
4586-96498-0012 YOU ARE CONSIDERATE HE STATED WITH THE FAINTEST TRACE OF SARCASM LET ME CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT BECAUSE OF THE POSITION WHICH RECENT EVENTS HAVE FORCED UPON ME
4586-96498-0013 IT IS QUITE WITHIN MY POWER TO DISPOSE OF YOUR OPPOSITION SIGNIFICANTLY QUITE SO I SHALL APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION ALSO THEN THE ATHLETE PERMITTED HIMSELF A SLIGHT SMILE ON SECOND THOUGHTS HOWEVER
4586-96498-0014 YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO BE OTHER THAN CONSIDERATE IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME NOW MISS MONA WILL NATURALLY THINK OF YOU FOR SHE KNOWS I HAVE COME HERE A SINGLE EXCLAMATION ESCAPED POWART
4586-96498-0015 AND FROM THE LIGHT IN FORT'S EYES VAN EMMON KNEW THAT THE CHIEF WAS SORELY PROVOKED HOWEVER HE SPOKE WITH HIS USUAL COOLNESS AND CERTAINTY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU WILL BE EXEMPT MISTER FORT
4586-96498-0016 FROM THE CONSCRIPTION WHICH IS NOW UNDER WAY I SHALL DO NOTHING THAT MIGHT HINDER YOUR ACTIVITIES IN ANY WAY I TAKE IT EVENLY THAT YOU HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING BIG FORT BOWED
4586-96498-0017 IT IS MY INTENTION TO SET A MARK EVEN FURTHER THAN YOUR OWN SIR FOR THE FIRST TIME POWART LAUGHED IT WAS A REALLY HEARTY LAUGH AS THOUGH FORT'S PREPOSTEROUS BOAST WAS SO UTTERLY RIDICULOUS THAT SARCASM WAS OUT OF PLACE
4586-96498-0018 MISTER FORT WHEN HIS MIRTH HAD SUBSIDED I ONLY WISH YOUR JUDGMENT WAS AS SOUND AS YOUR OPTIMISM TELL ME DO YOU INTEND TO MAKE YOURSELF RULER OF A BIGGER WORLD THAN THIS FORT DROPPED HIS SERIOUSNESS FOR AN INSTANT
4586-96498-0019 TO TELL THE TRUTH POWART I HAVEN'T ANY PLAN AT ALL YET THANKS FOR THE EXEMPTION IN RETURN I ASSURE YOU THAT WHATEVER I DO WILL BE AS TRULY IN THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE AS WHAT YOU HAVE DONE
4586-96498-0020 POWART EYED HIM KEENLY FOR A MOMENT VAN EMMON THOUGHT HE WOULD TRY TO LEARN IF FORT HAD ANY SUSPICIONS BUT HE SAID NOTHING FURTHER THAN A CURT THE AUDIENCE IS ENDED
4586-96498-0021 A FEW MINUTES LATER BILLIE THROUGH MONA KNEW THAT FORT WAS REPORTING PROGRESS HE DID IT BY TELEPHONE THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW HE FINISHED HOPE I DIDN'T ROUSE YOU OUT OF BED
4586-96498-0022 IT WAS NIGHT IN MONA'S PART OF THE WORLD AND BILLIE HAD COME UPON THE GIRL JUST AS SHE WAS PREPARING FOR BED THANK YOU SHE SAID
4586-96498-0023 I WAS JUST ABOUT TO RETIRE GOOD LUCK ANOTHER YAWN AND GOOD HER VOICE CHANGED MISTER FORT SHARPLY POWART'S DECLARATION OF WAR ON ALMA
4586-96498-0024 IS A FRAME UP NEVER MIND HOW I HAPPEN TO KNOW IT IS TRUE THEY ARE NOT PLANNING TO INVADE US AT ALL HE TRUMPED UP THIS AFFAIR IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF DICTATOR WHAT THE ATHLETE WAS ASTOUNDED
4586-96498-0025 ARE YOU SURE OF THIS MONA THE GIRL'S MANNER HAD CHANGED AGAIN I BEG YOUR PARDON SHE INQUIRED VASTLY CONFUSED DID I SAY SOMETHING THAT WHY I AM NOT AWARE MISTER FORT
4586-96498-0026 THAT I HAD SAID ANYTHING MORE THAN GOOD NIGHT YOU AREN'T HIS VOICE WAS STRAINED AND EXCITED MONA YOU JUST NOW SAID SOMETHING OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY SURELY INCREDULOUSLY YOU RECALL SAYING SOMETHING DON'T YOU
4586-96498-0027 THEN HE STATED WITH A SOBERNESS THAT WAS ALMOST STERN MONA YOU TOLD ME SOMETHING WHICH COULD HAVE COME ONLY THROUGH A SUPERNATURAL AGENCY I AM SURE OF IT FROM YOUR MANNER YOU WERE TEMPORARILY POSSESSED HE PAUSED AGAIN
4586-96498-0028 SHE SENSED HIS EARNESTNESS AND SPOKE JUST AS SERIOUSLY IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE I HAVE HEARD OF SUCH THINGS BEFORE I WAS SLEEPY AND THE POINT IS WHAT DID I SAY SHE DEMANDED I DO NOT INTEND TO TELL YOU
4586-96498-0029 WHAT I LEARNED GIVES ME A GREAT ADVANTAGE OVER POWART THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY MORE WOULD BE DISHONORABLE WILL YOU TAKE MY WORD FOR THAT MONA CERTAINLY WITH SWIFT DECISION AND A GRACE THAT BILLIE ENVIED WHEREUPON SHE WENT TO BED
4586-96498-0030 DENYING THAT THE VISITOR WAS MAKING ANY TROUBLE FORT'S TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE HAD DELIGHTED HIM COME AGAIN ANY TIME YOU LIKE WHICH FORT DID THE VERY NEXT DAY AND THIS TIME HE BROUGHT A PACKAGE OF SWEETMEATS
4586-96498-0031 DURING THE EATING OF WHICH THE TWO MEN BECAME PRETTY FRIENDLY YOU'RE DIFFERENT FROM MOST OF THE FOLKS OF YOUR STATION REBLONG FINALLY MADE BOLD TO REMARK ANY HARM IN MY SAYING SO ON THE CONTRARY LAUGHED THE ATHLETE
4586-96498-0032 SECRETARY REPLIED REBLONG A LITTLE DUBIOUSLY WAS FORT A SECRET INVESTIGATOR THEN YOU CAN TELL ME IS THERE ANY DISSATISFACTION ARE THE MEN ENTIRELY CONTENT WITH THEIR TREATMENT
4586-96498-0033 AS HAPPY AS I AM AND THUS FORT DISCOVERED JUST AS ANOTHER MAN HAD ALREADY DISCOVERED THAT THE AVERAGE CAPELLAN WORKMAN WAS ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH WHAT HE KNEW TO BE UNJUST TREATMENT
4586-96498-0034 EVEN WHEN FORT TOLD REBLONG WHAT HE HAD LEARNED ABOUT POWART'S TRICKERY LEAVING OUT ALL DETAILS ABOUT MONA OF COURSE THE ENGINEER WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ANY HINT OF REVOLUTION
4586-96498-0035 I DON'T LIKE TO QUESTION YOUR WORD MISTER FORT REBLONG WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BUT I HAVE SUCH CONFIDENCE IN THE COMMISSION THAT WELL YOU UNDERSTAND AND FORT SAID JUST AS THE OTHER FELLOW HAD SAID AFTER TALKING WITH REBLONG
4586-96498-0036 REBLONG THE REPRESENTATIVE CAPELLAN WORKMAN REBLONG WHO VOICED THE OPINIONS OF HIS BILLIONS OF FELLOW WORKMEN WHEN HE REFUSED TO CONSIDER A REBELLION FORT SAID
