3370-756-0000 AND TO GIVE HER A MESSAGE SHE SAT AND TALKED TO HIM IN THE VERY ROOM IN WHICH SHE HAD ONCE RECEIVED GRUSHENKA IN THE NEXT ROOM IVAN FYODOROVITCH LAY UNCONSCIOUS IN A HIGH FEVER
3370-756-0001 ORDERED THE SICK AND UNCONSCIOUS MAN TO BE CARRIED TO HER HOUSE DISREGARDING THE INEVITABLE GOSSIP AND GENERAL DISAPPROVAL OF THE PUBLIC
3370-756-0002 THE FAMOUS DOCTOR HAD GONE BACK TO MOSCOW REFUSING TO GIVE AN OPINION AS TO THE PROBABLE END OF THE ILLNESS THOUGH THE DOCTORS ENCOURAGED KATERINA IVANOVNA AND ALYOSHA IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY COULD NOT YET GIVE THEM POSITIVE HOPES OF RECOVERY
3370-756-0003 ALYOSHA CAME TO SEE HIS SICK BROTHER TWICE A DAY BUT THIS TIME HE HAD SPECIALLY URGENT BUSINESS AND HE FORESAW HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO APPROACH THE SUBJECT YET HE WAS IN GREAT HASTE HE HAD ANOTHER ENGAGEMENT THAT COULD NOT BE PUT OFF FOR THAT SAME MORNING
3370-756-0004 DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIS DECISION SHE SAID WITH CONFIDENT EMPHASIS TO ALYOSHA ONE WAY OR ANOTHER HE IS BOUND TO COME TO IT HE MUST ESCAPE THAT UNHAPPY MAN THAT HERO OF HONOR AND PRINCIPLE NOT HE
3370-756-0005 I'VE TOLD YOU SOMETHING ALREADY YOU SEE
3370-756-0006 WHEN THE PARTY OF PRISONERS IS BEING TAKEN TO SIBERIA OH IT'S A LONG WAY OFF YET
3370-756-0007 NO I DON'T SAID ALYOSHA OF COURSE HE DID NOT TELL YOU IT WAS ABOUT THAT PLAN OF ESCAPE HE HAD TOLD ME THE MAIN IDEA THREE DAYS BEFORE AND WE BEGAN QUARRELING ABOUT IT AT ONCE AND QUARRELED FOR THREE DAYS WE QUARRELED BECAUSE
3370-756-0008 AND THAT SHE TOO SHOULD GO ABROAD WITH DMITRI KATERINA IVANOVNA EXCLAIMED SUDDENLY HER LIPS QUIVERING WITH ANGER AS SOON AS IVAN FYODOROVITCH SAW THAT I WAS FURIOUS ABOUT THAT WOMAN HE INSTANTLY IMAGINED I WAS JEALOUS OF DMITRI
3370-756-0009 AND THAT I STILL LOVED DMITRI THAT IS HOW OUR FIRST QUARREL BEGAN I WOULD NOT GIVE AN EXPLANATION I COULD NOT ASK FORGIVENESS I COULD NOT BEAR TO THINK THAT SUCH A MAN COULD SUSPECT ME OF STILL LOVING THAT
3370-756-0010 HE BROUGHT ME A SEALED ENVELOPE WHICH I WAS TO OPEN AT ONCE IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO HIM OH HE FORESAW HIS ILLNESS HE TOLD ME THAT THE ENVELOPE CONTAINED THE DETAILS OF THE ESCAPE
3370-756-0011 I WAS TREMENDOUSLY IMPRESSED TO FIND THAT IVAN FYODOROVITCH HAD NOT GIVEN UP HIS IDEA OF SAVING HIS BROTHER AND WAS CONFIDING THIS PLAN OF ESCAPE TO ME THOUGH HE WAS STILL JEALOUS OF ME AND STILL CONVINCED THAT I LOVED MITYA OH THAT WAS A SACRIFICE
3370-756-0012 NO YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE GREATNESS OF SUCH SELF SACRIFICE ALEXEY FYODOROVITCH I WANTED TO FALL AT HIS FEET IN REVERENCE BUT I THOUGHT AT ONCE THAT HE WOULD TAKE IT ONLY FOR MY JOY AT THE THOUGHT OF MITYA'S BEING SAVED
3370-756-0013 AND I WAS SO EXASPERATED AT THE MERE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN UNJUST THOUGHT ON HIS PART THAT I LOST MY TEMPER AGAIN AND INSTEAD OF KISSING HIS FEET FLEW INTO A FURY AGAIN OH I AM UNHAPPY IT'S MY CHARACTER
3370-756-0014 MY AWFUL UNHAPPY CHARACTER OH YOU WILL SEE I SHALL END BY DRIVING HIM TOO TO ABANDON ME FOR ANOTHER WITH WHOM HE CAN GET ON BETTER LIKE DMITRI BUT NO I COULD NOT BEAR IT I SHOULD KILL MYSELF AND WHEN YOU CAME IN THEN
3370-756-0015 HE HAD NEVER NEVER PERSUADED ME THAT HIS BROTHER WAS A MURDERER ON THE CONTRARY IT WAS I WHO PERSUADED HIM OH MY VILE TEMPER WAS THE CAUSE OF EVERYTHING I PAVED THE WAY TO THAT HIDEOUS SCENE AT THE TRIAL
3370-756-0016 HE WANTED TO SHOW ME THAT HE WAS AN HONORABLE MAN AND THAT EVEN IF I LOVED HIS BROTHER HE WOULD NOT RUIN HIM FOR REVENGE OR JEALOUSY SO HE CAME TO THE COURT I AM THE CAUSE OF IT ALL I ALONE AM TO BLAME
3370-756-0017 AND HE FELT THAT SHE WAS NOW AT THAT STAGE OF UNBEARABLE SUFFERING WHEN EVEN THE PROUDEST HEART PAINFULLY CRUSHES ITS PRIDE AND FALLS VANQUISHED BY GRIEF OH ALYOSHA KNEW ANOTHER TERRIBLE REASON OF HER PRESENT MISERY
