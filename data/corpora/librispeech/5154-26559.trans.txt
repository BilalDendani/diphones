5154-26559-0000 HOW THE MONKEY ESCAPED BEING EATEN ONCE UPON A TIME
5154-26559-0001 THEN THERE CAME A TIME WHEN THE FRUITS AND NUTS BECAME SCARCE PEOPLE HAD TO EAT MEAT SO THEY BEGAN KILLING THE VARIOUS BEASTS TO SEE WHICH ONES WERE THE BEST TO EAT THEY SKINNED THEM AND CUT THEM IN PIECES AND COOKED THEM OVER THE FIRE
5154-26559-0002 SOME OF THE BEASTS WERE GOOD TO EAT AND OTHERS WERE NOT GOOD AT ALL THE OX WAS FOUND TO BE VERY GOOD
5154-26559-0003 THE MONKEY WAS PLAYING HIS GUITAR
5154-26559-0004 ALL THE TIME THE MAN WAS COMING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE MONKEY JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO STRETCH OUT HIS HAND AND SEIZE THE MONKEY THE MONKEY GAVE A SUDDEN LEAP TO THE TREE AND HURRIED AWAY TO THE TREE TOP AFTER THAT
5154-26559-0005 EVERY TIME THE MAN HEARD THE MONKEY PLAY THE GUITAR HE WOULD COME NEAR AND TRY TO CATCH HIM THE MONKEY GREW AFRAID OF THE MAN SO AFRAID THAT HE GAVE UP PLAYING HIS GUITAR AT ALL
5154-26559-0006 ONE DAY HE FELT THAT HE JUST MUST HAVE SOME MUSIC HE HID IN A HOLE IN THE GROUND AND THERE HE PLAYED UPON HIS GUITAR HE DID NOT THINK THAT THE MAN WOULD HEAR HIM BUT THE MAN HAD VERY SHARP EARS
5154-26559-0007 WHEN HE GOT THROUGH PLAYING HE STARTED TO COME OUT OF THE HOLE IN THE GROUND THERE WAS THE MAN WAITING FOR HIM HE CRAWLED QUICKLY BACK
5154-26559-0008 THE MONKEY WAITED AND WAITED FOR THE MAN TO GO AWAY BUT THE MAN DID NOT GO AWAY AFTER A WHILE THE MAN BECAME THIRSTY AND WENT TO GET A DRINK HE LEFT HIS LITTLE BOY IN HIS PLACE TO WATCH FOR THE MONKEY
5154-26559-0009 JUST PUT YOUR EYES DOWN TO THE DOOR OF MY LITTLE CAVE AND I'LL LET YOU SEE THE MONKEY DANCE LITTLE BOY SAID THE MONKEY THE LITTLE BOY PUT HIS EYES DOWN CLOSE TO THE HOLE IN THE GROUND
5154-26559-0010 WHEN THE LITTLE BOY WAS RUBBING HIS EYES TO GET THE DIRT OUT OF THEM THE MONKEY MADE A SUDDEN DASH OUT OF THE CAVE AND ESCAPED TO THE TREE TOPS WHEN THE MAN RETURNED THE LITTLE BOY DID NOT DARE TO TELL HIM THAT THE MONKEY HAD ESCAPED THE MAN WAITED AND WAITED AND WAITED
5154-26559-0011 THERE BY THE HOLE IN THE GROUND AT LAST HE BECAME TIRED OF WAITING AND WENT AWAY AFTER THAT THE MAN TRIED HARDER THAN EVER TO CATCH THE MONKEY
5154-26559-0012 ONE DAY HOWEVER HE CAUGHT THE MONKEY NAPPING HE SHUT HIM UP IN A BOX AND CARRIED HIM HOME TO THE CHILDREN FOR SUPPER THE MAN PUT A BIG DISH FULL OF WATER OVER THE FIRE READY TO COOK THE MONKEY
5154-26559-0013 THE MONKEY AND HIS GUITAR WERE SHUT UP IN THE BOX AND THERE INSIDE THE BOX THE MONKEY PLAYED ON HIS GUITAR
5154-26559-0014 THE CHILDREN CAME CROWDING CLOSE TO THE BOX O CHILDREN O CHILDREN SAID THE MONKEY DON'T YOU WISH THAT YOU COULD SEE THE MONKEY DANCE THE CHILDREN REPLIED THAT THEY WISHED THEY COULD
5154-26559-0015 SAID THE MONKEY JUST LET ME OUT AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW WELL I CAN DANCE
5154-26559-0016 SO THEY LET THE MONKEY FILL THE POT AS HE LIKED HE PUT INTO IT SOME LITTLE DRY STICKS AND AN EMPTY COCOANUT SHELL THEN HE SAID O CHILDREN O CHILDREN I CANNOT DANCE ANY MORE IT IS SO HOT HERE IN THIS ROOM THE CHILDREN
5154-26559-0017 BEGGED HIM TO DANCE SOME MORE IF YOU WILL OPEN THE DOOR A LITTLE BIT SO THAT I CAN HAVE MORE AIR TO BREATHE I'LL SHOW YOU A NEW DANCE SAID THE MONKEY THE CHILDREN OPENED THE DOOR
5154-26559-0018 THE MONKEY DANCED OVER TO THE DOOR AND OUT OF THE DOOR AWAY TO THE TREE TOP THAT WAS THE LAST THEY EVER SAW OF HIM HE MOVED TO ANOTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY AFTER THAT EXPERIENCE
5154-26559-0019 DARE TO TELL HIM THAT THE MONKEY HAD ESCAPED THEY LET HIM THINK THAT THE STICKS AND THE COCOANUT SHELL IN THE POT WAS THE MONKEY
5154-26559-0020 AFTER THE POT HAD BOILED A WHILE HE CALLED THE CHILDREN TO COME TO SUPPER WITH HIM THE CHILDREN LET HIM TASTE FIRST HE FISHED A HARD STICK OUT OF THE POT AND BIT INTO IT
5154-26559-0021 THIS IS NOT THE MONKEY'S LEG IT IS JUST A DRY STICK HE SAID AS HE MADE A WRY FACE THEN HE FISHED THE EMPTY COCOANUT SHELL OUT OF THE POT THAT IS NOT THE MONKEY'S HEAD HE SAID AS HE TASTED IT
5154-26559-0022 THAT IS JUST AN EMPTY COCOANUT SHELL HE COULDN'T FIND A SINGLE TRACE OF THE MONKEY IN THAT MONKEY STEW
