2769-176256-0000 WHAT WAS HIDDEN UNDER THE FLOOR THE CAB PULLED UP
2769-176256-0001 THE WHOLE PLACE A LIVING MONUMENT OF THE DEFEAT OF THE SPECULATIVE BUILDER ATHERTON LEAPED OUT ON TO THE GRASS GROWN RUBBLE WHICH WAS MEANT FOR A FOOTPATH I DON'T SEE MARJORIE LOOKING FOR ME ON THE DOORSTEP NOR DID I
2769-176256-0002 I SAW NOTHING BUT WHAT APPEARED TO BE AN UNOCCUPIED RAMSHACKLE BRICK ABOMINATION SUDDENLY SYDNEY GAVE AN EXCLAMATION HULLO THE FRONT DOOR'S CLOSED I WAS HARD AT HIS HEELS
2769-176256-0003 IT LOOKS AS IF I'VE MADE AN IDIOT OF MYSELF AFTER ALL AND MARJORIE'S RETURNED LET'S HOPE TO GOODNESS THAT I HAVE HE KNOCKED WHILE WE WAITED FOR A RESPONSE I QUESTIONED HIM WHY DID YOU LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN WHEN YOU WENT I HARDLY KNOW
2769-176256-0004 I IMAGINE THAT IT WAS WITH SOME DIM IDEA OF MARJORIE'S BEING ABLE TO GET IN IF SHE RETURNED WHILE I WAS ABSENT BUT THE TRUTH IS I WAS IN SUCH A CONDITION OF HELTER SKELTER THAT I AM NOT PREPARED TO SWEAR THAT I HAD ANY REASONABLE REASON I SUPPOSE THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT YOU DID LEAVE IT OPEN
2769-176256-0005 WERE THERE ANY SIGNS OF A STRUGGLE NONE THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF ANYTHING EVERYTHING WAS JUST AS I HAD LEFT IT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE RING WHICH I TROD ON IN THE PASSAGE AND WHICH LESSINGHAM HAS
2769-176256-0006 IF MISS LINDON HAS RETURNED IT DOES NOT LOOK AS IF SHE WERE IN THE HOUSE AT PRESENT IT DID NOT UNLESS SILENCE HAD SUCH MEANING ATHERTON HAD KNOCKED LOUDLY THREE TIMES WITHOUT SUCCEEDING IN ATTRACTING THE SLIGHTEST NOTICE FROM WITHIN
2769-176256-0007 IT STRIKES ME THAT THIS IS ANOTHER CASE OF SEEKING ADMISSION THROUGH THAT HOSPITABLE WINDOW AT THE BACK ATHERTON LED THE WAY TO THE REAR LESSINGHAM AND I FOLLOWED
2769-176256-0008 THERE WAS NOT EVEN A FENCE OF ANY SORT TO SERVE AS AN ENCLOSURE AND TO SHUT OFF THE HOUSE FROM THE WILDERNESS OF WASTE LAND THE KITCHEN WINDOW WAS OPEN I ASKED SYDNEY IF HE HAD LEFT IT SO I DON'T KNOW I DARE SAY WE DID
2769-176256-0009 I DON'T FANCY THAT EITHER OF US STOOD ON THE ORDER OF HIS COMING WHILE HE SPOKE HE SCRAMBLED OVER THE SILL WE FOLLOWED WHEN HE WAS IN HE SHOUTED AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE MARJORIE MARJORIE SPEAK TO ME MARJORIE IT IS I SYDNEY
2769-176256-0010 THE WORDS ECHOED THROUGH THE HOUSE ONLY SILENCE ANSWERED HE LED THE WAY TO THE FRONT ROOM SUDDENLY HE STOPPED HOLLO HE CRIED THE BLIND'S DOWN I HAD NOTICED WHEN WE WERE OUTSIDE THAT THE BLIND WAS DOWN AT THE FRONT ROOM WINDOW
2769-176256-0011 IT WAS UP WHEN I WENT THAT I'LL SWEAR THAT SOMEONE HAS BEEN HERE IS PRETTY PLAIN LET'S HOPE IT'S MARJORIE
2769-176256-0012 MY STARS HERE'S A SUDDEN CLEARANCE WHY THE PLACE IS EMPTY EVERYTHING'S CLEAN GONE
2769-176256-0013 ATHERTON WAS STARING ABOUT HIM AS IF HE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO CREDIT THE EVIDENCE OF HIS OWN EYES HOW LONG AGO IS IT SINCE YOU LEFT HE REFERRED TO HIS WATCH SOMETHING OVER AN HOUR POSSIBLY AN HOUR AND A HALF
2769-176256-0014 I COULDN'T SWEAR TO THE EXACT MOMENT BUT IT CERTAINLY ISN'T MORE DID YOU NOTICE ANY SIGNS OF PACKING UP NOT A SIGN GOING TO THE WINDOW HE DREW UP THE BLIND SPEAKING AS HE DID SO
2769-176256-0015 THE QUEER THING ABOUT THIS BUSINESS IS THAT WHEN WE FIRST GOT IN THIS BLIND WOULDN'T DRAW UP A LITTLE BIT SO SINCE IT WOULDN'T GO UP I PULLED IT DOWN ROLLER AND ALL
2769-176256-0016 STANDING AT SYDNEY'S BACK I SAW THAT THE CABMAN ON HIS BOX WAS SIGNALLING TO US WITH HIS OUTSTRETCHED HAND SYDNEY PERCEIVED HIM TOO HE THREW UP THE SASH WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU
2769-176256-0017 I FOLLOWED RATHER MORE SOBERLY HIS METHODS WERE A LITTLE TOO FLIGHTY FOR ME WHEN I REACHED THE LANDING DASHING OUT OF THE FRONT ROOM HE RUSHED INTO THE ONE AT THE BACK THEN THROUGH A DOOR AT THE SIDE HE CAME OUT SHOUTING
2769-176256-0018 WHAT'S THE IDIOT MEAN WITH HIS OLD GENT I'D OLD GENT HIM IF I GOT HIM THERE'S NOT A CREATURE ABOUT THE PLACE HE RETURNED INTO THE FRONT ROOM I AT HIS HEELS THAT CERTAINLY WAS EMPTY
2769-176256-0019 AND NOT ONLY EMPTY BUT IT SHOWED NO TRACES OF RECENT OCCUPATION THE DUST LAY THICK UPON THE FLOOR THERE WAS THAT MOULDY EARTHY SMELL WHICH IS SO FREQUENTLY FOUND IN APARTMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN LONG UNTENANTED ARE YOU SURE ATHERTON THAT THERE IS NO ONE AT THE BACK
2769-176256-0020 JEHU'S DRUNK THROWING UP THE SASH HE ADDRESSED THE DRIVER WHAT DO YOU MEAN WITH YOUR OLD GENT AT THE WINDOW WHAT WINDOW THAT WINDOW SIR GO TO YOU'RE DREAMING MAN THERE'S NO ONE HERE
2769-176256-0021 BEGGING YOUR PARDON SIR BUT THERE WAS SOMEONE THERE NOT A MINUTE AGO IMAGINATION CABMAN THE SLANT OF THE LIGHT ON THE GLASS OR YOUR EYESIGHT'S DEFECTIVE EXCUSE ME SIR BUT IT'S NOT MY IMAGINATION AND MY EYESIGHT'S AS GOOD AS ANY MAN'S IN ENGLAND
2769-176256-0022 AND AS FOR THE SLANT OF THE LIGHT ON THE GLASS THERE AIN'T MUCH GLASS FOR THE LIGHT TO SLANT ON I SAW HIM PEEPING THROUGH THAT BOTTOM BROKEN PANE ON YOUR LEFT HAND AS PLAINLY AS I SEE YOU
2769-176256-0023 HE'S AT THE BACK AIN'T THERE A CUPBOARD NOR NOTHING WHERE HE COULD HIDE THE CABMAN'S MANNER WAS SO EXTREMELY EARNEST THAT I WENT MYSELF TO SEE THERE WAS A CUPBOARD ON THE LANDING BUT THE DOOR OF THAT STOOD WIDE OPEN AND THAT OBVIOUSLY WAS BARE
2769-176256-0024 THE ROOM BEHIND WAS SMALL AND DESPITE THE SPLINTERED GLASS IN THE WINDOW FRAME STUFFY FRAGMENTS OF GLASS KEPT COMPANY WITH THE DUST ON THE FLOOR TOGETHER WITH A CHOICE COLLECTION OF STONES BRICKBATS AND OTHER MISSILES WHICH NOT IMPROBABLY WERE THE CAUSE OF THEIR BEING THERE
2769-176256-0025 IN THE CORNER STOOD A CUPBOARD BUT A MOMENTARY EXAMINATION SHOWED THAT THAT WAS AS BARE AS THE OTHER THE DOOR AT THE SIDE WHICH SYDNEY HAD LEFT WIDE OPEN OPENED ON TO A CLOSET AND THAT WAS EMPTY I GLANCED UP
2769-176256-0026 THERE WAS NO TRAP DOOR WHICH LED TO THE ROOF NO PRACTICABLE NOOK OR CRANNY IN WHICH A LIVING BEING COULD LIE CONCEALED WAS ANYWHERE AT HAND
2769-176256-0027 HOW COULD YOU SEE WHAT WASN'T THERE THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW AS I DROVE UP BEFORE YOU TOLD ME TO STOP I SAW HIM LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW THE ONE AT WHICH YOU ARE HE'D GOT HIS NOSE GLUED TO THE BROKEN PANE AND WAS STARING AS HARD AS HE COULD STARE
2769-176256-0028 AND I SUPPOSED THAT HE WASN'T SO ANXIOUS TO LET YOU IN AS YOU MIGHT BE TO GET INSIDE
2769-176256-0029 OR THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN BUT WHEN YOU PULLS UP THE BLIND DOWNSTAIRS
2769-176256-0030 HE SHOVES HIS OLD NOSE RIGHT THROUGH THE SMASH IN THE PANE AND WAGS HIS OLD HEAD AT ME LIKE A CHATTERING MAGPIE THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO ME QUITE THE CIVIL THING TO DO I HADN'T DONE NO HARM TO HIM SO I GIVES YOU THE OFFICE AND LETS YOU KNOW THAT HE WAS THERE
2769-176256-0031 BUT FOR YOU TO SAY THAT HE WASN'T THERE AND NEVER HAD BEEN BLIMEY THAT COPS THE BISCUIT IF HE WASN'T THERE ALL I CAN SAY IS I AIN'T HERE AND MY ORSE AIN'T HERE AND MY CAB AIN'T NEITHER DAMN IT THE HOUSE AIN'T HERE AND NOTHING AIN'T
2769-176256-0032 THAT THE MAN WAS SERIOUS WAS UNMISTAKABLE AS HE HIMSELF SUGGESTED WHAT INDUCEMENT COULD HE HAVE HAD TO TELL A LIE LIKE THAT THAT HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO HAVE SEEN WHAT HE DECLARED HE SAW WAS PLAIN BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
2769-176256-0033 WHAT COULD HAVE BECOME IN THE SPACE OF FIFTY SECONDS OF HIS OLD GENT ATHERTON PUT A QUESTION WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE THIS OLD GENT OF YOURS WELL THAT I SHOULDN'T HARDLY LIKE TO SAY
2769-176256-0034 IT WASN'T MUCH OF HIS FACE I COULD SEE ONLY HIS FACE AND HIS EYES AND THEY WASN'T PRETTY HE KEPT A THING OVER HIS HEAD ALL THE TIME AS IF HE DIDN'T WANT TOO MUCH TO BE SEEN
2769-176256-0035 WHY ONE OF THEM CLOAK SORT OF THINGS LIKE THEM ARAB BLOKES USED TO WEAR WHAT USED TO BE AT EARL'S COURT EXHIBITION YOU KNOW THIS PIECE OF INFORMATION SEEMED TO INTEREST MY COMPANIONS MORE THAN ANYTHING HE HAD SAID BEFORE A BURNOOSE DO YOU MEAN
2769-176256-0036 HOW AM I TO KNOW WHAT THE THING'S CALLED I AIN'T UP IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES
2769-176256-0037 WHEN HE GETS OFF HIS KNEES TO SNEAK AWAY FROM THE WINDOW I COULD SEE THAT HE HAD HIS CLOAK THING WHAT WAS OVER HIS HEAD WRAPPED ALL ROUND HIM MISTER LESSINGHAM TURNED TO ME ALL QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT I BELIEVE THAT WHAT HE SAYS IS TRUE
2769-176256-0038 THEN WHERE CAN THIS MYSTERIOUS OLD GENTLEMAN HAVE GOT TO CAN YOU SUGGEST AN EXPLANATION IT IS STRANGE TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT THAT THE CABMAN SHOULD BE THE ONLY PERSON TO SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING OF HIM SOME DEVIL'S TRICK HAS BEEN PLAYED
2769-176256-0039 I KNOW IT I FEEL IT MY INSTINCT TELLS ME SO I STARED IN SUCH A MATTER ONE HARDLY EXPECTS A MAN OF PAUL LESSINGHAM'S STAMP TO TALK OF INSTINCT ATHERTON STARED TOO THEN ON A SUDDEN HE BURST OUT
2769-176256-0040 BY THE LORD I BELIEVE THE APOSTLE'S RIGHT THE WHOLE PLACE REEKS TO ME OF HANKEY PANKEY IT DID AS SOON AS I PUT MY NOSE INSIDE IN MATTERS OF PRESTIDIGITATION CHAMPNELL WE WESTERNS ARE AMONG THE RUDIMENTS
2769-176256-0041 WE'VE EVERYTHING TO LEARN ORIENTALS LEAVE US AT THE POST IF THEIR CIVILISATION'S WHAT WE'RE PLEASED TO CALL EXTINCT THEIR CONJURING WHEN YOU GET TO KNOW IT IS ALL ALIVE OH HE MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR
2769-176256-0042 HAVING REMOVED IT WE PEERED INTO THE CAVITY IT DISCLOSED THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE
