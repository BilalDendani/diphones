6269-66176-0000 THE SNOW FORT ON SLATTER'S HILL THE MEMORY OF MAN EVEN THAT OF THE OLDEST INHABITANT RUNNETH NOT BACK TO THE TIME WHEN THERE DID NOT EXIST A FEUD BETWEEN THE NORTH END AND THE SOUTH END BOYS OF RIVERMOUTH
6269-66176-0001 THE ORIGIN OF THE FEUD IS INVOLVED IN MYSTERY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHICH PARTY WAS THE FIRST AGGRESSOR IN THE FAR OFF ANTEREVOLUTIONARY AGES
6269-66176-0002 ENTERTAINED A MORTAL HATRED FOR EACH OTHER AND THAT THIS HATRED HAD BEEN HANDED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION LIKE MILES STANDISH'S PUNCH BOWL I KNOW NOT WHAT LAWS NATURAL OR UNNATURAL REGULATED THE WARMTH OF THE QUARREL
6269-66176-0003 THIS WINTER BOTH PARTIES WERE UNUSUALLY LIVELY AND ANTAGONISTIC GREAT WAS THE WRATH OF THE SOUTH ENDERS WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE NORTH ENDERS HAD THROWN UP A FORT ON THE CROWN OF SLATTER'S HILL SLATTER'S HILL
6269-66176-0004 OR NO MAN'S LAND AS IT WAS GENERALLY CALLED WAS A RISE OF GROUND COVERING PERHAPS AN ACRE AND A QUARTER SITUATED ON AN IMAGINARY LINE MARKING THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE TWO DISTRICTS AN IMMENSE STRATUM OF GRANITE
6269-66176-0005 WHICH HERE AND THERE THRUST OUT A WRINKLED BOULDER PREVENTED THE SITE FROM BEING USED FOR BUILDING PURPOSES THE STREET RAN ON EITHER SIDE OF THE HILL FROM ONE PART OF WHICH A QUANTITY OF ROCK HAD BEEN REMOVED TO FORM THE UNDERPINNING OF THE NEW JAIL
6269-66176-0006 THIS EXCAVATION MADE THE APPROACH FROM THAT POINT ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE RAGGED LEDGES WERE A GLITTER WITH ICE
6269-66176-0007 FLOATING DEFIANTLY FROM THE FLAG STAFF IN LESS THAN AN HOUR IT WAS KNOWN ALL OVER TOWN IN MILITARY CIRCLES AT LEAST THAT THE PUDDLE DOCKERS AND THE RIVER RATS
6269-66176-0008 THESE WERE THE DERISIVE SUB TITLES BESTOWED ON OUR SOUTH END FOES INTENDED TO ATTACK THE FORT THAT SATURDAY AFTERNOON AT TWO O'CLOCK ALL THE FIGHTING BOYS OF THE TEMPLE GRAMMAR SCHOOL AND AS MANY RECRUITS AS WE COULD MUSTER
6269-66176-0009 LAY BEHIND THE WALLS OF FORT SLATTER WITH THREE HUNDRED COMPACT SNOWBALLS PILED UP IN PYRAMIDS AWAITING THE APPROACH OF THE ENEMY THE ENEMY WAS NOT SLOW IN MAKING HIS APPROACH FIFTY STRONG
6269-66176-0010 HEADED BY ONE MAT AMES OUR FORCES WERE UNDER THE COMMAND OF GENERAL J HARRIS BEFORE THE ACTION COMMENCED
6269-66176-0011 IT WAS STIPULATED THAT THE SOUTH ENDERS SHOULD ASSAULT IT ONLY ON WEDNESDAY AND SATURDAY AFTERNOONS BETWEEN THE HOURS OF TWO AND SIX FOR THEM TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE PLACE AT ANY OTHER TIME WAS NOT TO CONSTITUTE A CAPTURE
6269-66176-0012 BUT ON THE CONTRARY WAS TO BE CONSIDERED A DISHONORABLE AND COWARDLY ACT THE NORTH ENDERS ON THE OTHER HAND AGREED TO GIVE UP THE FORT
6269-66176-0013 A FOOTING ON THE PARAPET AND WERE ABLE TO HOLD THE SAME FOR THE SPACE OF TWO MINUTES
6269-66176-0014 NOR WAS IT PERMISSIBLE TO USE FROZEN AMMUNITION A SNOW BALL SOAKED IN WATER AND LEFT OUT TO COOL WAS A PROJECTILE WHICH IN PREVIOUS YEARS HAD BEEN RESORTED TO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS THESE PRELIMINARIES SETTLED
6269-66176-0015 THE COMMANDERS RETIRED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CORPS THE INTERVIEW HAD TAKEN PLACE ON THE HILLSIDE BETWEEN THE OPPOSING LINES GENERAL HARRIS DIVIDED HIS MEN INTO TWO BODIES THE FIRST COMPRISED THE MOST SKILFUL MARKSMEN
6269-66176-0016 OR GUNNERS THE SECOND THE RESERVE FORCE
6269-66176-0017 WAS COMPOSED OF THE STRONGEST BOYS WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO REPEL THE SCALING PARTIES AND TO MAKE OCCASIONAL SALLIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF CAPTURING PRISONERS WHO WERE BOUND BY THE ARTICLES OF TREATY TO FAITHFULLY SERVE UNDER OUR FLAG UNTIL THEY WERE EXCHANGED
6269-66176-0018 THE REPELLERS WERE CALLED LIGHT INFANTRY BUT WHEN THEY CARRIED ON OPERATIONS BEYOND THE FORT THEY BECAME CAVALRY IT WAS ALSO THEIR DUTY WHEN NOT OTHERWISE ENGAGED TO MANUFACTURE SNOW BALLS THE GENERAL'S STAFF CONSISTED OF FIVE TEMPLARS
6269-66176-0019 I AMONG THE NUMBER WITH THE RANK OF MAJOR WHO CARRIED THE GENERAL'S ORDERS AND LOOKED AFTER THE WOUNDED GENERAL MAT AMES A VETERAN COMMANDER WAS NO LESS WIDE AWAKE IN THE DISPOSITION OF HIS ARMY FIVE COMPANIES
6269-66176-0020 EACH NUMBERING BUT SIX MEN IN ORDER NOT TO PRESENT TOO BIG A TARGET TO OUR SHARPSHOOTERS WERE TO CHARGE THE FORT FROM DIFFERENT POINTS THEIR ADVANCE BEING COVERED BY A HEAVY FIRE FROM THE GUNNERS POSTED IN THE REAR
6269-66176-0021 EACH SCALER WAS PROVIDED WITH ONLY TWO ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION WHICH WERE NOT TO BE USED UNTIL HE HAD MOUNTED THE BREASTWORK AND COULD DELIVER HIS SHOTS ON OUR HEADS
6269-66176-0022 A SINGLE BALL FROM THE DEXTEROUS BAND OF GENERAL HARRIS TAKING GENERAL AMES IN THE VERY PIT OF HIS STOMACH A CHEER WENT UP FROM FORT SLATTER
6269-66176-0023 IN AN INSTANT THE AIR WAS THICK WITH FLYING MISSILES IN THE MIDST OF WHICH WE DIMLY DESCRIED THE STORMING PARTIES SWEEPING UP THE HILL SHOULDER TO SHOULDER THE SHOUTS OF THE LEADERS AND THE SNOWBALLS BURSTING LIKE SHELLS ABOUT OUR EARS MADE IT VERY LIVELY
6269-66176-0024 NOT MORE THAN A DOZEN OF THE ENEMY SUCCEEDED IN REACHING THE CREST OF THE HILL FIVE OF THESE CLAMBERED UPON THE ICY WALLS WHERE THEY WERE INSTANTLY GRABBED BY THE LEGS AND JERKED INTO THE FORT THE REST RETIRED CONFUSED AND BLINDED BY OUR WELL DIRECTED FIRE
6269-66176-0025 SAID SOLDIERS I AM PROUD OF YOU MY HEART SWELLED IN MY BOSOM
6269-66176-0026 SIX NORTH ENDERS HAVING RUSHED OUT TO HARASS THE DISCOMFITED ENEMY WERE GALLANTLY CUT OFF BY GENERAL AMES AND CAPTURED AMONG THESE WERE LIEUTENANT P WHITCOMB
6269-66176-0027 OF GENERAL HARRIS'S STAFF WHITCOMB WAS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE SHOTS ON OUR SIDE THOUGH HE WAS NOT MUCH TO BOAST OF IN A ROUGH AND TUMBLE FIGHT OWING TO THE WEAKNESS BEFORE MENTIONED GENERAL AMES PUT HIM AMONG THE GUNNERS
6269-66176-0028 AND WE WERE QUICKLY MADE AWARE OF THE LOSS WE HAD SUSTAINED BY RECEIVING A FREQUENT ARTFUL BALL WHICH SEEMED TO LIGHT WITH UNERRING INSTINCT ON ANY NOSE THAT WAS THE LEAST BIT EXPOSED
6269-66176-0029 FIRED POINTBLANK TO TURN A CORNER AND HIT A BOY WHO CONSIDERED HIMSELF ABSOLUTELY SAFE BUT WE HAD NO TIME FOR VAIN REGRETS THE BATTLE RAGED ALREADY THERE WERE TWO BAD CASES OF BLACK EYE
6269-66176-0030 AND ONE OF NOSEBLEED IN THE HOSPITAL IT WAS GLORIOUS EXCITEMENT THOSE PELL MELL ONSLAUGHTS AND HAND TO HAND STRUGGLES TWICE WE WERE WITHIN AN ACE OF BEING DRIVEN FROM OUR STRONGHOLD WHEN GENERAL HARRIS AND HIS STAFF
6269-66176-0031 LEAPED RECKLESSLY UPON THE RAMPARTS AND HURLED THE BESIEGERS HEELS OVER HEAD DOWN HILL AT SUNSET THE GARRISON OF FORT SLATTER WAS STILL UNCONQUERED AND THE SOUTH ENDERS IN A SOLID PHALANX MARCHED OFF WHISTLING
6269-66176-0032 YANKEE DOODLE WHILE WE CHEERED AND JEERED THEM UNTIL THEY WERE OUT OF HEARING GENERAL AMES REMAINED BEHIND TO EFFECT AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS WE HELD THIRTEEN OF HIS MEN AND HE ELEVEN OF OURS
6269-66176-0033 GENERAL AMES PROPOSED TO CALL IT AN EVEN THING SINCE MANY OF HIS ELEVEN PRISONERS WERE OFFICERS WHILE NEARLY ALL OUR THIRTEEN CAPTIVES WERE PRIVATES A DISPUTE ARISING ON THIS POINT
6269-66176-0034 THE TWO NOBLE GENERALS CAME TO FISTICUFFS AND IN THE FRACAS OUR BRAVE COMMANDER GOT HIS REMAINING WELL EYE BADLY DAMAGED THIS DIDN'T PREVENT HIM FROM WRITING A GENERAL ORDER THE NEXT DAY ON A SLATE IN WHICH HE COMPLIMENTED THE TROOPS
6269-66176-0035 ON THEIR HEROIC BEHAVIOR ON THE FOLLOWING WEDNESDAY THE SIEGE WAS RENEWED I FORGET WHETHER IT WAS ON THAT AFTERNOON OR THE NEXT THAT WE LOST FORT SLATTER BUT LOSE IT WE DID WITH MUCH VALUABLE AMMUNITION AND SEVERAL MEN
6269-66176-0036 WE FORCED GENERAL AMES TO CAPITULATE
6269-66176-0037 GENERAL AMES HANDLED HIS MEN WITH GREAT SKILL HIS DEADLIEST FOE COULD NOT DENY THAT ONCE HE OUTGENERALLED OUR COMMANDER IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER HE MASSED HIS GUNNERS ON OUR LEFT AND OPENED A BRISK FIRE
6269-66176-0038 UNDER COVER OF WHICH A SINGLE COMPANY SIX MEN ADVANCED ON THAT ANGLE OF THE FORT OUR RESERVES ON THE RIGHT RUSHED OVER TO DEFEND THE THREATENED POINT MEANWHILE FOUR COMPANIES OF THE ENEMY'S SCALERS
6269-66176-0039 MADE A DETOUR ROUND THE FOOT OF THE HILL AND DASHED INTO FORT SLATTER WITHOUT OPPOSITION AT THE SAME MOMENT GENERAL AMES'S GUNNERS CLOSED IN ON OUR LEFT AND THERE WE WERE BETWEEN TWO FIRES OF COURSE WE HAD TO VACATE THE FORT
6269-66176-0040 A CLOUD RESTED ON GENERAL HARRIS'S MILITARY REPUTATION UNTIL HIS SUPERIOR TACTICS ENABLED HIM TO DISPOSSESS THE ENEMY
6269-66176-0041 AT LENGTH THE PROVISION AGAINST USING HEAVY SUBSTANCES IN THE SNOW BALLS WAS DISREGARDED A BALL STUCK FULL OF SAND BIRD SHOT CAME TEARING INTO FORT SLATTER IN RETALIATION GENERAL HARRIS ORDERED A BROADSIDE OF SHELLS
6269-66176-0042 AFTER THIS BOTH SIDES NEVER FAILED TO FREEZE THEIR AMMUNITION IT WAS NO LONGER CHILD'S PLAY TO MARCH UP TO THE WALLS OF FORT SLATTER NOR WAS THE POSITION OF THE BESIEGED LESS PERILOUS AT EVERY ASSAULT THREE OR FOUR BOYS
6269-66176-0043 ON EACH SIDE WERE DISABLED IT WAS NOT AN INFREQUENT OCCURRENCE FOR THE COMBATANTS TO HOLD UP A FLAG OF TRUCE WHILE THEY REMOVED SOME INSENSIBLE COMRADE
6269-66176-0044 MATTERS GREW WORSE AND WORSE SEVEN NORTH ENDERS HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY WOUNDED AND A DOZEN SOUTH ENDERS WERE REPORTED ON THE SICK LIST THE SELECTMEN OF THE TOWN AWOKE TO THE FACT OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AND DETAILED A POSSE OF POLICE
6269-66176-0045 TO PREVENT FURTHER DISTURBANCE THE BOYS AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL SOUTH ENDERS AS IT HAPPENED FINDING THEMSELVES ASSAILED IN THE REAR AND ON THE FLANK TURNED ROUND AND ATTEMPTED TO BEAT OFF THE WATCHMEN
6269-66176-0046 IN THIS THEY WERE SUSTAINED BY NUMEROUS VOLUNTEERS FROM THE FORT WHO LOOKED UPON THE INTERFERENCE AS TYRANNICAL THE WATCH WERE DETERMINED FELLOWS AND CHARGED THE BOYS VALIANTLY DRIVING THEM ALL INTO THE FORT WHERE WE MADE COMMON CAUSE
6269-66176-0047 FIGHTING SIDE BY SIDE LIKE THE BEST OF FRIENDS IN VAIN THE FOUR GUARDIANS OF THE PEACE RUSHED UP THE HILL FLOURISHING THEIR CLUBS AND CALLING UPON US TO SURRENDER THEY COULD NOT GET WITHIN TEN YARDS OF THE FORT OUR FIRE WAS SO DESTRUCTIVE
6269-66176-0048 IN ONE OF THE ONSETS A MAN NAMED MUGRIDGE MORE VALOROUS THAN HIS PEERS THREW HIMSELF UPON THE PARAPET WHEN HE WAS SEIZED BY TWENTY PAIRS OF HANDS AND DRAGGED INSIDE THE BREASTWORK WHERE FIFTEEN BOYS SAT DOWN ON HIM TO KEEP HIM QUIET
6269-66176-0049 THE WATCH SENT FOR REINFORCEMENTS THEIR CALL WAS RESPONDED TO NOT ONLY BY THE WHOLE CONSTABULARY FORCE EIGHT MEN BUT BY A NUMEROUS BODY OF CITIZENS WHO HAD BECOME ALARMED AT THE PROSPECT OF A RIOT
6269-66176-0050 THIS FORMIDABLE ARRAY BROUGHT US TO OUR SENSES WE BEGAN TO THINK THAT MAYBE DISCRETION WAS THE BETTER PART OF VALOR GENERAL HARRIS AND GENERAL AMES WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE STAFFS HELD A COUNCIL OF WAR IN THE HOSPITAL
6269-66176-0051 THE EVENT PASSED INTO A LEGEND AND AFTERWARDS WHEN LATER INSTANCES OF PLUCK AND ENDURANCE WERE SPOKEN OF THE BOYS WOULD SAY
