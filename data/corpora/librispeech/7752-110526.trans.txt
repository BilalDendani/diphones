7752-110526-0000 ONE DAY WHILE HE WAS OUT HUNTING A LITTLE RABBIT THAT HIS DOGS WERE ABOUT TO KILL THREW ITSELF INTO HIS ARMS THE KING CARESSED THE LITTLE CREATURE AND SAID
7752-110526-0001 AND HE CARRIED THE RABBIT TO HIS PALACE AND ORDERED A PRETTY LITTLE HUTCH TO BE MADE FOR IT THAT NIGHT WHEN HE WAS ALONE IN HIS ROOM THERE APPEARED A LOVELY LADY
7752-110526-0002 SHE WORE A ROBE AS WHITE AS SNOW AND A WREATH OF WHITE ROSES ON HER HEAD SHE ADDRESSED HIM THUS
7752-110526-0003 I WISHED TO SEE IF YOU WERE AS GOOD AS EVERYBODY DECLARES YOU ARE AND FOR THIS REASON I CHANGED MYSELF INTO THE LITTLE RABBIT
7752-110526-0004 FOR I KNOW THAT THOSE WHO HAVE PITY FOR DUMB CREATURES HAVE STILL MORE PITY FOR MANKIND I HAVE COME TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID AND TO SAY THAT I SHALL ALWAYS BE YOUR FRIEND
7752-110526-0005 YOU KNOW HE WOULD BE UNHAPPY FOR IT IS ONLY GOODNESS WHICH BRINGS CONTENT YOU ARE RIGHT ANSWERED THE FAIRY BUT THAT I CANNOT DO
7752-110526-0006 ALL THAT I CAN PROMISE IS THAT I WILL GIVE HIM GOOD ADVICE AND PUNISH HIM FOR HIS FAULTS IF HE WILL NOT HIMSELF CORRECT THEM AND WITH THIS THE FATHER HAD TO REST CONTENT NOT LONG AFTERWARDS THE GOOD KING DIED
7752-110526-0007 BUT ONE DAY WHEN HE RETURNED FROM THE CHASE HAVING CAUGHT NOTHING HE FELT SO ILL HUMOURED THAT WHEN HIS DOG BIBI CAME FAWNING UPON HIM HE KICKED THE POOR FAITHFUL CREATURE FROM HIM
7752-110526-0008 I KNOW YOU ARE HIGHER THAN A DOG BUT THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING RULER OF A GREAT EMPIRE IS NOT IN DOING ALL THE HARM ONE WISHES BUT IN DOING ALL THE GOOD ONE CAN
7752-110526-0009 AND ORDERED HIS OFFICERS TO CARRY ZELIE TO THE PALACE BUT SHE WAS NOT USED UNKINDLY THERE FOR THE PRINCE LOVED HER HOWEVER AFTER A WHILE URGED BY HIS FOSTER BROTHER
7752-110526-0010 DETERMINED THAT IF SHE STILL REFUSED TO MARRY HIM
7752-110526-0011 WHILE ALL OTHERS AT THE COURT WERE FULL OF FLATTERY AND PRAISE BUT IN HIS HEART OF HEARTS THE PRINCE RESPECTED THIS GOOD MAN AND THIS THE WICKED FLATTERERS KNEW FULL WELL AND THEREFORE FEARED LEST HE SHOULD COME INTO THE PRINCE'S FAVOUR
7752-110526-0012 I PROMISED YOUR FATHER SAID SHE IN A STERN VOICE TO GIVE YOU GOOD ADVICE AND TO PUNISH YOU IF YOU REFUSED TO FOLLOW IT YOU HAVE DESPISED MY COUNSELS AND YOUR CRIMES HAVE CONVERTED YOU INTO A MONSTER THE HORROR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH
7752-110526-0013 A SERPENT FOR DESTROYING HIM WHO HAS BEEN YOUR SECOND FATHER A BULL
7752-110526-0014 HE HAD A LION'S HEAD A BULL'S HORNS THE FEET OF A WOLF AND THE TAIL OF A VIPER AT THE SAME MOMENT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A FOREST AND THERE AFTER ROAMING ABOUT MISERABLY FOR SOME TIME HE FELL INTO A PIT DUG BY HUNTERS
7752-110526-0015 HE WAS CAPTURED AND LED INTO THE CAPITAL OF HIS KINGDOM ON THE WAY THITHER INSTEAD OF ACKNOWLEDGING THAT HE HAD BROUGHT THIS EVIL PLIGHT UPON HIMSELF HE BIT AT HIS CHAINS AND CURSED THE FAIRY
7752-110526-0016 AS HE WAS NEARING THE CITY GREAT REJOICINGS WERE SEEN ON EVERY SIDE AND ON THE HUNTERS ENQUIRING THE REASON
7752-110526-0017 WHOSE ONLY PLEASURE IT WAS TO TORMENT HIS PEOPLE HAD BEEN CRUSHED TO DEATH IN HIS CHAMBER BY A THUNDER BOLT A JUST PUNISHMENT FOR HIS OFFENCES FOUR OF HIS WICKED COMPANIONS HAD TRIED TO PARTITION THE KINGDOM BETWEEN THEM BUT THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE NONE SUCH TO RULE
7752-110526-0018 AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SHOUTED WITH JOY AND WISHED HIM A LONG LIFE TO REPAIR THE EVIL BROUGHT ABOUT BY THEIR FORMER SOVEREIGN I ACCEPT THE THRONE SAID SULIMAN
7752-110526-0019 AND ONE DAY WHEN THIS KEEPER LAY ASLEEP AND A TIGER WHO HAD BROKEN LOOSE WAS ABOUT TO DEVOUR HIM
7752-110526-0020 ONE DAY HE CARRIED HIS LITTLE PIECE OF BREAD INTO THE GARDEN TO EAT IT THERE BUT WANDERING WITH IT IN HIS MOUTH STILL FURTHER ON
7752-110526-0021 AND ALMOST FAINTING FOR WANT OF FOOD
7752-110526-0022 BUT IF I GIVE MY BREAKFAST TO THIS POOR THING PERHAPS I SHALL SAVE HER LIFE HE PLACED HIS BREAD IN THE GIRL'S HAND AND SHE ATE IT HUNGRILY
7752-110526-0023 THAT SHE NOW ACCEPTED HIS GIFT AND WOULD LOVE HIM ALWAYS
