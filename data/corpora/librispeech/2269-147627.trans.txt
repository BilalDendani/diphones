2269-147627-0000 FRITHIOF THE BOLD FRITHIOF WAS A NORWEGIAN HERO GRANDSON OF VIKING WHO WAS THE LARGEST AND STRONGEST MAN OF HIS TIME VIKING HAD SAILED THE SEA IN A DRAGON SHIP
2269-147627-0001 MEETING WITH MANY ADVENTURES AND THORSTEN FRITHIOF'S FATHER HAD LIKEWISE SAILED ABROAD CAPTURING MANY PRICELESS TREASURES AND MAKING A GREAT NAME FOR HIMSELF
2269-147627-0002 FRITHIOF WAS ENTRUSTED TO THE CARE OF HILDING HIS FOSTER FATHER AND IN HIS CARE ALSO WERE HALFDAN AND HELGE KING
2269-147627-0003 AND AS THE LAD INCREASED IN BRAVERY AND STRENGTH THE GIRL INCREASED IN BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS OF SOUL HILDING NOTICING HOW EACH DAY THEY BECAME FONDER OF EACH OTHER
2269-147627-0004 CALLED FRITHIOF TO HIM AND BADE HIM REMEMBER THAT HE WAS ONLY A HUMBLE SUBJECT AND COULD NEVER HOPE TO WED INGEBORG THE KING'S ONLY DAUGHTER DESCENDED FROM THE GREAT GOD ODIN
2269-147627-0005 FOR FRITHIOF ALREADY LOVED THE FAIR MAIDEN AND VOWED THAT HE WOULD HAVE HER FOR HIS BRIDE AT ANY COST SOON AFTER THIS THE KING DIED LEAVING HIS KINGDOM TO HIS TWO SONS
2269-147627-0006 AND GIVING INSTRUCTIONS THAT HIS FUNERAL MOUND SHOULD BE ERECTED IN SIGHT
2269-147627-0007 WHICH THE KINGS OF SOGN AND THEIR SISTER INGEBORG AMONG MANY OTHER GUESTS ATTENDED FRITHIOF AND INGEBORG WERE MUCH TOGETHER AND FRITHIOF WAS VERY HAPPY TO LEARN THAT INGEBORG RETURNED HIS AFFECTION
2269-147627-0008 GREAT WAS HIS GRIEF WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR HER TO SAIL AWAY NOT LONG HAD SHE BEEN GONE HOWEVER
2269-147627-0009 HIS CHIEF COMPANION THAT HE WOULD FOLLOW AFTER HER AND ASK FOR HER HAND HIS SHIP WAS PREPARED
2269-147627-0010 HIS REQUEST WAS NOT GRANTED AND HELGE DISMISSED HIM CONTEMPTUOUSLY IN A RAGE AT THE INSULT FRITHIOF LIFTED HIS SWORD
2269-147627-0011 HE SPARED THE KING ONLY CUTTING HIS HEAVY SHIELD IN TWO TO SHOW THE STRENGTH OF HIS BLADE SOON AFTER HIS DEPARTURE ANOTHER SUITOR THE AGED KING RING OF NORWAY SOUGHT THE HAND OF INGEBORG IN MARRIAGE
2269-147627-0012 BUT HE HASTENED AT ONCE TO INGEBORG
2269-147627-0013 AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS CONSIDERED A SIN FOR A MAN AND WOMAN TO EXCHANGE WORDS IN THE SACRED TEMPLE HE SPOKE TO HER AGAIN MAKING KNOWN HIS LOVE THE KINGS HER BROTHERS WERE AWAY AT WAR BUT FRITHIOF STAYED NEAR INGEBORG
2269-147627-0014 AND WHEN THEY RETURNED PROMISED TO FREE THEM FROM THE OPPRESSION OF SIGURD RING IF IN RETURN THEY WOULD PROMISE HIM THE HAND OF THEIR SISTER BUT THE KINGS HAD HEARD OF HOW FRITHIOF HAD SPOKEN TO INGEBORG IN THE TEMPLE
2269-147627-0015 AND ALTHOUGH THEY FEARED SIGURD THEY WOULD NOT GRANT THE REQUEST INSTEAD HE WAS CONDEMNED IN PUNISHMENT TO SAIL AWAY TO THE ORKNEY ISLANDS TO CLAIM TRIBUTE FROM THE KING
2269-147627-0016 BIDDING THEM STIR UP SUCH A TEMPEST ON THE SEA THAT EVEN THE GOD GIVEN SHIP ELLIDA COULD NOT WITHSTAND ITS FURY BUT NO TEMPEST COULD FRIGHTEN THE BRAVE FRITHIOF SINGING A CHEERY SONG HE STOOD AT THE HELM
2269-147627-0017 CARING NOTHING FOR THE WAVES THAT RAGED ABOUT THE SHIP HE COMFORTED HIS CREW AND THEN CLIMBED THE MAST TO KEEP A SHARP LOOKOUT FOR DANGER FROM THERE HE SPIED A HUGE WHALE UPON WHICH THE TWO WITCHES WERE SEATED
2269-147627-0018 DELIGHTED AT THE TEMPEST THEY HAD STIRRED UP SPEAKING TO HIS GOOD SHIP WHICH COULD BOTH HEAR AND OBEY HE BADE IT RUN DOWN THE WHALE AND THE WITCHES
2269-147627-0019 WHALE AND WITCHES SANK THE SEA GREW RED WITH THEIR BLOOD THE WAVES WERE CALMED AGAIN THE SUN SMILED OVER THE HARDY SAILORS
2269-147627-0020 BUT MANY OF THE CREW WERE WORN OUT BY THE BATTLE WITH THE ELEMENTS AND HAD TO BE CARRIED ASHORE BY FRITHIOF AND BJOERN WHEN THEY REACHED THE ORKNEY ISLANDS
2269-147627-0021 COULD WEATHER SUCH A STORM ONE OF HIS VASSALS
2269-147627-0022 CAUGHT UP HIS WEAPONS AND HURRIED FORTH TO CHALLENGE THE GREAT HERO FRITHIOF HAD NO WEAPONS BUT WITH A TURN OF HIS WRIST HE THREW HIS OPPONENT GO AND GET YOUR WEAPONS
2269-147627-0023 BUT WHEN HE RETURNED AND FOUND HIS OPPONENT CALMLY AWAITING DEATH HE WAS GENEROUS
2269-147627-0024 ANGANTYR VOWED THAT HE OWED NO TRIBUTE TO HELGE AND WOULD PAY HIM NONE BUT TO FRITHIOF HE GAVE A VAST TREASURE TELLING HIM THAT HE MIGHT DISPOSE OF IT AS HE WOULD SO FRITHIOF
2269-147627-0025 SAILED BACK TO THE KINGS OF SOGN CONFIDENT THAT HE COULD WIN INGEBORG WHAT WAS HIS DISMAY THEREFORE
2269-147627-0026 TO SIGURD RING IN A RAGE HE BADE HIS MEN DESTROY ALL THE VESSELS IN THE HARBOR
2269-147627-0027 WHERE HELGE AND HIS WIFE WERE
2269-147627-0028 AND SEEING THE RING HE HAD GIVEN TO INGEBORG ON THE HAND OF HELGE'S WIFE SNATCHED IT ROUGHLY FROM HER IN TRYING TO GET IT BACK
2269-147627-0029 WHICH SHE HAD JUST BEEN ANOINTING INTO THE FIRE IT WAS QUICKLY CONSUMED WHILE THE RISING FLAMES SET FIRE TO THE TEMPLE HORROR STRICKEN FRITHIOF TRIED TO STOP THE BLAZE AND WHEN HE COULD NOT
2269-147627-0030 HURRIED AWAY TO HIS SHIP SO FRITHIOF BECAME AN EXILE AND A WANDERER ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH
2269-147627-0031 OR VIKING EXACTING TRIBUTE FROM OTHER SHIPS OR SACKING THEM IF THEY WOULD NOT PAY TRIBUTE FOR THIS OCCUPATION IN THE DAYS OF FRITHIOF WAS CONSIDERED WHOLLY RESPECTABLE IT WAS FOLLOWED AGAIN AND AGAIN BY THE BRAVE MEN OF THE NORTH
2269-147627-0032 BUT FRITHIOF WAS OFTEN HOMESICK AND LONGED TO ENTER A HARBOR AND LEAD AGAIN A LIFE OF PEACE AT LAST HE DECIDED TO VISIT THE COURT OF SIGURD RING AND FIND OUT WHETHER INGEBORG WAS REALLY HAPPY
2269-147627-0033 LANDING HE WRAPPED HIMSELF IN AN OLD CLOAK AND APPROACHED THE COURT HE FOUND A SEAT ON A BENCH NEAR THE DOOR AS BEGGARS USUALLY DID
2269-147627-0034 AND SWUNG HIM HIGH OVER HIS HEAD AT THIS SIGURD RING INVITED THE OLD MAN TO REMOVE HIS MANTLE AND TAKE A SEAT NEAR HIM WITH SURPRISE
2269-147627-0035 AND I HAVE GROWN TO MANHOOD IN THE LAND OF SORROW SIGURD INVITED HIM TO REMAIN AND HE SOON BECAME THE ALMOST CONSTANT COMPANION OF THE KING AND QUEEN ONE SPRING DAY
2269-147627-0036 SIGURD AND FRITHIOF HAD RIDDEN AWAY ON A HUNTING EXPEDITION AND THE OLD KING BEING TIRED FROM THE CHASE LAY DOWN ON THE GROUND TO REST FEIGNING SLEEP THE BIRDS AND BEASTS OF THE FOREST
2269-147627-0037 DREW NEAR AND WHISPERED TO FRITHIOF THAT HE SHOULD SLAY THE KING AND HAVE INGEBORG FOR HIS OWN WIFE BUT FRITHIOF WAS TOO FINE AND LOYAL TO LISTEN TO SUCH SUGGESTIONS AWAKING
2269-147627-0038 SIGURD RING CALLED FRITHIOF TO HIM YOU ARE FRITHIOF THE BOLD HE SAID AND FROM THE FIRST I KNEW YOU BE PATIENT NOW A LITTLE LONGER AND YOU SHALL HAVE INGEBORG
2269-147627-0039 FOR MY END IS NEAR SOON AFTER THIS SIGURD DIED COMMENDING HIS WIFE TO THE YOUNG HERO'S LOVING CARE AND AT HIS OWN REQUEST THE FUNERAL FEAST WAS CLOSED BY THE PUBLIC BETROTHAL
2269-147627-0040 OF INGEBORG AND FRITHIOF THE PEOPLE ADMIRING HIS BRAVERY WANTED TO MAKE FRITHIOF KING BUT HE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO THEIR PLEADINGS INSTEAD
2269-147627-0041 AND LATER SO THE STORY RUNS HE RETURNED TO HIS OWN COUNTRY AND BUILT AGAIN THE TEMPLE OF BALDER
