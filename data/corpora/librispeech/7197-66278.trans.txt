7197-66278-0000 OTTER FALLS ON AGAINST HIS WILL
7197-66278-0001 WORKING IN HIM BELIKE THAT THE ROMAN CAPTAIN SET NONE TO GUARD THE FORD ON THE WESTWARD SIDE OF MIRKWOOD WATER THE ROMANS TARRIED THERE BUT A LITTLE HOUR
7197-66278-0002 AND THEN WENT THEIR WAYS BUT OTTER SENT A MAN ON A SWIFT HORSE TO WATCH THEM AND WHEN THEY WERE CLEAN GONE FOR HALF AN HOUR HE BADE HIS FOLK TO HORSE AND THEY DEPARTED
7197-66278-0003 ALL SAVE A HANDFUL OF THE SWAINS AND ELDERS
7197-66278-0004 WHEN HE SHOULD COME INTO MID MARK SO OTTER AND HIS FOLK CROSSED THE FORD AND DREW UP IN GOOD ORDER ON THE WESTWARD BANK AND IT WAS THEN SOMEWHAT MORE THAN THREE HOURS AFTER NOON
7197-66278-0005 WHO HAD GOTTEN OUT OF THE WOOD AND HAD FALLEN IN WITH THE MEN WHOM HE HAD LEFT BEHIND
7197-66278-0006 AND THE WORMINGS FOR THEY HAD OUT GONE THE OTHERS WHO WERE AFOOT IT MAY WELL BE THOUGHT HOW FEARFUL WAS THEIR ANGER WHEN THEY SET EYES ON THE SMOULDERING ASHES OF THE DWELLINGS
7197-66278-0007 NOR EVEN WHEN THOSE FOLK OF OTTER HAD TOLD THEM ALL THEY HAD TO TELL COULD SOME OF THEM REFRAIN THEM FROM RIDING OFF TO THE BURNT HOUSES TO SEEK FOR THE BODIES OF THEIR KINDRED BUT WHEN THEY CAME THERE
7197-66278-0008 AND AMIDST THE ASHES COULD FIND NO BONES THEIR HEARTS WERE LIGHTENED AND YET SO MAD WROTH THEY WERE THAT SOME COULD SCARCE SIT THEIR HORSES AND GREAT TEARS GUSHED FROM THE EYES OF SOME
7197-66278-0009 AND PATTERED DOWN LIKE HAIL STONES
7197-66278-0010 SO THEY RODE BACK TO WHERE THEY HAD LEFT THEIR FOLK TALKING WITH THEM OF OTTER AND THE BEARINGS WERE SITTING GRIM UPON THEIR HORSES AND SOMEWHAT SCOWLING ON OTTER'S MEN
7197-66278-0011 THEN THE FOREMOST OF THOSE WHO HAD COME BACK FROM THE HOUSES WAVED HIS HAND TOWARD THE FORD BUT COULD SAY NOUGHT FOR A WHILE
7197-66278-0012 SPAKE TO THAT MAN AND SAID WHAT AILETH THEE SWEINBIORN THE BLACK WHAT HAST THOU SEEN HE SAID NOW RED AND GREY IS THE PAVEMENT OF THE BEARINGS HOUSE OF OLD
7197-66278-0013 BUT THE HEARTH ALL GREY AND COLD I KNEW NOT THE HOUSE OF MY FATHERS I COULD NOT CALL TO MIND THE FASHION OF THE BUILDING OF THAT WARDER OF THE WIND O WIDE WERE GROWN THE WINDOWS
7197-66278-0014 AND THE ROOF EXCEEDING HIGH FOR NOUGHT THERE WAS TO LOOK ON TWIXT THE PAVEMENT AND THE SKY
7197-66278-0015 AND METHOUGHT ITS STAINING FAIR
7197-66278-0016 AND THE RED FLAME FLICKERED O'ER IT AND NEVER A STAINING WIGHT HATH RED EARTH IN HIS COFFER SO CLEAR AND GLITTERING BRIGHT AND STILL THE LITTLE SMOKE WREATHS CURLED O'ER IT PALE AND BLUE
7197-66278-0017 YEA FAIR IS OUR HALL'S ADORNING FOR A FEAST THAT IS STRANGE AND NEW
7197-66278-0018 WHAT SAWEST THOU THEREIN O SWEINBIORN
7197-66278-0019 WHERE WERE THE BONES OF THY MOTHER LYING SAID SWEINBIORN WE SOUGHT THE FEAST HALL OVER AND NOUGHT WE FOUND THEREIN OF THE BONES OF THE ANCIENT MOTHERS OR THE YOUNGLINGS OF THE KIN
7197-66278-0020 AND WILL TRY IF THE HOARY ELDERS MAY YET OUTLIVE THE WAY THAT LEADS TO THE SOUTHLAND CITIES TILL AT LAST THEY COME TO STAND WITH THE YOUNGLINGS IN THE MARKET TO BE SOLD IN AN ALIEN LAND
7197-66278-0021 AND WE DEEM IT CERTAIN THAT THEY CROSSED THE WATER BEFORE THE COMING OF THE ROMANS AND THAT THEY ARE NOW WITH THE STAY AT HOMES OF THE WOLFINGS IN THE WILD WOOD BEHIND THE WOLFING DWELLINGS FOR WE HEAR TELL THAT THE WAR DUKE
7197-66278-0022 THEN SWEINBIORN TOSSED UP HIS SWORD INTO THE AIR AND CAUGHT IT BY THE HILTS AS IT FELL AND CRIED OUT ON ON TO THE MEADOW WHERE THESE THIEVES ABIDE US
7197-66278-0023 BUT TURNED HIS HORSE AND RODE DOWN TO THE FORD AND ALL MEN FOLLOWED HIM AND OF THE BEARINGS THERE WERE AN HUNDRED WARRIORS SAVE ONE AND OF THE WORMINGS EIGHTY AND SEVEN
7197-66278-0024 SO RODE THEY OVER THE MEADOW AND INTO THE FORD AND OVER IT AND OTTER'S COMPANY STOOD ON THE BANK TO MEET THEM AND SHOUTED TO SEE THEM BUT THE OTHERS MADE BUT LITTLE NOISE AS THEY CROSSED THE WATER
7197-66278-0025 SO WHEN THEY WERE ON THE WESTERN BANK
7197-66278-0026 WHERE THEN IS OTTER WHERE IS THE WAR DUKE IS HE ALIVE OR DEAD AND THE THRONG OPENED TO HIM AND OTTER STOOD FACING HIM
7197-66278-0027 THOU ART ALIVE AND UNHURT WAR DUKE WHEN MANY HAVE BEEN HURT AND SLAIN AND METHINKS THY COMPANY IS LITTLE MINISHED THOUGH THE KINDRED OF THE BEARINGS LACKETH A ROOF
7197-66278-0028 THAT YE STAND HERE WITH CLEAN BLADES AND COLD BODIES SAID OTTER THOU GRIEVEST FOR THE HURT OF THINE HOUSE ARINBIORN BUT THIS AT LEAST IS GOOD
7197-66278-0029 THE SHELL IS GONE BUT THE KERNEL IS SAVED FOR THY FOLK ARE BY THIS TIME IN THE WOOD WITH THE WOLFING STAY AT HOMES
7197-66278-0030 THE ROMANS MAY NOT COME AT THEM TO HURT THEM
7197-66278-0031 HAD YE TIME TO LEARN ALL THIS OTTER WHEN YE FLED SO FAST BEFORE THE ROMANS THAT THE FATHER TARRIED NOT FOR THE SON NOR THE SON FOR THE FATHER HE SPOKE IN A LOUD VOICE SO THAT MANY HEARD HIM
7197-66278-0032 AND SOME DEEMED IT EVIL FOR ANGER AND DISSENSION BETWEEN FRIENDS SEEMED ABROAD BUT SOME WERE SO EAGER FOR BATTLE
7197-66278-0033 AND THEY LAUGHED FOR PRIDE AND ANGER THEN OTTER ANSWERED MEEKLY FOR HE WAS A WISE MAN AND A BOLD WE FLED NOT
7197-66278-0034 BUT AS THE SWORD FLEETH WHEN IT SPRINGETH UP FROM THE IRON HELM TO FALL ON THE WOOLLEN COAT ARE WE NOT NOW OF MORE AVAIL TO YOU O MEN OF THE BEARINGS THAN OUR DEAD CORPSES WOULD HAVE BEEN
7197-66278-0035 AS IF HE WERE STRUGGLING WITH A WEIGHT HARD TO LIFT THEN SAID OTTER
7197-66278-0036 ARINBIORN ANSWERED CALMLY MAYBE IN A LITTLE HOUR FROM NOW OR SOMEWHAT MORE SAID OTTER MY REDE IS THAT WE ABIDE HIM HERE
7197-66278-0037 AND WHEN WE ARE ALL MET AND WELL ORDERED TOGETHER FALL ON THE ROMANS AT ONCE FOR THEN SHALL WE BE MORE THAN THEY WHEREAS NOW WE ARE FAR FEWER AND MOREOVER WE SHALL HAVE TO SET ON THEM IN THEIR GROUND OF VANTAGE
7197-66278-0038 BUT AN OLD MAN OF THE BEARINGS
7197-66278-0039 CAME UP AND SPAKE WARRIORS
7197-66278-0040 THOUGH THIS IS NO HALLOWED THING TO BID US WHAT WE SHALL DO AND WHAT WE SHALL FORBEAR AND TO TALK THUS IS LESS LIKE WARRIORS THAN OLD WOMEN WRANGLING OVER THE WHY AND WHEREFORE OF A BROKEN CROCK
7197-66278-0041 LET THE WAR DUKE RULE HERE AS IS BUT MEET AND RIGHT YET IF I MIGHT SPEAK AND NOT BREAK THE PEACE OF THE GOTHS THEN WOULD I SAY THIS
7197-66278-0042 THAT IT MIGHT BE BETTER FOR US TO FALL ON THESE ROMANS AT ONCE BEFORE THEY HAVE CAST UP A DIKE ABOUT THEM AS FOX TELLETH IS THEIR WONT AND THAT EVEN IN AN HOUR THEY MAY DO MUCH
7197-66278-0043 BUT OTTER SPAKE SHARPLY FOR HE WAS GRIEVED THORBIORN THOU ART OLD AND SHOULDEST NOT BE VOID OF PRUDENCE
7197-66278-0044 THEN THORBIORN REDDENED AND WAS WROTH
7197-66278-0045 LET THE WAR DUKE RULE AS IS BUT RIGHT
7197-66278-0046 AND IF MUCH DIKING SHALL BE DONE IN AN HOUR YET LITTLE SLAYING FORSOOTH SHALL BE DONE AND THAT ESPECIALLY IF THE FOE IS ALL ARMED AND SLAYETH WOMEN AND CHILDREN YEA IF THE BEARING WOMEN BE ALL SLAIN
7197-66278-0047 YET SHALL NOT TYR MAKE US NEW ONES OUT OF THE STONES OF THE WASTE TO WED WITH THE GALTINGS AND THE FISH EATING HOUSES THIS IS EASY TO BE DONE FORSOOTH YEA EASIER THAN FIGHTING THE ROMANS AND OVERCOMING THEM
7197-66278-0048 AND HE WAS VERY WRATH AND TURNED AWAY AND AGAIN THERE WAS A MURMUR AND A HUM ABOUT HIM BUT WHILE THESE HAD BEEN SPEAKING ALOUD
7197-66278-0049 SWEINBIORN HAD BEEN TALKING SOFTLY TO SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEN AND NOW HE SHOOK HIS NAKED SWORD IN THE AIR AND SPAKE ALOUD AND SANG YE TARRY BEARS OF BATTLE
7197-66278-0050 YE LINGER SONS OF THE WORM YE CROUCH ADOWN O KINDREDS FROM THE GATHERING OF THE STORM YE SAY IT SHALL SOON PASS OVER AND WE SHALL FARE AFIELD AND REAP THE WHEAT WITH THE WAR SWORD
7197-66278-0051 WHEN TWIXT THE SNOWY MOUNTAINS AND THE EDGES OF THE SEA THESE MEN HAVE SWEPT THE WILD WOOD AND THE FIELDS WHERE MEN MAY BE OF EVERY LIVING SWORD BLADE AND EVERY QUIVERING SPEAR
7197-66278-0052 AND IN THE SOUTHLAND CITIES THE YOKE OF SLAVES YE BEAR LO YE WHOEVER FOLLOWS I FARE TO SOW THE SEED OF THE DAYS TO BE HEREAFTER AND THE DEED THAT COMES OF DEED THEREWITH
7197-66278-0053 HE WAVED HIS SWORD OVER HIS HEAD AND MADE AS IF HE WOULD SPUR ONWARD
7197-66278-0054 COME YE SONS OF THE BEAR YE CHILDREN OF THE WORM
7197-66278-0055 THEN ON HE RODE NOR LOOKED BEHIND HIM AND THE RIDERS OF THE BEARINGS AND THE WORMINGS DREW THEMSELVES OUT OF THE THRONG AND FOLLOWED HIM AND RODE CLATTERING OVER THE MEADOW TOWARDS WOLFSTEAD
7197-66278-0056 A FEW OF THE OTHERS RODE WITH THEM AND YET BUT A FEW FOR THEY REMEMBERED THE HOLY FOLK MOTE AND THE OATH OF THE WAR DUKE AND HOW THEY HAD CHOSEN OTTER TO BE THEIR LEADER
7197-66278-0057 MAN LOOKED ASKANCE AT MAN AS IF IN SHAME TO BE LEFT BEHIND BUT OTTER BETHOUGHT HIM IN THE FLASH OF A MOMENT IF THESE MEN RIDE ALONE THEY SHALL DIE AND DO NOTHING
7197-66278-0058 AND IF WE RIDE WITH THEM IT MAY BE THAT WE SHALL OVERTHROW THE ROMANS AND IF WE BE VANQUISHED IT SHALL GO HARD BUT WE SHALL SLAY MANY OF THEM
7197-66278-0059 AND BADE CERTAIN MEN ABIDE AT THE FORD FOR A GUARD THEN HE DREW HIS SWORD AND RODE TO THE FRONT OF HIS FOLK AND CRIED OUT ALOUD TO THEM NOW AT LAST HAS COME THE TIME TO DIE
7197-66278-0060 AND LET THEM OF THE MARKMEN WHO LIVE HEREAFTER LAY US IN HOWE SET ON SONS OF TYR AND GIVE NOT YOUR LIVES AWAY BUT LET THEM BE DEARLY EARNED OF OUR FOEMEN
7197-66278-0061 NOR WERE THEY OTHERWISE THAN EXCEEDING GLAD
7197-66278-0062 SAVE THE JOY OF FIGHTING FOR THE KINDRED AND THE DAYS TO BE SO OTTER LED THEM FORTH AND WHEN HE HEARD THE WHOLE COMPANY CLATTERING AND THUNDERING ON THE EARTH BEHIND HIM AND FELT THEIR MIGHT ENTER INTO HIM
7197-66278-0063 HIS BROW CLEARED AND THE ANXIOUS LINES IN THE FACE OF THE OLD MAN SMOOTHED THEMSELVES OUT AND AS HE RODE ALONG THE SOUL SO STIRRED WITHIN HIM THAT HE SANG OUT ALOUD
7197-66278-0064 TIME WAS WHEN HOT WAS THE SUMMER AND I WAS YOUNG ON THE EARTH AND I GRUDGED ME EVERY MOMENT THAT LACKED ITS SHARE OF MIRTH
7197-66278-0065 FOR ME AND MY HEART'S DELIVERANCE THAT HOUR WAS NEWLY WROUGHT I HAVE PASSED THROUGH THE HALLS OF MANHOOD I HAVE REACHED THE DOORS OF ELD AND I HAVE BEEN GLAD AND SORRY BUT EVER HAVE UPHELD
7197-66278-0066 MY HEART AGAINST ALL TROUBLE THAT NONE MIGHT CALL ME SAD BUT NE'ER CAME SUCH REMEMBRANCE OF HOW MY HEART WAS GLAD IN THE AFTERNOON OF SUMMER NEATH THE STILL UNWEARIED SUN OF THE DAYS WHEN I WAS LITTLE
7197-66278-0067 AS NOW AT LAST IT COMETH WHEN E E N IN SUCH LIKE TIDE FOR THE FREEING OF MY TROUBLE O'ER THE FATHERS FIELD I RIDE MANY MEN PERCEIVED THAT HE SANG
7197-66278-0068 AND SAW THAT HE WAS MERRY HOWBEIT FEW HEARD HIS VERY WORDS AND YET ALL WERE GLAD OF HIM FAST THEY RODE BEING WISHFUL TO CATCH UP WITH THE BEARINGS AND THE WORMINGS AND SOON THEY CAME ANIGH THEM
7197-66278-0069 WITH JOYOUS SHOUTING AND LAUGHTER SO THEN THEY ORDERED THE RANKS ANEW AND SO SET FORWARD IN GREAT JOY WITHOUT HASTE OR TURMOIL
