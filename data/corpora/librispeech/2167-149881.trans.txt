2167-149881-0000 CONVENTION'S OWN TINDER BOX THE EYE THAT IS GREEN HURSTWOOD'S RESIDENCE ON THE NORTH SIDE NEAR LINCOLN PARK WAS A BRICK BUILDING OF A VERY POPULAR TYPE THEN
2167-149881-0001 A THREE STORY AFFAIR WITH THE FIRST FLOOR SUNK A VERY LITTLE BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE STREET IT HAD A LARGE BAY WINDOW BULGING OUT FROM THE SECOND FLOOR AND WAS GRACED IN FRONT BY A SMALL GRASSY PLOT TWENTY FIVE FEET WIDE AND TEN FEET DEEP
2167-149881-0002 THERE WAS ALSO A SMALL REAR YARD WALLED IN BY THE FENCES OF THE NEIGHBOURS AND HOLDING A STABLE WHERE HE KEPT HIS HORSE AND TRAP THE TEN ROOMS OF THE HOUSE WERE OCCUPIED BY HIMSELF HIS WIFE JULIA AND HIS SON AND DAUGHTER
2167-149881-0003 AND JESSICA THERE WERE BESIDES THESE A MAID SERVANT REPRESENTED FROM TIME TO TIME BY GIRLS OF VARIOUS EXTRACTION FOR MISSUS HURSTWOOD WAS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO PLEASE GEORGE I LET MARY GO YESTERDAY
2167-149881-0004 WAS NOT AN UNFREQUENT SALUTATION AT THE DINNER TABLE ALL RIGHT WAS HIS ONLY REPLY HE HAD LONG SINCE WEARIED OF DISCUSSING THE RANCOROUS SUBJECT A LOVELY HOME ATMOSPHERE IS ONE OF THE FLOWERS OF THE WORLD
2167-149881-0005 THAN WHICH THERE IS NOTHING MORE TENDER NOTHING MORE DELICATE NOTHING MORE CALCULATED TO MAKE STRONG AND JUST THE NATURES CRADLED AND NOURISHED WITHIN IT THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH A BENEFICENT INFLUENCE
2167-149881-0006 WILL NOT UNDERSTAND WHEREFORE THE TEAR SPRINGS GLISTENING TO THE EYELIDS AT SOME STRANGE BREATH IN LOVELY MUSIC THE MYSTIC CHORDS WHICH BIND AND THRILL THE HEART OF THE NATION THEY WILL NEVER KNOW HURSTWOOD'S RESIDENCE COULD SCARCELY BE SAID TO BE INFUSED WITH THIS HOME SPIRIT
2167-149881-0007 IT LACKED THAT TOLERATION AND REGARD WITHOUT WHICH THE HOME IS NOTHING THERE WAS FINE FURNITURE ARRANGED AS SOOTHINGLY AS THE ARTISTIC PERCEPTION OF THE OCCUPANTS WARRANTED THERE WERE SOFT RUGS RICH UPHOLSTERED CHAIRS AND DIVANS A GRAND PIANO
2167-149881-0008 A MARBLE CARVING OF SOME UNKNOWN VENUS BY SOME UNKNOWN ARTIST AND A NUMBER OF SMALL BRONZES GATHERED FROM HEAVEN KNOWS WHERE BUT GENERALLY SOLD BY THE LARGE FURNITURE HOUSES ALONG WITH EVERYTHING ELSE
2167-149881-0009 EACH MARY SHORTLY AFTER SHE ARRIVED SOMETHING OF WHAT THE ART OF THE THING REQUIRED HE WAS NOT GARRULOUS BY ANY MEANS ON THE CONTRARY THERE WAS A FINE RESERVE IN HIS MANNER TOWARD THE ENTIRE DOMESTIC ECONOMY OF HIS LIFE
2167-149881-0010 WHICH WAS ALL THAT IS COMPREHENDED BY THE POPULAR TERM GENTLEMANLY HE WOULD NOT ARGUE HE WOULD NOT TALK FREELY IN HIS MANNER WAS SOMETHING OF THE DOGMATIST WHAT HE COULD NOT CORRECT HE WOULD IGNORE
2167-149881-0011 THERE WAS A TENDENCY IN HIM TO WALK AWAY FROM THE IMPOSSIBLE THING THERE WAS A TIME WHEN HE HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLY ENAMOURED OF HIS JESSICA ESPECIALLY WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER AND MORE CONFINED IN HIS SUCCESS NOW HOWEVER
2167-149881-0012 IN HER SEVENTEENTH YEAR JESSICA HAD DEVELOPED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RESERVE AND INDEPENDENCE WHICH WAS NOT INVITING TO THE RICHEST FORM OF PARENTAL DEVOTION SHE WAS IN THE HIGH SCHOOL AND HAD NOTIONS OF LIFE WHICH WERE DECIDEDLY THOSE OF A PATRICIAN
2167-149881-0013 SHE LIKED NICE CLOTHES AND URGED FOR THEM CONSTANTLY THOUGHTS OF LOVE AND ELEGANT INDIVIDUAL ESTABLISHMENTS WERE RUNNING IN HER HEAD SHE MET GIRLS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL WHOSE PARENTS WERE TRULY RICH
2167-149881-0014 AND WHOSE FATHERS HAD STANDING LOCALLY AS PARTNERS OR OWNERS OF SOLID BUSINESSES THESE GIRLS GAVE THEMSELVES THE AIRS BEFITTING THE THRIVING DOMESTIC ESTABLISHMENTS FROM WHENCE THEY ISSUED THEY WERE THE ONLY ONES OF THE SCHOOL ABOUT WHOM JESSICA CONCERNED HERSELF
2167-149881-0015 WITH A LARGE REAL ESTATE FIRM HE CONTRIBUTED NOTHING FOR THE DOMESTIC EXPENSES OF THE FAMILY BUT WAS THOUGHT TO BE SAVING HIS MONEY TO INVEST IN REAL ESTATE HE HAD SOME ABILITY CONSIDERABLE VANITY
2167-149881-0016 AND A LOVE OF PLEASURE THAT HAD NOT AS YET INFRINGED UPON HIS DUTIES WHATEVER THEY WERE HE CAME IN AND WENT OUT PURSUING HIS OWN PLANS AND FANCIES ADDRESSING A FEW WORDS TO HIS MOTHER OCCASIONALLY RELATING SOME LITTLE INCIDENT TO HIS FATHER
2167-149881-0017 BUT FOR THE MOST PART CONFINING HIMSELF TO THOSE GENERALITIES WITH WHICH MOST CONVERSATION CONCERNS ITSELF HE WAS NOT LAYING BARE HIS DESIRES FOR ANY ONE TO SEE HE DID NOT FIND ANY ONE IN THE HOUSE WHO PARTICULARLY CARED TO SEE
2167-149881-0018 AND HAS BEEN MORE OR LESS CHAGRINED AT THE EVIDENCES OF SUPERIOR CAPABILITY IN THIS DIRECTION ELSEWHERE HER KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE EXTENDED TO THAT LITTLE CONVENTIONAL ROUND OF SOCIETY OF WHICH SHE WAS NOT BUT LONGED TO BE A MEMBER
2167-149881-0019 SHE WAS NOT WITHOUT REALISATION ALREADY THAT THIS THING WAS IMPOSSIBLE
2167-149881-0020 FOR HER DAUGHTER SHE HOPED BETTER THINGS THROUGH JESSICA SHE MIGHT RISE A LITTLE
2167-149881-0021 OF POINTING PROUDLY EVEN HURSTWOOD WAS DOING WELL ENOUGH AND SHE WAS ANXIOUS THAT HIS SMALL REAL ESTATE ADVENTURES SHOULD PROSPER HIS PROPERTY HOLDINGS AS YET WERE RATHER SMALL BUT HIS INCOME WAS PLEASING AND HIS POSITION WITH FITZGERALD AND MOY WAS FIXED
2167-149881-0022 THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH SUCH PERSONALITIES WOULD CREATE MUST BE APPARENT TO ALL IT WORKED OUT IN A THOUSAND LITTLE CONVERSATIONS ALL OF WHICH WERE OF THE SAME CALIBRE
2167-149881-0023 WHAT'S GOING ON UP THERE QUERIED MISSUS HURSTWOOD EDDIE FAHRWAY'S GOT A NEW STEAM LAUNCH AND HE WANTS ME TO COME UP AND SEE HOW IT WORKS HOW MUCH DID IT COST HIM ASKED HIS MOTHER OH OVER TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS HE SAYS IT'S A DANDY

2167-149881-0028 NO RETURNED JESSICA THEY'RE POOR AS CHURCH MICE SHE DISTINGUISHED VERY CAREFULLY BETWEEN THE YOUNG BOYS OF THE SCHOOL MANY OF WHOM WERE ATTRACTED BY HER BEAUTY
2167-149881-0029 EVENING THAT HERBERT CRANE TRIED TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH ME WHO IS HE MY DEAR INQUIRED MISSUS HURSTWOOD OH NO ONE SAID JESSICA PURSING HER PRETTY LIPS HE'S JUST A STUDENT THERE HE HASN'T ANYTHING
2167-149881-0030 THE SOAP MANUFACTURER WALKED HOME WITH HER MISSUS HURSTWOOD WAS ON THE THIRD FLOOR SITTING IN A ROCKING CHAIR READING AND HAPPENED TO LOOK OUT AT THE TIME WHO WAS THAT WITH YOU JESSICA SHE INQUIRED AS JESSICA CAME UPSTAIRS IT'S MISTER BLYFORD MAMMA
2167-149881-0031 SHE REPLIED IS IT SAID MISSUS HURSTWOOD YES AND HE WANTS ME TO STROLL OVER INTO THE PARK WITH HIM EXPLAINED JESSICA A LITTLE FLUSHED WITH RUNNING UP THE STAIRS ALL RIGHT MY DEAR SAID MISSUS HURSTWOOD DON'T BE GONE LONG
2167-149881-0032 AS THE TWO WENT DOWN THE STREET SHE GLANCED INTERESTEDLY OUT OF THE WINDOW IT WAS A MOST SATISFACTORY SPECTACLE INDEED MOST SATISFACTORY IN THIS ATMOSPHERE HURSTWOOD HAD MOVED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOT THINKING DEEPLY CONCERNING IT
2167-149881-0033 PLEASED AT TIMES BY SOME SHOW OF FINERY WHICH SUPPOSEDLY MADE FOR DIGNITY AND SOCIAL DISTINCTION THE LIFE OF THE RESORT WHICH HE MANAGED WAS HIS LIFE THERE HE SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME WHEN HE WENT HOME EVENINGS THE HOUSE LOOKED NICE
2167-149881-0034 WITH RARE EXCEPTIONS THE MEALS WERE ACCEPTABLE BEING THE KIND THAT AN ORDINARY SERVANT CAN ARRANGE IN PART HE WAS INTERESTED IN THE TALK OF HIS SON AND DAUGHTER WHO ALWAYS LOOKED WELL THE VANITY OF MISSUS HURSTWOOD CAUSED HER TO KEEP HER PERSON RATHER SHOWILY ARRAYED
2167-149881-0035 BUT TO HURSTWOOD THIS WAS MUCH BETTER THAN PLAINNESS THERE WAS NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN THEM THERE WAS NO GREAT FEELING OF DISSATISFACTION HER OPINION ON ANY SUBJECT WAS NOT STARTLING THEY DID NOT TALK ENOUGH TOGETHER TO COME TO THE ARGUMENT OF ANY ONE POINT
2167-149881-0036 IN THE ACCEPTED AND POPULAR PHRASE SHE HAD HER IDEAS AND HE HAD HIS ONCE IN A WHILE HE WOULD MEET A WOMAN WHOSE YOUTH SPRIGHTLINESS AND HUMOUR WOULD MAKE HIS WIFE SEEM RATHER DEFICIENT BY CONTRAST BUT THE TEMPORARY DISSATISFACTION
2167-149881-0037 WHICH SUCH AN ENCOUNTER MIGHT AROUSE WOULD BE COUNTERBALANCED BY HIS SOCIAL POSITION AND A CERTAIN MATTER OF POLICY HE COULD NOT COMPLICATE HIS HOME LIFE BECAUSE IT MIGHT AFFECT HIS RELATIONS WITH HIS EMPLOYERS THEY WANTED NO SCANDALS
2167-149881-0038 A MAN TO HOLD HIS POSITION MUST HAVE A DIGNIFIED MANNER A CLEAN RECORD A RESPECTABLE HOME ANCHORAGE THEREFORE HE WAS CIRCUMSPECT IN ALL HE DID AND WHENEVER HE APPEARED IN THE PUBLIC WAYS IN THE AFTERNOON OR ON SUNDAY
2167-149881-0039 IT WAS WITH HIS WIFE AND SOMETIMES HIS CHILDREN HE WOULD VISIT THE LOCAL RESORTS OR THOSE NEAR BY IN WISCONSIN AND SPEND A FEW STIFF POLISHED DAYS STROLLING ABOUT CONVENTIONAL PLACES DOING CONVENTIONAL THINGS HE KNEW THE NEED OF IT
2167-149881-0040 WHEN SOME ONE OF THE MANY MIDDLE CLASS INDIVIDUALS WHOM HE KNEW WHO HAD MONEY WOULD GET INTO TROUBLE HE WOULD SHAKE HIS HEAD IT DIDN'T DO TO TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS IF IT CAME UP FOR DISCUSSION AMONG SUCH FRIENDS AS WITH HIM PASSED FOR CLOSE
2167-149881-0041 IT WAS ALL RIGHT TO DO IT ALL MEN DO THOSE THINGS BUT WHY WASN'T HE CAREFUL A MAN CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL HE LOST SYMPATHY FOR THE MAN THAT MADE A MISTAKE AND WAS FOUND OUT ON THIS ACCOUNT HE STILL DEVOTED SOME TIME TO SHOWING HIS WIFE ABOUT
2167-149881-0042 DURING THE LAST YEAR OR TWO THE EXPENSES OF THE FAMILY SEEMED A LARGE THING JESSICA WANTED FINE CLOTHES AND MISSUS HURSTWOOD NOT TO BE OUTSHONE BY HER DAUGHTER ALSO FREQUENTLY ENLIVENED HER APPAREL HURSTWOOD HAD SAID NOTHING IN THE PAST BUT ONE DAY HE MURMURED
2167-149881-0043 JESSICA MUST HAVE A NEW DRESS THIS MONTH SAID MISSUS HURSTWOOD ONE MORNING HURSTWOOD WAS ARRAYING HIMSELF IN ONE OF HIS PERFECTION VESTS BEFORE THE GLASS AT THE TIME I THOUGHT SHE JUST BOUGHT ONE HE SAID THAT WAS JUST SOMETHING FOR EVENING WEAR RETURNED HIS WIFE COMPLACENTLY
2167-149881-0044 IT SEEMS TO ME RETURNED HURSTWOOD THAT SHE'S SPENDING A GOOD DEAL FOR DRESSES OF LATE WELL SHE'S GOING OUT MORE CONCLUDED HIS WIFE BUT THE TONE OF HIS VOICE IMPRESSED HER AS CONTAINING SOMETHING SHE HAD NOT HEARD THERE BEFORE
2167-149881-0045 HURSTWOOD HAD BEEN INVITED NOBODY KNOWS US DOWN THERE SAID ONE A GENTLEMAN WHOSE FACE WAS A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT OVER GROSS IGNORANCE AND SENSUALITY HE ALWAYS WORE A SILK HAT OF MOST IMPOSING PROPORTIONS WE CAN HAVE A GOOD TIME
2167-149881-0046 YOU WANT TO COME ALONG GEORGE THE NEXT DAY HURSTWOOD ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION TO HIS WIFE I'M GOING AWAY JULIA HE SAID FOR A FEW DAYS WHERE SHE ASKED LOOKING UP TO PHILADELPHIA ON BUSINESS
2167-149881-0047 SHE LOOKED AT HIM CONSCIOUSLY EXPECTING SOMETHING ELSE I'LL HAVE TO LEAVE YOU BEHIND THIS TIME ALL RIGHT SHE REPLIED BUT HE COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS THINKING THAT IT WAS A CURIOUS THING BEFORE HE WENT
2167-149881-0048 SHE ASKED HIM A FEW MORE QUESTIONS AND THAT IRRITATED HIM HE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT SHE WAS A DISAGREEABLE ATTACHMENT ON THIS TRIP HE ENJOYED HIMSELF THOROUGHLY AND WHEN IT WAS OVER HE WAS SORRY TO GET BACK HE WAS NOT WILLINGLY A PREVARICATOR
2167-149881-0049 SUCH AN ATMOSPHERE COULD HARDLY COME UNDER THE CATEGORY OF HOME LIFE IT RAN ALONG BY FORCE OF HABIT BY FORCE OF CONVENTIONAL OPINION
