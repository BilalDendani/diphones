4098-11547-0000 OH SHE SAID AND THOUGH THE LITTLE EXCLAMATION WAS SCARCELY MORE THAN AN INDRAWN BREATH DENIS HEARD IT AND CAME OUT OF HIS CORNER TO TAKE A SEAT AT HER SIDE AND LEAN OVER THE BOX EDGE ALSO WHAT IS IT THEODORA HE ASKED IN A LOW CLEAR VOICE
4098-11547-0001 IS IT MARGUERITE SHE LOOKED AT HIM IN A LITTLE FRIGHT AT HERSELF SHE DID NOT KNOW WHY SHE HAD EXCLAIMED SHE SCARCELY KNEW HOW BUT WHEN SHE MET HIS UNEMBARRASSED EYES SHE BEGAN TO THINK THAT POSSIBLY IT MIGHT BE MARGUERITE INDEED A SECOND LATER
4098-11547-0002 SHE WAS QUITE SURE IT HAD BEEN MARGUERITE YES I THINK SO SHE FALTERED POOR MARGUERITE IF SHE COULD ONLY HAVE SAVED HIM HOW HE ASKED I DON'T AT LEAST I SCARCELY KNOW BUT I THINK THE AUTHOR OUGHT TO HAVE MADE HER SAVE HIM SOMEWAY
4098-11547-0003 IF IF SHE COULD HAVE SUFFERED SOMETHING OR SACRIFICED SOMETHING WOULD SHE HAVE DONE IT IF SHE COULD COMMENTED DENIS LANGUIDLY HE HAD QUITE RECOVERED HIMSELF BY THIS TIME I WOULD HAVE DONE IT IF I HAD BEEN MARGUERITE THEO HALF WHISPERED
4098-11547-0004 IN HIS SURPRISE HE FORGOT HIS SELF POSSESSION HE TURNED UPON HER SUDDENLY AND MEETING HER SWEET WORLD IGNORANT EYES FELT THE FAINT PAINED SHOCK ONCE MORE AND STRANGELY ENOUGH HIS FIRST THOUGHT WAS A DISCONNECTED ONE OF PRISCILLA GOWER YOU
4098-11547-0005 HE SAID THE NEXT MOMENT YES I BELIEVE YOU WOULD THEODORA HE WAS SURE SHE WOULD AFTER THAT SWIFT GLANCE OF HIS AND WELL WHAT A HAPPY MAN HE WOULD BE FOR WHOM THIS TENDER YOUNG MARGUERITE WOULD SUFFER OR BE SACRIFICED
4098-11547-0006 THAT THEODORA NORTH WAS NEARLY A WOMAN BUT IT OCCURRED TO HIM NOW WITH ALL THE GREATER FORCE BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN SO OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT BEFORE HE SAT BY HER SIDE UNTIL THE CURTAIN FELL BUT HIS SILENT MOOD SEEMED TO HAVE COME UPON HIM AGAIN
4098-11547-0007 HE WAS VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN MARGUERITE AFTER THIS THEO THOUGHT BUT IT IS VERY MUCH TO BE DOUBTED WHETHER HE COULD HAVE GIVEN A CLEAR ACCOUNT OF WHAT WAS PASSING BEFORE HIS EYES UPON THE STAGE HE DID NOT EVEN GO INTO THE HOUSE WITH THEM WHEN THEY RETURNED
4098-11547-0008 BUT AS HE STOOD UPON THE DOOR STEP TOUCHING HIS HAT IN A FINAL ADIEU HE WAS KEENLY ALIVE TO A CONSCIOUSNESS OF THEODORA NORTH AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIR CASE WITH BILLOWS OF GLISTENING ROSE PINK SATIN LYING ON THE RICH CARPET ABOUT HER FEET AS SHE HALF TURNED TOWARD HIM
4098-11547-0009 TO BID HIM GOOD NIGHT BRIGHT AS THE FUTURE WAS IT LEFT A SENSE OF DISCOMFORT HE COULD NOT EXPLAIN WHY HE DISMISSED THE CARRIAGE AND WALKED DOWN THE STREET FEELING FAIRLY DEPRESSED IN SPIRITS HE HAD PERHAPS NEVER GIVEN THE GIRL A THOUGHT BEFORE
4098-11547-0010 UNLESS WHEN CHANCE HAD THROWN THEM TOGETHER
4098-11547-0011 HE HAD BEEN SO USED TO PRISCILLA THAT IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT A GIRL SO YOUNG AS THIS ONE COULD BE A WOMAN AND AFTER ALL HIS BLINDNESS HAD NOT BEEN THE RESULT OF ANY FRIVOLOUS LACK OF THOUGHT A SHARP EXPERIENCE HAD MADE HIM AS THOROUGHLY A MAN OF THE WORLD AS A MAN MAY BE
4098-11547-0012 BUT IT HAD NOT MADE HIM CALLOUS OR INDIFFERENT TO THE BEAUTIES OF LIFE NO ONE WOULD EVER HAVE CALLED HIM EMOTIONAL OR PRONE TO ENTHUSIASMS OF A WEAK KIND AND YET HE WAS BY NO MEANS HARD OF HEART HE HAD QUIET FANCIES OF HIS OWN ABOUT PEOPLE AND THINGS
4098-11547-0013 AND MANY OF THESE RETICENT RARELY EXPRESSED IDEAS WERE REVERENT CHIVALROUS ONES OF WOMEN THE OPPOSING FORCE OF A WHOLE WORLD COULD NEVER HAVE SHAKEN HIS FAITH IN PRISCILLA GOWER OR TOUCHED HIS RESPECT FOR HER BUT THOUGH PERHAPS HE HAD NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT SO
4098-11547-0014 HE HAD NEVER FELT VERY ENTHUSIASTICALLY CONCERNING HER TRULY PRISCILLA GOWER AND ENTHUSIASM WERE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH EACH OTHER CHANCE HAD THROWN THEM TOGETHER WHEN BOTH WERE VERY YOUNG AND PROPINQUITY DID THE REST PROPINQUITY IS THE STRONGEST OF AGENTS IN A LOVE AFFAIR
4098-11547-0015 AND IN DENIS OGLETHORPE'S LOVE AFFAIR PROPINQUITY HAD ACCOMPLISHED WHAT NOTHING ELSE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKELY TO HAVE DONE THE DESPERATE YOUNG SCRIBBLER OF TWENTY YEARS HAD BEEN THE LODGER OF THE ELDER MISS GOWER AND PRISCILLA AGED SEVENTEEN HAD BROUGHT IN HIS FRUGAL DINNERS TO HIM
4098-11547-0016 AND RECEIPTED HIS MODEST BILLS ON THEIR WEEKLY PAYMENT PRISCILLA AT SEVENTEEN SILENT PRACTICAL GRAVE AND HANDSOME HAD PERHAPS SOFTENED UNCONSCIOUSLY AT THE SIGHT OF HIS OFTEN PALE FACE HE WORKED SO HARD AND SO FAR INTO THE NIGHT
4098-11547-0017 WHEN AT LENGTH THEY BECAME FRIENDS PRISCILLA GRAVELY AND WITHOUT ANY HESITATION VOLUNTEERED TO HELP HIM SHE COULD COPY WELL AND CLEARLY AND HE COULD COME INTO HER AUNT'S ROOM IT WOULD SAVE FIRES SO SHE HELPED HIM CALMLY AND DECOROUSLY
4098-11547-0018 BENDING HER ALMOST AUSTERELY HANDSOME YOUNG HEAD OVER HIS PAPERS FOR HOURS ON THE LONG WINTER NIGHTS IT IS EASY TO GUESS HOW THE MATTER TERMINATED IF EVER HE WON SUCCESS HE DETERMINED TO GIVE IT TO PRISCILLA AND SO HE TOLD HER
4098-11547-0019 HE HAD NEVER WAVERED IN HIS FAITH FOR A SECOND SINCE THOUGH HE HAD ENCOUNTERED MANY BEAUTIFUL AND WOMANLY WOMEN HE HAD WORKED STEADILY FOR HER SAKE AND SHIELDED HER FROM EVERY CARE THAT IT LAY WITHIN HIS POWER TO LIGHTEN
4098-11547-0020 HE WAS NOT OLD MISS ELIZABETH GOWER'S LODGER NOW HE WAS HER NIECE'S HUSBAND IN PERSPECTIVE HE WAS TO MARRY PRISCILLA GOWER IN EIGHT MONTHS THIS WAS WHY THEODORA NORTH IN GLISTENING ROSE PINK SATIN
4098-11547-0021 SENT HIM HOME CONFRONTING A SUDDENLY RAISED SPIRIT OF PAIN TWICE IN ONE NIGHT HE HAD FOUND HIMSELF FEELING TOWARD THEODORA NORTH AS HE HAD NEVER FELT TOWARD PRISCILLA GOWER IN HIS LIFE TWICE IN ONE NIGHT HE HAD TURNED HIS EYES UPON THIS GIRL OF SIXTEEN
4098-11547-0022 AND SUFFERED A SUDDEN SHOCK OF ENTHUSIASM OR SOMETHING LIKE IT HE WAS STARTLED AND DISCOMFITED SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO WIN SUCH ADMIRATION FROM HIM HE HAD NO RIGHT TO GIVE IT BUT AS HIS WALK IN THE NIGHT AIR COOLED HIM
4098-11547-0023 IT COOLED HIS ARDOR OF SELF EXAMINATION SOMEWHAT HIS DISCONTENT WAS MODIFIED BY THE TIME HE REACHED HIS OWN DOOR AND TOOK HIS LATCH KEY OUT OF HIS POCKET THE FACE THAT HAD LOOKED DOWN UPON HIM BENEATH THE LIGHT AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIR CASE
4098-11547-0024 HAD FADED INTO LESS STRIKING COLOR IT WAS ONLY A GIRL'S FACE AGAIN HE WAS ON BETTER TERMS WITH HIMSELF AND HIS WEAKNESS SEEMED LESS FORMIDABLE I WILL KEEP MY PROMISE TO MORROW HE SAID AND PRISCILLA SHALL GO WITH US POOR PRISCILLA POOR GIRL
4098-11547-0025 THE PROMISE HE HAD MADE WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A RATIFICATION OF THE OLD ONE THEY WERE TO SEE THE LIONS TOGETHER AND PRISCILLA WAS TO GUIDE THEM AND WHEN THE MORROW CAME HE FOUND IT AFTER ALL SAFE ENOUGH AND AN EASY ENOUGH MATTER
4098-11547-0026 TO TUCK THEODORA'S SMALL GLOVED HAND UNDER HIS ARM WHEN THEY SET OUT ON THEIR TOUR OF INVESTIGATION AND DISCOVERY THE GIRL WAS PRETTY ENOUGH TOO IN HER SOFT BLACK MERINO HER BEST DRESS IN DOWNPORT BUT SHE WAS NOT DAZZLING
4098-11547-0027 THE LITTLE ROUND BLACK PLUMED HAT WAS BECOMING ALSO BUT IN HIS NOW MORE PROSAIC MOOD HE COULD STAND THAT TOO PRETTY AS IT WAS IN AN INNOCENT UNCONSCIOUSLY COQUETTISH WAY THEO WAS NEVER COQUETTISH HERSELF IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE
4098-11547-0028 SHE WAS NOT WORLD WISE ENOUGH FOR THAT YET BUT SHE WAS QUITE EXHILARATING TO DAY SO GLAD TO BE OUT EVEN IN THE LONDON FOG OF NOVEMBER SO GLAD TO BE TAKEN LION HUNTING SO DELIGHTED WITH THE SHOPS AND THEIR GAY WINDOWS SO READY TO LET HER YOUNG TONGUE
4098-11547-0029 RUN ON IN A GAY STREAM OF CHATTER ALTOGETHER SO BRIGHT AND PRETTY AND JOYOUS THAT HER ESCORT WAS FAIN TO BE DELIGHTED TOO GUESS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO FIRST
4098-11547-0030 SHE GLANCED UP INTO HIS FACE BRIGHTLY SHE REMEMBERED WHAT HE HAD TOLD HER ABOUT HIS LADY FRIEND
4098-11547-0031 BUT I THINK I KNOW THE NAME OF THE PERSON WE ARE GOING TO SEE DO YOU WAS HIS REPLY THEN SAY IT TO ME LET ME HEAR IT MISS GOWER SHE ANSWERED SOFTLY IN A PRETTY REVERENCE FOR HIM MISS PRISCILLA GOWER HE NODDED SLIGHTLY
4098-11547-0032 WITH A CURIOUS MIXTURE OF EXPRESSIONS IN HIS FACE YES HE SAID MISS GOWER OR RATHER MISS PRISCILLA GOWER AS YOU SAY NUMBER TWENTY THREE BROOME STREET AND BROOME STREET IS NOT A FASHIONABLE LOCALITY MY DEAR THEODORA ISN'T IT
4098-11547-0033 QUERIED THEO WHY NOT HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS ASK LADY THROCKMORTON HE SAID BUT DO YOU KNOW WHO MISS PRISCILLA GOWER IS THEODORA HER BRIGHT EYES CREPT UP TO HIS HALF TIMIDLY BUT SHE SAID NOTHING SO HE CONTINUED
4098-11547-0034 MISS PRISCILLA GOWER IS THE YOUNG LADY TO WHOM I AM TO BE MARRIED NEXT JULY DID YOU KNOW THAT YES ANSWERED THEO LOOKING ACTUALLY PLEASED AND BLUSHING BEAUTIFULLY AS HE LOOKED DOWN AT HER BUT I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR TELLING ME MISTER OGLETHORPE
4098-11547-0035 WHY HE ASKED IT WAS VERY PREPOSTEROUS THAT EVEN THOUGH HIS MOOD WAS SO PROSAIC AND PATERNAL A ONE HE WAS ABSURDLY VACANTLY SENSIBLE OF FEELING SOME UNEASINESS AT THE BRIGHTNESS OF HER UPTURNED FACE FOR PITY'S SAKE
4098-11547-0036 WHY WAS IT THAT HE WAS IMPELLED TO SUCH A PUERILE WEAKNESS SUCH A VANITY AS HE STERNLY CALLED IT BECAUSE RETURNED THEO IT MAKES ME FEEL AS IF I MEAN
4098-11547-0037 I HOPE OH I DO HOPE MISS PRISCILLA GOWER WILL LIKE ME HE HAD BEEN LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM WHILE SHE SPOKE BUT THIS BROUGHT HIS EYES TO HERS AGAIN AND TO HER FACE BRIGHT APPEALING UPTURNED
4098-11547-0038 MISS ELIZABETH GOWER HERSELF WAS THERE IN HER COMPANY CAP AND LONG CHERISHED COMPANY DRESS OF SNUFF COLORED SATIN THERE WERE NOT MANY SHADES OF DIFFERENCE IN EITHER HER SNUFF COLORED GOWN OR HER SNUFF COLORED SKIN OR HER NEAT SNUFF COLORED FALSE FRONT
4098-11547-0039 THEO FANCIED BUT SHE WAS NOT AT ALL AFRAID OF HER SHE WAS A TRIFLE AFRAID OF MISS PRISCILLA MISS PRISCILLA WAS SITTING AT THE TABLE READING WHEN THEY ENTERED AND AS SHE ROSE TO GREET THEM HOLDING HER BOOK IN ONE HAND
4098-11547-0040 THE THOUGHT ENTERED THEO'S MIND THAT SHE COULD COMPREHEND DIMLY WHY LADY THROCKMORTON DISLIKED HER AND THOUGHT HER UNSUITED TO DENIS OGLETHORPE THERE WAS AN ABSENCE OF ANYTHING GIRL LIKE IN HER FINE IVORY PALE FACE SOMEHOW
4098-11547-0041 AT WHOSE FINE LINES AND CLEAR CONTOUR EVEN A CONNOISSEUR COULD NOT HAVE CAVILED
4098-11547-0042 BLACK FRINGED AND LUSTROUS AS THEY WERE STILL WERE SILENT EYES THEY DID NOT SPEAK EVEN TO DENIS OGLETHORPE
4098-11547-0043 SHE SAID SIMPLY EXTENDING HER HAND IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF DENIS'S INTRODUCTION THE QUIETNESS OF THIS GREETING SPEECH WAS A FAIR SAMPLE OF ALL HER MANNER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SHEERLY IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPECT ANYTHING LIKE EFFUSIVENESS FROM PRISCILLA GOWER
4098-11547-0044 THE MOST SANGUINE AND EMPTY HEADED OF MORTALS WOULD NEVER HAVE LOOKED FOR IT IN HER SHE WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY UNENTHUSIASTIC IF SUCH A THING MAY BE
4098-11547-0045 THE FACT THAT DENIS HAD SPOKEN OF HER ADMIRINGLY WAS SUFFICIENT TO AROUSE IN HER MIND AN INTEREST IN THIS YOUNG CREATURE WHO WAS AT ONCE AND SO INCONSISTENTLY BEAUTIFUL TIMID AND REGAL WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS
4098-11547-0046 THREE YEARS MORE WILL MAKE HER SOMETHING WONDERFUL AS FAR AS BEAUTY IS CONCERNED HE HAD SAID AND ACCORDINGLY SHE HAD FELT SOME SLIGHT PLEASURE IN THE ANTICIPATION OF SEEING HER YET THEO HAD SOME FAINT MISGIVINGS DURING THE DAY
4098-11547-0047 AS TO WHETHER MISS PRISCILLA GOWER WOULD LIKE HER OR NOT SHE WAS AT FIRST EVEN INCLINED TO FEAR THAT SHE WOULD NOT BEING SO VERY HANDSOME AND GRAVE AND WOMANLY BUT TOWARD THE END OF THEIR JOURNEYING TOGETHER SHE FELT MORE HOPEFUL RETICENT AS SHE WAS
4098-11547-0048 PRISCILLA GOWER WAS A VERY CHARMING YOUNG PERSON SHE TALKED WELL AND WITH MUCH CLEAR CALM SENSE SHE LAUGHED MUSICALLY WHEN SHE LAUGHED AT ALL AND COULD MAKE VERY TELLING CAUSTIC SPEECHES WHEN OCCASION REQUIRED
4098-11547-0049 BUT STILL IT WAS SINGULAR WHAT A WIDE DIFFERENCE THE DIFFERENCE OF SIX YEARS MADE IN THE TWO GIRLS AS LADY THROCKMORTON HAD SAID IT WAS NOT A MATTER OF AGE AT TWENTY TWO THEODORA NORTH WOULD OVERFLOW WITH YOUTH AS JOYOUSLY AS SHE DID NOW AT SEVENTEEN
4098-11547-0050 AT SEVENTEEN PRISCILLA GOWER HAD ASSISTED HER MAIDEN AUNT'S LODGER TO COPY HIS MANUSCRIPT WITH AS MATURE A GRAVITY AS SHE WOULD HAVE DISPLAYED TO DAY I HOPE SAID THEODORA WHEN AFTER THEIR SIGHT SEEING WAS OVER
4098-11547-0051 SHE STOOD ON THE PAVEMENT BEFORE THE DOOR IN BROOME STREET HER NICE LITTLE HAND ON DENIS OGLETHORPE'S ARM I HOPE YOU WILL LET ME COME TO SEE YOU AGAIN MISS GOWER PRISCILLA STANDING UPON THE DOOR STEP SMILED DOWN ON HER BLOOMING GIRL'S FACE A SMILE THAT WAS A LITTLE LIKE MOONLIGHT
4098-11547-0052 ALL PRISCILLA'S SMILES WERE LIKE MOONLIGHT THEO'S HAD A DELICIOUS GLOW OF THE SUN YES SHE SAID IN HER PRACTICAL MANNER IT WILL PLEASE ME VERY MUCH TO SEE YOU MISS THEODORA COME AS OFTEN AS YOU CAN SPARE THE TIME
