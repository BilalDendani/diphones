4193-48170-0000 DO YOU KNOW I AM CONVINCED THAT WHAT YOU TOLD ME ABOUT PAUL STREET AND THE HERBERTS IS A MERE EPISODE IN AN EXTRAORDINARY HISTORY I MAY AS WELL CONFESS TO YOU THAT WHEN I ASKED YOU ABOUT HERBERT A FEW MONTHS AGO I HAD JUST SEEN HIM YOU HAD SEEN HIM WHERE
4193-48170-0001 HE BEGGED OF ME IN THE STREET ONE NIGHT HE WAS IN THE MOST PITIABLE PLIGHT BUT I RECOGNIZED THE MAN AND I GOT HIM TO TELL ME HIS HISTORY OR AT LEAST THE OUTLINE OF IT IN BRIEF IT AMOUNTED TO THIS HE HAD BEEN RUINED BY HIS WIFE
4193-48170-0002 AND I MEAN TO FIND HER SOONER OR LATER I KNOW A MAN NAMED CLARKE A DRY FELLOW IN FACT A MAN OF BUSINESS BUT SHREWD ENOUGH YOU UNDERSTAND MY MEANING NOT SHREWD IN THE MERE BUSINESS SENSE OF THE WORD BUT A MAN WHO REALLY KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT MEN AND LIFE WELL
4193-48170-0003 I LAID THE CASE BEFORE HIM AND HE WAS EVIDENTLY IMPRESSED HE SAID IT NEEDED CONSIDERATION AND ASKED ME TO COME AGAIN IN THE COURSE OF A WEEK A FEW DAYS LATER I RECEIVED THIS EXTRAORDINARY LETTER AUSTIN TOOK THE ENVELOPE DREW OUT THE LETTER AND READ IT CURIOUSLY
4193-48170-0004 IT RAN AS FOLLOWS MY DEAR VILLIERS I HAVE THOUGHT OVER THE MATTER ON WHICH YOU CONSULTED ME THE OTHER NIGHT
4193-48170-0005 THROW THE PORTRAIT INTO THE FIRE BLOT OUT THE STORY FROM YOUR MIND
4193-48170-0006 YOU WILL THINK NO DOUBT THAT I AM IN POSSESSION OF SOME SECRET INFORMATION AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THAT IS THE CASE BUT I ONLY KNOW A LITTLE I AM LIKE A TRAVELLER WHO HAS PEERED OVER AN ABYSS AND HAS DRAWN BACK IN TERROR WHAT I KNOW IS STRANGE ENOUGH AND HORRIBLE ENOUGH
4193-48170-0007 BUT BEYOND MY KNOWLEDGE THERE ARE DEPTHS AND HORRORS MORE FRIGHTFUL STILL MORE INCREDIBLE THAN ANY TALE TOLD OF WINTER NIGHTS ABOUT THE FIRE I HAVE RESOLVED AND NOTHING SHALL SHAKE THAT RESOLVE TO EXPLORE NO WHIT FARTHER
4193-48170-0008 AND IF YOU VALUE YOUR HAPPINESS YOU WILL MAKE THE SAME DETERMINATION COME AND SEE ME BY ALL MEANS BUT WE WILL TALK ON MORE CHEERFUL TOPICS THAN THIS AUSTIN FOLDED THE LETTER METHODICALLY AND RETURNED IT TO VILLIERS
4193-48170-0009 VILLIERS TOLD HIS STORY AS HE HAD TOLD IT TO CLARKE AND AUSTIN LISTENED IN SILENCE HE SEEMED PUZZLED HOW VERY CURIOUS THAT YOU SHOULD EXPERIENCE SUCH AN UNPLEASANT SENSATION IN THAT ROOM HE SAID AT LENGTH
4193-48170-0010 I HARDLY GATHER THAT IT WAS A MERE MATTER OF THE IMAGINATION A FEELING OF REPULSION IN SHORT NO IT WAS MORE PHYSICAL THAN MENTAL IT WAS AS IF I WERE INHALING AT EVERY BREATH SOME DEADLY FUME WHICH SEEMED TO PENETRATE TO EVERY NERVE AND BONE AND SINEW OF MY BODY
4193-48170-0011 I FELT RACKED FROM HEAD TO FOOT MY EYES BEGAN TO GROW DIM IT WAS LIKE THE ENTRANCE OF DEATH YES YES VERY STRANGE CERTAINLY YOU SEE YOUR FRIEND CONFESSES THAT THERE IS SOME VERY BLACK STORY CONNECTED WITH THIS WOMAN
4193-48170-0012 DID YOU NOTICE ANY PARTICULAR EMOTION IN HIM WHEN YOU WERE TELLING YOUR TALE YES I DID HE BECAME VERY FAINT BUT HE ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS A MERE PASSING ATTACK TO WHICH HE WAS SUBJECT DID YOU BELIEVE HIM I DID AT THE TIME BUT I DON'T NOW
4193-48170-0013 HE HEARD WHAT I HAD TO SAY WITH A GOOD DEAL OF INDIFFERENCE TILL I SHOWED HIM THE PORTRAIT IT WAS THEN THAT HE WAS SEIZED WITH THE ATTACK OF WHICH I SPOKE HE LOOKED GHASTLY I ASSURE YOU THEN HE MUST HAVE SEEN THE WOMAN BEFORE BUT THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER EXPLANATION
4193-48170-0014 WHAT DO YOU THINK I COULDN'T SAY TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF IT WAS AFTER TURNING THE PORTRAIT IN HIS HANDS THAT HE NEARLY DROPPED FROM THE CHAIR THE NAME YOU KNOW WAS WRITTEN ON THE BACK QUITE SO AFTER ALL IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO COME TO ANY RESOLUTION IN A CASE LIKE THIS
4193-48170-0015 I HATE MELODRAMA AND NOTHING STRIKES ME AS MORE COMMONPLACE AND TEDIOUS THAN THE ORDINARY GHOST STORY OF COMMERCE BUT REALLY VILLIERS IT LOOKS AS IF THERE WERE SOMETHING VERY QUEER AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL THIS THE TWO MEN HAD WITHOUT NOTICING IT TURNED UP ASHLEY STREET
4193-48170-0016 LEADING NORTHWARD FROM PICCADILLY IT WAS A LONG STREET AND RATHER A GLOOMY ONE BUT HERE AND THERE A BRIGHTER TASTE HAD ILLUMINATED THE DARK HOUSES WITH FLOWERS AND GAY CURTAINS AND A CHEERFUL PAINT ON THE DOORS
4193-48170-0017 AND LOOKED AT ONE OF THESE HOUSES GERANIUMS RED AND WHITE DROOPED FROM EVERY SILL AND DAFFODIL COLOURED CURTAINS WERE DRAPED BACK FROM EACH WINDOW IT LOOKS CHEERFUL DOESN'T IT HE SAID YES AND THE INSIDE IS STILL MORE CHEERY
4193-48170-0018 ONE OF THE PLEASANTEST HOUSES OF THE SEASON SO I HAVE HEARD I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE MYSELF BUT I'VE MET SEVERAL MEN WHO HAVE AND THEY TELL ME IT'S UNCOMMONLY JOVIAL WHOSE HOUSE IS IT A MISSUS BEAUMONT'S AND WHO IS SHE I COULDN'T TELL YOU
4193-48170-0019 I HAVE HEARD SHE COMES FROM SOUTH AMERICA BUT AFTER ALL WHO SHE IS IS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE SHE IS A VERY WEALTHY WOMAN THERE'S NO DOUBT OF THAT
4193-48170-0020 I HEAR SHE HAS SOME WONDERFUL CLARET REALLY MARVELLOUS WINE WHICH MUST HAVE COST A FABULOUS SUM LORD ARGENTINE WAS TELLING ME ABOUT IT HE WAS THERE LAST SUNDAY EVENING HE ASSURES ME HE HAS NEVER TASTED SUCH A WINE AND ARGENTINE AS YOU KNOW IS AN EXPERT BY THE WAY THAT REMINDS ME
4193-48170-0021 ARGENTINE ASKED HER HOW OLD THE WINE WAS
4193-48170-0022 ABOUT A THOUSAND YEARS I BELIEVE LORD ARGENTINE THOUGHT SHE WAS CHAFFING HIM YOU KNOW BUT WHEN HE LAUGHED SHE SAID SHE WAS SPEAKING QUITE SERIOUSLY AND OFFERED TO SHOW HIM THE JAR OF COURSE HE COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE AFTER THAT BUT IT SEEMS RATHER ANTIQUATED FOR A BEVERAGE DOESN'T IT
4193-48170-0023 WHY HERE WE ARE AT MY ROOMS COME IN WON'T YOU THANKS I THINK I WILL I HAVEN'T SEEN THE CURIOSITY SHOP FOR A WHILE IT WAS A ROOM FURNISHED RICHLY YET ODDLY WHERE EVERY JAR AND BOOKCASE AND TABLE
4193-48170-0024 AND EVERY RUG AND JAR AND ORNAMENT SEEMED TO BE A THING APART PRESERVING EACH ITS OWN INDIVIDUALITY ANYTHING FRESH LATELY SAID VILLIERS AFTER A WHILE NO I THINK NOT YOU SAW THOSE QUEER JUGS DIDN'T YOU I THOUGHT SO
4193-48170-0025 AUSTIN GLANCED AROUND THE ROOM FROM CUPBOARD TO CUPBOARD FROM SHELF TO SHELF IN SEARCH OF SOME NEW ODDITY HIS EYES FELL AT LAST ON AN ODD CHEST PLEASANTLY AND QUAINTLY CARVED WHICH STOOD IN A DARK CORNER OF THE ROOM AH
4193-48170-0026 HE SAID I WAS FORGETTING I HAVE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU AUSTIN UNLOCKED THE CHEST DREW OUT A THICK QUARTO VOLUME LAID IT ON THE TABLE AND RESUMED THE CIGAR HE HAD PUT DOWN DID YOU KNOW ARTHUR MEYRICK THE PAINTER VILLIERS
4193-48170-0027 A LITTLE I MET HIM TWO OR THREE TIMES AT THE HOUSE OF A FRIEND OF MINE WHAT HAS BECOME OF HIM I HAVEN'T HEARD HIS NAME MENTIONED FOR SOME TIME HE'S DEAD YOU DON'T SAY SO QUITE YOUNG WASN'T HE YES
4193-48170-0028 WHAT DID HE DIE OF I DON'T KNOW HE WAS AN INTIMATE FRIEND OF MINE AND A THOROUGHLY GOOD FELLOW HE USED TO COME HERE AND TALK TO ME FOR HOURS AND HE WAS ONE OF THE BEST TALKERS I HAVE MET
4193-48170-0029 ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO HE WAS FEELING RATHER OVERWORKED AND PARTLY AT MY SUGGESTION HE WENT OFF ON A SORT OF ROVING EXPEDITION WITH NO VERY DEFINITE END OR AIM ABOUT IT I BELIEVE NEW YORK WAS TO BE HIS FIRST PORT BUT I NEVER HEARD FROM HIM
4193-48170-0030 STATING THAT HE HAD ATTENDED THE LATE MISTER MEYRICK DURING HIS ILLNESS AND THAT THE DECEASED HAD EXPRESSED AN EARNEST WISH THAT THE ENCLOSED PACKET SHOULD BE SENT TO ME AFTER HIS DEATH THAT WAS ALL AND HAVEN'T YOU WRITTEN FOR FURTHER PARTICULARS
4193-48170-0031 I HAVE BEEN THINKING OF DOING SO YOU WOULD ADVISE ME TO WRITE TO THE DOCTOR CERTAINLY AND WHAT ABOUT THE BOOK IT WAS SEALED UP WHEN I GOT IT
4193-48170-0032 IT IS SOMETHING VERY RARE MEYRICK WAS A COLLECTOR PERHAPS NO I THINK NOT HARDLY A COLLECTOR
4193-48170-0033 THEY ARE PECULIAR BUT I LIKE THEM BUT AREN'T YOU GOING TO SHOW ME POOR MEYRICK'S LEGACY YES YES TO BE SURE THE FACT IS IT'S RATHER A PECULIAR SORT OF THING AND I HAVEN'T SHOWN IT TO ANY ONE
4193-48170-0034 I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT IF I WERE YOU THERE IT IS
4193-48170-0035 IT ISN'T A PRINTED VOLUME THEN HE SAID NO IT IS A COLLECTION OF DRAWINGS IN BLACK AND WHITE BY MY POOR FRIEND MEYRICK VILLIERS TURNED TO THE FIRST PAGE
4193-48170-0036 ON THE THIRD PAGE WAS A DESIGN WHICH MADE VILLIERS START AND LOOK UP AT AUSTIN HE WAS GAZING ABSTRACTEDLY OUT OF THE WINDOW
4193-48170-0037 ABSORBED IN SPITE OF HIMSELF IN THE FRIGHTFUL WALPURGIS NIGHT OF EVIL STRANGE MONSTROUS EVIL THAT THE DEAD ARTIST HAD SET FORTH IN HARD BLACK AND WHITE THE FIGURES OF FAUNS AND SATYRS AND AEGIPANS DANCED BEFORE HIS EYES THE DARKNESS OF THE THICKET
4193-48170-0038 THE DANCE ON THE MOUNTAIN TOP THE SCENES BY LONELY SHORES IN GREEN VINEYARDS BY ROCKS AND DESERT PLACES PASSED BEFORE HIM A WORLD BEFORE WHICH THE HUMAN SOUL SEEMED TO SHRINK BACK AND SHUDDER
4193-48170-0039 HE HAD SEEN ENOUGH BUT THE PICTURE ON THE LAST LEAF CAUGHT HIS EYE AS HE ALMOST CLOSED THE BOOK AUSTIN WELL WHAT IS IT DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS IT WAS A WOMAN'S FACE ALONE ON THE WHITE PAGE
4193-48170-0040 I DO WHO IS IT IT IS MISSUS HERBERT ARE YOU SURE I AM PERFECTLY SURE OF IT POOR MEYRICK HE IS ONE MORE CHAPTER IN HER HISTORY
4193-48170-0041 THEY ARE FRIGHTFUL LOCK THE BOOK UP AGAIN AUSTIN IF I WERE YOU I WOULD BURN IT IT MUST BE A TERRIBLE COMPANION EVEN THOUGH IT BE IN A CHEST YES THEY ARE SINGULAR DRAWINGS BUT I WONDER WHAT CONNECTION THERE COULD BE BETWEEN MEYRICK AND MISSUS HERBERT
4193-48170-0042 OR WHAT LINK BETWEEN HER AND THESE DESIGNS AH WHO CAN SAY
4193-48170-0043 BUT IN MY OWN OPINION THIS HELEN VAUGHAN OR MISSUS HERBERT IS ONLY THE BEGINNING SHE WILL COME BACK TO LONDON AUSTIN DEPEND ON IT SHE WILL COME BACK AND WE SHALL HEAR MORE ABOUT HER THEN
