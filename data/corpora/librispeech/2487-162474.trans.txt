2487-162474-0000 IN THE EARLY MORNING OF MIDSUMMER EVE HAZEL WANDERED UP THE HILL SLOPES THERE THE SHEEP GOLDEN AND GOSPEL LIKE IN THE EARLY LIGHT FED ON WET LAWNS PALE AND UNSUBSTANTIAL AS GAUZE
2487-162474-0001 SHE DID NOT AS THE MORE SELF CONSCIOUS CREATURES OF CIVILIZATION WOULD HAVE DONE ENVY THEIR PEACE IN SO MANY WORDS
2487-162474-0002 WHEN SHE WENT IN TO BREAKFAST SHE THOUGHT THE SAME OF MISSUS MARSTON AFTERWARDS THEY PICKED BLACK CURRANTS MISSUS MARSTON SEATED ON A CAMP STOOL AND WEARING HER LARGE MUSHROOM HAT
2487-162474-0003 WHICH ALWAYS TILTED SLIGHTLY AND MADE HER LOOK RAKISH WHENEVER A BLACKBIRD DASHED OUT OF THE GROVE OF HALF RIPE RED CURRANTS SCOLDING WITH DEMONIAC VITALITY SHE WOULD LOOK UP AND SAY NAUGHTY BIRD SHE PICKED WITH DELIBERATION
2487-162474-0004 AND PLACED THE CURRANTS IN THE BASKET WITH AN AIR OF BENEDICTION THE DAY WAS HOT AND SPLENDID A DAY TO MAKE THE LEAVES LIMP AND CRACK THE FLOWER BEDS
2487-162474-0005 AND A BREEZE LADEN WITH WILD THYME AND MOSS FRAGRANCE PLAYED ABOUT THE GARDEN LIKE AN INVISIBLE CHILD AT ELEVEN MARTHA APPEARED WITH CAKE AND MILK AND EDWARD RETURNED FROM OLD SOLOMON'S BEDSIDE
2487-162474-0006 THEN THEY WENT ON PICKING WHILE EDWARD READ THEM SNATCHES OF NATURAL LAW HAZEL WAS SOOTHED BY THE READING TO THE SENSE OF WHICH SHE PAID NO HEED IT MINGLED WITH THE DRONE OF THE HOT BEES FALLING IN AND OUT OF THE BIG RED PEONIES
2487-162474-0007 THE FAR OFF SOUND OF GRASS CUTTING THE GRAVE MEASURED SOLILOQUY OF A BLACKBIRD HIDDEN IN THE FLAME FLOWERED CHESTNUT HAZEL FELT THAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO GO ON PICKING CURRANTS FOR EVER
2487-162474-0008 GROWING MORE AND MORE LIKE MISSUS MARSTON EVERY DAY AND AT LEAST BECOMING POSSIBLY THROUGH SHEER BENIGNITY A GRANDMOTHER THERE SEEMED NO PLACE IN HER LIFE FOR REDDIN NO TIME FOR HUNTER'S SPINNEY SHE THOUGHT I WUNNA GO
2487-162474-0009 BUT A PEREMPTORY VOICE SAID THAT SHE MUST GO AND ONCE MORE HER SOUL BECAME THE PASSIVE BATTLEGROUND OF STRANGE EMOTIONS
2487-162474-0010 WHILE THEY FOUGHT THERE LIKE CREATURES IN THE DARK HAZEL SITTING IN THE AROMATIC SHADOW OF THE CURRANTS FELL FAST ASLEEP AND AS MISSUS MARSTON COULD NEVER BRING HERSELF TO WAKE ANYONE SHE SLEPT UNTIL MARTHA RANG THE DINNER BELL
2487-162474-0011 SO THE PEACEFUL GOLDEN DAY WORE ON TO GREEN EVENING IT WAS A DAY THAT HAZEL ALWAYS REMEMBERED WHEN THE SHADOWS GREW LONG AND DEW FELL
2487-162474-0012 AND THE DAISIES ON THE GRAVES FILLED THE HOUSE WITH THEIR FAINT INNOCENT FRAGRANCE AND CLOSED THEIR PINK LINED PETALS FOR THE NIGHT HAZEL FELT VERY MISERABLE THIS VERY NIGHT SHE WAS GOING TO WORK THE LAST CHARM
2487-162474-0013 THE CHARM OF THE BRACKEN FLOWER AND WHOSO SHE DREAMED OF WITH THAT FLOWER BENEATH HER PILLOW MUST BE HER LOVER SHE FELT TRAITOROUS TO EDWARD IN DOING THIS SHE AND EDWARD WERE HANDFASTED
2487-162474-0014 HOW THEN COULD SHE HAVE ANY LOVER BUT EDWARD WHY SHOULD SHE WORK THE CHARM SHE PUZZLED OVER THIS DURING PRAYERS BUT NO ANSWER CAME TO HER QUESTIONING LIFE IS A TACITURN MOTHER
2487-162474-0015 AND TEACHES NOT SO MUCH BY INSTRUCTION AS BY BLOWS EDWARD WAS READING THE TWENTY THIRD PSALM WHICH ALWAYS AFFECTED HIS MOTHER TO TEARS AND IN READING WHICH HIS VOICE WAS VERY TENDER
2487-162474-0016 AND LEAD THEE FORTH BESIDE THE WATERS OF COMFORT THE ROOM WAS FULL OF A DEEP EXALTATION A PASSION OF TRUSTFULNESS I WENT ALONG BY THE WATER HAZEL THOUGHT
2487-162474-0017 AND I THOUGHT IT WAS THE WATERS OF COMFORT
2487-162474-0018 SHE DID NOT FEEL AS SURE AS THE OTHERS DID OF THE WATERS OF COMFORT SO BEAUTIFUL DEAR MURMURED MISSUS MARSTON SO LIKE YOUR POOR DEAR FATHER
2487-162474-0019 EDWARD'S GOOD NIGHT TO HAZEL WAS MORE CURT THAN USUAL SHE WAS LOOKING SO MYSTERIOUSLY LOVELY HER STRESS OF MIND HAD GIVEN A TOUCH OF SPIRITUALITY TO HER FACE
2487-162474-0020 AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT STIRS PASSION AS SPIRITUALITY DOES SHE HAD ON A PRINT FROCK OF A NEAT DESIGN REMINISCENT OF OLD FASHIONED CHINA AND SHE HAD PINNED A POSY OF DAISIES ON HER SHOULDER
2487-162474-0021 FOR ONE SECOND AS SHE HELD UP HER CHEEK TO BE KISSED STANDING ON THE THRESHOLD OF HER MOONLIT ROOM EDWARD HESITATED THEN HE ABRUPTLY TURNED AND SHUT HIS DOOR
2487-162474-0022 HIS HOUR HAD PASSED HAZEL STOOD IN THE WINDOW READING THE CHARM ON MIDSUMMER EVE WHEN IT WANTS A LITTLE OF MIDNIGHT SPREAD YOUR SMOCK WHERE THE BRACKEN GROWS
2487-162474-0023 FOR THIS IS THE NIGHT OF THE FLOWERING OF THE BRAKE THAT BEARETH A BLUE FLOWER ON THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT
2487-162474-0024 COME YOU AGAIN ABOUT THE TIME OF THE FIRST BIRD CALL IF AUGHT IS IN THE SMOCK TAKE IT IT IS THE DUST OF THE FLOWER SLEEP ABOVE IT AND HE YOU DREAM OF IS YOUR LOVER
2487-162474-0025 THIS IS A SURE CHARM AND CANNOT BE BROKE SHE TOOK A CLEAN CHEMISE FROM THE DRAWER AND WHEN THE LANDING CLOCK STRUCK THE HALF HOUR SHE SLIPPED OUT ON TO THE HILLSIDE AND LAID IT UNDER A CLUMP OF BRACKEN
2487-162474-0026 AS SHE STOOPED TO SET IT SMOOTH AND STRAIGHT THE MOON SWAM OUT OF CLOUD AND FLUNG HER SHADOW BLACK AND GIGANTIC UP THE HILLSIDE
2487-162474-0027 FRIGHTENED SHE RAN HOME RAKED THE FIRE TOGETHER AND MADE HERSELF A CUP OF TEA TO KEEP HER AWAKE SIPPING IT IN THE DIM PARLOUR WHERE FAMILIAR THINGS LOOKED EERIE
2487-162474-0028 AS SHE HALF GUESSED THE ANSWER SHE WAITED IN THE DOVE GREY HOUR THAT PRECEDES DAWN AN HOUR PREGNANT WITH THE FUTURE IT IS FULL OF HOPE
2487-162474-0029 WHAT RARE EMOTION STRUCK OUT OF PAIN IN THE COMING DAY IT IS FULL OF GRIEF FOR HOW MANY BEAUTIFUL THINGS WILL BE TRAMPLED GREAT DREAMS TORN SENSITIVE SPIRITS CRUCIFIED IN THE TIME BETWEEN DUSK AND DUSK
2487-162474-0030 FOR THE DEATH PACK HUNTS AT ALL HOURS LIGHT AND DARK IT IS NO PALE PHANTOM OF DREAMS IT IS MADE NOT OF SPIRIT HOUNDS WITH FIERY EYES A GHASTLY MELODY A GRISLY MUSIC' BUT OF OUR FELLOWS
2487-162474-0031 ALL THAT HAVE STRENGTH WITHOUT PITY SOMETIMES OUR KITH AND KIN OUR NEAREST INTIMATES ARE IN THE FIRST FLIGHT GIVE A VIEW HALLO AS WE SLIP HOPEFULLY UNDER A COVERT ARE IN AT THE DEATH
2487-162474-0032 ONE FLICKER OF MERCIFUL INTENTION AMID RELENTLESS ACTION WOULD REDEEM IT FOR THE WORLD IS FOUNDED AND BUILT UP ON DEATH AND THE REALITY OF DEATH IS NEITHER TO BE QUESTIONED NOR FEARED
2487-162474-0033 DEATH IS A DARK DREAM BUT IT IS NOT A NIGHTMARE IT IS MANKIND'S LACK OF PITY MANKIND'S FATAL PROPENSITY FOR TORTURE THAT IS THE NIGHTMARE WHEN A MAN OR WOMAN CONFRONTED BY HELPLESS TERROR
2487-162474-0034 IS WITHOUT THE IMPULSE TO SAVE THE WORLD BECOMES HELL IT WAS THIS DIMLY BUT PASSIONATELY FELT THAT MADE HAZEL SHRINK FROM REDDIN FOR UNLESS REDDIN WAS WITHOUT THIS IMPULSE TO SAVE
2487-162474-0035 AND HAD THE MIND OF A FIEND WITHOUT PITY HOW COULD HE IN THE MERE PURSUIT OF PLEASURE INFLICT WHOLLY UNNECESSARY TORTURE AS IN FOX HUNTING
2487-162474-0036 SHE WATCHED VENUS SHRINK FROM A SILVER POOL TO A SILVER POINT SHE WAS FULL OF TROUBLE AND UNREST WOULD SHE DREAM OF REDDIN WOULD SHE GO TO SLEEP AT ALL
2487-162474-0037 MISSUS MARSTON'S ARMCHAIR LOOMED IN THE GATHERING LIGHT AND SHE FELT GUILTY AGAIN THE EAST QUICKENED AS IF SOMEONE HAD TURNED UP A LIGHT THERE SHE OPENED THE WINDOW AND IN RUSHED THE INEXPRESSIBLE SWEETNESS OF DAWN
2487-162474-0038 THE BUSH OF SYRINGA BY THE KITCHEN WINDOW SWEPT IN ITS WHOLE FRAGRANCE HEADY AND SENSUOUS SHE TOOK LONG BREATHS OF IT AND THOUGHT OF REDDIN'S GREEN DRESS OF THE QUEER LOOK IN HIS EYES WHEN HE STARED LONG AT HER
2487-162474-0039 A CURIOUS PASSIVITY QUITE FOREIGN TO HER CAME OVER HER NOW AT THE THOUGHT OF REDDIN WHAT WOULD HE LOOK LIKE WHAT WOULD HE SAY WOULD HE HOLD HER ROUGHLY IF SHE WENT TO HUNTER'S SPINNEY AN UNWILLING ELATION POSSESSED HER AS SHE THOUGHT OF IT
2487-162474-0040 IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HER TO WONDER WHY EDWARD DID NOT KISS HER AS REDDIN DID SHE TOOK HIM AS MUCH FOR GRANTED AS A CHILD TAKES ITS PARENTS SUDDENLY THE FIRST BIRD CALLED SILVERLY STARTLING THE DUSK
2487-162474-0041 IT WAS A WOODLARK AND ITS SONG SEEMED EVEN MORE VACILLATING THAN USUAL IN THE VAST HUSH AT THE FIRST NOTE ALL HAZEL'S THOUGHTS OF REDDIN FLED IT SEEMED THAT CLARITY FRESHNESS AND MUSIC WERE BOUND UP IN HER MIND WITH EDWARD
2487-162474-0042 AND THEN THE CHARM'S BROKE SHE THOUGHT HOPEFULLY IF THE CHARM'S BROKE I CANNA DREAM AND I SHANNA GO BUT WHEN SHE CAME TO THE WHITE GARMENT LYING WET AND PALE IN THE HALF LIGHT SHE DREW A SHARP BREATH THERE
2487-162474-0043 IN THE CENTRE LAY ONE MINUTE BLUE PETAL
2487-162474-0044 IT WAS A FAERY FLOWER SHE TOOK IT UP REVERENTLY AND WENT HOME SOLEMN AS A CHILD IN CHURCH WHEN WITH BLUE PETAL UNDER HER PILLOW SHE LAY DOWN SHE FELL ASLEEP IN A MOMENT SHE DREAMT OF REDDIN
2487-162474-0045 FOR HE HAD MORE CONTROL OVER HER THOUGHTS THAN EDWARD WHO APPEALED TO HER EMOTIONS WHILE REDDIN STIRRED HER INSTINCTS WAKING AT MARTHA'S KNOCK SHE SAID TO HERSELF WITH MINGLED HEART SICKNESS AND ELATION
2487-162474-0046 FOXY WANTS ME TO GO
