8307-120457-0000 BLACK JITNEY THE AUTO BIOGRAPHY OF A FORD A TWENTIETH CENTURY REVISION
8307-120457-0001 ALONG WITH SEVERAL HUNDRED BROTHERS AND SISTERS ALL THE MEN IN THAT FACTORY WORE DIAMOND SHIRT STUDS WHILE I WAS WONDERING AT THIS AN OLD MOTOR TRUCK NAMED MERCURY SAID TO ME WITH FEELING
8307-120457-0002 AH IF ALL THE WORKMEN IN THE WORLD COULD BE AS WELL OFF AS THE ONES HERE
8307-120457-0003 I WAS LOADED ON A FREIGHT CAR AND CARRIED MANY MANY MILES THE CAR JOLTED SO TERRIBLY THAT I SHOULD HAVE GONE ALL TO PIECES HAD I NOT BEEN BUILT FOR JARRING NONE OF THE TRAIN CREW SHOWED ME ANY SYMPATHY
8307-120457-0004 THEY WERE WICKED MEN AND USED LANGUAGE THAT FREQUENTLY SENT A TINKLE OF SHAME TO MY MUDGUARDS I DID NOT THEN KNOW AS I DO NOW THAT THE PUREST MINDED AUTOMOBILE HAS TO ENDURE ALL ITS LIFE
8307-120457-0005 WORDS AND TONES OF THE MOST SHOCKING SORT MY FIRST MASTER WAS A CAREFUL AND CONSCIENTIOUS MAN HE HAD A LARGE GARAGE FULL OF FORDS AND HE ALWAYS KEPT A SHARP EYE ON THE DOOR
8307-120457-0006 TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY WHO WALKED OUT CARRIED OFF ONE OF US ONE DAY A MAN CAME IN WITH A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL THAT HE WANTED CHANGED SORRY SAID MY MASTER BUT ALL I HAVE IN MY CASH DRAWER IS
8307-120457-0007 I'LL HAVE TO GIVE YOU THE REST IN FORDS WHEREUPON HE HANDED HIM ME AND ONE OF MY BROTHERS AND THREE EXTRA TIRES WHICH JUST MADE UP THE AMOUNT THIS NEW MASTER WHOSE NAME WAS MISTER PIOUS
8307-120457-0008 WAS VERY GOOD AND HUMANE HE DROVE ME WITH A GENTLE FOOT
8307-120457-0009 BE KIND TO BLACK JITNEY NEVER SCRATCH HIM OR BEND HIM THE CHUBBY LITTLE FELLOWS GREW SO FOND OF ME
8307-120457-0010 WAS A COLD IMPERIOUS WOMAN SHE CARED NOTHING FOR THE FEELINGS OF A FORD SHE WOULD DRIVE ME AT A HEARTLESS PACE TILL MY RADIATOR WAS PARCHED WITH THIRST AND MY GEARS FAIRLY CRIED OUT FOR OIL SPEED WAS HER ONE DESIRE
8307-120457-0011 AND NATURALLY I COULD NOT SATISFY HER EVEN WHEN I RAN SO FAST THAT THE EFFORT MADE ME SHAKE FROM TOP TO TIRES AND I WAS IN DANGER OF LOSING MY LAMPS SHE WOULD CALL ME ICE WAGON AND RATTLE TRAP
8307-120457-0012 AND OTHER CRUEL NAMES AND REFER UNKINDLY TO THE FACT THAT SHE COULD COUNT THE PALINGS OF THE FENCES THAT WE PASSED FINALLY THIS HARD HEARTED WOMAN PREVAILED UPON HER HUSBAND TO SELL ME
8307-120457-0013 AND BUY A BIG SIXTEEN CYLINDER POPE GREGORY THIS CAR AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED WAS SO VICIOUS THAT THE VERY FIRST TIME SHE TOOK IT OUT FOR AN AIRING IT ASSAULTED THREE HELPLESS CHICKENS AND A PIG
8307-120457-0014 MY NEXT MASTER WAS A YOUNG MAN WHOSE PRIVATE LIFE WAS SUCH AS NO WELL BROUGHT UP AUTOMOBILE COULD HAVE APPROVED OF EVERY EVENING AFTER HE HAD KEPT ME IN THE GARAGE ALL DAY LONG FUMING WITH IMPATIENCE AND SPILLED GASOLENE
8307-120457-0015 HE WOULD MAKE ME CARRY HIM FOR HOURS AND HOURS WITH SOME YOUNG WOMAN WHO OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN BETTER WHAT SIGHTS AND SOUNDS I HAD TO ENDURE I WHO HAD ALWAYS KEPT THE STRICTEST DECORUM WORST OF ALL
8307-120457-0016 HIS DEPLORABLE CONDUCT BEGAN TO AFFECT ME I FOUND MYSELF THINKING THOUGHTS WHICH I HAD NEVER PERMITTED TO ENTER MY MIND BEFORE AND LOOKING WITH MORE INTEREST THAN I SHOULD AT SEDUCTIVE SATIN TRIMMED LIMOUSINES
8307-120457-0017 MY MORALITY WAS IN DANGER OF SKIDDING ONE EVENING WHILE MY MASTER WAS DINING WITH A YOUNG WOMAN AT A ROADSIDE INN I WAS LEFT TO WAIT IN THE ADJOINING GARAGE BUT I WAS NOT ALONE
8307-120457-0018 THE MOST IMMORALLY ALLURING CAR I HAD EVER SEEN HER LINES WERE EXQUISITELY SHAPELY SHE WAS A GODDESS ON WHEELS GOOD EVENING SHE SPARKED ENTICINGLY
8307-120457-0019 AREN'T YOU THE CAR THAT STOOD NEXT TO ME AT THE COUNTRY CLUB LAST THURSDAY NIGHT THERE WAS A DAREDEVIL GLEAM IN HER LAMPS WHICH SET MY CARBURETER A SPLUTTER
8307-120457-0020 INFATUATED I KNEW YOU EVEN THOUGH YOU TRIED TO HIDE YOUR NAME WASN'T IT LOVELY JUST US TWO IN THE MOONLIGHT TOUCHING TIRES A QUIVER RAN THROUGH ME
8307-120457-0021 I KNEW THAT UNLESS I COULD BACK OUT IN A HURRY I WAS LOST I TRIED HASTILY TO REVERSE SHE HAD ME COMPLETELY SHORT CIRCUITED HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED HAD NOT MY MASTER ENTERED AT THAT MOMENT AND SAVED ME
8307-120457-0022 THE INSTANT HE LAID HOLD OF MY CRANK I GAVE VENT TO MY PENT UP EMOTIONS IN A WAY THAT NEARLY BURST MY MUFFLER AND WHEN HE PRESSED DOWN THE PEDAL I FAIRLY LEAPED THROUGH THE DOOR IN FLIGHT AS IT WAS
8307-120457-0023 I WAS SEETHING WITH NERVOUSNESS MY MOTOR THROBBED SO VIOLENTLY THAT I COULD HARDLY HOLD STILL WHILE THE YOUNG WOMAN CLIMBED INTO HER SEAT OFF WE SPED DOWN A DARK AND NARROW ROAD
8307-120457-0024 OR OVER THEMSELVES ALL AT ONCE MY LEFT FORE TIRE EXPLODED VIOLENTLY VEERING ME ASIDE INTO A MILE POST MY MASTER AND THE YOUNG WOMAN LANDED IN A CLUMP OF BUSHES BUT I WAS MAIMED FOR LIFE
8307-120457-0025 BAD EXAMPLE AND BAD ASSOCIATION HAD RUINED ME MANY AN INNOCENT UNSOPHISTICATED CAR IS THUS DRIVEN TO DESTRUCTION ALL BECAUSE ITS OWNER FAILS TO LIVE UP TO HIS MORAL RESPONSIBILITY
8307-120457-0026 I LAY THERE ALL THE REST OF THE NIGHT WHILE MY GASOLENE EBBED AWAY DROP BY DROP IN THE MORNING
8307-120457-0027 AND GRAFTING ON SEVERAL FEET OF TIN THEN BEFORE I WAS REALLY CONVALESCENT I WAS SOLD TO A NEW MASTER THIS PERSON WAS A HARSH SPEAKING UNFEELING MAN WHO CARED FOR NOTHING BUT MONEY
8307-120457-0028 HE DROVE UP AND DOWN THE STREETS ALL DAY INVITING PEOPLE TO GET IN AND RIDE AND WHEN THEY DID GET IN HE FORCED EACH ONE OF THEM TO SURRENDER A NICKEL HE WAS VERY CRUEL TO ME
8307-120457-0029 INSTEAD OF SHOWING ANY CONSIDERATION FOR MY BROKEN HEALTH HE WOULD SAY OPENLY WELL I'LL GET WHAT USE I CAN OUT OF THIS ONE AND THEN BUY ANOTHER NOT ONCE DID HE EVER THROW A BLANKET OVER MY HOOD IN COLD WEATHER
8307-120457-0030 OR STEADY MY SLIPPING WHEELS WITH CHAINS
8307-120457-0031 HE WOULD SHUT OFF MY GASOLENE
8307-120457-0032 IT DECLINES INTO SQUALID NEGLECT NO AMOUNT OF PAINTING AND ENAMELING CAN RESTORE ITS YOUTHFUL BLOOM ONE DAY THIS MASTER WAS DRIVING ME THROUGH AN AMUSEMENT PARK WHEN I BROKE DOWN COMPLETELY HE GOT OUT
8307-120457-0033 AND PRODDED ME BRUTALLY IN THE MAGNETO
8307-120457-0034 TO BUDGE HE GREW VERY ANGRY AND THE PEOPLE IN THE TONNEAU DEMANDED THEIR MONEY BACK A CROWD OF IDLERS GATHERED TO WITNESS MY HUMILIATION BECOMING PURPLE IN THE FACE MY MASTER NEARLY
8307-120457-0035 UNJUST IMPRECATIONS AS THOUGH IT WERE MY FAULT THAT MY HEALTH WAS GONE EVEN MAKING DISTRESSING INSINUATIONS AS TO MY ANCESTRY WORDS FAILING HIM
8307-120457-0036 I'D SELL THE THING FOR FIFTY CENTS HE EXCLAIMED WITH A SHOCKING OATH SUDDENLY AN ELDERLY KINDLY FACED MAN PUSHED HIS WAY FORWARD THROUGH THE CROWD I'LL GIVE YOU THAT FOR IT HE SAID ONLY STOP BATTERING IT
8307-120457-0037 FROM THAT MOMENT TO THIS I HAVE NEVER KNOWN ANYTHING BUT HAPPINESS FOR MY DEAR OLD MASTER IS A RETIRED GAS FITTER WHOSE HOBBY IS LANDSCAPE GARDENING RELIEVING ME OF MY TIRED WHEELS
8307-120457-0038 HE HAS PASTURED ME IN THE CENTER OF HIS FRONT YARD AND PLANTED ME FULL OF GERANIUMS I AM LOVINGLY TAKEN CARE OF
