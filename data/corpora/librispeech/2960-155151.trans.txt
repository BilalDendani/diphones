2960-155151-0000 HE WAS BORN AT GOERLITZ IN UPPER LUSATIA
2960-155151-0001 THE OCCUPATION OF A SHOEMAKER IN THIS OBSCURITY HE REMAINED WITH THE CHARACTER OF A VISIONARY AND A MAN OF UNSETTLED MIND UNTIL THE PROMULGATION OF THE ROSICRUCIAN PHILOSOPHY IN HIS PART OF GERMANY
2960-155151-0002 HE PUBLISHED HIS FIRST WORK ENTITLED AURORA OR THE RISING OF THE SUN EMBODYING THE RIDICULOUS NOTIONS OF PARACELSUS AND WORSE CONFOUNDING THE CONFUSION OF THAT WRITER
2960-155151-0003 THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE MIGHT HE CONTENDED BE DISCOVERED BY A DILIGENT SEARCH OF THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS AND MORE ESPECIALLY OF THE APOCALYPSE WHICH ALONE CONTAINED ALL THE SECRETS OF ALCHYMY
2960-155151-0004 HE CONTENDED THAT THE DIVINE GRACE OPERATED BY THE SAME RULES AND FOLLOWED THE SAME METHODS THAT THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE OBSERVED IN THE NATURAL WORLD AND THAT THE MINDS OF MEN WERE PURGED FROM THEIR VICES
2960-155151-0005 HE ACKNOWLEDGED VARIOUS RANKS AND ORDERS OF DEMONS HE PRETENDED TO INVISIBILITY AND ABSOLUTE CHASTITY HE ALSO SAID THAT IF IT PLEASED HIM HE COULD ABSTAIN FOR YEARS FROM MEAT AND DRINK
2960-155151-0006 AND ALL THE NECESSITIES OF THE BODY IT IS NEEDLESS HOWEVER
2960-155151-0007 BY THE MAGISTRATES OF GOERLITZ AND COMMANDED TO LEAVE THE PEN ALONE AND STICK TO HIS WAX THAT HIS FAMILY MIGHT NOT BECOME CHARGEABLE TO THE PARISH HE NEGLECTED THIS GOOD ADVICE AND CONTINUED HIS STUDIES
2960-155151-0008 BURNING MINERALS AND PURIFYING METALS ONE DAY AND MYSTIFYING THE WORD OF GOD ON THE NEXT HE AFTERWARDS WROTE THREE OTHER WORKS AS SUBLIMELY RIDICULOUS AS THE FIRST
2960-155151-0009 THE ONE WAS ENTITLED METALLURGIA AND HAS THE SLIGHT MERIT OF BEING THE LEAST OBSCURE OF HIS COMPOSITIONS ANOTHER WAS CALLED THE TEMPORAL MIRROR OF ETERNITY AND THE LAST
2960-155151-0010 HIS THEOSOPHY REVEALED FULL OF ALLEGORIES AND METAPHORS
2960-155151-0011 BOEHMEN DIED IN SIXTEEN TWENTY FOUR LEAVING BEHIND HIM A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF ADMIRING DISCIPLES MANY OF THEM BECAME DURING THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
2960-155151-0012 AS DISTINGUISHED FOR ABSURDITY AS THEIR MASTER AMONGST WHOM MAY BE MENTIONED GIFFTHEIL WENDENHAGEN JOHN JACOB ZIMMERMANN AND ABRAHAM FRANKENBERG
2960-155151-0013 THEIR HERESY RENDERED THEM OBNOXIOUS TO THE CHURCH OF ROME AND MANY OF THEM SUFFERED LONG IMPRISONMENT AND TORTURE FOR THEIR FAITH ONE NAMED KUHLMANN
2960-155151-0014 WAS BURNED ALIVE AT MOSCOW IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY FOUR ON A CHARGE OF SORCERY BOEHMEN'S WORKS WERE TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH AND PUBLISHED MANY YEARS AFTERWARDS BY AN ENTHUSIAST NAMED WILLIAM LAW
2960-155151-0015 MORMIUS PETER MORMIUS A NOTORIOUS ALCHYMIST AND CONTEMPORARY OF BOEHMEN ENDEAVOURED IN SIXTEEN THIRTY TO INTRODUCE THE ROSICRUCIAN PHILOSOPHY INTO HOLLAND
2960-155151-0016 HE APPLIED TO THE STATES GENERAL TO GRANT HIM A PUBLIC AUDIENCE THAT HE MIGHT EXPLAIN THE TENETS OF THE SECT AND DISCLOSE A PLAN FOR RENDERING HOLLAND THE HAPPIEST AND RICHEST COUNTRY ON THE EARTH
2960-155151-0017 BY MEANS OF THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE AND THE SERVICE OF THE ELEMENTARY SPIRITS THE STATES GENERAL WISELY RESOLVED TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM HE THEREUPON DETERMINED TO SHAME THEM BY PRINTING HIS BOOK
2960-155151-0018 WHICH HE DID AT LEYDEN THE SAME YEAR IT WAS ENTITLED THE BOOK OF THE MOST HIDDEN SECRETS OF NATURE AND WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS THE FIRST TREATING OF PERPETUAL MOTION
2960-155151-0019 THE SECOND OF THE TRANSMUTATION OF METALS AND THE THIRD OF THE UNIVERSAL MEDICINE HE ALSO PUBLISHED SOME GERMAN WORKS UPON THE ROSICRUCIAN PHILOSOPHY AT FRANKFORT IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN
2960-155151-0020 POETRY AND ROMANCE ARE DEEPLY INDEBTED TO THE ROSICRUCIANS FOR MANY A GRACEFUL CREATION THE LITERATURE OF ENGLAND FRANCE AND GERMANY CONTAINS HUNDREDS OF SWEET FICTIONS
2960-155151-0021 THE BEAUTIFUL AND CAPRICIOUS WATER NYMPH UNDINE AROUND WHOM HE HAS THROWN MORE GRACE AND LOVELINESS AND FOR WHOSE IMAGINARY WOES HE HAS EXCITED MORE SYMPATHY THAN EVER WERE BESTOWED ON A SUPERNATURAL BEING
2960-155151-0022 SIR WALTER SCOTT ALSO ENDOWED THE WHITE LADY OF AVENEL WITH MANY OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE UNDINES OR WATER SPRITES GERMAN ROMANCE AND LYRICAL POETRY TEEM WITH ALLUSIONS TO SYLPHS
2960-155151-0023 GNOMES UNDINES AND SALAMANDERS AND THE FRENCH HAVE NOT BEEN BEHIND IN SUBSTITUTING THEM IN WORKS OF FICTION FOR THE MORE CUMBROUS MYTHOLOGY OF GREECE AND ROME THE SYLPHS MORE ESPECIALLY
2960-155151-0024 HAVE BEEN THE FAVOURITES OF THE BARDS AND HAVE BECOME SO FAMILIAR TO THE POPULAR MIND AS TO BE IN A MANNER CONFOUNDED WITH THAT OTHER RACE OF IDEAL BEINGS THE FAIRIES WHO CAN BOAST OF AN ANTIQUITY
2960-155151-0025 JUST AT THE TIME THAT MICHAEL MAYER WAS MAKING KNOWN TO THE WORLD THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A BODY AS THE ROSICRUCIANS THERE WAS BORN IN ITALY A MAN WHO WAS AFTERWARDS DESTINED TO BECOME THE MOST CONSPICUOUS MEMBER OF THE FRATERNITY
2960-155151-0026 THE INGENUITY OF A MORE CONSUMMATE OR MORE SUCCESSFUL IMPOSTOR THAN JOSEPH FRANCIS BORRI HE WAS BORN IN SIXTEEN SIXTEEN ACCORDING TO SOME AUTHORITIES AND IN SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVEN ACCORDING TO OTHERS AT MILAN
2960-155151-0027 WHERE HIS FATHER THE SIGNOR BRANDA BORRI PRACTISED AS A PHYSICIAN AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN JOSEPH WAS SENT TO FINISH HIS EDUCATION AT THE JESUITS COLLEGE IN ROME WHERE HE DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF
2960-155151-0028 BY HIS EXTRAORDINARY MEMORY HE LEARNED EVERY THING TO WHICH HE APPLIED HIMSELF WITH THE UTMOST EASE IN THE MOST VOLUMINOUS WORKS NO FACT WAS TOO MINUTE FOR HIS RETENTION
2960-155151-0029 AND NO STUDY WAS SO ABSTRUSE BUT THAT HE COULD MASTER IT BUT ANY ADVANTAGES HE MIGHT HAVE DERIVED FROM THIS FACILITY WERE NEUTRALISED BY HIS UNGOVERNABLE PASSIONS AND HIS LOVE OF TURMOIL
2960-155151-0030 AND DEBAUCHERY HE WAS INVOLVED IN CONTINUAL DIFFICULTY
2960-155151-0031 IN ONE OF HIS FITS OF STUDIOUSNESS HE GREW ENAMOURED OF ALCHYMY AND DETERMINED TO DEVOTE HIS ENERGIES TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE OF UNFORTUNATE PROPENSITIES HE HAD QUITE SUFFICIENT
2960-155151-0032 BESIDES THIS TO BRING HIM TO POVERTY HIS PLEASURES WERE AS EXPENSIVE AS HIS STUDIES AND BOTH WERE OF A NATURE TO DESTROY HIS HEALTH
2960-155151-0033 AT THE AGE OF THIRTY SEVEN HE FOUND THAT HE COULD NOT LIVE BY THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE AND BEGAN TO LOOK ABOUT FOR SOME OTHER EMPLOYMENT HE BECAME IN SIXTEEN FIFTY THREE
2960-155151-0034 HE CONTINUED IN THIS CAPACITY FOR TWO YEARS LEADING HOWEVER
2960-155151-0035 A SUDDEN CHANGE WAS OBSERVED IN HIS CONDUCT THE ABANDONED RAKE PUT ON THE OUTWARD SEDATENESS OF A PHILOSOPHER THE SCOFFING SINNER PROCLAIMED THAT HE HAD FORSAKEN HIS EVIL WAYS AND WOULD LIVE THENCEFORTH
2960-155151-0036 AND THAT HE HAD OBTAINED POSSESSION OF THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE LIKE HIS PREDECESSOR JACOB BOEHMEN HE MIXED UP RELIGIOUS QUESTIONS WITH HIS PHILOSOPHICAL JARGON AND TOOK MEASURES FOR DECLARING HIMSELF
2960-155151-0037 THE FOUNDER OF A NEW SECT THIS AT ROME ITSELF AND IN THE VERY PALACE OF THE POPE WAS A HAZARDOUS PROCEEDING AND BORRI
2960-155151-0038 JUST AWOKE TO A SENSE OF IT IN TIME TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM THE DUNGEONS OF THE CASTLE OF SAINT ANGELO
2960-155151-0039 HAD GONE BEFORE HIM AND HE FOUND MANY PERSONS READY TO ATTACH THEMSELVES TO HIS FORTUNES ALL WHO WERE DESIROUS OF ENTERING INTO THE NEW COMMUNION TOOK AN OATH OF POVERTY
2960-155151-0040 OF WHOM GOD HAS PREDESTINED ME TO BE THE CHIEF TO THOSE WHO FOLLOW ME ALL JOY SHALL BE GRANTED I SHALL SOON BRING MY CHEMICAL STUDIES TO A HAPPY CONCLUSION BY THE DISCOVERY OF THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
2960-155151-0041 AND BY THIS MEANS WE SHALL ALL HAVE AS MUCH GOLD AS WE DESIRE I AM ASSURED OF THE AID OF THE ANGELIC HOSTS AND MORE ESPECIALLY OF THE ARCHANGEL MICHAEL'S WHEN I BEGAN TO WALK IN THE WAY OF THE SPIRIT
2960-155151-0042 THAT I SHOULD BECOME A PROPHET IN SIGN OF IT I SAW A PALM TREE SURROUNDED WITH ALL THE GLORY OF PARADISE THE ANGELS COME TO ME WHENEVER I CALL AND REVEAL TO ME ALL THE SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSE
2960-155151-0043 THE SYLPHS AND ELEMENTARY SPIRITS OBEY ME AND FLY TO THE UTTERMOST ENDS OF THE WORLD TO SERVE ME AND THOSE WHOM I DELIGHT TO HONOUR BY FORCE OF CONTINUALLY REPEATING SUCH STORIES AS THESE
2960-155151-0044 BORRI SOON FOUND HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF A VERY CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF ADHERENTS
2960-155151-0045 IT WILL BE UNNECESSARY TO REPEAT THE DOCTRINES WHICH HE TAUGHT WITH REGARD TO SOME OF THE DOGMAS OF THE CHURCH OF ROME AND WHICH
2960-155151-0046 AS RIDICULOUS AS HIS PHILOSOPHICAL PRETENSIONS AS THE NUMBER OF HIS FOLLOWERS INCREASED HE APPEARS TO HAVE CHERISHED THE IDEA OF BECOMING ONE DAY A NEW MAHOMET
2960-155151-0047 AND OF FOUNDING IN HIS NATIVE CITY OF MILAN A MONARCHY AND RELIGION OF WHICH HE SHOULD BE THE KING AND THE PROPHET HE HAD TAKEN MEASURES IN THE YEAR SIXTEEN FIFTY EIGHT
2960-155151-0048 THE TRIAL OF HIS FOLLOWERS COMMENCED FORTHWITH AND THE WHOLE OF THEM WERE SENTENCED TO VARIOUS TERMS OF IMPRISONMENT BORRI'S TRIAL PROCEEDED IN HIS ABSENCE
2960-155151-0049 AND LASTED FOR UPWARDS OF TWO YEARS HE WAS CONDEMNED TO DEATH AS A HERETIC AND SORCERER IN SIXTEEN SIXTY ONE AND WAS BURNED IN EFFIGY IN ROME BY THE COMMON HANGMAN BORRI IN THE MEAN TIME
2960-155151-0050 LIVED QUIETLY IN SWITZERLAND INDULGING HIMSELF IN RAILING AT THE INQUISITION AND ITS PROCEEDINGS HE AFTERWARDS WENT TO STRASBOURG INTENDING TO FIX HIS RESIDENCE IN THAT TOWN
2960-155151-0051 HE WAS RECEIVED WITH GREAT CORDIALITY AS A MAN PERSECUTED FOR HIS RELIGIOUS OPINIONS AND WITHAL A GREAT ALCHYMIST HE FOUND THAT SPHERE TOO NARROW FOR HIS ASPIRING GENIUS
2960-155151-0052 AND RETIRED IN THE SAME YEAR TO THE MORE WEALTHY CITY OF AMSTERDAM HE THERE HIRED A MAGNIFICENT HOUSE ESTABLISHED AN EQUIPAGE WHICH ECLIPSED IN BRILLIANCY THOSE OF THE RICHEST MERCHANTS
2960-155151-0053 AND ASSUMED THE TITLE OF EXCELLENCY WHERE HE GOT THE MONEY TO LIVE IN THIS EXPENSIVE STYLE WAS LONG A SECRET THE ADEPTS IN ALCHYMY EASILY EXPLAINED IT AFTER THEIR FASHION SENSIBLE PEOPLE
2960-155151-0054 HE PERFORMED SEVERAL ABLE CURES AND INCREASED HIS REPUTATION SO MUCH THAT HE WAS VAUNTED AS A PRODIGY HE CONTINUED DILIGENTLY THE OPERATIONS OF ALCHYMY AND WAS IN DAILY EXPECTATION
2960-155151-0055 THAT HE SHOULD SUCCEED IN TURNING THE INFERIOR METALS INTO GOLD THIS HOPE NEVER ABANDONED HIM EVEN IN THE WORST EXTREMITY OF HIS FORTUNES AND IN HIS PROSPERITY IT LED HIM
2960-155151-0056 INTO THE MOST FOOLISH EXPENSES BUT HE COULD NOT LONG CONTINUE TO LIVE SO MAGNIFICENTLY UPON THE FUNDS HE HAD BROUGHT FROM ITALY AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
2960-155151-0057 THOUGH IT PROMISED ALL FOR THE WANTS OF THE MORROW NEVER BROUGHT ANY THING FOR THE NECESSITIES OF TO DAY HE WAS OBLIGED IN A FEW MONTHS TO RETRENCH BY GIVING UP HIS LARGE HOUSE
2960-155151-0058 HIS GILDED COACH AND VALUABLE BLOOD HORSES HIS LIVERIED DOMESTICS AND HIS LUXURIOUS ENTERTAINMENTS WITH THIS DIMINUTION OF SPLENDOUR CAME A DIMINUTION OF RENOWN
2960-155151-0059 HAD DRIVEN TO A POOR MAN'S DOOR IN HIS CARRIAGE WITH SIX HORSES HE SANK FROM A PRODIGY INTO AN ORDINARY MAN HIS GREAT FRIENDS SHEWED HIM THE COLD SHOULDER AND HIS HUMBLE FLATTERERS
2960-155151-0060 FROM A MERCHANT NAMED DE MEER TO AID AS HE SAID IN DISCOVERING THE WATER OF LIFE HE ALSO OBTAINED SIX DIAMONDS OF GREAT VALUE ON PRETENCE THAT HE COULD REMOVE THE FLAWS FROM THEM
2960-155151-0061 WITHOUT DIMINISHING THEIR WEIGHT WITH THIS BOOTY HE STOLE AWAY SECRETLY BY NIGHT AND PROCEEDED TO HAMBURGH ON HIS ARRIVAL IN THAT CITY HE FOUND THE CELEBRATED CHRISTINA
2960-155151-0062 THE EX QUEEN OF SWEDEN HE PROCURED AN INTRODUCTION TO HER AND REQUESTED HER PATRONAGE IN HIS ENDEAVOUR TO DISCOVER THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE SHE GAVE HIM SOME ENCOURAGEMENT BUT BORRI FEARING THAT THE MERCHANTS OF AMSTERDAM
2960-155151-0063 WHO HAD CONNEXIONS IN HAMBURGH MIGHT EXPOSE HIS DELINQUENCIES IF HE REMAINED IN THE LATTER CITY PASSED OVER TO COPENHAGEN
2960-155151-0064 AND TOOK A GREAT INTEREST IN THE PROGRESS OF HIS OPERATIONS
2960-155151-0065 HE BECAME IN TIME MUCH ATTACHED TO HIM AND DEFENDED HIM FROM THE JEALOUS ATTACKS OF HIS COURTIERS AND THE INDIGNATION OF THOSE WHO WERE GRIEVED TO SEE THEIR MONARCH THE EASY DUPE OF A CHARLATAN BORRI ENDEAVOURED
2960-155151-0066 BY EVERY MEANS IN HIS POWER TO FIND ALIMENT FOR THIS GOOD OPINION HIS KNOWLEDGE OF MEDICINE WAS USEFUL TO HIM IN THIS RESPECT AND OFTEN STOOD BETWEEN HIM
2960-155151-0067 AND HAD NOTHING TO HOPE FROM THE SUCCEEDING SOVEREIGN HE SOUGHT AN ASYLUM IN ANOTHER COUNTRY HE WENT FIRST TO SAXONY BUT MET SO LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT AND ENCOUNTERED SO MUCH DANGER FROM THE EMISSARIES OF THE INQUISITION
2960-155151-0068 THAT HE DID NOT REMAIN THERE MANY MONTHS ANTICIPATING NOTHING BUT PERSECUTION IN EVERY COUNTRY THAT ACKNOWLEDGED THE SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY OF THE POPE
2960-155151-0069 MUSSULMAN ON HIS ARRIVAL AT THE HUNGARIAN FRONTIER ON HIS WAY TO CONSTANTINOPLE HE WAS ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF BEING CONCERNED
2960-155151-0070 AND A LETTER DESPATCHED TO THE EMPEROR LEOPOLD TO KNOW WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH HIM THE STAR OF HIS FORTUNES WAS ON THE DECLINE THE LETTER REACHED LEOPOLD
2960-155151-0071 TO THE PRISON OF THE INQUISITION AT ROME HE WAS TOO MUCH OF AN IMPOSTOR TO BE DEEPLY TINGED WITH FANATICISM AND WAS NOT UNWILLING TO MAKE A PUBLIC RECANTATION OF HIS HERESIES
2960-155151-0072 IF HE COULD THEREBY SAVE HIS LIFE WHEN THE PROPOSITION WAS MADE TO HIM HE ACCEPTED IT WITH EAGERNESS
2960-155151-0073 INTO THE HARDLY LESS SEVERE ONE OF PERPETUAL IMPRISONMENT BUT HE WAS TOO HAPPY TO ESCAPE THE CLUTCH OF THE EXECUTIONER AT ANY PRICE AND HE MADE THE AMENDE HONORABLE
2960-155151-0074 ALL PERFORMED WITHIN A RECENT PERIOD ZWELFER AND GLAUBER ALSO ENTERED INTO THE DISPUTE AND ATTRIBUTED THE ENMITY OF FATHER KIRCHER TO SPITE AND JEALOUSY AGAINST ADEPTS WHO HAD BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN HIMSELF
2960-155151-0075 IT WAS ALSO PRETENDED THAT GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS TRANSMUTED A QUANTITY OF QUICKSILVER INTO PURE GOLD THE LEARNED BORRICHIUS RELATES THAT HE SAW COINS WHICH HAD BEEN STRUCK OF THIS GOLD AND LENGLET
2960-155151-0076 A MONK OF THE ORDER OF SAINT FRANCIS ATTRACTED SO MUCH NOTICE
2960-155151-0077 VAN HELMONT ALSO PRETENDED TO HAVE ONCE PERFORMED WITH SUCCESS THE PROCESS OF TRANSMUTING QUICKSILVER AND
2960-155151-0078 GLAUBER THE INVENTOR OF THE SALTS WHICH STILL BEAR HIS NAME AND WHO PRACTISED AS A PHYSICIAN AT AMSTERDAM ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ESTABLISHED A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN THAT CITY FOR THE STUDY OF ALCHYMY
2960-155151-0079 AND THE AID OF THAT GRAND AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE SUBSTANCE THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE HE MADE A PROPOSITION TO THE EMPEROR LEOPOLD OF AUSTRIA TO AID HIM IN THESE EXPERIMENTS
2960-155151-0080 MUCH OF HIS PRAISE BUT NONE OF HIS MONEY BECHER AFTERWARDS TRIED THE STATES GENERAL OF HOLLAND WITH NO BETTER SUCCESS WITH REGARD TO THE INNUMERABLE TRICKS BY WHICH IMPOSTORS PERSUADED THE WORLD
2960-155151-0081 AT THE SITTING OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AT PARIS ON THE FIFTEENTH OF APRIL SEVENTEEN TWENTY TWO AS IT RELATES PRINCIPALLY TO THE ALCHYMIC CHEATS OF THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES THE FOLLOWING ABRIDGMENT OF IT
2960-155151-0082 MAY NOT BE OUT OF PLACE IN THIS PORTION OF OUR HISTORY THE INSTANCES OF SUCCESSFUL TRANSMUTATION WERE SO NUMEROUS AND APPARENTLY SO WELL AUTHENTICATED THAT NOTHING SHORT OF SO ABLE AN EXPOSURE
2960-155151-0083 PAINTED TO RESEMBLE THE SAME METAL BETWEEN THE TWO THEY PLACED AS MUCH GOLD OR SILVER DUST AS WAS NECESSARY FOR THEIR PURPOSE THEY THEN PUT IN THEIR LEAD QUICKSILVER OR OTHER INGREDIENTS AND PLACED THEIR POT UPON THE FIRE
2960-155151-0084 THE SAME RESULT WAS PRODUCED IN MANY OTHER WAYS SOME OF THEM USED A HOLLOW WAND FILLED WITH GOLD OR SILVER DUST AND STOPPED AT THE ENDS WITH WAX OR BUTTER
2960-155151-0085 TO DIVERT ATTENTION FROM THE REAL PURPOSE OF THE MANOEUVRE THEY ALSO DRILLED HOLES IN LUMPS OF LEAD
2960-155151-0086 WITH THE AID OF A LITTLE AQUAFORTIS OTHERS IMPOSED BY MEANS OF NAILS HALF IRON AND HALF GOLD OR SILVER THEY PRETENDED THAT THEY REALLY TRANSMUTED THE PRECIOUS HALF FROM IRON BY DIPPING IT IN A STRONG ALCOHOL
2960-155151-0087 AND SHEWED HOW NICELY THE TWO PARTS
2960-155151-0088 BY A MONK TO QUEEN ELIZABETH OF ENGLAND THE BLADE OF WHICH WAS HALF GOLD AND HALF STEEL NOTHING AT ONE TIME WAS MORE COMMON THAN TO SEE COINS HALF GOLD AND HALF SILVER
2960-155151-0089 WHICH HAD BEEN OPERATED UPON BY ALCHYMISTS FOR THE SAME PURPOSES OF TRICKERY
2960-155151-0090 THERE IS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT ALL THE FAMOUS HISTORIES
2960-155151-0091 ARE FOUNDED UPON SOME SUCCESSFUL DECEPTION OF THE KIND ABOVE NARRATED THESE PRETENDED PHILOSOPHERS INVARIABLY DISAPPEARED AFTER THE FIRST OR SECOND EXPERIMENT
2960-155151-0092 OR BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT HAD SUFFICIENT GOLD DUST FOR MORE THAN ONE TRIAL THE DISINTERESTEDNESS OF THESE WOULD BE PHILOSOPHERS LOOKED AT FIRST SIGHT EXTREMELY IMPOSING
