5039-1188-0000 CHAPTER TEN SHAGGY MAN TO THE RESCUE THEY HAD NOT GONE VERY FAR BEFORE BUNGLE WHO HAD RUN ON AHEAD CAME BOUNDING BACK TO SAY THAT THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS WAS JUST BEFORE THEM
5039-1188-0001 AT ONCE THEY HURRIED FORWARD TO SEE WHAT THIS FAMOUS ROAD LOOKED LIKE IT WAS A BROAD ROAD
5039-1188-0002 AND PICKED OUT THE EASIEST PLACES TO GO ALL ITS LENGTH AND BREADTH WAS PAVED WITH SMOOTH BRICKS OF A BRIGHT YELLOW COLOR SO IT WAS SMOOTH
5039-1188-0003 LEAVING HOLES THAT MIGHT CAUSE THE UNWARY TO STUMBLE I WONDER SAID OJO LOOKING UP AND DOWN THE ROAD WHICH WAY TO GO
5039-1188-0004 WITH MY HEART RENDING GROWL MY HORRIBLE SHUDDERFUL GROWL I SHOULD SAY NOT I AM NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING DECLARED THE WOOZY I WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME SIGHED OJO
5039-1188-0005 I DON'T THINK WE NEED BE AFRAID WHEN WE GET TO THE EMERALD CITY FOR UNC NUNKIE HAS TOLD ME THAT OZMA OUR GIRL RULER IS VERY LOVELY AND KIND AND TRIES TO HELP EVERYONE WHO IS IN TROUBLE
5039-1188-0006 BUT THEY SAY THERE ARE MANY DANGERS LURKING ON THE ROAD TO THE GREAT FAIRY CITY AND SO WE MUST BE VERY CAREFUL I HOPE NOTHING WILL BREAK ME
5039-1188-0007 SAID THE GLASS CAT IN A NERVOUS VOICE I'M A LITTLE BRITTLE YOU KNOW AND CAN'T STAND MANY HARD
5039-1188-0008 SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL I'M NOT SURE YOU HAVE A HEART
5039-1188-0009 DO YOU THINK THEY ARE ALL FAST COLORS OJO SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY THEY SEEM FAST ENOUGH WHEN YOU RUN HE REPLIED AND THEN
5039-1188-0010 OH WHAT LOVELY TREES THEY WERE CERTAINLY PRETTY TO LOOK UPON AND THE TRAVELERS HURRIED FORWARD TO OBSERVE THEM MORE CLOSELY
5039-1188-0011 THE PLANTS FORMED ROWS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD AND FROM EACH PLANT ROSE A DOZEN OR MORE OF THE BIG BROAD LEAVES WHICH SWAYED CONTINUALLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
5039-1188-0012 THEY SEEMED TO HAVE A GENERAL GROUNDWORK OF BLUE
5039-1188-0013 GORGEOUS YELLOWS TURNING TO PINK PURPLE ORANGE AND SCARLET MINGLED WITH MORE SOBER BROWNS AND GRAYS EACH APPEARING AS A BLOTCH OR STRIPE ANYWHERE ON A LEAF AND THEN DISAPPEARING
5039-1188-0014 THE CHANGEFUL COLORING OF THE GREAT LEAVES WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL
5039-1188-0015 AND THE NOVELTY OF THE SCENE DREW OUR TRAVELERS CLOSE TO THE LINE OF PLANTS WHERE THEY STOOD WATCHING THEM WITH RAPT INTEREST SUDDENLY A LEAF BENT LOWER THAN USUAL AND TOUCHED THE PATCHWORK GIRL SWIFTLY
5039-1188-0016 IT ENVELOPED HER IN ITS EMBRACE COVERING HER COMPLETELY IN ITS THICK FOLDS AND THEN IT SWAYED BACK UPON ITS STEM WHY SHE'S GONE GASPED OJO IN AMAZEMENT AND LISTENING CAREFULLY HE THOUGHT HE COULD HEAR THE MUFFLED SCREAMS OF SCRAPS COMING FROM THE CENTER OF THE FOLDED LEAF
5039-1188-0017 BUT BEFORE HE COULD THINK WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO TO SAVE HER ANOTHER LEAF BENT DOWN AND CAPTURED THE GLASS CAT
5039-1188-0018 OJO TURNED AND SAW THE WOOZY RUNNING SWIFTLY UP THE ROAD BUT THE LAST LEAF OF THE ROW OF PLANTS SEIZED THE BEAST EVEN AS HE RAN AND INSTANTLY HE DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT THE BOY HAD NO CHANCE TO ESCAPE
5039-1188-0019 HALF A DOZEN OF THE GREAT LEAVES WERE BENDING TOWARD HIM FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND AS HE STOOD HESITATING ONE OF THEM CLUTCHED HIM IN ITS EMBRACE IN A FLASH HE WAS IN THE DARK THEN HE FELT HIMSELF GENTLY LIFTED UNTIL HE WAS SWAYING IN THE AIR
5039-1188-0020 BUT NEITHER STRUGGLES NOR PROTESTS HAD ANY EFFECT WHATEVER THE LEAF HELD HIM FIRMLY AND HE WAS A PRISONER THEN OJO QUIETED HIMSELF AND TRIED TO THINK
5039-1188-0021 EVEN AS HE WAS AND THERE WAS NONE TO SAVE THEM I MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED IT HE SOBBED MISERABLY I'M OJO THE UNLUCKY AND SOMETHING DREADFUL WAS SURE TO HAPPEN TO ME HE PUSHED AGAINST THE LEAF THAT HELD HIM
5039-1188-0022 AND FOUND IT TO BE SOFT BUT THICK AND FIRM
5039-1188-0023 THE MINUTES PASSED AND BECAME HOURS OJO WONDERED HOW LONG ONE COULD LIVE IN SUCH A CONDITION AND IF THE LEAF WOULD GRADUALLY SAP HIS STRENGTH AND EVEN HIS LIFE IN ORDER TO FEED ITSELF THE LITTLE MUNCHKIN BOY HAD NEVER HEARD OF ANY PERSON DYING IN THE LAND OF OZ
5039-1188-0024 BUT HE KNEW ONE COULD SUFFER A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN HIS GREATEST FEAR AT THIS TIME WAS THAT HE WOULD ALWAYS REMAIN IMPRISONED IN THE BEAUTIFUL LEAF AND NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY AGAIN NO SOUND CAME TO HIM THROUGH THE LEAF
5039-1188-0025 ALL AROUND WAS INTENSE SILENCE OJO WONDERED IF SCRAPS HAD STOPPED SCREAMING OR IF THE FOLDS OF THE LEAF PREVENTED HIS HEARING HER BY AND BY HE THOUGHT HE HEARD A WHISTLE AS OF SOME ONE WHISTLING A TUNE YES
5039-1188-0026 IT REALLY MUST BE SOME ONE WHISTLING HE DECIDED FOR HE COULD FOLLOW THE STRAINS OF A PRETTY MUNCHKIN MELODY
5039-1188-0027 THE SOUNDS WERE LOW AND SWEET AND ALTHOUGH THEY REACHED OJO'S EARS VERY FAINTLY THEY WERE CLEAR AND HARMONIOUS COULD THE LEAF WHISTLE OJO WONDERED NEARER AND NEARER CAME THE SOUNDS
5039-1188-0028 AND THEN THEY SEEMED TO BE JUST THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LEAF THAT WAS HUGGING HIM SUDDENLY THE WHOLE LEAF TOPPLED AND FELL CARRYING THE BOY WITH IT AND WHILE HE SPRAWLED AT FULL LENGTH THE FOLDS SLOWLY RELAXED AND SET HIM FREE HE SCRAMBLED QUICKLY TO HIS FEET
5039-1188-0029 AND FOUND THAT A STRANGE MAN WAS STANDING BEFORE HIM A MAN SO CURIOUS IN APPEARANCE THAT THE BOY STARED WITH ROUND EYES HE WAS A BIG MAN WITH SHAGGY WHISKERS SHAGGY EYEBROWS SHAGGY HAIR
5039-1188-0030 ON HIS HEAD WAS A GREEN VELVET HAT WITH A JEWELED BAND WHICH WAS ALL SHAGGY AROUND THE BRIM RICH BUT SHAGGY LACES WERE AT HIS THROAT A COAT WITH SHAGGY EDGES WAS DECORATED WITH DIAMOND BUTTONS
5039-1188-0031 THE VELVET BREECHES HAD JEWELED BUCKLES AT THE KNEES AND SHAGS ALL AROUND THE BOTTOMS ON HIS BREAST HUNG A MEDALLION BEARING A PICTURE OF PRINCESS DOROTHY OF OZ AND IN HIS HAND AS HE STOOD LOOKING AT OJO WAS A SHARP KNIFE SHAPED LIKE A DAGGER
5039-1188-0032 OH EXCLAIMED OJO GREATLY ASTONISHED AT THE SIGHT OF THIS STRANGER AND THEN HE ADDED WHO HAS SAVED ME SIR CAN'T YOU SEE
5039-1188-0033 REPLIED THE OTHER WITH A SMILE I'M THE SHAGGY MAN YES I CAN SEE THAT SAID THE BOY NODDING WAS IT YOU WHO RESCUED ME FROM THE LEAF NONE OTHER YOU MAY BE SURE
5039-1188-0034 BUT TAKE CARE OR I SHALL HAVE TO RESCUE YOU AGAIN OJO GAVE A JUMP FOR HE SAW SEVERAL BROAD LEAVES LEANING TOWARD HIM
5039-1188-0035 PAST THE LAST OF THE GREAT PLANTS AND NOT TILL HE WAS SAFELY BEYOND THEIR REACH DID HE CEASE HIS WHISTLING
5039-1188-0036 SINGING OR WHISTLING IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH MAKES EM BEHAVE AND NOTHING ELSE WILL I ALWAYS WHISTLE AS I GO BY EM AND SO THEY ALWAYS LET ME ALONE TO DAY AS I WENT BY WHISTLING I SAW A LEAF CURLED AND KNEW THERE MUST BE SOMETHING INSIDE IT
5039-1188-0037 I CUT DOWN THE LEAF WITH MY KNIFE AND OUT YOU POPPED LUCKY I PASSED BY WASN'T IT YOU WERE VERY KIND SAID OJO AND I THANK YOU WILL YOU PLEASE RESCUE MY COMPANIONS ALSO WHAT COMPANIONS ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN
5039-1188-0038 THE LEAVES GRABBED THEM ALL SAID THE BOY THERE'S A PATCHWORK GIRL AND
5039-1188-0039 A GIRL MADE OF PATCHWORK YOU KNOW SHE'S ALIVE AND HER NAME IS SCRAPS AND THERE'S A GLASS CAT GLASS ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN ALL GLASS AND ALIVE YES SAID OJO SHE HAS PINK BRAINS
5039-1188-0040 WHY I I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT ANSWERED THE BOY GREATLY PERPLEXED BUT IT'S A QUEER ANIMAL WITH THREE HAIRS ON THE TIP OF ITS TAIL THAT WON'T COME OUT AND WHAT WON'T COME OUT ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN THE TAIL
5039-1188-0041 THE HAIRS WON'T COME OUT BUT YOU'LL SEE THE WOOZY IF YOU'LL PLEASE RESCUE IT AND THEN YOU'LL KNOW JUST WHAT IT IS OF COURSE SAID THE SHAGGY MAN NODDING HIS SHAGGY HEAD AND THEN HE WALKED BACK AMONG THE PLANTS STILL WHISTLING
5039-1188-0042 THE FIRST LEAF HE CUT DOWN RELEASED SCRAPS AND ON SEEING HER THE SHAGGY MAN THREW BACK HIS SHAGGY HEAD OPENED WIDE HIS MOUTH AND LAUGHED SO SHAGGILY AND YET SO MERRILY THAT SCRAPS LIKED HIM AT ONCE
5039-1188-0043 THEN HE TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND MADE HER A LOW BOW SAYING MY DEAR YOU'RE A WONDER I MUST INTRODUCE YOU TO MY FRIEND THE SCARECROW
5039-1188-0044 WHEN HE CUT DOWN THE SECOND LEAF HE RESCUED THE GLASS CAT AND BUNGLE WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT SHE SCAMPERED AWAY LIKE A STREAK AND SOON HAD JOINED OJO WHEN SHE SAT BESIDE HIM PANTING AND TREMBLING THE LAST PLANT OF ALL THE ROW HAD CAPTURED THE WOOZY
5039-1188-0045 AND A BIG BUNCH IN THE CENTER OF THE CURLED LEAF SHOWED PLAINLY WHERE HE WAS
