5136-5094-0000 I WAS AT FIRST INCLINED TO THINK THAT I OUGHT AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE TO RETURN TO LONDON AND BY MY OPEN APPEARANCE REPEL THE CALUMNY WHICH HAD BEEN SPREAD AGAINST ME BUT I HESITATED TO TAKE THIS COURSE
5136-5094-0001 ON RECOLLECTION OF MY FATHER'S DISPOSITION SINGULARLY ABSOLUTE IN HIS DECISIONS AS TO ALL THAT CONCERNED HIS FAMILY HE WAS MOST ABLE CERTAINLY FROM EXPERIENCE TO DIRECT WHAT I OUGHT TO DO
5136-5094-0002 AND FROM HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WHIGS THEN IN POWER HAD INFLUENCE ENOUGH TO OBTAIN A HEARING FOR MY CAUSE SO UPON THE WHOLE I JUDGED IT MOST SAFE TO STATE MY WHOLE STORY IN THE SHAPE OF A NARRATIVE
5136-5094-0003 ADDRESSED TO MY FATHER AND AS THE ORDINARY OPPORTUNITIES OF INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THE HALL AND THE POST TOWN RECURRED RARELY I DETERMINED TO RIDE TO THE TOWN
5136-5094-0004 INDEED I BEGAN TO THINK IT STRANGE THAT THOUGH SEVERAL WEEKS HAD ELAPSED SINCE MY DEPARTURE FROM HOME
5136-5094-0005 EITHER FROM MY FATHER OR OWEN ALTHOUGH RASHLEIGH HAD WRITTEN TO SIR HILDEBRAND OF HIS SAFE ARRIVAL IN LONDON AND OF THE KIND RECEPTION HE HAD MET WITH FROM HIS UNCLE ADMITTING THAT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN TO BLAME
5136-5094-0006 I DID NOT DESERVE IN MY OWN OPINION AT LEAST TO BE SO TOTALLY FORGOTTEN BY MY FATHER AND I THOUGHT MY PRESENT EXCURSION MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF BRINGING A LETTER FROM HIM TO HAND MORE EARLY THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE REACHED ME
5136-5094-0007 BUT BEFORE CONCLUDING MY LETTER CONCERNING THE AFFAIR OF MORRIS I FAILED NOT TO EXPRESS MY EARNEST HOPE AND WISH THAT MY FATHER WOULD HONOUR ME WITH A FEW LINES
5136-5094-0008 WERE IT BUT TO EXPRESS HIS ADVICE AND COMMANDS IN AN AFFAIR OF SOME DIFFICULTY AND WHERE MY KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE COULD NOT BE SUPPOSED ADEQUATE TO MY OWN GUIDANCE
5136-5094-0009 I FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PREVAIL ON MYSELF TO URGE MY ACTUAL RETURN TO LONDON AS A PLACE OF RESIDENCE AND I DISGUISED MY UNWILLINGNESS TO DO SO UNDER APPARENT SUBMISSION TO MY FATHER'S WILL
5136-5094-0010 WHICH AS I IMPOSED IT ON MYSELF AS A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR NOT URGING MY FINAL DEPARTURE FROM OSBALDISTONE HALL WOULD I DOUBTED NOT BE RECEIVED AS SUCH BY MY PARENT BUT I BEGGED PERMISSION TO COME TO LONDON
5136-5094-0011 FOR A SHORT TIME AT LEAST TO MEET AND REFUTE THE INFAMOUS CALUMNIES WHICH HAD BEEN CIRCULATED CONCERNING ME IN SO PUBLIC A MANNER HAVING MADE UP MY PACKET
5136-5094-0012 I RODE OVER TO THE POST TOWN
5136-5094-0013 BY DOING SO I OBTAINED POSSESSION SOMEWHAT EARLIER THAN I SHOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE OF THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM MY FRIEND MISTER OWEN DEAR MISTER FRANCIS YOURS RECEIVED PER FAVOUR OF MISTER R OSBALDISTONE
5136-5094-0014 AND NOTE THE CONTENTS SHALL DO MISTER R O SUCH CIVILITIES AS ARE IN MY POWER AND HAVE TAKEN HIM TO SEE THE BANK AND CUSTOM HOUSE HE SEEMS A SOBER STEADY YOUNG GENTLEMAN AND TAKES TO BUSINESS
5136-5094-0015 COULD HAVE WISHED ANOTHER PERSON HAD TURNED HIS MIND THAT WAY BUT GOD'S WILL BE DONE AS CASH MAY BE SCARCE IN THOSE PARTS HAVE TO TRUST YOU WILL EXCUSE MY ENCLOSING A GOLDSMITH'S BILL AT SIX DAYS SIGHT ON MESSRS
5136-5094-0016 HOOPER AND GIRDER OF NEWCASTLE
5136-5094-0017 WHICH I DOUBT NOT WILL BE DULY HONOURED I REMAIN AS IN DUTY BOUND DEAR MISTER FRANK YOUR VERY RESPECTFUL AND OBEDIENT SERVANT JOSEPH OWEN POSTSCRIPTUM
5136-5094-0018 HOPE YOU WILL ADVISE THE ABOVE COMING SAFE TO HAND AM SORRY WE HAVE SO FEW OF YOURS YOUR FATHER SAYS HE IS AS USUAL BUT LOOKS POORLY FROM THIS EPISTLE WRITTEN IN OLD OWEN'S FORMAL STYLE
5136-5094-0019 WITH A VIEW TO POSSESS HIM OF RASHLEIGH'S REAL CHARACTER ALTHOUGH FROM THE COURSE OF POST IT SEEMED CERTAIN THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE RECEIVED IT YET I HAD SENT IT BY THE USUAL CONVEYANCE FROM THE HALL
5136-5094-0020 AND HAD NO REASON TO SUSPECT THAT IT COULD MISCARRY UPON THE ROAD AS IT COMPRISED MATTERS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE BOTH TO MY FATHER AND TO MYSELF I SAT DOWN IN THE POST OFFICE AND AGAIN WROTE TO OWEN
5136-5094-0021 IF IT HAD REACHED HIM IN SAFETY I ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THE RECEIPT OF THE BILL AND PROMISED TO MAKE USE OF THE CONTENTS IF I SHOULD HAVE ANY OCCASION FOR MONEY I THOUGHT INDEED IT WAS ODD
5136-5094-0022 THAT MY FATHER SHOULD LEAVE THE CARE OF SUPPLYING MY NECESSITIES TO HIS CLERK BUT I CONCLUDED IT WAS A MATTER ARRANGED BETWEEN THEM AT ANY RATE OWEN WAS A BACHELOR RICH IN HIS WAY AND PASSIONATELY ATTACHED TO ME
5136-5094-0023 AND I EXPRESSED MYSELF TO THIS PURPOSE TO MISTER OWEN A SHOPKEEPER IN A LITTLE TOWN TO WHOM THE POST MASTER DIRECTED ME READILY GAVE ME IN GOLD THE AMOUNT OF MY BILL ON MESSRS HOOPER AND GIRDER
5136-5094-0024 SO THAT I RETURNED TO OSBALDISTONE HALL A GOOD DEAL RICHER THAN I HAD SET FORTH THIS RECRUIT TO MY FINANCES WAS NOT A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE TO ME AS I WAS NECESSARILY INVOLVED IN SOME EXPENSES AT OSBALDISTONE HALL
5136-5094-0025 AND I HAD SEEN WITH SOME UNEASY IMPATIENCE THAT THE SUM WHICH MY TRAVELLING EXPENSES HAD LEFT UNEXHAUSTED AT MY ARRIVAL THERE WAS IMPERCEPTIBLY DIMINISHING THIS SOURCE OF ANXIETY WAS FOR THE PRESENT REMOVED
5136-5094-0026 ON MY ARRIVAL AT THE HALL I FOUND THAT SIR HILDEBRAND AND ALL HIS OFFSPRING HAD GONE DOWN TO THE LITTLE HAMLET CALLED TRINLAY KNOWES TO SEE
5136-5094-0027 I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NONE SUCH IN SCOTLAND NA NA ANSWERED ANDREW BOLDLY THEN SHADED AWAY HIS NEGATIVE WITH UNLESS IT BE ON FASTERN'S E'EN OR THE LIKE O THAT
5136-5094-0028 BUT INDEED IT'S NO MUCKLE MATTER WHAT THE FOLK DO TO THE MIDDEN POOTRY FOR THEY HAD SICCAN A SKARTING AND SCRAPING IN THE YARD THAT THERE'S NAE GETTING A BEAN OR PEA KEEPIT FOR THEM
5136-5094-0029 THE TURRET DOOR TO WHICH HE ALLUDED OPENED TO THE GARDEN AT THE BOTTOM OF A WINDING STAIR LEADING DOWN FROM MISTER RASHLEIGH'S APARTMENT THIS AS I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED WAS SITUATED IN A SEQUESTERED PART OF THE HOUSE
5136-5094-0030 COMMUNICATING WITH THE LIBRARY BY A PRIVATE ENTRANCE AND BY ANOTHER INTRICATE AND DARK VAULTED PASSAGE WITH THE REST OF THE HOUSE
5136-5094-0031 FROM THE TURRET DOOR TO A LITTLE POSTERN IN THE WALL OF THE GARDEN
5136-5094-0032 COULD LEAVE THE HALL OR RETURN TO IT AT PLEASURE
5136-5094-0033 WITHOUT HIS ABSENCE OR PRESENCE ATTRACTING ANY OBSERVATION BUT DURING HIS ABSENCE THE STAIR AND THE TURRET DOOR WERE ENTIRELY DISUSED AND THIS MADE ANDREW'S OBSERVATION SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE HAVE YOU OFTEN OBSERVED THAT DOOR OPEN
5136-5094-0034 WAS MY QUESTION NO JUST THAT OFTEN NEITHER BUT I HAE NOTICED IT ANCE OR TWICE
5136-5094-0035 FOR FEAR OF BOGLES AND BROWNIES
5136-5094-0036 WAD LAY A GHAIST TWICE AS FAST AS HIM WI HIS HOLY WATER AND HIS IDOLATROUS TRINKETS
5136-5094-0037 LEAST HE DISNA TAKE ME UP WHEN I TELL HIM THE LEARNED NAMES O THE PLANTS OF FATHER VAUGHAN WHO DIVIDED HIS TIME AND HIS GHOSTLY CARE BETWEEN OSBALDISTONE HALL AND ABOUT HALF A DOZEN MANSIONS OF CATHOLIC GENTLEMEN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
5136-5094-0038 I HAVE AS YET SAID NOTHING FOR I HAD SEEN BUT LITTLE HE WAS AGED ABOUT SIXTY OF A GOOD FAMILY AS I WAS GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND IN THE NORTH OF A STRIKING AND IMPOSING PRESENCE GRAVE IN HIS EXTERIOR
5136-5094-0039 AND MUCH RESPECTED AMONG THE CATHOLICS OF NORTHUMBERLAND AS A WORTHY AND UPRIGHT MAN YET FATHER VAUGHAN DID NOT ALTOGETHER LACK THOSE PECULIARITIES WHICH DISTINGUISH HIS ORDER THERE HUNG ABOUT HIM AN AIR OF MYSTERY WHICH IN PROTESTANT EYES
5136-5094-0040 SAVOURED OF PRIESTCRAFT THE NATIVES SUCH THEY MIGHT BE WELL TERMED OF OSBALDISTONE HALL LOOKED UP TO HIM WITH MUCH MORE FEAR OR AT LEAST MORE AWE THAN AFFECTION HIS CONDEMNATION OF THEIR REVELS WAS EVIDENT FROM THEIR BEING DISCONTINUED IN SOME MEASURE
5136-5094-0041 HE HAD THE WELL BRED INSINUATING AND ALMOST FLATTERING ADDRESS PECULIAR TO THE CLERGY OF HIS PERSUASION
5136-5094-0042 WHILE THE PRIEST PRIVILEGED BY HIS ORDER TO MINGLE WITH PERSONS OF ALL CREEDS IS OPEN ALERT AND LIBERAL IN HIS INTERCOURSE WITH THEM DESIROUS OF POPULARITY
5136-5094-0043 AND USUALLY SKILFUL IN THE MODE OF OBTAINING IT FATHER VAUGHAN WAS A PARTICULAR ACQUAINTANCE OF RASHLEIGH'S OTHERWISE IN ALL PROBABILITY HE WOULD SCARCE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN HIS FOOTING AT OSBALDISTONE HALL
5136-5094-0044 THIS GAVE ME NO DESIRE TO CULTIVATE HIS INTIMACY NOR DID HE SEEM TO MAKE ANY ADVANCES TOWARDS MINE SO OUR OCCASIONAL INTERCOURSE WAS CONFINED TO THE EXCHANGE OF MERE CIVILITY I CONSIDERED IT AS EXTREMELY PROBABLE
5136-5094-0045 THAT MISTER VAUGHAN MIGHT OCCUPY RASHLEIGH'S APARTMENT DURING HIS OCCASIONAL RESIDENCE AT THE HALL AND HIS PROFESSION RENDERED IT LIKELY THAT HE SHOULD OCCASIONALLY BE A TENANT OF THE LIBRARY
5136-5094-0046 AND THE PRIEST WAS MARKED WITH SOMETHING LIKE THE SAME MYSTERY WHICH CHARACTERISED HER COMMUNICATIONS WITH RASHLEIGH I HAD NEVER HEARD HER MENTION VAUGHAN'S NAME OR EVEN ALLUDE TO HIM EXCEPTING ON THE OCCASION OF OUR FIRST MEETING
5136-5094-0047 BESIDES HERSELF IN OSBALDISTONE HALL YET ALTHOUGH SILENT WITH RESPECT TO FATHER VAUGHAN HIS ARRIVAL AT THE HALL NEVER FAILED TO IMPRESS MISS VERNON WITH AN ANXIOUS AND FLUTTERING TREMOR
5136-5094-0048 WHICH LASTED UNTIL THEY HAD EXCHANGED ONE OR TWO SIGNIFICANT GLANCES WHATEVER THE MYSTERY MIGHT BE WHICH OVERCLOUDED THE DESTINIES OF THIS BEAUTIFUL AND INTERESTING FEMALE IT WAS CLEAR THAT FATHER VAUGHAN WAS IMPLICATED IN IT
5136-5094-0049 UNLESS INDEED I COULD SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS THE AGENT EMPLOYED TO PROCURE HER SETTLEMENT IN THE CLOISTER IN THE EVENT OF HER REJECTING A UNION WITH EITHER OF MY COUSINS
5136-5094-0050 AN OFFICE WHICH WOULD SUFFICIENTLY ACCOUNT FOR HER OBVIOUS EMOTION AT HIS APPEARANCE AS TO THE REST THEY DID NOT SEEM TO CONVERSE MUCH TOGETHER OR EVEN TO SEEK EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY THEIR LEAGUE IF ANY SUBSISTED BETWEEN THEM
5136-5094-0051 WAS OF A TACIT AND UNDERSTOOD NATURE OPERATING ON THEIR ACTIONS WITHOUT ANY NECESSITY OF SPEECH I RECOLLECTED HOWEVER ON REFLECTION THAT I HAD ONCE OR TWICE DISCOVERED SIGNS PASS BETWIXT THEM
5136-5094-0052 WHICH I HAD AT THE TIME SUPPOSED TO BEAR REFERENCE TO SOME HINT CONCERNING MISS VERNON'S RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES KNOWING HOW ARTFULLY THE CATHOLIC CLERGY MAINTAIN AT ALL TIMES AND SEASONS THEIR INFLUENCE OVER THE MINDS OF THEIR FOLLOWERS
5136-5094-0053 BUT NOW I WAS DISPOSED TO ASSIGN TO THESE COMMUNICATIONS A DEEPER AND MORE MYSTERIOUS IMPORT DID HE HOLD PRIVATE MEETINGS WITH MISS VERNON IN THE LIBRARY WAS A QUESTION WHICH OCCUPIED MY THOUGHTS AND IF SO FOR WHAT PURPOSE
5136-5094-0054 TO SUCH CLOSE CONFIDENCE THESE QUESTIONS AND DIFFICULTIES PRESSED ON MY MIND WITH AN INTEREST WHICH WAS GREATLY INCREASED BY THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF RESOLVING THEM
5136-5094-0055 I HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO SUSPECT THAT MY FRIENDSHIP FOR DIANA VERNON WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SO DISINTERESTED AS IN WISDOM IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN
5136-5094-0056 I HAD ALREADY FELT MYSELF BECOMING JEALOUS OF THE CONTEMPTIBLE LOUT THORNCLIFF AND TAKING MORE NOTICE THAN IN PRUDENCE OR DIGNITY OF FEELING I OUGHT TO HAVE DONE OF HIS SILLY ATTEMPTS TO PROVOKE ME
5136-5094-0057 AND NOW I WAS SCRUTINISING THE CONDUCT OF MISS VERNON WITH THE MOST CLOSE AND EAGER OBSERVATION WHICH I IN VAIN ENDEAVOURED TO PALM ON MYSELF AS THE OFFSPRING OF IDLE CURIOSITY
5136-5094-0058 ALL THESE LIKE BENEDICK'S BRUSHING HIS HAT OF A MORNING WERE SIGNS THAT THE SWEET YOUTH WAS IN LOVE AND WHILE MY JUDGMENT STILL DENIED THAT I HAD BEEN GUILTY OF FORMING AN ATTACHMENT SO IMPRUDENT
