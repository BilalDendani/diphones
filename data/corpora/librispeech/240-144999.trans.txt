240-144999-0000 I COUNT IT AS RATHER STRANGE THAT AMERICAN AND ENGLISH SPORTSMEN
240-144999-0001 BUT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THESE IS VERY FEW
240-144999-0002 FORTY YEARS AGO A SPORTSMAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN DEFINED ACCORDING TO THE STANDARDS OF THAT PERIOD AS A MAN WHO HUNTS WILD GAME FOR PLEASURE THOSE WERE THE DAYS WHEREIN NO ONE FORESAW THE WHOLESALE ANNIHILATION OF SPECIES
240-144999-0003 AND THERE WERE NO WILDERNESS GAME PRESERVES IN THOSE DAYS GENTLEMEN SHOT FEMALE HOOFED GAME TRAPPED BEARS IF THEY FELT LIKE IT
240-144999-0004 AND NO ONE MADE ANY FUSS WHATEVER ABOUT THE WASTE OR EXTERMINATION OF WILD LIFE THOSE WERE THE DAYS OF OX TEAMS AND BROAD AXES TO DAY WE ARE LIVING IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT WORLD
240-144999-0005 A WORLD OF GRINDING CRUNCHING PULVERIZING PROGRESS A WORLD OF ANNIHILATION OF THE WORKS OF NATURE AND WHAT IS A SPORTSMAN TO DAY A SPORTSMAN IS A MAN WHO LOVES NATURE AND WHO IN THE ENJOYMENT OF THE OUTDOOR LIFE AND EXPLORATION
240-144999-0006 TAKES A REASONABLE TOLL OF NATURE'S WILD ANIMALS BUT NOT FOR COMMERCIAL PROFIT AND ONLY SO LONG AS HIS HUNTING DOES NOT PROMOTE THE EXTERMINATION OF SPECIES IN VIEW OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF WILD LIFE ALL OVER THE HABITABLE GLOBE
240-144999-0007 AND THE STEADY EXTERMINATION OF SPECIES THE ETHICS OF SPORTSMANSHIP HAS BECOME A MATTER OF TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE IF A MAN CAN SHOOT THE LAST LIVING BURCHELL ZEBRA OR PRONG HORNED ANTELOPE AND BE A SPORTSMAN AND A GENTLEMAN
240-144999-0008 BUT THE REAL GENTLEMEN SPORTSMEN OF THE WORLD ARE NOT INSENSIBLE TO THE DUTIES OF THE HOUR IN REGARD TO THE TAKING OR NOT TAKING OF GAME THE TIME HAS COME WHEN CANON LAWS SHOULD BE LAID DOWN OF WORLD WIDE APPLICATION
240-144999-0009 AND SO THOROUGHLY ACCEPTED AND PROMULGATED THAT THEIR BINDING FORCE CAN NOT BE IGNORED AMONG OTHER THINGS IT IS TIME FOR A LIST OF SPECIES TO BE PUBLISHED WHICH NO MAN CLAIMING TO BE EITHER A GENTLEMAN OR A SPORTSMAN
240-144999-0010 CAN SHOOT FOR AUGHT ELSE THAN PRESERVATION IN A PUBLIC MUSEUM OF COURSE THIS LIST WOULD BE COMPOSED OF THE SPECIES THAT ARE THREATENED WITH EXTERMINATION OF AMERICAN ANIMALS IT SHOULD INCLUDE THE PRONG HORNED ANTELOPE MEXICAN MOUNTAIN SHEEP
240-144999-0011 THE CALIFORNIA GRIZZLY BEAR MULE DEER WEST INDIAN SEAL AND CALIFORNIA ELEPHANT SEAL AND WALRUS IN AFRICA THAT LIST SHOULD INCLUDE THE ELAND
240-144999-0012 LEUCORYX ANTELOPE AND WHALE HEADED STORK
240-144999-0013 LYRE BIRD AND THE MALLEE BIRD THINK WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO THE SPECIES NAMED ABOVE IF ALL THE SPORTSMEN OF THE WORLD WOULD UNITE IN THEIR DEFENSE BOTH ACTIVELY AND PASSIVELY IT WOULD BE TO THOSE SPECIES
240-144999-0014 A MODUS VIVENDI WORTH WHILE PRIOR TO NINETEEN O EIGHT NO EFFORT SO FAR AS WE ARE AWARE EVER HAD BEEN MADE TO PROMOTE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE AND UP TO DATE CODE OF ETHICS FOR SPORTSMEN WHO SHOOT
