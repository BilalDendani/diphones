7558-89894-0000 BUT THE ISLANDERS WHILE TO THE UTMOST OF THEIR POWER THEY REPELLED FORCE WITH FORCE IMPLORED THE ASSISTANCE OF THE DIVINE MERCY AND WITH CONSTANT IMPRECATIONS INVOKED THE VENGEANCE OF HEAVEN
7558-89894-0001 AND THOUGH SUCH AS CURSE CANNOT INHERIT THE KINGDOM OF GOD YET IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THOSE WHO WERE JUSTLY CURSED ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR IMPIETY
7558-89894-0002 BUT WHEN THE BISHOP CAME THITHER THAT DEVOUT TEACHER FOUND IN HIM THE GREATEST HELP IN GOVERNING
7558-89894-0003 BOTH A KNOWLEDGE OF THE SCRIPTURES AND AN EXAMPLE OF GOOD WORKS AFTER HE HAD DEPARTED TO THE LORD CUTHBERT BECAME PROVOST OF THAT MONASTERY WHERE HE INSTRUCTED MANY IN THE RULE OF MONASTIC LIFE
7558-89894-0004 BOTH BY THE AUTHORITY OF A MASTER AND THE EXAMPLE OF HIS OWN BEHAVIOUR NOR DID HE BESTOW HIS TEACHING AND HIS EXAMPLE IN THE MONASTIC LIFE ON HIS MONASTERY ALONE
7558-89894-0005 BUT LABOURED FAR AND WIDE TO CONVERT THE PEOPLE DWELLING ROUND ABOUT FROM THE LIFE OF FOOLISH CUSTOM TO THE LOVE OF HEAVENLY JOYS FOR MANY PROFANED THE FAITH WHICH THEY HELD BY THEIR WICKED ACTIONS AND SOME ALSO
7558-89894-0006 IN THE TIME OF A PESTILENCE NEGLECTING THE MYSTERIES OF THE FAITH WHICH THEY HAD RECEIVED HAD RECOURSE TO THE FALSE REMEDIES OF IDOLATRY AS IF THEY COULD HAVE PUT A STOP TO THE PLAGUE SENT FROM GOD BY INCANTATIONS AMULETS
7558-89894-0007 OR ANY OTHER SECRETS OF THE DEVIL'S ART IN ORDER TO CORRECT THE ERROR OF BOTH SORTS HE OFTEN WENT FORTH FROM THE MONASTERY SOMETIMES ON HORSEBACK BUT OFTENER ON FOOT
7558-89894-0008 AND WENT TO THE NEIGHBOURING TOWNSHIPS WHERE HE PREACHED THE WAY OF TRUTH TO SUCH AS HAD GONE ASTRAY WHICH BOISIL ALSO IN HIS TIME HAD BEEN WONT TO DO IT WAS THEN THE CUSTOM OF THE ENGLISH PEOPLE THAT WHEN A CLERK OR PRIEST CAME TO A TOWNSHIP
7558-89894-0009 THEY ALL AT HIS SUMMONS FLOCKED TOGETHER TO HEAR THE WORD WILLINGLY HEARD WHAT WAS SAID AND STILL MORE WILLINGLY PRACTISED THOSE THINGS THAT THEY COULD HEAR AND UNDERSTAND AND SUCH WAS CUTHBERT'S SKILL IN SPEAKING
7558-89894-0010 SO KEEN HIS DESIRE TO PERSUADE MEN OF WHAT HE TAUGHT SUCH A LIGHT SHONE IN HIS ANGELIC FACE THAT NO MAN PRESENT DARED TO CONCEAL FROM HIM THE SECRETS OF HIS HEART BUT ALL OPENLY REVEALED IN CONFESSION WHAT THEY HAD DONE
7558-89894-0011 AND HAVING CONFESSED THEIR SINS THEY WIPED THEM OUT BY FRUITS WORTHY OF REPENTANCE AS HE BADE THEM HE WAS WONT CHIEFLY TO RESORT TO THOSE PLACES AND PREACH IN THOSE VILLAGES WHICH WERE SITUATED AFAR OFF AMID STEEP AND WILD MOUNTAINS
7558-89894-0012 SO THAT OTHERS DREADED TO GO THITHER AND WHEREOF THE POVERTY AND BARBARITY RENDERED THEM INACCESSIBLE TO OTHER TEACHERS BUT HE DEVOTING HIMSELF ENTIRELY TO THAT PIOUS LABOUR SO INDUSTRIOUSLY MINISTERED TO THEM WITH HIS WISE TEACHING THAT
7558-89894-0013 WHEN HE WENT FORTH FROM THE MONASTERY HE WOULD OFTEN STAY A WHOLE WEEK SOMETIMES TWO OR THREE OR EVEN SOMETIMES A FULL MONTH BEFORE HE RETURNED HOME CONTINUING AMONG THE HILL FOLK TO CALL THAT SIMPLE PEOPLE BY HIS PREACHING AND GOOD WORKS
7558-89894-0014 TO THE THINGS OF HEAVEN THIS VENERABLE SERVANT OF THE LORD HAVING THUS SPENT MANY YEARS IN THE MONASTERY OF MAILROS AND THERE BECOME CONSPICUOUS BY GREAT TOKENS OF VIRTUE
7558-89894-0015 THAT HE MIGHT THERE ALSO BY HIS AUTHORITY AS PROVOST AND BY THE EXAMPLE OF HIS OWN PRACTICE INSTRUCT THE BRETHREN IN THE OBSERVANCE OF REGULAR DISCIPLINE FOR THE SAME REVEREND FATHER THEN GOVERNED THAT PLACE ALSO AS ABBOT
7558-89894-0016 FROM ANCIENT TIMES THE BISHOP WAS WONT TO RESIDE THERE WITH HIS CLERGY AND THE ABBOT WITH HIS MONKS
7558-89894-0017 AND BEING INFESTED BY EVIL SPIRITS WAS VERY ILL SUITED FOR HUMAN HABITATION BUT IT BECAME IN ALL RESPECTS HABITABLE AT THE DESIRE OF THE MAN OF GOD FOR AT HIS COMING THE WICKED SPIRITS DEPARTED
7558-89894-0018 WHEN AFTER EXPELLING THE ENEMY HE HAD WITH THE HELP OF THE BRETHREN BUILT HIMSELF A NARROW DWELLING WITH A MOUND ABOUT IT AND THE NECESSARY CELLS IN IT TO WIT AN ORATORY AND A COMMON LIVING ROOM
7558-89894-0019 HE ORDERED THE BROTHERS TO DIG A PIT IN THE FLOOR OF THE ROOM ALTHOUGH THE GROUND WAS HARD AND STONY AND NO HOPES APPEARED OF ANY SPRING
7558-89894-0020 AND AFFORDED THE MAN OF GOD THE MEANS WHICH HE HAD DESIRED OF SUPPORTING HIMSELF BY HIS OWN LABOUR WHEN HE HAD HERE SERVED GOD IN SOLITUDE MANY YEARS
7558-89894-0021 THE MOUND WHICH ENCOMPASSED HIS DWELLING BEING SO HIGH THAT HE COULD SEE NOTHING FROM IT BUT HEAVEN WHICH HE THIRSTED TO ENTER IT HAPPENED THAT A GREAT SYNOD WAS ASSEMBLED IN THE PRESENCE OF KING EGFRID NEAR THE RIVER ALNE AT A PLACE CALLED
7558-89894-0022 IN WHICH ARCHBISHOP THEODORE OF BLESSED MEMORY PRESIDED AND THERE CUTHBERT WAS WITH ONE MIND AND CONSENT OF ALL
7558-89894-0023 HEREBERT A MAN OF HOLY LIFE WHO HAD LONG BEEN UNITED WITH THE MAN OF GOD
7558-89894-0024 I BESEECH YOU BY THE LORD NOT TO FORSAKE ME BUT TO REMEMBER YOUR MOST FAITHFUL COMPANION AND ENTREAT THE MERCY OF GOD THAT AS WE HAVE SERVED HIM TOGETHER UPON EARTH SO WE MAY DEPART TOGETHER TO BEHOLD HIS GRACE IN HEAVEN
7558-89894-0025 FOR YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE ALWAYS ENDEAVOURED TO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE WORDS OF YOUR LIPS AND LIKEWISE WHATSOEVER FAULTS I HAVE COMMITTED EITHER THROUGH IGNORANCE OR FRAILTY I HAVE INSTANTLY SOUGHT TO AMEND ACCORDING TO THE JUDGEMENT OF YOUR WILL
7558-89894-0026 THE BISHOP APPLIED HIMSELF TO PRAYER AND HAVING PRESENTLY HAD INTIMATION IN THE SPIRIT THAT HE HAD OBTAINED WHAT HE ASKED OF THE LORD HE SAID RISE BROTHER AND DO NOT WEEP BUT REJOICE GREATLY BECAUSE THE MERCY OF HEAVEN
7558-89894-0027 THROUGH THE DISPENSATION OF THE LORD'S MERCY AS MAY BE BELIEVED TO THE END THAT IF HE WAS IN ANY WISE INFERIOR IN MERIT TO THE BLESSED CUTHBERT THAT WHICH WAS LACKING MIGHT BE SUPPLIED BY THE CHASTENING PAIN OF A LONG SICKNESS
7558-89894-0028 AND THE SAME TIME WITH HIM SO HE MIGHT BE ACCOUNTED WORTHY TO BE RECEIVED INTO THE LIKE ABODE OF ETERNAL BLISS THE MOST REVEREND FATHER DIED IN THE ISLE OF FARNE
7558-89894-0029 IN ORDER TO SHOW FORTH THE GREAT GLORY OF THE LIFE AFTER DEATH OF THE MAN OF GOD CUTHBERT WHEREAS THE LOFTINESS OF HIS LIFE BEFORE HIS DEATH HAD BEEN REVEALED BY THE TESTIMONY OF MANY MIRACLES WHEN HE HAD BEEN BURIED ELEVEN YEARS
7558-89894-0030 DIVINE PROVIDENCE PUT IT INTO THE MINDS OF THE BRETHREN TO TAKE UP HIS BONES THEY THOUGHT TO FIND THEM DRY AND ALL THE REST OF THE BODY CONSUMED AND TURNED TO DUST AFTER THE MANNER OF THE DEAD AND THEY DESIRED TO PUT THEM INTO A NEW COFFIN AND TO LAY THEM IN THE SAME PLACE
7558-89894-0031 BUT ABOVE THE PAVEMENT FOR THE HONOUR DUE TO HIM THEY MADE KNOWN THEIR RESOLVE TO BISHOP EADBERT AND HE CONSENTED TO IT AND BADE THEM TO BE MINDFUL TO DO IT ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF HIS BURIAL
7558-89894-0032 THEY DID SO AND OPENING THE GRAVE FOUND ALL THE BODY WHOLE AS IF HE WERE STILL ALIVE AND THE JOINTS OF THE LIMBS PLIABLE LIKE ONE ASLEEP RATHER THAN DEAD BESIDES ALL THE VESTMENTS IN WHICH HE WAS CLOTHED WERE NOT ONLY UNDEFILED
7558-89894-0033 BUT MARVELLOUS TO BEHOLD BEING FRESH AND BRIGHT AS AT THE FIRST THE BROTHERS SEEING THIS WERE STRUCK WITH A GREAT DREAD AND HASTENED TO TELL THE BISHOP WHAT THEY HAD FOUND HE BEING THEN ALONE IN A PLACE REMOTE FROM THE CHURCH
7558-89894-0034 AND ENCOMPASSED ON ALL SIDES BY THE SHIFTING WAVES OF THE SEA THERE HE ALWAYS USED TO SPEND THE TIME OF LENT AND WAS WONT TO PASS THE FORTY DAYS BEFORE THE NATIVITY OF OUR LORD IN GREAT DEVOTION WITH ABSTINENCE AND PRAYER AND TEARS
7558-89894-0035 THERE ALSO HIS VENERABLE PREDECESSOR CUTHBERT HAD FOR SOME TIME SERVED AS THE SOLDIER OF THE LORD IN SOLITUDE
7558-89894-0036 THEY BROUGHT HIM ALSO SOME PART OF THE GARMENTS THAT HAD COVERED THE HOLY BODY WHICH PRESENTS HE THANKFULLY ACCEPTED AND GLADLY HEARD OF THE MIRACLES
7558-89894-0037 LET NEW GARMENTS BE PUT UPON THE BODY IN PLACE OF THESE YOU HAVE BROUGHT AND SO LAY IT IN THE COFFIN WHICH YOU HAVE PREPARED FOR I KNOW OF A SURETY THAT THE PLACE WILL NOT LONG REMAIN EMPTY WHICH HAS BEEN HALLOWED WITH SO GREAT GRACE OF HEAVENLY MIRACLES
7558-89894-0038 AND HOW HAPPY IS HE TO WHOM THE LORD THE AUTHOR AND GIVER OF ALL BLISS SHALL VOUCHSAFE TO GRANT THE PRIVILEGE OF RESTING THEREIN
7558-89894-0039 WHEN THE BISHOP HAD MADE AN END OF SAYING THIS AND MORE IN LIKE MANNER WITH MANY TEARS AND GREAT COMPUNCTION AND WITH FALTERING TONGUE THE BROTHERS DID AS HE HAD COMMANDED THEM AND WHEN THEY HAD WRAPPED THE BODY IN NEW GARMENTS AND LAID IT IN A NEW COFFIN
7558-89894-0040 OF SOME OF THESE WE HAVE BEFORE PRESERVED THE MEMORY IN THE BOOK OF HIS LIFE BUT IN THIS HISTORY WE HAVE THOUGHT FIT TO ADD SOME OTHERS WHICH HAVE LATELY COME TO OUR KNOWLEDGE
7558-89894-0041 THERE WAS IN THAT SAME MONASTERY A BROTHER WHOSE NAME WAS BADUDEGN WHO HAD FOR NO SMALL TIME MINISTERED TO THE GUESTS OF THE HOUSE
7558-89894-0042 AND IS STILL LIVING HAVING THE TESTIMONY OF ALL THE BROTHERS AND STRANGERS RESORTING THITHER OF BEING A MAN OF MUCH PIETY AND RELIGION AND SERVING THE OFFICE PUT UPON HIM ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF THE HEAVENLY REWARD
7558-89894-0043 THIS MAN HAVING ONE DAY WASHED IN THE SEA THE COVERINGS OR BLANKETS WHICH HE USED IN THE GUEST CHAMBER WAS RETURNING HOME WHEN ON THE WAY HE WAS SEIZED WITH A SUDDEN INFIRMITY
7558-89894-0044 AND COULD SCARCE AT LAST RISE AGAIN WHEN HE GOT UP HE FELT ONE HALF OF HIS BODY FROM THE HEAD TO THE FOOT STRUCK WITH PALSY AND WITH GREAT TROUBLE MADE HIS WAY HOME BY THE HELP OF A STAFF
7558-89894-0045 THE DISEASE INCREASED BY DEGREES AND AS NIGHT APPROACHED BECAME STILL WORSE SO THAT WHEN DAY RETURNED HE COULD SCARCELY RISE OR WALK ALONE SUFFERING FROM THIS TROUBLE HE CONCEIVED THE WISE RESOLVE TO GO TO THE CHURCH AS BEST HE COULD
7558-89894-0046 AND APPROACH THE TOMB OF THE REVEREND FATHER CUTHBERT AND THERE ON HIS KNEES HUMBLY BESEECH THE MERCY OF GOD THAT HE MIGHT EITHER BE DELIVERED FROM THAT DISEASE IF IT WERE WELL FOR HIM OR IF BY THE GRACE OF GOD IT WAS ORDAINED FOR HIM TO BE CHASTENED LONGER BY THIS AFFLICTION
7558-89894-0047 THAT HE MIGHT BEAR THE PAIN WHICH WAS LAID UPON HIM WITH PATIENCE AND A QUIET MIND HE DID ACCORDINGLY AS HE HAD DETERMINED AND SUPPORTING HIS WEAK LIMBS WITH A STAFF ENTERED THE CHURCH
7558-89894-0048 THERE PROSTRATING HIMSELF BEFORE THE BODY OF THE MAN OF GOD HE PRAYED WITH PIOUS EARNESTNESS THAT THROUGH HIS INTERCESSION THE LORD MIGHT BE PROPITIOUS TO HIM AS HE PRAYED HE SEEMED TO FALL INTO A DEEP SLEEP AND
7558-89894-0049 AS HE WAS AFTERWARDS WONT TO RELATE FELT A LARGE AND BROAD HAND TOUCH HIS HEAD WHERE THE PAIN LAY AND LIKEWISE PASS OVER ALL THAT PART OF HIS BODY WHICH HAD BEEN BENUMBED BY THE DISEASE
7558-89894-0050 BUT RATHER IT GREW DAILY WORSE ON A SUDDEN THROUGH THE GRACE OF THE MERCY OF GOD IT CAME TO PASS THAT HE WAS CURED BY THE RELICS OF THE HOLY FATHER CUTHBERT FOR WHEN THE BRETHREN FOUND HIS BODY UNCORRUPTED AFTER HAVING BEEN MANY YEARS BURIED
7558-89894-0051 THEY TOOK SOME PART OF THE HAIR TO GIVE AS RELICS TO FRIENDS WHO ASKED FOR THEM OR TO SHOW IN TESTIMONY OF THE MIRACLE ONE OF THE PRIESTS OF THE MONASTERY NAMED THRUIDRED WHO IS NOW ABBOT THERE HAD A SMALL PART OF THESE RELICS BY HIM AT THAT TIME
7558-89894-0052 ONE DAY HE WENT INTO THE CHURCH AND OPENED THE BOX OF RELICS TO GIVE SOME PART OF THEM TO A FRIEND WHO ASKED FOR IT AND IT HAPPENED THAT THE YOUTH WHO HAD THE DISEASED EYE WAS THEN IN THE CHURCH
