753-32846-0002 THE ROBINS WHICH THOUGH NOT SO WELL ADVERTISED RISE JUST AS PUNCTUALLY AS THE LARK WERE BEGINNING TO SING AS THEY MADE THEIR SIMPLE TOILETS BEFORE SETTING OUT TO ATTEND TO THE EARLY WORM
753-32846-0003 THE SKY TO THE EAST WAS A DELICATE BLEND OF PINKS AND GREENS AND YELLOWS WITH A HINT OF BLUE BEHIND THE GREY WHICH WAS STILL THE PREVAILING NOTE A VAGUELY SENTIMENTAL MOOD CAME UPON STEVE
753-32846-0004 IN HIS HEART HE KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT HE COULD NEVER BE HAPPY FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME OUT OF SIGHT AND HEARING OF BROADWAY CARS BUT AT THAT MOMENT SUCH WAS THE MAGIC OF THE DAWN HE FELT A LONGING TO SETTLE DOWN IN THE COUNTRY AND PASS THE REST OF HIS DAYS A SIMPLE FARMER
753-32846-0005 WITH BEARD UNCHECKED BY RAZOR
753-32846-0006 WHILE MAMIE IN A COTTON FROCK CALLED CHEERFULLY TO HIM TO COME IN BECAUSE BREAKFAST WAS READY AND GETTING COLD MAMIE AH HIS SIGH TURNED INTO A YAWN
753-32846-0007 HE REALIZED WITH THE ABRUPTNESS WHICH COMES TO A MAN WHO STANDS ALONE WITH NATURE IN THE SMALL HOURS THAT HE WAS VERY SLEEPY THE EXCITEMENT WHICH HAD SUSTAINED HIM TILL NOW HAD BEGUN TO EBB THE FREE LIFE OF THE BEARDED FARMER
753-32846-0008 SEEMED SUDDENLY LESS ATTRACTIVE BED WAS WHAT HE WANTED NOW NOT NATURE
753-32846-0009 THE WHITE HOPE GURGLED DROWSILY BUT DID NOT WAKE STEVE CARRIED HIM ON TO THE PORCH AND LAID HIM DOWN THEN HE TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEM OF EFFECTING AN ENTRY ONCE AN HONEST MAN HAS TAKEN TO AMATEUR BURGLING HE SOON PICKS UP THE TRICKS OF IT
