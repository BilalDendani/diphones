4659-12464-0000 NOR DID THEY RETAIN WHAT THEY HAD BEFORE BUT ESAU DEPARTED FROM THE CITY OF HEBRON AND LEFT IT TO HIS BROTHER AND DWELT IN SEIR AND RULED OVER IDUMEA HE CALLED THE COUNTRY BY THAT NAME FROM HIMSELF
4659-12464-0001 WHICH APPELLATION HE GOT ON THE FOLLOWING OCCASION ONE DAY RETURNING FROM THE TOIL OF HUNTING VERY HUNGRY IT WAS WHEN HE WAS A CHILD IN AGE HE LIGHTED ON HIS BROTHER WHEN HE WAS GETTING READY LENTILE POTTAGE FOR HIS DINNER WHICH WAS OF A VERY RED COLOR
4659-12464-0002 ON WHICH ACCOUNT HE THE MORE EARNESTLY LONGED FOR IT AND DESIRED HIM TO GIVE HIM SOME OF IT TO EAT BUT HE MADE ADVANTAGE OF HIS BROTHER'S HUNGER AND FORCED HIM TO RESIGN UP TO HIM HIS BIRTHRIGHT AND HE BEING PINCHED WITH FAMINE
4659-12464-0003 WERE BY ONE WIFE WHOSE NAME WAS ALIBAMA BUT OF THE REST ALIPHAZ WAS BORN TO HIM BY ADA
4659-12464-0004 THESE DWELT IN THAT PART OF IDUMEA WHICH IS CALLED GEBALITIS AND THAT DENOMINATED FROM AMALEK AMALEKITIS FOR IDUMEA WAS A LARGE COUNTRY AND DID THEN PRESERVE THE NAME OF THE WHOLE
4659-12464-0005 WHILE IN ITS SEVERAL PARTS IT KEPT THE NAMES OF ITS PECULIAR INHABITANTS CHAPTER TWO HOW JOSEPH THE YOUNGEST OF JACOB'S SONS WAS ENVIED BY HIS BRETHREN
4659-12464-0006 AND SHREWD ALSO IN UNDERSTANDING AND GOD EXERCISED SUCH A PROVIDENCE OVER HIM AND SUCH A CARE OF HIS HAPPINESS AS TO BRING HIM THE GREATEST BLESSINGS EVEN OUT OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE MOST SORROWFUL CONDITION
4659-12464-0007 BOTH BECAUSE OF THE BEAUTY OF HIS BODY AND THE VIRTUES OF HIS MIND FOR HE EXCELLED THE REST IN PRUDENCE THIS AFFECTION OF HIS FATHER EXCITED THE ENVY AND THE HATRED OF HIS BRETHREN
4659-12464-0008 AS DID ALSO HIS DREAMS WHICH HE SAW AND RELATED TO HIS FATHER AND TO THEM WHICH FORETOLD HIS FUTURE HAPPINESS IT BEING USUAL WITH MANKIND TO ENVY THEIR VERY NEAREST RELATIONS SUCH THEIR PROSPERITY
4659-12464-0009 HE SAW A VISION IN A DREAM BUT GREATLY EXCEEDING THE CUSTOMARY APPEARANCES THAT COME WHEN WE ARE ASLEEP WHICH WHEN HE WAS GOT UP HE TOLD HIS BRETHREN THAT THEY MIGHT JUDGE WHAT IT PORTENDED HE SAID HE SAW THE LAST NIGHT
4659-12464-0010 THAT HIS WHEAT SHEAF STOOD STILL IN THE PLACE WHERE HE SET IT BUT THAT THEIR SHEAVES RAN TO BOW DOWN TO IT AS SERVANTS BOW DOWN TO THEIR MASTERS BUT AS SOON AS THEY PERCEIVED THE VISION FORETOLD THAT HE SHOULD OBTAIN POWER AND GREAT WEALTH
4659-12464-0011 WHICH WAS MUCH MORE WONDERFUL THAN THE FORMER FOR IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE SUN TOOK WITH HIM THE MOON AND THE REST OF THE STARS AND CAME DOWN TO THE EARTH AND BOWED DOWN TO HIM HE TOLD THE VISION TO HIS FATHER AND THAT AS SUSPECTING NOTHING OF ILL WILL FROM HIS BRETHREN
4659-12464-0012 WHEN THEY WERE THERE ALSO AND DESIRED HIM TO INTERPRET WHAT IT SHOULD SIGNIFY NOW JACOB WAS PLEASED WITH THE DREAM FOR CONSIDERING THE PREDICTION IN HIS MIND AND SHREWDLY AND WISELY GUESSING AT ITS MEANING
4659-12464-0013 AS GUESSING THAT THE MOON AND SUN WERE LIKE HIS MOTHER AND FATHER THE FORMER AS SHE THAT GAVE INCREASE AND NOURISHMENT TO ALL THINGS AND THE LATTER HE THAT GAVE FORM AND OTHER POWERS TO THEM AND THAT THE STARS WERE LIKE HIS BRETHREN SINCE THEY WERE ELEVEN IN NUMBER
4659-12464-0014 THAT WAS TO THOSE GOOD THINGS WHICH WERE SIGNIFIED BY THE DREAMS AND NOT AS ONE THAT WAS A BROTHER WITH WHOM IT WAS PROBABLE THEY SHOULD BE JOINT PARTAKERS AND AS THEY HAD BEEN PARTNERS IN THE SAME PARENTAGE
4659-12464-0015 AND FOR PASTURAGE THERE THEY FED THEIR FLOCKS WITHOUT ACQUAINTING THEIR FATHER WITH THEIR REMOVAL THITHER WHEREUPON HE HAD MELANCHOLY SUSPICIONS ABOUT THEM AS BEING IGNORANT OF HIS SONS CONDITION
4659-12464-0016 AND RECEIVING NO MESSENGER FROM THE FLOCKS THAT COULD INFORM HIM OF THE TRUE STATE THEY WERE IN SO BECAUSE HE WAS IN GREAT FEAR ABOUT THEM HE SENT JOSEPH TO THE FLOCKS TO LEARN THE CIRCUMSTANCES HIS BRETHREN WERE IN AND TO BRING HIM WORD HOW THEY DID
4659-12464-0017 CHAPTER THREE
4659-12464-0018 BY REASON OF THEIR HATRED TO HIM
4659-12464-0019 BY WHICH ACT THE FATHER MUST BE TREATED UNJUSTLY IN THE SON'S SLAUGHTER
4659-12464-0020 AND THIS NOT IN A NATURAL WAY NEITHER SO HE ENTREATED THEM TO HAVE A REGARD TO THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES AND WISELY TO CONSIDER WHAT MISCHIEF WOULD BETIDE THEM UPON THE DEATH OF SO GOOD A CHILD AND THEIR YOUNGEST BROTHER
4659-12464-0021 AND YIELDED TO REPENTANCE AND AMENDMENT BUT IN CASE THEY PROCEEDED TO DO THE FACT ALL SORTS OF PUNISHMENTS WOULD OVERTAKE THEM FROM GOD FOR THIS MURDER OF THEIR BROTHER SINCE THEY POLLUTED HIS PROVIDENCE WHICH WAS EVERY WHERE PRESENT AND WHICH
4659-12464-0022 WHICH THEY CAN NEVER AVOID WHETHER IT BE A GOOD CONSCIENCE OR WHETHER IT BE SUCH A ONE AS THEY WILL HAVE WITHIN THEM WHEN ONCE THEY HAVE KILLED THEIR BROTHER HE ALSO ADDED THIS BESIDES TO WHAT HE HAD BEFORE SAID THAT IT WAS NOT A RIGHTEOUS THING TO KILL A BROTHER
4659-12464-0023 THOUGH HE HAD INJURED THEM THAT IT IS A GOOD THING TO FORGET THE ACTIONS OF SUCH NEAR FRIENDS EVEN IN THINGS WHEREIN THEY MIGHT SEEM TO HAVE OFFENDED BUT THAT THEY WERE GOING TO KILL JOSEPH WHO HAD BEEN GUILTY OF NOTHING THAT WAS ILL TOWARDS THEM
4659-12464-0024 IN WHOSE CASE THE INFIRMITY OF HIS SMALL AGE SHOULD RATHER PROCURE HIM MERCY AND MOVE THEM TO UNITE TOGETHER IN THE CARE OF HIS PRESERVATION
4659-12464-0025 IF THEY SLEW HIM WHO WAS JUDGED BY GOD TO BE WORTHY OF THAT PROSPERITY WHICH WAS TO BE HOPED FOR
4659-12464-0026 AND USED ENTREATIES TO THEM AND THEREBY ENDEAVORED TO DIVERT THEM FROM THE MURDER OF THEIR BROTHER BUT WHEN HE SAW THAT HIS DISCOURSE HAD NOT MOLLIFIED THEM AT ALL AND THAT THEY MADE HASTE TO DO THE FACT
4659-12464-0027 HE ADVISED THEM TO ALLEVIATE THE WICKEDNESS THEY WERE GOING ABOUT IN THE MANNER OF TAKING JOSEPH OFF FOR AS HE HAD EXHORTED THEM FIRST WHEN THEY WERE GOING TO REVENGE THEMSELVES TO BE DISSUADED FROM DOING IT
4659-12464-0028 AFTER RUBEL WAS GONE ADVISED HIS BRETHREN TO DRAW JOSEPH OUT OF THE PIT AND SELL HIM TO THE ARABIANS FOR IF HE SHOULD DIE AMONG STRANGERS A GREAT WAY OFF
4659-12464-0029 BUT REUBEL COMING IN THE NIGHT TIME TO THE PIT RESOLVED TO SAVE JOSEPH WITHOUT THE PRIVITY OF HIS BRETHREN AND WHEN UPON HIS CALLING TO HIM HE MADE NO ANSWER HE WAS AFRAID THAT THEY HAD DESTROYED HIM AFTER HE WAS GONE OF WHICH HE COMPLAINED TO HIS BRETHREN
4659-12464-0030 BUT WHEN THEY HAD TOLD HIM WHAT THEY HAD DONE
4659-12464-0031 THEY CONSIDERED WHAT THEY SHOULD DO TO ESCAPE THE SUSPICIONS OF THEIR FATHER
4659-12464-0032 SO THEY THOUGHT PROPER TO TEAR THAT COAT TO PIECES AND TO DIP IT INTO GOATS BLOOD AND THEN TO CARRY IT AND SHOW IT TO THEIR FATHER THAT HE MIGHT BELIEVE HE WAS DESTROYED BY WILD BEASTS AND WHEN THEY HAD SO DONE THEY CAME TO THE OLD MAN
4659-12464-0033 BUT THIS NOT TILL WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIS SON HAD ALREADY COME TO HIS KNOWLEDGE THEN THEY SAID THAT THEY HAD NOT SEEN JOSEPH NOR KNEW WHAT MISHAP HAD BEFALLEN HIM BUT THAT THEY HAD FOUND HIS COAT BLOODY AND TORN TO PIECES WHENCE THEY HAD A SUSPICION THAT HE HAD FALLEN AMONG WILD BEASTS
4659-12464-0034 AND SO PERISHED IF THAT WAS THE COAT HE HAD ON WHEN HE CAME FROM HOME NOW JACOB HAD BEFORE SOME BETTER HOPES THAT HIS SON WAS ONLY MADE A CAPTIVE BUT NOW HE LAID ASIDE THAT NOTION
4659-12464-0035 AND SUPPOSED THAT THIS COAT WAS AN EVIDENT ARGUMENT THAT HE WAS DEAD FOR HE WELL REMEMBERED THAT THIS WAS THE COAT HE HAD ON WHEN HE SENT HIM TO HIS BRETHREN SO HE HEREAFTER LAMENTED THE LAD AS NOW DEAD AND AS IF HE HAD BEEN THE FATHER OF NO MORE THAN ONE
4659-12464-0036 WITHOUT TAKING ANY COMFORT IN THE REST AND SO HE WAS ALSO AFFECTED WITH HIS MISFORTUNE BEFORE HE MET WITH JOSEPH'S BRETHREN WHEN HE ALSO CONJECTURED THAT JOSEPH WAS DESTROYED BY WILD BEASTS
