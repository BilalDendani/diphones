3346-158751-0000 UPON THE WHOLE AVERSE TO MATRIMONY SHE HAD TOLD MISS MACNULTY OF HER PROSPECTS
3346-158751-0001 AND THE POOR DEPENDANT THOUGH SHE KNEW THAT SHE MUST BE TURNED OUT INTO THE STREET HAD CONGRATULATED HER PATRONESS THE VULTURESS WILL
3346-158751-0002 GO LIZZIE HAD SAID DISPLAYING INDEED SOME ACCURATE DISCERNMENT OF HER AUNT'S CHARACTER BUT AFTER LADY FAWN'S VISIT SHE SPOKE OF THE MARRIAGE IN A DIFFERENT TONE OF COURSE MY DEAR I SHALL HAVE TO LOOK
3346-158751-0003 I SUPPOSE THE LAWYERS WILL DO THAT SAID MISS MACNULTY YES LAWYERS THAT'S ALL VERY WELL I KNOW WHAT LAWYERS ARE
3346-158751-0004 ANY LAWYER TO GIVE AWAY MY PROPERTY OF COURSE WE SHALL LIVE AT PORTRAY BECAUSE HIS PLACE IS IN IRELAND AND NOTHING SHALL TAKE ME TO IRELAND I TOLD HIM THAT FROM THE VERY FIRST BUT I DON'T MEAN TO GIVE UP MY OWN INCOME
3346-158751-0005 IT MAY SEEM UNJUST TO ACCUSE HER OF BEING STUPIDLY UNACQUAINTED WITH CIRCUMSTANCES AND A LIAR AT THE SAME TIME BUT SHE WAS BOTH
3346-158751-0006 AND MISS MACNULTY DID NOT COMPREHEND THE DEPTH OF THE IGNORANCE OF HER PATRONESS THUS THE LIES WHICH LIZZIE TOLD WERE AMAZING TO MISS MACNULTY TO SAY THAT LORD FAWN WAS IN THE CABINET WHEN
3346-158751-0007 ALL THE WORLD KNEW THAT HE WAS AN UNDER SECRETARY WHAT
3346-158751-0008 LORD FAWN WAS A LORD AND EVEN COMMONERS WERE IN THE CABINET OF COURSE HE IS SAID LIZZIE BUT I SHA'N'T HAVE MY DRAWING ROOM MADE A CABINET THEY SHA'N'T COME HERE AND THEN AGAIN ON THE TUESDAY EVENING
3346-158751-0009 SHE DISPLAYED HER INDEPENDENCE AS FOR THOSE WOMEN DOWN AT RICHMOND I DON'T MEAN TO BE OVERRUN BY THEM I CAN TELL YOU I SAID I WOULD GO THERE AND OF COURSE I SHALL KEEP MY WORD
3346-158751-0010 I THINK YOU HAD BETTER GO SAID MISS MACNULTY OF COURSE I SHALL GO
3346-158751-0011 AND WHERE I'M NOT BUT IT'LL BE ABOUT THE FIRST AND THE LAST VISIT AND AS FOR BRINGING THOSE DOWDY GIRLS OUT IN LONDON IT'S THE LAST THING I SHALL THINK OF DOING INDEED I DOUBT WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD TO DRESS THEMSELVES
3346-158751-0012 DISLIKE TO EVERYTHING APPERTAINING TO THE FAWN FAMILY SHE HAD EVEN RIDICULED LORD FAWN HIMSELF DECLARING THAT HE UNDERSTOOD NOTHING ABOUT ANYTHING BEYOND HIS OFFICE AND IN TRUTH
3346-158751-0013 LIZZIE ALMOST HAD MADE UP HER MIND TO BREAK IT OFF ALL THAT SHE WOULD GAIN DID NOT SEEM TO WEIGH DOWN WITH SUFFICIENT PREPONDERANCE ALL THAT SHE WOULD LOSE SUCH WERE HER FEELINGS ON THE TUESDAY NIGHT BUT ON THE WEDNESDAY MORNING
3346-158751-0014 WHICH THREW HER BACK VIOLENTLY UPON THE FAWN INTEREST THE NOTE WAS AS FOLLOWS
3346-158751-0015 THEY HAVE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS TO PROCEED BY LAW FOR THE RECOVERY OF THE EUSTACE DIAMONDS NOW IN LADY EUSTACE'S HANDS AND WILL FEEL OBLIGED TO LADY EUSTACE IF SHE WILL COMMUNICATE TO THEM
3346-158751-0016 THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF HER ATTORNEY SIXTY TWO NEW SQUARE
3346-158751-0017 EFFECT OF THIS NOTE WAS TO DRIVE LIZZIE BACK UPON THE FAWN INTEREST SHE WAS FRIGHTENED ABOUT THE DIAMONDS AND WAS NEVERTHELESS ALMOST DETERMINED NOT TO SURRENDER THEM AT ANY RATE
3346-158751-0018 IN SUCH A STRAIT SHE WOULD WANT ASSISTANCE EITHER IN KEEPING THEM OR IN GIVING THEM UP THE LAWYER'S LETTER AFFLICTED HER WITH A SENSE OF WEAKNESS
3346-158751-0019 AS LORD FAWN WAS SO POOR PERHAPS HE WOULD ADHERE TO THE JEWELS SHE KNEW THAT SHE COULD NOT FIGHT MISTER CAMPERDOWN WITH NO OTHER ASSISTANCE THAN WHAT
3346-158751-0020 AND THEREFORE HER HEART SOFTENED TOWARDS HER BETROTHED I SUPPOSE FREDERIC WILL BE HERE TO DAY SHE SAID TO MISS MACNULTY AS THEY SAT AT BREAKFAST TOGETHER ABOUT NOON MISS MACNULTY NODDED
3346-158751-0021 YOU CAN HAVE A CAB YOU KNOW IF YOU LIKE TO GO ANYWHERE MISS MACNULTY SAID SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD GO TO THE NATIONAL GALLERY AND YOU CAN WALK BACK YOU KNOW SAID LIZZIE I CAN WALK THERE
3346-158751-0022 SO THAT SHE MIGHT PUT HER HAND UPON IT AT ONCE
3346-158751-0023 FREDERIC SAT HIMSELF BESIDE HER AND THE INTERCOURSE FOR AWHILE WAS SUCH AS MIGHT BE LOOKED FOR BETWEEN TWO LOVERS OF WHOM ONE WAS A WIDOW
3346-158751-0024 TALKING CHIEFLY OF THINGS MATERIAL EACH FLATTERING THE OTHER AND EACH HINTING NOW AND AGAIN AT CERTAIN LITTLE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH A MORE ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE SEEMED TO BE DESIRABLE
3346-158751-0025 THE ONE WAS CONVERSANT WITH THINGS IN GENERAL BUT WAS SLOW THE OTHER WAS QUICK AS A LIZARD IN TURNING HITHER AND THITHER BUT KNEW ALMOST NOTHING
3346-158751-0026 HER OWN TO DO WHAT SHE LIKED WITH SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT HE WOULD CERTAINLY FIND OUT THE TRUTH FROM OTHER SOURCES BEFORE HE MARRIED HER INDEED SHE WAS NOT QUITE SURE HERSELF
3346-158751-0027 WHETHER THE STATEMENT WAS TRUE OR FALSE THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE MADE IT SO FREQUENTLY HAD HER IDEA OF THE TRUTH BEEN A FIXED IDEA IT HAD ALL BEEN EXPLAINED TO HER
3346-158751-0028 BUT THERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING ABOUT A SECOND SON AND THERE WAS NO SECOND SON PERHAPS SHE MIGHT HAVE A SECOND SON YET A FUTURE LITTLE LORD FAWN AND HE MIGHT INHERIT IT IN REGARD TO HONESTY
3346-158751-0029 THE MAN WAS SUPERIOR TO THE WOMAN BECAUSE HIS PURPOSE WAS DECLARED AND HE TOLD NO LIES BUT THE ONE WAS AS MERCENARY AS THE OTHER IT WAS NOT LOVE THAT HAD BROUGHT LORD FAWN TO MOUNT STREET
3346-158751-0030 THERE IS NO HOUSE YOU KNOW BUT THERE WAS ONE FREDERIC THE TOWN LAND WHERE THE HOUSE USED TO BE IS CALLED KILLEAGENT
3346-158751-0031 AND AND DOES IT GO A GREAT MANY MILES LORD FAWN EXPLAINED THAT IT DID RUN A GOOD MANY MILES UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS HOW BEAUTIFULLY ROMANTIC SAID LIZZIE BUT THE PEOPLE LIVE ON THE MOUNTAIN
3346-158751-0032 BUT HE DID INQUIRE WHO WAS LIZZIE'S SOLICITOR OF COURSE THERE WILL BE THINGS TO BE SETTLED HE SAID AND MY LAWYER HAD BETTER SEE YOURS MISTER CAMPERDOWN IS A MISTER CAMPERDOWN
3346-158751-0033 ALMOST SHRIEKED LIZZIE LORD FAWN THEN EXPLAINED WITH SOME AMAZEMENT THAT MISTER CAMPERDOWN WAS HIS LAWYER AS FAR AS HIS BELIEF WENT
3346-158751-0034 HAD ANY OBJECTION TO MISTER CAMPERDOWN MISTER CAMPERDOWN WAS SIR FLORIAN'S LAWYER SAID LIZZIE THAT WILL MAKE IT ALL THE EASIER I SHOULD THINK SAID LORD FAWN I
3346-158751-0035 DON'T KNOW HOW THAT MAY BE SAID LIZZIE TRYING TO BRING HER MIND TO WORK UPON THE SUBJECT STEADILY MISTER CAMPERDOWN HAS BEEN VERY UNCOURTEOUS TO ME I MUST SAY THAT AND AS I THINK UNFAIR
3346-158751-0036 HE WISHES TO ROB ME NOW OF A THING THAT IS QUITE MY OWN WHAT SORT OF A THING ASKED LORD FAWN SLOWLY A VERY VALUABLE THING I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT FREDERIC OF COURSE
3346-158751-0037 I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING NOW I NEVER COULD KEEP BACK ANYTHING FROM ONE THAT I LOVED IT'S NOT MY NATURE THERE YOU MIGHT AS WELL READ THAT NOTE THEN SHE PUT HER HAND BACK AND BROUGHT MISTER CAMPERDOWN'S LETTER FROM UNDER THE BIBLE
3346-158751-0038 IN THE DISCRETION AND HONESTY OF HIS OWN FAMILY LAWYER WHAT HIS LAWYER TELLS HIM TO DO HE DOES WHAT HIS LAWYER TELLS HIM TO SIGN HE SIGNS
3346-158751-0039 ALTOGETHER MY OWN SIR FLORIAN GAVE THEM TO ME WHEN HE PUT THEM INTO MY HANDS HE SAID THAT THEY WERE TO BE MY OWN FOR EVER AND EVER THERE SAID HE
3346-158751-0040 TO DO WHAT YOU CHOOSE WITH THEM AFTER THAT
3346-158751-0041 OUGHT THEY IF YOU HAD BEEN MARRIED BEFORE AND YOUR WIFE HAD GIVEN YOU A KEEPSAKE TO KEEP FOR EVER AND EVER WOULD YOU GIVE IT UP TO A LAWYER YOU WOULD NOT LIKE IT WOULD YOU FREDERIC SHE HAD PUT HER HAND ON HIS
3346-158751-0042 AGAIN PERHAPS THE ACTING WAS A LITTLE OVERDONE
3346-158751-0043 DIAMONDS FAMILY DIAMONDS SAID LORD FAWN WHAT DO THEY CONSIST OF WHAT ARE THEY WORTH I'LL SHOW THEM TO YOU SAID LIZZIE JUMPING UP
3346-158751-0044 TO DEMAND FROM HER THE SURRENDER OF ANY TRINKET WHICH HER LATE HUSBAND
3346-158751-0045 IN THE MANNER SHE HAD DESCRIBED BUT IT WAS TO HIS THINKING MOST IMPROBABLE THAT THE EUSTACE PEOPLE OR THE LAWYER SHOULD BE HARSH TO A WIDOW BEARING THE EUSTACE NAME THE EUSTACES WERE
3346-158751-0046 BY DISPOSITION LAVISH AND OLD MISTER CAMPERDOWN WAS NOT ONE WHO WOULD BE STRICT IN CLAIMING LITTLE THINGS FOR RICH CLIENTS AND YET HERE WAS HIS LETTER THREATENING THE WIDOW OF THE LATE BARONET WITH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
3346-158751-0047 FOR THE RECOVERY OF JEWELS WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN BY SIR FLORIAN HIMSELF TO HIS WIFE AS A KEEPSAKE PERHAPS SIR FLORIAN HAD MADE SOME MISTAKE
3346-158751-0048 SOME JEWEL WHICH HE HAD THOUGHT TO BE HIS OWN BUT WHICH HAD IN TRUTH BEEN AN HEIRLOOM IF SO THE JEWEL SHOULD OF COURSE BE SURRENDERED OR REPLACED BY ONE OF EQUAL VALUE HE WAS MAKING OUT SOME SUCH SOLUTION
3346-158751-0049 WHEN LIZZIE RETURNED WITH THE MOROCCO CASE IN HER HAND IT WAS THE MANNER IN WHICH HE GAVE IT TO ME SAID LIZZIE AS SHE OPENED THE CLASP WHICH MAKES ITS VALUE TO ME LORD FAWN
3346-158751-0050 KNEW NOTHING ABOUT JEWELS BUT EVEN HE KNEW THAT IF THE CIRCLE OF STONES WHICH HE SAW WITH A MALTESE CROSS APPENDED TO IT WAS CONSTITUTED OF REAL DIAMONDS THE THING MUST BE OF GREAT VALUE
3346-158751-0051 THAT SUCH A NECKLACE IS NOT GIVEN BY A HUSBAND EVEN TO A BRIDE
3346-158751-0052 OR BROOCH OR PERHAPS A BRACELET A LOVER OR A LOVING LORD MAY BRING IN HIS POCKET BUT SUCH AN ORNAMENT AS THIS ON WHICH LORD FAWN WAS NOW LOOKING IS GIVEN IN ANOTHER SORT OF WAY HE FELT SURE
3346-158751-0053 THAT IT WAS SO EVEN THOUGH HE WAS ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE VALUE OF THE STONES DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS WORTH HE ASKED LIZZIE
3346-158751-0054 AND THEN REMEMBERED THAT FREDERIC IN HIS PRESENT POSITION IN REGARD TO HERSELF MIGHT BE GLAD TO ASSIST HER IN MAINTAINING THE POSSESSION OF A SUBSTANTIAL PROPERTY
3346-158751-0055 THOUSAND POUNDS SHE REPLIED TEN THOUSAND POUNDS LORD FAWN RIVETED HIS EYES UPON THEM THAT'S WHAT I AM TOLD BY A JEWELLER
3346-158751-0056 BY WHAT JEWELLER A MAN HAD TO COME AND SEE THEM ABOUT SOME REPAIRS OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND POOR SIR FLORIAN WISHED IT
3346-158751-0057 WHAT WAS THE MAN'S NAME I FORGET HIS NAME SAID LIZZIE WHO WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISTER BENJAMIN WOULD BE CONSIDERED RESPECTABLE TEN THOUSAND POUNDS YOU DON'T KEEP THEM IN THE HOUSE
3346-158751-0058 DO YOU I HAVE AN IRON CASE UP STAIRS FOR THEM EVER SO HEAVY AND DID SIR FLORIAN GIVE YOU THE IRON CASE LIZZIE HESITATED FOR A MOMENT YES SAID SHE THAT IS NO
3346-158751-0059 BUT HE ORDERED IT TO BE MADE AND THEN IT CAME AFTER HE WAS DEAD HE KNEW THEIR VALUE THEN OH DEAR YES THOUGH HE NEVER NAMED ANY SUM HE TOLD ME HOWEVER THAT THEY WERE VERY VERY VALUABLE
3346-158751-0060 AND ALMOST OF DISMAY AN ACTION FOR THE RECOVERY OF JEWELS BROUGHT AGAINST THE LADY WHOM HE WAS ENGAGED TO MARRY
3346-158751-0061 AND A GREEDY MAN BUT HE WOULD HAVE ABANDONED HIS OFFICIAL SALARY AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE RATHER THAN THERE SHOULD HAVE FALLEN ON HIM A BREATH OF PUBLIC OPINION HINTING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE ABANDONED
3346-158751-0062 HE WAS ESPECIALLY TIMID AND LIVED IN A PERPETUAL FEAR LEST THE NEWSPAPERS SHOULD SAY SOMETHING HARD OF HIM
3346-158751-0063 HE HAD BEEN VERY WRETCHED BECAUSE FRANK GREYSTOCK HAD ACCUSED HIM OF BEING AN ADMINISTRATOR OF TYRANNY HE WOULD HAVE LIKED HIS WIFE TO HAVE TEN THOUSAND POUNDS WORTH OF DIAMONDS VERY WELL
3346-158751-0064 AND WITHOUT A WIFE'S FORTUNE
3346-158751-0065 I THINK SAID HE AT LAST THAT
3346-158751-0066 AND THEN LET THE MATTER BE SETTLED BY ARBITRATION
3346-158751-0067 THAT MEANS GOING TO LAW NO DEAREST THAT MEANS NOT GOING TO LAW THE DIAMONDS WOULD BE ENTRUSTED TO MISTER CAMPERDOWN AND THEN SOME ONE WOULD BE APPOINTED TO DECIDE WHOSE PROPERTY THEY WERE
3346-158751-0068 BUT HE SAYS THEY BELONG TO THE FAMILY HE'LL SAY ANYTHING SAID LIZZIE MY DEAREST GIRL THERE CAN'T BE A MORE RESPECTABLE MAN THAN MISTER CAMPERDOWN YOU MUST DO SOMETHING OF THE KIND YOU KNOW
3346-158751-0069 I SHA'N'T DO ANYTHING OF THE KIND SAID LIZZIE SIR FLORIAN EUSTACE GAVE THEM TO ME AND I SHALL KEEP THEM SHE DID NOT LOOK AT HER LOVER AS SHE SPOKE
3346-158751-0070 AND DID NOT LIKE THE CHANGE WHICH HE SAW ON HER COUNTENANCE AND HE DID NOT LIKE THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF PLACED WHY SHOULD MISTER CAMPERDOWN INTERFERE CONTINUED LIZZIE IF THEY DON'T BELONG TO ME THEY BELONG TO MY SON AND
3346-158751-0071 AS I HAVE BUT THEY BELONG TO ME THEY SHOULD NOT BE KEPT IN A PRIVATE HOUSE LIKE THIS AT ALL IF THEY ARE WORTH ALL THAT MONEY IF I WERE TO LET THEM GO MISTER CAMPERDOWN WOULD GET THEM
3346-158751-0072 THERE'S NOTHING HE WOULDN'T DO TO GET THEM OH FREDERIC I HOPE YOU'LL STAND TO ME AND NOT SEE ME INJURED OF COURSE I ONLY WANT THEM FOR MY DARLING CHILD FREDERIC'S FACE HAD BECOME VERY LONG
3346-158751-0073 AND HE WAS MUCH DISTURBED IN HIS MIND HE COULD ONLY SUGGEST THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD GO AND SEE MISTER CAMPERDOWN AND ASCERTAIN WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE
3346-158751-0074 HE ADHERED TO HIS ASSURANCE THAT MISTER CAMPERDOWN COULD DO NO EVIL TILL LIZZIE IN HER WRATH ASKED HIM WHETHER HE BELIEVED MISTER CAMPERDOWN'S WORD BEFORE HERS I THINK HE WOULD UNDERSTAND A MATTER OF BUSINESS
3346-158751-0075 BETTER THAN YOU SAID THE PRUDENT LOVER
3346-158751-0076 WHEN LORD FAWN TOOK HIS LEAVE
3346-158751-0077 AND AGAIN TO LEAVE THE MATTER IN MISTER CAMPERDOWN'S HANDS THE TWO WERE NOT IN GOOD ACCORD TOGETHER IT WAS HIS FIXED PURPOSE AS HE DECLARED TO HER TO SEE MISTER CAMPERDOWN AND IT WAS HER FIXED PURPOSE
3346-158751-0078 SO AT LEAST SHE DECLARED TO HIM TO KEEP THE DIAMONDS IN SPITE OF MISTER CAMPERDOWN BUT MY DEAR IF IT'S DECIDED AGAINST YOU SAID LORD FAWN GRAVELY
3346-158751-0079 THEN LIZZIE LOOKED AT HIM AND HER LOOK WHICH WAS VERY ELOQUENT CALLED HIM A POLTROON AS PLAIN AS A LOOK COULD SPEAK THEN THEY PARTED
3346-158751-0080 WERE NOT SATISFACTORY THE DOOR WAS HARDLY CLOSED BEHIND HIM BEFORE LIZZIE BEGAN TO DECLARE TO HERSELF THAT HE SHOULDN'T ESCAPE HER IT WAS NOT YET TWENTY FOUR HOURS SINCE SHE HAD BEEN TELLING HERSELF
3346-158751-0081 AND WOULD BREAK IT OFF AND NOW SHE WAS STAMPING HER LITTLE FEET AND CLENCHING HER LITTLE HANDS AND SWEARING TO HERSELF BY ALL HER GODS THAT THIS WRETCHED TIMID LORDLING SHOULD NOT GET OUT OF HER NET
3346-158751-0082 SHE DID IN TRUTH DESPISE HIM BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT CLUTCH THE JEWELS SHE LOOKED UPON HIM AS MEAN AND PALTRY BECAUSE HE WAS WILLING TO SUBMIT TO MISTER CAMPERDOWN BUT STILL SHE WAS PROMPTED TO DEMAND
3346-158751-0083 BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE PERCEIVED A SOMETHING IN HIM WHICH MIGHT PRODUCE IN HIM A DESIRE TO BE RELIEVED FROM IT NO HE SHOULD NOT BE RELIEVED HE SHOULD MARRY HER AND SHE WOULD KEEP THE KEY OF THAT IRON BOX WITH THE DIAMONDS AND
3346-158751-0084 I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT EVEN YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING AGAINST SUCH AN ALLIANCE I AM YOUR AFFECTIONATE NIECE
3346-158751-0085 THEN SHE WROTE TO MISSUS EUSTACE THE WIFE OF THE BISHOP OF BOBSBOROUGH MISSUS EUSTACE HAD BEEN VERY KIND TO HER IN THE FIRST DAYS OF HER WIDOWHOOD AND HAD FULLY RECOGNISED HER AS THE WIDOW OF THE HEAD OF HER HUSBAND'S FAMILY
3346-158751-0086 THEY WERE ACCORDING TO HER IDEAS SLOW RESPECTABLE AND DULL BUT THEY HAD NOT FOUND MUCH OPEN FAULT WITH HER AND SHE WAS AWARE THAT IT WAS FOR HER INTEREST
3346-158751-0087 HER LETTER THEREFORE TO MISSUS EUSTACE
3346-158751-0088 ACRID THAN THAT WRITTEN TO HER AUNT LINLITHGOW MY DEAR MISSUS EUSTACE I HOPE YOU WILL BE GLAD TO HEAR FROM ME AND WILL NOT BE SORRY TO HEAR MY NEWS
3346-158751-0089 I AM GOING TO BE MARRIED AGAIN OF COURSE
3346-158751-0090 WHICH IS IN EVERY WAY SO VERY IMPORTANT WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT A GREAT DEAL BUT I AM SURE
3346-158751-0091 EVERY WAY AND AS FOR MYSELF I HAVE FELT FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS HOW UNFITTED I HAVE BEEN TO MANAGE EVERYTHING MYSELF I HAVE THEREFORE ACCEPTED AN OFFER MADE TO ME
3346-158751-0092 BY LORD FAWN WHO IS AS YOU KNOW A PEER OF PARLIAMENT AND A MOST DISTINGUISHED MEMBER OF HER MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT
3346-158751-0093 AND HAS A PROPERTY IN IRELAND EXTENDING OVER EVER SO MANY MILES AND RUNNING UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS HIS MANSION THERE
3346-158751-0094 BUT I AM NOT SURE THAT I REMEMBER THE NAME QUITE RIGHTLY I HOPE I MAY SEE YOU THERE SOME DAY AND THE DEAR BISHOP I LOOK FORWARD WITH DELIGHT TO DOING SOMETHING TO MAKE THOSE DEAR IRISH HAPPIER
3346-158751-0095 THE IDEA OF RAMBLING UP INTO OUR OWN MOUNTAINS CHARMS ME FOR NOTHING SUITS MY DISPOSITION SO WELL AS THAT KIND OF SOLITUDE OF COURSE LORD FAWN IS NOT SO RICH A MAN AS SIR FLORIAN
3346-158751-0096 BUT I HAVE NEVER LOOKED TO RICHES FOR MY HAPPINESS NOT BUT WHAT LORD FAWN HAS A GOOD INCOME FROM HIS IRISH ESTATES AND THEN OF COURSE HE IS PAID FOR DOING HER MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT
3346-158751-0097 SO THERE IS NO FEAR THAT HE WILL HAVE TO LIVE UPON MY JOINTURE WHICH OF COURSE WOULD NOT BE RIGHT PRAY TELL THE DEAR BISHOP AND DEAR MARGARETTA ALL THIS WITH MY LOVE
3346-158751-0098 YOU WILL BE HAPPY I KNOW TO HEAR THAT MY LITTLE FLO IS QUITE WELL HE IS ALREADY SO FOND OF HIS NEW PAPA LIZZIE'S TURN FOR LYING WAS EXEMPLIFIED IN THIS LAST STATEMENT FOR
3346-158751-0099 THERE WERE TWO OTHER LETTERS ONE TO HER UNCLE THE DEAN AND THE OTHER TO HER COUSIN FRANK
3346-158751-0100 THE LETTER TO THE DEAN NEED NOT BE GIVEN IN FULL AS IT WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT WRITTEN TO THE BISHOP'S WIFE THE SAME MENTION WAS MADE OF HER INTENDED HUSBAND'S PEERAGE
3346-158751-0101 A PHRASE WHICH SHE HAD HEARD FROM LORD FAWN HIMSELF SHE SPOKE OF THE IRISH PROPERTY BUT IN TERMS LESS GLOWING THAN SHE HAD USED IN WRITING TO THE LADY AND ENDED BY ASKING FOR HER UNCLE'S CONGRATULATION
3346-158751-0102 AND BLESSING HER LETTER TO FRANK WAS AS FOLLOWS AND DOUBTLESS AS SHE WROTE IT THERE WAS PRESENT TO HER MIND
3346-158751-0103 MIGHT HAVE OFFERED TO HER AND HAVE HAD HER IF HE WOULD MY DEAR COUSIN AS I WOULD RATHER THAT YOU SHOULD HEAR MY NEWS FROM MYSELF THAN FROM ANY ONE ELSE I WRITE TO TELL YOU THAT
3346-158751-0104 BUT STILL I DO NOT DOUBT BUT YOU WILL THINK THAT HE IS QUITE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR POOR LITTLE COUSIN IT WAS ONLY SETTLED A DAY OR TWO SINCE BUT IT HAS BEEN COMING ON EVER SO LONG
3346-158751-0105 AND IF THE DEAN DOESN'T COME UP TO TOWN YOU MUST GIVE ME AWAY AND YOU MUST COME AND SEE ME EVER SO OFTEN FOR I HAVE A SORT OF FEELING THAT
3346-158751-0106 CALL REALLY MY OWN EXCEPT YOU AND
3346-158751-0107 MUST GIVE UP SAYING THAT HE DOESN'T DO HIS WORK PROPERLY
3346-158751-0108 EXCEPT COUSIN FRANK I AM GOING DOWN NEXT WEEK TO RICHMOND LADY FAWN HAS INSISTED ON MY STAYING THERE FOR A FORTNIGHT OH DEAR WHAT SHALL I DO ALL THE TIME
3346-158751-0109 YOU MUST POSITIVELY COME DOWN AND SEE ME AND SEE SOMEBODY ELSE TOO
3346-158751-0110 YOUR AFFECTIONATE COUSIN
3346-158751-0111 SOMEBODY IN SPEAKING ON LADY EUSTACE'S BEHALF AND MAKING THE BEST OF HER VIRTUES HAD DECLARED THAT SHE DID NOT HAVE LOVERS HITHERTO THAT HAD BEEN TRUE OF HER
3346-158751-0112 SHE WOULD BE WILLING TO SHARE EVEN THEM IT WAS BUT A DREAM BUT NEVERTHELESS IT PERVADED HER FANCY CONSTANTLY LORD FAWN PEER OF PARLIAMENT AND MEMBER OF HER MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT AS HE WAS
3346-158751-0113 IF NOTHING MORE A MUTUAL SYMPATHY WHICH SHOULD BE CHIEFLY SHOWN IN THE ABUSE OF ALL THEIR FRIENDS AND IN THIS
