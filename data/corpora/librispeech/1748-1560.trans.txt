1748-1560-0000 THE UNDULATING AND SILENT WELL AND RIPPLING RIVULET AND EVENING GLOOM NOW DEEPENING THE DARK SHADES FOR SPEECH ASSUMING HELD COMMUNE WITH HIM AS IF HE AND IT WERE ALL THAT WAS
1748-1560-0001 SHELLEY'S ALASTOR I AWOKE ONE MORNING WITH THE USUAL PERPLEXITY OF MIND WHICH ACCOMPANIES THE RETURN OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS I LAY AND LOOKED THROUGH THE EASTERN WINDOW OF MY ROOM
1748-1560-0002 A FAINT STREAK OF PEACH COLOUR DIVIDING A CLOUD THAT JUST ROSE ABOVE THE LOW SWELL OF THE HORIZON ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF THE SUN AS MY THOUGHTS WHICH A DEEP AND APPARENTLY DREAMLESS SLEEP HAD DISSOLVED BEGAN AGAIN
1748-1560-0003 TO ASSUME CRYSTALLINE FORMS THE STRANGE EVENTS OF THE FOREGOING NIGHT PRESENTED THEMSELVES ANEW TO MY WONDERING CONSCIOUSNESS THE DAY BEFORE HAD BEEN MY ONE AND TWENTIETH BIRTHDAY AMONG OTHER CEREMONIES INVESTING ME WITH MY LEGAL RIGHTS
1748-1560-0004 THE KEYS OF AN OLD SECRETARY IN WHICH MY FATHER HAD KEPT HIS PRIVATE PAPERS HAD BEEN DELIVERED UP TO ME AS SOON AS I WAS LEFT ALONE I ORDERED LIGHTS IN THE CHAMBER WHERE THE SECRETARY STOOD THE FIRST LIGHTS THAT HAD BEEN THERE FOR MANY A YEAR
1748-1560-0005 FOR SINCE MY FATHER'S DEATH THE ROOM HAD BEEN LEFT UNDISTURBED BUT AS IF THE DARKNESS HAD BEEN TOO LONG AN INMATE TO BE EASILY EXPELLED AND HAD DYED WITH BLACKNESS THE WALLS TO WHICH BAT LIKE IT HAD CLUNG
1748-1560-0006 THESE TAPERS SERVED BUT ILL TO LIGHT UP THE GLOOMY HANGINGS AND SEEMED TO THROW YET DARKER SHADOWS INTO THE HOLLOWS OF THE DEEP WROUGHT CORNICE ALL THE FURTHER PORTIONS OF THE ROOM LAY SHROUDED IN A MYSTERY
1748-1560-0007 WHOSE DEEPEST FOLDS WERE GATHERED AROUND THE DARK OAK CABINET WHICH I NOW APPROACHED WITH A STRANGE MINGLING OF REVERENCE AND CURIOSITY PERHAPS LIKE A GEOLOGIST I WAS ABOUT TO TURN UP TO THE LIGHT SOME OF THE BURIED STRATA
1748-1560-0008 OF THE HUMAN WORLD WITH ITS FOSSIL REMAINS CHARRED BY PASSION AND PETRIFIED BY TEARS PERHAPS I WAS TO LEARN HOW MY FATHER WHOSE PERSONAL HISTORY WAS UNKNOWN TO ME HAD WOVEN HIS WEB OF STORY HOW HE HAD FOUND THE WORLD
1748-1560-0009 AND HOW THE WORLD HAD LEFT HIM PERHAPS I WAS TO FIND ONLY THE RECORDS OF LANDS AND MONEYS HOW GOTTEN AND HOW SECURED COMING DOWN FROM STRANGE MEN AND THROUGH TROUBLOUS TIMES TO ME WHO KNEW LITTLE OR NOTHING OF THEM ALL
1748-1560-0010 DREW NEAR IT A HEAVY HIGH BACKED CHAIR AND SAT DOWN BEFORE A MULTITUDE OF LITTLE DRAWERS AND SLIDES AND PIGEON HOLES BUT THE DOOR OF A LITTLE CUPBOARD IN THE CENTRE ESPECIALLY ATTRACTED MY INTEREST AS IF THERE LAY THE SECRET OF THIS LONG HIDDEN WORLD
1748-1560-0011 THE OUTER ONES REACHING TO THE BACK OF THE DESK I CONCLUDED THAT THERE MUST BE SOME ACCESSIBLE SPACE BEHIND AND FOUND INDEED THAT THEY WERE FORMED IN A SEPARATE FRAMEWORK WHICH ADMITTED OF THE WHOLE BEING PULLED OUT IN ONE PIECE BEHIND
1748-1560-0012 I PRESSED THIS REPEATEDLY AND HARD WITH THE POINT OF AN OLD TOOL THAT WAS LYING NEAR TILL AT LENGTH IT YIELDED INWARDS AND THE LITTLE SLIDE FLYING UP SUDDENLY DISCLOSED A CHAMBER EMPTY
1748-1560-0013 EXCEPT THAT IN ONE CORNER LAY A LITTLE HEAP OF WITHERED ROSE LEAVES WHOSE LONG LIVED SCENT HAD LONG SINCE DEPARTED AND IN ANOTHER A SMALL PACKET OF PAPERS TIED WITH A BIT OF RIBBON
1748-1560-0014 ALMOST FEARING TO TOUCH THEM THEY WITNESSED SO MUTELY TO THE LAW OF OBLIVION I LEANED BACK IN MY CHAIR AND REGARDED THEM FOR A MOMENT WHEN SUDDENLY THERE STOOD ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE LITTLE CHAMBER AS THOUGH SHE HAD JUST EMERGED FROM ITS DEPTH
1748-1560-0015 A TINY WOMAN FORM AS PERFECT IN SHAPE AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A SMALL GREEK STATUETTE ROUSED TO LIFE AND MOTION HER DRESS WAS OF A KIND THAT COULD NEVER GROW OLD FASHIONED BECAUSE IT WAS SIMPLY NATURAL
1748-1560-0016 A ROBE PLAITED IN A BAND AROUND THE NECK AND CONFINED BY A BELT ABOUT THE WAIST DESCENDED TO HER FEET IT WAS ONLY AFTERWARDS HOWEVER THAT I TOOK NOTICE OF HER DRESS ALTHOUGH MY SURPRISE WAS BY NO MEANS OF SO OVERPOWERING A DEGREE
1748-1560-0017 AS SUCH AN APPARITION MIGHT NATURALLY BE EXPECTED TO EXCITE SEEING HOWEVER AS I SUPPOSE SOME ASTONISHMENT IN MY COUNTENANCE SHE CAME FORWARD WITHIN A YARD OF ME AND SAID IN A VOICE THAT STRANGELY RECALLED A SENSATION OF TWILIGHT
1748-1560-0018 THAT IS ALWAYS THE WAY WITH YOU MEN YOU BELIEVE NOTHING THE FIRST TIME AND IT IS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO LET MERE REPETITION CONVINCE YOU OF WHAT YOU CONSIDER IN ITSELF UNBELIEVABLE I AM NOT GOING TO ARGUE WITH YOU HOWEVER BUT TO GRANT YOU A WISH
1748-1560-0019 HERE I COULD NOT HELP INTERRUPTING HER WITH THE FOOLISH SPEECH OF WHICH HOWEVER I HAD NO CAUSE TO REPENT HOW CAN SUCH A VERY LITTLE CREATURE AS YOU GRANT OR REFUSE ANYTHING
1748-1560-0020 I SUPPOSE YOUR SIX FOOT LORDSHIP DOES NOT FEEL ALTOGETHER INSIGNIFICANT THOUGH TO OTHERS YOU DO LOOK SMALL BESIDE YOUR OLD UNCLE RALPH WHO RISES ABOVE YOU A GREAT HALF FOOT AT LEAST BUT SIZE IS OF SO LITTLE CONSEQUENCE WITH OLD ME
1748-1560-0021 AND DRAWN TOWARDS HER BY AN ATTRACTION IRRESISTIBLE AS INCOMPREHENSIBLE I SUPPOSE I STRETCHED OUT MY ARMS TOWARDS HER FOR SHE DREW BACK A STEP OR TWO AND SAID FOOLISH BOY IF YOU COULD TOUCH ME I SHOULD HURT YOU
1748-1560-0022 BESIDES I WAS TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN YEARS OLD LAST MIDSUMMER EVE AND A MAN MUST NOT FALL IN LOVE WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER YOU KNOW BUT YOU ARE NOT MY GRANDMOTHER SAID I HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT SHE RETORTED
1748-1560-0023 I DARE SAY YOU KNOW SOMETHING OF YOUR GREAT GRANDFATHERS A GOOD DEAL FURTHER BACK THAN THAT BUT YOU KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT YOUR GREAT GRANDMOTHERS ON EITHER SIDE NOW TO THE POINT
1748-1560-0024 SHE WAS WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE SAID AS SHE CLOSED THE BOOK IS THERE A FAIRY COUNTRY BROTHER YOU REPLIED WITH A SIGH I SUPPOSE THERE IS IF ONE COULD FIND THE WAY INTO IT
1748-1560-0025 I DID BUT I MEANT SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU SEEM TO THINK NEVER MIND WHAT I SEEM TO THINK YOU SHALL FIND THE WAY INTO FAIRY LAND TO MORROW NOW LOOK IN MY EYES EAGERLY I DID SO
1748-1560-0026 THEY FILLED ME WITH AN UNKNOWN LONGING I REMEMBERED SOMEHOW THAT MY MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS A BABY I LOOKED DEEPER AND DEEPER TILL THEY SPREAD AROUND ME LIKE SEAS AND I SANK IN THEIR WATERS I FORGOT ALL THE REST TILL I FOUND MYSELF AT THE WINDOW
1748-1560-0027 WHOSE GLOOMY CURTAINS WERE WITHDRAWN AND WHERE I STOOD GAZING ON A WHOLE HEAVEN OF STARS SMALL AND SPARKLING IN THE MOONLIGHT BELOW LAY A SEA STILL AS DEATH AND HOARY IN THE MOON SWEEPING INTO BAYS AND AROUND CAPES
1748-1560-0028 AND ISLANDS AWAY AWAY I KNEW NOT WHITHER ALAS IT WAS NO SEA BUT A LOW BOG BURNISHED BY THE MOON SURELY THERE IS SUCH A SEA SOMEWHERE SAID I TO MYSELF
1748-1560-0029 A LOW SWEET VOICE BESIDE ME REPLIED IN FAIRY LAND ANODOS I TURNED BUT SAW NO ONE I CLOSED THE SECRETARY AND WENT TO MY OWN ROOM AND TO BED
