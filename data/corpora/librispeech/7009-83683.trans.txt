7009-83683-0000 WITH A TESTIMONIAL OLIVER MANKELL WAS AGAIN IN THE CHARGE OF WARDER SLATER WARDER SLATER LOOKED VERY QUEER INDEED HE ACTUALLY SEEMED TO HAVE LOST IN BULK
7009-83683-0001 THE SAME PHENOMENON WAS OBSERVABLE IN THE CHIEF WARDER WHO FOLLOWED CLOSE UPON THE PRISONER'S HEELS MANKELL SEEMED AS EVER COMPLETELY AT HIS EASE
7009-83683-0002 THERE WAS AGAIN A SUSPICION OF A SMILE IN HIS EYES AND ABOUT THE CORNERS OF HIS LIPS HIS BEARING WAS IN STRIKING CONTRAST TO THAT OF THE OFFICIALS HIS SELF POSSESSION IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR EVIDENT UNEASINESS
7009-83683-0003 GAVE HIM THE APPEARANCE IN A SENSE OF BEING A GIANT AMONG PIGMIES YET THE MAJOR AT LEAST WAS IN EVERY WAY A BIGGER MAN THAN HE WAS THERE WAS SILENCE AS HE ENTERED
7009-83683-0004 A CONTINUATION OF THAT SILENCE WHICH HAD PREVAILED UNTIL HE CAME THE GOVERNOR FUMBLED WITH A PAPER KNIFE WHICH WAS IN FRONT OF HIM THE INSPECTOR LEANING FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR
7009-83683-0005 SEEMED ENGROSSED BY HIS BOOTS THE DOCTOR KEPT GLANCING PERHAPS UNCONSCIOUSLY AT HIS HAT THE CHAPLAIN THOUGH CONSPICUOUSLY UNEASY
7009-83683-0006 IT WAS HE WHO TEMPORARILY USURPING THE GOVERNOR'S FUNCTIONS ADDRESSED THE PRISONER YOUR NAME IS OLIVER MANKELL THE PRISONER MERELY SMILED
7009-83683-0007 THREE MONTHS HARD LABOUR THE PRISONER SMILED AGAIN FOR FOR PRETENDING TO TELL FORTUNES THE SMILE BECAME MORE PRONOUNCED THE CHAPLAIN CLEARED HIS THROAT OLIVER MANKELL I AM A CLERGYMAN
7009-83683-0008 I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SUCH THINGS AS GOOD AND EVIL I KNOW THAT FOR CAUSES WHICH ARE HIDDEN FROM ME THE ALMIGHTY MAY PERMIT EVIL TO TAKE VISIBLE SHAPE AND WALK ABROAD UPON THE EARTH
7009-83683-0009 BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THOUGH EVIL MAY DESTROY MY BODY
7009-83683-0010 THE CHAPLAIN PULLED UP HIS WORDS AND MANNER THOUGH EVIDENTLY SINCERE WERE NOT PARTICULARLY IMPRESSIVE WHILE THEY EVIDENTLY HAD THE EFFECT OF INCREASING HIS COLLEAGUES UNEASINESS THEY ONLY HAD THE EFFECT OF ENLARGING THE PRISONER'S SMILE
7009-83683-0011 WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO CONTINUE THE GOVERNOR INTERPOSED I THINK MISTER HEWETT IF YOU WILL PERMIT ME MANKELL I AM NOT A CLERGYMAN THE PRISONER'S SMILE ALMOST DEGENERATED INTO A GRIN
7009-83683-0012 I HAVE SENT FOR YOU FOR THE SECOND TIME THIS MORNING TO ASK YOU FRANKLY IF YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO COMPLAIN OF YOUR TREATMENT HERE THE PRISONER STRETCHED OUT HIS HANDS WITH HIS FAMILIAR GESTURE HAVE YOU ANY

7009-83683-0014 WHEN THE GOVERNOR CEASED THE PRISONER SEEMED TO BE CONSIDERING WHAT ANSWER HE SHOULD MAKE THEN INCLINING HIS HEAD WITH THAT ALMOST SATURNINE GRACE IF ONE MAY COIN A PHRASE
7009-83683-0015 YOUR CHARACTER WHAT DO YOU MEAN IN THE FIRST INTERVIEW WITH WHICH YOU FAVOURED ME I VENTURED TO OBSERVE THAT IT WOULD BE MY ENDEAVOUR DURING MY SOJOURN WITHIN THESE WALLS TO ACT UPON THE ADVICE

7009-83683-0021 THE CRITICISM SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN EXTRACTED FROM THE GOVERNOR ALMOST AGAINST HIS WILL HE LOOKED ROUND UPON HIS COLLEAGUES WITH WHAT COULD ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A GHASTLY GRIN
7009-83683-0022 TO BEING TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER PRISON SIR THE PRISONER'S VOICE RANG OUT AND HIS HEARERS STARTED PERCEPTIBLY PERHAPS THAT WAS BECAUSE THEIR NERVES WERE ALREADY SO DISORGANISED
7009-83683-0023 THE GOVERNOR TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED HIS BROW I AM BOUND TO TELL YOU MANKELL JUDGING FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF THE LAST TWO DAYS IF THIS SORT OF THING IS TO CONTINUE WITH GATHERING STRENGTH
7009-83683-0024 THE END WILL NOT BE LONG THE PRISONER SEEMED LOST IN REFLECTION THE OFFICIALS SEEMED LOST IN REFLECTION TOO BUT THEIR REFLECTIONS WERE PROBABLY OF A DIFFERENT KIND

7009-83683-0035 OLIVER MANKELL SENTENCED BY COLONEL GREGORY TO THREE MONTHS HARD LABOUR HAS BEEN IN CANTERSTONE JAIL TWO DAYS THAT SHORT SPACE OF TIME HAS HOWEVER CONVINCED THEM THAT COLONEL GREGORY ACTED WRONGLY
7009-83683-0036 IN DISTRUSTING HIS MAGIC POWERS AND SO CASTING A STAIN UPON HIS CHARACTER THIS IS TO TESTIFY THAT HE HAS PROVED TO THE ENTIRE SATISFACTION OF THE UNDERSIGNED INSPECTOR OF PRISONS
7009-83683-0037 AND OFFICIALS OF CANTERSTONE JAIL THAT HE IS A MAGICIAN OF QUITE THE HIGHEST CLASS THE SIGNATURES OF ALL THOSE PRESENT SHOULD BE PLACED AT THE BOTTOM OBSERVED THE PRISONER AS THE GOVERNOR WAS READING THE TESTIMONIAL

7009-83683-0044 THE PROPOSITION THUS REFUSED WILL NOT BE MADE AGAIN IT ONLY REMAINS FOR ME TO CONTINUE EARNESTLY MY ENDEAVOURS TO RETRIEVE MY CHARACTER UNTIL THE THREE MONTHS ARE AT AN END
7009-83683-0045 THE CHAPLAIN WAS HOLDING THE TESTIMONIAL LOOSELY BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB STRETCHING OUT HIS ARM MANKELL POINTED AT IT WITH HIS HAND IT WAS IMMEDIATELY IN FLAMES THE CHAPLAIN RELEASING IT

7009-83683-0060 THE CHIEF WARDER PLACED HIS SPECTACLES UPON HIS NOSE WHERE THEY SEEMED UNEASY AND MADE QUITE A BUSINESS OF SIGNING AND SUCH WAS WARDER SLATER'S AGITATION THAT HE COULD SCARCELY SIGN AT ALL
