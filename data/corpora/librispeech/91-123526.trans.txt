91-123526-0000 AT THE ARIZONA CAVE IT WAS DARK WHEN I OPENED MY EYES AGAIN STRANGE STIFF GARMENTS WERE UPON MY BODY
91-123526-0001 I FELT MYSELF OVER FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND FROM HEAD TO FOOT I WAS CLOTHED
91-123526-0002 BEFORE ME WAS A SMALL PATCH OF MOONLIT SKY WHICH SHOWED THROUGH A RAGGED APERTURE AS MY HANDS PASSED OVER MY BODY THEY CAME IN CONTACT WITH POCKETS AND IN ONE OF THESE A SMALL PARCEL OF MATCHES WRAPPED IN OILED PAPER
91-123526-0003 ONE OF THESE MATCHES I STRUCK AND ITS DIM FLAME LIGHTED UP WHAT APPEARED TO BE A HUGE CAVE TOWARD THE BACK OF WHICH I DISCOVERED A STRANGE STILL FIGURE HUDDLED OVER A TINY BENCH AS I APPROACHED IT
91-123526-0004 AND MUMMIFIED REMAINS OF A LITTLE OLD WOMAN WITH LONG BLACK HAIR AND THE THING IT LEANED OVER WAS A SMALL CHARCOAL BURNER UPON WHICH RESTED A ROUND COPPER VESSEL CONTAINING A SMALL QUANTITY OF GREENISH POWDER
91-123526-0005 BEHIND HER DEPENDING FROM THE ROOF UPON RAWHIDE THONGS AND STRETCHING ENTIRELY ACROSS THE CAVE WAS A ROW OF HUMAN SKELETONS FROM THE THONG WHICH HELD THEM STRETCHED ANOTHER TO THE DEAD HAND OF THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN
91-123526-0006 AS I TOUCHED THE CORD THE SKELETONS SWUNG TO THE MOTION WITH A NOISE AS OF THE RUSTLING OF DRY LEAVES IT WAS A MOST GROTESQUE AND HORRID TABLEAU AND I HASTENED OUT INTO THE FRESH AIR GLAD TO ESCAPE FROM SO GRUESOME A PLACE
91-123526-0007 THE SIGHT THAT MET MY EYES AS I STEPPED OUT UPON A SMALL LEDGE WHICH RAN BEFORE THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE FILLED ME WITH CONSTERNATION A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW LANDSCAPE MET MY GAZE
91-123526-0008 THE SILVERED MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE THE ALMOST STATIONARY MOON HANGING IN THE SKY THE CACTI STUDDED VALLEY BELOW ME WERE NOT OF MARS
91-123526-0009 BUT THE TRUTH SLOWLY FORCED ITSELF UPON ME I WAS LOOKING UPON ARIZONA FROM THE SAME LEDGE FROM WHICH TEN YEARS BEFORE I HAD GAZED WITH LONGING UPON MARS BURYING MY HEAD IN MY ARMS I TURNED
91-123526-0010 DID THE VITALIZING AIR REACH THE PEOPLE OF THAT DISTANT PLANET IN TIME TO SAVE THEM
91-123526-0011 OR DID HER BEAUTIFUL BODY LIE COLD IN DEATH BESIDE THE TINY GOLDEN INCUBATOR IN THE SUNKEN GARDEN
91-123526-0012 THE JEDDAK OF HELIUM FOR TEN YEARS I HAVE WAITED AND PRAYED FOR AN ANSWER TO MY QUESTIONS FOR TEN YEARS I HAVE WAITED AND PRAYED TO BE TAKEN BACK TO THE WORLD OF MY LOST LOVE I WOULD RATHER LIE DEAD BESIDE HER THERE
91-123526-0013 THAN LIVE ON EARTH ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF TERRIBLE MILES FROM HER THE OLD MINE WHICH I FOUND UNTOUCHED HAS MADE ME FABULOUSLY WEALTHY BUT WHAT CARE I FOR WEALTH
91-123526-0014 AS I SIT HERE TONIGHT IN MY LITTLE STUDY OVERLOOKING THE HUDSON JUST TWENTY YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE I FIRST OPENED MY EYES UPON MARS
91-123526-0015 AND TONIGHT SHE SEEMS CALLING TO ME AGAIN AS SHE HAS NOT CALLED BEFORE SINCE THAT LONG DEAD NIGHT AND I THINK I CAN SEE ACROSS THAT AWFUL ABYSS OF SPACE A BEAUTIFUL BLACK HAIRED WOMAN STANDING IN THE GARDEN OF A PALACE AND AT HER SIDE IS A LITTLE BOY WHO PUTS HIS ARM AROUND HER
