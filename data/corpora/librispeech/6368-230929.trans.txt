6368-230929-0000 AFTER ELSIE AND I GOT SPLICED TO USE THE OLD FAMILIAR LANGUAGE OF MY BOYHOOD THE EXPRESSIVE ARGOT OF THE SEA FOR WHICH I SHALL ALWAYS RETAIN A PASSIONATE LOVE
6368-230929-0001 ONLY SECOND TO THAT I BEAR TOWARDS MY DEAR WIFE WE SET OFF FOR THE CONTINENT HAVING DETERMINED TO SPEND THE HAPPY PERIOD OF OUR HONEYMOON ABROAD
6368-230929-0002 THOUGH THERE IS LITTLE IN COMMON BETWEEN US THEIR WAYS OTHERWISE NOT BEING OUR WAYS NOR THEIR THOUGHTS AMBITIONS HOPES OR DESIRES IN ANY RESPECT AKIN TO OURS
6368-230929-0003 WHERE I HAD PASSED A COUPLE OF YEARS OF MY SCHOOL LIFE STUDYING FRENCH AND TEACHING THE YOUNG SCIONS
6368-230929-0004 FOR THE TIME THE EXIGENCIES OF FOOTBALL AS WE PLAY THE GAME IN LANCASHIRE VARIED BY AN OCCASIONAL ILLUSTRATIVE EXHIBITION EXPLANATORY OF THE MERITS OF LA BOXE ANGLAISE
6368-230929-0005 TIME PASSED SWIFTLY WITH SO SWEET AND SYMPATHETIC A COMPANION OUR TASTES WERE SIMILAR BOTH TAKING THE GREATEST DELIGHT IN ANCIENT BUILDINGS AND LOVELY SCENERY
6368-230929-0006 THE WEATHER TOO WAS CHARMING AND ALTOGETHER WE WERE AS HAPPY AS TWO MORTALS CAN BE ON THIS EARTH ELSIE AND I SAW ALL THAT WAS TO BE SEEN IN THE OLD CITY WE FIRST VISITED
6368-230929-0007 WHICH IN ADDITION TO ITS ARCHITECTURAL BEAUTIES SHOULD HAVE A SPECIAL CHARM FOR ALL ENGLISHMEN FROM THE FACT OF THE DAUNTLESS RICHARD COEUR
6368-230929-0008 HAVING SUCH AN AFFECTION FOR THE TOWN THAT HE BEQUEATHED IT HIS LION HEART AND THEN WE JOURNEYED ON THROUGH LA BELLE NORMANDIE LOITERING HERE AND THERE AT THOSE HISTORIC SPOTS
6368-230929-0009 WOVEN INTO THE LIFE OF OUR COUNTRY SPOTS WHERE ARTISTS OF ALL NATIONS LOVE TO LINGER WE STAYED ANON AT SLOW SEDATE CAEN AS STILL AS THE STONE FOR WHICH IT IS CELEBRATED
6368-230929-0010 AND THAT FURNISHED THE BUILDING MATERIAL OF WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL BAYEUX BOASTFUL OF ITS ANTIQUE TAPESTRY AND DOL AND SAINT SERVAN
6368-230929-0011 IN OUR OWN SEA GIRT ISLE THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CHIPPED OUT OF THE SAME BLOCK BY ITS GRAND HANDYCRAFTSMAN TO SERVE AS A REPLICA UNTIL ENTERING BRIGHTER BRETAIGNE IN THE SUNNY SOUTH OF FRANCE
6368-230929-0012 WHERE THE LANDMARKS OF THE PAST SEEM TO STAND OUT IN BOLDER RELIEF WE VISITED NANTES AND OTHER PLACES OF INTEREST AND JOGGING ON THENCE THROUGH ANGOULEME AND
6368-230929-0013 HALTING A DAY AT POICTIERS TO FIGHT OUR PLANTAGENET
6368-230929-0014 WE FINALLY ENDED OUR PILGRIMAGE AT BORDEAUX AT THIS WONDERFULLY PICTURESQUE PORT WHOSE SEMI ANCIENT QUAINTLY MODERN ASPECT STRANGELY ATTRACTED US BOTH WE ANCHORED AWHILE
6368-230929-0015 REMAINING MANY WEEKS IN EXCESS OF THE CUSTOMARY LIMIT OF THE TRADITIONAL HONEYMOON OURS BEING AN INDEFINITE ONE AND ONLY TO BE COMPLETED WE TRUST WHEN ELSIE AND I CEASE TO BREATHE
6368-230929-0016 LATE IN THE AUTUMN WHEN THE LEAVES HAD BEGUN TO TURN RUSSET AND BROWN AND THE AIR OF A MORNING ASSUMED A CRISPER AND MORE BRACING TONE TELLING US PLAINLY AS THESE SIGNS TELL THAT SUMMER HAD FLED FOR GOOD AND AYE
6368-230929-0017 AND WINTER WAS COMING BY AND BY WE BADE ADIEU TO DEAR OLD BORDEAUX AND TAKING A STEAMER THERE BOUND FOR THE
6368-230929-0018 HAVING HAD ENOUGH OF RAILWAYS AND LAND TRAVEL WE STARTED TO VOYAGE HOME BY SEA MY NATIVE ELEMENT
6368-230929-0019 TOWARDS SUNSET WE HAD WEATHERED USHANT AND WERE SHAPING A COURSE UP CHANNEL NORTH EAST
6368-230929-0020 WHEN I NOTICED A LARGE SHIP CLOSE HAULED ON THE STARBOARD TACK STEAMING INWARDS FOR THE FRENCH COAST AS IF HEADING FOR BREST HER NEAREST PORT AT THAT MOMENT THE TIRED SUN
6368-230929-0021 WHICH PREVIOUSLY APPEARED TO LINGER ABOVE THE HORIZON UNCERTAIN WHETHER TO GO OR TO STAY DIPPED SUDDENLY AS WE WERE LOOKING AT HIM A PALE YELLOW RADIANCE SUCCEEDING THE DAZZLING BEAMS
6368-230929-0022 THAT HAD WELL NIGH BLINDED US SHINING STRAIGHT IN OUR EYES WHILE THE AFTERGLOW MOUNTING RAPIDLY INTO THE WESTERN SKY BECAME MORE AND MORE VIVID EACH MOMENT TWO PURPLE ISLANDS OF CLOUD
6368-230929-0023 WHICH FLOATED ACROSS THIS REFULGENT BACKGROUND HAVING THE LOWER EDGES DYED OF A RICH CRIMSON THAT SEEMED TO SET THE SEA ON FIRE AND TIPPED THE SPARS AND SAILS OF THE PASSING SHIP WITH FLAME SHE WAS FLYING THE FRENCH TRICOLOR
6368-230929-0024 AND AS OUR STEAMER WENT BY SALUTING HER WITH A COUPLE OF BLASTS FROM HER STEAM WHISTLE IN FRIENDLY GREETING THE STRANGER VESSEL AS A RETURN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TIME HONOURED RULE OF NAUTICAL ETIQUETTE ALWAYS OBSERVED ON SUCH OCCASIONS
6368-230929-0025 DIPPED HER ENSIGN THIS ACTION COUPLED WITH THE SIMILARITY OF THE SCENE AND ITS SURROUNDINGS THE SHIP IN THE DISTANCE WITH HER FLAG HALF ON THE HOIST THE SUNSET GLOW AND THE FACT OF MY BEING ON BOARD A STEAMER
6368-230929-0026 THEN AS NOW BROUGHT BACK TO MY MIND AT ONCE
6368-230929-0027 MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS AGO NOW THE VRAISEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE TWO BEING SIMPLY ASTOUNDING ELSIE DEAREST ELSIE I CRIED WITH A START AS THE STRANGE COINCIDENCE OF THE PRESENTMENT STRUCK ME
6368-230929-0028 THE DATE BEING EVEN IDENTICAL
6368-230929-0029 WHY OF COURSE DICK I DO SHE ANSWERED NESTLING UP TO MY SIDE AS IF FOR PROTECTION FOR WE WERE SITTING IN A WARM CORNER BY THE TAFFRAIL JUST ABAFT THE WHEEL HOUSE AND SCREENED FROM THE OBSERVATION
6368-230929-0030 OF THE REST OF THE PASSENGERS WHO WERE WALKING UP AND DOWN THE DECK AS USUAL AFTER DINNER WHY DICK DEAR IT'S THE SEVENTH OF NOVEMBER YOUR BIRTHDAY YOU KNOW
6368-230929-0031 SURELY YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY FORGOTTEN THE LITTLE PRESENT I GAVE YOU THIS MORNING MY LIKENESS IN A LOCKET FOR YOUR WATCH CHAIN A MINIATURE DONE BY THAT CLEVER ARTIST AT ORLEANS
6368-230929-0032 AND YOU TOLD ME YOU WOULD ALWAYS WEAR IT FOR MY SAKE DICK MY HUSBAND WHERE IS YOUR MEMORY NO MY LITTLE ONE
6368-230929-0033 THINKING SHE WAS GOING TO CRY AT WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS FORGETFULNESS ON MY PART HERE IT IS NEXT MY HEART LIKE YOURSELF SAID I LAUGHINGLY BUT ELSIE ALMA MIA
6368-230929-0034 I WAS THINKING OF ANOTHER ANNIVERSARY AND A FRIDAY EVENING TOO TO MAKE IT ALL THE MORE WONDERFUL DON'T YOU RECOLLECT NOW OH DICK MY DEAR HUSBAND SHE WHISPERED
6368-230929-0035 AT THE SHIP ALL ABLAZE NOW FROM THE REFLECTION OF THE SKY AND NEARLY HULL DOWN TO LEEWARD I SEE I SEE WHAT A STRANGE COINCIDENCE IT IS REALLY WONDERFUL
6368-230929-0036 IT IS MY DARLING SAID I BUT IT WAS MORE EXTRAORDINARY STILL THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME THAT MEMORABLE EVENING NOW MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS AGO
6368-230929-0037 AND MORE WONDERFUL STILL WHEN THE CAPTAIN AND SOME OF THE CREW EVEN
6368-230929-0038 SHE CRIED LOOKING UP INTO MY FACE WITH THE MOST CHARMING EXPRESSION OF DELIGHT CAUSING ME TO BE FOOLISH IN BESTOWING ANOTHER LITTLE KISS ON HER UPTURNED FACE I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WAS
6368-230929-0039 BUT WHETHER THE SHIPS WERE AS FAR APART AS THE CAPTAIN AND THE OTHERS SAY OR WHETHER THEY WERE NOT
6368-230929-0040 AND YOU ON HER AS I TOLD MY DEAR DEAR FATHER AT THE TIME AND HE HIMSELF DID NOT BELIEVE IT DICK DEAR
6368-230929-0041 AS THE SCOTCH PEOPLE CALL IT THERE WAS A NUN AT THE CONVENT WHO HAD IT AND COULD TELL SO SHE SAID WHEN ANYTHING WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO ANY OF HER FAMILY THOUGH SHE COULDN'T PREDICT EVENTS CONCERNING PERSONS
6368-230929-0042 WHO WERE NOT BLOOD RELATIONS AS SHE TERMED THEM DON'T BE FRIGHTENED DICK
6368-230929-0043 THE SAME FACULTY WELL IF THAT IS THE CASE SWEETHEART SAID I THERE MUST BE SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL AFFINITY BETWEEN US AND WE ARE BOTH ENDOWED WITH THE SAME WEIRD GIFT ALTHOUGH THE POSSESSION OF THE SAME
6368-230929-0044 HAS NEVER BEEN BROUGHT TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF US EXCEPT ON THAT ONE MEMORABLE OCCASION THAT CANNOT BE OTHERWISE EXPLAINED BUT THE FACT OF THE TWO SHIPS MEETING AFTERWARDS MAY VERY
6368-230929-0045 READILY BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE WINDS AND CURRENTS OF THE OCEAN DRIFTED THEM TOGETHER
6368-230929-0046 AND AS OUR STEAMER SPEEDED ON HER WAY THE GLOW IN THE SKY GRADUALLY FADED AND DARKNESS CREPT OVER THE FACE OF THE SEA THE FLASHING LIGHT OF USHANT WHIRLING ITS LUMINOUS ARMS ROUND IN RAPID ROTATION
6368-230929-0047 LIKE SOME SPECTRAL WINDMILL AWAY IN THE DISTANCE OVER OUR LEE WHERE THE FRENCH SHIP HAD LONG SINCE DISAPPEARED PRESENTLY MY ELSIE WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING DOWN INTO THE NOW GLOOMY DEPTHS ALONGSIDE
6368-230929-0048 MUSING OVER THE BITTER SWEET MEMORIES OF THE PAST LIFTED HER EYES TO MINE GLANCING HEAVENWARDS NO DICK MY DEAREST SAID SHE SPEAKING AT LAST
6368-230929-0049 A CERTAIN HESITATION AND CATCH IN HER THROAT AND A TEAR IN THE BROKEN INTONATION OF HER VOICE
