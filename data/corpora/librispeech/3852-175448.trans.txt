3852-175448-0000 APPENDIX A THE WORK OF THE FIELD ZOOLOGIST AND FIELD GEOGRAPHER IN SOUTH AMERICA PORTIONS OF SOUTH AMERICA ARE NOW ENTERING ON A CAREER OF GREAT SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
3852-175448-0001 MUCH REMAINS TO BE KNOWN SO FAR AS THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS CONCERNED OF THE SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CONDITION IN THE LONG SETTLED INTERIOR REGIONS
3852-175448-0002 MORE REMAINS TO BE DONE IN THE WAY OF PIONEER EXPLORING AND OF SCIENTIFIC WORK IN THE GREAT STRETCHES OF VIRGIN WILDERNESS THE ONLY TWO OTHER CONTINENTS WHERE SUCH WORK OF LIKE VOLUME AND VALUE REMAINS TO BE DONE ARE AFRICA AND ASIA
3852-175448-0003 AND NEITHER AFRICA NOR ASIA OFFERS A MORE INVITING FIELD FOR THE BEST KIND OF FIELD WORKER IN GEOGRAPHICAL EXPLORATION AND IN ZOOLOGICAL GEOLOGICAL AND PALEONTOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION
3852-175448-0004 THE EXPLORER IS MERELY THE MOST ADVENTUROUS KIND OF FIELD GEOGRAPHER AND THERE ARE TWO OR THREE POINTS WORTH KEEPING IN MIND IN DEALING WITH THE SOUTH AMERICAN WORK OF THE FIELD GEOGRAPHER AND FIELD ZOOLOGIST
3852-175448-0005 ROUGHLY THE TRAVELLERS WHO NOW VISIT LIKE THOSE WHO FOR THE PAST CENTURY HAVE VISITED SOUTH AMERICA COME IN THREE CATEGORIES ALTHOUGH OF COURSE THESE CATEGORIES ARE NOT DIVIDED BY HARD AND FAST LINES
3852-175448-0006 FIRST THERE ARE THE TRAVELLERS WHO SKIRT THE CONTINENT IN COMFORTABLE STEAMERS GOING FROM ONE GREAT SEAPORT TO ANOTHER AND OCCASIONALLY TAKING A SHORT RAILWAY JOURNEY TO SOME BIG INTERIOR CITY NOT TOO FAR FROM THE COAST
3852-175448-0007 THIS IS A TRIP WELL WORTH TAKING BY ALL INTELLIGENT MEN AND WOMEN WHO CAN AFFORD IT AND IT IS BEING TAKEN BY SUCH MEN AND WOMEN WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY IT ENTAILS NO MORE DIFFICULTY THAN A SIMILAR TRIP TO THE MEDITERRANEAN
3852-175448-0008 THAN SUCH A TRIP WHICH TO A LEARNED AND BROAD MINDED OBSERVER OFFERS THE SAME CHANCE FOR ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE AND IF HE IS HIMSELF GIFTED WITH WISDOM THE SAME CHANCE OF IMPARTING HIS KNOWLEDGE TO OTHERS
3852-175448-0009 THAT IS OFFERED BY A TRIP OF SIMILAR LENGTH THROUGH THE LARGER CITIES OF EUROPE OR THE UNITED STATES PROBABLY THE BEST INSTANCE OF THE EXCELLENT USE TO WHICH SUCH AN OBSERVER CAN PUT HIS EXPERIENCE IS AFFORDED BY THE VOLUME OF MISTER BRYCE
3852-175448-0010 OF COURSE SUCH A TRIP REPRESENTS TRAVELLING OF ESSENTIALLY THE SAME KIND AS TRAVELLING BY RAILROAD FROM ATLANTA TO CALGARY OR FROM MADRID TO MOSCOW NEXT THERE ARE THE TRAVELLERS WHO VISIT THE LONG SETTLED DISTRICTS AND COLONIAL CITIES OF THE INTERIOR
3852-175448-0011 TRAVELLING OVER LAND OR RIVER HIGHWAYS WHICH HAVE BEEN TRAVERSED FOR CENTURIES BUT WHICH ARE STILL PRIMITIVE AS REGARDS THE INNS AND THE MODES OF CONVEYANCE SUCH TRAVELLING IS DIFFICULT IN THE SENSE THAT TRAVELLING IN PARTS OF SPAIN OR SOUTHERN ITALY
3852-175448-0012 OR THE BALKAN STATES IS DIFFICULT MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE A TASTE FOR TRAVEL IN OUT OF WAY PLACES AND WHO THEREFORE DO NOT MIND SLIGHT DISCOMFORTS AND INCONVENIENCES HAVE THE CHANCE THEMSELVES TO ENJOY AND TO MAKE OTHERS PROFIT BY
3852-175448-0013 TRAVELS OF THIS KIND IN SOUTH AMERICA IN ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND POLITICAL MATTERS THE STUDIES AND OBSERVATIONS OF THESE TRAVELLERS ARE ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO SUPPLEMENT AND SOMETIMES TO CORRECT THOSE OF TRAVELLERS OF THE FIRST CATEGORY
3852-175448-0014 FOR IT IS NOT SAFE TO GENERALIZE OVERMUCH ABOUT ANY COUNTRY MERELY FROM A VISIT TO ITS CAPITAL OR ITS CHIEF SEAPORT THESE TRAVELLERS OF THE SECOND CATEGORY CAN GIVE US MOST INTERESTING AND VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT QUAINT LITTLE BELATED CITIES
3852-175448-0015 ABOUT BACKWARD COUNTRY FOLK KINDLY OR THE REVERSE WHO SHOW A MIXTURE OF THE IDEAS OF SAVAGERY WITH THE IDEAS OF AN ANCIENT PEASANTRY AND ABOUT ROUGH OLD HIGHWAYS OF TRAVEL WHICH IN COMFORT DO NOT DIFFER MUCH FROM THOSE OF MEDIAEVAL EUROPE
3852-175448-0016 THE TRAVELLERS WHO GO UP OR DOWN THE HIGHWAY RIVERS THAT HAVE BEEN TRAVELLED FOR FROM ONE TO FOUR HUNDRED YEARS RIVERS LIKE THE PARAGUAY AND PARANA THE AMAZON THE TAPAJOS THE MADEIRA THE LOWER ORINOCO
3852-175448-0017 COME IN THIS CATEGORY THEY CAN ADD LITTLE TO OUR GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE BUT IF THEY ARE COMPETENT ZOOLOGISTS OR ARCHAEOLOGISTS ESPECIALLY IF THEY LIVE OR SOJOURN LONG IN A LOCALITY
3852-175448-0018 THEIR WORK MAY BE INVALUABLE FROM THE SCIENTIFIC STANDPOINT THE WORK OF THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS AMONG THE IMMEASURABLY ANCIENT RUINS OF THE LOW LAND FORESTS AND THE ANDEAN PLATEAUX IS OF THIS KIND
3852-175448-0019 ARE OTHER INSTANCES OF THE WORK THAT CAN THUS BE DONE BURTON'S WRITINGS ON THE INTERIOR OF BRAZIL OFFER AN EXCELLENT INSTANCE OF THE VALUE OF A SOJOURN OR TRIP OF THIS TYPE EVEN WITHOUT ANY ESPECIAL SCIENTIFIC OBJECT
3852-175448-0020 OF COURSE TRAVELLERS OF THIS KIND NEED TO REMEMBER THAT THEIR EXPERIENCES IN THEMSELVES DO NOT QUALIFY THEM TO SPEAK AS WILDERNESS EXPLORERS
3852-175448-0021 EXACTLY AS A GOOD ARCHAEOLOGIST MAY NOT BE COMPETENT TO SPEAK OF CURRENT SOCIAL OR POLITICAL PROBLEMS SO A MAN WHO HAS DONE CAPITAL WORK AS A TOURIST OBSERVER IN LITTLE VISITED CITIES AND ALONG REMOTE HIGHWAYS
3852-175448-0022 MUST BEWARE OF REGARDING HIMSELF AS BEING THEREBY RENDERED FIT FOR GENUINE WILDERNESS WORK OR COMPETENT TO PASS JUDGMENT ON THE MEN WHO DO SUCH WORK TO CROSS THE ANDES ON MULE BACK ALONG THE REGULAR ROUTES IS A FEAT
3852-175448-0023 COMPARABLE TO THE FEATS OF THE ENERGETIC TOURISTS WHO BY THOUSANDS TRAVERSE THE MULE TRAILS IN OUT OF THE WAY NOOKS OF SWITZERLAND AN ORDINARY TRIP ON THE HIGHWAY PORTIONS OF THE AMAZON PARAGUAY OR ORINOCO IN ITSELF
3852-175448-0024 NO MORE QUALIFIES A MAN TO SPEAK OF OR TO TAKE PART IN EXPLORING UNKNOWN SOUTH AMERICAN RIVERS THAN A TRIP ON THE LOWER SAINT LAWRENCE QUALIFIES A MAN TO REGARD HIMSELF AS AN EXPERT IN A CANOE VOYAGE ACROSS LABRADOR
3852-175448-0025 OR THE BARREN GROUNDS WEST OF HUDSON BAY A HUNDRED YEARS AGO EVEN SEVENTY OR EIGHTY YEARS AGO BEFORE THE AGE OF STEAMBOATS AND RAILROADS IT WAS MORE DIFFICULT THAN AT PRESENT TO DEFINE THE LIMITS BETWEEN THIS CLASS AND THE NEXT
3852-175448-0026 FOR BOOKS OF TRAVEL DARWIN'S VOYAGE OF THE BEAGLE IS TO ME THE BEST BOOK OF THE KIND EVER WRITTEN IT IS ONE OF THOSE CLASSICS WHICH DECLINE TO GO INTO ARTIFICIAL CATEGORIES AND WHICH STAND BY THEMSELVES
3852-175448-0027 AND YET DARWIN WITH HIS USUAL MODESTY SPOKE OF IT AS IN EFFECT A YACHTING VOYAGE HUMBOLDT'S WORK HAD A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE THOUGHT OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD HIS TRIP WAS ONE OF ADVENTURE AND DANGER
3852-175448-0028 AND YET IT CAN HARDLY BE CALLED EXPLORATION PROPER HE VISITED PLACES WHICH HAD BEEN SETTLED AND INHABITED FOR CENTURIES AND TRAVERSED PLACES WHICH HAD BEEN TRAVELLED BY CIVILIZED MEN FOR YEARS BEFORE HE FOLLOWED IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS
3852-175448-0029 BUT THESE PLACES WERE IN SPANISH COLONIES AND ACCESS TO THEM HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN BY THE MISCHIEVOUS AND INTOLERANT TYRANNY ECCLESIASTICAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC WHICH THEN RENDERED SPAIN THE MOST BACKWARD OF EUROPEAN NATIONS
3852-175448-0030 AND HUMBOLDT WAS THE FIRST SCIENTIFIC MAN OF INTELLECTUAL INDEPENDENCE WHO HAD PERMISSION TO VISIT THEM TO THIS DAY MANY OF HIS SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATIONS ARE OF REAL VALUE
3852-175448-0031 BATES CAME TO THE AMAZON JUST BEFORE THE ERA OF AMAZONIAN STEAMBOATS HE NEVER WENT OFF THE NATIVE ROUTES OF ORDINARY TRAVEL BUT HE WAS A DEVOTED AND ABLE NATURALIST
3852-175448-0032 HE LIVED AN EXCEEDINGLY ISOLATED PRIMITIVE AND LABORIOUS LIFE FOR ELEVEN YEARS NOW HALF A CENTURY AFTER IT WAS WRITTEN HIS NATURALIST ON THE AMAZON IS AS INTERESTING AND VALUABLE AS IT EVER WAS
3852-175448-0033 AND NO BOOK SINCE WRITTEN HAS IN ANY WAY SUPPLANTED IT TRAVEL OF THE THIRD CATEGORY INCLUDES THE WORK OF THE TRUE WILDERNESS EXPLORERS WHO ADD TO OUR SUM OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE AND OF THE SCIENTIFIC MEN WHO FOLLOWING THEIR SEVERAL BENTS
3852-175448-0034 ALSO WORK IN THE UNTRODDEN WILDS COLONEL RONDON AND HIS ASSOCIATES HAVE DONE MUCH IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL EXPLORATION OF UNKNOWN COUNTRY AND CHERRIE AND MILLER HAVE PENETRATED AND LIVED FOR MONTHS AND YEARS IN THE WASTES ON THEIR OWN RESOURCES
3852-175448-0035 AS INCIDENTS TO THEIR MAMMALOGICAL AND ORNITHOLOGICAL WORK PROFESSOR FARRABEE THE ANTHROPOLOGIST IS A CAPITAL EXAMPLE OF THE MAN WHO DOES THIS HARD AND VALUABLE TYPE OF WORK
3852-175448-0036 AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF THIS TRUE WILDERNESS WORK GEOGRAPHICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL REMAINS TO BE DONE IN SOUTH AMERICA IT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH REASONABLE THOROUGHNESS ONLY BY THE EFFORTS OF VERY MANY DIFFERENT WORKERS EACH IN HIS OWN SPECIAL FIELD
3852-175448-0037 IT IS DESIRABLE THAT HERE AND THERE A PART OF THE WORK SHOULD BE DONE IN OUTLINE BY SUCH A GEOGRAPHIC AND ZOOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE AS OURS WE WOULD FOR EXAMPLE BE VERY GRATEFUL FOR SUCH WORK IN PORTIONS OF THE INTERIOR OF THE GUIANAS
3852-175448-0038 ON THE HEADWATERS OF THE XINGU AND HERE AND THERE ALONG THE EASTERN BASE OF THE ANDES BUT AS A RULE THE WORK MUST BE SPECIALIZED AND IN ITS FINAL SHAPE IT MUST BE SPECIALIZED EVERYWHERE
3852-175448-0039 CANNOT TAKE WITH THEM THE ELABORATE EQUIPMENT NECESSARY IN ORDER TO DO THE THOROUGH SCIENTIFIC WORK DEMANDED BY MODERN SCIENTIFIC REQUIREMENTS THIS IS TRUE EVEN OF EXPLORATION DONE ALONG THE COURSES OF UNKNOWN RIVERS
3852-175448-0040 IT IS MORE TRUE OF THE EXPLORATION WHICH MUST IN SOUTH AMERICA BECOME INCREASINGLY NECESSARY DONE ACROSS COUNTRY AWAY FROM THE RIVERS THE SCIENTIFIC WORK PROPER OF THESE EARLY EXPLORERS MUST BE OF A SOMEWHAT PRELIMINARY NATURE
3852-175448-0041 IN OTHER WORDS THE MOST DIFFICULT AND THEREFORE ORDINARILY THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECES OF FIRST HAND EXPLORATION ARE PRECISELY THOSE WHERE THE SCIENTIFIC WORK OF THE ACCOMPANYING CARTOGRAPHER GEOLOGIST BOTANIST AND ZOOLOGIST
3852-175448-0042 MUST BE FURTHEST REMOVED FROM FINALITY THE ZOOLOGIST WHO WORKS TO MOST ADVANTAGE IN THE WILDERNESS MUST TAKE HIS TIME AND THEREFORE HE MUST NORMALLY FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF AND NOT ACCOMPANY THE FIRST EXPLORERS
3852-175448-0043 THERE IS NO BETTER EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF ZOOLOGIST WHO DOES FIRST CLASS FIELD WORK IN THE WILDERNESS THAN JOHN D HASEMAN WHO SPENT FROM NINETEEN O SEVEN TO NINETEEN TEN IN PAINSTAKING AND THOROUGH SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION
3852-175448-0044 OVER A LARGE EXTENT OF SOUTH AMERICAN TERRITORY HITHERTO ONLY PARTIALLY KNOWN OR QUITE UNEXPLORED HASEMAN'S PRIMARY OBJECT WAS TO STUDY THE CHARACTERISTICS AND DISTRIBUTION OF SOUTH AMERICAN FISHES
3852-175448-0045 BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT HE STUDIED AT FIRST HAND MANY OTHER MORE OR LESS KINDRED SUBJECTS AS MAY BE SEEN IN HIS REMARKS ON THE INDIANS AND IN HIS EXCELLENT PAMPHLET ON SOME FACTORS OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION IN SOUTH AMERICA
3852-175448-0046 HIS WRITINGS ARE RENDERED VALUABLE BY HIS ACCURACY AND COMMON SENSE THE NEED OF THE FORMER OF THESE TWO ATTRIBUTES WILL BE APPRECIATED BY WHOEVER HAS STUDIED THE REALLY SCANDALOUS FICTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED AS GENUINE BY SOME MODERN EXPLORERS
3852-175448-0047 AND ADVENTURERS IN SOUTH AMERICA AND THE NEED OF THE LATTER BY WHOEVER HAS STUDIED SOME OF THE WILD THEORIES PROPOUNDED IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE CONCERNING THE HISTORY OF LIFE ON THE SOUTH AMERICAN CONTINENT THERE IS HOWEVER ONE SERIOUS CRITICISM TO BE MADE ON HASEMAN
3852-175448-0048 THE EXTREME OBSCURITY OF HIS STYLE AN OBSCURITY MIXED WITH OCCASIONAL BITS OF SCIENTIFIC PEDANTRY WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO TELL WHETHER OR NOT ON SOME POINTS HIS THOUGHT IS OBSCURE ALSO
3852-175448-0049 MODERN SCIENTISTS LIKE MODERN HISTORIANS AND ABOVE ALL SCIENTIFIC AND HISTORICAL EDUCATORS SHOULD EVER KEEP IN MIND THAT CLEARNESS OF SPEECH AND WRITING IS ESSENTIAL TO CLEARNESS OF THOUGHT AND THAT A SIMPLE CLEAR
3852-175448-0050 AND IF POSSIBLE VIVID STYLE IS VITAL TO THE PRODUCTION OF THE BEST WORK IN EITHER SCIENCE OR HISTORY DARWIN AND HUXLEY ARE CLASSICS AND THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IF THEY HAD NOT WRITTEN GOOD ENGLISH THE THOUGHT IS ESSENTIAL
3852-175448-0051 BUT ABILITY TO GIVE IT CLEAR EXPRESSION IS ONLY LESS ESSENTIAL ABILITY TO WRITE WELL IF THE WRITER HAS NOTHING TO WRITE ABOUT ENTITLES HIM TO MERE DERISION BUT THE GREATEST THOUGHT IS ROBBED OF AN IMMENSE PROPORTION OF ITS VALUE
3852-175448-0052 IF EXPRESSED IN A MEAN OR OBSCURE MANNER MISTER HASEMAN HAS SUCH EXCELLENT THOUGHT THAT IT IS A PITY TO MAKE IT A WORK OF IRRITATING LABOR TO FIND OUT JUST WHAT THE THOUGHT IS
3852-175448-0053 SURELY IF HE WILL TAKE AS MUCH PAINS WITH HIS WRITING AS HE HAS WITH THE FAR MORE DIFFICULT BUSINESS OF EXPLORING AND COLLECTING HE WILL BECOME ABLE TO EXPRESS HIS THOUGHT CLEARLY AND FORCEFULLY
3852-175448-0054 AT LEAST HE CAN IF HE CHOOSES GO OVER HIS SENTENCES UNTIL HE IS REASONABLY SURE THAT THEY CAN BE PARSED HE CAN TAKE PAINS TO SEE THAT HIS WHOLE THOUGHT IS EXPRESSED
3852-175448-0055 INSTEAD OF LEAVING VACANCIES WHICH MUST BE FILLED BY THE PUZZLED AND GROPING READER HIS OWN VIEWS AND HIS QUOTATIONS FROM THE VIEWS OF OTHERS ABOUT THE STATIC AND DYNAMIC THEORIES OF DISTRIBUTION ARE EXAMPLES OF AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE
3852-175448-0056 SO IMPERFECTLY EXPRESSED AS TO MAKE US DOUBTFUL WHETHER IT IS PERFECTLY APPREHENDED BY THE WRITER HE CAN AVOID THE USE OF THOSE PEDANTIC TERMS WHICH ARE REALLY NOTHING BUT OFFENSIVE AND FORTUNATELY EPHEMERAL SCIENTIFIC SLANG
3852-175448-0057 THERE HAS BEEN FOR INSTANCE A RECENT VOGUE FOR THE EXTENSIVE MISUSE USUALLY TAUTOLOGICAL MISUSE OF THE WORD COMPLEXUS AN EXCELLENT WORD IF USED RARELY AND FOR DEFINITE PURPOSES
3852-175448-0058 MISTER HASEMAN DRAGS IT IN CONTINUALLY WHEN ITS USE IS EITHER POINTLESS AND REDUNDANT OR ELSE SERVES PURELY TO DARKEN WISDOM HE SPEAKS OF THE ANTILLEAN COMPLEX WHEN HE MEANS THE ANTILLES OF THE ORGANIC COMPLEX
3852-175448-0059 INSTEAD OF THE CHARACTERISTIC OR BODILY CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ANIMAL OR SPECIES AND OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLEX WHEN HE MEANS NOTHING WHATEVER BUT THE ENVIRONMENT
3852-175448-0060 USE COMPLEXUS IN MUCH THE SAME SPIRIT AS THAT DISPLAYED BY THE FAMOUS OLD LADY WHO DERIVED RELIGIOUS INSTEAD OF SCIENTIFIC CONSOLATION FROM THE USE OF
3852-175448-0061 THE REASON THAT IT IS WORTH WHILE TO ENTER THIS PROTEST AGAINST MISTER HASEMAN'S STYLE IS BECAUSE HIS WORK IS OF SUCH REAL AND MARKED VALUE THE PAMPHLET ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF SOUTH AMERICAN SPECIES SHOWS THAT TO EXCEPTIONAL ABILITY AS A FIELD WORKER
3852-175448-0062 HE ADDS A RARE POWER TO DRAW WITH BOTH CAUTION AND ORIGINALITY THE NECESSARY GENERAL CONCLUSIONS FROM THE RESULTS OF HIS OWN OBSERVATIONS AND FROM THE RECORDED STUDIES OF OTHER MEN
3852-175448-0063 AND THERE IS NOTHING MORE NEEDED AT THE PRESENT MOMENT AMONG OUR SCIENTIFIC MEN THAN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SCHOOL OF MEN WHO WHILE INDUSTRIOUS AND MINUTE OBSERVERS AND COLLECTORS AND CAUTIOUS GENERALIZERS
3852-175448-0064 YET DO NOT PERMIT THE FACULTY OF WISE GENERALIZATION TO BE ATROPHIED BY EXCESSIVE DEVOTION TO LABYRINTHINE DETAIL HASEMAN UPHOLDS WITH STRONG REASONING THE THEORY THAT SINCE THE APPEARANCE OF ALL BUT THE LOWEST FORMS OF LIFE ON THIS GLOBE
3852-175448-0065 THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THREE GREAT CONTINENTAL MASSES SOMETIMES SOLID SOMETIMES BROKEN EXTENDING SOUTHWARD FROM THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE AND FROM TIME TO TIME CONNECTED IN THE NORTH
3852-175448-0066 SINCE THE CARBONIFEROUS EPOCH HE HOLDS THAT LIFE HAS BEEN INTERMITTENTLY DISTRIBUTED SOUTHWARD ALONG THESE CONTINENTAL MASSES WHEN THERE WERE NO BREAKS IN THEIR SOUTHWARD CONNECTION AND INTERMITTENTLY EXCHANGED BETWEEN THEM WHEN THEY WERE CONNECTED IN THE NORTH
3852-175448-0067 AND HE ALSO UPHOLDS THE VIEW THAT FROM A COMMON ANCESTRAL FORM THE SAME SPECIES HAS BEEN OFTEN DEVELOPED IN ENTIRELY DISCONNECTED LOCALITIES WHEN IN THESE LOCALITIES THE CONDITIONS OF ENVIRONMENT WERE THE SAME
3852-175448-0068 THE OPPOSITE VIEW IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN FREQUENT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE GREAT LAND MASSES ALIKE IN THE TROPICS IN THE SOUTH TEMPERATE ZONE AND IN THE ANTARCTIC REGION
3852-175448-0069 THE UPHOLDERS OF THIS THEORY BASE IT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF LIVING AND FOSSIL FORMS OF LIFE THAT IS IT IS BASED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON BIOLOGICAL AND NOT GEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
3852-175448-0070 UNQUESTIONABLY THE DISTRIBUTION OF MANY FORMS OF LIFE PAST AND PRESENT OFFERS PROBLEMS WHICH WITH OUR PRESENT PALEONTOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE WE ARE WHOLLY UNABLE TO SOLVE
3852-175448-0071 IF WE CONSIDER ONLY THE BIOLOGICAL FACTS CONCERNING SOME ONE GROUP OF ANIMALS IT IS NOT ONLY EASY BUT INEVITABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT ITS DISTRIBUTION MUST BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EXISTENCE OF SOME FORMER DIRECT LAND BRIDGE EXTENDING
3852-175448-0072 FOR INSTANCE BETWEEN PATAGONIA AND AUSTRALIA OR BETWEEN BRAZIL AND SOUTH AFRICA OR BETWEEN THE WEST INDIES AND THE MEDITERRANEAN OR BETWEEN A PART OF THE ANDEAN REGION AND NORTHEASTERN ASIA
3852-175448-0073 THE TROUBLE IS THAT AS MORE GROUPS OF ANIMALS ARE STUDIED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THIS HYPOTHESIS THE NUMBER OF SUCH LAND BRIDGES DEMANDED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EXISTING FACTS OF ANIMAL DISTRIBUTION IS CONSTANTLY AND INDEFINITELY EXTENDED
3852-175448-0074 AND ALL THE OTHER CONTINENTS PRESENT AND PAST OF THE WORLD SINCE A PERIOD GEOLOGICALLY NOT VERY REMOTE THESE LAND BRIDGES MOREOVER MUST MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN LITERALLY BRIDGES
3852-175448-0075 LONG NARROW TONGUES OF LAND THRUST IN EVERY DIRECTION ACROSS THE BROAD OCEANS ACCORDING TO THIS VIEW THE CONTINENTAL LAND MASSES HAVE BEEN IN A FAIRLY FLUID CONDITION OF INSTABILITY
3852-175448-0076 BY PARITY OF REASONING THE LAND BRIDGES COULD BE MADE A HUNDRED INSTEAD OF MERELY TEN IN NUMBER THE FACTS OF DISTRIBUTION ARE IN MANY CASES INEXPLICABLE WITH OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE
3852-175448-0077 YET IF THE EXISTENCE OF WIDELY SEPARATED BUT CLOSELY ALLIED FORMS IS HABITUALLY TO BE EXPLAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE VIEWS OF THE EXTREMISTS OF THIS SCHOOL WE COULD FROM THE EXCLUSIVE STUDY OF CERTAIN GROUPS OF ANIMALS
3852-175448-0078 CONCLUDE THAT AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE UNITED STATES AND ALMOST EVERY OTHER PORTION OF THE EARTH WERE CONNECTED BY LAND AND SEVERED FROM ALL OTHER REGIONS BY WATER AND FROM THE STUDY OF CERTAIN OTHER GROUPS OF ANIMALS
3852-175448-0079 ARRIVE AT DIRECTLY OPPOSITE AND INCOMPATIBLE CONCLUSIONS THE MOST BRILLIANT AND UNSAFE EXPONENT OF THIS SCHOOL WAS AMEGHINO WHO POSSESSED AND ABUSED TWO GIFTS BOTH ESSENTIAL TO THE HIGHEST TYPE OF SCIENTIST
3852-175448-0080 AND BOTH MISCHIEVOUS UNLESS THIS SCIENTIST POSSESS A RARE AND ACCURATE HABIT OF THOUGHT JOINED TO INDUSTRY AND MASTERY OF DETAIL NAMELY THE GIFT OF CLEAR AND INTERESTING WRITING AND THE GIFT OF GENERALIZATION
3852-175448-0081 AMEGHINO RENDERED MARKED SERVICES TO PALEONTOLOGY BUT HE GENERALIZED WITH COMPLETE RECKLESSNESS FROM THE SLENDEREST DATA AND EVEN THESE DATA HE OFTEN COMPLETELY MISUNDERSTOOD OR MISINTERPRETED
3852-175448-0082 HIS FAVORITE THESIS INCLUDED THE ORIGIN OF MAMMALIAN LIFE AND OF MAN HIMSELF IN SOUTHERNMOST SOUTH AMERICA WITH AS INCIDENTS THE BELIEF THAT THE MAMMALIAN BEARING STRATA OF SOUTH AMERICA
3852-175448-0083 WERE OF MUCH GREATER AGE THAN THE STRATA WITH CORRESPONDING REMAINS ELSEWHERE THAT IN SOUTH AMERICA VARIOUS SPECIES AND GENERA OF MEN EXISTED IN TERTIARY TIMES
3852-175448-0084 SOME OF THEM AT LEAST AS ADVANCED AS FAIRLY WELL ADVANCED MODERN SAVAGES THAT THERE EXISTED VARIOUS LAND BRIDGES BETWEEN SOUTH AMERICA AND OTHER SOUTHERN CONTINENTS INCLUDING AFRICA
3852-175448-0085 AND THAT THE ANCESTRAL TYPES OF MODERN MAMMALS AND OF MAN HIMSELF WANDERED ACROSS ONE OF THESE BRIDGES TO THE OLD WORLD AND THAT THENCE THEIR REMOTE DESCENDANTS AFTER AGES OF TIME RETURNED TO THE NEW
3852-175448-0086 IN ADDITION TO VALUABLE INVESTIGATIONS OF FOSSIL BEARING BEDS IN THE ARGENTINE HE MADE SOME EXCELLENT GENERAL SUGGESTIONS SUCH AS THAT THE PITHECOID APES LIKE THE BABOONS DO NOT STAND IN THE LINE OF MAN'S ANCESTRAL STEM
3852-175448-0087 BUT REPRESENT A DIVERGENCE FROM IT AWAY FROM HUMANITY AND TOWARD A RETROGRESSIVE BESTIALIZATION BUT OF HIS MAIN THESES HE PROVES NONE AND WHAT EVIDENCE WE HAVE TELLS AGAINST THEM
3852-175448-0088 AT THE MUSEUM OF LA PLATA I FOUND THAT THE AUTHORITIES WERE PRACTICALLY A UNIT IN REGARDING HIS REMAINS OF TERTIARY MEN AND PROTO MEN
3852-175448-0089 AS BEING EITHER THE REMAINS OF TERTIARY AMERICAN MONKEYS OR OF AMERICAN INDIANS FROM STRATA THAT WERE LONG POST TERTIARY THE EXTRAORDINARY DISCOVERY DUE TO THAT EMINENT SCIENTIST AND PUBLIC SERVANT DOCTOR MORENO
3852-175448-0090 OF THE REMAINS OF MAN ASSOCIATED WITH THE REMAINS OF THE GREAT EXTINCT SOUTH AMERICAN FAUNA OF THE MYLODON OF A GIANT UNGULATE OF A HUGE CAT LIKE THE LION AND OF AN EXTRAORDINARY ABERRANT HORSE
3852-175448-0091 OF A WHOLLY DIFFERENT GENUS FROM THE MODERN HORSE CONCLUSIVELY SHOWS THAT IN ITS LATER STAGES THE SOUTH AMERICAN FAUNA CONSISTED LARGELY OF TYPES THAT ELSEWHERE HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED
3852-175448-0092 AND THAT THESE TYPES PERSISTED INTO WHAT WAS GEOLOGICALLY A VERY RECENT PERIOD ONLY SOME TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO WHEN SAVAGE MAN OF PRACTICALLY A MODERN TYPE HAD ALREADY APPEARED IN SOUTH AMERICA
3852-175448-0093 THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE SO FAR AS IT GOES TENDS TO SHOW THAT THE SOUTH AMERICAN FAUNA ALWAYS HAS BEEN MORE ARCHAIC IN TYPE THAN THE ARCTOGEAL FAUNA OF THE SAME CHRONOLOGICAL LEVEL
3852-175448-0094 TO LOOSE GENERALIZATIONS AND TO ELABORATE MISINTERPRETATIONS OF PALEONTOLOGICAL RECORDS THE KIND OF WORK DONE BY MISTER HASEMAN FURNISHES AN INVALUABLE ANTISCORBUTIC
3852-175448-0095 TO MY MIND HE HAS ESTABLISHED A STRONGER PRESUMPTION IN FAVOR OF THE THEORY HE CHAMPIONS THAN HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN FAVOR OF THE THEORIES OF ANY OF THE LEARNED AND ABLE SCIENTIFIC MEN FROM WHOSE CONCLUSIONS HE DISSENTS
3852-175448-0096 FURTHER RESEARCH CAREFUL ACCURATE AND LONG EXTENDED CAN ALONE ENABLE US TO DECIDE DEFINITELY IN THE MATTER
