3137-163504-0000 GUDBRAND ON THE HILL SIDE ONCE ON A TIME THERE WAS A MAN WHOSE NAME WAS GUDBRAND HE HAD A FARM WHICH LAY FAR FAR AWAY UPON A HILL SIDE AND SO THEY CALLED HIM GUDBRAND ON THE HILL SIDE NOW
3137-163504-0001 YOU MUST KNOW THIS MAN AND HIS GOODWIFE LIVED SO HAPPILY TOGETHER AND UNDERSTOOD ONE ANOTHER SO WELL THAT ALL THE HUSBAND DID THE WIFE THOUGHT SO WELL DONE THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE IT IN THE WORLD AND SHE WAS ALWAYS GLAD WHATEVER HE TURNED HIS HAND TO
3137-163504-0002 THE FARM WAS THEIR OWN LAND AND THEY HAD A HUNDRED DOLLARS LYING AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR CHEST AND TWO COWS TETHERED UP IN A STALL IN THEIR FARM YARD SO ONE DAY HIS WIFE SAID TO GUDBRAND DO YOU KNOW DEAR
3137-163504-0003 I THINK WE OUGHT TO TAKE ONE OF OUR COWS INTO TOWN AND SELL IT THAT'S WHAT I THINK FOR THEN WE SHALL HAVE SOME MONEY IN HAND AND SUCH WELL TO DO PEOPLE AS WE OUGHT TO HAVE READY MONEY LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD
3137-163504-0004 WE CAN'T MAKE A HOLE IN THEM AND I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WANT WITH MORE THAN ONE COW BESIDES WE SHALL GAIN A LITTLE IN ANOTHER WAY FOR THEN I SHALL GET OFF WITH ONLY LOOKING AFTER ONE COW INSTEAD OF HAVING AS NOW
3137-163504-0005 TO FEED AND LITTER AND WATER TWO WELL GUDBRAND THOUGHT HIS WIFE TALKED RIGHT GOOD SENSE
3137-163504-0006 BUT WHEN HE GOT TO THE TOWN THERE WAS NO ONE WHO WOULD BUY HIS COW WELL WELL NEVER MIND SAID GUDBRAND
3137-163504-0007 AND THE ROAD IS NO FARTHER OUT THAN IN AND WITH THAT HE BEGAN TO TODDLE HOME WITH HIS COW BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE A BIT OF THE WAY A MAN MET HIM WHO HAD A HORSE TO SELL SO GUDBRAND THOUGHT TWAS BETTER TO HAVE A HORSE THAN A COW SO HE SWOPPED WITH THE MAN
3137-163504-0008 A LITTLE FARTHER ON HE MET A MAN WALKING ALONG AND DRIVING A FAT PIG BEFORE HIM AND HE THOUGHT IT BETTER TO HAVE A FAT PIG THAN A HORSE SO HE SWOPPED WITH THE MAN AFTER THAT HE WENT A LITTLE FARTHER AND A MAN MET HIM WITH A GOAT
3137-163504-0009 FOR HE THOUGHT IT ALWAYS BETTER TO HAVE A SHEEP THAN A GOAT AFTER A WHILE HE MET A MAN WITH A GOOSE AND HE SWOPPED AWAY THE SHEEP FOR THE GOOSE AND WHEN HE HAD WALKED A LONG LONG TIME
