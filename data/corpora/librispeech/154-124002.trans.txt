154-124002-0000 AT THE TIME WHEN HE IS CONSTRUCTING HIS PLOTS AND ENGAGED ON THE DICTION IN WHICH THEY ARE WORKED OUT THE POET SHOULD REMEMBER ONE TO PUT THE ACTUAL SCENES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE BEFORE HIS EYES
154-124002-0001 IN THIS WAY SEEING EVERYTHING WITH THE VIVIDNESS OF AN EYE WITNESS AS IT WERE HE WILL DEVISE WHAT IS APPROPRIATE AND BE LEAST LIKELY TO OVERLOOK INCONGRUITIES THIS IS SHOWN BY WHAT WAS CENSURED IN
154-124002-0002 AS FAR AS MAY BE TOO THE POET SHOULD EVEN ACT HIS STORY WITH THE VERY GESTURES OF HIS PERSONAGES GIVEN THE SAME NATURAL QUALIFICATIONS HE WHO FEELS THE EMOTIONS TO BE DESCRIBED WILL BE THE MOST CONVINCING
154-124002-0003 BEFORE PROCEEDING TO LENGTHEN IT OUT BY THE INSERTION OF EPISODES THE FOLLOWING WILL SHOW HOW THE UNIVERSAL ELEMENT IN IPHIGENIA FOR INSTANCE MAY BE VIEWED A CERTAIN MAIDEN
154-124002-0004 HAVING BEEN OFFERED IN SACRIFICE AND SPIRITED AWAY FROM HER SACRIFICERS INTO ANOTHER LAND WHERE THE CUSTOM WAS TO SACRIFICE ALL STRANGERS TO THE GODDESS SHE WAS MADE THERE THE PRIESTESS OF THIS RITE
154-124002-0005 LONG AFTER THAT THE BROTHER OF THE PRIESTESS HAPPENED TO COME THE FACT HOWEVER OF THE ORACLE HAVING FOR A CERTAIN REASON BIDDEN HIM GO THITHER AND HIS OBJECT IN GOING ARE OUTSIDE THE PLOT OF THE PLAY
154-124002-0006 ON HIS COMING HE WAS ARRESTED AND ABOUT TO BE SACRIFICED WHEN HE REVEALED WHO HE WAS
154-124002-0007 SO I TOO AM DOOMED TO BE SACRIFICED AS MY SISTER WAS AND THE DISCLOSURE LED TO HIS SALVATION THIS DONE THE NEXT THING AFTER THE PROPER NAMES HAVE BEEN FIXED AS A BASIS FOR THE STORY
154-124002-0008 IS TO WORK IN EPISODES OR ACCESSORY INCIDENTS ONE MUST MIND HOWEVER THAT THE EPISODES ARE APPROPRIATE LIKE THE FIT OF MADNESS IN ORESTES WHICH LED TO HIS ARREST AND THE PURIFYING WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT HIS SALVATION
154-124002-0009 A CERTAIN MAN HAS BEEN ABROAD MANY YEARS POSEIDON IS EVER ON THE WATCH FOR HIM AND HE IS ALL ALONE MATTERS AT HOME TOO HAVE COME TO THIS THAT HIS SUBSTANCE IS BEING WASTED
154-124002-0010 AND HIS SON'S DEATH PLOTTED BY SUITORS TO HIS WIFE THEN HE ARRIVES THERE HIMSELF AFTER HIS GRIEVOUS SUFFERINGS REVEALS HIMSELF AND FALLS ON HIS ENEMIES AND THE END IS HIS SALVATION AND THEIR DEATH
154-124002-0011 THIS BEING ALL THAT IS PROPER TO THE ODYSSEY EVERYTHING ELSE IN IT IS EPISODE
154-124002-0012 CERTAIN ALSO OF THOSE WITHIN THE PLAY FORMING THE COMPLICATION AND THE REST THE DENOUEMENT BY COMPLICATION I MEAN ALL FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY TO THE POINT JUST BEFORE THE CHANGE IN THE HERO'S FORTUNES BY
154-124002-0013 OR NOT THE SAME AS ANOTHER TO DO SO ON THE GROUND BEFORE ALL ELSE OF THEIR PLOT
154-124002-0014 DENOUEMENT YET THERE ARE MANY DRAMATISTS WHO AFTER A GOOD COMPLICATION FAIL IN THE DENOUEMENT BUT IT IS NECESSARY FOR BOTH POINTS OF CONSTRUCTION TO BE ALWAYS DULY MASTERED
154-124002-0015 THE FOURTH CONSTITUENT IS THAT OF SPECTACLE EXEMPLIFIED IN THE
154-124002-0016 THE POET'S AIM THEN SHOULD BE TO COMBINE EVERY ELEMENT OF INTEREST IF POSSIBLE OR ELSE THE MORE IMPORTANT AND THE MAJOR PART OF THEM THIS IS NOW ESPECIALLY NECESSARY OWING TO THE UNFAIR CRITICISM TO WHICH THE POET IS SUBJECTED IN THESE DAYS
154-124002-0017 ONE SHOULD ALSO REMEMBER WHAT HAS BEEN SAID MORE THAN ONCE AND NOT WRITE A TRAGEDY ON AN EPIC BODY OF INCIDENT
154-124002-0018 BY ATTEMPTING TO DRAMATIZE FOR INSTANCE THE ENTIRE STORY OF THE ILIAD IN THE EPIC OWING TO ITS SCALE EVERY PART IS TREATED AT PROPER LENGTH WITH A DRAMA HOWEVER ON THE SAME STORY THE RESULT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING
154-124002-0019 EITHER FAIL UTTERLY OR HAVE BUT ILL SUCCESS ON THE STAGE
154-124002-0020 YET IN THEIR PERIPETIES AS ALSO IN THEIR SIMPLE PLOTS THE POETS I MEAN SHOW WONDERFUL SKILL IN AIMING AT THE KIND OF EFFECT THEY DESIRE A TRAGIC SITUATION THAT AROUSES THE HUMAN FEELING IN ONE LIKE THE CLEVER VILLAIN
154-124002-0021 THE TURNS GIVEN TO THE LANGUAGE WHEN SPOKEN
154-124002-0022 WHETHER THE POET KNOWS THESE THINGS OR NOT HIS ART AS A POET IS NEVER SERIOUSLY CRITICIZED ON THAT ACCOUNT
154-124002-0023 WHICH PROTAGORAS HAS CRITICIZED AS BEING A COMMAND WHERE A PRAYER WAS MEANT SINCE TO BID ONE DO OR NOT DO HE TELLS US IS A COMMAND
