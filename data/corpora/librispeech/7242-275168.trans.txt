7242-275168-0012 THE NEAREST HOTEL TO THE TERMINUS WOULD OFFER THEM ACCOMMODATION FOR THAT NIGHT ON THE NEXT DAY THEY COULD FIND SOME QUIET PLACE IN THE COUNTRY NO MATTER WHERE SO LONG AS THEY WERE NOT DISTURBED
7242-275168-0013 GIVE ME REST AND PEACE AND MY MIND WILL BE EASIER CATHERINE SAID LET NOBODY KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME THESE CONDITIONS WERE STRICTLY OBSERVED WITH AN EXCEPTION IN FAVOR OF MISTER SARRAZIN
7242-275168-0014 WHILE HIS CLIENT'S PECUNIARY AFFAIRS WERE STILL UNSETTLED THE LAWYER HAD HIS CLAIM TO BE TAKEN INTO HER CONFIDENCE
7242-275168-0015 THE STATE OF HIS MIND PRESENTED A COMPLETE CONTRAST TO THE STATE OF CATHERINE'S MIND SO FAR FROM SHARING HER AVERSION TO THE PERSONAL ASSOCIATIONS
7242-275168-0016 WHICH WERE CONNECTED WITH THE HOTEL HE FOUND HIS ONE CONSOLATION IN VISITING THE SCENES WHICH REMINDED HIM OF THE BELOVED WOMAN WHOM HE HAD LOST THE REASON FOR THIS WAS NOT FAR TO SEEK HIS WAS THE LARGEST NATURE
7242-275168-0017 AND HIS HAD BEEN THE MOST DEVOTED LOVE AS USUAL HIS LETTERS WERE FORWARDED TO HIM FROM HIS PLACE OF RESIDENCE IN LONDON
7242-275168-0018 THE OTHERS HE TOOK OUT WITH HIM TO THAT SEQUESTERED PART OF THE GARDEN IN WHICH HE HAD PASSED THE HAPPIEST HOURS OF HIS LIFE BY CATHERINE'S SIDE
7242-275168-0019 HE WAS THINKING OF HER NOW HIS BETTER JUDGMENT PROTESTED HIS ACCUSING CONSCIENCE WARNED HIM THAT HE WAS COMMITTING NOT ONLY AN ACT OF FOLLY BUT WITH HIS RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS
7242-275168-0020 AN ACT OF SIN AND STILL SHE HELD HER PLACE IN HIS THOUGHTS THE MANAGER HAD TOLD HIM OF HER SUDDEN DEPARTURE FROM THE HOTEL
7242-275168-0021 THAT THE PLACE OF HER DESTINATION HAD NOT BEEN COMMUNICATED TO HIM ASKED IF SHE HAD LEFT NO DIRECTIONS RELATING TO HER CORRESPONDENCE HE HAD REPLIED THAT HIS INSTRUCTIONS WERE TO FORWARD ALL LETTERS TO HER LAWYER
7242-275168-0022 ON THE POINT OF INQUIRING NEXT FOR THE NAME AND ADDRESS BENNYDECK'S SENSE OF DUTY AND SENSE OF SHAME ROUSED AT LAST FILLED HIM WITH A TIMELY CONTEMPT FOR HIMSELF IN FEELING TEMPTED TO WRITE TO CATHERINE
7242-275168-0023 IN ENCOURAGING FOND THOUGHTS OF HER AMONG SCENES WHICH KEPT HER IN HIS MEMORY
7242-275168-0024 SHE HAD SET HIM THE RIGHT EXAMPLE
7242-275168-0025 IN LEAVING THE PLACE BEFORE HE COULD FALTER IN HIS RESOLUTION HE GAVE NOTICE OF HIS DEPARTURE THE ONE HOPE FOR HIM NOW WAS TO FIND A REFUGE FROM HIMSELF IN ACTS OF MERCY
7242-275168-0026 CONSOLATION WAS PERHAPS WAITING FOR HIM IN HIS HOME HIS UNOPENED CORRESPONDENCE OFFERED A HARMLESS OCCUPATION TO HIS THOUGHTS IN THE MEANWHILE ONE AFTER ANOTHER HE READ THE LETTERS
7242-275168-0027 WITH AN ATTENTION CONSTANTLY WANDERING AND CONSTANTLY RECALLED UNTIL HE OPENED THE LAST OF THEM THAT REMAINED IN A MOMENT MORE HIS INTEREST WAS ABSORBED THE FIRST SENTENCES IN THE LETTER TOLD HIM
7242-275168-0028 THAT THE DESERTED CREATURE WHOM HE HAD MET IN THE GARDEN THE STRANGER TO WHOM HE HAD OFFERED HELP AND CONSOLATION IN THE PRESENT AND IN THE FUTURE WAS NO OTHER THAN THE LOST GIRL
7242-275168-0029 OF WHOM HE HAD BEEN SO LONG IN SEARCH THE DAUGHTER OF RODERICK WESTERFIELD ONCE HIS DEAREST AND OLDEST FRIEND IN THE PAGES THAT FOLLOWED
7242-275168-0030 THE WRITER CONFIDED TO HIM HER SAD STORY LEAVING IT TO HER FATHER'S FRIEND TO DECIDE WHETHER SHE WAS WORTHY OF THE SYMPATHY WHICH HE HAD OFFERED TO HER WHEN HE THOUGHT SHE WAS A STRANGER
7242-275168-0031 THIS PART OF HER LETTER WAS NECESSARILY A REPETITION OF WHAT BENNYDECK HAD READ IN THE CONFESSION
7242-275168-0032 THAT GENEROUS WOMAN HAD BEEN GUILTY OF ONE AND BUT ONE CONCEALMENT OF THE TRUTH IN RELATING THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE ELOPEMENT FROM MOUNT MORVEN HAD TAKEN PLACE SHE HAD ABSTAINED
7242-275168-0033 IN JUSTICE TO THE SINCERITY OF SYDNEY'S REPENTANCE FROM MENTIONING SYDNEY'S NAME ANOTHER INSTANCE THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT BITTERLY AS HE CLOSED THE LETTER
7242-275168-0034 OF THE VIRTUES WHICH MIGHT HAVE MADE THE HAPPINESS OF MY LIFE BUT HE WAS BOUND TO REMEMBER AND HE DID REMEMBER THAT THERE WAS NOW A NEW INTEREST TENDERLY ASSOCIATING ITSELF WITH HIS LIFE TO COME
7242-275168-0035 THE ONE BEST WAY OF TELLING SYDNEY HOW DEAR SHE WAS TO HIM ALREADY FOR HER FATHER'S SAKE WOULD BE TO ANSWER HER IN PERSON HE HURRIED AWAY TO LONDON BY THE FIRST TRAIN
7242-275168-0036 AND DROVE AT ONCE TO RANDAL'S PLACE OF ABODE TO ASK FOR SYDNEY'S ADDRESS WONDERING WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE POSTSCRIPT TO HIS LETTER WHICH HAD GIVEN BENNYDECK THE INFORMATION OF WHICH HE WAS NOW IN SEARCH
7242-275168-0037 RANDAL COMPLIED WITH HIS FRIEND'S REQUEST AND THEN VENTURED TO ALLUDE TO THE REPORT OF THE CAPTAIN'S MARRIAGE ENGAGEMENT AM I TO CONGRATULATE YOU HE ASKED
7242-275168-0038 CONGRATULATE ME ON HAVING DISCOVERED RODERICK WESTERFIELD'S DAUGHTER THAT REPLY AND THE TONE IN WHICH IT WAS GIVEN LED RANDAL TO ASK IF THE ENGAGEMENT HAD BEEN PREMATURELY ANNOUNCED
7242-275168-0039 THERE IS NO ENGAGEMENT AT ALL BENNYDECK ANSWERED WITH A LOOK WHICH SUGGESTED THAT IT MIGHT BE WISE NOT TO DWELL ON THE SUBJECT BUT THE DISCOVERY WAS WELCOME TO RANDAL FOR HIS BROTHER'S SAKE
7242-275168-0040 HE RAN THE RISK OF CONSEQUENCES AND INQUIRED IF CATHERINE WAS STILL TO BE FOUND AT THE HOTEL THE CAPTAIN ANSWERED BY A SIGN IN THE NEGATIVE RANDAL PERSISTED DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE HAS GONE
7242-275168-0041 NOBODY KNOWS BUT HER LAWYER IN THAT CASE RANDAL CONCLUDED I SHALL GET THE INFORMATION THAT I WANT NOTICING THAT BENNYDECK LOOKED SURPRISED HE MENTIONED HIS MOTIVE
7242-275168-0042 HERBERT IS PINING TO SEE KITTY HE CONTINUED AND I MEAN TO HELP HIM
7242-275168-0043 AS THINGS ARE I BELIEVE I SHALL NOT OFFEND CATHERINE IF I ARRANGE FOR A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD WHAT DO YOU SAY BENNYDECK ANSWERED
