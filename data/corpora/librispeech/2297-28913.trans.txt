2297-28913-0000 PERHAPS HE DID NOT TAKE MUCH DELIGHT IN THEM HE WAS NO DOUBT IMPATIENT TO COMMENCE THAT STEADY MARRIED LIFE FOR WHICH HE HAD PREPARED HIMSELF BUT NEVERTHELESS JUST AT PRESENT HE LIVED A GOOD DEAL AT THE BEARGARDEN WHERE WAS HE TO LIVE THE BONCASSENS WERE IN PARIS
2297-28913-0001 HIS SISTER WAS AT MATCHING WITH A HOUSEFUL OF OTHER PALLISERS AND HIS FATHER WAS AGAIN DEEP IN POLITICS OF COURSE HE WAS MUCH IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS BUT THAT ALSO WAS STUPID INDEED EVERYTHING WOULD BE STUPID TILL ISABEL CAME BACK
2297-28913-0002 PERHAPS DINNER WAS MORE COMFORTABLE AT THE CLUB THAN AT THE HOUSE AND THEN AS EVERYBODY KNEW IT WAS A GOOD THING TO CHANGE THE SCENE THEREFORE HE DINED AT THE CLUB
2297-28913-0003 HE SPENT MANY LONG HOURS AT THE BEARGARDEN THERE'LL VERY SOON BE AN END OF THIS AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED
2297-28913-0004 HE WROTE TO ME AND I ANSWERED HIM AS YOU KNOW BUT WHITHER HE VANISHED OR WHAT HE IS DOING OR HOW HE IS LIVING I HAVE NOT THE LEAST IDEA GONE TO JOIN THOSE OTHER FELLOWS ABROAD I SHOULD SAY
2297-28913-0005 AMONG THEM THEY GOT A LOT OF MONEY AS THE DUKE OUGHT TO REMEMBER HE IS NOT WITH THEM SAID SILVERBRIDGE AS THOUGH HE WERE IN SOME DEGREE MOURNING OVER THE FATE OF HIS UNFORTUNATE FRIEND I SUPPOSE CAPTAIN GREEN WAS THE LEADER IN ALL THAT
2297-28913-0006 HE WAS TRUE TO ME TILL HE THOUGHT I SNUBBED HIM I WOULD NOT LET HIM GO DOWN TO SILVERBRIDGE WITH ME I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT I DROVE THE POOR MAJOR TO HIS MALPRACTICES AT THIS MOMENT DOLLY LONGSTAFF SAUNTERED INTO THE ROOM AND CAME UP TO THEM
2297-28913-0007 IT MAY BE REMEMBERED THAT DOLLY HAD DECLARED HIS PURPOSE OF EMIGRATING AS SOON AS HE HEARD THAT THE DUKE'S HEIR HAD SERIOUS THOUGHTS OF MARRYING THE LADY WHOM HE LOVED HE WITHDREW AT ONCE FROM THE CONTEST
2297-28913-0008 BUT AS HE DID SO HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE COULD BE NO LONGER A HOME FOR HIM IN THE COUNTRY WHICH ISABEL WAS TO INHABIT AS THE WIFE OF ANOTHER MAN GRADUALLY HOWEVER BETTER THOUGHTS RETURNED TO HIM AFTER ALL WHAT WAS SHE BUT A PERT POPPET
2297-28913-0009 HE DETERMINED THAT MARRIAGE CLIPS A FELLOW'S WINGS CONFOUNDEDLY AND SO HE SET HIMSELF TO ENJOY LIFE AFTER HIS OLD FASHION THERE WAS PERHAPS A LITTLE SWAGGER AS HE THREW HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR AND ADDRESSED THE HAPPY LOVER
2297-28913-0010 TIFTO YES TIFTO
2297-28913-0011 A SHABBY HAT AND OLD GLOVES DID HE SPEAK TO YOU ASKED SILVERBRIDGE NO NOR I TO HIM
2297-28913-0012 NOTHING FURTHER WAS SAID ABOUT THE MAN BUT SILVERBRIDGE WAS UNEASY AND SILENT WHEN HIS CIGAR WAS FINISHED HE GOT UP SAYING THAT HE SHOULD GO BACK TO THE HOUSE AS HE LEFT THE CLUB HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM AS THOUGH EXPECTING TO SEE HIS OLD FRIEND
2297-28913-0013 AND WHEN HE HAD PASSED THROUGH THE FIRST STREET AND HAD GOT INTO THE HAYMARKET THERE HE WAS THE MAJOR CAME UP TO HIM TOUCHED HIS HAT ASKED TO BE ALLOWED TO SAY A FEW WORDS I DON'T THINK IT CAN DO ANY GOOD SAID SILVERBRIDGE
2297-28913-0014 BUT SEEMED TO BE THOROUGHLY HUMILIATED I DON'T THINK I CAN BE OF ANY SERVICE TO YOU AND THEREFORE I HAD RATHER DECLINE I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE OF ANY SERVICE MY LORD THEN WHAT'S THE GOOD
2297-28913-0015 I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY MAY I COME TO YOU TO MORROW THEN SILVERBRIDGE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT AND AN HOUR WAS NAMED AT WHICH TIFTO MIGHT CALL IN CARLTON TERRACE
2297-28913-0016 HE FELT THAT HE ALMOST OWED SOME REPARATION TO THE WRETCHED MAN WHOM HE HAD UNFORTUNATELY ADMITTED AMONG HIS FRIENDS WHOM HE HAD USED AND TO WHOM HE HAD BEEN UNCOURTEOUS EXACTLY AT THE HOUR NAMED THE MAJOR WAS SHOWN INTO HIS ROOM
2297-28913-0017 DOLLY HAD SAID THAT HE WAS SHABBY BUT THE MAN WAS ALTERED RATHER THAN SHABBY HE STILL HAD RINGS ON HIS FINGERS AND STUDS IN HIS SHIRT AND A JEWELLED PIN IN HIS CRAVAT BUT HE HAD SHAVEN OFF HIS MOUSTACHE AND THE TUFT FROM HIS CHIN
2297-28913-0018 AND IN SPITE OF HIS JEWELLERY THERE WAS A HANG DOG LOOK ABOUT HIM I'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT I PARTICULARLY WANT TO SAY TO YOU MY LORD SILVERBRIDGE WOULD NOT SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM BUT COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM OFFERING HIM A CHAIR WELL
