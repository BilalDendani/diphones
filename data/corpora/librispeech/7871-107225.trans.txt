7871-107225-0001 NOR TO HAVE GIVEN RISE AMONG THEM TO WILD SPECULATIONS THE MAP OF THE TENTH CENTURY IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM ACCOMPANYING THE PERIEGESIS OF PRISCIAN IS FAR MORE CORRECT THAN THE GENERALITY OF MAPS
7871-107225-0002 AND PARADISE DOES NOT OCCUPY THE PLACE OF COCHIN CHINA OR THE ISLES OF JAPAN AS IT DID LATER
7871-107225-0003 AND HAD BEEN SPECIFIED BY HIM AS OCCUPYING A CONTINENT EAST OF CHINA BEYOND THE OCEAN AND STILL WATERED BY THE FOUR GREAT RIVERS PISON
7871-107225-0004 IN FACT IS SITUATED IN THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE IT OCCUPIES THE SAME POSITION

7871-107225-0007 THERE TOO GROWS THE PLANT CALLED ASBETOS
7871-107225-0008 FROM HOUR TO HOUR AND DAY BY DAY THE TASTE OF THIS FOUNTAIN VARIES AND ITS SOURCE IS HARDLY THREE DAYS JOURNEY FROM PARADISE FROM WHICH ADAM WAS EXPELLED IF ANY MAN DRINKS THRICE OF THIS SPRING
7871-107225-0009 HE WILL FROM THAT DAY FEEL NO INFIRMITY AND HE WILL AS LONG AS HE LIVES APPEAR OF THE AGE OF THIRTY
7871-107225-0010 THIS OLYMPUS IS A CORRUPTION OF ALUMBO WHICH IS NO OTHER THAN COLUMBO IN CEYLON AS IS ABUNDANTLY EVIDENT FROM SIR JOHN MANDEVILLE'S TRAVELS THOUGH THIS IMPORTANT FOUNTAIN
7871-107225-0011 HAS ESCAPED THE OBSERVATION OF SIR EMMERSON TENNANT
7871-107225-0012 TOWARD THE HEED OF THAT FOREST HE WRITES
7871-107225-0013 AND AT THE FOOT OF THAT MOUNT
7871-107225-0014 IN AN UNAPPROACHABLE REGION OF ASIA SURROUNDED BY FLAMES AND HAVING AN ARMED ANGEL TO GUARD THE ONLY GATE LAMBERTUS FLORIDUS
7871-107225-0015 PRESERVED IN THE IMPERIAL LIBRARY IN PARIS DESCRIBES IT AS
7871-107225-0016 PARADISE IS REPRESENTED AS AN ISLAND A LITTLE SOUTH EAST OF ASIA SURROUNDED BY RAYS AND AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE MAIN LAND
7871-107225-0017 CLOSE TO THIS FOUNTAIN IS THE TREE OF LIFE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE COUNTRY IS EQUABLE NEITHER FROSTS NOR BURNING HEATS DESTROY THE VEGETATION THE FOUR RIVERS ALREADY MENTIONED RISE IN IT
7871-107225-0018 PARADISE IS HOWEVER INACCESSIBLE TO THE TRAVELLER ON ACCOUNT OF THE WALL OF FIRE WHICH SURROUNDS IT PALUDANUS
7871-107225-0019 OF COURSE ON INCONTROVERTIBLE AUTHORITY THAT ALEXANDER THE GREAT WAS FULL OF DESIRE TO SEE THE TERRESTRIAL PARADISE AND THAT HE UNDERTOOK HIS WARS IN
7871-107225-0020 AND OBTAINING ADMISSION INTO IT HE STATES THAT ON HIS NEARING EDEN
7871-107225-0021 AND THEY WERE ABOUT TO CONDUCT HIM TO THEIR MONARCH WHEN THE VENERABLE MAN SAID
7871-107225-0022 GO AND ANNOUNCE TO ALEXANDER THAT IT IS IN VAIN HE SEEKS PARADISE HIS EFFORTS WILL BE PERFECTLY FRUITLESS FOR THE WAY OF PARADISE IS THE WAY OF HUMILITY A WAY
7871-107225-0023 OF WHICH HE KNOWS NOTHING TAKE THIS STONE AND GIVE IT TO ALEXANDER AND SAY TO HIM FROM THIS STONE LEARN WHAT YOU MUST THINK OF YOURSELF
7871-107225-0024 NOW THIS STONE WAS OF GREAT VALUE AND EXCESSIVELY HEAVY OUTWEIGHING AND EXCELLING IN VALUE ALL OTHER GEMS BUT WHEN REDUCED TO POWDER IT WAS AS LIGHT AS A TUFT OF HAY
7871-107225-0025 IN HIS BOOK DE SITU TERRARUM EXPRESSES HIMSELF THUS
7871-107225-0026 PARADISE IS A SPOT IN THE ORIENT PRODUCTIVE OF ALL KIND OF WOODS AND POMIFEROUS TREES IT CONTAINS THE TREE OF LIFE THERE IS NEITHER COLD NOR HEAT THERE BUT PERPETUAL EQUABLE TEMPERATURE
7871-107225-0027 IT CONTAINS A FOUNTAIN WHICH FLOWS FORTH IN FOUR RIVERS
7871-107225-0028 MANY FOLK WANT TO MAKE OUT THAT THE SITE OF PARADISE IS IN THE EAST OF THE EARTH THOUGH CUT OFF BY THE LONGEST INTERVENING SPACE OF OCEAN OR EARTH FROM ALL REGIONS WHICH MAN NOW INHABITS CONSEQUENTLY THE WATERS OF THE DELUGE
7871-107225-0029 WHICH COVERED THE HIGHEST POINTS OF THE SURFACE OF OUR ORB WERE UNABLE TO REACH IT HOWEVER WHETHER IT BE THERE OR WHETHER IT BE ANYWHERE ELSE GOD KNOWS BUT THAT THERE WAS SUCH A SPOT ONCE AND THAT IT WAS ON EARTH THAT IS CERTAIN

7871-107225-0035 THAT HE WOULD EXPLORE THE FABULOUS DEATHLESS LAND OF PAGAN SCANDINAVIAN MYTHOLOGY
7871-107225-0036 THE STORY PURPORTS TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN A RELIGIOUS NOVEL BUT ONE AUDACIOUS COPYIST HAS VENTURED TO ASSERT THAT IT IS ALL FACT
7871-107225-0037 KING OF DRONTHEIM AND HAVING TAKEN UPON HIM A VOW TO EXPLORE THE DEATHLESS LAND HE WENT TO DENMARK WHERE HE PICKED UP A FRIEND OF THE SAME NAME AS HIMSELF THEY THEN WENT TO CONSTANTINOPLE AND CALLED UPON THE EMPEROR
7871-107225-0038 WHO HELD A LONG CONVERSATION WITH THEM
7871-107225-0039 RELATIVE TO THE TRUTHS OF CHRISTIANITY
7871-107225-0040 NOR LESS THAN PARADISE THE WORLD SAID THE MONARCH WHO HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HIS GEOGRAPHY SINCE HE LEFT SCHOOL IS PRECISELY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND STAGES ROUND ABOUT ONE MILLION ENGLISH MILES
7871-107225-0041 NOT A BIT IT IS SUPPORTED BY THE POWER OF GOD AND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN EARTH AND HEAVEN IS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND FORTY FIVE MILES
7871-107225-0042 AND ROUND ABOUT THE EARTH IS A BIG SEA CALLED OCEAN AND WHAT'S TO THE SOUTH OF THE EARTH ASKED EIREK O THERE IS THE END OF THE WORLD AND THAT IS INDIA
7871-107225-0043 AND PRAY WHERE AM I TO FIND THE DEATHLESS LAND THAT LIES PARADISE I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN WELL IT LIES SLIGHTLY EAST OF INDIA HAVING OBTAINED THIS INFORMATION THE TWO EIREKS STARTED
7871-107225-0044 FURNISHED WITH LETTERS FROM THE GREEK EMPEROR THEY TRAVERSED SYRIA AND TOOK SHIP
7871-107225-0045 THEN REACHING INDIA THEY PROCEEDED ON THEIR JOURNEY ON HORSEBACK TILL THEY CAME TO A DENSE FOREST THE GLOOM OF WHICH WAS SO GREAT THROUGH THE INTERLACING OF THE BOUGHS THAT EVEN BY DAY THE STARS COULD BE OBSERVED TWINKLING
7871-107225-0046 AS THOUGH THEY WERE SEEN FROM THE BOTTOM OF A WELL ON EMERGING FROM THE FOREST THE TWO EIREKS CAME UPON A STRAIT SEPARATING THEM FROM A BEAUTIFUL LAND WHICH WAS UNMISTAKABLY PARADISE
7871-107225-0047 INTENT ON DISPLAYING HIS SCRIPTURAL KNOWLEDGE PRONOUNCED THE STRAIT TO BE THE RIVER PISON THIS WAS CROSSED BY A STONE BRIDGE GUARDED BY A DRAGON THE DANISH EIREK DETERRED BY THE PROSPECT OF AN ENCOUNTER WITH THIS MONSTER
7871-107225-0048 SWORD IN HAND INTO THE MAW OF THE DRAGON AND NEXT MOMENT TO HIS INFINITE SURPRISE AND DELIGHT FOUND HIMSELF LIBERATED FROM THE GLOOM OF THE MONSTER'S INTERIOR AND SAFELY PLACED IN PARADISE
7871-107225-0049 THE LAND WAS MOST BEAUTIFUL AND THE GRASS AS GORGEOUS AS PURPLE IT WAS STUDDED WITH FLOWERS AND WAS TRAVERSED BY HONEY RILLS THE LAND WAS EXTENSIVE AND LEVEL SO THAT THERE WAS NOT TO BE SEEN MOUNTAIN OR HILL
7871-107225-0050 AND THE SUN SHONE CLOUDLESS WITHOUT NIGHT AND DARKNESS THE CALM OF THE AIR WAS GREAT AND THERE WAS BUT A FEEBLE MURMUR OF WIND AND THAT WHICH THERE WAS BREATHED REDOLENT WITH THE ODOR OF BLOSSOMS
7871-107225-0051 AFTER A SHORT WALK EIREK OBSERVED WHAT CERTAINLY MUST HAVE BEEN A REMARKABLE OBJECT NAMELY A TOWER OR STEEPLE SELF SUSPENDED IN THE AIR WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT WHATEVER
7871-107225-0052 THOUGH ACCESS MIGHT BE HAD TO IT BY MEANS OF A SLENDER LADDER BY THIS EIREK ASCENDED INTO A LOFT OF THE TOWER AND FOUND THERE AN EXCELLENT COLD COLLATION PREPARED FOR HIM AFTER HAVING PARTAKEN OF THIS HE WENT TO SLEEP
7871-107225-0053 AND IN VISION BEHELD AND CONVERSED WITH HIS GUARDIAN ANGEL WHO PROMISED TO CONDUCT HIM BACK TO HIS FATHERLAND BUT TO COME FOR HIM AGAIN AND FETCH HIM AWAY FROM IT FOREVER
7871-107225-0054 AND INDEED WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN NOTWITHSTANDING HIS LOOKS BUT A HARMLESS AND PASSIVE DRAGON
7871-107225-0055 EIREK REACHED HIS NATIVE LAND WHERE HE RELATED HIS ADVENTURES
7871-107225-0056 AND TO THE DELIGHT AND EDIFICATION OF THE FAITHFUL
