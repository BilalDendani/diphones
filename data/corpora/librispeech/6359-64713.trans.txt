6359-64713-0000 GENIE SAID ALADDIN BUILD ME A PALACE FIT TO RECEIVE THE PRINCESS BUDDIR AL BUDDOOR LET ITS MATERIALS BE MADE OF NOTHING LESS THAN PORPHYRY JASPER AGATE LAPIS LAZULI AND THE FINEST MARBLE
6359-64713-0001 LET ITS WALLS BE MASSIVE GOLD AND SILVER BRICKS LAID ALTERNATELY LET EACH FRONT CONTAIN SIX WINDOWS AND LET THE LATTICES OF THESE EXCEPT ONE WHICH MUST BE LEFT UNFINISHED BE ENRICHED WITH DIAMONDS
6359-64713-0002 RUBIES AND EMERALDS SO THAT THEY SHALL EXCEED EVERYTHING OF THE KIND EVER SEEN IN THE WORLD LET THERE BE AN INNER AND OUTER COURT IN FRONT OF THE PALACE AND A SPACIOUS GARDEN BUT ABOVE ALL THINGS PROVIDE A SAFE TREASURE HOUSE
6359-64713-0003 AND FILL IT WITH GOLD AND SILVER LET THERE BE ALSO KITCHENS AND STOREHOUSES STABLES FULL OF THE FINEST HORSES WITH THEIR EQUERRIES AND GROOMS AND HUNTING EQUIPAGE OFFICERS ATTENDANTS AND SLAVES BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
6359-64713-0004 TO FORM A RETINUE FOR THE PRINCESS AND MYSELF GO AND EXECUTE MY WISHES WHEN ALADDIN GAVE THESE COMMANDS TO THE GENIE THE SUN WAS SET THE NEXT MORNING AT DAYBREAK THE GENIE PRESENTED HIMSELF
6359-64713-0005 AND HAVING OBTAINED ALADDIN'S CONSENT TRANSPORTED HIM IN A MOMENT TO THE PALACE HE HAD MADE THE GENIE LED HIM THROUGH ALL THE APARTMENTS WHERE HE FOUND OFFICERS AND SLAVES HABITED ACCORDING TO THEIR RANK AND THE SERVICES TO WHICH THEY WERE APPOINTED
6359-64713-0006 THE GENIE THEN SHOWED HIM THE TREASURY WHICH WAS OPENED BY A TREASURER WHERE ALADDIN SAW LARGE VASES OF DIFFERENT SIZES PILED UP TO THE TOP WITH MONEY RANGED ALL ROUND THE CHAMBER THE GENIE THENCE LED HIM TO THE STABLES
6359-64713-0007 AND THE GROOMS BUSY IN DRESSING THEM FROM THENCE THEY WENT TO THE STOREHOUSES WHICH WERE FILLED WITH ALL THINGS NECESSARY BOTH FOR FOOD AND ORNAMENT WHEN ALADDIN HAD EXAMINED EVERY PORTION OF THE PALACE
6359-64713-0008 AND PARTICULARLY THE HALL WITH THE FOUR AND TWENTY WINDOWS AND FOUND IT FAR TO EXCEED HIS FONDEST EXPECTATIONS HE SAID GENIE THERE IS ONE THING WANTING A FINE CARPET FOR THE PRINCESS TO WALK UPON FROM THE SULTAN'S PALACE TO MINE
6359-64713-0009 LAY ONE DOWN IMMEDIATELY THE GENIE DISAPPEARED AND ALADDIN SAW WHAT HE DESIRED EXECUTED IN AN INSTANT THE GENIE THEN RETURNED AND CARRIED HIM TO HIS OWN HOME
6359-64713-0010 WHEN THE SULTAN'S PORTERS CAME TO OPEN THE GATES THEY WERE AMAZED TO FIND WHAT HAD BEEN AN UNOCCUPIED GARDEN FILLED UP WITH A MAGNIFICENT PALACE AND A SPLENDID CARPET EXTENDING TO IT ALL THE WAY FROM THE SULTAN'S PALACE
6359-64713-0011 THEY TOLD THE STRANGE TIDINGS TO THE GRAND VIZIER WHO INFORMED THE SULTAN WHO EXCLAIMED IT MUST BE ALADDIN'S PALACE WHICH I GAVE HIM LEAVE TO BUILD FOR MY DAUGHTER HE HAS WISHED TO SURPRISE US AND LET US SEE
6359-64713-0012 WHAT WONDERS CAN BE DONE IN ONLY ONE NIGHT ALADDIN ON HIS BEING CONVEYED BY THE GENIE TO HIS OWN HOME REQUESTED HIS MOTHER TO GO TO THE PRINCESS BUDDIR AL BUDDOOR AND TELL HER THAT THE PALACE WOULD BE READY FOR HER RECEPTION IN THE EVENING SHE WENT
6359-64713-0013 ATTENDED BY HER WOMEN SLAVES IN THE SAME ORDER AS ON THE PRECEDING DAY SHORTLY AFTER HER ARRIVAL AT THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENT THE SULTAN HIMSELF CAME IN AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND HER
6359-64713-0014 WHOM HE KNEW AS HIS SUPPLIANT AT HIS DIVAN IN SUCH HUMBLE GUISE TO BE NOW MORE RICHLY AND SUMPTUOUSLY ATTIRED THAN HIS OWN DAUGHTER THIS GAVE HIM A HIGHER OPINION OF ALADDIN WHO TOOK SUCH CARE OF HIS MOTHER AND MADE HER SHARE HIS WEALTH AND HONOURS
6359-64713-0015 SHORTLY AFTER HER DEPARTURE ALADDIN MOUNTING HIS HORSE AND ATTENDED BY HIS RETINUE OF MAGNIFICENT ATTENDANTS LEFT HIS PATERNAL HOME FOREVER AND WENT TO THE PALACE IN THE SAME POMP AS ON THE DAY BEFORE NOR DID HE FORGET TO TAKE WITH HIM THE WONDERFUL LAMP
6359-64713-0016 AND AT NIGHT ON THE CONCLUSION OF THE MARRIAGE CEREMONIES THE PRINCESS TOOK LEAVE OF THE SULTAN HER FATHER BANDS OF MUSIC LED THE PROCESSION FOLLOWED BY A HUNDRED STATE USHERS AND THE LIKE NUMBER OF BLACK MUTES IN TWO FILES WITH THEIR OFFICERS AT THEIR HEAD
6359-64713-0017 MADE IT AS LIGHT AS DAY IN THIS ORDER THE PRINCESS CONVEYED IN HER LITTER AND ACCOMPANIED ALSO BY ALADDIN'S MOTHER CARRIED IN A SUPERB LITTER AND ATTENDED BY HER WOMEN SLAVES PROCEEDED ON THE CARPET WHICH WAS SPREAD FROM THE SULTAN'S PALACE TO THAT OF ALADDIN
6359-64713-0018 ON HER ARRIVAL ALADDIN WAS READY TO RECEIVE HER AT THE ENTRANCE AND LED HER INTO A LARGE HALL ILLUMINATED WITH AN INFINITE NUMBER OF WAX CANDLES WHERE A NOBLE FEAST WAS SERVED UP
6359-64713-0019 THE DISHES WERE OF MASSY GOLD AND CONTAINED THE MOST DELICATE VIANDS THE VASES BASINS AND GOBLETS WERE GOLD ALSO AND OF EXQUISITE WORKMANSHIP AND ALL THE OTHER ORNAMENTS AND EMBELLISHMENTS OF THE HALL WERE ANSWERABLE TO THIS DISPLAY
6359-64713-0020 THE PRINCESS DAZZLED TO SEE SO MUCH RICHES COLLECTED IN ONE PLACE SAID TO ALADDIN I THOUGHT PRINCE THAT NOTHING IN THE WORLD WAS SO BEAUTIFUL AS THE SULTAN MY FATHER'S PALACE BUT THE SIGHT OF THIS HALL ALONE
6359-64713-0021 IS SUFFICIENT TO SHOW I WAS DECEIVED WHEN THE SUPPER WAS ENDED THERE ENTERED A COMPANY OF FEMALE DANCERS WHO PERFORMED ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY SINGING AT THE SAME TIME VERSES IN PRAISE OF THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM ABOUT MIDNIGHT
6359-64713-0022 ALADDIN'S MOTHER CONDUCTED THE BRIDE TO THE NUPTIAL APARTMENT AND HE SOON AFTER RETIRED THE NEXT MORNING THE ATTENDANTS OF ALADDIN PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO DRESS HIM AND BROUGHT HIM ANOTHER HABIT AS RICH AND MAGNIFICENT AS THAT WORN THE DAY BEFORE
6359-64713-0023 HE THEN ORDERED ONE OF THE HORSES TO BE GOT READY MOUNTED HIM AND WENT IN THE MIDST OF A LARGE TROOP OF SLAVES TO THE SULTAN'S PALACE TO ENTREAT HIM TO TAKE A REPAST IN THE PRINCESS'S PALACE ATTENDED BY HIS GRAND VIZIER
6359-64713-0024 THE SULTAN CONSENTED WITH PLEASURE ROSE UP IMMEDIATELY AND PRECEDED BY THE PRINCIPAL OFFICERS OF HIS PALACE AND FOLLOWED BY ALL THE GREAT LORDS OF HIS COURT ACCOMPANIED ALADDIN THE NEARER THE SULTAN APPROACHED ALADDIN'S PALACE THE MORE HE WAS STRUCK WITH ITS BEAUTY
6359-64713-0025 BUT WHEN HE ENTERED IT CAME INTO THE HALL AND SAW THE WINDOWS ENRICHED WITH DIAMONDS RUBIES EMERALDS ALL LARGE PERFECT STONES HE WAS COMPLETELY SURPRISED AND SAID TO HIS SON IN LAW THIS PALACE IS ONE OF THE WONDERS OF THE WORLD
6359-64713-0026 FOR WHERE IN ALL THE WORLD BESIDES SHALL WE FIND WALLS BUILT OF MASSY GOLD AND SILVER AND DIAMONDS RUBIES AND EMERALDS COMPOSING THE WINDOWS BUT WHAT MOST SURPRISES ME IS
6359-64713-0027 THAT A HALL OF THIS MAGNIFICENCE SHOULD BE LEFT WITH ONE OF ITS WINDOWS INCOMPLETE AND UNFINISHED SIRE ANSWERED ALADDIN THE OMISSION WAS BY DESIGN SINCE I WISHED THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE THE GLORY OF FINISHING THIS HALL
6359-64713-0028 I TAKE YOUR INTENTION KINDLY SAID THE SULTAN AND WILL GIVE ORDERS ABOUT IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SULTAN HAD FINISHED THIS MAGNIFICENT ENTERTAINMENT PROVIDED FOR HIM AND FOR HIS COURT BY ALADDIN
6359-64713-0029 HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE JEWELLERS AND GOLDSMITHS ATTENDED UPON WHICH HE RETURNED TO THE HALL AND SHOWED THEM THE WINDOW WHICH WAS UNFINISHED I SENT FOR YOU SAID HE TO FIT UP THIS WINDOW IN AS GREAT PERFECTION AS THE REST
6359-64713-0030 EXAMINE THEM WELL AND MAKE ALL THE DISPATCH YOU CAN THE JEWELLERS AND GOLDSMITHS EXAMINED THE THREE AND TWENTY WINDOWS WITH GREAT ATTENTION
6359-64713-0031 AND PRESENTED THEMSELVES BEFORE THE SULTAN WHOSE PRINCIPAL JEWELLER UNDERTAKING TO SPEAK FOR THE REST SAID SIRE WE ARE ALL WILLING TO EXERT OUR UTMOST CARE AND INDUSTRY TO OBEY YOU
6359-64713-0032 BUT AMONG US ALL WE CANNOT FURNISH JEWELS ENOUGH FOR SO GREAT A WORK I HAVE MORE THAN ARE NECESSARY SAID THE SULTAN COME TO MY PALACE AND YOU SHALL CHOOSE WHAT MAY ANSWER YOUR PURPOSE
6359-64713-0033 WHEN THE SULTAN RETURNED TO HIS PALACE HE ORDERED HIS JEWELS TO BE BROUGHT OUT AND THE JEWELLERS TOOK A GREAT QUANTITY PARTICULARLY THOSE ALADDIN HAD MADE HIM A PRESENT OF WHICH THEY SOON USED WITHOUT MAKING ANY GREAT ADVANCE IN THEIR WORK
6359-64713-0034 THEY CAME AGAIN SEVERAL TIMES FOR MORE AND IN A MONTH'S TIME HAD NOT FINISHED HALF THEIR WORK IN SHORT THEY USED ALL THE JEWELS THE SULTAN HAD AND BORROWED OF THE VIZIER BUT YET THE WORK WAS NOT HALF DONE ALADDIN
6359-64713-0035 WHO KNEW THAT ALL THE SULTAN'S ENDEAVOURS TO MAKE THIS WINDOW LIKE THE REST WERE IN VAIN SENT FOR THE JEWELLERS AND GOLDSMITHS AND NOT ONLY COMMANDED THEM TO DESIST FROM THEIR WORK BUT ORDERED THEM TO UNDO WHAT THEY HAD BEGUN
6359-64713-0036 AND TO CARRY ALL THEIR JEWELS BACK TO THE SULTAN AND TO THE VIZIER THEY UNDID IN A FEW HOURS WHAT THEY HAD BEEN SIX WEEKS ABOUT AND RETIRED LEAVING ALADDIN ALONE IN THE HALL HE TOOK THE LAMP WHICH HE CARRIED ABOUT HIM RUBBED IT
6359-64713-0037 AND PRESENTLY THE GENIE APPEARED GENIE SAID ALADDIN I ORDERED THEE TO LEAVE ONE OF THE FOUR AND TWENTY WINDOWS OF THIS HALL IMPERFECT AND THOU HAST EXECUTED MY COMMANDS PUNCTUALLY NOW
6359-64713-0038 I WOULD HAVE THEE MAKE IT LIKE THE REST THE GENIE IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARED ALADDIN WENT OUT OF THE HALL AND RETURNING SOON AFTER FOUND THE WINDOW AS HE WISHED IT TO BE LIKE THE OTHERS IN THE MEAN TIME
6359-64713-0039 THE JEWELLERS AND GOLDSMITHS REPAIRED TO THE PALACE AND WERE INTRODUCED INTO THE SULTAN'S PRESENCE WHERE THE CHIEF JEWELLER PRESENTED THE PRECIOUS STONES WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT BACK THE SULTAN ASKED THEM IF ALADDIN HAD GIVEN THEM ANY REASON FOR SO DOING
6359-64713-0040 ALADDIN HAD CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN THIS MANNER SEVERAL YEARS WHEN THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN WHO HAD FOR SOME YEARS DISMISSED HIM FROM HIS RECOLLECTION DETERMINED TO INFORM HIMSELF WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER HE PERISHED AS HE SUPPOSED
6359-64713-0041 IN THE SUBTERRANEAN CAVE OR NOT AFTER HE HAD RESORTED TO A LONG COURSE OF MAGIC CEREMONIES AND HAD FORMED A HOROSCOPE BY WHICH TO ASCERTAIN ALADDIN'S FATE WHAT WAS HIS SURPRISE TO FIND THE APPEARANCES TO DECLARE THAT ALADDIN
6359-64713-0042 INSTEAD OF DYING IN THE CAVE HAD MADE HIS ESCAPE AND WAS LIVING IN ROYAL SPLENDOUR BY THE AID OF THE GENIE OF THE WONDERFUL LAMP ON THE VERY NEXT DAY
6359-64713-0043 WHERE ON HIS ARRIVAL HE TOOK UP HIS LODGINGS IN A KHAN HE THEN QUICKLY LEARNT ABOUT THE WEALTH CHARITIES HAPPINESS AND SPLENDID PALACE OF PRINCE ALADDIN DIRECTLY HE SAW THE WONDERFUL FABRIC HE KNEW THAT NONE BUT THE GENIES
6359-64713-0044 HE RETURNED TO THE KHAN ON HIS RETURN HE HAD RECOURSE TO AN OPERATION OF GEOMANCY TO FIND OUT WHERE THE LAMP WAS WHETHER ALADDIN CARRIED IT ABOUT WITH HIM OR WHERE HE LEFT IT
6359-64713-0045 THE RESULT OF HIS CONSULTATION INFORMED HIM TO HIS GREAT JOY THAT THE LAMP WAS IN THE PALACE WELL SAID HE RUBBING HIS HANDS IN GLEE
6359-64713-0046 I SHALL HAVE THE LAMP AND I SHALL MAKE ALADDIN RETURN TO HIS ORIGINAL MEAN CONDITION THE NEXT DAY THE MAGICIAN LEARNT FROM THE CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT OF THE KHAN WHERE HE LODGED THAT ALADDIN HAD GONE ON A HUNTING EXPEDITION
6359-64713-0047 HE RESOLVED AT ONCE ON HIS PLANS HE WENT TO A COPPERSMITH AND ASKED FOR A DOZEN COPPER LAMPS THE MASTER OF THE SHOP TOLD HIM HE HAD NOT SO MANY BY HIM BUT IF HE WOULD HAVE PATIENCE TILL THE NEXT DAY HE WOULD HAVE THEM READY THE MAGICIAN
6359-64713-0048 APPOINTED HIS TIME AND DESIRED HIM TO TAKE CARE THAT THEY SHOULD BE HANDSOME AND WELL POLISHED THE NEXT DAY THE MAGICIAN CALLED FOR THE TWELVE LAMPS PAID THE MAN HIS FULL PRICE PUT THEM INTO A BASKET HANGING ON HIS ARM AND WENT DIRECTLY TO ALADDIN'S PALACE
6359-64713-0049 AS HE APPROACHED HE BEGAN CRYING
6359-64713-0050 A CROWD OF CHILDREN COLLECTED WHO HOOTED AND THOUGHT HIM AS DID ALL WHO CHANCED TO BE PASSING BY A MADMAN OR A FOOL TO OFFER TO CHANGE NEW LAMPS FOR OLD ONES
6359-64713-0051 THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN REGARDED NOT THEIR SCOFFS HOOTINGS OR ALL THEY COULD SAY TO HIM BUT STILL CONTINUED CRYING
6359-64713-0052 HE REPEATED THIS SO OFTEN WALKING BACKWARD AND FORWARD IN FRONT OF THE PALACE THAT THE PRINCESS WHO WAS THEN IN THE HALL WITH THE FOUR AND TWENTY WINDOWS HEARING A MAN CRY SOMETHING AND SEEING A GREAT MOB CROWDING ABOUT HIM SENT ONE OF HER WOMEN SLAVES TO KNOW WHAT HE CRIED
6359-64713-0053 THE SLAVE RETURNED LAUGHING SO HEARTILY THAT THE PRINCESS REBUKED HER MADAM ANSWERED THE SLAVE LAUGHING STILL WHO CAN FORBEAR LAUGHING
6359-64713-0054 TO SEE AN OLD MAN WITH A BASKET ON HIS ARM FULL OF FINE NEW LAMPS ASKING TO CHANGE THEM FOR OLD ONES THE CHILDREN AND MOB CROWDING ABOUT HIM SO THAT HE CAN HARDLY STIR MAKE ALL THE NOISE THEY CAN IN DERISION OF HIM
6359-64713-0055 ANOTHER FEMALE SLAVE HEARING THIS SAID NOW YOU SPEAK OF LAMPS I KNOW NOT WHETHER THE PRINCESS MAY HAVE OBSERVED IT BUT THERE IS AN OLD ONE UPON A SHELF OF THE PRINCE ALADDIN'S ROBING ROOM AND WHOEVER OWNS IT
6359-64713-0056 WILL NOT BE SORRY TO FIND A NEW ONE IN ITS STEAD IF THE PRINCESS CHOOSES SHE MAY HAVE THE PLEASURE OF TRYING IF THIS OLD MAN IS SO SILLY AS TO GIVE A NEW LAMP FOR AN OLD ONE WITHOUT TAKING ANYTHING FOR THE EXCHANGE
6359-64713-0057 THE PRINCESS WHO KNEW NOT THE VALUE OF THIS LAMP AND THE INTEREST THAT ALADDIN HAD TO KEEP IT SAFE ENTERED INTO THE PLEASANTRY AND COMMANDED A SLAVE TO TAKE IT AND MAKE THE EXCHANGE THE SLAVE OBEYED WENT OUT OF THE HALL AND NO SOONER GOT TO THE PALACE GATES
6359-64713-0058 THAN HE SAW THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN CALLED TO HIM AND SHOWING HIM THE OLD LAMP SAID GIVE ME A NEW LAMP FOR THIS THE MAGICIAN NEVER DOUBTED BUT THIS WAS THE LAMP HE WANTED THERE COULD BE NO OTHER SUCH IN THIS PALACE WHERE EVERY UTENSIL WAS GOLD OR SILVER
6359-64713-0059 AND THRUSTING IT AS FAR AS HE COULD INTO HIS BREAST OFFERED HIM HIS BASKET AND BADE HIM CHOOSE WHICH HE LIKED BEST THE SLAVE PICKED OUT ONE AND CARRIED IT TO THE PRINCESS BUT THE CHANGE WAS NO SOONER MADE THAN THE PLACE RUNG WITH THE SHOUTS OF THE CHILDREN
6359-64713-0060 DERIDING THE MAGICIAN'S FOLLY THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN STAYED NO LONGER NEAR THE PALACE NOR CRIED ANY MORE NEW LAMPS FOR OLD ONES BUT MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY TO HIS KHAN HIS END WAS ANSWERED
6359-64713-0061 AND BY HIS SILENCE HE GOT RID OF THE CHILDREN AND THE MOB AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT OF THE TWO PALACES
6359-64713-0062 SET ALL DOWN IN A SPOT WHERE NOBODY SAW HIM THEN GOING DOWN ANOTHER STREET OR TWO HE WALKED TILL HE CAME TO ONE OF THE CITY GATES
6359-64713-0063 WHICH WERE VERY EXTENSIVE AT LENGTH REACHED A LONELY SPOT WHERE HE STOPPED TILL THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT AS THE MOST SUITABLE TIME FOR THE DESIGN HE HAD IN CONTEMPLATION WHEN IT BECAME QUITE DARK HE PULLED THE LAMP OUT OF HIS BREAST AND RUBBED IT AT THAT SUMMONS
6359-64713-0064 THE GENIE APPEARED AND SAID
6359-64713-0065 AND THE SLAVE OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE THAT LAMP IN THEIR HANDS BOTH I AND THE OTHER SLAVES OF THE LAMP I COMMAND THEE REPLIED THE MAGICIAN
6359-64713-0066 TO TRANSPORT ME IMMEDIATELY AND THE PALACE
6359-64713-0067 TO AFRICA THE GENIE MADE NO REPLY BUT WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE OTHER GENIES THE SLAVES OF THE LAMP IMMEDIATELY TRANSPORTED HIM AND THE PALACE ENTIRE TO THE SPOT WHITHER HE HAD BEEN DESIRED TO CONVEY IT EARLY THE NEXT MORNING
6359-64713-0068 WHEN THE SULTAN ACCORDING TO CUSTOM WENT TO CONTEMPLATE AND ADMIRE ALADDIN'S PLACE HIS AMAZEMENT WAS UNBOUNDED TO FIND THAT IT COULD NOWHERE BE SEEN HE COULD NOT COMPREHEND HOW SO LARGE A PALACE WHICH HE HAD SEEN PLAINLY EVERY DAY FOR SOME YEARS
6359-64713-0069 SHOULD VANISH SO SOON AND NOT LEAVE THE LEAST REMAINS BEHIND IN HIS PERPLEXITY HE ORDERED THE GRAND VIZIER TO BE SENT FOR WITH EXPEDITION THE GRAND VIZIER WHO IN SECRET BORE NO GOOD WILL TO ALADDIN
6359-64713-0070 INTIMATED HIS SUSPICION THAT THE PALACE WAS BUILT BY MAGIC AND THAT ALADDIN HAD MADE HIS HUNTING EXCURSION AN EXCUSE FOR THE REMOVAL OF HIS PALACE WITH THE SAME SUDDENNESS WITH WHICH IT HAD BEEN ERECTED
6359-64713-0071 HE INDUCED THE SULTAN TO SEND A DETACHMENT OF HIS GUARD AND TO HAVE ALADDIN SEIZED AS A PRISONER OF STATE ON HIS SON IN LAW BEING BROUGHT BEFORE HIM HE WOULD NOT HEAR A WORD FROM HIM BUT ORDERED HIM TO BE PUT TO DEATH
6359-64713-0072 THE DECREE CAUSED SO MUCH DISCONTENT AMONG THE PEOPLE WHOSE AFFECTION ALADDIN HAD SECURED BY HIS LARGESSES AND CHARITIES THAT THE SULTAN FEARFUL OF AN INSURRECTION WAS OBLIGED TO GRANT HIM HIS LIFE
6359-64713-0073 WHEN ALADDIN FOUND HIMSELF AT LIBERTY HE AGAIN ADDRESSED THE SULTAN SIRE I PRAY YOU TO LET ME KNOW THE CRIME BY WHICH I HAVE THUS LOST THE FAVOUR OF THY COUNTENANCE YOUR CRIME ANSWERED THE SULTAN
6359-64713-0074 WRETCHED MAN DO YOU NOT KNOW IT FOLLOW ME AND I WILL SHOW YOU THE SULTAN THEN TOOK ALADDIN INTO THE APARTMENT FROM WHENCE HE WAS WONT TO LOOK AT AND ADMIRE HIS PALACE AND SAID
6359-64713-0075 YOU OUGHT TO KNOW WHERE YOUR PALACE STOOD LOOK MIND AND TELL ME WHAT HAS BECOME OF IT ALADDIN DID SO
6359-64713-0076 AT LAST RECOVERING HIMSELF HE SAID IT IS TRUE I DO NOT SEE THE PALACE IT IS VANISHED BUT I HAD NO CONCERN IN ITS REMOVAL I BEG YOU TO GIVE ME FORTY DAYS AND IF IN THAT TIME I CANNOT RESTORE IT
6359-64713-0077 I WILL OFFER MY HEAD TO BE DISPOSED OF AT YOUR PLEASURE I GIVE YOU THE TIME YOU ASK BUT AT THE END OF THE FORTY DAYS FORGET NOT TO PRESENT YOURSELF BEFORE ME ALADDIN WENT OUT OF THE SULTAN'S PALACE IN A CONDITION OF EXCEEDING HUMILIATION
6359-64713-0078 THE LORDS WHO HAD COURTED HIM IN THE DAYS OF HIS SPLENDOUR NOW DECLINED TO HAVE ANY COMMUNICATION WITH HIM FOR THREE DAYS HE WANDERED ABOUT THE CITY EXCITING THE WONDER AND COMPASSION OF THE MULTITUDE
6359-64713-0079 IF THEY HAD SEEN HIS PALACE OR COULD TELL HIM ANYTHING OF IT ON THE THIRD DAY HE WANDERED INTO THE COUNTRY AND AS HE WAS APPROACHING A RIVER HE FELL DOWN THE BANK WITH SO MUCH VIOLENCE THAT HE RUBBED THE RING WHICH THE MAGICIAN HAD GIVEN HIM SO HARD
6359-64713-0080 BY HOLDING ON THE ROCK TO SAVE HIMSELF THAT IMMEDIATELY
6359-64713-0081 SAID THE GENIE I AM READY TO OBEY THEE AS THY SLAVE AND THE SLAVE OF ALL THOSE THAT HAVE THAT RING ON THEIR FINGER BOTH I
6359-64713-0082 AND THE OTHER SLAVES OF THE RING ALADDIN AGREEABLY SURPRISED AT AN OFFER OF HELP SO LITTLE EXPECTED REPLIED GENIE SHOW ME WHERE THE PALACE I CAUSED TO BE BUILT NOW STANDS
