8066-290047-0000 LITTLE MOTHER SHE WAS A CLEAR EYED FRESH CHEEKED LITTLE MAIDEN LIVING ON THE BANKS OF THE GREAT MISSISSIPPI THE OLDEST OF FOUR CHILDREN AND MOTHER'S LITTLE WOMAN ALWAYS
8066-290047-0001 THEY CALLED HER SO BECAUSE OF HER QUIET MATRONLY CARE OF THE YOUNGER MAYFIELDS THAT WAS THE FATHER'S NAME HER OWN NAME WAS THE BEAUTIFUL ONE OF ELIZABETH BUT THEY SHORTENED IT TO BESS
8066-290047-0002 TWO DAYS WENT BY WHEN DADDY JIM AND MAMMY BEGGED TO BE ALLOWED TO GO TO THE QUARTERS WHERE THE NEGROES LIVED TO SEE THEIR DAUGHTER JENNIE WHO WAS POW'FUL BAD WID THE TOOTHACHE THEY DECLARED THEY WOULD BE BACK BY EVENING SO BESS WAS WILLING
8066-290047-0003 SHE PUT THE LITTLE GIRLS TO BED AND PERSUADED ROB TO GO THEN SEATED HERSELF BY THE TABLE WITH HER MOTHER'S WORK BASKET IN QUAINT IMITATION OF MISSUS MAYFIELD'S INDUSTRY IN THE EVENING TIME BUT WHAT WAS THIS
8066-290047-0004 WHAT SHOULD SHE DO MAMMY'S STORIES OF HOW HOMES HAD BEEN WASHED AWAY AND BROKEN IN PIECES WERE IN HER MIND OH IF I HAD A BOAT SHE EXCLAIMED BUT THERE ISN'T ANYTHING OF THE SORT ON THE PLACE
8066-290047-0005 THE WATER WAS NOW SEVERAL INCHES DEEP ON THE PORCH AND SHE CONTRIVED TO HALF FLOAT
8066-290047-0006 WITHOUT FRIGHTENING THE CHILDREN SHE GOT THEM DRESSED IN THE WARMEST CLOTHES THEY HAD SHE LINED THE OBLONG TUB WITH A BLANKET AND MADE READY BREAD AND COLD MEAT LEFT FROM SUPPER WITH ROB'S ASSISTANCE SHE DRAGGED THE TUB UPSTAIRS
8066-290047-0007 THERE WAS A SINGLE LARGE WINDOW IN THE ROOM AND THEY SET THE TUB DIRECTLY BY IT SO THAT WHEN THE WATER ROSE THE TUB WOULD FLOAT OUT THERE WAS NO WAY FOR THE CHILDREN TO REACH THE ROOF WHICH WAS A VERY STEEP INCLINED ONE
8066-290047-0008 IT DID NOT SEEM LONG BEFORE THE WATER HAD VERY NEARLY RISEN TO THE TOP OF THE STAIRS LEADING FROM BELOW BESS FLUNG THE WINDOW OPEN AND MADE ROB GET INTO THEIR NOVEL BOAT THEN SHE LIFTED IN KATE
8066-290047-0009 DREW A LONG BREATH AND KISSED THE CHILDREN QUIETLY
8066-290047-0010 AND THAT THEY MUST SIT STILL GOODBYE DEARS SAY A PRAYER FOR SISTER ROB IF YOU EVER SEE FATHER AND MOTHER TELL THEM I TOOK CARE OF YOU THEN THE WATER SEIZED THE INSECURE VESSEL
8066-290047-0011 DISCOVERED THE TUB LODGED IN THE BRANCHES OF A SYCAMORE WITH THE CHILDREN WEEPING AND CHILLED BUT SAFE AND BESS AH WHERE WAS BESS THE LITTLE MOTHER WHO IN THAT BRIEF MOMENT RESIGNED HERSELF TO DEATH
8066-290047-0012 HE CAME IN SO VERY QUIETLY CLOSED THE DOOR GENTLY AND I THINK I EVEN HEARD HIM GO TO THE CLOSET TO HANG UP HIS BOOKS OH DEAR I HOPE HE ISN'T GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER ATTACK OF GRIPPE AND MISSUS ELLIS SHIVERED
8066-290047-0013 AS SHE GLANCED OUT AT THE SNOW COVERED LANDSCAPE AS HER EYES TURNED ONCE MORE TO THE WARM LUXURIOUS ROOM IN WHICH SHE WAS SEATED THE PORTIERES WERE PUSHED ASIDE AND A LITTLE BOY OF TEN YEARS OF AGE ENTERED LITTLE WALTER WAS ALL THAT REMAINED OF FOUR BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN
8066-290047-0014 WHO ONLY A YEAR AGO ROMPED GAILY THROUGH THE LARGE HALLS THAT DREAD DISEASE DIPHTHERIA HAD STOLEN THE OLDER BROTHER AND LAUGHING LITTLE SISTERS IN ONE SHORT WEEK'S TIME SO THAT NOW AS THE SAD ANNIVERSARY CAME NEAR TO HAND
8066-290047-0015 TODAY HIS USUALLY MERRY FACE WAS VERY GRAVE AND HE LOOKED VERY THOUGHTFUL AS HE GAVE HIS MOTHER HER KISS AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE DRAWN UPON HER LAP WHAT AILS MOTHER'S PET IS HE SICK
8066-290047-0016 SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY NO MOTHER DEAR I'M NOT SICK BUT I FEEL SO SAD AT HEART YOU SEE HE CONTINUED IN ANSWER TO HER QUESTIONING LOOK ROBBIE GOODMAN AND I ALWAYS WALK TOGETHER GOING AND COMING FROM SCHOOL
8066-290047-0017 AND I HAVE NOTICED THAT HE HAS NEVER WORN ANY OVERCOAT THIS WINTER BUT YOU KNOW ITS BEEN UNUSUALLY WARM AND I THOUGHT PERHAPS HIS MOTHER DID NOT MAKE HIM WRAP UP LIKE YOU DID ME
8066-290047-0018 AFTER AWHILE HE SAID MY I AM SO COLD AND I SAID
8066-290047-0019 ONLY THEN HE WOULD NOT HAVE ANY AND OF COURSE HE MUST HAVE ONE TO WEAR WHEN HE GOES TO THE CHAPEL AND TO SEE SICK PEOPLE EVEN THAT ONE IS THIN AND PATCHED
8066-290047-0020 BUT THEY DID NOT COME AT CHRISTMAS LIKE THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD
8066-290047-0021 TONIGHT MOTHER CONTINUED WALTER HE HAD AN AWFUL COLD AND COUGHED JUST LIKE OUR HARRY DID LAST YEAR AND THE LONG PENT UP TEARS FLOWED FROM THE CHILD'S EYES AS MOTHER AND SON DRIED THEIR TEARS THE CHILD LOOKED UP WITH PERFECT CONFIDENCE AS HE SAID
8066-290047-0022 SAID MISSUS ELLIS AND SENT THE CHILD OFF TO THE PLAY ROOM BY THE WAY MY DEAR REMARKED MISSUS ELLIS AS THEY SAT CHATTING AT THE TEA TABLE AFTER WALTER HAD RETIRED WHAT HAS BECOME OF THAT PREACHER GOODMAN
8066-290047-0023 WHO PREACHED FOR US ONCE ON TRIAL OH HE HAS A MISSION DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CITY BUT HE LIVES ON THIS SIDE AS MOORE GIVES HIM THE HOUSE RENT FREE I MET HIM THE OTHER DAY HE LOOKED VERY NEEDY
8066-290047-0024 THE MAN HAD WONDERFUL TALENTS AND MIGHT HAVE A RICH CONGREGATION AND IMPROVE HIMSELF BUT HE IS PERSISTENT IN HIS IDEAS CONCERNING THIS HOLINESS MOVEMENT AND OF COURSE A LARGE CHURCH LIKE OURS WANTS SOMETHING TO ATTRACT AND INTEREST INSTEAD OF SUCH EGOTISTICAL DISCOURSES
8066-290047-0025 I FOR ONE GO TO SLEEP UNDER THEM AND MISTER ELLIS DREW HIMSELF UP WITH A POMPOUS AIR AS HE WENT INTO THE LIBRARY WHITHER HIS WIFE PRESENTLY FOLLOWED HE HAD PICKED UP A NEWSPAPER AND WAS APPARENTLY ABSORBED
8066-290047-0026 HE WANTS ME TO GIVE UP BUYING HIM THE FUR TRIMMED OVERCOAT AND GET A COAT AND SHOES FOR GOODMAN'S CHILDREN AS THEY WERE PRAYING SO HARD FOR THEM BUT I HAVE ENOUGH TO DO WITHOUT CLOTHING OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN
8066-290047-0027 WHEN YOU YOURSELF ARE CONVINCED THAT HIS DOCTRINES ARE SOUND BESIDES HE MUST BE DOING A GOOD WORK DOWN AMONG THE POOR CLASSES OF THE CITY AS IT APPEARS THE RICH DON'T WANT HIM THEN LET THE POOR GIVE ENOUGH TO KEEP HIM
8066-290047-0028 THEY DO GIVE FAR BEYOND THEIR MEANS BUT THE LORD CALLS ON SUCH AS US TO GIVE I KNOW IT HAS BEEN AN UNUSUALLY HARD YEAR BUT THE LORD HAS BLESSED US AND HE WILL HOLD US TO AN ACCOUNT I FEEL VERY SAD AS THE ANNIVERSARY OF OUR DARLINGS DEPARTURE DRAWS NEAR
8066-290047-0029 LONG AND LATE PAUL ELLIS SAT THERE AND MANY THINGS GHOSTS OF THE PAST ROSE BEFORE HIM AS THE MIDNIGHT CHIMES RANG OUT HE KNELT AND PRAYED OH LORD FORGIVE ME
8066-290047-0030 ROBERT GOODMAN RECEIVED A LARGE PACKAGE FROM AN UNKNOWN FRIEND CONTAINING A WARM OVERCOAT AND THREE PAIRS OF SHOES HIS FATHER ALSO RECEIVED A PRESENT IT CAME THROUGH THE MAIL AND WAS AN HONEST CONFESSION OF A WRONG DONE HIM ALSO A CHECK FOR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS
8066-290047-0031 ONE YEAR LATER THIS CHURCH GAVE A UNANIMOUS CALL TO BROTHER GOODMAN AND THE REVIVAL WHICH BROKE OUT THAT WINTER WAS UNPRECEDENTED IN THE ANNALS OF THAT CHURCH VERILY A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM LUELLA WATSON KINDER
