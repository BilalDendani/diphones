3467-166572-0000 CHAOS IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND MISTER CHALLONER'S FEELINGS OR EVEN THOSE OF DORIS AT THE MOMENT OF MISTER BROTHERSON'S DEPARTURE BUT WHY THIS CHANGE IN BROTHERSON HIMSELF
3467-166572-0001 WHY THIS SENSE OF SOMETHING NEW AND TERRIBLE RISING BETWEEN HIM AND THE SUDDENLY BECLOUDED FUTURE LET US FOLLOW HIM TO HIS LONELY HOTEL ROOM AND SEE IF WE CAN SOLVE THE PUZZLE BUT FIRST
3467-166572-0002 DOES HE UNDERSTAND HIS OWN TROUBLE HE DOES NOT SEEM TO FOR WHEN HIS HAT THROWN ASIDE HE STOPS ERECT AND FROWNING UNDER THE FLARING GAS JET HE HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF LIGHTING
3467-166572-0003 HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO LIFT HIS HAND TO HIS HEAD IN A GESTURE OF SURPRISING HELPLESSNESS FOR HIM WHILE SNATCHES OF BROKEN SENTENCES FELL FROM HIS LIPS AMONG WHICH COULD BE HEARD WHAT HAS COME TO ME
3467-166572-0004 UNDONE IN AN HOUR DOUBLY UNDONE FIRST BY A FACE AND THEN BY THIS THOUGHT WHICH SURELY THE DEVILS HAVE WHISPERED TO ME MISTER CHALLONER AND OSWALD WHAT IS THE LINK BETWEEN THEM GREAT
3467-166572-0005 FLINGING HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR HE BURIED HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS THERE WERE TWO DEMONS TO FIGHT THE FIRST IN THE GUISE OF AN ANGEL DORIS
3467-166572-0006 UNKNOWN YESTERDAY UNKNOWN AN HOUR AGO BUT NOW HAD THERE EVER BEEN A DAY AN HOUR WHEN SHE HAD NOT BEEN AS THE VERY THROB OF HIS HEART THE LIGHT OF HIS EYES
3467-166572-0007 AND THE CROWN OF ALL IMAGINABLE BLISSES HE WAS STARTLED AT HIS OWN EMOTION AS HE CONTEMPLATED HER IMAGE IN HIS FANCY AND LISTENED FOR THE LOST ECHO OF THE FEW WORDS SHE HAD SPOKEN
3467-166572-0008 WORDS SO FULL OF MUSIC WHEN THEY REFERRED TO HIS BROTHER SO HARD AND COLD WHEN SHE SIMPLY ADDRESSED HIMSELF THIS WAS NO PASSING ADMIRATION OF YOUTH FOR A CAPTIVATING WOMAN
3467-166572-0009 THIS WAS NOT EVEN THE LOVE HE HAD GIVEN TO EDITH CHALLONER THIS WAS SOMETHING SPRINGING FULL BORN OUT OF NOTHING A FORCE WHICH FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE MADE HIM COMPLAISANT TO THE NATURAL WEAKNESSES OF MAN
3467-166572-0010 A DREAM AND YET A REALITY STRONG ENOUGH TO BLOT OUT THE PAST REMAKE THE PRESENT CHANGE THE ASPECT OF ALL HIS HOPES AND OUTLINE A NEW FATE HE DID NOT KNOW HIMSELF
3467-166572-0011 THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS WHOLE HISTORY TO GIVE HIM AN UNDERSTANDING OF SUCH FEELINGS AS THESE CAN A MAN BE SEIZED AS IT WERE BY THE HAIR AND SWUNG UP ON THE SLOPES OF PARADISE OR DOWN THE STEEPS OF HELL WITHOUT A FOREWARNING
3467-166572-0012 WITHOUT THE CHANCE EVEN TO SAY WHETHER HE WISHED SUCH A CATACLYSM IN HIS LIFE OR NO
3467-166572-0013 SCIENCE HAD BEEN HIS MISTRESS AMBITION HIS LODE STAR SUCH FEELING AS HE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED TO HAD BEEN FOR MEN STRUGGLING MEN MEN WHO WERE DOWN TRODDEN AND GASPING IN THE NARROW BOUNDS OF POVERTY AND HELPLESSNESS
3467-166572-0014 MISS CHALLONER HAD ROUSED WELL HIS PRIDE HE COULD SEE THAT NOW THE MIGHT OF THIS NEW EMOTION MADE PLAIN MANY THINGS HE HAD PASSED BY AS USELESS PUERILE
3467-166572-0015 UNWORTHY OF A MAN OF MENTAL CALIBRE AND MIGHT HE HAD NEVER LOVED EDITH CHALLONER AT ANY MOMENT OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCESHIP THOUGH HE HAD BEEN SINCERE IN THINKING THAT HE DID
3467-166572-0016 OSWALD THE CLEVEREST MAN DORIS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA HE HAD ACCEPTED THE GOSSIP THEN HE HAD NOT SEEN HER AND IT ALL SEEMED VERY NATURAL HARDLY WORTH A MOMENT'S THOUGHT
3467-166572-0017 BUT NOW AND HERE THE OTHER DEMON SPRANG ERECT AND GRAPPLED WITH HIM BEFORE THE FIRST ONE HAD LET GO HIS HOLD OSWALD AND CHALLONER THE SECRET
3467-166572-0018 UNKNOWN SOMETHING WHICH HAD SOFTENED THAT HARD MAN'S EYE WHEN HIS BROTHER'S NAME WAS MENTIONED HE HAD NOTED IT AND REALISED THE MYSTERY A MYSTERY BEFORE WHICH SLEEP AND REST MUST FLY A MYSTERY TO WHICH HE MUST NOW GIVE HIS THOUGHT
3467-166572-0019 WHATEVER THE COST WHATEVER THE LOSS TO THOSE HEAVENLY DREAMS THE MAGIC OF WHICH WAS SO NEW IT SEEMED TO ENVELOPE HIM IN THE BALM OF PARADISE AWAY THEN IMAGE OF LIGHT LET THE FACULTIES THOU HAST DAZED ACT AGAIN
3467-166572-0020 THERE IS MORE THAN FATE'S CAPRICE IN CHALLONER'S INTEREST IN A MAN HE NEVER SAW GHOSTS OF OLD MEMORIES RISE AND DEMAND A HEARING FACTS TRIVIAL AND COMMONPLACE ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN LOST IN OBLIVION WITH THE DAY WHICH GAVE THEM BIRTH
3467-166572-0021 THRONG AGAIN FROM THE PAST PROVING THAT NOUGHT DIES WITHOUT A POSSIBILITY OF RESURRECTION THEIR POWER OVER THIS BROODING MAN IS SHOWN BY THE FORCE WITH WHICH HIS FINGERS CRUSH AGAINST HIS BOWED FOREHEAD OSWALD AND CHALLONER
3467-166572-0022 HAD HE FOUND THE CONNECTING LINK HAD IT BEEN COULD IT HAVE BEEN EDITH THE PREPOSTEROUS IS SOMETIMES TRUE COULD IT BE TRUE IN THIS CASE
3467-166572-0023 THE EFFUSIONS OF HER MIND THE BREATHINGS OF HER HEART DIRECTED TO AN ACTUAL O B AND THAT O B HIS BROTHER THEY HAD NOT BEEN MEANT FOR HIM HE HAD READ ENOUGH OF THE MAWKISH LINES TO BE SURE OF THAT
3467-166572-0024 NONE OF THE ALLUSIONS FITTED IN WITH THE FACTS OF THEIR MUTUAL INTERCOURSE BUT THEY MIGHT WITH THOSE OF ANOTHER MAN THEY MIGHT WITH THE POSSIBLE ACTS AND AFFECTIONS OF OSWALD WHOSE TEMPERAMENT WAS WHOLLY DIFFERENT FROM HIS AND WHO MIGHT HAVE LOVED HER
3467-166572-0025 SHOULD IT EVER BE SHOWN THAT THEY HAD MET AND KNOWN EACH OTHER AND THIS WAS NOT AN IMPOSSIBILITY OSWALD HAD BEEN EAST
3467-166572-0026 OSWALD WHY IT WAS OSWALD WHO HAD SUGGESTED THAT HE SHOULD GO THERE GO WHERE SHE STILL WAS WHY THIS SECOND COINCIDENCE IF THERE WERE NO TIE IF THE CHALLONERS AND OSWALD WERE AS FAR APART AS THEY SEEMED
3467-166572-0027 AND AS CONVENTIONALITIES WOULD NATURALLY PLACE THEM OSWALD WAS A SENTIMENTALIST BUT VERY RESERVED ABOUT HIS SENTIMENTALITIES IF THESE SUPPOSITIONS WERE TRUE HE HAD HAD A SENTIMENTALIST'S MOTIVE FOR WHAT HE DID
3467-166572-0028 AS ORLANDO REALISED THIS HE ROSE FROM HIS SEAT AGHAST AT THE POSSIBILITIES CONFRONTING HIM FROM THIS LINE OF THOUGHT SHOULD HE CONTEMPLATE THEM RISK HIS REASON BY DWELLING ON A SUPPOSITION WHICH MIGHT HAVE NO FOUNDATION IN FACT
3467-166572-0029 NO HIS BRAIN WAS TOO FULL HIS PURPOSES TOO IMPORTANT FOR ANY UNNECESSARY STRAIN TO BE PUT UPON HIS FACULTIES NO THINKING INVESTIGATION FIRST
3467-166572-0030 MISTER CHALLONER SHOULD BE ABLE TO SETTLE THIS QUESTION HE WOULD SEE HIM EVEN AT THIS LATE HOUR HE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO FIND HIM IN ONE OF THE ROOMS BELOW
3467-166572-0031 AND AROUND IT WAS GROUPED A NUMBER OF MEN WITH THEIR PAPERS AND PIPES MISTER BROTHERSON ENTERING NATURALLY LOOKED THAT WAY FOR THE MAN HE WAS IN SEARCH OF AND WAS DISAPPOINTED NOT TO FIND HIM THERE
3467-166572-0032 BUT ON CASTING HIS GLANCES ELSEWHERE HE WAS RELIEVED TO SEE HIM STANDING IN ONE OF THE WINDOWS OVERLOOKING THE STREET HIS BACK WAS TO THE ROOM AND HE SEEMED TO BE LOST IN A FIT OF ABSTRACTION AS ORLANDO CROSSED TO HIM
3467-166572-0033 HE HAD TIME TO OBSERVE HOW MUCH WHITER WAS THIS MAN'S HEAD THAN IN THE LAST INTERVIEW HE HAD HELD WITH HIM IN THE CORONER'S OFFICE IN NEW YORK BUT THIS EVIDENCE OF GRIEF IN ONE WITH WHOM HE HAD LITTLE IF ANYTHING IN COMMON
3467-166572-0034 NEITHER TOUCHED HIS FEELINGS NOR DETERRED HIS STEP THE AWAKENING OF HIS HEART TO NEW AND PROFOUND EMOTIONS HAD NOT SOFTENED HIM TOWARDS THE SUFFERINGS OF OTHERS
3467-166572-0035 IF THOSE OTHERS STOOD WITHOUT THE PALE HE HAD PREVIOUSLY RAISED AS THE LEGITIMATE BOUNDARY OF A JUST MAN'S SYMPATHIES HE WAS AS I HAVE SAID AN EXTRAORDINARY SPECIMEN OF MANLY VIGOUR IN BODY AND IN MIND
3467-166572-0036 AND HIS PRESENCE IN ANY COMPANY ALWAYS ATTRACTED ATTENTION AND ROUSED IF IT NEVER SATISFIED CURIOSITY CONVERSATION ACCORDINGLY CEASED AS HE STRODE UP TO MISTER CHALLONER'S SIDE
3467-166572-0037 YOU SEE ME AGAIN MISTER CHALLONER MAY I BEG OF YOU A FEW MINUTES FURTHER CONVERSATION I WILL NOT DETAIN YOU LONG THE GREY HEAD TURNED AND THE MANY EYES WATCHING SHOWED SURPRISE AT THE EXPRESSION OF DISLIKE AND REPULSION
3467-166572-0038 BUT HIS ANSWER WAS COURTEOUS ENOUGH IF MISTER BROTHERSON KNEW A PLACE WHERE THEY WOULD BE LEFT UNDISTURBED HE WOULD LISTEN TO HIM IF HE WOULD BE VERY BRIEF
3467-166572-0039 WAS MISTER CHALLONER'S IMMEDIATE INQUIRY THIS I MAKE NO APOLOGIES AND EXPECT IN ANSWER NOTHING MORE THAN AN UNEQUIVOCAL YES OR NO YOU TELL ME THAT YOU HAVE NEVER MET MY BROTHER CAN THAT BE SAID
3467-166572-0040 OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY OF YOUR DECEASED DAUGHTER IN FACT NO SHE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH OSWALD BROTHERSON SHE WAS WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE
3467-166572-0041 ENTIRELY SO CORRESPONDED WITH HIM NOT EXACTLY HOW NOT EXACTLY HE WROTE TO HER OCCASIONALLY SHE WROTE TO HIM FREQUENTLY
3467-166572-0042 WENT DOWN IN INDISTINGUISHABLE CHAOS MISTER CHALLONER REALISED A SENSE OF HAVOC THOUGH THE EYES BENT UPON HIS COUNTENANCE HAD NOT WAVERED
3467-166572-0043 I HAVE READ SOME OF THOSE LETTERS THE INVENTOR FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE POLICE TOOK GREAT PAINS TO PLACE THEM UNDER MY EYE SUPPOSING THEM TO HAVE BEEN MEANT FOR ME BECAUSE OF THE INITIALS WRITTEN ON THE WRAPPER
3467-166572-0044 BUT THEY WERE MEANT FOR OSWALD YOU BELIEVE THAT NOW I KNOW IT AND THAT IS WHY I FOUND YOU IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM IT IS PROVIDENCE HAS ROBBED ME OF MY DAUGHTER
3467-166572-0045 IF THIS BROTHER OF YOURS SHOULD PROVE TO BE THE MAN I AM LED TO EXPECT I SHALL ASK HIM TO TAKE THAT PLACE IN MY HEART AND LIFE WHICH WAS ONCE HERS A QUICK RECOIL A SMOTHERED EXCLAMATION ON THE PART OF THE MAN HE ADDRESSED
3467-166572-0046 A BARB HAD BEEN HIDDEN IN THIS SIMPLE STATEMENT WHICH HAD REACHED SOME DEEPLY HIDDEN BUT VULNERABLE SPOT IN BROTHERSON'S BREAST WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN PIERCED BEFORE HIS EYE WHICH ALONE SEEMED ALIVE
3467-166572-0047 STILL RESTED PIERCINGLY UPON THAT OF MISTER CHALLONER BUT ITS LIGHT WAS FAST FADING AND SPEEDILY BECAME LOST IN A DIMNESS IN WHICH THE OTHER SEEMED TO SEE EXTINGUISHED THE LAST UPFLARING EMBERS OF THOSE INNER FIRES WHICH FEED THE ASPIRING SOUL
3467-166572-0048 IT WAS A SIGHT NO MAN COULD SEE UNMOVED MISTER CHALLONER TURNED SHARPLY AWAY IN DREAD OF THE ABYSS WHICH THE NEXT WORD HE UTTERED MIGHT OPEN BETWEEN THEM BUT ORLANDO BROTHERSON POSSESSED RESOURCES OF STRENGTH
3467-166572-0049 OF WHICH POSSIBLY HE WAS NOT AWARE HIMSELF WHEN MISTER CHALLONER STILL MORE AFFECTED BY THE SILENCE THAN BY THE DREAD I HAVE MENTIONED TURNED TO CONFRONT HIM AGAIN IT WAS TO FIND HIS FEATURES COMPOSED AND HIS GLANCE CLEAR
3467-166572-0050 YOU WILL NOT FIND YOUR CONFIDENCE MISPLACED OSWALD IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD FELLOW OF FEW FAULTS I BELIEVE IT NO MAN CAN BE SO UNIVERSALLY BELOVED WITHOUT SOME VERY SUBSTANTIAL CLAIMS TO REGARD
3467-166572-0051 I AM GLAD TO SEE THAT YOUR OPINION THOUGH GIVEN SOMEWHAT COLDLY COINCIDES WITH THAT OF HIS FRIENDS I AM NOT GIVEN TO EXAGGERATION WAS THE EVEN REPLY
3467-166572-0052 THE FLUSH WHICH HAD COME INTO MISTER CHALLONER'S CHEEK UNDER THE EFFORT HE HAD MADE TO SUSTAIN WITH UNFLINCHING HEROISM THIS INTERVIEW WITH THE MAN HE LOOKED UPON AS HIS MORTAL ENEMY SLOWLY FADED OUT
3467-166572-0053 TILL HE LOOKED THE WRAITH OF HIMSELF EVEN TO THE UNSYMPATHETIC EYES OF ORLANDO BROTHERSON A DUTY LAY BEFORE HIM WHICH WOULD TAX TO ITS UTMOST EXTENT HIS ALREADY GREATLY WEAKENED SELF CONTROL
3467-166572-0054 NOTHING WHICH HAD YET PASSED SHOWED THAT THIS MAN REALISED THE FACT THAT OSWALD HAD BEEN KEPT IN IGNORANCE OF MISS CHALLONER'S DEATH IF THESE BROTHERS WERE TO MEET ON THE MORROW
3467-166572-0055 IT MUST BE WITH THE FULL UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS ESPECIAL TOPIC WAS TO BE COMPLETELY AVOIDED BUT IN WHAT WORDS COULD HE URGE SUCH A REQUEST UPON THIS MAN NONE SUGGESTED THEMSELVES
3467-166572-0056 YET HE HAD PROMISED MISS SCOTT THAT HE WOULD ENSURE HIS SILENCE IN THIS REGARD AND IT WAS WITH THIS DIFFICULTY AND NO OTHER HE HAD BEEN STRUGGLING WHEN MISTER BROTHERSON CAME UPON HIM IN THE OTHER ROOM
3467-166572-0057 SUGGESTED THE LATTER AS AN OPPRESSIVE SILENCE SWALLOWED UP THAT ICY SENTENCE I HAVE ALREADY RECORDED I HAVE RETURNED MISTER CHALLONER REGAINING HIS COURAGE UNDER THE EXIGENCIES OF THE MOMENT
3467-166572-0058 MISS SCOTT IS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE YOUR PROMISE THAT YOU WILL AVOID ALL DISAGREEABLE TOPICS WITH YOUR BROTHER TILL THE DOCTOR PRONOUNCES HIM STRONG ENOUGH TO MEET THE TROUBLE WHICH AWAITS HIM YOU MEAN
3467-166572-0059 HE IS NOT AS UNHAPPY AS WE HE KNOWS NOTHING OF THE AFFLICTION WHICH HAS BEFALLEN HIM HE WAS TAKEN ILL THE REST WAS ALMOST INAUDIBLE
3467-166572-0060 DO YOU THINK I SHOULD BE APT TO BROACH THIS SUBJECT WITH ANY ONE LET ALONE WITH HIM WHOSE CONNECTION WITH IT I SHALL NEED DAYS TO REALISE I'M NOT SO GIVEN TO GOSSIP BESIDES HE AND I HAVE OTHER TOPICS OF INTEREST
3467-166572-0061 WITHOUT A WORD HE WHEELED ABOUT TOWARDS THE DOOR WITHOUT A WORD BROTHERSON STOOD WATCHING HIM GO TILL HE SAW HIS HAND FALL ON THE KNOB WHEN HE QUIETLY PREVENTED HIS EXIT BY SAYING
3467-166572-0062 UNHAPPY TRUTHS CANNOT BE LONG CONCEALED HOW SOON DOES THE DOCTOR THINK MY BROTHER CAN BEAR THESE INEVITABLE REVELATIONS HE SAID THIS MORNING THAT IF HIS PATIENT WERE AS WELL TO MORROW AS HIS PRESENT CONDITION GIVES PROMISE OF
3467-166572-0063 HE MIGHT BE TOLD IN ANOTHER WEEK ORLANDO BOWED HIS APPRECIATION OF THIS FACT BUT ADDED QUICKLY WHO IS TO DO THE TELLING DORIS NOBODY ELSE COULD BE TRUSTED WITH SO DELICATE A TASK
3467-166572-0064 MISTER CHALLONER LOOKED UP SURPRISED AT THE FEELING WITH WHICH THIS REQUEST WAS CHARGED AS HIS BROTHER HIS ONLY REMAINING RELATIVE I HAVE THAT RIGHT DO YOU THINK THAT DOR
3467-166572-0065 THAT MISS SCOTT CAN BE TRUSTED NOT TO FORESTALL THAT MOMENT BY ANY PREVIOUS HINT OF WHAT AWAITS HIM IF SHE SO PROMISES BUT WILL YOU EXACT THIS FROM HER
3467-166572-0066 IT SURELY CANNOT BE NECESSARY FOR ME TO SAY THAT YOUR PRESENCE WILL ADD INFINITELY TO THE DIFFICULTY OF HER TASK YET IT IS A DUTY I CANNOT SHIRK I WILL CONSULT THE DOCTOR ABOUT IT
3467-166572-0067 I WILL MAKE HIM SEE THAT I BOTH UNDERSTAND AND SHALL INSIST UPON MY RIGHTS IN THIS MATTER BUT YOU MAY TELL MISS DORIS THAT I WILL SIT OUT OF SIGHT AND THAT I SHALL NOT OBTRUDE MYSELF
3467-166572-0068 UNLESS MY NAME IS BROUGHT UP IN AN UNDESIRABLE WAY THE HAND ON THE DOOR KNOB MADE A SUDDEN MOVEMENT MISTER BROTHERSON I CAN BEAR NO MORE TO NIGHT WITH YOUR PERMISSION
3467-166572-0069 I WILL LEAVE THIS QUESTION TO BE SETTLED BY OTHERS AND WITH A REPETITION OF HIS FORMER BOW THE BEREAVED FATHER WITHDREW ORLANDO WATCHED HIM TILL THE DOOR CLOSED THEN HE TOO DROPPED HIS MASK
3467-166572-0070 BUT IT WAS ON AGAIN WHEN IN A LITTLE WHILE HE PASSED THROUGH THE SITTING ROOM ON HIS WAY UPSTAIRS NO OTHER DAY IN HIS WHOLE LIFE HAD BEEN LIKE THIS TO THE HARDY INVENTOR
