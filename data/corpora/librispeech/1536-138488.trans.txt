1536-138488-0000 BUT ON THIS SUBJECT THE HIGH CHURCHMEN COULD COUNT ON THE SUPPORT OF A LARGE BODY OF LOW CHURCHMEN THOSE MEMBERS WHO WISHED WELL TO NOTTINGHAM'S PLAN SAW THAT THEY WERE OUTNUMBERED AND DESPAIRING OF A VICTORY BEGAN TO MEDITATE A RETREAT
1536-138488-0001 THE ANCIENT USAGE WAS THAT A CONVOCATION SHOULD BE SUMMONED TOGETHER WITH A PARLIAMENT AND IT MIGHT WELL BE ARGUED THAT IF EVER THE ADVICE OF A CONVOCATION COULD BE NEEDED
1536-138488-0002 TILL THE CLERGY HAD HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF DECLARING THEIR OPINION THROUGH THE ANCIENT AND LEGITIMATE ORGAN THIS PROPOSITION WAS RECEIVED WITH GENERAL ACCLAMATION THE TORIES WERE WELL PLEASED TO SEE SUCH HONOUR DONE TO THE PRIESTHOOD
1536-138488-0003 PROBABLY FOR EVER THOSE WHIGS WHO WERE FOR THE COMPREHENSION BILL WERE WELL PLEASED TO ESCAPE WITHOUT A DEFEAT MANY OF THEM INDEED WERE NOT WITHOUT HOPES THAT MILD AND LIBERAL COUNSELS MIGHT PREVAIL IN THE ECCLESIASTICAL SENATE
1536-138488-0004 AN ADDRESS REQUESTING WILLIAM TO SUMMON THE CONVOCATION WAS VOTED WITHOUT A DIVISION THE CONCURRENCE OF THE LORDS WAS ASKED THE LORDS CONCURRED THE ADDRESS WAS CARRIED UP TO THE THRONE BY BOTH HOUSES THE KING PROMISED THAT HE WOULD AT A CONVENIENT SEASON DO WHAT HIS PARLIAMENT DESIRED
1536-138488-0005 AND NOTTINGHAM'S BILL WAS NOT AGAIN MENTIONED MANY WRITERS IMPERFECTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE HISTORY OF THAT AGE HAVE INFERRED FROM THESE PROCEEDINGS THAT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WAS AN ASSEMBLY OF HIGH CHURCHMEN
1536-138488-0006 BUT NOTHING IS MORE CERTAIN THAN THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE MEMBERS WERE EITHER LOW CHURCHMEN OR NOT CHURCHMEN AT ALL A VERY FEW DAYS BEFORE THIS TIME AN OCCURRENCE HAD TAKEN PLACE UNIMPORTANT IN ITSELF BUT HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT AS AN INDICATION OF THE TEMPER OF THE MAJORITY
1536-138488-0007 IT HAD BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THE HOUSE OUGHT IN CONFORMITY WITH ANCIENT USAGE TO ADJOURN OVER THE EASTER HOLIDAYS THE PURITANS AND LATITUDINARIANS OBJECTED THERE WAS A SHARP DEBATE THE HIGH CHURCHMEN DID NOT VENTURE TO DIVIDE AND TO THE GREAT SCANDAL OF MANY GRAVE PERSONS
1536-138488-0008 THE BILL FOR SETTLING THE OATHS HAD JUST COME DOWN FROM THE LORDS FRAMED IN A MANNER FAVOURABLE TO THE CLERGY ALL LAY FUNCTIONARIES WERE REQUIRED TO SWEAR FEALTY TO THE KING AND QUEEN ON PAIN OF EXPULSION FROM OFFICE
1536-138488-0009 UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD SEE REASON TO CALL ON HIM SPECIALLY FOR AN ASSURANCE OF HIS LOYALTY BURNETT HAD PARTLY NO DOUBT FROM THE GOODNATURE AND GENEROSITY WHICH BELONGED TO HIS CHARACTER AND PARTLY FROM A DESIRE TO CONCILIATE HIS BRETHREN
1536-138488-0010 BUT IN THE LOWER HOUSE THE FEELING AGAINST THE JACOBITE PRIESTS WAS IRRESISTIBLY STRONG ON THE VERY DAY ON WHICH THAT HOUSE VOTED WITHOUT A DIVISION THE ADDRESS REQUESTING THE KING TO SUMMON THE CONVOCATION A CLAUSE WAS PROPOSED AND CARRIED
1536-138488-0011 WHICH REQUIRED EVERY PERSON WHO HELD ANY ECCLESIASTICAL OR ACADEMICAL PREFERMENT TO TAKE THE OATHS BY THE FIRST OF AUGUST SIXTEEN EIGHTY NINE ON PAIN OF SUSPENSION SIX MONTHS TO BE RECKONED FROM THAT DAY WERE ALLOWED TO THE NONJUROR FOR RECONSIDERATION
1536-138488-0012 COMPROMISE AFTER COMPROMISE WAS SUGGESTED FROM THE IMPERFECT REPORTS WHICH HAVE COME DOWN TO US IT APPEARS THAT EVERY ARGUMENT IN FAVOUR OF LENITY WAS FORCIBLY URGED BY BURNET BUT THE COMMONS WERE FIRM TIME PRESSED
1536-138488-0013 BUT ABOUT THE TERMS OF THE OATH WHICH RELATED TO THE SPIRITUAL INSTITUTIONS OF THE REALM THERE WAS MUCH DEBATE SHOULD THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE PROMISE SIMPLY TO MAINTAIN THE PROTESTANT RELIGION ESTABLISHED BY LAW OR SHOULD HE PROMISE TO MAINTAIN THAT RELIGION AS IT SHOULD BE HEREAFTER ESTABLISHED BY LAW
1536-138488-0014 THE MAJORITY PREFERRED THE FORMER PHRASE THE LATTER PHRASE WAS PREFERRED BY THOSE WHIGS WHO WERE FOR A COMPREHENSION BUT IT WAS UNIVERSALLY ADMITTED THAT THE TWO PHRASES REALLY MEANT THE SAME THING AND THAT THE OATH HOWEVER IT MIGHT BE WORDED WOULD BIND THE SOVEREIGN IN HIS EXECUTIVE CAPACITY ONLY
1536-138488-0015 THIS WAS INDEED EVIDENT FROM THE VERY NATURE OF THE TRANSACTION
1536-138488-0016 IT WAS NEVER DOUBTED BY THE MOST RIGID CASUIST
1536-138488-0017 MAY LAWFULLY WITHHOLD PAYMENT IF THE CREDITOR IS WILLING TO CANCEL THE OBLIGATION
1536-138488-0018 AND WAS RAPIDLY PASSED THROUGH EVERY STAGE
1536-138488-0019 PROVIDED ALWAYS THAT EPISCOPACY AND A WRITTEN FORM OF PRAYER WERE RETAINED THE GROSS ABSURDITY OF THIS MOTION WAS EXPOSED BY SEVERAL EMINENT MEMBERS SUCH A CLAUSE THEY JUSTLY REMARKED WOULD BIND THE KING UNDER PRETENCE OF SETTING HIM FREE THE CORONATION OATH THEY SAID
1536-138488-0020 WAS NEVER INTENDED TO TRAMMEL HIM IN HIS LEGISLATIVE CAPACITY LEAVE THAT OATH AS IT IS NOW DRAWN AND NO PRINCE CAN MISUNDERSTAND IT NO PRINCE CAN SERIOUSLY IMAGINE THAT THE TWO HOUSES MEAN TO EXACT FROM HIM A PROMISE THAT HE WILL PUT A VETO ON LAWS
1536-138488-0021 WHICH THEY MAY HEREAFTER THINK NECESSARY TO THE WELLBEING OF THE COUNTRY OR IF ANY PRINCE SHOULD SO STRANGELY MISAPPREHEND THE NATURE OF THE CONTRACT BETWEEN HIM AND HIS SUBJECTS ANY DIVINE ANY LAWYER
1536-138488-0022 TO WHOSE ADVICE HE MAY HAVE RECOURSE WILL SET HIS MIND AT EASE BUT IF THIS RIDER SHOULD PASS IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY THAT THE CORONATION OATH IS MEANT TO PREVENT THE KING FROM GIVING HIS ASSENT TO BILLS WHICH MAY BE PRESENTED TO HIM BY THE LORDS AND COMMONS
1536-138488-0023 THAT THE STATESMEN WHO FRAMED THE CORONATION OATH
1536-138488-0024 A CONJUNCTURE SINGULARLY AUSPICIOUS A CONJUNCTURE AT WHICH WISDOM AND JUSTICE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE RECONCILED RACES AND SECTS LONG HOSTILE AND MIGHT HAVE MADE THE BRITISH ISLANDS ONE TRULY UNITED KINGDOM WAS SUFFERED TO PASS AWAY THE OPPORTUNITY ONCE LOST RETURNED NO MORE
1536-138488-0025 TWO GENERATIONS OF PUBLIC MEN HAVE SINCE LABOURED WITH IMPERFECT SUCCESS TO REPAIR THE ERROR WHICH WAS THEN COMMITTED NOR IS IT IMPROBABLE THAT SOME OF THE PENALTIES OF THAT ERROR MAY CONTINUE TO AFFLICT A REMOTE POSTERITY THE BILL BY WHICH THE OATH WAS SETTLED PASSED THE UPPER HOUSE WITHOUT AMENDMENT
1536-138488-0026 ALL THE PREPARATIONS WERE COMPLETE AND ON THE ELEVENTH OF APRIL THE CORONATION TOOK PLACE IN SOME THINGS IT DIFFERED FROM ORDINARY CORONATIONS THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE ATTENDED THE CEREMONY IN A BODY AND WERE SUMPTUOUSLY FEASTED IN THE EXCHEQUER CHAMBER
1536-138488-0027 MARY BEING NOT MERELY QUEEN CONSORT BUT ALSO QUEEN REGNANT WAS INAUGURATED IN ALL THINGS LIKE A KING WAS GIRT WITH THE SWORD LIFTED UP INTO THE THRONE AND PRESENTED WITH THE BIBLE THE SPURS AND THE ORB OF THE TEMPORAL GRANDEES OF THE REALM AND OF THEIR WIVES AND DAUGHTERS
1536-138488-0028 THE MUSTER WAS GREAT AND SPLENDID NONE COULD BE SURPRISED THAT THE WHIG ARISTOCRACY SHOULD SWELL THE TRIUMPH OF WHIG PRINCIPLES BUT THE JACOBITES SAW WITH CONCERN THAT MANY LORDS WHO HAD VOTED FOR A REGENCY BORE A CONSPICUOUS PART IN THE CEREMONIAL
1536-138488-0029 THE KING'S CROWN WAS CARRIED BY GRAFTON THE QUEEN'S BY SOMERSET THE POINTED SWORD EMBLEMATICAL OF TEMPORAL JUSTICE WAS BORNE BY PEMBROKE ORMOND WAS LORD HIGH CONSTABLE FOR THE DAY AND RODE UP THE HALL ON THE RIGHT HAND OF THE HEREDITARY CHAMPION
1536-138488-0030 WHO THRICE FLUNG DOWN HIS GLOVE ON THE PAVEMENT AND THRICE DEFIED TO MORTAL COMBAT THE FALSE TRAITOR WHO SHOULD GAINSAY THE TITLE OF WILLIAM AND MARY AMONG THE NOBLE DAMSELS WHO SUPPORTED THE GORGEOUS TRAIN OF THE QUEEN WAS HER BEAUTIFUL AND GENTLE COUSIN THE LADY HENRIETTA HYDE WHOSE FATHER ROCHESTER
1536-138488-0031 THE PRIMATE DID NOT MAKE HIS APPEARANCE AND HIS PLACE WAS SUPPLIED BY COMPTON
1536-138488-0032 ON THE OTHER SIDE SPRAT BISHOP OF ROCHESTER LATELY A MEMBER OF THE HIGH COMMISSION HAD CHARGE OF THE CHALICE BURNET THE JUNIOR PRELATE PREACHED WITH ALL HIS WONTED ABILITY AND MORE THAN HIS WONTED TASTE AND JUDGMENT
1536-138488-0033 HIS GRAVE AND ELOQUENT DISCOURSE WAS POLLUTED NEITHER BY ADULATION NOR BY MALIGNITY
1536-138488-0034 WITH LONG LIFE AND MUTUAL LOVE WITH OBEDIENT SUBJECTS WISE COUNSELLORS AND FAITHFUL ALLIES WITH GALLANT FLEETS AND ARMIES WITH VICTORY WITH PEACE AND FINALLY WITH CROWNS MORE GLORIOUS AND MORE DURABLE THAN THOSE WHICH THEN GLITTERED ON THE ALTAR OF THE ABBEY
1536-138488-0035 FAINT INDEED AND TRANSIENT OF THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE PRECEDING DECEMBER THE DAY WAS IN LONDON AND IN MANY OTHER PLACES A DAY OF GENERAL REJOICING THE CHURCHES WERE FILLED IN THE MORNING THE AFTERNOON WAS SPENT IN SPORT AND CAROUSING
1536-138488-0036 AND AT NIGHT BONFIRES WERE LIGHTED ROCKETS DISCHARGED AND WINDOWS LIGHTED UP THE JACOBITES HOWEVER CONTRIVED TO DISCOVER OR TO INVENT ABUNDANT MATTER FOR SCURRILITY AND SARCASM THEY COMPLAINED BITTERLY THAT THE WAY FROM THE HALL TO THE WESTERN DOOR OF THE ABBEY HAD BEEN LINED BY DUTCH SOLDIERS
1536-138488-0037 WAS IT SEEMLY THAT AN ENGLISH KING SHOULD ENTER INTO THE MOST SOLEMN OF ENGAGEMENTS WITH THE ENGLISH NATION BEHIND A TRIPLE HEDGE OF FOREIGN SWORDS AND BAYONETS LITTLE AFFRAYS SUCH AS AT EVERY GREAT PAGEANT ALMOST INEVITABLY TAKE PLACE BETWEEN THOSE WHO ARE EAGER TO SEE THE SHOW
1536-138488-0038 AND THOSE WHOSE BUSINESS IT IS TO KEEP THE COMMUNICATIONS CLEAR WERE EXAGGERATED WITH ALL THE ARTIFICES OF RHETORIC ONE OF THE ALIEN MERCENARIES HAD BACKED HIS HORSE AGAINST AN HONEST CITIZEN WHO PRESSED FORWARD TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE ROYAL CANOPY
1536-138488-0039 ANOTHER HAD RUDELY PUSHED BACK A WOMAN WITH THE BUT END OF HIS MUSKET ON SUCH GROUNDS AS THESE THE STRANGERS WERE COMPARED TO THOSE LORD DANES WHOSE INSOLENCE IN THE OLD TIME HAD PROVOKED THE ANGLO SAXON POPULATION TO INSURRECTION AND MASSACRE
1536-138488-0040 BUT THERE WAS NO MORE FERTILE THEME FOR CENSURE THAN THE CORONATION MEDAL WHICH REALLY WAS ABSURD IN DESIGN AND MEAN IN EXECUTION A CHARIOT APPEARED CONSPICUOUS ON THE REVERSE AND PLAIN PEOPLE WERE AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS EMBLEM HAD TO DO WITH WILLIAM AND MARY
1536-138488-0041 THE DISAFFECTED WITS SOLVED THE DIFFICULTY BY SUGGESTING THAT THE ARTIST MEANT TO ALLUDE TO THAT CHARIOT WHICH A ROMAN PRINCESS LOST TO ALL FILIAL AFFECTION AND BLINDLY DEVOTED TO THE INTERESTS OF AN AMBITIOUS HUSBAND
1536-138488-0042 THREE GARTERS WHICH HAPPENED TO BE AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE CROWN WERE GIVEN TO DEVONSHIRE ORMOND AND SCHOMBERG PRINCE GEORGE WAS CREATED DUKE OF CUMBERLAND SEVERAL EMINENT MEN TOOK NEW APPELLATIONS BY WHICH THEY MUST HENCEFORTH BE DESIGNATED
1536-138488-0043 DANBY BECAME MARQUESS OF CAERMARTHEN CHURCHILL EARL OF MARLBOROUGH
1536-138488-0044 EARL OF PORTLAND MORDAUNT WAS MADE EARL OF MONMOUTH NOT WITHOUT SOME MURMURING ON THE PART OF OLD EXCLUSIONISTS WHO STILL REMEMBERED WITH FONDNESS THEIR PROTESTANT DUKE AND WHO HAD HOPED THAT HIS ATTAINDER WOULD BE REVERSED AND THAT HIS TITLE WOULD BE BORNE BY HIS DESCENDANTS
1536-138488-0045 IT WAS REMARKED THAT THE NAME OF HALIFAX DID NOT APPEAR IN THE LIST OF PROMOTIONS NONE COULD DOUBT THAT HE MIGHT EASILY HAVE OBTAINED EITHER A BLUE RIBAND OR A DUCAL CORONET AND THOUGH HE WAS HONOURABLY DISTINGUISHED FROM MOST OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES BY HIS SCORN OF ILLICIT GAIN
1536-138488-0046 IT WAS WELL KNOWN THAT HE DESIRED HONORARY DISTINCTIONS WITH A GREEDINESS OF WHICH HE WAS HIMSELF ASHAMED AND WHICH WAS UNWORTHY OF HIS FINE UNDERSTANDING THE TRUTH IS THAT HIS AMBITION WAS AT THIS TIME CHILLED BY HIS FEARS
1536-138488-0047 TO THOSE WHOM HE TRUSTED HE HINTED HIS APPREHENSIONS THAT EVIL TIMES WERE AT HAND THE KING'S LIFE WAS NOT WORTH A YEAR'S PURCHASE THE GOVERNMENT WAS DISJOINTED
1536-138488-0048 THE PARLIAMENT TORN BY FACTIONS CIVIL WAR WAS ALREADY RAGING IN ONE PART OF THE EMPIRE FOREIGN WAR WAS IMPENDING AT SUCH A MOMENT A MINISTER WHETHER WHIG OR TORY MIGHT WELL BE UNEASY BUT NEITHER WHIG NOR TORY HAD SO MUCH TO FEAR AS THE TRIMMER
1536-138488-0049 PERSONS WHOSE GRATITUDE MIGHT BE USEFUL IN THE EVENT OF A COUNTERREVOLUTION
