7982-110054-0000 OF PROPRIETY AS REGARDS ONE'S SELF ATTENTION TO ONE'S PERSON AND REPUTATION IS ALSO A DUTY IF VANITY PRIDE OR PRUDERY
7982-110054-0001 HAVE FREQUENTLY GIVEN TO THESE ATTENTIONS THE NAMES OF COQUETRY AMBITION OR FOLLY THIS IS A STILL STRONGER REASON WHY WE SHOULD ENDEAVOR TO CLEAR UP THESE POINTS
7982-110054-0002 FOR A LADY A SMALL MUSLIN CAP BONNET DE PERCALE A CAMISOLE OR COMMON ROBE IT IS WELL THAT A HALF CORSET SHOULD PRECEDE THE FULL CORSET WHICH LAST IS USED ONLY WHEN ONE IS DRESSED
7982-110054-0003 THE HAIR PAPERS WHICH CANNOT BE REMOVED ON RISING BECAUSE THE HAIR WOULD NOT KEEP IN CURL TILL EVENING SHOULD BE CONCEALED UNDER A BANDEAU OF LACE OR OF THE HAIR
7982-110054-0004 THEY SHOULD BE REMOVED AS SOON AS MAY BE IN THIS DRESS WE CAN RECEIVE ONLY INTIMATE FRIENDS OR PERSONS WHO CALL UPON URGENT OR INDISPENSABLE BUSINESS EVEN THEN WE OUGHT TO OFFER SOME APOLOGY FOR IT
7982-110054-0005 IT IS WELL TO IMPOSE UPON YOURSELF A RULE TO BE DRESSED AT SOME PARTICULAR HOUR THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE SINCE OCCUPATIONS WILL PRESENT THEMSELVES TO HINDER YOUR BEING READY FOR THE DAY AND YOU WILL EASILY ACQUIRE THE HABIT OF THIS
7982-110054-0006 SUCH DISORDER OF THE TOILET CAN BE EXCUSED WHEN IT OCCURS RARELY OR FOR A SHORT TIME AS IN SUCH CASES IT SEEMS EVIDENTLY OWING TO A TEMPORARY EMBARRASSMENT BUT IF IT OCCUR DAILY OR CONSTANTLY
7982-110054-0007 IF IT SEEMS THE RESULT OF NEGLIGENCE AND SLOVENLINESS IT IS UNPARDONABLE PARTICULARLY IN LADIES WHOSE DRESS SEEMS LESS DESIGNED FOR CLOTHING THAN ORNAMENT
7982-110054-0008 TO SUPPOSE THAT GREAT HEAT OF WEATHER WILL AUTHORISE THIS DISORDER OF THE TOILET AND WILL PERMIT US TO GO IN SLIPPERS OR WITH OUR LEGS AND ARMS BARE OR TO TAKE NONCHALANT OR IMPROPER ATTITUDES
7982-110054-0009 WE MUST GIVE DIRECTIONS THAT WE ARE NOT AT HOME ON THE OTHER HAND TO THINK THAT COLD AND RAINY WEATHER EXCUSES LIKE LIBERTIES IS EQUALLY AN ERROR YOU OUGHT NOT TO BE IN THE HABIT OF WEARING LARGE SOCKS
7982-110054-0010 GALOCHES LINED WITH FUR
7982-110054-0011 THIS CUSTOM IS IN THE WORST TASTE WHEN YOU GO TO SEE ANY ONE YOU CANNOT DISPENSE WITH TAKING OFF YOUR SOCKS OR CLOGS BEFORE YOU ARE INTRODUCED INTO THE ROOM
7982-110054-0012 NEITHER WITH AN APRON NOR CAP EVEN IF IT IS MADE OF FINE CLOTH AND TRIMMED WITH RIBBANDS NOR SHOULD A WELL BRED MAN SHOW HIMSELF IN THE STREET IN A WAISTCOAT ONLY
7982-110054-0013 ALL THE DETAILS OF WHICH WE CANNOT GIVE ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR MULTIPLICITY AND THE NUMEROUS MODIFICATION OF FASHION WE SHALL ONLY SAY THAT LADIES GENERALLY SHOULD MAKE THESE CALLS IN THE DRESS WHICH THEY WEAR AT HOME
7982-110054-0014 GENTLEMEN MAY CALL IN AN OUTSIDE COAT IN BOOTS AND PANTALOONS AS WHEN THEY ARE ON THEIR ORDINARY BUSINESS IN SHORT THIS DRESS IS PROPER FOR GENTLEMEN'S VISITS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
7982-110054-0015 WITH REGARD TO LADIES IT IS NECESSARY FOR THEM WHEN VISITING AT THIS TIME TO ARRANGE THEIR TOILET WITH MORE CARE CEREMONIOUS VISITS EVENING VISITS AND ESPECIALLY BALLS
7982-110054-0016 AND FOR NO OTHER SUCH AS RICH BLOND CAPS ORNAMENTED WITH FLOWERS
7982-110054-0017 APPROPRIATE TO THE DRAWING ROOM THE NICEST CLOTH NEW AND VERY FINE LINEN AN ELEGANT BUT PLAIN WAISTCOAT A BEAUTIFUL WATCH TO WHICH IS ATTACHED A SINGLE COSTLY KEY
7982-110054-0018 AND THOSE IN THE PROFESSION OF THE LAW SHOULD AVOID HAVING A FASHIONABLE OR MILITARY COSTUME WHICH IS GENERALLY ADOPTED BY STUDENTS COMMERCIAL MEN
7982-110054-0019 AND SHOULD BE LESS SHOWY THAN THAT OF MARRIED LADIES COSTLY CASHMERES VERY RICH FURS AND DIAMONDS AS WELL AS MANY OTHER BRILLIANT ORNAMENTS ARE TO BE FORBIDDEN A YOUNG LADY
7982-110054-0020 AND THOSE WHO ACT IN DEFIANCE OF THESE RATIONAL MARKS OF PROPRIETY MAKE US BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE POSSESSED OF AN UNRESTRAINED LOVE OF LUXURY AND DEPRIVE THEMSELVES OF THE PLEASURE OF RECEIVING THESE ORNAMENTS FROM THE HAND OF THE MAN OF THEIR CHOICE
7982-110054-0021 ALL LADIES CANNOT USE INDISCRIMINATELY THE PRIVILEGE WHICH MARRIAGE CONFERS UPON THEM IN THIS RESPECT AND THE TOILET OF THOSE WHOSE FORTUNE IS MODERATE SHOULD NOT PASS THE BOUNDS OF AN ELEGANT SIMPLICITY
7982-110054-0022 CONSIDERATIONS OF A MORE ELEVATED NATURE AS OF GOOD DOMESTIC ORDER THE DIGNITY OF A WIFE AND THE DUTIES OF A MOTHER COME IN SUPPORT OF THIS LAW OF PROPRIETY FOR IT CONCERNS MORALITY IN ALL ITS BRANCHES
7982-110054-0023 WE MUST BEWARE OF A SHOAL IN THIS CASE FREQUENTLY A YOUNG LADY OF SMALL FORTUNE DESIRING TO APPEAR DECENTLY IN ANY SPLENDID ASSEMBLY MAKES SACRIFICES IN ORDER TO EMBELLISH HER MODEST ATTIRE
7982-110054-0024 MOREOVER WHATEVER BE THE OPULENCE WHICH YOU ENJOY LUXURY ENCROACHES SO MUCH UPON IT THAT NO RICHES ARE ABLE TO SATISFY ITS DEMANDS BUT FORTUNATELY PROPRIETY ALWAYS IN ACCORDANCE WITH REASON
7982-110054-0025 THE RULES SUITABLE TO AGE RESEMBLE THOSE WHICH MEDIOCRITY OF FORTUNE IMPOSES FOR INSTANCE OLD LADIES OUGHT TO ABSTAIN FROM GAUDY COLORS
7982-110054-0026 THE RIGOROUS SIMPLICITY OF THE DRESS OF MEN ESTABLISHES BUT VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT OF YOUNG AND OLD THE LATTER HOWEVER OUGHT TO CHOOSE GRAVE COLORS NOT TO FOLLOW THE FASHIONS TOO CLOSELY
7982-110054-0027 TO AVOID GARMENTS TOO TIGHT OR TOO SHORT AND NOT TO HAVE IN VIEW IN THEIR TOILET ANY OTHER OBJECT BUT EASE AND NEATNESS UNLESS THE CARE OF THEIR HEALTH OR COMPLETE BALDNESS REQUIRES THEM TO WEAR A WIG EIGHT
7982-110054-0028 IT IS MORE PROPER THAT OLD PERSONS SHOULD SHOW THEIR WHITE AND NOBLE HEADS OLD LADIES
7982-110054-0029 SHOULD AT LEAST AVOID HAIR TOO THICK OR TOO FULL OF CURLS IF THEY WOULD NOT APPEAR RIDICULOUS AND CLOTHED IN A MANNER DISAGREEABLE OR OFFENSIVE
7982-110054-0030 LADIES OUGHT TO ADOPT IN SUMMER LIGHT GARMENTS AND DELICATE COLORS
7982-110054-0031 THEY MUST SELECT STUFFS FOR WINTER OR SUMMER AS MAY BE SUITABLE
7982-110054-0032 AN OUTER GARMENT OVER THE COAT ESPECIALLY ONE OF SILK IS LEFT FOR MEN OF A CERTAIN AGE IT ONLY BELONGS TO SEPTUAGENARIANS AND ECCLESIASTICS TO WEAR DOUBLETS OR WADDED OUTER COATS
7982-110054-0033 TO FINISH OUR INSTRUCTIONS RELATIVE TO THE TOILET IT ONLY REMAINS FOR US TO MAKE A FEW OBSERVATIONS IT IS SUPERLATIVELY RIDICULOUS FOR A LADY TO GO ON FOOT
7982-110054-0034 WHO DOES NOT PERCEIVE HOW LAUGHABLE IT IS TO SEE A LADY WHO IS CLOTHED IN SATIN LACE OR VELVET LABORIOUSLY TRAVELLING IN THE DUST OR MUD
7982-110054-0035 VARY YOUR TOILET AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FOR FEAR THAT IDLERS AND MALIGNANT WITS WHO ARE ALWAYS A MAJORITY IN THE WORLD SHOULD AMUSE THEMSELVES BY MAKING YOUR DRESS THE DESCRIPTION OF YOUR PERSON
7982-110054-0036 CERTAIN FASHIONABLES SEEK TO GAIN A KIND OF REPUTATION BY THE ODD CHOICE OF THEIR ATTIRE AND BY THEIR EAGERNESS TO SEIZE UPON THE FIRST CAPRICES OF THE FASHIONS
7982-110054-0037 DIRECT OUR THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS IN THIS POINT OF VIEW WE SEE THAT A REGARD TO REPUTATION IS THE NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF THE DUTIES OF PROPRIETY TOWARD ONE'S SELF
7982-110054-0038 THEY ARE OBTAINED BY THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR OBLIGATIONS OF FAMILY AND OF OUR PROFESSION BY OUR PROBITY AND GOOD MANNERS BY OUR FORTUNE AND SITUATION IN SOCIETY
7982-110054-0039 CONSIDERATION IS NOT ACQUIRED BY WORDS AN ARTICLE SO PRECIOUS DEMANDS A REAL VALUE IT DEMANDS ALSO THE ASSISTANCE OF DISCRETION
7982-110054-0040 SO THAT WE MUST BEGIN BY FULFILLING EXACTLY OUR DUTIES TOWARDS RELATIONS BUT WE MUST BEWARE OF MAKING PUBLIC THOSE PETTY QUARRELS AND LITTLE DIFFERENCES OF INTEREST OF ILL HUMOR OR OPINION
7982-110054-0041 THAT POWERFUL MEANS OF OBTAINING CONSIDERATION BY ITS ELEVATED AND RELIGIOUS NATURE IS NOT WITHIN OUR INVESTIGATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF POLITENESS
7982-110054-0042 IN REGARD TO CHASTITY THERE EXISTS INDEPENDENTLY OF GOOD CONDUCT A MULTITUDE OF CARES AND PRECAUTIONS WHICH HOWEVER MINUTE AND EMBARRASSING AT TIMES OUGHT NEVER TO BE NEGLECTED
7982-110054-0043 LADIES TO WHOM THE ADVICE CONTAINED IN THIS PARAGRAPH IS PARTICULARLY ADDRESSED KNOW HOW THE SHADOW OF SUSPICION WITHERS AND TORMENTS THEM THIS SHADOW IT IS NECESSARY TO AVOID AT ALL HAZARDS
7982-110054-0044 OR AN AGED LADY THEY ARE AT LIBERTY HOWEVER TO WALK WITH YOUNG MARRIED LADIES OR UNMARRIED ONES WHILE THE LATTER SHOULD NEVER WALK ALONE WITH THEIR COMPANIONS
7982-110054-0045 NEITHER SHOULD THEY SHOW THEMSELVES EXCEPT WITH A GENTLEMAN OF THEIR FAMILY AND THEN HE SHOULD BE A NEAR RELATION OR OF RESPECTABLE AGE EXCEPT IN CERTAIN PROVINCIAL TOWNS WHERE THERE IS A GREAT STRICTNESS IN BEHAVIOR
7982-110054-0046 UNLESS SHE GOES THERE TO STUDY OR WORK AS AN ARTIST A LADY OUGHT TO HAVE A MODEST AND MEASURED GAIT TOO GREAT HURRY INJURES THE GRACE WHICH OUGHT TO CHARACTERIZE HER
7982-110054-0047 SHE SHOULD TAKE GOOD CARE NOT TO ANSWER THEM A WORD IF THEY PERSIST SHE SHOULD TELL THEM IN A BRIEF AND FIRM THOUGH POLITE TONE THAT SHE DESIRES TO BE LEFT TO HERSELF IF A MAN FOLLOW HER IN SILENCE
7982-110054-0048 SHE SHOULD PRETEND NOT TO PERCEIVE HIM AND AT THE SAME TIME HASTEN A LITTLE HER STEP TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE DAY A YOUNG LADY WOULD CONDUCT HERSELF IN AN UNBECOMING MANNER IF SHE SHOULD GO ALONE
7982-110054-0049 AND CONSEQUENTLY AN OBLIGATION A MARRIED LADY WELL EDUCATED WILL DISREGARD IT IF CIRCUMSTANCES PREVENT HER BEING ABLE WITHOUT TROUBLE TO FIND A CONDUCTOR IF THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WISHES TO ACCOMPANY YOU HIMSELF
7982-110054-0050 YOU MUST EXCUSE YOURSELF POLITELY FROM GIVING HIM SO MUCH TROUBLE BUT FINISH HOWEVER BY ACCEPTING ON ARRIVING AT YOUR HOUSE YOU SHOULD OFFER HIM YOUR THANKS IN ORDER TO AVOID THESE TWO INCONVENIENCES
7982-110054-0051 IT WILL BE WELL TO REQUEST YOUR HUSBAND OR SOME ONE OF YOUR RELATIONS TO COME AND WAIT UPON YOU YOU WILL IN THIS WAY AVOID STILL ANOTHER INCONVENIENCE IN SMALL TOWNS WHERE MALICE IS EXCITED BY IGNORANCE AND WANT OF SOMETHING TO DO
