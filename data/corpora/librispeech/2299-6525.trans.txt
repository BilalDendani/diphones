2299-6525-0000 THE SKI RUN WAS COMPLETELY CUT THROUGH IN TWO PLACES THE GAP AND OBSERVATION HILL ALMOST BARE A GREAT BARE SLOPE ON THE SIDE OF ARRIVAL HEIGHTS AND ON TOP OF CRATER HEIGHTS AN IMMENSE BARE TABLE LAND HOW DELIGHTED
2299-6525-0001 WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TO SEE IT LIKE THIS IN THE OLD DAYS THE POND WAS THAWED
2299-6525-0002 THE HOLE WHICH WE HAD DUG IN THE MOUND IN THE POND WAS STILL THERE AS MEARES DISCOVERED BY FALLING INTO IT UP TO HIS WAIST AND GETTING VERY WET ON THE SOUTH SIDE WE COULD SEE THE PRESSURE RIDGES BEYOND PRAM POINT AS OF OLD HORSESHOE BAY CALM AND UNPRESSED
2299-6525-0003 THE SEA ICE PRESSED ON PRAM POINT AND ALONG THE GAP ICE FOOT AND A NEW RIDGE RUNNING AROUND C ARMITAGE ABOUT TWO MILES OFF WE SAW FERRAR'S OLD THERMOMETER TUBES STANDING OUT OF THE SNOW SLOPE AS THOUGH THEY'D BEEN PLACED YESTERDAY
2299-6525-0004 THE FLAGSTAFF WAS DOWN THE STAYS HAVING CARRIED AWAY BUT IN FIVE MINUTES IT COULD BE PUT UP AGAIN WE LOADED SOME ASBESTOS SHEETING FROM THE OLD MAGNETIC HUT ON OUR SLEDGES FOR SIMPSON
2299-6525-0005 GOT A CLEAR RUN TO GLACIER TONGUE I HAD HOPED TO GET ACROSS THE WIDE CRACK BY GOING WEST
2299-6525-0006 I FOUND OUR LARDER IN THE GROTTO COMPLETED AND STORED WITH MUTTON AND PENGUINS
2299-6525-0007 I TOOK PONTING OUT TO SEE SOME INTERESTING THAW EFFECTS ON THE ICE CLIFFS EAST OF THE CAMP I NOTED THAT THE ICE LAYERS WERE PRESSING OUT OVER THIN DIRT BANDS AS THOUGH THE LATTER MADE THE CLEAVAGE LINES OVER WHICH THE STRATA SLID
2299-6525-0008 I HEARD THAT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO JOURNEYED TOWARDS C ROYDS YESTERDAY REACHED THEIR DESTINATION IN SAFETY CAMPBELL LEVICK AND PRIESTLEY HAD JUST DEPARTED
2299-6525-0009 WE TOOK UP OUR ABODE IN THE HUT TO DAY AND ARE SIMPLY OVERWHELMED WITH ITS COMFORT AFTER BREAKFAST THIS MORNING I FOUND BOWERS MAKING CUBICLES AS I HAD ARRANGED BUT I SOON SAW THESE WOULD NOT FIT IN SO INSTRUCTED HIM TO BUILD A BULKHEAD OF CASES
2299-6525-0010 WHICH SHUTS OFF THE OFFICERS SPACE FROM THE MEN'S I AM QUITE SURE TO THE SATISFACTION OF BOTH THE SPACE BETWEEN MY BULKHEAD AND THE MEN'S I ALLOTTED TO FIVE BOWERS OATES ATKINSON MEARES AND CHERRY GARRARD
2299-6525-0011 THESE FIVE ARE ALL SPECIAL FRIENDS AND HAVE ALREADY MADE THEIR DORMITORY VERY HABITABLE SIMPSON AND WRIGHT ARE NEAR THE INSTRUMENTS IN THEIR CORNER NEXT COME DAY AND NELSON IN A SPACE WHICH INCLUDES THE LATTER'S LAB NEAR THE BIG WINDOW NEXT TO THIS IS A SPACE FOR THREE
2299-6525-0012 DEBENHAM TAYLOR AND GRAN THEY ALSO HAVE ALREADY MADE THEIR SPACE PART DORMITORY AND PART WORKSHOP IT IS FINE TO SEE THE WAY EVERYONE SETS TO WORK TO PUT THINGS STRAIGHT IN A DAY OR TWO THE HUT WILL BECOME THE MOST COMFORTABLE OF HOUSES AND IN A WEEK OR SO THE WHOLE STATION
2299-6525-0013 IT IS REALLY WONDERFUL TO REALISE THE AMOUNT OF WORK WHICH HAS BEEN GOT THROUGH OF LATE IT WILL BE A FORTNIGHT TO MORROW SINCE WE ARRIVED IN MC MURDO SOUND AND HERE WE ARE ABSOLUTELY SETTLED DOWN AND READY TO START ON OUR DEPOT JOURNEY
2299-6525-0014 DIRECTLY THE PONIES HAVE HAD A PROPER CHANCE TO RECOVER FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE VOYAGE I HAD NO IDEA WE SHOULD BE SO EXPEDITIOUS IT SNOWED HARD ALL LAST NIGHT THERE WERE ABOUT THREE OR FOUR INCHES OF SOFT SNOW OVER THE CAMP THIS MORNING
2299-6525-0015 AND SIMPSON TELLS ME SOME SIX INCHES OUT BY THE SHIP THE CAMP LOOKS VERY WHITE DURING THE DAY IT HAS BEEN BLOWING VERY HARD FROM THE SOUTH WITH A GREAT DEAL OF DRIFT HERE IN THIS CAMP AS USUAL WE DO NOT FEEL IT MUCH BUT WE SEE THE ANEMOMETER RACING ON THE HILL AND THE SNOW CLOUDS SWEEPING PAST THE SHIP
2299-6525-0016 THE FLOE IS BREAKING BETWEEN THE POINT AND THE SHIP THOUGH CURIOUSLY IT REMAINS FAST ON A DIRECT ROUTE TO THE SHIP NOW THE OPEN WATER RUNS PARALLEL TO OUR SHIP ROAD AND ONLY A FEW HUNDRED YARDS SOUTH OF IT YESTERDAY THE WHALER WAS ROWED IN CLOSE TO THE CAMP
2299-6525-0017 THE BIG WEDGE OF ICE TO WHICH THE SHIP IS HOLDING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE BAY CAN HAVE VERY LITTLE GRIP TO KEEP IT IN AND MUST INEVITABLY GO OUT VERY SOON I HOPE THIS MAY RESULT IN THE SHIP FINDING A MORE SHELTERED
2299-6525-0018 AND SECURE POSITION CLOSE TO US A BIG ICEBERG SAILED PAST THE SHIP THIS AFTERNOON ATKINSON DECLARES IT WAS THE END OF THE CAPE BARNE GLACIER I HOPE THEY WILL KNOW IN THE SHIP AS IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO WITNESS THE BIRTH OF A GLACIER IN THIS REGION
2299-6525-0019 IT IS CLEARING TO NIGHT BUT STILL BLOWING HARD THE PONIES DON'T LIKE THE WIND BUT THEY ARE ALL STANDING THE COLD WONDERFULLY AND ALL THEIR SORES ARE HEALED UP
2299-6525-0020 THE SHIP HAD A POOR TIME LAST NIGHT STEAM WAS ORDERED BUT THE FLOE BEGAN BREAKING UP FAST AT ONE A M AND THE REST OF THE NIGHT WAS PASSED IN STRUGGLING WITH ICE ANCHORS STEAM WAS REPORTED READY JUST AS THE SHIP BROKE ADRIFT
2299-6525-0021 IN THE MORNING SHE SECURED TO THE ICE EDGE ON THE SAME LINE AS BEFORE BUT A FEW HUNDRED YARDS NEARER AFTER GETTING THINGS GOING AT THE HUT I WALKED OVER AND SUGGESTED THAT PENNELL SHOULD COME ROUND THE CORNER CLOSE IN SHORE THE ICE ANCHORS WERE TRIPPED AND WE STEAMED SLOWLY IN
2299-6525-0022 MAKING FAST TO THE FLOE WITHIN TWO HUNDRED YARDS OF THE ICE FOOT AND FOUR HUNDRED YARDS OF THE HUT FOR THE PRESENT THE POSITION IS EXTRAORDINARILY COMFORTABLE
2299-6525-0023 RECEIVING GREAT SHELTER FROM THE END OF THE CAPE WITH A NORTHERLY BLOW SHE MIGHT TURN RATHER CLOSE TO THE SHORE WHERE THE SOUNDINGS RUN TO THREE FATHOMS BUT BEHIND SUCH A STRETCH OF ICE SHE COULD SCARCELY GET A SEA OR SWELL WITHOUT WARNING
2299-6525-0024 IT LOOKS A WONDERFULLY COMFORTABLE LITTLE NOOK BUT OF COURSE ONE CAN BE CERTAIN OF NOTHING IN THIS PLACE ONE KNOWS FROM EXPERIENCE HOW DECEPTIVE THE APPEARANCE OF SECURITY MAY BE PENNELL IS TRULY EXCELLENT IN HIS PRESENT POSITION
2299-6525-0025 HE'S INVARIABLY CHEERFUL UNCEASINGLY WATCHFUL AND CONTINUOUSLY READY FOR EMERGENCIES I HAVE COME TO POSSESS IMPLICIT CONFIDENCE IN HIM
2299-6525-0026 IT WAS VERY UNPLEASANT OUTSIDE AFTER BREAKFAST
2299-6525-0027 THIS AFTERNOON IT FELL ALMOST CALM BUT THE SKY CLOUDED OVER AGAIN AND NOW THERE IS A GENTLE WARM SOUTHERLY BREEZE WITH LIGHT FALLING SNOW AND AN OVERCAST SKY
2299-6525-0028 THE POSITION OF THE SHIP MAKES THE CASUAL TRANSPORT THAT STILL PROCEEDS VERY EASY BUT THE ICE IS RATHER THIN AT THE EDGE IN THE HUT ALL IS MARCHING TOWARDS THE UTMOST COMFORT BOWERS HAS COMPLETED A STOREROOM ON THE SOUTH SIDE AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO KEEP OUR TRAVELLING PROVISIONS
2299-6525-0029 EVERY DAY HE CONCEIVES OR CARRIES OUT SOME PLAN TO BENEFIT THE CAMP SIMPSON AND WRIGHT ARE WORTHY OF ALL ADMIRATION THEY HAVE BEEN UNCEASINGLY ACTIVE IN GETTING THINGS TO THE FORE
2299-6525-0030 BUT INDEED IT IS HARD TO SPECIALISE PRAISE WHERE EVERYONE IS WORKING SO INDEFATIGABLY FOR THE CAUSE EACH MAN IN HIS WAY IS A TREASURE CLISSOLD THE COOK HAS STARTED SPLENDIDLY HAS SERVED SEAL PENGUIN AND SKUA NOW
2299-6525-0031 AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT I HAVE NEVER MET THESE ARTICLES OF FOOD IN SUCH A PLEASING GUISE THIS POINT IS OF THE GREATEST PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE AS IT MEANS THE CERTAINTY OF GOOD HEALTH FOR ANY NUMBER OF YEARS HOOPER WAS LANDED TO DAY MUCH TO HIS JOY HE GOT TO WORK AT ONCE AND WILL BE A SPLENDID HELP
2299-6525-0032 FREEING THE SCIENTIFIC PEOPLE OF ALL DIRTY WORK ANTON AND DEMETRI ARE BOTH MOST ANXIOUS TO HELP ON ALL OCCASIONS THEY ARE EXCELLENT BOYS
2299-6525-0033 THE HUT IS BECOMING THE MOST COMFORTABLE DWELLING PLACE IMAGINABLE WE HAVE MADE UNTO OURSELVES A TRULY SEDUCTIVE HOME WITHIN THE WALLS OF WHICH PEACE QUIET AND COMFORT REIGN SUPREME SUCH A NOBLE DWELLING TRANSCENDS THE WORD HUT
2299-6525-0034 AND WE PAUSE TO GIVE IT A MORE FITTING TITLE ONLY FROM LACK OF THE APPROPRIATE SUGGESTION
2299-6525-0035 IF YOU CAN PICTURE OUR HOUSE NESTLING BELOW THIS SMALL HILL ON A LONG STRETCH OF BLACK SAND
2299-6525-0036 CASES RANGED IN NEAT BLOCKS IN FRONT OF IT AND THE SEA LAPPING THE ICEFOOT BELOW
2299-6525-0037 AS FOR OUR WIDER SURROUNDINGS IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE THEIR BEAUTY IN SUFFICIENTLY GLOWING TERMS CAPE EVANS IS ONE OF THE MANY SPURS OF EREBUS
2299-6525-0038 AND THE ONE THAT STANDS CLOSEST UNDER THE MOUNTAIN SO THAT ALWAYS TOWERING ABOVE US WE HAVE THE GRAND SNOWY PEAK WITH ITS SMOKING SUMMIT NORTH AND SOUTH OF US ARE DEEP BAYS BEYOND WHICH GREAT GLACIERS COME RIPPLING OVER
2299-6525-0039 THE LOWER SLOPES TO THRUST HIGH BLUE WALLED SNOUTS INTO THE SEA
2299-6525-0040 WITH CAMERA AND CINEMATOGRAPH THE WIND HAS BEEN BOISTEROUS ALL DAY TO ADVANTAGE AFTER THE LAST SNOW FALL AS IT HAS BEEN DRIFTING THE LOOSE SNOW ALONG AND HARDENING THE SURFACES THE HORSES DON'T LIKE IT NATURALLY
2299-6525-0041 I THINK THE HARDENING PROCESS MUST BE GOOD FOR ANIMALS THOUGH NOT FOR MEN NATURE REPLIES TO IT IN THE FORMER BY GROWING A THICK COAT WITH WONDERFUL PROMPTITUDE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE SHAGGY COATS OF OUR PONIES ARE ALREADY IMPROVING
2299-6525-0042 THE DOGS SEEM TO FEEL THE COLD LITTLE SO FAR BUT THEY ARE NOT SO EXPOSED
2299-6525-0043 ON THE WINDWARD SIDE CONNECTING THE ROOFING WITH THAT OF THE PORCH THE IMPROVEMENT IS ENORMOUS AND WILL MAKE THE GREATEST DIFFERENCE TO THOSE WHO DWELL NEAR THE DOOR
2299-6525-0044 WHICH WILL BE COMPLETED IN A FEW DAYS INTERNAL AFFAIRS HAVE BEEN STRAIGHTENING OUT AS RAPIDLY AS BEFORE AND EVERY HOUR SEEMS TO ADD SOME NEW TOUCH FOR THE BETTER THIS MORNING I OVERHAULED ALL THE FUR SLEEPING BAGS AND FOUND THEM IN SPLENDID ORDER
2299-6525-0045 PONTING HAS FITTED UP HIS OWN DARK ROOM DOING THE CARPENTERING WORK WITH EXTRAORDINARY SPEED AND TO EVERYONE'S ADMIRATION TO NIGHT HE MADE A WINDOW IN THE DARK ROOM IN AN HOUR OR SO MEARES HAS BECOME ENAMOURED OF THE GRAMOPHONE
2299-6525-0046 WE FIND WE HAVE A SPLENDID SELECTION OF RECORDS THE PIANOLA IS BEING BROUGHT IN SECTIONS
2299-6525-0047 OATES GOES STEADILY ON WITH THE PONIES HE IS PERFECTLY EXCELLENT AND UNTIRING IN HIS DEVOTION TO THE ANIMALS
2299-6525-0048 FOR THIS REASON WE MUST HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF FOOD FOR ANIMALS AND MEN
2299-6525-0049 OUR HOUSE HAS ASSUMED GREAT PROPORTIONS BOWERS ANNEXE IS FINISHED ROOF AND ALL THOROUGHLY SNOW TIGHT AN EXCELLENT PLACE FOR SPARE CLOTHING FURS AND READY USE STORES AND ITS EXTENSION AFFORDING COMPLETE PROTECTION
2299-6525-0050 TO THE ENTRANCE PORCH OF THE HUT THE STABLES ARE NEARLY FINISHED A THOROUGHLY STOUT WELL ROOFED LEAN TO ON THE NORTH SIDE NELSON HAS A SMALL EXTENSION ON THE EAST SIDE
2299-6525-0051 SIMPSON HAS ALMOST COMPLETED HIS ICE CAVERN LIGHT TIGHT LINING NICHES FLOOR AND ALL WRIGHT AND FORDE HAVE ALMOST COMPLETED THE ABSOLUTE HUT A PATCHWORK BUILDING FOR WHICH THE FRAMEWORK ONLY WAS BROUGHT
2299-6525-0052 BUT IT WILL BE VERY WELL ADAPTED FOR OUR NEEDS GRAN HAS BEEN PUTTING RECORD ON THE SKI RUNNERS RECORD IS A MIXTURE OF VEGETABLE TAR PARAFFIN SOFT SOAP AND LINSEED OIL WITH SOME PATENT ADDITION WHICH PREVENTS FREEZING
2299-6525-0053 THIS ACCORDING TO GRAN P O EVANS AND CREAN HAVE BEEN PREPARING SLEDGES EVANS SHOWS HIMSELF WONDERFULLY CAPABLE AND I HAVEN'T A DOUBT AS TO THE WORKING OF THE SLEDGES HE HAS FITTED UP
2299-6525-0054 WE ARE DELIGHTED WITH EVERYTHING FIRST THE FELT BOOTS AND FELT SLIPPERS MADE BY JAEGER AND THEN SUMMER WIND CLOTHES AND FUR MITS NOTHING COULD BE BETTER THAN THESE ARTICLES FINALLY TO NIGHT WE HAVE OVERHAULED AND SERVED OUT TWO PAIRS OF FINNESKO FUR BOOTS
2299-6525-0055 TO EACH TRAVELLER THEY ARE EXCELLENT IN QUALITY
2299-6525-0056 A LITTLE STRETCHING AND ALL WAS WELL THEY ARE VERY GOOD INDEED
2299-6525-0057 WE ARE WELL REPAID FOR ALL THE TROUBLE WHICH WAS TAKEN IN SELECTING THE FOOD LIST AND THE FIRMS FROM WHICH THE VARIOUS ARTICLES COULD BEST BE OBTAINED AND WE ARE SHOWERING BLESSINGS ON MISTER WYATT'S HEAD FOR SO STRICTLY SAFEGUARDING OUR INTERESTS IN THESE PARTICULARS
2299-6525-0058 OUR CLOTHING IS AS GOOD AS GOOD IN FACT FIRST AND LAST RUNNING THROUGH THE WHOLE EXTENT OF OUR OUTFIT I CAN SAY WITH SOME PRIDE THAT THERE IS NOT A SINGLE ARRANGEMENT
2299-6525-0059 AN EMPEROR PENGUIN WAS FOUND ON THE CAPE WELL ADVANCED IN MOULT A GOOD SPECIMEN SKIN ATKINSON FOUND CYSTS FORMED BY A TAPEWORM IN THE INTESTINES IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THIS PARASITE IS NOT TRANSFERRED FROM ANOTHER HOST
2299-6525-0060 AND THAT ITS HISTORY IS UNLIKE THAT OF ANY OTHER KNOWN TAPEWORM IN FACT ATKINSON SCORES A DISCOVERY IN PARASITOLOGY OF NO LITTLE IMPORTANCE THE WIND HAS TURNED TO THE NORTH TO NIGHT AND IS BLOWING QUITE FRESH
2299-6525-0061 THE PIANOLA HAS BEEN ERECTED BY RENNICK HE IS A GOOD FELLOW AND ONE FEELS FOR HIM MUCH AT SUCH A TIME
2299-6525-0062 AND IT SHOWS WELL THAT HE SHOULD GIVE SO MUCH PAINS IN PUTTING IT RIGHT FOR US DAY HAS BEEN EXPLAINING THE MANNER IN WHICH HE HOPES TO BE ABLE TO COPE WITH THE MOTOR SLEDGE DIFFICULTY HE IS HOPEFUL OF GETTING THINGS RIGHT BUT I FEAR IT WON'T DO TO PLACE MORE RELIANCE ON THE MACHINES
2299-6525-0063 EVERYTHING LOOKS HOPEFUL FOR THE DEPOT JOURNEY IF ONLY WE CAN GET OUR STORES AND PONIES PAST THE GLACIER TONGUE
2299-6525-0064 SO EXTRAORDINARILY WELL COOKED
2299-6525-0065 I TOLD TWO OF THE PARTY THEY WERE BEEF
2299-6525-0066 IT IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE TASTED SEAL WITHOUT BEING AWARE OF ITS PARTICULAR FLAVOUR BUT EVEN ITS OWN FLAVOUR IS ACCEPTABLE IN OUR COOK'S HANDS HE REALLY IS EXCELLENT
2299-6525-0067 MY ANXIETY FOR THE SHIP WAS NOT UNFOUNDED FEARING A LITTLE TROUBLE I WENT OUT OF THE HUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND SAW AT ONCE THAT SHE WAS HAVING A BAD TIME THE ICE WAS BREAKING WITH A NORTHERLY SWELL AND THE WIND INCREASING WITH THE SHIP ON DEAD LEE SHORE
2299-6525-0068 AND SOME STILL HELD PENNELL WAS GETTING UP STEAM AND HIS MEN STRUGGLING TO REPLACE THE ANCHORS WE GOT OUT THE MEN AND GAVE SOME HELP AT SIX STEAM WAS UP AND I WAS RIGHT GLAD TO SEE THE SHIP BACK OUT TO WINDWARD LEAVING US TO RECOVER ANCHORS AND HAWSERS
2299-6525-0069 SHE STOOD AWAY TO THE WEST AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER A LARGE BERG DROVE IN AND GROUNDED IN THE PLACE SHE HAD OCCUPIED WE SPENT THE DAY MEASURING OUR PROVISIONS AND FIXING UP CLOTHING ARRANGEMENTS FOR OUR JOURNEY A GOOD DEAL OF PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN THE AFTERNOON THE SHIP RETURNED TO THE NORTHERN ICE EDGE
2299-6525-0070 AND LOOSE ICE ALL ALONG THE EDGE OUR PEOPLE WENT OUT WITH THE ICE ANCHORS AND I SAW THE SHIP PASS WEST AGAIN THEN AS I WENT OUT ON THE FLOE CAME THE REPORT THAT SHE WAS ASHORE I RAN OUT TO THE CAPE WITH EVANS AND SAW THAT THE REPORT WAS ONLY TOO TRUE
2299-6525-0071 SHE LOOKED TO BE FIRMLY FIXED AND IN A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION IT LOOKED AS THOUGH SHE
2299-6525-0072 AS THE DRIFT WAS MAKING RAPIDLY TO THE SOUTH LATER PENNELL TOLD ME HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO LOOK BEHIND THE BERG AND HAD BEEN GOING ASTERN SOME TIME BEFORE HE STRUCK MY HEART SANK WHEN I LOOKED AT HER AND I SENT EVANS OFF IN THE WHALER TO SOUND
2299-6525-0073 RECOVERED THE ICE ANCHORS AGAIN SET THE PEOPLE TO WORK AND WALKED DISCONSOLATELY BACK TO THE CAPE TO WATCH VISIONS OF THE SHIP FAILING TO RETURN TO NEW ZEALAND AND OF SIXTY PEOPLE WAITING HERE AROSE IN MY MIND WITH SICKENING PERTINACITY
2299-6525-0074 AND THE ONLY CONSOLATION I COULD DRAW FROM SUCH IMAGINATIONS WAS THE DETERMINATION THAT THE SOUTHERN WORK SHOULD GO ON AS BEFORE MEANWHILE THE LEAST ILL POSSIBLE SEEMED TO BE AN EXTENSIVE LIGHTENING OF THE SHIP WITH BOATS
2299-6525-0075 AS THE TIDE WAS EVIDENTLY HIGH WHEN SHE STRUCK A TERRIBLY DEPRESSING PROSPECT
2299-6525-0076 THE MEN SHIFTING CARGO AFT PENNELL TELLS ME THEY SHIFTED TEN TONS IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE FIRST RAY OF HOPE CAME WHEN BY CAREFUL WATCHING ONE COULD SEE THAT THE SHIP WAS TURNING VERY SLOWLY THEN ONE SAW THE MEN RUNNING FROM SIDE TO SIDE
2299-6525-0077 AND KNEW THAT AN ATTEMPT WAS BEING MADE TO ROLL HER OFF THE ROLLING PRODUCED A MORE RAPID TURNING MOVEMENT AT FIRST AND THEN SHE SEEMED TO HANG AGAIN BUT ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME THE ENGINES HAD BEEN GOING ASTERN ALL THE TIME AND PRESENTLY A SLIGHT MOVEMENT BECAME APPARENT
2299-6525-0078 BUT WE ONLY KNEW SHE WAS GETTING CLEAR WHEN WE HEARD CHEERS ON BOARD AND MORE CHEERS FROM THE WHALER THEN SHE GATHERED STERN WAY AND WAS CLEAR THE RELIEF WAS ENORMOUS
2299-6525-0079 AND WORKED UNDER THESE VERY TRYING CIRCUMSTANCES FROM PENNELL DOWN THERE IS NOT AN OFFICER OR MAN WHO HAS NOT DONE HIS JOB NOBLY DURING THE PAST WEEKS AND IT WILL BE A GLORIOUS THING TO REMEMBER THE UNSELFISH LOYAL HELP THEY ARE GIVING US
2299-6525-0080 I THINK I LIKE HIM MORE EVERY DAY CAMPBELL AND HIS PARTY RETURNED LATE THIS AFTERNOON I HAVE NOT HEARD DETAILS MEARES AND OATES WENT TO THE GLACIER TONGUE AND SATISFIED THEMSELVES THAT THE ICE IS GOOD IT ONLY HAS TO REMAIN ANOTHER THREE DAYS
2299-6525-0081 AND IT WOULD BE POOR LUCK IF IT FAILED IN THAT TIME
2299-6525-0082 A QUIET DAY WITH LITTLE TO RECORD THE SHIP LIES PEACEFULLY IN THE BAY A BRISK NORTHERLY BREEZE IN THE FORENOON DIED TO LIGHT AIRS IN THE EVENING
2299-6525-0083 WE HAVE HAD A LONG BUSY DAY AT CLOTHING EVERYONE SEWING AWAY DILIGENTLY THE EASTERN PARTY PONIES WERE PUT ON BOARD THE SHIP THIS MORNING
2299-6525-0084 PLACID CONDITIONS LAST FOR A VERY SHORT TIME IN THESE REGIONS I GOT UP AT FIVE THIS MORNING TO FIND THE WEATHER CALM AND BEAUTIFUL BUT TO MY ASTONISHMENT AN OPENING LANE OF WATER BETWEEN THE LAND AND THE ICE IN THE BAY
2299-6525-0085 THE LATTER WAS GOING OUT IN A SOLID MASS THE SHIP DISCOVERED IT EASILY GOT UP HER ICE ANCHORS
2299-6525-0086 AND PUT OUT TO SEA TO DREDGE
2299-6525-0087 THIS PROVED AN EXAGGERATION BUT AN IMMENSE PIECE OF FLOE HAD SEPARATED FROM THE LAND MEARES AND I WALKED TILL WE CAME TO THE FIRST ICE LUCKILY WE FOUND THAT IT EXTENDS FOR SOME TWO MILES ALONG THE ROCK OF OUR CAPE AND WE DISCOVERED A POSSIBLE WAY TO LEAD PONIES DOWN TO IT
2299-6525-0088 IT WAS PLAIN THAT ONLY THE PONIES COULD GO BY IT NO LOADS
2299-6525-0089 WE HAVE GOT ALL THE FORAGE AND FOOD SLEDGES AND EQUIPMENT OFF TO THE SHIP THE DOGS WILL FOLLOW IN AN HOUR I HOPE
