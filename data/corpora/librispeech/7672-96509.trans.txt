7672-96509-0000 BUT THE THING WAS SO UTTERLY BEYOND THEIR WILDEST CONCEPTIONS SO TREMENDOUSLY DIFFERENT IN EVERY WAY IT LEFT THEM ALL A LITTLE UNWILLING TO COMMIT THEMSELVES
7672-96509-0001 WHAT GETS ME IS WHY THE HUMANS HAVE ALLOWED SUCH AN INFERNAL THING TO HAPPEN BILLIE SMILED SOMEWHAT SARDONICALLY I THOUGHT SHE REMARKED CUTTINGLY THAT YOU WERE
7672-96509-0002 ALWAYS IN SYMPATHY WITH THE UPPER DOG MISTER VAN EMMON I AM HOTLY THEN WITH THE MEMORY OF WHAT HE HAD JUST SEEN RUSHING BACK UPON HIM I MEAN I WAS
7672-96509-0003 UNTIL I SAW SAW THAT HE STOPPED FLUSHING DEEPLY AND BEFORE HE COULD COLLECT HIMSELF SMITH HAD BROKEN IN AGAIN I JUST HAPPENED TO REMEMBER DOC
7672-96509-0004 DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT THE VENUSIANS IN THOSE BOOKS OF YOURS SAY THAT SANUS IS RULED BY THE WORKERS JUST WHAT I WAS WONDERING ABOUT FROM VAN EMMON
7672-96509-0005 THE HUMANS SEEM TO DO ALL THE WORK AND THE BEES THE BOSSING THE DOCTOR EXPECTED THIS THE VENUSIANS HAD OUR VIEWPOINT
7672-96509-0006 THE VIEWPOINT OF PEOPLE ON THE EARTH WHEN THEY SAID THAT THE WORKERS RULE WE CONSIDER THE BEE AS A GREAT WORKER DON'T WE AS BUSY AS A BEE YOU KNOW NONE OF THE SO CALLED LOWER ANIMALS
7672-96509-0007 SHOW GREATER INDUSTRY YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY DEMANDED SMITH
7672-96509-0008 BEFORE THE DOCTOR COULD REPLY VAN EMMON BROKE IN IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HIS MIND REFUSED TO GET PAST THIS PARTICULAR POINT NOW
7672-96509-0009 SUPPOSE WE NOTE A THING OR TWO ABOUT CONDITIONS AS WE FIND THEM HERE ON THE EARTH WE THE HUMANS
7672-96509-0010 WHEN MAN RANKED NO HIGHER THAN OTHERS I FEEL SURE OF THIS HE INSISTED SEEING THAT SMITH WAS OPPOSED TO THE IDEA AND I THINK I KNOW JUST WHAT OCCURRED TO MAKE MAN SUPREME WHAT
7672-96509-0011 WELL MORE FAVORABLE TO THE BEES THE DOCTOR LOOKED AROUND THE CIRCLE WHAT DO YOU THINK A FACTOR MORE FAVORABLE TO THE BEES SHALL WE LET IT GO AT THAT THERE WAS NO REMARK
7672-96509-0012 EVEN FROM SMITH AND THE DOCTOR WENT AN COMING BACK TO THE BEES THEN WE NOTE THAT THEY ARE REMARKABLE FOR SEVERAL POINTS OF GREAT VALUE FIRST
7672-96509-0013 SECOND ALL BEES POSSESS WINGS AND ON THAT COUNT ALONE THEY ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO HUMANS THIRD AND TO ME THE MOST IMPORTANT THE BEES POSSESS A REMARKABLE COMBINATION
7672-96509-0014 OF COMMUNITY LIFE AND SPECIALIZATION OF COURSE WHEN YOU COME TO ANALYZE THESE TWO POINTS YOU SEE THAT THEY REALLY BELONG TO ONE ANOTHER
7672-96509-0015 IS NOT UNKNOWN TO CERTAIN FORMS OF EARTH'S INSECT LIFE I MEAN A SOLDIER TYPE A KIND OF BEE WHICH SPECIALIZES ON FIGHTING VAN EMMON WAS LISTENING CLOSELY
7672-96509-0016 YET HE HAD GOT ANOTHER IDEA PERHAPS THIS SOLDIER TYPE IS SIMPLY THE PLAIN WORKER BEE ALL GONE TO STING IT MAY BE THAT THESE BEES HAVE GIVEN UP LABOR ALTOGETHER STILL
7672-96509-0017 MUTTERED SMITH UNDER HIS BREATH ALL THIS DOESN'T SOLVE THE REAL PROBLEM WHY AREN'T THE HUMANS SUPREME FOR ONCE HE BECAME EMPHATIC THAT'S WHAT GETS
7672-96509-0018 ME WHY AREN'T THE HUMANS THE RULERS DOC KINNEY WAITED UNTIL HE FELT SURE THE OTHERS WERE DEPENDING UPON HIM SMITH
7672-96509-0019 YOU'LL ADMIT THAT SUCCESS BEGETS SUCCESS WON'T YOU SUCCESS BEGETS SUCCESS SURE NOTHING SUCCEEDS LIKE SUCCESS WELL ISN'T THAT MERELY ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF SUPERIORITY
7672-96509-0020 WILL LEAD TO FURTHER CONQUESTS WE HUMANS ARE THOROUGHLY CONSCIOUS OF OUR SUPREMACY IF WE WEREN'T WE'D NEVER ATTEMPT THE THINGS WE DO VAN EMMON SAW THE POINT IN OTHER WORDS
7672-96509-0021 THE HUMANS ON THE EARTH NEVER BEGAN TO SHOW THEIR SUPERIORITY UNTIL SOMETHING SOMETHING BIG HAPPENED TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR ABILITY EXACTLY CRIED KINNEY
7672-96509-0022 OUR PREHISTORIC ANCESTORS WOULD NEVER HAVE HANDED DOWN SUCH A TREMENDOUS AMBITION TO YOU AND ME IF THEY AT THAT TIME HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO POINT TO SOME DEFINITE FEAT AND SAY THAT PROVES
7672-96509-0023 I'M A BIGGER MAN THAN A HORSE FOR EXAMPLE OF COURSE REFLECTED BILLIE ALOUD OF COURSE THERE WERE OTHER FACTORS YES BUT THEY DON'T ALTER THE CASE
7672-96509-0024 ORIGINALLY THE HUMAN WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE APES HE ASSOCIATED WITH THERE WAS PERHAPS ONLY ONE SLIGHT POINT OF SUPERIORITY TODAY THERE ARE MILLIONS OF SUCH POINTS MAN IS
7672-96509-0025 INFINITELY SUPERIOR NOW AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE HE WAS SLIGHTLY SUPERIOR THEN SUPPOSE WE GRANT THAT REMARKED THE GEOLOGIST WHAT THEN
7672-96509-0026 DOES THAT EXPLAIN WHY THE BEES HAVE MADE GOOD ON SANUS TO A LARGE DEGREE
7672-96509-0027 WHICH ENABLED HIM TO FORCE HIS WILL UPON OTHER CREATURES THIS POWER WAS HIS POISONOUS STING HE FOUND THAT WHEN HE GOT HIS FELLOWS TOGETHER AND FORMED A SWARM
7672-96509-0028 THEY COULD ATTACK ANY ANIMAL IN SUCH LARGE NUMBERS AS TO MAKE IT HELPLESS ANY CREATURE YES EVEN REPTILES SCALES OR NO SCALES THEY'D ATTACK THE EYES
7672-96509-0029 THE DOCTOR THOUGHT FOR A FEW MINUTES LET'S SEE SUPPOSE WE ASSUME THAT A CERTAIN HUMAN ONCE HAPPENED TO BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF A HIVE
7672-96509-0030 ANTS ARE GREAT LOVERS OF HONEY YOU KNOW SUPPOSE THE MAN STEPPED AMONG THE ANTS AND WAS BITTEN NATURALLY HE WOULD TRAMPLE THEM TO DEATH AND SMASH WITH HIS HANDS ALL THAT HE COULDN'T TRAMPLE
7672-96509-0031 THAT THE BEES EVEN WHILE FIGHTING THE ANTS ALSO STARTED TO ATTACK THE MAN BUT THAT HE CHANCED TO TURN HIS ATTENTION TO THE ANTS FIRST SO THAT THE BEES LET HIM ALONE
7672-96509-0032 WE KNOW WHAT REMARKABLE THINGS BEES ARE WHEN IT COMES TO TELLING ONE ANOTHER WHAT THEY KNOW IS THERE ANY REASON WHY SUCH AN EXPERIENCE ALL NATURAL ENOUGH SHOULDN'T DEMONSTRATE TO THEM
7672-96509-0033 THEN AGREED THAT THE MAN ALSO MIGHT NOTICE THAT THE BEES FAILED TO STING HIM AS LONG AS HE CONTINUED TO DESTROY THEIR OTHER ENEMIES IF SO
7672-96509-0034 IT WAS QUITE CONCEIVABLE THAT BIT BY BIT THE BEES HAD FOUND OTHER AND MORE POSITIVE WAYS OF SECURING THE AID OF MEN THROUGH THREATENING TO STING EVEN TO CULTIVATING FLOWERS FOR THEIR BENEFIT
7672-96509-0035 SHE CONCEDED IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE SMITH HAD BEEN THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE I ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THAT A BEE'S STINGING APPARATUS IS GOOD FOR ONLY ONE ATTACK
7672-96509-0036 DOESN'T IT ALWAYS REMAIN BEHIND AFTER STINGING YES FROM THE DOCTOR QUIETLY THAT IS TRUE THE STING HAS TINY BARBS ON ITS TIP AND THESE CAUSE IT TO REMAIN IN THE WOUND
7672-96509-0037 THE STING IS ACTUALLY TORN AWAY FROM THE BEE WHEN IT FLIES AWAY IT NEVER GROWS ANOTHER THAT IS WHY IN FACT THE BEE NEVER STINGS EXCEPT AS A LAST RESORT
7672-96509-0038 QUESTION OF SELF DEFENSE JUST WHAT I THOUGHT CHUCKLED SMITH A BEE IS HELPLESS WITHOUT ITS STING IF SO HOW CAN YOU ACCOUNT FOR ANYTHING LIKE A SOLDIER BEE THE DOCTOR RETURNED HIS GAZE WITH
7672-96509-0039 PERFECT EQUANIMITY HE LOOKED AT VAN EMMON AND BILLIE THEY TOO SEEMED TO THINK THAT THE ENGINEER HAD FOUND A REAL FLAW IN KINNEY'S REASONING
7672-96509-0040 THE DOCTOR DROPPED HIS EYES AND SEARCHED HIS MIND THOROUGHLY FOR THE BEST WORDS HE REMOVED HIS BRACELETS WHILE HE WAS THINKING THE OTHERS DID THE SAME ALL FOUR GOT TO THEIR FEET AND STRETCHED
7672-96509-0041 SILENTLY BUT THOROUGHLY NOT UNTIL THEY WERE READY TO QUIT THE STUDY DID THE DOCTOR MAKE REPLY SMITH I DON'T NEED TO REMIND YOU THAT IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT IT'S
7672-96509-0042 TOO OLD A SAYING IN THIS CASE IT HAPPENS TO BE THE GREATEST TRUTH WE HAVE FOUND TODAY SMITH SPEAKING WITH THE UTMOST CARE WHAT WE HAVE JUST SAID ABOUT THE BEE'S STING IS ALL TRUE BUT
7672-96509-0043 IS THE SUPREME CREATURE ON ITS PLANET IT IS SUPERIOR TO ALL THE OTHER INSECTS ALL THE BIRDS ALL THE ANIMALS
7672-96509-0044 AND ITS SUPREMACY IS DUE SOLELY AND ENTIRELY TO THE FACT
