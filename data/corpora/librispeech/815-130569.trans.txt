815-130569-0000 THE PRINCE WHO ACQUIRED WISDOM THERE WAS ONCE A RAJA WHO HAD AN ONLY SON AND THE RAJA WAS ALWAYS URGING HIS SON TO LEARN TO READ AND WRITE IN ORDER THAT WHEN HE CAME TO HIS KINGDOM
815-130569-0001 HE MIGHT MANAGE WELL AND BE ABLE TO DECIDE DISPUTES THAT WERE BROUGHT TO HIM FOR JUDGMENT BUT THE BOY PAID NO HEED TO HIS FATHER'S ADVICE AND CONTINUED TO NEGLECT HIS LESSONS AT LAST WHEN HE WAS GROWN UP THE PRINCE SAW THAT HIS FATHER WAS RIGHT
815-130569-0002 AND HE RESOLVED TO GO AWAY TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO ACQUIRE WISDOM
815-130569-0003 AND HE TOOK WITH HIM A PURSE OF MONEY AND THREE PIECES OF GOLD AFTER TRAVELLING A LONG TIME HE ONE DAY SAW A MAN PLOUGHING IN A FIELD AND HE WENT AND GOT SOME TOBACCO FROM HIM
815-130569-0004 AND ASKED HIM WHETHER THERE WERE ANY WISE MEN LIVING IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH WISE MEN ASKED THE PLOUGHMAN THE PRINCE SAID THAT HE WAS TRAVELLING TO GET WISDOM THE PLOUGHMAN SAID THAT HE WOULD GIVE HIM INSTRUCTION IF HE WERE PAID
815-130569-0005 THEN THE PRINCE PROMISED TO GIVE HIM ONE GOLD PIECE FOR EACH PIECE OF WISDOM THE PLOUGHMAN AGREED AND SAID LISTEN ATTENTIVELY
815-130569-0006 YOU ARE THE SON OF A RAJA WHENEVER YOU GO TO VISIT A FRIEND OR ONE OF YOUR SUBJECTS AND THEY OFFER YOU A BEDSTEAD OR STOOL OR MAT TO SIT ON DO NOT SIT DOWN AT ONCE BUT MOVE THE STOOL OR MAT
815-130569-0007 A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE THIS IS ONE MAXIM GIVE ME MY GOLD COIN SO THE PRINCE PAID HIM THEN THE PLOUGHMAN SAID THE SECOND MAXIM IS THIS
815-130569-0008 WHENEVER YOU GO TO BATHE DO NOT BATHE AT THE COMMON BATHING PLACE BUT AT A PLACE BY YOURSELF GIVE ME MY COIN AND THE PRINCE DID SO THEN HE CONTINUED
815-130569-0009 MY THIRD MAXIM IS THIS YOU ARE THE SON OF A RAJA WHEN MEN COME TO YOU FOR ADVICE OR TO HAVE A DISPUTE DECIDED LISTEN TO WHAT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE PRESENT SAY
815-130569-0010 NOW PAY ME AND THE PRINCE GAVE HIM HIS LAST GOLD COIN AND SAID THAT HE HAD NO MORE WELL SAID THE PLOUGHMAN YOUR LESSON IS FINISHED BUT STILL I WILL GIVE YOU ONE MORE PIECE OF ADVICE FREE
815-130569-0011 AND IT IS THIS YOU ARE THE SON OF A RAJA RESTRAIN YOUR ANGER IF ANYTHING YOU SEE OR HEAR MAKES YOU ANGRY STILL DO NOT AT ONCE TAKE ACTION
815-130569-0012 HEAR THE EXPLANATION AND WEIGH IT WELL THEN IF YOU FIND CAUSE YOU CAN GIVE REIN TO YOUR ANGER AND IF NOT LET THE OFFENDER OFF AFTER THIS THE PRINCE SET HIS FACE HOMEWARDS AS HE HAD SPENT ALL HIS MONEY
815-130569-0013 AND HE BEGAN TO REPENT OF HAVING SPENT HIS GOLD PIECES ON ADVICE THAT SEEMED WORTHLESS HOWEVER ON HIS WAY HE TURNED INTO A BAZAR TO BUY SOME FOOD
815-130569-0014 HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO DO SO WHEN HE REMEMBERED THE MAXIM OF HIS INSTRUCTOR AND PULLED THE RUG TO ONE SIDE AND WHEN HE DID SO HE SAW THAT IT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER THE MOUTH OF A WELL AND THAT IF HE HAD SAT ON IT
815-130569-0015 THEN HE WENT ON HIS WAY AND ON THE ROAD HE TURNED ASIDE TO A TANK TO BATHE AND REMEMBERING THE MAXIM OF HIS TEACHER HE DID NOT BATHE AT THE COMMON PLACE BUT WENT TO A PLACE APART
815-130569-0016 THEN HAVING EATEN HIS LUNCH HE CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY BUT HE HAD NOT GONE FAR WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE HAD LEFT HIS PURSE BEHIND
815-130569-0017 THEREUPON HE APPLAUDED THE WISDOM OF HIS TEACHER FOR IF HE HAD BATHED AT THE COMMON BATHING PLACE SOMEONE WOULD HAVE SEEN THE PURSE AND HAVE TAKEN IT AWAY WHEN EVENING CAME ON HE TURNED INTO A VILLAGE AND ASKED THE HEADMAN
815-130569-0018 TO LET HIM SLEEP IN HIS VERANDAH AND THERE WAS ALREADY ONE OTHER TRAVELLER SLEEPING THERE AND IN THE MORNING IT WAS FOUND THAT THE TRAVELLER HAD DIED IN HIS SLEEP THEN THE HEADMAN CONSULTED THE VILLAGERS AND THEY DECIDED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE
815-130569-0019 BUT TO THROW AWAY THE BODY AND THAT AS THE PRINCE WAS ALSO A TRAVELLER HE SHOULD DO IT AT FIRST HE REFUSED TO TOUCH THE CORPSE AS HE WAS THE SON OF A RAJA BUT THE VILLAGERS INSISTED
815-130569-0020 AND THEN HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF THE MAXIM THAT HE SHOULD NOT ACT CONTRARY TO THE GENERAL OPINION SO HE YIELDED AND DRAGGED AWAY THE BODY AND THREW IT INTO A RAVINE
815-130569-0021 BEFORE LEAVING IT HE REMEMBERED THAT IT WAS PROPER TO REMOVE THE CLOTHES AND WHEN HE BEGAN TO DO SO HE FOUND ROUND THE WAIST OF THE BODY A ROLL OF COIN SO HE TOOK THIS AND WAS GLAD THAT HE HAD FOLLOWED THE ADVICE OF HIS TEACHER
815-130569-0022 THAT EVENING HE REACHED THE BOUNDARY OF HIS OWN TERRITORY AND DECIDED TO PRESS ON HOME ALTHOUGH IT WAS DARK AT MIDNIGHT HE REACHED THE PALACE AND WITHOUT AROUSING ANYONE WENT TO THE DOOR OF HIS WIFE'S ROOM
815-130569-0023 OUTSIDE THE DOOR HE SAW A PAIR OF SHOES AND A SWORD AT THE SIGHT HE BECAME WILD WITH RAGE AND DRAWING THE SWORD HE CALLED OUT WHO IS IN MY ROOM
815-130569-0024 AS A MATTER OF FACT THE PRINCE'S WIFE HAD GOT THE PRINCE'S LITTLE SISTER TO SLEEP WITH HER AND WHEN THE GIRL HEARD THE PRINCE'S VOICE SHE GOT UP TO LEAVE BUT WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND SAW THE PRINCE STANDING WITH THE DRAWN SWORD
815-130569-0025 SHE DREW BACK IN FEAR SHE TOLD HIM WHO SHE WAS AND EXPLAINED THAT THEY HAD PUT THE SHOES AND SWORD AT THE DOOR TO PREVENT ANYONE ELSE FROM ENTERING BUT IN HIS WRATH THE PRINCE WOULD NOT LISTEN AND CALLED TO HER TO COME OUT AND BE KILLED
