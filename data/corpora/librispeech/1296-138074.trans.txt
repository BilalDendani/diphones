1296-138074-0000 THAT MISSUS MUNT SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO DISCOVER THE MISFORTUNE WAS NOT REMARKABLE FOR SHE WAS SO INTERESTED IN THE FLATS THAT SHE WATCHED THEIR EVERY MUTATION WITH UNWEARYING CARE IN THEORY SHE DESPISED THEM
1296-138074-0001 THEY TOOK AWAY THAT OLD WORLD LOOK THEY CUT OFF THE SUN FLATS HOUSE A FLASHY TYPE OF PERSON BUT IF THE TRUTH HAD BEEN KNOWN SHE FOUND HER VISITS TO WICKHAM PLACE TWICE AS AMUSING SINCE WICKHAM MANSIONS HAD ARISEN
1296-138074-0002 AND WOULD IN A COUPLE OF DAYS LEARN MORE ABOUT THEM THAN HER NIECES IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS OR HER NEPHEW IN A COUPLE OF YEARS SHE WOULD STROLL ACROSS AND MAKE FRIENDS WITH THE PORTERS AND INQUIRE WHAT THE RENTS WERE
1296-138074-0003 EXCLAIMING FOR EXAMPLE WHAT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOR A BASEMENT YOU'LL NEVER GET IT AND THEY WOULD ANSWER ONE CAN BUT TRY MADAM THE PASSENGER LIFTS THE PROVISION LIFTS
1296-138074-0004 THE ARRANGEMENT FOR COALS A GREAT TEMPTATION FOR A DISHONEST PORTER WERE ALL FAMILIAR MATTERS TO HER AND PERHAPS A RELIEF FROM THE POLITICO ECONOMICAL AESTHETIC ATMOSPHERE THAT REIGNED AT THE SCHLEGELS
1296-138074-0005 MARGARET RECEIVED THE INFORMATION CALMLY AND DID NOT AGREE THAT IT WOULD THROW A CLOUD OVER POOR HELEN'S LIFE OH BUT HELEN ISN'T A GIRL WITH NO INTERESTS SHE EXPLAINED SHE HAS PLENTY OF OTHER THINGS AND OTHER PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT
1296-138074-0006 SHE MADE A FALSE START WITH THE WILCOXES AND SHE'LL BE AS WILLING AS WE ARE TO HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH THEM FOR A CLEVER GIRL DEAR HOW VERY ODDLY YOU DO TALK
1296-138074-0007 HELEN'LL HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO DO WITH THEM NOW THAT THEY'RE ALL OPPOSITE SHE MAY MEET THAT PAUL IN THE STREET SHE CANNOT VERY WELL NOT BOW OF COURSE SHE MUST BOW BUT LOOK HERE LET'S DO THE FLOWERS
1296-138074-0008 I WAS GOING TO SAY THE WILL TO BE INTERESTED IN HIM HAS DIED AND WHAT ELSE MATTERS I LOOK ON THAT DISASTROUS EPISODE OVER WHICH YOU WERE SO KIND AS THE KILLING OF A NERVE IN HELEN
1296-138074-0009 IT'S DEAD AND SHE'LL NEVER BE TROUBLED WITH IT AGAIN THE ONLY THINGS THAT MATTER ARE THE THINGS THAT INTEREST ONE BOWING EVEN CALLING AND LEAVING CARDS EVEN A DINNER PARTY WE CAN DO ALL THOSE THINGS TO THE WILCOXES
1296-138074-0010 IF THEY FIND IT AGREEABLE BUT THE OTHER THING THE ONE IMPORTANT THING NEVER AGAIN DON'T YOU SEE MISSUS MUNT DID NOT SEE AND INDEED MARGARET WAS MAKING A MOST QUESTIONABLE STATEMENT
1296-138074-0011 THAT ANY EMOTION ANY INTEREST ONCE VIVIDLY AROUSED CAN WHOLLY DIE I ALSO HAVE THE HONOUR TO INFORM YOU THAT THE WILCOXES ARE BORED WITH US I DIDN'T TELL YOU AT THE TIME
1296-138074-0012 IT MIGHT HAVE MADE YOU ANGRY AND YOU HAD ENOUGH TO WORRY YOU BUT I WROTE A LETTER TO MISSUS W AND APOLOGIZED FOR THE TROUBLE THAT HELEN HAD GIVEN THEM SHE DIDN'T ANSWER IT HOW VERY RUDE I WONDER OR WAS IT SENSIBLE
1296-138074-0013 NO MARGARET MOST RUDE IN EITHER CASE ONE CAN CLASS IT AS REASSURING MISSUS MUNT SIGHED SHE WAS GOING BACK TO SWANAGE ON THE MORROW JUST AS HER NIECES WERE WANTING HER MOST
1296-138074-0014 OTHER REGRETS CROWDED UPON HER FOR INSTANCE HOW MAGNIFICENTLY SHE WOULD HAVE CUT CHARLES IF SHE HAD MET HIM FACE TO FACE SHE HAD ALREADY SEEN HIM GIVING AN ORDER TO THE PORTER
1296-138074-0015 AND VERY COMMON HE LOOKED IN A TALL HAT BUT UNFORTUNATELY HIS BACK WAS TURNED TO HER AND THOUGH SHE HAD CUT HIS BACK SHE COULD NOT REGARD THIS AS A TELLING SNUB BUT YOU WILL BE CAREFUL WON'T YOU SHE EXHORTED
1296-138074-0016 OH CERTAINLY FIENDISHLY CAREFUL AND HELEN MUST BE CAREFUL TOO CAREFUL OVER WHAT CRIED HELEN AT THAT MOMENT COMING INTO THE ROOM WITH HER COUSIN NOTHING SAID MARGARET SEIZED WITH A MOMENTARY AWKWARDNESS
1296-138074-0017 CAREFUL OVER WHAT AUNT JULEY MISSUS MUNT ASSUMED A CRYPTIC AIR IT IS ONLY THAT A CERTAIN FAMILY WHOM WE KNOW BY NAME BUT DO NOT MENTION AS YOU SAID YOURSELF LAST NIGHT AFTER THE CONCERT
1296-138074-0018 HAVE TAKEN THE FLAT OPPOSITE FROM THE MATHESONS WHERE THE PLANTS ARE IN THE BALCONY HELEN BEGAN SOME LAUGHING REPLY AND THEN DISCONCERTED THEM ALL BY BLUSHING MISSUS MUNT WAS SO DISCONCERTED THAT SHE EXCLAIMED
1296-138074-0019 WHAT HELEN YOU DON'T MIND THEM COMING DO YOU AND DEEPENED THE BLUSH TO CRIMSON OF COURSE I DON'T MIND SAID HELEN A LITTLE CROSSLY IT IS THAT YOU AND MEG ARE BOTH SO ABSURDLY GRAVE ABOUT IT WHEN THERE'S NOTHING TO BE GRAVE ABOUT AT ALL
1296-138074-0020 I'M NOT GRAVE PROTESTED MARGARET A LITTLE CROSS IN HER TURN WELL YOU LOOK GRAVE DOESN'T SHE FRIEDA I DON'T FEEL GRAVE THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY YOU'RE GOING QUITE ON THE WRONG TACK
1296-138074-0021 NO SHE DOES NOT FEEL GRAVE ECHOED MISSUS MUNT I CAN BEAR WITNESS TO THAT SHE DISAGREES HARK INTERRUPTED FRAULEIN MOSEBACH I HEAR BRUNO ENTERING THE HALL
1296-138074-0022 HE WAS NOT ENTERING THE HALL IN FACT HE DID NOT ENTER IT FOR QUITE FIVE MINUTES BUT FRIEDA DETECTED A DELICATE SITUATION AND SAID THAT SHE AND HELEN HAD MUCH BETTER WAIT FOR BRUNO DOWN BELOW
1296-138074-0023 AND LEAVE MARGARET AND MISSUS MUNT TO FINISH ARRANGING THE FLOWERS HELEN ACQUIESCED BUT AS IF TO PROVE THAT THE SITUATION WAS NOT DELICATE REALLY SHE STOPPED IN THE DOORWAY AND SAID DID YOU SAY THE MATHESONS FLAT AUNT JULEY
1296-138074-0024 HOW WONDERFUL YOU ARE I NEVER KNEW THAT THE WOMAN WHO LACED TOO TIGHTLY'S NAME WAS MATHESON COME HELEN SAID HER COUSIN GO HELEN SAID HER AUNT AND CONTINUED TO MARGARET ALMOST IN THE SAME BREATH
1296-138074-0025 HELEN CANNOT DECEIVE ME SHE DOES MIND OH HUSH BREATHED MARGARET FRIEDA'LL HEAR YOU AND SHE CAN BE SO TIRESOME SHE MINDS PERSISTED MISSUS MUNT
1296-138074-0026 MOVING THOUGHTFULLY ABOUT THE ROOM AND PULLING THE DEAD CHRYSANTHEMUMS OUT OF THE VASES I KNEW SHE'D MIND AND I'M SURE A GIRL OUGHT TO SUCH AN EXPERIENCE SUCH AWFUL COARSE GRAINED PEOPLE
1296-138074-0027 I KNOW MORE ABOUT THEM THAN YOU DO WHICH YOU FORGET AND IF CHARLES HAD TAKEN YOU THAT MOTOR DRIVE WELL YOU'D HAVE REACHED THE HOUSE A PERFECT WRECK OH MARGARET YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE IN FOR
1296-138074-0028 THEY'RE ALL BOTTLED UP AGAINST THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOW THERE'S MISSUS WILCOX I'VE SEEN HER THERE'S PAUL THERE'S EVIE WHO IS A MINX THERE'S CHARLES I SAW HIM TO START WITH
1296-138074-0029 AND WHO WOULD AN ELDERLY MAN WITH A MOUSTACHE AND A COPPER COLOURED FACE BE MISTER WILCOX POSSIBLY I KNEW IT AND THERE'S MISTER WILCOX
1296-138074-0030 COMPLAINED MARGARET HE HAS A REMARKABLY GOOD COMPLEXION FOR A MAN OF HIS AGE MISSUS MUNT TRIUMPHANT ELSEWHERE COULD AFFORD TO CONCEDE MISTER WILCOX HIS COMPLEXION
1296-138074-0031 SHE PASSED ON FROM IT TO THE PLAN OF CAMPAIGN THAT HER NIECES SHOULD PURSUE IN THE FUTURE MARGARET TRIED TO STOP HER HELEN DID NOT TAKE THE NEWS QUITE AS I EXPECTED BUT THE WILCOX NERVE IS DEAD IN HER REALLY
1296-138074-0032 SO THERE'S NO NEED FOR PLANS IT'S AS WELL TO BE PREPARED NO IT'S AS WELL NOT TO BE PREPARED
1296-138074-0033 BECAUSE HER THOUGHT DREW BEING FROM THE OBSCURE BORDERLAND SHE COULD NOT EXPLAIN IN SO MANY WORDS BUT SHE FELT THAT THOSE WHO PREPARE FOR ALL THE EMERGENCIES OF LIFE BEFOREHAND MAY EQUIP THEMSELVES AT THE EXPENSE OF JOY
1296-138074-0034 IT IS NECESSARY TO PREPARE FOR AN EXAMINATION OR A DINNER PARTY OR A POSSIBLE FALL IN THE PRICE OF STOCK THOSE WHO ATTEMPT HUMAN RELATIONS MUST ADOPT ANOTHER METHOD OR FAIL
1296-138074-0035 BECAUSE I'D SOONER RISK IT WAS HER LAME CONCLUSION BUT IMAGINE THE EVENINGS EXCLAIMED HER AUNT POINTING TO THE MANSIONS WITH THE SPOUT OF THE WATERING CAN
1296-138074-0036 AND IT'S ALMOST THE SAME ROOM ONE EVENING THEY MAY FORGET TO DRAW THEIR BLINDS DOWN AND YOU'LL SEE THEM AND THE NEXT YOU YOURS AND THEY'LL SEE YOU IMPOSSIBLE TO SIT OUT ON THE BALCONIES
1296-138074-0037 IMPOSSIBLE TO WATER THE PLANTS OR EVEN SPEAK IMAGINE GOING OUT OF THE FRONT DOOR AND THEY COME OUT OPPOSITE AT THE SAME MOMENT AND YET YOU TELL ME THAT PLANS ARE UNNECESSARY AND YOU'D RATHER RISK IT I HOPE TO RISK THINGS ALL MY LIFE
1296-138074-0038 OH MARGARET MOST DANGEROUS BUT AFTER ALL SHE CONTINUED WITH A SMILE THERE'S NEVER ANY GREAT RISK AS LONG AS YOU HAVE MONEY OH SHAME WHAT A SHOCKING SPEECH MONEY PADS THE EDGES OF THINGS SAID MISS SCHLEGEL
1296-138074-0039 GOD HELP THOSE WHO HAVE NONE BUT THIS IS SOMETHING QUITE NEW SAID MISSUS MUNT WHO COLLECTED NEW IDEAS AS A SQUIRREL COLLECTS NUTS AND WAS ESPECIALLY ATTRACTED BY THOSE THAT ARE PORTABLE
1296-138074-0040 NEW FOR ME SENSIBLE PEOPLE HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED IT FOR YEARS YOU AND I AND THE WILCOXES STAND UPON MONEY AS UPON ISLANDS IT IS SO FIRM BENEATH OUR FEET THAT WE FORGET ITS VERY EXISTENCE
1296-138074-0041 IT'S ONLY WHEN WE SEE SOMEONE NEAR US TOTTERING THAT WE REALIZE ALL THAT AN INDEPENDENT INCOME MEANS LAST NIGHT WHEN WE WERE TALKING UP HERE ROUND THE FIRE I BEGAN TO THINK THAT THE VERY SOUL OF THE WORLD IS ECONOMIC
1296-138074-0042 AND THAT THE LOWEST ABYSS IS NOT THE ABSENCE OF LOVE BUT THE ABSENCE OF COIN I CALL THAT RATHER CYNICAL
1296-138074-0043 THAT'S MORE LIKE SOCIALISM SAID MISSUS MUNT SUSPICIOUSLY CALL IT WHAT YOU LIKE I CALL IT GOING THROUGH LIFE WITH ONE'S HAND SPREAD OPEN ON THE TABLE I'M TIRED OF THESE RICH PEOPLE WHO PRETEND TO BE POOR
1296-138074-0044 AND THINK IT SHOWS A NICE MIND TO IGNORE THE PILES OF MONEY THAT KEEP THEIR FEET ABOVE THE WAVES I STAND EACH YEAR UPON SIX HUNDRED POUNDS AND HELEN UPON THE SAME AND TIBBY WILL STAND UPON EIGHT
1296-138074-0045 AND AS FAST AS OUR POUNDS CRUMBLE AWAY INTO THE SEA THEY ARE RENEWED FROM THE SEA YES FROM THE SEA AND ALL OUR THOUGHTS ARE THE THOUGHTS OF SIX HUNDRED POUNDERS AND ALL OUR SPEECHES
1296-138074-0046 AND BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO STEAL UMBRELLAS OURSELVES WE FORGET THAT BELOW THE SEA PEOPLE DO WANT TO STEAL THEM AND DO STEAL THEM SOMETIMES AND THAT WHAT'S A JOKE UP HERE IS DOWN THERE REALITY
1296-138074-0047 REALLY FOR A GERMAN SHE DOES DRESS CHARMINGLY OH WHAT IS IT HELEN WAS LOOKING UP AT THE WILCOXES FLAT WHY SHOULDN'T SHE I BEG YOUR PARDON I INTERRUPTED YOU WHAT WAS IT YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT REALITY
1296-138074-0048 I HAD WORKED ROUND TO MYSELF AS USUAL ANSWERED MARGARET IN TONES THAT WERE SUDDENLY PREOCCUPIED DO TELL ME THIS AT ALL EVENTS ARE YOU FOR THE RICH OR FOR THE POOR TOO DIFFICULT ASK ME ANOTHER
1296-138074-0049 FOR RICHES HURRAH FOR RICHES FOR RICHES ECHOED MISSUS MUNT HAVING AS IT WERE AT LAST SECURED HER NUT YES FOR RICHES MONEY FOR EVER SO AM I AND SO I AM AFRAID ARE MOST OF MY ACQUAINTANCES AT SWANAGE
1296-138074-0050 WELL WOULD YOU BE VERY KIND WOULD YOU COME ROUND WITH ME TO THE REGISTRY OFFICE THERE'S A HOUSEMAID WHO WON'T SAY YES BUT DOESN'T SAY NO ON THEIR WAY THITHER THEY TOO LOOKED UP AT THE WILCOXES FLAT
1296-138074-0051 EVIE WAS IN THE BALCONY STARING MOST RUDELY ACCORDING TO MISSUS MUNT OH YES IT WAS A NUISANCE THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF IT HELEN WAS PROOF AGAINST A PASSING ENCOUNTER BUT MARGARET BEGAN TO LOSE CONFIDENCE
1296-138074-0052 MIGHT IT REAWAKE THE DYING NERVE IF THE FAMILY WERE LIVING CLOSE AGAINST HER EYES AND FRIEDA MOSEBACH WAS STOPPING WITH THEM FOR ANOTHER FORTNIGHT AND FRIEDA WAS SHARP ABOMINABLY SHARP AND QUITE CAPABLE OF REMARKING
1296-138074-0053 YOU LOVE ONE OF THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN OPPOSITE YES THE REMARK WOULD BE UNTRUE BUT OF THE KIND WHICH IF STATED OFTEN ENOUGH MAY BECOME TRUE JUST AS THE REMARK ENGLAND AND GERMANY ARE BOUND TO FIGHT
1296-138074-0054 RENDERS WAR A LITTLE MORE LIKELY EACH TIME THAT IT IS MADE AND IS THEREFORE MADE THE MORE READILY BY THE GUTTER PRESS OF EITHER NATION HAVE THE PRIVATE EMOTIONS ALSO THEIR GUTTER PRESS MARGARET THOUGHT SO
1296-138074-0055 THEY MIGHT BY CONTINUAL CHATTER LEAD HELEN INTO A REPETITION OF THE DESIRES OF JUNE INTO A REPETITION THEY COULD NOT DO MORE THEY COULD NOT LEAD HER INTO LASTING LOVE
1296-138074-0056 THEY WERE SHE SAW IT CLEARLY JOURNALISM HER FATHER WITH ALL HIS DEFECTS AND WRONG HEADEDNESS HAD BEEN LITERATURE AND HAD HE LIVED HE WOULD HAVE PERSUADED HIS DAUGHTER RIGHTLY THE REGISTRY OFFICE WAS HOLDING ITS MORNING RECEPTION
1296-138074-0057 A STRING OF CARRIAGES FILLED THE STREET MISS SCHLEGEL WAITED HER TURN AND FINALLY HAD TO BE CONTENT WITH AN INSIDIOUS TEMPORARY BEING REJECTED BY GENUINE HOUSEMAIDS ON THE GROUND OF HER NUMEROUS STAIRS
1296-138074-0058 HER FAILURE DEPRESSED HER AND THOUGH SHE FORGOT THE FAILURE THE DEPRESSION REMAINED ON HER WAY HOME SHE AGAIN GLANCED UP AT THE WILCOXES FLAT AND TOOK THE RATHER MATRONLY STEP OF SPEAKING ABOUT THE MATTER TO HELEN
1296-138074-0059 HELEN YOU MUST TELL ME WHETHER THIS THING WORRIES YOU IF WHAT SAID HELEN WHO WAS WASHING HER HANDS FOR LUNCH
1296-138074-0060 NO OF COURSE NOT REALLY REALLY THEN SHE ADMITTED THAT SHE WAS A LITTLE WORRIED ON MISSUS WILCOX'S ACCOUNT SHE IMPLIED THAT MISSUS WILCOX MIGHT REACH BACKWARD INTO DEEP FEELINGS
1296-138074-0061 AND BE PAINED BY THINGS THAT NEVER TOUCHED THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THAT CLAN I SHAN'T MIND IF PAUL POINTS AT OUR HOUSE AND SAYS THERE LIVES THE GIRL WHO TRIED TO CATCH ME BUT SHE MIGHT
1296-138074-0062 IF EVEN THAT WORRIES YOU WE COULD ARRANGE SOMETHING THERE'S NO REASON WE SHOULD BE NEAR PEOPLE WHO DISPLEASE US OR WHOM WE DISPLEASE THANKS TO OUR MONEY WE MIGHT EVEN GO AWAY FOR A LITTLE WELL I AM GOING AWAY
1296-138074-0063 I THOUGHT I MINDED NOTHING BUT REALLY I I SHOULD BE BORED IF YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH THE SAME MAN TWICE AND SHE CLEARED HER THROAT YOU DID GO RED YOU KNOW WHEN AUNT JULEY ATTACKED YOU THIS MORNING I SHOULDN'T HAVE REFERRED TO IT OTHERWISE
1296-138074-0064 BUT HELEN'S LAUGH RANG TRUE AS SHE RAISED A SOAPY HAND TO HEAVEN
1296-138074-0065 WOULD SHE AGAIN FALL IN LOVE WITH ANY OF THE WILCOX FAMILY
