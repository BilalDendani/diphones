7835-97730-0000 THE COLD RAIN BEAT ON HIS FACE AND HE SAW THE FIGURES OF THE SENTINELS MOVING BACK AND FORTH BUT BLACK AGAINST THE BLACK WALL HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT HE COULD NOT BE SEEN BY THEM HALF WAY TO THE WINDOW HIS EYES NOW HAVING GOTTEN USED TO THE DARKNESS
7835-97730-0001 HE CONTINUED HIS SEARCH FOLLOWING THE REVEALING FOOT PRINTS HE WENT NEARLY ALL THE WAY AROUND THE HOUSE AND THEN LOST THEM AMONG HEAVY SHRUBBERY
7835-97730-0002 HAD LEFT THE PLACE PASSING BETWEEN THE SENTINELS IN THE RAINY DARK
7835-97730-0003 BUT HARRY WHILE KEEPING HIS OWN COUNSEL HELD ANOTHER OPINION AND HE WAS EQUALLY POSITIVE ABOUT IT
7835-97730-0004 HE LOOKED BACK AND RECOGNIZED SHERBURNE THE YOUNG CAPTAIN WAS HOLDING HIMSELF ERECT IN THE SADDLE BUT HIS HORSE AND HIS UNIFORM WERE COVERED WITH RED MUD
7835-97730-0005 SURE THAT HIS MISSION WAS IMPORTANT HARRY WENT TO HIM AT ONCE IS GENERAL JACKSON INSIDE ASKED SHERBURNE
7835-97730-0006 REPLIED HARRY LOOKING AT THE LIGHTED WINDOWS THEN ASK HIM IF I CAN SEE HIM AT ONCE
7835-97730-0007 SHERBURNE SLIPPED FROM HIS HORSE HARRY NOTICED THAT IT WAS NOT HIS USUAL ELASTIC SPRING HE SEEMED ALMOST TO FALL TO THE GROUND AND THE HORSE NO HAND ON THE REINS STILL STOOD MOTIONLESS HIS HEAD DROOPING
7835-97730-0008 AND NOW THAT HE CAME NEARER HIS FACE SHOWED GREAT ANXIETY AS WELL AS WEARINESS
7835-97730-0009 THEN HE HELPED HIM OFF WITH HIS WET AND MUDDY OVERCOAT PUSHED HIM INTO A CHAIR AND SAID I'LL ANNOUNCE YOU TO GENERAL JACKSON AND HE'LL SEE YOU AT ONCE HARRY KNEW THAT JACKSON WOULD NOT LINGER A SECOND WHEN A MESSENGER OF IMPORTANCE CAME
7835-97730-0010 AND HE WENT INTO THE LIBRARY WHERE THE MINISTER AND THE GENERAL STOOD TALKING GENERAL JACKSON HELD IN ONE HAND A LARGE LEATHER COVERED VOLUME AND WITH THE FOREFINGER OF THE OTHER HAND HE WAS POINTING TO A PARAGRAPH IN IT THE MINISTER WAS SAYING SOMETHING THAT HARRY DID NOT CATCH
7835-97730-0011 WHAT FORCE DO YOU THINK BANKS HAS
7835-97730-0012 A GOOD GUESS THE FIGURES OF MY SPIES SAY THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND AND WE CAN MUSTER SCARCELY FIVE THOUSAND HERE WE MUST MOVE JACKSON SPOKE WITHOUT EMOTION HIS WORDS WERE COLD AND DRY EVEN FORMAL
7835-97730-0013 BUT IT WAS KINSHIP NEVERTHELESS AND THEY HAD MADE THE MOST OF IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER FOR HIM WERE STRANGERS INSTEAD OF FRIENDS TO SEE THEIR RETREAT
7835-97730-0014 IT IS OBVIOUS THAT YOU NEED REST SAID JACKSON MISTER KENTON YOU WILL WAIT AND TAKE THE ORDERS THAT I AM GOING TO WRITE
7835-97730-0015 JACKSON TURNED TO A SHELF OF THE LIBRARY ON WHICH LAY PEN INK AND PAPER AND STANDING BEFORE IT RAPIDLY WROTE SEVERAL NOTES IT WAS HIS FAVORITE ATTITUDE HABIT OF HIS WEST POINT DAYS TO WRITE OR READ STANDING
7835-97730-0016 IT TOOK HIM LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES TO WRITE THE NOTES AND HE HANDED THEM TO HARRY TO DELIVER WITHOUT DELAY TO THE BRIGADE COMMANDERS HIS TONES WERE INCISIVE AND CHARGED WITH ENERGY HARRY FELT THE ELECTRIC THRILL PASS TO HIMSELF AND WITH A QUICK SALUTE HE WAS ONCE MORE OUT IN THE RAIN
7835-97730-0017 SOME OF THE BRIGADIERS WERE ASLEEP AND GRUMBLED WHEN HARRY AWOKE THEM BUT THE ORDERS SOON SENT THE LAST REMNANTS OF SLEEP FLYING THE
7835-97730-0018 BOY DID NOT LINGER BUT RETURNED QUICKLY TO THE MANSE WHERE GENERAL JACKSON MET HIM AT THE DOOR OTHER AIDES WERE COMING OR GOING BUT ALL SAVE ONE OR TWO WINDOWS OF THE HOUSE WERE DARK NOW AND THE MERRYMAKING WAS OVER YOU HAVE DELIVERED THE ORDERS ASKED JACKSON YES SIR ALL OF THEM
7835-97730-0019 HARRY ALSO TOLD THEN OF THE FACE THAT HE HAD SEEN AT THE WINDOW AND HIS BELIEF CONCERNING ITS IDENTITY VERY LIKELY SAID JACKSON BUT WE CANNOT PURSUE HIM NOW NOW GO TO HEADQUARTERS AND SLEEP BUT I SHALL WANT YOU AT DAWN
7835-97730-0020 THE MONTH THEY HAD SPENT AT WINCHESTER AFTER THE GREAT RAID HAD BEEN DEVOTED MOSTLY TO DRILL THE DAY OF DEPARTURE CAME AND THE ARMY AMID THE GOOD WISHES OF MANY FRIENDS IN WINCHESTER FILED OUT OF THE TOWN THE GREAT RAINS WHICH IT HAD SEEMED WOULD NEVER CEASE HAD CEASED AT LAST
7835-97730-0021 DURING ALL THE DAYS OF PREPARATION JACKSON HAD SAID NOTHING ABOUT HIS PLAN OF RETREAT THE VIRGINIANS LINING THE STREETS AND WATCHING SO ANXIOUSLY DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE WOULD SEEK REFUGE AND SUDDENLY AS THEY WATCHED A CHEER TREMENDOUS AND INVOLUNTARY BURST FROM THEM
7835-97730-0022 BUT THE BURST OF ELATION WAS SHORT EVEN THE CIVILIANS IN WINCHESTER KNEW THAT JACKSON WAS HUGELY OUTNUMBERED HARRY HIMSELF WAS ASTONISHED AND HE GAZED AT HIS LEADER WHAT FATHOMLESS PURPOSE LAY BENEATH THAT STERN BEARDED FACE JACKSON'S EYES EXPRESSED NOTHING
7835-97730-0023 HE AND HE ALONE KNEW WHAT WAS IN HIS MIND BUT THE TROOPS ASKED NO WORD FROM THEIR LEADERS THE FACT THAT THEIR FACES WERE TURNED TOWARD THE NORTH WAS ENOUGH FOR THEM THEY KNEW TOO OF THE HEAVY ODDS THAT WERE AGAINST THEM
7835-97730-0024 AS HARRY WATCHED THE YOUNG SOLDIERS MANY OF WHOM SANG AS THEY MARCHED HIS OWN ENTHUSIASM ROSE
7835-97730-0025 THERE WERE FEW GLIMPSES OF COLOR IN THE COLUMNS BUT THE MEN MARCHED WITH A STRONG ELASTIC STEP THEY HAD ALL BEEN BORN UPON THE FARMS OR IN THE LITTLE VILLAGES AND THEY WERE FAMILIAR WITH THE HILLS AND FORESTS
7835-97730-0026 THESE UNIFORMS HAD BEEN SPUN FOR THEM AND MADE FOR THEM BY THEIR OWN MOTHERS AND WIVES AND SISTERS OR SWEETHEARTS THEY WERE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE GRAY BUT THERE WERE MANY SHADES OF GRAY SOMETIMES VERGING TO A LIGHT BLUE WITH BUTTERNUT AS THE PREDOMINANT COLOR
7835-97730-0027 THEY WORE GRAY JACKETS SHORT OF WAIST AND SINGLE BREASTED CAPS WERE GIVING WAY TO SOFT FELT HATS AND BOOTS HAD ALREADY BEEN SUPPLANTED BY BROAD STRONG SHOES CALLED BROGANS MANY OF THE SOLDIERS CARRIED FRYING PANS AND SKILLETS HUNG ON THE BARRELS OF THEIR RIFLES
7835-97730-0028 SIMPLE KITCHEN UTENSILS WHICH CONSTITUTED ALMOST THE WHOLE OF THEIR COOKING EQUIPMENT THEIR BLANKETS AND RUBBER SHEETS FOR SLEEPING WERE CARRIED IN LIGHT ROLLS ON THEIR BACKS A TOOTHBRUSH WAS STUCK IN A BUTTONHOLE
7835-97730-0029 ON THEIR FLANKS OR IN FRONT RODE THE CAVALRY LED BY THE REDOUBTABLE TURNER ASHBY AND THERE WAS IN ALL THEIR NUMBER SCARCELY A SINGLE HORSEMAN WHO DID NOT RIDE LIKE THE COMANCHE INDIAN AS IF HE WERE BORN IN THE SADDLE
7835-97730-0030 ASHBY WAS A HOST IN HIMSELF HE HAD OFTEN RIDDEN AS MUCH AS EIGHTY MILES A DAY TO INSPECT HIS OWN PICKETS
7835-97730-0031 THE NORTHERN CAVALRY UNUSED TO THE SADDLE COMPARED VERY BADLY WITH THOSE OF THE SOUTH IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE WAR ASHBY'S MEN MOREOVER RODE OVER COUNTRY THAT THEY HAD KNOWN ALL THEIR LIVES THERE WAS NO FOREST FOOTPATH NO TRAIN AMONG THE HILLS HIDDEN FROM THEM
7835-97730-0032 BUT THE CANNON OF JACKSON'S ARMY WAS INFERIOR HERE THE MECHANICAL GENIUS OF THE NORTH SHOWED SUPREME SUCH WAS THE LITTLE ARMY OF JACKSON SOMBER TO SEE WHICH MARCHED FORTH UPON A CAMPAIGN UNRIVALLED IN THE HISTORY OF WAR
7835-97730-0033 THE MEN WHOM THEY WERE TO MEET WERE OF STAUNCH STOCK AND SPIRIT THEMSELVES BANKS THEIR COMMANDER HAD WORKED IN HIS YOUTH AS A COMMON LABORER IN A COTTON MILL AND HAD FORCED HIMSELF UP BY VIGOR AND ENERGY BUT SHIELDS WAS A VETERAN OF THE MEXICAN WAR
7835-97730-0034 HARRY'S DUTIES CARRIED HIM BACK AND FORTH WITH THE MARCHING COLUMNS BUT HE LINGERED LONGEST BESIDE THE INVINCIBLES ONLY A REGIMENT NOW AND THAT REGIMENT COMPOSED ALMOST WHOLLY OF VIRGINIANS SAINT CLAIR WAS STILL IN THE SMARTEST OF UNIFORMS A CONTRAST TO THE OTHERS
7835-97730-0035 AND AS HE NODDED TO HARRY HE TOLD HIM THAT THE TROOPS EXPECTED TO MEET THE ENEMY BEFORE NIGHT I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY GOT THAT BELIEF
7835-97730-0036 SAID LANGDON BUT IT MIGHT BE WORSE THAN THAT IT MIGHT BE A HUNDRED TO ONE IT'S HARDLY AS BAD AS TEN TO ONE TOM SAID HARRY WITH A LAUGH
7835-97730-0037 AND THEY KNOW IT'S ALL RIGHT THEN SAID LANGDON SQUARING HIS SHOULDERS AND LOOKING FEROCIOUS TEN TO ONE WOULD BE A LITTLE ROUGH ON US
7835-97730-0038 IS IT SO HARRY I SUPPOSE SO
7835-97730-0039 HARRY RODE ON SALUTING COLONEL TALBOT AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL
7835-97730-0040 THE FIRST FLUSH OF GREEN WAS OVER EVERYTHING THE SNOWS WERE GONE THE RAINS THAT FOLLOWED WERE GONE TOO AND THE EARTH WAS DRYING RAPIDLY UNDER THE MILD WINDS THAT BLEW FROM THE MOUNTAINS IT WAS EVIDENT TO ALL
7835-97730-0041 THE DAY WAS FILLED WITH EXCITEMENT FOR HARRY THE GREAT FEDERAL ARMY WAS NOW SO NEAR THAT THE RIVAL PICKETS WERE ALMOST CONSTANTLY IN TOUCH
7835-97730-0042 NIGHT CAME AND THE SOUTHERN ARMY STOPPED FOR SUPPER AND REST
7835-97730-0043 YET THE MEN ATE CALMLY AND LAY DOWN UNDER THE TREES JACKSON CALLED A COUNCIL IN A LITTLE GROVE GENERAL GARNETT THE COMMANDER OF THE STONEWALL BRIGADE ALL THE COLONELS OF THE REGIMENTS
7835-97730-0044 A LITTLE FIRE OF FALLEN WOOD LIGHTED UP THE ANXIOUS AND EARNEST FACES JACKSON SPOKE RAPIDLY HARRY HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN HIM SHOW SO MUCH EMOTION AND OUTWARD FIRE
7835-97730-0045 BUT THE OTHER OFFICERS SHOOK THEIR HEADS SADLY THERE HAD BEEN A CONFUSION OF ORDERS THEIR OWN TROOPS HAD BEEN SCATTERED AND THEIR SUPPLY TRAINS WERE FAR AWAY IF THEY ATTACKED THEY WOULD SURELY FALL JACKSON RELUCTANTLY GAVE UP HIS PLAN AND WALKED GLOOMILY AWAY
7835-97730-0046 BUT HE TURNED PRESENTLY AND BECKONED TO HARRY AND OTHERS OF HIS STAFF HIS EYES WERE SHINING SOME STRANGE MOOD SEEMED TO POSSESS HIM MOUNT AT ONCE GENTLEMEN HE SAID AND RIDE WITH ME I'M GOING TO WINCHESTER
7835-97730-0047 ONE OR TWO OF THE OFFICERS OPENED THEIR MOUTHS TO PROTEST BUT CHECKED THE WORDS WHEN THEY SAW JACKSON'S STERN FACE
7835-97730-0048 IT SEEMED THAT SOMETHING THE GENERAL HAD SAID TO THE MINISTER THE DAY BEFORE TROUBLED HIM
7835-97730-0049 HARRY WAS NOT AT ALL SURPRISED IN FACT AS HE CAME TO KNOW HIM THOROUGHLY HE WAS NEVER SURPRISED AT ANYTHING THIS STRANGE MAN AND GENIUS DID
7835-97730-0050 HARRY'S SURMISE WAS RIGHT JACKSON WAS TORN WITH EMOTION AT BEING COMPELLED TO ABANDON WINCHESTER AND HE WANTED TO EXPLAIN HOW IT WAS TO THE FRIEND WHOM HE LIKED SO WELL
7835-97730-0051 LOOKING THE MINISTER STEADILY IN THE FACE BUT NOT SEEING HIM
7835-97730-0052 I WILL
7835-97730-0053 YET CARRY OUT THIS PLAN I WILL THINK IT MUST BE DONE THE MINISTER SAID NOTHING STANDING AND STARING AT THE GENERAL LIKE ONE FASCINATED
7835-97730-0054 HE HAD NEVER SEEN JACKSON THAT WAY BEFORE HIS FACE WAS LINED WITH THOUGHT AND HIS EYES BURNED LIKE COALS OF FIRE HIS HAND FIERCELY CLINCHED THE HILT OF HIS SWORD HE WHO SHOWED EMOTION SO RARELY WAS OVERCOME BY IT NOW
7835-97730-0055 NO NO HE SAID SADLY
7835-97730-0056 MEANTIME THE NORTH WAS URGING MC CLELLAN WITH HIS MIGHTY ARMY TO ADVANCE ON RICHMOND
7835-97730-0057 THERE WAS FULL WARRANT FOR THE BELIEF OF MC CLELLAN
7835-97730-0058 WHAT COULD A FEW THOUSAND MEN NO MATTER HOW BRAVE AND HARDY DO AGAINST AN ARMY AS LARGE AS THAT OF BANKS
7835-97730-0059 THESE DARING HORSEMEN SKIRMISHED CONTINUALLY WITH THE ENEMY AND HARRY AS HE PASSED BACK AND FORTH WITH ORDERS SAW MUCH OF IT
7835-97730-0060 COLONEL SAID HARRY TO COLONEL TALBOT
7835-97730-0061 SHALL WE EVER MAKE HEADWAY AGAINST SUCH A FORCE OR SHALL WE BE COMPELLED TO RETREAT UNTIL WE MAKE A JUNCTION WITH THE MAIN ARMY UNDER GENERAL JOHNSTON COLONEL TALBOT GLANCED BACK AT THE PUFFS OF WHITE SMOKE
7835-97730-0062 NO HARRY I DON'T BELIEVE WE'LL KEEP ON RETREATING HE REPLIED I WAS WITH GENERAL TAYLOR WHEN HE FELL BACK BEFORE THE MEXICAN FORCES UNDER SANTA ANNA WHICH OUTNUMBERED HIM FIVE TO ONE
7835-97730-0063 THE YANKEES ARE NOT MEXICANS FAR FROM IT THEY ARE AS BRAVE AS ANYBODY BUT STONEWALL JACKSON IS A FAR GREATER GENERAL THAN ZACHARY TAYLOR I'M HOPING FOR THE BEST SAID HARRY WE'LL ALL WAIT AND SEE SAID THE COLONEL
7835-97730-0064 HARRY FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT THEY WOULD FALL BACK NO MORE AND HIS SPIRITS BEGAN TO RISE AGAIN BUT THE FACTS UPON WHICH HIS HOPES WERE BASED WERE SMALL JACKSON HAD LESS THAN FIVE THOUSAND MEN AND IN THE NORTH HE WAS WIPED OFF THE MAP
7835-97730-0065 IT WAS NO LONGER NECESSARY FOR CABINET MEMBERS AND GENERALS TO TAKE HIM INTO CONSIDERATION JACKSON NOW OUT OF THE WAY THE MAIN PORTION OF THE ARMY UNDER BANKS WAS DIRECTED TO MARCH EASTWARD TO MANASSAS
7835-97730-0066 WHILE A HEAVY DETACHMENT STILL MORE THAN DOUBLE JACKSON'S IN NUMBERS REMAINED IN THE VALLEY MEANWHILE MC CLELLAN WITH HIS RIGHT FLANK CLEAR WAS GOING BY SEA TO RICHMOND GOADED TO ACTION AT LAST BY THE INCESSANT DEMANDS OF A PEOPLE
7835-97730-0067 HARRY WAS WITH STONEWALL JACKSON WHEN THE NEWS OF THESE MOVEMENTS REACHED THEM
7835-97730-0068 GENERAL BANKS IS MOVING EASTWARD TO COVER THE EASTERN APPROACHES TO WASHINGTON SAID THE YOUNG CAPTAIN WHILE GENERAL SHIELDS WITH TWELVE THOUSAND MEN IS BETWEEN US AND WINCHESTER SO SAID JACKSON SHERBURNE LOOKED AT HIM EARNESTLY BUT HE GAVE NO SIGN
7835-97730-0069 RIDE BACK TO YOUR CHIEF AND TELL HIM I THANK HIM FOR HIS VIGILANCE AND TO REPORT TO ME PROMPTLY EVERYTHING THAT HE MAY DISCOVER SAID JACKSON
7835-97730-0070 AND RETURN TO ME IN AN HOUR WITH SUCH NEWS AS YOU MAY HAVE HARRY WENT GLADLY SOMETIMES HE LONGED TO BE AT THE FRONT WITH TURNER ASHBY THERE WHERE THE RIFLES WERE OFTEN CRACKLING WHAT WILL HE DO WILL HE TURN NOW
7835-97730-0071 NOBODY KNOWS HIS PLANS BUT I THINK HE'LL ATTACK I FEEL QUITE SURE OF IT CAPTAIN THEY CAME SOON TO A FIELD IN WHICH TURNER ASHBY WAS SITTING ON A HORSE EXAMINING POINTS FURTHER DOWN THE VALLEY WITH A PAIR OF POWERFUL GLASSES
7835-97730-0072 SHERBURNE REPORTED BRIEFLY AND ASHBY NODDED BUT DID NOT TAKE THE GLASSES FROM HIS EYES
7835-97730-0073 DESPITE HIS YOUTH AND THE ARDOR OF BATTLE IN HIS NOSTRILS HARRY FELT THE TRAGEDY OF WAR IN THIS PLEASANT COUNTRY IT WAS A NOBLE LANDSCAPE THAT OF THE VALLEY BETWEEN THE BLUE MOUNTAINS BEFORE HIM STRETCHED LOW HILLS COVERED HERE AND THERE WITH FINE GROUPS OF OAK OR PINE WITHOUT UNDERGROWTH
7835-97730-0074 HOUSES OF RED BRICK WITH PORTICOES AND GREEN SHUTTERS STOOD IN WIDE GROUNDS
7835-97730-0075 AND ON THE WEST A LOW HILL WITH A SMALL GROVE GROWING ON THE CREST DOMINATING THE WHOLE WERE THE LOFTY CLIFFS OF NORTH MOUNTAIN ON THE WEST THE MAIN FORCE OF THE NORTH STRENGTHENED WITH CANNON LAY TO THE EAST OF THE TURNPIKE
7835-97730-0076 SHIELDS A VETERAN OF THE MEXICAN WAR HIMSELF WAS NOT PRESENT AT THIS MOMENT BUT KIMBALL COMMANDING IN HIS ABSENCE WAS ALERT AND DID NOT SHARE THE GENERAL BELIEF THAT STONEWALL JACKSON MIGHT BE CONSIDERED NON EXISTENT HARRY
7835-97730-0077 THINGS COMING INTO BETTER VIEW THE LONGER HE LOOKED SAW MUCH OF THE UNION POSITION AND TURNER ASHBY PRESENTLY HANDED HIM THE GLASSES THEN HE PLAINLY DISCERNED THE GUNS AND A GREAT MASS OF INFANTRY WITH THE COLORS WAVING ABOVE THEM IN THE GENTLE BREEZE
7835-97730-0078 SAID TURNER ASHBY DRYLY
7835-97730-0079 THE BEARDED SILENT MAN SHOWED NO EXCITEMENT
7835-97730-0080 THE CAVALRY LED BY ASHBY BEGAN TO PRESS THE ENEMY HARD IN FRONT OF A LITTLE VILLAGE CALLED KERNSTOWN A REGIMENT WITH TWO GUNS LED THE ADVANCE ON THE WEST OF THE TURNPIKE AND THE HEAVIER MASS OF INFANTRY MARCHED ACROSS THE FIELDS ON THE LEFT HARRY AS HIS DUTY BADE HIM
7835-97730-0081 KEPT BESIDE HIS GENERAL WHO WAS RIDING NEAR THE HEAD OF THE INFANTRY
7835-97730-0082 THERE WAS AN END TO RETREATS THEY SAW THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE EAGER TO RUSH UPON HIM THE PULSES IN HARRY'S TEMPLES WERE BEATING HARD HE ALREADY CONSIDERED HIMSELF A VETERAN OF BATTLE BUT HE COULD NOT SEE IT NEAR WITHOUT FEELING EXCITEMENT
7835-97730-0083 THE TWO BATTERIES ON THE HILL HAD OPENED AT A RANGE OF A MILE ON JACKSON'S INFANTRY THOSE MEN OF THE NORTH WERE GOOD GUNNERS AND HARRY HEARD THE SHELLS AND SOLID SHOT SCREAMING AND HISSING AROUND
7835-97730-0084 FROM THE EAST AND FROM A POINT NEAR A CHURCH CALLED THE OPEQUON CAME THE THUNDER OF THEIR OWN GUNS ADVANCING UP THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TURNPIKE NOW THE GREAT MARCHING QUALITIES OF JACKSON'S MEN WERE SHOWN NOT IN VAIN HAD THEY LEARNED TO BE FOOT CAVALRY
7835-97730-0085 BEFORE THEM STRETCHED THE RIDGE AND HARRY WAS IN FEAR LEST THE ENEMY SPRING FORWARD AND SEIZE IT FIRST BUT NO FOE APPEARED IN FRONT OF THEM IN THE FIELDS AND THEN WITH A RUSH THEY WERE AT THE FOOT OF THE RIDGE ANOTHER RUSH AND THEY HAD CLIMBED IT
