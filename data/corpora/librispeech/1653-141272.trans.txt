1653-141272-0000 MANY CAMPAIGNS WERE FOUGHT FOR THE CONTEST WAS CONTINUED THROUGH SEVERAL SUCCESSIVE YEARS THE KING OF SWEDEN MADE REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO DESTROY THE NEW CITY OF SAINT PETERSBURG BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS ON THE CONTRARY THE TOWN GREW AND PROSPERED MORE AND MORE
1653-141272-0001 AND THE SHELTER AND PROTECTION WHICH THE FORTIFICATIONS AROUND IT AFFORDED TO THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER AND TO THE ADJACENT ROADSTEADS ENABLED THE CZAR TO GO ON SO RAPIDLY IN BUILDING NEW SHIPS AND IN THUS INCREASING AND STRENGTHENING HIS FLEET
1653-141272-0002 THAT VERY SOON HE WAS MUCH STRONGER THAN THE KING OF SWEDEN IN ALL THE NEIGHBORING WATERS SO THAT HE NOT ONLY WAS ABLE TO KEEP THE ENEMY VERY EFFECTUALLY AT BAY BUT HE EVEN MADE SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL DESCENTS UPON THE SWEDISH TERRITORY ALONG THE ADJOINING COASTS
1653-141272-0003 BUT WHILE THE CZAR WAS THUS RAPIDLY INCREASING HIS POWER AT SEA THE KING OF SWEDEN PROVED HIMSELF THE STRONGEST ON LAND HE EXTENDED HIS CONQUESTS VERY RAPIDLY IN POLAND AND IN THE ADJOINING PROVINCES AND AT LAST IN THE SUMMER OF SEVENTEEN O EIGHT
1653-141272-0004 WHICH WAS STILL PETER'S CAPITAL HE ACCORDINGLY PUSHED HIS FORCES FORWARD UNTIL HE APPROACHED THE BANK OF THE RIVER HE CAME UP TO IT AT A CERTAIN POINT AS IF HE WAS INTENDING TO CROSS THERE
1653-141272-0005 PETER ASSEMBLED ALL HIS TROOPS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER AT THAT POINT IN ORDER TO OPPOSE HIM BUT THE DEMONSTRATION WHICH THE KING MADE OF AN INTENTION TO CROSS AT THAT POINT WAS ONLY A PRETENSE HE LEFT A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF MEN THERE TO MAKE A SHOW
1653-141272-0006 AND SECRETLY MARCHED AWAY THE GREAT BODY OF HIS TROOPS IN THE NIGHT TO A POINT ABOUT THREE MILES FARTHER UP THE RIVER WHERE HE SUCCEEDED IN CROSSING WITH THEM BEFORE THE EMPEROR'S FORCES HAD ANY SUSPICION OF HIS REAL DESIGN
1653-141272-0007 THE RUSSIANS WHO WERE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO OPPOSE HIM IN THE OPEN FIELD WERE OBLIGED IMMEDIATELY TO RETREAT AND LEAVE HIM IN FULL POSSESSION OF THE GROUND PETER WAS NOW MUCH ALARMED HE SENT AN OFFICER TO THE CAMP OF THE KING OF SWEDEN WITH A FLAG OF TRUCE TO
1653-141272-0008 ASK ON WHAT TERMS THE KING WOULD MAKE PEACE WITH HIM BUT CHARLES WAS TOO MUCH ELATED WITH HIS SUCCESS IN CROSSING THE RIVER AND PLACING HIMSELF IN A POSITION FROM WHICH HE COULD ADVANCE WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING ANY FARTHER OBSTRUCTION
1653-141272-0009 TO THE VERY GATES OF THE CAPITAL TO BE WILLING THEN TO PROPOSE ANY TERMS SO HE DECLINED ENTERING INTO ANY NEGOTIATION SAYING ONLY IN A HAUGHTY TONE THAT HE WOULD TREAT WITH HIS BROTHER PETER AT MOSCOW ON MATURE REFLECTION HOWEVER
1653-141272-0010 HE SEEMS TO HAVE CONCLUDED THAT IT WOULD BE MORE PRUDENT FOR HIM NOT TO MARCH AT ONCE TO MOSCOW AND SO HE TURNED HIS COURSE FOR A TIME TOWARD THE SOUTHWARD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CRIMEA AND THE BLACK SEA
1653-141272-0011 THERE WAS ONE SECRET REASON WHICH INDUCED THE KING OF SWEDEN TO MOVE THUS TO THE SOUTHWARD WHICH PETER DID NOT FOR A TIME UNDERSTAND THE COUNTRY OF THE COSSACKS LAY IN THAT DIRECTION AND THE FAMOUS MAZEPPA
1653-141272-0012 OF WHOM SOME ACCOUNT HAS ALREADY BEEN GIVEN IN THIS VOLUME WAS THE CHIEFTAIN OF THE COSSACKS AND HE AS IT HAPPENED
1653-141272-0013 AND HAD AGREED THAT IF THE KING WOULD COME INTO HIS PART OF THE COUNTRY HE WOULD DESERT THE CAUSE OF THE CZAR AND WOULD COME OVER TO HIS SIDE WITH ALL THE COSSACKS UNDER HIS COMMAND THE CAUSE OF MAZEPPA'S QUARREL WITH THE CZAR WAS THIS HE WAS ONE DAY PAYING A VISIT TO HIS MAJESTY
1653-141272-0014 AND WHILE SEATED AT TABLE PETER BEGAN TO COMPLAIN OF THE LAWLESS AND UNGOVERNABLE CHARACTER OF THE COSSACKS AND TO PROPOSE THAT MAZEPPA SHOULD INTRODUCE CERTAIN REFORMS IN THE ORGANIZATION AND DISCIPLINE OF THE TRIBE WITH A VIEW OF BRINGING THEM UNDER MORE EFFECTUAL CONTROL
1653-141272-0015 IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE REFORMS WHICH HE PROPOSED WERE SOMEWHAT ANALOGOUS TO THOSE WHICH HE HAD INTRODUCED SO SUCCESSFULLY INTO THE ARMIES UNDER HIS OWN MORE IMMEDIATE COMMAND MAZEPPA OPPOSED THIS SUGGESTION
1653-141272-0016 HE SAID THAT THE ATTEMPT TO ADOPT SUCH MEASURES WITH THE COSSACKS WOULD NEVER SUCCEED THAT THE MEN WERE SO WILD AND SAVAGE BY NATURE AND SO FIXED IN THE RUDE AND IRREGULAR HABITS OF WARFARE TO WHICH THEY AND THEIR FATHERS HAD BEEN SO LONG ACCUSTOMED
1653-141272-0017 AND AS WAS USUAL WITH HIM IN SUCH CASES HE BROKE OUT IN THE MOST RUDE AND VIOLENT LANGUAGE IMAGINABLE HE CALLED MAZEPPA AN ENEMY AND A TRAITOR AND THREATENED TO HAVE HIM IMPALED ALIVE IT IS TRUE HE DID NOT REALLY MEAN WHAT HE SAID
1653-141272-0018 HIS WORDS BEING ONLY EMPTY THREATS DICTATED BY THE BRUTAL VIOLENCE OF HIS ANGER STILL MAZEPPA WAS VERY MUCH OFFENDED HE WENT AWAY FROM THE CZAR'S TENT MUTTERING HIS DISPLEASURE AND RESOLVING SECRETLY ON REVENGE
1653-141272-0019 SOON AFTER THIS MAZEPPA OPENED THE COMMUNICATION ABOVE REFERRED TO WITH THE KING OF SWEDEN AND AT LAST AN AGREEMENT WAS MADE BETWEEN THEM BY WHICH IT WAS STIPULATED THAT THE KING WAS TO ADVANCE INTO THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY WHERE OF COURSE THE COSSACKS WOULD BE SENT OUT TO MEET HIM
1653-141272-0020 AND THEN MAZEPPA WAS TO REVOLT FROM THE CZAR AND GO OVER WITH ALL HIS FORCES TO THE KING OF SWEDEN'S SIDE BY THIS MEANS THE CZAR'S ARMY WAS SURE THEY THOUGHT TO BE DEFEATED AND IN THIS CASE THE KING OF SWEDEN WAS TO REMAIN IN POSSESSION OF THE RUSSIAN TERRITORY
1653-141272-0021 WHILE THE COSSACKS WERE TO RETIRE TO THEIR OWN FORTRESSES AND LIVE THENCEFORTH AS AN INDEPENDENT TRIBE THE PLOT SEEMED TO BE VERY WELL LAID BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE CONTRIVERS OF IT IT WAS NOT DESTINED TO SUCCEED IN THE FIRST PLACE
1653-141272-0022 AND ALMOST ENTIRELY DEFEATED BEFORE THE TIME ARRIVED FOR PUTTING IT INTO EXECUTION PETER HAD HIS SECRET AGENTS EVERY WHERE AND THROUGH THEM HE RECEIVED SUCH INFORMATION IN RESPECT TO MAZEPPA'S MOVEMENTS AS LED HIM TO SUSPECT HIS DESIGNS
1653-141272-0023 HE SAID NOTHING HOWEVER BUT MANOEUVRED HIS FORCES SO AS TO HAVE A LARGE BODY OF TROOPS THAT HE COULD RELY UPON ALWAYS NEAR MAZEPPA AND THE COSSACKS AND BETWEEN THEM AND THE ARMY OF THE SWEDES HE ORDERED THE OFFICERS OF THESE TROOPS TO WATCH MAZEPPA'S MOVEMENTS CLOSELY
1653-141272-0024 AND TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST HIM AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE SHOULD OCCASION REQUIRE
1653-141272-0025 FOR THE TROOPS THUS STATIONED NEAR HIM SEEMED TO BE PLACED THERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CO OPERATING WITH HIM AGAINST THE ENEMY IN THE MEAN TIME MAZEPPA CAUTIOUSLY MADE KNOWN HIS PLANS TO THE LEADING MEN AMONG THE COSSACKS AS FAST AS HE THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO DO SO
1653-141272-0026 HE REPRESENTED TO THEM HOW MUCH BETTER IT WOULD BE FOR THEM TO BE RESTORED TO THEIR FORMER LIBERTY AS AN INDEPENDENT TRIBE
1653-141272-0027 HE ALSO ENUMERATED THE VARIOUS GRIEVANCES WHICH THEY SUFFERED UNDER RUSSIAN RULE AND ENDEAVORED TO EXCITE THE ANIMOSITY OF HIS HEARERS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AGAINST PETER'S GOVERNMENT
1653-141272-0028 HE FOUND THAT THE CHIEF OFFICERS OF THE COSSACKS SEEMED QUITE DISPOSED TO LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID AND TO ADOPT HIS VIEWS SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY SO AND OTHERS PRETENDED TO BE SO FOR FEAR OF DISPLEASING HIM
1653-141272-0029 AT LENGTH HE THOUGHT IT TIME TO TAKE SOME MEASURES FOR PREPARING THE MINDS OF THE MEN GENERALLY FOR WHAT WAS TO COME AND IN ORDER TO DO THIS HE DETERMINED ON PUBLICLY SENDING A MESSENGER TO THE CZAR WITH THE COMPLAINTS WHICH HE HAD TO MAKE IN BEHALF OF HIS MEN THE MEN
1653-141272-0030 KNOWING OF THIS EMBASSY AND UNDERSTANDING THE GROUNDS OF THE COMPLAINT WHICH MAZEPPA WAS TO MAKE BY MEANS OF IT WOULD BE PLACED HE THOUGHT IN SUCH A POSITION THAT IN THE EVENT OF AN UNFAVORABLE ANSWER BEING RETURNED AS HE HAD NO DOUBT WOULD BE THE CASE THEY COULD BE THE MORE EASILY LED INTO THE REVOLT WHICH HE PROPOSED
1653-141272-0031 MAZEPPA ACCORDINGLY MADE OUT A STATEMENT OF HIS COMPLAINTS AND APPOINTED HIS NEPHEW A COMMISSIONER TO PROCEED TO HEAD QUARTERS AND LAY THEM BEFORE THE CZAR THE NAME OF THE NEPHEW WAS WARNAROWSKI AS SOON AS WARNAROWSKI ARRIVED AT THE CAMP
1653-141272-0032 PETER INSTEAD OF GRANTING HIM AN AUDIENCE AND LISTENING TO THE STATEMENT WHICH HE HAD TO MAKE ORDERED HIM TO BE SEIZED AND SENT TO PRISON AS IF HE WERE GUILTY OF A SPECIES OF TREASON IN COMING TO TROUBLE HIS SOVEREIGN WITH COMPLAINTS AND DIFFICULTIES AT SUCH A TIME
1653-141272-0033 WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS SUFFERING UNDER AN ACTUAL INVASION FROM A FOREIGN ENEMY AS SOON AS MAZEPPA HEARD THAT HIS NEPHEW WAS ARRESTED HE WAS CONVINCED THAT HIS PLOTS HAD BEEN DISCOVERED AND THAT HE MUST NOT LOSE A MOMENT IN CARRYING THEM INTO EXECUTION
1653-141272-0034 OR ALL WOULD BE LOST HE ACCORDINGLY IMMEDIATELY PUT HIS WHOLE FORCE IN MOTION TO MARCH TOWARD THE PLACE WHERE THE SWEDISH ARMY WAS THEN POSTED OSTENSIBLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ATTACKING THEM
1653-141272-0035 HE CROSSED A CERTAIN RIVER WHICH LAY BETWEEN HIM AND THE SWEDES AND THEN WHEN SAFELY OVER HE STATED TO HIS MEN WHAT HE INTENDED TO DO THE MEN WERE FILLED WITH INDIGNATION AT THIS PROPOSAL WHICH BEING WHOLLY UNEXPECTED CAME UPON THEM BY SURPRISE
1653-141272-0036 THEY REFUSED TO JOIN IN THE REVOLT A SCENE OF GREAT EXCITEMENT AND CONFUSION FOLLOWED A PORTION OF THE COSSACKS THOSE WITH WHOM MAZEPPA HAD COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING BEFOREHAND WERE DISPOSED TO GO WITH HIM BUT THE REST WERE FILLED WITH VEXATION AND RAGE
1653-141272-0037 INDEED IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THE TWO FACTIONS WOULD HAVE COME SOON TO A BLOODY FIGHT FOR THE POSSESSION OF THE PERSON OF THEIR CHIEFTAIN IN WHICH CASE HE WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE BEEN TORN TO PIECES IN THE STRUGGLE
1653-141272-0038 IF THOSE WHO WERE DISPOSED TO REVOLT HAD NOT FLED BEFORE THE OPPOSITION TO THEIR MOVEMENT HAD TIME TO BECOME ORGANIZED MAZEPPA AND THOSE WHO ADHERED TO HIM ABOUT TWO THOUSAND MEN IN ALL WENT OVER IN A BODY TO THE CAMP OF THE SWEDES
1653-141272-0039 MARCHED AT ONCE TO THE NEAREST BODY OF RUSSIAN FORCES AND PUT THEMSELVES UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE RUSSIAN GENERAL THERE A COUNCIL OF WAR WAS SOON AFTER CALLED IN THE RUSSIAN CAMP FOR THE PURPOSE OF BRINGING MAZEPPA TO TRIAL HE WAS OF COURSE FOUND GUILTY AND SENTENCE OF DEATH
1653-141272-0040 WITH A GREAT MANY INDIGNITIES TO ACCOMPANY THE EXECUTION WAS PASSED UPON HIM THE SENTENCE HOWEVER COULD NOT BE EXECUTED UPON MAZEPPA HIMSELF FOR HE WAS OUT OF THE REACH OF HIS ACCUSERS BEING SAFE IN THE SWEDISH CAMP SO THEY MADE A WOODEN IMAGE OR EFFIGY TO REPRESENT HIM
1653-141272-0041 AND INFLICTED THE PENALTIES UPON THE SUBSTITUTE INSTEAD IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY DRESSED THE EFFIGY TO IMITATE THE APPEARANCE OF MAZEPPA AND PUT UPON IT REPRESENTATIONS OF THE MEDALS RIBBONS AND OTHER DECORATIONS WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO WEAR
1653-141272-0042 THEY BROUGHT THIS FIGURE OUT BEFORE THE CAMP IN PRESENCE OF THE GENERAL AND OF ALL THE LEADING OFFICERS THE SOLDIERS BEING ALSO DRAWN UP AROUND THE SPOT A HERALD APPEARED AND READ THE SENTENCE OF CONDEMNATION AND THEN PROCEEDED TO CARRY IT INTO EXECUTION AS FOLLOWS
