474-141425-0000 THERE'S ONE THING THIS HOUSE BOAT NEEDS WROTE HOMER IN THE COMPLAINT BOOK THAT ADORNED THE CENTRE TABLE IN THE READING ROOM AND THAT IS A POETS CORNER THERE ARE SMOKING ROOMS FOR THOSE WHO SMOKE BILLIARD ROOMS FOR THOSE WHO PLAY BILLIARDS AND A CARD ROOM FOR THOSE WHO PLAY CARDS
474-141425-0001 I DO NOT SMOKE I CAN'T PLAY BILLIARDS AND I DO NOT KNOW A TREY OF DIAMONDS FROM A SILVER SALVER ALL I CAN DO IS WRITE POETRY WHY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ME BY ALL MEANS LET US HAVE A POETS CORNER WHERE A MAN CAN BE INSPIRED IN PEACE
474-141425-0002 FOR FOUR DAYS THIS ENTRY LAY IN THE BOOK APPARENTLY UNNOTICED
474-141425-0003 AND IT RELUCTANTLY TOOK THE SUBJECT IN HAND AT AN EARLY MEETING I FIND HERE SAID DEMOSTHENES TO THE CHAIRMAN AS THE COMMITTEE GATHERED A SUGGESTION FROM HOMER AND SAMSON THAT THIS HOUSE BOAT BE PROVIDED WITH A POETS CORNER
474-141425-0004 I DO NOT KNOW THAT I APPROVE OF THE SUGGESTION MYSELF BUT IN ORDER TO BRING IT BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR DEBATE I AM WILLING TO MAKE A MOTION THAT THE REQUEST BE GRANTED EXCUSE ME PUT IN DOCTOR JOHNSON
474-141425-0005 HERE IS NOT VERY DEFINITE WHERE IS HERE IN THE COMPLAINT BOOK WHICH I HOLD IN MY HAND RETURNED DEMOSTHENES PUTTING A PEBBLE IN HIS MOUTH SO THAT HE MIGHT ENUNCIATE MORE CLEARLY A FROWN RUFFLED THE SERENITY OF DOCTOR JOHNSON'S BROW
474-141425-0006 I THOUGHT HOUSE COMMITTEES WERE NOT EXPECTED TO PAY ANY ATTENTION TO COMPLAINTS IN COMPLAINT BOOKS I NEVER HEARD OF ITS BEING DONE BEFORE WELL I CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE EITHER REPLIED DEMOSTHENES CHEWING THOUGHTFULLY ON THE PEBBLE
474-141425-0007 BUT I SUPPOSE COMPLAINT BOOKS ARE THE PLACES FOR COMPLAINTS YOU DON'T EXPECT PEOPLE TO WRITE SERIAL STORIES OR DIALECT POEMS IN THEM DO YOU THAT ISN'T THE POINT AS THE MAN SAID TO THE ASSASSIN WHO TRIED TO STAB HIM WITH THE HILT OF HIS DAGGER
474-141425-0008 RETORTED DOCTOR JOHNSON WITH SOME ASPERITY OF COURSE COMPLAINT BOOKS ARE FOR THE RECEPTION OF COMPLAINTS NOBODY DISPUTES THAT
474-141425-0009 I FANCY WE HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT TO TAKE THE MATTER UP SAID BLACKSTONE WEARILY THOUGH I DON'T KNOW OF ANY PRECEDENT FOR SUCH ACTION
474-141425-0010 IN ALL THE CLUBS I HAVE KNOWN THE HOUSE COMMITTEES HAVE INVARIABLY TAKEN THE GROUND THAT THE COMPLAINT BOOK WAS ESTABLISHED TO GUARD THEM AGAINST THE ANNOYANCE OF HEARING COMPLAINTS THIS ONE HOWEVER HAS BEEN FORCED UPON US BY OUR SECRETARY
474-141425-0011 AND IN VIEW OF THE AGE OF THE COMPLAINANTS I THINK WE CANNOT WELL DECLINE TO GIVE THEM A SPECIFIC ANSWER RESPECT FOR AGE IS DE RIGUEUR AT ALL TIMES LIKE CLEAN HANDS I'LL SECOND THE MOTION
474-141425-0012 I THINK THE POETS CORNER ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY SAID CONFUCIUS THIS ISN'T A CLASS ORGANIZATION AND WE SHOULD RESIST ANY EFFORT TO MAKE IT OR ANY PORTION OF IT SO
474-141425-0013 WE OUGHT TO DISCOURAGE RATHER THAN ENCOURAGE THESE POETS THEY ARE ALWAYS LITTERING THE CLUB UP WITH THEMSELVES ONLY LAST WEDNESDAY I CAME HERE WITH A GUEST NO LESS A PERSON THAN A RECENTLY DECEASED EMPEROR OF CHINA
474-141425-0014 AND WHAT WAS THE FIRST SIGHT THAT GREETED OUR EYES I GIVE IT UP SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON IT MUST HAVE BEEN A CATACORNERED SIGHT WHATEVER IT WAS IF THE EMPEROR'S EYES SLANTED LIKE YOURS
474-141425-0015 NO PERSONALITIES PLEASE DOCTOR SAID SIR WALTER RALEIGH THE CHAIRMAN RAPPING THE TABLE VIGOROUSLY WITH THE SHADE OF A HANDSOME GAVEL THAT HAD ONCE ADORNED THE ROMAN SENATE CHAMBER
474-141425-0016 HE'S ONLY A CHINAMAN MUTTERED JOHNSON WHAT WAS THE SIGHT THAT GREETED YOUR EYES CONFUCIUS ASKED CASSIUS OMAR KHAYYAM STRETCHED OVER FIVE OF THE MOST COMFORTABLE CHAIRS IN THE LIBRARY RETURNED CONFUCIUS
474-141425-0017 AND WHEN I VENTURED TO REMONSTRATE WITH HIM HE LOST HIS TEMPER AND SAID I'D SPOILED THE WHOLE SECOND VOLUME OF THE RUBAIYAT I TOLD HIM HE OUGHT TO DO HIS RUBAIYATTING AT HOME AND HE MADE A SCENE TO AVOID WHICH I HASTENED WITH MY GUEST OVER TO THE BILLIARD ROOM
474-141425-0018 AND THERE STRETCHED AT FULL LENGTH ON THE POOL TABLE WAS ROBERT BURNS TRYING TO WRITE A SONNET ON THE CLOTH WITH CHALK IN LESS TIME THAN VILLON COULD TURN OUT ANOTHER WITH TWO LINES START ON THE BILLIARD TABLE WITH THE SAME WRITING MATERIALS
474-141425-0019 NOW I ASK YOU GENTLEMEN IF THESE THINGS ARE TO BE TOLERATED ARE THEY NOT RATHER TO BE REPREHENDED WHETHER I AM A CHINAMAN OR NOT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE US DO THEN ASKED SIR WALTER RALEIGH A LITTLE NETTLED
474-141425-0020 OH BUT NOT MUCH OF ONE SIR WALTER PUT IN DOCTOR JOHNSON DEPRECATINGLY NO SAID CONFUCIUS I DON'T WANT THEM EXCLUDED BUT THEY SHOULD BE CONTROLLED YOU DON'T LET A SHOEMAKER WHO HAS BECOME A MEMBER OF THIS CLUB
474-141425-0021 TURN THE LIBRARY SOFAS INTO BENCHES AND GO PEGGING AWAY AT BOOT MAKING SO WHY SHOULD YOU LET THE POETS TURN THE PLACE INTO A VERSE FACTORY THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW I DON'T KNOW BUT WHAT YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN SAID BLACKSTONE
474-141425-0022 THOUGH I CAN'T SAY I THINK YOUR PARALLELS ARE VERY PARALLEL A SHOEMAKER MY DEAR CONFUCIUS IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM A POET CERTAINLY SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON VERY DIFFERENT IN FACT DIFFERENT ENOUGH TO MAKE A CONUNDRUM OF THE QUESTION
474-141425-0023 WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SHOEMAKER AND A POET ONE MAKES THE SHOES AND THE OTHER SHAKES THE MUSE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD STILL I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN EXCLUDE THE POETS IT IS THE VERY DEMOCRACY OF THIS CLUB THAT GIVES IT LIFE WE TAKE IN EVERYBODY
474-141425-0024 TO SAY THAT THIS MAN SHALL NOT ENTER BECAUSE HE IS THIS OR THAT OR THE OTHER THING WOULD RESULT IN OUR ULTIMATELY BECOMING A CLASS ORGANIZATION WHICH AS CONFUCIUS HIMSELF SAYS WE ARE NOT AND MUST NOT BE
474-141425-0025 IF WE PUT OUT THE POET TO PLEASE THE SAGE WE'LL SOON HAVE TO PUT OUT THE SAGE TO PLEASE THE FOOL AND SO ON WE'LL KEEP IT UP ONCE THE PRECEDENT IS ESTABLISHED
474-141425-0026 A PLUMBERS CLUB FOR INSTANCE AND HOW ABSURD THAT WOULD BE IN HADES NO GENTLEMEN IT CAN'T BE DONE THE POETS MUST AND SHALL BE PRESERVED WHAT'S THE OBJECTION TO CLASS CLUBS ANYHOW ASKED CASSIUS I DON'T OBJECT TO THEM
474-141425-0027 IF WE COULD HAVE HAD POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS IN MY DAY I MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD TO FALL ON MY SWORD TO GET OUT OF KEEPING AN ENGAGEMENT I HAD NO FANCY FOR CLASS CLUBS HAVE THEIR USES NO DOUBT SAID DEMOSTHENES
474-141425-0028 HAVE ALL THE CLASS CLUBS YOU WANT BUT DO NOT MAKE ONE OF THIS AN AUTHORS CLUB WHERE NONE BUT AUTHORS ARE ADMITTED IS A GOOD THING
474-141425-0029 POETS CLUBS ARE A GOOD THING
474-141425-0030 PUGILISTS CLUBS ARE GOOD SO ARE ALL OTHER CLASS CLUBS BUT SO ALSO ARE CLUBS LIKE OUR OWN WHICH TAKES IN ALL WHO ARE WORTHY
474-141425-0031 WE MUST STICK TO OUR ORIGINAL IDEA THEN LET US DO SOMETHING TO ABATE THE NUISANCE OF WHICH I COMPLAIN SAID CONFUCIUS CAN'T WE ADOPT A HOUSE RULE
474-141425-0032 THAT POETS MUST NOT BE INSPIRED BETWEEN THE HOURS OF ELEVEN A M AND FIVE P M OR IN THE EVENING AFTER EIGHT THAT ANY POET DISCOVERED USING MORE THAN FIVE ARM CHAIRS IN THE COMPOSITION OF A QUATRAIN WILL BE CHARGED TWO OBOLI AN HOUR FOR EACH CHAIR IN EXCESS OF THAT NUMBER
474-141425-0033 AND THAT THE BILLIARD MARKER SHALL BE REQUIRED TO CHARGE A PREMIUM OF THREE TIMES THE ORDINARY FEE FOR TABLES USED BY VERSIFIERS IN LIEU OF WRITING PADS THAT WOULDN'T BE A BAD IDEA SAID SIR WALTER RALEIGH
474-141425-0034 I AS A POET WOULD NOT OBJECT TO THAT I DO ALL MY WORK AT HOME ANYHOW THERE'S ANOTHER PHASE OF THIS BUSINESS THAT WE HAVEN'T CONSIDERED YET AND IT'S RATHER IMPORTANT SAID DEMOSTHENES
474-141425-0035 THAT'S IN THE MATTER OF STATIONERY THIS CLUB LIKE ALL OTHER WELL REGULATED CLUBS PROVIDES ITS MEMBERS WITH A SUITABLE SUPPLY OF WRITING MATERIALS
474-141425-0036 CHARON INFORMS ME THAT THE WASTE BASKETS LAST WEEK TURNED OUT FORTY TWO REAMS OF OUR BEST CORRESPONDENCE PAPER ON WHICH THESE POETS HAD SCRIBBLED THE FIRST DRAFT OF THEIR VERSES
474-141425-0037 NOW I DON'T THINK THE CLUB SHOULD FURNISH THE POETS WITH THE RAW MATERIAL FOR THEIR POEMS ANY MORE THAN TO GO BACK TO CONFUCIUS'S SHOEMAKER
474-141425-0038 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY RAW MATERIAL FOR POEMS ASKED SIR WALTER WITH A FROWN PEN INK AND PAPER WHAT ELSE SAID DEMOSTHENES DOESN'T IT TAKE BRAINS TO WRITE A POEM SAID RALEIGH
474-141425-0039 DOESN'T IT TAKE BRAINS TO MAKE A PAIR OF SHOES RETORTED DEMOSTHENES SWALLOWING A PEBBLE IN HIS HASTE THEY'VE GOT A RIGHT TO THE STATIONERY THOUGH PUT IN BLACKSTONE A CLEAR LEGAL RIGHT TO IT
474-141425-0040 THAT'S THEIR OWN AFFAIR WELL THEY'RE VERY WASTEFUL SAID DEMOSTHENES WE CAN MEET THAT EASILY ENOUGH OBSERVED CASSIUS FURNISH EACH WRITING TABLE WITH A SLATE I SHOULD THINK THEY'D BE PLEASED WITH THAT IT'S SO MUCH EASIER TO RUB OUT THE WRONG WORD
474-141425-0041 MOST POETS PREFER TO RUB OUT THE RIGHT WORD GROWLED CONFUCIUS BESIDES I SHALL NEVER CONSENT TO SLATES IN THIS HOUSE BOAT THE SQUEAKING OF THE PENCILS WOULD BE WORSE THAN THE POEMS THEMSELVES THAT'S TRUE
474-141425-0042 SAID CASSIUS I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT IF A DOZEN POETS GOT TO WORK ON THOSE SLATES AT ONCE A FIFE CORPS WOULDN'T BE A CIRCUMSTANCE TO THEM WELL IT ALL GOES TO PROVE WHAT I HAVE THOUGHT ALL ALONG SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON HOMER'S IDEA IS A GOOD ONE
474-141425-0043 AND SAMSON WAS WISE IN BACKING IT UP THE POETS NEED TO BE CONCENTRATED SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY WILL NOT BE A NUISANCE TO OTHER PEOPLE AND WHERE OTHER PEOPLE WILL NOT BE A NUISANCE TO THEM HOMER OUGHT TO HAVE A PLACE TO COMPOSE IN WHERE THE VINGT ET UN PLAYERS WILL NOT INTERRUPT HIS FRENZIES
474-141425-0044 AND ON THE OTHER HAND THE VINGT ET UN AND OTHER PLAYERS SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM THE WOOERS OF THE MUSE I'LL VOTE TO HAVE THE POETS CORNER AND IN IT I MOVE THAT CASSIUS'S SLATE IDEA BE CARRIED OUT IT WILL BE A GREAT SAVING
474-141425-0045 AND IF THE CORNER WE SELECT BE FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE OTHER CORNERS OF THE CLUB THE SQUEAKING OF THE SLATE PENCILS NEED BOTHER NO ONE I AGREE TO THAT SAID BLACKSTONE ONLY I THINK IT SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD THAT IN GRANTING THE PETITION OF THE POETS
474-141425-0046 WE DO NOT BIND OURSELVES TO YIELD TO DOCTORS AND LAWYERS AND SHOEMAKERS AND PLUMBERS IN CASE THEY SHOULD EACH WANT A CORNER TO THEMSELVES A VERY WISE IDEA SAID SIR WALTER WHEREUPON THE RESOLUTION WAS SUITABLY WORDED AND PASSED UNANIMOUSLY
