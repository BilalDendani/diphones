5868-54659-0000 WHICH THE POPULAR NOTIONS ARE FOND OF CHARACTERISING BY A STIFF STATELY CARRIAGE BY A RIGID EXPRESSION OF FEATURES BY A HARD SEVERE INTONATION OF VOICE BY SET SPEECHES OF CONTEMPT FOR POVERTY AND RAGS AND RHAPSODICAL
5868-54659-0001 BRAGGADOCIO ABOUT RANK AND BREEDING MY FATHER'S PRIDE HAD NOTHING OF THIS ABOUT IT IT WAS THAT QUIET NEGATIVE COURTEOUS INBRED PRIDE WHICH ONLY THE CLOSEST OBSERVATION COULD DETECT
5868-54659-0002 WHICH NO ORDINARY OBSERVERS EVER DETECTED AT ALL WHO THAT OBSERVED HIM IN COMMUNICATION WITH ANY OF THE FARMERS ON ANY OF HIS ESTATES WHO THAT SAW THE MANNER IN WHICH HE LIFTED HIS HAT
5868-54659-0003 WHEN HE ACCIDENTALLY MET ANY OF THOSE FARMERS WIVES WHO THAT NOTICED HIS HEARTY WELCOME TO THE MAN OF THE PEOPLE WHEN THAT MAN HAPPENED TO BE A MAN OF GENIUS WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIM PROUD
5868-54659-0004 ON SUCH OCCASIONS AS THESE IF HE HAD ANY PRIDE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETECT IT BUT SEEING HIM WHEN FOR INSTANCE AN AUTHOR AND A NEW MADE PEER OF NO ANCESTRY ENTERED HIS HOUSE TOGETHER
5868-54659-0005 OBSERVING MERELY THE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MANNER IN WHICH HE SHOOK HANDS WITH EACH REMARKING THAT THE POLITE CORDIALITY WAS ALL FOR THE MAN OF LETTERS WHO DID NOT CONTEST HIS FAMILY RANK WITH HIM
5868-54659-0006 AND THE POLITE FORMALITY ALL FOR THE MAN OF TITLE WHO DID YOU DISCOVERED WHERE AND HOW HE WAS PROUD IN AN INSTANT HERE LAY HIS FRETFUL POINT
5868-54659-0007 THE ARISTOCRACY OF RANK AS SEPARATE FROM THE ARISTOCRACY OF ANCESTRY WAS NO ARISTOCRACY FOR HIM HE WAS JEALOUS OF IT HE HATED IT COMMONER THOUGH HE WAS HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF THE SOCIAL SUPERIOR
5868-54659-0008 OF ANY MAN FROM A BARONET UP TO A DUKE WHOSE FAMILY WAS LESS ANCIENT THAN HIS OWN AMONG A HOST OF INSTANCES OF THIS PECULIAR PRIDE OF HIS WHICH I COULD CITE I REMEMBER ONE CHARACTERISTIC ENOUGH TO BE TAKEN AS A SAMPLE
5868-54659-0009 OF ALL THE REST IT HAPPENED WHEN I WAS QUITE A CHILD AND WAS TOLD ME BY ONE OF MY UNCLES NOW DEAD WHO WITNESSED THE CIRCUMSTANCE HIMSELF AND ALWAYS MADE A GOOD STORY OF IT TO THE END OF HIS LIFE A MERCHANT OF ENORMOUS WEALTH
5868-54659-0010 WHO HAD RECENTLY BEEN RAISED TO THE PEERAGE WAS STAYING AT ONE OF OUR COUNTRY HOUSES HIS DAUGHTER MY UNCLE AND AN ITALIAN ABBE WERE THE ONLY GUESTS BESIDES THE MERCHANT WAS A PORTLY PURPLE FACED MAN WHO BORE HIS NEW HONOURS
5868-54659-0011 WITH A CURIOUS MIXTURE OF ASSUMED POMPOSITY AND NATURAL GOOD HUMOUR THE ABBE WAS DWARFISH AND DEFORMED LEAN SALLOW SHARP FEATURED WITH BRIGHT BIRD LIKE EYES AND A LOW LIQUID VOICE
5868-54659-0012 HE WAS A POLITICAL REFUGEE DEPENDENT FOR THE BREAD HE ATE ON THE MONEY HE RECEIVED FOR TEACHING LANGUAGES HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BEGGAR FROM THE STREETS AND STILL MY FATHER WOULD HAVE TREATED HIM AS THE PRINCIPAL GUEST IN THE HOUSE FOR THIS ALL SUFFICIENT REASON
5868-54659-0013 HE WAS A DIRECT DESCENDANT OF ONE OF THE OLDEST OF THOSE FAMOUS ROMAN FAMILIES WHOSE NAMES ARE PART OF THE HISTORY OF THE CIVIL WARS IN ITALY ON THE FIRST DAY THE PARTY ASSEMBLED FOR DINNER COMPRISED THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
5868-54659-0014 MY MOTHER AN OLD LADY WHO HAD ONCE BEEN HER GOVERNESS AND HAD ALWAYS LIVED WITH HER SINCE HER MARRIAGE THE NEW LORD THE ABBE MY FATHER AND MY UNCLE
5868-54659-0015 WHEN DINNER WAS ANNOUNCED THE PEER ADVANCED IN NEW BLOWN DIGNITY TO OFFER HIS ARM AS A MATTER OF COURSE TO MY MOTHER MY FATHER'S PALE FACE FLUSHED CRIMSON IN A MOMENT HE TOUCHED THE MAGNIFICENT MERCHANT LORD ON THE ARM AND POINTED SIGNIFICANTLY
5868-54659-0016 WITH A LOW BOW TOWARDS THE DECREPIT OLD LADY WHO HAD ONCE BEEN MY MOTHER'S GOVERNESS THEN WALKING TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM WHERE THE PENNILESS ABBE WAS LOOKING OVER A BOOK IN A CORNER HE GRAVELY AND COURTEOUSLY LED THE LITTLE DEFORMED LIMPING LANGUAGE MASTER
5868-54659-0017 CLAD IN A LONG THREADBARE BLACK COAT UP TO MY MOTHER WHOSE SHOULDER THE ABBE'S HEAD HARDLY REACHED HELD THE DOOR OPEN FOR THEM TO PASS OUT FIRST WITH HIS OWN HAND
5868-54659-0018 TO FOLLOW WITH THE TOTTERING OLD LADY ON HIS ARM AND THEN RETURNED TO LEAD THE PEER'S DAUGHTER DOWN TO DINNER HIMSELF HE ONLY RESUMED HIS WONTED EXPRESSION AND MANNER
5868-54659-0019 WHEN HE HAD SEEN THE LITTLE ABBE THE SQUALID HALF STARVED REPRESENTATIVE OF MIGHTY BARONS OF THE OLDEN TIME SEATED AT THE HIGHEST PLACE OF THE TABLE BY MY MOTHER'S SIDE
5868-54659-0020 IT WAS BY SUCH ACCIDENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES AS THESE THAT YOU DISCOVERED HOW FAR HE WAS PROUD HE NEVER BOASTED OF HIS ANCESTORS HE NEVER EVEN SPOKE OF THEM EXCEPT WHEN HE WAS QUESTIONED ON THE SUBJECT BUT HE NEVER FORGOT THEM
5868-54659-0021 THEY WERE THE VERY BREATH OF HIS LIFE THE DEITIES OF HIS SOCIAL WORSHIP THE FAMILY TREASURES TO BE HELD PRECIOUS BEYOND ALL LANDS AND ALL WEALTH ALL AMBITIONS AND ALL GLORIES BY HIS CHILDREN AND HIS CHILDREN'S CHILDREN TO THE END OF THEIR RACE
5868-54659-0022 I BELIEVE IN HIS OWN WAY HE LOVED US ALL BUT WE HIS DESCENDANTS HAD TO SHARE HIS HEART WITH HIS ANCESTORS WE WERE HIS HOUSEHOLD PROPERTY AS WELL AS HIS CHILDREN
5868-54659-0023 EVERY FAIR LIBERTY WAS GIVEN TO US EVERY FAIR INDULGENCE WAS GRANTED TO US HE NEVER DISPLAYED ANY SUSPICION OR ANY UNDUE SEVERITY WE WERE TAUGHT BY HIS DIRECTION
5868-54659-0024 THAT TO DISGRACE OUR FAMILY EITHER BY WORD OR ACTION WAS THE ONE FATAL CRIME WHICH COULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN AND NEVER BE PARDONED WE WERE FORMED UNDER HIS SUPERINTENDENCE IN PRINCIPLES OF RELIGION HONOUR AND INDUSTRY
5868-54659-0025 AND THE REST WAS LEFT TO OUR OWN MORAL SENSE TO OUR OWN COMPREHENSION OF THE DUTIES AND PRIVILEGES OF OUR STATION THERE WAS NO ONE POINT IN HIS CONDUCT TOWARDS ANY OF US THAT WE COULD COMPLAIN OF AND YET
5868-54659-0026 THERE WAS SOMETHING ALWAYS INCOMPLETE IN OUR DOMESTIC RELATIONS IT MAY SEEM INCOMPREHENSIBLE EVEN RIDICULOUS TO SOME PERSONS BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS TRUE THAT WE WERE NONE OF US EVER ON INTIMATE TERMS WITH HIM
5868-54659-0027 I MEAN BY THIS THAT HE WAS A FATHER TO US BUT NEVER A COMPANION THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS MANNER HIS QUIET AND UNCHANGING MANNER WHICH KEPT US ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY RESTRAINED
5868-54659-0028 I NEVER IN MY LIFE FELT LESS AT MY EASE I KNEW NOT WHY AT THE TIME THAN WHEN I OCCASIONALLY DINED ALONE WITH HIM I NEVER CONFIDED TO HIM MY SCHEMES FOR AMUSEMENT AS A BOY
5868-54659-0029 OR MENTIONED MORE THAN GENERALLY MY AMBITIOUS HOPES AS A YOUNG MAN
5868-54659-0030 BUT THAT HE SEEMED ABOVE THEM UNFITTED TO ENTER INTO THEM TOO FAR REMOVED BY HIS OWN THOUGHTS FROM SUCH THOUGHTS AS OURS THUS ALL HOLIDAY COUNCILS WERE HELD WITH OLD SERVANTS THUS
5868-54659-0031 MY FIRST PAGES OF MANUSCRIPT WHEN I FIRST TRIED AUTHORSHIP WERE READ BY MY SISTER AND NEVER PENETRATED INTO MY FATHER'S STUDY AGAIN HIS MODE OF TESTIFYING DISPLEASURE TOWARDS MY BROTHER OR MYSELF
5868-54659-0032 ANY IRRITATION HE SIMPLY ALTERED HIS MANNER TOWARDS US ALTOGETHER
5868-54659-0033 BUT WHEN WE CAME IN CONTACT WITH HIM WE WERE TREATED WITH A COLD CONTEMPTUOUS POLITENESS ESPECIALLY IF OUR FAULT SHOWED A TENDENCY TO ANYTHING MEAN OR UNGENTLEMANLIKE WHICH CUT US TO THE HEART
5868-54659-0034 HIS WHOLE COURSE OF CONDUCT SAID AS THOUGH IN SO MANY WORDS YOU HAVE RENDERED YOURSELVES UNFIT TO ASSOCIATE WITH YOUR FATHER AND HE IS NOW MAKING YOU FEEL THAT UNFITNESS AS DEEPLY AS HE DOES
5868-54659-0035 WE WERE LEFT IN THIS DOMESTIC PURGATORY FOR DAYS SOMETIMES FOR WEEKS TOGETHER TO OUR BOYISH FEELINGS TO MINE ESPECIALLY THERE WAS NO IGNOMINY LIKE IT WHILE IT LASTED
5868-54659-0036 I KNOW NOT ON WHAT TERMS MY FATHER LIVED WITH MY MOTHER TOWARDS MY SISTER HIS DEMEANOUR ALWAYS EXHIBITED SOMETHING OF THE OLD FASHIONED AFFECTIONATE GALLANTRY OF A FORMER AGE
5868-54659-0037 HE PAID HER THE SAME ATTENTION THAT HE WOULD HAVE PAID TO THE HIGHEST LADY IN THE LAND HE LED HER INTO THE DINING ROOM WHEN WE WERE ALONE EXACTLY AS HE WOULD HAVE LED A DUCHESS INTO A BANQUETING HALL
5868-54659-0038 HE WOULD ALLOW US AS BOYS TO QUIT THE BREAKFAST TABLE BEFORE HE HAD RISEN HIMSELF
5868-54659-0039 THE SERVANT WAS OFTEN FORGIVEN IF TOWARDS HER THE SERVANT WAS SENT AWAY ON THE SPOT HIS DAUGHTER WAS IN HIS EYES THE REPRESENTATIVE OF HER MOTHER THE MISTRESS OF HIS HOUSE AS WELL AS HIS CHILD
5868-54659-0040 IT WAS CURIOUS TO SEE THE MIXTURE OF HIGH BRED COURTESY AND FATHERLY LOVE IN HIS MANNER AS HE JUST GENTLY TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD WITH HIS LIPS WHEN HE FIRST SAW HER IN THE MORNING IN PERSON
5868-54659-0041 WHEN I HAVE ALREADY NOTICED ITS TENDENCY TO FLUSH ALL OVER IN AN INSTANT HIS EYES LARGE AND GRAY HAD SOMETHING COMMANDING IN THEIR LOOK THEY GAVE A CERTAIN UNCHANGING FIRMNESS AND DIGNITY TO HIS EXPRESSION NOT OFTEN MET WITH
5868-54659-0042 THEY BETRAYED HIS BIRTH AND BREEDING HIS OLD ANCESTRAL PREJUDICES HIS CHIVALROUS SENSE OF HONOUR IN EVERY GLANCE IT REQUIRED INDEED ALL THE MASCULINE ENERGY OF LOOK ABOUT THE UPPER PART OF HIS FACE
5868-54659-0043 TO REDEEM THE LOWER PART FROM AN APPEARANCE OF EFFEMINACY SO DELICATELY WAS IT MOULDED IN ITS FINE NORMAN OUTLINE HIS SMILE WAS REMARKABLE FOR ITS SWEETNESS IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A WOMAN'S SMILE
5868-54659-0044 IN SPEAKING TOO HIS LIPS OFTEN TREMBLED AS WOMEN'S DO IF HE EVER LAUGHED AS A YOUNG MAN HIS LAUGH MUST HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR AND MUSICAL BUT SINCE I CAN RECOLLECT HIM I NEVER HEARD IT IN HIS HAPPIEST MOMENTS IN THE GAYEST SOCIETY
5868-54659-0045 I HAVE ONLY SEEN HIM SMILE THERE WERE OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF MY FATHER'S DISPOSITION AND MANNER WHICH I MIGHT MENTION BUT THEY WILL APPEAR TO GREATER ADVANTAGE PERHAPS HEREAFTER CONNECTED WITH CIRCUMSTANCES
