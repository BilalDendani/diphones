5023-1185-0002 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WAS A ROUND TABLE ON WHICH BREAKFAST WAS ALREADY PLACED SMOKING HOT ONLY ONE CHAIR WAS DRAWN UP TO THE TABLE WHERE A PLACE WAS SET FOR ONE PERSON NO ONE SEEMED TO BE IN THE ROOM EXCEPT THE BOY AND BUNGLE
5023-1185-0003 OJO GOT UP AND PUT ON HIS SHOES FINDING A TOILET STAND AT THE HEAD OF HIS BED HE WASHED HIS FACE AND HANDS AND BRUSHED HIS HAIR THEN HE WENT TO THE TABLE AND SAID I WONDER IF THIS IS MY BREAKFAST EAT IT COMMANDED A VOICE AT HIS SIDE
5023-1185-0004 HE WAS HUNGRY AND THE BREAKFAST LOOKED GOOD SO HE SAT DOWN AND ATE ALL HE WANTED THEN RISING HE TOOK HIS HAT AND WAKENED THE GLASS CAT COME ON BUNGLE SAID HE WE MUST GO
5023-1185-0005 HE CAST ANOTHER GLANCE ABOUT THE ROOM AND SPEAKING TO THE AIR HE SAID WHOEVER LIVES HERE HAS BEEN KIND TO ME AND I'M MUCH OBLIGED THERE WAS NO ANSWER SO HE TOOK HIS BASKET AND WENT OUT THE DOOR
5023-1185-0006 THE CAT FOLLOWING HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH SAT THE PATCHWORK GIRL PLAYING WITH PEBBLES SHE HAD PICKED UP OH THERE YOU ARE SHE EXCLAIMED CHEERFULLY I THOUGHT YOU WERE NEVER COMING OUT IT HAS BEEN DAYLIGHT A LONG TIME
5023-1185-0007 SAT HERE AND WATCHED THE STARS AND THE MOON SHE REPLIED THEY'RE INTERESTING I NEVER SAW THEM BEFORE YOU KNOW
5023-1185-0008 OF COURSE NOT SAID OJO YOU WERE CRAZY TO ACT SO BADLY AND GET THROWN OUTDOORS REMARKED BUNGLE AS THEY RENEWED THEIR JOURNEY THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID SCRAPS
5023-1185-0009 I WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN THE STARS NOR THE BIG GRAY WOLF WHAT WOLF INQUIRED OJO
5023-1185-0010 I DON'T SEE WHY THAT SHOULD BE SAID THE BOY THOUGHTFULLY THERE WAS PLENTY TO EAT IN THAT HOUSE FOR I HAD A FINE BREAKFAST AND I SLEPT IN A NICE BED DON'T YOU FEEL TIRED ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL NOTICING THAT THE BOY YAWNED
5023-1185-0011 AND AREN'T YOU HUNGRY IT'S STRANGE REPLIED OJO I HAD A GOOD BREAKFAST AND YET I THINK I'LL NOW EAT SOME OF MY CRACKERS AND CHEESE SCRAPS DANCED UP AND DOWN THE PATH THEN SHE SANG KIZZLE KAZZLE KORE THE WOLF IS AT THE DOOR
5023-1185-0012 NO SAID THE CAT SHE'S STARK STARING RAVING CRAZY
5023-1185-0013 HAVE YOU NOTICED HOW BEAUTIFUL MY PATCHES ARE IN THIS SUNLIGHT
5023-1185-0014 AND TO THE TOP WAS SCREWED FAST A PHONOGRAPH WITH A BIG GOLD HORN HOLD ON SHOUTED THE PHONOGRAPH
5023-1185-0015 GOODNESS ME IT'S THAT MUSIC THING WHICH THE CROOKED MAGICIAN SCATTERED THE POWDER OF LIFE OVER SAID OJO SO IT IS RETURNED BUNGLE IN A GRUMPY TONE OF VOICE
5023-1185-0016 AND THEN AS THE PHONOGRAPH OVERTOOK THEM THE GLASS CAT ADDED STERNLY WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ANYHOW I'VE RUN AWAY SAID THE MUSIC THING
5023-1185-0017 AFTER YOU LEFT OLD DOCTOR PIPT AND I HAD A DREADFUL QUARREL AND HE THREATENED TO SMASH ME TO PIECES IF I DIDN'T KEEP QUIET OF COURSE I WOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE A TALKING MACHINE IS SUPPOSED TO TALK AND MAKE A NOISE AND SOMETIMES MUSIC
5023-1185-0018 SO I SLIPPED OUT OF THE HOUSE WHILE THE MAGICIAN WAS STIRRING HIS FOUR KETTLES AND I'VE BEEN RUNNING AFTER YOU ALL NIGHT NOW THAT I'VE FOUND SUCH PLEASANT COMPANY I CAN TALK AND PLAY TUNES ALL I WANT TO
5023-1185-0019 OJO WAS GREATLY ANNOYED BY THIS UNWELCOME ADDITION TO THEIR PARTY AT FIRST HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THE NEWCOMER BUT A LITTLE THOUGHT DECIDED HIM NOT TO MAKE FRIENDS
5023-1185-0020 WE ARE TRAVELING ON IMPORTANT BUSINESS HE DECLARED AND YOU'LL EXCUSE ME IF I SAY WE CAN'T BE BOTHERED HOW VERY IMPOLITE EXCLAIMED THE PHONOGRAPH I'M SORRY BUT IT'S TRUE SAID THE BOY
5023-1185-0021 YOU'LL HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE THIS IS VERY UNKIND TREATMENT I MUST SAY WHINED THE PHONOGRAPH IN AN INJURED TONE EVERYONE SEEMS TO HATE ME AND YET I WAS INTENDED TO AMUSE PEOPLE IT ISN'T
5023-1185-0022 YOU WE HATE ESPECIALLY OBSERVED THE GLASS CAT
5023-1185-0023 IT GROWLS AND GRUMBLES AND CLICKS AND SCRATCHES SO IT SPOILS THE MUSIC AND YOUR MACHINERY RUMBLES SO THAT THE RACKET DROWNS EVERY TUNE YOU ATTEMPT THAT ISN'T MY FAULT IT'S THE FAULT OF MY RECORDS
5023-1185-0024 I MUST ADMIT THAT I HAVEN'T A CLEAR RECORD ANSWERED THE MACHINE JUST THE SAME YOU'LL HAVE TO GO AWAY SAID OJO WAIT A MINUTE CRIED SCRAPS THIS MUSIC THING INTERESTS ME
5023-1185-0025 I REMEMBER TO HAVE HEARD MUSIC WHEN I FIRST CAME TO LIFE AND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IT AGAIN
5023-1185-0026 VICTOR COLUMBIA EDISON IT ANSWERED
5023-1185-0027 THE ONLY RECORD I HAVE WITH ME EXPLAINED THE PHONOGRAPH
5023-1185-0028 A WHAT INQUIRED SCRAPS IT IS CLASSICAL MUSIC AND IS CONSIDERED THE BEST AND MOST PUZZLING EVER MANUFACTURED YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LIKE IT WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT
5023-1185-0029 AND IF YOU DON'T THE PROPER THING IS TO LOOK AS IF YOU DID UNDERSTAND NOT IN THE LEAST SAID SCRAPS THEN LISTEN AT ONCE THE MACHINE BEGAN TO PLAY AND IN A FEW MINUTES
5023-1185-0030 OJO PUT HIS HANDS TO HIS EARS TO SHUT OUT THE SOUNDS AND THE CAT SNARLED AND SCRAPS BEGAN TO LAUGH CUT IT OUT VIC SHE SAID THAT'S ENOUGH
5023-1185-0031 BUT THE PHONOGRAPH CONTINUED PLAYING THE DREARY TUNE SO OJO SEIZED THE CRANK JERKED IT FREE AND THREW IT INTO THE ROAD HOWEVER THE MOMENT THE CRANK STRUCK THE GROUND IT BOUNDED BACK TO THE MACHINE AGAIN AND BEGAN WINDING IT UP
5023-1185-0032 BUT THE PHONOGRAPH WAS RIGHT BEHIND THEM AND COULD RUN AND PLAY AT THE SAME TIME IT CALLED OUT REPROACHFULLY WHAT'S THE MATTER DON'T YOU LOVE CLASSICAL MUSIC NO VIC SAID SCRAPS HALTING
5023-1185-0033 WE WILL PASSICAL THE CLASSICAL AND PRESERVE WHAT JOY WE HAVE LEFT I HAVEN'T ANY NERVES THANK GOODNESS BUT YOUR MUSIC MAKES MY COTTON SHRINK THEN TURN OVER MY RECORD
5023-1185-0034 THERE'S A RAG TIME TUNE ON THE OTHER SIDE SAID THE MACHINE WHAT'S RAG TIME THE OPPOSITE OF CLASSICAL ALL RIGHT SAID SCRAPS AND TURNED OVER THE RECORD
5023-1185-0035 THE PHONOGRAPH NOW BEGAN TO PLAY A JERKY JUMBLE OF SOUNDS WHICH PROVED SO BEWILDERING
5023-1185-0036 IF YOU DON'T SHUT OFF THAT MUSIC I'LL SMASH YOUR RECORD THREATENED OJO THE MUSIC STOPPED AT THAT AND THE MACHINE TURNED ITS HORN FROM ONE TO ANOTHER AND SAID WITH GREAT INDIGNATION WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW
5023-1185-0037 IS IT POSSIBLE YOU CAN'T APPRECIATE RAG TIME SCRAPS OUGHT TO BEING RAGS HERSELF SAID THE CAT BUT I SIMPLY CAN'T STAND IT IT MAKES MY WHISKERS CURL
5023-1185-0038 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT VIC SHE ADDED AS SHE SMOOTHED OUT HER APRON AND PUT IT ON AGAIN FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER YOU'VE MISSED YOUR GUESS YOU'RE NOT A CONCERT YOU'RE A NUISANCE
5023-1185-0039 ASSERTED THE PHONOGRAPH SADLY THEN WE'RE NOT SAVAGES I ADVISE YOU TO GO HOME AND BEG THE MAGICIAN'S PARDON NEVER HE'D SMASH ME THAT'S WHAT WE SHALL DO IF YOU STAY HERE OJO DECLARED
5023-1185-0040 AND STAY WITH HIM TILL HE REPENTS IN THAT WAY YOU CAN DO SOME GOOD IN THE WORLD THE MUSIC THING TURNED SILENTLY AWAY AND TROTTED DOWN A SIDE PATH TOWARD A DISTANT MUNCHKIN VILLAGE
5023-1185-0041 IS THAT THE WAY WE GO ASKED BUNGLE ANXIOUSLY NO SAID OJO
