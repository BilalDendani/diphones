3192-4911-0001 BY AND BY IN SOME INEXPLICABLE WAY IT CAME TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS A CONSPIRACY AFLOAT THAT THEY WERE TO BE RELEASED FROM THEIR SHAMBLES THAT SOME AMONGST THEM HAD BEEN PLOTTING FOR FREEDOM THE TWEEN DECKS HELD ITS FOUL BREATH
3192-4911-0002 THE MUTINEERS HEADED BY GABBETT VETCH AND THE MOOCHER WERE NEAREST TO THE DOOR THE TIMID BOYS OLD MEN INNOCENT POOR WRETCHES CONDEMNED ON CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OR RUSTICS CONDEMNED TO BE TURNED INTO THIEVES FOR PULLING A TURNIP
3192-4911-0003 HUDDLING TOGETHER IN ALARM AND THE PRUDENT THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE REST READY TO FIGHT OR FLY ADVANCE OR RETREAT
3192-4911-0004 OCCUPIED THE MIDDLE SPACE THE MUTINEERS PROPER NUMBERED PERHAPS SOME THIRTY MEN AND OF THESE THIRTY ONLY HALF A DOZEN KNEW WHAT WAS REALLY ABOUT TO BE DONE THE SHIP'S BELL STRIKES THE HALF HOUR
3192-4911-0005 AND AS THE CRIES OF THE THREE SENTRIES PASSING THE WORD TO THE QUARTER DECK DIE AWAY GABBETT WHO HAS BEEN LEANING WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE DOOR NUDGES JEMMY VETCH
3192-4911-0006 TELL EM THE WHISPER BEING HEARD BY THOSE NEAREST THE GIANT A SILENCE ENSUES WHICH GRADUALLY SPREADS LIKE A RIPPLE OVER THE SURFACE OF THE CROWD REACHING EVEN THE BUNKS AT THE FURTHER END GENTLEMEN
3192-4911-0007 SAYS MISTER VETCH POLITELY SARCASTIC IN HIS OWN HANGDOG FASHION MYSELF AND MY FRIENDS HERE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE SHIP FOR YOU THOSE WHO LIKE TO JOIN US HAD BETTER SPEAK AT ONCE FOR IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR THEY WILL NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

3192-4911-0011 THIS PRACTICAL WAY OF PUTTING IT PRODUCES A SENSATION AND THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AT THE OTHER END LOOK IN EACH OTHER'S FACES WITH SOME ALARM A GRIM MURMUR RUNS ROUND AND SOMEBODY NEAR MISTER GABBETT
3192-4911-0012 LAUGHS A LAUGH OF MINGLED FEROCITY AND AMUSEMENT NOT REASSURING TO TIMID PEOPLE WHAT ABOUT THE SOGERS ASKED A VOICE FROM THE RANKS OF THE CAUTIOUS
3192-4911-0013 GO ON OLD MAN CRIES JEMMY VETCH TO THE GIANT RUBBING HIS THIN HANDS WITH ELDRITCH GLEE THEY'RE ALL RIGHT AND THEN HIS QUICK EARS CATCHING THE JINGLE OF ARMS HE SAID STAND BY NOW FOR THE DOOR ONE RUSH'LL DO IT
3192-4911-0014 IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK AND THE RELIEF GUARD WAS COMING FROM THE AFTER DECK THE CROWD OF PRISONERS ROUND THE DOOR HELD THEIR BREATH TO LISTEN IT'S ALL PLANNED SAYS GABBETT IN A LOW GROWL
3192-4911-0015 AND WE'RE IN AMONG THE GUARD AFORE THEY KNOW WHERE THEY ARE DRAG EM BACK INTO THE PRISON
3192-4911-0016 THE TONE WAS AN ORDINARY ONE AND MILES WAS THE SOLDIER WHOM SARAH PURFOY HAD BRIBED NOT TO FIRE ALL HAD GONE WELL THE KEYS CLASHED AND TURNED AND THE BRAVEST OF THE PRUDENT PARTY
3192-4911-0017 WHO HAD BEEN TURNING IN HIS MIND THE NOTION OF RISKING HIS LIFE FOR A PARDON TO BE WON BY RUSHING FORWARD AT THE RIGHT MOMENT AND ALARMING THE GUARD CHECKED THE CRY THAT WAS IN HIS THROAT AS HE SAW THE MEN ROUND THE DOOR DRAW BACK A LITTLE FOR THEIR RUSH AND CAUGHT A GLIMPSE
3192-4911-0018 OF THE GIANT'S BRISTLING SCALP AND BARED GUMS NOW CRIES JEMMY VETCH AS THE IRON PLATED OAK SWUNG BACK AND WITH THE GUTTURAL SNARL OF A CHARGING WILD BOAR
3192-4911-0019 THE RED LINE OF LIGHT WHICH GLOWED FOR AN INSTANT THROUGH THE DOORWAY WAS BLOTTED OUT BY A MASS OF FIGURES ALL THE PRISON SURGED FORWARD AND BEFORE THE EYE COULD WINK FIVE TEN TWENTY OF THE MOST DESPERATE WERE OUTSIDE
3192-4911-0020 IT WAS AS THOUGH A SEA BREAKING AGAINST A STONE WALL HAD FOUND SOME BREACH
3192-4911-0021 THE CONTAGION OF BATTLE SPREAD CAUTION WAS FORGOTTEN
3192-4911-0022 RESPONDED TO HIS GRIN OF ENCOURAGEMENT BY RUSHING FURIOUSLY FORWARD SUDDENLY A HORRIBLE ROAR LIKE THAT OF A TRAPPED WILD BEAST WAS HEARD THE RUSHING TORRENT CHOKED IN THE DOORWAY
3192-4911-0023 A FLASH BROKE FOLLOWED BY A GROAN AS THE PERFIDIOUS SENTRY FELL BACK SHOT THROUGH THE BREAST THE MASS IN THE DOORWAY HUNG IRRESOLUTE AND THEN BY SHEER WEIGHT OF PRESSURE FROM BEHIND BURST FORWARD AND AS IT SO BURST
3192-4911-0024 ALL THIS TOOK PLACE BY ONE OF THOSE SIMULTANEOUS MOVEMENTS WHICH ARE SO RAPID IN EXECUTION SO TEDIOUS TO DESCRIBE IN DETAIL AT ONE INSTANT THE PRISON DOOR HAD OPENED AT THE NEXT IT HAD CLOSED
3192-4911-0025 THE REPORT OF ANOTHER SHOT AND THEN A NOISE OF CONFUSED CRIES MINGLED WITH THE CLASHING OF ARMS INFORMED THE IMPRISONED MEN THAT THE SHIP HAD BEEN ALARMED
3192-4911-0026 WOULD THEY SUCCEED IN OVERCOMING THE GUARDS OR WOULD THEY BE BEATEN BACK THEY WOULD SOON KNOW AND IN THE HOT DUSK STRAINING THEIR EYES TO SEE EACH OTHER THEY WAITED FOR THE ISSUE SUDDENLY THE NOISES CEASED
3192-4911-0027 WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE THIS THE MEN POURING OUT OF THE DARKNESS INTO THE SUDDEN GLARE OF THE LANTERNS RUSHED BEWILDERED ACROSS THE DECK MILES TRUE TO HIS PROMISE DID NOT FIRE
3192-4911-0028 BUT THE NEXT INSTANT VICKERS HAD SNATCHED THE FIRELOCK FROM HIM AND LEAPING INTO THE STREAM
3192-4911-0029 THE ATTACK WAS MORE SUDDEN THEN HE HAD EXPECTED BUT HE DID NOT LOSE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND THE SHOT WOULD SERVE A DOUBLE PURPOSE IT WOULD WARN THE MEN IN THE BARRACK AND PERHAPS CHECK THE RUSH BY STOPPING UP THE DOORWAY WITH A CORPSE
3192-4911-0030 BEATEN BACK STRUGGLING AND INDIGNANT AMID THE STORM OF HIDEOUS FACES HIS HUMANITY VANISHED AND HE AIMED DELIBERATELY AT THE HEAD OF MISTER JAMES VETCH THE SHOT HOWEVER MISSED ITS MARK AND KILLED THE UNHAPPY MILES
3192-4911-0031 GABBETT AND HIS COMPANIONS HAD BY THIS TIME REACHED THE FOOT OF THE COMPANION LADDER THERE TO ENCOUNTER THE CUTLASSES OF THE DOUBLED GUARD GLEAMING REDLY IN THE GLOW OF THE LANTERNS
3192-4911-0032 A GLANCE UP THE HATCHWAY SHOWED THE GIANT THAT THE ARMS HE HAD PLANNED TO SEIZE WERE DEFENDED BY TEN FIRELOCKS AND THAT BEHIND THE OPEN DOORS OF THE PARTITION WHICH RAN ABAFT THE MIZENMAST THE REMAINDER OF THE DETACHMENT STOOD TO THEIR ARMS
3192-4911-0033 JUST IN TIME TO SEE THE CROWD IN THE GANGWAY RECOIL FROM THE FLASH OF THE MUSKET FIRED BY VICKERS THE NEXT INSTANT PINE AND TWO SOLDIERS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE MOMENTARY CESSATION OF THE PRESS SHOT THE BOLTS AND SECURED THE PRISON
3192-4911-0034 THE MUTINEERS WERE CAUGHT IN A TRAP THE NARROW SPACE BETWEEN THE BARRACKS AND THE BARRICADE WAS CHOKED WITH STRUGGLING FIGURES SOME TWENTY CONVICTS AND HALF AS MANY SOLDIERS STRUCK AND STABBED AT EACH OTHER IN THE CROWD THERE WAS BARELY ELBOW ROOM
3192-4911-0035 FOUGHT ALMOST WITHOUT KNOWING WHOM THEY STRUCK GABBETT TORE A CUTLASS FROM A SOLDIER SHOOK HIS HUGE HEAD AND CALLING ON THE MOOCHER TO FOLLOW BOUNDED UP THE LADDER DESPERATELY DETERMINED TO BRAVE THE FIRE OF THE WATCH THE MOOCHER
3192-4911-0036 CLOSE AT THE GIANT'S HEELS FLUNG HIMSELF UPON THE NEAREST SOLDIER AND GRASPING HIS WRIST STRUGGLED FOR THE CUTLASS
3192-4911-0037 DASHED HIS CLENCHED FIST IN THE SOLDIER'S FACE AND THE MAN MADDENED BY THE BLOW LET GO THE CUTLASS AND DRAWING HIS PISTOL SHOT HIS NEW ASSAILANT THROUGH THE HEAD
3192-4911-0038 AT THE SIGHT OF THIS UNEXPECTED ADVERSARY AND TOO CLOSE TO STRIKE HIM LOCKED HIM IN HIS ARMS THE TWO MEN WERE DRAWN TOGETHER THE GUARD ON THE QUARTER DECK DARED NOT FIRE AT THE TWO BODIES THAT TWINED ABOUT EACH OTHER ROLLED ACROSS THE DECK
3192-4911-0039 AND FOR A MOMENT MISTER FRERE'S CHERISHED EXISTENCE HUNG UPON THE SLENDEREST THREAD IMAGINABLE THE MOOCHER SPATTERED WITH THE BLOOD AND BRAINS OF HIS UNFORTUNATE COMRADE HAD ALREADY SET HIS FOOT UPON THE LOWEST STEP OF THE LADDER
3192-4911-0040 WHEN THE CUTLASS WAS DASHED FROM HIS HAND BY A BLOW FROM A CLUBBED FIRELOCK AND HE WAS DRAGGED ROUGHLY BACKWARDS AS HE FELL UPON THE DECK HE SAW THE CROW SPRING OUT OF THE MASS OF PRISONERS WHO HAD BEEN AN INSTANT BEFORE STRUGGLING WITH THE GUARD AND
3192-4911-0041 GAINING THE CLEARED SPACE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LADDER HOLD UP HIS HANDS AS THOUGH TO SHIELD HIMSELF FROM A BLOW
3192-4911-0042 AND UPON THE GROUP BEFORE THE BARRICADE HAD FALLEN THAT MYSTERIOUS SILENCE WHICH HAD PERPLEXED THE INMATES OF THE PRISON THEY WERE NOT PERPLEXED FOR LONG THE TWO SOLDIERS WHO WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF PINE HAD FORCED TO THE DOOR OF THE PRISON
3192-4911-0043 RAPIDLY UNBOLTED THAT TRAP DOOR IN THE BARRICADE OF WHICH MENTION HAS BEEN MADE IN A PREVIOUS CHAPTER AND AT A SIGNAL FROM VICKERS THREE MEN RAN THE LOADED HOWITZER FROM ITS SINISTER SHELTER NEAR THE BREAK OF THE BARRACK BERTHS AND
3192-4911-0044 TRAINING THE DEADLY MUZZLE TO A LEVEL WITH THE OPENING IN THE BARRICADE STOOD READY TO FIRE SURRENDER CRIED VICKERS
3192-4911-0045 THERE WAS AN AWFUL MOMENT OF SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY A SKURRYING NOISE IN THE PRISON AS THOUGH A FAMILY OF RATS DISTURBED AT A FLOUR CASK WERE SCAMPERING TO THE SHIP'S SIDE FOR SHELTER
3192-4911-0046 THIS SKURRYING NOISE WAS MADE BY THE CONVICTS RUSHING TO THEIR BERTHS TO ESCAPE THE THREATENED SHOWER OF GRAPE TO THE TWENTY DESPERADOES COWERING BEFORE THE MUZZLE OF THE HOWITZER IT SPOKE MORE ELOQUENTLY THAN WORDS THE CHARM WAS BROKEN
3192-4911-0047 ON EACH SIDE OF THIS HORRIBLE WINDOW ALMOST PUSHED BEFORE IT BY THE PRESSURE OF ONE UPON THE OTHER STOOD PINE VICKERS AND THE GUARD IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE GROUP LAY THE CORPSE OF THE MISERABLE BOY WHOM SARAH PURFOY HAD LED TO RUIN
3192-4911-0048 AND FORCED CLOSE UPON YET SHRINKING BACK FROM THE TRAMPLED AND BLOODY MASS CROUCHED IN MINGLED TERROR AND RAGE THE TWENTY MUTINEERS BEHIND THE MUTINEERS WITHDRAWN FROM THE PATCH OF LIGHT THROWN BY THE OPEN HATCHWAY THE MOUTH OF THE HOWITZER THREATENED DESTRUCTION
3192-4911-0049 AND BEHIND THE HOWITZER BACKED UP BY AN ARRAY OF BROWN MUSKET BARRELS
3192-4911-0050 BUT THE GUARD HAD ALREADY CLOSED IN UPON IT AND SOME OF THE SHIP'S CREW WITH THAT CARELESSNESS OF DANGER CHARACTERISTIC OF SAILORS WERE PEERING DOWN UPON THEM ESCAPE WAS HOPELESS ONE MINUTE CRIED VICKERS
3192-4911-0051 CONFIDENT THAT ONE SECOND WOULD BE ENOUGH ONE MINUTE TO GO QUIETLY OR SURRENDER MATES FOR GOD'S SAKE SHRIEKED SOME UNKNOWN WRETCH
3192-4911-0052 JEMMY VETCH FEELING BY THAT CURIOUS SYMPATHY WHICH NERVOUS NATURES POSSESS THAT HIS COMRADES WISHED HIM TO ACT AS SPOKESMAN
3192-4911-0053 WE SURRENDER HE SAID IT'S NO USE GETTING OUR BRAINS BLOWN OUT AND RAISING HIS HANDS HE OBEYED THE MOTION OF VICKERS'S FINGERS AND LED THE WAY TOWARDS THE BARRACK BRING THE IRONS FORWARD THERE SHOUTED VICKERS HASTENING FROM HIS PERILOUS POSITION
