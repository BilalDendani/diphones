5929-57805-0000 THE BAD STATE OF AFFAIRS TROUBLED HIM MORE THAN IT DID ANY ONE ELSE BUT HE COULD THINK OF NO WAY TO MAKE THEM BETTER I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE THINGS GOING ON SO BADLY HE SAID TO THE QUEEN AND HIS CHIEF COUNCILLORS I WISH I KNEW HOW OTHER KINGDOMS WERE GOVERNED
5929-57805-0001 ONE OF HIS COUNCILLORS OFFERED TO GO TO SOME OTHER COUNTRIES AND SEE HOW THEY WERE GOVERNED AND COME BACK AND TELL HIM ALL ABOUT IT BUT THIS DID NOT SUIT HIS MAJESTY YOU WOULD SIMPLY RETURN HE SAID AND GIVE ME YOUR IDEAS ABOUT THINGS I WANT MY OWN IDEAS
5929-57805-0002 THE QUEEN THEN SUGGESTED THAT HE SHOULD TAKE A VACATION AND VISIT OTHER KINGDOMS AND SEE FOR HIMSELF HOW THINGS WERE MANAGED IN THEM THIS DID NOT SUIT THE KING A VACATION WOULD NOT ANSWER HE SAID
5929-57805-0003 I SHOULD NOT BE GONE A WEEK BEFORE SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN HERE WHICH WOULD MAKE IT NECESSARY FOR ME TO COME BACK THE QUEEN THEN SUGGESTED THAT HE BE BANISHED FOR A CERTAIN TIME SAY A YEAR IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT COME BACK AND WOULD BE AT FULL LIBERTY TO VISIT FOREIGN KINGDOMS
5929-57805-0004 IF IT WERE MADE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO COME BACK HE SAID OF COURSE I COULD NOT DO IT THE SCHEME IS A GOOD ONE LET ME BE BANISHED AND HE GAVE ORDERS THAT HIS COUNCIL SHOULD PASS A LAW BANISHING HIM FOR ONE YEAR PREPARATIONS WERE IMMEDIATELY BEGUN TO CARRY OUT THIS PLAN
5929-57805-0005 AND AT SHOUTING DISTANCE BEHIND HIM WALKED ANOTHER AND SO ON AT DISTANCES OF ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM EACH OTHER IN THIS WAY THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE A LINE OF MEN EXTENDING FROM THE KING TO HIS PALACE WHENEVER THE KING HAD WALKED A HUNDRED YARDS THE LINE MOVED ON AFTER HIM
5929-57805-0006 AND ANOTHER OFFICER WAS PUT IN THE GAP BETWEEN THE LAST MAN AND THE PALACE DOOR THUS AS THE KING WALKED ON HIS LINE OF FOLLOWERS LENGTHENED AND WAS NEVER BROKEN WHENEVER HE HAD ANY MESSAGE TO SEND TO THE QUEEN OR ANY OTHER PERSON IN THE PALACE HE SHOUTED IT TO THE OFFICER NEXT HIM
5929-57805-0007 WHO SHOUTED IT TO THE ONE NEXT TO HIM AND IT WAS SO PASSED ON UNTIL IT REACHED THE PALACE IF HE NEEDED FOOD CLOTHES OR ANY OTHER NECESSARY THING THE ORDER FOR IT WAS SHOUTED ALONG THE LINE AND THE ARTICLE WAS PASSED TO HIM FROM MAN TO MAN
5929-57805-0008 EACH ONE CARRYING IT FORWARD TO HIS NEIGHBOR AND THEN RETIRING TO HIS PROPER PLACE IN THIS WAY THE KING WALKED ON DAY BY DAY UNTIL HE HAD PASSED ENTIRELY OUT OF HIS OWN KINGDOM AT NIGHT HE STOPPED AT SOME CONVENIENT HOUSE ON THE ROAD
5929-57805-0009 AND IF ANY OF HIS FOLLOWERS DID NOT FIND HIMSELF NEAR A HOUSE OR COTTAGE WHEN THE KING SHOUTED BACK THE ORDER TO HALT HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN TO SLEEP WHEREVER HE MIGHT BE BY THIS TIME THE INCREASING LINE OF FOLLOWERS HAD USED UP ALL THE OFFICERS OF THE COURT
5929-57805-0010 AND IT BECAME NECESSARY TO DRAW UPON SOME OF THE UNDER GOVERNMENT OFFICERS IN ORDER TO KEEP THE LINE PERFECT THE KING HAD NOT GONE VERY FAR OUTSIDE THE LIMITS OF HIS DOMINIONS WHEN HE MET A SPHINX HE HAD OFTEN HEARD OF THESE CREATURES ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE
5929-57805-0011 BUT WHEN HE SAW THE WINGED BODY OF A LION WITH A WOMAN'S HEAD HE KNEW INSTANTLY WHAT IT WAS HE KNEW ALSO THAT THE CHIEF BUSINESS OF A SPHINX WAS THAT OF ASKING PEOPLE QUESTIONS AND THEN GETTING THEM INTO TROUBLE IF THE RIGHT ANSWERS WERE NOT GIVEN
5929-57805-0012 HE THEREFORE DETERMINED THAT HE WOULD NOT BE CAUGHT BY ANY SUCH TRICKS AS THESE AND THAT HE WOULD BE ON HIS GUARD IF THE SPHINX SPOKE TO HIM THE CREATURE WAS LYING DOWN WHEN THE KING FIRST SAW IT BUT WHEN HE APPROACHED NEARER IT ROSE TO ITS FEET THERE WAS NOTHING SAVAGE ABOUT ITS LOOK
5929-57805-0013 SAID THE SPHINX TO HIM IN A PLEASANT VOICE GIVE IT UP REPLIED THE KING WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT SAID THE OTHER WITH AN AIR OF SURPRISE I GIVE THAT UP TOO SAID THE KING THE SPHINX THEN LOOKED AT HIM QUITE ASTONISHED
5929-57805-0014 I DON'T MIND TELLING YOU SAID THE KING OF MY OWN FREE WILL AND NOT IN ANSWER TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT I DO NOT KNOW WHERE I AM GOING I AM A KING AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED AND I HAVE BEEN BANISHED FROM MY KINGDOM FOR A YEAR
5929-57805-0015 I AM NOW GOING TO LOOK INTO THE GOVERNMENT OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN ORDER THAT I MAY FIND OUT WHAT IT IS THAT IS WRONG IN MY OWN KINGDOM EVERY THING GOES BADLY AND THERE IS SOMETHING VERY FAULTY AT THE BOTTOM OF IT ALL WHAT THIS IS I WANT TO DISCOVER
5929-57805-0016 I AM MUCH INTERESTED IN PUZZLES AND MATTERS OF THAT KIND SAID THE SPHINX AND IF YOU LIKE I WILL GO WITH YOU AND HELP TO FIND OUT WHAT IS WRONG IN YOUR KINGDOM ALL RIGHT SAID THE KING
5929-57805-0017 I SHALL BE GLAD OF YOUR COMPANY WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS LONG LINE OF PEOPLE FOLLOWING YOU AT REGULAR DISTANCES ASKED THE SPHINX GIVE IT UP SAID THE KING THE SPHINX LAUGHED
5929-57805-0018 I DON'T MIND TELLING YOU SAID THE KING OF MY OWN FREE WILL AND NOT IN ANSWER TO ANY QUESTION THAT THESE MEN FORM A LINE OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ME AND MY KINGDOM WHERE MATTERS I FEAR MUST BE GOING ON WORSE THAN EVER IN MY ABSENCE
5929-57805-0019 THE TWO NOW TRAVELLED ON TOGETHER UNTIL THEY CAME TO A HIGH HILL FROM WHICH THEY COULD SEE NOT VERY FAR AWAY A LARGE CITY THAT CITY SAID THE SPHINX IS THE CAPITAL OF AN EXTENSIVE COUNTRY
5929-57805-0020 IT IS GOVERNED BY A KING OF MINGLED SENTIMENTS SUPPOSE WE GO THERE I THINK YOU WILL FIND A GOVERNMENT THAT IS RATHER PECULIAR THE KING CONSENTED AND THEY WALKED DOWN THE HILL TOWARD THE CITY
5929-57805-0021 HOW DID THE KING GET HIS SENTIMENTS MINGLED ASKED THE KING I REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW IT BEGAN SAID THE SPHINX BUT THE KING WHEN A YOUNG MAN HAD SO MANY SENTIMENTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS
5929-57805-0022 AND HE MINGLED THEM UP SO MUCH THAT NO ONE COULD EVER TELL EXACTLY WHAT HE THOUGHT ON ANY PARTICULAR SUBJECT OF COURSE HIS PEOPLE GRADUALLY GOT INTO THE SAME FRAME OF MIND
5929-57805-0023 EXACTLY WHAT PEOPLE THINK OR WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO
5929-57805-0024 I MYSELF CAME INTO THESE PARTS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE EVERY NOW AND THEN TAKE A GREAT FANCY TO PUZZLES AND RIDDLES ON ENTERING THE CITY THE KING WAS CORDIALLY WELCOMED BY HIS BROTHER SOVEREIGN TO WHOM HE TOLD HIS STORY
5929-57805-0025 AND HE WAS LODGED IN A ROOM IN THE PALACE SUCH OF HIS FOLLOWERS AS CAME WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE CITY WERE ENTERTAINED BY THE PERSONS NEAR TO WHOSE HOUSES THEY FOUND THEMSELVES WHEN THE LINE HALTED EVERY DAY THE SPHINX WENT WITH HIM TO SEE THE SIGHTS OF THIS STRANGE CITY
5929-57805-0026 THEY TOOK LONG WALKS THROUGH THE STREETS AND SOMETIMES INTO THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY ALWAYS GOING ONE WAY AND RETURNING ANOTHER THE SPHINX BEING VERY CAREFUL NEVER TO BRING THE KING BACK BY THE SAME ROAD OR STREET BY WHICH THEY WENT
5929-57805-0027 IN THIS WAY THE KING'S LINE OF FOLLOWERS WHICH OF COURSE LENGTHENED OUT EVERY TIME HE TOOK A WALK CAME TO BE ARRANGED IN LONG LOOPS THROUGH MANY PARTS OF THE CITY AND SUBURBS MANY OF THE THINGS THE KING SAW SHOWED PLAINLY THE MINGLED SENTIMENTS OF THE PEOPLE
5929-57805-0028 FOR INSTANCE HE WOULD ONE DAY VISIT A GREAT SMITH'S SHOP WHERE HEAVY MASSES OF IRON WERE BEING FORGED THE WHOLE PLACE RESOUNDING WITH TREMENDOUS BLOWS FROM HEAVY HAMMERS AND THE CLANK AND DIN OF IRON ON THE ANVILS
5929-57805-0029 THE KING OF THE COUNTRY IN HIS TREATMENT OF HIS VISITOR SHOWED HIS PECULIAR NATURE VERY PLAINLY SOMETIMES HE WOULD RECEIVE HIM WITH ENTHUSIASTIC DELIGHT WHILE AT OTHERS HE WOULD UPBRAID HIM WITH HAVING LEFT HIS DOMINIONS TO GO WANDERING AROUND THE EARTH IN THIS SENSELESS WAY
5929-57805-0030 ONE DAY HIS HOST INVITED HIM TO ATTEND A ROYAL DINNER BUT WHEN HE WENT TO THE GRAND DINING HALL PLEASED WITH ANTICIPATIONS OF A SPLENDID FEAST HE FOUND THAT THE SENTIMENTS OF HIS MAJESTY HAD BECOME MINGLED AND THAT HE HAD DETERMINED INSTEAD OF HAVING A DINNER
5929-57805-0031 TO CONDUCT THE FUNERAL SERVICES OF ONE OF HIS SERVANTS WHO HAD DIED THE DAY BEFORE
5929-57805-0032 WHICH OUR KING NOT HAVING BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH THE DECEASED SERVANT
5929-57805-0033 NOW SAID THE KING TO THE SPHINX I AM IN FAVOR OF MOVING ON
5929-57805-0034 I DON'T BELIEVE ANY ONE IN THIS COUNTRY WAS EVER TRULY GLAD OR SORRY THEY MIX ONE SENTIMENT SO QUICKLY WITH ANOTHER
5929-57805-0035 IT WAS BECAUSE HE ALWAYS DESIRED TO THINK AND FEEL EXACTLY RIGHT HE DID NOT WISH HIS FEELINGS TO RUN TOO MUCH ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AND SO HE IS NEVER EITHER RIGHT OR WRONG SAID THE KING
5929-57805-0036 I HAVE WASTED A GOOD DEAL OF TIME AT THIS PLACE REMARKED THE KING AS THEY WALKED ON AND I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD NOTHING WHICH I WISH TO TEACH MY PEOPLE BUT I MUST FIND OUT SOME WAY TO PREVENT EVERY THING GOING WRONG IN MY KINGDOM
5929-57805-0037 AND SOMETIMES TWO OR THREE TOGETHER AND HAVE KEPT THIS UP YEAR AFTER YEAR
5929-57805-0038 THAT I HAVE SENT A GOOD MANY COMMUNICATIONS TO MY QUEEN BUT HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANY FROM HER SO I DO NOT KNOW HOW THINGS ARE GOING ON IN MY KINGDOM THEY THEN TRAVELLED ON THE LONG LINE OF FOLLOWERS COMING AFTER
5929-57805-0039 KEEPING THEIR RELATIVE POSITIONS A HUNDRED YARDS APART AND PASSING OVER ALL THE GROUND THE KING HAD TRAVERSED IN HIS CIRCUITOUS WALKS ABOUT THE CITY THUS THE LINE CREPT ALONG LIKE AN ENORMOUS SNAKE IN STRAIGHT LINES LOOPS AND COILS
5929-57805-0040 AND EVERY TIME THE KING WALKED A HUNDRED YARDS A FRESH MAN FROM HIS CAPITAL CITY
5929-57805-0041 IF YOU WANT TO SEE A KINGDOM WHERE THERE REALLY IS SOMETHING TO LEARN YOU OUGHT TO GO TO THE COUNTRY OF THE GAUMERS WHICH WE ARE NOW APPROACHING ALL RIGHT SAID THE KING LET US GO THERE
5929-57805-0042 IN THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON THEY REACHED THE EDGE OF A HIGH BLUFF ON THE LEVEL GROUND BENEATH THIS PRECIPICE SAID THE SPHINX IS THE COUNTRY OF THE DWARFS CALLED GAUMERS
5929-57805-0043 THE KING AND THE SPHINX THEN SAT DOWN AND LOOKED OUT FROM THE EDGE OVER THE COUNTRY OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE THE OFFICER OF THE COURT WHO HAD FORMED THE HEAD OF THE LINE WISHED VERY MUCH TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT BUT WHEN THE LINE HALTED HE WAS NOT NEAR ENOUGH
5929-57805-0044 YOU WILL NOTICE SAID THE SPHINX THAT THE LITTLE HOUSES AND HUTS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER IN CLUSTERS EACH ONE OF THESE CLUSTERS IS UNDER A SEPARATE KING WHY DON'T THEY ALL LIVE UNDER ONE RULER ASKED THE KING THAT IS THE PROPER WAY
5929-57805-0045 THEY DO NOT THINK SO SAID THE SPHINX IN EACH OF THESE CLUSTERS LIVE THE GAUMERS WHO ARE BEST SUITED TO EACH OTHER AND IF ANY GAUMER FINDS HE CANNOT GET ALONG IN ONE CLUSTER HE GOES TO ANOTHER
5929-57805-0046 THE KINGS ARE CHOSEN FROM AMONG THE VERY BEST OF THEM AND EACH ONE IS ALWAYS VERY ANXIOUS TO PLEASE HIS SUBJECTS HE KNOWS THAT EVERY THING THAT HE AND HIS QUEEN AND HIS CHILDREN EAT OR DRINK OR WEAR
5929-57805-0047 AND IF IT WERE NOT FOR THEM HE COULD NOT BE THEIR RULER
5929-57805-0048 FOR HE KNOWS IF HE DOES NOT PLEASE THEM AND GOVERN THEM WELL THEY WILL GRADUALLY DROP OFF FROM HIM AND GO TO OTHER CLUSTERS
5929-57805-0049 OR ANY KINGDOM THAT IS A VERY QUEER WAY OF RULING SAID THE KING I THINK THE PEOPLE OUGHT TO TRY TO PLEASE THEIR SOVEREIGN HE IS ONLY ONE AND THEY ARE A GREAT MANY SAID THE SPHINX CONSEQUENTLY
5929-57805-0050 THEY ARE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT NO SUBJECT IS EVER ALLOWED TO LOOK DOWN UPON A KING SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HELPS TO FEED AND CLOTHE HIM AND SEND HIS CHILDREN TO SCHOOL IF ANY ONE DOES A THING OF THIS KIND HE IS BANISHED UNTIL HE LEARNS BETTER
5929-57805-0051 ALL THAT MAY BE VERY WELL FOR GAUMERS SAID THE KING BUT I CAN LEARN NOTHING FROM A GOVERNMENT LIKE THAT
5929-57805-0052 FROM WHAT EVERYBODY KNOWS IS RIGHT AND PROPER A KING ANXIOUS TO DESERVE THE GOOD OPINION OF HIS SUBJECTS WHAT NONSENSE IT OUGHT TO BE JUST THE OTHER WAY THE IDEAS OF THIS PEOPLE ARE AS DWARFISH AS THEIR BODIES THE KING NOW AROSE AND TOOK UP THE LINE OF MARCH
5929-57805-0053 TURNING AWAY FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE GAUMERS BUT HE HAD NOT GONE MORE THAN TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YARDS BEFORE HE RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM THE QUEEN IT CAME TO HIM VERY RAPIDLY EVERY MAN IN THE LINE SEEMING ANXIOUS TO SHOUT IT TO THE MAN AHEAD OF HIM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
5929-57805-0054 THE MESSAGE WAS TO THE EFFECT THAT HE MUST EITHER STOP WHERE HE WAS OR COME HOME HIS CONSTANTLY LENGTHENING LINE OF COMMUNICATION HAD USED UP ALL THE CHIEF OFFICERS OF THE GOVERNMENT ALL THE CLERKS IN THE DEPARTMENTS AND ALL THE OFFICIALS OF EVERY GRADE
5929-57805-0055 AND IF ANY MORE MEN WENT INTO THE LINE IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO CALL UPON THE LABORERS AND OTHER PERSONS WHO COULD NOT BE SPARED I THINK SAID THE SPHINX THAT YOU HAVE MADE YOUR LINE LONG ENOUGH AND I THINK SAID THE KING
5929-57805-0056 THAT YOU MADE IT A GREAT DEAL LONGER THAN IT NEED TO HAVE BEEN BY TAKING ME ABOUT IN SUCH WINDING WAYS IT MAY BE SO SAID THE SPHINX WITH ITS MYSTIC SMILE WELL I AM NOT GOING TO STOP HERE SAID THE KING
5929-57805-0057 AND SO I MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK AS SOON AS I CAN AND HE SHOUTED TO THE HEAD MAN OF THE LINE TO PASS ON THE ORDER THAT HIS EDICT OF BANISHMENT BE REVOKED IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE NEWS CAME THAT THE EDICT WAS REVOKED
5929-57805-0058 THE KING THEN COMMANDED THAT THE PROCESSION RETURN HOME TAIL END FOREMOST THE MARCH WAS AT ONCE BEGUN EACH MAN AS HE REACHED THE CITY GOING IMMEDIATELY TO HIS HOME AND FAMILY THE KING AND THE GREATER PART OF THE LINE HAD A LONG AND WEARY JOURNEY
5929-57805-0059 AS THEY FOLLOWED EACH OTHER THROUGH THE COUNTRY AND OVER THE DEVIOUS WAYS IN WHICH THE SPHINX HAD LED THEM IN THE CITY OF MINGLED SENTIMENTS THE KING WAS OBLIGED TO PURSUE ALL THESE COMPLICATED TURNINGS OR BE SEPARATED FROM HIS OFFICERS
5929-57805-0060 AND SO BREAK UP HIS COMMUNICATION WITH HIS PALACE THE SPHINX ACCOMPANIED HIM WHEN AT LAST HE REACHED HIS PALACE HIS LINE OF FORMER FOLLOWERS HAVING APPARENTLY MELTED ENTIRELY AWAY HE HURRIED UP STAIRS TO THE QUEEN LEAVING THE SPHINX IN THE COURT YARD
5929-57805-0061 THE KING FOUND WHEN HE HAD TIME TO LOOK INTO THE AFFAIRS OF HIS DOMINIONS THAT EVERY THING WAS IN THE MOST ADMIRABLE CONDITION THE QUEEN HAD RETAINED A FEW OF THE BEST OFFICIALS TO CARRY ON THE GOVERNMENT AND HAD ORDERED THE REST TO FALL ONE BY ONE INTO THE LINE OF COMMUNICATION
5929-57805-0062 THE KING SET HIMSELF TO WORK TO THINK ABOUT THE MATTER IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE MAIN THING WHICH HAD BEEN WRONG IN HIS KINGDOM WAS HIMSELF HE WAS SO GREATLY IMPRESSED WITH THIS IDEA
5929-57805-0063 THAT HE WENT DOWN TO THE COURT YARD TO SPEAK TO THE SPHINX ABOUT IT I DARE SAY YOU ARE RIGHT SAID THE SPHINX AND I DON'T WONDER THAT WHAT YOU LEARNED WHEN YOU WERE AWAY AND WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN SINCE YOU CAME BACK HAVE MADE YOU FEEL CERTAIN
5929-57805-0064 THAT YOU WERE THE CAUSE OF EVERY THING GOING WRONG IN THIS KINGDOM AND NOW WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO ABOUT YOUR GOVERNMENT GIVE IT UP PROMPTLY REPLIED THE KING THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD ADVISE SAID THE SPHINX
5929-57805-0065 THE KING DID GIVE UP HIS KINGDOM HE WAS CONVINCED THAT BEING A KING WAS EXACTLY THE THING HE WAS NOT SUITED FOR AND THAT HE WOULD GET ON MUCH BETTER IN SOME OTHER BUSINESS OR PROFESSION HE DETERMINED TO BE A TRAVELLER AND EXPLORER AND TO GO ABROAD INTO OTHER COUNTRIES
5929-57805-0066 TO FIND OUT THINGS THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO HIS OWN NATION HIS QUEEN HAD SHOWN THAT SHE COULD GOVERN THE COUNTRY MOST EXCELLENTLY AND IT WAS NOT AT ALL NECESSARY FOR HIM TO STAY AT HOME SHE HAD ORDERED ALL THE MEN WHO HAD MADE UP HIS LINE TO FOLLOW THE KING'S EXAMPLE
5929-57805-0067 IN ORDER THAT NOT BEING BOTHERED WITH SO MANY OFFICERS SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET ALONG QUITE EASILY THE KING WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL IN HIS NEW PURSUIT AND ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT THIS TIME HAVE A LINE OF FOLLOWERS CONNECTING HIM WITH THE PALACE HE FREQUENTLY SENT HOME MESSAGES
5929-57805-0068 WHICH WERE OF USE AND VALUE TO HIS NATION
