7392-94500-0000 SHOULD CHOOSE FORTY COMMISSIONERS BRUCE AND HIS ADHERENTS FORTY MORE TO THESE THE KING ADDED TWENTY FOUR ENGLISHMEN
7392-94500-0001 AND MAKE THEIR REPORT TO HIM AND HE PROMISED IN THE ENSUING YEAR TO GIVE HIS DETERMINATION MEANWHILE HE PRETENDED THAT IT WAS REQUISITE TO HAVE ALL THE FORTRESSES OF SCOTLAND DELIVERED INTO HIS HANDS IN ORDER TO ENABLE HIM WITHOUT OPPOSITION TO PUT THE TRUE HEIR IN POSSESSION OF THE CROWN
7392-94500-0002 AND THIS EXORBITANT DEMAND WAS COMPLIED WITH BOTH BY THE STATES AND BY THE CLAIMANTS THE GOVERNORS ALSO OF ALL THE CASTLES IMMEDIATELY RESIGNED THEIR COMMAND EXCEPT UMFREVILLE
7392-94500-0003 EARL OF ANGUS WHO REFUSED WITHOUT A FORMAL AND PARTICULAR ACQUITTAL FROM THE PARLIAMENT AND THE SEVERAL CLAIMANTS TO SURRENDER HIS FORTRESSES TO SO DOMINEERING AN ARBITER WHO HAD GIVEN TO SCOTLAND SO MANY JUST REASONS OF SUSPICION
7392-94500-0004 BEFORE THIS ASSEMBLY BROKE UP WHICH HAD FIXED SUCH A MARK OF DISHONOR ON THE NATION
7392-94500-0005 BOTH IN ORDER TO ASSIST AT THE FUNERAL OF HIS MOTHER QUEEN ELEANOR WHO DIED ABOUT THIS TIME AND TO COMPOSE SOME DIFFERENCES WHICH HAD ARISEN AMONG HIS PRINCIPAL NOBILITY GILBERT EARL OF GLOCESTER THE GREATEST BARON OF THE KINGDOM HAD ESPOUSED THE KING'S DAUGHTER
7392-94500-0006 AND BEING ELATED BY THAT ALLIANCE AND STILL MORE BY HIS OWN POWER WHICH HE THOUGHT SET HIM ABOVE THE LAWS HE PERMITTED HIS BAILIFFS AND VASSALS TO COMMIT VIOLENCE ON THE LANDS OF HUMPHREY BOHUN EARL OF HEREFORD WHO RETALIATED THE INJURY BY LIKE VIOLENCE
7392-94500-0007 BUT THIS WAS NOT A REIGN IN WHICH SUCH ILLEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD PASS WITH IMPUNITY EDWARD PROCURED A SENTENCE AGAINST THE TWO EARLS COMMITTED THEM BOTH TO PRISON AND WOULD NOT RESTORE THEM TO THEIR LIBERTY TILL HE HAD EXACTED A FINE OF ONE THOUSAND MARKS FROM HEREFORD
7392-94500-0008 WHOSE CLAIMS APPEARED TO BE THE BEST FOUNDED AMONG THE COMPETITORS FOR THE CROWN OF SCOTLAND WERE THE SUBJECT OF GENERAL DISQUISITION AS WELL AS OF DEBATE AMONG THE COMMISSIONERS EDWARD IN ORDER TO GIVE GREATER AUTHORITY TO HIS INTENDED DECISION
7392-94500-0009 THIS WAS THE TRUE STATE OF THE CASE AND THE PRINCIPLE OF REPRESENTATION HAD NOW GAINED SUCH GROUND EVERY WHERE THAT A UNIFORM ANSWER WAS RETURNED TO THE KING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE HE THEREFORE PRONOUNCED SENTENCE IN FAVOR OF BALIOI
7392-94500-0010 AND WHEN BRUCE UPON THIS DISAPPOINTMENT JOINED AFTERWARDS LORD HASTINGS AND CLAIMED A THIRD OF THE KINGDOM WHICH HE NOW PRETENDED TO BE DIVISIBLE EDWARD THOUGH HIS INTERESTS SEEMED MORE TO REQUIRE THE PARTITION OF SCOTLAND
7392-94500-0011 AGAIN PRONOUNCED SENTENCE IN FAVOR OF BALIOL THAT COMPETITOR UPON RENEWING HIS OATH OF FEALTY TO ENGLAND WAS PUT IN POSSESSION OF THE KINGDOM ALL HIS FORTRESSES WERE RESTORED TO HIM AND THE CONDUCT OF EDWARD BOTH IN THE DELIBERATE SOLEMNITY OF THE PROCEEDINGS
7392-94500-0012 AND IN THE JUSTICE OF THE AWARD WAS SO FAR UNEXCEPTIONABLE
7392-94500-0013 THOUGH THE INIQUITY OF THAT CLAIM WAS APPARENT AND WAS AGGRAVATED BY THE MOST EGREGIOUS BREACH OF TRUST HE MIGHT HAVE FIXED HIS PRETENSIONS
7392-94500-0014 BUT HE IMMEDIATELY PROCEEDED IN SUCH A MANNER AS MADE IT EVIDENT THAT NOT CONTENT WITH THIS USURPATION
7392-94500-0015 TO ENGAGE HIM IN REBELLION AND TO ASSUME THE DOMINION OF THE STATE AS THE PUNISHMENT OF HIS TREASON AND FELONY ACCORDINGLY BALIOL THOUGH A PRINCE OF A SOFT AND GENTLE SPIRIT RETURNED INTO SCOTLAND HIGHLY PROVOKED AT THIS USAGE
7392-94500-0016 AND DETERMINED AT ALL HAZARDS TO VINDICATE HIS LIBERTY AND THE WAR WHICH SOON AFTER BROKE OUT BETWEEN FRANCE AND ENGLAND GAVE HIM A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY OF EXECUTING HIS PURPOSE THE VIOLENCE ROBBERIES AND DISORDERS TO WHICH THAT AGE WAS SO SUBJECT
7392-94500-0017 WERE NOT CONFINED TO THE LICENTIOUS BARONS AND THEIR RETAINERS AT LAND THE SEA WAS EQUALLY INFESTED WITH PIRACY THE FEEBLE EXECUTION OF THE LAWS HAD GIVEN LICENSE TO ALL ORDERS OF MEN
7392-94500-0018 AND BOTH OF THEM HAVING OCCASION FOR WATER THEY SENT THEIR BOATS TO LAND AND THE SEVERAL CREWS CAME AT THE SAME TIME TO THE SAME SPRING THERE ENSUED A QUARREL FOR THE PREFERENCE A NORMAN DRAWING HIS DAGGER ATTEMPTED TO STAB AN ENGLISHMAN
7392-94500-0019 WHO GRAPPLING WITH HIM THREW HIS ADVERSARY ON THE GROUND AND THE NORMAN AS WAS PRETENDED FALLING ON HIS OWN DAGGER
7392-94500-0020 WHO WITHOUT CARRYING ANY COMPLAINT TO THE KING OR WAITING FOR REDRESS RETALIATED BY COMMITTING LIKE BARBARITIES ON ALL FRENCH VESSELS WITHOUT DISTINCTION THE FRENCH PROVOKED BY THEIR LOSSES PREYED ON THE SHIPS OF ALL EDWARD'S SUBJECTS WHETHER ENGLISH OR GASCON
7392-94500-0021 THE SEA BECAME A SCENE OF PIRACY BETWEEN THE NATIONS THE SOVEREIGNS WITHOUT EITHER SECONDING OR REPRESSING THE VIOLENCE OF THEIR SUBJECTS SEEMED TO REMAIN INDIFFERENT SPECTATORS THE ENGLISH MADE PRIVATE ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE IRISH AND DUTCH SEAMEN
7392-94500-0022 AND THE ANIMOSITIES OF THE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES BECAME EVERY DAY MORE VIOLENT AND BARBAROUS A FLEET OF TWO HUNDRED NORMAN VESSELS SET SAIL TO THE SOUTH FOR WINE AND OTHER COMMODITIES AND IN THEIR PASSAGE SEIZED ALL THE ENGLISH SHIPS WHICH THEY MET WITH
7392-94500-0023 HANGED THE SEAMEN AND SEIZED THE GOODS THE INHABITANTS OF THE ENGLISH SEAPORTS INFORMED OF THIS INCIDENT FITTED OUT A FLEET OF SIXTY SAIL STRONGER AND BETTER MANNED THAN THE OTHERS AND AWAITED THE ENEMY ON THEIR RETURN AFTER AN OBSTINATE BATTLE
7392-94500-0024 THAT THE NORMAN FLEET WAS EMPLOYED IN TRANSPORTING A CONSIDERABLE BODY OF SOLDIERS FROM THE SOUTH THE AFFAIR WAS NOW BECOME TOO IMPORTANT TO BE ANY LONGER OVERLOOKED BY THE SOVEREIGNS ON PHILIP'S SENDING AN ENVOY TO DEMAND REPARATION AND RESTITUTION
7392-94500-0025 THE KING DESPATCHED HIS BROTHER EDMOND EARL OF LANCASTER TO PARIS AND AS THIS PRINCE HAD ESPOUSED THE QUEEN OF NAVARRE MOTHER TO JANE QUEEN OF FRANCE HE SEEMED ON ACCOUNT OF THAT ALLIANCE THE MOST PROPER PERSON FOR FINDING EXPEDIENTS TO ACCOMMODATE THE DIFFERENCE
7392-94500-0026 JANE PRETENDED TO INTERPOSE WITH HER GOOD OFFICES MARY THE QUEEN DOWAGER FEIGNED THE SAME AMICABLE DISPOSITION AND THESE TWO PRINCESSES TOLD EDMOND THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE THE MOST DIFFICULT TO ADJUST WAS THE POINT OF HONOR WITH PHILIP
7392-94500-0027 WHO THOUGHT HIMSELF AFFRONTED BY THE INJURIES COMMITTED AGAINST HIM BY HIS SUB VASSALS IN GUIENNE BUT IF EDWARD WOULD ONCE CONSENT TO GIVE HIM SEIZIN AND POSSESSION OF THAT PROVINCE HE WOULD THINK HIS HONOR FULLY REPAIRED WOULD ENGAGE TO RESTORE GUIENNE IMMEDIATELY
7392-94500-0028 AND WOULD ACCEPT OF A VERY EASY SATISFACTION FOR ALL THE OTHER INJURIES THE KING WAS CONSULTED ON THE OCCASION AND AS HE THEN FOUND HIMSELF IN IMMEDIATE DANGER OF WAR WITH THE SCOTS WHICH HE REGARDED AS THE MORE IMPORTANT CONCERN
7392-94500-0029 ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE DECEIVED BY SO GROSS AN ARTIFICE HE SENT HIS BROTHER ORDERS TO SIGN AND EXECUTE THE TREATY WITH THE TWO QUEENS PHILIP SOLEMNLY PROMISED TO EXECUTE HIS PART OF IT
7392-94500-0030 AND THE KING'S CITATION TO APPEAR IN THE COURT OF FRANCE WAS ACCORDINGLY RECALLED BUT THE FRENCH MONARCH WAS NO SOONER PUT IN POSSESSION OF GUIENNE THAN THE CITATION WAS RENEWED
7392-94500-0031 IN BEING SO EGREGIOUSLY OVERREACHED BY THE COURT OF FRANCE SENSIBLE OF THE EXTREME DIFFICULTIES WHICH HE SHOULD ENCOUNTER IN THE RECOVERY OF GASCONY WHERE HE HAD NOT RETAINED A SINGLE PLACE IN HIS HANDS
7392-94500-0032 HE ENDEAVORED TO COMPENSATE THAT LOSS BY FORMING ALLIANCES WITH SEVERAL PRINCES WHO HE PROJECTED SHOULD ATTACK FRANCE ON ALL QUARTERS AND MAKE A DIVERSION OF HER FORCES ADOLPHUS DE NASSAU KING OF THE ROMANS
7392-94500-0033 ENTERED INTO A TREATY WITH HIM FOR THAT PURPOSE AS DID ALSO AMADAEUS COUNT OF SAVOY THE ARCHBISHOP OF COLOGNE
7392-94500-0034 WHICH HE COMPLETED BY EMPTYING THE JAILS OF MANY THOUSAND THIEVES AND ROBBERS WHO HAD BEEN CONFINED THERE FOR THEIR CRIMES SO LOW HAD THE PROFESSION OF ARMS FALLEN
7392-94500-0035 AND UNDER HIM BY SAINT JOHN
7392-94500-0036 CHARLES DE VALOIS WHO COMMANDED THE FRENCH ARMIES HAVING LAID SIEGE TO PODENSAC A SMALL FORTRESS NEAR REOLE
7392-94500-0037 THE GOVERNOR TO CAPITULATE AND THE ARTICLES THOUGH FAVORABLE TO THE ENGLISH LEFT ALL THE GASCONS PRISONERS AT DISCRETION OF WHOM ABOUT FIFTY WERE HANGED BY CHARLES AS REBELS A POLICY BY WHICH HE BOTH INTIMIDATED THAT PEOPLE
7392-94500-0038 AND PRODUCED AN IRREPARABLE BREACH BETWEEN THEM AND THE ENGLISH THAT PRINCE IMMEDIATELY ATTACKED REOLE WHERE THE EARL OF RICHMOND HIMSELF COMMANDED AND AS THE PLACE SEEMED NOT TENABLE THE ENGLISH GENERAL DREW HIS TROOPS TO THE WATER SIDE
7392-94500-0039 WITH AN INTENTION OF EMBARKING WITH THE GREATER PART OF THE ARMY THE ENRAGED GASCONS FELL UPON HIS REAR AND AT THE SAME TIME OPENED THEIR GATES TO THE FRENCH WHO BESIDES MAKING THEMSELVES MASTERS OF THE PLACE TOOK MANY PRISONERS OF DISTINCTION
7392-94500-0040 SAINT SEVERE WAS MORE VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED BY HUGH DE VERE
7392-94500-0041 BUT WAS AT LAST OBLIGED TO CAPITULATE THE FRENCH KING NOT CONTENT WITH THESE SUCCESSES IN GASCONY THREATENED ENGLAND WITH AN INVASION AND BY A SUDDEN ATTEMPT HIS TROOPS TOOK AND BURNT DOVER BUT WERE OBLIGED SOON AFTER TO RETIRE
7392-94500-0042 INTRODUCED THE LOWER ORDERS OF THE STATE INTO THE PUBLIC COUNCILS AND LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF GREAT AND IMPORTANT CHANGES IN THE GOVERNMENT THOUGH NOTHING COULD BE WORSE CALCULATED FOR CULTIVATING THE ARTS OF PEACE OR MAINTAINING PEACE ITSELF
7392-94500-0043 THAN THE LONG SUBORDINATION OF VASSALAGE FROM THE KING TO THE MEANEST GENTLEMAN AND THE CONSEQUENT SLAVERY OF THE LOWER PEOPLE EVILS INSEPARABLE FROM THE FEUDAL SYSTEM THAT SYSTEM WAS NEVER ABLE TO FIX THE STATE IN A PROPER WARLIKE POSTURE
7392-94500-0044 OR GIVE IT THE FULL EXERTION OF ITS POWER FOR DEFENCE AND STILL LESS FOR OFFENCE AGAINST A PUBLIC ENEMY THE MILITARY TENANTS UNACQUAINTED WITH OBEDIENCE UNEXPERIENCED IN WAR HELD A RANK IN THE TROOPS BY THEIR BIRTH
7392-94500-0045 WHOM THEY DISMISSED AT THE END OF THE WAR THE BARONS AND KNIGHTS THEMSELVES OFTEN ENTERED INTO THESE ENGAGEMENTS WITH THE PRINCE AND WERE ENABLED TO FILL THEIR BANDS BOTH BY THE AUTHORITY WHICH THEY POSSESSED OVER THEIR VASSALS AND TENANTS
7392-94500-0046 AND FROM THE GREAT NUMBERS OF LOOSE DISORDERLY PEOPLE WHOM THEY FOUND ON THEIR ESTATES
7392-94500-0047 MEANWHILE THE OLD GOTHIC FABRIC BEING NEGLECTED WENT GRADUALLY TO DECAY THOUGH THE CONQUEROR HAD DIVIDED ALL THE LANDS OF ENGLAND INTO SIXTY THOUSAND KNIGHTS FEES THE NUMBER OF THESE WAS INSENSIBLY DIMINISHED BY VARIOUS ARTIFICES
7392-94500-0048 AND THE KING AT LAST FOUND THAT BY PUTTING THE LAW IN EXECUTION HE COULD ASSEMBLE A SMALL PART ONLY OF THE ANCIENT FORCE OF THE KINGDOM IT WAS A USUAL EXPEDIENT FOR MEN WHO HELD OF THE KING OR GREAT BARONS BY MILITARY TENURE TO TRANSFER THEIR LAND TO THE CHURCH
7392-94500-0049 AND RECEIVE IT BACK BY ANOTHER TENURE CALLED FRANKALMOIGNE BY WHICH THEY WERE NOT BOUND TO PER FORM ANY SERVICE A LAW WAS MADE AGAINST THIS PRACTICE BUT THE ABUSE HAD PROBABLY GONE FAR BEFORE IT WAS ATTENDED TO
7392-94500-0050 AND PROBABLY WAS NOT ENTIRELY CORRECTED BY THE NEW STATUTE WHICH LIKE MOST LAWS OF THAT AGE WE MAY CONJECTURE TO HAVE BEEN BUT FEEBLY EXECUTED BY THE MAGISTRATE AGAINST THE PERPETUAL INTEREST OF SO MANY INDIVIDUALS
7392-94500-0051 THE CONSTABLE AND MARESCHAL WHEN THEY MUSTERED THE ARMIES OFTEN IN A HURRY AND FOR WANT OF BETTER INFORMATION
7392-94500-0052 IT WAS THEN TOO LATE TO THINK OF EXAMINING RECORDS AND CHARTERS AND THE SERVICE WAS ACCEPTED ON THE FOOTING WHICH THE VASSAL HIMSELF WAS PLEASED TO ACKNOWLEDGE AFTER ALL THE VARIOUS SUBDIVISIONS AND CONJUNCTIONS OF PROPERTY HAD THROWN AN OBSCURITY ON THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF HIS TENURE
7392-94500-0053 IT IS EASY TO JUDGE OF THE INTRICACIES WHICH WOULD ATTEND DISPUTES OF THIS KIND WITH INDIVIDUALS WHEN EVEN THE NUMBER OF MILITARY FEES BELONGING TO THE CHURCH WHOSE PROPERTY WAY FIXED AND UNALIENABLE BECAME THE SUBJECT OF CONTROVERSY
7392-94500-0054 AND WE FIND IN PARTICULAR THAT WHEN THE BISHOP OF DURHAM WAS CHARGED WITH SEVENTY KNIGHTS FEES
7392-94500-0055 AND THIS RATE MUST ALSO HAVE FIXED ALL HIS FUTURE PAYMENTS PECUNIARY SCUTAGES THEREFORE
7392-94500-0056 OTHER METHODS OF FILLING THE EXCHEQUER AS WELL AS THE ARMIES MUST BE DEVISED
