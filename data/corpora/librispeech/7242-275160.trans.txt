7242-275160-0000 SHE TRIED TO THINK OF BENNYDECK HER EYES FOLLOWED HIM AS LONG AS HE WAS IN SIGHT BUT HER THOUGHTS WANDERED TO LOOK AT HIM NOW WAS TO LOOK AT THE LITTLE COMPANION WALKING BY HIS SIDE STILL
7242-275160-0001 THE CHILD REMINDED HER OF THE LIVING FATHER STILL THE CHILD INNOCENTLY TORTURED HER WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF DECEIT THE FAITHLESS MAN FROM WHOM THE LAW HAD RELEASED HER
7242-275160-0002 POSSESSED HIMSELF OF HER THOUGHTS IN SPITE OF THE LAW HE AND HE ONLY
7242-275160-0003 WHEN SHE WAS LEFT BY HERSELF DID HE REMIND HER OF THE SIN THAT HE HAD COMMITTED OF THE INSULT THAT HE HAD INFLICTED ON THE WOMAN WHOM HE HAD VOWED TO LOVE AND CHERISH NO

7242-275160-0012 THE CHANCES AND CHANGES OF LIFE SHOW THE CHILD'S MOBILITY OF EMOTION CONSTANTLY ASSOCIATING ITSELF WITH THE PASSIONS OF THE WOMAN
7242-275160-0013 AT THE MOMENT OF RECOGNITION THE TROUBLED MIND OF CATHERINE WAS INSTANTLY STEADIED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THAT COARSEST SENSE WHICH LEVELS US WITH THE ANIMALS THE SENSE OF ANGER
7242-275160-0014 I AM AMAZED AT YOUR AUDACITY SHE SAID THERE WAS NO RESENTMENT THERE WAS ONLY PATIENT SUBMISSION IN SYDNEY'S REPLY TWICE I HAVE APPROACHED THE HOUSE IN WHICH YOU ARE LIVING AND TWICE MY COURAGE HAS FAILED ME

7242-275160-0027 IF I HAD NOT LEFT HIM OF MY OWN FREE WILL SHE SAID WHAT ELSE WOULD EXCUSE ME FOR VENTURING TO COME HERE CATHERINE'S SENSE OF JUSTICE FELT THE FORCE OF THAT REPLY AT THE SAME TIME HER SENSE OF INJURY

7242-275160-0035 CATHERINE'S HEAD SANK ON HER BOSOM HER HELPLESS HANDS LAY TREMBLING ON HER LAP OVERPOWERED BY THE CONFESSION WHICH SHE HAD JUST HEARD
7242-275160-0036 A CONFESSION WHICH HAD FOLLOWED CLOSELY ON THE THOUGHTS INSPIRED BY THE APPEARANCE OF THE CHILD HER AGITATION WAS BEYOND CONTROL HER MIND WAS UNEQUAL TO THE EFFORT OF DECISION
7242-275160-0037 THE WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN WRONGED WHO HAD THE RIGHT TO JUDGE FOR HERSELF AND TO SPEAK FOR HERSELF WAS THE SILENT WOMAN OF THE TWO IT WAS NOT QUITE DARK YET SYDNEY COULD SEE AS WELL AS HEAR
7242-275160-0038 FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE INTERVIEW SHE ALLOWED THE IMPULSE OF THE MOMENT TO LEAD HER ASTRAY IN HER EAGERNESS TO COMPLETE THE ACT OF ATONEMENT
7242-275160-0039 SHE ALLUDED AGAIN TO HERBERT LINLEY AND SHE SPOKE TOO SOON WILL YOU LET HIM ASK YOUR PARDON SHE SAID HE EXPECTS NO MORE

7242-275160-0045 DOES YOUR REPENTANCE FORGET THAT HE WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN MY BLAMELESS HUSBAND BUT FOR YOU
7242-275160-0046 CATHERINE LOOKED AT HER AND RELENTED THE NOBLE NATURE WHICH COULD STOOP TO ANGER BUT NEVER SINK TO THE LOWER DEPTHS OF MALICE AND PERSECUTION RESTRAINED ITSELF AND MADE AMENDS
