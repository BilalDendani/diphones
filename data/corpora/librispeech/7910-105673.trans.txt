7910-105673-0000 THE CONCURRENCE OF THESE TWO NATIONAL ASSEMBLIES SERVED NO DOUBT TO INCREASE THE KING'S POWER OVER THE PEOPLE
7910-105673-0001 EVEN BY MEANS OF MILITARY FORCE IS EVER ABLE TO ATTAIN BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN BOUNDS BEYOND WHICH THE MOST SLAVISH SUBMISSION CANNOT BE EXTENDED ALL THE LATE INNOVATIONS PARTICULARLY THE DISSOLUTION OF THE SMALLER MONASTERIES
7910-105673-0002 SUITED TO VULGAR CAPACITY IT WAS ABLE NOW THAT IT WAS BROUGHT INTO APPARENT HAZARD TO RAISE THE STRONGEST ZEAL IN ITS FAVOR
7910-105673-0003 OF INDIVIDUALS EVEN THE MOST MODERATE AND REASONABLE DEEMED IT SOMEWHAT INIQUITOUS THAT MEN WHO HAD BEEN INVITED INTO A COURSE OF LIFE BY ALL THE LAWS HUMAN AND DIVINE WHICH PREVAILED IN THEIR COUNTRY
7910-105673-0004 SHOULD BE TURNED OUT OF THEIR POSSESSIONS AND SO LITTLE CARE BE TAKEN OF THEIR FUTURE SUBSISTENCE
7910-105673-0005 BUT THE PEOPLE DID NOT BREAK INTO OPEN SEDITION TILL THE COMPLAINTS OF THE SECULAR CLERGY CONCURRED WITH THOSE OF THE REGULAR AS CROMWELL'S PERSON WAS LITTLE ACCEPTABLE TO THE ECCLESIASTICS THE AUTHORITY WHICH HE EXERCISED BEING SO NEW SO ABSOLUTE
7910-105673-0006 PROHIBITED SEVERAL SUPERSTITIONS GAINFUL TO THE CLERGY SUCH AS PILGRIMAGES IMAGES RELICS AND EVEN ORDERED THE INCUMBENTS IN THE PARISHES TO SET APART A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THEIR REVENUE FOR REPAIRS
7910-105673-0007 AND FOR THE SUPPORT OF EXHIBITIONERS AND THE POOR OF THEIR PARISH THE SECULAR PRIESTS FINDING THEMSELVES THUS REDUCED TO A GRIEVOUS SERVITUDE INSTILLED INTO THE PEOPLE THOSE DISCONTENTS WHICH THEY HAD LONG HARBORED IN THEIR OWN BOSOMS
7910-105673-0008 THE FIRST RISING WAS IN LINCOLNSHIRE IT WAS HEADED BY DOCTOR MACKREL PRIOR OF BARLINGS WHO WAS DISGUISED LIKE A MEAN MECHANIC AND WHO BORE THE NAME OF CAPTAIN COBLER
7910-105673-0009 AND WHO KEPT A SECRET CORRESPONDENCE WITH SUFFOLK THEY INFORMED HIM THAT RESENTMENT AGAINST THE KING'S REPLY WAS THE CHIEF CAUSE WHICH RETAINED THE MALECONTENTS IN ARMS AND THAT A MILDER ANSWER WOULD PROBABLY SUPPRESS THE REBELLION
7910-105673-0010 HENRY HAD LEVIED A GREAT FORCE AT LONDON WITH WHICH HE WAS PREPARING TO MARCH AGAINST THE REBELS AND BEING SO WELL SUPPORTED BY POWER HE THOUGHT THAT WITHOUT LOSING HIS DIGNITY HE MIGHT NOW SHOW THEM SOME GREATER CONDESCENSION
7910-105673-0011 HE SENT A NEW PROCLAMATION REQUIRING THEM TO RETURN TO THEIR OBEDIENCE WITH SECRET ASSURANCES OF PARDON THIS EXPEDIENT HAD ITS EFFECT THE POPULACE WAS DISPERSED
7910-105673-0012 MACKREL AND SOME OF THEIR LEADERS FELL INTO THE KING'S HANDS AND WERE EXECUTED THE GREATER PART OF THE MULTITUDE RETIRED PEACEABLY TO THEIR USUAL OCCUPATIONS A FEW OF THE MORE OBSTINATE FLED TO THE NORTH WHERE THEY JOINED THE INSURRECTION THAT WAS RAISED IN THOSE PARTS
7910-105673-0013 ONE ASKE A GENTLEMAN HAD TAKEN THE COMMAND OF THEM AND HE POSSESSED THE ART OF GOVERNING THE POPULACE THEIR ENTERPRISE THEY CALLED THE PILGRIMAGE OF GRACE SOME PRIESTS MARCHED BEFORE IN THE HABITS OF THEIR ORDER CARRYING CROSSES IN THEIR HANDS
7910-105673-0014 AND AS HIS ARMY WAS SMALL SCARCELY EXCEEDING FIVE THOUSAND MEN HE MADE CHOICE OF A POST WHERE HE HAD A RIVER IN FRONT THE FORD OF WHICH HE PURPOSED TO DEFEND AGAINST THE REBELS THEY HAD INTENDED TO ATTACK HIM IN THE MORNING
7910-105673-0015 AND HENRY PURPOSELY DELAYED GIVING AN ANSWER AND ALLURED THEM WITH HOPES OF ENTIRE SATISFACTION IN EXPECTATION THAT NECESSITY WOULD SOON OBLIGE THEM TO DISPERSE THEMSELVES BEING INFORMED THAT HIS ARTIFICE HAD IN A GREAT MEASURE SUCCEEDED
7910-105673-0016 HE REQUIRED THEM INSTANTLY TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS AND SUBMIT TO MERCY PROMISING A PARDON TO ALL EXCEPT SIX WHOM HE NAMED AND FOUR WHOM HE RESERVED TO HIMSELF THE POWER OF NAMING
7910-105673-0017 THEY HAD ENTERED INTO THE MOST SOLEMN ENGAGEMENTS TO RETURN TO THEIR STANDARDS IN CASE THE KING'S ANSWER SHOULD NOT PROVE SATISFACTORY NORFOLK THEREFORE SOON FOUND HIMSELF IN THE SAME DIFFICULTY AS BEFORE
7910-105673-0018 AND HE OPENED AGAIN A NEGOTIATION WITH THE LEADERS OF THE MULTITUDE HE ENGAGED THEM TO SEND THREE HUNDRED PERSONS TO DONCASTER WITH PROPOSALS FOR AN ACCOMMODATION AND HE HOPED BY INTRIGUE AND SEPARATE INTERESTS TO THROW DISSENSION AMONG SO GREAT A NUMBER
7910-105673-0019 ASKE HIMSELF HAD INTENDED TO BE ONE OF THE DEPUTIES AND HE REQUIRED A HOSTAGE FOR HIS SECURITY BUT THE KING WHEN CONSULTED REPLIED THAT HE KNEW NO GENTLEMAN OR OTHER WHOM HE ESTEEMED SO LITTLE AS TO PUT HIM IN PLEDGE FOR SUCH A VILLAIN
7910-105673-0020 THE DEMANDS OF THE REBELS WERE SO EXORBITANT THAT NORFOLK REJECTED THEM AND THEY PREPARED AGAIN TO DECIDE THE CONTEST BY ARMS THEY WERE AS FORMIDABLE AS EVER BOTH BY THEIR NUMBERS AND SPIRIT
7910-105673-0021 AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE SMALL RIVER WHICH LAY BETWEEN THEM AND THE ROYAL ARMY NORFOLK HAD GREAT REASON TO DREAD THE EFFECTS OF THEIR FURY BUT WHILE THEY WERE PREPARING TO PASS THE FORD RAIN FELL A SECOND TIME IN SUCH ABUNDANCE
7910-105673-0022 AS MADE IT IMPRACTICABLE FOR THEM TO EXECUTE THEIR DESIGN AND THE POPULACE PARTLY REDUCED TO NECESSITY BY WANT OF PROVISIONS PARTLY STRUCK WITH SUPERSTITION AT BEING THUS AGAIN DISAPPOINTED BY THE SAME ACCIDENT SUDDENLY DISPERSED THEMSELVES
7910-105673-0023 THE DUKE OF NORFOLK WHO HAD RECEIVED POWERS FOR THAT END FORWARDED THE DISPERSION BY THE PROMISE OF A GENERAL AMNESTY AND THE KING RATIFIED THIS ACT OF CLEMENCY HE PUBLISHED HOWEVER A MANIFESTO AGAINST THE REBELS AND AN ANSWER TO THEIR COMPLAINTS
7910-105673-0024 IN WHICH HE EMPLOYED A VERY LOFTY STYLE SUITED TO SO HAUGHTY A MONARCH HE TOLD THEM THAT THEY OUGHT NO MORE TO PRETEND GIVING A JUDGMENT WITH REGARD TO GOVERNMENT THAT A BLIND MAN WITH REGARD TO COLORS
7910-105673-0025 AND WE HE ADDED WITH OUR WHOLE COUNCIL THINK IT RIGHT STRANGE THAT YE WHO BE BUT BRUTES AND INEXPERT FOLK DO TAKE UPON YOU TO APPOINT US WHO BE MEET
7910-105673-0026 EVERY PLACE WAS FULL OF JEALOUSY AND COMPLAINTS A NEW INSURRECTION BROKE OUT HEADED BY MUSGRAVE AND TILBY AND THE REBELS BESIEGED CARLISLE WITH THOUSAND MEN BEING REPULSED BY THAT CITY THEY WERE ENCOUNTERED IN THEIR RETREAT BY NORFOLK WHO PUT THEM TO FLIGHT
7910-105673-0027 AND HAVING MADE PRISONERS OF ALL THEIR OFFICERS EXCEPT MUSGRAVE WHO ESCAPED HE INSTANTLY PUT THEM TO DEATH BY MARTIAL LAW TO THE NUMBER OF SEVENTY PERSONS AN ATTEMPT MADE BY SIR FRANCIS BIGOT AND HALAM TO SURPRISE HULL
7910-105673-0028 MET WITH NO BETTER SUCCESS AND SEVERAL OTHER RISINGS WERE SUPPRESSED BY THE VIGILANCE OF NORFOLK THE KING ENRAGED BY THESE MULTIPLIED REVOLTS WAS DETERMINED NOT TO ADHERE TO THE GENERAL PARDON WHICH HE HAD GRANTED
7910-105673-0029 AND FROM A MOVEMENT OF HIS USUAL VIOLENCE HE MADE THE INNOCENT SUFFER FOR THE GUILTY NORFOLK BY COMMAND FROM HIS MASTER SPREAD THE ROYAL BANNER AND WHEREVER HE THOUGHT PROPER EXECUTED MARTIAL LAW IN THE PUNISHMENT OF OFFENDERS
7910-105673-0030 BESIDES ASKE LEADER OF THE FIRST INSURRECTION SIR ROBERT CONSTABLE SIR JOHN BULMER SIR THOMAS PIERCY SIR STEPHEN HAMILTON NICHOLAS TEMPEST WILLIAM LUMLEY AND MANY OTHERS WERE THROWN INTO PRISON
7910-105673-0031 WAS BEHEADED ON TOWER HILL BEFORE HIS EXECUTION HE ACCUSED NORFOLK OF HAVING SECRETLY ENCOURAGED THE REBELS BUT HENRY EITHER SENSIBLE OF THAT NOBLEMAN'S SERVICES
7910-105673-0032 AND CONVINCED OF HIS FIDELITY OR AFRAID TO OFFEND ONE OF SUCH EXTENSIVE POWER AND GREAT CAPACITY REJECTED THE INFORMATION BEING NOW SATIATED WITH PUNISHING THE REBELS HE PUBLISHED ANEW A GENERAL PARDON TO WHICH HE FAITHFULLY ADHERED
7910-105673-0033 THAT THE KING'S AFFLICTION WAS DROWNED IN HIS JOY AND HE EXPRESSED GREAT SATISFACTION ON THE OCCASION THE PRINCE NOT SIX DAYS OLD WAS CREATED PRINCE OF WALES DUKE OF CORNWALL AND EARL OF CHESTER SIR EDWARD SEYMOUR THE QUEEN'S BROTHER
7910-105673-0034 FORMERLY MADE LORD BEAUCHAMP WAS RAISED TO THE DIGNITY OF EARL OF HERTFORD SIR WILLIAM FITZ WILLIAMS HIGH ADMIRAL WAS CREATED EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON SIR WILLIAM PAULET LORD SAINT JOHN
7910-105673-0035 INCREASED HIS CONSIDERATION AMONG FOREIGN PRINCES AND MADE HIS ALLIANCE BE COURTED BY ALL PARTIES HE MAINTAINED HOWEVER
7910-105673-0036 AND WITHOUT ANY DECISIVE EVENT BETWEEN CHARLES AND FRANCIS AND THOUGH INCLINED MORE TO FAVOR THE LATTER HE DETERMINED NOT TO INCUR WITHOUT NECESSITY EITHER HAZARD OR EXPENSE ON HIS ACCOUNT
7910-105673-0037 AND AFTERWARDS PROLONGED FOR TEN YEARS FREED HIM FROM ALL ANXIETY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS ALLY AND REESTABLISHED THE TRANQUILLITY OF EUROPE HENRY CONTINUED DESIROUS OF CEMENTING A UNION WITH THE GERMAN PROTESTANTS
7910-105673-0038 AND FOR THAT PURPOSE HE SENT CHRISTOPHER MOUNT TO A CONGRESS WHICH THEY HELD AT BRUNSWICK BUT THAT MINISTER MADE NO GREAT PROGRESS IN HIS NEGOTIATION THE PRINCES WISHED TO KNOW
7910-105673-0039 HE WOULD ONLY ALLOW A COPY OF IT TO BE DEPOSITED IN SOME PARISH CHURCHES WHERE IT WAS FIXED BY A CHAIN AND HE TOOK CARE TO INFORM THE PEOPLE BY PROCLAMATION THAT THIS INDULGENCE WAS NOT THE EFFECT OF HIS DUTY
7910-105673-0040 NOR PRESUME TO EXPOUND DOUBTFUL PLACES WITHOUT ADVICE FROM THE LEARNED IN THIS MEASURE AS IN THE REST
7910-105673-0041 THERE WAS ONLY ONE PARTICULAR IN WHICH HENRY WAS QUITE DECISIVE BECAUSE HE WAS THERE IMPELLED BY HIS AVARICE OR MORE PROPERLY SPEAKING HIS RAPACITY THE CONSEQUENCE OF HIS PROFUSION THIS MEASURE WAS THE ENTIRE DESTRUCTION OF THE MONASTERIES
7910-105673-0042 THE PRESENT OPPORTUNITY SEEMED FAVORABLE FOR THAT GREAT ENTERPRISE WHILE THE SUPPRESSION OF THE LATE REBELLION FORTIFIED AND INCREASED THE ROYAL AUTHORITY AND AS SOME OF THE ABBOTS WERE SUSPECTED OF HAVING ENCOURAGED THE INSURRECTION AND OF CORRESPONDING WITH THE REBELS
7910-105673-0043 THE KING'S RESENTMENT WAS FURTHER INCITED BY THAT MOTIVE ANEW VISITATION WAS APPOINTED OF ALL THE MONASTERIES IN ENGLAND AND A PRETENCE ONLY BEING WANTED FOR THEIR SUPPRESSION IT WAS EASY FOR A PRINCE POSSESSED OF SUCH UNLIMITED POWER
7910-105673-0044 AND SECONDING THE PRESENT HUMOR OF A GREAT PART OF THE NATION TO FIND OR FEIGN ONE THE ABBOTS AND MONKS KNEW THE DANGER TO WHICH THEY WERE EXPOSED AND HAVING LEARNED BY THE EXAMPLE OF THE LESSER MONASTERIES THAT NOTHING COULD WITHSTAND THE KING'S WILL
7910-105673-0045 THEY WERE MOST OF THEM INDUCED IN EXPECTATION OF BETTER TREATMENT TO MAKE A VOLUNTARY RESIGNATION OF THEIR HOUSES WHERE PROMISES FAILED OF EFFECT MENACES AND EVEN EXTREME VIOLENCE WERE EMPLOYED AND AS SEVERAL OF THE ABBOTS SINCE THE BREACH WITH ROME
7910-105673-0046 HAD BEEN NAMED BY THE COURT WITH A VIEW TO THIS EVENT THE KING'S INTENTIONS WERE THE MORE EASILY EFFECTED SOME ALSO HAVING SECRETLY EMBRACED THE DOCTRINE OF THE REFORMATION WERE GLAD TO BE FREED FROM THEIR VOWS AND ON THE WHOLE THE DESIGN WAS CONDUCTED WITH SUCH SUCCESS
