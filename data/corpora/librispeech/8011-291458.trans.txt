8011-291458-0000 THEY RECEIVE A THOUSAND CHARMS FROM THEIR VERY OBSCURITY AND THE FANCY DELIGHTS TO FILL UP THEIR OUTLINES WITH GRACES AND EXCELLENCES OF ITS OWN CREATION
8011-291458-0001 THUS LOOM ON MY IMAGINATION THOSE HAPPIER DAYS OF OUR CITY WHEN AS YET NEW AMSTERDAM WAS A MERE PASTORAL TOWN SHROUDED IN GROVES OF SYCAMORES AND WILLOWS AND SURROUNDED BY TRACKLESS FORESTS AND WIDE SPREADING WATERS
8011-291458-0002 AND THE FOSTERING CARE OF PROVIDENCE INCREASED AS RAPIDLY AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN BURDENED WITH A DOZEN PANNIERS FULL OF THOSE SAGE LAWS USUALLY HEAPED ON THE BACKS OF YOUNG CITIES
8011-291458-0003 AS THEY WOULD MAKE IT OUT TO BE AND AS FAR AS I HAVE OBSERVED I AM FULLY SATISFIED THAT MAN IF LEFT TO HIMSELF WOULD ABOUT AS READILY GO RIGHT AS WRONG IT IS ONLY THIS ETERNALLY SOUNDING IN HIS EARS
8011-291458-0004 THAT IT IS HIS DUTY TO GO RIGHT WHICH MAKES HIM GO THE VERY REVERSE THE NOBLE INDEPENDENCE OF HIS NATURE REVOLTS AT THIS INTOLERABLE TYRANNY OF LAW
8011-291458-0005 AND THE PERPETUAL INTERFERENCE OF OFFICIOUS MORALITY WHICH ARE EVER BESETTING HIS PATH WITH FINGER POSTS AND DIRECTIONS TO KEEP TO THE RIGHT AS THE LAW DIRECTS AND LIKE A SPIRITED URCHIN HE TURNS DIRECTLY CONTRARY AND GALLOPS THROUGH MUD AND MIRE
8011-291458-0006 BE PREACHED AND BE LECTURED AND GUIDED AND GOVERNED BY STATUTES AND LAWS AND BY LAWS AS ARE THEIR MORE ENLIGHTENED DESCENDANTS DID ONE AND ALL DEMEAN THEMSELVES HONESTLY AND PEACEABLY OUT OF PURE IGNORANCE OR
8011-291458-0007 AND THAT LIKE GOOD CHRISTIANS THEY WERE ALWAYS READY TO SERVE GOD AFTER THEY HAD FIRST SERVED THEMSELVES THUS HAVING QUIETLY SETTLED THEMSELVES DOWN AND PROVIDED FOR THEIR OWN COMFORT
8011-291458-0008 STILL RELIGIOUSLY OBSERVED IN ALL OUR ANCIENT FAMILIES OF THE RIGHT BREED OF HANGING UP A STOCKING IN THE CHIMNEY ON SAINT NICHOLAS EVE WHICH STOCKING IS ALWAYS FOUND IN THE MORNING MIRACULOUSLY FILLED FOR THE GOOD SAINT NICHOLAS HAS EVER BEEN A GREAT GIVER OF GIFTS
8011-291458-0009 WAS ELEVATED IN FRONT OF THIS CHAPEL IN THE CENTER OF WHAT IN MODERN DAYS IS CALLED THE BOWLING GREEN ON THE VERY SPOT IN FACT WHERE HE APPEARED IN VISION TO OLOFFE THE DREAMER
8011-291458-0010 AND THE LEGEND FURTHER TREATS OF DIVERS MIRACLES WROUGHT BY THE MIGHTY PIPE WHICH THE SAINT HELD IN HIS MOUTH
8011-291458-0011 AS HOWEVER IN SPITE OF THE MOST DILIGENT SEARCH I CANNOT LAY MY HANDS UPON THIS LITTLE BOOK I MUST CONFESS THAT I ENTERTAIN CONSIDERABLE DOUBT ON THE SUBJECT THUS BENIGNLY FOSTERED BY THE GOOD SAINT NICHOLAS
8011-291458-0012 THE INFANT CITY THRIVED APACE HORDES OF PAINTED SAVAGES IT IS TRUE STILL LURKED ABOUT THE UNSETTLED PARTS OF THE ISLAND THE HUNTER STILL PITCHED HIS BOWER OF SKINS AND BARK BESIDE THE RILLS
8011-291458-0013 A MUTUAL GOOD WILL HOWEVER EXISTED BETWEEN THESE WANDERING BEINGS AND THE BURGHERS OF NEW AMSTERDAM OUR BENEVOLENT FOREFATHERS ENDEAVORED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO AMELIORATE THEIR SITUATION
8011-291458-0014 BY GIVING THEM GIN RUM AND GLASS BEADS IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR PELTRIES FOR IT SEEMS THE KIND HEARTED DUTCHMEN HAD CONCEIVED A GREAT FRIENDSHIP FOR THEIR SAVAGE NEIGHBORS ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR BEING PLEASANT MEN TO TRADE WITH AND LITTLE SKILLED IN THE ART OF MAKING A BARGAIN
8011-291458-0015 NOW AND THEN A CREW OF THESE HALF HUMAN SONS OF THE FOREST WOULD MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE IN THE STREETS OF NEW AMSTERDAM FANTASTICALLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH BEADS AND FLAUNTING FEATHERS SAUNTERING ABOUT WITH AN AIR OF LISTLESS INDIFFERENCE
8011-291458-0016 SOMETIMES IN THE MARKETPLACE INSTRUCTING THE LITTLE DUTCH BOYS IN THE USE OF THE BOW AND ARROW AT OTHER TIMES INFLAMED WITH LIQUOR SWAGGERING AND WHOOPING AND YELLING ABOUT THE TOWN LIKE SO MANY FIENDS TO THE GREAT DISMAY OF ALL THE GOOD WIVES
8011-291458-0017 WHO WOULD HURRY THEIR CHILDREN INTO THE HOUSE FASTEN THE DOORS AND THROW WATER UPON THE ENEMY FROM THE GARRET WINDOWS IT IS WORTHY OF MENTION HERE THAT OUR FOREFATHERS WERE VERY PARTICULAR IN HOLDING UP THESE WILD MEN AS EXCELLENT DOMESTIC EXAMPLES
8011-291458-0018 WHETHER THIS AWFUL EXAMPLE HAD ANY INFLUENCE OR NOT HISTORY DOES NOT MENTION BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT OUR GRANDMOTHERS WERE MIRACLES OF FIDELITY AND OBEDIENCE
8011-291458-0019 TRUE IT IS THAT THE GOOD UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN OUR ANCESTORS AND THEIR SAVAGE NEIGHBORS WAS LIABLE TO OCCASIONAL INTERRUPTIONS AND I HAVE HEARD MY GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS A VERY WISE OLD WOMAN AND WELL VERSED IN THE HISTORY OF THESE PARTS
8011-291458-0020 TELL A LONG STORY OF A WINTER'S EVENING ABOUT A BATTLE BETWEEN THE NEW AMSTERDAMMERS AND THE INDIANS WHICH WAS KNOWN BY THE NAME OF THE PEACH WAR AND WHICH TOOK PLACE NEAR A PEACH ORCHARD IN A DARK GLEN
8011-291458-0021 WHICH FOR A LONG WHILE WENT BY THE NAME OF MURDERER'S VALLEY THE LEGEND OF THIS SYLVAN WAR WAS LONG CURRENT AMONG THE NURSES
8011-291458-0022 BUT TIME AND IMPROVEMENT HAVE ALMOST OBLITERATED BOTH THE TRADITION AND THE SCENE OF BATTLE FOR WHAT WAS ONCE THE BLOOD STAINED VALLEY IS NOW IN THE CENTER OF THIS POPULOUS CITY AND KNOWN BY THE NAME OF DEY STREET
8011-291458-0023 I KNOW NOT WHETHER IT WAS TO THIS PEACH WAR AND THE ACQUISITIONS OF INDIAN LAND WHICH MAY HAVE GROWN OUT OF IT THAT WE MAY ASCRIBE THE FIRST SEEDS OF THE SPIRIT OF ANNEXATION WHICH NOW BEGAN TO MANIFEST THEMSELVES HITHERTO
8011-291458-0024 THE AMBITION OF THE WORTHY BURGHERS HAD BEEN CONFINED TO THE LOVELY ISLAND OF MANNA HATA AND SPITEN DEVIL ON THE HUDSON AND HELL GATE ON THE SOUND WERE TO THEM THE PILLARS OF HERCULES THE NE PLUS ULTRA OF HUMAN ENTERPRISE
8011-291458-0025 THAN THE LAND THEY OCCUPY IT IS HINTED THAT OLOFFE THE DREAMER ENCOURAGED THESE NOTIONS HAVING AS HAS BEEN SHOWN THE INHERENT SPIRIT OF A LAND SPECULATOR WHICH HAD BEEN WONDERFULLY QUICKENED AND EXPANDED SINCE HE HAD BECOME A LANDHOLDER
8011-291458-0026 MANY OF THE COMMON PEOPLE WHO HAD NEVER BEFORE OWNED A FOOT OF LAND
8011-291458-0027 OTHERS WHO HAD SNUG FARMS AND TOBACCO PLANTATIONS FOUND THEY HAD NOT SUFFICIENT ELBOW ROOM AND BEGAN TO QUESTION THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIANS TO THE VAST REGIONS THEY PRETENDED TO HOLD WHILE THE GOOD OLOFFE INDULGED IN MAGNIFICENT DREAMS
8011-291458-0028 WITH WHICH HE COULD SPY UP THE CROOKEDEST RIVER QUITE TO ITS HEAD WATERS
8011-291458-0029 IN CASE OF ANY DISPUTE WITH THE INDIANS WHAT WAS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THESE EXPLORING EXPEDITIONS IN A LITTLE WHILE WE FIND A FRONTIER POST OR TRADING HOUSE CALLED FORT NASSAU ESTABLISHED FAR TO THE SOUTH ON DELAWARE RIVER
8011-291458-0030 THAT THE SWELLING IMPORTANCE OF THE NIEUW NEDERLANDTS AWAKENED THE ATTENTION OF THE MOTHER COUNTRY WHO FINDING IT LIKELY TO YIELD MUCH REVENUE AND NO TROUBLE BEGAN TO TAKE THAT INTEREST IN ITS WELFARE WHICH KNOWING PEOPLE EVINCE FOR RICH RELATIONS
