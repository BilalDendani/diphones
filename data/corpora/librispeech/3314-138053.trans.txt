3314-138053-0000 FELT THAT THE LIFE HE WAS LEADING IN THE CASTLE WAS ENTIRELY INCONSISTENT WITH THE ORDER OF CHIVALRY HE PROFESSED SO HE DETERMINED TO ASK THE DUKE AND DUCHESS TO PERMIT HIM TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE FOR SARAGOSSA
3314-138053-0001 AS THE TIME OF THE FESTIVAL WAS NOW DRAWING NEAR AND HE HOPED TO WIN THERE THE SUIT OF ARMOUR WHICH IS THE PRIZE AT FESTIVALS OF THE SORT
3314-138053-0002 BUT ONE DAY AT TABLE WITH THE DUKE AND DUCHESS JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO CARRY HIS RESOLUTION INTO EFFECT AND ASK FOR THEIR PERMISSION LO AND BEHOLD SUDDENLY THERE CAME IN THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE GREAT HALL TWO WOMEN
3314-138053-0003 AS THEY AFTERWARDS PROVED TO BE DRAPED IN MOURNING FROM HEAD TO FOOT ONE OF WHOM APPROACHING DON QUIXOTE FLUNG HERSELF AT FULL LENGTH AT HIS FEET
3314-138053-0004 SO SAD SO DEEP AND SO DOLEFUL THAT SHE PUT ALL WHO HEARD AND SAW HER INTO A STATE OF PERPLEXITY
3314-138053-0005 AND THOUGH THE DUKE AND DUCHESS SUPPOSED IT MUST BE SOME JOKE THEIR SERVANTS WERE PLAYING OFF UPON DON QUIXOTE STILL THE EARNEST WAY THE WOMAN SIGHED AND MOANED AND WEPT PUZZLED THEM AND MADE THEM FEEL UNCERTAIN
3314-138053-0006 UNTIL DON QUIXOTE TOUCHED WITH COMPASSION RAISED HER UP AND MADE HER UNVEIL HERSELF AND REMOVE THE MANTLE FROM HER TEARFUL FACE SHE COMPLIED AND DISCLOSED WHAT NO ONE COULD HAVE EVER ANTICIPATED
3314-138053-0007 THEY DID NOT THINK HER CAPABLE OF CRAZY PRANKS DONA RODRIGUEZ AT LENGTH TURNING TO HER MASTER AND MISTRESS SAID TO THEM WILL YOUR EXCELLENCES BE PLEASED TO PERMIT ME TO SPEAK TO THIS GENTLEMAN FOR A MOMENT
3314-138053-0008 FOR IT IS REQUISITE I SHOULD DO SO IN ORDER TO GET SUCCESSFULLY OUT OF THE BUSINESS IN WHICH THE BOLDNESS OF AN EVIL MINDED CLOWN HAS INVOLVED ME THE DUKE SAID THAT FOR HIS PART HE GAVE HER LEAVE
3314-138053-0009 I GAVE YOU AN ACCOUNT OF THE INJUSTICE AND TREACHERY OF A WICKED FARMER TO MY DEARLY BELOVED DAUGHTER THE UNHAPPY DAMSEL HERE BEFORE YOU AND YOU PROMISED ME TO TAKE HER PART AND RIGHT THE WRONG THAT HAS BEEN DONE HER
3314-138053-0010 FOR TO EXPECT THAT MY LORD THE DUKE WILL DO ME JUSTICE IS TO ASK PEARS FROM THE ELM TREE FOR THE REASON I STATED PRIVATELY TO YOUR WORSHIP AND SO MAY OUR LORD GRANT YOU GOOD HEALTH AND FORSAKE US NOT
3314-138053-0011 AND SPARE YOUR SIGHS FOR I TAKE IT UPON MYSELF TO OBTAIN REDRESS FOR YOUR DAUGHTER FOR WHOM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER NOT TO HAVE BEEN SO READY TO BELIEVE LOVERS PROMISES
3314-138053-0012 WHICH ARE FOR THE MOST PART QUICKLY MADE AND VERY SLOWLY PERFORMED AND SO WITH MY LORD THE DUKE'S LEAVE I WILL AT ONCE GO IN QUEST OF THIS INHUMAN YOUTH AND WILL FIND HIM OUT AND CHALLENGE HIM AND SLAY HIM
3314-138053-0013 IF SO BE HE REFUSES TO KEEP HIS PROMISED WORD FOR THE CHIEF OBJECT OF MY PROFESSION IS TO SPARE THE HUMBLE AND CHASTISE THE PROUD I MEAN TO HELP THE DISTRESSED AND DESTROY THE OPPRESSORS
3314-138053-0014 THERE IS NO NECESSITY SAID THE DUKE FOR YOUR WORSHIP TO TAKE THE TROUBLE OF SEEKING OUT THE RUSTIC OF WHOM THIS WORTHY DUENNA COMPLAINS NOR IS THERE ANY NECESSITY EITHER FOR ASKING MY LEAVE TO CHALLENGE HIM
3314-138053-0015 FOR I ADMIT HIM DULY CHALLENGED AND WILL TAKE CARE THAT HE IS INFORMED OF THE CHALLENGE AND ACCEPTS IT AND COMES TO ANSWER IT IN PERSON TO THIS CASTLE OF MINE
3314-138053-0016 WHERE I SHALL AFFORD TO BOTH A FAIR FIELD OBSERVING ALL THE CONDITIONS WHICH ARE USUALLY AND PROPERLY OBSERVED IN SUCH TRIALS AND OBSERVING TOO JUSTICE TO BOTH SIDES
3314-138053-0017 AS ALL PRINCES WHO OFFER A FREE FIELD TO COMBATANTS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THEIR LORDSHIPS ARE BOUND TO DO THEN WITH THAT ASSURANCE AND YOUR HIGHNESS'S GOOD LEAVE SAID DON QUIXOTE
3314-138053-0018 I HEREBY FOR THIS ONCE WAIVE MY PRIVILEGE OF GENTLE BLOOD AND COME DOWN AND PUT MYSELF ON A LEVEL WITH THE LOWLY BIRTH OF THE WRONG DOER
3314-138053-0019 MAKING MYSELF EQUAL WITH HIM AND ENABLING HIM TO ENTER INTO COMBAT WITH ME AND SO I CHALLENGE AND DEFY HIM THOUGH ABSENT ON THE PLEA OF HIS MALFEASANCE IN BREAKING FAITH WITH THIS POOR DAMSEL
3314-138053-0020 WHO WAS A MAIDEN AND NOW BY HIS MISDEED IS NONE AND SAY THAT HE SHALL FULFILL THE PROMISE HE GAVE HER TO BECOME HER LAWFUL HUSBAND OR ELSE STAKE HIS LIFE UPON THE QUESTION
3314-138053-0021 AND THEN PLUCKING OFF A GLOVE HE THREW IT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALL AND THE DUKE PICKED IT UP SAYING AS HE HAD SAID BEFORE THAT HE ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE IN THE NAME OF HIS VASSAL
3314-138053-0022 AND FIXED SIX DAYS THENCE AS THE TIME THE COURTYARD OF THE CASTLE AS THE PLACE AND FOR ARMS THE CUSTOMARY ONES OF KNIGHTS LANCE AND SHIELD AND FULL ARMOUR
3314-138053-0023 WITH ALL THE OTHER ACCESSORIES WITHOUT TRICKERY GUILE OR CHARMS OF ANY SORT AND EXAMINED AND PASSED BY THE JUDGES OF THE FIELD BUT FIRST OF ALL HE SAID
3314-138053-0024 IT IS REQUISITE THAT THIS WORTHY DUENNA AND UNWORTHY DAMSEL SHOULD PLACE THEIR CLAIM FOR JUSTICE IN THE HANDS OF DON QUIXOTE FOR OTHERWISE NOTHING CAN BE DONE NOR CAN THE SAID CHALLENGE BE BROUGHT TO A LAWFUL ISSUE
3314-138053-0025 AND I TOO ADDED HER DAUGHTER ALL IN TEARS AND COVERED WITH SHAME AND CONFUSION THIS DECLARATION HAVING BEEN MADE AND THE DUKE HAVING SETTLED IN HIS OWN MIND WHAT HE WOULD DO IN THE MATTER
3314-138053-0026 THE LADIES IN BLACK WITHDREW AND THE DUCHESS GAVE ORDERS THAT FOR THE FUTURE THEY WERE NOT TO BE TREATED AS SERVANTS OF HERS BUT AS LADY ADVENTURERS WHO CAME TO HER HOUSE TO DEMAND JUSTICE
3314-138053-0027 ENTERED THE HALL AND THE DUKE AND DUCHESS WERE VERY WELL PLEASED TO SEE HIM BEING ANXIOUS TO KNOW THE RESULT OF HIS JOURNEY
3314-138053-0028 BUT WHEN THEY ASKED HIM THE PAGE SAID IN REPLY THAT HE COULD NOT GIVE IT BEFORE SO MANY PEOPLE OR IN A FEW WORDS AND BEGGED THEIR EXCELLENCES TO BE PLEASED TO LET IT WAIT FOR A PRIVATE OPPORTUNITY
3314-138053-0029 AND IN THE MEANTIME AMUSE THEMSELVES WITH THESE LETTERS AND TAKING OUT THE LETTERS HE PLACED THEM IN THE DUCHESS'S HAND ONE BORE BY WAY OF ADDRESS LETTER FOR MY LADY THE DUCHESS SO AND SO OF I DON'T KNOW WHERE
3314-138053-0030 SHE READ OUT AS FOLLOWS TERESA PANZA'S LETTER TO THE DUCHESS THE LETTER YOUR HIGHNESS WROTE ME MY LADY GAVE ME GREAT PLEASURE FOR INDEED I FOUND IT VERY WELCOME

3314-138053-0032 THEY MAY ALL SAY WHAT THEY LIKE THOUGH TO TELL THE TRUTH IF THE CORAL BEADS AND THE SUIT HAD NOT COME I WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT EITHER FOR IN THIS VILLAGE EVERYBODY THINKS MY HUSBAND A NUMSKULL
3314-138053-0033 AND EXCEPT FOR GOVERNING A FLOCK OF GOATS THEY CANNOT FANCY WHAT SORT OF GOVERNMENT HE CAN BE FIT FOR GOD GRANT IT AND DIRECT HIM ACCORDING AS HE SEES HIS CHILDREN STAND IN NEED OF IT
3314-138053-0034 AND GO TO COURT TO STRETCH MYSELF AT EASE IN A COACH

3314-138053-0049 TO BE SURE HE HAS NOW LAID ASIDE HIS PAINT BRUSH AND TAKEN A SPADE IN HAND AND GOES TO THE FIELD LIKE A GENTLEMAN PEDRO LOBO'S SON HAS RECEIVED THE FIRST ORDERS
3314-138053-0050 EVIL TONGUES SAY SHE IS WITH CHILD BY HIM BUT HE DENIES IT STOUTLY
3314-138053-0051 A COMPANY OF SOLDIERS PASSED THROUGH HERE WHEN THEY LEFT THEY TOOK AWAY WITH THEM THREE OF THE GIRLS OF THE VILLAGE I WILL NOT TELL THEE WHO THEY ARE
3314-138053-0052 PERHAPS THEY WILL COME BACK AND THEY WILL BE SURE TO FIND THOSE WHO WILL TAKE THEM FOR WIVES WITH ALL THEIR BLEMISHES GOOD OR BAD
3314-138053-0053 WHICH SHE PUTS INTO A MONEYBOX AS A HELP TOWARDS HOUSE FURNISHING BUT NOW THAT SHE IS A GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER THOU WILT GIVE HER A PORTION WITHOUT HER WORKING FOR IT THE FOUNTAIN IN THE PLAZA HAS RUN DRY
3314-138053-0054 I LOOK FOR AN ANSWER TO THIS AND TO KNOW THY MIND ABOUT MY GOING TO THE COURT AND SO GOD KEEP THEE LONGER THAN ME OR AS LONG FOR I WOULD NOT LEAVE THEE IN THIS WORLD WITHOUT ME
3314-138053-0055 THE LETTERS WERE APPLAUDED LAUGHED OVER RELISHED AND ADMIRED AND THEN AS IF TO PUT THE SEAL TO THE BUSINESS THE COURIER ARRIVED BRINGING THE ONE SANCHO SENT TO DON QUIXOTE
3314-138053-0056 AND THIS TOO WAS READ OUT AND IT RAISED SOME DOUBTS AS TO THE GOVERNOR'S SIMPLICITY THE DUCHESS WITHDREW TO HEAR FROM THE PAGE ABOUT HIS ADVENTURES IN SANCHO'S VILLAGE
3314-138053-0057 WHICH HE NARRATED AT FULL LENGTH WITHOUT LEAVING A SINGLE CIRCUMSTANCE UNMENTIONED HE GAVE HER THE ACORNS AND ALSO A CHEESE WHICH TERESA HAD GIVEN HIM AS BEING PARTICULARLY GOOD AND SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF TRONCHON
3314-138053-0058 THE DUCHESS RECEIVED IT WITH GREATEST DELIGHT IN WHICH WE WILL LEAVE HER TO DESCRIBE THE END OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE GREAT SANCHO PANZA FLOWER AND MIRROR OF ALL GOVERNORS OF ISLANDS
3314-138053-0059 TO FANCY THAT IN THIS LIFE ANYTHING BELONGING TO IT WILL REMAIN FOR EVER IN THE SAME STATE IS AN IDLE FANCY ON THE CONTRARY IN IT EVERYTHING SEEMS TO GO IN A CIRCLE I MEAN ROUND AND ROUND
3314-138053-0060 THE SPRING SUCCEEDS THE SUMMER THE SUMMER THE FALL THE FALL THE AUTUMN THE AUTUMN THE WINTER AND THE WINTER THE SPRING AND SO TIME ROLLS WITH NEVER CEASING WHEEL MAN'S LIFE ALONE SWIFTER THAN TIME
3314-138053-0061 SPEEDS ONWARD TO ITS END WITHOUT ANY HOPE OF RENEWAL SAVE IT BE IN THAT OTHER LIFE WHICH IS ENDLESS AND BOUNDLESS
3314-138053-0062 FOR THERE ARE MANY THAT BY THE LIGHT OF NATURE ALONE WITHOUT THE LIGHT OF FAITH HAVE A COMPREHENSION OF THE FLEETING NATURE AND INSTABILITY OF THIS PRESENT LIFE AND THE ENDLESS DURATION OF THAT ETERNAL LIFE WE HOPE FOR
3314-138053-0063 MELTED AWAY DISAPPEARED VANISHED AS IT WERE IN SMOKE AND SHADOW FOR AS HE LAY IN BED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SEVENTH DAY OF HIS GOVERNMENT SATED NOT WITH BREAD AND WINE
3314-138053-0064 BUT WITH DELIVERING JUDGMENTS AND GIVING OPINIONS AND MAKING LAWS AND PROCLAMATIONS JUST AS SLEEP IN SPITE OF HUNGER WAS BEGINNING TO CLOSE HIS EYELIDS HE HEARD SUCH A NOISE OF BELL RINGING AND SHOUTING
3314-138053-0065 THAT ONE WOULD HAVE FANCIED THE WHOLE ISLAND WAS GOING TO THE BOTTOM HE SAT UP IN BED AND REMAINED LISTENING INTENTLY TO TRY IF HE COULD MAKE OUT WHAT COULD BE THE CAUSE OF SO GREAT AN UPROAR
3314-138053-0066 NOT ONLY HOWEVER WAS HE UNABLE TO DISCOVER WHAT IT WAS BUT AS COUNTLESS DRUMS AND TRUMPETS NOW HELPED TO SWELL THE DIN OF THE BELLS AND SHOUTS HE WAS MORE PUZZLED THAN EVER
3314-138053-0067 AND FILLED WITH FEAR AND TERROR AND GETTING UP HE PUT ON A PAIR OF SLIPPERS BECAUSE OF THE DAMPNESS OF THE FLOOR AND WITHOUT THROWING A DRESSING GOWN OR ANYTHING OF THE KIND OVER HIM HE RUSHED OUT OF THE DOOR OF HIS ROOM
3314-138053-0068 TO ARMS TO ARMS SENOR GOVERNOR TO ARMS THE ENEMY IS IN THE ISLAND IN COUNTLESS NUMBERS AND WE ARE LOST UNLESS YOUR SKILL AND VALOUR COME TO OUR SUPPORT KEEPING UP THIS NOISE TUMULT AND UPROAR
