258-121528-0000 BUT TELEMACHUS COULD GET NO REST ALL NIGHT FOR THINKING OF HIS UNHAPPY FATHER SO MINERVA WENT CLOSE UP TO HIM AND SAID TELEMACHUS YOU SHOULD NOT REMAIN SO FAR AWAY FROM HOME ANY LONGER NOR LEAVE YOUR PROPERTY WITH SUCH DANGEROUS PEOPLE IN YOUR HOUSE
258-121528-0001 THEY WILL EAT UP EVERYTHING YOU HAVE AMONG THEM AND YOU WILL HAVE BEEN ON A FOOL'S ERRAND
258-121528-0002 AND HAS BEEN GREATLY INCREASING HIS WEDDING PRESENTS I HOPE NOTHING VALUABLE MAY HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM THE HOUSE IN SPITE OF YOU BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WOMEN ARE THEY ALWAYS WANT TO DO THE BEST THEY CAN FOR THE MAN WHO MARRIES THEM
258-121528-0003 AND NEVER GIVE ANOTHER THOUGHT TO THE CHILDREN OF THEIR FIRST HUSBAND NOR TO THEIR FATHER EITHER WHEN HE IS DEAD AND DONE WITH GO HOME THEREFORE AND PUT EVERYTHING IN CHARGE OF THE MOST RESPECTABLE WOMAN SERVANT THAT YOU HAVE UNTIL IT SHALL PLEASE HEAVEN TO SEND YOU A WIFE OF YOUR OWN
258-121528-0004 LET ME TELL YOU ALSO OF ANOTHER MATTER WHICH YOU HAD BETTER ATTEND TO
258-121528-0005 AND THEY MEAN TO KILL YOU BEFORE YOU CAN REACH HOME I DO NOT MUCH THINK THEY WILL SUCCEED IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT SOME OF THOSE WHO ARE NOW EATING UP YOUR PROPERTY WILL FIND A GRAVE THEMSELVES SAIL NIGHT AND DAY AND KEEP YOUR SHIP WELL AWAY FROM THE ISLANDS
258-121528-0006 THE GOD WHO WATCHES OVER YOU AND PROTECTS YOU WILL SEND YOU A FAIR WIND AS SOON AS YOU GET TO ITHACA SEND YOUR SHIP AND MEN ON TO THE TOWN
258-121528-0007 HE IS WELL DISPOSED TOWARDS YOU STAY WITH HIM THEREFORE FOR THE NIGHT
258-121528-0008 THEN SHE WENT BACK TO OLYMPUS
258-121528-0009 AND LET HIM SAY GOOD BYE TO US IN THE USUAL WAY SO LONG AS HE LIVES
258-121528-0010 AS HE SPOKE DAY BEGAN TO BREAK
258-121528-0011 SAID HE LET ME GO BACK NOW TO MY OWN COUNTRY FOR I WANT TO GET HOME
258-121528-0012 IF YOU INSIST ON GOING I WILL NOT DETAIN YOU I DO NOT LIKE TO SEE A HOST EITHER TOO FOND OF HIS GUEST OR TOO RUDE TO HIM MODERATION IS BEST IN ALL THINGS AND NOT LETTING A MAN GO WHEN HE WANTS TO DO SO IS AS BAD AS TELLING HIM TO GO IF HE WOULD LIKE TO STAY
258-121528-0013 ONE SHOULD TREAT A GUEST WELL AS LONG AS HE IS IN THE HOUSE AND SPEED HIM WHEN HE WANTS TO LEAVE IT WAIT THEN TILL I CAN GET YOUR BEAUTIFUL PRESENTS INTO YOUR CHARIOT AND TILL YOU HAVE YOURSELF SEEN THEM
258-121528-0014 I WILL TELL THE WOMEN TO PREPARE A SUFFICIENT DINNER FOR YOU OF WHAT THERE MAY BE IN THE HOUSE IT WILL BE AT ONCE MORE PROPER AND CHEAPER FOR YOU TO GET YOUR DINNER BEFORE SETTING OUT ON SUCH A LONG JOURNEY IF MOREOVER YOU HAVE A FANCY FOR MAKING A TOUR IN HELLAS OR IN THE PELOPONNESE
258-121528-0015 I WILL YOKE MY HORSES AND WILL CONDUCT YOU MYSELF THROUGH ALL OUR PRINCIPAL CITIES NO ONE WILL SEND US AWAY EMPTY HANDED EVERY ONE WILL GIVE US SOMETHING A BRONZE TRIPOD A COUPLE OF MULES OR A GOLD CUP
258-121528-0016 FOR WHEN I CAME AWAY I LEFT MY PROPERTY WITHOUT PROTECTION AND FEAR THAT WHILE LOOKING FOR MY FATHER I SHALL COME TO RUIN MYSELF OR FIND THAT SOMETHING VALUABLE HAS BEEN STOLEN DURING MY ABSENCE
258-121528-0017 WHEN HE REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE TREASURES OF HIS HOUSE WERE KEPT HE SELECTED A DOUBLE CUP
258-121528-0018 I WILL NOW PRESENT YOU WITH THE FINEST AND MOST PRECIOUS PIECE OF PLATE IN ALL MY HOUSE IT IS A MIXING BOWL OF PURE SILVER EXCEPT THE RIM WHICH IS INLAID WITH GOLD AND IT IS THE WORK OF VULCAN
258-121528-0019 I SHOULD LIKE TO GIVE IT TO YOU WITH THESE WORDS HE PLACED THE DOUBLE CUP IN THE HANDS OF TELEMACHUS WHILE MEGAPENTHES BROUGHT THE BEAUTIFUL MIXING BOWL AND SET IT BEFORE HIM HARD BY STOOD LOVELY HELEN WITH THE ROBE READY IN HER HAND
258-121528-0020 I TOO MY SON SAID SHE HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU AS A KEEPSAKE FROM THE HAND OF HELEN IT IS FOR YOUR BRIDE TO WEAR UPON HER WEDDING DAY TILL THEN GET YOUR DEAR MOTHER TO KEEP IT FOR YOU
258-121528-0021 SO SAYING SHE GAVE THE ROBE OVER TO HIM AND HE RECEIVED IT GLADLY
258-121528-0022 AND ADMIRED THEM ALL AS HE DID SO
258-121528-0023 AND THEY BOTH OF THEM SAT DOWN TO TABLE A MAID SERVANT BROUGHT THEM WATER IN A BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN EWER AND POURED IT INTO A SILVER BASIN FOR THEM TO WASH THEIR HANDS AND SHE DREW A CLEAN TABLE BESIDE THEM AN UPPER SERVANT BROUGHT THEM BREAD
258-121528-0024 AND OFFERED THEM MANY GOOD THINGS OF WHAT THERE WAS IN THE HOUSE ETEONEUS CARVED THE MEAT AND GAVE THEM EACH THEIR PORTIONS WHILE MEGAPENTHES POURED OUT THE WINE THEN THEY LAID THEIR HANDS UPON THE GOOD THINGS THAT WERE BEFORE THEM
258-121528-0025 BUT AS SOON AS THEY HAD HAD ENOUGH TO EAT AND DRINK
258-121528-0026 AND TOOK THEIR PLACES IN THE CHARIOT THEY DROVE OUT THROUGH THE INNER GATEWAY AND UNDER THE ECHOING GATEHOUSE OF THE OUTER COURT
258-121528-0027 THAT THEY MIGHT MAKE A DRINK OFFERING BEFORE THEY SET OUT HE STOOD IN FRONT OF THE HORSES AND PLEDGED THEM SAYING FAREWELL TO BOTH OF YOU SEE THAT YOU TELL NESTOR HOW I HAVE TREATED YOU
258-121528-0028 WE WILL BE SURE SIR ANSWERED TELEMACHUS
258-121528-0029 I WISH I WERE AS CERTAIN OF FINDING ULYSSES RETURNED WHEN I GET BACK TO ITHACA THAT I MIGHT TELL HIM OF THE VERY GREAT KINDNESS YOU HAVE SHOWN ME AND OF THE MANY BEAUTIFUL PRESENTS I AM TAKING WITH ME
258-121528-0030 AS HE WAS THUS SPEAKING A BIRD FLEW ON HIS RIGHT HAND AN EAGLE WITH A GREAT WHITE GOOSE IN ITS TALONS WHICH IT HAD CARRIED OFF FROM THE FARM YARD AND ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN WERE RUNNING AFTER IT AND SHOUTING
258-121528-0031 IT CAME QUITE CLOSE UP TO THEM AND FLEW AWAY ON THEIR RIGHT HANDS IN FRONT OF THE HORSES WHEN THEY SAW IT THEY WERE GLAD AND THEIR HEARTS TOOK COMFORT WITHIN THEM
258-121528-0032 HAS HEAVEN SENT THIS OMEN FOR US OR FOR YOU
258-121528-0033 BUT HELEN WAS TOO QUICK FOR HIM AND SAID I WILL READ THIS MATTER AS HEAVEN HAS PUT IT IN MY HEART AND AS I DOUBT NOT THAT IT WILL COME TO PASS THE EAGLE CAME FROM THE MOUNTAIN WHERE IT WAS BRED AND HAS ITS NEST
258-121528-0034 WILL RETURN TO TAKE HIS REVENGE IF INDEED HE IS NOT BACK ALREADY AND HATCHING MISCHIEF FOR THE SUITORS MAY JOVE SO GRANT IT REPLIED TELEMACHUS IF IT SHOULD PROVE TO BE SO
258-121528-0035 I WILL MAKE VOWS TO YOU AS THOUGH YOU WERE A GOD EVEN WHEN I AM AT HOME AS HE SPOKE HE LASHED HIS HORSES AND THEY STARTED OFF AT FULL SPEED THROUGH THE TOWN TOWARDS THE OPEN COUNTRY THEY SWAYED THE YOKE UPON THEIR NECKS
258-121528-0036 AND TRAVELLED THE WHOLE DAY LONG TILL THE SUN SET AND DARKNESS WAS OVER ALL THE LAND
258-121528-0037 WHERE DIOCLES LIVED WHO WAS SON OF ORTILOCHUS THE SON OF ALPHEUS THERE THEY PASSED THE NIGHT AND WERE TREATED HOSPITABLY WHEN THE CHILD OF MORNING ROSY FINGERED DAWN APPEARED THEY AGAIN YOKED THEIR HORSES AND THEIR PLACES IN THE CHARIOT
258-121528-0038 THEY DROVE OUT THROUGH THE INNER GATEWAY AND UNDER THE ECHOING GATEHOUSE OF THE OUTER COURT
258-121528-0039 I HOPE YOU WILL PROMISE TO DO WHAT I AM GOING TO ASK YOU YOU KNOW OUR FATHERS WERE OLD FRIENDS BEFORE US MOREOVER WE ARE BOTH OF AN AGE AND THIS JOURNEY HAS BROUGHT US TOGETHER STILL MORE CLOSELY
258-121528-0040 DO NOT THEREFORE TAKE ME PAST MY SHIP BUT LEAVE ME THERE FOR IF I GO TO YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE HE WILL TRY TO KEEP ME IN THE WARMTH OF HIS GOOD WILL TOWARDS ME AND I MUST GO HOME AT ONCE
258-121528-0041 AND IN THE END HE DEEMED IT BEST TO TURN HIS HORSES TOWARDS THE SHIP
258-121528-0042 THEN HE SAID GO ON BOARD AT ONCE AND TELL YOUR MEN TO DO SO ALSO BEFORE I CAN REACH HOME TO TELL MY FATHER I KNOW HOW OBSTINATE HE IS AND AM SURE HE WILL NOT LET YOU GO
258-121528-0043 HE WILL COME DOWN HERE TO FETCH YOU AND HE WILL NOT GO BACK WITHOUT YOU BUT HE WILL BE VERY ANGRY WITH THIS HE DROVE HIS GOODLY STEEDS BACK TO THE CITY OF THE PYLIANS AND SOON REACHED HIS HOME
258-121528-0044 BUT TELEMACHUS CALLED THE MEN TOGETHER AND GAVE HIS ORDERS NOW MY MEN SAID HE GET EVERYTHING IN ORDER ON BOARD THE SHIP AND LET US SET OUT HOME THUS DID HE SPEAK AND THEY WENT ON BOARD EVEN AS HE HAD SAID
258-121528-0045 BUT AS TELEMACHUS WAS THUS BUSIED PRAYING ALSO AND SACRIFICING TO MINERVA IN THE SHIP'S STERN THERE CAME TO HIM A MAN FROM A DISTANT COUNTRY A SEER WHO WAS FLYING FROM ARGOS BECAUSE HE HAD KILLED A MAN HE WAS DESCENDED FROM MELAMPUS
