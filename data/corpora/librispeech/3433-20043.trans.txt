3433-20043-0000 I ADMIRE COWS IN THEIR PROPER PLACES THEY ARE UNDOUBTEDLY USEFUL ANIMALS SOME MAY THINK THEM HANDSOME AND GRACEFUL THIS IS AS YET AN UNSETTLED QUESTION
3433-20043-0001 I DO NOT OBJECT TO SEE THEM AT A DISTANCE QUIETLY GRAZING IN A MEADOW BY THE BRINK OF A WINDING STREAM AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING PROVIDED THE DISTANCE IS VERY GREAT AND A STRONG FENCE INTERVENES FOR
3433-20043-0002 AND HAVE A MORTAL DREAD OF COWS I AM NOT USED TO THE CUSTOMS OF COUNTRY LIFE WHICH PLACE THIS ANIMAL ON A LEVEL WITH DOMESTIC PETS AND WHEN MY BROTHER ASKED ME TO PAT THE SIDE OF ONE OF THESE GREAT COARSE BRUTES
3433-20043-0003 I SCREAMED AT THE MERE IDEA FOR I SHOULD BE EXTREMELY UNWILLING TO PROVOKE ONE OF THEM BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT WHEN HEATED WITH PASSION AS THESE BEASTS OFTEN ARE IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS
3433-20043-0004 THAT THE POWDER HORNS ON TOP OF THEIR HEADS EXPLODE AND SPREAD RUIN AND DESOLATION AROUND PEOPLE HERE BESTOW A VAST DEAL TOO MUCH CONSIDERATION ON THESE UNPLEASANT ANIMALS
3433-20043-0005 WHO WEAR VEILS IN THE STREETS BUT I NEVER WILL YIELD MY POINT I WILL WEAR MY VEIL SO LONG AS I HAVE A COMPLEXION WORTH PROTECTING AND SO LONG AS THERE ARE GENTLEMEN WORTH CUTTING
3433-20043-0006 THE BRIGHTON BRIDGE BATTERY IS A DELIGHTFUL PROMENADE ON A WARM SUMMER'S DAY IT IS SO SHADY BUT IT IS CLOSED I MAY SAY EVERY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY TO ACCOMMODATE THESE DETESTABLE PETS OF THE PUBLIC
3433-20043-0007 IT SEEMS AS MY BROTHER INFORMS ME THAT THE DROVERS FROM HUMANE CONSIDERATIONS ARE IN THE HABIT OF DRIVING THEIR CATTLE OVER TO BRIGHTON WHEN THE WEATHER IS PLEASANT
3433-20043-0008 AND BACK AGAIN ON THE NEXT DAY IN ORDER THAT THEIR HEALTH MAY BE IMPROVED BY THE SEA AIR WHICH BLOWS UP CHARLES RIVER NOW I THINK THAT WHEN THE COW TAKES PRECEDENCE OF THE LADY AND USURPS TO THE UTTER EXCLUSION OF THE LATTER
3433-20043-0009 THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PROMENADE IN CAMBRIDGE
3433-20043-0010 AND SO I TOLD MY BROTHER HE CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ADVISED ME NOT TO BEAR IT ANY LONGER BUT TO GO UPON BRIGHTON BRIDGE IN SPITE OF THE COWS AND ASSERT MY INDEPENDENCE I FOLLOWED HIS ADVICE AS I ALWAYS DO
3433-20043-0011 AND VIEWING THE HONEST SAILORS AS THEY PROMENADED UP AND DOWN THE STRING LADDERS AT THE COMMAND OF THEIR CAPTAINS MY FEARS WERE AROUSED BY A DISTANT COMMOTION I HASTILY TURNED AND LOOKED OVER THE RAILING INTO THE STREET
3433-20043-0012 URGED ON BY TWO FIENDISH BOYS AND A SAVAGE DOG WAS RAPIDLY APPROACHING ME FROM THE CAMBRIDGE SIDE WHAT SHOULD I DO I WAS TOO MUCH FATIGUED TO RUN AND I HAD NEVER LEARNED TO SWIM MY PLANS WERE HASTILY FORMED
3433-20043-0013 LEST THE GAY COLORS SHOULD STILL MORE ENRAGE THE WILD ANIMALS I JUMPED OVER THE OUTSIDE RAILING TOWARDS THE RIVER AND HUNG BY ONE ARM OVER THE ANGRY FLOOD DURING A MOMENT OF SPEECHLESS AGONY
3433-20043-0014 ON THEY CAME WITH LIGHTNING SPEED IN A WHIRLWIND OF DUST A RAPID SUCCESSION OF EARTHQUAKES BELLOWINGS GROANS AND ALL WAS OVER I WAS SAFE
3433-20043-0015 ON INSPECTION OF THE FOOTMARKS I FELT QUITE SURE THAT SOME OF THEM MUST HAVE APPROACHED WITHIN TEN YARDS OF ME
3433-20043-0016 AN HONEST TAR FROM ONE OF THE MEN OF WAR EMPLOYED IN UNLOADING COAL AT WILLARD'S WHARF TOOK THE CAPTAIN'S GIG
