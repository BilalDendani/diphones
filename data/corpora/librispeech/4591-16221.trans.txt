4591-16221-0000 A YOUNG LAWYER NAMED NATHAN GOODBODY WHOM HE KNEW BUT SLIGHTLY HE TOLD HIM AS MUCH OF THE CASE AS HE THOUGHT PROPER AND THEN GAVE HIM A NOTE TO THE PRISONER ADDRESSING HIM AS HARRY KING ARMED WITH THIS LETTER
4591-16221-0001 THE YOUNG LAWYER WAS SOON IN CLOSE CONSULTATION WITH HIS NEW CLIENT DESPITE NATHAN GOODBODY'S YOUTH HARRY WAS FAVORABLY IMPRESSED THE YOUNG MAN WAS SO INTERESTED SO ALERT SO CONFIDENT THAT ALL WOULD BE WELL
4591-16221-0002 HE SEEMED TO BELIEVE SO COMPLETELY THE STORY HARRY TOLD HIM AND TOOK CAREFUL NOTES OF IT SAYING HE WOULD PREPARE A BRIEF OF THE FACTS AND THE LAW AND THAT HARRY MIGHT SAFELY LEAVE EVERYTHING TO HIM
4591-16221-0003 YOU WERE WOUNDED IN THE HIP YOU SAY NATHAN GOODBODY QUESTIONED HIM WE MUST NOT NEGLECT THE SMALLEST ITEM THAT MAY HELP YOU FOR YOUR CASE NEEDS STRENGTHENING YOU SAY YOU WERE LAMED BY IT BUT YOU SEEM TO HAVE RECOVERED FROM THAT
4591-16221-0004 IS THERE NO SCAR THAT WILL NOT HELP ME MY COUSIN WAS WOUNDED ALSO BUT HIS WAS ONLY A FLESH WOUND FROM WHICH HE QUICKLY RECOVERED AND OF WHICH HE THOUGHT NOTHING
4591-16221-0005 BUT IT'S THE IRONY OF FATE THAT HE WAS MORE BADLY SCARRED BY IT THAN I HE WAS STRUCK BY A SPENT BULLET THAT TORE THE FLESH ONLY WHILE THE ONE THAT HIT ME WENT CLEANLY TO THE BONE AND SPLINTERED IT
4591-16221-0006 WHILE HE WAS BACK AT HIS POST IN A WEEK AND BOTH WOUNDS WERE IN THE SAME PLACE ON THE SAME SIDE FOR INSTANCE ON THE SAME SIDE YES BUT HIS WAS LOWER DOWN MINE ENTERED THE HIP HERE WHILE HE WAS STRUCK ABOUT HERE
4591-16221-0007 HARRY INDICATED THE PLACES WITH A TOUCH OF HIS FINGER I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT THE SCARS UNLESS FORCED TO DO SO FOR I WALK AS WELL NOW AS I EVER DID AND THAT WILL BE AGAINST ME THAT'S A PITY NOW ISN'T IT
4591-16221-0008 SUPPOSE YOU TRY TO GET BACK A LITTLE OF THE OLD LIMP HARRY LAUGHED NO I'LL WALK STRAIGHT BESIDES THEY'VE SEEN ME ON THE STREET AND EVEN IN MY FATHER'S BANK TOO BAD TOO BAD WHY DID YOU DO IT
4591-16221-0009 HOW COULD I GUESS THERE WOULD BE SUCH AN IMPOSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT UNTIL I SAW MISS BALLARD HERE IN THIS CELL I THOUGHT MY COUSIN DEAD WHY MY REASON FOR COMING HERE WAS TO CONFESS MY CRIME BUT THEY WON'T GIVE ME THE CHANCE THEY ARREST ME FIRST OF ALL FOR KILLING MYSELF
4591-16221-0010 NOW THAT I KNOW MY COUSIN LIVES I DON'T SEEM TO CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO ME EXCEPT FOR OTHERS BUT MAN YOU MUST PUT UP A FIGHT SUPPOSE YOUR COUSIN IS NO LONGER LIVING YOU DON'T WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN THE PENITENTIARY BECAUSE HE CAN'T BE FOUND
4591-16221-0011 I SEE IF HE IS LIVING THIS WHOLE TRIAL IS A FARCE AND IF HE IS NOT IT'S A TRAGEDY WE'LL NEVER LET IT BECOME A TRAGEDY I'LL PROMISE YOU THAT THE YOUNG MAN SPOKE WITH SMILING CONFIDENCE
4591-16221-0012 BUT WHEN HE REACHED HIS OFFICE AGAIN AND HAD CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM HIS MANNER CHANGED QUICKLY TO SERIOUSNESS AND DOUBT I DON'T KNOW HE SAID TO HIMSELF I DON'T KNOW IF THIS STORY CAN BE MADE TO SATISFY A JURY OR NOT A LITTLE SHADY
4591-16221-0013 TOO MUCH COINCIDENCE TO SUIT ME HE SAT DRUMMING WITH HIS FINGERS ON HIS DESK FOR A WHILE AND THEN ROSE AND TURNED TO HIS BOOKS I'LL HAVE A LITTLE LAW ON THIS CASE SOME POINT UPON WHICH WE CAN GO TO THE SUPREME COURT
4591-16221-0014 AND LONG INTO THE NIGHT NATHAN GOODBODY CONSULTED WITH HIS LIBRARY IN ANTICIPATION OF THE UNUSUAL PUBLIC INTEREST THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY DIRECTED THE SUMMONING OF TWENTY FIVE JURORS IN ADDITION TO THE TWENTY FIVE OF THE REGULAR PANEL
4591-16221-0015 ON THE DAY SET FOR THE TRIAL THE COURT ROOM WAS PACKED TO THE DOORS INSIDE THE BAR WERE THE LAWYERS AND THE OFFICERS OF THE COURT ELDER CRAIGMILE SAT BY MILTON HIBBARD
4591-16221-0016 IN THE FRONT SEATS JUST OUTSIDE THE BAR WERE THE FIFTY JURORS AND BACK OF THEM WERE THE LADIES WHO HAD COME EARLY OR WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN THE SEATS OF THEIR GENTLEMEN FRIENDS WHO HAD COME EARLY AND WHOSE GALLANTRY HAD MOMENTARILY GOTTEN THE BETTER OF THEIR JUDGMENT
4591-16221-0017 THE STILLNESS OF THE COURT ROOM LIKE THAT OF A CHURCH WAS SUDDENLY BROKEN BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE JUDGE A TALL SPARE MAN WITH GRAY HAIR AND A SERIOUS OUTLOOK UPON LIFE AS HE WALKED TOWARD HIS SEAT THE LAWYERS AND OFFICERS OF THE COURT
4591-16221-0018 ROSE AND STOOD UNTIL HE WAS SEATED THE CLERK OF THE COURT READ FROM A LARGE BOOK THE JOURNAL OF THE COURT OF THE PREVIOUS DAY AND THEN HANDED THE BOOK TO THE JUDGE TO BE SIGNED WHEN THIS CEREMONY WAS COMPLETED
4591-16221-0019 THE JUDGE TOOK UP THE COURT CALENDER AND SAID THE STATE
4591-16221-0020 AND TURNING TO THE LAWYERS ENGAGED IN THE CASE ADDED GENTLEMEN ARE YOU READY WE ARE READY ANSWERED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY BRING IN THE PRISONER WHEN HARRY ENTERED THE COURT ROOM IN CHARGE OF THE SHERIFF
4591-16221-0021 HE LOOKED NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR TO THE LEFT AND SAW NO ONE BEFORE HIM BUT HIS OWN COUNSEL WHO AROSE AND EXTENDED A FRIENDLY HAND AND LED HIM TO A SEAT BESIDE HIMSELF WITHIN THE BAR
4591-16221-0022 NATHAN GOODBODY THEN ROSE AND ADDRESSING THE COURT WITH AN AIR OF CONFIDENT MODESTY AS IF HE WERE BRINGING FORWARD A POINT SO STRONG AS TO REQUIRE NOTHING MORE THAN THE SIMPLE STATEMENT TO GIVE IT WEIGHT SAID IF THE COURT PLEASE THE DEFENSE IS READY
4591-16221-0023 BUT I HAVE NOTICED AS NO DOUBT THE COURT HAS NOTICED A DISTINGUISHED MEMBER OF THIS BAR SITTING WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AS THOUGH IT WERE INTENDED THAT HE SHOULD TAKE PART IN THE TRIAL OF THIS CASE AND I AM ADVISED THAT HE INTENDS TO DO SO
4591-16221-0024 I AM ALSO ADVISED THAT HE IS IN THE EMPLOY OF THE COMPLAINING WITNESS WHO SITS BESIDE HIM AND THAT HE HAS RECEIVED OR EXPECTS TO RECEIVE COMPENSATION FROM HIM FOR HIS SERVICES
4591-16221-0025 I DESIRE AT THE OUTSET OF THIS CASE TO RAISE A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER COUNSEL EMPLOYED AND PAID BY A PRIVATE PERSON HAS A RIGHT TO ASSIST IN THE PROSECUTION OF A CRIMINAL CAUSE
4591-16221-0026 I THEREFORE OBJECT TO THE APPEARANCE OF MISTER HIBBARD AS COUNSEL IN THIS CASE AND TO HIS TAKING ANY PART IN THIS TRIAL IF THE FACTS I HAVE STATED ARE QUESTIONED I WILL ASK ELDER CRAIGMILE TO BE SWORN
4591-16221-0027 THE COURT REPLIED I SHALL ASSUME THE FACTS TO BE AS STATED BY YOU UNLESS THE COUNSEL ON THE OTHER SIDE DISSENT FROM SUCH A STATEMENT CONSIDERING THE FACTS TO BE AS STATED YOUR OBJECTION RAISES A NOVEL QUESTION
4591-16221-0028 I DO NOT KNOW THAT THE SUPREME COURT OF THIS STATE HAS PASSED UPON THIS QUESTION I DO NOT THINK IT HAS BUT MY OBJECTION FINDS SUPPORT IN THE WELL ESTABLISHED RULE IN THIS COUNTRY
4591-16221-0029 HIS OBJECT LIKE THAT OF THE COURT SHOULD BE SIMPLE JUSTICE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY REPRESENTS THE PUBLIC INTEREST WHICH CAN NEVER BE PROMOTED BY THE CONVICTION OF THE INNOCENT
4591-16221-0030 AS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HIMSELF COULD NOT ACCEPT A FEE OR REWARD FROM PRIVATE PARTIES SO I URGE COUNSEL EMPLOYED TO ASSIST HIM MUST BE EQUALLY DISINTERESTED THE COURT CONSIDERS THE QUESTION AN INTERESTING ONE
4591-16221-0031 BUT THE PRACTICE IN THE PAST HAS BEEN AGAINST YOUR CONTENTION I WILL OVERRULE YOUR OBJECTION AND GIVE YOU AN EXCEPTION MISTER CLERK CALL A JURY
4591-16221-0032 UNTIL NEARLY THE ENTIRE PANEL OF FIFTY JURORS WAS EXHAUSTED IN THIS WAY TWO DAYS WERE SPENT WITH A RESULT THAT WHEN COUNSEL ON BOTH SIDES EXPRESSED THEMSELVES AS SATISFIED WITH THE JURY EVERY ONE IN THE COURT ROOM DOUBTED IT
4591-16221-0033 AS THE SHERIFF CONFIDED TO THE CLERK IT WAS AN EVEN BET THAT THE FIRST TWELVE MEN DRAWN WERE SAFER FOR BOTH SIDES THAN THE TWELVE MEN WHO FINALLY STOOD WITH UPLIFTED HANDS
4591-16221-0034 BEGAN TO GROW INTERESTED IN THESE DETAILS QUITE ASIDE FROM HIS OWN PART THEREIN HE WATCHED THE CLERK SHAKING THE BOX WONDERING WHY HE DID SO UNTIL HE SAW THE SLIPS OF PAPER BEING DRAWN FORTH ONE BY ONE FROM THE SMALL APERTURE ON THE TOP
4591-16221-0035 AND LISTENED WHILE THE NAME WRITTEN ON EACH WAS CALLED ALOUD SOME OF THE NAMES WERE FAMILIAR TO HIM AND IT SEEMED AS IF HE MUST TURN ABOUT AND SPEAK TO THE MEN WHO RESPONDED TO THEIR ROLL CALL SAYING HERE AS EACH ROSE IN HIS PLACE BEHIND HIM
4591-16221-0036 BUT HE RESISTED THE IMPULSE NEVER TURNING HIS HEAD AND ONLY GLANCING CURIOUSLY AT EACH MAN AS HE TOOK HIS SEAT IN THE JURY BOX AT THE ORDER OF THE JUDGE DURING ALL THESE PROCEEDINGS THE ELDER SAT LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM
4591-16221-0037 GLANCING AT THE PRISONER ONLY WHEN OBLIGED TO DO SO AND COLDLY AS AN OUTSIDER MIGHT DO THE TRIAL WAS TAKING MORE TIME THAN HE HAD THOUGHT POSSIBLE AND HE SAW NO REASON FOR SUCH LENGTHY TECHNICALITIES AND THE DELAY IN CALLING THE WITNESSES
4591-16221-0038 HIS AIR WAS WORN AND WEARY THE PRISONER SITTING BESIDE HIS COUNSEL HAD TAKEN LESS AND LESS INTEREST IN THE PROCEEDINGS AND THE CROWDS WHO HAD AT FIRST FILLED THE COURT ROOM HAD ALSO LOST INTEREST
4591-16221-0039 AND HAD DRIFTED OFF ABOUT THEIR OWN AFFAIRS UNTIL THE REAL BUSINESS OF THE TAKING OF TESTIMONY SHOULD COME ON TILL AT THE CLOSE OF THE SECOND DAY THE COURT ROOM WAS ALMOST EMPTY OF VISITORS THE PRISONER WAS GLAD TO SEE THEM GO
4591-16221-0040 SO MANY FAMILIAR FACES FACES FROM WHOM HE MIGHT REASONABLY EXPECT A SMILE OR A HANDSHAKE WERE IT POSSIBLE OR AT THE VERY LEAST A NOD OF RECOGNITION ALL WITH THEIR EYES FIXED ON HIM IN A BLANK GAZE OF ALOOFNESS OR SPECULATION
4591-16221-0041 HE FELT AS IF HIS SOUL MUST HAVE BEEN IN SOME WAY SEPARATED FROM HIS BODY AND THEN RETURNED TO IT TO FIND ALL THE WORLD GAZING AT THE PLACE WHERE HIS SOUL SHOULD BE WITHOUT SEEING THAT IT HAD RETURNED AND WAS CRAVING THEIR INTELLIGENT SUPPORT
4591-16221-0042 THE WHOLE SITUATION SEEMED TO HIM CRUELLY IMPOSSIBLE A SORT OF INSANE DELUSION ONLY ONE FACE NEVER FAILED HIM THAT OF BERTRAND BALLARD WHO SAT WHERE HE MIGHT NOW AND THEN MEET HIS EYE
4591-16221-0043 AND WHO NEVER LEFT THE COURT ROOM WHILE THE CASE WAS ON WHEN THE TIME ARRIVED FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF THE WITNESSES THE COURT ROOM AGAIN FILLED UP BUT HE NO LONGER LOOKED FOR FACES HE KNEW HE HELD HIMSELF STERNLY ALOOF
4591-16221-0044 AS IF HE FEARED HIS REASON MIGHT LEAVE HIM IF HE CONTINUED TO STRIVE AGAINST THOSE BAFFLING EYES WHO KNEW HIM AND DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY KNEW HIM BUT WHO LOOKED AT HIM AS IF TRYING TO PENETRATE A MASK WHEN HE WORE NO MASK
4591-16221-0045 OCCASIONALLY HIS COUNSEL TURNED TO HIM FOR BRIEF CONSULTATION IN WHICH HIS PART CONSISTED GENERALLY OF A NOD OR A SHAKE OF THE HEAD AS THE CASE MIGHT BE WHILE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS ADDRESSING THE JURY
4591-16221-0046 MILTON HIBBARD MOVED FORWARD AND TOOK THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S SEAT THEN FOLLOWED THE TESTIMONY OF THE BOYS NOW SHY LADS IN THEIR TEENS WHO HAD FOUND THE EVIDENCES OF A STRUGGLE AND POSSIBLE MURDER SO LONG BEFORE ON THE RIVER BLUFF
4591-16221-0047 UNDER THE ADROIT LEAD OF COUNSEL THEY TOLD EACH THE SAME STORY AND WERE EXCUSED CROSS EXAMINATION BOTH BOYS HAD IDENTIFIED THE HAT FOUND ON THE BLUFF AND TESTIFIED THAT THE BROWN STAIN WHICH NOW APPEARED SOMEWHAT FAINTLY
4591-16221-0048 HAD BEEN A BRIGHT RED AND HAD LOOKED LIKE BLOOD THEN BERTRAND BALLARD WAS CALLED AND THE QUESTIONS PUT TO HIM WERE MORE SEARCHING THOUGH THE MANNER OF THE EXAMINER WAS RESPECTFUL AND COURTEOUS
4591-16221-0049 HE STILL CONTRIVED TO LEAVE THE IMPRESSION ON THOSE IN THE COURT ROOM THAT HE HOPED TO DRAW OUT SOME FACT THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE DISCOVERY OF MATTERS MORE VITAL TO THE CASE THAN THE MERE DETAILS TO WHICH THE WITNESS TESTIFIED BUT BERTRAND BALLARD'S PROMPT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD ANSWERS
4591-16221-0050 AND HIS SIMPLE AND COURTEOUS MANNER WERE A FULL MATCH FOR THE ABLE LAWYER AND AFTER TWO HOURS OF EFFORT HE SUBSIDED THEN THE TESTIMONY OF THE OTHER WITNESSES WAS TAKEN EVEN TO THAT OF THE LITTLE HOUSEMAID WHO HAD BEEN IN THE FAMILY AT THE TIME
4591-16221-0051 AND WHO HAD SEEN PETER JUNIOR WEAR THE HAT DID SHE KNOW IT FOR HIS YES WHY DID SHE KNOW IT BECAUSE OF THE LITTLE BREAK IN THE STRAW ON THE EDGE OF THE BRIM BUT ANY MAN'S HAT MIGHT HAVE SUCH A BREAK
4591-16221-0052 WHAT WAS THERE ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR BREAK TO MAKE IT THE HAT OF PETER JUNIOR BECAUSE SHE HAD MADE IT HERSELF SHE HAD KNOCKED IT DOWN ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS BRUSHING UP IN THE FRONT HALL AND WHEN SHE HUNG IT UP AGAIN SHE HAD SEEN THE BREAK AND KNEW SHE HAD DONE IT
4591-16221-0053 AND THUS IN THE CAREFUL SCRUTINY OF SMALL THINGS RELATING TO THE HABITS LIFE AND MANNER OF DRESSING OF THE TWO YOUNG MEN MATTERS ABOUT WHICH NOBODY RAISED ANY QUESTION AND IN WHICH NO ONE EXCEPT THE EXAMINER TOOK ANY INTEREST
