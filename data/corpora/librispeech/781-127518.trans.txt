781-127518-0000 IT WAS LONGER THAN THE SQUIRE IMAGINED ERE WE WERE READY FOR THE SEA AND NONE OF OUR FIRST PLANS NOT EVEN DOCTOR LIVESEY'S OF KEEPING ME BESIDE HIM COULD BE CARRIED OUT AS WE INTENDED
781-127518-0001 THE DOCTOR HAD TO GO TO LONDON FOR A PHYSICIAN TO TAKE CHARGE OF HIS PRACTICE THE SQUIRE WAS HARD AT WORK AT BRISTOL AND I LIVED ON AT THE HALL UNDER THE CHARGE OF OLD REDRUTH THE GAMEKEEPER ALMOST A PRISONER
781-127518-0002 SITTING BY THE FIRE IN THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM I APPROACHED THAT ISLAND IN MY FANCY FROM EVERY POSSIBLE DIRECTION I EXPLORED EVERY ACRE OF ITS SURFACE
781-127518-0003 I CLIMBED A THOUSAND TIMES TO THAT TALL HILL THEY CALL THE SPY GLASS AND FROM THE TOP ENJOYED THE MOST WONDERFUL AND CHANGING PROSPECTS SOMETIMES THE ISLE WAS THICK WITH SAVAGES WITH WHOM WE FOUGHT
781-127518-0004 SOMETIMES FULL OF DANGEROUS ANIMALS THAT HUNTED US BUT IN ALL MY FANCIES NOTHING OCCURRED TO ME SO STRANGE AND TRAGIC AS OUR ACTUAL ADVENTURES SO THE WEEKS PASSED ON TILL ONE FINE DAY
781-127518-0005 THERE CAME A LETTER ADDRESSED TO DOCTOR LIVESEY WITH THIS ADDITION TO BE OPENED IN THE CASE OF HIS ABSENCE BY TOM REDRUTH OR YOUNG HAWKINS
781-127518-0006 OBEYING THIS ORDER WE FOUND OR RATHER I FOUND FOR THE GAMEKEEPER WAS A POOR HAND AT READING ANYTHING BUT PRINT THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT NEWS OLD ANCHOR INN
781-127518-0007 YOU NEVER IMAGINED A SWEETER SCHOONER A CHILD MIGHT SAIL HER TWO HUNDRED TONS NAME HISPANIOLA I GOT HER THROUGH MY OLD FRIEND BLANDLY WHO HAS PROVED HIMSELF THROUGHOUT THE MOST SURPRISING TRUMP
781-127518-0008 THE ADMIRABLE FELLOW LITERALLY SLAVED IN MY INTEREST AND SO I MAY SAY DID EVERYONE IN BRISTOL AS SOON AS THEY GOT WIND OF THE PORT WE SAILED FOR TREASURE I MEAN REDRUTH SAID I INTERRUPTING THE LETTER
781-127518-0009 DOCTOR LIVESEY WILL NOT LIKE THAT THE SQUIRE HAS BEEN TALKING AFTER ALL WELL WHO'S A BETTER RIGHT GROWLED THE GAMEKEEPER A PRETTY RUM GO IF SQUIRE AIN'T TO TALK FOR DOCTOR LIVESEY I SHOULD THINK
781-127518-0010 AT THAT I GAVE UP ALL ATTEMPTS AT COMMENTARY AND READ STRAIGHT ON BLANDLY HIMSELF FOUND THE HISPANIOLA AND BY THE MOST ADMIRABLE MANAGEMENT GOT HER FOR THE MEREST TRIFLE
781-127518-0011 THERE IS A CLASS OF MEN IN BRISTOL MONSTROUSLY PREJUDICED AGAINST BLANDLY THEY GO THE LENGTH OF DECLARING THAT THIS HONEST CREATURE WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR MONEY THAT THE HISPANIOLA BELONGED TO HIM AND THAT HE SOLD IT ME ABSURDLY HIGH
781-127518-0012 THE MOST TRANSPARENT CALUMNIES NONE OF THEM DARE HOWEVER TO DENY THE MERITS OF THE SHIP SO FAR THERE WAS NOT A HITCH THE WORKPEOPLE TO BE SURE RIGGERS AND WHAT NOT WERE MOST ANNOYINGLY SLOW BUT TIME CURED THAT
781-127518-0013 IT WAS THE CREW THAT TROUBLED ME I WISHED A ROUND SCORE OF MEN IN CASE OF NATIVES BUCCANEERS OR THE ODIOUS FRENCH AND I HAD THE WORRY OF THE DEUCE ITSELF TO FIND SO MUCH AS HALF A DOZEN
781-127518-0014 TILL THE MOST REMARKABLE STROKE OF FORTUNE BROUGHT ME THE VERY MAN THAT I REQUIRED I WAS STANDING ON THE DOCK WHEN BY THE MEREST ACCIDENT I FELL IN TALK WITH HIM I FOUND HE WAS AN OLD SAILOR KEPT A PUBLIC HOUSE
781-127518-0015 KNEW ALL THE SEAFARING MEN IN BRISTOL HAD LOST HIS HEALTH ASHORE AND WANTED A GOOD BERTH AS COOK TO GET TO SEA AGAIN HE HAD HOBBLED DOWN THERE THAT MORNING HE SAID TO GET A SMELL OF THE SALT I WAS MONSTROUSLY TOUCHED
781-127518-0016 SO WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN AND OUT OF PURE PITY I ENGAGED HIM ON THE SPOT TO BE SHIP'S COOK LONG JOHN SILVER HE IS CALLED AND HAS LOST A LEG BUT THAT I REGARDED AS A RECOMMENDATION SINCE HE LOST IT IN HIS COUNTRY'S SERVICE
781-127518-0017 UNDER THE IMMORTAL HAWKE HE HAS NO PENSION LIVESEY IMAGINE THE ABOMINABLE AGE WE LIVE IN WELL SIR I THOUGHT I HAD ONLY FOUND A COOK BUT IT WAS A CREW I HAD DISCOVERED BETWEEN SILVER AND MYSELF
781-127518-0018 WE GOT TOGETHER IN A FEW DAYS A COMPANY OF THE TOUGHEST OLD SALTS IMAGINABLE NOT PRETTY TO LOOK AT BUT FELLOWS BY THEIR FACES OF THE MOST INDOMITABLE SPIRIT I DECLARE WE COULD FIGHT A FRIGATE
781-127518-0019 LONG JOHN EVEN GOT RID OF TWO OUT OF THE SIX OR SEVEN I HAD ALREADY ENGAGED HE SHOWED ME IN A MOMENT THAT THEY WERE JUST THE SORT OF FRESH WATER SWABS WE HAD TO FEAR IN AN ADVENTURE OF IMPORTANCE
781-127518-0020 I AM IN THE MOST MAGNIFICENT HEALTH AND SPIRITS EATING LIKE A BULL SLEEPING LIKE A TREE YET I SHALL NOT ENJOY A MOMENT TILL I HEAR MY OLD TARPAULINS TRAMPING ROUND THE CAPSTAN SEAWARD HO HANG THE TREASURE
781-127518-0021 IT'S THE GLORY OF THE SEA THAT HAS TURNED MY HEAD SO NOW LIVESEY COME POST DO NOT LOSE AN HOUR IF YOU RESPECT ME LET YOUNG HAWKINS GO AT ONCE TO SEE HIS MOTHER WITH REDRUTH FOR A GUARD AND THEN BOTH COME FULL SPEED TO BRISTOL
781-127518-0022 POSTSCRIPT I DID NOT TELL YOU THAT BLANDLY WHO BY THE WAY IS TO SEND A CONSORT AFTER US IF WE DON'T TURN UP BY THE END OF AUGUST HAD FOUND AN ADMIRABLE FELLOW FOR SAILING MASTER A STIFF MAN WHICH I REGRET
781-127518-0023 BUT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS A TREASURE LONG JOHN SILVER UNEARTHED A VERY COMPETENT MAN FOR A MATE A MAN NAMED ARROW I HAVE A BOATSWAIN WHO PIPES LIVESEY SO THINGS SHALL GO MAN O' WAR FASHION ON BOARD THE GOOD SHIP HISPANIOLA
781-127518-0024 J T YOU CAN FANCY THE EXCITEMENT INTO WHICH THAT LETTER PUT ME I WAS HALF BESIDE MYSELF WITH GLEE
781-127518-0025 WHO COULD DO NOTHING BUT GRUMBLE AND LAMENT ANY OF THE UNDER GAMEKEEPERS WOULD GLADLY HAVE CHANGED PLACES WITH HIM BUT SUCH WAS NOT THE SQUIRE'S PLEASURE AND THE SQUIRE'S PLEASURE WAS LIKE LAW AMONG THEM ALL
781-127518-0026 NOBODY BUT OLD REDRUTH WOULD HAVE DARED SO MUCH AS EVEN TO GRUMBLE THE NEXT MORNING HE AND I SET OUT ON FOOT FOR THE ADMIRAL BENBOW AND THERE I FOUND MY MOTHER IN GOOD HEALTH AND SPIRITS
781-127518-0027 THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD SO LONG BEEN A CAUSE OF SO MUCH DISCOMFORT WAS GONE WHERE THE WICKED CEASE FROM TROUBLING THE SQUIRE HAD HAD EVERYTHING REPAIRED AND THE PUBLIC ROOMS AND THE SIGN REPAINTED
781-127518-0028 AND HAD ADDED SOME FURNITURE ABOVE ALL A BEAUTIFUL ARMCHAIR FOR MOTHER IN THE BAR HE HAD FOUND HER A BOY AS AN APPRENTICE ALSO SO THAT SHE SHOULD NOT WANT HELP WHILE I WAS GONE
781-127518-0029 AND NOW AT SIGHT OF THIS CLUMSY STRANGER WHO WAS TO STAY HERE IN MY PLACE BESIDE MY MOTHER I HAD MY FIRST ATTACK OF TEARS I AM AFRAID I LED THAT BOY A DOG'S LIFE FOR AS HE WAS NEW TO THE WORK
781-127518-0030 I HAD A HUNDRED OPPORTUNITIES OF SETTING HIM RIGHT AND PUTTING HIM DOWN AND I WAS NOT SLOW TO PROFIT BY THEM THE NIGHT PASSED AND THE NEXT DAY AFTER DINNER
781-127518-0031 AND THE DEAR OLD ADMIRAL BENBOW SINCE HE WAS REPAINTED NO LONGER QUITE SO DEAR ONE OF MY LAST THOUGHTS WAS OF THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD SO OFTEN STRODE ALONG THE BEACH WITH HIS COCKED HAT
781-127518-0032 HIS SABRE CUT CHEEK AND HIS OLD BRASS TELESCOPE NEXT MOMENT WE HAD TURNED THE CORNER AND MY HOME WAS OUT OF SIGHT THE MAIL PICKED US UP ABOUT DUSK AT THE ROYAL GEORGE ON THE HEATH
781-127518-0033 I WAS WEDGED IN BETWEEN REDRUTH AND A STOUT OLD GENTLEMAN AND IN SPITE OF THE SWIFT MOTION AND THE COLD NIGHT AIR I MUST HAVE DOZED A GREAT DEAL FROM THE VERY FIRST AND THEN SLEPT LIKE A LOG UP HILL AND DOWN DALE
781-127518-0034 THROUGH STAGE AFTER STAGE FOR WHEN I WAS AWAKENED AT LAST IT WAS BY A PUNCH IN THE RIBS AND I OPENED MY EYES TO FIND THAT WE WERE STANDING STILL BEFORE A LARGE BUILDING IN A CITY STREET
781-127518-0035 AND THAT THE DAY HAD ALREADY BROKEN A LONG TIME WHERE ARE WE I ASKED BRISTOL SAID TOM GET DOWN MISTER TRELAWNEY HAD TAKEN UP HIS RESIDENCE AT AN INN FAR DOWN THE DOCKS TO SUPERINTEND THE WORK UPON THE SCHOONER
781-127518-0036 LAY ALONG THE QUAYS AND BESIDE THE GREAT MULTITUDE OF SHIPS OF ALL SIZES AND RIGS AND NATIONS IN ONE SAILORS WERE SINGING AT THEIR WORK IN ANOTHER THERE WERE MEN ALOFT HIGH OVER MY HEAD
781-127518-0037 HANGING TO THREADS THAT SEEMED NO THICKER THAN A SPIDER'S THOUGH I HAD LIVED BY THE SHORE ALL MY LIFE I SEEMED NEVER TO HAVE BEEN NEAR THE SEA TILL THEN THE SMELL OF TAR AND SALT WAS SOMETHING NEW
781-127518-0038 I SAW THE MOST WONDERFUL FIGUREHEADS THAT HAD ALL BEEN FAR OVER THE OCEAN I SAW BESIDES MANY OLD SAILORS WITH RINGS IN THEIR EARS AND WHISKERS CURLED IN RINGLETS AND TARRY PIGTAILS
781-127518-0039 WHEN I HAD DONE BREAKFASTING THE SQUIRE GAVE ME A NOTE ADDRESSED TO JOHN SILVER AT THE SIGN OF THE SPY GLASS AND TOLD ME I SHOULD EASILY FIND THE PLACE BY FOLLOWING THE LINE OF THE DOCKS
781-127518-0040 AND KEEPING A BRIGHT LOOKOUT FOR A LITTLE TAVERN WITH A LARGE BRASS TELESCOPE FOR SIGN I SET OFF OVERJOYED AT THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SEE SOME MORE OF THE SHIPS AND SEAMEN
781-127518-0041 AND PICKED MY WAY AMONG A GREAT CROWD OF PEOPLE AND CARTS AND BALES FOR THE DOCK WAS NOW AT ITS BUSIEST UNTIL I FOUND THE TAVERN IN QUESTION IT WAS A BRIGHT ENOUGH LITTLE PLACE OF ENTERTAINMENT
781-127518-0042 IN SPITE OF CLOUDS OF TOBACCO SMOKE THE CUSTOMERS WERE MOSTLY SEAFARING MEN AND THEY TALKED SO LOUDLY THAT I HUNG AT THE DOOR ALMOST AFRAID TO ENTER AS I WAS WAITING A MAN CAME OUT OF A SIDE ROOM
781-127518-0043 AND AT A GLANCE I WAS SURE HE MUST BE LONG JOHN HIS LEFT LEG WAS CUT OFF CLOSE BY THE HIP AND UNDER THE LEFT SHOULDER HE CARRIED A CRUTCH WHICH HE MANAGED WITH WONDERFUL DEXTERITY HOPPING ABOUT UPON IT LIKE A BIRD
781-127518-0044 WITH A MERRY WORD OR A SLAP ON THE SHOULDER FOR THE MORE FAVOURED OF HIS GUESTS NOW TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH FROM THE VERY FIRST MENTION OF LONG JOHN IN SQUIRE TRELAWNEY'S LETTER I HAD TAKEN A FEAR IN MY MIND
781-127518-0045 THAT HE MIGHT PROVE TO BE THE VERY ONE LEGGED SAILOR WHOM I HAD WATCHED FOR SO LONG AT THE OLD BENBOW BUT ONE LOOK AT THE MAN BEFORE ME WAS ENOUGH I HAD SEEN THE CAPTAIN AND BLACK DOG AND THE BLIND MAN PEW
781-127518-0046 AND I THOUGHT I KNEW WHAT A BUCCANEER WAS LIKE A VERY DIFFERENT CREATURE ACCORDING TO ME FROM THIS CLEAN AND PLEASANT TEMPERED LANDLORD I PLUCKED UP COURAGE AT ONCE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD AND WALKED RIGHT UP TO THE MAN WHERE HE STOOD
781-127518-0047 PROPPED ON HIS CRUTCH TALKING TO A CUSTOMER MISTER SILVER SIR I ASKED HOLDING OUT THE NOTE YES MY LAD SAID HE SUCH IS MY NAME TO BE SURE AND WHO MAY YOU BE AND THEN AS HE SAW THE SQUIRE'S LETTER
781-127518-0048 HE SEEMED TO ME TO GIVE SOMETHING ALMOST LIKE A START OH SAID HE QUITE LOUD AND OFFERING HIS HAND I SEE YOU ARE OUR NEW CABIN BOY PLEASED I AM TO SEE YOU
781-127518-0049 AND HE TOOK MY HAND IN HIS LARGE FIRM GRASP JUST THEN ONE OF THE CUSTOMERS AT THE FAR SIDE ROSE SUDDENLY AND MADE FOR THE DOOR IT WAS CLOSE BY HIM AND HE WAS OUT IN THE STREET IN A MOMENT
781-127518-0050 BUT HIS HURRY HAD ATTRACTED MY NOTICE AND I RECOGNIZED HIM AT GLANCE IT WAS THE TALLOW FACED MAN WANTING TWO FINGERS WHO HAD COME FIRST TO THE ADMIRAL BENBOW OH I CRIED STOP HIM IT'S BLACK DOG
