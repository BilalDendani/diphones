3738-164927-0000 THAT WHEN SHARRKAN SAW THE MOSLEMS IN CONQUERED PLIGHT AND THE CHAMBERLAIN UPON THE BRINK OF RETREAT AND FLIGHT

3738-164927-0005 SEE MY MOTHER'S CRAFT VERILY IT DISPENSETH WITH SWORDS AND HER ASPECT STANDETH
3738-164927-0006 SHOUTING OUT THEIR PROFESSIONS OF IMPIETY AND HERESIES AND BLASPHEMING THE LORD OF ALL CREATURES WHEN THE CHAMBERLAIN SAW THE SALLY HE SAID BEHOLD THE GREEK IS UPON US AND THEY SURELY HAVE LEARNED THAT OUR SULTAN IS FAR AWAY
3738-164927-0007 THEREUPON THE MOSLEMS CRIED OUT ALLAHO AKBAR AND THE BELIEVER IN THE ONE GOD SHOUTED HIS SLOGAN
3738-164927-0008 AND WHIRLED THE MILL WHEELS OF FIGHT WITH CUTTING AND THRUSTING IN MAIN AND MIGHT SCYMITARS AND SPEARS PLAYED SORE AND THE PLAINS AND VALLEYS WERE SWAMPED WITH GORE
3738-164927-0009 THE PRIESTS AND MONKS PRIESTED IT TIGHT GIRDING THEIR GIRDLES AND UPLIFTING THE CRUCIFIXES WHILE THE MOSLEM SHOUTED OUT THE PROFESSIONS OF THE REQUITING KING
3738-164927-0010 TRUSTING THEE ALLAH WOULD HELP THEM TO VICTORY AND HOST WAS MINGLED WITH HOST

3738-164927-0014 AND HE IN TURN GAVE THE PRINCE JOY OF HIS TIMELY SUCCOUR AND HIS GAINING THE DAY THEREAT THE MOSLEMS WERE GLAD AND THEIR HEARTS WERE HEARTENED SO THEY RUSHED UPON THEIR ENEMIES AND DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO ALLAH IN THEIR FIGHT FOR THE FAITH
3738-164927-0015 AND STAYED THEIR HANDS FROM SLAUGHTER WHILST KING AFRIDUN WENT UP TO CONSULT KING HARDUB OF GREECE FOR THE TWO KINGS STOOD ONE AT THE HEAD OF EACH WING
3738-164927-0016 NOW THERE WAS WITH THEM ALSO A FAMOUS CAVALIER LAWIYA HIGHS WHO COMMANDED THE CENTRE AND THEY DREW OUT IN BATTLE ARRAY BUT INDEED THEY WERE FULL OF ALARM AND AFFRAY
