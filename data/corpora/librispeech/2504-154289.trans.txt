2504-154289-0000 AND TRIED TO BROWSE ON THE MARINE PLANTS AND DRY REEDS THEY FOUND THERE NAUSEOUS TO THE TASTE AS THEY MUST HAVE BEEN AS SOON AS THE WHOLE PARTY WERE ENSCONCED IN THE ROUKAH
2504-154289-0001 A FEW WORDS OF WHICH WERE INTELLIGIBLE TO GLENARVAN THALCAVE SPOKE CALMLY BUT THE LIVELY FRENCHMAN GESTICULATED ENOUGH FOR BOTH AFTER A LITTLE THALCAVE SAT SILENT AND FOLDED HIS ARMS WHAT DOES HE SAY ASKED GLENARVAN I FANCIED HE WAS ADVISING US TO SEPARATE
2504-154289-0002 YES INTO TWO PARTIES THOSE OF US WHOSE HORSES ARE SO DONE OUT WITH FATIGUE AND THIRST THAT THEY CAN SCARCELY DRAG ONE LEG AFTER THE OTHER
2504-154289-0003 WHILE THE OTHERS WHOSE STEEDS ARE FRESHER ARE TO PUSH ON IN ADVANCE TOWARD THE RIVER GUAMINI WHICH THROWS ITSELF INTO LAKE SAN LUCAS ABOUT THIRTY ONE MILES OFF IF THERE SHOULD BE WATER ENOUGH IN THE RIVER THEY ARE TO WAIT ON THE BANKS TILL THEIR COMPANIONS REACH THEM
2504-154289-0004 AND WHAT WILL WE DO THEN ASKED AUSTIN
2504-154289-0005 IT IS WISE COUNSEL AND WE WILL ACT UPON IT WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME MY HORSE IS IN TOLERABLE GOOD TRIM AND I VOLUNTEER TO ACCOMPANY THALCAVE OH MY LORD TAKE ME SAID ROBERT AS IF IT WERE A QUESTION OF SOME PLEASURE PARTY
2504-154289-0006 BUT WOULD YOU BE ABLE FOR IT MY BOY OH I HAVE A FINE BEAST
2504-154289-0007 PLEASE MY LORD TO TAKE ME COME THEN MY BOY SAID GLENARVAN DELIGHTED NOT TO LEAVE ROBERT BEHIND
2504-154289-0008 NEITHER MULRADY NOR WILSON NOR MYSELF WOULD BE ABLE TO REJOIN THALCAVE AT THE GIVEN RENDEZVOUS BUT WE WILL PUT OURSELVES UNDER THE BANNER OF THE BRAVE JACQUES PAGANEL WITH PERFECT CONFIDENCE I RESIGN MYSELF SAID THE GEOGRAPHER MUCH FLATTERED AT HAVING SUPREME COMMAND
2504-154289-0009 OH YOU INSUFFERABLE MAJOR IT WOULD SERVE YOU RIGHT REPLIED PAGANEL LAUGHING
2504-154289-0010 I SUPPOSE REPLIED GLENARVAN
2504-154289-0011 THE SUPPER WAS NOT VERY REVIVING WITHOUT DRINK OF ANY KIND
2504-154289-0012 BUT PAGANEL DREAMED OF WATER ALL NIGHT OF TORRENTS AND CASCADES AND RIVERS AND PONDS AND STREAMS AND BROOKS IN FACT HE HAD A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE NEXT MORNING AT SIX O'CLOCK
2504-154289-0013 AND DRUNK WITH MORE AVIDITY THAN SATISFACTION
2504-154289-0014 THE THREE TRAVELERS THEN JUMPED INTO THEIR SADDLES AND SET OFF SHOUTING AU REVOIR TO THEIR COMPANIONS DON'T COME BACK WHATEVER YOU DO CALLED PAGANEL AFTER THEM THE DESERTIO DE LAS SALINAS
2504-154289-0015 COVERED WITH STUNTED TREES NOT ABOVE TEN FEET HIGH AND SMALL MIMOSAS WHICH THE INDIANS CALL CURRA MAMMEL
2504-154289-0016 A BUSHY SHRUB RICH IN SODA HERE AND THERE LARGE SPACES WERE COVERED WITH SALT
2504-154289-0017 TOWARD WHICH THE TRAVELERS MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE TO BETAKE THEMSELVES SHOULD THE GUAMINI DISAPPOINT THEIR HOPES THE LANDSCAPE WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT
2504-154289-0018 AND THIS WAS WHY THALCAVE THOUGHT IT BEST TO GO FIRST TO GUAMINI AS IT WAS NOT ONLY MUCH NEARER BUT ALSO ON THE DIRECT LINE OF ROUTE THE THREE HORSES WENT FORWARD MIGHT AND MAIN AS IF INSTINCTIVELY KNOWING WHITHER THEY WERE BOUND
2504-154289-0019 HIS LOUD JOYOUS NEIGHING SEEMING TO BODE SUCCESS TO THE SEARCH THE HORSES OF GLENARVAN AND ROBERT THOUGH NOT SO LIGHT FOOTED FELT THE SPUR OF HIS EXAMPLE AND FOLLOWED HIM BRAVELY THALCAVE INSPIRITED HIS COMPANIONS AS MUCH AS THAOUKA DID HIS FOUR FOOTED BRETHREN
2504-154289-0020 HE SAT MOTIONLESS IN THE SADDLE BUT OFTEN TURNED HIS HEAD TO LOOK AT ROBERT
2504-154289-0021 BRAVO ROBERT SAID GLENARVAN THALCAVE IS EVIDENTLY CONGRATULATING YOU MY BOY AND PAYING YOU COMPLIMENTS
2504-154289-0022 I CAN HOLD FIRM ON THAT'S ALL REPLIED ROBERT BLUSHING WITH PLEASURE AT SUCH AN ENCOMIUM
2504-154289-0023 WHAT WOULD PAPA SAY TO THAT SAID ROBERT LAUGHING HE WANTS ME TO BE A SAILOR THE ONE WON'T HINDER THE OTHER IF ALL CAVALIERS WOULDN'T MAKE GOOD SAILORS THERE IS NO REASON WHY ALL SAILORS SHOULD NOT MAKE GOOD HORSEMEN TO KEEP ONE'S FOOTING ON THE YARDS MUST TEACH A MAN TO HOLD ON FIRM
2504-154289-0024 THAT'S EASILY ACQUIRED INDEED IT COMES NATURALLY POOR FATHER SAID ROBERT
2504-154289-0025 YOU LOVE HIM VERY MUCH ROBERT YES MY LORD DEARLY
2504-154289-0026 AND BETTER STILL OF LOVING WORDS AND CARESSES AH IF YOU KNEW HIM YOU WOULD LOVE HIM TOO MARY IS MOST LIKE HIM HE HAS A SOFT VOICE LIKE HERS
2504-154289-0027 YES ROBERT VERY STRANGE I SEE HIM STILL THE BOY WENT ON AS IF SPEAKING TO HIMSELF GOOD BRAVE PAPA HE PUT ME TO SLEEP ON HIS KNEE CROONING AN OLD SCOTCH BALLAD ABOUT THE LOCHS OF OUR COUNTRY THE TIME SOMETIMES COMES BACK TO ME
2504-154289-0028 BUT VERY CONFUSED LIKE SO IT DOES TO MARY TOO AH MY LORD HOW WE LOVED HIM WELL I DO THINK ONE NEEDS TO BE LITTLE TO LOVE ONE'S FATHER LIKE THAT YES AND TO BE GROWN UP MY CHILD TO VENERATE HIM REPLIED GLENARVAN
2504-154289-0029 DEEPLY TOUCHED BY THE BOY'S GENUINE AFFECTION DURING THIS CONVERSATION THE HORSES HAD BEEN SLACKENING SPEED AND WERE ONLY WALKING NOW
2504-154289-0030 YES WE'LL FIND HIM WAS GLENARVAN'S REPLY
2504-154289-0031 THALCAVE IS A BRAVE INDIAN ISN'T HE SAID THE BOY THAT INDEED HE IS
2504-154289-0032 WHAT IS IT AND THEN I WILL TELL YOU THAT ALL THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE WITH YOU ARE BRAVE LADY HELENA WHOM I LOVE SO AND THE MAJOR WITH HIS CALM MANNER AND CAPTAIN MANGLES AND MONSIEUR PAGANEL AND ALL THE SAILORS ON THE DUNCAN HOW COURAGEOUS AND DEVOTED THEY ARE
2504-154289-0033 YES MY BOY I KNOW THAT REPLIED GLENARVAN
2504-154289-0034 NO MOST CERTAINLY I DON'T KNOW THAT WELL IT IS TIME YOU DID MY LORD SAID THE BOY SEIZING HIS LORDSHIP'S HAND AND COVERING IT WITH KISSES GLENARVAN SHOOK HIS HEAD BUT SAID NO MORE AS A GESTURE FROM THALCAVE MADE THEM SPUR ON THEIR HORSES AND HURRY FORWARD
2504-154289-0035 BUT IT WAS SOON EVIDENT THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THAOUKA THE WEARIED ANIMALS COULD NOT GO QUICKER THAN A WALKING PACE AT NOON THEY WERE OBLIGED TO LET THEM REST FOR AN HOUR
2504-154289-0036 A POOR BURNT UP SORT OF LUCERNE THAT GREW THERE GLENARVAN BEGAN TO BE UNEASY TOKENS OF STERILITY WERE NOT THE LEAST ON THE DECREASE
2504-154289-0037 THALCAVE SAID NOTHING THINKING PROBABLY THAT IT WOULD BE TIME ENOUGH TO DESPAIR IF THE GUAMINI SHOULD BE DRIED UP
2504-154289-0038 SPUR AND WHIP HAD BOTH TO BE EMPLOYED TO INDUCE THE POOR ANIMALS TO RESUME THE ROUTE AND THEN THEY ONLY CREPT ALONG FOR THEIR STRENGTH WAS GONE THAOUKA INDEED COULD HAVE GALLOPED SWIFTLY ENOUGH AND REACHED THE RIO IN A FEW HOURS
2504-154289-0039 IT WAS HARD WORK HOWEVER TO GET THE ANIMAL TO CONSENT TO WALK QUIETLY HE KICKED AND REARED AND NEIGHED VIOLENTLY
2504-154289-0040 THE INTELLIGENT ANIMAL FELT HUMIDITY IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND DRANK IT IN WITH FRENZY
2504-154289-0041 THE PATAGONIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE HIM NOW WATER WAS NOT FAR OFF THE TWO OTHER HORSES SEEMED TO CATCH THEIR COMRADE'S MEANING AND INSPIRED BY HIS EXAMPLE MADE A LAST EFFORT AND GALLOPED FORWARD AFTER THE INDIAN
2504-154289-0042 ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK A WHITE LINE APPEARED IN A DIP OF THE ROAD AND SEEMED TO TREMBLE IN THE SUNLIGHT WATER EXCLAIMED GLENARVAN
2504-154289-0043 THEIR MASTERS HAD TO GO ON TOO WHETHER THEY WOULD OR NOT BUT THEY WERE SO REJOICED AT BEING ABLE TO QUENCH THEIR THIRST THAT THIS COMPULSORY BATH WAS NO GRIEVANCE OH HOW DELICIOUS THIS IS EXCLAIMED ROBERT TAKING A DEEP DRAUGHT DRINK MODERATELY MY BOY SAID GLENARVAN BUT HE DID NOT SET THE EXAMPLE
2504-154289-0044 THALCAVE DRANK VERY QUIETLY WITHOUT HURRYING HIMSELF TAKING SMALL GULPS BUT AS LONG AS A LAZO AS THE PATAGONIANS SAY HE SEEMED AS IF HE WERE NEVER GOING TO LEAVE OFF AND REALLY THERE WAS SOME DANGER OF HIS SWALLOWING UP THE WHOLE RIVER AT LAST GLENARVAN SAID
2504-154289-0045 THAT IS TO SAY IF THALCAVE LEAVES ANY FOR THEM BUT COULDN'T WE GO TO MEET THEM IT WOULD SPARE THEM SEVERAL HOURS SUFFERING AND ANXIETY YOU'RE RIGHT MY BOY BUT HOW COULD WE CARRY THEM THIS WATER THE LEATHER BOTTLES WERE LEFT WITH WILSON NO IT IS BETTER FOR US TO WAIT FOR THEM AS WE AGREED
2504-154289-0046 HE HAD BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO DISCOVER ON THE BANKS OF THE RIO A RAMADA A SORT OF ENCLOSURE WHICH HAD SERVED AS A FOLD FOR FLOCKS AND WAS SHUT IN ON THREE SIDES
2504-154289-0047 AND NONE OF THALCAVE'S COMPANIONS HAD MUCH SOLICITUDE ON THAT SCORE ACCORDINGLY THEY TOOK POSSESSION AT ONCE AND STRETCHED THEMSELVES AT FULL LENGTH ON THE GROUND IN THE BRIGHT SUNSHINE TO DRY THEIR DRIPPING GARMENTS WELL NOW WE'VE SECURED A LODGING WE MUST THINK OF SUPPER SAID GLENARVAN
2504-154289-0048 OUR FRIENDS MUST NOT HAVE REASON TO COMPLAIN OF THE COURIERS THEY SENT TO PRECEDE THEM AND IF I AM NOT MUCH MISTAKEN THEY WILL BE VERY SATISFIED IT STRIKES ME THAT AN HOUR'S SHOOTING WON'T BE LOST TIME ARE YOU READY ROBERT YES MY LORD REPLIED THE BOY STANDING UP GUN IN HAND
2504-154289-0049 A SORT OF PARTRIDGE PECULIAR TO THE PAMPAS CALLED TINAMOUS BLACK WOOD HENS
2504-154289-0050 YELLOW RAYS AND WATERFOWL WITH MAGNIFICENT GREEN PLUMAGE ROSE IN COVEYS NO QUADRUPEDS HOWEVER WERE VISIBLE BUT THALCAVE POINTED TO THE LONG GRASS AND THICK BRUSHWOOD AND GAVE HIS FRIENDS TO UNDERSTAND THEY WERE LYING THERE IN CONCEALMENT
2504-154289-0051 DISDAINING THE FEATHERED TRIBES WHEN MORE SUBSTANTIAL GAME WAS AT HAND THE HUNTERS FIRST SHOTS WERE FIRED INTO THE UNDERWOOD INSTANTLY THERE ROSE BY THE HUNDRED ROEBUCKS AND GUANACOS
2504-154289-0052 THOUGH IN AN ALIMENTARY POINT OF VIEW NOTHING BETTER COULD BE WISHED A DOZEN OF RED PARTRIDGES AND RAYS WERE SPEEDILY BROUGHT DOWN
2504-154289-0053 A PACHYDERMATOUS ANIMAL THE FLESH OF WHICH IS EXCELLENT EATING IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR THE HUNTERS HAD ALL THE GAME THEY REQUIRED
2504-154289-0054 A SORT OF TATOU COVERED WITH A HARD BONY SHELL IN MOVABLE PIECES AND MEASURING A FOOT AND A HALF LONG IT WAS VERY FAT AND WOULD MAKE AN EXCELLENT DISH THE PATAGONIAN SAID
2504-154289-0055 THALCAVE DID HIS PART BY CAPTURING A NANDOU A SPECIES OF OSTRICH REMARKABLE FOR ITS EXTREME SWIFTNESS THERE COULD BE NO ENTRAPPING SUCH AN ANIMAL AND THE INDIAN DID NOT ATTEMPT IT HE URGED THAOUKA TO A GALLOP AND MADE A DIRECT ATTACK
2504-154289-0056 KNOWING THAT IF THE FIRST AIM MISSED THE NANDOU WOULD SOON TIRE OUT HORSE AND RIDER
2504-154289-0057 THE MOMENT THEREFORE THAT THALCAVE GOT TO A RIGHT DISTANCE
2504-154289-0058 IN A FEW SECONDS IT LAY FLAT ON THE GROUND THE INDIAN HAD NOT MADE HIS CAPTURE FOR THE MERE PLEASURE AND GLORY OF SUCH A NOVEL CHASE THE FLESH OF THE NANDOU IS HIGHLY ESTEEMED
2504-154289-0059 THEY RETURNED TO THE RAMADA BRINGING BACK THE STRING OF PARTRIDGES THE OSTRICH THE PECCARY AND THE ARMADILLO
2504-154289-0060 HE CARRIES HIS COOKING APPARATUS WITH HIM AND ALL THAT HAD TO BE DONE WAS TO PLACE HIM IN HIS OWN SHELL OVER THE GLOWING EMBERS THE SUBSTANTIAL DISHES WERE RESERVED FOR THE NIGHT COMERS AND THE THREE HUNTERS CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH DEVOURING THE PARTRIDGES AND WASHED DOWN THEIR MEAL WITH CLEAR FRESH WATER
2504-154289-0061 WHICH WAS PRONOUNCED SUPERIOR TO ALL THE PORTER IN THE WORLD EVEN TO THE FAMOUS HIGHLAND USQUEBAUGH OR WHISKY
