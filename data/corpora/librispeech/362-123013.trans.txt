362-123013-0000 THERE HAD BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF RAIN AND NOW THE WIND WAS VERY HIGH AND BLEW THE DRY LEAVES ACROSS THE ROAD IN A SHOWER WE WENT ALONG MERRILY TILL WE CAME TO THE TOLL BAR AND THE LOW WOODEN BRIDGE
362-123013-0001 THE RIVER BANKS WERE RATHER HIGH AND THE BRIDGE INSTEAD OF RISING WENT ACROSS JUST LEVEL SO THAT IN THE MIDDLE IF THE RIVER WAS FULL THE WATER WOULD BE NEARLY UP TO THE WOODWORK AND PLANKS
362-123013-0002 BUT AS THE MASTER'S BUSINESS ENGAGED HIM A LONG TIME WE DID NOT START FOR HOME TILL RATHER LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THE WIND WAS THEN MUCH HIGHER AND I HEARD THE MASTER SAY TO JOHN THAT HE HAD NEVER BEEN OUT IN SUCH A STORM
362-123013-0003 AND SO I THOUGHT AS WE WENT ALONG THE SKIRTS OF A WOOD WHERE THE GREAT BRANCHES WERE SWAYING ABOUT LIKE TWIGS AND THE RUSHING SOUND WAS TERRIBLE I WISH WE WERE WELL OUT OF THIS WOOD SAID MY MASTER
362-123013-0004 YES SIR SAID JOHN IT WOULD BE RATHER AWKWARD IF ONE OF THESE BRANCHES CAME DOWN UPON US THE WORDS WERE SCARCELY OUT OF HIS MOUTH
362-123013-0005 WHEN THERE WAS A GROAN AND A CRACK AND A SPLITTING SOUND AND TEARING CRASHING DOWN AMONG THE OTHER TREES CAME AN OAK TORN UP BY THE ROOTS AND IT FELL RIGHT ACROSS THE ROAD JUST BEFORE US
362-123013-0006 I WILL NEVER SAY I WAS NOT FRIGHTENED FOR I WAS I STOPPED STILL AND I BELIEVE I TREMBLED OF COURSE I DID NOT TURN ROUND OR RUN AWAY I WAS NOT BROUGHT UP TO THAT JOHN JUMPED OUT
362-123013-0007 AND WAS IN A MOMENT AT MY HEAD THAT WAS A VERY NEAR TOUCH SAID MY MASTER WHAT'S TO BE DONE NOW WELL SIR WE CAN'T DRIVE OVER THAT TREE NOR YET GET ROUND IT
362-123013-0008 SO BACK WE WENT AND ROUND BY THE CROSSROADS BUT BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THE BRIDGE IT WAS VERY NEARLY DARK WE COULD JUST SEE THAT THE WATER WAS OVER THE MIDDLE OF IT
362-123013-0009 BUT AS THAT HAPPENED SOMETIMES WHEN THE FLOODS WERE OUT MASTER DID NOT STOP WE WERE GOING ALONG AT A GOOD PACE BUT THE MOMENT MY FEET TOUCHED THE FIRST PART OF THE BRIDGE I FELT SURE THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG I DARE NOT GO FORWARD
362-123013-0010 AND I MADE A DEAD STOP GO ON BEAUTY SAID MY MASTER AND HE GAVE ME A TOUCH WITH THE WHIP BUT I DARE NOT STIR HE GAVE ME A SHARP CUT I JUMPED BUT I DARE NOT GO FORWARD
362-123013-0011 THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG SIR SAID JOHN AND HE SPRANG OUT OF THE DOG CART AND CAME TO MY HEAD AND LOOKED ALL ABOUT HE TRIED TO LEAD ME FORWARD COME ON BEAUTY WHAT'S THE MATTER
362-123013-0012 OF COURSE I COULD NOT TELL HIM BUT I KNEW VERY WELL THAT THE BRIDGE WAS NOT SAFE
362-123013-0013 THANK GOD SAID MY MASTER YOU BEAUTY SAID JOHN AND TOOK THE BRIDLE AND GENTLY TURNED ME ROUND TO THE RIGHT HAND ROAD BY THE RIVER SIDE THE SUN HAD SET SOME TIME
362-123013-0014 THE WIND SEEMED TO HAVE LULLED OFF AFTER THAT FURIOUS BLAST WHICH TORE UP THE TREE IT GREW DARKER AND DARKER STILLER AND STILLER
362-123013-0015 I TROTTED QUIETLY ALONG THE WHEELS HARDLY MAKING A SOUND ON THE SOFT ROAD FOR A GOOD WHILE NEITHER MASTER NOR JOHN SPOKE AND THEN MASTER BEGAN IN A SERIOUS VOICE
362-123013-0016 I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND MUCH OF WHAT THEY SAID BUT I FOUND THEY THOUGHT IF I HAD GONE ON AS THE MASTER WANTED ME MOST LIKELY THE BRIDGE WOULD HAVE GIVEN WAY UNDER US AND HORSE CHAISE MASTER
362-123013-0017 AND AS THE CURRENT WAS FLOWING VERY STRONGLY AND THERE WAS NO LIGHT AND NO HELP AT HAND
362-123013-0018 I AM SURE HE MAKES FRIENDS OF THEM IF EVER A MAN DID AT LAST WE CAME TO THE PARK GATES AND FOUND THE GARDENER LOOKING OUT FOR US HE SAID THAT MISTRESS HAD BEEN IN A DREADFUL WAY EVER SINCE DARK
362-123013-0019 FEARING SOME ACCIDENT HAD HAPPENED AND THAT SHE HAD SENT JAMES OFF ON JUSTICE THE ROAN COB TOWARD THE WOODEN BRIDGE TO MAKE INQUIRY AFTER US WE SAW A LIGHT AT THE HALL DOOR AND AT THE UPPER WINDOWS
362-123013-0020 AND AS WE CAME UP MISTRESS RAN OUT SAYING ARE YOU REALLY SAFE MY DEAR OH I HAVE BEEN SO ANXIOUS
362-123013-0021 I HEARD NO MORE AS THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND JOHN TOOK ME TO THE STABLE OH WHAT A GOOD SUPPER HE GAVE ME THAT NIGHT A GOOD BRAN MASH AND SOME CRUSHED BEANS WITH MY OATS AND SUCH A THICK BED OF STRAW
