7492-105653-0000 JAMES WHOM YEARS HAD NOT YET TAUGHT DISTRUST OR CAUTION WAS SEDUCED TO BELIEVE THE STORY OF PERKIN'S BIRTH AND ADVENTURES AND HE CARRIED HIS CONFIDENCE SO FAR AS TO GIVE HIM IN MARRIAGE THE LADY CATHARINE GORDON
7492-105653-0001 ATTENDED BY SOME OF THE BORDERERS AND HE CARRIED PERKIN ALONG WITH HIM IN HOPES THAT THE APPEARANCE OF THE PRETENDED PRINCE MIGHT RAISE AN INSURRECTION IN THE NORTHERN COUNTIES PERKIN HIMSELF DISPERSED A MANIFESTO
7492-105653-0002 IN WHICH HE SET FORTH HIS OWN STORY AND CRAVED THE ASSISTANCE OF ALL HIS SUBJECTS IN EXPELLING THE USURPER WHOSE TYRANNY AND MALADMINISTRATION WHOSE DEPRESSION OF THE NOBILITY BY THE ELEVATION OF MEAN PERSONS WHOSE OPPRESSION OF THE PEOPLE
7492-105653-0003 BY MULTIPLIED IMPOSITIONS AND VEXATIONS HAD JUSTLY HE SAID RENDERED HIM ODIOUS TO ALL MEN BUT PERKIN'S PRETENSIONS ATTENDED WITH REPEATED DISAPPOINTMENTS
7492-105653-0004 WERE NOW BECOME STALE IN THE EYES EVEN OF THE POPULACE AND THE HOSTILE DISPOSITIONS WHICH SUBSISTED BETWEEN THE KINGDOMS RENDERED A PRINCE SUPPORTED BY THE SCOTS BUT AN UNWELCOME PRESENT TO THE ENGLISH NATION
7492-105653-0005 THE RAVAGES ALSO COMMITTED BY THE BORDERERS ACCUSTOMED TO LICENSE AND DISORDER STRUCK A TERROR INTO ALL MEN AND MADE THE PEOPLE PREPARE RATHER FOR REPELLING THE INVADERS
7492-105653-0006 THAN FOR JOINING THEM PERKIN THAT HE MIGHT SUPPORT HIS PRETENSIONS TO ROYAL BIRTH FEIGNED GREAT COMPASSION FOR THE MISERY OF HIS PLUNDERED SUBJECTS AND PUBLICLY REMONSTRATED WITH HIS ALLY AGAINST THE DEPREDATIONS EXERCISED BY THE SCOTTISH ARMY
7492-105653-0007 BUT JAMES TOLD HIM THAT HE DOUBTED HIS CONCERN WAS EMPLOYED ONLY IN BEHALF OF AN ENEMY
7492-105653-0008 BY THE PRETENCE WHICH IT MIGHT AFFORD HIM TO LEVY IMPOSITIONS ON HIS OWN SUBJECTS HE SUMMONED A PARLIAMENT TO WHOM HE MADE BITTER COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE IRRUPTION OF THE SCOTS THE ABSURD IMPOSTURE COUNTENANCED BY THAT NATION
7492-105653-0009 THE CRUEL DEVASTATIONS COMMITTED IN THE NORTHERN COUNTIES AND THE MULTIPLIED INSULTS THUS OFFERED BOTH TO THE KING AND KINGDOM OF ENGLAND THE PARLIAMENT MADE THE EXPECTED RETURN TO THIS DISCOURSE BY GRANTING A SUBSIDY
7492-105653-0010 TO THE AMOUNT OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS
7492-105653-0011 BUT HE FOUND IT NOT SO EASY TO LEVY THE MONEY UPON HIS SUBJECTS THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ACQUAINTED WITH THE IMMENSE TREASURES WHICH HE HAD AMASSED COULD ILL BROOK THE NEW IMPOSITIONS RAISED ON EVERY SLIGHT OCCASION
7492-105653-0012 AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE FLAW WHICH WAS UNIVERSALLY KNOWN TO BE IN HIS TITLE
7492-105653-0013 WHEN THE SUBSIDY BEGAN TO BE LEVIED IN CORNWALL THE INHABITANTS NUMEROUS AND POOR ROBUST AND COURAGEOUS
7492-105653-0014 AND WHICH HAD USUALLY BEEN REPELLED BY THE FORCE OF THE NORTHERN COUNTIES THEIR ILL HUMOR WAS FURTHER INCITED BY ONE MICHAEL JOSEPH A FARRIER OF BODMIN A NOTABLE PRATING FELLOW WHO BY THRUSTING HIMSELF FORWARD ON EVERY OCCASION
7492-105653-0015 HAD ACQUIRED AN AUTHORITY AMONG THOSE RUDE PEOPLE THOMAS FLAMMOC TOO A LAWYER
7492-105653-0016 BY INFORMING THEM THAT THE TAX THOUGH IMPOSED BY PARLIAMENT WAS ENTIRELY ILLEGAL THAT THE NORTHERN NOBILITY WERE BOUND BY THEIR TENURES TO DEFEND THE NATION AGAINST THE SCOTS AND THAT IF THESE NEW IMPOSITIONS WERE TAMELY SUBMITTED TO
7492-105653-0017 THE AVARICE OF HENRY AND OF HIS MINISTERS WOULD SOON RENDER THE BURDEN INTOLERABLE TO THE NATION THE CORNISH HE SAID MUST DELIVER TO THE KING A PETITION SECONDED BY SUCH A FORCE AS WOULD GIVE IT AUTHORITY
7492-105653-0018 CARE MUST BE TAKEN BY THEIR ORDERLY DEPORTMENT TO SHOW THAT THEY HAD NOTHING IN VIEW BUT THE PUBLIC GOOD AND THE REDRESS OF ALL THOSE GRIEVANCES UNDER WHICH THE PEOPLE HAD SO LONG LABORED
7492-105653-0019 ENCOURAGED BY THESE SPEECHES THE MULTITUDE FLOCKED TOGETHER AND ARMED THEMSELVES WITH AXES BILLS BOWS AND SUCH WEAPONS AS COUNTRY PEOPLE ARE USUALLY POSSESSED OF FLAMMOC AND JOSEPH WERE CHOSEN THEIR LEADERS
7492-105653-0020 THEY SOON CONDUCTED THE CORNISH THROUGH THE COUNTY OF DEVON AND REACHED THAT OF SOMERSET AT TAUNTON THE REBELS KILLED IN THEIR FURY AN OFFICIOUS AND EAGER COMMISSIONER OF THE SUBSIDY WHOM THEY CALLED THE PROVOST OF PERIN
7492-105653-0021 A NOBLEMAN OF AN ANCIENT FAMILY POPULAR IN HIS DEPORTMENT BUT VAIN AMBITIOUS AND RESTLESS IN HIS TEMPER
7492-105653-0022 HE HAD FROM THE BEGINNING MAINTAINED A SECRET CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE FIRST MOVERS OF THE INSURRECTION AND WAS NOW JOYFULLY RECEIVED BY THEM AS THEIR LEADER PROUD OF THE COUNTENANCE GIVEN THEM BY SO CONSIDERABLE A NOBLEMAN
7492-105653-0023 THEY CONTINUED THEIR MARCH BREATHING DESTRUCTION TO THE KING'S MINISTERS AND FAVORITES PARTICULARLY TO MORTON NOW A CARDINAL AND SIR REGINALD BRAY WHO WERE DEEMED THE MOST ACTIVE INSTRUMENTS IN ALL HIS OPPRESSIONS
7492-105653-0024 NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR RAGE AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATION THEY CAREFULLY FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS GIVEN THEM BY THEIR LEADERS AND AS THEY MET WITH NO RESISTANCE THEY COMMITTED DURING THEIR MARCH NO VIOLENCE OR DISORDER
7492-105653-0025 THE REBELS HAD BEEN TOLD BY FLAMMOC THAT THE INHABITANTS OF KENT AS THEY HAD EVER DURING ALL AGES REMAINED UNSUBDUED
7492-105653-0026 AND HAD EVEN MAINTAINED THEIR INDEPENDENCE DURING THE NORMAN CONQUEST WOULD SURELY EMBRACE THEIR PARTY AND DECLARE THEMSELVES FOR A CAUSE WHICH WAS NO OTHER THAN THAT OF PUBLIC GOOD AND GENERAL LIBERTY
7492-105653-0027 BUT THE KENTISH PEOPLE HAD VERY LATELY DISTINGUISHED THEMSELVES BY REPELLING PERKIN'S INVASION AND AS THEY HAD RECEIVED FROM THE KING MANY GRACIOUS ACKNOWLEDGMENTS FOR THIS SERVICE THEIR AFFECTIONS WERE BY THAT MEANS MUCH CONCILIATED TO HIS GOVERNMENT
7492-105653-0028 IT WAS EASY THEREFORE FOR THE EARL OF KENT LORD ABERGAVENNY AND LORD COBHAM WHO POSSESSED GREAT AUTHORITY IN THOSE PARTS TO RETAIN THE PEOPLE IN OBEDIENCE AND THE CORNISH REBELS THOUGH THEY PITCHED THEIR CAMP NEAR ELTHAM AT THE VERY GATES OF LONDON
7492-105653-0029 AND INVITED ALL THE PEOPLE TO JOIN THEM GOT REENFORCEMENT FROM NO QUARTER THERE WANTED NOT DISCONTENTS EVERY WHERE BUT NO ONE WOULD TAKE PART IN SO RASH AND ILL CONCERTED AN ENTERPRISE AND BESIDES THE SITUATION IN WHICH THE KING'S AFFAIRS THEN STOOD
7492-105653-0030 HENRY IN ORDER TO OPPOSE THE SCOTS HAD ALREADY LEVIED AN ARMY WHICH HE PUT UNDER THE COMMAND OF LORD DAUBENEY THE CHAMBERLAIN AND AS SOON AS HE HEARD OF THE CORNISH INSURRECTION HE ORDERED IT TO MARCH SOUTHWARDS AND SUPPRESS THE REBELS
7492-105653-0031 NOT TO LEAVE THE NORTHERN FRONTIER DEFENCELESS
7492-105653-0032 WHO ASSEMBLED THE FORCES ON THE BORDERS AND MADE HEAD AGAINST THE ENEMY HENRY FOUND HERE THE CONCURRENCE OF THE THREE MOST FATAL INCIDENTS THAT CAN BEFALL A MONARCHY A FOREIGN ENEMY A DOMESTIC REBELLION
7492-105653-0033 AND A PRETENDER TO HIS CROWN BUT HE ENJOYED GREAT RESOURCES IN HIS ARMY AND TREASURE AND STILL MORE IN THE INTREPIDITY AND COURAGE OF HIS OWN TEMPER
7492-105653-0034 ON OTHER OCCASIONS HE HAD ALWAYS HASTENED TO A DECISION AND IT WAS A USUAL SAYING WITH HIM THAT HE DESIRED BUT TO SEE HIS REBELS BUT AS THE CORNISH MUTINEERS BEHAVED IN AN INOFFENSIVE MANNER
7492-105653-0035 AND COMMITTED NO SPOIL ON THE COUNTRY AS THEY RECEIVED NO ACCESSION OF FORCE ON THEIR MARCH OR IN THEIR ENCAMPMENT AND AS SUCH HASTY AND POPULAR TUMULTS MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO DIMINISH EVERY MOMENT BY DELAY
7492-105653-0036 HE TOOK POST IN LONDON AND ASSIDUOUSLY PREPARED THE MEANS OF INSURING VICTORY AFTER ALL HIS FORCES WERE COLLECTED HE DIVIDED THEM INTO THREE BODIES AND MARCHED OUT TO ASSAIL THE ENEMY
7492-105653-0037 THE FIRST BODY COMMANDED BY THE EARL OF OXFORD AND UNDER HIM BY THE EARLS OF ESSEX AND SUFFOLK WERE APPOINTED TO PLACE THEMSELVES BEHIND THE HILL ON WHICH THE REBELS WERE ENCAMPED THE SECOND AND MOST CONSIDERABLE HENRY PUT UNDER THE COMMAND OF LORD DAUBENEY
7492-105653-0038 AND ORDERED HIM TO ATTACK THE ENEMY IN FRONT AND BRING ON THE ACTION
7492-105653-0039 ABOUT HIS OWN PERSON AND TOOK POST IN SAINT GEORGE'S FIELDS WHERE HE SECURED THE CITY AND COULD EASILY AS OCCASION SERVED EITHER RESTORE THE FIGHT OR FINISH THE VICTORY
7492-105653-0040 DAUBENEY BEAT A DETACHMENT OF THE REBELS FROM DEPTFORD BRIDGE AND BEFORE THEIR MAIN BODY COULD BE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE HIM HE HAD GAINED THE ASCENT OF THE HILL AND PLACED HIMSELF IN ARRAY BEFORE THEM THEY WERE FORMIDABLE FROM THEIR NUMBERS
7492-105653-0041 BEING SIXTEEN THOUSAND STRONG AND WERE NOT DEFECTIVE IN VALOR BUT BEING TUMULTUARY TROOPS ILL ARMED AND NOT PROVIDED WITH CAVALRY OR ARTILLERY THEY WERE BUT AN UNEQUAL MATCH FOR THE KING'S FORCES
7492-105653-0042 DAUBENEY BEGAN THE ATTACK WITH COURAGE AND EVEN WITH A CONTEMPT OF THE ENEMY WHICH HAD ALMOST PROVED FATAL TO HIM HE RUSHED INTO THE MIDST OF THEM
7492-105653-0043 THE REBELS BEING SURROUNDED ON EVERY SIDE BY THE KING'S TROOPS WERE ALMOST ALL MADE PRISONERS AND IMMEDIATELY DISMISSED WITHOUT FURTHER PUNISHMENT
7492-105653-0044 WHETHER THAT HENRY WAS SATISFIED WITH THE VICTIMS WHO HAD FALLEN IN THE FIELD AND WHO AMOUNTED TO NEAR TWO THOUSAND OR THAT HE PITIED THE IGNORANCE AND SIMPLICITY OF THE MULTITUDE OR FAVORED THEM ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR INOFFENSIVE BEHAVIOR
7492-105653-0045 THE SCOTTISH KING WAS NOT IDLE DURING THESE COMMOTIONS IN ENGLAND HE LEVIED A CONSIDERABLE ARMY AND SAT DOWN BEFORE THE CASTLE OF NORHAM IN NORTHUMBERLAND
7492-105653-0046 JAMES REPLIED THAT HE HIMSELF WAS NO JUDGE OF THE YOUNG MAN'S PRETENSIONS BUT HAVING RECEIVED HIM AS A SUPPLICANT AND PROMISED HIM PROTECTION HE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO BETRAY A MAN WHO HAD TRUSTED TO HIS GOOD FAITH AND HIS GENEROSITY
7492-105653-0047 THE NEXT DEMAND OF THE ENGLISH MET WITH NO BETTER RECEPTION THEY REQUIRED REPARATION FOR THE RAVAGES COMMITTED BY THE LATE INROADS INTO ENGLAND THE SCOTTISH COMMISSIONERS REPLIED THAT THE SPOILS WERE LIKE WATER SPILT UPON THE GROUND
7492-105653-0048 WHICH COULD NEVER BE RECOVERED AND THAT HENRY'S SUBJECTS WERE BETTER ABLE TO BEAR THE LOSS THAN THEIR MASTER TO REPAIR IT
7492-105653-0049 HENRY'S COMMISSIONERS NEXT PROPOSED THAT THE TWO KINGS SHOULD HAVE AN INTERVIEW AT NEWCASTLE IN ORDER TO ADJUST ALL DIFFERENCES BUT JAMES SAID
7492-105653-0050 NOT TO GO A BEGGING FOR IT LEST THE CONFERENCES SHOULD BREAK OFF ALTOGETHER WITHOUT EFFECT A TRUCE WAS CONCLUDED FOR SOME MONTHS AND JAMES PERCEIVING THAT WHILE PERKIN REMAINED IN SCOTLAND
7492-105653-0051 A SOLID PEACE WITH HENRY PRIVATELY DESIRED HIM TO DEPART THE KINGDOM
7492-105653-0052 HIS USUAL RETREAT IN ALL HIS DISAPPOINTMENTS THE FLEMISH MERCHANTS WHO SEVERELY FELT THE LOSS RESULTING FROM THE INTERRUPTION OF COMMERCE WITH ENGLAND
7492-105653-0053 THE FLEMISH COURT AGREED THAT ALL ENGLISH REBELS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED THE LOW COUNTRIES AND IN THIS PROHIBITION THE DEMESNES OF THE DUCHESS DOWAGER WERE EXPRESSLY COMPREHENDED WHEN THIS PRINCIPAL ARTICLE WAS AGREED TO
7492-105653-0054 A TREATY OF COMMERCE WAS FINISHED WHICH WAS FAVORABLE TO THE FLEMINGS AND TO WHICH THEY LONG GAVE THE APPELLATION OF INTERCURSUS MAGNUS THE GREAT TREATY AND WHEN THE ENGLISH MERCHANTS RETURNED TO THEIR USUAL ABODE AT ANTWERP
7492-105653-0055 BUT AS HE MUST DISMISS ALL HIS ENGLISH RETAINERS IF HE TOOK SHELTER IN THE LOW COUNTRIES AND AS HE WAS SURE OF A COLD RECEPTION IF NOT BAD USAGE AMONG PEOPLE WHO WERE DETERMINED TO KEEP ON TERMS OF FRIENDSHIP WITH THE COURT OF ENGLAND HE THOUGHT FIT RATHER TO HIDE HIMSELF DURING SOME TIME IN THE WILDS AND FASTNESSES OF IRELAND
7492-105653-0056 IMPATIENT HOWEVER OF A RETREAT WHICH WAS BOTH DISAGREEABLE AND DANGEROUS HE HELD CONSULTATIONS WITH HIS FOLLOWERS HERNE SKELTON AND ASTLEY THREE BROKEN TRADESMEN
7492-105653-0057 BY THEIR ADVICE HE RESOLVED TO TRY THE AFFECTIONS OF THE CORNISH WHOSE MUTINOUS DISPOSITION NOTWITHSTANDING THE KING'S LENITY STILL SUBSISTED AFTER THE SUPPRESSION OF THEIR REBELLION NO SOONER DID HE APPEAR AT BODMIN IN CORNWALL
7492-105653-0058 THAN THE POPULACE TO THE NUMBER OF THREE THOUSAND FLOCKED TO HIS STANDARD AND PERKIN
7492-105653-0059 NOT TO SUFFER THE EXPECTATIONS OF HIS FOLLOWERS TO LANGUISH HE PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE EXETER AND BY MANY FAIR PROMISES INVITED THAT CITY TO JOIN HIM FINDING THAT THE INHABITANTS SHUT THEIR GATES AGAINST HIM
7492-105653-0060 HE LAID SIEGE TO THE PLACE BUT BEING UNPROVIDED WITH ARTILLERY AMMUNITION AND EVERY THING REQUISITE FOR THE ATTEMPT HE MADE NO PROGRESS IN HIS UNDERTAKING
7492-105653-0061 ALL THE COURTIERS SENSIBLE THAT THEIR ACTIVITY ON THIS OCCASION WOULD BE THE MOST ACCEPTABLE SERVICE WHICH THEY COULD RENDER THE KING DISPLAYED THEIR ZEAL FOR THE ENTERPRISE AND FORWARDED HIS PREPARATIONS
7492-105653-0062 TO THE RELIEF OF EXETER THE EARL OF DEVONSHIRE AND THE MOST CONSIDERABLE GENTLEMEN IN THE COUNTY OF THAT NAME TOOK ARMS OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AND MARCHED TO JOIN THE KING'S GENERALS
7492-105653-0063 THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM PUT HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF A TROOP CONSISTING OF YOUNG NOBILITY AND GENTRY WHO SERVED AS VOLUNTEERS
7492-105653-0064 THE KING HIMSELF PREPARED TO FOLLOW WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY AND THUS ALL ENGLAND SEEMED UNITED AGAINST A PRETENDER WHO HAD AT FIRST ENGAGED THEIR ATTENTION AND DIVIDED THEIR AFFECTIONS
7492-105653-0065 PERKIN INFORMED OF THESE GREAT PREPARATIONS IMMEDIATELY RAISED THE SIEGE OF EXETER AND RETIRED TO TAUNTON
7492-105653-0066 AND SEEMED STILL RESOLUTE TO MAINTAIN HIS CAUSE HE HIMSELF DESPAIRED OF SUCCESS AND SECRETLY WITHDREW TO THE SANCTUARY OF BEAULIEU IN THE NEW FOREST
7492-105653-0067 THE CORNISH REBELS SUBMITTED TO THE KING'S MERCY AND FOUND THAT IT WAS NOT YET EXHAUSTED IN THEIR BEHALF EXCEPT A FEW PERSONS OF DESPERATE FORTUNES WHO WERE EXECUTED AND SOME OTHERS WHO WERE SEVERELY FINED
7492-105653-0068 ALL THE REST WERE DISMISSED WITH IMPUNITY LADY CATHARINE GORDON WIFE TO PERKIN FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE VICTOR AND WAS TREATED WITH A GENEROSITY WHICH DOES HIM HONOR HE SOOTHED HER MIND WITH MANY MARKS OF REGARD
7492-105653-0069 SOME COUNSELLED HIM TO MAKE THE PRIVILEGES OF THE CHURCH YIELD TO REASONS OF STATE TO TAKE HIM BY VIOLENCE FROM THE SANCTUARY TO INFLICT ON HIM THE PUNISHMENT DUE TO HIS TEMERITY AND THUS AT ONCE TO PUT AN END TO AN IMPOSTURE
7492-105653-0070 WHICH HAD LONG DISTURBED THE GOVERNMENT AND WHICH THE CREDULITY OF THE PEOPLE AND THE ARTIFICES OF MALCONTENTS WERE STILL CAPABLE OF REVIVING
7492-105653-0071 TO DELIVER HIMSELF INTO THE KING'S HANDS
7492-105653-0072 THEY SEEMED DESIROUS OF REVENGING THEMSELVES BY THEIR INSULTS FOR THE SHAME WHICH THEIR FORMER BELIEF OF HIS IMPOSTURES HAD THROWN UPON THEM
7492-105653-0073 AND OBLIGED IN BOTH PLACES TO READ ALOUD TO THE PEOPLE THE CONFESSION WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN PUBLISHED IN HIS NAME HE WAS THEN CONFINED TO THE TOWER WHERE HIS HABITS OF RESTLESS INTRIGUE AND ENTERPRISE FOLLOWED HIM
7492-105653-0074 HE INSINUATED HIMSELF INTO THE INTIMACY OF FOUR SERVANTS OF SIR JOHN DIGBY LIEUTENANT OF THE TOWER AND BY THEIR MEANS OPENED A CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE EARL OF WARWICK WHO WAS CONFINED IN THE SAME PRISON
