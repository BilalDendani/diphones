7125-87278-0000 SHE WAS SUCH A MIXTURE OF CONTRADICTORY IMPULSES AND RAPID TRANSITIONS AND WAS SO FULL OF WHIMS AND CAPRICE THE INEVITABLE OUTGROWTH OF HER BLOOD HER RANK AND THE ADULATION AMID WHICH SHE HAD ALWAYS LIVED THAT I COULD NOT PREDICT FOR A DAY AHEAD HER ATTITUDE TOWARD ANY ONE
7125-87278-0001 SHE HAD NEVER SHOWN SO GREAT FAVOR TO ANY MAN AS TO BRANDON BUT JUST HOW MUCH OF HER CONDESCENSION WAS A MERE WHIM GROWING OUT OF THE IMPULSE OF THE MOMENT AND SUBJECT TO REACTION I COULD NOT TELL I BELIEVED HOWEVER
7125-87278-0002 THAT BRANDON STOOD UPON A FIRMER FOUNDATION WITH THIS CHANGING SHIFTING QUICKSAND OF A GIRL THAN WITH EITHER OF THEIR MAJESTIES IN FACT I THOUGHT HE RESTED UPON HER HEART ITSELF BUT TO GUESS CORRECTLY WHAT A GIRL OF THAT SORT WILL DO OR THINK
7125-87278-0003 OR FEEL WOULD REQUIRE INSPIRATION OF COURSE MOST OF THE ENTERTAINMENTS GIVEN BY THE KING AND QUEEN INCLUDED AS GUESTS NEARLY ALL THE COURT BUT MARY OFTEN HAD LITTLE FETES AND DANCING PARTIES WHICH WERE SMALLER MORE SELECT AND INFORMAL
7125-87278-0004 THESE PARTIES WERE REALLY WITH THE CONSENT AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE KING TO AVOID THE RESPONSIBILITY OF NOT INVITING EVERYBODY THE LARGER AFFAIRS WERE VERY DULL AND SMALLER ONES MIGHT GIVE OFFENSE TO THOSE WHO WERE LEFT OUT THE LATTER THEREFORE
7125-87278-0005 WERE TURNED OVER TO MARY WHO CARED VERY LITTLE WHO WAS OFFENDED OR WHO WAS NOT AND INVITATIONS TO THEM WERE HIGHLY VALUED ONE AFTERNOON A DAY OR TWO AFTER BRANDON'S PRESENTATION A MESSAGE ARRIVED FROM MARY NOTIFYING ME THAT SHE WOULD HAVE A LITTLE FETE
7125-87278-0006 THAT EVENING IN ONE OF THE SMALLER HALLS AND DIRECTING ME TO BE THERE AS MASTER OF THE DANCE ACCOMPANYING THE MESSAGE WAS A NOTE FROM NO LESS A PERSON THAN THE PRINCESS HERSELF INVITING BRANDON THIS WAS AN HONOR INDEED
7125-87278-0007 AN AUTOGRAPH INVITATION FROM THE HAND OF MARY BUT THE MASTERFUL RASCAL DID NOT SEEM TO CONSIDER IT ANYTHING UNUSUAL AND WHEN I HANDED HIM THE NOTE UPON HIS RETURN FROM THE HUNT HE SIMPLY READ IT CARELESSLY OVER ONCE TORE IT IN PIECES AND TOSSED IT AWAY
7125-87278-0008 I BELIEVE THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM WOULD HAVE GIVEN TEN THOUSAND CROWNS TO RECEIVE SUCH A NOTE AND WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE SHOWN IT TO HALF THE COURT IN TRIUMPHANT CONFIDENCE BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO THIS GREAT CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD IT WAS BUT A SCRAP OF PAPER
7125-87278-0009 HE WAS GLAD TO HAVE IT NEVERTHELESS AND WITH ALL HIS SELF RESTRAINT AND STOICISM COULD NOT CONCEAL HIS PLEASURE BRANDON AT ONCE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION IN A PERSONAL NOTE TO THE PRINCESS THE BOLDNESS OF THIS ACTUALLY TOOK MY BREATH
7125-87278-0010 AS YOU MUST KNOW BY THIS TIME HER DIGNITY ROYAL WAS SUBJECT TO ALARMS AND QUITE HER MOST TROUBLESOME ATTRIBUTE VERY APT TO RECEIVE DAMAGE IN HER RELATIONS WITH BRANDON MARY DID NOT DESTROY BRANDON'S NOTE
7125-87278-0011 DESPITE THE FACT THAT HER SENSE OF DIGNITY HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY IT BUT AFTER SHE HAD READ IT SLIPPED OFF INTO HER PRIVATE ROOM READ IT AGAIN AND PUT IT ON HER ESCRITOIRE SOON SHE PICKED IT UP REREAD IT AND AFTER A LITTLE HESITATION PUT IT IN HER POCKET
7125-87278-0012 IT REMAINED IN THE POCKET FOR A MOMENT OR TWO WHEN OUT IT CAME FOR ANOTHER PERUSAL AND THEN SHE UNFASTENED HER BODICE AND PUT IT IN HER BOSOM MARY HAD BEEN SO INTENT UPON WHAT SHE WAS DOING THAT SHE HAD NOT SEEN JANE WHO WAS SITTING QUIETLY IN THE WINDOW
7125-87278-0013 AND WHEN SHE TURNED AND SAW HER SHE WAS SO ANGRY SHE SNATCHED THE NOTE FROM HER BOSOM AND THREW IT UPON THE FLOOR STAMPING HER FOOT IN EMBARRASSMENT AND RAGE HOW DARE YOU WATCH ME HUSSY SHE CRIED YOU LURK AROUND AS STILL AS THE GRAVE
7125-87278-0014 AND I HAVE TO LOOK INTO EVERY NOOK AND CORNER WHEREVER I GO OR HAVE YOU SPYING ON ME I DID NOT SPY UPON YOU LADY MARY
7125-87278-0015 I WANT YOU TO BE LESS SILENT AFTER THIS DO YOU HEAR COUGH OR SING OR STUMBLE
7125-87278-0016 JANE ROSE PICKED UP THE NOTE AND OFFERED IT TO HER MISTRESS WHO SNATCHED IT WITH ONE HAND WHILE SHE GAVE HER A SHARP SLAP WITH THE OTHER JANE RAN OUT AND MARY FULL OF ANGER AND SHAME SLAMMED THE DOOR AND LOCKED IT
7125-87278-0017 THE NOTE BEING THE CAUSE OF ALL THE TROUBLE SHE IMPATIENTLY THREW TO THE FLOOR AGAIN AND WENT OVER TO THE WINDOW BENCH WHERE SHE THREW HERSELF DOWN TO POUT IN THE COURSE OF FIVE MINUTES SHE TURNED HER HEAD FOR ONE FLEETING INSTANT AND LOOKED AT THE NOTE AND THEN AFTER A LITTLE HESITATION
7125-87278-0018 GOING BACK TO THE LIGHT AT THE WINDOW
7125-87278-0019 AND THEN READ IT ONCE TWICE THRICE THE THIRD TIME BROUGHT THE SMILE AND THE NOTE NESTLED IN THE BOSOM AGAIN JANE DID NOT COME OFF SO WELL FOR HER MISTRESS DID NOT SPEAK TO HER UNTIL SHE CALLED HER IN THAT EVENING TO MAKE HER TOILET
7125-87278-0020 BY THAT TIME MARY HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE NOTE IN HER BOSOM SO WHEN JANE BEGAN TO ARRAY HER FOR THE DANCE IT FELL TO THE FLOOR WHEREUPON BOTH GIRLS BROKE INTO A LAUGH AND JANE KISSED MARY'S BARE SHOULDER AND MARY KISSED THE TOP OF JANE'S HEAD AND THEY WERE FRIENDS AGAIN
7125-87278-0021 SO BRANDON ACCEPTED MARY'S INVITATION AND WENT TO MARY'S DANCE BUT HIS GOING
7125-87278-0022 AND THIS WAS THE WAY OF IT THESE PARTIES OF MARY'S HAD BEEN GOING ON ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK DURING THE ENTIRE WINTER AND SPRING AND USUALLY INCLUDED THE SAME PERSONS IT WAS A SORT OF COTERIE
7125-87278-0023 STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM UNINVITED PERSONS OFTEN ATTEMPTED TO FORCE THEMSELVES IN AND ALL SORTS OF SCHEMES AND MANEUVERS WERE ADOPTED TO GAIN ADMISSION TO PREVENT THIS TWO GUARDSMEN
7125-87278-0024 MODESTY I MIGHT SAY NEITHER THRIVES NOR IS USEFUL AT COURT WHEN BRANDON PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE DOOR HIS ENTRANCE WAS BARRED BUT HE QUICKLY PUSHED ASIDE THE HALBERDS AND ENTERED THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM
7125-87278-0025 A PROUD SELF IMPORTANT INDIVIDUAL WAS STANDING NEAR THE DOOR AND SAW IT ALL NOW BUCKINGHAM WAS ONE OF THOSE UNFORTUNATE PERSONS WHO NEVER LOSE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A MISTAKE AND BEING ANXIOUS TO DISPLAY HIS ZEAL ON BEHALF OF THE PRINCESS
7125-87278-0026 STEPPED UP TO PREVENT BRANDON'S ENTRANCE SIR YOU WILL HAVE TO MOVE OUT OF THIS HE SAID POMPOUSLY YOU ARE NOT AT A JOUSTING BOUT YOU HAVE MADE A MISTAKE AND HAVE COME TO THE WRONG PLACE
7125-87278-0027 MY LORD OF BUCKINGHAM IS PLEASED TO MAKE RATHER MORE OF AN ASS OF HIMSELF THAN USUAL THIS EVENING REPLIED BRANDON WITH A SMILE AS HE STARTED ACROSS THE ROOM TO MARY WHOSE EYE HE HAD CAUGHT SHE HAD SEEN AND HEARD IT ALL BUT INSTEAD OF COMING TO HIS RELIEF
7125-87278-0028 STOOD THERE LAUGHING TO HERSELF AT THIS BUCKINGHAM GREW FURIOUS AND RAN AROUND AHEAD OF BRANDON VALIANTLY DRAWING HIS SWORD NOW BY HEAVEN FELLOW MAKE BUT ANOTHER STEP AND I WILL RUN YOU THROUGH HE SAID I SAW IT ALL
7125-87278-0029 BUT COULD HARDLY REALIZE WHAT WAS GOING ON IT CAME SO QUICKLY AND WAS OVER SO SOON LIKE A FLASH BRANDON'S SWORD WAS OUT OF ITS SHEATH AND BUCKINGHAM'S BLADE WAS FLYING TOWARD THE CEILING BRANDON'S SWORD WAS SHEATHED AGAIN SO QUICKLY THAT ONE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT HAD BEEN OUT AT ALL
7125-87278-0030 AND PICKING UP BUCKINGHAM'S HE SAID WITH A HALF SMOTHERED LAUGH MY LORD HAS DROPPED HIS SWORD HE THEN BROKE ITS POINT WITH HIS HEEL AGAINST THE HARD FLOOR SAYING I WILL DULL THE POINT LEST MY LORD BEING UNACCUSTOMED TO ITS USE WOUND HIMSELF
7125-87278-0031 THIS BROUGHT PEALS OF LAUGHTER FROM EVERYBODY INCLUDING THE KING MARY LAUGHED ALSO BUT AS BRANDON WAS HANDING BUCKINGHAM HIS BLADE CAME UP AND DEMANDED MY LORD IS THIS THE WAY YOU TAKE IT UPON YOURSELF TO RECEIVE MY GUESTS
7125-87278-0032 WHO APPOINTED YOU LET ME ASK TO GUARD MY DOOR WE SHALL HAVE TO OMIT YOUR NAME FROM OUR NEXT LIST UNLESS YOU TAKE A FEW LESSONS IN GOOD MANNERS THIS WAS STRIKING HIM HARD AND THE QUALITY OF THE MAN WILL AT ONCE APPEAR PLAIN TO YOU
7125-87278-0033 BUT CLUNG TO THE GIRL'S SKIRTS ALL THE MORE TENACIOUSLY TURNING TO BRANDON THE PRINCESS SAID MASTER BRANDON I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU AND REGRET EXCEEDINGLY THAT OUR FRIEND OF BUCKINGHAM SHOULD SO THIRST FOR YOUR BLOOD
7125-87278-0034 SHE THEN LED HIM TO THE KING AND QUEEN TO WHOM HE MADE HIS BOW
7125-87278-0035 MARY AGAIN ALLUDED TO THE SKIRMISH AT THE DOOR AND SAID LAUGHINGLY I WOULD HAVE COME TO YOUR HELP BUT I KNEW YOU WERE AMPLY ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF I WAS SURE YOU WOULD WORST THE DUKE IN SOME WAY IT WAS BETTER THAN A MUMMERY AND I WAS GLAD TO SEE IT I DO NOT LIKE HIM
7125-87278-0036 THE KING DID NOT OPEN THESE PRIVATE BALLS AS HE WAS SUPPOSED AT LEAST NOT TO BE THEIR PATRON AND THE QUEEN WHO WAS CONSIDERABLY OLDER THAN HENRY WAS AVERSE TO SUCH THINGS SO THE PRINCESS OPENED HER OWN BALLS
7125-87278-0037 DANCING FOR A FEW MINUTES WITH THE FLOOR ENTIRELY TO HERSELF AND PARTNER IT WAS THE HONOR OF THE EVENING TO OPEN THE BALL WITH HER AND QUITE CURIOUS TO SEE HOW MEN PUT THEMSELVES IN HER WAY AND STOOD SO AS TO BE EASILY OBSERVED AND PERCHANCE CHOSEN
7125-87278-0038 BRANDON AFTER LEAVING MARY HAD DRIFTED INTO A CORNER OF THE ROOM BACK OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE AND WAS TALKING TO WOLSEY WHO WAS ALWAYS VERY FRIENDLY TO HIM AND TO MASTER CAVENDISH A QUAINT QUIET EASY LITTLE MAN FULL OF LEARNING AND KINDNESS
7125-87278-0039 AND A WARM FRIEND TO THE PRINCESS MARY IT WAS TIME TO OPEN THE BALL AND FROM MY PLACE IN THE MUSICIANS GALLERY I COULD SEE MARY MOVING ABOUT AMONG THE GUESTS EVIDENTLY LOOKING FOR A PARTNER
7125-87278-0040 WHILE THE MEN RESORTED TO SOME VERY TRANSPARENT AND AMUSING EXPEDIENTS TO ATTRACT HER ATTENTION THE PRINCESS HOWEVER TOOK NONE OF THE BIDDERS AND SOON I NOTICED
7125-87278-0041 SOMETHING TOLD ME SHE WAS GOING TO ASK HIM TO OPEN THE DANCE AND I REGRETTED IT BECAUSE I KNEW IT WOULD SET EVERY NOBLEMAN IN THE HOUSE AGAINST HIM THEY BEING VERY JEALOUS OF THE LOW BORN FAVORITES AS THEY CALLED THE UNTITLED FRIENDS OF ROYALTY
7125-87278-0042 SURE ENOUGH I WAS RIGHT MARY AT ONCE BEGAN TO MAKE HER WAY OVER TO THE CORNER AND I HEARD HER SAY MASTER BRANDON WILL YOU DANCE WITH ME IT WAS DONE PRETTILY
7125-87278-0043 IN PLACE OF THE OLD TIME CONFIDENCE STRONGLY TINGED WITH ARROGANCE SHE WAS ALMOST SHY AND BLUSHED AND STAMMERED WITH QUICK COMING BREATH LIKE A BURGHER MAID BEFORE HER NEW FOUND GALLANT AT ONCE THE COURTIERS MADE WAY FOR HER AND OUT SHE WALKED
7125-87278-0044 LEADING BRANDON BY THE HAND UPON HER LIPS AND IN HER EYES WAS A RARE TRIUMPHANT SMILE AS IF TO SAY LOOK AT THIS HANDSOME NEW TROPHY OF MY BOW AND SPEAR I WAS SURPRISED AND ALARMED WHEN MARY CHOSE BRANDON
7125-87278-0045 BUT WHEN I TURNED TO THE MUSICIANS TO DIRECT THEIR PLAY IMAGINE IF YOU CAN MY SURPRISE WHEN THE LEADER SAID MASTER WE HAVE OUR ORDERS FOR THE FIRST DANCE FROM THE PRINCESS IMAGINE ALSO IF YOU CAN
7125-87278-0046 MY DOUBLE SURPRISE AND ALARM NAY ALMOST MY TERROR WHEN THE BAND STRUCK UP JANE'S SAILOR LASS I SAW THE LOOK OF SURPRISE AND INQUIRY WHICH BRANDON GAVE MARY STANDING THERE DEMURELY BY HIS SIDE WHEN HE FIRST HEARD THE MUSIC
7125-87278-0047 AND I HEARD HER NERVOUS LITTLE LAUGH AS SHE NODDED HER HEAD YES AND STEPPED CLOSER TO HIM TO TAKE POSITION FOR THE DANCE THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS IN BRANDON'S ARMS FLYING LIKE A SYLPH ABOUT THE ROOM A BUZZ OF ASTONISHMENT AND DELIGHT
7125-87278-0048 GREETED THEM BEFORE THEY WERE HALF WAY AROUND AND THEN A GREAT CLAPPING OF HANDS IN WHICH THE KING HIMSELF JOINED IT WAS A LOVELY SIGHT ALTHOUGH I THINK A GRACEFUL WOMAN IS MORE BEAUTIFUL IN LA GALLIARD THAN ANY OTHER DANCE
7125-87278-0049 OR IN FACT ANY OTHER SITUATION IN WHICH SHE CAN PLACE HERSELF AFTER A LITTLE TIME THE DOWAGER DUCHESS OF KENT FIRST LADY IN WAITING TO THE QUEEN PRESENTED HERSELF AT THE MUSICIANS GALLERY AND SAID THAT HER MAJESTY
7125-87278-0050 HAD ORDERED THE MUSIC STOPPED AND THE MUSICIANS OF COURSE CEASED PLAYING AT ONCE MARY THEREUPON TURNED QUICKLY TO ME MASTER ARE OUR MUSICIANS WEARY THAT THEY STOP BEFORE WE ARE THROUGH THE QUEEN ANSWERED FOR ME IN A HIGH VOICED SPANISH ACCENT
7125-87278-0051 I ORDERED THE MUSIC STOPPED I WILL NOT PERMIT SUCH AN INDECENT EXHIBITION TO GO ON LONGER FIRE SPRANG TO MARY'S EYES AND SHE EXCLAIMED IF YOUR MAJESTY DOES NOT LIKE THE WAY WE DO AND DANCE AT MY BALLS YOU CAN RETIRE AS SOON AS YOU SEE FIT
7125-87278-0052 YOUR FACE IS A KILL MIRTH ANYWAY IT NEVER TOOK LONG TO ROUSE HER LADYSHIP THE QUEEN TURNED TO HENRY WHO WAS LAUGHING AND ANGRILY DEMANDED WILL YOUR MAJESTY PERMIT ME TO BE THUS INSULTED IN YOUR VERY PRESENCE
7125-87278-0053 YOU GOT YOURSELF INTO IT GET OUT OF IT AS BEST YOU CAN I HAVE OFTEN TOLD YOU TO LET HER ALONE SHE HAS SHARP CLAWS THE KING WAS REALLY TIRED OF CATHERINE'S SOUR FROWN BEFORE HE MARRIED HER IT WAS HER DOWER OF SPANISH GOLD
7125-87278-0054 THAT BROUGHT HER A SECOND TUDOR HUSBAND SHALL I NOT HAVE WHAT MUSIC AND DANCES I WANT AT MY OWN BALLS ASKED THE PRINCESS THAT YOU SHALL SISTER MINE THAT YOU SHALL
7125-87278-0055 GO ON MASTER AND IF THE GIRL LIKES TO DANCE THAT WAY IN GOD'S NAME LET HER HAVE HER WISH IT WILL NEVER HURT HER WE WILL LEARN IT OURSELF AND WILL WEAR THE LADIES OUT A DANCING AFTER MARY HAD FINISHED THE OPENING DANCE
7125-87278-0056 THERE WAS A GREAT DEMAND FOR INSTRUCTION THE KING ASKED BRANDON TO TEACH HIM THE STEPS WHICH HE SOON LEARNED TO PERFORM WITH A GRACE PERHAPS EQUALED BY NO LIVING CREATURE OTHER THAN A FAT BROWN BEAR THE LADIES WERE AT FIRST A LITTLE SHY
7125-87278-0057 AND INCLINED TO STAND AT ARM'S LENGTH BUT MARY HAD SET THE FASHION AND THE OTHERS SOON FOLLOWED I HAD TAKEN A FIDDLER TO MY ROOM AND HAD LEARNED THE DANCE FROM BRANDON AND WAS ABLE TO TEACH IT ALSO THOUGH I LACKED PRACTICE TO MAKE MY STEP PERFECT
7125-87278-0058 THE PRINCESS HAD NEEDED NO PRACTICE BUT HAD DANCED BEAUTIFULLY FROM THE FIRST HER STRONG YOUNG LIMBS AND SUPPLE BODY TAKING AS NATURALLY TO ANYTHING REQUIRING GRACE OF MOVEMENT AS A CYGNET TO WATER THIS THOUGHT I
7125-87278-0059 IS MY OPPORTUNITY TO TEACH JANE THE NEW DANCE I WANTED TO GO TO HER FIRST BUT WAS AFRAID OR FOR SOME REASON DID NOT AND TOOK SEVERAL OTHER LADIES AS THEY CAME AFTER I HAD SHOWN THE STEP TO THEM I SOUGHT OUT MY SWEETHEART
7125-87278-0060 JANE WAS NOT A PRUDE BUT I HONESTLY BELIEVE SHE WAS THE MOST PROVOKING GIRL THAT EVER LIVED I NEVER HAD SUCCEEDED IN HOLDING HER HAND EVEN THE SMALLEST PART OF AN INSTANT AND YET I WAS SURE SHE LIKED ME VERY MUCH ALMOST SURE SHE LOVED ME
7125-87278-0061 SHE FEARED I MIGHT UNHINGE IT AND CARRY IT AWAY OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT I SUPPOSE WHEN I WENT UP AND ASKED HER TO LET ME TEACH HER THE NEW DANCE SHE SAID I THANK YOU EDWIN BUT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO ARE MORE ANXIOUS TO LEARN THAN I
7125-87278-0062 AND YOU HAD BETTER TEACH THEM FIRST BUT I WANT TO TEACH YOU WHEN I WISH TO TEACH THEM I WILL GO TO THEM YOU DID GO TO SEVERAL OTHERS BEFORE YOU THOUGHT OF COMING TO ME ANSWERED JANE PRETENDING TO BE PIQUED
7125-87278-0063 NOW THAT WAS THE UNKINDEST THING I EVER KNEW A GIRL TO DO REFUSE ME WHAT SHE KNEW I SO WANTED AND THEN PUT THE REFUSAL ON THE PRETENDED GROUND THAT I DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT IT I SO TOLD HER AND SHE SAW SHE HAD CARRIED THINGS TOO FAR
7125-87278-0064 AND THAT I WAS GROWING ANGRY IN EARNEST SHE THEN MADE ANOTHER FALSE THOUGH SOMEWHAT FLATTERING EXCUSE I COULD NOT BEAR TO GO THROUGH THAT DANCE BEFORE SO LARGE A COMPANY I SHOULD NOT OBJECT SO MUCH IF NO ONE ELSE COULD SEE
7125-87278-0065 THAT IS WITH YOU EDWIN EDWIN OH SO SOFT AND SWEET THE LITTLE JADE TO THINK THAT SHE COULD HOODWINK ME SO EASILY AND TALK ME INTO A GOOD HUMOR WITH HER SOFT PURRING EDWIN I SAW THROUGH IT ALL QUICKLY ENOUGH
7125-87278-0066 AND LEFT HER WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD IN A FEW MINUTES SHE WENT INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM WHERE I KNEW SHE WAS ALONE THE DOOR WAS OPEN AND THE MUSIC COULD BE HEARD THERE SO I FOLLOWED MY LADY THERE IS NO ONE TO SEE US HERE
7125-87278-0067 I CAN TEACH YOU NOW IF YOU WISH SAID I SHE SAW SHE WAS CORNERED AND REPLIED WITH A TOSS OF HER SAUCY LITTLE HEAD BUT WHAT IF I DO NOT WISH NOW THIS WAS MORE THAN I COULD ENDURE WITH PATIENCE SO I ANSWERED MY YOUNG LADY
7125-87278-0068 YOU SHALL ASK ME BEFORE I TEACH YOU THERE ARE OTHERS WHO CAN DANCE IT MUCH BETTER THAN YOU SHE RETURNED WITHOUT LOOKING AT ME IF YOU ALLOW ANOTHER TO TEACH YOU THAT DANCE I RESPONDED YOU WILL HAVE SEEN THE LAST OF ME
7125-87278-0069 SHE HAD MADE ME ANGRY AND I DID NOT SPEAK TO HER FOR MORE THAN A WEEK WHEN I DID BUT I WILL TELL YOU OF THAT LATER ON THERE WAS ONE THING ABOUT JANE AND THE NEW STEP
7125-87278-0070 AND FOOLISH AS MY FEELING MAY HAVE BEEN I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF HER DOING IT I RESOLVED THAT IF SHE PERMITTED ANOTHER MAN TO TEACH HER THAT DANCE IT SHOULD BE ALL OVER BETWEEN US
7125-87278-0071 THAT OF LOSING JANE AND IT CAME LIKE A VERY STROKE UPON MY HEART I WOULD THINK OF HER SWEET LITTLE FORM SO COMPACT AND GRACEFUL OF HER GRAY CALM EYES SO FULL OF PURITY AND MISCHIEF OF HER FAIR OVAL FACE ALMOST PALE
7125-87278-0072 AND WONDER IF I COULD LIVE WITHOUT THE HOPE OF HER I DETERMINED HOWEVER THAT IF SHE LEARNED THE NEW DANCE WITH ANY OTHER MAN I WOULD THROW THAT HOPE TO THE WINDS WHETHER I LIVED OR DIED SAINT GEORGE I BELIEVE I SHOULD HAVE DIED
7125-87278-0073 THE EVENING WAS DEVOTED TO LEARNING THE NEW DANCE AND I SAW MARY BUSILY ENGAGED IMPARTING INFORMATION AMONG THE LADIES AS WE WERE ABOUT TO DISPERSE I HEARD HER SAY TO BRANDON YOU HAVE GREATLY PLEASED THE KING
7125-87278-0074 BY BRINGING HIM A NEW AMUSEMENT HE ASKED ME WHERE I LEARNED IT AND I TOLD HIM YOU HAD TAUGHT IT TO CASKODEN AND THAT I HAD IT FROM HIM I TOLD CASKODEN SO THAT HE CAN TELL THE SAME STORY OH BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
7125-87278-0075 DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD HIM THE TRUTH OR HAVE EVADED IT IN SOME WAY ASKED BRANDON WHO WAS REALLY A GREAT LOVER OF THE TRUTH WHEN POSSIBLE BUT WHO I FEAR ON THIS OCCASION WISHED TO APPEAR MORE TRUTHFUL THAN HE REALLY WAS
7125-87278-0076 IF A MAN IS TO A WOMAN'S TASTE AND SHE IS INCLINED TO HIM HE LAYS UP GREAT STORES IN HER HEART BY MAKING HER THINK HIM GOOD AND SHAMEFUL IMPOSITIONS ARE OFTEN PRACTICED TO THIS END MARY FLUSHED A LITTLE AND ANSWERED I CAN'T HELP IT
7125-87278-0077 YOU DO NOT KNOW HAD I TOLD HENRY THAT WE FOUR HAD ENJOYED SUCH A FAMOUS TIME IN MY ROOMS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY ANGRY AND AND YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE SUFFERER BUT MIGHT YOU NOT HAVE COMPROMISED MATTERS BY GOING AROUND THE TRUTH SOME WAY
7125-87278-0078 AND LEAVING THE IMPRESSION THAT OTHERS WERE OF THE PARTY THAT EVENING THAT WAS A MISTAKE FOR IT GAVE MARY AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETALIATE THE BEST WAY TO GO AROUND THE TRUTH AS YOU CALL IT IS BY A DIRECT LIE MY LIE WAS NO WORSE THAN YOURS
7125-87278-0079 BUT I DID NOT STOP TO ARGUE ABOUT SUCH MATTERS THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE I WISHED TO SAY I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE GREATLY PLEASED THE KING WITH THE NEW DANCE NOW TEACH HIM HONOR AND RUFF AND YOUR FORTUNE IS MADE HE HAS HAD SOME JEWS AND LOMBARDS
7125-87278-0080 IN OF LATE TO TEACH HIM NEW GAMES AT CARDS BUT YOURS IS WORTH ALL OF THEM THEN SOMEWHAT HASTILY AND IRRELEVANTLY I DID NOT DANCE THE NEW DANCE WITH ANY OTHER GENTLEMAN BUT I SUPPOSE YOU DID NOT NOTICE IT
