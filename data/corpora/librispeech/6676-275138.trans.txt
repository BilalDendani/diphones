6676-275138-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY THREE MISSUS ROMSEY THE ONE HOTEL IN SANDYSEAL WAS FULL FROM THE TOPMOST STORY TO THE GROUND FLOOR
6676-275138-0001 AND BY FAR THE LARGER HALF OF THE LANDLORD'S GUESTS WERE INVALIDS SENT TO HIM BY THE DOCTORS TO PERSONS OF EXCITABLE TEMPERAMENT IN SEARCH OF AMUSEMENT THE PLACE OFFERED NO ATTRACTIONS
6676-275138-0002 SITUATED AT THE INNERMOST END OF A DULL LITTLE BAY SANDYSEAL SO FAR AS ANY VIEW OF THE SHIPPING IN THE CHANNEL WAS CONCERNED MIGHT HAVE BEEN BUILT ON A REMOTE ISLAND IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN
6676-275138-0003 VESSELS OF ANY IMPORTANCE KEPT WELL OUT OF THE WAY OF TREACHEROUS SHOALS AND CURRENTS LURKING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE BAY THE ANCHORAGE GROUND WAS GOOD
6676-275138-0004 BUT THE DEPTH OF WATER WAS SUITED TO SMALL VESSELS ONLY TO SHABBY OLD FISHING SMACKS WHICH SELDOM PAID THEIR EXPENSES AND TO DIRTY LITTLE COASTERS CARRYING COALS AND POTATOES
6676-275138-0005 AT THE BACK OF THE HOTEL TWO SLOVENLY ROWS OF COTTAGES TOOK THEIR CROOKED COURSE INLAND SAILING MASTERS OF YACHTS OFF DUTY SAT AND YAWNED AT THE WINDOWS LAZY FISHERMEN
6676-275138-0006 LOOKED WEARILY AT THE WEATHER OVER THEIR GARDEN GATES AND SUPERFLUOUS COASTGUARDS GATHERED TOGETHER IN A WOODEN OBSERVATORY AND LEVELED USELESS TELESCOPES AT AN EMPTY SEA THE FLAT OPEN COUNTRY
6676-275138-0007 WITH ITS FEW DWARF TREES AND ITS MANGY HEDGES LAY PROSTRATE UNDER THE SKY IN ALL THE DESOLATION OF SOLITARY SPACE AND LEFT THE FAMOUS RESTORATIVE AIR FREE TO BUILD UP DILAPIDATED NERVES
6676-275138-0008 WITHOUT AN OBJECT TO HINDER ITS PASSAGE AT ANY POINT OF THE COMPASS THE LONELY DRAB COLORED ROAD THAT LED TO THE NEAREST TOWN OFFERED TO VISITORS TAKING AIRINGS
6676-275138-0009 A VIEW OF A LOW BROWN OBJECT IN THE DISTANCE SAID TO BE THE CONVENT IN WHICH THE NUNS LIVED SECLUDED FROM MORTAL EYES AT ONE SIDE OF THE HOTEL THE WINDOWS LOOKED ON A LITTLE WOODEN PIER SADLY IN WANT OF REPAIR
6676-275138-0010 ON THE OTHER SIDE A WALLED INCLOSURE ACCOMMODATED YACHTS OF LIGHT TONNAGE STRIPPED OF THEIR RIGGING AND SITTING SOLITARY ON A BANK OF MUD UNTIL THEIR OWNERS WANTED THEM IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
6676-275138-0011 THERE WAS A SMALL OUTLYING COLONY OF SHOPS ONE THAT SOLD FRUIT AND FISH ONE THAT DEALT IN GROCERIES AND TOBACCO ONE SHUT UP WITH A BILL IN THE WINDOW INVITING A TENANT AND ONE BEHIND THE METHODIST CHAPEL
6676-275138-0012 AND A STOREHOUSE FOR ROPES AND COALS BEYOND THESE OBJECTS THERE WAS NOTHING AND THIS WAS THE GREAT CHARM OF THE PLACE TO DISTRACT THE ATTENTION OF INVALIDS FOLLOWING THE DOCTOR'S DIRECTIONS AND FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
6676-275138-0013 TAKING CARE OF THEIR HEALTH THE TIME WAS EVENING THE SCENE WAS ONE OF THE PRIVATE SITTING ROOMS IN THE HOTEL AND THE PURPOSE IN VIEW WAS A LITTLE TEA PARTY
6676-275138-0014 RICH MISSUS ROMSEY CONNECTED WITH COMMERCE AS WIFE OF THE CHIEF PARTNER IN THE FIRM OF ROMSEY AND RENSHAW WAS STAYING AT THE HOTEL IN THE INTERESTS OF HER THREE CHILDREN THEY WERE OF DELICATE CONSTITUTION
6676-275138-0015 THEIR COMPLETE RECOVERY AFTER SEVERE ILLNESS WHICH HAD PASSED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER WAS LESS SPEEDY THAN HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED AND THE DOCTOR HAD DECLARED THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WAS IN EACH CASE MORE OR LESS IN NEED OF REPAIR
6676-275138-0016 TO ARRIVE AT THIS CONCLUSION AND TO RECOMMEND A VISIT TO SANDYSEAL WERE EVENTS WHICH FOLLOWED EACH OTHER MEDICALLY SPEAKING AS A MATTER OF COURSE THE HEALTH OF THE CHILDREN
6676-275138-0017 HAD GREATLY IMPROVED THE FAMOUS AIR HAD AGREED WITH THEM AND THE DISCOVERY OF NEW PLAYFELLOWS HAD AGREED WITH THEM THEY HAD MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH LADY MYRIE'S WELL BRED BOYS AND WITH MISSUS NORMAN'S CHARMING LITTLE KITTY
6676-275138-0018 THE MOST CORDIAL GOOD FEELING HAD ESTABLISHED ITSELF AMONG THE MOTHERS OWING A RETURN FOR HOSPITALITIES RECEIVED FROM LADY MYRIE AND MISSUS NORMAN MISSUS ROMSEY HAD INVITED THE TWO LADIES TO DRINK TEA WITH HER
6676-275138-0019 IN HONOR OF AN INTERESTING DOMESTIC EVENT HER HUSBAND ABSENT ON THE CONTINENT FOR SOME TIME PAST ON BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH HIS FIRM HAD RETURNED TO ENGLAND AND HAD THAT EVENING
6676-275138-0020 LADY MYRIE HAD ARRIVED AND MISTER ROMSEY HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO HER MISSUS NORMAN EXPECTED TO FOLLOW WAS REPRESENTED BY A COURTEOUS NOTE OF APOLOGY
6676-275138-0021 SHE WAS NOT WELL THAT EVENING AND SHE BEGGED TO BE EXCUSED THIS IS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT MISSUS ROMSEY SAID TO HER HUSBAND YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN CHARMED WITH MISSUS NORMAN HIGHLY BRED

6676-275138-0023 MISTER ROMSEY LOOKED INTERESTED FOR A MOMENT WHEN HE FIRST HEARD MISSUS NORMAN'S NAME AFTER THAT HE SLOWLY STIRRED HIS TEA AND SEEMED TO BE THINKING INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO HIS WIFE
6676-275138-0024 HAVE YOU MADE THE LADY'S ACQUAINTANCE HERE HE INQUIRED YES AND I HOPE I HAVE MADE A FRIEND FOR LIFE MISSUS ROMSEY SAID WITH ENTHUSIASM AND SO DO I LADY MYRIE ADDED
6676-275138-0025 MISTER ROMSEY WENT ON WITH HIS INQUIRIES IS SHE A HANDSOME WOMAN BOTH THE LADIES ANSWERED THE QUESTION TOGETHER LADY MYRIE DESCRIBED MISSUS NORMAN
6676-275138-0026 IN ONE DREADFUL WORD AS CLASSICAL BY COMPARISON WITH THIS MISSUS ROMSEY'S REPLY WAS INTELLIGIBLE NOT EVEN ILLNESS CAN SPOIL HER BEAUTY INCLUDING THE HEADACHE SHE HAS GOT TO NIGHT

6676-275138-0028 CONNECTED WITH HER HUSBAND HE ASKED LADY MYRIE ENTERED A PROTEST SHE WAS A WIDOW AND IT WAS NOTORIOUS AMONG HER FRIENDS THAT THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND
6676-275138-0029 HAD BEEN THE HAPPIEST EVENT IN HER MARRIED LIFE BUT SHE UNDERSTOOD HER DUTY TO HERSELF AS A RESPECTABLE WOMAN I THINK MISTER ROMSEY YOU MIGHT HAVE SPARED THAT CRUEL ALLUSION
6676-275138-0030 SHE SAID WITH DIGNITY MISTER ROMSEY APOLOGIZED HE HAD HIS REASONS FOR WISHING TO KNOW SOMETHING MORE ABOUT MISSUS NORMAN HE PROPOSED TO WITHDRAW HIS LAST REMARK
6676-275138-0031 AND TO PUT HIS INQUIRIES UNDER ANOTHER FORM MIGHT HE ASK HIS WIFE IF ANYBODY HAD SEEN MISTER NORMAN NO OR HEARD OF HIM MISSUS ROMSEY ANSWERED IN THE NEGATIVE ONCE MORE
6676-275138-0032 AND ADDED A QUESTION ON HER OWN ACCOUNT WHAT DID ALL THIS MEAN IT MEANS LADY MYRIE INTERPOSED WHAT WE POOR WOMEN ARE ALL EXPOSED TO SCANDAL
6676-275138-0033 SHE HAD NOT YET FORGIVEN MISTER ROMSEY'S ALLUSION AND SHE LOOKED AT HIM POINTEDLY AS SHE SPOKE THERE ARE SOME IMPENETRABLE MEN ON WHOM LOOKS PRODUCE NO IMPRESSION
6676-275138-0034 MISTER ROMSEY WAS ONE OF THEM HE TURNED TO HIS WIFE AND SAID QUIETLY WHAT I MEAN IS THAT I KNOW MORE OF MISSUS NORMAN THAN YOU DO I HAVE HEARD OF HER
6676-275138-0035 NEVER MIND HOW OR WHERE SHE IS A LADY WHO HAS BEEN CELEBRATED IN THE NEWSPAPERS DON'T BE ALARMED SHE IS NO LESS A PERSON THAN THE DIVORCED MISSUS LINLEY
