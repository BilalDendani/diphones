7150-111618-0004 ONE DOES NOT ARGUE FOR THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS NOT ARGUABLE ONE SHRUGS AFTER ALL WHAT HUMAN GESTURE MORE ELOQUENT OR MORE SATISFYING TO THE PERFORMER THAN THE SHRUG

7150-111618-0022 WHERE COULD ANOTHER WOMAN HAVE BEEN FOUND SO MARVELLOUSLY GIFTED TO BE THE WIFE OF A ROMANCER IT SEEMS ODD THAT PHILADELPHIA AND EDINBURGH
7150-111618-0023 THE TWO MOST CONSERVATIVELY MINDED CITIES OF THE ANGLO SAXON EARTH SHOULD HAVE COMBINED TO PRODUCE THIS THE MOST RADIANT PAIR OF ADVENTURERS IN OUR RECENT ANNALS

7150-111618-0026 FOR AT THE CRYSTAL HEADWATER OF THAT SAME CREEK WAS PENNED THE AMENITIES OF BOOK COLLECTING
7150-111618-0027 THAT ENCHANTING VOLUME OF BOOKISH ESSAYS WHICH HAS SWELLED THE CORRESPONDENCE OF A PHILADELPHIA BUSINESS MAN TO INSANE PROPORTIONS AND EVEN BROUGHT HIM OFFERS FROM THREE NEWSPAPERS TO CONDUCT A BOOK PAGE
7150-111618-0028 IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE TO THE PRESENT CHRONICLER THAT IN A QUIET LIBRARY OVERLOOKING THE CLEAR FOUNT AND ORIGIN OF DEAR DARBY CREEK THERE ARE SEVERAL OF THE MOST CHERISHED ASSOCIATION VOLUMES OF R L S
7150-111618-0029 AND THE MANUSCRIPT OF LITTLE SMOUTIE'S VERY FIRST BOOK THE HISTORY OF MOSES WAS THERE EVER A MORE JOYOUS COVENANT OF AFFECTION THAN THAT OF MIFFLIN MC GILL AND OURSELF

7150-111618-0032 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH AN EQUALLY FREAKISH INSANE AND INNOCENT IDIOT SUCH AS OUR GENEROUSLY MAD FRIEND MIFFLIN ADMIRABLE ADVENTURES ARE SURE TO FOLLOW
7150-111618-0033 NEVER IN ANY YOUNG LIVES PAST OR TO COME COULD THERE BE AN INSTANT OF PURER EXCITEMENT AND GLORY THAN WHEN AFTER BICYCLING HOTLY ALL DAY WITH THE BLUE OUTLINE OF ARTHUR'S SEAT
7150-111618-0034 APPARENTLY ALWAYS RECEDING BEFORE US WE TRUNDLED GRIMLY INTO AULD REEKIE AND SET OUT FOR THE OLD STEVENSON HOME AT SEVENTEEN HERIOT ROW HALTING ONLY TO BESTOW OUR PNEUMATIC STEEDS IN THE NEAREST AND HUMBLEST AVAILABLE HOSTELRY

7150-111618-0039 FABLED TO RETAIN SOME PITHY RECOLLECTION ALAS THE SUFFOLK ANCIENT EAGER ENOUGH TO SHARE TOBACCO AND SPEECH WOULD ONLY MULL OVER HIS MEMORIES OF A PREVIOUS RECTOR
