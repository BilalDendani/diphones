8169-118202-0000 THE ELDER WAS MARRIED TO A TRADESMAN IN TOWN THE YOUNGER TO A PEASANT IN THE VILLAGE AS THE SISTERS SAT OVER THEIR TEA TALKING THE ELDER BEGAN TO BOAST OF THE ADVANTAGES OF TOWN LIFE SAYING HOW COMFORTABLY THEY LIVED THERE HOW WELL THEY DRESSED
8169-118202-0001 WHAT FINE CLOTHES HER CHILDREN WORE WHAT GOOD THINGS THEY ATE AND DRANK AND HOW SHE WENT TO THE THEATRE PROMENADES AND ENTERTAINMENTS THE YOUNGER SISTER WAS PIQUED AND IN TURN DISPARAGED THE LIFE OF A TRADESMAN AND STOOD UP FOR THAT OF A PEASANT
8169-118202-0002 I WOULD NOT CHANGE MY WAY OF LIFE FOR YOURS SAID SHE WE MAY LIVE ROUGHLY BUT AT LEAST WE ARE FREE FROM ANXIETY YOU LIVE IN BETTER STYLE THAN WE DO BUT THOUGH YOU OFTEN EARN MORE THAN YOU NEED
8169-118202-0003 YOU KNOW THE PROVERB LOSS AND GAIN ARE BROTHERS TWAIN IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE WEALTHY ONE DAY ARE BEGGING THEIR BREAD THE NEXT OUR WAY IS SAFER THOUGH A PEASANT'S LIFE IS NOT A FAT ONE
8169-118202-0004 IT IS A LONG ONE WE SHALL NEVER GROW RICH BUT WE SHALL ALWAYS HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT THE ELDER SISTER SAID SNEERINGLY ENOUGH
8169-118202-0005 WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF ELEGANCE OR MANNERS HOWEVER MUCH YOUR GOOD MAN MAY SLAVE YOU WILL DIE AS YOU ARE LIVING ON A DUNG HEAP AND YOUR CHILDREN THE SAME
8169-118202-0006 WELL WHAT OF THAT REPLIED THE YOUNGER OF COURSE OUR WORK IS ROUGH AND COARSE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS SURE AND WE NEED NOT BOW TO ANY ONE BUT YOU IN YOUR TOWNS ARE SURROUNDED BY TEMPTATIONS
8169-118202-0007 TODAY ALL MAY BE RIGHT BUT TOMORROW THE EVIL ONE MAY TEMPT YOUR HUSBAND WITH CARDS WINE OR WOMEN AND ALL WILL GO TO RUIN DON'T SUCH THINGS HAPPEN OFTEN ENOUGH PAHOM
8169-118202-0008 THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WAS LYING ON THE TOP OF THE OVEN AND HE LISTENED TO THE WOMEN'S CHATTER IT IS PERFECTLY TRUE THOUGHT HE
8169-118202-0009 OUR ONLY TROUBLE IS THAT WE HAVEN'T LAND ENOUGH
8169-118202-0010 THE WOMEN FINISHED THEIR TEA CHATTED A WHILE ABOUT DRESS AND THEN CLEARED AWAY THE TEA THINGS AND LAY DOWN TO SLEEP BUT THE DEVIL HAD BEEN SITTING BEHIND THE OVEN AND HAD HEARD ALL THAT WAS SAID
8169-118202-0011 ALL RIGHT THOUGHT THE DEVIL WE WILL HAVE A TUSSLE
8169-118202-0012 WHO HAD AN ESTATE OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED ACRES SHE HAD ALWAYS LIVED ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE PEASANTS UNTIL SHE ENGAGED AS HER STEWARD AN OLD SOLDIER WHO TOOK TO BURDENING THE PEOPLE WITH FINES
8169-118202-0013 HOWEVER CAREFUL PAHOM TRIED TO BE IT HAPPENED AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT NOW A HORSE OF HIS GOT AMONG THE LADY'S OATS NOW A COW STRAYED INTO HER GARDEN NOW HIS CALVES FOUND THEIR WAY INTO HER MEADOWS
8169-118202-0014 AND HE ALWAYS HAD TO PAY A FINE PAHOM PAID BUT GRUMBLED AND GOING HOME IN A TEMPER WAS ROUGH WITH HIS FAMILY ALL THROUGH THAT SUMMER PAHOM HAD MUCH TROUBLE BECAUSE OF THIS STEWARD
8169-118202-0015 AND HE WAS EVEN GLAD WHEN WINTER CAME AND THE CATTLE HAD TO BE STABLED THOUGH HE GRUDGED THE FODDER WHEN THEY COULD NO LONGER GRAZE ON THE PASTURE LAND AT LEAST HE WAS FREE FROM ANXIETY ABOUT THEM
8169-118202-0016 IN THE WINTER THE NEWS GOT ABOUT THAT THE LADY WAS GOING TO SELL HER LAND AND THAT THE KEEPER OF THE INN ON THE HIGH ROAD WAS BARGAINING FOR IT WHEN THE PEASANTS HEARD THIS THEY WERE VERY MUCH ALARMED WELL THOUGHT THEY
8169-118202-0017 IF THE INNKEEPER GETS THE LAND HE WILL WORRY US WITH FINES WORSE THAN THE LADY'S STEWARD WE ALL DEPEND ON THAT ESTATE SO THE PEASANTS WENT ON BEHALF OF THEIR COMMUNE
8169-118202-0018 AND ASKED THE LADY NOT TO SELL THE LAND TO THE INNKEEPER OFFERING HER A BETTER PRICE FOR IT THEMSELVES THE LADY AGREED TO LET THEM HAVE IT THEN THE PEASANTS TRIED TO ARRANGE FOR THE COMMUNE TO BUY THE WHOLE ESTATE SO THAT IT MIGHT BE HELD BY ALL IN COMMON
8169-118202-0019 THEY MET TWICE TO DISCUSS IT BUT COULD NOT SETTLE THE MATTER THE EVIL ONE SOWED DISCORD AMONG THEM AND THEY COULD NOT AGREE SO THEY DECIDED TO BUY THE LAND INDIVIDUALLY EACH ACCORDING TO HIS MEANS AND THE LADY AGREED TO THIS PLAN
8169-118202-0020 AS SHE HAD TO THE OTHER PRESENTLY PAHOM HEARD THAT A NEIGHBOR OF HIS WAS BUYING FIFTY ACRES AND THAT THE LADY HAD CONSENTED TO ACCEPT ONE HALF IN CASH AND TO WAIT A YEAR FOR THE OTHER HALF
8169-118202-0021 PAHOM FELT ENVIOUS LOOK AT THAT THOUGHT HE THE LAND IS ALL BEING SOLD AND I SHALL GET NONE OF IT SO HE SPOKE TO HIS WIFE OTHER PEOPLE ARE BUYING SAID HE
8169-118202-0022 AND WE MUST ALSO BUY TWENTY ACRES OR SO LIFE IS BECOMING IMPOSSIBLE THAT STEWARD IS SIMPLY CRUSHING US WITH HIS FINES SO THEY PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER AND CONSIDERED HOW THEY COULD MANAGE TO BUY IT THEY HAD ONE HUNDRED ROUBLES LAID BY
8169-118202-0023 THEY SOLD A COLT AND ONE HALF OF THEIR BEES HIRED OUT ONE OF THEIR SONS AS A LABORER
8169-118202-0024 HAVING DONE THIS PAHOM CHOSE OUT A FARM OF FORTY ACRES SOME OF IT WOODED AND WENT TO THE LADY TO BARGAIN FOR IT THEY CAME TO AN AGREEMENT AND HE SHOOK HANDS WITH HER UPON IT AND PAID HER A DEPOSIT IN ADVANCE
8169-118202-0025 THEN THEY WENT TO TOWN AND SIGNED THE DEEDS HE PAYING HALF THE PRICE DOWN AND UNDERTAKING TO PAY THE REMAINDER WITHIN TWO YEARS SO NOW PAHOM HAD LAND OF HIS OWN HE BORROWED SEED AND SOWED IT ON THE LAND HE HAD BOUGHT
8169-118202-0026 THE HARVEST WAS A GOOD ONE AND WITHIN A YEAR HE HAD MANAGED TO PAY OFF HIS DEBTS BOTH TO THE LADY AND TO HIS BROTHER IN LAW SO HE BECAME A LANDOWNER PLOUGHING AND SOWING HIS OWN LAND MAKING HAY ON HIS OWN LAND
8169-118202-0027 CUTTING HIS OWN TREES AND FEEDING HIS CATTLE ON HIS OWN PASTURE WHEN HE WENT OUT TO PLOUGH HIS FIELDS OR TO LOOK AT HIS GROWING CORN OR AT HIS GRASS MEADOWS HIS HEART WOULD FILL WITH JOY
8169-118202-0028 THE GRASS THAT GREW AND THE FLOWERS THAT BLOOMED THERE SEEMED TO HIM UNLIKE ANY THAT GREW ELSEWHERE FORMERLY WHEN HE HAD PASSED BY THAT LAND IT HAD APPEARED THE SAME AS ANY OTHER LAND BUT NOW IT SEEMED QUITE
8169-118202-0029 AND EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT IF THE NEIGHBORING PEASANTS WOULD ONLY NOT HAVE TRESPASSED ON HIS CORN FIELDS AND MEADOWS HE APPEALED TO THEM MOST CIVILLY BUT THEY STILL WENT ON
8169-118202-0030 NOW THE COMMUNAL HERDSMEN WOULD LET THE VILLAGE COWS STRAY INTO HIS MEADOWS THEN HORSES FROM THE NIGHT PASTURE WOULD GET AMONG HIS CORN
8169-118202-0031 PAHOM TURNED THEM OUT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND FORGAVE THEIR OWNERS AND FOR A LONG TIME HE FORBORE FROM PROSECUTING ANY ONE BUT AT LAST HE LOST PATIENCE AND COMPLAINED TO THE DISTRICT COURT
8169-118202-0032 HE KNEW IT WAS THE PEASANTS WANT OF LAND AND NO EVIL INTENT ON THEIR PART THAT CAUSED THE TROUBLE BUT HE THOUGHT I CANNOT GO ON OVERLOOKING IT OR THEY WILL DESTROY ALL I HAVE THEY MUST BE TAUGHT A LESSON
8169-118202-0033 SO HE HAD THEM UP GAVE THEM ONE LESSON AND THEN ANOTHER AND TWO OR THREE OF THE PEASANTS WERE FINED AFTER A TIME PAHOM'S NEIGHBOURS BEGAN TO BEAR HIM A GRUDGE FOR THIS
8169-118202-0034 AND WOULD NOW AND THEN LET THEIR CATTLE ON HIS LAND ON PURPOSE ONE PEASANT EVEN GOT INTO PAHOM'S WOOD AT NIGHT AND CUT DOWN FIVE YOUNG LIME TREES FOR THEIR BARK PAHOM PASSING THROUGH THE WOOD ONE DAY NOTICED SOMETHING WHITE
8169-118202-0035 HE CAME NEARER AND SAW THE STRIPPED TRUNKS LYING ON THE GROUND AND CLOSE BY STOOD THE STUMPS WHERE THE TREE HAD BEEN PAHOM WAS FURIOUS IF HE HAD ONLY CUT ONE HERE AND THERE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BAD ENOUGH THOUGHT PAHOM
8169-118202-0036 BUT THE RASCAL HAS ACTUALLY CUT DOWN A WHOLE CLUMP IF I COULD ONLY FIND OUT WHO DID THIS I WOULD PAY HIM OUT HE RACKED HIS BRAINS AS TO WHO IT COULD BE FINALLY HE DECIDED
8169-118202-0037 AND ONLY HAD AN ANGRY SCENE
8169-118202-0038 THAT SIMON HAD DONE IT AND HE LODGED A COMPLAINT SIMON WAS SUMMONED
8169-118202-0039 THERE BEING NO EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM PAHOM FELT STILL MORE AGGRIEVED AND LET HIS ANGER LOOSE UPON THE ELDER AND THE JUDGES YOU LET THIEVES GREASE YOUR PALMS SAID HE
8169-118202-0040 IF YOU WERE HONEST FOLK YOURSELVES YOU WOULD NOT LET A THIEF GO FREE SO PAHOM QUARRELLED WITH THE JUDGES AND WITH HIS NEIGHBORS THREATS TO BURN HIS BUILDING BEGAN TO BE UTTERED SO THOUGH PAHOM HAD MORE LAND
8169-118202-0041 HIS PLACE IN THE COMMUNE WAS MUCH WORSE THAN BEFORE ABOUT THIS TIME A RUMOR GOT ABOUT THAT MANY PEOPLE WERE MOVING TO NEW PARTS THERE'S NO NEED FOR ME TO LEAVE MY LAND THOUGHT PAHOM
8169-118202-0042 BUT SOME OF THE OTHERS MIGHT LEAVE OUR VILLAGE AND THEN THERE WOULD BE MORE ROOM FOR US I WOULD TAKE OVER THEIR LAND MYSELF AND MAKE MY ESTATE A BIT BIGGER I COULD THEN LIVE MORE AT EASE AS IT IS I AM STILL TOO CRAMPED TO BE COMFORTABLE
8169-118202-0043 ONE DAY PAHOM WAS SITTING AT HOME WHEN A PEASANT PASSING THROUGH THE VILLAGE HAPPENED TO CALL IN HE WAS ALLOWED TO STAY THE NIGHT AND SUPPER WAS GIVEN HIM PAHOM HAD A TALK WITH THIS PEASANT AND ASKED HIM WHERE HE CAME FROM
8169-118202-0044 THE STRANGER ANSWERED THAT HE CAME FROM BEYOND THE VOLGA WHERE HE HAD BEEN WORKING ONE WORD LED TO ANOTHER AND THE MAN WENT ON TO SAY THAT MANY PEOPLE WERE SETTLING IN THOSE PARTS HE TOLD HOW SOME PEOPLE FROM HIS VILLAGE HAD SETTLED THERE
8169-118202-0045 THEY HAD JOINED THE COMMUNE AND HAD HAD TWENTY FIVE ACRES PER MAN GRANTED THEM THE LAND WAS SO GOOD HE SAID THAT THE RYE SOWN ON IT GREW AS HIGH AS A HORSE
8169-118202-0046 AND SO THICK THAT FIVE CUTS OF A SICKLE MADE A SHEAF ONE PEASANT HE SAID HAD BROUGHT NOTHING WITH HIM BUT HIS BARE HANDS AND NOW HE HAD SIX HORSES AND TWO COWS OF HIS OWN
8169-118202-0047 PAHOM'S HEART KINDLED WITH DESIRE HE THOUGHT WHY SHOULD I SUFFER IN THIS NARROW HOLE IF ONE CAN LIVE SO WELL ELSEWHERE I WILL SELL MY LAND AND MY HOMESTEAD HERE AND WITH THE MONEY I WILL START AFRESH
8169-118202-0048 OVER THERE AND GET EVERYTHING NEW IN THIS CROWDED PLACE ONE IS ALWAYS HAVING TROUBLE BUT I MUST FIRST GO AND FIND OUT ALL ABOUT IT MYSELF TOWARDS SUMMER HE GOT READY AND STARTED
8169-118202-0049 HE WENT DOWN THE VOLGA ON A STEAMER TO SAMARA THEN WALKED ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED MILES ON FOOT AND AT LAST REACHED THE PLACE IT WAS JUST AS THE STRANGER HAD SAID THE PEASANTS HAD PLENTY OF LAND
8169-118202-0050 EVERY MAN HAD TWENTY FIVE ACRES OF COMMUNAL LAND GIVEN HIM FOR HIS USE AND ANY ONE WHO HAD MONEY COULD BUY BESIDES AT FIFTY CENTS AN ACRE AS MUCH GOOD FREEHOLD LAND AS HE WANTED
8169-118202-0051 HAVING FOUND OUT ALL HE WISHED TO KNOW PAHOM RETURNED HOME AS AUTUMN CAME ON AND BEGAN SELLING OFF HIS BELONGINGS HE SOLD HIS LAND AT A PROFIT SOLD HIS HOMESTEAD AND ALL HIS CATTLE AND WITHDREW FROM MEMBERSHIP OF THE COMMUNE
8169-118202-0052 HE APPLIED FOR ADMISSION INTO THE COMMUNE OF A LARGE VILLAGE HE STOOD TREAT TO THE ELDERS AND OBTAINED THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS FIVE SHARES OF COMMUNAL LAND WERE GIVEN HIM FOR HIS OWN AND HIS SONS USE
8169-118202-0053 BESIDES THE USE OF THE COMMUNAL PASTURE PAHOM PUT UP THE BUILDINGS HE NEEDED AND BOUGHT CATTLE OF THE COMMUNAL LAND ALONE HE HAD THREE TIMES AS MUCH AS AT HIS FORMER HOME AND THE LAND WAS GOOD CORN LAND
8169-118202-0054 HE WAS TEN TIMES BETTER OFF THAN HE HAD BEEN HE HAD PLENTY OF ARABLE LAND AND PASTURAGE AND COULD KEEP AS MANY HEAD OF CATTLE AS HE LIKED AT FIRST
8169-118202-0055 IN THE BUSTLE OF BUILDING AND SETTLING DOWN PAHOM WAS PLEASED WITH IT ALL BUT WHEN HE GOT USED TO IT HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT EVEN HERE HE HAD NOT ENOUGH LAND THE FIRST YEAR HE SOWED WHEAT ON HIS SHARE OF THE COMMUNAL LAND AND HAD A GOOD CROP
8169-118202-0056 HE WANTED TO GO ON SOWING WHEAT BUT HAD NOT ENOUGH COMMUNAL LAND FOR THE PURPOSE AND WHAT HE HAD ALREADY USED WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR IN THOSE PARTS WHEAT IS ONLY SOWN ON VIRGIN SOIL OR ON FALLOW LAND
8169-118202-0057 IT IS SOWN FOR ONE OR TWO YEARS AND THEN THE LAND LIES FALLOW TILL IT IS AGAIN OVERGROWN WITH PRAIRIE GRASS THERE WERE MANY WHO WANTED SUCH LAND AND THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR ALL SO THAT PEOPLE QUARRELLED ABOUT IT
8169-118202-0058 THOSE WHO WERE BETTER OFF WANTED IT FOR GROWING WHEAT AND THOSE WHO WERE POOR WANTED IT TO LET TO DEALERS SO THAT THEY MIGHT RAISE MONEY TO PAY THEIR TAXES
8169-118202-0059 PAHOM WANTED TO SOW MORE WHEAT SO HE RENTED LAND FROM A DEALER FOR A YEAR HE SOWED MUCH WHEAT AND HAD A FINE CROP BUT THE LAND WAS TOO FAR FROM THE VILLAGE THE WHEAT HAD TO BE CARTED MORE THAN TEN MILES
8169-118202-0060 AFTER A TIME PAHOM NOTICED THAT SOME PEASANT DEALERS WERE LIVING ON SEPARATE FARMS AND WERE GROWING WEALTHY AND HE THOUGHT IF I WERE TO BUY SOME FREEHOLD LAND AND HAVE A HOMESTEAD ON IT
8169-118202-0061 IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT THING ALTOGETHER THEN IT WOULD ALL BE NICE AND COMPACT THE QUESTION OF BUYING FREEHOLD LAND RECURRED TO HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN HE WENT ON IN THE SAME WAY FOR THREE YEARS RENTING LAND AND SOWING WHEAT
8169-118202-0062 THE SEASONS TURNED OUT WELL AND THE CROPS WERE GOOD SO THAT HE BEGAN TO LAY MONEY BY HE MIGHT HAVE GONE ON LIVING CONTENTEDLY BUT HE GREW TIRED OF HAVING TO RENT OTHER PEOPLE'S LAND EVERY YEAR AND HAVING TO SCRAMBLE FOR IT
8169-118202-0063 WHEREVER THERE WAS GOOD LAND TO BE HAD THE PEASANTS WOULD RUSH FOR IT AND IT WAS TAKEN UP AT ONCE SO THAT UNLESS YOU WERE SHARP ABOUT IT YOU GOT NONE IT HAPPENED IN THE THIRD YEAR THAT HE AND A DEALER TOGETHER RENTED A PIECE OF PASTURE LAND FROM SOME PEASANTS
8169-118202-0064 AND THEY HAD ALREADY PLOUGHED IT UP WHEN THERE WAS SOME DISPUTE AND THE PEASANTS WENT TO LAW ABOUT IT AND THINGS FELL OUT SO THAT THE LABOR WAS ALL LOST
8169-118202-0065 SO PAHOM BEGAN LOOKING OUT FOR LAND WHICH HE COULD BUY AND HE CAME ACROSS A PEASANT WHO HAD BOUGHT THIRTEEN HUNDRED ACRES BUT HAVING GOT INTO DIFFICULTIES WAS WILLING TO SELL AGAIN CHEAP PAHOM BARGAINED AND HAGGLED WITH HIM
8169-118202-0066 AND AT LAST THEY SETTLED THE PRICE AT
8169-118202-0067 PART IN CASH AND PART TO BE PAID LATER THEY HAD ALL BUT CLINCHED THE MATTER WHEN A PASSING DEALER HAPPENED TO STOP AT PAHOM'S ONE DAY TO GET A FEED FOR HIS HORSE HE DRANK TEA WITH PAHOM AND THEY HAD A TALK
8169-118202-0068 THE DEALER SAID THAT HE WAS JUST RETURNING FROM THE LAND OF THE BASHKIRS FAR AWAY WHERE HE HAD BOUGHT THIRTEEN THOUSAND ACRES OF LAND ALL FOR ONE THOUSAND ROUBLES PAHOM QUESTIONED HIM FURTHER
8169-118202-0069 AND THE TRADESMAN SAID ALL ONE NEED DO IS TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH THE CHIEFS I GAVE AWAY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED ROUBLES WORTH OF DRESSING GOWNS AND CARPETS BESIDES A CASE OF TEA
8169-118202-0070 AND I GOT THE LAND FOR LESS THAN TWO CENTS AN ACRE AND HE SHOWED PAHOM THE TITLE DEEDS SAYING THE LAND LIES NEAR A RIVER AND THE WHOLE PRAIRIE IS VIRGIN SOIL PAHOM PLIED HIM WITH QUESTIONS AND THE TRADESMAN SAID
8169-118202-0071 THEY ARE AS SIMPLE AS SHEEP AND LAND CAN BE GOT ALMOST FOR NOTHING
8169-118202-0072 WITH MY ONE THOUSAND ROUBLES WHY SHOULD I GET ONLY THIRTEEN HUNDRED ACRES AND SADDLE MYSELF WITH A DEBT BESIDES
