5242-35926-0000 THE DRINKING OF THE CUP NOW THE KING'S WORD WAS DONE THE ANGER WENT OUT OF HIS EYES AND ONCE MORE HIS COUNTENANCE GREW WEARY A COMMAND WAS ISSUED AND WITH THE MOST PERFECT ORDER MOVING LIKE ONE MAN THE REGIMENTS CHANGED THEIR ARRAY
5242-35926-0001 FORMING UP BATTALION UPON BATTALION IN FACE OF THE KING THAT THEY MIGHT GIVE HIM THE ROYAL SALUTE SO SOON AS HE HAD DRUNK THE CUP OF THE FIRST FRUITS A HERALD STOOD FORWARD AND CRIED HEARKEN YOU SONS OF FIRE HEARKEN YOU CHILDREN OF UMSUKA

5242-35926-0007 WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY TO THIS DEMAND HOKOSA NOW HOKOSA STEPPED FORWARD FROM WHERE HE STOOD AT THE HEAD OF THE COMPANY OF WIZARDS HIS DRESS LIKE THAT OF HIS COMPANIONS WAS SIMPLE BUT IN ITS WAY STRIKING ON HIS SHOULDERS HE WORE A CLOAK OF SHINING SNAKESKIN
5242-35926-0008 ABOUT HIS LOINS WAS A SHORT KILT OF THE SAME MATERIAL AND ROUND HIS FOREHEAD ARMS AND KNEES WERE FILLETS OF SNAKESKIN AT HIS SIDE HUNG HIS POUCH OF MEDICINES AND IN HIS HAND HE HELD NO SPEAR BUT A WAND OF IVORY
5242-35926-0009 WHEREOF THE TOP WAS ROUGHLY CARVED SO AS TO RESEMBLE THE HEAD OF A COBRA REARED UP TO STRIKE KING HE SAID I HAVE HEARD THE WORDS OF THE PRINCE AND I DO NOT THINK THAT THIS INSULT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT UPON THE LADY NOMA MY WARD
5242-35926-0010 OR UPON ME HER GUARDIAN STILL LET IT BE FOR I WOULD NOT THAT ONE SHOULD PASS FROM UNDER THE SHADOW OF MY HOUSE WHITHER SHE IS NOT WELCOME WITHOUT MY LEAVE THE PRINCE NAMED THIS WOMAN AS HIS QUEEN AS HE HAD THE RIGHT TO DO

5242-35926-0014 NOW THE FACE OF HAFELA GREW SULLEN AND WATCHING OWEN SAW A SWIFT CHANGE PASS OVER THAT OF HOKOSA EVIDENTLY HE WAS NOT CERTAIN OF THE WOMAN
5242-35926-0015 PRESENTLY THERE WAS A STIR AND FROM THE GATES OF THE ROYAL HOUSE THE LADY NOMA APPEARED ATTENDED BY WOMEN AND STOOD BEFORE THE KING SHE WAS A TALL AND LOVELY GIRL AND THE SUNLIGHT FLASHED UPON HER BRONZE HUED BREAST AND HER ORNAMENTS OF IVORY
5242-35926-0016 HER BLACK HAIR WAS FASTENED IN A KNOT UPON HER NECK HER FEATURES WERE FINE AND SMALL HER GAIT WAS DELICATE AND SURE AS THAT OF AN ANTELOPE AND HER EYES WERE BEAUTIFUL AND FULL OF PRIDE THERE SHE STOOD BEFORE THE KING LOOKING ROUND HER LIKE A STAG
5242-35926-0017 SEEING HER THUS OWEN UNDERSTOOD HOW IT CAME ABOUT THAT SHE HELD TWO MEN SO STRANGELY DIFFERENT IN THE HOLLOW OF HER HAND FOR HER CHARM WAS OF A NATURE TO APPEAL TO BOTH OF THEM A CHARM OF THE SPIRIT AS WELL AS OF THE FLESH AND YET THE FACE WAS HAUGHTY
5242-35926-0018 A FACE THAT UPON OCCASION MIGHT EVEN BECOME CRUEL YOU SENT FOR ME AND I AM HERE O KING SHE SAID IN A SLOW AND QUIET VOICE LISTEN GIRL ANSWERED THE KING A WHILE AGO THE PRINCE HAFELA MY SON
5242-35926-0019 NAMED YOU AS HER WHO SHOULD BE HIS QUEEN WHEREON YOU WERE TAKEN AND PLACED IN THE HOUSE OF THE ROYAL WOMEN TO ABIDE THE DAY OF YOUR MARRIAGE WHICH SHOULD BE TO MORROW
5242-35926-0020 IT IS TRUE THAT THE PRINCE HAS HONOURED ME THUS AND THAT YOU HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO APPROVE OF HIS CHOICE SHE SAID LIFTING HER EYEBROWS WHAT OF IT O KING THIS GIRL THE PRINCE WHO WAS PLEASED TO HONOUR YOU IS NOW PLEASED TO DISHONOUR YOU
5242-35926-0021 HERE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE COUNCIL AND ARMY HE PRAYS OF ME TO ANNUL HIS SEALING TO YOU AND TO SEND YOU BACK TO THE HOUSE OF YOUR GUARDIAN HOKOSA THE WIZARD NOMA STARTED AND HER FACE GREW HARD
5242-35926-0022 IS IT SO SHE SAID THEN IT WOULD SEEM THAT I HAVE LOST FAVOUR IN THE EYES OF MY LORD THE PRINCE OR THAT SOME FAIRER WOMAN HAS FOUND IT OF THESE MATTERS I KNOW NOTHING REPLIED THE KING BUT THIS I KNOW
5242-35926-0023 THAT IF YOU SEEK JUSTICE YOU SHALL HAVE IT SAY BUT THE WORD AND HE TO WHOM YOU WERE PROMISED IN MARRIAGE SHALL TAKE YOU IN MARRIAGE WHETHER HE WILLS OR WILLS IT NOT AT THIS SPEECH THE FACE OF HAFELA WAS SUDDENLY LIT UP AS WITH THE FIRE OF HOPE
5242-35926-0024 WHILE OVER THAT OF HOKOSA THERE PASSED ANOTHER SUBTLE CHANGE THE GIRL GLANCED AT THEM BOTH AND WAS SILENT FOR A WHILE HER BREAST HEAVED AND HER WHITE TEETH BIT UPON HER LIP TO OWEN WHO NOTED ALL
5242-35926-0025 IT WAS CLEAR THAT RIVAL PASSIONS WERE STRUGGLING IN HER HEART THE PASSION OF POWER AND THE PASSION OF LOVE OR OF SOME EMOTION WHICH HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOKOSA FIXED HIS CALM EYES UPON HER WITH A STRANGE INTENSITY OF GAZE
5242-35926-0026 MUCH AS A SNAKE QUIVERS THAT IS ABOUT TO STRIKE ITS PREY TO THE CARELESS EYE THERE WAS NOTHING REMARKABLE ABOUT HIS LOOK AND ATTITUDE TO THE OBSERVER IT WAS EVIDENT THAT BOTH WERE FULL OF EXTRAORDINARY PURPOSE
5242-35926-0027 HE WAS TALKING TO THE GIRL NOT WITH WORDS BUT IN SOME SECRET LANGUAGE THAT HE AND SHE UNDERSTOOD ALONE SHE STARTED AS ONE STARTS WHO CATCHES THE TONE OF A WELL REMEMBERED VOICE IN A CROWD OF STRANGERS AND LIFTING HER EYES FROM THE GROUND WHITHER SHE HAD TURNED THEM IN MEDITATION
5242-35926-0028 SHE LOOKED UP AT HOKOSA INSTANTLY HER FACE BEGAN TO CHANGE THE HAUGHTINESS AND ANGER WENT OUT OF IT IT GREW TROUBLED THE LIPS PARTED IN A SIGH FIRST SHE BENT HER HEAD AND BODY TOWARDS HIM
5242-35926-0029 THEN WITHOUT MORE ADO SHE WALKED TO WHERE HE STOOD AND TOOK HIM BY THE HAND HERE AT SOME WHISPERED WORD OR SIGN SHE SEEMED TO RECOVER HERSELF AND AGAIN RESUMING THE CHARACTER OF A PROUD OFFENDED BEAUTY SHE CURTSEYED TO UMSUKA AND SPOKE
5242-35926-0030 O KING AS YOU SEE I HAVE MADE MY CHOICE I WILL NOT FORCE MYSELF UPON A MAN WHO SCORNS ME NO NOT EVEN TO SHARE HIS PLACE AND POWER THOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT I LOVE THEM BOTH
5242-35926-0031 NAY I WILL RETURN TO HOKOSA MY GUARDIAN AND TO HIS WIFE ZINTI WHO HAS BEEN AS MY MOTHER AND WITH THEM BE AT PEACE IT IS WELL SAID THE KING AND PERHAPS GIRL YOUR CHOICE IS WISE
5242-35926-0032 PERHAPS YOUR LOSS IS NOT SO GREAT AS YOU HAVE THOUGHT HAFELA TAKE YOU THE HAND OF HOKOSA AND RELEASE THE GIRL BACK TO HIM ACCORDING TO THE LAW PROMISING IN THE EARS OF MEN BEFORE THE FIRST MONTH OF WINTER
5242-35926-0033 TO PAY HIM TWO HUNDRED HEAD OF CATTLE AS FORFEIT TO BE HELD BY HIM IN TRUST FOR THE GIRL IN A SULLEN VOICE HIS LIPS TREMBLING WITH RAGE HAFELA DID AS THE KING COMMANDED AND WHEN THE HANDS OF THE CONSPIRATORS UNCLASPED
5242-35926-0034 OWEN PERCEIVED THAT IN THAT OF THE PRINCE LAY A TINY PACKET MIX ME THE CUP OF THE FIRST FRUITS AND SWIFTLY SAID THE KING AGAIN FOR THE SUN GROWS LOW IN THE HEAVENS AND ERE IT SINKS I HAVE WORDS TO SAY
5242-35926-0035 NOW A POLISHED GOURD FILLED WITH NATIVE BEER WAS HANDED TO NODWENGO THE SECOND SON OF THE KING AND ONE BY ONE THE GREAT COUNCILLORS APPROACHED AND WITH APPROPRIATE WORDS LET FALL INTO IT OFFERINGS EMBLEMATIC OF FERTILITY AND INCREASE
5242-35926-0036 THE FIRST CAST IN A GRAIN OF CORN THE SECOND A BLADE OF GRASS THE THIRD A SHAVING FROM AN OX'S HORN THE FOURTH A DROP OF WATER THE FIFTH A WOMAN'S HAIR THE SIXTH A PARTICLE OF EARTH AND SO ON
5242-35926-0037 UNTIL EVERY INGREDIENT WAS ADDED TO IT THAT WAS NECESSARY TO THE MAGIC BREW THEN HOKOSA AS CHIEF OF THE MEDICINE MEN BLESSED THE CUP ACCORDING TO THE ANCIENT FORMS PRAYING THAT HE WHOSE BODY WAS THE HEAVENS WHOSE EYES WERE LIGHTNING
5242-35926-0038 AND WHOSE VOICE WAS THUNDER THE SPIRIT WHOM THEY WORSHIPPED MIGHT INCREASE AND MULTIPLY TO THEM DURING THE COMING YEAR ALL THOSE FRUITS AND ELEMENTS THAT WERE PRESENT IN THE CUP AND THAT EVERY VIRTUE WHICH THEY CONTAINED MIGHT COMFORT THE BODY OF THE KING
5242-35926-0039 HIS PRAYER FINISHED IT WAS THE TURN OF HAFELA TO PLAY HIS PART AS THE ELDEST BORN OF THE KING KNEELING OVER THE CUP WHICH STOOD UPON THE GROUND A SPEAR WAS HANDED TO HIM THAT HAD BEEN MADE RED HOT IN THE FIRE
5242-35926-0040 TAKING THE SPEAR HE STABBED WITH IT TOWARDS THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THE HORIZON THEN MUTTERING SOME INVOCATION HE PLUNGED IT INTO THE BOWL STIRRING ITS CONTENTS TILL THE IRON GREW BLACK NOW HE THREW ASIDE THE SPEAR
5242-35926-0041 AND LIFTING THE BOWL IN BOTH HANDS HE CARRIED IT TO HIS FATHER AND OFFERED IT TO HIM ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO SEE HIM DROP THE POISON INTO THE CUP A GLANCE AT HAFELA TOLD OWEN THAT IT WAS THERE
5242-35926-0042 HE COULD NOT PREVENT HIS HANDS FROM TWITCHING OR THE SWEAT FROM STARTING UPON HIS BROW AND BREAST THE KING ROSE AND TAKING THE BOWL HELD IT ON HIGH SAYING IN THIS CUP WHICH I DRINK ON BEHALF OF THE NATION
5242-35926-0043 IT WAS THE SIGNAL FOR THE ROYAL SALUTE FOR WHICH EACH REGIMENT HAD BEEN PREPARED AS THE LAST WORD LEFT THE KING'S LIPS EVERY ONE OF THE THIRTY THOUSAND MEN PRESENT IN THAT GREAT PLACE BEGAN TO RATTLE HIS KERRY AGAINST THE SURFACE OF HIS OX HIDE SHIELD
5242-35926-0044 AT FIRST THE SOUND PRODUCED RESEMBLED THAT OF THE MURMUR OF THE SEA BUT BY SLOW AND JUST DEGREES IT GREW LOUDER AND EVER LOUDER TILL THE ROAR OF IT WAS LIKE THE DEEPEST VOICE OF THUNDER A SOUND AWE INSPIRING TERRIBLE
5242-35926-0045 SUDDENLY WHEN ITS VOLUME WAS MOST FOUR SPEARS WERE THROWN INTO THE AIR AND AT THIS SIGNAL EVERY MAN CEASED TO BEAT UPON HIS SHIELD IN THE PLACE ITSELF THERE WAS SILENCE BUT FROM THE MOUNTAINS AROUND THE ECHOES STILL CRASHED AND VOLLEYED
5242-35926-0046 WHEN THE LAST OF THEM HAD DIED AWAY THE KING BROUGHT THE CUP TO THE LEVEL OF HIS LIPS OWEN SAW
5242-35926-0047 INDEED HIS ARM WAS LIFTED AND HIS MOUTH WAS OPEN
5242-35926-0048 AND REMEMBERED TO ACT NOW WOULD BE MADNESS HIS TIME HAD NOT YET COME THE CUP TOUCHED THE KING'S LIPS AND AT THE SIGN FROM EVERY THROAT IN THAT COUNTLESS MULTITUDE SPRANG THE WORD KING AND EVERY FOOT STAMPED UPON THE GROUND SHAKING THE SOLID EARTH
5242-35926-0049 THRICE THE MONARCH DRANK AND THRICE THIS TREMENDOUS SALUTE THE SALUTE OF THE WHOLE NATION TO ITS RULER WAS REPEATED EACH TIME MORE LOUDLY THAN THE LAST THEN POURING THE REST OF THE LIQUOR ON THE GROUND UMSUKA SET ASIDE THE CUP
5242-35926-0050 AND IN THE MIDST OF A SILENCE THAT SEEMED DEEP AFTER THE CRASH OF THE GREAT SALUTE HE BEGAN TO ADDRESS THE MULTITUDE HEARKEN COUNCILLORS AND CAPTAINS AND YOU MY PEOPLE HEARKEN
5242-35926-0051 AS YOU KNOW I HAVE TWO SONS CALVES OF THE BLACK BULL PRINCES OF THE LAND MY SON HAFELA THE ELDEST BORN AND MY SON NODWENGO HIS HALF BROTHER AT THIS POINT THE KING BEGAN TO GROW CONFUSED
5242-35926-0052 HE HESITATED PASSING HIS HAND OVER HIS EYES THEN SLOWLY AND WITH DIFFICULTY REPEATED THOSE WORDS WHICH HE HAD ALREADY SAID WE HEAR YOU FATHER CRIED THE COUNCILLORS IN ENCOURAGEMENT AS FOR THE SECOND TIME HE PAUSED
