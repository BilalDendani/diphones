779-123709-0000 I WANT NOW TO TELL YOU GENTLEMEN WHETHER YOU CARE TO HEAR IT OR NOT WHY I COULD NOT EVEN BECOME AN INSECT I TELL YOU SOLEMNLY THAT I HAVE MANY TIMES TRIED TO BECOME AN INSECT BUT I WAS NOT EQUAL EVEN TO THAT I SWEAR GENTLEMEN
779-123709-0001 OF OUR UNHAPPY NINETEENTH CENTURY ESPECIALLY ONE WHO HAS THE FATAL ILL LUCK TO INHABIT PETERSBURG THE MOST THEORETICAL AND INTENTIONAL TOWN ON THE WHOLE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE THERE ARE INTENTIONAL AND UNINTENTIONAL TOWNS
779-123709-0002 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE ENOUGH FOR INSTANCE TO HAVE THE CONSCIOUSNESS BY WHICH ALL SO CALLED DIRECT PERSONS AND MEN OF ACTION LIVE I BET YOU THINK I AM WRITING ALL THIS FROM AFFECTATION TO BE WITTY AT THE EXPENSE OF MEN OF ACTION
779-123709-0003 AND WHAT IS MORE THAT FROM ILL BRED AFFECTATION I AM CLANKING A SWORD LIKE MY OFFICER BUT GENTLEMEN WHOEVER CAN PRIDE HIMSELF ON HIS DISEASES AND EVEN SWAGGER OVER THEM THOUGH AFTER ALL EVERYONE DOES DO THAT
779-123709-0004 PEOPLE DO PRIDE THEMSELVES ON THEIR DISEASES AND I DO MAY BE MORE THAN ANYONE WE WILL NOT DISPUTE IT MY CONTENTION WAS ABSURD BUT YET I AM FIRMLY PERSUADED THAT A GREAT DEAL OF CONSCIOUSNESS
779-123709-0005 EVERY SORT OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN FACT IS A DISEASE I STICK TO THAT LET US LEAVE THAT TOO FOR A MINUTE TELL ME THIS WHY DOES IT HAPPEN THAT AT THE VERY YES AT THE VERY MOMENTS
779-123709-0006 WHEN I AM MOST CAPABLE OF FEELING EVERY REFINEMENT OF ALL THAT IS SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL AS THEY USED TO SAY AT ONE TIME IT WOULD AS THOUGH OF DESIGN HAPPEN TO ME NOT ONLY TO FEEL BUT TO DO SUCH UGLY THINGS SUCH THAT
779-123709-0007 WELL IN SHORT ACTIONS THAT ALL PERHAPS COMMIT BUT WHICH AS THOUGH PURPOSELY OCCURRED TO ME AT THE VERY TIME WHEN I WAS MOST CONSCIOUS THAT THEY OUGHT NOT TO BE COMMITTED THE MORE CONSCIOUS I WAS OF GOODNESS
779-123709-0008 AND OF ALL THAT WAS SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL THE MORE DEEPLY I SANK INTO MY MIRE AND THE MORE READY I WAS TO SINK IN IT ALTOGETHER BUT THE CHIEF POINT WAS THAT ALL THIS WAS AS IT WERE NOT ACCIDENTAL IN ME BUT AS THOUGH IT WERE BOUND TO BE SO
779-123709-0009 IT WAS AS THOUGH IT WERE MY MOST NORMAL CONDITION AND NOT IN THE LEAST DISEASE OR DEPRAVITY SO THAT AT LAST ALL DESIRE IN ME TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS DEPRAVITY PASSED IT ENDED BY MY ALMOST BELIEVING PERHAPS ACTUALLY BELIEVING
779-123709-0010 THAT THIS WAS PERHAPS MY NORMAL CONDITION BUT AT FIRST IN THE BEGINNING WHAT AGONIES I ENDURED IN THAT STRUGGLE I DID NOT BELIEVE IT WAS THE SAME WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND ALL MY LIFE I HID THIS FACT ABOUT MYSELF AS A SECRET
779-123709-0011 I WAS ASHAMED EVEN NOW PERHAPS I AM ASHAMED I GOT TO THE POINT OF FEELING A SORT OF SECRET ABNORMAL DESPICABLE ENJOYMENT IN RETURNING HOME TO MY CORNER ON SOME DISGUSTING PETERSBURG NIGHT
779-123709-0012 ACUTELY CONSCIOUS THAT THAT DAY I HAD COMMITTED A LOATHSOME ACTION AGAIN THAT WHAT WAS DONE COULD NEVER BE UNDONE AND SECRETLY INWARDLY GNAWING GNAWING AT MYSELF FOR IT
779-123709-0013 AND AT LAST INTO POSITIVE REAL ENJOYMENT YES INTO ENJOYMENT INTO ENJOYMENT I INSIST UPON THAT I HAVE SPOKEN OF THIS BECAUSE I KEEP WANTING TO KNOW FOR A FACT WHETHER OTHER PEOPLE FEEL SUCH ENJOYMENT I WILL EXPLAIN
779-123709-0014 THE ENJOYMENT WAS JUST FROM THE TOO INTENSE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ONE'S OWN DEGRADATION IT WAS FROM FEELING ONESELF THAT ONE HAD REACHED THE LAST BARRIER THAT IT WAS HORRIBLE BUT THAT IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE THAT THERE WAS NO ESCAPE FOR YOU
779-123709-0015 THAT YOU NEVER COULD BECOME A DIFFERENT MAN THAT EVEN IF TIME AND FAITH WERE STILL LEFT YOU TO CHANGE INTO SOMETHING DIFFERENT YOU WOULD MOST LIKELY NOT WISH TO CHANGE OR IF YOU DID WISH TO EVEN THEN YOU WOULD DO NOTHING
779-123709-0016 BECAUSE PERHAPS IN REALITY THERE WAS NOTHING FOR YOU TO CHANGE INTO AND THE WORST OF IT WAS AND THE ROOT OF IT ALL THAT IT WAS ALL IN ACCORD WITH THE NORMAL FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF OVER ACUTE CONSCIOUSNESS
779-123709-0017 AND WITH THE INERTIA THAT WAS THE DIRECT RESULT OF THOSE LAWS AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY ONE WAS NOT ONLY UNABLE TO CHANGE BUT COULD DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THUS IT WOULD FOLLOW
779-123709-0018 THAT ONE IS NOT TO BLAME IN BEING A SCOUNDREL AS THOUGH THAT WERE ANY CONSOLATION TO THE SCOUNDREL ONCE HE HAS COME TO REALISE THAT HE ACTUALLY IS A SCOUNDREL BUT ENOUGH ECH I HAVE TALKED A LOT OF NONSENSE BUT WHAT HAVE I EXPLAINED
779-123709-0019 HOW IS ENJOYMENT IN THIS TO BE EXPLAINED BUT I WILL EXPLAIN IT I WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT THAT IS WHY I HAVE TAKEN UP MY PEN I FOR INSTANCE HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF AMOUR PROPRE
779-123709-0020 I AM AS SUSPICIOUS AND PRONE TO TAKE OFFENCE AS A HUMPBACK OR A DWARF BUT UPON MY WORD I SOMETIMES HAVE HAD MOMENTS WHEN IF I HAD HAPPENED TO BE SLAPPED IN THE FACE I SHOULD PERHAPS HAVE BEEN POSITIVELY GLAD OF IT I SAY
779-123709-0021 IN EARNEST THAT I SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER EVEN IN THAT A PECULIAR SORT OF ENJOYMENT THE ENJOYMENT OF COURSE OF DESPAIR BUT IN DESPAIR THERE ARE THE MOST INTENSE ENJOYMENTS
779-123709-0022 LOOK AT IT WHICH WAY ONE WILL IT STILL TURNS OUT THAT I WAS ALWAYS THE MOST TO BLAME IN EVERYTHING AND WHAT IS MOST HUMILIATING OF ALL TO BLAME FOR NO FAULT OF MY OWN BUT SO TO SAY THROUGH THE LAWS OF NATURE
779-123709-0023 IN THE FIRST PLACE TO BLAME BECAUSE I AM CLEVERER THAN ANY OF THE PEOPLE SURROUNDING ME I HAVE ALWAYS CONSIDERED MYSELF CLEVERER THAN ANY OF THE PEOPLE SURROUNDING ME AND SOMETIMES WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT HAVE BEEN POSITIVELY ASHAMED OF IT AT ANY RATE
779-123709-0024 I HAVE ALL MY LIFE AS IT WERE TURNED MY EYES AWAY AND NEVER COULD LOOK PEOPLE STRAIGHT IN THE FACE TO BLAME FINALLY BECAUSE EVEN IF I HAD HAD MAGNANIMITY I SHOULD ONLY HAVE HAD MORE SUFFERING FROM THE SENSE OF ITS USELESSNESS
779-123709-0025 I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DO ANYTHING FROM BEING MAGNANIMOUS NEITHER TO FORGIVE FOR MY ASSAILANT WOULD PERHAPS HAVE SLAPPED ME FROM THE LAWS OF NATURE AND ONE CANNOT FORGIVE THE LAWS OF NATURE NOR TO FORGET
779-123709-0026 FOR EVEN IF IT WERE OWING TO THE LAWS OF NATURE IT IS INSULTING ALL THE SAME FINALLY EVEN IF I HAD WANTED TO BE ANYTHING BUT MAGNANIMOUS HAD DESIRED ON THE CONTRARY TO REVENGE MYSELF ON MY ASSAILANT
779-123709-0027 I COULD NOT HAVE REVENGED MYSELF ON ANY ONE FOR ANYTHING BECAUSE I SHOULD CERTAINLY NEVER HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO DO ANYTHING EVEN IF I HAD BEEN ABLE TO WHY SHOULD I NOT HAVE MADE UP MY MIND
