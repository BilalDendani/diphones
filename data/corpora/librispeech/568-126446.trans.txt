568-126446-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE DOOMED TO DIE FOR AN INSTANT I STOOD THERE BEFORE THEY FELL UPON ME BUT THE FIRST RUSH OF THEM FORCED ME BACK A STEP OR TWO MY FOOT FELT FOR THE FLOOR BUT FOUND ONLY EMPTY SPACE
568-126446-0001 I HAD BACKED INTO THE PIT WHICH HAD RECEIVED ISSUS FOR A SECOND I TOPPLED THERE UPON THE BRINK THEN I TOO WITH THE BOY STILL TIGHTLY CLUTCHED IN MY ARMS PITCHED BACKWARD INTO THE BLACK ABYSS WE STRUCK A POLISHED CHUTE
568-126446-0002 THE OPENING ABOVE US CLOSED AS MAGICALLY AS IT HAD OPENED AND WE SHOT DOWN UNHARMED INTO A DIMLY LIGHTED APARTMENT FAR BELOW THE ARENA AS I ROSE TO MY FEET THE FIRST THING I SAW WAS THE MALIGNANT COUNTENANCE OF ISSUS GLARING AT ME
568-126446-0003 THROUGH THE HEAVY BARS OF A GRATED DOOR AT ONE SIDE OF THE CHAMBER RASH MORTAL SHE SHRILLED YOU SHALL PAY THE AWFUL PENALTY FOR YOUR BLASPHEMY IN THIS SECRET CELL HERE YOU SHALL LIE ALONE AND IN DARKNESS WITH THE CARCASS OF YOUR ACCOMPLICE
568-126446-0004 FESTERING IN ITS ROTTENNESS BY YOUR SIDE UNTIL CRAZED BY LONELINESS AND HUNGER YOU FEED UPON THE CRAWLING MAGGOTS THAT WERE ONCE A MAN THAT WAS ALL IN ANOTHER INSTANT SHE WAS GONE AND THE DIM LIGHT WHICH HAD FILLED THE CELL
568-126446-0005 BLACKNESS PLEASANT OLD LADY SAID A VOICE AT MY SIDE WHO SPEAKS I ASKED TIS I YOUR COMPANION WHO HAS HAD THE HONOUR THIS DAY OF FIGHTING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH THE GREATEST WARRIOR THAT EVER WORE METAL UPON BARSOOM
568-126446-0006 I THANK GOD THAT YOU ARE NOT DEAD I SAID I FEARED FOR THAT NASTY CUT UPON YOUR HEAD IT BUT STUNNED ME HE REPLIED A MERE SCRATCH MAYBE IT WERE AS WELL HAD IT BEEN FINAL I SAID
568-126446-0007 WE SEEM TO BE IN A PRETTY FIX HERE WITH A SPLENDID CHANCE OF DYING OF STARVATION AND THIRST WHERE ARE WE BENEATH THE ARENA I REPLIED WE TUMBLED DOWN THE SHAFT THAT SWALLOWED ISSUS AS SHE WAS ALMOST AT OUR MERCY
568-126446-0008 HE LAUGHED A LOW LAUGH OF PLEASURE AND RELIEF AND THEN REACHING OUT THROUGH THE INKY BLACKNESS HE SOUGHT MY SHOULDER AND PULLED MY EAR CLOSE TO HIS MOUTH NOTHING COULD BE BETTER HE WHISPERED THERE ARE SECRETS WITHIN THE SECRETS OF ISSUS OF WHICH
568-126446-0009 ISSUS HERSELF DOES NOT DREAM
568-126446-0010 I LABOURED WITH THE OTHER SLAVES A YEAR SINCE IN THE REMODELLING OF THESE SUBTERRANEAN GALLERIES AND AT THAT TIME WE FOUND BELOW THESE AN ANCIENT SYSTEM OF CORRIDORS AND CHAMBERS THAT HAD BEEN SEALED UP FOR AGES THE BLACKS IN CHARGE OF THE WORK EXPLORED THEM
568-126446-0011 TAKING SEVERAL OF US ALONG TO DO WHATEVER WORK THERE MIGHT BE OCCASION FOR I KNOW THE ENTIRE SYSTEM PERFECTLY THERE ARE MILES OF CORRIDORS HONEYCOMBING THE GROUND BENEATH THE GARDENS AND THE TEMPLE ITSELF
568-126446-0012 WHERE THE BLACKS NEVER GO THERE WE MAY LIVE FOR A TIME AND WHO KNOWS WHAT MAY TRANSPIRE TO AID US TO ESCAPE HE HAD SPOKEN ALL IN A LOW WHISPER EVIDENTLY FEARING SPYING EARS EVEN HERE AND SO I ANSWERED HIM IN THE SAME SUBDUED TONE
568-126446-0013 SO I CANNOT DESERT HIM NO SAID THE BOY ONE CANNOT DESERT A FRIEND IT WERE BETTER TO BE RECAPTURED OURSELVES THAN THAT THEN HE COMMENCED GROPING HIS WAY ABOUT THE FLOOR OF THE DARK CHAMBER
568-126446-0014 ON A LEVEL FLOOR OF SOFT SAND VERY QUIETLY I LOWERED MYSELF FROM THE INKY CELL ABOVE INTO THE INKY PIT BELOW SO UTTERLY DARK WAS IT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE OUR HANDS AT AN INCH FROM OUR NOSES NEVER I THINK
568-126446-0015 HAVE I KNOWN SUCH COMPLETE ABSENCE OF LIGHT AS EXISTED IN THE PITS OF ISSUS FOR AN INSTANT I HUNG IN MID AIR THERE IS A STRANGE SENSATION CONNECTED WITH AN EXPERIENCE OF THAT NATURE WHICH IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE
568-126446-0016 WHEN THE FEET TREAD EMPTY AIR AND THE DISTANCE BELOW IS SHROUDED IN DARKNESS THERE IS A FEELING AKIN TO PANIC AT THE THOUGHT OF RELEASING THE HOLD AND TAKING THE PLUNGE INTO UNKNOWN DEPTHS ALTHOUGH THE BOY HAD TOLD ME THAT IT WAS BUT TEN FEET TO THE FLOOR BELOW
568-126446-0017 I EXPERIENCED THE SAME THRILLS AS THOUGH I WERE HANGING ABOVE A BOTTOMLESS PIT THEN I RELEASED MY HOLD AND DROPPED FOUR FEET TO A SOFT CUSHION OF SAND
568-126446-0018 AND I WILL REPLACE THE TRAP THIS DONE HE TOOK ME BY THE HAND LEADING ME VERY SLOWLY WITH MUCH FEELING ABOUT AND FREQUENT HALTS TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HE DID NOT STRAY INTO WRONG PASSAGEWAYS
568-126446-0019 PRESENTLY WE COMMENCED THE DESCENT OF A VERY STEEP INCLINE IT WILL NOT BE LONG HE SAID BEFORE WE SHALL HAVE LIGHT AT THE LOWER LEVELS WE MEET THE SAME STRATUM OF PHOSPHORESCENT ROCK THAT ILLUMINATES OMEAN
568-126446-0020 NEVER SHALL I FORGET THAT TRIP THROUGH THE PITS OF ISSUS WHILE IT WAS DEVOID OF IMPORTANT INCIDENTS YET IT WAS FILLED FOR ME WITH A STRANGE CHARM OF EXCITEMENT AND ADVENTURE
568-126446-0021 ON THE UNGUESSABLE ANTIQUITY OF THESE LONG FORGOTTEN CORRIDORS THE THINGS WHICH THE STYGIAN DARKNESS HID FROM MY OBJECTIVE EYE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HALF SO WONDERFUL AS THE PICTURES WHICH MY IMAGINATION WROUGHT AS IT CONJURED TO LIFE AGAIN THE ANCIENT PEOPLES
568-126446-0022 OF THIS DYING WORLD AND SET THEM ONCE MORE TO THE LABOURS THE INTRIGUES THE MYSTERIES AND THE CRUELTIES
568-126446-0023 OF THE DEAD SEA BOTTOMS THAT HAD DRIVEN THEM STEP BY STEP TO THE UTTERMOST PINNACLE OF THE WORLD WHERE THEY WERE NOW INTRENCHED BEHIND AN IMPENETRABLE BARRIER OF SUPERSTITION IN ADDITION TO THE GREEN MEN THERE HAD BEEN THREE PRINCIPAL RACES UPON BARSOOM
568-126446-0024 THE VARIOUS RACES HAD MADE WAR UPON ONE ANOTHER FOR AGES AND THE THREE HIGHER TYPES HAD EASILY BESTED THE GREEN SAVAGES OF THE WATER PLACES OF THE WORLD BUT NOW THAT THE RECEDING SEAS NECESSITATED CONSTANT ABANDONMENT OF THEIR FORTIFIED CITIES
568-126446-0025 THE RESULT OF WHICH IS SHOWN IN THE PRESENT SPLENDID RACE OF RED MEN I HAD ALWAYS SUPPOSED THAT ALL TRACES OF THE ORIGINAL RACES HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE FACE OF MARS YET WITHIN THE PAST FOUR DAYS I HAD FOUND BOTH WHITES AND BLACKS IN GREAT MULTITUDES
568-126446-0026 COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT IN SOME FAR OFF CORNER OF THE PLANET THERE STILL EXISTED A REMNANT OF THE ANCIENT RACE OF YELLOW MEN MY REVERIES WERE BROKEN IN UPON BY A LOW EXCLAMATION FROM THE BOY AT LAST THE LIGHTED WAY HE CRIED
568-126446-0027 AND LOOKING UP I BEHELD AT A LONG DISTANCE BEFORE US A DIM RADIANCE AS WE ADVANCED THE LIGHT INCREASED UNTIL PRESENTLY WE EMERGED INTO WELL LIGHTED PASSAGEWAYS FROM THEN ON OUR PROGRESS WAS RAPID UNTIL WE CAME SUDDENLY TO THE END OF A CORRIDOR
568-126446-0028 I WAS CLOSE AT HIS HEELS SILENTLY WE DROPPED TO THE DESERTED DECK AND ON HANDS AND KNEES CRAWLED TOWARD THE HATCHWAY A STEALTHY GLANCE BELOW REVEALED NO GUARD IN SIGHT AND SO WITH THE QUICKNESS AND THE SOUNDLESSNESS
568-126446-0029 OF CATS WE DROPPED TOGETHER INTO THE MAIN CABIN OF THE SUBMARINE EVEN HERE WAS NO SIGN OF LIFE QUICKLY WE COVERED AND SECURED THE HATCH THEN THE BOY STEPPED INTO THE PILOT HOUSE TOUCHED A BUTTON AND THE BOAT SANK AMID SWIRLING WATERS TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
568-126446-0030 EVEN THEN THERE WAS NO SCURRYING OF FEET AS WE HAD EXPECTED AND WHILE THE BOY REMAINED TO DIRECT THE BOAT I SLID FROM CABIN TO CABIN IN FUTILE SEARCH FOR SOME MEMBER OF THE CREW
568-126446-0031 ONLY OUR FIRST ANCESTOR KNOWS HE REPLIED WE REACHED THE SUBMARINE POOL IN OMEAN WITHOUT INCIDENT HERE WE DEBATED THE WISDOM OF SINKING THE CRAFT BEFORE LEAVING HER BUT FINALLY DECIDED THAT IT WOULD ADD NOTHING TO OUR CHANCES FOR ESCAPE
568-126446-0032 THERE WERE PLENTY OF BLACKS ON OMEAN TO THWART US WERE WE APPREHENDED HOWEVER MANY MORE MIGHT COME FROM THE TEMPLES AND GARDENS OF ISSUS WOULD NOT IN ANY WAY DECREASE OUR CHANCES
568-126446-0033 WE WERE NOW IN A QUANDARY AS TO HOW TO PASS THE GUARDS WHO PATROLLED THE ISLAND ABOUT THE POOL AT LAST I HIT UPON A PLAN
568-126446-0034 YERSTED THAT WILL BE THE SIMPLER WAY TO RETURN I SAID SMILING AS I HANDED THE FORGED ORDER TO THE BOY COME WE SHALL SEE NOW HOW WELL IT WORKS BUT OUR SWORDS HE EXCLAIMED WHAT SHALL WE SAY TO EXPLAIN THEM
568-126446-0035 SINCE WE CANNOT EXPLAIN THEM WE SHALL HAVE TO LEAVE THEM BEHIND US I REPLIED IS IT NOT THE
568-126446-0036 IN THE POWER OF THE FIRST BORN IT IS THE ONLY WAY I ANSWERED
568-126446-0037 AND I THINK ONCE OUT THAT WE SHALL FIND NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IN ARMING OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN A COUNTRY WHICH ABOUNDS SO PLENTIFULLY IN ARMED MEN AS YOU SAY HE REPLIED WITH A SMILE AND SHRUG
568-126446-0038 I COULD NOT FOLLOW ANOTHER LEADER WHO INSPIRED GREATER CONFIDENCE THAN YOU COME LET US PUT YOUR RUSE TO THE TEST BOLDLY WE EMERGED FROM THE HATCHWAY OF THE CRAFT LEAVING OUR SWORDS BEHIND US AND STRODE TO THE MAIN EXIT WHICH LED TO THE SENTRY'S POST
568-126446-0039 AT SIGHT OF US THE MEMBERS OF THE GUARD SPRANG FORWARD IN SURPRISE AND WITH LEVELLED RIFLES HALTED US I HELD OUT THE MESSAGE TO ONE OF THEM HE TOOK IT AND SEEING TO WHOM IT WAS ADDRESSED TURNED AND HANDED IT TO TORITH
568-126446-0040 WHO WAS EMERGING FROM HIS OFFICE TO LEARN THE CAUSE OF THE COMMOTION THE BLACK READ THE ORDER AND FOR A MOMENT EYED US WITH EVIDENT SUSPICION
568-126446-0041 AND MY HEART SANK WITHIN ME AS I CURSED MYSELF FOR A STUPID FOOL IN NOT HAVING SUNK THE SUBMARINE TO MAKE GOOD THE LIE THAT I MUST TELL HIS ORDERS WERE TO RETURN IMMEDIATELY TO THE TEMPLE LANDING I REPLIED
568-126446-0042 TORITH TOOK A HALF STEP TOWARD THE ENTRANCE TO THE POOL AS THOUGH TO CORROBORATE MY STORY FOR THAT INSTANT EVERYTHING HUNG IN THE BALANCE FOR HAD HE DONE SO AND FOUND THE EMPTY SUBMARINE STILL LYING AT HER WHARF THE WHOLE WEAK FABRIC OF MY CONCOCTION
568-126446-0043 WOULD HAVE TUMBLED ABOUT OUR HEADS BUT EVIDENTLY HE DECIDED THE MESSAGE MUST BE GENUINE NOR INDEED WAS THERE ANY GOOD REASON TO DOUBT IT SINCE IT WOULD SCARCE HAVE SEEMED CREDIBLE TO HIM THAT TWO SLAVES WOULD VOLUNTARILY HAVE GIVEN THEMSELVES INTO CUSTODY IN ANY SUCH MANNER AS THIS
568-126446-0044 IT WAS THE VERY BOLDNESS OF THE PLAN WHICH RENDERED IT SUCCESSFUL WERE YOU CONNECTED WITH THE RISING OF THE SLAVES ASKED TORITH WE HAVE JUST HAD MEAGRE REPORTS OF SOME SUCH EVENT ALL WERE INVOLVED I REPLIED BUT IT AMOUNTED TO LITTLE
568-126446-0045 THE GUARDS QUICKLY OVERCAME AND KILLED THE MAJORITY OF US HE SEEMED SATISFIED WITH THIS REPLY TAKE THEM TO SHADOR HE ORDERED TURNING TO ONE OF HIS SUBORDINATES
