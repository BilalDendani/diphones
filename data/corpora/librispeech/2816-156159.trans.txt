2816-156159-0000 MY COMRADE WAS A CAPITAL GRECIAN IT IS TRUE THAT HIS SINGULAR MIND SO ORDERED AND DISPOSED HIS CLASSIC LORE AS TO IMPRESS IT WITH SOMETHING OF AN ORIGINAL AND BARBAROUS CHARACTERWITH
2816-156159-0001 MORE PROPERLY BELONGING TO A RICH NATIVE BALLAD THAN TO THE POETRY OF HELLAS THERE WAS A CERTAIN IMPROPRIETY IN HIS KNOWING SO MUCH GREEKAN UNFITNESS IN THE IDEA OF MARBLE FAUNS AND SATYRS
2816-156159-0002 AND EVEN OLYMPIAN GODS LUGGED IN UNDER THE OAKEN ROOF AND THE PAINTED LIGHT OF AN ODD OLD NORMAN HALL BUT METHLEY ABOUNDING IN HOMER REALLY LOVED HIM AS I BELIEVE IN ALL TRUTH WITHOUT WHIM OR FANCY
2816-156159-0003 MOREOVER HE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE PRACTICAL SAGACITY OF A YORKSHIREMAN HIPPODAMOIO
2816-156159-0004 I TOO LOVED HOMER BUT NOT WITH A SCHOLARS LOVE THE MOST HUMBLE AND PIOUS AMONG WOMEN WAS YET SO PROUD A MOTHER THAT SHE COULD TEACH HER FIRSTBORN SON NO WATTS HYMNS NO COLLECTS FOR THE DAY
2816-156159-0005 SHE COULD TEACH HIM IN EARLIEST CHILDHOOD NO LESS THAN THIS TO FIND A HOME IN HIS SADDLE AND TO LOVE OLD HOMER AND ALL THAT OLD HOMER SUNG TRUE IT IS THAT THE GREEK WAS INGENIOUSLY RENDERED INTO ENGLISH THE ENGLISH OF POPE EVEN
2816-156159-0006 BUT NOT EVEN A MESH LIKE THAT CAN SCREEN AN EARNEST CHILD FROM THE FIRE OF HOMERS BATTLES I PORED OVER THE ODYSSEY AS OVER A STORY BOOK HOPING AND FEARING FOR THE HERO WHOM YET I PARTLY SCORNED
2816-156159-0007 FOR THE COMING STRIFE OF THIS TEMPORAL WORLD I READ AND READ THE ILIAD EVEN OUTWARDLY IT WAS NOT LIKE OTHER BOOKS IT WAS THRONED IN TOWERING FOLIOS THERE WAS A PREFACE OR DISSERTATION PRINTED IN TYPE STILL MORE MAJESTIC THAN THE REST OF THE BOOK
2816-156159-0008 THAT THE ILIAD WAS ALL IN ALL TO THE HUMAN RACETHAT IT WAS HISTORY POETRY REVELATION THAT THE WORKS OF MENS HANDS WERE FOLLY AND VANITY AND WOULD PASS AWAY LIKE THE DREAMS OF A CHILD BUT THAT THE KINGDOM OF HOMER WOULD ENDURE FOR EVER AND EVER
2816-156159-0009 I ASSENTED WITH ALL MY SOUL I READ AND STILL READ I CAME TO KNOW HOMER A LEARNED COMMENTATOR KNOWS SOMETHING OF THE GREEKS IN THE SAME SENSE AS AN OIL AND COLOUR MAN MAY BE SAID TO KNOW SOMETHING OF PAINTING
2816-156159-0010 BUT TAKE AN UNTAMED CHILD AND LEAVE HIM ALONE FOR TWELVE MONTHS WITH ANY TRANSLATION OF HOMER AND HE WILL BE NEARER BY TWENTY CENTURIES TO THE SPIRIT OF OLD GREECE HE DOES NOT STOP IN THE NINTH YEAR OF THE SIEGE TO ADMIRE THIS OR THAT GROUP OF WORDS
2816-156159-0011 AND MOUNTS INTO HEAVEN FOR SAFETY THEN THE BEAUTIFUL EPISODE OF THE SIXTH BOOK THE WAY TO FEEL THIS IS NOT TO GO CASTING ABOUT AND LEARNING FROM PASTORS AND MASTERS HOW BEST TO ADMIRE IT THE IMPATIENT CHILD IS NOT GRUBBING FOR BEAUTIES
2816-156159-0012 BUT PUSHING THE SIEGE THE WOMEN VEX HIM WITH THEIR DELAYS AND THEIR TALKING THE MENTION OF THE NURSE IS PERSONAL AND LITTLE SYMPATHY HAS HE FOR THE CHILD THAT IS YOUNG ENOUGH TO BE FRIGHTENED AT THE NODDING PLUME OF A HELMET
2816-156159-0013 BUT ALL THE WHILE THAT HE THUS CHAFES AT THE PAUSING OF THE ACTION THE STRONG VERTICAL LIGHT OF HOMERS POETRY IS BLAZING SO FULL UPON THE PEOPLE AND THINGS OF THE ILIAD THAT SOON TO THE EYES OF THE CHILD THEY GROW FAMILIAR AS HIS MOTHERS SHAWL
2816-156159-0014 YET OF THIS GREAT GAIN HE IS UNCONSCIOUS AND ON HE GOES VENGEFULLY THIRSTING FOR THE BEST BLOOD OF TROY AND NEVER REMITTING HIS FIERCENESS TILL ALMOST SUDDENLY IT IS CHANGED FOR SORROWTHE NEW AND GENEROUS SORROW THAT HE LEARNS TO FEEL
2816-156159-0015 HEROIC DAYS ARE THESE BUT THE DARK AGES OF SCHOOLBOY LIFE COME CLOSING OVER THEM I SUPPOSE IT IS ALL RIGHT IN THE END YET BY JOVE AT FIRST SIGHT IT DOES SEEM A SAD INTELLECTUAL FALL FROM YOUR MOTHERS DRESSING ROOM TO A BUZZING SCHOOL
2816-156159-0016 YOU FEEL SO KEENLY THE DELIGHTS OF EARLY KNOWLEDGE YOU FORM STRANGE MYSTIC FRIENDSHIPS WITH THE MERE NAMES OF MOUNTAINS AND SEAS AND CONTINENTS AND MIGHTY RIVERS YOU LEARN THE WAYS OF THE PLANETS AND TRANSCEND THEIR NARROW LIMITS AND ASK FOR THE END OF SPACE
2816-156159-0017 YOU VEX THE ELECTRIC CYLINDER TILL IT YIELDS YOU FOR YOUR TOY TO PLAY WITH THAT SUBTLE FIRE IN WHICH OUR EARTH WAS FORGED YOU KNOW OF THE NATIONS THAT HAVE TOWERED HIGH IN THE WORLD AND THE LIVES OF THE MEN WHO HAVE SAVED WHOLE EMPIRES FROM OBLIVION
2816-156159-0018 WHAT MORE WILL YOU EVER LEARN YET THE DISMAL CHANGE IS ORDAINED AND THEN THIN MEAGRE LATIN THE SAME FOR EVERYBODY WITH SMALL SHREDS AND PATCHES OF GREEK IS THROWN LIKE A PAUPERS PALL OVER ALL YOUR EARLY LORE
2816-156159-0019 DICTIONARIES AND LEXICONS AND HORRIBLE ODDS AND ENDS OF DEAD LANGUAGES ARE GIVEN YOU FOR YOUR PORTION AND DOWN YOU FALL FROM ROMAN STORY TO A THREE INCH SCRAP OF SCRIPTORES ROMANI
2816-156159-0020 CUT UP BY COMMENTATORS AND SERVED OUT BY SCHOOLMASTERS IT WAS NOT THE RECOLLECTION OF SCHOOL NOR COLLEGE LEARNING BUT THE RAPTUROUS AND EARNEST READING OF MY CHILDHOOD WHICH MADE ME BEND FORWARD SO LONGINGLY TO THE PLAINS OF TROY
2816-156159-0021 AWAY FROM OUR PEOPLE AND OUR HORSES METHLEY AND I WENT LOITERING ALONG BY THE WILLOW BANKS OF A STREAM THAT CREPT IN QUIETNESS THROUGH THE LOW EVEN PLAIN THERE WAS NO STIR OF WEATHER OVERHEAD NO SOUND OF RURAL LABOUR
2816-156159-0022 NO SIGN OF LIFE IN THE LAND BUT ALL THE EARTH WAS DEAD AND STILL AS THOUGH IT HAD LAIN FOR THRICE A THOUSAND YEARS UNDER THE LEADEN GLOOM OF ONE UNBROKEN SABBATH
2816-156159-0023 IN SOME PLACES ITS WATERS WERE PARTED AND THEN AGAIN LOWER DOWN THEY WOULD MEET ONCE MORE I COULD SEE THAT THE STREAM FROM YEAR TO YEAR WAS FINDING ITSELF NEW CHANNELS AND FLOWED NO LONGER IN ITS ANCIENT TRACK
2816-156159-0024 BUT I KNEW THAT THE SPRINGS WHICH FED IT WERE HIGH ON IDATHE
2816-156159-0025 I TELL MYSELF NOW AS A PROFANE FACT THAT I DID STAND BY THAT RIVER METHLEY GATHERED SOME SEEDS FROM THE BUSHES THAT GREW THERE BUT SINCE THAT I AM AWAY FROM HIS BANKS
2816-156159-0026 A KIND OF INDISTINCTNESS
2816-156159-0027 ONES MIND REGAINS IN ABSENCE THAT DOMINION OVER EARTHLY THINGS WHICH HAS BEEN SHAKEN BY THEIR RUDE CONTACT YOU FORCE YOURSELF HARDILY INTO THE MATERIAL PRESENCE OF A MOUNTAIN
2816-156159-0028 OR A RIVER WHOSE NAME BELONGS TO POETRY AND ANCIENT RELIGION RATHER THAN TO THE EXTERNAL WORLD YOUR FEELINGS WOUND UP AND KEPT READY FOR SOME SORT OF HALF EXPECTED RAPTURE ARE CHILLED AND BORNE DOWN FOR THE TIME UNDER ALL THIS LOAD OF REAL EARTH AND WATER
2816-156159-0029 BUT LET THESE ONCE PASS OUT OF SIGHT AND THEN AGAIN THE OLD FANCIFUL NOTIONS ARE RESTORED AND THE MERE REALITIES WHICH YOU HAVE JUST BEEN LOOKING AT ARE THROWN BACK SO FAR INTO DISTANCE THAT THE VERY EVENT OF YOUR INTRUSION UPON SUCH SCENES
2816-156159-0030 BEGINS TO LOOK DIM AND UNCERTAIN AS THOUGH IT BELONGED TO MYTHOLOGY IT IS NOT OVER THE PLAIN BEFORE TROY THAT THE RIVER NOW FLOWS ITS WATERS HAVE EDGED AWAY FAR TOWARDS THE NORTH SINCE THE DAY THAT DIVINE SCAMANDER
2816-156159-0031 WHOM THE GODS CALL XANTHUS WENT DOWN TO DO BATTLE FOR ILION WITH MARS AND PHOEBUS AND LATONA AND DIANA GLORYING IN HER ARROWS AND VENUS THE LOVER OF SMILES
2816-156159-0032 HOW HAPPILY METHLEY REMINDED ME THAT HOMER HIMSELF HAD WARNED US OF SOME SUCH CHANGES THE GREEKS IN BEGINNING THEIR WALL HAD NEGLECTED THE HECATOMBS DUE TO THE GODS AND SO AFTER THE FALL OF TROY APOLLO TURNED THE PATHS OF THE RIVERS THAT FLOW FROM IDA
2816-156159-0033 AND SENT THEM FLOODING OVER THE WALL TILL ALL THE BEACH WAS SMOOTH AND FREE FROM THE UNHALLOWED WORKS OF THE GREEKS IT IS TRUE I SEE NOW ON LOOKING TO THE PASSAGE THAT NEPTUNE WHEN THE WORK OF DESTRUCTION WAS DONE
2816-156159-0034 TURNED BACK THE RIVERS TO THEIR ANCIENT WAYS BUT THEIR OLD CHANNELS PASSING THROUGH THAT LIGHT PERVIOUS SOIL
2816-156159-0035 AND PERHAPS THE GOD WHEN HE WILLED TO BRING BACK THE RIVERS TO THEIR ANCIENT BEDS MAY HAVE DONE HIS WORK BUT ILL IT IS EASIER THEY SAY TO DESTROY THAN IT IS TO RESTORE
2816-156159-0036 WE TOOK TO OUR HORSES AGAIN AND WENT SOUTHWARD TOWARDS THE VERY PLAIN BETWEEN TROY AND THE TENTS OF THE GREEKS BUT WE RODE BY A LINE AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE SHORE WHETHER IT WAS THAT THE LAY OF THE GROUND HINDERED MY VIEW TOWARDS THE SEA
2816-156159-0037 BUT IT WAS NOT QUITE SUDDENLY INDEED BUT RATHER AS IT WERE IN THE SWELLING AND FALLING OF A SINGLE WAVE THAT THE REALITY OF THAT VERY SEA VIEW WHICH HAD BOUNDED THE SIGHT OF THE GREEKS
2816-156159-0038 CONCEIVE HOW DEEPLY THAT ETERNAL COAST LINE THAT FIXED HORIZON THOSE ISLAND ROCKS MUST HAVE GRAVEN THEIR IMAGES UPON THE MINDS OF THE GRECIAN WARRIORS BY THE TIME THAT THEY HAD REACHED THE NINTH YEAR OF THE SIEGE
2816-156159-0039 CONCEIVE THE STRENGTH AND THE FANCIFUL BEAUTY OF THE SPEECHES WITH WHICH A WHOLE ARMY OF IMAGINING MEN MUST HAVE TOLD THEIR WEARINESS AND HOW THE SAUNTERING CHIEFS MUST HAVE WHELMED THAT DAILY DAILY SCENE WITH THEIR DEEP IONIAN CURSES
2816-156159-0040 AND NOW IT WAS THAT MY EYES WERE GREETED WITH A DELIGHTFUL SURPRISE WHILST WE WERE AT CONSTANTINOPLE METHLEY AND I HAD PORED OVER THE MAP TOGETHER WE AGREED THAT WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THE EXACT SITE OF TROY
2816-156159-0041 IN WHICH NEPTUNE IS REPRESENTED AS LOOKING AT THE SCENE OF ACTION BEFORE ILION FROM ABOVE THE ISLAND OF SAMOTHRACE NOW SAMOTHRACE ACCORDING TO THE MAP APPEARED TO BE NOT ONLY OUT OF ALL SEEING DISTANCE FROM THE TROAD
2816-156159-0042 BUT TO BE ENTIRELY SHUT OUT FROM IT BY THE INTERVENING IMBROS WHICH IS A LARGER ISLAND STRETCHING ITS LENGTH RIGHT ATHWART THE LINE OF SIGHT FROM SAMOTHRACE TO TROY PIOUSLY ALLOWING THAT THE DREAD COMMOTER OF OUR GLOBE MIGHT HAVE SEEN ALL MORTAL DOINGS
2816-156159-0043 I STILL FELT THAT IF A STATION WERE TO BE CHOSEN FROM WHICH TO SEE THE FIGHT OLD HOMER SO MATERIAL IN HIS WAYS OF THOUGHT SO AVERSE FROM ALL HAZINESS AND OVERREACHING WOULD HAVE MEANT TO GIVE THE GOD FOR HIS STATION SOME SPOT WITHIN REACH OF MENS EYES FROM THE PLAINS OF TROY
2816-156159-0044 I THINK THAT THIS TESTING OF THE POETS WORDS BY MAP AND COMPASS MAY HAVE SHAKEN A LITTLE OF MY FAITH IN THE COMPLETENESS OF HIS KNOWLEDGE WELL NOW I HAD COME THERE TO THE SOUTH WAS TENEDOS AND HERE AT MY SIDE WAS IMBROS ALL RIGHT
2816-156159-0045 AND ACCORDING TO THE MAP BUT ALOFT OVER IMBROS ALOFT IN A FAR AWAY HEAVEN WAS SAMOTHRACE THE WATCH TOWER OF NEPTUNE SO HOMER HAD APPOINTED IT AND SO IT WAS THE MAP WAS CORRECT ENOUGH BUT COULD NOT LIKE HOMER CONVEY THE WHOLE TRUTH
2816-156159-0046 THUS VAIN AND FALSE ARE THE MERE HUMAN SURMISES AND DOUBTS WHICH CLASH WITH HOMERIC WRIT NOBODY WHOSE MIND HAD NOT BEEN REDUCED TO THE MOST DEPLORABLE LOGICAL CONDITION COULD LOOK UPON THIS BEAUTIFUL CONGRUITY BETWIXT THE ILIAD AND THE MATERIAL WORLD
2816-156159-0047 AND YET BEAR TO SUPPOSE THAT THE POET MAY HAVE LEARNED THE FEATURES OF THE COAST FROM MERE HEARSAY NOW THEN I BELIEVED NOW I KNEW THAT HOMER HAD PASSED ALONG HERE THAT THIS VISION OF SAMOTHRACE OVER TOWERING THE NEARER ISLAND WAS COMMON TO HIM
2816-156159-0048 AND TO ME AFTER A JOURNEY OF SOME FEW DAYS BY THE ROUTE OF ADRAMITI AND PERGAMO WE REACHED SMYRNA
