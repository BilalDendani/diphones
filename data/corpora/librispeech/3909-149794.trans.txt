3909-149794-0000 DAY TO SEE IF ANY MENTION WAS MADE OF THE VISIT OF OZMA AND DOROTHY TO THE ENCHANTED MOUNTAIN OF THE FLATHEADS AND THE MAGIC ISLE OF THE SKEEZERS THE RECORDS TOLD HER THAT OZMA HAD ARRIVED AT THE MOUNTAIN
3909-149794-0001 THAT SHE HAD ESCAPED WITH HER COMPANION AND GONE TO THE ISLAND OF THE SKEEZERS AND THAT QUEEN COO EE OH HAD SUBMERGED THE ISLAND SO THAT IT WAS ENTIRELY UNDER WATER
3909-149794-0002 INTO A SWAN NO OTHER DETAILS WERE GIVEN IN THE GREAT BOOK AND SO GLINDA DID NOT KNOW THAT SINCE COO EE OH HAD FORGOTTEN HER MAGIC NONE OF THE SKEEZERS KNEW HOW TO RAISE THE ISLAND TO THE SURFACE AGAIN
3909-149794-0003 SO GLINDA WAS NOT WORRIED ABOUT OZMA AND DOROTHY UNTIL ONE MORNING WHILE SHE SAT WITH HER MAIDS THERE CAME A SUDDEN CLANG OF THE GREAT ALARM BELL THIS WAS SO UNUSUAL
3909-149794-0004 THAT EVERY MAID GAVE A START AND EVEN THE SORCERESS FOR A MOMENT COULD NOT THINK WHAT THE ALARM MEANT THEN SHE REMEMBERED THE RING SHE HAD GIVEN DOROTHY WHEN SHE LEFT THE PALACE TO START ON HER VENTURE
3909-149794-0005 IN GIVING THE RING GLINDA HAD WARNED THE LITTLE GIRL NOT TO USE ITS MAGIC POWERS UNLESS SHE AND OZMA WERE IN REAL DANGER BUT THEN SHE WAS TO TURN IT ON HER FINGER
3909-149794-0006 OZMA AND DOROTHY ARE PRISONERS IN THE GREAT DOME OF THE ISLE OF THE SKEEZERS
3909-149794-0007 HASN'T OZMA THE POWER TO RAISE THE ISLAND TO THE SURFACE INQUIRED GLINDA NO WAS THE REPLY AND THE RECORD REFUSED TO SAY MORE
3909-149794-0008 AFTER DILIGENT SEARCH SHE DISCOVERED THAT COO EE OH WAS A POWERFUL SORCERESS WHO HAD GAINED MOST OF HER POWER BY TREACHEROUSLY TRANSFORMING THE ADEPTS OF MAGIC
3909-149794-0009 WHO WERE VISITING HER INTO THREE FISHES GOLD SILVER AND BRONZE AFTER WHICH SHE HAD THEM CAST INTO THE LAKE GLINDA REFLECTED
3909-149794-0010 EARNESTLY ON THIS INFORMATION AND DECIDED THAT SOMEONE MUST GO TO OZMA'S ASSISTANCE WHILE THERE WAS NO GREAT NEED OF HASTE BECAUSE OZMA AND DOROTHY COULD LIVE IN A SUBMERGED DOME A LONG TIME
3909-149794-0011 IT WAS EVIDENT THEY COULD NOT GET OUT UNTIL SOMEONE WAS ABLE TO RAISE THE ISLAND THE SORCERESS LOOKED THROUGH ALL HER RECIPES AND BOOKS OF SORCERY
3909-149794-0012 BUT COULD FIND NO MAGIC THAT WOULD RAISE A SUNKEN ISLAND SUCH A THING HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN REQUIRED IN SORCERY THEN GLINDA MADE A LITTLE ISLAND COVERED BY A GLASS DOME
3909-149794-0013 AND SUNK IT IN A POND NEAR HER CASTLE AND EXPERIMENTED IN MAGICAL WAYS TO BRING IT TO THE SURFACE SHE MADE SEVERAL SUCH EXPERIMENTS BUT ALL WERE FAILURES
3909-149794-0014 IT SEEMED A SIMPLE THING TO DO YET SHE COULD NOT DO IT NEVERTHELESS THE WISE SORCERESS DID NOT DESPAIR OF FINDING A WAY TO LIBERATE HER FRIENDS FINALLY SHE CONCLUDED THAT THE
3909-149794-0015 BEST THING TO DO WAS TO GO TO THE SKEEZER COUNTRY AND EXAMINE THE LAKE WHILE THERE SHE WAS MORE LIKELY TO DISCOVER A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM THAT BOTHERED HER AND TO WORK OUT A PLAN
3909-149794-0016 TO THE EMERALD CITY IN PRINCESS OZMA'S PALACE THE SCARECROW WAS NOW ACTING AS RULER OF THE LAND OF OZ THERE WASN'T MUCH FOR HIM TO DO
3909-149794-0017 UNDER OZMA'S PROTECTION AND WERE GREAT FRIENDS OF DOROTHY AND MUCH LOVED BY ALL THE OZ PEOPLE SOMETHING'S HAPPENED CRIED TROT
3909-149794-0018 AS THE CHARIOT OF THE SORCERESS DESCENDED NEAR THEM GLINDA NEVER COMES HERE CEPT SOMETHING'S GONE WRONG I HOPE NO HARM HAS COME TO OZMA OR DOROTHY
3909-149794-0019 SAID BETSY ANXIOUSLY AS THE LOVELY SORCERESS STEPPED DOWN FROM HER CHARIOT GLINDA APPROACHED THE SCARECROW AND TOLD HIM OF THE DILEMMA OF OZMA AND DOROTHY AND SHE ADDED
3909-149794-0020 WE MUST SAVE THEM SOMEHOW SCARECROW OF COURSE REPLIED THE SCARECROW STUMBLING OVER A WICKET AND FALLING FLAT ON HIS PAINTED FACE
3909-149794-0021 THE GIRLS PICKED HIM UP AND PATTED HIS STRAW STUFFING INTO SHAPE AND HE CONTINUED AS IF NOTHING HAD OCCURRED BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO
3909-149794-0022 IN ALL MY LIFE WE MUST HAVE A COUNCIL OF STATE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE PROPOSED THE SORCERESS PLEASE SEND MESSENGERS TO SUMMON ALL OF OZMA'S COUNSELLORS TO THIS PALACE
3909-149794-0023 THEN WE CAN DECIDE WHAT IS BEST TO BE DONE THE SCARECROW LOST NO TIME IN DOING THIS
