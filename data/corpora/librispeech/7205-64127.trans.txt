7205-64127-0000 THE STURDY DAMES AND ROBUST DAMSELS NOW RAMBLING OVER ITS GROUNDS AND GRAVELLED WALKS ARE THE DWELLERS IN ROADSIDE COTTAGES WHO AT THE WORDS MURDERED OR MISSING DROP BROOMS UPON HALF SWEPT FLOORS LEAVE BABIES UNCARED FOR IN THEIR CRADLES AND ARE OFF TO THE INDICATED SPOT
7205-64127-0001 AND SUCH WORDS HAVE GONE ABROAD FROM LLANGORREN COURT COUPLED WITH THE NAME OF ITS YOUNG MISTRESS GWEN WYNN IS MISSING IF SHE BE NOT ALSO MURDERED IT IS THE SECOND DAY AFTER HER DISAPPEARANCE AS KNOWN TO THE HOUSEHOLD
7205-64127-0002 AND NOW IT IS KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD NEAR AND FAR THE SLIGHT SCANDAL DREADED BY MISS LINTON NO LONGER HAS INFLUENCE WITH HER THE CONTINUED ABSENCE OF HER NIECE WITH THE CERTAINTY AT LENGTH REACHED THAT SHE IS NOT IN THE HOUSE OF ANY NEIGHBOURING FRIEND
7205-64127-0003 WOULD MAKE CONCEALMENT OF THE MATTER A GRAVE SCANDAL IN ITSELF BESIDES SINCE THE HALF HEARTED SEARCH OF YESTERDAY NEW FACTS HAVE COME TO LIGHT FOR ONE THE FINDING OF THAT RING ON THE FLOOR OF THE PAVILION
7205-64127-0004 IT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED NOT ONLY BY THE FINDER BUT BY ELEANOR LEES AND MISS LINTON HERSELF A RARE CLUSTER OF BRILLIANTS BESIDES OF VALUE IT HAS MORE THAN ONCE RECEIVED THE INSPECTION OF THESE LADIES
7205-64127-0005 BOTH KNOWING THE GIVER AS THE NATURE OF THE GIFT HOW COMES IT TO HAVE BEEN THERE IN THE SUMMER HOUSE DROPPED OF COURSE BUT UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES QUESTIONS PERPLEXING WHILE THE THING ITSELF SERIOUSLY HEIGHTENS THE ALARM
7205-64127-0006 NO ONE HOWEVER RICH OR REGARDLESS WOULD FLING SUCH PRECIOUS STONES AWAY ABOVE ALL GEMS SO BESTOWED AND AS MISS LEES HAS REASON TO KNOW PRIZED AND FONDLY TREASURED
7205-64127-0007 FAST BECOMING BELIEF THAT MISS WYNN WENT NOT AWAY OF HER OWN ACCORD INSTEAD HAS BEEN TAKEN ROBBED TOO BEFORE BEING EARNED OFF THERE WERE OTHER RINGS UPON HER FINGERS DIAMONDS EMERALDS AND THE LIKE
7205-64127-0008 POSSIBLY IN THE SCRAMBLE ON THE ROBBERS FIRST SEIZING HOLD AND HASTILY STRIPPING HER THIS PARTICULAR ONE HAD SLIPPED THROUGH THEIR FINGERS FALLEN TO THE FLOOR AND SO ESCAPED OBSERVATION AT NIGHT AND IN THE DARKNESS ALL LIKELY ENOUGH
7205-64127-0009 SO FOR A TIME RUN THE SURMISES DESPITE THE HORRIBLE SUGGESTION ATTACHING TO THEM ALMOST AS A CONSEQUENCE FOR IF GWEN WYNN HAD BEEN ROBBED SHE MAY ALSO BE MURDERED THE COSTLY JEWELS SHE WORE IN RINGS BRACELETS AND CHAINS WORTH MANY HUNDREDS OF POUNDS
7205-64127-0010 MAY HAVE BEEN THE TEMPTATION TO PLUNDER HER BUT THE PLUNDERERS IDENTIFIED AND FEARING PUNISHMENT WOULD ALSO MAKE AWAY WITH HER PERSON IT MAY BE ABDUCTION BUT IT HAS NOW MORE THE LOOK OF MURDER BY MIDDAY THE ALARM HAS REACHED ITS HEIGHT
7205-64127-0011 THE HUE AND CRY IS AT ITS LOUDEST NO LONGER CONFINED TO THE FAMILY AND DOMESTICS NO MORE THE RELATIVES AND INTIMATE FRIENDS PEOPLE OF ALL CLASSES AND KINDS TAKE PART IN IT THE PLEASURE GROUNDS OF LLANGORREN
7205-64127-0012 ARE NOW TRAMPLED BY HEAVY HOBNAILED SHOES WHILE MEN IN SMOCKS SLOPS AND SHEEPSKIN GAITERS STRIDE EXCITEDLY TO AND FRO OR STAND IN GROUPS ALL WEARING THE SAME EXPRESSION ON THEIR FEATURES THAT OF A SINCERE HONEST ANXIETY
7205-64127-0013 WITH A FEAR SOME SINISTER MISCHANCE HAS OVERTAKEN MISS WYNN MANY A YOUNG FARMER IS THERE WHO HAS RIDDEN BESIDE HER IN THE HUNTING FIELD OFTEN BEHIND HER NO WAYS NETTLED BY HER GIVING HIM THE LEAD INSTEAD ADMIRING HER COURAGE AND STYLE OF TAKING FENCES OVER WHICH
7205-64127-0014 ON HIS CART NAG HE DARES NOT FOLLOW ENTHUSIASTICALLY PROCLAIMING HER PLUCK AT MARKETS RACE MEETINGS AND OTHER GATHERINGS WHEREVER CAME UP TALK OF TALLY HO
7205-64127-0015 STILL OTHERS ARE THERE IN THE EXERCISE OF OFFICIAL DUTY SEVERAL MAGISTRATES HAVE ARRIVED AT LLANGORREN AMONG THEM SIR GEORGE SHENSTONE CHAIRMAN OF THE DISTRICT BENCH THE POLICE SUPERINTENDENT ALSO WITH SEVERAL OF HIS BLUE COATED SUBORDINATES
7205-64127-0016 THERE IS A MAN PRESENT ABOUT WHOM REMARK IS MADE AND WHO ATTRACTS MORE ATTENTION THAN EITHER JUSTICE OF THE PEACE OR POLICEMAN IT IS A CIRCUMSTANCE UNPRECEDENTED A STRANGE SIGHT INDEED LEWIN MURDOCK AT THE COURT
7205-64127-0017 HE IS THERE NEVERTHELESS TAKING AN ACTIVE PART IN THE PROCEEDINGS IT SEEMS NATURAL ENOUGH TO THOSE WHO BUT KNOW HIM TO BE THE COUSIN OF THE MISSING LADY
7205-64127-0018 BUT TO THESE ON REFLECTION HIS BEHAVIOUR IS QUITE COMPREHENSIBLE THEY CONSTRUE IT DIFFERENTLY FROM THE OTHERS THE OUTSIDE SPECTATORS MORE THAN ONE OF THEM OBSERVING THE ANXIOUS EXPRESSION UPON HIS FACE
7205-64127-0019 BELIEVE IT BUT A SEMBLANCE A MASK TO HIDE THE SATISFACTION WITHIN HIS HEART TO BECOME JOY IF GWEN WYNN BE FOUND DEAD IT IS NOT A THING TO BE SPOKEN OF OPENLY AND NO ONE SO SPEAKS OF IT
7205-64127-0020 THE CONSTRUCTION PUT UPON LEWIN MURDOCK'S MOTIVES IS CONFINED TO THE FEW FOR ONLY A FEW KNOW HOW MUCH HE IS INTERESTED IN THE UPSHOT OF THAT SEARCH AGAIN IT IS SET ON FOOT BUT NOT AS ON THE DAY PRECEDING
7205-64127-0021 NOW NO MAD RUSHING TO AND FRO OF MERE PHYSICAL DEMONSTRATION THIS DAY THERE IS DUE DELIBERATION A COUNCIL HELD COMPOSED OF THE MAGISTRATES AND OTHER GENTLEMEN OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AIDED BY A LAWYER OR TWO AND THE TALENTS OF AN EXPERIENCED DETECTIVE
7205-64127-0022 THE FIELDS TRAVERSED THE WOODS AS WELL WHILE PARTIES PROCEED UP AND DOWN THE RIVER AND ALONG BOTH SIDES OF THE BACKWASH
7205-64127-0023 AS YET THE DRAG HAS NOT BEEN CALLED INTO REQUISITION THE DEEP FLOOD WITH A SWIFT STRONG CURRENT PREVENTING IT
7205-64127-0024 THAT GWENDOLINE WYNN IS DEAD AND HER BODY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WYE
7205-64127-0025 EQUALLY INCREDIBLE THAT SHE HAS DROWNED HERSELF
7205-64127-0026 A THIRD SUPPOSITION THAT SHE HAS BEEN THE VICTIM OF REVENGE OF A JEALOUS LOVER'S SPITE SEEMS ALIKE UNTENABLE
7205-64127-0027 THE THING IS PREPOSTEROUS AND YET THIS VERY THING BEGINS TO RECEIVE CREDENCE IN THE MINDS OF MANY OF MORE AS NEW FACTS ARE DEVELOPED BY THE MAGISTERIAL ENQUIRY CARRIED ON INSIDE THE HOUSE
7205-64127-0028 THERE A STRANGE CHAPTER OF EVIDENCE COMES OUT OR RATHER IS ELICITED MISS LINTON'S MAID CLARISSE IS THE AUTHOR OF IT
7205-64127-0029 AND LINGERING THERE TILL AFTER THE LATEST GUEST HAD TAKEN DEPARTURE HEARD HIGH VOICES SPEAKING AS IN ANGER
7205-64127-0030 AND LE CAPITAINE BY THE LATTER MEANING CAPTAIN RYECROFT STARTLING TESTIMONY THIS WHEN TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE STRAYED RING COLLATERAL TO THE UGLY SUSPICION THE LATTER HAD ALREADY CONJURED UP NOR IS THE FEMME DE CHAMBRE TELLING ANY UNTRUTH
7205-64127-0031 SHE HAD GONE DOWN TO THE BOAT DOCK IN THE HOPE OF HAVING A WORD WITH THE HANDSOME WATERMAN AND RETURNED FROM IT RELUCTANTLY FINDING HE HAD BETAKEN HIMSELF TO HIS BOAT SHE DOES NOT THUS STATE HER REASON FOR SO BEING ABROAD BUT GIVES A DIFFERENT ONE
7205-64127-0032 THE LAMPS AND TRANSPARENCIES STILL UNEXTINGUISHED ALL NATURAL ENOUGH AND QUESTIONED AS TO WHY SHE SAID NOTHING OF IT ON THE DAY BEFORE HER ANSWER IS EQUALLY EVASIVE PARTLY THAT SHE DID NOT SUPPOSE THE THING WORTH SPEAKING OF
7205-64127-0033 AND PARTLY BECAUSE SHE DID NOT LIKE TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT MADEMOISELLE HAD BEEN BEHAVING IN THAT WAY QUARRELLING WITH A GENTLEMAN IN THE FLOOD OF LIGHT JUST LET IN NO ONE ANY LONGER THINKS THAT MISS WYNN HAS BEEN ROBBED THOUGH IT MAY BE THAT SHE HAS SUFFERED SOMETHING WORSE
7205-64127-0034 WHAT FOR COULD HAVE BEEN THE ANGRY WORDS AND THE QUARREL HOW DID IT END AND NOW THE NAME RYECROFT IS ON EVERY TONGUE NO LONGER IN CAUTIOUS WHISPERINGS BUT LOUDLY PRONOUNCED
