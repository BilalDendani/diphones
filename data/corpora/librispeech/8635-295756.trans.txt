8635-295756-0014 THE FLEAS AND BUGS SOON FORCED GEORGE TO GET UP AND PUT ON HIS CLOTHES AND LIE AS THE REST OF THE MEN DID AND HAD WE NOT BEEN SO TIRED HE SAYS I AM SURE WE SHOULD NOT HAVE SLEPT MUCH THAT NIGHT HE MADE A VOW THEN

8635-295756-0016 HAD NOT BEEN SO HIGH BY SIX FEET AS IT WAS AT THAT TIME THEY MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO STAY THERE FOR A DAY OR TWO WENT TO SEE THE WARM SPRINGS
8635-295756-0017 THE MEN CROSSED IN BIRCH BARK BOATS AND RODE ALL THE NEXT DAY IN A RAIN STORM TO A PLACE TWO SCORE MILES FROM WHERE THEY HAD SET OUT THAT MORN WASH ING TON WRITES THAT THE ROAD WAS
8635-295756-0018 THE WORST THAT HAD EVER BEEN TROD BY MAN OR BEAST ON MARCH TWENTY THIRD THEY FELL IN WITH A SCORE OR TWO OF RED MEN WHO HAD BEEN OFF TO WAR AND BROUGHT HOME BUT ONE SCALP AND THEY HAD A CHANCE TO SEE A WAR DANCE
8635-295756-0019 THE RED MEN CLEARED A LARGE SPACE AND BUILT A FIRE IN THE MIDST OF IT ROUND WHICH THEY ALL SAT ONE OF THE MEN THEN MADE A GRAND SPEECH IN WHICH HE TOLD THEM HOW THEY WERE TO DANCE WHEN HE HAD DONE THE ONE WHO COULD DANCE THE BEST SPRANG UP
8635-295756-0020 AS IF HE HAD JUST BEEN ROUSED FROM SLEEP AND RAN AND JUMPED ROUND THE RING IN A QUEER KIND OF WAY THE REST SOON JOINED HIM AND DID JUST AS HE DID BY THIS TIME THE BAND MADE IT SELF HEARD
8635-295756-0021 AND I SHALL HAVE TO TELL YOU WHAT A FINE BAND IT WAS THERE WAS A POT HALF FULL OF WATER WITH A PIECE OF DEER SKIN STRETCHED TIGHT ON THE TOP AND A GOURD WITH SOME SHOT IN IT AND A PIECE OF HORSE'S TAIL TIED TO IT TO MAKE IT LOOK FINE
8635-295756-0022 LATE IN THE DAY OF MARCH TWENTY SIXTH THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE DWELT A MAN NAMED HEDGE WHO WAS IN THE PAY OF KING GEORGE AS JUSTICE OF THE PEACE HERE THEY CAMPED AND AT THE MEAL THAT WAS SPREAD THERE WAS NOT A KNIFE
8635-295756-0023 NOR A FORK TO EAT WITH BUT SUCH AS THE GUESTS HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM ON THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST OF A PRIL THE WIND BLEW AND THE RAIN FELL THE STRAW ON WHICH THEY LAY TOOK FIRE AND GEORGE WAS SAVED BY ONE OF THE MEN WHO WOKE HIM WHEN IT WAS IN A BLAZE
8635-295756-0024 I HAVE NOT SLEPT FOR FOUR NIGHTS IN A BED WROTE WASH ING TON AT THIS TIME TO ONE OF HIS YOUNG FRIENDS AT HOME BUT WHEN I HAVE WALKED A GOOD DEAL IN THE DAY I LIE DOWN ON A HEAP OF STRAW
