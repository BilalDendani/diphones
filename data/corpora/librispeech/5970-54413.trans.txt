5970-54413-0000 A FAREWELL DINNER MAURICE OAKLEY WAS NOT A MAN OF SUDDEN OR VIOLENT ENTHUSIASMS CONSERVATISM WAS THE QUALITY THAT HAD BEEN THE FOUNDATION OF HIS FORTUNES
5970-54413-0001 AT A TIME WHEN THE DISRUPTION OF THE COUNTRY HAD INVOLVED MOST OF THE MEN OF HIS REGION IN RUIN WITHOUT GIVING ANY ONE GROUND TO CHARGE HIM WITH
5970-54413-0002 BEING LUKEWARM OR RENEGADE TO HIS CAUSE HE HAD YET SO ADROITLY MANAGED HIS AFFAIRS
5970-54413-0003 WITH A RARE GENIUS FOR ADAPTING HIMSELF TO NEW CONDITIONS HE ACCEPTED THE CHANGED ORDER OF THINGS WITH A PASSIVE RESIGNATION BUT WITH A STERN DETERMINATION TO MAKE THE MOST OUT OF ANY GOOD
5970-54413-0004 THAT MIGHT BE IN IT IT WAS A FAVOURITE REMARK OF HIS THAT THERE MUST BE SOME GOOD IN EVERY SYSTEM AND IT WAS THE DUTY OF THE CITIZEN TO FIND OUT THAT GOOD AND MAKE IT PAY
5970-54413-0005 HE HAD DONE THIS HIS HOUSE HIS REPUTATION HIS SATISFACTION WERE ALL EVIDENCES THAT HE HAD SUCCEEDED A CHILDLESS MAN
5970-54413-0006 HE BESTOWED UPON HIS YOUNGER BROTHER FRANCIS THE ENTHUSIASM HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN TO A SON HIS WIFE SHARED WITH HER HUSBAND THIS FEELING FOR HER BROTHER IN LAW AND WITH HIM PLAYED
5970-54413-0007 THE ROLE OF PARENT WHICH HAD OTHERWISE BEEN DENIED HER IT WAS TRUE THAT FRANCIS OAKLEY WAS ONLY A HALF BROTHER TO MAURICE THE SON OF A SECOND
5970-54413-0008 AND NOT TOO FORTUNATE MARRIAGE BUT THERE WAS NO HALVING OF THE LOVE WHICH THE ELDER MAN HAD GIVEN TO HIM FROM CHILDHOOD UP AT THE FIRST INTIMATION THAT FRANCIS HAD ARTISTIC ABILITY
5970-54413-0009 HIS BROTHER HAD PLACED HIM UNDER THE BEST MASTERS IN AMERICA AND LATER WHEN THE PROMISE OF HIS YOUTH HAD BEGUN TO BLOSSOM HE SENT HIM TO PARIS ALTHOUGH THE EXPENDITURE JUST AT THAT TIME
5970-54413-0010 DEMANDED A SACRIFICE WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE RUIN OF MAURICE'S OWN CAREER FRANCIS'S PROMISE HAD NEVER COME TO ENTIRE FULFILMENT HE WAS ALWAYS TREMBLING ON THE VERGE OF
5970-54413-0011 A GREAT SUCCESS WITHOUT QUITE PLUNGING INTO IT DESPITE THE JOY WHICH HIS PRESENCE GAVE HIS BROTHER AND SISTER IN LAW MOST OF HIS TIME WAS SPENT ABROAD WHERE HE COULD
5970-54413-0012 FIND JUST THE ATMOSPHERE THAT SUITED HIS DELICATE ARTISTIC NATURE AFTER A VISIT OF TWO MONTHS HE WAS ABOUT RETURNING TO PARIS FOR A STAY OF FIVE YEARS
5970-54413-0013 AT LAST HE WAS GOING TO APPLY HIMSELF STEADILY AND TRY TO BE LESS THE DILETTANTE THE COMPANY WHICH MAURICE OAKLEY
5970-54413-0014 BROUGHT TOGETHER TO SAY GOOD BYE TO HIS BROTHER ON THIS OCCASION WAS DRAWN FROM THE BEST THAT THIS FINE OLD SOUTHERN TOWN AFFORDED THERE WERE COLONELS THERE AT WHOSE TITLES AND THE OWNERS RIGHTS TO THEM NO ONE COULD LAUGH
5970-54413-0015 THERE WERE BRILLIANT WOMEN THERE WHO HAD QUEENED IT IN RICHMOND BALTIMORE LOUISVILLE AND NEW ORLEANS AND EVERY SOUTHERN CAPITAL UNDER THE OLD REGIME AND THERE WERE YOUNGER ONES THERE OF WIT
5970-54413-0016 AND BEAUTY WHO WERE JUST BEGINNING TO HOLD THEIR COURT FOR FRANCIS WAS A GREAT FAVOURITE BOTH WITH MEN AND WOMEN HE WAS A HANDSOME MAN TALL SLENDER AND GRACEFUL
5970-54413-0017 HE HAD THE FACE AND BROW OF A POET A PALLID FACE FRAMED IN A MASS OF DARK HAIR THERE WAS A TOUCH OF WEAKNESS IN HIS MOUTH BUT THIS WAS SHADED
5970-54413-0018 AND HALF HIDDEN BY A FULL MUSTACHE THAT MADE MUCH FORGIVABLE TO BEAUTY LOVING EYES IT WAS GENERALLY CONCEDED
5970-54413-0019 THAT MISSUS OAKLEY WAS A HOSTESS WHOSE GUESTS HAD NO AWKWARD HALF HOUR BEFORE DINNER NO PRAISE COULD BE HIGHER THAN THIS
5970-54413-0020 AND TO NIGHT SHE HAD NO NEED TO EXERT HERSELF TO MAINTAIN THIS REPUTATION HER BROTHER IN LAW WAS THE LIFE OF THE ASSEMBLY HE HAD WIT AND DARING AND ABOUT HIM THERE WAS
5970-54413-0021 JUST THAT HINT OF CHARMING DANGER THAT MADE HIM IRRESISTIBLE TO WOMEN THE GUESTS HEARD THE DINNER ANNOUNCED WITH SURPRISE AN UNUSUAL THING EXCEPT IN THIS HOUSE
5970-54413-0022 BOTH MAURICE OAKLEY AND HIS WIFE LOOKED FONDLY AT THE ARTIST AS HE WENT IN WITH CLAIRE LESSING HE WAS TALKING ANIMATEDLY TO THE GIRL
5970-54413-0023 HAVING CHANGED THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION TO A MANNER AND TONE DIRECTED MORE PARTICULARLY TO HER WHILE SHE LISTENED TO HIM HER FACE GLOWED
5970-54413-0024 AND HER EYES SHONE WITH A LIGHT THAT EVERY MAN COULD NOT BRING INTO THEM AS MAURICE AND HIS WIFE FOLLOWED HIM WITH THEIR GAZE THE SAME THOUGHT WAS IN THEIR MINDS AND IT HAD NOT JUST COME TO THEM
5970-54413-0025 WHY COULD NOT FRANCIS MARRY CLAIRE LESSING AND SETTLE IN AMERICA INSTEAD OF GOING BACK EVER AND AGAIN TO THAT LIFE IN THE LATIN QUARTER THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THAT IT WAS A BAD LIFE OR A DISSIPATED ONE
5970-54413-0026 BUT FROM THE LITTLE THAT THEY HAD SEEN OF IT WHEN THEY WERE IN PARIS IT WAS AT LEAST A BIT TOO FREE AND UNCONVENTIONAL FOR THEIR TRADITIONS THERE WERE TOO TEMPTATIONS WHICH MUST ASSAIL ANY MAN
5970-54413-0027 OF FRANCIS'S LOOKS AND TALENTS THEY HAD PERFECT FAITH IN THE STRENGTH OF HIS MANHOOD OF COURSE BUT COULD THEY HAVE HAD THEIR WAY
5970-54413-0028 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THEIR WILL TO HEDGE HIM ABOUT SO THAT NO BREATH OF EVIL INVITATION COULD HAVE COME NIGH TO HIM BUT THIS YOUNGER BROTHER THIS HALF WARD OF THEIRS WAS AN UNRULY MEMBER
5970-54413-0029 HE TALKED AND LAUGHED RODE AND WALKED WITH CLAIRE LESSING WITH THE SAME FREE ABANDON THE SAME SHOW OF UNINTERESTED GOOD COMRADESHIP THAT
5970-54413-0030 WHEN THEY WERE BOY AND GIRL TOGETHER THERE WAS NOT A SHADE MORE OF WARMTH OR SELF CONSCIOUSNESS IN HIS MANNER TOWARDS HER THAN THERE HAD BEEN FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE IN FACT THERE WAS LESS
5970-54413-0031 FOR THERE HAD BEEN A TIME WHEN HE WAS SIX AND CLAIRE THREE THAT FRANCIS WITH A BOLDNESS THAT THE LOVER OF MATURER YEARS TRIES VAINLY TO ATTAIN HAD ANNOUNCED TO CLAIRE THAT
5970-54413-0032 HE WAS GOING TO MARRY HER BUT HE HAD NEVER RENEWED THIS DECLARATION WHEN IT CAME TIME THAT IT WOULD CARRY WEIGHT WITH IT THEY MADE A FINE PICTURE AS THEY SAT TOGETHER TO NIGHT
5970-54413-0033 ONE SEEING THEM COULD HARDLY HELP THINKING ON THE INSTANT THAT THEY WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER SOMETHING IN THE WOMAN'S FACE IN HER EXPRESSION PERHAPS SUPPLIED
5970-54413-0034 A PALPABLE LACK IN THE MAN THE STRENGTH OF HER MOUTH AND CHIN HELPED THE WEAKNESS OF HIS SHE WAS THE SORT OF WOMAN WHO IF EVER HE CAME TO A GREAT MORAL CRISIS IN HIS LIFE
5970-54413-0035 WOULD BE ABLE TO SAVE HIM IF SHE WERE NEAR AND YET HE WAS GOING AWAY FROM HER GIVING UP THE PEARL THAT HE HAD ONLY TO PUT OUT HIS HAND TO TAKE
5970-54413-0036 SOME OF THESE THOUGHTS WERE IN THE MINDS OF THE BROTHER AND SISTER NOW FIVE YEARS DOES SEEM A LONG WHILE FRANCIS WAS SAYING
5970-54413-0037 BUT IF A MAN ACCOMPLISHES ANYTHING AFTER ALL IT SEEMS ONLY A SHORT TIME TO LOOK BACK UPON ALL TIME IS SHORT TO LOOK BACK UPON
5970-54413-0038 IT IS THE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT THAT COUNTS IT DOES N'T THOUGH WITH A MAN I SUPPOSE HE'S DOING SOMETHING ALL THE WHILE YES A MAN IS ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING
5970-54413-0039 EVEN IF ONLY WAITING BUT WAITING IS SUCH UNHEROIC BUSINESS THAT IS THE PART THAT USUALLY FALLS TO A WOMAN'S LOT
5970-54413-0040 I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SOME DARK EYED MADEMOISELLE IS WAITING FOR YOU NOW FRANCIS LAUGHED AND FLUSHED HOTLY CLAIRE NOTED THE FLUSH AND WONDERED AT IT
5970-54413-0041 HAD SHE INDEED HIT UPON THE REAL POINT WAS THAT THE REASON THAT HE WAS SO ANXIOUS TO GET BACK TO PARIS THE THOUGHT STRUCK A CHILL THROUGH HER GAIETY SHE DID NOT WANT TO BE SUSPICIOUS
5970-54413-0042 BUT WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THAT TELL TALE FLUSH HE WAS NOT A MAN EASILY DISCONCERTED THEN WHY SO TO NIGHT BUT HER COMPANION TALKED ON WITH SUCH INNOCENT COMPOSURE
5970-54413-0043 THAT SHE BELIEVED HERSELF MISTAKEN AS TO THE REASON FOR HIS MOMENTARY CONFUSION SOMEONE CRIED GAYLY ACROSS THE TABLE TO HER OH MISS CLAIRE
5970-54413-0044 YOU WILL NOT DARE TO TALK WITH SUCH LITTLE AWE TO OUR FRIEND WHEN HE COMES BACK WITH HIS RIBBONS AND HIS MEDALS WHY WE SHALL ALL HAVE TO BOW TO YOU FRANK
5970-54413-0045 THE FLOWER OF APPROVAL FROM THE FAIR WOMEN OF MY OWN STATE HEAR CRIED THE LADIES TRUST ARTISTS AND POETS TO PAY PRETTY COMPLIMENTS AND THIS WILY FRIEND OF MINE
5970-54413-0046 PAYS HIS AT MY EXPENSE A GOOD BIT OF GENERALSHIP THAT FRANK AN OLD MILITARY MAN BROKE IN ESTERTON OPENED THE BREACH AND YOU AT ONCE GALLOPED IN THAT S THE HIGHEST ART OF WAR
5970-54413-0047 CLAIRE WAS LOOKING AT HER COMPANION HAD HE MEANT THE APPROVAL OF THE WOMEN OR WAS IT ONE WOMAN THAT HE CARED FOR HAD THE SPEECH HAD A HIDDEN MEANING FOR HER
5970-54413-0048 SHE COULD NEVER TELL SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MAN WHO HAD BEEN SO MUCH TO HER FOR SO LONG AND YET DID NOT SEEM TO KNOW IT
5970-54413-0049 THE MEN LINGERED OVER THEIR CIGARS THE WINE WAS OLD AND THE STORIES NEW WHAT MORE COULD THEY ASK THERE WAS A STRONG GLOW IN FRANCIS OAKLEY'S FACE
5970-54413-0050 AND HIS LAUGH WAS FREQUENT AND RINGING SOME DISCUSSION CAME UP WHICH SENT HIM RUNNING UP TO HIS ROOM FOR A BIT OF EVIDENCE WHEN HE CAME DOWN IT WAS NOT TO COME DIRECTLY TO THE DINING ROOM
5970-54413-0051 HE PAUSED IN THE HALL AND DESPATCHED A SERVANT TO BRING HIS BROTHER TO HIM MAURICE FOUND HIM STANDING WEAKLY AGAINST THE RAILING OF THE STAIRS SOMETHING IN HIS AIR IMPRESSED HIS BROTHER STRANGELY
5970-54413-0052 WHAT IS IT FRANCIS HE QUESTIONED HURRYING TO HIM I HAVE JUST DISCOVERED A CONSIDERABLE LOSS
5970-54413-0053 IS GONE FROM MY BUREAU WHAT WHEN DID IT DISAPPEAR I WENT TO MY BUREAU TO NIGHT FOR SOMETHING AND FOUND THE MONEY GONE THEN I REMEMBERED THAT
5970-54413-0054 WHEN I OPENED IT TWO DAYS AGO I MUST HAVE LEFT THE KEY IN THE LOCK AS I FOUND IT TO NIGHT
5970-54413-0055 BUT DON'T LET S TALK OF IT NOW COME
5970-54413-0056 DON'T LOOK SO CUT UP ABOUT IT FRANK OLD MAN
5970-54413-0057 AND RE ENTERED THE ROOM WITH HIS BROTHER IN A FEW MINUTES HIS GAIETY HAD APPARENTLY RETURNED WHEN THEY REJOINED THE LADIES EVEN THEIR QUICK EYES COULD DETECT IN HIS DEMEANOUR
5970-54413-0058 NO TRACE OF THE ANNOYING THING THAT HAD OCCURRED HIS FACE DID NOT CHANGE UNTIL WITH A WEALTH OF FERVENT CONGRATULATIONS HE HAD BADE THE LAST GUEST GOOD BYE
5970-54413-0059 WHEN LESLIE IS IN BED COME INTO THE LIBRARY I WILL WAIT FOR YOU THERE HE SAID AND WALKED SADLY AWAY POOR FOOLISH FRANK MUSED HIS BROTHER
