253-124400-0000 PREFATORY NOTE BY THE AUTHOR IF THIS DISCOURSE APPEAR TOO LONG TO BE READ AT ONCE IT MAY BE DIVIDED INTO SIX PARTS
253-124400-0001 AND IN THE FIRST WILL BE FOUND VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS TOUCHING THE SCIENCES IN THE SECOND THE PRINCIPAL RULES OF THE METHOD WHICH THE AUTHOR HAS DISCOVERED IN THE THIRD CERTAIN OF THE RULES OF MORALS WHICH HE HAS DEDUCED FROM THIS METHOD IN THE FOURTH
253-124400-0002 WHICH ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF HIS METAPHYSIC IN THE FIFTH THE ORDER OF THE PHYSICAL QUESTIONS WHICH HE HAS INVESTIGATED AND IN PARTICULAR THE EXPLICATION OF THE MOTION OF THE HEART AND OF SOME OTHER DIFFICULTIES PERTAINING TO MEDICINE
253-124400-0003 AS ALSO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SOUL OF MAN AND THAT OF THE BRUTES AND IN THE LAST WHAT THE AUTHOR BELIEVES TO BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO GREATER ADVANCEMENT IN THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE THAN HAS YET BEEN MADE WITH THE REASONS THAT HAVE INDUCED HIM TO WRITE
253-124400-0004 GOOD SENSE IS OF ALL THINGS AMONG MEN THE MOST EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED FOR EVERY ONE THINKS HIMSELF SO ABUNDANTLY PROVIDED WITH IT
253-124400-0005 THAN THEY ALREADY POSSESS AND IN THIS IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT ALL ARE MISTAKEN THE CONVICTION IS RATHER TO BE HELD AS TESTIFYING THAT THE POWER OF JUDGING ARIGHT AND OF DISTINGUISHING TRUTH FROM ERROR
253-124400-0006 WHICH IS PROPERLY WHAT IS CALLED GOOD SENSE OR REASON IS BY NATURE EQUAL IN ALL MEN
253-124400-0007 DOES NOT ARISE FROM SOME BEING ENDOWED WITH A LARGER SHARE OF REASON THAN OTHERS BUT SOLELY FROM THIS THAT WE CONDUCT OUR THOUGHTS ALONG DIFFERENT WAYS AND DO NOT FIX OUR ATTENTION ON THE SAME OBJECTS
253-124400-0008 FOR TO BE POSSESSED OF A VIGOROUS MIND IS NOT ENOUGH THE PRIME REQUISITE IS RIGHTLY TO APPLY IT THE GREATEST MINDS AS THEY ARE CAPABLE OF THE HIGHEST EXCELLENCES ARE OPEN LIKEWISE TO THE GREATEST ABERRATIONS
253-124400-0009 AND THOSE WHO TRAVEL VERY SLOWLY MAY YET MAKE FAR GREATER PROGRESS PROVIDED THEY KEEP ALWAYS TO THE STRAIGHT ROAD THAN THOSE WHO WHILE THEY RUN FORSAKE IT
253-124400-0010 FOR MYSELF I HAVE NEVER FANCIED MY MIND TO BE IN ANY RESPECT MORE PERFECT THAN THOSE OF THE GENERALITY ON THE CONTRARY I HAVE OFTEN WISHED THAT I WERE EQUAL TO SOME OTHERS IN PROMPTITUDE OF THOUGHT OR IN CLEARNESS AND DISTINCTNESS OF IMAGINATION
253-124400-0011 OR IN FULLNESS AND READINESS OF MEMORY AND BESIDES THESE I KNOW OF NO OTHER QUALITIES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PERFECTION OF THE MIND
253-124400-0012 AND DISTINGUISHES US FROM THE BRUTES I AM DISPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS TO BE FOUND COMPLETE IN EACH INDIVIDUAL AND ON THIS POINT TO ADOPT THE COMMON OPINION OF PHILOSOPHERS WHO SAY THAT THE DIFFERENCE OF GREATER AND LESS HOLDS ONLY AMONG THE ACCIDENTS
253-124400-0013 I WILL NOT HESITATE HOWEVER TO AVOW MY BELIEF THAT IT HAS BEEN MY SINGULAR GOOD FORTUNE TO HAVE VERY EARLY IN LIFE FALLEN IN WITH CERTAIN TRACKS WHICH HAVE CONDUCTED ME TO CONSIDERATIONS AND MAXIMS OF WHICH I HAVE FORMED A METHOD THAT GIVES ME THE MEANS AS I THINK
253-124400-0014 OF GRADUALLY AUGMENTING MY KNOWLEDGE AND OF RAISING IT BY LITTLE AND LITTLE TO THE HIGHEST POINT WHICH THE MEDIOCRITY OF MY TALENTS AND THE BRIEF DURATION OF MY LIFE WILL PERMIT ME TO REACH FOR I HAVE ALREADY REAPED FROM IT SUCH FRUITS THAT
253-124400-0015 ALTHOUGH I HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO THINK LOWLY ENOUGH OF MYSELF AND ALTHOUGH WHEN I LOOK WITH THE EYE OF A PHILOSOPHER AT THE VARIED COURSES AND PURSUITS OF MANKIND AT LARGE I FIND SCARCELY ONE WHICH DOES NOT APPEAR IN VAIN AND USELESS
253-124400-0016 AND CANNOT HELP ENTERTAINING SUCH EXPECTATIONS OF THE FUTURE AS TO BELIEVE THAT IF AMONG THE OCCUPATIONS OF MEN AS MEN THERE IS ANY ONE REALLY EXCELLENT AND IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WHICH I HAVE CHOSEN AFTER ALL IT IS POSSIBLE I MAY BE MISTAKEN
253-124400-0017 AND IT IS BUT A LITTLE COPPER AND GLASS PERHAPS THAT I TAKE FOR GOLD AND DIAMONDS I KNOW HOW VERY LIABLE WE ARE TO DELUSION IN WHAT RELATES TO OURSELVES AND ALSO HOW MUCH THE JUDGMENTS OF OUR FRIENDS ARE TO BE SUSPECTED WHEN GIVEN IN OUR FAVOR
253-124400-0018 BUT I SHALL ENDEAVOR IN THIS DISCOURSE TO DESCRIBE THE PATHS I HAVE FOLLOWED AND TO DELINEATE MY LIFE AS IN A PICTURE IN ORDER THAT EACH ONE MAY ALSO BE ABLE TO JUDGE OF THEM FOR HIMSELF AND THAT IN THE GENERAL OPINION ENTERTAINED OF THEM AS GATHERED FROM CURRENT REPORT
253-124400-0019 I MYSELF MAY HAVE A NEW HELP TOWARDS INSTRUCTION TO BE ADDED TO THOSE I HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF EMPLOYING MY PRESENT DESIGN THEN IS NOT TO TEACH THE METHOD WHICH EACH OUGHT TO FOLLOW FOR THE RIGHT CONDUCT OF HIS REASON
253-124400-0020 BUT SOLELY TO DESCRIBE THE WAY IN WHICH I HAVE ENDEAVORED TO CONDUCT MY OWN THEY WHO SET THEMSELVES TO GIVE PRECEPTS MUST OF COURSE REGARD THEMSELVES AS POSSESSED OF GREATER SKILL THAN THOSE TO WHOM THEY PRESCRIBE
253-124400-0021 AND IF THEY ERR IN THE SLIGHTEST PARTICULAR THEY SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO CENSURE BUT AS THIS TRACT IS PUT FORTH MERELY AS A HISTORY OR IF YOU WILL AS A TALE IN WHICH AMID SOME EXAMPLES WORTHY OF IMITATION
253-124400-0022 THERE WILL BE FOUND PERHAPS AS MANY MORE WHICH IT WERE ADVISABLE NOT TO FOLLOW I HOPE IT WILL PROVE USEFUL TO SOME WITHOUT BEING HURTFUL TO ANY AND THAT MY OPENNESS WILL FIND SOME FAVOR WITH ALL
253-124400-0023 FROM MY CHILDHOOD I HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH LETTERS AND AS I WAS GIVEN TO BELIEVE THAT BY THEIR HELP A CLEAR AND CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THAT IS USEFUL IN LIFE MIGHT BE ACQUIRED I WAS ARDENTLY DESIROUS OF INSTRUCTION
253-124400-0024 BUT AS SOON AS I HAD FINISHED THE ENTIRE COURSE OF STUDY AT THE CLOSE OF WHICH IT IS CUSTOMARY TO BE ADMITTED INTO THE ORDER OF THE LEARNED I COMPLETELY CHANGED MY OPINION FOR I FOUND MYSELF INVOLVED IN SO MANY DOUBTS AND ERRORS
253-124400-0025 THAT I WAS CONVINCED I HAD ADVANCED NO FARTHER IN ALL MY ATTEMPTS AT LEARNING THAN THE DISCOVERY AT EVERY TURN OF MY OWN IGNORANCE AND YET I WAS STUDYING IN ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED SCHOOLS IN EUROPE IN WHICH I THOUGHT THERE MUST BE LEARNED MEN
253-124400-0026 IF SUCH WERE ANYWHERE TO BE FOUND I HAD BEEN TAUGHT ALL THAT OTHERS LEARNED THERE AND NOT CONTENTED WITH THE SCIENCES ACTUALLY TAUGHT US I HAD IN ADDITION READ ALL THE BOOKS THAT HAD FALLEN INTO MY HANDS
253-124400-0027 TREATING OF SUCH BRANCHES AS ARE ESTEEMED THE MOST CURIOUS AND RARE I KNEW THE JUDGMENT WHICH OTHERS HAD FORMED OF ME AND I DID NOT FIND THAT I WAS CONSIDERED INFERIOR TO MY FELLOWS
253-124400-0028 ALTHOUGH THERE WERE AMONG THEM SOME WHO WERE ALREADY MARKED OUT TO FILL THE PLACES OF OUR INSTRUCTORS AND IN FINE OUR AGE APPEARED TO ME AS FLOURISHING AND AS FERTILE IN POWERFUL MINDS AS ANY PRECEDING ONE
253-124400-0029 I WAS THUS LED TO TAKE THE LIBERTY OF JUDGING OF ALL OTHER MEN BY MYSELF AND OF CONCLUDING THAT THERE WAS NO SCIENCE IN EXISTENCE THAT WAS OF SUCH A NATURE AS I HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN GIVEN TO BELIEVE I STILL CONTINUED HOWEVER
253-124400-0030 TO HOLD IN ESTEEM THE STUDIES OF THE SCHOOLS I WAS AWARE THAT THE LANGUAGES TAUGHT IN THEM ARE NECESSARY TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE WRITINGS OF THE ANCIENTS THAT THE GRACE OF FABLE STIRS THE MIND THAT THE MEMORABLE DEEDS OF HISTORY ELEVATE IT AND
253-124400-0031 IF READ WITH DISCRETION AID IN FORMING THE JUDGMENT THAT THE PERUSAL OF ALL EXCELLENT BOOKS IS AS IT WERE TO INTERVIEW WITH THE NOBLEST MEN OF PAST AGES WHO HAVE WRITTEN THEM AND EVEN A STUDIED INTERVIEW IN WHICH ARE DISCOVERED TO US
253-124400-0032 ONLY THEIR CHOICEST THOUGHTS THAT ELOQUENCE HAS INCOMPARABLE FORCE AND BEAUTY THAT POESY HAS ITS RAVISHING GRACES AND DELIGHTS THAT IN THE MATHEMATICS THERE ARE MANY REFINED DISCOVERIES EMINENTLY SUITED TO GRATIFY THE INQUISITIVE
253-124400-0033 AS WELL AS FURTHER ALL THE ARTS AN LESSEN THE LABOUR OF MAN THAT NUMEROUS HIGHLY USEFUL PRECEPTS AND EXHORTATIONS TO VIRTUE ARE CONTAINED IN TREATISES ON MORALS THAT THEOLOGY POINTS OUT THE PATH TO HEAVEN
253-124400-0034 THAT PHILOSOPHY AFFORDS THE MEANS OF DISCOURSING WITH AN APPEARANCE OF TRUTH ON ALL MATTERS AND COMMANDS THE ADMIRATION OF THE MORE SIMPLE THAT JURISPRUDENCE MEDICINE AND THE OTHER SCIENCES SECURE FOR THEIR CULTIVATORS HONORS AND RICHES AND IN FINE
253-124400-0035 THAT IT IS USEFUL TO BESTOW SOME ATTENTION UPON ALL EVEN UPON THOSE ABOUNDING THE MOST IN SUPERSTITION AND ERROR THAT WE MAY BE IN A POSITION TO DETERMINE THEIR REAL VALUE AND GUARD AGAINST BEING DECEIVED
253-124400-0036 BUT I BELIEVED THAT I HAD ALREADY GIVEN SUFFICIENT TIME TO LANGUAGES AND LIKEWISE TO THE READING OF THE WRITINGS OF THE ANCIENTS TO THEIR HISTORIES AND FABLES
253-124400-0037 FOR TO HOLD CONVERSE WITH THOSE OF OTHER AGES AND TO TRAVEL ARE ALMOST THE SAME THING IT IS USEFUL TO KNOW SOMETHING OF THE MANNERS OF DIFFERENT NATIONS THAT WE MAY BE ENABLED TO FORM A MORE CORRECT JUDGMENT REGARDING OUR OWN
253-124400-0038 AND BE PREVENTED FROM THINKING THAT EVERYTHING CONTRARY TO OUR CUSTOMS IS RIDICULOUS AND IRRATIONAL A CONCLUSION USUALLY COME TO BY THOSE WHOSE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN LIMITED TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN TOO MUCH TIME IS OCCUPIED IN TRAVELING
253-124400-0039 WE BECOME STRANGERS TO OUR NATIVE COUNTRY AND THE OVER CURIOUS IN THE CUSTOMS OF THE PAST ARE GENERALLY IGNORANT OF THOSE OF THE PRESENT BESIDES FICTITIOUS NARRATIVES LEAD US TO IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITY OF MANY EVENTS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE
253-124400-0040 AND EVEN THE MOST FAITHFUL HISTORIES IF THEY DO NOT WHOLLY MISREPRESENT MATTERS OR EXAGGERATE THEIR IMPORTANCE TO RENDER THE ACCOUNT OF THEM MORE WORTHY OF PERUSAL OMIT AT LEAST ALMOST ALWAYS THE MEANEST AND LEAST STRIKING OF THE ATTENDANT CIRCUMSTANCES
253-124400-0041 HENCE IT HAPPENS THAT THE REMAINDER DOES NOT REPRESENT THE TRUTH AND THAT SUCH AS REGULATE THEIR CONDUCT BY EXAMPLES DRAWN FROM THIS SOURCE ARE APT TO FALL INTO THE EXTRAVAGANCES OF THE KNIGHT ERRANTS OF ROMANCE AND TO ENTERTAIN PROJECTS THAT EXCEED THEIR POWERS
253-124400-0042 I ESTEEMED ELOQUENCE HIGHLY AND WAS IN RAPTURES WITH POESY BUT I THOUGHT THAT BOTH WERE GIFTS OF NATURE RATHER THAN FRUITS OF STUDY THOSE IN WHOM THE FACULTY OF REASON IS PREDOMINANT AND WHO MOST SKILLFULLY DISPOSE THEIR THOUGHTS WITH A VIEW TO RENDER THEM CLEAR AND INTELLIGIBLE
253-124400-0043 ARE ALWAYS THE BEST ABLE TO PERSUADE OTHERS OF THE TRUTH OF WHAT THEY LAY DOWN THOUGH THEY SHOULD SPEAK ONLY IN THE LANGUAGE OF LOWER BRITTANY AND BE WHOLLY IGNORANT OF THE RULES OF RHETORIC AND THOSE WHOSE MINDS ARE STORED WITH THE MOST AGREEABLE FANCIES
253-124400-0044 AND WHO CAN GIVE EXPRESSION TO THEM WITH THE GREATEST EMBELLISHMENT AND HARMONY ARE STILL THE BEST POETS THOUGH UNACQUAINTED WITH THE ART OF POETRY I WAS ESPECIALLY DELIGHTED WITH THE MATHEMATICS ON ACCOUNT OF THE CERTITUDE AND EVIDENCE OF THEIR REASONINGS
253-124400-0045 BUT I HAD NOT AS YET A PRECISE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR TRUE USE AND THINKING THAT THEY BUT CONTRIBUTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE MECHANICAL ARTS I WAS ASTONISHED THAT FOUNDATIONS SO STRONG AND SOLID SHOULD HAVE HAD NO LOFTIER SUPERSTRUCTURE REARED ON THEM
253-124400-0046 ON THE OTHER HAND I COMPARED THE DISQUISITIONS OF THE ANCIENT MORALISTS TO VERY TOWERING AND MAGNIFICENT PALACES WITH NO BETTER FOUNDATION THAN SAND AND MUD THEY LAUD THE VIRTUES VERY HIGHLY AND EXHIBIT THEM AS ESTIMABLE FAR ABOVE ANYTHING ON EARTH
253-124400-0047 BUT THEY GIVE US NO ADEQUATE CRITERION OF VIRTUE AND FREQUENTLY THAT WHICH THEY DESIGNATE WITH SO FINE A NAME IS BUT APATHY OR PRIDE OR DESPAIR OR PARRICIDE I REVERED OUR THEOLOGY AND ASPIRED AS MUCH AS ANY ONE TO REACH HEAVEN
253-124400-0048 BUT BEING GIVEN ASSUREDLY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WAY IS NOT LESS OPEN TO THE MOST IGNORANT THAN TO THE MOST LEARNED AND THAT THE REVEALED TRUTHS WHICH LEAD TO HEAVEN ARE ABOVE OUR COMPREHENSION I DID NOT PRESUME TO SUBJECT THEM TO THE IMPOTENCY OF MY REASON
253-124400-0049 AND I THOUGHT THAT IN ORDER COMPETENTLY TO UNDERTAKE THEIR EXAMINATION THERE WAS NEED OF SOME SPECIAL HELP FROM HEAVEN AND OF BEING MORE THAN MAN
253-124400-0050 OF PHILOSOPHY I WILL SAY NOTHING EXCEPT THAT WHEN I SAW THAT IT HAD BEEN CULTIVATED FOR MANY AGES BY THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEN AND THAT YET THERE IS NOT A SINGLE MATTER WITHIN ITS SPHERE WHICH IS NOT STILL IN DISPUTE
253-124400-0051 AND NOTHING THEREFORE WHICH IS ABOVE DOUBT I DID NOT PRESUME TO ANTICIPATE THAT MY SUCCESS WOULD BE GREATER IN IT THAN THAT OF OTHERS AND FURTHER WHEN I CONSIDERED THE NUMBER OF CONFLICTING OPINIONS TOUCHING A SINGLE MATTER
253-124400-0052 THAT MAY BE UPHELD BY LEARNED MEN WHILE THERE CAN BE BUT ONE TRUE I RECKONED AS WELL NIGH FALSE ALL THAT WAS ONLY PROBABLE AS TO THE OTHER SCIENCES
253-124400-0053 I JUDGED THAT NO SOLID SUPERSTRUCTURES COULD BE REARED ON FOUNDATIONS SO INFIRM AND NEITHER THE HONOR NOR THE GAIN HELD OUT BY THEM WAS SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE ME TO THEIR CULTIVATION FOR I WAS NOT THANK HEAVEN
253-124400-0054 IN A CONDITION WHICH COMPELLED ME TO MAKE MERCHANDISE OF SCIENCE FOR THE BETTERING OF MY FORTUNE AND THOUGH I MIGHT NOT PROFESS TO SCORN GLORY AS A CYNIC
253-124400-0055 I YET MADE VERY SLIGHT ACCOUNT OF THAT HONOR WHICH I HOPED TO ACQUIRE ONLY THROUGH FICTITIOUS TITLES AND IN FINE OF FALSE SCIENCES I THOUGHT I KNEW THE WORTH SUFFICIENTLY TO ESCAPE BEING DECEIVED BY THE PROFESSIONS OF AN ALCHEMIST THE PREDICTIONS OF AN ASTROLOGER
253-124400-0056 THE IMPOSTURES OF A MAGICIAN OR BY THE ARTIFICES AND BOASTING OF ANY OF THOSE WHO PROFESS TO KNOW THINGS OF WHICH THEY ARE IGNORANT FOR THESE REASONS AS SOON AS MY AGE PERMITTED ME TO PASS FROM UNDER THE CONTROL OF MY INSTRUCTORS
253-124400-0057 I ENTIRELY ABANDONED THE STUDY OF LETTERS AND RESOLVED NO LONGER TO SEEK ANY OTHER SCIENCE THAN THE KNOWLEDGE OF MYSELF OR OF THE GREAT BOOK OF THE WORLD I SPENT THE REMAINDER OF MY YOUTH IN TRAVELING IN VISITING COURTS AND ARMIES
253-124400-0058 IN HOLDING INTERCOURSE WITH MEN OF DIFFERENT DISPOSITIONS AND RANKS IN COLLECTING VARIED EXPERIENCE IN PROVING MYSELF IN THE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS INTO WHICH FORTUNE THREW ME AND ABOVE ALL
253-124400-0059 IN MAKING SUCH REFLECTION ON THE MATTER OF MY EXPERIENCE AS TO SECURE MY IMPROVEMENT FOR IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I SHOULD FIND MUCH MORE TRUTH IN THE REASONINGS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL WITH REFERENCE TO THE AFFAIRS IN WHICH HE IS PERSONALLY INTERESTED
253-124400-0060 AND THE ISSUE OF WHICH MUST PRESENTLY PUNISH HIM IF HE HAS JUDGED AMISS THAN IN THOSE CONDUCTED BY A MAN OF LETTERS IN HIS STUDY REGARDING SPECULATIVE MATTERS THAT ARE OF NO PRACTICAL MOMENT AND FOLLOWED BY NO CONSEQUENCES TO HIMSELF FARTHER PERHAPS
253-124400-0061 THAN THAT THEY FOSTER HIS VANITY THE BETTER THE MORE REMOTE THEY ARE FROM COMMON SENSE REQUIRING AS THEY MUST IN THIS CASE THE EXERCISE OF GREATER INGENUITY AND ART TO RENDER THEM PROBABLE IN ADDITION
253-124400-0062 I HAD ALWAYS A MOST EARNEST DESIRE TO KNOW HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE TRUE FROM THE FALSE IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE CLEARLY TO DISCRIMINATE THE RIGHT PATH IN LIFE AND PROCEED IN IT WITH CONFIDENCE IT IS TRUE THAT
253-124400-0063 WHILE BUSIED ONLY IN CONSIDERING THE MANNERS OF OTHER MEN I FOUND HERE TOO SCARCE ANY GROUND FOR SETTLED CONVICTION AND REMARKED HARDLY LESS CONTRADICTION AMONG THEM THAN IN THE OPINIONS OF THE PHILOSOPHERS
253-124400-0064 SO THAT THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE I DERIVED FROM THE STUDY CONSISTED IN THIS THAT OBSERVING MANY THINGS WHICH HOWEVER EXTRAVAGANT AND RIDICULOUS TO OUR APPREHENSION
253-124400-0065 I LEARNED TO ENTERTAIN TOO DECIDED A BELIEF IN REGARD TO NOTHING OF THE TRUTH OF WHICH I HAD BEEN PERSUADED MERELY BY EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM AND THUS
253-124400-0066 I GRADUALLY EXTRICATED MYSELF FROM MANY ERRORS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DARKEN OUR NATURAL INTELLIGENCE AND INCAPACITATE US IN GREAT MEASURE FROM LISTENING TO REASON BUT AFTER I HAD BEEN OCCUPIED SEVERAL YEARS IN THUS STUDYING THE BOOK OF THE WORLD
253-124400-0067 AND IN ESSAYING TO GATHER SOME EXPERIENCE I AT LENGTH RESOLVED TO MAKE MYSELF AN OBJECT OF STUDY AND TO EMPLOY ALL THE POWERS OF MY MIND IN CHOOSING THE PATHS I OUGHT TO FOLLOW
