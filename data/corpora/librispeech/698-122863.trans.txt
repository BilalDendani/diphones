698-122863-0000 ANNE COMES TO GRIEF IN AN AFFAIR OF HONOR ANNE HAD TO LIVE THROUGH MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AS IT HAPPENED ALMOST A MONTH HAVING ELAPSED SINCE THE LINIMENT CAKE EPISODE IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR HER TO GET INTO FRESH TROUBLE OF SOME SORT LITTLE MISTAKES
698-122863-0001 SUCH AS ABSENTMINDEDLY EMPTYING A PAN OF SKIM MILK INTO A BASKET OF YARN BALLS IN THE PANTRY INSTEAD OF INTO THE PIGS BUCKET AND WALKING CLEAN OVER THE EDGE OF THE LOG BRIDGE INTO THE BROOK WHILE WRAPPED IN IMAGINATIVE REVERIE NOT REALLY BEING WORTH COUNTING
698-122863-0002 A WEEK AFTER THE TEA AT THE MANSE DIANA BARRY GAVE A PARTY SMALL AND SELECT ANNE ASSURED MARILLA JUST THE GIRLS IN OUR CLASS THEY HAD A VERY GOOD TIME AND NOTHING UNTOWARD HAPPENED UNTIL AFTER TEA WHEN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN THE BARRY GARDEN
698-122863-0003 A LITTLE TIRED OF ALL THEIR GAMES AND RIPE FOR ANY ENTICING FORM OF MISCHIEF WHICH MIGHT PRESENT ITSELF THIS PRESENTLY TOOK THE FORM OF DARING DARING WAS THE FASHIONABLE AMUSEMENT AMONG THE AVONLEA SMALL FRY JUST THEN IT HAD BEGUN AMONG THE BOYS BUT SOON SPREAD TO THE GIRLS
698-122863-0004 AND ALL THE SILLY THINGS THAT WERE DONE IN AVONLEA THAT SUMMER BECAUSE THE DOERS THEREOF WERE DARED TO DO THEM WOULD FILL A BOOK BY THEMSELVES FIRST OF ALL CARRIE SLOANE DARED RUBY GILLIS TO CLIMB TO A CERTAIN POINT IN THE HUGE OLD WILLOW TREE BEFORE THE FRONT DOOR WHICH RUBY GILLIS
698-122863-0005 ALBEIT IN MORTAL DREAD OF THE FAT GREEN CATERPILLARS WITH WHICH SAID TREE WAS INFESTED AND WITH THE FEAR OF HER MOTHER BEFORE HER EYES IF SHE SHOULD TEAR HER NEW MUSLIN DRESS NIMBLY DID
698-122863-0006 JOSIE'S TRIUMPH BEING RATHER MORE PRONOUNCED THAN GOOD TASTE PERMITTED ANNE SHIRLEY DARED HER TO WALK ALONG THE TOP OF THE BOARD FENCE WHICH BOUNDED THE GARDEN TO THE EAST NOW TO WALK BOARD FENCES REQUIRES MORE SKILL AND STEADINESS OF HEAD AND HEEL
698-122863-0007 THAN ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE WHO HAS NEVER TRIED IT BUT JOSIE PYE IF DEFICIENT IN SOME QUALITIES THAT MAKE FOR POPULARITY HAD AT LEAST A NATURAL AND INBORN GIFT DULY CULTIVATED FOR WALKING BOARD FENCES JOSIE WALKED THE BARRY FENCE WITH AN AIRY UNCONCERN WHICH SEEMED TO IMPLY
698-122863-0008 THAT A LITTLE THING LIKE THAT WASN'T WORTH A DARE RELUCTANT ADMIRATION GREETED HER EXPLOIT FOR MOST OF THE OTHER GIRLS COULD APPRECIATE IT HAVING SUFFERED MANY THINGS THEMSELVES IN THEIR EFFORTS TO WALK FENCES JOSIE DESCENDED FROM HER PERCH FLUSHED WITH VICTORY AND DARTED A DEFIANT GLANCE AT ANNE
698-122863-0009 ANNE TOSSED HER RED BRAIDS I DON'T THINK IT'S SUCH A VERY WONDERFUL THING TO WALK A LITTLE LOW BOARD FENCE SHE SAID I KNEW A GIRL IN MARYSVILLE WHO COULD WALK THE RIDGEPOLE OF A ROOF I DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID JOSIE FLATLY I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY COULD WALK A RIDGEPOLE
698-122863-0010 ALL THE FIFTH CLASS GIRLS SAID OH PARTLY IN EXCITEMENT PARTLY IN DISMAY DON'T YOU DO IT ANNE ENTREATED DIANA YOU'LL FALL OFF AND BE KILLED NEVER MIND JOSIE PYE IT ISN'T FAIR TO DARE ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING SO DANGEROUS I MUST DO IT
698-122863-0011 MY HONOR IS AT STAKE SAID ANNE SOLEMNLY I SHALL WALK THAT RIDGEPOLE DIANA OR PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT IF I AM KILLED YOU ARE TO HAVE MY PEARL BEAD RING ANNE CLIMBED THE LADDER AMID BREATHLESS SILENCE GAINED THE RIDGEPOLE
698-122863-0012 BALANCED HERSELF UPRIGHTLY ON THAT PRECARIOUS FOOTING AND STARTED TO WALK ALONG IT DIZZILY CONSCIOUS THAT SHE WAS UNCOMFORTABLY HIGH UP IN THE WORLD AND THAT WALKING RIDGEPOLES WAS NOT A THING IN WHICH YOUR IMAGINATION HELPED YOU OUT MUCH NEVERTHELESS
698-122863-0013 SHE MANAGED TO TAKE SEVERAL STEPS BEFORE THE CATASTROPHE CAME THEN SHE SWAYED LOST HER BALANCE STUMBLED STAGGERED AND FELL SLIDING DOWN OVER THE SUN BAKED ROOF AND CRASHING OFF IT THROUGH THE TANGLE OF VIRGINIA CREEPER BENEATH ALL BEFORE THE DISMAYED CIRCLE BELOW COULD GIVE A SIMULTANEOUS
698-122863-0014 TERRIFIED SHRIEK IF ANNE HAD TUMBLED OFF THE ROOF ON THE SIDE UP WHICH SHE HAD ASCENDED
698-122863-0015 FORTUNATELY SHE FELL ON THE OTHER SIDE WHERE THE ROOF EXTENDED DOWN OVER THE PORCH SO NEARLY TO THE GROUND THAT A FALL THEREFROM WAS A MUCH LESS SERIOUS THING NEVERTHELESS WHEN DIANA AND THE OTHER GIRLS HAD RUSHED FRANTICALLY AROUND THE HOUSE
698-122863-0016 THEY FOUND ANNE LYING ALL WHITE AND LIMP AMONG THE WRECK AND RUIN OF THE VIRGINIA CREEPER ANNE ARE YOU KILLED SHRIEKED DIANA THROWING HERSELF ON HER KNEES BESIDE HER FRIEND OH ANNE DEAR ANNE SPEAK JUST ONE WORD TO ME AND TELL ME IF YOU'RE KILLED TO THE IMMENSE RELIEF OF ALL THE GIRLS
698-122863-0017 AND ESPECIALLY OF JOSIE PYE WHO IN SPITE OF LACK OF IMAGINATION HAD BEEN SEIZED WITH HORRIBLE VISIONS OF A FUTURE BRANDED AS THE GIRL WHO WAS THE CAUSE OF ANNE SHIRLEY'S EARLY AND TRAGIC DEATH ANNE SAT DIZZILY UP AND ANSWERED UNCERTAINLY NO DIANA I AM NOT KILLED
698-122863-0018 BUT I THINK I AM RENDERED UNCONSCIOUS WHERE SOBBED CARRIE SLOANE OH WHERE ANNE BEFORE ANNE COULD ANSWER MISSUS BARRY APPEARED ON THE SCENE AT SIGHT OF HER ANNE TRIED TO SCRAMBLE TO HER FEET BUT SANK BACK AGAIN WITH A SHARP LITTLE CRY OF PAIN
698-122863-0019 WHAT'S THE MATTER WHERE HAVE YOU HURT YOURSELF DEMANDED MISSUS BARRY MY ANKLE GASPED ANNE OH DIANA PLEASE FIND YOUR FATHER AND ASK HIM TO TAKE ME HOME I KNOW I CAN NEVER WALK THERE AND I'M SURE I COULDN'T HOP SO FAR ON ONE FOOT WHEN JANE COULDN'T EVEN HOP AROUND THE GARDEN
698-122863-0020 MARILLA WAS OUT IN THE ORCHARD PICKING A PANFUL OF SUMMER APPLES WHEN SHE SAW MISTER BARRY COMING OVER THE LOG BRIDGE AND UP THE SLOPE WITH MISSUS BARRY BESIDE HIM AND A WHOLE PROCESSION OF LITTLE GIRLS TRAILING AFTER HIM IN HIS ARMS HE CARRIED ANNE WHOSE HEAD LAY LIMPLY AGAINST HIS SHOULDER
698-122863-0021 AT THAT MOMENT MARILLA HAD A REVELATION IN THE SUDDEN STAB OF FEAR THAT PIERCED HER VERY HEART SHE REALIZED WHAT ANNE HAD COME TO MEAN TO HER SHE WOULD HAVE ADMITTED THAT SHE LIKED ANNE NAY THAT SHE WAS VERY FOND OF ANNE BUT NOW SHE KNEW AS SHE HURRIED WILDLY DOWN THE SLOPE
698-122863-0022 THAT ANNE WAS DEARER TO HER THAN ANYTHING ELSE ON EARTH MISTER BARRY WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO HER SHE GASPED MORE WHITE AND SHAKEN THAN THE SELF CONTAINED SENSIBLE MARILLA HAD BEEN FOR MANY YEARS ANNE HERSELF ANSWERED LIFTING HER HEAD DON'T BE VERY FRIGHTENED MARILLA
698-122863-0023 I WAS WALKING THE RIDGEPOLE AND I FELL OFF I EXPECT I HAVE SPRAINED MY ANKLE BUT MARILLA I MIGHT HAVE BROKEN MY NECK LET US LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF THINGS I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN YOU'D GO AND DO SOMETHING OF THE SORT WHEN I LET YOU GO TO THAT PARTY SAID MARILLA SHARP AND SHREWISH IN HER VERY RELIEF
698-122863-0024 BRING HER IN HERE MISTER BARRY AND LAY HER ON THE SOFA MERCY ME THE CHILD HAS GONE AND FAINTED IT WAS QUITE TRUE OVERCOME BY THE PAIN OF HER INJURY ANNE HAD ONE MORE OF HER WISHES GRANTED TO HER SHE HAD FAINTED DEAD AWAY
698-122863-0025 MATTHEW HASTILY SUMMONED FROM THE HARVEST FIELD WAS STRAIGHTWAY DISPATCHED FOR THE DOCTOR WHO IN DUE TIME CAME TO DISCOVER THAT THE INJURY WAS MORE SERIOUS THAN THEY HAD SUPPOSED ANNE'S ANKLE WAS BROKEN
698-122863-0026 A PLAINTIVE VOICE GREETED HER FROM THE BED AREN'T YOU VERY SORRY FOR ME MARILLA IT WAS YOUR OWN FAULT SAID MARILLA TWITCHING DOWN THE BLIND AND LIGHTING A LAMP AND THAT IS JUST WHY YOU SHOULD BE SORRY FOR ME SAID ANNE
698-122863-0027 BECAUSE THE THOUGHT THAT IT IS ALL MY OWN FAULT IS WHAT MAKES IT SO HARD IF I COULD BLAME IT ON ANYBODY I WOULD FEEL SO MUCH BETTER BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE MARILLA IF YOU HAD BEEN DARED TO WALK A RIDGEPOLE I'D HAVE STAYED ON GOOD FIRM GROUND
698-122863-0028 AND LET THEM DARE AWAY SUCH ABSURDITY SAID MARILLA ANNE SIGHED BUT YOU HAVE SUCH STRENGTH OF MIND MARILLA I HAVEN'T I JUST FELT THAT I COULDN'T BEAR JOSIE PYE'S SCORN
698-122863-0029 AND I THINK I HAVE BEEN PUNISHED SO MUCH THAT YOU NEEDN'T BE VERY CROSS WITH ME MARILLA IT'S NOT A BIT NICE TO FAINT AFTER ALL AND THE DOCTOR HURT ME DREADFULLY WHEN HE WAS SETTING MY ANKLE I WON'T BE ABLE TO GO AROUND FOR SIX OR SEVEN WEEKS AND I'LL MISS THE NEW LADY TEACHER
698-122863-0030 SHE WON'T BE NEW ANY MORE BY THE TIME I'M ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND GIL EVERYBODY WILL GET AHEAD OF ME IN CLASS OH I AM AN AFFLICTED MORTAL
698-122863-0031 THERE THERE I'M NOT CROSS SAID MARILLA YOU'RE AN UNLUCKY CHILD THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT BUT AS YOU SAY YOU'LL HAVE THE SUFFERING OF IT HERE NOW TRY AND EAT SOME SUPPER ISN'T IT FORTUNATE I'VE GOT SUCH AN IMAGINATION SAID ANNE
698-122863-0032 IT WILL HELP ME THROUGH SPLENDIDLY I EXPECT WHAT DO PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T ANY IMAGINATION DO WHEN THEY BREAK THEIR BONES DO YOU SUPPOSE MARILLA ANNE HAD GOOD REASON TO BLESS HER IMAGINATION MANY A TIME AND OFT DURING THE TEDIOUS SEVEN WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED BUT SHE WAS NOT SOLELY DEPENDENT ON IT
698-122863-0033 SHE HAD MANY VISITORS AND NOT A DAY PASSED WITHOUT ONE OR MORE OF THE SCHOOLGIRLS DROPPING IN TO BRING HER FLOWERS AND BOOKS AND TELL HER ALL THE HAPPENINGS IN THE JUVENILE WORLD OF AVONLEA EVERYBODY HAS BEEN SO GOOD AND KIND MARILLA SIGHED ANNE HAPPILY
698-122863-0034 ON THE DAY WHEN SHE COULD FIRST LIMP ACROSS THE FLOOR IT ISN'T VERY PLEASANT TO BE LAID UP BUT THERE IS A BRIGHT SIDE TO IT MARILLA YOU FIND OUT HOW MANY FRIENDS YOU HAVE WHY EVEN SUPERINTENDENT BELL CAME TO SEE ME AND HE'S REALLY A VERY FINE MAN NOT A KINDRED SPIRIT OF COURSE
698-122863-0035 BUT STILL I LIKE HIM AND I'M AWFULLY SORRY I EVER CRITICIZED HIS PRAYERS I BELIEVE NOW HE REALLY DOES MEAN THEM ONLY HE HAS GOT INTO THE HABIT OF SAYING THEM AS IF HE DIDN'T HE COULD GET OVER THAT IF HE'D TAKE A LITTLE TROUBLE I GAVE HIM A GOOD BROAD HINT
698-122863-0036 HE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT THE TIME HE BROKE HIS ANKLE WHEN HE WAS A BOY IT DOES SEEM SO STRANGE TO THINK OF SUPERINTENDENT BELL EVER BEING A BOY EVEN MY IMAGINATION HAS ITS LIMITS FOR I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT WHEN I TRY TO IMAGINE HIM AS A BOY I SEE HIM WITH GRAY WHISKERS AND SPECTACLES
698-122863-0037 JUST AS HE LOOKS IN SUNDAY SCHOOL ONLY SMALL NOW IT'S SO EASY TO IMAGINE MISSUS ALLAN AS A LITTLE GIRL MISSUS ALLAN HAS BEEN TO SEE ME FOURTEEN TIMES ISN'T THAT SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF MARILLA WHEN A MINISTER'S WIFE HAS SO MANY CLAIMS ON HER TIME
698-122863-0038 SHE NEVER TELLS YOU IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT AND SHE HOPES YOU'LL BE A BETTER GIRL ON ACCOUNT OF IT MISSUS LYNDE ALWAYS TOLD ME THAT WHEN SHE CAME TO SEE ME AND SHE SAID IT IN A KIND OF WAY THAT MADE ME FEEL SHE MIGHT HOPE I'D BE A BETTER GIRL BUT DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE I WOULD EVEN JOSIE PYE CAME TO SEE ME
698-122863-0039 I RECEIVED HER AS POLITELY AS I COULD BECAUSE I THINK SHE WAS SORRY SHE DARED ME TO WALK A RIDGEPOLE IF I HAD BEEN KILLED SHE WOULD HAD TO CARRY A DARK BURDEN OF REMORSE ALL HER LIFE DIANA HAS BEEN A FAITHFUL FRIEND SHE'S BEEN OVER EVERY DAY TO CHEER MY LONELY PILLOW BUT OH
698-122863-0040 I SHALL BE SO GLAD WHEN I CAN GO TO SCHOOL FOR I'VE HEARD SUCH EXCITING THINGS ABOUT THE NEW TEACHER THE GIRLS ALL THINK SHE IS PERFECTLY SWEET DIANA SAYS SHE HAS THE LOVELIEST FAIR CURLY HAIR AND SUCH FASCINATING EYES SHE DRESSES BEAUTIFULLY AND HER SLEEVE PUFFS ARE BIGGER THAN ANYBODY ELSE'S IN AVONLEA
698-122863-0041 EVERY OTHER FRIDAY AFTERNOON SHE HAS RECITATIONS
698-122863-0042 OH IT'S JUST GLORIOUS TO THINK OF IT JOSIE PYE SAYS SHE HATES IT BUT THAT IS JUST BECAUSE JOSIE HAS SO LITTLE IMAGINATION DIANA AND RUBY GILLIS AND JANE ANDREWS ARE PREPARING A DIALOGUE CALLED A MORNING VISIT FOR NEXT FRIDAY
