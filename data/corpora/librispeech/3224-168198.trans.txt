3224-168198-0000 BEING ALL COME ABOARD THEY CONSIDER WHERE TO GET PROVISIONS ESPECIALLY FLESH SEEING THEY SCARCE EAT ANYTHING ELSE AND OF THIS THE MOST COMMON SORT IS PORK THE NEXT FOOD IS TORTOISES WHICH THEY SALT A LITTLE
3224-168198-0001 SOMETIMES THEY ROB SUCH OR SUCH HOG YARDS WHERE THE SPANIARDS OFTEN HAVE A THOUSAND HEAD OF SWINE TOGETHER THEY COME TO THESE PLACES IN THE NIGHT AND HAVING BESET THE KEEPER'S LODGE THEY FORCE HIM TO RISE AND GIVE THEM AS MANY HEADS AS THEY DESIRE THREATENING TO KILL HIM IF HE REFUSES
3224-168198-0002 HERE THEY ALLOW TWICE A DAY EVERY ONE AS MUCH AS HE CAN EAT WITHOUT WEIGHT OR MEASURE NOR DOES THE STEWARD OF THE VESSEL GIVE ANY MORE FLESH OR ANYTHING ELSE TO THE CAPTAIN THAN TO THE MEANEST MARINER THE SHIP BEING WELL VICTUALLED
3224-168198-0003 THEY DELIBERATE WHITHER THEY SHALL GO TO SEEK THEIR DESPERATE FORTUNES AND LIKEWISE AGREE UPON CERTAIN ARTICLES WHICH ARE PUT IN WRITING WHICH EVERY ONE IS BOUND TO OBSERVE AND ALL OF THEM OR THE CHIEFEST PART DO SET THEIR HANDS TO IT
3224-168198-0004 HERE THEY SET DOWN DISTINCTLY WHAT SUMS OF MONEY EACH PARTICULAR PERSON OUGHT TO HAVE FOR THAT VOYAGE THE FUND OF ALL THE PAYMENTS BEING WHAT IS GOTTEN BY THE WHOLE EXPEDITION FOR OTHERWISE IT IS THE SAME LAW AMONG THESE PEOPLE AS WITH OTHER PIRATES NO PREY NO PAY
3224-168198-0005 FIRST THEREFORE THEY MENTION HOW MUCH THE CAPTAIN IS TO HAVE FOR HIS SHIP NEXT THE SALARY OF THE CARPENTER OR SHIPWRIGHT WHO CAREENED MENDED AND RIGGED THE VESSEL THIS COMMONLY AMOUNTS TO ONE HUNDRED OR ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PIECES OF EIGHT ACCORDING TO THE AGREEMENT

3224-168198-0009 FOR A FINGER THE SAME AS FOR AN EYE ALL WHICH SUMS ARE TAKEN OUT OF THE COMMON STOCK OF WHAT IS GOTTEN BY THEIR PIRACY AND A VERY EXACT AND EQUAL DIVIDEND IS MADE OF THE REMAINDER THEY HAVE ALSO REGARD TO QUALITIES AND PLACES
3224-168198-0010 TO WHAT THE ORDINARY SEAMEN HAVE THE MASTER'S MATE ONLY TWO AND OTHER OFFICERS PROPORTIONATELY TO THEIR EMPLOY AFTER WHICH
3224-168198-0011 THE BOYS NOT BEING OMITTED WHO DRAW HALF A SHARE BECAUSE WHEN THEY TAKE A BETTER VESSEL THAN THEIR OWN IT IS IN THE BOYS DUTY TO FIRE THEIR FORMER VESSEL AND THEN RETIRE TO THE PRIZE THEY OBSERVE AMONG THEMSELVES VERY GOOD ORDERS
3224-168198-0012 FOR IN THE PRIZES WHICH THEY TAKE IT IS SEVERELY PROHIBITED TO EVERY ONE TO TAKE ANYTHING TO THEMSELVES HENCE ALL THEY TAKE IS EQUALLY DIVIDED AS HATH BEEN SAID BEFORE YEA THEY TAKE A SOLEMN OATH TO EACH OTHER
3224-168198-0013 NOT TO CONCEAL THE LEAST THING THEY FIND AMONG THE PRIZES AND IF ANY ONE IS FOUND FALSE TO THE SAID OATH HE IS IMMEDIATELY TURNED OUT OF THE SOCIETY THEY ARE VERY CIVIL AND CHARITABLE TO EACH OTHER SO THAT IF ANY ONE WANTS WHAT ANOTHER HAS
3224-168198-0014 THEY COMMONLY UNDERTAKE SOME MORE HAZARDOUS ENTERPRISES ONE REMARKABLE INSTANCE OF WHICH I SHALL HERE GIVE YOU A CERTAIN PIRATE CALLED PIERRE FRANCOIS OR PETER FRANCIS WAITING A LONG TIME AT SEA WITH HIS BOAT AND TWENTY SIX MEN
3224-168198-0015 AND NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND ANY PREY AT LAST HE RESOLVED TO DIRECT HIS COURSE TO RANCHEIRAS NEAR THE RIVER DE LA PLATA
3224-168198-0016 TWELVE VESSELS WITH A MAN OF WAR FOR THEIR DEFENCE EVERY VESSEL HAS AT LEAST TWO NEGROES IN IT WHO ARE VERY DEXTROUS IN DIVING TO THE DEPTH OF SIX FATHOMS WHERE THEY FIND GOOD STORE OF PEARLS ON THIS FLEET
3224-168198-0017 THE MAN OF WAR SCARCE HALF A LEAGUE DISTANT FROM THE SMALL SHIPS AND THE WIND VERY CALM
3224-168198-0018 HE RESOLVED TO ATTEMPT THE MAN OF WAR WITH WHICH ADDITION HE HOPED TO MASTER THE REST OF THE FLEET TO THIS END HE PRESENTLY SUNK HIS OWN BOAT PUTTING FORTH THE SPANISH COLOURS AND WEIGHED ANCHOR WITH A LITTLE WIND WHICH THEN BEGAN TO STIR HAVING WITH THREATS AND PROMISES COMPELLED
3224-168198-0019 MOST OF THE SPANIARDS TO ASSIST HIM BUT SO SOON AS THE MAN OF WAR PERCEIVED ONE OF HIS FLEET TO SAIL HE DID SO TOO FEARING LEST THE MARINERS DESIGNED TO RUN AWAY WITH THE RICHES THEY HAD ON BOARD
3224-168198-0020 THIS UNHAPPY EVENT MUCH ENCOURAGED THOSE IN THE MAN OF WAR THEY GAINING UPON THE PIRATES EVERY MOMENT AND AT LAST OVERTOOK THEM BUT FINDING THEY HAD TWENTY TWO SOUND MEN THE REST BEING EITHER KILLED OR WOUNDED RESOLVED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AS LONG AS POSSIBLE
3224-168198-0021 THIS THEY PERFORMED VERY COURAGEOUSLY FOR SOME TIME TILL THEY WERE FORCED BY THE MAN OF WAR ON CONDITION THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE USED AS SLAVES TO CARRY STONES OR BE EMPLOYED IN OTHER LABOURS FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS AS THEY SERVED THEIR NEGROES BUT THAT THEY SHOULD BE SET SAFE ASHORE ON FREE LAND
3224-168198-0022 ON THESE ARTICLES THEY YIELDED WITH ALL THEY HAD TAKEN WHICH WAS WORTH IN PEARLS ALONE
3224-168198-0023 BESIDES THE VESSEL PROVISIONS GOODS
3224-168198-0024 WHICH HE HAD CERTAINLY CARRIED OFF IF HIS MAIN MAST HAD NOT BEEN LOST AS WE SAID BEFORE ANOTHER BOLD ATTEMPT LIKE THIS NO LESS REMARKABLE I SHALL ALSO GIVE YOU
3224-168198-0025 WAS CRUISING IN A BOAT OF THIRTY MEN AND FOUR SMALL GUNS FROM JAMAICA
3224-168198-0026 AND CARTHAGENA BOUND FOR THE HAVANNAH WELL PROVIDED WITH TWENTY GREAT GUNS AND SEVENTY MEN PASSENGERS AND MARINERS THIS SHIP HE PRESENTLY ASSAULTED WHICH THEY ON BOARD AS RESOLUTELY DEFENDED
3224-168198-0027 THE PIRATE ESCAPING THE FIRST ENCOUNTER RESOLVED TO ATTACK HER MORE VIGOROUSLY THAN BEFORE SEEING HE HAD YET SUFFERED NO GREAT DAMAGE THIS HE PERFORMED WITH SO MUCH RESOLUTION THAT AT LAST AFTER A LONG AND DANGEROUS FIGHT HE BECAME MASTER OF IT
3224-168198-0028 THE PORTUGUESE LOST ONLY TEN MEN AND HAD FOUR WOUNDED SO THAT HE HAD STILL REMAINING TWENTY FIGHTING MEN WHEREAS THE SPANIARDS HAD DOUBLE THE NUMBER
3224-168198-0029 HAVING POSSESSED THEMSELVES OF THE SHIP THE WIND BEING CONTRARY TO RETURN TO JAMAICA THEY RESOLVED TO STEER TO CAPE SAINT ANTHONY WHICH LIES WEST OF CUBA THERE TO REPAIR AND TAKE IN FRESH WATER OF WHICH THEY WERE THEN IN GREAT WANT BEING VERY NEAR THE CAPE
3224-168198-0030 ABOVESAID THEY UNEXPECTEDLY MET WITH THREE GREAT SHIPS COMING FROM NEW SPAIN AND BOUND FOR THE HAVANNAH
3224-168198-0031 TWO DAYS AFTER THIS MISFORTUNE THERE AROSE A GREAT STORM WHICH SEPARATED THE SHIPS FROM ONE ANOTHER THE GREAT VESSEL WHERE THE PIRATES WERE ARRIVED AT CAMPECHY
3224-168198-0032 WHERE HE ARRIVED WITHIN A FORTNIGHT AFTER HIS ESCAPE DURING WHICH TIME AS ALSO AFTERWARDS HE ENDURED EXTREME HUNGER AND THIRST HAVING NO OTHER PROVISION WITH HIM THAN A SMALL CALABACA WITH A LITTLE WATER BESIDES THE FEARS OF FALLING AGAIN INTO THE HANDS OF THE SPANIARDS
3224-168198-0033 THEM LIKE KNIVES THOUGH NOT SO WELL
3224-168198-0034 THEY PRESENTLY GRANTED HIS REQUEST AND EQUIPPED HIM A BOAT ACCORDINGLY
3224-168198-0035 FOR BEING ARRIVED AT CAMPECHY WITH AN UNDAUNTED COURAGE AND WITHOUT ANY NOISE HE ASSAULTED THE SAID SHIP
3224-168198-0036 THAT IN A LITTLE TIME THEY COMPELLED THE SPANIARDS TO SURRENDER
