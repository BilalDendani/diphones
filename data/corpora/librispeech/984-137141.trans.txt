984-137141-0000 THIS BOOK IS MEANT TO BE A COMPANION TO HERETICS AND TO PUT THE POSITIVE SIDE IN ADDITION TO THE NEGATIVE MANY CRITICS COMPLAINED OF THE BOOK CALLED HERETICS BECAUSE IT MERELY CRITICISED CURRENT PHILOSOPHIES WITHOUT OFFERING ANY ALTERNATIVE PHILOSOPHY
984-137141-0001 THIS BOOK IS AN ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THE CHALLENGE IT IS UNAVOIDABLY AFFIRMATIVE AND THEREFORE UNAVOIDABLY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL THE WRITER HAS BEEN DRIVEN BACK UPON SOMEWHAT THE SAME DIFFICULTY AS THAT WHICH BESET NEWMAN IN WRITING HIS APOLOGIA
984-137141-0002 HE HAS BEEN FORCED TO BE EGOTISTICAL ONLY IN ORDER TO BE SINCERE WHILE EVERYTHING ELSE MAY BE DIFFERENT THE MOTIVE IN BOTH CASES IS THE SAME IT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE WRITER TO ATTEMPT AN EXPLANATION NOT OF WHETHER THE CHRISTIAN FAITH CAN BE BELIEVED
984-137141-0003 BUT OF HOW HE PERSONALLY HAS COME TO BELIEVE IT THE BOOK IS THEREFORE ARRANGED UPON THE POSITIVE PRINCIPLE OF A RIDDLE AND ITS ANSWER IT DEALS FIRST WITH ALL THE WRITER'S OWN SOLITARY AND SINCERE SPECULATIONS
984-137141-0004 THE ONLY POSSIBLE EXCUSE FOR THIS BOOK IS THAT IT IS AN ANSWER TO A CHALLENGE EVEN A BAD SHOT IS DIGNIFIED WHEN HE ACCEPTS A DUEL
984-137141-0005 WHEN SOME TIME AGO I PUBLISHED A SERIES OF HASTY BUT SINCERE PAPERS UNDER THE NAME OF HERETICS SEVERAL CRITICS FOR WHOSE INTELLECT I HAVE A WARM RESPECT
984-137141-0006 SAID THAT IT WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR ME TO TELL EVERYBODY TO AFFIRM HIS COSMIC THEORY BUT THAT I HAD CAREFULLY AVOIDED SUPPORTING MY PRECEPTS WITH EXAMPLE I WILL BEGIN TO WORRY ABOUT MY PHILOSOPHY SAID MISTER STREET WHEN MISTER CHESTERTON HAS GIVEN US HIS
984-137141-0007 IT WAS PERHAPS AN INCAUTIOUS SUGGESTION
984-137141-0008 BUT AFTER ALL THOUGH MISTER STREET HAS INSPIRED AND CREATED THIS BOOK HE NEED NOT READ IT IF HE DOES READ IT HE WILL FIND THAT IN ITS PAGES I HAVE ATTEMPTED IN A VAGUE AND PERSONAL WAY IN A SET OF MENTAL PICTURES RATHER THAN IN A SERIES OF DEDUCTIONS
984-137141-0009 TO STATE THE PHILOSOPHY IN WHICH I HAVE COME TO BELIEVE I WILL NOT CALL IT MY PHILOSOPHY FOR I DID NOT MAKE IT GOD AND HUMANITY MADE IT AND IT MADE ME
984-137141-0010 WHO SLIGHTLY MISCALCULATED HIS COURSE AND DISCOVERED ENGLAND UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS A NEW ISLAND IN THE SOUTH SEAS I ALWAYS FIND HOWEVER THAT I AM EITHER TOO BUSY OR TOO LAZY TO WRITE THIS FINE WORK
984-137141-0011 SO I MAY AS WELL GIVE IT AWAY FOR THE PURPOSES OF PHILOSOPHICAL ILLUSTRATION THERE WILL PROBABLY BE A GENERAL IMPRESSION THAT THE MAN WHO LANDED ARMED TO THE TEETH AND TALKING BY SIGNS TO PLANT THE BRITISH FLAG ON THAT BARBARIC TEMPLE
984-137141-0012 WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE THE PAVILION AT BRIGHTON FELT RATHER A FOOL I AM NOT HERE CONCERNED TO DENY THAT HE LOOKED A FOOL BUT IF YOU IMAGINE THAT HE FELT A FOOL OR AT ANY RATE THAT THE SENSE OF FOLLY WAS HIS SOLE OR HIS DOMINANT EMOTION
984-137141-0013 THEN YOU HAVE NOT STUDIED WITH SUFFICIENT DELICACY THE RICH ROMANTIC NATURE OF THE HERO OF THIS TALE HIS MISTAKE WAS REALLY A MOST ENVIABLE MISTAKE AND HE KNEW IT IF HE WAS THE MAN I TAKE HIM FOR
984-137141-0014 WHAT COULD BE MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN TO HAVE IN THE SAME FEW MINUTES ALL THE FASCINATING TERRORS OF GOING ABROAD COMBINED WITH ALL THE HUMANE SECURITY OF COMING HOME AGAIN WHAT COULD BE BETTER THAN TO HAVE ALL THE FUN OF DISCOVERING SOUTH AFRICA
984-137141-0015 WITHOUT THE DISGUSTING NECESSITY OF LANDING THERE WHAT COULD BE MORE GLORIOUS THAN TO BRACE ONE'S SELF UP TO DISCOVER NEW SOUTH WALES AND THEN REALIZE WITH A GUSH OF HAPPY TEARS THAT IT WAS REALLY OLD SOUTH WALES
984-137141-0016 THIS AT LEAST SEEMS TO ME THE MAIN PROBLEM FOR PHILOSOPHERS AND IS IN A MANNER THE MAIN PROBLEM OF THIS BOOK HOW CAN WE CONTRIVE TO BE AT ONCE ASTONISHED AT THE WORLD AND YET AT HOME IN IT
984-137141-0017 HOW CAN THIS QUEER COSMIC TOWN WITH ITS MANY LEGGED CITIZENS WITH ITS MONSTROUS AND ANCIENT LAMPS HOW CAN THIS WORLD GIVE US AT ONCE THE FASCINATION OF A STRANGE TOWN AND THE COMFORT AND HONOUR OF BEING OUR OWN TOWN
984-137141-0018 TO SHOW THAT A FAITH OR A PHILOSOPHY IS TRUE FROM EVERY STANDPOINT WOULD BE TOO BIG AN UNDERTAKING EVEN FOR A MUCH BIGGER BOOK THAN THIS IT IS NECESSARY TO FOLLOW ONE PATH OF ARGUMENT AND THIS IS THE PATH THAT I HERE PROPOSE TO FOLLOW
984-137141-0019 I WISH TO SET FORTH MY FAITH AS PARTICULARLY ANSWERING THIS DOUBLE SPIRITUAL NEED
984-137141-0020 ROMANCE FOR THE VERY WORD ROMANCE HAS IN IT THE MYSTERY AND ANCIENT MEANING OF ROME ANY ONE SETTING OUT TO DISPUTE ANYTHING OUGHT ALWAYS TO BEGIN BY SAYING WHAT HE DOES NOT DISPUTE
984-137141-0021 BEYOND STATING WHAT HE PROPOSES TO PROVE HE SHOULD ALWAYS STATE WHAT HE DOES NOT PROPOSE TO PROVE THE THING I DO NOT PROPOSE TO PROVE THE THING I PROPOSE TO TAKE AS COMMON GROUND BETWEEN MYSELF AND ANY AVERAGE READER
984-137141-0022 IS THIS DESIRABILITY OF AN ACTIVE AND IMAGINATIVE LIFE PICTURESQUE AND FULL OF A POETICAL CURIOSITY A LIFE SUCH AS WESTERN MAN AT ANY RATE ALWAYS SEEMS TO HAVE DESIRED
984-137141-0023 THEN HE IS NOT ONE OF THE ORDINARY PEOPLE TO WHOM I AM TALKING IF A MAN PREFERS NOTHING I CAN GIVE HIM NOTHING BUT NEARLY ALL PEOPLE I HAVE EVER MET IN THIS WESTERN SOCIETY IN WHICH I LIVE WOULD AGREE TO THE GENERAL PROPOSITION THAT WE NEED THIS LIFE OF
984-137141-0024 PRACTICAL ROMANCE THE COMBINATION OF SOMETHING THAT IS STRANGE WITH SOMETHING THAT IS SECURE
984-137141-0025 WE NEED TO BE HAPPY IN THIS WONDERLAND WITHOUT ONCE BEING MERELY COMFORTABLE IT IS THIS ACHIEVEMENT OF MY CREED THAT I SHALL CHIEFLY PURSUE IN THESE PAGES BUT I HAVE A PECULIAR REASON FOR MENTIONING THE MAN IN A YACHT
984-137141-0026 WHO DISCOVERED ENGLAND FOR I AM THAT MAN IN A YACHT I DISCOVERED ENGLAND I DO NOT SEE HOW THIS BOOK CAN AVOID BEING EGOTISTICAL AND I DO NOT QUITE SEE TO TELL THE TRUTH HOW IT CAN AVOID BEING DULL
984-137141-0027 DULNESS WILL HOWEVER FREE ME FROM THE CHARGE WHICH I MOST LAMENT THE CHARGE OF BEING FLIPPANT
984-137141-0028 I KNOW NOTHING SO CONTEMPTIBLE AS A MERE PARADOX A MERE INGENIOUS DEFENCE OF THE INDEFENSIBLE IF IT WERE TRUE AS HAS BEEN SAID THAT MISTER BERNARD SHAW LIVED UPON PARADOX THEN HE OUGHT TO BE A MERE COMMON MILLIONAIRE
984-137141-0029 FOR A MAN OF HIS MENTAL ACTIVITY COULD INVENT A SOPHISTRY EVERY SIX MINUTES IT IS AS EASY AS LYING BECAUSE IT IS LYING THE TRUTH IS OF COURSE THAT MISTER SHAW IS CRUELLY HAMPERED BY THE FACT THAT HE CANNOT TELL ANY LIE
984-137141-0030 UNLESS HE THINKS IT IS THE TRUTH I FIND MYSELF UNDER THE SAME INTOLERABLE BONDAGE I NEVER IN MY LIFE SAID ANYTHING MERELY BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT FUNNY THOUGH OF COURSE I HAVE HAD ORDINARY HUMAN VAINGLORY AND MAY HAVE THOUGHT IT FUNNY BECAUSE I HAD SAID IT
984-137141-0031 IT IS ONE THING TO DESCRIBE AN INTERVIEW WITH A GORGON OR A GRIFFIN A CREATURE WHO DOES NOT EXIST IT IS ANOTHER THING TO DISCOVER THAT THE RHINOCEROS DOES EXIST AND THEN TAKE PLEASURE IN THE FACT THAT HE LOOKS AS IF HE DIDN'T
984-137141-0032 ONE SEARCHES FOR TRUTH BUT IT MAY BE THAT ONE PURSUES INSTINCTIVELY THE MORE EXTRAORDINARY TRUTHS AND I OFFER THIS BOOK WITH THE HEARTIEST SENTIMENTS TO ALL THE JOLLY PEOPLE WHO HATE WHAT I WRITE
984-137141-0033 AND REGARD IT VERY JUSTLY FOR ALL I KNOW AS A PIECE OF POOR CLOWNING OR A SINGLE TIRESOME JOKE FOR IF THIS BOOK IS A JOKE IT IS A JOKE AGAINST ME I AM THE MAN WHO WITH THE UTMOST DARING DISCOVERED WHAT HAD BEEN DISCOVERED BEFORE
984-137141-0034 IF THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF FARCE IN WHAT FOLLOWS THE FARCE IS AT MY OWN EXPENSE FOR THIS BOOK EXPLAINS HOW I FANCIED I WAS THE FIRST TO SET FOOT IN BRIGHTON AND THEN FOUND I WAS THE LAST
984-137141-0035 NO ONE CAN THINK MY CASE MORE LUDICROUS THAN I THINK IT MYSELF
984-137141-0036 I AM THE FOOL OF THIS STORY AND NO REBEL SHALL HURL ME FROM MY THRONE I FREELY CONFESS ALL THE IDIOTIC AMBITIONS OF THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY I DID LIKE ALL OTHER SOLEMN LITTLE BOYS TRY TO BE IN ADVANCE OF THE AGE
984-137141-0037 LIKE THEM I TRIED TO BE SOME TEN MINUTES IN ADVANCE OF THE TRUTH AND I FOUND THAT I WAS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS BEHIND IT I DID STRAIN MY VOICE WITH A PAINFULLY JUVENILE EXAGGERATION IN UTTERING MY TRUTHS AND I WAS PUNISHED IN THE FITTEST AND FUNNIEST WAY
984-137141-0038 FOR I HAVE KEPT MY TRUTHS BUT I HAVE DISCOVERED NOT THAT THEY WERE NOT TRUTHS BUT SIMPLY THAT THEY WERE NOT MINE WHEN I FANCIED THAT I STOOD ALONE I WAS REALLY IN THE RIDICULOUS POSITION OF BEING BACKED UP BY ALL CHRISTENDOM IT MAY BE
984-137141-0039 HEAVEN FORGIVE ME THAT I DID TRY TO BE ORIGINAL BUT I ONLY SUCCEEDED IN INVENTING ALL BY MYSELF AN INFERIOR COPY OF THE EXISTING TRADITIONS OF CIVILIZED RELIGION THE MAN FROM THE YACHT THOUGHT HE WAS THE FIRST TO FIND ENGLAND I THOUGHT I WAS THE FIRST TO FIND EUROPE
984-137141-0040 I DID TRY TO FOUND A HERESY OF MY OWN AND WHEN I HAD PUT THE LAST TOUCHES TO IT I DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS ORTHODOXY IT MAY BE THAT SOMEBODY WILL BE ENTERTAINED BY THE ACCOUNT OF THIS HAPPY FIASCO
984-137141-0041 IT MIGHT AMUSE A FRIEND OR AN ENEMY TO READ HOW I GRADUALLY LEARNT FROM THE TRUTH OF SOME STRAY LEGEND OR FROM THE FALSEHOOD OF SOME DOMINANT PHILOSOPHY THINGS THAT I MIGHT HAVE LEARNT FROM MY CATECHISM IF I HAD EVER LEARNT IT
984-137141-0042 THERE MAY OR MAY NOT BE SOME ENTERTAINMENT IN READING HOW I FOUND AT LAST IN AN ANARCHIST CLUB OR A BABYLONIAN TEMPLE WHAT I MIGHT HAVE FOUND IN THE NEAREST PARISH CHURCH IF ANY ONE IS ENTERTAINED BY LEARNING HOW THE FLOWERS OF THE FIELD OR THE PHRASES IN AN OMNIBUS
984-137141-0043 THE ACCIDENTS OF POLITICS OR THE PAINS OF YOUTH CAME TOGETHER IN A CERTAIN ORDER TO PRODUCE A CERTAIN CONVICTION OF CHRISTIAN ORTHODOXY HE MAY POSSIBLY READ THIS BOOK BUT THERE IS IN EVERYTHING A REASONABLE DIVISION OF LABOUR
984-137141-0044 AND NOTHING ON EARTH WOULD INDUCE ME TO READ IT I ADD ONE PURELY PEDANTIC NOTE WHICH COMES AS A NOTE NATURALLY SHOULD AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK
984-137141-0045 THESE ESSAYS ARE CONCERNED ONLY TO DISCUSS THE ACTUAL FACT THAT THE CENTRAL CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY SUFFICIENTLY SUMMARIZED IN THE APOSTLES CREED IS THE BEST ROOT OF ENERGY AND SOUND ETHICS
984-137141-0046 THEY ARE NOT INTENDED TO DISCUSS THE VERY FASCINATING BUT QUITE DIFFERENT QUESTION OF WHAT IS THE PRESENT SEAT OF AUTHORITY FOR THE PROCLAMATION OF THAT CREED WHEN THE WORD ORTHODOXY IS USED HERE IT MEANS THE APOSTLES CREED
984-137141-0047 AS UNDERSTOOD BY EVERYBODY CALLING HIMSELF CHRISTIAN UNTIL A VERY SHORT TIME AGO AND THE GENERAL HISTORIC CONDUCT OF THOSE WHO HELD SUCH A CREED I HAVE BEEN FORCED BY MERE SPACE TO CONFINE MYSELF TO WHAT I HAVE GOT FROM THIS CREED
984-137141-0048 I DO NOT TOUCH THE MATTER MUCH DISPUTED AMONG MODERN CHRISTIANS OF WHERE WE OURSELVES GOT IT THIS IS NOT AN ECCLESIASTICAL TREATISE BUT A SORT OF SLOVENLY AUTOBIOGRAPHY
