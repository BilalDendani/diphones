5672-88363-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE SUBSTITUTE FOR THE SALOON THIS IS A SPECIAL COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER FIVE THE PICTURE OF CROWD SPLENDOR IT REFERS AS WELL TO EVERY OTHER TYPE OF MOVING PICTURE THAT GETS INTO THE SLUM
5672-88363-0001 BUT THE MASSES HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY AFFINITY FOR THE CROWD PHOTOPLAY AS HAS BEEN SAID BEFORE THE MOB COMES NIGHTLY TO BEHOLD ITS NATURAL FACE IN THE GLASS POLITICIANS ON THE PLATFORM HAVE SWAYED THE MASS BELOW THEM
5672-88363-0002 BUT NOW TO SPEAK IN AN IRISH WAY THE CROWD TAKES THE PLATFORM AND LOOKING DOWN SEES ITSELF SWAYING
5672-88363-0003 THE SLUMS ARE AN ASTONISHING ASSEMBLY OF CAVE MEN CRAWLING OUT OF THEIR SHELTERS TO EXHIBIT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY A COMMON INTEREST ON A TREMENDOUS SCALE IN AN ART FORM BELOW THE CLIFF CAVES WERE BAR ROOMS IN ENDLESS LINES
5672-88363-0004 THERE ARE ALMOST AS MANY BAR ROOMS TO DAY YET THIS NEW THING BREAKS THE LINES AS NOTHING ELSE EVER DID OFTEN WHEN A MOVING PICTURE HOUSE IS SET UP THE SALOON ON THE RIGHT HAND OR THE LEFT DECLARES BANKRUPTCY
5672-88363-0005 WHY DO MEN PREFER THE PHOTOPLAY TO THE DRINKING PLACE FOR NO PIOUS REASON SURELY NOW THEY HAVE FIRE POURING INTO THEIR EYES INSTEAD OF INTO THEIR BELLIES BLOOD IS DRAWN FROM THE GUTS TO THE BRAIN THOUGH THE PICTURE BE THE VERIEST MESS
5672-88363-0006 AFTER A DAY'S WORK A STREET SWEEPER ENTERS THE PLACE HEAVY AS KING LOG A DITCH DIGGER GOES IN SICK AND SURLY IT IS THE STATE OF THE BODY WHEN MANY MEN DRINK THEMSELVES INTO INSENSIBILITY BUT HERE THE LIGHT IS AS STRONG IN THE EYE AS WHISKEY IN THE THROAT
5672-88363-0007 IMMIGRANTS ARE PRODDED BY THESE SWORDS OF DARKNESS AND LIGHT TO GUESS AT THE MEANING OF THE CATCH PHRASES AND HEADLINES THAT PUNCTUATE THE PLAY THEY STRAIN TO HEAR THEIR NEIGHBORS WHISPER OR SPELL THEM OUT THE PHOTOPLAYS HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO REUNITE THE LOWER CLASS FAMILIES
5672-88363-0008 NO LONGER IS THE FIRE ESCAPE THE ONLY SUMMER RESORT FOR BIG AND LITTLE FOLKS HERE IS MORE FANCY AND WHIM THAN EVER BEFORE BLESSED A HOT NIGHT
5672-88363-0009 HERE UNDER THE WIND OF AN ELECTRIC FAN THEY WITNESS EVERYTHING FROM A BURIAL IN WESTMINSTER TO THE BIRTHDAY PARADE OF THE RULER OF THE LAND OF SWAT THE USUAL SALOON EQUIPMENT TO DELIGHT THE EYE IS ONE SO CALLED LEG PICTURE OF A WOMAN
5672-88363-0010 A PHOTOGRAPH OF A PRIZE FIGHTER AND SOME COLORED PORTRAITS OF GOATS TO ADVERTISE VARIOUS BRANDS OF BEER MANY TIMES NO DOUBT THESE BOYS AND YOUNG MEN HAVE FOUND VISIONS OF A SORDID KIND WHILE GAZING ON THE ACTRESS THE FIGHTER OR THE GOATS
5672-88363-0011 BUT WHAT POOR MATERIAL THEY HAD IN THE WARDROBES OF MEMORY FOR THE TRIMMINGS AND HABILIMENTS OF VISION TO MAKE THIS LADY INTO FREYA THIS PRIZE FIGHTER INTO THOR THESE GOATS INTO THE HARNESSED STEEDS THAT DREW HIS CHARIOT
5672-88363-0012 MAN'S DREAMS ARE REARRANGED AND GLORIFIED MEMORIES HOW COULD THESE PEOPLE RECONSTRUCT THE TORN CARPETS AND TIN CANS AND WASTE PAPER OF THEIR LIVES INTO MYTHOLOGY
5672-88363-0013 THE THINGS THEY DRANK TO SEE AND SAW BUT GROTESQUELY AND PAID FOR TERRIBLY NOW ROLL BEFORE THEM WITH NO AFTER PAIN OR PUNISHMENT THE MUMBLED CONVERSATION THE SOCIABILITY FOR WHICH THEY LEANED OVER THE TABLES
5672-88363-0014 THEY HAVE HERE IN THE SAME MANNER WITH FAR MORE TO TALK ABOUT THEY COME THEY GO HOME MEN AND WOMEN TOGETHER AS CASUALLY AND IMPULSIVELY AS THE MEN ALONE EVER ENTERED A DRINKING PLACE BUT DISCOURSING NOW OF FAR OFF MOUNTAINS AND STAR CROSSED LOVERS
5672-88363-0015 BUT LET US GO TO THE OTHER END OF THE TEMPERANCE ARGUMENT I BEG TO BE ALLOWED TO RELATE A PERSONAL MATTER FOR SOME TIME I WAS A FIELD WORKER FOR THE ANTI SALOON LEAGUE OF ILLINOIS
5672-88363-0016 BEING SENT EVERY SUNDAY TO A NEW REGION TO MAKE THE YEARLY VISIT ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE SUCH A VISITOR IS APT TO SPEAK TO ONE CHURCH IN A VILLAGE AND TWO IN THE COUNTRY ON EACH EXCURSION BEING MET AT THE STATION BY SOME LEADING FARMER CITIZEN OF THE SECTION
5672-88363-0017 AND DRIVEN TO THESE POINTS BY HIM THE TALK WITH THIS MAN WAS WORTH IT ALL TO ME THE AGRICULTURAL TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES IS NATURALLY DRY
5672-88363-0018 THIS IS BECAUSE THE CROSS ROADS CHURCH IS THE ONLY COMMUNAL INSTITUTION AND THE VOICE OF THE CROSS ROADS PASTOR IS FOR TEETOTALISM THE ROUTINE OF THE FARM HAND WHILE BY NO MEANS IDEAL IN OTHER RESPECTS KEEPS HIM FROM CRAVING DRINK AS INTENSELY AS OTHER TOILERS DO
5672-88363-0019 SO OPPOSITION TO THE TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT IS SCATTERING THE ANTI SALOON LEAGUE HAS ORGANIZED THESE LEADERS INTO A NATION WIDE MACHINE IT SEES THAT THEY GET THEIR WEEKLY PAPER INSTRUCTING THEM IN THE TACTICS WHEREBY LOCAL FIGHTS HAVE BEEN WON
5672-88363-0020 A SUBSCRIPTION FINANCING THE STATE LEAGUE IS TAKEN ONCE A YEAR IT COUNTS ON THE REGULAR LIST OF CHURCH BENEVOLENCES
5672-88363-0021 ANY COUNTRY POLITICIAN FEARS THEIR NON PARTISAN DENUNCIATION AS HE DOES POLITICAL DEATH THE LOCAL MACHINES THUS BACKED ARE INCURABLE MUGWUMPS HOLD THE BALANCE OF POWER WORK IN BOTH PARTIES
5672-88363-0022 AND HAVE VOTED DRY THE AGRICULTURAL TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES EVERYWHERE BY THE TOWNSHIP COUNTY OR STATE UNIT THE ONLY INSTITUTIONS THAT TOUCH THE SAME TERRITORY IN A SIMILAR WAY ARE THE CHAUTAUQUAS IN THE PROSPEROUS AGRICULTURAL CENTRES
5672-88363-0023 THESE TOO BY THE SAME SIGN ARE EMPHATICALLY ANTI SALOON IN THEIR PROPAGANDA SERVING TO INTELLECTUALIZE AND SECULARIZE THE DRY SENTIMENT WITHOUT TAKING IT OUT OF THE AGRICULTURAL CASTE THERE IS A DEFINITE LINE BETWEEN OUR FARM CIVILIZATION AND THE REST
5672-88363-0024 WHEN A COUNTY GOES DRY IT IS GENERALLY IN SPITE OF THE COUNTY SEAT SUCH TEMPERANCE PEOPLE AS ARE IN THE COURT HOUSE TOWN REPRESENT THE CHURCH VOTE WHICH IS EVEN THEN IN GOODLY PROPORTION A RETIRED FARMER VOTE
5672-88363-0025 THE LARGER THE COUNTY SEAT THE LARGER THE NON CHURCH GOING POPULATION AND THE MORE STUBBORN THE FIGHT THE MAJORITY OF MINERS AND FACTORY WORKERS ARE ON THE WET SIDE EVERYWHERE THE IRRITATION CAUSED BY THE GASES IN THE MINES BY THE DIRTY WORK IN THE BLACKNESS
5672-88363-0026 BY THE SQUALOR IN WHICH THE COMPANY HOUSES ARE BUILT TURNS MEN TO DRINK FOR REACTION AND LAMPLIGHT AND COMRADESHIP THE SIMILAR FEVERS AND EXASPERATIONS OF FACTORY LIFE LEAD THE WORKERS TO UNSTRING THEIR TENSE NERVES WITH LIQUOR
5672-88363-0027 THE HABIT OF SNUGGLING UP CLOSE IN FACTORIES CONVERSING OFTEN BENCH BY BENCH MACHINE BY MACHINE INCLINES THEM TO GET TOGETHER FOR THEIR PLEASURES AT THE BAR IN INDUSTRIAL AMERICA THERE IS AN ANTI SALOON MINORITY IN MORAL SYMPATHY
5672-88363-0028 WITH THE TEMPERANCE WAVE BROUGHT IN BY THE FARMERS BUT THEY ARE OUTSTANDING GROUPS THEIR LEADERSHIP SELDOM DRIES UP A FACTORY TOWN OR A MINING REGION WITH ALL THE HELP THE ANTI SALOON LEAGUE CAN GIVE IN THE BIG CITIES THE TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT IS SCARCELY UNDERSTOOD
5672-88363-0029 THE CHOICE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS ARE VOTED DRY FOR REAL ESTATE REASONS THE MEN WHO DO THIS DRINK FREELY AT THEIR OWN CLUBS OR PARTIES
5672-88363-0030 THERE IS A PROPHECY ABROAD THAT PROHIBITION WILL BE THE ISSUE OF A NATIONAL ELECTION IF THE QUESTION IS SQUARELY PUT THERE ARE ENOUGH FARMERS AND CHURCH PEOPLE TO DRIVE THE SALOON OUT OF LEGAL EXISTENCE THE WOMEN'S VOTE A LITTLE MORE PURITANICAL THAN THE MEN'S VOTE
5672-88363-0031 WHAT WILL BECOME OF THOSE ALL BUT UNBROKEN LINES OF SLUM SALOONS NO LESSER FORCE THAN REGULAR TROOPS COULD DISLODGE THEM WITH YESTERDAY'S INTRENCHMENT THE ENTRANCE OF THE MOTION PICTURE HOUSE INTO THE ARENA IS INDEED STRIKING
5672-88363-0032 THE FIRST ENEMY OF KING ALCOHOL WITH REAL POWER WHERE THAT KING HAS DEEPEST HOLD IF EVERY ONE OF THOSE SALOON DOORS IS NAILED UP BY THE CHAUTAUQUA ORATORS THE PHOTOPLAY ARCHWAY WILL REMAIN OPEN
5672-88363-0033 THE PEOPLE WILL HAVE A SHELTER WHERE THEY CAN READJUST THEMSELVES THAT OFFERS A SUBSTITUTE FOR MANY OF THE LINES OF PLEASURE IN THE GROGGERY AND A WHOLE EVENING COSTS BUT A DIME APIECE SEVERAL ROUNDS OF DRINKS ARE EXPENSIVE
5672-88363-0034 BUT THE PEOPLE CAN SIT THROUGH AS MANY REPETITIONS OF THIS PROGRAMME AS THEY DESIRE FOR ONE ENTRANCE FEE THE DOMINANT GENIUS OF THE MOVING PICTURE PLACE IS NOT A GENTLEMAN WITH A RED NOSE AND AN EYE LIKE A DEAD FISH BUT SOME PRODUCER WHO WITH ALL HIS FAULTS
5672-88363-0035 HAS GIVEN EVERY PERSON IN THE AUDIENCE A SEVEN LEAGUED ANGEL AND DEMON TELESCOPE SINCE I HAVE ANNOUNCED MYSELF A FARMER AND A PURITAN LET ME HERE LIST THE SALOON EVILS NOT YET RECORDED IN THIS CHAPTER THEY ARE SEPARATE FROM THE CATALOGUE OF THE INDIVIDUALISTIC WOES OF THE DRUNKARD
5672-88363-0036 THAT ARE GIVEN IN THE SCRIPTURE THE SHAME OF THE AMERICAN DRINKING PLACE IS THE BAR TENDER WHO DOMINATES ITS THINKING HIS CYNICAL AND HARDENED SOUL WIPES OUT A PORTION OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL THE LIBRARY THE SELF RESPECTING NEWSPAPER A STREAM RISES NO HIGHER THAN ITS SOURCE
5672-88363-0037 SO GOOD CITIZEN WELCOME THE COMING OF THE MOVING PICTURE MAN AS A LOCAL SOCIAL FORCE WHATEVER HIS PRIVATE CHARACTER THE MERE FORMULA OF HIS ACTIVITIES MAKES HIM A BETTER TYPE HE MAY NOT AT FIRST SWAY HIS GROUP IN A DIRECTLY POLITICAL WAY
5672-88363-0038 BUT HE WILL MAKE HIMSELF THE CENTRE OF MORE SOCIAL IDEALS THAN THE BAR TENDER EVER ENTERTAINED AND HE IS BEGINNING TO HAVE AS INTIMATE A RELATION TO HIS PUBLIC AS THE BAR TENDER IN MANY CASES HE STANDS UNDER HIS ARCH IN THE SHELTERED LOBBY
5672-88363-0039 AND IS ON CONVERSING TERMS WITH HIS HABITUAL CUSTOMERS THE LENGTH OF THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING VOTING THE SALOON OUT OF THE SLUMS BY VOTING AMERICA DRY DOES NOT AS OF OLD PROMISE TO BE A SUCCESSFUL OPERATION THAT KILLS THE PATIENT
5672-88363-0040 THE ANTI SALOON LEAGUE OFFICERS AND THE PHOTOPLAY MEN SHOULD ASK EACH OTHER TO DINNER MORE MOVING PICTURE THEATRES IN DOUBTFUL TERRITORY WILL HELP MAKE DRY VOTERS AND WET TERRITORY VOTED DRY WILL BRING ABOUT A GREATLY ACCELERATED PATRONAGE OF THE PHOTOPLAY HOUSES
5672-88363-0041 THERE IS EVERY STRATEGIC REASON WHY THESE TWO FORCES SHOULD PATCH UP A TRUCE
