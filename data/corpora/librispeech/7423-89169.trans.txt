7423-89169-0036 WITH EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF STOCK TO HIS NAME I SAW REGGIE'S EYES GO UP TO THE CEILING AND I KNEW HE WAS DIVIDING EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS BY FIVE AN EXPRESSION ALMOST OF REVERENCE PASSED INTO HIS FACE AS HE ACHIEVED THE RESULT
7423-89169-0037 WE NONE OF US FELT THE SLIGHTEST INCLINATION TO INTERRUPT
7423-89169-0038 THEN SHE COUGHED THE SHORT DRY COUGH OF THE PROFESSIONAL SPEAKER AND CONTINUED WOULDN'T YOU BELIEVE THAT WAS SUCCESS ENOUGH FOR ANY REASONABLE MORTAL WOULDN'T YOU SAY THAT WITH A WIFE HOLDING AN HONORED AND GREAT POSITION IN THE STATE

7423-89169-0057 I THINK I SUGGESTED A LITTLE TAXI DRIVE YOUR MOTHER AND FATHER NO DOUBT HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER AND YOU CAN RECEIVE YOUR LITTLE LECTURE LATER EVE ASSENTED AT ONCE
7423-89169-0058 AND MISSUS BUNDERCOMBE FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER ONLY ENTERED A FAINT PROTEST AGAINST OUR DEPARTURE IT WAS ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AND THE STREETS WERE CROWDED WITH EVERY DESCRIPTION OF VEHICLE THE SUN WAS STILL WARM
7423-89169-0059 THERE WAS A FAINT PINK LIGHT IN THE SKY A PERFUME OF LILAC IN THE AIR FROM THE WINDOW BOXES AND FLOWER BARROWS I TOOK EVE'S FINGERS IN MINE AND HELD THEM I THINK SHE KNEW THAT SOMETHING IN THE NATURE OF AN INQUISITION WAS COMING
7423-89169-0060 FOR SHE SAT VERY DEMURE HER EYES FIXED ON THE ROAD AHEAD EVE I ASKED HOW ABOUT MISSUS SAMUELSON'S JEWELS THEY WERE RETURNED TO HER FROM A REPENTANT CRIMINAL EVE MURMURED

7423-89169-0065 BY THE BY I ADDED PUTTING MY HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW I THINK IT'S GETTING A LITTLE CHILLY I ORDERED THE TAXI CLOSED AND WE RETURNED TO THE HOTEL THE HALL PORTER DREW ME ON ONE SIDE CONFIDENTIALLY
