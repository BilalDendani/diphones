6153-62534-0000 CYRUS HARDING AND HIS COMPANIONS SLEPT LIKE INNOCENT MARMOTS IN THE CAVE WHICH THE JAGUAR HAD SO POLITELY LEFT AT THEIR DISPOSAL
6153-62534-0001 AND THEIR GAZE WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE HORIZON OF WHICH TWO THIRDS OF THE CIRCUMFERENCE WERE VISIBLE FOR THE LAST TIME THE ENGINEER COULD ASCERTAIN THAT NOT A SAIL NOR THE WRECK OF A SHIP WAS ON THE SEA AND EVEN WITH THE TELESCOPE NOTHING SUSPICIOUS COULD BE DISCOVERED
6153-62534-0002 THERE WAS NOTHING EITHER ON THE SHORE AT LEAST IN THE STRAIGHT LINE OF THREE MILES WHICH FORMED THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE PROMONTORY FOR BEYOND THAT RISING GROUND HAD THE REST OF THE COAST AND EVEN FROM THE EXTREMITY
6153-62534-0003 THIS WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THEIR FIRST PLAN IN FACT WHEN THE BOAT WAS ABANDONED AT THE SOURCES OF THE MERCY IT HAD BEEN AGREED THAT AFTER HAVING SURVEYED THE WEST COAST THEY SHOULD GO BACK TO IT AND RETURN TO GRANITE HOUSE BY THE MERCY
6153-62534-0004 HARDING THEN THOUGHT THAT THE WESTERN COAST WOULD HAVE OFFERED REFUGE EITHER TO A SHIP IN DISTRESS OR TO A VESSEL IN HER REGULAR COURSE BUT NOW AS HE SAW THAT THIS COAST PRESENTED NO GOOD ANCHORAGE HE WISHED TO SEEK ON THE SOUTH
6153-62534-0005 WHAT THEY HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ON THE WEST GIDEON SPILETT PROPOSED TO CONTINUE THE EXPLORATION THAT THE QUESTION OF THE SUPPOSED WRECK MIGHT BE COMPLETELY SETTLED AND HE ASKED AT WHAT DISTANCE CLAW CAPE MIGHT BE FROM THE EXTREMITY OF THE PENINSULA
6153-62534-0006 ABOUT THIRTY MILES REPLIED THE ENGINEER IF WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE CURVINGS OF THE COAST THIRTY MILES RETURNED SPILETT THAT WOULD BE A LONG DAY'S MARCH NEVERTHELESS I THINK THAT WE SHOULD RETURN TO GRANITE HOUSE BY THE SOUTH COAST
6153-62534-0007 BUT OBSERVED HERBERT FROM CLAW CAPE TO GRANITE HOUSE THERE MUST BE AT LEAST ANOTHER TEN MILES MAKE IT FORTY MILES IN ALL REPLIED THE ENGINEER
6153-62534-0008 AT LEAST WE SHOULD SURVEY THE UNKNOWN SHORE AND THEN WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO BEGIN THE EXPLORATION AGAIN VERY GOOD SAID PENCROFT BUT THE BOAT THE BOAT HAS REMAINED BY ITSELF FOR ONE DAY AT THE SOURCES OF THE MERCY REPLIED GIDEON SPILETT
6153-62534-0009 IT MAY JUST AS WELL STAY THERE TWO DAYS AS YET WE HAVE HAD NO REASON TO THINK THAT THE ISLAND IS INFESTED BY THIEVES YET SAID THE SAILOR WHEN I REMEMBER THE HISTORY OF THE TURTLE I AM FAR FROM CONFIDENT OF THAT
6153-62534-0010 WHO KNOWS MURMURED THE ENGINEER BUT SAID
6153-62534-0011 BY THE MERCY OF COURSE REPLIED HERBERT AND WE SHALL HAVE NEITHER BRIDGE NOR BOAT BY WHICH TO CROSS BUT CAPTAIN ADDED PENCROFT WITH A FEW FLOATING TRUNKS WE SHALL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN CROSSING THE RIVER
6153-62534-0012 A BRIDGE CRIED PENCROFT WELL IS NOT THE CAPTAIN THE BEST ENGINEER IN HIS PROFESSION HE WILL MAKE US A BRIDGE WHEN WE WANT ONE AS TO TRANSPORTING YOU THIS EVENING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MERCY AND THAT WITHOUT WETTING ONE THREAD OF YOUR CLOTHES
6153-62534-0013 I WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT WE HAVE PROVISIONS FOR ANOTHER DAY AND BESIDES WE CAN GET PLENTY OF GAME FORWARD
6153-62534-0014 BUT THERE WAS NOT AN HOUR TO LOSE FOR FORTY MILES WAS A LONG MARCH AND THEY COULD NOT HOPE TO REACH GRANITE HOUSE BEFORE NIGHT AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE LITTLE BAND SET OUT AS A PRECAUTION THE GUNS WERE LOADED WITH BALL AND TOP WHO LED THE VAN
6153-62534-0015 RECEIVED ORDERS TO BEAT ABOUT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST FROM THE EXTREMITY OF THE PROMONTORY WHICH FORMED THE TAIL OF THE PENINSULA THE COAST WAS ROUNDED FOR A DISTANCE OF FIVE MILES WHICH WAS RAPIDLY PASSED OVER
6153-62534-0016 WITHOUT EVEN THE MOST MINUTE INVESTIGATIONS BRINGING TO LIGHT THE LEAST TRACE OF ANY OLD OR RECENT LANDINGS NO DEBRIS NO MARK OF AN ENCAMPMENT NO CINDERS OF A FIRE NOR EVEN A FOOTPRINT FROM THE POINT OF THE PENINSULA
6153-62534-0017 APPEARED AS IF SUSPENDED BETWEEN LAND AND WATER BETWEEN THE PLACE OCCUPIED BY THE COLONISTS AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE IMMENSE BAY THE SHORE WAS COMPOSED FIRST OF A TRACT OF LOW LAND BORDERED IN THE BACKGROUND BY TREES
6153-62534-0018 THEN THE SHORE BECAME MORE IRREGULAR PROJECTING SHARP POINTS INTO THE SEA AND FINALLY ENDED IN THE BLACK ROCKS WHICH ACCUMULATED IN PICTURESQUE DISORDER FORMED CLAW CAPE
6153-62534-0019 SUCH WAS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PART OF THE ISLAND WHICH THE SETTLERS TOOK IN AT A GLANCE WHILE STOPPING FOR AN INSTANT IF A VESSEL RAN IN HERE SAID PENCROFT SHE WOULD CERTAINLY BE LOST SANDBANKS AND REEFS EVERYWHERE BAD QUARTERS
6153-62534-0020 BUT AT LEAST SOMETHING WOULD BE LEFT OF THE SHIP OBSERVED THE REPORTER THERE MIGHT BE PIECES OF WOOD ON THE ROCKS BUT NOTHING ON THE SANDS REPLIED THE SAILOR WHY
6153-62534-0021 IN A FEW DAYS THE HULL OF A SHIP OF SEVERAL HUNDRED TONS WOULD DISAPPEAR ENTIRELY IN THERE SO PENCROFT ASKED THE ENGINEER IF A SHIP HAS BEEN WRECKED ON THESE BANKS IS IT NOT ASTONISHING THAT THERE IS NOW NO TRACE OF HER REMAINING
6153-62534-0022 NO CAPTAIN WITH THE AID OF TIME AND TEMPEST HOWEVER IT WOULD BE SURPRISING EVEN IN THIS CASE THAT SOME OF THE MASTS OR SPARS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THROWN ON THE BEACH OUT OF REACH OF THE WAVES LET US GO ON WITH OUR SEARCH THEN RETURNED CYRUS HARDING
6153-62534-0023 THE LONG SEA SWELL COULD BE SEEN BREAKING OVER THE ROCKS IN THE BAY FORMING A FOAMY FRINGE FROM THIS POINT TO CLAW CAPE THE BEACH WAS VERY NARROW BETWEEN THE EDGE OF THE FOREST AND THE REEFS WALKING WAS NOW MORE DIFFICULT
6153-62534-0024 AND NOT A SPOT AMONG THE ROCKS WAS LEFT UNEXAMINED
6153-62534-0025 WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN DIRECTLY OR ANY OF HER MASTS AND SPARS WOULD HAVE BEEN WASHED ON SHORE JUST AS THE CHEST HAD BEEN WHICH WAS FOUND TWENTY MILES FROM HERE BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TOWARDS THREE O'CLOCK
6153-62534-0026 HARDING AND HIS COMPANIONS ARRIVED AT A SNUG LITTLE CREEK IT FORMED QUITE A NATURAL HARBOR INVISIBLE FROM THE SEA AND WAS ENTERED BY A NARROW CHANNEL AT THE BACK OF THIS CREEK SOME VIOLENT CONVULSION HAD TORN UP THE ROCKY BORDER
6153-62534-0027 AND A CUTTING BY A GENTLE SLOPE GAVE ACCESS TO AN UPPER PLATEAU
6153-62534-0028 AND CONSEQUENTLY FOUR MILES IN A STRAIGHT LINE FROM PROSPECT HEIGHTS GIDEON SPILETT PROPOSED TO HIS COMPANIONS THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE A HALT HERE THEY AGREED READILY FOR THEIR WALK HAD SHARPENED THEIR APPETITES
6153-62534-0029 AND THOUGH THE ENGINEER SWEPT THE HORIZON WITH HIS GLASS NO VESSEL COULD BE FOUND THE SHORE WAS OF COURSE EXAMINED WITH THE SAME CARE FROM THE EDGE OF THE WATER TO THE CLIFF AND NOTHING COULD BE DISCOVERED EVEN WITH THE AID OF THE INSTRUMENT
6153-62534-0030 WELL SAID GIDEON SPILETT IT SEEMS WE MUST MAKE UP OUR MINDS TO CONSOLE OURSELVES WITH THINKING THAT NO ONE WILL COME TO DISPUTE WITH US THE POSSESSION OF LINCOLN ISLAND BUT THE BULLET CRIED HERBERT
6153-62534-0031 THAT WAS NOT IMAGINARY I SUPPOSE HANG IT NO EXCLAIMED PENCROFT THINKING OF HIS ABSENT TOOTH THEN WHAT CONCLUSION MAY BE DRAWN ASKED THE REPORTER THIS
6153-62534-0032 REPLIED THE ENGINEER THAT THREE MONTHS OR MORE AGO A VESSEL EITHER VOLUNTARILY OR NOT CAME HERE WHAT THEN YOU ADMIT CYRUS THAT SHE WAS SWALLOWED UP WITHOUT LEAVING ANY TRACE CRIED THE REPORTER
6153-62534-0033 NO MY DEAR SPILETT BUT YOU SEE THAT IF IT IS CERTAIN THAT A HUMAN BEING SET FOOT ON THE ISLAND IT APPEARS NO LESS CERTAIN THAT HE HAS NOW LEFT IT THEN IF I UNDERSTAND YOU RIGHT CAPTAIN SAID HERBERT THE VESSEL HAS LEFT AGAIN
6153-62534-0034 EVIDENTLY AND WE HAVE LOST AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET BACK TO OUR COUNTRY
6153-62534-0035 I FEAR SO VERY WELL SINCE THE OPPORTUNITY IS LOST LET US GO ON IT CAN'T BE HELPED SAID PENCROFT WHO FELT HOME SICKNESS FOR GRANITE HOUSE BUT JUST AS THEY WERE RISING TOP WAS HEARD LOUDLY BARKING
6153-62534-0036 AND THE DOG ISSUED FROM THE WOOD HOLDING IN HIS MOUTH A RAG SOILED WITH MUD
6153-62534-0037 IT WAS A PIECE OF STRONG CLOTH TOP STILL BARKED AND BY HIS GOING AND COMING SEEMED TO INVITE HIS MASTER TO FOLLOW HIM INTO THE FOREST NOW THERE'S SOMETHING TO EXPLAIN THE BULLET EXCLAIMED PENCROFT A CASTAWAY REPLIED HERBERT
6153-62534-0038 ALL RAN AFTER THE DOG AMONG THE TALL PINES ON THE BORDER OF THE FOREST HARDING AND HIS COMPANIONS MADE READY THEIR FIREARMS IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY THEY ADVANCED SOME WAY INTO THE WOOD BUT TO THEIR GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT
6153-62534-0039 THEY AS YET SAW NO SIGNS OF ANY HUMAN BEING HAVING PASSED THAT WAY SHRUBS AND CREEPERS WERE UNINJURED AND THEY HAD EVEN TO CUT THEM AWAY WITH THE AXE AS THEY HAD DONE IN THE DEEPEST RECESSES OF THE FOREST IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FANCY THAT ANY HUMAN CREATURE HAD EVER PASSED THERE
6153-62534-0040 WHO IS FOLLOWING UP AN IDEA IN ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT MINUTES TOP STOPPED IN A GLADE SURROUNDED WITH TALL TREES THE SETTLERS GAZED AROUND THEM BUT SAW NOTHING NEITHER UNDER THE BUSHES NOR AMONG THE TREES
6153-62534-0041 WHAT IS THE MATTER TOP SAID CYRUS HARDING TOP BARKED LOUDER BOUNDING ABOUT AT THE FOOT OF A GIGANTIC PINE ALL AT ONCE PENCROFT SHOUTED HO SPLENDID CAPITAL WHAT IS IT ASKED SPILETT
6153-62534-0042 I BEG YOUR PARDON RETURNED PENCROFT
6153-62534-0043 IS ALL THAT REMAINS OF OUR AIRY BOAT OF OUR BALLOON
6153-62534-0044 PENCROFT WAS NOT MISTAKEN AND HE GAVE VENT TO HIS FEELINGS IN A TREMENDOUS HURRAH ADDING THERE IS GOOD CLOTH THERE IS WHAT WILL FURNISH US WITH LINEN FOR YEARS THERE IS WHAT WILL MAKE US HANDKERCHIEFS AND SHIRTS HA HA MISTER SPILETT
6153-62534-0045 IT WAS CERTAINLY A LUCKY CIRCUMSTANCE FOR THE SETTLERS IN LINCOLN ISLAND THAT THE BALLOON AFTER HAVING MADE ITS LAST BOUND INTO THE AIR HAD FALLEN ON THE ISLAND AND THUS GIVEN THEM THE OPPORTUNITY OF FINDING IT AGAIN
6153-62534-0046 WHETHER THEY KEPT THE CASE UNDER ITS PRESENT FORM OR WHETHER THEY WISHED TO ATTEMPT ANOTHER ESCAPE BY IT OR WHETHER THEY USEFULLY EMPLOYED THE SEVERAL HUNDRED YARDS OF COTTON WHICH WAS OF FINE QUALITY
6153-62534-0047 PENCROFT'S JOY WAS THEREFORE SHARED BY ALL BUT IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRING DOWN THE REMAINS OF THE BALLOON FROM THE TREE TO PLACE IT IN SECURITY AND THIS WAS NO SLIGHT TASK
6153-62534-0048 AND THE CIRCLE AND THE ANCHOR THE CASE EXCEPT FOR THE FRACTURE WAS IN GOOD CONDITION ONLY THE LOWER PORTION BEING TORN IT WAS A FORTUNE WHICH HAD FALLEN FROM THE SKY
6153-62534-0049 ALL THE SAME CAPTAIN SAID THE SAILOR IF WE EVER DECIDE TO LEAVE THE ISLAND IT WON'T BE IN A BALLOON WILL IT THESE AIRBOATS WON'T GO WHERE WE WANT THEM TO GO AND WE HAVE HAD SOME EXPERIENCE IN THAT WAY
6153-62534-0050 LOOK HERE WE WILL BUILD A CRAFT OF SOME TWENTY TONS AND THEN WE CAN MAKE A MAIN SAIL A FORESAIL AND A JIB OUT OF THAT CLOTH AS TO THE REST OF IT THAT WILL HELP TO DRESS US WE SHALL SEE PENCROFT REPLIED CYRUS HARDING WE SHALL SEE
6153-62534-0051 IN THE MEANTIME WE MUST PUT IT IN A SAFE PLACE
6153-62534-0052 IT WAS OF IMPORTANCE THAT THIS TREASURE SHOULD NOT BE LEFT LONGER EXPOSED TO THE MERCIES OF THE FIRST STORM THE SETTLERS UNITING THEIR EFFORTS MANAGED TO DRAG IT AS FAR AS THE SHORE WHERE THEY DISCOVERED A LARGE ROCKY CAVITY
6153-62534-0053 WHICH OWING TO ITS POSITION COULD NOT BE VISITED EITHER BY THE WIND OR RAIN
6153-62534-0054 SAID PENCROFT BUT AS WE CANNOT LOCK IT UP IT WILL BE PRUDENT TO HIDE THE OPENING I DON'T MEAN FROM TWO LEGGED THIEVES BUT FROM THOSE WITH FOUR PAWS AT SIX O'CLOCK ALL WAS STOWED AWAY AND AFTER HAVING GIVEN THE CREEK THE VERY SUITABLE NAME OF PORT BALLOON
6153-62534-0055 THE SETTLERS PURSUED THEIR WAY ALONG CLAW CAPE PENCROFT AND THE ENGINEER TALKED OF THE DIFFERENT PROJECTS WHICH IT WAS AGREED TO PUT INTO EXECUTION WITH THE BRIEFEST POSSIBLE DELAY IT WAS NECESSARY FIRST OF ALL TO THROW A BRIDGE OVER THE MERCY
6153-62534-0056 SO AS TO ESTABLISH AN EASY COMMUNICATION WITH THE SOUTH OF THE ISLAND THEN THE CART MUST BE TAKEN TO BRING BACK THE BALLOON FOR THE CANOE ALONE COULD NOT CARRY IT THEN THEY WOULD BUILD A DECKED BOAT AND PENCROFT WOULD RIG IT AS A CUTTER
6153-62534-0057 AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO UNDERTAKE VOYAGES OF CIRCUMNAVIGATION ROUND THE ISLAND ET CETERA IN THE MEANWHILE NIGHT CAME ON AND IT WAS ALREADY DARK WHEN THE SETTLERS REACHED FLOTSAM POINT WHERE THEY HAD FOUND THE PRECIOUS CHEST
6153-62534-0058 AT THE FIRST ANGLE FORMED BY THE MERCY THERE THE RIVER WAS EIGHTY FEET IN BREADTH WHICH WAS AWKWARD TO CROSS BUT AS PENCROFT HAD TAKEN UPON HIMSELF TO CONQUER THIS DIFFICULTY HE WAS COMPELLED TO DO IT THE SETTLERS CERTAINLY HAD REASON TO BE PRETTY TIRED
6153-62534-0059 THEY WERE ANXIOUS TO REACH GRANITE HOUSE TO EAT AND SLEEP AND IF THE BRIDGE HAD BEEN CONSTRUCTED IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN AT HOME THE NIGHT WAS VERY DARK PENCROFT PREPARED TO KEEP HIS PROMISE BY CONSTRUCTING A SORT OF RAFT ON WHICH TO MAKE THE PASSAGE OF THE MERCY
6153-62534-0060 CHOSE TWO TREES NEAR THE WATER AND BEGAN TO ATTACK THEM AT THE BASE
6153-62534-0061 EXCLAIMED WHAT IS FLOATING THERE PENCROFT STOPPED WORKING AND SEEING AN INDISTINCT OBJECT MOVING THROUGH THE GLOOM A CANOE CRIED HE
6153-62534-0062 NO REPLY THE BOAT STILL DRIFTED ONWARD AND IT WAS NOT MORE THAN TWELVE FEET OFF WHEN THE SAILOR EXCLAIMED BUT IT IS OUR OWN BOAT SHE HAS BROKEN HER MOORINGS AND FLOATED DOWN THE CURRENT I MUST SAY SHE HAS ARRIVED VERY OPPORTUNELY
6153-62534-0063 IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO SEIZE IT BEFORE THE RAPID CURRENT SHOULD HAVE SWEPT IT AWAY OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER
6153-62534-0064 CLEVERLY MANAGED THIS BY MEANS OF A LONG POLE THE CANOE TOUCHED THE SHORE THE ENGINEER LEAPED IN FIRST AND FOUND ON EXAMINING THE ROPE THAT IT HAD BEEN REALLY WORN THROUGH BY RUBBING AGAINST THE ROCKS
6153-62534-0065 THIS IS A STRANGE THING STRANGE INDEED RETURNED CYRUS HARDING STRANGE OR NOT IT WAS VERY FORTUNATE HERBERT
6153-62534-0066 EMBARKED IN TURN THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT THE ROPE HAVING BEEN WORN THROUGH BUT THE ASTONISHING PART OF THE AFFAIR WAS THAT THE BOAT SHOULD ARRIVE JUST AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE SETTLERS WERE THERE TO SEIZE IT ON ITS WAY FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR EARLIER OR LATER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE SEA
6153-62534-0067 IF THEY HAD BEEN LIVING IN THE TIME OF GENII THIS INCIDENT WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM THE RIGHT TO THINK THAT THE ISLAND WAS HAUNTED BY SOME SUPERNATURAL BEING WHO USED HIS POWER IN THE SERVICE OF THE CASTAWAYS
