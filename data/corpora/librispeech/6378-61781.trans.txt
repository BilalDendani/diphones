6378-61781-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTY SEVEN ANOTHER LINK IT WAS LESS SURPRISE THAN GRATIFICATION THAT SHOWED ITSELF ON THE COUNTENANCE OF ZEB STUMP AS HE DECIPHERED THE WRITING ON THE PAPER THAT ERE'S THE BACKIN O A LETTER MUTTERED HE TELLS A GOODISH GRIST O STORY

6378-61781-0002 I'STEAD O THE PROPER AN BESSEST THING WHICH AIR A BIT O GREASED BUCKSKIN THE WRITIN AIR IN A SHEEMALE HAND HE CONTINUED LOOKING ANEW AT THE PIECE OF PAPER
6378-61781-0003 IT'S BEEN SENT TO HIM ALL THE SAME AN HE'S HED IT IN PURZESHUN IT AIR SOMETHIN TO BE TUK CARE O SO SAYING HE DREW OUT A SMALL SKIN WALLET WHICH CONTAINED HIS TINDER OF PUNK ALONG WITH HIS FLINT AND STEEL AND AFTER CAREFULLY STOWING AWAY THE SCRAP OF PAPER HE RETURNED THE SACK TO HIS POCKET
6378-61781-0004 I KALKERLATE AS HOW THIS OLE COON LL BE ABLE TO UNWIND A GOOD GRIST O THIS CLUE O MYSTERY THO THUR BE A BIT O THE THREAD BROKEN HYUR AN THUR AN A BIT O A PUZZLE I CAN'T CLURLY UNDERSTAN THE MAN WHO HEV BEEN MURDERED WHOSOMDIVER HE MAY BE WAR OUT THUR BY THET PUDDLE O BLOOD
6378-61781-0005 AN THE MAN AS DID THE DEED WHOSOMDIVER HE BE WAR A STANNIN BEHINT THIS LOCUST TREE BUT FOR THEM GREENHORNS I MOUT A GOT MORE OUT O THE SIGN NOW THUR AIN'T THE GHOST O A CHANCE
6378-61781-0006 THE BESSEST THING NOW AIR TO TAKE THE BACK TRACK IF IT AIR POSSABLE AN DISKIVER WHAR THE HOSS WI THE BROKE SHOE TOTED HIS RIDER ARTER HE WENT BACK FROM THIS LEETLE BIT O STILL HUNTIN
6378-61781-0007 BACK YE GO ON THE BOOT TRACKS WITH THIS GROTESQUE APOSTROPHE TO HIMSELF HE COMMENCED RETRACING THE FOOTMARKS THAT HAD GUIDED HIM TO THE EDGE OF THE OPENING ONLY IN ONE OR TWO PLACES WERE THE FOOTPRINTS AT ALL DISTINCT
6378-61781-0008 HAVING ALREADY NOTED THAT THE MAN WHO MADE THEM HAD RETURNED TO THE PLACE WHERE THE HORSE HAD BEEN LEFT HE KNEW THE BACK TRACK WOULD LEAD HIM THERE THERE WAS ONE PLACE HOWEVER WHERE THE TWO TRAILS DID NOT GO OVER THE SAME GROUND THERE WAS A FORKING IN THE OPEN LIST THROUGH WHICH THE SUPPOSED MURDERER HAD MADE HIS WAY
6378-61781-0009 IT WAS CAUSED BY AN OBSTRUCTION A PATCH OF IMPENETRABLE THICKET THEY MET AGAIN BUT NOT TILL THAT ON WHICH THE HUNTER WAS RETURNING STRAGGLED OFF INTO AN OPEN GLADE OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE HAVING BECOME SATISFIED OF THIS ZEB LOOKED AROUND INTO THE GLADE
6378-61781-0010 FOR A TIME FORSAKING THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE PEDESTRIAN AFTER A SHORT EXAMINATION HE OBSERVED A TRAIL ALTOGETHER DISTINCT AND OF A DIFFERENT CHARACTER IT WAS A WELL MARKED PATH ENTERING THE OPENING ON ONE SIDE AND GOING OUT ON THE OTHER IN SHORT A CATTLE TRACK
6378-61781-0011 ZEB SAW THAT SEVERAL SHOD HORSES HAD PASSED ALONG IT SOME DAYS BEFORE AND IT WAS THIS THAT CAUSED HIM TO COME BACK AND EXAMINE IT HE COULD TELL TO A DAY TO AN HOUR WHEN THE HORSES HAD PASSED AND FROM THE SIGN ITSELF
6378-61781-0012 BUT THE EXERCISE OF HIS INGENUITY WAS NOT NEEDED ON THIS OCCASION HE KNEW THAT THE HOOF PRINTS WERE THOSE OF THE HORSES RIDDEN BY SPANGLER AND HIS PARTY AFTER BEING DETACHED FROM THE MAIN BODY OF SEARCHERS WHO HAD GONE HOME WITH THE MAJOR HE HAD HEARD THE WHOLE STORY OF THAT COLLATERAL INVESTIGATION
6378-61781-0013 HOW SPANGLER AND HIS COMRADES HAD TRACED HENRY POINDEXTER'S HORSE TO THE PLACE WHERE THE NEGRO HAD CAUGHT IT ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE PLANTATION TO AN ORDINARY INTELLECT THIS MIGHT HAVE APPEARED SATISFACTORY NOTHING MORE COULD BE LEARNT BY ANY ONE GOING OVER THE GROUND AGAIN
6378-61781-0014 ZEB STUMP DID NOT SEEM TO THINK SO AS HE STOOD LOOKING ALONG IT HIS ATTITUDE SHOWED INDECISION IF I KED MAKE SHUR O HAVIN TIME HE MUTTERED I'D FOLLER IT FUST JEST AS LIKE AS NOT I'LL FIND A FLUKE THUR TOO
6378-61781-0015 HE HAD TURNED TO GO OUT OF THE GLADE WHEN A THOUGHT ONCE MORE STAYED HIM
6378-61781-0016 I KIN GUESS WHAR IT'LL LEAD AS SARTINT AS IF I'D RUD LONGSIDE THE SKUNK THET MADE IT STRAIGHT CUSTRUT TO THE STABLE O CASER CORVER IT'S A DURNED PITY TO DROP THIS UN NOW WHILES I'M HYUR UPON THE SPOT IT'LL GIE ME THE MAKIN O ANOTHER TEN MILE JURNEY
6378-61781-0017 DOG GONED EF I DON'T TRY A LEETLE WAY ALONG IT THE OLE MAAR KIN WAIT TILL I KUM BACK BRACING HIMSELF FOR A NEW INVESTIGATION HE STARTED OFF UPON THE CATTLE TRACK TRODDEN BY THE HORSES OF SPANGLER AND HIS PARTY TO THE HOOF MARKS OF THESE HE PAID BUT SLIGHT ATTENTION
6378-61781-0018 AT TIMES NONE WHATEVER HIS EYE ONLY SOUGHT THOSE OF HENRY POINDEXTER'S HORSE THOUGH THE OTHERS WERE OF AN AFTER TIME AND OFTEN DESTROYED THE TRACES HE WAS MOST ANXIOUS TO EXAMINE HE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN IDENTIFYING THE LATTER AS HE WOULD HAVE HIMSELF SAID
6378-61781-0019 ANY GREENHORN COULD DO THAT THE YOUNG PLANTER'S HORSE HAD GONE OVER THE GROUND AT A GALLOP THE TRACKERS HAD RIDDEN SLOWLY
6378-61781-0020 IT WAS ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE FROM THE EDGE OF THE VENUE IT WAS NOT A HALT THE GALLOPING HORSE HAD MADE BUT ONLY A SLIGHT DEPARTURE FROM HIS DIRECT COURSE AS IF SOMETHING HE HAD SEEN WOLF JAGUAR COUGAR OR OTHER BEAST OF PREY HAD CAUSED HIM TO SHY
6378-61781-0021 BEYOND HE HAD CONTINUED HIS CAREER RAPID AND RECKLESS AS EVER BEYOND THE PARTY ALONG WITH SPANGLER HAD PROCEEDED WITHOUT STAYING TO INQUIRE WHY THE HORSE HAD SHIED FROM HIS TRACK ZEB STUMP WAS MORE INQUISITIVE AND PAUSED UPON THIS SPOT
6378-61781-0022 IT WAS A STERILE TRACT WITHOUT HERBAGE AND COVERED WITH SHINGLE AND SAND A HUGE TREE OVERSHADOWED IT WITH LIMBS EXTENDING HORIZONTALLY ONE OF THESE RAN TRANSVERSELY TO THE PATH OVER WHICH THE HORSES HAD PASSED SO LOW THAT A HORSEMAN TO SHUN CONTACT WITH IT WOULD HAVE TO LOWER HIS HEAD
6378-61781-0023 HE OBSERVED AN ABRASION UPON THE BARK THAT THOUGH VERY SLIGHT MUST HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY CONTACT WITH SOME SUBSTANCE AS HARD IF NOT SOUNDER THAN ITSELF THET'S BEEN DONE BY THE SKULL O A HUMAN CRITTER REASONED HE A HUMAN CRITTER THAT MUST A BEEN ON THE BACK O A HOSS
6378-61781-0024 HOORAW HE TRIUMPHANTLY EXCLAIMED AFTER A CURSORY EXAMINATION OF THE GROUND UNDERNEATH THE TREE I THORT SO THUR'S THE IMPRESHUN O THE THROWED RIDER AN THUR'S WHAR HE HEZ CREEPED AWAY NOW I'VE GOT A EXPLICATION O THET BIG BUMP AS HEZ BEEN PUZZLIN ME
6378-61781-0025 I KNOW'D IT WAN'T DID BY THE CLAWS O ANY VARMINT AN IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THE BLOW EYTHER O A STONE OR A STICK
6378-61781-0026 WITH AN ELASTIC STEP HIS COUNTENANCE RADIANT OF TRIUMPH THE OLD HUNTER STRODE AWAY FROM THE TREE NO LONGER UPON THE CATTLE PATH BUT THAT TAKEN BY THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN SO VIOLENTLY DISMOUNTED TO ONE UNACCUSTOMED TO THE CHAPPARAL HE MIGHT HAVE APPEARED GOING WITHOUT A GUIDE
6378-61781-0027 AND UPON A PATH NEVER BEFORE PRESSED BY HUMAN FOOT A PORTION OF IT PERHAPS HAD NOT
6378-61781-0028 WERE TO HIM INTELLIGIBLE AS THE PAINTED LETTERING UPON A FINGER POST THE BRANCH CONTORTED TO AFFORD PASSAGE FOR A HUMAN FORM THE DISPLACED TENDRILS OF A CREEPING PLANT THE SCRATCHED SURFACE OF THE EARTH ALL TOLD THAT A MAN HAD PASSED THAT WAY THE SIGN SIGNIFIED MORE
6378-61781-0029 THAT THE MAN WAS DISABLED HAD BEEN CRAWLING A CRIPPLE ZEB STUMP CONTINUED ON TILL HE HAD TRACED THIS CRIPPLE TO THE BANKS OF A RUNNING STREAM
