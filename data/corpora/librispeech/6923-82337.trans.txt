6923-82337-0000 VIRTUE ORDERED OUTSIDE A HOMELY ENGLISH ROW WHEN I SAY I WAS AWAKENED AT OSTEND I DO NOT SPEAK THE STRICT TRUTH I WAS NOT AWAKENED NOT PROPERLY
6923-82337-0001 I WAS ONLY HALF AWAKENED I NEVER DID GET FAIRLY AWAKE UNTIL THE AFTERNOON DURING THE JOURNEY FROM OSTEND TO COLOGNE I WAS THREE PARTS ASLEEP AND ONE PART PARTIALLY AWAKE AT OSTEND HOWEVER
6923-82337-0002 I WAS SUFFICIENTLY AROUSED TO GRASP THE IDEA THAT WE HAD GOT SOMEWHERE AND THAT I MUST FIND MY LUGGAGE AND B AND DO SOMETHING OR OTHER IN ADDITION TO WHICH A STRANGE VAGUE INSTINCT BUT ONE WHICH I HAVE NEVER YET KNOWN DECEIVE ME HOVERING ABOUT MY MIND
6923-82337-0003 AND TELLING ME THAT I WAS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF SOMETHING TO EAT AND DRINK SPURRED ME TO VIGOUR AND ACTION I HURRIED DOWN INTO THE SALOON AND THERE FOUND B HE EXCUSED HIMSELF FOR HAVING LEFT ME ALONE ALL NIGHT HE NEED NOT HAVE TROUBLED HIMSELF
6923-82337-0004 I HAD NOT PINED FOR HIM IN THE LEAST IF THE ONLY WOMAN I HAD EVER LOVED HAD BEEN ON BOARD I SHOULD HAVE SAT SILENT AND LET ANY OTHER FELLOW TALK TO HER THAT WANTED TO AND THAT FELT EQUAL TO IT BY EXPLAINING THAT HE HAD MET A FRIEND AND THAT THEY HAD BEEN TALKING
6923-82337-0005 IT APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN A TRYING CONVERSATION I ALSO RAN AGAINST THE TALKATIVE MAN AND HIS COMPANION SUCH A COMPLETE WRECK OF A ONCE STRONG MAN AS THE LATTER LOOKED I HAVE NEVER BEFORE SEEN MERE SEA SICKNESS HOWEVER SEVERE
6923-82337-0006 COULD NEVER HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR THE CHANGE IN HIS APPEARANCE SINCE HAPPY AND HOPEFUL HE ENTERED THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE AT VICTORIA SIX SHORT HOURS AGO HIS FRIEND ON THE OTHER HAND APPEARED FRESH AND CHEERFUL AND WAS RELATING AN ANECDOTE ABOUT A COW
6923-82337-0007 WE TOOK OUR BAGS INTO THE CUSTOM HOUSE AND OPENED THEM AND I SAT DOWN ON MINE AND IMMEDIATELY WENT TO SLEEP WHEN I AWOKE SOMEBODY WHOM I MISTOOK AT FIRST FOR A FIELD MARSHAL AND FROM FORCE OF HABIT
6923-82337-0008 I WAS ONCE A VOLUNTEER SALUTED WAS STANDING OVER ME POINTING MELODRAMATICALLY AT MY BAG I ASSURED HIM IN PICTURESQUE GERMAN THAT I HAD NOTHING TO DECLARE HE DID NOT APPEAR TO COMPREHEND ME
6923-82337-0009 WHICH STRUCK ME AS CURIOUS AND TOOK THE BAG AWAY FROM ME WHICH LEFT ME NOTHING TO SIT UPON BUT THE FLOOR BUT I FELT TOO SLEEPY TO BE INDIGNANT AFTER OUR LUGGAGE HAD BEEN EXAMINED WE WENT INTO THE BUFFET
6923-82337-0010 MY INSTINCT HAD NOT MISLED ME THERE I FOUND HOT COFFEE AND ROLLS AND BUTTER I ORDERED TWO COFFEES WITH MILK SOME BREAD AND SOME BUTTER I ORDERED THEM IN THE BEST GERMAN I KNEW AS NOBODY UNDERSTOOD ME
6923-82337-0011 I WENT AND GOT THE THINGS FOR MYSELF IT SAVES A DEAL OF ARGUMENT THAT METHOD PEOPLE SEEM TO KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN IN A MOMENT THEN B SUGGESTED THAT WHILE WE WERE IN BELGIUM WHERE EVERYBODY SPOKE FRENCH WHILE VERY FEW INDEED KNEW GERMAN
6923-82337-0012 I SHOULD STAND A BETTER CHANCE OF BEING UNDERSTOOD IF I TALKED LESS GERMAN AND MORE FRENCH HE SAID IT WILL BE EASIER FOR YOU AND LESS OF A STRAIN UPON THE NATIVES YOU STICK TO FRENCH HE CONTINUED AS LONG AS EVER YOU CAN
6923-82337-0013 YOU WILL GET ALONG MUCH BETTER WITH FRENCH YOU WILL COME ACROSS PEOPLE NOW AND THEN SMART INTELLIGENT PEOPLE WHO WILL PARTIALLY UNDERSTAND YOUR FRENCH BUT NO HUMAN BEING EXCEPT A THOUGHT READER WILL EVER OBTAIN ANY GLIMMERING OF WHAT YOU MEAN FROM YOUR GERMAN
6923-82337-0014 I THOUGHT WE WERE IN GERMANY I DIDN'T KNOW AND THEN IN A BURST OF CONFIDENCE I ADDED FEELING THAT FURTHER DECEIT WAS USELESS I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM YOU KNOW NO I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T HE REPLIED
6923-82337-0015 THAT IS EXACTLY THE IDEA YOU GIVE ANYBODY I WISH YOU'D WAKE UP A BIT WE WAITED ABOUT AN HOUR AT OSTEND WHILE OUR TRAIN WAS MADE UP THERE WAS ONLY ONE CARRIAGE LABELLED FOR COLOGNE AND FOUR MORE PASSENGERS WANTED TO GO THERE
6923-82337-0016 THAN THE COMPARTMENT WOULD HOLD NOT BEING AWARE OF THIS B AND I MADE NO HASTE TO SECURE PLACES AND IN CONSEQUENCE WHEN HAVING FINISHED OUR COFFEE WE LEISURELY STROLLED UP AND OPENED THE CARRIAGE DOOR WE SAW THAT EVERY SEAT WAS ALREADY BOOKED
6923-82337-0017 A BAG WAS IN ONE SPACE AND A RUG IN ANOTHER AN UMBRELLA BOOKED A THIRD AND SO ON NOBODY WAS THERE BUT THE SEATS WERE GONE IT IS THE UNWRITTEN LAW AMONG TRAVELLERS THAT A MAN'S LUGGAGE DEPOSITED UPON A SEAT
6923-82337-0018 SHALL SECURE THAT SEAT TO HIM UNTIL HE COMES TO SIT UPON IT HIMSELF THIS IS A GOOD LAW AND A JUST LAW AND ONE THAT IN MY NORMAL STATE I MYSELF WOULD DIE TO UPHOLD AND MAINTAIN BUT AT THREE O'CLOCK ON A CHILLY MORNING
6923-82337-0019 ONE'S MORAL SENSIBILITIES ARE NOT PROPERLY DEVELOPED THE AVERAGE MAN'S CONSCIENCE DOES NOT BEGIN WORK TILL EIGHT OR NINE O'CLOCK NOT TILL AFTER BREAKFAST IN FACT AT THREE A M HE WILL DO THINGS THAT AT THREE IN THE AFTERNOON HIS SOUL WOULD REVOLT AT
6923-82337-0020 UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES I SHOULD AS SOON HAVE THOUGHT OF SHIFTING A MAN'S BAG AND APPROPRIATING HIS SEAT AS AN ANCIENT HEBREW SQUATTER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF REMOVING HIS NEIGHBOUR'S LANDMARK BUT AT THIS TIME IN THE MORNING MY BETTER NATURE WAS ASLEEP
6923-82337-0021 I HAVE OFTEN READ OF A MAN'S BETTER NATURE BEING SUDDENLY AWAKENED THE BUSINESS IS GENERALLY ACCOMPLISHED BY AN ORGAN GRINDER OR A LITTLE CHILD I WOULD BACK THE LATTER AT ALL EVENTS GIVE IT A FAIR CHANCE TO AWAKEN ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD THAT WAS NOT STONE DEAF
6923-82337-0022 OR THAT HAD NOT BEEN DEAD FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND IF AN ORGAN GRINDER OR A LITTLE CHILD HAD BEEN AROUND OSTEND STATION THAT MORNING THINGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT B AND I MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAVED FROM CRIME JUST AS WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR VILLAINY
6923-82337-0023 AND HAVE FALLEN UPON EACH OTHER'S NECKS OUTSIDE ON THE PLATFORM AND HAVE WEPT AND WAITED FOR THE NEXT TRAIN AS IT WAS AFTER LOOKING CAREFULLY ROUND TO SEE THAT NOBODY WAS WATCHING US WE SLIPPED QUICKLY INTO THE CARRIAGE
6923-82337-0024 AND MAKING ROOM FOR OURSELVES AMONG THE LUGGAGE THERE SAT DOWN AND TRIED TO LOOK INNOCENT AND EASY B SAID THAT THE BEST THING WE COULD DO WHEN THE OTHER PEOPLE CAME WOULD BE TO PRETEND TO BE DEAD ASLEEP AND TOO STUPID TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING
6923-82337-0025 I REPLIED THAT AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED I THOUGHT I COULD CONVEY THE DESIRED IMPRESSION WITHOUT STOOPING TO DECEIT AT ALL AND PREPARED TO MAKE MYSELF COMFORTABLE A FEW SECONDS LATER ANOTHER MAN GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE
6923-82337-0026 HE ALSO MADE ROOM FOR HIMSELF AMONG THE LUGGAGE AND SAT DOWN I AM AFRAID THAT SEAT'S TAKEN SIR SAID B WHEN HE HAD RECOVERED HIS SURPRISE AT THE MAN'S COOLNESS IN FACT ALL THE SEATS IN THIS CARRIAGE ARE TAKEN I CAN'T HELP THAT REPLIED THE RUFFIAN CYNICALLY
6923-82337-0027 I'VE GOT TO GET TO COLOGNE SOME TIME TO DAY AND THERE SEEMS NO OTHER WAY OF DOING IT THAT I CAN SEE
6923-82337-0028 YOU ARE THINKING ONLY OF YOURSELF MY SENSE OF RIGHT AND JUSTICE WAS BEGINNING TO ASSERT ITSELF AND I FELT QUITE INDIGNANT WITH THE FELLOW TWO MINUTES AGO AS I HAVE EXPLAINED I COULD CONTEMPLATE THE TAKING OF ANOTHER MAN'S SEAT WITH EQUANIMITY
6923-82337-0029 NOW SUCH AN ACT SEEMED TO ME SHAMEFUL THE TRUTH IS THAT MY BETTER NATURE NEVER SLEEPS FOR LONG LEAVE IT ALONE AND IT WAKENS OF ITS OWN ACCORD HEAVEN HELP ME I AM A SINFUL WORLDLY MAN I KNOW BUT THERE IS GOOD AT THE BOTTOM OF ME
6923-82337-0030 IT WANTS HAULING UP BUT IT'S THERE THIS MAN HAD AROUSED IT I NOW SAW THE SINFULNESS OF TAKING ANOTHER PASSENGER'S PLACE IN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE BUT I COULD NOT MAKE THE OTHER MAN SEE IT I FELT THAT SOME SERVICE WAS DUE FROM ME TO JUSTICE
6923-82337-0031 IN COMPENSATION OF THE WRONG I HAD DONE HER A FEW MOMENTS AGO AND I ARGUED MOST ELOQUENTLY MY RHETORIC WAS HOWEVER QUITE THROWN AWAY OH IT'S ONLY A VICE CONSUL HE SAID HERE'S HIS NAME ON THE BAG THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FOR HIM IN WITH THE GUARD
6923-82337-0032 IT WAS NO USE MY DEFENDING THE SACRED CAUSE OF RIGHT BEFORE A MAN WHO HELD SENTIMENTS LIKE THAT SO HAVING LODGED A PROTEST AGAINST HIS BEHAVIOUR AND THUS EASED MY CONSCIENCE I LEANT BACK AND DOZED THE DOZE OF THE JUST
6923-82337-0033 FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE TRAIN STARTED THE RIGHTFUL OWNERS OF THE CARRIAGE CAME UP AND CROWDED IN THEY SEEMED SURPRISED AT FINDING ONLY FIVE VACANT SEATS AVAILABLE BETWEEN SEVEN OF THEM AND COMMENCED TO QUARREL VIGOROUSLY AMONG THEMSELVES B AND I
6923-82337-0034 AND THE UNJUST MAN IN THE CORNER TRIED TO CALM THEM BUT PASSION RAN TOO HIGH AT FIRST FOR THE VOICE OF REASON TO BE HEARD EACH COMBINATION OF FIVE POSSIBLE AMONG THEM ACCUSED EACH REMAINING TWO OF ENDEAVOURING TO OBTAIN SEATS BY FRAUD
6923-82337-0035 AND EACH ONE MORE THAN HINTED THAT THE OTHER SIX WERE LIARS WHAT ANNOYED ME WAS THAT THEY QUARRELLED IN ENGLISH THEY ALL HAD LANGUAGES OF THEIR OWN THERE WERE FOUR BELGIANS TWO FRENCHMEN AND A GERMAN
6923-82337-0036 FINDING THAT THERE SEEMED TO BE NO CHANCE OF THEIR EVER AGREEING AMONG THEMSELVES THEY APPEALED TO US WE UNHESITATINGLY DECIDED IN FAVOUR OF THE FIVE THINNEST WHO THEREUPON EVIDENTLY REGARDING THE MATTER AS FINALLY SETTLED
6923-82337-0037 SAT DOWN AND TOLD THE OTHER TWO TO GET OUT THESE TWO STOUT ONES HOWEVER THE GERMAN AND ONE OF THE BELGIANS SEEMED INCLINED TO DISPUTE THE AWARD AND CALLED UP THE STATION MASTER THE STATION MASTER DID NOT WAIT TO LISTEN TO WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY
6923-82337-0038 HE TOLD THEM THEY OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR FORCING THEIR WAY INTO A COMPARTMENT THAT WAS ALREADY MORE THAN FULL AND INCONVENIENCING THE PEOPLE ALREADY THERE HE ALSO USED ENGLISH TO EXPLAIN THIS TO THEM AND THEY GOT OUT ON THE PLATFORM AND ANSWERED HIM BACK IN ENGLISH
6923-82337-0039 ENGLISH SEEMS TO BE THE POPULAR LANGUAGE FOR QUARRELLING IN AMONG FOREIGNERS I SUPPOSE THEY FIND IT MORE EXPRESSIVE WE ALL WATCHED THE GROUP FROM THE WINDOW WE WERE AMUSED AND INTERESTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ARGUMENT
6923-82337-0040 AN EARLY GENDARME ARRIVED ON THE SCENE THE GENDARME NATURALLY SUPPORTED THE STATION MASTER ONE MAN IN UNIFORM ALWAYS SUPPORTS ANOTHER MAN IN UNIFORM NO MATTER WHAT THE ROW IS ABOUT OR WHO MAY BE IN THE RIGHT THAT DOES NOT TROUBLE HIM
6923-82337-0041 IT IS A FIXED TENET OF BELIEF AMONG UNIFORM CIRCLES THAT A UNIFORM CAN DO NO WRONG IF BURGLARS WORE UNIFORM THE POLICE WOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO RENDER THEM EVERY ASSISTANCE IN THEIR POWER AND TO TAKE INTO CUSTODY
6923-82337-0042 ANY HOUSEHOLDER ATTEMPTING TO INTERFERE WITH THEM IN THE EXECUTION OF THEIR BUSINESS THE GENDARME ASSISTED THE STATION MASTER TO ABUSE THE TWO STOUT PASSENGERS AND HE ALSO ABUSED THEM IN ENGLISH IT WAS NOT GOOD ENGLISH IN ANY SENSE OF THE WORD
6923-82337-0043 THE MAN WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GIVE HIS FEELINGS MUCH GREATER VARIETY AND PLAY IN FRENCH OR FLEMISH BUT THAT WAS NOT HIS OBJECT HIS AMBITION LIKE EVERY OTHER FOREIGNER'S WAS TO BECOME AN ACCOMPLISHED ENGLISH QUARRELLER AND THIS WAS PRACTICE FOR HIM
6923-82337-0044 A CUSTOMS HOUSE CLERK CAME OUT AND JOINED IN THE BABEL HE TOOK THE PART OF THE PASSENGERS AND ABUSED THE STATION MASTER AND THE GENDARME AND HE ABUSED THEM IN ENGLISH
