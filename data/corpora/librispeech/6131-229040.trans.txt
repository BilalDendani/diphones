6131-229040-0001 A SALLOW MAN WITH A HOPELESS LOOK IN HIS HEAVY EYES ROSE SLOWLY IN HIS SEAT AND STOOD FACING THE JUDGE THERE WAS A PAUSE IN THE HUM AND BUSTLE OF THE COURT AS MEN TURNED TO WATCH THE PRISONER HE DID NOT LOOK LIKE A MAN WHO WOULD TAKE A NEIGHBOR'S LIFE
6131-229040-0002 AND YET SO NEARLY HAD HE DONE SO OF SET PURPOSE IT HAD BEEN ABUNDANTLY PROVED THAT HIS VICTIM WOULD CARRY THE DISFIGURING SCAR OF THE BULLET TO THE END OF HIS LIFE AND ONLY BY WHAT SEEMED AN ALMOST MIRACULOUS CHANCE HAD ESCAPED DEATH
6131-229040-0003 THE STORY AS TOLD BY WITNESSES AND SUBSTANTIALLY UNCONTRADICTED WAS THIS PORTOGHESE AND VITO AMMELLA WHOM HE SHOT WERE NEIGHBORS UNDER THE SAME ROOF AMMELLA KEPT THE GROCERY ON THE GROUND FLOOR
6131-229040-0004 PORTOGHESE LIVED UPSTAIRS IN THE TENEMENT HE WAS A PROSPEROUS PEACEFUL MAN WITH A FAMILY OF BRIGHT CHILDREN WITH WHOM HE ROMPED AND PLAYED HAPPILY WHEN HOME FROM HIS BARBER SHOP
6131-229040-0005 THE BLACK HAND FIXED ITS EVIL EYE UPON THE FAMILY GROUP AND SAW ITS CHANCE ONE DAY A LETTER CAME DEMANDING A THOUSAND DOLLARS PORTOGHESE PUT IT ASIDE WITH THE COMMENT THAT THIS WAS NEW YORK NOT ITALY
6131-229040-0006 OTHER LETTERS FOLLOWED THREATENING HARM TO HIS CHILDREN PORTOGHESE PAID NO ATTENTION BUT HIS WIFE WORRIED ONE DAY THE BABY LITTLE VITO WAS MISSING AND IN HYSTERICS SHE RAN TO HER HUSBAND'S SHOP
6131-229040-0007 CRYING THAT THE BLACK HAND HAD STOLEN THE CHILD THE BARBER HURRIED HOME AND SOUGHT HIGH AND LOW AT LAST HE CAME UPON THE CHILD SITTING ON AMMELLA'S DOORSTEP HE HAD WANDERED AWAY AND BROUGHT UP AT THE GROCERY ASKED WHERE HE HAD BEEN
