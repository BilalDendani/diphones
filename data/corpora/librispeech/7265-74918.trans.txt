7265-74918-0000 AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER IT WAS VERY SOON AFTER THIS THAT I FIRST BEGAN TO HAVE THE PAIN IN MY HIP WHICH HAS ENDED IN MAKING ME A CRIPPLE FOR LIFE I HARDLY RECOLLECT MORE THAN ONE WALK AFTER OUR RETURN UNDER MISTER GRAY'S ESCORT FROM MISTER LATHOM'S
7265-74918-0001 INDEED AT THE TIME I WAS NOT WITHOUT SUSPICIONS WHICH I NEVER NAMED THAT THE BEGINNING OF ALL THE MISCHIEF WAS A GREAT JUMP I HAD TAKEN FROM THE TOP OF ONE OF THE STILES ON THAT VERY OCCASION WELL IT IS A LONG WHILE AGO AND GOD DISPOSES OF US ALL
7265-74918-0002 AND I AM NOT GOING TO TIRE YOU OUT WITH TELLING YOU HOW I THOUGHT AND FELT AND HOW WHEN I SAW WHAT MY LIFE WAS TO BE I COULD HARDLY BRING MYSELF TO BE PATIENT BUT RATHER WISHED TO DIE AT ONCE
7265-74918-0003 MISSUS MEDLICOTT WAS GREAT AS A NURSE AND I AM SURE I CAN NEVER BE GRATEFUL ENOUGH TO HER MEMORY FOR ALL HER KINDNESS BUT SHE WAS PUZZLED TO KNOW HOW TO MANAGE ME IN OTHER WAYS I USED TO HAVE LONG HARD FITS OF CRYING
7265-74918-0004 AND THINKING THAT I OUGHT TO GO HOME AND YET WHAT COULD THEY DO WITH ME THERE AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY OTHER ANXIOUS THOUGHTS SOME OF WHICH I COULD TELL TO MISSUS MEDLICOTT AND OTHERS I COULD NOT HER WAY OF COMFORTING ME WAS HURRYING AWAY FOR SOME KIND OF TEMPTING OR STRENGTHENING FOOD
7265-74918-0005 THERE TAKE IT DEAR TAKE IT SHE WOULD SAY
7265-74918-0006 BUT I THINK SHE GOT PUZZLED AT LENGTH AT THE NON EFFICACY OF GOOD THINGS TO EAT AND ONE DAY AFTER I HAD LIMPED DOWN TO SEE THE DOCTOR IN MISSUS MEDLICOTT'S SITTING ROOM A ROOM LINED WITH CUPBOARDS CONTAINING PRESERVES AND DAINTIES OF ALL KINDS WHICH SHE PERPETUALLY MADE AND NEVER TOUCHED HERSELF
7265-74918-0007 WHEN I WAS RETURNING TO MY BED ROOM TO CRY AWAY THE AFTERNOON UNDER PRETENCE OF ARRANGING MY CLOTHES JOHN FOOTMAN BROUGHT ME A MESSAGE FROM MY LADY WITH WHOM THE DOCTOR HAD BEEN HAVING A CONVERSATION TO BID ME GO TO HER IN THAT PRIVATE SITTING ROOM AT THE END OF THE SUITE OF APARTMENTS
7265-74918-0008 ABOUT WHICH I SPOKE IN DESCRIBING THE DAY OF MY FIRST ARRIVAL AT HANBURY I HAD HARDLY BEEN IN IT SINCE AS WHEN WE READ TO MY LADY SHE GENERALLY SAT IN THE SMALL WITHDRAWING ROOM OUT OF WHICH THIS PRIVATE ROOM OF HERS OPENED
7265-74918-0009 I MEAN PRIVACY I DO NOT THINK THAT THERE WAS A ROOM WHICH MY LADY OCCUPIED THAT HAD NOT TWO DOORS AND SOME OF THEM HAD THREE OR FOUR
7265-74918-0010 AND IT WAS MISSUS MEDLICOTT'S DUTY TO SIT WITHIN CALL AS IT WERE IN A SORT OF ANTEROOM THAT LED OUT OF MY LADY'S OWN SITTING ROOM ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE TO THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR
7265-74918-0011 BEYOND WHICH LAY THE FARM BUILDINGS AND OFFICES SO THAT PEOPLE COULD COME IN THIS WAY TO MY LADY ON BUSINESS WHILE IF SHE WERE GOING INTO THE GARDEN FROM HER OWN ROOM SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO PASS THROUGH MISSUS MEDLICOTT'S APARTMENT OUT INTO THE LESSER HALL
7265-74918-0012 AND THEN TURNING TO THE RIGHT AS SHE PASSED ON TO THE TERRACE SHE COULD GO DOWN THE FLIGHT OF BROAD SHALLOW STEPS AT THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE INTO THE LOVELY GARDEN WITH STRETCHING SWEEPING LAWNS AND GAY FLOWER BEDS AND BEAUTIFUL BOSSY LAURELS AND OTHER BLOOMING OR MASSY SHRUBS
7265-74918-0013 WITH FULL GROWN BEECHES OR LARCHES FEATHERING DOWN TO THE GROUND A LITTLE FARTHER OFF THE WHOLE WAS SET IN A FRAME AS IT WERE BY THE MORE DISTANT WOODLANDS THE HOUSE HAD BEEN MODERNIZED IN THE DAYS OF QUEEN ANNE I THINK
7265-74918-0014 SO IT WAS ONLY THE SUITE OF WITHDRAWING ROOMS AND THE TERRACE ROOMS AS FAR AS THE PRIVATE ENTRANCE THAT HAD THE NEW LONG HIGH WINDOWS PUT IN AND THESE WERE OLD ENOUGH BY THIS TIME TO BE DRAPED WITH ROSES AND HONEYSUCKLES AND PYRACANTHUS WINTER AND SUMMER LONG
7265-74918-0015 WELL TO GO BACK TO THAT DAY WHEN I LIMPED INTO MY LADY'S SITTING ROOM TRYING HARD TO LOOK AS IF I HAD NOT BEEN CRYING AND NOT TO WALK AS IF I WAS IN MUCH PAIN I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER MY LADY SAW HOW NEAR MY TEARS WERE TO MY EYES
7265-74918-0016 BUT ALTHOUGH I FOUND ONE THERE A MORNING OR TWO AFTERWARDS WHEN I CAME DOWN
7265-74918-0017 I TRIED IT ONE DAY SOME TIME AFTERWARDS WHEN MY LADY WAS OUT OF THE ROOM AND I HAD A FANCY FOR SEEING HOW I COULD MOVE ABOUT AND VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IT WAS NOW MY CHAIR AS I LEARNT TO CALL IT AND TO THINK IT WAS SOFT AND LUXURIOUS
7265-74918-0018 AND SEEMED SOMEHOW TO GIVE ONE'S BODY REST JUST IN THAT PART WHERE ONE MOST NEEDED IT I WAS NOT AT MY EASE THAT FIRST DAY NOR INDEED FOR MANY DAYS AFTERWARDS NOTWITHSTANDING MY CHAIR WAS SO COMFORTABLE
7265-74918-0019 YET I FORGOT MY SAD PAIN IN SILENTLY WONDERING OVER THE MEANING OF MANY OF THE THINGS WE TURNED OUT OF THOSE CURIOUS OLD DRAWERS I WAS PUZZLED TO KNOW WHY SOME WERE KEPT AT ALL A SCRAP OF WRITING MAYBE WITH ONLY HALF A DOZEN COMMON PLACE WORDS WRITTEN ON IT OR A BIT OF BROKEN RIDING WHIP
7265-74918-0020 BUT IT SEEMS THAT WAS JUST MY IGNORANCE FOR MY LADY TOLD ME THEY WERE PIECES OF VALUABLE MARBLE USED TO MAKE THE FLOORS OF THE GREAT ROMAN EMPERORS PALACES LONG AGO
7265-74918-0021 SHE HAD DONE SO AND MEANT TO HAVE HAD THEM MADE INTO A TABLE BUT SOMEHOW THAT PLAN FELL THROUGH
7265-74918-0022 THEN IN THIS BUREAU WERE MANY OTHER THINGS THE VALUE OF WHICH I COULD UNDERSTAND LOCKS OF HAIR CAREFULLY TICKETED WHICH MY LADY LOOKED AT VERY SADLY AND LOCKETS AND BRACELETS WITH MINIATURES IN THEM VERY SMALL PICTURES TO WHAT THEY MAKE NOW A DAYS AND CALLED MINIATURES
7265-74918-0023 SOME OF THEM HAD EVEN TO BE LOOKED AT THROUGH A MICROSCOPE BEFORE YOU COULD SEE THE INDIVIDUAL EXPRESSION OF THE FACES OR HOW BEAUTIFULLY THEY WERE PAINTED I DON'T THINK THAT LOOKING AT THESE MADE MAY LADY SEEM SO MELANCHOLY AS THE SEEING AND TOUCHING OF THE HAIR DID
7265-74918-0024 BUT TO BE SURE THE HAIR WAS AS IT WERE A PART OF SOME BELOVED BODY WHICH SHE MIGHT NEVER TOUCH AND CARESS AGAIN BUT WHICH LAY BENEATH THE TURF ALL FADED AND DISFIGURED EXCEPT PERHAPS THE VERY HAIR FROM WHICH THE LOCK SHE HELD HAD BEEN DISSEVERED WHEREAS THE PICTURES WERE BUT PICTURES AFTER ALL
7265-74918-0025 LIKENESSES BUT NOT THE VERY THINGS THEMSELVES THIS IS ONLY MY OWN CONJECTURE MIND MY LADY RARELY SPOKE OUT HER FEELINGS FOR TO BEGIN WITH SHE WAS OF RANK AND I HAVE HEARD HER SAY THAT PEOPLE OF RANK DO NOT TALK ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS EXCEPT TO THEIR EQUALS
7265-74918-0026 THIRDLY SHE HAD LONG BEEN A WIDOW WITHOUT ANY COMPANION OF HER OWN AGE WITH WHOM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NATURAL FOR HER TO REFER TO OLD ASSOCIATIONS PAST PLEASURES OR MUTUAL SORROWS MISSUS MEDLICOTT CAME NEAREST TO HER AS A COMPANION OF THIS SORT
7265-74918-0027 AND HER LADYSHIP TALKED MORE TO MISSUS MEDLICOTT IN A KIND OF FAMILIAR WAY THAN SHE DID TO ALL THE REST OF THE HOUSEHOLD PUT TOGETHER BUT MISSUS MEDLICOTT WAS SILENT BY NATURE AND DID NOT REPLY AT ANY GREAT LENGTH ADAMS INDEED WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SPOKE MUCH TO LADY LUDLOW
7265-74918-0028 AFTER WE HAD WORKED AWAY ABOUT AN HOUR AT THE BUREAU HER LADYSHIP SAID WE HAD DONE ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY AND AS THE TIME WAS COME FOR HER AFTERNOON RIDE SHE LEFT ME WITH A VOLUME OF ENGRAVINGS FROM MISTER HOGARTH'S PICTURES ON ONE SIDE OF ME
7265-74918-0029 I DON'T LIKE TO WRITE DOWN THE NAMES OF THEM THOUGH MY LADY THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT I AM SURE AND UPON A STAND HER GREAT PRAYER BOOK OPEN AT THE EVENING PSALMS FOR THE DAY ON THE OTHER BUT AS SOON AS SHE WAS GONE I TROUBLED MYSELF LITTLE WITH EITHER BUT AMUSED MYSELF WITH LOOKING ROUND THE ROOM AT MY LEISURE
7265-74918-0030 AND UP AND DOWN THE CEILING AS WELL THERE WAS VERY LITTLE LOOKING GLASS IN THE ROOM THOUGH ONE OF THE GREAT DRAWING ROOMS WAS CALLED THE MIRROR ROOM BECAUSE IT WAS LINED WITH GLASS WHICH MY LADY'S GREAT GRANDFATHER HAD BROUGHT FROM VENICE WHEN HE WAS AMBASSADOR THERE
7265-74918-0031 THERE WERE CHINA JARS OF ALL SHAPES AND SIZES ROUND AND ABOUT THE ROOM AND SOME CHINA MONSTERS OR IDOLS OF WHICH I COULD NEVER BEAR THE SIGHT THEY WERE SO UGLY THOUGH I THINK MY LADY VALUED THEM MORE THAN ALL
7265-74918-0032 THE ROOM WAS FULL OF SCENT PARTLY FROM THE FLOWERS OUTSIDE AND PARTLY FROM THE GREAT JARS OF POT POURRI INSIDE THE CHOICE OF ODOURS WAS WHAT MY LADY PIQUED HERSELF UPON SAYING NOTHING SHOWED BIRTH LIKE A KEEN SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SMELL
7265-74918-0033 WE NEVER NAMED MUSK IN HER PRESENCE HER ANTIPATHY TO IT WAS SO WELL UNDERSTOOD THROUGH THE HOUSEHOLD HER OPINION ON THE SUBJECT WAS BELIEVED TO BE THAT NO SCENT DERIVED FROM AN ANIMAL COULD EVER BE OF A SUFFICIENTLY PURE NATURE TO GIVE PLEASURE TO ANY PERSON OF GOOD FAMILY
7265-74918-0034 WHERE OF COURSE THE DELICATE PERCEPTION OF THE SENSES HAD BEEN CULTIVATED FOR GENERATIONS
7265-74918-0035 NO MORE WERE BERGAMOT OR SOUTHERN WOOD ALTHOUGH VEGETABLE IN THEIR NATURE SHE CONSIDERED THESE TWO LATTER AS BETRAYING A VULGAR TASTE IN THE PERSON WHO CHOSE TO GATHER OR WEAR THEM SHE WAS SORRY TO NOTICE SPRIGS OF THEM IN THE BUTTON HOLE OF ANY YOUNG MAN IN WHOM SHE TOOK AN INTEREST
7265-74918-0036 AS HE CAME OUT OF CHURCH ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON
7265-74918-0037 BUT SHE DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN VULGAR AND COMMON VIOLETS PINKS AND SWEETBRIAR WERE COMMON ENOUGH ROSES AND MIGNIONETTE FOR THOSE WHO HAD GARDENS HONEYSUCKLE FOR THOSE WHO WALKED ALONG THE BOWERY LANES BUT WEARING THEM BETRAYED NO VULGARITY OF TASTE
7265-74918-0038 A BEAU POT AS WE CALLED IT OF PINKS AND ROSES FRESHLY GATHERED WAS PLACED EVERY MORNING THAT THEY WERE IN BLOOM ON MY LADY'S OWN PARTICULAR TABLE
7265-74918-0039 SWEET WOODROOF AGAIN GREW IN WILD WOODLAND PLACES WHERE THE SOIL WAS FINE AND THE AIR DELICATE THE POOR CHILDREN USED TO GO AND GATHER IT FOR HER UP IN THE WOODS ON THE HIGHER LANDS AND FOR THIS SERVICE SHE ALWAYS REWARDED THEM WITH BRIGHT NEW PENNIES OF WHICH MY LORD HER SON
7265-74918-0040 BUT THE GREAT HEREDITARY FACULTY ON WHICH MY LADY PIQUED HERSELF AND WITH REASON FOR I NEVER MET WITH ANY PERSON WHO POSSESSED IT WAS THE POWER SHE HAD OF PERCEIVING THE DELICIOUS ODOUR ARISING FROM A BED OF STRAWBERRIES IN THE LATE AUTUMN WHEN THE LEAVES WERE ALL FADING AND DYING
7265-74918-0041 BACON'S ESSAYS WAS ONE OF THE FEW BOOKS THAT LAY ABOUT IN MY LADY'S ROOM AND IF YOU TOOK IT UP AND OPENED IT CARELESSLY IT WAS SURE TO FALL APART AT HIS ESSAY ON GARDENS LISTEN HER LADYSHIP WOULD SAY TO WHAT THAT GREAT PHILOSOPHER AND STATESMAN SAYS
7265-74918-0042 OF WHICH YOU REMEMBER THE GREAT BUSH AT THE CORNER OF THE SOUTH WALL JUST BY THE BLUE DRAWING ROOM WINDOWS THAT IS THE OLD MUSK ROSE SHAKESPEARE'S MUSK ROSE WHICH IS DYING OUT THROUGH THE KINGDOM NOW BUT TO RETURN TO MY LORD BACON
7265-74918-0043 AND THOUGHT THAT IT WAS IN SOME OSTENTATION OF HER OWN POWERS THAT SHE ORDERED THE GARDENER TO PLANT A BORDER OF STRAWBERRIES ON THAT SIDE OF THE TERRACE THAT LAY UNDER HER WINDOWS I HAVE WANDERED AWAY FROM TIME AND PLACE
7265-74918-0044 SOMETIMES SITTING IN THE EASY CHAIR DOING SOME LITTLE PIECE OF DAINTY WORK FOR MY LADY
7265-74918-0045 THAN AS BEING MY LORD LUDLOW WITH HALF A DOZEN OTHER MINOR TITLES WITH THIS WISH OF RELEASING HER PROPERTY FROM THE MORTGAGE SKILFUL CARE WAS MUCH NEEDED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF IT AND AS FAR AS MY LADY COULD GO SHE TOOK EVERY PAINS
7265-74918-0046 SHE HAD A GREAT BOOK IN WHICH EVERY PAGE WAS RULED INTO THREE DIVISIONS ON THE FIRST COLUMN WAS WRITTEN THE DATE AND THE NAME OF THE TENANT WHO ADDRESSED ANY LETTER ON BUSINESS TO HER ON THE SECOND WAS BRIEFLY STATED THE SUBJECT OF THE LETTER WHICH GENERALLY CONTAINED A REQUEST OF SOME KIND
7265-74918-0047 NOW IN THE SECOND COLUMN OF THIS BOOK THE GRAIN OF MEANING WAS PLACED CLEAN AND DRY BEFORE HER LADYSHIP EVERY MORNING SHE SOMETIMES WOULD ASK TO SEE THE ORIGINAL LETTER SOMETIMES SHE SIMPLY ANSWERED THE REQUEST BY A YES OR A NO
7265-74918-0048 WITH MISTER HORNER AT HER ELBOW TO SEE IF SUCH PETITIONS AS TO BE ALLOWED TO PLOUGH UP PASTURE FIELDS WERE PROVIDED FOR IN THE TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT ON EVERY THURSDAY SHE MADE HERSELF AT LIBERTY TO SEE HER TENANTS FROM FOUR TO SIX IN THE AFTERNOON
7265-74918-0049 MORNINGS WOULD HAVE SUITED MY LADY BETTER AS FAR AS CONVENIENCE WENT AND I BELIEVE THE OLD CUSTOM HAD BEEN TO HAVE THESE LEVEES AS HER LADYSHIP USED TO CALL THEM HELD BEFORE TWELVE BUT AS SHE SAID TO MISTER HORNER WHEN HE URGED RETURNING TO THE FORMER HOURS
7265-74918-0050 AND MY LADY LIKED TO SEE HER TENANTS COME IN THEIR SUNDAY CLOTHES SHE WOULD NOT SAY A WORD MAYBE BUT SHE WOULD TAKE HER SPECTACLES SLOWLY OUT AND PUT THEM ON WITH SILENT GRAVITY AND LOOK AT A DIRTY OR RAGGEDLY DRESSED MAN SO SOLEMNLY AND EARNESTLY
7265-74918-0051 AND RESOLVE THAT HOWEVER POOR HE MIGHT BE
7265-74918-0052 FOR MY LADY SAID THOUGH THERE WERE NOT MANY HOURS LEFT OF A WORKING MAN'S DAY WHEN THEIR BUSINESS WITH HER WAS ENDED
7265-74918-0053 AT ANY RATE NO MORE LIQUOR WAS GIVEN THEM THE TENANTS ONE AND ALL CALLED HER MADAM FOR THEY RECOGNIZED IN HER THE MARRIED HEIRESS OF THE HANBURYS NOT THE WIDOW OF A LORD LUDLOW OF WHOM THEY AND THEIR FOREFATHERS KNEW NOTHING
7265-74918-0054 I AM SURE FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND I WAS BEHIND THE SCENES AS IT WERE AND HAD MANY AN OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING AND HEARING AS I LAY OR SAT MOTIONLESS IN MY LADY'S ROOM WITH THE DOUBLE DOORS OPEN BETWEEN IT AND THE ANTEROOM BEYOND
7265-74918-0055 AND SOME TIME OR OTHER HE HAD PROBABLY SPOKEN HIS MIND OUT TO MY LADY
7265-74918-0056 WHILE EVERY NOW AND THEN THERE WAS AN IMPLIED PROTEST WHENEVER THE PAYMENTS OF THE INTEREST BECAME DUE OR WHENEVER MY LADY STINTED HERSELF OF ANY PERSONAL EXPENSE SUCH AS MISTER HORNER THOUGHT WAS ONLY DECOROUS AND BECOMING IN THE HEIRESS OF THE HANBURYS
7265-74918-0057 AND MY LADY WOULD HAVE LIVED ON BREAD AND WATER SOONER THAN HAVE CALLED UPON HIM TO HELP HER IN PAYING OFF THE MORTGAGE ALTHOUGH HE WAS THE ONE WHO WAS TO BENEFIT BY IT IN THE END MISTER HORNER WAS A VERY FAITHFUL STEWARD AND VERY RESPECTFUL TO MY LADY
7265-74918-0058 PERHAPS BECAUSE SHE KNEW THAT ALTHOUGH HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING HE DISAPPROVED OF THE HANBURYS BEING MADE TO PAY FOR THE EARL LUDLOW'S ESTATES AND STATE THE LATE LORD HAD BEEN A SAILOR AND HAD BEEN AS EXTRAVAGANT IN HIS HABITS AS MOST SAILORS ARE I AM TOLD FOR I NEVER SAW THE SEA
7265-74918-0059 AND YET HE HAD A LONG SIGHT TO HIS OWN INTERESTS BUT WHATEVER HE WAS MY LADY LOVED HIM AND HIS MEMORY WITH ABOUT AS FOND AND PROUD A LOVE AS EVER WIFE GAVE HUSBAND I SHOULD THINK
7265-74918-0060 THOUGH HIS NEW FANGLED NOTIONS WERE WHAT FOLK AT THE PRESENT DAY WOULD THINK SADLY BEHINDHAND AND SOME OF MISTER GRAY'S IDEAS FELL ON MISTER HORNER'S MIND LIKE SPARKS ON TOW THOUGH THEY STARTED FROM TWO DIFFERENT POINTS
7265-74918-0061 AND THEREFORE HE FELL INTO THE NEW CRY FOR EDUCATION MISTER GRAY DID NOT CARE MUCH MISTER HORNER THOUGHT NOT ENOUGH FOR THIS WORLD AND WHERE ANY MAN OR FAMILY STOOD IN THEIR EARTHLY POSITION
7265-74918-0062 AND CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING AND RECEIVING CERTAIN DOCTRINES FOR WHICH LATTER PURPOSE IT STANDS TO REASON HE MUST HAVE HEARD OF THESE DOCTRINES AND THEREFORE MISTER GRAY WANTED EDUCATION THE ANSWER IN THE CATECHISM THAT MISTER HORNER WAS MOST FOND OF CALLING UPON A CHILD TO REPEAT WAS THAT TO
7265-74918-0063 WHAT IS THY DUTY TOWARDS THY NEIGHBOUR THE ANSWER MISTER GRAY LIKED BEST TO HEAR REPEATED WITH UNCTION WAS THAT TO THE QUESTION WHAT IS THE INWARD AND SPIRITUAL GRACE
7265-74918-0064 WHAT IS THY DUTY TOWARDS GOD BUT NEITHER MISTER HORNER NOR MISTER GRAY HAD HEARD MANY ANSWERS TO THE CATECHISM AS YET UP TO THIS TIME THERE WAS NO SUNDAY SCHOOL IN HANBURY MISTER GRAY'S DESIRES WERE BOUNDED BY THAT OBJECT
