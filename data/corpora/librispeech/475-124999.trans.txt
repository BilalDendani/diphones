475-124999-0000 REGINALD'S CHOIR TREAT NEVER WROTE REGINALD TO HIS MOST DARLING FRIEND BE A PIONEER IT'S THE EARLY CHRISTIAN THAT GETS THE FATTEST LION REGINALD IN HIS WAY
475-124999-0001 WAS A PIONEER NONE OF THE REST OF HIS FAMILY HAD ANYTHING APPROACHING TITIAN HAIR OR A SENSE OF HUMOUR AND THEY USED PRIMROSES AS A TABLE DECORATION
475-124999-0002 IT FOLLOWS THAT THEY NEVER UNDERSTOOD REGINALD WHO CAME DOWN LATE TO BREAKFAST AND NIBBLED TOAST AND SAID DISRESPECTFUL THINGS ABOUT THE UNIVERSE THE FAMILY ATE PORRIDGE AND BELIEVED IN EVERYTHING
475-124999-0003 EVEN THE WEATHER FORECAST THEREFORE THE FAMILY WAS RELIEVED WHEN THE VICAR'S DAUGHTER UNDERTOOK THE REFORMATION OF REGINALD HER NAME WAS AMABEL IT WAS THE VICAR'S ONE EXTRAVAGANCE
475-124999-0004 AMABEL WAS ACCOUNTED A BEAUTY AND INTELLECTUALLY GIFTED SHE NEVER PLAYED TENNIS AND WAS REPUTED TO HAVE READ MAETERLINCK'S LIFE OF THE BEE IF YOU ABSTAIN FROM TENNIS AND READ MAETERLINCK IN A SMALL COUNTRY VILLAGE
475-124999-0005 YOU ARE OF NECESSITY INTELLECTUAL ALSO SHE HAD BEEN TWICE TO FECAMP TO PICK UP A GOOD FRENCH ACCENT FROM THE AMERICANS STAYING THERE CONSEQUENTLY SHE HAD A KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD
475-124999-0006 WHICH MIGHT BE CONSIDERED USEFUL IN DEALINGS WITH A WORLDLING HENCE THE CONGRATULATIONS IN THE FAMILY WHEN AMABEL UNDERTOOK THE REFORMATION OF ITS WAYWARD MEMBER
475-124999-0007 AMABEL COMMENCED OPERATIONS BY ASKING HER UNSUSPECTING PUPIL TO TEA IN THE VICARAGE GARDEN SHE BELIEVED IN THE HEALTHY INFLUENCE OF NATURAL SURROUNDINGS NEVER HAVING BEEN IN SICILY WHERE THINGS
475-124999-0008 ARE DIFFERENT AND LIKE EVERY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER PREACHED REPENTANCE TO UNREGENERATE YOUTH SHE DWELT ON THE SIN OF AN EMPTY LIFE WHICH ALWAYS SEEMS SO MUCH MORE SCANDALOUS IN THE COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE RISE EARLY
475-124999-0009 TO SEE IF A NEW STRAWBERRY HAS HAPPENED DURING THE NIGHT REGINALD RECALLED THE LILIES OF THE FIELD WHICH SIMPLY SAT AND LOOKED BEAUTIFUL AND DEFIED COMPETITION BUT THAT IS NOT AN EXAMPLE FOR US TO FOLLOW
475-124999-0010 GASPED AMABEL UNFORTUNATELY WE CAN'T AFFORD TO YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A WORLD OF TROUBLE I TAKE IN TRYING TO RIVAL THE LILIES IN THEIR ARTISTIC SIMPLICITY
475-124999-0011 A GOOD LIFE IS INFINITELY PREFERABLE TO GOOD LOOKS YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT THE TWO ARE INCOMPATIBLE I ALWAYS SAY BEAUTY IS ONLY SIN DEEP
475-124999-0012 AMABEL BEGAN TO REALISE THAT THE BATTLE IS NOT ALWAYS TO THE STRONG MINDED WITH THE IMMEMORIAL RESOURCE OF HER SEX SHE ABANDONED THE FRONTAL ATTACK
475-124999-0013 AND LAID STRESS ON HER UNASSISTED LABOURS IN PARISH WORK HER MENTAL LONELINESS HER DISCOURAGEMENTS AND AT THE RIGHT MOMENT SHE PRODUCED STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM REGINALD WAS OBVIOUSLY AFFECTED BY THE LATTER
475-124999-0014 AND WHEN HIS PRECEPTRESS SUGGESTED THAT HE MIGHT BEGIN THE STRENUOUS LIFE BY HELPING HER TO SUPERVISE THE ANNUAL OUTING OF THE BUCOLIC INFANTS WHO COMPOSED THE LOCAL CHOIR HIS EYES SHONE WITH THE DANGEROUS ENTHUSIASM OF A CONVERT
475-124999-0015 REGINALD ENTERED ON THE STRENUOUS LIFE ALONE AS FAR AS AMABEL WAS CONCERNED THE MOST VIRTUOUS WOMEN ARE NOT PROOF AGAINST DAMP GRASS AND AMABEL KEPT HER BED WITH A COLD
475-124999-0016 REGINALD CALLED IT A DISPENSATION IT HAD BEEN THE DREAM OF HIS LIFE TO STAGE MANAGE A CHOIR OUTING WITH STRATEGIC INSIGHT HE LED HIS SHY BULLET HEADED CHARGES TO THE NEAREST WOODLAND STREAM AND ALLOWED THEM TO BATHE
475-124999-0017 THEN HE SEATED HIMSELF ON THEIR DISCARDED GARMENTS AND DISCOURSED ON THEIR IMMEDIATE FUTURE WHICH HE DECREED WAS TO EMBRACE A BACCHANALIAN PROCESSION THROUGH THE VILLAGE
475-124999-0018 FORETHOUGHT HAD PROVIDED THE OCCASION WITH A SUPPLY OF TIN WHISTLES BUT THE INTRODUCTION OF A HE GOAT FROM A NEIGHBOURING ORCHARD WAS A BRILLIANT AFTERTHOUGHT PROPERLY REGINALD EXPLAINED
475-124999-0019 AS IT WAS THOSE WHO HAD SPOTTED HANDKERCHIEFS WERE ALLOWED TO WEAR THEM WHICH THEY DID WITH THANKFULNESS REGINALD RECOGNISED THE IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE TIME AT HIS DISPOSAL
475-124999-0020 OF TEACHING HIS SHIVERING NEOPHYTES A CHANT IN HONOUR OF BACCHUS SO HE STARTED THEM OFF WITH A MORE FAMILIAR IF LESS APPROPRIATE TEMPERANCE HYMN AFTER ALL HE SAID IT IS THE SPIRIT OF THE THING THAT COUNTS
475-124999-0021 FOLLOWING THE ETIQUETTE OF DRAMATIC AUTHORS ON FIRST NIGHTS HE REMAINED DISCREETLY IN THE BACKGROUND WHILE THE PROCESSION WITH EXTREME DIFFIDENCE AND THE GOAT WOUND ITS WAY LUGUBRIOUSLY TOWARDS THE VILLAGE
475-124999-0022 THE SINGING HAD DIED DOWN LONG BEFORE THE MAIN STREET WAS REACHED BUT THE MISERABLE WAILING OF PIPES BROUGHT THE INHABITANTS TO THEIR DOORS REGINALD SAID HE HAD SEEN SOMETHING LIKE IT IN PICTURES
475-124999-0023 THE VILLAGERS HAD SEEN NOTHING LIKE IT IN THEIR LIVES AND REMARKED AS MUCH FREELY REGINALD'S FAMILY NEVER FORGAVE HIM
