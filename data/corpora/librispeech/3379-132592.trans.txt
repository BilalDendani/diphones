3379-132592-0000 THE BARON SAINT FOIX WHOM ANXIETY FOR HIS FRIEND HAD KEPT AWAKE ROSE EARLY TO ENQUIRE THE EVENT OF THE NIGHT WHEN AS HE PASSED THE COUNT'S CLOSET HEARING STEPS WITHIN HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
3379-132592-0001 WHOSE RESERVED ANSWERS FIRST OCCASIONED HIM TO NOTICE IT THE COUNT THEN SMILING ENDEAVOURED TO TREAT THE SUBJECT OF HIS CURIOSITY WITH LEVITY BUT THE BARON WAS SERIOUS AND PURSUED HIS ENQUIRIES SO CLOSELY THAT THE COUNT
3379-132592-0002 YOU WILL NOT QUESTION HIM ON THIS TOPIC MY FRIEND SINCE YOU KNOW MY WISH CERTAINLY NOT SAID THE BARON SOMEWHAT CHAGRINED SINCE IT WOULD BE DISPLEASING TO YOU BUT METHINKS MY FRIEND YOU MIGHT RELY ON MY DISCRETION
3379-132592-0003 AND DROP THIS UNUSUAL RESERVE HOWEVER YOU MUST ALLOW ME TO SUSPECT
3379-132592-0004 AND MY PRESENT RESERVE CANNOT MAKE YOU QUESTION EITHER MY ESTEEM OR THE SINCERITY OF MY FRIENDSHIP I WILL NOT DOUBT EITHER SAID THE BARON THOUGH YOU MUST ALLOW ME TO EXPRESS MY SURPRISE AT THIS SILENCE
3379-132592-0005 FROM THE NORTH CHAMBERS SINCE HENRI AND HIMSELF HAD BEEN PERMITTED TO RETURN FROM THEM IN SAFETY HENRI HOWEVER WAS LESS SUCCESSFUL IN DISGUISING HIS FEELINGS FROM HIS COUNTENANCE AN EXPRESSION OF TERROR WAS NOT ENTIRELY FADED
3379-132592-0006 HE WAS OFTEN SILENT AND THOUGHTFUL AND WHEN HE ATTEMPTED TO LAUGH AT THE EAGER ENQUIRIES OF MADEMOISELLE BEARN IT WAS EVIDENTLY ONLY AN ATTEMPT IN THE EVENING THE COUNT CALLED AS HE HAD PROMISED
3379-132592-0007 AT THE CONVENT AND EMILY WAS SURPRISED TO PERCEIVE A MIXTURE OF PLAYFUL RIDICULE AND OF RESERVE IN HIS MENTION OF THE NORTH APARTMENT OF WHAT HAD OCCURRED THERE HOWEVER HE SAID NOTHING AND WHEN SHE VENTURED TO REMIND HIM OF HIS PROMISE TO TELL HER THE RESULT OF HIS ENQUIRIES
3379-132592-0008 AND TO ASK IF HE HAD RECEIVED ANY PROOF THAT THOSE CHAMBERS WERE HAUNTED HIS LOOK BECAME SOLEMN FOR A MOMENT THEN SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF HE SMILED AND SAID MY DEAR EMILY
3379-132592-0009 SHE WILL TEACH YOU TO EXPECT A GHOST IN EVERY DARK ROOM BUT BELIEVE ME ADDED HE WITH A PROFOUND SIGH THE APPARITION OF THE DEAD COMES NOT ON LIGHT OR SPORTIVE ERRANDS TO TERRIFY OR TO SURPRISE THE TIMID
3379-132592-0010 SOON AFTER HE TOOK LEAVE AND WHEN EMILY JOINED SOME OF THE NUNS SHE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THEM ACQUAINTED WITH A CIRCUMSTANCE
3379-132592-0011 AND EXPRESSING THEIR ADMIRATION OF HIS INTREPIDITY IN HAVING DARED TO PASS A NIGHT IN THE APARTMENT WHENCE LUDOVICO HAD DISAPPEARED FOR SHE HAD NOT CONSIDERED WITH WHAT RAPIDITY A TALE OF WONDER CIRCULATES THE NUNS HAD ACQUIRED THEIR INFORMATION FROM PEASANTS
3379-132592-0012 WHO BROUGHT FRUIT TO THE MONASTERY AND WHOSE WHOLE ATTENTION HAD BEEN FIXED SINCE THE DISAPPEARANCE OF LUDOVICO ON WHAT WAS PASSING IN THE CASTLE EMILY LISTENED IN SILENCE TO THE VARIOUS OPINIONS OF THE NUNS
3379-132592-0013 THAT THE COUNT HAD ACTED WITH THE BRAVERY OF A VIRTUOUS MIND HE KNEW HIMSELF GUILTLESS OF AUGHT THAT SHOULD PROVOKE A GOOD SPIRIT AND DID NOT FEAR THE SPELLS OF AN EVIL ONE SINCE HE COULD CLAIM THE PROTECTION OF AN HIGHER POWER
3379-132592-0014 THAT SHALL DARE TO CALL HIMSELF INNOCENT ALL EARTHLY INNOCENCE IS BUT COMPARATIVE YET STILL HOW WIDE ASUNDER ARE THE EXTREMES OF GUILT AND TO WHAT AN HORRIBLE DEPTH MAY WE FALL OH
3379-132592-0015 THE NUN AS SHE CONCLUDED UTTERED A SHUDDERING SIGH THAT STARTLED EMILY WHO LOOKING UP PERCEIVED THE EYES OF AGNES FIXED ON HERS AFTER WHICH THE SISTER ROSE TOOK HER HAND GAZED EARNESTLY UPON HER COUNTENANCE
3379-132592-0016 FOR SOME MOMENTS IN SILENCE AND THEN SAID YOU ARE YOUNG YOU ARE INNOCENT I MEAN YOU ARE YET INNOCENT OF ANY GREAT CRIME BUT YOU HAVE PASSIONS IN YOUR HEART SCORPIONS THEY SLEEP NOW BEWARE HOW YOU AWAKEN THEM
3379-132592-0017 THEY WILL STING YOU EVEN UNTO DEATH EMILY AFFECTED BY THESE WORDS AND BY THE SOLEMNITY WITH WHICH THEY WERE DELIVERED COULD NOT SUPPRESS HER TEARS AH IS IT SO EXCLAIMED AGNES HER COUNTENANCE SOFTENING FROM ITS STERNNESS
3379-132592-0018 WE ARE SISTERS THEN INDEED YET THERE IS NO BOND OF KINDNESS AMONG THE GUILTY SHE ADDED WHILE HER EYES RESUMED THEIR WILD EXPRESSION NO GENTLENESS NO PEACE NO HOPE I KNEW THEM ALL ONCE MY EYES COULD WEEP BUT NOW THEY BURN
3379-132592-0019 WHO REPENT AND TURN TO THE TRUE FAITH OBSERVED SISTER FRANCES FOR ALL BUT ME REPLIED AGNES SOLEMNLY WHO PAUSED AND THEN ABRUPTLY ADDED MY HEAD BURNS I BELIEVE I AM NOT WELL O
3379-132592-0020 THE FIGURES THAT RISE UP LIKE FURIES TO TORMENT ME I SEE THEM WHEN I SLEEP AND WHEN I AM AWAKE THEY ARE STILL BEFORE MY EYES I SEE THEM NOW NOW SHE STOOD IN A FIXED ATTITUDE OF HORROR
3379-132592-0021 HER STRAINING EYES MOVING SLOWLY ROUND THE ROOM AS IF THEY FOLLOWED SOMETHING ONE OF THE NUNS GENTLY TOOK HER HAND TO LEAD HER FROM THE PARLOUR AGNES BECAME CALM DREW HER OTHER HAND ACROSS HER EYES LOOKED AGAIN AND SIGHING
3379-132592-0022 DEEPLY SAID THEY ARE GONE THEY ARE GONE I AM FEVERISH I KNOW NOT WHAT I SAY I AM THUS SOMETIMES BUT IT WILL GO OFF AGAIN I SHALL SOON BE BETTER WAS NOT THAT THE VESPER BELL NO REPLIED FRANCES
3379-132592-0023 THE EVENING SERVICE IS PASSED LET MARGARET LEAD YOU TO YOUR CELL YOU ARE RIGHT REPLIED SISTER AGNES I SHALL BE BETTER THERE GOOD NIGHT MY SISTERS REMEMBER ME IN YOUR ORISONS WHEN THEY HAD WITHDRAWN FRANCES
3379-132592-0024 OBSERVING EMILY'S EMOTION SAID DO NOT BE ALARMED OUR SISTER IS OFTEN THUS DERANGED THOUGH I HAVE NOT LATELY SEEN HER SO FRANTIC HER USUAL MOOD IS MELANCHOLY THIS FIT HAS BEEN COMING ON FOR SEVERAL DAYS
3379-132592-0025 SECLUSION AND THE CUSTOMARY TREATMENT WILL RESTORE HER BUT HOW RATIONALLY SHE CONVERSED AT FIRST OBSERVED EMILY HER IDEAS FOLLOWED EACH OTHER IN PERFECT ORDER YES REPLIED THE NUN THIS IS NOTHING NEW NAY
3379-132592-0026 I HAVE SOMETIMES KNOWN HER ARGUE NOT ONLY WITH METHOD BUT WITH ACUTENESS AND THEN IN A MOMENT START OFF INTO MADNESS HER CONSCIENCE SEEMS AFFLICTED SAID EMILY DID YOU EVER HEAR WHAT CIRCUMSTANCE REDUCED HER TO THIS DEPLORABLE CONDITION
3379-132592-0027 I HAVE REPLIED THE NUN WHO SAID NO MORE TILL EMILY REPEATED THE QUESTION WHEN SHE ADDED IN A LOW VOICE AND LOOKING SIGNIFICANTLY TOWARDS THE OTHER BOARDERS I CANNOT TELL YOU NOW BUT IF YOU THINK IT WORTH YOUR WHILE
3379-132592-0028 COME TO MY CELL TO NIGHT WHEN OUR SISTERHOOD ARE AT REST AND YOU SHALL HEAR MORE BUT REMEMBER WE RISE TO MIDNIGHT PRAYERS AND COME EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER MIDNIGHT EMILY PROMISED TO REMEMBER
3379-132592-0029 THAT HAD SUBSISTED TOO LONG TO BE EASILY SUBDUED AND WHICH HAD ALREADY OUTLIVED THE OPPOSITION OF HIS FRIENDS M DU PONT HAD FIRST SEEN EMILY IN GASCONY DURING THE LIFETIME OF HIS PARENT WHO
3379-132592-0030 ON DISCOVERING HIS SON'S PARTIALITY FOR MADEMOISELLE SAINT AUBERT HIS INFERIOR IN POINT OF FORTUNE
3379-132592-0031 OR TO THINK OF HER MORE DURING THE LIFE OF HIS FATHER HE HAD OBSERVED THE FIRST COMMAND BUT HAD FOUND IT IMPRACTICABLE TO OBEY THE SECOND AND HAD SOMETIMES SOOTHED HIS PASSION BY VISITING HER FAVOURITE HAUNTS
3379-132592-0032 AMONG WHICH WAS THE FISHING HOUSE WHERE ONCE OR TWICE HE ADDRESSED HER IN VERSE CONCEALING HIS NAME IN OBEDIENCE TO THE PROMISE HE HAD GIVEN HIS FATHER THERE TOO HE PLAYED THE PATHETIC AIR TO WHICH SHE HAD LISTENED WITH SUCH SURPRISE AND ADMIRATION
3379-132592-0033 THAT HAD SINCE CHERISHED A PASSION FATAL TO HIS REPOSE DURING HIS EXPEDITION INTO ITALY HIS FATHER DIED BUT HE RECEIVED HIS LIBERTY AT A MOMENT WHEN HE WAS THE LEAST ENABLED TO PROFIT BY IT SINCE THE OBJECT THAT RENDERED IT MOST VALUABLE
3379-132592-0034 WAS NO LONGER WITHIN THE REACH OF HIS VOWS BY WHAT ACCIDENT HE DISCOVERED EMILY AND ASSISTED TO RELEASE HER FROM A TERRIBLE IMPRISONMENT HAS ALREADY APPEARED AND ALSO THE UNAVAILING HOPE WITH WHICH HE THEN ENCOURAGED HIS LOVE
3379-132592-0035 WHICH DISAPPOINTMENT HAS LEFT ON HER MIND AND SHE WILL BE SENSIBLE OF YOUR MERIT YOUR SERVICES HAVE ALREADY AWAKENED HER GRATITUDE AND YOUR SUFFERINGS HER PITY AND TRUST ME MY FRIEND IN A HEART SO SENSIBLE AS HERS
3379-132592-0036 GRATITUDE AND PITY LEAD TO LOVE WHEN HER IMAGINATION IS RESCUED FROM ITS PRESENT DELUSION
3379-132592-0037 DU PONT SIGHED WHILE HE LISTENED TO THESE WORDS AND ENDEAVOURING TO HOPE WHAT HIS FRIEND BELIEVED HE WILLINGLY YIELDED TO AN INVITATION TO PROLONG HIS VISIT AT THE CHATEAU WHICH WE NOW LEAVE FOR THE MONASTERY OF SAINT CLAIRE
3379-132592-0038 THE DIM LAMP THAT GAVE LIGHT TO THE PLACE TURNING HER EYES AS THE DOOR OPENED SHE BECKONED TO EMILY TO COME IN WHO HAVING DONE SO SEATED HERSELF IN SILENCE BESIDE THE NUN'S LITTLE MATTRESS OF STRAW
3379-132592-0039 WITHOUT OBSERVING HER EMOTION SAT DOWN ON THE MATTRESS BY HER SAYING YOUR CURIOSITY SISTER HAS MADE YOU PUNCTUAL BUT YOU HAVE NOTHING REMARKABLE TO HEAR IN THE HISTORY OF POOR AGNES OF WHOM I AVOIDED TO SPEAK IN THE PRESENCE OF MY LAY SISTERS
3379-132592-0040 AS THE DIGNITY OF HER AIR MUST ALREADY HAVE INFORMED YOU BUT I WILL NOT DISHONOUR THEIR NAME SO MUCH AS TO REVEAL IT LOVE WAS THE OCCASION OF HER CRIME AND OF HER MADNESS SHE WAS BELOVED BY A GENTLEMAN OF INFERIOR FORTUNE AND HER FATHER
3379-132592-0041 AS I HAVE HEARD BESTOWING HER ON A NOBLEMAN WHOM SHE DISLIKED AN ILL GOVERNED PASSION PROVED HER DESTRUCTION EVERY OBLIGATION OF VIRTUE AND OF DUTY WAS FORGOTTEN
3379-132592-0042 BUT HER GUILT WAS SOON DETECTED AND SHE WOULD HAVE FALLEN A SACRIFICE TO THE VENGEANCE OF HER HUSBAND HAD NOT HER FATHER CONTRIVED TO CONVEY HER FROM HIS POWER BY WHAT MEANS HE DID THIS I NEVER COULD LEARN BUT HE SECRETED HER IN THIS CONVENT
3379-132592-0043 WHERE HE AFTERWARDS PREVAILED WITH HER TO TAKE THE VEIL
3379-132592-0044 I ALLOW THE STORY IS UNCOMMON BUT NOT I BELIEVE WITHOUT A PARALLEL PRAY PROCEED SAID EMILY I AM INTERESTED THE STORY IS ALREADY TOLD RESUMED THE NUN I HAVE ONLY TO MENTION
3379-132592-0045 THAT THE LONG STRUGGLE WHICH AGNES SUFFERED BETWEEN LOVE REMORSE
3379-132592-0046 IN BECOMING OF OUR ORDER AT LENGTH UNSETTLED HER REASON AT FIRST SHE WAS FRANTIC AND MELANCHOLY BY QUICK ALTERNATIVES THEN SHE SUNK INTO A DEEP AND SETTLED MELANCHOLY WHICH STILL HOWEVER HAS AT TIMES
3379-132592-0047 BEEN INTERRUPTED BY FITS OF WILDNESS AND OF LATE THESE HAVE AGAIN BEEN FREQUENT EMILY WAS AFFECTED BY THE HISTORY OF THE SISTER SOME PARTS OF WHOSE STORY BROUGHT TO HER REMEMBRANCE THAT OF THE MARCHIONESS
3379-132592-0048 DE VILLEROI WHO HAD ALSO BEEN COMPELLED BY HER FATHER TO FORSAKE THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTIONS FOR A NOBLEMAN OF HIS CHOICE BUT FROM WHAT DOROTHEE HAD RELATED THERE APPEARED NO REASON TO SUPPOSE
3379-132592-0049 THAT SHE HAD ESCAPED THE VENGEANCE OF A JEALOUS HUSBAND OR TO DOUBT FOR A MOMENT THE INNOCENCE OF HER CONDUCT BUT EMILY WHILE SHE SIGHED OVER THE MISERY OF THE NUN COULD NOT FORBEAR SHEDDING A FEW TEARS TO THE MISFORTUNES OF THE MARCHIONESS
3379-132592-0050 AND WHEN SHE RETURNED TO THE MENTION OF SISTER AGNES SHE ASKED FRANCES IF SHE REMEMBERED HER IN HER YOUTH AND WHETHER SHE WAS THEN BEAUTIFUL I WAS NOT HERE AT THE TIME WHEN SHE TOOK THE VOWS REPLIED FRANCES WHICH IS SO LONG AGO
3379-132592-0051 THAT FEW OF THE PRESENT SISTERHOOD I BELIEVE WERE WITNESSES OF THE CEREMONY NAY EVER OUR LADY MOTHER DID NOT THEN PRESIDE OVER THE CONVENT BUT I CAN REMEMBER WHEN SISTER AGNES WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN SHE RETAINS THAT AIR OF HIGH RANK
3379-132592-0052 WHICH ALWAYS DISTINGUISHED HER BUT HER BEAUTY YOU MUST PERCEIVE IS FLED
3379-132592-0053 IT IS STRANGE SAID EMILY BUT THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN HER COUNTENANCE HAS APPEARED FAMILIAR TO MY MEMORY YOU WILL THINK ME FANCIFUL AND I THINK MYSELF SO FOR I CERTAINLY NEVER SAW SISTER AGNES BEFORE I CAME TO THIS CONVENT
3379-132592-0054 AND I MUST THEREFORE HAVE SEEN SOME PERSON WHOM SHE STRONGLY RESEMBLES THOUGH OF THIS I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION YOU HAVE BEEN INTERESTED BY THE DEEP MELANCHOLY OF HER COUNTENANCE SAID FRANCES AND ITS IMPRESSION HAS PROBABLY DELUDED YOUR IMAGINATION
3379-132592-0055 FOR I MIGHT AS REASONABLY THINK I PERCEIVE A LIKENESS BETWEEN YOU AND AGNES AS YOU THAT YOU HAVE SEEN HER ANY WHERE BUT IN THIS CONVENT SINCE THIS HAS BEEN HER PLACE OF REFUGE FOR NEARLY AS MANY YEARS AS MAKE YOUR AGE
3379-132592-0056 INDEED SAID EMILY YES REJOINED FRANCES AND WHY DOES THAT CIRCUMSTANCE EXCITE YOUR SURPRISE EMILY DID NOT APPEAR TO NOTICE THIS QUESTION BUT REMAINED THOUGHTFUL FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN SAID
3379-132592-0057 IT WAS ABOUT THAT SAME PERIOD THAT THE MARCHIONESS DE VILLEROI EXPIRED THAT IS AN ODD REMARK SAID FRANCES EMILY RECALLED FROM HER REVERIE SMILED AND GAVE THE CONVERSATION ANOTHER TURN
3379-132592-0058 BUT IT SOON CAME BACK TO THE SUBJECT OF THE UNHAPPY NUN AND EMILY REMAINED IN THE CELL OF SISTER FRANCES TILL THE MID NIGHT BELL AROUSED HER WHEN APOLOGIZING FOR HAVING INTERRUPTED THE SISTER'S REPOSE TILL THIS LATE HOUR THEY QUITTED THE CELL TOGETHER
3379-132592-0059 EMILY RETURNED TO HER CHAMBER AND THE NUN BEARING A GLIMMERING TAPER WENT TO HER DEVOTION IN THE CHAPEL SEVERAL DAYS FOLLOWED DURING WHICH EMILY SAW NEITHER THE COUNT OR ANY OF HIS FAMILY
3379-132592-0060 THAT HIS AIR WAS UNUSUALLY DISTURBED MY SPIRITS ARE HARASSED SAID HE IN ANSWER TO HER ANXIOUS ENQUIRIES AND I MEAN TO CHANGE MY RESIDENCE FOR A LITTLE WHILE AN EXPERIMENT WHICH I HOPE WILL RESTORE MY MIND TO ITS USUAL TRANQUILLITY
3379-132592-0061 MY DAUGHTER AND MYSELF WILL ACCOMPANY THE BARON SAINT FOIX TO HIS CHATEAU IT LIES IN A VALLEY OF THE PYRENEES THAT OPENS TOWARDS GASCONY AND I HAVE BEEN THINKING
3379-132592-0062 WHEN YOU SET OUT FOR LA VALLEE WE MAY GO PART OF THE WAY TOGETHER IT WOULD BE A SATISFACTION TO ME TO GUARD YOU TOWARDS YOUR HOME SHE THANKED THE COUNT FOR HIS FRIENDLY CONSIDERATION AND LAMENTED THAT THE NECESSITY FOR HER GOING FIRST TO
3379-132592-0063 WOULD RENDER THIS PLAN IMPRACTICABLE BUT WHEN YOU ARE AT THE BARON'S RESIDENCE SHE ADDED YOU WILL BE ONLY A SHORT JOURNEY FROM LA VALLEE AND I THINK SIR YOU WILL NOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY WITHOUT VISITING ME
3379-132592-0064 IT IS UNNECESSARY TO SAY WITH WHAT PLEASURE I SHOULD RECEIVE YOU AND THE LADY BLANCHE I DO NOT DOUBT IT REPLIED THE COUNT AND I WILL NOT DENY MYSELF AND BLANCHE THE PLEASURE OF VISITING YOU
3379-132592-0065 ABOUT THE TIME WHEN WE CAN MEET YOU THERE WHEN EMILY SAID THAT SHE SHOULD HOPE TO SEE THE COUNTESS ALSO SHE WAS NOT SORRY TO LEARN THAT THIS LADY WAS GOING ACCOMPANIED BY MADEMOISELLE BEARN TO PAY A VISIT FOR A FEW WEEKS
3379-132592-0066 TO A FAMILY IN LOWER LANGUEDOC THE COUNT AFTER SOME FURTHER CONVERSATION ON HIS INTENDED JOURNEY AND ON THE ARRANGEMENT OF EMILY'S TOOK LEAVE AND MANY DAYS DID NOT SUCCEED THIS VISIT
3379-132592-0067 AND HAVING TAKEN AN AFFECTING LEAVE OF THE COUNT'S FAMILY IN WHICH M DU PONT WAS STILL INCLUDED AND OF HER FRIENDS AT THE CONVENT
3379-132592-0068 ATTENDED BY THE UNHAPPY ANNETTE
