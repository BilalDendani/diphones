549-126410-0000 CHAPTER NINE GROWN UP CYRIL HAD ONCE POINTED OUT THAT ORDINARY LIFE IS FULL OF OCCASIONS ON WHICH A WISH WOULD BE MOST USEFUL
549-126410-0001 AND THIS THOUGHT FILLED HIS MIND WHEN HE HAPPENED TO WAKE EARLY ON THE MORNING AFTER THE MORNING AFTER ROBERT HAD WISHED TO BE BIGGER THAN THE BAKER'S BOY AND HAD BEEN IT THE DAY THAT LAY BETWEEN THESE TWO DAYS HAD BEEN OCCUPIED ENTIRELY BY GETTING THE GOVERNESS CART HOME FROM BENENHURST
549-126410-0002 CYRIL DRESSED HASTILY HE DID NOT TAKE A BATH BECAUSE TIN BATHS ARE SO NOISY AND HE HAD NO WISH TO ROUSE ROBERT AND HE SLIPPED OFF ALONE AS ANTHEA HAD ONCE DONE AND RAN THROUGH THE DEWY MORNING TO THE SAND PIT
549-126410-0003 IT REPLIED POLITELY AND NOW WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU IT SAID I SUPPOSE YOU'VE COME HERE SO EARLY TO ASK FOR SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF
549-126410-0004 NOW DO BE PERSUADED FOR YOUR OWN GOOD ASK FOR A GOOD FAT MEGATHERIUM AND HAVE DONE WITH IT THANK YOU NOT TO DAY I THINK SAID CYRIL CAUTIOUSLY WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO SAY WAS YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE ALWAYS WISHING FOR THINGS WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING AT ANYTHING
549-126410-0005 I SELDOM PLAY
549-126410-0006 WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN CYRIL WENT ON IMPATIENTLY WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS
549-126410-0007 AND JUST WHERE WE HAPPEN TO BE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO COME AND DISTURB YOU AGAIN ADDED THE CRAFTY CYRIL IT'LL ONLY END IN YOUR WISHING FOR SOMETHING YOU DON'T REALLY WANT LIKE YOU DID ABOUT THE CASTLE
549-126410-0008 IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME SINCE PEOPLE LEFT OFF EATING REALLY WHOLESOME THINGS HOWEVER HAVE IT YOUR OWN WAY GOOD BYE GOOD BYE SAID CYRIL POLITELY I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
549-126410-0009 SHOOTING OUT ITS LONG SNAIL'S EYES I'M GETTING TIRED OF YOU ALL OF YOU YOU HAVE NO MORE SENSE THAN SO MANY OYSTERS GO ALONG WITH YOU AND CYRIL WENT WHAT AN AWFUL LONG TIME BABIES STAY BABIES
549-126410-0010 SAID CYRIL AFTER THE LAMB HAD TAKEN HIS WATCH OUT OF HIS POCKET WHILE HE WASN'T NOTICING AND WITH COOS AND CLUCKS OF NAUGHTY RAPTURE HAD OPENED THE CASE AND USED THE WHOLE THING AS A GARDEN SPADE
549-126410-0011 AND WHEN EVEN IMMERSION IN A WASH HAND BASIN HAD FAILED TO WASH THE MOULD FROM THE WORKS AND MAKE THE WATCH GO AGAIN CYRIL HAD SAID SEVERAL THINGS IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT BUT NOW HE WAS CALMER AND HAD EVEN CONSENTED TO CARRY THE LAMB PART OF THE WAY TO THE WOODS
549-126410-0012 CYRIL HAD PERSUADED THE OTHERS TO AGREE TO HIS PLAN AND NOT TO WISH FOR ANYTHING MORE TILL THEY REALLY DID WISH IT MEANTIME IT SEEMED GOOD TO GO TO THE WOODS FOR NUTS AND ON THE MOSSY GRASS UNDER A SWEET CHESTNUT TREE THE FIVE WERE SITTING
549-126410-0013 THE LAMB WAS PULLING UP THE MOSS BY FAT HANDFULS AND CYRIL WAS GLOOMILY CONTEMPLATING THE RUINS OF HIS WATCH HE DOES GROW SAID ANTHEA DOESN'T OO PRECIOUS ME GROW
549-126410-0014 AN IMAGINATION OR VOCABULARY GAVE OUT HERE BUT ANYWAY IT WAS THE LONGEST SPEECH THE LAMB HAD EVER MADE AND IT CHARMED EVERYONE EVEN CYRIL WHO TUMBLED THE LAMB OVER AND ROLLED HIM IN THE MOSS TO THE MUSIC OF DELIGHTED SQUEALS
549-126410-0015 I SUPPOSE HE'LL BE GROWN UP SOME DAY ANTHEA WAS SAYING DREAMILY LOOKING UP AT THE BLUE OF THE SKY THAT SHOWED BETWEEN THE LONG STRAIGHT CHESTNUT LEAVES BUT AT THAT MOMENT THE LAMB
549-126410-0016 THERE WAS A CRACK THE INNOCENT LAMB HAD BROKEN THE GLASS OF FATHER'S SECOND BEST WATERBURY WATCH WHICH CYRIL HAD BORROWED WITHOUT LEAVE GROW UP SOME DAY SAID CYRIL BITTERLY PLUMPING THE LAMB DOWN ON THE GRASS I DARESAY HE WILL WHEN NOBODY WANTS HIM TO
549-126410-0017 I WISH TO GOODNESS HE WOULD OH TAKE CARE CRIED ANTHEA IN AN AGONY OF APPREHENSION BUT IT WAS TOO LATE LIKE MUSIC TO A SONG HER WORDS AND CYRIL'S CAME OUT TOGETHER ANTHEA OH TAKE CARE CYRIL GROW UP NOW
549-126410-0018 AND THERE BEFORE THE HORRIFIED EYES OF ITS BROTHERS AND SISTERS THE LAMB SUDDENLY AND VIOLENTLY GREW UP IT WAS THE MOST TERRIBLE MOMENT THE CHANGE WAS NOT SO SUDDEN AS THE WISH CHANGES USUALLY WERE THE BABY'S FACE CHANGED FIRST
549-126410-0019 IT GREW THINNER AND LARGER LINES CAME IN THE FOREHEAD THE EYES GREW MORE DEEP SET AND DARKER IN COLOUR THE MOUTH GREW LONGER AND THINNER MOST TERRIBLE OF ALL A LITTLE DARK MOUSTACHE APPEARED ON THE LIP OF ONE WHO WAS STILL EXCEPT AS TO THE FACE
549-126410-0020 A TWO YEAR OLD BABY IN A LINEN SMOCK AND WHITE OPEN WORK SOCKS OH I WISH IT WOULDN'T OH I WISH IT WOULDN'T YOU BOYS MIGHT WISH AS WELL THEY ALL WISHED HARD FOR THE SIGHT WAS ENOUGH TO DISMAY THE MOST HEARTLESS
549-126410-0021 THEY ALL WISHED SO HARD INDEED THAT THEY FELT QUITE GIDDY AND ALMOST LOST CONSCIOUSNESS BUT THE WISHING WAS QUITE VAIN FOR WHEN THE WOOD CEASED TO WHIRL ROUND THEIR DAZZLED EYES WERE RIVETED AT ONCE BY THE SPECTACLE OF A VERY PROPER LOOKING YOUNG MAN IN FLANNELS AND A STRAW HAT
549-126410-0022 A YOUNG MAN WHO WORE THE SAME LITTLE BLACK MOUSTACHE WHICH JUST BEFORE THEY HAD ACTUALLY SEEN GROWING UPON THE BABY'S LIP THIS THEN WAS THE LAMB GROWN UP THEIR OWN LAMB IT WAS A TERRIBLE MOMENT
549-126410-0023 THE GROWN UP LAMB MOVED GRACEFULLY ACROSS THE MOSS AND SETTLED HIMSELF AGAINST THE TRUNK OF THE SWEET CHESTNUT HE TILTED THE STRAW HAT OVER HIS EYES HE WAS EVIDENTLY WEARY HE WAS GOING TO SLEEP THE LAMB THE ORIGINAL LITTLE TIRESOME BELOVED LAMB
549-126410-0024 OR HAD HIS MIND GROWN UP TOGETHER WITH HIS BODY THAT WAS THE QUESTION WHICH THE OTHERS IN A HURRIED COUNCIL HELD AMONG THE YELLOWING BRACKEN A FEW YARDS FROM THE SLEEPER DEBATED EAGERLY WHICHEVER IT IS IT'LL BE JUST AS AWFUL SAID ANTHEA IF HIS INSIDE SENSES ARE GROWN UP TOO
549-126410-0025 HE WON'T STAND OUR LOOKING AFTER HIM AND IF HE'S STILL A BABY INSIDE OF HIM HOW ON EARTH ARE WE TO GET HIM TO DO ANYTHING AND IT'LL BE GETTING ON FOR DINNER TIME IN A MINUTE
549-126410-0026 SAID JANE OH BOTHER NUTS SAID ROBERT BUT DINNER'S DIFFERENT
549-126410-0027 A FAT LOT OF DINNER WE SHOULD GET IF WE WENT BACK WITHOUT THE LAMB SAID CYRIL IN SCORNFUL MISERY AND IT'LL BE JUST THE SAME IF WE GO BACK WITH HIM IN THE STATE HE IS NOW YES I KNOW IT'S MY DOING DON'T RUB IT IN I KNOW I'M A BEAST AND NOT FIT TO LIVE
549-126410-0028 YOU CAN TAKE THAT FOR SETTLED AND SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
549-126410-0029 TAKE HIM REPEATED CYRIL YES DO IT'S ALL MY FAULT I DON'T DENY THAT BUT YOU'LL FIND YOU'VE GOT YOUR WORK CUT OUT FOR YOU IF YOU TRY TO TAKE THAT YOUNG MAN ANYWHERE THE LAMB ALWAYS WAS SPOILT BUT NOW HE'S GROWN UP HE'S A DEMON SIMPLY
549-126410-0030 WELL THEN SAID ROBERT LET'S WAKE HIM UP AND SEE WHAT HE'LL DO PERHAPS HE'LL TAKE US TO MAIDSTONE AND STAND SAM HE OUGHT TO HAVE A LOT OF MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF THOSE EXTRA SPECIAL BAGS WE MUST HAVE DINNER ANYWAY THEY DREW LOTS WITH LITTLE BITS OF BRACKEN
549-126410-0031 IT FELL TO JANE'S LOT TO WAKEN THE GROWN UP LAMB SHE DID IT GENTLY BY TICKLING HIS NOSE WITH A TWIG OF WILD HONEYSUCKLE HE SAID
549-126410-0032 TWICE AND THEN OPENED HIS EYES
549-126410-0033 WHAT'S THE GIDDY HOUR YOU'LL BE LATE FOR YOUR GRUB I KNOW WE SHALL SAID ROBERT BITTERLY THEN CUT ALONG HOME SAID THE GROWN UP LAMB WHAT ABOUT YOUR GRUB THOUGH ASKED JANE
549-126410-0034 BLANK MISERY FELL LIKE A PALL ON THE FOUR OTHERS THE LAMB
549-126410-0035 PERHAPS HE WOULD ALSO HAVE TEA THERE PERHAPS SUNSET WOULD COME UPON HIM AMID THE DAZZLING LUXURY OF CLUB LAND AND A HELPLESS CROSS SLEEPY BABY WOULD FIND ITSELF ALONE AMID UNSYMPATHETIC WAITERS AND WOULD WAIL MISERABLY FOR PANTY FROM THE DEPTHS OF A CLUB ARM CHAIR
549-126410-0036 THE PICTURE MOVED ANTHEA ALMOST TO TEARS OH NO LAMB DUCKY YOU MUSTN'T DO THAT SHE CRIED INCAUTIOUSLY THE GROWN UP LAMB FROWNED MY DEAR ANTHEA HE SAID
549-126410-0037 A RELIC OF FOOLISH AND FAR OFF CHILDHOOD THIS WAS AWFUL HE WAS THEIR ELDER BROTHER NOW WAS HE WELL OF COURSE HE WAS IF HE WAS GROWN UP SINCE THEY WEREN'T THUS
549-126410-0038 WERE MAKING THE CHILDREN WISE BEYOND THEIR YEARS DEAR HILARY SAID ANTHEA

549-126410-0040 AND WE'LL GO ON THE RIVER AFTERWARDS I'M INFINITELY OBLIGED TO YOU SAID THE LAMB COURTEOUSLY BUT I SHOULD PREFER SOLITUDE GO HOME TO YOUR LUNCH I MEAN YOUR DINNER PERHAPS I MAY LOOK IN ABOUT TEA TIME
549-126410-0041 THEIR BEDS SPEAKING GLANCES FLASHED BETWEEN THE WRETCHED FOUR MUCH BED THERE WOULD BE FOR THEM IF THEY WENT HOME WITHOUT THE LAMB WE PROMISED MOTHER NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF YOU IF WE TOOK YOU OUT
549-126410-0042 LOOK HERE JANE SAID THE GROWN UP LAMB
549-126410-0043 LITTLE GIRLS SHOULD BE SEEN AND NOT HEARD YOU KIDS MUST LEARN NOT TO MAKE YOURSELVES A NUISANCE RUN ALONG HOME NOW AND PERHAPS IF YOU'RE GOOD I'LL GIVE YOU EACH A PENNY TO MORROW LOOK HERE SAID CYRIL IN THE BEST MAN TO MAN TONE AT HIS COMMAND
549-126410-0044 WHERE ARE YOU GOING OLD MAN YOU MIGHT LET BOBS AND ME COME WITH YOU EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT THE GIRLS THIS WAS REALLY RATHER NOBLE OF CYRIL
549-126410-0045 WHO OF COURSE AFTER SUNSET WOULD BE A BABY AGAIN THE MAN TO MAN TONE SUCCEEDED I SHALL JUST RUN OVER TO MAIDSTONE ON MY BIKE SAID THE NEW LAMB AIRILY FINGERING THE LITTLE BLACK MOUSTACHE I CAN LUNCH AT THE CROWN AND PERHAPS I'LL HAVE A PULL ON THE RIVER
549-126410-0046 RUN ALONG HOME LIKE GOOD CHILDREN THE POSITION WAS DESPERATE
549-126410-0047 ANTHEA DETACHED A PIN FROM HER WAISTBAND A PIN WHOSE WITHDRAWAL LEFT A GAPING CHASM BETWEEN SKIRT AND BODICE AND HANDED IT FURTIVELY TO ROBERT WITH A GRIMACE OF THE DARKEST AND DEEPEST MEANING ROBERT SLIPPED AWAY TO THE ROAD
549-126410-0048 OF COURSE ROBERT UNDERSTOOD AT ONCE THAT IF THE LAMB WAS GROWN UP HE MUST HAVE A BICYCLE THIS HAD ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF ROBERT'S OWN REASONS FOR WISHING TO BE GROWN UP HE HASTILY BEGAN TO USE THE PIN ELEVEN PUNCTURES IN THE BACK TYRE SEVEN IN THE FRONT
549-126410-0049 WHICH WARNED HIM OF THE APPROACH OF THE OTHERS
549-126410-0050 YOUR BIKE'S RUN DOWN SAID ROBERT WONDERING HOW HE COULD SO SOON HAVE LEARNED TO DECEIVE SO IT IS SAID CYRIL IT'S A PUNCTURE SAID ANTHEA STOOPING DOWN AND STANDING UP AGAIN WITH A THORN WHICH SHE HAD GOT READY FOR THE PURPOSE LOOK HERE
549-126410-0051 THE GROWN UP LAMB OR HILARY AS I SUPPOSE ONE MUST NOW CALL HIM FIXED HIS PUMP AND BLEW UP THE TYRE THE PUNCTURED STATE OF IT WAS SOON EVIDENT I SUPPOSE THERE'S A COTTAGE SOMEWHERE NEAR WHERE ONE COULD GET A PAIL OF WATER SAID THE LAMB
549-126410-0052 THERE WAS AND WHEN THE NUMBER OF PUNCTURES HAD BEEN MADE MANIFEST IT WAS FELT TO BE A SPECIAL BLESSING THAT THE COTTAGE PROVIDED TEAS FOR CYCLISTS IT PROVIDED AN ODD SORT OF TEA AND HAMMY MEAL FOR THE LAMB AND HIS BROTHERS
549-126410-0053 THIS WAS PAID FOR OUT OF THE FIFTEEN SHILLINGS WHICH HAD BEEN EARNED BY ROBERT WHEN HE WAS A GIANT FOR THE LAMB IT APPEARED HAD UNFORTUNATELY NO MONEY ABOUT HIM THIS WAS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE OTHERS BUT IT IS A THING THAT WILL HAPPEN EVEN TO THE MOST GROWN UP OF US HOWEVER
549-126410-0054 ROBERT HAD ENOUGH TO EAT AND THAT WAS SOMETHING QUIETLY BUT PERSISTENTLY THE MISERABLE FOUR TOOK IT IN TURNS TO TRY TO PERSUADE THE LAMB OR SAINT MAUR TO SPEND THE REST OF THE DAY IN THE WOODS THERE WAS NOT VERY MUCH OF THE DAY LEFT BY THE TIME HE HAD MENDED THE EIGHTEENTH PUNCTURE
549-126410-0055 HE LOOKED UP FROM THE COMPLETED WORK WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF AND SUDDENLY PUT HIS TIE STRAIGHT THERE'S A LADY COMING HE SAID BRISKLY FOR GOODNESS SAKE GET OUT OF THE WAY GO HOME HIDE VANISH SOMEHOW I CAN'T BE SEEN WITH A PACK OF DIRTY KIDS
549-126410-0056 HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE INDEED RATHER DIRTY BECAUSE EARLIER IN THE DAY THE LAMB IN HIS INFANT STATE HAD SPRINKLED A GOOD DEAL OF GARDEN SOIL OVER THEM THE GROWN UP LAMB'S VOICE WAS SO TYRANT LIKE AS JANE SAID AFTERWARDS THAT THEY ACTUALLY RETREATED TO THE BACK GARDEN
549-126410-0057 AND LEFT HIM WITH HIS LITTLE MOUSTACHE AND HIS FLANNEL SUIT TO MEET ALONE THE YOUNG LADY WHO NOW CAME UP THE FRONT GARDEN WHEELING A BICYCLE THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE CAME OUT AND THE YOUNG LADY SPOKE TO HER
549-126410-0058 AND THE CHILDREN COULD NOT HEAR WHAT SHE SAID THOUGH THEY WERE CRANING ROUND THE CORNER BY THE PIG PAIL AND LISTENING WITH ALL THEIR EARS THEY FELT IT TO BE PERFECTLY FAIR AS ROBERT SAID WITH THAT WRETCHED LAMB IN THAT CONDITION WHEN THE LAMB SPOKE IN A LANGUID VOICE HEAVY WITH POLITENESS THEY HEARD WELL ENOUGH
549-126410-0059 A PUNCTURE HE WAS SAYING CAN I NOT BE OF ANY ASSISTANCE IF YOU COULD ALLOW ME THERE WAS A STIFLED EXPLOSION OF LAUGHTER BEHIND THE PIG PAIL THE GROWN UP LAMB OTHERWISE DEVEREUX TURNED THE TAIL OF AN ANGRY EYE IN ITS DIRECTION
549-126410-0060 YOU'RE VERY KIND SAID THE LADY LOOKING AT THE LAMB SHE LOOKED RATHER SHY BUT AS THE BOYS PUT IT THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY NONSENSE ABOUT HER BUT OH WHISPERED CYRIL BEHIND THE PIG PAIL I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE'D HAD ENOUGH BICYCLE MENDING FOR ONE DAY
549-126410-0061 AND IF SHE ONLY KNEW THAT REALLY AND TRULY HE'S ONLY A WHINY PINY SILLY LITTLE BABY HE'S NOT ANTHEA MURMURED ANGRILY HE'S A DEAR IF PEOPLE ONLY LET HIM ALONE IT'S OUR OWN PRECIOUS LAMB STILL WHATEVER SILLY IDIOTS MAY TURN HIM INTO ISN'T HE PUSSY
549-126410-0062 JANE DOUBTFULLY SUPPOSED SO NOW THE LAMB WHOM I MUST TRY TO REMEMBER TO CALL SAINT MAUR WAS EXAMINING THE LADY'S BICYCLE AND TALKING TO HER WITH A VERY GROWN UP MANNER INDEED NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE SUPPOSED TO SEE AND HEAR HIM
549-126410-0063 THAT ONLY THAT VERY MORNING HE HAD BEEN A CHUBBY CHILD OF TWO YEARS BREAKING OTHER PEOPLE'S WATERBURY WATCHES DEVEREUX AS HE OUGHT TO BE CALLED FOR THE FUTURE TOOK OUT A GOLD WATCH WHEN HE HAD MENDED THE LADY'S BICYCLE AND ALL THE ONLOOKERS BEHIND THE PIG PAIL SAID OH
549-126410-0064 BECAUSE IT SEEMED SO UNFAIR THAT THE BABY WHO HAD ONLY THAT MORNING DESTROYED TWO CHEAP BUT HONEST WATCHES SHOULD NOW IN THE GROWN UPNESS CYRIL'S FOLLY HAD RAISED HIM TO HAVE A REAL GOLD WATCH WITH A CHAIN AND SEALS HILARY AS I WILL NOW TERM HIM
549-126410-0065 WITHERED HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WITH A GLANCE AND THEN SAID TO THE LADY WITH WHOM HE SEEMED TO BE QUITE FRIENDLY IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME I WILL RIDE WITH YOU AS FAR AS THE CROSS ROADS IT IS GETTING LATE AND THERE ARE TRAMPS ABOUT
549-126410-0066 NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW WHAT ANSWER THE YOUNG LADY INTENDED TO GIVE TO THIS GALLANT OFFER FOR DIRECTLY ANTHEA HEARD IT MADE SHE RUSHED OUT KNOCKING AGAINST THE PIG PAIL
549-126410-0067 AND CAUGHT THE LAMB I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO SAY HILARY BY THE ARM THE OTHERS FOLLOWED AND IN AN INSTANT THE FOUR DIRTY CHILDREN WERE VISIBLE BEYOND DISGUISE DON'T LET HIM SAID ANTHEA TO THE LADY AND SHE SPOKE WITH INTENSE EARNESTNESS HE'S NOT FIT TO GO WITH ANYONE
549-126410-0068 GO AWAY LITTLE GIRL SAID SAINT MAUR AS WE WILL NOW CALL HIM IN A TERRIBLE VOICE GO HOME AT ONCE YOU'D MUCH BETTER NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM THE NOW RECKLESS ANTHEA WENT ON HE DOESN'T KNOW WHO HE IS HE'S SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU THINK HE IS
549-126410-0069 ASKED THE LADY NOT UNNATURALLY WHILE DEVEREUX AS I MUST TERM THE GROWN UP LAMB TRIED VAINLY TO PUSH ANTHEA AWAY THE OTHERS BACKED HER UP AND SHE STOOD SOLID AS A ROCK YOU JUST LET HIM GO WITH YOU SAID ANTHEA YOU'LL SOON SEE WHAT I MEAN
549-126410-0070 HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SUDDENLY SEE A POOR LITTLE HELPLESS BABY SPINNING ALONG DOWNHILL BESIDE YOU WITH ITS FEET UP ON A BICYCLE IT HAD LOST CONTROL OF THE LADY HAD TURNED RATHER PALE WHO ARE THESE VERY DIRTY CHILDREN SHE ASKED THE GROWN UP LAMB
549-126410-0071 SOMETIMES CALLED SAINT MAUR IN THESE PAGES I DON'T KNOW HE LIED MISERABLY
549-126410-0072 SHE EXPLAINED TURNING TO THE LADY WHO WITH TREMBLING HANDS WAS NOW TURNING HER BICYCLE TOWARDS THE GATE AND WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF HIM AND WE MUST GET HIM HOME BEFORE SUNSET OR I DON'T KNOW WHATEVER WILL BECOME OF US YOU SEE HE'S SORT OF UNDER A SPELL ENCHANTED YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
549-126410-0073 AGAIN AND AGAIN THE LAMB DEVEREUX I MEAN HAD TRIED TO STOP JANE'S ELOQUENCE BUT ROBERT AND CYRIL HELD HIM ONE BY EACH LEG AND NO PROPER EXPLANATION WAS POSSIBLE THE LADY RODE HASTILY AWAY
549-126410-0074 AND ELECTRIFIED HER RELATIVES AT DINNER BY TELLING THEM OF HER ESCAPE FROM A FAMILY OF DANGEROUS LUNATICS THE LITTLE GIRL'S EYES WERE SIMPLY THOSE OF A MANIAC I CAN'T THINK HOW SHE CAME TO BE AT LARGE SHE SAID WHEN HER BICYCLE HAD WHIZZED AWAY DOWN THE ROAD
549-126410-0075 CYRIL SPOKE GRAVELY HILARY OLD CHAP HE SAID YOU MUST HAVE HAD A SUNSTROKE OR SOMETHING AND THE THINGS YOU'VE BEEN SAYING TO THAT LADY WHY IF WE WERE TO TELL YOU THE THINGS YOU'VE SAID WHEN YOU ARE YOURSELF AGAIN SAY TO MORROW MORNING YOU WOULDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THEM LET ALONE BELIEVE THEM
549-126410-0076 YOU TRUST TO ME OLD CHAP AND COME HOME NOW AND IF YOU'RE NOT YOURSELF IN THE MORNING WE'LL ASK THE MILKMAN TO ASK THE DOCTOR TO COME THE POOR GROWN UP LAMB SAINT MAUR WAS REALLY ONE OF HIS CHRISTIAN NAMES SEEMED NOW TOO BEWILDERED TO RESIST
549-126410-0077 HE SAID BITTERLY I SUPPOSE I HAD BETTER TAKE YOU HOME BUT YOU'RE NOT TO SUPPOSE I SHALL PASS THIS OVER
549-126410-0078 YES YOU WILL MY LAMB SAID ANTHEA UNDER HER BREATH BUT IT WON'T BE AT ALL THE SORT OF THING YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IN HER HEART SHE COULD HEAR THE PRETTY SOFT LITTLE LOVING VOICE OF THE BABY LAMB SO DIFFERENT FROM THE AFFECTED TONES OF THE DREADFUL GROWN UP LAMB
549-126410-0079 ONE OF WHOSE NAMES WAS DEVEREUX SAYING ME LOVE PANTY WANTS TO COME TO OWN PANTY OH LET'S GET HOME FOR GOODNESS SAKE SHE SAID YOU SHALL SAY WHATEVER YOU LIKE IN THE MORNING IF YOU CAN SHE ADDED IN A WHISPER
549-126410-0080 IT WAS A GLOOMY PARTY THAT WENT HOME THROUGH THE SOFT EVENING DURING ANTHEA'S REMARKS ROBERT HAD AGAIN MADE PLAY WITH THE PIN AND THE BICYCLE TYRE AND THE LAMB WHOM THEY HAD TO CALL SAINT MAUR OR DEVEREUX OR HILARY
549-126410-0081 SO THE MACHINE WAS WHEELED THE SUN WAS JUST ON THE POINT OF SETTING WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE WHITE HOUSE THE FOUR ELDER CHILDREN WOULD HAVE LIKED TO LINGER IN THE LANE TILL THE COMPLETE SUNSETTING TURNED THE GROWN UP LAMB WHOSE CHRISTIAN NAMES I WILL NOT FURTHER WEARY YOU BY REPEATING
549-126410-0082 INTO THEIR OWN DEAR TIRESOME BABY BROTHER BUT HE IN HIS GROWN UPNESS INSISTED ON GOING ON AND THUS HE WAS MET IN THE FRONT GARDEN BY MARTHA NOW YOU REMEMBER THAT AS A SPECIAL FAVOUR
549-126410-0083 BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE WISHES OF THE CHILDREN THEREFORE MARTHA MERELY SAW THE USUAL PARTY WITH THE BABY LAMB ABOUT WHOM SHE HAD BEEN DESPERATELY ANXIOUS ALL THE AFTERNOON TROTTING BESIDE ANTHEA ON FAT BABY LEGS WHILE THE CHILDREN OF COURSE STILL SAW THE GROWN UP LAMB
549-126410-0084 NEVER MIND WHAT NAMES HE WAS CHRISTENED BY AND MARTHA RUSHED AT HIM AND CAUGHT HIM IN HER ARMS EXCLAIMING COME TO HIS OWN MARTHA THEN A PRECIOUS POPPET THE GROWN UP LAMB WHOSE NAMES SHALL NOW BE BURIED IN OBLIVION STRUGGLED FURIOUSLY
549-126410-0085 AN EXPRESSION OF INTENSE HORROR AND ANNOYANCE WAS SEEN ON HIS FACE BUT MARTHA WAS STRONGER THAN HE SHE LIFTED HIM UP AND CARRIED HIM INTO THE HOUSE NONE OF THE CHILDREN WILL EVER FORGET THAT PICTURE
549-126410-0086 THE NEAT GREY FLANNEL SUITED GROWN UP YOUNG MAN WITH THE GREEN TIE AND THE LITTLE BLACK MOUSTACHE FORTUNATELY HE WAS SLIGHTLY BUILT AND NOT TALL STRUGGLING IN THE STURDY ARMS OF MARTHA WHO BORE HIM AWAY HELPLESS IMPLORING HIM AS SHE WENT TO BE A GOOD BOY NOW
549-126410-0087 AND COME AND HAVE HIS NICE BREMMILK FORTUNATELY THE SUN SET AS THEY REACHED THE DOORSTEP THE BICYCLE DISAPPEARED AND MARTHA WAS SEEN TO CARRY INTO THE HOUSE THE REAL LIVE DARLING SLEEPY TWO YEAR OLD LAMB THE GROWN UP LAMB NAMELESS HENCE FORTH
549-126410-0088 WAS GONE FOR EVER FOR EVER SAID CYRIL BECAUSE AS SOON AS EVER THE LAMB'S OLD ENOUGH TO BE BULLIED WE MUST JOLLY WELL BEGIN TO BULLY HIM FOR HIS OWN SAKE SO THAT HE MAYN'T GROW UP LIKE THAT YOU SHAN'T BULLY HIM SAID ANTHEA STOUTLY
549-126410-0089 NOT IF I CAN STOP IT WE MUST TAME HIM BY KINDNESS SAID JANE YOU SEE SAID ROBERT IF HE GROWS UP IN THE USUAL WAY
549-126410-0090 THE AWFUL THING TO DAY WAS HIS GROWING UP SO SUDDENLY THERE WAS NO TIME TO IMPROVE HIM AT ALL HE DOESN'T WANT ANY IMPROVING SAID ANTHEA AS THE VOICE OF THE LAMB CAME COOING THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR JUST AS SHE HAD HEARD IT IN HER HEART THAT AFTERNOON
