4576-66275-0017 OR EVER THEY CAME TO THE WATER'S EDGE THEY WERE MET BY WOLFKETTLE OF THE WOLFINGS AND HIARANDI OF THE ELKINGS AND THREE OTHERS WHO WERE BUT JUST COME FROM THE PLACE WHERE THE HURT MEN LAY DOWN IN A DALE NEAR THE GREAT RIDGE
4576-66275-0018 THERE HAD WOLFKETTLE AND HIARANDI BEEN TENDING TOTI OF THE BEAMINGS THEIR FELLOW IN ARMS WHO HAD BEEN SORELY HURT IN THE BATTLE BUT WAS DOING WELL AND WAS LIKE TO LIVE SO WHEN THEY SAW THE MESSENGERS THEY CAME UP TO THEM AND HAILED THEM AND ASKED THEM
4576-66275-0019 IF THE TIDINGS WERE GOOD OR EVIL
4576-66275-0020 SAID WOLFKETTLE WE WILL LEAD YOU TO HIM HE IS ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE WATER WITH ALL HIS HOST AND THEY ARE HARD ON DEPARTING SO THEY WENT DOWN THE FORD WHICH WAS NOT VERY DEEP AND WOLFKETTLE RODE THE FORD BEHIND GEIRBALD
4576-66275-0021 AND ANOTHER MAN BEHIND VIGLUND BUT HIARANDI WENT AFOOT WITH THE OTHERS BESIDE THE HORSES FOR HE WAS A VERY TALL MAN
4576-66275-0022 BUT AS THEY RODE AMIDST THE CLEAR WATER WOLFKETTLE LIFTED UP HIS VOICE AND SANG WHITE HORSE WITH WHAT ARE YE LADEN AS YE WADE THE SHALLOWS WARM BUT WITH TIDINGS OF THE BATTLE AND THE FEAR OF THE FATEFUL STORM
4576-66275-0023 AND THE FACE OF THE KITE'S NEST SHOWED PALE AND AWFUL AGAINST A DARK STEELY CLOUD AND A FEW DROPS OF RAIN PATTERED INTO THE SMOOTH WATER BEFORE THEM FROM A RAG OF THE CLOUD FLOCK RIGHT OVER HEAD THEY WERE IN MID STREAM NOW
4576-66275-0024 AND WOULD FAIN KNOW ON WHAT ERRAND THOSE WERE COME
4576-66275-0025 AND TURN THY FACE FROM BEHOLDING THE SHOCK OF GUILT WITH GUILT STAND STILL O BLOOD OF SUMMER AND LET THE HARVEST FADE TILL THERE BE NOUGHT BUT FALLOW
4576-66275-0026 IF IT BE BUT ENOUGH FOR OUR EYEN TO SEE THE ROAD OF FIGHT
4576-66275-0027 TILL THE JOY OF OUR HEARTS IN BATTLE BRING BACK THE DAY AGAIN AS HE SPAKE THAT WORD
4576-66275-0028 AND THEY AND THE MEN WHO ABODE THEM ON THE BANK SHOUTED TOGETHER FOR JOY OF FELLOWSHIP AND ALL TOSSED ALOFT THEIR WEAPONS THE MAN WHO HAD RIDDEN BEHIND VIGLUND SLIPPED OFF ON TO THE GROUND BUT WOLFKETTLE ABODE IN HIS PLACE BEHIND GEIRBALD
4576-66275-0029 SO THE MESSENGERS PASSED ON AND THE OTHERS CLOSED UP ROUND ABOUT THEM
4576-66275-0030 ON A ROCK BENEATH A SOLE ASH TREE THE FACE OF THE KITE'S NEST RISING BEHIND HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A BIGHT OF THE RIVER THERE HE SAT UNHELMED WITH THE DWARF WROUGHT HAUBERK ABOUT HIM
4576-66275-0031 HOLDING THRONG PLOUGH IN ITS SHEATH ACROSS HIS KNEES WHILE HE GAVE WORD TO THIS AND THAT MAN CONCERNING THE ORDER OF THE HOST SO WHEN THEY WERE COME THITHER THE THRONG OPENED THAT THE MESSENGERS MIGHT COME FORWARD
4576-66275-0032 FOR BY THIS TIME HAD MANY MORE DRAWN NEAR TO HEARKEN WHAT WAS TOWARD THERE THEY SAT ON THEIR HORSES THE WHITE AND THE GREY AND WOLFKETTLE STOOD BY GEIRBALD'S BRIDLE REIN FOR HE HAD NOW LIGHTED DOWN AND A LITTLE BEHIND HIM HIS HEAD TOWERING OVER THE OTHERS
4576-66275-0033 THE RAGGED CLOUD HAD DRIFTED DOWN SOUTH EAST NOW AND THE RAIN FELL NO MORE BUT THE SUN WAS STILL PALE AND CLOUDED
4576-66275-0034 WHAT DO YE SONS OF THE WAR SHIELD WHAT TALE IS THERE TO TELL IS THE KINDRED FALLEN TANGLED IN THE GRASP OF THE FALLOW HELL CROWS THE RED COCK OVER THE HOMESTEADS HAVE WE MET THE FOE TOO LATE
4576-66275-0035 BECAUSE WE BEAR THE MESSAGE THAT THE BATTLE ROAD YE TAKE NOR TARRY FOR THE THUNDER OR THE COMING ON OF RAIN OR THE WINDY CLOUDY NIGHT TIDE LEST YOUR BATTLE BE BUT VAIN
4576-66275-0036 SEEK THOU THE TRAIL OF THE ALIENS OF THE CITIES OF THE SOUTH AND THOU SHALT FIND IT LEADING O'ER THE HEATHS TO THE BEECHEN WOOD AND THENCE TO THE STONY PLACES WHERE THE FOXES FIND THEIR FOOD
4576-66275-0037 SAID GEIRBALD WHEN LAST I LOOKED UPON OTTER ALL ARMED HE RODE THE PLAIN WITH HIS WHOLE HOST CLATTERING ROUND HIM LIKE THE RUSH OF THE SUMMER RAIN
4576-66275-0038 TO THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT THEY LOOKED NOT BUT THEY RODE THROUGH THE DUSK AND THE DARK BEHOLDING NOUGHT BEFORE THEM BUT THE DREAM OF THE FOES IN THE MARK SO HE WENT
4576-66275-0039 AND AGAIN IT SAITH O WAR DUKE SEEK THOU THE BEAR'S ABODE AND TARRY NEVER A MOMENT FOR OUGHT THAT SEEMS OF WORTH FOR THERE SHALL YE FIND THE SWORD EDGE AND THE FLAME OF THE FOES OF THE EARTH TARRY NOT THIODOLF NOR TURN ABACK
4576-66275-0040 THOUGH A NEW FOE FOLLOWETH ON THINE HEELS NO NEED TO QUESTION ME MORE I HAVE NO MORE TO TELL SAVE THAT A WOMAN BROUGHT THESE TIDINGS TO US WHOM THE HALL SUN HAD SENT WITH OTHERS TO WATCH THE WAYS AND SOME OF THEM HAD SEEN THE ROMANS
4576-66275-0041 BUT EACH MAN WENT ABOUT HIS BUSINESS OF LOOKING TO HIS WAR GEAR AND GATHERING TO THE APPOINTED PLACE OF HIS KINDRED
4576-66275-0042 WAS CLOSE AT HAND SO HE BADE HIM BLOW THE WAR BLAST AND ALL MEN KNEW THE MEANING OF THAT VOICE OF THE HORN AND EVERY MAN ARMED HIM IN HASTE AND THEY WHO HAD HORSES AND THESE WERE BUT THE BEARINGS AND THE WARNINGS SADDLED THEM AND MOUNTED
4576-66275-0043 AND FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH WENT THE WORD THAT THE ROMANS WERE GOTTEN INTO MID MARK AND WERE BURNING THE BEARING ABODES SO SPEEDILY WAS THE WHOLE HOST READY FOR THE WAY THE WOLFINGS AT THE HEAD OF ALL
4576-66275-0044 WHEN YE SHALL HOLD THE ALIENS AS THE FISHES IN THE NET ON THE RIDGE YE SLEW A MANY BUT THERE CAME A MANY MORE FROM THEIR STRONGHOLDS BY THE WATER TO THEIR NEW BUILT GARTH OF WAR
4576-66275-0045 AND ALL THESE HAVE BEEN LED BY DASTARDS O'ER THE WAY OUR FEET MUST TREAD
4576-66275-0046 BUT BELIKE THESE ARE BUT THE VISIONS THAT TO MANY A MAN SHALL COME WHEN HE GOETH ADOWN TO THE BATTLE AND BEFORE HIM RISETH HIGH THE WALL OF VALIANT FOEMEN TO HIDE ALL THINGS ANIGH
4576-66275-0047 THAT NO WORK THAT WE MAY WIN TO MORROW OR THE NEXT DAY SHALL QUENCH THE MARKMEN'S KIN ON MANY A DAY HEREAFTER SHALL THEIR WARRIORS CARRY SHIELD ON MANY A DAY THEIR MAIDENS SHALL DRIVE THE KINE AFIELD
4576-66275-0048 SO FELL THE WHOLE HOST INTO DUE ARRAY AND THEY WERE SOMEWHAT OVER THREE THOUSAND WARRIORS ALL GOOD AND TRIED MEN AND MEET TO FACE THE UTTERMOST OF BATTLE IN THE OPEN FIELD SO THEY WENT THEIR WAYS WITH ALL THE SPEED THAT FOOTMEN MAY
4576-66275-0049 AND IN FAIR ORDER AND THE SKY CLEARED ABOVE THEIR HEADS BUT THE DISTANT THUNDER STILL GROWLED ABOUT THE WORLD GEIRBALD AND VIGLUND JOINED THEMSELVES TO THE WOLFINGS AND WENT A FOOT ALONG WITH WOLFKETTLE
