4744-31668-0000 MISSUS BITTACY HAD NEVER LIKED THEIR PRESENT HOME SHE PREFERRED A FLAT MORE OPEN COUNTRY THAT LEFT APPROACHES CLEAR SHE LIKED TO SEE THINGS COMING THIS COTTAGE ON THE VERY EDGE OF THE OLD HUNTING GROUNDS OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR
4744-31668-0001 HAD NEVER SATISFIED HER IDEAL OF A SAFE AND PLEASANT PLACE TO SETTLE DOWN IN THE SEA COAST WITH TREELESS DOWNS BEHIND AND A CLEAR HORIZON IN FRONT AS AT EASTBOURNE SAY WAS HER IDEAL OF A PROPER HOME
4744-31668-0002 IT WAS CURIOUS THIS INSTINCTIVE AVERSION SHE FELT TO BEING SHUT IN BY TREES ESPECIALLY A KIND OF CLAUSTROPHOBIA ALMOST PROBABLY DUE AS HAS BEEN SAID TO THE DAYS IN INDIA WHEN THE TREES TOOK HER HUSBAND OFF AND SURROUNDED HIM WITH DANGERS
4744-31668-0003 IN THOSE WEEKS OF SOLITUDE THE FEELING HAD MATURED SHE HAD FOUGHT IT IN HER FASHION BUT NEVER CONQUERED IT APPARENTLY ROUTED IT HAD A WAY OF CREEPING BACK IN OTHER FORMS IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE YIELDING TO HIS STRONG DESIRE
4744-31668-0004 SHE THOUGHT THE BATTLE WON BUT THE TERROR OF THE TREES CAME BACK BEFORE THE FIRST MONTH HAD PASSED THEY LAUGHED IN HER FACE
4744-31668-0005 LAY ABOUT THEIR COTTAGE LIKE A MIGHTY WALL
4744-31668-0006 FAR FROM MORBID NATURALLY SHE DID HER BEST TO DENY THE THOUGHT AND SO SIMPLE AND UNARTIFICIAL WAS HER TYPE OF MIND THAT FOR WEEKS TOGETHER SHE WOULD WHOLLY LOSE IT THEN SUDDENLY IT WOULD RETURN UPON HER WITH A RUSH OF BLEAK REALITY
4744-31668-0007 IT WAS NOT ONLY IN HER MIND IT EXISTED APART FROM ANY MERE MOOD A SEPARATE FEAR THAT WALKED ALONE IT CAME AND WENT YET WHEN IT WENT WENT ONLY TO WATCH HER FROM ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW IT WAS IN ABEYANCE HIDDEN ROUND THE CORNER
4744-31668-0008 THE FOREST NEVER LET HER GO COMPLETELY IT WAS EVER READY TO ENCROACH ALL THE BRANCHES SHE SOMETIMES FANCIED STRETCHED ONE WAY TOWARDS THEIR TINY COTTAGE AND GARDEN AS THOUGH IT SOUGHT TO DRAW THEM IN AND MERGE THEM IN ITSELF
4744-31668-0009 ITS GREAT DEEP BREATHING SOUL RESENTED THE MOCKERY THE INSOLENCE THE IRRITATION OF THE PRIM GARDEN AT ITS VERY GATES IT WOULD ABSORB AND SMOTHER THEM IF IT COULD
4744-31668-0010 AND EVERY WIND THAT BLEW ITS THUNDERING MESSAGE OVER THE HUGE SOUNDING BOARD OF THE MILLION SHAKING TREES CONVEYED THE PURPOSE THAT IT HAD THEY HAD ANGERED ITS GREAT SOUL AT ITS HEART WAS THIS DEEP INCESSANT ROARING
4744-31668-0011 ALL THIS SHE NEVER FRAMED IN WORDS THE SUBTLETIES OF LANGUAGE LAY FAR BEYOND HER REACH BUT INSTINCTIVELY SHE FELT IT AND MORE BESIDES IT TROUBLED HER PROFOUNDLY CHIEFLY MOREOVER FOR HER HUSBAND
4744-31668-0012 MERELY FOR HERSELF THE NIGHTMARE MIGHT HAVE LEFT HER COLD IT WAS DAVID'S PECULIAR INTEREST IN THE TREES THAT GAVE THE SPECIAL INVITATION JEALOUSY THEN IN ITS MOST SUBTLE ASPECT CAME TO STRENGTHEN THIS AVERSION AND DISLIKE
4744-31668-0013 FOR IT CAME IN A FORM THAT NO REASONABLE WIFE COULD POSSIBLY OBJECT TO HER HUSBAND'S PASSION SHE REFLECTED WAS NATURAL AND INBORN IT HAD DECIDED HIS VOCATION FED HIS AMBITION NOURISHED HIS DREAMS DESIRES HOPES
4744-31668-0014 ALL HIS BEST YEARS OF ACTIVE LIFE HAD BEEN SPENT IN THE CARE AND GUARDIANSHIP OF TREES HE KNEW THEM UNDERSTOOD THEIR SECRET LIFE AND NATURE MANAGED THEM INTUITIVELY AS OTHER MEN MANAGED DOGS AND HORSES
4744-31668-0015 HE COULD NOT LIVE FOR LONG AWAY FROM THEM WITHOUT A STRANGE ACUTE NOSTALGIA THAT STOLE HIS PEACE OF MIND AND CONSEQUENTLY HIS STRENGTH OF BODY A FOREST MADE HIM HAPPY AND AT PEACE IT NURSED AND FED AND SOOTHED HIS DEEPEST MOODS
4744-31668-0016 TREES INFLUENCED THE SOURCES OF HIS LIFE LOWERED OR RAISED THE VERY HEART BEAT IN HIM CUT OFF FROM THEM HE LANGUISHED AS A LOVER OF THE SEA CAN DROOP INLAND OR A MOUNTAINEER MAY PINE IN THE FLAT MONOTONY OF THE PLAINS
4744-31668-0017 THIS SHE COULD UNDERSTAND IN A FASHION AT LEAST AND MAKE ALLOWANCES FOR SHE HAD YIELDED GENTLY EVEN SWEETLY TO HIS CHOICE OF THEIR ENGLISH HOME FOR IN THE LITTLE ISLAND THERE IS NOTHING THAT SUGGESTS THE WOODS OF WILDER COUNTRIES SO NEARLY AS THE NEW FOREST
4744-31668-0018 IT HAS THE GENUINE AIR AND MYSTERY THE DEPTH AND SPLENDOR THE LONELINESS AND THERE AND THERE THE STRONG UNTAMABLE QUALITY OF OLD TIME FORESTS AS BITTACY OF THE DEPARTMENT KNEW THEM IN A SINGLE DETAIL ONLY HAD HE YIELDED TO HER WISHES
4744-31668-0019 HE CONSENTED TO A COTTAGE ON THE EDGE INSTEAD OF IN THE HEART OF IT AND FOR A DOZEN YEARS NOW THEY HAD DWELT IN PEACE AND HAPPINESS AT THE LIPS OF THIS GREAT SPREADING THING THAT COVERED SO MANY LEAGUES WITH ITS TANGLE OF SWAMPS AND MOORS AND SPLENDID ANCIENT TREES
4744-31668-0020 ONLY WITH THE LAST TWO YEARS OR SO WITH HIS OWN INCREASING AGE AND PHYSICAL DECLINE PERHAPS HAD COME THIS MARKED GROWTH OF PASSIONATE INTEREST IN THE WELFARE OF THE FOREST
4744-31668-0021 THE SIGHT AND SOUND AND SMELL OF THEM BUT FOR HERSELF IT MEANT RELEASE FROM A HAUNTING DREAD ESCAPE TO RENOUNCE THOSE SIX WEEKS BY THE SEA ON THE SUNNY SHINING COAST OF FRANCE
4744-31668-0022 WAS ALMOST MORE THAN THIS LITTLE WOMAN EVEN WITH HER UNSELFISHNESS COULD FACE AFTER THE FIRST SHOCK OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT SHE REFLECTED AS DEEPLY AS HER NATURE PERMITTED
4744-31668-0023 DUTY SHE FELT CLEARLY POINTED TO RENOUNCEMENT THE DISCIPLINE WOULD CERTAINLY BE SEVERE SHE DID NOT DREAM AT THE MOMENT HOW SEVERE BUT THIS FINE CONSISTENT LITTLE CHRISTIAN SAW IT PLAIN SHE ACCEPTED IT TOO WITHOUT ANY SIGHING OF THE MARTYR
4744-31668-0024 THOUGH THE COURAGE SHE SHOWED WAS OF THE MARTYR ORDER HER HUSBAND SHOULD NEVER KNOW THE COST IN ALL BUT THIS ONE PASSION HIS UNSELFISHNESS WAS EVER AS GREAT AS HER OWN THE LOVE SHE HAD BORNE HIM ALL THESE YEARS
4744-31668-0025 LIKE THE LOVE SHE BORE HER ANTHROPOMORPHIC DEITY WAS DEEP AND REAL SHE LOVED TO SUFFER FOR THEM BOTH
4744-31668-0026 IT DID NOT TAKE THE FORM OF A MERE SELFISH PREDILECTION SOMETHING HIGHER THAN TWO WILLS IN CONFLICT SEEKING COMPROMISE WAS IN IT FROM THE BEGINNING I FEEL SOPHIA IT WOULD BE REALLY MORE THAN I COULD MANAGE
4744-31668-0027 MY DUTY AND MY HAPPINESS LIE HERE WITH THE FOREST AND WITH YOU MY LIFE IS DEEPLY ROOTED IN THIS PLACE SOMETHING I CAN'T DEFINE CONNECTS MY INNER BEING WITH THESE TREES AND SEPARATION WOULD MAKE ME ILL MIGHT EVEN KILL ME
4744-31668-0028 MY HOLD ON LIFE WOULD WEAKEN HERE IS MY SOURCE OF SUPPLY I CANNOT EXPLAIN IT BETTER THAN THAT HE LOOKED UP STEADILY INTO HER FACE ACROSS THE TABLE SO THAT SHE SAW THE GRAVITY OF HIS EXPRESSION AND THE SHINING OF HIS STEADY EYES
4744-31668-0029 DAVID YOU FEEL IT AS STRONGLY AS THAT SHE SAID FORGETTING THE TEA THINGS ALTOGETHER YES HE REPLIED I DO AND IT'S NOT OF THE BODY ONLY I FEEL IT IN MY SOUL
4744-31668-0030 SHE ALMOST FELT THE RUSH OF FOLIAGE IN THE WIND IT STOOD BETWEEN THEM THERE ARE THINGS SOME THINGS SHE FALTERED WE ARE NOT INTENDED TO KNOW I THINK THE WORDS EXPRESSED HER GENERAL ATTITUDE TO LIFE NOT ALONE TO THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT
4744-31668-0031 AND AFTER A PAUSE OF SEVERAL MINUTES DISREGARDING THE CRITICISM AS THOUGH HE HAD NOT HEARD IT I CANNOT EXPLAIN IT BETTER THAN THAT YOU SEE HIS GRAVE VOICE ANSWERED THERE IS THIS DEEP TREMENDOUS LINK SOME SECRET POWER THEY EMANATE THAT KEEPS ME WELL AND HAPPY
4744-31668-0032 AND ALIVE IF YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND I FEEL AT LEAST YOU MAY BE ABLE TO FORGIVE HIS TONE GREW TENDER GENTLE SOFT MY SELFISHNESS I KNOW MUST SEEM QUITE UNFORGIVABLE I CANNOT HELP IT SOMEHOW
4744-31668-0033 THESE TREES THIS ANCIENT FOREST BOTH SEEM KNITTED INTO ALL THAT MAKES ME LIVE AND IF I GO
4744-31668-0034 HE STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND SANK BACK IN HIS CHAIR
4744-31668-0035 WHILE SHE WENT OVER AND PUT HER ARMS ABOUT HIM MY DEAR SHE MURMURED GOD WILL DIRECT WE WILL ACCEPT HIS GUIDANCE HE HAS ALWAYS SHOWN THE WAY BEFORE MY SELFISHNESS AFFLICTS ME HE BEGAN BUT SHE WOULD NOT LET HIM FINISH
4744-31668-0036 SHE KISSED HIM SHE WOULD NOT LET HIM SPEAK HER HEART WAS IN HER THROAT AND SHE FELT FOR HIM FAR MORE THAN FOR HERSELF AND THEN HE HAD SUGGESTED THAT SHE SHOULD GO ALONE PERHAPS FOR A SHORTER TIME AND STAY IN HER BROTHER'S VILLA WITH THE CHILDREN ALICE AND STEPHEN
4744-31668-0037 YOU NEED IT AS MUCH AS I DREAD IT
4744-31668-0038 I CANNOT LEAVE THIS FOREST THAT I LOVE SO WELL I EVEN FEEL SOPHIE DEAR HE SAT UP STRAIGHT AND FACED HER AS HE HALF WHISPERED IT THAT I CAN NEVER LEAVE IT AGAIN MY LIFE AND HAPPINESS LIE HERE TOGETHER
4744-31668-0039 AND EVE WHILE SCORNING THE IDEA THAT SHE COULD LEAVE HIM ALONE WITH THE INFLUENCE OF THE FOREST ALL ABOUT HIM TO HAVE ITS UNIMPEDED WAY SHE FELT THE PANGS OF THAT SUBTLE JEALOUSY BITE KEEN AND CLOSE HE LOVED THE FOREST BETTER THAN HERSELF
4744-31668-0040 FOR HE PLACED IT FIRST BEHIND THE WORDS MOREOVER HID THE UNUTTERED THOUGHT THAT MADE HER SO UNEASY THE TERROR SANDERSON HAD BROUGHT REVIVED AND SHOOK ITS WINGS BEFORE HER VERY EYES
4744-31668-0041 THAT WHILE HE COULD NOT SPARE THE TREES THEY EQUALLY COULD NOT SPARE HIM THE VIVIDNESS WITH WHICH HE MANAGED TO CONCEAL AND YET BETRAY THE FACT BROUGHT A PROFOUND DISTRESS THAT CROSSED THE BORDER BETWEEN PRESENTIMENT AND WARNING INTO POSITIVE ALARM
4744-31668-0042 THE TREES HE TENDED GUARDED WATCHED OVER LOVED DAVID I SHALL STAY HERE WITH YOU I THINK YOU NEED ME REALLY DON'T YOU EAGERLY WITH A TOUCH OF HEART FELT PASSION THE WORDS POURED OUT NOW MORE THAN EVER DEAR
4744-31668-0043 GOD BLESS YOU FOR YOU SWEET UNSELFISHNESS AND YOUR SACRIFICE HE ADDED IS ALL THE GREATER BECAUSE YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE THING THAT MAKES IT NECESSARY FOR ME TO STAY PERHAPS IN THE SPRING INSTEAD SHE SAID WITH A TREMOR IN THE VOICE
4744-31668-0044 IN THE SPRING PERHAPS HE ANSWERED GENTLY ALMOST BENEATH HIS BREATH FOR THEY WILL NOT NEED ME THEN ALL THE WORLD CAN LOVE THEM IN THE SPRING
4744-31668-0045 I WISH TO STAY WITH THEM PARTICULARLY THEN I EVEN FEEL I OUGHT TO AND I MUST AND IN THIS WAY WITHOUT FURTHER SPEECH THE DECISION WAS MADE MISSUS BITTACY AT LEAST ASKED NO MORE QUESTIONS YET SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO SHOW MORE SYMPATHY THAN WAS NECESSARY
