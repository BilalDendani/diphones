7117-86732-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT THE PRISON REGISTER THE DAY AFTER THAT IN WHICH THE SCENE WE HAVE JUST DESCRIBED HAD TAKEN PLACE ON THE ROAD BETWEEN BELLEGARDE AND BEAUCAIRE A MAN OF ABOUT THIRTY OR TWO AND THIRTY
7117-86732-0001 DRESSED IN A BRIGHT BLUE FROCK COAT NANKEEN TROUSERS AND A WHITE WAISTCOAT HAVING THE APPEARANCE AND ACCENT OF AN ENGLISHMAN PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE THE MAYOR OF MARSEILLES SIR SAID HE
7117-86732-0002 I AM CHIEF CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH OF ROME WE ARE AND HAVE BEEN THESE TEN YEARS CONNECTED WITH THE HOUSE OF MORREL AND SON OF MARSEILLES WE HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS OR THEREABOUTS LOANED ON THEIR SECURITIES
7117-86732-0003 AND WE ARE A LITTLE UNEASY AT REPORTS THAT HAVE REACHED US THAT THE FIRM IS ON THE BRINK OF RUIN I HAVE COME THEREFORE EXPRESS FROM ROME TO ASK YOU FOR INFORMATION SIR REPLIED THE MAYOR
7117-86732-0004 HE HAS LOST FOUR OR FIVE VESSELS AND SUFFERED BY THREE OR FOUR BANKRUPTCIES BUT IT IS NOT FOR ME ALTHOUGH I AM A CREDITOR MYSELF TO THE AMOUNT OF TEN THOUSAND FRANCS TO GIVE ANY INFORMATION AS TO THE STATE OF HIS FINANCES
7117-86732-0005 HE HAS I BELIEVE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS IN MORREL'S HANDS AND IF THERE BE ANY GROUNDS FOR APPREHENSION AS THIS IS A GREATER AMOUNT THAN MINE YOU WILL MOST PROBABLY FIND HIM BETTER INFORMED THAN MYSELF
7117-86732-0006 THE ENGLISHMAN SEEMED TO APPRECIATE THIS EXTREME DELICACY MADE HIS BOW AND WENT AWAY PROCEEDING WITH A CHARACTERISTIC BRITISH STRIDE TOWARDS THE STREET MENTIONED
7117-86732-0007 MADE A GESTURE OF SURPRISE WHICH SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME HE HAD BEEN IN HIS PRESENCE
7117-86732-0008 HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF DESPAIR THAT IT WAS EVIDENT ALL THE FACULTIES OF HIS MIND ABSORBED IN THE THOUGHT WHICH OCCUPIED HIM AT THE MOMENT DID NOT ALLOW EITHER HIS MEMORY OR HIS IMAGINATION TO STRAY TO THE PAST THE ENGLISHMAN
7117-86732-0009 WITH THE COOLNESS OF HIS NATION ADDRESSED HIM IN TERMS NEARLY SIMILAR TO THOSE WITH WHICH HE HAD ACCOSTED THE MAYOR OF MARSEILLES
7117-86732-0010 YOUR FEARS ARE UNFORTUNATELY BUT TOO WELL FOUNDED AND YOU SEE BEFORE YOU A MAN IN DESPAIR I HAD TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS PLACED IN THE HANDS OF MORREL AND SON THESE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS WERE THE DOWRY OF MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS TO BE MARRIED IN A FORTNIGHT
7117-86732-0011 AND THESE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS WERE PAYABLE HALF ON THE FIFTEENTH OF THIS MONTH AND THE OTHER HALF ON THE FIFTEENTH OF NEXT MONTH
7117-86732-0012 AND HE HAS BEEN HERE WITHIN THE LAST HALF HOUR TO TELL ME THAT IF HIS SHIP THE PHARAON DID NOT COME INTO PORT ON THE FIFTEENTH HE WOULD BE WHOLLY UNABLE TO MAKE THIS PAYMENT BUT SAID THE ENGLISHMAN THIS LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE A SUSPENSION OF PAYMENT
7117-86732-0013 YOU YES I BUT AT A TREMENDOUS DISCOUNT OF COURSE NO FOR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS OUR HOUSE ADDED THE ENGLISHMAN WITH A LAUGH DOES NOT DO THINGS IN THAT WAY AND YOU WILL PAY READY MONEY
7117-86732-0014 AND THE ENGLISHMAN DREW FROM HIS POCKET A BUNDLE OF BANK NOTES
7117-86732-0015 THAT IS THE AFFAIR OF THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH IN WHOSE NAME I ACT THEY HAVE PERHAPS SOME MOTIVE TO SERVE IN HASTENING THE RUIN OF A RIVAL FIRM BUT ALL I KNOW SIR IS THAT I AM READY TO HAND YOU OVER THIS SUM
7117-86732-0016 IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR ASSIGNMENT OF THE DEBT I ONLY ASK A BROKERAGE
7117-86732-0017 WILL YOU HAVE TWO THREE FIVE PER CENT OR EVEN MORE WHATEVER YOU SAY SIR REPLIED THE ENGLISHMAN LAUGHING I AM LIKE MY HOUSE AND DO NOT DO SUCH THINGS NO THE COMMISSION I ASK IS QUITE DIFFERENT
7117-86732-0018 TO THESE REGISTERS THERE ARE ADDED NOTES RELATIVE TO THE PRISONERS THERE ARE SPECIAL REPORTS ON EVERY PRISONER WELL SIR I WAS EDUCATED AT HOME BY A POOR DEVIL OF AN ABBE WHO DISAPPEARED SUDDENLY
7117-86732-0019 I HAVE SINCE LEARNED THAT HE WAS CONFINED IN THE CHATEAU D'IF AND I SHOULD LIKE TO LEARN SOME PARTICULARS OF HIS DEATH WHAT WAS HIS NAME
7117-86732-0020 HE WAS CRAZY SO THEY SAID OH HE WAS DECIDEDLY VERY POSSIBLY BUT WHAT SORT OF MADNESS WAS IT HE PRETENDED TO KNOW OF AN IMMENSE TREASURE AND OFFERED VAST SUMS TO THE GOVERNMENT IF THEY WOULD LIBERATE HIM POOR DEVIL
7117-86732-0021 ONE OF THOSE WHO HAD CONTRIBUTED THE MOST TO THE RETURN OF THE USURPER IN EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN A VERY RESOLUTE AND VERY DANGEROUS MAN INDEED SAID THE ENGLISHMAN
7117-86732-0022 I MYSELF HAD OCCASION TO SEE THIS MAN IN EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN AND WE COULD ONLY GO INTO HIS DUNGEON WITH A FILE OF SOLDIERS THAT MAN MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION ON ME I SHALL NEVER FORGET HIS COUNTENANCE
7117-86732-0023 THE ENGLISHMAN SMILED IMPERCEPTIBLY AND YOU SAY SIR HE INTERPOSED THAT THE TWO DUNGEONS
7117-86732-0024 THIS TUNNEL WAS DUG NO DOUBT WITH AN INTENTION OF ESCAPE
7117-86732-0025 THAT MUST HAVE CUT SHORT THE PROJECTS OF ESCAPE
7117-86732-0026 BUT NOT FOR THE SURVIVOR ON THE CONTRARY
7117-86732-0027 HE NO DOUBT THOUGHT THAT PRISONERS WHO DIED IN THE CHATEAU D'IF WERE INTERRED IN AN ORDINARY BURIAL GROUND AND HE CONVEYED THE DEAD MAN INTO HIS OWN CELL TOOK HIS PLACE IN THE SACK IN WHICH THEY HAD SEWED UP THE CORPSE AND AWAITED THE MOMENT OF INTERMENT
7117-86732-0028 IT WAS A BOLD STEP AND ONE THAT SHOWED SOME COURAGE REMARKED THE ENGLISHMAN AS I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU SIR HE WAS A VERY DANGEROUS MAN AND FORTUNATELY BY HIS OWN ACT DISEMBARRASSED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE FEARS IT HAD ON HIS ACCOUNT
7117-86732-0029 HOW WAS THAT HOW
7117-86732-0030 WELL THEY FASTENED A THIRTY SIX POUND BALL TO HIS FEET AND THREW HIM INTO THE SEA REALLY EXCLAIMED THE ENGLISHMAN YES SIR CONTINUED THE INSPECTOR OF PRISONS YOU MAY IMAGINE THE AMAZEMENT OF THE FUGITIVE WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF FLUNG HEADLONG OVER THE ROCKS
7117-86732-0031 I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN HIS FACE AT THAT MOMENT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT NO MATTER REPLIED DE BOVILLE IN SUPREME GOOD HUMOR AT THE CERTAINTY OF RECOVERING HIS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS NO MATTER I CAN FANCY IT AND HE SHOUTED WITH LAUGHTER
7117-86732-0032 SO CAN I SAID THE ENGLISHMAN AND HE LAUGHED TOO BUT HE LAUGHED AS THE ENGLISH DO AT THE END OF HIS TEETH AND SO CONTINUED THE ENGLISHMAN WHO FIRST GAINED HIS COMPOSURE HE WAS DROWNED UNQUESTIONABLY
7117-86732-0033 SO THAT THE GOVERNOR GOT RID OF THE DANGEROUS AND THE CRAZY PRISONER AT THE SAME TIME PRECISELY BUT SOME OFFICIAL DOCUMENT WAS DRAWN UP AS TO THIS AFFAIR I SUPPOSE INQUIRED THE ENGLISHMAN YES YES THE MORTUARY DEPOSITION
7117-86732-0034 YOU UNDERSTAND DANTES RELATIONS IF HE HAD ANY MIGHT HAVE SOME INTEREST IN KNOWING IF HE WERE DEAD OR ALIVE SO THAT NOW IF THERE WERE ANYTHING TO INHERIT FROM HIM THEY MAY DO SO WITH EASY CONSCIENCE
7117-86732-0035 BY NO MEANS IT REALLY SEEMS TO ME VERY CURIOUS YES INDEED SO SIR YOU WISH TO SEE ALL RELATING TO THE POOR ABBE WHO REALLY WAS GENTLENESS ITSELF
7117-86732-0036 EACH REGISTER HAD ITS NUMBER EACH FILE OF PAPERS ITS PLACE THE INSPECTOR BEGGED THE ENGLISHMAN TO SEAT HIMSELF IN AN ARM CHAIR AND PLACED BEFORE HIM THE REGISTER AND DOCUMENTS RELATIVE TO THE CHATEAU D'IF GIVING HIM ALL THE TIME HE DESIRED FOR THE EXAMINATION
7117-86732-0037 BUT IT SEEMED THAT THE HISTORY WHICH THE INSPECTOR HAD RELATED INTERESTED HIM GREATLY FOR AFTER HAVING PERUSED THE FIRST DOCUMENTS HE TURNED OVER THE LEAVES UNTIL HE REACHED THE DEPOSITION RESPECTING EDMOND DANTES THERE HE FOUND EVERYTHING ARRANGED IN DUE ORDER
7117-86732-0038 THE ACCUSATION EXAMINATION MORREL'S PETITION
7117-86732-0039 HE FOLDED UP THE ACCUSATION QUIETLY AND PUT IT AS QUIETLY IN HIS POCKET READ THE EXAMINATION AND SAW THAT THE NAME OF NOIRTIER WAS NOT MENTIONED IN IT PERUSED TOO THE APPLICATION DATED TENTH APRIL EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN
7117-86732-0040 IN WHICH MORREL BY THE DEPUTY PROCUREUR'S ADVICE EXAGGERATED WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS FOR NAPOLEON WAS THEN ON THE THRONE THE SERVICES DANTES HAD RENDERED TO THE IMPERIAL CAUSE
7117-86732-0041 THEN HE SAW THROUGH THE WHOLE THING THIS PETITION TO NAPOLEON KEPT BACK BY VILLEFORT HAD BECOME UNDER THE SECOND RESTORATION A TERRIBLE WEAPON AGAINST HIM IN THE HANDS OF THE KING'S ATTORNEY
7117-86732-0042 HE WAS NO LONGER ASTONISHED WHEN HE SEARCHED ON TO FIND IN THE REGISTER THIS NOTE PLACED IN A BRACKET AGAINST HIS NAME
7117-86732-0043 AN INVETERATE BONAPARTIST TOOK AN ACTIVE PART IN THE RETURN FROM THE ISLAND OF ELBA TO BE KEPT IN STRICT SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AND TO BE CLOSELY WATCHED AND GUARDED BENEATH THESE LINES WAS WRITTEN IN ANOTHER HAND SEE NOTE ABOVE NOTHING CAN BE DONE
7117-86732-0044 AS TO THE NOTE WHICH ACCOMPANIED THIS THE ENGLISHMAN UNDERSTOOD THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ADDED BY SOME INSPECTOR WHO HAD TAKEN A MOMENTARY INTEREST IN DANTES SITUATION BUT WHO HAD
7117-86732-0045 FROM THE REMARKS WE HAVE QUOTED FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE ANY EFFECT TO THE INTEREST HE HAD FELT AS WE HAVE SAID
