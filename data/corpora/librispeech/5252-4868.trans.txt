5252-4868-0000 THERE WAS ONCE A WOMAN WHO HAD THREE DAUGHTERS OF WHOM THE ELDEST WAS CALLED LITTLE ONE EYE BECAUSE SHE HAD ONLY ONE EYE IN THE MIDDLE OF HER FOREHEAD AND THE SECOND LITTLE TWO EYES BECAUSE SHE HAD TWO EYES LIKE OTHER PEOPLE AND THE YOUNGEST LITTLE THREE EYES
5252-4868-0001 BUT BECAUSE LITTLE TWO EYES DID NOT LOOK ANY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CHILDREN
5252-4868-0002 AND THEY WERE AS UNKIND TO HER AS EVER THEY COULD BE IT HAPPENED ONE DAY
5252-4868-0003 BUT SHE WAS STILL QUITE HUNGRY BECAUSE HER SISTERS HAD GIVEN HER SO LITTLE TO EAT SO SHE SAT DOWN IN THE MEADOW AND BEGAN TO CRY AND SHE CRIED SO MUCH THAT TWO LITTLE BROOKS RAN OUT OF HER EYES BUT WHEN SHE LOOKED UP ONCE IN HER GRIEF
5252-4868-0004 THERE STOOD A WOMAN BESIDE HER WHO ASKED
5252-4868-0005 AND GIVE ME NOTHING TO EAT EXCEPT WHAT THEY LEAVE TO DAY THEY HAVE GIVEN ME SO LITTLE THAT I AM STILL QUITE HUNGRY THEN THE WISE WOMAN SAID LITTLE TWO EYES
5252-4868-0006 LITTLE GOAT BLEAT LITTLE TABLE APPEAR AND A BEAUTIFULLY SPREAD TABLE WILL STAND BEFORE YOU WITH THE MOST DELICIOUS FOOD ON IT SO THAT YOU CAN EAT AS MUCH AS YOU WANT AND WHEN YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH AND DON'T WANT THE LITTLE TABLE ANY MORE
5252-4868-0007 LITTLE GOAT BLEAT LITTLE TABLE AWAY AND THEN IT WILL VANISH THEN THE WISE WOMAN WENT AWAY BUT LITTLE TWO EYES THOUGHT I MUST TRY AT ONCE IF WHAT SHE HAS TOLD ME IS TRUE FOR I AM MORE HUNGRY THAN EVER AND SHE SAID
5252-4868-0008 LITTLE GOAT BLEAT LITTLE TABLE APPEAR AND SCARCELY HAD SHE UTTERED THE WORDS WHEN THERE STOOD A LITTLE TABLE BEFORE HER COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH ON WHICH WERE ARRANGED A PLATE
5252-4868-0009 WITH A KNIFE AND FORK AND A SILVER SPOON AND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DISHES WHICH WERE SMOKING HOT AS IF THEY HAD JUST COME OUT OF THE KITCHEN THEN LITTLE TWO EYES SAID THE SHORTEST GRACE SHE KNEW
5252-4868-0010 AND WHEN SHE HAD HAD ENOUGH SHE SAID AS THE WISE WOMAN HAD TOLD HER LITTLE GOAT BLEAT LITTLE TABLE AWAY
5252-4868-0011 THAT IS A SPLENDID WAY OF HOUSEKEEPING THOUGHT LITTLE TWO EYES AND SHE WAS QUITE HAPPY AND CONTENTED
5252-4868-0012 SHE FOUND A LITTLE EARTHENWARE DISH WITH THE FOOD THAT HER SISTERS HAD THROWN TO HER BUT SHE DID NOT TOUCH IT THE NEXT DAY SHE WENT OUT AGAIN WITH HER GOAT
5252-4868-0013 THE FIRST AND SECOND TIMES HER SISTERS DID NOT NOTICE THIS BUT WHEN IT HAPPENED CONTINUALLY THEY REMARKED IT AND SAID SOMETHING IS THE MATTER WITH LITTLE TWO EYES FOR SHE ALWAYS LEAVES HER FOOD NOW AND SHE USED TO GOBBLE UP ALL THAT WAS GIVEN HER
5252-4868-0014 SHE MUST HAVE FOUND OTHER MEANS OF GETTING FOOD SO IN ORDER TO GET AT THE TRUTH LITTLE ONE EYE WAS TOLD TO GO OUT WITH LITTLE TWO EYES WHEN SHE DROVE THE GOAT TO PASTURE AND TO NOTICE PARTICULARLY WHAT SHE GOT THERE AND WHETHER ANYONE BROUGHT HER FOOD AND DRINK
5252-4868-0015 NOW WHEN LITTLE TWO EYES WAS SETTING OUT LITTLE ONE EYE CAME UP TO HER AND SAID I WILL GO INTO THE FIELD WITH YOU AND SEE IF YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF THE GOAT AND IF YOU DRIVE HIM PROPERLY TO GET GRASS BUT LITTLE TWO EYES SAW WHAT LITTLE ONE EYE HAD IN HER MIND
5252-4868-0016 COME LITTLE ONE EYE WE WILL SIT DOWN HERE AND I WILL SING YOU SOMETHING LITTLE ONE EYE SAT DOWN
5252-4868-0017 AND BY THE HOT DAY AND AS LITTLE TWO EYES WENT ON SINGING LITTLE ONE EYE ARE YOU AWAKE LITTLE ONE EYE ARE YOU ASLEEP SHE SHUT HER ONE EYE AND FELL ASLEEP WHEN LITTLE TWO EYES SAW THAT LITTLE ONE EYE WAS ASLEEP
5252-4868-0018 AND COULD FIND OUT NOTHING SHE SAID LITTLE GOAT BLEAT LITTLE TABLE APPEAR AND SAT DOWN AT HER TABLE AND ATE AND DRANK AS MUCH AS SHE WANTED THEN SHE SAID AGAIN LITTLE GOAT BLEAT LITTLE TABLE AWAY
5252-4868-0019 AND IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE ALL HAD VANISHED LITTLE TWO EYES THEN WOKE LITTLE ONE EYE AND SAID LITTLE ONE EYE YOU MEANT TO WATCH AND INSTEAD YOU WENT TO SLEEP
5252-4868-0020 COME WE WILL GO HOME SO THEY WENT HOME AND LITTLE TWO EYES AGAIN LEFT HER LITTLE DISH UNTOUCHED AND LITTLE ONE EYE COULD NOT TELL HER MOTHER WHY SHE WOULD NOT EAT AND SAID AS AN EXCUSE I WAS SO SLEEPY OUT OF DOORS THE NEXT DAY
5252-4868-0021 THE MOTHER SAID TO LITTLE THREE EYES THIS TIME YOU SHALL GO WITH LITTLE TWO EYES AND WATCH WHETHER SHE EATS ANYTHING OUT IN THE FIELDS AND WHETHER ANYONE BRINGS HER FOOD AND DRINK FOR EAT AND DRINK SHE MUST SECRETLY SO LITTLE THREE EYES
5252-4868-0022 AND IF YOU DRIVE HIM PROPERLY TO GET GRASS BUT LITTLE TWO EYES KNEW WHAT LITTLE THREE EYES HAD IN HER MIND

5252-4868-0024 DID NOT FALL ASLEEP OF COURSE LITTLE THREE EYES SHUT THAT EYE ALSO OUT OF CUNNING TO LOOK AS IF SHE WERE ASLEEP BUT IT WAS BLINKING AND COULD SEE EVERYTHING QUITE WELL AND WHEN LITTLE TWO EYES THOUGHT THAT LITTLE THREE EYES WAS SOUND ASLEEP SHE SAID HER RHYME
5252-4868-0025 LITTLE GOAT BLEAT LITTLE TABLE APPEAR AND ATE AND DRANK TO HER HEART'S CONTENT AND THEN MADE THE TABLE GO AWAY AGAIN BY SAYING LITTLE GOAT BLEAT LITTLE TABLE AWAY BUT LITTLE THREE EYES HAD SEEN EVERYTHING
5252-4868-0026 THEN LITTLE TWO EYES CAME TO HER AND WOKE HER AND SAID WELL LITTLE THREE EYES HAVE YOU BEEN ASLEEP YOU WATCH WELL COME WE WILL GO HOME WHEN THEY REACHED HOME LITTLE TWO EYES DID NOT EAT AGAIN AND LITTLE THREE EYES SAID TO THE MOTHER
5252-4868-0027 I KNOW NOW WHY THAT PROUD THING EATS NOTHING WHEN SHE SAYS TO THE GOAT IN THE FIELD LITTLE GOAT BLEAT LITTLE TABLE APPEAR
5252-4868-0028 AND WHEN SHE HAS HAD ENOUGH SHE SAYS LITTLE GOAT BLEAT LITTLE TABLE AWAY AND EVERYTHING DISAPPEARS AGAIN I SAW IT ALL EXACTLY SHE MADE TWO OF MY EYES GO TO SLEEP WITH A LITTLE RHYME
5252-4868-0029 BUT THE ONE IN MY FOREHEAD REMAINED AWAKE LUCKILY THEN THE ENVIOUS MOTHER CRIED OUT WILL YOU FARE BETTER THAN WE DO YOU SHALL NOT HAVE THE CHANCE TO DO SO AGAIN AND SHE FETCHED A KNIFE AND KILLED THE GOAT WHEN LITTLE TWO EYES SAW THIS
5252-4868-0030 SHE WENT OUT FULL OF GRIEF AND SAT DOWN IN THE MEADOW AND WEPT BITTER TEARS THEN AGAIN THE WISE WOMAN STOOD BEFORE HER AND SAID LITTLE TWO EYES WHAT ARE YOU CRYING FOR HAVE I NOT REASON TO CRY SHE ANSWERED
5252-4868-0031 THE GOAT WHICH WHEN I SAID THE LITTLE RHYME SPREAD THE TABLE SO BEAUTIFULLY MY MOTHER HAS KILLED AND NOW I MUST SUFFER HUNGER AND WANT AGAIN THE WISE WOMAN SAID LITTLE TWO EYES I WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD PIECE OF ADVICE
5252-4868-0032 ASK YOUR SISTERS TO GIVE YOU THE HEART OF THE DEAD GOAT AND BURY IT IN THE EARTH BEFORE THE HOUSE DOOR THAT WILL BRING YOU GOOD LUCK THEN SHE DISAPPEARED AND LITTLE TWO EYES WENT HOME AND SAID TO HER SISTERS DEAR SISTERS DO GIVE ME SOMETHING OF MY GOAT
5252-4868-0033 I ASK NOTHING BETTER THAN ITS HEART THEN THEY LAUGHED AND SAID YOU CAN HAVE THAT IF YOU WANT NOTHING MORE AND LITTLE TWO EYES TOOK THE HEART AND BURIED IT IN THE EVENING WHEN ALL WAS QUIET AS THE WISE WOMAN HAD TOLD HER BEFORE THE HOUSE DOOR
5252-4868-0034 THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THEY ALL AWOKE AND CAME TO THE HOUSE DOOR THERE STOOD A MOST WONDERFUL TREE
5252-4868-0035 THEN THE MOTHER SAID TO LITTLE ONE EYE CLIMB UP MY CHILD AND BREAK US OFF THE FRUIT FROM THE TREE LITTLE ONE EYE CLIMBED UP BUT JUST WHEN SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE HOLD OF ONE OF THE GOLDEN APPLES THE BOUGH SPRANG OUT OF HER HANDS AND THIS HAPPENED EVERY TIME
5252-4868-0036 SO THAT SHE COULD NOT BREAK OFF A SINGLE APPLE HOWEVER HARD SHE TRIED THEN THE MOTHER SAID LITTLE THREE EYES DO YOU CLIMB UP YOU WITH YOUR THREE EYES CAN SEE ROUND BETTER THAN LITTLE ONE EYE SO LITTLE ONE EYE SLID DOWN AND LITTLE THREE EYES CLIMBED UP
5252-4868-0037 BUT SHE WAS NOT ANY MORE SUCCESSFUL LOOK ROUND AS SHE MIGHT THE GOLDEN APPLES BENT THEMSELVES BACK AT LAST THE MOTHER GOT IMPATIENT AND CLIMBED UP HERSELF
5252-4868-0038 BUT SHE WAS EVEN LESS SUCCESSFUL THAN LITTLE ONE EYE AND LITTLE THREE EYES IN CATCHING HOLD OF THE FRUIT AND ONLY GRASPED AT THE EMPTY AIR THEN LITTLE TWO EYES SAID
5252-4868-0039 PERHAPS I SHALL SUCCEED BETTER THE SISTERS CALLED OUT YOU WITH YOUR TWO EYES WILL NO DOUBT SUCCEED BUT LITTLE TWO EYES CLIMBED UP AND THE GOLDEN APPLES DID NOT JUMP AWAY FROM HER BUT BEHAVED QUITE PROPERLY SO THAT SHE COULD PLUCK THEM OFF ONE AFTER THE OTHER
5252-4868-0040 AND BROUGHT A WHOLE APRON FULL DOWN WITH HER THE MOTHER TOOK THEM FROM HER AND INSTEAD OF BEHAVING BETTER TO POOR LITTLE TWO EYES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
5252-4868-0041 IT HAPPENED ONE DAY THAT WHEN THEY WERE ALL STANDING TOGETHER BY THE TREE THAT A YOUNG KNIGHT CAME RIDING ALONG BE QUICK LITTLE TWO EYES CRIED THE TWO SISTERS CREEP UNDER THIS SO THAT YOU SHALL NOT DISGRACE US
5252-4868-0042 AND THEY PUT OVER POOR LITTLE TWO EYES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AN EMPTY CASK WHICH WAS STANDING CLOSE TO THE TREE
5252-4868-0043 WHEN THE KNIGHT WHO WAS A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN RODE UP HE WONDERED TO SEE THE MARVELLOUS TREE OF GOLD AND SILVER AND SAID TO THE TWO SISTERS WHOSE IS THIS BEAUTIFUL TREE WHOEVER WILL GIVE ME A TWIG OF IT SHALL HAVE WHATEVER SHE WANTS
5252-4868-0044 THEN LITTLE ONE EYE AND LITTLE THREE EYES ANSWERED THAT THE TREE BELONGED TO THEM AND THAT THEY WOULD CERTAINLY BREAK HIM OFF A TWIG THEY GAVE THEMSELVES A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE BUT IN VAIN THE TWIGS AND FRUIT BENT BACK EVERY TIME FROM THEIR HANDS
5252-4868-0045 THEN THE KNIGHT SAID IT IS VERY STRANGE THAT THE TREE SHOULD BELONG TO YOU
5252-4868-0046 AND WHILE THEY WERE SAYING THIS LITTLE TWO EYES ROLLED A COUPLE OF GOLDEN APPLES FROM UNDER THE CASK SO THAT THEY LAY AT THE KNIGHT'S FEET FOR SHE WAS ANGRY WITH LITTLE ONE EYE AND LITTLE THREE EYES FOR NOT SPEAKING THE TRUTH WHEN THE KNIGHT SAW THE APPLES HE WAS ASTONISHED
5252-4868-0047 AND ASKED WHERE THEY CAME FROM LITTLE ONE EYE AND LITTLE THREE EYES ANSWERED THAT THEY HAD ANOTHER SISTER BUT SHE COULD NOT BE SEEN BECAUSE SHE HAD ONLY TWO EYES LIKE ORDINARY PEOPLE BUT THE KNIGHT DEMANDED TO SEE HER AND CALLED OUT LITTLE TWO EYES COME FORTH
5252-4868-0048 THEN LITTLE TWO EYES CAME OUT FROM UNDER THE CASK QUITE HAPPILY AND THE KNIGHT WAS ASTONISHED AT HER GREAT BEAUTY AND SAID
5252-4868-0049 YES ANSWERED LITTLE TWO EYES I CAN FOR THE TREE IS MINE SO SHE CLIMBED UP AND BROKE OFF A SMALL BRANCH WITH ITS SILVER LEAVES AND GOLDEN FRUIT WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE AND GAVE IT TO THE KNIGHT THEN HE SAID
5252-4868-0050 I SHOULD BE HAPPY THEN THE KNIGHT LIFTED LITTLE TWO EYES ON HIS HORSE AND TOOK HER HOME TO HIS FATHER'S CASTLE THERE HE GAVE HER BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES AND FOOD AND DRINK AND BECAUSE HE LOVED HER SO MUCH HE MARRIED HER AND THE WEDDING WAS CELEBRATED WITH GREAT JOY
5252-4868-0051 WHEN THE HANDSOME KNIGHT CARRIED LITTLE TWO EYES AWAY WITH HIM THE TWO SISTERS ENVIED HER GOOD LUCK AT FIRST BUT THE WONDERFUL TREE IS STILL WITH US AFTER ALL THEY THOUGHT AND ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT BREAK ANY FRUIT FROM IT EVERYONE WILL STOP AND LOOK AT IT
5252-4868-0052 LITTLE TWO EYES LIVED HAPPILY FOR A LONG TIME ONCE TWO POOR WOMEN CAME TO THE CASTLE TO BEG ALMS
