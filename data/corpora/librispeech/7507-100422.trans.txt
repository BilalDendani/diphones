7507-100422-0000 IT MAY RAIN IN ACACIA ROAD BUT NEVER WHEN I AM THERE THE SUN SHINES ON LABURNUM LODGE WITH ITS PINK MAY TREE ON THE CEDARS WITH ITS TWO CLEAN LIMES
7507-100422-0001 IS THE TRUE HOME AFTER ALL WHEN I PASS LABURNUM LODGE I THINK OF HIM SAYING GOOD BYE TO HER AT THE GATE AS HE TAKES THE AIR EACH MORNING ON HIS WAY TO THE STATION WHAT IF THE TRAIN IS CROWDED
7507-100422-0002 AND THEN HOW INTERESTING WILL BE EVERYTHING WHICH HAPPENS TO HIM THERE SINCE HE HAS HER TO TELL IT TO WHEN HE COMES HOME THE MOST ORDINARY STREET ACCIDENT BECOMES EXCITING IF A STORY HAS TO BE MADE OF IT
7507-100422-0003 HAPPY THE MAN WHO CAN SAY OF EACH LITTLE INCIDENT I MUST REMEMBER TO TELL HER WHEN I GET HOME AND IT IS ONLY IN THE SUBURBS THAT ONE GETS HOME ONE DOES NOT
7507-100422-0004 GET HOME TO GROSVENOR SQUARE ONE IS SIMPLY IN OR OUT BUT THE MASTER OF LABURNUM LODGE MAY HAVE SOMETHING BETTER TO TELL HIS WIFE THAN THE INCIDENT OF THE RUNAWAY HORSE
7507-100422-0005 HE MAY HAVE HEARD A NEW FUNNY STORY AT LUNCH THE JOKE MAY HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THE CITY BUT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT HIS WIFE IN THE SUBURBS WILL HAVE HEARD IT PUT IT ON THE CREDIT SIDE OF MARRIAGE THAT YOU CAN TREASURE UP YOUR JOKES FOR SOME ONE ELSE
7507-100422-0006 SO IT WILL BE A HAPPY MEETING UNDER THE PINK MAY TREE OF LABURNUM LODGE WHEN THESE TWO ARE RESTORED SAFELY TO EACH OTHER AFTER THE EXCITEMENTS OF THE DAY POSSIBLY
7507-100422-0007 THEY WILL EVEN DO A LITTLE GARDENING TOGETHER IN THE STILL GLOWING EVENING IF LIFE HAS ANYTHING MORE TO OFFER THAN THIS IT WILL BE FOUND AT HOLLY HOUSE WHERE THERE ARE BABIES
7507-100422-0008 BABIES GIVE AN ADDED EXCITEMENT TO THE MASTER'S HOMECOMING FOR ALMOST ANYTHING MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO THEM WHILE HE HAS BEEN AWAY
7507-100422-0009 IN THE MORNING TOO ANNE WILL WALK WITH HIM TO THE END OF THE ROAD
7507-100422-0010 SAYING GOOD BYE TO ANNE AT THE END OF THE ROAD AND KNOWING THAT SHE WILL BE ALIVE WHEN HE COMES BACK IN THE EVENING THAT OUGHT TO MAKE THE DAY'S WORK GO QUICKLY BUT IT IS THE CEDARS WHICH GIVES US THE SECRET OF THE HAPPINESS OF THE SUBURBS
7507-100422-0011 THE DELIGHTFUL BUSINESS OF LOVE MAKING IS IN FULL SWING MARRIAGES ARE NOT ARRANGED IN THE SUBURBS THEY GROW NATURALLY OUT OF THE PLEASANT INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THE CEDARS
7507-100422-0012 THE ELMS AND ROSE BANK I SEE TOM WALKING OVER TO THE ELMS RACKET IN HAND TO PLAY TENNIS WITH MISS MURIEL HE IS HOPING FOR AN INVITATION TO REMAIN TO SUPPER
7507-100422-0013 ANYHOW HE IS GOING TO ASK MISS MURIEL TO COME ACROSS TO LUNCH TO MORROW
7507-100422-0014 BUT IT WILL BE TOM WHO WILL DO MOST OF THE TALKING I AM SURE THAT THE MARRIAGES MADE IN ACACIA ROAD ARE HAPPY THAT IS WHY I HAVE NO FEARS FOR HOLLY HOUSE AND LABURNUM LODGE OF COURSE THEY DIDN'T MAKE LOVE IN THIS ACACIA ROAD
7507-100422-0015 THEY ARE COME FROM THE ACACIA ROAD OF SOME OTHER SUBURB WISELY DECIDING THAT THEY WILL BE BETTER AWAY FROM THEIR PEOPLE BUT THEY MET EACH OTHER IN THE SAME WAY AS TOM AND MURIEL ARE MEETING
7507-100422-0016 AT THE TENNIS CLUB SURROUNDED BY THE YOUNG BOUNDERS CONFOUND THEM OF TURRET COURT AND THE WILDERNESS SHE HAS HEARD OF HIM FALLING OFF HIS BICYCLE OR QUARRELLING WITH HIS FATHER BLESS YOU THEY KNOW ALL ABOUT EACH OTHER
