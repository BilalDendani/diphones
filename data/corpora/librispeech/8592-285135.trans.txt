8592-285135-0000 MEN DIE NIGHTLY IN THEIR BEDS WRINGING THE HANDS OF GHOSTLY CONFESSORS AND LOOKING THEM PITEOUSLY IN THE EYES
8592-285135-0001 NOW AND THEN ALAS THE CONSCIENCE OF MAN TAKES UP A BURTHEN SO HEAVY IN HORROR THAT IT CAN BE THROWN DOWN ONLY INTO THE GRAVE AND THUS THE ESSENCE OF ALL CRIME IS UNDIVULGED
8592-285135-0002 NOT LONG AGO ABOUT THE CLOSING IN OF AN EVENING IN AUTUMN I SAT AT THE LARGE BOW WINDOW OF THE D COFFEE HOUSE IN LONDON FOR SOME MONTHS I HAD BEEN ILL IN HEALTH BUT WAS NOW CONVALESCENT AND WITH RETURNING STRENGTH
8592-285135-0003 MOODS OF THE KEENEST APPETENCY WHEN THE FILM FROM THE MENTAL VISION DEPARTS
8592-285135-0004 THE MAD AND FLIMSY RHETORIC OF GORGIAS MERELY TO BREATHE WAS ENJOYMENT AND I DERIVED POSITIVE PLEASURE EVEN FROM MANY OF THE LEGITIMATE SOURCES OF PAIN I FELT A CALM BUT INQUISITIVE INTEREST IN EVERY THING
8592-285135-0005 WITH A CIGAR IN MY MOUTH AND A NEWSPAPER IN MY LAP I HAD BEEN AMUSING MYSELF FOR THE GREATER PART OF THE AFTERNOON NOW IN PORING OVER ADVERTISEMENTS NOW IN OBSERVING THE PROMISCUOUS COMPANY IN THE ROOM AND NOW IN PEERING THROUGH THE SMOKY PANES INTO THE STREET
8592-285135-0006 THIS LATTER IS ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL THOROUGHFARES OF THE CITY AND HAD BEEN VERY MUCH CROWDED DURING THE WHOLE DAY BUT AS THE DARKNESS CAME ON THE THRONG MOMENTLY INCREASED AND BY THE TIME THE LAMPS WERE WELL LIGHTED
8592-285135-0007 TWO DENSE AND CONTINUOUS TIDES OF POPULATION WERE RUSHING PAST THE DOOR AT THIS PARTICULAR PERIOD OF THE EVENING I HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN IN A SIMILAR SITUATION AND THE TUMULTUOUS SEA OF HUMAN HEADS FILLED ME THEREFORE WITH A DELICIOUS NOVELTY OF EMOTION
8592-285135-0008 I GAVE UP AT LENGTH ALL CARE OF THINGS WITHIN THE HOTEL AND BECAME ABSORBED IN CONTEMPLATION OF THE SCENE WITHOUT AT FIRST MY OBSERVATIONS TOOK AN ABSTRACT AND GENERALIZING TURN
8592-285135-0009 I LOOKED AT THE PASSENGERS IN MASSES AND THOUGHT OF THEM IN THEIR AGGREGATE RELATIONS SOON HOWEVER I DESCENDED TO DETAILS AND REGARDED WITH MINUTE INTEREST THE INNUMERABLE VARIETIES OF FIGURE
8592-285135-0010 BY FAR THE GREATER NUMBER OF THOSE WHO WENT BY HAD A SATISFIED BUSINESS LIKE DEMEANOR AND SEEMED TO BE THINKING ONLY OF MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE PRESS THEIR BROWS WERE KNIT AND THEIR EYES ROLLED QUICKLY
8592-285135-0011 WHEN PUSHED AGAINST BY FELLOW WAYFARERS THEY EVINCED NO SYMPTOM OF IMPATIENCE BUT ADJUSTED THEIR CLOTHES AND HURRIED ON
8592-285135-0012 OTHERS STILL A NUMEROUS CLASS WERE RESTLESS IN THEIR MOVEMENTS HAD FLUSHED FACES AND TALKED AND GESTICULATED TO THEMSELVES AS IF FEELING IN SOLITUDE ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY DENSENESS OF THE COMPANY AROUND
8592-285135-0013 WHEN IMPEDED IN THEIR PROGRESS THESE PEOPLE SUDDENLY CEASED MUTTERING BUT RE DOUBLED THEIR GESTICULATIONS AND AWAITED WITH AN ABSENT AND OVERDONE SMILE UPON THE LIPS THE COURSE OF THE PERSONS IMPEDING THEM
8592-285135-0014 IF JOSTLED THEY BOWED PROFUSELY TO THE JOSTLERS AND APPEARED OVERWHELMED WITH CONFUSION THERE WAS NOTHING VERY DISTINCTIVE ABOUT THESE TWO LARGE CLASSES BEYOND WHAT I HAVE NOTED THEIR HABILIMENTS BELONGED TO THAT ORDER WHICH IS POINTEDLY TERMED THE DECENT
8592-285135-0015 THEY WERE UNDOUBTEDLY NOBLEMEN MERCHANTS ATTORNEYS TRADESMEN STOCK JOBBERS THE EUPATRIDS AND THE COMMON PLACES OF SOCIETY MEN OF LEISURE AND MEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN AFFAIRS OF THEIR OWN CONDUCTING BUSINESS UPON THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITY
8592-285135-0016 THEY DID NOT GREATLY EXCITE MY ATTENTION THE TRIBE OF CLERKS WAS AN OBVIOUS ONE AND HERE I DISCERNED TWO REMARKABLE DIVISIONS THERE WERE THE JUNIOR CLERKS OF FLASH HOUSES YOUNG GENTLEMEN WITH TIGHT COATS BRIGHT BOOTS WELL OILED HAIR AND SUPERCILIOUS LIPS
8592-285135-0017 THE MANNER OF THESE PERSONS SEEMED TO ME AN EXACT FAC SIMILE OF WHAT HAD BEEN THE PERFECTION OF BON TON ABOUT TWELVE OR EIGHTEEN MONTHS BEFORE THEY WORE THE CAST OFF GRACES OF THE GENTRY AND THIS I BELIEVE INVOLVES THE BEST DEFINITION OF THE CLASS
8592-285135-0018 THE DIVISION OF THE UPPER CLERKS OF STAUNCH FIRMS OR OF THE STEADY OLD FELLOWS IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO MISTAKE
8592-285135-0019 THESE WERE KNOWN BY THEIR COATS AND PANTALOONS OF BLACK OR BROWN MADE TO SIT COMFORTABLY WITH WHITE CRAVATS AND WAISTCOATS BROAD SOLID LOOKING SHOES AND THICK HOSE OR GAITERS THEY HAD ALL SLIGHTLY BALD HEADS FROM WHICH THE RIGHT EARS LONG USED TO PEN HOLDING
8592-285135-0020 HAD AN ODD HABIT OF STANDING OFF ON END I OBSERVED THAT THEY ALWAYS REMOVED OR SETTLED THEIR HATS WITH BOTH HANDS AND WORE WATCHES WITH SHORT GOLD CHAINS OF A SUBSTANTIAL AND ANCIENT PATTERN THEIRS WAS THE AFFECTATION OF RESPECTABILITY
8592-285135-0021 IF INDEED THERE BE AN AFFECTATION SO HONORABLE THERE WERE MANY INDIVIDUALS OF DASHING APPEARANCE WHOM I EASILY UNDERSTOOD AS BELONGING TO THE RACE OF SWELL PICK POCKETS WITH WHICH ALL GREAT CITIES ARE INFESTED
8592-285135-0022 I WATCHED THESE GENTRY WITH MUCH INQUISITIVENESS AND FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE HOW THEY SHOULD EVER BE MISTAKEN FOR GENTLEMEN BY GENTLEMEN THEMSELVES THEIR VOLUMINOUSNESS OF WRISTBAND WITH AN AIR OF EXCESSIVE FRANKNESS SHOULD BETRAY THEM AT ONCE
8592-285135-0023 THE GAMBLERS OF WHOM I DESCRIED NOT A FEW WERE STILL MORE EASILY RECOGNISABLE THEY WORE EVERY VARIETY OF DRESS FROM THAT OF THE DESPERATE THIMBLE RIG BULLY
8592-285135-0024 WITH VELVET WAISTCOAT FANCY NECKERCHIEF GILT CHAINS AND FILAGREED BUTTONS TO THAT OF THE SCRUPULOUSLY INORNATE CLERGYMAN THAN WHICH NOTHING COULD BE LESS LIABLE TO SUSPICION
8592-285135-0025 STILL ALL WERE DISTINGUISHED BY A CERTAIN SODDEN SWARTHINESS OF COMPLEXION A FILMY DIMNESS OF EYE AND PALLOR AND COMPRESSION OF LIP THERE WERE TWO OTHER TRAITS MOREOVER BY WHICH I COULD ALWAYS DETECT THEM
8592-285135-0026 A GUARDED LOWNESS OF TONE IN CONVERSATION AND A MORE THAN ORDINARY EXTENSION OF THE THUMB IN A DIRECTION AT RIGHT ANGLES WITH THE FINGERS VERY OFTEN IN COMPANY WITH THESE SHARPERS I OBSERVED AN ORDER OF MEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT IN HABITS BUT STILL BIRDS OF A KINDRED FEATHER
8592-285135-0027 THEY MAY BE DEFINED AS THE GENTLEMEN WHO LIVE BY THEIR WITS THEY SEEM TO PREY UPON THE PUBLIC IN TWO BATTALIONS THAT OF THE DANDIES AND THAT OF THE MILITARY MEN OF THE FIRST GRADE THE LEADING FEATURES ARE LONG LOCKS AND SMILES
8592-285135-0028 OF THE SECOND FROGGED COATS AND FROWNS DESCENDING IN THE SCALE OF WHAT IS TERMED GENTILITY I FOUND DARKER AND DEEPER THEMES FOR SPECULATION
8592-285135-0029 I SAW JEW PEDLARS WITH HAWK EYES FLASHING FROM COUNTENANCES WHOSE EVERY OTHER FEATURE WORE ONLY AN EXPRESSION OF ABJECT HUMILITY STURDY PROFESSIONAL STREET BEGGARS SCOWLING UPON MENDICANTS OF A BETTER STAMP WHOM DESPAIR ALONE HAD DRIVEN FORTH INTO THE NIGHT FOR CHARITY
8592-285135-0030 FEEBLE AND GHASTLY INVALIDS UPON WHOM DEATH HAD PLACED A SURE HAND AND WHO SIDLED AND TOTTERED THROUGH THE MOB LOOKING EVERY ONE BESEECHINGLY IN THE FACE AS IF IN SEARCH OF SOME CHANCE CONSOLATION SOME LOST HOPE
8592-285135-0031 MODEST YOUNG GIRLS RETURNING FROM LONG AND LATE LABOR TO A CHEERLESS HOME AND SHRINKING MORE TEARFULLY THAN INDIGNANTLY FROM THE GLANCES OF RUFFIANS WHOSE DIRECT CONTACT EVEN COULD NOT BE AVOIDED
8592-285135-0032 WOMEN OF THE TOWN OF ALL KINDS AND OF ALL AGES THE UNEQUIVOCAL BEAUTY IN THE PRIME OF HER WOMANHOOD PUTTING ONE IN MIND OF THE STATUE IN LUCIAN WITH THE SURFACE OF PARIAN MARBLE AND THE INTERIOR FILLED WITH FILTH
8592-285135-0033 THE MERE CHILD OF IMMATURE FORM YET FROM LONG ASSOCIATION AN ADEPT IN THE DREADFUL COQUETRIES OF HER TRADE AND BURNING WITH A RABID AMBITION TO BE RANKED THE EQUAL OF HER ELDERS IN VICE
8592-285135-0034 DRUNKARDS INNUMERABLE AND INDESCRIBABLE SOME IN SHREDS AND PATCHES REELING INARTICULATE WITH BRUISED VISAGE AND LACK LUSTRE EYES
8592-285135-0035 SOME IN WHOLE ALTHOUGH FILTHY GARMENTS WITH A SLIGHTLY UNSTEADY SWAGGER THICK SENSUAL LIPS AND HEARTY LOOKING RUBICUND FACES OTHERS CLOTHED IN MATERIALS WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN GOOD AND WHICH EVEN NOW WERE SCRUPULOUSLY WELL BRUSHED
8592-285135-0036 MEN WHO WALKED WITH A MORE THAN NATURALLY FIRM AND SPRINGY STEP BUT WHOSE COUNTENANCES WERE FEARFULLY PALE WHOSE EYES HIDEOUSLY WILD AND RED AND WHO CLUTCHED WITH QUIVERING FINGERS AS THEY STRODE THROUGH THE CROWD AT EVERY OBJECT WHICH CAME WITHIN THEIR REACH
8592-285135-0037 BESIDE THESE PIE MEN PORTERS COAL HEAVERS SWEEPS ORGAN GRINDERS MONKEY EXHIBITERS AND BALLAD MONGERS THOSE WHO VENDED WITH THOSE WHO SANG RAGGED ARTIZANS AND EXHAUSTED LABORERS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION
8592-285135-0038 AND GAVE AN ACHING SENSATION TO THE EYE AS THE NIGHT DEEPENED SO DEEPENED TO ME THE INTEREST OF THE SCENE FOR NOT ONLY DID THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE CROWD MATERIALLY ALTER
8592-285135-0039 ITS GENTLER FEATURES RETIRING IN THE GRADUAL WITHDRAWAL OF THE MORE ORDERLY PORTION OF THE PEOPLE AND ITS HARSHER ONES COMING OUT INTO BOLDER RELIEF AS THE LATE HOUR BROUGHT FORTH EVERY SPECIES OF INFAMY FROM ITS DEN BUT THE RAYS OF THE GAS LAMPS FEEBLE AT FIRST IN THEIR STRUGGLE WITH THE DYING DAY
8592-285135-0040 HAD NOW AT LENGTH GAINED ASCENDANCY AND THREW OVER EVERY THING A FITFUL AND GARISH LUSTRE ALL WAS DARK YET SPLENDID AS THAT EBONY TO WHICH HAS BEEN LIKENED THE STYLE OF TERTULLIAN
8592-285135-0041 THE WILD EFFECTS OF THE LIGHT ENCHAINED ME TO AN EXAMINATION OF INDIVIDUAL FACES AND ALTHOUGH THE RAPIDITY WITH WHICH THE WORLD OF LIGHT FLITTED BEFORE THE WINDOW PREVENTED ME FROM CASTING MORE THAN A GLANCE UPON EACH VISAGE
8592-285135-0042 STILL IT SEEMED THAT IN MY THEN PECULIAR MENTAL STATE I COULD FREQUENTLY READ EVEN IN THAT BRIEF INTERVAL OF A GLANCE THE HISTORY OF LONG YEARS
8592-285135-0043 WITH MY BROW TO THE GLASS I WAS THUS OCCUPIED IN SCRUTINIZING THE MOB WHEN SUDDENLY THERE CAME INTO VIEW A COUNTENANCE THAT OF A DECREPID OLD MAN SOME SIXTY FIVE OR SEVENTY YEARS OF AGE
8592-285135-0044 A COUNTENANCE WHICH AT ONCE ARRESTED AND ABSORBED MY WHOLE ATTENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE ABSOLUTE IDIOSYNCRASY OF ITS EXPRESSION ANY THING EVEN REMOTELY RESEMBLING THAT EXPRESSION I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE I WELL REMEMBER THAT MY FIRST THOUGHT UPON BEHOLDING IT
8592-285135-0045 WAS THAT RETZCH HAD HE VIEWED IT WOULD HAVE GREATLY PREFERRED IT TO HIS OWN PICTURAL INCARNATIONS OF THE FIEND AS I ENDEAVORED DURING THE BRIEF MINUTE OF MY ORIGINAL SURVEY TO FORM SOME ANALYSIS OF THE MEANING CONVEYED
8592-285135-0046 THERE AROSE CONFUSEDLY AND PARADOXICALLY WITHIN MY MIND THE IDEAS OF VAST MENTAL POWER OF CAUTION OF PENURIOUSNESS OF AVARICE OF COOLNESS OF MALICE OF BLOOD THIRSTINESS OF TRIUMPH OF MERRIMENT OF EXCESSIVE TERROR
8592-285135-0047 OF INTENSE OF SUPREME DESPAIR I FELT SINGULARLY AROUSED STARTLED FASCINATED HOW WILD A HISTORY I SAID TO MYSELF IS WRITTEN WITHIN THAT BOSOM
8592-285135-0048 THEN CAME A CRAVING DESIRE TO KEEP THE MAN IN VIEW TO KNOW MORE OF HIM HURRIEDLY PUTTING ON AN OVERCOAT AND SEIZING MY HAT AND CANE I MADE MY WAY INTO THE STREET AND PUSHED THROUGH THE CROWD IN THE DIRECTION WHICH I HAD SEEN HIM TAKE FOR HE HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED
8592-285135-0049 WITH SOME LITTLE DIFFICULTY I AT LENGTH CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF HIM APPROACHED AND FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY YET CAUTIOUSLY SO AS NOT TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION I HAD NOW A GOOD OPPORTUNITY OF EXAMINING HIS PERSON
8592-285135-0050 HE WAS SHORT IN STATURE VERY THIN AND APPARENTLY VERY FEEBLE HIS CLOTHES GENERALLY WERE FILTHY AND RAGGED BUT AS HE CAME NOW AND THEN WITHIN THE STRONG GLARE OF A LAMP I PERCEIVED THAT HIS LINEN ALTHOUGH DIRTY WAS OF BEAUTIFUL TEXTURE
8592-285135-0051 AND MY VISION DECEIVED ME OR THROUGH A RENT IN A CLOSELY BUTTONED AND EVIDENTLY SECOND HANDED ROQUELAIRE WHICH ENVELOPED HIM I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE BOTH OF A DIAMOND AND OF A DAGGER
8592-285135-0052 THESE OBSERVATIONS HEIGHTENED MY CURIOSITY AND I RESOLVED TO FOLLOW THE STRANGER WHITHERSOEVER HE SHOULD GO IT WAS NOW FULLY NIGHT FALL AND A THICK HUMID FOG HUNG OVER THE CITY SOON ENDING IN A SETTLED AND HEAVY RAIN
8592-285135-0053 THIS CHANGE OF WEATHER HAD AN ODD EFFECT UPON THE CROWD THE WHOLE OF WHICH WAS AT ONCE PUT INTO NEW COMMOTION AND OVERSHADOWED BY A WORLD OF UMBRELLAS THE WAVER THE JOSTLE AND THE HUM INCREASED IN A TENFOLD DEGREE
8592-285135-0054 FOR MY OWN PART I DID NOT MUCH REGARD THE RAIN THE LURKING OF AN OLD FEVER IN MY SYSTEM RENDERING THE MOISTURE SOMEWHAT TOO DANGEROUSLY PLEASANT
8592-285135-0055 FOR HALF AN HOUR THE OLD MAN HELD HIS WAY WITH DIFFICULTY ALONG THE GREAT THOROUGHFARE AND I HERE WALKED CLOSE AT HIS ELBOW THROUGH FEAR OF LOSING SIGHT OF HIM NEVER ONCE TURNING HIS HEAD TO LOOK BACK HE DID NOT OBSERVE ME
8592-285135-0056 BY AND BYE HE PASSED INTO A CROSS STREET WHICH ALTHOUGH DENSELY FILLED WITH PEOPLE WAS NOT QUITE SO MUCH THRONGED AS THE MAIN ONE HE HAD QUITTED HERE A CHANGE IN HIS DEMEANOR BECAME EVIDENT HE WALKED MORE SLOWLY AND WITH LESS OBJECT THAN BEFORE MORE HESITATINGLY
8592-285135-0057 HE CROSSED AND RE CROSSED THE WAY REPEATEDLY WITHOUT APPARENT AIM AND THE PRESS WAS STILL SO THICK THAT AT EVERY SUCH MOVEMENT I WAS OBLIGED TO FOLLOW HIM CLOSELY THE STREET WAS A NARROW AND LONG ONE AND HIS COURSE LAY WITHIN IT FOR NEARLY AN HOUR
8592-285135-0058 DURING WHICH THE PASSENGERS HAD GRADUALLY DIMINISHED TO ABOUT THAT NUMBER WHICH IS ORDINARILY SEEN AT NOON IN BROADWAY NEAR THE PARK SO VAST A DIFFERENCE IS THERE BETWEEN A LONDON POPULACE AND THAT OF THE MOST FREQUENTED AMERICAN CITY
8592-285135-0059 A SECOND TURN BROUGHT US INTO A SQUARE BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED AND OVERFLOWING WITH LIFE THE OLD MANNER OF THE STRANGER RE APPEARED HIS CHIN FELL UPON HIS BREAST
8592-285135-0060 WHILE HIS EYES ROLLED WILDLY FROM UNDER HIS KNIT BROWS IN EVERY DIRECTION UPON THOSE WHO HEMMED HIM IN HE URGED HIS WAY STEADILY AND PERSEVERINGLY I WAS SURPRISED HOWEVER TO FIND UPON HIS HAVING MADE THE CIRCUIT OF THE SQUARE THAT HE TURNED AND RETRACED HIS STEPS
8592-285135-0061 STILL MORE WAS I ASTONISHED TO SEE HIM REPEAT THE SAME WALK SEVERAL TIMES ONCE NEARLY DETECTING ME AS HE CAME ROUND WITH A SUDDEN MOVEMENT IN THIS EXERCISE HE SPENT ANOTHER HOUR AT THE END OF WHICH WE MET WITH FAR LESS INTERRUPTION FROM PASSENGERS THAN AT FIRST
8592-285135-0062 THE RAIN FELL FAST THE AIR GREW COOL AND THE PEOPLE WERE RETIRING TO THEIR HOMES WITH A GESTURE OF IMPATIENCE THE WANDERER PASSED INTO A BYE STREET COMPARATIVELY DESERTED
8592-285135-0063 DOWN THIS SOME QUARTER OF A MILE LONG HE RUSHED WITH AN ACTIVITY I COULD NOT HAVE DREAMED OF SEEING IN ONE SO AGED AND WHICH PUT ME TO MUCH TROUBLE IN PURSUIT A FEW MINUTES BROUGHT US TO A LARGE AND BUSY BAZAAR
8592-285135-0064 WITH THE LOCALITIES OF WHICH THE STRANGER APPEARED WELL ACQUAINTED AND WHERE HIS ORIGINAL DEMEANOR AGAIN BECAME APPARENT AS HE FORCED HIS WAY TO AND FRO WITHOUT AIM AMONG THE HOST OF BUYERS AND SELLERS
8592-285135-0065 DURING THE HOUR AND A HALF OR THEREABOUTS WHICH WE PASSED IN THIS PLACE IT REQUIRED MUCH CAUTION ON MY PART TO KEEP HIM WITHIN REACH WITHOUT ATTRACTING HIS OBSERVATION
8592-285135-0066 LUCKILY I WORE A PAIR OF CAOUTCHOUC OVER SHOES AND COULD MOVE ABOUT IN PERFECT SILENCE AT NO MOMENT DID HE SEE THAT I WATCHED HIM HE ENTERED SHOP AFTER SHOP PRICED NOTHING SPOKE NO WORD AND LOOKED AT ALL OBJECTS WITH A WILD AND VACANT STARE
8592-285135-0067 I WAS NOW UTTERLY AMAZED AT HIS BEHAVIOR AND FIRMLY RESOLVED THAT WE SHOULD NOT PART UNTIL I HAD SATISFIED MYSELF IN SOME MEASURE RESPECTING HIM A LOUD TONED CLOCK STRUCK ELEVEN AND THE COMPANY WERE FAST DESERTING THE BAZAAR
8592-285135-0068 A SHOP KEEPER IN PUTTING UP A SHUTTER JOSTLED THE OLD MAN AND AT THE INSTANT I SAW A STRONG SHUDDER COME OVER HIS FRAME HE HURRIED INTO THE STREET LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AROUND HIM FOR AN INSTANT AND THEN RAN WITH INCREDIBLE SWIFTNESS THROUGH MANY CROOKED AND PEOPLE LESS LANES
8592-285135-0069 UNTIL WE EMERGED ONCE MORE UPON THE GREAT THOROUGHFARE WHENCE WE HAD STARTED THE STREET OF THE D HOTEL IT NO LONGER WORE HOWEVER THE SAME ASPECT IT WAS STILL BRILLIANT WITH GAS BUT THE RAIN FELL FIERCELY AND THERE WERE FEW PERSONS TO BE SEEN
8592-285135-0070 THE STRANGER GREW PALE HE WALKED MOODILY SOME PACES UP THE ONCE POPULOUS AVENUE THEN WITH A HEAVY SIGH TURNED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE RIVER AND PLUNGING THROUGH A GREAT VARIETY OF DEVIOUS WAYS CAME OUT AT LENGTH IN VIEW OF ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL THEATRES
8592-285135-0071 IT WAS ABOUT BEING CLOSED AND THE AUDIENCE WERE THRONGING FROM THE DOORS I SAW THE OLD MAN GASP AS IF FOR BREATH WHILE HE THREW HIMSELF AMID THE CROWD BUT I THOUGHT THAT THE INTENSE AGONY OF HIS COUNTENANCE HAD IN SOME MEASURE ABATED
8592-285135-0072 HIS HEAD AGAIN FELL UPON HIS BREAST HE APPEARED AS I HAD SEEN HIM AT FIRST I OBSERVED THAT HE NOW TOOK THE COURSE IN WHICH HAD GONE THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE AUDIENCE BUT UPON THE WHOLE I WAS AT A LOSS TO COMPREHEND THE WAYWARDNESS OF HIS ACTIONS
8592-285135-0073 AS HE PROCEEDED THE COMPANY GREW MORE SCATTERED AND HIS OLD UNEASINESS AND VACILLATION WERE RESUMED FOR SOME TIME HE FOLLOWED CLOSELY A PARTY OF SOME TEN OR TWELVE ROISTERERS
8592-285135-0074 BUT FROM THIS NUMBER ONE BY ONE DROPPED OFF UNTIL THREE ONLY REMAINED TOGETHER IN A NARROW AND GLOOMY LANE LITTLE FREQUENTED THE STRANGER PAUSED AND FOR A MOMENT SEEMED LOST IN THOUGHT THEN WITH EVERY MARK OF AGITATION PURSUED RAPIDLY A ROUTE WHICH BROUGHT US TO THE VERGE OF THE CITY
8592-285135-0075 AMID REGIONS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WE HAD HITHERTO TRAVERSED IT WAS THE MOST NOISOME QUARTER OF LONDON WHERE EVERY THING WORE THE WORST IMPRESS OF THE MOST DEPLORABLE POVERTY AND OF THE MOST DESPERATE CRIME
8592-285135-0076 BY THE DIM LIGHT OF AN ACCIDENTAL LAMP TALL ANTIQUE WORM EATEN WOODEN TENEMENTS WERE SEEN TOTTERING TO THEIR FALL IN DIRECTIONS SO MANY AND CAPRICIOUS THAT SCARCE THE SEMBLANCE OF A PASSAGE WAS DISCERNIBLE BETWEEN THEM
8592-285135-0077 THE PAVING STONES LAY AT RANDOM DISPLACED FROM THEIR BEDS BY THE RANKLY GROWING GRASS HORRIBLE FILTH FESTERED IN THE DAMMED UP GUTTERS THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE TEEMED WITH DESOLATION YET AS WE PROCEEDED THE SOUNDS OF HUMAN LIFE REVIVED BY SURE DEGREES
8592-285135-0078 AND AT LENGTH LARGE BANDS OF THE MOST ABANDONED OF A LONDON POPULACE WERE SEEN REELING TO AND FRO THE SPIRITS OF THE OLD MAN AGAIN FLICKERED UP AS A LAMP WHICH IS NEAR ITS DEATH HOUR ONCE MORE HE STRODE ONWARD WITH ELASTIC TREAD
8592-285135-0079 SUDDENLY A CORNER WAS TURNED A BLAZE OF LIGHT BURST UPON OUR SIGHT AND WE STOOD BEFORE ONE OF THE HUGE SUBURBAN TEMPLES OF INTEMPERANCE ONE OF THE PALACES OF THE FIEND GIN
8592-285135-0080 IT WAS NOW NEARLY DAY BREAK BUT A NUMBER OF WRETCHED INEBRIATES STILL PRESSED IN AND OUT OF THE FLAUNTING ENTRANCE WITH A HALF SHRIEK OF JOY THE OLD MAN FORCED A PASSAGE WITHIN RESUMED AT ONCE HIS ORIGINAL BEARING AND STALKED BACKWARD AND FORWARD
8592-285135-0081 WITHOUT APPARENT OBJECT AMONG THE THRONG HE HAD NOT BEEN THUS LONG OCCUPIED HOWEVER BEFORE A RUSH TO THE DOORS GAVE TOKEN THAT THE HOST WAS CLOSING THEM FOR THE NIGHT
8592-285135-0082 IT WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE INTENSE THAN DESPAIR THAT I THEN OBSERVED UPON THE COUNTENANCE OF THE SINGULAR BEING WHOM I HAD WATCHED SO PERTINACIOUSLY YET HE DID NOT HESITATE IN HIS CAREER BUT WITH A MAD ENERGY RETRACED HIS STEPS AT ONCE TO THE HEART OF THE MIGHTY LONDON
8592-285135-0083 LONG AND SWIFTLY HE FLED WHILE I FOLLOWED HIM IN THE WILDEST AMAZEMENT RESOLUTE NOT TO ABANDON A SCRUTINY IN WHICH I NOW FELT AN INTEREST ALL ABSORBING THE SUN AROSE WHILE WE PROCEEDED AND WHEN WE HAD ONCE AGAIN REACHED THAT MOST THRONGED MART OF THE POPULOUS TOWN
8592-285135-0084 THE STREET OF THE D HOTEL IT PRESENTED AN APPEARANCE OF HUMAN BUSTLE AND ACTIVITY SCARCELY INFERIOR TO WHAT I HAD SEEN ON THE EVENING BEFORE AND HERE LONG AMID THE MOMENTLY INCREASING CONFUSION DID I PERSIST IN MY PURSUIT OF THE STRANGER
8592-285135-0085 BUT AS USUAL HE WALKED TO AND FRO AND DURING THE DAY DID NOT PASS FROM OUT THE TURMOIL OF THAT STREET
8592-285135-0086 GAZED AT HIM STEADFASTLY IN THE FACE HE NOTICED ME NOT BUT RESUMED HIS SOLEMN WALK WHILE I
