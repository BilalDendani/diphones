6683-67218-0000 THE OTTER TERRIER HOW GREEDILY THEY SNUFF THE FISHY STEAM THAT TO EACH BLADE RANK SCENTING CLINGS SEE HOW THE MORNING DEWS THEY SWEEP THAT FROM THEIR FEET
6683-67218-0001 BESPRINKLING DROP DISPERSED AND LEAVE A TRACK OBLIQUE BEHIND NOW ON FIRM LAND THEY RANGE THEN IN THE FLOOD THEY PLUNGE TUMULTUOUS OR THROUGH REEDY POOLS RUSTLING THEY WORK THEIR WAY
6683-67218-0002 NO HOLT ESCAPES THEIR CURIOUS SEARCH WITH QUICK SENSATION NOW THE FUMING VAPOUR STINGS FLUTTER THEIR HEARTS AND JOY REDOUBLED BURSTS FROM EVERY MOUTH IN LOUDER SYMPHONIES YON HOLLOW TRUNK
6683-67218-0003 THAT WITH ITS HOARY HEAD INCURV'D SALUTES THE PASSING WAVE MUST BE THE TYRANT'S FORT AND DREAD ABODE HOW THESE IMPATIENT CLIMB WHILE OTHERS AT THE ROOT INCESSANT BAY THEY PUT HIM DOWN
6683-67218-0004 SOMERVILLE THE ABOVE IS AN ANIMATED AND BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTION OF AN OTTER HUNT AN OLD ENGLISH SPORT FAST FALLING INTO DISUSE AND THE BREED OF THE REAL OTTER HOUND
6683-67218-0005 IS EITHER EXTINCT OR VERY NEARLY SO IN STATING THIS I AM AWARE THAT THERE ARE STILL MANY DOGS WHICH ARE CALLED OTTER HOUNDS BUT IT MAY BE DOUBTED WHETHER THEY POSSESS THAT PECULIAR FORMATION
6683-67218-0006 WHICH BELONGS EXCLUSIVELY TO THE TRUE BREED FEW THINGS IN NATURE ARE MORE CURIOUS AND INTERESTING THAN THIS FORMATION AND IT SHOWS FORCIBLY HOW BEAUTIFULLY EVERYTHING HAS BEEN ARRANGED
6683-67218-0007 FOR THE INSTINCTS AND SEVERAL HABITS OF ANIMALS THE TRUE OTTER HOUND IS COMPLETELY WEB FOOTED EVEN TO THE ROOTS OF ITS CLAWS THUS ENABLING IT TO SWIM WITH MUCH GREATER FACILITY AND SWIFTNESS THAN OTHER DOGS
6683-67218-0008 THE EAR POSSESSES A SORT OF FLAP WHICH COVERING THE APERTURE EXCLUDES THE ENTRANCE OF THE WATER AND THUS THE DOG IS ENABLED TO DIVE AFTER THE OTTER WITHOUT THAT INCONVENIENCE WHICH IT WOULD OTHERWISE EXPERIENCE
6683-67218-0009 WHAT HIS LORDSHIP CONSIDERS THE LAST OF THE BREED OF THE TRUE OTTER HOUND IT WAS A PRESENT FROM SIR WALTER SCOTT
6683-67218-0010 BUT OF A DIFFERENT SEX BUT I BELIEVE WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO PROCURE ONE WITH THOSE TRUE MARKS WHICH ARE CONFINED TO THE AUTHENTIC BREED A GIPSY WAS INDEED SAID TO HAVE POSSESSED ONE BUT HE REFUSED TO PART WITH IT
6683-67218-0011 THOSE WHO SAW THE EXHIBITION OF PICTURES IN THE ROYAL ACADEMY IN EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR WILL RECOLLECT A LARGE INTERESTING AND BEAUTIFUL PICTURE BY SIR EDWIN LANDSEER
6683-67218-0012 OF A PACK OF OTTER HOUNDS THE PICTURE DESCRIBES THE HUNT AT THE TIME OF THE TERMINATION OF THE CHASE AND THE CAPTURE OF THE OTTER THE ANIMAL IS IMPALED ON THE HUNTSMAN'S SPEAR WHILE THE ROUGH SHAGGY AND PICTURESQUE LOOKING PACK
6683-67218-0013 ARE REPRESENTED WITH EYES INTENTLY FIXED ON THE AMPHIBIOUS BEAST AND HOWLING IN UNCOUTH CHORUS ROUND THEIR AGONIZED AND DYING PREY AN OTTER HUNT IS A CHEERFUL AND INSPIRITING SPORT
6683-67218-0014 AND IT IS STILL CARRIED ON IN SOME OF THE LAKES OF CUMBERLAND INDEED AS LATELY AS THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR A PACK OF OTTER HOUNDS WAS ADVERTISED IN THE NEWSPAPERS TO BE SOLD BY PRIVATE CONTRACT
6683-67218-0015 THE ALLEGED CAUSE OF THE OWNER'S PARTING WITH THEM WAS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR HAVING CLEARED THE RIVERS OF THREE COUNTIES STAFFORDSHIRE BEING ONE OF ALL THE OTTERS
6683-67218-0016 AND WILL BEAT EVERY TREE ROOT EVERY OSIER BED AND TUFT OF BULRUSHES NAY SOMETIMES THEY WILL TAKE THE WATER AND BEAT IT LIKE A SPANIEL AND BY THESE MEANS THE OTTER CAN HARDLY ESCAPE YOU
6683-67218-0017 THE OTTER SWIMS AND DIVES WITH GREAT CELERITY AND IN DOING THE LATTER IT THROWS UP SPROTS OR AIR BUBBLES WHICH ENABLE THE HUNTERS TO ASCERTAIN WHERE IT IS AND TO SPEAR IT
6683-67218-0018 IT MAY FREQUENTLY BE TRACED BY THE DEAD FISH AND FISH BONES STREWED ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RIVER THE PRINTS ALSO OF THE ANIMAL'S FEET CALLED HIS SEAL
6683-67218-0019 ARE OF A PECULIAR FORMATION AND THUS IT IS READILY TRACED THE OTTER PREYS DURING THE NIGHT AND CONCEALS HIMSELF IN THE DAYTIME UNDER THE BANKS OF LAKES AND RIVERS
6683-67218-0020 WHERE HE GENERALLY FORMS A KIND OF SUBTERRANEOUS GALLERY RUNNING FOR SEVERAL YARDS PARALLEL TO THE WATER'S EDGE SO THAT IF HE SHOULD BE ASSAILED FROM ONE END HE FLIES TO THE OTHER WHEN HE TAKES TO THE WATER
6683-67218-0021 IT IS NECESSARY THAT THOSE WHO HAVE OTTER SPEARS SHOULD WATCH THE BUBBLES FOR HE GENERALLY VENTS NEAR THEM WHEN THE OTTER IS SEIZED
6683-67218-0022 HE TURNS UPON HIS PURSUERS WITH THE UTMOST FEROCITY INSTANCES ARE RECORDED OF DOGS HAVING BEEN DROWNED BY OTTERS WHICH THEY HAD SEIZED UNDER WATER FOR THEY CAN SUSTAIN THE WANT OF RESPIRATION
6683-67218-0023 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME THAN THE DOG MISTER DANIELL IN HIS RURAL SPORTS REMARKS THAT HUNTING THE OTTER WAS FORMERLY CONSIDERED AS EXCELLENT SPORT AND THAT HOUNDS WERE KEPT SOLELY FOR THAT PURPOSE
6683-67218-0024 THE SPORTSMEN WENT ON EACH SIDE OF THE RIVER BEATING THE BANKS AND SEDGES WITH THE DOGS IF AN OTTER WAS NOT SOON FOUND IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE HAD GONE TO COUCH MORE INLAND
6683-67218-0025 AND WAS SOUGHT FOR ACCORDINGLY IF ONE WAS FOUND
6683-67218-0026 TO FIND WHICH WAY HE HAD TAKEN ON THE SOFT SAND SEE THERE HIS SEAL IMPRESS'D AND ON THAT BANK BEHOLD THE GLITT'RING SPOILS HALF EATEN FISH SCALES
6683-67218-0027 FINS AND BONES THE LEAVINGS OF HIS FEAST THE SPEARS WERE USED IN AID OF THE DOGS WHEN AN OTTER IS WOUNDED HE MAKES DIRECTLY TO LAND WHERE HE MAINTAINS AN OBSTINATE DEFENCE
6683-67218-0028 LO TO YON SEDGY BANK HE CREEPS DISCONSOLATE HIS NUMEROUS FOES SURROUND HIM HOUNDS AND MEN PIERC'D THROUGH AND THROUGH ON POINTED SPEARS THEY LIFT HIM HIGH IN AIR
6683-67218-0029 BID THE LOUD HORNS IN GAILY WARBLING STRAINS PROCLAIM THE SPOILER'S FATE HE DIES HE DIES THE MALE OTTER NEVER MAKES ANY COMPLAINT WHEN SEIZED BY THE DOGS
6683-67218-0030 OR EVEN WHEN TRANSFIXED WITH A SPEAR BUT THE FEMALES EMIT A VERY SHRILL SQUEAL IN THE YEAR SEVENTEEN NINETY SIX NEAR BRIDGENORTH ON THE RIVER WHERFE FOUR OTTERS WERE KILLED ONE STOOD THREE
6683-67218-0031 ANOTHER FOUR HOURS BEFORE THE DOGS AND WAS SCARCELY A MINUTE OUT OF SIGHT IN APRIL EIGHTEEN O FOUR THE OTTER HOUNDS OF MISTER COLEMAN OF LEOMINSTER KILLED AN OTTER
6683-67218-0032 AND TO HAVE DESTROYED FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS A TON OF FISH ANNUALLY THE DESTRUCTION OF FISH BY THIS ANIMAL IS INDEED VERY GREAT FOR HE WILL EAT NONE UNLESS IT BE PERFECTLY FRESH AND WHAT HE TAKES HIMSELF
6683-67218-0033 FOR SO SOON AS AN OTTER CATCHES A FISH HE DRAGS IT ON SHORE DEVOURS IT TO THE VENT AND UNLESS PRESSED BY EXTREME HUNGER ALWAYS LEAVES THE REMAINDER AND TAKES TO THE WATER IN SEARCH OF MORE IN RIVERS
6683-67218-0034 IT IS ALWAYS OBSERVED TO SWIM AGAINST THE STREAM IN ORDER TO MEET ITS PREY OTTERS BITE VERY SEVERELY AND THEY WILL SEIZE UPON A DOG WITH THE UTMOST FEROCITY AND WILL SHAKE IT AS A TERRIER DOES A RAT
6683-67218-0035 THE JAWS OF THE OTTER ARE SO CONSTRUCTED THAT EVEN WHEN DEAD IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEPARATE THEM AS THEY ADHERE WITH THE UTMOST TENACITY OTTERS ARE FREQUENTLY FOUND ON THE BANKS OF THE THAMES
6683-67218-0036 AND A LARGE ONE WAS CAUGHT IN AN EEL BASKET NEAR WINDSOR
