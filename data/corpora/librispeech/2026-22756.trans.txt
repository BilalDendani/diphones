2026-22756-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY DAY AFTER DAY AS HE BENT HIS STEPS HOMEWARD RETURNING FROM SOME NEW EFFORT TO PROCURE EMPLOYMENT KIT RAISED HIS EYES TO THE WINDOW OF THE LITTLE ROOM HE HAD SO MUCH COMMENDED TO THE CHILD
2026-22756-0001 AND HOPED TO SEE SOME INDICATION OF HER PRESENCE HIS OWN EARNEST WISH COUPLED WITH THE ASSURANCE HE HAD RECEIVED FROM QUILP FILLED HIM WITH THE BELIEF THAT SHE WOULD YET ARRIVE TO CLAIM THE HUMBLE SHELTER HE HAD OFFERED AND FROM THE DEATH OF EACH DAY'S HOPE
2026-22756-0002 ANOTHER HOPE SPRUNG UP TO LIVE TO MORROW I THINK THEY MUST CERTAINLY COME TO MORROW EH MOTHER SAID KIT LAYING ASIDE HIS HAT WITH A WEARY AIR AND SIGHING AS HE SPOKE THEY HAVE BEEN GONE A WEEK
2026-22756-0003 THEY SURELY COULDN'T STOP AWAY MORE THAN A WEEK COULD THEY NOW THE MOTHER SHOOK HER HEAD AND REMINDED HIM HOW OFTEN HE HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED ALREADY FOR THE MATTER OF THAT SAID KIT
2026-22756-0004 YOU SPEAK TRUE AND SENSIBLE ENOUGH AS YOU ALWAYS DO MOTHER STILL
2026-22756-0005 DON'T YOU SAY SO QUITE LONG ENOUGH KIT LONGER THAN ENOUGH BUT THEY MAY NOT COME BACK FOR ALL THAT KIT WAS FOR A MOMENT DISPOSED TO BE VEXED BY THIS CONTRADICTION
2026-22756-0006 AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HAVING ANTICIPATED IT IN HIS OWN MIND AND KNOWING HOW JUST IT WAS BUT THE IMPULSE WAS ONLY MOMENTARY AND THE VEXED LOOK BECAME A KIND ONE BEFORE IT HAD CROSSED THE ROOM
2026-22756-0007 YOU DON'T THINK THEY'VE GONE TO SEA ANYHOW NOT GONE FOR SAILORS CERTAINLY RETURNED THE MOTHER WITH A SMILE BUT I CAN'T HELP THINKING THAT THEY HAVE GONE TO SOME FOREIGN COUNTRY I SAY
2026-22756-0008 CRIED KIT WITH A RUEFUL FACE DON'T TALK LIKE THAT MOTHER I AM AFRAID THEY HAVE AND THAT'S THE TRUTH SHE SAID IT'S THE TALK OF ALL THE NEIGHBOURS AND THERE ARE SOME EVEN THAT KNOW OF THEIR HAVING BEEN SEEN ON BOARD SHIP
2026-22756-0009 WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN MY DEAR FOR IT'S A VERY HARD ONE
2026-22756-0010 THEY MAY BE WRONG OF COURSE RETURNED THE MOTHER I CAN'T TELL ABOUT THAT THOUGH I DON'T THINK IT'S AT ALL UNLIKELY THAT THEY'RE IN THE RIGHT FOR THE TALK IS THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN
2026-22756-0011 AND THEY WILL NEVER BE DISTURBED THAT DON'T SEEM VERY FAR OUT OF THE WAY NOW DO IT KIT SCRATCHED HIS HEAD MOURNFULLY IN RELUCTANT ADMISSION THAT IT DID NOT AND CLAMBERING UP TO THE OLD NAIL TOOK DOWN THE CAGE
2026-22756-0012 AND SET HIMSELF TO CLEAN IT AND TO FEED THE BIRD HIS THOUGHTS REVERTING FROM THIS OCCUPATION TO THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN WHO HAD GIVEN HIM THE SHILLING HE SUDDENLY RECOLLECTED THAT THAT WAS THE VERY DAY NAY NEARLY THE VERY HOUR
2026-22756-0013 AT WHICH THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD SAID HE SHOULD BE AT THE NOTARY'S HOUSE AGAIN HE NO SOONER REMEMBERED THIS THAN HE HUNG UP THE CAGE WITH GREAT PRECIPITATION AND HASTILY EXPLAINING THE NATURE OF HIS ERRAND WENT OFF AT FULL SPEED TO THE APPOINTED PLACE
2026-22756-0014 IT WAS SOME TWO MINUTES AFTER THE TIME WHEN HE REACHED THE SPOT WHICH WAS A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM HIS HOME BUT BY GREAT GOOD LUCK THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD NOT YET ARRIVED AT LEAST THERE WAS NO PONY CHAISE TO BE SEEN
2026-22756-0015 AND IT WAS NOT LIKELY THAT HE HAD COME AND GONE AGAIN IN SO SHORT A SPACE GREATLY RELIEVED TO FIND THAT HE WAS NOT TOO LATE KIT LEANT AGAINST A LAMP POST TO TAKE BREATH AND WAITED THE ADVENT OF THE PONY AND HIS CHARGE SURE ENOUGH BEFORE LONG
2026-22756-0016 THE PONY CAME TROTTING ROUND THE CORNER OF THE STREET LOOKING AS OBSTINATE AS PONY MIGHT AND PICKING HIS STEPS AS IF HE WERE SPYING ABOUT FOR THE CLEANEST PLACES AND WOULD BY NO MEANS DIRTY HIS FEET OR HURRY HIMSELF INCONVENIENTLY
2026-22756-0017 BEHIND THE PONY SAT THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN AND BY THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S SIDE SAT THE LITTLE OLD LADY CARRYING JUST SUCH A NOSEGAY AS SHE HAD BROUGHT BEFORE THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE OLD LADY THE PONY AND THE CHAISE
2026-22756-0018 CAME UP THE STREET IN PERFECT UNANIMITY UNTIL THEY ARRIVED WITHIN SOME HALF A DOZEN DOORS OF THE NOTARY'S HOUSE WHEN THE PONY DECEIVED BY A BRASS PLATE BENEATH A TAILOR'S KNOCKER CAME TO A HALT AND MAINTAINED BY A STURDY SILENCE THAT THAT WAS THE HOUSE THEY WANTED
2026-22756-0019 THIS IS NOT THE PLACE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE PONY LOOKED WITH GREAT ATTENTION INTO A FIRE PLUG WHICH WAS NEAR HIM
2026-22756-0020 THE PONY HAVING THOROUGHLY SATISFIED HIMSELF AS TO THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF THE FIRE PLUG LOOKED INTO THE AIR AFTER HIS OLD ENEMIES THE FLIES
2026-22756-0021 HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND WHISKED HIS TAIL AFTER WHICH HE APPEARED FULL OF THOUGHT BUT QUITE COMFORTABLE AND COLLECTED THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAVING EXHAUSTED HIS POWERS OF PERSUASION ALIGHTED TO LEAD HIM WHEREUPON THE PONY PERHAPS BECAUSE HE HELD THIS TO BE A SUFFICIENT CONCESSION
2026-22756-0022 PERHAPS BECAUSE HE HAPPENED TO CATCH SIGHT OF THE OTHER BRASS PLATE OR PERHAPS BECAUSE HE WAS IN A SPITEFUL HUMOUR DARTED OFF WITH THE OLD LADY AND STOPPED AT THE RIGHT HOUSE LEAVING THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO COME PANTING ON BEHIND
2026-22756-0023 IT WAS THEN THAT KIT PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE PONY'S HEAD AND TOUCHED HIS HAT WITH A SMILE
2026-22756-0024 I SAID I'D BE HERE SIR SAID KIT PATTING WHISKER'S NECK I HOPE YOU'VE HAD A PLEASANT RIDE SIR HE'S A VERY NICE LITTLE PONY MY
2026-22756-0025 SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN THIS IS AN UNCOMMON LAD A GOOD LAD I'M SURE I'M SURE HE IS REJOINED THE OLD LADY
2026-22756-0026 KIT ACKNOWLEDGED THESE EXPRESSIONS OF CONFIDENCE BY TOUCHING HIS HAT AGAIN AND BLUSHING VERY MUCH THE OLD GENTLEMAN THEN HANDED THE OLD LADY OUT AND AFTER LOOKING AT HIM WITH AN APPROVING SMILE THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE TALKING ABOUT HIM AS THEY WENT
2026-22756-0027 KIT COULD NOT HELP FEELING PRESENTLY MISTER WITHERDEN SMELLING VERY HARD AT THE NOSEGAY CAME TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED AT HIM AND AFTER THAT MISTER ABEL CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM
2026-22756-0028 AND AFTER THAT THEY ALL CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM TOGETHER WHICH KIT FEELING VERY MUCH EMBARRASSED BY MADE A PRETENCE OF NOT OBSERVING THEREFORE HE PATTED THE PONY MORE AND MORE AND THIS LIBERTY THE PONY MOST HANDSOMELY PERMITTED
2026-22756-0029 THE FACES HAD NOT DISAPPEARED FROM THE WINDOW MANY MOMENTS WHEN MISTER CHUCKSTER IN HIS OFFICIAL COAT AND WITH HIS HAT HANGING ON HIS HEAD JUST AS IT HAPPENED TO FALL FROM ITS PEG APPEARED UPON THE PAVEMENT
2026-22756-0030 AND TELLING HIM HE WAS WANTED INSIDE BADE HIM GO IN AND HE WOULD MIND THE CHAISE THE WHILE IN GIVING HIM THIS DIRECTION MISTER CHUCKSTER REMARKED THAT HE WISHED THAT HE MIGHT BE BLESSED IF HE COULD MAKE OUT WHETHER HE KIT
2026-22756-0031 OR PRECIOUS DEEP BUT INTIMATED BY A DISTRUSTFUL SHAKE OF THE HEAD THAT HE INCLINED TO THE LATTER OPINION KIT ENTERED THE OFFICE IN A GREAT TREMOR FOR HE WAS NOT USED TO GOING AMONG STRANGE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND THE TIN BOXES AND BUNDLES OF DUSTY PAPERS
2026-22756-0032 HAD IN HIS EYES AN AWFUL AND VENERABLE AIR MISTER WITHERDEN TOO WAS A BUSTLING GENTLEMAN WHO TALKED LOUD AND FAST AND ALL EYES WERE UPON HIM AND HE WAS VERY SHABBY

2026-22756-0035 AT THIS REPLY MISTER WITHERDEN BURIED HIS NOSE IN THE FLOWERS AGAIN AND WHISPERED BEHIND THE NOSEGAY TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN THAT HE BELIEVED THE LAD WAS AS HONEST A LAD AS NEED BE NOW SAID MISTER GARLAND WHEN THEY HAD MADE SOME FURTHER INQUIRIES OF HIM

2026-22756-0038 AND THE OLD LADY HURRYING TO THE WINDOW CRIED THAT WHISKER HAD RUN AWAY UPON WHICH KIT DARTED OUT TO THE RESCUE AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED
2026-22756-0039 AND OCCASIONALLY INSULTING HIM WITH SUCH ADMONITIONS AS STAND STILL
2026-22756-0040 AND THE LIKE WHICH BY A PONY OF SPIRIT CANNOT BE BORNE
2026-22756-0041 HAD AT LENGTH STARTED OFF AND WAS AT THAT MOMENT RATTLING DOWN THE STREET MISTER CHUCKSTER WITH HIS HAT OFF AND A PEN BEHIND HIS EAR HANGING ON IN THE REAR OF THE CHAISE AND MAKING FUTILE ATTEMPTS TO DRAW IT THE OTHER WAY TO THE UNSPEAKABLE ADMIRATION OF ALL BEHOLDERS
2026-22756-0042 EVEN IN RUNNING AWAY HOWEVER WHISKER WAS PERVERSE
