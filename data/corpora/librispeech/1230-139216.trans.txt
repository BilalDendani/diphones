1230-139216-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THE SAMARITAN SKIPPER I CLUNG TO THAT HEAVEN SENT BIT OF WRECKAGE EXHAUSTED AND WEARY UNTIL THE LIGHT BEGAN TO BREAK IN THE EAST
1230-139216-0001 I WAS NUMBED AND SHIVERING WITH COLD BUT I WAS ALIVE AND SAFE THAT SQUARE YARD OF GOOD AND SOLID WOOD WAS AS MUCH TO ME AS IF IT HAD BEEN A FLOATING ISLAND AND AS THE LIGHT GREW AND GREW
1230-139216-0002 AND THE SUN AT LAST CAME UP A BALL OF FIRE OUT OF THE FAR HORIZON I LOOKED ACROSS THE SEA ON ALL SIDES HOPING TO CATCH SIGHT OF A SAIL
1230-139216-0003 OF ANYTHING THAT WOULD TELL ME OF THE NEAR PRESENCE OF HUMAN BEINGS AND ONE FACT I REALIZED AT ONCE I WAS FURTHER AWAY FROM LAND THAN WHEN I HAD BEGUN MY BATTLE WITH DEATH THERE WAS NO SIGN OF LAND IN THE WEST
1230-139216-0004 THE SKY WAS NOW CLEAR AND BRIGHT ON ALL SIDES BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BREAK THE LINE WHERE IT MET THE SEA BEFORE THE FADING OF THE LIGHT ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING I HAD EASILY MADE OUT THE WELL KNOWN OUTLINES OF THE CHEVIOTS ON ONE HAND AND OF SAYS LAW ON THE OTHER
1230-139216-0005 I KNEW FROM THAT FACT THAT I HAD SOMEHOW DRIFTED FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM THE COAST THERE WAS ACCORDINGLY NOTHING TO DO BUT WAIT THE CHANCE OF BEING SIGHTED AND PICKED UP
1230-139216-0006 AND I SET TO WORK AS WELL AS I COULD ON MY TINY RAFT TO CHAFE MY LIMBS AND GET SOME WARMTH INTO MY BODY AND NEVER IN MY LIFE DID I BLESS THE SUN AS I DID THAT MORNING FOR WHEN HE SPRANG OUT OF BED IN THE NORTHEAST SKIES
1230-139216-0007 IT WAS WITH HIS FULL AND HEARTY VIGOUR OF HIGH SPRINGTIDE AND HIS HEAT WARMED MY CHILLED BLOOD AND SENT A NEW GLOW OF HOPE TO MY HEART BUT THAT HEAT WAS NOT AN UNMIXED BLESSING
1230-139216-0008 IT WAS PERHAPS ONE HOUR AFTER SUNRISE WHEN MY AGONY WAS BECOMING ALMOST INSUPPORTABLE THAT I FIRST NOTICED A WISP OF SMOKE ON THE SOUTHERN RIM OF THE CIRCLE OF SEA
1230-139216-0009 I NEVER STRAINED MY EYES FOR ANYTHING AS I DID FOR THAT PATCH OF GREY AGAINST THE CLOUDLESS BLUE IT GREW BIGGER AND BIGGER I KNEW OF COURSE THAT IT WAS SOME STEAMER GRADUALLY APPROACHING
1230-139216-0010 BUT IT SEEMED AGES BEFORE I COULD MAKE OUT HER FUNNELS AGES BEFORE I SAW THE FIRST BIT OF HER BLACK BULK SHOW UP ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE DANCING WAVES YET THERE SHE WAS AT LAST
1230-139216-0011 COMING BOWS ON STRAIGHT IN MY DIRECTION MY NERVES MUST HAVE GIVEN OUT AT THE SIGHT I REMEMBER THE TEARS ROLLING DOWN MY CHEEKS I REMEMBER HEARING MYSELF MAKE STRANGE SOUNDS WHICH I SUPPOSE WERE THOSE OF RELIEF AND THANKFULNESS
1230-139216-0012 AND THEN THE HORROR OF BEING UNSEEN OF BEING LEFT TO ENDURE MORE TORTURES OF THIRST
1230-139216-0013 FELL ON ME AND LONG BEFORE SHE WAS ANYWHERE NEAR ME I WAS TRYING TO BALANCE MYSELF ON THE GRATING SO THAT I COULD STAND ERECT AND ATTRACT HER ATTENTION SHE WAS A VERY SLOW GOING CRAFT THAT
1230-139216-0014 NOT ABLE TO DO MORE THAN NINE OR TEN KNOTS AT BEST AND ANOTHER HOUR PASSED BEFORE SHE WAS ANYWHERE NEAR ME BUT THANK GOD SHE CAME WITHIN A MILE OF ME AND I MADE SHIFT TO STAND UP ON MY RAFT AND TO WAVE TO HER
1230-139216-0015 AND THEREON SHE ALTERED HER COURSE AND LUMBERED OVER IN MY DIRECTION SHE WAS ONE OF THE UGLIEST VESSELS THAT EVER LEFT A SHIPYARD
1230-139216-0016 AND I HAD CERTAINLY NEVER BEEN SO THANKFUL FOR ANYTHING AS FOR HER SOLID AND DIRTY DECK WHEN WILLING AND KINDLY HANDS HELPED ME UP ON IT HALF AN HOUR AFTER THAT WITH DRY CLOTHES ON ME AND HOT COFFEE AND RUM INSIDE ME
1230-139216-0017 I WAS CLOSETED WITH THE SKIPPER IN HIS CABIN TELLING HIM UNDER A STRICT PLEDGE OF SECRECY AS MUCH OF MY TALE AS I FELT INCLINED TO SHARE WITH HIM
1230-139216-0018 AND HE SWORE WARMLY AND PLENTIFULLY WHEN HE HEARD HOW TREACHEROUSLY I HAD BEEN TREATED INTIMATING IT AS THE JUST THEN DEAREST WISH OF HIS HEART TO HAVE THE HANDLING OF THE MAN WHO HAD PLAYED ME THE TRICK
1230-139216-0019 THEM WAS GRAND DAYS WHEN THERE WAS MORE LICENCE AND LIBERTY IN PUNISHING MALEFACTORS
1230-139216-0020 IT SEEMED YEARS SINCE I HAD LAUGHED AND YET IT WAS ONLY A FEW HOURS AFTER ALL BEFORE I CAN SET THE LAW TO WORK ON HIM I MUST GET ON DRY LAND CAPTAIN I ANSWERED
1230-139216-0021 DUNDEE HE REPLIED DUNDEE AND WE'RE JUST BETWEEN SIXTY AND SEVENTY MILES AWAY NOW AND IT'S NEAR SEVEN O'CLOCK WE'LL BE IN DUNDEE EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON ANYWAY
1230-139216-0022 I DON'T WANT THAT MAN TO KNOW I'M ALIVE YET IT'LL BE A NICE SURPRISE FOR HIM LATER BUT THERE ARE THOSE THAT I MUST LET KNOW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO THE FIRST THING I'LL DO I'LL WIRE AND IN THE MEANTIME
1230-139216-0023 LET ME HAVE A SLEEP THE STEAMER THAT HAD PICKED ME UP WAS NOTHING BUT A TRAMP PLODDING ALONG WITH A GENERAL CARGO FROM LONDON TO DUNDEE AND ITS ACCOMMODATION WAS AS ROUGH AS ITS SKIPPER WAS HOMELY
1230-139216-0024 BUT IT WAS A VERITABLE PALACE OF DELIGHT AND LUXURY TO ME AFTER THAT TERRIBLE NIGHT
1230-139216-0025 AND WAS STILL ASLEEP WHEN HE LAID A HAND ON ME AT THREE O'CLOCK THAT AFTERNOON
1230-139216-0026 HE HAD RIGHTLY SIZED UP THE SITUATION
1230-139216-0027 THAT WAS WHERE THE REST OF MY POSSESSIONS WERE SUNK OR FLOATING
1230-139216-0028 BUT WHAT IS IT YOU'RE GOING TO DO HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO STOP HERE IN DUNDEE CAPTAIN I ASKED FOUR DAYS HE ANSWERED I'LL BE DISCHARGING TOMORROW AND LOADING THE NEXT TWO DAYS AND THEN I'LL BE AWAY AGAIN
1230-139216-0029 LEND ME THE CLOTHES AND A SOVEREIGN SAID I I'LL WIRE TO MY PRINCIPAL THE GENTLEMAN I TOLD YOU ABOUT TO COME HERE AT ONCE WITH CLOTHES AND MONEY SO I'LL REPAY YOU AND HAND YOUR SUIT BACK FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING WHEN I'LL BRING HIM TO SEE YOU
1230-139216-0030 HE IMMEDIATELY PULLED A SOVEREIGN OUT OF HIS POCKET AND TURNING TO A LOCKER PRODUCED A NEW SUIT OF BLUE SERGE AND SOME NECESSARY LINEN AYE HE REMARKED A BIT WONDERINGLY
1230-139216-0031 YOU'LL BE FOR FETCHING HIM ALONG HERE THEN AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE I WANT HIM TO TAKE YOUR EVIDENCE ABOUT PICKING ME UP I ANSWERED THAT'S ONE THING AND
1230-139216-0032 AND DON'T TELL ANYBODY HERE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED AND PASS THE WORD FOR SILENCE TO YOUR CREW IT'LL BE SOMETHING IN THEIR POCKETS WHEN MY FRIEND COMES ALONG HE WAS A CUTE MAN
1230-139216-0033 AND HE UNDERSTOOD THAT MY OBJECT WAS TO KEEP THE NEWS OF MY ESCAPE FROM SIR GILBERT CARSTAIRS
1230-139216-0034 AND THE SERGE SUIT FITTING ME VERY WELL I WAS IN THE STREETS OF DUNDEE
1230-139216-0035 SEEKING OUT A TELEGRAPH OFFICE
1230-139216-0036 WHILE I WORKED OUT A PROBLEM THAT NEEDED SOME LITTLE THOUGHT I MUST LET MY MOTHER AND MAISIE KNOW OF MY SAFETY AT ONCE I MUST LET MISTER LINDSEY KNOW TOO I KNEW WHAT MUST HAVE HAPPENED THERE AT BERWICK
1230-139216-0037 THAT MONSTROUS VILLAIN WOULD SNEAK HOME AND SAY THAT A SAD ACCIDENT HAD HAPPENED ME
1230-139216-0038 WHEN I THOUGHT OF WHAT MAISIE AND MY MOTHER MUST HAVE SUFFERED AFTER HEARING HIS TALES AND EXCUSES BUT I DID NOT WANT HIM TO KNOW I WAS SAFE I DID NOT WANT THE TOWN TO KNOW
1230-139216-0039 THEN EVERYTHING WOULD BE NOISED AROUND AND AFTER THINKING IT ALL OVER I SENT MISTER LINDSEY A TELEGRAM IN THE FOLLOWING WORDS HOPING THAT HE WOULD FULLY UNDERSTAND
1230-139216-0040 GIVE POST OFFICE PEOPLE ORDERS NOT TO LET THIS OUT
1230-139216-0041 IT SEEMED ALL WRONG SOMEHOW AND ALL RIGHT IN ANOTHER WAY AND HOWEVER BADLY PUT IT WAS IT EXPRESSED MY MEANING SO I HANDED IT IN AND MY BORROWED SOVEREIGN WITH IT
1230-139216-0042 I WENT OUT OF THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE TO STARE AROUND ME IT WAS A QUEER THING BUT I WAS NOW AS LIGHT HEARTED AS COULD BE
1230-139216-0043 I WAS VASTLY RELIEVED TO BE ABLE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH MY OWN PEOPLE WITHIN AN HOUR PERHAPS SOONER THEY WOULD HAVE THE NEWS
1230-139216-0044 AND FINDING MYSELF JUST THEN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE NORTH BRITISH RAILWAY STATION I WENT IN AND MANAGED TO MAKE OUT THAT IF MISTER LINDSEY WAS AT THE OFFICE WHEN MY WIRE ARRIVED AND ACTED PROMPTLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH IT HE AND THEY
1230-139216-0045 COULD REACH DUNDEE BY A LATE TRAIN THAT EVENING THAT KNOWLEDGE OF COURSE MADE ME IN A STILL MORE LIGHT HEARTED MOOD BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER SOURCE OF MY SATISFACTION AND COMPLAISANCE
1230-139216-0046 FOR MY REVENGE ON SIR GILBERT CARSTAIRS AND WHAT HAD BEEN A MYSTERY WAS ONE NO LONGER I WENT BACK TO THE DOCK WHERE I HAD LEFT THE TRAMP STEAMER AND TOLD ITS GOOD NATURED SKIPPER WHAT I HAD DONE
1230-139216-0047 FOR HE WAS AS MUCH INTERESTED IN THE AFFAIR AS IF HE HAD BEEN MY OWN BROTHER AND THAT ACCOMPLISHED I LEFT HIM AGAIN AND WENT SIGHT SEEING
1230-139216-0048 I WANDERED UP AND DOWN AND ABOUT DUNDEE TILL I WAS LEG WEARY AND IT WAS NEARLY SIX O'CLOCK OF THE AFTERNOON AND AT THAT TIME BEING IN BANK STREET
1230-139216-0049 I CHANCED BY SHEER ACCIDENT TO SEE A NAME ON A BRASS PLATE FIXED AMONGST MORE OF THE SAME SORT ON THE OUTER DOOR OF A SUITE OF OFFICES THAT NAME WAS GAVIN SMEATON
1230-139216-0050 I RECALLED IT AT ONCE AND MOVED BY A SUDDEN IMPULSE I WENT CLIMBING UP A LOT OF STEPS
