1422-149735-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN WHEREIN FRECKLES WINS HONOR AND FINDS A FOOTPRINT ON THE TRAIL ROUND EYED FRECKLES WATCHED THE BIRD WOMAN AND THE ANGEL DRIVE AWAY AFTER THEY WERE FROM SIGHT AND HE WAS SAFELY HIDDEN AMONG THE BRANCHES OF A SMALL TREE
1422-149735-0001 NOR SAID GOOD BYE CONSIDERING WHAT THEY HAD BEEN THROUGH THEY NEVER WOULD COME AGAIN HIS HEART SANK UNTIL HE HAD PALPITATION IN HIS WADING BOOTS STRETCHING THE LENGTH OF THE LIMB HE THOUGHT DEEPLY
1422-149735-0002 THOUGH HE WAS NOT THINKING OF BLACK JACK OR WESSNER WOULD THE BIRD WOMAN AND THE ANGEL COME AGAIN NO OTHER WOMAN WHOM HE EVER HAD KNOWN WOULD BUT DID THEY RESEMBLE ANY OTHER WOMEN HE EVER HAD KNOWN
1422-149735-0003 HE THOUGHT OF THE BIRD WOMAN'S UNRUFFLED FACE AND THE ANGEL'S REVOLVER PRACTICE AND PRESENTLY HE WAS NOT SO SURE THAT THEY WOULD NOT RETURN WHAT WERE THE PEOPLE IN THE BIG WORLD LIKE HIS KNOWLEDGE WAS SO VERY LIMITED
1422-149735-0004 THERE HAD BEEN PEOPLE AT THE HOME WHO EXCHANGED A STILTED PERFUNCTORY KINDNESS FOR THEIR SALARIES THE VISITORS WHO CALLED ON RECEIVING DAYS HE HAD DIVIDED INTO THREE CLASSES THE PSALM SINGING KIND WHO CAME WITH A TEAR IN THE EYE
1422-149735-0005 IN EXACTLY THE SAME SPIRIT IN WHICH THEY PITCHED BISCUITS TO THE MONKEYS AT THE ZOO AND FOR THE SAME REASON TO SEE HOW THEY WOULD TAKE THEM AND BE AMUSED BY WHAT THEY WOULD DO AND THE THIRD CLASS WHOM HE CONSIDERED REAL PEOPLE
1422-149735-0006 THEY HAD THINGS WORTH WHILE TO BE PROUD OF AND THEY HAD MET HIM AS A SON AND BROTHER WITH THEM HE COULD FOR THE ONLY TIME IN HIS LIFE FORGET THE LOST HAND THAT EVERY DAY TORTURED HIM WITH A NEW PANG WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE WERE THEY
1422-149735-0007 HE FAILED TO DECIDE BECAUSE HE NEVER HAD KNOWN OTHERS SIMILAR TO THEM BUT HOW HE LOVED THEM IN THE WORLD WHERE HE WAS GOING SOON WERE THE MAJORITY LIKE THEM OR WERE THEY OF THE HYPOCRITE AND BUN THROWING CLASSES
1422-149735-0008 HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE MORNING AND THE PASSING OF TIME WHEN DISTANT VOICES AROUSED HIM AND HE GENTLY LIFTED HIS HEAD NEARER AND NEARER THEY CAME AND AS THE HEAVY WAGONS RUMBLED DOWN THE EAST TRAIL
1422-149735-0009 HE COULD HEAR THEM PLAINLY THE GANG WERE SHOUTING THEMSELVES HOARSE FOR THE LIMBERLOST GUARD FRECKLES DID NOT FEEL THAT HE DESERVED IT HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO BE ABLE TO GO TO THE MEN AND EXPLAIN BUT TO MC LEAN ONLY COULD HE TELL HIS STORY
1422-149735-0010 AT THE SIGHT OF FRECKLES THE MEN THREW UP THEIR HATS AND CHEERED MC LEAN SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM WARMLY BUT BIG DUNCAN GATHERED HIM INTO HIS ARMS AND HUGGED HIM AS A BEAR AND CHOKED OVER A FEW WORDS OF PRAISE
1422-149735-0011 THE GANG DROVE IN AND FINISHED FELLING THE TREE MC LEAN WAS ANGRY BEYOND MEASURE AT THIS ATTEMPT ON HIS PROPERTY FOR IN THEIR HASTE TO FELL THE TREE THE THIEVES HAD CUT TOO HIGH AND WASTED A FOOT AND A HALF OF VALUABLE TIMBER
1422-149735-0012 WHEN THE LAST WAGON ROLLED AWAY MC LEAN SAT ON THE STUMP AND FRECKLES TOLD THE STORY HE WAS ACHING TO TELL THE BOSS SCARCELY COULD BELIEVE HIS SENSES ALSO HE WAS MUCH DISAPPOINTED
1422-149735-0013 I HAVE BEEN ALMOST PRAYING ALL THE WAY OVER FRECKLES HE SAID THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SOME EVIDENCE BY WHICH WE COULD ARREST THOSE FELLOWS AND GET THEM OUT OF OUR WAY BUT THIS WILL NEVER DO WE CAN'T MIX UP THOSE WOMEN IN IT
1422-149735-0014 THEY HAVE HELPED YOU SAVE ME THE TREE AND MY WAGER AS WELL GOING ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS SHE DOES THE BIRD WOMAN NEVER COULD BE EXPECTED TO TESTIFY AGAINST THEM NO INDEED NOR THE ANGEL EITHER SIR SAID FRECKLES THE ANGEL
1422-149735-0015 SHE IS A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL AND SHE APPEARS TO BE UTTERLY FREE FROM THE LEAST PARTICLE OF FALSE PRIDE OR FOOLISHNESS I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY HER FATHER RISKS SUCH A JEWEL IN THIS PLACE HE'S DARING IT BECAUSE SHE IS A JEWEL SIR SAID FRECKLES EAGERLY
1422-149735-0016 WHY SHE'S TRUSTING A RATTLESNAKE TO RATTLE BEFORE IT STRIKES HER AND OF COURSE SHE THINKS SHE CAN TRUST MANKIND AS WELL THE MAN ISN'T MADE WHO WOULDN'T LAY DOWN THE LIFE OF HIM FOR HER SHE DOESN'T NEED ANY CARE
1422-149735-0017 AND CLIPPING ALL AROUND THE HEADS AND HEELS OF THEM AND I'M DAMNED SIR IF I BELIEVE SHE'D CARED A RAP IF SHE'D HIT I NEVER SAW MUCH SHOOTING BUT IF THAT WASN'T THE NEAREST TO MISS I EVER WANT TO SEE SCARED THE LIFE NEAR OUT OF ME BODY WITH THE FEAR THAT SHE'D DROP ONE OF THEM
1422-149735-0018 NOW WILL THEY COME BACK ASKED MC LEAN OF COURSE SAID FRECKLES THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE TAKING THAT YOU COULD STAKE YOUR LIFE ON IT THEY'LL BE COMING BACK AT LEAST BLACK JACK WILL WESSNER MAY NOT HAVE THE PLUCK
1422-149735-0019 UNLESS HE IS HALF DRUNK THEN HE'D BE A TERROR AND THE NEXT TIME FRECKLES HESITATED WHAT IT WILL BE A QUESTION OF WHO SHOOTS FIRST AND STRAIGHTEST
1422-149735-0020 JACK HAS BEEN SHOOTING TWENTY YEARS TO YOUR ONE AND IT STANDS TO REASON THAT YOU ARE NO MATCH FOR HIM WHO OF THE GANG WOULD YOU LIKE BEST TO HAVE WITH YOU NO ONE SIR SAID FRECKLES EMPHATICALLY NEXT TIME IS WHERE I RUN
1422-149735-0021 I WON'T TRY TO FIGHT THEM ALONE I'LL JUST BE GETTING WIND OF THEM AND THEN MAKE TRACKS FOR YOU I'LL NEED TO COME LIKE LIGHTNING AND DUNCAN HAS NO EXTRA HORSE SO I'M THINKING YOU'D BEST GET ME ONE OR PERHAPS A WHEEL WOULD BE BETTER
1422-149735-0022 I USED TO DO EXTRA WORK FOR THE HOME DOCTOR AND HE WOULD LET ME TAKE HIS BICYCLE TO RIDE AROUND THE PLACE AND AT TIMES THE HEAD NURSE WOULD LOAN ME HIS FOR AN HOUR A WHEEL WOULD COST LESS AND BE FASTER THAN A HORSE AND WOULD TAKE LESS CARE
1422-149735-0023 I BELIEVE IF YOU ARE GOING TO TOWN SOON YOU HAD BEST PICK UP ANY KIND OF AN OLD ONE AT SOME SECOND HAND STORE FOR IF I'M EVER CALLED TO USE IT IN A HURRY THERE WON'T BE THE HANDLEBARS LEFT AFTER CROSSING THE CORDUROY YES SAID MC LEAN
1422-149735-0024 IF THE BIRD WOMAN WAS GOING TO GIVE UP THE LITTLE CHICKEN SERIES HE WOULD YIELD TO THE SECOND GUARD SOLELY FOR THE SAKE OF HER WORK AND THE PRESENCE OF THE ANGEL IN THE LIMBERLOST HE DID NOT PROPOSE TO HAVE A SECOND MAN
1422-149735-0025 UNLESS IT WERE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR HE HAD BEEN ALONE SO LONG THAT HE LOVED THE SOLITUDE HIS CHICKENS AND FLOWERS THE THOUGHT OF HAVING A STRANGER TO ALL HIS WAYS COME AND MEDDLE WITH HIS ARRANGEMENTS
1422-149735-0026 FRIGHTEN HIS PETS PULL HIS FLOWERS AND INTERRUPT HIM WHEN HE WANTED TO STUDY SO ANNOYED HIM THAT HE WAS BLINDED TO HIS REAL NEED FOR HELP WITH MC LEAN IT WAS A CASE OF LETTING HIS SOBER BETTER JUDGMENT BE OVERRIDDEN BY THE BOY HE WAS GROWING SO TO LOVE
1422-149735-0027 THAT HE COULD NOT ENDURE TO OPPOSE HIM AND TO HAVE FRECKLES KEEP HIS TRUST AND WIN ALONE MEANT MORE THAN ANY MONEY THE BOSS MIGHT LOSE THE FOLLOWING MORNING MC LEAN BROUGHT THE WHEEL AND FRECKLES TOOK IT TO THE TRAIL TO TEST IT
1422-149735-0028 IT WAS NEW CHAINLESS WITH AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE TO CATCH IN HURRIED RIDING AND IN EVERY WAY THE BEST OF ITS KIND FRECKLES WENT SKIMMING AROUND THE TRAIL ON IT ON A PRELIMINARY TRIP
1422-149735-0029 IN THE EXCITEMENT OF YESTERDAY ALL OF THEM HAD FORGOTTEN IT HE WENT AND PICKED IT UP OH SO CAREFULLY GAZING AT IT WITH HUNGRY EYES BUT TOUCHING IT ONLY TO CARRY IT TO HIS CASE WHERE HE HUNG IT ON THE SHINING HANDLEBAR OF THE NEW WHEEL
1422-149735-0030 AND LOCKED IT AMONG HIS TREASURES THEN HE WENT TO THE TRAIL WITH A NEW EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE AND A STRANGE THROBBING IN HIS HEART HE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST AFRAID OF ANYTHING THAT MORNING HE FELT HE WAS THE VERIEST DANIEL
1422-149735-0031 BUT ALL HIS LIONS SEEMED WEAK AND HARMLESS WHAT BLACK JACK'S NEXT MOVE WOULD BE HE COULD NOT IMAGINE BUT THAT THERE WOULD BE A MOVE OF SOME KIND WAS CERTAIN THE BIG BULLY WAS NOT A MAN TO GIVE UP HIS PURPOSE
1422-149735-0032 OR TO HAVE THE HAT SWEPT FROM HIS HEAD WITH A BULLET AND BEAR IT MEEKLY MOREOVER WESSNER WOULD CLING TO HIS REVENGE WITH A DUTCHMAN'S SINGLENESS OF MIND FRECKLES TRIED TO THINK CONNECTEDLY
1422-149735-0033 SHE HAD STEPPED IN ONE MUCKY SPOT AND LEFT A SHARP IMPRESSION THE AFTERNOON SUN HAD BAKED IT HARD AND THE HORSES HOOFS HAD NOT OBLITERATED ANY PART OF IT AS THEY HAD IN SO MANY PLACES FRECKLES STOOD FASCINATED GAZING AT IT
1422-149735-0034 HE MEASURED IT LOVINGLY WITH HIS EYE HE WOULD NOT HAVE VENTURED A CARESS ON HER HAT ANY MORE THAN ON HER PERSON BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT SURELY A FOOTPRINT ON A TRAIL MIGHT BELONG TO ANYONE WHO FOUND AND WANTED IT
1422-149735-0035 WITH HIS FEET AND BAKED HARD WITH THE SUN ALMOST ALL THE WAY WHEN HE CAME TO THE BARK HE VEERED FAR TO ONE SIDE AND SMILED AT IT IN PASSING SUDDENLY HE WAS OFF THE WHEEL KNEELING BESIDE IT HE REMOVED HIS HAT CAREFULLY LIFTED THE BARK
1422-149735-0036 AND GAZED LOVINGLY AT THE IMPRINT I WONDER WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO SAY OF ME VOICE HE WHISPERED SHE NEVER GOT IT SAID BUT FROM THE FACE OF HER I BELIEVE SHE WAS LIKING IT FAIRLY WELL PERHAPS SHE WAS GOING TO SAY THAT
1422-149735-0037 THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL THOUGHT AT THE HOME WELL IF IT IS I'LL JUST SHUT ME EYES THINK OF ME LITTLE ROOM THE FACE OF HER WATCHING AND THE HEART OF HER BEATING AND I'LL RAISE THEM DAMN THEM IF SINGING WILL DO IT I'LL RAISE THEM FROM THE BENCHES
