2491-134787-0000 LITTLE GERVAIS JEAN VALJEAN LEFT THE TOWN AS THOUGH HE WERE FLEEING FROM IT HE SET OUT AT A VERY HASTY PACE THROUGH THE FIELDS TAKING WHATEVER ROADS AND PATHS PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO HIM
2491-134787-0001 WITHOUT PERCEIVING THAT HE WAS INCESSANTLY RETRACING HIS STEPS HE WANDERED THUS THE WHOLE MORNING WITHOUT HAVING EATEN ANYTHING AND WITHOUT FEELING HUNGRY HE WAS THE PREY OF A THRONG OF NOVEL SENSATIONS
2491-134787-0002 HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A SORT OF RAGE HE DID NOT KNOW AGAINST WHOM IT WAS DIRECTED
2491-134787-0003 OR HUMILIATED THERE CAME OVER HIM AT MOMENTS A STRANGE EMOTION WHICH HE RESISTED AND TO WHICH HE OPPOSED THE HARDNESS ACQUIRED DURING THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OF HIS LIFE THIS STATE OF MIND FATIGUED HIM
2491-134787-0004 HE PERCEIVED WITH DISMAY THAT THE SORT OF FRIGHTFUL CALM WHICH THE INJUSTICE OF HIS MISFORTUNE HAD CONFERRED UPON HIM WAS GIVING WAY WITHIN HIM HE ASKED HIMSELF WHAT WOULD REPLACE THIS
2491-134787-0005 AT TIMES HE WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY PREFERRED TO BE IN PRISON WITH THE GENDARMES
2491-134787-0006 IT WOULD HAVE AGITATED HIM LESS ALTHOUGH THE SEASON WAS TOLERABLY FAR ADVANCED THERE WERE STILL A FEW LATE FLOWERS IN THE HEDGE ROWS HERE AND THERE WHOSE ODOR AS HE PASSED THROUGH THEM IN HIS MARCH RECALLED TO HIM
2491-134787-0007 MEMORIES OF HIS CHILDHOOD THESE MEMORIES WERE ALMOST INTOLERABLE TO HIM IT WAS SO LONG SINCE THEY HAD RECURRED TO HIM
2491-134787-0008 IN THIS MANNER ALL DAY LONG AS THE SUN DECLINED TO ITS SETTING CASTING LONG SHADOWS ATHWART THE SOIL FROM EVERY PEBBLE
2491-134787-0009 WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY DESERTED THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE HORIZON EXCEPT THE ALPS
2491-134787-0010 IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS MEDITATION
2491-134787-0011 A JOYOUS SOUND BECAME AUDIBLE HE TURNED HIS HEAD AND SAW A LITTLE SAVOYARD ABOUT TEN YEARS OF AGE COMING UP THE PATH AND SINGING HIS HURDY GURDY ON HIS HIP AND HIS MARMOT BOX ON HIS BACK
2491-134787-0012 ONE OF THOSE GAY AND GENTLE CHILDREN WHO GO FROM LAND TO LAND AFFORDING A VIEW OF THEIR KNEES THROUGH THE HOLES IN THEIR TROUSERS WITHOUT STOPPING HIS SONG
2491-134787-0013 THE LAD HALTED IN HIS MARCH FROM TIME TO TIME AND PLAYED AT KNUCKLE BONES WITH SOME COINS WHICH HE HAD IN HIS HAND HIS WHOLE FORTUNE PROBABLY AMONG THIS MONEY THERE WAS ONE FORTY SOU PIECE
2491-134787-0014 THE CHILD HALTED BESIDE THE BUSH WITHOUT PERCEIVING JEAN VALJEAN AND TOSSED UP HIS HANDFUL OF SOUS WHICH UP TO THAT TIME HE HAD CAUGHT WITH A GOOD DEAL OF ADROITNESS ON THE BACK OF HIS HAND THIS TIME
2491-134787-0015 THE FORTY SOU PIECE ESCAPED HIM AND WENT ROLLING TOWARDS THE BRUSHWOOD UNTIL IT REACHED JEAN VALJEAN JEAN VALJEAN SET HIS FOOT UPON IT IN THE MEANTIME
2491-134787-0016 THE CHILD HAD LOOKED AFTER HIS COIN AND HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM HE SHOWED NO ASTONISHMENT BUT WALKED STRAIGHT UP TO THE MAN THE SPOT WAS ABSOLUTELY SOLITARY AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE
2491-134787-0017 THERE WAS NOT A PERSON ON THE PLAIN OR ON THE PATH THE ONLY SOUND WAS THE TINY FEEBLE CRIES OF A FLOCK OF BIRDS OF PASSAGE WHICH WAS TRAVERSING THE HEAVENS AT AN IMMENSE HEIGHT
2491-134787-0018 THE CHILD WAS STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO THE SUN WHICH CAST THREADS OF GOLD IN HIS HAIR AND EMPURPLED WITH ITS BLOOD RED GLEAM THE SAVAGE FACE
2491-134787-0019 SIR SAID THE LITTLE SAVOYARD WITH THAT CHILDISH CONFIDENCE WHICH IS COMPOSED OF IGNORANCE AND INNOCENCE MY MONEY WHAT IS YOUR NAME SAID JEAN VALJEAN
2491-134787-0020 GO AWAY SAID JEAN VALJEAN SIR RESUMED THE CHILD
2491-134787-0021 AND MADE NO REPLY THE CHILD BEGAN AGAIN MY MONEY SIR JEAN VALJEAN'S EYES REMAINED FIXED ON THE EARTH
2491-134787-0022 MY PIECE OF MONEY CRIED THE CHILD MY WHITE PIECE MY SILVER IT SEEMED AS THOUGH JEAN VALJEAN DID NOT HEAR HIM THE CHILD GRASPED HIM BY THE COLLAR OF HIS BLOUSE AND SHOOK HIM
2491-134787-0023 AT THE SAME TIME HE MADE AN EFFORT TO DISPLACE THE BIG IRON SHOD SHOE WHICH RESTED ON HIS TREASURE I WANT MY PIECE OF MONEY MY PIECE OF FORTY SOUS
2491-134787-0024 HE STILL REMAINED SEATED HIS EYES WERE TROUBLED
2491-134787-0025 IN A SORT OF AMAZEMENT THEN HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TOWARDS HIS CUDGEL AND CRIED IN A TERRIBLE VOICE
2491-134787-0026 LITTLE GERVAIS I GIVE ME BACK MY FORTY SOUS IF YOU PLEASE TAKE YOUR FOOT AWAY SIR IF YOU PLEASE THEN IRRITATED THOUGH HE WAS SO SMALL AND BECOMING ALMOST MENACING
2491-134787-0027 COME NOW WILL YOU TAKE YOUR FOOT AWAY TAKE YOUR FOOT AWAY OR WE'LL SEE AH IT'S STILL YOU SAID JEAN VALJEAN AND RISING ABRUPTLY TO HIS FEET HIS FOOT STILL RESTING ON THE SILVER PIECE HE ADDED
2491-134787-0028 WILL YOU TAKE YOURSELF OFF THE FRIGHTENED CHILD LOOKED AT HIM THEN BEGAN TO TREMBLE FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND AFTER A FEW MOMENTS OF STUPOR HE SET OUT
2491-134787-0029 OR TO UTTER A CRY NEVERTHELESS
2491-134787-0030 AND JEAN VALJEAN HEARD HIM SOBBING IN THE MIDST OF HIS OWN REVERY
2491-134787-0031 THE SUN HAD SET
2491-134787-0032 HE HAD EATEN NOTHING ALL DAY IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE WAS FEVERISH HE HAD REMAINED STANDING AND HAD NOT CHANGED HIS ATTITUDE AFTER THE CHILD'S FLIGHT
2491-134787-0033 THE BREATH HEAVED HIS CHEST AT LONG AND IRREGULAR INTERVALS HIS GAZE FIXED TEN OR TWELVE PACES IN FRONT OF HIM SEEMED TO BE SCRUTINIZING WITH PROFOUND ATTENTION
2491-134787-0034 THE SHAPE OF AN ANCIENT FRAGMENT OF BLUE EARTHENWARE WHICH HAD FALLEN IN THE GRASS ALL AT ONCE HE SHIVERED HE HAD JUST BEGUN TO FEEL THE CHILL OF EVENING HE SETTLED HIS CAP MORE FIRMLY ON HIS BROW
2491-134787-0035 SOUGHT MECHANICALLY TO CROSS AND BUTTON HIS BLOUSE ADVANCED A STEP AND STOPPED TO PICK UP HIS CUDGEL AT THAT MOMENT HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE FORTY SOU PIECE WHICH HIS FOOT HAD HALF GROUND INTO THE EARTH
2491-134787-0036 AND WHICH WAS SHINING AMONG THE PEBBLES IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD RECEIVED A GALVANIC SHOCK WHAT IS THIS HE MUTTERED BETWEEN HIS TEETH HE RECOILED THREE PACES THEN HALTED
2491-134787-0037 WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DETACH HIS GAZE FROM THE SPOT WHICH HIS FOOT HAD TRODDEN BUT AN INSTANT BEFORE AS THOUGH THE THING WHICH LAY GLITTERING THERE IN THE GLOOM HAD BEEN AN OPEN EYE RIVETED UPON HIM
2491-134787-0038 SEIZED IT AND STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP AGAIN AND BEGAN TO GAZE AFAR OFF OVER THE PLAIN AT THE SAME TIME CASTING HIS EYES TOWARDS ALL POINTS OF THE HORIZON AS HE STOOD THERE ERECT AND SHIVERING LIKE A TERRIFIED WILD ANIMAL WHICH IS SEEKING REFUGE
2491-134787-0039 HE SAW NOTHING NIGHT WAS FALLING THE PLAIN WAS COLD AND VAGUE GREAT BANKS OF VIOLET HAZE WERE RISING IN THE GLEAM OF THE TWILIGHT HE SAID
2491-134787-0040 AH AND SET OUT RAPIDLY IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE CHILD HAD DISAPPEARED AFTER ABOUT THIRTY PACES HE PAUSED LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND SAW NOTHING THEN HE SHOUTED WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
2491-134787-0041 LITTLE GERVAIS LITTLE GERVAIS HE PAUSED AND WAITED THERE WAS NO REPLY THE LANDSCAPE WAS GLOOMY AND DESERTED
2491-134787-0042 HE WAS ENCOMPASSED BY SPACE THERE WAS NOTHING AROUND HIM BUT AN OBSCURITY IN WHICH HIS GAZE WAS LOST AND A SILENCE WHICH ENGULFED HIS VOICE
2491-134787-0043 AN ICY NORTH WIND WAS BLOWING AND IMPARTED TO THINGS AROUND HIM A SORT OF LUGUBRIOUS LIFE THE BUSHES SHOOK THEIR THIN LITTLE ARMS WITH INCREDIBLE FURY ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT
2491-134787-0044 THEY WERE THREATENING AND PURSUING SOME ONE HE SET OUT ON HIS MARCH AGAIN THEN HE BEGAN TO RUN
2491-134787-0045 WITH A VOICE WHICH WAS THE MOST FORMIDABLE AND THE MOST DISCONSOLATE THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO HEAR
2491-134787-0046 LITTLE GERVAIS ASSUREDLY IF THE CHILD HAD HEARD HIM
2491-134787-0047 BUT THE CHILD WAS NO DOUBT ALREADY FAR AWAY HE ENCOUNTERED A PRIEST ON HORSEBACK HE STEPPED UP TO HIM AND SAID
2491-134787-0048 HAVE YOU SEEN A CHILD PASS NO SAID THE PRIEST ONE NAMED LITTLE GERVAIS I HAVE SEEN NO ONE HE DREW TWO FIVE FRANC PIECES FROM HIS MONEY BAG AND HANDED THEM TO THE PRIEST
2491-134787-0049 WITH A MARMOT I THINK AND A HURDY GURDY ONE OF THOSE SAVOYARDS YOU KNOW I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM LITTLE GERVAIS
2491-134787-0050 SUCH PERSONS PASS THROUGH THESE PARTS WE KNOW NOTHING OF THEM JEAN VALJEAN SEIZED TWO MORE COINS OF FIVE FRANCS EACH WITH VIOLENCE AND GAVE THEM TO THE PRIEST FOR YOUR POOR HE SAID THEN HE ADDED WILDLY
2491-134787-0051 HAVE ME ARRESTED I AM A THIEF THE PRIEST PUT SPURS TO HIS HORSE AND FLED IN HASTE MUCH ALARMED
2491-134787-0052 IN THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD FIRST TAKEN IN THIS WAY HE TRAVERSED A TOLERABLY LONG DISTANCE GAZING CALLING SHOUTING
2491-134787-0053 TOWARDS SOMETHING WHICH CONVEYED TO HIM THE EFFECT OF A HUMAN BEING RECLINING OR CROUCHING DOWN IT TURNED OUT TO BE NOTHING BUT BRUSHWOOD OR ROCKS NEARLY ON A LEVEL WITH THE EARTH AT LENGTH AT A SPOT WHERE THREE PATHS INTERSECTED EACH OTHER
2491-134787-0054 HE STOPPED THE MOON HAD RISEN HE SENT HIS GAZE INTO THE DISTANCE AND SHOUTED FOR THE LAST TIME
2491-134787-0055 LITTLE GERVAIS
2491-134787-0056 HIS SHOUT DIED AWAY
2491-134787-0057 BUT IN A FEEBLE AND ALMOST INARTICULATE VOICE IT WAS HIS LAST EFFORT HIS LEGS GAVE WAY ABRUPTLY UNDER HIM
2491-134787-0058 AS THOUGH AN INVISIBLE POWER HAD SUDDENLY OVERWHELMED HIM WITH THE WEIGHT OF HIS EVIL CONSCIENCE HE FELL EXHAUSTED ON A LARGE STONE HIS FISTS CLENCHED IN HIS HAIR AND HIS FACE ON HIS KNEES
2491-134787-0059 AND HE CRIED I AM A WRETCH THEN HIS HEART BURST AND HE BEGAN TO CRY IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT HE HAD WEPT IN NINETEEN
2491-134787-0060 AS WE HAVE SEEN QUITE THROWN OUT OF EVERYTHING THAT HAD BEEN HIS THOUGHT HITHERTO HE COULD NOT YIELD TO THE EVIDENCE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON WITHIN HIM
2491-134787-0061 HE HARDENED HIMSELF AGAINST THE ANGELIC ACTION AND THE GENTLE WORDS OF THE OLD MAN YOU HAVE PROMISED ME TO BECOME AN HONEST MAN I BUY YOUR SOUL
2491-134787-0062 FROM THE SPIRIT OF PERVERSITY I GIVE IT TO THE GOOD GOD THIS RECURRED TO HIS MIND UNCEASINGLY TO THIS CELESTIAL KINDNESS HE OPPOSED PRIDE
2491-134787-0063 WHICH IS THE FORTRESS OF EVIL WITHIN US HE WAS INDISTINCTLY CONSCIOUS THAT THE PARDON OF THIS PRIEST WAS THE GREATEST ASSAULT AND THE MOST FORMIDABLE ATTACK WHICH HAD MOVED HIM YET
2491-134787-0064 THAT HIS OBDURACY WAS FINALLY SETTLED IF HE RESISTED THIS CLEMENCY THAT IF HE YIELDED HE SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THAT HATRED WITH WHICH THE ACTIONS OF OTHER MEN HAD FILLED HIS SOUL
2491-134787-0065 THROUGH SO MANY YEARS AND WHICH PLEASED HIM THAT THIS TIME IT WAS NECESSARY TO CONQUER
2491-134787-0066 AND THAT A STRUGGLE A COLOSSAL AND FINAL STRUGGLE HAD BEEN BEGUN BETWEEN HIS VICIOUSNESS AND THE GOODNESS OF THAT MAN IN THE PRESENCE OF THESE LIGHTS HE PROCEEDED LIKE A MAN WHO IS INTOXICATED
2491-134787-0067 AS HE WALKED THUS WITH HAGGARD EYES DID HE HAVE A DISTINCT PERCEPTION OF WHAT MIGHT RESULT TO HIM FROM HIS ADVENTURE AT D DID HE UNDERSTAND ALL THOSE MYSTERIOUS MURMURS WHICH WARN OR IMPORTUNE THE SPIRIT
2491-134787-0068 AT CERTAIN MOMENTS OF LIFE DID A VOICE WHISPER IN HIS EAR THAT HE HAD JUST PASSED THE SOLEMN HOUR OF HIS DESTINY
2491-134787-0069 A MIDDLE COURSE FOR HIM THAT IF HE WERE NOT HENCEFORTH THE BEST OF MEN HE WOULD BE THE WORST THAT IT BEHOOVED HIM NOW SO TO SPEAK TO MOUNT HIGHER THAN THE BISHOP OR FALL LOWER THAN THE CONVICT
2491-134787-0070 THAT IF HE WISHED TO BECOME GOOD BE MUST BECOME AN ANGEL
2491-134787-0071 HERE AGAIN SOME QUESTIONS MUST BE PUT WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY PUT TO OURSELVES ELSEWHERE DID HE CATCH SOME SHADOW OF ALL THIS IN HIS THOUGHT IN A CONFUSED WAY
2491-134787-0072 MISFORTUNE CERTAINLY AS WE HAVE SAID DOES FORM THE EDUCATION OF THE INTELLIGENCE NEVERTHELESS IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER JEAN VALJEAN WAS IN A CONDITION TO DISENTANGLE ALL THAT WE HAVE HERE INDICATED
2491-134787-0073 IF THESE IDEAS OCCURRED TO HIM HE BUT CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF RATHER THAN SAW THEM
2491-134787-0074 ON EMERGING FROM THAT BLACK AND DEFORMED THING WHICH IS CALLED THE GALLEYS THE BISHOP HAD HURT HIS SOUL
2491-134787-0075 THE FUTURE LIFE THE POSSIBLE LIFE WHICH OFFERED ITSELF TO HIM HENCEFORTH ALL PURE AND RADIANT FILLED HIM WITH TREMORS AND ANXIETY HE NO LONGER KNEW WHERE HE REALLY WAS LIKE AN OWL
2491-134787-0076 WHO SHOULD SUDDENLY SEE THE SUN RISE THE CONVICT HAD BEEN DAZZLED AND BLINDED AS IT WERE BY VIRTUE THAT WHICH WAS CERTAIN THAT WHICH HE DID NOT DOUBT WAS THAT HE WAS NO LONGER THE SAME MAN
2491-134787-0077 THAT EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM WAS CHANGED THAT IT WAS NO LONGER IN HIS POWER TO MAKE IT AS THOUGH THE BISHOP HAD NOT SPOKEN TO HIM AND HAD NOT TOUCHED HIM IN THIS STATE OF MIND HE HAD ENCOUNTERED LITTLE GERVAIS
2491-134787-0078 AND HAD ROBBED HIM OF HIS FORTY SOUS WHY
2491-134787-0079 WAS THIS THE LAST EFFECT AND THE SUPREME EFFORT AS IT WERE OF THE EVIL THOUGHTS WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT AWAY FROM THE GALLEYS A REMNANT OF IMPULSE A RESULT OF WHAT IS CALLED IN STATICS ACQUIRED FORCE IT WAS THAT
2491-134787-0080 AND IT WAS ALSO PERHAPS EVEN LESS THAN THAT LET US SAY IT SIMPLY IT WAS NOT HE WHO STOLE IT WAS NOT THE MAN IT WAS THE BEAST WHO BY HABIT AND INSTINCT HAD SIMPLY PLACED HIS FOOT UPON THAT MONEY
2491-134787-0081 WHILE THE INTELLIGENCE WAS STRUGGLING AMID SO MANY NOVEL AND HITHERTO UNHEARD OF THOUGHTS
2491-134787-0082 HE HAD DONE A THING OF WHICH HE WAS NO LONGER CAPABLE HOWEVER THAT MAY BE THIS LAST EVIL ACTION HAD A DECISIVE EFFECT ON HIM IT ABRUPTLY TRAVERSED THAT CHAOS WHICH HE BORE IN HIS MIND AND DISPERSED IT
2491-134787-0083 PLACED ON ONE SIDE THE THICK OBSCURITY AND ON THE OTHER THE LIGHT AND ACTED ON HIS SOUL IN THE STATE IN WHICH IT THEN WAS AS CERTAIN CHEMICAL REAGENTS ACT UPON A TROUBLED MIXTURE
2491-134787-0084 BY PRECIPITATING ONE ELEMENT AND CLARIFYING THE OTHER FIRST OF ALL EVEN BEFORE EXAMINING HIMSELF AND REFLECTING ALL BEWILDERED LIKE ONE WHO SEEKS TO SAVE HIMSELF HE TRIED TO FIND THE CHILD IN ORDER TO RETURN HIS MONEY TO HIM
2491-134787-0085 THEN WHEN HE RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE HE HALTED IN DESPAIR
2491-134787-0086 I AM A WRETCH HE HAD JUST PERCEIVED WHAT HE WAS AND HE WAS ALREADY SEPARATED FROM HIMSELF TO SUCH A DEGREE
2491-134787-0087 THE HIDEOUS GALLEY CONVICT
2491-134787-0088 HIS BLOUSE ON HIS HIPS HIS KNAPSACK FILLED WITH STOLEN OBJECTS ON HIS BACK WITH HIS RESOLUTE AND GLOOMY VISAGE WITH HIS THOUGHTS FILLED WITH ABOMINABLE PROJECTS
2491-134787-0089 EXCESS OF UNHAPPINESS HAD AS WE HAVE REMARKED MADE HIM IN SOME SORT A VISIONARY THIS THEN WAS IN THE NATURE OF A VISION
2491-134787-0090 HE HAD ALMOST REACHED THE POINT OF ASKING HIMSELF WHO THAT MAN WAS AND HE WAS HORRIFIED BY HIM HIS BRAIN WAS GOING THROUGH ONE OF THOSE VIOLENT AND YET PERFECTLY CALM MOMENTS
2491-134787-0091 IN WHICH REVERY IS SO PROFOUND THAT IT ABSORBS REALITY ONE NO LONGER BEHOLDS THE OBJECT WHICH ONE HAS BEFORE ONE AND ONE SEES AS THOUGH APART FROM ONE'S SELF THE FIGURES WHICH ONE HAS IN ONE'S OWN MIND
2491-134787-0092 THUS HE CONTEMPLATED HIMSELF SO TO SPEAK FACE TO FACE AND AT THE SAME TIME ATHWART THIS HALLUCINATION HE PERCEIVED IN A MYSTERIOUS DEPTH A SORT OF LIGHT WHICH HE AT FIRST TOOK FOR A TORCH
2491-134787-0093 ON SCRUTINIZING THIS LIGHT WHICH APPEARED TO HIS CONSCIENCE WITH MORE ATTENTION HE RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT IT POSSESSED A HUMAN FORM AND THAT THIS TORCH WAS THE BISHOP
2491-134787-0094 HIS CONSCIENCE WEIGHED IN TURN THESE TWO MEN THUS PLACED BEFORE IT THE BISHOP AND JEAN VALJEAN NOTHING LESS THAN THE FIRST WAS REQUIRED TO SOFTEN THE SECOND
2491-134787-0095 BY ONE OF THOSE SINGULAR EFFECTS WHICH ARE PECULIAR TO THIS SORT OF ECSTASIES IN PROPORTION AS HIS REVERY CONTINUED AS THE BISHOP GREW GREAT AND RESPLENDENT IN HIS EYES
2491-134787-0096 SO DID JEAN VALJEAN GROW LESS AND VANISH AFTER A CERTAIN TIME HE WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING MORE THAN A SHADE ALL AT ONCE HE DISAPPEARED
2491-134787-0097 THE BISHOP ALONE REMAINED HE FILLED THE WHOLE SOUL OF THIS WRETCHED MAN WITH A MAGNIFICENT RADIANCE JEAN VALJEAN WEPT FOR A LONG TIME
2491-134787-0098 HE WEPT BURNING TEARS HE SOBBED WITH MORE WEAKNESS THAN A WOMAN WITH MORE FRIGHT THAN A CHILD AS HE WEPT DAYLIGHT PENETRATED MORE AND MORE CLEARLY INTO HIS SOUL
2491-134787-0099 AN EXTRAORDINARY LIGHT A LIGHT AT ONCE RAVISHING AND TERRIBLE HIS PAST LIFE HIS FIRST FAULT HIS LONG EXPIATION HIS EXTERNAL BRUTISHNESS HIS
2491-134787-0100 INTERNAL HARDNESS HIS DISMISSAL TO LIBERTY REJOICING IN MANIFOLD PLANS OF VENGEANCE WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE BISHOP'S THE LAST THING THAT HE HAD DONE
2491-134787-0101 THAT THEFT OF FORTY SOUS FROM A CHILD A CRIME ALL THE MORE COWARDLY AND ALL THE MORE MONSTROUS SINCE IT HAD COME AFTER THE BISHOP'S PARDON ALL THIS RECURRED TO HIS MIND
2491-134787-0102 AND APPEARED CLEARLY TO HIM BUT WITH A CLEARNESS WHICH HE HAD NEVER HITHERTO WITNESSED HE EXAMINED HIS LIFE AND IT SEEMED HORRIBLE TO HIM HIS SOUL AND IT SEEMED FRIGHTFUL TO HIM
2491-134787-0103 IN THE MEANTIME A GENTLE LIGHT RESTED OVER THIS LIFE AND THIS SOUL IT SEEMED TO HIM
2491-134787-0104 BY THE LIGHT OF PARADISE HOW MANY HOURS DID HE WEEP THUS
2491-134787-0105 WHITHER DID HE GO NO ONE EVER KNEW THE ONLY THING WHICH SEEMS TO BE AUTHENTICATED IS THAT THAT SAME NIGHT
2491-134787-0106 ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING SAW AS HE TRAVERSED THE STREET IN WHICH THE BISHOP'S RESIDENCE WAS SITUATED A MAN IN THE ATTITUDE OF PRAYER
2491-134787-0107 IN THE SHADOW IN FRONT OF THE DOOR
