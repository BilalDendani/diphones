5868-66166-0000 I LEARNED AFTERWARDS THAT SHE SAILED FAST ONLY IN THE NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENTS MY FATHER OWNED ONE QUARTER OF THE TYPHOON AND THAT IS WHY WE HAPPENED TO GO IN HER I TRIED TO GUESS WHICH QUARTER OF THE SHIP HE OWNED AND FINALLY CONCLUDED IT MUST BE THE HIND QUARTER
5868-66166-0001 THE CABIN IN WHICH WE HAD THE COSIEST OF STATE ROOMS WITH ONE ROUND WINDOW IN THE ROOF AND TWO SHELVES OR BOXES NAILED UP AGAINST THE WALL TO SLEEP IN THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF CONFUSION ON DECK WHILE WE WERE GETTING UNDER WAY
5868-66166-0002 THE CAPTAIN SHOUTED ORDERS TO WHICH NOBODY SEEMED TO PAY ANY ATTENTION THROUGH A BATTERED TIN TRUMPET AND GREW SO RED IN THE FACE THAT HE REMINDED ME OF A SCOOPED OUT PUMPKIN WITH A LIGHTED CANDLE INSIDE HE SWORE RIGHT AND LEFT AT THE SAILORS
5868-66166-0003 WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST REGARD FOR THEIR FEELINGS THEY DIDN'T MIND IT A BIT HOWEVER BUT WENT ON SINGING HEAVE HO WITH THE RUM BELOW AND HURRAH FOR THE SPANISH MAIN O I WILL NOT BE POSITIVE ABOUT THE SPANISH MAIN BUT IT WAS
5868-66166-0004 HURRAH FOR SOMETHING O I CONSIDERED THEM VERY JOLLY FELLOWS AND SO INDEED THEY WERE ONE WEATHER BEATEN TAR IN PARTICULAR STRUCK MY FANCY A THICK SET JOVIAL MAN ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OF AGE WITH TWINKLING BLUE EYES
5868-66166-0005 AND A FRINGE OF GRAY HAIR CIRCLING HIS HEAD LIKE A CROWN AS HE TOOK OFF HIS TARPAULIN I OBSERVED THAT THE TOP OF HIS HEAD WAS QUITE SMOOTH AND FLAT AS IF SOMEBODY HAD SAT DOWN ON HIM WHEN HE WAS VERY YOUNG THERE WAS SOMETHING NOTICEABLY HEARTY IN THIS MAN'S BRONZED FACE
5868-66166-0006 A HEARTINESS THAT SEEMED TO EXTEND TO HIS LOOSELY KNOTTED NECKERCHIEF BUT WHAT COMPLETELY WON MY GOOD WILL WAS A PICTURE OF ENVIABLE LOVELINESS PAINTED ON HIS LEFT ARM IT WAS THE HEAD OF A WOMAN WITH THE BODY OF A FISH HER FLOWING HAIR WAS OF LIVID GREEN
5868-66166-0007 AND SHE HELD A PINK COMB IN ONE HAND I NEVER SAW ANYTHING SO BEAUTIFUL
5868-66166-0008 CAME PUFFING UP ALONGSIDE THE TYPHOON IT WAS RIDICULOUSLY SMALL AND CONCEITED COMPARED WITH OUR STATELY SHIP I SPECULATED AS TO WHAT IT WAS GOING TO DO IN A FEW MINUTES WE WERE LASHED TO THE LITTLE MONSTER
5868-66166-0009 ONLY IT DIDN'T SEEM AS IF WE WERE MOVING THE SHORE WITH THE COUNTLESS STEAMBOATS THE TANGLED RIGGING OF THE SHIPS AND THE LONG LINES OF WAREHOUSES APPEARED TO BE GLIDING AWAY FROM US IT WAS GRAND SPORT TO STAND ON THE QUARTER DECK AND WATCH ALL THIS
5868-66166-0010 BEFORE LONG THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN ON OTHER SIDE BUT STRETCHES OF LOW SWAMPY LAND COVERED WITH STUNTED CYPRESS TREES FROM WHICH DROOPED DELICATE STREAMERS OF SPANISH MOSS
5868-66166-0011 I TURNED AND LOOKED NEW ORLEANS WAS JUST A COLORLESS MASS OF SOMETHING IN THE DISTANCE
5868-66166-0012 UPON WHICH THE SUN SHIMMERED FOR A MOMENT WAS NO BIGGER THAN THE TOP OF OLD AUNT CHLOE'S THIMBLE WHAT DO I REMEMBER NEXT THE GRAY SKY AND THE FRETFUL BLUE WATERS OF THE GULF THE STEAM TUG HAD LONG SINCE LET SLIP HER HAWSERS
5868-66166-0013 I HAD BEEN STANDING BY MY FATHER NEAR THE WHEEL HOUSE ALL THIS WHILE OBSERVING THINGS WITH THAT NICETY OF PERCEPTION WHICH BELONGS ONLY TO CHILDREN BUT NOW THE DEW BEGAN FALLING AND WE WENT BELOW TO HAVE SUPPER
5868-66166-0014 THE FRESH FRUIT AND MILK AND THE SLICES OF COLD CHICKEN LOOKED VERY NICE YET SOMEHOW I HAD NO APPETITE THERE WAS A GENERAL SMELL OF TAR ABOUT EVERYTHING THEN THE SHIP GAVE SUDDEN LURCHES THAT MADE IT A MATTER OF UNCERTAINTY
5868-66166-0015 WHETHER ONE WAS GOING TO PUT HIS FORK TO HIS MOUTH OR INTO HIS EYE THE TUMBLERS AND WINEGLASSES STUCK IN A RACK OVER THE TABLE KEPT CLINKING AND CLINKING AND THE CABIN LAMP SUSPENDED BY FOUR GILT CHAINS FROM THE CEILING SWAYED TO AND FRO CRAZILY
5868-66166-0016 NOW THE FLOOR SEEMED TO RISE AND NOW IT SEEMED TO SINK UNDER ONE'S FEET LIKE A FEATHER BED THERE WERE NOT MORE THAN A DOZEN PASSENGERS ON BOARD INCLUDING OURSELVES AND ALL OF THESE EXCEPTING A BALD HEADED OLD GENTLEMAN A RETIRED SEA CAPTAIN
5868-66166-0017 THEN MY FATHER LAUGHED BUT CAPTAIN TRUCK WOULD GROW VERY ANGRY AND VOW THAT HE WOULD HAVE WON THE GAME IN A MOVE OR TWO MORE IF THE CONFOUNDED OLD CHICKEN COOP THAT'S WHAT HE CALLED THE SHIP HADN'T LURCHED I I THINK I WILL GO TO BED NOW PLEASE I SAID
5868-66166-0018 IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR THE TYPHOON WAS PLUNGING ABOUT IN THE MOST ALARMING FASHION I WAS SPEEDILY TUCKED AWAY IN THE UPPER BERTH WHERE I FELT A TRIFLE MORE EASY AT FIRST
5868-66166-0019 FOR I MADE NO DOUBT WE SHOULD FALL IN WITH PIRATES BEFORE MANY HOURS THIS IS THE LAST THING I REMEMBER WITH ANY DISTINCTNESS AT MIDNIGHT AS I WAS AFTERWARDS TOLD WE WERE STRUCK BY A GALE WHICH NEVER LEFT US UNTIL WE CAME IN SIGHT OF THE MASSACHUSETTS COAST
5868-66166-0020 FOR DAYS AND DAYS I HAD NO SENSIBLE IDEA OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AROUND ME THAT WE WERE BEING HURLED SOMEWHERE UPSIDE DOWN AND THAT I DIDN'T LIKE IT WAS ABOUT ALL I KNEW
5868-66166-0021 I HAVE INDEED A VAGUE IMPRESSION THAT MY FATHER USED TO CLIMB UP TO THE BERTH AND CALL ME HIS ANCIENT MARINER BIDDING ME CHEER UP BUT THE ANCIENT MARINER WAS FAR FROM CHEERING UP IF I RECOLLECT RIGHTLY AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT VENERABLE NAVIGATOR WOULD HAVE CARED MUCH
5868-66166-0022 IF IT HAD BEEN ANNOUNCED TO HIM THROUGH A SPEAKING TRUMPET THAT A LOW BLACK SUSPICIOUS CRAFT WITH RAKING MASTS WAS RAPIDLY BEARING DOWN UPON US IN FACT ONE MORNING I THOUGHT THAT SUCH WAS THE CASE FOR BANG WENT THE BIG CANNON
5868-66166-0023 I HAD NOTICED IN THE BOW OF THE SHIP WHEN WE CAME ON BOARD AND WHICH HAD SUGGESTED TO ME THE IDEA OF PIRATES BANG WENT THE GUN AGAIN IN A FEW SECONDS I MADE A FEEBLE EFFORT TO GET AT MY TROUSERS POCKET BUT THE TYPHOON WAS ONLY SALUTING CAPE COD
5868-66166-0024 THE FIRST LAND SIGHTED BY VESSELS APPROACHING THE COAST FROM A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION THE VESSEL HAD CEASED TO ROLL AND MY SEA SICKNESS PASSED AWAY AS RAPIDLY AS IT CAME I WAS ALL RIGHT NOW
5868-66166-0025 AT CAPE COD THE WIND PARTED COMPANY WITH US WITHOUT SAYING AS MUCH AS EXCUSE ME SO WE WERE NEARLY TWO DAYS IN MAKING THE RUN WHICH IN FAVORABLE WEATHER IS USUALLY ACCOMPLISHED IN SEVEN HOURS THAT'S WHAT THE PILOT SAID
5868-66166-0026 I FOUND HIM IN THE FORECASTLE A SORT OF CELLAR IN THE FRONT PART OF THE VESSEL HE WAS AN AGREEABLE SAILOR AS I HAD EXPECTED AND WE BECAME THE BEST OF FRIENDS IN FIVE MINUTES HE HAD BEEN ALL OVER THE WORLD TWO OR THREE TIMES AND KNEW NO END OF STORIES
5868-66166-0027 ACCORDING TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT HE MUST HAVE BEEN SHIPWRECKED AT LEAST TWICE A YEAR EVER SINCE HIS BIRTH HE HAD SERVED UNDER DECATUR WHEN THAT GALLANT OFFICER PEPPERED THE ALGERINES AND MADE THEM PROMISE NOT TO SELL THEIR PRISONERS OF WAR INTO SLAVERY HE HAD WORKED A GUN AT THE BOMBARDMENT OF VERA CRUZ IN THE MEXICAN WAR
5868-66166-0028 AND HE HAD BEEN ON ALEXANDER SELKIRK'S ISLAND MORE THAN ONCE THERE WERE VERY FEW THINGS HE HADN'T DONE IN A SEAFARING WAY I SUPPOSE SIR I REMARKED THAT YOUR NAME ISN'T TYPHOON
5868-66166-0029 HE ADDED WHICH INCREASED MY RESPECT FOR HIM I DON'T KNOW WHY AND I DIDN'T KNOW THEN WHETHER TYPHOON WAS THE NAME OF A VEGETABLE OR A PROFESSION NOT WISHING TO BE OUTDONE IN FRANKNESS I DISCLOSED TO HIM THAT MY NAME WAS TOM BAILEY
5868-66166-0030 I DISCOVERED THAT SAILOR BEN AS HE WISHED ME TO CALL HIM WAS A PERFECT WALKING PICTUREBOOK HE HAD TWO ANCHORS A STAR AND A FRIGATE IN FULL SAIL ON HIS RIGHT ARM A PAIR OF LOVELY BLUE HANDS CLASPED ON HIS BREAST
5868-66166-0031 AND I'VE NO DOUBT THAT OTHER PARTS OF HIS BODY WERE ILLUSTRATED IN THE SAME AGREEABLE MANNER I IMAGINE HE WAS FOND OF DRAWINGS AND TOOK THIS MEANS OF GRATIFYING HIS ARTISTIC TASTE IT WAS CERTAINLY VERY INGENIOUS AND CONVENIENT A PORTFOLIO MIGHT BE MISPLACED OR DROPPED OVERBOARD
5868-66166-0032 WITH RINGS ON HER FINGERS AND BELLS ON HER TOES WAS ACCOMPANIED BY MUSIC ON ALL OCCASIONS
