2671-157947-0000 WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED THEIR SONG THE GIRL IN WHITE WENT UP TO THE PROMPTER'S BOX AND A MAN WITH TIGHT SILK TROUSERS OVER HIS STOUT LEGS AND HOLDING A PLUME AND A DAGGER WENT UP TO HER AND BEGAN SINGING WAVING HIS ARMS ABOUT
2671-157947-0001 FIRST THE MAN IN THE TIGHT TROUSERS SANG ALONE THEN SHE SANG THEN THEY BOTH PAUSED WHILE THE ORCHESTRA PLAYED AND THE MAN FINGERED THE HAND OF THE GIRL IN WHITE OBVIOUSLY AWAITING THE BEAT TO START SINGING WITH HER
2671-157947-0002 THEY SANG TOGETHER AND EVERYONE IN THE THEATER BEGAN CLAPPING AND SHOUTING WHILE THE MAN AND WOMAN ON THE STAGE WHO REPRESENTED LOVERS BEGAN SMILING SPREADING OUT THEIR ARMS AND BOWING AFTER HER LIFE IN THE COUNTRY AND IN HER PRESENT SERIOUS MOOD
2671-157947-0003 ALL THIS SEEMED GROTESQUE AND AMAZING TO NATASHA SHE COULD NOT FOLLOW THE OPERA NOR EVEN LISTEN TO THE MUSIC SHE SAW ONLY THE PAINTED CARDBOARD AND THE QUEERLY DRESSED MEN AND WOMEN WHO MOVED SPOKE AND SANG SO STRANGELY IN THAT BRILLIANT LIGHT
2671-157947-0004 SHE KNEW WHAT IT WAS ALL MEANT TO REPRESENT BUT IT WAS SO PRETENTIOUSLY FALSE AND UNNATURAL THAT SHE FIRST FELT ASHAMED FOR THE ACTORS AND THEN AMUSED AT THEM SHE LOOKED AT THE FACES OF THE AUDIENCE
2671-157947-0005 SEEKING IN THEM THE SAME SENSE OF RIDICULE AND PERPLEXITY SHE HERSELF EXPERIENCED BUT THEY ALL SEEMED ATTENTIVE TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON THE STAGE AND EXPRESSED DELIGHT WHICH TO NATASHA SEEMED FEIGNED I SUPPOSE IT HAS TO BE LIKE THIS SHE THOUGHT
2671-157947-0006 SHE KEPT LOOKING ROUND IN TURN AT THE ROWS OF POMADED HEADS IN THE STALLS AND THEN AT THE SEMINUDE WOMEN IN THE BOXES ESPECIALLY AT HELENE IN THE NEXT BOX WHO APPARENTLY QUITE UNCLOTHED SAT WITH A QUIET TRANQUIL SMILE
2671-157947-0007 NOT TAKING HER EYES OFF THE STAGE AND FEELING THE BRIGHT LIGHT THAT FLOODED THE WHOLE PLACE AND THE WARM AIR HEATED BY THE CROWD NATASHA LITTLE BY LITTLE BEGAN TO PASS INTO A STATE OF INTOXICATION SHE HAD NOT EXPERIENCED FOR A LONG WHILE
2671-157947-0008 SHE DID NOT REALIZE WHO AND WHERE SHE WAS NOR WHAT WAS GOING ON BEFORE HER AS SHE LOOKED AND THOUGHT THE STRANGEST FANCIES UNEXPECTEDLY AND DISCONNECTEDLY PASSED THROUGH HER MIND
2671-157947-0009 AND SINGING THE AIR THE ACTRESS WAS SINGING THEN SHE WISHED TO TOUCH WITH HER FAN AN OLD GENTLEMAN SITTING NOT FAR FROM HER
2671-157947-0010 AT A MOMENT WHEN ALL WAS QUIET BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF A SONG A DOOR LEADING TO THE STALLS ON THE SIDE NEAREST THE ROSTOVS BOX CREAKED AND THE STEPS OF A BELATED ARRIVAL WERE HEARD THERE'S KURAGIN WHISPERED SHINSHIN
