5489-65803-0000 LETTER THREE THE POPULATION OF SWEDEN HAS BEEN ESTIMATED FROM TWO MILLIONS AND A HALF TO THREE MILLIONS A SMALL NUMBER FOR SUCH AN IMMENSE TRACT OF COUNTRY OF WHICH ONLY SO MUCH IS CULTIVATED AND THAT IN THE SIMPLEST MANNER
5489-65803-0001 AS IS ABSOLUTELY REQUISITE TO SUPPLY THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE AND NEAR THE SEASHORE WHENCE HERRINGS ARE EASILY PROCURED THERE SCARCELY APPEARS A VESTIGE OF CULTIVATION THE SCATTERED HUTS THAT STAND SHIVERING ON THE NAKED ROCKS
5489-65803-0002 BRAVING THE PITILESS ELEMENTS ARE FORMED OF LOGS OF WOOD RUDELY HEWN AND SO LITTLE PAINS ARE TAKEN WITH THE CRAGGY FOUNDATION THAT NOTHING HIKE A PATHWAY POINTS OUT THE DOOR GATHERED INTO HIMSELF BY THE COLD LOWERING HIS VISAGE TO AVOID THE CUTTING BLAST
5489-65803-0003 ESPECIALLY IF WE TAKE INTO THE ACCOUNT THAT THEY MOSTLY LIVE ON HIGH SEASONED PROVISION AND RYE BREAD HARD ENOUGH YOU MAY IMAGINE AS IT IS BAKED ONLY ONCE A YEAR THE SERVANTS ALSO IN MOST FAMILIES EAT THIS KIND OF BREAD
5489-65803-0004 AND HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF FOOD FROM THEIR MASTERS WHICH IN SPITE OF ALL THE ARGUMENTS I HAVE HEARD TO VINDICATE THE CUSTOM APPEARS TO ME A REMNANT OF BARBARISM IN FACT THE SITUATION OF THE SERVANTS IN EVERY RESPECT
5489-65803-0005 PARTICULARLY THAT OF THE WOMEN SHOWS HOW FAR THE SWEDES ARE FROM HAVING A JUST CONCEPTION OF RATIONAL EQUALITY THEY ARE NOT TERMED SLAVES YET A MAN MAY STRIKE A MAN WITH IMPUNITY BECAUSE HE PAYS HIM WAGES
5489-65803-0006 THOUGH THESE WAGES ARE SO LOW THAT NECESSITY MUST TEACH THEM TO PILFER WHILST SERVILITY RENDERS THEM FALSE AND BOORISH STILL THE MEN STAND UP FOR THE DIGNITY OF MAN BY OPPRESSING THE WOMEN
5489-65803-0007 THE MOST MENIAL AND EVEN LABORIOUS OFFICES ARE THEREFORE LEFT TO THESE POOR DRUDGES MUCH OF THIS I HAVE SEEN IN THE WINTER I AM TOLD THEY TAKE THE LINEN DOWN TO THE RIVER TO WASH IT IN THE COLD WATER
5489-65803-0008 AND THOUGH THEIR HANDS CUT BY THE ICE ARE CRACKED AND BLEEDING THE MEN THEIR FELLOW SERVANTS WILL NOT DISGRACE THEIR MANHOOD BY CARRYING A TUB TO LIGHTEN THEIR BURDEN YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT THEY DO NOT WEAR SHOES OR STOCKINGS
5489-65803-0009 WHEN I INFORM YOU THAT THEIR WAGES ARE SELDOM MORE THAN TWENTY OR THIRTY SHILLINGS PER ANNUM IT IS THE CUSTOM I KNOW TO GIVE THEM A NEW YEAR'S GIFT AND A PRESENT AT SOME OTHER PERIOD BUT CAN IT ALL AMOUNT TO A JUST INDEMNITY FOR THEIR LABOUR
5489-65803-0010 THE TREATMENT OF SERVANTS IN MOST COUNTRIES I GRANT IS VERY UNJUST AND IN ENGLAND THAT BOASTED LAND OF FREEDOM IT IS OFTEN EXTREMELY TYRANNICAL I HAVE FREQUENTLY WITH INDIGNATION
5489-65803-0011 HEARD GENTLEMEN DECLARE THAT THEY WOULD NEVER ALLOW A SERVANT TO ANSWER THEM AND LADIES OF THE MOST EXQUISITE SENSIBILITY WHO WERE CONTINUALLY EXCLAIMING AGAINST THE CRUELTY OF THE VULGAR TO THE BRUTE CREATION
5489-65803-0012 HAVE IN MY PRESENCE FORGOT THAT THEIR ATTENDANTS HAD HUMAN FEELINGS AS WELL AS FORMS I DO NOT KNOW A MORE AGREEABLE SIGHT THAN TO SEE SERVANTS PART OF A FAMILY
5489-65803-0013 BY TAKING AN INTEREST GENERALLY SPEAKING IN THEIR CONCERNS YOU INSPIRE THEM WITH ONE FOR YOURS WE MUST LOVE OUR SERVANTS OR WE SHALL NEVER BE SUFFICIENTLY ATTENTIVE TO THEIR HAPPINESS AND HOW CAN THOSE MASTERS BE ATTENTIVE TO THEIR HAPPINESS WHO
5489-65803-0014 LIVING ABOVE THEIR FORTUNES ARE MORE ANXIOUS TO OUTSHINE THEIR NEIGHBOURS THAN TO ALLOW THEIR HOUSEHOLD THE INNOCENT ENJOYMENTS THEY EARN IT IS IN FACT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR SERVANTS WHO ARE TANTALISED BY SEEING AND PREPARING THE DAINTIES OF WHICH THEY ARE NOT TO PARTAKE
5489-65803-0015 TO REMAIN HONEST THAN THE POOR WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE NOT LED FROM THEIR HOMELY FARE SO THAT THOUGH THE SERVANTS HERE ARE COMMONLY THIEVES YOU SELDOM HEAR OF HOUSEBREAKING OR ROBBERY ON THE HIGHWAY
5489-65803-0016 THE COUNTRY IS PERHAPS TOO THINLY INHABITED TO PRODUCE MANY OF THAT DESCRIPTION OF THIEVES TERMED FOOTPADS OR HIGHWAYMEN THEY ARE USUALLY THE SPAWN OF GREAT CITIES THE EFFECT OF THE SPURIOUS DESIRES GENERATED BY WEALTH
5489-65803-0017 BRANDY AND COFFEE BEFORE THE LATTER WAS PROHIBITED AND THE FORMER NOT ALLOWED TO BE PRIVATELY DISTILLED THE WARS CARRIED ON BY THE LATE KING RENDERING IT NECESSARY TO INCREASE THE REVENUE
5489-65803-0018 SINCE THEN THE BURDEN HAS CONTINUALLY BEEN GROWING HEAVIER AND THE PRICE OF PROVISIONS HAS PROPORTIONATELY INCREASED NAY THE ADVANTAGE ACCRUING FROM THE EXPORTATION OF CORN TO FRANCE AND RYE TO GERMANY WILL PROBABLY PRODUCE A SCARCITY IN BOTH SWEDEN AND NORWAY
5489-65803-0019 SHOULD NOT A PEACE PUT A STOP TO IT THIS AUTUMN FOR SPECULATIONS OF VARIOUS KINDS HAVE ALREADY ALMOST DOUBLED THE PRICE SUCH ARE THE EFFECTS OF WAR THAT IT SAPS THE VITALS EVEN OF THE NEUTRAL COUNTRIES
5489-65803-0020 WHO OBTAINING A SUDDEN INFLUX OF WEALTH APPEAR TO BE RENDERED FLOURISHING BY THE DESTRUCTION WHICH RAVAGES THE HAPLESS NATIONS WHO ARE SACRIFICED TO THE AMBITION OF THEIR GOVERNORS I SHALL NOT HOWEVER DWELL ON THE VICES
5489-65803-0021 THOUGH THEY BE OF THE MOST CONTEMPTIBLE AND EMBRUTING CAST TO WHICH A SUDDEN ACCESSION OF FORTUNE GIVES BIRTH BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT MAY BE DELIVERED AS AN AXIOM THAT IT IS ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE INDUSTRY NECESSARY TO ACQUIRE WEALTH THAT A NATION IS REALLY
5489-65803-0022 BENEFITED BY IT THE PROHIBITION OF DRINKING COFFEE UNDER A PENALTY AND THE ENCOURAGEMENT GIVEN TO PUBLIC DISTILLERIES TEND TO IMPOVERISH THE POOR WHO ARE NOT AFFECTED BY THE SUMPTUARY LAWS
5489-65803-0023 FOR THE REGENT HAS LATELY LAID VERY SEVERE RESTRAINTS ON THE ARTICLES OF DRESS WHICH THE MIDDLING CLASS OF PEOPLE FOUND GRIEVOUS BECAUSE IT OBLIGED THEM TO THROW ASIDE FINERY THAT MIGHT HAVE LASTED THEM FOR THEIR LIVES THESE MAY BE TERMED VEXATIOUS
5489-65803-0024 STILL THE DEATH OF THE KING BY SAVING THEM FROM THE CONSEQUENCES HIS AMBITION WOULD NATURALLY HAVE ENTAILED ON THEM MAY BE RECKONED A BLESSING BESIDES THE FRENCH REVOLUTION HAS NOT ONLY RENDERED ALL THE CROWNED HEADS MORE CAUTIOUS BUT HAS SO DECREASED EVERYWHERE
5489-65803-0025 EXCEPTING AMONGST THEMSELVES A RESPECT FOR NOBILITY THAT THE PEASANTRY HAVE NOT ONLY LOST THEIR BLIND REVERENCE FOR THEIR SEIGNIORS BUT COMPLAIN IN A MANLY STYLE OF OPPRESSIONS WHICH BEFORE THEY DID NOT THINK OF DENOMINATING SUCH
5489-65803-0026 BECAUSE THEY WERE TAUGHT TO CONSIDER THEMSELVES AS A DIFFERENT ORDER OF BEINGS AND PERHAPS THE EFFORTS WHICH THE ARISTOCRATS ARE MAKING HERE AS WELL AS IN EVERY OTHER PART OF EUROPE TO SECURE THEIR SWAY WILL BE THE MOST EFFECTUAL MODE OF UNDERMINING IT
5489-65803-0027 TAKING INTO THE CALCULATION THAT THE KING OF SWEDEN LIKE MOST OF THE POTENTATES OF EUROPE HAS CONTINUALLY BEEN AUGMENTING HIS POWER BY ENCROACHING ON THE PRIVILEGES OF THE NOBLES THE WELL BRED SWEDES OF THE CAPITAL ARE FORMED ON THE ANCIENT FRENCH MODEL
5489-65803-0028 AND THEY IN GENERAL SPEAK THAT LANGUAGE FOR THEY HAVE A KNACK AT ACQUIRING LANGUAGES WITH TOLERABLE FLUENCY THIS MAY BE RECKONED AN ADVANTAGE IN SOME RESPECTS BUT IT PREVENTS THE CULTIVATION OF THEIR OWN
5489-65803-0029 AND ANY CONSIDERABLE ADVANCE IN LITERARY PURSUITS A SENSIBLE WRITER HAS LATELY OBSERVED I HAVE NOT HIS WORK BY ME THEREFORE CANNOT QUOTE HIS EXACT WORDS THAT THE AMERICANS VERY WISELY LET THE EUROPEANS MAKE THEIR BOOKS AND FASHIONS FOR THEM
5489-65803-0030 BUT I CANNOT COINCIDE WITH HIM IN THIS OPINION THE REFLECTION NECESSARY TO PRODUCE A CERTAIN NUMBER EVEN OF TOLERABLE PRODUCTIONS AUGMENTS MORE THAN HE IS AWARE OF THE MASS OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE COMMUNITY DESULTORY READING IS COMMONLY A MERE PASTIME
5489-65803-0031 BUT WE MUST HAVE AN OBJECT TO REFER OUR REFLECTIONS TO OR THEY WILL SELDOM GO BELOW THE SURFACE AS IN TRAVELLING THE KEEPING OF A JOURNAL EXCITES TO MANY USEFUL INQUIRIES THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THOUGHT OF HAD THE TRAVELLER ONLY DETERMINED TO SEE ALL HE COULD SEE
5489-65803-0032 WITHOUT EVER ASKING HIMSELF FOR WHAT PURPOSE BESIDES THE VERY DABBLING IN LITERATURE FURNISHES HARMLESS TOPICS OF CONVERSATION FOR THE NOT HAVING SUCH SUBJECTS AT HAND THOUGH THEY ARE OFTEN INSUPPORTABLY FATIGUING
5489-65803-0033 RENDERS THE INHABITANTS OF LITTLE TOWNS PRYING AND CENSORIOUS IDLENESS RATHER THAN ILL NATURE GIVES BIRTH TO SCANDAL AND TO THE OBSERVATION OF LITTLE INCIDENTS WHICH NARROWS THE MIND IT IS FREQUENTLY ONLY THE FEAR
5489-65803-0034 AND WITH THE BASIS OF ALL MORAL PRINCIPLES RESPECT FOR THE VIRTUES WHICH ARE NOT MERELY THE VIRTUES OF CONVENTION
5489-65803-0035 I AM MY FRIEND MORE AND MORE CONVINCED THAT A METROPOLIS OR AN ABODE ABSOLUTELY SOLITARY IS THE BEST CALCULATED FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE HEART AS WELL AS THE UNDERSTANDING
5489-65803-0036 WHETHER WE DESIRE TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH MAN NATURE OR OURSELVES MIXING WITH MANKIND WE ARE OBLIGED TO EXAMINE OUR PREJUDICES
5489-65803-0037 AND IN THE COUNTRY GROWING INTIMATE WITH NATURE A THOUSAND LITTLE CIRCUMSTANCES UNSEEN BY VULGAR EYES GIVE BIRTH TO SENTIMENTS DEAR TO THE IMAGINATION AND INQUIRIES WHICH EXPAND THE SOUL
5489-65803-0038 PARTICULARLY WHEN CULTIVATION HAS NOT SMOOTHED INTO INSIPIDITY ALL ITS ORIGINALITY OF CHARACTER I LOVE THE COUNTRY YET WHENEVER I SEE A PICTURESQUE SITUATION CHOSEN ON WHICH TO ERECT A DWELLING I AM ALWAYS AFRAID OF THE IMPROVEMENTS
5489-65803-0039 IT REQUIRES UNCOMMON TASTE TO FORM A WHOLE AND TO INTRODUCE ACCOMMODATIONS AND ORNAMENTS ANALOGOUS WITH THE SURROUNDING SCENE IT VISITED NEAR GOTHENBURG A HOUSE WITH IMPROVED LAND ABOUT IT WITH WHICH I WAS PARTICULARLY DELIGHTED
5489-65803-0040 IT WAS CLOSE TO A LAKE EMBOSOMED IN PINE CLAD ROCKS IN ONE PART OF THE MEADOWS YOUR EYE WAS DIRECTED TO THE BROAD EXPANSE IN ANOTHER YOU WERE LED INTO A SHADE TO SEE A PART OF IT IN THE FORM OF A RIVER
5489-65803-0041 RUSH AMONGST THE FRAGMENTS OF ROCKS AND ROOTS OF TREES NOTHING SEEMED FORCED ONE RECESS PARTICULARLY GRAND AND SOLEMN AMONGST THE TOWERING CLIFFS HAD A RUDE STONE TABLE AND SEAT PLACED IN IT
5489-65803-0042 THAT MIGHT HAVE SERVED FOR A DRUID'S HAUNT WHILST A PLACID STREAM BELOW ENLIVENED THE FLOWERS ON ITS MARGIN WHERE LIGHT FOOTED ELVES WOULD GLADLY HAVE DANCED THEIR AIRY ROUNDS
5489-65803-0043 HERE THE HAND OF TASTE WAS CONSPICUOUS THOUGH NOT OBTRUSIVE AND FORMED A CONTRAST WITH ANOTHER ABODE IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD ON WHICH MUCH MONEY HAD BEEN LAVISHED WHERE ITALIAN COLONNADES WERE PLACED TO EXCITE THE WONDER OF THE RUDE CRAGS
5489-65803-0044 AND A STONE STAIRCASE TO THREATEN WITH DESTRUCTION A WOODEN HOUSE VENUSES AND APOLLOS CONDEMNED TO LIE HID IN SNOW THREE PARTS OF THE YEAR SEEMED EQUALLY DISPLACED AND CALLED THE ATTENTION OFF FROM THE SURROUNDING SUBLIMITY
5489-65803-0045 WITHOUT INSPIRING ANY VOLUPTUOUS SENSATIONS YET EVEN THESE ABORTIONS OF VANITY HAVE BEEN USEFUL
