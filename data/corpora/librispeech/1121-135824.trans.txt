1121-135824-0000 NEITHER DID EITHER OF THEM FEEL LIKE MAKING THE LONG JOURNEY TO HIS HOME AND BACK AGAIN SO WHITEFOOT FOUND A HOLE IN A STUMP NEAR BY AND DECIDED TO CAMP OUT THERE FOR A FEW DAYS
1121-135824-0001 DANNY DECIDED TO DO THE SAME THING IN A COMFORTABLE PLACE UNDER A PILE OF BRUSH NOT FAR AWAY SO THE NEXT MORNING BOTH WERE ON HAND WHEN SCHOOL OPENED I TOLD YOU YESTERDAY THAT I WOULD TELL YOU ABOUT SOME OF DANNY'S COUSINS
1121-135824-0002 BEGAN OLD MOTHER NATURE JUST AS CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL WHO WAS LATE CAME HURRYING UP QUITE OUT OF BREATH WAY UP IN THE FAR NORTH ARE TWO OF DANNY'S COUSINS MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO HIM THAN TO ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE MOUSE FAMILY
1121-135824-0003 WHO CHANGES THE COLOR OF HIS COAT IN SUMMER HE WEARS BEAUTIFUL SHADES OF REDDISH BROWN AND GRAY BUT IN WINTER HIS COAT IS WHOLLY WHITE HE IS ALSO CALLED THE HUDSON BAY LEMMING DANNY MEADOW MOUSE THINKS HIS TAIL IS SHORT
1121-135824-0004 THAT IS SO SHORT IT HARDLY SHOWS BEYOND HIS LONG FUR HE IS ABOUT DANNY'S SIZE BUT A LITTLE STOUTER AND STOCKIER AND HIS LONG FUR MAKES HIM APPEAR EVEN THICKER BODIED THAN HE REALLY IS
1121-135824-0005 HE HAS VERY SHORT LEGS AND HIS EARS ARE SO SMALL THAT THEY ARE QUITE HIDDEN IN THE FUR AROUND THEM
1121-135824-0006 IN THAT SAME FAR NORTHERN COUNTRY IS A CLOSE RELATIVE CALLED THE BROWN LEMMING HE IS VERY MUCH LIKE BANDY SAVE THAT HE IS ALL BROWN AND DOES NOT CHANGE HIS COAT IN WINTER
1121-135824-0007 BOTH HAVE THE SAME GENERAL HABITS AND THESE ARE MUCH LIKE THE HABITS OF DANNY MEADOW MOUSE THEY MAKE SHORT BURROWS IN THE GROUND LEADING TO SNUG WARM NESTS OF GRASS AND MOSS IN WINTER
1121-135824-0008 THEY MAKE LITTLE TUNNELS IN EVERY DIRECTION UNDER THE SNOW WITH NOW AND THEN AN OPENING TO THE SURFACE THERE ARE MANY MORE BROWN LEMMINGS THAN BANDED LEMMINGS AND THEIR LITTLE PATHS RUN EVERYWHERE THROUGH THE GRASS AND MOSS
1121-135824-0009 IN THAT COUNTRY THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF MOSS IT COVERS THE GROUND JUST AS GRASS DOES HERE BUT THE MOST INTERESTING THING ABOUT THESE LEMMINGS IS THE WAY THEY MIGRATE
1121-135824-0010 TO MIGRATE IS TO MOVE FROM ONE PART OF THE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER YOU KNOW MOST OF THE BIRDS MIGRATE TO THE SUNNY SOUTH EVERY AUTUMN AND BACK EVERY SPRING
1121-135824-0011 THAT FOOD BECOMES VERY SCARCE WHERE THE LEMMINGS ARE THEN VERY MANY OF THEM GET TOGETHER JUST AS MIGRATING BIRDS FORM GREAT FLOCKS AND START ON A LONG JOURNEY IN SEARCH OF A PLACE WHERE THERE IS PLENTY OF FOOD
1121-135824-0012 THEY FORM A GREAT ARMY AND PUSH AHEAD REGARDLESS OF EVERYTHING THEY SWIM WIDE RIVERS AND EVEN LAKES WHICH MAY LIE IN THEIR WAY OF COURSE THEY EAT EVERYTHING EATABLE IN THEIR PATH
1121-135824-0013 I'M PERFECTLY SATISFIED TO LIVE RIGHT ON THE GREEN MEADOWS WHICH SHOWS YOUR GOOD COMMON SENSE SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE BY THE WAY DANNY I SUPPOSE YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH NIMBLEHEELS THE JUMPING MOUSE
1121-135824-0014 WHO ALSO IS RATHER FOND OF THE GREEN MEADOWS I OUGHT TO HAVE SENT WORD TO HIM TO BE HERE THIS MORNING HARDLY WERE THE WORDS OUT OF OLD MOTHER NATURE'S MOUTH WHEN SOMETHING LANDED IN THE LEAVES ALMOST AT HER FEET AND RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF SCHOOL
1121-135824-0015 INSTANTLY DANNY MEADOW MOUSE SCURRIED UNDER A PILE OF DEAD LEAVES WHITEFOOT THE WOOD MOUSE DARTED INTO A KNOTHOLE IN THE LOG ON WHICH HE HAD BEEN SITTING JUMPER THE HARE DODGED BEHIND A LITTLE HEMLOCK TREE
1121-135824-0016 PETER RABBIT BOLTED FOR A HOLLOW LOG STRIPED CHIPMUNK VANISHED IN A HOLE UNDER AN OLD STUMP JOHNNY CHUCK BACKED UP AGAINST THE TRUNK OF A TREE AND MADE READY TO FIGHT ONLY HAPPY JACK THE GRAY SQUIRREL
1121-135824-0017 AND CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL AND PRICKLY PORKY THE PORCUPINE WHO WERE SITTING IN TREES KEPT THEIR PLACES YOU SEE THEY FELT QUITE SAFE AS SOON AS ALL THOSE WHO HAD RUN HAD REACHED PLACES OF SAFETY
1121-135824-0018 THEY PEEPED OUT TO SEE WHAT HAD FRIGHTENED THEM SO JUST IMAGINE HOW VERY VERY FOOLISH THEY FELT WHEN THEY SAW OLD MOTHER NATURE SMILING DOWN AT A LITTLE FELLOW JUST ABOUT THE SIZE OF LITTLE WHITEFOOT BUT WITH A MUCH LONGER TAIL
1121-135824-0019 HER EYES TWINKLED NIMBLEHEELS SAW THIS AND KNEW THAT SHE WAS ONLY PRETENDING TO BE SEVERE BEFORE HE COULD REPLY JOHNNY CHUCK BEGAN TO CHUCKLE THE CHUCKLE BECAME A LAUGH AND PRESENTLY JOHNNY WAS LAUGHING SO HARD HE HAD TO HOLD HIS SIDES
1121-135824-0020 NOW AS YOU KNOW LAUGHTER IS CATCHING IN A MINUTE OR SO EVERYBODY WAS LAUGHING AND NO ONE BUT JOHNNY CHUCK KNEW WHAT THE JOKE WAS AT LAST PETER RABBIT STOPPED LAUGHING LONG ENOUGH TO ASK JOHNNY WHAT HE WAS LAUGHING AT
1121-135824-0021 GIVING US ALL SUCH A FRIGHT REPLIED JOHNNY CHUCK THEN ALL LAUGHED SOME MORE WHEN THEY WERE THROUGH LAUGHING NIMBLEHEELS ANSWERED OLD MOTHER NATURE'S QUESTIONS
1121-135824-0022 HE EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD HEARD ABOUT THAT SCHOOL AS BY THIS TIME ALMOST EVERY ONE IN THE GREEN FOREST AND ON THE GREEN MEADOWS HAD BY CHANCE HE LEARNED THAT DANNY MEADOW MOUSE WAS ATTENDING HE THOUGHT THAT IF IT WAS A GOOD THING FOR DANNY IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR HIM
1121-135824-0023 IT WAS SOME JUMP EXCLAIMED JUMPER THE HARE ADMIRINGLY
1121-135824-0024 IT ISN'T MUCH OF A JUMP TO GO OVER YOUR HEAD REPLIED NIMBLEHEELS
1121-135824-0025 I WASN'T HALF TRYING WHEN I LANDED HERE I'M SORRY I FRIGHTENED ALL OF YOU SO
1121-135824-0026 REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE HOP UP ON THAT LOG SIDE OF YOUR COUSIN WHITEFOOT WHERE ALL CAN SEE YOU NIMBLEHEELS HOPPED UP BESIDE WHITEFOOT THE WOOD MOUSE AND AS THE TWO LITTLE COUSINS SAT SIDE BY SIDE
1121-135824-0027 HIS EARS WERE MUCH SMALLER THAN THOSE OF WHITEFOOT BUT THE GREATEST DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO WERE IN THEIR HIND LEGS AND TAILS THE HIND LEGS AND FEET OF NIMBLEHEELS WERE LONG
1121-135824-0028 ANY ONE WOULD KNOW THAT HE WAS A BORN JUMPER AND A GOOD ONE WHITEFOOT POSSESSED A LONG TAIL BUT THE TAIL OF NIMBLEHEELS WAS MUCH LONGER SLIM AND TAPERING THERE SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE IS THE GREATEST JUMPER
1121-135824-0029 FOR HIS SIZE AMONG ALL THE ANIMALS IN THIS GREAT COUNTRY WHEN I SAY THIS I MEAN THE GREATEST GROUND JUMPER
1121-135824-0030 BUT TIMMY HAS TO CLIMB TO A HIGH PLACE AND THEN COASTS DOWN ON THE AIR I TOLD YOU WHAT WONDERFUL JUMPS JACK RABBIT CAN MAKE BUT IF HE COULD JUMP AS HIGH AND FAR FOR HIS SIZE AS NIMBLEHEELS CAN JUMP FOR HIS SIZE
1121-135824-0031 THE LONGEST JUMP JACK HAS EVER MADE WOULD SEEM NOTHING MORE THAN A HOP BY THE WAY BOTH NIMBLEHEELS AND WHITEFOOT HAVE SMALL POCKETS IN THEIR CHEEKS TELL US WHERE YOU LIVE NIMBLEHEELS
1121-135824-0032 I LIVE AMONG THE WEEDS ALONG THE EDGE OF THE GREEN MEADOWS REPLIED NIMBLEHEELS
1121-135824-0033 BUT I LIKE BEST TO BE AMONG THE WEEDS BECAUSE THEY ARE TALL AND KEEP ME WELL HIDDEN
1121-135824-0034 ESPECIALLY BEECHNUTS SOME OF MY FAMILY PREFER THE GREEN FOREST
1121-135824-0035 PERSONALLY I PREFER AS I SAID BEFORE THE EDGE OF THE GREEN MEADOWS DO YOU MAKE YOUR HOME UNDER THE GROUND ASKED STRIPED CHIPMUNK
1121-135824-0036 IN THE FALL I DIG A DEEP BURROW DEEP ENOUGH TO BE BEYOND THE REACH OF JACK FROST AND IN A NICE LITTLE BEDROOM DOWN THERE I SLEEP THE WINTER AWAY I HAVE LITTLE STOREROOMS DOWN THERE TOO IN WHICH I PUT SEEDS BERRIES AND NUTS
1121-135824-0037 THEN WHEN I DO WAKE UP I HAVE PLENTY TO EAT I MIGHT ADD SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE THAT WHEN HE GOES TO SLEEP FOR THE WINTER HE CURLS UP IN A LITTLE BALL WITH HIS LONG TAIL WRAPPED AROUND HIM AND IN HIS BED OF SOFT GRASS HE SLEEPS VERY SOUND INDEED
1121-135824-0038 LIKE JOHNNY CHUCK HE GETS VERY FAT BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP NOW NIMBLEHEELS SHOW US HOW YOU CAN JUMP NIMBLEHEELS HOPPED DOWN FROM THE LOG ON WHICH HE HAD BEEN SITTING AND AT ONCE SHOT INTO THE AIR IN SUCH A HIGH
1121-135824-0039 LONG BEAUTIFUL JUMP THAT EVERYBODY EXCLAIMED THIS WAY AND THAT WAY HE WENT IN GREAT LEAPS IT WAS TRULY WONDERFUL THAT LONG TAIL IS WHAT BALANCES HIM EXPLAINED OLD MOTHER NATURE
1121-135824-0040 HIS JUMPING IS DONE ONLY IN TIMES OF DANGER WHEN HE IS NOT ALARMED HE RUNS ABOUT ON THE GROUND LIKE THE REST OF THE MOUSE FAMILY
