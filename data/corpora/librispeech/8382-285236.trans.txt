8382-285236-0000 UNDER A SYRINGA BUSH THE OLD SYRINGA AT THE FOOT OF THE WADE'S LAWN WAS RATHER A TREE THAN A BUSH MANY YEARS OF GROWTH HAD GONE TO THE THICKENING OF ITS INTERLACED BOUGHS WHICH GREW CLOSE TO THE GROUND AND MADE AN IMPERVIOUS COVERT
8382-285236-0001 EXCEPT ON THE WEST SIDE WHERE A HOLLOW RECESS EXISTED INTO WHICH A SMALL PERSON BOY OR GIRL MIGHT SQUEEZE AND BE QUITE HIDDEN SUNDRY OTHER SMALL PERSONS WITH WINGS AND FEATHERS HAD DISCOVERED THE ADVANTAGES OF THE SYRINGA
8382-285236-0002 ALL MANNER OF UNSUSPECTED HOUSEKEEPINGS WENT ON WITHIN ITS FASTNESSES FROM THE LARK'S NEST IN A TUFT OF GRASS AT THE FOOT OF THE MAIN STEM TO THE ROBIN'S HOME ON THE TOPMOST BOUGH
8382-285236-0003 SOLICITOUS LITTLE MOTHERS BROODED UNSEEN OVER MINUTE FAMILIES WHILE THE HIGHLY DECORATIVE BIRD PAPA SAT ON A NEIGHBORING HEDGE CARRYING OUT HIS MISSION
8382-285236-0004 IN THE DUSK OF THE EVENING SOFT THRILLS AND TWITTERS SOUNDED FROM THE BUSH LIKE WHISPERED CONVERSATION AND VERY ENTERTAINING IT MUST HAVE BEEN NO DOUBT TO ANY ONE WHO UNDERSTOOD THE LANGUAGE
8382-285236-0005 SO ALTOGETHER THE OLD SYRINGA BUSH WAS AN INTERESTING LITTLE WORLD OF ITSELF ELLY WADE FOUND IT SO AS SHE SAT IN THE GREEN HIDING PLACE ON THE WEST SIDE CRYING AS IF HER HEART WOULD BREAK THE SYRINGA RECESS HAD BEEN HER FAVORITE SECRET
8382-285236-0006 EVER SINCE SHE DISCOVERED IT NEARLY TWO YEARS BEFORE NO ONE ELSE KNEW ABOUT IT THERE SHE WENT WHEN SHE FELT UNHAPPY OR WAS HAVING A MOOD ONCE THE BOUGHS HAD CLOSED IN BEHIND HER NO ONE COULD SUSPECT THAT SHE WAS THERE A FACT WHICH GAVE HER INFINITE PLEASURE
8382-285236-0007 FOR SHE WAS A CHILD WHO LOVED PRIVACIES AND MYSTERIES WHAT ARE MOODS DOES ANY ONE EXACTLY UNDERSTAND THEM SOME PEOPLE ATTRIBUTE THEM TO ORIGINAL SIN OTHERS TO NERVES OR INDIGESTION BUT I AM NOT SURE THAT EITHER EXPLANATION IS RIGHT
8382-285236-0008 THEY SWEEP ACROSS THE GLADNESS OF OUR LIVES AS CLOUDS ACROSS THE SUN AND SEEM TO TAKE THE COLOR OUT OF EVERYTHING GROWN PEOPLE LEARN TO CONCEAL IF NOT TO CONQUER THEIR MOODS BUT CHILDREN CANNOT DO THIS ELLY WADE LEAST OF ALL
8382-285236-0009 IT HAS WITNESSED SOME STORMY MOMENTS IN HER LIFE WHEN SHE SAT THERE HOT AND GRIEVED AND IN HER HEART BELIEVING EVERYBODY CRUEL OR UNJUST RALPH HAD TEASED HER OR CORA WHO WAS OLDER THAN SHE HAD PUT ON AIRS
8382-285236-0010 OR LITTLE KITTY HAD BEEN TROUBLESOME OR SOME SCHOOLMATE HATEFUL SHE EVEN ACCUSED HER MOTHER OF UNKINDNESS AT THESE TIMES THOUGH SHE LOVED HER DEARLY ALL THE WHILE SHE THINKS THE REST ARE ALWAYS RIGHT AND I WRONG SHE WOULD SAY TO HERSELF
8382-285236-0011 OH WELL SHE'LL BE SORRY SOME DAY WHAT WAS TO MAKE MISSUS WADE SORRY ELLY DID NOT SPECIFY BUT I THINK IT WAS TO BE WHEN SHE HERSELF WAS FOUND DEAD SOMEWHERE ON THE PREMISES OF A BROKEN HEART
8382-285236-0012 ELLY WAS VERY FOND OF DEPICTING THIS BROKEN HEART AND TRAGICAL ENDING IMAGINATIVE CHILDREN OFTEN ARE ALL THE SAME IF SHE FELT ILL OR CUT HER FINGER
8382-285236-0013 DAY ELLY HAD FLED TO THE SYRINGA BUSH WITH NO IDEA OF EVER COMING OUT AGAIN A GREAT WRONG HAD BEEN DONE HER CORA WAS GOING WITH A YACHTING PARTY AND SHE WAS NOT
8382-285236-0014 MAMMA HAD SAID SHE WAS TOO YOUNG TO BE TRUSTED AND MUST WAIT TILL SHE WAS OLDER AND STEADIER IT IS CRUEL SHE SAID WITH A FRESH BURST OF SOBS AS SHE RECALLED THE BITTER MOMENT WHEN SHE HEARD THE VERDICT IT WAS JUST AS UNKIND AS COULD BE FOR HER TO SAY THAT
8382-285236-0015 CORA IS ONLY FOUR YEARS THE OLDEST AND I CAN DO LOTS OF THINGS THAT SHE CAN'T SHE DOESN'T KNOW A BIT ABOUT CROCHETING SHE JUST KNITS AND SHE NEVER MADE SPONGE CAKE AND I HAVE AND WHEN SHE ROWS SHE PULLS THE HARDEST WITH HER LEFT HAND AND MAKES THE BOAT WABBLE
8382-285236-0016 I'VE A MUCH BETTER STROKE THAN SHE HAS PAPA SAID SO
8382-285236-0017 THEY ALL HATE ME I DON'T SUPPOSE ANYBODY WOULD CARE A BIT IF I DID DIE BUT THIS THOUGHT WAS TOO HARD TO BE BORNE YES THEY WOULD SHE WENT ON THEY'D FEEL REMORSE IF I DIED AND THEY OUGHT TO THEN THEY WOULD RECOLLECT ALL THE MEAN THINGS THEY'VE DONE TO ME
8382-285236-0018 AND THEY WOULD GROAN AND SAY TOO LATE TOO LATE LIKE THE BAD PEOPLE IN STORY BOOKS COMFORTED BY THIS IDEA SHE RESOLVED ON A PLAN OF ACTION I'LL JUST STAY HERE FOREVER AND NOT COME OUT AT ALL OF COURSE I SHALL STARVE TO DEATH
8382-285236-0019 THEN ALL SUMMER LONG THEY'LL BE HUNTING AND WONDERING AND WONDERING WHAT HAS BECOME OF ME AND WHEN THE AUTUMN COMES AND THE LEAVES FALL OFF THEY'LL KNOW AND THEY'LL SAY POOR ELLY HOW WE WISH WE'D TREATED HER BETTER SHE SETTLED HERSELF INTO A MORE COMFORTABLE POSITION
8382-285236-0020 IT ISN'T NECESSARY TO HAVE CRAMPS YOU KNOW EVEN IF YOU ARE STARVING TO DEATH AND WENT ON WITH HER REFLECTIONS SO STILL WAS SHE THAT THE BIRDS FORGOT HER PRESENCE AND CONTINUED THEIR TWITTERING GOSSIP AND THEIR SMALL DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS UNDISTURBED
8382-285236-0021 THE LARK TALKED TO HER YOUNG ONES WITH NO FEAR OF BEING OVERHEARD THE ROBINS FLEW IN AND OUT WITH WORMS THE THRUSH WHO OCCUPIED WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED THE SECOND STORY OF THE SYRINGA DISCIPLINED A REFRACTORY FLEDGLING
8382-285236-0022 AND PAPA THRUSH JOINED IN WITH A SERIES OF MUSICAL EXPOSTULATIONS ELLY FOUND THEIR AFFAIRS SO INTERESTING THAT FOR A MOMENT SHE FORGOT HER OWN WHICH WAS GOOD FOR HER A BIG BUMBLE BEE CAME SAILING THROUGH THE AIR LIKE A WIND BLOWN DRUM
8382-285236-0023 AND STOPPED FOR A MINUTE TO SIP AT A SYRINGA BLOSSOM NEXT A SOFT WHIR DREW ELLY'S ATTENTION AND A SHAPE IN GREEN AND GOLD AND RUBY RED GLANCED ACROSS HER VISION LIKE A FLYING JEWEL IT WAS A HUMMING BIRD THE FIRST OF THE SEASON
8382-285236-0024 ELLY HAD NEVER BEEN SO NEAR ONE BEFORE NOR HAD SO LONG A CHANCE TO LOOK AND SHE WATCHED WITH DELIGHT AS THE PRETTY CREATURE DARTED TO AND FRO DIPPING ITS NEEDLE LIKE BILL INTO ONE FLOWER CUP AFTER ANOTHER IN SEARCH OF THE HONEY DROP
8382-285236-0025 WHICH EACH CONTAINED SHE HELD HER BREATH NOT TO STARTLE IT BUT ITS FINE SENSES SEEMED TO PERCEIVE HER PRESENCE IN SOME MYSTERIOUS FASHION AND PRESENTLY IT FLEW AWAY ELLY'S MIND NO LONGER DIVERTED WENT BACK TO ITS UNHAPPINESS
8382-285236-0026 I WONDER HOW LONG IT IS SINCE I CAME HERE SHE THOUGHT IT SEEMS LIKE A GREAT WHILE I GUESS IT MUST BE AS MUCH AS THREE HOURS THEY'RE ALL THROUGH DINNER NOW AND BEGINNING TO WONDER WHERE I AM BUT THEY WON'T FIND ME I CAN TELL THEM
8382-285236-0027 SHE SET HER LIPS FIRMLY AND AGAIN SHIFTED HER POSITION AT THE SLIGHT RUSTLE EVERY BIRD IN THE BUSH BECAME SILENT
8382-285236-0028 I'M NOT LIKE RALPH HE'S REAL BAD TO BIRDS SOMETIMES ONCE HE TOOK SOME EGGS OUT OF A DEAR CUNNING LITTLE SONG SPARROW'S NEST AND BLEW THE YOLKS I'D NEVER DO SUCH A MEAN THING AS THAT
8382-285236-0029 BUT THOUGH SHE TRIED TO LASH HERSELF UP TO HER OLD SHARPNESS OF FEELING THE INTERRUPTION OF WRATHFUL THOUGHTS HAD SOMEWHAT SOOTHED HER MOOD
8382-285236-0030 AND ALL TO MORROW AND TO MORROW NIGHT AND THEN A YAWN PRETTY SOON I SHALL BE DEAD I SUPPOSE AND THEY'LL BE SORRY ANOTHER YAWN AND ELLY WAS ASLEEP WHEN SHE WOKE
8382-285236-0031 THE BRIGHT NOON SUNSHINE HAD GIVEN PLACE TO A DUSKY LIGHT WHICH MADE THE SYRINGA RECESS VERY DARK THE ROBINS HAD DISCOVERED HER WHEREABOUTS AND HOPPING NEARER AND NEARER HAD PERCHED UPON A BRANCH CLOSE TO HER FEET AND WERE TALKING ABOUT HER
8382-285236-0032 SHE WAS DIMLY CONSCIOUS OF THEIR VOICES BUT HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE SAYING WHY DID IT COME HERE ANY WAY ASKED MISSUS ROBIN A GREAT HEAVY THING LIKE THAT IN OUR BUSH I DON'T KNOW I'M SURE REPLIED MISTER ROBIN
8382-285236-0033 IT MAKES A STRANGE NOISE BUT IT KEEPS ITS EYES SHUT WHILE IT MAKES IT THESE GREAT CREATURES ARE SO QUEER PURSUED MISSUS ROBIN THERE IT'S BEGINNING TO MOVE I WISH IT WOULD GO AWAY I DON'T LIKE ITS BEING SO NEAR THE CHILDREN THEY MIGHT SEE IT AND BE FRIGHTENED
8382-285236-0034 THE TWO BIRDS FLITTED HASTILY OFF AS ELLY STRETCHED HERSELF AND RUBBED HER EYES A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE GNAWING SENSATION BEGAN TO MAKE ITSELF EVIDENT IT WASN'T EXACTLY PAIN BUT ELLY FELT THAT IT MIGHT EASILY BECOME SO
8382-285236-0035 THE SENSATION INCREASED
8382-285236-0036 SHE BEGAN TO MEDITATE WHETHER HER FAMILY HAD PERHAPS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY PUNISHED I'VE BEEN AWAY A WHOLE DAY SHE REFLECTED AND A WHOLE NIGHT AND I GUESS THEY'VE FELT BADLY ENOUGH
8382-285236-0037 THEY'LL BE SORRY THEY ACTED SO AND ANY WAY I'M SO DREADFULLY HUNGRY THAT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT AND I WANT TO SEE MAMMA TOO PERHAPS SHE'LL HAVE REPENTED AND WILL SAY POOR ELLY SHE MAY GO
8382-285236-0038 IN SHORT ELLY WAS SEIZED WITH A SUDDEN DESIRE FOR HOME AND ALWAYS RAPID IN DECISION SHE LOST NO TIME IN WRIGGLING HERSELF OUT OF THE BUSH THERE IT'S GONE CHIRPED THE FEMALE ROBIN I'M GLAD OF IT I HOPE IT WILL NEVER COME BACK
8382-285236-0039 VERY CAUTIOUSLY ELLY CREPT THROUGH THE SHRUBBERY ON TO THE LAWN
8382-285236-0040 GREAT THUNDER CLOUD WHICH WAS GATHERING OVERHEAD
