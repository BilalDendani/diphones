8245-274393-0000 WHO PRETENDED A RIGHT TO BE CONSULTED AS BEFORE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COMMONWEALTH THEY NOW PRACTISED AGAINST THEIR OFFICERS THE SAME LESSON WHICH THEY HAD BEEN TAUGHT AGAINST THE PARLIAMENT
8245-274393-0001 THEY FRAMED A REMONSTRANCE AND SENT FIVE AGITATORS TO PRESENT IT TO THE GENERAL AND COUNCIL OF WAR
8245-274393-0002 ONE LOCKIER HAVING CARRIED HIS SEDITION FURTHER WAS SENTENCED TO DEATH BUT THIS PUNISHMENT WAS SO FAR FROM QUELLING THE MUTINOUS SPIRIT THAT ABOVE A THOUSAND OF HIS COMPANIONS SHOWED THEIR ADHERENCE TO HIM BY ATTENDING HIS FUNERAL
8245-274393-0003 AND WEARING IN THEIR HATS BLACK AND SEA GREEN RIBBONS BY WAY OF FAVORS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND ASSEMBLED AT BURFORD UNDER THE COMMAND OF THOMSON A MAN FORMERLY CONDEMNED FOR SEDITION BY A COURT MARTIAL BUT PARDONED BY THE GENERAL
8245-274393-0004 COLONEL REYNOLDS AND AFTERWARDS FAIRFAX AND CROMWELL FELL UPON THEM WHILE UNPREPARED FOR DEFENCE AND SEDUCED BY THE APPEARANCE OF A TREATY FOUR HUNDRED WERE TAKEN PRISONERS SOME OF THEM CAPITALLY PUNISHED THE REST PARDONED
8245-274393-0005 AND THIS TUMULTUOUS SPIRIT THOUGH IT STILL LURKED IN THE ARMY AND BROKE OUT FROM TIME TO TIME SEEMED FOR THE PRESENT TO BE SUPPRESSED PETITIONS
8245-274393-0006 WERE PRESENTED TO THE PARLIAMENT BY LIEUTENANT COLONEL LILBURN THE PERSON WHO FOR DISPERSING SEDITIOUS LIBELS HAD FORMERLY BEEN TREATED WITH SUCH SEVERITY BY THE STAR CHAMBER HIS LIBERTY WAS AT THIS TIME AS ILL RELISHED BY THE PARLIAMENT
8245-274393-0007 AND HE WAS THROWN INTO PRISON AS A PROMOTER OF SEDITION AND DISORDER IN THE COMMONWEALTH THE WOMEN APPLIED BY PETITION FOR HIS RELEASE BUT WERE NOW DESIRED TO MIND THEIR HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS AND LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE TO THE MEN
8245-274393-0008 FROM ALL QUARTERS THE PARLIAMENT WAS HARASSED WITH PETITIONS OF A VERY FREE NATURE WHICH STRONGLY SPOKE THE SENSE OF THE NATION AND PROVED HOW ARDENTLY ALL MEN LONGED FOR THE RESTORATION OF THEIR LAWS AND LIBERTIES
8245-274393-0009 EVEN IN A FEAST WHICH THE CITY GAVE TO THE PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL OF STATE IT WAS DEEMED A REQUISITE PRECAUTION IF WE MAY CREDIT WALKER AND DUGDALE
8245-274393-0010 WOULD FIRST BE ATTEMPTED BY CROMWELL AND HE WAS DESIROUS TO EMPLOY THE ENEMY SOME TIME IN THAT SIEGE WHILE HE HIMSELF SHOULD REPAIR HIS BROKEN FORCES BUT CROMWELL KNEW THE IMPORTANCE OF DESPATCH HAVING MADE A BREACH HE ORDERED A GENERAL ASSAULT
8245-274393-0011 AND HIMSELF ALONG WITH IRETON LED ON HIS MEN ALL OPPOSITION WAS OVERBORNE BY THE FURIOUS VALOR OF THE TROOPS THE TOWN WAS TAKEN SWORD IN HAND AND ORDERS BEING ISSUED TO GIVE NO QUARTER A CRUEL SLAUGHTER WAS MADE OF THE GARRISON
8245-274393-0012 EVEN A FEW WHO WERE SAVED BY THE SOLDIERS SATIATED WITH BLOOD WERE NEXT DAY MISERABLY BUTCHERED BY ORDERS FROM THE GENERAL ONE PERSON ALONE OF THE GARRISON ESCAPED TO BE A MESSENGER OF THIS UNIVERSAL HAVOC AND DESTRUCTION
8245-274393-0013 CROMWELL PRETENDED TO RETALIATE BY THIS SEVERE EXECUTION THE CRUELTY OF THE IRISH MASSACRE BUT HE WELL KNEW THAT ALMOST THE WHOLE GARRISON WAS ENGLISH AND HIS JUSTICE WAS ONLY A BARBAROUS POLICY IN ORDER TO TERRIFY ALL OTHER GARRISONS FROM RESISTANCE
8245-274393-0014 HIS POLICY HOWEVER HAD THE DESIRED EFFECT HAVING LED THE ARMY WITHOUT DELAY TO WEXFORD HE BEGAN TO BATTER THE TOWN THE GARRISON AFTER A SLIGHT DEFENCE OFFERED TO CAPITULATE BUT BEFORE THEY OBTAINED A CESSATION THEY IMPRUDENTLY NEGLECTED THEIR GUARDS
8245-274393-0015 THE SAME SEVERITY WAS EXERCISED AS AT TREDAH EVERY TOWN BEFORE WHICH CROMWELL PRESENTED HIMSELF NOW OPENED ITS GATES WITHOUT RESISTANCE ROSS THOUGH STRONGLY GARRISONED WAS SURRENDERED BY LORD TAFFE HAVING TAKEN ESTIONAGE
8245-274393-0016 CROMWELL THREW A BRIDGE OVER THE BARROW AND MADE HIMSELF MASTER OF PASSAGE AND CARRIE THE ENGLISH HAD NO FURTHER DIFFICULTIES TO ENCOUNTER THAN WHAT AROSE FROM FATIGUE
8245-274393-0017 FLUXES AND CONTAGIOUS DISTEMPERS CREPT IN AMONG THE SOLDIERS WHO PERISHED IN GREAT NUMBERS JONES HIMSELF
8245-274393-0018 DIED AT WEXFORD AND CROMWELL HAD SO FAR ADVANCED WITH HIS DECAYED ARMY THAT HE BEGAN TO FIND IT DIFFICULT EITHER TO SUBSIST IN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY
8245-274393-0019 BUT WHILE HE WAS IN THESE STRAITS CORKE KINSALE
8245-274393-0020 THIS DESERTION OF THE ENGLISH PUT AN END TO ORMOND'S AUTHORITY
8245-274393-0021 TREDAH AND WEXFORD THE IRISH ACTUATED BY NATIONAL AND RELIGIOUS PREJUDICES COULD NO LONGER BE KEPT IN OBEDIENCE BY A PROTESTANT GOVERNOR WHO WAS SO UNSUCCESSFUL IN ALL HIS ENTERPRISES THE CLERGY RENEWED THEIR EXCOMMUNICATIONS AGAINST HIM
8245-274393-0022 AND HIS ADHERENTS AND ADDED THE TERRORS OF SUPERSTITION TO THOSE WHICH AROSE FROM A VICTORIOUS ENEMY CROMWELL HAVING RECEIVED A REENFORCEMENT FROM ENGLAND AGAIN TOOK THE FIELD EARLY IN THE SPRING
8245-274393-0023 ORMOND SOON AFTER LEFT THE ISLAND AND DELEGATED HIS AUTHORITY TO CLANRICARDE
8245-274393-0024 ABOVE FORTY THOUSAND MEN PASSED INTO FOREIGN SERVICE AND CROMWELL
8245-274393-0025 WHILE CROMWELL PROCEEDED WITH SUCH UNINTERRUPTED SUCCESS IN IRELAND WHICH IN THE SPACE OF NINE MONTHS HE HAD ALMOST ENTIRELY SUBDUED FORTUNE WAS PREPARING FOR HIM A NEW SCENE OF VICTORY AND TRIUMPH IN SCOTLAND CHARLES WAS AT THE HAGUE
8245-274393-0026 WHEN SIR JOSEPH DOUGLAS BROUGHT HIM INTELLIGENCE THAT HE WAS PROCLAIMED KING BY THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT AT THE SAME TIME
8245-274393-0027 WHICH MIGHT ARISE FROM HIS BEING RECOGNIZED SOVEREIGN IN ONE OF HIS KINGDOMS CHARLES TOO CONSIDERED THAT THOSE WHO PRETENDED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS TITLE WERE AT THAT VERY TIME IN ACTUAL REBELLION AGAINST HIS FAMILY AND WOULD BE SURE TO INTRUST
8245-274393-0028 VERY LITTLE AUTHORITY IN HIS HANDS AND SCARCELY WOULD AFFORD HIM PERSONAL LIBERTY AND SECURITY AS THE PROSPECT OF AFFAIRS IN IRELAND WAS AT THAT TIME NOT UNPROMISING HE INTENDED
8245-274393-0029 RATHER TO TRY HIS FORTUNE IN THAT KINGDOM FROM WHICH HE EXPECTED MORE DUTIFUL SUBMISSION AND OBEDIENCE MEANWHILE HE FOUND IT EXPEDIENT TO DEPART FROM HOLLAND
8245-274393-0030 THE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED PROVINCES WERE MUCH ATTACHED TO HIS INTERESTS BESIDES HIS CONNECTION WITH THE FAMILY OF ORANGE WHICH WAS EXTREMELY BELOVED BY THE POPULACE ALL MEN REGARDED WITH COMPASSION HIS HELPLESS CONDITION
8245-274393-0031 AND EXPRESSED THE GREATEST ABHORRENCE AGAINST THE MURDER OF HIS FATHER A DEED TO WHICH NOTHING THEY THOUGHT BUT THE RAGE OF FANATICISM AND FACTION
8245-274393-0032 BUT THOUGH THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL BORE GREAT FAVOR TO THE KING THE STATES WERE UNEASY AT HIS PRESENCE THEY DREADED THE PARLIAMENT
8245-274393-0033 HE HAD RISEN TO GREAT CREDIT AND FAVOR WITH THE RULING PARTY THEY SENT HIM ENVOY TO HOLLAND BUT NO SOONER HAD HE ARRIVED AT THE HAGUE THAN HE WAS SET UPON BY SOME ROYALISTS CHIEFLY RETAINERS TO MONTROSE
8245-274393-0034 THEY RUSHED INTO THE ROOM WHERE HE WAS SITTING WITH SOME COMPANY DRAGGED HIM FROM THE TABLE PUT HIM TO DEATH AS THE FIRST VICTIM TO THEIR MURDERED SOVEREIGN F VERY LEISURELY AND PEACEABLY SEPARATED THEMSELVES
8245-274393-0035 AND THOUGH ORDERS WERE ISSUED BY THE MAGISTRATES TO ARREST THEM THESE WERE EXECUTED WITH SUCH SLOWNESS AND RELUCTANCE THAT THE CRIMINALS HAD ALL OF THEM THE OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING THEIR ESCAPE
8245-274393-0036 MADE HIS RETREAT INTO JERSEY WHERE HIS AUTHORITY WAS STILL ACKNOWLEDGED HERE WINRAM LAIRD OF LIBERTON
8245-274393-0037 HE GAVE A CIVIL ANSWER TO WINRAM AND DESIRED COMMISSIONERS TO MEET HIM AT BREDA IN ORDER TO ENTER INTO A TREATY WITH REGARD TO THESE CONDITIONS THE EARLS OF CASSILIS AND LOTHIAN LORD BURLEY THE LAIRD OF LIBERTON AND OTHER COMMISSIONERS ARRIVED AT BREDA
8245-274393-0038 BUT WITHOUT ANY POWER OF TREATING THE KING MUST SUBMIT WITHOUT RESERVE TO THE TERMS IMPOSED UPON HIM THE TERMS WERE THAT HE SHOULD ISSUE A PROCLAMATION BANISHING FROM COURT ALL EXCOMMUNICATED PERSONS THAT IS ALL THOSE WHO
8245-274393-0039 EITHER UNDER HAMILTON OR MONTROSE HAD VENTURED THEIR LIVES FOR HIS FAMILY THAT NO ENGLISH SUBJECT WHO HAD SERVED AGAINST THE PARLIAMENT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO APPROACH HIM THAT HE SHOULD BIND HIMSELF BY HIS ROYAL PROMISE TO TAKE THE COVENANT
8245-274393-0040 AND THAT IN CIVIL AFFAIRS HE SHOULD ENTIRELY CONFORM HIMSELF TO THE DIRECTION OF PARLIAMENT AND IN ECCLESIASTICAL TO THAT OF THE ASSEMBLY THESE PROPOSALS THE COMMISSIONERS AFTER PASSING SOME TIME IN SERMONS AND PRAYERS
8245-274393-0041 IN ORDER TO EXPRESS THE MORE DETERMINED RESOLUTION VERY SOLEMNLY DELIVERED TO THE KING THE KING'S FRIENDS WERE DIVIDED WITH REGARD TO THE PART WHICH HE SHOULD ACT IN THIS CRITICAL CONJUNCTURE
8245-274393-0042 MOST OF HIS ENGLISH COUNSELLORS DISSUADED HIM FROM ACCEPTING CONDITIONS SO DISADVANTAGEOUS AND DISHONORABLE THEY SAID
8245-274393-0043 WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING HIS GENTLE GOVERNMENT HAD FIRST EXCITED A REBELLION AGAINST THE LATE KING AFTER THE MOST UNLIMITED CONCESSIONS HAD RENEWED THEIR REBELLION AND STOPPED THE PROGRESS OF HIS VICTORIES IN ENGLAND
8245-274393-0044 HAD BASELY SOLD HIM TOGETHER WITH THEIR OWN HONOR TO HIS BARBAROUS ENEMIES
8245-274393-0045 DISPLAYED THE SAME ANTI MONARCHICAL PRINCIPLES AND THE SAME JEALOUSY OF THEIR SOVEREIGN BY WHICH THEY HAD EVER BEEN ACTUATED THAT NOTHING COULD BE MORE DISHONORABLE THAN THAT THE KING IN HIS FIRST ENTERPRISE SHOULD SACRIFICE MERELY FOR THE EMPTY NAME OF ROYALTY
8245-274393-0046 THOSE PRINCIPLES FOR WHICH HIS FATHER HAD DIED A MARTYR AND IN WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN STRICTLY EDUCATED THAT BY THIS HYPOCRISY
8245-274393-0047 IT HAD SUFFICIENTLY APPEARED BY THE EVENT OF HAMILTON'S ENGAGEMENT
8245-274393-0048 HOW UNEQUAL THEIR FORCE WAS TO SO GREAT AN ENTERPRISE THAT ON THE FIRST CHECK WHICH THEY SHOULD RECEIVE ARGYLE AND HIS PARTISANS WOULD LAY HOLD OF THE QUICKEST EXPEDIENT FOR RECONCILING THEMSELVES TO THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND WOULD BETRAY THE KING
8245-274393-0049 AS THEY HAD DONE HIS FATHER INTO THE HANDS OF HIS ENEMIES AND THAT
8245-274393-0050 THE EARL OF LANERIC NOW DUKE OF HAMILTON
8245-274393-0051 THAT NOTHING WOULD MORE GRATIFY THE KING'S ENEMIES THAN TO SEE HIM FALL INTO THE SNARE LAID FOR HIM AND BY SO SCRUPULOUS A NICETY LEAVE THE POSSESSION OF HIS DOMINIONS TO THOSE WHO DESIRED BUT A PRETENCE FOR EXCLUDING HIM
8245-274393-0052 HAD EMBRACED THIS EXPEDIENT BY WHICH HE HOPED TO MAKE CHARLES DETHRONE HIMSELF AND REFUSE A KINGDOM WHICH WAS OFFERED HIM THAT IT WAS NOT TO BE DOUBTED BUT THE SAME NATIONAL SPIRIT
8245-274393-0053 ASSISTED BY HAMILTON AND HIS PARTY WOULD RISE STILL HIGHER IN FAVOR OF THEIR PRINCE AFTER HE HAD INTRUSTED HIMSELF TO THEIR FIDELITY AND WOULD MUCH ABATE THE RIGOR OF THE CONDITIONS NOW IMPOSED UPON HIM THAT WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE PRESENT INTENTIONS OF THE RULING PARTY
8245-274393-0054 THEY MUST UNAVOIDABLY BE ENGAGED IN A WAR WITH ENGLAND AND MUST ACCEPT THE ASSISTANCE OF THE KING'S FRIENDS OF ALL PARTIES IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES AGAINST A POWER SO MUCH SUPERIOR THAT HOW MUCH SOEVER A STEADY
8245-274393-0055 UNIFORM CONDUCT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUITABLE TO THE ADVANCED AGE AND STRICT ENGAGEMENTS OF THE LATE KING NO ONE WOULD THROW ANY BLAME ON A YOUNG PRINCE FOR COMPLYING WITH CONDITIONS WHICH NECESSITY HAD EXTORTED FROM HIM THAT EVEN THE RIGOR OF THOSE PRINCIPLES PROFESSED BY HIS FATHER
8245-274393-0056 THOUGH WITH SOME IT HAD EXALTED HIS CHARACTER HAD BEEN EXTREMELY PREJUDICIAL TO HIS INTERESTS
8245-274393-0057 THAN TO GIVE ALL PARTIES ROOM TO HOPE FOR MORE EQUAL AND MORE INDULGENT MAXIMS OF GOVERNMENT AND THAT WHERE AFFAIRS WERE REDUCED TO SO DESPERATE A SITUATION DANGERS OUGHT LITTLE TO BE REGARDED
8245-274393-0058 AND THE KING'S HONOR LAY RATHER IN SHOWING SOME EARLY SYMPTOMS OF COURAGE AND ACTIVITY THAN IN CHOOSING STRICTLY A PARTY AMONG THEOLOGICAL CONTROVERSIES WITH WHICH IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED HE WAS AS YET VERY LITTLE ACQUAINTED THESE ARGUMENTS
8245-274393-0059 THE KING'S BROTHER IN LAW WHO BOTH OF THEM THOUGHT IT RIDICULOUS TO REFUSE A KINGDOM MERELY FROM REGARD TO EPISCOPACY HAD GREAT INFLUENCE ON CHARLES BUT WHAT CHIEFLY DETERMINED HIM TO COMPLY WAS THE ACCOUNT BROUGHT HIM OF THE FATE OF MONTROSE WHO
8245-274393-0060 WITH ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF RAGE AND CONTUMELY HAD BEEN PUT TO DEATH BY HIS ZEALOUS COUNTRYMEN THOUGH IN THIS INSTANCE THE KING SAW MORE EVIDENTLY THE FURIOUS SPIRIT BY WHICH THE SCOTS WERE ACTUATED
8245-274393-0061 HAVING LAID DOWN HIS ARMS AT THE COMMAND OF THE LATE KING HAD RETIRED INTO FRANCE
