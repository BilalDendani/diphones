2544-10944-0000 THE SOLE DIFFERENCE LAY IN THE FACT THAT HE WAS MORE BUSILY OCCUPIED THAN EVER
2544-10944-0001 DERANGED BY THE WINTER'S WORK THAT EVERY YEAR GREW HEAVIER AND JUST AS ALWAYS HE RETURNED IN JULY AND AT ONCE FELL TO WORK AS USUAL WITH INCREASED ENERGY AS USUAL TOO HIS WIFE HAD MOVED FOR THE SUMMER TO A VILLA OUT OF TOWN
2544-10944-0002 WHILE HE REMAINED IN PETERSBURG FROM THE DATE OF THEIR CONVERSATION
2544-10944-0003 AND THAT HABITUAL TONE OF HIS BANTERING MIMICRY
2544-10944-0004 HE WAS A LITTLE COLDER TO HIS WIFE HE SIMPLY SEEMED TO BE SLIGHTLY DISPLEASED WITH HER FOR THAT FIRST MIDNIGHT CONVERSATION WHICH SHE HAD REPELLED IN HIS ATTITUDE TO HER THERE WAS A SHADE OF VEXATION BUT NOTHING MORE
2544-10944-0005 SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR YOU NOW YOU MAY BEG AS YOU PLEASE BUT I WON'T BE OPEN WITH YOU SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR YOU HE SAID MENTALLY LIKE A MAN WHO AFTER VAINLY ATTEMPTING TO EXTINGUISH A FIRE SHOULD FLY IN A RAGE WITH HIS VAIN EFFORTS AND SAY
2544-10944-0006 HE DID NOT REALIZE IT BECAUSE IT WAS TOO TERRIBLE TO HIM TO REALIZE HIS ACTUAL POSITION
2544-10944-0007 THAT IS HIS WIFE AND SON HE WHO HAD BEEN SUCH A CAREFUL FATHER HAD FROM THE END OF THAT WINTER BECOME PECULIARLY FRIGID TO HIS SON AND ADOPTED TO HIM JUST THE SAME BANTERING TONE HE USED WITH HIS WIFE
2544-10944-0008 ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH
2544-10944-0009 AND HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT THEM WHICH BECAME MORE TERRIBLE THE LONGER THEY LAY THERE
2544-10944-0010 THE MILD AND PEACEABLE ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH WOULD HAVE MADE NO ANSWER BUT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATLY ANGERED WITH ANY MAN WHO SHOULD QUESTION HIM ON THAT SUBJECT FOR THIS REASON THERE POSITIVELY CAME INTO ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH'S FACE
2544-10944-0011 A LOOK OF HAUGHTINESS AND SEVERITY WHENEVER ANYONE INQUIRED AFTER HIS WIFE'S HEALTH ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH DID NOT WANT TO THINK AT ALL ABOUT HIS WIFE'S BEHAVIOR AND HE ACTUALLY SUCCEEDED IN NOT THINKING ABOUT IT AT ALL
2544-10944-0012 AND CONSTANTLY SEEING HER THAT YEAR COUNTESS LIDIA IVANOVNA DECLINED TO SETTLE IN PETERHOF
2544-10944-0013 AND IN CONVERSATION WITH ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH HINTED AT THE UNSUITABILITY OF ANNA'S CLOSE INTIMACY WITH BETSY AND VRONSKY ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH STERNLY CUT HER SHORT
2544-10944-0014 ROUNDLY DECLARING HIS WIFE TO BE ABOVE SUSPICION AND FROM THAT TIME BEGAN TO AVOID COUNTESS LIDIA
2544-10944-0015 HE DID NOT WANT TO SEE AND DID NOT SEE THAT MANY PEOPLE IN SOCIETY CAST DUBIOUS GLANCES ON HIS WIFE HE DID NOT WANT TO UNDERSTAND AND DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY HIS WIFE HAD SO PARTICULARLY INSISTED ON STAYING AT TSARSKOE
2544-10944-0016 WHERE BETSY WAS STAYING AND NOT FAR FROM THE CAMP OF VRONSKY'S REGIMENT HE DID NOT ALLOW HIMSELF TO THINK ABOUT IT AND HE DID NOT THINK ABOUT IT
2544-10944-0017 BUT ALL THE SAME THOUGH HE NEVER ADMITTED IT TO HIMSELF AND HAD NO PROOFS NOT EVEN SUSPICIOUS EVIDENCE IN THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART HE KNEW BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT HE WAS A DECEIVED HUSBAND AND HE WAS PROFOUNDLY MISERABLE ABOUT IT
2544-10944-0018 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM ABROAD ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH HAD TWICE BEEN AT THEIR COUNTRY VILLA ONCE HE DINED THERE ANOTHER TIME HE SPENT THE EVENING THERE WITH A PARTY OF FRIENDS
2544-10944-0019 BUT HE HAD NOT ONCE STAYED THE NIGHT THERE AS IT HAD BEEN HIS HABIT TO DO IN PREVIOUS YEARS
2544-10944-0020 BUT WHEN MENTALLY SKETCHING OUT THE DAY IN THE MORNING HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO TO THEIR COUNTRY HOUSE TO SEE HIS WIFE IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER AND FROM THERE TO THE RACES
2544-10944-0021 HE WAS GOING TO SEE HIS WIFE BECAUSE HE HAD DETERMINED TO SEE HER ONCE A WEEK TO KEEP UP APPEARANCES AND BESIDES ON THAT DAY AS IT WAS THE FIFTEENTH HE HAD TO GIVE HIS WIFE SOME MONEY FOR HER EXPENSES ACCORDING TO THEIR USUAL ARRANGEMENT
2544-10944-0022 WITH HIS HABITUAL CONTROL OVER HIS THOUGHTS THOUGH HE THOUGHT ALL THIS ABOUT HIS WIFE HE DID NOT LET HIS THOUGHTS STRAY FURTHER IN REGARD TO HER
2544-10944-0023 THE EVENING BEFORE COUNTESS LIDIA IVANOVNA HAD SENT HIM A PAMPHLET BY A CELEBRATED TRAVELER IN CHINA WHO WAS STAYING IN PETERSBURG AND WITH IT SHE ENCLOSED A NOTE BEGGING HIM TO SEE THE TRAVELER HIMSELF
2544-10944-0024 AS HE WAS AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING PERSON FROM VARIOUS POINTS OF VIEW AND LIKELY TO BE USEFUL
2544-10944-0025 AND FINISHED IT IN THE MORNING THEN PEOPLE BEGAN ARRIVING WITH PETITIONS AND THERE CAME THE REPORTS INTERVIEWS APPOINTMENTS DISMISSALS APPORTIONMENT OF REWARDS PENSIONS GRANTS NOTES THE WORKADAY ROUND
2544-10944-0026 AS ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH CALLED IT THAT ALWAYS TOOK UP SO MUCH TIME THEN THERE WAS PRIVATE BUSINESS OF HIS OWN A VISIT FROM THE DOCTOR AND THE STEWARD WHO MANAGED HIS PROPERTY
2544-10944-0027 THE STEWARD DID NOT TAKE UP MUCH TIME HE SIMPLY GAVE ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH THE MONEY HE NEEDED
2544-10944-0028 WHICH WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SATISFACTORY AS IT HAD HAPPENED THAT DURING THAT YEAR OWING TO INCREASED EXPENSES MORE HAD BEEN PAID OUT THAN USUAL AND THERE WAS A DEFICIT
2544-10944-0029 BUT THE DOCTOR A CELEBRATED PETERSBURG DOCTOR WHO WAS AN INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE OF ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH TOOK UP A GREAT DEAL OF TIME ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH HAD NOT EXPECTED HIM THAT DAY
2544-10944-0030 AND WAS SURPRISED AT HIS VISIT AND STILL MORE SO WHEN THE DOCTOR QUESTIONED HIM VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT HIS HEALTH LISTENED TO HIS BREATHING AND TAPPED AT HIS LIVER ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH DID NOT KNOW THAT HIS FRIEND LIDIA IVANOVNA
2544-10944-0031 I WILL DO IT FOR THE SAKE OF RUSSIA COUNTESS REPLIED THE DOCTOR A PRICELESS MAN SAID THE COUNTESS LIDIA IVANOVNA THE DOCTOR WAS EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED WITH ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH
2544-10944-0032 HE FOUND THE LIVER CONSIDERABLY ENLARGED AND THE DIGESTIVE POWERS WEAKENED WHILE THE COURSE OF MINERAL WATERS HAD BEEN QUITE WITHOUT EFFECT HE PRESCRIBED MORE PHYSICAL EXERCISE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
2544-10944-0033 AND AS FAR AS POSSIBLE LESS MENTAL STRAIN AND ABOVE ALL NO WORRY IN OTHER WORDS JUST WHAT WAS AS MUCH OUT OF ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH'S POWER AS ABSTAINING FROM BREATHING THEN HE WITHDREW
2544-10944-0034 LEAVING IN ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH AN UNPLEASANT SENSE THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH HIM AND THAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF CURING IT AS HE WAS COMING AWAY THE DOCTOR CHANCED TO MEET ON THE STAIRCASE AN ACQUAINTANCE OF HIS SLUDIN
2544-10944-0035 THEY HAD BEEN COMRADES AT THE UNIVERSITY AND THOUGH THEY RARELY MET THEY THOUGHT HIGHLY OF EACH OTHER AND WERE EXCELLENT FRIENDS AND SO THERE WAS NO ONE TO WHOM THE DOCTOR WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIS OPINION OF A PATIENT SO FREELY AS TO SLUDIN
2544-10944-0036 WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM I'LL TELL YOU SAID THE DOCTOR BECKONING OVER SLUDIN'S HEAD TO HIS COACHMAN TO BRING THE CARRIAGE ROUND IT'S JUST THIS SAID THE DOCTOR TAKING A FINGER OF HIS KID GLOVE IN HIS WHITE HANDS AND PULLING IT
2544-10944-0037 IF YOU DON'T STRAIN THE STRINGS AND THEN TRY TO BREAK THEM YOU'LL FIND IT A DIFFICULT JOB BUT STRAIN A STRING TO ITS VERY UTMOST AND THE MERE WEIGHT OF ONE FINGER ON THE STRAINED STRING WILL SNAP IT
2544-10944-0038 HE'S STRAINED TO THE UTMOST AND THERE'S SOME OUTSIDE BURDEN WEIGHING ON HIM AND NOT A LIGHT ONE CONCLUDED THE DOCTOR RAISING HIS EYEBROWS SIGNIFICANTLY
2544-10944-0039 YES YES TO BE SURE IT DOES WASTE A LOT OF TIME THE DOCTOR RESPONDED VAGUELY TO SOME REPLY OF SLUDIN'S HE HAD NOT CAUGHT DIRECTLY AFTER THE DOCTOR WHO HAD TAKEN UP SO MUCH TIME CAME THE CELEBRATED TRAVELER
2544-10944-0040 AND ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH BY MEANS OF THE PAMPHLET HE HAD ONLY JUST FINISHED READING AND HIS PREVIOUS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SUBJECT IMPRESSED THE TRAVELER BY THE DEPTH OF HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECT AND THE BREADTH AND ENLIGHTENMENT OF HIS VIEW OF IT
2544-10944-0041 AT THE SAME TIME AS THE TRAVELER THERE WAS ANNOUNCED A PROVINCIAL MARSHAL OF NOBILITY ON A VISIT TO PETERSBURG WITH WHOM ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH HAD TO HAVE SOME CONVERSATION
2544-10944-0042 AFTER HIS DEPARTURE HE HAD TO FINISH THE DAILY ROUTINE OF BUSINESS WITH HIS SECRETARY AND THEN HE STILL HAD TO DRIVE ROUND TO CALL ON A CERTAIN GREAT PERSONAGE ON A MATTER OF GRAVE AND SERIOUS IMPORT
2544-10944-0043 AND AFTER DINING WITH HIS SECRETARY HE INVITED HIM TO DRIVE WITH HIM TO HIS COUNTRY VILLA AND TO THE RACES THOUGH HE DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE IT TO HIMSELF ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH ALWAYS TRIED NOWADAYS TO SECURE THE PRESENCE OF A THIRD PERSON
