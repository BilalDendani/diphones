4189-274546-0000 WHAT O'CLOCK IS IT OLD SAYING EVERYBODY KNOWS IN A GENERAL WAY THAT THE FINEST PLACE IN THE WORLD IS OR ALAS WAS THE DUTCH BOROUGH OF VONDERVOTTEIMITTISS YET
4189-274546-0001 THERE ARE PERHAPS VERY FEW OF MY READERS WHO HAVE EVER PAID IT A VISIT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO HAVE NOT THEREFORE IT WILL BE ONLY PROPER THAT I SHOULD ENTER INTO SOME ACCOUNT OF IT
4189-274546-0002 I DESIGN HERE TO GIVE A HISTORY OF THE CALAMITOUS EVENTS WHICH HAVE SO LATELY OCCURRED WITHIN ITS LIMITS NO ONE WHO KNOWS ME WILL DOUBT THAT THE DUTY THUS SELF IMPOSED WILL BE EXECUTED TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY WITH ALL THAT RIGID IMPARTIALITY ALL THAT CAUTIOUS EXAMINATION INTO FACTS
4189-274546-0003 AND DILIGENT COLLATION OF AUTHORITIES WHICH SHOULD EVER DISTINGUISH HIM WHO ASPIRES TO THE TITLE OF HISTORIAN BY THE UNITED AID OF MEDALS MANUSCRIPTS AND INSCRIPTIONS I AM ENABLED TO SAY POSITIVELY
4189-274546-0004 THAT THE BOROUGH OF VONDERVOTTEIMITTISS HAS EXISTED FROM ITS ORIGIN IN PRECISELY THE SAME CONDITION WHICH IT AT PRESENT PRESERVES OF THE DATE OF THIS ORIGIN HOWEVER I GRIEVE THAT I CAN ONLY SPEAK WITH THAT SPECIES OF INDEFINITE DEFINITENESS
4189-274546-0005 WHICH MATHEMATICIANS ARE AT TIMES FORCED TO PUT UP WITH IN CERTAIN ALGEBRAIC FORMULAE THE DATE I MAY THUS SAY IN REGARD TO THE REMOTENESS OF ITS ANTIQUITY CANNOT BE LESS THAN ANY ASSIGNABLE QUANTITY WHATSOEVER
4189-274546-0006 TOUCHING THE DERIVATION OF THE NAME VONDERVOTTEIMITTISS I CONFESS MYSELF WITH SORROW EQUALLY AT FAULT AMONG A MULTITUDE OF OPINIONS UPON THIS DELICATE POINT SOME ACUTE SOME LEARNED SOME SUFFICIENTLY THE REVERSE
4189-274546-0007 I AM ABLE TO SELECT NOTHING WHICH OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED SATISFACTORY PERHAPS THE IDEA OF GROGSWIGG NEARLY COINCIDENT WITH THAT OF KROUTAPLENTTEY IS TO BE CAUTIOUSLY PREFERRED IT RUNS
4189-274546-0008 VOTTEIMITTIS QUASI UND BLEITZIZ BLEITZIZ OBSOL PRO BLITZEN THIS DERIVATIVE TO SAY THE TRUTH IS STILL COUNTENANCED BY SOME TRACES OF THE ELECTRIC FLUID EVIDENT ON THE SUMMIT OF THE STEEPLE OF THE HOUSE OF THE TOWN COUNCIL
4189-274546-0009 I DO NOT CHOOSE HOWEVER TO COMMIT MYSELF ON A THEME OF SUCH IMPORTANCE AND MUST REFER THE READER DESIROUS OF INFORMATION
4189-274546-0010 OF DUNDERGUTZ SEE ALSO BLUNDERBUZZARD DE DERIVATIONIBUS
4189-274546-0011 WHEREIN CONSULT ALSO MARGINAL NOTES IN THE AUTOGRAPH OF STUFFUNDPUFF
4189-274546-0012 THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS I SAID BEFORE THAT IT HAS ALWAYS EXISTED AS WE FIND IT AT THIS EPOCH THE OLDEST MAN IN THE BOROUGH CAN REMEMBER NOT THE SLIGHTEST DIFFERENCE IN THE APPEARANCE OF ANY PORTION OF IT AND INDEED THE VERY SUGGESTION OF SUCH A POSSIBILITY IS CONSIDERED AN INSULT
4189-274546-0013 THE SITE OF THE VILLAGE IS IN A PERFECTLY CIRCULAR VALLEY ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE IN CIRCUMFERENCE AND ENTIRELY SURROUNDED BY GENTLE HILLS OVER WHOSE SUMMIT THE PEOPLE HAVE NEVER YET VENTURED TO PASS FOR THIS THEY ASSIGN THE VERY GOOD REASON
4189-274546-0014 THAT THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANYTHING AT ALL ON THE OTHER SIDE ROUND THE SKIRTS OF THE VALLEY WHICH IS QUITE LEVEL AND PAVED THROUGHOUT WITH FLAT TILES EXTENDS A CONTINUOUS ROW OF SIXTY LITTLE HOUSES THESE HAVING THEIR BACKS ON THE HILLS MUST LOOK OF COURSE TO THE CENTRE OF THE PLAIN
4189-274546-0015 WHICH IS JUST SIXTY YARDS FROM THE FRONT DOOR OF EACH DWELLING EVERY HOUSE HAS A SMALL GARDEN BEFORE IT WITH A CIRCULAR PATH A SUN DIAL AND TWENTY FOUR CABBAGES THE BUILDINGS THEMSELVES ARE SO PRECISELY ALIKE THAT ONE CAN IN NO MANNER BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE OTHER
4189-274546-0016 OWING TO THE VAST ANTIQUITY THE STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE IS SOMEWHAT ODD BUT IT IS NOT FOR THAT REASON THE LESS STRIKINGLY PICTURESQUE THEY ARE FASHIONED OF HARD BURNED LITTLE BRICKS RED WITH BLACK ENDS SO THAT THE WALLS LOOK LIKE A CHESS BOARD UPON A GREAT SCALE
4189-274546-0017 THE GABLES ARE TURNED TO THE FRONT AND THERE ARE CORNICES AS BIG AS ALL THE REST OF THE HOUSE OVER THE EAVES AND OVER THE MAIN DOORS THE WINDOWS ARE NARROW AND DEEP WITH VERY TINY PANES AND A GREAT DEAL OF SASH
4189-274546-0018 ON THE ROOF IS A VAST QUANTITY OF TILES WITH LONG CURLY EARS THE WOODWORK THROUGHOUT IS OF A DARK HUE AND THERE IS MUCH CARVING ABOUT IT
4189-274546-0019 THE CARVERS OF VONDERVOTTEIMITTISS HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CARVE MORE THAN TWO OBJECTS A TIME PIECE AND A CABBAGE BUT THESE THEY DO EXCEEDINGLY WELL AND INTERSPERSE THEM WITH SINGULAR INGENUITY WHEREVER THEY FIND ROOM FOR THE CHISEL
4189-274546-0020 THE DWELLINGS ARE AS MUCH ALIKE INSIDE AS OUT AND THE FURNITURE IS ALL UPON ONE PLAN THE FLOORS ARE OF SQUARE TILES THE CHAIRS AND TABLES OF BLACK LOOKING WOOD WITH THIN CROOKED LEGS AND PUPPY FEET THE MANTELPIECES ARE WIDE AND HIGH
4189-274546-0021 AND HAVE NOT ONLY TIME PIECES AND CABBAGES SCULPTURED OVER THE FRONT BUT A REAL TIME PIECE WHICH MAKES A PRODIGIOUS TICKING ON THE TOP IN THE MIDDLE
4189-274546-0022 BETWEEN EACH CABBAGE AND THE TIME PIECE AGAIN IS A LITTLE CHINA MAN HAVING A LARGE STOMACH WITH A GREAT ROUND HOLE IN IT THROUGH WHICH IS SEEN THE DIAL PLATE OF A WATCH THE FIREPLACES ARE LARGE AND DEEP WITH FIERCE CROOKED LOOKING FIRE DOGS
4189-274546-0023 THERE IS CONSTANTLY A ROUSING FIRE AND A HUGE POT OVER IT FULL OF SAUER KRAUT AND PORK TO WHICH THE GOOD WOMAN OF THE HOUSE IS ALWAYS BUSY IN ATTENDING SHE IS A LITTLE FAT OLD LADY WITH BLUE EYES AND A RED FACE AND WEARS A HUGE CAP LIKE A SUGAR LOAF
4189-274546-0024 ORNAMENTED WITH PURPLE AND YELLOW RIBBONS HER DRESS IS OF ORANGE COLORED LINSEY WOOLSEY MADE VERY FULL BEHIND AND VERY SHORT IN THE WAIST AND INDEED VERY SHORT IN OTHER RESPECTS NOT REACHING BELOW THE MIDDLE OF HER LEG THIS IS SOMEWHAT THICK AND SO ARE HER ANKLES
4189-274546-0025 BUT SHE HAS A FINE PAIR OF GREEN STOCKINGS TO COVER THEM HER SHOES OF PINK LEATHER ARE FASTENED EACH WITH A BUNCH OF YELLOW RIBBONS PUCKERED UP IN THE SHAPE OF A CABBAGE IN HER LEFT HAND SHE HAS A LITTLE HEAVY DUTCH WATCH IN HER RIGHT SHE WIELDS A LADLE FOR THE SAUERKRAUT AND PORK
4189-274546-0026 BY HER SIDE THERE STANDS A FAT TABBY CAT WITH A GILT TOY REPEATER TIED TO ITS TAIL WHICH THE BOYS HAVE THERE FASTENED BY WAY OF A QUIZ THE BOYS THEMSELVES ARE ALL THREE OF THEM IN THE GARDEN ATTENDING THE PIG THEY ARE EACH TWO FEET IN HEIGHT
4189-274546-0027 THEY HAVE THREE CORNERED COCKED HATS PURPLE WAISTCOATS REACHING DOWN TO THEIR THIGHS BUCKSKIN KNEE BREECHES RED STOCKINGS HEAVY SHOES WITH BIG SILVER BUCKLES LONG SURTOUT COATS WITH LARGE BUTTONS OF MOTHER OF PEARL EACH TOO HAS A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH
4189-274546-0028 AND A LITTLE DUMPY WATCH IN HIS RIGHT HAND HE TAKES A PUFF AND A LOOK AND THEN A LOOK AND A PUFF THE PIG WHICH IS CORPULENT AND LAZY IS OCCUPIED NOW IN PICKING UP THE STRAY LEAVES THAT FALL FROM THE CABBAGES AND NOW IN GIVING A KICK BEHIND AT THE GILT REPEATER
4189-274546-0029 RIGHT AT THE FRONT DOOR IN A HIGH BACKED LEATHER BOTTOMED ARMED CHAIR WITH CROOKED LEGS AND PUPPY FEET LIKE THE TABLES IS SEATED THE OLD MAN OF THE HOUSE HIMSELF HE IS AN EXCEEDINGLY PUFFY LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH BIG CIRCULAR EYES AND A HUGE DOUBLE CHIN
4189-274546-0030 HIS DRESS RESEMBLES THAT OF THE BOYS AND I NEED SAY NOTHING FARTHER ABOUT IT ALL THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT HIS PIPE IS SOMEWHAT BIGGER THAN THEIRS AND HE CAN MAKE A GREATER SMOKE LIKE THEM HE HAS A WATCH BUT HE CARRIES HIS WATCH IN HIS POCKET
4189-274546-0031 TO SAY THE TRUTH HE HAS SOMETHING OF MORE IMPORTANCE THAN A WATCH TO ATTEND TO AND WHAT THAT IS I SHALL PRESENTLY EXPLAIN
4189-274546-0032 HE SITS WITH HIS RIGHT LEG UPON HIS LEFT KNEE WEARS A GRAVE COUNTENANCE AND ALWAYS KEEPS ONE OF HIS EYES AT LEAST RESOLUTELY BENT UPON A CERTAIN REMARKABLE OBJECT IN THE CENTRE OF THE PLAIN THIS OBJECT IS SITUATED IN THE STEEPLE OF THE HOUSE OF THE TOWN COUNCIL
4189-274546-0033 THE TOWN COUNCIL ARE ALL VERY LITTLE ROUND OILY INTELLIGENT MEN WITH BIG SAUCER EYES AND FAT DOUBLE CHINS AND HAVE THEIR COATS MUCH LONGER AND THEIR SHOE BUCKLES MUCH BIGGER THAN THE ORDINARY INHABITANTS OF VONDERVOTTEIMITTISS SINCE MY SOJOURN IN THE BOROUGH
4189-274546-0034 THEY HAVE HAD SEVERAL SPECIAL MEETINGS AND HAVE ADOPTED THESE THREE IMPORTANT RESOLUTIONS THAT IT IS WRONG TO ALTER THE GOOD OLD COURSE OF THINGS THAT THERE IS NOTHING TOLERABLE OUT OF VONDERVOTTEIMITTISS AND THAT WE WILL STICK BY OUR CLOCKS AND OUR CABBAGES
4189-274546-0035 ABOVE THE SESSION ROOM OF THE COUNCIL IS THE STEEPLE AND IN THE STEEPLE IS THE BELFRY WHERE EXISTS AND HAS EXISTED TIME OUT OF MIND THE PRIDE AND WONDER OF THE VILLAGE THE GREAT CLOCK OF THE BOROUGH OF VONDERVOTTEIMITTISS
4189-274546-0036 THE GREAT CLOCK HAS SEVEN FACES
4189-274546-0037 ITS FACES ARE LARGE AND WHITE AND ITS HANDS HEAVY AND BLACK THERE IS A BELFRY MAN WHOSE SOLE DUTY IS TO ATTEND TO IT BUT THIS DUTY IS THE MOST PERFECT OF SINECURES FOR THE CLOCK OF VONDERVOTTEIMITTIS WAS NEVER YET KNOWN TO HAVE ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH IT
4189-274546-0038 UNTIL LATELY THE BARE SUPPOSITION OF SUCH A THING WAS CONSIDERED HERETICAL FROM THE REMOTEST PERIOD OF ANTIQUITY TO WHICH THE ARCHIVES HAVE REFERENCE THE HOURS HAVE BEEN REGULARLY STRUCK BY THE BIG BELL
4189-274546-0039 AND INDEED THE CASE WAS JUST THE SAME WITH ALL THE OTHER CLOCKS AND WATCHES IN THE BOROUGH NEVER WAS SUCH A PLACE FOR KEEPING THE TRUE TIME WHEN THE LARGE CLAPPER THOUGHT PROPER TO SAY TWELVE O'CLOCK ALL ITS OBEDIENT FOLLOWERS OPENED THEIR THROATS SIMULTANEOUSLY
4189-274546-0040 AND RESPONDED LIKE A VERY ECHO IN SHORT THE GOOD BURGHERS WERE FOND OF THEIR SAUER KRAUT BUT THEN THEY WERE PROUD OF THEIR CLOCKS ALL PEOPLE WHO HOLD SINECURE OFFICES ARE HELD IN MORE OR LESS RESPECT
4189-274546-0041 AND AS THE BELFRY MAN OF VONDERVOTTEIMITTISS HAS THE MOST PERFECT OF SINECURES HE IS THE MOST PERFECTLY RESPECTED OF ANY MAN IN THE WORLD HE IS THE CHIEF DIGNITARY OF THE BOROUGH AND THE VERY PIGS LOOK UP TO HIM WITH A SENTIMENT OF REVERENCE HIS COAT TAIL IS VERY FAR LONGER
4189-274546-0042 HIS PIPE HIS SHOE BUCKLES HIS EYES AND HIS STOMACH VERY FAR BIGGER THAN THOSE OF ANY OTHER OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE VILLAGE AND AS TO HIS CHIN IT IS NOT ONLY DOUBLE BUT TRIPLE I HAVE THUS PAINTED THE HAPPY ESTATE OF VONDERVOTTEIMITTISS
4189-274546-0043 ALAS THAT SO FAIR A PICTURE SHOULD EVER EXPERIENCE A REVERSE THERE HAS BEEN LONG A SAYING AMONG THE WISEST INHABITANTS THAT NO GOOD CAN COME FROM OVER THE HILLS AND IT REALLY SEEMED THAT THE WORDS HAD IN THEM SOMETHING OF THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY
4189-274546-0044 IT WANTED FIVE MINUTES OF NOON ON THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY WHEN THERE APPEARED A VERY ODD LOOKING OBJECT ON THE SUMMIT OF THE RIDGE OF THE EASTWARD SUCH AN OCCURRENCE OF COURSE ATTRACTED UNIVERSAL ATTENTION AND EVERY LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN WHO SAT IN A LEATHER BOTTOMED ARM CHAIR
4189-274546-0045 TURNED ONE OF HIS EYES WITH A STARE OF DISMAY UPON THE PHENOMENON STILL KEEPING THE OTHER UPON THE CLOCK IN THE STEEPLE BY THE TIME THAT IT WANTED ONLY THREE MINUTES TO NOON THE DROLL OBJECT IN QUESTION WAS PERCEIVED TO BE A VERY DIMINUTIVE FOREIGN LOOKING YOUNG MAN
4189-274546-0046 HE DESCENDED THE HILLS AT A GREAT RATE SO THAT EVERY BODY HAD SOON A GOOD LOOK AT HIM HE WAS REALLY THE MOST FINICKY LITTLE PERSONAGE THAT HAD EVER BEEN SEEN IN VONDERVOTTEIMITTISS HIS COUNTENANCE WAS OF A DARK SNUFF COLOR
4189-274546-0047 AND HE HAD A LONG HOOKED NOSE PEA EYES A WIDE MOUTH AND AN EXCELLENT SET OF TEETH WHICH LATTER HE SEEMED ANXIOUS OF DISPLAYING AS HE WAS GRINNING FROM EAR TO EAR WHAT WITH MUSTACHIOS AND WHISKERS THERE WAS NONE OF THE REST OF HIS FACE TO BE SEEN HIS HEAD WAS UNCOVERED
4189-274546-0048 AND HIS HAIR NEATLY DONE UP IN PAPILLOTES HIS DRESS WAS A TIGHT FITTING SWALLOW TAILED BLACK COAT FROM ONE OF WHOSE POCKETS DANGLED A VAST LENGTH OF WHITE HANDKERCHIEF
4189-274546-0049 BLACK STOCKINGS AND STUMPY LOOKING PUMPS WITH HUGE BUNCHES OF BLACK SATIN RIBBON FOR BOWS UNDER ONE ARM HE CARRIED A HUGE CHAPEAU DE BRAS AND UNDER THE OTHER A FIDDLE NEARLY FIVE TIMES AS BIG AS HIMSELF IN HIS LEFT HAND WAS A GOLD SNUFF BOX FROM WHICH AS HE CAPERED DOWN THE HILL
4189-274546-0050 CUTTING ALL MANNER OF FANTASTIC STEPS HE TOOK SNUFF INCESSANTLY WITH AN AIR OF THE GREATEST POSSIBLE SELF SATISFACTION GOD BLESS ME HERE WAS A SIGHT FOR THE HONEST BURGHERS OF VONDERVOTTEIMITTISS TO SPEAK PLAINLY
4189-274546-0051 THE FELLOW HAD IN SPITE OF HIS GRINNING AN AUDACIOUS AND SINISTER KIND OF FACE
4189-274546-0052 AND MANY A BURGHER WHO BEHELD HIM THAT DAY WOULD HAVE GIVEN A TRIFLE FOR A PEEP BENEATH THE WHITE CAMBRIC HANDKERCHIEF WHICH HUNG SO OBTRUSIVELY FROM THE POCKET OF HIS SWALLOW TAILED COAT BUT WHAT MAINLY OCCASIONED A RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION WAS THAT THE SCOUNDRELLY POPINJAY
4189-274546-0053 DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE THE REMOTEST IDEA IN THE WORLD OF SUCH A THING AS KEEPING TIME IN HIS STEPS THE GOOD PEOPLE OF THE BOROUGH HAD SCARCELY A CHANCE HOWEVER TO GET THEIR EYES THOROUGHLY OPEN WHEN JUST AS IT WANTED HALF A MINUTE OF NOON
4189-274546-0054 THE RASCAL BOUNCED AS I SAY RIGHT INTO THE MIDST OF THEM GAVE A CHASSEZ HERE AND A BALANCEZ THERE
4189-274546-0055 PIGEON WINGED HIMSELF RIGHT UP INTO THE BELFRY OF THE HOUSE OF THE TOWN COUNCIL WHERE THE WONDER STRICKEN BELFRY MAN SAT SMOKING IN A STATE OF DIGNITY AND DISMAY BUT THE LITTLE CHAP SEIZED HIM AT ONCE BY THE NOSE GAVE IT A SWING AND A PULL CLAPPED THE BIG CHAPEAU DE BRAS UPON HIS HEAD
4189-274546-0056 KNOCKED IT DOWN OVER HIS EYES AND MOUTH AND THEN LIFTING UP THE BIG FIDDLE BEAT HIM WITH IT SO LONG AND SO SOUNDLY THAT WHAT WITH THE BELFRY MAN BEING SO FAT AND THE FIDDLE BEING SO HOLLOW
4189-274546-0057 YOU WOULD HAVE SWORN THAT THERE WAS A REGIMENT OF DOUBLE BASS DRUMMERS ALL BEATING THE DEVIL'S TATTOO UP IN THE BELFRY OF THE STEEPLE OF VONDERVOTTEIMITTISS THERE IS NO KNOWING TO WHAT DESPERATE ACT OF VENGEANCE THIS UNPRINCIPLED ATTACK MIGHT HAVE AROUSED THE INHABITANTS
4189-274546-0058 BUT FOR THE IMPORTANT FACT THAT IT NOW WANTED ONLY HALF A SECOND OF NOON THE BELL WAS ABOUT TO STRIKE AND IT WAS A MATTER OF ABSOLUTE AND PRE EMINENT NECESSITY THAT EVERY BODY SHOULD LOOK WELL AT HIS WATCH
4189-274546-0059 IT WAS EVIDENT HOWEVER THAT JUST AT THIS MOMENT THE FELLOW IN THE STEEPLE WAS DOING SOMETHING THAT HE HAD NO BUSINESS TO DO WITH THE CLOCK BUT AS IT NOW BEGAN TO STRIKE
4189-274546-0060 FOR THEY HAD ALL TO COUNT THE STROKES OF THE BELL AS IT SOUNDED
4189-274546-0061 VON ECHOED EVERY LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN IN EVERY LEATHER BOTTOMED ARM CHAIR IN VONDERVOTTEIMITTISS VON SAID HIS WATCH ALSO VON SAID THE WATCH OF HIS VROW AND VON SAID THE WATCHES OF THE BOYS AND THE LITTLE GILT REPEATERS ON THE TAILS OF THE CAT AND PIG
4189-274546-0062 THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN SAID THE BELL DREE VOUR FIBE
4189-274546-0063 ELEVEN SAID THE BIG ONE ELEBEN ASSENTED THE LITTLE ONES TWELVE SAID THE BELL DVELF THEY REPLIED PERFECTLY SATISFIED AND DROPPING THEIR VOICES UND DVELF IT IS SAID ALL THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMEN PUTTING UP THEIR WATCHES
4189-274546-0064 BUT THE BIG BELL HAD NOT DONE WITH THEM YET THIRTEEN SAID HE DER TEUFEL GASPED THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMEN TURNING PALE DROPPING THEIR PIPES AND PUTTING DOWN ALL THEIR RIGHT LEGS FROM OVER THEIR LEFT KNEES DER TEUFEL
4189-274546-0065 MEIN GOTT IT IS DIRTEEN O'CLOCK WHY ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE THE TERRIBLE SCENE WHICH ENSUED ALL VONDERVOTTEIMITTISS FLEW AT ONCE INTO A LAMENTABLE STATE OF UPROAR VOT IS CUM'D TO MEIN PELLY ROARED ALL THE BOYS I'VE BEEN ONGRY FOR DIS HOUR
4189-274546-0066 DONDER AND BLITZEN IT HAS BEEN SMOKED OUT FOR DIS HOUR AND THEY FILLED THEM UP AGAIN IN A GREAT RAGE
4189-274546-0067 THAT THE WHOLE VALLEY WAS IMMEDIATELY FILLED WITH IMPENETRABLE SMOKE MEANTIME THE CABBAGES ALL TURNED VERY RED IN THE FACE AND IT SEEMED AS IF OLD NICK HIMSELF HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF EVERY THING IN THE SHAPE OF A TIMEPIECE
4189-274546-0068 THE CLOCKS CARVED UPON THE FURNITURE TOOK TO DANCING AS IF BEWITCHED WHILE THOSE UPON THE MANTEL PIECES COULD SCARCELY CONTAIN THEMSELVES FOR FURY AND KEPT SUCH A CONTINUAL STRIKING OF THIRTEEN
4189-274546-0069 BUT WORSE THAN ALL NEITHER THE CATS NOR THE PIGS COULD PUT UP ANY LONGER WITH THE BEHAVIOR OF THE LITTLE REPEATERS TIED TO THEIR TAILS AND RESENTED IT BY SCAMPERING ALL OVER THE PLACE SCRATCHING AND POKING AND SQUEAKING AND SCREECHING
4189-274546-0070 AND CATERWAULING AND SQUALLING AND FLYING INTO THE FACES AND RUNNING UNDER THE PETTICOATS OF THE PEOPLE AND CREATING ALTOGETHER THE MOST ABOMINABLE DIN AND CONFUSION WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A REASONABLE PERSON TO CONCEIVE AND TO MAKE MATTERS STILL MORE DISTRESSING
4189-274546-0071 THE RASCALLY LITTLE SCAPE GRACE IN THE STEEPLE WAS EVIDENTLY EXERTING HIMSELF TO THE UTMOST EVERY NOW AND THEN ONE MIGHT CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE SCOUNDREL THROUGH THE SMOKE THERE HE SAT IN THE BELFRY UPON THE BELFRY MAN WHO WAS LYING FLAT UPON HIS BACK
4189-274546-0072 IN HIS TEETH THE VILLAIN HELD THE BELL ROPE WHICH HE KEPT JERKING ABOUT WITH HIS HEAD RAISING SUCH A CLATTER THAT MY EARS RING AGAIN EVEN TO THINK OF IT ON HIS LAP LAY THE BIG FIDDLE AT WHICH HE WAS SCRAPING OUT OF ALL TIME AND TUNE
4189-274546-0073 WITH BOTH HANDS MAKING A GREAT SHOW THE NINCOMPOOP OF PLAYING JUDY O'FLANNAGAN AND PADDY O'RAFFERTY AFFAIRS BEING THUS MISERABLY SITUATED I LEFT THE PLACE IN DISGUST AND NOW APPEAL FOR AID TO ALL LOVERS OF CORRECT TIME AND FINE KRAUT
