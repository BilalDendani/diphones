4742-74181-0000 PROTECTION OF APERTURE
4742-74181-0001 PIERCED IN THE THICKNESS OF THE WALLS
4742-74181-0002 AND THE FILLINGS OF THE APERTURE ARE UNIMPORTANT IT MAY WELL REMAIN SO BUT WHEN THE FILLINGS ARE DELICATE AND OF VALUE AS IN THE CASE OF COLORED GLASS FINELY WROUGHT TRACERY OR SCULPTURE
4742-74181-0003 AND BACK BY THE BEVEL OF THE APERTURE TO THE JOINTS OR SURFACE OF THE FILLINGS
4742-74181-0004 AND THIS IS THE CHIEF PRACTICAL SERVICE OF APERTURE MOULDINGS WHICH ARE OTHERWISE ENTIRELY DECORATIVE BUT AS THIS VERY DECORATIVE CHARACTER RENDERS THEM UNFIT TO BE MADE CHANNELS FOR RAIN WATER
4742-74181-0005 IT IS WELL TO ADD SOME EXTERNAL ROOFING TO THE APERTURE
4742-74181-0006 THIS PROTECTION IN ITS MOST USUAL FORM
4742-74181-0007 BUT THIS IS IN REALITY ONLY A CONTRACTED FORM OF A TRUE ROOF PROJECTING FROM THE WALL OVER THE APERTURE AND ALL PROTECTIONS OF APERTURES WHATSOEVER ARE TO BE CONCEIVED AS PORTIONS OF SMALL ROOFS
4742-74181-0008 ATTACHED TO THE WALL BEHIND AND SUPPORTED BY IT SO LONG AS THEIR SCALE ADMITS OF THEIR BEING SO WITH SAFETY AND AFTERWARDS IN SUCH MANNER
4742-74181-0009 BUT FOR GENERAL SERVICE THE GABLE IS THE PROPER AND NATURAL FORM AND MAY BE TAKEN AS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE REST THEN THIS GABLE MAY EITHER PROJECT UNSUPPORTED FROM THE WALL
4742-74181-0010 AND THIS IN ITS TURN SUPPORTED BY BRACKETS OR SPURS
4742-74181-0011 IN THE CUMBERLAND AND BORDER COTTAGES THE DOOR IS GENERALLY PROTECTED BY TWO PIECES OF SLATE ARRANGED IN A GABLE GIVING THE PUREST POSSIBLE TYPE OF THE FIRST FORM IN ELABORATE ARCHITECTURE SUCH A PROJECTION HARDLY EVER OCCURS
4742-74181-0012 AND IN LARGE ARCHITECTURE CANNOT WITH SAFETY OCCUR WITHOUT BRACKETS BUT BY CUTTING AWAY THE GREATER PART OF THE PROJECTION WE SHALL ARRIVE AT THE IDEA OF A PLAIN GABLED CORNICE OF WHICH A PERFECT EXAMPLE WILL BE FOUND IN PLATE
4742-74181-0013 WITH THIS FIRST COMPLETE FORM WE MAY ASSOCIATE THE RUDE SINGLE PROJECTING PENTHOUSE ROOF IMPERFECT BECAUSE EITHER IT MUST BE LEVEL
4742-74181-0014 OR THROW OFF THE DRIP UPON THE PERSONS ENTERING
4742-74181-0015 THIS IS A MOST BEAUTIFUL AND NATURAL TYPE AND IS FOUND IN ALL GOOD ARCHITECTURE FROM THE HIGHEST TO THE MOST HUMBLE IT IS A FREQUENT FORM OF COTTAGE DOOR MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN CARRIED ON SPURS BEING OF
4742-74181-0016 PECULIARLY EASY CONSTRUCTION IN WOOD AS APPLIED TO LARGE ARCHITECTURE IT CAN EVIDENTLY BE BUILT IN ITS BOLDEST AND SIMPLEST FORM EITHER OF WOOD ONLY
4742-74181-0017 OR ON A SCALE WHICH WILL ADMIT OF ITS SIDES BEING EACH A SINGLE SLAB OF STONE
4742-74181-0018 OWING TO THE INCREASED BOLDNESS OF THE REQUIRED SUPPORTING ARCH
4742-74181-0019 OF WHICH THE LATTER IS CLEARLY THE BEST
4742-74181-0020 LATERAL THRUST IT MAY BECOME NECESSARY TO PROVIDE FOR ITS FARTHER SAFETY
4742-74181-0021 THIS LAST IS THE PERFECT TYPE OF APERTURE PROTECTION NONE OTHER CAN EVER BE INVENTED SO GOOD IT IS THAT ONCE EMPLOYED BY GIOTTO
4742-74181-0022 AND TORN DOWN BY THE PROVEDITORE BENEDETTO UGUCCIONE TO ERECT A RENAISSANCE FRONT INSTEAD
4742-74181-0023 IN VENICE THE PORCH OF THE CHURCH OF SAINT APOLLINARE ALSO TO PUT UP SOME RENAISSANCE UPHOLSTERY
4742-74181-0024 APPEARS INVARIABLY AS A BEAST OF PREY AND
4742-74181-0025 AND BE DRIVEN INTO THE INTERVALS AND EMBAYED THERE
4742-74181-0026 SO THAT THEY MAY CORRESPOND IN SLOPE OR NEARLY SO WITH THE BEVEL OF THE DOORWAY AND EITHER MEET EACH OTHER IN THE INTERVALS OR HAVE THE SAID INTERVALS CLOSED UP WITH AN INTERMEDIATE WALL
4742-74181-0027 SO THAT NOBODY MAY GET EMBAYED IN THEM THE PORCHES WILL THUS BE UNITED AND FORM ONE RANGE OF GREAT OPEN GULPHS OR CAVERNS
4742-74181-0028 READY TO RECEIVE ALL COMERS AND DIRECT THE CURRENT OF THE CROWD INTO THE NARROWER ENTRANCES AS THE LATERAL THRUST OF THE ARCHES IS NOW MET BY EACH OTHER THE PINNACLES IF THERE WERE ANY MUST BE REMOVED AND
4742-74181-0029 GIOTTO WITH INCONCEIVABLE EXQUISITENESS
4742-74181-0030 THOSE OF THE CATHEDRAL ITSELF BEING ALL OF THE SAME TYPE VARIOUS SINGULAR AND DELIGHTFUL CONDITIONS OF IT ARE APPLIED IN ITALIAN DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE IN THE BROLETTO OF MONZA VERY QUAINTLY
4742-74181-0031 BEING ASSOCIATED WITH BALCONIES FOR SPEAKING TO THE PEOPLE AND PASSING INTO PULPITS
4742-74181-0032 THE SHAPE OF ROOFING BEING THEN NEARLY IMMATERIAL AND VERY FANTASTIC OFTEN A CONICAL CAP ALL THESE CONDITIONS OF WINDOW PROTECTION BEING FOR REAL SERVICE
4742-74181-0033 ARE ENDLESSLY DELIGHTFUL AND I BELIEVE THE BEAUTY OF THE BALCONY PROTECTED BY AN OPEN CANOPY SUPPORTED BY LIGHT SHAFTS NEVER YET TO HAVE BEEN PROPERLY WORKED OUT BUT THE RENAISSANCE ARCHITECTS DESTROYED ALL OF THEM
4742-74181-0034 AND INTRODUCED THE MAGNIFICENT AND WITTY ROMAN INVENTION OF A MODEL OF A GREEK PEDIMENT WITH ITS CORNICES OF MONSTROUS THICKNESS BRACKETED UP ABOVE THE WINDOW THE HORIZONTAL CORNICE OF THE PEDIMENT IS THUS USELESS
4742-74181-0035 AND OF COURSE THEREFORE RETAINED THE PROTECTION TO THE HEAD OF THE WINDOW BEING CONSTRUCTED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF A HAT WITH ITS CROWN SEWN UP BUT THE DEEP AND DARK TRIANGULAR CAVITY THUS OBTAINED
4742-74181-0036 AFFORDS FARTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR PUTTING ORNAMENT OUT OF SIGHT OF WHICH THE RENAISSANCE ARCHITECTS ARE NOT SLOW TO AVAIL THEMSELVES A MORE RATIONAL CONDITION
