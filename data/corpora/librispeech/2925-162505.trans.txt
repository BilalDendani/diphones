2925-162505-0000 LONG AGO THERE LIVED A KING AND HE HAD THREE DAUGHTERS THE LOVELIEST IN ALL THE WORLD HE LOVED THEM SO WELL THAT HE BUILT A PALACE FOR THEM UNDERGROUND LEST THE ROUGH WINDS SHOULD BLOW ON THEM OR THE RED SUN SCORCH THEIR DELICATE FACES
2925-162505-0001 A WONDERFUL PALACE IT WAS DOWN THERE UNDERGROUND WITH FOUNTAINS AND COURTS AND LAMPS BURNING AND PRECIOUS STONES GLITTERING IN THE LIGHT OF THE LAMPS AND THE THREE LOVELY PRINCESSES GREW UP IN THAT PALACE UNDERGROUND
2925-162505-0002 AND KNEW NO OTHER LIGHT BUT THAT OF THE COLOURED LANTERNS AND HAD NEVER SEEN THE BROAD WORLD THAT LIES OPEN UNDER THE SUN BY DAY AND UNDER THE STARS BY NIGHT INDEED THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT THERE WAS A WORLD OUTSIDE THOSE GLITTERING WALLS
2925-162505-0003 ABOVE THAT SHINING CEILING CARVED AND GILDED AND SET WITH PRECIOUS STONES BUT IT SO HAPPENED THAT AMONG THE BOOKS THAT WERE GIVEN THEM TO READ WAS ONE IN WHICH WAS WRITTEN OF THE WORLD HOW THE SUN SHINES IN THE SKY HOW TREES GROW GREEN
2925-162505-0004 HOW THE GRASS WAVES IN THE WIND AND THE LEAVES WHISPER TOGETHER HOW THE RIVERS FLOW BETWEEN THEIR GREEN BANKS AND THROUGH THE FLOWERY MEADOWS UNTIL THEY COME TO THE BLUE SEA THAT JOINS THE EARTH AND THE SKY THEY READ IN THAT BOOK
2925-162505-0005 OF WHITE WALLED TOWNS OF CHURCHES WITH GILDED AND PAINTED DOMES OF THE BROWN WOODEN HUTS OF THE PEASANTS OF THE GREAT FORESTS OF THE SHIPS ON THE RIVERS
2925-162505-0006 AND WHEN THE KING CAME TO SEE THEM AS HE WAS USED TO DO THEY ASKED HIM FATHER IS IT TRUE THAT THERE IS A GARDEN IN THE WORLD YES SAID THE KING AND GREEN GRASS YES SAID THE KING
2925-162505-0007 AND LITTLE SHINING FLOWERS WHY YES SAID THE KING WONDERING AND STROKING HIS SILVER BEARD AND THE THREE LOVELY PRINCESSES ALL BEGGED HIM AT ONCE OH YOUR MAJESTY OUR OWN LITTLE FATHER WHOM
2925-162505-0008 WE LOVE LET US OUT TO SEE THIS WORLD LET US OUT JUST SO THAT WE MAY SEE THIS GARDEN AND WALK IN IT ON THE GREEN GRASS AND SEE THE SHINING FLOWERS THE KING TURNED HIS HEAD AWAY AND TRIED NOT TO LISTEN TO THEM
2925-162505-0009 BUT WHAT COULD HE DO THEY WERE THE LOVELIEST PRINCESSES IN THE WORLD AND WHEN THEY BEGGED HIM JUST TO LET THEM WALK IN THE GARDEN HE COULD SEE THE TEARS IN THEIR EYES AND AFTER ALL HE THOUGHT THERE WERE HIGH WALLS TO THE GARDEN
2925-162505-0010 SO HE CALLED UP HIS ARMY AND SET SOLDIERS ALL ROUND THE GARDEN AND A HUNDRED SOLDIERS TO EACH GATE SO THAT NO ONE SHOULD COME IN AND THEN HE LET THE PRINCESSES COME UP FROM THEIR UNDERGROUND PALACE
2925-162505-0011 AND STEP OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE IN THE GARDEN WITH TEN NURSES AND MAIDS TO EACH PRINCESS TO SEE THAT NO HARM CAME TO HER THE PRINCESSES STEPPED OUT INTO THE GARDEN UNDER THE BLUE SKY
2925-162505-0012 SHADING THEIR EYES AT FIRST BECAUSE THEY HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN IN THE GOLDEN SUNLIGHT SOON THEY WERE TAKING HANDS AND RUNNING THIS WAY AND THAT ALONG THE GARDEN PATHS AND OVER THE GREEN GRASS AND GATHERING POSIES OF SHINING FLOWERS TO SET IN THEIR GIRDLES
2925-162505-0013 AND TO SHAME THEIR GOLDEN CROWNS AND THE KING SAT AND WATCHED THEM WITH LOVE IN HIS EYES
2925-162505-0014 AND THEN WITH ITS SWIFT WHIRLING ARMS IT CAUGHT UP THE THREE LOVELY PRINCESSES AND CARRIED THEM UP INTO THE AIR OVER THE HIGH WALLS AND OVER THE HEADS OF THE GUARDING SOLDIERS FOR A MOMENT THE KING SAW THEM HIS DAUGHTERS THE THREE LOVELY PRINCESSES
2925-162505-0015 SPINNING ROUND AND ROUND AS IF THEY WERE DANCING IN THE SKY A MOMENT LATER THEY WERE NO MORE THAN LITTLE WHIRLING SPECKS LIKE DUST IN THE SUNLIGHT AND THEN THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT AND THE KING AND ALL THE MAIDS AND NURSES WERE ALONE IN THE EMPTY GARDEN
2925-162505-0016 THE NOISE OF THE WIND HAD GONE THE SOLDIERS DID NOT DARE TO SPEAK THE ONLY SOUND IN THE KING'S EARS WAS THE SOBBING AND WEEPING OF THE MAIDS AND NURSES
2925-162505-0017 THE KING CALLED HIS GENERALS AND MADE THEM SEND THE SOLDIERS IN ALL DIRECTIONS OVER THE COUNTRY TO BRING BACK THE PRINCESSES IF THE WHIRLWIND SHOULD TIRE AND SET THEM AGAIN UPON THE GROUND THE SOLDIERS WENT TO THE VERY BOUNDARIES OF THE KINGDOM
2925-162505-0018 BUT THEY CAME BACK AS THEY WENT NOT ONE OF THEM HAD SEEN THE THREE LOVELY PRINCESSES THEN THE KING CALLED TOGETHER ALL HIS FAITHFUL SERVANTS AND PROMISED A GREAT REWARD TO ANY ONE WHO SHOULD BRING NEWS OF THE THREE PRINCESSES
2925-162505-0019 IT WAS THE SAME WITH THE SERVANTS AS WITH THE SOLDIERS FAR AND WIDE THEY GALLOPED OUT SLOWLY ONE BY ONE THEY RODE BACK WITH BENT HEADS ON TIRED HORSES NOT ONE OF THEM HAD SEEN THE KING'S DAUGHTERS
2925-162505-0020 THEN THE KING CALLED A GRAND COUNCIL OF HIS WISE BOYARS AND MEN OF STATE THEY ALL SAT ROUND AND LISTENED AS THE KING TOLD HIS TALE AND ASKED IF ONE OF THEM WOULD NOT UNDERTAKE THE TASK OF FINDING AND RESCUING THE THREE PRINCESSES
2925-162505-0021 AND NOW GOD KNOWS THEY MAY BE IN THE POWER OF WICKED MEN OR WORSE HE SAID HE WOULD GIVE ONE OF THE PRINCESSES IN MARRIAGE TO ANY ONE WHO COULD FOLLOW WHERE THE WIND WENT AND BRING HIS DAUGHTERS BACK YES AND BESIDES
2925-162505-0022 HE WOULD MAKE HIM THE RICHEST MAN IN THE KINGDOM BUT THE BOYARS AND THE WISE MEN OF STATE SAT ROUND IN SILENCE HE ASKED THEM ONE BY ONE THEY WERE ALL SILENT AND AFRAID FOR THEY WERE BOYARS AND WISE MEN OF STATE
2925-162505-0023 AND NOT ONE OF THEM WOULD UNDERTAKE TO FOLLOW THE WHIRLWIND AND RESCUE THE THREE PRINCESSES THE KING WEPT BITTER TEARS I SEE HE SAID I HAVE NO FRIENDS ABOUT ME IN THE PALACE MY SOLDIERS CANNOT
2925-162505-0024 MY SERVANTS CANNOT AND MY BOYARS AND WISE MEN WILL NOT BRING BACK MY THREE SWEET MAIDS WHOM I LOVE BETTER THAN MY KINGDOM AND WITH THAT HE SENT HERALDS THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM TO ANNOUNCE THE NEWS
2925-162505-0025 AND TO ASK IF THERE WERE NONE AMONG THE COMMON FOLK THE MOUJIKS THE SIMPLE FOLK LIKE US WHO WOULD PUT HIS HAND TO THE WORK OF RESCUING THE THREE LOVELY PRINCESSES SINCE NOT ONE OF THE BOYARS AND WISE MEN WAS WILLING TO DO IT
2925-162505-0026 NOW AT THAT TIME IN A CERTAIN VILLAGE LIVED A POOR WIDOW AND SHE HAD THREE SONS STRONG MEN TRUE BOGATIRS AND MEN OF POWER ALL THREE HAD BEEN BORN IN A SINGLE NIGHT
2925-162505-0027 THE ELDEST AT EVENING THE MIDDLE ONE AT MIDNIGHT AND THE YOUNGEST JUST AS THE SKY WAS LIGHTENING WITH THE DAWN FOR THIS REASON THEY WERE CALLED EVENING MIDNIGHT AND SUNRISE
2925-162505-0028 EVENING WAS DUSKY WITH BROWN EYES AND HAIR MIDNIGHT WAS DARK WITH EYES AND HAIR AS BLACK AS CHARCOAL WHILE SUNRISE HAD HAIR GOLDEN AS THE SUN AND EYES BLUE AS MORNING SKY AND ALL THREE
2925-162505-0029 WERE AS STRONG AS ANY OF THE STRONG MEN AND MIGHTY BOGATIRS WHO HAVE SHAKEN THIS LAND OF RUSSIA WITH THEIR TREAD AS SOON AS THE KING'S WORD HAD BEEN PROCLAIMED IN THE VILLAGE THE THREE BROTHERS ASKED FOR THEIR MOTHER'S BLESSING WHICH SHE GAVE THEM
2925-162505-0030 KISSING THEM ON THE FOREHEAD AND ON BOTH CHEEKS THEN THEY MADE READY FOR THE JOURNEY AND RODE OFF TO THE CAPITAL EVENING ON HIS HORSE OF DUSKY BROWN MIDNIGHT ON HIS BLACK HORSE
2925-162505-0031 AND SUNRISE ON HIS HORSE THAT WAS AS WHITE AS CLOUDS IN SUMMER THEY CAME TO THE CAPITAL AND AS THEY RODE THROUGH THE STREETS EVERYBODY STOPPED TO LOOK AT THEM AND ALL THE PRETTY YOUNG WOMEN WAVED HANDKERCHIEFS AT THE WINDOWS
2925-162505-0032 BUT THE THREE BROTHERS LOOKED NEITHER TO RIGHT NOR LEFT BUT STRAIGHT BEFORE THEM AND THEY RODE TO THE PALACE OF THE KING THEY CAME TO THE KING BOWED LOW BEFORE HIM AND SAID MAY YOU LIVE FOR MANY YEARS O KING

2925-162505-0034 EVENING MIDNIGHT AND SUNRISE WHAT WILL YOU HAVE TO TAKE WITH YOU ON THE ROAD FOR OURSELVES O KING WE WANT NOTHING ONLY DO NOT LEAVE OUR MOTHER IN POVERTY FOR SHE IS OLD
2925-162505-0035 THE KING SENT FOR THE OLD WOMAN THEIR MOTHER AND GAVE HER A HOME IN HIS PALACE AND MADE HER EAT AND DRINK AT HIS TABLE AND GAVE HER NEW BOOTS MADE BY HIS OWN COBBLERS AND NEW CLOTHES
2925-162505-0036 WHO WERE USED TO MAKE DRESSES FOR THE THREE DAUGHTERS OF THE KING WHO WERE THE LOVELIEST PRINCESSES IN THE WORLD AND HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY BY THE WHIRLWIND NO OLD WOMAN IN RUSSIA

2925-162505-0038 A MONTH THEY RODE TOGETHER TWO MONTHS AND IN THE THIRD MONTH THEY CAME TO A BROAD DESERT PLAIN WHERE THERE WERE NO TOWNS NO VILLAGES NO FARMS AND NOT A HUMAN BEING TO BE SEEN
2925-162505-0039 THEY RODE ON OVER THE SAND THROUGH THE RANK GRASS OVER THE STONY WASTES AT LAST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DESOLATE PLAIN THEY CAME TO A THICK FOREST THEY FOUND A PATH THROUGH THE THICK UNDERGROWTH
2925-162505-0040 AND RODE ALONG THAT PATH TOGETHER INTO THE VERY HEART OF THE FOREST AND THERE ALONE IN THE HEART OF THE FOREST THEY CAME TO A HUT WITH A RAILED YARD AND A SHED FULL OF CATTLE AND SHEEP
2925-162505-0041 THEY CALLED OUT WITH THEIR STRONG YOUNG VOICES AND WERE ANSWERED BY THE LOWING OF THE CATTLE THE BLEATING OF THE SHEEP AND THE STRONG WIND IN THE TOPS OF THE GREAT TREES THEY RODE THROUGH THE RAILED YARD AND CAME TO THE HUT EVENING

2925-162505-0046 THEY RODE OFF INTO THE FOREST AND DISAPPEARED AMONG THE GREEN TREES EVENING WATCHED THEM OUT OF SIGHT AND THEN WITHOUT THINKING TWICE ABOUT WHAT HE WAS DOING WENT OUT INTO THE YARD PICKED OUT THE FINEST SHEEP HE COULD SEE CAUGHT IT
