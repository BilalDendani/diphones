2319-138631-0000 THE MATCH MAKING VIRTUES OF A DOUBLE GARDEN ANNE WAS SO FLURRIED BY THE MILITARY INCIDENTS ATTENDING HER RETURN HOME THAT SHE WAS ALMOST AFRAID TO VENTURE ALONE OUTSIDE HER MOTHER'S PREMISES
2319-138631-0001 MOREOVER THE NUMEROUS SOLDIERS REGULAR AND OTHERWISE THAT HAUNTED OVERCOMBE AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD WERE GETTING BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE VILLAGERS AND THE RESULT WAS THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS STANDING AT GARDEN GATES WALKING IN THE ORCHARDS
2319-138631-0002 OR SITTING GOSSIPING JUST WITHIN COTTAGE DOORS WITH THE BOWLS OF THEIR TOBACCO PIPES THRUST OUTSIDE FOR POLITENESS SAKE
2319-138631-0003 BEING GENTLEMEN OF A GALLANT AND MOST AFFECTIONATE NATURE THEY NATURALLY TURNED THEIR HEADS AND SMILED IF A PRETTY GIRL PASSED BY WHICH WAS RATHER DISCONCERTING TO THE LATTER IF SHE WERE UNUSED TO SOCIETY
2319-138631-0004 AND WHEN THE BELLES WERE ALL ALLOTTED THOSE WHO SCARCELY DESERVED THAT TITLE HAD THEIR TURN MANY OF THE SOLDIERS BEING NOT AT ALL PARTICULAR ABOUT HALF AN INCH OF NOSE MORE OR LESS A TRIFLING DEFICIENCY OF TEETH OR A LARGER CROP OF FRECKLES
2319-138631-0005 THAN IS CUSTOMARY IN THE SAXON RACE THUS WITH ONE AND ANOTHER COURTSHIP BEGAN TO BE PRACTISED IN OVERCOMBE ON RATHER A LARGE SCALE AND THE DISPOSSESSED YOUNG MEN WHO HAD BEEN BORN IN THE PLACE WERE LEFT TO TAKE THEIR WALKS ALONE
2319-138631-0006 ANNE WATCHED THESE ROMANTIC PROCEEDINGS FROM HER WINDOW WITH MUCH INTEREST AND WHEN SHE SAW HOW TRIUMPHANTLY OTHER HANDSOME GIRLS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WALKED BY ON THE GORGEOUS ARMS OF LIEUTENANT KNOCKHEELMANN
2319-138631-0007 CORNET FLITZENHART AND CAPTAIN KLASPENKISSEN OF THE THRILLING YORK HUSSARS WHO SWORE THE MOST PICTURESQUE FOREIGN OATHS
2319-138631-0008 AND TO LOOK INTO A LITTLE DRAWER AT SOMETHING SOFT AND BROWN THAT LAY IN A CURL THERE WRAPPED IN PAPER AT LAST SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS
2319-138631-0009 WHERE ARE YOU GOING SAID MISSUS GARLAND TO SEE THE FOLKS BECAUSE I AM SO GLOOMY CERTAINLY NOT AT PRESENT ANNE WHY NOT MOTHER SAID ANNE BLUSHING WITH AN INDEFINITE SENSE OF BEING VERY WICKED
2319-138631-0010 BECAUSE YOU MUST NOT I HAVE BEEN GOING TO TELL YOU SEVERAL TIMES NOT TO GO INTO THE STREET AT THIS TIME OF DAY WHY NOT WALK IN THE MORNING THERE'S YOUNG MISTER DERRIMAN WOULD BE GLAD TO
2319-138631-0011 DON'T MENTION HIM MOTHER DON'T WELL THEN DEAR WALK IN THE GARDEN SO POOR ANNE WHO REALLY HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST WISH TO THROW HER HEART AWAY UPON A SOLDIER
2319-138631-0012 TURNED INTO THE INNER GARDEN FROM DAY TO DAY AND PASSED A GOOD MANY HOURS THERE THE PLEASANT BIRDS SINGING TO HER AND THE DELIGHTFUL BUTTERFLIES ALIGHTING ON HER HAT AND THE HORRID ANTS RUNNING UP HER STOCKINGS
2319-138631-0013 THIS GARDEN WAS UNDIVIDED FROM LOVEDAY'S THE TWO HAVING ORIGINALLY BEEN THE SINGLE GARDEN OF THE WHOLE HOUSE IT WAS A QUAINT OLD PLACE ENCLOSED BY A THORN HEDGE SO SHAPELY AND DENSE FROM INCESSANT CLIPPING
2319-138631-0014 THAT THE MILL BOY COULD WALK ALONG THE TOP WITHOUT SINKING IN A FEAT WHICH HE OFTEN PERFORMED AS A MEANS OF FILLING OUT HIS DAY'S WORK THE SOIL WITHIN WAS OF THAT INTENSE FAT BLACKNESS
2319-138631-0015 WHICH IS ONLY SEEN AFTER A CENTURY OF CONSTANT CULTIVATION THE PATHS WERE GRASSED OVER SO THAT PEOPLE CAME AND WENT UPON THEM WITHOUT BEING HEARD THE GRASS HARBOURED SLUGS
2319-138631-0016 AND ON THIS ACCOUNT THE MILLER WAS GOING TO REPLACE IT BY GRAVEL AS SOON AS HE HAD TIME BUT AS HE HAD SAID THIS FOR THIRTY YEARS WITHOUT DOING IT THE GRASS AND THE SLUGS SEEMED LIKELY TO REMAIN
2319-138631-0017 THE MILLER'S MAN ATTENDED TO MISSUS GARLAND'S PIECE OF THE GARDEN AS WELL AS TO THE LARGER PORTION DIGGING PLANTING AND WEEDING INDIFFERENTLY IN BOTH THE MILLER OBSERVING WITH REASON THAT IT WAS NOT WORTH WHILE FOR A HELPLESS WIDOW LADY
2319-138631-0018 AND THEY TALKED FROM PLOT TO PLOT WITH A ZEST AND ANIMATION WHICH MISSUS GARLAND COULD NEVER HAVE ANTICIPATED WHEN SHE FIRST REMOVED THITHER AFTER HER HUSBAND'S DEATH
2319-138631-0019 WAS THE MOST SNUG AND SHELTERED PART OF THIS SNUG AND SHELTERED ENCLOSURE AND IT WAS WELL WATERED AS THE LAND OF LOT
2319-138631-0020 THREE SMALL BROOKS ABOUT A YARD WIDE RAN WITH A TINKLING SOUND FROM SIDE TO SIDE BETWEEN THE PLOTS CROSSING THE PATH UNDER WOOD SLABS LAID AS BRIDGES AND PASSING OUT OF THE GARDEN THROUGH LITTLE TUNNELS IN THE HEDGE
2319-138631-0021 THE BROOKS WERE SO FAR OVERHUNG AT THEIR BRINKS BY GRASS AND GARDEN PRODUCE THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THEIR PERPETUAL BABBLING FEW WOULD HAVE NOTICED THAT THEY WERE THERE THIS WAS WHERE ANNE LIKED BEST TO LINGER
2319-138631-0022 WHEN HER EXCURSIONS BECAME RESTRICTED TO HER OWN PREMISES AND IN A SPOT OF THE GARDEN NOT FAR REMOVED THE TRUMPET MAJOR LOVED TO LINGER ALSO HAVING BY VIRTUE OF HIS OFFICE NO STABLE DUTY TO PERFORM
2319-138631-0023 HE CAME DOWN FROM THE CAMP TO THE MILL ALMOST EVERY DAY AND ANNE FINDING THAT HE ADROITLY WALKED AND SAT IN HIS FATHER'S PORTION OF THE GARDEN WHENEVER SHE DID SO IN THE OTHER HALF COULD NOT HELP SMILING AND SPEAKING TO HIM
2319-138631-0024 SO HIS EPAULETTES AND BLUE JACKET AND ANNE'S YELLOW GIPSY HAT WERE OFTEN SEEN IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE GARDEN AT THE SAME TIME BUT HE NEVER INTRUDED INTO HER PART OF THE ENCLOSURE NOR DID SHE INTO LOVEDAY'S
2319-138631-0025 SHE ALWAYS SPOKE TO HIM WHEN SHE SAW HIM THERE AND HE REPLIED IN DEEP FIRM ACCENTS ACROSS THE GOOSEBERRY BUSHES OR THROUGH THE TALL ROWS OF FLOWERING PEAS AS THE CASE MIGHT BE HE THUS GAVE HER ACCOUNTS AT FIFTEEN PACES
2319-138631-0026 OF HIS EXPERIENCES IN CAMP IN QUARTERS IN FLANDERS AND ELSEWHERE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LINE AND COLUMN OF FORCED MARCHES BILLETING AND SUCH LIKE TOGETHER WITH HIS HOPES OF PROMOTION ANNE LISTENED AT FIRST INDIFFERENTLY
2319-138631-0027 BUT KNOWING NO ONE ELSE SO GOOD NATURED AND EXPERIENCED SHE GREW INTERESTED IN HIM AS IN A BROTHER BY DEGREES HIS GOLD LACE BUCKLES AND SPURS LOST ALL THEIR STRANGENESS AND WERE AS FAMILIAR TO HER AS HER OWN CLOTHES
2319-138631-0028 AT LAST MISSUS GARLAND NOTICED THIS GROWING FRIENDSHIP AND BEGAN TO DESPAIR OF HER MOTHERLY SCHEME OF UNITING ANNE TO THE MONEYED FESTUS WHY SHE COULD NOT TAKE PROMPT STEPS TO CHECK INTERFERENCE WITH HER PLANS
2319-138631-0029 AROSE PARTLY FROM HER NATURE WHICH WAS THE REVERSE OF MANAGING AND PARTLY FROM A NEW EMOTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCE WITH WHICH SHE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO RECKON THE NEAR NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT HAD PRODUCED THE FRIENDSHIP OF ANNE FOR JOHN LOVEDAY
2319-138631-0030 WAS SLOWLY EFFECTING A WARMER LIKING BETWEEN HER MOTHER AND HIS FATHER THUS THE MONTH OF JULY PASSED THE TROOP HORSES CAME WITH THE REGULARITY OF CLOCKWORK TWICE A DAY DOWN TO DRINK UNDER HER WINDOW
2319-138631-0031 AND AS THE WEATHER GREW HOTTER KICKED UP THEIR HEELS AND SHOOK THEIR HEADS FURIOUSLY UNDER THE MADDENING STING OF THE DUN FLY THE GREEN LEAVES IN THE GARDEN BECAME OF A DARKER DYE THE GOOSEBERRIES RIPENED
2319-138631-0032 AND THE THREE BROOKS WERE REDUCED TO HALF THEIR WINTER VOLUME AT LENGTH THE EARNEST TRUMPET MAJOR OBTAINED MISSUS GARLAND'S CONSENT TO TAKE HER AND HER DAUGHTER TO THE CAMP WHICH THEY HAD NOT YET VIEWED FROM ANY CLOSER POINT THAN THEIR OWN WINDOWS
2319-138631-0033 SO ONE AFTERNOON THEY WENT THE MILLER BEING ONE OF THE PARTY THE VILLAGERS WERE BY THIS TIME DRIVING A ROARING TRADE WITH THE SOLDIERS WHO PURCHASED OF THEM EVERY DESCRIPTION OF GARDEN PRODUCE MILK BUTTER AND EGGS AT LIBERAL PRICES
2319-138631-0034 THE FIGURES OF THESE RURAL SUTLERS COULD BE SEEN CREEPING UP THE SLOPES LADEN LIKE BEES TO A SPOT IN THE REAR OF THE CAMP WHERE THERE WAS A KIND OF MARKET PLACE ON THE GREENSWARD MISSUS GARLAND ANNE AND THE MILLER
2319-138631-0035 WERE CONDUCTED FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER AND ON TO THE QUARTER WHERE THE SOLDIERS WIVES LIVED WHO HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET LODGINGS IN THE COTTAGES NEAR THE MOST SHELTERED PLACE HAD BEEN CHOSEN FOR THEM AND SNUG HUTS HAD BEEN BUILT FOR THEIR USE BY THEIR HUSBANDS
2319-138631-0036 OF CLODS HURDLES A LITTLE THATCH OR WHATEVER THEY COULD LAY HANDS ON THE TRUMPET MAJOR CONDUCTED HIS FRIENDS THENCE TO THE LARGE BARN WHICH HAD BEEN APPROPRIATED AS A HOSPITAL AND TO THE COTTAGE WITH ITS WINDOWS BRICKED UP THAT WAS USED AS THE MAGAZINE
2319-138631-0037 THEN THEY INSPECTED THE LINES OF SHINING DARK HORSES EACH REPRESENTING THE THEN HIGH FIGURE OF TWO AND TWENTY GUINEAS PURCHASE MONEY STANDING PATIENTLY AT THE ROPES WHICH STRETCHED FROM ONE PICKET POST TO ANOTHER
2319-138631-0038 A BANK BEING THROWN UP IN FRONT OF THEM AS A PROTECTION AT NIGHT THEY PASSED ON TO THE TENTS OF THE GERMAN LEGION A WELL GROWN AND RATHER DANDY SET OF MEN WITH A POETICAL LOOK ABOUT THEIR FACES
2319-138631-0039 WHICH RENDERED THEM INTERESTING TO FEMININE EYES HANOVERIANS SAXONS PRUSSIANS SWEDES HUNGARIANS AND OTHER FOREIGNERS WERE NUMBERED IN THEIR RANKS THEY WERE CLEANING ARMS WHICH THEY LEANT CAREFULLY AGAINST A RAIL WHEN THE WORK WAS COMPLETE
2319-138631-0040 ON THEIR RETURN THEY PASSED THE MESS HOUSE A TEMPORARY WOODEN BUILDING WITH A BRICK CHIMNEY AS ANNE AND HER COMPANIONS WENT BY A GROUP OF THREE OR FOUR OF THE HUSSARS WERE STANDING AT THE DOOR TALKING TO A DASHING YOUNG MAN
2319-138631-0041 WHO WAS EXPATIATING ON THE QUALITIES OF A HORSE THAT ONE WAS INCLINED TO BUY ANNE RECOGNIZED FESTUS DERRIMAN IN THE SELLER AND CRIPPLESTRAW WAS TROTTING THE ANIMAL UP AND DOWN AS SOON AS SHE CAUGHT THE YEOMAN'S EYE
2319-138631-0042 HE CAME FORWARD MAKING SOME FRIENDLY REMARK TO THE MILLER AND THEN TURNING TO MISS GARLAND WHO KEPT HER EYES STEADILY FIXED ON THE DISTANT LANDSCAPE TILL HE GOT SO NEAR THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO SO LONGER
2319-138631-0043 HE SAID TO HER IN A LOW VOICE OF REPRESSED RESENTMENT NO SAID ANNE WHEN ARE YOU COMING TO THE HALL AGAIN NEVER PERHAPS NONSENSE ANNE SAID MISSUS GARLAND
2319-138631-0044 YOU CAN GO AT ANY TIME AS USUAL LET HER COME WITH ME NOW MISSUS GARLAND I SHOULD BE PLEASED TO WALK ALONG WITH HER
2319-138631-0045 THE WIDOW LOOKED UNHAPPILY IN HER DAUGHTER'S FACE DISTRESSED BETWEEN HER DESIRE THAT ANNE SHOULD ENCOURAGE FESTUS AND HER WISH TO CONSULT ANNE'S OWN FEELINGS LEAVE HER ALONE LEAVE HER ALONE SAID FESTUS HIS GAZE BLACKENING
2319-138631-0046 NOW I THINK OF IT I AM GLAD SHE CAN'T COME WITH ME FOR I AM ENGAGED AND HE STALKED AWAY ANNE MOVED ON WITH HER MOTHER YOUNG LOVEDAY SILENTLY FOLLOWING AND THEY BEGAN TO DESCEND THE HILL

2319-138631-0049 FOR THE RENCOUNTER WITH FESTUS HAD DAMPED THE SPIRITS OF BOTH AT LAST THE WIDOW'S PRIVATE TALK WITH MILLER LOVEDAY CAME TO AN END AND SHE HASTENED ONWARD THE MILLER GOING IN ANOTHER DIRECTION TO MEET A MAN ON BUSINESS
2319-138631-0050 WHEN SHE REACHED THE TRUMPET MAJOR AND ANNE SHE WAS LOOKING VERY BRIGHT AND RATHER FLURRIED AND SEEMED SORRY WHEN LOVEDAY SAID THAT HE MUST LEAVE THEM AND RETURN TO THE CAMP THEY PARTED IN THEIR USUAL FRIENDLY MANNER AND ANNE AND HER MOTHER WERE LEFT TO WALK
