4806-26894-0000 I THOUGHT I COULD EVEN DETECT A CERTAIN SHAMEFACEDNESS IN THE GENERAL'S GLANCE MARIA PHILIPOVNA
4806-26894-0001 TO LUNCHEON THERE WERE EXPECTED THAT DAY A MONSIEUR MEZENTSOV A FRENCH LADY AND AN ENGLISHMAN FOR WHENEVER MONEY WAS IN HAND A BANQUET IN MUSCOVITE STYLE WAS ALWAYS GIVEN POLINA ALEXANDROVNA ON SEEING ME INQUIRED WHY I HAD BEEN SO LONG AWAY
4806-26894-0002 THEN WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER SHE DEPARTED EVIDENTLY THIS WAS NOT MERE ACCIDENT AND I FELT THAT I MUST THROW SOME LIGHT UPON MATTERS IT WAS HIGH TIME THAT I DID SO
4806-26894-0003 SO FAR AS I COULD SEE THE PARTY HAD ALREADY GAINED SOME NOTORIETY IN THE PLACE WHICH HAD COME TO LOOK UPON THE GENERAL AS A RUSSIAN NOBLEMAN OF GREAT WEALTH
4806-26894-0004 LATER I WAS ABOUT TO TAKE MISCHA AND NADIA FOR A WALK WHEN A SUMMONS REACHED ME FROM THE STAIRCASE THAT I MUST ATTEND THE GENERAL
4806-26894-0005 HE WANTED TO DO SO BUT EACH TIME WAS MET BY ME WITH SUCH A FIXED DISRESPECTFUL STARE THAT HE DESISTED IN CONFUSION IN POMPOUS LANGUAGE HOWEVER WHICH JUMBLED ONE SENTENCE INTO ANOTHER AND AT LENGTH GREW DISCONNECTED HE GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND
4806-26894-0006 THAT I WAS TO LEAD THE CHILDREN ALTOGETHER AWAY FROM THE CASINO AND OUT INTO THE PARK FINALLY HIS ANGER EXPLODED AND HE ADDED SHARPLY
4806-26894-0007 WELL EXCUSE MY SPEAKING SO PLAINLY BUT I KNOW HOW ADDICTED YOU ARE TO GAMBLING THOUGH I AM NOT YOUR MENTOR NOR WISH TO BE AT LEAST I HAVE A RIGHT TO REQUIRE THAT YOU SHALL NOT ACTUALLY COMPROMISE ME I HAVE NO MONEY FOR GAMBLING I QUIETLY REPLIED
4806-26894-0008 LET US CALCULATE HE WENT ON WE MUST TRANSLATE THESE ROUBLES INTO THALERS HERE
4806-26894-0009 THE REST WILL BE SAFE IN MY HANDS IN SILENCE I TOOK THE MONEY YOU MUST NOT BE OFFENDED AT WHAT I SAY HE CONTINUED YOU ARE TOO TOUCHY ABOUT THESE THINGS
4806-26894-0010 WHEN RETURNING HOME WITH THE CHILDREN BEFORE LUNCHEON I MET A CAVALCADE OF OUR PARTY RIDING TO VIEW SOME RUINS TWO SPLENDID CARRIAGES MAGNIFICENTLY HORSED WITH MLLE BLANCHE MARIA PHILIPOVNA AND POLINA ALEXANDROVNA IN ONE OF THEM
4806-26894-0011 AND THE FRENCHMAN THE ENGLISHMAN AND THE GENERAL IN ATTENDANCE ON HORSEBACK THE PASSERS BY STOPPED TO STARE AT THEM FOR THE EFFECT WAS SPLENDID THE GENERAL COULD NOT HAVE IMPROVED UPON IT I CALCULATED THAT WITH THE FOUR THOUSAND FRANCS WHICH I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME
4806-26894-0012 THOUGH THAT WOULD BE NONE TOO MUCH FOR MLLE BLANCHE WHO WITH HER MOTHER AND THE FRENCHMAN WAS ALSO LODGING IN OUR HOTEL
4806-26894-0013 AND MLLE BLANCHE'S MOTHER WAS DUBBED MADAME LA COMTESSE PERHAPS IN VERY TRUTH THEY WERE COMTE ET COMTESSE I KNEW THAT MONSIEUR LE COMTE WOULD TAKE NO NOTICE OF ME WHEN WE MET AT DINNER AS ALSO THAT THE GENERAL WOULD NOT DREAM OF INTRODUCING US NOR OF RECOMMENDING ME TO THE COMTE
4806-26894-0014 OF COURSE STRICTLY SPEAKING HE KNEW ME
4806-26894-0015 THE GENERAL HAD FORGOTTEN TO ARRANGE OTHERWISE OR I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED TO DINE AT THE TABLE D'HOTE NEVERTHELESS
4806-26894-0016 AND THOUGH THE GOOD MARIA PHILIPOVNA WAS FOR SHOWING ME MY PLACE THE FACT OF MY HAVING PREVIOUSLY MET THE ENGLISHMAN MISTER ASTLEY SAVED ME
4806-26894-0017 TO THINK THEREFORE THAT I SHOULD SUDDENLY ENCOUNTER HIM AGAIN HERE IN ROULETTENBERG NEVER IN MY LIFE HAD I KNOWN A MORE RETIRING MAN FOR HE WAS SHY TO THE PITCH OF IMBECILITY YET WELL AWARE OF THE FACT FOR HE WAS NO FOOL
4806-26894-0018 ALSO HE WAS DELIGHTED THAT I SHOULD SIT NEXT HIM AT TABLE
4806-26894-0019 DURING THE MEAL THE FRENCHMAN WAS IN GREAT FEATHER HE WAS DISCURSIVE AND POMPOUS TO EVERY ONE IN MOSCOW TOO I REMEMBERED HE HAD BLOWN A GREAT MANY BUBBLES INTERMINABLY HE DISCOURSED ON FINANCE AND RUSSIAN POLITICS AND THOUGH AT TIMES THE GENERAL MADE FEINTS TO CONTRADICT HIM
4806-26894-0020 HE DID SO HUMBLY AND AS THOUGH WISHING NOT WHOLLY TO LOSE SIGHT OF HIS OWN DIGNITY
4806-26894-0021 WHY DO I CONTINUE TO DANCE ATTENDANCE UPON THE GENERAL
4806-26894-0022 FIRST OF ALL I SUDDENLY AND FOR NO REASON WHATEVER PLUNGED LOUDLY AND GRATUITOUSLY INTO THE GENERAL CONVERSATION ABOVE EVERYTHING I WANTED TO PICK A QUARREL WITH THE FRENCHMAN AND WITH THAT END IN VIEW I TURNED TO THE GENERAL AND EXCLAIMED IN AN OVERBEARING SORT OF WAY
4806-26894-0023 THE GENERAL BENT UPON ME A GLANCE OF ASTONISHMENT IF ONE IS A MAN OF SELF RESPECT I WENT ON
4806-26894-0024 BOTH AT PARIS AND ON THE RHINE AND EVEN IN SWITZERLAND THERE ARE SO MANY POLES WITH THEIR SYMPATHISERS THE FRENCH AT THESE TABLES D'HOTE THAT ONE CANNOT GET A WORD IN EDGEWAYS IF ONE HAPPENS ONLY TO BE A RUSSIAN THIS I SAID IN FRENCH
4806-26894-0025 THE GENERAL EYED ME DOUBTFULLY FOR HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO BE ANGRY OR MERELY TO FEEL SURPRISED THAT I SHOULD SO FAR FORGET MYSELF OF COURSE ONE ALWAYS LEARNS SOMETHING EVERYWHERE SAID THE FRENCHMAN IN A CARELESS CONTEMPTUOUS SORT OF TONE IN PARIS TOO I HAD A DISPUTE WITH A POLE I CONTINUED
4806-26894-0026 AFTER THAT A SECTION OF THE FRENCHMEN PRESENT TOOK MY PART THEY DID SO AS SOON AS I TOLD THEM THE STORY OF HOW ONCE I THREATENED TO SPIT INTO MONSIGNOR'S COFFEE
4806-26894-0027 AND A STARE OF ASTONISHMENT WHILE THE FRENCHMAN LOOKED AT ME UNBELIEVINGLY JUST SO I REPLIED YOU MUST KNOW THAT ON ONE OCCASION WHEN FOR TWO DAYS I HAD FELT CERTAIN THAT AT ANY MOMENT I MIGHT HAVE TO DEPART FOR ROME ON BUSINESS
4806-26894-0028 AFTER LISTENING POLITELY BUT WITH GREAT RESERVE
4806-26894-0029 I WAS IN A GREAT HURRY TO DEPART BUT OF COURSE I SAT DOWN PULLED OUT A COPY OF L'OPINION NATIONALE AND FELL TO READING AN EXTRAORDINARY PIECE OF INVECTIVE AGAINST RUSSIA WHICH IT HAPPENED TO CONTAIN
4806-26894-0030 AFTER WHICH I SAW THE SACRISTAN MAKE A LOW BOW TO THE VISITOR AND THEN ANOTHER BOW AS THE VISITOR TOOK HIS LEAVE
4806-26894-0031 HE AGAIN ASKED ME TO WAIT SOON A THIRD VISITOR ARRIVED WHO LIKE MYSELF HAD COME ON BUSINESS
4806-26894-0032 THIS MADE ME VERY ANGRY I ROSE APPROACHED THE SACRISTAN AND TOLD HIM THAT
4806-26894-0033 SHOULD DARE TO COMPARE HIMSELF WITH OTHER VISITORS OF MONSIGNOR'S
4806-26894-0034 DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT MONSIGNOR IS GOING TO PUT ASIDE HIS COFFEE FOR YOU BUT I ONLY CRIED THE LOUDER LET ME TELL YOU THAT I AM GOING TO SPIT INTO THAT COFFEE
4806-26894-0035 WHILE HE IS ENGAGED WITH A CARDINAL SCREECHED THE SACRISTAN AGAIN SHRINKING BACK IN HORROR THEN RUSHING TO THE DOOR HE SPREAD OUT HIS ARMS AS THOUGH HE WOULD RATHER DIE THAN LET ME ENTER THEREUPON I DECLARED THAT I WAS A HERETIC AND A BARBARIAN
4806-26894-0036 IN A WORD I SHOWED HIM THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE WAY
4806-26894-0037 SI BETE BUT IS THAT HOW RUSSIAN SUBJECTS OUGHT TO BE TREATED WHY WHEN THEY SETTLE HERE THEY DARE NOT UTTER EVEN A WORD
4806-26894-0038 AT ONCE WENT UPSTAIRS WHILE SOME OF THE FRENCHMEN WERE SIMPLY DISGUSTED WHEN I TOLD THEM THAT TWO YEARS AGO I HAD ENCOUNTERED A MAN AT WHOM IN EIGHTEEN TWELVE A FRENCH HERO FIRED FOR THE MERE FUN OF DISCHARGING HIS MUSKET
4806-26894-0039 NO FRENCH SOLDIER WOULD FIRE AT A CHILD NEVERTHELESS THE INCIDENT WAS AS I SAY I REPLIED A VERY RESPECTED EX CAPTAIN TOLD ME THE STORY AND I MYSELF COULD SEE THE SCAR LEFT ON HIS CHEEK THE FRENCHMAN THEN BEGAN CHATTERING VOLUBLY AND THE GENERAL SUPPORTED HIM
4806-26894-0040 THE GENERAL WAS FURIOUS WITH ME FOR HAVING STARTED THE ALTERCATION WITH THE FRENCHMAN
4806-26894-0041 AND RISING FROM THE TABLE PROPOSED THAT WE SHOULD GO AND HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER
4806-26894-0042 OF COURSE WE BEGAN BY TALKING ON BUSINESS MATTERS POLINA SEEMED FURIOUS WHEN I HANDED HER ONLY SEVEN HUNDRED GULDEN
4806-26894-0043 AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND GULDEN OR EVEN MORE COME WHAT MAY I MUST HAVE MONEY SHE SAID AND GET IT SOMEHOW I WILL OTHERWISE I SHALL BE RUINED
4806-26894-0044 NOTHING EXCEPT THAT TWO PIECES OF NEWS HAVE REACHED US FROM SAINT PETERSBURG IN THE FIRST PLACE MY GRANDMOTHER IS VERY ILL AND UNLIKELY TO LAST ANOTHER COUPLE OF DAYS WE HAD THIS FROM TIMOTHY PETROVITCH HIMSELF AND HE IS A RELIABLE PERSON
4806-26894-0045 ALL OF YOU ARE ON THE TIPTOE OF EXPECTATION I QUERIED OF COURSE
4806-26894-0046 LOOKING FOR IT YES LOOKING FOR IT I AM NOT HER BLOOD RELATION YOU KNOW
4806-26894-0047 YET I AM CERTAIN THAT THE OLD LADY HAS REMEMBERED ME IN HER WILL YES I BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL COME IN FOR A GOOD DEAL I SAID WITH SOME ASSURANCE YES FOR SHE IS FOND OF ME BUT HOW COME YOU TO THINK SO I ANSWERED THIS QUESTION WITH ANOTHER ONE THAT MARQUIS OF YOURS I SAID
4806-26894-0048 IS HE ALSO FAMILIAR WITH YOUR FAMILY SECRETS
4806-26894-0049 WHAT LOVING FRIENDLY BEHAVIOUR TO BE SURE YES THAT IS TRUE
4806-26894-0050 I THOUGHT YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THAT THEN HE HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN HIS COURTING WHY I THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN DOING SO A LONG WHILE YOU KNOW HE HAS NOT RETORTED POLINA ANGRILY
4806-26894-0051 HE IS VERY SHY I SAID AND SUSCEPTIBLE ALSO HE IS IN LOVE WITH YOU YES HE IS IN LOVE WITH ME SHE REPLIED AND HE IS TEN TIMES RICHER THAN THE FRENCHMAN IN FACT WHAT DOES THE FRENCHMAN POSSESS TO ME IT SEEMS AT LEAST DOUBTFUL THAT HE POSSESSES ANYTHING AT ALL
4806-26894-0052 OH NO THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT HE DOES POSSESS SOME CHATEAU OR OTHER LAST NIGHT THE GENERAL TOLD ME THAT FOR CERTAIN NOW ARE YOU SATISFIED NEVERTHELESS IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD MARRY THE ENGLISHMAN AND WHY ASKED POLINA BECAUSE THOUGH THE FRENCHMAN IS THE HANDSOMER OF THE TWO
4806-26894-0053 HE IS ALSO THE BASER WHEREAS THE ENGLISHMAN IS NOT ONLY A MAN OF HONOUR BUT TEN TIMES THE WEALTHIER OF THE PAIR YES BUT THEN THE FRENCHMAN IS A MARQUIS AND THE CLEVERER OF THE TWO REMARKED POLINA IMPERTURBABLY IS THAT SO I REPEATED YES ABSOLUTELY
4806-26894-0054 BUT I TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS IT AMUSES ME TO SEE YOU GROW ANGRY SHE CONTINUED HOWEVER INASMUCH AS I ALLOW YOU TO INDULGE IN THESE QUESTIONS AND CONJECTURES YOU OUGHT TO PAY ME SOMETHING FOR THE PRIVILEGE
4806-26894-0055 YES YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT THAT I SHALL DO SO I HATE YOU BECAUSE I HAVE ALLOWED YOU TO GO TO SUCH LENGTHS AND I ALSO HATE YOU AND STILL MORE BECAUSE YOU ARE SO NECESSARY TO ME FOR THE TIME BEING I WANT YOU SO I MUST KEEP YOU
4806-26894-0056 YOU KNOW WHO SHE IS JUST MLLE BLANCHE
4806-26894-0057 PROBABLY SHE WILL SOON BE MADAME GENERAL THAT IS TO SAY IF THE RUMOURS THAT GRANDMAMMA IS NEARING HER END SHOULD PROVE TRUE
4806-26894-0058 LISTEN TO ME TAKE THESE SEVEN HUNDRED FLORINS AND GO AND PLAY ROULETTE WITH THEM WIN AS MUCH FOR ME AS YOU CAN FOR I AM BADLY IN NEED OF MONEY
4806-26894-0059 SOMETHING HAD SEEMED TO STRIKE MY BRAIN WHEN SHE TOLD ME TO GO AND PLAY ROULETTE
4806-26894-0060 ON THE DAY OF MY RETURN ALTHOUGH WHILE TRAVELLING I HAD MOPED LIKE AN IMBECILE
4806-26894-0061 INDEED ON ONE OCCASION THIS HAPPENED IN SWITZERLAND WHEN I WAS ASLEEP IN THE TRAIN
4806-26894-0062 AGAIN THEREFORE I PUT TO MYSELF THE QUESTION DO I OR DO I NOT LOVE HER AND AGAIN I COULD RETURN MYSELF NO ANSWER OR RATHER FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME I TOLD MYSELF THAT I DETESTED HER YES I DETESTED HER
4806-26894-0063 YET I ALSO SWEAR THAT IF ON THE SHLANGENBERG SHE HAD REALLY SAID TO ME LEAP INTO THAT ABYSS I SHOULD HAVE LEAPT INTO IT AND WITH EQUAL PLEASURE YES THIS I KNEW WELL ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THE THING MUST SOON BE ENDED
4806-26894-0064 AND OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF MY EVER REALISING MY DREAMS AFFORDED HER I AM CERTAIN THE KEENEST POSSIBLE PLEASURE
4806-26894-0065 WOULD HAVE INDULGED IN THIS FAMILIARITY AND OPENNESS WITH ME HITHERTO I CONCLUDED SHE HAD LOOKED UPON ME IN THE SAME LIGHT THAT THE OLD EMPRESS DID UPON HER SERVANT THE EMPRESS WHO HESITATED NOT TO UNROBE HERSELF BEFORE HER SLAVE SINCE SHE DID NOT ACCOUNT A SLAVE A MAN YES OFTEN POLINA MUST HAVE TAKEN ME FOR SOMETHING LESS THAN A MAN
