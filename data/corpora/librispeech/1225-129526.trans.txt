1225-129526-0000 AND MURCHISON THE ENGINEER RE EMBARKED ON BOARD THE TAMPICO FOR NEW ORLEANS HIS OBJECT WAS TO ENLIST AN ARMY OF WORKMEN AND TO COLLECT TOGETHER THE GREATER PART OF THE MATERIALS
1225-129526-0001 BY THE AID OF THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY EIGHT DAYS AFTER ITS DEPARTURE THE TAMPICO RETURNED INTO THE BAY OF ESPIRITU SANTO WITH A WHOLE FLOTILLA OF STEAMBOATS MURCHISON HAD SUCCEEDED IN ASSEMBLING TOGETHER FIFTEEN HUNDRED ARTISANS
1225-129526-0002 ATTRACTED BY THE HIGH PAY AND CONSIDERABLE BOUNTIES OFFERED BY THE GUN CLUB HE HAD ENLISTED A CHOICE LEGION OF STOKERS IRON FOUNDERS LIME BURNERS MINERS BRICKMAKERS AND ARTISANS OF EVERY TRADE WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF COLOR
1225-129526-0003 AS MANY OF THESE PEOPLE BROUGHT THEIR FAMILIES WITH THEM
1225-129526-0004 AND ONE MAY IMAGINE THE ACTIVITY WHICH PERVADED THAT LITTLE TOWN WHOSE POPULATION WAS THUS DOUBLED IN A SINGLE DAY DURING THE FIRST FEW DAYS THEY WERE BUSY DISCHARGING THE CARGO BROUGHT BY THE FLOTILLA THE MACHINES AND THE RATIONS
1225-129526-0005 SEPARATELY PIECED AND NUMBERED AT THE SAME PERIOD BARBICANE LAID THE FIRST SLEEPERS OF A RAILWAY FIFTEEN MILES IN LENGTH INTENDED TO UNITE STONES HILL WITH TAMPA TOWN ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER BARBICANE QUITTED TAMPA TOWN WITH A DETACHMENT OF WORKMEN
1225-129526-0006 AND ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE WHOLE TOWN OF HUTS WAS ERECTED ROUND STONES HILL THIS THEY ENCLOSED WITH PALISADES AND IN RESPECT OF ENERGY AND ACTIVITY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN FOR ONE OF THE GREAT CITIES OF THE UNION
1225-129526-0007 AND THE WORKS WERE COMMENCED IN MOST PERFECT ORDER THE NATURE OF THE SOIL HAVING BEEN CAREFULLY EXAMINED BY MEANS OF REPEATED BORINGS THE WORK OF EXCAVATION WAS FIXED FOR THE FOURTH OF NOVEMBER
1225-129526-0008 ON THAT DAY BARBICANE CALLED TOGETHER HIS FOREMEN AND ADDRESSED THEM AS FOLLOWS YOU ARE WELL AWARE MY FRIENDS OF THE OBJECT WITH WHICH I HAVE ASSEMBLED YOU TOGETHER IN THIS WILD PART OF FLORIDA
1225-129526-0009 OUR BUSINESS IS TO CONSTRUCT A CANNON MEASURING NINE FEET IN ITS INTERIOR DIAMETER SIX FEET THICK AND WITH A STONE REVETMENT OF NINETEEN AND A HALF FEET IN THICKNESS
1225-129526-0010 WE HAVE THEREFORE A WELL OF SIXTY FEET IN DIAMETER TO DIG DOWN TO A DEPTH OF NINE HUNDRED FEET
1225-129526-0011 THAT IS TO SAY IN ROUND NUMBERS TWO THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER DAY THAT WHICH WOULD PRESENT NO DIFFICULTY TO A THOUSAND NAVVIES WORKING IN OPEN COUNTRY WILL BE OF COURSE MORE TROUBLESOME IN A COMPARATIVELY CONFINED SPACE
1225-129526-0012 HOWEVER THE THING MUST BE DONE AND I RECKON FOR ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT UPON YOUR COURAGE AS MUCH AS UPON YOUR SKILL AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING THE FIRST STROKE OF THE PICKAXE WAS STRUCK UPON THE SOIL OF FLORIDA AND FROM THAT MOMENT
1225-129526-0013 THAT PRINCE OF TOOLS WAS NEVER INACTIVE FOR ONE MOMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE EXCAVATORS THE GANGS RELIEVED EACH OTHER EVERY THREE HOURS ON THE FOURTH OF NOVEMBER FIFTY WORKMEN COMMENCED DIGGING IN THE VERY CENTER OF THE ENCLOSED SPACE ON THE SUMMIT OF STONES HILL
1225-129526-0014 A CIRCULAR HOLE SIXTY FEET IN DIAMETER THE PICKAXE FIRST STRUCK UPON A KIND OF BLACK EARTH SIX INCHES IN THICKNESS WHICH WAS SPEEDILY DISPOSED OF TO THIS EARTH SUCCEEDED TWO FEET OF FINE SAND
1225-129526-0015 WHICH WAS CAREFULLY LAID ASIDE AS BEING VALUABLE FOR SERVING THE CASTING OF THE INNER MOULD AFTER THE SAND APPEARED SOME COMPACT WHITE CLAY RESEMBLING THE CHALK OF GREAT BRITAIN WHICH EXTENDED DOWN TO A DEPTH OF FOUR FEET
1225-129526-0016 THEN THE IRON OF THE PICKS STRUCK UPON THE HARD BED OF THE SOIL A KIND OF ROCK FORMED OF PETRIFIED SHELLS VERY DRY VERY SOLID AND WHICH THE PICKS COULD WITH DIFFICULTY PENETRATE
1225-129526-0017 AT THIS POINT THE EXCAVATION EXHIBITED A DEPTH OF SIX AND A HALF FEET
1225-129526-0018 A KIND OF CIRCLE STRONGLY BOLTED TOGETHER AND OF IMMENSE STRENGTH THE CENTER OF THIS WOODEN DISC WAS HOLLOWED OUT TO A DIAMETER EQUAL TO THE EXTERIOR DIAMETER OF THE COLUMBIAD UPON THIS WHEEL RESTED THE FIRST LAYERS OF THE MASONRY
1225-129526-0019 THE STONES OF WHICH WERE BOUND TOGETHER BY HYDRAULIC CEMENT WITH IRRESISTIBLE TENACITY
1225-129526-0020 WHEN THIS WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED THE MINERS RESUMED THEIR PICKS AND CUT AWAY THE ROCK FROM UNDERNEATH THE WHEEL ITSELF TAKING CARE TO SUPPORT IT AS THEY ADVANCED UPON BLOCKS OF GREAT THICKNESS AT EVERY TWO FEET WHICH THE HOLE GAINED IN DEPTH THEY SUCCESSIVELY WITHDREW THE BLOCKS
1225-129526-0021 THE WHEEL THEN SANK LITTLE BY LITTLE AND WITH IT THE MASSIVE RING OF MASONRY ON THE UPPER BED OF WHICH THE MASONS LABORED INCESSANTLY ALWAYS RESERVING SOME VENT HOLES TO PERMIT THE ESCAPE OF GAS DURING THE OPERATION OF THE CASTING
1225-129526-0022 THIS KIND OF WORK REQUIRED ON THE PART OF THE WORKMEN EXTREME NICETY AND MINUTE ATTENTION MORE THAN ONE IN DIGGING UNDERNEATH THE WHEEL WAS DANGEROUSLY INJURED BY THE SPLINTERS OF STONE BUT THEIR ARDOR NEVER RELAXED NIGHT OR DAY
1225-129526-0023 BY DAY THEY WORKED UNDER THE RAYS OF THE SCORCHING SUN BY NIGHT UNDER THE GLEAM OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT THE SOUNDS OF THE PICKS AGAINST THE ROCK THE BURSTING OF MINES THE GRINDING OF THE MACHINES
1225-129526-0024 THE WREATHS OF SMOKE SCATTERED THROUGH THE AIR TRACED AROUND STONES HILL A CIRCLE OF TERROR WHICH THE HERDS OF BUFFALOES AND THE WAR PARTIES OF THE SEMINOLES NEVER VENTURED TO PASS NEVERTHELESS THE WORKS ADVANCED REGULARLY
1225-129526-0025 OF UNEXPECTED OBSTACLES THERE WAS LITTLE ACCOUNT
1225-129526-0026 THIS DEPTH WAS DOUBLED IN DECEMBER AND TREBLED IN JANUARY DURING THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY THE WORKMEN HAD TO CONTEND WITH A SHEET OF WATER WHICH MADE ITS WAY RIGHT ACROSS THE OUTER SOIL
1225-129526-0027 IT BECAME NECESSARY TO EMPLOY VERY POWERFUL PUMPS AND COMPRESSED AIR ENGINES TO DRAIN IT OFF SO AS TO CLOSE UP THE ORIFICE FROM WHENCE IT ISSUED JUST AS ONE STOPS A LEAK ON BOARD SHIP
1225-129526-0028 THE WHEEL PARTLY GAVE WAY AND A SLIGHT PARTIAL SETTLEMENT ENSUED THIS ACCIDENT COST THE LIFE OF SEVERAL WORKMEN NO FRESH OCCURRENCE THENCEFORWARD ARRESTED THE PROGRESS OF THE OPERATION
1225-129526-0029 AND ON THE TENTH OF JUNE TWENTY DAYS BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF THE PERIOD FIXED BY BARBICANE THE WELL LINED THROUGHOUT WITH ITS FACING OF STONE HAD ATTAINED THE DEPTH OF NINE HUNDRED FEET
1225-129526-0030 AT THE BOTTOM THE MASONRY RESTED UPON A MASSIVE BLOCK MEASURING THIRTY FEET IN THICKNESS WHILE ON THE UPPER PORTION IT WAS LEVEL WITH THE SURROUNDING SOIL PRESIDENT BARBICANE AND THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB WARMLY CONGRATULATED THEIR ENGINEER MURCHISON
1225-129526-0031 THE CYCLOPEAN WORK HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WITH EXTRAORDINARY RAPIDITY DURING THESE EIGHT MONTHS BARBICANE NEVER QUITTED STONES HILL FOR A SINGLE INSTANT
1225-129526-0032 HE BUSIED HIMSELF INCESSANTLY WITH THE WELFARE AND HEALTH OF HIS WORKPEOPLE AND WAS SINGULARLY FORTUNATE IN WARDING OFF THE EPIDEMICS COMMON TO LARGE COMMUNITIES OF MEN AND SO DISASTROUS IN THOSE REGIONS OF THE GLOBE WHICH ARE EXPOSED TO THE INFLUENCES OF TROPICAL CLIMATES
1225-129526-0033 MANY WORKMEN IT IS TRUE PAID WITH THEIR LIVES FOR THE RASHNESS INHERENT IN THESE DANGEROUS LABORS BUT THESE MISHAPS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO BE AVOIDED AND THEY ARE CLASSED AMONG THE DETAILS WITH WHICH THE AMERICANS TROUBLE THEMSELVES BUT LITTLE
1225-129526-0034 THEY HAVE IN FACT MORE REGARD FOR HUMAN NATURE IN GENERAL THAN FOR THE INDIVIDUAL IN PARTICULAR NEVERTHELESS BARBICANE PROFESSED OPPOSITE PRINCIPLES TO THESE AND PUT THEM IN FORCE AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY SO
1225-129526-0035 THANKS TO HIS CARE HIS INTELLIGENCE HIS USEFUL INTERVENTION IN ALL DIFFICULTIES HIS PRODIGIOUS AND HUMANE SAGACITY THE AVERAGE OF ACCIDENTS DID NOT EXCEED THAT OF TRANSATLANTIC COUNTRIES NOTED FOR THEIR EXCESSIVE PRECAUTIONS
1225-129526-0036 FRANCE FOR INSTANCE AMONG OTHERS
