4156-12159-0000 THE TWELFTH SURPRISE THE LAND OF THE CIVILIZED MONKEYS I MUST NOW TELL YOU OF A VERY STRANGE ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL PRINCE ZINGLE
4156-12159-0001 WHICH HAD IT NOT TURNED OUT EXACTLY AS IT DID MIGHT HAVE RESULTED IN MAKING HIM A CAPTIVE FOR LIFE IN A REMARKABLE COUNTRY BY CONSULTING SMITH'S HISTORY OF PRINCE ZINGLE YOU WILL NOTICE THAT FROM BOYHOOD HE HAD A GREAT PASSION FOR FLYING KITES
4156-12159-0002 AND UNLIKE OTHER BOYS HE ALWAYS UNDERTOOK TO MAKE EACH KITE LARGER THAN THE LAST ONE THEREFORE HIS KITES GREW IN SIZE AND BECAME LARGER AND LARGER UNTIL AT LENGTH THE PRINCE MADE ONE TWICE AS TALL AS HIMSELF
4156-12159-0003 WHEN IT WAS FINISHED HE WAS VERY PROUD OF THIS GREAT KITE AND TOOK IT OUT TO A LEVEL PLACE TO SEE HOW WELL IT WOULD FLY BEING ACCOMPANIED BY MANY OF THE PEOPLE OF MO WHO TOOK CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THE PRINCE'S AMUSEMENT
4156-12159-0004 ZINGLE TIED THE STRING AROUND HIS WAIST IT FLEW BEAUTIFULLY AT FIRST BUT PULLED SO HARD THE PRINCE COULD SCARCELY HOLD IT AT LAST WHEN THE STRING WAS ALL LET OUT THERE CAME A SUDDEN GUST OF WIND
4156-12159-0005 AND IN AN INSTANT POOR ZINGLE WAS DRAWN INTO THE AIR AS EASILY AS AN ORDINARY KITE DRAWS ITS TAIL UP AND UP HE SOARED AND THE KITE FOLLOWED THE WIND AND CARRIED HIM OVER MANY COUNTRIES UNTIL THE STRENGTH DIED OUT OF THE AIR
4156-12159-0006 WHEN THE KITE SLOWLY SETTLED TOWARD THE EARTH AND LANDED THE PRINCE IN THE TOP OF A TALL TREE HE NOW UNTIED THE STRING FROM HIS WAIST AND FASTENED IT TO A BRANCH OF THE TREE AS HE DID NOT WISH TO LOSE THE KITE AFTER ALL HIS BOTHER IN MAKING IT
4156-12159-0007 THEN HE BEGAN TO CLIMB DOWN TO THE GROUND BUT ON REACHING THE LOWER BRANCHES HE WAS ARRESTED BY A MOST CURIOUS SIGHT
4156-12159-0008 STANDING ON THE GROUND AND GAZING UP AT HIM WERE A DOZEN MONKEYS ALL VERY NEATLY DRESSED AND ALL EVIDENTLY FILLED WITH SURPRISE AT THE PRINCE'S SUDDEN APPEARANCE IN THE TREE WHAT A VERY QUEER ANIMAL EXCLAIMED AN OLD MONKEY
4156-12159-0009 WHO WORE A TALL SILK HAT AND HAD WHITE KID GLOVES ON HIS HANDS GOLD SPECTACLES RESTED ON HIS NOSE AND HE POINTED TOWARD THE PRINCE WITH A GOLD HEADED CANE
4156-12159-0010 AND WHEN SHE SAW ZINGLE SHE CLUNG TO THE OLD MONKEY'S HAND AND SEEMED FRIGHTENED
4156-12159-0011 OH GRANDPAPA SHE CRIED TAKE ME BACK TO MAMMA I'M AFRAID THE STRANGE BEAST WILL BITE ME JUST THEN A BIG MONKEY WEARING A BLUE COAT WITH BRASS BUTTONS AND SWINGING A SHORT CLUB IN HIS HAND STRUTTED UP TO THEM AND SAID
4156-12159-0012 DON'T BE AFRAID LITTLE ONE THE BEAST CAN'T HURT YOU WHILE I'M AROUND AND THEN HE TIPPED HIS CAP OVER HIS LEFT EAR AND SHOOK HIS CLUB AT THE PRINCE
4156-12159-0013 AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT FEAR MEANT TWO MONKEYS WHO WERE DRESSED IN RED JACKETS AND CARRIED MUSKETS IN THEIR HANDS NOW CAME RUNNING UP AND HAVING LOOKED AT ZINGLE WITH MUCH INTEREST THEY CALLED FOR SOME ONE TO BRING THEM A STRONG ROPE
4156-12159-0014 WE WILL CAPTURE THE BRUTE AND PUT HIM IN THE ZOO SAID ONE OF THE SOLDIER MONKEYS
4156-12159-0015 I DO NOT KNOW BUT SOME OF OUR COLLEGE PROFESSORS CAN DOUBTLESS TELL AND EVEN IF THEY CAN'T THEY WILL GIVE IT SOME SCIENTIFIC NAME THAT WILL SATISFY THE PEOPLE JUST AS WELL ALL THIS TIME PRINCE ZINGLE REMAINED CLINGING TO THE BRANCHES OF THE TREE
4156-12159-0016 HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND A WORD OF THE MONKEY LANGUAGE AND THEREFORE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT
4156-12159-0017 WHEN THEY BROUGHT A LONG AND STOUT ROPE AND PREPARED TO THROW ONE END OF IT OVER HIS HEAD IN ORDER TO CAPTURE HIM HE BECAME ANGRY AND CALLED OUT TO THEM STOP I COMMAND YOU WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS STRANGE CONDUCT I AM PRINCE ZINGLE ELDEST SON OF THE MONARCH OF MO
4156-12159-0018 BUT THIS SPEECH HAD NO MEANING IN THE EARS OF THE MONKEYS WHO SAID TO EACH OTHER HEAR HIM BARK HE JABBERS AWAY ALMOST AS IF HE COULD TALK BY THIS TIME A LARGE CROWD OF MONKEYS HAD SURROUNDED THE TREE
4156-12159-0019 SOME BEING BAREFOOTED BOY MONKEYS AND SOME LADY MONKEYS DRESSED IN SILKEN GOWNS AND GORGEOUS RAIMENT OF THE LATEST MODE AND OTHERS MEN MONKEYS OF ALL SORTS AND CONDITIONS THERE WERE DANDIFIED MONKEYS AND SOBER LOOKING BUSINESS MONKEYS
4156-12159-0020 AS WELL AS SEVERAL WHO APPEARED TO BE POLITICIANS AND OFFICIALS OF HIGH DEGREE STAND BACK ALL OF YOU SHOUTED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS WE'RE GOING TO CAPTURE THIS REMARKABLE BEAST FOR THE ROYAL MENAGERIE AND UNLESS YOU STAND OUT OF THE WAY HE MAY SHOW FIGHT AND BITE SOME ONE
4156-12159-0021 SO THEY MOVED BACK TO A SAFE DISTANCE AND THE SOLDIER MONKEY PREPARED TO THROW A ROPE STOP CRIED ZINGLE AGAIN DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A THIEF THAT YOU TRY TO BIND ME I AM A PRINCE OF THE ROYAL BLOOD
4156-12159-0022 AND UNLESS YOU TREAT ME RESPECTFULLY I SHALL HAVE MY FATHER THE KING MARCH HIS ARMY ON YOU AND DESTROY YOUR WHOLE COUNTRY
4156-12159-0023 THE NEXT MOMENT HE THREW THE ROPE AND CAUGHT POOR ZINGLE AROUND HIS ARMS AND BODY SO THAT HE WAS HELPLESS THEN THE SOLDIER MONKEY PULLED HARD ON THE ROPE AND PRINCE ZINGLE FELL OUT OF THE TREE TO THE GROUND
4156-12159-0024 AT FIRST THE MONKEYS ALL PRESSED BACKWARD AS IF FRIGHTENED BUT THEIR SOLDIERS CRIED OUT WE'VE GOT HIM HE CAN'T BITE NOW THEN ONE OF THEM APPROACHED THE PRINCE AND PUNCHED HIM WITH A STICK SAYING STAND UP
4156-12159-0025 ZINGLE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE WORDS BUT HE RESENTED BEING PRODDED WITH THE STICK SO HE SPRANG UP AND RUSHED ON THE SOLDIER KICKING THE STICK FROM HIS HANDS HIS OWN ARMS BEING BOUND BY THE ROPE
4156-12159-0026 THE MONKEYS SCREAMED AND RUSHED IN EVERY DIRECTION BUT THE OTHER SOLDIER CAME BEHIND THE PRINCE AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN WITH THE BUTT OF HIS GUN
4156-12159-0027 THEN HE TIED HIS LEGS WITH ANOTHER ROPE AND SEEING HIM THUS BOUND THE CROWD OF MONKEYS WHICH HAD SCATTERED AND FALLEN OVER ONE ANOTHER IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ESCAPE CAME CREEPING TIMIDLY BACK AND LOOKED ON HIM WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING
4156-12159-0028 WE'VE SUBDUED HIM AT LAST REMARKED THE SOLDIER WHO HAD BEEN KICKED BUT HE'S A VERY FIERCE ANIMAL AND I SHALL TAKE HIM TO THE ZOO AND LOCK HIM IN ONE OF THE STRONGEST CAGES SO THEY LED POOR ZINGLE AWAY TO WHERE THE ROYAL ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS WERE LOCATED
4156-12159-0029 AND THERE THEY PUT HIM INTO A BIG CAGE WITH IRON BARS THE DOOR BEING FASTENED WITH TWO GREAT PADLOCKS BEFORE VERY LONG EVERY MONKEY IN THE COUNTRY LEARNED THAT A STRANGE BEAST HAD BEEN CAPTURED AND BROUGHT TO THE ZOO
4156-12159-0030 AND SOON A LARGE CROWD HAD GATHERED BEFORE ZINGLE'S CAGE TO EXAMINE HIM ISN'T HE SWEET SAID A LADY MONKEY WHO HELD A GREEN PARASOL OVER HER HEAD AND WORE A PURPLE VEIL ON HER FACE SWEET
4156-12159-0031 GRUNTED A MAN MONKEY STANDING BESIDE HER HE'S THE UGLIEST LOOKING BRUTE I EVER SAW SCARCELY HAS ANY HAIR ON HIM AT ALL AND NO TAIL AND VERY LITTLE CHIN I WONDER WHERE ON EARTH THE CREATURE CAME FROM
4156-12159-0032 IT MAY BE ONE OF THOSE BEINGS FROM WHOM OUR RACE IS DESCENDED SAID ANOTHER ONLOOKER THE PROFESSORS SAY WE EVOLVED FROM SOME PRIMITIVE CREATURE OF THIS SORT HEAVEN FORBID
4156-12159-0033 CRIED A DANDY MONKEY WHOSE COLLAR WAS SO HIGH THAT IT KEPT TIPPING HIS HAT OVER HIS EYES IF I THOUGHT SUCH A CREATURE AS THAT WAS ONE OF MY FOREFATHERS I SHOULD COMMIT SUICIDE AT ONCE
4156-12159-0034 ZINGLE HAD BEEN SITTING ON THE FLOOR OF HIS CAGE AND WONDERING WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF HIM IN THIS STRANGE COUNTRY OF MONKEYS AND NOW TO SHOW HIS AUTHORITY ONE OF THE KEEPERS TOOK A LONG STICK AND BEGAN TO POKE THE PRINCE TO MAKE HIM STAND UP
4156-12159-0035 STOP THAT SHOUTED THE ANGRY CAPTIVE
4156-12159-0036 ALL THE LADY MONKEYS SCREAMED AT THIS AND THE MEN MONKEYS EXCLAIMED
4156-12159-0037 THE CHILDREN MONKEYS BEGAN TO THROW PEANUTS BETWEEN THE BARS OF THE CAGE AND ZINGLE WHO HAD NOW BECOME VERY HUNGRY PICKED THEM UP AND ATE THEM THIS ACT SO PLEASED THE LITTLE MONKEYS THAT THEY SHOUTED WITH LAUGHTER
4156-12159-0038 AT LAST TWO SOLEMN LOOKING MONKEYS WITH GRAY HAIR AND WEARING LONG BLACK COATS AND WHITE NECKTIES CAME UP TO THE CAGE WHERE THEY WERE GREETED WITH MUCH RESPECT BY THE OTHER MONKEYS
4156-12159-0039 SAID ONE OF THE NEW COMERS PUTTING ON HIS SPECTACLES AND LOOKING SHARPLY AT THE CAPTIVE DO YOU RECOGNIZE THE SPECIES PROFESSOR
4156-12159-0040 NOT KNOWING WHAT HE SAID NONE OF THE MONKEYS PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THIS QUESTION
4156-12159-0041 INDEED THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT HE MAY TURN OUT TO BE THE MISSING LINK
4156-12159-0042 THE MONKEYS THREW SEVERAL COCOANUTS INTO THE CAGE BUT THE PRISONER DID NOT KNOW WHAT KIND OF FRUIT THESE WERE SO AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO BITE THE HARD SHELL HE DECIDED THEY WERE NOT GOOD TO EAT DAY AFTER DAY NOW PASSED AWAY
4156-12159-0043 AND ALTHOUGH CROWDS OF MONKEYS CAME TO EXAMINE ZINGLE IN HIS CAGE THE POOR PRINCE GREW VERY PALE AND THIN FOR LACK OF PROPER FOOD WHILE THE CONTINUANCE OF HIS UNHAPPY IMPRISONMENT MADE HIM SAD AND MELANCHOLY
4156-12159-0044 COULD I BUT ESCAPE AND FIND MY WAY BACK TO MY FATHER'S VALLEY HE MOANED WEARILY
4156-12159-0045 AND POKED HIM WITH LONG STICKS HAVING SHARP POINTS SO THAT THE PRINCE'S LIFE BECAME ONE OF GREAT MISERY AT THE END OF ABOUT TWO WEEKS A HAPPY RELIEF CAME TO ZINGLE FOR THEN A BABY HIPPOPOTAMUS WAS CAPTURED AND BROUGHT TO THE ROYAL ZOO
4156-12159-0046 AND AFTER THIS THE MONKEYS LEFT THE PRINCE'S CAGE AND CROWDED AROUND THAT OF THE NEW ARRIVAL FINDING HIMSELF THUS DESERTED PRINCE ZINGLE BEGAN TO SEEK A MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM HIS CONFINEMENT HIS FIRST ATTEMPT WAS TO BREAK THE IRON BARS
4156-12159-0047 THEN HE SHOOK THE DOOR WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH BUT THE BIG PADLOCKS HELD FIRM AND COULD NOT BE BROKEN THEN THE PRISONER GAVE WAY TO DESPAIR AND THREW HIMSELF ON THE FLOOR OF THE CAGE WEEPING BITTERLY
4156-12159-0048 SUDDENLY HE HEARD A GREAT SHOUT FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE CAGE WHERE THE BABY HIPPOPOTAMUS WAS CONFINED AND RISING TO HIS FEET THE PRINCE WALKED TO THE BARS AND ATTEMPTED TO LOOK OUT AND DISCOVER WHAT WAS CAUSING THE EXCITEMENT
4156-12159-0049 TO HIS ASTONISHMENT HE FOUND HE WAS ABLE TO THRUST HIS HEAD BETWEEN TWO OF THE IRON BARS HAVING GROWN SO THIN THROUGH HUNGER AND ABUSE THAT HE WAS MUCH SMALLER THAN WHEN THE MONKEYS HAD FIRST CAPTURED HIM
4156-12159-0050 HE REALIZED AT ONCE THAT IF HIS HEAD WOULD PASS BETWEEN THE BARS HIS BODY COULD BE MADE TO DO SO LIKEWISE SO HE STRUGGLED BRAVELY AND AT LAST SUCCEEDED IN SQUEEZING HIS BODY BETWEEN THE BARS AND LEAPING SAFELY TO THE GROUND
4156-12159-0051 FINDING HIMSELF AT LIBERTY THE PRINCE LOST NO TIME IN RUNNING TO THE TREE WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIS KITE BUT ON THE WAY SOME OF THE BOY MONKEYS DISCOVERED HIM AND RAISED A GREAT CRY WHICH SOON BROUGHT HUNDREDS OF HIS ENEMIES IN PURSUIT
4156-12159-0052 ZINGLE HAD A GOOD START HOWEVER AND SOON REACHED THE TREE QUICKLY HE CLIMBED UP THE TRUNK AND BRANCHES UNTIL HE HAD GAINED THE LIMB WHERE THE STRING OF HIS KITE WAS STILL FASTENED UNTYING THE CORD HE WOUND IT AROUND HIS WAIST SEVERAL TIMES
4156-12159-0053 AND THEN FINDING A STRONG NORTH WIND BLOWING HE SKILFULLY TOSSED THE KITE INTO THE AIR AT ONCE IT FILLED AND MOUNTED TO THE SKY LIFTING ZINGLE FROM THE TREE AND CARRYING HIM WITH PERFECT EASE
4156-12159-0054 IT WAS FORTUNATE HE GOT AWAY AT THAT MOMENT FOR SEVERAL OF THE MONKEYS HAD SCRAMBLED UP THE TREE AFTER HIM AND WERE ALMOST NEAR ENOUGH TO SEIZE HIM BY THE LEGS WHEN TO THEIR SURPRISE HE SHOT INTO THE AIR
4156-12159-0055 INDEED SO AMAZED WERE THEY BY THIS REMARKABLE ESCAPE OF THEIR PRISONER THAT THE MONKEYS REMAINED STARING INTO THE AIR UNTIL PRINCE ZINGLE HAD BECOME A LITTLE SPECK IN THE SKY ABOVE THEM AND FINALLY DISAPPEARED
4156-12159-0056 THAT WAS THE LAST OUR PRINCE EVER SAW OF THE STRANGE COUNTRY OF THE MONKEYS FOR THE WIND CARRIED HIS KITE STRAIGHT BACK TO THE VALLEY OF MO WHEN ZINGLE FOUND HIMSELF ABOVE HIS FATHER'S PALACE HE TOOK OUT HIS POCKET KNIFE AND CUT THE STRING OF THE KITE
4156-12159-0057 AND IMMEDIATELY FELL HEAD FOREMOST INTO A POND OF CUSTARD THAT LAY IN THE BACK YARD WHERE HE DIVED THROUGH A FLOATING ISLAND OF WHIPPED CREAM AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW
4156-12159-0058 AND HE RAN TO TELL THE KING THAT A NEW METEOR HAD FALLEN AND RUINED ONE OF HIS FLOATING ISLANDS THEREUPON THE MONARCH AND SEVERAL OF HIS COURTIERS RUSHED OUT AND FOUND PRINCE ZINGLE SWIMMING ASHORE
4156-12159-0059 AND THE KING WAS SO DELIGHTED AT SEEING HIS LOST SON AGAIN THAT HE CLASPED HIM JOYFULLY IN HIS ARMS THE NEXT MOMENT HE REGRETTED THIS ACT
4156-12159-0060 AND THEN THERE WAS MUCH REJOICING THROUGHOUT THE LAND OF COURSE THE FIRST THING ZINGLE ASKED FOR WAS SOMETHING TO EAT AND BEFORE LONG HE WAS SITTING AT A TABLE HEAPED WITH ALL SORTS OF GOOD THINGS PLUCKED FRESH FROM THE TREES
4156-12159-0061 THE PEOPLE CROWDED AROUND HIM DEMANDING THE TALE OF HIS ADVENTURES AND THEIR SURPRISE WAS ONLY EQUALED BY THEIR HORROR WHEN THEY LEARNED HE HAD BEEN CAPTURED BY A BAND OF MONKEYS AND SHUT UP IN A CAGE BECAUSE HE WAS THOUGHT TO BE A DANGEROUS WILD BEAST
4156-12159-0062 EXPERIENCE IS SAID TO BE AN EXCELLENT TEACHER ALTHOUGH A VERY CRUEL ONE
