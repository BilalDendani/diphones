8142-3967-0000 LOCAL GOVERNORS WHO HAD BECOME RICH AND HAVING RETURNED FROM DIFFERENT PROVINCES SOUNDED THE PRINCESS TO SEE IF SHE WERE INCLINED TO PART WITH HER RESIDENCE BUT THIS SHE ALWAYS REFUSED TO DO SAYING THAT HOWEVER UNFORTUNATE SHE MIGHT BE
8142-3967-0001 BUT SUCH PEOPLE APPEARED ONLY CONTEMPTIBLE TO HER AS SHE LOOKED UPON THEM AS PROPOSING SUCH A THING SOLELY BECAUSE THEY KNEW SHE WAS POOR HER ATTENDANTS SOMETIMES SUGGESTED TO HER THAT IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN UNCOMMON OCCURRENCE FOR ONE TO DISPOSE OF SUCH ARTICLES
8142-3967-0002 ALLOWING THEM TO BECOME THE ORNAMENT OF THE DWELLINGS OF SOME LOWBORN UPSTARTS SCARCELY ANYONE PAID A VISIT TO HER DWELLING HER ONLY OCCASIONAL VISITOR BEING HER BROTHER A PRIEST WHO CAME TO SEE HER WHEN HE CAME TO THE CAPITAL
8142-3967-0003 BUT HE WAS A MAN OF ECCENTRIC CHARACTER AND WAS NOT VERY FLOURISHING IN HIS CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH BEING THE STATE OF AFFAIRS WITH THE PRINCESS HITACHI THE GROUNDS OF HER MANSION BECAME MORE AND MORE DESOLATE AND WILD
8142-3967-0004 AND CARRIED AWAY PART OF THE SHINGLE ROOF ONLY ONE BLESSING REMAINED THERE NO THIEF INTRUDED INTO THE ENCLOSURE AS NO TEMPTATION WAS OFFERED TO THEM FOR THEIR ATTACK BUT NEVER DID THE PRINCESS LOSE HER ACCUSTOMED RESERVE
8142-3967-0005 THESE WITH THEIR ILLUSTRATIONS WERE HER CHIEF RESOURCES NOW A SISTER OF THE PRINCESS'S MOTHER HAD MARRIED A DURIO AND HAD ALREADY BORNE HIM A DAUGHTER THIS MARRIAGE HAD BEEN CONSIDERED AN UNEQUAL MATCH BY THE FATHER OF THE PRINCESS
8142-3967-0006 AND FOR THIS REASON SHE WAS NOT VERY FRIENDLY WITH THE FAMILY
8142-3967-0007 AND WHO STILL REMAINED WITH THE PRINCESS USED TO GO TO HER
8142-3967-0008 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHERE A LADY OF ORDINARY DEGREE IS ELEVATED TO A HIGHER POSITION
8142-3967-0009 BUT THERE ARE OTHER WOMEN WHO WHEN DEGRADED FROM THEIR RANK SPOIL THEIR TASTE AND HABITS JUST LIKE THE LADY IN QUESTION
8142-3967-0010 SENIOR SECRETARY TO THE LORD LIEUTENANT AND THEY WERE TO GO DOWN TO TZKUSHI
8142-3967-0011 BUT THE PRINCESS STILL CLUNG TO THE HOPE THAT THE TIME WOULD COME WHEN GENJI WOULD REMEMBER HER AND RENEW HIS KINDNESS WINTER CAME ONE DAY QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY THE AUNT ARRIVED AT THE MANSION BRINGING AS A PRESENT A DRESS FOR THE PRINCESS
8142-3967-0012 HER CARRIAGE DASHED INTO THE GARDEN IN A MOST POMPOUS STYLE AND DROVE RIGHT UP TO THE SOUTHERN FRONT OF THE BUILDING JIJIU WENT TO MEET HER AND CONDUCTED HER INTO THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENT I MUST SOON BE LEAVING THE CAPITAL SAID THE VISITOR
8142-3967-0013 IT IS NOT MY WISH TO LEAVE YOU BEHIND BUT YOU WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ME AND NOW THERE IS NO HELP BUT THIS ONE THIS JIJIU AT LEAST I WISH TO TAKE WITH ME I HAVE COME TO DAY TO FETCH HER I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN BE CONTENT WITH YOUR PRESENT CONDITION
8142-3967-0014 HERE SHE MANIFESTED A CERTAIN SADNESS BUT HER DELIGHT AT HER HUSBAND'S PROMOTION WAS UNMISTAKABLE AND SHE CONTINUED WHEN YOUR FATHER WAS ALIVE I WAS LOOKED DOWN UPON BY HIM WHICH CAUSED A COOLNESS BETWEEN US
8142-3967-0015 WHICH MADE ME ABSTAIN FROM VISITING YOU OFTEN BUT FORTUNE IS FICKLE FOR THOSE IN A HUMBLE POSITION OFTEN ENJOY COMFORT AND THOSE THAT ARE HIGHER IN STATION ARE NOT QUITE SO WELL CIRCUMSTANCED I DO REALLY FEEL SORRY TO LEAVE YOU BEHIND
8142-3967-0016 BUT IT IS SIMPLY FOOLISH TO ABANDON ONE'S SELF AND TO BURY ONE'S LIFE UNDER SUCH A MASS OF DILAPIDATION
8142-3967-0017 ALL HIS OLD FAVORITES BEING NOW ABANDONED HOW THEN CAN YOU EXPECT HIM TO SAY THAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN FAITHFUL TO HIM
8142-3967-0018 THESE WORDS TOUCHED THE PRINCESS BUT SHE GAVE NO VENT TO HER FEELINGS THE VISITOR THEREFORE HURRIED JIJIU TO GET READY SAYING THAT THEY MUST LEAVE BEFORE THE DUSK
8142-3967-0019 THAT ALSO SEEMS NATURAL
8142-3967-0020 MADE OF THE HAIR WHICH HAD FALLEN FROM HER OWN HEAD THIS SHE PUT INTO AN OLD CASKET
8142-3967-0021 WAS VERY TRYING TO THE PRINCESS WHO SAID TO HER THAT THOUGH SHE COULD NOT BLAME HER FOR LEAVING SHE STILL FELT SORRY TO LOSE HER TO THIS JIJIU REPLIED THAT SHE NEVER FORGOT THE WISHES OF HER MOTHER AND WAS ONLY TOO HAPPY TO SHARE JOY AND SORROW WITH THE PRINCESS
8142-3967-0022 YET SHE WAS SORRY TO SAY THAT CIRCUMSTANCES OBLIGED HER TO LEAVE HER FOR SOME TIME BUT BEFORE SHE COULD SAY MUCH SHE WAS HURRIED AWAY BY THE VISITOR IT WAS ONE EVENING IN APRIL OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR THAT GENJI HAPPENED TO BE GOING TO THE VILLA OF THE FALLING FLOWERS
8142-3967-0023 KOREMITZ ENTERED AND PROCEEDING TO THE DOOR CALLED OUT
8142-3967-0024 KOREMITZ RECOGNIZED HER AS AN AUNT OF THE LATTER HE THEN ASKED HER ABOUT THE PRINCESS AND TOLD HER OF GENJI'S INTENTION TO HIS INQUIRIES HE SOON OBTAINED A SATISFACTORY ANSWER
8142-3967-0025 AND DULY REPORTED IT TO GENJI WHO NOW FELT A PANG OF REMORSE FOR HIS LONG NEGLIGENCE OF ONE SO BADLY CIRCUMSTANCED HE DESCENDED FROM HIS CARRIAGE BUT THE PATHWAY WAS ALL BUT OVERGROWN WITH TALL MUGWORT WHICH WAS WET WITH A PASSING SHOWER
8142-3967-0026 ONLY I HEARD NOTHING FROM YOU SO I WAITED TILL NOW AND HERE I FIND MYSELF ONCE MORE THE PRINCESS AS USUAL SAID VERY LITTLE ONLY THANKING HIM FOR HIS VISIT HE THEN ADDRESSED HER IN MANY KIND AND AFFECTIONATE WORDS
8142-3967-0027 WHO WAS BY NO MEANS DISTINGUISHED FOR HER BEAUTY AND WHO STILL BORE A MARK ON HER NOSE WHICH MIGHT REMIND ONE OF A WELL RIPENED FRUIT CARRIED BY MOUNTAINEERS HOW WAS THIS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PREORDAINED TO BE SO
8142-3967-0028 I WOULD FAIN DESCRIBE THE ASTONISHMENT OF HER AUNT WHEN SHE RETURNED FROM THE WESTERN ISLAND AND SAW THE PRINCESS'S HAPPY CONDITION AND HOW JIJIU REGRETTED HAVING LEFT HER TOO HASTILY
