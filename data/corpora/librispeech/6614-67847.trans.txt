6614-67847-0035 SO THAT SYLVIA WAS NOT QUESTIONED THAT NIGHT IN REGARD TO HER DISAPPEARANCE FROM MISS PATTEN'S GRACE KNEW NOTHING OF SYLVIA'S ENCOUNTER WITH ELINOR MAYHEW SO NO ONE COULD IMAGINE WHY SHE HAD STARTED FOR HOME WITHOUT A WORD TO MISS PATTEN
6614-67847-0036 MISSUS FULTON WAS TOO REJOICED TO HAVE HER LITTLE GIRL SAFELY AT HOME TO QUESTION OR BLAME HER SYLVIA WAS NOT HUNGRY THE OFFICER IN CHARGE OF FORT SUMTER HAD GIVEN THE TWO CHILDREN AN EXCELLENT SUPPER
