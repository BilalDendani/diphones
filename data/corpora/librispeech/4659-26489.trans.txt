4659-26489-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE HOW DAVID FLED TO AHIMELECH AND AFTERWARDS TO THE KINGS OF THE PHILISTINES AND OF THE MOABITES
4659-26489-0001 AND CAME TO THE CITY NOB TO AHIMELECH THE PRIEST WHO WHEN HE SAW HIM COMING ALL ALONE AND NEITHER A FRIEND NOR A SERVANT WITH HIM HE WONDERED AT IT AND DESIRED TO LEARN OF HIM THE CAUSE WHY THERE WAS NOBODY WITH HIM TO WHICH DAVID ANSWERED
4659-26489-0002 THAT THE KING HAD COMMANDED HIM TO DO A CERTAIN THING THAT WAS TO BE KEPT SECRET TO WHICH IF HE HAD A MIND TO KNOW SO MUCH HE HAD NO OCCASION FOR ANY ONE TO ACCOMPANY HIM HOWEVER I HAVE ORDERED MY SERVANTS TO MEET ME AT SUCH AND SUCH A PLACE SO HE DESIRED HIM TO LET HIM HAVE SOMEWHAT TO EAT
4659-26489-0003 HE FLED OUT OF THE COUNTRY OF THE HEBREWS INTO THAT OF THE PHILISTINES OVER WHICH ACHISH REIGNED AND WHEN THE KING'S SERVANTS KNEW HIM AND HE WAS MADE KNOWN TO THE KING HIMSELF THE SERVANTS INFORMING HIM THAT HE WAS THAT DAVID WHO HAD KILLED MANY TEN THOUSANDS OF THE PHILISTINES
4659-26489-0004 WHICH MIGHT MAKE HIM BELIEVE THAT THEY PROCEEDED FROM SUCH A DISTEMPER ACCORDINGLY THE KING WAS VERY ANGRY AT HIS SERVANTS THAT THEY HAD BROUGHT HIM A MADMAN
4659-26489-0005 HE CAME TO THE TRIBE OF JUDAH AND ABODE IN A CAVE BY THE CITY OF ADULLAM THEN IT WAS THAT HE SENT TO HIS BRETHREN AND INFORMED THEM WHERE HE WAS WHO THEN CAME TO HIM WITH ALL THEIR KINDRED AND AS MANY OTHERS AS WERE EITHER IN WANT OR IN FEAR OF KING SAUL
4659-26489-0006 CAME AND MADE A BODY TOGETHER AND TOLD HIM THEY WERE READY TO OBEY HIS ORDERS THEY WERE IN ALL ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED WHEREUPON HE TOOK COURAGE NOW SUCH A FORCE AND ASSISTANCE WAS COME TO HIM SO HE REMOVED THENCE AND CAME TO THE KING OF THE MOABITES
4659-26489-0007 UPON THE PROPHET'S COMMANDING HIM TO LEAVE THE DESERT
4659-26489-0008 YOU THAT ARE MEN OF MY OWN TRIBE I CONCLUDE THAT YOU REMEMBER THE BENEFITS THAT I HAVE BESTOWED UPON YOU AND THAT I HAVE MADE SOME OF YOU OWNERS OF LAND AND MADE YOU COMMANDERS AND BESTOWED POSTS OF HONOR UPON YOU
4659-26489-0009 AND SET SOME OF YOU OVER THE COMMON PEOPLE AND OTHERS OVER THE SOLDIERS I ASK YOU THEREFORE WHETHER YOU EXPECT GREATER AND MORE DONATIONS FROM THE SON OF JESSE FOR I KNOW THAT YOU ARE ALL INCLINABLE TO HIM
4659-26489-0010 EVEN MY OWN SON JONATHAN HIMSELF IS OF THAT OPINION AND PERSUADES YOU TO BE OF THE SAME FOR I AM NOT UNACQUAINTED WITH THE OATHS AND THE COVENANTS THAT ARE BETWEEN HIM AND DAVID AND THAT JONATHAN IS A COUNSELOR AND AN ASSISTANT TO THOSE THAT CONSPIRE AGAINST ME
4659-26489-0011 AND NONE OF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THESE THINGS BUT YOU KEEP SILENCE AND WATCH TO SEE WHAT WILL BE THE UPSHOT OF THESE THINGS WHEN THE KING HAD MADE THIS SPEECH NOT ONE OF THE REST OF THOSE THAT WERE PRESENT MADE ANY ANSWER BUT DOEG THE SYRIAN WHO FED HIS MULES
4659-26489-0012 AND FOR ALL HIS KINDRED AND SAID TO THEM WHAT TERRIBLE OR UNGRATEFUL TIRING HAST THOU SUFFERED FROM ME THAT THOU HAST RECEIVED THE SON OF JESSE AND HAST BESTOWED ON HIM BOTH FOOD AND WEAPONS WHEN HE WAS CONTRIVING TO GET THE KINGDOM AND FURTHER
4659-26489-0013 AND WHAT IS MORE THAN THESE THY SON IN LAW AND KINSMAN MEN DO NOT CHOOSE TO CONFER SUCH FAVORS ON THEIR ADVERSARIES BUT ON THOSE WHO ARE ESTEEMED TO BEAR THE HIGHEST GOOD WILL AND RESPECT TO THEM NOR IS THIS THE FIRST TIME THAT I PROPHESIED FOR HIM
4659-26489-0014 WHEREFORE DO NOT THOU ENTERTAIN ANY ILL OPINION OF ME NOR DO THOU HAVE A SUSPICION OF WHAT I THEN THOUGHT AN ACT OF HUMANITY FROM WHAT IS NOW TOLD THEE OF DAVID'S ATTEMPTS AGAINST THEE FOR I DID THEN TO HIM AS TO THY FRIEND AND SON IN LAW AND CAPTAIN OF A THOUSAND
4659-26489-0015 HIS FEAR WAS SO PREVALENT THAT HE COULD NOT GIVE CREDIT TO AN APOLOGY THAT WAS VERY JUST SO HE COMMANDED HIS ARMED MEN THAT STOOD ABOUT HIM TO KILL HIM AND ALL HIS KINDRED BUT AS THEY DURST NOT TOUCH THE HIGH PRIEST BUT WERE MORE AFRAID OF DISOBEYING GOD THAN THE KING
4659-26489-0016 HE ORDERED DOEG THE SYRIAN TO KILL THEM ACCORDINGLY HE TOOK TO HIS ASSISTANCE SUCH WICKED MEN AS WERE LIKE HIMSELF AND SLEW AHIMELECH AND ALL HIS FAMILY WHO WERE IN ALL THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE
4659-26489-0017 AND SLEW ALL THAT WERE THERE WITHOUT SPARING EITHER WOMEN OR CHILDREN OR ANY OTHER AGE AND BURNT IT ONLY THERE WAS ONE SON OF AHIMELECH
4659-26489-0018 HOWEVER THESE THINGS CAME TO PASS AS GOD HAD FORETOLD TO ELI THE HIGH PRIEST WHEN HE SAID THAT HIS POSTERITY SHOULD BE DESTROYED
4659-26489-0019 BY PERPETRATING SO BARBAROUS A CRIME AND MURDERING THE WHOLE FAMILY OF THE HIGH PRIESTLY DIGNITY BY HAVING NO PITY OF THE INFANTS NOR REVERENCE FOR THE AGED AND BY OVERTHROWING THE CITY WHICH GOD HAD CHOSEN FOR THE PROPERTY
4659-26489-0020 AND FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE PRIESTS AND PROPHETS WHICH WERE THERE AND HAD ORDAINED AS THE ONLY CITY ALLOTTED FOR THE EDUCATION OF SUCH MEN GIVES ALL TO UNDERSTAND AND CONSIDER THE DISPOSITION OF MEN THAT WHILE THEY ARE PRIVATE PERSONS AND IN A LOW CONDITION
4659-26489-0021 BECAUSE IT IS NOT IN THEIR POWER TO INDULGE NATURE NOR TO VENTURE UPON WHAT THEY WISH FOR THEY ARE EQUITABLE AND MODERATE AND PURSUE NOTHING BUT WHAT IS JUST AND BEND THEIR WHOLE MINDS AND LABORS THAT WAY THEN IT IS THAT THEY HAVE THIS BELIEF ABOUT GOD
4659-26489-0022 AND FIRM AND TRUE AND PLEASING BOTH TO MEN AND TO GOD BUT AS TO WHAT WILL COME HEREAFTER THEY HAVE NOT THE LEAST REGARD TO IT THEY RAISE THOSE TO HONOR INDEED WHO HAVE BEEN AT A GREAT DEAL OF PAINS FOR THEM AND AFTER THAT HONOR THEY ENVY THEM
4659-26489-0023 THEY ALSO PUNISH MEN FOR THEIR ACTIONS NOT SUCH AS DESERVE CONDEMNATION BUT FROM CALUMNIES AND ACCUSATIONS WITHOUT EXAMINATION AND THIS EXTENDS NOT ONLY TO SUCH AS DESERVE TO BE PUNISHED BUT TO AS MANY AS THEY ARE ABLE TO KILL
