1222-133834-0000 CHAPTER SIX THE STARLIGHT THE SUNDAY WAS A BRIGHT SUNDAY IN AUTUMN CLEAR AND COOL WHEN EARLY IN THE MORNING SISSY AND RACHAEL MET TO WALK IN THE COUNTRY AS COKETOWN CAST ASHES NOT ONLY ON ITS OWN HEAD
1222-133834-0001 BUT ON THE NEIGHBOURHOODS TOOAFTER THE MANNER OF THOSE PIOUS PERSONS WHO DO PENANCE FOR THEIR OWN SINS BY PUTTING OTHER PEOPLE INTO SACKCLOTHIT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR THOSE WHO NOW AND THEN THIRSTED FOR A DRAUGHT OF PURE AIR WHICH IS NOT ABSOLUTELY THE MOST WICKED AMONG THE VANITIES OF LIFE
1222-133834-0002 THOUGH THE GREEN LANDSCAPE WAS BLOTTED HERE AND THERE WITH HEAPS OF COAL IT WAS GREEN ELSEWHERE AND THERE WERE TREES TO SEE AND THERE WERE LARKS SINGING THOUGH IT WAS SUNDAY AND THERE WERE PLEASANT SCENTS IN THE AIR AND ALL WAS OVER ARCHED BY A BRIGHT BLUE SKY
1222-133834-0003 IN THE DISTANCE ONE WAY COKETOWN SHOWED AS A BLACK MIST IN ANOTHER DISTANCE HILLS BEGAN TO RISE IN A THIRD THERE WAS A FAINT CHANGE IN THE LIGHT OF THE HORIZON WHERE IT SHONE UPON THE FAR OFF SEA UNDER THEIR FEET
1222-133834-0004 THE GRASS WAS FRESH BEAUTIFUL SHADOWS OF BRANCHES FLICKERED UPON IT AND SPECKLED IT HEDGEROWS WERE LUXURIANT EVERYTHING WAS AT PEACE ENGINES AT PITS MOUTHS AND LEAN OLD HORSES THAT HAD WORN THE CIRCLE OF THEIR DAILY LABOUR INTO THE GROUND WERE ALIKE QUIET
1222-133834-0005 WHEELS HAD CEASED FOR A SHORT SPACE TO TURN AND THE GREAT WHEEL OF EARTH SEEMED TO REVOLVE WITHOUT THE SHOCKS AND NOISES OF ANOTHER TIME THEY WALKED ON ACROSS THE FIELDS AND DOWN THE SHADY LANES
1222-133834-0006 SOMETIMES GETTING OVER A FRAGMENT OF A FENCE SO ROTTEN THAT IT DROPPED AT A TOUCH OF THE FOOT SOMETIMES PASSING NEAR A WRECK OF BRICKS AND BEAMS OVERGROWN WITH GRASS MARKING THE SITE OF DESERTED WORKS THEY FOLLOWED PATHS AND TRACKS HOWEVER SLIGHT
1222-133834-0007 THE SUN WAS HIGH WHEN THEY SAT DOWN TO REST THEY HAD SEEN NO ONE NEAR OR DISTANT FOR A LONG TIME AND THE SOLITUDE REMAINED UNBROKEN IT IS SO STILL HERE RACHAEL AND THE WAY IS SO UNTRODDEN
1222-133834-0008 THAT I THINK WE MUST BE THE FIRST WHO HAVE BEEN HERE ALL THE SUMMER AS SISSY SAID IT HER EYES WERE ATTRACTED BY ANOTHER OF THOSE ROTTEN FRAGMENTS OF FENCE UPON THE GROUND SHE GOT UP TO LOOK AT IT AND YET I DONT KNOW
1222-133834-0009 HERE ARE FOOTSTEPS TOO O RACHAEL SHE RAN BACK AND CAUGHT HER ROUND THE NECK RACHAEL HAD ALREADY STARTED UP WHAT IS THE MATTER I DONT KNOW THERE IS A HAT LYING IN THE GRASS THEY WENT FORWARD TOGETHER
1222-133834-0010 HAT ANY BLOOD UPON IT SISSY FALTERED THEY WERE AFRAID TO LOOK BUT THEY DID EXAMINE IT
1222-133834-0011 SHE HAD UNCLASPED HER HAND AND WAS IN THE ACT OF STEPPING FORWARD WHEN RACHAEL CAUGHT HER IN BOTH ARMS WITH A SCREAM THAT RESOUNDED OVER THE WIDE LANDSCAPE BEFORE THEM AT THEIR VERY FEET
1222-133834-0012 THEY SPRANG BACK AND FELL UPON THEIR KNEES EACH HIDING HER FACE UPON THE OTHERS NECK
1222-133834-0013 AT FIRST THIS AND HER TERRIFIC SCREAMS WERE ALL THAT COULD BE GOT FROM RACHAEL BY ANY TEARS BY ANY PRAYERS BY ANY REPRESENTATIONS BY ANY MEANS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HUSH HER AND IT WAS DEADLY NECESSARY TO HOLD HER
1222-133834-0014 RACHAEL DEAR RACHAEL GOOD RACHAEL FOR THE LOVE OF HEAVEN NOT THESE DREADFUL CRIES THINK OF STEPHEN THINK OF STEPHEN THINK OF STEPHEN BY AN EARNEST REPETITION OF THIS ENTREATY POURED OUT IN ALL THE AGONY OF SUCH A MOMENT SISSY AT LAST BROUGHT HER TO BE SILENT
1222-133834-0015 AND TO LOOK AT HER WITH A TEARLESS FACE OF STONE RACHAEL STEPHEN MAY BE LIVING YOU WOULDNT LEAVE HIM LYING MAIMED AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS DREADFUL PLACE A MOMENT IF YOU COULD BRING HELP TO HIM NO NO NO DONT STIR FROM HERE FOR HIS SAKE LET ME GO AND LISTEN
1222-133834-0016 SHE SHUDDERED TO APPROACH THE PIT BUT SHE CREPT TOWARDS IT ON HER HANDS AND KNEES AND CALLED TO HIM AS LOUD AS SHE COULD CALL SHE LISTENED BUT NO SOUND REPLIED SHE CALLED AGAIN AND LISTENED STILL NO ANSWERING SOUND SHE DID THIS TWENTY THIRTY TIMES
1222-133834-0017 SHE TOOK A LITTLE CLOD OF EARTH FROM THE BROKEN GROUND WHERE HE HAD STUMBLED AND THREW IT IN SHE COULD NOT HEAR IT FALL THE WIDE PROSPECT SO BEAUTIFUL IN ITS STILLNESS BUT A FEW MINUTES AGO ALMOST CARRIED DESPAIR TO HER BRAVE HEART AS SHE ROSE AND LOOKED ALL ROUND HER
1222-133834-0018 SHE KNEW BY RACHAELS FACE THAT SHE MIGHT TRUST HER NOW AND AFTER STANDING FOR A MOMENT TO SEE HER RUNNING WRINGING HER HANDS AS SHE RAN SHE TURNED AND WENT UPON HER OWN SEARCH SHE STOPPED AT THE HEDGE TO TIE HER SHAWL THERE AS A GUIDE TO THE PLACE
1222-133834-0019 THEN THREW HER BONNET ASIDE AND RAN AS SHE HAD NEVER RUN BEFORE RUN SISSY RUN IN HEAVENS NAME DONT STOP FOR BREATH RUN RUN QUICKENING HERSELF BY CARRYING SUCH ENTREATIES IN HER THOUGHTS SHE RAN FROM FIELD TO FIELD AND
1222-133834-0020 LANE TO LANE AND PLACE TO PLACE AS SHE HAD NEVER RUN BEFORE UNTIL SHE CAME TO A SHED BY AN ENGINE HOUSE WHERE TWO MEN LAY IN THE SHADE ASLEEP ON STRAW FIRST TO WAKE THEM AND NEXT TO TELL THEM ALL SO WILD AND BREATHLESS AS SHE WAS WHAT HAD BROUGHT HER THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES
1222-133834-0021 BUT THEY NO SOONER UNDERSTOOD HER THAN THEIR SPIRITS WERE ON FIRE LIKE HERS ONE OF THE MEN WAS IN A DRUNKEN SLUMBER BUT ON HIS COMRADES SHOUTING TO HIM THAT A MAN HAD FALLEN DOWN THE OLD HELL SHAFT HE STARTED OUT TO A POOL OF DIRTY WATER PUT HIS HEAD IN IT AND CAME BACK SOBER
1222-133834-0022 WITH THESE TWO MEN SHE RAN TO ANOTHER HALF A MILE FURTHER AND WITH THAT ONE TO ANOTHER WHILE THEY RAN ELSEWHERE THEN A HORSE WAS FOUND AND SHE GOT ANOTHER MAN TO RIDE FOR LIFE OR DEATH TO THE RAILROAD AND SEND A MESSAGE TO LOUISA WHICH SHE WROTE AND GAVE HIM
1222-133834-0023 INCLUDING THE DRUNKEN MAN WHOM THE NEWS HAD SOBERED
1222-133834-0024 WHEN THEY CAME TO THE OLD HELL SHAFT THEY FOUND IT AS LONELY AS SHE HAD LEFT IT THE MEN CALLED AND LISTENED AS SHE HAD DONE AND EXAMINED THE EDGE OF THE CHASM AND SETTLED HOW IT HAD HAPPENED AND THEN SAT DOWN TO WAIT UNTIL THE IMPLEMENTS THEY WANTED SHOULD COME UP
1222-133834-0025 EVERY SOUND OF INSECTS IN THE AIR EVERY STIRRING OF THE LEAVES EVERY WHISPER AMONG THESE MEN MADE SISSY TREMBLE FOR SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A CRY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT BUT THE WIND BLEW IDLY OVER IT AND NO SOUND AROSE TO THE SURFACE AND THEY SAT UPON THE GRASS
1222-133834-0026 BUT THE EXPECTATION AMONG THE PEOPLE THAT THE MAN WOULD BE FOUND ALIVE WAS VERY SLIGHT INDEED THERE BEING NOW PEOPLE ENOUGH PRESENT TO IMPEDE THE WORK THE SOBERED MAN PUT HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF THE REST OR WAS PUT THERE BY THE GENERAL CONSENT
1222-133834-0027 AND MADE A LARGE RING ROUND THE OLD HELL SHAFT AND APPOINTED MEN TO KEEP IT BESIDES SUCH VOLUNTEERS AS WERE ACCEPTED TO WORK ONLY SISSY AND RACHAEL WERE AT FIRST PERMITTED WITHIN THIS RING BUT LATER IN THE DAY WHEN THE MESSAGE BROUGHT AN EXPRESS FROM COKETOWN
1222-133834-0028 MISTER GRADGRIND AND LOUISA AND MISTER BOUNDERBY AND THE WHELP WERE ALSO THERE
1222-133834-0029 BEFORE A MEANS OF ENABLING TWO MEN TO DESCEND SECURELY WAS RIGGED WITH POLES AND ROPES DIFFICULTIES HAD ARISEN IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS MACHINE SIMPLE AS IT WAS REQUISITES HAD BEEN FOUND WANTING AND
1222-133834-0030 THAT CAME AS IT WAS WONT TO COME THE SIGNAL WAS GIVEN AND THE WINDLASS STOPPED WITH ABUNDANT ROPE TO SPARE APPARENTLY SO LONG AN INTERVAL ENSUED WITH THE MEN AT THE WINDLASS STANDING IDLE THAT SOME WOMEN SHRIEKED THAT ANOTHER ACCIDENT HAD HAPPENED BUT THE SURGEON WHO HELD THE WATCH
1222-133834-0031 AND THAT ONLY ONE WAS RETURNING THE ROPE CAME IN TIGHT AND STRAINED AND RING AFTER RING WAS COILED UPON THE BARREL OF THE WINDLASS AND ALL EYES WERE FASTENED ON THE PIT THE SOBERED MAN WAS BROUGHT UP AND LEAPED OUT BRISKLY ON THE GRASS
1222-133834-0032 THAT WE DONNO HOW TO GET HIM UP THEY ALL CONSULTED TOGETHER AND LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT THE SURGEON AS HE ASKED SOME QUESTIONS AND SHOOK HIS HEAD ON RECEIVING THE REPLIES THE SUN WAS SETTING NOW AND THE RED LIGHT IN THE EVENING SKY TOUCHED EVERY FACE THERE AND CAUSED IT TO BE DISTINCTLY SEEN
1222-133834-0033 IN ALL ITS RAPT SUSPENSE THE CONSULTATION ENDED IN THE MEN RETURNING TO THE WINDLASS AND THE PITMAN GOING DOWN AGAIN CARRYING THE WINE AND SOME OTHER SMALL MATTERS WITH HIM THEN THE OTHER MAN CAME UP IN THE MEANTIME UNDER THE SURGEONS DIRECTIONS SOME MEN BROUGHT A HURDLE
1222-133834-0034 ON WHICH OTHERS MADE A THICK BED OF SPARE CLOTHES COVERED WITH LOOSE STRAW WHILE HE HIMSELF CONTRIVED SOME BANDAGES AND SLINGS FROM SHAWLS AND HANDKERCHIEFS AS THESE WERE MADE THEY WERE HUNG UPON AN ARM OF THE PITMAN WHO HAD LAST COME UP WITH INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO USE THEM AND AS HE STOOD
1222-133834-0035 IT APPEARED FROM THE LITTLE THIS MAN SAID TO THOSE ABOUT HIM WHICH WAS QUICKLY REPEATED ALL OVER THE CIRCLE THAT THE LOST MAN HAD FALLEN UPON A MASS OF CRUMBLED RUBBISH WITH WHICH THE PIT WAS HALF CHOKED UP AND THAT HIS FALL HAD BEEN FURTHER BROKEN BY SOME JAGGED EARTH AT THE SIDE
1222-133834-0036 OF WHICH HE HAD SWALLOWED CRUMBS AND HAD LIKEWISE SCOOPED UP A LITTLE WATER IN IT NOW AND THEN HE HAD COME STRAIGHT AWAY FROM HIS WORK ON BEING WRITTEN TO
1222-133834-0037 WAS WORTHY OF ITS BAD NAME TO THE LAST FOR THOUGH STEPHEN COULD SPEAK NOW HE BELIEVED IT WOULD SOON BE FOUND TO HAVE MANGLED THE LIFE OUT OF HIM WHEN ALL WAS READY THIS MAN STILL TAKING HIS LAST HURRIED CHARGES FROM HIS COMRADES AND THE SURGEON AFTER THE WINDLASS HAD BEGUN TO LOWER HIM
1222-133834-0038 AT LENGTH THE SIGNAL WAS GIVEN AND ALL THE RING LEANED FORWARD FOR NOW THE ROPE CAME IN TIGHTENED AND STRAINED TO ITS UTMOST AS IT APPEARED AND THE MEN TURNED HEAVILY AND THE WINDLASS COMPLAINED IT WAS SCARCELY ENDURABLE TO LOOK AT THE ROPE AND THINK OF ITS GIVING WAY
1222-133834-0039 BUT RING AFTER RING WAS COILED UPON THE BARREL OF THE WINDLASS SAFELY AND THE CONNECTING CHAINS APPEARED AND FINALLY THE BUCKET WITH THE TWO MEN HOLDING ON AT THE SIDESA SIGHT TO MAKE THE HEAD SWIM AND OPPRESS THE HEARTAND TENDERLY SUPPORTING BETWEEN THEM SLUNG AND TIED WITHIN
1222-133834-0040 THE FIGURE OF A POOR CRUSHED HUMAN CREATURE A LOW MURMUR OF PITY WENT ROUND THE THRONG AND THE WOMEN WEPT ALOUD AS THIS FORM ALMOST WITHOUT FORM WAS MOVED VERY SLOWLY FROM ITS IRON DELIVERANCE
1222-133834-0041 AND LAID UPON THE BED OF STRAW AT FIRST
1222-133834-0042 THE BEST THAT HE COULD DO WAS TO COVER IT THAT GENTLY DONE HE CALLED TO HIM RACHAEL AND SISSY AND AT THAT TIME THE PALE WORN PATIENT FACE WAS SEEN LOOKING UP AT THE SKY WITH THE BROKEN RIGHT HAND LYING BARE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE COVERING GARMENTS
1222-133834-0043 AND SAID RACHAEL SHE STOOPED DOWN ON THE GRASS AT HIS SIDE AND BENT OVER HIM UNTIL HER EYES WERE BETWEEN HIS AND THE SKY FOR HE COULD NOT SO MUCH AS TURN THEM TO LOOK AT HER RACHAEL MY DEAR SHE TOOK HIS HAND HE SMILED AGAIN AND SAID
