1773-145729-0000 AND AT LAST HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO MARRY AGAIN FEELING THAT A WIFE WOULD BRING PEACE AND ORDER TO HIS HOUSEHOLD AND TAKE CARE OF HIS MOTHERLESS CHILDREN SO HE MARRIED AND IN THE FOLLOWING YEARS SEVERAL CHILDREN WERE BORN TO HIM
1773-145729-0001 BUT PEACE AND ORDER DID NOT COME TO THE HOUSEHOLD FOR THE STEP MOTHER WAS VERY CRUEL TO THE TWINS AND BEAT THEM AND HALF STARVED THEM AND CONSTANTLY DROVE THEM OUT OF THE HOUSE FOR HER ONE IDEA WAS TO GET THEM OUT OF THE WAY
1773-145729-0002 ALL DAY SHE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT HOW SHE SHOULD GET RID OF THEM
1773-145729-0003 WHERE A WICKED WITCH LIVED AND SO ONE MORNING SHE SPOKE TO THEM SAYING YOU HAVE BEEN SUCH
1773-145729-0004 YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT UPON HER AND SERVE HER BUT YOU WILL BE WELL REWARDED
1773-145729-0005 SO THE CHILDREN LEFT THE HOUSE TOGETHER AND THE LITTLE SISTER
1773-145729-0006 AND WHEN THE GRANDMOTHER HEARD WHERE THEY WERE GOING SHE CRIED AND SAID
1773-145729-0007 NOW LISTEN TO ME CHILDREN
1773-145729-0008 A QUEER LITTLE HUT AND WHEN THEY LOOKED INTO IT THERE LAY THE WITCH WITH HER HEAD ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE DOOR WITH ONE FOOT IN ONE CORNER AND THE OTHER IN THE OTHER CORNER AND HER KNEES COCKED UP ALMOST TOUCHING THE CEILING
1773-145729-0009 WHO'S THERE SHE SNARLED IN AN AWFUL VOICE WHEN SHE SAW THE CHILDREN AND THEY ANSWERED CIVILLY
1773-145729-0010 THE CAT WAS CURLED UP ON THE FLOOR SO THEY STROKED HER AND FED HER WITH HAM AND SAID TO HER
1773-145729-0011 AND RUN AS FAST AS THEY COULD AS SOON AS THE HANDKERCHIEF TOUCHED THE GROUND A DEEP BROAD RIVER WOULD SPRING UP WHICH WOULD HINDER THE WITCH'S PROGRESS IF SHE MANAGED TO GET ACROSS IT THEY
1773-145729-0012 MUST THROW THE COMB BEHIND THEM AND RUN FOR THEIR LIVES FOR WHERE THE COMB FELL A DENSE FOREST WOULD START UP WHICH WOULD DELAY THE WITCH SO LONG
1773-145729-0013 AND TREMBLING IN EVERY LIMB THE POOR CHILDREN LAY DOWN TO SLEEP ON A HEAP OF STRAW IN THE CORNER OF THE HUT BUT THEY DARED NOT CLOSE THEIR EYES AND SCARCELY VENTURED TO BREATHE
1773-145729-0014 IN THE MORNING THE WITCH GAVE THE GIRL TWO PIECES OF LINEN TO WEAVE BEFORE NIGHT AND THE BOY A PILE OF WOOD TO CUT INTO CHIPS THEN THE WITCH LEFT THEM TO THEIR TASKS
1773-145729-0015 AS SOON AS SHE HAD GONE OUT OF SIGHT
1773-145729-0016 AND TAKING ONE ANOTHER BY THE HAND
1773-145729-0017 WHOSE BRANCHES ALMOST PUT THEIR EYES OUT BUT THE LITTLE SISTER TIED THE TWIGS TOGETHER WITH A PIECE OF RIBBON AND THEY GOT PAST SAFELY AND AFTER RUNNING THROUGH THE WOOD CAME OUT ON TO THE OPEN FIELDS
1773-145729-0018 IN THE MEANTIME IN THE HUT THE CAT WAS BUSY WEAVING THE LINEN AND TANGLING THE THREADS AS IT WOVE AND THE WITCH RETURNED TO SEE HOW THE CHILDREN WERE GETTING ON
1773-145729-0019 I HAVE SERVED YOU ALL THESE YEARS AND YOU NEVER GAVE ME SO MUCH AS A HARD CRUST
1773-145729-0020 WAS TO MOUNT ON HER BROOM AND SET OFF IN PURSUIT OF THE CHILDREN AND AS THE CHILDREN RAN THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF THE BROOM SWEEPING THE GROUND CLOSE BEHIND THEM
1773-145729-0021 SO INSTANTLY THEY THREW THE HANDKERCHIEF DOWN OVER THEIR SHOULDER AND IN A MOMENT A DEEP BROAD RIVER FLOWED BEHIND THEM WHEN THE WITCH CAME UP TO IT IT TOOK HER A LONG TIME
1773-145729-0022 AND THE LITTLE SISTER PUT HER EAR TO THE GROUND AND HEARD THE BROOM SWEEPING THE EARTH CLOSE BEHIND THEM SO QUICK AS THOUGHT SHE THREW THE COMB DOWN ON THE GROUND AND IN AN INSTANT AS THE CAT HAD SAID
1773-145729-0023 A DENSE FOREST SPRUNG UP IN WHICH THE ROOTS AND BRANCHES WERE SO CLOSELY INTERTWINED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FORCE A WAY THROUGH IT
1773-145729-0024 SHE FOUND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO TURN ROUND AND GO BACK TO HER HUT
1773-145729-0025 THEN THEY TOLD THEIR FATHER ALL THAT THEY HAD SUFFERED AND HE WAS SO ANGRY WITH THEIR STEP MOTHER THAT HE DROVE HER OUT OF THE HOUSE AND NEVER LET HER RETURN BUT HE AND THE CHILDREN LIVED HAPPILY TOGETHER AND HE TOOK CARE OF THEM HIMSELF
