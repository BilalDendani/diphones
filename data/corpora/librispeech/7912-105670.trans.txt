7912-105670-0000 THE KING AT LAST BEGAN TO THINK THE MATTER WORTHY OF HIS ATTENTION AND HAVING ORDERED ELIZABETH AND HER ACCOMPLICES TO BE ARRESTED HE BROUGHT THEM BEFORE THE STAR CHAMBER WHERE THEY FREELY WITHOUT BEING PUT TO THE TORTURE MADE CONFESSION OF THEIR GUILT
7912-105670-0001 THE PARLIAMENT IN THE SESSION HELD THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR PASSED AN ACT OF ATTAINDER AGAINST SOME WHO WERE ENGAGED IN THIS TREASONABLE IMPOSTURE AND ELIZABETH HERSELF MASTERS BOCKING DEERING RICH
7912-105670-0002 RISBY GOLD SUFFERED FOR THEIR CRIME THE BISHOP OF ROCHESTER ABEL ADDISON LAWRENCE AND OTHERS WERE CONDEMNED FOR MISPRISION OF TREASON BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT DISCOVERED SOME CRIMINAL SPEECHES WHICH THEY HEARD FROM ELIZABETH
7912-105670-0003 AND THEY WERE THROWN INTO PRISON THE BETTER TO UNDECEIVE THE MULTITUDE THE FORGERY OF MANY OF THE PROPHETESS'S MIRACLES WAS DETECTED AND EVEN THE SCANDALOUS PROSTITUTION OF HER MANNERS WAS LAID OPEN TO THE PUBLIC
7912-105670-0004 THOSE PASSIONS WHICH SO NATURALLY INSINUATE THEMSELVES AMIDST THE WARM INTIMACIES MAINTAINED BY THE DEVOTEES OF DIFFERENT SEXES HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN ELIZABETH AND HER CONFEDERATES AND IT WAS FOUND THAT A DOOR TO HER DORMITORY
7912-105670-0005 AND INSTIGATED THE KING TO TAKE VENGEANCE ON THEM HE SUPPRESSED THREE MONASTERIES OF THE OBSERVANTINE FRIARS AND FINDING THAT LITTLE CLAMOR WAS EXCITED BY THIS ACT OF POWER
7912-105670-0006 HE WAS THE MORE ENCOURAGED TO LAY HIS RAPACIOUS HANDS ON THE REMAINDER MEANWHILE HE EXERCISED PUNISHMENT ON INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE OBNOXIOUS TO HIM THE PARLIAMENT HAD MADE IT TREASON TO ENDEAVOR DEPRIVING THE KING OF HIS DIGNITY OR TITLES
7912-105670-0007 THEY HAD LATELY ADDED TO HIS OTHER TITLES THAT OF SUPREME HEAD OF THE CHURCH IT WAS INFERRED THAT TO DENY HIS SUPREMACY WAS TREASON AND MANY PRIORS AND ECCLESIASTICS LOST THEIR LIVES FOR THIS NEW SPECIES OF GUILT
7912-105670-0008 IT WAS CERTAINLY A HIGH INSTANCE OF TYRANNY TO PUNISH THE MERE DELIVERY OF A POLITICAL OPINION
7912-105670-0009 HAD OVERLOOKED ALL THE PRINCIPLES BY WHICH A CIVILIZED MUCH MORE A FREE PEOPLE SHOULD BE GOVERNED
7912-105670-0010 BUT THE VIOLENCE OF CHANGING SO SUDDENLY THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT AND MAKING IT TREASON TO DENY WHAT DURING MANY AGES IT HAD BEEN HERESY TO ASSERT IS AN EVENT WHICH MAY APPEAR SOMEWHAT EXTRAORDINARY
7912-105670-0011 EVEN THE STERN UNRELENTING MIND OF HENRY
7912-105670-0012 AND HE WENT SO FAR AS TO CHANGE HIS GARB AND DRESS PRETENDING SORROW FOR THE NECESSITY BY WHICH HE WAS PUSHED TO SUCH EXTREMITIES STILL IMPELLED HOWEVER BY HIS VIOLENT TEMPER
7912-105670-0013 AND DESIROUS OF STRIKING A TERROR INTO THE WHOLE NATION HE PROCEEDED BY MAKING EXAMPLES OF FISHER AND MORE TO CONSUMMATE HIS LAWLESS TYRANNY JOHN FISHER BISHOP OF ROCHESTER WAS A PRELATE EMINENT FOR LEARNING AND MORALS
7912-105670-0014 STILL MORE THAN FOR HIS ECCLESIASTICAL DIGNITIES AND FOR THE HIGH FAVOR WHICH HE HAD LONG ENJOYED WITH THE KING WHEN HE WAS THROWN INTO PRISON ON ACCOUNT OF HIS REFUSING THE OATH WHICH REGARDED THE SUCCESSION
7912-105670-0015 HE WAS ALLOWED NOTHING BUT RAGS WHICH SCARCELY SUFFICED TO COVER HIS NAKEDNESS IN THIS CONDITION HE LAY IN PRISON ABOVE A TWELVEMONTH WHEN THE POPE WILLING TO RECOMPENSE THE SUFFERINGS OF SO FAITHFUL AN ADHERENT
7912-105670-0016 CREATED HIM A CARDINAL THOUGH FISHER WAS SO INDIFFERENT ABOUT THAT DIGNITY THAT EVEN IF THE PURPLE WERE LYING AT HIS FEET HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NOT STOOP TO TAKE IT
7912-105670-0017 THIS PROMOTION OF A MAN MERELY FOR HIS OPPOSITION TO ROYAL AUTHORITY ROUSED THE INDIGNATION OF THE KING
7912-105670-0018 WHO KEPT A CAUTIOUS SILENCE WITH REGARD TO THE SUPREMACY HE WAS ONLY INVEIGLED TO SAY THAT ANY QUESTION WITH REGARD TO THE LAW WHICH ESTABLISHED THAT PREROGATIVE WAS A TWO EDGED SWORD
7912-105670-0019 IF A PERSON ANSWER ONE WAY IT WILL CONFOUND HIS SOUL IF ANOTHER IT WILL DESTROY HIS BODY NO MORE WAS WANTED TO FOUND AN INDICTMENT OF HIGH TREASON AGAINST THE PRISONER HIS SILENCE WAS CALLED MALICIOUS AND MADE A PART OF HIS CRIME
7912-105670-0020 AND THESE WORDS WHICH HAD CASUALLY DROPPED FROM HIM WERE INTERPRETED AS A DENIAL OF THE SUPREMACY TRIALS WERE MERE FORMALITIES DURING THIS REIGN THE JURY GAVE SENTENCE AGAINST MORE WHO HAD LONG EXPECTED THIS FATE
7912-105670-0021 AND HE MADE A SACRIFICE OF HIS LIFE TO HIS INTEGRITY WITH THE SAME INDIFFERENCE THAT HE MAINTAINED IN ANY ORDINARY OCCURRENCE WHEN HE WAS MOUNTING THE SCAFFOLD HE SAID TO ONE FRIEND HELP ME UP
7912-105670-0022 AND WHEN I COME DOWN AGAIN LET ME SHIFT FOR MYSELF THE EXECUTIONER ASKING HIM FORGIVENESS HE GRANTED THE REQUEST BUT TOLD HIM YOU WILL NEVER GET CREDIT BY BEHEADING ME MY NECK IS SO SHORT
7912-105670-0023 AND PAUL THE THIRD OF THE NAME OF FARNESE HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE PAPAL THRONE THIS PONTIFF WHO WHILE CARDINAL HAD ALWAYS FAVORED HENRY'S CAUSE HAD HOPED THAT PERSONAL ANIMOSITIES BEING BURIED WITH HIS PREDECESSOR
7912-105670-0024 AND THE KING HIMSELF WAS SO DESIROUS OF ACCOMMODATING MATTERS THAT IN A NEGOTIATION WHICH HE ENTERED INTO WITH FRANCIS A LITTLE BEFORE THIS TIME HE REQUIRED THAT THAT MONARCH SHOULD CONCILIATE A FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN HIM AND THE COURT OF ROME
7912-105670-0025 BUT HENRY WAS ACCUSTOMED TO PRESCRIBE NOT TO RECEIVE TERMS AND EVEN WHILE HE WAS NEGOTIATING FOR PEACE HIS USUAL VIOLENCE OFTEN CARRIED HIM TO COMMIT OFFENCES WHICH RENDERED THE QUARREL TOTALLY INCURABLE
7912-105670-0026 THE EXECUTION OF FISHER WAS REGARDED BY PAUL AS SO CAPITAL AN INJURY THAT HE IMMEDIATELY PASSED CENSURES AGAINST THE KING CITING HIM AND ALL HIS ADHERENTS TO APPEAR IN ROME
7912-105670-0027 WITHIN NINETY DAYS IN ORDER TO ANSWER FOR THEIR CRIMES IF THEY FAILED HE EXCOMMUNICATED THEM DEPRIVED THE KING OF HIS CROWN LAID THE KINGDOM UNDER AN INTERDICT DECLARED HIS ISSUE BY ANNE BOLEYN ILLEGITIMATE
7912-105670-0028 DISSOLVED ALL LEAGUES WHICH ANY CATHOLIC PRINCES HAD MADE WITH HIM GAVE HIS KINGDOM TO ANY INVADER COMMANDED THE NOBILITY TO TAKE ARMS AGAINST HIM FREED HIS SUBJECTS FROM ALL OATHS OF ALLEGIANCE CUT OFF THEIR COMMERCE WITH FOREIGN STATES
7912-105670-0029 AND DECLARED IT LAWFUL FOR ANY ONE TO SEIZE THEM TO MAKE SLAVES OF THEIR PERSONS AND TO CONVERT THEIR EFFECTS TO HIS OWN USE BUT THOUGH THESE CENSURES WERE PASSED THEY WERE NOT AT THAT TIME OPENLY DENOUNCED
7912-105670-0030 THE POPE DELAYED THE PUBLICATION TILL HE SHOULD FIND AN AGREEMENT WITH ENGLAND ENTIRELY DESPERATE AND TILL THE EMPEROR WHO WAS AT THAT TIME HARD PRESSED BY THE TURKS AND THE PROTESTANT PRINCES IN GERMANY SHOULD BE IN A CONDITION TO CARRY THE SENTENCE INTO EXECUTION
7912-105670-0031 AND HENRY BESIDES REMITTING THEM SOME MONEY SENT FOX BISHOP OF HEREFORD AS FRANCIS DID BELLAY LORD OF LANGLEY TO TREAT WITH THEM
7912-105670-0032 BUT DURING THE FIRST FERVORS OF THE REFORMATION AN AGREEMENT IN THEOLOGICAL TENETS WAS HELD AS WELL AS A UNION OF INTERESTS TO BE ESSENTIAL TO A GOOD CORRESPONDENCE AMONG STATES
7912-105670-0033 THESE THEOLOGIANS WERE NOW OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN THE WORLD AND NO POET OR PHILOSOPHER EVEN IN ANCIENT GREECE WHERE THEY WERE TREATED WITH MOST RESPECT
7912-105670-0034 HAD EVER REACHED EQUAL APPLAUSE AND ADMIRATION WITH THOSE WRETCHED COMPOSERS OF METAPHYSICAL POLEMICS THE GERMAN PRINCES TOLD THE KING THAT THEY COULD NOT SPARE THEIR DIVINES AND AS HENRY HAD NO HOPES OF AGREEMENT WITH SUCH ZEALOUS DISPUTANTS
7912-105670-0035 BECAUSE THOUGH THEY AGREED IN EVERY THING ELSE THEY DIFFERED IN SOME MINUTE PARTICULARS WITH REGARD TO THE EUCHARIST HE WAS THE MORE INDIFFERENT ON ACCOUNT OF THIS REFUSAL
7912-105670-0036 WOULD BE RATIFIED IN HEAVEN AND THAT SHE HAD NO OTHER REQUEST TO MAKE THAN TO RECOMMEND TO HIM HIS DAUGHTER THE SOLE PLEDGE OF THEIR LOVES AND TO CRAVE HIS PROTECTION FOR HER MAIDS AND SERVANTS SHE CONCLUDED WITH THESE WORDS
7912-105670-0037 THE KING WAS TOUCHED EVEN TO THE SHEDDING OF TEARS BY THIS LAST TENDER PROOF OF CATHARINE'S AFFECTION BUT QUEEN ANNE IS SAID TO HAVE EXPRESSED HER JOY FOR THE DEATH OF A RIVAL BEYOND WHAT DECENCY OR HUMANITY COULD PERMIT
7912-105670-0038 THE EMPEROR THOUGHT THAT AS THE DEMISE OF HIS AUNT HAD REMOVED ALL FOUNDATION OF PERSONAL ANIMOSITY BETWEEN HIM AND HENRY IT MIGHT NOT NOW BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DETACH HIM FROM THE ALLIANCE OF FRANCE
7912-105670-0039 PROVIDED THAT PRINCE WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE FORMER BREACH OF FRIENDSHIP CAME ENTIRELY FROM HIMSELF AS TO THE CONDITIONS PROPOSED THE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE BISHOP OF ROME
7912-105670-0040 WERE SO JUST AND SO FULLY RATIFIED BY THE PARLIAMENT OF ENGLAND THAT THEY COULD NOT NOW BE REVOKED WHEN CHRISTIAN PRINCES SHOULD HAVE SETTLED PEACE AMONG THEMSELVES
7912-105670-0041 HE WOULD NOT FAIL TO EXERT THAT VIGOR WHICH BECAME HIM AGAINST THE ENEMIES OF THE FAITH AND AFTER AMITY WITH THE EMPEROR WAS ONCE FULLY RESTORED HE SHOULD THEN BE IN A SITUATION
7912-105670-0042 AS HEAD OF THE GERMANIC BODY NOT TO GIVE UMBRAGE HOWEVER TO THE STATES OF ITALY HE PROFESSED HIS INTENTION OF BESTOWING THAT PRINCIPALITY ON SOME PRINCE WHO SHOULD BE OBNOXIOUS TO NO PARTY
7912-105670-0043 AND HE EVEN MADE OFFER OF IT TO THE DUKE OF ANGOULEME THIRD SON OF FRANCIS THE FRENCH MONARCH WHO PRETENDED THAT HIS OWN RIGHT TO MILAN WAS NOW REVIVED UPON SFORZA'S DEATH WAS CONTENT TO SUBSTITUTE HIS SECOND SON
7912-105670-0044 AND BE ABLE TO CARRY AN INVASION INTO FRANCIS'S DOMINIONS THE ANCIENT ENMITY BETWEEN THESE PRINCES BROKE OUT ANEW IN BRAVADOES AND IN PERSONAL INSULTS ON EACH OTHER ILL BECOMING PERSONS OF THEIR RANK
7912-105670-0045 AND STILL LESS SUITABLE TO MEN OF SUCH UNQUESTIONED BRAVERY CHARLES SOON AFTER INVADED PROVENCE IN PERSON WITH AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND MEN BUT MET WITH NO SUCCESS HIS ARMY PERISHED WITH SICKNESS FATIGUE
7912-105670-0046 BOTH THAT HIS ALLY FRANCIS WAS LIKELY TO SUPPORT HIMSELF WITHOUT FOREIGN ASSISTANCE AND THAT HIS OWN TRANQUILLITY WAS FULLY INSURED
7912-105670-0047 BY THESE VIOLENT WARS AND ANIMOSITIES ON THE CONTINENT IF ANY INQUIETUDE REMAINED WITH THE ENGLISH COURT IT WAS SOLELY OCCASIONED BY THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN SCOTLAND JAMES HEARING OF THE DANGEROUS SITUATION OF HIS ALLY FRANCIS
7912-105670-0048 GENEROUSLY LEVIED SOME FORCES AND EMBARKING THEM ON BOARD VESSELS WHICH HE HAD HIRED FOR THAT PURPOSE LANDED THEM SAFELY IN FRANCE HE EVEN WENT OVER IN PERSON AND MAKING HASTE TO JOIN THE CAMP OF THE FRENCH KING
7912-105670-0049 WHICH THEN LAY IN PROVENCE AND TO PARTAKE OF HIS DANGER
7912-105670-0050 RECOMMENDED BY SO AGREEABLE AND SEASONABLE AN INSTANCE OF FRIENDSHIP THE KING OF SCOTS PAID HIS ADDRESSES TO MAGDALEN DAUGHTER OF THE FRENCH MONARCH AND THIS PRINCE HAD NO OTHER OBJECTION TO THE MATCH
7912-105670-0051 THAN WHAT AROSE FROM THE INFIRM STATE OF HIS DAUGHTER'S HEALTH WHICH SEEMED TO THREATEN HER WITH AN APPROACHING END BUT JAMES HAVING GAINED THE AFFECTIONS OF THE PRINCESS AND OBTAINED HER CONSENT
7912-105670-0052 THE FATHER WOULD NO LONGER OPPOSE THE UNITED DESIRES OF HIS DAUGHTER AND HIS FRIEND THEY WERE ACCORDINGLY MARRIED AND SOON AFTER SET SAIL FOR SCOTLAND WHERE THE YOUNG QUEEN AS WAS FORESEEN
7912-105670-0053 DIED IN A LITTLE TIME AFTER HER ARRIVAL FRANCIS HOWEVER WAS AFRAID LEST HIS ALLY HENRY WHOM HE LIKEWISE LOOKED ON AS HIS FRIEND AND WHO LIVED WITH HIM ON A MORE CORDIAL FOOTING THAN IS USUAL AMONG GREAT PRINCES
7912-105670-0054 AND FRANCIS WAS APPREHENSIVE OF A RUPTURE WITH A PRINCE WHO REGULATED HIS MEASURES MORE BY HUMOR AND PASSION THAN BY THE RULES OF POLITICAL PRUDENCE
7912-105670-0055 THAT HE PURSUED NO FURTHER THIS DISGUST AGAINST FRANCIS AND IN THE END EVERY THING REMAINED IN TRANQUILLITY BOTH ON THE SIDE OF FRANCE AND OF SCOTLAND THE DOMESTIC PEACE OF ENGLAND SEEMED TO BE EXPOSED TO MORE HAZARD BY THE VIOLENT INNOVATIONS IN RELIGION
7912-105670-0056 AND IT MAY BE AFFIRMED THAT IN THIS DANGEROUS CONJUNCTURE NOTHING INSURED PUBLIC TRANQUILLITY SO MUCH AS THE DECISIVE AUTHORITY ACQUIRED BY THE KING AND HIS GREAT ASCENDANT OVER ALL HIS SUBJECTS
7912-105670-0057 NOT ONLY THE DEVOTION PAID TO THE CROWN WAS PROFOUND DURING THAT AGE THE PERSONAL RESPECT INSPIRED BY HENRY WAS CONSIDERABLE AND EVEN THE TERRORS WITH WHICH HE OVERAWED EVERY ONE
7912-105670-0058 WERE NOT ATTENDED WITH ANY CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF HATRED HIS FRANKNESS HIS SINCERITY HIS MAGNIFICENCE HIS GENEROSITY WERE VIRTUES WHICH COUNTERBALANCED HIS VIOLENCE CRUELTY AND IMPETUOSITY
7912-105670-0059 AND THE IMPORTANT RANK WHICH HIS VIGOR MORE THAN HIS ADDRESS ACQUIRED HIM IN ALL FOREIGN NEGOTIATIONS FLATTERED THE VANITY OF ENGLISHMEN AND MADE THEM THE MORE WILLINGLY ENDURE THOSE DOMESTIC HARDSHIPS TO WHICH THEY WERE EXPOSED
7912-105670-0060 THE KING CONSCIOUS OF HIS ADVANTAGES WAS NOW PROCEEDING TO THE MOST DANGEROUS EXERCISE OF HIS AUTHORITY AND AFTER PAVING THE WAY FOR THAT MEASURE BY SEVERAL PREPARATORY EXPEDIENTS
