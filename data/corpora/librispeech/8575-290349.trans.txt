8575-290349-0000 MIGHT PERHAPS PERSUADE ONE THAT TIME WHICH REVEALS ALL OTHER THINGS IS ITSELF NOT TO BE DISCOVERED DURATION TIME AND ETERNITY ARE NOT WITHOUT REASON THOUGHT TO HAVE SOMETHING VERY ABSTRUSE IN THEIR NATURE
8575-290349-0001 WILL BE ABLE TO FURNISH US WITH THESE IDEAS AS CLEAR AND DISTINCT AS MANY OTHERS WHICH ARE THOUGHT MUCH LESS OBSCURE AND WE SHALL FIND THAT THE IDEA OF ETERNITY ITSELF IS DERIVED FROM THE SAME COMMON ORIGINAL WITH THE REST OF OUR IDEAS THREE NATURE AND ORIGIN
8575-290349-0002 OF THE IDEA OF DURATION TO UNDERSTAND TIME AND ETERNITY ARIGHT WE OUGHT WITH ATTENTION TO CONSIDER WHAT IDEA IT IS WE HAVE OF DURATION AND HOW WE CAME BY IT IT IS EVIDENT TO ANY ONE WHO WILL BUT OBSERVE WHAT PASSES IN HIS OWN MIND
8575-290349-0003 THAT THERE IS A TRAIN OF IDEAS WHICH CONSTANTLY SUCCEED ONE ANOTHER IN HIS UNDERSTANDING AS LONG AS HE IS AWAKE REFLECTION ON THESE APPEARANCES OF SEVERAL IDEAS ONE AFTER ANOTHER IN OUR MINDS IS THAT WHICH FURNISHES US WITH THE IDEA OF SUCCESSION
8575-290349-0004 AND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN ANY PARTS OF THAT SUCCESSION OR BETWEEN THE APPEARANCE OF ANY TWO IDEAS IN OUR MINDS IS THAT WE CALL DURATION
8575-290349-0005 WE KNOW THAT WE DO EXIST AND SO WE CALL THE EXISTENCE OR THE CONTINUATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF OURSELVES OR ANYTHING ELSE COMMENSURATE TO THE SUCCESSION OF ANY IDEAS IN OUR MINDS THE DURATION OF OURSELVES OR ANY SUCH OTHER THING CO EXISTENT WITH OUR THINKING
8575-290349-0006 IN THAT WE HAVE NO PERCEPTION OF DURATION BUT BY CONSIDERING THE TRAIN OF IDEAS THAT TAKE THEIR TURNS IN OUR UNDERSTANDINGS WHEN THAT SUCCESSION OF IDEAS CEASES OUR PERCEPTION OF DURATION CEASES WITH IT WHICH EVERY ONE CLEARLY EXPERIMENTS IN HIMSELF WHILST HE SLEEPS SOUNDLY
8575-290349-0007 OF WHICH DURATION OF THINGS WHILE HE SLEEPS OR THINKS NOT HE HAS NO PERCEPTION AT ALL BUT IT IS QUITE LOST TO HIM AND THE MOMENT WHEREIN HE LEAVES OFF TO THINK TILL THE MOMENT HE BEGINS TO THINK AGAIN SEEMS TO HIM TO HAVE NO DISTANCE AND SO I DOUBT NOT
8575-290349-0008 THAN IT IS BUT IF SLEEP COMMONLY UNITES THE DISTANT PARTS OF DURATION IT IS BECAUSE DURING THAT TIME WE HAVE NO SUCCESSION OF IDEAS IN OUR MINDS FOR IF A MAN DURING HIS SLEEP DREAMS AND VARIETY OF IDEAS MAKE THEMSELVES PERCEPTIBLE IN HIS MIND
8575-290349-0009 ONE AFTER ANOTHER HE HATH THEN DURING SUCH DREAMING A SENSE OF DURATION AND OF THE LENGTH OF IT BY WHICH IT IS TO ME VERY CLEAR THAT MEN DERIVE THEIR IDEAS OF DURATION FROM THEIR REFLECTIONS ON THE TRAIN OF THE IDEAS THEY OBSERVE TO SUCCEED ONE ANOTHER IN THEIR OWN UNDERSTANDINGS
8575-290349-0010 INDEED A MAN HAVING FROM REFLECTING ON THE SUCCESSION AND NUMBER OF HIS OWN THOUGHTS GOT THE NOTION OR IDEA OF DURATION HE CAN APPLY THAT NOTION TO THINGS WHICH EXIST WHILE HE DOES NOT THINK
8575-290349-0011 AS HE THAT HAS GOT THE IDEA OF EXTENSION FROM BODIES BY HIS SIGHT OR TOUCH CAN APPLY IT TO DISTANCES WHERE NO BODY IS SEEN OR FELT AND THEREFORE THOUGH A MAN HAS NO PERCEPTION OF THE LENGTH OF DURATION WHICH PASSED WHILST HE SLEPT OR THOUGHT NOT
8575-290349-0012 YET HAVING OBSERVED THE REVOLUTION OF DAYS AND NIGHTS AND FOUND THE LENGTH OF THEIR DURATION TO BE IN APPEARANCE REGULAR AND CONSTANT HE CAN UPON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THAT REVOLUTION HAS PROCEEDED AFTER THE SAME MANNER WHILST HE WAS ASLEEP OR THOUGHT NOT
8575-290349-0013 WE GET THE NOTION OF SUCCESSION WHICH IF ANY ONE SHOULD THINK WE DID RATHER GET FROM OUR OBSERVATION OF MOTION BY OUR SENSES HE WILL PERHAPS BE OF MY MIND WHEN HE CONSIDERS THAT EVEN MOTION PRODUCES IN HIS MIND AN IDEA OF SUCCESSION
8575-290349-0014 NO OTHERWISE THAN AS IT PRODUCES THERE A CONTINUED TRAIN OF DISTINGUISHABLE IDEAS FOR A MAN LOOKING UPON A BODY REALLY MOVING PERCEIVES YET NO MOTION AT ALL UNLESS THAT MOTION PRODUCES A CONSTANT TRAIN OF SUCCESSIVE IDEAS V G A MAN BECALMED AT SEA OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND
8575-290349-0015 AS SOON AS THIS MOTION PRODUCES ANY NEW IDEA IN HIM THEN HE PERCEIVES THAT THERE HAS BEEN MOTION BUT WHEREVER A MAN IS WITH ALL THINGS AT REST ABOUT HIM WITHOUT PERCEIVING ANY MOTION AT ALL IF DURING THIS HOUR OF QUIET HE HAS BEEN THINKING
8575-290349-0016 HE WILL PERCEIVE THE VARIOUS IDEAS OF HIS OWN THOUGHTS IN HIS OWN MIND APPEARING ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND THEREBY OBSERVE AND FIND SUCCESSION WHERE HE COULD OBSERVE NO MOTION SEVEN VERY SLOW MOTIONS UNPERCEIVED
8575-290349-0017 AND THIS I THINK IS THE REASON WHY MOTIONS VERY SLOW THOUGH THEY ARE CONSTANT ARE NOT PERCEIVED BY US BECAUSE IN THEIR REMOVE FROM ONE SENSIBLE PART TOWARDS ANOTHER THEIR CHANGE OF DISTANCE IS SO SLOW THAT IT CAUSES NO NEW IDEAS IN US BUT A GOOD WHILE ONE AFTER ANOTHER
8575-290349-0018 EIGHT VERY SWIFT MOTIONS UNPERCEIVED ON THE CONTRARY THINGS THAT MOVE SO SWIFT AS NOT TO AFFECT THE SENSES DISTINCTLY WITH SEVERAL DISTINGUISHABLE DISTANCES OF THEIR MOTION AND SO CAUSE NOT ANY TRAIN OF IDEAS IN THE MIND ARE NOT ALSO PERCEIVED
8575-290349-0019 NINE THE TRAIN OF IDEAS HAS A CERTAIN DEGREE OF QUICKNESS HENCE I LEAVE IT TO OTHERS TO JUDGE WHETHER IT BE NOT PROBABLE THAT OUR IDEAS DO WHILST WE ARE AWAKE SUCCEED ONE ANOTHER IN OUR MINDS AT CERTAIN DISTANCES
8575-290349-0020 NOT MUCH UNLIKE THE IMAGES IN THE INSIDE OF A LANTERN TURNED ROUND BY THE HEAT OF A CANDLE THIS APPEARANCE OF THEIRS IN TRAIN THOUGH PERHAPS IT MAY BE SOMETIMES FASTER AND SOMETIMES SLOWER YET I GUESS VARIES NOT VERY MUCH IN A WAKING MAN
8575-290349-0021 THERE SEEM TO BE CERTAIN BOUNDS TO THE QUICKNESS AND SLOWNESS OF THE SUCCESSION OF THOSE IDEAS ONE TO ANOTHER IN OUR MINDS BEYOND WHICH THEY CAN NEITHER DELAY NOR HASTEN TEN REAL SUCCESSION IN SWIFT MOTIONS WITHOUT SENSE OF SUCCESSION
8575-290349-0022 IT IS ALSO EVIDENT THAT IT MUST TOUCH ONE PART OF THE FLESH FIRST AND ANOTHER AFTER AND SO IN SUCCESSION AND YET I BELIEVE NOBODY WHO EVER FELT THE PAIN OF SUCH A SHOT OR HEARD THE BLOW AGAINST THE TWO DISTANT WALLS COULD PERCEIVE ANY SUCCESSION EITHER IN THE PAIN OR SOUND OF SO SWIFT A STROKE
8575-290349-0023 SUCH A PART OF DURATION AS THIS WHEREIN WE PERCEIVE NO SUCCESSION IS THAT WHICH WE CALL AN INSTANT AND IS THAT WHICH TAKES UP THE TIME OF ONLY ONE IDEA IN OUR MINDS WITHOUT THE SUCCESSION OF ANOTHER WHEREIN THEREFORE WE PERCEIVE NO SUCCESSION AT ALL ELEVEN IN SLOW MOTIONS
8575-290349-0024 THIS ALSO HAPPENS WHERE THE MOTION IS SO SLOW AS NOT TO SUPPLY A CONSTANT TRAIN OF FRESH IDEAS TO THE SENSES AS FAST AS THE MIND IS CAPABLE OF RECEIVING NEW ONES INTO IT AND SO OTHER IDEAS OF OUR OWN THOUGHTS HAVING ROOM TO COME INTO OUR MINDS BETWEEN THOSE OFFERED TO OUR SENSES BY THE MOVING BODY
8575-290349-0025 THAT IT HATH MOVED YET THE MOTION ITSELF WE PERCEIVE NOT TWELVE THIS TRAIN THE MEASURE OF OTHER SUCCESSIONS SO THAT TO ME IT SEEMS THAT THE CONSTANT AND REGULAR SUCCESSION OF IDEAS IN A WAKING MAN IS AS IT WERE THE MEASURE AND STANDARD OF ALL OTHER SUCCESSIONS
8575-290349-0026 IN THEIR SUCCESSION THE DURATION OF BUT ONE IDEA OR ELSE WHERE ANY MOTION OR SUCCESSION IS SO SLOW
8575-290349-0027 AS WHEN ANY ONE OR MORE IDEAS IN THEIR ORDINARY COURSE COME INTO OUR MIND BETWEEN THOSE WHICH ARE OFFERED TO THE SIGHT BY THE DIFFERENT PERCEPTIBLE DISTANCES OF A BODY IN MOTION OR BETWEEN SOUNDS OR SMELLS FOLLOWING ONE ANOTHER
8575-290349-0028 IF IT BE SO THAT THE IDEAS OF OUR MINDS WHILST WE HAVE ANY THERE DO CONSTANTLY CHANGE AND SHIFT IN A CONTINUAL SUCCESSION IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE MAY ANY ONE SAY FOR A MAN TO THINK LONG OF ANY ONE THING
8575-290349-0029 AND I WOULD HAVE ANY ONE TRY WHETHER HE CAN KEEP ONE UNVARIED SINGLE IDEA IN HIS MIND WITHOUT ANY OTHER FOR ANY CONSIDERABLE TIME TOGETHER FOURTEEN PROOF
8575-290349-0030 I THINK HE CANNOT THOUGH HE MAY COMMONLY CHOOSE WHETHER HE WILL HEEDFULLY OBSERVE AND CONSIDER THEM SIXTEEN IDEAS HOWEVER MADE INCLUDE NO SENSE OF MOTION WHETHER THESE SEVERAL IDEAS IN A MAN'S MIND BE MADE BY CERTAIN MOTIONS
8575-290349-0031 I WILL NOT HERE DISPUTE BUT THIS I AM SURE THAT THEY INCLUDE NO IDEA OF MOTION IN THEIR APPEARANCE AND IF A MAN HAD NOT THE IDEA OF MOTION OTHERWISE I THINK HE WOULD HAVE NONE AT ALL WHICH IS ENOUGH TO MY PRESENT PURPOSE AND SUFFICIENTLY SHOWS
8575-290349-0032 IS THAT WHICH GIVES US THE IDEA OF SUCCESSION AND DURATION WITHOUT WHICH WE SHOULD HAVE NO SUCH IDEAS AT ALL IT IS NOT THEN MOTION BUT THE CONSTANT TRAIN OF IDEAS IN OUR MINDS WHILST WE ARE WAKING THAT FURNISHES US WITH THE IDEA OF DURATION
8575-290349-0033 OF ANY MOTION AS BY THE TRAIN OF IDEAS CAUSED BY THE UNINTERRUPTED SENSIBLE CHANGE OF DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO BODIES WHICH WE HAVE FROM MOTION
8575-290349-0034 WHEREBY IT MIGHT JUDGE OF ITS DIFFERENT LENGTHS AND CONSIDER THE DISTINCT ORDER WHEREIN SEVERAL THINGS EXIST
8575-290349-0035 THIS CONSIDERATION OF DURATION AS SET OUT BY CERTAIN PERIODS AND MARKED BY CERTAIN MEASURES OR EPOCHS IS THAT I THINK WHICH MOST PROPERLY WE CALL TIME EIGHTEEN A GOOD MEASURE OF TIME MUST DIVIDE ITS WHOLE DURATION INTO EQUAL PERIODS
8575-290349-0036 NOTHING THEN COULD SERVE WELL FOR A CONVENIENT MEASURE OF TIME BUT WHAT HAS DIVIDED THE WHOLE LENGTH OF ITS DURATION INTO APPARENTLY EQUAL PORTIONS BY CONSTANTLY REPEATED PERIODS WHAT PORTIONS OF DURATION ARE NOT DISTINGUISHED OR CONSIDERED AS DISTINGUISHED AND MEASURED
8575-290349-0037 BY SUCH PERIODS COME NOT SO PROPERLY UNDER THE NOTION OF TIME
8575-290349-0038 BEFORE ALL TIME AND WHEN TIME SHALL BE NO MORE NINETEEN THE REVOLUTIONS OF THE SUN AND MOON THE PROPEREST MEASURES OF TIME FOR MANKIND
8575-290349-0039 BUT THE DISTINCTION OF DAYS AND YEARS HAVING DEPENDED ON THE MOTION OF THE SUN IT HAS BROUGHT THIS MISTAKE WITH IT THAT IT HAS BEEN THOUGHT THAT MOTION AND DURATION WERE THE MEASURE ONE OF ANOTHER
8575-290349-0040 ALL WHICH PORTIONS OF TIME WERE MEASURED OUT BY THE MOTION OF THOSE HEAVENLY BODIES
