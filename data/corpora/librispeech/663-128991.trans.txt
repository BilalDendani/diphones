663-128991-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN A PIRATE POTENTATE SOMETIME IN THE LAST HALF OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ON A QUIET FARM IN A SECLUDED PART OF WALES THERE WAS BORN A LITTLE BOY BABY
663-128991-0001 HIS FATHER WAS A FARMER AND HIS MOTHER CHURNED AND TENDED THE COWS AND THE CHICKENS AND THERE WAS NO REASON TO IMAGINE THAT THIS GENTLE LITTLE BABY BORN AND REARED IN THIS RURAL SOLITUDE
663-128991-0002 WOULD BECOME ONE OF THE MOST FORMIDABLE PIRATES THAT THE WORLD EVER KNEW YET SUCH WAS THE CASE THE BABY'S NAME WAS HENRY MORGAN AND AS HE GREW TO BE A BIG BOY
663-128991-0003 SO STRONG WAS HIS DISLIKE THAT WHEN HE BECAME A YOUNG MAN HE RAN AWAY TO THE SEACOAST FOR HE HAD A FANCY TO BE A SAILOR THERE HE FOUND A SHIP BOUND FOR THE WEST INDIES AND IN THIS HE STARTED OUT ON HIS LIFE'S CAREER
663-128991-0004 HE HAD NO MONEY TO PAY HIS PASSAGE AND HE THEREFORE FOLLOWED THE USUAL CUSTOM OF THOSE DAYS AND SOLD HIMSELF FOR A TERM OF THREE YEARS TO AN AGENT WHO WAS TAKING OUT A NUMBER OF MEN TO WORK ON THE PLANTATIONS
663-128991-0005 IN THE PLACES WHERE THESE MEN WERE ENLISTED THEY WERE TERMED SERVANTS BUT WHEN THEY GOT TO THE NEW WORLD THEY WERE GENERALLY CALLED SLAVES AND TREATED AS SUCH
663-128991-0006 WHEN YOUNG MORGAN REACHED THE BARBADOES HE WAS RESOLD TO A PLANTER AND DURING HIS TERM OF SERVICE HE PROBABLY WORKED A GOOD DEAL HARDER AND WAS TREATED MUCH MORE ROUGHLY THAN ANY OF THE LABORERS ON HIS FATHER'S FARM
663-128991-0007 BUT AS SOON AS HE WAS A FREE MAN HE WENT TO JAMAICA AND THERE WERE FEW PLACES IN THE WORLD WHERE A YOUNG MAN COULD BE MORE FREE AND MORE INDEPENDENT THAN IN THIS LAWLESS ISLAND HERE WERE ROLLICKING AND BLUSTERING
663-128991-0008 AND HERE THE YOUNG MAN DETERMINED TO STUDY PIRACY HE WAS NOT A SAILOR AND HUNTER
663-128991-0009 BUT HE DELIBERATELY SELECTED HIS PROFESSION AND IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK TO ACQUIRE A KNOWLEDGE OF ITS PRACTICE THERE WAS A BUCCANEER SHIP ABOUT TO SAIL FROM JAMAICA AND ON THIS MORGAN ENLISTED HE WAS A CLEVER FELLOW
663-128991-0010 NO OTHER BUCCANEERING VESSEL WAS SO WIDELY KNOWN AND SO GREATLY FEARED AND THE ENGLISH PEOPLE IN THESE REGIONS WERE AS PROUD OF THE YOUNG CAPTAIN MORGAN AS IF HE HAD BEEN A REGULARLY COMMISSIONED ADMIRAL CRUISING AGAINST AN ACKNOWLEDGED ENEMY
663-128991-0011 RETURNING FROM ONE OF HIS VOYAGES MORGAN FOUND AN OLD BUCCANEER NAMED MANSVELT IN JAMAICA WHO HAD GATHERED TOGETHER A FLEET OF VESSELS
663-128991-0012 THIS EXPEDITION SEEMED A PROMISING ONE TO MORGAN AND HE JOINED IT BEING ELECTED VICE ADMIRAL OF THE FLEET OF FIFTEEN VESSELS SINCE THE SUCCESSES OF L'OLONNOIS AND OTHERS ATTACKS UPON TOWNS HAD BECOME VERY POPULAR WITH THE BUCCANEERS
663-128991-0013 WHOSE LEADERS WERE GETTING TO BE TIRED OF THE RETAIL BRANCH OF THEIR BUSINESS THAT IS SAILING ABOUT IN ONE SHIP AND CAPTURING SUCH MERCHANTMEN AS IT MIGHT FALL IN WITH MANSVELT'S EXPEDITION TOOK WITH IT NOT ONLY SIX HUNDRED FIGHTING PIRATES BUT ONE WRITING PIRATE
663-128991-0014 FOR JOHN ESQUEMELING ACCOMPANIED IT AND SO FAR AS THE FAME AND REPUTATION OF THESE ADVENTURERS WAS CONCERNED HIS PEN WAS MIGHTIER THAN THEIR SWORDS FOR HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HIS ACCOUNT OF THEIR DEEDS VERY LITTLE ABOUT THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO THE WORLD
663-128991-0015 THE FLEET SAILED DIRECTLY FOR SAINT CATHERINE AN ISLAND NEAR COSTA RICA WHICH WAS STRONGLY FORTIFIED BY THE SPANIARDS AND USED BY THEM AS A STATION FOR AMMUNITION AND SUPPLIES AND ALSO AS A PRISON
663-128991-0016 THEY SWARMED OVER THE WALLS AND CARRIED THE PLACE AT THE EDGE OF THE CUTLASS AND THE MOUTH OF THE PISTOL IN THIS FIERCE FIGHT MORGAN PERFORMED SUCH FEATS OF VALOR THAT EVEN SOME OF THE SPANIARDS WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN PRISONERS WERE FORCED TO PRAISE HIS EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE
663-128991-0017 AND ABILITY AS A LEADER THE BUCCANEERS PROCEEDED TO MAKE VERY GOOD USE OF THEIR VICTORY THEY CAPTURED SOME SMALL ADJOINING ISLANDS AND BROUGHT THE CANNON FROM THEM TO THE MAIN FORTRESS
663-128991-0018 HE DID SO WITH THE IDEA OF FOUNDING THERE A PERMANENT PIRATE PRINCIPALITY THE INHABITANTS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES ENGLISH FRENCH OR DUTCH BUT PLAIN PIRATES HAVING A NATIONALITY AND COUNTRY OF THEIR OWN
663-128991-0019 HAD THE SEED THUS PLANTED BY MANSVELT AND MORGAN GROWN AND MATURED IT IS NOT UNLIKELY THAT THE WHOLE OF THE WEST INDIES MIGHT NOW BE OWNED AND INHABITED BY AN INDEPENDENT NATION WHOSE FOUNDERS WERE THE BOLD BUCCANEERS
663-128991-0020 THE SPANISH GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE HAD HEARD OF THEIR APPROACH AND MET THEM WITH A BODY OF SOLDIERS SO LARGE THAT THEY PRUDENTLY GAVE UP THE ATTEMPT A PROCEEDING NOT VERY COMMON WITH THEM BUT MORGAN WAS NOT ONLY A DARE DEVIL OF A PIRATE
663-128991-0021 BUT A VERY SHREWD WELSHMAN THEY RETURNED TO THE SHIPS AND AFTER TOUCHING AT SAINT CATHERINE
663-128991-0022 THERE WAS PLENTY OF FRESH WATER AND THE GROUND COULD BE CULTIVATED
663-128991-0023 SO THAT HE COULD HOLD THE ISLAND AS A REGULAR STATION FOR THE ASSEMBLING AND FITTING OUT OF PIRATE VESSELS THE PERMANENT PIRATE COLONY NEVER CAME TO ANYTHING NO REENFORCEMENTS WERE SENT MANSVELT DIED
663-128991-0024 AND THE SPANIARDS GATHERED TOGETHER A SUFFICIENT FORCE TO RETAKE THE ISLAND OF SAINT CATHERINE
663-128991-0025 THIS WAS A BLOW TO MORGAN
663-128991-0026 BUT AFTER THE PROJECT FAILED HE SET ABOUT FORMING ANOTHER EXPEDITION HE WAS NOW RECOGNIZED AS BUCCANEER IN CHIEF OF THE WEST INDIES AND HE VERY SOON GATHERED TOGETHER TWELVE SHIPS AND SEVEN HUNDRED MEN EVERYTHING WAS MADE READY TO SAIL
663-128991-0027 AND THE ONLY THING LEFT TO BE DONE WAS TO DECIDE WHAT PARTICULAR PLACE THEY SHOULD FAVOR WITH A VISIT THERE WERE SOME WHO ADVISED AN ATTACK UPON HAVANA GIVING AS A REASON THAT IN THAT CITY THERE WERE A GREAT MANY NUNS MONKS AND PRIESTS
663-128991-0028 AND IF THEY COULD CAPTURE THEM THEY MIGHT ASK AS RANSOM FOR THEM A SUM A GREAT DEAL LARGER THAN THEY COULD EXPECT TO GET FROM THE PILLAGE OF AN ORDINARY TOWN BUT HAVANA WAS CONSIDERED TO BE TOO STRONG A PLACE FOR A PROFITABLE VENTURE
663-128991-0029 AT LAST A DESERTER FROM THE SPANISH ARMY WHO HAD JOINED THEM CAME FORWARD WITH A GOOD IDEA HE TOLD THE PIRATES OF A TOWN IN CUBA TO WHICH HE KNEW THE WAY IT WAS NAMED
663-128991-0030 WHICH HAD BEEN OVERLOOKED BY THE MEN WHO HAD BEEN GATHERING THE CROP WHEN MORGAN'S FLEET ARRIVED AT THE NEAREST HARBOR TO PORT AU PRINCE
663-128991-0031 BUT HE DID NOT SUCCEED IN MAKING A SECRET ATTACK AS HE HAD HOPED ONE OF HIS PRISONERS A SPANIARD LET HIMSELF DROP OVERBOARD AS SOON AS THE VESSELS CAST ANCHOR AND SWIMMING ASHORE
663-128991-0032 WHEN MORGAN CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF THIS BARRICADE HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE SPANIARDS HAD DISCOVERED HIS APPROACH AND SO HE CALLED A HALT HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN OPPOSED TO UNNECESSARY WORK
663-128991-0033 SO HE LEFT THE ROAD MARCHED HIS MEN INTO THE WOODS LED THEM ENTIRELY AROUND THE BARRICADES AND THEN AFTER PROCEEDING A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE EMERGED UPON A WIDE PLAIN WHICH LAY BEFORE THE TOWN
663-128991-0034 HERE HE FOUND THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO FIGHT HIS WAY INTO THE CITY AND PROBABLY MUCH TO HIS SURPRISE HIS MEN WERE PRESENTLY CHARGED BY A BODY OF CAVALRY PIRATES AS A RULE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HORSES EITHER IN PEACE OR WAR
663-128991-0035 AND THE GOVERNOR OF THE TOWN NO DOUBT THOUGHT THAT WHEN HIS WELL ARMED HORSEMEN CHARGED UPON THESE MEN ACCUSTOMED TO FIGHTING ON THE DECKS OF SHIPS AND TOTALLY UNUSED TO CAVALRY COMBATS HE WOULD SOON SCATTER AND DISPERSE THEM BUT PIRATES ARE PECULIAR FIGHTERS
663-128991-0036 IF THEY HAD BEEN ATTACKED FROM ABOVE BY MEANS OF BALLOONS OR FROM BELOW BY MINES AND EXPLOSIVES THEY WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE ADAPTED THEIR STYLE OF DEFENCE TO THE METHOD OF ATTACK THEY ALWAYS DID THIS AND ACCORDING TO ESQUEMELING THEY NEARLY ALWAYS GOT THE BETTER OF THEIR ENEMIES
663-128991-0037 BUT WE MUST REMEMBER THAT IN CASES WHERE THEY DID NOT SUCCEED AS HAPPENED WHEN THEY MARCHED AGAINST THE TOWN OF NATA HE SAYS VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE AFFAIR AND AMPLIFIES ONLY THE ACCOUNTS OF THEIR SUCCESSES BUT THE PIRATES ROUTED THE HORSEMEN
663-128991-0038 AND AFTER A FIGHT OF ABOUT FOUR HOURS THEY ROUTED ALL THE OTHER SPANIARDS WHO RESISTED THEM AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THE TOWN HERE THEY CAPTURED A GREAT MANY PRISONERS WHICH THEY SHUT UP IN THE CHURCHES AND THEN SENT DETACHMENTS OUT INTO THE COUNTRY TO LOOK FOR THOSE WHO HAD RUN AWAY
663-128991-0039 THEN THESE UTTERLY DEBASED AND CRUEL MEN BEGAN THEIR USUAL COURSE AFTER CAPTURING A TOWN THEY PILLAGED FEASTED AND RIOTED THEY GAVE NO THOUGHT TO THE NEEDS OF THE PRISONERS WHOM THEY HAD SHUT UP IN THE CHURCHES MANY OF WHOM STARVED TO DEATH
663-128991-0040 THEY TORTURED THE POOR PEOPLE TO MAKE THEM TELL WHERE THEY HAD HID THEIR TREASURES AND NOTHING WAS TOO VILE OR TOO WICKED FOR THEM TO DO IF THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD PROFIT BY IT THEY HAD COME FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF TAKING EVERYTHING THAT THE PEOPLE POSSESSED
663-128991-0041 ONE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM BEING CARRIED AWAY INTO SLAVERY AND ONE TO KEEP THEIR TOWN FROM BEING BURNED THE SAME PUNISHMENTS WOULD BE INFLICTED UPON THEM FOR TWO WEEKS THE PIRATES WAITED FOR THE UNFORTUNATE CITIZENS TO GO OUT INTO THE COUNTRY
663-128991-0042 AND FIND SOME OF THEIR TOWNSMEN WHO HAD ESCAPED WITH A PORTION OF THEIR TREASURE IN THOSE DAYS PEOPLE DID NOT KEEP THEIR WEALTH IN BANKS AS THEY DO NOW BUT EVERY MAN WAS THE CUSTODIAN OF MOST OF HIS OWN POSSESSIONS AND WHEN THEY FLED FROM THE VISITATION OF AN ENEMY
663-128991-0043 THEY TOOK WITH THEM EVERYTHING OF VALUE THAT THEY COULD CARRY IF THEIR FORTUNES HAD BEEN DEPOSITED IN BANKS IT WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE BEEN MORE CONVENIENT FOR THE PIRATES BEFORE THE CITIZENS RETURNED MORGAN MADE A DISCOVERY
663-128991-0044 A NEGRO WAS CAPTURED WHO CARRIED LETTERS FROM THE GOVERNOR OF SANTIAGO A NEIGHBORING CITY
663-128991-0045 TELLING THEM NOT TO BE IN TOO GREAT A HURRY TO PAY THE RANSOM DEMANDED BY THE PIRATES BECAUSE HE WAS COMING WITH A STRONG FORCE TO THEIR ASSISTANCE WHEN MORGAN READ THESE LETTERS HE CHANGED HIS MIND AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A WISE THING NOT TO STAY IN THAT REGION ANY LONGER THAN COULD BE HELPED
663-128991-0046 SO HE DECIDED NOT TO WAIT FOR THE UNFORTUNATE CITIZENS TO COLLECT THE HEAVY RANSOM HE DEMANDED BUT TOLD THEM THAT IF THEY WOULD FURNISH HIM WITH FIVE HUNDRED HEAD OF CATTLE AND ALSO SUPPLY SALT AND HELP PREPARE THE MEAT FOR SHIPMENT HE WOULD MAKE NO FURTHER DEMANDS UPON THEM
663-128991-0047 ON WHICH HE WISHED TO LAND IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT TAKE AN ACCOUNT OF STOCK AND DIVIDE THE PROFITS THIS THE PIRATES ALWAYS DID AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER THEY HAD CONCLUDED ONE OF THEIR NEFARIOUS ENTERPRISES BUT HIS MEN WERE NOT AT ALL SATISFIED WITH WHAT HAPPENED ON THE ISLAND
663-128991-0048 MORGAN ESTIMATED THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE BOOTY TO BE ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WHEN THIS COMPARATIVELY SMALL SUM WAS DIVIDED MANY OF THE MEN COMPLAINED THAT IT WOULD NOT GIVE THEM ENOUGH TO PAY THEIR DEBTS IN JAMAICA THEY WERE UTTERLY ASTONISHED
663-128991-0049 THAT AFTER HAVING SACKED AN ENTIRELY FRESH TOWN THEY SHOULD HAVE SO LITTLE AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT MANY OF THEM BELIEVED THAT THEIR LEADER WAS A MAN WHO CARRIED ON THE BUSINESS OF PIRACY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENRICHING HIMSELF WHILE HE GAVE HIS FOLLOWERS BARELY ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM QUIET
663-128991-0050 THERE WAS HOWEVER ANOTHER CAUSE OF DISCONTENT AMONG A LARGE BODY OF THE MEN IT APPEARS THAT THE MEN WERE VERY FOND OF MARROW BONES
663-128991-0051 AND TOOK THE MARROW BONES WHICH THEY COOKED AND ATE WHILE THEY WERE FRESH ONE OF THE MEN A FRENCHMAN HAD SELECTED A VERY FINE BONE AND HAD PUT IT BY HIS SIDE WHILE HE WAS PREPARING SOME OTHER TIDBITS WHEN AN ENGLISHMAN CAME ALONG PICKED UP THE BONE
663-128991-0052 AND CARRIED IT AWAY NOW EVEN IN THE CHRONICLES OF MOTHER GOOSE WE ARE TOLD OF THE INTIMATE CONNECTION BETWEEN WELSHMEN THIEVERY AND MARROW BONES FOR TAFFY WAS A WELSHMAN TAFFY WAS A THIEF TAFFY CAME TO MY HOUSE AND STOLE A LEG OF BEEF
663-128991-0053 I WENT TO TAFFY'S HOUSE TAFFY WASN'T HOME TAFFY WENT TO MY HOUSE AND STOLE A MARROW BONE WHAT HAPPENED TO TAFFY WE DO NOT KNOW BUT MORGAN WAS A WELSHMAN MORGAN WAS A THIEF AND ONE OF HIS MEN HAD STOLEN A MARROW BONE THEREFORE CAME TROUBLE
663-128991-0054 THE FRENCHMAN CHALLENGED THE ENGLISHMAN BUT THE LATTER BEING A MEAN SCOUNDREL TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HIS OPPONENT UNFAIRLY STABBED HIM IN THE BACK AND KILLED HIM NOW ALL THE FRENCHMEN IN THE COMPANY ROSE IN FURIOUS PROTEST
663-128991-0055 AND PROMISED THAT HE WOULD TAKE HIM TO JAMAICA AND DELIVER HIM TO JUSTICE BUT THE FRENCHMEN DECLINED TO BE SATISFIED THEY HAD RECEIVED BUT VERY LITTLE MONEY AFTER THEY HAD PILLAGED A RICH TOWN AND THEY BELIEVED THAT THEIR ENGLISH COMPANIONS WERE INCLINED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM IN EVERY WAY
663-128991-0056 AND CONSEQUENTLY THE GREATER PART OF THEM BANDED TOGETHER AND DELIBERATELY DESERTED MORGAN WHO WAS OBLIGED TO GO BACK TO JAMAICA WITH NOT MORE THAN HALF HIS REGULAR FORCES
