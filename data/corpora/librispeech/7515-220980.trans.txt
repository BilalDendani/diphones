7515-220980-0000 THE RIGHT METHOD OF TREATING CRIMINALS QUESTION SHOULD A CRIMINAL BE PUNISHED
7515-220980-0001 THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF RETRIBUTORY PUNISHMENTS ONE IS VENGEANCE THE OTHER CHASTISEMENT MAN HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO TAKE VENGEANCE
7515-220980-0002 BUT THE COMMUNITY HAS THE RIGHT TO PUNISH THE CRIMINAL AND THIS PUNISHMENT IS INTENDED TO WARN AND TO PREVENT SO THAT NO OTHER PERSON WILL DARE TO COMMIT A LIKE CRIME
7515-220980-0003 THIS PUNISHMENT IS FOR THE PROTECTION OF MAN'S RIGHTS BUT IT IS NOT VENGEANCE VENGEANCE APPEASES THE ANGER OF THE HEART BY OPPOSING ONE EVIL TO ANOTHER THIS IS NOT ALLOWABLE
7515-220980-0004 FOR MAN HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO TAKE VENGEANCE BUT IF CRIMINALS WERE ENTIRELY FORGIVEN THE ORDER OF THE WORLD WOULD BE UPSET SO PUNISHMENT IS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL NECESSITIES
7515-220980-0005 THE COMMUNITIES MUST PUNISH THE OPPRESSOR THE MURDERER THE MALEFACTOR SO AS TO WARN AND RESTRAIN OTHERS FROM COMMITTING LIKE CRIMES BUT THE MOST ESSENTIAL THING
7515-220980-0006 IS THAT THE PEOPLE MUST BE EDUCATED IN SUCH A WAY THAT NO CRIMES WILL BE COMMITTED FOR IT IS POSSIBLE TO EDUCATE THE MASSES SO EFFECTIVELY THAT THEY WILL AVOID AND SHRINK FROM PERPETRATING CRIMES
7515-220980-0007 SO THAT THE CRIME ITSELF WILL APPEAR TO THEM AS THE GREATEST CHASTISEMENT THE UTMOST CONDEMNATION AND TORMENT THEREFORE NO CRIMES WHICH REQUIRE PUNISHMENT WILL BE COMMITTED
7515-220980-0008 WE MUST SPEAK OF THINGS THAT ARE FEASIBLE FOR EXAMPLE IF SOMEONE OPPRESSES INJURES AND WRONGS ANOTHER AND THE WRONGED MAN RETALIATES THIS IS VENGEANCE AND IS CENSURABLE
7515-220980-0009 ZAYD HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO KILL THE SON OF AMR IF HE DOES SO THIS IS VENGEANCE IF AMR DISHONORS ZAYD THE LATTER HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO DISHONOR AMR IF HE DOES SO
7515-220980-0010 THIS IS VENGEANCE AND IT IS VERY REPREHENSIBLE NO RATHER HE MUST RETURN GOOD FOR EVIL AND NOT ONLY FORGIVE BUT ALSO IF POSSIBLE BE OF SERVICE TO HIS OPPRESSOR
7515-220980-0011 THIS CONDUCT IS WORTHY OF MAN FOR WHAT ADVANTAGE DOES HE GAIN BY VENGEANCE THE TWO ACTIONS ARE EQUIVALENT IF ONE ACTION IS REPREHENSIBLE BOTH ARE REPREHENSIBLE
7515-220980-0012 THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT ONE WAS COMMITTED FIRST THE OTHER LATER BUT THE COMMUNITY HAS THE RIGHT OF DEFENSE AND OF SELF PROTECTION MOREOVER
7515-220980-0013 THE COMMUNITY HAS NO HATRED NOR ANIMOSITY FOR THE MURDERER IT IMPRISONS OR PUNISHES HIM MERELY FOR THE PROTECTION AND SECURITY OF OTHERS IT IS NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF TAKING VENGEANCE UPON THE MURDERER
7515-220980-0014 BUT FOR THE PURPOSE OF INFLICTING A PUNISHMENT BY WHICH THE COMMUNITY WILL BE PROTECTED IF THE COMMUNITY AND THE INHERITORS OF THE MURDERED ONE WERE TO FORGIVE AND RETURN GOOD FOR EVIL
7515-220980-0015 THE COMMUNITY HAS NO ILL WILL AND RANCOR IN THE INFLICTION OF PUNISHMENT AND IT DOES NOT DESIRE TO APPEASE THE ANGER OF THE HEART ITS PURPOSE IS BY PUNISHMENT TO PROTECT OTHERS
7515-220980-0016 SO ALSO JUSTICE IS ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE LORD THE TENT OF EXISTENCE IS UPHELD UPON THE PILLAR OF JUSTICE AND NOT UPON FORGIVENESS
7515-220980-0017 FOR EXAMPLE IF THE GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE HAD NOT WITHSTOOD THE NOTORIOUS ATTILA HE WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT A SINGLE LIVING MAN SOME PEOPLE ARE LIKE BLOODTHIRSTY WOLVES
7515-220980-0018 IF THEY SEE NO PUNISHMENT FORTHCOMING THEY WILL KILL MEN MERELY FOR PLEASURE AND DIVERSION ONE OF THE TYRANTS OF PERSIA KILLED HIS TUTOR MERELY FOR THE SAKE OF MAKING MERRY FOR MERE FUN AND SPORT
7515-220980-0019 THE ABBASID HAVING SUMMONED HIS MINISTERS COUNCILLORS AND FUNCTIONARIES TO HIS PRESENCE LET LOOSE A BOX FULL OF SCORPIONS IN THE ASSEMBLY
7515-220980-0020 THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMUNITIES DEPENDS UPON JUSTICE NOT UPON FORGIVENESS THEN WHAT CHRIST MEANT BY FORGIVENESS AND PARDON IS NOT THAT
7515-220980-0021 WHEN NATIONS ATTACK YOU BURN YOUR HOMES PLUNDER YOUR GOODS ASSAULT YOUR WIVES CHILDREN AND RELATIVES AND VIOLATE YOUR HONOR YOU SHOULD BE SUBMISSIVE IN THE PRESENCE OF THESE TYRANNICAL FOES
7515-220980-0022 AND ALLOW THEM TO PERFORM ALL THEIR CRUELTIES AND OPPRESSIONS NO THE WORDS OF CHRIST REFER TO THE CONDUCT OF TWO INDIVIDUALS TOWARD EACH OTHER IF ONE PERSON ASSAULTS ANOTHER
7515-220980-0023 THE INJURED ONE SHOULD FORGIVE HIM BUT THE COMMUNITIES MUST PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF MAN SO IF SOMEONE ASSAULTS INJURES OPPRESSES AND WOUNDS ME
7515-220980-0024 I WILL OFFER NO RESISTANCE AND I WILL FORGIVE HIM
7515-220980-0025 ALTHOUGH FOR THE MALEFACTOR NONINTERFERENCE IS APPARENTLY A KINDNESS IT WOULD BE AN OPPRESSION TO MAN SH ADI
7515-220980-0026 IF AT THIS MOMENT A WILD ARAB WERE TO ENTER THIS PLACE WITH A DRAWN SWORD WISHING TO ASSAULT WOUND AND KILL YOU MOST ASSUREDLY I WOULD PREVENT HIM
7515-220980-0027 IF I ABANDONED YOU TO THE ARAB THAT WOULD NOT BE JUSTICE BUT INJUSTICE BUT IF HE INJURE ME PERSONALLY I WOULD FORGIVE HIM ONE THING REMAINS TO BE SAID
7515-220980-0028 IT IS THAT THE COMMUNITIES ARE DAY AND NIGHT OCCUPIED IN MAKING PENAL LAWS AND IN PREPARING AND ORGANIZING INSTRUMENTS AND MEANS OF PUNISHMENT THEY BUILD PRISONS MAKE CHAINS AND FETTERS
7515-220980-0029 ARRANGE PLACES OF EXILE AND BANISHMENT AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF HARDSHIPS AND TORTURES AND THINK BY THESE MEANS TO DISCIPLINE CRIMINALS WHEREAS IN REALITY THEY ARE CAUSING DESTRUCTION OF MORALS
7515-220980-0030 TO CAUSE THEM DAY BY DAY TO PROGRESS AND TO INCREASE IN SCIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE TO ACQUIRE VIRTUES TO GAIN GOOD MORALS AND TO AVOID VICES SO THAT CRIMES MAY NOT OCCUR
7515-220980-0031 AT THE PRESENT TIME THE CONTRARY PREVAILS THE COMMUNITY IS ALWAYS THINKING OF ENFORCING THE PENAL LAWS AND OF PREPARING MEANS OF PUNISHMENT INSTRUMENTS OF DEATH AND CHASTISEMENT
7515-220980-0032 PLACES FOR IMPRISONMENT AND BANISHMENT AND THEY EXPECT CRIMES TO BE COMMITTED THIS HAS A DEMORALIZING EFFECT BUT IF THE COMMUNITY WOULD ENDEAVOR TO EDUCATE THE MASSES
7515-220980-0033 IN ALL THESE CLASSES OF PERFECTIONS THERE WOULD BE PROGRESS AND THERE WOULD BE FEWER CRIMES IT HAS BEEN ASCERTAINED THAT AMONG CIVILIZED PEOPLES CRIME
7515-220980-0034 IS LESS FREQUENT THAN AMONG UNCIVILIZED THAT IS TO SAY AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE ACQUIRED THE TRUE CIVILIZATION WHICH IS DIVINE CIVILIZATION
7515-220980-0035 CONSIDER HOW OFTEN MURDER OCCURS AMONG THE BARBARIANS OF AFRICA THEY EVEN KILL ONE ANOTHER IN ORDER TO EAT EACH OTHER'S FLESH AND BLOOD
