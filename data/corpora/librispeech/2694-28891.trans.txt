2694-28891-0000 DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO THE SHOOTING WENT ON WITHOUT MUCH INTERRUPTION FROM LOVE MAKING THE LOVE MAKING WAS NOT PROSPEROUS ALL ROUND POOR LADY MARY HAD NOTHING TO COMFORT HER
2694-28891-0001 COULD SHE HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO SEE THE LETTER WHICH HER LOVER HAD WRITTEN TO HER FATHER THE COMFORT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF NOT AMPLE STILL VERY GREAT MARY TOLD HERSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT SHE WAS QUITE SURE OF TREGEAR
2694-28891-0002 BUT IT WAS HARD UPON HER THAT SHE COULD NOT BE MADE CERTAIN THAT HER CERTAINTY WAS WELL GROUNDED HAD SHE KNOWN THAT TREGEAR HAD WRITTEN THOUGH SHE HAD NOT SEEN A WORD OF HIS LETTER IT WOULD HAVE COMFORTED HER BUT SHE HAD HEARD NOTHING OF THE LETTER
2694-28891-0003 IN JUNE LAST SHE HAD SEEN HIM BY CHANCE FOR A FEW MINUTES IN LADY MABEL'S DRAWING ROOM SINCE THAT SHE HAD NOT HEARD FROM HIM OR OF HIM THAT WAS NOW MORE THAN FIVE MONTHS SINCE HOW COULD HER LOVE SERVE HER
2694-28891-0004 HOW COULD HER VERY LIFE SERVE HER IF THINGS WERE TO GO ON LIKE THAT HOW WAS SHE TO BEAR IT THINKING OF THIS SHE RESOLVED SHE ALMOST RESOLVED THAT SHE WOULD GO BOLDLY TO HER FATHER AND DESIRE THAT SHE MIGHT BE GIVEN UP TO HER LOVER
2694-28891-0005 HER BROTHER THOUGH MORE TRIUMPHANT FOR HOW COULD HE FAIL TO TRIUMPH AFTER SUCH WORDS AS ISABEL HAD SPOKEN TO HIM STILL FELT HIS DIFFICULTIES VERY SERIOUSLY SHE HAD IMBUED HIM WITH A STRONG SENSE OF HER OWN FIRMNESS
2694-28891-0006 AND SHE HAD DECLARED THAT SHE WOULD GO AWAY AND LEAVE HIM ALTOGETHER IF THE DUKE SHOULD BE UNWILLING TO RECEIVE HER HE KNEW THAT THE DUKE WOULD BE UNWILLING THE DUKE WHO CERTAINLY WAS NOT HANDY IN THOSE DUTIES OF MATCH MAKING
2694-28891-0007 WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE FALLEN UPON HIM AT THE DEATH OF HIS WIFE SHOWED BY A HUNDRED LITTLE SIGNS HIS ANXIETY THAT HIS SON AND HEIR SHOULD ARRANGE HIS AFFAIRS WITH LADY MABEL THESE SIGNS WERE MANIFEST TO MARY
2694-28891-0008 WERE DISAGREEABLY MANIFEST TO SILVERBRIDGE WERE UNFORTUNATELY MANIFEST TO LADY MABEL HERSELF THEY WERE MANIFEST TO MISSUS FINN WHO WAS CLEVER ENOUGH TO PERCEIVE THAT THE INCLINATIONS OF THE YOUNG HEIR WERE TURNED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION
2694-28891-0009 AND GRADUALLY THEY BECAME MANIFEST TO ISABEL BONCASSEN THE HOST HIMSELF AS HOST WAS COURTEOUS TO ALL HIS GUESTS THEY HAD BEEN OF HIS OWN SELECTION
2694-28891-0010 BUT HE SELECTED TWO FOR HIS PECULIAR NOTICE AND THOSE TWO WERE MISS BONCASSEN AND LADY MABEL WHILE HE WOULD HIMSELF WALK AND TALK AND ARGUE AFTER HIS OWN PECULIAR FASHION WITH THE AMERICAN BEAUTY
2694-28891-0011 EXPLAINING TO HER MATTERS POLITICAL AND SOCIAL TILL HE PERSUADED HER TO PROMISE TO READ HIS PAMPHLET UPON DECIMAL COINAGE HE WAS ALWAYS MAKING AWKWARD EFFORTS TO THROW SILVERBRIDGE AND LADY MABEL TOGETHER
2694-28891-0012 AND KNEW WELL HOW THE MATTER WAS KNEW THAT THEY WERE RIVALS AND KNEW EACH THE GROUND ON WHICH SHE HERSELF AND ON WHICH THE OTHER STOOD BUT NEITHER WAS SATISFIED WITH HER ADVANTAGE OR NEARLY SATISFIED
2694-28891-0013 ISABEL WOULD NOT TAKE THE PRIZE WITHOUT THE DUKE'S CONSENT AND MABEL COULD NOT HAVE IT WITHOUT THAT OTHER CONSENT
2694-28891-0014 THERE IS THE DUKE HIMSELF I NEVER SAW A MAN MORE ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE BUT I DO NOT WANT TO MARRY AN ENGLISH DUKE SAID ISABEL AND I PITY ANY GIRL WHO HAS ANY IDEA OF MARRIAGE
2694-28891-0015 EXCEPT THAT WHICH COMES FROM A WISH TO GIVE BACK LOVE FOR LOVE THROUGH IT ALL THE FATHER NEVER SUSPECTED THE REAL STATE OF HIS SON'S MIND HE WAS TOO SIMPLE TO THINK IT POSSIBLE THAT THE PURPOSE WHICH SILVERBRIDGE HAD DECLARED TO HIM
2694-28891-0016 AS THEY WALKED TOGETHER FROM THE BEARGARDEN HAD ALREADY BEEN THROWN TO THE WINDS HE DID NOT LIKE TO ASK WHY THE THING WAS NOT SETTLED YOUNG MEN HE THOUGHT WERE SOMETIMES SHY AND YOUNG LADIES NOT ALWAYS READY TO GIVE IMMEDIATE ENCOURAGEMENT
2694-28891-0017 BUT WHEN HE SAW THEM TOGETHER HE CONCLUDED THAT MATTERS WERE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IT WAS HOWEVER AN OPINION WHICH HE HAD ALL TO HIMSELF DURING THE THREE OR FOUR DAYS WHICH FOLLOWED THE SCENE IN THE BILLIARD ROOM
2694-28891-0018 ISABEL KEPT HERSELF OUT OF HER LOVER'S WAY SHE HAD EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT WHICH SHE WISHED HIM TO DO
2694-28891-0019 AND KNEW THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN DONE SHE WAS SURE THAT IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DONE WHILE THE DUKE WAS EXPLAINING TO HER THE BEAUTY OF QUINTS AND EXPATIATING ON THE HORRORS OF TWELVE PENNIES AND TWELVE INCHES AND TWELVE OUNCES
2694-28891-0020 VARIEGATED IN SOME MATTERS BY SIXTEEN AND FOURTEEN HE COULD NOT KNOW THAT SHE WAS AMBITIOUS OF BECOMING HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW WHILE HE WAS OPENING OUT TO HER THE MYSTERIES OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS
2694-28891-0021 AND EXPLAINING HOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT WHILE HE WAS A MEMBER OF ONE HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT HIS SON SHOULD BE SITTING AS A MEMBER OF ANOTHER HOW IT WAS THAT A NOBLEMAN COULD BE A COMMONER AND HOW A PEER OF ONE PART OF THE EMPIRE
2694-28891-0022 COULD SIT AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A BOROUGH IN ANOTHER PART SHE WAS AN APT SCHOLAR HAD THERE BEEN A QUESTION OF ANY OTHER YOUNG MAN MARRYING HER HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE THOUGHT THAT NO OTHER YOUNG MAN COULD HAVE DONE BETTER
2694-28891-0023 SILVERBRIDGE WAS DISCONTENTED WITH HIMSELF THE GREATEST MISFORTUNE WAS THAT LADY MABEL SHOULD BE THERE WHILE SHE WAS PRESENT TO HIS FATHER'S EYES HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO DECLARE HIS ALTERED WISHES
2694-28891-0024 EVERY NOW AND THEN SHE WOULD SAY TO HIM SOME LITTLE WORD INDICATING HER FEELINGS OF THE ABSURDITY OF HIS PASSION I DECLARE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT IS YOU OR YOUR FATHER THAT MISS BONCASSEN MOST AFFECTS SHE SAID
2694-28891-0025 BUT TO THIS AND TO OTHER SIMILAR SPEECHES HE WOULD MAKE NO ANSWER
2694-28891-0026 AND MIGHT USE IT AGAINST HIM IF SHE PLEASED IN HIS PRESENT FRAME OF MIND HE WAS NOT DISPOSED TO JOKE WITH HER UPON THE SUBJECT ON THAT SECOND SUNDAY THE BONCASSENS WERE TO RETURN TO LONDON ON THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY
2694-28891-0027 HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE WITH ISABEL'S FATHER THE AMERICAN HAD BEEN BROUGHT OUT AT HIS OWN REQUEST TO SEE THE STABLES AND HAD BEEN ACCOMPANIED ROUND THE PREMISES BY SILVERBRIDGE AND BY MISTER WARBURTON BY ISABEL AND BY LADY MARY
2694-28891-0028 AS THEY GOT OUT INTO THE PARK THE PARTY WERE DIVIDED AND SILVERBRIDGE FOUND HIMSELF WITH MISTER BONCASSEN THEN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE PROPER THING FOR A YOUNG MAN IN LOVE WAS TO GO NOT TO HIS OWN FATHER BUT TO THE LADY'S FATHER
2694-28891-0029 ISABEL NO DOUBT HAD SUGGESTED A DIFFERENT COURSE BUT THAT WHICH ISABEL HAD SUGGESTED WAS AT THE PRESENT MOMENT IMPOSSIBLE TO HIM NOW AT THIS INSTANT WITHOUT A MOMENT'S FORETHOUGHT HE DETERMINED TO TELL HIS STORY TO ISABEL'S FATHER
2694-28891-0030 AS ANY OTHER LOVER MIGHT TELL IT TO ANY OTHER FATHER I AM VERY GLAD TO FIND OURSELVES ALONE MISTER BONCASSEN HE SAID MISTER BONCASSEN BOWED AND SHOWED HIMSELF PREPARED TO LISTEN THOUGH SO MANY AT MATCHING HAD SEEN THE WHOLE PLAY
2694-28891-0031 MISTER BONCASSEN HAD SEEN NOTHING OF IT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE AWARE OF WHAT I HAVE GOT TO SAY I CANNOT QUITE SAY THAT I AM MY LORD BUT WHATEVER IT IS I AM SURE I SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO HEAR IT
2694-28891-0032 I WANT TO MARRY YOUR DAUGHTER SAID SILVERBRIDGE ISABEL HAD TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS DOWNRIGHT AND IN SUCH A MATTER HE HAD HARDLY AS YET LEARNED HOW TO EXPRESS HIMSELF WITH THOSE PARAPHRASES IN WHICH THE WORLD DELIGHTS
2694-28891-0033 MISTER BONCASSEN STOOD STOCK STILL AND IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE MOMENT PULLED OFF HIS HAT THE PROPER THING IS TO ASK YOUR PERMISSION TO GO ON WITH IT YOU WANT TO MARRY MY DAUGHTER
2694-28891-0034 YES THAT IS WHAT I HAVE GOT TO SAY IS SHE AWARE OF YOUR INTENTION QUITE AWARE I BELIEVE I MAY SAY THAT IF OTHER THINGS GO STRAIGHT SHE WILL CONSENT AND YOUR FATHER THE DUKE
2694-28891-0035 HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT AS YET REALLY THIS TAKES ME QUITE BY SURPRISE I AM AFRAID YOU HAVE NOT GIVEN ENOUGH THOUGHT TO THE MATTER I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS SAID LORD SILVERBRIDGE
2694-28891-0036 MARRIAGE IS A VERY SERIOUS THING OF COURSE IT IS AND MEN GENERALLY LIKE TO MARRY THEIR EQUALS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT I DON'T THINK THAT COUNTS FOR MUCH
2694-28891-0037 PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHO ARE THEIR EQUALS THAT IS QUITE TRUE IF I WERE SPEAKING TO YOU OR TO YOUR FATHER THEORETICALLY I SHOULD PERHAPS BE UNWILLING TO ADMIT SUPERIORITY ON YOUR SIDE BECAUSE OF YOUR RANK AND WEALTH
2694-28891-0038 I COULD MAKE AN ARGUMENT IN FAVOUR OF ANY EQUALITY WITH THE BEST BRITON THAT EVER LIVED AS WOULD BECOME A TRUE BORN REPUBLICAN THAT IS JUST WHAT I MEAN BUT WHEN THE QUESTION BECOMES ONE OF PRACTISING
2694-28891-0039 A QUESTION FOR OUR LIVES FOR OUR HAPPINESS FOR OUR OWN CONDUCT THEN KNOWING WHAT MUST BE THE FEELINGS OF AN ARISTOCRACY IN SUCH A COUNTRY AS THIS I AM PREPARED TO ADMIT THAT YOUR FATHER WOULD BE AS WELL JUSTIFIED
2694-28891-0040 IN OBJECTING TO A MARRIAGE BETWEEN A CHILD OF HIS AND A CHILD OF MINE AS I SHOULD BE IN OBJECTING TO ONE BETWEEN MY CHILD AND THE SON OF SOME MECHANIC IN OUR NATIVE CITY HE WOULDN'T BE A GENTLEMAN SAID SILVERBRIDGE
2694-28891-0041 THAT IS A WORD OF WHICH I DON'T QUITE KNOW THE MEANING I DO SAID SILVERBRIDGE CONFIDENTLY BUT YOU COULD NOT DEFINE IT IF A MAN BE WELL EDUCATED AND CAN KEEP A GOOD HOUSE OVER HIS HEAD
2694-28891-0042 PERHAPS YOU MAY CALL HIM A GENTLEMAN BUT THERE ARE MANY SUCH WITH WHOM YOUR FATHER WOULD NOT WISH TO BE SO CLOSELY CONNECTED AS YOU PROPOSE BUT I MAY HAVE YOUR SANCTION MISTER BONCASSEN AGAIN TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND WALKED ALONG THOUGHTFULLY
2694-28891-0043 I HOPE YOU DON'T OBJECT TO ME PERSONALLY MY DEAR YOUNG LORD YOUR FATHER HAS GONE OUT OF HIS WAY TO BE CIVIL TO ME AM I TO RETURN HIS COURTESY BY BRINGING A GREAT TROUBLE UPON HIM HE SEEMS TO BE VERY FOND OF MISS BONCASSEN
2694-28891-0044 WILL HE CONTINUE TO BE FOND OF HER WHEN HE HAS HEARD THIS WHAT DOES ISABEL SAY SHE SAYS THE SAME AS YOU OF COURSE WHY OF COURSE
2694-28891-0045 EXCEPT THAT IT IS EVIDENT TO YOU AS IT IS TO ME THAT SHE COULD NOT WITH PROPRIETY SAY ANYTHING ELSE I THINK SHE WOULD WOULD LIKE IT YOU KNOW SHE WOULD LIKE TO BE YOUR WIFE
2694-28891-0046 WELL YES IF IT WERE ALL SERENE I THINK SHE WOULD CONSENT I DARE SAY SHE WOULD CONSENT IF IT WERE ALL SERENE WHY SHOULD SHE NOT DO NOT TRY HER TOO HARD LORD SILVERBRIDGE YOU SAY YOU LOVE HER
2694-28891-0047 I DO INDEED THEN THINK OF THE POSITION IN WHICH YOU ARE PLACING HER YOU ARE STRUGGLING TO WIN HER HEART SILVERBRIDGE AS HE HEARD THIS ASSURED HIMSELF THAT THERE WAS NO NEED FOR ANY FURTHER STRUGGLING IN THAT DIRECTION
2694-28891-0048 PERHAPS YOU HAVE WON IT YET SHE MAY FEEL THAT SHE CANNOT BECOME YOUR WIFE SHE MAY WELL SAY TO HERSELF THAT THIS WHICH IS OFFERED TO HER IS SO GREAT THAT SHE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE IT
2694-28891-0049 AND MAY YET HAVE TO SAY AT THE SAME TIME THAT SHE CANNOT ACCEPT IT WITHOUT DISGRACE YOU WOULD NOT PUT ONE THAT YOU LOVE INTO SUCH A POSITION AS FOR DISGRACE THAT IS NONSENSE I BEG YOUR PARDON MISTER BONCASSEN
2694-28891-0050 WOULD IT BE NO DISGRACE THAT SHE SHOULD BE KNOWN HERE IN ENGLAND TO BE YOUR WIFE AND THAT NONE OF THOSE OF YOUR RANK OF WHAT WOULD THEN BE HER OWN RANK SHOULD WELCOME HER INTO HER NEW WORLD THAT WOULD BE OUT OF THE QUESTION
2694-28891-0051 IF YOUR OWN FATHER REFUSED TO WELCOME HER WOULD NOT OTHERS FOLLOW SUIT YOU DON'T KNOW MY FATHER YOU SEEM TO KNOW HIM WELL ENOUGH TO FEAR THAT HE WOULD OBJECT YES THAT IS TRUE
2694-28891-0052 WHAT MORE DO I WANT TO KNOW IF SHE WERE ONCE MY WIFE HE WOULD NOT REJECT HER OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS HE IS IN TRUTH THE KINDEST AND MOST AFFECTIONATE AND THEREFORE YOU WOULD TRY HIM AFTER THIS FASHION
2694-28891-0053 NO MY LORD I CANNOT SEE MY WAY THROUGH THESE DIFFICULTIES YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU PLEASE TO HIM AS TO YOUR OWN WISHES BUT YOU MUST NOT TELL HIM THAT YOU HAVE ANY SANCTION FROM ME THAT EVENING THE STORY WAS TOLD TO MISSUS BONCASSEN
2694-28891-0054 AND THE MATTER WAS DISCUSSED AMONG THE FAMILY ISABEL IN TALKING TO THEM MADE NO SCRUPLE OF DECLARING HER OWN FEELINGS AND THOUGH IN SPEAKING TO LORD SILVERBRIDGE SHE HAD SPOKEN VERY MUCH AS HER FATHER HAD DONE AFTERWARDS
2694-28891-0055 YET IN THIS FAMILY CONCLAVE SHE TOOK HER LOVER'S PART THAT IS ALL VERY WELL FATHER SHE SAID I TOLD HIM THE SAME THING MYSELF BUT IF HE IS MAN ENOUGH TO BE FIRM I SHALL NOT THROW HIM OVER NOT FOR ALL THE DUKES IN EUROPE
2694-28891-0056 I SHALL NOT STAY HERE TO BE POINTED AT I WILL GO BACK HOME IF HE FOLLOWS ME THEN I SHALL CHOOSE TO FORGET ALL ABOUT HIS RANK IF HE LOVES ME WELL ENOUGH TO SHOW THAT HE IS IN EARNEST I SHALL NOT DISAPPOINT HIM FOR THE SAKE OF PLEASING HIS FATHER
2694-28891-0057 TO THIS NEITHER MISTER NOR MISSUS BONCASSEN WAS ABLE TO MAKE ANY EFFICIENT ANSWER MISSUS BONCASSEN DEAR GOOD WOMAN COULD SEE NO REASON WHY TWO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO LOVED EACH OTHER SHOULD NOT BE MARRIED AT ONCE
2694-28891-0058 DUKES AND DUCHESSES WERE NOTHING TO HER IF THEY COULDN'T BE HAPPY IN ENGLAND THEN LET THEM COME AND LIVE IN NEW YORK SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT ANYBODY COULD BE TOO GOOD FOR HER DAUGHTER WAS THERE NOT AN IDEA THAT MISTER BONCASSEN WOULD BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT
2694-28891-0059 AND WAS NOT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AS GOOD AS THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND LORD SILVERBRIDGE WHEN HE LEFT MISTER BONCASSEN WANDERED ABOUT THE PARK BY HIMSELF KING COPHETUA MARRIED THE BEGGAR'S DAUGHTER
2694-28891-0060 HE WAS SURE OF THAT KING COPHETUA PROBABLY HAD NOT A FATHER AND THE BEGGAR PROBABLY WAS NOT HIGH MINDED BUT THE DISCREPANCY IN THAT CASE WAS MUCH GREATER HE INTENDED TO PERSEVERE
2694-28891-0061 TRUSTING MUCH TO A BELIEF THAT WHEN ONCE HE WAS MARRIED HIS FATHER WOULD COME ROUND HIS FATHER ALWAYS DID COME ROUND BUT THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE IMPOSSIBLE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE SHOULD ASK HIS FATHER'S CONSENT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
2694-28891-0062 LADY MABEL'S PRESENCE IN THE HOUSE WAS AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD DO IT IF HE AND HIS FATHER WERE ALONE TOGETHER OR COMPARATIVELY ALONE HE MUST BE PREPARED FOR AN OPPOSITION AT ANY RATE OF SOME DAYS
2694-28891-0063 WHICH OPPOSITION WOULD MAKE HIS FATHER QUITE UNABLE TO ENTERTAIN HIS GUESTS WHILE IT LASTED BUT AS HE COULD NOT DECLARE HIS WISHES TO HIS FATHER
2694-28891-0064 HE MUST EXPLAIN THE DIFFICULTY TO HER HE FELT ALREADY THAT SHE WOULD DESPISE HIM FOR HIS COWARDICE THAT SHE WOULD NOT PERCEIVE THE DIFFICULTIES IN HIS WAY OR UNDERSTAND THAT HE MIGHT INJURE HIS CAUSE BY PRECIPITATION
2694-28891-0065 THEN HE CONSIDERED WHETHER HE MIGHT NOT POSSIBLY MAKE SOME BARGAIN WITH HIS FATHER HOW WOULD IT BE IF HE SHOULD CONSENT TO GO BACK TO THE LIBERAL PARTY ON BEING ALLOWED TO MARRY THE GIRL HE LOVED AS FAR AS HIS POLITICAL FEELINGS WERE CONCERNED
2694-28891-0066 HE DID NOT THINK THAT HE WOULD MUCH OBJECT TO MAKE THE CHANGE THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING CERTAIN THAT HE MUST EXPLAIN HIS CONDITION TO MISS BONCASSEN BEFORE SHE WENT HE FOUND NO DIFFICULTY NOW IN GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY
2694-28891-0067 SHE WAS EQUALLY ANXIOUS AND AS WELL DISPOSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HER ANXIETY AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM SHE WAS NOT DESIROUS OF PRETENDING THAT THE MATTER WAS ONE OF SMALL MOMENT TO HERSELF SHE HAD TOLD HIM
2694-28891-0068 THAT IT WAS ALL THE WORLD TO HER AND HAD BEGGED HIM TO LET HER KNOW HER FATE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ON THAT LAST MONDAY MORNING THEY WERE IN THE GROUNDS TOGETHER AND LADY MABEL WHO WAS WALKING WITH MISSUS FINN
2694-28891-0069 SAW THEM PASS THROUGH A LITTLE GATE WHICH LED FROM THE GARDENS INTO THE PRIORY RUINS IT ALL MEANS NOTHING MABEL SAID WITH A LITTLE LAUGH TO HER COMPANION IF SO I AM SORRY FOR THE YOUNG LADY SAID MISSUS FINN
2694-28891-0070 DON'T YOU THINK THAT ONE ALWAYS HAS TO BE SORRY FOR THE YOUNG LADIES YOUNG LADIES GENERALLY HAVE A BAD TIME OF IT
2694-28891-0071 BUT IT WOULD ALWAYS COME BACK UPON HIM THAT GENTLEMAN I BELIEVE NEVER SUCCEEDED SAID MISSUS FINN THE YOUNG LADIES I SUPPOSE DO SOMETIMES IN THE MEANTIME ISABEL AND SILVERBRIDGE WERE AMONG THE RUINS TOGETHER
2694-28891-0072 THIS IS WHERE THE OLD PALLISERS USED TO BE BURIED HE SAID OH INDEED AND MARRIED I SUPPOSE I DARE SAY THEY HAD A PRIEST OF THEIR OWN NO DOUBT WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN CONVENIENT
2694-28891-0073 THIS BLOCK OF A FELLOW WITHOUT ANY LEGS LEFT IS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT SIR GUY HE RAN AWAY WITH HALF A DOZEN HEIRESSES THEY SAY I WISH THINGS WERE AS EASILY DONE NOW NOBODY SHOULD HAVE RUN AWAY WITH ME
2694-28891-0074 I HAVE NO IDEA OF GOING ON SUCH A JOURNEY EXCEPT ON TERMS OF EQUALITY JUST STEP AND STEP ALIKE THEN SHE TOOK HOLD OF HIS ARM AND PUT OUT ONE FOOT ARE YOU READY I AM VERY WILLING
2694-28891-0075 BUT ARE YOU READY FOR A STRAIGHTFORWARD WALK OFF TO CHURCH BEFORE ALL THE WORLD NONE OF YOUR PRIVATE CHAPLAINS SUCH AS SIR GUY HAD AT HIS COMMAND JUST THE REGISTRAR IF THERE IS NOTHING BETTER SO THAT IT BE PUBLIC BEFORE ALL THE WORLD
2694-28891-0076 I WISH WE COULD START THIS INSTANT BUT WE CAN'T CAN WE NO DEAR SO MANY THINGS HAVE TO BE SETTLED AND WHAT HAVE YOU SETTLED ON SINCE YOU LAST SPOKE TO ME I HAVE TOLD YOUR FATHER EVERYTHING
2694-28891-0077 YES I KNOW THAT WHAT GOOD DOES THAT DO FATHER IS NOT A DUKE OF OMNIUM NO ONE SUPPOSED THAT HE WOULD OBJECT BUT HE DID SAID SILVERBRIDGE YES AS I DO FOR THE SAME REASON
2694-28891-0078 BUT TO YOUR OWN FATHER YOU HAVE NOT VENTURED TO SPEAK THEN HE TOLD HIS STORY AS BEST HE KNEW HOW IT WAS NOT THAT HE FEARED HIS FATHER BUT THAT HE FELT THAT THE PRESENT MOMENT WAS NOT FIT
2694-28891-0079 HE WISHES YOU TO MARRY THAT LADY MABEL GREX SHE SAID HE NODDED HIS HEAD
2694-28891-0080 NEVER I MIGHT HAVE DONE SO HAD I NOT SEEN YOU I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO IF SHE HAD BEEN WILLING BUT NOW I NEVER CAN NEVER NEVER HER HAND HAD DROPPED FROM HIS ARM
2694-28891-0081 BUT NOW SHE PUT IT UP AGAIN FOR A MOMENT SO THAT HE MIGHT FEEL THE PRESSURE OF HER FINGERS
2694-28891-0082 I THINK YOU DO I AM SURE I HOPE YOU DO
2694-28891-0083 WITH ALL MY HEART I DO THEN I AM AS PROUD AS A QUEEN
2694-28891-0084 AS SOON AS YOU ARE GONE AS SOON AS WE ARE ALONE TOGETHER I WILL AND THEN I WILL FOLLOW YOU TO LONDON NOW SHALL WE NOT SAY GOOD BYE GOOD BYE MY OWN SHE WHISPERED
2694-28891-0085 HER HAND WAS IN HIS AND SHE LOOKED ABOUT AS THOUGH TO SEE THAT NO EYES WERE WATCHING THEM BUT THEN AS THE THOUGHTS CAME RUSHING TO HER MIND SHE CHANGED HER PURPOSE
