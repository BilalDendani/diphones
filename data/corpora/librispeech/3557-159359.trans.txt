3557-159359-0000 IF HE COULD FIND SUCH A PARAGON HE WOULD MARRY HER THERE WERE MANY BEAUTIFUL MAIDENS IN THE LAND BUT THEY WERE NOT THE CLEVEREST THERE WERE ALSO MANY MAIDENS WHO WERE CLEVER ENOUGH BUT THEY WERE NOT THE FAIREST THIS MUCH IS CERTAIN
3557-159359-0001 HALF ENOUGH GOOD LOOKS AND WIT TO SUIT HIM HE WAS NOW OF AN AGE WHEN HE AND HIS FATHER THE KING AND THEIR FAITHFUL SUBJECTS WERE ALL OF OPINION THAT HE OUGHT TO GET MARRIED BUT AS WE HAVE SEEN
3557-159359-0002 HIS ADDRESSES SO HE DETERMINED TO JOURNEY TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND TO TRAVEL INCOGNITO AND UNATTENDED
3557-159359-0003 HE TRAVELED FAR AND WIDE FROM ONE LAND TO ANOTHER BUT IT FARED WITH HIM ABROAD AS IT HAD FARED WITH HIM AT HOME
3557-159359-0004 HE RODE AND RODE STILL HE COULD NOT GET TO THE END OF THE FOREST NOONDAY CAME
3557-159359-0005 HE HAD NO IDEA WHERE HE WAS
3557-159359-0006 AND THEY WERE BOTH TIRED OUT AT LAST HE SAW A SMALL CLOUD OF BLUE SMOKE RISING AMID THE GREEN TREES AND RIDING TOWARD IT HE SOON CAME TO A LITTLE COTTAGE VERY POOR AND MEAN LOOKING
3557-159359-0007 BUT HE WAS GLAD ENOUGH FOR HERE AT LEAST HE SHOULD FIND SOMEBODY
3557-159359-0008 THEY APPEARED VERY MUCH ASTONISHED TO SEE SUCH A FINE HANDSOME YOUNG KNIGHT THE PRINCE AFTER WISHING THEM GOOD EVENING
3557-159359-0009 BUT WHEN HE TOLD THEM THAT NEITHER HE NOR HIS HORSE COULD HOLD OUT ANY LONGER SO GREATLY DID THEY NEED REST AND A NIGHT'S LODGING
3557-159359-0010 HIS FIRST CARE WAS FOR HIS HORSE STABLE THERE WAS NONE BUT THERE WAS A BIT OF A SHED FOR THE OLD PEOPLE'S COW
3557-159359-0011 TIRED BEAST THEN HE WENT INTO THE COTTAGE WHICH CONSISTED OF ONE LITTLE ROOM WHICH WAS BOTH DARK AND LOW HE SAT DOWN ON A WOODEN BENCH AND BEGAN TO TALK TO THE OLD PEOPLE
3557-159359-0012 DID THEY LIVE HERE ALL ALONE IN THE WILD WOOD YES THE OLD FOLK SAID THEY DID
3557-159359-0013 THEY GOT ON AS BEST THEY COULD
3557-159359-0014 THEN THE PRINCE HAD HIS SUPPER THE BEST THE HOUSE COULD AFFORD A CRUST OF DRY BREAD AND A BOWL OF MILK THE OLD FOLK THEN FETCHED A WISP OF STRAW
3557-159359-0015 INTENDING TO LIE UPON IT THEY HAD BUT ONE BED AND THEY MEANT TO GIVE IT UP TO THEIR GRAND GUEST BUT THE PRINCE WOULD NOT HEAR OF SUCH A THING
3557-159359-0016 AND HE WOULD LIE ON THE BUNDLE OF STRAW THAT WAS SPREAD UPON THE FLOOR
3557-159359-0017 BUT HE WAS THOROUGHLY TIRED OUT SO HE SOON FELL ASLEEP
3557-159359-0018 THEN HE AWOKE AND STIFF ENOUGH HE WAS IN ALL HIS LIMBS FROM LYING ON SO HARD A BED
3557-159359-0019 MIGHT BE RATS OR MICE OR PERHAPS A CAT YES IT WAS CERTAINLY A CAT
3557-159359-0020 EXACTLY LIKE A SPINNING WHEEL THEN HE HEARD SINGING THAT COULD NOT BE THE CAT NOR WAS IT THE SONG OF
3557-159359-0021 SO SWEET A SONG HE HAD NEVER HEARD BEFORE HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET RUBBED HIS EYES
3557-159359-0022 AND THE OLD PEOPLE PERSISTED
3557-159359-0023 THAT THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE HOUSE BUT THEMSELVES NAY
3557-159359-0024 I PREFER BELIEVING WHAT I HAVE HEARD WITH MY OWN EARS AND YOU MAY AS WELL TELL ME THE PLAIN TRUTH FOR I AM DETERMINED TO LEARN IT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SO THEN THE OLD MAN MADE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT
3557-159359-0025 THE PRINCE WAS QUITE RIGHT THERE WAS SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE HOUSE IT WAS THEIR DAUGHTER
3557-159359-0026 OLD AND FEEBLE AS THEY WERE SHE EARNED A FEW PENCE BY HER SPINNING AND WEAVING
3557-159359-0027 NOR WOMAN EATER EITHER SO FAR AS HE KNEW
3557-159359-0028 AND SHE CAME RUNNING DOWN TRIPPING ALONG CLAD IN MEAN ATTIRE SO BLITHE AND FRESH AND FAIR
3557-159359-0029 NEVER HAD HE SEEN ANYTHING HALF SO LOVELY AS SHE WAS HE WAS UTTERLY AT A LOSS WHAT TO SAY OR DO
3557-159359-0030 HE MIGHT NOT EVEN DREAM OF MAKING HIS WIFE SO HE TURNED RESOLUTELY AWAY
3557-159359-0031 GETTING HIS HORSE READY TO START AND WOULD NOT SO MUCH AS ALLOW HIMSELF TO LOOK AT HER AGAIN BUT WHEN HE WAS IN THE SADDLE JUST SETTING OFF AS HE NODDED GOOD BY TO THE OLD FOLK
3557-159359-0032 AND WHO NOW WERE BOWING AND SCRAPING BEFORE HIM HE COULD NOT HELP GIVING A SIDE GLANCE TO WHERE SHE STOOD GAZING AT HIM WITH LOVELY
3557-159359-0033 FAREWELL AND AS SHE RETURNED HIS GREETING WITH DOWNCAST EYES AND BOWED AND BLUSHING FACE THE PRINCE FELT AS IF HIS HEART WERE IN HIS MOUTH THE LOVELY EYES LOOKED UP ONCE MORE AS HE GALLOPED OFF
3557-159359-0034 AND THEY FOLLOWED HIM TILL HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT AND NOT ONLY DID THEY FOLLOW HIM THUS FAR BUT LONG AFTER HE HAD LEFT BOTH HOUSE AND WOOD FAR BEHIND THOSE BEAUTIFUL EYES STILL HAUNTED HIM
3557-159359-0035 AND AS HE RODE ALONG HE SAID TO HIMSELF YES SHE IS BEAUTIFUL AND MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL ENOUGH FOR ME BUT I ALSO VOWED THAT SHE WHOM I MARRY MUST BE AS CLEVER OR NEARLY AS CLEVER
3557-159359-0036 AS I AM AND THAT OF COURSE SHE CANNOT BE HE MARKED WELL WHERE THE LITTLE COTTAGE STOOD AND SOON HE REACHED A ROAD HE KNEW WELL FOR THE WILD WOOD LAY ON THE VERY BORDER OF HIS OWN LAND
3557-159359-0037 HE RODE STRAIGHT HOME TO HIS FATHER'S CASTLE
3557-159359-0038 THE OLD KING WAS MUCH VEXED ON HEARING THIS BUT HE WAS SO CERTAIN OF HIS SON'S EXCEEDING CLEVERNESS THAT HE HAD NO DOUBT MATTERS WERE EXACTLY AS THE PRINCE REPRESENTED HE HAD BUT ONE WISH
3557-159359-0039 TO SEE HIS SON MARRIED BEFORE CLOSING HIS EYES FOREVER AND HE HAD SUCH FAITH IN HIS SON
3557-159359-0040 SO NOW THE PRINCE WAS AT HOME ONCE MORE SURROUNDED BY ALL THE GOOD THINGS IMAGINABLE AND YET HE KNEW NOT ONE MOMENT'S CONTENT
3557-159359-0041 DAINTY FOOD FAILED TO TEMPT HIS APPETITE
3557-159359-0042 AND WHETHER HE WOULD OR NOT AT LAST HE SAID TO HIMSELF THERE MUST BE AN END OF THIS
3557-159359-0043 HE DETERMINED TO CONVINCE HIMSELF
3557-159359-0044 SO HE WROTE A LETTER TO HER
3557-159359-0045 HE SENT OFF A ROYAL COURIER AT ONCE BIDDING HIM BRING BACK AN IMMEDIATE ANSWER
3557-159359-0046 AND NOW HE FELT BOUND TO PERFORM THE VOW THAT HE HAD MADE WHICH WAS JUST WHAT HE MOST WISHED TO DO SO HE RODE FORTH WITH ALL HIS ROYAL TRAIN
