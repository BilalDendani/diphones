2473-157861-0000 PHILIP ROMILLY ON THE LAST DAY OF THE VOYAGE EXPERIENCED TO THE FULL THAT PECULIAR SENSATION OF UNREST WHICH SEEMS INEVITABLY TO PREVAIL WHEN AN OCEANGOING STEAMER IS BEING SLOWLY TOWED INTO PORT THE WINDS OF THE OCEAN HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND
2473-157861-0001 THERE WAS A NEW BUT PLEASANT CHILL IN THE FROSTY SUNLIT AIR THE GREAT BUILDINGS OF NEW YORK AT WHICH HE HAD BEEN GAZING FOR HOURS WERE STANDING HETEROGENEOUS BUT MAGNIFICENT CLEAR CUT AGAINST AN AZURE SKY THE FERRY BOATS

2473-157861-0027 ALTHOUGH IT WAS PRACTICALLY HIS FIRST GLIMPSE OF NEW YORK THE WONDERS OF THE PANORAMA OVER WHICH HE LOOKED FAILED EVEN TO EXCITE HIS CURIOSITY THE CLANGING OF THE SURFACE CARS THE ROAR AND CLATTER OF THE OVERHEAD RAILWAY THE HOOTING OF STREAMS OF AUTOMOBILES
2473-157861-0028 EVERYTHING DEPENDED UPON THEIR BEING CARRIED OUT NOW WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST HITCH HE WALKED A DOZEN TIMES TO THE DOOR WAITING FOR HIS LUGGAGE AND WHEN AT LAST IT ARRIVED HE WAS ON THE POINT OF USING THE TELEPHONE HE FEED THE LINEN COATED PORTERS
2473-157861-0029 AND DISMISSED THEM AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE THEN HE RANSACKED THE TRUNKS UNTIL HE FOUND AMIDST A PILE OF FASHIONABLE CLOTHING A QUIET AND INCONSPICUOUS SUIT OF DARK GREY IN THE BATHROOM HE HASTILY CHANGED HIS CLOTHES
2473-157861-0030 SELECTED AN ORDINARY HOMBURG HAT AND FILLED A SMALL LEATHER CASE WITH VARIOUS PAPERS HE WAS ON THE POINT OF LEAVING THE ROOM WHEN HIS EYES FELL UPON THE CABLE HE HESITATED FOR A MOMENT GAZED AT THE SUPERSCRIPTION

2473-157861-0039 HE WALKED TO THE CORNER OF THE STREET AND DREW A LITTLE BREATH
2473-157861-0040 HIS SPIRITS RISING AT EVERY STEP HE WAS FREE FOR EVER FROM THAT OTHER HATEFUL PERSONALITY
