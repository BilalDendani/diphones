1868-2318-0000 JAMES CUSHAT PRINKLY WAS A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD ALWAYS HAD A SETTLED CONVICTION THAT ONE OF THESE DAYS HE WOULD MARRY UP TO THE AGE OF THIRTY FOUR HE HAD DONE NOTHING TO JUSTIFY THAT CONVICTION
1868-2318-0001 HE LIKED AND ADMIRED A GREAT MANY WOMEN COLLECTIVELY AND DISPASSIONATELY WITHOUT SINGLING OUT ONE FOR ESPECIAL MATRIMONIAL CONSIDERATION
1868-2318-0002 JUST AS ONE MIGHT ADMIRE THE ALPS WITHOUT FEELING THAT ONE WANTED ANY PARTICULAR PEAK AS ONE'S OWN PRIVATE PROPERTY HIS LACK OF INITIATIVE IN THIS MATTER
1868-2318-0003 AROUSED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF IMPATIENCE AMONG THE SENTIMENTALLY MINDED WOMEN FOLK OF HIS HOME CIRCLE HIS MOTHER HIS SISTERS AN AUNT IN RESIDENCE AND TWO OR THREE INTIMATE MATRONLY FRIENDS
1868-2318-0004 REGARDED HIS DILATORY APPROACH TO THE MARRIED STATE WITH A DISAPPROVAL THAT WAS FAR FROM BEING INARTICULATE HIS MOST INNOCENT FLIRTATIONS WERE WATCHED WITH THE STRAINING EAGERNESS WHICH A GROUP OF UNEXERCISED TERRIERS
1868-2318-0005 CONCENTRATES ON THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENTS OF A HUMAN BEING WHO MAY BE REASONABLY CONSIDERED LIKELY TO TAKE THEM FOR A WALK NO DECENT SOULED MORTAL CAN LONG RESIST THE PLEADING OF SEVERAL PAIRS OF WALK BESEECHING DOG EYES
1868-2318-0006 JAMES CUSHAT PRINKLY WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY OBSTINATE OR INDIFFERENT TO HOME INFLUENCES TO DISREGARD THE OBVIOUSLY EXPRESSED WISH OF HIS FAMILY THAT HE SHOULD BECOME ENAMOURED OF SOME NICE MARRIAGEABLE GIRL
1868-2318-0007 AND WHEN HIS UNCLE JULES DEPARTED THIS LIFE AND BEQUEATHED HIM A COMFORTABLE LITTLE LEGACY IT REALLY SEEMED THE CORRECT THING TO DO TO SET ABOUT DISCOVERING SOME ONE TO SHARE IT WITH HIM
1868-2318-0008 THE PROCESS OF DISCOVERY WAS CARRIED ON MORE BY THE FORCE OF SUGGESTION AND THE WEIGHT OF PUBLIC OPINION THAN BY ANY INITIATIVE OF HIS OWN
1868-2318-0009 A CLEAR WORKING MAJORITY OF HIS FEMALE RELATIVES AND THE AFORESAID MATRONLY FRIENDS HAD PITCHED ON JOAN SEBASTABLE AS THE MOST SUITABLE YOUNG WOMAN IN HIS RANGE OF ACQUAINTANCE TO WHOM HE MIGHT PROPOSE MARRIAGE
1868-2318-0010 AND JAMES BECAME GRADUALLY ACCUSTOMED TO THE IDEA THAT HE AND JOAN WOULD GO TOGETHER THROUGH THE PRESCRIBED STAGES OF CONGRATULATIONS PRESENT RECEIVING NORWEGIAN OR MEDITERRANEAN HOTELS
1868-2318-0011 AND EVENTUAL DOMESTICITY IT WAS NECESSARY HOWEVER TO ASK THE LADY WHAT SHE THOUGHT ABOUT THE MATTER THE FAMILY HAD SO FAR CONDUCTED AND DIRECTED THE FLIRTATION WITH ABILITY AND DISCRETION
1868-2318-0012 AS THE THING WAS GOING TO BE DONE HE WAS GLAD TO FEEL THAT HE WAS GOING TO GET IT SETTLED AND OFF HIS MIND THAT AFTERNOON PROPOSING MARRIAGE EVEN TO A NICE GIRL LIKE JOAN WAS A RATHER IRKSOME BUSINESS
1868-2318-0013 BUT ONE COULD NOT HAVE A HONEYMOON IN MINORCA AND A SUBSEQUENT LIFE OF MARRIED HAPPINESS WITHOUT SUCH PRELIMINARY HE WONDERED WHAT MINORCA WAS REALLY LIKE AS A PLACE TO STOP IN
1868-2318-0014 IN HIS MIND'S EYE IT WAS AN ISLAND IN PERPETUAL HALF MOURNING WITH BLACK OR WHITE MINORCA HENS RUNNING ALL OVER IT PROBABLY IT WOULD NOT BE A BIT LIKE THAT WHEN ONE CAME TO EXAMINE IT
1868-2318-0015 PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN IN RUSSIA HAD TOLD HIM THAT THEY DID NOT REMEMBER HAVING SEEN ANY MUSCOVY DUCKS THERE SO IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MINORCA FOWLS ON THE ISLAND
1868-2318-0016 HIS MEDITERRANEAN MUSINGS WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE SOUND OF A CLOCK STRIKING THE HALF HOUR HALF PAST FOUR A FROWN OF DISSATISFACTION SETTLED ON HIS FACE
1868-2318-0017 HE WOULD ARRIVE AT THE SEBASTABLE MANSION JUST AT THE HOUR OF AFTERNOON TEA JOAN WOULD BE SEATED AT A LOW TABLE SPREAD WITH AN ARRAY OF SILVER KETTLES AND CREAM JUGS AND DELICATE PORCELAIN TEA CUPS
1868-2318-0018 BEHIND WHICH HER VOICE WOULD TINKLE PLEASANTLY IN A SERIES OF LITTLE FRIENDLY QUESTIONS ABOUT WEAK OR STRONG TEA HOW MUCH IF ANY SUGAR MILK CREAM AND SO FORTH IS IT ONE LUMP
1868-2318-0019 I FORGOT YOU DO TAKE MILK DON'T YOU WOULD YOU LIKE SOME MORE HOT WATER IF IT'S TOO STRONG CUSHAT PRINKLY HAD READ OF SUCH THINGS IN SCORES OF NOVELS
1868-2318-0020 AND HUNDREDS OF ACTUAL EXPERIENCES HAD TOLD HIM THAT THEY WERE TRUE TO LIFE THOUSANDS OF WOMEN AT THIS SOLEMN AFTERNOON HOUR WERE SITTING BEHIND DAINTY PORCELAIN AND SILVER FITTINGS
1868-2318-0021 WITH THEIR VOICES TINKLING PLEASANTLY IN A CASCADE OF SOLICITOUS LITTLE QUESTIONS CUSHAT PRINKLY DETESTED THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF AFTERNOON TEA ACCORDING TO HIS THEORY OF LIFE
1868-2318-0022 A WOMAN SHOULD LIE ON A DIVAN OR COUCH TALKING WITH INCOMPARABLE CHARM
1868-2318-0023 OR MERELY SILENT AS A THING TO BE LOOKED ON AND FROM BEHIND A SILKEN CURTAIN A SMALL NUBIAN PAGE SHOULD SILENTLY BRING IN A TRAY WITH CUPS AND DAINTIES TO BE ACCEPTED SILENTLY AS A MATTER OF COURSE
1868-2318-0024 WITHOUT DRAWN OUT CHATTER ABOUT CREAM AND SUGAR AND HOT WATER IF ONE'S SOUL WAS REALLY ENSLAVED AT ONE'S MISTRESS'S FEET HOW COULD ONE TALK COHERENTLY ABOUT WEAKENED TEA
1868-2318-0025 CUSHAT PRINKLY HAD NEVER EXPOUNDED HIS VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT TO HIS MOTHER ALL HER LIFE SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO TINKLE PLEASANTLY AT TEA TIME BEHIND DAINTY PORCELAIN AND SILVER
1868-2318-0026 AND IF HE HAD SPOKEN TO HER ABOUT DIVANS AND NUBIAN PAGES SHE WOULD HAVE URGED HIM TO TAKE A WEEK'S HOLIDAY AT THE SEASIDE
1868-2318-0027 NOW AS HE PASSED THROUGH A TANGLE OF SMALL STREETS THAT LED INDIRECTLY TO THE ELEGANT MAYFAIR TERRACE FOR WHICH HE WAS BOUND A HORROR AT THE IDEA OF CONFRONTING JOAN SEBASTABLE AT HER TEA TABLE SEIZED ON HIM
1868-2318-0028 A MOMENTARY DELIVERANCE PRESENTED ITSELF ON ONE FLOOR OF A NARROW LITTLE HOUSE AT THE NOISIER END OF ESQUIMAULT STREET LIVED RHODA ELLAM A SORT OF REMOTE COUSIN
1868-2318-0029 WHO MADE A LIVING BY CREATING HATS OUT OF COSTLY MATERIALS THE HATS REALLY LOOKED AS IF THEY HAD COME FROM PARIS THE CHEQUES SHE GOT FOR THEM UNFORTUNATELY NEVER LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO PARIS
1868-2318-0030 THE IMPORTANT BUSINESS WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM BY SPINNING OUT HIS VISIT HE COULD CONTRIVE TO REACH THE SEBASTABLE MANSION AFTER THE LAST VESTIGES OF DAINTY PORCELAIN HAD BEEN CLEARED AWAY
1868-2318-0031 RHODA WELCOMED HIM INTO A ROOM THAT SEEMED TO DO DUTY AS WORKSHOP SITTING ROOM AND KITCHEN COMBINED AND TO BE WONDERFULLY CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE AT THE SAME TIME I'M HAVING A PICNIC MEAL
1868-2318-0032 SHE ANNOUNCED THERE'S CAVIARE IN THAT JAR AT YOUR ELBOW BEGIN ON THAT BROWN BREAD AND BUTTER WHILE I CUT SOME MORE FIND YOURSELF A CUP THE TEAPOT IS BEHIND YOU NOW TELL ME ABOUT HUNDREDS OF THINGS
1868-2318-0033 SHE MADE NO OTHER ALLUSION TO FOOD BUT TALKED AMUSINGLY AND MADE HER VISITOR TALK AMUSINGLY TOO AT THE SAME TIME SHE CUT THE BREAD AND BUTTER WITH A MASTERLY SKILL
1868-2318-0034 AND PRODUCED RED PEPPER AND SLICED LEMON WHERE SO MANY WOMEN WOULD MERELY HAVE PRODUCED REASONS AND REGRETS FOR NOT HAVING ANY CUSHAT PRINKLY FOUND THAT HE WAS ENJOYING AN EXCELLENT TEA
1868-2318-0035 WITHOUT HAVING TO ANSWER AS MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT IT AS A MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE MIGHT BE CALLED ON TO REPLY TO DURING AN OUTBREAK OF CATTLE PLAGUE AND NOW TELL ME WHY YOU HAVE COME TO SEE ME SAID RHODA SUDDENLY
1868-2318-0036 YOU AROUSE NOT MERELY MY CURIOSITY BUT MY BUSINESS INSTINCTS I HOPE YOU'VE COME ABOUT HATS I HEARD THAT YOU HAD COME INTO A LEGACY THE OTHER DAY
1868-2318-0037 AND OF COURSE IT STRUCK ME THAT IT WOULD BE A BEAUTIFUL AND DESIRABLE THING FOR YOU TO CELEBRATE THE EVENT BY BUYING BRILLIANTLY EXPENSIVE HATS FOR ALL YOUR SISTERS THEY MAY NOT HAVE SAID ANYTHING ABOUT IT
1868-2318-0038 BUT I FEEL SURE THE SAME IDEA HAS OCCURRED TO THEM OF COURSE WITH GOODWOOD ON US I AM RATHER RUSHED JUST NOW BUT IN MY BUSINESS WE'RE ACCUSTOMED TO THAT WE LIVE IN A SERIES OF RUSHES LIKE THE INFANT MOSES
1868-2318-0039 I DIDN'T COME ABOUT HATS SAID HER VISITOR IN FACT I DON'T THINK I REALLY CAME ABOUT ANYTHING I WAS PASSING AND I JUST THOUGHT I'D LOOK IN AND SEE YOU SINCE I'VE BEEN SITTING TALKING TO YOU HOWEVER
1868-2318-0040 IF YOU'LL FORGET GOODWOOD FOR A MOMENT AND LISTEN TO ME I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS SOME FORTY MINUTES LATER JAMES CUSHAT PRINKLY RETURNED TO THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY BEARING AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF NEWS
1868-2318-0041 I'M ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED HE ANNOUNCED A RAPTUROUS OUTBREAK OF CONGRATULATION AND SELF APPLAUSE BROKE OUT AH WE KNEW
1868-2318-0042 I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T SAID CUSHAT PRINKLY IF ANY ONE HAD TOLD ME AT LUNCH TIME TO DAY THAT I WAS GOING TO ASK RHODA ELLAM TO MARRY ME AND THAT SHE WAS GOING TO ACCEPT ME I WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT THE IDEA
1868-2318-0043 THE ROMANTIC SUDDENNESS OF THE AFFAIR IN SOME MEASURE COMPENSATED JAMES'S WOMEN FOLK FOR THE RUTHLESS NEGATION OF ALL THEIR PATIENT EFFORT AND SKILLED DIPLOMACY
1868-2318-0044 IT WAS RATHER TRYING TO HAVE TO DEFLECT THEIR ENTHUSIASM AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE FROM JOAN SEBASTABLE TO RHODA ELLAM BUT AFTER ALL IT WAS JAMES'S WIFE WHO WAS IN QUESTION
1868-2318-0045 AND HIS TASTES HAD SOME CLAIM TO BE CONSIDERED ON A SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON OF THE SAME YEAR AFTER THE HONEYMOON IN MINORCA HAD ENDED
1868-2318-0046 THERE WAS A PLEASANT TINKLING NOTE IN HER VOICE AS SHE HANDED HIM A CUP YOU LIKE IT WEAKER THAN THAT DON'T YOU SHALL I PUT SOME MORE HOT WATER TO IT
