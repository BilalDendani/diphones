5656-44576-0000 MOTTE OUR ENGLISH HAS CHANGED WITH THE YEARS SO THAT MANY WORDS NOW CONNOTE MORE THAN THEY DID ORIGINALLY THIS IS TRUE OF THE WORD MONOTONOUS FROM HAVING BUT ONE TONE IT HAS COME TO MEAN MORE BROADLY
5656-44576-0001 LACK OF VARIATION THE MONOTONOUS SPEAKER NOT ONLY DRONES ALONG IN THE SAME VOLUME AND PITCH OF TONE BUT USES ALWAYS THE SAME EMPHASIS THE SAME SPEED THE SAME THOUGHTS OR DISPENSES WITH THOUGHT ALTOGETHER
5656-44576-0002 MONOTONY THE CARDINAL AND MOST COMMON SIN OF THE PUBLIC SPEAKER IS NOT A TRANSGRESSION IT IS RATHER A SIN OF OMISSION FOR IT CONSISTS IN LIVING UP TO THE CONFESSION OF THE PRAYER BOOK
5656-44576-0003 WE HAVE LEFT UNDONE THOSE THINGS WE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
5656-44576-0004 SO LET US LOOK AT THE NATURE AND THE CURSE OF MONOTONY IN OTHER SPHERES OF LIFE THEN WE SHALL APPRECIATE MORE FULLY HOW IT WILL BLIGHT AN OTHERWISE GOOD SPEECH
5656-44576-0005 IF THE VICTROLA IN THE ADJOINING APARTMENT GRINDS OUT JUST THREE SELECTIONS OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT IS PRETTY SAFE TO ASSUME THAT YOUR NEIGHBOR HAS NO OTHER RECORDS IF A SPEAKER USES ONLY A FEW OF HIS POWERS
5656-44576-0006 IT POINTS VERY PLAINLY TO THE FACT THAT THE REST OF HIS POWERS ARE NOT DEVELOPED MONOTONY REVEALS OUR LIMITATIONS IN ITS EFFECT ON ITS VICTIM MONOTONY IS ACTUALLY DEADLY
5656-44576-0007 IT WILL DRIVE THE BLOOM FROM THE CHEEK AND THE LUSTRE FROM THE EYE AS QUICKLY AS SIN AND OFTEN LEADS TO VICIOUSNESS THE WORST PUNISHMENT THAT HUMAN INGENUITY HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO INVENT IS EXTREME MONOTONY
5656-44576-0008 SOLITARY CONFINEMENT LAY A MARBLE ON THE TABLE AND DO NOTHING EIGHTEEN HOURS OF THE DAY BUT CHANGE THAT MARBLE FROM ONE POINT TO ANOTHER AND BACK AGAIN AND YOU WILL GO INSANE IF YOU CONTINUE LONG ENOUGH SO THIS THING THAT SHORTENS LIFE
5656-44576-0009 AND IS USED AS THE MOST CRUEL OF PUNISHMENTS IN OUR PRISONS IS THE THING THAT WILL DESTROY ALL THE LIFE AND FORCE OF A SPEECH AVOID IT AS YOU WOULD SHUN A DEADLY DULL BORE THE IDLE RICH CAN HAVE HALF A DOZEN HOMES
5656-44576-0010 COMMAND ALL THE VARIETIES OF FOODS GATHERED FROM THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH AND SAIL FOR AFRICA OR ALASKA AT THEIR PLEASURE BUT THE POVERTY STRICKEN MAN MUST WALK OR TAKE A STREET CAR HE DOES NOT HAVE THE CHOICE OF YACHT AUTO OR SPECIAL TRAIN
5656-44576-0011 HE MUST SPEND THE MOST OF HIS LIFE IN LABOR AND BE CONTENT WITH THE STAPLES OF THE FOOD MARKET MONOTONY IS POVERTY WHETHER IN SPEECH OR IN LIFE STRIVE TO INCREASE THE VARIETY OF YOUR SPEECH AS THE BUSINESS MAN
5656-44576-0012 LABORS TO AUGMENT HIS WEALTH BIRD SONGS FOREST GLENS AND MOUNTAINS ARE NOT MONOTONOUS IT IS THE LONG ROWS OF BROWN STONE FRONTS AND THE MILES OF PAVED STREETS THAT ARE SO TERRIBLY SAME
5656-44576-0013 NATURE IN HER WEALTH GIVES US ENDLESS VARIETY MAN WITH HIS LIMITATIONS IS OFTEN MONOTONOUS GET BACK TO NATURE IN YOUR METHODS OF SPEECH MAKING THE POWER OF VARIETY LIES IN ITS PLEASURE GIVING QUALITY
5656-44576-0014 THE GREAT TRUTHS OF THE WORLD HAVE OFTEN BEEN COUCHED IN FASCINATING STORIES LES MISERABLES FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WISH TO TEACH OR INFLUENCE MEN YOU MUST PLEASE THEM FIRST OR LAST
5656-44576-0015 STRIKE THE SAME NOTE ON THE PIANO OVER AND OVER AGAIN THIS WILL GIVE YOU SOME IDEA OF THE DISPLEASING JARRING EFFECT MONOTONY HAS ON THE EAR THE DICTIONARY DEFINES MONOTONOUS AS BEING SYNONYMOUS WITH WEARISOME
5656-44576-0016 THAT IS PUTTING IT MILDLY IT IS MADDENING
5656-44576-0017 AND THE PLEASED PEOPLE NATURALLY SLIP INTO A BUYING MOOD HOW TO CONQUER MONOTONY WE OBVIATE MONOTONY IN DRESS BY REPLENISHING OUR WARDROBES WE AVOID MONOTONY IN SPEECH BY MULTIPLYING OUR POWERS OF SPEECH
5656-44576-0018 WE MULTIPLY OUR POWERS OF SPEECH BY INCREASING OUR TOOLS THE CARPENTER HAS SPECIAL IMPLEMENTS WITH WHICH TO CONSTRUCT THE SEVERAL PARTS OF A BUILDING THE ORGANIST HAS CERTAIN KEYS AND STOPS
5656-44576-0019 WHICH HE MANIPULATES TO PRODUCE HIS HARMONIES AND EFFECTS IN LIKE MANNER THE SPEAKER HAS CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS AND TOOLS AT HIS COMMAND BY WHICH HE BUILDS HIS ARGUMENT PLAYS ON THE FEELINGS AND GUIDES THE BELIEFS OF HIS AUDIENCE
5656-44576-0020 AND WHY DID NOT NOAH HAVE MOVING PICTURE ENTERTAINMENTS AND TALKING MACHINES ON THE ARK THE LAWS THAT ENABLE US TO OPERATE AN AUTOMOBILE PRODUCE MOVING PICTURES OR MUSIC ON THE VICTROLA WOULD HAVE WORKED JUST AS WELL THEN AS THEY DO TODAY
5656-44576-0021 IT WAS IGNORANCE OF LAW THAT FOR AGES DEPRIVED HUMANITY OF OUR MODERN CONVENIENCES MANY SPEAKERS STILL USE OX CART METHODS IN THEIR SPEECH INSTEAD OF EMPLOYING AUTOMOBILE OR OVERLAND EXPRESS METHODS
5656-44576-0022 THEY ARE IGNORANT OF LAWS THAT MAKE FOR EFFICIENCY IN SPEAKING JUST TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU REGARD AND USE THE LAWS THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO EXAMINE AND LEARN HOW TO USE WILL YOU HAVE EFFICIENCY AND FORCE IN YOUR SPEAKING
5656-44576-0023 AND JUST TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU DISREGARD THEM WILL YOUR SPEAKING BE FEEBLE AND INEFFECTIVE WE CANNOT IMPRESS TOO THOROUGHLY UPON YOU THE NECESSITY FOR A REAL WORKING MASTERY OF THESE PRINCIPLES
5656-44576-0024 THEY ARE THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF SUCCESSFUL SPEAKING GET YOUR PRINCIPLES RIGHT SAID NAPOLEON AND THE REST IS A MATTER OF DETAIL IT IS USELESS TO SHOE A DEAD HORSE AND ALL THE SOUND PRINCIPLES IN CHRISTENDOM
5656-44576-0025 WILL NEVER MAKE A LIVE SPEECH OUT OF A DEAD ONE SO LET IT BE UNDERSTOOD THAT PUBLIC SPEAKING IS NOT A MATTER OF MASTERING A FEW DEAD RULES
5656-44576-0026 FORCE FEELING AND LIFE FORGET ALL ELSE BUT NOT THIS WHEN YOU HAVE MASTERED THE MECHANICS OF SPEECH OUTLINED IN THE NEXT FEW CHAPTERS YOU WILL NO LONGER BE TROUBLED WITH MONOTONY
5656-44576-0027 PRACTISE IF NO ONE ELSE WILL LISTEN TO YOU LISTEN TO YOURSELF YOU MUST ALWAYS BE YOUR OWN BEST CRITIC AND THE SEVEREST ONE OF ALL
5656-44576-0028 THE TECHNICAL PRINCIPLES THAT WE LAY DOWN IN THE FOLLOWING CHAPTERS ARE NOT ARBITRARY CREATIONS OF OUR OWN THEY ARE ALL FOUNDED ON THE PRACTICES THAT GOOD SPEAKERS AND ACTORS ADOPT EITHER NATURALLY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY OR UNDER INSTRUCTION
5656-44576-0029 THE LITTLE STRAWBERRY UP IN THE ARCTICS WITH A FEW TINY SEEDS AND AN ACID TANG IS A NATURAL BERRY BUT IT IS NOT TO BE COMPARED WITH THE IMPROVED VARIETY THAT WE ENJOY HERE THE DWARFED OAK ON THE ROCKY HILLSIDE IS NATURAL
5656-44576-0030 BUT A POOR THING COMPARED WITH THE BEAUTIFUL TREE FOUND IN THE RICH MOIST BOTTOM LANDS BE NATURAL BUT IMPROVE YOUR NATURAL GIFTS UNTIL YOU HAVE APPROACHED THE IDEAL FOR WE MUST STRIVE AFTER IDEALIZED NATURE IN FRUIT
5656-44576-0031 TREE AND SPEECH QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES ONE WHAT ARE THE CAUSES OF MONOTONY TWO CITE SOME INSTANCES IN NATURE THREE
5656-44576-0032 CITE INSTANCES IN MAN'S DAILY LIFE FOUR DESCRIBE SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF MONOTONY IN BOTH CASES FIVE READ ALOUD SOME SPEECH WITHOUT PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO ITS MEANING OR FORCE
5656-44576-0033 SIX NOW REPEAT IT AFTER YOU HAVE THOROUGHLY ASSIMILATED ITS MATTER AND SPIRIT WHAT DIFFERENCE DO YOU NOTICE IN ITS RENDITION SEVEN
