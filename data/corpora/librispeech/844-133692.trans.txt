844-133692-0000 SHE WAS SHORT AND SOLID AND HER CLAIM TO FIGURE WAS QUESTIONED BUT SHE WAS CONCEDED PRESENCE THOUGH NOT MAJESTY
844-133692-0001 AND HER SISTER ISABEL'S ORIGINALITY I'VE NEVER KEPT UP WITH ISABEL
844-133692-0002 SHE HAD OFTEN REMARKED IN SPITE OF WHICH HOWEVER SHE HELD HER RATHER WISTFULLY IN SIGHT
844-133692-0003 MIGHT WATCH A FREE GREYHOUND I WANT TO SEE HER SAFELY MARRIED THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SEE SHE FREQUENTLY NOTED TO HER HUSBAND WELL I MUST SAY I SHOULD HAVE NO PARTICULAR DESIRE TO MARRY HER
844-133692-0004 EDMUND LUDLOW WAS ACCUSTOMED TO ANSWER IN AN EXTREMELY AUDIBLE TONE
844-133692-0005 EXCEPT THAT SHE'S SO ORIGINAL WELL I DON'T LIKE ORIGINALS I LIKE TRANSLATIONS MISTER LUDLOW HAD MORE THAN ONCE REPLIED
844-133692-0006 SHE OUGHT TO MARRY AN ARMENIAN OR A PORTUGUESE
844-133692-0007 OF MISSUS TOUCHETT'S APPEARANCE AND IN THE EVENING PREPARED TO COMPLY WITH THEIR AUNT'S COMMANDS OF WHAT ISABEL THEN SAID NO REPORT HAS REMAINED
844-133692-0008 AS THE TWO WERE MAKING READY FOR THEIR VISIT I DO HOPE IMMENSELY SHE'LL DO SOMETHING HANDSOME FOR ISABEL SHE HAS EVIDENTLY TAKEN A GREAT FANCY TO HER WHAT IS IT YOU WISH HER TO DO EDMUND LUDLOW ASKED
844-133692-0009 NO INDEED NOTHING OF THE SORT BUT TAKE AN INTEREST IN HER SYMPATHISE WITH HER SHE'S EVIDENTLY JUST THE SORT OF PERSON TO APPRECIATE HER SHE HAS LIVED SO MUCH IN FOREIGN SOCIETY
844-133692-0010 DON'T YOU THINK SHE GETS ENOUGH AT HOME WELL SHE OUGHT TO GO ABROAD SAID MISSUS LUDLOW SHE'S JUST THE PERSON TO GO ABROAD AND YOU WANT THE OLD LADY TO TAKE HER IS THAT IT SHE HAS OFFERED TO TAKE HER SHE'S DYING TO HAVE ISABEL GO
844-133692-0011 A CHANCE FOR WHAT A CHANCE TO DEVELOP OH MOSES EDMUND LUDLOW EXCLAIMED I HOPE SHE ISN'T GOING TO DEVELOP ANY MORE IF I WERE NOT SURE YOU ONLY SAID THAT FOR ARGUMENT
844-133692-0012 I SHOULD FEEL VERY BADLY HIS WIFE REPLIED BUT YOU KNOW YOU LOVE HER
844-133692-0013 WHILE HE BRUSHED HIS HAT I'M SURE I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT EXCLAIMED THE GIRL
844-133692-0014 BUT ISABEL CHALLENGED THIS ASSERTION WITH A GOOD DEAL OF SERIOUSNESS YOU MUST NOT SAY THAT LILY I DON'T FEEL GRAND AT ALL I'M SURE THERE'S NO HARM SAID THE CONCILIATORY LILY
844-133692-0015 AH BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN MISSUS TOUCHETT'S VISIT TO MAKE ONE FEEL GRAND OH EXCLAIMED LUDLOW SHE'S GRANDER THAN EVER WHENEVER I FEEL GRAND SAID THE GIRL IT WILL BE FOR A BETTER REASON
844-133692-0016 WHETHER SHE FELT GRAND OR NO SHE AT ANY RATE FELT DIFFERENT AS IF SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO HER LEFT TO HERSELF FOR THE EVENING SHE SAT A WHILE UNDER THE LAMP HER HANDS EMPTY HER USUAL AVOCATIONS UNHEEDED
844-133692-0017 THEN SHE ROSE AND MOVED ABOUT THE ROOM AND FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER PREFERRING THE PLACES WHERE THE VAGUE LAMPLIGHT EXPIRED SHE WAS RESTLESS AND EVEN AGITATED AT MOMENTS SHE TREMBLED A
844-133692-0018 THERE HAD REALLY BEEN A CHANGE IN HER LIFE
844-133692-0019 BUT ISABEL WAS IN A SITUATION THAT GAVE A VALUE TO ANY CHANGE SHE HAD A DESIRE TO LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND HER AND AS SHE SAID TO HERSELF TO BEGIN AFRESH THIS DESIRE INDEED WAS NOT A BIRTH OF THE PRESENT OCCASION
844-133692-0020 AND IT HAD LED TO HER BEGINNING AFRESH A GREAT MANY TIMES
844-133692-0021 BUT IT WAS NOT WITH A DESIRE FOR DOZING FORGETFULNESS
844-133692-0022 THE SENSE OF SEEING TOO MANY THINGS AT ONCE HER IMAGINATION WAS BY HABIT RIDICULOUSLY ACTIVE WHEN THE DOOR WAS NOT OPEN IT JUMPED OUT OF THE WINDOW SHE WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED INDEED TO KEEP IT BEHIND BOLTS
844-133692-0023 AND AT IMPORTANT MOMENTS WHEN SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN THANKFUL TO MAKE USE OF HER JUDGEMENT ALONE SHE PAID THE PENALTY OF HAVING GIVEN UNDUE ENCOURAGEMENT
844-133692-0024 OF THE THINGS SHE WAS LEAVING BEHIND HER THE YEARS AND HOURS OF HER LIFE CAME BACK TO HER AND FOR A LONG TIME IN A STILLNESS BROKEN ONLY BY THE TICKING OF THE BIG BRONZE CLOCK SHE PASSED THEM IN REVIEW
844-133692-0025 IT HAD BEEN A VERY HAPPY LIFE AND SHE HAD BEEN A VERY FORTUNATE PERSON
844-133692-0026 SHE HAD HAD THE BEST OF EVERYTHING AND IN A WORLD IN WHICH THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SO MANY PEOPLE MADE THEM UNENVIABLE IT WAS AN ADVANTAGE NEVER TO HAVE KNOWN ANYTHING PARTICULARLY UNPLEASANT
844-133692-0027 IT APPEARED TO ISABEL THAT THE UNPLEASANT HAD BEEN EVEN TOO ABSENT FROM HER KNOWLEDGE FOR SHE HAD GATHERED FROM HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH LITERATURE THAT IT WAS OFTEN A SOURCE OF INTEREST AND EVEN OF INSTRUCTION
844-133692-0028 HER FATHER HAD KEPT IT AWAY FROM HER HER HANDSOME MUCH LOVED FATHER WHO ALWAYS HAD SUCH AN AVERSION TO IT IT WAS A GREAT FELICITY TO HAVE BEEN HIS DAUGHTER ISABEL ROSE EVEN TO PRIDE IN HER PARENTAGE
844-133692-0029 SINCE HIS DEATH SHE HAD SEEMED TO SEE HIM AS TURNING HIS BRAVER SIDE TO HIS CHILDREN AND AS NOT HAVING MANAGED TO IGNORE THE UGLY QUITE SO MUCH IN PRACTICE AS IN ASPIRATION BUT THIS ONLY MADE HER TENDERNESS FOR HIM GREATER
844-133692-0030 TOO INDIFFERENT TO SORDID CONSIDERATIONS
844-133692-0031 ESPECIALLY THE LARGE NUMBER OF THOSE
844-133692-0032 OF THEIR OPINIONS ISABEL WAS NEVER VERY DEFINITELY INFORMED
844-133692-0033 A REMARKABLY HANDSOME HEAD AND A VERY TAKING MANNER INDEED AS ONE OF THEM HAD SAID HE WAS ALWAYS TAKING SOMETHING THEY HAD DECLARED THAT HE WAS MAKING A VERY POOR USE OF HIS LIFE HE HAD SQUANDERED A SUBSTANTIAL FORTUNE
844-133692-0034 HE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE GAMBLED FREELY A FEW VERY HARSH CRITICS WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN BROUGHT UP HIS DAUGHTERS THEY HAD HAD NO REGULAR EDUCATION AND NO PERMANENT HOME THEY HAD BEEN AT ONCE SPOILED AND NEGLECTED
844-133692-0035 THEY HAD LIVED WITH NURSEMAIDS AND GOVERNESSES USUALLY VERY BAD ONES OR HAD BEEN SENT TO SUPERFICIAL SCHOOLS KEPT BY THE FRENCH FROM WHICH AT THE END OF A MONTH THEY HAD BEEN REMOVED IN TEARS THIS VIEW OF THE MATTER WOULD HAVE EXCITED
844-133692-0036 WHO HAD ELOPED WITH A RUSSIAN NOBLEMAN STAYING AT THE SAME HOTEL EVEN IN THIS IRREGULAR SITUATION AN INCIDENT OF THE GIRL'S ELEVENTH YEAR
844-133692-0037 HER FATHER HAD A LARGE WAY OF LOOKING AT LIFE OF WHICH HIS RESTLESSNESS AND EVEN HIS OCCASIONAL INCOHERENCY OF CONDUCT HAD BEEN ONLY A PROOF
844-133692-0038 TO SEE AS MUCH OF THE WORLD AS POSSIBLE AND IT WAS FOR THIS PURPOSE THAT BEFORE ISABEL WAS FOURTEEN HE HAD TRANSPORTED THEM THREE TIMES ACROSS THE ATLANTIC GIVING THEM ON EACH OCCASION HOWEVER BUT A FEW MONTHS VIEW OF THE SUBJECT PROPOSED
844-133692-0039 SHE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN A PARTISAN OF HER FATHER FOR SHE WAS THE MEMBER OF HIS TRIO WHO MOST MADE UP TO HIM FOR THE DISAGREEABLES HE DIDN'T MENTION IN HIS LAST DAYS HIS GENERAL WILLINGNESS TO TAKE LEAVE OF A WORLD
844-133692-0040 IN WHICH THE DIFFICULTY OF DOING AS ONE LIKED APPEARED TO INCREASE AS ONE GREW OLDER HAD BEEN SENSIBLY MODIFIED BY THE PAIN OF SEPARATION FROM HIS CLEVER HIS SUPERIOR HIS REMARKABLE GIRL LATER WHEN THE JOURNEYS TO EUROPE CEASED
844-133692-0041 AND IF HE HAD BEEN TROUBLED ABOUT MONEY MATTERS NOTHING EVER DISTURBED THEIR IRREFLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MANY POSSESSIONS
844-133692-0042 OF THE CHOREOGRAPHIC CIRCLE HER SISTER
844-133692-0043 SO VERY MUCH MORE FETCHING
844-133692-0044 ABOVE ALL WITH RIGHTNESS OF EFFECT NINETEEN PERSONS OUT OF TWENTY INCLUDING THE YOUNGER SISTER HERSELF
844-133692-0045 HAD THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THINKING ALL THE OTHERS AESTHETIC VULGARIANS
844-133692-0046 BUT THE DEPTHS OF THIS YOUNG LADY'S NATURE WERE A VERY OUT OF THE WAY PLACE BETWEEN WHICH AND THE SURFACE COMMUNICATION WAS INTERRUPTED BY A DOZEN CAPRICIOUS FORCES
844-133692-0047 THEY HAD A BELIEF THAT SOME SPECIAL PREPARATION WAS REQUIRED FOR TALKING WITH HER HER REPUTATION OF READING A GREAT DEAL HUNG ABOUT HER LIKE THE CLOUDY ENVELOPE OF A GODDESS IN AN EPIC IT WAS SUPPOSED TO ENGENDER DIFFICULT QUESTIONS
844-133692-0048 AND TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION AT A LOW TEMPERATURE THE POOR GIRL LIKED TO BE THOUGHT CLEVER BUT SHE HATED TO BE THOUGHT BOOKISH
844-133692-0049 SHE HAD A GREAT DESIRE FOR KNOWLEDGE BUT SHE REALLY PREFERRED ALMOST ANY SOURCE OF INFORMATION TO THE PRINTED PAGE
844-133692-0050 ABOUT LIFE AND WAS CONSTANTLY STARING AND WONDERING SHE CARRIED WITHIN HERSELF A GREAT FUND OF LIFE AND HER DEEPEST ENJOYMENT WAS TO FEEL THE CONTINUITY
844-133692-0051 AND THE AGITATIONS OF THE WORLD FOR THIS REASON SHE WAS FOND OF SEEING GREAT CROWDS AND LARGE STRETCHES OF COUNTRY OF READING ABOUT REVOLUTIONS AND WARS OF LOOKING AT HISTORICAL PICTURES A CLASS OF EFFORTS
844-133692-0052 AS TO WHICH SHE HAD OFTEN COMMITTED THE CONSCIOUS SOLECISM OF FORGIVING THEM MUCH BAD PAINTING FOR THE SAKE OF THE SUBJECT WHILE THE CIVIL WAR WENT ON SHE WAS STILL A VERY YOUNG GIRL BUT SHE PASSED MONTHS OF THIS LONG PERIOD IN A STATE OF
844-133692-0053 ALMOST PASSIONATE EXCITEMENT IN WHICH SHE FELT HERSELF AT TIMES TO HER EXTREME CONFUSION
844-133692-0054 FOR THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHOSE HEARTS AS THEY APPROACHED HER BEAT ONLY JUST FAST ENOUGH TO REMIND THEM THEY HAD HEADS AS WELL HAD KEPT HER UNACQUAINTED WITH THE SUPREME DISCIPLINES OF HER SEX AND AGE
844-133692-0055 KINDNESS ADMIRATION BONBONS BOUQUETS
844-133692-0056 SHE LIVED IN ABUNDANT OPPORTUNITY FOR DANCING PLENTY OF NEW DRESSES THE LONDON SPECTATOR THE LATEST PUBLICATIONS THE MUSIC OF GOUNOD THE POETRY OF BROWNING THE PROSE OF GEORGE ELIOT THESE THINGS NOW AS MEMORY PLAYED OVER THEM
844-133692-0057 THE RESULT WAS KALEIDOSCOPIC
844-133692-0058 THE NAME OF THE GENTLEMAN WAS CASPAR GOODWOOD
844-133692-0059 THINKING HER THE MOST BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN OF HER TIME HAD PRONOUNCED THE TIME ACCORDING TO THE RULE I HAVE HINTED AT A FOOLISH PERIOD OF HISTORY
844-133692-0060 SHE HAD THOUGHT IT VERY POSSIBLE HE WOULD COME IN
844-133692-0061 WAS INDEED QUITE A SPLENDID YOUNG MAN HE INSPIRED HER WITH A SENTIMENT OF HIGH OF RARE RESPECT SHE HAD NEVER FELT EQUALLY MOVED TO IT BY ANY OTHER PERSON HE WAS SUPPOSED BY THE WORLD IN GENERAL TO WISH TO MARRY HER
844-133692-0062 BUT THIS OF COURSE WAS BETWEEN THEMSELVES
844-133692-0063 EXPRESSLY TO SEE HER HAVING LEARNED IN THE FORMER CITY WHERE HE WAS SPENDING A FEW DAYS AND WHERE HE HAD HOPED TO FIND HER THAT SHE WAS STILL AT THE STATE CAPITAL
844-133692-0064 ISABEL DELAYED FOR SOME MINUTES TO GO TO HIM SHE MOVED ABOUT THE ROOM WITH A NEW SENSE OF COMPLICATIONS BUT AT LAST SHE PRESENTED HERSELF AND FOUND HIM STANDING NEAR THE LAMP HE WAS TALL STRONG AND SOMEWHAT STIFF
844-133692-0065 HE WAS ALSO LEAN AND BROWN HE WAS NOT ROMANTICALLY HE WAS MUCH RATHER OBSCURELY HANDSOME BUT HIS PHYSIOGNOMY HAD AN AIR
844-133692-0066 OF REQUESTING YOUR ATTENTION WHICH IT REWARDED ACCORDING TO THE CHARM YOU FOUND IN BLUE EYES OF REMARKABLE FIXEDNESS THE EYES OF A COMPLEXION OTHER THAN HIS OWN AND A JAW OF THE SOMEWHAT ANGULAR MOULD WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BESPEAK RESOLUTION
844-133692-0067 ISABEL SAID TO HERSELF THAT IT BESPOKE RESOLUTION TO NIGHT IN SPITE OF WHICH IN HALF AN HOUR CASPAR GOODWOOD WHO HAD ARRIVED HOPEFUL AS WELL AS RESOLUTE TOOK HIS WAY BACK TO HIS LODGING WITH THE FEELING OF A MAN DEFEATED
