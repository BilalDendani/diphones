1695-142312-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT PROMISES FULFILLED THEN PROUDLY PROUDLY UP SHE ROSE
1695-142312-0001 WHATE'ER YE SAY THINK WHAT YE MAY YE'S GET NA WORD FRAE ME SCOTCH BALLAD IT WAS NOT MERELY THAT MARGARET WAS KNOWN TO MISTER THORNTON TO HAVE SPOKEN FALSELY THOUGH SHE IMAGINED THAT FOR THIS REASON ONLY WAS SHE SO TURNED IN HIS OPINION
1695-142312-0002 BUT THAT THIS FALSEHOOD OF HERS BORE A DISTINCT REFERENCE IN HIS MIND TO SOME OTHER LOVER HE COULD NOT FORGET THE FOND AND EARNEST LOOK THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HER AND SOME OTHER MAN THE ATTITUDE OF FAMILIAR CONFIDENCE IF NOT OF POSITIVE ENDEARMENT
1695-142312-0003 THE THOUGHT OF THIS PERPETUALLY STUNG HIM IT WAS A PICTURE BEFORE HIS EYES WHEREVER HE WENT AND WHATEVER HE WAS DOING IN ADDITION TO THIS AND HE GROUND HIS TEETH AS HE REMEMBERED IT WAS THE HOUR DUSKY TWILIGHT
1695-142312-0004 THE PLACE SO FAR AWAY FROM HOME AND COMPARATIVELY UNFREQUENTED HIS NOBLER SELF HAD SAID AT FIRST THAT ALL THIS LAST MIGHT BE ACCIDENTAL INNOCENT JUSTIFIABLE BUT ONCE ALLOW HER RIGHT TO LOVE AND BE BELOVED
1695-142312-0005 AND HAD HE ANY REASON TO DENY HER RIGHT HAD NOT HER WORDS BEEN SEVERELY EXPLICIT WHEN SHE CAST HIS LOVE AWAY FROM HER SHE MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN BEGUILED INTO A LONGER WALK ON TO A LATER HOUR THAN SHE HAD ANTICIPATED BUT THAT FALSEHOOD
1695-142312-0006 WHICH SHOWED A FATAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOMETHING WRONG AND TO BE CONCEALED WHICH WAS UNLIKE HER HE DID HER THAT JUSTICE THOUGH ALL THE TIME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A RELIEF TO BELIEVE HER UTTERLY UNWORTHY OF HIS ESTEEM IT WAS THIS THAT MADE THE MISERY
1695-142312-0007 THAT HE PASSIONATELY LOVED HER AND THOUGHT HER EVEN WITH ALL HER FAULTS MORE LOVELY AND MORE EXCELLENT THAN ANY OTHER WOMAN YET HE DEEMED HER SO ATTACHED TO SOME OTHER MAN SO LED AWAY BY HER AFFECTION FOR HIM AS TO VIOLATE HER TRUTHFUL NATURE
1695-142312-0008 THE VERY FALSEHOOD THAT STAINED HER WAS A PROOF HOW BLINDLY SHE LOVED ANOTHER THIS DARK SLIGHT ELEGANT HANDSOME MAN WHILE HE HIMSELF WAS ROUGH AND STERN AND STRONGLY MADE
1695-142312-0009 HE LASHED HIMSELF INTO AN AGONY OF FIERCE JEALOUSY HE THOUGHT OF THAT LOOK THAT ATTITUDE HOW HE WOULD HAVE LAID HIS LIFE AT HER FEET FOR SUCH TENDER GLANCES SUCH FOND DETENTION HE MOCKED AT HIMSELF
1695-142312-0010 FOR HAVING VALUED THE MECHANICAL WAY IN WHICH SHE HAD PROTECTED HIM FROM THE FURY OF THE MOB NOW HE HAD SEEN HOW SOFT AND BEWITCHING SHE LOOKED WHEN WITH A MAN SHE REALLY LOVED HE REMEMBERED POINT BY POINT THE SHARPNESS OF HER WORDS
1695-142312-0011 WAS NOT A MAN IN ALL THAT CROWD FOR WHOM SHE WOULD NOT HAVE DONE AS MUCH FAR MORE READILY THAN FOR HIM HE SHARED WITH THE MOB IN HER DESIRE OF AVERTING BLOODSHED FROM THEM BUT THIS MAN THIS HIDDEN LOVER SHARED WITH NOBODY
1695-142312-0012 HE HAD LOOKS WORDS HAND CLEAVINGS LIES CONCEALMENT ALL TO HIMSELF MISTER THORNTON WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO IRRITABLE AS HE WAS NOW IN ALL HIS LIFE LONG
1695-142312-0013 HE FELT INCLINED TO GIVE A SHORT ABRUPT ANSWER MORE LIKE A BARK THAN A SPEECH TO EVERY ONE THAT ASKED HIM A QUESTION AND THIS CONSCIOUSNESS HURT HIS PRIDE
1695-142312-0014 SO THE MANNER WAS SUBDUED TO A QUIET DELIBERATION BUT THE MATTER WAS EVEN HARDER AND STERNER THAN COMMON HE WAS MORE THAN USUALLY SILENT AT HOME EMPLOYING HIS EVENINGS IN A CONTINUAL PACE BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS
1695-142312-0015 WHICH WOULD HAVE ANNOYED HIS MOTHER EXCEEDINGLY IF IT HAD BEEN PRACTISED BY ANY ONE ELSE AND DID NOT TEND TO PROMOTE ANY FORBEARANCE ON HER PART EVEN TO THIS BELOVED SON CAN YOU STOP CAN YOU SIT DOWN FOR A MOMENT I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU
1695-142312-0016 IF YOU WOULD GIVE UP THAT EVERLASTING WALK WALK WALK HE SAT DOWN INSTANTLY ON A CHAIR AGAINST THE WALL
1695-142312-0017 SHE SAYS SHE MUST LEAVE US THAT HER LOVER'S DEATH HAS SO AFFECTED HER SPIRITS SHE CAN'T GIVE HER HEART TO HER WORK VERY WELL I SUPPOSE OTHER COOKS ARE TO BE MET WITH THAT'S SO LIKE A MAN IT'S NOT MERELY THE COOKING
1695-142312-0018 IT IS THAT SHE KNOWS ALL THE WAYS OF THE HOUSE BESIDES SHE TELLS ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR FRIEND MISS HALE MISS HALE IS NO FRIEND OF MINE MISTER HALE IS MY FRIEND
1695-142312-0019 FOR IF SHE HAD BEEN YOUR FRIEND WHAT BETSY SAYS WOULD HAVE ANNOYED YOU LET ME HEAR IT SAID HE WITH THE EXTREME QUIETNESS OF MANNER HE HAD BEEN ASSUMING FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS
1695-142312-0020 BETSY SAYS THAT THE NIGHT ON WHICH HER LOVER I FORGET HIS NAME FOR SHE ALWAYS CALLS HIM HE LEONARDS THE NIGHT ON WHICH LEONARDS WAS LAST SEEN AT THE STATION WHEN HE WAS LAST SEEN ON DUTY IN FACT MISS HALE WAS THERE
1695-142312-0021 WALKING ABOUT WITH A YOUNG MAN WHO BETSY BELIEVES KILLED LEONARDS BY SOME BLOW OR PUSH LEONARDS WAS NOT KILLED BY ANY BLOW OR PUSH HOW DO YOU KNOW BECAUSE I DISTINCTLY PUT THE QUESTION TO THE SURGEON OF THE INFIRMARY
1695-142312-0022 HE TOLD ME THERE WAS AN INTERNAL DISEASE OF LONG STANDING CAUSED BY LEONARDS HABIT OF DRINKING TO EXCESS THAT THE FACT OF HIS BECOMING RAPIDLY WORSE WHILE IN A STATE OF INTOXICATION SETTLED THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THE LAST FATAL ATTACK WAS CAUSED BY EXCESS OF DRINKING OR THE FALL
1695-142312-0023 CAUSED BY THE BLOW OR PUSH OF WHICH BETSY SPEAKS THEN THERE WAS A BLOW OR PUSH I BELIEVE SO AND WHO DID IT AS THERE WAS NO INQUEST IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DOCTOR'S OPINION I CANNOT TELL YOU
1695-142312-0024 BUT MISS HALE WAS THERE NO ANSWER AND WITH A YOUNG MAN STILL NO ANSWER AT LAST HE SAID I TELL YOU MOTHER
1695-142312-0025 NO JUDICIAL INQUIRY I MEAN BETSY SAYS THAT WOOLMER
1695-142312-0026 CAN SWEAR THAT MISS HALE WAS AT THE STATION AT THAT HOUR WALKING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WITH A YOUNG MAN I DON'T SEE WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH THAT MISS HALE IS AT LIBERTY TO PLEASE HERSELF
1695-142312-0027 SAID MISSUS THORNTON EAGERLY IT CERTAINLY SIGNIFIES VERY LITTLE TO US NOT AT ALL TO YOU AFTER WHAT HAS PASSED BUT I I MADE A PROMISE TO MISSUS HALE THAT I WOULD NOT ALLOW HER DAUGHTER TO GO WRONG WITHOUT ADVISING AND REMONSTRATING WITH HER
1695-142312-0028 I SHALL CERTAINLY LET HER KNOW MY OPINION OF SUCH CONDUCT I DO NOT SEE ANY HARM IN WHAT SHE DID THAT EVENING SAID MISTER THORNTON GETTING UP AND COMING NEAR TO HIS MOTHER HE STOOD BY THE CHIMNEY PIECE WITH HIS FACE TURNED AWAY FROM THE ROOM
1695-142312-0029 IN THE FIRST PLACE AS IT IS NOT MANY YEARS SINCE I MYSELF WAS A DRAPER'S ASSISTANT THE MERE CIRCUMSTANCE OF A GROCER'S ASSISTANT NOTICING ANY ACT DOES NOT ALTER THE CHARACTER OF THE ACT TO ME
1695-142312-0030 AND IN THE NEXT PLACE I SEE A GREAT DEAL OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MISS HALE AND FANNY I CAN IMAGINE THAT THE ONE MAY HAVE WEIGHTY REASONS WHICH MAY AND OUGHT TO MAKE HER OVERLOOK ANY SEEMING IMPROPRIETY IN HER CONDUCT I NEVER KNEW FANNY HAVE WEIGHTY REASONS FOR ANYTHING
1695-142312-0031 OTHER PEOPLE MUST GUARD HER I BELIEVE MISS HALE IS A GUARDIAN TO HERSELF A PRETTY CHARACTER OF YOUR SISTER INDEED REALLY JOHN ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT MISS HALE HAD DONE ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU CLEAR SIGHTED
1695-142312-0032 SHE DREW YOU ON TO AN OFFER BY A BOLD DISPLAY OF PRETENDED REGARD FOR YOU TO PLAY YOU OFF AGAINST THIS VERY YOUNG MAN I'VE NO DOUBT HER WHOLE CONDUCT IS CLEAR TO ME NOW YOU BELIEVE HE IS HER LOVER I SUPPOSE YOU AGREE TO THAT HE TURNED ROUND TO HIS MOTHER
1695-142312-0033 HIS FACE WAS VERY GRAY AND GRIM YES MOTHER I DO BELIEVE HE IS HER LOVER WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN HE TURNED ROUND AGAIN
1695-142312-0034 HE LEANT HIS FACE AGAINST HIS HAND THEN BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK HE TURNED SHARP AGAIN MOTHER HE IS HER LOVER WHOEVER HE IS BUT SHE MAY NEED HELP AND WOMANLY COUNSEL THERE MAY BE DIFFICULTIES OR TEMPTATIONS WHICH I DON'T KNOW
1695-142312-0035 I FEAR THERE ARE I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE BUT AS YOU HAVE EVER BEEN A GOOD AY AND A TENDER MOTHER TO ME GO TO HER AND GAIN HER CONFIDENCE
1695-142312-0036 I KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG SOME DREAD MUST BE A TERRIBLE TORTURE TO HER FOR GOD'S SAKE JOHN SAID HIS MOTHER NOW REALLY SHOCKED WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT DO YOU KNOW
1695-142312-0037 HE DID NOT REPLY TO HER JOHN I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHAN'T THINK UNLESS YOU SPEAK YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY WHAT YOU HAVE DONE AGAINST HER NOT AGAINST HER MOTHER I COULD NOT SPEAK AGAINST HER WELL
1695-142312-0038 YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY WHAT YOU HAVE DONE UNLESS YOU SAY MORE THESE HALF EXPRESSIONS ARE WHAT RUIN A WOMAN'S CHARACTER HER CHARACTER MOTHER YOU DO NOT DARE HE FACED ABOUT AND LOOKED INTO HER FACE WITH HIS FLAMING EYES THEN
1695-142312-0039 DRAWING HIMSELF UP INTO DETERMINED COMPOSURE AND DIGNITY HE SAID I WILL NOT SAY ANY MORE THAN THIS WHICH IS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN THE SIMPLE TRUTH AND I AM SURE YOU BELIEVE ME
1695-142312-0040 I HAVE GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT MISS HALE IS IN SOME STRAIT AND DIFFICULTY CONNECTED WITH AN ATTACHMENT WHICH OF ITSELF FROM MY KNOWLEDGE OF MISS HALE'S CHARACTER IS PERFECTLY INNOCENT AND RIGHT WHAT MY REASON IS I REFUSE TO TELL
1695-142312-0041 IMPLYING ANY MORE SERIOUS IMPUTATION THAN THAT SHE NOW NEEDS THE COUNSEL OF SOME KIND AND GENTLE WOMAN YOU PROMISED MISSUS HALE TO BE THAT WOMAN NO SAID MISSUS THORNTON I AM HAPPY TO SAY I DID NOT PROMISE KINDNESS AND GENTLENESS
1695-142312-0042 I PROMISED COUNSEL AND ADVICE SUCH AS I WOULD GIVE TO MY OWN DAUGHTER I SHALL SPEAK TO HER AS I WOULD DO TO FANNY
1695-142312-0043 I SHALL SPEAK WITH RELATION TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES I KNOW WITHOUT BEING INFLUENCED EITHER ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BY THE STRONG REASONS WHICH YOU WILL NOT CONFIDE TO ME
1695-142312-0044 SHE WILL NEVER BEAR IT SAID HE PASSIONATELY SHE WILL HAVE TO BEAR IT IF I SPEAK IN HER DEAD MOTHER'S NAME WELL SAID HE BREAKING AWAY DON'T TELL ME ANY MORE ABOUT IT I CANNOT ENDURE TO THINK OF IT
1695-142312-0045 IT WILL BE BETTER THAT YOU SHOULD SPEAK TO HER ANY WAY THAN THAT SHE SHOULD NOT BE SPOKEN TO AT ALL
1695-142312-0046 CONTINUED HE BETWEEN HIS TEETH AS HE BOLTED HIMSELF INTO HIS OWN PRIVATE ROOM AND THAT CURSED LIE WHICH SHOWED SOME TERRIBLE SHAME IN THE BACKGROUND TO BE KEPT FROM THE LIGHT IN WHICH I THOUGHT SHE LIVED PERPETUALLY
1695-142312-0047 MARGARET MOTHER HOW YOU HAVE TORTURED ME
1695-142312-0048 I AM BUT UNCOUTH AND HARD BUT I WOULD NEVER HAVE LED YOU INTO ANY FALSEHOOD FOR ME THE MORE MISSUS THORNTON THOUGHT OVER WHAT HER SON HAD SAID IN PLEADING FOR A MERCIFUL JUDGMENT FOR MARGARET'S INDISCRETION THE MORE BITTERLY SHE FELT INCLINED TOWARDS HER
1695-142312-0049 SHE TOOK A SAVAGE PLEASURE IN THE IDEA OF SPEAKING HER MIND TO HER IN THE GUISE OF FULFILMENT OF A DUTY
1695-142312-0050 SHE SNORTED SCORNFULLY OVER THE PICTURE OF THE BEAUTY OF HER VICTIM HER JET BLACK HAIR HER CLEAR SMOOTH SKIN HER LUCID EYES WOULD NOT HELP TO SAVE HER ONE WORD OF THE JUST AND STERN REPROACH
1695-142312-0051 WHICH MISSUS THORNTON SPENT HALF THE NIGHT IN PREPARING TO HER MIND IS MISS HALE WITHIN
1695-142312-0052 MARGARET WAS SITTING ALONE WRITING TO EDITH AND GIVING HER MANY PARTICULARS OF HER MOTHER'S LAST DAYS IT WAS A SOFTENING EMPLOYMENT AND SHE HAD TO BRUSH AWAY THE UNBIDDEN TEARS AS MISSUS THORNTON WAS ANNOUNCED
1695-142312-0053 SHE WAS SO GENTLE AND LADYLIKE IN HER MODE OF RECEPTION THAT HER VISITOR WAS SOMEWHAT DAUNTED AND IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO UTTER THE SPEECH SO EASY OF ARRANGEMENT WITH NO ONE TO ADDRESS IT TO MARGARET'S LOW RICH VOICE WAS SOFTER THAN USUAL HER MANNER MORE GRACIOUS
1695-142312-0054 BECAUSE IN HER HEART SHE WAS FEELING VERY GRATEFUL TO MISSUS THORNTON FOR THE COURTEOUS ATTENTION OF HER CALL SHE EXERTED HERSELF TO FIND SUBJECTS OF INTEREST FOR CONVERSATION PRAISED MARTHA THE SERVANT WHOM MISSUS THORNTON HAD FOUND FOR THEM
1695-142312-0055 HAD ASKED EDITH FOR A LITTLE GREEK AIR ABOUT WHICH SHE HAD SPOKEN TO MISS THORNTON MISSUS THORNTON WAS FAIRLY DISCOMFITED HER SHARP DAMASCUS BLADE SEEMED OUT OF PLACE AND USELESS AMONG ROSE LEAVES SHE WAS SILENT BECAUSE SHE WAS TRYING TO TASK HERSELF UP TO HER DUTY
1695-142312-0056 AT LAST SHE STUNG HERSELF INTO ITS PERFORMANCE BY A SUSPICION WHICH IN SPITE OF ALL PROBABILITY SHE ALLOWED TO CROSS HER MIND THAT ALL THIS SWEETNESS WAS PUT ON WITH A VIEW OF PROPITIATING MISTER THORNTON THAT SOMEHOW THE OTHER ATTACHMENT HAD FALLEN THROUGH
1695-142312-0057 AND THAT IT SUITED MISS HALE'S PURPOSE TO RECALL HER REJECTED LOVER POOR MARGARET THERE WAS PERHAPS SO MUCH TRUTH IN THE SUSPICION AS THIS THAT MISSUS THORNTON WAS THE MOTHER OF ONE WHOSE REGARD SHE VALUED AND FEARED TO HAVE LOST
1695-142312-0058 AND THIS THOUGHT UNCONSCIOUSLY ADDED TO HER NATURAL DESIRE OF PLEASING ONE WHO WAS SHOWING HER KINDNESS BY HER VISIT MISSUS THORNTON STOOD UP TO GO BUT YET SHE SEEMED TO HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO SAY
1695-142312-0059 SHE CLEARED HER THROAT AND BEGAN MISS HALE I HAVE A DUTY TO PERFORM I PROMISED YOUR POOR MOTHER THAT AS FAR AS MY POOR JUDGMENT WENT I WOULD NOT ALLOW YOU TO ACT IN ANY WAY WRONGLY OR SHE SOFTENED HER SPEECH DOWN A LITTLE HERE
1695-142312-0060 INADVERTENTLY WITHOUT REMONSTRATING AT LEAST WITHOUT OFFERING ADVICE WHETHER YOU TOOK IT OR NOT MARGARET STOOD BEFORE HER BLUSHING LIKE ANY CULPRIT WITH HER EYES DILATING AS SHE GAZED AT MISSUS THORNTON
1695-142312-0061 SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD COME TO SPEAK TO HER ABOUT THE FALSEHOOD SHE HAD TOLD THAT MISTER THORNTON HAD EMPLOYED HER TO EXPLAIN THE DANGER SHE HAD EXPOSED HERSELF TO OF BEING CONFUTED IN FULL COURT
1695-142312-0062 AND ALTHOUGH HER HEART SANK TO THINK HE HAD NOT RATHER CHOSEN TO COME HIMSELF AND UPBRAID HER AND RECEIVE HER PENITENCE AND RESTORE HER AGAIN TO HIS GOOD OPINION YET SHE WAS TOO MUCH HUMBLED NOT TO BEAR ANY BLAME ON THIS SUBJECT PATIENTLY AND MEEKLY
1695-142312-0063 MISSUS THORNTON WENT ON AT FIRST WHEN I HEARD FROM ONE OF MY SERVANTS THAT YOU HAD BEEN SEEN WALKING ABOUT WITH A GENTLEMAN SO FAR FROM HOME AS THE OUTWOOD STATION AT SUCH A TIME OF THE EVENING I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT
1695-142312-0064 BUT MY SON I AM SORRY TO SAY CONFIRMED HER STORY IT WAS INDISCREET TO SAY THE LEAST MANY A YOUNG WOMAN HAS LOST HER CHARACTER BEFORE NOW MARGARET'S EYES FLASHED FIRE THIS WAS A NEW IDEA THIS WAS TOO INSULTING
1695-142312-0065 IF MISSUS THORNTON HAD SPOKEN TO HER ABOUT THE LIE SHE HAD TOLD WELL AND GOOD SHE WOULD HAVE OWNED IT AND HUMILIATED HERSELF BUT TO INTERFERE WITH HER CONDUCT TO SPEAK OF HER CHARACTER
1695-142312-0066 SHE WOULD NOT ANSWER HER NOT ONE WORD MISSUS THORNTON SAW THE BATTLE SPIRIT IN MARGARET'S EYES AND IT CALLED UP HER COMBATIVENESS ALSO FOR YOUR MOTHER'S SAKE I HAVE THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO WARN YOU AGAINST SUCH IMPROPRIETIES
1695-142312-0067 THEY MUST DEGRADE YOU IN THE LONG RUN IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD EVEN IF IN FACT THEY DO NOT LEAD YOU TO POSITIVE HARM FOR MY MOTHER'S SAKE SAID MARGARET IN A TEARFUL VOICE I WILL BEAR MUCH BUT I CANNOT BEAR EVERYTHING
1695-142312-0068 SHE NEVER MEANT ME TO BE EXPOSED TO INSULT I AM SURE INSULT MISS HALE YES MADAM SAID MARGARET MORE STEADILY IT IS INSULT WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF ME THAT SHOULD LEAD YOU TO SUSPECT OH
1695-142312-0069 SAID SHE BREAKING DOWN AND COVERING HER FACE WITH HER HANDS
1695-142312-0070 MISTER THORNTON HAS TOLD YOU NO MISS HALE SAID MISSUS THORNTON HER TRUTHFULNESS CAUSING HER TO ARREST THE CONFESSION MARGARET WAS ON THE POINT OF MAKING THOUGH HER CURIOSITY WAS ITCHING TO HEAR IT STOP MISTER THORNTON HAS TOLD ME NOTHING
1695-142312-0071 YOU DO NOT KNOW MY SON YOU ARE NOT WORTHY TO KNOW HIM HE SAID THIS
1695-142312-0072 WHAT SORT OF A MAN YOU REJECTED THIS MILTON MANUFACTURER HIS GREAT TENDER HEART SCORNED AS IT WAS SCORNED SAID TO ME ONLY LAST NIGHT GO TO HER I HAVE GOOD REASON TO KNOW THAT SHE IS IN SOME STRAIT
1695-142312-0073 ARISING OUT OF SOME ATTACHMENT AND SHE NEEDS WOMANLY COUNSEL I BELIEVE THOSE WERE HIS VERY WORDS FARTHER THAN THAT
1695-142312-0074 NOT ONE WORD AGAINST YOU IF HE HAS KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING WHICH SHOULD MAKE YOU SOB SO HE KEEPS IT TO HIMSELF MARGARET'S FACE WAS STILL HIDDEN IN HER HANDS THE FINGERS OF WHICH WERE WET WITH TEARS MISSUS THORNTON WAS A LITTLE MOLLIFIED COME MISS HALE
1695-142312-0075 THERE MAY BE CIRCUMSTANCES I'LL ALLOW THAT IF EXPLAINED MAY TAKE OFF FROM THE SEEMING IMPROPRIETY STILL NO ANSWER MARGARET WAS CONSIDERING WHAT TO SAY SHE WISHED TO STAND WELL WITH MISSUS THORNTON
1695-142312-0076 AND YET SHE COULD NOT MIGHT NOT GIVE ANY EXPLANATION MISSUS THORNTON GREW IMPATIENT I SHALL BE SORRY TO BREAK OFF AN ACQUAINTANCE BUT FOR FANNY'S SAKE AS I TOLD MY SON IF FANNY HAD DONE SO WE SHOULD CONSIDER IT A GREAT DISGRACE
1695-142312-0077 AND FANNY MIGHT BE LED AWAY I CAN GIVE YOU NO EXPLANATION SAID MARGARET IN A LOW VOICE I HAVE DONE WRONG BUT NOT IN THE WAY YOU THINK OR KNOW ABOUT I THINK MISTER THORNTON JUDGES ME MORE MERCIFULLY THAN YOU
1695-142312-0078 YOU MEAN TO DO RIGHTLY THANK YOU SAID MISSUS THORNTON DRAWING HERSELF UP I WAS NOT AWARE THAT MY MEANING WAS DOUBTED IT IS THE LAST TIME I SHALL INTERFERE I WAS UNWILLING TO CONSENT TO DO IT WHEN YOUR MOTHER ASKED ME
1695-142312-0079 YOU DID NOT APPEAR TO ME WORTHY OF HIM BUT WHEN YOU COMPROMISED YOURSELF AS YOU DID AT THE TIME OF THE RIOT AND EXPOSED YOURSELF TO THE COMMENTS OF SERVANTS AND WORKPEOPLE I FELT IT WAS NO LONGER RIGHT TO SET MYSELF AGAINST MY SON'S WISH OF PROPOSING TO YOU A WISH BY THE WAY
1695-142312-0080 WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS DENIED ENTERTAINING UNTIL THE DAY OF THE RIOT MARGARET WINCED AND DREW IN HER BREATH WITH A LONG HISSING SOUND OF WHICH HOWEVER MISSUS THORNTON TOOK NO NOTICE HE CAME YOU HAD APPARENTLY CHANGED YOUR MIND
1695-142312-0081 I TOLD MY SON YESTERDAY THAT I THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE SHORT AS WAS THE INTERVAL YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OR LEARNT SOMETHING OF THIS OTHER LOVER WHAT MUST YOU THINK OF ME MADAM ASKED MARGARET THROWING HER HEAD BACK WITH PROUD DISDAIN TILL HER THROAT CURVED OUTWARDS LIKE A SWAN'S
1695-142312-0082 YOU CAN SAY NOTHING MORE MISSUS THORNTON I DECLINE EVERY ATTEMPT TO JUSTIFY MYSELF FOR ANYTHING YOU MUST ALLOW ME TO LEAVE THE ROOM AND SHE SWEPT OUT OF IT WITH THE NOISELESS GRACE OF AN OFFENDED PRINCESS
1695-142312-0083 SHE WAS NOT PARTICULARLY ANNOYED AT MARGARET'S WAY OF BEHAVING SHE DID NOT CARE ENOUGH FOR HER FOR THAT SHE HAD TAKEN MISSUS THORNTON'S REMONSTRANCE TO THE FULL AS KEENLY TO HEART AS THAT LADY EXPECTED AND MARGARET'S PASSION AT ONCE MOLLIFIED HER VISITOR FAR MORE THAN ANY SILENCE OR RESERVE COULD HAVE DONE
1695-142312-0084 IT SHOWED THE EFFECT OF HER WORDS MY YOUNG LADY THOUGHT MISSUS THORNTON TO HERSELF YOU'VE A PRETTY GOOD TEMPER OF YOUR OWN IF JOHN AND YOU HAD COME TOGETHER HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO KEEP A TIGHT HAND OVER YOU TO MAKE YOU KNOW YOUR PLACE
1695-142312-0085 BUT I DON'T THINK YOU WILL GO A WALKING AGAIN WITH YOUR BEAU AT SUCH AN HOUR OF THE DAY IN A HURRY YOU'VE TOO MUCH PRIDE AND SPIRIT IN YOU FOR THAT I LIKE TO SEE A GIRL FLY OUT AT THE NOTION OF BEING TALKED ABOUT IT SHOWS THEY'RE NEITHER GIDDY NOR BOLD BY NATURE AS FOR THAT GIRL
1695-142312-0086 SHE MIGHT BE BOLD BUT SHE'D NEVER BE GIDDY I'LL DO HER THAT JUSTICE NOW AS TO FANNY SHE'D BE GIDDY AND NOT BOLD SHE'S NO COURAGE IN HER POOR THING MISTER THORNTON WAS NOT SPENDING THE MORNING SO SATISFACTORILY AS HIS MOTHER
1695-142312-0087 SHE AT ANY RATE WAS FULFILLING HER DETERMINED PURPOSE HE WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE HE STOOD WHAT DAMAGE THE STRIKE HAD DONE HIM A GOOD DEAL OF HIS CAPITAL WAS LOCKED UP IN NEW AND EXPENSIVE MACHINERY
1695-142312-0088 THE STRIKE HAD THROWN HIM TERRIBLY BEHINDHAND AS TO THE COMPLETION OF THESE ORDERS EVEN WITH HIS OWN ACCUSTOMED AND SKILLED WORKPEOPLE HE WOULD HAVE HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN FULFILLING HIS ENGAGEMENTS AS IT WAS
1695-142312-0089 THE INCOMPETENCE OF THE IRISH HANDS WHO HAD TO BE TRAINED TO THEIR WORK AT A TIME REQUIRING UNUSUAL ACTIVITY WAS A DAILY ANNOYANCE IT WAS NOT A FAVOURABLE HOUR FOR HIGGINS TO MAKE HIS REQUEST BUT HE HAD PROMISED MARGARET TO DO IT AT ANY COST
1695-142312-0090 SO THOUGH EVERY MOMENT ADDED TO HIS REPUGNANCE HIS PRIDE AND HIS SULLENNESS OF TEMPER HE STOOD LEANING AGAINST THE DEAD WALL HOUR AFTER HOUR FIRST ON ONE LEG THEN ON THE OTHER
1695-142312-0091 CAN'T STAY NOW MY MAN I'M TOO LATE AS IT IS
1695-142312-0092 MISTER THORNTON WAS HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET HIGGINS SIGHED BUT IT WAS NO USE
1695-142312-0093 IF HE HAD RUNG THE LODGE BELL OR EVEN GONE UP TO THE HOUSE TO ASK FOR HIM
1695-142312-0094 SO HE STOOD STILL AGAIN VOUCHSAFING NO ANSWER BUT A SHORT NOD OF RECOGNITION TO THE FEW MEN WHO KNEW AND SPOKE TO HIM AS THE CROWD DROVE OUT OF THE MILLYARD AT DINNER TIME
1695-142312-0095 AT LAST MISTER THORNTON RETURNED WHAT YOU THERE STILL
1695-142312-0096 THESE GOOD PEOPLE I SEE ARE AT DINNER SAID HE CLOSING THE DOOR OF THE PORTER'S LODGE
1695-142312-0097 THAT THAT MAN IS HIGGINS ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE UNION HE THAT MADE THAT SPEECH IN HURSTFIELD NO I DIDN'T SAID MISTER THORNTON LOOKING ROUND SHARPLY AT HIS FOLLOWER HIGGINS WAS KNOWN TO HIM BY NAME AS A TURBULENT SPIRIT COME ALONG
1695-142312-0098 SAID HE AND HIS TONE WAS ROUGHER THAN BEFORE IT IS MEN SUCH AS THIS THOUGHT HE WHO INTERRUPT COMMERCE AND INJURE THE VERY TOWN THEY LIVE IN
1695-142312-0099 SAID MISTER THORNTON FACING ROUND AT HIM AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN THE COUNTING HOUSE OF THE MILL MY NAME IS HIGGINS' I KNOW THAT BROKE IN MISTER THORNTON
1695-142312-0100 I WANT WORK WORK YOU'RE A PRETTY CHAP TO COME ASKING ME FOR WORK YOU DON'T WANT IMPUDENCE THAT'S VERY CLEAR I'VE GETTEN ENEMIES AND BACKBITERS LIKE MY BETTERS
1695-142312-0101 SAID HIGGINS HIS BLOOD WAS A LITTLE ROUSED BY MISTER THORNTON'S MANNER MORE THAN BY HIS WORDS MISTER THORNTON SAW A LETTER ADDRESSED TO HIMSELF ON THE TABLE HE TOOK IT UP AND READ IT THROUGH AT THE END HE LOOKED UP AND SAID
1695-142312-0102 AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION I AXED I GAVE IT YOU BEFORE DON'T WASTE ANY MORE OF YOUR TIME YO MADE A REMARK SIR ON MY IMPUDENCE BUT I WERE TAUGHT THAT IT WAS MANNERS TO SAY EITHER YES OR NO WHEN I WERE AXED A CIVIL QUESTION

1695-142312-0104 WORST THEY COULD SAY OF ME IS THAT I DID WHAT I THOUGHT BEST EVEN TO MY OWN WRONG YOU'D BETTER GO AND TRY THEM THEN AND SEE WHETHER THEY'LL GIVE YOU WORK I'VE TURNED OFF UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED OF MY BEST HANDS FOR NO OTHER FAULT THAN FOLLOWING YOU AND SUCH AS YOU
1695-142312-0105 I MIGHT AS WELL PUT A FIREBRAND INTO THE MIDST OF THE COTTON WASTE HIGGINS TURNED AWAY THEN THE RECOLLECTION OF BOUCHER CAME OVER HIM AND HE FACED ROUND WITH THE GREATEST CONCESSION HE COULD PERSUADE HIMSELF TO MAKE
1695-142312-0106 AND I'D PROMISE MORE I'D PROMISE THAT WHEN I SEED YO GOING WRONG AND ACTING UNFAIR

1695-142312-0110 SPECIALLY WHEN I CAN KEEP FRO DRINK AND THAT I SHALL DO NOW IF I NE'ER DID AFORE THAT YOU MAY HAVE MORE MONEY LAID UP FOR ANOTHER STRIKE I SUPPOSE NO I'D BE THANKFUL IF I WAS FREE TO DO THAT
1695-142312-0111 WELL YOU'D BETTER TURN TO SOMETHING ELSE IF YOU'VE ANY SUCH GOOD INTENTION IN YOUR HEAD
1695-142312-0112 A PRETTY NAVVY YOU'D MAKE WHY YOU COULDN'T DO HALF A DAY'S WORK AT DIGGING AGAINST AN IRISHMAN

1695-142312-0114 THINK HOW YOU'D ABUSE ANY POOR FELLOW WHO WAS WILLING TO TAKE WHAT HE COULD GET TO KEEP HIS OWN CHILDREN YOU AND YOUR UNION WOULD SOON BE DOWN UPON HIM NO NO IF IT'S ONLY FOR THE RECOLLECTION OF THE WAY IN WHICH YOU'VE USED THE POOR KNOBSTICKS BEFORE NOW I SAY NO TO YOUR QUESTION I'LL NOT GIVE YOU WORK

1695-142312-0118 MISTER THORNTON DID NOT DEIGN A REPLY BUT LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW A MINUTE AFTER HE WAS STRUCK WITH THE LEAN BENT FIGURE GOING OUT OF THE YARD THE HEAVY WALK WAS IN STRANGE CONTRAST WITH THE RESOLUTE CLEAR DETERMINATION OF THE MAN TO SPEAK TO HIM
1695-142312-0119 HE CROSSED TO THE PORTER'S LODGE HOW LONG HAS THAT MAN HIGGINS BEEN WAITING TO SPEAK TO ME
