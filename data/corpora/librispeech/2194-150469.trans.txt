2194-150469-0000 AS THE TSAR RODE UP TO ONE FLANK OF THE BATTALIONS WHICH PRESENTED ARMS ANOTHER GROUP OF HORSEMEN GALLOPED UP TO THE OPPOSITE FLANK AND AT THE HEAD OF THEM ROSTOV RECOGNIZED NAPOLEON IT COULD BE NO ONE ELSE
2194-150469-0001 HE WAS RIDING A VERY FINE THOROUGHBRED GRAY ARAB HORSE WITH A CRIMSON GOLD EMBROIDERED SADDLECLOTH ON APPROACHING ALEXANDER HE RAISED HIS HAT AND AS HE DID SO ROSTOV WITH HIS CAVALRYMAN'S EYE
2194-150469-0002 COULD NOT HELP NOTICING THAT NAPOLEON DID NOT SIT WELL OR FIRMLY IN THE SADDLE THE BATTALIONS SHOUTED HURRAH AND VIVE L'EMPEREUR NAPOLEON SAID SOMETHING TO ALEXANDER AND BOTH EMPERORS DISMOUNTED AND TOOK EACH OTHER'S HANDS
2194-150469-0003 NAPOLEON'S FACE WORE AN UNPLEASANT AND ARTIFICIAL SMILE ALEXANDER WAS SAYING SOMETHING AFFABLE TO HIM IN SPITE OF THE TRAMPLING OF THE FRENCH GENDARMES HORSES WHICH WERE PUSHING BACK THE CROWD
2194-150469-0004 ROSTOV KEPT HIS EYES ON EVERY MOVEMENT OF ALEXANDER AND BONAPARTE IT STRUCK HIM AS A SURPRISE THAT ALEXANDER TREATED BONAPARTE AS AN EQUAL AND THAT THE LATTER WAS QUITE AT EASE WITH THE TSAR AS IF SUCH RELATIONS WITH AN EMPEROR WERE AN EVERYDAY MATTER TO HIM
2194-150469-0005 APPROACHED THE RIGHT FLANK OF THE PREOBRAZHENSK BATTALION AND CAME STRAIGHT UP TO THE CROWD STANDING THERE THE CROWD UNEXPECTEDLY FOUND ITSELF SO CLOSE TO THE EMPERORS THAT ROSTOV STANDING IN THE FRONT ROW WAS AFRAID HE MIGHT BE RECOGNIZED
2194-150469-0006 SIRE I ASK YOUR PERMISSION TO PRESENT THE LEGION OF HONOR TO THE BRAVEST OF YOUR SOLDIERS SAID A SHARP PRECISE VOICE ARTICULATING EVERY LETTER THIS WAS SAID BY THE UNDERSIZED NAPOLEON LOOKING UP STRAIGHT INTO ALEXANDER'S EYES
2194-150469-0007 ALEXANDER LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO WHAT WAS SAID TO HIM AND BENDING HIS HEAD SMILED PLEASANTLY TO HIM WHO HAS BORNE HIMSELF MOST BRAVELY IN THIS LAST WAR ADDED NAPOLEON
2194-150469-0008 WILL YOUR MAJESTY ALLOW ME TO CONSULT THE COLONEL SAID ALEXANDER AND TOOK A FEW HASTY STEPS TOWARD PRINCE KOZLOVSKI THE COMMANDER OF THE BATTALION BONAPARTE MEANWHILE BEGAN TAKING THE GLOVE OFF HIS SMALL WHITE HAND TORE IT IN DOING SO AND THREW IT AWAY
2194-150469-0009 AN AIDE DE CAMP BEHIND HIM RUSHED FORWARD AND PICKED IT UP TO WHOM SHALL IT BE GIVEN THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER ASKED KOSLOVSKI IN RUSSIAN IN A LOW VOICE TO WHOMEVER YOUR MAJESTY COMMANDS
2194-150469-0010 THE EMPEROR KNIT HIS BROWS WITH DISSATISFACTION AND GLANCING BACK REMARKED BUT WE MUST GIVE HIM AN ANSWER KOZLOVSKI SCANNED THE RANKS RESOLUTELY AND INCLUDED ROSTOV IN HIS SCRUTINY CAN IT BE ME THOUGHT ROSTOV
2194-150469-0011 CASTING A SIDELONG LOOK AT HIS COLONEL IN ALARM HIS FACE TWITCHED AS OFTEN HAPPENS TO SOLDIERS CALLED BEFORE THE RANKS NAPOLEON SLIGHTLY TURNED HIS HEAD AND PUT HIS PLUMP LITTLE HAND OUT BEHIND HIM AS IF TO TAKE SOMETHING
2194-150469-0012 THE MEMBERS OF HIS SUITE GUESSING AT ONCE WHAT HE WANTED MOVED ABOUT AND WHISPERED AS THEY PASSED SOMETHING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER AND A PAGE
2194-150469-0013 RAN FORWARD AND BOWING RESPECTFULLY OVER THE OUTSTRETCHED HAND AND NOT KEEPING IT WAITING A MOMENT LAID IN IT AN ORDER ON A RED RIBBON NAPOLEON WITHOUT LOOKING PRESSED TWO FINGERS TOGETHER AND THE BADGE WAS BETWEEN THEM
2194-150469-0014 AND THE SMALL WHITE HAND HOLDING THE ORDER TOUCHED ONE OF LAZAREV'S BUTTONS IT WAS AS IF NAPOLEON KNEW THAT IT WAS ONLY NECESSARY FOR HIS HAND TO DEIGN TO TOUCH THAT SOLDIER'S BREAST FOR THE SOLDIER TO BE FOREVER HAPPY REWARDED
2194-150469-0015 AND DISTINGUISHED FROM EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD NAPOLEON MERELY LAID THE CROSS ON LAZAREV'S BREAST AND DROPPING HIS HAND TURNED TOWARD ALEXANDER AS THOUGH SURE THAT THE CROSS WOULD ADHERE THERE AND IT REALLY DID
2194-150469-0016 LOOKED AGAIN STRAIGHT INTO ALEXANDER'S EYES AS IF ASKING WHETHER HE SHOULD STAND THERE OR GO AWAY OR DO SOMETHING ELSE BUT RECEIVING NO ORDERS HE REMAINED FOR SOME TIME IN THAT RIGID POSITION THE EMPERORS REMOUNTED AND RODE AWAY
2194-150469-0017 THE PREOBRAZHENSK BATTALION BREAKING RANK MINGLED WITH THE FRENCH GUARDS AND SAT DOWN AT THE TABLES PREPARED FOR THEM
2194-150469-0018 TWO OFFICERS WITH FLUSHED FACES LOOKING CHEERFUL AND HAPPY PASSED BY ROSTOV
2194-150469-0019 HAVE YOU SEEN LAZAREV I HAVE TOMORROW I HEAR THE PREOBRAZHENSKIS WILL GIVE THEM A DINNER YES BUT WHAT LUCK FOR LAZAREV TWELVE HUNDRED FRANCS PENSION FOR LIFE
2194-150469-0020 HERE'S A CAP LADS SHOUTED A PREOBRAZHENSK SOLDIER DONNING A SHAGGY FRENCH CAP IT'S A FINE THING FIRST RATE HAVE YOU HEARD THE PASSWORD ASKED ONE GUARDS OFFICER OF ANOTHER THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY IT WAS NAPOLEON FRANCE BRAVOURE
2194-150469-0021 YESTERDAY ALEXANDRE RUSSIE GRANDEUR ONE DAY OUR EMPEROR GIVES IT AND NEXT DAY NAPOLEON TOMORROW OUR EMPEROR WILL SEND A SAINT GEORGE'S CROSS TO THE BRAVEST OF THE FRENCH GUARDS IT HAS TO BE DONE HE MUST RESPOND IN KIND
2194-150469-0022 AND COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM ASKING WHAT WAS THE MATTER SO STRANGELY DISMAL AND TROUBLED WAS ROSTOV'S FACE NOTHING NOTHING REPLIED ROSTOV YOU'LL CALL ROUND YES I WILL ROSTOV STOOD AT THAT CORNER FOR A LONG TIME
2194-150469-0023 WATCHING THE FEAST FROM A DISTANCE IN HIS MIND A PAINFUL PROCESS WAS GOING ON WHICH HE COULD NOT BRING TO A CONCLUSION TERRIBLE DOUBTS ROSE IN HIS SOUL NOW HE REMEMBERED DENISOV WITH HIS CHANGED EXPRESSION HIS SUBMISSION
2194-150469-0024 AND THE WHOLE HOSPITAL WITH ARMS AND LEGS TORN OFF AND ITS DIRT AND DISEASE
2194-150469-0025 THAT HE LOOKED ROUND TO SEE WHERE THE SMELL CAME FROM NEXT HE THOUGHT OF THAT SELF SATISFIED BONAPARTE WITH HIS SMALL WHITE HAND WHO WAS NOW AN EMPEROR LIKED AND RESPECTED BY ALEXANDER THEN WHY THOSE SEVERED ARMS AND LEGS AND THOSE DEAD MEN
2194-150469-0026 THEN AGAIN HE THOUGHT OF LAZAREV REWARDED AND DENISOV PUNISHED AND UNPARDONED HE CAUGHT HIMSELF HARBORING SUCH STRANGE THOUGHTS THAT HE WAS FRIGHTENED
2194-150469-0027 TWO OFFICERS OF HIS OWN DIVISION JOINED HIM THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY TURNED ON THE PEACE THE OFFICERS HIS COMRADES LIKE MOST OF THE ARMY WERE DISSATISFIED WITH THE PEACE CONCLUDED AFTER THE BATTLE OF FRIEDLAND
2194-150469-0028 NICHOLAS ATE AND DRANK CHIEFLY THE LATTER IN SILENCE HE FINISHED A COUPLE OF BOTTLES OF WINE BY HIMSELF THE PROCESS IN HIS MIND WENT ON TORMENTING HIM WITHOUT REACHING A CONCLUSION
2194-150469-0029 HE FEARED TO GIVE WAY TO HIS THOUGHTS YET COULD NOT GET RID OF THEM SUDDENLY ON ONE OF THE OFFICERS SAYING THAT IT WAS HUMILIATING TO LOOK AT THE FRENCH ROSTOV BEGAN SHOUTING WITH UNCALLED FOR WRATH AND THEREFORE MUCH TO THE SURPRISE OF THE OFFICERS
2194-150469-0030 HOW CAN YOU JUDGE WHAT'S BEST HE CRIED THE BLOOD SUDDENLY RUSHING TO HIS FACE HOW CAN YOU JUDGE THE EMPEROR'S ACTIONS WHAT RIGHT HAVE WE TO ARGUE WE CANNOT COMPREHEND EITHER THE EMPEROR'S AIMS OR HIS ACTIONS
2194-150469-0031 BUT I NEVER SAID A WORD ABOUT THE EMPEROR SAID THE OFFICER JUSTIFYING HIMSELF AND UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND ROSTOV'S OUTBURST EXCEPT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT HE WAS DRUNK BUT ROSTOV DID NOT LISTEN TO HIM
2194-150469-0032 IF WE'RE PUNISHED IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE DESERVED IT IT'S NOT FOR US TO JUDGE IF THE EMPEROR PLEASES TO RECOGNIZE BONAPARTE AS EMPEROR AND TO CONCLUDE AN ALLIANCE WITH HIM IT MEANS THAT THAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO
