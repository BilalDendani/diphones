5809-58763-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN HOW DEW IS FORMED READER DID YOU EVER LIVE IN THE COUNTRY WERE YOU EVER AWAKENED EARLY ON A SUMMER'S MORNING TO GO FOR THE COWS DID YOU EVER WADE THROUGH A WHEAT FIELD IN JUNE
5809-58763-0001 OR THE LONG GRASS OF A MEADOW WHEN THE PEARLY DEWDROPS HUNG IN CLUSTERS ON THE BEARDED GRAIN SHINING LIKE BRILLIANTS IN THE MORNING SUN
5809-58763-0002 HAVE YOU NOT SEEN THE BLADES OF GRASS STUDDED WITH DIAMONDS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANY THAT EVER FLASHED IN THE DAZZLING LIGHT OF A BALLROOM IF NOT YOU HAVE MISSED A PICTURE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN HUNG ON THE WALLS OF YOUR MEMORY
5809-58763-0003 THAT NO ONE COULD ROB YOU OF EVERYONE HAS NOTICED THAT AT CERTAIN TIMES IN THE YEAR THE GRASS BECOMES WET IN THE EVENING AND GROWS MORE SO TILL THE SUN RISES THE NEXT DAY AND DISPELS THE MOISTURE AND THIS WHEN NO CLOUD IS SEEN
5809-58763-0004 IT WAS AS FAMILIAR TO THE ANCIENTS AS IT IS TO US AND YET IT IS ONLY ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF A CENTURY SINCE THE CAUSE OF IT HAS BEEN UNDERSTOOD WE EVEN YET SPEAK OF THE DEW FALLING LIKE RAIN
5809-58763-0005 IN FORMER TIMES SOME SCIENTISTS SUPPOSED THAT IT WAS A FINE RAIN THAT FELL FROM THE HIGHER REGIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE OTHERS SUPPOSED IT TO BE AN EMANATION FROM THE EARTH
5809-58763-0006 IN COLD WEATHER WE CALL IT FROST IT HAS BEEN STATED IN A FORMER CHAPTER ON EVAPORATION THAT THE CAPACITY OF THE AIR FOR HOLDING MOISTURE IN A TRANSPARENT FORM DEPENDS UPON ITS TEMPERATURE IF THE TEMPERATURE IS AT THE FREEZING POINT
5809-58763-0007 IF IT IS SIXTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT THE AIR WILL RETAIN SIX GRAINS OF TRANSPARENT MOISTURE TO THE SQUARE FOOT OF AIR WHILE AT EIGHTY DEGREES IT WILL CONTAIN NEARLY ELEVEN GRAINS
5809-58763-0008 WHEN THE AIR IS CHARGED WITH THIS VAPOR TO THE POINT OF SATURATION WHICH POINT VARIES WITH THE TEMPERATURE A SLIGHT DEPRESSION OF THE TEMPERATURE IS SUFFICIENT TO CONDENSE THIS VAPOR INTO CLOUD OR DROPS OF WATER
5809-58763-0009 BETWEEN EIGHTEEN TWELVE AND EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN DOCTOR WELLS MADE A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS WITH FLOCKS OF COTTON WOOL HE WEIGHED OUT PIECES OF EQUAL WEIGHT
5809-58763-0010 HE FOUND UPON WEIGHING THESE AFTER A NIGHT'S EXPOSURE UNDER A CLEAR SKY THAT THE COTTON WOOL ON TOP OF THE BOARD HAD GAINED FOURTEEN GRAINS IN WEIGHT FROM THE MOISTURE OR DEW THAT HAD FORMED UPON IT
5809-58763-0011 WHILE THE SAME AMOUNT OF COTTON ON THE UNDER SIDE OF THE BOARD HAD ONLY INCREASED FOUR GRAINS HE TRIED FURTHER EXPERIMENTS BY MAKING LITTLE PAPER HOUSES OR BOXES TO COVER A CERTAIN PORTION OF GRASS OR VEGETATION
5809-58763-0012 THERE WAS LITTLE OR NONE WITHIN THE INCLOSURE THESE EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED IN VARIOUS WAYS AND CLOSELY WATCHED TO SEE THAT NONE OF THE PHENOMENA WERE IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH FALLING RAIN
5809-58763-0013 THAT IS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY THE INHABITANTS OF HOT COUNTRIES IN THE MANUFACTURE OF ICE AND IN OUR OWN LAND FOR STORING IT PERHAPS EVERYONE WHO HAS LIVED IN THE COUNTRY HAS NOTICED THAT ON A SUMMER'S MORNING WHEN THE GRASS IS LADEN WITH DEWDROPS
5809-58763-0014 A GRAVEL WALK OR A DUSTY ROAD WILL BE PERFECTLY DRY THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE GRAVEL WILL RETAIN HEAT AND NOT RADIATE IT FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME THAN GRASS OR GREEN LEAVES DEW BEGINS TO FORM UPON THE GRASS VERY SOON AFTER THE SUN IS SET
5809-58763-0015 BECAUSE THE MOMENT THE SUN'S RAYS ARE WITHDRAWN THE HEAT IS RAPIDLY RADIATED BY THE BLADES OF GRASS WHICH COOLS THE EARTH UNDER IT AND THE AIR ABOVE AND SURROUNDING IT SO THAT IF THE AIR IS ANYWHERE NEAR THE MOISTURE SATURATION POINT
5809-58763-0016 ON COOLING AT THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND IT WILL READILY GIVE UP A PART OF ITS MOISTURE WHICH CONDENSES IN DROPS UPON THE BLADES OF GRASS IF THE NIGHT IS STILL AND CLEAR AND THERE IS MUCH MOISTURE IN THE AIR THE DEW WILL BE HEAVY
5809-58763-0017 BUT IF THE NIGHT IS CLOUDY THERE WILL BE LITTLE OR NO DEW FORMED THE CLOUDS FORM A SCREEN BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE UPPER REGIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH PREVENTS THE HEAT FROM RADIATING TO A SUFFICIENT EXTENT TO FORM DEW
5809-58763-0018 IT WILL REQUIRE A GREATER AMOUNT OF DEPRESSION OF TEMPERATURE TO CAUSE CONDENSATION AND THIS IS WHY WE USUALLY HAVE HEAVIER DEWS IN JUNE WHEN THE AIR IS MORE HIGHLY CHARGED WITH MOISTURE
5809-58763-0019 AND THE NECESSARY DEPRESSION IS NOT REACHED IN THESE CASES EXCEPT AT AN ALTITUDE OF SEVERAL MILES DOCTOR WELLS HAS SHOWN THAT IF WE TAKE THE READING OF TWO THERMOMETERS ON A CLEAR SUMMER NIGHT
5809-58763-0020 ONE OF THEM LYING ON THE GRASS AND THE OTHER SUSPENDED TWO FEET ABOVE IT WE SHALL FIND THAT THE ONE LYING ON THE GRASS WILL READ EIGHT OR TEN DEGREES LOWER THAN THE ONE SUSPENDED IN THE AIR IF THE NIGHT IS STILL
5809-58763-0021 THERE WILL BE A COLD STRATUM OF AIR NEXT TO THE EARTH
5809-58763-0022 AND DEW WILL FORM IF HOWEVER IT IS CLOUDY OR THE WIND IS BLOWING THERE IS RARELY ANY FORMATION OF DEW THE REASON IN THE FORMER CASE AS WE HAVE EXPLAINED IS THAT THE RADIATED HEAT IS HELD DOWN TO THE EARTH IN A MEASURE
5809-58763-0023 AND IN THE LATTER CASE THERE IS A CONSTANT CHANGE OF AIR SO THAT IN EITHER CASE NO PART OF IT IS ALLOWED TO COOL DOWN SUFFICIENTLY TO PRECIPITATE MOISTURE
5809-58763-0024 IT IS A CURIOUS FACT THAT OFTEN THERE WILL BE A HEAVIER DEW UNDER THE BLAZE OF A FULL MOON ON A CLEAR NIGHT THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME THE MOON HAS NO SCREENS ABOUT IT OF ANY KIND TO OBSTRUCT THE FREE RADIATION OF HEAT
5809-58763-0025 IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A DEAD CINDER FLOATING IN SPACE AND NOT SURROUNDED BY AN ATMOSPHERE SO THAT THE SUN'S RAYS HAVE FULL EFFECT UPON IT DURING THE TIME IT IS EXPOSED TO THEM
5809-58763-0026 AND AT THAT TIME IT BECOMES HEATED TO A TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING LIKE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT FOR HALF THE MONTH SAY THE SUN IS SHINING CONTINUOUSLY UPON ALL OR A PART OF IT
5809-58763-0027 IN OTHER WORDS THE DAYS AND NIGHTS OF THE MOON ARE ABOUT TWO WEEKS LONG THE MOON DOES NOT REVOLVE UPON ITS OWN AXIS LIKE THE EARTH THEREFORE THE SAME SIDE OR A PORTION OF IT IS EXPOSED TO THE SUN FOR FOURTEEN DAYS
5809-58763-0028 DURING THE TIME THAT THE MOON IS IN THE EARTH'S SHADOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO FALL TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN DEGREES BELOW ZERO WHICH IS TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN DEGREES BELOW THE FREEZING POINT WHEN THE MOON IS FULL
5809-58763-0029 AND IS HEATED UP TO OVER SEVEN HUNDRED DEGREES THERE IS SUFFICIENT HEAT RADIATING FROM IT TO BE FELT SENSIBLY UPON THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND IT WOULD BE FELT IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE GREAT ENVELOPE OF ATMOSPHERE
5809-58763-0030 THE HEAT COMING FROM A FULL MOON ON A CLEAR NIGHT IS ABSORBED IN CAUSING THE AQUEOUS VAPORS THAT ARE PARTLY CONDENSED IN THE HIGHER REGIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE TO BE REABSORBED INTO TRANSPARENT VAPOR
5809-58763-0031 THIS CLEARS AWAY THE HEAT SCREEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND ALLOWS RADIATION TO GO ON MORE RAPIDLY AT THE EARTH'S SURFACE AND THUS COOLS IT TO A GREATER EXTENT WHEN THE MOON IS SHINING BRIGHTLY THAN WHEN IT IS DARK AND IN THE SHADOW OF THE EARTH
5809-58763-0032 AS WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THE COLD THAT IS PRODUCED BY RADIATION THROUGH THE BLADES OF GRASS AND OTHER RADIATING SUBSTANCES MAY BE INDICATED BY PLACING ONE THERMOMETER ON THE GROUND AND FIXING ANOTHER AT SOME POINT IN THE AIR
5809-58763-0033 SOMETIMES THE DIFFERENCE IS VERY MARKED AMOUNTING TO AS MUCH AS TWENTY OR THIRTY DEGREES IF UNDER THESE CONDITIONS A CLOUD FLOATS OVERHEAD FORMING A HEAT SCREEN
5809-58763-0034 RADIATION INTO THE UPPER REGIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE IS CHECKED WHICH CAUSES A SUDDEN RISE IN THE TEMPERATURE NEAR THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS PRINCIPLE OF HEAT RADIATION FROM THE EARTH'S SURFACE
5809-58763-0035 AND IN A MEASURE PREVENT THE HEAT FROM RADIATING FROM THE EARTH IMMEDIATELY UNDER IT FROST WHICH OF COURSE IS BUT FROZEN DEW AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR WILL FORM ON A STILL AUTUMN NIGHT
5809-58763-0036 ALTHOUGH THE ATMOSPHERE AT SOME DISTANCE ABOVE THE GROUND IS SOME DEGREES ABOVE THE FREEZING POINT THE REASON FOR THIS WILL BE OBVIOUS WHEN WE CONSIDER THE FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN SET FORTH CONCERNING THE POWER OF RADIATION TO PRODUCE COLD
5809-58763-0037 IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED BY METEOROLOGISTS THAT THE AMOUNT OF WATER CONDENSED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IN THE FORM OF DEW AMOUNTS TO AS MUCH AS FIVE INCHES OR ABOUT ONE SEVENTH OF THE WHOLE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE THAT IS EVAPORATED INTO THE AIR
5809-58763-0038 IT WILL THUS BE SEEN THAT DEW PERFORMS AN IMPORTANT PART IN SUPPORTING VEGETATION THE SAME OPERATION IN NATURE'S GREAT WORKSHOP THAT FORMS THE DEWS OF SUMMER CREATES THE FROSTS OF WINTER
5809-58763-0039 HEAT RADIATION FROM THE EARTH GOES ON IN WINTER WHICH IS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT A THICK COVERING OF SNOW IS A GREAT BENEFIT TO VEGETATION AS A PROTECTION AGAINST THE INJURIOUS EFFECTS OF FROST
5809-58763-0040 THE WRITER HAS SEEN FLOWERS BLOOMING ABUNDANTLY AT AN ALTITUDE OF TWELVE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA LEVEL PROTECTED ONLY BY THE FRIENDLY SHELTER OF A SNOWBANK IN SOME CASES THE BLOOMING FLOWERS WERE IN ACTUAL CONTACT WITH THE SNOW
