3549-173591-0000 HOPES HAD BEEN DASHED AND WILD EXPECTATIONS HAD COME TO NAUGHT
3549-173591-0001 BUT A DULL EXILE IN A PETTY FORT BY A HOT AND SICKLY RIVER WITH HARD LABOR BAD FARE PROSPECTIVE FAMINE AND NOTHING TO BREAK THE WEARY SAMENESS BUT SOME PASSING CANOE OR FLOATING ALLIGATOR GATHERED IN KNOTS
3549-173591-0002 AND WHY IS HE ALWAYS CLOSETED WITH OTTIGNY ARLAC AND THIS AND THAT FAVORITE WHEN WE MEN OF BLOOD AS GOOD AS THEIRS CANNOT GAIN HIS EAR FOR A MOMENT THE YOUNG NOBLES OF WHOM THERE WERE MANY
3549-173591-0003 WERE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD PAID THEIR OWN EXPENSES IN EXPECTATION OF A GOLDEN HARVEST AND THEY CHAFED IN IMPATIENCE AND DISGUST THE RELIGIOUS ELEMENT IN THE COLONY UNLIKE THE FORMER HUGUENOT EMIGRATION TO BRAZIL WAS EVIDENTLY SUBORDINATE
3549-173591-0004 THE ADVENTURERS THOUGHT MORE OF THEIR FORTUNES THAN OF THEIR FAITH YET THERE WERE NOT A FEW EARNEST ENOUGH IN THE DOCTRINE OF GENEVA TO COMPLAIN LOUDLY AND BITTERLY THAT NO MINISTERS HAD BEEN SENT WITH THEM
3549-173591-0005 WAS BROUGHT TO A PARTIAL HEAD BY ONE LA ROQUETTE WHO GAVE OUT THAT HIGH UP THE RIVER HE HAD DISCOVERED BY MAGIC A MINE OF GOLD AND SILVER WHICH WOULD GIVE EACH OF THEM A SHARE OF TEN THOUSAND CROWNS
3549-173591-0006 BESIDES FIFTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THE KING BUT FOR LAUDONNIERE HE SAID THEIR FORTUNES WOULD ALL BE MADE HE FOUND AN ALLY IN A GENTLEMAN NAMED GENRE
3549-173591-0007 THAT I WOULD DEPRIVE THEM OF THIS GREAT GAME IN THAT I DID SET THEM DAYLY ON WORKE NOT SENDING THEM ON EVERY SIDE TO DISCOVER THE COUNTREYS THEREFORE THAT IT WERE A GOOD DEEDE TO DISPATCH MEE OUT OF THE WAY
3549-173591-0008 AND TO CHOOSE ANOTHER CAPTAINE IN MY PLACE THE SOLDIERS LISTENED TOO WELL THEY MADE A FLAG OF AN OLD SHIRT WHICH THEY CARRIED WITH THEM TO THE RAMPART WHEN THEY WENT TO THEIR WORK AT THE SAME TIME WEARING THEIR ARMS
3549-173591-0009 THEY TOOK A SMALL SPANISH VESSEL OFF THE COAST OF CUBA BUT WERE SOON COMPELLED BY FAMINE TO PUT INTO HAVANA AND GIVE THEMSELVES UP HERE TO MAKE THEIR PEACE WITH THE AUTHORITIES
3549-173591-0010 THEY TOLD ALL THEY KNEW OF THE POSITION AND PURPOSES OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN AT FORT CAROLINE AND THUS WAS FORGED THE THUNDERBOLT SOON TO BE HURLED AGAINST THE WRETCHED LITTLE COLONY ON A SUNDAY MORNING
3549-173591-0011 HE COMPLIED AND ISSUING FORTH HIS INSEPARABLE OTTIGNY AT HIS SIDE HE SAW SOME THIRTY OF HIS OFFICERS SOLDIERS AND GENTLEMEN VOLUNTEERS WAITING BEFORE THE BUILDING WITH FIXED AND SOMBRE COUNTENANCES LA CAILLE ADVANCING
3549-173591-0012 THAT THE PETITIONERS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO EMBARK IN THE VESSEL LYING IN THE RIVER AND CRUISE ALONG THE SPANISH MAIN IN ORDER TO PROCURE PROVISIONS BY PURCHASE OR OTHERWISE IN SHORT THE FLOWER OF THE COMPANY WISHED TO TURN BUCCANEERS
3549-173591-0013 LAUDONNIERE REFUSED BUT ASSURED THEM THAT AS SOON AS THE DEFENCES OF THE FORT SHOULD BE COMPLETED A SEARCH SHOULD BE BEGUN IN EARNEST FOR THE APPALACHIAN GOLD MINE AND THAT MEANWHILE TWO SMALL VESSELS THEN BUILDING ON THE RIVER SHOULD BE SENT ALONG THE COAST
3549-173591-0014 TO BARTER FOR PROVISIONS WITH THE INDIANS WITH THIS ANSWER THEY WERE FORCED TO CONTENT THEMSELVES
3549-173591-0015 AND THE BRAVE SWISS ARLAC WAS THE ONLY OFFICER WHO HELD TO HIS DUTY A SEVERE ILLNESS AGAIN SEIZED LAUDONNIERE AND CONFINED HIM TO HIS BED
3549-173591-0016 IMPROVING THEIR ADVANTAGE THE MALCONTENTS GAINED OVER NEARLY ALL THE BEST SOLDIERS IN THE FORT THE RINGLEADER WAS ONE FOURNEAUX A MAN OF GOOD BIRTH BUT WHOM LE MOYNE CALLS AN AVARICIOUS HYPOCRITE HE DREW UP A PAPER
3549-173591-0017 PUT HIM IN FETTERS CARRIED HIM OUT TO THE GATE OF THE FORT PLACED HIM IN A BOAT AND ROWED HIM TO THE SHIP ANCHORED IN THE RIVER TWO OTHER GANGS AT THE SAME TIME
3549-173591-0018 WHOM THEY DISARMED AND ORDERED TO KEEP THEIR ROOMS TILL THE NIGHT FOLLOWING ON PAIN OF DEATH SMALLER PARTIES WERE BUSIED MEANWHILE
3549-173591-0019 ON WHICH THE CARPENTERS HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME AT WORK
3549-173591-0020 OTTIGNY AND ARLAC WHO CONVEYED HIM TO THE FORT AND REINSTATED HIM THE ENTIRE COMMAND WAS REORGANIZED AND NEW OFFICERS APPOINTED THE COLONY WAS WOFULLY DEPLETED BUT THE BAD BLOOD HAD BEEN DRAWN OFF AND THENCEFORTH
3549-173591-0021 ALL INTERNAL DANGER WAS AT AN END IN FINISHING THE FORT IN BUILDING TWO NEW VESSELS TO REPLACE THOSE OF WHICH THEY HAD BEEN ROBBED AND IN VARIOUS INTERCOURSE WITH THE TRIBES FAR AND NEAR
3549-173591-0022 THEY PLUNDERED AND CAROUSED FOR A WEEK AND HAD HARDLY RE EMBARKED WHEN THEY MET A SMALL VESSEL HAVING ON BOARD THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND
3549-173591-0023 BUT WAS TAKEN AT LAST AND WITH HER A RICH BOOTY THEY THOUGHT TO PUT THE GOVERNOR TO RANSOM
3549-173591-0024 CONTRIVED TO SEND INSTRUCTIONS TO HIS WIFE HENCE IT HAPPENED THAT AT DAYBREAK THREE ARMED VESSELS FELL UPON THEM RETOOK THE PRIZE AND CAPTURED OR KILLED ALL THE PIRATES BUT TWENTY SIX WHO CUTTING THE MOORINGS OF THEIR BRIGANTINE FLED OUT TO SEA
3549-173591-0025 AND NOBLES AND SOLDIERS FRATERNIZING IN THE COMMON PERIL OF A HALTER JOINED IN A LAST CAROUSE AS THE WINE MOUNTED TO THEIR HEADS IN THE MIRTH OF DRINK AND DESPERATION THEY ENACTED THEIR OWN TRIAL ONE PERSONATED THE JUDGE
3549-173591-0026 ANOTHER THE COMMANDANT WITNESSES WERE CALLED WITH ARGUMENTS AND SPEECHES ON EITHER SIDE
3549-173591-0027 BUT IF LAUDONNIERE DOES NOT HANG US ALL I WILL NEVER CALL HIM AN HONEST MAN THEY HAD SOME HOPE OF GETTING PROVISIONS FROM THE INDIANS AT THE MONTH OF THE RIVER AND THEN PUTTING TO SEA AGAIN BUT THIS WAS FRUSTRATED BY LA CAILLE'S SUDDEN ATTACK
3549-173591-0028 A FILE OF MEN A RATTLING VOLLEY AND THE DEBT OF JUSTICE WAS PAID
