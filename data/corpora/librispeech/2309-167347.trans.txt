2309-167347-0000 THE SOFT BLUISH FOREST SHADOWS HAD LENGTHENED AND THE BARRED SUN RAYS FILTERING THROUGH WERE TINGED WITH A ROSY HUE BEFORE JAKE KLOON THE HOOTCH RUNNER AND EARL LEVERETT TRAP THIEF CAME TO DROWNED VALLEY
2309-167347-0001 THEY WERE STILL A MILE DISTANT FROM THE MOST SOUTHERN EDGE OF THAT VAST DESOLATION BUT ALREADY TAMARACKS APPEARED IN THE BEAUTY OF THEIR BURNT GOLD LITTLE POOLS GLIMMERED HERE AND THERE PATCHES OF AMBER SPHAGNUM AND CRIMSON PITCHER PLANTS BECAME FREQUENT
2309-167347-0002 AND ONCE OR TWICE KLOON'S BIG BOOTS BROKE THROUGH THE CRUST OF FALLEN LEAVES SOAKING HIM TO THE ANKLES WITH BLACK SILT LEVERETT ALWAYS A COWARD HAD PURSUED HIS DEVIOUS AND LARCENOUS WAY THROUGH THE WORLD ALWAYS IN DEADLY FEAR OF SINK HOLES
2309-167347-0003 HIS MOVEMENTS AND PATHS WERE THOSE OF A WEASEL PREFERRING ALWAYS SOLID GROUND BUT HE LACKED THE COURAGE OF THAT SINUOUS LITTLE BEAST THOUGH HE POSSESSED ALL OF ITS FEROCITY AND FAR MORE CUNNING NOW TROTTING LIGHTLY AND TIRELESSLY IN THE BROAD AND CARELESS SPOOR OF JAKE KLOON
2309-167347-0004 HIS NARROW POINTED HEAD ALERT AND EVERY FEAR SHARPENED INSTINCT TENSELY OBSERVANT THE TRAP THIEF CONTINUED TO MEDITATE MURDER LIKE ALL COWARDS HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN INCLINED TO BOLD AND RUTHLESS ACTION
2309-167347-0005 YET EVEN IN HIS PITIABLE MISDEMEANOURS HE SLUNK THROUGH LIFE IN TERROR OF THAT STRENGTH WHICH NEVER HESITATES AT VIOLENCE IN HIS PETTY PILFERING HE DIED A HUNDRED DEATHS FOR EVERY TRAPPED MINK OR OTTER HE FILCHED
2309-167347-0006 AS HE SLUNK FROM THE BAGGED TROUT BROOK OR CRAWLED AWAY BELLY DRAGGING AND POCKETS FULL OF SNARED GROUSE
2309-167347-0007 WHICH ALWAYS HE HAD HATED BECAUSE THEY SEEMED TO SPY ON HIM FROM THEIR SKY BLUE HEIGHTS
2309-167347-0008 ONE SHOT FROM BEHIND AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR IF IT PROVED A BETTER DEAL THE CONTENTS OF THE PACKET FOR IF QUINTANA'S BRIBERY HAD DAZZLED THEM
2309-167347-0009 ALWAYS IN HIS MEAN AND BUSY BRAIN HE WAS TRYING TO FIGURE TO HIMSELF WHAT THAT PACKET MUST CONTAIN AND TO MAKE THE BRIBE WORTH WHILE LEVERETT HAD CONCLUDED THAT ONLY A SOLID PACKET OF THOUSAND DOLLAR BILLS COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE TWENTY THOUSAND OFFERED
2309-167347-0010 THERE MIGHT EASILY BE HALF A MILLION IN BILLS PRESSED TOGETHER IN THAT HEAVY FLAT PACKET BILLS WERE ABSOLUTELY SAFE PLUNDER BUT KLOON HAD TURNED A DEAF EAR TO HIS SUGGESTIONS KLOON WHO NEVER ENTERTAINED AMBITIONS BEYOND HIS HOOTCH RAKE OFF
2309-167347-0011 WHOSE MISERABLE IMAGINATION STOPPED AT A WRETCHED PERCENTAGE SATISFIED ONE SHOT THERE WAS THE BACK OF KLOON'S BUSHY HEAD ONE SHOT AND FEAR WHICH HAD SHADOWED HIM FROM BIRTH WAS AT AN END FOREVER
2309-167347-0012 ENDED TOO PRIVATION THE BITTER RIGOUR OF BLACK WINTERS SCORCHING DAYS BODILY SQUALOR ILLS THAT SUCH AS HE ENDURED
2309-167347-0013 A SINGLE SHOT WOULD SETTLE ALL PROBLEMS FOR HIM BUT IF HE MISSED
2309-167347-0014 NO USE ALWAYS THE COWARD'S IF BLOCKED HIM AND THE COWARD'S RAGE FIERCEST OF ALL FURY RAVAGED HIM ALMOST CRAZING HIM WITH HIS OWN IMPOTENCE TAMARACKS SPHAGNUM CRIMSON PITCHER PLANTS GREW THICKER
2309-167347-0015 WE GOTTA TRAVEL A PIECE YET SAY JAKE BE YOU A MAN OR BE YOU A POOR DUMB CRITTER WHAT AIN'T GOT NO SPUNK
2309-167347-0016 I BET YOU IT'S THOUSAND DOLLAR BILLS MORE'N A BILLION MILLION DOLLARS LIKELY KLOON'S DOGGED SILENCE CONTINUED LEVERETT LICKED HIS DRY LIPS HIS RIFLE LAY ON HIS KNEES ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY HE MOVED IT MOVED IT AGAIN

2309-167347-0019 SOMETHING IN LEVERETT'S UNSTEADY VOICE MADE KLOON TURN HIS HEAD YOU GOL RAMMED FOOL HE SAID
2309-167347-0020 IN THE INTENSE STILLNESS OF THE PLACE SUDDENLY THE DEAD MAN MADE A SOUND AND THE TRAP ROBBER NEARLY FAINTED BUT IT WAS ONLY AIR ESCAPING FROM THE SLOWLY COLLAPSING LUNGS AND LEVERETT
2309-167347-0021 HIS EYES NEVER STIRRING FROM THE SPRAWLING THING ON THE GROUND
2309-167347-0022 THE SUN'S LEVEL RAYS GLIMMERED RUDDY THROUGH THE WOODS A GREEN FLY APPEARED BUZZING ABOUT THE DEAD MAN ANOTHER ZIG ZAGGED THROUGH THE SUNSHINE LACING IT WITH STREAKS OF GREENISH FIRE OTHERS APPEARED WHIRLING GYRATING FILLING THE SILENCE WITH THEIR HUMMING
2309-167347-0023 AND STILL LEVERETT DARED NOT BUDGE DARED NOT SEARCH THE DEAD AND TAKE FROM IT THAT FOR WHICH THE DEAD HAD DIED A LITTLE BREEZE CAME BY AND STIRRED THE BUSHY HAIR ON KLOON'S HEAD AND FLUTTERED THE FERNS AROUND HIM WHERE HE LAY
2309-167347-0024 TWO DELICATE PURE WHITE BUTTERFLIES RARE SURVIVORS OF A NATIVE SPECIES DRIVEN FROM CIVILIZATION INTO THE WILDERNESS BY THE ADVENT OF THE FOREIGN WHITE FLUTTERED IN AIRY PLAY OVER THE DEAD MAN
2309-167347-0025 SQUEAKING SQUEALING CHATTERING HIS OPINION OF MURDER AND LEVERETT SHAKING WITH THE SHOCK
2309-167347-0026 BUT AS HE BENT OVER HE CHANGED HIS MIND TURNED
2309-167347-0027 SEARCHING ABOUT HIM AS THOUGH SNIFFING IN A FEW MINUTES HE DISCOVERED WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR TOOK HIS BEARINGS CAREFULLY PICKED HIS WAY BACK OVER A LEAFY CRUST THAT TREMBLED UNDER HIS CAUTIOUS TREAD HE BENT OVER KLOON
2309-167347-0028 AND FROM THE LEFT INSIDE COAT POCKET HE DREW THE PACKET AND PLACED IT INSIDE HIS OWN FLANNEL SHIRT THEN TURNING HIS BACK TO THE DEAD HE SQUATTED DOWN AND CLUTCHED KLOON'S BURLY ANKLES AS A MAN GRASPS THE HANDLES OF A WHEELBARROW TO DRAW IT AFTER HIM
2309-167347-0029 DRAGGING ROLLING BUMPING OVER ROOTS JAKE KLOON TOOK HIS LAST TRAIL THROUGH THE WILDERNESS LEAVING A REDDER PATH THAN WAS LEFT BY THE SETTING SUN THROUGH FERN AND MOSS AND WASTES OF PITCHER PLANTS
2309-167347-0030 ALWAYS AS LEVERETT CREPT ON PULLING THE DEAD BEHIND HIM THE FLOOR OF THE WOODS TREMBLED SLIGHTLY AND A BLACK OOZE WET THE CRUST OF WITHERED LEAVES AT THE QUAKING EDGE OF A LITTLE POOL OF WATER LEVERETT HALTED
2309-167347-0031 THE WATER WAS DARK BUT SCARCELY AN INCH DEEP OVER ITS BLACK BED OF SILT BESIDE THIS SINK HOLE THE TRAP
2309-167347-0032 THE SAPLING WAS ABOUT TWENTY FEET IN HEIGHT LEVERETT THRUST THE BUTT OF IT INTO THE POOL WITHOUT ANY EFFORT HE PUSHED THE ENTIRE SAPLING OUT OF SIGHT IN THE DEPTHLESS SILT HE HAD TO MANOEUVRE VERY GINGERLY TO DUMP KLOON INTO THE POOL AND KEEP OUT OF IT HIMSELF
2309-167347-0033 DULLY IRIDESCENT FLOATED BROKE STRINGS OF BLOOD HUNG SUSPENDED IN THE CLOUDING WATER LEVERETT WENT BACK TO THE LITTLE RIDGE AND COVERED
2309-167347-0034 MUZZLE FIRST DRIVING IT DOWNWARD OUT OF SIGHT AS HE ROSE FROM THE POOL'S EDGE SOMEBODY LAID A HAND ON HIS SHOULDER THAT WAS THE MOST REAL DEATH THAT LEVERETT EVER HAD DIED TWO A COWARD DIES MANY TIMES BEFORE OLD MAN DEATH REALLY GETS HIM
2309-167347-0035 THE SWIMMING MINUTES PASSED HIS MIND CEASED TO LIVE FOR A SPACE THEN AS THROUGH THE SWIRLING WATERS OF THE LAST DARK WHIRLPOOL A DULLED ROAR OF RETURNING CONSCIOUSNESS FILLED HIS BEING SOMEBODY WAS SHAKING HIM SHOUTING AT HIM
2309-167347-0036 FOUGHT HIS WAY BLINDLY THROUGH TANGLED UNDERGROWTH TOWARD THE HARD RIDGE NO HUMAN POWER COULD HAVE BLOCKED THE FRANTIC CREATURE THRASHING TOWARD SOLID GROUND BUT THERE QUINTANA HELD HIM IN HIS WIRY GRIP FOOL MULE CRAZEE FELLOW
2309-167347-0037 FOR WHY YOU MAKE JUMPS LIKE RABBITS EH YOU EXPEC QUINTANA YES ALORS
