7314-93277-0000 TRIED TO DAMAGE THE AIRSHIP EH ASKED MISTER SHARP I WISH I'D CAUGHT THEM AT IT THE SCOUNDRELS BUT PERHAPS YOU HANDLED THEM AS WELL AS I COULD HAVE DONE I GUESS SO ASSENTED TOM I MUST SEE IF THEY DID CUT ANY OF THE WIRES BUT THE YOUNG INVENTOR AND HIS CHUM HAD ACTED TOO QUICKLY
7314-93277-0001 AND THEN WAS SENT IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS TO THE NO SMALL DELIGHT OF A LARGE CROWD THAT GATHERED IN THE MEADOW BACK OF THE SWIFT PROPERTY FOR IT ONLY REQUIRED THE SIGHT OF THE AIRSHIP LOOMING ITS BULK ABOVE THE FENCE AND BUILDINGS TO ATTRACT A THRONG
7314-93277-0002 IT IS SAFE TO SAY THIS TIME HOWEVER THAT ANDY FOGER AND HIS CRONIES WERE NOT IN THE AUDIENCE THEY WERE PROBABLY TOO BUSY REMOVING THE SOOT AND RED PAINT
7314-93277-0003 HE EVINCED NO GREAT ASTONISHMENT IN FACT HE SEEMED TO BE THINKING DEEPLY AND ON SOME SUBJECT NOT CONNECTED WITH AERONAUTICS TOM NOTICED THE ABSTRACTION OF HIS FATHER AND SHOOK HIS HEAD CLEARLY THE AGED INVENTOR WAS NOT HIS USUAL SELF AS FOR NED NEWTON
7314-93277-0004 HIS DELIGHT KNEW NO BOUNDS AT FIRST HE WAS A BIT APPREHENSIVE AS THE BIG SHIP WENT HIGHER AND HIGHER AND SWUNG ABOUT BUT HE SOON LOST HIS FEAR AND ENJOYED THE EXPERIENCE AS MUCH AS DID TOM THE YOUNG INVENTOR WAS BUSY HELPING MISTER SHARP MANAGE THE MACHINERY
7314-93277-0005 RUDDERS PLANES AND MOTOR A FLIGHT OF SEVERAL MILES WAS MADE AND TOM WAS WISHING THEY MIGHT PAY ANOTHER VISIT TO THE ROCKSMOND SEMINARY BUT MISTER SHARP AFTER COMPLETING SEVERAL EVOLUTIONS DESIGNED TO TEST THE STEERING QUALITIES OF THE CRAFT PUT BACK HOME
7314-93277-0006 WE'LL LAND IN THE MEADOW AND TRY RISING BY THE PLANES ALONE HE SAID IN THIS EVOLUTION IT WAS DEEMED BEST FOR MISTER SWIFT AND NED TO ALIGHT AS THERE WAS NO TELLING JUST HOW THE CRAFT WOULD BEHAVE TOM'S FATHER WAS VERY WILLING TO GET OUT
7314-93277-0007 THE MEN BOYS SEVERAL GIRLS AND WOMEN MADE A LIVING LANE THROUGH THIS SHOT THE CRAFT AND THEN WHEN SUFFICIENT MOMENTUM HAD BEEN OBTAINED TOM AT A COMMAND FROM THE AERONAUT PULLED THE LEVER OF THE ELEVATION RUDDER
7314-93277-0008 UP INTO THE AIR SHOT THE NOSE OF THE RED CLOUD AS THE WIND STRUCK THE SLANTING SURFACE OF THE PLANES AND A MOMENT LATER IT WAS SAILING HIGH ABOVE THE HEADS OF THE THRONG THAT'S THE STUFF CRIED MISTER SHARP IT WORKS AS WELL THAT WAY AS IT DOES WITH THE GAS
7314-93277-0009 HIGHER AND HIGHER IT WENT AND THEN COMING TO A LEVEL KEEL THE CRAFT WAS SENT HERE AND THERE DARTING ABOUT LIKE A BIRD AND GOING ABOUT IN HUGE CIRCLES START THE GAS MACHINE AND WE'LL COME TO REST IN THE AIR SAID THE BALLOONIST AND TOM DID SO
7314-93277-0010 AS THE POWERFUL VAPOR FILLED THE CONTAINER THE SHIP ACQUIRED A BUOYANCY AND THERE WAS NO NEED OF GOING AT HIGH SPEED IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN IT THE PROPELLERS WERE STOPPED AND THE RED CLOUD FLOATED TWO THOUSAND FEET IN THE AIR
7314-93277-0011 ONLY A LITTLE DISTANCE BELOW SOME FLEECY WHITE MASSES FROM WHICH SHE TOOK HER NAME THE DEMONSTRATION WAS A GREAT SUCCESS THE GAS WAS AGAIN ALLOWED TO ESCAPE THE PROPELLERS SET IN MOTION AND PURELY AS AN AEROPLANE THE SHIP WAS AGAIN SENT FORWARD
7314-93277-0012 BY MEANS OF THE PLANES AND RUDDERS A PERFECT LANDING WAS MADE IN THE MEADOW A SHORT DISTANCE FROM WHERE THE START HAD BEEN MADE THE CROWD CHEERED THE PLUCKY YOUTH AND MISTER SHARP NOW I'M READY TO GO ON A LONG TRIP ANY TIME YOU ARE TOM SAID THE AERONAUT THAT NIGHT
7314-93277-0013 HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIS FATHER'S CONDUCT WORK WAS STARTED THE NEXT DAY ON FITTING UP THE CAR OR CABIN OF THE AIRSHIP SO THAT SEVERAL PERSONS COULD LIVE EAT AND SLEEP IN IT FOR TWO WEEKS IF NECESSARY
7314-93277-0014 THE THIRD DAY AFTER THIS TASK HAD BEEN COMMENCED THE MAIL BROUGHT AN UNUSUAL COMMUNICATION TO TOM AND MISTER SHARP IT WAS FROM AN AERO CLUB OF BLAKEVILLE A CITY DISTANT ABOUT A HUNDRED MILES
7314-93277-0015 PRIZES WERE TO BE GIVEN AND THE INVENTORS OF THE RED CLOUD THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF WHICH THE COMMITTEE OF ARRANGEMENTS HAD HEARD WERE INVITED TO COMPETE SHALL WE GO IN FOR IT TOM ASKED THE BALLOONIST I'M WILLING IF YOU ARE THEN LET'S DO IT
7314-93277-0016 WE'LL SEE HOW OUR CRAFT SHOWS UP ALONGSIDE OF OTHERS I KNOW SOMETHING OF THIS CLUB IT IS ALL RIGHT BUT THE CARNIVAL IS LIKELY TO BE A SMALL ONE ONCE I GAVE A BALLOON EXHIBITION FOR THEM
7314-93277-0017 WELL WE'LL HAVE A TRY AT IT WON'T DO US ANY HARM TO WIN A PRIZE THEN FOR A LONG TRIP AS IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE THE CAR OR CABIN COMPLETELY FITTED UP IN ORDER TO COMPETE FOR THE PRIZE
7314-93277-0018 WORK IN THAT DIRECTION WAS SUSPENDED FOR THE TIME BEING AND MORE ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THE ENGINE THE PLANES AND RUDDERS SOME CHANGES WERE MADE AND A WEEK LATER THE RED CLOUD DEPARTED FOR BLAKEVILLE AS THE RULES OF THE CONTEST REQUIRED THREE PASSENGERS
7314-93277-0019 NED NEWTON WAS TAKEN ALONG MISTER SWIFT HAVING ARRANGED WITH THE BANK PRESIDENT SO THAT THE LAD COULD HAVE A FEW DAYS OFF
7314-93277-0020 HAVING BEEN DELAYED ON THE TRIP BY A BROKEN COG WHEEL WHICH WAS MENDED IN MID AIR AS THE THREE NAVIGATORS APPROACHED THEY SAW A SMALL MACHINE FLYING AROUND THE GROUNDS LOOK CRIED NED EXCITEDLY WHAT A SMALL AIRSHIP
7314-93277-0021 THAT'S A MONOPLANE DECLARED TOM WHO WAS GETTING TO BE QUITE AN EXPERT YES THE SAME KIND THAT WAS USED TO CROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL INTERJECTED MISTER SHARP THEY'RE TOO UNCERTAIN FOR MY PURPOSES THOUGH THEY ARE ALL RIGHT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS
7314-93277-0022 HARDLY HAD HE SPOKEN THAN A PUFF OF WIND CAUSED THE DARING MANIPULATOR OF THE MONOPLANE TO SWERVE TO ONE SIDE HE HAD TO MAKE A QUICK DESCENT SO RAPID WAS IT IN FACT THAT THE TIPS OF ONE OF HIS PLANES WAS SMASHED
7314-93277-0023 IT'LL TAKE HIM A DAY TO REPAIR THAT COMMENTED THE AERONAUT DRYLY THE RED CLOUD CREATED A SENSATION AS SHE SLOWLY SETTLED DOWN
7314-93277-0024 TOM'S CRAFT WAS EASILY THE BEST ONE AT THE CARNIVAL SO FAR THOUGH THE MANAGERS SAID OTHER MACHINES WERE ON THE WAY THE EXHIBITION OPENED THE NEXT DAY BUT NO FLIGHTS WERE TO BE ATTEMPTED UNTIL THE DAY FOLLOWING TWO MORE CRAFTS ARRIVED A LARGE TRIPLANE
7314-93277-0025 AND A DIRIGIBLE BALLOON THERE WERE MANY VISITORS TO THE GROUND AND TOM NED AND MISTER SHARP WERE KEPT BUSY ANSWERING QUESTIONS PUT BY THOSE WHO CROWDED INTO THEIR TENT TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THE DAY A FUSSY LITTLE FRENCHMAN ENTERED
7314-93277-0026 AND MAKING HIS WAY TO WHERE TOM STOOD ASKED AIR YOU ZE OWNAIR OF ZIS MACHINE ONE OF THEM REPLIED THE LAD HA
7314-93277-0027 ZEN I CHALLENGE YOU TO A RACE I HAVE A MONOPLANE ZAT IS ZE SWIFTEST EVAIRE
7314-93277-0028 AND FARTHER ZAN YOU SHALL WE TAKE HIM UP MISTER SHARP ASKED TOM WE'LL RACE WITH HIM AFTER WE GET THROUGH WITH THE CLUB ENTRIES DECIDED THE AERONAUT BUT NOT FOR MONEY IT'S AGAINST MY PRINCIPLES AND I DON'T BELIEVE YOUR FATHER WOULD LIKE IT
7314-93277-0029 RACING FOR PRIZES IS A DIFFERENT THING WELL WE WILL DEVOTE ZE MONEY TO CHARITY CONCEDED THE FRENCHMAN THIS WAS A DIFFERENT MATTER AND ONE TO WHICH MISTER SHARP DID NOT OBJECT
7314-93277-0030 SO IT WAS ARRANGED THAT A TRIAL SHOULD TAKE PLACE AFTER THE REGULAR AFFAIRS THAT NIGHT WAS SPENT IN GETTING THE RED CLOUD IN SHAPE FOR THE CONTESTS OF THE NEXT DAY SHE WAS GROOMED UNTIL EVERY WIRE WAS TAUT AND EVERY COG LEVER AND VALVE WORKING PERFECTLY
7314-93277-0031 NED NEWTON HELPED ALL HE COULD SO MUCH HAS APPEARED IN THE NEWSPAPERS OF THE RACES AT BLAKEVILLE THAT I WILL NOT DEVOTE MUCH SPACE HERE TO THEM SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT THE RED CLOUD EASILY DISTANCED THE BIG DIRIGIBLE FROM WHICH MUCH WAS EXPECTED
7314-93277-0032 IT WAS A CLOSER CONTEST WITH THE LARGE TRIPLANE BUT TOM'S AIRSHIP WON AND WAS GIVEN THE PRIZE A FINE SILVER CUP AS THE CARNIVAL WAS A SMALL ONE NO OTHER CRAFT IN A CLASS WITH THE RED CLOUD HAD BEEN ENTERED
7314-93277-0033 SO TOM AND MISTER SHARP HAD TO BE CONTENT WITH THE ONE RACE THEY WON THERE WERE OTHER CONTESTS AMONG MONOPLANES AND BIPLANES AND THE LITTLE FRENCHMAN WON TWO RACES
7314-93277-0034 AS HE ALIGHTED FROM HIS MONOPLANE WHILE AN ASSISTANT FILLED THE GASOLENE TANK I WILL IN CIRCLES GO AROUND YOU UP AND DOWN
7314-93277-0035 AND PRESTO I AM BACK AT ZE STARTING PLACE BEFORE YOU HAVE BEGUN ZEN CHARITY SHALL BE ZE RICHAIR ALL RIGHT WAIT AND SEE SAID TOM EASILY BUT THOUGH HE SHOWED MUCH CONFIDENCE HE ASKED MISTER SHARP IN PRIVATE JUST BEFORE THE IMPROMPTU CONTEST
7314-93277-0036 DO YOU THINK WE CAN BEAT HIM WELL SAID THE AERONAUT SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS YOU CAN'T TELL MUCH ABOUT THE AIR HIS MACHINE CERTAINLY GOES VERY FAST BUT TOO MUCH WIND WILL BE THE UNDOING OF HIM WHILE IT WILL ONLY HELP US AND I THINK HE ADDED
7314-93277-0037 THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET A BREEZE IT WAS ARRANGED THAT THE RED CLOUD WOULD START FROM THE GROUND WITHOUT THE USE OF THE GAS SO AS TO MAKE THE MACHINES MORE EVEN AT THE SIGNAL OFF THEY STARTED THE MOTORS MAKING A GREAT RACKET
7314-93277-0038 THE AERONAUT NODDED GRIMLY AND TURNED MORE GASOLENE INTO THE TWENTY CYLINDERED ENGINE LIKE A FLASH THE RED CLOUD DARTED FORWARD BUT THE FRENCHMAN ALSO INCREASED HIS SPEED AND DID ACTUALLY AT FIRST CIRCLE AROUND THE BIGGER MACHINE
7314-93277-0039 FOR HIS AFFAIR WAS MUCH LIGHTER BUT WHEN HE TRIED TO REPEAT THAT FEAT HE FOUND THAT HE WAS BEING LEFT BEHIND THAT'S THE STUFF WE'RE WINNING YELLED TOM NED JOINING IN THE SHOUT THEN CAME A PUFF OF WIND
7314-93277-0040 THE MONOPLANE HAD TO DESCEND FOR IT WAS IN DANGER OF TURNING TURTLE STILL THE NAVIGATOR WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE UP HE FLEW ALONG AT A LOWER LEVEL THEN MISTER SHARP OPENED UP THE RED CLOUD'S ENGINE AT FULL SPEED
7314-93277-0041 MISTER SHARP SAID NOTHING BUT WITH A QUEER SMILE ON HIS FACE HE SENT THE AIRSHIP DOWN TOWARD THE EARTH A MOMENT LATER HE WAS DIRECTLY UNDER THE MONOPLANE THEN QUICKLY RISING
7314-93277-0042 HE FAIRLY CAUGHT THE FRENCHMAN'S MACHINE ON TOP OF A SQUARE PLATFORM OF THE GAS CONTAINER THE BICYCLE WHEELS OF THE MONOPLANE RESTING ON THE FLAT SURFACE AND SO SWIFTLY DID THE RED CLOUD FLY ALONG THAT IT CARRIED THE MONOPLANE WITH IT
7314-93277-0043 WINNING OF COURSE BY A LARGE MARGIN HA A TRICK I RACE YOU TO MORROW AND AGAIN TO MORROW CRIED THE BEATEN FRENCHMAN AS HE ALIGHTED NO THANKS ANSWERED TOM WE'VE HAD ENOUGH I GUESS CHARITY WILL BE SATISFIED
