3835-178028-0000 NEXT DAY DURING THE SERVICE AT THE PALACE CHURCH IN HONOR OF THE EMPEROR'S BIRTHDAY PRINCE VOLKONSKI WAS CALLED OUT OF THE CHURCH AND RECEIVED A DISPATCH FROM PRINCE KUTUZOV IT WAS KUTUZOV'S REPORT WRITTEN FROM TATARINOVA ON THE DAY OF THE BATTLE
3835-178028-0001 KUTUZOV WROTE THAT THE RUSSIANS HAD NOT RETREATED A STEP THAT THE FRENCH LOSSES WERE MUCH HEAVIER THAN OURS AND THAT HE WAS WRITING IN HASTE FROM THE FIELD OF BATTLE BEFORE COLLECTING FULL INFORMATION IT FOLLOWED THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A VICTORY AND AT ONCE WITHOUT LEAVING THE CHURCH
3835-178028-0002 THANKS WERE RENDERED TO THE CREATOR FOR HIS HELP AND FOR THE VICTORY ANNA PAVLOVNA'S PRESENTIMENT WAS JUSTIFIED AND ALL THAT MORNING A JOYOUSLY FESTIVE MOOD REIGNED IN THE CITY EVERYONE BELIEVED THE VICTORY TO HAVE BEEN COMPLETE
3835-178028-0003 AND SOME EVEN SPOKE OF NAPOLEON'S HAVING BEEN CAPTURED OF HIS DEPOSITION AND OF THE CHOICE OF A NEW RULER FOR FRANCE IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR EVENTS TO BE REFLECTED IN THEIR REAL STRENGTH AND COMPLETENESS AMID THE CONDITIONS OF COURT LIFE AND FAR FROM THE SCENE OF ACTION
3835-178028-0004 GENERAL EVENTS INVOLUNTARILY GROUP THEMSELVES AROUND SOME PARTICULAR INCIDENT SO NOW THE COURTIERS PLEASURE WAS BASED AS MUCH ON THE FACT THAT THE NEWS HAD ARRIVED ON THE EMPEROR'S BIRTHDAY AS ON THE FACT OF THE VICTORY ITSELF
3835-178028-0005 IT WAS LIKE A SUCCESSFULLY ARRANGED SURPRISE MENTION WAS MADE IN KUTUZOV'S REPORT OF THE RUSSIAN LOSSES
3835-178028-0006 IN THE PETERSBURG WORLD THIS SAD SIDE OF THE AFFAIR AGAIN INVOLUNTARILY CENTERED ROUND A SINGLE INCIDENT KUTAYSOV'S DEATH EVERYBODY KNEW HIM THE EMPEROR LIKED HIM AND HE WAS YOUNG AND INTERESTING THAT DAY EVERYONE MET WITH THE WORDS
3835-178028-0007 WHAT A WONDERFUL COINCIDENCE JUST DURING THE SERVICE BUT WHAT A LOSS KUTAYSOV IS HOW SORRY I AM WHAT DID I TELL ABOUT KUTUZOV PRINCE VASILI NOW SAID WITH A PROPHET'S PRIDE I ALWAYS SAID HE WAS THE ONLY MAN CAPABLE OF DEFEATING NAPOLEON
3835-178028-0008 BUT NEXT DAY NO NEWS ARRIVED FROM THE ARMY AND THE PUBLIC MOOD GREW ANXIOUS THE COURTIERS SUFFERED BECAUSE OF THE SUFFERING THE SUSPENSE OCCASIONED THE EMPEROR FANCY THE EMPEROR'S POSITION SAID THEY AND INSTEAD OF EXTOLLING KUTUZOV AS THEY HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE
3835-178028-0009 THEY CONDEMNED HIM AS THE CAUSE OF THE EMPEROR'S ANXIETY THAT DAY PRINCE VASILI NO LONGER BOASTED OF HIS PROTEGE KUTUZOV BUT REMAINED SILENT WHEN THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF WAS MENTIONED MOREOVER TOWARD EVENING
3835-178028-0010 A TERRIBLE PIECE OF NEWS WAS ADDED
3835-178028-0011 HAD SUDDENLY DIED OF THAT TERRIBLE MALADY IT HAD BEEN SO AGREEABLE TO MENTION OFFICIALLY AT LARGE GATHERINGS
3835-178028-0012 HAD PRESCRIBED SMALL DOSES OF A CERTAIN DRUG TO PRODUCE A CERTAIN EFFECT BUT HELENE TORTURED BY THE FACT THAT THE OLD COUNT SUSPECTED HER AND THAT HER HUSBAND TO WHOM SHE HAD WRITTEN THAT WRETCHED PROFLIGATE PIERRE HAD NOT REPLIED
3835-178028-0013 HAD SUDDENLY TAKEN A VERY LARGE DOSE OF THE DRUG AND HAD DIED IN AGONY BEFORE ASSISTANCE COULD BE RENDERED HER IT WAS SAID THAT PRINCE VASILI AND THE OLD COUNT HAD TURNED UPON THE ITALIAN BUT THE LATTER HAD PRODUCED SUCH LETTERS FROM THE UNFORTUNATE DECEASED THAT THEY HAD IMMEDIATELY LET THE MATTER DROP
3835-178028-0014 AND THE DEATH OF HELENE ON THE THIRD DAY AFTER KUTUZOV'S REPORT A COUNTRY GENTLEMAN ARRIVED FROM MOSCOW AND NEWS OF THE SURRENDER OF MOSCOW TO THE FRENCH SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE TOWN THIS WAS TERRIBLE WHAT A POSITION FOR THE EMPEROR TO BE IN
3835-178028-0015 KUTUZOV WAS A TRAITOR AND PRINCE VASILI DURING THE VISITS OF CONDOLENCE PAID TO HIM ON THE OCCASION OF HIS DAUGHTER'S DEATH SAID OF KUTUZOV WHOM HE HAD FORMERLY PRAISED IT WAS EXCUSABLE FOR HIM IN HIS GRIEF TO FORGET WHAT HE HAD SAID
3835-178028-0016 THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPECT ANYTHING ELSE FROM A BLIND AND DEPRAVED OLD MAN I ONLY WONDER THAT THE FATE OF RUSSIA COULD HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED TO SUCH A MAN AS LONG AS THIS NEWS REMAINED UNOFFICIAL IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DOUBT IT BUT THE NEXT DAY THE FOLLOWING COMMUNICATION WAS RECEIVED FROM COUNT ROSTOPCHIN
3835-178028-0017 SIRE KUTUZOV'S ACTION DECIDES THE FATE OF THE CAPITAL AND OF YOUR EMPIRE RUSSIA WILL SHUDDER TO LEARN OF THE ABANDONMENT OF THE CITY IN WHICH HER GREATNESS IS CENTERED AND IN WHICH LIE THE ASHES OF YOUR ANCESTORS I SHALL FOLLOW THE ARMY I HAVE HAD EVERYTHING REMOVED
3835-178028-0018 AND IT ONLY REMAINS FOR ME TO WEEP OVER THE FATE OF MY FATHERLAND ON RECEIVING THIS DISPATCH THE EMPEROR SENT PRINCE VOLKONSKI TO KUTUZOV WITH THE FOLLOWING RESCRIPT PRINCE MICHAEL ILARIONOVICH SINCE THE TWENTY NINTH OF AUGUST
3835-178028-0019 I HAVE RECEIVED NO COMMUNICATION FROM YOU YET ON THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER I RECEIVED FROM THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF MOSCOW
3835-178028-0020 THE SAD NEWS THAT YOU WITH THE ARMY HAVE DECIDED TO ABANDON MOSCOW
