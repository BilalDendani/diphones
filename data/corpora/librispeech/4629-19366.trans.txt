4629-19366-0000 AND THE LAW OF GRAVITATION WE LEFT NEWTON AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THREE ON THE VERGE OF DISCOVERING THE MECHANISM OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM DETERRED THEREFROM ONLY BY AN ERROR IN THE THEN IMAGINED SIZE OF THE EARTH
4629-19366-0001 HE HAD PROVED FROM KEPLER'S LAWS THAT A CENTRIPETAL FORCE DIRECTED TO THE SUN AND VARYING AS THE INVERSE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE FROM THAT BODY WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THE OBSERVED PLANETARY MOTIONS AND THAT A SIMILAR FORCE DIRECTED TO THE EARTH
4629-19366-0002 HE WAS LED BY THE THEN RECEIVED NOTION THAT SIXTY MILES MADE A DEGREE ON THE EARTH'S SURFACE INTO AN ERRONEOUS ESTIMATE OF THE SIZE OF THE MOON'S ORBIT BEING THUS BAFFLED IN OBTAINING SUCH VERIFICATION HE LAID THE MATTER ASIDE FOR A TIME
4629-19366-0003 THE ANECDOTE OF THE APPLE WE LEARN FROM VOLTAIRE WHO HAD IT FROM NEWTON'S FAVOURITE NIECE WHO WITH HER HUSBAND LIVED AND KEPT HOUSE FOR HIM ALL HIS LATER LIFE
4629-19366-0004 IT IS VERY LIKE ONE OF THOSE ANECDOTES WHICH ARE EASILY INVENTED AND BELIEVED IN AND VERY OFTEN TURN OUT ON SCRUTINY TO HAVE NO FOUNDATION FORTUNATELY THIS ANECDOTE IS WELL AUTHENTICATED AND MOREOVER IS INTRINSICALLY PROBABLE
4629-19366-0005 I SAY FORTUNATELY BECAUSE IT IS ALWAYS PAINFUL TO HAVE TO GIVE UP THESE CHILD LEARNT ANECDOTES LIKE ALFRED AND THE CAKES AND SO ON THIS ANECDOTE OF THE APPLE WE NEED NOT RESIGN THE TREE WAS BLOWN DOWN IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY
4629-19366-0006 AND PART OF ITS WOOD IS PRESERVED I HAVE MENTIONED VOLTAIRE IN CONNECTION WITH NEWTON'S PHILOSOPHY THIS ACUTE CRITIC AT A LATER STAGE DID A GOOD DEAL TO POPULARISE IT THROUGHOUT EUROPE AND TO OVERTURN THAT OF HIS OWN COUNTRYMAN DESCARTES
4629-19366-0007 CAMBRIDGE RAPIDLY BECAME NEWTONIAN BUT OXFORD REMAINED CARTESIAN FOR FIFTY YEARS OR MORE IT IS CURIOUS WHAT LITTLE HOLD SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS HAVE EVER SECURED IN THE OLDER AND MORE ECCLESIASTICAL UNIVERSITY
4629-19366-0008 THE PRIDE OF POSSESSING NEWTON HAS HOWEVER NO DOUBT BEEN THE MAIN STIMULUS TO THE SPECIAL PURSUITS OF CAMBRIDGE HE NOW BEGAN TO TURN HIS ATTENTION TO OPTICS AND AS WAS USUAL WITH HIM HIS WHOLE MIND BECAME ABSORBED IN THIS SUBJECT
4629-19366-0009 AS IF NOTHING ELSE HAD EVER OCCUPIED HIM
4629-19366-0010 AND THE ENTRIES SHOW THAT HE IS BUYING PRISMS AND LENSES AND POLISHING POWDER AT THE BEGINNING OF SIXTEEN SIXTY SEVEN HE WAS ANXIOUS TO IMPROVE TELESCOPES BY MAKING MORE PERFECT LENSES THAN HAD EVER BEEN USED BEFORE
4629-19366-0011 WHICH WAS AT FAULT PERHAPS LIGHT WAS SO COMPOSED THAT IT COULD NOT BE FOCUSED ACCURATELY TO A SHARP AND DEFINITE POINT PERHAPS THE LAW OF REFRACTION WAS NOT QUITE ACCURATE BUT ONLY AN APPROXIMATION SO HE BOUGHT A PRISM TO TRY THE LAW
4629-19366-0012 IN A WINDOW SHUTTER INSERTED THE PRISM IN THE LIGHT AND RECEIVED THE DEFLECTED BEAM ON A WHITE SCREEN TURNING THE PRISM ABOUT TILL IT WAS DEVIATED AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE THE PATCH ON THE SCREEN WAS NOT A ROUND DISK
4629-19366-0013 WAS ABLE TO NEUTRALISE THE DISPERSION AND TO REPRODUCE THE SIMPLE ROUND WHITE SPOT WITHOUT DEVIATION EVIDENTLY THE SPREADING OUT OF THE BEAM WAS CONNECTED IN SOME DEFINITE WAY WITH ITS REFRACTION
4629-19366-0014 COULD IT BE THAT THE LIGHT PARTICLES AFTER PASSING THROUGH THE PRISM TRAVELLED IN VARIOUSLY CURVED LINES AS SPINNING RACQUET BALLS DO TO EXAMINE THIS HE MEASURED THE LENGTH OF THE OVAL PATCH WHEN THE SCREEN WAS AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES FROM THE PRISM
4629-19366-0015 AND FOUND THAT THE TWO THINGS WERE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO EACH OTHER DOUBLING THE DISTANCE OF THE SCREEN DOUBLED THE LENGTH OF THE PATCH HENCE THE RAYS TRAVELLED IN STRAIGHT LINES FROM THE PRISM AND THE SPREADING OUT WAS DUE TO SOMETHING THAT OCCURRED WITHIN ITS SUBSTANCE
4629-19366-0016 COULD IT BE THAT WHITE LIGHT WAS COMPOUND WAS A MIXTURE OF SEVERAL CONSTITUENTS AND THAT ITS DIFFERENT CONSTITUENTS WERE DIFFERENTLY BENT NO SOONER THOUGHT THAN TRIED PIERCE THE SCREEN TO LET ONE OF THE CONSTITUENTS THROUGH
4629-19366-0017 AND INTERPOSE A SECOND PRISM IN ITS PATH IF THE SPREADING OUT DEPENDED ON THE PRISM ONLY IT SHOULD SPREAD OUT JUST AS MUCH AS BEFORE
4629-19366-0018 THIS ISOLATED SIMPLE CONSTITUENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPREAD OUT NO MORE IT DID NOT SPREAD OUT ANY MORE A PRISM HAD NO MORE DISPERSIVE POWER OVER IT IT WAS DEFLECTED BY THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT BUT IT WAS NOT ANALYSED INTO CONSTITUENTS
4629-19366-0019 IT DIFFERED FROM SUNLIGHT IN BEING SIMPLE WITH MANY INGENIOUS AND BEAUTIFULLY SIMPLE EXPERIMENTS WHICH ARE QUOTED IN FULL IN SEVERAL BOOKS ON OPTICS HE CLINCHED THE ARGUMENT AND ESTABLISHED HIS DISCOVERY WHITE LIGHT WAS NOT SIMPLE BUT COMPOUND
4629-19366-0020 IT COULD BE SORTED OUT BY A PRISM INTO AN INFINITE NUMBER OF CONSTITUENT PARTS
4629-19366-0021 BUT IT IS TRANSPARENT TO THAT PARTICULAR PORTION WHICH AFFECTS OUR EYES WITH THE SENSATION OF RED
4629-19366-0022 SORTING OUT THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LIGHT COLOURED MEDIA ACT LIKE FILTERS STOPPING CERTAIN KINDS BUT ALLOWING THE REST TO GO THROUGH
4629-19366-0023 THIS SERIES OF IMAGES WE CALL A SPECTRUM AND THE OPERATION WE NOW CALL SPECTRUM ANALYSIS THE REASON OF THE DEFECT OF LENSES WAS NOW PLAIN IT WAS NOT SO MUCH A DEFECT OF THE LENS AS A DEFECT OF LIGHT
4629-19366-0024 BUT EACH HAVING A DIFFERENT VERTEX THE VIOLET CONE IS INNERMOST NEAR THE LENS THE RED CONE OUTERMOST
4629-19366-0025 BEYOND THE CROSSING POINT OR FOCUS THE ORDER OF CONES IS REVERSED AS THE ABOVE FIGURE SHOWS ONLY THE TWO MARGINAL RAYS OF THE BEAM ARE DEPICTED IF A SCREEN BE HELD ANYWHERE NEARER THE LENS THAN THE PLACE MARKED ONE
4629-19366-0026 THERE WILL BE A WHITISH CENTRE TO THE PATCH OF LIGHT AND A RED AND ORANGE FRINGE OR BORDER HELD ANYWHERE BEYOND THE REGION TWO THE BORDER OF THE PATCH WILL BE BLUE AND VIOLET HELD ABOUT THREE
4629-19366-0027 BUT NOWHERE CAN IT BE GOT RID OF EACH POINT OF AN OBJECT WILL BE REPRESENTED IN THE IMAGE NOT BY A POINT BUT BY A COLOURED PATCH A FACT WHICH AMPLY EXPLAINS THE OBSERVED BLURRING AND INDISTINCTNESS
4629-19366-0028 AND SHOWED THAT IT WAS ONE FIFTIETH THE DIAMETER OF THE LENS TO OVERCOME THIS DIFFICULTY CALLED CHROMATIC ABERRATION TELESCOPE GLASSES WERE MADE SMALL AND OF VERY LONG FOCUS
4629-19366-0029 SOME OF THEM SO LONG THAT THEY HAD NO TUBE ALL OF THEM EGREGIOUSLY CUMBROUS YET IT WAS WITH SUCH INSTRUMENTS THAT ALL THE EARLY DISCOVERIES WERE MADE
4629-19366-0030 THE DEFECTS OF REFRACTORS SEEMED IRREMEDIABLE BEING FOUNDED IN THE NATURE OF LIGHT ITSELF SO HE GAVE UP HIS GLASS WORKS AND PROCEEDED TO THINK OF REFLEXION FROM METAL SPECULA A CONCAVE MIRROR FORMS AN IMAGE JUST AS A LENS DOES
4629-19366-0031 AND MAGNIFIED FORTY TIMES
4629-19366-0032 AND SHOWED JUPITER'S MOONS SO HE MADE A LARGER ONE NOW IN THE LIBRARY OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY LONDON WITH AN INSCRIPTION THE FIRST REFLECTING TELESCOPE INVENTED BY SIR ISAAC NEWTON AND MADE WITH HIS OWN HANDS
4629-19366-0033 THIS HAS BEEN THE PARENT OF MOST OF THE GIGANTIC TELESCOPES OF THE PRESENT DAY
4629-19366-0034 FIRST BY HADLEY AND AFTERWARDS BY HERSCHEL AND OTHERS LARGE AND GOOD REFLECTORS WERE CONSTRUCTED THE LARGEST TELESCOPE EVER MADE THAT OF LORD ROSSE IS A NEWTONIAN REFLECTOR FIFTY FEET LONG SIX FEET DIAMETER
4629-19366-0035 WITH A MIRROR WEIGHING FOUR TONS THE SEXTANT AS USED BY NAVIGATORS
4629-19366-0036 STILL HOWEVER HIS METHOD OF FLUXIONS WAS UNKNOWN AND STILL HE DID NOT PUBLISH IT HE LECTURED FIRST ON OPTICS GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF HIS EXPERIMENTS HIS LECTURES WERE AFTERWARDS PUBLISHED BOTH IN LATIN AND ENGLISH AND ARE HIGHLY VALUED TO THIS DAY
4629-19366-0037 THE FAME OF HIS MATHEMATICAL GENIUS CAME TO THE EARS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND A MOTION WAS MADE TO GET HIM ELECTED A FELLOW OF THAT BODY THE ROYAL SOCIETY THE OLDEST AND MOST FAMOUS OF ALL SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES WITH A CONTINUOUS EXISTENCE
4629-19366-0038 AMONG THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS BEING BOYLE HOOKE CHRISTOPHER WREN AND OTHER LESS FAMOUS NAMES BOYLE WAS A GREAT EXPERIMENTER A WORTHY FOLLOWER OF DOCTOR GILBERT HOOKE BEGAN AS HIS ASSISTANT BUT BEING OF A MOST EXTRAORDINARY INGENUITY
4629-19366-0039 WITH GREAT INGENUITY REMARKABLE SCIENTIFIC INSIGHT AND CONSUMMATE EXPERIMENTAL SKILL HE STANDS IN MANY RESPECTS ALMOST ON A LEVEL WITH GALILEO BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE STARS EVEN OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE WHEN THE SUN IS UP
4629-19366-0040 AND THUS IT HAPPENS THAT THE NAME AND FAME OF THIS BRILLIANT MAN ARE ALMOST LOST IN THE BLAZE OF NEWTON OF CHRISTOPHER WREN I NEED NOT SAY MUCH HE IS WELL KNOWN AS AN ARCHITECT BUT HE WAS A MOST ACCOMPLISHED ALL ROUND MAN
4629-19366-0041 AND HAD A CONSIDERABLE TASTE AND FACULTY FOR SCIENCE THESE THEN WERE THE LUMINARIES OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY AT THE TIME WE ARE SPEAKING OF AND TO THEM NEWTON'S FIRST SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATION WAS SUBMITTED HE COMMUNICATED TO THEM AN ACCOUNT OF HIS REFLECTING TELESCOPE
4629-19366-0042 AND PRESENTED THEM WITH THE INSTRUMENT THEIR RECEPTION OF IT SURPRISED HIM THEY WERE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH IT AND WROTE SPECIALLY THANKING HIM FOR THE COMMUNICATION AND ASSURING HIM THAT ALL RIGHT SHOULD BE DONE HIM IN THE MATTER OF THE INVENTION THE BISHOP OF SALISBURY BISHOP BURNET
4629-19366-0043 IN REPLY HE EXPRESSED HIS SURPRISE AT THE VALUE THEY SET ON THE TELESCOPE AND OFFERED IF THEY CARED FOR IT
4629-19366-0044 THAN THE COMMUNICATION OF THAT INSTRUMENT
4629-19366-0045 A SERIES OF PAPERS WHICH WERE LONG AFTERWARDS INCORPORATED AND PUBLISHED AS HIS OPTICS A MAGNIFICENT WORK WHICH OF ITSELF SUFFICES TO PLACE ITS AUTHOR IN THE FIRST RANK OF THE WORLD'S MEN OF SCIENCE
4629-19366-0046 AND THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS BESIDES A GOOD NUMBER OF MINOR RESULTS BINOMIAL THEOREM REFLECTING TELESCOPE SEXTANT AND THE LIKE ONE WOULD THINK IT ENOUGH FOR ONE MAN'S LIFE WORK
4629-19366-0047 IT IS AS WHEN ONE IS CONSIDERING SHAKSPEARE KING LEAR MACBETH OTHELLO SURELY A SUFFICIENT ACHIEVEMENT BUT THE MASTERPIECE REMAINS COMPARISONS IN DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS ARE BUT LITTLE HELP PERHAPS
4629-19366-0048 NEVERTHELESS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN HIS OWN DEPARTMENT AND CONSIDERED SIMPLY AS A MAN OF SCIENCE NEWTON TOWERS HEAD AND SHOULDERS OVER NOT ONLY HIS CONTEMPORARIES THAT IS A SMALL MATTER BUT OVER EVERY OTHER SCIENTIFIC MAN
4629-19366-0049 WHO HAS EVER LIVED IN A WAY THAT WE CAN FIND NO PARALLEL FOR IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS OTHER NATIONS ADMIT HIS SCIENTIFIC PRE EMINENCE WITH AS MUCH ALACRITY AS WE DO
4629-19366-0050 DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF HIS MEMBERSHIP THERE
4629-19366-0051 OF A VERY CAREFUL DETERMINATION OF THE LENGTH OF A DEGREE
4629-19366-0052 WHICH HAD BEEN MADE BY PICARD NEAR PARIS THE LENGTH OF THE DEGREE TURNED OUT TO BE NOT SIXTY MILES BUT NEARLY SEVENTY MILES HOW SOON NEWTON HEARD OF THIS WE DO NOT LEARN PROBABLY NOT FOR SOME YEARS
4629-19366-0053 WHAT IF IT SHOULD TURN OUT TO BE TRUE AFTER ALL HE TOOK OUT HIS OLD PAPERS AND BEGAN AGAIN THE CALCULATION IF GRAVITY WERE THE FORCE KEEPING THE MOON IN ITS ORBIT IT WOULD FALL TOWARD THE EARTH SIXTEEN FEET EVERY MINUTE
4629-19366-0054 THE NEWLY KNOWN SIZE OF THE EARTH WOULD MODIFY THE FIGURES WITH INTENSE EXCITEMENT HE RUNS THROUGH THE WORKING HIS MIND LEAPS BEFORE HIS HAND AND AS HE PERCEIVES THE ANSWER TO BE COMING OUT RIGHT ALL THE INFINITE MEANING AND SCOPE OF HIS MIGHTY DISCOVERY FLASHES UPON HIM
4629-19366-0055 AND DEEPER AND DEEPER CONSEQUENCES REVEALED THEMSELVES TO HIM AS HE PROCEEDED FOR TWO YEARS HE DEVOTED HIMSELF SOLELY TO THIS ONE OBJECT DURING THOSE YEARS HE LIVED BUT TO CALCULATE AND THINK AND THE MOST LUDICROUS STORIES ARE TOLD CONCERNING HIS ENTIRE ABSORPTION
4629-19366-0056 AND INATTENTION TO ORDINARY AFFAIRS OF LIFE THUS FOR INSTANCE WHEN GETTING UP IN A MORNING HE WOULD SIT ON THE SIDE OF THE BED HALF DRESSED AND REMAIN LIKE THAT TILL DINNER TIME OFTEN HE WOULD STAY AT HOME FOR DAYS TOGETHER EATING WHAT WAS TAKEN TO HIM
4629-19366-0057 BUT WITHOUT APPARENTLY NOTICING WHAT HE WAS DOING ONE DAY AN INTIMATE FRIEND DOCTOR STUKELY CALLED ON HIM AND FOUND ON THE TABLE A COVER LAID FOR HIS SOLITARY DINNER
4629-19366-0058 REPLACING AND COVERING UP THE BONES AGAIN
4629-19366-0059 DEAR ME I THOUGHT I HAD NOT DINED BUT I SEE I HAVE IT WAS BY THIS CONTINUOUS APPLICATION THAT THE PRINCIPIA WAS ACCOMPLISHED PROBABLY NOTHING OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT SOMETHING OF THE SAME ABSORBED UNCONSCIOUSNESS AND FREEDOM FROM INTERRUPTION
4629-19366-0060 BUT THOUGH DESIRABLE AND ESSENTIAL FOR THE WORK IT WAS A SEVERE TAX UPON THE POWERS OF THE MAN THERE IS IN FACT NO DOUBT THAT NEWTON'S BRAIN SUFFERED TEMPORARY ABERRATION AFTER THIS EFFORT FOR A SHORT TIME THE ATTACK WAS SLIGHT AND IT HAS BEEN DENIED
4629-19366-0061 BUT THERE ARE LETTERS EXTANT WHICH ARE INEXPLICABLE OTHERWISE AND MOREOVER AFTER A YEAR OR TWO HE WRITES TO HIS FRIENDS APOLOGIZING FOR STRANGE AND DISJOINTED EPISTLES
4629-19366-0062 THE DERANGEMENT WAS HOWEVER BOTH SLIGHT AND TEMPORARY
4629-19366-0063 THE FIRST PART OF THE WORK HAVING BEEN DONE
4629-19366-0064 BUT THE FACT IS THAT AFTER HE HAD SENT TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY HIS PAPERS ON OPTICS
4629-19366-0065 TO WHICH HE FELT COMPELLED TO FIND ANSWERS MANY MEN WOULD HAVE ENJOYED THIS PART OF THE WORK AND TAKEN IT AS EVIDENCE OF INTEREST AND SUCCESS BUT TO NEWTON'S SHY AND RETIRING DISPOSITION THESE DISCUSSIONS WERE MERELY PAINFUL HE WRITES INDEED HIS ANSWERS WITH GREAT PATIENCE AND ABILITY
4629-19366-0066 AND ULTIMATELY CONVERTS THE MORE REASONABLE OF HIS OPPONENTS BUT HE RELIEVES HIS MIND IN THE FOLLOWING LETTER TO THE SECRETARY OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY
4629-19366-0067 I SEE I HAVE MADE MYSELF A SLAVE TO PHILOSOPHY
4629-19366-0068 OR LEAVE TO COME OUT AFTER ME FOR I SEE A MAN MUST EITHER RESOLVE TO PUT OUT NOTHING NEW
4629-19366-0069 I HAVE BEEN SO PERSECUTED WITH DISCUSSIONS ARISING OUT OF MY THEORY OF LIGHT THAT I BLAMED MY OWN IMPRUDENCE FOR PARTING WITH SO SUBSTANTIAL A BLESSING AS MY QUIET TO RUN AFTER A SHADOW
4629-19366-0070 THIS SHOWS HOW MUCH HE CARED FOR CONTEMPORARY FAME SO HE LOCKED UP THE FIRST PART OF THE PRINCIPIA IN HIS DESK DOUBTLESS INTENDING IT TO BE PUBLISHED AFTER HIS DEATH
4629-19366-0071 IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY THREE AMONG THE LEADING LIGHTS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY
4629-19366-0072 THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION SEEMED TO BE IN THE AIR AND WREN HOOKE AND HALLEY HAD MANY A TALK ABOUT IT HOOKE SHOWED AN EXPERIMENT WITH A PENDULUM WHICH HE LIKENED TO A PLANET GOING ROUND THE SUN
4629-19366-0073 THE ANALOGY IS MORE SUPERFICIAL THAN REAL IT DOES NOT OBEY KEPLER'S LAWS STILL IT WAS A STRIKING EXPERIMENT THEY HAD GUESSED AT A LAW OF INVERSE SQUARES AND THEIR DIFFICULTY WAS TO PROVE WHAT CURVE A BODY SUBJECT TO IT WOULD DESCRIBE
4629-19366-0074 THEY KNEW IT OUGHT TO BE AN ELLIPSE IF IT WAS TO SERVE TO EXPLAIN THE PLANETARY MOTION AND HOOKE SAID HE COULD PROVE THAT AN ELLIPSE IT WAS BUT HE WAS NOTHING OF A MATHEMATICIAN AND THE OTHERS SCARCELY BELIEVED HIM UNDOUBTEDLY
4629-19366-0075 HE HAD SHREWD INKLINGS OF THE TRUTH THOUGH HIS GUESSES WERE BASED ON LITTLE ELSE THAN A MOST SAGACIOUS INTUITION HE SURMISED ALSO THAT GRAVITY WAS THE FORCE CONCERNED AND ASSERTED THAT THE PATH OF AN ORDINARY PROJECTILE WAS AN ELLIPSE LIKE THE PATH OF A PLANET WHICH IS QUITE RIGHT
4629-19366-0076 IN FACT THE BEGINNINGS OF THE DISCOVERY WERE BEGINNING TO DAWN UPON HIM IN THE WELL KNOWN WAY IN WHICH THINGS DO DAWN UPON ORDINARY MEN OF GENIUS AND HAD NEWTON NOT LIVED WE SHOULD DOUBTLESS BY THE LABOURS OF A LONG CHAIN OF DISTINGUISHED MEN
4629-19366-0077 BEGINNING WITH HOOKE WREN AND HALLEY HAVE BEEN NOW IN POSSESSION OF ALL THE TRUTHS REVEALED BY THE PRINCIPIA WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAD THEM STATED IN THE SAME FORM NOR PROVED WITH THE SAME MARVELLOUS LUCIDITY AND SIMPLICITY
4629-19366-0078 BUT THE FACTS THEMSELVES WE SHOULD BY THIS TIME HAVE ARRIVED AT THEIR DEVELOPMENTS AND COMPLETIONS DUE TO SUCH MEN AS CLAIRAUT EULER D'ALEMBERT LAGRANGE LAPLACE AIRY LEVERRIER ADAMS
4629-19366-0079 WE SHOULD OF COURSE NOT HAVE HAD TO THE SAME EXTENT BECAUSE THE LIVES AND ENERGIES OF THESE GREAT MEN WOULD HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY CONSUMED IN OBTAINING THE MAIN FACTS THEMSELVES THE YOUNGEST OF THE THREE QUESTIONERS AT THE TIME WE ARE SPEAKING OF WAS EDMUND HALLEY
4629-19366-0080 HE HAD BEEN AT CAMBRIDGE DOUBTLESS HAD HEARD NEWTON LECTURE AND HAD ACQUIRED A GREAT VENERATION FOR HIM IN JANUARY SIXTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WE FIND WREN OFFERING HOOKE AND HALLEY A PRIZE IN THE SHAPE OF A BOOK WORTH FORTY SHILLINGS
4629-19366-0081 HOW ON EARTH DO YOU KNOW SAID HALLEY IN AMAZEMENT WHY I HAVE CALCULATED IT AND BEGAN HUNTING ABOUT FOR THE PAPER HE ACTUALLY COULDN'T FIND IT JUST THEN BUT SENT IT HIM SHORTLY BY POST AND WITH IT MUCH MORE IN FACT WHAT APPEARED TO BE A COMPLETE TREATISE ON MOTION IN GENERAL
4629-19366-0082 WITH HIS VALUABLE BURDEN HALLEY HASTENED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND TOLD THEM WHAT HE HAD DISCOVERED THE SOCIETY AT HIS REPRESENTATION WROTE TO MISTER NEWTON ASKING LEAVE THAT IT MIGHT BE PRINTED TO THIS HE CONSENTED
4629-19366-0083 MISTER HALLEY TO SEE AFTER HIM AND JOG HIS MEMORY IN CASE HE FORGOT ABOUT IT HOWEVER HE SET TO WORK TO POLISH IT UP AND FINISH IT AND ADDED TO IT A GREAT NUMBER OF LATER DEVELOPMENTS AND EMBELLISHMENTS ESPECIALLY THE PART CONCERNING THE LUNAR THEORY
4629-19366-0084 WHICH GAVE HIM A DEAL OF TROUBLE AND NO WONDER FOR IN THE WAY HE HAS PUT IT THERE NEVER WAS A MAN YET LIVING WHO COULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING
4629-19366-0085 OF A BYGONE AGE WONDERING WHAT MANNER OF MAN THIS WAS ABLE TO WIELD SUCH PONDEROUS IMPLEMENTS WITH SUCH APPARENT EASE TO HALLEY THE WORLD OWES A GREAT DEBT OF GRATITUDE FIRST FOR DISCOVERING THE PRINCIPIA SECOND FOR SEEING IT THROUGH THE PRESS
4629-19366-0086 AND THIRD FOR DEFRAYING THE COST OF ITS PUBLICATION OUT OF HIS OWN SCANTY PURSE FOR THOUGH HE ULTIMATELY SUFFERED NO PECUNIARY LOSS RATHER THE CONTRARY YET THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE RISK IN BRINGING OUT A BOOK
4629-19366-0087 WHICH NOT A DOZEN MEN LIVING COULD AT THE TIME COMPREHEND IT IS NO SMALL PART OF THE MERIT OF HALLEY THAT HE RECOGNIZED THE TRANSCENDENT VALUE OF THE YET UNFINISHED WORK THAT HE BROUGHT IT TO LIGHT AND ASSISTED IN ITS BECOMING UNDERSTOOD TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY
4629-19366-0088 THOUGH HALLEY AFTERWARDS BECAME ASTRONOMER ROYAL LIVED TO THE RIPE OLD AGE OF EIGHTY SIX AND MADE MANY STRIKING OBSERVATIONS YET
4629-19366-0089 AND HE ALWAYS USED TO REGARD HIS PART IN IT WITH PECULIAR PRIDE AND PLEASURE AND HOW WAS THE PRINCIPIA RECEIVED CONSIDERING THE ABSTRUSE NATURE OF ITS SUBJECT IT WAS RECEIVED WITH GREAT INTEREST AND ENTHUSIASM
4629-19366-0090 IN LESS THAN TWENTY YEARS THE EDITION WAS SOLD OUT AND COPIES FETCHED LARGE SUMS WE HEAR OF POOR STUDENTS COPYING OUT THE WHOLE IN MANUSCRIPT IN ORDER TO POSSESS A COPY NOT BY ANY MEANS A BAD THING TO DO HOWEVER MANY COPIES ONE MAY POSSESS
4629-19366-0091 THE ONLY USEFUL WAY REALLY TO READ A BOOK LIKE THAT IS TO PORE OVER EVERY SENTENCE IT IS NO BOOK TO BE SKIMMED WHILE THE PRINCIPIA WAS PREPARING FOR THE PRESS A CURIOUS INCIDENT OF CONTACT BETWEEN ENGLISH HISTORY AND THE UNIVERSITY OCCURRED
4629-19366-0092 ORDERED BOTH UNIVERSITIES TO ELECT CERTAIN PRIESTS TO DEGREES WITHOUT THE ORDINARY OATHS OXFORD HAD GIVEN WAY AND THE DEAN OF CHRIST CHURCH WAS A CREATURE OF JAMES'S CHOOSING
4629-19366-0093 CAMBRIDGE REBELLED AND SENT EIGHT OF ITS MEMBERS AMONG THEM MISTER NEWTON TO PLEAD THEIR CAUSE BEFORE THE COURT OF HIGH COMMISSION JUDGE JEFFREYS PRESIDED OVER THE COURT AND THREATENED AND BULLIED WITH HIS USUAL INSOLENCE
4629-19366-0094 THE VICE CHANCELLOR OF CAMBRIDGE WAS DEPRIVED OF OFFICE THE OTHER DEPUTIES WERE SILENCED AND ORDERED AWAY FROM THE PRECINCTS OF THIS COURT OF JUSTICE NEWTON RETURNED TO TRINITY COLLEGE TO COMPLETE THE PRINCIPIA
4629-19366-0095 BY THIS TIME NEWTON WAS ONLY FORTY FIVE YEARS OLD BUT HIS MAIN WORK WAS DONE HIS METHOD OF FLUXIONS WAS STILL UNPUBLISHED HIS OPTICS WAS PUBLISHED ONLY IMPERFECTLY A SECOND EDITION OF
4629-19366-0096 THE PRINCIPIA WITH ADDITIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS HAD YET TO APPEAR BUT FAME HAD NOW COME UPON HIM AND WITH FAME WORRIES OF ALL KINDS BY SOME FATALITY PRINCIPALLY NO DOUBT BECAUSE OF THE INTEREST THEY EXCITED
4629-19366-0097 OF A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN HE COULD REALLY STATE OR PROVE BY INDISCREET FRIENDS THESE TWO GREAT MEN WERE SET SOMEWHAT AT LOGGERHEADS AND WORSE MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED HAD THEY NOT MANAGED TO COME TO CLOSE QUARTERS AND CORRESPOND PRIVATELY IN A QUITE FRIENDLY MANNER
4629-19366-0098 INSTEAD OF ACTING THROUGH THE MISCHIEVOUS MEDIUM OF THIRD PARTIES IN THE NEXT EDITION NEWTON LIBERALLY RECOGNIZES THE CLAIMS OF BOTH HOOKE AND WREN HOWEVER HE TAKES WARNING BETIMES OF WHAT HE HAS TO EXPECT AND WRITES TO HALLEY THAT HE WILL ONLY PUBLISH THE FIRST TWO BOOKS
4629-19366-0099 THOSE CONTAINING GENERAL THEOREMS ON MOTION THE THIRD BOOK CONCERNING THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD
4629-19366-0100 I NOW DESIGN TO SUPPRESS PHILOSOPHY IS SUCH AN IMPERTINENTLY LITIGIOUS LADY THAT A MAN HAD AS GOOD BE ENGAGED IN LAW SUITS AS HAVE TO DO WITH HER I FOUND IT SO FORMERLY AND NOW I AM NO SOONER COME NEAR HER AGAIN BUT SHE GIVES ME WARNING
4629-19366-0101 MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEREFORE I HAD ALTERED IT TO THIS ON THE FREE MOTION OF TWO BODIES BUT ON SECOND THOUGHTS I RETAIN THE FORMER TITLE
4629-19366-0102 WHICH I OUGHT NOT TO DIMINISH NOW TIS YOURS
4629-19366-0103 WHO HAD ALSO INDEPENDENTLY INVENTED THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS IT WAS NOT SO WELL RECOGNIZED THEN HOW FREQUENTLY IT HAPPENS THAT TWO MEN INDEPENDENTLY AND UNKNOWINGLY WORK AT THE VERY SAME THING AT THE SAME TIME
4629-19366-0104 LONG AFTER BOTH THEIR DEATHS IT CAN HARDLY BE CALLED ANCIENT HISTORY EVEN NOW BUT FAME BROUGHT OTHER AND LESS UNPLEASANT DISTRACTIONS THAN CONTROVERSIES WE ARE A CURIOUS PRACTICAL AND RATHER STUPID PEOPLE AND OUR ONE IDEA OF HONOURING A MAN
4629-19366-0105 IS TO VOTE FOR HIM IN SOME WAY OR OTHER SO THEY SENT NEWTON TO PARLIAMENT HE WENT I BELIEVE AS A WHIG BUT IT IS NOT RECORDED THAT HE SPOKE IT IS IN FACT RECORDED THAT HE WAS ONCE EXPECTED TO SPEAK WHEN ON A ROYAL COMMISSION ABOUT SOME QUESTION OF CHRONOMETERS
4629-19366-0106 BUT THAT HE WOULD NOT HOWEVER I DARE SAY HE MADE A GOOD AVERAGE MEMBER THEN A LITTLE LATER IT WAS REALIZED THAT NEWTON WAS POOR THAT HE STILL HAD TO TEACH FOR HIS LIVELIHOOD
4629-19366-0107 WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF TAKING ORDERS YET IT WAS RATHER DISGRACEFUL THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE BETTER OFF SO AN APPEAL WAS MADE TO THE GOVERNMENT ON HIS BEHALF AND LORD HALIFAX WHO EXERTED HIMSELF STRONGLY IN THE MATTER SUCCEEDING TO OFFICE ON THE ACCESSION OF WILLIAM THE THIRD
4629-19366-0108 I BELIEVE HE MADE RATHER A GOOD MASTER AND TURNED OUT EXCELLENT COINS CERTAINLY HE DEVOTED HIS ATTENTION TO HIS WORK THERE IN A MOST EXEMPLARY MANNER BUT WHAT A PITIFUL BUSINESS IT ALL IS HERE IS A MAN SENT BY HEAVEN
4629-19366-0109 TO DO CERTAIN THINGS WHICH NO MAN ELSE COULD DO AND SO LONG AS HE IS COMPARATIVELY UNKNOWN HE DOES THEM BUT SO SOON AS HE IS FOUND OUT HE IS CLAPPED INTO A ROUTINE OFFICE WITH A BIG SALARY AND THERE IS COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING AN END OF HIM
4629-19366-0110 IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT HE HAD LOST HIS POWER FOR HE FREQUENTLY SOLVED PROBLEMS VERY QUICKLY WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN OUT BY GREAT CONTINENTAL MATHEMATICIANS AS A CHALLENGE TO THE WORLD WE MAY ASK WHY NEWTON ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE THUS BANDIED ABOUT
4629-19366-0111 INSTEAD OF SETTLING HIMSELF DOWN TO THE WORK IN WHICH HE WAS SO PRE EMINENTLY GREAT WELL I EXPECT YOUR TRULY GREAT MAN NEVER REALIZES HOW GREAT HE IS AND SELDOM KNOWS WHERE HIS REAL STRENGTH LIES CERTAINLY NEWTON DID NOT KNOW IT
4629-19366-0112 HE SEVERAL TIMES TALKS OF GIVING UP PHILOSOPHY ALTOGETHER AND THOUGH HE NEVER REALLY DOES IT AND PERHAPS THE FEELING IS ONE ONLY BORN OF SOME TEMPORARY OVERWORK YET HE DOES NOT SACRIFICE EVERYTHING ELSE TO IT
4629-19366-0113 AS HE SURELY MUST HAD HE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF HIS OWN GREATNESS NO SELF CONSCIOUSNESS WAS THE LAST THING THAT AFFECTED HIM IT IS FOR A GREAT MAN'S CONTEMPORARIES TO DISCOVER HIM TO MAKE MUCH OF HIM AND TO PUT HIM IN SURROUNDINGS WHERE HE MAY FLOURISH LUXURIANTLY
4629-19366-0114 IN HIS OWN HEAVEN INTENDED WAY HOWEVER IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO JUDGE OF THESE THINGS PERHAPS IF HE HAD BEEN MAINTAINED AT THE NATIONAL EXPENSE TO DO THAT FOR WHICH HE WAS PRETERNATURALLY FITTED HE MIGHT HAVE WORN HIMSELF OUT PREMATURELY
4629-19366-0115 WHEREAS BY GIVING HIM ROUTINE WORK THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD GOT THE BENEFIT OF HIS MATURED WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE IT WAS NO SMALL MATTER TO THE YOUNG ROYAL SOCIETY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE HIM AS THEIR PRESIDENT FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS HIS PORTRAIT
4629-19366-0116 HAS HUNG OVER THE PRESIDENT'S CHAIR EVER SINCE AND THERE I SUPPOSE IT WILL CONTINUE TO HANG UNTIL THE ROYAL SOCIETY BECOMES EXTINCT THE EVENTS OF HIS LATER LIFE I SHALL PASS OVER LIGHTLY HE LIVED A CALM BENEVOLENT LIFE UNIVERSALLY RESPECTED AND BELOVED
4629-19366-0117 HIS SILVER WHITE HAIR WHEN HE REMOVED HIS PERUKE WAS A VENERABLE SPECTACLE A LOCK OF IT IS STILL PRESERVED WITH MANY OTHER RELICS IN THE LIBRARY OF TRINITY COLLEGE
4629-19366-0118 AT THE RIPE AGE OF EIGHTY FIVE HIS BODY LAY IN STATE IN THE JERUSALEM CHAMBER AND HE WAS BURIED IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY SIX PEERS BEARING THE PALL
4629-19366-0119 THE IDEA PERHAPS DID NOT NATURALLY OCCUR TO HIM ANY MORE THAN THE IDEA OF PUBLISHING HIS WORK DID HE WAS ALWAYS A DEEPLY RELIGIOUS MAN AND A SINCERE CHRISTIAN THOUGH SOMEWHAT OF THE ARIAN OR UNITARIAN PERSUASION SO AT LEAST IT IS ASSERTED BY ORTHODOX DIVINES WHO UNDERSTAND THESE MATTERS
4629-19366-0120 WAS GREATLY INTERESTED IN QUESTIONS OF BIBLICAL CRITICISM AND CHRONOLOGY BY SOME ANCIENT ECLIPSE OR OTHER HE ALTERED THE RECOGNIZED SYSTEM OF DATES A FEW HUNDRED YEARS AND HIS BOOK ON THE PROPHECIES OF DANIEL AND THE REVELATION OF SAINT JOHN WHEREIN HE IDENTIFIES THE BEAST WITH THE CHURCH OF ROME
4629-19366-0121 IN QUITE THE ORTHODOX WAY IS STILL BY SOME ADMIRED BUT IN ALL THESE MATTERS IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE WAS A MERELY ORDINARY MAN WITH NATURAL ACUMEN AND ABILITY DOUBTLESS BUT NOTHING IN THE LEAST SUPERHUMAN IN SCIENCE THE IMPRESSION HE MAKES UPON ME
4629-19366-0122 AND YET IF ONE REALIZES HIS METHOD OF WORK AND THE CALM UNINTERRUPTED FLOW OF ALL HIS EARLIER LIFE PERHAPS HIS ACHIEVEMENTS BECOME MORE INTELLIGIBLE WHEN ASKED HOW HE MADE HIS DISCOVERIES HE REPLIED
4629-19366-0123 I KEEP THE SUBJECT CONSTANTLY BEFORE ME
4629-19366-0124 THAT IS THE WAY QUIET STEADY CONTINUOUS THINKING UNINTERRUPTED AND UNHARASSED BROODING MUCH MAY BE DONE UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS MUCH OUGHT TO BE SACRIFICED TO OBTAIN THOSE CONDITIONS
4629-19366-0125 GENIUS IS PATIENCE SO SAYS NEWTON
4629-19366-0126 IF I HAVE DONE THE PUBLIC ANY SERVICE THIS WAY
4629-19366-0127 GENIUS PATIENCE NO IT IS NOT QUITE THAT OR RATHER IT IS MUCH MORE THAN THAT
