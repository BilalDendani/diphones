4108-12546-0000 MY BOOTS WERE SOMEWHAT THE WORSE FOR WEAR AND MY OLD FASHIONED CLOTHES UNDERSTOOD WELL ENOUGH BY PIONEERS ALONG THE TRAIL WERE DILAPIDATED I WAS NOT THE MOST PRESENTABLE SPECIMEN FOR EVERY SORT OF COMPANY
4108-12546-0001 ALREADY I HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO SAY THAT I WAS NOT A CORN DOCTOR OR ANY KIND OF DOCTOR THAT I DID NOT HAVE PATENT MEDICINE TO SELL AND THAT I WAS NOT SOLICITING CONTRIBUTIONS TO SUPPORT THE EXPEDITION
4108-12546-0002 BUT I THOUGHT IT WELL TO MAKE A CAMPAIGN OF EDUCATION TO GET THE WORK BEFORE THE GENERAL PUBLIC SO THAT CONGRESS MIGHT KNOW ABOUT IT THEREFORE A ROUTE WAS LAID OUT TO OCCUPY THE TIME UNTIL THE FIRST OF DECEMBER JUST BEFORE CONGRESS WOULD AGAIN ASSEMBLE
4108-12546-0003 THE ROUTE LAY THROUGH INDIANAPOLIS DAYTON CLEVELAND COLUMBUS BUFFALO ALBANY NEW YORK TRENTON PHILADELPHIA AND BALTIMORE TO WASHINGTON
4108-12546-0004 FOR THE MOST PART I RECEIVED A WARM WELCOME ALL ALONG THE ROUTE DAYTON TREATED ME GENEROUSLY MAYOR BADGER OF COLUMBUS WROTE GIVING ME THE FREEDOM OF THE CITY AND MAYOR TOM JOHNSON WROTE TO HIS CHIEF OF POLICE TO
4108-12546-0005 TREAT MISTER MEEKER AS THE GUEST OF THE CITY OF CLEVELAND WHICH WAS DONE AT BUFFALO A BENEFIT PERFORMANCE FOR ONE OF THE HOSPITALS IN THE SHAPE OF A CIRCUS WAS IN PREPARATION
4108-12546-0006 A PART OF THE ELABORATE PROGRAM WAS AN ATTACK BY INDIANS ON AN EMIGRANT TRAIN THE INDIANS BEING REPRESENTATIVE YOUNG MEN OF THE CITY AT THIS JUNCTURE I ARRIVED IN THE CITY AND WAS BESOUGHT TO GO AND REPRESENT THE TRAIN
4108-12546-0007 FOR WHICH THEY WOULD PAY ME NO NOT FOR PAY I SAID BUT I WILL GO SO THERE WAS QUITE A REALISTIC SHOW IN THE RING THAT AFTERNOON AND EVENING AND THE HOSPITAL RECEIVED MORE THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS BENEFIT
4108-12546-0008 SO WHEN WE CAME TO THE FORKS OF THE ROAD I FOLLOWED THE BEST BEATEN TRACK AND WAS SOON TRAVELING ALONG ON THE LEVEL HARD BUT NARROW WAY THE TOWPATH ALL WENT WELL THAT DAY
4108-12546-0009 WE WERE NOT SO FORTUNATE THE NEXT DAY HOWEVER WHEN A BOAT WITH THREE MEN TWO WOMEN AND THREE LONG EARED MULES WAS SQUARELY MET THE MULES BEING ON THE TOWPATH THE MULES TOOK FRIGHT GOT INTO A REGULAR MIXUP
4108-12546-0010 BROKE THE HARNESS AND WENT UP THE TOWPATH AT A TWO FORTY GAIT AS I HAD WALKED INTO ONEIDA THE NIGHT BEFORE I DID NOT SEE THE SIGHT OR HEAR THE WAR OF WORDS THAT FOLLOWED THE MEN ORDERED MARDEN TO
4108-12546-0011 MEANWHILE SWEARING AT THE TOP OF THEIR VOICES WHILE THE WOMEN SCOLDED IN CHORUS ONE OF THEM FAIRLY SHRIEKING MY OLD MUZZLE LOADING RIFLE THAT WE HAD CARRIED ACROSS THE PLAINS LAY HANDY WHEN THE MEN STARTED TOWARD HIM
4108-12546-0012 MARDEN PICKED UP THE RIFLE TO SHOW FIGHT AND CALLED ON THE DOG JIM TO TAKE HOLD OF THE MEN AS HE RAISED THE GUN TO USE IT AS A CLUB ONE OF THE BOATMEN THREW UP HIS HANDS BAWLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE DON'T SHOOT DON'T SHOOT
4108-12546-0013 HE FORGOT TO MIX IN OATHS AND SLUNK OUT OF SIGHT BEHIND THE WAGON THE OTHERS ALSO DREW BACK JIM SHOWED HIS TEETH AND A TRUCE FOLLOWED WITH BUT LITTLE INCONVENIENCE THE MULES WERE TAKEN OFF THE PATH AND THE OX TEAM WAS DRIVEN PAST
4108-12546-0014 THE FUN OF IT WAS THAT THE GUN THAT HAD SPREAD SUCH CONSTERNATION HADN'T BEEN LOADED FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS
4108-12546-0015 AND I HAD JUST GONE AROUND THE CORNER TO ENGAGE QUARTERS FOR THE NIGHT WHEN THIS OCCURRED RETURNING I SAW THE YOUNG POLICEMAN ATTEMPT TO MOVE THE TEAM BUT AS HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW THEY WOULDN'T BUDGE A PEG WHEREUPON HE ARRESTED MY DRIVER AND TOOK HIM AWAY
4108-12546-0016 ANOTHER POLICEMAN TRIED TO COAX ME TO DRIVE THE TEAM DOWN TO THE POLICE STATION I SAID NO SIR I WILL NOT HE COULDN'T DRIVE THE TEAM TO THE STATION AND I WOULDN'T AND SO THERE WE WERE TO ARREST ME WOULD MAKE MATTERS WORSE
4108-12546-0017 CALLED HIS MAN OFF AND ORDERED MY DRIVER RELEASED IT APPEARED THAT THERE WAS AN ORDINANCE AGAINST ALLOWING CATTLE TO BE DRIVEN ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK OF COURSE THIS WAS INTENDED TO APPLY TO LOOSE CATTLE
4108-12546-0018 BUT THE POLICEMEN INTERPRETED IT TO MEAN ANY CATTLE AND THEY HAD THE CLUBS TO ENFORCE THEIR INTERPRETATION I WAS IN THE CITY AND COULDN'T GET OUT WITHOUT SUBJECTING MYSELF TO ARREST ACCORDING TO THEIR VIEW OF THE LAW
4108-12546-0019 AND IN FACT I DIDN'T WANT TO GET OUT I WANTED TO DRIVE DOWN BROADWAY FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER AND I DID A MONTH LATER ALL HANDS SAID NOTHING SHORT OF AN ORDINANCE BY THE BOARD OF ALDERMEN WOULD CLEAR THE WAY SO I TACKLED THE ALDERMEN
4108-12546-0020 THE NEW YORK HERALD DID THE SAME THING AND SO IT CAME ABOUT THAT THE ALDERMEN PASSED AN ORDINANCE GRANTING ME THE RIGHT OF WAY FOR THIRTY DAYS AND ALSO ENDORSED MY WORK I THOUGHT MY TROUBLE WAS OVER WHEN THAT ORDINANCE WAS PASSED NOT SO
4108-12546-0021 THE MAYOR WAS ABSENT AND THE ACTING MAYOR COULD NOT SIGN AN ORDINANCE UNTIL AFTER TEN DAYS HAD ELAPSED THE CITY ATTORNEY CAME IN AND SAID THE ALDERMEN HAD EXCEEDED THEIR AUTHORITY AS THEY COULD NOT LEGALLY GRANT A SPECIAL PRIVILEGE
4108-12546-0022 CONSIDERING THAT NO ONE WAS LIKELY TO TEST THE LEGALITY OF THE ORDINANCE HE THOUGHT I WOULD BE SAFE IN ACTING AS THOUGH IT WERE LEGAL JUST THIRTY DAYS FROM THE TIME I HAD THE BOTHER WITH THE POLICEMEN AND HAVING INCURRED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS OF EXTRA EXPENSE
4108-12546-0023 WITHOUT GETTING INTO ANY SERIOUS SCRAPE EXCEPT WITH ONE AUTOMOBILIST WHO BECAME ANGERED BUT AFTERWARDS WAS AS GOOD AS PIE THIRTY DAYS SATISFIED ME WITH NEW YORK
4108-12546-0024 AND I WOULD BE COMPELLED TO MOVE
4108-12546-0025 AND AT NIGHTFALL DROVE INTO A STABLE PUT THE OXEN IN THE STALLS AND AS USUAL THE DOG JIM IN THE WAGON THE NEXT MORNING JIM WAS GONE THE STABLEMAN SAID HE HAD LEFT THE WAGON A FEW MOMENTS AFTER I HAD AND HAD BEEN STOLEN
4108-12546-0026 THE POLICE ACCUSED THE STABLEMEN OF BEING PARTIES TO THE THEFT IN WHICH I THINK THEY WERE RIGHT MONEY COULD NOT BUY THAT DOG HE WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE EXPEDITION ALWAYS ON THE ALERT
4108-12546-0027 ALWAYS WATCHFUL OF THE WAGON DURING MY ABSENCE AND ALWAYS WILLING TO MIND WHAT I BADE HIM DO HE HAD HAD MORE ADVENTURES ON THIS TRIP THAN ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE OUTFIT
4108-12546-0028 THEN SHORTLY AFTER HE WAS PITCHED HEADLONG OVER A BARBED WIRE FENCE BY AN IRATE COW NEXT CAME A FIGHT WITH A WOLF FOLLOWING THIS CAME A NARROW ESCAPE FROM A RATTLESNAKE IN THE ROAD ALSO A TROLLEY CAR RAN ON TO HIM
4108-12546-0029 ROLLING HIM OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL HE CAME OUT AS DIZZY AS A DRUNKEN MAN I THOUGHT HE WAS A GONER THAT TIME FOR SURE BUT HE SOON STRAIGHTENED UP FINALLY IN THE STREETS OF KANSAS CITY HE WAS RUN OVER BY A HEAVY TRUCK WHILE FIGHTING WITH ANOTHER DOG
4108-12546-0030 THE OTHER DOG WAS KILLED OUTRIGHT WHILE JIM CAME NEAR TO HAVING HIS NECK BROKEN HE LOST ONE OF HIS BEST FIGHTING TEETH AND HAD SEVERAL OTHERS BROKEN I SENT HIM TO A VETERINARY SURGEON AND
4108-12546-0031 CURIOUSLY ENOUGH HE MADE NO PROTEST WHILE HAVING THE BROKEN TEETH REPAIRED OR EXTRACTED THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY TO FIND JIM THAN TO OFFER A REWARD I DID THIS AND FEEL SURE I PAID TWENTY DOLLARS TO ONE OF THE PARTIES TO THE THEFT
4108-12546-0032 THE FELLOW WAS BRAZEN ENOUGH ALSO TO DEMAND PAY FOR KEEPING HIM THAT WAS THE TIME WHEN I GOT UP AND TALKED POINTEDLY BUT I HAD MY FAITHFUL DOG BACK AND I KEPT HIM MORE CLOSELY BY ME WHILE I WAS MAKING THE REST OF MY TOUR
4108-12546-0033 SIX YEARS LATER IT CHANCED THAT I LOST JIM WHILE WE WERE WAITING AT A STATION I LET HIM OUT OF THE CAR FOR A FEW MINUTES
