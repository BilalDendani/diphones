6459-70120-0000 THE EAGLE SAILS BOB HAD OFTEN BEEN ON RAILROAD JOURNEYS SO THERE WAS NOTHING ESPECIALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THE FIRST PART OF HIS TRIP
6459-70120-0001 AS THE TRAIN SPED ON OUT OF THE VILLAGE SEEMED FULL OF DELIGHT TO HIM WELL I S'POSE YOU'VE BEEN PRETTY STEADY SINCE I'VE BEEN GONE HAVEN'T YOU BOB ASKED THE CAPTAIN FOLLOWING A RATHER LONG PAUSE
6459-70120-0002 WELL PRETTY GOOD I GUESS I ONLY PLAYED ONE JOKE WHAT WAS IT BOB RELATED THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE STEP LADDER THE COOK AND THE HIRED MAN HUM
6459-70120-0003 YES REPLIED BOB TRYING NOT TO CHUCKLE AT THE RECOLLECTION HUM REMARKED THE CAPTAIN AGAIN AND HE SEEMED TO BE HAVING SOME DIFFICULTY WITH HIS BREATHING BOB WONDERED IF HIS FRIEND WAS CHOKING HE WAS SO VERY RED IN THE FACE
6459-70120-0004 BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THE MARINER WAS TRYING HARD NOT TO LAUGH THE THOUGHT OF THE SIGHT OF THE PAIR TANGLED UP IN THE STEP LADDER WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM
6459-70120-0005 IN HIS RECKLESS WAYS BY SHOWING ENOUGH INTEREST TO LAUGH BY THE WAY WENT ON THE CAPTAIN SUDDENLY BECOMING RATHER SOLEMN I S'POSE YOU'VE LEARNED THE PRINCIPAL PARTS OF THE SHIP BY NOW BY NAMES YES SIR BUT I'M AFRAID I'VE GOT LOTS YET TO LEARN
6459-70120-0006 YOU KNOW ABOUT AS MUCH HOW TO SAIL A SHIP
6459-70120-0007 CAPTAIN SPARK BELIEVED IN MAKING BOYS KNOW THEIR PLACE
6459-70120-0008 STILL HE WAS DETERMINED TO REFORM HIM IF IT WAS POSSIBLE
6459-70120-0009 ASKED BOB AS HE THOUGHT OF THE SECRET MAP CAPTAIN OBED HAD GIVEN HIM IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT WEATHER WE HAVE WHY HERE'S SOMETHING A FRIEND OF MINE GAVE ME SAID BOB PULLING OUT THE WRINKLED PIECE OF PARCHMENT
6459-70120-0010 HE SAYS THERE IS TREASURE BURIED ON AN ISLAND IN THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC TREASURE
6459-70120-0011 HE REMARKED HANDING THE PARCHMENT BACK
6459-70120-0012 A JOKE YES THAT'S A MAP SURE ENOUGH BUT NO SAILOR COULD EVER FIND THE ISLAND BY THOSE DIRECTIONS WHY NOT I SAID HE NEVER COULD
6459-70120-0013 WHY LOOK BOB WHOEVER MADE THIS MAP ONLY MARKED THE LOCATION OF THE ISLAND BY DEGREES
6459-70120-0014 EVERY CIRCLE IS DIVIDED INTO THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DEGREES AND AS THE EARTH IS ROUND IT FOLLOWS THAT A CIRCLE DRAWN AROUND IT WOULD BE THE SAME EACH DEGREE THEREFORE MEANS A DISTANCE AT THE EQUATOR OF ABOUT SEVENTY MILES
6459-70120-0015 SO UNLESS WHOEVER DREW THIS MAP IS POSITIVE THAT THE ISLAND IS EXACTLY AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE DEGREES OF LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE WHICH YOU HAVE GIVEN ME IT MIGHT BE SEVENTY MILES ONE WAY OR THE OTHER OFF FROM THE LOCATION GIVEN HERE
6459-70120-0016 BESIDES THE MAP ONLY STATES THAT THE LOCATION IS ABOUT RIGHT I GUESS WE'LL NEVER FIND THAT TREASURE BOB I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S THERE WOULD YOU THINK IT WORTH TRYING FOR
6459-70120-0017 I MIGHT HAVE TO SAIL AROUND FOR A WEEK MERELY TO LOCATE THE ISLAND AND THE CHANCES WOULD BE I'D MISS IT THEN IF I DID FIND IT
6459-70120-0018 I DON'T TAKE ANY STOCK IN THOSE CAPTAIN KIDD YARNS THERE'S TOO MANY OF EM BEING SPUN BY RETIRED SAILORS IF CAPTAIN KIDD HAD ANY MONEY HE TOOK GOOD CARE OF IT YOU CAN WAGER BESIDES I HAVEN'T ANY TIME TO FOOL AROUND LOOKING FOR AN ISLAND
6459-70120-0019 I HAVE TO GET MY CARGO TO PORT ON TIME BOB WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT HE COULD NOT TAKE PART IN A SEARCH FOR CAPTAIN OBED'S TREASURE BUT HE REFLECTED THAT WHAT CAPTAIN SPARK SAID WAS PROBABLY RIGHT RESIDES
6459-70120-0020 THE AGED MAN'S MIND WAS NOT TO BE DEPENDED ON DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE JOURNEY BY RAIL CAPTAIN SPARK GAVE BOB SOME GOOD ADVICE AS TO HOW TO CONDUCT HIMSELF WHILE ABOARD THE SHIP
6459-70120-0021 HE IMPARTED SOME USEFUL INFORMATION CONCERNING NAVIGATION AND PROMISED TO SHOW BOB MORE ABOUT IT AFTER THEY HAD SAILED I'M ANXIOUS TO GET OUT ON DEEP WATER SAID THE MARINER I DON'T LIKE THIS CITY LIFE
6459-70120-0022 THERE ARE TOO MANY RISKS IN IT IN DUE TIME THEY ARRIVED AT THE SEAPORT TOWN AND HAVING SEEN THAT BOB'S BAGGAGE WOULD BE TRANSPORTED TO THE DOCK CAPTAIN SPARK LED THE WAY TO WHERE THE EAGLE WAS WAITING THE HOISTING OF HER WHITE SAILS
6459-70120-0023 TO CATCH THE OCEAN BREEZES THE SHIP WAS A LARGE ONE SQUARE RIGGED AND HAD THREE MASTS IT BEING OF GOOD TONNAGE
6459-70120-0024 AND THIS HAD CAUSED A LITTLE DELAY NOT ALL THE FREIGHT WAS ABOARD YET WELL MISTER CARR HOW ARE THINGS MOVING ASKED THE CAPTAIN OF A TALL THIN MAN WHO STOOD NEAR THE GANGWAY AS HE AND BOB WENT UP THE PLANK
6459-70120-0025 BY THE WAY LET ME INTRODUCE A FRIEND OF MINE THIS IS BOB HENDERSON HIS MOTHER IS A RELATIVE OF MINE AND BOB IS TAKING A VOYAGE FOR HIS HEALTH BOB THIS IS MY FIRST MATE MISTER CARR HE LOOKS HEALTHY ENOUGH
6459-70120-0026 REMARKED THE FIRST MATE AS HE CORDIALLY SHOOK HANDS WITH BOB THINGS ARE NOT ALWAYS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE REPLIED THE CAPTAIN WITH A SMILE BOB FOUND MATTERS RATHER TOO LIVELY FOR HIM ASHORE AND HIS FOLKS THINK IT WILL QUIET HIM DOWN TO GO WITH ME

6459-70120-0028 YOU CAN LOOK ABOUT A BIT WHILE I GO BELOW AND WORK ON MY MANIFEST MISTER CARR WILL TELL YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW BUT BOB WAS SO INTERESTED IN WATCHING THE SAILORS AT WORK STOWING AWAY THE CARGO WHILE OTHERS WERE CLEANING VARIOUS PARTS OF THE SHIP
6459-70120-0029 THAT HE DID NOT ASK MANY QUESTIONS ALL THE REST OF THAT DAY THE LOADING WENT ON BOB AND THE CAPTAIN WENT ASHORE FOR THEIR MEALS
6459-70120-0030 BUT BOB SPENT THAT NIGHT IN HIS BUNK
6459-70120-0031 AND BY NOON ALL THE CARGO WAS STOWED AWAY CAPTAIN SPARK WAS BELOW IN HIS CABIN MAKING OUT THE FINAL PAPERS AND WAITING FOR HIS CLEARANCE DOCUMENTS FROM THE HARBOR MASTER MISTER CARR AND HIS ASSISTANTS WERE BUSY GETTING THE EAGLE READY TO SAIL
6459-70120-0032 WHILE BOB STOOD NEAR THE RAIL WATCHING WITH CURIOUS EYES EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON WHILE HE STOOD THERE HE SAW A SHORT STOUT PALE FACED MAN COMING UP THE GANGPLANK THE MAN CARRIED A VALISE IN EACH HAND

6459-70120-0037 I DON'T WANT ANY MISTAKE MADE I DON'T SEE THE NAME ON IT ANYWHERE IT IS ON THE BOWS AND UNDER THE STERN BOB RATHER PRIDED HIMSELF ON THIS NAUTICAL KNOWLEDGE HUM

6459-70120-0044 FIRST HE WOULD ADVANCE A LITTLE WAY TOWARD THE CAPTAIN INTENDING TO ASK HIM THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION THEN HE WOULD TURN TOWARD THE LONGSHOREMAN WHO WAS WAITING FOR HIS MONEY LIVELY WITH THAT GANGPLANK NOW ORDERED THE COMMANDER
6459-70120-0045 OH IF I HAVE MADE A MISTAKE AND GOTTEN ON THE WRONG SHIP IT WILL BE TERRIBLE MURMURED THE MAN WHY DON'T YOU THROW OFF THAT STERN LINE AGAIN SHOUTED THE CAPTAIN WHAT SHALL I DO EXCLAIMED THE NERVOUS MAN
