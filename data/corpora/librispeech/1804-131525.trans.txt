1804-131525-0000 WHO ENTERTAINED AN IDEA THAT THE MYSTERIOUS OCCUPANT OF WILDFELL HALL WOULD WHOLLY DISREGARD THE COMMON OBSERVANCES OF CIVILIZED LIFE IN WHICH OPINION SHE WAS SUPPORTED BY THE WILSONS WHO TESTIFIED THAT NEITHER THEIR CALL
1804-131525-0001 NOR THE MILLWARDS HAD BEEN RETURNED AS YET NOW HOWEVER THE CAUSE OF THAT OMISSION WAS EXPLAINED
1804-131525-0002 MISSUS GRAHAM HAD BROUGHT HER CHILD WITH HER AND ON MY MOTHER'S EXPRESSING SURPRISE THAT HE COULD WALK SO FAR SHE REPLIED
1804-131525-0003 FOR I NEVER LEAVE HIM ALONE AND I THINK MISSUS MARKHAM I MUST BEG YOU TO MAKE MY EXCUSES TO THE MILLWARDS AND MISSUS WILSON WHEN YOU SEE THEM AS I FEAR I CANNOT DO MYSELF THE PLEASURE OF CALLING UPON THEM
1804-131525-0004 BUT YOU HAVE A SERVANT SAID ROSE COULD YOU NOT LEAVE HIM WITH HER SHE HAS HER OWN OCCUPATIONS TO ATTEND TO
1804-131525-0005 AND HE IS TOO MERCURIAL TO BE TIED TO AN ELDERLY WOMAN BUT YOU LEFT HIM TO COME TO CHURCH
1804-131525-0006 AND I THINK IN FUTURE I MUST CONTRIVE TO BRING HIM WITH ME OR STAY AT HOME IS HE SO MISCHIEVOUS ASKED MY MOTHER CONSIDERABLY SHOCKED NO REPLIED THE LADY
1804-131525-0007 SADLY SMILING AS SHE STROKED THE WAVY LOCKS OF HER SON WHO WAS SEATED ON A LOW STOOL AT HER FEET BUT HE IS MY ONLY TREASURE AND I AM HIS ONLY FRIEND SO WE DON'T LIKE TO BE SEPARATED BUT MY DEAR I CALL THAT DOTING
1804-131525-0008 AS WELL TO SAVE YOUR SON FROM RUIN AS YOURSELF FROM RIDICULE RUIN MISSUS MARKHAM YES IT IS SPOILING THE CHILD
1804-131525-0009 BUT SHE SEEMED TO THINK ENOUGH HAD BEEN SAID ON THE SUBJECT AND ABRUPTLY TURNED THE CONVERSATION JUST AS I THOUGHT SAID I TO MYSELF THE LADY'S TEMPER IS NONE OF THE MILDEST NOTWITHSTANDING HER SWEET PALE FACE AND LOFTY BROW
1804-131525-0010 WHERE THOUGHT AND SUFFERING SEEM EQUALLY TO HAVE STAMPED THEIR IMPRESS
1804-131525-0011 APPARENTLY IMMERSED IN THE PERUSAL OF A VOLUME OF THE FARMER'S MAGAZINE
1804-131525-0012 AND NOT CHOOSING TO BE OVER CIVIL I HAD MERELY BOWED AS SHE ENTERED AND CONTINUED MY OCCUPATION AS BEFORE IN A LITTLE WHILE HOWEVER I WAS SENSIBLE THAT SOME ONE WAS APPROACHING ME WITH A LIGHT BUT SLOW AND HESITATING TREAD
1804-131525-0013 IT WAS LITTLE ARTHUR
1804-131525-0014 THAT WAS LYING AT MY FEET ON LOOKING UP I BEHELD HIM STANDING ABOUT TWO YARDS OFF WITH HIS CLEAR BLUE EYES WISTFULLY GAZING ON THE DOG TRANSFIXED TO THE SPOT
1804-131525-0015 BUT BY A TIMID DISINCLINATION TO APPROACH ITS MASTER A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT HOWEVER INDUCED HIM TO COME FORWARD THE CHILD THOUGH SHY WAS NOT SULLEN IN A MINUTE HE WAS KNEELING ON THE CARPET
1804-131525-0016 SURVEYING WITH EAGER INTEREST THE VARIOUS SPECIMENS OF HORSES CATTLE PIGS AND MODEL FARMS
1804-131525-0017 AND I SAW BY THE UNQUIET ASPECT OF HER EYE THAT FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER SHE WAS UNEASY AT THE CHILD'S POSITION ARTHUR
1804-131525-0018 COME HERE YOU ARE TROUBLESOME TO MISTER MARKHAM HE WISHES TO READ BY NO MEANS MISSUS GRAHAM PRAY LET HIM STAY I AM AS MUCH AMUSED AS HE IS PLEADED I BUT STILL WITH HAND AND EYE SHE SILENTLY CALLED HIM TO HER SIDE
1804-131525-0019 NO MAMMA SAID THE CHILD
1804-131525-0020 THEY WILL ALL BE HERE I EXPECT THANK YOU I NEVER GO TO PARTIES OH BUT THIS WILL BE QUITE A FAMILY CONCERN
1804-131525-0021 I DO KNOW SOMETHING OF HIM BUT YOU MUST EXCUSE ME THIS TIME
1804-131525-0022 WE MUST DEFER THE ENJOYMENT OF YOUR HOSPITALITY
1804-131525-0023 ROSE NOW AT A HINT FROM MY MOTHER PRODUCED A DECANTER OF WINE WITH ACCOMPANIMENTS OF GLASSES AND CAKE FROM THE CUPBOARD AND THE OAK SIDEBOARD AND THE REFRESHMENT WAS DULY PRESENTED TO THE GUESTS
1804-131525-0024 ARTHUR ESPECIALLY SHRANK FROM THE RUBY NECTAR
1804-131525-0025 NEVER MIND ARTHUR SAID HIS MAMMA MISSUS MARKHAM THINKS IT WILL DO YOU GOOD AS YOU WERE TIRED WITH YOUR WALK BUT SHE WILL NOT OBLIGE YOU TO TAKE IT
1804-131525-0026 HE DETESTS THE VERY SIGHT OF WINE SHE ADDED AND THE SMELL OF IT ALMOST MAKES HIM SICK
1804-131525-0027 BY WAY OF MEDICINE WHEN HE WAS SICK
1804-131525-0028 EVERYBODY LAUGHED EXCEPT THE YOUNG WIDOW AND HER SON WELL MISSUS GRAHAM SAID MY MOTHER WIPING THE TEARS OF MERRIMENT FROM HER BRIGHT BLUE EYES
1804-131525-0029 IF YOU PERSIST IN I THINK IT A VERY EXCELLENT PLAN INTERRUPTED MISSUS GRAHAM WITH IMPERTURBABLE GRAVITY
1804-131525-0030 BY THAT MEANS I HOPE TO SAVE HIM FROM ONE DEGRADING VICE AT LEAST I WISH I COULD RENDER THE INCENTIVES TO EVERY OTHER EQUALLY INNOXIOUS IN HIS CASE BUT BY SUCH MEANS SAID I YOU WILL NEVER RENDER HIM VIRTUOUS
1804-131525-0031 WHAT IS IT THAT CONSTITUTES VIRTUE MISSUS GRAHAM
1804-131525-0032 OR THAT OF HAVING NO TEMPTATIONS TO RESIST IS HE A STRONG MAN THAT OVERCOMES GREAT OBSTACLES AND PERFORMS SURPRISING ACHIEVEMENTS THOUGH BY DINT OF GREAT MUSCULAR EXERTION
1804-131525-0033 AND CARRYING HIS FOOD TO HIS MOUTH
1804-131525-0034 BUT TEACH HIM TO WALK FIRMLY OVER THEM
1804-131525-0035 IT IS ALL VERY WELL TO TALK ABOUT NOBLE RESISTANCE AND TRIALS OF VIRTUE BUT FOR FIFTY OR FIVE HUNDRED MEN THAT HAVE YIELDED TO TEMPTATION
1804-131525-0036 LIKE THE REST OF MANKIND UNLESS I TAKE CARE TO PREVENT IT YOU ARE VERY COMPLIMENTARY TO US ALL I OBSERVED I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT YOU I SPEAK OF THOSE I DO KNOW
1804-131525-0037 AND WHEN I SEE THE WHOLE RACE OF MANKIND WITH A FEW RARE EXCEPTIONS
1804-131525-0038 YES BUT THE SUREST MEANS WILL BE TO ENDEAVOUR TO FORTIFY HIM AGAINST TEMPTATION NOT TO REMOVE IT OUT OF HIS WAY I WILL DO BOTH MISTER MARKHAM GOD KNOWS HE WILL HAVE TEMPTATIONS ENOUGH TO ASSAIL HIM
1804-131525-0039 BOTH FROM WITHIN AND WITHOUT WHEN I HAVE DONE ALL I CAN TO RENDER VICE AS UNINVITING TO HIM AS IT IS ABOMINABLE IN ITS OWN NATURE I MYSELF HAVE HAD INDEED BUT FEW INCENTIVES TO WHAT THE WORLD CALLS VICE
1804-131525-0040 THAT HAVE REQUIRED ON MANY OCCASIONS MORE WATCHFULNESS AND FIRMNESS TO RESIST THAN I HAVE HITHERTO BEEN ABLE TO MUSTER AGAINST THEM AND THIS I BELIEVE IS WHAT MOST OTHERS WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO REFLECTION
1804-131525-0041 AND WISHFUL TO STRIVE AGAINST THEIR NATURAL CORRUPTIONS YES SAID MY MOTHER BUT HALF APPREHENDING HER DRIFT
1804-131525-0042 AND MY DEAR MISSUS GRAHAM LET ME WARN YOU IN GOOD TIME AGAINST THE ERROR THE FATAL ERROR I MAY CALL IT OF TAKING THAT BOY'S EDUCATION UPON YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU ARE CLEVER IN SOME THINGS AND WELL INFORMED YOU MAY FANCY YOURSELF EQUAL TO THE TASK
1804-131525-0043 BUT INDEED YOU ARE NOT AND IF YOU PERSIST IN THE ATTEMPT BELIEVE ME YOU WILL BITTERLY REPENT IT WHEN THE MISCHIEF IS DONE I AM TO SEND HIM TO SCHOOL I SUPPOSE TO LEARN TO DESPISE HIS MOTHER'S AUTHORITY AND AFFECTION
1804-131525-0044 OH NO BUT IF YOU WOULD HAVE A BOY TO DESPISE HIS MOTHER
1804-131525-0045 I PERFECTLY AGREE WITH YOU MISSUS MARKHAM BUT NOTHING CAN BE FURTHER FROM MY PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE THAN SUCH CRIMINAL WEAKNESS AS THAT
1804-131525-0046 AND TELL YOU WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO AND ALL ABOUT IT AND I DON'T DOUBT HE'LL BE ABLE TO CONVINCE YOU IN A MINUTE NO OCCASION TO TROUBLE THE VICAR SAID MISSUS GRAHAM GLANCING AT ME
1804-131525-0047 IF I HEAR NOT HIM NEITHER SHOULD I BE CONVINCED THOUGH ONE ROSE FROM THE DEAD HE WOULD TELL YOU
1804-131525-0048 BUT SENT OUT TO BATTLE AGAINST IT ALONE AND UNASSISTED NOT TAUGHT TO AVOID THE SNARES OF LIFE BUT BOLDLY TO RUSH INTO THEM OR OVER THEM AS HE MAY TO SEEK DANGER RATHER THAN SHUN IT AND FEED HIS VIRTUE BY TEMPTATION WOULD YOU
1804-131525-0049 I ONLY SAY THAT IT IS BETTER TO ARM AND STRENGTHEN YOUR HERO THAN TO DISARM AND ENFEEBLE THE FOE AND IF YOU WERE TO REAR AN OAK SAPLING IN A HOTHOUSE TENDING IT CAREFULLY NIGHT AND DAY AND SHIELDING IT FROM EVERY BREATH OF WIND
1804-131525-0050 YOU COULD NOT EXPECT IT TO BECOME A HARDY TREE LIKE THAT WHICH HAS GROWN UP ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE
1804-131525-0051 AND NOT EVEN SHELTERED FROM THE SHOCK OF THE TEMPEST GRANTED BUT WOULD YOU USE THE SAME ARGUMENT WITH REGARD TO A GIRL CERTAINLY NOT
1804-131525-0052 YOU WOULD HAVE HER TO BE TENDERLY AND DELICATELY NURTURED LIKE A HOT HOUSE PLANT TAUGHT TO CLING TO OTHERS FOR DIRECTION AND SUPPORT AND GUARDED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FROM THE VERY KNOWLEDGE OF EVIL BUT WILL YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO INFORM ME WHY YOU MAKE THIS DISTINCTION
1804-131525-0053 IS IT THAT YOU THINK SHE HAS NO VIRTUE ASSUREDLY NOT WELL BUT YOU AFFIRM THAT VIRTUE IS ONLY ELICITED BY TEMPTATION AND YOU THINK THAT A WOMAN CANNOT BE TOO LITTLE EXPOSED TO TEMPTATION OR TOO LITTLE ACQUAINTED WITH VICE
1804-131525-0054 OR ANYTHING CONNECTED THEREWITH IT MUST BE EITHER THAT YOU THINK SHE IS ESSENTIALLY SO VICIOUS OR SO FEEBLE MINDED THAT SHE CANNOT WITHSTAND TEMPTATION AND THOUGH SHE MAY BE PURE AND INNOCENT AS LONG AS SHE IS KEPT IN IGNORANCE AND RESTRAINT
1804-131525-0055 TO TEACH HER HOW TO SIN IS AT ONCE TO MAKE HER A SINNER AND THE GREATER HER KNOWLEDGE THE WIDER HER LIBERTY THE DEEPER WILL BE HER DEPRAVITY WHEREAS IN THE NOBLER SEX THERE IS A NATURAL TENDENCY TO GOODNESS
1804-131525-0056 WELL THEN IT MUST BE THAT YOU THINK THEY ARE BOTH WEAK AND PRONE TO ERR AND THE SLIGHTEST ERROR THE MEREST SHADOW OF POLLUTION WILL RUIN THE ONE WHILE THE CHARACTER OF THE OTHER WILL BE STRENGTHENED AND EMBELLISHED
1804-131525-0057 SUCH EXPERIENCE TO HIM TO USE A TRITE SIMILE WILL BE LIKE THE STORM TO THE OAK WHICH THOUGH IT MAY SCATTER THE LEAVES AND SNAP THE SMALLER BRANCHES
1804-131525-0058 WHILE OUR DAUGHTERS MUST NOT EVEN PROFIT BY THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS NOW I WOULD HAVE BOTH SO TO BENEFIT BY THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS AND THE PRECEPTS OF A HIGHER AUTHORITY THAT THEY SHOULD KNOW BEFOREHAND TO REFUSE THE EVIL AND CHOOSE THE GOOD
1804-131525-0059 AND REQUIRE NO EXPERIMENTAL PROOFS TO TEACH THEM THE EVIL OF TRANSGRESSION I WOULD NOT SEND A POOR GIRL INTO THE WORLD UNARMED AGAINST HER FOES AND IGNORANT OF THE SNARES THAT BESET HER PATH
1804-131525-0060 NOR WOULD I WATCH AND GUARD HER TILL DEPRIVED OF SELF RESPECT AND SELF RELIANCE SHE LOST THE POWER OR THE WILL TO WATCH AND GUARD HERSELF AND AS FOR MY SON
1804-131525-0061 WHAT YOU CALL A MAN OF THE WORLD ONE THAT HAS SEEN LIFE AND GLORIES IN HIS EXPERIENCE EVEN THOUGH HE SHOULD SO FAR PROFIT BY IT AS TO SOBER DOWN AT LENGTH
1804-131525-0062 I WOULD RATHER THAT HE DIED TO MORROW RATHER A THOUSAND TIMES SHE EARNESTLY REPEATED PRESSING HER DARLING TO HER SIDE AND KISSING HIS FOREHEAD WITH INTENSE AFFECTION HE HAD ALREADY LEFT HIS NEW COMPANION
1804-131525-0063 AND BEEN STANDING FOR SOME TIME BESIDE HIS MOTHER'S KNEE LOOKING UP INTO HER FACE AND LISTENING IN SILENT WONDER TO HER INCOMPREHENSIBLE DISCOURSE WELL YOU LADIES MUST ALWAYS HAVE THE LAST WORD I SUPPOSE
1804-131525-0064 SAID I OBSERVING HER RISE AND BEGIN TO TAKE LEAVE OF MY MOTHER YOU MAY HAVE AS MANY WORDS AS YOU PLEASE ONLY I CAN'T STAY TO HEAR THEM NO THAT IS THE WAY YOU HEAR JUST AS MUCH OF AN ARGUMENT AS YOU PLEASE AND THE REST MAY BE SPOKEN TO THE WIND
1804-131525-0065 REPLIED SHE AS SHE SHOOK HANDS WITH ROSE YOU MUST BRING YOUR SISTER TO SEE ME SOME FINE DAY AND I'LL LISTEN AS PATIENTLY AS YOU COULD WISH TO WHATEVER YOU PLEASE TO SAY
1804-131525-0066 BECAUSE I SHOULD HAVE LESS REMORSE IN TELLING YOU AT THE END OF THE DISCOURSE THAT I PRESERVE MY OWN OPINION PRECISELY THE SAME AS AT THE BEGINNING AS WOULD BE THE CASE I AM PERSUADED WITH REGARD TO EITHER LOGICIAN
1804-131525-0067 YES OF COURSE REPLIED I DETERMINED TO BE AS PROVOKING AS HERSELF FOR WHEN A LADY DOES CONSENT TO LISTEN TO AN ARGUMENT AGAINST HER OWN OPINIONS SHE IS ALWAYS PREDETERMINED TO WITHSTAND IT TO LISTEN ONLY WITH HER BODILY EARS
1804-131525-0068 GOOD MORNING MISTER MARKHAM SAID MY FAIR ANTAGONIST WITH A PITYING SMILE AND DEIGNING NO FURTHER REJOINDER SHE SLIGHTLY BOWED AND WAS ABOUT TO WITHDRAW BUT HER SON WITH CHILDISH IMPERTINENCE ARRESTED HER BY EXCLAIMING
1804-131525-0069 SHE LAUGHINGLY TURNED ROUND AND HELD OUT HER HAND I GAVE IT A SPITEFUL SQUEEZE
1804-131525-0070 WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT MY REAL DISPOSITION AND PRINCIPLES SHE WAS EVIDENTLY PREJUDICED AGAINST ME AND SEEMED BENT UPON SHOWING ME THAT HER OPINIONS RESPECTING ME ON EVERY PARTICULAR FELL FAR BELOW THOSE I ENTERTAINED OF MYSELF
1804-131525-0071 I WAS NATURALLY TOUCHY OR IT WOULD NOT HAVE VEXED ME SO MUCH
