1639-132848-0000 MANAWYDDAN THE PRINCE AND HIS FRIEND PRYDERI WERE WANDERERS
1639-132848-0001 VERY SORROWFUL WAS MANAWYDDAN BUT PRYDERI WAS STOUT OF HEART AND BADE HIM BE OF GOOD CHEER AS HE KNEW A WAY OUT OF HIS TROUBLE AND WHAT MAY THAT BE ASKED MANAWYDDAN IT IS THAT THOU MARRY MY MOTHER RHIANNON AND BECOME LORD OF THE FAIR LANDS THAT I WILL GIVE HER FOR DOWRY
1639-132848-0002 NEVER DID ANY LADY HAVE MORE WIT THAN SHE AND IN HER YOUTH NONE WAS MORE LOVELY EVEN YET SHE IS GOOD TO LOOK UPON THOU ART THE BEST FRIEND THAT EVER A MAN HAD SAID MANAWYDDAN
1639-132848-0003 AND THE LANDS WHERE SHE DWELLS THEN THEY SET FORTH BUT THE NEWS OF THEIR COMING RAN SWIFTER STILL
1639-132848-0004 AND MANAWYDDAN FOUND THAT PRYDERI HAD SPOKEN THE TRUTH CONCERNING HIS MOTHER AND ASKED IF SHE WOULD TAKE HIM FOR HER HUSBAND RIGHT GLADLY DID SHE CONSENT AND WITHOUT DELAY THEY WERE MARRIED AND RODE AWAY TO THE HUNT RHIANNON AND MANAWYDDAN KIEVA AND PRYDERI
1639-132848-0005 AND THEY WOULD NOT BE PARTED FROM EACH OTHER BY NIGHT OR BY DAY SO GREAT WAS THE LOVE BETWEEN THEM ONE DAY WHEN THEY WERE RETURNED THEY WERE SITTING OUT IN A GREEN PLACE AND SUDDENLY THE CRASH OF THUNDER STRUCK LOUDLY ON THEIR EARS AND A WALL OF MIST FELL BETWEEN THEM
1639-132848-0006 TREMBLING THEY SAT TILL THE DARKNESS FLED AND THE LIGHT SHONE AGAIN UPON THEM BUT IN THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE WONT TO SEE CATTLE AND HERDS AND DWELLINGS THEY BEHELD NEITHER HOUSE NOR BEAST NOR MAN NOR SMOKE
1639-132848-0007 NEITHER WAS ANY ONE REMAINING IN THE GREEN PLACE SAVE THESE FOUR ONLY WHITHER HAVE THEY GONE AND MY HOST ALSO CRIED MANAWYDDAN AND THEY SEARCHED THE HALL AND THERE WAS NO MAN
1639-132848-0008 AND IN THE DWELLINGS THAT WERE LEFT WAS NOTHING SAVE WILD BEASTS FOR A YEAR THESE FOUR FED ON THE MEAT THAT MANAWYDDAN AND PRYDERI KILLED OUT HUNTING AND THE HONEY OF THE BEES THAT SUCKED THE MOUNTAIN HEATHER FOR A TIME THEY DESIRED NOTHING MORE
1639-132848-0009 BUT WHEN THE NEXT YEAR BEGAN THEY GREW WEARY WE CANNOT SPEND OUR LIVES THUS SAID MANAWYDDAN AT LAST LET US GO INTO ENGLAND AND LEARN SOME TRADE BY WHICH WE MAY LIVE SO THEY LEFT WALES AND WENT TO HEREFORD
1639-132848-0010 AND THERE THEY MADE SADDLES WHILE MANAWYDDAN FASHIONED BLUE ENAMEL ORNAMENTS TO PUT ON THEIR TRAPPINGS AND SO GREATLY DID THE TOWNSFOLK LOVE THESE SADDLES THAT NO OTHERS WERE BOUGHT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF HEREFORD
1639-132848-0011 TILL THE SADDLERS BANDED TOGETHER AND RESOLVED TO SLAY MANAWYDDAN AND HIS COMPANIONS WHEN PRYDERI HEARD OF IT HE WAS VERY WROTH AND WISHED TO STAY AND FIGHT BUT THE COUNSELS OF MANAWYDDAN PREVAILED AND THEY MOVED BY NIGHT TO ANOTHER CITY

1639-132848-0016 AND I WILL TEACH THEE TO STITCH WE WILL BUY THE LEATHER READY DRESSED AND WILL MAKE THE SHOES FROM IT THEN STRAIGHTWAY HE SOUGHT THE TOWN FOR THE BEST LEATHER
1639-132848-0017 AND HE HIMSELF WATCHED TILL IT WAS DONE SO THAT HE MIGHT LEARN FOR HIMSELF
1639-132848-0018 AND PROSPERED SO GREATLY THAT AS LONG AS ONE COULD BE BOUGHT FROM HIM NOT A SHOE WAS PURCHASED FROM THE SHOEMAKERS OF THE TOWN AND THE CRAFTSMEN WERE WROTH AND BANDED TOGETHER TO SLAY THEM PRYDERI SAID MANAWYDDAN WHEN HE HAD RECEIVED NEWS OF IT
1639-132848-0019 SO THEY JOURNEYED UNTIL THEY CAME TO THEIR LANDS AT NARBERTH THERE THEY GATHERED THEIR DOGS ROUND THEM AND HUNTED FOR A YEAR AS BEFORE AFTER THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
1639-132848-0020 ONE MORNING PRYDERI AND MANAWYDDAN ROSE UP TO HUNT AND LOOSENED THEIR DOGS WHICH RAN BEFORE THEM TILL THEY CAME TO A SMALL BUSH AT THE BUSH THE DOGS SHRANK AWAY AS IF FRIGHTENED AND RETURNED TO THEIR MASTERS THEIR HAIR BRISLING ON THEIR BACKS
1639-132848-0021 WE MUST SEE WHAT IS IN THAT BUSH SAID PRYDERI AND WHAT WAS IN IT WAS A BOAR WITH A SKIN AS WHITE AS THE SNOW ON THE MOUNTAINS AND HE CAME OUT AND MADE A STAND AS THE DOGS RUSHED ON HIM DRIVEN ON BY THE MEN LONG HE STOOD AT BAY
1639-132848-0022 THEN AT LAST HE BETOOK HIMSELF TO FLIGHT AND FLED TO A CASTLE WHICH WAS NEWLY BUILT IN A PLACE WHERE NO BUILDING HAD EVER BEEN KNOWN INTO THE CASTLE HE RAN AND THE DOGS AFTER HIM AND LONG THOUGH THEIR MASTERS LOOKED AND LISTENED
1639-132848-0023 THEY NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD AUGHT CONCERNING DOGS OR BOAR I WILL GO INTO THE CASTLE AND GET TIDINGS OF THE DOGS SAID PRYDERI AT LAST TRULY ANSWERED MANAWYDDAN THOU WOULDST DO UNWISELY FOR WHOSOEVER HAS CAST A SPELL OVER THIS LAND HAS SET THIS CASTLE HERE
1639-132848-0024 I CANNOT GIVE UP MY DOGS REPLIED PRYDERI AND TO THE CASTLE HE WENT BUT WITHIN WAS NEITHER MAN NOR BEAST NEITHER BOAR NOR DOGS BUT ONLY A FOUNTAIN WITH MARBLE ROUND IT AND ON THE EDGE A GOLDEN BOWL RICHLY WROUGHT
1639-132848-0025 WHICH PLEASED PRYDERI GREATLY IN A MOMENT HE FORGOT ABOUT HIS DOGS AND WENT UP TO THE BOWL AND TOOK HOLD OF IT
1639-132848-0026 AND DESPAIR TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM TILL THE CLOSE OF DAY MANAWYDDAN WAITED FOR HIM AND WHEN THE SUN WAS FAST SINKING HE WENT HOME THINKING THAT HE HAD STRAYED FAR
1639-132848-0027 SHE ASKED LAYING HER HAND ON THE BOWL AND AS SHE SPOKE SHE TOO STUCK FAST AND WAS NOT ABLE TO UTTER A WORD THEN THUNDER WAS HEARD AND A VEIL OF DARKNESS DESCENDED UPON THEM
1639-132848-0028 SHE WAS IN SUCH SORROW THAT SHE CARED NOT WHETHER SHE LIVED OR DIED MANAWYDDAN WAS GRIEVED ALSO IN HIS HEART AND SAID TO HER IT IS NOT FITTING THAT WE SHOULD STAY HERE FOR HE HAVE LOST OUR DOGS AND CANNOT GET FOOD
1639-132848-0029 LET US GO INTO ENGLAND IT IS EASIER FOR US TO LIVE THERE SO THEY SET FORTH WHAT CRAFT WILT THOU FOLLOW ASKED KIEVA AS THEY WENT ALONG I SHALL MAKE SHOES AS ONCE I DID REPLIED HE
1639-132848-0030 AND HE AND KIEVA LEFT THE TOWN ONE NIGHT AND PROCEEDED TO NARBERTH TAKING WITH HIM A SHEAF OF WHEAT WHICH HE SOWED IN THREE PLOTS OF GROUND AND WHILE THE WHEAT WAS GROWING UP HE HUNTED AND FISHED AND THEY HAD FOOD ENOUGH AND TO SPARE

1639-132848-0034 EACH MOUSE CLIMBED UP A STRAW TILL IT BENT DOWN WITH ITS WEIGHT AND THEN IT BIT OFF ONE OF THE EARS AND CARRIED IT AWAY AND THERE WAS NOT ONE OF THE STRAWS THAT HAD NOT GOT A MOUSE TO IT
1639-132848-0035 FULL OF WRATH HE RUSHED AT THE MICE BUT HE COULD NO MORE COME UP WITH THEM THAN IF THEY HAD BEEN GNATS OR BIRDS OF THE AIR SAVE ONE ONLY WHICH LINGERED BEHIND THE REST AND THIS MOUSE MANAWYDDAN CAME UP WITH
