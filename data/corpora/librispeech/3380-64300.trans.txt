3380-64300-0000 NO SAID MISTER REDMAIN SHE MUST STAY WHERE SHE IS I FANCY SOMETHING HAPPENED LAST NIGHT WHICH SHE HAS GOT TO TELL US ABOUT AH WHAT WAS THAT ASKED MISTER BRETT FACING ROUND ON HER
3380-64300-0001 MARY BEGAN HER STORY WITH THE INCIDENT OF HER HAVING BEEN PURSUED BY SOME ONE AND RESCUED BY THE BLACKSMITH WHOM SHE TOLD HER LISTENERS SHE HAD KNOWN IN LONDON THEN SHE NARRATED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED THE NIGHT BEFORE FROM FIRST TO LAST
3380-64300-0002 NOT FORGETTING THE FLAME THAT LIGHTED THE CLOSET AS THEY APPROACHED THE WINDOW JUST LET ME SEE THOSE MEMORANDA SAID MISTER BRETT TO MISTER REDMAIN RISING AND LOOKING FOR THE PAPER WHERE HE HAD LEFT IT THE DAY BEFORE
3380-64300-0003 IT WAS OF THAT PAPER I WAS THIS MOMENT THINKING ANSWERED MISTER REDMAIN IT IS NOT HERE SAID MISTER BRETT I THOUGHT AS MUCH THE FOOL THERE WAS A THOUSAND POUNDS THERE FOR HER
3380-64300-0004 I DIDN'T WANT TO DRIVE HER TO DESPAIR A DYING MAN MUST MIND WHAT HE IS ABOUT RING THE BELL AND SEE WHAT MEWKS HAS TO SAY
3380-64300-0005 EVIDENT ANXIETY I WILL NOT RECORD HIS EXAMINATION MISTER BRETT TOOK IT FOR GRANTED HE HAD DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY SHUT OUT MARY AND MEWKS DID NOT ATTEMPT TO DENY IT PROTESTING HE BELIEVED SHE WAS BORING HIS MASTER
3380-64300-0006 MISTER BRETT NEXT REQUESTED THE PRESENCE OF MISS YOLLAND SHE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND THE PLACE WAS SEARCHED THROUGHOUT BUT THERE WAS NO TRACE OF HER WHEN THE DOCTOR ARRIVED
3380-64300-0007 HESPER SOUGHT MARY AND KISSED HER WITH SOME APPEARANCE OF GRATITUDE SHE SAW WHAT A HORRIBLE SUSPICION PERHAPS EVEN ACCUSATION SHE HAD SAVED HER FROM
3380-64300-0008 THE BEHAVIOR AND DISAPPEARANCE OF SEPIA SEEMED TO GIVE HER LITTLE TROUBLE
3380-64300-0009 ALMOST EVERY EVENING UNTIL HE LEFT DURNMELLING MARY WENT TO SEE MISTER REDMAIN SHE READ TO HIM AND TRIED TO TEACH HIM
3380-64300-0010 AND SOMETHING DID SEEM TO BE GETTING INTO OR WAKING UP IN HIM THE MAN HAD NEVER BEFORE IN THE LEAST SUBMITTED BUT NOW IT LOOKED AS IF THE WATCHING SPIRIT OF LIFE WERE FEELING THROUGH THE DUST HEAP OF HIS EVIL JUDGMENTS
3380-64300-0011 LOW THOUGHTS AND BAD LIFE TO FIND THE THING THAT SPIRIT HAD MADE
3380-64300-0012 WHEN THE TWO MET AND JOINED THEN WOULD THE MAN BE SAVED GOD AND HE WOULD BE TOGETHER SOMETIMES HE WOULD UTTER THE STRANGEST THINGS
3380-64300-0013 AND SOMETIMES FOR DAYS MARY WOULD NOT HAVE AN IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON IN HIM WHEN SUFFERING HE WOULD OCCASIONALLY BREAK INTO FIERCE AND EVIL LANGUAGE THEN BE SUDDENLY SILENT GOD AND SATAN WERE STRIVING FOR THE MAN
3380-64300-0014 AND HAVING NO REASON TO THINK HIS DEATH WOULD BE A GREAT GRIEF IN THE HOUSE DID NOT HESITATE MUCH TO EXPRESS HIS DOUBT AND INDEED IT CAUSED NO GLOOM FOR THERE WAS LITTLE LOVE IN THE ATTENTIONS THE MORTIMERS PAID HIM
3380-64300-0015 AND IN WHAT OTHER HOPE COULD HESPER HAVE MARRIED THAN THAT ONE DAY SHE WOULD BE FREE WITH A FREEDOM INFORMED WITH POWER THE POWER OF MONEY BUT TO THE MOTHER'S SUGGESTIONS AS TO POSSIBLE CHANGES IN THE FUTURE
3380-64300-0016 THE DAUGHTER NEVER RESPONDED SHE HAD NO THOUGHT OF PLANS IN COMMON WITH HER STRANGE RUMORS CAME ABROAD GODFREY WARDOUR HEARD SOMETHING OF THEM AND LAUGHED THEM TO SCORN
3380-64300-0017 AND AT LAST LOWERED HIS PRIDE SO FAR AS TO CALL ON MARY UNDER THE PRETENSE OF BUYING SOMETHING IN THE SHOP HIS TROUBLED LOOK FILLED HER WITH SYMPATHY BUT SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING GLAD AFRESH THAT HE HAD ESCAPED THE SNARES LAID FOR HIM
3380-64300-0018 HE LOOKED AT HER SEARCHINGLY AND AT LAST MURMURED A REQUEST THAT SHE WOULD ALLOW HIM TO HAVE A LITTLE CONVERSATION WITH HER SHE LED THE WAY TO HER PARLOR CLOSED THE DOOR AND ASKED HIM TO TAKE A SEAT
3380-64300-0019 MISTER WARDOUR SAID MARY IF I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BELIEVE WHAT I TOLD YON I WOULD WILLINGLY DO AS YOU ASK ME AS IT IS ALLOW ME TO REFER YOU TO MISTER BRETT THE LAWYER WHOM I DARE SAY YOU KNOW
3380-64300-0020 HAPPILY THE CHARACTER OF MISTER BRETT WAS WELL KNOWN IN TESTBRIDGE AND ALL THE COUNTRY ROUND AND FROM HIM GODFREY WARDOUR LEARNED WHAT SENT HIM TRAVELING ON THE CONTINENT AGAIN NOT IN THE HOPE OF FINDING SEPIA
3380-64300-0021 WHAT BECAME OF HER NONE OF HER FAMILY EVER LEARNED SOME TIME AFTER IT CAME OUT THAT THE SAME NIGHT ON WHICH THE PRESENCE OF JOSEPH RESCUED MARY FROM HER PURSUER A MAN SPEAKING WITH A FOREIGN ACCENT
3380-64300-0022 THAN SHE WROTE TO MARY INVITING HER TO GO AND VISIT HER BUT MARY ANSWERED SHE COULD NO MORE LEAVE HOME AND MUST CONTENT HERSELF WITH THE HOPE OF SEEING MISSUS REDMAIN WHEN SHE CAME TO DURNMELLING
3380-64300-0023 THE TIME FOR THAT DID NOT AGAIN ARRIVE BUT WHEN MARY WENT TO LONDON SHE ALWAYS CALLED ON HER AND GENERALLY SAW MISTER REDMAIN BUT THEY NEVER HAD ANY MORE TALK ABOUT THE THINGS MARY LOVED MOST
3380-64300-0024 WHETHER THE CHANGE WAS CAUSED BY SOMETHING BETTER THAN PHYSICAL DECAY WHO KNOWS SAVE HIM WHO CAN USE EVEN DECAY FOR REDEMPTION HE LIVED TWO YEARS MORE AND DIED RATHER SUDDENLY AFTER HIS DEATH
3380-64300-0025 AND THAT OF HER FATHER WHICH FOLLOWED SOON HESPER WENT AGAIN TO DURNMELLING AND BEHAVED BETTER TO HER MOTHER THAN BEFORE MARY SOMETIMES SAW HER AND A FLICKER OF GENUINE FRIENDSHIP BEGAN TO APPEAR ON HESPER'S PART MISTER TURNBULL
3380-64300-0026 WAS SOON DRIVING WHAT HE CALLED A ROARING TRADE HE BOUGHT AND SOLD A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN MARY BUT SHE HAD BUSINESS SUFFICIENT TO EMPLOY HER DAYS AND LEAVE HER NIGHTS FREE AND BRING HER AND LETTY ENOUGH TO LIVE ON AS COMFORTABLY AS THEY DESIRED
3380-64300-0027 TO USE WHEN OCCASION WAS FOR OTHERS AND SOMETHING TO LAY BY FOR THE TIME OF LENGTHENING SHADOWS TURNBULL SEEMED TO HARE TAKEN A LESSON FROM HIS LATE NARROW ESCAPE FOR HE GAVE UP THE WORST OF HIS SPECULATIONS
3380-64300-0028 AND CONFINED HIMSELF TO GENUINE BUSINESS PRINCIPLES THE MORE CONTENTEDLY THAT ALL MARSTON FOLLY SWEPT FROM HIS PATH HE WAS FREE TO HIS OWN INTERPRETATION OF THE PHRASE HE GREW A RICH MAN AND DIED HAPPY
3380-64300-0029 SO HIS FRIENDS SAID AND SAID AS THEY SAW MISSUS TURNBULL LEFT TESTBRIDGE
3380-64300-0030 THERE SHE WAS REGARDED AS THE WIDOW OF AN OFFICER IN HER MAJESTY'S SERVICE AND
3380-64300-0031 SHE DID NOT THINK IT WORTH HER WHILE TO MAKE ONE WAS NOT THE SUPPOSED BREVET A TRUER INDEX TO HER CONSCIOUSNESS OF HERSELF THAN THE ACTUAL TICKET BY ILL LUCK ATTACHED TO HER WIDOW OF A LINEN DRAPER
3380-64300-0032 GEORGE CARRIED ON THE BUSINESS AND WHEN MARY AND HE HAPPENED TO PASS IN THE STREET THEY NODDED TO EACH OTHER LETTY WAS DILIGENT IN BUSINESS BUT IT NEVER GOT INTO HER HEART SHE CONTINUED TO BE MUCH LIKED
3380-64300-0033 AND IN THE SHOP WAS DELIGHTFUL IF SHE EVER HAD ANOTHER OFFER OF MARRIAGE THE FACT REMAINED UNKNOWN SHE LIVED TO BE A SWEET GRACIOUS LITTLE OLD LADY AND OFTEN FORGOT THAT SHE WAS A WIDOW BUT NEVER THAT SHE WAS A WIFE
3380-64300-0034 ALL THE DAYS OF HER APPOINTED TIME SHE WAITED TILL HER CHANGE SHOULD COME
3380-64300-0035 LOOKING OUT FOR HER AS HE HAD SAID HE WOULD HER MOTHER IN LAW COULD NOT HELP DYING BUT SHE NEVER FORGAVE HER FOR WHAT NOBODY KNEW AFTER A YEAR OR SO MISSUS WARDOUR BEGAN TO TAKE A LITTLE NOTICE OF HER AGAIN
3380-64300-0036 OLD MISTER DUPPA DIED AND A YOUNG MAN CAME TO MINISTER TO HIS CONGREGATION WHO THOUGHT THE BAPTISM OF THE SPIRIT OF MORE IMPORTANCE THAN THE MOST CORRECT OF OPINIONS CONCERNING EVEN THE BAPTIZING SPIRIT
3380-64300-0037 FROM HIM MARY FOUND SHE COULD LEARN AND WOULD BE MUCH TO BLAME IF SHE DID NOT LEARN FROM HIM LETTY ALSO HEARD WHAT INCREASED HER DESIRE TO BE WORTH SOMETHING BEFORE SHE WENT TO REJOIN TOM
3380-64300-0038 JOSEPH JASPER BECAME ONCE MORE MARY'S PUPIL SHE WAS NOW NO MORE CONTENT WITH HER LITTLE COTTAGE PIANO BUT HAD AN INSTRUMENT OF QUITE ANOTHER CAPACITY ON WHICH TO ACCOMPANY THE VIOLIN OF THE BLACKSMITH
3380-64300-0039 TO HIM TRADE CAME IN STEADILY AND BEFORE LONG HE HAD TO BUILD A LARGER SHOEING SHED FROM A WIDE NEIGHBORHOOD HORSES WERE BROUGHT HIM TO BE SHOD CART WHEELS TO BE TIRED AXLES TO BE MENDED PLOWSHARES TO BE SHARPENED
3380-64300-0040 AND ALL SORTS OF ODD JOBS TO BE DONE HE SOON FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE ARRANGEMENT WITH A CARPENTER AND WHEELWRIGHT TO WORK ON HIS PREMISES BEFORE TWO YEARS WERE OVER HE WAS WHAT PEOPLE CALL A FLOURISHING MAN AND LAYING BY A LITTLE MONEY
