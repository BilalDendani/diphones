5725-48803-0000 OFFERS OF HOSPITALITY HAD BEEN MADE TO HIM BY THE DOZEN LADY HARTLETOP'S DOORS IN SHROPSHIRE WERE OPEN TO HIM IF HE CHOSE TO ENTER THEM
5725-48803-0001 TO JOIN HER SUITE AT COURCY CASTLE HIS SPECIAL FRIEND MONTGOMERIE DOBBS HAD A PLACE IN SCOTLAND AND THEN THERE WAS A YACHTING PARTY BY WHICH HE WAS MUCH WANTED
5725-48803-0002 HAVING BEFORE HIM WHEN HE LEFT LONDON NO OTHER FIXED ENGAGEMENT THAN THAT WHICH TOOK HIM TO ALLINGTON ON THE FIRST OF OCTOBER WE SHALL ALSO FIND OURSELVES AT ALLINGTON IN COMPANY WITH JOHNNY EAMES AND APOLLO CROSBIE WILL STILL BE THERE
5725-48803-0003 BY NO MEANS TO THE COMFORT OF OUR FRIEND FROM THE INCOME TAX OFFICE JOHNNY EAMES CANNOT BE CALLED UNLUCKY IN THAT MATTER OF HIS ANNUAL HOLIDAY SEEING THAT HE WAS ALLOWED TO LEAVE LONDON IN OCTOBER A MONTH DURING WHICH FEW CHOSE TO OWN THAT THEY REMAIN IN TOWN
5725-48803-0004 YOUNG EAMES THOUGH HE LIVED IN BURTON CRESCENT AND HAD AS YET NO CONNECTION WITH THE WEST END HAD ALREADY LEARNED HIS LESSON IN THIS RESPECT THOSE FELLOWS IN THE BIG ROOM WANT ME TO TAKE MAY HE HAD SAID TO HIS FRIEND CRADELL THEY MUST THINK I'M UNCOMMON GREEN
5725-48803-0005 IT'S TOO BAD SAID CRADELL A MAN SHOULDN'T BE ASKED TO TAKE HIS LEAVE IN MAY I NEVER DID AND WHAT'S MORE I NEVER WILL I'D GO TO THE BOARD FIRST EAMES HAD ESCAPED THIS EVIL WITHOUT GOING TO THE BOARD AND HAD SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING FOR HIMSELF
5725-48803-0006 WHICH OF ALL MONTHS IS PERHAPS THE MOST HIGHLY ESTEEMED FOR HOLIDAY PURPOSES
5725-48803-0007 ON THE EVENING BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE AT THAT MOMENT HE WAS SITTING ALONE WITH AMELIA IN MISSUS ROPER'S BACK DRAWING ROOM IN THE FRONT ROOM CRADELL WAS TALKING TO MISSUS LUPEX BUT AS MISS SPRUCE WAS WITH THEM
5725-48803-0008 IT MAY BE PRESUMED THAT MISTER LUPEX NEED HAVE HAD NO CAUSE FOR JEALOUSY YES SAID AMELIA I KNOW HOW GREAT IS YOUR HASTE TO GET DOWN TO THAT FASCINATING SPOT
5725-48803-0009 NOT HANDSOME FOR HER NOSE WAS THICK AND THE LOWER PART OF HER FACE WAS HEAVY BUT YET NOT WITHOUT SOME FEMININE ATTRACTIONS HER EYES WERE BRIGHT BUT THEN ALSO THEY WERE MISCHIEVOUS SHE COULD TALK FLUENTLY ENOUGH BUT THEN ALSO SHE COULD SCOLD
5725-48803-0010 I AM QUITE PREPARED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT JOHN EAMES SHOULD HAVE KEPT HIMSELF CLEAR OF AMELIA ROPER BUT THEN YOUNG MEN SO FREQUENTLY DO THOSE THINGS WHICH THEY SHOULD NOT DO AFTER TWELVE MONTHS UP HERE IN LONDON ONE IS GLAD TO GET AWAY TO ONE'S OWN FRIENDS
5725-48803-0011 SAID JOHNNY YOUR OWN FRIENDS MISTER EAMES WHAT SORT OF FRIENDS DO YOU SUPPOSE I DON'T KNOW WELL NO I DON'T THINK YOU DO KNOW
5725-48803-0012 SAID AMELIA SHOWING THAT LILY HAD BEEN SPOKEN OF AMONG PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO HEAR HER NAME BUT PERHAPS AFTER ALL NO MORE THAN THOSE TWO INITIALS WERE KNOWN IN BURTON CRESCENT FROM THE TONE WHICH WAS NOW USED IN NAMING THEM
5725-48803-0013 IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY MANIFEST THAT AMELIA CONSIDERED HERSELF TO BE WRONGED BY THEIR VERY EXISTENCE L S D SAID JOHNNY ATTEMPTING THE LINE OF A WITTY GAY YOUNG SPENDTHRIFT THAT'S MY LOVE
5725-48803-0014 POUNDS SHILLINGS AND PENCE AND A VERY COY MISTRESS SHE IS NONSENSE SIR DON'T TALK TO ME IN THAT WAY AS IF I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE YOUR HEART WAS WHAT RIGHT HAD YOU TO SPEAK TO ME IF YOU HAD AN L D DOWN IN THE COUNTRY
5725-48803-0015 BUT THEN HE HAD WRITTEN TO HER A FATAL NOTE OF WHICH WE WILL SPEAK FURTHER BEFORE LONG AND THAT PERHAPS WAS QUITE AS BAD OR WORSE HA HA HA LAUGHED JOHNNY BUT THE LAUGH WAS ASSUMED AND NOT ASSUMED WITH EASE
5725-48803-0016 YES SIR IT'S A LAUGHING MATTER TO YOU I DARE SAY IT IS VERY EASY FOR A MAN TO LAUGH UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IS TO SAY IF HE IS PERFECTLY HEARTLESS IF HE'S GOT A STONE INSIDE HIS BOSOM INSTEAD OF FLESH AND BLOOD
5725-48803-0017 SOME MEN ARE MADE OF STONE I KNOW AND ARE TROUBLED WITH NO FEELINGS WHAT IS IT YOU WANT ME TO SAY YOU PRETEND TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT AND IT WOULDN'T BE CIVIL IN ME TO CONTRADICT YOU
5725-48803-0018 WHAT IS IT I WANT YOU KNOW VERY WELL WHAT I WANT OR RATHER I DON'T WANT ANYTHING WHAT IS IT TO ME IT IS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT L D YOU CAN GO DOWN TO ALLINGTON AND DO WHAT YOU LIKE FOR ME ONLY
5725-48803-0019 I HATE SUCH WAYS WHAT WAYS AMELIA WHAT WAYS NOW LOOK HERE JOHNNY I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE A FOOL OF MYSELF FOR ANY MAN WHEN I CAME HOME HERE THREE MONTHS AGO AND I WISH I NEVER HAD
5725-48803-0020 SHE PAUSED HERE A MOMENT WAITING FOR A WORD OF TENDERNESS BUT AS THE WORD OF TENDERNESS DID NOT COME SHE WENT ON
5725-48803-0021 AND THEN SHE BROUGHT OUT HER HANDKERCHIEF WHAT AM I TO SAY WHEN YOU KEEP ON SCOLDING ME ALL THE TIME SCOLDING YOU
5725-48803-0022 IF IT'S TO BE ALL OVER BETWEEN US SAY THE WORD AND I'LL TAKE MYSELF AWAY OUT OF THE HOUSE BEFORE YOU COME BACK AGAIN I'VE HAD NO SECRETS FROM YOU
5725-48803-0023 THOUGH IT IS BENEATH MY BIRTH AND NOT WHAT I'VE BEEN USED TO
5725-48803-0024 ONLY SAY THE WORD L D WAS MORE TO HIM THAN AMELIA ROPER TEN TIMES MORE TO HIM L D WOULD HAVE BEEN EVERYTHING TO HIM AND AMELIA ROPER WAS WORSE THAN NOTHING HE FELT ALL THIS AT THE MOMENT
5725-48803-0025 AND STRUGGLED HARD TO COLLECT AN AMOUNT OF COURAGE THAT WOULD MAKE HIM FREE SAY THE WORD SAID SHE RISING ON HER FEET BEFORE HIM AND ALL BETWEEN YOU AND ME SHALL BE OVER I HAVE GOT YOUR PROMISE BUT I'D SCORN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
5725-48803-0026 IF AMELIA HASN'T GOT YOUR HEART SHE'D DESPISE TO TAKE YOUR HAND ONLY I MUST HAVE AN ANSWER IT WOULD SEEM THAT AN EASY WAY OF ESCAPE WAS OFFERED TO HIM
5725-48803-0027 AND THEN UPON HEARING THESE WORDS AMELIA THREW HERSELF INTO HIS ARMS AS THE FOLDING DOORS BETWEEN THE TWO ROOMS WERE NOT CLOSED
5725-48803-0028 IT WAS PROBABLE THAT SHE SAW WHAT PASSED BUT MISS SPRUCE WAS A TACITURN OLD LADY
5725-48803-0029 AND AS SHE HAD LIVED WITH MISSUS ROPER FOR THE LAST TWELVE YEARS SHE WAS PROBABLY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HER DAUGHTER'S WAYS YOU'LL BE TRUE TO ME SAID AMELIA DURING THE MOMENT OF THAT EMBRACE TRUE TO ME FOR EVER
5725-48803-0030 OH YES THAT'S A MATTER OF COURSE SAID JOHNNY EAMES AND THEN SHE LIBERATED HIM AND THE TWO STROLLED INTO THE FRONT SITTING ROOM I DECLARE MISTER EAMES SAID MISSUS LUPEX I'M GLAD YOU'VE COME
5725-48803-0031 HERE'S MISTER CRADELL DOES SAY SUCH QUEER THINGS QUEER THINGS SAID CRADELL NOW MISS SPRUCE I APPEAL TO YOU HAVE I SAID ANY QUEER THINGS IF YOU DID SIR I DIDN'T NOTICE THEM SAID MISS SPRUCE
5725-48803-0032 I NOTICED THEM THEN SAID MISSUS LUPEX AN UNMARRIED MAN LIKE MISTER CRADELL HAS NO BUSINESS TO KNOW WHETHER A MARRIED LADY WEARS A CAP OR HER OWN HAIR HAS HE MISTER EAMES I DON'T THINK I EVER KNOW
5725-48803-0033 SAID JOHNNY NOT INTENDING ANY SARCASM ON MISSUS LUPEX I DARE SAY NOT SIR SAID THE LADY WE ALL KNOW WHERE YOUR ATTENTION IS RIVETED
5725-48803-0034 WOULDN'T THEY MISS SPRUCE I DARE SAY THEY WOULD SAID MISS SPRUCE IF I COULD LOOK AS NICE IN A CAP AS YOU DO MISSUS LUPEX I'D WEAR ONE TO MORROW SAID AMELIA WHO DID NOT WISH TO QUARREL WITH THE MARRIED LADY AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
5725-48803-0035 DOES LUPEX LIKE CAPS
5725-48803-0036 NOR YET IF I HAD GOT NO HEAD AT ALL THAT'S WHAT COMES OF GETTING MARRIED IF YOU'LL TAKE MY ADVICE MISS ROPER YOU'LL STAY AS YOU ARE EVEN THOUGH SOMEBODY SHOULD BREAK HIS HEART ABOUT IT WOULDN'T YOU MISS SPRUCE
5725-48803-0037 OH AS FOR ME I'M AN OLD WOMAN YOU KNOW SAID MISS SPRUCE WHICH WAS CERTAINLY TRUE I DON'T SEE WHAT ANY WOMAN GETS BY MARRYING CONTINUED MISSUS LUPEX BUT A MAN GAINS EVERYTHING
5725-48803-0038 HE DON'T KNOW HOW TO LIVE UNLESS HE'S GOT A WOMAN TO HELP HIM BUT IS LOVE TO GO FOR NOTHING SAID CRADELL OH LOVE I DON'T BELIEVE IN LOVE
5725-48803-0039 I WAS BORN SO SAID JOHNNY AND THERE'S MISS ROPER ONE NEVER OUGHT TO SPEAK FREE ABOUT A LADY BUT PERHAPS SHE'S IN LOVE TOO SPEAK FOR YOURSELF MISSUS LUPEX SAID AMELIA THERE'S NO HARM IN SAYING THAT IS THERE
5725-48803-0040 I'M SURE IF YOU AIN'T YOU'RE VERY HARD HEARTED FOR IF EVER THERE WAS A TRUE LOVER I BELIEVE YOU'VE GOT ONE OF YOUR OWN MY IF THERE'S NOT LUPEX'S STEP ON THE STAIR WHAT CAN BRING HIM HOME AT THIS HOUR IF HE'S BEEN DRINKING HE'LL COME HOME AS CROSS AS ANYTHING
5725-48803-0041 THEN MISTER LUPEX ENTERED THE ROOM AND THE PLEASANTNESS OF THE PARTY WAS DESTROYED IT MAY BE SAID THAT NEITHER MISSUS CRADELL NOR MISSUS EAMES WOULD HAVE PLACED THEIR SONS IN BURTON CRESCENT IF THEY HAD KNOWN THE DANGERS INTO WHICH THE YOUNG MEN WOULD FALL
5725-48803-0042 BY GEORGE JOHNNY YOU'LL GET YOURSELF ENTANGLED WITH THAT GIRL ONE ALWAYS HAS TO GO THROUGH THAT SORT OF THING SAID JOHNNY YES BUT THOSE WHO GO THROUGH TOO MUCH OF IT NEVER GET OUT AGAIN
5725-48803-0043 WHERE WOULD YOU BE IF SHE GOT A WRITTEN PROMISE OF MARRIAGE FROM YOU POOR JOHNNY DID NOT ANSWER THIS IMMEDIATELY FOR IN VERY TRUTH AMELIA ROPER HAD SUCH A DOCUMENT IN HER POSSESSION
5725-48803-0044 EITHER THAT OR ELSE AMONG THE VICTIMS OF MATRIMONY
5725-48803-0045 IT'S A MATTER OF DOUBT WHAT A MAN OUGHT TO DO IN SUCH A CASE BUT THERE'S BEEN NOTHING OF THAT KIND YET OH DEAR NO
5725-48803-0046 WHERE WOULD YOU BE NOW WITH SUCH A GIRL AS THAT FOR YOUR WIFE SUCH HAD BEEN THE CAUTION GIVEN BY CRADELL TO HIS FRIEND AND NOW JUST AS HE WAS STARTING FOR ALLINGTON EAMES RETURNED THE COMPLIMENT
5725-48803-0047 THEY HAD GONE TOGETHER TO THE GREAT WESTERN STATION AT PADDINGTON AND JOHNNY TENDERED HIS ADVICE AS THEY WERE WALKING TOGETHER UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM
5725-48803-0048 BUT I SHALL TAKE CARE OF MYSELF THERE'S NOTHING SO SAFE AS A LITTLE NONSENSE WITH A MARRIED WOMAN OF COURSE IT MEANS NOTHING YOU KNOW BETWEEN HER AND ME I DON'T SUPPOSE IT DOES MEAN ANYTHING
5725-48803-0049 BUT SHE'S ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT LUPEX BEING JEALOUS AND IF HE WAS TO CUT UP ROUGH YOU WOULDN'T FIND IT PLEASANT CRADELL HOWEVER SEEMED TO THINK THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER HIS LITTLE AFFAIR WITH MISSUS LUPEX WAS QUITE PLATONIC AND SAFE
5725-48803-0050 AS FOR DOING ANY REAL HARM HIS PRINCIPLES AS HE ASSURED HIS FRIEND WERE TOO HIGH MISSUS LUPEX WAS A WOMAN OF TALENT WHOM NO ONE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND
5725-48803-0051 IT WAS MERELY A STUDY OF CHARACTER AND NOTHING MORE THEN THE FRIENDS PARTED AND EAMES WAS CARRIED AWAY BY THE NIGHT MAIL TRAIN DOWN TO GUESTWICK
5725-48803-0052 HOW HER MATERNAL HEART WAS REJOICING AT SEEING THE IMPROVEMENT IN HIS GAIT AND THE MANLINESS OF APPEARANCE IMPARTED TO HIM BY HIS WHISKERS I NEED NOT DESCRIBE AT LENGTH MANY OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF A HOBBLEDEHOY HAD FALLEN FROM HIM
5725-48803-0053 AND EVEN LILY DALE MIGHT NOW PROBABLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE WAS NO LONGER A BOY ALL WHICH MIGHT BE REGARDED AS GOOD IF ONLY IN PUTTING OFF CHILDISH THINGS HE HAD TAKEN UP THINGS WHICH WERE BETTER THAN CHILDISH ON THE VERY FIRST DAY OF HIS ARRIVAL
5725-48803-0054 HE MADE HIS WAY OVER TO ALLINGTON HE DID NOT WALK ON THIS OCCASION AS HE HAD USED TO DO IN THE OLD HAPPY DAYS
5725-48803-0055 AND THE HEAT OF THE DAY ON HIS BROW SO HE BORROWED A HORSE AND RODE OVER TAKING SOME PRIDE IN A PAIR OF SPURS WHICH HE HAD BOUGHT IN PICCADILLY AND IN HIS KID GLOVES WHICH WERE BROUGHT OUT NEW FOR THE OCCASION ALAS ALAS
5725-48803-0056 I FEAR THAT THOSE TWO YEARS IN LONDON HAVE NOT IMPROVED JOHN EAMES AND YET I HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT JOHN EAMES IS ONE OF THE HEROES OF MY STORY ON ENTERING MISSUS DALE'S DRAWING ROOM HE FOUND MISSUS DALE AND HER ELDEST DAUGHTER
5725-48803-0057 LILY AT THE MOMENT WAS NOT THERE AND AS HE SHOOK HANDS WITH THE OTHER TWO OF COURSE HE ASKED FOR HER SHE IS ONLY IN THE GARDEN SAID BELL SHE WILL BE HERE DIRECTLY SHE HAS WALKED ACROSS TO THE GREAT HOUSE WITH MISTER CROSBIE SAID MISSUS DALE
5725-48803-0058 BUT SHE IS NOT GOING TO REMAIN SHE WILL BE SO GLAD TO SEE YOU JOHN WE ALL EXPECTED YOU TO DAY DID YOU SAID JOHNNY WHOSE HEART HAD BEEN PLUNGED INTO COLD WATER AT THE MENTION OF MISTER CROSBIE'S NAME
5725-48803-0059 HE HAD BEEN THINKING OF LILIAN DALE EVER SINCE HIS FRIEND HAD LEFT HIM ON THE RAILWAY PLATFORM AND AS I BEG TO ASSURE ALL LADIES WHO MAY READ MY TALE THE TRUTH OF HIS LOVE FOR LILY
5725-48803-0060 I FEAR THAT I SHALL BE DISBELIEVED IN THIS BUT IT WAS SO HIS HEART WAS AND EVER HAD BEEN TRUE TO LILIAN ALTHOUGH HE HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE TALKED INTO DECLARATIONS OF AFFECTION BY SUCH A CREATURE AS AMELIA ROPER
5725-48803-0061 AND NOW HE HEARD THAT SHE WAS WALKING ALONE ABOUT THE GARDENS WITH A STRANGE GENTLEMAN THAT MISTER CROSBIE WAS VERY GRAND AND VERY FASHIONABLE HE HAD HEARD BUT HE KNEW NO MORE OF HIM WHY SHOULD MISTER CROSBIE BE ALLOWED TO WALK WITH LILY DALE AND WHY SHOULD MISSUS DALE MENTION THE CIRCUMSTANCE
5725-48803-0062 SUCH MYSTERY AS THERE WAS IN THIS WAS SOLVED VERY QUICKLY
5725-48803-0063 SHE IS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO MISTER CROSBIE THE WATER INTO WHICH JOHNNY'S HEART HAD BEEN PLUNGED NOW CLOSED OVER HIS HEAD AND LEFT HIM SPEECHLESS
5725-48803-0064 THAT SECRET WHICH IT WOULD NOW BEHOVE HIM TO CONCEAL FROM ALL THE WORLD BUT YET HE COULD NOT SPEAK
5725-48803-0065 HE WON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT ME SAID JOHNNY AND EVEN IN SPEAKING THESE FEW SENSELESS WORDS WORDS WHICH HE UTTERED BECAUSE IT WAS NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD SAY SOMETHING THE TONE OF HIS VOICE WAS ALTERED
5725-48803-0066 THERE IS LILY COMING ACROSS THE LAWN SAID MISSUS DALE THEN I'D BETTER GO SAID EAMES DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT PRAY DON'T
