2110-161101-0000 FIFTY EIGHT HERR STEIN SEES AND HEARS THAT I AM MORE OF A PLAYER THAN BEECKE THAT WITHOUT MAKING GRIMACES OF ANY KIND I PLAY SO EXPRESSIVELY THAT ACCORDING TO HIS OWN CONFESSION
2110-161101-0001 NO ONE SHOWS OFF HIS PIANOFORTE AS WELL AS I THAT I ALWAYS REMAIN STRICTLY IN TIME SURPRISES EVERY ONE THEY CAN NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE LEFT HAND SHOULD NOT IN THE LEAST BE CONCERNED IN A TEMPO RUBATO
2110-161101-0002 WHEN THEY PLAY THE LEFT HAND ALWAYS FOLLOWS AUGSBURG
2110-161101-0003 SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN TO HIS FATHER WE HAVE HERE A SUGGESTION OF THE TEMPO RUBATO AS PLAYED BY CHOPIN ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF MIKULI
2110-161101-0004 WHO SAID THAT NO MATTER HOW FREE CHOPIN WAS EITHER IN MELODY OR ARABESQUE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND THE LEFT ALWAYS ADHERED STRICTLY TO THE TIME MOZART LEARNED THE PRINCIPLE FROM HIS FATHER
2110-161101-0005 WHO IN HIS METHOD FOR THE VIOLIN CONDEMNED THE ACCOMPANISTS WHO SPOILED THE TEMPO RUBATO OF AN ARTIST BY WAITING TO FOLLOW HIM H E K FIFTY NINE
2110-161101-0006 WHOEVER CAN SEE AND HEAR HER THE DAUGHTER OF STEIN PLAY WITHOUT LAUGHING MUST BE A STONE STEIN LIKE HER FATHER SHE SITS OPPOSITE THE TREBLE INSTEAD OF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INSTRUMENT
2110-161101-0007 SO THAT THERE MAY BE GREATER OPPORTUNITIES FOR SWAYING ABOUT AND MAKING GRIMACES THEN SHE ROLLS UP HER EYES AND SMIRKS IF A PASSAGE OCCURS TWICE IT IS PLAYED SLOWER THE SECOND TIME
2110-161101-0008 IF THREE TIMES STILL SLOWER WHEN A PASSAGE COMES UP GOES THE ARM AND IF THERE IS TO BE AN EMPHASIS IT MUST COME FROM THE ARM HEAVILY AND CLUMSILY NOT FROM THE FINGERS
2110-161101-0009 BUT THE BEST OF ALL IS THAT WHEN THERE COMES A PASSAGE WHICH OUGHT TO FLOW LIKE OIL IN WHICH THERE NECESSARILY OCCURS A CHANGE OF FINGERS THERE IS NO NEED OF TAKING CARE WHEN THE TIME COMES YOU STOP
2110-161101-0010 LIFT THE HAND AND NONCHALANTLY BEGIN AGAIN THIS HELPS ONE THE BETTER TO CATCH A FALSE NOTE AND THE EFFECT IS FREQUENTLY CURIOUS AUGSBURG
2110-161101-0011 SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THE LETTER IS TO HIS FATHER AND THE YOUNG WOMAN WHOSE PLAYING IS CRITICIZED IS THE LITTLE MISS OF EIGHT YEARS NANETTE STEIN SIXTY
2110-161101-0012 WHEN I TOLD HERR STEIN THAT I WOULD LIKE TO PLAY ON HIS ORGAN AND THAT I WAS PASSIONATELY FOND OF THE INSTRUMENT HE MARVELED GREATLY AND SAID WHAT A MAN LIKE YOU SO GREAT A CLAVIER PLAYER
2110-161101-0013 NO EXPRESSION NEITHER PIANO NOR FORTE BUT GOES ON ALWAYS THE SAME BUT ALL THAT SIGNIFIES NOTHING TO ME THE ORGAN IS NEVERTHELESS THE KING OF INSTRUMENTS AUGSBURG OCTOBER SEVENTEENTH
2110-161101-0014 SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN TO HIS FATHER SIXTY ONE I HAD THE PLEASURE TO HEAR HERR FRANZL WHOSE WIFE IS A SISTER OF MADAME CANNABICH PLAY A CONCERTO ON THE VIOLIN
2110-161101-0015 HE PLEASES ME GREATLY YOU KNOW THAT I AM NO GREAT LOVER OF DIFFICULTIES HE PLAYS DIFFICULT THINGS BUT ONE DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THAT THEY ARE DIFFICULT BUT IMAGINES THAT ONE
2110-161101-0016 COULD DO THE SAME THING AT ONCE THAT IS TRUE ART HE ALSO HAS A BEAUTIFUL ROUND TONE NOT A NOTE IS MISSING ONE HEARS EVERYTHING EVERYTHING IS WELL MARKED HE HAS A FINE STACCATO BOW
2110-161101-0017 UP AS WELL AS DOWN AND I HAVE NEVER HEARD SO GOOD A DOUBLE SHAKE AS HIS IN A WORD THOUGH HE IS NO WIZARD HE IS A SOLID VIOLINIST
2110-161101-0018 SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN TO HIS FATHER SIXTY TWO WHEREIN CONSISTS THE ART OF PLAYING PRIMA VISTA IN THIS TO PLAY IN THE PROPER TEMPO
2110-161101-0019 JANUARY SEVENTEENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO HIS FATHER
2110-161101-0020 I AM AT HERR VON AURNHAMMER'S AFTER DINNER NEARLY EVERY DAY THE YOUNG WOMAN IS A FRIGHT BUT SHE PLAYS RAVISHINGLY
2110-161101-0021 SHE IS TOO JERKY VIENNA JUNE TWENTY SEVENTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY ONE TO HIS FATHER BEETHOVEN FOUND THE SAME FAULT WITH MOZART'S PLAYING THAT MOZART HERE CONDEMNS
2110-161101-0022 SIXTY FOUR HERR RICHTER PLAYS MUCH AND WELL SO FAR AS EXECUTION IS CONCERNED BUT AS YOU WILL HEAR CRUDELY LABORIOUSLY AND WITHOUT TASTE OR FEELING
2110-161101-0023 HE IS ONE OF THE BEST FELLOWS IN THE WORLD AND WITHOUT A PARTICLE OF VANITY WHENEVER I PLAYED FOR HIM HE LOOKED IMMOVABLY AT MY FINGERS AND ONE DAY HE SAID MY GOD
2110-161101-0024 HOW I AM OBLIGED TO TORMENT MYSELF AND SWEAT AND YET WITHOUT OBTAINING APPLAUSE AND FOR YOU MY FRIEND IT IS MERE PLAY YES SAID I I HAD TO LABOR ONCE IN ORDER NOT TO SHOW LABOR NOW
2110-161101-0025 VIENNA APRIL TWENTY EIGHTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR TO HIS FATHER IN SALZBURG WHITHER THE PIANIST RICHTER WHOM HE RECOMMENDS TO HIS FATHER IS GOING ON A CONCERT TRIP
2110-161101-0026 SIXTY FIVE MEISSNER AS YOU KNOW HAS THE BAD HABIT OF PURPOSELY MAKING HIS VOICE TREMBLE MARKING THUS ENTIRE QUARTER AND EIGHTH NOTES I NEVER COULD ENDURE IT IN HIM
2110-161101-0027 IT IS INDEED DESPICABLE AND CONTRARY TO ALL NATURALNESS IN SONG TRUE THE HUMAN VOICE TREMBLES OF ITSELF BUT ONLY IN A DEGREE THAT REMAINS BEAUTIFUL IT IS IN THE NATURE OF THE VOICE
2110-161101-0028 BUT AS SOON AS YOU OVERSTEP THE LIMIT IT IS NO LONGER BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE IT IS CONTRARY TO NATURE PARIS JUNE TWELFTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO HIS FATHER
2110-161101-0029 THE STATEMENT THAT THE TREMOLO EFFECT COULD BE IMITATED ON THE CLAVIER SEEMS TO REQUIRE AN EXPLANATION MOZART OBVIOUSLY HAD IN VIEW NOT THE PIANOFORTE WHICH WAS JUST COMING INTO USE IN HIS DAY
2110-161101-0030 BUT THE CLAVICHORD THIS INSTRUMENT WAS SOUNDED BY STRIKING THE STRINGS WITH BITS OF BRASS PLACED IN THE FARTHER END OF THE KEYS
2110-161101-0031 THE TANGENTS AS THEY WERE CALLED HAD TO BE HELD AGAINST THE STRINGS AS LONG AS IT WAS DESIRED THAT THE TONE SHOULD SOUND AND BY GENTLY REPEATING THE PRESSURE ON THE KEY
2110-161101-0032 A TREMULOUSNESS WAS IMPARTED TO THE TONE WHICH MADE THE CLAVICHORD A MORE EXPRESSIVE INSTRUMENT THAN THE HARPSICHORD OR THE EARLY PIANOFORTE
2110-161101-0033 AND BALANCEMENT IN FRENCH H E K SIXTY SIX BEFORE DINNER HERR VOGLER DASHED THROUGH MY SONATA PRIMA VISTA HE PLAYED THE FIRST MOVEMENT
2110-161101-0034 WITH A VENGEANCE AS A RULE HE PLAYED A DIFFERENT BASS THAN THE ONE I HAD WRITTEN AND OCCASIONALLY HE CHANGED THE HARMONY AS WELL AS THE MELODY
2110-161101-0035 THE EYES CAN NOT FOLLOW NOR THE HANDS GRASP THE MUSIC SUCH PLAYING AT SIGHT AND ARE ALL ONE TO ME THE HEARERS I MEAN THOSE WORTHY OF THE NAME CAN SAY NOTHING MORE
2110-161101-0036 YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT IT WAS ALL THE MORE UNENDURABLE BECAUSE I DID NOT DARE TO SAY TO HIM MUCH TOO QUICK MOREOVER IT IS MUCH EASIER TO PLAY RAPIDLY THAN SLOWLY YOU CAN DROP A FEW NOTES IN PASSAGES WITHOUT ANY ONE NOTICING IT
2110-161101-0037 BUT IS IT BEAUTIFUL AT SUCH SPEED YOU CAN USE THE HANDS INDISCRIMINATELY BUT IS THAT BEAUTIFUL MANNHEIM JANUARY SEVENTEENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO HIS FATHER
2110-161101-0038 SIXTY SEVEN
2110-161101-0039 TRILL OR PILE ON THE ADORNMENTS BECAUSE THEY CAN NEITHER STUDY NOR SUSTAIN A TONE
2110-161101-0040 AH IF THERE IS NO FIRE IN THE COMPOSITION YOU WILL SURELY NEVER GET IT IN BY HURRYING IT
