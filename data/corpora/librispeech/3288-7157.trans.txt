3288-7157-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT MARILLA WALKING HOME ONE LATE APRIL EVENING FROM AN AID MEETING REALIZED THAT THE WINTER WAS OVER
3288-7157-0001 SHE PROBABLY IMAGINED THAT SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT THE AIDS AND THEIR MISSIONARY BOX AND THE NEW CARPET FOR THE VESTRY ROOM BUT UNDER THESE REFLECTIONS WAS A HARMONIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS OF RED FIELDS
3288-7157-0002 SMOKING INTO PALE PURPLY MISTS IN THE DECLINING SUN OF LONG SHARP POINTED FIR SHADOWS FALLING OVER THE MEADOW BEYOND THE BROOK OF STILL CRIMSON BUDDED MAPLES AROUND A MIRRORLIKE WOOD POOL
3288-7157-0003 OF A WAKENING IN THE WORLD AND A STIR OF HIDDEN PULSES UNDER THE GRAY SOD THE SPRING WAS ABROAD IN THE LAND AND MARILLA'S SOBER MIDDLE AGED STEP WAS LIGHTER AND SWIFTER BECAUSE OF ITS DEEP
3288-7157-0004 PRIMAL GLADNESS HER EYES DWELT AFFECTIONATELY ON GREEN GABLES PEERING THROUGH ITS NETWORK OF TREES AND REFLECTING THE SUNLIGHT BACK FROM ITS WINDOWS IN SEVERAL LITTLE CORUSCATIONS OF GLORY MARILLA
3288-7157-0005 AS SHE PICKED HER STEPS ALONG THE DAMP LANE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS REALLY A SATISFACTION TO KNOW THAT SHE WAS GOING HOME TO A BRISKLY SNAPPING WOOD FIRE AND A TABLE NICELY SPREAD FOR TEA INSTEAD OF TO THE COLD COMFORT
3288-7157-0006 AND HAVE TEA READY AT FIVE O'CLOCK BUT NOW SHE MUST HURRY TO TAKE OFF HER SECOND BEST DRESS AND PREPARE THE MEAL HERSELF AGAINST MATTHEW'S RETURN FROM PLOWING I'LL SETTLE MISS ANNE WHEN SHE COMES HOME
3288-7157-0007 SAID MARILLA GRIMLY AS SHE SHAVED UP KINDLINGS WITH A CARVING KNIFE AND WITH MORE VIM THAN WAS STRICTLY NECESSARY
3288-7157-0008 WAS WAITING PATIENTLY FOR HIS TEA IN HIS CORNER SHE'S GADDING OFF SOMEWHERE WITH DIANA WRITING STORIES OR PRACTICING DIALOGUES OR SOME SUCH TOMFOOLERY AND NEVER THINKING ONCE ABOUT THE TIME OR HER DUTIES
3288-7157-0009 SHE'S JUST GOT TO BE PULLED UP SHORT AND SUDDEN ON THIS SORT OF THING I DON'T CARE IF MISSUS ALLAN DOES SAY SHE'S THE BRIGHTEST AND SWEETEST CHILD SHE EVER KNEW SHE MAY BE BRIGHT AND SWEET ENOUGH
3288-7157-0010 BUT HER HEAD IS FULL OF NONSENSE AND THERE'S NEVER ANY KNOWING WHAT SHAPE IT'LL BREAK OUT IN NEXT JUST AS SOON AS SHE GROWS OUT OF ONE FREAK SHE TAKES UP WITH ANOTHER BUT THERE
3288-7157-0011 ANNE'S GOT PLENTY OF FAULTS GOODNESS KNOWS AND FAR BE IT FROM ME TO DENY IT BUT I'M BRINGING HER UP AND NOT RACHEL LYNDE WHO'D PICK FAULTS IN THE ANGEL GABRIEL HIMSELF IF HE LIVED IN AVONLEA
3288-7157-0012 JUST THE SAME ANNE HAS NO BUSINESS TO LEAVE THE HOUSE LIKE THIS WHEN I TOLD HER SHE WAS TO STAY HOME THIS AFTERNOON AND LOOK AFTER THINGS I MUST SAY
3288-7157-0013 WITH ALL HER FAULTS I NEVER FOUND HER DISOBEDIENT OR UNTRUSTWORTHY BEFORE AND I'M REAL SORRY TO FIND HER SO NOW WELL NOW I DUNNO SAID MATTHEW WHO BEING PATIENT AND WISE
3288-7157-0014 AND ABOVE ALL HUNGRY HAD DEEMED IT BEST TO LET MARILLA TALK HER WRATH OUT UNHINDERED HAVING LEARNED BY EXPERIENCE THAT SHE GOT THROUGH WITH WHATEVER WORK WAS ON HAND MUCH QUICKER
3288-7157-0015 ANNE'S A GREAT HAND AT EXPLAINING SHE'S NOT HERE WHEN I TOLD HER TO STAY RETORTED MARILLA I RECKON SHE'LL FIND IT HARD TO EXPLAIN THAT TO MY SATISFACTION OF COURSE I KNEW YOU'D TAKE HER PART MATTHEW
3288-7157-0016 BUT I'M BRINGING HER UP NOT YOU IT WAS DARK WHEN SUPPER WAS READY AND STILL NO SIGN OF ANNE COMING HURRIEDLY OVER THE LOG BRIDGE OR UP LOVER'S LANE BREATHLESS AND REPENTANT WITH A SENSE OF NEGLECTED DUTIES
3288-7157-0017 MARILLA WASHED AND PUT AWAY THE DISHES GRIMLY THEN WANTING A CANDLE TO LIGHT HER WAY DOWN THE CELLAR SHE WENT UP TO THE EAST GABLE FOR THE ONE THAT GENERALLY STOOD ON ANNE'S TABLE LIGHTING IT SHE TURNED AROUND
3288-7157-0018 DEMANDED MARILLA ANXIOUSLY GOING OVER TO THE BED ANNE COWERED DEEPER INTO HER PILLOWS AS IF DESIROUS OF HIDING HERSELF FOREVER FROM MORTAL EYES NO BUT PLEASE MARILLA
3288-7157-0019 GO AWAY AND DON'T LOOK AT ME I'M IN THE DEPTHS OF DESPAIR AND I DON'T CARE WHO GETS HEAD IN CLASS OR WRITES THE BEST COMPOSITION OR SINGS IN THE SUNDAY SCHOOL CHOIR ANY MORE LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT ARE OF NO IMPORTANCE NOW
3288-7157-0020 BECAUSE I DON'T SUPPOSE I'LL EVER BE ABLE TO GO ANYWHERE AGAIN MY CAREER IS CLOSED PLEASE MARILLA GO AWAY AND DON'T LOOK AT ME DID ANYONE EVER HEAR THE LIKE THE MYSTIFIED MARILLA WANTED TO KNOW
3288-7157-0021 IN DESPAIRING OBEDIENCE LOOK AT MY HAIR MARILLA SHE WHISPERED ACCORDINGLY MARILLA LIFTED HER CANDLE AND LOOKED SCRUTINIZINGLY AT ANNE'S HAIR FLOWING IN HEAVY MASSES DOWN HER BACK
3288-7157-0022 IT CERTAINLY HAD A VERY STRANGE APPEARANCE ANNE SHIRLEY WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO YOUR HAIR WHY IT'S GREEN GREEN IT MIGHT BE CALLED IF IT WERE ANY EARTHLY COLOR
3288-7157-0023 A QUEER DULL BRONZY GREEN WITH STREAKS HERE AND THERE OF THE ORIGINAL RED TO HEIGHTEN THE GHASTLY EFFECT NEVER IN ALL HER LIFE HAD MARILLA SEEN ANYTHING SO GROTESQUE AS ANNE'S HAIR AT THAT MOMENT
3288-7157-0024 YES IT'S GREEN MOANED ANNE I THOUGHT NOTHING COULD BE AS BAD AS RED HAIR BUT NOW I KNOW IT'S TEN TIMES WORSE TO HAVE GREEN HAIR
3288-7157-0025 OH MARILLA YOU LITTLE KNOW HOW UTTERLY WRETCHED I AM I LITTLE KNOW HOW YOU GOT INTO THIS FIX BUT I MEAN TO FIND OUT SAID MARILLA COME RIGHT DOWN TO THE KITCHEN IT'S TOO COLD UP HERE
3288-7157-0026 AND TELL ME JUST WHAT YOU'VE DONE I'VE BEEN EXPECTING SOMETHING QUEER FOR SOME TIME YOU HAVEN'T GOT INTO ANY SCRAPE FOR OVER TWO MONTHS AND I WAS SURE ANOTHER ONE WAS DUE NOW THEN
3288-7157-0027 WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR I DYED IT DYED IT DYED YOUR HAIR ANNE SHIRLEY DIDN'T YOU KNOW IT WAS A WICKED THING TO DO YES I KNEW IT WAS A LITTLE WICKED ADMITTED ANNE
3288-7157-0028 TO GET RID OF RED HAIR I COUNTED THE COST MARILLA BESIDES I MEANT TO BE EXTRA GOOD IN OTHER WAYS TO MAKE UP FOR IT WELL SAID MARILLA SARCASTICALLY
3288-7157-0029 IF I'D DECIDED IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO DYE MY HAIR I'D HAVE DYED IT A DECENT COLOR AT LEAST I WOULDN'T HAVE DYED IT GREEN BUT I DIDN'T MEAN TO DYE IT GREEN MARILLA PROTESTED ANNE DEJECTEDLY
3288-7157-0030 IF I WAS WICKED I MEANT TO BE WICKED TO SOME PURPOSE HE SAID IT WOULD TURN MY HAIR A BEAUTIFUL RAVEN BLACK HE POSITIVELY ASSURED ME THAT IT WOULD HOW COULD I DOUBT HIS WORD MARILLA
3288-7157-0031 I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE YOUR WORD DOUBTED AND MISSUS ALLAN SAYS WE SHOULD NEVER SUSPECT ANYONE OF NOT TELLING US THE TRUTH UNLESS WE HAVE PROOF THAT THEY'RE NOT I HAVE PROOF NOW GREEN HAIR IS PROOF ENOUGH FOR ANYBODY
3288-7157-0032 BUT I HADN'T THEN AND I BELIEVED EVERY WORD HE SAID IMPLICITLY WHO SAID WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE PEDDLER THAT WAS HERE THIS AFTERNOON I BOUGHT THE DYE FROM HIM
3288-7157-0033 ANNE SHIRLEY HOW OFTEN HAVE I TOLD YOU NEVER TO LET ONE OF THOSE ITALIANS IN THE HOUSE I DON'T BELIEVE IN ENCOURAGING THEM TO COME AROUND AT ALL OH I DIDN'T LET HIM IN THE HOUSE I REMEMBERED WHAT YOU TOLD ME AND I WENT OUT
3288-7157-0034 CAREFULLY SHUT THE DOOR AND LOOKED AT HIS THINGS ON THE STEP BESIDES HE WASN'T AN ITALIAN HE WAS A GERMAN JEW HE HAD A BIG BOX FULL OF VERY INTERESTING THINGS
3288-7157-0035 AND HE TOLD ME HE WAS WORKING HARD TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO BRING HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN OUT FROM GERMANY HE SPOKE SO FEELINGLY ABOUT THEM THAT IT TOUCHED MY HEART I WANTED TO BUY SOMETHING FROM HIM TO HELP HIM IN SUCH A WORTHY OBJECT
3288-7157-0036 THE PEDDLER SAID IT WAS WARRANTED TO DYE ANY HAIR A BEAUTIFUL RAVEN BLACK AND WOULDN'T WASH OFF IN A TRICE I SAW MYSELF WITH BEAUTIFUL RAVEN BLACK HAIR AND THE TEMPTATION WAS IRRESISTIBLE
3288-7157-0037 BUT THE PRICE OF THE BOTTLE WAS SEVENTY FIVE CENTS AND I HAD ONLY FIFTY CENTS LEFT OUT OF MY CHICKEN MONEY I THINK THE PEDDLER HAD A VERY KIND HEART FOR HE SAID THAT SEEING IT WAS ME HE'D SELL IT FOR FIFTY CENTS
3288-7157-0038 AND THAT WAS JUST GIVING IT AWAY SO I BOUGHT IT AND AS SOON AS HE HAD GONE I CAME UP HERE AND APPLIED IT WITH AN OLD HAIRBRUSH AS THE DIRECTIONS SAID I USED UP THE WHOLE BOTTLE AND OH MARILLA
3288-7157-0039 I HOPE YOU'LL REPENT TO GOOD PURPOSE SAID MARILLA SEVERELY AND THAT YOU'VE GOT YOUR EYES OPENED TO WHERE YOUR VANITY HAS LED YOU ANNE GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT'S TO BE DONE I SUPPOSE THE FIRST THING IS TO GIVE YOUR HAIR A GOOD WASHING
3288-7157-0040 AND SEE IF THAT WILL DO ANY GOOD ACCORDINGLY ANNE WASHED HER HAIR SCRUBBING IT VIGOROUSLY WITH SOAP AND WATER BUT FOR ALL THE DIFFERENCE IT MADE SHE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN SCOURING ITS ORIGINAL RED
3288-7157-0041 THE PEDDLER HAD CERTAINLY SPOKEN THE TRUTH WHEN HE DECLARED THAT THE DYE WOULDN'T WASH OFF HOWEVER HIS VERACITY MIGHT BE IMPEACHED IN OTHER RESPECTS OH MARILLA WHAT SHALL I DO
3288-7157-0042 QUESTIONED ANNE IN TEARS I CAN NEVER LIVE THIS DOWN PEOPLE HAVE PRETTY WELL FORGOTTEN MY OTHER MISTAKES THE LINIMENT CAKE AND SETTING DIANA DRUNK AND FLYING INTO A TEMPER WITH MISSUS LYNDE BUT THEY'LL NEVER FORGET THIS
3288-7157-0043 THEY WILL THINK I AM NOT RESPECTABLE OH MARILLA WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE WHEN FIRST WE PRACTICE TO DECEIVE THAT IS POETRY BUT IT IS TRUE AND OH HOW JOSIE PYE WILL LAUGH
3288-7157-0044 MARILLA I CANNOT FACE JOSIE PYE I AM THE UNHAPPIEST GIRL IN PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND ANNE'S UNHAPPINESS CONTINUED FOR A WEEK DURING THAT TIME
3288-7157-0045 SHE WENT NOWHERE AND SHAMPOOED HER HAIR EVERY DAY DIANA ALONE OF OUTSIDERS KNEW THE FATAL SECRET BUT SHE PROMISED SOLEMNLY NEVER TO TELL AND IT MAY BE STATED HERE AND NOW THAT SHE KEPT HER WORD
3288-7157-0046 AT THE END OF THE WEEK MARILLA SAID DECIDEDLY IT'S NO USE ANNE THAT IS FAST DYE IF EVER THERE WAS ANY YOUR HAIR MUST BE CUT OFF THERE IS NO OTHER WAY YOU CAN'T GO OUT WITH IT LOOKING LIKE THAT
3288-7157-0047 ANNE'S LIPS QUIVERED BUT SHE REALIZED THE BITTER TRUTH OF MARILLA'S REMARKS WITH A DISMAL SIGH SHE WENT FOR THE SCISSORS
3288-7157-0048 OH I FEEL THAT MY HEART IS BROKEN THIS IS SUCH AN UNROMANTIC AFFLICTION THE GIRLS IN BOOKS LOSE THEIR HAIR IN FEVERS OR SELL IT TO GET MONEY FOR SOME GOOD DEED
3288-7157-0049 AND I'M SURE I WOULDN'T MIND LOSING MY HAIR IN SOME SUCH FASHION HALF SO MUCH BUT THERE IS NOTHING COMFORTING IN HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT OFF BECAUSE YOU'VE DYED IT A DREADFUL COLOR IS THERE I'M GOING TO WEEP
3288-7157-0050 ALL THE TIME YOU'RE CUTTING IT OFF IF IT WON'T INTERFERE IT SEEMS SUCH A TRAGIC THING ANNE WEPT THEN BUT LATER ON WHEN SHE WENT UPSTAIRS AND LOOKED IN THE GLASS
3288-7157-0051 SHE WAS CALM WITH DESPAIR MARILLA HAD DONE HER WORK THOROUGHLY AND IT HAD BEEN NECESSARY TO SHINGLE THE HAIR AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE THE RESULT WAS NOT BECOMING
3288-7157-0052 SHE SUDDENLY RIGHTED THE GLASS YES I WILL TOO I'D DO PENANCE FOR BEING WICKED THAT WAY I'LL LOOK AT MYSELF EVERY TIME I COME TO MY ROOM AND SEE HOW UGLY I AM AND I WON'T TRY TO IMAGINE IT AWAY EITHER
3288-7157-0053 MADE A SENSATION IN SCHOOL ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY BUT TO HER RELIEF NOBODY GUESSED THE REAL REASON FOR IT NOT EVEN JOSIE PYE WHO HOWEVER DID NOT FAIL TO INFORM ANNE THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A PERFECT SCARECROW
3288-7157-0054 I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING WHEN JOSIE SAID THAT TO ME ANNE CONFIDED THAT EVENING TO MARILLA WHO WAS LYING ON THE SOFA AFTER ONE OF HER HEADACHES BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS PART OF MY PUNISHMENT AND I OUGHT TO BEAR IT PATIENTLY
3288-7157-0055 IT'S HARD TO BE TOLD YOU LOOK LIKE A SCARECROW AND I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING BACK BUT I DIDN'T I JUST SWEPT HER ONE SCORNFUL LOOK AND THEN I FORGAVE HER IT MAKES YOU FEEL VERY VIRTUOUS WHEN YOU FORGIVE PEOPLE DOESN'T IT
3288-7157-0056 I MEAN TO DEVOTE ALL MY ENERGIES TO BEING GOOD AFTER THIS AND I SHALL NEVER TRY TO BE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN OF COURSE IT'S BETTER TO BE GOOD I KNOW IT IS BUT IT'S SOMETIMES SO HARD TO BELIEVE A THING EVEN WHEN YOU KNOW IT
3288-7157-0057 I DO REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD MARILLA LIKE YOU AND MISSUS ALLAN AND MISS STACY AND GROW UP TO BE A CREDIT TO YOU DIANA SAYS WHEN MY HAIR BEGINS TO GROW TO TIE A BLACK VELVET RIBBON AROUND MY HEAD
3288-7157-0058 SHE SAYS SHE THINKS IT WILL BE VERY BECOMING I WILL CALL IT A SNOOD THAT SOUNDS SO ROMANTIC BUT AM I TALKING TOO MUCH MARILLA DOES IT HURT YOUR HEAD
3288-7157-0059 MY HEAD IS BETTER NOW IT WAS TERRIBLE BAD THIS AFTERNOON THOUGH THESE HEADACHES OF MINE ARE GETTING WORSE AND WORSE I'LL HAVE TO SEE A DOCTOR ABOUT THEM
