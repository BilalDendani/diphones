7981-112056-0000 A GREAT HOUSEHOLD VINCENT REMAINED TWO YEARS IN THE HOUSE OF FATHER DE BERULLE IN THE HOPE OF OBTAINING PERMANENT WORK THE ADMINISTRATION OF A POOR COUNTRY PARISH WAS HE MAINTAINED THE ONLY THING HE WAS FIT FOR
7981-112056-0001 WHILE HE WAS WITH DE BERULLE WAS OF THE SAME OPINION HE WILL BE THE HOLIEST PRIEST OF HIS TIME HE SAID ONE DAY AS HE WATCHED HIM AS FOR VINCENT HE WAS COMPLETELY WON BY THE GENTLE SERENITY OF SAINT FRANCIS AND TOOK HIM AS MODEL IN HIS RELATIONS WITH OTHERS
7981-112056-0002 AT LAST VINCENT'S DESIRE SEEMED ABOUT TO BE FULFILLED A FRIEND OF DE BERULLE'S CURE OF THE COUNTRY PARISH OF CLICHY NEAR PARIS ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION OF ENTERING THE ORATORY
7981-112056-0003 AND AT DE BERULLE'S REQUEST CHOSE VINCENT DE PAUL AS HIS SUCCESSOR HERE AMIDST HIS BELOVED POOR VINCENT WAS COMPLETELY HAPPY
7981-112056-0004 AND ANY SON OF POOR PARENTS WHO SHOWED A VOCATION FOR THE PRIESTHOOD WAS TAKEN INTO THE PRESBYTERY AND TAUGHT BY VINCENT HIMSELF THE PARISH CHURCH WHICH WAS IN GREAT DISREPAIR WAS REBUILT OLD STANDING QUARRELS WERE MADE UP
7981-112056-0005 VINCENT WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO A LIFE SPENT IN EARNEST WORK AMONG HIS PEOPLE WHEN A SUMMONS FROM FATHER DE BERULLE RECALLED HIM SUDDENLY TO PARIS
7981-112056-0006 NOTHING LESS THAN THE RESIGNATION OF HIS BELOVED CLICHY WAS NOW ASKED OF HIM BY THIS FRIEND TO WHOM HE OWED SO MUCH ONE OF THE GREATEST NOBLEMEN OF FRANCE
7981-112056-0007 AND THAT AS HE WAS EVIDENTLY DESTINED TO DO GREAT WORK FOR GOD IT WOULD BE TO HIS ADVANTAGE TO HAVE POWERFUL AND INFLUENTIAL FRIENDS ALTHOUGH THE PROSPECT OF SUCH A POST FILLED THE HUMBLE PARISH PRIEST WITH CONSTERNATION
7981-112056-0008 HE OWED TOO MUCH TO DE BERULLE TO REFUSE SETTING OUT FROM CLICHY WITH HIS WORLDLY GOODS ON A HAND BARROW HE ARRIVED AT THE ORATORY
7981-112056-0009 THE HOUSE OF MESSIRE DE GONDI WAS ONE OF THE MOST MAGNIFICENT IN PARIS THE COUNT ONE OF THE BRAVEST AND HANDSOMEST MEN OF HIS DAY WAS IN HIGH FAVOR AT COURT
7981-112056-0010 WAS REMARKABLE FOR HER FERVOR AND PIETY THE DE GONDI CHILDREN UNFORTUNATELY DID NOT TAKE AFTER THEIR PARENTS AND THE TWO BOYS WHOSE EDUCATION VINCENT WAS TO UNDERTAKE AND WHOSE CHARACTER HE WAS TO FORM WERE DESCRIBED BY THEIR AUNT AS
7981-112056-0011 REGULAR LITTLE DEMONS THE YOUNGEST OF THE FAMILY THE FAMOUS OR RATHER INFAMOUS CARDINAL DE RETZ WAS NOT YET BORN BUT VINCENT'S HANDS WERE SUFFICIENTLY FULL WITHOUT HIM
7981-112056-0012 I SHOULD LIKE MY CHILDREN TO BE SAINTS RATHER THAN GREAT NOBLEMEN SAID MADAME DE GONDI WHEN SHE PRESENTED THE BOYS TO THEIR TUTOR BUT THE PROSPECT SEEMED REMOTE ENOUGH THE VIOLENT TEMPER AND OBSTINACY OF HIS CHARGES WERE A GREAT TRIAL TO VINCENT
7981-112056-0013 VINCENT WAS A DEPENDENT BUT THERE WAS A QUIET DIGNITY ABOUT HIM WHICH FORBADE LIBERTIES WITH THE SERVANTS AND THERE WERE MANY OF EVERY GRADE HE WAS ALWAYS CORDIAL AND POLITE LOSING NO CHANCE OF WINNING THEIR CONFIDENCE
7981-112056-0014 THAT HE MIGHT INFLUENCE THEM FOR GOOD HIS DUTIES OVER HE WOULD RETIRE TO HIS OWN ROOM REFUSING UNLESS ESPECIALLY SENT FOR TO MIX WITH THE GREAT PEOPLE WHO FREQUENTED THE HOUSE
7981-112056-0015 SHE APPLIED TO FATHER DE BERULLE TO USE HIS INFLUENCE IN THE MATTER AND THUS OBTAINED HER DESIRE AT VINCENT'S SUGGESTION SHE SOON AFTERWARDS UNDERTOOK CERTAIN WORKS OF CHARITY WHICH WERE DESTINED TO BE THE SEED OF A GREAT ENTERPRISE
7981-112056-0016 THE COUNT TOO BEGAN TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF VINCENT'S PRESENCE IN HIS HOUSEHOLD IT WAS THE AGE OF DUELING AND HUNDREDS OF LIVES WERE LOST IN THIS BARBAROUS PRACTICE DE GONDI WAS A FAMOUS SWORDSMAN
7981-112056-0017 OR OF REFRAINING FROM CHALLENGING ANOTHER WHEN HIS HONOR WAS AT STAKE HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM VINCENT HAD BEEN SOME TIME AT THE DE GONDIS WHEN IT CAME TO HIS EARS THAT THE COUNT INTENDED TO FIGHT A DUEL ON A CERTAIN DAY AND HE RESOLVED IF POSSIBLE TO PREVENT IT
7981-112056-0018 DE GONDI WAS PRESENT AT MASS IN THE MORNING AND REMAINED ON AFTERWARDS IN THE CHAPEL PRAYING PROBABLY THAT HE MIGHT PREVAIL OVER HIS ENEMY VINCENT WAITED TILL EVERYONE HAD GONE OUT AND THEN APPROACHED HIM SOFTLY MONSIEUR HE SAID
7981-112056-0019 I KNOW THAT YOU INTEND TO FIGHT A DUEL AND I TELL YOU AS A MESSAGE FROM MY SAVIOUR BEFORE WHOM YOU KNEEL THAT IF YOU DO NOT RENOUNCE THIS INTENTION HIS JUDGMENT WILL FALL ON YOU AND YOURS
7981-112056-0020 TENDING THE SICK WITH HER OWN HANDS
7981-112056-0021 PROFANING THE SACRAMENTS AND DECEIVING ALL WHO KNEW HIM
7981-112056-0022 ACKNOWLEDGING HIS GUILT ALSO TO MADAME DE GONDI WHO CAME TO VISIT HIM AFTER VINCENT HAD DEPARTED AH MADAME HE CRIED IF I HAD NOT MADE THAT GENERAL CONFESSION MY SOUL WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST FOR ALL ETERNITY
7981-112056-0023 IT WAS A TERRIBLE THOUGHT AH MONSIEUR VINCENT CRIED THE GREAT LADY HOW MANY SOULS ARE BEING LOST CAN YOU DO NOTHING TO HELP THEM HER WORDS FOUND AN ECHO IN VINCENT'S HEART
7981-112056-0024 NEXT SUNDAY HE PREACHED A SERMON IN THE PARISH CHURCH ON THE NECESSITY OF GENERAL CONFESSION IT WAS THE FIRST OF THE FAMOUS MISSION SERMONS DESTINED TO DO SO MUCH GOOD IN FRANCE WHILE HE SPOKE MADAME DE GONDI PRAYED AND THE RESULT FAR SURPASSED THEIR EXPECTATIONS
7981-112056-0025 HIS WORK AS A TUTOR HAD BEEN A FAILURE HE TOLD HIM HE COULD DO NOTHING WITH HIS PUPILS AND HE WAS RECEIVING HONOR WHICH HE IN NO WAY DESERVED HE ENDED BY BEGGING TO BE ALLOWED TO WORK FOR THE POOR IN SOME HUMBLE AND LONELY PLACE
7981-112056-0026 AND DE BERULLE DECIDED TO GRANT HIS WISH THE COUNTRY PARISH OF CHATILLON WAS IN NEED OF WORKERS WAS THE ANSWER LET HIM GO THERE AND EXERCISE HIS ZEAL FOR SOULS THE ONLY REMAINING DIFFICULTY WAS TO GET AWAY FROM THE GREAT HOUSE
7981-112056-0027 AND THE ARGUMENTS THAT WOULD BE USED AGAINST HIM
7981-112056-0028 MADAME DE GONDI DID NOTHING BUT WEEP WHILE HER HUSBAND APPLIED TO EVERYONE WHOM HE THOUGHT TO HAVE ANY INFLUENCE WITH VINCENT TO PERSUADE HIM TO RETURN IF HE HAS NOT THE GIFT OF TEACHING CHILDREN HE WROTE TO A FRIEND IT DOES NOT MATTER
