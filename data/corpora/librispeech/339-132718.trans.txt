339-132718-0000 RASH ADVANCES NOT MORE THAN TEN OR FIFTEEN MILES WE JUDGED IT FROM OUR LANDING ROCK TO THAT LAST VILLAGE FOR ALL OUR EAGERNESS WE THOUGHT IT WISE TO KEEP TO THE WOODS AND GO CAREFULLY
339-132718-0001 EVEN TERRY'S ARDOR WAS HELD IN CHECK BY HIS FIRM CONVICTION THAT THERE WERE MEN TO BE MET AND WE SAW TO IT THAT EACH OF US HAD A GOOD STOCK OF CARTRIDGES THEY MAY BE SCARCE AND THEY MAY BE HIDDEN AWAY SOMEWHERE SOME KIND OF
339-132718-0002 FOR THAT MATTER THEY MAY LIVE UP IN THE MOUNTAINS YONDER AND KEEP THE WOMEN IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY SORT OF A NATIONAL HAREM BUT THERE ARE MEN SOMEWHERE DIDN'T YOU SEE THE BABIES WE HAD ALL SEEN BABIES CHILDREN BIG AND LITTLE
339-132718-0003 FIRST TIE YOUR CAMEL AND THEN TRUST IN THE LORD JEFF MURMURED SO WE ALL HAD OUR WEAPONS IN HAND AND STOLE CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE FOREST TERRY STUDIED IT AS WE PROGRESSED TALK OF CIVILIZATION
339-132718-0004 HE CRIED SOFTLY IN RESTRAINED ENTHUSIASM I NEVER SAW A FOREST SO PETTED EVEN IN
339-132718-0005 THE REST SPLENDID HARDWOOD CALL THIS A FOREST IT'S A TRUCK FARM GOOD THING TO HAVE A BOTANIST ON HAND I AGREED SURE THERE ARE NO MEDICINAL ONES OR ANY FOR PURE ORNAMENT AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY WERE QUITE RIGHT
339-132718-0006 THESE TOWERING TREES WERE UNDER AS CAREFUL CULTIVATION AS SO MANY CABBAGES IN OTHER CONDITIONS
339-132718-0007 AND FRUIT GATHERERS BUT AN AIRSHIP IS A CONSPICUOUS OBJECT AND BY NO MEANS QUIET AND WOMEN ARE CAUTIOUS
339-132718-0008 A LITTLE HAPPY SOUND INSTANTLY SMOTHERED WE STOOD LIKE SO MANY POINTERS AND THEN USED OUR GLASSES SWIFTLY CAREFULLY
339-132718-0009 THERE WAS A VERY LARGE AND BEAUTIFUL TREE IN THE GLADE WE HAD JUST ENTERED WITH THICK WIDE SPREADING BRANCHES THAT SLOPED OUT IN LAPPING FANS LIKE A BEECH OR PINE IT WAS TRIMMED UNDERNEATH SOME TWENTY FEET UP AND STOOD THERE LIKE A HUGE UMBRELLA
339-132718-0010 WITH CIRCLING SEATS BENEATH LOOK HE PURSUED THERE ARE SHORT STUMPS OF BRANCHES LEFT TO CLIMB ON THERE'S SOMEONE UP THAT TREE I BELIEVE WE STOLE NEAR CAUTIOUSLY
339-132718-0011 THERE AMONG THE BOUGHS OVERHEAD WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN ONE SOMETHING THAT CLUNG MOTIONLESS CLOSE TO THE GREAT TRUNK AT FIRST AND THEN AS ONE AND ALL WE STARTED UP THE TREE
339-132718-0012 SEPARATED INTO THREE SWIFT MOVING FIGURES AND FLED UPWARD AS WE CLIMBED WE COULD CATCH GLIMPSES OF THEM SCATTERING ABOVE US BY THE TIME WE HAD REACHED ABOUT AS FAR AS THREE MEN TOGETHER DARED PUSH THEY HAD LEFT THE MAIN TRUNK AND MOVED OUTWARD
339-132718-0013 EACH ONE BALANCED ON A LONG BRANCH THAT DIPPED AND SWAYED BENEATH THE WEIGHT WE PAUSED UNCERTAIN IF WE PURSUED FURTHER THE BOUGHS WOULD BREAK UNDER THE DOUBLE BURDEN WE MIGHT SHAKE THEM OFF PERHAPS BUT NONE OF US WAS SO INCLINED
339-132718-0014 IN THE SOFT DAPPLED LIGHT OF THESE HIGH REGIONS BREATHLESS WITH OUR RAPID CLIMB WE RESTED AWHILE EAGERLY STUDYING OUR OBJECTS OF PURSUIT WHILE THEY IN TURN WITH NO MORE TERROR THAN A SET OF FROLICSOME CHILDREN IN A GAME OF TAG
339-132718-0015 ON THEIR PRECARIOUS PERCHES AND FRANKLY CURIOUSLY STARED AT US GIRLS WHISPERED JEFF UNDER HIS BREATH
339-132718-0016 PEACHES ADDED TERRY SCARCELY LOUDER PEACHERINOS APRICOT NECTARINES WHEW THEY WERE GIRLS OF COURSE NO BOYS COULD EVER HAVE SHOWN THAT SPARKLING BEAUTY AND YET
339-132718-0017 NONE OF US WAS CERTAIN AT FIRST WE SAW SHORT HAIR HATLESS LOOSE AND SHINING A SUIT OF SOME LIGHT FIRM STUFF THE CLOSEST OF TUNICS AND KNEEBREECHES MET BY TRIM GAITERS
339-132718-0018 AS BRIGHT AND SMOOTH AS PARROTS AND AS UNAWARE OF DANGER THEY SWUNG THERE BEFORE US WHOLLY AT EASE STARING AS WE STARED TILL FIRST ONE AND THEN ALL OF THEM BURST INTO PEALS OF DELIGHTED LAUGHTER
339-132718-0019 THEN THERE WAS A TORRENT OF SOFT TALK TOSSED BACK AND FORTH NO SAVAGE SING SONG BUT CLEAR MUSICAL FLUENT SPEECH WE MET THEIR LAUGHTER CORDIALLY AND DOFFED OUR HATS TO THEM AT WHICH THEY LAUGHED AGAIN
339-132718-0020 DELIGHTEDLY THEN TERRY WHOLLY IN HIS ELEMENT MADE A POLITE SPEECH WITH EXPLANATORY GESTURES AND PROCEEDED TO INTRODUCE US WITH POINTING FINGER MISTER JEFF MARGRAVE HE SAID CLEARLY
339-132718-0021 I ALSO TRIED TO MAKE AN EFFECTIVE SALUTE AND NEARLY LOST MY BALANCE
339-132718-0022 A FINE CHEST HE HAD TOO AND INTRODUCED HIMSELF HE WAS BRACED CAREFULLY FOR THE OCCASION AND ACHIEVED AN EXCELLENT OBEISANCE AGAIN THEY LAUGHED DELIGHTEDLY AND THE ONE NEAREST ME FOLLOWED HIS TACTICS
339-132718-0023 SHE LAID A FIRM DELICATE HAND ON HER GOLD GREEN JERKIN ELLADOR THIS WAS PLEASANT BUT WE GOT NO NEARER WE CAN'T SIT HERE AND LEARN THE LANGUAGE TERRY PROTESTED
339-132718-0024 HE SUGGESTED BY SIGNS THAT WE ALL GO DOWN TOGETHER BUT AGAIN THEY SHOOK THEIR HEADS STILL MERRILY THEN ELLADOR CLEARLY INDICATED THAT WE SHOULD GO DOWN POINTING TO EACH AND ALL OF US WITH UNMISTAKABLE FIRMNESS AND FURTHER
339-132718-0025 HE PRODUCED FROM AN INNER POCKET A LITTLE BOX OF PURPLE VELVET THAT OPENED WITH A SNAP AND OUT OF IT HE DREW A LONG SPARKLING THING
339-132718-0026 OFFERED IT FIRST TO ONE THEN TO ANOTHER HOLDING IT OUT AS FAR AS HE COULD REACH TOWARD THE GIRL NEAREST HIM HE STOOD BRACED IN THE FORK HELD FIRMLY BY ONE HAND THE OTHER SWINGING HIS BRIGHT TEMPTATION REACHED FAR OUT ALONG THE BOUGH
339-132718-0027 BUT NOT QUITE TO HIS FULL STRETCH SHE WAS VISIBLY MOVED I NOTED HESITATED SPOKE TO HER COMPANIONS THEY CHATTERED SOFTLY TOGETHER
339-132718-0028 THEN SOFTLY AND SLOWLY SHE DREW NEARER THIS WAS ALIMA A TALL LONG LIMBED LASS WELL KNIT AND EVIDENTLY BOTH STRONG AND AGILE HER EYES WERE SPLENDID WIDE FEARLESS
339-132718-0029 AS FREE FROM SUSPICION AS A CHILD'S WHO HAS NEVER BEEN REBUKED HER INTEREST WAS MORE THAT OF AN INTENT BOY PLAYING A FASCINATING GAME THAN OF A GIRL LURED BY AN ORNAMENT THE OTHERS MOVED A BIT FARTHER OUT HOLDING FIRMLY WATCHING
339-132718-0030 TERRY'S SMILE WAS IRREPROACHABLE BUT I DID NOT LIKE THE LOOK IN HIS EYES IT WAS LIKE A CREATURE ABOUT TO SPRING I COULD ALREADY SEE IT HAPPEN THE DROPPED NECKLACE THE SUDDEN CLUTCHING HAND THE GIRL'S SHARP CRY AS HE SEIZED HER AND DREW HER IN BUT IT
339-132718-0031 DIDN'T HAPPEN SHE MADE A TIMID REACH WITH HER RIGHT HAND FOR THE GAY SWINGING THING HE HELD IT A LITTLE NEARER THEN SWIFT AS LIGHT SHE SEIZED IT FROM HIM WITH HER LEFT AND DROPPED ON THE INSTANT TO THE BOUGH BELOW HE MADE HIS SNATCH QUITE VAINLY
339-132718-0032 ALMOST LOSING HIS POSITION AS HIS HAND CLUTCHED ONLY AIR AND THEN WITH INCONCEIVABLE RAPIDITY THE THREE BRIGHT CREATURES WERE GONE THEY DROPPED FROM THE ENDS OF THE BIG BOUGHS TO THOSE BELOW FAIRLY POURING THEMSELVES OFF THE TREE
339-132718-0033 WHILE WE CLIMBED DOWNWARD AS SWIFTLY AS WE COULD WE HEARD THEIR VANISHING GAY LAUGHTER WE SAW THEM FLEETING AWAY IN THE WIDE OPEN REACHES OF THE FOREST AND GAVE CHASE BUT WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE CHASED WILD ANTELOPES SO WE STOPPED AT LENGTH SOMEWHAT BREATHLESS
339-132718-0034 MY WORD THE MEN OF THIS COUNTRY MUST BE GOOD SPRINTERS INHABITANTS EVIDENTLY ARBOREAL I GRIMLY SUGGESTED CIVILIZED AND STILL ARBOREAL PECULIAR PEOPLE
339-132718-0035 THEY WERE PERFECTLY FRIENDLY NOW WE'VE SCARED THEM BUT IT WAS NO USE GRUMBLING AND TERRY REFUSED TO ADMIT ANY MISTAKE NONSENSE HE SAID THEY EXPECTED IT WOMEN LIKE TO BE RUN AFTER
339-132718-0036 THIS DIRECTION AND NOT FAR FROM THE WOODS AS I REMEMBER WHEN WE REACHED THE EDGE OF THE OPEN COUNTRY WE RECONNOITERED WITH OUR FIELD GLASSES THERE IT WAS ABOUT FOUR MILES OFF THE SAME TOWN WE CONCLUDED UNLESS AS JEFF VENTURED THEY ALL HAD PINK HOUSES
