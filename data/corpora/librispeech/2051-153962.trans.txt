2051-153962-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE MUSICAL BANKS ON MY RETURN TO THE DRAWING ROOM I FOUND THAT THE MAHAINA CURRENT HAD EXPENDED ITSELF THE LADIES WERE JUST PUTTING AWAY THEIR WORK AND PREPARING TO GO OUT
2051-153962-0001 I ASKED THEM WHERE THEY WERE GOING THEY ANSWERED WITH A CERTAIN AIR OF RESERVE THAT THEY WERE GOING TO THE BANK TO GET SOME MONEY
2051-153962-0002 NOW I HAD ALREADY COLLECTED THAT THE MERCANTILE AFFAIRS OF THE EREWHONIANS WERE CONDUCTED ON A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SYSTEM FROM OUR OWN I HAD HOWEVER GATHERED LITTLE HITHERTO EXCEPT THAT THEY HAD TWO DISTINCT COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS
2051-153962-0003 THAN ANYTHING TO WHICH WE ARE ACCUSTOMED IN EUROPE
2051-153962-0004 WERE DECORATED IN THE MOST PROFUSE FASHION AND ALL MERCANTILE TRANSACTIONS WERE ACCOMPANIED WITH MUSIC SO THAT THEY WERE CALLED MUSICAL BANKS THOUGH THE MUSIC WAS HIDEOUS TO A EUROPEAN EAR
2051-153962-0005 AS FOR THE SYSTEM ITSELF I NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT NEITHER CAN I DO SO NOW THEY HAVE A CODE IN CONNECTION WITH IT WHICH I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT THEY UNDERSTAND BUT NO FOREIGNER CAN HOPE TO DO SO
2051-153962-0006 ONE RULE RUNS INTO AND AGAINST ANOTHER
2051-153962-0007 OR AS IN CHINESE PRONUNCIATION WHEREIN I AM TOLD THAT THE SLIGHTEST CHANGE IN ACCENTUATION OR TONE OF VOICE ALTERS THE MEANING OF A WHOLE SENTENCE
2051-153962-0008 SO FAR HOWEVER AS I COULD COLLECT ANYTHING CERTAIN I GATHERED THAT THEY HAVE TWO DISTINCT CURRENCIES EACH UNDER THE CONTROL OF ITS OWN BANKS AND MERCANTILE CODES ONE OF THESE THE ONE WITH THE MUSICAL BANKS
2051-153962-0009 WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SYSTEM AND TO GIVE OUT THE CURRENCY IN WHICH ALL MONETARY TRANSACTIONS SHOULD BE CARRIED ON AND AS FAR AS I COULD SEE ALL WHO WISHED TO BE CONSIDERED RESPECTABLE KEPT A LARGER OR SMALLER BALANCE AT THESE BANKS ON THE OTHER HAND
2051-153962-0010 IT IS THAT THE AMOUNT SO KEPT HAD NO DIRECT COMMERCIAL VALUE IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD I AM SURE THAT THE MANAGERS AND CASHIERS OF THE MUSICAL BANKS WERE NOT PAID IN THEIR OWN CURRENCY
2051-153962-0011 MISTER NOSNIBOR USED TO GO TO THESE BANKS OR RATHER TO THE GREAT MOTHER BANK OF THE CITY SOMETIMES BUT NOT VERY OFTEN HE WAS A PILLAR OF ONE OF THE OTHER KIND OF BANKS
2051-153962-0012 THE LADIES GENERALLY WENT ALONE AS INDEED WAS THE CASE IN MOST FAMILIES EXCEPT ON STATE OCCASIONS I HAD LONG WANTED TO KNOW MORE OF THIS STRANGE SYSTEM
2051-153962-0013 AND HAD THE GREATEST DESIRE TO ACCOMPANY MY HOSTESS AND HER DAUGHTERS I HAD SEEN THEM GO OUT ALMOST EVERY MORNING SINCE MY ARRIVAL AND HAD NOTICED THAT THEY CARRIED THEIR PURSES IN THEIR HANDS NOT EXACTLY OSTENTATIOUSLY
2051-153962-0014 I HAD NEVER HOWEVER YET BEEN ASKED TO GO WITH THEM MYSELF
2051-153962-0015 IT IS NOT EASY TO CONVEY A PERSON'S MANNER BY WORDS AND I CAN HARDLY GIVE ANY IDEA OF THE PECULIAR FEELING THAT CAME UPON ME WHEN I SAW THE LADIES ON THE POINT OF STARTING FOR THE BANK
2051-153962-0016 THERE WAS A SOMETHING OF REGRET A SOMETHING AS THOUGH THEY WOULD WISH TO TAKE ME WITH THEM BUT DID NOT LIKE TO ASK ME AND YET AS THOUGH I WERE HARDLY TO ASK TO BE TAKEN I WAS DETERMINED HOWEVER
2051-153962-0017 ABOUT MY GOING WITH THEM AND AFTER A LITTLE PARLEYING AND MANY INQUIRIES AS TO WHETHER I WAS PERFECTLY SURE THAT I MYSELF WISHED TO GO IT WAS DECIDED THAT I MIGHT DO SO
2051-153962-0018 WE PASSED THROUGH SEVERAL STREETS OF MORE OR LESS CONSIDERABLE HOUSES AND AT LAST TURNING ROUND A CORNER WE CAME UPON A LARGE PIAZZA AT THE END OF WHICH WAS A MAGNIFICENT BUILDING
2051-153962-0019 OF A STRANGE BUT NOBLE ARCHITECTURE AND OF GREAT ANTIQUITY IT DID NOT OPEN DIRECTLY ON TO THE PIAZZA THERE BEING A SCREEN THROUGH WHICH WAS AN ARCHWAY BETWEEN THE PIAZZA AND THE ACTUAL PRECINCTS OF THE BANK
2051-153962-0020 ON PASSING UNDER THE ARCHWAY WE ENTERED UPON A GREEN SWARD
2051-153962-0021 WHILE IN FRONT OF US UPROSE THE MAJESTIC TOWERS OF THE BANK AND ITS VENERABLE FRONT
2051-153962-0022 AND ADORNED WITH ALL SORTS OF MARBLES AND MANY SCULPTURES ON EITHER SIDE THERE WERE BEAUTIFUL OLD TREES WHEREIN THE BIRDS WERE BUSY BY THE HUNDRED AND A NUMBER OF QUAINT BUT SUBSTANTIAL HOUSES OF SINGULARLY COMFORTABLE APPEARANCE
2051-153962-0023 THEY WERE SITUATED IN THE MIDST OF ORCHARDS AND GARDENS AND GAVE ME AN IMPRESSION OF GREAT PEACE AND PLENTY INDEED IT HAD BEEN NO ERROR TO SAY THAT THIS BUILDING WAS ONE THAT APPEALED TO THE IMAGINATION
2051-153962-0024 IT DID MORE IT CARRIED BOTH IMAGINATION AND JUDGEMENT BY STORM IT WAS AN EPIC IN STONE AND MARBLE AND SO POWERFUL WAS THE EFFECT IT PRODUCED ON ME THAT AS I BEHELD IT I WAS CHARMED AND MELTED
2051-153962-0025 I FELT MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE EXISTENCE OF A REMOTE PAST ONE KNOWS OF THIS ALWAYS BUT THE KNOWLEDGE IS NEVER SO LIVING AS IN THE ACTUAL PRESENCE OF SOME WITNESS TO THE LIFE OF BYGONE AGES
2051-153962-0026 I FELT HOW SHORT A SPACE OF HUMAN LIFE WAS THE PERIOD OF OUR OWN EXISTENCE
2051-153962-0027 AND MUCH MORE INCLINABLE TO BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE WHOSE SENSE OF THE FITNESS OF THINGS WAS EQUAL TO THE UPRAISING OF SO SERENE A HANDIWORK WERE HARDLY LIKELY TO BE WRONG IN THE CONCLUSIONS THEY MIGHT COME TO UPON ANY SUBJECT
2051-153962-0028 MY FEELING CERTAINLY WAS THAT THE CURRENCY OF THIS BANK MUST BE THE RIGHT ONE
2051-153962-0029 IF THE OUTSIDE HAD BEEN IMPRESSIVE THE INSIDE WAS EVEN MORE SO IT WAS VERY LOFTY AND DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL PARTS BY WALLS WHICH RESTED UPON MASSIVE PILLARS
2051-153962-0030 THE WINDOWS WERE FILLED WITH STAINED GLASS DESCRIPTIVE OF THE PRINCIPAL COMMERCIAL INCIDENTS OF THE BANK FOR MANY AGES IN A REMOTE PART OF THE BUILDING THERE WERE MEN AND BOYS SINGING THIS WAS THE ONLY DISTURBING FEATURE
2051-153962-0031 FOR AS THE GAMUT WAS STILL UNKNOWN THERE WAS NO MUSIC IN THE COUNTRY WHICH COULD BE AGREEABLE TO A EUROPEAN EAR
2051-153962-0032 AND THE WAILING OF THE WIND WHICH LAST THEY TRIED TO IMITATE IN MELANCHOLY CADENCES THAT AT TIMES DEGENERATED INTO A HOWL TO MY THINKING THE NOISE WAS HIDEOUS BUT IT PRODUCED A GREAT EFFECT UPON MY COMPANIONS
2051-153962-0033 WHO PROFESSED THEMSELVES MUCH MOVED AS SOON AS THE SINGING WAS OVER THE LADIES REQUESTED ME TO STAY WHERE I WAS WHILE THEY WENT INSIDE THE PLACE FROM WHICH IT HAD SEEMED TO COME DURING THEIR ABSENCE CERTAIN REFLECTIONS FORCED THEMSELVES UPON ME
2051-153962-0034 IN THE FIRST PLACE IT STRUCK ME AS STRANGE THAT THE BUILDING SHOULD BE SO NEARLY EMPTY I WAS ALMOST ALONE AND THE FEW BESIDES MYSELF HAD BEEN LED BY CURIOSITY AND HAD NO INTENTION OF DOING BUSINESS WITH THE BANK
2051-153962-0035 BUT THERE MIGHT BE MORE INSIDE I STOLE UP TO THE CURTAIN AND VENTURED TO DRAW THE EXTREME EDGE OF IT ON ONE SIDE NO THERE WAS HARDLY ANY ONE THERE
2051-153962-0036 I ALSO SAW MY HOSTESS AND HER DAUGHTERS AND TWO OR THREE OTHER LADIES ALSO THREE OR FOUR OLD WOMEN
2051-153962-0037 BUT THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE THIS DID NOT LOOK AS THOUGH THE BANK WAS DOING A VERY LARGE BUSINESS AND YET I HAD ALWAYS BEEN TOLD THAT EVERY ONE IN THE CITY DEALT WITH THIS ESTABLISHMENT
2051-153962-0038 I CANNOT DESCRIBE ALL THAT TOOK PLACE IN THESE INNER PRECINCTS FOR A SINISTER LOOKING PERSON IN A BLACK GOWN CAME AND MADE UNPLEASANT GESTURES AT ME FOR PEEPING I HAPPENED TO HAVE IN MY POCKET ONE OF THE MUSICAL BANK PIECES WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN ME BY MISSUS NOSNIBOR
2051-153962-0039 SO I TRIED TO TIP HIM WITH IT BUT HAVING SEEN WHAT IT WAS HE BECAME SO ANGRY THAT I HAD TO GIVE HIM A PIECE OF THE OTHER KIND OF MONEY TO PACIFY HIM WHEN I HAD DONE THIS HE BECAME CIVIL DIRECTLY AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE I VENTURED TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK
2051-153962-0040 AND SAW ZULORA IN THE VERY ACT OF GIVING A PIECE OF PAPER WHICH LOOKED LIKE A CHEQUE TO ONE OF THE CASHIERS HE DID NOT EXAMINE IT BUT PUTTING HIS HAND INTO AN ANTIQUE COFFER HARD BY HE PULLED OUT A QUANTITY OF METAL PIECES APPARENTLY AT RANDOM
2051-153962-0041 AND HANDED THEM OVER WITHOUT COUNTING THEM NEITHER DID ZULORA COUNT THEM BUT PUT THEM INTO HER PURSE AND WENT BACK TO HER SEAT AFTER DROPPING A FEW PIECES OF THE OTHER COINAGE INTO AN ALMS BOX THAT STOOD BY THE CASHIER'S SIDE
2051-153962-0042 MISSUS NOSNIBOR AND AROWHENA THEN DID LIKEWISE BUT A LITTLE LATER THEY GAVE ALL SO FAR AS I COULD SEE THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED FROM THE CASHIER BACK TO A VERGER WHO I HAVE NO DOUBT
2051-153962-0043 PUT IT BACK INTO THE COFFER FROM WHICH IT HAD BEEN TAKEN THEY THEN BEGAN MAKING TOWARDS THE CURTAIN WHEREON I LET IT DROP AND RETREATED TO A REASONABLE DISTANCE
2051-153962-0044 BUT AT LAST I VENTURED TO REMARK THAT THE BANK WAS NOT SO BUSY TO DAY AS IT PROBABLY OFTEN WAS
2051-153962-0045 WHAT LITTLE HEED PEOPLE PAID TO THE MOST PRECIOUS OF ALL INSTITUTIONS I COULD SAY NOTHING IN REPLY BUT I HAVE EVER BEEN OF OPINION THAT THE GREATER PART OF MANKIND DO APPROXIMATELY KNOW WHERE THEY GET THAT WHICH DOES THEM GOOD
2051-153962-0046 THE HEART OF THE COUNTRY WAS THOROUGHLY DEVOTED TO THESE ESTABLISHMENTS AND ANY SIGN OF THEIR BEING IN DANGER WOULD BRING IN SUPPORT FROM THE MOST UNEXPECTED QUARTERS IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE PEOPLE KNEW THEM TO BE SO VERY SAFE
2051-153962-0047 MOREOVER THESE INSTITUTIONS NEVER DEPARTED FROM THE SAFEST AND MOST APPROVED BANKING PRINCIPLES THUS
2051-153962-0048 A THING NOW FREQUENTLY DONE BY CERTAIN BUBBLE COMPANIES WHICH BY DOING AN ILLEGITIMATE TRADE HAD DRAWN MANY CUSTOMERS AWAY AND EVEN THE SHAREHOLDERS WERE FEWER THAN FORMERLY OWING TO THE INNOVATIONS OF THESE UNSCRUPULOUS PERSONS
2051-153962-0049 AND AS IT WAS NOW ONLY TWO THOUSAND YEARS SINCE THERE HAD BEEN ONE OF THESE DISTRIBUTIONS PEOPLE FELT THAT THEY COULD NOT HOPE FOR ANOTHER IN THEIR OWN TIME AND PREFERRED INVESTMENTS WHEREBY THEY GOT SOME MORE TANGIBLE RETURN ALL WHICH SHE SAID
2051-153962-0050 WAS VERY MELANCHOLY TO THINK OF HAVING MADE THESE LAST ADMISSIONS SHE RETURNED TO HER ORIGINAL STATEMENT NAMELY THAT EVERY ONE IN THE COUNTRY REALLY SUPPORTED THESE BANKS AS TO THE FEWNESS OF THE PEOPLE
2051-153962-0051 AND THE ABSENCE OF THE ABLE BODIED SHE POINTED OUT TO ME WITH SOME JUSTICE THAT THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT WE OUGHT TO EXPECT
2051-153962-0052 MEN OF SCIENCE DOCTORS STATESMEN PAINTERS AND THE LIKE WERE JUST THOSE WHO WERE MOST LIKELY TO BE MISLED BY THEIR OWN FANCIED ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND TO BE MADE UNDULY SUSPICIOUS BY THEIR LICENTIOUS DESIRE FOR GREATER PRESENT RETURN
2051-153962-0053 WHICH WAS AT THE ROOT OF NINE TENTHS OF THE OPPOSITION BY THEIR VANITY WHICH WOULD PROMPT THEM TO AFFECT SUPERIORITY TO THE PREJUDICES OF THE VULGAR AND BY THE STINGS OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCE WHICH WAS CONSTANTLY UPBRAIDING THEM IN THE MOST CRUEL MANNER ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR BODIES
2051-153962-0054 WHICH WERE GENERALLY DISEASED LET A PERSON'S INTELLECT SHE CONTINUED BE NEVER SO SOUND UNLESS HIS BODY IS IN ABSOLUTE HEALTH HE CAN FORM NO JUDGEMENT WORTH HAVING ON MATTERS OF THIS KIND THE BODY IS EVERYTHING
2051-153962-0055 IT NEED NOT PERHAPS BE SUCH A STRONG BODY SHE SAID THIS BECAUSE SHE SAW THAT I WAS THINKING OF THE OLD AND INFIRM LOOKING FOLKS WHOM I HAD SEEN IN THE BANK BUT IT MUST BE IN PERFECT HEALTH IN THIS CASE THE LESS ACTIVE STRENGTH IT HAD
2051-153962-0056 THE MORE FREE WOULD BE THE WORKING OF THE INTELLECT AND THEREFORE THE SOUNDER THE CONCLUSION THE PEOPLE THEN WHOM I HAD SEEN AT THE BANK WERE IN REALITY THE VERY ONES WHOSE OPINIONS WERE MOST WORTH HAVING
2051-153962-0057 THEY DECLARED ITS ADVANTAGES TO BE INCALCULABLE AND EVEN PROFESSED TO CONSIDER THE IMMEDIATE RETURN TO BE FAR LARGER THAN THEY WERE ENTITLED TO AND SO SHE RAN ON
2051-153962-0058 SHE MIGHT SAY WHAT SHE PLEASED BUT HER MANNER CARRIED NO CONVICTION AND LATER ON I SAW SIGNS OF GENERAL INDIFFERENCE TO THESE BANKS THAT WERE NOT TO BE MISTAKEN
2051-153962-0059 BUT THE DENIAL WAS GENERALLY SO COUCHED AS TO ADD ANOTHER PROOF OF ITS EXISTENCE IN COMMERCIAL PANICS AND IN TIMES OF GENERAL DISTRESS
2051-153962-0060 A FEW MIGHT DO SO SOME FROM HABIT AND EARLY TRAINING SOME FROM THE INSTINCT THAT PROMPTS US TO CATCH AT ANY STRAW WHEN WE THINK OURSELVES DROWNING BUT FEW FROM A GENUINE BELIEF THAT THE MUSICAL BANKS COULD SAVE THEM FROM FINANCIAL RUIN
2051-153962-0061 IF THEY WERE UNABLE TO MEET THEIR ENGAGEMENTS IN THE OTHER KIND OF CURRENCY IN CONVERSATION WITH ONE OF THE MUSICAL BANK MANAGERS
2051-153962-0062 AND REPAIRED THE BUILDINGS AND ENLARGED THE ORGANS THE PRESIDENTS MOREOVER HAD TAKEN TO RIDING IN OMNIBUSES AND TALKING NICELY TO PEOPLE IN THE STREETS AND TO REMEMBERING THE AGES OF THEIR CHILDREN AND GIVING THEM THINGS WHEN THEY WERE NAUGHTY
2051-153962-0063 SO THAT ALL WOULD HENCEFORTH GO SMOOTHLY
2051-153962-0064 IT IS NOT NECESSARY HE REJOINED NOT IN THE LEAST NECESSARY I ASSURE YOU AND YET ANY ONE COULD SEE THAT THE MONEY GIVEN OUT AT THESE BANKS WAS NOT THAT WITH WHICH PEOPLE BOUGHT THEIR BREAD MEAT AND CLOTHING
2051-153962-0065 TOY MONEY OR THE COUNTERS USED FOR CERTAIN GAMES AT CARDS FOR NOTWITHSTANDING THE BEAUTY OF THE DESIGNS THE MATERIAL ON WHICH THEY WERE STAMPED WAS AS NEARLY VALUELESS AS POSSIBLE SOME WERE COVERED WITH TIN FOIL
2051-153962-0066 BUT THE GREATER PART WERE FRANKLY OF A CHEAP BASE METAL THE EXACT NATURE OF WHICH I WAS NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE INDEED THEY WERE MADE OF A GREAT VARIETY OF METALS OR PERHAPS MORE ACCURATELY ALLOYS SOME OF WHICH WERE HARD
2051-153962-0067 OF COURSE EVERY ONE KNEW THAT THEIR COMMERCIAL VALUE WAS NIL BUT ALL THOSE WHO WISHED TO BE CONSIDERED RESPECTABLE THOUGHT IT INCUMBENT UPON THEM TO RETAIN A FEW COINS IN THEIR POSSESSION
2051-153962-0068 AND TO LET THEM BE SEEN FROM TIME TO TIME IN THEIR HANDS AND PURSES NOT ONLY THIS BUT THEY WOULD STICK TO IT THAT THE CURRENT COIN OF THE REALM WAS DROSS IN COMPARISON WITH THE MUSICAL BANK COINAGE
2051-153962-0069 PERHAPS HOWEVER THE STRANGEST THING OF ALL WAS THAT THESE VERY PEOPLE WOULD AT TIMES MAKE FUN IN SMALL WAYS OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM INDEED THERE WAS HARDLY ANY INSINUATION AGAINST IT
2051-153962-0070 WHICH THEY WOULD NOT TOLERATE AND EVEN APPLAUD IN THEIR DAILY NEWSPAPERS IF WRITTEN ANONYMOUSLY WHILE IF THE SAME THING WERE SAID WITHOUT AMBIGUITY TO THEIR FACES
2051-153962-0071 AND DOUBT IMPOSSIBLE THEY WOULD CONSIDER THEMSELVES VERY SERIOUSLY AND JUSTLY OUTRAGED AND ACCUSE THE SPEAKER OF BEING UNWELL
2051-153962-0072 I NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND NEITHER CAN I QUITE DO SO NOW THOUGH I BEGIN TO SEE BETTER WHAT THEY MEAN WHY A SINGLE CURRENCY SHOULD NOT SUFFICE THEM IT WOULD SEEM TO ME AS THOUGH ALL THEIR DEALINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN THUS GREATLY SIMPLIFIED
2051-153962-0073 EVEN THOSE WHO TO MY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE KEPT ONLY JUST ENOUGH MONEY AT THE MUSICAL BANKS TO SWEAR BY WOULD CALL THE OTHER BANKS WHERE THEIR SECURITIES REALLY LAY COLD DEADENING PARALYSING AND THE LIKE
2051-153962-0074 I NOTICED ANOTHER THING MOREOVER WHICH STRUCK ME GREATLY I WAS TAKEN TO THE OPENING OF ONE OF THESE BANKS IN A NEIGHBOURING TOWN AND SAW A LARGE ASSEMBLAGE OF CASHIERS AND MANAGERS I SAT OPPOSITE THEM AND SCANNED THEIR FACES ATTENTIVELY
2051-153962-0075 THEY DID NOT PLEASE ME THEY LACKED WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS THE TRUE EREWHONIAN FRANKNESS AND AN EQUAL NUMBER FROM ANY OTHER CLASS WOULD HAVE LOOKED HAPPIER AND BETTER MEN WHEN I MET THEM IN THE STREETS THEY DID NOT SEEM LIKE OTHER PEOPLE BUT HAD
2051-153962-0076 AS A GENERAL RULE A CRAMPED EXPRESSION UPON THEIR FACES WHICH PAINED AND DEPRESSED ME THOSE WHO CAME FROM THE COUNTRY WERE BETTER THEY SEEMED TO HAVE LIVED LESS AS A SEPARATE CLASS AND TO BE FREER AND HEALTHIER
2051-153962-0077 BUT IN SPITE OF MY SEEING NOT A FEW WHOSE LOOKS WERE BENIGN AND NOBLE I COULD NOT HELP ASKING MYSELF CONCERNING THE GREATER NUMBER OF THOSE WHOM I MET WHETHER EREWHON WOULD BE A BETTER COUNTRY IF THEIR EXPRESSION WERE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL
2051-153962-0078 I ANSWERED MYSELF EMPHATICALLY NO THE EXPRESSION ON THE FACES OF THE HIGH YDGRUNITES WAS THAT WHICH ONE WOULD WISH TO DIFFUSE AND NOT THAT OF THE CASHIERS A MAN'S EXPRESSION IS HIS SACRAMENT
2051-153962-0079 IT IS THE OUTWARD AND VISIBLE SIGN OF HIS INWARD AND SPIRITUAL GRACE OR WANT OF GRACE
2051-153962-0080 THAT THERE MUST BE A SOMETHING IN THEIR LIVES WHICH HAD STUNTED THEIR NATURAL DEVELOPMENT AND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE HEALTHILY MINDED IN ANY OTHER PROFESSION I WAS ALWAYS SORRY FOR THEM FOR IN NINE CASES OUT OF TEN
2051-153962-0081 THEY WERE WELL MEANING PERSONS THEY WERE IN THE MAIN VERY POORLY PAID THEIR CONSTITUTIONS WERE AS A RULE ABOVE SUSPICION AND THERE WERE RECORDED NUMBERLESS INSTANCES OF THEIR SELF SACRIFICE AND GENEROSITY
2051-153962-0082 AT AN AGE FOR THE MOST PART WHEN THEIR JUDGEMENT WAS NOT MATURED AND AFTER HAVING BEEN KEPT IN STUDIED IGNORANCE OF THE REAL DIFFICULTIES OF THE SYSTEM BUT THIS DID NOT MAKE THEIR POSITION THE LESS A FALSE ONE
2051-153962-0083 FEW PEOPLE WOULD SPEAK QUITE OPENLY AND FREELY BEFORE THEM WHICH STRUCK ME AS A VERY BAD SIGN
2051-153962-0084 WHEN THEY WERE IN THE ROOM EVERY ONE WOULD TALK AS THOUGH ALL CURRENCY SAVE THAT OF THE MUSICAL BANKS SHOULD BE ABOLISHED AND YET THEY KNEW PERFECTLY WELL
2051-153962-0085 IT WAS EXPECTED OF THEM THAT THEY SHOULD APPEAR TO DO SO BUT THIS WAS ALL THE LESS THOUGHTFUL OF THEM DID NOT SEEM PARTICULARLY UNHAPPY BUT MANY WERE PLAINLY SICK AT HEART THOUGH PERHAPS THEY HARDLY KNEW IT
2051-153962-0086 SOME FEW WERE OPPONENTS OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM BUT THESE WERE LIABLE TO BE DISMISSED FROM THEIR EMPLOYMENT AT ANY MOMENT AND THIS RENDERED THEM VERY CAREFUL FOR A MAN WHO HAD ONCE BEEN CASHIER AT A MUSICAL BANK WAS OUT OF THE FIELD FOR OTHER EMPLOYMENT
2051-153962-0087 AND WAS GENERALLY UNFITTED FOR IT BY REASON OF THAT COURSE OF TREATMENT WHICH WAS COMMONLY CALLED HIS EDUCATION IN FACT IT WAS A CAREER FROM WHICH RETREAT WAS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE
2051-153962-0088 AND INTO WHICH YOUNG MEN WERE GENERALLY INDUCED TO ENTER BEFORE THEY COULD BE REASONABLY EXPECTED CONSIDERING THEIR TRAINING TO HAVE FORMED ANY OPINIONS OF THEIR OWN NOT UNFREQUENTLY INDEED THEY WERE INDUCED BY WHAT WE IN ENGLAND SHOULD CALL
2051-153962-0089 UNDUE INFLUENCE CONCEALMENT AND FRAUD FEW INDEED WERE THOSE WHO HAD THE COURAGE TO INSIST ON SEEING BOTH SIDES OF THE QUESTION BEFORE THEY COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO WHAT WAS PRACTICALLY A LEAP IN THE DARK
2051-153962-0090 ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT AN HONOURABLE MAN WOULD TEACH HIS BOY TO UNDERSTAND BUT IN PRACTICE IT WAS NOT SO
2051-153962-0091 THAT SOME ONE OF THEIR SONS PERHAPS A MERE CHILD SHOULD FILL IT THERE WAS THE LAD HIMSELF GROWING UP WITH EVERY PROMISE OF BECOMING A GOOD AND HONOURABLE MAN BUT UTTERLY WITHOUT WARNING CONCERNING THE IRON SHOE WHICH HIS NATURAL PROTECTOR WAS PROVIDING FOR HIM
2051-153962-0092 WHO COULD SAY THAT THE WHOLE THING WOULD NOT END IN A LIFE LONG LIE AND VAIN CHAFING TO ESCAPE I CONFESS THAT THERE WERE FEW THINGS IN EREWHON WHICH SHOCKED ME MORE THAN THIS
2051-153962-0093 YET WE DO SOMETHING NOT SO VERY DIFFERENT FROM THIS EVEN IN ENGLAND AND AS REGARDS THE DUAL COMMERCIAL SYSTEM ALL COUNTRIES HAVE AND HAVE HAD A LAW OF THE LAND AND ALSO ANOTHER LAW WHICH THOUGH PROFESSEDLY MORE SACRED
2051-153962-0094 IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE NEED FOR SOME LAW OVER AND ABOVE
2051-153962-0095 INDEED IT IS HARD TO THINK THAT MAN COULD EVER HAVE BECOME MAN AT ALL BUT FOR THE GRADUAL EVOLUTION OF A PERCEPTION THAT THOUGH THIS WORLD LOOMS SO LARGE WHEN WE ARE IN IT IT MAY SEEM A LITTLE THING WHEN WE HAVE GOT AWAY FROM IT
2051-153962-0096 WHEN MAN HAD GROWN TO THE PERCEPTION THAT IN THE EVERLASTING IS AND IS NOT OF NATURE THE WORLD AND ALL THAT IT CONTAINS INCLUDING MAN IS AT THE SAME TIME BOTH SEEN AND UNSEEN
2051-153962-0097 HE FELT THE NEED OF TWO RULES OF LIFE ONE FOR THE SEEN AND THE OTHER FOR THE UNSEEN SIDE OF THINGS FOR THE LAWS AFFECTING THE SEEN WORLD HE CLAIMED THE SANCTION OF SEEN POWERS FOR THE UNSEEN
2051-153962-0098 OF WHICH HE KNOWS NOTHING SAVE THAT IT EXISTS AND IS POWERFUL HE APPEALED TO THE UNSEEN POWER OF WHICH AGAIN HE KNOWS NOTHING SAVE THAT IT EXISTS AND IS POWERFUL
2051-153962-0099 SOME EREWHONIAN OPINIONS CONCERNING THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE UNBORN EMBRYO THAT I REGRET MY SPACE WILL NOT PERMIT ME TO LAY BEFORE THE READER HAVE LED ME TO CONCLUDE
2051-153962-0100 THAT THE EREWHONIAN MUSICAL BANKS AND PERHAPS THE RELIGIOUS SYSTEMS OF ALL COUNTRIES ARE NOW MORE OR LESS OF AN ATTEMPT
2051-153962-0101 OF MILLIONS OF PAST GENERATIONS AGAINST THE COMPARATIVELY SHALLOW CONSCIOUSLY REASONING AND EPHEMERAL CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THAT OF THE LAST THIRTY OR FORTY THE SAVING FEATURE
2051-153962-0102 OF THE EREWHONIAN MUSICAL BANK SYSTEM
2051-153962-0103 AND ON WHICH I WILL TOUCH LATER WAS THAT WHILE IT BORE WITNESS TO THE EXISTENCE OF A KINGDOM THAT IS NOT OF THIS WORLD IT MADE NO ATTEMPT TO PIERCE THE VEIL THAT HIDES IT FROM HUMAN EYES
2051-153962-0104 IT IS HERE THAT ALMOST ALL RELIGIONS GO WRONG THEIR PRIESTS TRY TO MAKE US BELIEVE THAT THEY KNOW MORE ABOUT THE UNSEEN WORLD THAN THOSE WHOSE EYES ARE STILL BLINDED BY THE SEEN CAN EVER KNOW
2051-153962-0105 FORGETTING THAT WHILE TO DENY THE EXISTENCE OF AN UNSEEN KINGDOM IS BAD
2051-153962-0106 THAT IN SPITE OF THE SAVING FEATURE OF WHICH I HAVE JUST SPOKEN I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT THE EREWHONIANS ARE ON THE EVE OF SOME GREAT CHANGE IN THEIR RELIGIOUS OPINIONS OR AT ANY RATE
2051-153962-0107 SO FAR AS I COULD SEE FULLY NINETY PER CENT OF THE POPULATION OF THE METROPOLIS LOOKED UPON THESE BANKS WITH SOMETHING NOT FAR REMOVED FROM CONTEMPT
