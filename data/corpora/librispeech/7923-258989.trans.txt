7923-258989-0000 IN A BROAD SENSE A CRISIS IS A DECISIVE MOMENT OR TURNING POINT HENCE IN INDUSTRY A COLLAPSE OF PROSPERITY IN THE COURSE OF A FEVER THE CRISIS IS THE POINT WHERE THERE IS A TURN FOR THE BETTER OR FOR THE WORSE
7923-258989-0001 THE FIGURE OF SPEECH AS APPLIED TO INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS WOULD SEEM TO FAIL IN THAT WHAT PRECEDES IS APPARENTLY EXUBERANT HEALTH NOT DISEASE BUSINESS CONDITIONS DO NOT MOVE ALONG UNIFORMLY THERE ARE WAVES OF PROSPERITY
7923-258989-0002 PROFITS ARE APPARENTLY GREAT THEN MAY BE SUDDENLY SWEPT AWAY THE PROFITS OF THE PROSPEROUS TIME ARE PARTLY ILLUSORY OR EXIST ONLY ON PAPER
7923-258989-0003 THE SITUATION HAS ALL THE UNHEALTHINESS OF THE FEVER PATIENT MEN TRADE IN PROMISES AND WHEN THE CRISIS COMES THEY HAVE ONLY PROMISES FOR PROFITS
7923-258989-0004 THE DISCUSSION OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND PROFITS IS NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT A CONSIDERATION OF THIS RHYTHMIC MOVEMENT OF CONFIDENCE AND PRICES A CRISIS IN THE BUSINESS AFFAIRS OF AN INDIVIDUAL IN THE SENSE OF A COLLAPSE OF PROSPERITY MAY OCCUR FROM MANY MISCHANCES
7923-258989-0005 A LOCAL CRISIS MAY BE FELT IN SOME ONE NEIGHBORHOOD AS A RESULT OF FLOOD OF FIRE OR OF OTHER ACCIDENTS SUCH A CASE WAS THAT WHICH OCCURRED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR IN MANCHESTER ENGLAND
7923-258989-0006 WHEN THE COTTON FACTORIES WERE COMPELLED TO CLOSE BECAUSE THE SUPPLY OF COTTON WAS CUT OFF BY THE BLOCKADE OF THE PORTS OF THE SOUTH IN THE CIVIL WAR SUCH A LOCAL CRISIS SOMETIMES RESULTS FROM A CHANGE OF TRANSPORTATION THROWING A TOWN OUT OF THE LINE OF TRADE
7923-258989-0007 THESE HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IN DISCUSSING CHANCE AND RISK BUT THE PHENOMENON KNOWN GENERALLY AS AN INDUSTRIAL CRISIS IS OF WIDER EXTENT
7923-258989-0008 TWO IN A MORE SPECIAL SENSE A FINANCIAL CRISIS IS THE CONFUSION AND LOSS THAT MARK THE END OF A PERIOD OF RISING PRICES AN INDUSTRIAL DEPRESSION IS THE PERIOD OF HARD TIMES THAT FOLLOWS THE WORD CRISIS SUGGESTS A BRIEF PERIOD
7923-258989-0009 A MOMENT SOMETHING THAT IS SEVERE SUDDEN AND SOON OVER THE TERM FINANCIAL PANIC IS FREQUENTLY USED AS A SYNONYM FOR FINANCIAL CRISIS A CRISIS IN THE NARROWER SENSE HAS TO DO WITH PRICES
7923-258989-0010 IS ALWAYS CONNECTED WITH MONEY IN SOME WAY WHILE THEREFORE CRISES MAY BE DIVIDED INTO INDUSTRIAL SPECULATIVE AND FINANCIAL ACCORDING TO THEIR IMMEDIATE OCCASION ALL OF THEM ARE FINANCIAL IN THE SENSE THAT THEY HAVE TO DO WITH A CHANGE IN THE GENERAL PRICE LEVEL
7923-258989-0011 A CRISIS IS A JOLT TO PRICES WHICH SHATTERS THE CREDIT OF SOME BANKS BROKERS MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS
7923-258989-0012 INDUSTRY IN SUCCESSIVE DECADES DOES NOT PASS THROUGH AN UNVARYING SERIES OF CHANGES BUT HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF WITH SUFFICIENT REGULARITY TO JUSTIFY THE VIEW THAT A CERTAIN SERIES OF CHANGES IS TYPICAL IN MODERN INDUSTRY
7923-258989-0013 WHEN PRICES ARE AT THE LOWEST POINT MANY FACTORIES ARE CLOSED AND MUCH LABOR IS UNEMPLOYED CONDITIONS ARE WORSE IN SOME INDUSTRIES THAN IN OTHERS
7923-258989-0014 GENERAL ECONOMY AND GREAT CAUTION PREVAIL FEW NEW ENTERPRISES ARE UNDERTAKEN TO THOSE HAVING AVAILABLE MONEY THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO BUY AND PROPERTY BEGINS TO CHANGE HANDS THEN HOARDED MONEY BEGINS TO COME OUT OF ITS HIDING PLACES
7923-258989-0015 MONEY FLOWS IN FROM OTHER COUNTRIES PARTICULARLY IF BUSINESS CONDITIONS ARE BETTER ABROAD THAN HERE FOR LOW PRICES MAKE A COUNTRY A GOOD PLACE IN WHICH TO BUY AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE MONEY IN CIRCULATION THUS INCREASES
7923-258989-0016 THERE IS A GENERAL RETURN OF CONFIDENCE THAT INCREASES CREDIT NOT ONLY ARE THERE MORE DOLLARS BUT EACH DOES MORE WORK THEN OLD ENTERPRISES ARE RESUMED AND NEW ONES ARE UNDERTAKEN THE PURCHASE OF MATERIALS IN LARGER QUANTITIES CAUSES A RISE IN PRICES AND AN INCREASE IN COSTS
7923-258989-0017 THE SURPLUS LABOR ON THE MARGIN OF EFFICIENCY GETS EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES BEGIN TO INCREASE THE ONLY CLASSES NOT SHARING IN THIS IMPROVEMENT ARE THE RECEIVERS OF FIXED INCOMES
7923-258989-0018 FOUR THE CRISIS IS A MOMENT OF WIDESPREAD LOSS WHICH IS FOLLOWED BY A LONG PERIOD OF SMALL PROFITS TO MOST ENTERPRISES AND OF ENFORCED ECONOMY AS PRICES CEASE TO GO UP RAPIDLY THE QUESTION ARISES IN MANY MINDS WHETHER THE MOVEMENT CAN CONTINUE AND IF NOT
7923-258989-0019 WHEN IT WILL CEASE MEN WISH TO HOLD ON FOR THE LAST PROFITS AND ARE WILLING TO RISK SOMETHING TO GAIN THEM WHEN FOREIGN PRICES DO NOT RISE IN AS GREAT PROPORTION AS DOMESTIC PRICES FOREIGN IMPORTS ARE STIMULATED AND THE QUANTITY OF EXPORTS FALLS
7923-258989-0020 THIS DISTURBS THE EQUILIBRIUM OF MONEY AND REQUIRES AT LENGTH LARGE AND CONTINUED EXPORTATION OF SPECIE THIS CHECKS PRICES AND REDUCING THE SPECIE RESERVES OF THE BANKS COMPELS THEM TO BE MORE CAUTIOUS
7923-258989-0021 THE FALL IN THE VALUE OF MANY STOCKS AND SECURITIES HELD BY THE BANKS FORCES MANY BROKERS AND SPECULATORS TO CONVERT THEIR RESOURCES INTO READY MONEY THIS IS THE MOMENT OF DANGER WEAK ENTERPRISES FIND THEIR FOUNDATIONS CRUMBLING AND THERE ARE MANY FAILURES
7923-258989-0022 THE FALLING PRICES THE SHATTERED CREDIT AND THE FINANCIAL LOSSES FORCE MANY FACTORIES TO CLOSE MANY WORKMEN ARE THROWN OUT OF EMPLOYMENT AND BUSINESS MUST AGAIN ENTER UPON A PERIOD OF RETRENCHMENT FOR IT HAS COMPLETED THE CYCLE OF CHANGING PRICES
7923-258989-0023 ONE THE PERIODS OF INDUSTRIAL HARDSHIP IN THE MIDDLE AGES WERE CONNECTED WITH ADVERSE CONDITIONS OF PRODUCTION NOT WITH THE COLLAPSE OF PRICES PERIODS OF EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP IN MEDIEVAL TIMES WERE MOSTLY DUE TO POLITICAL OPPRESSION FAMINE
7923-258989-0024 WARS PESTILENCE AND SCOURGES OF NATURE THERE BEING VERY LITTLE OF THE MONEY ECONOMY THERE WAS NO DEVELOPMENT OF CREDIT AND OF CREDIT PRICES THE MONEY ECONOMY BEGAN AS HAS BEEN NOTED IN THE CITIES
7923-258989-0025 AS THE USE OF MONEY SPREAD AS LARGER COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES WERE UNDERTAKEN AS BORROWING AND THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST BECAME COMMON
7923-258989-0026 USUALLY BEING SEVERER IN ENGLAND THE ENGLISH CRISES MAY BE ROUGHLY DATED EIGHTEEN O THREE EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR
7923-258989-0027 EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE EIGHTEEN NINETY THESE WERE ATTRIBUTED TO VARIOUS CAUSES THAT OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE TO OVER TRADING ABROAD THAT OF EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN TO RAILROAD BUILDING
7923-258989-0028 THAT OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR TO THE INTERRUPTION OF THE COTTON TRADE AND OF COMMERCE AS A RESULT OF THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA WHILE IN MANY PARTS OF ENGLAND THE CRISIS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR WAS UNUSUALLY SEVERE IN OTHER COUNTRIES IT WAS OF LITTLE MOMENT
7923-258989-0029 GERMANY AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF GREAT SPECULATIVE PROSPERITY HAD A MOST SEVERE CRISIS IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WHILE FRANCE A SOMEWHAT SIGNIFICANT FACT ALTHOUGH PROSTRATED BY THE WAR OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVENTY ONE
7923-258989-0030 LOSING A LARGE AMOUNT OF WEALTH AND PAYING A THOUSAND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO GERMANY AS A WAR INDEMNITY
7923-258989-0031 THREE IN THE UNITED STATES THERE HAVE BEEN FIVE MARKED CRISES THE FIRST IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN
7923-258989-0032 THESE CRISES WERE OF DATE EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY NINE EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE
7923-258989-0033 MAJOR CRISES THUS OCCURRED ABOUT TWENTY YEARS APART AND MINOR CRISES IN SEVERAL INSTANCES ALTERNATED WITH THEM NOTABLY IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND WE MIGHT ADD NINETEEN O THREE
7923-258989-0034 THESE CRISES WERE THE CULMINATION OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF SPECULATION USUALLY SPOKEN OF AS THEIR CAUSES THE CRISIS OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN WAS DUE TO OVER TRADING AND TO THE IMMENSE IMPORTATION FOLLOWING THE WAR OF EIGHTEEN TWELVE
7923-258989-0035 AND THE RESUMPTION OF COMMERCE WITH EUROPE IN EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY NINE CAME IN QUICK SUCCESSION TWO CRISES NOT QUITE DISTINCT FROM EACH OTHER THE SECOND SIMILAR TO THE RELAPSE OF A FEVER PATIENT
7923-258989-0036 THE IMMEDIATE OCCASIONS WERE OVER SPECULATION IN LANDS A GREAT ISSUE OF BANK MONEY NATIONAL EXPANSION AND OVER CONFIDENCE POSSIBLY IN SOME DEGREE THE HEEDLESS FINANCIAL MEASURES OF ANDREW JACKSON
7923-258989-0037 THE CRISIS OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN FOLLOWED A PERIOD OF GREAT PROSPERITY MARKED BY THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD IN CALIFORNIA IN EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT BY GREAT EXPANSION OF COMMERCE BY THE BUILDING OF RAILROADS AND BY A GREAT INCREASE IN FOREIGN TRADE
7923-258989-0038 THE CRISIS OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE PROBABLY THE SEVEREST IN OUR HISTORY IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GREAT SPECULATION ESPECIALLY TO RAILROAD BUILDING ON AN UNEXAMPLED SCALE FOLLOWING THE WAR THE BLOW WHEN IT FELL
7923-258989-0039 WAS INTENSIFIED BY THE CONTRACTION OF CURRENCY LEADING TO THE RETURN TO A SPECIE BASIS AND LOWER PRICES THE CRISIS OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR A COMPARATIVELY SLIGHT ONE OCCASIONED RATHER THAN CAUSED BY THE DISCUSSION OF THE MONEY QUESTION
7923-258989-0040 WAS FOLLOWED BY SOME YEARS OF NOTICEABLE DEPRESSION THE YEARS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE TO EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO WITNESSED A PROSPERITY THAT CULMINATED IN A CRISIS IN SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE LIKEWISE GENERALLY EXPLAINED AS DUE TO THE UNSETTLED STATE OF OUR MONETARY SYSTEM
7923-258989-0041 FOLLOWED BY A PERIOD OF DEPRESSION LASTING UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN THE PERIOD FROM EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN TO NINETEEN O THREE HAS BEEN MARKED BY GREAT PROSPERITY AND BY RISING PRICES
7923-258989-0042 HIGH PRICES HAVE GREATLY CHECKED BUILDING
