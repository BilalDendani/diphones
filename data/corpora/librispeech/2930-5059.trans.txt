2930-5059-0000 MUCH LESS WAS I ABLE IN MY OWN STRENGTH BUT LIKE A BARBARIAN HAVE I MURDERED AND DEFILED THE LANGUAGE OF OTHERS
2930-5059-0001 AND I WAS INDIGNANT THAT THE NAME OF MY OWN PEOPLE FORMERLY FAMOUS AND DISTINGUISHED SHOULD SINK INTO OBLIVION AND LIKE SMOKE BE DISSIPATED
2930-5059-0002 THAN NOBODY ALTHOUGH SO MANY ARE TO BE FOUND WHO MIGHT MUCH MORE SATISFACTORILY DISCHARGE THE LABOUR THUS IMPOSED ON ME I HUMBLY ENTREAT MY READERS WHOSE EARS I MAY OFFEND BY THE INELEGANCE OF MY WORDS
2930-5059-0003 FOR ZEALOUS EFFORTS VERY OFTEN FAIL BUT BOLD ENTHUSIASM WERE IT IN ITS POWER WOULD NOT SUFFER ME TO FAIL MAY THEREFORE CANDOUR BE SHOWN WHERE THE INELEGANCE OF MY WORDS IS INSUFFICIENT
2930-5059-0004 AND MAY THE TRUTH OF THIS HISTORY WHICH MY RUSTIC TONGUE HAS VENTURED AS A KIND OF PLOUGH TO TRACE OUT IN FURROWS LOSE NONE OF ITS INFLUENCE FROM THAT CAUSE
2930-5059-0005 FOR IT IS BETTER TO DRINK A WHOLESOME DRAUGHT OF TRUTH FROM THE HUMBLE VESSEL
2930-5059-0006 TO WINNOW MY CHAFF AND LAY UP THE WHEAT IN THE STOREHOUSE OF YOUR MEMORY FOR TRUTH REGARDS NOT WHO IS THE SPEAKER NOR IN WHAT MANNER IT IS SPOKEN BUT THAT THE THING BE TRUE AND SHE DOES NOT DESPISE THE JEWEL WHICH SHE HAS RESCUED FROM THE MUD
2930-5059-0007 WHO KINDLED WITH GENEROUS ARDOUR HAVE ENDEAVOURED BY ROMAN ELOQUENCE TO SMOOTH THE JARRING ELEMENTS OF THEIR TONGUE IF THEY HAVE LEFT UNSHAKEN ANY PILLAR OF HISTORY WHICH I WISHED TO SEE REMAIN THIS HISTORY THEREFORE HAS BEEN COMPILED FROM A WISH TO BENEFIT MY INFERIORS
2930-5059-0008 OF OUR LORD'S INCARNATION AND IN THE TWENTY FOURTH YEAR OF MERVIN
2930-5059-0009 THAT THE PRAYERS OF MY BETTERS WILL BE OFFERED UP FOR ME IN RECOMPENCE OF MY LABOUR
2930-5059-0010 HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO WRITE SOME EXTRACTS WHICH THE DULNESS OF THE BRITISH NATION HAD CAST AWAY BECAUSE TEACHERS HAD NO KNOWLEDGE NOR GAVE ANY INFORMATION IN THEIR BOOKS ABOUT THIS ISLAND OF BRITAIN BUT I HAVE GOT TOGETHER ALL THAT I COULD FIND
2930-5059-0011 AS FROM THE CHRONICLES OF THE SACRED FATHERS HIERONYMUS EUSEBIUS
2930-5059-0012 AND FROM OUR ANCIENT TRADITIONS MANY TEACHERS AND SCRIBES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO WRITE THIS BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER HAVE ABANDONED IT FROM ITS DIFFICULTY
2930-5059-0013 I PRAY THAT EVERY READER WHO SHALL READ THIS BOOK MAY PARDON ME FOR HAVING ATTEMPTED LIKE A CHATTERING JAY OR LIKE SOME WEAK WITNESS TO WRITE THESE THINGS AFTER THEY HAD FAILED
