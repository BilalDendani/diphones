2624-88360-0000 THE STAGE IS DEPENDENT UPON THREE LINES OF TRADITION FIRST THAT OF GREECE AND ROME THAT CAME DOWN THROUGH THE FRENCH SECOND THE ENGLISH STYLE RIPENED FROM THE MIRACLE PLAY AND THE SHAKESPEARIAN STAGE AND THIRD THE IBSEN PRECEDENT FROM NORWAY
2624-88360-0001 NOW SO FIRMLY ESTABLISHED IT IS CLASSIC THESE METHODS ARE OBSCURED BY THE COMMERCIALIZED DRAMAS BUT THEY ARE BEHIND THEM ALL LET US DISCUSS FOR ILLUSTRATION THE IBSEN TRADITION IBSEN IS GENERALLY THE VITRIOLIC FOE OF PAGEANT
2624-88360-0002 HE MUST BE READ ALOUD HE STANDS FOR THE SPOKEN WORD FOR THE IRON POWER OF LIFE THAT MAY BE CONCENTRATED IN A PHRASE LIKE THE ALL OR NOTHING OF BRAND THOUGH PEER GYNT HAS ITS SPECTACULAR SIDE IBSEN GENERALLY COMES IN THROUGH THE EAR ALONE
2624-88360-0003 HE CAN BE ACTED IN ESSENTIALS FROM END TO END WITH ONE TABLE AND FOUR CHAIRS IN ANY PARLOR THE ALLEGED PUNCH WITH WHICH THE MOVIE CULMINATES HAS OCCURRED THREE OR TEN YEARS BEFORE THE IBSEN CURTAIN GOES UP
2624-88360-0004 AT THE CLOSE OF EVERY ACT OF THE DRAMAS OF THIS NORWEGIAN ONE MIGHT INSCRIBE ON THE CURTAIN THIS THE MAGNIFICENT MOVING PICTURE CANNOT ACHIEVE LIKEWISE AFTER EVERY SUCCESSFUL FILM DESCRIBED IN THIS BOOK
2624-88360-0005 COULD BE INSCRIBED THIS THE TRENCHANT IBSEN CANNOT DO BUT A PHOTOPLAY OF GHOSTS CAME TO OUR TOWN THE HUMOR OF THE PROSPECT WAS THE SORT TOO DEEP FOR TEARS MY PASTOR AND I
2624-88360-0006 THAT WE MIGHT BE ALERT FOR EVERY ANTITHESIS TOGETHER WE WENT TO THE SERVICES SINCE THEN THE FILM HAS BEEN FURIOUSLY DENOUNCED BY THE LITERATI FLOYD DELL'S DISCRIMINATING ASSAULT UPON IT IS QUOTED IN CURRENT OPINION OCTOBER NINETEEN FIFTEEN
2624-88360-0007 AND MARGARET ANDERSON PRINTS A DENUNCIATION OF IT IN A RECENT NUMBER OF THE LITTLE REVIEW
2624-88360-0008 IT IS NOT IBSEN IT SHOULD BE ADVERTISED THE INIQUITIES OF THE FATHERS AN AMERICAN DRAMA OF EUGENICS IN A PALATIAL SETTING HENRY WALTHALL AS ALVING AFTERWARD AS HIS SON
2624-88360-0009 SHOWS THE MEN MUCH AS IBSEN OUTLINES THEIR CHARACTERS OF COURSE THE ONLY WAY TO BE IBSEN IS TO BE SO PRECISELY IN THE NEW PLOT ALL IS OPEN AS THE DAY
2624-88360-0010 THE WORLD IS WELCOME AND GENERALLY PRESENT WHEN THE MAN OR HIS SON GO FORTH TO SEE THE ELEPHANT AND HEAR THE OWL PROVINCIAL HYPOCRISY IS NOT IMPLIED
2624-88360-0011 FOR HIS HUMAN VOLCANOES TO BURST THROUGH IN THE END MARY ALDEN AS MISSUS ALVING SHOWS IN HER INTELLIGENT AND SENSITIVE COUNTENANCE THAT SHE HAS A CONCEPTION OF THAT CHARACTER SHE DOES NOT ALWAYS HAVE THE CHANCE TO ACT THE WOMAN WRITTEN IN HER FACE
2624-88360-0012 THE TART THINKING HANDSOME CREATURE THAT IBSEN PREFERS NIGEL DEBRULLIER LOOKS THE BUTTONED UP PASTOR MANDERS EVEN TO CARICATURE BUT THE CRAWLING BOOTLICKING CARPENTER JACOB ENGSTRAND IS CHANGED INTO A RESPECTABLE GUILELESS MAN WITH AN INCOME
2624-88360-0013 AND HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER ARE HELPLESS CONVENTIONAL UPPER CLASS RABBITS THEY DO NOT REMIND ONE OF THE SAUCY ORIGINALS THE ORIGINAL IBSEN DRAMA IS THE RESULT OF MIXING UP FIVE PARTICULAR CHARACTERS THROUGH THREE ACTS
2624-88360-0014 THERE IS NOT A SITUATION BUT WOULD GO TO PIECES IF ONE PERSONALITY WERE ALTERED HERE ARE TWO SADLY TAMPERED WITH ENGSTRAND AND HIS DAUGHTER HERE IS THE MOTHER WHO IS ONLY REFERRED TO IN IBSEN
2624-88360-0015 HERE IS THE ELDER ALVING WHO DISAPPEARS BEFORE THE ORIGINAL PLAY STARTS SO THE TWENTY GREAT IBSEN SITUATIONS IN THE STAGE PRODUCTION ARE GONE ONE NEW CRISIS HAS AN IBSEN IRONY AND PSYCHIC TENSION
2624-88360-0016 THE BOY IS TAKEN WITH THE DREADED INTERMITTENT PAINS IN THE BACK OF HIS HEAD HE IS PAINTING THE ORDER THAT IS TO MAKE HIM FAMOUS THE KING'S PORTRAIT WHILE THE ROOM EMPTIES OF PEOPLE HE WRITHES ON THE FLOOR
2624-88360-0017 BUT THE THING IS REITERATED IN TABLEAU SYMBOL HE IS LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN TERROR A HAIRY ARM WITH CLUTCHING DEMON CLAWS COMES THRUSTING IN TOWARD THE BACK OF HIS NECK HE WRITHES IN DEADLY FEAR THE AUDIENCE
2624-88360-0018 IS APPALLED FOR HIM THIS VISIBLE CLUTCH OF HEREDITY IS THE NEAREST EQUIVALENT THAT IS OFFERED FOR THE WHISPERED REFRAIN GHOSTS IN THE ORIGINAL MASTERPIECE THIS HAND SHOULD
2624-88360-0019 ALSO BE REITERATED AS A REFRAIN THREE TIMES AT LEAST BEFORE THIS TABLEAU EACH TIME MORE DREADFUL AND THREATENING IT APPEARS BUT THE ONCE AND HAS NO CHANCE TO BECOME A PART OF THE ACCEPTED HIEROGLYPHICS OF THE PIECE AS IT SHOULD BE
2624-88360-0020 TO REALIZE ITS FULL POWER THE FATHER'S PREVIOUS SINS HAVE BEEN ACTED OUT THE BOY'S CONSEQUENT STRUGGLE WITH THE MALADY HAS BEEN TRACED STEP BY STEP SO THE PLAY SHOULD END HERE IT WOULD THEN BE A ROUGH EQUIVALENT OF THE IBSEN IRONY IN A CONTRARY MEDIUM
2624-88360-0021 MOTION PICTURE PUNCH WHEN THE DOCTOR IS THE GOD FROM THE MACHINE THERE IS NO DOCTOR ON THE STAGE IN THE ORIGINAL GHOSTS BUT THERE IS A PHYSICIAN IN THE DOLL'S HOUSE A SCIENTIFIC QUIETLY MOVING ORACLE CRISP SPARTAN SOPHISTICATED
2624-88360-0022 IS THIS PHOTOPLAY PHYSICIAN SUCH A ONE THE BOY AND HIS HALF SISTER ARE IN THEIR WEDDING CLOTHES IN THE BIG CHURCH PASTOR MANDERS IS SAYING THE CEREMONY THE AUDIENCE AND BUILDING ARE INDEED SHOWY
2624-88360-0023 THE DOCTOR CHARGES UP THE AISLE AT THE MOMENT PEOPLE ARE TOLD TO SPEAK OR FOREVER HOLD THEIR PEACE HE HAS TACT HE SIMPLY BREAKS UP THE MARRIAGE RIGHT THERE HE DOES NOT TELL THE GUESTS WHY BUT HE TAKES THE WEDDING PARTY INTO THE PASTOR'S STUDY
2624-88360-0024 ALWAYS AN OROTUND MAN HE HAS THE CHAUTAUQUA MANNER INDEED IN THIS EXIGENCY HE BRINGS TO ONE'S MIND THE TEARFUL BOOK MUCH LOVED IN CHILDHOOD PARTED AT THE ALTAR OR WHY WAS IT THUS
2624-88360-0025 AND FOUR ABLE ACTORS HAVE THE TASK OF TELLING THE AUDIENCE BY FACIAL EXPRESSION ONLY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY MORAL LIGHTNING THEY STAND IN A ROW FACING THE PEOPLE ENDEAVORING TO MAKE THE CRISIS OF AN ALLEGED IBSEN PLAY OUT OF A CRASHING MELODRAMA
2624-88360-0026 WHEREVER IN GHOSTS WE HAVE QUIET VOICES THAT ARE LIKE THE SLOW DRIP OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID IN THE PHOTOPLAY WE HAVE NO QUIET GESTURES THAT WILL DO TRENCHANT WORK INSTEAD
2624-88360-0027 THERE ARE ENDLESS WRITHINGS AND RUSHINGS ABOUT DONE WITH A DEAL OF SKILL BUT DESTRUCTIVE OF THE LAST REMNANTS OF IBSEN UP PAST THE POINT OF THE CLUTCHING HAND THIS FILM IS THE PRIME EXAMPLE FOR STUDY FOR THE PERSON WHO WOULD KNOW ONCE FOR ALL
2624-88360-0028 THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PHOTOPLAYS AND THE STAGE DRAMAS ALONG WITH IT MIGHT BE CLASSED MISSUS FISKE'S DECORATIVE MOVING PICTURE TESS IN WHICH THERE IS EVERY DETERMINATION TO CONVEY THE ORIGINAL MISSUS FISKE ILLUSION WITHOUT HER VOICE AND BREATHING PRESENCE
2624-88360-0029 TO PEOPLE WHO KNOW HER WELL IT IS A SURPRISINGLY GOOD TINTYPE OF OUR BELOVED FRIEND FOR THE FAMILY ALBUM THE RELENTLESS THOMAS HARDY IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND THERE ARE TWO MOMENTS OF DRAMATIC LIFE SET AMONG MANY OF DELICIOUS PICTORIAL QUALITY
2624-88360-0030 WHEN TESS BAPTIZES HER CHILD AND WHEN SHE SMOOTHS ITS LITTLE GRAVE WITH A WAVERING HAND BUT IN THE STAGE VERSION THE DRAMATIC POIGNANCY BEGINS WITH THE GOING UP OF THE CURTAIN AND LASTS TILL IT DESCENDS THE PRIME EXAMPLE OF COMPLETE FAILURE
2624-88360-0031 IS SARAH BERNHARDT'S CAMILLE IT IS INDEED A TINTYPE OF THE CONSUMPTIVE HEROINE WITH EVERY GROUP ENTIRE AND TAKEN AT FULL LENGTH MUCH SPACE IS OCCUPIED BY THE FLOOR AND THE OVERHEAD PORTIONS OF THE STAGE SETTING IT LASTS AS LONG AS WOULD THE SPOKEN PERFORMANCE
2624-88360-0032 AND WHEREVER THERE IS A DIALOGUE WE MUST IMAGINE SAID CONVERSATION IF WE CAN IT MIGHT BE COMPARED TO WATCHING CAMILLE FROM THE TOP GALLERY THROUGH SMOKED GLASS WITH ONE'S EARS STOPPED WITH COTTON
2624-88360-0033 IT WOULD BE WELL FOR THE BEGINNING STUDENT TO FIND SOME WAY TO SEE THE FIRST TWO OF THESE THREE OR SOME OTHER ATTEMPTS TO REVAMP THE CLASSIC FOR INSTANCE MISSUS FISKE'S PAINSTAKING REPRODUCTION OF VANITY FAIR
2624-88360-0034 BEARING IN MIND THE LIST OF DIFFERENCES WHICH THIS CHAPTER NOW FURNISHES THERE IS NO DENYING THAT MANY STAGE MANAGERS WHO HAVE TAKEN UP PHOTOPLAYS ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE SHAKESPEARIAN FRENCH AND NORWEGIAN TRADITIONS IN THE NEW MEDIUM
2624-88360-0035 MANY OF THE MOVING PICTURES DISCUSSED IN THIS BOOK ARE REWRITTEN STAGE DRAMAS AND ONE JUDITH OF BETHULIA IS A PRONOUNCED SUCCESS BUT IN ORDER TO BE REAL PHOTOPLAYS THE STAGE DRAMAS MUST BE OVERHAULED INDEED TURNED INSIDE OUT AND UPSIDE DOWN
2624-88360-0036 THE SUCCESSFUL MOTION PICTURE EXPRESSES ITSELF THROUGH MECHANICAL DEVICES THAT ARE BEING EVOLVED EVERY HOUR UPON THOSE MANY NEW BITS OF MACHINERY ARE FOUNDED NOVEL METHODS OF COMBINATION IN ANOTHER FIELD OF LOGIC NOT DRAMATIC LOGIC BUT TABLEAU LOGIC BUT THE OLD LINE MANAGERS
2624-88360-0037 TAKING UP PHOTOPLAYS BEGIN BY MAKING CURIOUS MINIATURES OF STAGE PRESENTATIONS THEY TRY TO HAVE MOST THINGS AS BEFORE LATER THEY TAKE ON THE MOVING PICTURE TECHNIQUE IN A SUPERFICIAL WAY BUT THEY AND THE HOST OF TALENTED ACTORS IN THE PRIME OF LIFE AND BROADWAY SUCCESS
2624-88360-0038 RETAIN THE DRAMATIC STATE OF MIND IT IS A PRINCIPLE OF CRITICISM THE WORLD OVER THAT THE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THE ARTS MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED EVEN BY THOSE WHO AFTERWARDS MIX THOSE ARTS
2624-88360-0039 TAKE FOR INSTANCE THE PERPETUAL QUARREL BETWEEN THE ARTISTS AND THE HALF EDUCATED ABOUT LITERARY PAINTING WHISTLER FOUGHT THAT BATTLE IN ENGLAND HE TRIED TO BEAT IT INTO THE HEAD OF JOHN BULL THAT A PAINTING IS ONE THING A MERE ILLUSTRATION FOR A STORY ANOTHER THING
2624-88360-0040 BUT THE NOVICE IS ALWAYS STUBBORN TO HIM HINDU AND ARABIC ARE BOTH FOREIGN LANGUAGES THEREFORE JUST ALIKE THE BOOK ILLUSTRATION MAY BE SAID TO COME IN THROUGH THE EAR BY READING THE TITLE ALOUD IN IMAGINATION
2624-88360-0041 AND THE OTHER IS EFFECTIVE WITH NO TITLE AT ALL THE SCENARIO WRITER WHO WILL STUDY TO THE BOTTOM OF THE MATTER IN WHISTLER'S GENTLE ART OF MAKING ENEMIES WILL BE EQUIPPED TO WELCOME THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE OLD FASHIONED STAGE WHERE THE WORD RULES AND THE PHOTOPLAY
2624-88360-0042 WHERE SPLENDOR AND RITUAL ARE ALL IT IS NOT THE SAME DISTINCTION BUT A KINDRED ONE BUT LET US CONSIDER THE DETAILS OF THE MATTER THE STAGE HAS ITS EXITS AND ENTRANCES AT THE SIDE AND BACK THE STANDARD PHOTOPLAYS
2624-88360-0043 HAVE THEIR EXITS AND ENTRANCES ACROSS THE IMAGINARY FOOTLIGHT LINE EVEN IN THE MOST STIRRING MOB AND BATTLE SCENES IN JUDITH OF BETHULIA THOUGH THE PEOPLE SEEM TO BE COMING FROM EVERYWHERE AND GOING EVERYWHERE WHEN WE WATCH CLOSE WE SEE THAT THE INDIVIDUALS ENTER AT THE NEAR RIGHT HAND CORNER
2624-88360-0044 AND EXIT AT THE NEAR LEFT HAND CORNER OR ENTER AT THE NEAR LEFT HAND CORNER AND EXIT AT THE NEAR RIGHT HAND CORNER CONSIDER THE DEVICES WHEREBY THE STAGE ACTOR HOLDS THE AUDIENCE AS HE GOES OUT AT THE SIDE AND BACK HE SIGHS GESTURES HOWLS AND STRIDES
2624-88360-0045 THE PEOPLE LEFT IN THE SCENE ARE PYGMIES COMPARED WITH EACH DISAPPEARING CYCLOPS LIKEWISE WHEN THE ACTOR ENTERS AGAIN HIS MECHANICAL IMPORTANCE IS OVERWHELMING THEREFORE FOR HIS FIRST ENTRANCE THE MOTION PICTURE STAR DOES NOT REQUIRE THE PREPARATIONS THAT ARE MADE ON THE STAGE
2624-88360-0046 THAT HIS CAMERA BORN OPPORTUNITY TO MAGNIFY PERSONS AND THINGS INSTANTLY TO INTERWEAVE THEM AS ACTORS ON ONE LEVEL TO ALTERNATE SCENES AT THE SLIGHTEST WHIM
2624-88360-0047 BY ALTERNATING SCENES RAPIDLY FLASH AFTER FLASH COTTAGE FIELD MOUNTAIN TOP FIELD MOUNTAIN TOP COTTAGE WE HAVE A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THREE PLACES RATHER THAN THREE PERSONS BY ALTERNATING THE PICTURE OF A MAN
2624-88360-0048 AND THE CHECK HE IS FORGING WE HAVE HIS SOLILOQUY WHEN TWO PEOPLE TALK TO EACH OTHER IT IS BY LIFTING AND LOWERING OBJECTS RATHER THAN THEIR VOICES THE COLLECTOR PRESENTS A BILL THE ADVENTURER SHOWS HIM THE DOOR
2624-88360-0049 MOVING OBJECTS NOT MOVING LIPS MAKE THE WORDS OF THE PHOTOPLAY THE OLD FASHIONED STAGE PRODUCER FEELING HE IS GETTING NOWHERE BUT STILL HELPLESS PUTS THE CLIMAX OF SOME PUZZLING LIP DEBATE OFTEN THE CLIMAX OF THE WHOLE FILM AS A SENTENCE ON THE SCREEN
2624-88360-0050 SENTENCES SHOULD BE USED TO SHOW CHANGES OF TIME AND PLACE AND A FEW SUCH ELEMENTARY MATTERS BEFORE THE EPISODE IS FULLY STARTED THE CLIMAX OF A MOTION PICTURE SCENE CANNOT BE ONE WORD OR FIFTY WORDS
2624-88360-0051 AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN CONNECTION WITH CABIRIA THE CRISIS MUST BE AN ACTION SHARPER THAN ANY THAT HAS GONE BEFORE IN ORGANIC UNION WITH A TABLEAU MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANY THAT HAS PRECEDED THE BREAKING OF THE TENTH WAVE UPON THE SAND
2624-88360-0052 SUCH REMNANTS OF PANTOMIMIC DIALOGUE AS REMAIN IN THE MAIN CHASE OF THE PHOTOPLAY FILM ARE BUT GUIDE POSTS IN THE RACE TOWARD THE GOAL THEY SHOULD NOT BE ELABORATE TOLL GATES OF PLOT TO BE LABORIOUSLY LIFTED AND LOWERED WHILE THE HORSES STOP MID CAREER
2624-88360-0053 THE VENUS OF MILO THAT COMES DIRECTLY TO THE SOUL THROUGH THE SILENCE REQUIRES NO QUOTATION FROM KEATS TO EXPLAIN HER THOUGH KEATS IS THE EQUIVALENT IN VERSE HER SETTING IN THE GREAT FRENCH MUSEUM IS ENOUGH WE DO NOT KNOW THAT HER NAME IS VENUS
2624-88360-0054 SHE IS THOUGHT BY MANY TO BE ANOTHER STATUE OF VICTORY WE MAY SOME DAY EVOLVE SCENARIOS THAT WILL REQUIRE NOTHING MORE THAN A TITLE THROWN UPON THE SCREEN AT THE BEGINNING THEY COME TO THE EYE SO PERFECTLY THIS IS NOT THE ONLY POSSIBLE SORT
2624-88360-0055 BUT THE SELF IMPOSED LIMITATION IN CERTAIN FILMS MIGHT GIVE THEM A CHARM AKIN TO THAT OF THE SONGS WITHOUT WORDS
2624-88360-0056 IN THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST ACT THERE IS MUCH MOVING ABOUT AND EXTRA TALK ON THE PART OF THE ACTORS TO HOLD THE CROWD WHILE IT IS SETTLING DOWN
2624-88360-0057 IF HE APPEARS LATER HE IS GLARED AT IN THE MOTION PICTURE ART GALLERY ON THE OTHER HAND THE AUDIENCE IS AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND THESE ARE NOT A UNIT AND THE ONLY CRIME IS TO OBSTRUCT THE LINE OF VISION THE HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS CAN DO A MODERATE AMOUNT OF GIGGLING WITHOUT BREAKING THE SPELL
2624-88360-0058 THERE IS NO SPELL IN THE STAGE SENSE TO BREAK PEOPLE CAN CLIMB OVER EACH OTHER'S KNEES TO GET IN OR OUT IF THE PICTURE IS POLITICAL THEY MURMUR WAR CRIES TO ONE ANOTHER IF THE FILM SUGGESTS WHAT SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS HAVE BEEN DOING THEY CAN REGALE EACH OTHER WITH THE RICHEST SEWING SOCIETY REPORT
2624-88360-0059 THE PEOPLE IN THE MOTION PICTURE AUDIENCE TOTAL ABOUT TWO HUNDRED ANY TIME BUT THEY COME IN GROUPS OF TWO OR THREE AT NO SPECIFIED HOUR THE NEWCOMERS DO NOT AS IN VAUDEVILLE MAKE THEMSELVES PART OF A JOCULAR ARMY STRICTLY AS INDIVIDUALS THEY JUDGE THE PANORAMA
2624-88360-0060 IF THEY DISAPPROVE THERE IS GRUMBLING UNDER THEIR BREATH BUT NO HISSING I HAVE NEVER HEARD AN AUDIENCE IN A PHOTOPLAY THEATRE CLAP ITS HANDS EVEN WHEN THE HOUSE WAS BURSTING WITH PEOPLE YET THEY OFTEN SEE THE FILM THROUGH TWICE
2624-88360-0061 THEY MANIFEST THEIR FAVORABLE VERDICT BY SENDING SOME OTHER MEMBER OF THE FAMILY TO SEE THE PICTURE IF THE PEOPLE SO DELEGATED ARE LIKEWISE SATISFIED THEY MAY ASK THE MAN AT THE DOOR IF HE IS GOING TO BRING IT BACK THAT IS THE MOVING PICTURE KIND OF CHEERING
2624-88360-0062 IT WAS A THEATRICAL SIN WHEN THE OLD FASHIONED STAGE ACTOR WAS RENDERED UNIMPORTANT BY HIS SCENERY BUT THE MOTION PICTURE ACTOR IS BUT THE MOOD OF THE MOB OR THE LANDSCAPE OR THE DEPARTMENT STORE BEHIND HIM REDUCED TO A SINGLE HIEROGLYPHIC
2624-88360-0063 THE STAGE INTERIOR IS LARGE THE MOTION PICTURE INTERIOR IS SMALL THE STAGE OUT OF DOOR SCENE IS AT BEST ARTIFICIAL AND LITTLE AND IS GENERALLY AT REST OR ITS MOVEMENT IS TAINTED WITH ARTIFICIALITY THE WAVES DASH BUT NOT DASHINGLY
2624-88360-0064 THE WATER FLOWS BUT NOT FLOWINGLY THE MOTION PICTURE OUT OF DOOR SCENE IS AS BIG AS THE UNIVERSE AND ONLY PICTURES OF THE SAHARA ARE WITHOUT MAGNIFICENT MOTION
2624-88360-0065 THE PHOTOPLAY IS AS FAR FROM THE STAGE ON THE ONE HAND AS IT IS FROM THE NOVEL ON THE OTHER ITS NEAREST ANALOGY IN LITERATURE IS PERHAPS THE SHORT STORY OR THE LYRIC POEM THE KEY WORDS OF THE STAGE ARE PASSION AND CHARACTER OF THE PHOTOPLAY
2624-88360-0066 SPLENDOR AND SPEED THE STAGE IN ITS GREATEST POWER DEALS WITH PITY FOR SOME ONE ESPECIALLY UNFORTUNATE WITH WHOM WE GROW WELL ACQUAINTED WITH SOME PRIVATE REVENGE AGAINST SOME PARTICULAR DESPOILER
2624-88360-0067 TRACES THE BEGINNING AND CULMINATION OF JOY BASED ON THE GRATIFICATION OF SOME PREFERENCE OR LOVE FOR SOME PERSON WHOSE CHARM IS ALL HIS OWN THE DRAMA IS CONCERNED WITH THE SLOW INEVITABLE APPROACHES TO THESE INTENSITIES ON THE OTHER HAND THE MOTION PICTURE THOUGH OFTEN APPEARING TO DEAL WITH THESE THINGS
2624-88360-0068 AS A MATTER OF FACT USES SUBSTITUTES MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN LISTED BUT TO REVIEW ITS FIRST SUBSTITUTE IS THE EXCITEMENT OF SPEED MANIA STRETCHED ON THE FRAMEWORK OF AN OBVIOUS PLOT OR IT DEALS WITH DELICATE INFORMAL ANECDOTE AS THE SHORT STORY DOES OR FAIRY LEGERDEMAIN OR
2624-88360-0069 PATRIOTIC BANNERS OR GREAT SURGING MOBS OF THE PROLETARIAT OR BIG SCENIC OUTLOOKS OR MIRACULOUS BEINGS MADE VISIBLE
2624-88360-0070 THE MORE IT BECOMES LIKE A MURAL PAINTING FROM WHICH FLASHES OF LIGHTNING COME THE MORE IT REALIZES ITS GENIUS MEN LIKE GORDON CRAIG AND GRANVILLE BARKER ARE ALMOST WASTING THEIR GENIUS ON THE THEATRE THE SPLENDOR PHOTOPLAYS ARE THE GREAT OUTLET FOR THEIR TYPE OF IMAGINATION
2624-88360-0071 AND IT SHOULD LAST BUT THREE REELS THAT IS AN HOUR EDGAR POE SAID THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS A LONG POEM THERE IS CERTAINLY NO SUCH THING AS A LONG MOVING PICTURE MASTERPIECE THE STAGE PRODUCTION DEPENDS MOST LARGELY UPON THE POWER OF THE ACTORS
2624-88360-0072 THE MOVIE SHOW UPON THE GENIUS OF THE PRODUCER THE PERFORMERS AND THE DUMB OBJECTS ARE ON EQUAL TERMS IN HIS PAINT BUCKETS THE STAR SYSTEM IS BAD FOR THE STAGE BECAUSE THE MINOR PARTS ARE SMOTHERED AND THE SITUATIONS DISTORTED TO GIVE THE FAVORITE AN ORBIT
2624-88360-0073 IT IS BAD FOR THE MOTION PICTURES BECAUSE IT OBSCURES THE PRODUCER WHILE THE LEADING ACTOR IS ENTITLED TO HIS GLORY AS ARE ALL THE ACTORS THEIR MANNERISMS SHOULD NOT OVERSHADOW THE LATEST INSPIRATIONS OF THE CREATOR OF THE FILMS
2624-88360-0074 THE DISPLAY OF THE NAME OF THE CORPORATION IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR GIVING THE GLORY TO THE PRODUCER AN ARTISTIC PHOTOPLAY IS NOT THE RESULT OF A MILITARY EFFICIENCY SYSTEM IT IS NOT A FACTORY MADE STAPLE ARTICLE BUT THE PRODUCT OF THE CREATIVE FORCE OF ONE SOUL
2624-88360-0075 THE FLOWERING OF A SPIRIT THAT HAS THE HABIT OF PERPETUALLY RENEWING ITSELF ONCE I SAW MARY FULLER IN A CLASSIC IT WAS THE LIFE AND DEATH OF MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS
2624-88360-0076 NOT ONLY WAS THE TENSE FIDGETY OVER AMERICAN MARY FULLER TRANSFORMED INTO A BEING WHO WAS A POPPY AND A TIGER LILY AND A SNOW QUEEN AND A ROSE BUT SHE AND HER COMPANY INCLUDING MARC MACDERMOTT RADIATED THE OLD SCOTCH PATRIOTISM THEY MADE THE PICTURE A MEMORIAL
2624-88360-0077 IT REMINDED ONE OF MAURICE HEWLETT'S NOVEL THE QUEEN'S QUAIR EVIDENTLY ALL THE ACTORS WERE FUSED BY SOME NOBLE MANAGERIAL MOOD
2624-88360-0078 AND THIS RULE MAY APPLY TO THE STAGE BUT BY COMPARISON TO MOTION PICTURE PERFORMERS STAGE ACTORS ARE THEIR OWN MANAGERS FOR THEY HAVE AN APPROXIMATE NOTION OF HOW THEY LOOK IN THE EYE OF THE AUDIENCE WHICH IS BUT THE HUMAN EYE THEY CAN HEAR AND GAUGE THEIR OWN VOICES THEY HAVE THE SAME EARS AS THEIR LISTENERS
2624-88360-0079 AS THE AUDIENCE WILL DO LATER THE ACTORS HAVE NOT THE LEAST NOTION OF THEIR APPEARANCE ALSO THE WORDS IN THE MOTION PICTURE ARE NOT THINGS WHOSE FORCE THE ACTOR CAN GAUGE THE BOOK UNDER THE TABLE IS ONE WORD THE DOG BEHIND THE CHAIR IS ANOTHER
2624-88360-0080 THE WINDOW CURTAIN FLYING IN THE BREEZE IS ANOTHER THIS CHAPTER HAS IMPLIED THAT THE PERFORMERS WERE BUT PAINT ON THE CANVAS THEY ARE BOTH PAINT AND MODELS
2624-88360-0081 THEY ARE MODELS IN THE SENSE THAT THE YOUNG ELLEN TERRY WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR WATTS SIR GALAHAD THEY RESEMBLE THE PERSONS IN PRIVATE LIFE WHO FURNISH THE BASIS FOR NOVELS DICKENS MOTHER WAS THE ORIGINAL OF MISSUS NICKLEBY HIS FATHER ENTERED INTO WILKINS MICAWBER
2624-88360-0082 BUT THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT PERPETUALLY THRUST UPON US AS MISTER AND MISSUS DICKENS WE ARE GLAD TO FIND THEM IN THE DICKENS BIOGRAPHIES WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN IT IS MICAWBER AND MISSUS NICKLEBY WE WANT AND THE CHARLES DICKENS ATMOSPHERE
2624-88360-0083 THE PHOTOPLAYS OF THE FUTURE WILL BE WRITTEN FROM THE FOUNDATIONS FOR THE FILMS THE SOUNDEST ACTORS PHOTOGRAPHERS AND PRODUCERS WILL BE THOSE WHO EMPHASIZE THE POINTS WHEREIN THE PHOTOPLAY IS UNIQUE WHAT IS ADAPTED TO COMPLETE EXPRESSION IN ONE ART
2624-88360-0084 GENERALLY SECURES BUT HALF EXPRESSION IN ANOTHER THE SUPREME PHOTOPLAY WILL GIVE US THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN BUT HALF EXPRESSED IN ALL OTHER MEDIUMS ALLIED TO IT ONCE THIS PRINCIPLE IS GRASPED THERE IS EVERY REASON WHY THE SAME PEOPLE WHO HAVE INTERESTED THEMSELVES IN THE ADVANCED EXPERIMENTAL DRAMA
2624-88360-0085 SHOULD TAKE HOLD OF THE SUPER PHOTOPLAY THE GOOD CITIZENS WHO CAN MOST EASILY GRASP THE DISTINCTION SHOULD BE THERE TO PERPETUATE THE HIGHER WELFARE OF THESE INSTITUTIONS SIDE BY SIDE THIS PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT SHOULD COME IF FOR NO OTHER REASON BECAUSE
2624-88360-0086 THE TWO ARTS ARE STILL ROUGHLY CLASSED TOGETHER BY THE PUBLIC THE ELECT CANNOT TEACH THE PUBLIC WHAT THE DRAMA IS TILL THEY SHOW THEM PRECISELY WHAT THE PHOTOPLAY IS AND IS NOT JUST AS THE UNIVERSITY HAS DEPARTMENTS OF BOTH HISTORY AND ENGLISH TEACHING IN AMITY
2624-88360-0087 EACH ONE ILLUMINATING THE WORK OF THE OTHER SO THESE TWO FORMS SHOULD LIVE IN EACH OTHER'S SIGHT IN FINE AND FRIENDLY CONTRAST AT PRESENT
