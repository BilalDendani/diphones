7348-294687-0000 THE NARRATIVE GEORGE GERMAINE WRITES AND TELLS HIS OWN LOVE STORY CHAPTER ONE GREENWATER BROAD LOOK BACK MY MEMORY
7348-294687-0001 THROUGH THE DIM LABYRINTH OF THE PAST THROUGH THE MINGLING JOYS AND SORROWS OF TWENTY YEARS RISE AGAIN MY BOYHOOD'S DAYS BY THE WINDING GREEN SHORES OF THE LITTLE LAKE
7348-294687-0002 COME TO ME ONCE MORE MY CHILD LOVE IN THE INNOCENT BEAUTY OF YOUR FIRST TEN YEARS OF LIFE LET US LIVE AGAIN MY ANGEL AS WE LIVED IN OUR FIRST PARADISE BEFORE SIN AND SORROW
7348-294687-0003 LIFTED THEIR FLAMING SWORDS AND DROVE US OUT INTO THE WORLD THE MONTH WAS MARCH THE LAST WILD FOWL OF THE SEASON WERE FLOATING ON THE WATERS OF THE LAKE
7348-294687-0004 WHICH IN OUR SUFFOLK TONGUE WE CALLED GREENWATER BROAD WIND WHERE IT MIGHT THE GRASSY BANKS AND THE OVERHANGING TREES TINGED THE LAKE WITH THE SOFT GREEN REFLECTIONS FROM WHICH IT TOOK ITS NAME
7348-294687-0005 IN A CREEK AT THE SOUTH END THE BOATS WERE KEPT MY OWN PRETTY SAILING BOAT HAVING A TINY NATURAL HARBOR ALL TO ITSELF IN A CREEK AT THE NORTH END
7348-294687-0006 USED FOR SNARING THE WILD FOWL WHICH FLOCKED EVERY WINTER BY THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS TO GREENWATER BROAD MY LITTLE MARY AND I WENT OUT TOGETHER HAND IN HAND TO SEE THE LAST BIRDS OF THE SEASON
7348-294687-0007 THE OUTER PART OF THE STRANGE BIRD TRAP ROSE FROM THE WATERS OF THE LAKE IN A SERIES OF CIRCULAR ARCHES FORMED OF ELASTIC BRANCHES BENT TO THE NEEDED SHAPE AND COVERED WITH FOLDS OF FINE NETWORK MAKING THE ROOF
7348-294687-0008 LITTLE BY LITTLE DIMINISHING IN SIZE THE ARCHES AND THEIR NET WORK FOLLOWED THE SECRET WINDINGS OF THE CREEK INLAND TO ITS END BUILT BACK ROUND THE ARCHES ON THEIR LANDWARD SIDE
7348-294687-0009 RAN A WOODEN PALING HIGH ENOUGH TO HIDE A MAN KNEELING BEHIND IT FROM THE VIEW OF THE BIRDS ON THE LAKE AT CERTAIN INTERVALS A HOLE WAS BROKEN IN THE PALING
7348-294687-0010 JUST LARGE ENOUGH TO ALLOW OF THE PASSAGE THROUGH IT OF A DOG OF THE TERRIER OR THE SPANIEL BREED AND THERE BEGAN AND ENDED THE SIMPLE
7348-294687-0011 IN THOSE DAYS I WAS THIRTEEN AND MARY WAS TEN YEARS OLD WALKING ON OUR WAY TO THE LAKE WE HAD MARY'S FATHER WITH US FOR GUIDE AND COMPANION
7348-294687-0012 THE GOOD MAN SERVED AS BAILIFF ON MY FATHER'S ESTATE HE WAS BESIDES A SKILLED MASTER IN THE ART OF DECOYING DUCKS THE DOG THAT HELPED HIM
7348-294687-0013 WE USED NO TAME DUCKS AS DECOYS IN SUFFOLK WAS A LITTLE BLACK TERRIER A SKILLED MASTER ALSO IN HIS WAY A CREATURE WHO POSSESSED IN EQUAL PROPORTIONS
7348-294687-0014 THE ENVIABLE ADVANTAGES OF PERFECT GOOD HUMOR AND PERFECT COMMON SENSE THE DOG FOLLOWED THE BAILIFF AND WE FOLLOWED THE DOG
7348-294687-0015 THE DOG SAT DOWN TO WAIT UNTIL HE WAS WANTED THE BAILIFF AND THE CHILDREN CROUCHED BEHIND THE PALING AND PEEPED THROUGH THE OUTERMOST DOG HOLE WHICH COMMANDED A FULL VIEW OF THE LAKE IT WAS A DAY WITHOUT WIND
7348-294687-0016 NOT A RIPPLE STIRRED THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
7348-294687-0017 AND HID THE SUN FROM VIEW WE PEEPED THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE PALING THERE WERE THE WILD DUCKS
7348-294687-0018 PLACIDLY DRESSING THEIR FEATHERS ON THE PLACID SURFACE OF THE LAKE THE BAILIFF LOOKED AT THE DOG AND MADE A SIGN THE DOG LOOKED AT THE BAILIFF AND STEPPING FORWARD QUIETLY PASSED THROUGH THE HOLE
7348-294687-0019 SO AS TO SHOW HIMSELF ON THE NARROW STRIP OF GROUND SHELVING DOWN FROM THE OUTER SIDE OF THE PALING TO THE LAKE FIRST ONE DUCK THEN ANOTHER THEN HALF A DOZEN TOGETHER DISCOVERED THE DOG
7348-294687-0020 A NEW OBJECT SHOWING ITSELF ON THE SOLITARY SCENE INSTANTLY BECAME AN OBJECT OF ALL DEVOURING CURIOSITY TO THE DUCKS THE OUTERMOST OF THEM BEGAN TO SWIM SLOWLY TOWARD THE STRANGE FOUR FOOTED CREATURE
7348-294687-0021 PLANTED MOTIONLESS ON THE BANK BY TWOS AND THREES THE MAIN BODY OF THE WATERFOWL GRADUALLY FOLLOWED THE ADVANCED GUARD SWIMMING NEARER AND NEARER TO THE DOG THE WARY DUCKS SUDDENLY CAME TO A HALT AND
7348-294687-0022 POISED ON THE WATER VIEWED FROM A SAFE DISTANCE THE PHENOMENON ON THE LAND THE BAILIFF KNEELING BEHIND THE PALING WHISPERED TRIM HEARING HIS NAME THE TERRIER TURNED ABOUT
7348-294687-0023 AND RETIRING THROUGH THE HOLE BECAME LOST TO THE VIEW OF THE DUCKS MOTIONLESS ON THE WATER THE WILD FOWL WONDERED AND WAITED IN A MINUTE MORE THE DOG HAD TROTTED ROUND
7348-294687-0024 AND HAD SHOWN HIMSELF THROUGH THE NEXT HOLE IN THE PALING PIERCED FURTHER INWARD WHERE THE LAKE RAN UP INTO THE OUTERMOST OF THE WINDINGS OF THE CREEK THE SECOND APPEARANCE OF THE TERRIER
7348-294687-0025 INSTANTLY PRODUCED A SECOND FIT OF CURIOSITY AMONG THE DUCKS WITH ONE ACCORD THEY SWAM FORWARD AGAIN TO GET ANOTHER AND A NEARER VIEW OF THE DOG THEN JUDGING THEIR SAFE DISTANCE ONCE MORE THEY STOPPED FOR THE SECOND TIME
7348-294687-0026 UNDER THE OUTERMOST ARCH OF THE DECOY AGAIN THE DOG VANISHED AND THE PUZZLED DUCKS WAITED AN INTERVAL PASSED AND THE THIRD APPEARANCE OF TRIM TOOK PLACE THROUGH A THIRD HOLE IN THE PALING
7348-294687-0027 PIERCED FURTHER INLAND UP THE CREEK FOR THE THIRD TIME IRRESISTIBLE CURIOSITY URGED THE DUCKS TO ADVANCE FURTHER AND FURTHER INWARD
7348-294687-0028 A FOURTH AND A FIFTH TIME THE GAME WENT ON UNTIL THE DOG HAD LURED THE WATER FOWL FROM POINT TO POINT INTO THE INNER RECESSES OF THE DECOY THERE
7348-294687-0029 A LAST APPEARANCE OF TRIM TOOK PLACE A LAST ADVANCE A LAST CAUTIOUS PAUSE WAS MADE BY THE DUCKS THE BAILIFF TOUCHED THE STRINGS THE WEIGHED NET WORK FELL VERTICALLY INTO THE WATER
7348-294687-0030 CAUGHT BY MEANS OF THEIR OWN CURIOSITY WITH NOTHING BUT A LITTLE DOG FOR A BAIT IN A FEW HOURS AFTERWARD THEY WERE ALL DEAD DUCKS ON THEIR WAY TO THE LONDON MARKET
7348-294687-0031 LITTLE MARY LAID HER HAND ON MY SHOULDER AND RAISING HERSELF ON TIPTOE WHISPERED IN MY EAR GEORGE COME HOME WITH ME I HAVE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU THAT IS BETTER WORTH SEEING THAN THE DUCKS WHAT IS IT
7348-294687-0032 IT'S A SURPRISE I WON'T TELL YOU WILL YOU GIVE ME A KISS THE CHARMING LITTLE CREATURE PUT HER SLIM SUN BURNED ARMS ROUND MY NECK AND ANSWERED AS MANY KISSES AS YOU LIKE GEORGE
7348-294687-0033 IT WAS INNOCENTLY SAID ON HER SIDE IT WAS INNOCENTLY DONE ON MINE THE GOOD EASY BAILIFF LOOKING ASIDE AT THE MOMENT FROM HIS DUCKS DISCOVERED US PURSUING OUR BOY AND GIRL COURTSHIP
7348-294687-0034 IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS HE SHOOK HIS BIG FOREFINGER AT US WITH SOMETHING OF A SAD AND DOUBTING SMILE AH MASTER GEORGE MASTER GEORGE
7348-294687-0035 HE SAID WHEN YOUR FATHER COMES HOME DO YOU THINK HE WILL APPROVE OF HIS SON AND HEIR KISSING HIS BAILIFF'S DAUGHTER WHEN MY FATHER COMES HOME I ANSWERED WITH GREAT DIGNITY
7348-294687-0036 I SHALL TELL HIM THE TRUTH I SHALL SAY I AM GOING TO MARRY YOUR DAUGHTER THE BAILIFF BURST OUT LAUGHING AND LOOKED BACK AGAIN AT HIS DUCKS WELL WELL
7348-294687-0037 WE HEARD HIM SAY TO HIMSELF THEY'RE ONLY CHILDREN THERE'S NO CALL POOR THINGS TO PART THEM YET AWHILE MARY AND I HAD A GREAT DISLIKE TO BE CALLED CHILDREN
7348-294687-0038 PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD ONE OF US WAS A LADY AGED TEN AND THE OTHER WAS A GENTLEMAN AGED THIRTEEN
