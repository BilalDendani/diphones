3009-10327-0000 QUESTION FIFTY
3009-10327-0001 FIRSTLY THE PURELY SPIRITUAL CREATURE WHICH IN HOLY SCRIPTURE IS CALLED ANGEL SECONDLY THE CREATURE WHOLLY CORPOREAL THIRDLY THE COMPOSITE CREATURE CORPOREAL AND SPIRITUAL WHICH IS MAN
3009-10327-0002 CONCERNING THE ANGELS WE CONSIDER FIRST WHAT BELONGS TO THEIR SUBSTANCE SECONDLY WHAT BELONGS TO THEIR INTELLECT THIRDLY WHAT BELONGS TO THEIR WILL FOURTHLY WHAT BELONGS TO THEIR CREATION
3009-10327-0003 THEIR SUBSTANCE WE CONSIDER ABSOLUTELY AND IN RELATION TO CORPOREAL THINGS CONCERNING THEIR SUBSTANCE ABSOLUTELY CONSIDERED
3009-10327-0004 IT WOULD SEEM THAT AN ANGEL IS NOT ENTIRELY INCORPOREAL FOR WHAT IS INCORPOREAL ONLY AS REGARDS OURSELVES AND NOT
3009-10327-0005 THEREFORE EVERY CREATURE IS CORPOREAL NOW ANGELS ARE GOD'S CREATURES AS APPEARS
3009-10327-0006 HE COMMANDED AND THEY WERE CREATED THEREFORE ANGELS ARE CORPOREAL
3009-10327-0007 I ANSWER THAT THERE MUST BE SOME INCORPOREAL CREATURES FOR WHAT IS PRINCIPALLY INTENDED BY GOD IN CREATURES IS GOOD AND THIS CONSISTS IN ASSIMILATION TO GOD HIMSELF
3009-10327-0008 AND THE PERFECT ASSIMILATION OF AN EFFECT TO A CAUSE IS ACCOMPLISHED WHEN THE EFFECT IMITATES THE CAUSE ACCORDING TO THAT WHEREBY THE CAUSE
3009-10327-0009 CANNOT BE THE ACTION OF A BODY NOR OF ANY CORPOREAL FACULTY FOR EVERY BODY IS LIMITED TO HERE AND NOW HENCE THE PERFECTION OF THE UNIVERSE REQUIRES THE EXISTENCE OF AN INCORPOREAL CREATURE
3009-10327-0010 THE ANCIENTS HOWEVER NOT PROPERLY REALIZING THE FORCE OF INTELLIGENCE AND FAILING TO MAKE A PROPER DISTINCTION BETWEEN SENSE AND INTELLECT THOUGHT THAT NOTHING EXISTED IN THE WORLD BUT WHAT COULD BE APPREHENDED BY SENSE
3009-10327-0011 SEEMS TO BE COLD AND THUS IT IS SAID THAT ANGELS COMPARED TO GOD ARE MATERIAL AND CORPOREAL NOT HOWEVER AS IF ANYTHING CORPOREAL EXISTED IN THEM
3009-10327-0012 MOVEMENT IS THERE TAKEN IN THE SENSE IN WHICH IT IS APPLIED TO INTELLIGENCE AND WILL THEREFORE AN ANGEL IS CALLED AN EVER MOBILE SUBSTANCE BECAUSE HE IS EVER ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT
3009-10327-0013 AND NOT AS IF HE WERE SOMETIMES ACTUALLY AND SOMETIMES POTENTIALLY AS WE ARE HENCE IT IS CLEAR THAT THE OBJECTION RESTS ON AN EQUIVOCATION
3009-10327-0014 TO BE CIRCUMSCRIBED BY LOCAL LIMITS BELONGS TO BODIES ONLY WHEREAS TO BE CIRCUMSCRIBED BY ESSENTIAL LIMITS BELONGS TO ALL CREATURES
3009-10327-0015 FOR EVERYTHING WHICH IS CONTAINED UNDER ANY GENUS IS COMPOSED OF THE GENUS AND OF THE DIFFERENCE WHICH
3009-10327-0016 AND THE ABOVE PROPERTIES ARE FOUND IN THE ANGEL THEREFORE AN ANGEL IS COMPOSED OF MATTER AND FORM
3009-10327-0017 FORM IS ACT SO WHAT IS FORM ONLY IS PURE ACT BUT AN ANGEL IS NOT PURE ACT FOR THIS BELONGS TO GOD ALONE THEREFORE AN ANGEL IS NOT FORM ONLY
3009-10327-0018 BUT HAS A FORM IN MATTER
3009-10327-0019 FORM IS PROPERLY LIMITED AND PERFECTED BY MATTER SO THE FORM WHICH IS NOT IN MATTER IS AN INFINITE FORM BUT THE FORM OF AN ANGEL IS NOT INFINITE FOR EVERY CREATURE IS FINITE
3009-10327-0020 THEREFORE THE FORM OF AN ANGEL IS IN MATTER
3009-10327-0021 TO BE AS IMMATERIAL AS THEY ARE INCORPOREAL I ANSWER THAT SOME ASSERT THAT THE ANGELS ARE COMPOSED OF MATTER AND FORM
3009-10327-0022 IN HIS BOOK OF THE FOUNT OF LIFE FOR HE SUPPOSES THAT WHATEVER THINGS ARE DISTINGUISHED BY THE INTELLECT ARE REALLY DISTINCT NOW AS REGARDS INCORPOREAL SUBSTANCE
3009-10327-0023 THE INTELLECT APPREHENDS THAT WHICH DISTINGUISHES IT FROM CORPOREAL SUBSTANCE AND THAT WHICH IT HAS IN COMMON WITH IT HENCE HE CONCLUDES THAT WHAT DISTINGUISHES INCORPOREAL FROM CORPOREAL SUBSTANCE IS A KIND OF FORM TO IT
3009-10327-0024 AND WHATEVER IS SUBJECT TO THIS DISTINGUISHING FORM AS IT WERE SOMETHING COMMON IS ITS MATTER THEREFORE HE ASSERTS THE UNIVERSAL MATTER OF SPIRITUAL AND CORPOREAL THINGS IS THE SAME SO THAT IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT
3009-10327-0025 THE FORM OF INCORPOREAL SUBSTANCE IS IMPRESSED IN THE MATTER OF SPIRITUAL THINGS IN THE SAME WAY AS THE FORM OF QUANTITY IS IMPRESSED IN THE MATTER OF CORPOREAL THINGS BUT ONE GLANCE IS ENOUGH TO SHOW
3009-10327-0026 THAT THERE CANNOT BE ONE MATTER OF SPIRITUAL AND OF CORPOREAL THINGS FOR IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT A SPIRITUAL AND A CORPOREAL FORM SHOULD BE RECEIVED INTO THE SAME PART OF MATTER OTHERWISE ONE AND THE SAME THING
3009-10327-0027 WOULD BE CORPOREAL AND SPIRITUAL HENCE IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT ONE PART OF MATTER RECEIVES THE CORPOREAL FORM AND ANOTHER RECEIVES THE SPIRITUAL FORM MATTER HOWEVER IS NOT DIVISIBLE INTO PARTS
3009-10327-0028 IMPOSSIBLE FOR AN INTELLECTUAL SUBSTANCE TO HAVE ANY KIND OF MATTER FOR THE OPERATION BELONGING TO ANYTHING IS ACCORDING TO THE MODE OF ITS SUBSTANCE NOW TO UNDERSTAND IS AN ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL
3009-10327-0029 OPERATION AS APPEARS FROM ITS OBJECT WHENCE ANY ACT RECEIVES ITS SPECIES AND NATURE FOR A THING IS UNDERSTOOD ACCORDING TO ITS DEGREE OF IMMATERIALITY BECAUSE FORMS THAT EXIST IN MATTER
3009-10327-0030 ARE INDIVIDUAL FORMS WHICH THE INTELLECT CANNOT APPREHEND AS SUCH HENCE IT MUST BE THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL SUBSTANCE IS ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL
3009-10327-0031 BUT THINGS DISTINGUISHED BY THE INTELLECT ARE NOT NECESSARILY DISTINGUISHED IN REALITY BECAUSE THE INTELLECT DOES NOT APPREHEND THINGS ACCORDING TO THEIR MODE BUT ACCORDING TO ITS OWN MODE HENCE
3009-10327-0032 MATERIAL THINGS WHICH ARE BELOW OUR INTELLECT EXIST IN OUR INTELLECT IN A SIMPLER MODE THAN THEY EXIST IN THEMSELVES ANGELIC SUBSTANCES
3009-10327-0033 AND FROM THE FORMER THE DIFFERENCE WHEREAS IN IMMATERIAL THINGS THERE IS NO SEPARATE DETERMINATOR AND THING DETERMINED EACH THING BY ITS OWN SELF HOLDS A DETERMINATE GRADE IN BEING
3009-10327-0034 AND THEREFORE IN THEM GENUS AND DIFFERENCE ARE NOT DERIVED FROM DIFFERENT THINGS BUT FROM ONE AND THE SAME NEVERTHELESS THIS DIFFERS IN OUR MODE OF CONCEPTION FOR INASMUCH AS OUR INTELLECT CONSIDERS IT
3009-10327-0035 AS INDETERMINATE IT DERIVES THE IDEA OF THEIR GENUS AND INASMUCH AS IT CONSIDERS IT DETERMINATELY IT DERIVES THE IDEA OF THEIR DIFFERENCE REPLY
3009-10327-0036 THIS REASON IS GIVEN IN THE BOOK ON THE FOUNT OF LIFE AND IT WOULD BE COGENT SUPPOSING THAT THE RECEPTIVE MODE OF THE INTELLECT AND OF MATTER WERE THE SAME BUT THIS IS CLEARLY FALSE
3009-10327-0037 FOR MATTER RECEIVES THE FORM THAT THEREBY IT MAY BE CONSTITUTED IN SOME SPECIES EITHER OF AIR OR OF FIRE OR OF SOMETHING ELSE
3009-10327-0038 HENCE SUCH A WAY OF RECEIVING IS NOT THAT OF MATTER BUT OF AN IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCE
3009-10327-0039 ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO COMPOSITION OF MATTER AND FORM IN AN ANGEL YET THERE IS ACT AND POTENTIALITY AND THIS CAN BE MADE EVIDENT IF WE CONSIDER THE NATURE OF MATERIAL THINGS
3009-10327-0040 WHICH CONTAIN A TWOFOLD COMPOSITION THE FIRST IS THAT OF FORM AND MATTER WHEREBY THE NATURE IS CONSTITUTED SUCH A COMPOSITE NATURE IS NOT ITS OWN EXISTENCE BUT EXISTENCE IS ITS ACT
3009-10327-0041 HENCE THE NATURE ITSELF IS RELATED TO ITS OWN EXISTENCE AS POTENTIALITY TO ACT THEREFORE IF THERE BE NO MATTER AND SUPPOSING THAT THE FORM ITSELF SUBSISTS WITHOUT MATTER
3009-10327-0042 THERE NEVERTHELESS STILL REMAINS THE RELATION OF THE FORM TO ITS VERY EXISTENCE AS OF POTENTIALITY TO ACT AND SUCH A KIND OF COMPOSITION IS UNDERSTOOD TO BE IN THE ANGELS AND THIS IS WHAT SOME SAY
3009-10327-0043 THAT AN ANGEL IS COMPOSED OF WHEREBY HE IS AND WHAT IS OR EXISTENCE AND WHAT IS
3009-10327-0044 FOR WHAT IS IS THE FORM ITSELF SUBSISTING
3009-10327-0045 IS NOT ABSOLUTELY SUBSISTING BUT IS LIMITED TO SOME NATURE TO WHICH IT BELONGS BUT THERE IS NOTHING AGAINST A CREATURE BEING CONSIDERED RELATIVELY INFINITE MATERIAL CREATURES ARE INFINITE ON THE PART OF MATTER
3009-10327-0046 ARE NOT RECEIVED IN ANYTHING ELSE AS IF WE WERE TO SAY FOR EXAMPLE THAT WHITENESS EXISTING SEPARATE IS INFINITE AS REGARDS THE NATURE OF WHITENESS FORASMUCH
3009-10327-0047 THE MORE A THING APPROACHES TO UNITY SO MUCH THE LESS IS IT MULTIPLIED AS IS EVIDENT IN NUMBERS BUT AMONG OTHER CREATED NATURES THE ANGELIC NATURE APPROACHES NEAREST TO GOD THEREFORE SINCE GOD IS SUPREMELY ONE
3009-10327-0048 IT SEEMS THAT THERE IS THE LEAST POSSIBLE NUMBER IN THE ANGELIC NATURE
3009-10327-0049 IN GREATER NUMBER THAN THE MOVEMENTS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES
3009-10327-0050 SUBSIST BECAUSE OF THE RAYS OF THE DIVINE GOODNESS BUT A RAY IS ONLY MULTIPLIED ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT RECEIVE IT NOW IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THEIR MATTER IS RECEPTIVE OF AN INTELLIGIBLE RAY
3009-10327-0051 SINCE INTELLECTUAL SUBSTANCES
3009-10327-0052 THAT THE MULTIPLICATION OF INTELLECTUAL SUBSTANCES CAN ONLY BE ACCORDING TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FIRST BODIES THAT IS OF THE HEAVENLY ONES SO THAT IN SOME WAY THE SHEDDING FORM OF THE AFORESAID RAYS
3009-10327-0053 MAY BE TERMINATED IN THEM AND HENCE THE SAME CONCLUSION IS TO BE DRAWN AS BEFORE ON THE CONTRARY
3009-10327-0054 MINISTERED TO HIM AND TEN THOUSANDS TIMES A HUNDRED THOUSAND STOOD BEFORE HIM I ANSWER THAT THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS OPINIONS WITH REGARD TO THE NUMBER
3009-10327-0055 OF THE SEPARATE SUBSTANCES PLATO CONTENDED THAT THE SEPARATE SUBSTANCES ARE THE SPECIES OF SENSIBLE THINGS AS IF WE WERE TO MAINTAIN THAT HUMAN NATURE IS A SEPARATE SUBSTANCE OF ITSELF AND ACCORDING TO THIS VIEW
3009-10327-0056 IT WOULD HAVE TO BE MAINTAINED THAT THE NUMBER OF THE SEPARATE SUBSTANCES IS THE NUMBER
3009-10327-0057 TO THE CUSTOM OF THE SCRIPTURES FOR THE POWERS OF IRRATIONAL THINGS TO BE DESIGNATED AS ANGELS HENCE IT MUST BE SAID THAT THE ANGELS EVEN INASMUCH AS THEY ARE IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCES
3009-10327-0058 EXIST IN EXCEEDING GREAT NUMBER FAR BEYOND ALL MATERIAL MULTITUDE THIS
3009-10327-0059 THE MORE PERFECT SOME THINGS ARE IN SO MUCH GREATER AN EXCESS ARE THEY CREATED BY GOD NOW AS IN BODIES SUCH EXCESS IS OBSERVED IN REGARD TO THEIR MAGNITUDE SO IN THINGS INCORPOREAL
3009-10327-0060 IN REGARD TO THEIR MULTITUDE WE SEE IN FACT THAT INCORRUPTIBLE BODIES EXCEED CORRUPTIBLE BODIES ALMOST INCOMPARABLY IN MAGNITUDE FOR THE ENTIRE SPHERE OF THINGS ACTIVE AND PASSIVE
3009-10327-0061 IS SOMETHING VERY SMALL IN COMPARISON WITH THE HEAVENLY BODIES HENCE IT IS REASONABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT THE IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCES AS IT WERE INCOMPARABLY EXCEED MATERIAL SUBSTANCES AS TO MULTITUDE
3009-10327-0062 IN THE ANGELS NUMBER IS NOT THAT OF DISCRETE QUANTITY BROUGHT ABOUT BY DIVISION OF WHAT IS CONTINUOUS
3009-10327-0063 HE WAS FORCED TO MAKE USE OF THIS ARGUMENT SINCE ONLY THROUGH SENSIBLE THINGS CAN WE COME TO KNOW
3009-10327-0064 NAMELY AS ONE IS SIMPLER THAN ANOTHER AND OF KEENER INTELLECT THEREFORE THE ANGELS DO NOT DIFFER SPECIFICALLY
3009-10327-0065 THE MORE OUGHT IT TO BE MULTIPLIED BUT THIS WOULD NOT BE SO IF THERE WERE BUT ONE INDIVIDUAL UNDER ONE SPECIES
3009-10327-0066 THAT SOME HAVE SAID THAT ALL SPIRITUAL SUBSTANCES EVEN SOULS ARE OF THE ONE SPECIES OTHERS AGAIN THAT ALL THE ANGELS ARE OF THE ONE SPECIES BUT NOT SOULS WHILE OTHERS ALLEGE
3009-10327-0067 THAT ALL THE ANGELS OF ONE HIERARCHY OR EVEN OF ONE ORDER ARE OF THE ONE SPECIES BUT THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR SUCH THINGS AS AGREE IN SPECIES BUT DIFFER IN NUMBER AGREE IN FORM
3009-10327-0068 BUT ARE DISTINGUISHED MATERIALLY IF THEREFORE THE ANGELS
3009-10327-0069 FOR TWO ANGELS TO BE OF ONE SPECIES JUST AS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THERE TO BE SEVERAL WHITENESSES APART OR SEVERAL HUMANITIES SINCE WHITENESSES ARE NOT SEVERAL EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE IN SEVERAL SUBSTANCES
3009-10327-0070 AND IF THE ANGELS HAD MATTER NOT EVEN THEN COULD THERE BE SEVERAL ANGELS OF ONE SPECIES FOR IT WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR MATTER TO BE THE PRINCIPLE OF DISTINCTION OF ONE FROM THE OTHER NOT INDEED ACCORDING TO THE DIVISION
3009-10327-0071 OF QUANTITY SINCE THEY ARE INCORPOREAL BUT ACCORDING TO THE DIVERSITY OF THEIR POWERS AND SUCH DIVERSITY OF MATTER CAUSES DIVERSITY NOT MERELY OF SPECIES BUT OF GENUS
3009-10327-0072 THAN THE UNDETERMINED AND THE PROPER THAN THE COMMON BUT NOT AS ONE NATURE IS NOBLER THAN ANOTHER OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE NECESSARY THAT ALL IRRATIONAL ANIMALS BE OF THE SAME SPECIES OR THAT THERE SHOULD BE IN THEM SOME FORM
3009-10327-0073 WHICH IS HIGHER THAN THE SENSIBLE SOUL THEREFORE IRRATIONAL ANIMALS DIFFER IN SPECIES ACCORDING TO THE VARIOUS DETERMINED DEGREES OF SENSITIVE NATURE AND IN LIKE MANNER ALL THE ANGELS DIFFER IN SPECIES ACCORDING
3009-10327-0074 TO THE DIVERSE DEGREES OF INTELLECTUAL NATURE
3009-10327-0075 MORE AND LESS CHANGE THE SPECIES NOT ACCORDING AS THEY ARE CAUSED BY THE INTENSITY OR REMISSNESS OF ONE FORM BUT ACCORDING AS THEY ARE CAUSED BY FORMS OF DIVERSE DEGREES FOR INSTANCE IF WE SAY THAT FIRE
3009-10327-0076 IS MORE PERFECT THAN AIR AND IN THIS WAY THE ANGELS ARE DIVERSIFIED ACCORDING TO MORE OR LESS REPLY
3009-10327-0077 THE GOOD OF THE SPECIES PREPONDERATES OVER THE GOOD OF THE INDIVIDUAL HENCE IT IS MUCH BETTER FOR THE SPECIES TO BE MULTIPLIED IN THE ANGELS THAN FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE MULTIPLIED
3009-10327-0078 TO BE THE ANGELS THEREFORE THE ANGELS ARE CORRUPTIBLE BY THEIR NATURE
3009-10327-0079 UNLESS THE HAND OF THE ALMIGHTY PRESERVED THEM BUT WHAT CAN BE BROUGHT TO NOTHING IS CORRUPTIBLE THEREFORE SINCE THE ANGELS WERE MADE BY GOD IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THEY ARE CORRUPTIBLE OF THEIR OWN NATURE ON THE CONTRARY
3009-10327-0080 HAVE UNFAILING LIFE BEING FREE FROM ALL CORRUPTION DEATH MATTER AND GENERATION I ANSWER THAT IT MUST NECESSARILY BE MAINTAINED THAT THE ANGELS ARE INCORRUPTIBLE
3009-10327-0081 OF THEIR OWN NATURE THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT NOTHING IS CORRUPTED EXCEPT BY ITS FORM BEING SEPARATED FROM THE MATTER HENCE SINCE AN ANGEL IS A SUBSISTING FORM
3009-10327-0082 TO BE CORRUPTIBLE FOR WHAT BELONGS TO ANYTHING CONSIDERED IN ITSELF CAN NEVER BE SEPARATED FROM IT BUT WHAT BELONGS TO A THING CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO SOMETHING ELSE CAN BE SEPARATED WHEN THAT SOMETHING ELSE IS TAKEN AWAY
3009-10327-0083 IN VIEW OF WHICH IT BELONGED TO IT ROUNDNESS CAN NEVER BE TAKEN FROM THE CIRCLE BECAUSE IT BELONGS TO IT OF ITSELF BUT A BRONZE CIRCLE CAN LOSE ROUNDNESS IF THE BRONZE BE DEPRIVED OF ITS CIRCULAR SHAPE NOW TO BE
3009-10327-0084 BELONGS TO A FORM CONSIDERED IN ITSELF FOR EVERYTHING IS AN ACTUAL BEING ACCORDING TO ITS FORM WHEREAS MATTER IS AN ACTUAL BEING BY THE FORM CONSEQUENTLY A SUBJECT COMPOSED OF MATTER AND FORM
3009-10327-0085 CEASES TO BE ACTUALLY WHEN THE FORM IS SEPARATED FROM THE MATTER BUT IF THE FORM SUBSISTS IN ITS OWN BEING AS HAPPENS
3009-10327-0086 THEREFORE THE ANGEL'S IMMATERIALITY IS THE CAUSE WHY IT IS INCORRUPTIBLE BY ITS OWN NATURE A TOKEN OF THIS INCORRUPTIBILITY CAN BE GATHERED FROM ITS INTELLECTUAL OPERATION
3009-10327-0087 FOR SINCE EVERYTHING ACTS ACCORDING AS IT IS ACTUAL THE OPERATION OF A THING INDICATES ITS MODE OF BEING NOW THE SPECIES AND NATURE OF THE OPERATION IS UNDERSTOOD FROM THE OBJECT BUT AN INTELLIGIBLE OBJECT
3009-10327-0088 BEING ABOVE TIME IS EVERLASTING HENCE EVERY INTELLECTUAL SUBSTANCE IS INCORRUPTIBLE OF ITS OWN NATURE
3009-10327-0089 DAMASCENE IS DEALING WITH PERFECT IMMORTALITY WHICH INCLUDES COMPLETE IMMUTABILITY SINCE EVERY CHANGE IS A KIND OF DEATH
3009-10327-0090 BY THE EXPRESSION GODS PLATO UNDERSTANDS THE HEAVENLY BODIES WHICH HE SUPPOSED TO BE MADE UP OF ELEMENTS AND THEREFORE DISSOLUBLE OF THEIR OWN NATURE YET THEY ARE FOR EVER PRESERVED IN EXISTENCE BY THE DIVINE WILL
