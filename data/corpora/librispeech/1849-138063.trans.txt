1849-138063-0000 THE HORSEMEN DISMOUNTED AND TOGETHER WITH THE MEN ON FOOT WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY TAKING UP SANCHO AND DON QUIXOTE BODILY THEY CARRIED THEM INTO THE COURT
1849-138063-0001 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COURT WAS A CATAFALQUE RAISED ABOUT TWO YARDS ABOVE THE GROUND AND COVERED COMPLETELY BY AN IMMENSE CANOPY OF BLACK VELVET AND ON THE STEPS ALL ROUND IT WHITE WAX TAPERS
1849-138063-0002 BURNED IN MORE THAN A HUNDRED SILVER CANDLESTICKS UPON THE CATAFALQUE WAS SEEN THE DEAD BODY OF A DAMSEL SO LOVELY THAT BY HER BEAUTY SHE MADE DEATH ITSELF LOOK BEAUTIFUL
1849-138063-0003 SHE LAY WITH HER HEAD RESTING UPON A CUSHION OF BROCADE AND CROWNED WITH A GARLAND OF SWEET SMELLING FLOWERS OF DIVERS SORTS HER HANDS CROSSED UPON HER BOSOM AND BETWEEN THEM A BRANCH OF YELLOW PALM OF VICTORY
1849-138063-0004 ON ONE SIDE OF THE COURT WAS ERECTED A STAGE WHERE UPON TWO CHAIRS WERE SEATED TWO PERSONS WHO FROM HAVING CROWNS ON THEIR HEADS AND SCEPTRES IN THEIR HANDS APPEARED TO BE KINGS OF SOME SORT
1849-138063-0005 WHETHER REAL OR MOCK ONES BY THE SIDE OF THIS STAGE WHICH WAS REACHED BY STEPS WERE TWO OTHER CHAIRS ON WHICH THE MEN CARRYING THE PRISONERS SEATED DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO ALL IN SILENCE
1849-138063-0006 AND NOW TWO PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO WERE AT ONCE RECOGNISED BY DON QUIXOTE AS HIS HOSTS THE DUKE AND DUCHESS ASCENDED THE STAGE ATTENDED BY A NUMEROUS SUITE AND SEATED THEMSELVES ON TWO GORGEOUS CHAIRS
1849-138063-0007 CLOSE TO THE TWO KINGS AS THEY SEEMED TO BE WHO WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AMAZED AT THIS NOR WAS THIS ALL FOR DON QUIXOTE HAD PERCEIVED THAT THE DEAD BODY ON THE CATAFALQUE WAS THAT OF THE FAIR ALTISIDORA
1849-138063-0008 AS THE DUKE AND DUCHESS MOUNTED THE STAGE DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO ROSE AND MADE THEM A PROFOUND OBEISANCE WHICH THEY RETURNED BY BOWING THEIR HEADS SLIGHTLY AT THIS MOMENT AN OFFICIAL CROSSED OVER
1849-138063-0009 AND APPROACHING SANCHO THREW OVER HIM A ROBE OF BLACK BUCKRAM PAINTED ALL OVER WITH FLAMES OF FIRE AND TAKING OFF HIS CAP PUT UPON HIS HEAD A MITRE SUCH AS THOSE UNDERGOING THE SENTENCE OF THE HOLY OFFICE WEAR
1849-138063-0010 AND WHISPERED IN HIS EAR THAT HE MUST NOT OPEN HIS LIPS OR THEY WOULD PUT A GAG UPON HIM OR TAKE HIS LIFE SANCHO SURVEYED HIMSELF FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND SAW HIMSELF ALL ABLAZE WITH FLAMES
1849-138063-0011 BUT AS THEY DID NOT BURN HIM HE DID NOT CARE TWO FARTHINGS FOR THEM HE TOOK OFF THE MITRE AND SEEING PAINTED WITH DEVILS HE PUT IT ON AGAIN SAYING TO HIMSELF WELL SO FAR THOSE DON'T BURN ME
1849-138063-0012 NOR DO THESE CARRY ME OFF DON QUIXOTE SURVEYED HIM TOO AND THOUGH FEAR HAD GOT THE BETTER OF HIS FACULTIES HE COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE THE FIGURE SANCHO PRESENTED
1849-138063-0013 AND NOW FROM UNDERNEATH THE CATAFALQUE SO IT SEEMED THERE ROSE A LOW SWEET SOUND OF FLUTES WHICH COMING UNBROKEN BY HUMAN VOICE FOR THERE SILENCE ITSELF KEPT SILENCE
1849-138063-0014 HAD A SOFT AND LANGUISHING EFFECT THEN BESIDE THE PILLOW OF WHAT SEEMED TO BE THE DEAD BODY SUDDENLY APPEARED A FAIR YOUTH IN A ROMAN HABIT
1849-138063-0015 RETURNS TO LIFE AND IN THIS MAGIC COURT THE DAMES IN SABLES COME TO GRACE THE SCENE AND WHILE HER MATRONS ALL IN SEEMLY SORT MY LADY ROBES IN BAIZE AND BOMBAZINE
1849-138063-0016 HER BEAUTY AND HER SORROWS WILL I SING
1849-138063-0017 THAN TOUCHED THE THRACIAN STRING BUT NOT IN LIFE ALONE METHINKS TO ME BELONGS THE OFFICE LADY WHEN MY TONGUE IS COLD IN DEATH BELIEVE ME UNTO THEE MY VOICE SHALL RAISE ITS TRIBUTARY SONG
1849-138063-0018 MY SOUL FROM THIS STRAIT PRISON HOUSE SET FREE AS O'ER THE STYGIAN LAKE IT FLOATS ALONG THY PRAISES SINGING STILL SHALL HOLD ITS WAY AND MAKE THE WATERS OF OBLIVION STAY
1849-138063-0019 AT THIS POINT ONE OF THE TWO THAT LOOKED LIKE KINGS EXCLAIMED ENOUGH ENOUGH DIVINE SINGER IT WOULD BE AN ENDLESS TASK TO PUT BEFORE US NOW THE DEATH AND THE CHARMS OF THE PEERLESS ALTISIDORA
1849-138063-0020 NOT DEAD AS THE IGNORANT WORLD IMAGINES BUT LIVING IN THE VOICE OF FAME AND IN THE PENANCE WHICH SANCHO PANZA HERE PRESENT HAS TO UNDERGO TO RESTORE HER TO THE LONG LOST LIGHT
1849-138063-0021 DO THOU THEREFORE O RHADAMANTHUS WHO SITTEST IN JUDGMENT WITH ME IN THE MURKY CAVERNS OF DIS AS THOU KNOWEST ALL THAT THE INSCRUTABLE FATES HAVE DECREED TOUCHING THE RESUSCITATION OF THIS DAMSEL
1849-138063-0022 ANNOUNCE AND DECLARE IT AT ONCE THAT THE HAPPINESS WE LOOK FORWARD TO FROM HER RESTORATION BE NO LONGER DEFERRED
1849-138063-0023 THAN RHADAMANTHUS RISING UP SAID HO OFFICIALS OF THIS HOUSE HIGH AND LOW GREAT AND SMALL MAKE HASTE HITHER ONE AND ALL AND PRINT ON SANCHO'S FACE FOUR AND TWENTY SMACKS
1849-138063-0024 AND GIVE HIM TWELVE PINCHES AND SIX PIN THRUSTS IN THE BACK AND ARMS
1849-138063-0025 ON HEARING THIS SANCHO BROKE SILENCE AND CRIED OUT BY ALL THAT'S GOOD I'LL AS SOON LET MY FACE BE SMACKED OR HANDLED AS TURN MOOR BODY O ME
1849-138063-0026 WHAT HAS HANDLING MY FACE GOT TO DO WITH THE RESURRECTION OF THIS DAMSEL THE OLD WOMAN TOOK KINDLY TO THE BLITS THEY ENCHANT DULCINEA AND WHIP ME IN ORDER TO DISENCHANT HER ALTISIDORA DIES OF AILMENTS GOD WAS PLEASED TO SEND HER
1849-138063-0027 AND TO BRING HER TO LIFE AGAIN THEY MUST GIVE ME FOUR AND TWENTY SMACKS AND PRICK HOLES IN MY BODY WITH PINS AND RAISE WEALS ON MY ARMS WITH PINCHES TRY THOSE JOKES ON A BROTHER IN LAW I'M AN OLD DOG AND TUS TUS
1849-138063-0028 THOU MUST BE MADE TO HOWL HO I SAY OFFICIALS OBEY MY ORDERS OR BY THE WORD OF AN HONEST MAN YE SHALL SEE WHAT YE WERE BORN FOR AT THIS SOME SIX DUENNAS
1849-138063-0029 AS IS THE FASHION NOW A DAYS NO SOONER HAD SANCHO CAUGHT SIGHT OF THEM THAN BELLOWING LIKE A BULL HE EXCLAIMED I MIGHT LET MYSELF BE HANDLED BY ALL THE WORLD BUT ALLOW DUENNAS TO TOUCH ME NOT A BIT OF IT
1849-138063-0030 THOUGH THE DEVIL SHOULD CARRY ME OFF HERE DON QUIXOTE TOO BROKE SILENCE SAYING TO SANCHO HAVE PATIENCE MY SON AND GRATIFY THESE NOBLE PERSONS AND GIVE ALL THANKS TO HEAVEN
1849-138063-0031 THAT IT HAS INFUSED SUCH VIRTUE INTO THY PERSON THAT BY ITS SUFFERINGS THOU CANST DISENCHANT THE ENCHANTED AND RESTORE TO LIFE THE DEAD THE DUENNAS WERE NOW CLOSE TO SANCHO AND HE
1849-138063-0032 HAVING BECOME MORE TRACTABLE AND REASONABLE SETTLING HIMSELF WELL IN HIS CHAIR PRESENTED HIS FACE AND BEARD TO THE FIRST WHO DELIVERED HIM A SMACK VERY STOUTLY LAID ON AND THEN MADE HIM A LOW CURTSEY
1849-138063-0033 LESS POLITENESS AND LESS PAINT SENORA DUENNA SAID SANCHO BY GOD YOUR HANDS SMELL OF VINEGAR WASH IN FINE ALL THE DUENNAS SMACKED HIM AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD PINCHED HIM
1849-138063-0034 BUT WHAT HE COULD NOT STAND WAS BEING PRICKED BY THE PINS AND SO APPARENTLY OUT OF PATIENCE HE STARTED UP OUT OF HIS CHAIR AND SEIZING A LIGHTED TORCH THAT STOOD NEAR HIM FELL UPON THE DUENNAS AND THE WHOLE SET OF HIS TORMENTORS EXCLAIMING
1849-138063-0035 BEGONE YE MINISTERS OF HELL I'M NOT MADE OF BRASS NOT TO FEEL SUCH OUT OF THE WAY TORTURES AT THIS INSTANT ALTISIDORA WHO PROBABLY WAS TIRED OF HAVING BEEN SO LONG LYING ON HER BACK
1849-138063-0036 THE DISENCHANTMENT OF DULCINEA NOW I SAY IS THE TIME WHEN THE VIRTUE THAT IS IN THEE IS RIPE AND ENDOWED WITH EFFICACY TO WORK THE GOOD THAT IS LOOKED FOR FROM THEE TO WHICH SANCHO MADE ANSWER
