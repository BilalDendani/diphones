4710-24606-0000 WHEN REVIEWING THE TALES OF MY LANDLORD FOR THE QUARTERLY REVIEW IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN THE PARTICULARS WERE DERIVED BY THE CRITIC FROM THE AUTHOR'S INFORMATION
4710-24606-0001 THEY ARE NOW INSERTED IN THEIR PROPER PLACE THE MUTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED BY WAVERLEY AND TALBOT TO EACH OTHER UPON WHICH THE WHOLE PLOT DEPENDS IS FOUNDED UPON ONE OF THOSE ANECDOTES WHICH SOFTEN THE FEATURES EVEN OF CIVIL WAR
4710-24606-0002 AND AS IT IS EQUALLY HONOURABLE TO THE MEMORY OF BOTH PARTIES WE HAVE NO HESITATION TO GIVE THEIR NAMES AT LENGTH WHEN THE HIGHLANDERS ON THE MORNING OF THE BATTLE OF PRESTON SEVENTEEN FORTY FIVE MADE THEIR MEMORABLE ATTACK ON SIR JOHN COPE'S ARMY
4710-24606-0003 A BATTERY OF FOUR FIELD PIECES WAS STORMED AND CARRIED BY THE CAMERONS AND THE STEWARTS OF APPINE THE LATE ALEXANDER STEWART OF INVERNAHYLEWAS
4710-24606-0004 THE MILLER OF INVERNAHYLE'S MILL WAS UPLIFTED TO DASH HIS BRAINS OUT WHEN MISTER STEWART WITH DIFFICULTY PREVAILED ON HIM TO YIELD HE TOOK CHARGE OF HIS ENEMY'S PROPERTY PROTECTED HIS PERSON AND FINALLY OBTAINED HIM LIBERTY ON HIS PAROLE
4710-24606-0005 THE OFFICER PROVED TO BE COLONEL WHITEFOORD AN AYRSHIRE GENTLEMAN OF HIGH CHARACTER AND INFLUENCE
4710-24606-0006 YET SUCH WAS THE CONFIDENCE EXISTING BETWEEN THESE TWO HONOURABLE MEN THOUGH OF DIFFERENT POLITICAL PRINCIPLES THAT WHILE THE CIVIL WAR WAS RAGING AND STRAGGLING OFFICERS FROM THE HIGHLAND ARMY WERE EXECUTED WITHOUT MERCY INVERNAHYLE HESITATED
4710-24606-0007 NOT TO PAY HIS LATE CAPTIVE A VISIT AS HE RETURNED TO THE HIGHLANDS TO RAISE FRESH RECRUITS ON WHICH OCCASION HE SPENT A DAY OR TWO IN AYRSHIRE AMONG COLONEL WHITEFOORD'S WHIG FRIENDS AS PLEASANTLY AND AS GOOD HUMOUREDLY AS IF ALL HAD BEEN AT PEACE AROUND HIM
4710-24606-0008 TO THE LORD ADVOCATE AND TO ALL THE OFFICERS OF STATE AND EACH APPLICATION WAS ANSWERED BY THE PRODUCTION OF A LIST IN WHICH INVERNAHYLE
4710-24606-0009 APPEARED MARKED WITH THE SIGN OF THE BEAST AS A SUBJECT UNFIT FOR FAVOUR OR PARDON AT LENGTH COLONEL WHITEFOORD APPLIED TO THE DUKE OF CUMBERLAND IN PERSON FROM HIM ALSO HE RECEIVED A POSITIVE REFUSAL
4710-24606-0010 HE THEN LIMITED HIS REQUEST FOR THE PRESENT TO A PROTECTION FOR STEWART'S HOUSE WIFE CHILDREN AND PROPERTY THIS WAS ALSO REFUSED BY THE DUKE ON WHICH COLONEL WHITEFOORD TAKING HIS COMMISSION FROM HIS BOSOM
4710-24606-0011 LAID IT ON THE TABLE BEFORE HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS WITH MUCH EMOTION AND ASKED PERMISSION TO RETIRE FROM THE SERVICE OF A SOVEREIGN WHO DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SPARE A VANQUISHED ENEMY THE DUKE WAS STRUCK AND EVEN AFFECTED HE BADE THE COLONEL TAKE UP HIS COMMISSION
4710-24606-0012 AND GRANTED THE PROTECTION HE REQUIRED IT WAS ISSUED JUST IN TIME TO SAVE THE HOUSE CORN AND CATTLE AT INVERNAHYLE FROM THE TROOPS WHO WERE ENGAGED IN LAYING WASTE WHAT IT WAS THE FASHION TO CALL THE COUNTRY OF THE ENEMY
4710-24606-0013 A SMALL ENCAMPMENT OF SOLDIERS WAS FORMED ON INVERNAHYLE'S PROPERTY WHICH THEY SPARED WHILE PLUNDERING THE COUNTRY AROUND AND SEARCHING IN EVERY DIRECTION FOR THE LEADERS OF THE INSURRECTION AND FOR STEWART IN PARTICULAR
4710-24606-0014 WERE CLOSELY WATCHED WITH INGENUITY BEYOND HER YEARS THE CHILD USED TO STRAY ABOUT AMONG THE SOLDIERS
4710-24606-0015 AND THUS SEIZE THE MOMENT WHEN SHE WAS UNOBSERVED AND STEAL INTO THE THICKET WHEN SHE DEPOSITED WHATEVER SMALL STORE OF PROVISIONS SHE HAD IN CHARGE AT SOME MARKED SPOT WHERE HER FATHER MIGHT FIND IT INVERNAHYLE SUPPORTED LIFE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS BY MEANS OF THESE
4710-24606-0016 BY A PARTY OF THE ENEMY WHO FIRED AT AND PURSUED HIM THE FUGITIVE BEING FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO ESCAPE THEIR SEARCH THEY RETURNED TO THE HOUSE AND CHARGED THE FAMILY WITH HARBOURING ONE OF THE PROSCRIBED TRAITORS
4710-24606-0017 AN OLD WOMAN HAD PRESENCE OF MIND ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN THAT THE MAN THEY HAD SEEN WAS THE SHEPHERD WHY DID HE NOT STOP WHEN WE CALLED TO HIM SAID THE SOLDIER HE IS AS DEAF POOR MAN
4710-24606-0018 AS A PEAT STACK ANSWERED THE READY WITTED DOMESTIC LET HIM BE SENT FOR DIRECTLY THE REAL SHEPHERD ACCORDINGLY WAS BROUGHT FROM THE HILL AND AS THERE WAS TIME TO TUTOR HIM BY THE WAY
4710-24606-0019 INVERNAHYLE WAS AFTERWARDS PARDONED UNDER THE ACT OF INDEMNITY THE AUTHOR KNEW HIM WELL AND HAS OFTEN HEARD THESE CIRCUMSTANCES FROM HIS OWN MOUTH HE WAS A NOBLE SPECIMEN OF THE OLD HIGHLANDER FAR DESCENDED GALLANT
4710-24606-0020 WAS AN ACTIVE PARTAKER IN ALL THE STIRRING SCENES WHICH PASSED IN THE HIGHLANDS BETWIXT THESE MEMORABLE ERAS AND I HAVE HEARD WAS REMARKABLE AMONG OTHER EXPLOITS FOR HAVING FOUGHT A DUEL WITH THE BROADSWORD WITH THE CELEBRATED ROB ROY MAC GREGOR
4710-24606-0021 AT THE CLACHAN OF BALQUIDDER INVERNAHYLE CHANCED TO BE IN EDINBURGH WHEN PAUL JONES CAME INTO THE FIRTH OF FORTH AND THOUGH THEN AN OLD MAN I SAW HIM IN ARMS AND HEARD HIM EXULT TO USE HIS OWN WORDS
4710-24606-0022 IN THE PROSPECT OF DRAWING HIS CLAYMORE ONCE MORE BEFORE HE DIED IN FACT ON THAT MEMORABLE OCCASION WHEN THE CAPITAL OF SCOTLAND WAS MENACED BY THREE TRIFLING SLOOPS OR BRIGS
4710-24606-0023 HE WAS THE ONLY MAN WHO SEEMED TO PROPOSE A PLAN OF RESISTANCE HE OFFERED TO THE MAGISTRATES IF BROADSWORDS AND DIRKS COULD BE OBTAINED TO FIND AS MANY HIGHLANDERS AMONG THE LOWER CLASSES AS WOULD CUT OFF ANY BOAT'S CREW
4710-24606-0024 IN QUEST OF PLUNDER I KNOW NOT IF HIS PLAN WAS ATTENDED TO I RATHER THINK IT SEEMED TOO HAZARDOUS TO THE CONSTITUTED AUTHORITIES WHO MIGHT NOT EVEN AT THAT TIME DESIRE TO SEE ARMS IN HIGHLAND HANDS
4710-24606-0025 A STEADY AND POWERFUL WEST WIND SETTLED THE MATTER BY SWEEPING PAUL JONES AND HIS VESSELS OUT OF THE FIRTH IF THERE IS SOMETHING DEGRADING IN THIS RECOLLECTION IT IS NOT UNPLEASANT
4710-24606-0026 BESIDES REGULAR FORCES AND MILITIA FURNISHED A VOLUNTEER BRIGADE OF CAVALRY INFANTRY AND ARTILLERY TO THE AMOUNT OF SIX THOUSAND MEN AND UPWARDS WHICH WAS IN READINESS TO MEET AND REPEL A FORCE OF A FAR MORE FORMIDABLE DESCRIPTION
4710-24606-0027 AND MANLY CHARACTER OF A COUNTRY WILLING TO ENTRUST ITS OWN PROTECTION TO THE ARMS OF ITS CHILDREN AFTER HAVING BEEN OBSCURED FOR HALF A CENTURY HAS DURING THE COURSE OF HIS OWN LIFETIME RECOVERED ITS LUSTRE
