6311-63718-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE COLONEL IS SURPRISED THIS SAID COLONEL ASHLEY TO HIMSELF AS HE GLIDED RAPIDLY ALONG THE STREET IS VERY MUCH LIKE OLD TIMES VERY MUCH
6311-63718-0001 I NEVER EXPECTED TO DO ANY SHADOWING AGAIN WHAT'S THAT WALTON SAYS ABOUT MAN PROPOSING AND PROVIDENCE DISPOSING OR WAS IT WALTON I MUST LOOK IT UP MEANWHILE CONTINUING HIS MUSING
6311-63718-0002 AND WITH A SATISFIED SMILE ON HIS FACE A SMILE THAT MIGHT INDICATE THAT THE COLONEL WAS NOT SO VERY MUCH AVERSE TO GIVING OVER HIS FISHING FOR THE TIME BEING TO TAKE UP HIS PROFESSION ONCE MORE HE FOLLOWED AARON GRAFTON AS THE MERCHANT LEFT THE JEWELRY STORE
6311-63718-0003 MUSED THE COLONEL WHAT HIS OBJECT WAS IN COMING TO THE DARCY PLACE AND NOSING AROUND AS HE DID THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME OBJECT A MAN SUCH AS HE IS DOESN'T DO THINGS LIKE THAT FOR FUN AND IT WASN'T MERE CURIOSITY EITHER
6311-63718-0004 IF IT WAS HE'D HAVE BEEN AT THE PLACE BEFORE WHEN THE EVIDENCES OF THE CRIME WERE THERE TO BE STARED AT BY THOSE WHO CARE FOR SUCH THINGS AND THAT AARON GRAFTON HASN'T BEEN THERE SINCE I WAS FORCED INTO THIS THING I'M POSITIVE FOR I WAS FORCED INTO IT
6311-63718-0005 GRUMBLED THE OLD DETECTIVE I JUST COULDN'T RESIST THE PLEADING OF HER EYES
6311-63718-0006 BUT NO MATTER I MUST SEE WHAT FRIEND AARON IS UP TO AND WHAT HIS LITTLE GAME IS
6311-63718-0007 BEFORE I ARRIVED I MUST ASK DARCY ABOUT THAT POOR LAD HE'S IN TOUGH LUCK JUST WHEN HE OUGHT TO BE THINKING OF GETTING MARRIED WELL I'LL DO WHAT I CAN
6311-63718-0008 THERE WERE FEW TRICKS KNOWN TO MODERN DETECTIVES OF WHICH COLONEL ASHLEY WAS NOT MASTER AMONG THEM BEING THE ABILITY TO DISGUISE HIMSELF NOT BY CLUMSY BEARDS AND FALSE MOUSTACHES THOUGH HE USED THEM AT TIMES
6311-63718-0009 BUT BY A FEW SIMPLE ALTERATIONS TO HIS FACE AND CARRIAGE OF COURSE COSTUME PLAYED ITS PART WHEN NEEDED BUT THE TIME HAD NOT YET COME FOR THAT
6311-63718-0010 HE WAS NOW FOLLOWING GRAFTON WITHOUT THE LATTER BEING AWARE OF IT NO VERY DIFFICULT MATTER IN A CITY THE SIZE OF COLCHESTER AND ON ONE OF ITS MAIN STREETS I THINK I WANT TO KNOW A LITTLE MORE ABOUT HIM MUSED THE COLONEL
6311-63718-0011 HAVING FOLLOWED HIS MAN TO THE LATTER'S STORE AND EVEN INSIDE IT WHERE HE MADE A TRIFLING PURCHASE AND HAVING SEEN MISTER GRAFTON ENTER HIS PRIVATE OFFICE THE DETECTIVE PAID A VISIT TO DARCY IN THE JAIL HOW IS SHE COLONEL
6311-63718-0012 WERE THE FIRST WORDS OF THE PRISONER WHEN THEY WERE IN THE WARDEN'S OFFICE WITH A DETECTIVE FROM THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE SEATED A FEW CHAIRS AWAY IT WAS ONLY UNDER SUCH ARRANGEMENTS THAT VISITORS WERE ALLOWED TO SEE THE JEWELRY WORKER HOW IS AMY
6311-63718-0013 BUT I CAME TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE I SUPPOSE SO THIS HORRIBLE AFFAIR BUT SHE STILL BELIEVES IN ME DOESN'T SHE HE ASKED EAGERLY
6311-63718-0014 MAYBE IT WON'T BE FOR LONG
6311-63718-0015 I SHAN'T MIND IF I'M PROVED INNOCENT AT LAST I HOPE WE CAN MANAGE THAT ALL RIGHT THEN YOU DO BELIEVE IN ME COLONEL OF COURSE I DO OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T TAKE UP YOUR CASE
6311-63718-0016 ANSWER THEM AND AS BRIEFLY AS POSSIBLE I'LL GET YOU OUT OF HERE AS SOON AS I CAN IF I HADN'T BEEN AS SLOW AS A CARP I MIGHT HAVE THE RIGHT MAN HERE NOW IN YOUR PLACE
6311-63718-0017 EH WHAT'S THAT DID I SAY ANYTHING AND THE DETECTIVE SEEMED ROUSED FROM A REVERIE FOR HE HAD SPOKEN HIS LAST REMARKS IN A LOW VOICE YOU SPOKE ABOUT A CARP THE RIGHT MAN OH I
6311-63718-0018 NOW TO BUSINESS AND THE COLONEL DREW SOME PAPERS FROM HIS POCKET DARCY LOOKED AT HIS NEW FRIEND IN SOME SURPRISE CERTAINLY THE COLONEL HAD SPOKEN AS THOUGH HE MIGHT AT ONE TIME HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO GET THE RIGHT MAN DID THAT MEAN THE REAL MURDERER
6311-63718-0019 DARCY SHOOK HIS HEAD HIS NERVES WERE BEGINNING TO GO BACK ON HIM HE FEARED DO YOU KNOW AARON GRAFTON ASKED THE COLONEL OH YES REPLIED DARCY EVERY ONE IN TOWN KNOWS HIM AS ONE OF THE PROMINENT MERCHANTS WAS HE AT THE STORE THE DAY OF THE
6311-63718-0020 THE DAY MISSUS DARCY WAS KILLED I DON'T REMEMBER SO MANY THINGS HAPPENED THERE WERE SO MANY IN THE PLACE AS I THINK BACK THOUGH I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM
6311-63718-0021 VERY GOOD DID HE EVER DO ANY BUSINESS WITH YOU I MEAN BUY ANYTHING IN THE STORE WHY YES I THINK VERY POSSIBLY HE MIGHT
6311-63718-0022 HOW ABOUT HAVING HIS WATCH REPAIRED I'D REMEMBER I THINK IF I HAD FIXED HIS WATCH I'M SURE I DIDN'T HE HAS A FINE ONE FOR I'VE SEEN HIM STOP IN FRONT OF OUR WINDOW AND COMPARE HIS TIME WITH OUR CHRONOMETER I SEE NOW ANOTHER MATTER
6311-63718-0023 CAN YOU IN ANY WAY ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT SO MANY OF THE CLOCKS IN THE STORE CLOCKS THAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT ORDINARILY GO FOR MANY DAYS STOPPED AT DIFFERENT HOURS THE NIGHT OF THE KILLING CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT SOMEWHAT TO THE SURPRISE OF THE COLONEL DARCY WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT
6311-63718-0024 THEN THE YOUNG MAN SLOWLY ANSWERED NO NO I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT DID IT WELL THEN I'LL HAVE TO FISH ON THAT ALONE I GUESS I THOUGHT YOU KNOWING A LOT ABOUT CLOCK WORKS MIGHT HAVE SOME EXPLANATION
6311-63718-0025 YOU KNOW MOST OF THE TIMEPIECES WERE STOPPED ALL OF THEM IN FACT EXCEPT THE WATCH IN YOUR COUSIN'S HAND YES I REMARKED THAT AT THE TIME THAT WATCH WAS GOING YES SO YOU TOLD ME YOU THOUGHT IT WAS HER HEART BEATING I WISH OH
6311-63718-0026 HOW I WISH IT HAD BEEN EXCLAIMED DARCY IN TONES OF DESPAIR
6311-63718-0027 BUT IT'S TOO LATE TO THINK OF THAT NOW DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHAT BECAME OF THAT WATCH THE ONE IN HER HAND IT BELONGED TO AN EAST INDIAN YOU SAID YES TO SINGA PHUT
6311-63718-0028 I WAS TO MAKE ONE LITTLE ADJUSTMENT IN IT FOR HIM AND HE WAS TO COME IN EARLY TO GET IT IT WASN'T MUCH THE HAIR SPRING I THINK HAD BECOME CAUGHT UP AND IT RAN VERY FAST
6311-63718-0029 BUT I NEVER GOT THE CHANCE NO I DON'T RECALL WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT WATCH I SUPPOSE THE DETECTIVES HAVE IT
6311-63718-0030 HE HAS CRIED DARCY YES HE CALLED AT THE COURT HOUSE AND BEGGED THAT IT BE GIVEN TO HIM SAID IT WAS AN ANCIENT TIMEPIECE WHICH HE HAD OWNED FOR MANY YEARS AND AS IT COULD HAVE NO CONNECTION WITH THE CRIME THEY LET HIM TAKE IT OH
6311-63718-0031 WELL I SUPPOSE THAT WAS ALL RIGHT NO SINGA PHUT DIDN'T HAVE A THING TO DO WITH THE KILLING I'M POSITIVE OF THAT AND HIS ALIBI IS PERFECT SAID THE COLONEL WELL I GUESS YOU'VE TOLD ME ALL I WANT TO KNOW
6311-63718-0032 YOU HAVEN'T ANY REASON TO SUSPECT ANY ONE HAVE YOU DARCY NOT A SOUL GOD KNOWS I WOULDN'T WANT TO NAME ANY ONE EITHER MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO GET OUT OF HERE MYSELF MISSUS DARCY HAD NO ENEMIES
6311-63718-0033 NOT A ONE IN THE WORLD THAT I KNOW OF SHE WAS A FRIENDLY WOMAN OF COURSE THAT WAS GOOD BUSINESS POLICY NO SHE HAD NO ENEMIES MOST PEOPLE LIKED HER SO I'VE HEARD WELL WE'LL GET AT THE TRUTH SOMEHOW NOW BRACE UP
6311-63718-0034 LAUGHING AND DARCY DID MANAGE TO UTTER WHAT MIGHT PASS FOR A LAUGH IT WAS A GOOD ATTEMPT
6311-63718-0035 THOUGH THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT SAID THE DETECTIVE NOW I'LL LEAVE YOU I HAVE LOTS TO DO I'M SORRY COLONEL TO PUT YOU TO ALL THIS TROUBLE POOH NOW I'M IN IT THERE'S NO TROUBLE THAT'S TOO MUCH I'LL GET ABOUT THE SAME FUN OUT OF THIS AS I WOULD IF I FISHED
6311-63718-0036 AND I'LL FISH WITH GREATER ENJOYMENT LATER ON WHEN I'VE CLEARED YOU I HOPE YOU DO COLONEL AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO THANKS BUT MISS MASON HAS ALREADY ARRANGED TO HAVE ME WHIP HER FATHER'S TROUT STREAM WHEN THIS CASE IS OVER
6311-63718-0037 AND THE COLONEL ASSUMED THE MILITARY APPEARANCE THAT SO WELL BEFITTED HIM STOP WORRYING I'LL TRY COLONEL DON'T TRY DO IT ONE QUESTION WELL ONE ONLY WHAT IS IT DO YOU THINK MISTER GRAFTON
6311-63718-0038 THE DETECTIVE SMILED AND SHOOK HIS FINGER AT DARCY YOU JUST LET ME DO THE THINKING HE ADVISED AS HE TURNED TO GO OUT COLONEL ASHLEY SPENT TWO BUSY DAYS MOST OF HIS TIME BEING GIVEN OVER TO INVESTIGATING AARON GRAFTON
6311-63718-0039 AND THE MORE HE SAW OF THAT GENTLEMAN THE MORE THE DETECTIVE BECAME CONVINCED THAT THE MERCHANT KNEW SOMETHING OF THE CRIME
6311-63718-0040 I WOULDN'T ADMIT EVEN TO MYSELF MUSED THE COLONEL THAT HE HAD A HAND IN IT OR THAT HE WAS AN ACCESSORY BEFORE OR AFTER BUT HE CERTAINLY KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM WORRY THAT'S WHAT AARON GRAFTON IS DOING WORRYING
6311-63718-0041 AND HE'S WORRYING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT OUGHT TO BE IN THE JEWELRY SHOP AND ISN'T NOW WHAT IS IT THIS VERY EVIDENTLY WAS SOMETHING FOR COLONEL ASHLEY TO DISCOVER AND WITH ALL HIS SKILL HE SET HIMSELF TO THIS TASK
6311-63718-0042 FOR THE TIME BEING HE DROPPED SEVERAL OTHER ENDS TANGLED ENDS OF THE SKEIN HE HOPED TO UNRAVEL AND DEVOTED HIS TIME TO GRAFTON AND AT THE END OF TWO DAYS THE DETECTIVE LEARNED THAT THE MERCHANT WAS GOING TO MAKE A HURRIED TRIP TO NEW YORK
6311-63718-0043 A TRIP NOT DIRECTLY CONNECTED WITH HIS STORE FOR THOSE TRIPS WERE MADE AT OTHER TIMES OF THE YEAR WELL IF HE GOES TO NEW YORK I GO TOO SAID THE COLONEL GRIMLY AND HE WENT ON THE SAME TRAIN WITH AARON GRAFTON THOUGH UNKNOWN TO THE LATTER
6311-63718-0044 IT WAS A SKILFUL BIT OF SHADOWING THE DETECTIVE DID ON THE JOURNEY TO THE METROPOLIS SO SKILFUL THAT THOUGH THE MERCHANT PLAINLY SHOWED BY HIS NERVOUSNESS THAT HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED HE DID NOT SEEMINGLY SUSPECT THE QUIET MAN SEATED NOT FAR FROM HIM
6311-63718-0045 READING A LITTLE GREEN BOOK THE COLONEL HAD ADOPTED A SIMPLE BUT EFFECTIVE DISGUISE IN NEW YORK WHICH WAS REACHED EARLY IN THE MORNING AFTER A NIGHT JOURNEY THE COLONEL AGAIN TOOK UP THE TRAIL KEEPING NEAR HIS MAN
6311-63718-0046 FOLLOW THAT TAXI THE COLONEL ORDERED THE DRIVER OF HIS MACHINE AS IT ROLLED OUT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA STATION JUST A FEW LENGTHS BEHIND THE ONE IN WHICH GRAFTON RODE
6311-63718-0047 THE FOLLOWING WAS WELL DONE AND A LITTLE LATER THE TWO MACHINES DREW UP IN FRONT OF THE BIG OFFICE BUILDING IN WHICH COLONEL ASHLEY HAD HIS HEADQUARTERS WHEW
6311-63718-0048 HE DOES WANT TO SEE ME EXCITEDLY THOUGHT THE COLONEL WHAT IN THE WORLD FOR THIS IS GETTING INTERESTING I'VE GOT TO DO A LITTLE FINE WORK NOW HE MUST NEVER SUSPECT AT LEAST FOR A WHILE THAT I HAVE BEEN IN COLCHESTER
6311-63718-0049 NEXT TO THE ELEVATOR IN WHICH AARON GRAFTON RODE UP WAS ANOTHER TOM YOU'RE AN EXPRESS FOR THE TIME BEING WHISPERED THE COLONEL TO THE OPERATOR THERE'S A MAN HEADED FOR MY OFFICES AND I MUST GET IN AHEAD OF HIM HERE'S A DOLLAR I GET YOU COLONEL
6311-63718-0050 SHOOT AND THE CAR SHOT UP WITH SPEED ENOUGH TO CAUSE THE COLONEL TO GASP USED AS HE WAS TO RAPID MOTION
