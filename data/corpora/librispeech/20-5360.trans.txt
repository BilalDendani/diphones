20-5360-0000 IN ONE OF THE COMFORTABLE SITTING ROOMS OF EAST LYNNE SAT MISTER CARLYLE AND HIS SISTER ONE INCLEMENT JANUARY NIGHT THE CONTRAST WITHIN AND WITHOUT WAS GREAT THE WARM BLAZING FIRE THE HANDSOME CARPET ON WHICH IT FLICKERED
20-5360-0001 THE EXCEEDINGLY COMFORTABLE ARRANGEMENT OF THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOM ALTOGETHER AND THE LIGHT OF THE CHANDELIER WHICH FELL ON ALL PRESENTED A PICTURE OF HOME PEACE THOUGH IT MAY NOT HAVE DESERVED THE NAME OF LUXURY WITHOUT
20-5360-0002 HEAVY FLAKES OF SNOW WERE FALLING THICKLY FLAKES AS LARGE AND NEARLY AS HEAVY AS A CROWN PIECE RENDERING THE ATMOSPHERE SO DENSE AND OBSCURE THAT A MAN COULD NOT SEE A YARD BEFORE HIM MISTER CARLYLE HAD DRIVEN HOME IN THE PONY CARRIAGE
20-5360-0003 AND THE SNOW HAD SO SETTLED UPON HIM THAT LUCY WHO HAPPENED TO SEE HIM AS HE ENTERED THE HALL SCREAMED OUT LAUGHINGLY
20-5360-0004 IT WAS NOW LATER IN THE EVENING THE CHILDREN WERE IN BED
20-5360-0005 IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT MISS CARLYLE INVITED HER TO THEIRS OF AN EVENING AND THE HOUSE WAS QUITE MISTER CARLYLE WAS DEEP IN THE PAGES OF ONE OF THE MONTHLY PERIODICALS AND MISS CARLYLE SAT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIRE GRUMBLING
20-5360-0006 AND GRUNTING AND SNIFFLING AND CHOKING MISS CARLYLE WAS ONE OF YOUR STRONG MINDED LADIES WHO NEVER CONDESCENDED TO BE ILL OF COURSE HAD SHE BEEN ATTACKED WITH SCARLET FEVER OR PARALYSIS OR SAINT VITUS DANCE
20-5360-0007 SHE MUST HAVE GIVEN IN TO THE ENEMY BUT TRIFLING AILMENTS SUCH AS HEADACHE INFLUENZA SORE THROAT WHICH OTHER PEOPLE GET PASSED HER BY IMAGINE THEREFORE HER EXASPERATION AT FINDING HER HEAD STUFFED UP
20-5360-0008 HER CHEST SORE AND HER VOICE GOING IN SHORT AT HAVING FOR ONCE IN HER LIFE CAUGHT A COLD LIKE ORDINARY MORTALS WHAT'S THE TIME I WONDER SHE EXCLAIMED
20-5360-0009 MISTER CARLYLE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH IT IS JUST NINE CORNELIA THEN I THINK I SHALL GO TO BED I'LL HAVE A BASIN OF ARROWROOT OR GRUEL OR SOME SLOP OF THAT SORT AFTER I'M IN IT
20-5360-0010 I'M SURE I HAVE BEEN FREE ENOUGH ALL MY LIFE FROM REQUIRING SUCH SICK DISHES DO SO SAID MISTER CARLYLE IT MAY DO YOU GOOD
20-5360-0011 OR ANY OTHER LARGE PIECE OF FLANNEL YOU MAY CONVENIENTLY HAVE AT HAND AND PUT IT ON OVER YOUR NIGHT CAP I'LL TRY IT I WOULD SAID MISTER CARLYLE SMOTHERING AN IRREVERENT LAUGH
20-5360-0012 SHE SAT ON FIVE MINUTES LONGER AND THEN LEFT WISHING MISTER CARLYLE GOOD NIGHT HE RESUMED HIS READING BUT ANOTHER PAGE OR TWO CONCLUDED THE ARTICLE UPON WHICH MISTER CARLYLE THREW THE BOOK ON THE TABLE
20-5360-0013 ROSE AND STRETCHED HIMSELF AS IF TIRED OF SITTING HE STIRRED THE FIRE INTO A BRIGHTER BLAZE AND STOOD ON THE HEARTHRUG I WONDER IF IT SNOWS STILL HE EXCLAIMED TO HIMSELF
20-5360-0014 PROCEEDING TO THE WINDOW ONE OF THOSE OPENING TO THE GROUND HE THREW ASIDE THE HALF OF THE WARM CRIMSON CURTAIN IT ALL LOOKED DULL AND DARK OUTSIDE MISTER CARLYLE COULD SEE LITTLE WHAT THE WEATHER WAS
20-5360-0015 AND HE OPENED THE WINDOW AND STEPPED HALF OUT THE SNOW WAS FALLING FASTER AND THICKER THAN EVER NOT AT THAT DID MISTER CARLYLE START WITH SURPRISE IF NOT WITH A MORE UNPLEASANT SENSATION
20-5360-0016 BUT A FEELING A MAN'S HAND TOUCH HIS AND AT FINDING A MAN'S FACE NEARLY IN CONTACT WITH HIS OWN LET ME COME IN MISTER CARLYLE FOR THE LOVE OF LIFE I SEE YOU ARE ALONE
20-5360-0017 THE TONES STRUCK FAMILIARLY ON MISTER CARLYLE'S EAR HE DREW BACK MECHANICALLY A THOUSAND PERPLEXING SENSATIONS OVERWHELMING HIM AND THE MAN FOLLOWED HIM INTO THE ROOM A WHITE MAN AS LUCY CALLED HER FATHER
20-5360-0018 AYE FOR HE HAD BEEN HOURS AND HOURS ON FOOT IN THE SNOW HIS HAT HIS CLOTHES HIS EYEBROWS
20-5360-0019 LOCK THE DOOR SIR WERE HIS FIRST WORDS NEED YOU BE TOLD THAT IT WAS RICHARD HARE MISTER CARLYLE FASTENED THE WINDOW DREW THE HEAVY CURTAINS ACROSS AND TURNED RAPIDLY TO LOCK THE TWO DOORS

20-5360-0031 RICHARD HARE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND MY PROOFS OF HIS GUILT MISTER CARLYLE I COULD BRING NONE AGAINST HIM NO POSITIVE ONES
20-5360-0032 HE WOULD TURN ROUND UPON ME NOW AND SWEAR MY LIFE AWAY TO MURDER WELL I THOUGHT I'D ASCERTAIN FOR CERTAIN WHAT HIS NAME WAS AND THAT NIGHT I WENT TO THE HOUSE AND GOT INTO CONVERSATION WITH ONE OF THE SERVANTS WHO WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR

20-5360-0040 IN A WEEK'S TIME I CAME UPON HIM AGAIN IT WAS AT NIGHT HE WAS COMING OUT OF ONE OF THE THEATRES AND I WENT UP AND STOOD BEFORE HIM WHAT DO YOU WANT FELLOW HE ASKED I HAVE SEEN YOU WATCHING ME BEFORE THIS
20-5360-0041 I WANT TO KNOW YOUR NAME I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME AT PRESENT HE FLEW INTO A PASSION AND SWORE THAT IF EVER HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF ME NEAR HIM AGAIN HE WOULD HAND ME OVER INTO CUSTODY
20-5360-0042 AND REMEMBER MEN ARE NOT GIVEN INTO CUSTODY FOR WATCHING OTHERS HE SIGNIFICANTLY ADDED I KNOW YOU AND IF YOU HAVE ANY REGARD FOR YOURSELF YOU'LL KEEP OUT OF MY WAY
20-5360-0043 HE HAD GOT INTO A PRIVATE CARRIAGE AS HE SPOKE AND IT DROVE AWAY I COULD SEE THAT IT HAD A GREAT COAT OF ARMS UPON IT WHEN DO YOU SAY THIS WAS A WEEK AGO
20-5360-0044 WELL I COULD NOT REST I WAS HALF MAD I SAY AND WENT ABOUT STILL TRYING IF I COULD NOT DISCOVER HIS NAME AND WHO HE WAS I DID COME UPON HIM BUT HE WAS WALKING QUICKLY ARM IN ARM WITH WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN
20-5360-0045 AGAIN I SAW HIM STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE BETTING ROOMS TALKING TO THE SAME GENTLEMAN AND HIS FACE TURNED SAVAGE I BELIEVE WITH FEAR AS MUCH AS ANGER WHEN HE DISCERNED ME HE SEEMED TO HESITATE AND THEN AS IF HE ACTED IN A PASSION
20-5360-0046 SUDDENLY BECKONED TO A POLICEMAN POINTED ME OUT AND SAID SOMETHING TO HIM IN A FAST TONE THAT FRIGHTENED ME AND I SLIPPED AWAY TWO HOURS AFTER WHEN I WAS IN QUITE A DIFFERENT PART OF THE TOWN IN TURNING MY HEAD I SAW THE SAME POLICEMAN FOLLOWING ME
20-5360-0047 I BOLTED UNDER THE HORSES OF A PASSING VEHICLE DOWN SOME TURNINGS AND PASSAGES OUT INTO ANOTHER STREET AND UP BESIDE A CABMAN WHO WAS ON HIS BOX DRIVING A FARE PAST I REACHED MY LODGINGS IN SAFETY AS I THOUGHT
20-5360-0048 BUT HAPPENING TO GLANCE INTO THE STREET THERE I SAW THE MAN AGAIN STANDING OPPOSITE AND RECONNOITERING THE HOUSE I HAD GONE HOME HUNGRY BUT THIS TOOK ALL MY HUNGER AWAY FROM ME I OPENED THE BOX WHERE I KEPT MY DISGUISE
20-5360-0049 I HAVE BEEN PRETTY NEARLY EVER SINCE ON MY FEET REACHING HERE I ONLY GOT A LIFT NOW AND THEN BUT RICHARD DO YOU KNOW THAT WEST LYNNE IS THE VERY WORST PLACE YOU COULD HAVE FLOWN TO
20-5360-0050 IT HAS COME TO LIGHT THAT YOU WERE HERE BEFORE DISGUISED AS A FARM LABORER
20-5360-0051 I SHALL FIX MYSELF IN SOME OTHER BIG TOWN FAR AWAY FROM LONDON LIVERPOOL OR MANCHESTER PERHAPS AND SEE WHAT EMPLOYMENT I CAN GET INTO
20-5360-0052 I DON'T POSSESS A PENNY PIECE HE ADDED DRAWING OUT HIS TROUSERS POCKETS FOR THE INSPECTION OF MISTER CARLYLE THE LAST COPPERS I HAD THREE PENCE I SPENT IN BREAD AND CHEESE AND HALF A PINT OF BEER AT MIDDAY
20-5360-0053 I HAVE BEEN OUTSIDE THAT WINDOW FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR SIR INDEED AND AS I NEARED WEST LYNNE I BEGAN TO THINK WHAT I SHOULD DO IT WAS NO USE IN ME TRYING TO CATCH BARBARA'S ATTENTION
20-5360-0054 SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS I HAD NO MONEY TO PAY FOR A LODGING
20-5360-0055 DROP UPON YOU THERE WAS A LITTLE PARTITION IN THE WINDOW CURTAIN IT HAD NOT BEEN DRAWN CLOSE AND THROUGH IT I COULD SEE YOU AND MISS CARLYLE I SAW HER LEAVE THE ROOM I SAW YOU COME TO THE WINDOW AND OPEN IT AND THEN I SPOKE
20-5360-0056 MISTER CARLYLE HE ADDED AFTER A PAUSE IS THIS LIFE TO GO ON WITH ME FOREVER I AM DEEPLY SORRY FOR YOU RICHARD WAS THE SYMPATHIZING ANSWER I WISH I COULD REMEDY IT
20-5360-0057 BEFORE ANOTHER WORD WAS SPOKEN THE ROOM DOOR WAS TRIED AND THEN GENTLY KNOCKED AT MISTER CARLYLE PLACED HIS HAND ON RICHARD WHO WAS LOOKING SCARED OUT OF HIS WITS
20-5360-0058 NO ONE SHALL COME IN IT IS ONLY PETER NOT PETER'S VOICE HOWEVER BUT JOYCE'S WAS HEARD IN RESPONSE TO MISTER CARLYLE'S DEMAND OF WHO WAS THERE
20-5360-0059 MISS CARLYLE HAS LEFT HER HANDKERCHIEF DOWNSTAIRS SIR AND HAS SENT ME FOR IT YOU CANNOT COME IN I AM BUSY WAS THE ANSWER DELIVERED IN A CLEAR AND MOST DECISIVE TONE
20-5360-0060 WHO WAS IT QUIVERED RICHARD AS JOYCE WAS HEARD GOING AWAY IT WAS JOYCE WHAT IS SHE HERE STILL
20-5360-0061 AFY WAS HERE HERSELF TWO OR THREE MONTHS AGO WAS SHE THOUGH UTTERED RICHARD BEGUILED FOR AN INSTANT FROM THE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN DANGER WHAT IS SHE DOING SHE IS IN SERVICE AS A LADY'S MAID
20-5360-0062 RICHARD I QUESTIONED AFY ABOUT THORN SHE PROTESTED SOLEMNLY TO ME THAT IT WAS NOT THORN WHO COMMITTED THE DEED THAT IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HE FOR THORN WAS WITH HER AT THE MOMENT OF ITS BEING DONE IT'S NOT TRUE
20-5360-0063 FIRED RICHARD IT WAS THORN RICHARD YOU CANNOT TELL
20-5360-0064 I KNOW THAT NO MAN COULD HAVE RUSHED OUT IN THAT FRANTIC MANNER WITH THOSE SIGNS OF GUILT AND FEAR ABOUT HIM UNLESS HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN A BAD DEED WAS RICHARD HARE'S ANSWER IT COULD HAVE BEEN NO ONE ELSE
20-5360-0065 AFY DECLARED HE WAS WITH HER REPEATED MISTER CARLYLE LOOK HERE SIR YOU ARE A SHARP MAN AND FOLKS SAY I AM NOT BUT I CAN SEE THINGS AND DRAW MY REASONING AS WELL AS THEY CAN PERHAPS
20-5360-0066 IF THORN WERE NOT HALLIJOHN'S MURDERER WHY SHOULD HE BE PERSECUTING ME WHAT WOULD HE CARE ABOUT ME AND WHY SHOULD HIS FACE TURN LIVID AS IT HAS DONE EACH TIME HE HAS SEEN MY EYES UPON HIM
20-5360-0067 WHETHER HE DID COMMIT THE MURDER OR WHETHER HE DIDN'T HE MUST KNOW THAT I DID NOT BECAUSE HE CAME UPON ME WAITING AS HE WAS TEARING FROM THE COTTAGE DICK'S REASONING WAS NOT BAD ANOTHER THING HE RESUMED
20-5360-0068 THAT SHE WAS ALONE AT THE BACK OF THE COTTAGE AND KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT TILL AFTERWARDS HOW COULD SHE HAVE SWORN SHE WAS ALONE IF THORN WAS WITH HER THE FACT HAD ENTIRELY ESCAPED MISTER CARLYLE'S MEMORY IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH AFY
20-5360-0069 OR HE WOULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO POINT OUT THE DISCREPANCY AND TO INQUIRE HOW SHE COULD RECONCILE IT YET HER ASSERTION TO HIM HAD BEEN MOST POSITIVE AND SOLEMN THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES IN THE MATTER WHICH HE COULD NOT RECONCILE
20-5360-0070 NOW THAT I HAVE GOT OVER MY PASSION FOR AFY I CAN SEE HER FAULTS MISTER CARLYLE SHE'D NO MORE TELL AN UNTRUTH THAN I SHOULD STICK A MOST AWFUL THUNDERING AT THE ROOM DOOR
20-5360-0071 LOUD ENOUGH TO BRING THE VERY HOUSE DOWN NO OFFICERS OF JUSTICE SEARCHING FOR A FUGITIVE EVER MADE A LOUDER RICHARD HARE HIS FACE TURNED TO CHALK HIS EYES STARTING
20-5360-0072 AND HIS OWN LIGHT HAIR BRISTLING UP WITH HORROR STRUGGLED INTO HIS WET SMOCK FROCK AFTER A FASHION THE TAILS UP ABOUT HIS EARS AND THE SLEEVES HANGING FORCED ON HIS HAT AND HIS FALSE WHISKERS LOOKED ROUND IN A BEWILDERED MANNER
20-5360-0073 FOR SOME CUPBOARD OR MOUSE HOLE INTO WHICH HE MIGHT CREEP AND SEEING NONE RUSHED TO THE FIREPLACE AND PLACED HIS FOOT ON THE FENDER THAT HE PURPOSED AN ATTEMPT AT CHIMNEY CLIMBING WAS EVIDENT THOUGH HOW THE FIRE WOULD HAVE AGREED WITH HIS PANTALOONS
20-5360-0074 NOT TO SPEAK OF WHAT THEY CONTAINED POOR DICK APPEARED COMPLETELY TO IGNORE MISTER CARLYLE DREW HIM BACK KEEPING HIS CALM POWERFUL HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER WHILE CERTAIN SOUNDS IN AN ANGRY VOICE WERE JERKED THROUGH THE KEYHOLE
20-5360-0075 RICHARD BE A MAN PUT ASIDE THIS WEAKNESS THIS FEAR HAVE I NOT TOLD YOU THAT HARM SHALL NOT COME NEAR YOU IN MY HOUSE IT MAY BE THAT OFFICER FROM LONDON
20-5360-0076 HE MAY HAVE BROUGHT HALF A DOZEN MORE WITH HIM GASPED THE UNHAPPY RICHARD I SAID THEY MIGHT HAVE DODGED ME ALL THE WAY HERE NONSENSE SIT YOU DOWN AND BE AT REST IT IS ONLY CORNELIA
20-5360-0077 AND SHE WILL BE AS ANXIOUS TO SHIELD YOU FROM DANGER AS I CAN BE IS IT CRIED THE RELIEVED RICHARD CAN'T YOU MAKE HER KEEP OUT HE CONTINUED HIS TEETH STILL CHATTERING
20-5360-0078 NO THAT I CAN'T IF SHE HAS A MIND TO COME IN WAS THE CANDID ANSWER YOU REMEMBER WHAT SHE WAS RICHARD SHE IS NOT ALTERED KNOWING THAT TO SPEAK ON THIS SIDE THE DOOR TO HIS SISTER
20-5360-0079 WHEN SHE WAS IN ONE OF HER RESOLUTE MOODS WOULD BE OF NO USE MISTER CARLYLE OPENED THE DOOR DEXTEROUSLY SWUNG HIMSELF THROUGH IT AND SHUT IT AFTER HIM
