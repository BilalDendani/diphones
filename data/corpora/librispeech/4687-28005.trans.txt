4687-28005-0000 A TIPSY PARSON IN A VILLAGE NOT A HUNDRED MILES FROM PHILADELPHIA
4687-28005-0001 WHO HAD THE PASTORAL CHARGE OF A VERY RESPECTABLE CONGREGATION AND WAS HIGHLY ESTEEMED BY THEM BUT THERE WAS ONE THING IN WHICH HE DID NOT GIVE GENERAL SATISFACTION AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH MANY EXCELLENT MEMBERS OF HIS CHURCH FELT SERIOUSLY SCANDALIZED
4687-28005-0002 HE WOULD NEITHER JOIN A TEMPERANCE SOCIETY
4687-28005-0003 IS ONLY FAIR TO SAY HOWEVER THAT SUCH SPIRITUOUS INDULGENCES WERE NOT OF FREQUENT OCCURRENCE IT WAS MORE THE PRINCIPLE OF THE THING AS HE SAID THAT HE STOOD UPON THAN ANY THING ELSE THAT PREVENTED HIS SIGNING A TEMPERANCE PLEDGE
4687-28005-0004 SUNDRY WERE THE ATTACKS BOTH OPEN AND SECRET TO WHICH THE REVEREND MISTER MANLIUS WAS SUBJECTED AND MANY WERE THE DISCUSSIONS INTO WHICH HE WAS DRAWN BY THE ADVOCATES OF TOTAL ABSTINENCE HIS MODE OF ARGUMENT WAS VERY SUMMARY
4687-28005-0005 I WOULD NO MORE SIGN A PLEDGE NOT TO DRINK BRANDY THAN I WOULD SIGN A PLEDGE NOT TO STEAL WAS THE POSITION HE TOOK I WISH TO BE FREE TO CHOOSE GOOD OR EVIL AND TO ACT RIGHT BECAUSE IT IS WRONG TO DO OTHERWISE
4687-28005-0006 I DO NOT FIND FAULT WITH OTHERS FOR SIGNING A PLEDGE NOR FOR ABSTAINING FROM WINE IF THEY THINK IT RIGHT IT IS RIGHT FOR THEM BUT AS FOR MYSELF
4687-28005-0007 MY BONDS ARE INTERNAL PRINCIPLES I AM TEMPERATE BECAUSE INTEMPERANCE IS SIN FOR MEN WHO HAVE ABUSED THEIR FREEDOM AND SO FAR LOST ALL RATIONAL CONTROL OVER THEMSELVES THAT THEY CANNOT RESIST THE INSANE SPIRIT OF INTEMPERANCE
4687-28005-0008 THE PLEDGE IS ALL IMPORTANT SIGN IT I SAY IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN BUT DO NOT SIGN IT BECAUSE THIS THAT OR THE OTHER TEMPERATE MAN HAS SIGNED IT BUT BECAUSE YOU FEEL IT TO BE YOUR ONLY HOPE DO IT FOR YOURSELF
4687-28005-0009 AND DO IT IF YOU ARE THE ONLY MAN IN THE WORLD WHO ACTS THUS TO SIGN BECAUSE ANOTHER MAN WHOM YOU THINK MORE RESPECTABLE HAS SIGNED WILL GIVE YOU LITTLE OR NO STRENGTH YOU MUST DO IT FOR YOURSELF AND BECAUSE IT IS RIGHT
4687-28005-0010 THE PARSON WAS PRETTY READY WITH THE TONGUE AND RARELY CAME OFF SECOND BEST WHEN HIS OPPONENTS DRAGGED HIM INTO A CONTROVERSY ALTHOUGH HIS ARGUMENTS WERE CALLED BY THEM WHEN HE WAS NOT PRESENT MERE FUSTIAN
4687-28005-0011 HIS LOVE FOR WINE AND BRANDY IS AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL THIS HOSTILITY TO THE TEMPERANCE CAUSE WAS BOLDLY SAID OF HIM BY INDIVIDUALS IN AND OUT OF HIS CHURCH BUT ESPECIALLY WERE THE MEMBERS OF OTHER CHURCHES SEVERE UPON HIM HE'LL TURN OUT A DRUNKARD SAID ONE
4687-28005-0012 HE DOES MORE HARM TO THE TEMPERANCE CAUSE THAN TEN DRUNKARDS ALLEGED A THIRD WHILE OTHERS SAID ISN'T IT SCANDALOUS HE'S A DISGRACE TO HIS PROFESSION HE PRETEND TO HAVE RELIGION A MINISTER INDEED AND SO THE CHANGES RANG
4687-28005-0013 ALL THIS TIME MISTER MANLIUS FIRMLY MAINTAINED HIS GROUND TAKING HIS GLASS OF WINE WHENEVER IT SUITED HIM AT LAST
4687-28005-0014 AND AT WHICH WINE WAS CIRCULATED FREELY A RATHER SCANDALOUS REPORT GOT ABROAD AND SOON WENT BUZZING ALL OVER THE VILLAGE A YOUNG MAN WHO MADE NO SECRET OF BEING FOND OF HIS GLASS AND WHO WAS AT THE DINNER PARTY MET ON THE DAY AFTER
4687-28005-0015 A VERY WARM ADVOCATE OF TEMPERANCE AND A MEMBER OF A DIFFERENT DENOMINATION FROM THAT IN WHICH MISTER MANLIUS WAS A MINISTER AND SAID TO HIM WITH MOCK GRAVITY WE HAD A RARA AVIS AT OUR DINNER PARTY YESTERDAY PERKINS INDEED WHAT WONDERFUL THING WAS THAT
4687-28005-0016 A TIPSY PARSON A WHAT THE MAN'S EYES BECAME INSTANTLY ALMOST AS BIG AS SAUCERS A TIPSY PARSON WHO MISTER MANLIUS WAS EAGERLY INQUIRED I DIDN'T SAY SO I CALL NO NAMES
4687-28005-0017 HE WAS PRESENT I KNOW AND DRANK WINE I AM TOLD LIKE A FISH I WASN'T AWARE BEFORE THAT FISHES DRANK WINE SAID THE MAN GRAVELY IT WAS MANLIUS WASN'T IT URGED THE OTHER I CALL NO NAMES WAS REPEATED
4687-28005-0018 ALL I SAID WAS THAT WE HAD A TIPSY PARSON AND SO WE HAD I'LL PROVE IT BEFORE A JURY OF A THOUSAND IF NECESSARY IT'S NO MORE THAN I EXPECTED SAID THE TEMPERANCE MAN
4687-28005-0019 HE PRETEND TO PREACH THE GOSPEL I WONDER HE ISN'T STRUCK DEAD IN THE PULPIT THE MOMENT HIS INFORMANT HAD LEFT HIM
4687-28005-0020 AT MISTER REESIDE'S DINNER PARTY FROM LIP TO LIP THE SCANDAL FLEW WITH LITTLE LESS THAN ELECTRIC QUICKNESS IT WAS ALL OVER THE VILLAGE BY THE NEXT DAY SOME DOUBTED SOME DENIED BUT THE MAJORITY BELIEVED THE STORY IT WAS SO LIKELY TO BE TRUE
4687-28005-0021 AND CITE THE MINISTER TO APPEAR AND ANSWER FOR HIMSELF ON THE SCANDALOUS CHARGE OF DRUNKENNESS THERE WAS AN UNUSUAL NUMBER OF VACANT PEWS DURING SERVICE BOTH MORNING AND AFTERNOON MONDAY CAME
4687-28005-0022 AND EARLY IN THE DAY A COMMITTEE OF TWO DEACONS WAITED UPON MISTER MANLIUS AND INFORMED HIM OF THE REPORT IN CIRCULATION AND OF THEIR WISH THAT HE WOULD APPEAR BEFORE THEM ON THE NEXT AFTERNOON TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF
4687-28005-0023 AS THE CHURCH DEEMED THE MATTER FAR TOO SERIOUS TO BE PASSED LIGHTLY OVER THE MINISTER WAS EVIDENTLY A GOOD DEAL SURPRISED AND STARTLED AT THIS BUT HE NEITHER DENIED THE CHARGE NOR ATTEMPTED ANY PALLIATION MERELY SAYING THAT HE WOULD ATTEND OF COURSE
4687-28005-0024 AS THEY WALKED WITH SOBER FACES AWAY FROM THE MINISTER'S DWELLING PLAIN YES IT'S WRITTEN IN HIS FACE RETURNED DEACON TODD SO MUCH FOR OPPOSING TEMPERANCE REFORMS AND DRINKING WINE IT'S A JUDGMENT UPON HIM BUT WHAT A SCANDAL TO OUR CHURCH SAID DEACON JONES
4687-28005-0025 YES THINK OF THAT HE MUST BE SUSPENDED AND NOT RESTORED UNTIL HE SIGNS THE PLEDGE I DON'T BELIEVE HE'LL EVER DO THAT WHY NOT HE SAYS HE WOULD CUT OFF HIS RIGHT HAND FIRST PEOPLE ARE VERY FOND OF CUTTING OFF THEIR RIGHT HAND YOU KNOW
4687-28005-0026 MY WORD FOR IT THIS WILL DO THE BUSINESS FOR HIM
4687-28005-0027 I SHALL GO FOR SUSPENDING HIM UNTIL HE SIGNS THE PLEDGE I DON'T KNOW BUT THAT I WILL GO WITH YOU IF HE SIGNS THE PLEDGE HE'S SAFE AND SO THE TWO DEACONS SETTLED THE MATTER ON THE NEXT DAY IN GRAVE COUNCIL ASSEMBLED WERE ALL THE DEACONS OF THE CHURCH
4687-28005-0028 BESIDES SUNDRY INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD COME AS THE MINISTER'S FRIENDS OR ACCUSERS PERKINS WHO HAD PUT THE REPORT IN CIRCULATION WAS THERE AT THE SPECIAL REQUEST OF ONE OF THE DEACONS WHO HAD ASCERTAINED THAT HE HAD AS MUCH OR A LITTLE MORE TO SAY IN THE MATTER THAN ANY ONE
4687-28005-0029 PERKINS WAS CALLED UPON RATHER UNEXPECTEDLY TO ANSWER ONE OR TWO QUESTIONS IMMEDIATELY ON THE OPENING OF THE MEETING BUT AS HE WAS A STANCH TEMPERANCE MAN AND CORDIALLY DESPISED THE MINISTER HE WAS BOLD TO REPLY
4687-28005-0030 MISTER PERKINS SAID THE PRESIDING DEACON AS FAR AS WE CAN LEARN THIS SCANDALOUS CHARGE ORIGINATED WITH YOU I WILL THEREFORE ASK YOU
4687-28005-0031 I DID WAS THE UNHESITATING ANSWER WERE YOU PRESENT AT MISTER REESIDE'S NO SIR DID YOU SEE MISTER MANLIUS COMING FROM THE HOUSE INTOXICATED NO WHAT EVIDENCE THEN HAVE YOU OF THE TRUTH OF YOUR CHARGE
4687-28005-0032 WE HAVE CONVERSED THIS MORNING WITH SEVERAL WHO WERE PRESENT AND ALL SAY THAT THEY OBSERVED NOTHING OUT OF THE WAY IN MISTER MANLIUS ON THE OCCASION OF WHICH YOU SPEAK THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER AND WE SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOUR AUTHORITY FOR A STATEMENT
4687-28005-0033 SO INJURIOUS TO THE REPUTATION OF THE MINISTER AND THE CAUSE OF RELIGION MY AUTHORITY IS MISTER BURTON WHO WAS PRESENT DID HE TELL YOU THAT MISTER MANLIUS WAS INTOXICATED
4687-28005-0034 HE SAID THERE WAS A DRUNKEN MINISTER THERE AND MISTER MANLIUS I HAVE ASCERTAINED WAS THE ONLY CLERGYMAN PRESENT WAS THAT SO ASKED THE DEACON OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS AT MISTER REESIDE'S MISTER MANLIUS WAS THE ONLY CLERGYMAN THERE WAS REPLIED
4687-28005-0035 THEN SAID PERKINS IF THERE WAS A DRUNKEN MINISTER THERE IT MUST HAVE BEEN MISTER MANLIUS I CAN DRAW NO OTHER INFERENCE CAN MISTER BURTON BE FOUND WAS NOW ASKED AN INDIVIDUAL IMMEDIATELY VOLUNTEERED TO GO IN SEARCH OF HIM
4687-28005-0036 IN HALF AN HOUR HE WAS PRODUCED AS HE ENTERED THE GRAVE ASSEMBLY HE LOOKED AROUND WITH GREAT COMPOSURE UPON THE ARRAY OF SOLEMN FACES AND EYES INTENTLY FIXED UPON HIM HE DID NOT APPEAR IN THE LEAST ABASHED
4687-28005-0037 YOU WERE AT MISTER REESIDE'S LAST WEEK AT A DINNER PARTY I BELIEVE SAID THE PRESIDING DEACON I WAS DID YOU SEE MISTER MANLIUS INTOXICATED ON THAT OCCASION MISTER MANLIUS GOOD HEAVENS NO
4687-28005-0038 I CAN TESTIFY UPON OATH THAT HE WAS AS SOLEMN AS A JUDGE WHO SAYS THAT I MADE SO SCANDALOUS AN ALLEGATION BURTON APPEARED TO GROW STRONGLY EXCITED I SAY SO CRIED PERKINS IN A LOUD VOICE YOU SAY SO
4687-28005-0039 AND PRAY UPON WHAT AUTHORITY UPON THE AUTHORITY OF YOUR OWN WORDS NEVER BUT YOU DID TELL ME SO PERKINS WAS MUCH EXCITED WHEN ON THE DAY AFTER THE DINNER PARTY DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
4687-28005-0040 OH YES PERFECTLY THAT YOU HAD A DRUNKEN MINISTER AT DINNER NO I NEVER SAID THAT BUT YOU DID I CAN BE QUALIFIED TO IT I SAID WE HAD A TIPSY PARSON AND PRAY
4687-28005-0041 WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE AT THE WORDS TIPSY PARSON THE MINISTER BURST INTO A LOUD LAUGH AND SO DID TWO OR THREE OTHERS WHO HAD BEEN AT MISTER REESIDE'S THE GRAVE DEACON IN THE CHAIR LOOKED AROUND WITH FROWNING WONDER AT SUCH INDECORUM
4687-28005-0042 AND FELT THAT ESPECIALLY ILL TIMED WAS THE LEVITY OF THE MINISTER I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS HE SAID WITH GREAT GRAVITY I CAN EXPLAIN IT REMARKED AN INDIVIDUAL RISING
4687-28005-0043 THE TIPSY PARSON THE COOK OF OUR KIND HOSTESS IN HER CULINARY INGENUITY FURNISHED A DESSERT WHICH SHE CALLED TIPSY PARSON MADE I BELIEVE BY SOAKING SPONGE CAKE IN BRANDY AND POURING A CUSTARD OVER IT IT IS THEREFORE TRUE
4687-28005-0044 AS OUR FRIEND BURTON HAS SAID THAT THERE WAS A TIPSY PARSON AT THE TABLE BUT AS TO THE DRUNKEN MINISTER OF MISTER PERKINS I KNOW NOTHING NEVER BEFORE IN A GRAVE AND SOLEMN ASSEMBLY OF DEACONS WAS THERE SUCH A SUDDEN AND UNIVERSAL BURST OF LAUGHTER
4687-28005-0045 SUCH A HOLDING OF SIDES AND VIBRATION OF BODIES AS FOLLOWED THIS UNEXPECTED SPEECH IN THE MIDST OF THE CONFUSION AND NOISE PERKINS QUIETLY RETIRED HE HAS BEEN KNOWN EVER SINCE IN THE VILLAGE MUCH TO HIS CHAGRIN AND SCANDALIZATION
4687-28005-0046 HE BEING STILL A WARM TEMPERANCE MAN AS THE TIPSY PARSON
4687-28005-0047 AND HE IS NOW SERIOUSLY INCLINED TO LEAVE THE VILLAGE IN ORDER TO ESCAPE THE RIDICULE HIS OVER ZEALOUS EFFORT TO BLAST THE MINISTER'S REPUTATION HAS CALLED INTO EXISTENCE
