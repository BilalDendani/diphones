4991-6181-0000 SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE BED AND TAKING ROSAMOND IN HER ARMS SAT DOWN WITH HER BY THE FIRE MY POOR CHILD SHE SAID TWO TERRIBLE FAILURES AND THE MORE THE HARDER

4991-6181-0003 THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET RID OF YOUR WEARY SHADOWY SELF AND FIND YOUR STRONG TRUE SELF COME MY CHILD I WILL HELP YOU ALL I CAN FOR NOW I CAN HELP YOU
4991-6181-0004 YET AGAIN SHE LED HER TO THE SAME DOOR AND SEEMED TO THE PRINCESS TO SEND HER YET AGAIN ALONE INTO THE ROOM SHE WAS IN A FOREST A PLACE HALF WILD HALF TENDED
4991-6181-0005 THE TREES WERE GRAND AND FULL OF THE LOVELIEST BIRDS OF ALL GLOWING GLEAMING AND RADIANT COLORS WHICH UNLIKE THE BRILLIANT BIRDS WE KNOW IN OUR WORLD SANG DELICIOUSLY
4991-6181-0006 EVERY ONE ACCORDING TO HIS COLOR THE TREES WERE NOT AT ALL CROWDED BUT THEIR LEAVES WERE SO THICK AND THEIR BOUGHS SPREAD SO FAR THAT IT WAS ONLY HERE AND THERE A SUNBEAM COULD GET STRAIGHT THROUGH
4991-6181-0007 ALL THE GENTLE CREATURES OF A FOREST WERE THERE BUT NO CREATURES THAT KILLED NOT EVEN A WEASEL TO KILL THE RABBITS OR A BEETLE TO EAT THE SNAILS OUT OF THEIR STRIPED SHELLS AS TO THE BUTTERFLIES
4991-6181-0008 WORDS WOULD BUT WRONG THEM IF THEY TRIED TO TELL HOW GORGEOUS THEY WERE THE PRINCESS'S DELIGHT WAS SO GREAT THAT SHE NEITHER LAUGHED NOR RAN
4991-6181-0009 THEY WERE NOWHERE NEITHER ON THE HIGH TREES NOR ON THE FEW SHRUBS THAT GREW HERE AND THERE AMONGST THEM WERE THERE ANY BLOSSOMS AND IN THE GRASS THAT GREW EVERYWHERE THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE FLOWER TO BE SEEN
4991-6181-0010 AH WELL SAID ROSAMOND AGAIN TO HERSELF WHERE ALL THE BIRDS AND BUTTERFLIES ARE LIVING FLOWERS WE CAN DO WITHOUT THE OTHER SORT
4991-6181-0011 AND THERE ON THE ROOT OF A GREAT OAK SAT THE LOVELIEST
4991-6181-0012 WITH HER LAP FULL OF FLOWERS OF ALL COLORS BUT OF SUCH KINDS AS ROSAMOND HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SHE WAS PLAYING WITH THEM BURYING HER HANDS IN THEM TUMBLING THEM ABOUT AND EVERY NOW AND THEN PICKING ONE FROM THE REST AND THROWING IT AWAY
4991-6181-0013 ALL THE TIME SHE NEVER SMILED EXCEPT WITH HER EYES WHICH WERE AS FULL AS THEY COULD HOLD OF THE LAUGHTER OF THE SPIRIT A LAUGHTER WHICH IN THIS WORLD IS NEVER HEARD ONLY SETS
4991-6181-0014 THE EYES ALIGHT WITH A LIQUID SHINING ROSAMOND DREW NEARER FOR THE WONDERFUL CREATURE WOULD HAVE DRAWN A TIGER TO HER SIDE AND TAMED HIM ON THE WAY A FEW YARDS FROM HER
4991-6181-0015 AS WELL SHE MIGHT WHERE NONE GREW SAVE IN HER OWN LONGING BUT TO HER AMAZEMENT SHE FOUND INSTEAD OF A FLOWER THROWN AWAY TO WITHER ONE FAST ROOTED AND QUITE AT HOME SHE LEFT IT AND WENT TO ANOTHER
4991-6181-0016 BUT IT ALSO WAS FAST IN THE SOIL AND GROWING COMFORTABLY IN THE WARM GRASS WHAT COULD IT MEAN ONE AFTER ANOTHER SHE TRIED UNTIL AT LENGTH SHE WAS SATISFIED
4991-6181-0017 SHE WATCHED THEN UNTIL SHE SAW HER THROW ONE AND INSTANTLY BOUNDED TO THE SPOT BUT THE FLOWER HAD BEEN QUICKER THAN SHE THERE IT GREW FAST FIXED IN THE EARTH AND SHE THOUGHT
4991-6181-0018 LOOKED AT HER ROGUISHLY SOMETHING EVIL MOVED IN HER AND SHE PLUCKED IT DON'T DON'T CRIED THE CHILD MY FLOWERS CANNOT LIVE IN YOUR HANDS ROSAMOND LOOKED AT THE FLOWER
4991-6181-0019 IT WAS WITHERED ALREADY SHE THREW IT FROM HER OFFENDED THE CHILD ROSE WITH DIFFICULTY KEEPING HER LAPFUL TOGETHER PICKED IT UP
4991-6181-0020 SPOKE TO IT KISSED IT SANG TO IT OH SUCH A SWEET CHILDISH LITTLE SONG THE PRINCESS NEVER COULD RECALL A WORD OF IT AND THREW IT AWAY
4991-6181-0021 ROSAMOND'S BAD TEMPER SOON GAVE WAY THE BEAUTY AND SWEETNESS OF THE CHILD HAD OVERCOME IT AND ANXIOUS TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH HER SHE DREW NEAR AND SAID
4991-6181-0022 WON'T YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE FLOWER PLEASE YOU BEAUTIFUL CHILD THERE THEY ARE THEY ARE ALL FOR YOU ANSWERED THE CHILD POINTING WITH HER OUTSTRETCHED ARM AND FOREFINGER ALL ROUND
4991-6181-0023 BUT YOU TOLD ME A MINUTE AGO NOT TO TOUCH THEM YES INDEED I DID THEY CAN'T BE MINE IF I'M NOT TO TOUCH THEM IF TO CALL THEM YOURS YOU MUST KILL THEM THEN THEY ARE NOT YOURS AND NEVER NEVER CAN BE YOURS
4991-6181-0024 THEY ARE NOBODY'S WHEN THEY ARE DEAD BUT YOU DON'T KILL THEM I DON'T PULL THEM I THROW THEM AWAY I LIVE THEM HOW IS IT THAT YOU MAKE THEM GROW
4991-6181-0025 AND THROW IT AWAY AND THERE IT IS WHERE DO YOU GET THEM IN MY LAP I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME THROW ONE AWAY
4991-6181-0026 NO I HAVE NONE THEN YOU CAN'T THROW ONE AWAY IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT ONE
4991-6181-0027 I AM NOT MOCKING YOU SAID THE CHILD LOOKING HER FULL IN THE FACE WITH REPROACH IN HER LARGE BLUE EYES OH
4991-6181-0028 THAT'S WHERE THE FLOWERS COME FROM SAID THE PRINCESS TO HERSELF THE MOMENT SHE SAW THEM HARDLY KNOWING WHAT SHE MEANT
4991-6181-0029 THREW AWAY ALL THE FLOWERS SHE HAD IN HER LAP BUT ONE BY ONE AND WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF ANGER WHEN THEY WERE ALL GONE SHE STOOD A MOMENT AND THEN IN A KIND OF CHANTING CRY CALLED TWO OR THREE TIMES
4991-6181-0030 CAME GENTLY TROTTING THE LOVELIEST LITTLE SNOW WHITE PONY WITH GREAT SHINING BLUE WINGS HALF LIFTED FROM HIS SHOULDERS STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE LITTLE GIRL NEITHER HURRYING NOR LINGERING
4991-6181-0031 HE TROTTED WITH LIGHT ELASTIC TREAD ROSAMOND'S LOVE FOR ANIMALS BROKE INTO A PERFECT PASSION OF DELIGHT AT THE VISION
4991-6181-0032 SHE RUSHED TO MEET THE PONY WITH SUCH HASTE THAT ALTHOUGH CLEARLY THE BEST TRAINED ANIMAL UNDER THE SUN
4991-6181-0033 IT WAS THAT HAD SO STARTLED HIM WHEN HE PERCEIVED IT WAS A LITTLE GIRL HE DROPPED INSTANTLY UPON ALL FOURS AND CONTENT WITH AVOIDING HER
4991-6181-0034 ROSAMOND STOOD GAZING AFTER HIM IN MISERABLE DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN HE REACHED THE CHILD HE LAID HIS HEAD ON HER SHOULDER
4991-6181-0035 AND AFTER SHE HAD TALKED TO HIM A LITTLE HE TURNED AND CAME TROTTING BACK TO THE PRINCESS ALMOST BESIDE HERSELF WITH JOY
4991-6181-0036 NOT WITHSTANDING HER LOVE FOR THEM SHE WAS IN THE HABIT OF USING WITH ANIMALS AND SHE WAS NOT GENTLE ENOUGH IN HERSELF EVEN TO SEE THAT HE DID NOT LIKE IT
4991-6181-0037 AND WAS ONLY PUTTING UP WITH IT FOR THE SAKE OF HIS MISTRESS BUT
4991-6181-0038 WHICH THREW HER FLAT ON THE GRASS AND TROTTING BACK TO HIS MISTRESS BENT DOWN HIS HEAD BEFORE HER AS IF ASKING EXCUSE FOR RIDDING HIMSELF OF THE UNBEARABLE THE PRINCESS
4991-6181-0039 WAS FURIOUS SHE HAD FORGOTTEN ALL HER PAST LIFE UP TO THE TIME WHEN SHE FIRST SAW THE CHILD HER BEAUTY HAD MADE HER FORGET AND YET SHE WAS NOW ON THE VERY BORDERS OF HATING HER
4991-6181-0040 WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE OR RATHER TRIED TO DO HAD NOT PEGGY'S TAIL STRUCK HER DOWN WITH SUCH FORCE THAT FOR A MOMENT SHE COULD NOT RISE I CANNOT TELL BUT
4991-6181-0041 WHILE SHE LAY HALF STUNNED HER EYES FELL ON A LITTLE FLOWER JUST UNDER THEM IT STARED UP IN HER FACE LIKE THE LIVING THING IT WAS AND SHE COULD NOT TAKE HER EYES OFF ITS FACE
4991-6181-0042 IT WAS LIKE A PRIMROSE TRYING TO EXPRESS DOUBT INSTEAD OF CONFIDENCE IT SEEMED TO PUT HER HALF IN MIND OF SOMETHING AND SHE FELT AS IF SHAME WERE COMING
4991-6181-0043 BUT THE MOMENT HER FINGERS TOUCHED IT THE FLOWER WITHERED UP AND HUNG AS DEAD ON ITS STALKS AS IF A FLAME OF FIRE HAD PASSED OVER IT THEN A SHUDDER THRILLED THROUGH THE HEART OF THE PRINCESS AND SHE THOUGHT WITH HERSELF SAYING
4991-6181-0044 THE FLOWERS WITHER WHEN I TOUCH THEM AND THE PONIES DESPISE ME WITH THEIR TAILS WHAT A WRETCHED COARSE ILL BRED CREATURE I MUST BE
4991-6181-0045 THERE IS THAT LOVELY CHILD GIVING LIFE INSTEAD OF DEATH TO THE FLOWERS AND A MOMENT AGO I WAS HATING HER I AM MADE HORRID AND I SHALL BE HORRID AND I HATE MYSELF AND YET
4991-6181-0046 SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF GALLOPING FEET AND THERE WAS THE PONY WITH THE CHILD SEATED BETWIXT HIS WINGS COMING STRAIGHT ON AT FULL SPEED FOR WHERE SHE LAY I DON'T CARE SHE SAID
4991-6181-0047 THEY MAY TRAMPLE ME UNDER THEIR FEET IF THEY LIKE I AM TIRED AND SICK OF MYSELF A CREATURE AT WHOSE TOUCH THE FLOWERS WITHER
4991-6181-0048 BUT WHILE YET SOME DISTANCE OFF HE GAVE A GREAT BOUND
4991-6181-0049 ROSE YARDS AND YARDS ABOVE HER IN THE AIR AND ALIGHTED AS GENTLY AS A BIRD JUST A FEW FEET ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HER THE CHILD SLIPPED DOWN AND CAME AND KNEELED OVER HER
4991-6181-0050 DID MY PONY HURT YOU SHE SAID I AM SO SORRY YES HE HURT ME ANSWERED THE PRINCESS BUT NOT MORE THAN I DESERVED
4991-6181-0051 FOR I TOOK LIBERTIES WITH HIM AND HE DID NOT LIKE IT OH YOU DEAR SAID THE LITTLE GIRL

4991-6181-0056 WHAT MIND IT CRIED ROSAMOND ALMOST INDIGNANTLY THEN REMEMBERING CERTAIN THOUGHTS THAT HAD BUT A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE PASSED THROUGH HER MIND SHE LOOKED ON THE GROUND AND WAS SILENT
4991-6181-0057 YOU DON'T MIND IT THEN REPEATED THE CHILD I AM VERY GLAD THERE IS SUCH A YOU AND SUCH A PONY AND THAT SUCH A YOU HAS GOT SUCH A PONY SAID ROSAMOND
4991-6181-0058 STILL LOOKING ON THE GROUND BUT I DO WISH THE FLOWERS WOULD NOT DIE WHEN I TOUCH THEM I WAS CROSS TO SEE YOU MAKE THEM GROW BUT NOW I SHOULD BE CONTENT IF ONLY I DID NOT MAKE THEM WITHER
4991-6181-0059 AS SHE SPOKE SHE STROKED THE LITTLE GIRL'S BARE FEET WHICH WERE BY HER HALF BURIED IN THE SOFT MOSS AND AS SHE ENDED SHE LAID HER CHEEK ON THEM AND KISSED THEM
4991-6181-0060 DEAR PRINCESS SAID THE LITTLE GIRL THE FLOWERS WILL NOT ALWAYS WITHER AT YOUR TOUCH TRY NOW ONLY DO NOT PLUCK IT FLOWERS OUGHT NEVER TO BE PLUCKED EXCEPT TO GIVE AWAY
4991-6181-0061 TOUCH IT GENTLY A SILVERY FLOWER SOMETHING LIKE A SNOW DROP GREW JUST WITHIN HER REACH TIMIDLY

4991-6181-0063 AND CHANGED AND DEEPENED IN COLOR TILL IT WAS A RED GLOWING GOLD ROSAMOND GAZED MOTIONLESS WHEN THE TRANSFIGURATION OF THE FLOWER WAS PERFECTED SHE SPRANG TO HER FEET WITH CLASPED HANDS
4991-6181-0064 GAZING AT THE CHILD DID YOU NEVER SEE ME BEFORE ROSAMOND SHE ASKED NO NEVER ANSWERED THE PRINCESS I NEVER SAW ANY THING HALF SO LOVELY LOOK AT ME
4991-6181-0065 SAID THE CHILD AND AS ROSAMOND LOOKED THE CHILD BEGAN LIKE THE FLOWER TO GROW LARGER QUICKLY THROUGH EVERY GRADATION OF GROWTH SHE PASSED
4991-6181-0066 UNTIL SHE STOOD BEFORE HER A WOMAN PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL NEITHER OLD NOR YOUNG FOR HERS WAS THE OLD AGE OF EVERLASTING YOUTH ROSAMOND WAS UTTERLY ENCHANTED AND STOOD GAZING WITHOUT WORD OR MOVEMENT
4991-6181-0067 UNTIL SHE COULD ENDURE NO MORE DELIGHT THEN HER MIND COLLAPSED TO THE THOUGHT HAD THE PONY GROWN TOO SHE GLANCED ROUND THERE WAS NO PONY NO GRASS
4991-6181-0068 NO FLOWERS NO BRIGHT BIRDED FOREST BUT THE COTTAGE OF THE WISE WOMAN AND BEFORE HER ON THE HEARTH OF IT THE GODDESS CHILD THE ONLY THING UNCHANGED
