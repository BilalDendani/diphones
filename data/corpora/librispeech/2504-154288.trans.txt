2504-154288-0000 THE WORD PAMPA OF ARAUCANIAN ORIGIN SIGNIFIES GRASS PLAIN
2504-154288-0001 THE MIMOSAS GROWING ON THE WESTERN PART
2504-154288-0002 GIVE THOSE PLAINS A PECULIAR APPEARANCE THE SOIL IS COMPOSED OF SAND AND RED OR YELLOW CLAY AND THIS IS COVERED BY A LAYER OF EARTH IN WHICH THE VEGETATION TAKES ROOT THE GEOLOGIST WOULD FIND RICH TREASURES IN THE TERTIARY STRATA HERE
2504-154288-0003 FOR IT IS FULL OF ANTEDILUVIAN REMAINS ENORMOUS BONES WHICH THE INDIANS ATTRIBUTE TO SOME GIGANTIC RACE THAT LIVED IN A PAST AGE
2504-154288-0004 SO HIGH AND THICK THAT THE INDIANS FIND SHELTER IN IT FROM STORMS AT CERTAIN DISTANCES BUT INCREASINGLY SELDOM THERE WERE WET MARSHY SPOTS ALMOST ENTIRELY UNDER WATER
2504-154288-0005 HERE THE HORSES DRANK THEIR FILL GREEDILY AS IF BENT ON QUENCHING THEIR THIRST FOR PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE THALCAVE WENT FIRST TO BEAT THE BUSHES AND FRIGHTEN AWAY THE CHOLINAS A MOST DANGEROUS SPECIES OF VIPER
2504-154288-0006 FOR TWO DAYS THEY PLODDED STEADILY ACROSS THIS ARID AND DESERTED PLAIN THE DRY HEAT BECAME SEVERE THERE WERE NOT ONLY NO RIOS BUT EVEN THE PONDS DUG OUT BY THE INDIANS WERE DRIED UP AS THE DROUGHT SEEMED TO INCREASE WITH EVERY MILE
2504-154288-0007 AT LAKE SALINAS REPLIED THE INDIAN AND WHEN SHALL WE GET THERE TO MORROW EVENING
2504-154288-0008 BUT THE TRAVELERS COULD NOT FALL BACK ON THIS RESOURCE NOT HAVING THE NECESSARY IMPLEMENTS
2504-154288-0009 THEIR PRESENCE INDICATED A CHANGE OF WIND WHICH SHIFTED TO THE NORTH A SOUTH OR SOUTHWEST WIND GENERALLY PUTS TO FLIGHT THESE LITTLE PESTS EVEN THESE PETTY ILLS OF LIFE COULD NOT RUFFLE THE MAJOR'S EQUANIMITY
2504-154288-0010 WAS PERFECTLY EXASPERATED BY SUCH TRIFLING ANNOYANCES HE ABUSED THE POOR MOSQUITOES DESPERATELY AND DEPLORED THE LACK OF SOME ACID LOTION WHICH WOULD HAVE EASED THE PAIN OF THEIR STINGS
2504-154288-0011 AMONG THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND NATURALISTS RECKON HE WOULD LISTEN TO NOTHING
2504-154288-0012 FOR THEY HAD TO GET TO LAKE SALINAS BEFORE SUNDOWN THE HORSES WERE TIRED OUT AND DYING FOR WATER AND THOUGH THEIR RIDERS HAD STINTED THEMSELVES FOR THEIR SAKES STILL THEIR RATION WAS VERY INSUFFICIENT THE DROUGHT WAS CONSTANTLY INCREASING AND THE HEAT NONE THE LESS FOR THE WIND BEING NORTH
2504-154288-0013 THIS WIND BEING THE SIMOOM OF THE PAMPAS THERE WAS A BRIEF INTERRUPTION THIS DAY TO THE MONOTONY OF THE JOURNEY MULRADY WHO WAS IN FRONT OF THE OTHERS RODE HASTILY BACK TO REPORT THE APPROACH OF A TROOP OF INDIANS
2504-154288-0014 THE NEWS WAS RECEIVED WITH VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS BY GLENARVAN AND THALCAVE THE SCOTCHMAN WAS GLAD OF THE CHANCE OF GLEANING SOME INFORMATION ABOUT HIS SHIPWRECKED COUNTRYMAN
2504-154288-0015 KNOWING THEIR BANDIT PROPENSITIES
2504-154288-0016 PRESENTLY THE NOMADS CAME IN SIGHT AND THE PATAGONIAN WAS REASSURED AT FINDING THEY WERE ONLY TEN IN NUMBER THEY CAME WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF THEM AND STOPPED THIS WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO OBSERVE THEM DISTINCTLY
2504-154288-0017 WITH ARCHED FOREHEAD AND OLIVE COMPLEXION THEY WERE DRESSED IN GUANACO SKINS AND CARRIED LANCES TWENTY FEET LONG
2504-154288-0018 SHOWED THEMSELVES TO BE ACCOMPLISHED RIDERS
2504-154288-0019 THE COWARDS EXCLAIMED PAGANEL THEY SCAMPERED OFF TOO QUICK FOR HONEST FOLKS SAID MC NABBS
2504-154288-0020 GAUCHOS THE GAUCHOS CRIED PAGANEL AND TURNING TO HIS COMPANIONS HE ADDED
2504-154288-0021 THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR HOW IS THAT ASKED MC NABBS BECAUSE THE GAUCHOS ARE INOFFENSIVE PEASANTS YOU BELIEVE THAT PAGANEL CERTAINLY I DO THEY TOOK US FOR ROBBERS AND FLED IN TERROR
2504-154288-0022 WHATEVER THEY WERE THAT'S MY OPINION TOO SAID THE MAJOR FOR IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN INSTEAD OF BEING HARMLESS
2504-154288-0023 THE IDEA EXCLAIMED PAGANEL AND FORTHWITH COMMENCED A LIVELY DISCUSSION OF THIS ETHNOLOGICAL THESIS SO LIVELY THAT THE MAJOR BECAME EXCITED
2504-154288-0024 I BELIEVE YOU ARE WRONG PAGANEL WRONG REPLIED PAGANEL YES THALCAVE TOOK THEM FOR ROBBERS AND HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT WELL THALCAVE WAS MISTAKEN THIS TIME RETORTED PAGANEL SOMEWHAT SHARPLY
2504-154288-0025 RETORTED MC NABBS QUITE AS OBSTINATE AS HIS OPPONENT SIR I THINK YOU ARE VERY ANNOYING TO DAY AND I THINK YOU ARE VERY CRABBED GLENARVAN THOUGHT IT WAS HIGH TIME TO INTERFERE
2504-154288-0026 COME NOW THERE IS NO DOUBT ONE OF YOU IS VERY TEASING AND THE OTHER IS VERY CRABBED AND I MUST SAY I AM SURPRISED AT BOTH OF YOU THE PATAGONIAN WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE CAUSE COULD SEE THAT THE TWO FRIENDS WERE QUARRELING
2504-154288-0027 IT'S THE NORTH WIND THE NORTH WIND
2504-154288-0028 IT'S THE NORTH WIND THAT HAS PUT YOU IN A BAD TEMPER I HAVE HEARD THAT IN SOUTH AMERICA THE WIND GREATLY IRRITATES THE NERVOUS SYSTEM BY SAINT PATRICK EDWARD YOU ARE RIGHT SAID THE MAJOR LAUGHING HEARTILY
2504-154288-0029 BUT PAGANEL IN A TOWERING RAGE WOULD NOT GIVE UP THE CONTEST AND TURNED UPON GLENARVAN WHOSE INTERVENTION IN THIS JESTING MANNER HE RESENTED AND SO MY LORD MY NERVOUS SYSTEM IS IRRITATED HE SAID
2504-154288-0030 AS THE TRAMONTANE DOES IN THE CAMPAGNA OF ROME CRIMES RETURNED THE GEOGRAPHER DO I LOOK LIKE A MAN THAT WOULD COMMIT CRIMES THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT I SAID TELL ME AT ONCE THAT I WANT TO ASSASSINATE YOU WELL I AM REALLY AFRAID REPLIED GLENARVAN
