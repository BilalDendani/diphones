4964-30587-0000 BUT MARIAN'S FATHER HAD DECREED THAT NO POSITIVE PLEDGE SHOULD PASS BETWEEN THEM UNTIL MARIAN WAS TWENTY ONE ESTERBROOK ACCEPTED HIS MAPPED OUT DESTINY AND SELECTED BRIDE WITH THE CONVICTION THAT HE WAS AN EXCEPTIONALLY LUCKY FELLOW
4964-30587-0001 OUT OF ALL THE WOMEN IN THE WORLD MARIAN WAS THE VERY ONE WHOM HE WOULD HAVE CHOSEN AS MISTRESS OF HIS FINE OLD HOME SHE HAD BEEN HIS BOYHOOD'S IDEAL HE BELIEVED THAT HE LOVED HER SINCERELY
4964-30587-0002 BUT HE WAS NOT TOO MUCH IN LOVE TO BE BLIND TO THE WORLDLY ADVANTAGES OF HIS MARRIAGE WITH HIS COUSIN HIS FATHER HAD DIED TWO YEARS PREVIOUSLY LEAVING HIM WEALTHY AND INDEPENDENT MARIAN HAD LOST HER MOTHER IN CHILDHOOD
4964-30587-0003 HER FATHER DIED WHEN SHE WAS EIGHTEEN SINCE THEN SHE HAD LIVED ALONE WITH HER AUNT HER LIFE WAS QUIET AND LONELY ESTERBROOK'S COMPANIONSHIP WAS ALL THAT BRIGHTENED IT BUT IT WAS ENOUGH MARIAN LAVISHED ON HIM ALL THE RICH WOMANLY LOVE OF HER HEART
4964-30587-0004 ON HER TWENTY FIRST BIRTHDAY THEY WERE FORMALLY BETROTHED THEY WERE TO BE MARRIED IN THE FOLLOWING AUTUMN NO SHADOW HAD DRIFTED ACROSS THE HEAVEN OF HER HAPPINESS SHE BELIEVED HERSELF SECURE IN HER LOVER'S UNFALTERING DEVOTION
4964-30587-0005 PASSING ACQUAINTANCES CALLED HER COLD AND PROUD ONLY THE PRIVILEGED FEW KNEW THE RICH DEPTHS OF WOMANLY TENDERNESS IN HER NATURE ESTERBROOK THOUGHT THAT HE FULLY APPRECIATED HER
4964-30587-0006 AS HE HAD WALKED HOMEWARD THE NIGHT OF THEIR BETROTHAL HE HAD REVIEWED WITH UNCONSCIOUS CRITICISM HIS MENTAL CATALOGUE OF MARIAN'S GRACES AND GOOD QUALITIES ADMITTING WITH SUPREME SATISFACTION THAT THERE WAS NOT ONE THING ABOUT HER THAT HE COULD WISH CHANGED
4964-30587-0007 THERE WAS NO ONE TO CONSULT BUT THEMSELVES THEY WERE TO BE MARRIED EARLY IN SEPTEMBER AND THEN GO ABROAD ESTERBROOK MAPPED OUT THE DETAILS OF THEIR BRIDAL TOUR WITH CAREFUL THOUGHTFULNESS
4964-30587-0008 THEY WOULD VISIT ALL THE OLD WORLD PLACES THAT MARIAN WISHED TO SEE AFTERWARDS THEY WOULD COME BACK HOME
4964-30587-0009 HE DID MOST OF THE PLANNING MARIAN WAS CONTENT TO LISTEN IN HAPPY SILENCE AFTERWARDS SHE HAD PROPOSED THIS WALK TO THE COVE WHAT PARTICULAR OBJECT OF CHARITY HAVE YOU FOUND AT THE COVE NOW ASKED ESTERBROOK WITH LAZY INTEREST AS THEY WALKED ALONG
4964-30587-0010 MISSUS BARRETT'S LITTLE BESSIE IS VERY ILL WITH FEVER ANSWERED MARIAN THEN CATCHING HIS ANXIOUS LOOK SHE HASTENED TO ADD IT IS NOTHING INFECTIOUS SOME KIND OF A SLOW SAPPING VARIETY THERE IS NO DANGER ESTERBROOK I WAS NOT AFRAID FOR MYSELF HE REPLIED QUIETLY
4964-30587-0011 MY ALARM WAS FOR YOU YOU ARE TOO PRECIOUS TO ME MARIAN FOR ME TO PERMIT YOU TO RISK HEALTH AND LIFE IF IT WERE DANGEROUS WHAT A LADY BOUNTIFUL YOU ARE TO THOSE PEOPLE AT THE COVE WHEN WE ARE MARRIED YOU MUST TAKE ME IN HAND AND TEACH ME YOUR CREED OF CHARITY
4964-30587-0012 I'M AFRAID I'VE LIVED A RATHER SELFISH LIFE YOU WILL CHANGE ALL THAT DEAR YOU WILL MAKE A GOOD MAN OF ME YOU ARE THAT NOW ESTERBROOK SHE SAID SOFTLY IF YOU WERE NOT I COULD NOT LOVE YOU
4964-30587-0013 IT IS A NEGATIVE SORT OF GOODNESS I FEAR I HAVE NEVER BEEN TRIED OR TEMPTED SEVERELY PERHAPS I SHOULD FAIL UNDER THE TEST I AM SURE YOU WOULD NOT ANSWERED MARIAN PROUDLY ESTERBROOK LAUGHED HER FAITH IN HIM WAS PLEASANT
4964-30587-0014 HE HAD NO THOUGHT BUT THAT HE WOULD PROVE WORTHY OF IT THE COVE SO CALLED WAS A LITTLE FISHING HAMLET SITUATED ON THE LOW SANDY SHORE OF A SMALL BAY THE HOUSES CLUSTERED IN ONE SPOT SEEMED LIKE NOTHING SO MUCH AS LARGER SHELLS WASHED UP BY THE SEA
4964-30587-0015 SO GREY AND BLEACHED WERE THEY FROM LONG EXPOSURE TO SEA WINDS AND SPRAY DOZENS OF RAGGED CHILDREN WERE PLAYING ABOUT THEM MINGLED WITH SEVERAL DISREPUTABLE YELLOW CURS THAT YAPPED NOISILY AT THE STRANGERS
4964-30587-0016 DOWN ON THE SANDY STRIP OF BEACH BELOW THE HOUSES GROUPS OF MEN WERE LOUNGING ABOUT THE MACKEREL SEASON HAD NOT YET SET IN THE SPRING HERRING NETTING WAS PAST IT WAS HOLIDAY TIME AMONG THE SEA FOLKS THEY WERE ENJOYING IT TO THE FULL
4964-30587-0017 A HAPPY RAGGED COLONY CARELESS OF WHAT THE MORROWS MIGHT BRING FORTH OUT BEYOND THE BOATS WERE AT ANCHOR FLOATING AS GRACEFULLY ON THE TWINKLING WATER AS SEA BIRDS THEIR TALL MASTS BOWING LANDWARD ON THE SWELL
4964-30587-0018 A LAZY DREAMFUL CALM HAD FALLEN OVER THE DISTANT SEAS THE HORIZON BLUES WERE PALE AND DIM FAINT PURPLE HAZES BLURRED THE OUTLINES OF FAR OFF HEADLANDS AND CLIFFS THE YELLOW SANDS SPARKLED IN THE SUNSHINE AS IF POWDERED WITH JEWELS
4964-30587-0019 A MURMUROUS BABBLE OF LIFE BUZZED ABOUT THE HAMLET PIERCED THROUGH BY THE SHRILL UNDERTONES OF THE WRANGLING CHILDREN
4964-30587-0020 MARIAN LED THE WAY TO A HOUSE APART FROM THE OTHERS AT THE VERY EDGE OF THE SHELVING ROCK THE DOORYARD WAS SCRUPULOUSLY CLEAN AND UNLITTERED
4964-30587-0021 STANDING IN THE CREPUSCULAR LIGHT OF THE CORNER HER MARVELLOUS BEAUTY SHONE OUT WITH THE VIVID RICHNESS OF SOME RARE PAINTING SHE WAS TALL AND THE MAGNIFICENT PROPORTIONS OF HER FIGURE WERE ENHANCED RATHER THAN MARRED BY THE SEVERELY PLAIN DRESS OF DARK PRINT THAT SHE WORE
4964-30587-0022 THE HEAVY MASSES OF HER HAIR A SHINING AUBURN DASHED WITH GOLDEN FOAM WERE COILED IN A RICH GLOSSY KNOT AT THE BACK OF THE CLASSICALLY MODELLED HEAD AND RIPPLED BACK FROM A LOW BROW WHOSE WAXEN FAIRNESS EVEN THE BREEZES OF THE OCEAN HAD SPARED
4964-30587-0023 THE GIRL'S FACE WAS A FULL PERFECT OVAL WITH FEATURES OF FAULTLESS REGULARITY AND THE LARGE FULL EYES WERE OF TAWNY HAZEL DARKENED INTO INSCRUTABLE GLOOM IN THE DIMNESS OF THE CORNER NOT EVEN MARIAN LESLEY'S FACE WAS MORE DELICATELY TINTED
4964-30587-0024 THERE WAS NO TRACE OF EMBARRASSMENT OR SELF CONSCIOUSNESS IN HER POSE WHEN MISSUS BARRETT SAID THIS IS MY NIECE MAGDALEN CRAWFORD SHE MERELY INCLINED HER HEAD IN GRAVE SILENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
4964-30587-0025 MARIAN ROSE AND WENT OVER TO THE COT LAYING HER SLENDER HAND ON THE HOT FOREHEAD OF THE LITTLE SUFFERER THE CHILD OPENED ITS BROWN EYES QUESTIONINGLY HOW ARE YOU TODAY BESSIE MAD'LEN I WANT MAD'LEN
4964-30587-0026 MOANED THE LITTLE PLAINTIVE VOICE MAGDALEN CAME OVER AND STOOD BESIDE MARIAN LESLEY SHE WANTS ME SHE SAID IN A LOW THRILLING VOICE FREE FROM ALL HARSH ACCENT OR INTONATION I AM THE ONLY ONE SHE SEEMS TO KNOW ALWAYS
4964-30587-0027 YES DARLING MAD'LEN IS HERE RIGHT BESIDE YOU SHE WILL NOT LEAVE YOU SHE KNELT BY THE LITTLE COT AND PASSED HER ARM UNDER THE CHILD'S NECK DRAWING THE CURLY HEAD CLOSE TO HER THROAT WITH A TENDER SOOTHING MOTION
4964-30587-0028 ESTERBROOK ELLIOTT WATCHED THE TWO WOMEN INTENTLY THE ONE STANDING BY THE COT ARRAYED IN SIMPLE YET COSTLY APPAREL WITH HER BEAUTIFUL HIGH BRED FACE AND THE OTHER KNEELING ON THE BARE SANDED FLOOR IN HER PRINT DRESS WITH HER SPLENDID HEAD BENT LOW OVER THE CHILD
4964-30587-0029 AND THE LONG FRINGE OF BURNISHED LASHES SWEEPING THE COLD PALLOR OF THE OVAL CHEEK FROM THE MOMENT THAT MAGDALEN CRAWFORD'S HAUNTING EYES HAD LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO HIS FOR ONE FLEETING SECOND AN UNNAMABLE THRILL OF PAIN AND PLEASURE STIRRED HIS HEART
4964-30587-0030 A THRILL SO STRONG AND SUDDEN AND PASSIONATE THAT HIS FACE PALED WITH EMOTION THE ROOM SEEMED TO SWIM BEFORE HIS EYES IN A MIST OUT OF WHICH GLEAMED THAT WONDERFUL FACE WITH ITS MESMERIC DARKLY RADIANT EYES
4964-30587-0031 WHEN THE MIST CLEARED AWAY AND HIS HEAD GREW STEADIER HE WONDERED AT HIMSELF YET HE TREMBLED IN EVERY LIMB AND THE ONLY CLEAR IDEA THAT STRUGGLED OUT OF HIS CONFUSED THOUGHTS WAS AN OVERMASTERING DESIRE TO TAKE THAT COLD FACE BETWEEN HIS HANDS AND KISS IT
4964-30587-0032 I MUST SEE WHAT I CAN DO FOR HER BUT HER MANNER SEEMED RATHER REPELLENT DON'T YOU THINK HARDLY RESPONDED ESTERBROOK CURTLY SHE SEEMED SURPRISINGLY DIGNIFIED AND SELF POSSESSED I FANCIED FOR A GIRL IN HER POSITION A PRINCESS COULD NOT HAVE LOOKED AND BOWED MORE ROYALLY
4964-30587-0033 YOU HAD MUCH BETTER LEAVE HER ALONE MARIAN IN ALL PROBABILITY SHE WOULD RESENT ANY CONDESCENSION ON YOUR PART WHAT WONDERFUL DEEP LOVELY EYES SHE HAS AGAIN THE SENSITIVE COLOUR FLUSHED MARIAN'S CHEEK
4964-30587-0034 AS HIS VOICE LAPSED UNCONSCIOUSLY INTO A DREAMY RETROSPECTIVE TONE AND A SLIGHT RESTRAINT CAME OVER HER MANNER WHICH DID NOT DEPART ESTERBROOK WENT AWAY AT SUNSET MARIAN ASKED HIM TO REMAIN FOR THE EVENING
4964-30587-0035 BUT HE PLEADED SOME EXCUSE I SHALL COME TOMORROW AFTERNOON HE SAID AS HE STOOPED TO DROP A CARELESS GOOD BYE KISS ON HER FACE MARIAN WATCHED HIM WISTFULLY AS HE RODE AWAY WITH AN UNACCOUNTABLE PAIN IN HER HEART
4964-30587-0036 SHE FELT MORE ACUTELY THAN EVER THAT THERE WERE DEPTHS IN HER LOVER'S NATURE THAT SHE WAS POWERLESS TO STIR INTO RESPONSIVE LIFE HAD ANY OTHER THAT POWER SHE THOUGHT OF THE GIRL AT THE COVE WITH HER DEEP EYES AND WONDERFUL FACE
4964-30587-0037 A CHILL OF PREMONITORY FEAR SEIZED UPON HER I FEEL EXACTLY AS IF ESTERBROOK HAD GONE AWAY FROM ME FOREVER SHE SAID SLOWLY TO HERSELF
4964-30587-0038 STOOPING TO BRUSH HER CHEEK AGAINST A DEW COLD MILK WHITE ACACIA BLOOM AND WOULD NEVER COME BACK TO ME AGAIN IF THAT COULD HAPPEN I WONDER WHAT THERE WOULD BE LEFT TO LIVE FOR
4964-30587-0039 ESTERBROOK ELLIOTT MEANT OR HONESTLY THOUGHT HE MEANT TO GO HOME WHEN HE LEFT MARIAN
4964-30587-0040 NEVERTHELESS WHEN HE REACHED THE ROAD BRANCHING OFF TO THE COVE HE TURNED HIS HORSE DOWN IT WITH A FLUSH ON HIS DARK CHEEK HE REALIZED THAT THE MOTIVE OF THE ACTION WAS DISLOYAL TO MARIAN AND HE FELT ASHAMED OF HIS WEAKNESS BUT THE DESIRE TO SEE MAGDALEN CRAWFORD ONCE MORE AND TO LOOK INTO THE DEPTHS OF HER EYES WAS STRONGER THAN ALL ELSE AND OVERPOWERED EVERY THROB OF DUTY AND RESISTANCE
4964-30587-0041 HE SAW NOTHING OF HER WHEN HE REACHED THE COVE HE COULD THINK OF NO EXCUSE FOR CALLING AT THE BARRETT COTTAGE SO HE RODE SLOWLY PAST THE HAMLET AND ALONG THE SHORE THE SUN RED AS A SMOULDERING EMBER
4964-30587-0042 WAS HALF BURIED IN THE SILKEN VIOLET RIM OF THE SEA THE WEST WAS A VAST LAKE OF SAFFRON AND ROSE AND ETHEREAL GREEN THROUGH WHICH FLOATED THE CURVED SHALLOP OF A THIN NEW MOON
4964-30587-0043 THROUGH GLEAMING SILVER INTO BURNISHED GOLD AND ATTENDED BY ONE SOLITARY PEARL WHITE STAR THE VAST CONCAVE OF SKY ABOVE WAS OF VIOLET INFINITE AND FLAWLESS
4964-30587-0044 THE LITTLE POOLS OF WATER ALONG THE LOW SHORES GLOWED LIKE MIRRORS OF POLISHED JACINTH THE SMALL PINE FRINGED HEADLANDS RAN OUT INTO THE WATER CUTTING ITS LUSTROUS BLUE EXPANSE LIKE PURPLE WEDGES
4964-30587-0045 AS ESTERBROOK TURNED ONE OF THEM HE SAW MAGDALEN STANDING OUT ON THE POINT OF THE NEXT A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY HER BACK WAS TOWARDS HIM AND HER SPLENDID FIGURE WAS OUTLINED DARKLY AGAINST THE VIVID SKY
4964-30587-0046 ESTERBROOK SPRANG FROM HIS HORSE AND LEFT THE ANIMAL STANDING BY ITSELF WHILE HE WALKED SWIFTLY OUT TO HER HIS HEART THROBBED SUFFOCATINGLY HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF NO DIRECT PURPOSE SAVE MERELY TO SEE HER SHE TURNED WHEN HE REACHED HER WITH A SLIGHT START OF SURPRISE
4964-30587-0047 HIS FOOTSTEPS HAD MADE NO SOUND ON THE TIDE RIPPLED SAND FOR A FEW MOMENTS THEY FACED EACH OTHER SO EYES BURNING INTO EYES WITH MUTE SOUL PROBING AND QUESTIONING THE SUN HAD DISAPPEARED LEAVING A STAIN OF FIERY RED TO MARK HIS GRAVE
4964-30587-0048 THE WEIRD RADIANT LIGHT WAS STARTLINGLY VIVID AND CLEAR LITTLE CRISP PUFFS AND FLAKES OF FOAM SCURRIED OVER THE POINT LIKE ELFIN THINGS THE FRESH WIND BLOWING UP THE BAY TOSSED THE LUSTROUS RINGS OF HAIR ABOUT MAGDALEN'S PALE FACE
4964-30587-0049 ALL THE ROUTED SHADOWS OF THE HOUR HAD FOUND REFUGE IN HER EYES NOT A TRACE OF COLOUR APPEARED IN HER FACE UNDER ESTERBROOK ELLIOTT'S BURNING GAZE BUT WHEN HE SAID MAGDALEN
4964-30587-0050 A SINGLE HOT SCORCH OF CRIMSON FLAMED UP INTO HER CHEEKS PROTESTINGLY SHE LIFTED HER HAND WITH A SPLENDID GESTURE BUT NO WORD PASSED HER LIPS MAGDALEN
4964-30587-0051 HAVE YOU NOTHING TO SAY TO ME HE ASKED COMING CLOSER TO HER WITH AN IMPLORING PASSION IN HIS FACE NEVER SEEN BY MARIAN LESLEY'S EYES HE REACHED OUT HIS HAND BUT SHE STEPPED BACK FROM HIS TOUCH WHAT SHOULD I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE GLAD TO SEE ME
4964-30587-0052 BUT I KNEW YOU WOULD COME YOU KNEW IT HOW YOUR EYES TOLD ME SO TODAY I AM NOT BLIND I CAN SEE FURTHER THAN THOSE DULL FISHER FOLKS YES I KNEW YOU WOULD COME
4964-30587-0053 WHY MUST YOU TELL ME THAT MAGDALEN
4964-30587-0054 BUT IF I WILL NOT OBEY YOU IF I WILL COME IN DEFIANCE OF YOUR PROHIBITION SHE TURNED HER STEADY LUMINOUS EYES ON HIS PALE SET FACE YOU WOULD STAMP YOURSELF AS A MADMAN THEN SHE SAID COLDLY I KNOW THAT YOU ARE MISS LESLEY'S PROMISED HUSBAND
4964-30587-0055 THEREFORE YOU ARE EITHER FALSE TO HER OR INSULTING TO ME IN EITHER CASE THE COMPANIONSHIP OF MAGDALEN CRAWFORD IS NOT WHAT YOU MUST SEEK GO SHE TURNED AWAY FROM HIM WITH AN IMPERIOUS GESTURE OF DISMISSAL
4964-30587-0056 ESTERBROOK ELLIOTT STEPPED FORWARD AND CAUGHT ONE FIRM WHITE WRIST I SHALL NOT OBEY YOU HE SAID IN A LOW INTENSE TONE HIS FINE EYES BURNED INTO HERS YOU MAY SEND ME AWAY BUT I WILL COME BACK AGAIN AND YET AGAIN UNTIL YOU HAVE LEARNED TO WELCOME ME
4964-30587-0057 WHY SHOULD YOU MEET ME LIKE AN ENEMY WHY CAN WE NOT BE FRIENDS THE GIRL FACED HIM ONCE MORE BECAUSE SHE SAID PROUDLY
4964-30587-0058 I AM NOT YOUR EQUAL THERE CAN BE NO FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN US THERE OUGHT NOT TO BE MAGDALEN CRAWFORD THE FISHERMAN'S NIECE IS NO COMPANION FOR YOU YOU WILL BE FOOLISH AS WELL AS DISLOYAL IF YOU EVER TRY TO SEE ME AGAIN
4964-30587-0059 GO BACK TO THE BEAUTIFUL HIGH BRED WOMAN YOU LOVE AND FORGET ME PERHAPS YOU THINK I AM TALKING STRANGELY PERHAPS YOU THINK ME BOLD AND UNWOMANLY TO SPEAK SO PLAINLY TO YOU A STRANGER BUT THERE ARE SOME CIRCUMSTANCES IN LIFE WHEN PLAIN SPEAKING IS BEST I DO NOT WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN
4964-30587-0060 NOW GO BACK TO YOUR OWN WORLD ESTERBROOK ELLIOTT SLOWLY TURNED FROM HER AND WALKED IN SILENCE BACK TO THE SHORE
4964-30587-0061 IN THE SHADOWS OF THE POINT HE STOPPED TO LOOK BACK AT HER STANDING OUT LIKE SOME INSPIRED PROPHETESS AGAINST THE FIERY BACKGROUND OF THE SUNSET SKY AND SILVER BLUE WATER THE SKY OVERHEAD WAS THICK SOWN WITH STARS
4964-30587-0062 MAGDALEN CRAWFORD LINGERED ON THE POINT UNTIL THE LAST DULL RED FADED OUT INTO THE VIOLET GLOOM OF THE JUNE SEA DUSK THAN WHICH NOTHING CAN BE RARER OR DIVINER
4964-30587-0063 AND LISTENED TO THE MOAN AND MURMUR OF THE SEA FAR OUT OVER THE BAY WITH SORROWFUL EYES AND STERNLY SET LIPS
4964-30587-0064 HE FOUND IT DESERTED A RUMOUR OF MACKEREL HAD COME AND EVERY BOAT HAD SAILED OUT
4964-30587-0065 SHE WAS WATCHING A HUDDLE OF GULLS CLUSTERED ON THE TIP OF A NARROW SANDY SPIT
4964-30587-0066 FOOT FALL BEHIND HER HER FACE PALED SLIGHTLY AND INTO THE DEPTHS OF HER EYES LEAPT A PASSIONATE MESMERIC GLOW THAT FADED AS QUICKLY AS IT CAME YOU SEE I HAVE COME BACK IN SPITE OF YOUR COMMAND MAGDALEN I DO SEE IT
4964-30587-0067 SHE ANSWERED IN A GRAVELY TROUBLED VOICE
4964-30587-0068 WHERE ARE YOU GOING MAGDALEN SHE HAD LOOSENED THE ROPE FROM THE WRECK I AM GOING TO ROW OVER TO CHAPEL POINT FOR SALT THEY THINK THE BOATS WILL COME IN TONIGHT LOADED WITH MACKEREL
4964-30587-0069 CAN YOU ROW SO FAR ALONE EASILY
4964-30587-0070 SINCE COMING HERE I FIND IT OF GREAT SERVICE TO ME SHE STEPPED LIGHTLY INTO THE TINY SHALLOP AND PICKED UP AN OAR THE BRILLIANT SUNSHINE STREAMED ABOUT HER
4964-30587-0071 THE MAN LOOKING AT HER FELT HIS BRAIN REEL GOOD BYE MISTER ELLIOTT FOR ANSWER HE SPRANG INTO THE DORY AND SNATCHING AN OAR PUSHED AGAINST THE OLD WRECK WITH SUCH ENERGY THAT THE DORY SHOT OUT FROM THE SHORE LIKE A FOAM BELL
4964-30587-0072 HIS SUDDEN SPRING HAD SET IT ROCKING VIOLENTLY MAGDALEN ALMOST LOST HER FOOTING AND CAUGHT BLINDLY AT HIS ARM AS HER FINGERS CLOSED ON HIS WRIST A THRILL AS OF FIRE SHOT THROUGH HIS EVERY VEIN
4964-30587-0073 WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS MISTER ELLIOTT YOU MUST GO BACK BUT I WILL NOT HE SAID MASTERFULLY LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO HER EYES WITH AN IMPERIOUSNESS THAT SAT WELL UPON HIM I AM GOING TO ROW YOU OVER TO CHAPEL POINT I HAVE THE OARS I WILL BE MASTER THIS ONCE AT LEAST
4964-30587-0074 FOR AN INSTANT HER EYES FLASHED DEFIANT PROTEST THEN DROOPED BEFORE HIS A SUDDEN HOT BLUSH CRIMSONED HER PALE FACE HIS WILL HAD MASTERED HERS THE GIRL TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND THE PROUD SENSITIVE MOUTH QUIVERED
4964-30587-0075 INTO THE FACE OF THE MAN WATCHING HER BREATHLESSLY FLASHED A TRIUMPHANT PASSIONATE JOY HE PUT OUT HIS HAND AND GENTLY PUSHED HER DOWN INTO THE SEAT SITTING OPPOSITE HE TOOK UP THE OARS AND PULLED OUT OVER THE SHEET OF SPARKLING BLUE WATER
4964-30587-0076 THROUGH WHICH AT FIRST THE BOTTOM OF WHITE SAND GLIMMERED WAVILY BUT AFTERWARDS DEEPENED TO TRANSLUCENT DIM DEPTHS OF GREENNESS HIS HEART THROBBED TUMULTUOUSLY ONCE THE THOUGHT OF MARIAN DRIFTED ACROSS HIS MIND LIKE A CHILL BREATH OF WIND
4964-30587-0077 BUT IT WAS FORGOTTEN WHEN HIS EYES MET MAGDALEN'S TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF MAGDALEN HE SAID AT LAST BREAKING THE TREMULOUS CHARMED SPARKLING SILENCE
4964-30587-0078 YOU MUST NOT GO AWAY MAGDALEN YOU MUST STAY HERE WITH ME YOU FORGET YOURSELF SHE SAID PROUDLY HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME SO HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN MISS LESLEY OR ARE YOU A TRAITOR TO US BOTH
4964-30587-0079 ESTERBROOK MADE NO ANSWER HE BOWED HIS PALE MISERABLE FACE BEFORE HER SELF CONDEMNED THE BREAST OF THE BAY SPARKLED WITH ITS COUNTLESS GEMS LIKE THE BREAST OF A FAIR WOMAN
4964-30587-0080 THE SHORES WERE PURPLE AND AMETHYSTINE IN THE DISTANCE FAR OUT BLUISH PHANTOM LIKE SAILS CLUSTERED AGAINST THE PALLID HORIZON THE DORY DANCED LIKE A FEATHER OVER THE RIPPLES THEY WERE CLOSE UNDER THE SHADOW OF CHAPEL POINT
4964-30587-0081 MARIAN LESLEY WAITED IN VAIN FOR HER LOVER THAT AFTERNOON
4964-30587-0082 WHEN HE CAME AT LAST IN THE ODOROUS DUSK OF THE JUNE NIGHT SHE MET HIM ON THE ACACIA SHADOWED VERANDAH WITH COLD SWEETNESS PERHAPS SOME SUBTLE WOMAN INSTINCT WHISPERED TO HER WHERE AND HOW HE HAD SPENT THE AFTERNOON FOR SHE OFFERED HIM NO KISS
4964-30587-0083 HIS EYES LINGERED ON HER IN THE DIM LIGHT TAKING IN EVERY DETAIL OF HER SWEET WOMANLY REFINEMENT AND LOVELINESS AND WITH DIFFICULTY HE CHOKED BACK A GROAN
4964-30587-0084 AGAIN HE ASKED HIMSELF WHAT MADNESS HAD COME OVER HIM AND AGAIN FOR AN ANSWER ROSE UP THE VISION OF MAGDALEN CRAWFORD'S FACE AS HE HAD SEEN IT THAT DAY CRIMSONING BENEATH HIS GAZE IT WAS LATE WHEN HE LEFT
4964-30587-0085 FOR IT MAY NEVER HAVE BEEN MINE I KNOW THAT ESTERBROOK ELLIOTT WILL BE TRUE TO THE LETTER OF HIS VOWS TO ME NO MATTER WHAT IT MAY COST HIM BUT I WANT NO PALLID SHADOW OF THE LOVE THAT BELONGS TO ANOTHER THE HOUR OF ABDICATION IS AT HAND I FEAR AND WHAT WILL BE LEFT FOR THRONELESS VASHTI THEN
4964-30587-0086 ESTERBROOK ELLIOTT WALKING HOME THROUGH THE MOCKING CALM OF THE NIGHT FOUGHT A HARD BATTLE WITH HIMSELF HE WAS FACE TO FACE WITH THE TRUTH AT LAST THE BITTER KNOWLEDGE THAT HE HAD NEVER LOVED MARIAN LESLEY SAVE WITH A FOND BROTHERLY AFFECTION
4964-30587-0087 AND THAT HE DID LOVE MAGDALEN CRAWFORD WITH A PASSION THAT THREATENED TO SWEEP BEFORE IT EVERY VESTIGE OF HIS HONOUR AND LOYALTY HE HAD SEEN HER BUT THREE TIMES AND HIS THROBBING HEART LAY IN THE HOLLOW OF HER COLD WHITE HAND HE SHUT HIS EYES AND GROANED
4964-30587-0088 WHAT MADNESS WHAT UNUTTERABLE FOLLY HE WAS NOT FREE HE WAS BOUND TO ANOTHER BY EVERY CORD OF HONOUR AND SELF RESPECT AND EVEN WERE HE FREE MAGDALEN CRAWFORD WOULD BE NO FIT WIFE FOR HIM
4964-30587-0089 IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD AT LEAST A GIRL FROM THE COVE A GIRL WITH LITTLE EDUCATION AND NO SOCIAL STANDING AYE BUT HE LOVED HER HE GROANED AGAIN AND AGAIN IN HIS MISERY
4964-30587-0090 IF HE HAD WEAKLY GIVEN WAY TO THE FIRST MAD SWEEP OF A NEW PASSION THE STRENGTH OF HIS MANHOOD REASSERTED ITSELF AT LAST FALTERING AND WAVERING WERE OVER THOUGH THERE WAS PASSIONATE PAIN IN HIS VOICE WHEN HE SAID AT LAST
4964-30587-0091 I AM NOT COMING BACK AGAIN MAGDALEN THEY WERE STANDING IN THE SHADOW OF THE PINE FRINGED POINT THAT RAN OUT TO THE LEFT OF THE COVE THEY HAD BEEN WALKING TOGETHER ALONG THE SHORE WATCHING THE SPLENDOUR OF THE SEA SUNSET THAT FLAMED AND GLOWED IN THE WEST
4964-30587-0092 WHERE THERE WAS A SEA OF MACKEREL CLOUDS CRIMSON AND AMBER TINTED WITH LONG RIBBON LIKE STRIPS OF APPLE GREEN SKY BETWEEN
4964-30587-0093 YET WITH THE STIR AND THROB OF A MIGHTY PASSION SEETHING IN THEIR HEARTS MAGDALEN TURNED AS ESTERBROOK SPOKE AND LOOKED AT HIM IN A LONG SILENCE THE BAY STRETCHED OUT BEFORE THEM TRANCED AND SHIMMERING
4964-30587-0094 A FEW STARS SHONE DOWN THROUGH THE GLOOM OF DUSK RIGHT ACROSS THE TRANSLUCENT GREENS AND ROSES AND BLUES OF THE WEST HUNG A DARK UNSIGHTLY CLOUD LIKE THE BLURRED OUTLINE OF A MONSTROUS BAT IN THE DIM REFLECTED LIGHT THE GIRL'S MOURNFUL FACE
4964-30587-0095 TOOK ON A WEIRD UNEARTHLY BEAUTY
4964-30587-0096 THAT IS BEST SHE ANSWERED AT LAST SLOWLY BEST YES BETTER THAT WE HAD NEVER MET I LOVE YOU YOU KNOW IT WORDS ARE IDLE BETWEEN US
4964-30587-0097 I NEVER LOVED BEFORE I THOUGHT I DID I MADE A MISTAKE AND I MUST PAY THE PENALTY OF THAT MISTAKE YOU UNDERSTAND ME I UNDERSTAND SHE ANSWERED SIMPLY I DO NOT EXCUSE MYSELF I HAVE BEEN WEAK AND COWARDLY AND DISLOYAL
4964-30587-0098 BUT I HAVE CONQUERED MYSELF I WILL BE TRUE TO THE WOMAN TO WHOM I AM PLEDGED YOU AND I MUST NOT MEET AGAIN I WILL CRUSH THIS MADNESS TO DEATH I THINK I HAVE BEEN DELIRIOUS EVER SINCE THAT DAY I SAW YOU FIRST MAGDALEN
4964-30587-0099 MY BRAIN IS CLEARER NOW I SEE MY DUTY AND I MEAN TO DO IT AT ANY COST I DARE NOT TRUST MYSELF TO SAY MORE
4964-30587-0100 I HAVE BEEN WEAK TOO AND I DESERVE TO ATONE FOR MY WEAKNESS BY SUFFERING THERE IS ONLY ONE PATH OPEN TO US ESTERBROOK GOOD BYE
4964-30587-0101 MAGDALEN GOOD BYE MY DARLING KISS ME ONCE ONLY ONCE BEFORE I GO SHE LOOSENED HIS ARMS AND STEPPED BACK PROUDLY NO
4964-30587-0102 HE BOWED HIS HEAD SILENTLY AND WENT AWAY LOOKING BACK NOT ONCE ELSE HE MIGHT HAVE SEEN HER KNEELING ON THE DAMP SAND WEEPING NOISELESSLY AND PASSIONATELY
4964-30587-0103 MARIAN LESLEY LOOKED AT HIS PALE DETERMINED FACE THE NEXT EVENING AND READ IT LIKE AN OPEN BOOK SHE HAD GROWN PALER HERSELF
4964-30587-0104 SHE SAW THE TRACES OF THE STRUGGLE THROUGH WHICH HE HAD PASSED AND KNEW THAT HE HAD COME OFF VICTOR THE KNOWLEDGE MADE HER TASK A LITTLE HARDER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER TO LET SLIP THE STRAINING CABLE THAN TO CAST IT FROM HER WHEN IT LAY UNRESISTINGLY IN HER HAND FOR AN INSTANT
4964-30587-0105 MIGHT HE NOT FORGET IN TIME NEED SHE SNAP IN TWAIN THE WEAKENED BOND BETWEEN THEM AFTER ALL PERHAPS SHE MIGHT WIN BACK HER LOST SCEPTRE YET IF WOMANLY PRIDE THROTTLED THE STRUGGLING HOPE
4964-30587-0106 NO DIVIDED ALLEGIANCE NO HOLLOW SEMBLANCE OF QUEENSHIP FOR HER
4964-30587-0107 COULD HE NOT HAVE HIS BRIDE IN AUGUST FOR A FLEETING SECOND MARIAN CLOSED HER EYES AND THE SLENDER HANDS LYING AMONG THE LACES IN HER LAP CLASPED EACH OTHER CONVULSIVELY THEN SHE SAID QUIETLY
4964-30587-0108 SOMETIMES I HAVE THOUGHT ESTERBROOK THAT IT MIGHT BE BETTER IF WE WERE NEVER MARRIED AT ALL ESTERBROOK TURNED A STARTLED FACE UPON HER NOT MARRIED AT ALL MARIAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN JUST WHAT I SAY
4964-30587-0109 I DO NOT THINK WE ARE AS WELL SUITED TO EACH OTHER AFTER ALL AS WE HAVE FANCIED
4964-30587-0110 THAT IS ALL I THINK IT WILL BE BEST TO BE BROTHER AND SISTER FOREVER NOTHING MORE ESTERBROOK SPRANG TO HIS FEET MARIAN DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING

4964-30587-0112 THE TIME FOR THAT HAS GONE BY I WOULD NEVER BE SATISFIED NOR WOULD YOU ESTERBROOK WILL YOU RELEASE ME FROM A PROMISE WHICH HAS BECOME AN IRKSOME FETTER HE LOOKED DOWN ON HER UPTURNED FACE MISTILY
4964-30587-0113 A GREAT JOY WAS SURGING UP IN HIS HEART YET IT WAS MINGLED WITH GREAT REGRET HE KNEW NONE BETTER WHAT WAS PASSING OUT OF HIS LIFE WHAT HE WAS LOSING WHEN HE LOST THAT PURE WOMANLY NATURE IF YOU REALLY MEAN THIS MARIAN HE SAID SLOWLY
4964-30587-0114 IF YOU REALLY HAVE COME TO FEEL THAT YOUR TRUEST LOVE IS NOT AND NEVER CAN BE MINE THAT I CANNOT MAKE YOU HAPPY THEN THERE IS NOTHING FOR ME TO DO BUT TO GRANT YOUR REQUEST YOU ARE FREE
4964-30587-0115 THANK YOU DEAR SHE SAID GENTLY AS SHE STOOD UP SHE SLIPPED HIS RING FROM HER FINGER AND HELD IT OUT TO HIM HE TOOK IT MECHANICALLY HE STILL FELT DAZED AND UNREAL MARIAN HELD OUT HER HAND
