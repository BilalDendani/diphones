6735-284431-0019 ONLY THOSE ABLE TO FORGET FIND THE MOST JOY IN LIFE
6735-284431-0020 SET ON THE ENDS OF LONG THIN NECKS SEEMED SO GROTESQUE TO THE STRANGERS THAT THEY COULD SCARCELY FORBEAR LAUGHING AT THEM
6735-284431-0021 THE BODIES OF THESE PEOPLE WERE SHORT AND ROUND AND THEIR LEGS EXCEPTIONALLY LONG SO WHEN A BLUESKIN WALKED HE COVERED TWICE AS MUCH GROUND AT ONE STEP AS CAP'N BILL OR BUTTON BRIGHT DID
6735-284431-0022 THE WOMEN SEEMED JUST AS REPELLENT AS THE MEN AND BUTTON BRIGHT BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE SIX
6735-284431-0023 THERE WERE NO HORSES NOR COWS IN THIS LAND BUT THERE WERE PLENTY OF BLUE GOATS FROM WHICH THE PEOPLE GOT THEIR MILK CHILDREN TENDED THE GOATS

6735-284431-0025 THEY TOOK A STRONG DISLIKE TO THE STRANGERS AND SEVERAL TIMES THREATENED TO ATTACK THEM
6735-284431-0026 BUT GHIP GHISIZZLE'S FRIENDLY PROTECTION MADE THEM HOLD ALOOF BY AND BY THEY PASSED THROUGH A CITY GATE AND THEIR GUIDE SHOWED THEM THE OUTER WALLS WHICH PROTECTED THE CITY FROM THE COUNTRY BEYOND

6735-284431-0031 AND RED WOULDN'T IT BE HORRIBLE TO BE OBLIGED TO LOOK UPON SUCH A SIGHT IT MUST GIVE THE POOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE DREADFUL HEADACHES
