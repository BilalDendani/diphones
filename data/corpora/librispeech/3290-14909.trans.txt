3290-14909-0000 NO MORE AFFECTIONATE CREATURE IS TO BE FOUND YET HE POSSESSES CONSIDERABLE DETERMINATION AND PLUCK AND ON OCCASION WILL DEFEND HIMSELF IN HIS OWN WAY TOO FRAGILE IN HIS ANATOMY FOR FIGHTING IN THE ORDINARY SENSE OF THE WORD
3290-14909-0001 WHEN MOLESTED HE WILL SNAP AT HIS OPPONENT WITH SUCH CELERITY AS TO TAKE EVEN THE MOST WATCHFUL BY SURPRISE WHILE HIS STRENGTH OF JAW COMBINED WITH ITS COMPARATIVELY GREAT LENGTH ENABLES HIM TO INFLICT SEVERE PUNISHMENT AT THE FIRST GRAB
3290-14909-0002 IT WAS PROBABLY OWING TO THIS HABIT WHICH IS COMMON TO ALL WHIPPETS THAT THEY WERE ORIGINALLY KNOWN AS SNAP DOGS THE WHIPPET EXISTED AS A SEPARATE BREED LONG BEFORE DOG SHOWS WERE THOUGHT OF
3290-14909-0003 AND AT A TIME WHEN RECORDS OF PEDIGREES WERE NOT OFFICIALLY PRESERVED BUT IT IS VERY CERTAIN THAT THE GREYHOUND HAD A SHARE IN HIS GENEALOGICAL HISTORY FOR NOT ONLY SHOULD HIS APPEARANCE BE PRECISELY THAT OF A GREYHOUND IN MINIATURE
3290-14909-0004 BUT THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH HE WAS BRED IS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT FOR WHICH HIS LARGER PROTOTYPE IS STILL USED THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING THAT RABBITS WERE COURSED BY WHIPPETS AND HARES BY GREYHOUNDS
3290-14909-0005 THIS SPORT HAS BEEN MAINLY CONFINED TO THE WORKING CLASSES THE COLLIERS OF LANCASHIRE YORKSHIRE DURHAM AND NORTHUMBERLAND BEING PARTICULARLY DEVOTED TO IT AS A RULE THE CONTESTS ARE HANDICAPS
3290-14909-0006 THE STARTING POINT OF EACH COMPETITOR BEING REGULATED BY ITS WEIGHT BUT THE WINNERS OF PREVIOUS IMPORTANT EVENTS ARE PENALISED IN ADDITION ACCORDING TO THEIR PRESUMED MERIT BY HAVING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YARDS DEDUCTED FROM THE START
3290-14909-0007 TO WHICH WEIGHT ALONE WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE ENTITLED THEM EACH DOG IS TAKEN TO ITS STIPULATED MARK ACCORDING TO THE HANDICAP AND THERE LAID HOLD OF BY THE NAPE OF THE NECK AND HIND QUARTERS THE REAL STARTER STANDS BEHIND THE LOT
3290-14909-0008 AND AFTER WARNING ALL TO BE READY DISCHARGES A PISTOL UPON WHICH EACH ATTENDANT SWINGS HIS DOG AS FAR FORWARD AS HE CAN POSSIBLY THROW HIM BUT ALWAYS MAKING SURE THAT HE ALIGHTS ON HIS FEET
3290-14909-0009 THE DISTANCE COVERED IN THE RACE IS GENERALLY TWO HUNDRED YARDS MINUS THE STARTS ALLOTTED AND SOME IDEA OF THE SPEED AT WHICH THESE VERY ACTIVE LITTLE ANIMALS CAN TRAVEL MAY BE GLEANED FROM THE FACT THAT THE FULL DISTANCE HAS BEEN COVERED
3290-14909-0010 IN RATHER UNDER TWELVE SECONDS IN ORDER TO INDUCE EACH DOG TO DO ITS BEST THE OWNER OR MORE PROBABLY THE TRAINER STANDS BEYOND THE WINNING POST AND FRANTICALLY WAVES A TOWEL OR VERY STOUT RAG ACCOMPANIED BY A BABEL OF NOISE
3290-14909-0011 THE RACE IS STARTED AND IN LESS TIME THAN IT TAKES TO WRITE IT THE COMPETITORS REACH THE GOAL ONE AND ALL AS THEY FINISH TAKING A FLYING LEAP AT THEIR TRAINER'S TOWEL TO WHICH THEY HOLD ON WITH SUCH TENACITY THAT THEY ARE SWUNG ROUND IN THE AIR
3290-14909-0012 THE SPEED AT WHICH THEY ARE TRAVELLING MAKES THIS MOVEMENT NECESSARY IN MANY CASES TO ENABLE THE DOG TO AVOID ACCIDENT PARTICULARLY WHERE THE SPACE BEYOND THE WINNING MARK IS LIMITED FOR RACING PURPOSES THERE IS A WIDE MARGIN OF SIZE ALLOWED TO THE DOGS
3290-14909-0013 BUT IN VIEW OF THE HANDICAP TERMS THOSE DOGS WHICH POSSESS SPEED
3290-14909-0014 ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE THE BEST CHANCE PROBABLY THERE IS NO LOCALITY WHERE THE PASTIME HAS MAINTAINED SUCH A FIRM HOLD AS IN AND AROUND OLDHAM ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS TRACKS IN THE WORLD BEING AT HIGGINSHAW
3290-14909-0015 WHERE NOT INFREQUENTLY THREE HUNDRED DOGS ARE ENTERED IN ONE HANDICAP THE BOROUGH GROUNDS AT OLDHAM AND THE WELLINGTON GROUNDS AT BURY ARE ALSO NOTED CENTRES FOR RACES
3290-14909-0016 IT IS A REMARKABLE BUT WELL RECOGNISED FACT THAT BITCHES ARE FASTER THAN DOGS AND IN CONSEQUENCE THE TERMS UPON WHICH THEY ARE HANDICAPPED ARE VARIED THE GENERAL CUSTOM IS TO ALLOW A DOG
3290-14909-0017 FOR EVERY POUND DIFFERENCE IN WEIGHT
3290-14909-0018 TO ALLOW A DOG IN TRAINING TO GAMBOL ABOUT EITHER ON THE ROADS OR IN THE FIELDS INDEED ALL DOGS WHICH ARE UNDERGOING PREPARATION FOR A RACE ARE PRACTICALLY DEPRIVED OF THEIR FREEDOM IN LIEU OF WHICH THEY ARE WALKED ALONG HARD ROADS SECURED BY A LEAD
3290-14909-0019 AND FOR FEAR OF THEIR PICKING UP THE LEAST BIT OF REFUSE EACH IS SECURELY MUZZLED BY A BOX LIKE LEATHER ARRANGEMENT WHICH COMPLETELY ENVELOPS THE JAWS BUT WHICH IS FREELY PERFORATED TO PERMIT PROPER BREATHING
3290-14909-0020 ANY DISTANCE BETWEEN SIX AND A DOZEN MILES A DAY ACCORDING TO THE STAMINA AND CONDITION OF THE DOG IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE PROPER AMOUNT OF EXERCISE AND SCALES ARE BROUGHT INTO USE EVERY FEW DAYS TO GAUGE THE EFFECT WHICH IS BEING PRODUCED
3290-14909-0021 IN ADDITION TO THIS PRIVATE TRIALS ARE NECESSARY IN THE PRESENCE OF SOMEONE WHO IS ACCUSTOMED TO TIMING RACES BY THE AID OF A STOP WATCH A BY NO MEANS EASY TASK CONSIDERING THAT A SLIGHT PARTICLE OF A SECOND
3290-14909-0022 MEANS SO MANY YARDS AND THE AVERAGE SPEED WORKING OUT AT ABOUT SIXTEEN YARDS PER SECOND NEARLY TWICE AS FAST AS THE FASTEST PEDESTRIAN SPRINTER AND ALTOGETHER BEYOND THE POWER OF THE FLEETEST RACE HORSE
3290-14909-0023 COLOUR IN THE WHIPPET IS ABSOLUTELY OF NO IMPORTANCE TO A GOOD JUDGE THOUGH POSSIBLY WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE PEACH FAWN IS THE FAVOURITE AMONG AMATEUR FANCIERS RED FAWNS BLUE OR SLATE COLOURED BLACK BRINDLED OF VARIOUS SHADES
3290-14909-0024 ARE MOST TO BE MET WITH HOWEVER IN SOME QUARTERS THE IDEA IS PREVALENT THAT WHIPPETS ARE DELICATE IN THEIR CONSTITUTION BUT THIS IS A POPULAR ERROR PROBABLY THEIR DISINCLINATION TO GO OUT OF DOORS ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE
3290-14909-0025 WHEN THE WEATHER IS COLD AND WET MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE OPINION BUT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO ROAM ABOUT A HOUSE THE WHIPPET WILL FIND A COMFORTABLE PLACE AND WILL RARELY AIL ANYTHING IN SCORES OF HOUSES WHIPPETS GO TO BED WITH THE CHILDREN
3290-14909-0026 AND ARE SO CLEAN THAT EVEN SCRUPULOUS HOUSEWIVES TAKE NO OBJECTION TO THEIR FINDING THEIR WAY UNDER THE CLOTHES TO THE FOOT OF THE BED THEREBY SECURING THEIR OWN PROTECTION AND SERVING AS AN EXCELLENT FOOTWARMER IN THE WINTER MONTHS
3290-14909-0027 PROBABLY IN NO OTHER BREED EXCEPT THE GREYHOUND DO JUDGES ATTACH SO LITTLE IMPORTANCE TO THE SHAPE OF THE HEAD SO LONG AS THE JAWS ARE FAIRLY LONG AND THE COLOUR OF THE EYES SOMEWHAT IN KEEPING WITH THAT OF THE BODY
3290-14909-0028 VERY LITTLE ELSE IS LOOKED FOR IN FRONT OF THE EARS AS IN THE CASE OF RACING COMPETITORS REALLY GOOD DOGS FOR SHOW PURPOSES ARE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND THAN BITCHES
3290-14909-0029 THE BEST OF THE MALES ARE NOT SO CLASSICAL IN OUTLINE AS THE FEMALES THOUGH SOME OF THEM ARE AS GOOD IN LEGS AND FEET POINTS WHICH ARE OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE THOUGH IT IS NOT QUITE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARD LAID DOWN BY THE CLUB IT WILL BE FOUND THAT MOST JUDGES
3290-14909-0030 WITHOUT VARIATION FOR SEX BEING CONSIDERED ALTOGETHER TOO HEAVY APPEARANCES ARE SOMETIMES DECEPTIVE BUT THESE DOGS ARE RARELY WEIGHED FOR EXHIBITION PURPOSES
3290-14909-0031 THE TRAINED EYE OF THE JUDGE BEING SUFFICIENT GUIDE TO THE SIZE OF THE COMPETITORS ACCORDING TO HIS PARTIALITY FOR MIDDLE SIZE BIG OR LITTLE ANIMALS THE SOUTH DURHAM AND YORKSHIRE SHOW AT DARLINGTON
3290-14909-0032 HAS THE CREDIT FOR FIRST INTRODUCING CLASSES FOR WHIPPETS INTO THE PRIZE RING PREVIOUS TO THIS IT HAD NOT LONG BEEN GENERALLY RECOGNISED AS A DISTINCT BREED
3290-14909-0033 AND IT IS WITHIN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THAT THE KENNEL CLUB HAS PLACED THE BREED ON ITS RECOGNISED LIST THE FOLLOWING IS THE STANDARD OF POINTS ADOPTED BY THE WHIPPET CLUB HEAD LONG AND LEAN
3290-14909-0034 RATHER WIDE BETWEEN THE EYES AND FLAT ON THE TOP THE JAW POWERFUL YET CLEANLY CUT THE TEETH LEVEL AND WHITE EYES BRIGHT AND FIERY EARS SMALL FINE IN TEXTURE AND ROSE SHAPE
3290-14909-0035 NECK LONG AND MUSCULAR ELEGANTLY ARCHED AND FREE FROM THROATINESS SHOULDERS OBLIQUE AND MUSCULAR CHEST DEEP AND CAPACIOUS BACK
3290-14909-0036 WHICH SHOULD BE STRONG AND POWERFUL FORE LEGS RATHER LONG WELL SET UNDER THE DOG POSSESSING A FAIR AMOUNT OF BONE HIND QUARTERS STRONG AND BROAD ACROSS STIFLES WELL BENT THIGHS BROAD AND MUSCULAR
