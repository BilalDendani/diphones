8470-286675-0000 THERE WAS BUT ONE SNAPPING TURTLE IN THE POND AND HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON THERE WHO HAD EVER BEEN HEARD TO WISH FOR ANOTHER HE HAD NOT ALWAYS LIVED THERE
8470-286675-0001 AND COULD JUST REMEMBER LEAVING HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHEN HE WAS YOUNG I WAS CARRIED AWAY FROM MY PEOPLE HE SAID AND KEPT ON LAND FOR A FEW DAYS THEN I WAS BROUGHT HERE
8470-286675-0002 AND HAVE MADE IT MY HOME EVER SINCE ONE COULD TELL BY LOOKING AT HIM THAT HE WAS RELATED TO THE MUD TURTLES HE HAD UPPER AND LOWER SHELLS LIKE THEM
8470-286675-0003 AND COULD DRAW IN HIS HEAD AND LEGS AND TAIL WHEN HE WANTED TO HIS SHELLS WERE GRAY QUITE THE COLOR OF A CLAY BANK AND HIS HEAD WAS LARGER THAN THOSE OF THE MUD TURTLES
8470-286675-0004 HIS TAIL WAS LONG AND SCALY AND POINTED AND HIS FORELEGS WERE LARGE AND WARTY THERE WERE FINE STRONG WEBS BETWEEN HIS TOES AS THERE WERE BETWEEN THE TOES OF HIS RELATIVES THE MUD TURTLES
8470-286675-0005 WHEN HE FIRST CAME TO LIVE IN THE POND PEOPLE WERE SORRY FOR HIM AND TRIED TO MAKE HIM FEEL AT HOME HE HAD A CHANCE TO WIN MANY FRIENDS AND HAVE ALL HIS NEIGHBORS FOND OF HIM
8470-286675-0006 BUT HE WAS TOO SNAPPY WHEN THE WATER WAS JUST WARM ENOUGH AND HIS STOMACH WAS FULL AND HE HAD SLEPT WELL THE NIGHT BEFORE AND EVERYTHING WAS EXACTLY AS HE WISHED IT TO BE AH THEN HE WAS A VERY AGREEABLE TURTLE
8470-286675-0007 AND WAS READY TO TALK IN THE MOST GRACIOUS WAY TO HIS NEIGHBORS THAT WAS ALL VERY WELL ANYBODY CAN BE GOOD NATURED WHEN EVERYTHING IS EXACTLY RIGHT AND HE CAN HAVE HIS OWN WAY
8470-286675-0008 BUT THE REALLY DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE YOU KNOW ARE THE ONES WHO ARE PLEASANT WHEN THINGS GO WRONG IT WAS A MUD TURTLE FATHER WHO FIRST SPOKE TO HIM I HOPE YOU'LL LIKE THE POND SAID HE
8470-286675-0009 I HOPE YOU DIVE WHERE THERE IS A SOFT BOTTOM SOMETIMES I DO AND SOMETIMES I DON'T ANSWERED THE SNAPPING TURTLE I CAN'T BOTHER TO SWIM DOWN SLOWLY AND TRY IT AND THEN GO BACK TO DIVE WHEN I WANT TO DIVE
8470-286675-0010 I WANT TO DIVE AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT YES SAID THE MUD TURTLE FATHER I KNOW HOW IT IS WHEN ONE HAS THE DIVING FEELING
8470-286675-0011 I HOPE YOUR HEAD WILL NOT TROUBLE YOU MUCH AND THAT YOU WILL SOON BE USED TO OUR WATERS HE SPREAD HIS TOES AND SWAM STRONGLY AWAY
8470-286675-0012 BUT I NEVER SHALL I CAN HARDLY SEE NOW FOR THE PAIN IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY HEAD WHERE I BUMPED IT OR WAS IT THE LEFT SIDE I HIT QUEER I CAN'T REMEMBER
8470-286675-0013 THEN HE SWAM TO SHALLOW WATER AND DREW HIMSELF INTO HIS SHELL AND LAY THERE
8470-286675-0014 AND WHAT POOR COMPANY HIS NEIGHBORS WERE AND WHAT A DISAGREEABLE WORLD THIS IS FOR SNAPPING TURTLES THE MUD TURTLE FATHER WENT HOME AND TOLD HIS WIFE ALL ABOUT IT WHAT A DISAGREEABLE FELLOW SHE SAID
8470-286675-0015 BUT THEN HE IS A BACHELOR AND BACHELORS ARE OFTEN QUEER I NEVER WAS SAID HER HUSBAND OH SAID SHE AND BEING A WISE WIFE SHE DID NOT SAY ANYTHING ELSE
8470-286675-0016 SHE KNEW HOWEVER THAT MISTER MUD TURTLE WAS A MUCH MORE AGREEABLE FELLOW SINCE HE HAD MARRIED AND LEARNED TO THINK MORE OF SOMEBODY ELSE THAN OF HIMSELF
8470-286675-0017 WHO ARE MOST UNHAPPY IN THIS WORLD THE EELS ALSO TRIED TO BE FRIENDLY AND WHEN HE DOVE TO THE BOTTOM CALLED TO HIM TO STAY AND VISIT WITH THEM YOU MUST EXCUSE US FROM MAKING THE FIRST CALL THEY SAID
8470-286675-0018 DO YOU GOOD TO GET AWAY FROM HOME MORE NO WONDER YOUR EYES ARE WEAK WHEN YOU LIE AROUND IN THE MUD OF THE DARK POND BOTTOM ALL DAY INDEED I'LL NOT STAY YOU CAN COME TO SEE ME LIKE OTHER PEOPLE
8470-286675-0019 THEN HE SWAM AWAY AND TOLD THE CLAMS WHAT HE HAD SAID
8470-286675-0020 IT'LL DO THEM GOOD TO HEAR THE TRUTH SAID HE I ALWAYS SPEAK RIGHT OUT THEY ARE AS BAD AS THE WATER ADDER THEY HAVE NO BACKBONE THE CLAMS LISTENED POLITELY AND SAID NOTHING THEY NEVER DID TALK MUCH
8470-286675-0021 THE SNAPPING TURTLE WAS MISTAKEN THOUGH WHEN HE SAID THAT THE EELS AND THE WATER ADDER HAD NO BACKBONE THEY REALLY HAD MUCH MORE THAN HE BUT THEY WORE THEIRS INSIDE WHILE HIS WAS SPREAD OUT IN THE SHAPE OF A SHELL FOR EVERYBODY TO SEE
8470-286675-0022 HE DID NOT EVEN TRY TO KEEP HIS TEMPER HE BECAME ANGRY ONE DAY BECAUSE BELOSTOMA THE GIANT WATER BUG ATE SOMETHING WHICH HE WANTED FOR HIMSELF
8470-286675-0023 YOU ARE A GOOD FOR NOTHING BUG HE SAID YOU DO NO WORK AND YOU EAT MORE THAN ANY OTHER PERSON OF YOUR SIZE HERE NOBODY LIKES YOU
8470-286675-0024 AND THERE ISN'T A LITTLE FISH IN THE POND WHO WOULD BE SEEN WITH YOU IF HE COULD HELP IT THEY ALL HIDE IF THEY SEE YOU COMING I'LL BE HEARTILY GLAD WHEN YOU GET YOUR WINGS AND FLY AWAY
8470-286675-0025 DON'T LET ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS LAY THEIR EGGS IN THIS POND I'VE SEEN ENOUGH OF YOUR FAMILY
8470-286675-0026 HE WOULD HAVE CHOSEN TO BE A CRAYFISH OR A STICKLEBACK RATHER THAN WHAT HE WAS AS FOR HIS NOT WORKING THERE WAS NOTHING FOR HIM TO DO SO HOW COULD HE WORK HE HAD TO EAT OR
8470-286675-0027 HE WOULD NOT GROW AND SINCE THE SNAPPING TURTLE WAS A HEARTY EATER HIMSELF HE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE SENSE TO KEEP STILL ABOUT THAT BELOSTOMA TOLD THE MUD TURTLES WHAT THE SNAPPING TURTLE HAD SAID
8470-286675-0028 AND THE MUD TURTLE FATHER SPOKE OF IT TO THE SNAPPING TURTLE BY THAT TIME THE SNAPPING TURTLE WAS FEELING BETTER NATURED AND WAS VERY GRACIOUS
8470-286675-0029 BUT THEN I GET RIGHT OVER IT I HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN MY LITTLE TALK WITH HIM I DON'T SEE ANY REASON FOR TELLING HIM I AM SORRY HE IS VERY SILLY TO THINK SO MUCH OF IT HE LIFTED HIS BIG HEAD QUITE HIGH
8470-286675-0030 HE MIGHT JUST AS SENSIBLY ASK PEOPLE TO ADMIRE HIM FOR NOT EATING WHEN HIS STOMACH WAS FULL
8470-286675-0031 SHE WAS QUITE OUT OF PATIENCE ALL HE CARES FOR SAID SHE IS JUST SNAPPING TURTLE SNAPPING TURTLE SNAPPING TURTLE
8470-286675-0032 WHEN HE IS GOOD NATURED HE THINKS EVERYBODY ELSE OUGHT TO BE AND WHEN HE IS BAD TEMPERED HE DOESN'T CARE HOW OTHER PEOPLE FEEL
8470-286675-0033 AND I DON'T SEE ANY CHANCE OF THAT HAPPENING THERE CAME A DAY THOUGH WHEN THE POND PEOPLE WERE GLAD THAT THE SNAPPING TURTLE LIVED THERE
8470-286675-0034 THE STICKLEBACKS TURNED PALE ALL OVER AS THEY DO WHEN THEY ARE BADLY FRIGHTENED THE YELLOW BROWN FROG WAS SO SCARED THAT HE EMPTIED OUT THE WATER HE HAD SAVED FOR WETTING HIS SKIN IN DRY WEATHER
8470-286675-0035 HE HAD A GREAT POCKET IN HIS BODY FILLED WITH WATER FOR IF HIS SKIN SHOULD GET DRY HE COULDN'T BREATHE THROUGH IT AND UNLESS HE CARRIED WATER WITH HIM HE COULD NOT STAY ASHORE AT ALL
8470-286675-0036 WAVING HIS FEET IN THE AIR BUT NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO GET RIGHT SIDE UP AGAIN THE SNAPPING TURTLE WAS TAKING A NAP IN DEEP WATER WHEN THE FRIGHTENED FISHES CAME SWIMMING TOWARD HIM AS FAST AS THEIR TAILS WOULD TAKE THEM
8470-286675-0037 WHAT IS THE MATTER SAID HE
8470-286675-0038 HUMPH SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE I'LL HAVE TO SEE ABOUT THAT HOW MANY ARE THERE
8470-286675-0039 AND THERE IS ONLY ONE OF ME SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE TO HIMSELF I MUST HAVE SOMEBODY TO HELP ME
8470-286675-0040 HELP ME DRIVE THOSE BOYS AWAY WITH PLEASURE SAID BELOSTOMA WHO LIKED NOTHING BETTER THAN THIS KIND OF WORK OFF THEY STARTED FOR THE PLACE WHERE THE BOYS WERE WADING
8470-286675-0041 JUMP ONTO MY BACK CRIED HE YOU ARE A LIGHT FELLOW HANG TIGHT BELOSTOMA JUMPED ONTO THE SNAPPING TURTLE'S CLAY COLORED SHELL
8470-286675-0042 AND WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF SLIPPING OFF THE BACK END OF IT HE STUCK HIS CLAWS INTO THE SNAPPING TURTLE'S TAIL AND HELD ON IN THAT WAY HE KNEW THAT HE WAS NOT EASILY HURT EVEN IF HE DID MAKE A FUSS WHEN HE BUMPED HIS HEAD
8470-286675-0043 AS SOON AS THEY GOT NEAR THE BOYS THE SNAPPING TURTLE SPOKE OVER HIS BACK SHELL TO BELOSTOMA SLIDE OFF NOW SAID HE AND DRIVE AWAY THE SMALLER BOY
8470-286675-0044 I'M ABOUT READY TO LEAVE THE POND I THINK I'LL GO TO MORROW GOING TO MORROW EXCLAIMED THE SNAPPING TURTLE I'M SORRY
8470-286675-0045 OF COURSE I KNOW YOU CAN NEVER COME BACK BUT SEND YOUR FRIENDS HERE TO LAY THEIR EGGS WE MUSTN'T BE LEFT WITHOUT SOME OF YOUR FAMILY THANK YOU SAID BELOSTOMA
8470-286675-0046 AND HE DID NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERED SOME QUITE DIFFERENT THINGS WHICH THE SNAPPING TURTLE HAD SAID BEFORE ABOUT HIS LEAVING THE POND
8470-286675-0047 THERE IS THE MUD TURTLE FATHER ON HIS BACK AND HE RAN TO HIM AND PUSHED HIM OVER ONTO HIS FEET
8470-286675-0048 I WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO DO THAT ALWAYS GLAD TO HELP MY NEIGHBORS SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE PLEASANT DAY ISN'T IT I MUST TELL THE FISHES THAT THE BOYS ARE GONE THE POOR LITTLE FELLOWS WERE ALMOST TOO SCARED TO SWIM
8470-286675-0049 AND HE WENT AWAY WITH A REALLY HAPPY LOOK ON HIS FACE THERE SAID THE MUD TURTLE MOTHER TO HER HUSBAND HE HAS BEGUN TO HELP PEOPLE AND NOW HE LIKES THEM AND IS CONTENTED
