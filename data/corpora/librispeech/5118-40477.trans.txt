5118-40477-0000 THERE IS SOMETHING STRANGE AND SOLEMN ABOUT AN ENGINE HOUSE AT NIGHT LIKE THE STILLNESS OF A CHURCH OR THE HUSH OF A DROWSING MENAGERIE YOU ARE FILLED WITH A SENSE OF IMPENDING DANGER
5118-40477-0001 WHICH IS SYMBOLIZED EVERYWHERE IN THE BOOTS RANGED AT BUNK SIDES OF SIGHING SLEEPERS IN THE BRASS COLUMNS SMOOTH AS GLASS THAT REACH UP THROUGH MANHOLES IN THE FLOOR
5118-40477-0002 AND AT WHICH THE FIRE CREW LEAP HALF DRUNK WITH FATIGUE IN THE ENGINE PURRING AT THE DOUBLE DOORS STEAM ALWAYS AT TWENTY FIVE IN THE BOILER WITH TONGUES AND HARNESS LIFTED FOR THE SPRING
5118-40477-0003 IN THE BIG GONG WHICH WATCHES UNDER THE CLOCK AND THE CLOCK WATCHES TOO A TIRELESS YELLOW EYE THAT SEEMS TO BE EVER SAYING SHALL I STRIKE SHALL I STRIKE AND THE CLOCK
5118-40477-0004 TICKS BACK WAIT WAIT OR NOW NOW THAT IS WHAT YOU FEEL CHIEFLY IN AN ENGINE HOUSE AT NIGHT THE INTENSE
5118-40477-0005 IT MAY BE THE DRIVER OF A CHIEF AS HAPPENED TO ME AND SEE IF HE DOESN'T WALK BACK HOME WITH A GLADDER HEART AND A BETTER OPINION OF HIS FELLOWS I FANCY SOME OF OUR REFORMERS EVEN
5118-40477-0006 MIGHT VISIT AN ENGINE HOUSE WITH PROFIT AND LEARN TO DWELL OCCASIONALLY ON THE GOOD THAT IS IN OUR CITIES AND LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT FIGHTING WITHOUT BLUSTER AND WITHOUT EVER LETTING UP
5118-40477-0007 IT WAS A TALL LOOSE JOINTED FELLOW I MET AT THE ELM STREET STATION A TYPICAL DOWN EASTER
5118-40477-0008 A DARING MAN AND FAMOUS IN HIS DASHES FROM FIRE TO FIRE OVER THE CITY IN THESE DAYS OF IDOL BREAKING IT IS GOOD TO SEE SUCH HERO WORSHIP AS ONE FINDS HERE FOR ALL MEN WHO DESERVE IT WHETHER IN HUMBLE STATION OR NEAR THE TOP
5118-40477-0009 ASLEEP NOW UP STAIRS AGAINST THE NIGHT'S EMERGENCIES ASK ANY FIREMAN IN NEW YORK TO TELL YOU ABOUT AHEARN AND YOU'LL FIND THERE IS ONE BUSINESS WHERE JEALOUSY DOESN'T RULE AHEARN
5118-40477-0010 WHY HE'S A WONDER SIR HE'S THE DANDIEST MAN SAY DID YE EVER HEAR HOW HE CRAWLED UNDER THAT BLAZING NAPHTHA TANK AND GOT A MAN OUT WHO WAS IN THERE UNCONSCIOUS THEY GAVE HIM THE BENNETT MEDAL FOR THAT
5118-40477-0011 AND D YE KNOW ABOUT THE RESCUE HE MADE UP IN WILLIAMSBRIDGE WHEN THAT BARREL OF KEROSENE EXPLODED
5118-40477-0012 THEN EACH MAN WILL TELL YOU A DIFFERENT THING THE DRIVER'S FAVORITE STORY
5118-40477-0013 WHERE NOBODY HAD ANY BUSINESS TO GO SIR THE FIRE WAS THAT FIERCE IT WAS FINE TO SEE HIS FACE LIGHT UP AS HE TOLD WHAT HIS CHIEF DID ON THIS OCCASION AND THE WHOLE QUIET ENGINE HOUSE SEEMED TO THROB WITH PRIDE
5118-40477-0014 YOU SEE HE WENT ON
5118-40477-0015 THAT HER BABY WAS IN THE BUILDING AS A MATTER OF FACT THE BABY WAS ALL RIGHT SOME NEIGHBORS HAD IT BUT THE MOTHER DIDN'T KNOW THAT AND THE CHIEF DIDN'T KNOW IT EITHER
5118-40477-0016 AND WENT IN HE GOT TO THE ROOM ALL RIGHT WHERE THE WOMAN SAID HER BABY WAS AND IT WAS LIKE A FURNACE SO HE DID THE ONLY THING A MAN CAN DO GOT DOWN LOW ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES AND WORKED ALONG TOWARD THE BED WITH HIS MOUTH AGAINST THE FLOOR SUCKING IN AIR
5118-40477-0017 HE WENT THROUGH FIRE SIR THAT NEARLY BURNED HIS HEAD OFF IT DID BURN OFF THE RIMS OF HIS EARS BUT HE GOT TO THAT BED SOMEHOW AND THEN HE FOUND HE'D DONE IT ALL FOR NOTHING THERE WASN'T ANY BABY THERE TO SAVE
5118-40477-0018 BUT THERE WAS A CHIEF TO SAVE NOW HE WAS ABOUT GONE WHEN HE GOT BACK TO THE DOOR
5118-40477-0019 AND HE WAS A PRISONER SIR A PRISONER IN A STOVE HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY STRENGTH LEFT POOR OLD CHIEF HE COULDN'T BREATHE LET ALONE BATTER DOWN DOORS AND WE'D HAD SOME CHOICE MOURNING AROUND HERE INSIDE OF A MINUTE
5118-40477-0020 TELL YE ANOTHER THING THE CHIEF DID CONTINUED THE DRIVER
5118-40477-0021 IT WAS A MIGHTY SAD CASE WE HAD THREE PEOPLE TO SAVE IF WE COULD AND TWO OF EM SICK
5118-40477-0022 ABOUT TEN FEET AWAY ALONG THE SAME WALL AND BY LEANING OUT OF OUR WINDOWS WE COULD TELL EM WHAT TO DO IT WAS A CASE OF ROPES AND SWING ACROSS TO US BUT IT ISN'T EVERY MAN CAN MAKE A ROPE FAST RIGHT WHEN A FIRE IS HURRYING HIM
5118-40477-0023 ESPECIALLY A SICK MAN OR MEBBE IT WAS A POOR ROPE HE HAD ANYHOW WHEN THE NURSE CAME OUT OF THAT WINDOW YOU MIGHT SAY TUMBLED OUT YOU SEE THEY MADE HER GO FIRST
5118-40477-0024 AND WHEN THE ROPE TIGHTENED IT SNAPPED AND DOWN SHE WENT SEVEN STORIES KILLED HER BANG THE CHIEF SAW THAT WOULD NEVER DO SO WE WENT UP ON THE ROOF AND THREW OVER MORE ROPE
5118-40477-0025 IT WAS CLOTHES LINE THE ONLY THING HANDY BUT I DOUBLED IT TO MAKE SURE AND WITH THAT WE GOT THE HUSBAND AND WIFE ACROSS ALL SAFE FOR NOW YOU SEE WE COULD LIFT EM OUT EASY WITHOUT SUCH A TERRIBLE JERK ON THE ROPE
5118-40477-0026 THAT WAS THE CHIEF'S IDEA YES SAID I BUT YOU HELPED WHAT'S YOUR NAME
5118-40477-0027 NEVER MIND ME I'M NOBODY LET THE CHIEF HAVE IT ALL AND THEN HE WENT ON WITH THE STORY WHICH INTERESTED ME MAINLY AS SHOWING THE KIND OF LOYALTY ONE FINDS AMONG THESE FIREMEN EACH MAN WILL TELL OF ANOTHER MAN'S ACHIEVEMENTS NOT OF HIS OWN
5118-40477-0028 YOU COULD NEVER FIND OUT WHAT BILL BROWN DID FROM BROWN HIMSELF THE CLOCK TICKED ON SOME SERVICE CALLS RANG ON THE TELEPHONE
5118-40477-0029 COUNTING THE STROKES OF THE GONG NO IT WASN'T FOR THEM THEY'D GO THOUGH ON THE SECOND CALL SECOND CALLS USUALLY CAME WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES OF THE FIRST SO WE'D SOON SEE MEANTIME
5118-40477-0030 HE TOLD ME ABOUT A FIREMAN KNOWN AS CRAZY BANTA TALK ABOUT DAREDEVILS SAID HE THIS MAN BANTA BEAT THE TOWN
5118-40477-0031 A HOUSE WITH A LINE OF MEN WHERE THEY HAD TO CROSS THE RIDGE OF A SLATE ROOF YOU KNOW WHERE THE TWO SIDES SLANT UP TO A POINT WELL THE OTHER MEN WOULD STRADDLE ALONG CAREFUL ONE LEG ON EACH SIDE BUT WHEN BANTA CAME
5118-40477-0032 HE'D WALK ACROSS STRAIGHT UP JUST LIKE HE WAS DOWN ON THE STREET THAT'S WHY WE CALLED HIM CRAZY' HE'D DO SUCH CRAZY THINGS AND FUNNY WELL SIR HE'D SWALLER QUARTERS AS FAST AS YOU'D GIVE EM TO HIM
5118-40477-0033 AND LET YOU PUNCH HIM IN THE STOMACH AND HEAR EM RATTLE AROUND THEN HE'D LIGHT A MATCH

5118-40477-0035 THEY SAID HE'D PROB'LY TRAVELED WITH SOME SHOW
5118-40477-0036 SO ONE DAY A BATTALION CHIEF CALLED HIS BLUFF

5118-40477-0039 AND ONE OF THE BOYS DAVE SODEN GOT WEDGED UNDER THE SECOND FLOOR WITH ALL THE OTHER FLOORS PILED ON TOP OF HIM IT WAS A GREAT BIG CRISS CROSS OF TIMBERS WITH DAVE AT THE BOTTOM
5118-40477-0040 AND WE COULDN'T BEGIN AT THE TOP AND THROW OFF THE TIMBERS FOR THERE WASN'T ANY TIME WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BUT BANTA HE DID HE GRABBED UP A SAW AND SAID HE'D CRAWL IN AND GET DAVE OUT
