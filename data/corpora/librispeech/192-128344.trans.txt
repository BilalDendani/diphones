192-128344-0010 TO SO UNHAPPY A BEGINNING BE COMFORTED AND FORGIVE ME HEAVEN BLESS YOU AS HE WAS DRAWN AWAY HIS WIFE RELEASED HIM AND STOOD LOOKING AFTER HIM WITH HER HANDS TOUCHING ONE ANOTHER IN THE ATTITUDE OF PRAYER
192-128344-0011 AND WITH A RADIANT LOOK UPON HER FACE IN WHICH THERE WAS EVEN A COMFORTING SMILE AS HE WENT OUT AT THE PRISONERS DOOR SHE TURNED LAID HER HEAD LOVINGLY ON HER FATHER'S BREAST TRIED TO SPEAK TO HIM AND FELL AT HIS FEET
