7932-110056-0000 PART TWO OF PROPRIETY OF DEPORTMENT IN REGARD TO OUR SOCIAL RELATIONS CHAPTER ONE OF DEPORTMENT IN THE STREET SOME READERS WILL PERHAPS BE SURPRISED TO SEE ME COMMENCE A CHAPTER WITH THE DUTY WE OWE TO PERSONS PASSING THE STREET
7932-110056-0001 BUT IF THEY REFLECT UPON IT THEY WILL SEE THAT THERE ARE EVEN ON THIS SUBJECT A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF THINGS PROPER TO BE MENTIONED WHEN YOU ARE PASSING IN THE STREET AND SEE COMING TOWARDS YOU A PERSON OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WHETHER A LADY A MAN RAISED TO DIGNITY OR AN ELDERLY PERSON
7932-110056-0002 BEWARE OF ELBOWING AND RUDELY CROWDING THE PASSENGERS WITH A VIEW TO GETTING BY MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY WAIT YOUR TURN AND IF ANY ONE OF THE PERSONS BEFORE MENTIONED COMES UP YOU SHOULD EDGE UP TO THE WALL IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM THE PLACE
7932-110056-0003 THEY ALSO AS THEY PASS OUGHT TO BOW POLITELY TO YOU IF STORMY WEATHER HAS MADE IT NECESSARY TO LAY A PLANK ACROSS THE GUTTERS WHICH HAVE BECOME SUDDENLY FULL OF WATER IT IS NOT PROPER TO CROWD BEFORE ANOTHER IN ORDER TO PASS OVER THE FRAIL BRIDGE
7932-110056-0004 FURTHER A YOUNG MAN OF GOOD BREEDING SHOULD PROMPTLY OFFER HIS HAND TO LADIES EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT ACQUAINTANCES WHEN THEY PASS SUCH A PLACE YOU MUST PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR MANNER OF WALKING
7932-110056-0005 FOR FEAR OF THROWING MUD AROUND YOU AND SPATTERING YOURSELF AS WELL AS THOSE WHO ACCOMPANY YOU OR WHO WALK BEHIND YOU ANY PERSON PARTICULARLY A LADY WHO WALKS IN THIS IMPROPER MANNER WHATEVER HER EDUCATION MAY BE IN OTHER RESPECTS
7932-110056-0006 WILL ALWAYS APPEAR AWKWARD AND CLUMSY
7932-110056-0007 WE SEE THEM IN WHITE STOCKINGS AND THIN SHOES PASSING THROUGH LONG DIRTY AND BLOCKED UP STREETS GLIDING BY CARELESS PERSONS AND BY VEHICLES CROSSING EACH OTHER IN EVERY DIRECTION
7932-110056-0008 AND YET RETURN HOME AFTER A WALK OF SEVERAL HOURS WITHOUT SOILING THEIR CLOTHES IN THE LEAST TO ARRIVE AT THIS ASTONISHING RESULT WHICH CAUSES THE WONDER AND VEXATION OF PROVINCIAL VISITORS ON THEIR FIRST COMING TO PARIS
7932-110056-0009 WE MUST BE CAREFUL TO PUT THE FOOT ON THE MIDDLE OF THE PAVING STONES AND NEVER ON THE EDGES FOR IN THAT CASE ONE INEVITABLY SLIPS INTO THE INTERSTICE BETWEEN ONE PAVEMENT AND ANOTHER WE MUST BEGIN BY SUPPORTING THE TOE BEFORE WE DO THE HEEL
7932-110056-0010 AND EVEN WHEN THE MUD IS QUITE DEEP WE MUST PUT DOWN THE HEEL BUT SELDOM WHEN THE STREET BECOMES LESS MUDDY WE CAN COMPENSATE OURSELVES FOR THIS FATIGUE WHICH HOWEVER IN THE END LEAVES US HARDLY SENSIBLE
7932-110056-0011 THIS MANNER OF WALKING IS STRICTLY NECESSARY WHEN YOU OFFER YOUR ARM TO ANY ONE WHEN TRIPPING OVER THE PAVEMENT AS THE SAYING IS A LADY SHOULD GRACEFULLY RAISE HER DRESS A LITTLE ABOVE HER ANCLE WITH THE RIGHT HAND SHE SHOULD HOLD TOGETHER THE FOLDS OF HER GOWN
7932-110056-0012 AND DRAW THEM TOWARDS THE RIGHT SIDE TO RAISE THE DRESS ON BOTH SIDES AND WITH BOTH HANDS IS VULGAR THIS UNGRACEFUL PRACTICE CAN BE TOLERATED ONLY FOR A MOMENT WHEN THE MUD IS VERY DEEP
7932-110056-0013 THAT IS TO AVOID JOSTLING AND BEING JOSTLED BY THOSE WHO ARE PASSING A NEGLECT OF THIS ATTENTION WILL MAKE YOU APPEAR NOT ONLY AWKWARD AND RIDICULOUS BUT YOU WILL RECEIVE OR GIVE DANGEROUS BLOWS ONE CAN EDGE ALONG BY TURNING SIDEWAYS CONTRACTING HIS ARMS
7932-110056-0014 AND WATCHING WITH HIS EYE THE DIRECTION WHICH IT IS BEST TO TAKE IN ORDER NOT TO COME IN CONTACT WITH THE PERSON WHO MEETS HIM A LITTLE PRACTICE AND CARE WILL SOON MAKE THIS DUTY FAMILIAR
7932-110056-0015 TO MAKE OUR WAY ALONG BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT WHEN WE HAVE A PACKET OR AN UMBRELLA TO CARRY ESPECIALLY IF THE LATTER IS OPEN IT IS THEN NECESSARY TO LOWER OR RAISE IT OR TO TURN IT ON ONE SIDE
7932-110056-0016 IF YOU NEGLECT THESE PRECAUTIONS YOU RUN THE RISK OF STRIKING IT AGAINST THOSE WHO ARE COMING AND GOING OR OF SEEING IT TWIRLED ROUND AND OF BEING THROWN AGAINST A CARRIAGE OR AGAINST SOME ONE WHO WILL COMPLAIN BITTERLY OF YOUR INCIVILITY AND AWKWARDNESS
7932-110056-0017 IF YOU HAVE NO UMBRELLA AND FIND YOURSELF OVERTAKEN BY A SUDDEN SHOWER AND ANY PERSON PROVIDED WITH ONE IS GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION YOU MAY REQUEST THEM TO SHELTER YOU THEY SHOULD RECEIVE YOUR REQUEST WITH MUCH POLITENESS INFORM THEMSELVES OF THE PLACE WHERE YOU WISH TO STOP
7932-110056-0018 AND OFFER TO CONDUCT YOU THERE UNLESS IT IS TOO MUCH OUT OF THE WAY OR THEY BE PRESSED FOR BUSINESS IN THIS CASE THEY SHOULD EXPRESS THEIR REGRET AT NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCOMPANY YOU SO FAR AS YOU WISH WHAT WE ARE NOW ABOUT TO SAY PROVES THAT A PERSON TRULY POLITE
7932-110056-0019 WILL NOT WAIT FOR YOU TO MAKE THIS REQUEST BUT WILL USE EVERY EXERTION TO ANTICIPATE IT WE MUST OBSERVE HOWEVER WHETHER AGE SEX OR DRESS PRESENT NO OBJECTION FOR SOMETIMES ONE WOULD BE TREATED WITH ILL HUMOR AND CONTEMPT
7932-110056-0020 AND IF YOU ARE A LADY PARTICULARLY ARRIVED AT A CERTAIN AGE IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY UNPLEASANT TO ACCOST A PERSON WHO ON HIS PART OUGHT NEVER TO OFFER THIS FAVOR NOR ANY OTHER TO LADIES AND WHOSE AIR AND IMMODEST MANNERS INDICATE AT ONCE HIS VULGARITY
7932-110056-0021 IT IS PROPER TO RECEIVE IT WITH POLITENESS ANOTHER NOT UNCOMMON POINT OF PROPRIETY TO BE OBSERVED CONSISTS IN ASKING AND POINTING OUT THE DIFFERENT STREETS IF YOU HAVE OCCASION FOR THIS SERVICE YOU SPEAK POLITELY
7932-110056-0022 AND SAY IN A KIND TONE MADAM OR SIR WHERE IS SUCH A STREET IF YOU PLEASE YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL TO GIVE THIS TITLE TO PERSONS WHOM YOU ADDRESS EVEN IF THEY SHOULD BE PORTERS OR HUCKSTERS IT IS PARTICULARLY TO THESE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE RECOURSE FOR IN ADDRESSING PERSONS PASSING BY
7932-110056-0023 YOU ARE LIABLE TO MEET THOSE WHO AS WELL AS YOURSELF ARE STRANGERS TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD OR TO HINDER THOSE WHO ARE BUSY
7932-110056-0024 THE DIRECTION BEING GIVEN US WE SHOULD THANK THEM AT THE SAME TIME BOWING PARISIANS ARE JUSTLY CELEBRATED FOR THE POLITENESS AND COMPLAISANCE WITH WHICH THEY SHOW THE WAY TO PASSENGERS AND YOU OUGHT TO IMITATE THEM EVERY TIME THAT OCCASION OFFERS
7932-110056-0025 IF YOU ARE A MAN AND A LADY OR DISTINGUISHED PERSON ASKS THIS FAVOR OF YOU YOU SHOULD TAKE OFF YOUR HAT WHILE ANSWERING THEM THERE ARE SOME ILL MANNERED AND MALICIOUS PERSONS WHO TAKE PLEASURE IN MISLEADING STRANGERS BY WRONG DIRECTIONS
7932-110056-0026 IT WILL BE ENOUGH TO MENTION SUCH IMPERTINENCE IN ORDER TO DESPISE IT AS WE OUGHT AS TO THOSE YOUNG MEN WHO ENTERTAIN A FALSE IDEA THAT PARISIAN LADIES ARE COQUETTES OR FORWARD IN THEIR MANNERS AND BESIDES THAT EVERYTHING IS ALLOWABLE IN A LARGE CITY
7932-110056-0027 LET THEM BE ASSURED THAT A MAN WHO DARES AS OFTEN HAPPENS TO ADDRESS IMPROPER COMPLIMENTS TO LADIES TO FOLLOW THEM TO LISTEN TO THEIR CONVERSATION OR TO FINISH A SENTENCE WHICH THEY HAVE BEGUN
7932-110056-0028 IS A MODEL OF RUDENESS AN OBJECT OF AVERSION TO LADIES AND OF CONTEMPT TO GENTLEMEN A YOUNG MAN OF GOOD MANNERS OUGHT NOT TO LOOK AT A LADY TOO NARROWLY OR HE WILL PASS FOR AN IMPERTINENT FELLOW WHO AS THE SAYING IS
7932-110056-0029 STARES PEOPLE FULL IN THE FACE SOUS LE NEZ IT IS ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE MANY PERSONS ASSEMBLED IN ONE PLACE THAT THESE BOORS PLAY OFF THEIR RUDE TRICKS TO WHICH THEY GIVE THE NAME HOAXES FOR THE MULTITUDE AT FIRST BECAUSE THEY ARE UNPERCEIVED AND AFTERWARDS
7932-110056-0030 BECAUSE THE LEAST BAD AMONG THEM THINK THAT THE CROWD ARE OUT OF THE JURISDICTION OF PROPRIETY THIS OPINION WHICH OBTAINS AMONG SOME PERSONS IS AN ERROR POLITENESS BECOMES STILL MORE INDISPENSABLE IN PROPORTION TO THE ASSEMBLAGE
7932-110056-0031 WHY ARE CROWDS USUALLY SO DISAGREEABLE AND EVEN DANGEROUS IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPOSED OF PEOPLE WITHOUT EDUCATION WHO RUDELY PUSH AGAINST THEIR NEIGHBORS WITH THEIR FIST OR ELBOW WHO NEGLECT TO FOLLOW THE MOVEMENT OF GOING AND COMING
7932-110056-0032 WHO ON OCCASION OF THE SLIGHTEST COLLISION RAISE LOUD COMPLAINTS AND BY THEIR LAMENTATIONS THEIR CRIES AND CONTINUAL TREPIDATION RENDER INSUPPORTABLE A SITUATION WHICH WITHOUT THIS WOULD BE BUT TROUBLESOME ENOUGH WHEN WE MEET IN THE STREET A PERSON OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE
7932-110056-0033 WE SALUTE THEM BY BOWING AND UNCOVERING OURSELVES IF THERE IS OCCASION SOMETIMES IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO GIVE A SIMPLE SALUTATION BUT WE MUST GO TO THE PERSON AND INQUIRE HOW THEY ARE IF WE SEE THEM FREQUENTLY WHILE WE ARE SPEAKING IF THERE IS OCCASION AND IT BE A LADY OR AN AGED AND RESPECTABLE MAN
7932-110056-0034 WE REMAIN UNCOVERED IT IS FOR THE LATTER WHO SEE HOW TROUBLESOME THIS POLITENESS IS IN WINTER TO INSIST THAT THE PERSON ADDRESSING THEM SHOULD PUT ON HIS HAT IT ALSO BELONGS TO THE PERSON WHO IS THE MORE IMPORTANT OF THE TWO TO TAKE LEAVE FIRST FOR EXAMPLE
7932-110056-0035 IN A MEETING OF THIS KIND A GENTLEMAN NEVER LEAVES A LADY UNTIL SHE TAKES LEAVE OF HIM NOR IS A YOUNG LADY ALLOWED TO LEAVE FIRST A MARRIED OR ELDERLY LADY DURING THIS INTERVIEW WHICH SHOULD BE VERY SHORT
7932-110056-0036 THE SPEAKER OF LEAST IMPORTANCE OUGHT TO TAKE THE LOWER PART OF THE SIDE WALK IN ORDER TO KEEP THE PERSON WITH WHOM HE IS CONVERSING FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CARRIAGES IT WOULD BE SUPREMELY RIDICULOUS TO ENTER INTO A LONG CONVERSATION AND THUS DETAIN AGAINST THEIR WILL THE PERSON ACCOSTED
7932-110056-0037 IF WE HAVE ANYTHING URGENT TO SAY TO THEM WE MAY ASK PERMISSION TO ACCOMPANY THEM WE WILL ADD THAT AT PARIS A YOUNG MAN OUGHT TO AVOID APPROACHING AND EVEN SALUTING A YOUNG LADY OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE OUT OF REGARD TO THE NATURAL TIMIDITY OF HER SEX
7932-110056-0038 IF THERE IS A STRANGER WITH THE ONE WHOM WE MEET WE MUST BE CONTENTED WITH SALUTING THE LATTER WITHOUT STOPPING OTHERWISE WE PUT HIS COMPANION IN A DISAGREEABLE POSITION THIS CIVILITY BECOMES A RIGOROUS DUTY IF THEY ARE ACCOMPANIED BY A LADY
7932-110056-0039 ANCIENT GALLANTRY REQUIRED THAT IN THIS LAST CASE WE NOT ONLY SHOULD NOT STOP BUT STILL MORE THAT WE SHOULD NOT SALUTE AN ACQUAINTANCE OR FRIEND WHO MAY PASS THIS IS IN ORDER NOT TO FORCE HER COMPANION TO SALUTE AN UNKNOWN PERSON
7932-110056-0040 IT IS NECESSARY TO SALUTE THEM SAYING TO THE COMPANION I TAKE THE LIBERTY TO SALUTE MISTER OR MADAM N IF A PERSON OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE IS AT A WINDOW AND YOU ARE THOUGHT TO PERCEIVE THEM YOU OUGHT TO ADDRESS A SALUTATION TO THEM
