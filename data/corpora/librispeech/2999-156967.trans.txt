2999-156967-0001 WHEN JEHOVAH SAW THAT THE WICKEDNESS OF MAN WAS GREAT IN THE EARTH AND THAT EVERY PURPOSE IN THE THOUGHTS OF HIS HEART WAS ONLY EVIL CONTINUALLY IT WAS A SOURCE OF REGRET THAT HE HAD MADE MAN ON THE EARTH AND IT GRIEVED HIM TO HIS HEART
2999-156967-0002 THEREFORE JEHOVAH SAID I WILL DESTROY FROM THE FACE OF THE GROUND MAN WHOM I HAVE CREATED FOR I REGRET THAT I HAVE MADE MANKIND THEN JEHOVAH SAID TO NOAH
2999-156967-0003 AND NOAH ONLY WAS LEFT AND THEY WHO WERE WITH HIM IN THE ARK
2999-156967-0004 AND WITHOUT FAITH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE WELL PLEASING WITH GOD FOR HE THAT COMETH TO GOD MUST BELIEVE THAT HE IS AND THAT HE IS A REWARDER OF THEM THAT SEEK AFTER HIM
2999-156967-0005 NOAH BEING WARNED OF GOD CONCERNING THINGS NOT SEEN AS YET MOVED WITH GODLY FEAR PREPARED AN ARK TO THE SAVING OF HIS HOUSE THROUGH WHICH HE CONDEMNED THE WORLD AND BECAME HEIR OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH IS ACCORDING TO FAITH
2999-156967-0006 RARE IS THE MAN WHO CAN LOOK BACK OVER HIS LIFE AND NOT CONFESS AT LEAST TO HIMSELF THAT THE THINGS WHICH HAVE MADE HIM MOST A MAN ARE THE VERY THINGS FROM WHICH HE TRIED WITH ALL HIS SOUL TO ESCAPE
2999-156967-0007 IF WE WOULD ATTAIN HAPPINESS WE MUST FIRST ATTAIN HELPFULNESS BUT STAY NO AGE WAS E'ER DEGENERATE UNLESS MEN HELD IT AT TOO CHEAP A RATE FOR IN OUR LIKENESS STILL WE SHAPE OUR FATE LOWELL
2999-156967-0008 THE TWO BIBLICAL ACCOUNTS OF THE FLOOD
2999-156967-0009 HAVE LONG RECOGNIZED CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES IN INTERPRETING THE NARRATIVE AS IT NOW STANDS THUS FOR EXAMPLE
2999-156967-0010 NOAH IS COMMANDED TO TAKE INTO THE ARK TWO OF EVERY KIND OF BEAST AND BIRD
2999-156967-0011 THREE HE IS COMMANDED TO TAKE IN SEVEN OF ALL THE CLEAN BEASTS AND BIRDS
2999-156967-0012 THE FLOOD CAME AS THE RESULT OF A FORTY DAYS RAIN
2999-156967-0013 THE FLOOD CONTINUED ON THE EARTH FORTY DAYS
2999-156967-0014 ITS DURATION WAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAYS THESE
2999-156967-0015 POINT SOME WRITERS THINK TO TWO ORIGINALLY DISTINCT ACCOUNTS OF THE FLOOD WHICH HAVE BEEN CLOSELY WOVEN TOGETHER BY THE FINAL EDITOR OF THE BOOK OF GENESIS WHEN THESE TWO ACCOUNTS ARE DISENTANGLED THEY ARE EACH PRACTICALLY COMPLETE
2999-156967-0016 AND APPARENTLY REPRESENT VARIANT VERSIONS OF THE SAME FLOOD STORY
2999-156967-0017 IT HAS THE FLOWING VIVID PICTURESQUE LITERARY STYLE AND THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE PROPHETIC TEACHER IN THIS ACCOUNT THE NUMBER SEVEN PREVAILS SEVEN OF EACH CLEAN BEAST AND BIRD ARE TAKEN INTO THE ARK TO PROVIDE FOOD FOR NOAH AND HIS FAMILY
2999-156967-0018 SEVEN DAYS THE WATERS ROSE AND AT INTERVALS OF SEVEN DAYS HE SENT OUT A RAVEN AND A DOVE THE FLOOD FROM ITS BEGINNING TO THE TIME WHEN NOAH DISEMBARKED CONTINUED SIXTY EIGHT DAYS
2999-156967-0019 AT THE END WHEN HE HAD DETERMINED BY SENDING OUT BIRDS THAT THE WATERS HAD SUBSIDED HE WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK AND REARED AN ALTAR AND OFFERED SACRIFICE TO JEHOVAH OF EVERY CLEAN BEAST AND BIRD
2999-156967-0020 THE OTHER AND MORE DETAILED ACCOUNT IS APPARENTLY THE SEQUEL OF THE LATE PRIESTLY NARRATIVES FOUND IN GENESIS ONE AND FIVE THE STYLE IS THAT OF A LEGAL WRITER FORMAL EXACT AND REPETITIOUS
2999-156967-0021 IN THIS ACCOUNT ONLY TWO OF EACH KIND OF BEAST AND BIRD ARE TAKEN INTO THE ARK THE FLOOD LASTS FOR OVER A YEAR AND IS UNIVERSAL COVERING EVEN THE TOPS OF THE HIGHEST MOUNTAINS NO ANIMALS ARE SACRIFICED FOR ACCORDING TO THE PRIESTLY WRITER
2999-156967-0022 THIS CUSTOM WAS FIRST INSTITUTED BY MOSES WHEN THE FLOOD SUBSIDES HOWEVER A COVENANT IS CONCLUDED AND IS SEALED BY THE RAINBOW IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHICH MAN'S COMMISSION TO RULE OVER ALL OTHER LIVING THINGS IS RENEWED
2999-156967-0023 PROVIDED ONLY THAT MEN CAREFULLY ABSTAIN FROM EATING THE BLOOD THIS LATER ACCOUNT IS DATED BY THIS GROUP OF MODERN BIBLICAL SCHOLARS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED B C TWO THE CORRESPONDING BABYLONIAN FLOOD STORIES
2999-156967-0024 CLOSELY PARALLEL TO THESE TWO VARIANT BIBLICAL ACCOUNTS OF THE FLOOD ARE THE TWO BABYLONIAN VERSIONS WHICH HAVE FORTUNATELY BEEN ALMOST WHOLLY RECOVERED THE OLDER BABYLONIAN ACCOUNT IS FOUND IN THE ELEVENTH TABLET OF THE GILGAMESH EPIC
2999-156967-0025 THIS GREAT CONQUEROR LIVED CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH MANASSEH DURING WHOSE REIGN ASSYRIAN INFLUENCE WAS PARAMOUNT IN THE KINGDOM OF JUDAH IN HIS QUEST FOR HEALING AND IMMORTALITY
2999-156967-0026 GILGAMESH REACHED THE ABODE OF THE BABYLONIAN HERO OF THE FLOOD IN RESPONSE TO GILGAMESH'S QUESTION AS TO HOW HE A MORTAL ATTAINED IMMORTALITY THE BABYLONIAN NOAH RECOUNTS THE STORY OF THE FLOOD
2999-156967-0027 IT WAS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE BABYLONIAN GODS IN ORDER TO DESTROY THE CITY OF SHURIPPAK SITUATED ON THE BANKS OF THE EUPHRATES THE GOD
2999-156967-0028 GAVE THE WARNING TO HIS WORSHIPPER THE HERO OF THE FLOOD AND COMMANDED HIM CONSTRUCT A HOUSE BUILD A SHIP LEAVE GOODS LOOK AFTER LIFE FORSAKE POSSESSIONS AND SAVE LIFE
2999-156967-0029 CAUSE ALL KINDS OF LIVING THINGS TO GO UP INTO THE SHIP THE SHIP WHICH THOU SHALT BUILD EXACT SHALL BE ITS DIMENSIONS ITS BREADTH SHALL EQUAL ITS LENGTH ON THE GREAT DEEP LAUNCH IT
2999-156967-0030 MY LORD BEHOLD MY LORD WHAT THOU HAST COMMANDED I HAVE REVERENTLY RECEIVED AND WILL CARRY OUT A DETAILED ACCOUNT THEN FOLLOWS OF THE BUILDING OF THE ARK
2999-156967-0031 ITS DIMENSIONS WERE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY CUBITS IN EACH DIRECTION IT WAS BUILT IN SIX STORIES EACH OF WHICH WAS DIVIDED INTO NINE PARTS PLENTIFUL PROVISIONS WERE NEXT CARRIED ON BOARD
2999-156967-0032 AND A GREAT FEAST WAS HELD TO COMMEMORATE THE COMPLETION OF THE ARK AFTER CARRYING ON BOARD HIS TREASURES OF SILVER AND GOLD HE ADDS ALL THE LIVING CREATURES OF ALL KINDS I LOADED ON IT I BROUGHT ON BOARD MY FAMILY AND HOUSEHOLD
2999-156967-0033 CATTLE OF THE FIELD BEASTS OF THE FIELD THE CRAFTSMEN ALL OF THEM I BROUGHT ON BOARD IN THE EVENING AT THE COMMAND OF THE GOD SHAMASH THE RAINS BEGAN TO DESCEND
2999-156967-0034 THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TEMPEST THAT FOLLOWS IS EXCEEDINGLY VIVID AND PICTURESQUE WHEN THE FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN SHONE FORTH THERE ROSE FROM THE HORIZON A DARK CLOUD WITHIN WHICH ADAD THUNDERED
2999-156967-0035 NABU AND MARDUK MARCHED AT THE FRONT THE HERALDS PASSED OVER MOUNTAINS AND LAND NERGAL TORE OUT THE SHIP'S MAST NINIB ADVANCED FOLLOWING UP THE ATTACK THE SPIRITS OF EARTH RAISED TORCHES
2999-156967-0036 WITH THEIR SHEEN THEY LIGHTED UP THE WORLD ADAD'S TEMPEST REACHED TO HEAVEN AND ALL LIGHT WAS CHANGED TO DARKNESS SO GREAT WAS THE HAVOC WROUGHT BY THE STORM THAT THE GODS BOWED DOWN SAT THERE WEEPING
2999-156967-0037 CLOSE PRESSED TOGETHER WERE THEIR LIPS FOR SIX DAYS AND NIGHTS THE STORM RAGED BUT ON THE SEVENTH DAY IT SUBSIDED AND THE FLOOD BEGAN TO ABATE OF THE RACE OF MORTALS HOWEVER EVERY VOICE WAS HUSHED
2999-156967-0038 WHICH LAY ON THE NORTHERN HORIZON AS VIEWED FROM THE TIGRIS EUPHRATES VALLEY HERE THE SHIP GROUNDED THEN WHEN THE SEVENTH DAY ARRIVED I SENT FORTH A DOVE AND LET IT LOOSE
2999-156967-0039 THE DOVE WENT FORTH BUT CAME BACK BECAUSE IT FOUND NO RESTING PLACE IT RETURNED
2999-156967-0040 BUT IT CAME BACK BECAUSE IT FOUND NO RESTING PLACE IT RETURNED THEN I SENT FORTH A RAVEN AND LET IT LOOSE THE RAVEN WENT FORTH AND SAW THAT THE WATERS HAD DECREASED IT FED IT WADED IT CROAKED
2999-156967-0041 BUT DID NOT RETURN THEN I SENT FORTH EVERYTHING IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND OFFERED A SACRIFICE I MADE AN OFFERING OF INCENSE ON THE HIGHEST PEAK OF THE MOUNTAIN SEVEN AND SEVEN BOWLS I PLACED THERE AND OVER THEM
2999-156967-0042 I POURED OUT CALAMUS CEDAR WOOD AND FRAGRANT HERBS THE GODS INHALED THE ODOR THE GODS INHALED THE SWEET ODOR THE GODS GATHERED LIKE FLIES ABOVE THE SACRIFICE
2999-156967-0043 THE BABYLONIAN NOAH AND HIS WIFE WERE GRANTED IMMORTALITY AND PERMITTED TO DWELL IN THE DISTANCE AT THE CONFLUENCE OF THE STREAMS A LATER VERSION OF THE SAME BABYLONIAN FLOOD STORY
2999-156967-0044 THE HERO WHO LIKE NOAH IN THE PRIESTLY ACCOUNT WAS THE LAST OF THE TEN ANCIENT BABYLONIAN KINGS AT THE COMMAND OF THE GOD HE BUILT A GREAT SHIP FIFTEEN STADIA LONG AND TWO IN WIDTH
2999-156967-0045 WHICH RETURNED WITH MUD ON ITS FEET WHEN THE THIRD BIRD FAILED TO RETURN HE TOOK OFF THE COVER OF THE SHIP AND FOUND THAT IT HAD STRANDED ON A MOUNTAIN OF ARMENIA THE MOUNTAIN IN THE BIBLICAL ACCOUNT
2999-156967-0046 IS IDENTIFIED WITH MOUNT ARARAT DISEMBARKING THE BABYLONIAN NOAH KISSED THE EARTH AND AFTER BUILDING AN ALTAR OFFERED A SACRIFICE TO THE GODS THUS THE VARIATIONS BETWEEN THE OLDER AND LATER BABYLONIAN ACCOUNTS OF THE FLOOD
2999-156967-0047 CORRESPOND IN GENERAL TO THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN ALREADY NOTED IN THE BIBLICAL VERSIONS WHICH BIBLICAL ACCOUNT DOES THE EARLIEST BABYLONIAN NARRATIVE RESEMBLE MOST CLOSELY IN WHAT DETAILS DO THEY AGREE
2999-156967-0048 WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE POINTS OF AGREEMENT THREE HISTORY OF THE BIBLICAL FLOOD STORIES ON THE BASIS OF THE PRECEDING COMPARISONS SOME WRITERS ATTEMPT TO TRACE TENTATIVELY
2999-156967-0049 THE HISTORY OF THE FLOOD TRADITION CURRENT AMONG THE PEOPLES OF SOUTHWESTERN ASIA A FRAGMENT OF THE BABYLONIAN FLOOD STORY COMING FROM AT LEAST AS EARLY AS TWO THOUSAND B C HAS RECENTLY BEEN DISCOVERED THE PROBABILITY IS
2999-156967-0050 THAT THE TRADITION GOES BACK TO THE EARLIEST BEGINNINGS OF BABYLONIAN HISTORY THE SETTING OF THE BIBLICAL ACCOUNTS OF THE FLOOD IS ALSO THE TIGRIS EUPHRATES VALLEY RATHER THAN PALESTINE
2999-156967-0051 IS NOT ONLY CLOSELY PARALLEL TO THAT FOUND IN THE BABYLONIAN ACCOUNT BUT THE METHOD THE SMEARING OF THE ARK WITHIN AND WITHOUT WITH BITUMEN IS PECULIAR TO THE TIGRIS EUPHRATES VALLEY MANY SCHOLARS BELIEVE THEREFORE
2999-156967-0052 THAT BABYLONIA WAS THE ORIGINAL HOME OF THE BIBLICAL FLOOD STORY ITS EXACT ORIGIN HOWEVER IS NOT SO CERTAIN MANY OF ITS DETAILS WERE DOUBTLESS SUGGESTED
2999-156967-0053 BY THE ANNUAL FLOODS AND FOGS WHICH INUNDATE THAT FAMOUS VALLEY AND RECALL THE PRIMEVAL CHAOS SO VIVIDLY PICTURED IN THE CORRESPONDING BABYLONIAN STORY OF THE CREATION IT MAY HAVE BEEN BASED
2999-156967-0054 ON THE REMEMBRANCES OF A GREAT LOCAL INUNDATION POSSIBLY DUE TO THE SUBSIDENCE OF GREAT AREAS OF LAND IN THE EARLIEST HEBREW RECORDS THERE IS NO TRACE OF THIS TRADITION
2999-156967-0055 ALTHOUGH IT MAY HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO THE ARAMEAN ANCESTORS OF THE HEBREWS THE LITERARY EVIDENCE HOWEVER SUGGESTS THAT IT WAS FIRST BROUGHT TO PALESTINE BY THE ASSYRIANS DURING THE REACTIONARY REIGN OF MANASSEH
2999-156967-0056 WHICH THESE CONQUERORS HAD INHERITED INUNDATED JUDAH EVEN IN THE TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM THE BABYLONIANS GODS THE HOST OF HEAVEN WERE WORSHIPPED BY CERTAIN OF THE HEBREWS THE FEW LITERARY INSCRIPTIONS WHICH COME FROM THIS PERIOD
2999-156967-0057 AND CONTAIN THE NAMES OF ASSYRIAN OFFICIALS LATER WHEN THE JEWISH EXILES WERE CARRIED TO BABYLONIA THEY NATURALLY CAME INTO CONTACT AGAIN WITH THE BABYLONIAN ACCOUNT OF THE FLOOD BUT IN ITS LATER FORM
2999-156967-0058 AS THE COMPARISONS ALREADY INSTITUTED CLEARLY INDICATE IT IS THUS POSSIBLE THESE SCHOLARS BELIEVE
