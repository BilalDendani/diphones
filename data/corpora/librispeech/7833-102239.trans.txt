7833-102239-0000 MISTER LINCOLN HAD MADE THUS FAR VERY LITTLE MONEY NOTHING MORE IN FACT THAN A SUBSISTENCE OF THE MOST MODEST CHARACTER BUT HE HAD MADE SOME WARM FRIENDS AND THIS MEANT MUCH AMONG THE EARLY ILLINOISANS
7833-102239-0001 HE HAD BECOME INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED AT VANDALIA WITH WILLIAM BUTLER WHO WAS GREATLY INTERESTED IN THE REMOVAL OF THE CAPITAL TO SPRINGFIELD AND WHO URGED THE YOUNG LEGISLATOR
7833-102239-0002 OF WHOM SEVENTY EIGHT WERE FREE NEGROES TWENTY REGISTERED INDENTURED SERVANTS AND SIX SLAVES SCARCELY A PERCEPTIBLE TRACE OF COLOR ONE WOULD SAY YET WE FIND IN THE SPRINGFIELD PAPER A LEADING ARTICLE BEGINNING WITH THE STARTLING ANNOUNCEMENT
7833-102239-0003 OUR STATE IS THREATENED TO BE OVERRUN WITH FREE NEGROES THE COUNTY WAS ONE OF THE RICHEST IN ILLINOIS POSSESSED OF A SOIL OF INEXHAUSTIBLE FERTILITY AND DIVIDED TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE BETWEEN PRAIRIE AND FOREST IT WAS SETTLED EARLY IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE
7833-102239-0004 AND THE COUNTRY WAS HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM BY THE ABORIGINES THE NAME OF SANGAMON IS SAID TO MEAN IN THE POTTAWATOMIE LANGUAGE LAND OF PLENTY
7833-102239-0005 A LARGE MAJORITY OF THEM FROM KENTUCKY
7833-102239-0006 MEN OF EDUCATION AND CHARACTER THERE HAD BEEN VERY LITTLE OF WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED PIONEER LIFE IN SPRINGFIELD CIVILIZATION CAME IN WITH A REASONABLY FULL EQUIPMENT AT THE BEGINNING THE EDWARDSES IN FAIR TOP BOOTS AND RUFFLED SHIRTS
7833-102239-0007 WILL SHOW HOW MUCH ATTENTION TO DRESS WAS PAID IN THE NEW CAPITAL CLOTHS CASSINETTS CASSIMERES VELVET SILK SATIN AND MARSEILLES VESTINGS FINE CALF BOOTS SEAL AND MOROCCO PUMPS FOR GENTLEMEN
7833-102239-0008 AND FOR THE SEX WHICH IN BARBARISM DRESSES LESS AND IN CIVILIZATION DRESSES MORE THAN THE MALE
7833-102239-0009 LACE VEILS THREAD LACE THIBET SHAWLS LACE HANDKERCHIEFS FINE PRUNELLA SHOES
7833-102239-0010 FROM THE GARB OF MEN THE DEERSKIN MOCCASIN SUPPLANTED BY THE LEATHER BOOT AND SHOE
7833-102239-0011 WHICH WERE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEIR FATHERS BUT WITH THE CHANGE IN DRESS CAME OTHER ALTERATIONS WHICH WERE ALL FOR THE BETTER A GROWING SELF RESPECT AMONG THE YOUNG AN INDUSTRY AND THRIFT BY WHICH THEY COULD BUY GOOD CLOTHES A HABIT OF ATTENDING RELIGIOUS SERVICE WHERE THEY COULD SHOW THEM
7833-102239-0012 A PROGRESS IN SOCIABILITY CIVILITY TRADE AND MORALS THE TASTE FOR CIVILIZATION HAD SOMETIMES A WHIMSICAL MANIFESTATION MISTER STUART SAID THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE BITTERLY COMPLAINED OF THE AMOUNT OF GAME
7833-102239-0013 WHEAT WAS FIFTY CENTS A BUSHEL RYE THIRTY THREE CORN AND OATS WERE TWENTY FIVE POTATOES TWENTY FIVE BUTTER WAS EIGHT CENTS A POUND AND EGGS WERE EIGHT CENTS A DOZEN PORK WAS TWO AND A HALF CENTS A POUND
7833-102239-0014 THE TOWN WAS BUILT ON THE EDGE OF THE WOODS THE NORTH SIDE TOUCHING THE TIMBER THE SOUTH ENCROACHING ON THE PRAIRIE THE RICHNESS OF THE SOIL WAS SEEN IN THE MUD OF THE STREETS BLACK AS INK AND OF AN UNFATHOMABLE DEPTH IN TIME OF THAW
7833-102239-0015 THERE WERE OF COURSE NO PAVEMENTS OR SIDEWALKS AN ATTEMPT AT CROSSINGS WAS MADE BY LAYING DOWN LARGE CHUNKS OF WOOD THE HOUSES WERE ALMOST ALL WOODEN AND WERE DISPOSED IN RECTANGULAR BLOCKS
7833-102239-0016 IN ANTICIPATION OF FUTURE GREATNESS AND THERE WHEN LINCOLN BEGAN HIS RESIDENCE THE WORK OF CLEARING THE GROUND FOR THE NEW STATE HOUSE WAS ALREADY GOING FORWARD IN ONE OF THE LARGEST HOUSES LOOKING ON THE SQUARE AT THE NORTH WEST CORNER THE COUNTY COURT HAD ITS OFFICES
7833-102239-0017 AND OTHER ROOMS IN THE BUILDING WERE LET TO LAWYERS ONE OF THESE WAS OCCUPIED BY STUART AND LINCOLN FOR THE FRIENDSHIP FORMED IN THE BLACK HAWK WAR AND STRENGTHENED AT VANDALIA INDUCED MAJOR STUART TO OFFER A PARTNERSHIP TO CAPTAIN LINCOLN
7833-102239-0018 NEVER USED THE DESIGNATION AFTER HE LAID DOWN HIS COMMAND LINCOLN DID NOT GAIN ANY IMMEDIATE EMINENCE AT THE BAR HIS PRELIMINARY STUDIES HAD BEEN CURSORY AND SLIGHT AND STUART WAS THEN TOO MUCH ENGROSSED IN POLITICS TO PAY THE UNREMITTING ATTENTION TO THE LAW
7833-102239-0019 WHICH THAT JEALOUS MISTRESS REQUIRES HE HAD BEEN A CANDIDATE FOR CONGRESS THE YEAR BEFORE AND HAD BEEN DEFEATED BY W L MAY HE WAS A CANDIDATE AGAIN IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT AND WAS ELECTED OVER SO AGILE AN ADVERSARY AS STEPHEN ARNOLD DOUGLAS
7833-102239-0020 HIS PARAMOUNT INTEREST IN THESE CANVASSES NECESSARILY PREVENTED HIM FROM SETTING TO HIS JUNIOR PARTNER THE EXAMPLE WHICH LINCOLN SO GREATLY NEEDED OF CLOSE AND STEADY DEVOTION TO THEIR PROFESSION
7833-102239-0021 IT WAS SEVERAL YEARS LATER THAT LINCOLN FOUND WITH JUDGE LOGAN THE COMPANIONSHIP AND INSPIRATION WHICH HE REQUIRED AND BEGAN TO BE REALLY A LAWYER DURING THE FIRST YEAR OR TWO HE IS PRINCIPALLY REMEMBERED IN SPRINGFIELD AS AN EXCELLENT TALKER
7833-102239-0022 THE LIFE AND SOUL OF THE LITTLE GATHERINGS ABOUT THE COUNTY OFFICES A STORY TELLER OF THE FIRST RANK A GOOD NATURED FRIENDLY FELLOW WHOM EVERYBODY LIKED AND TRUSTED HE RELIED MORE UPON HIS INFLUENCE WITH A JURY THAN UPON HIS KNOWLEDGE OF LAW IN THE FEW CASES HE CONDUCTED IN COURT
7833-102239-0023 AND LINCOLN REMAINED A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE BY SUCCESSIVE REELECTIONS FROM EIGHTEEN THIRTY FOUR TO EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO HIS CAMPAIGNS WERE CARRIED ON ALMOST ENTIRELY WITHOUT EXPENSE
7833-102239-0024 JOSHUA SPEED TOLD THE WRITERS THAT ON ONE OCCASION SOME OF THE WHIGS CONTRIBUTED A PURSE OF TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH SPEED HANDED TO LINCOLN TO PAY HIS PERSONAL EXPENSES IN THE CANVASS
7833-102239-0025 WITH THE REQUEST THAT HE RETURN IT TO THE SUBSCRIBERS I DID NOT NEED THE MONEY HE SAID I MADE THE CANVASS ON MY OWN HORSE MY ENTERTAINMENT BEING AT THE HOUSES OF FRIENDS COST ME NOTHING AND MY ONLY OUTLAY WAS SEVENTY FIVE CENTS FOR A BARREL OF CIDER
7833-102239-0026 THE MAGNIFICENT SCHEMES OF THE FOREGOING WINTER REQUIRED SOME REPAIRING THE BANKS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES HAD SUSPENDED SPECIE PAYMENTS IN THE SPRING AND AS THE STATE BANKS IN ILLINOIS WERE THE FISCAL AGENTS OF THE RAILROADS AND CANALS
7833-102239-0027 THE GOVERNOR CALLED UPON THE LAW MAKERS TO REVISE THEIR OWN WORK TO LEGALIZE THE SUSPENSION AND BRING THEIR IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM WITHIN POSSIBLE BOUNDS THEY ACTED AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED COMPLIED WITH THE FORMER SUGGESTION BUT FLATLY REFUSED TO TOUCH THEIR MASTERPIECE
7833-102239-0028 THEY HAD BEEN GLORIFYING THEIR WORK TOO ENERGETICALLY TO DESTROY IT IN ITS INFANCY IT WAS SAID YOU COULD RECOGNIZE A LEGISLATOR THAT YEAR IN ANY CROWD BY HIS AUTOMATIC REPETITION OF THE PHRASE THIRTEEN HUNDRED FELLOW CITIZTENS AND FIFTY MILES OF RAILROAD
7833-102239-0029 THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT TO GO ON WITH THE STUPENDOUS FOLLY LOANS WERE EFFECTED WITH SURPRISING AND FATAL FACILITY AND BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR WORK HAD BEGUN AT MANY POINTS ON THE RAILROADS THE WHOLE STATE WAS EXCITED TO THE HIGHEST PITCH OF FRENZY AND EXPECTATION
7833-102239-0030 THE WORK WAS BEGUN ON A MAGNIFICENT SCALE NINE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WERE THOUGHT TO BE A MERE TRIFLE IN VIEW OF THE COLOSSAL SUM EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED FROM THE SALE OF CANAL LANDS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN BY THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT
7833-102239-0031 THERE WERE RUMORS OF COMING TROUBLE AND OF AN UNHEALTHY CONDITION OF THE BANKS
7833-102239-0032 MISTER CYRUS EDWARDS BOLDLY MADE HIS CANVASS FOR GOVERNOR AS A SUPPORTER OF THE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS AND HIS OPPONENT THOMAS CARLIN WAS CAREFUL NOT TO COMMIT HIMSELF STRONGLY ON THE OTHER SIDE
7833-102239-0033 CARLIN WAS ELECTED AND FINDING THAT A MAJORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS STILL OPPOSED TO ANY STEPS BACKWARD HE MADE NO DEMONSTRATION AGAINST THE SYSTEM AT THE FIRST SESSION LINCOLN WAS A MEMBER OF THIS BODY
7833-102239-0034 AND BEING BY THAT TIME THE UNQUESTIONED LEADER OF THE WHIG MINORITY WAS NOMINATED FOR SPEAKER AND CAME WITHIN ONE VOTE OF AN ELECTION THE LEGISLATURE WAS STILL STIFF NECKED AND PERVERSE IN REGARD TO THE SYSTEM
7833-102239-0035 IT REFUSED TO MODIFY IT IN THE LEAST AND VOTED AS IF IN BRAVADO ANOTHER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO EXTEND IT BUT THIS WAS THE LAST PAROXYSM OF A FEVER THAT WAS BURNT OUT THE MARKET WAS GLUTTED WITH ILLINOIS BONDS
7833-102239-0036 FAILED OR MADE AWAY WITH THE PROCEEDS OF SALES THE SYSTEM HAD UTTERLY FAILED THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT REPEAL IT STOP WORK UPON THE VISIONARY ROADS AND ENDEAVOR TO INVENT SOME MEANS OF PAYING THE ENORMOUS DEBT
7833-102239-0037 THIS WORK TAXED THE ENERGIES OF THE LEGISLATURE IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
7833-102239-0038 NOT ESPECIALLY WISER THAN THE REST WAS CONTRIBUTED BY MISTER LINCOLN IT PROVIDED FOR THE ISSUE OF BONDS FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE INTEREST DUE BY THE STATE AND FOR THE APPROPRIATION OF A SPECIAL PORTION OF STATE TAXES TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS THUS INCURRED
7833-102239-0039 HE SUPPORTED HIS BILL IN A PERFECTLY CHARACTERISTIC SPEECH MAKING NO EFFORT TO EVADE HIS SHARE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CRISIS AND SUBMITTING HIS VIEWS WITH DIFFIDENCE TO THE APPROVAL OF THE ASSEMBLY HIS PLAN WAS NOT ADOPTED
7833-102239-0040 IT WAS TOO SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD EVEN IF IT HAD ANY OTHER MERITS TO MEET THE APPROVAL OF AN ASSEMBLY INTENT ONLY UPON GETTING OUT OF IMMEDIATE EMBARRASSMENT BY MEANS WHICH MIGHT SAVE THEM FUTURE TROUBLE ON THE STUMP THERE WAS EVEN AN UNDERCURRENT OF SENTIMENT IN FAVOR OF REPUDIATION
7833-102239-0041 AND HOW MUCH INTEREST WAS THEREFORE TO BE PAID BONDS WERE SOLD FOR THIS PURPOSE AT A HEAVY LOSS THIS SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS ENLIVENED BY A SINGULAR CONTEST BETWEEN THE WHIGS AND DEMOCRATS IN RELATION TO THE STATE BANKS
7833-102239-0042 THEIR SUSPENSION OF SPECIE PAYMENTS HAD BEEN LEGALIZED UP TO THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE NEXT SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE THEY WERE NOT NOW ABLE TO RESUME
7833-102239-0043 THE CHARTER OF THE BANKS WOULD BE FORFEITED A PURPOSE THE PARTY WAS EAGER TO ACCOMPLISH
7833-102239-0044 BY THE BANKS IN WHICH IT MAY BE HERE SAID THEY WERE FINALLY SUCCESSFUL BUT ON ONE OCCASION BEING IN THE MINORITY AND HAVING EXHAUSTED EVERY OTHER PARLIAMENTARY MEANS OF OPPOSITION AND DELAY AND SEEING THE VOTE THEY DREADED IMMINENT
7833-102239-0045 THEY TRIED TO DEFEAT IT BY LEAVING THE HOUSE IN A BODY AND THE DOORS BEING LOCKED A NUMBER OF THEM
7833-102239-0046 JUMPED FROM THE WINDOWS OF THE CHURCH WHERE THE LEGISLATURE WAS THEN HOLDING ITS SESSIONS I THINK SAYS MISTER JOSEPH GILLESPIE WHO WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO PERFORMED THIS FEAT OF ACROBATIC POLITICS MISTER LINCOLN ALWAYS REGRETTED IT
7833-102239-0047 NOTHING WAS LEFT OF THE BRILLIANT SCHEMES OF THE HISTORIC LEGISLATURE OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX BUT A LOAD OF DEBT WHICH CRIPPLED FOR MANY YEARS THE ENERGIES OF THE PEOPLE A FEW MILES OF EMBANKMENTS WHICH THE GRASS HASTENED TO COVER
7833-102239-0048 AND A FEW ABUTMENTS WHICH STOOD FOR YEARS BY THE SIDES OF LEAFY RIVERS WAITING FOR THEIR LONG DELAYING BRIDGES AND TRAINS
7833-102239-0049 BUT WE THINK THAT FEW MEN HAVE EVER LIVED WHO WERE MORE FREE FROM THOSE DEGRADING PASSIONS THAN ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND THE PERSONAL REPROBATION WITH WHICH HE ALWAYS VISITED THE PUBLIC ACTS OF DOUGLAS AROSE FROM HIS SINCERE CONVICTION THAT ABLE AS DOUGLAS WAS
7833-102239-0050 AND IN MANY RESPECTS ADMIRABLE IN CHARACTER HE WAS ESSENTIALLY WITHOUT FIXED POLITICAL MORALS
7833-102239-0051 WHERE DOUGLAS WAS BUSY IN GETTING THE CIRCUIT ATTORNEYSHIP AWAY FROM JOHN J HARDIN HE HELD IT ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO SECURE A NOMINATION TO THE LEGISLATURE IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX
7833-102239-0052 WHERE HE LIVED BUT HE GAVE UP THE FIGHT FOR THE PURPOSE OF HAVING HIMSELF APPOINTED REGISTER OF THE LAND OFFICE AT SPRINGFIELD HE HELD THIS PLACE AS A MEANS OF BEING NOMINATED FOR CONGRESS THE NEXT YEAR HE WAS NOMINATED AND DEFEATED IN EIGHTEEN FORTY
7833-102239-0053 MEANT TO INCLUDE ALIENS IN THAT CATEGORY AS THE ALIENS WERE NEARLY ALL DEMOCRATS THAT PARTY INSISTED ON THEIR VOTING AND THE WHIGS OBJECTED
7833-102239-0054 CHIEF AMONG WHOM WAS MISTER DOUGLAS WERE IN SOME ANXIETY AS AN UNFAVORABLE DECISION WOULD LOSE THEM ABOUT TEN THOUSAND ALIEN VOTES IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN NOVEMBER IN THIS CONJUNCTURE ONE JUDGE SMITH OF THE SUPREME COURT AN ARDENT DEMOCRAT
7833-102239-0055 COMMUNICATED TO MISTER DOUGLAS TWO IMPORTANT FACTS FIRST THAT A MAJORITY OF THE COURT WOULD CERTAINLY DECIDE AGAINST THE ALIENS AND SECONDLY
7833-102239-0056 AND SAVE THE ALIEN VOTE FOR VAN BUREN AND THE DEMOCRATIC TICKET THIS WAS DONE
7833-102239-0057 MISTER DOUGLAS HANDED IN A BILL REFORMING THE JUDICIARY FOR THEY HAD LEARNED THAT SERVICEABLE WORD ALREADY THE CIRCUIT JUDGES WERE TURNED OUT OF OFFICE AND FIVE NEW JUDGES WERE ADDED TO THE SUPREME COURT WHO WERE TO PERFORM CIRCUIT DUTY ALSO
7833-102239-0058 IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT JUDGE DOUGLAS WAS ONE OF THESE
7833-102239-0059 THERE WAS NO RESOURCE BUT A PROTEST AND HERE AGAIN LINCOLN UTTERED THE VOICE OF THE CONSCIENCE OF THE PARTY HE WAS JOINED ON THIS OCCASION BY EDWARD D BAKER FOOTNOTE AFTERWARDS SENATOR FROM OREGON AND AS COLONEL OF THE SEVENTY FIRST PENNSYLVANIA
7833-102239-0060 CALLED THE FIRST CALIFORNIA KILLED AT BALL'S BLUFF AND SOME OTHERS WHO PROTESTED AGAINST THE ACT BECAUSE FIRST IT VIOLATES THE PRINCIPLES OF FREE GOVERNMENT BY SUBJECTING THE JUDICIARY TO THE LEGISLATURE
7833-102239-0061 FOURTH IT WILL GREATLY INCREASE THE EXPENSE OF OUR COURTS OR ELSE GREATLY DIMINISH THEIR UTILITY FIFTH IT WILL GIVE OUR COURTS A POLITICAL AND PARTISAN CHARACTER THEREBY IMPAIRING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THEIR DECISIONS SIXTH
