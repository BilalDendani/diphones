4824-36048-0000 CHAPTER SIX KEYS AND CHEQUES COMING UP TRAFALGAR ROAD AT TWENTY MINUTES PAST NINE IN THE BRIGHT ASTRINGENT MORNING EDWIN CARRIED BY A STRING A LITTLE ROUND PARCEL
4824-36048-0001 WHICH FOR HIM CONTAINED THE INSPIRING SYMBOL OF HIS NEW LIFE BY MERE ACCIDENT HE HAD WAKENED AND HAD RISEN EARLY ARRIVING AT THE SHOP BEFORE HALF PAST SEVEN
4824-36048-0002 AND THE PRINTING BUSINESS AND AS SOON AS HE FELT ITS WEIGHT SECURELY LODGED HE BECAME EXTRAORDINARILY ANIMATED AND VIGOROUS EVEN GAY HE HAD WORKED WITH A MOST AGREEABLE SENSE OF ENERGY UNTIL NEARLY NINE O'CLOCK
4824-36048-0003 AND THEN HAVING FIRST CALLED AT THE IRONMONGER'S HAD STEPPED INTO THE BANK AT THE TOP OF SAINT LUKE'S SQUARE A MOMENT AFTER ITS DOORS OPENED AND HAD FIVE MINUTES EXCITING CONVERSATION WITH THE MANAGER
4824-36048-0004 HE HAD COME HOME TO BREAKFAST THE SYMBOL WAS SUCH AS COULD BE OBTAINED AT ANY IRONMONGER'S AN ALARM CLOCK MISSUS NIXON HAD GROWN LESS RELIABLE THAN FORMERLY AS AN ALARM CLOCK MACHINERY WAS NOW SUPPLANTING HER
4824-36048-0005 THE TWO MET ON THE DOORSTEP EACH FULL OF A JUSTIFIABLE SELF SATISFACTION THE DOCTOR EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD COME THUS EARLY BECAUSE MISTER CLAYHANGER WAS ONE OF THOSE CASES UPON WHICH HE COULD LOOK IN CASUALLY AT ANY TIME
4824-36048-0006 IN THE SUNSHINE THEY TALKED UNDER THE PORCH OF EARLY RISING AS MEN WHO UNDERSTOOD THE VALUE OF THAT ART
4824-36048-0007 BY ANY LARGE INTEREST AND HE DESPISED THE MAN'S WOMANISH SMILE NEVERTHELESS HIS NEW RESPECT FOR HIM DID NOT WEAKEN HE DECIDED THAT HE WAS A VERY DECENT FELLOW IN HIS WAY
4824-36048-0008 AND HE WAS MORE IMPRESSED THAN HE WOULD ADMIT BY THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT THE DOCTOR HAD FOR YEARS BEEN DOING IN THE MORNING BEFORE HIS INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORS HAD SAT UP IN BED
4824-36048-0009 AND HE IMAGINED THAT IT MIGHT BE EVEN MORE AGREEABLE TO READ IN THE FRESH STILLNESS OF THE MORNING THAN IN THE SOLITARY NIGHT THEN THEY RETURNED TO THE CASE OF DARIUS THE DOCTOR WAS MORE COMMUNICATIVE
4824-36048-0010 AND THEY WERE BOTH CHEERFULLY MATTER OF FACT CONCERNING IT THERE IT WAS TO BE MADE THE BEST OF
4824-36048-0011 AND THAT IN ABOUT TWO YEARS HIS DOOM WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED THESE WERE BASIC FACTS AXIOMATIC
4824-36048-0012 THEY DISCUSSED HIS MEDICINE HIS MEALS HIS DIGESTION AND THE GREAT IMPOSSIBLE DREAM OF TAKING HIM AWAY OUT OF IT ALL
4824-36048-0013 AS TO THE MANAGEMENT OF DARIUS THE TICKING PARCEL DREW THE DISCREET ATTENTION OF THE DOCTOR THE MACHINE WAS ONE GUARANTEED TO GO IN ANY POSITION AND WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO STOP THAN TO START
4824-36048-0014 IT'S ONLY AN ALARM SAID EDWIN NOT WITHOUT SELF CONSCIOUSNESS THE DOCTOR WENT TRIPPING NEATLY AND OPTIMISTICALLY OFF TOWARDS HIS OWN BREAKFAST HE GOT UP EARLIER THAN HIS HORSE
4824-36048-0015 HE HAD PUT ON HIS DAILY SUIT AND WAS LEISURELY DIGGING IN AN UNCULTIVATED PATCH OF GROUND HE STUCK THE SPADE INTO THE EARTH PERPENDICULARLY AND DEEP
4824-36048-0016 AND WHEN HE TRIED TO PRISE IT UP AND IT WOULD NOT YIELD BECAUSE OF A CONCEALED HALF BRICK HE PUT HIS TONGUE BETWEEN HIS TEETH AND THEN BIT HIS LOWER LIP CONTROLLING HIMSELF DETERMINED TO GET THE BETTER OF THE SPADE AND THE BRICK BY PERSUASIVELY HUMOURING THEM
4824-36048-0017 HE TOOK NO NOTICE WHATEVER OF EDWIN I SEE YOU AREN'T LOSING ANY TIME SAID EDWIN WHO FELT AS THOUGH HE WERE ENGAGING IN SMALL TALK WITH A STRANGER ARE
4824-36048-0018 I'VE JUST COME UP FOR A BIT OF BREAKFAST EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO ADD I WAS IN THE SHOP BEFORE SEVEN THIRTY BUT HE WAS TOO PROUD AFTER A PAUSE HE VENTURED ESSAYING THE CASUAL
4824-36048-0019 I SAY FATHER I SHALL WANT THE KEYS OF THE DESK AND ALL THAT
4824-36048-0020 DARIUS MUTTERED LEANING ON THE SPADE AS THOUGH DEMANDING IN STUPEFACTION WHAT ON EARTH CAN YOU WANT THE KEYS FOR WELL EDWIN STAMMERED BUT THE PROPOSITION WAS TOO OBVIOUS TO BE DENIED
4824-36048-0021 DARIUS LEFT THE SPADE TO STAND UP BY ITSELF AND STARED GOT EM IN YOUR POCKET EDWIN INQUIRED
4824-36048-0022 ONE OF THE CHIEF INSIGNIA OF HIS DOMINION AND BEGAN TO FUMBLE AT IT YOU NEEDN'T TAKE ANY OF THEM OFF I EXPECT I KNOW WHICH IS WHICH SAID EDWIN HOLDING OUT HIS HAND
4824-36048-0023 THANKS SAID EDWIN LIGHTLY BUT THE OLD MAN'S RELUCTANCE TO PERFORM THIS SIMPLE AND ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY ACT OF SURRENDER THE OLD MAN'S AIR OF HAVING DONE SOMETHING TREMENDOUS
4824-36048-0024 THESE SIGNS FRIGHTENED EDWIN AND SHOOK HIS COURAGE FOR THE DEMAND COMPARED TO WHICH THE DEMAND FOR THE KEYS WAS NAUGHT STILL THE AFFAIR HAD TO BE CARRIED THROUGH AND I SAY HE PROCEEDED JINGLING THE KEYS
4824-36048-0025 ABOUT SIGNING AND ENDORSING CHEQUES THEY TELL ME AT THE BANK THAT IF YOU SIGN A GENERAL AUTHORITY TO ME TO DO IT FOR YOU THAT WILL BE ENOUGH HE COULD NOT AVOID LOOKING GUILTY HE ALMOST FELT GUILTY
4824-36048-0026 ALMOST FELT AS IF HE WERE PLOTTING AGAINST HIS FATHER'S WELFARE AND AS HE SPOKE HIS WORDS SEEMED UNREAL AND HIS SUGGESTION FANTASTIC AT THE BANK THE PLAN HAD BEEN SIMPLE EASY AND PERFECTLY NATURAL
4824-36048-0027 BUT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT AS HE HAD WALKED UP TRAFALGAR ROAD RECEDING FROM THE BANK AND APPROACHING HIS FATHER THE PLAN HAD GRADUALLY LOST THOSE ATTRACTIVE QUALITIES AND NOW IN THE GARDEN IT WAS MERELY MONSTROUS
4824-36048-0028 WELL SAID EDWIN DESPERATELY WHAT ABOUT IT DO YOU THINK
4824-36048-0029 DO YOU THINK AS I'M GOING TO LET YOU SIGN MY CHEQUES FOR ME YOU'RE TAKING TOO MUCH ON YOURSELF MY LAD BUT I TELL YE YOU'RE TAKING TOO MUCH ON YOURSELF HE BEGAN TO SHOUT MENACINGLY GET ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS AND DON'T ACT THE FOOL
4824-36048-0030 IN ALL HIS DEMEANOUR THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST INDICATION OF WEAKNESS HE MIGHT NEVER HAVE SAT DOWN ON THE STAIRS AND CRIED HE MIGHT NEVER HAVE SUBMITTED FEEBLY AND PERHAPS GLADLY TO THE CARESSES OF CLARA AND THE SOOTHINGS OF AUNTIE HAMPS
4824-36048-0031 IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVINCE HIM THAT HE WAS CUT OFF FROM THE WORLD IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO BELIEVE IT WAS THIS THE MAN THAT EDWIN AND THE BANK MANAGER AND THE DOCTOR AND ALL THE OTHERS HAD BEEN DISPOSING OF
4824-36048-0032 AS THOUGH HE WERE AN AUTOMATON ACCURATELY RESPONSIVE TO EXTERNAL SUGGESTION LOOK HERE EDWIN KNEW THAT HE OUGHT TO SAY LET IT BE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD ONCE FOR ALL I'M THE BOSS NOW
4824-36048-0033 I HAVE THE AUTHORITY IN MY POCKET AND YOU MUST SIGN IT AND QUICK TOO I SHALL DO MY BEST FOR YOU BUT I DON'T MEAN TO BE BULLIED WHILE I'M DOING IT BUT HE COULD NOT SAY IT NOR COULD HIS HEART EMOTIONALLY FEEL IT
4824-36048-0034 HE TURNED AWAY SHEEPISHLY AND THEN HE FACED HIS FATHER AGAIN WITH A DISTRESSED APOLOGETIC SMILE WELL THEN HE ASKED WHO IS GOING TO SIGN CHEQUES I AM SAID DARIUS
4824-36048-0035 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID YOU KNOW WHAT YOU PROMISED HIM WHAT DID THE DOCTOR SAY HE SAID YOU WEREN'T TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL AND YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T WHAT'S MORE YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DARIUS SNEERED
4824-36048-0036 I RECKON I CAN SIGN CHEQUES HE SAID AND I RECKON I CAN ENDORSE CHEQUES SO IT'S GOT TO THAT I CAN'T SIGN MY OWN NAME NOW I SHALL SHOW SOME OF YOU WHETHER I CAN'T SIGN MY OWN NAME
4824-36048-0037 YOU KNOW IT ISN'T SIMPLY SIGNING THEM YOU KNOW IF I BRING CHEQUES UP FOR YOU TO SIGN YOU'LL BEGIN WORRYING ABOUT THEM AT ONCE
4824-36048-0038 YOU'D MUCH BETTER SHUT UP IT WAS LIKE A CLAP OF THUNDER EDWIN HESITATED AN INSTANT AND THEN WENT TOWARDS THE HOUSE HE COULD HEAR HIS FATHER MUTTERING WHIPPER SNAPPER AND I'LL TELL YOU ANOTHER THING
4824-36048-0039 DARIUS BAWLED ACROSS THE GARDEN ASSUREDLY HIS VOICE WOULD REACH THE STREET IT WAS LIKE YOUR IMPUDENCE TO GO TO THE BANK LIKE THAT WITHOUT ASKING ME FIRST THEY TELL YOU AT THE BANK THEY TELL YOU AT THE BANK ANYTHING ELSE THEY TOLD YOU AT THE BANK
4824-36048-0040 THEN A SNORT EDWIN WAS HUMILIATED AND BAFFLED HE KNEW NOT WHAT HE COULD DO THE SITUATION BECAME IMPOSSIBLE IMMEDIATELY IT WAS FACED HE FELT ALSO VERY RESENTFUL AND RESENTMENT WAS CAPTURING HIM
4824-36048-0041 WHEN SUDDENLY AN IDEA SEEMED TO PULL HIM BY THE SLEEVE ALL THIS IS PART OF HIS DISEASE IT'S PART OF HIS DISEASE THAT HE CAN'T SEE THE POINT OF A THING AND THE IDEA WAS INSISTENT
4824-36048-0042 AND UNDER ITS INSISTENCE EDWIN'S RESENTMENT CHANGED TO MELANCHOLY HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE MUST THINK OF HIS FATHER AS A CHILD HE BLAMED HIMSELF IN A SORT OF PLEASURABLE LUXURY OF REMORSE
4824-36048-0043 FOR ALL THE ANGER WHICH DURING ALL HIS LIFE HE HAD FELT AGAINST HIS FATHER HIS FATHER'S UNREASONABLENESS HAD NOT BEEN A FAULT BUT A MISFORTUNE HIS FATHER HAD BEEN NOT A TYRANT BUT A VICTIM
4824-36048-0044 HIS BRAIN MUST ALWAYS HAVE BEEN WRONG AND NOW HE WAS DOOMED AND THE WORST PART OF HIS DOOM WAS THAT HE WAS UNAWARE OF IT
4824-36048-0045 CONDEMNED CUT OFF HELPLESS AT THE LAST PITIABLE AT THE LAST THERE WAS SOMETHING INEXPRESSIBLY POIGNANT AND THE SUNSHINE SEEMED A SHAME AND EDWIN'S YOUTH AND MENTAL VIGOUR SEEMED A SHAME
4824-36048-0046 NEVERTHELESS EDWIN KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO MASTER EDWIN SAID MISSUS NIXON WHO WAS RUBBING THE BALUSTRADE OF THE STAIRS YOU MUNNA CROSS HIM LIKE THAT SHE JERKED HER HEAD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE GARDEN THE GARDEN DOOR STOOD OPEN
