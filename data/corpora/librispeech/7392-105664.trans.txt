7392-105664-0000 THE CONDUCT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALONE REQUIRED EFFORT AND APPLICATION AND THEY WERE NOW BROUGHT TO SUCH A SITUATION THAT IT WAS NO LONGER SAFE FOR ENGLAND TO REMAIN ENTIRELY NEUTRAL THE FEIGNED MODERATION OF THE EMPEROR WAS OF SHORT DURATION
7392-105664-0001 AND IT WAS SOON OBVIOUS TO ALL THE WORLD THAT HIS GREAT DOMINIONS FAR FROM GRATIFYING HIS AMBITION WERE ONLY REGARDED AS THE MEANS OF ACQUIRING AN MORE EXTENSIVE THE TERMS WHICH HE DEMANDED OF HIS PRISONER
7392-105664-0002 HE SAID THAT HE WOULD RATHER LIVE AND DIE A PRISONER THAN AGREE TO DISMEMBER HIS KINGDOM AND THAT EVEN WERE HE SO BASE AS TO SUBMIT TO SUCH CONDITIONS HIS SUBJECTS WOULD NEVER PERMIT HIM TO CARRY THEM INTO EXECUTION
7392-105664-0003 HE WAS UNEASY HOWEVER TO BE SO FAR DISTANT FROM THE EMPEROR WITH WHOM HE MUST TREAT AND HE EXPRESSED HIS DESIRE WHICH WAS COMPLIED WITH TO BE REMOVED TO MADRID
7392-105664-0004 HE WAS SOON CONVINCED OF HIS MISTAKE PARTLY FROM WANT OF EXERCISE PARTLY FROM REFLECTIONS ON HIS PRESENT MELANCHOLY SITUATION HE FELL INTO A LANGUISHING ILLNESS WHICH BEGAT APPREHENSIONS IN CHARLES
7392-105664-0005 LEST THE DEATH OF HIS CAPTIVE SHOULD BEREAVE HIM OF ALL THOSE ADVANTAGES WHICH HE PURPOSED TO EXTORT FROM HIM HE THEN PAID HIM A VISIT IN THE CASTLE OF MADRID AND AS HE APPROACHED THE BED IN WHICH FRANCIS LAY THE SICK MONARCH CALLED TO HIM
7392-105664-0006 BY WHICH IT WAS HOPED AN END WOULD BE FINALLY PUT TO THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE GREAT MONARCHS THE PRINCIPAL CONDITION WAS THE RESTORING OF FRANCIS'S LIBERTY AND THE DELIVERY OF HIS TWO ELDEST SONS AS HOSTAGES TO THE EMPEROR
7392-105664-0007 AND CHARLES DISCOVERED EVIDENTLY HIS INTENTION OF REDUCING ITALY AS WELL AS FRANCE TO SUBJECTION AND DEPENDENCE
7392-105664-0008 OR RATHER RUINOUS AND DESTRUCTIVE TO HIMSELF HIS POSTERITY AND HIS COUNTRY BY PUTTING BURGUNDY THEY THOUGHT INTO THE EMPEROR'S HANDS HE GAVE HIS POWERFUL ENEMY AN ENTRANCE INTO THE HEART OF THE KINGDOM BY SACRIFICING HIS ALLIES IN ITALY
7392-105664-0009 HE DEPRIVED HIMSELF OF FOREIGN ASSISTANCE AND ARMING HIS OPPRESSOR WITH THE WHOLE FORCE AND WEALTH OF THAT OPULENT COUNTRY RENDERED HIM ABSOLUTELY IRRESISTIBLE TO THESE GREAT VIEWS OF INTEREST WERE ADDED THE MOTIVES
7392-105664-0010 WHICH HAD BEEN EXACTED OF HIM FOR THE RECOVERY OF HIS LIBERTY IT WAS ALSO FORESEEN THAT THE EMULATION AND RIVALSHIP WHICH HAD SO LONG SUBSISTED BETWEEN THESE TWO MONARCHS WOULD MAKE HIM FEEL THE STRONGEST RELUCTANCE ON YIELDING THE SUPERIORITY TO AN ANTAGONIST WHO
7392-105664-0011 BY THE WHOLE TENOR OF HIS CONDUCT HE WOULD BE APT TO THINK HAD SHOWN HIMSELF SO LITTLE WORTHY OF THAT ADVANTAGE WHICH FORTUNE AND FORTUNE ALONE HAD PUT INTO HIS HANDS HIS MINISTERS HIS FRIENDS HIS SUBJECTS HIS ALLIES
7392-105664-0012 WHEN THE SPANISH ENVOY DEMANDED HIS RATIFICATION OF THE TREATY OF MADRID NOW THAT HE HAD FULLY RECOVERED HIS LIBERTY HE DECLINED THE PROPOSAL UNDER COLOR THAT IT WAS PREVIOUSLY NECESSARY TO ASSEMBLE THE STATES BOTH OF FRANCE AND OF BURGUNDY
7392-105664-0013 AND TO OBTAIN THEIR CONSENT THE STATES OF BURGUNDY SOON MET AND DECLARING AGAINST THE CLAUSE WHICH CONTAINED AN ENGAGEMENT FOR ALIENATING THEIR PROVINCE THEY EXPRESSED THEIR RESOLUTION OF OPPOSING
7392-105664-0014 AND EVEN DESTRUCTIVE OF HIS INDEPENDENCY HAD VERY FRANKLY OFFERED HIM A DISPENSATION FROM ALL HIS OATHS AND ENGAGEMENTS FRANCIS REMAINED NOT IN SUSPENSE BUT ENTERED IMMEDIATELY INTO THE CONFEDERACY PROPOSED TO HIM
7392-105664-0015 IT WAS STIPULATED BY THAT KING THE POPE THE VENETIANS THE SWISS THE FLORENTINES AND THE DUKE OF MILAN AMONG OTHER ARTICLES THAT THEY WOULD OBLIGE THE EMPEROR TO DELIVER UP THE TWO YOUNG PRINCES OF FRANCE ON RECEIVING A REASONABLE SUM OF MONEY
7392-105664-0016 THE KING OF ENGLAND WAS INVITED TO ACCEDE NOT ONLY AS A CONTRACTING PARTY
7392-105664-0017 OF WHICH THE EMPEROR INTENDED TO GRANT HIM THE INVESTITURE AND HAVING LEVIED A CONSIDERABLE ARMY IN GERMANY HE BECAME FORMIDABLE TO ALL THE ITALIAN POTENTATES AND NOT THE LESS SO BECAUSE CHARLES DESTITUTE AS USUAL OF MONEY
7392-105664-0018 HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO REMIT ANY PAY TO THE FORCES THE GENERAL WAS EXTREMELY BELOVED BY HIS TROOPS AND IN ORDER TO PREVENT THOSE MUTINIES WHICH WERE READY TO BREAK OUT EVERY MOMENT AND WHICH THEIR AFFECTION ALONE FOR HIM HAD HITHERTO RESTRAINED
7392-105664-0019 HE LED THEM TO ROME AND PROMISED TO ENRICH THEM BY THE PLUNDER OF THAT OPULENT CITY HE WAS HIMSELF KILLED AS HE WAS PLANTING A SCALING LADDER AGAINST THE WALLS BUT HIS SOLDIERS RATHER ENRAGED THAN DISCOURAGED BY HIS DEATH
7392-105664-0020 MOUNTED TO THE ASSAULT WITH THE UTMOST VALOR AND ENTERING THE CITY SWORD IN HAND EXERCISED ALL THOSE BRUTALITIES WHICH MAY BE EXPECTED FROM FEROCITY EXCITED BY RESISTANCE AND FROM INSOLENCE WHICH TAKES PLACE WHEN THAT RESISTANCE IS NO MORE
7392-105664-0021 THIS RENOWNED CITY EXPOSED BY HER RENOWN ALONE TO SO MANY CALAMITIES NEVER ENDURED IN ANY AGE EVEN FROM THE BARBARIANS BY WHOM SHE WAS OFTEN SUBDUED SUCH INDIGNITIES AS SHE WAS NOW COMPELLED TO SUFFER
7392-105664-0022 THE UNRESTRAINED MASSACRE AND PILLAGE WHICH CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL DAYS WERE THE LEAST ILLS TO WHICH THE UNHAPPY ROMANS WERE EXPOSED WHATEVER WAS RESPECTABLE IN MODESTY OR SACRED IN RELIGION
7392-105664-0023 OR PURCHASE LIBERTY BY EXORBITANT RANSOMS CLEMENT HIMSELF WHO HAD TRUSTED FOR PROTECTION TO THE SACREDNESS OF HIS CHARACTER AND NEGLECTED TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE IN TIME WAS TAKEN CAPTIVE
7392-105664-0024 AND FOUND THAT HIS DIGNITY WHICH PROCURED HIM NO REGARD FROM THE SPANISH SOLDIERS DID BUT DRAW ON HIM THE INSOLENT MOCKERY OF THE GERMAN WHO BEING GENERALLY ATTACHED TO THE LUTHERAN PRINCIPLES
7392-105664-0025 WERE PLEASED TO GRATIFY THEIR ANIMOSITY BY THE ABASEMENT OF THE SOVEREIGN PONTIFF WHEN INTELLIGENCE OF THIS GREAT EVENT WAS CONVEYED TO THE EMPEROR THAT YOUNG PRINCE HABITUATED TO HYPOCRISY
7392-105664-0026 EXPRESSED THE MOST PROFOUND SORROW FOR THE SUCCESS OF HIS ARMS HE PUT HIMSELF AND ALL HIS COURT IN MOURNING HE STOPPED THE REJOICINGS FOR THE BIRTH OF HIS SON PHILIP AND KNOWING THAT EVERY ARTIFICE HOWEVER GROSS
7392-105664-0027 TO IMPOSE UPON THE PEOPLE HE ORDERED PRAYERS DURING SEVERAL MONTHS TO BE PUT UP IN THE CHURCHES FOR THE POPE'S LIBERTY WHICH ALL MEN KNEW A LETTER UNDER HIS HAND COULD IN A MOMENT HAVE PROCURED
7392-105664-0028 THE CONCERN EXPRESSED BY HENRY AND FRANCIS FOR THE CALAMITY OF THEIR ALLY WAS MORE SINCERE THESE TWO MONARCHS A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE SACK OF ROME HAD CONCLUDED A TREATY AT WESTMINSTER IN WHICH BESIDES RENEWING FORMER ALLIANCES
7392-105664-0029 THEY AGREED TO SEND AMBASSADORS TO CHARLES REQUIRING HIM TO ACCEPT OF TWO MILLIONS OF CROWNS AS THE RANSOM OF THE FRENCH PRINCES AND TO REPAY THE MONEY BORROWED FROM HENRY AND IN CASE OF REFUSAL THE AMBASSADORS ATTENDED BY HERALDS
7392-105664-0030 THAN THEY CHANGED BY A NEW TREATY THE SCENE OF THE PROJECTED WAR FROM THE NETHERLANDS TO ITALY AND HEARING OF THE POPE'S CAPTIVITY THEY WERE FURTHER STIMULATED TO UNDERTAKE THE WAR WITH VIGOR FOR RESTORING HIM TO LIBERTY
7392-105664-0031 WOLSEY HIMSELF CROSSED THE SEA IN ORDER TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH FRANCIS AND TO CONCERT MEASURES FOR THAT PURPOSE AND HE DISPLAYED ALL THAT GRANDEUR AND MAGNIFICENCE WITH WHICH HE WAS SO MUCH INTOXICATED
7392-105664-0032 HE WAS ATTENDED BY A TRAIN OF A THOUSAND HORSE THE CARDINAL OF LORRAINE AND THE CHANCELLOR ALENCON MET HIM AT BOULOGNE FRANCIS HIMSELF BESIDES GRANTING TO THAT HAUGHTY PRELATE
7392-105664-0033 THE POWER OF GIVING IN EVERY PLACE WHERE HE CAME LIBERTY TO ALL PRISONERS
7392-105664-0034 AND AS THE EMPEROR SEEMED TO BE TAKING SOME STEPS TOWARDS ASSEMBLING A GENERAL COUNCIL THE TWO MONARCHS AGREED NOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT BUT DURING THE INTERVAL OF THE POPE'S CAPTIVITY
7392-105664-0035 IT WAS AGREED THAT THE PARLIAMENTS AND GREAT NOBILITY OF BOTH KINGDOMS SHOULD GIVE THEIR ASSENT TO IT THE MARESCHAL MONTMORENCY ACCOMPANIED BY MANY PERSONS OF DISTINCTION
7392-105664-0036 WAS SENT OVER TO RATIFY THE TREATY AND WAS RECEIVED AT LONDON WITH ALL THE PARADE WHICH SUITED THE SOLEMNITY OF THE OCCASION THE TERROR OF THE EMPEROR'S GREATNESS HAD EXTINGUISHED THE ANCIENT ANIMOSITY BETWEEN THE NATIONS AND SPAIN
7392-105664-0037 DURING MORE THAN A CENTURY BECAME THOUGH A MORE DISTANT POWER THE CHIEF OBJECT OF JEALOUSY TO THE ENGLISH THIS CORDIAL UNION BETWEEN FRANCE AND ENGLAND THOUGH IT ADDED INFLUENCE TO THE JOINT EMBASSY WHICH THEY SENT TO THE EMPEROR
7392-105664-0038 WAS NOT ABLE TO BEND THAT MONARCH TO SUBMIT ENTIRELY TO THE CONDITIONS INSISTED ON BY THE ALLIES HE DEPARTED INDEED FROM HIS DEMAND OF BURGUNDY AS THE RANSOM OF THE FRENCH PRINCES BUT HE REQUIRED PREVIOUSLY TO THEIR LIBERTY
7392-105664-0039 THAT FRANCIS SHOULD EVACUATE GENOA AND ALL THE FORTRESSES HELD BY HIM IN ITALY AND HE DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF BRINGING SFORZA TO A TRIAL AND CONFISCATING THE DUCHY OF MILAN ON ACCOUNT OF HIS PRETENDED TREASON
7392-105664-0040 THE ENGLISH AND FRENCH HERALDS THEREFORE ACCORDING TO AGREEMENT DECLARED WAR AGAINST HIM AND SET HIM AT DEFIANCE CHARLES ANSWERED THE ENGLISH HERALD WITH MODERATION BUT TO THE FRENCH
7392-105664-0041 FRANCIS RETALIATED THIS CHALLENGE BY GIVING CHARLES THE LIE AND AFTER DEMANDING SECURITY OF THE FIELD HE OFFERED TO MAINTAIN HIS CAUSE BY SINGLE COMBAT MANY MESSAGES PASSED TO AND FRO BETWEEN THEM
7392-105664-0042 BUT THOUGH BOTH PRINCES WERE UNDOUBTEDLY BRAVE THE INTENDED DUEL NEVER TOOK PLACE THE FRENCH AND SPANIARDS DURING THAT AGE ZEALOUSLY DISPUTED WHICH OF THE MONARCHS INCURRED THE BLAME OF THIS FAILURE
7392-105664-0043 BUT ALL MEN OF MODERATION EVERY WHERE LAMENTED THE POWER OF FORTUNE THAT THE PRINCE THE MORE CANDID GENEROUS AND SINCERE SHOULD BY UNHAPPY INCIDENTS HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO SO CRUEL A SITUATION THAT NOTHING BUT HIS VIOLATION OF TREATY
7392-105664-0044 COULD PRESERVE HIS PEOPLE AND THAT HE MUST EVER AFTER WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO MAKE A PROPER REPLY BEAR TO BE REPROACHED WITH BREACH OF PROMISE BY A RIVAL INFERIOR TO HIM BOTH IN HONOR AND VIRTUE
7392-105664-0045 BUT THOUGH THIS FAMOUS CHALLENGE BETWEEN CHARLES AND FRANCIS HAD NO IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE WITH REGARD TO THESE MONARCHS THEMSELVES IT PRODUCED A CONSIDERABLE ALTERATION ON THE MANNERS OF THE AGE
7392-105664-0046 THE PRACTICE OF CHALLENGES AND DUELS WHICH HAD BEEN PART OF THE ANCIENT BARBAROUS JURISPRUDENCE WHICH WAS STILL PRESERVED ON VERY SOLEMN OCCASIONS AND WHICH WAS SOMETIMES COUNTENANCED BY THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE BEGAN THENCEFORTH
7392-105664-0047 TO PREVAIL IN THE MOST TRIVIAL INCIDENTS AND MEN ON ANY AFFRONT OR INJURY THOUGHT THEMSELVES ENTITLED OR EVEN REQUIRED IN HONOR TO TAKE REVENGE ON THEIR ENEMIES BY OPENLY VINDICATING THEIR RIGHT IN SINGLE COMBAT
7392-105664-0048 THESE ABSURD THOUGH GENEROUS MAXIMS SHED MUCH OF THEE BEST BLOOD IN CHRISTENDOM DURING MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES
