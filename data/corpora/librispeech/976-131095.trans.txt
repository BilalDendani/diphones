976-131095-0000 THE HAMADRYADS WERE WOOD NYMPHS POMONA WAS OF THIS CLASS AND NO ONE EXCELLED HER IN LOVE OF THE GARDEN AND THE CULTURE OF FRUIT SHE CARED NOT FOR FORESTS AND RIVERS BUT LOVED THE CULTIVATED COUNTRY
976-131095-0001 AND TREES THAT BEAR DELICIOUS APPLES HER RIGHT HAND BORE FOR ITS WEAPON NOT A JAVELIN BUT A PRUNING KNIFE ARMED WITH THIS SHE BUSIED HERSELF AT ONE TIME TO REPRESS THE TOO LUXURIANT GROWTHS
976-131095-0002 AND LED STREAMS OF WATER BY THEM THAT THE THIRSTY ROOTS MIGHT DRINK THIS OCCUPATION WAS HER PURSUIT HER PASSION AND SHE WAS FREE FROM THAT WHICH VENUS INSPIRES SHE WAS NOT WITHOUT FEAR OF THE COUNTRY PEOPLE
976-131095-0003 AND KEPT HER ORCHARD LOCKED AND ALLOWED NOT MEN TO ENTER THE FAUNS AND SATYRS WOULD HAVE GIVEN ALL THEY POSSESSED TO WIN HER AND SO WOULD OLD SYLVANUS WHO LOOKS YOUNG FOR HIS YEARS AND PAN WHO WEARS A GARLAND OF PINE LEAVES AROUND HIS HEAD
976-131095-0004 BUT VERTUMNUS LOVED HER BEST OF ALL YET HE SPED NO BETTER THAN THE REST O HOW OFTEN IN THE DISGUISE OF A REAPER DID HE BRING HER CORN IN A BASKET AND LOOKED THE VERY IMAGE OF A REAPER WITH A HAY BAND TIED ROUND HIM
976-131095-0005 ONE WOULD THINK HE HAD JUST COME FROM TURNING OVER THE GRASS SOMETIMES HE WOULD HAVE AN OX GOAD IN HIS HAND AND YOU WOULD HAVE SAID HE HAD JUST UNYOKED HIS WEARY OXEN NOW HE BORE A PRUNING HOOK AND PERSONATED A VINE DRESSER AND AGAIN WITH A LADDER ON HIS SHOULDER
976-131095-0006 AND FED HIS PASSION WITH THE SIGHT OF HER ONE DAY HE CAME IN THE GUISE OF AN OLD WOMAN HER GRAY HAIR SURMOUNTED WITH A CAP AND A STAFF IN HER HAND SHE ENTERED THE GARDEN AND ADMIRED THE FRUIT IT DOES YOU CREDIT MY DEAR
976-131095-0007 SHE PRAISED THE TREE AND ITS ASSOCIATED VINE EQUALLY BUT SAID SHE IF THE TREE STOOD ALONE AND HAD NO VINE CLINGING TO IT IT WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO ATTRACT OR OFFER US BUT ITS USELESS LEAVES
976-131095-0008 AND WANT TO MAKE A GOOD ALLIANCE AND WILL LET AN OLD WOMAN ADVISE YOU WHO LOVES YOU BETTER THAN YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF DISMISS ALL THE REST AND ACCEPT VERTUMNUS ON MY RECOMMENDATION
976-131095-0009 I KNOW HIM AS WELL AS HE KNOWS HIMSELF HE IS NOT A WANDERING DEITY BUT BELONGS TO THESE MOUNTAINS NOR IS HE LIKE TOO MANY OF THE LOVERS NOWADAYS WHO LOVE ANY ONE THEY HAPPEN TO SEE HE LOVES YOU AND YOU ONLY
976-131095-0010 REMEMBER THAT THE GODS PUNISH CRUELTY AND THAT VENUS HATES A HARD HEART AND WILL VISIT SUCH OFFENCES SOONER OR LATER TO PROVE THIS LET ME TELL YOU A STORY WHICH IS WELL KNOWN IN CYPRUS TO BE A FACT
976-131095-0011 AND I HOPE IT WILL HAVE THE EFFECT TO MAKE YOU MORE MERCIFUL IPHIS WAS A YOUNG MAN OF HUMBLE PARENTAGE WHO SAW AND LOVED ANAXARETE A
976-131095-0012 HE STRUGGLED LONG WITH HIS PASSION BUT WHEN HE FOUND HE COULD NOT SUBDUE IT HE CAME A SUPPLIANT TO HER MANSION FIRST HE TOLD HIS PASSION TO HER NURSE AND BEGGED HER AS SHE LOVED HER FOSTER CHILD TO FAVOR HIS SUIT
976-131095-0013 AND THEN HE TRIED TO WIN HER DOMESTICS TO HIS SIDE SOMETIMES HE COMMITTED HIS VOWS TO WRITTEN TABLETS AND OFTEN HUNG AT HER DOOR GARLANDS WHICH HE HAD MOISTENED WITH HIS TEARS HE STRETCHED HIMSELF ON HER THRESHOLD
976-131095-0014 SHE MOCKED AND LAUGHED AT HIM ADDING CRUEL WORDS TO HER UNGENTLE TREATMENT AND GAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST GLEAM OF HOPE IPHIS COULD NOT ANY LONGER ENDURE THE TORMENTS OF HOPELESS LOVE AND STANDING BEFORE HER DOORS HE SPAKE THESE LAST WORDS
976-131095-0015 THIS AT LEAST I CAN DO TO GRATIFY YOU AND FORCE YOU TO PRAISE ME AND THUS SHALL I PROVE THAT THE LOVE OF YOU LEFT ME BUT WITH LIFE NOR WILL I LEAVE IT TO RUMOR TO TELL YOU OF MY DEATH I WILL COME MYSELF AND YOU SHALL SEE ME DIE

976-131095-0017 AND ADD THOSE YEARS TO MY FAME WHICH YOU HAVE REFT FROM MY LIFE THUS HE SAID AND TURNING HIS PALE FACE AND WEEPING EYES TOWARDS HER MANSION
976-131095-0018 AND THE SOUND WAS AS THE SOUND OF A GROAN THE SERVANTS OPENED THE DOOR AND FOUND HIM DEAD AND WITH EXCLAMATIONS OF PITY RAISED HIM AND CARRIED HIM HOME TO HIS MOTHER FOR HIS FATHER WAS NOT LIVING
976-131095-0019 SHE RECEIVED THE DEAD BODY OF HER SON AND FOLDED THE COLD FORM TO HER BOSOM WHILE SHE POURED FORTH THE SAD WORDS WHICH BEREAVED MOTHERS UTTER THE MOURNFUL FUNERAL PASSED THROUGH THE TOWN AND THE PALE CORPSE WAS BORNE ON A BIER
