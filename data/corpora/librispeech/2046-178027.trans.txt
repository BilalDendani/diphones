2046-178027-0000 AND INTRIGUES AS USUAL ONLY IN THE VERY HIGHEST CIRCLES WERE ATTEMPTS MADE TO KEEP IN MIND THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE ACTUAL POSITION STORIES WERE WHISPERED OF HOW DIFFERENTLY THE TWO EMPRESSES BEHAVED IN THESE DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES THE EMPRESS MARYA CONCERNED FOR THE WELFARE OF THE CHARITABLE AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS UNDER HER PATRONAGE
2046-178027-0001 AND THE THINGS BELONGING TO THESE INSTITUTIONS HAD ALREADY BEEN PACKED UP THE EMPRESS ELISABETH HOWEVER WHEN ASKED WHAT INSTRUCTIONS SHE WOULD BE PLEASED TO GIVE WITH HER CHARACTERISTIC RUSSIAN PATRIOTISM HAD REPLIED THAT SHE COULD GIVE NO DIRECTIONS ABOUT STATE INSTITUTIONS FOR THAT WAS THE AFFAIR OF THE SOVEREIGN
2046-178027-0002 BUT AS FAR AS SHE PERSONALLY WAS CONCERNED SHE WOULD BE THE LAST TO QUIT PETERSBURG AT ANNA PAVLOVNA'S ON THE TWENTY SIXTH OF AUGUST THE VERY DAY OF THE BATTLE OF BORODINO THERE WAS A SOIREE THE CHIEF FEATURE OF WHICH WAS TO BE THE READING OF A LETTER FROM HIS LORDSHIP THE BISHOP
2046-178027-0003 IT WAS REGARDED AS A MODEL OF ECCLESIASTICAL PATRIOTIC ELOQUENCE
2046-178027-0004 ALTERNATING BETWEEN A DESPAIRING WAIL AND A TENDER MURMUR
2046-178027-0005 THIS READING AS WAS ALWAYS THE CASE AT ANNA PAVLOVNA'S SOIREES HAD A POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE THAT EVENING SHE EXPECTED SEVERAL IMPORTANT PERSONAGES WHO HAD TO BE MADE ASHAMED OF THEIR VISITS TO THE FRENCH THEATER AND AROUSED TO A PATRIOTIC TEMPER
2046-178027-0006 A GOOD MANY PEOPLE HAD ALREADY ARRIVED BUT ANNA PAVLOVNA NOT YET SEEING ALL THOSE WHOM SHE WANTED IN HER DRAWING ROOM DID NOT LET THE READING BEGIN BUT WOUND UP THE SPRINGS OF A GENERAL CONVERSATION
2046-178027-0007 THE NEWS OF THE DAY IN PETERSBURG WAS THE ILLNESS OF COUNTESS BEZUKHOVA SHE HAD FALLEN ILL UNEXPECTEDLY A FEW DAYS PREVIOUSLY HAD MISSED SEVERAL GATHERINGS OF WHICH SHE WAS USUALLY ORNAMENT
2046-178027-0008 AND INSTEAD OF THE CELEBRATED PETERSBURG DOCTORS WHO USUALLY ATTENDED HER HAD ENTRUSTED HERSELF TO SOME ITALIAN DOCTOR WHO WAS TREATING HER IN SOME NEW AND UNUSUAL WAY
2046-178027-0009 AND THAT THE ITALIAN'S CURE CONSISTED IN REMOVING SUCH INCONVENIENCE BUT IN ANNA PAVLOVNA'S PRESENCE NO ONE DARED TO THINK OF THIS OR EVEN APPEAR TO KNOW IT THEY SAY THE POOR COUNTESS IS VERY ILL THE DOCTOR SAYS IT IS ANGINA PECTORIS ANGINA OH THAT'S A TERRIBLE ILLNESS
2046-178027-0010 AND THE WORD ANGINA WAS REPEATED WITH GREAT SATISFACTION THE COUNT IS PATHETIC THEY SAY HE CRIED LIKE A CHILD WHEN THE DOCTOR TOLD HIM THE CASE WAS DANGEROUS OH IT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE LOSS SHE IS AN ENCHANTING WOMAN YOU ARE SPEAKING OF THE POOR COUNTESS SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA COMING UP JUST THEN
2046-178027-0011 I SENT TO ASK FOR NEWS AND HEAR THAT SHE IS A LITTLE BETTER OH SHE IS CERTAINLY THE MOST CHARMING WOMAN IN THE WORLD SHE WENT ON WITH A SMILE AT HER OWN ENTHUSIASM
2046-178027-0012 SHE IS VERY UNFORTUNATE ADDED ANNA PAVLOVNA
2046-178027-0013 YOUR INFORMATION MAY BE BETTER THAN MINE ANNA PAVLOVNA SUDDENLY AND VENOMOUSLY RETORTED ON THE INEXPERIENCED YOUNG MAN
2046-178027-0014 HE IS PRIVATE PHYSICIAN TO THE QUEEN OF SPAIN AND HAVING THUS DEMOLISHED THE YOUNG MAN ANNA PAVLOVNA TURNED TO ANOTHER GROUP WHERE BILIBIN
2046-178027-0015 WAS TALKING ABOUT THE AUSTRIANS HAVING WRINKLED UP HIS FACE HE WAS EVIDENTLY PREPARING TO SMOOTH IT OUT AGAIN AND UTTER ONE OF HIS MOTS I THINK IT IS DELIGHTFUL HE SAID REFERRING TO A DIPLOMATIC NOTE THAT HAD BEEN SENT TO VIENNA WITH SOME AUSTRIAN BANNERS CAPTURED FROM THE FRENCH BY WITTGENSTEIN
2046-178027-0016 WHAT WHAT'S THAT ASKED ANNA PAVLOVNA SECURING SILENCE FOR THE MOT WHICH SHE HAD HEARD BEFORE
2046-178027-0017 FRIENDLY BANNERS GONE ASTRAY AND FOUND ON A WRONG PATH AND HIS BROW BECAME SMOOTH AGAIN CHARMING CHARMING OBSERVED PRINCE VASILI THE PATH TO WARSAW PERHAPS PRINCE HIPPOLYTE REMARKED LOUDLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY EVERYBODY LOOKED AT HIM UNDERSTANDING WHAT HE MEANT
2046-178027-0018 PRINCE HIPPOLYTE HIMSELF GLANCED AROUND WITH AMUSED SURPRISE HE KNEW NO MORE THAN THE OTHERS WHAT HIS WORDS MEANT DURING HIS DIPLOMATIC CAREER HE HAD MORE THAN ONCE NOTICED THAT SUCH UTTERANCES WERE RECEIVED AS VERY WITTY AND AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY HE UTTERED IN THAT WAY
2046-178027-0019 THE FIRST WORDS THAT ENTERED HIS HEAD IT MAY TURN OUT VERY WELL HE THOUGHT BUT IF NOT
2046-178027-0020 BUT NO ONE SAID ANYTHING MOSCOW OUR ANCIENT CAPITAL THE NEW JERUSALEM RECEIVES HER CHRIST HE PLACED A SUDDEN EMPHASIS ON THE WORD HER AS A MOTHER RECEIVES HER ZEALOUS SONS INTO HER ARMS
2046-178027-0021 AND THROUGH THE GATHERING MISTS FORESEEING THE BRILLIANT GLORY OF THY RULE SINGS IN EXULTATION HOSANNA BLESSED IS HE THAT COMETH
2046-178027-0022 BILIBIN ATTENTIVELY EXAMINED HIS NAILS AND MANY OF THOSE PRESENT APPEARED INTIMIDATED AS IF ASKING IN WHAT THEY WERE TO BLAME ANNA PAVLOVNA WHISPERED THE NEXT WORDS IN ADVANCE LIKE AN OLD WOMAN MUTTERING THE PRAYER AT COMMUNION LET THE BOLD AND INSOLENT GOLIATH SHE WHISPERED
2046-178027-0023 LET THE BOLD AND INSOLENT GOLIATH FROM THE BORDERS OF FRANCE ENCOMPASS THE REALMS OF RUSSIA WITH DEATH BEARING TERRORS
2046-178027-0024 SHALL SUDDENLY SMITE HIS HEAD IN HIS BLOODTHIRSTY PRIDE THIS ICON OF THE VENERABLE SERGIUS THE SERVANT OF GOD AND ZEALOUS CHAMPION OF OLD OF OUR COUNTRY'S WEAL IS OFFERED TO YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY
2046-178027-0025 I GRIEVE THAT MY WANING STRENGTH PREVENTS REJOICING IN THE SIGHT OF YOUR MOST GRACIOUS PRESENCE
