6006-57831-0000 THIS BATTLE WAS NOTEWORTHY IN EMPLOYING THE CAVALRY IN AN OPEN CHARGE ACROSS THE PLAINS AGAINST THE DERVISH INFANTRY IT WAS JUST SUCH A CHARGE AS A SKILLED HORSEMAN SUCH AS HAIG WOULD KEENLY ENJOY DESPITE THE DANGER WINSTON CHURCHILL THE BRITISH MINISTER
6006-57831-0001 IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE TO MISS SUCH A TARGET AT SUCH A RANGE HORSES AND MEN FELL AT ONCE THE ONLY COURSE WAS PLAIN AND WELCOME TO ALL THE COLONEL NEARER THAN HIS REGIMENT
6006-57831-0002 HE ORDERED RIGHT WHEEL INTO LINE TO BE SOUNDED THE TRUMPET JERKED OUT A SHRILL NOTE
6006-57831-0003 ON THE INSTANT THE TROOPS SWUNG ROUND AND LOCKED UP INTO A LONG GALLOPING LINE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YARDS AWAY THE DARK BLUE MEN WERE FIRING MADLY IN A THIN FILM OF LIGHT BLUE SMOKE
6006-57831-0004 THEIR BULLETS STRUCK THE HARD GRAVEL INTO THE AIR AND THE TROOPERS TO SHIELD THEIR FACES FROM THE STINGING DUST BOWED THEIR HELMETS FORWARD LIKE THE CUIRASSIERS AT WATERLOO THE PACE WAS FAST AND THE DISTANCE SHORT YET BEFORE IT WAS HALF COVERED THE WHOLE ASPECT OF THE AFFAIR CHANGED
6006-57831-0005 AND FROM IT THERE SPRANG WITH THE SUDDENNESS OF A PANTOMIME EFFECT AND A HIGH PITCHED YELL A DENSE WHITE MASS OF MEN NEARLY AS LONG AS OUR FRONT AND ABOUT TWELVE DEEP A SCORE OF HORSEMEN AND A DOZEN BRIGHT FLAGS ROSE AS IF BY MAGIC FROM THE EARTH
6006-57831-0006 THE LANCERS ACKNOWLEDGED THE APPARITION ONLY BY AN INCREASE OF PACE IN SUCH A MELEE AS THEN FOLLOWED THAT TROOPER WAS LUCKY INDEED WHO ESCAPED WITHOUT A SCRATCH AS A RESULT OF HIS BRAVERY AT ATBARA AND KHARTOUM HAIG'S NAME WAS MENTIONED IN THE OFFICIAL DESPATCHES
6006-57831-0007 IT IS PROBABLE HOWEVER THAT LITTLE MORE WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARD OF HIM HAD NOT THE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR BROKEN OUT SOON AFTER IT IS THE LOT OF MILITARY MEN TO VEGETATE IN DAYS OF PEACE THEY LIVE UPON ACTION HAIG WAS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE
6006-57831-0008 HE WELCOMED NEW FIELDS HE WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA AS AIDE AND RIGHT HAND MAN TO SIR JOHN FRENCH THE GENERAL WHOM HE WAS TO SUCCEED IN LATER YEARS ON THE BATTLEFIELDS OF FRANCE IN THIS WAR HAIG IS NOT CREDITED WITH MANY PERSONAL EXPLOITS
6006-57831-0009 HIS WAS ESSENTIALLY A THINKING PART YET HE SERVED AS CHIEF OF STAFF IN A SERIES OF MINOR BUT IMPORTANT OPERATIONS ABOUT COLESBURG
6006-57831-0010 AS USUAL HAIG PINNED HIS FAITH UPON THE CAVALRY ALL HIS LIFE HE HAD MADE A CLOSE STUDY OF THIS ARM OF THE SERVICE AND WAS OF OPINION THAT IT WAS NOT UTILIZED IN MODERN WARFARE NEARLY SO MUCH AS IT SHOULD BE HE WAS A WARM ADMIRER OF THE AMERICAN OFFICER
6006-57831-0011 J E B STUART THE CONFEDERATE GENERAL WHOSE DASHING TACTICS TURNED THE SCALE IN SO MANY ENCOUNTERS NOW HE TRIED THE SAME STRATEGY IN THE OPERATIONS AROUND COLESBURG AND PAVED THE WAY FOR LATER VICTORY
6006-57831-0012 HAIG SOMEWHAT RESEMBLED ANOTHER SOUTHERN LEADER STONEWALL JACKSON IN HIS PIETY IT WAS NOT OSTENTATIOUS BUT SIMPLY PART AND PARCEL OF THE MAN DUE TO HIS PRESBYTERIAN TRAINING HAIG DID NOT SWEAR OR GAMBLE OR DANCE ALL NIGHT
6006-57831-0013 HE WAS MORE APT TO BE FOUND IN HIS TENT WHEN OFF DUTY EITHER READING OR WRITING THEY TELL OF HIM THAT ONE DAY AT THE OFFICERS MESS AFTER A PARTICULARLY LIVELY BRUSH WITH THE BOERS THE QUARTERMASTER ASKED HIM IF HE HAD LOST ANYTHING
6006-57831-0014 YES REPLIED HAIG SOLEMNLY MY BIBLE NOT ONCE DID HIS COUNTENANCE RELAX ITS GRAVITY AS HE MET THE GRINNING FACES ACROSS THE TABLE BUT DESPITE THEIR CHAFFING THERE WAS NOT A MAN THERE WHO DID NOT RESPECT THE COURAGE OF HIS CONVICTIONS
6006-57831-0015 NO LESS THAN THE BRAVERY OF THE MAN HIMSELF ALMOST DAILY HE RISKED HIS LIFE IN THESE CAVALRY OPERATIONS UNTIL THE HAIG LUCK BECAME A WATCHWORD THE END OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR FOUND HAIG PROMOTED TO ACTING ADJUTANT GENERAL OF THE CAVALRY
6006-57831-0016 ONE RESULT OF THIS VISIT WAS A LETTER WHICH SHOWED HIM POSSESSED WITH WONDERFUL POWERS OF ANALYSIS AND FORESIGHT HE PRACTICALLY PREDICTED THE WAR THAT WAS TO COME HE SUMMED UP HIS OBSERVATIONS IN A LONG LETTER TO A FRIEND WHICH IN THE LIGHT OF EVENTS OF THE WAR IS LITTLE SHORT OF UNCANNY
6006-57831-0017 IT GAVE THE GERMAN PLAN WITH A MASTERY OF DETAIL SHREWD PROPHECY AND EARNEST WARNING THE FUTURE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE BRITISH ARMIES IN FRANCE WAS CONVINCED OF THE CERTAINTY OF THE CONFLICT AND BESOUGHT THE AUTHORITIES TO MAKE BETTER PREPARATION BUT HIS WARNINGS FELL UPON DEAF EARS
6006-57831-0018 IT REQUIRED THIRTEEN YEARS TO DEMONSTRATE THE TRUTH OF HAIG'S PREDICTIONS AND THEN THE BLOW FELL THE KAISER VIEWED HIS STRONG HOSTS AND BOASTED THAT HE WOULD SOON WIPE OUT ENGLAND'S CONTEMPTIBLE LITTLE ARMY HE VERY NEARLY DID SO AND WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE SUCCEEDED
6006-57831-0019 HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE FIGHTING SPIRIT OF SUCH MEN AS HAIG DURING THE INTERVENING YEARS SINCE THE SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGN HE HAD RISEN BY FAIRLY RAPID STAGES TO INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE CAVALRY IN INDIA A SITUATION WHICH HE HANDLED WITH GREAT SKILL FOR THREE YEARS
6006-57831-0020 THEN MAJOR GENERAL AND LIEUTENANT GENERAL AT THE OUTBREAK OF THE WORLD WAR HE WAS HURRIEDLY SENT TO FRANCE UNDER THE COMMAND OF SIR JOHN FRENCH HIS OLD LEADER IN AFRICA FRENCH WAS GENEROSITY ITSELF IN HIS PRAISE OF HAIG IN THESE EARLY DAYS OF DISASTER
6006-57831-0021 WAS OF SO SKILFUL BOLD AND DECISIVE A CHARACTER THAT HE GAINED POSITIONS WHICH ALONE HAVE ENABLED ME TO MAINTAIN MY POSITION FOR MORE THAN THREE WEEKS OF VERY SEVERE FIGHTING ON THE NORTH BANK OF THE RIVER
6006-57831-0022 THE CHIEF HONORS OF VICTORY WERE AGAIN AWARDED TO HIM THROUGHOUT THIS TRYING PERIOD SIR DOUGLAS HAIG AIDED BY HIS DIVISIONAL COMMANDERS AND HIS BRIGADE COMMANDERS HELD THE LINE WITH MARVELOUS TENACITY AND UNDAUNTED COURAGE
6006-57831-0023 AGAIN AND AGAIN THE GENEROUS FRENCH PAYS TRIBUTE TO HIS FRIEND WHICH WHILE DESERVED REFLECTS NO LESS HONOR UPON THE SPEAKER HE WAS BIG ENOUGH TO SHARE HONOR IT IS NOT STRANGE THEREFORE WHEN FRENCH WAS SUPERSEDED FOR STRATEGIC REASONS
6006-57831-0024 THAT HAIG SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE CHIEF COMMAND THE APPOINTMENT HOWEVER LEFT MOST OF THE WORLD FRANKLY AMAZED HAIG HAD COME FORWARD SO QUIETLY THAT FEW SAVE THOSE IN OFFICIAL CIRCLES KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM IT WAS NEVERTHELESS BUT A MATTER OF WEEKS POSSIBLY DAYS
6006-57831-0025 BEFORE A QUIET CONFIDENCE BORN OF THE MAN HIMSELF WAS MANIFEST EVERYWHERE ONE WAR CORRESPONDENT WHO VISITED HEADQUARTERS IN THE MIDST OF THE WAR'S TURMOIL THUS DESCRIBES HIS VISIT THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF IS STRONGLY SUGGESTIVE OF HIS CONDUCT OF THE WAR
6006-57831-0026 BEFORE WAR BECAME A THING OF PRECISE SCIENCE THE HEADQUARTERS OF AN ARMY HEAD SEETHED WITH ALL THE PICTURESQUE DETAILS SO COMMON TO PICTURES OF MARTIAL LIFE COURIERS MOUNTED ON FOAM FLECKED HORSES DASHED TO AND FRO THE AIR WAS VIBRANT WITH ACTION
6006-57831-0027 ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT ALTHOUGH ARMY UNITS HAVE RISEN FROM THOUSANDS TO MILLIONS OF MEN AND FIELDS OF OPERATIONS STRETCH FROM SEA TO SEA AND MORE AMMUNITION IS EXPENDED IN A SINGLE ENGAGEMENT THAN WAS EMPLOYED IN ENTIRE WARS OF OTHER DAYS
6006-57831-0028 ABSOLUTE SERENITY PREVAILS IT IS ONLY WHEN YOUR IMAGINATION CONJURES UP THE PICTURE OF FLAME AND FURY THAT LIES BEYOND THE HORIZON LINE THAT YOU GET A THRILL AN OCCASIONAL MOTORCAR DRIVEN BY A SOLDIER CHAUFFEUR CHUGS UP THE GRAVEL ROAD TO THE CHATEAU
6006-57831-0029 HIS CHEST IS BROAD AND DEEP YET SCARCELY BROAD ENOUGH FOR THE ROWS OF SERVICE AND ORDER RIBBONS THAT PLANT A MASS OF COLOR AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF KHAKI INTO EVERY DETAIL OF DAILY LIFE AT GENERAL HEADQUARTERS THE COMMANDER'S CHARACTER IS IMPRESSED
6006-57831-0030 AFTER LUNCH FOR EXAMPLE HE SPENDS AN HOUR ALONE AND IN THIS PERIOD OF MEDITATION THE WHOLE FATEFUL PANORAMA OF THE WAR PASSES BEFORE HIM WHEN IT IS OVER THE WIRES SPLUTTER AND THE FIERCE LIFE OF THE COMING NIGHT THE ARMY DOES NOT BEGIN TO FIGHT UNTIL MOST PEOPLE GO TO SLEEP
6006-57831-0031 THROUGHOUT THE FOUR LONG YEARS OF WAR HE FACED THE ENEMY WITH A CALM COURAGE WHICH IF IT EVER WAVERED GAVE NO OUTWARD SIGN AND THAT IS ONE REASON WHY THE LITTLE CONTEMPTIBLES GREW AND GREW
