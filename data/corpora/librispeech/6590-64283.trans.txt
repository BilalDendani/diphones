6590-64283-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT GODFREY AND LETTY
6590-64283-0001 WHEN GODFREY ARRIVED IN LONDON THE WIND WAS COLD THE PAVEMENTS WERE COLD THE HOUSES SEEMED TO BE NOT ONLY COLD BUT FEELING IT THE VERY DUST THAT BLOW IN HIS FACE WAS COLD NOW COLD IS A POWERFUL ALLY OF THE COMMONPLACE
6590-64283-0002 AND IMAGINATION THEREFORE WAS NOT VERY BUSY IN THE BOSOM OF GODFREY WARDOUR AS HE WENT TO FIND LETTY HELMER WHICH WAS JUST AS WELL IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES HE WAS COOL TO THE VERY HEART WHEN HE WALKED UP TO THE DOOR INDICATED BY MARY AND RUNG THE BELL MISSUS HELMER WAS AT HOME
6590-64283-0003 WOULD HE WALK UP STAIRS IT WAS NOT A HOUSE OF CEREMONIES HE WAS SHOWN UP AND UP AND INTO THE ROOM WHERE SHE SAT WITHOUT A WORD CARRIED BEFORE TO PREPARE HER FOR HIS VISIT IT WAS SO DARK THAT HE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE FIGURE OF ONE AT WORK BY A TABLE
6590-64283-0004 ON WHICH STOOD A SINGLE CANDLE THERE WAS BUT A SPARK OF FIRE IN THE DREARY GRATE AND LETTY WAS COLDER THAN ANY ONE COULD KNOW FOR SHE WAS AT THE MOMENT MAKING DOWN THE LAST WOOLLY GARMENT SHE HAD IN THE VAIN HOPE OF WARMING HER BABY
6590-64283-0005 SHE LOOKED UP SHE HAD THOUGHT IT WAS THE LANDLADY
6590-64283-0006 SHE GAZED FOR A MOMENT IN BEWILDERMENT SAW WHO IT WAS AND JUMPED UP HALF FRIGHTENED HALF READY TO GO WILD WITH JOY ALL THE MEMORIES OF GODFREY RUSHED IN A CONFUSED HEAP UPON HER AND OVERWHELMED HER
6590-64283-0007 SHE RAN TO HIM AND THE SAME MOMENT WAS IN HIS ARMS WITH HER HEAD ON HIS SHOULDER WEEPING TEARS OF SUCH GLADNESS AS SHE HAD NOT KNOWN SINCE THE FIRST WEEK OF HER MARRIAGE NEITHER SPOKE FOR SOME TIME LETTY COULD NOT BECAUSE SHE WAS CRYING
6590-64283-0008 AND GODFREY WOULD NOT BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO CRY THOSE FEW MOMENTS WERE PURE SIMPLE HAPPINESS TO BOTH OF THEM TO LETTY BECAUSE SHE HAD LOVED HIM FROM CHILDHOOD AND HOPED THAT ALL WAS TO BE AS OF OLD BETWEEN THEM
6590-64283-0009 TO GODFREY BECAUSE FOR THE MOMENT HE HAD FORGOTTEN HIMSELF AND HAD NEITHER THOUGHT OF INJURY NOR HOPE OF LOVE REMEMBERING ONLY THE OLD DAYS AND THE LETTY THAT USED TO BE IT MAY SEEM STRANGE THAT
6590-64283-0010 HAVING NEVER ONCE EMBRACED HER ALL THE TIME THEY LIVED TOGETHER HE SHOULD DO SO NOW BUT LETTY'S LOVE WOULD ANY TIME HAVE RESPONDED TO THE LEAST SHOW OF AFFECTION AND WHEN AT THE SIGHT OF HIS FACE INTO WHICH MEMORY HAD CALLED UP ALL HIS TENDERNESS SHE RUSHED INTO HIS ARMS
6590-64283-0011 HOW COULD HE HELP KISSING HER THE PITY WAS THAT HE HAD NOT KISSED HER LONG BEFORE OR WAS IT A PITY I THINK NOT BUT THE EMBRACE COULD NOT BE A LONG ONE GODFREY WAS THE FIRST TO RELAX ITS STRAIN AND LETTY RESPONDED WITH AN INSTANT COLLAPSE
6590-64283-0012 AND SAD WITH SUCH BIG EYES AND THE BONE TIGHTENING THE SKIN UPON HER FOREHEAD HE FELT AS IF SHE WERE A SPECTRE LETTY NOT THE LETTY HE HAD LOVED GLANCING UP SHE CAUGHT HIS TROUBLED GAZE
6590-64283-0013 DO NOT LOOK AT ME SO OR I SHALL CRY AGAIN YOU KNOW YOU NEVER LIKED TO SEE ME CRY MY
6590-64283-0014 IF HE HAD NOT KEPT IT LOWER THAN NATURAL WOULD HAVE BROKEN YOU ARE SUFFERING
6590-64283-0015 I AM ONLY SO GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN COUSIN GODFREY SHE SAT ON THE EDGE OF THE SOFA AND HAD PUT HER OPEN HANDS PALM TO PALM BETWEEN HER KNEES IN A CHILDISH WAY LOOKING LIKE ONE CHIDDEN
6590-64283-0016 BUT WAS READY TO ENDURE FOR A MOMENT GODFREY SAT GAZING AT HER WITH TROUBLED HEART AND TROUBLED LOOKS THEN BETWEEN HIS TEETH MUTTERED DAMN THE RASCAL
6590-64283-0017 SCARED YET READY TO DEFEND HER HANDS WERE NOW CLINCHED ONE ON EACH SIDE OF HER SHE WAS POKING THE LITTLE FISTS INTO THE SQUAB OF THE SOFA COUSIN GODFREY SHE CRIED IF YOU MEAN TOM YOU MUST NOT YOU MUST NOT
6590-64283-0018 I WILL GO AWAY IF YOU SPEAK A WORD AGAINST HIM I WILL I WILL I MUST YOU KNOW GODFREY MADE NO REPLY NEITHER APOLOGIZED NOR SOUGHT TO COVER WHY CHILD HE SAID AT LAST
6590-64283-0019 SHE HAD NOT BEEN AT ALL PITYING HERSELF BUT SUCH AN UTTERANCE FROM THE MAN SHE LOVED LIKE AN ELDER BROTHER SO WROUGHT UPON HER ENFEEBLED CONDITION THAT SHE BROKE INTO A CRY SHE STROVE TO SUPPRESS HER EMOTION
6590-64283-0020 IN HER AGONY SHE WOULD HAVE RUSHED FROM THE ROOM HAD NOT GODFREY CAUGHT HER DRAWN HER DOWN BESIDE HIM AND KEPT HER THERE YOU SHALL NOT LEAVE ME HE SAID IN THAT VOICE LETTY HAD ALWAYS BEEN USED TO OBEY
6590-64283-0021 WHO HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW HOW THINGS GO WITH YOU IF I HAVE NOT COME YOU MUST TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT I HAVE NOTHING TO TELL COUSIN GODFREY SHE REPLIED WITH SOME CALMNESS FOR GODFREY'S DECISION HAD ENABLED HER TO CONQUER HERSELF
6590-64283-0022 EXCEPT THAT BABY IS ILL AND LOOKS AS IF HE WOULD NEVER GET BETTER AND IT IS LIKE TO BREAK MY HEART OH HE IS SUCH A DARLING COUSIN GODFREY LET ME SEE HIM SAID GODFREY IN HIS HEART DETESTING THE CHILD
6590-64283-0023 THE VISIBLE SIGN THAT ANOTHER WAS NEARER TO LETTY THAN HE SHE JUMPED UP ALMOST RAN INTO THE NEXT ROOM AND COMING BACK WITH HER LITTLE ONE LAID HIM IN GODFREY'S ARMS THE MOMENT HE FELT THE WEIGHT OF THE LITTLE SAD LOOKING SLEEPING THING
6590-64283-0024 HE GREW HUMAN TOWARD HIM AND SAW IN HIM LETTY AND NOT TOM GOOD GOD THE CHILD IS STARVING TOO HE EXCLAIMED OH NO COUSIN GODFREY CRIED LETTY
6590-64283-0025 HE HAD A FRESH LAID EGG FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND SOME ARROWROOT FOR DINNER AND SOME BREAD AND MILK FOR TEA LONDON MILK SAID GODFREY WELL IT IS NOT LIKE THE MILK IN THE DAIRY AT THORNWICK ADMITTED LETTY
6590-64283-0026 IF HE HAD MILK LIKE THAT HE WOULD SOON BE WELL BUT GODFREY DARED NOT SAY BRING HIM TO THORNWICK HE KNEW HIS MOTHER TOO WELL FOR THAT WHEN WERE YOU ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY HE ASKED
6590-64283-0027 IN A NEGATIVE KIND OF WAY HE WAS STILL NURSING THE BABY NOT SINCE WE WERE MARRIED SHE ANSWERED SADLY YOU SEE POOR TOM CAN'T AFFORD IT NOW GODFREY HAPPENED TO HAVE HEARD FROM THE BEST AUTHORITY
6590-64283-0028 THAT TOM'S MOTHER WAS FAR FROM ILLIBERAL TO HIM MISSUS HELMER ALLOWS HIM SO MUCH A YEAR DOES SHE NOT HE SAID I KNOW HE GETS MONEY FROM HER BUT IT CAN'T BE MUCH SHE ANSWERED
6590-64283-0029 GODFREY'S SUSPICIONS AGAINST TOM INCREASED EVERY MOMENT HE MUST LEARN THE TRUTH HE WOULD HAVE IT IF BY AN EVEN CRUEL EXPERIMENT
6590-64283-0030 THEN SAID WITH ASSUMED CHEERFULNESS WELL LETTY I SUPPOSE FOR THE SAKE OF OLD TIMES YOU WILL GIVE ME SOME DINNER THEN INDEED HER COURAGE GAVE WAY SHE TURNED FROM HIM LAID HER HEAD ON THE END OF THE SOFA
6590-64283-0031 AND SOBBED SO THAT THE ROOM SEEMED TO SHAKE WITH THE CONVULSIONS OF HER GRIEF LETTY SAID GODFREY LAYING HIS HAND ON HER HEAD
6590-64283-0032 I DON'T WANT ANY DINNER IN FACT I DINED LONG AGO BUT YOU WOULD NOT BE OPEN WITH ME AND I WAS FORCED TO FIND OUT FOR MYSELF YOU HAVE NOT ENOUGH TO EAT AND YOU KNOW IT I WILL NOT SAY A WORD ABOUT WHO IS TO BLAME
6590-64283-0033 FOR ANYTHING I KNOW IT MAY BE NO ONE I AM SURE IT IS NOT YOU BUT THIS MUST NOT GO ON SEE I HAVE BROUGHT YOU A LITTLE POCKET BOOK I WILL CALL AGAIN TOMORROW AND YOU WILL TELL ME THEN HOW YOU LIKE IT
6590-64283-0034 HE LAID THE POCKET BOOK ON THE TABLE THERE WAS TEN TIMES AS MUCH IN IT AS EVER LETTY HAD HAD AT ONCE BUT SHE NEVER KNEW WHAT WAS IN IT SHE ROSE WITH INSTANT RESOLVE ALL THE WOMAN IN HER WAKED AT ONCE
6590-64283-0035 SHE FELT THAT A MOMENT WAS COME WHEN SHE MUST BE RESOLUTE OR LOSE HER HOLD ON LIFE COUSIN GODFREY SHE SAID IN A TONE HE SCARCELY RECOGNIZED AS HERS
6590-64283-0036 IF YOU DO NOT TAKE THAT PURSE AWAY I WILL THROW IT IN THE FIRE WITHOUT OPENING IT IF MY HUSBAND CAN NOT GIVE ME ENOUGH TO EAT I CAN STARVE AS WELL AS ANOTHER IF YOU LOVED TOM IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT BUT YOU HATE HIM AND I WILL HAVE NOTHING FROM YOU
6590-64283-0037 TAKE IT AWAY COUSIN GODFREY MORTIFIED HURT MISERABLE GODFREY TOOK THE PURSE AND WITHOUT A WORD WALKED FROM THE ROOM SOMEWHERE DOWN IN HIS SECRET HEART WAS DAWNING AN IDEA OF LETTY
6590-64283-0038 BEYOND ANYTHING HE USED TO THINK OF HER BUT IN THE MEAN TIME HE WAS ONLY BLINDLY AWARE THAT HIS HEART HAD BEEN SHOT THROUGH AND THROUGH NOR WAS THIS THE TIME FOR HIM TO REFLECT THAT UNDER HIS TRAINING LETTY EVEN IF HE HAD MARRIED HER
6590-64283-0039 WOULD NEVER HAVE GROWN TO SUCH DIGNITY IT WAS INDEED ONLY IN THAT MOMENT SHE HAD BECOME CAPABLE OF THE ACTION SHE HAD BEEN GROWING AS NONE NOT MARY STILL LESS HERSELF KNEW UNDER THE HEAVY SNOWS OF AFFLICTION
6590-64283-0040 BUT THE DIGNITY OF HER REFUSAL WAS IN THIS THAT SHE WOULD ACCEPT NOTHING IN WHICH HER HUSBAND HAD AND COULD HAVE NO HUMAN THAT IS NO SPIRITUAL SHARE SHE HAD MARRIED HIM BECAUSE SHE LOVED HIM
6590-64283-0041 NOT WITTINGLY WOULD SHE ALLOW THE FINEST EDGE EVEN OF ANCIENT KINDNESS TO COME BETWEEN HER TOM AND HERSELF TO ACCEPT FROM HER COUSIN GODFREY THE HELP HER HUSBAND OUGHT TO PROVIDE HER WOULD BE TO LET HIM HOWEVER INNOCENTLY STEP INTO HIS PLACE
6590-64283-0042 THERE WAS NO REASONING IN HER RESOLVE IT WAS ALLIED TO THAT SPIRITUAL INSIGHT WHICH IN SIMPLE NATURES AND IN PROPORTION TO THEIR SIMPLICITY APPROACHES OR AMOUNTS TO PROPHECY AS THE PRESENCE OF DEATH WILL SOMETIMES CHANGE EVEN AN ORDINARY MAN TO A PROPHET
6590-64283-0043 SUFFICING TO DIRECT THE DOUBTFUL STEP
6590-64283-0044 THE MOMENT GODFREY WAS OUT OF THE ROOM SHE CAST HERSELF ON THE FLOOR AND SOBBED AS IF HER HEART MUST BREAK BUT HER SOBS WERE TEARLESS
6590-64283-0045 UNSOUGHT CAME THE CONVICTION AND SHE COULD NOT SEND IT AWAY TO THIS HAD SUNK HER LOFTY IDEA OF HER TOM THAT HE WOULD HAVE HAD HER TAKE THE MONEY MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE IN THE ILL HUMORS THAT FOLLOWED A FORCED HILARITY
