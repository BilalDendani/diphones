1647-140649-0003 VENUS WITH EXCESS OF SPLENDOR JUST SETTING IN THE WEST AND THE GREAT SCORPION REARING ITS LENGTH MORE THAN HALF UP IN THE SOUTHEAST AS I CROSS'D LEISURELY FOR AN HOUR IN THE PLEASANT NIGHT SCENE
1647-140649-0004 MY YOUNG FRIEND'S WORDS BROUGHT UP QUITE A STRING OF REMINISCENCES I COMMENCED WHEN I WAS BUT A BOY OF ELEVEN OR TWELVE WRITING SENTIMENTAL BITS FOR THE OLD LONG ISLAND PATRIOT IN BROOKLYN THIS WAS ABOUT EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO
1647-140649-0005 SOON AFTER I HAD A PIECE OR TWO IN GEORGE P MORRIS'S THEN CELEBRATED AND FASHIONABLE MIRROR OF NEW YORK CITY
1647-140649-0006 HOW IT MADE MY HEART DOUBLE BEAT TO SEE MY PIECE ON THE PRETTY WHITE PAPER IN NICE TYPE MY FIRST REAL VENTURE WAS THE LONG ISLANDER IN MY OWN BEAUTIFUL TOWN OF HUNTINGTON IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
1647-140649-0007 I WAS ABOUT TWENTY YEARS OLD I HAD BEEN TEACHING COUNTRY SCHOOL FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF SUFFOLK AND QUEENS COUNTIES BUT LIKED PRINTING HAD BEEN AT IT WHILE A LAD LEARN'D THE TRADE OF COMPOSITOR
1647-140649-0008 AND WAS ENCOURAGED TO START A PAPER IN THE REGION WHERE I WAS BORN I WENT TO NEW YORK BOUGHT A PRESS AND TYPES HIRED SOME LITTLE HELP BUT DID MOST OF THE WORK MYSELF INCLUDING THE PRESS WORK
1647-140649-0009 EVERYTHING SEEM'D TURNING OUT WELL ONLY MY OWN RESTLESSNESS PREVENTED ME GRADUALLY ESTABLISHING A PERMANENT PROPERTY THERE I BOUGHT A GOOD HORSE AND EVERY WEEK WENT ALL ROUND THE COUNTRY SERVING MY PAPERS
1647-140649-0010 DEVOTING ONE DAY AND NIGHT TO IT I NEVER HAD HAPPIER JAUNTS GOING OVER TO SOUTH SIDE TO BABYLON DOWN THE SOUTH ROAD ACROSS TO SMITHTOWN AND COMAC AND BACK HOME THE EXPERIENCES OF THOSE JAUNTS
1647-140649-0011 THE DEAR OLD FASHION'D FARMERS AND THEIR WIVES THE STOPS BY THE HAY FIELDS THE HOSPITALITY NICE DINNERS OCCASIONAL EVENINGS THE GIRLS THE RIDES THROUGH THE BRUSH COME UP IN MY MEMORY TO THIS DAY
1647-140649-0012 I NEXT WENT TO THE AURORA DAILY IN NEW YORK CITY A SORT OF FREE LANCE ALSO WROTE REGULARLY FOR THE TATTLER AN EVENING PAPER WITH THESE AND A LITTLE OUTSIDE WORK I WAS OCCUPIED OFF AND ON
1647-140649-0013 UNTIL I WENT TO EDIT THE BROOKLYN EAGLE WHERE FOR TWO YEARS I HAD ONE OF THE PLEASANTEST SITS OF MY LIFE A GOOD OWNER GOOD PAY AND EASY WORK AND HOURS THE TROUBLES IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BROKE FORTH ABOUT THOSE TIMES
1647-140649-0014 AND I SPLIT OFF WITH THE RADICALS WHICH LED TO ROWS WITH THE BOSS AND THE PARTY AND I LOST MY PLACE BEING NOW OUT OF A JOB I WAS OFFER'D IMPROMPTU
1647-140649-0015 IT HAPPEN'D BETWEEN THE ACTS ONE NIGHT IN THE LOBBY OF THE OLD BROADWAY THEATRE NEAR PEARL STREET NEW YORK CITY A GOOD CHANCE TO GO DOWN TO NEW ORLEANS ON THE STAFF OF THE CRESCENT A DAILY TO BE STARTED THERE WITH PLENTY OF CAPITAL BEHIND IT
1647-140649-0016 ONE OF THE OWNERS WHO WAS NORTH BUYING MATERIAL MET ME WALKING IN THE LOBBY AND THOUGH THAT WAS OUR FIRST ACQUAINTANCE AFTER FIFTEEN MINUTES TALK AND A DRINK
1647-140649-0017 WE MADE A FORMAL BARGAIN AND HE PAID ME TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS DOWN TO BIND THE CONTRACT AND BEAR MY EXPENSES TO NEW ORLEANS
1647-140649-0018 FIRST AS A WEEKLY THEN DAILY PRETTY SOON THE SECESSION WAR BROKE OUT AND I TOO GOT DRAWN IN THE CURRENT SOUTHWARD AND SPENT THE FOLLOWING THREE YEARS THERE AS MEMORANDIZED PRECEDING
1647-140649-0019 I HAVE HAD TO DO ONE TIME OR ANOTHER DURING MY LIFE WITH A LONG LIST OF PAPERS AT DIVERS PLACES SOMETIMES UNDER QUEER CIRCUMSTANCES DURING THE WAR THE HOSPITALS AT WASHINGTON AMONG OTHER MEANS OF AMUSEMENT
1647-140649-0020 PRINTED A LITTLE SHEET AMONG THEMSELVES SURROUNDED BY WOUNDS AND DEATH THE ARMORY SQUARE GAZETTE TO WHICH I CONTRIBUTED THE SAME LONG AFTERWARD CASUALLY TO A PAPER I THINK IT WAS CALL'D THE JIMPLECUTE OUT IN COLORADO
1647-140649-0021 WHERE I STOPP'D AT THE TIME WHEN I WAS IN QUEBEC PROVINCE IN CANADA IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY I WENT INTO THE QUEEREST LITTLE OLD FRENCH PRINTING OFFICE NEAR TADOUSAC
1647-140649-0022 IT WAS FAR MORE PRIMITIVE AND ANCIENT THAN MY CAMDEN FRIEND WILLIAM KURTZ'S PLACE UP ON FEDERAL STREET I REMEMBER AS A YOUNGSTER SEVERAL CHARACTERISTIC OLD PRINTERS OF A KIND HARD TO BE SEEN THESE DAYS
1647-140649-0023 THE GREAT UNREST OF WHICH WE ARE PART MY THOUGHTS WENT FLOATING ON VAST AND MYSTIC CURRENTS AS I SAT TO DAY IN SOLITUDE AND HALF SHADE BY THE CREEK RETURNING MAINLY TO TWO PRINCIPAL CENTRES
1647-140649-0024 ONE OF MY CHERISH'D THEMES FOR A NEVER ACHIEV'D POEM HAS BEEN THE TWO IMPETUSES OF MAN AND THE UNIVERSE
1647-140649-0025 POETRY EVEN MORALS BUT EMOTION
1647-140649-0026 A HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS HENCE THE IMAGINARY DIPPER WILL BE UPSIDE DOWN AND THE STARS WHICH FORM THE BOWL AND HANDLE WILL HAVE CHANGED PLACES THE MISTY NEBULAE ARE MOVING
1647-140649-0027 AND BESIDES ARE WHIRLING AROUND IN GREAT SPIRALS SOME ONE WAY SOME ANOTHER EVERY MOLECULE OF MATTER IN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IS SWINGING TO AND FRO EVERY PARTICLE OF ETHER
1647-140649-0028 WHICH FILLS SPACE IS IN JELLY LIKE VIBRATION LIGHT IS ONE KIND OF MOTION HEAT ANOTHER ELECTRICITY ANOTHER MAGNETISM ANOTHER SOUND ANOTHER EVERY HUMAN SENSE
1647-140649-0029 IS THE RESULT OF MOTION EVERY PERCEPTION EVERY THOUGHT IS BUT MOTION OF THE MOLECULES OF THE BRAIN TRANSLATED BY THAT INCOMPREHENSIBLE THING WE CALL MIND THE PROCESSES OF GROWTH OF EXISTENCE OF DECAY
1647-140649-0030 BY EMERSON'S GRAVE MAY SIXTH
1647-140649-0031 WE STAND BY EMERSON'S NEW MADE GRAVE WITHOUT SADNESS INDEED A SOLEMN JOY AND FAITH ALMOST HAUTEUR OUR SOUL BENISON NO MERE WARRIOR REST THY TASK IS DONE
1647-140649-0032 FOR ONE BEYOND THE WARRIORS OF THE WORLD LIES SURELY SYMBOLL'D HERE A JUST MAN POISED ON HIMSELF ALL LOVING ALL INCLOSING AND SANE AND CLEAR AS THE SUN
1647-140649-0033 NOR DOES IT SEEM SO MUCH EMERSON HIMSELF WE ARE HERE TO HONOR IT IS CONSCIENCE SIMPLICITY CULTURE HUMANITY'S ATTRIBUTES AT THEIR BEST
1647-140649-0034 YET APPLICABLE IF NEED BE TO AVERAGE AFFAIRS AND ELIGIBLE TO ALL SO USED ARE WE TO SUPPOSE A HEROIC DEATH CAN ONLY COME FROM OUT OF BATTLE OR STORM OR MIGHTY PERSONAL CONTEST
1647-140649-0035 OR AMID DRAMATIC INCIDENTS OR DANGER HAVE WE NOT BEEN TAUGHT SO FOR AGES BY ALL THE PLAYS AND POEMS THAT FEW EVEN OF THOSE WHO MOST SYMPATHIZINGLY MOURN EMERSON'S LATE DEPARTURE
1647-140649-0036 WILL FULLY APPRECIATE THE RIPEN'D GRANDEUR OF THAT EVENT WITH ITS PLAY OF CALM AND FITNESS LIKE EVENING LIGHT ON THE SEA
1647-140649-0037 THE CLEAR EYES THE SILENTLY SMILING MOUTH
1647-140649-0038 WITH SO MUCH SPRING AND CHEERINESS AND SUCH AN ABSENCE OF DECREPITUDE THAT EVEN THE TERM VENERABLE HARDLY SEEM'D FITTING PERHAPS THE LIFE NOW ROUNDED AND COMPLETED IN ITS MORTAL DEVELOPMENT
1647-140649-0039 AND WHICH NOTHING CAN CHANGE OR HARM MORE HAS ITS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS HALO NOT IN ITS SPLENDID INTELLECTUAL OR ESTHETIC PRODUCTS BUT AS FORMING IN ITS ENTIRETY ONE OF THE FEW ALAS HOW FEW
1647-140649-0040 OF THE ENTIRE LITERARY CLASS WE CAN SAY AS ABRAHAM LINCOLN AT GETTYSBURG IT IS NOT WE WHO COME TO CONSECRATE THE DEAD WE REVERENTLY COME TO RECEIVE IF SO IT MAY BE
1647-140649-0041 SOME CONSECRATION TO OURSELVES AND DAILY WORK FROM HIM AT PRESENT WRITING PERSONAL A LETTER TO A GERMAN FRIEND EXTRACT
1647-140649-0042 FROM TO DAY I ENTER UPON MY SIXTY FOURTH YEAR
1647-140649-0043 AND WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE I EASILY TIRE AM VERY CLUMSY CANNOT WALK FAR BUT MY SPIRITS ARE FIRST RATE
1647-140649-0044 KEEP UP MY ACTIVITY AND INTEREST IN LIFE PEOPLE PROGRESS AND THE QUESTIONS OF THE DAY ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE TIME I AM QUITE COMFORTABLE WHAT MENTALITY I EVER HAD REMAINS ENTIRELY UNAFFECTED
1647-140649-0045 THOUGH PHYSICALLY I AM A HALF PARALYTIC AND LIKELY TO BE SO LONG AS I LIVE
1647-140649-0046 I HAVE THE MOST DEVOTED AND ARDENT OF FRIENDS AND AFFECTIONATE RELATIVES AND OF ENEMIES I REALLY MAKE NO ACCOUNT AFTER TRYING A CERTAIN BOOK
1647-140649-0047 I TRIED TO READ A BEAUTIFULLY PRINTED AND SCHOLARLY VOLUME ON THE THEORY OF POETRY RECEIVED BY MAIL THIS MORNING FROM ENGLAND BUT GAVE IT UP AT LAST FOR A BAD JOB
1647-140649-0048 HERE ARE SOME CAPRICIOUS PENCILLINGS THAT FOLLOW'D AS I FIND THEM IN MY NOTES IN YOUTH AND MATURITY POEMS ARE CHARGED WITH SUNSHINE AND VARIED POMP OF DAY BUT AS THE SOUL MORE AND MORE TAKES PRECEDENCE
1647-140649-0049 THE SENSUOUS STILL INCLUDED THE DUSK BECOMES THE POET'S ATMOSPHERE I TOO HAVE SOUGHT AND EVER SEEK THE BRILLIANT SUN AND MAKE MY SONGS ACCORDING
1647-140649-0050 BUT AS I GROW OLD THE HALF LIGHTS OF EVENING ARE FAR MORE TO ME THE PLAY OF IMAGINATION WITH THE SENSUOUS OBJECTS OF NATURE FOR SYMBOLS AND FAITH
1647-140649-0051 WITH LOVE AND PRIDE AS THE UNSEEN IMPETUS AND MOVING POWER OF ALL MAKE UP THE CURIOUS CHESS GAME OF A POEM COMMON TEACHERS OR CRITICS ARE ALWAYS ASKING WHAT DOES IT MEAN
1647-140649-0052 SYMPHONY OF FINE MUSICIAN OR SUNSET OR SEA WAVES ROLLING UP THE BEACH WHAT DO THEY MEAN UNDOUBTEDLY IN THE MOST SUBTLE ELUSIVE SENSE THEY MEAN SOMETHING AS LOVE DOES AND RELIGION DOES AND THE BEST POEM
1647-140649-0053 BUT WHO SHALL FATHOM AND DEFINE THOSE MEANINGS I DO NOT INTEND THIS AS A WARRANT FOR WILDNESS AND FRANTIC ESCAPADES BUT TO JUSTIFY THE SOUL'S FREQUENT JOY IN WHAT CANNOT BE DEFINED TO THE INTELLECTUAL PART
1647-140649-0054 AT ITS BEST POETIC LORE IS LIKE WHAT MAY BE HEARD OF CONVERSATION IN THE DUSK FROM SPEAKERS FAR OR HID OF WHICH WE GET ONLY A FEW BROKEN MURMURS WHAT IS NOT GATHER'D IS FAR MORE PERHAPS THE MAIN THING
1647-140649-0055 GRANDEST POETIC PASSAGES ARE ONLY TO BE TAKEN AT FREE REMOVES AS WE SOMETIMES LOOK FOR STARS AT NIGHT NOT BY GAZING DIRECTLY TOWARD THEM BUT OFF ONE SIDE TO A POETIC STUDENT AND FRIEND
1647-140649-0056 I ONLY SEEK TO PUT YOU IN RAPPORT YOUR OWN BRAIN HEART EVOLUTION MUST NOT ONLY UNDERSTAND THE MATTER BUT LARGELY SUPPLY IT FINAL CONFESSIONS
1647-140649-0057 LITERARY TESTS SO DRAW NEAR THEIR END THESE GARRULOUS NOTES THERE HAVE DOUBTLESS OCCURR'D SOME REPETITIONS TECHNICAL ERRORS IN THE CONSECUTIVENESS OF DATES
1647-140649-0058 AND PERHAPS ELSEWHERE FOR IN GATHERING UP WRITING PEREMPTORILY DISPATCHING COPY THIS HOT WEATHER
1647-140649-0059 AND DELAYING NOT THE PRINTERS I HAVE HAD TO HURRY ALONG NO TIME TO SPARE BUT IN THE DEEPEST VERACITY OF ALL IN REFLECTIONS OF OBJECTS SCENES NATURE'S OUTPOURINGS TO MY SENSES AND RECEPTIVITY AS THEY SEEM'D TO ME
1647-140649-0060 IN THE WORK OF GIVING THOSE WHO CARE FOR IT SOME AUTHENTIC GLINTS SPECIMEN DAYS OF MY LIFE AND IN THE BONA FIDE SPIRIT AND RELATIONS FROM AUTHOR TO READER ON ALL THE SUBJECTS DESIGN'D AND AS FAR AS THEY GO
1647-140649-0061 I FEEL TO MAKE UNMITIGATED CLAIMS THE SYNOPSIS OF MY EARLY LIFE LONG ISLAND NEW YORK CITY AND SO FORTH
1647-140649-0062 COMMENCING AT NOON FLUSH AND SO THROUGH THE AFTER PART OF THE DAY I SUPPOSE LED TO SUCH IDEA BY MY OWN LIFE AFTERNOON NOW ARRIVED BUT I SOON FOUND I COULD MOVE AT MORE EASE BY GIVING THE NARRATIVE AT FIRST HAND
1647-140649-0063 NATURE SEEMS TO LOOK ON ALL FIXED UP POETRY AND ART AS SOMETHING ALMOST IMPERTINENT THUS I WENT ON YEARS FOLLOWING VARIOUS SEASONS AND AREAS SPINNING FORTH MY THOUGHT BENEATH THE NIGHT AND STARS
1647-140649-0064 OR AS I WAS CONFINED TO MY ROOM BY HALF SICKNESS OR AT MIDDAY LOOKING OUT UPON THE SEA OR FAR NORTH STEAMING OVER THE SAGUENAY'S BLACK BREAST
1647-140649-0065 HARDLY EVEN THE SEASONS GROUP'D TOGETHER OR ANYTHING CORRECTED
1647-140649-0066 I DARED NOT TRY TO MEDDLE WITH OR SMOOTH THEM EVERY NOW AND THEN NOT OFTEN BUT FOR A FOIL I CARRIED A BOOK IN MY POCKET OR PERHAPS TORE OUT FROM SOME BROKEN OR CHEAP EDITION A BUNCH OF LOOSE LEAVES
1647-140649-0067 IN THAT WAY UTTERLY OUT OF REACH OF LITERARY CONVENTIONS I RE READ MANY AUTHORS I CANNOT DIVEST MY APPETITE OF LITERATURE YET I FIND MYSELF EVENTUALLY TRYING IT ALL BY NATURE
1647-140649-0068 FIRST PREMISES MANY CALL IT BUT REALLY THE CROWNING RESULTS OF ALL LAWS TALLIES AND PROOFS
1647-140649-0069 THE MOUNTAIN AND THE FOREST PUTTING THEIR SPIRIT IN A JUDGMENT ON OUR BOOKS I HAVE FANCIED SOME DISEMBODIED HUMAN SOUL GIVING ITS VERDICT NATURE AND DEMOCRACY MORALITY
1647-140649-0070 DEMOCRACY MOST OF ALL AFFILIATES WITH THE OPEN AIR IS SUNNY AND HARDY AND SANE ONLY WITH NATURE JUST AS MUCH AS ART IS
1647-140649-0071 TO CHECK THEM RESTRAIN THEM FROM EXCESS MORBIDITY I HAVE WANTED BEFORE DEPARTURE TO BEAR SPECIAL TESTIMONY TO A VERY OLD LESSON AND REQUISITE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY
1647-140649-0072 THROUGH THE DENSE STREETS AND HOUSES OF CITIES AND ALL THEIR MANIFOLD SOPHISTICATED LIFE MUST EITHER BE FIBRED VITALIZED BY REGULAR CONTACT WITH OUT DOOR LIGHT AND AIR AND GROWTHS
1647-140649-0073 FIELDS TREES BIRDS SUN WARMTH AND FREE SKIES OR IT WILL CERTAINLY DWINDLE AND PALE WE CANNOT HAVE GRAND RACES OF MECHANICS WORK PEOPLE AND COMMONALTY
1647-140649-0074 THE ONLY SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF AMERICA ON ANY LESS TERMS I CONCEIVE OF NO FLOURISHING AND HEROIC ELEMENTS OF DEMOCRACY IN THE UNITED STATES OR OF DEMOCRACY MAINTAINING ITSELF AT ALL
1647-140649-0075 WITHOUT THE NATURE ELEMENT FORMING A MAIN PART TO BE ITS HEALTH ELEMENT AND BEAUTY ELEMENT TO REALLY UNDERLIE THE WHOLE POLITICS SANITY RELIGION AND ART OF THE NEW WORLD FINALLY THE MORALITY
1647-140649-0076 VIRTUE SAID MARCUS AURELIUS WHAT IS IT ONLY A LIVING AND ENTHUSIASTIC SYMPATHY WITH NATURE PERHAPS INDEED THE EFFORTS OF THE TRUE POETS FOUNDERS RELIGIONS LITERATURES
1647-140649-0077 ALL AGES HAVE BEEN AND EVER WILL BE OUR TIME AND TIMES TO COME ESSENTIALLY THE SAME TO BRING PEOPLE BACK FROM THEIR PERSISTENT STRAYINGS AND SICKLY ABSTRACTIONS TO THE COSTLESS AVERAGE
