2676-143903-0000 SHE APPARENTLY HAD FULFILLED THE NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE NEXT MORNING IN THE COLD FAINT DAWN SHE KNEW THAT A SPIRIT WAS STANDING BY HER BED SHE HAD LAIN DOWN WITHOUT UNDRESSING IT BEING HER BELIEF THAT RALPH WOULD NOT OUTLAST THE NIGHT
2676-143903-0001 SHE HAD NO INCLINATION TO SLEEP SHE WAS WAITING AND SUCH WAITING WAS WAKEFUL BUT SHE CLOSED HER EYES SHE BELIEVED THAT AS THE NIGHT WORE ON SHE SHOULD HEAR A KNOCK AT HER DOOR SHE HEARD NO KNOCK
2676-143903-0002 BUT AT THE TIME THE DARKNESS BEGAN VAGUELY TO GROW GREY SHE STARTED UP FROM HER PILLOW AS ABRUPTLY AS IF SHE HAD RECEIVED A SUMMONS IT SEEMED TO HER FOR AN INSTANT THAT HE WAS STANDING THERE
2676-143903-0003 A VAGUE HOVERING FIGURE IN THE VAGUENESS OF THE ROOM SHE STARED A MOMENT SHE SAW HIS WHITE FACE HIS KIND EYES THEN SHE SAW THERE WAS NOTHING SHE WAS NOT AFRAID SHE WAS ONLY SURE
2676-143903-0004 SHE QUITTED THE PLACE AND IN HER CERTAINTY PASSED THROUGH DARK CORRIDORS AND DOWN A FLIGHT OF OAKEN STEPS THAT SHONE IN THE VAGUE LIGHT OF A HALL WINDOW OUTSIDE RALPH'S DOOR SHE STOPPED A MOMENT LISTENING
2676-143903-0005 SHE OPENED THE DOOR WITH A HAND AS GENTLE AS IF SHE WERE LIFTING A VEIL FROM THE FACE OF THE DEAD AND SAW MISSUS TOUCHETT SITTING MOTIONLESS AND UPRIGHT BESIDE THE COUCH OF HER SON WITH ONE OF HIS HANDS IN HER OWN
2676-143903-0006 THE DOCTOR WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH POOR RALPH'S FURTHER WRIST RESTING IN HIS PROFESSIONAL FINGERS THE TWO NURSES WERE AT THE FOOT BETWEEN THEM MISSUS TOUCHETT TOOK NO NOTICE OF ISABEL
2676-143903-0007 BUT THE DOCTOR LOOKED AT HER VERY HARD THEN HE GENTLY PLACED RALPH'S HAND IN A PROPER POSITION CLOSE BESIDE HIM THE NURSE LOOKED AT HER VERY HARD TOO AND NO ONE SAID A WORD BUT ISABEL ONLY LOOKED AT WHAT SHE HAD COME TO SEE
2676-143903-0008 IT WAS FAIRER THAN RALPH HAD EVER BEEN IN LIFE AND THERE WAS A STRANGE RESEMBLANCE TO THE FACE OF HIS FATHER WHICH SIX YEARS BEFORE SHE HAD SEEN LYING ON THE SAME PILLOW SHE WENT TO HER AUNT AND PUT HER ARM AROUND HER
2676-143903-0009 AND MISSUS TOUCHETT WHO AS A GENERAL THING NEITHER INVITED NOR ENJOYED CARESSES SUBMITTED FOR A MOMENT TO THIS ONE RISING AS MIGHT BE TO TAKE IT BUT SHE WAS STIFF AND DRY EYED
2676-143903-0010 HER ACUTE WHITE FACE WAS TERRIBLE DEAR AUNT LYDIA ISABEL MURMURED GO AND THANK GOD YOU'VE NO CHILD SAID MISSUS TOUCHETT DISENGAGING HERSELF
2676-143903-0011 THREE DAYS AFTER THIS A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FOUND TIME AT THE HEIGHT OF THE LONDON SEASON TO TAKE A MORNING TRAIN DOWN TO A QUIET STATION IN BERKSHIRE
2676-143903-0012 AND SPEND HALF AN HOUR IN A SMALL GREY CHURCH WHICH STOOD WITHIN AN EASY WALK IT WAS IN THE GREEN BURIAL PLACE OF THIS EDIFICE THAT MISSUS TOUCHETT CONSIGNED HER SON TO EARTH SHE STOOD HERSELF AT THE EDGE OF THE GRAVE
2676-143903-0013 AND ISABEL STOOD BESIDE HER THE SEXTON HIMSELF HAD NOT A MORE PRACTICAL INTEREST IN THE SCENE THAN MISSUS TOUCHETT IT WAS A SOLEMN OCCASION BUT NEITHER A HARSH NOR A HEAVY ONE THERE WAS A CERTAIN GENIALITY IN THE APPEARANCE OF THINGS
2676-143903-0014 THE WEATHER HAD CHANGED TO FAIR THE DAY ONE OF THE LAST OF THE TREACHEROUS MAY TIME WAS WARM AND WINDLESS AND THE AIR HAD THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE HAWTHORN AND THE BLACKBIRD IF IT WAS SAD TO THINK OF POOR TOUCHETT
2676-143903-0015 IT WAS NOT TOO SAD SINCE DEATH FOR HIM HAD HAD NO VIOLENCE HE HAD BEEN DYING SO LONG HE WAS SO READY EVERYTHING HAD BEEN SO EXPECTED AND PREPARED THERE WERE TEARS IN ISABEL'S EYES
2676-143903-0016 BUT THEY WERE NOT TEARS THAT BLINDED SHE LOOKED THROUGH THEM AT THE BEAUTY OF THE DAY THE SPLENDOUR OF NATURE THE SWEETNESS OF THE OLD ENGLISH CHURCHYARD THE BOWED HEADS OF GOOD FRIENDS LORD WARBURTON WAS THERE AND A GROUP OF GENTLEMEN ALL UNKNOWN TO HER
2676-143903-0017 WERE CONNECTED WITH THE BANK AND THERE WERE OTHERS WHOM SHE KNEW MISS STACKPOLE WAS AMONG THE FIRST WITH HONEST MISTER BANTLING BESIDE HER AND CASPAR GOODWOOD LIFTING HIS HEAD HIGHER THAN THE REST BOWING IT RATHER LESS
2676-143903-0018 DURING MUCH OF THE TIME ISABEL WAS CONSCIOUS OF MISTER GOODWOOD'S GAZE HE LOOKED AT HER SOMEWHAT HARDER THAN HE USUALLY LOOKED IN PUBLIC WHILE THE OTHERS HAD FIXED THEIR EYES UPON THE CHURCHYARD TURF BUT SHE NEVER LET HIM SEE THAT SHE SAW HIM
2676-143903-0019 SHE THOUGHT OF HIM ONLY TO WONDER THAT HE WAS STILL IN ENGLAND SHE FOUND SHE HAD TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT AFTER ACCOMPANYING RALPH TO GARDENCOURT HE HAD GONE AWAY SHE REMEMBERED HOW LITTLE IT WAS A COUNTRY THAT PLEASED HIM HE WAS THERE HOWEVER
2676-143903-0020 VERY DISTINCTLY THERE AND SOMETHING IN HIS ATTITUDE SEEMED TO SAY THAT HE WAS THERE WITH A COMPLEX INTENTION SHE WOULDN'T MEET HIS EYES THOUGH THERE WAS DOUBTLESS SYMPATHY IN THEM HE MADE HER RATHER UNEASY
2676-143903-0021 WITH THE DISPERSAL OF THE LITTLE GROUP HE DISAPPEARED AND THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAME TO SPEAK TO HER THOUGH SEVERAL SPOKE TO MISSUS TOUCHETT WAS HENRIETTA STACKPOLE HENRIETTA HAD BEEN CRYING RALPH HAD SAID TO ISABEL
2676-143903-0022 THAT HE HOPED SHE WOULD REMAIN AT GARDENCOURT AND SHE MADE NO IMMEDIATE MOTION TO LEAVE THE PLACE SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT IT WAS BUT COMMON CHARITY TO STAY A LITTLE WITH HER AUNT IT WAS FORTUNATE SHE HAD SO GOOD A FORMULA
2676-143903-0023 OTHERWISE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GREATLY IN WANT OF ONE HER ERRAND WAS OVER SHE HAD DONE WHAT SHE HAD LEFT HER HUSBAND TO DO SHE HAD A HUSBAND IN A FOREIGN CITY COUNTING THE HOURS OF HER ABSENCE IN SUCH A CASE
2676-143903-0024 ONE NEEDED AN EXCELLENT MOTIVE HE WAS NOT ONE OF THE BEST HUSBANDS BUT THAT DIDN'T ALTER THE CASE CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS WERE INVOLVED IN THE VERY FACT OF MARRIAGE AND WERE QUITE INDEPENDENT OF THE QUANTITY OF ENJOYMENT EXTRACTED FROM IT
2676-143903-0025 ISABEL THOUGHT OF HER HUSBAND AS LITTLE AS MIGHT BE BUT NOW THAT SHE WAS AT A DISTANCE BEYOND ITS SPELL SHE THOUGHT WITH A KIND OF SPIRITUAL SHUDDER OF ROME THERE WAS A PENETRATING CHILL IN THE IMAGE AND SHE DREW BACK
2676-143903-0026 INTO THE DEEPEST SHADE OF GARDENCOURT SHE LIVED FROM DAY TO DAY POSTPONING CLOSING HER EYES TRYING NOT TO THINK SHE KNEW SHE MUST DECIDE BUT SHE DECIDED NOTHING
2676-143903-0027 HER COMING ITSELF HAD NOT BEEN A DECISION ON THAT OCCASION SHE HAD SIMPLY STARTED OSMOND GAVE NO SOUND AND NOW EVIDENTLY WOULD GIVE NONE HE WOULD LEAVE IT ALL TO HER FROM PANSY SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THAT WAS VERY SIMPLE
2676-143903-0028 HER FATHER HAD TOLD HER NOT TO WRITE MISSUS TOUCHETT ACCEPTED ISABEL'S COMPANY BUT OFFERED HER NO ASSISTANCE SHE APPEARED TO BE ABSORBED IN CONSIDERING WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM BUT WITH PERFECT LUCIDITY
2676-143903-0029 THE NEW CONVENIENCES OF HER OWN SITUATION MISSUS TOUCHETT WAS NOT AN OPTIMIST BUT EVEN FROM PAINFUL OCCURRENCES SHE MANAGED TO EXTRACT A CERTAIN UTILITY THIS CONSISTED IN THE REFLEXION THAT AFTER ALL
2676-143903-0030 DEATH WAS DISAGREEABLE BUT IN THIS CASE IT WAS HER SON'S DEATH NOT HER OWN SHE HAD NEVER FLATTERED HERSELF THAT HER OWN WOULD BE DISAGREEABLE TO ANY ONE BUT MISSUS TOUCHETT SHE WAS BETTER OFF THAN POOR RALPH
2676-143903-0031 WHO HAD LEFT ALL THE COMMODITIES OF LIFE BEHIND HIM AND INDEED ALL THE SECURITY
2676-143903-0032 THAT IT EXPOSED ONE TO BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF FOR HERSELF SHE WAS ON THE SPOT THERE WAS NOTHING SO GOOD AS THAT SHE MADE KNOWN TO ISABEL VERY PUNCTUALLY IT WAS THE EVENING HER SON WAS BURIED
2676-143903-0033 SEVERAL OF RALPH'S TESTAMENTARY ARRANGEMENTS HE HAD TOLD HER EVERYTHING HAD CONSULTED HER ABOUT EVERYTHING HE LEFT HER NO MONEY OF COURSE SHE HAD NO NEED OF MONEY HE LEFT HER THE FURNITURE OF GARDENCOURT
2676-143903-0034 EXCLUSIVE OF THE PICTURES AND BOOKS AND THE USE OF THE PLACE FOR A YEAR AFTER WHICH IT WAS TO BE SOLD THE MONEY PRODUCED BY THE SALE WAS TO CONSTITUTE AN ENDOWMENT FOR A HOSPITAL FOR POOR PERSONS SUFFERING FROM THE MALADY OF WHICH HE DIED
2676-143903-0035 AND OF THIS PORTION OF THE WILL LORD WARBURTON WAS APPOINTED EXECUTOR THE REST OF HIS PROPERTY WHICH WAS TO BE WITHDRAWN FROM THE BANK WAS DISPOSED OF IN VARIOUS BEQUESTS SEVERAL OF THEM TO THOSE COUSINS IN VERMONT
2676-143903-0036 TO WHOM HIS FATHER HAD ALREADY BEEN SO BOUNTIFUL THEN THERE WERE A NUMBER OF SMALL LEGACIES SOME OF THEM ARE EXTREMELY PECULIAR SAID MISSUS TOUCHETT HE HAS LEFT CONSIDERABLE SUMS TO PERSONS I NEVER HEARD OF
2676-143903-0037 APPARENTLY HE THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T LIKE HIM FOR HE HASN'T LEFT YOU A PENNY IT WAS HIS OPINION THAT YOU HAD BEEN HANDSOMELY TREATED BY HIS FATHER WHICH I'M BOUND TO SAY I THINK YOU WERE THOUGH I DON'T MEAN THAT I EVER HEARD HIM COMPLAIN OF IT
2676-143903-0038 THE PICTURES ARE TO BE DISPERSED HE HAS DISTRIBUTED THEM ABOUT ONE BY ONE AS LITTLE KEEPSAKES
2676-143903-0039 IT SOUNDS LIKE A PRACTICAL JOKE
2676-143903-0040 DOES HE MEAN HER FOLLOWING HIM UP FROM ROME WAS THAT A SERVICE TO LITERATURE IT CONTAINS A GREAT MANY RARE AND VALUABLE BOOKS AND AS SHE CAN'T CARRY IT ABOUT THE WORLD IN HER TRUNK HE RECOMMENDS HER TO SELL IT AT AUCTION
2676-143903-0041 SHE WILL SELL IT OF COURSE AT CHRISTIE'S AND WITH THE PROCEEDS SHE'LL SET UP A NEWSPAPER WILL THAT BE A SERVICE TO LITERATURE THIS QUESTION ISABEL FORBORE TO ANSWER
2676-143903-0042 AS IT EXCEEDED THE LITTLE INTERROGATORY TO WHICH SHE HAD DEEMED IT NECESSARY TO SUBMIT ON HER ARRIVAL BESIDES SHE HAD NEVER BEEN LESS INTERESTED IN LITERATURE THAN TO DAY
2676-143903-0043 AS SHE FOUND WHEN SHE OCCASIONALLY TOOK DOWN FROM THE SHELF ONE OF THE RARE AND VALUABLE VOLUMES OF WHICH MISSUS TOUCHETT HAD SPOKEN SHE WAS QUITE UNABLE TO READ HER ATTENTION HAD NEVER BEEN SO LITTLE AT HER COMMAND
2676-143903-0044 ONE AFTERNOON IN THE LIBRARY ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THE CEREMONY IN THE CHURCHYARD SHE WAS TRYING TO FIX IT FOR AN HOUR BUT HER EYES OFTEN WANDERED FROM THE BOOK IN HER HAND TO THE OPEN WINDOW WHICH LOOKED DOWN THE LONG AVENUE IT WAS IN THIS WAY
2676-143903-0045 IN A CORNER OF IT HE HAD ALWAYS HAD A HIGH STANDARD OF COURTESY AND IT WAS THEREFORE NOT REMARKABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO COME DOWN FROM LONDON TO CALL ON MISSUS TOUCHETT
2676-143903-0046 THE THEORY I HAVE JUST MENTIONED WAS PLAUSIBLE ENOUGH BUT IT BROUGHT HER LITTLE REST AND IF YOU HAD SEEN HER PACING ABOUT YOU WOULD HAVE SAID SHE HAD A BAD CONSCIENCE SHE WAS NOT PACIFIED WHEN AT THE END OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR FINDING HERSELF IN VIEW OF THE HOUSE
2676-143903-0047 SHE SAW MISSUS TOUCHETT EMERGE FROM THE PORTICO ACCOMPANIED BY HER VISITOR HER AUNT HAD EVIDENTLY PROPOSED TO LORD WARBURTON THAT THEY SHOULD COME IN SEARCH OF HER SHE WAS IN NO HUMOUR FOR VISITORS AND IF SHE HAD HAD A CHANCE
2676-143903-0048 WOULD HAVE DRAWN BACK BEHIND ONE OF THE GREAT TREES BUT SHE SAW SHE HAD BEEN SEEN AND THAT NOTHING WAS LEFT HER BUT TO ADVANCE AS THE LAWN AT GARDENCOURT WAS A VAST EXPANSE THIS TOOK SOME TIME DURING WHICH SHE OBSERVED THAT
2676-143903-0049 AS HE WALKED BESIDE HIS HOSTESS LORD WARBURTON KEPT HIS HANDS RATHER STIFFLY BEHIND HIM AND HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND BOTH PERSONS APPARENTLY WERE SILENT
2676-143903-0050 AS SHE DIRECTED IT TOWARD ISABEL HAD EVEN AT A DISTANCE AN EXPRESSION IT SEEMED TO SAY WITH CUTTING SHARPNESS HERE'S THE EMINENTLY AMENABLE NOBLEMAN YOU MIGHT HAVE MARRIED WHEN LORD WARBURTON LIFTED HIS OWN EYES HOWEVER
2676-143903-0051 THAT WAS NOT WHAT THEY SAID THEY ONLY SAID THIS IS RATHER AWKWARD YOU KNOW AND I DEPEND UPON YOU TO HELP ME HE WAS VERY GRAVE VERY PROPER AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE ISABEL HAD KNOWN HIM
2676-143903-0052 GREETED HER WITHOUT A SMILE EVEN IN HIS DAYS OF DISTRESS HE HAD ALWAYS BEGUN WITH A SMILE HE LOOKED EXTREMELY SELFCONSCIOUS LORD WARBURTON HAS BEEN SO GOOD AS TO COME OUT TO SEE ME SAID MISSUS TOUCHETT
2676-143903-0053 HE TELLS ME HE DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE STILL HERE I KNOW HE'S AN OLD FRIEND OF YOURS AND AS I WAS TOLD YOU WERE NOT IN THE HOUSE I BROUGHT HIM OUT TO SEE FOR HIMSELF
2676-143903-0054 THAT WOULD GET ME BACK IN TIME FOR DINNER
2676-143903-0055 I'M SO GLAD TO FIND YOU'VE NOT GONE I'M NOT HERE FOR LONG YOU KNOW ISABEL SAID WITH A CERTAIN EAGERNESS I SUPPOSE NOT BUT I HOPE IT'S FOR SOME WEEKS YOU CAME TO ENGLAND SOONER THAN A THAN YOU THOUGHT
2676-143903-0056 YES I CAME VERY SUDDENLY MISSUS TOUCHETT TURNED AWAY AS IF SHE WERE LOOKING AT THE CONDITION OF THE GROUNDS WHICH INDEED WAS NOT WHAT IT SHOULD BE WHILE LORD WARBURTON HESITATED A LITTLE
2676-143903-0057 ISABEL FANCIED HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF ASKING ABOUT HER HUSBAND RATHER CONFUSEDLY AND THEN HAD CHECKED HIMSELF HE CONTINUED IMMITIGABLY GRAVE EITHER BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT BECOMING IN A PLACE OVER WHICH DEATH HAD JUST PASSED
2676-143903-0058 OR FOR MORE PERSONAL REASONS IF HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF PERSONAL REASONS IT WAS VERY FORTUNATE THAT HE HAD THE COVER OF THE FORMER MOTIVE HE COULD MAKE THE MOST OF THAT ISABEL THOUGHT OF ALL THIS IT WAS NOT THAT HIS FACE WAS SAD
2676-143903-0059 FOR THAT WAS ANOTHER MATTER BUT IT WAS STRANGELY INEXPRESSIVE MY SISTERS WOULD HAVE BEEN SO GLAD TO COME IF THEY HAD KNOWN YOU WERE STILL HERE IF THEY HAD THOUGHT YOU WOULD SEE THEM LORD WARBURTON WENT ON
2676-143903-0060 DO KINDLY LET THEM SEE YOU BEFORE YOU LEAVE ENGLAND IT WOULD GIVE ME GREAT PLEASURE I HAVE SUCH A FRIENDLY RECOLLECTION OF THEM I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU WOULD COME TO LOCKLEIGH FOR A DAY OR TWO YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS THAT OLD PROMISE
2676-143903-0061 AND HIS LORDSHIP COLOURED A LITTLE AS HE MADE THIS SUGGESTION WHICH GAVE HIS FACE A SOMEWHAT MORE FAMILIAR AIR PERHAPS I'M NOT RIGHT IN SAYING THAT JUST NOW OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT THINKING OF VISITING BUT I MEANT WHAT WOULD HARDLY BE A VISIT
2676-143903-0062 I WOULD SEE THAT THERE SHOULD BE LITERALLY NO ONE ELSE ISABEL WONDERED IF NOT EVEN THE YOUNG LADY HE WAS TO MARRY WOULD BE THERE WITH HER MAMMA BUT SHE DID NOT EXPRESS THIS IDEA THANK YOU EXTREMELY
2676-143903-0063 SHE CONTENTED HERSELF WITH SAYING I'M AFRAID I HARDLY KNOW ABOUT WHITSUNTIDE BUT I HAVE YOUR PROMISE HAVEN'T I FOR SOME OTHER TIME THERE WAS AN INTERROGATION IN THIS BUT ISABEL LET IT PASS
2676-143903-0064 SHE LOOKED AT HER INTERLOCUTOR A MOMENT AND THE RESULT OF HER OBSERVATION WAS THAT AS HAD HAPPENED BEFORE SHE FELT SORRY FOR HIM TAKE CARE YOU DON'T MISS YOUR TRAIN SHE SAID AND THEN SHE ADDED I WISH YOU EVERY HAPPINESS
2676-143903-0065 HE BLUSHED AGAIN MORE THAN BEFORE AND HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
2676-143903-0066 I HAVEN'T MUCH TIME BUT I'VE A FLY AT THE DOOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT WAS NOT APPARENT WHETHER THE THANKS APPLIED TO HER HAVING REMINDED HIM OF HIS TRAIN OR TO THE MORE SENTIMENTAL REMARK GOOD BYE MISSUS OSMOND GOOD BYE
2676-143903-0067 HE SHOOK HANDS WITH HER WITHOUT MEETING HER EYES AND THEN HE TURNED TO MISSUS TOUCHETT WHO HAD WANDERED BACK TO THEM WITH HER HIS PARTING WAS EQUALLY BRIEF AND IN A MOMENT THE TWO LADIES SAW HIM MOVE WITH LONG STEPS ACROSS THE LAWN
2676-143903-0068 ARE YOU VERY SURE HE'S TO BE MARRIED
2676-143903-0069 AH SAID ISABEL I GIVE IT UP WHILE HER AUNT RETURNED TO THE HOUSE AND TO THOSE AVOCATIONS WHICH THE VISITOR HAD INTERRUPTED SHE GAVE IT UP BUT SHE STILL THOUGHT OF IT
2676-143903-0070 SHE STOOD AND LOOKED AT IT AS IF IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO HER SHE WOULDN'T SIT DOWN ON IT NOW SHE FELT RATHER AFRAID OF IT SHE ONLY STOOD BEFORE IT
2676-143903-0071 IF YOU HAD SEEN HER THERE YOU WOULD HAVE ADMIRED THE JUSTICE OF THE FORMER EPITHET YOU WOULD AT LEAST HAVE ALLOWED THAT AT THIS MOMENT
2676-143903-0072 DINED EARLY AND HAD TEA AT AN INDEFINITE HOUR HOW LONG SHE HAD SAT IN THIS POSITION SHE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD YOU BUT THE TWILIGHT HAD GROWN THICK WHEN SHE BECAME AWARE THAT SHE WAS NOT ALONE SHE QUICKLY STRAIGHTENED HERSELF GLANCING ABOUT
2676-143903-0073 BUT FELT LIKE SHE KNEW NOT WHAT
2676-143903-0074 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS FACE THAT SHE WISHED NOT TO SEE
2676-143903-0075 NO MATTER I CAME FROM LONDON A WHILE AGO BY THE TRAIN BUT I COULDN'T COME HERE DIRECTLY THERE WAS A MAN AT THE STATION WHO GOT AHEAD OF ME HE TOOK A FLY THAT WAS THERE AND I HEARD HIM GIVE THE ORDER TO DRIVE HERE
2676-143903-0076 I DON'T KNOW WHO HE WAS BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO COME WITH HIM I WANTED TO SEE YOU ALONE SO I'VE BEEN WAITING AND WALKING ABOUT
2676-143903-0077 I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU GOODWOOD SPOKE VERY FAST HE WAS AS EXCITED AS WHEN THEY HAD PARTED IN ROME ISABEL HAD HOPED THAT CONDITION WOULD SUBSIDE AND SHE SHRANK INTO HERSELF AS SHE PERCEIVED THAT ON THE CONTRARY
2676-143903-0078 HE HAD ONLY LET OUT SAIL SHE HAD A NEW SENSATION HE HAD NEVER PRODUCED IT BEFORE IT WAS A FEELING OF DANGER THERE WAS INDEED SOMETHING REALLY FORMIDABLE IN HIS RESOLUTION
2676-143903-0079 SHE GAZED STRAIGHT BEFORE HER HE WITH A HAND ON EACH KNEE LEANED FORWARD LOOKING DEEPLY INTO HER FACE THE TWILIGHT SEEMED TO DARKEN ROUND THEM I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU HE REPEATED I'VE SOMETHING PARTICULAR TO SAY I DON'T WANT TO TROUBLE YOU
2676-143903-0080 AS I DID THE OTHER DAY IN ROME THAT WAS OF NO USE IT ONLY DISTRESSED YOU
2676-143903-0081 OR BECAUSE SUCH A VOICE IN THE DARKNESS SEEMED OF NECESSITY A BOON BUT SHE LISTENED TO HIM AS SHE HAD NEVER LISTENED BEFORE HIS WORDS DROPPED DEEP INTO HER SOUL THEY PRODUCED A SORT OF STILLNESS IN ALL HER BEING
2676-143903-0082 AND IT WAS WITH AN EFFORT IN A MOMENT THAT SHE ANSWERED HIM HOW CAN YOU HELP ME SHE ASKED IN A LOW TONE AS IF SHE WERE TAKING WHAT HE HAD SAID SERIOUSLY ENOUGH TO MAKE THE ENQUIRY IN CONFIDENCE BY INDUCING YOU TO TRUST ME
2676-143903-0083 THEN I WAS QUITE IN THE DARK BUT TO DAY I KNOW ON GOOD AUTHORITY EVERYTHING'S CLEAR TO ME TO DAY IT WAS A GOOD THING WHEN YOU MADE ME COME AWAY WITH YOUR COUSIN HE WAS A GOOD MAN A FINE MAN ONE OF THE BEST HE TOLD ME HOW THE CASE STANDS FOR YOU
2676-143903-0084 HE EXPLAINED EVERYTHING HE GUESSED MY SENTIMENTS HE WAS A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY AND HE LEFT YOU SO LONG AS YOU SHOULD BE IN ENGLAND TO MY CARE SAID GOODWOOD AS IF HE WERE MAKING A GREAT POINT
2676-143903-0085 DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID TO ME THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM AS HE LAY THERE WHERE HE DIED HE SAID DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN FOR HER DO EVERYTHING SHE'LL LET YOU
2676-143903-0086 ISABEL SUDDENLY GOT UP YOU HAD NO BUSINESS TO TALK ABOUT ME WHY NOT WHY NOT WHEN WE TALKED IN THAT WAY HE DEMANDED FOLLOWING HER FAST AND HE WAS DYING
2676-143903-0087 WHEN A MAN'S DYING IT'S DIFFERENT SHE CHECKED THE MOVEMENT SHE HAD MADE TO LEAVE HIM SHE WAS LISTENING MORE THAN EVER IT WAS TRUE THAT HE WAS NOT THE SAME AS THAT LAST TIME THAT HAD BEEN AIMLESS FRUITLESS PASSION
2676-143903-0088 BUT AT PRESENT HE HAD AN IDEA WHICH SHE SCENTED IN ALL HER BEING BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER HE EXCLAIMED PRESSING HER STILL HARDER THOUGH NOW WITHOUT TOUCHING A HEM OF HER GARMENT
2676-143903-0089 IF TOUCHETT HAD NEVER OPENED HIS MOUTH I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ALL THE SAME I HAD ONLY TO LOOK AT YOU AT YOUR COUSIN'S FUNERAL TO SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU YOU CAN'T DECEIVE ME ANY MORE FOR GOD'S SAKE BE HONEST WITH A MAN WHO'S SO HONEST WITH YOU YOU'RE THE MOST UNHAPPY OF WOMEN
2676-143903-0090 I'VE NEVER BEEN SO SANE I SEE THE WHOLE THING DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO DEFEND HIM BUT I WON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD AGAINST HIM I'LL SPEAK ONLY OF YOU GOODWOOD ADDED QUICKLY
2676-143903-0091 HOW CAN YOU PRETEND YOU'RE NOT HEART BROKEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN IT'S TOO LATE TO PLAY A PART DIDN'T YOU LEAVE ALL THAT BEHIND YOU IN ROME TOUCHETT KNEW ALL ABOUT IT AND I KNEW IT TOO
2676-143903-0092 SAY IT WILL AND HE FLARED ALMOST INTO ANGER GIVE ME ONE WORD OF TRUTH WHEN I KNOW SUCH A HORROR AS THAT HOW CAN I KEEP MYSELF FROM WISHING TO SAVE YOU
2676-143903-0093 WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF ME IF I SHOULD STAND STILL AND SEE YOU GO BACK TO YOUR REWARD IT'S AWFUL WHAT SHE'LL HAVE TO PAY FOR IT THAT'S WHAT TOUCHETT SAID TO ME I MAY TELL YOU THAT MAYN'T I HE WAS SUCH A NEAR RELATION CRIED GOODWOOD
2676-143903-0094 MAKING HIS QUEER GRIM POINT AGAIN I'D SOONER HAVE BEEN SHOT THAN LET ANOTHER MAN SAY THOSE THINGS TO ME BUT HE WAS DIFFERENT HE SEEMED TO ME TO HAVE THE RIGHT IT WAS AFTER HE GOT HOME WHEN HE SAW HE WAS DYING AND WHEN I SAW IT TOO
2676-143903-0095 I UNDERSTAND ALL ABOUT IT YOU'RE AFRAID TO GO BACK YOU'RE PERFECTLY ALONE YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN YOU CAN'T TURN ANYWHERE YOU KNOW THAT PERFECTLY NOW IT IS THEREFORE THAT I WANT YOU TO THINK OF ME
2676-143903-0096 TO THINK OF YOU ISABEL SAID STANDING BEFORE HIM IN THE DUSK THE IDEA OF WHICH SHE HAD CAUGHT A GLIMPSE A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE NOW LOOMED LARGE SHE THREW BACK HER HEAD A LITTLE SHE STARED AT IT AS IF IT HAD BEEN A COMET IN THE SKY
2676-143903-0097 YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN TURN STRAIGHT TO ME I WANT TO PERSUADE YOU TO TRUST ME GOODWOOD REPEATED AND THEN HE PAUSED WITH HIS SHINING EYES WHY SHOULD YOU GO BACK WHY SHOULD YOU GO THROUGH THAT GHASTLY FORM
2676-143903-0098 TO GET AWAY FROM YOU SHE ANSWERED BUT THIS EXPRESSED ONLY A LITTLE OF WHAT SHE FELT THE REST WAS THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN LOVED BEFORE SHE HAD BELIEVED IT BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT THIS WAS THE HOT WIND OF THE DESERT
2676-143903-0099 AT THE APPROACH OF WHICH THE OTHERS DROPPED DEAD LIKE MERE SWEET AIRS OF THE GARDEN IT WRAPPED HER ABOUT IT LIFTED HER OFF HER FEET WHILE THE VERY TASTE OF IT AS OF SOMETHING POTENT ACRID AND STRANGE FORCED OPEN HER SET TEETH
2676-143903-0100 AT FIRST IN REJOINDER TO WHAT SHE HAD SAID IT SEEMED TO HER THAT HE WOULD BREAK OUT INTO GREATER VIOLENCE BUT AFTER AN INSTANT HE WAS PERFECTLY QUIET HE WISHED TO PROVE HE WAS SANE THAT HE HAD REASONED IT ALL OUT
2676-143903-0101 I WANT TO PREVENT THAT AND I THINK I MAY IF YOU'LL ONLY FOR ONCE LISTEN TO ME IT'S TOO MONSTROUS OF YOU TO THINK OF SINKING BACK INTO THAT MISERY OF GOING TO OPEN YOUR MOUTH TO THAT POISONED AIR IT'S YOU THAT ARE OUT OF YOUR MIND
2676-143903-0102 TRUST ME AS IF I HAD THE CARE OF YOU WHY SHOULDN'T WE BE HAPPY WHEN IT'S HERE BEFORE US WHEN IT'S SO EASY I'M YOURS FOR EVER FOR EVER AND EVER HERE I STAND I'M AS FIRM AS A ROCK WHAT HAVE YOU TO CARE ABOUT
2676-143903-0103 AS IT IS YOU'VE NOTHING TO CONSIDER YOU MUST SAVE WHAT YOU CAN OF YOUR LIFE YOU MUSTN'T LOSE IT ALL SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU'VE LOST A PART IT WOULD BE AN INSULT TO YOU TO ASSUME THAT YOU CARE FOR THE LOOK OF THE THING FOR WHAT PEOPLE WILL SAY
2676-143903-0104 FOR THE BOTTOMLESS IDIOCY OF THE WORLD WE'VE NOTHING TO DO WITH ALL THAT WE'RE QUITE OUT OF IT WE LOOK AT THINGS AS THEY ARE YOU TOOK THE GREAT STEP IN COMING AWAY THE NEXT IS NOTHING IT'S THE NATURAL ONE I SWEAR AS I STAND HERE
2676-143903-0105 THAT A WOMAN DELIBERATELY MADE TO SUFFER IS JUSTIFIED IN ANYTHING IN LIFE IN GOING DOWN INTO THE STREETS IF THAT WILL HELP HER I KNOW HOW YOU SUFFER AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE WE CAN DO ABSOLUTELY AS WE PLEASE TO WHOM UNDER THE SUN DO WE OWE ANYTHING
2676-143903-0106 WHAT IS IT THAT HOLDS US WHAT IS IT THAT HAS THE SMALLEST RIGHT TO INTERFERE IN SUCH A QUESTION AS THIS SUCH A QUESTION IS BETWEEN OURSELVES AND TO SAY THAT IS TO SETTLE IT
2676-143903-0107 WERE WE BORN TO BE AFRAID I NEVER KNEW YOU AFRAID IF YOU'LL ONLY TRUST ME HOW LITTLE YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED
2676-143903-0108 SHE SAID IT AT RANDOM TO HEAR HERSELF SAY SOMETHING BUT IT WAS NOT WHAT SHE MEANT THE WORLD IN TRUTH HAD NEVER SEEMED SO LARGE IT SEEMED TO OPEN OUT ALL ROUND HER TO TAKE THE FORM OF A MIGHTY SEA WHERE SHE FLOATED IN FATHOMLESS WATERS
2676-143903-0109 SHE HAD WANTED HELP AND HERE WAS HELP IT HAD COME IN A RUSHING TORRENT I KNOW NOT WHETHER SHE BELIEVED EVERYTHING HE SAID BUT SHE BELIEVED JUST THEN THAT TO LET HIM TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS WOULD BE THE NEXT BEST THING TO HER DYING THIS BELIEF FOR A MOMENT
2676-143903-0110 SHE SEEMED TO BEAT WITH HER FEET IN ORDER TO CATCH HERSELF TO FEEL SOMETHING TO REST ON AH BE MINE AS I'M YOURS SHE HEARD HER COMPANION CRY HE HAD SUDDENLY GIVEN UP ARGUMENT AND HIS VOICE SEEMED TO COME
2676-143903-0111 HARSH AND TERRIBLE THROUGH A CONFUSION OF VAGUER SOUNDS THIS HOWEVER OF COURSE WAS BUT A SUBJECTIVE FACT AS THE METAPHYSICIANS SAY THE CONFUSION THE NOISE OF WATERS ALL THE REST OF IT WERE IN HER OWN SWIMMING HEAD
2676-143903-0112 IN AN INSTANT SHE BECAME AWARE OF THIS DO ME THE GREATEST KINDNESS OF ALL SHE PANTED I BESEECH YOU TO GO AWAY AH DON'T SAY THAT DON'T KILL ME HE CRIED SHE CLASPED HER HANDS HER EYES WERE STREAMING WITH TEARS
2676-143903-0113 AS YOU LOVE ME AS YOU PITY ME LEAVE ME ALONE HE GLARED AT HER A MOMENT THROUGH THE DUSK AND THE NEXT INSTANT SHE FELT HIS ARMS ABOUT HER AND HIS LIPS ON HER OWN LIPS
2676-143903-0114 HIS KISS WAS LIKE WHITE LIGHTNING A FLASH THAT SPREAD AND SPREAD AGAIN AND STAYED AND IT WAS EXTRAORDINARILY AS IF WHILE SHE TOOK IT SHE FELT EACH THING IN HIS HARD MANHOOD THAT HAD LEAST PLEASED HER
2676-143903-0115 EACH AGGRESSIVE FACT OF HIS FACE HIS FIGURE HIS PRESENCE JUSTIFIED OF ITS INTENSE IDENTITY AND MADE ONE WITH THIS ACT OF POSSESSION SO HAD SHE HEARD OF THOSE WRECKED AND UNDER WATER
2676-143903-0116 FOLLOWING A TRAIN OF IMAGES BEFORE THEY SINK BUT WHEN DARKNESS RETURNED SHE WAS FREE SHE NEVER LOOKED ABOUT HER SHE ONLY DARTED FROM THE SPOT THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE WINDOWS OF THE HOUSE THEY SHONE FAR ACROSS THE LAWN
2676-143903-0117 IN AN EXTRAORDINARILY SHORT TIME FOR THE DISTANCE WAS CONSIDERABLE SHE HAD MOVED THROUGH THE DARKNESS FOR SHE SAW NOTHING AND REACHED THE DOOR HERE ONLY SHE PAUSED SHE LOOKED ALL ABOUT HER SHE LISTENED A LITTLE
