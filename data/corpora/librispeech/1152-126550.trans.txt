1152-126550-0000 AND AT AN EARLIER HOUR THAN COMMON VISITING WARRANTS THE TWO LADIES WERE TOGETHER IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND FORTUNATELY FOR HIM LADY BERTRAM WAS ON THE VERY POINT OF QUITTING IT AS HE ENTERED SHE WAS ALMOST AT THE DOOR
1152-126550-0001 AND NOT CHUSING BY ANY MEANS TO TAKE SO MUCH TROUBLE IN VAIN SHE STILL WENT ON AFTER A CIVIL RECEPTION A SHORT SENTENCE ABOUT BEING WAITED FOR AND A LET SIR THOMAS KNOW TO THE SERVANT
1152-126550-0002 HENRY OVERJOYED TO HAVE HER GO BOWED AND WATCHED HER OFF AND WITHOUT LOSING ANOTHER MOMENT TURNED INSTANTLY TO FANNY AND TAKING OUT SOME LETTERS SAID
1152-126550-0003 WITH A MOST ANIMATED LOOK I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF INFINITELY OBLIGED TO ANY CREATURE WHO GIVES ME SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING YOU ALONE I HAVE BEEN WISHING IT MORE THAN YOU CAN HAVE ANY IDEA
1152-126550-0004 KNOWING AS I DO WHAT YOUR FEELINGS AS A SISTER ARE I COULD HARDLY HAVE BORNE THAT ANY ONE IN THE HOUSE SHOULD SHARE WITH YOU IN THE FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF THE NEWS I NOW BRING HE IS MADE YOUR BROTHER
1152-126550-0005 I HAVE THE INFINITE SATISFACTION OF CONGRATULATING YOU ON YOUR BROTHER'S PROMOTION HERE ARE THE LETTERS WHICH ANNOUNCE IT THIS MOMENT COME TO HAND YOU WILL PERHAPS LIKE TO SEE THEM
1152-126550-0006 FANNY COULD NOT SPEAK BUT HE DID NOT WANT HER TO SPEAK TO SEE THE EXPRESSION OF HER EYES THE CHANGE OF HER COMPLEXION THE PROGRESS OF HER FEELINGS THEIR DOUBT CONFUSION
1152-126550-0007 AND FELICITY WAS ENOUGH SHE TOOK THE LETTERS AS HE GAVE THEM THE FIRST WAS FROM THE ADMIRAL TO INFORM HIS NEPHEW IN A FEW WORDS OF HIS HAVING SUCCEEDED IN THE OBJECT HE HAD UNDERTAKEN
1152-126550-0008 THE PROMOTION OF YOUNG PRICE AND ENCLOSING TWO MORE ONE FROM THE SECRETARY OF THE FIRST LORD TO A FRIEND WHOM THE ADMIRAL HAD SET TO WORK IN THE BUSINESS THE OTHER FROM THAT FRIEND TO HIMSELF
1152-126550-0009 BY WHICH IT APPEARED THAT HIS LORDSHIP HAD THE VERY GREAT HAPPINESS OF ATTENDING TO THE RECOMMENDATION OF SIR CHARLES THAT SIR CHARLES WAS MUCH DELIGHTED IN HAVING SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY OF PROVING HIS REGARD FOR ADMIRAL CRAWFORD
1152-126550-0010 AND THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF MISTER WILLIAM PRICE'S COMMISSION AS SECOND LIEUTENANT OF H M SLOOP THRUSH BEING MADE OUT WAS SPREADING GENERAL JOY THROUGH A WIDE CIRCLE OF GREAT PEOPLE
1152-126550-0011 WHILE HER HAND WAS TREMBLING UNDER THESE LETTERS HER EYE RUNNING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AND HER HEART SWELLING WITH EMOTION CRAWFORD THUS CONTINUED WITH UNFEIGNED EAGERNESS TO EXPRESS HIS INTEREST IN THE EVENT
1152-126550-0012 I WILL NOT TALK OF MY OWN HAPPINESS SAID HE GREAT AS IT IS FOR I THINK ONLY OF YOURS COMPARED WITH YOU WHO HAS A RIGHT TO BE HAPPY I HAVE ALMOST GRUDGED MYSELF MY OWN PRIOR KNOWLEDGE
1152-126550-0013 OF WHAT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN BEFORE ALL THE WORLD I HAVE NOT LOST A MOMENT HOWEVER THE POST WAS LATE THIS MORNING BUT THERE HAS NOT BEEN SINCE A MOMENT'S DELAY
1152-126550-0014 HOW IMPATIENT HOW ANXIOUS HOW WILD I HAVE BEEN ON THE SUBJECT I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE HOW SEVERELY MORTIFIED HOW CRUELLY DISAPPOINTED IN NOT HAVING IT FINISHED WHILE I WAS IN LONDON
1152-126550-0015 I WAS KEPT THERE FROM DAY TO DAY IN THE HOPE OF IT FOR NOTHING LESS DEAR TO ME THAN SUCH AN OBJECT WOULD HAVE DETAINED ME HALF THE TIME FROM MANSFIELD
1152-126550-0016 BUT THOUGH MY UNCLE ENTERED INTO MY WISHES WITH ALL THE WARMTH I COULD DESIRE AND EXERTED HIMSELF IMMEDIATELY THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES FROM THE ABSENCE OF ONE FRIEND
1152-126550-0017 WHICH AT LAST I COULD NO LONGER BEAR TO STAY THE END OF AND KNOWING IN WHAT GOOD HANDS I LEFT THE CAUSE I CAME AWAY ON MONDAY TRUSTING THAT MANY POSTS WOULD NOT PASS BEFORE I SHOULD BE FOLLOWED
1152-126550-0018 BY SUCH VERY LETTERS AS THESE MY UNCLE WHO IS THE VERY BEST MAN IN THE WORLD HAS EXERTED HIMSELF AS I KNEW HE WOULD AFTER SEEING YOUR BROTHER
1152-126550-0019 HE WAS DELIGHTED WITH HIM I WOULD NOT ALLOW MYSELF YESTERDAY TO SAY HOW DELIGHTED OR TO REPEAT HALF THAT THE ADMIRAL SAID IN HIS PRAISE
1152-126550-0020 SHOULD BE PROVED THE PRAISE OF A FRIEND AS THIS DAY DOES PROVE IT NOW I MAY SAY THAT EVEN I COULD NOT REQUIRE WILLIAM PRICE TO EXCITE A GREATER INTEREST OR BE FOLLOWED BY WARMER WISHES AND HIGHER COMMENDATION
1152-126550-0021 THAN WERE MOST VOLUNTARILY BESTOWED BY MY UNCLE AFTER THE EVENING THEY HAD PASSED TOGETHER
1152-126550-0022 CRIED FANNY GOOD HEAVEN
1152-126550-0023 I BEG YOUR PARDON BUT I AM BEWILDERED DID ADMIRAL CRAWFORD APPLY HOW WAS IT
1152-126550-0024 BY BEGINNING AT AN EARLIER STAGE AND EXPLAINING VERY PARTICULARLY WHAT HE HAD DONE HIS LAST JOURNEY TO LONDON HAD BEEN UNDERTAKEN WITH NO OTHER VIEW THAN THAT OF INTRODUCING HER BROTHER IN HILL STREET
1152-126550-0025 AND PREVAILING ON THE ADMIRAL TO EXERT WHATEVER INTEREST HE MIGHT HAVE FOR GETTING HIM ON THIS HAD BEEN HIS BUSINESS HE HAD COMMUNICATED IT TO NO CREATURE HE HAD NOT BREATHED A SYLLABLE OF IT EVEN TO MARY
1152-126550-0026 HE COULD NOT HAVE BORNE ANY PARTICIPATION OF HIS FEELINGS BUT THIS HAD BEEN HIS BUSINESS AND HE SPOKE WITH SUCH A GLOW OF WHAT HIS SOLICITUDE HAD BEEN AND USED SUCH STRONG EXPRESSIONS
1152-126550-0027 WAS SO ABOUNDING IN THE DEEPEST INTEREST IN TWOFOLD MOTIVES IN VIEWS AND WISHES MORE THAN COULD BE TOLD THAT FANNY COULD NOT HAVE REMAINED INSENSIBLE OF HIS DRIFT HAD SHE BEEN ABLE TO ATTEND
1152-126550-0028 BUT HER HEART WAS SO FULL AND HER SENSES STILL SO ASTONISHED THAT SHE COULD LISTEN BUT IMPERFECTLY EVEN TO WHAT HE TOLD HER OF WILLIAM AND SAYING ONLY WHEN HE PAUSED HOW KIND
1152-126550-0029 HOW VERY KIND OH MISTER CRAWFORD WE ARE INFINITELY OBLIGED TO YOU DEAREST DEAREST WILLIAM SHE JUMPED UP AND MOVED IN HASTE TOWARDS THE DOOR CRYING OUT I WILL GO TO MY UNCLE
1152-126550-0030 MY UNCLE OUGHT TO KNOW IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT THIS COULD NOT BE SUFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY WAS TOO FAIR AND HIS FEELINGS TOO IMPATIENT HE WAS AFTER HER IMMEDIATELY SHE MUST NOT GO SHE MUST ALLOW HIM FIVE MINUTES LONGER
1152-126550-0031 AND HE TOOK HER HAND AND LED HER BACK TO HER SEAT AND WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS FARTHER EXPLANATION BEFORE SHE HAD SUSPECTED FOR WHAT SHE WAS DETAINED WHEN SHE DID UNDERSTAND IT HOWEVER
1152-126550-0032 AND FOUND HERSELF EXPECTED TO BELIEVE THAT SHE HAD CREATED SENSATIONS WHICH HIS HEART HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE AND THAT EVERYTHING HE HAD DONE FOR WILLIAM WAS TO BE PLACED TO THE ACCOUNT OF HIS EXCESSIVE
1152-126550-0033 SHE WAS EXCEEDINGLY DISTRESSED AND FOR SOME MOMENTS UNABLE TO SPEAK SHE CONSIDERED IT ALL AS NONSENSE AS MERE TRIFLING AND GALLANTRY WHICH MEANT ONLY TO DECEIVE FOR THE HOUR
1152-126550-0034 SHE COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT IT WAS TREATING HER IMPROPERLY AND UNWORTHILY AND IN SUCH A WAY AS SHE HAD NOT DESERVED BUT IT WAS LIKE HIMSELF AND ENTIRELY OF A PIECE WITH WHAT SHE HAD SEEN BEFORE
1152-126550-0035 AND SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW HERSELF TO SHEW HALF THE DISPLEASURE SHE FELT BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN CONFERRING AN OBLIGATION WHICH NO WANT OF DELICACY ON HIS PART COULD MAKE A TRIFLE TO HER
1152-126550-0036 WHILE HER HEART WAS STILL BOUNDING WITH JOY AND GRATITUDE ON WILLIAM'S BEHALF SHE COULD NOT BE SEVERELY RESENTFUL OF ANYTHING THAT INJURED ONLY HERSELF AND AFTER HAVING TWICE DRAWN BACK HER HAND AND TWICE ATTEMPTED IN VAIN
1152-126550-0037 TO TURN AWAY FROM HIM SHE GOT UP AND SAID ONLY WITH MUCH AGITATION DON'T MISTER CRAWFORD PRAY DON'T I BEG YOU WOULD NOT THIS IS A SORT OF TALKING WHICH IS VERY UNPLEASANT TO ME
1152-126550-0038 BUT HE WAS STILL TALKING ON DESCRIBING HIS AFFECTION SOLICITING A RETURN AND FINALLY IN WORDS SO PLAIN AS TO BEAR BUT ONE MEANING EVEN TO HER OFFERING HIMSELF HAND FORTUNE
1152-126550-0039 EVERYTHING TO HER ACCEPTANCE IT WAS SO HE HAD SAID IT HER ASTONISHMENT AND CONFUSION INCREASED AND THOUGH STILL NOT KNOWING HOW TO SUPPOSE HIM SERIOUS SHE COULD HARDLY STAND HE PRESSED FOR AN ANSWER
1152-126550-0040 NO NO NO SHE CRIED HIDING HER FACE THIS IS ALL NONSENSE
1152-126550-0041 YOUR KINDNESS TO WILLIAM MAKES ME MORE OBLIGED TO YOU THAN WORDS CAN EXPRESS BUT I DO NOT WANT I CANNOT BEAR
1152-126550-0042 SHE HAD BURST AWAY FROM HIM AND AT THAT MOMENT SIR THOMAS WAS HEARD SPEAKING TO A SERVANT IN HIS WAY TOWARDS THE ROOM THEY WERE IN IT WAS NO TIME FOR FARTHER ASSURANCES OR ENTREATY
1152-126550-0043 THOUGH TO PART WITH HER AT A MOMENT WHEN HER MODESTY ALONE SEEMED TO HIS SANGUINE AND PREASSURED MIND TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THE HAPPINESS HE SOUGHT WAS A CRUEL NECESSITY
1152-126550-0044 SHE RUSHED OUT AT AN OPPOSITE DOOR FROM THE ONE HER UNCLE WAS APPROACHING AND WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE EAST ROOM
1152-126550-0045 BEFORE SIR THOMAS'S POLITENESS OR APOLOGIES WERE OVER OR HE HAD REACHED THE BEGINNING OF THE JOYFUL INTELLIGENCE WHICH HIS VISITOR CAME TO COMMUNICATE SHE WAS FEELING THINKING TREMBLING ABOUT EVERYTHING
1152-126550-0046 INFINITELY OBLIGED ABSOLUTELY ANGRY IT WAS ALL BEYOND BELIEF HE WAS INEXCUSABLE INCOMPREHENSIBLE BUT SUCH WERE HIS HABITS THAT HE COULD DO NOTHING WITHOUT A MIXTURE OF EVIL
1152-126550-0047 HE HAD PREVIOUSLY MADE HER THE HAPPIEST OF HUMAN BEINGS AND NOW HE HAD INSULTED SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO SAY HOW TO CLASS OR HOW TO REGARD IT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HIM BE SERIOUS AND YET
