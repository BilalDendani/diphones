7313-91072-0005 HE SOON STOOD AT THE HEAD OF HIS LITTLE CLASS IN SPELLING AND READING AND TOOK IT SO MUCH TO HEART WHEN HE DID HAPPEN TO LOSE HIS PLACE THAT HE WOULD CRY BITTERLY
7313-91072-0006 WHEN THEY HAD GAINED THE RIGHT TO GET ABOVE HIM DECLINED THE HONOR BECAUSE IT HURT HORACE'S FEELINGS SO BEFORE HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD HE HAD READ THE BIBLE THROUGH AND PILGRIM'S PROGRESS THEIR HOME CONTAINED ONLY ABOUT TWENTY BOOKS
