348-128030-0000 IN NORTHUMBERLAND THE TRIUMPH OF SIR JOHN FENWICK A COURTIER WHOSE NAME AFTERWARDS OBTAINED A MELANCHOLY CELEBRITY WAS ATTENDED BY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH EXCITED INTEREST IN LONDON
348-128030-0001 NEWCASTLE WAS LIGHTED UP WITH GREAT PILES OF COAL
348-128030-0002 SECURE OF PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT HE MIGHT NOW INDULGE IN THE LUXURY OF REVENGE HIS NATURE WAS NOT PLACABLE AND WHILE STILL A SUBJECT HE HAD SUFFERED SOME INJURIES AND INDIGNITIES
348-128030-0003 WHICH MIGHT MOVE EVEN A PLACABLE NATURE TO FIERCE AND LASTING RESENTMENT ONE SET OF MEN IN PARTICULAR HAD WITH A BASENESS AND CRUELTY BEYOND ALL EXAMPLE AND ALL DESCRIPTION ATTACKED HIS HONOUR AND HIS LIFE
348-128030-0004 THE WITNESSES OF THE PLOT HE MAY WELL BE EXCUSED FOR HATING THEM
348-128030-0005 TWO BILLS OF INDICTMENT AGAINST HIM FOR PERJURY HAD BEEN FOUND BY THE GRAND JURY OF MIDDLESEX A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE DEATH OF CHARLES SOON AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE ELECTIONS THE TRIAL CAME ON AMONG THE UPPER AND MIDDLE CLASSES
348-128030-0006 OATES HAD FEW FRIENDS LEFT THE MOST RESPECTABLE WHIGS WERE NOW CONVINCED THAT EVEN IF HIS NARRATIVE HAD SOME FOUNDATION IN FACT HE HAD ERECTED ON THAT FOUNDATION A VAST SUPERSTRUCTURE OF ROMANCE A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF LOW FANATICS HOWEVER
348-128030-0007 STILL REGARDED HIM AS A PUBLIC BENEFACTOR THESE PEOPLE WELL KNEW THAT IF HE WERE CONVICTED HIS SENTENCE WOULD BE ONE OF EXTREME SEVERITY AND WERE THEREFORE INDEFATIGABLE IN THEIR ENDEAVOURS TO MANAGE AN ESCAPE
348-128030-0008 THOUGH HE WAS AS YET IN CONFINEMENT ONLY FOR DEBT HE WAS PUT INTO IRONS BY THE AUTHORITIES OF THE KING'S BENCH PRISON AND EVEN SO HE WAS WITH DIFFICULTY KEPT IN SAFE CUSTODY THE MASTIFF THAT GUARDED HIS DOOR WAS POISONED
348-128030-0009 AND ON THE VERY NIGHT PRECEDING THE TRIAL A LADDER OF ROPES WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE CELL
348-128030-0010 WESTMINSTER HALL WAS CROWDED WITH SPECTATORS AMONG WHOM WERE MANY ROMAN CATHOLICS
348-128030-0011 HIS LEGS UNEVEN THE VULGAR SAID AS THOSE OF A BADGER HIS FOREHEAD LOW AS THAT OF A BABOON HIS PURPLE CHEEKS AND HIS MONSTROUS LENGTH OF CHIN HAD BEEN FAMILIAR TO ALL WHO FREQUENTED THE COURTS OF LAW HE HAD THEN BEEN THE IDOL OF THE NATION
348-128030-0012 WHEREVER HE HAD APPEARED MEN HAD UNCOVERED THEIR HEADS TO HIM THE LIVES AND ESTATES OF THE MAGNATES OF THE REALM HAD BEEN AT HIS MERCY TIMES HAD NOW CHANGED
348-128030-0013 ONE OF THEM THE EARL OF HUNTINGDON BITTERLY REPROACHED HIM WITH HAVING DECEIVED THE HOUSES AND DRAWN ON THEM THE GUILT OF SHEDDING INNOCENT BLOOD THE JUDGES BROWBEAT AND REVILED THE PRISONER WITH AN INTEMPERANCE WHICH
348-128030-0014 EVEN IN THE MOST ATROCIOUS CASES ILL BECOMES THE JUDICIAL CHARACTER HE BETRAYED HOWEVER NO SIGN OF FEAR OR OF SHAME AND FACED THE STORM OF INVECTIVE WHICH BURST UPON HIM FROM BAR BENCH AND WITNESS BOX
348-128030-0015 WITH THE INSOLENCE OF DESPAIR HE WAS CONVICTED ON BOTH INDICTMENTS HIS OFFENCE THOUGH IN A MORAL LIGHT MURDER OF THE MOST AGGRAVATED KIND WAS IN THE EYE OF THE LAW MERELY A MISDEMEANOUR THE TRIBUNAL HOWEVER
348-128030-0016 WAS DESIROUS TO MAKE HIS PUNISHMENT MORE SEVERE THAN THAT OF FELONS OR TRAITORS AND NOT MERELY TO PUT HIM TO DEATH BUT TO PUT HIM TO DEATH BY FRIGHTFUL TORMENTS HE WAS SENTENCED TO BE STRIPPED OF HIS CLERICAL HABIT TO BE PILLORIED IN PALACE YARD
348-128030-0017 TO BE LED ROUND WESTMINSTER HALL WITH AN INSCRIPTION DECLARING HIS INFAMY OVER HIS HEAD TO BE PILLORIED AGAIN IN FRONT OF THE ROYAL EXCHANGE TO BE WHIPPED FROM ALDGATE TO NEWGATE AND AFTER AN INTERVAL OF TWO DAYS
348-128030-0018 HE WAS BROUGHT FORTH TO UNDERGO HIS FIRST FLOGGING AT AN EARLY HOUR AN INNUMERABLE MULTITUDE FILLED ALL THE STREETS FROM ALDGATE TO THE OLD BAILEY THE HANGMAN LAID ON THE LASH WITH SUCH UNUSUAL SEVERITY AS SHOWED THAT HE HAD RECEIVED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
348-128030-0019 THE BLOOD RAN DOWN IN RIVULETS FOR A TIME THE CRIMINAL SHOWED A STRANGE CONSTANCY BUT AT LAST HIS STUBBORN FORTITUDE GAVE WAY HIS BELLOWINGS WERE FRIGHTFUL TO HEAR HE SWOONED SEVERAL TIMES BUT THE SCOURGE STILL CONTINUED TO DESCEND
348-128030-0020 WHEN HE WAS UNBOUND IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD BORNE AS MUCH AS THE HUMAN FRAME CAN BEAR WITHOUT DISSOLUTION JAMES WAS ENTREATED TO REMIT THE SECOND FLOGGING HIS ANSWER WAS SHORT AND CLEAR HE SHALL GO THROUGH WITH IT IF HE HAS BREATH IN HIS BODY
348-128030-0021 AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO OBTAIN THE QUEEN'S INTERCESSION BUT SHE INDIGNANTLY REFUSED TO SAY A WORD IN FAVOUR OF SUCH A WRETCH AFTER AN INTERVAL OF ONLY FORTY EIGHT HOURS OATES WAS AGAIN BROUGHT OUT OF HIS DUNGEON HE WAS UNABLE TO STAND
348-128030-0022 AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO DRAG HIM TO TYBURN ON A SLEDGE
348-128030-0023 A PERSON WHO COUNTED THE STRIPES ON THE SECOND DAY SAID THAT THEY WERE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED THE BAD MAN ESCAPED WITH LIFE BUT SO NARROWLY THAT HIS IGNORANT AND BIGOTED ADMIRERS THOUGHT HIS RECOVERY MIRACULOUS
348-128030-0024 THE DOORS OF THE PRISON CLOSED UPON HIM DURING MANY MONTHS HE REMAINED IRONED IN THE DARKEST HOLE OF NEWGATE IT WAS SAID THAT IN HIS CELL HE GAVE HIMSELF UP TO MELANCHOLY AND SATE WHOLE DAYS UTTERING DEEP GROANS
348-128030-0025 HIS ARMS FOLDED AND HIS HAT PULLED OVER HIS EYES IT WAS NOT IN ENGLAND ALONE THAT THESE EVENTS EXCITED STRONG INTEREST MILLIONS OF ROMAN CATHOLICS WHO KNEW NOTHING OF OUR INSTITUTIONS OR OF OUR FACTIONS
348-128030-0026 HAD HEARD THAT A PERSECUTION OF SINGULAR BARBARITY HAD RAGED IN OUR ISLAND AGAINST THE PROFESSORS OF THE TRUE FAITH THAT MANY PIOUS MEN HAD SUFFERED MARTYRDOM AND THAT TITUS OATES HAD BEEN THE CHIEF MURDERER THERE WAS THEREFORE
348-128030-0027 GREAT JOY IN DISTANT COUNTRIES WHEN IT WAS KNOWN THAT THE DIVINE JUSTICE HAD OVERTAKEN HIM ENGRAVINGS OF HIM LOOKING OUT FROM THE PILLORY AND WRITHING AT THE CART'S TAIL WERE CIRCULATED ALL OVER EUROPE AND EPIGRAMMATISTS IN MANY LANGUAGES
348-128030-0028 THE WORST OF MURDERERS TO THE GUILT OF SHEDDING INNOCENT BLOOD
348-128030-0029 INTO WHICH MAN CAN ENTER WITH HIS FELLOW MEN AND OF MAKING INSTITUTIONS TO WHICH IT IS DESIRABLE THAT THE PUBLIC SHOULD LOOK WITH RESPECT AND CONFIDENCE INSTRUMENTS OF FRIGHTFUL WRONG AND OBJECTS OF GENERAL DISTRUST
348-128030-0030 THE PAIN PRODUCED BY ORDINARY MURDER BEARS NO PROPORTION TO THE PAIN PRODUCED BY MURDER OF WHICH THE COURTS OF JUSTICE ARE MADE THE AGENTS THE MERE EXTINCTION OF LIFE IS A VERY SMALL PART OF WHAT MAKES AN EXECUTION HORRIBLE
348-128030-0031 THE PROLONGED MENTAL AGONY OF THE SUFFERER THE SHAME AND MISERY OF ALL CONNECTED WITH HIM THE STAIN ABIDING EVEN TO THE THIRD AND FOURTH GENERATION ARE THINGS FAR MORE DREADFUL THAN DEATH ITSELF IN GENERAL IT MAY BE SAFELY AFFIRMED
348-128030-0032 THAT THE FATHER OF A LARGE FAMILY WOULD RATHER BE BEREAVED OF ALL HIS CHILDREN BY ACCIDENT OR BY DISEASE THAN LOSE ONE OF THEM BY THE HANDS OF THE HANGMAN MURDER BY FALSE TESTIMONY IS THEREFORE THE MOST AGGRAVATED SPECIES OF MURDER
348-128030-0033 AND OATES HAD BEEN GUILTY OF MANY SUCH MURDERS NEVERTHELESS THE PUNISHMENT WHICH WAS INFLICTED UPON HIM CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED IN SENTENCING HIM TO BE STRIPPED OF HIS ECCLESIASTICAL HABIT AND IMPRISONED FOR LIFE THE JUDGES EXCEEDED THEIR LEGAL POWER
348-128030-0034 THEY WERE UNDOUBTEDLY COMPETENT TO INFLICT WHIPPING NOR HAD THE LAW ASSIGNED A LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF STRIPES BUT THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW CLEARLY WAS THAT NO MISDEMEANOUR SHOULD BE PUNISHED MORE SEVERELY THAN THE MOST ATROCIOUS FELONIES
348-128030-0035 THE WORST FELON COULD ONLY BE HANGED THE JUDGES AS THEY BELIEVED SENTENCED OATES TO BE SCOURGED TO DEATH THAT THE LAW WAS DEFECTIVE IS NOT A SUFFICIENT EXCUSE FOR DEFECTIVE LAWS SHOULD BE ALTERED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND NOT STRAINED BY THE TRIBUNALS
348-128030-0036 THAT OATES WAS A BAD MAN IS NOT A SUFFICIENT EXCUSE FOR THE GUILTY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS THE FIRST TO SUFFER THOSE HARDSHIPS WHICH ARE AFTERWARDS USED AS PRECEDENTS AGAINST THE INNOCENT THUS IT WAS IN THE PRESENT CASE
348-128030-0037 MERCILESS FLOGGING SOON BECAME AN ORDINARY PUNISHMENT FOR POLITICAL MISDEMEANOURS OF NO VERY AGGRAVATED KIND
348-128030-0038 TO PAINS SO EXCRUCIATING THAT THEY WITH UNFEIGNED EARNESTNESS BEGGED TO BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL ON CAPITAL CHARGES AND SENT TO THE GALLOWS HAPPILY THE PROGRESS OF THIS GREAT EVIL WAS SPEEDILY STOPPED BY THE REVOLUTION
