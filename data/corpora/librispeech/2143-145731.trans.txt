2143-145731-0000 IN A CERTAIN VILLAGE THERE LIVED TWO PEOPLE WHO HAD BOTH THE SAME NAME BOTH WERE CALLED KLAUS BUT ONE OWNED FOUR HORSES AND THE OTHER ONLY ONE IN ORDER TO DISTINGUISH THE ONE FROM THE OTHER
2143-145731-0001 THE ONE WHO HAD FOUR HORSES WAS CALLED BIG KLAUS AND THE ONE WHO HAD ONLY ONE HORSE LITTLE KLAUS NOW YOU SHALL HEAR WHAT BEFELL THEM BOTH FOR THIS IS A TRUE STORY THE WHOLE WEEK THROUGH
2143-145731-0002 LITTLE KLAUS HAD TO PLOUGH FOR BIG KLAUS AND LEND HIM HIS ONE HORSE THEN BIG KLAUS LENT HIM HIS FOUR HORSES BUT ONLY ONCE A WEEK AND THAT WAS ON SUNDAY
2143-145731-0003 OVER ALL THE FIVE HORSES FOR THEY WERE INDEED AS GOOD AS HIS ON THIS ONE DAY THE SUN SHONE BRIGHTLY AND ALL THE BELLS IN THE CHURCH TOWERS WERE PEALING THE PEOPLE WERE DRESSED IN THEIR BEST CLOTHES AND WERE GOING TO CHURCH
2143-145731-0004 WITH THEIR HYMN BOOKS UNDER THEIR ARMS TO HEAR THE MINISTER PREACH THEY SAW LITTLE KLAUS PLOUGHING WITH THE FIVE HORSES BUT HE WAS SO HAPPY THAT HE KEPT ON CRACKING HIS WHIP AND CALLING OUT
2143-145731-0005 YOU MUSTN'T SAY THAT SAID BIG KLAUS ONLY ONE HORSE IS YOURS BUT AS SOON AS SOMEONE ELSE WAS GOING BY LITTLE KLAUS FORGOT THAT HE MUST NOT SAY IT AND CALLED OUT
2143-145731-0006 NOW YOU HAD BETTER STOP THAT SAID BIG KLAUS FOR IF YOU SAY IT ONCE MORE I WILL GIVE YOUR HORSE SUCH A CRACK ON THE HEAD THAT IT WILL DROP DOWN DEAD ON THE SPOT I REALLY WON'T SAY IT AGAIN SAID LITTLE KLAUS
2143-145731-0007 BUT AS SOON AS MORE PEOPLE PASSED BY AND NODDED HIM GOOD MORNING
2143-145731-0008 I'LL SEE TO YOUR HORSES SAID BIG KLAUS
2143-145731-0009 ALAS NOW I HAVE NO HORSE
2143-145731-0010 THEN HE FLAYED THE SKIN OFF HIS HORSE DRIED IT AND PUT IT IN A SACK WHICH HE THREW OVER HIS SHOULDER AND WENT INTO THE TOWN TO SELL IT HE HAD A LONG WAY TO GO AND HAD TO PASS THROUGH A GREAT DARK FOREST A DREADFUL
2143-145731-0011 STORM CAME ON IN WHICH HE LOST HIS WAY
2143-145731-0012 NIGHT CAME ON AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH THE TOWN THAT EVENING RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM WAS A LARGE FARM HOUSE THE WINDOW SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED BUT THE LIGHT CAME THROUGH THE CHINKS
2143-145731-0013 I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO BE ALLOWED TO SPEND THE NIGHT THERE THOUGHT LITTLE KLAUS AND HE WENT AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR THE FARMER'S WIFE OPENED IT
2143-145731-0014 HER HUSBAND WAS NOT AT HOME AND SHE TOOK IN NO STRANGERS WELL I MUST LIE DOWN OUTSIDE SAID LITTLE KLAUS
2143-145731-0015 AND HE COULD JUST SEE INTO THE ROOM THERE STOOD A LARGE TABLE SPREAD WITH WINE AND ROAST MEAT AND A BEAUTIFUL FISH THE FARMER'S WIFE AND THE SEXTON SAT AT THE TABLE BUT THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE
2143-145731-0016 SHE WAS FILLING UP HIS GLASS WHILE HE STUCK HIS FORK INTO THE FISH WHICH WAS HIS FAVOURITE DISH IF ONE COULD ONLY GET SOME OF THAT
2143-145731-0017 AH WHAT DELICIOUS CAKES HE SAW STANDING THERE IT WAS A FEAST THEN HE HEARD SOMEONE RIDING ALONG THE ROAD TOWARDS THE HOUSE IT WAS THE FARMER COMING HOME HE WAS A VERY WORTHY MAN
2143-145731-0018 BUT HE HAD ONE GREAT PECULIARITY NAMELY THAT HE COULD NOT BEAR TO SEE A SEXTON IF HE SAW ONE HE WAS MADE QUITE MAD THAT WAS WHY THE SEXTON HAD GONE TO SAY GOOD DAY TO THE FARMER'S WIFE WHEN HE KNEW THAT HER HUSBAND WAS NOT AT HOME
2143-145731-0019 AND THE GOOD WOMAN THEREFORE PUT IN FRONT OF HIM THE BEST FOOD SHE HAD BUT WHEN THEY HEARD THE FARMER COMING THEY WERE FRIGHTENED
2143-145731-0020 HE DID SO AS HE KNEW THE POOR MAN COULD NOT BEAR TO SEE A SEXTON
2143-145731-0021 WHEN HE SAW THE GOOD FOOD DISAPPEARING IS ANYBODY UP THERE ASKED THE FARMER CATCHING SIGHT OF LITTLE KLAUS WHY ARE YOU LYING THERE COME WITH ME INTO THE HOUSE

2143-145731-0023 AND ATE WITH A GOOD APPETITE BUT LITTLE KLAUS COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF THE DELICIOUS DISHES OF FISH AND ROAST MEATS AND CAKES WHICH HE KNEW WERE IN THE OVEN
2143-145731-0024 THE PORRIDGE DID NOT TASTE GOOD TO HIM SO HE TROD UPON HIS SACK AND THE DRY SKIN IN THE SACK SQUEAKED LOUDLY HUSH SAID LITTLE KLAUS
2143-145731-0025 HE SAYS WE SHOULD NOT EAT PORRIDGE FOR HE HAS CONJURED THE WHOLE OVEN FULL OF ROAST MEATS AND FISH AND CAKES

2143-145731-0031 I SAY SAID THE FARMER HE MUST BE UGLY YOU MUST KNOW THAT I CAN'T BEAR TO LOOK AT A SEXTON BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER I KNOW THAT IT IS THE DEVIL AND I SHA'N'T MIND I FEEL UP TO IT NOW BUT HE MUST NOT COME TOO NEAR ME
2143-145731-0032 I MUST ASK MY WIZARD SAID LITTLE KLAUS TREADING ON THE SACK AND PUTTING HIS EAR TO IT
2143-145731-0033 HE SAYS YOU CAN OPEN THE CHEST IN THE CORNER THERE AND YOU WILL SEE THE DEVIL SQUATTING INSIDE IT BUT YOU MUST HOLD THE LID SO THAT HE SHALL NOT ESCAPE
2143-145731-0034 BEGGED THE FARMER GOING TOWARDS THE CHEST WHERE HIS WIFE HAD HIDDEN THE REAL SEXTON
2143-145731-0035 YES NOW I HAVE SEEN HIM HE LOOKED JUST LIKE OUR SEXTON OH IT WAS HORRID SO HE HAD TO DRINK AGAIN

2143-145731-0068 LITTLE KLAUS COULD NOT GET OUT AND EVERYBODY WAS IN CHURCH
2143-145731-0069 OH DEAR OH DEAR GROANED LITTLE KLAUS IN THE SACK TWISTING AND TURNING HIMSELF BUT HE COULD NOT UNDO THE STRING THERE CAME BY AN OLD OLD SHEPHERD WITH SNOW WHITE HAIR AND A LONG STAFF IN HIS HAND
2143-145731-0070 HE WAS DRIVING A HERD OF COWS AND OXEN
2143-145731-0071 AND I POOR MAN SAID THE CATTLE DRIVER

2143-145731-0074 SOON AFTER BIG KLAUS CAME OUT OF THE CHURCH AND TAKING UP THE SACK ON HIS SHOULDERS IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF IT HAD BECOME LIGHTER FOR THE OLD CATTLE DRIVER WAS NOT HALF AS HEAVY AS LITTLE KLAUS HOW EASY HE IS TO CARRY NOW
2143-145731-0075 THAT MUST BE BECAUSE I HEARD PART OF THE SERVICE
2143-145731-0076 WHICH WAS DEEP AND BROAD THREW IN THE SACK WITH THE OLD DRIVER AND CALLED AFTER IT FOR HE THOUGHT LITTLE KLAUS WAS INSIDE DOWN YOU GO YOU WON'T MOCK ME ANY MORE NOW THEN HE WENT HOME
2143-145731-0077 BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE CROSS ROADS THERE HE MET LITTLE KLAUS WHO WAS DRIVING HIS CATTLE
2143-145731-0078 SAID BIG KLAUS HAVEN'T I DROWNED YOU YES REPLIED LITTLE KLAUS YOU THREW ME INTO THE RIVER A GOOD HALF HOUR AGO BUT HOW DID YOU GET THOSE SPLENDID CATTLE ASKED BIG KLAUS THEY ARE SEA CATTLE
2143-145731-0079 AND I THANK YOU FOR HAVING DROWNED ME BECAUSE NOW I AM ON DRY LAND AND REALLY RICH HOW FRIGHTENED I WAS WHEN I WAS IN THE SACK
2143-145731-0080 HOW THE WIND WHISTLED IN MY EARS AS YOU THREW ME FROM THE BRIDGE INTO THE COLD WATER I SANK AT ONCE TO THE BOTTOM BUT I DID NOT HURT MYSELF FOR UNDERNEATH WAS GROWING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SOFT GRASS
2143-145731-0081 I FELL ON THIS AND IMMEDIATELY THE SACK OPENED THE LOVELIEST MAIDEN IN SNOW WHITE GARMENTS WITH A GREEN GARLAND ROUND HER WET HAIR TOOK ME BY THE HAND AND SAID
2143-145731-0082 AND A MILE FARTHER DOWN THE ROAD THERE IS ANOTHER HERD WHICH I WILL GIVE YOU AS A PRESENT NOW I SAW THAT THE RIVER WAS A GREAT HIGH ROAD FOR THE SEA PEOPLE ALONG IT THEY TRAVEL
2143-145731-0083 IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL FULL OF FLOWERS AND FRESH GRASS THE FISHES WHICH WERE SWIMMING IN THE WATER SHOT PAST MY EARS AS THE BIRDS DO HERE IN THE AIR
2143-145731-0084 BUT WHY DID YOU COME UP TO US AGAIN ASKED BIG KLAUS
2143-145731-0085 OH SAID LITTLE KLAUS THAT WAS JUST SO POLITIC OF ME YOU HEARD WHAT I TOLD YOU THAT THE SEA MAIDEN SAID TO ME A MILE FARTHER ALONG THE ROAD AND BY THE ROAD SHE MEANT THE RIVER FOR SHE CAN GO BY NO OTHER WAY
2143-145731-0086 THERE WAS ANOTHER HERD OF CATTLE WAITING FOR ME BUT I KNOW WHAT WINDINGS THE RIVER MAKES NOW HERE NOW THERE
2143-145731-0087 THEREFORE IT MAKES IT MUCH SHORTER IF ONE COMES ON THE LAND AND DRIVES ACROSS THE FIELD TO THE RIVER
2143-145731-0088 SAID BIG KLAUS DO YOU THINK I SHOULD ALSO
2143-145731-0089 OH YES I THINK SO
2143-145731-0090 BUT I CAN'T CARRY YOU IN A SACK TO THE RIVER YOU ARE TOO HEAVY FOR ME
2143-145731-0091 THANK YOU SAID BIG KLAUS BUT IF I DON'T GET ANY SEA CATTLE WHEN I COME THERE YOU WILL HAVE A GOOD HIDING MIND OH NO DON'T BE SO HARD ON ME THEN THEY WENT TO THE RIVER
2143-145731-0092 YES BUT HELP ME FIRST SAID BIG KLAUS OR ELSE YOU SHALL HAVE A BEATING AND SO HE CREPT INTO THE LARGE SACK WHICH WAS LYING ON THE BACK OF ONE OF THE OXEN
2143-145731-0093 PUT A STONE IN FOR I AM AFRAID I MAY NOT REACH THE BOTTOM SAID BIG KLAUS IT GOES ALL RIGHT SAID LITTLE KLAUS BUT STILL HE LAID A BIG STONE IN THE SACK FASTENED IT UP TIGHT AND THEN PUSHED IT IN
2143-145731-0094 PLUMP THERE WAS BIG KLAUS IN THE WATER AND HE SANK LIKE LEAD TO THE BOTTOM
