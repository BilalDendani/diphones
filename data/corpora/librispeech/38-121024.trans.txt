38-121024-0000 HE WAS SUSTAINED AT FIRST BY THAT PRIDE OF CONSCIOUS INNOCENCE WHICH IS THE SEQUENCE TO HOPE THEN HE BEGAN TO DOUBT HIS OWN INNOCENCE WHICH JUSTIFIED IN SOME MEASURE THE GOVERNOR'S BELIEF IN HIS MENTAL ALIENATION AND THEN RELAXING HIS SENTIMENT OF PRIDE
38-121024-0001 HE ADDRESSED HIS SUPPLICATIONS NOT TO GOD BUT TO MAN GOD IS ALWAYS THE LAST RESOURCE UNFORTUNATES WHO OUGHT TO BEGIN WITH GOD DO NOT HAVE ANY HOPE IN HIM TILL THEY HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL OTHER MEANS OF DELIVERANCE
38-121024-0002 FOR A CHANGE HOWEVER DISADVANTAGEOUS WAS STILL A CHANGE AND WOULD AFFORD HIM SOME AMUSEMENT HE ENTREATED TO BE ALLOWED TO WALK ABOUT TO HAVE FRESH AIR BOOKS AND WRITING MATERIALS HIS REQUESTS WERE NOT GRANTED
38-121024-0003 BUT HE WENT ON ASKING ALL THE SAME HE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SPEAKING TO THE NEW JAILER ALTHOUGH THE LATTER WAS IF POSSIBLE MORE TACITURN THAN THE OLD ONE BUT STILL TO SPEAK TO A MAN EVEN THOUGH MUTE WAS SOMETHING
38-121024-0004 DANTES SPOKE FOR THE SAKE OF HEARING HIS OWN VOICE HE HAD TRIED TO SPEAK WHEN ALONE BUT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE TERRIFIED HIM OFTEN BEFORE HIS CAPTIVITY
38-121024-0005 DANTES MIND HAD REVOLTED AT THE IDEA OF ASSEMBLAGES OF PRISONERS MADE UP OF THIEVES VAGABONDS AND MURDERERS HE NOW WISHED TO BE AMONGST THEM IN ORDER TO SEE SOME OTHER FACE BESIDES THAT OF HIS JAILER
38-121024-0006 HE SIGHED FOR THE GALLEYS WITH THE INFAMOUS COSTUME THE CHAIN AND THE BRAND ON THE SHOULDER THE GALLEY SLAVES BREATHED THE FRESH AIR OF HEAVEN AND SAW EACH OTHER THEY WERE VERY HAPPY HE BESOUGHT THE JAILER ONE DAY TO LET HIM HAVE A COMPANION WERE IT EVEN THE MAD ABBE
38-121024-0007 AND HE LAID THE REQUEST OF NUMBER THIRTY FOUR BEFORE THE GOVERNOR BUT THE LATTER SAPIENTLY IMAGINED THAT DANTES WISHED TO CONSPIRE OR ATTEMPT AN ESCAPE AND REFUSED HIS REQUEST DANTES HAD EXHAUSTED ALL HUMAN RESOURCES
38-121024-0008 AND HE THEN TURNED TO GOD ALL THE PIOUS IDEAS THAT HAD BEEN SO LONG FORGOTTEN RETURNED HE RECOLLECTED THE PRAYERS HIS MOTHER HAD TAUGHT HIM
38-121024-0009 AND DISCOVERED A NEW MEANING IN EVERY WORD FOR IN PROSPERITY PRAYERS SEEM BUT A MERE MEDLEY OF WORDS UNTIL MISFORTUNE COMES AND THE UNHAPPY SUFFERER FIRST UNDERSTANDS THE MEANING
38-121024-0010 PROPOSED TASKS TO ACCOMPLISH AND AT THE END OF EVERY PRAYER INTRODUCED THE ENTREATY OFTENER ADDRESSED TO MAN THAN TO GOD FORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSES AS WE FORGIVE THEM THAT TRESPASS AGAINST US
38-121024-0011 YET IN SPITE OF HIS EARNEST PRAYERS DANTES REMAINED A PRISONER THEN GLOOM SETTLED HEAVILY UPON HIM
38-121024-0012 AND WITHOUT EDUCATION HE COULD NOT THEREFORE IN THE SOLITUDE OF HIS DUNGEON TRAVERSE IN MENTAL VISION THE HISTORY OF THE AGES BRING TO LIFE THE NATIONS THAT HAD PERISHED
38-121024-0013 AND REBUILD THE ANCIENT CITIES SO VAST AND STUPENDOUS IN THE LIGHT OF THE IMAGINATION AND THAT PASS BEFORE THE EYE GLOWING WITH CELESTIAL COLORS IN MARTIN'S BABYLONIAN PICTURES HE COULD NOT DO THIS HE WHOSE PAST LIFE WAS SO SHORT
38-121024-0014 WHOSE PRESENT SO MELANCHOLY AND HIS FUTURE SO DOUBTFUL NINETEEN YEARS OF LIGHT TO REFLECT UPON IN ETERNAL DARKNESS NO DISTRACTION COULD COME TO HIS AID
38-121024-0015 HIS ENERGETIC SPIRIT THAT WOULD HAVE EXALTED IN THUS REVISITING THE PAST WAS IMPRISONED LIKE AN EAGLE IN A CAGE HE CLUNG TO ONE IDEA THAT OF HIS HAPPINESS DESTROYED WITHOUT APPARENT CAUSE BY AN UNHEARD OF FATALITY
38-121024-0016 DEVOURED IT SO TO SPEAK AS THE IMPLACABLE UGOLINO DEVOURS THE SKULL OF ARCHBISHOP ROGER IN THE INFERNO OF DANTE RAGE SUPPLANTED RELIGIOUS FERVOR
38-121024-0017 DANTES UTTERED BLASPHEMIES THAT MADE HIS JAILER RECOIL WITH HORROR DASHED HIMSELF FURIOUSLY AGAINST THE WALLS OF HIS PRISON WREAKED HIS ANGER UPON EVERYTHING AND CHIEFLY UPON HIMSELF
38-121024-0018 SO THAT THE LEAST THING A GRAIN OF SAND A STRAW OR A BREATH OF AIR THAT ANNOYED HIM LED TO PAROXYSMS OF FURY THEN THE LETTER THAT VILLEFORT HAD SHOWED TO HIM RECURRED TO HIS MIND
38-121024-0019 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IT WAS THE ENMITY OF MAN AND NOT THE VENGEANCE OF HEAVEN THAT HAD THUS PLUNGED HIM INTO THE DEEPEST MISERY HE CONSIGNED HIS UNKNOWN PERSECUTORS TO THE MOST HORRIBLE TORTURES HE COULD IMAGINE AND FOUND THEM ALL INSUFFICIENT
38-121024-0020 BECAUSE AFTER TORTURE CAME DEATH AND AFTER DEATH IF NOT REPOSE AT LEAST THE BOON OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS BY DINT OF CONSTANTLY DWELLING ON THE IDEA THAT TRANQUILLITY WAS DEATH
38-121024-0021 AND IF PUNISHMENT WERE THE END IN VIEW OTHER TORTURES THAN DEATH MUST BE INVENTED HE BEGAN TO REFLECT ON SUICIDE UNHAPPY HE WHO ON THE BRINK OF MISFORTUNE BROODS OVER IDEAS LIKE THESE
38-121024-0022 BEFORE HIM IS A DEAD SEA THAT STRETCHES IN AZURE CALM BEFORE THE EYE BUT HE WHO UNWARILY VENTURES WITHIN ITS EMBRACE FINDS HIMSELF STRUGGLING WITH A MONSTER THAT WOULD DRAG HIM DOWN TO PERDITION ONCE THUS ENSNARED
38-121024-0023 UNLESS THE PROTECTING HAND OF GOD SNATCH HIM THENCE ALL IS OVER AND HIS STRUGGLES BUT TEND TO HASTEN HIS DESTRUCTION THIS STATE OF MENTAL ANGUISH IS HOWEVER LESS TERRIBLE THAN THE SUFFERINGS THAT PRECEDE
38-121024-0024 OR THE PUNISHMENT THAT POSSIBLY WILL FOLLOW THERE IS A SORT OF CONSOLATION AT THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE YAWNING ABYSS AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH LIE DARKNESS AND OBSCURITY EDMOND FOUND SOME SOLACE IN THESE IDEAS
38-121024-0025 ALL HIS SORROWS ALL HIS SUFFERINGS WITH THEIR TRAIN OF GLOOMY SPECTRES FLED FROM HIS CELL WHEN THE ANGEL OF DEATH SEEMED ABOUT TO ENTER DANTES REVIEWED HIS PAST LIFE WITH COMPOSURE
38-121024-0026 AND LOOKING FORWARD WITH TERROR TO HIS FUTURE EXISTENCE CHOSE THAT MIDDLE LINE THAT SEEMED TO AFFORD HIM A REFUGE SOMETIMES SAID HE IN MY VOYAGES WHEN I WAS A MAN AND COMMANDED OTHER MEN
38-121024-0027 I HAVE SEEN THE HEAVENS OVERCAST THE SEA RAGE AND FOAM THE STORM ARISE AND LIKE A MONSTROUS BIRD BEATING THE TWO HORIZONS WITH ITS WINGS THEN I FELT THAT MY VESSEL WAS A VAIN REFUGE THAT TREMBLED AND SHOOK BEFORE THE TEMPEST
38-121024-0028 SOON THE FURY OF THE WAVES AND THE SIGHT OF THE SHARP ROCKS ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF DEATH AND DEATH THEN TERRIFIED ME AND I USED ALL MY SKILL AND INTELLIGENCE AS A MAN AND A SAILOR TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THE WRATH OF GOD BUT I DID SO BECAUSE I WAS HAPPY
38-121024-0029 I HAVE LOST ALL THAT BOUND ME TO LIFE DEATH SMILES AND INVITES ME TO REPOSE I DIE AFTER MY OWN MANNER I DIE EXHAUSTED AND BROKEN SPIRITED AS I FALL ASLEEP WHEN I HAVE PACED THREE THOUSAND TIMES ROUND MY CELL
38-121024-0030 NO SOONER HAD THIS IDEA TAKEN POSSESSION OF HIM THAN HE BECAME MORE COMPOSED ARRANGED HIS COUCH TO THE BEST OF HIS POWER ATE LITTLE AND SLEPT LESS
38-121024-0031 AND FOUND EXISTENCE ALMOST SUPPORTABLE BECAUSE HE FELT THAT HE COULD THROW IT OFF AT PLEASURE LIKE A WORN OUT GARMENT TWO METHODS OF SELF DESTRUCTION WERE AT HIS DISPOSAL HE COULD HANG HIMSELF WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO THE WINDOW BARS
38-121024-0032 OR REFUSE FOOD AND DIE OF STARVATION BUT THE FIRST WAS REPUGNANT TO HIM
38-121024-0033 WHO ARE HUNG UP TO THE YARD ARM HE WOULD NOT DIE BY WHAT SEEMED AN INFAMOUS DEATH HE RESOLVED TO ADOPT THE SECOND AND BEGAN THAT DAY TO CARRY OUT HIS RESOLVE NEARLY FOUR YEARS HAD PASSED AWAY
38-121024-0034 AT THE END OF THE SECOND HE HAD CEASED TO MARK THE LAPSE OF TIME DANTES SAID I WISH TO DIE AND HAD CHOSEN THE MANNER OF HIS DEATH AND FEARFUL OF CHANGING HIS MIND HE HAD TAKEN AN OATH TO DIE
38-121024-0035 WHEN MY MORNING AND EVENING MEALS ARE BROUGHT THOUGHT HE I WILL CAST THEM OUT OF THE WINDOW AND THEY WILL THINK THAT I HAVE EATEN THEM HE KEPT HIS WORD TWICE A DAY HE CAST OUT THROUGH THE BARRED APERTURE THE PROVISIONS HIS JAILER BROUGHT HIM
38-121024-0036 AT FIRST GAYLY THEN WITH DELIBERATION AND AT LAST WITH REGRET NOTHING BUT THE RECOLLECTION OF HIS OATH GAVE HIM STRENGTH TO PROCEED
38-121024-0037 HE HELD THE PLATE IN HIS HAND FOR AN HOUR AT A TIME AND GAZED THOUGHTFULLY AT THE MORSEL OF BAD MEAT OF TAINTED FISH OF BLACK AND MOULDY BREAD IT WAS THE LAST YEARNING FOR LIFE CONTENDING WITH THE RESOLUTION OF DESPAIR
38-121024-0038 HIS PROSPECTS LESS DESPERATE HE WAS STILL YOUNG HE WAS ONLY FOUR OR FIVE AND TWENTY HE HAD NEARLY FIFTY YEARS TO LIVE WHAT UNFORSEEN EVENTS MIGHT NOT OPEN HIS PRISON DOOR AND RESTORE HIM TO LIBERTY
38-121024-0039 THEN HE RAISED TO HIS LIPS THE REPAST THAT LIKE A VOLUNTARY TANTALUS HE REFUSED HIMSELF BUT HE THOUGHT OF HIS OATH AND HE WOULD NOT BREAK IT HE PERSISTED UNTIL AT LAST
38-121024-0040 HE HAD NOT SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO RISE AND CAST HIS SUPPER OUT OF THE LOOPHOLE THE NEXT MORNING HE COULD NOT SEE OR HEAR THE JAILER FEARED HE WAS DANGEROUSLY ILL EDMOND HOPED HE WAS DYING THUS THE DAY PASSED AWAY
38-121024-0041 EDMOND HEARD A HOLLOW SOUND IN THE WALL AGAINST WHICH HE WAS LYING SO MANY LOATHSOME ANIMALS INHABITED THE PRISON THAT THEIR NOISE DID NOT IN GENERAL AWAKE HIM BUT WHETHER ABSTINENCE HAD QUICKENED HIS FACULTIES
38-121024-0042 OR WHETHER THE NOISE WAS REALLY LOUDER THAN USUAL EDMOND RAISED HIS HEAD AND LISTENED IT WAS A CONTINUAL SCRATCHING AS IF MADE BY A HUGE CLAW A POWERFUL TOOTH OR SOME IRON INSTRUMENT ATTACKING THE STONES
38-121024-0043 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HEAVEN HAD AT LENGTH TAKEN PITY ON HIM AND HAD SENT THIS NOISE TO WARN HIM ON THE VERY BRINK OF THE ABYSS PERHAPS ONE OF THOSE BELOVED ONES HE HAD SO OFTEN THOUGHT OF WAS THINKING OF HIM
38-121024-0044 AND STRIVING TO DIMINISH THE DISTANCE THAT SEPARATED THEM NO NO DOUBTLESS HE WAS DECEIVED AND IT WAS BUT ONE OF THOSE DREAMS THAT FORERUN DEATH
38-121024-0045 SOME HOURS AFTERWARDS IT BEGAN AGAIN NEARER AND MORE DISTINCT EDMOND WAS INTENSELY INTERESTED SUDDENLY THE JAILER ENTERED
38-121024-0046 AND DURING THE FOUR DAYS THAT HE HAD BEEN CARRYING OUT HIS PURPOSE EDMOND HAD NOT SPOKEN TO THE ATTENDANT HAD NOT ANSWERED HIM WHEN HE INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM AND TURNED HIS FACE TO THE WALL WHEN HE LOOKED TOO CURIOUSLY AT HIM
38-121024-0047 BUT NOW THE JAILER MIGHT HEAR THE NOISE AND PUT AN END TO IT AND SO DESTROY A RAY OF SOMETHING LIKE HOPE THAT SOOTHED HIS LAST MOMENTS THE JAILER BROUGHT HIM HIS BREAKFAST
38-121024-0048 DANTES RAISED HIMSELF UP AND BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING ABOUT THE BAD QUALITY OF THE FOOD ABOUT THE COLDNESS OF HIS DUNGEON GRUMBLING AND COMPLAINING IN ORDER TO HAVE AN EXCUSE FOR SPEAKING LOUDER
38-121024-0049 AND WEARYING THE PATIENCE OF HIS JAILER WHO OUT OF KINDNESS OF HEART HAD BROUGHT BROTH AND WHITE BREAD FOR HIS PRISONER FORTUNATELY HE FANCIED THAT DANTES WAS DELIRIOUS AND PLACING THE FOOD ON THE RICKETY TABLE HE WITHDREW
38-121024-0050 SUDDENLY ANOTHER IDEA TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS MIND SO USED TO MISFORTUNE THAT IT WAS SCARCELY CAPABLE OF HOPE THE IDEA THAT THE NOISE WAS MADE BY WORKMEN THE GOVERNOR HAD ORDERED TO REPAIR THE NEIGHBORING DUNGEON
38-121024-0051 IT WAS EASY TO ASCERTAIN THIS BUT HOW COULD HE RISK THE QUESTION IT WAS EASY TO CALL HIS JAILER'S ATTENTION TO THE NOISE AND WATCH HIS COUNTENANCE AS HE LISTENED
38-121024-0052 HE TURNED HIS EYES TOWARDS THE SOUP WHICH THE JAILER HAD BROUGHT ROSE STAGGERED TOWARDS IT RAISED THE VESSEL TO HIS LIPS AND DRANK OFF THE CONTENTS WITH A FEELING OF INDESCRIBABLE PLEASURE
38-121024-0053 HE HAD OFTEN HEARD THAT SHIPWRECKED PERSONS HAD DIED THROUGH HAVING EAGERLY DEVOURED TOO MUCH FOOD EDMOND REPLACED ON THE TABLE THE BREAD HE WAS ABOUT TO DEVOUR AND RETURNED TO HIS COUCH HE DID NOT WISH TO DIE
38-121024-0054 HE SOON FELT THAT HIS IDEAS BECAME AGAIN COLLECTED HE COULD THINK AND STRENGTHEN HIS THOUGHTS BY REASONING THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF I MUST PUT THIS TO THE TEST BUT WITHOUT COMPROMISING ANYBODY
38-121024-0055 IF IT IS A WORKMAN I NEED BUT KNOCK AGAINST THE WALL AND HE WILL CEASE TO WORK IN ORDER TO FIND OUT WHO IS KNOCKING AND WHY HE DOES SO BUT AS HIS OCCUPATION IS SANCTIONED BY THE GOVERNOR HE WILL SOON RESUME IT
38-121024-0056 IF ON THE CONTRARY IT IS A PRISONER THE NOISE I MAKE WILL ALARM HIM HE WILL CEASE AND NOT BEGIN AGAIN UNTIL HE THINKS EVERY ONE IS ASLEEP EDMOND ROSE AGAIN BUT THIS TIME HIS LEGS DID NOT TREMBLE AND HIS SIGHT WAS CLEAR
38-121024-0057 HE WENT TO A CORNER OF HIS DUNGEON DETACHED A STONE AND WITH IT KNOCKED AGAINST THE WALL WHERE THE SOUND CAME HE STRUCK THRICE AT THE FIRST BLOW THE SOUND CEASED AS IF BY MAGIC EDMOND LISTENED INTENTLY AN HOUR PASSED
38-121024-0058 TWO HOURS PASSED AND NO SOUND WAS HEARD FROM THE WALL ALL WAS SILENT THERE FULL OF HOPE EDMOND SWALLOWED A FEW MOUTHFULS OF BREAD AND WATER AND THANKS TO THE VIGOR OF HIS CONSTITUTION FOUND HIMSELF WELL NIGH RECOVERED
38-121024-0059 THE DAY PASSED AWAY IN UTTER SILENCE NIGHT CAME WITHOUT RECURRENCE OF THE NOISE IT IS A PRISONER SAID EDMOND JOYFULLY THE NIGHT PASSED IN PERFECT SILENCE EDMOND DID NOT CLOSE HIS EYES
38-121024-0060 IN THE MORNING THE JAILER BROUGHT HIM FRESH PROVISIONS HE HAD ALREADY DEVOURED THOSE OF THE PREVIOUS DAY HE ATE THESE LISTENING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE SOUND WALKING ROUND AND ROUND HIS CELL
38-121024-0061 RESTORING VIGOR AND AGILITY TO HIS LIMBS BY EXERCISE AND SO PREPARING HIMSELF FOR HIS FUTURE DESTINY AT INTERVALS HE LISTENED TO LEARN IF THE NOISE HAD NOT BEGUN AGAIN AND GREW IMPATIENT AT THE PRUDENCE OF THE PRISONER
38-121024-0062 WHO DID NOT GUESS HE HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY A CAPTIVE AS ANXIOUS FOR LIBERTY AS HIMSELF THREE DAYS PASSED SEVENTY TWO LONG TEDIOUS HOURS WHICH HE COUNTED OFF BY MINUTES AT LENGTH ONE EVENING
38-121024-0063 AS THE JAILER WAS VISITING HIM FOR THE LAST TIME THAT NIGHT
38-121024-0064 HE MOVED AWAY WALKED UP AND DOWN HIS CELL TO COLLECT HIS THOUGHTS AND THEN WENT BACK AND LISTENED THE MATTER WAS NO LONGER DOUBTFUL SOMETHING WAS AT WORK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL
38-121024-0065 THE PRISONER HAD DISCOVERED THE DANGER AND HAD SUBSTITUTED A LEVER FOR A CHISEL ENCOURAGED BY THIS DISCOVERY EDMOND DETERMINED TO ASSIST THE INDEFATIGABLE LABORER
38-121024-0066 THE WINDOW GRATING WAS OF IRON BUT HE HAD TOO OFTEN ASSURED HIMSELF OF ITS SOLIDITY ALL HIS FURNITURE CONSISTED OF A BED A CHAIR A TABLE A PAIL AND A JUG THE BED HAD IRON CLAMPS BUT THEY WERE SCREWED TO THE WOOD
38-121024-0067 AND IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A SCREW DRIVER TO TAKE THEM OFF THE TABLE AND CHAIR HAD NOTHING THE PAIL HAD ONCE POSSESSED A HANDLE BUT THAT HAD BEEN REMOVED
38-121024-0068 HE LET THE JUG FALL ON THE FLOOR AND IT BROKE IN PIECES DANTES CONCEALED TWO OR THREE OF THE SHARPEST FRAGMENTS IN HIS BED LEAVING THE REST ON THE FLOOR THE BREAKING OF HIS JUG WAS TOO NATURAL AN ACCIDENT TO EXCITE SUSPICION EDMOND HAD ALL THE NIGHT TO WORK IN
38-121024-0069 BUT IN THE DARKNESS HE COULD NOT DO MUCH AND HE SOON FELT THAT HE WAS WORKING AGAINST SOMETHING VERY HARD HE PUSHED BACK HIS BED AND WAITED FOR DAY ALL NIGHT HE HEARD THE SUBTERRANEAN WORKMAN WHO CONTINUED TO MINE HIS WAY DAY CAME THE JAILER ENTERED
38-121024-0070 DANTES TOLD HIM THAT THE JUG HAD FALLEN FROM HIS HANDS WHILE HE WAS DRINKING AND THE JAILER WENT GRUMBLINGLY TO FETCH ANOTHER WITHOUT GIVING HIMSELF THE TROUBLE TO REMOVE THE FRAGMENTS OF THE BROKEN ONE HE RETURNED SPEEDILY ADVISED THE PRISONER TO BE MORE CAREFUL AND DEPARTED
38-121024-0071 DANTES HEARD JOYFULLY THE KEY GRATE IN THE LOCK HE LISTENED UNTIL THE SOUND OF STEPS DIED AWAY AND THEN HASTILY DISPLACING HIS BED SAW BY THE FAINT LIGHT THAT PENETRATED INTO HIS CELL
38-121024-0072 BUT AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR HE HAD SCRAPED OFF A HANDFUL A MATHEMATICIAN MIGHT HAVE CALCULATED THAT IN TWO YEARS SUPPOSING THAT THE ROCK WAS NOT ENCOUNTERED A PASSAGE TWENTY FEET LONG AND TWO FEET BROAD MIGHT BE FORMED
38-121024-0073 THE PRISONER REPROACHED HIMSELF WITH NOT HAVING THUS EMPLOYED THE HOURS HE HAD PASSED IN VAIN HOPES PRAYER AND DESPONDENCY DURING THE SIX YEARS THAT HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED WHAT MIGHT HE NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED
38-121024-0074 IN THREE DAYS HE HAD SUCCEEDED WITH THE UTMOST PRECAUTION IN REMOVING THE CEMENT AND EXPOSING THE STONE WORK THE WALL WAS BUILT OF ROUGH STONES AMONG WHICH TO GIVE STRENGTH TO THE STRUCTURE BLOCKS OF HEWN STONE WERE AT INTERVALS IMBEDDED
38-121024-0075 IT WAS ONE OF THESE HE HAD UNCOVERED AND WHICH HE MUST REMOVE FROM ITS SOCKET DANTES STROVE TO DO THIS WITH HIS NAILS BUT THEY WERE TOO WEAK THE FRAGMENTS OF THE JUG BROKE AND AFTER AN HOUR OF USELESS TOIL HE PAUSED
38-121024-0076 WAS HE TO BE THUS STOPPED AT THE BEGINNING AND WAS HE TO WAIT INACTIVE UNTIL HIS FELLOW WORKMAN HAD COMPLETED HIS TASK SUDDENLY AN IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM HE SMILED AND THE PERSPIRATION DRIED ON HIS FOREHEAD
38-121024-0077 THE JAILER ALWAYS BROUGHT DANTES SOUP IN AN IRON SAUCEPAN THIS SAUCEPAN CONTAINED SOUP FOR BOTH PRISONERS
38-121024-0078 NOW WHEN EVENING CAME DANTES PUT HIS PLATE ON THE GROUND NEAR THE DOOR THE JAILER AS HE ENTERED STEPPED ON IT AND BROKE IT
38-121024-0079 HE WAS WRONG TO LEAVE IT THERE BUT THE JAILER WAS WRONG NOT TO HAVE LOOKED BEFORE HIM THE JAILER THEREFORE ONLY GRUMBLED THEN HE LOOKED ABOUT FOR SOMETHING TO POUR THE SOUP INTO DANTES ENTIRE DINNER SERVICE CONSISTED OF ONE PLATE THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE
38-121024-0080 YOU CAN TAKE IT AWAY WHEN YOU BRING ME MY BREAKFAST THIS ADVICE WAS TO THE JAILER'S TASTE AS IT SPARED HIM THE NECESSITY OF MAKING ANOTHER TRIP HE LEFT THE SAUCEPAN
38-121024-0081 HE RAPIDLY DEVOURED HIS FOOD AND AFTER WAITING AN HOUR LEST THE JAILER SHOULD CHANGE HIS MIND AND RETURN HE REMOVED HIS BED TOOK THE HANDLE OF THE SAUCEPAN INSERTED THE POINT BETWEEN THE HEWN STONE AND ROUGH STONES OF THE WALL AND EMPLOYED IT AS A LEVER
38-121024-0082 AT THE END OF AN HOUR THE STONE WAS EXTRICATED FROM THE WALL LEAVING A CAVITY A FOOT AND A HALF IN DIAMETER
38-121024-0083 CARRIED IT INTO THE CORNER OF HIS CELL AND COVERED IT WITH EARTH THEN WISHING TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF HIS TIME WHILE HE HAD THE MEANS OF LABOR HE CONTINUED TO WORK WITHOUT CEASING AT THE DAWN OF DAY HE REPLACED THE STONE
38-121024-0084 PUSHED HIS BED AGAINST THE WALL AND LAY DOWN THE BREAKFAST CONSISTED OF A PIECE OF BREAD THE JAILER ENTERED AND PLACED THE BREAD ON THE TABLE WELL DON'T YOU INTEND TO BRING ME ANOTHER PLATE SAID DANTES NO REPLIED THE TURNKEY
38-121024-0085 YOU DESTROY EVERYTHING FIRST YOU BREAK YOUR JUG THEN YOU MAKE ME BREAK YOUR PLATE IF ALL THE PRISONERS FOLLOWED YOUR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE RUINED I SHALL LEAVE YOU THE SAUCEPAN AND POUR YOUR SOUP INTO THAT SO FOR THE FUTURE I HOPE YOU WILL NOT BE SO DESTRUCTIVE
38-121024-0086 HE FELT MORE GRATITUDE FOR THE POSSESSION OF THIS PIECE OF IRON THAN HE HAD EVER FELT FOR ANYTHING HE HAD NOTICED HOWEVER THAT THE PRISONER ON THE OTHER SIDE HAD CEASED TO LABOR NO MATTER THIS WAS A GREATER REASON FOR PROCEEDING
38-121024-0087 IF HIS NEIGHBOR WOULD NOT COME TO HIM HE WOULD GO TO HIS NEIGHBOR ALL DAY HE TOILED ON UNTIRINGLY AND BY THE EVENING HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN EXTRACTING TEN HANDFULS OF PLASTER AND FRAGMENTS OF STONE
38-121024-0088 WHEN THE HOUR FOR HIS JAILER'S VISIT ARRIVED DANTES STRAIGHTENED THE HANDLE OF THE SAUCEPAN AS WELL AS HE COULD AND PLACED IT IN ITS ACCUSTOMED PLACE THE TURNKEY POURED HIS RATION OF SOUP INTO IT TOGETHER WITH THE FISH
38-121024-0089 HE LISTENED ALL WAS SILENT AS IT HAD BEEN FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS DANTES SIGHED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HIS NEIGHBOR DISTRUSTED HIM HOWEVER HE TOILED ON ALL THE NIGHT WITHOUT BEING DISCOURAGED
38-121024-0090 IT WAS NECESSARY THEREFORE TO DIG ABOVE OR UNDER IT THE UNHAPPY YOUNG MAN HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THIS O MY GOD MY GOD MURMURED HE I HAVE SO EARNESTLY PRAYED TO YOU THAT I HOPED MY PRAYERS HAD BEEN HEARD
38-121024-0091 AFTER HAVING DEPRIVED ME OF MY LIBERTY AFTER HAVING DEPRIVED ME OF DEATH AFTER HAVING RECALLED ME TO EXISTENCE MY GOD HAVE PITY ON ME AND DO NOT LET ME DIE IN DESPAIR
38-121024-0092 WHO TALKS OF GOD AND DESPAIR AT THE SAME TIME SAID A VOICE THAT SEEMED TO COME FROM BENEATH THE EARTH
38-121024-0093 EDMOND'S HAIR STOOD ON END AND HE ROSE TO HIS KNEES AH SAID HE I HEAR A HUMAN VOICE EDMOND HAD NOT HEARD ANY ONE SPEAK SAVE HIS JAILER FOR FOUR OR FIVE YEARS
38-121024-0094 AND A JAILER IS NO MAN TO A PRISONER HE IS A LIVING DOOR A BARRIER OF FLESH AND BLOOD ADDING STRENGTH TO RESTRAINTS OF OAK AND IRON
38-121024-0095 A FRENCHMAN YOUR NAME
38-121024-0096 A SAILOR HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE SINCE THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN YOUR CRIME I AM INNOCENT

38-121024-0098 FOR THE EMPEROR'S RETURN THE EMPEROR IS NO LONGER ON THE THRONE THEN HE ABDICATED AT FONTAINEBLEAU IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN AND WAS SENT TO THE ISLAND OF ELBA BUT HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE THAT YOU ARE IGNORANT OF ALL THIS
38-121024-0099 SINCE EIGHTEEN ELEVEN DANTES SHUDDERED THIS MAN HAD BEEN FOUR YEARS LONGER THAN HIMSELF IN PRISON DO NOT DIG ANY MORE SAID THE VOICE ONLY TELL ME HOW HIGH UP IS YOUR EXCAVATION
38-121024-0100 ON A LEVEL WITH THE FLOOR HOW IS IT CONCEALED BEHIND MY BED HAS YOUR BED BEEN MOVED SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN A PRISONER NO WHAT DOES YOUR CHAMBER OPEN ON A CORRIDOR AND THE CORRIDOR ON A COURT
38-121024-0101 ALAS MURMURED THE VOICE OH WHAT IS THE MATTER CRIED DANTES I HAVE MADE A MISTAKE OWING TO AN ERROR IN MY PLANS I TOOK THE WRONG ANGLE AND HAVE COME OUT FIFTEEN FEET FROM WHERE I INTENDED
38-121024-0102 I TOOK THE WALL YOU ARE MINING FOR THE OUTER WALL OF THE FORTRESS BUT THEN YOU WOULD BE CLOSE TO THE SEA THAT IS WHAT I HOPED AND SUPPOSING YOU HAD SUCCEEDED I SHOULD HAVE THROWN MYSELF INTO THE SEA
38-121024-0103 HEAVEN WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME STRENGTH BUT NOW ALL IS LOST ALL YES STOP UP YOUR EXCAVATION CAREFULLY DO NOT WORK ANY MORE AND WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR FROM ME TELL ME AT LEAST WHO YOU ARE I AM
38-121024-0104 EDMOND FANCIED HE HEARD A BITTER LAUGH RESOUNDING FROM THE DEPTHS
38-121024-0105 I SWEAR TO YOU BY HIM WHO DIED FOR US THAT NAUGHT SHALL INDUCE ME TO BREATHE ONE SYLLABLE TO MY JAILERS BUT I CONJURE YOU DO NOT ABANDON ME IF YOU DO I SWEAR TO YOU FOR I HAVE GOT TO THE END OF MY STRENGTH
38-121024-0106 HOW OLD ARE YOU YOUR VOICE IS THAT OF A YOUNG MAN

38-121024-0111 IT IS WELL RETURNED THE VOICE TO MORROW
38-121024-0112 AND CAPTIVITY THAT IS SHARED IS BUT HALF CAPTIVITY PLAINTS MADE IN COMMON ARE ALMOST PRAYERS AND PRAYERS WHERE TWO OR THREE ARE GATHERED TOGETHER INVOKE THE MERCY OF HEAVEN
38-121024-0113 WHEN THE JAILER MOVED HIS BED AND STOOPED TO EXAMINE THE OPENING HE WOULD KILL HIM WITH HIS WATER JUG HE WOULD BE CONDEMNED TO DIE BUT HE WAS ABOUT TO DIE OF GRIEF AND DESPAIR WHEN THIS MIRACULOUS NOISE RECALLED HIM TO LIFE THE JAILER CAME IN THE EVENING
38-121024-0114 DANTES WAS ON HIS BED IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THUS HE BETTER GUARDED THE UNFINISHED OPENING DOUBTLESS THERE WAS A STRANGE EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES FOR THE JAILER SAID COME ARE YOU GOING MAD AGAIN DANTES DID NOT ANSWER
38-121024-0115 HE FEARED THAT THE EMOTION OF HIS VOICE WOULD BETRAY HIM THE JAILER WENT AWAY SHAKING HIS HEAD NIGHT CAME DANTES HOPED THAT HIS NEIGHBOR WOULD PROFIT BY THE SILENCE TO ADDRESS HIM BUT HE WAS MISTAKEN THE NEXT MORNING HOWEVER
38-121024-0116 JUST AS HE REMOVED HIS BED FROM THE WALL HE HEARD THREE KNOCKS HE THREW HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES IS IT YOU SAID HE I AM HERE IS YOUR JAILER GONE
38-121024-0117 YES SAID DANTES HE WILL NOT RETURN UNTIL THE EVENING SO THAT WE HAVE TWELVE HOURS BEFORE US I CAN WORK THEN SAID THE VOICE OH YES YES THIS INSTANT I ENTREAT YOU IN A MOMENT THAT PART OF THE FLOOR ON WHICH DANTES WAS RESTING HIS TWO HANDS
38-121024-0118 AS HE KNELT WITH HIS HEAD IN THE OPENING SUDDENLY GAVE WAY HE DREW BACK SMARTLY WHILE A MASS OF STONES AND EARTH DISAPPEARED IN A HOLE THAT OPENED BENEATH THE APERTURE HE HIMSELF HAD FORMED
