4863-24734-0000 A THING WHICH IS CONDITIONED TO ACT IN A PARTICULAR MANNER HAS NECESSARILY BEEN THUS CONDITIONED BY GOD AND THAT WHICH HAS NOT BEEN CONDITIONED BY GOD CANNOT CONDITION ITSELF TO ACT PROOF
4863-24734-0001 THAT BY WHICH THINGS ARE SAID TO BE CONDITIONED TO ACT IN A PARTICULAR MANNER IS NECESSARILY SOMETHING POSITIVE THIS IS OBVIOUS THEREFORE BOTH OF ITS ESSENCE AND OF ITS EXISTENCE GOD BY THE NECESSITY OF HIS NATURE IS THE EFFICIENT CAUSE
4863-24734-0002 THIS IS OUR FIRST POINT OUR SECOND POINT IS PLAINLY TO BE INFERRED THEREFROM FOR IF A THING WHICH HAS NOT BEEN CONDITIONED BY GOD COULD CONDITION ITSELF THE FIRST PART OF OUR PROOF WOULD BE FALSE AND THIS AS WE HAVE SHOWN IS ABSURD
4863-24734-0003 BUT FROM GOD OR FROM ANY OF HIS ATTRIBUTES IN SO FAR AS THE LATTER IS MODIFIED
4863-24734-0004 THIS IS OUR FIRST POINT AGAIN THIS CAUSE OR THIS MODIFICATION FOR THE REASON BY WHICH WE ESTABLISHED THE FIRST PART OF THIS PROOF MUST IN ITS TURN BE CONDITIONED BY ANOTHER CAUSE WHICH ALSO IS FINITE AND HAS A CONDITIONED EXISTENCE AND AGAIN
4863-24734-0005 THIS LAST BY ANOTHER FOR THE SAME REASON AND SO ON FOR THE SAME REASON TO INFINITY
4863-24734-0006 NOTE AS CERTAIN THINGS MUST BE PRODUCED IMMEDIATELY BY GOD NAMELY THOSE THINGS WHICH NECESSARILY FOLLOW FROM HIS ABSOLUTE NATURE THROUGH THE MEANS OF THESE PRIMARY ATTRIBUTES WHICH NEVERTHELESS CAN NEITHER EXIST NOR BE CONCEIVED WITHOUT GOD IT FOLLOWS
4863-24734-0007 THAT GOD IS ABSOLUTELY THE PROXIMATE CAUSE OF THOSE THINGS IMMEDIATELY PRODUCED BY HIM I SAY ABSOLUTELY NOT AFTER HIS KIND
4863-24734-0008 IF THEY BE CONDITIONED BY GOD IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AND NOT CONTINGENT THAT THEY SHOULD RENDER THEMSELVES UNCONDITIONED WHEREFORE ALL THINGS ARE CONDITIONED BY THE NECESSITY OF THE DIVINE NATURE NOT ONLY TO EXIST
4863-24734-0009 BUT ALSO TO EXIST AND OPERATE IN A PARTICULAR MANNER AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS CONTINGENT
4863-24734-0010 NOTE BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER I WISH HERE TO EXPLAIN WHAT WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND BY NATURE VIEWED AS ACTIVE NATURA NATURANS AND NATURE VIEWED AS PASSIVE NATURA NATURATA I SAY TO EXPLAIN OR RATHER CALL ATTENTION TO IT
4863-24734-0011 FOR I THINK THAT FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IT IS SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR THAT BY NATURE VIEWED AS ACTIVE WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT WHICH IS IN ITSELF AND IS CONCEIVED THROUGH ITSELF OR THOSE ATTRIBUTES OF SUBSTANCE WHICH EXPRESS ETERNAL AND INFINITE ESSENCE
4863-24734-0012 BY NATURE VIEWED AS PASSIVE I UNDERSTAND ALL THAT WHICH FOLLOWS FROM THE NECESSITY OF THE NATURE OF GOD OR OF ANY OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD THAT IS ALL THE MODES OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE CONSIDERED AS THINGS WHICH ARE IN GOD
4863-24734-0013 AND WHICH WITHOUT GOD CANNOT EXIST OR BE CONCEIVED
4863-24734-0014 ACTU FINITE OR IN FUNCTION INFINITE MUST COMPREHEND THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD AND THE MODIFICATIONS OF GOD AND NOTHING ELSE PROOF
4863-24734-0015 IN OTHER WORDS OBVIOUSLY THAT WHICH IS CONTAINED IN THE INTELLECT IN REPRESENTATION MUST NECESSARILY BE GRANTED IN NATURE
