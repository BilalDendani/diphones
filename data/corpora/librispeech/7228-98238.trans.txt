7228-98238-0000 FROM LITTLE BRITAIN I WENT WITH MY CHECK IN MY POCKET TO MISS SKIFFINS'S BROTHER THE ACCOUNTANT AND MISS SKIFFINS'S BROTHER THE ACCOUNTANT GOING STRAIGHT TO CLARRIKER'S AND BRINGING CLARRIKER TO ME
7228-98238-0001 I HAD THE GREAT SATISFACTION OF CONCLUDING THAT ARRANGEMENT IT WAS THE ONLY GOOD THING I HAD DONE AND THE ONLY COMPLETED THING I HAD DONE
7228-98238-0002 SINCE I WAS FIRST APPRISED OF MY GREAT EXPECTATIONS CLARRIKER INFORMING ME ON THAT OCCASION THAT THE AFFAIRS OF THE HOUSE WERE STEADILY PROGRESSING THAT HE WOULD NOW BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A SMALL BRANCH HOUSE IN THE EAST
7228-98238-0003 WHICH WAS MUCH WANTED FOR THE EXTENSION OF THE BUSINESS AND THAT HERBERT IN HIS NEW PARTNERSHIP CAPACITY WOULD GO OUT AND TAKE CHARGE OF IT I FOUND THAT I MUST HAVE PREPARED FOR A SEPARATION FROM MY FRIEND EVEN THOUGH MY OWN AFFAIRS HAD BEEN MORE SETTLED
7228-98238-0004 AND NOW INDEED I FELT AS IF MY LAST ANCHOR WERE LOOSENING ITS HOLD AND I SHOULD SOON BE DRIVING WITH THE WINDS AND WAVES BUT THERE WAS RECOMPENSE IN THE JOY WITH WHICH HERBERT WOULD COME HOME OF A NIGHT AND TELL ME OF THESE CHANGES
7228-98238-0005 LITTLE IMAGINING THAT HE TOLD ME NO NEWS AND WOULD SKETCH AIRY PICTURES OF HIMSELF CONDUCTING CLARA BARLEY TO THE LAND OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS AND OF ME GOING OUT TO JOIN THEM WITH A CARAVAN OF CAMELS I BELIEVE
7228-98238-0006 AND OF OUR ALL GOING UP THE NILE AND SEEING WONDERS WITHOUT BEING SANGUINE AS TO MY OWN PART IN THOSE BRIGHT PLANS I FELT THAT HERBERT'S WAY WAS CLEARING FAST AND THAT OLD BILL BARLEY HAD BUT TO STICK TO HIS PEPPER AND RUM
7228-98238-0007 AND HIS DAUGHTER WOULD SOON BE HAPPILY PROVIDED FOR WE HAD NOW GOT INTO THE MONTH OF MARCH MY LEFT ARM THOUGH IT PRESENTED NO BAD SYMPTOMS TOOK IN THE NATURAL COURSE SO LONG TO HEAL
7228-98238-0008 MY RIGHT ARM WAS TOLERABLY RESTORED DISFIGURED BUT FAIRLY SERVICEABLE ON A MONDAY MORNING WHEN HERBERT AND I WERE AT BREAKFAST I RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM WEMMICK BY THE POST WALWORTH
7228-98238-0009 BURN THIS AS SOON AS READ EARLY IN THE WEEK OR SAY WEDNESDAY YOU MIGHT DO WHAT YOU KNOW OF IF YOU FELT DISPOSED TO TRY IT NOW BURN WHEN I HAD SHOWN THIS TO HERBERT AND HAD PUT IT IN THE FIRE
7228-98238-0010 BUT NOT BEFORE WE HAD BOTH GOT IT BY HEART WE CONSIDERED WHAT TO DO FOR OF COURSE MY BEING DISABLED COULD NOW BE NO LONGER KEPT OUT OF VIEW
7228-98238-0011 TAKE STARTOP A GOOD FELLOW A SKILLED HAND FOND OF US AND ENTHUSIASTIC AND HONORABLE I HAD THOUGHT OF HIM MORE THAN ONCE BUT HOW MUCH WOULD YOU TELL HIM HERBERT IT IS NECESSARY TO TELL HIM VERY LITTLE
7228-98238-0012 LET HIM SUPPOSE IT A MERE FREAK BUT A SECRET ONE UNTIL THE MORNING COMES THEN LET HIM KNOW THAT THERE IS URGENT REASON FOR YOUR GETTING PROVIS ABOARD AND AWAY YOU GO WITH HIM NO DOUBT WHERE
7228-98238-0013 IT HAD SEEMED TO ME IN THE MANY ANXIOUS CONSIDERATIONS I HAD GIVEN THE POINT ALMOST INDIFFERENT WHAT PORT WE MADE FOR HAMBURG ROTTERDAM ANTWERP THE PLACE SIGNIFIED LITTLE SO THAT HE WAS OUT OF ENGLAND
7228-98238-0014 AND WOULD TAKE US UP WOULD DO I HAD ALWAYS PROPOSED TO MYSELF TO GET HIM WELL DOWN THE RIVER IN THE BOAT CERTAINLY WELL BEYOND GRAVESEND WHICH WAS A CRITICAL PLACE FOR SEARCH OR INQUIRY IF SUSPICION WERE AFOOT
7228-98238-0015 AS FOREIGN STEAMERS WOULD LEAVE LONDON AT ABOUT THE TIME OF HIGH WATER
7228-98238-0016 BY A PREVIOUS EBB TIDE AND LIE BY IN SOME QUIET SPOT UNTIL WE COULD PULL OFF TO ONE
7228-98238-0017 IF WE MADE INQUIRIES BEFOREHAND HERBERT ASSENTED TO ALL THIS
7228-98238-0018 WE FOUND THAT A STEAMER FOR HAMBURG
7228-98238-0019 BUT WE NOTED DOWN WHAT OTHER FOREIGN STEAMERS WOULD LEAVE LONDON WITH THE SAME TIDE AND WE SATISFIED OURSELVES THAT WE KNEW THE BUILD AND COLOR OF EACH WE THEN SEPARATED FOR A FEW HOURS I TO GET AT ONCE SUCH PASSPORTS AS WERE NECESSARY
7228-98238-0020 HERBERT TO SEE STARTOP AT HIS LODGINGS WE BOTH DID WHAT WE HAD TO DO WITHOUT ANY HINDRANCE AND WHEN WE MET AGAIN AT ONE O'CLOCK REPORTED IT DONE I FOR MY PART WAS PREPARED WITH PASSPORTS HERBERT HAD SEEN STARTOP
7228-98238-0021 AND HE WAS MORE THAN READY TO JOIN THOSE TWO SHOULD PULL A PAIR OF OARS WE SETTLED AND I WOULD STEER OUR CHARGE WOULD BE SITTER AND KEEP QUIET AS SPEED WAS NOT OUR OBJECT WE SHOULD MAKE WAY ENOUGH
7228-98238-0022 THAT HE SHOULD NOT GO THERE AT ALL TO MORROW EVENING TUESDAY THAT HE SHOULD PREPARE PROVIS TO COME DOWN TO SOME STAIRS
7228-98238-0023 AND NOT SOONER THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS WITH HIM SHOULD BE CONCLUDED THAT MONDAY NIGHT AND THAT HE SHOULD BE COMMUNICATED WITH NO MORE IN ANY WAY UNTIL WE TOOK HIM ON BOARD THESE PRECAUTIONS WELL UNDERSTOOD BY BOTH OF US I WENT HOME
7228-98238-0024 ON OPENING THE OUTER DOOR OF OUR CHAMBERS WITH MY KEY I FOUND A LETTER IN THE BOX DIRECTED TO ME A VERY DIRTY LETTER THOUGH NOT ILL WRITTEN IT HAD BEEN DELIVERED BY HAND OF COURSE SINCE I LEFT HOME AND ITS CONTENTS WERE THESE
7228-98238-0025 AND TO COME TO THE LITTLE SLUICE HOUSE BY THE LIMEKILN YOU HAD BETTER COME IF YOU WANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR UNCLE PROVIS YOU HAD MUCH BETTER COME AND TELL NO ONE AND LOSE NO TIME YOU MUST COME ALONE BRING THIS WITH YOU
7228-98238-0026 WHAT TO DO NOW I COULD NOT TELL AND THE WORST WAS THAT I MUST DECIDE QUICKLY OR I SHOULD MISS THE AFTERNOON COACH WHICH WOULD TAKE ME DOWN IN TIME FOR TO NIGHT TO MORROW NIGHT I COULD NOT THINK OF GOING FOR IT WOULD BE TOO CLOSE
7228-98238-0027 UPON THE TIME OF THE FLIGHT AND AGAIN FOR ANYTHING I KNEW THE PROFFERED INFORMATION MIGHT HAVE SOME IMPORTANT BEARING ON THE FLIGHT ITSELF
7228-98238-0028 HAVING HARDLY ANY TIME FOR CONSIDERATION MY WATCH SHOWING ME THAT THE COACH STARTED WITHIN HALF AN HOUR I RESOLVED TO GO I SHOULD CERTAINLY NOT HAVE GONE BUT FOR THE REFERENCE TO MY UNCLE PROVIS THAT COMING ON WEMMICK'S LETTER
7228-98238-0029 AND THE MORNING'S BUSY PREPARATION TURNED THE SCALE IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO BECOME CLEARLY POSSESSED OF THE CONTENTS OF ALMOST ANY LETTER IN A VIOLENT HURRY THAT I HAD TO READ THIS MYSTERIOUS EPISTLE AGAIN TWICE
7228-98238-0030 BEFORE ITS INJUNCTION TO ME TO BE SECRET GOT MECHANICALLY INTO MY MIND
7228-98238-0031 I LEFT A NOTE IN PENCIL FOR HERBERT
7228-98238-0032 TO ASCERTAIN FOR MYSELF HOW MISS HAVISHAM WAS FARING I HAD THEN BARELY TIME TO GET MY GREAT COAT LOCK UP THE CHAMBERS AND MAKE FOR THE COACH OFFICE BY THE SHORT BY WAYS IF I HAD TAKEN A HACKNEY CHARIOT AND GONE BY THE STREETS
7228-98238-0033 I SHOULD HAVE MISSED MY AIM GOING AS I DID I CAUGHT THE COACH JUST AS IT CAME OUT OF THE YARD I WAS THE ONLY INSIDE PASSENGER
7228-98238-0034 JOLTING AWAY KNEE DEEP IN STRAW WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF FOR I REALLY HAD NOT BEEN MYSELF SINCE THE RECEIPT OF THE LETTER IT HAD SO BEWILDERED ME ENSUING ON THE HURRY OF THE MORNING THE MORNING HURRY AND FLUTTER HAD BEEN GREAT
7228-98238-0035 FOR LONG AND ANXIOUSLY AS I HAD WAITED FOR WEMMICK HIS HINT HAD COME LIKE A SURPRISE AT LAST AND NOW I BEGAN TO WONDER AT MYSELF FOR BEING IN THE COACH AND TO DOUBT WHETHER I HAD SUFFICIENT REASON FOR BEING THERE
7228-98238-0036 AND TO CONSIDER WHETHER I SHOULD GET OUT PRESENTLY AND GO BACK AND TO ARGUE AGAINST EVER HEEDING AN ANONYMOUS COMMUNICATION AND IN SHORT TO PASS THROUGH ALL THOSE PHASES OF CONTRADICTION AND INDECISION TO WHICH I SUPPOSE
7228-98238-0037 VERY FEW HURRIED PEOPLE ARE STRANGERS STILL THE REFERENCE TO PROVIS BY NAME MASTERED EVERYTHING I REASONED AS I HAD REASONED ALREADY WITHOUT KNOWING IT IF THAT BE REASONING
7228-98238-0038 IN CASE ANY HARM SHOULD BEFALL HIM THROUGH MY NOT GOING HOW COULD I EVER FORGIVE MYSELF IT WAS DARK BEFORE WE GOT DOWN AND THE JOURNEY SEEMED LONG AND DREARY TO ME WHO COULD SEE LITTLE OF IT INSIDE AND WHO COULD NOT GO OUTSIDE IN MY DISABLED STATE
7228-98238-0039 AVOIDING THE BLUE BOAR I PUT UP AT AN INN OF MINOR REPUTATION DOWN THE TOWN AND ORDERED SOME DINNER WHILE IT WAS PREPARING I WENT TO SATIS HOUSE AND INQUIRED FOR MISS HAVISHAM SHE WAS STILL VERY ILL THOUGH CONSIDERED SOMETHING BETTER
7228-98238-0040 MY INN HAD ONCE BEEN A PART OF AN ANCIENT ECCLESIASTICAL HOUSE AND I DINED IN A LITTLE OCTAGONAL COMMON ROOM LIKE A FONT AS I WAS NOT ABLE TO CUT MY DINNER THE OLD LANDLORD WITH A SHINING BALD HEAD DID IT FOR ME
7228-98238-0041 THIS BRINGING US INTO CONVERSATION HE WAS SO GOOD AS TO ENTERTAIN ME WITH MY OWN STORY OF COURSE WITH THE POPULAR FEATURE THAT PUMBLECHOOK WAS MY EARLIEST BENEFACTOR AND THE FOUNDER OF MY FORTUNES DO YOU KNOW THE YOUNG MAN SAID I
7228-98238-0042 KNOW HIM REPEATED THE LANDLORD EVER SINCE HE WAS NO HEIGHT AT ALL DOES HE EVER COME BACK TO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AY HE COMES BACK SAID THE LANDLORD TO HIS GREAT FRIENDS NOW AND AGAIN AND GIVES THE COLD SHOULDER TO THE MAN THAT MADE HIM WHAT MAN IS THAT
7228-98238-0043 HIM THAT I SPEAK OF SAID THE LANDLORD MISTER PUMBLECHOOK IS HE UNGRATEFUL TO NO ONE ELSE NO DOUBT HE WOULD BE IF HE COULD RETURNED THE LANDLORD BUT HE CAN'T AND WHY BECAUSE PUMBLECHOOK DONE EVERYTHING FOR HIM DOES PUMBLECHOOK SAY SO
7228-98238-0044 SAY SO REPLIED THE LANDLORD HE HAN'T NO CALL TO SAY SO BUT DOES HE SAY SO IT WOULD TURN A MAN'S BLOOD TO WHITE WINE WINEGAR TO HEAR HIM TELL OF IT SIR SAID THE LANDLORD I THOUGHT YET JOE DEAR JOE YOU NEVER TELL OF IT
7228-98238-0045 NOR YOU SWEET TEMPERED BIDDY YOUR APPETITE'S BEEN TOUCHED LIKE BY YOUR ACCIDENT SAID THE LANDLORD GLANCING AT THE BANDAGED ARM UNDER MY COAT TRY A TENDERER BIT NO THANK YOU I REPLIED TURNING FROM THE TABLE TO BROOD OVER THE FIRE
7228-98238-0046 I CAN EAT NO MORE PLEASE TAKE IT AWAY
7228-98238-0047 AS THROUGH THE BRAZEN IMPOSTOR PUMBLECHOOK THE FALSER HE THE TRUER JOE THE MEANER HE THE NOBLER JOE MY HEART WAS DEEPLY AND MOST DESERVEDLY HUMBLED
7228-98238-0048 AS I MUSED OVER THE FIRE FOR AN HOUR OR MORE THE STRIKING OF THE CLOCK AROUSED ME BUT NOT FROM MY DEJECTION OR REMORSE AND I GOT UP AND HAD MY COAT FASTENED ROUND MY NECK AND WENT OUT I HAD PREVIOUSLY SOUGHT IN MY POCKETS FOR THE LETTER
7228-98238-0049 THAT I MIGHT REFER TO IT AGAIN BUT I COULD NOT FIND IT
