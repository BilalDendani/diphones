8459-292348-0000 THESE ARE PERSONAGES IN THE SECRET ROSE
8459-292348-0001 THE POEMS ARE NOT OUT OF THAT BOOK I HAVE USED THEM IN THIS BOOK MORE AS PRINCIPLES OF THE MIND THAN AS ACTUAL PERSONAGES IT IS PROBABLE THAT ONLY STUDENTS OF THE MAGICAL TRADITION WILL UNDERSTAND ME WHEN I SAY THAT
8459-292348-0002 MICHAEL ROBARTES IS FIRE REFLECTED IN WATER AND THAT HANRAHAN IS FIRE BLOWN BY THE WIND
8459-292348-0003 WHOSE NAME IS NOT MERELY THE IRISH FORM OF HUGH BUT THE IRISH FOR FIRE IS FIRE BURNING BY ITSELF TO PUT IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY HANRAHAN IS THE SIMPLICITY OF AN IMAGINATION TOO CHANGEABLE TO GATHER PERMANENT POSSESSIONS
8459-292348-0004 OR THE ADORATION OF THE SHEPHERDS AND MICHAEL ROBARTES IS THE PRIDE OF THE IMAGINATION BROODING UPON THE GREATNESS OF ITS POSSESSIONS OR THE ADORATION OF THE MAGI
8459-292348-0005 MONGAN THINKS OF HIS PAST GREATNESS
8459-292348-0006 THE ROSE HAS BEEN FOR MANY CENTURIES A SYMBOL OF SPIRITUAL LOVE AND SUPREME BEAUTY THE COUNT GOBLET D'ALVIELLA THINKS THAT IT WAS ONCE A SYMBOL OF THE SUN ITSELF A PRINCIPAL SYMBOL OF THE DIVINE NATURE
8459-292348-0007 IS THE WESTERN FLOWER OF LIFE I HAVE IMAGINED IT GROWING UPON THE TREE OF LIFE I ONCE STOOD BESIDE A MAN IN IRELAND WHEN HE SAW IT GROWING THERE IN A VISION THAT SEEMED TO HAVE RAPT HIM OUT OF HIS BODY HE SAW THE GARDEN OF EDEN WALLED ABOUT
8459-292348-0008 AND ON THE TOP OF A HIGH MOUNTAIN AS IN CERTAIN MEDIAEVAL DIAGRAMS AND AFTER PASSING THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE ON WHICH GREW FRUIT FULL OF TROUBLED FACES AND THROUGH WHOSE BRANCHES FLOWED HE WAS TOLD SAP THAT WAS HUMAN SOULS
8459-292348-0009 HE CAME TO A TALL DARK TREE WITH LITTLE BITTER FRUITS AND WAS SHOWN A KIND OF STAIR OR LADDER GOING UP THROUGH THE TREE AND TOLD TO GO UP AND NEAR THE TOP OF THE TREE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN LIKE THE GODDESS OF LIFE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TREE IN ASSYRIA
8459-292348-0010 MY DARK ROSALEEN AND IN MISTER AUBREY DE VERE'S THE LITTLE BLACK ROSE I DO NOT KNOW ANY EVIDENCE TO PROVE WHETHER THIS SYMBOL CAME TO IRELAND WITH MEDIAEVAL CHRISTIANITY OR WHETHER IT HAS COME DOWN FROM CELTIC TIMES
8459-292348-0011 I HAVE READ SOMEWHERE THAT A STONE ENGRAVED WITH A CELTIC GOD WHO HOLDS WHAT LOOKS LIKE A ROSE IN ONE HAND HAS BEEN FOUND SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND BUT I CANNOT FIND THE REFERENCE THOUGH I CERTAINLY MADE A NOTE OF IT IF THE ROSE WAS REALLY A SYMBOL OF IRELAND AMONG THE GAELIC POETS
8459-292348-0012 OR BANBA GODDESSES WHO GAVE THEIR NAMES TO IRELAND OR WITH SOME PRINCIPAL GOD OR GODDESS FOR SUCH SYMBOLS ARE NOT SUDDENLY ADOPTED OR INVENTED BUT COME OUT OF MYTHOLOGY I HAVE MADE THE SEVEN LIGHTS THE CONSTELLATION OF THE BEAR
8459-292348-0013 LAMENT FOR THE THEFT OF THE ROSE AND I HAVE MADE THE DRAGON THE CONSTELLATION DRACO THE GUARDIAN OF THE ROSE BECAUSE THESE CONSTELLATIONS MOVE ABOUT THE POLE OF THE HEAVENS THE ANCIENT TREE OF LIFE IN MANY COUNTRIES
8459-292348-0014 AND ARE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE TREE OF LIFE IN MYTHOLOGY IT IS THIS TREE OF LIFE THAT I HAVE PUT INTO THE SONG OF MONGAN UNDER ITS COMMON IRISH FORM OF A HAZEL AND BECAUSE IT HAD SOMETIMES THE STARS FOR FRUIT I HAVE HUNG UPON IT
