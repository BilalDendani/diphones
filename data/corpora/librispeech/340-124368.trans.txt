340-124368-0000 THE FACTS WITH WHICH I SHALL DEAL THIS EVENING ARE MAINLY OLD AND FAMILIAR NOR IS THERE ANYTHING NEW IN THE GENERAL USE I SHALL MAKE OF THEM IF THERE SHALL BE ANY NOVELTY
340-124368-0001 IT WILL BE IN THE MODE OF PRESENTING THE FACTS AND THE INFERENCES AND OBSERVATIONS FOLLOWING THAT PRESENTATION IN HIS SPEECH LAST AUTUMN AT COLUMBUS OHIO AS REPORTED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES SENATOR DOUGLAS SAID OUR FATHERS
340-124368-0002 WHEN THEY FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE UNDERSTOOD THIS QUESTION JUST AS WELL AND EVEN BETTER THAN WE DO NOW I FULLY INDORSE THIS AND I ADOPT IT AS A TEXT FOR THIS DISCOURSE
340-124368-0003 THE ANSWER MUST BE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES THAT CONSTITUTION CONSISTS OF THE ORIGINAL FRAMED IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND UNDER WHICH THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT FIRST WENT INTO OPERATION AND TWELVE SUBSEQUENTLY FRAMED AMENDMENTS
340-124368-0004 THE FIRST TEN OF WHICH WERE FRAMED IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE WHO WERE OUR FATHERS THAT FRAMED THE CONSTITUTION I SUPPOSE THE THIRTY NINE WHO SIGNED THE ORIGINAL INSTRUMENT MAY BE FAIRLY CALLED OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THAT PART OF THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT
340-124368-0005 IT IS ALMOST EXACTLY TRUE TO SAY THEY FRAMED IT AND IT IS ALTOGETHER TRUE TO SAY THEY FAIRLY REPRESENTED THE OPINION AND SENTIMENT OF THE WHOLE NATION AT THAT TIME THEIR NAMES BEING FAMILIAR TO NEARLY ALL AND ACCESSIBLE TO QUITE ALL
340-124368-0006 NEED NOT NOW BE REPEATED I TAKE THESE THIRTY NINE FOR THE PRESENT AS BEING OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE WHAT IS THE QUESTION WHICH ACCORDING TO THE TEXT THOSE FATHERS UNDERSTOOD JUST AS WELL
340-124368-0007 AND EVEN BETTER THAN WE DO NOW IT IS THIS DOES THE PROPER DIVISION OF LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANYTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION FORBID OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN OUR FEDERAL TERRITORIES
340-124368-0008 UPON THIS SENATOR DOUGLAS HOLDS THE AFFIRMATIVE AND REPUBLICANS THE NEGATIVE THIS AFFIRMATION AND DENIAL FORM AN ISSUE AND THIS ISSUE THIS QUESTION IS PRECISELY WHAT THE TEXT DECLARES OUR FATHERS UNDERSTOOD
340-124368-0009 BETTER THAN WE LET US NOW INQUIRE WHETHER THE THIRTY NINE OR ANY OF THEM
340-124368-0010 AND IF THEY DID HOW THEY ACTED UPON IT HOW THEY EXPRESSED THAT BETTER UNDERSTANDING IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR THREE YEARS BEFORE THE CONSTITUTION
340-124368-0011 THE CONGRESS OF THE CONFEDERATION HAD BEFORE THEM THE QUESTION OF PROHIBITING SLAVERY IN THAT TERRITORY AND FOUR OF THE THIRTY NINE WHO AFTERWARD FRAMED THE CONSTITUTION WERE IN THAT CONGRESS AND VOTED ON THAT QUESTION
340-124368-0012 PROPERLY FORBADE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN FEDERAL TERRITORY THE OTHER OF THE FOUR JAMES MC HENRY VOTED AGAINST THE PROHIBITION SHOWING THAT FOR SOME CAUSE HE THOUGHT IT IMPROPER TO VOTE FOR IT
340-124368-0013 BUT WHILE THE CONVENTION WAS IN SESSION FRAMING IT
340-124368-0014 THE SAME QUESTION OF PROHIBITING SLAVERY IN THE TERRITORY AGAIN CAME BEFORE THE CONGRESS OF THE CONFEDERATION AND TWO MORE OF THE THIRTY NINE WHO AFTERWARD SIGNED THE CONSTITUTION WERE IN THAT CONGRESS AND VOTED ON THE QUESTION
340-124368-0015 THEY WERE WILLIAM BLOUNT AND WILLIAM FEW AND THEY BOTH VOTED FOR THE PROHIBITION THUS SHOWING THAT IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING NO LINE DIVIDING LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY NOR ANYTHING ELSE
340-124368-0016 PROPERLY FORBADE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN FEDERAL TERRITORY THIS TIME THE PROHIBITION BECAME A LAW BEING PART OF WHAT IS NOW WELL KNOWN AS THE ORDINANCE OF EIGHTY SEVEN THE QUESTION OF FEDERAL CONTROL OF SLAVERY IN THE TERRITORIES
340-124368-0017 SEEMS NOT TO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY BEFORE THE CONVENTION WHICH FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION AND HENCE IT IS NOT RECORDED THAT THE THIRTY NINE OR ANY OF THEM WHILE ENGAGED ON THAT INSTRUMENT EXPRESSED ANY OPINION ON THAT PRECISE QUESTION
340-124368-0018 IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE BY THE FIRST CONGRESS WHICH SAT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AN ACT WAS PASSED TO ENFORCE THE ORDINANCE OF EIGHTY SEVEN INCLUDING THE PROHIBITION OF SLAVERY IN THE NORTHWESTERN TERRITORY
340-124368-0019 IN THIS CONGRESS THERE WERE SIXTEEN OF THE THIRTY NINE FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION THEY WERE JOHN LANGDON NICHOLAS GILMAN WM S JOHNNSON ROGER SHERMAN ROBERT MORRIS THOS FITZSIMMONS
340-124368-0020 WILLIAM FEW ABRAHAM BALDWIN RUFUS KING WILLIAM PATERSON GEORGE CLAIMER RICHARD BASSETT GEORGE READ PIERCE BUTLER DANIEL CARROLL JAMES MADISON
340-124368-0021 ELSE BOTH THEIR FIDELITY TO CORRECT PRINCIPLES AND THEIR OATH TO SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION WOULD HAVE CONSTRAINED THEM TO OPPOSE THE PROHIBITION AGAIN GEORGE WASHINGTON ANOTHER OF THE THIRTY NINE
340-124368-0022 NO GREAT WHILE AFTER THE ADOPTION OF THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION NORTH CAROLINA CEDED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE COUNTRY NOW CONSTITUTING THE STATE OF TENNESSEE AND A FEW YEARS LATER GEORGIA CEDED THAT WHICH NOW CONSTITUTES THE STATES OF MISSISSIPPI AND ALABAMA
340-124368-0023 IN BOTH DEEDS OF CESSION IT WAS MADE A CONDITION BY THE CEDING STATES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT PROHIBIT SLAVERY IN THE CEDED COUNTRY BESIDES THIS SLAVERY WAS THEN ACTUALLY IN THE CEDED COUNTRY
340-124368-0024 UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES CONGRESS ON TAKING CHARGE OF THESE COUNTRIES DID NOT ABSOLUTELY PROHIBIT SLAVERY WITHIN THEM BUT THEY DID INTERFERE WITH IT TAKE CONTROL OF IT EVEN THERE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
340-124368-0025 CONGRESS ORGANIZED THE TERRITORY OF MISSISSIPPI IN THE ACT OF ORGANIZATION THEY PROHIBITED THE BRINGING OF SLAVES INTO THE TERRITORY FROM ANY PLACE WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES BY FINE AND GIVING FREEDOM TO SLAVES SO BROUGHT
340-124368-0026 THIS ACT PASSED BOTH BRANCHES OF CONGRESS WITHOUT YEAS AND NAYS IN THAT CONGRESS WERE THREE OF THE THIRTY NINE WHO FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION THEY WERE JOHN LANGDON GEORGE READ AND ABRAHAM BALDWIN
340-124368-0027 THEY ALL PROBABLY VOTED FOR IT CERTAINLY THEY WOULD HAVE PLACED THEIR OPPOSITION TO IT UPON RECORD IF IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING ANY LINE DIVIDING LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANYTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION
340-124368-0028 IN EIGHTEEN O THREE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PURCHASED THE LOUISIANA COUNTRY OUR FORMER TERRITORIAL ACQUISITIONS CAME FROM CERTAIN OF OUR OWN STATES BUT THIS LOUISIANA COUNTRY WAS ACQUIRED FROM A FOREIGN NATION
340-124368-0029 THERE WERE OTHER CONSIDERABLE TOWNS AND SETTLEMENTS AND SLAVERY WAS EXTENSIVELY AND THOROUGHLY INTERMINGLED WITH THE PEOPLE CONGRESS DID NOT IN THE TERRITORIAL ACT PROHIBIT SLAVERY BUT THEY DID INTERFERE WITH IT TAKE CONTROL OF IT
340-124368-0030 IN A MORE MARKED AND EXTENSIVE WAY THAN THEY DID IN THE CASE OF MISSISSIPPI THE SUBSTANCE OF THE PROVISION THEREIN MADE IN RELATION TO SLAVES WAS FIRST THAT NO SLAVE SHOULD BE IMPORTED INTO THE TERRITORY FROM FOREIGN PARTS
340-124368-0031 SECOND THAT NO SLAVE SHOULD BE CARRIED INTO IT WHO HAD BEEN IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES SINCE THE FIRST DAY OF MAY SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT THIRD THAT NO SLAVE SHOULD BE CARRIED INTO IT EXCEPT BY THE OWNER AND FOR HIS OWN USE AS A SETTLER
340-124368-0032 THEY WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED IT TO PASS WITHOUT RECORDING THEIR OPPOSITION TO IT IF IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING IT VIOLATED EITHER THE LINE PROPERLY DIVIDING LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANY PROVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION
340-124368-0033 NO LINE DIVIDING LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY NOR ANYTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION WAS VIOLATED BY CONGRESS PROHIBITING SLAVERY IN FEDERAL TERRITORY WHILE MISTER PINCKNEY
340-124368-0034 THERE WAS SOME SUFFICIENT REASON FOR OPPOSING SUCH PROHIBITION IN THAT CASE THE CASES I HAVE MENTIONED ARE THE ONLY ACTS OF THE THIRTY NINE OR OF ANY OF THEM UPON THE DIRECT ISSUE WHICH I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER
340-124368-0035 TO ENUMERATE THE PERSONS WHO THUS ACTED AS BEING FOUR IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR TWO IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN SEVENTEEN IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE
340-124368-0036 THE TRUE NUMBER OF THOSE OF THE THIRTY NINE WHOM I HAVE SHOWN TO HAVE ACTED UPON THE QUESTION WHICH BY THE TEXT THEY UNDERSTOOD BETTER THAN WE IS TWENTY THREE LEAVING SIXTEEN NOT SHOWN TO HAVE ACTED UPON IT IN ANY WAY
340-124368-0037 ACTED UPON THE VERY QUESTION WHICH THE TEXT AFFIRMS THEY UNDERSTOOD JUST AS WELL AND EVEN BETTER THAN WE DO NOW AND TWENTY ONE OF THEM A CLEAR MAJORITY OF THE WHOLE THIRTY NINE SO ACTING UPON IT
340-124368-0038 AS TO MAKE THEM GUILTY OF GROSS POLITICAL IMPROPRIETY AND WILFUL PERJURY IF IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING ANY PROPER DIVISION BETWEEN LOCAL AND FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANYTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION THEY HAD MADE THEMSELVES AND SWORN TO SUPPORT
340-124368-0039 FORBADE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN THE FEDERAL TERRITORIES THUS THE TWENTY ONE ACTED AND AS ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS SO ACTIONS UNDER SUCH RESPONSIBILITIES SPEAK STILL LOUDER
340-124368-0040 IN THE INSTANCES IN WHICH THEY ACTED UPON THE QUESTION BUT FOR WHAT REASONS THEY SO VOTED IS NOT KNOWN
340-124368-0041 OR SOME PROVISION OR PRINCIPLE OF THE CONSTITUTION STOOD IN THE WAY OR THEY MAY WITHOUT ANY SUCH QUESTION HAVE VOTED AGAINST THE PROHIBITION ON WHAT APPEARED TO THEM TO BE SUFFICIENT GROUNDS OF EXPEDIENCY
340-124368-0042 NO ONE WHO HAS SWORN TO SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION CAN CONSCIENTIOUSLY VOTE FOR WHAT HE UNDERSTANDS TO BE AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL MEASURE HOWEVER EXPEDIENT HE MAY THINK IT BUT ONE MAY AND OUGHT TO VOTE AGAINST A MEASURE
340-124368-0043 WHICH HE DEEMS CONSTITUTIONAL IF AT THE SAME TIME HE DEEMS IT INEXPEDIENT IT THEREFORE WOULD BE UNSAFE TO SET DOWN EVEN THE TWO WHO VOTED AGAINST THE PROHIBITION AS HAVING DONE SO BECAUSE IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING
340-124368-0044 BUT THERE IS MUCH REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR UNDERSTANDING UPON THAT QUESTION WOULD NOT HAVE APPEARED DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THEIR TWENTY THREE COMPEERS HAD IT BEEN MANIFESTED AT ALL FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADHERING RIGIDLY TO THE TEXT
340-124368-0045 I HAVE PURPOSELY OMITTED WHATEVER UNDERSTANDING MAY HAVE BEEN MANIFESTED BY ANY PERSON HOWEVER DISTINGUISHED OTHER THAN THE THIRTY NINE FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION AND FOR THE SAME REASON
340-124368-0046 IF WE SHOULD LOOK INTO THEIR ACTS AND DECLARATIONS ON THOSE OTHER PHASES AS THE FOREIGN SLAVE TRADE AND THE MORALITY AND POLICY OF SLAVERY GENERALLY IT WOULD APPEAR TO US THAT ON THE DIRECT QUESTION OF FEDERAL CONTROL OF SLAVERY IN FEDERAL TERRITORIES
340-124368-0047 WHILE THERE WAS NOT ONE NOW KNOWN
340-124368-0048 OF SOUTH CAROLINA THE SUM OF THE WHOLE IS THAT OF OUR THIRTY NINE FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION TWENTY ONE A CLEAR MAJORITY OF THE WHOLE CERTAINLY UNDERSTOOD THAT NO PROPER DIVISION OF LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY
340-124368-0049 NOR ANY PART OF THE CONSTITUTION
340-124368-0050 SUCH UNQUESTIONABLY WAS THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION AND THE TEXT AFFIRMS THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION BETTER THAN WE
340-124368-0051 BUT SO FAR I HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE QUESTION MANIFESTED BY THE FRAMERS OF THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION IN AND BY THE ORIGINAL INSTRUMENT A MODE WAS PROVIDED FOR AMENDING IT
340-124368-0052 AND AS I HAVE ALREADY STATED THE PRESENT FRAME OF THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE CONSISTS OF THAT ORIGINAL AND TWELVE AMENDATORY ARTICLES FRAMED AND ADOPTED SINCE
340-124368-0053 THOSE WHO NOW INSIST THAT FEDERAL CONTROL OF SLAVERY IN FEDERAL TERRITORIES VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION POINT US TO THE PROVISIONS WHICH THEY SUPPOSE IT THUS VIOLATES AND AS I UNDERSTAND
340-124368-0054 WHICH PROVIDES THAT NO PERSON SHALL BE DEPRIVED OF LIFE LIBERTY OR PROPERTY WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW WHILE SENATOR DOUGLAS AND HIS PECULIAR ADHERENTS PLANT THEMSELVES UPON THE TENTH AMENDMENT
340-124368-0055 ARE RESERVED TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY OR TO THE PEOPLE NOW IT SO HAPPENS THAT THESE AMENDMENTS WERE FRAMED BY THE FIRST CONGRESS WHICH SAT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION THE IDENTICAL CONGRESS WHICH PASSED THE ACT ALREADY MENTIONED
340-124368-0056 ENFORCING THE PROHIBITION OF SLAVERY IN THE NORTHWESTERN TERRITORY NOT ONLY WAS IT THE SAME CONGRESS BUT THEY WERE THE IDENTICAL SAME INDIVIDUAL MEN WHO AT THE SAME SESSION AND AT THE SAME TIME WITHIN THE SESSION
340-124368-0057 HAD UNDER CONSIDERATION AND IN PROGRESS TOWARD MATURITY THESE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS AND THIS ACT PROHIBITING SLAVERY IN ALL THE TERRITORY THE NATION THEN OWNED THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS WERE INTRODUCED BEFORE
340-124368-0058 AND PASSED AFTER THE ACT ENFORCING THE ORDINANCE OF EIGHTY SEVEN SO THAT DURING THE WHOLE PENDENCY OF THE ACT TO ENFORCE THE ORDINANCE THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS WERE ALSO PENDING THE SEVENTY SIX MEMBERS OF THAT CONGRESS
340-124368-0059 INCLUDING SIXTEEN OF THE FRAMERS OF THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION AS BEFORE STATED WERE PRE EMINENTLY OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THAT PART OF THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE WHICH IS NOW CLAIMED AS FORBIDDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL SLAVERY IN THE FEDERAL TERRITORIES
340-124368-0060 IS IT NOT A LITTLE PRESUMPTUOUS IN ANY ONE AT THIS DAY TO AFFIRM THAT THE TWO THINGS WHICH THAT CONGRESS DELIBERATELY FRAMED
340-124368-0061 AND DOES NOT SUCH AFFIRMATION BECOME IMPUDENTLY ABSURD WHEN COUPLED WITH THE OTHER AFFIRMATION FROM THE SAME MOUTH THAT THOSE WHO DID THE TWO THINGS ALLEGED TO BE INCONSISTENT
340-124368-0062 UNDERSTOOD WHETHER THEY REALLY WERE INCONSISTENT BETTER THAN WE BETTER THAN HE WHO AFFIRMS THAT THEY ARE INCONSISTENT IT IS SURELY SAFE TO ASSUME THAT THE THIRTY NINE FRAMERS OF THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION
340-124368-0063 DECLARED THAT IN HIS UNDERSTANDING ANY PROPER DIVISION OF LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANY PART OF THE CONSTITUTION FORBADE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN THE FEDERAL TERRITORIES I GO A STEP FURTHER
340-124368-0064 PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENT CENTURY AND I MIGHT ALMOST SAY PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST HALF OF THE PRESENT CENTURY DECLARE THAT IN HIS UNDERSTANDING ANY PROPER DIVISION OF LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANY PART OF THE CONSTITUTION
340-124368-0065 I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY WE ARE BOUND TO FOLLOW IMPLICITLY IN WHATEVER OUR FATHERS DID TO DO SO WOULD BE TO DISCARD ALL THE LIGHTS OF CURRENT EXPERIENCE TO REJECT ALL PROGRESS ALL IMPROVEMENT
340-124368-0066 WE SHOULD DO SO UPON EVIDENCE SO CONCLUSIVE AND ARGUMENT SO CLEAR THAT EVEN THEIR GREAT AUTHORITY
340-124368-0067 CANNOT STAND AND MOST SURELY NOT IN A CASE WHEREOF WE OURSELVES DECLARE THEY UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION BETTER THAN WE IF ANY MAN AT THIS DAY SINCERELY BELIEVES THAT PROPER DIVISION OF LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY
340-124368-0068 OR ANY PART OF THE CONSTITUTION FORBIDS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN THE FEDERAL TERRITORIES HE IS RIGHT TO SAY SO AND TO ENFORCE HIS POSITION BY ALL TRUTHFUL EVIDENCE AND FAIR ARGUMENT WHICH HE CAN
340-124368-0069 BUT HE HAS NO RIGHT TO MISLEAD OTHERS WHO HAVE LESS ACCESS TO HISTORY AND LESS LEISURE TO STUDY IT INTO THE FALSE BELIEF THAT OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE WERE OF THE SAME OPINION
340-124368-0070 THUS SUBSTITUTING FALSEHOOD AND DECEPTION FOR TRUTHFUL EVIDENCE AND FAIR ARGUMENT IF ANY MAN AT THIS DAY SINCERELY BELIEVES OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE USED AND APPLIED PRINCIPLES IN OTHER CASES
340-124368-0071 BRAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DECLARING THAT IN HIS OPINION HE UNDERSTANDS THEIR PRINCIPLES BETTER THAN THEY DID THEMSELVES AND ESPECIALLY SHOULD HE NOT SHIRK THAT RESPONSIBILITY BY ASSERTING THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION JUST AS WELL
340-124368-0072 AND EVEN BETTER THAN WE DO NOW BUT ENOUGH LET ALL WHO BELIEVE THAT OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE UNDERSTOOD THIS QUESTION JUST AS WELL AND EVEN BETTER THAN WE DO NOW SPEAK AS THEY SPOKE
340-124368-0073 AND ACT AS THEY ACTED UPON IT THIS IS ALL REPUBLICANS ASK ALL REPUBLICANS DESIRE IN RELATION TO SLAVERY AS THOSE FATHERS MARKED IT SO LET IT BE AGAIN MARKED AS AN EVIL NOT TO BE EXTENDED
340-124368-0074 BUT TO BE TOLERATED AND PROTECTED ONLY BECAUSE OF AND SO FAR AS ITS ACTUAL PRESENCE AMONG US MAKES THAT TOLERATION AND PROTECTION A NECESSITY LET ALL THE GUARANTIES THOSE FATHERS GAVE IT BE NOT GRUDGINGLY
340-124368-0075 BUT FULLY AND FAIRLY MAINTAINED FOR THIS REPUBLICANS CONTEND AND WITH THIS SO FAR AS I KNOW OR BELIEVE THEY WILL BE CONTENT AND NOW IF THEY WOULD LISTEN AS I SUPPOSE THEY WILL NOT
340-124368-0076 AND I CONSIDER THAT IN THE GENERAL QUALITIES OF REASON AND JUSTICE YOU ARE NOT INFERIOR TO ANY OTHER PEOPLE STILL WHEN YOU SPEAK OF US REPUBLICANS YOU DO SO ONLY TO DENOUNCE US AS REPTILES OR AT THE BEST
340-124368-0077 AS NO BETTER THAN OUTLAWS YOU WILL GRANT A HEARING TO PIRATES OR MURDERERS BUT NOTHING LIKE IT TO BLACK REPUBLICANS IN ALL YOUR CONTENTIONS WITH ONE ANOTHER EACH OF YOU DEEMS AN UNCONDITIONAL CONDEMNATION OF BLACK REPUBLICANISM
340-124368-0078 AS THE FIRST THING TO BE ATTENDED TO INDEED SUCH CONDEMNATION OF US SEEMS TO BE AN INDISPENSABLE PREREQUISITE LICENSE SO TO SPEAK AMONG YOU TO BE ADMITTED OR PERMITTED TO SPEAK AT ALL NOW CAN YOU OR NOT
340-124368-0079 OR EVEN TO YOURSELVES BRING FORWARD YOUR CHARGES AND SPECIFICATIONS AND THEN BE PATIENT LONG ENOUGH TO HEAR US DENY OR JUSTIFY YOU SAY WE ARE SECTIONAL WE DENY IT
340-124368-0080 THAT MAKES AN ISSUE AND THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS UPON YOU YOU PRODUCE YOUR PROOF AND WHAT IS IT
340-124368-0081 WE SHOULD THEREBY CEASE TO BE SECTIONAL YOU CANNOT ESCAPE THIS CONCLUSION AND YET ARE YOU WILLING TO ABIDE BY IT IF YOU ARE YOU WILL PROBABLY SOON FIND THAT WE HAVE CEASED TO BE SECTIONAL
340-124368-0082 FOR WE SHALL GET VOTES IN YOUR SECTION THIS VERY YEAR YOU WILL THEN BEGIN TO DISCOVER AS THE TRUTH PLAINLY IS THAT YOUR PROOF DOES NOT TOUCH THE ISSUE THE FACT THAT WE GET NO VOTES IN YOUR SECTION IS A FACT OF YOUR MAKING
340-124368-0083 THAT FAULT IS PRIMARILY YOURS
340-124368-0084 THAT WE REPEL YOU BY SOME WRONG PRINCIPLE OR PRACTICE IF WE DO REPEL YOU BY ANY WRONG PRINCIPLE OR PRACTICE THE FAULT IS OURS
340-124368-0085 AND ARE JUSTLY OPPOSED AND DENOUNCED AS SUCH MEET US THEN ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OUR PRINCIPLE PUT IN PRACTICE WOULD WRONG YOUR SECTION
340-124368-0086 AS IF IT WERE POSSIBLE THAT SOMETHING MAY BE SAID ON OUR SIDE DO YOU ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE NO THEN YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE PRINCIPLE WHICH OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE
340-124368-0087 LESS THAN EIGHT YEARS BEFORE WASHINGTON GAVE THAT WARNING HE HAD AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES APPROVED AND SIGNED AN ACT OF CONGRESS ENFORCING THE PROHIBITION OF SLAVERY IN THE NORTHWESTERN TERRITORY
340-124368-0088 WHICH ACT EMBODIED THE POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT UPON THAT SUBJECT UP TO AND AT THE VERY MOMENT HE PENNED THAT WARNING AND ABOUT ONE YEAR AFTER HE PENNED IT HE WROTE LA FAYETTE THAT HE CONSIDERED THAT PROHIBITION A WISE MEASURE EXPRESSING IN THE SAME CONNECTION
340-124368-0089 HIS HOPE THAT WE SHOULD AT SOME TIME HAVE A CONFEDERACY OF FREE STATES BEARING THIS IN MIND AND SEEING THAT SECTIONALISM HAS SINCE ARISEN UPON THIS SAME SUBJECT IS THAT WARNING A WEAPON IN YOUR HANDS AGAINST US
340-124368-0090 AND WE COMMEND IT TO YOU TOGETHER WITH HIS EXAMPLE POINTING TO THE RIGHT APPLICATION OF IT BUT YOU SAY YOU ARE CONSERVATIVE EMINENTLY CONSERVATIVE WHILE WE ARE REVOLUTIONARY DESTRUCTIVE OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT
340-124368-0091 THE IDENTICAL OLD POLICY ON THE POINT IN CONTROVERSY WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE WHILE YOU WITH ONE ACCORD REJECT AND SCOUT AND SPIT UPON THAT OLD POLICY AND INSIST UPON SUBSTITUTING SOMETHING NEW
340-124368-0092 SOME OF YOU ARE FOR REVIVING THE FOREIGN SLAVE TRADE SOME FOR A CONGRESSIONAL SLAVE CODE FOR THE TERRITORIES SOME FOR CONGRESS FORBIDDING THE TERRITORIES TO PROHIBIT SLAVERY WITHIN THEIR LIMITS SOME FOR MAINTAINING SLAVERY IN THE TERRITORIES THROUGH THE JUDICIARY
340-124368-0093 THAT IF ONE MAN WOULD ENSLAVE ANOTHER NO THIRD MAN SHOULD OBJECT FANTASTICALLY CALLED POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY
340-124368-0094 ACCORDING TO THE PRACTICE OF OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE NOT ONE OF ALL YOUR VARIOUS PLANS CAN SHOW A PRECEDENT OR AN ADVOCATE IN THE CENTURY WITHIN WHICH OUR GOVERNMENT ORIGINATED CONSIDER THEN
340-124368-0095 WHETHER YOUR CLAIM OF CONSERVATISM FOR YOURSELVES AND YOUR CHARGE OF DESTRUCTIVENESS AGAINST US ARE BASED ON THE MOST CLEAR AND STABLE FOUNDATIONS AGAIN YOU SAY WE HAVE MADE THE SLAVERY QUESTION MORE PROMINENT THAN IT FORMERLY WAS
340-124368-0096 WE RESISTED AND STILL RESIST YOUR INNOVATION AND THENCE COMES THE GREATER PROMINENCE OF THE QUESTION
340-124368-0097 WHAT HAS BEEN WILL BE AGAIN UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS IF YOU WOULD HAVE THE PEACE OF THE OLD TIMES READOPT THE PRECEPTS AND POLICY OF THE OLD TIMES YOU CHARGE THAT WE STIR UP INSURRECTIONS AMONG YOUR SLAVES WE DENY IT
340-124368-0098 AND WHAT IS YOUR PROOF HARPER'S FERRY JOHN BROWN JOHN BROWN WAS NO REPUBLICAN AND YOU HAVE FAILED TO IMPLICATE A SINGLE REPUBLICAN IN HIS HARPER'S FERRY ENTERPRISE
340-124368-0099 IF ANY MEMBER OF OUR PARTY IS GUILTY IN THAT MATTER YOU KNOW IT OR YOU DO NOT KNOW IT IF YOU DO KNOW IT YOU ARE INEXCUSABLE FOR NOT DESIGNATING THE MAN AND PROVING THE FACT IF YOU DO NOT KNOW IT YOU ARE INEXCUSABLE FOR ASSERTING IT
340-124368-0100 AND ESPECIALLY FOR PERSISTING IN THE ASSERTION AFTER YOU HAVE TRIED AND FAILED TO MAKE THE PROOF YOU NEED NOT BE TOLD THAT PERSISTING IN A CHARGE WHICH ONE DOES NOT KNOW TO BE TRUE IS SIMPLY MALICIOUS SLANDER
340-124368-0101 SOME OF YOU ADMIT THAT NO REPUBLICAN DESIGNEDLY AIDED OR ENCOURAGED THE HARPER'S FERRY AFFAIR BUT STILL INSIST THAT OUR DOCTRINES AND DECLARATIONS NECESSARILY LEAD TO SUCH RESULTS WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT
340-124368-0102 WE KNOW WE HOLD TO NO DOCTRINE AND MAKE NO DECLARATION WHICH WERE NOT HELD TO AND MADE BY OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE YOU NEVER DEALT FAIRLY BY US IN RELATION TO THIS AFFAIR WHEN IT OCCURRED
340-124368-0103 EVERY REPUBLICAN MAN KNEW THAT AS TO HIMSELF AT LEAST
340-124368-0104 REPUBLICAN DOCTRINES AND DECLARATIONS ARE ACCOMPANIED WITH A CONTINUED PROTEST AGAINST ANY INTERFERENCE WHATEVER WITH YOUR SLAVES OR WITH YOU ABOUT YOUR SLAVES SURELY THIS DOES NOT ENCOURAGE THEM TO REVOLT
340-124368-0105 IN COMMON WITH OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE DECLARE OUR BELIEF THAT SLAVERY IS WRONG BUT THE SLAVES DO NOT HEAR US DECLARE EVEN THIS FOR ANY THING WE SAY OR DO
340-124368-0106 THE SLAVES WOULD SCARCELY KNOW THERE IS A REPUBLICAN PARTY I BELIEVE THEY WOULD NOT IN FACT
340-124368-0107 BLOOD AND THUNDER AMONG THE SLAVES SLAVE INSURRECTIONS ARE NO MORE COMMON NOW THAN THEY WERE BEFORE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS ORGANIZED WHAT INDUCED THE SOUTHAMPTON INSURRECTION TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AGO
340-124368-0108 IN WHICH AT LEAST THREE TIMES AS MANY LIVES WERE LOST AS AT HARPER'S FERRY YOU CAN SCARCELY STRETCH YOUR VERY ELASTIC FANCY TO THE CONCLUSION THAT SOUTHAMPTON WAS GOT UP BY BLACK REPUBLICANISM
340-124368-0109 I DO NOT THINK A GENERAL OR EVEN A VERY EXTENSIVE SLAVE INSURRECTION IS POSSIBLE THE INDISPENSABLE CONCERT OF ACTION CANNOT BE ATTAINED THE SLAVES HAVE NO MEANS OF RAPID COMMUNICATION NOR CAN INCENDIARY FREEMEN BLACK OR WHITE SUPPLY IT
340-124368-0110 THE EXPLOSIVE MATERIALS ARE EVERYWHERE IN PARCELS BUT THERE NEITHER ARE NOR CAN BE SUPPLIED THE INDISPENSABLE CONNECTING TRAINS MUCH IS SAID BY SOUTHERN PEOPLE ABOUT THE AFFECTION OF SLAVES FOR THEIR MASTERS AND MISTRESSES
340-124368-0111 AND A PART OF IT AT LEAST IS TRUE A PLOT FOR AN UPRISING COULD SCARCELY BE DEVISED AND COMMUNICATED TO TWENTY INDIVIDUALS BEFORE SOME ONE OF THEM TO SAVE THE LIFE OF A FAVORITE MASTER OR MISTRESS WOULD DIVULGE IT
340-124368-0112 IN THAT CASE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY WERE ADMITTED TO THE SECRET AND YET ONE OF THEM IN HIS ANXIETY TO SAVE A FRIEND BETRAYED THE PLOT TO THAT FRIEND AND BY CONSEQUENCE AVERTED THE CALAMITY
340-124368-0113 OCCASIONAL POISONINGS FROM THE KITCHEN AND OPEN OR STEALTHY ASSASSINATIONS IN THE FIELD AND LOCAL REVOLTS EXTENDING TO A SCORE OR SO WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR AS THE NATURAL RESULTS OF SLAVERY
340-124368-0114 IN THE LANGUAGE OF MISTER JEFFERSON UTTERED MANY YEARS AGO IT IS STILL IN OUR POWER TO DIRECT THE PROCESS OF EMANCIPATION AND DEPORTATION PEACEABLY
