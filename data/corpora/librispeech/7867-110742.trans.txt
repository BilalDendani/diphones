7867-110742-0000 AGREEABLY TO MY PROMISE I NOW RELATE TO YOU ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE LOST MAN AND CHILD WHICH I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COLLECT IT IS ENTIRELY OWING TO THE HUMANE INTEREST YOU SEEMED TO TAKE IN THE REPORT THAT I HAVE PURSUED THE INQUIRY TO THE FOLLOWING RESULT
7867-110742-0001 YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT BUSINESS CALLED ME TO BOSTON IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY I SAILED IN THE PACKET TO PROVIDENCE AND WHEN I ARRIVED THERE I LEARNED THAT EVERY SEAT IN THE STAGE WAS ENGAGED I WAS THUS OBLIGED EITHER TO WAIT A FEW HOURS
7867-110742-0002 OR ACCEPT A SEAT WITH THE DRIVER WHO CIVILLY OFFERED ME THAT ACCOMMODATION ACCORDINGLY I TOOK MY SEAT BY HIS SIDE AND SOON FOUND HIM INTELLIGENT AND COMMUNICATIVE WHEN WE HAD TRAVELLED ABOUT TEN MILES THE HORSES SUDDENLY THREW THEIR EARS ON THEIR NECKS AS FLAT AS A HARE'S SAID THE DRIVER
7867-110742-0003 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS NOT A CLOUD VISIBLE IN THE FIRMAMENT SOON AFTER A SMALL SPECK APPEARED IN THE ROAD THERE SAID MY COMPANION COMES THE STORM BREEDER HE ALWAYS LEAVES A SCOTCH MIST BEHIND HIM
7867-110742-0004 BY MANY A WET JACKET DO I REMEMBER HIM I SUPPOSE THE POOR FELLOW SUFFERS MUCH HIMSELF MUCH MORE THAN IS KNOWN TO THE WORLD PRESENTLY A MAN WITH A CHILD BESIDE HIM WITH A LARGE BLACK HORSE
7867-110742-0005 HE WILL TELL YOU HE CANNOT STAY A MOMENT FOR HE MUST REACH BOSTON THAT NIGHT WE WERE NOW ASCENDING A HIGH HILL IN WALPOLE AND AS WE HAD A FAIR VIEW OF THE HEAVENS I WAS RATHER DISPOSED TO JEER THE DRIVER FOR THINKING OF HIS SURTOUT
7867-110742-0006 AND WHEN AT THE HEIGHT THE DRIVER POINTED OUT IN AN EASTERN DIRECTION A LITTLE BLACK SPECK AS BIG AS A HAT
7867-110742-0007 WE MAY POSSIBLY REACH POLLEY'S BEFORE IT REACHES US BUT THE WANDERER AND HIS CHILD WILL GO TO PROVIDENCE THROUGH RAIN THUNDER AND LIGHTNING AND NOW THE HORSES AS THOUGH TAUGHT BY INSTINCT HASTENED WITH INCREASED SPEED
7867-110742-0008 THE LITTLE BLACK CLOUD CAME ON ROLLING OVER THE TURNPIKE AND DOUBLED AND TREBLED ITSELF IN ALL DIRECTIONS THE APPEARANCE OF THIS CLOUD ATTRACTED THE NOTICE OF ALL THE PASSENGERS FOR AFTER IT HAD SPREAD ITSELF TO A GREAT BULK
7867-110742-0009 THE DRIVER BESPOKE MY ATTENTION TO A REMARKABLE CONFIGURATION IN THE CLOUD HE SAID EVERY FLASH OF LIGHTNING NEAR ITS CENTRE DISCOVERED TO HIM DISTINCTLY THE FORM OF A MAN SITTING IN AN OPEN CARRIAGE DRAWN BY A BLACK HORSE
7867-110742-0010 IT WAS SOON OVER THE CLOUD PASSING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TURNPIKE TOWARD PROVIDENCE
7867-110742-0011 THE MAN AND CHILD IN THE CHAIR HAVING EXCITED SOME LITTLE SYMPATHY AMONG THE PASSENGERS THE GENTLEMAN WAS ASKED IF HE HAD OBSERVED THEM HE SAID HE HAD MET THEM THAT THE MAN SEEMED BEWILDERED AND INQUIRED THE WAY TO BOSTON
7867-110742-0012 THAT HE WAS DRIVING AT GREAT SPEED AS THOUGH HE EXPECTED TO OUTSTRIP THE TEMPEST THAT THE MOMENT HE HAD PASSED HIM A THUNDERCLAP BROKE DISTINCTLY OVER THE MAN'S HEAD AND SEEMED TO ENVELOP BOTH MAN AND CHILD HORSE AND CARRIAGE I STOPPED SAID THE GENTLEMAN SUPPOSING THE LIGHTNING HAD STRUCK HIM
7867-110742-0013 BUT THE HORSE ONLY SEEMED TO LOOM UP AND INCREASE HIS SPEED AND AS WELL AS I COULD JUDGE HE TRAVELLED JUST AS FAST AS THE THUNDER CLOUD WHILE THIS MAN WAS SPEAKING A PEDDLER WITH A CART OF TIN MERCHANDISE CAME UP ALL DRIPPING
7867-110742-0014 WITHIN A FORTNIGHT IN FOUR DIFFERENT STATES THAT AT EACH TIME HE HAD INQUIRED THE WAY TO BOSTON AND THAT A THUNDER SHOWER LIKE THE PRESENT HAD EACH TIME DELUGED HIM HIS WAGON AND HIS WARES SETTING HIS TIN POTS ET CETERA AFLOAT
7867-110742-0015 SO THAT HE HAD DETERMINED TO GET MARINE INSURANCE DONE FOR THE FUTURE BUT THAT WHICH EXCITED HIS SURPRISE MOST WAS THE STRANGE CONDUCT OF HIS HORSE
7867-110742-0016 FOR THAT LONG BEFORE HE COULD DISTINGUISH THE MAN IN THE CHAIR HIS OWN HORSE STOOD STILL IN THE ROAD AND FLUNG BACK HIS EARS IN SHORT SAID THE PEDDLER
7867-110742-0017 THIS IS ALL THAT I COULD LEARN AT THAT TIME AND THE OCCURRENCE SOON AFTER WOULD HAVE BECOME WITH ME LIKE ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHICH HAD NEVER HAPPENED HAD I NOT AS I STOOD RECENTLY ON THE DOORSTEP OF BENNETT'S HOTEL IN HARTFORD HEARD A MAN SAY
7867-110742-0018 THERE GOES PETER RUGG AND HIS CHILD HE LOOKS WET AND WEARY AND FARTHER FROM BOSTON THAN EVER
7867-110742-0019 FOR WHOEVER HAS ONCE SEEN PETER RUGG CAN NEVER AFTER BE DECEIVED AS TO HIS IDENTITY PETER RUGG SAID I AND WHO IS PETER RUGG THAT SAID THE STRANGER IS MORE THAN ANYONE CAN TELL EXACTLY
7867-110742-0020 AY SAID A BYSTANDER THAT IS A THOUGHT BRIGHT ONLY ON ONE SIDE HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE IN THAT CASE TO SEND A LETTER TO BOSTON FOR PETER HAS ALREADY TO MY KNOWLEDGE BEEN MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS TRAVELLING TO THAT PLACE BUT
7867-110742-0021 UNDER WHICH PETER RUGG NOW LABOURS I CANNOT SAY THEREFORE I AM RATHER INCLINED TO PITY THAN TO JUDGE YOU SPEAK LIKE A HUMANE MAN SAID I AND IF YOU HAVE KNOWN HIM SO LONG I PRAY YOU WILL GIVE ME SOME ACCOUNT OF HIM
7867-110742-0022 HAS HIS APPEARANCE MUCH ALTERED IN THAT TIME WHY YES HE LOOKS AS THOUGH HE NEVER ATE DRANK OR SLEPT AND HIS CHILD LOOKS OLDER THAN HIMSELF AND HE LOOKS LIKE TIME BROKE OFF FROM ETERNITY AND ANXIOUS TO GAIN A RESTING PLACE
7867-110742-0023 AND HOW DOES HIS HORSE LOOK SAID I AS FOR HIS HORSE HE LOOKS FATTER AND GAYER AND SHOWS MORE ANIMATION AND COURAGE THAN HE DID TWENTY YEARS AGO THE LAST TIME RUGG SPOKE TO ME HE INQUIRED HOW FAR IT WAS TO BOSTON I TOLD HIM JUST ONE HUNDRED MILES
7867-110742-0024 BUT SAID I YOU ARE NOW TRAVELLING FROM BOSTON YOU MUST TURN BACK ALAS SAID HE IT IS ALL TURN BACK BOSTON SHIFTS WITH THE WIND AND PLAYS ALL AROUND THE COMPASS ONE MAN TELLS ME IT IS TO THE EAST ANOTHER TO THE WEST
7867-110742-0025 STOP THEN AND REFRESH YOURSELF
7867-110742-0026 IS PETER RUGG HIS REAL NAME OR HAS HE ACCIDENTALLY GAINED THAT NAME I KNOW NOT BUT PRESUME HE WILL NOT DENY HIS NAME YOU CAN ASK HIM FOR SEE HE HAS TURNED HIS HORSE AND IS PASSING THIS WAY
7867-110742-0027 SIR SAID I MAY I BE SO BOLD AS TO INQUIRE IF YOU ARE NOT MISTER RUGG FOR I THINK I HAVE SEEN YOU BEFORE
7867-110742-0028 YOU LIVE IN BOSTON DO YOU AND IN WHAT STREET IN MIDDLE STREET WHEN DID YOU LEAVE BOSTON
7867-110742-0029 WHY THE OLD ROAD IS ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN MILES AND THE TURNPIKE IS NINETY SEVEN HOW CAN YOU SAY SO YOU IMPOSE ON ME IT IS WRONG TO TRIFLE WITH A TRAVELLER YOU KNOW IT IS BUT FORTY MILES FROM NEWBURYPORT TO BOSTON
7867-110742-0030 HE SEEMED TO DEVOUR ALL BEFORE HIM AND TO SCORN ALL BEHIND
7867-110742-0031 THE STRANGER ASKED FOR MISSUS RUGG AND WAS INFORMED THAT MISSUS RUGG HAD DIED AT A GOOD OLD AGE MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS BEFORE THAT TIME THE STRANGER REPLIED HOW CAN YOU DECEIVE ME SO DO ASK MISSUS RUGG TO STEP TO THE DOOR
7867-110742-0032 BUT SAID THE STRANGER IT SEEMS TO BE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE STREET INDEED EVERYTHING HERE SEEMS TO BE MISPLACED THE STREETS ARE ALL CHANGED THE PEOPLE ARE ALL CHANGED THE TOWN SEEMS CHANGED
7867-110742-0033 AND WHAT IS STRANGEST OF ALL CATHARINE RUGG HAS DESERTED HER HUSBAND AND CHILD PRAY SAID THE STRANGER
7867-110742-0034 HE WENT A LONG VOYAGE HE IS MY KINSMAN IF I COULD SEE HIM HE COULD GIVE ME SOME ACCOUNT OF MISSUS RUGG SIR SAID MISSUS CROFT I NEVER HEARD OF JOHN FOY WHERE DID HE LIVE JUST ABOVE HERE IN ORANGE TREE LANE THERE IS NO SUCH PLACE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD
7867-110742-0035 NO SUCH STREET AS KING STREET WHY WOMAN YOU MOCK ME YOU MAY AS WELL TELL ME THERE IS NO KING GEORGE HOWEVER MADAM YOU SEE I AM WET AND WEARY I MUST FIND A RESTING PLACE I WILL GO TO HART'S TAVERN NEAR THE MARKET
7867-110742-0036 WHICH MARKET SIR FOR YOU SEEM PERPLEXED WE HAVE SEVERAL MARKETS YOU KNOW THERE IS BUT ONE MARKET NEAR THE TOWN DOCK
7867-110742-0037 BUT NO SUCH MAN AS HART HAS KEPT THERE THESE TWENTY YEARS HERE THE STRANGER SEEMED DISCONCERTED AND MUTTERED TO HIMSELF QUITE AUDIBLY STRANGE MISTAKE
7867-110742-0038 SOME OTHER MISSUS RUGG SOME OTHER MIDDLE STREET
7867-110742-0039 I PERCEIVE MY MISTAKE THERE IS A FERRY BETWEEN BOSTON AND CHARLESTOWN THERE IS NO BRIDGE AH I PERCEIVE MY MISTAKE IF I WAS IN BOSTON MY HORSE WOULD CARRY ME DIRECTLY TO MY OWN DOOR BUT MY HORSE SHOWS BY HIS IMPATIENCE THAT HE IS IN A STRANGE PLACE
7867-110742-0040 ABSURD THAT I SHOULD HAVE MISTAKEN THIS PLACE FOR THE OLD TOWN OF BOSTON IT IS A MUCH FINER CITY THAN THE TOWN OF BOSTON IT HAS BEEN BUILT LONG SINCE BOSTON I FANCY BOSTON MUST LIE AT A DISTANCE FROM THIS CITY AS THE GOOD WOMAN SEEMS IGNORANT OF IT
7867-110742-0041 AT THESE WORDS HIS HORSE BEGAN TO CHAFE AND STRIKE THE PAVEMENT WITH HIS FORE FEET THE STRANGER SEEMED A LITTLE BEWILDERED AND SAID NO HOME TO NIGHT AND GIVING THE REINS TO HIS HORSE PASSED UP THE STREET AND I SAW NO MORE OF HIM
7867-110742-0042 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE GENERATION TO WHICH PETER RUGG BELONGED HAD PASSED AWAY THIS WAS ALL THE ACCOUNT OF PETER RUGG I COULD OBTAIN FROM MISSUS CROFT BUT SHE DIRECTED ME TO AN ELDERLY MAN MISTER JAMES FELT WHO LIVED NEAR HER
7867-110742-0043 BUT AS IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS THAT MEN RUN AWAY SOMETIMES TO BE RID OF OTHERS AND SOMETIMES TO BE RID OF THEMSELVES AND AS RUGG TOOK HIS CHILD WITH HIM AND HIS OWN HORSE AND CHAIR AND AS IT DID NOT APPEAR THAT ANY CREDITORS MADE A STIR
7867-110742-0044 WHY MY FRIEND SAID JAMES FELT THAT PETER RUGG IS NOW A LIVING MAN I WILL NOT DENY BUT THAT YOU HAVE SEEN PETER RUGG AND HIS CHILD IS IMPOSSIBLE IF YOU MEAN A SMALL CHILD
7867-110742-0045 BOSTON MASSACRE SEVENTEEN SEVENTY JENNY RUGG WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD WHY SIR JENNY RUGG IF LIVING MUST BE MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS OF AGE THAT PETER RUGG IS LIVING IS HIGHLY PROBABLE AS HE WAS ONLY TEN YEARS OLDER THAN MYSELF
7867-110742-0046 HERE I PERCEIVED THAT MISTER FELT WAS IN HIS DOTAGE AND I DESPAIRED OF GAINING ANY INTELLIGENCE FROM HIM ON WHICH I COULD DEPEND I TOOK MY LEAVE OF MISSUS CROFT AND PROCEEDED TO MY LODGINGS AT THE MARLBOROUGH HOTEL IF PETER RUGG THOUGHT I
7867-110742-0047 HAS BEEN TRAVELLING SINCE THE BOSTON MASSACRE THERE IS NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD NOT TRAVEL TO THE END OF TIME IF THE PRESENT GENERATION KNOW LITTLE OF HIM THE NEXT WILL KNOW LESS AND PETER AND HIS CHILD WILL HAVE NO HOLD ON THIS WORLD
7867-110742-0048 IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING I RELATED MY ADVENTURE IN MIDDLE STREET HA SAID ONE OF THE COMPANY SMILING
7867-110742-0049 I HAVE HEARD MY GRANDFATHER SPEAK OF HIM AS THOUGH HE SERIOUSLY BELIEVED HIS OWN STORY SIR SAID I PRAY LET US COMPARE YOUR GRANDFATHER'S STORY OF MISTER RUGG
7867-110742-0050 AND THEN HIS LANGUAGE WAS TERRIBLE IN THESE FITS OF PASSION IF A DOOR STOOD IN HIS WAY HE WOULD NEVER DO LESS THAN KICK A PANEL THROUGH HE WOULD SOMETIMES THROW HIS HEELS OVER HIS HEAD AND COME DOWN ON HIS FEET UTTERING OATHS IN A CIRCLE
7867-110742-0051 AND DID WHAT OTHERS HAVE SINCE LEARNED TO DO FOR MERRIMENT AND MONEY ONCE RUGG WAS SEEN TO BITE A TENPENNY NAIL IN HALVES IN THOSE DAYS EVERYBODY BOTH MEN AND BOYS WORE WIGS AND
7867-110742-0052 WHILE THESE FITS WERE ON HIM RUGG HAD NO RESPECT FOR HEAVEN OR EARTH
7867-110742-0053 ONE MORNING THAT RUGG IN HIS OWN CHAIR WITH A FINE LARGE BAY HORSE TOOK HIS DAUGHTER AND PROCEEDED TO CONCORD ON HIS RETURN A VIOLENT STORM OVERTOOK HIM AT DARK HE STOPPED IN MENOTOMY
7867-110742-0054 YOU ARE IN AN OPEN CHAIR AND THE TEMPEST IS INCREASING LET THE STORM INCREASE SAID RUGG WITH A FEARFUL OATH I WILL SEE HOME TO NIGHT IN SPITE OF THE LAST TEMPEST OR MAY I NEVER SEE HOME
7867-110742-0055 AT THESE WORDS HE GAVE HIS WHIP TO HIS HIGH SPIRITED HORSE AND DISAPPEARED IN A MOMENT BUT PETER RUGG DID NOT REACH HOME THAT NIGHT NOR THE NEXT NOR WHEN HE BECAME A MISSING MAN COULD HE EVER BE TRACED BEYOND MISTER CUTTER'S IN MENOTOMY
7867-110742-0056 FOR A LONG TIME AFTER ON EVERY DARK AND STORMY NIGHT THE WIFE OF PETER RUGG WOULD FANCY SHE HEARD THE CRACK OF A WHIP AND THE FLEET TREAD OF A HORSE AND THE RATTLING OF A CARRIAGE PASSING HER DOOR
7867-110742-0057 AND SAW THE REAL PETER RUGG WITH HIS OWN HORSE AND CHAIR AND CHILD SITTING BESIDE HIM PASS DIRECTLY BEFORE HIS OWN DOOR HIS HEAD TURNING TOWARD HIS HOUSE AND HIMSELF MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO STOP HIS HORSE BUT IN VAIN
7867-110742-0058 THE NEXT DAY THE FRIENDS OF MISSUS RUGG EXERTED THEMSELVES TO FIND HER HUSBAND AND CHILD THEY INQUIRED AT EVERY PUBLIC HOUSE AND STABLE IN TOWN BUT IT DID NOT APPEAR THAT RUGG MADE ANY STAY IN BOSTON NO ONE
7867-110742-0059 AFTER RUGG HAD PASSED HIS OWN DOOR COULD GIVE ANY ACCOUNT OF HIM THOUGH IT WAS ASSERTED BY SOME THAT THE CLATTER OF RUGG'S HORSE AND CARRIAGE OVER THE PAVEMENTS SHOOK THE HOUSES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET
7867-110742-0060 AND THIS IS CREDIBLE IF INDEED RUGG'S HORSE AND CARRIAGE DID PASS ON THAT NIGHT FOR AT THIS DAY IN MANY OF THE STREETS A LOADED TRUCK OR TEAM IN PASSING WILL SHAKE THE HOUSES LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE
7867-110742-0061 HOWEVER RUGG'S NEIGHBOURS NEVER AFTERWARD WATCHED AGAIN SOME OF THEM TREATED IT ALL AS A DELUSION AND THOUGHT NO MORE OF IT OTHERS OF A DIFFERENT OPINION SHOOK THEIR HEADS AND SAID NOTHING
7867-110742-0062 PASSING THROUGH THE COUNTRY LIKE A STREAK OF CHALK THIS GAVE OCCASION TO RUGG'S FRIENDS TO MAKE FURTHER INQUIRY BUT THE MORE THEY INQUIRED THE MORE THEY WERE BAFFLED IF THEY HEARD OF RUGG ONE DAY IN CONNECTICUT THE NEXT DAY THEY HEARD OF HIM WINDING AROUND THE HILLS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
7867-110742-0063 CHARLESTOWN BRIDGE THE TOLL GATHERER ASSERTED THAT SOMETIMES ON THE DARKEST AND MOST STORMY NIGHTS WHEN NO OBJECT COULD BE DISCERNED ABOUT THE TIME RUGG WAS MISSING A HORSE AND WHEELCARRIAGE WITH A NOISE EQUAL TO A TROOP
7867-110742-0064 WOULD AT MIDNIGHT IN UTTER CONTEMPT OF THE RATES OF TOLL PASS OVER THE BRIDGE THIS OCCURRED SO FREQUENTLY THAT THE TOLL GATHERER RESOLVED TO ATTEMPT A DISCOVERY SOON AFTER AT THE USUAL TIME
7867-110742-0065 APPARENTLY THE SAME HORSE AND CARRIAGE APPROACHED THE BRIDGE FROM CHARLESTOWN SQUARE
7867-110742-0066 AND WHEN QUESTIONED SEEMED ANXIOUS TO WAIVE THE SUBJECT AND THUS PETER RUGG AND HIS CHILD HORSE AND CARRIAGE REMAIN A MYSTERY TO THIS DAY THIS SIR
