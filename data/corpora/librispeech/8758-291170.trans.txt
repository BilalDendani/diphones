8758-291170-0000 ONLY TO BE RESORTED TO ON RAINY DAYS OR OF A NIGHT WHEN TOO RESTLESS TO SLEEP IT STANDS TO PUSSY IN THE SAME RELATION THAT INDOOR CROQUET BILLIARDS OR READING A BOOK IN BED DOES TO OUR NOBLE SELVES RAT CATCHING IS ONLY JUST ONE DEGREE BETTER
8758-291170-0001 AND PRINCIPALLY ENJOYED BY CATS WHO HAVE NOT REACHED MATURITY IN BODY AND INTELLECT CATS IN FACT IN THEIR HOBBLE DE HOY HOOD TO THE MATURED CAT ESPECIALLY IF HIGHLY BRED BELONG ALL THE JOYS AND EXCITEMENT OF THE CHASE A FIELD
8758-291170-0002 THERE IS AS MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HUNTING OF AN ANIMAL OF THE CAT KIND AND THAT OF ONE OF THE CANINE ORDER AS THERE IS BETWEEN THE SKILLED TACTICS OF GERMAN WARFARE AND THE WILD RUSH TO BATTLE OF ARAB CAVALRY THERE IS MORE HONESTY IN THE ONE
8758-291170-0003 MORE CRAFT AND CUNNING IN THE OTHER A DOG IS SINGULARLY DESTITUTE IN WHAT IS CALLED IN SCOTLAND CANNINESS HE ALSO WANTS PATIENCE BUT THE CAT ARMED WITH THIS GIFT COMBINED WITH CUNNING AND SKILL GAINED FROM EXPERIENCE
8758-291170-0004 IS MASTER FOR ANYTHING IN THE FIELD WHICH SHE CONSIDERS GAME AND CHOOSES TO SQUARE HER MOUSTACHE AT EVEN TO A HUMAN BEING STALKING ONE'S PREY IS INFINITELY MORE ENGROSSING THAN THE MERE HUNTING OF IT
8758-291170-0005 THE LATTER IS PLEASING CERTAINLY BUT THE FORMER IS CHARMING PUSSY PREFERS THE CHARMING WHILE OUR FRIEND THE DOG MERELY RUNS DOWN HIS PREY AND TAKES LITTLE PAINS TO SHOW SKILL EVEN IN THAT
8758-291170-0006 LEAVING RATS AND MICE ALONG WITH BLUE BOTTLE FLIES IN THE CATEGORY OF MERE KITTEN'S PLAY PUSSY'S GAME LIST INCLUDES HARES RABBITS STOATS WEASELS WATER RATS AND MOLES BESIDES EVERYTHING THAT FLIES OR HAS FEATHERS
8758-291170-0007 FROM THE HUMBLE HOUSEHOLD SPARROW TO THE BLACK COCK OF THE MOUNTAIN NOT BEFORE A CAT REACHES MATURITY VIZ THREE YEARS OF AGE DOES THE PROPENSITY FOR OUT DOOR HUNTING BECOME A PASSION WITH HER BUT ONCE IMBUED WITH IT THE DESIRE NEVER LEAVES HER AS LONG AS SHE CAN RUN
8758-291170-0008 PIRNIE IS A LITTLE FEMALE PUSSY BELONGING TO A LABOURING MAN AT THE TIME I WRITE SHE IS OVER TWENTY YEARS OLD BUT HALE AND HEARTY AND AS PLAYFUL AS A KITTEN
8758-291170-0009 BUT MORE PARTICULARLY GOES IN FOR MOLE CATCHING WHEN SHE SPIES A MOLE HILL SHE AT ONCE SETS HERSELF DOWN TO WATCH IT NOR WILL SHE RAISE THE SIEGE FOR HOURS UNTIL THE LITTLE GENTLEMAN IN VELVET GIVES SIGNS OF HIS PRESENCE BY CASTING UP A FEW GRAINS OF EARTH
8758-291170-0010 THEN IS PUSSY'S OPPORTUNITY SHE SPRINGS NIMBLY ON THE BANK AND PLUNGES HER ARMS UP TO THE SHOULDERS INTO THE EARTH AND NEVER FAILS TO BRING POOR MOLIE TO BANK AND THE DAYLIGHT HAS HARDLY HAD TIME TO DAZZLE HIS EYES BEFORE HE IS DEAD
8758-291170-0011 WHEN PIRNIE STUMBLED ACROSS ITS TRAIL AND ON FOLLOWING IT UP THE BATTLE ENSUED THE HARE SAYS MY INFORMANT FOUGHT WITH GREAT VIGOUR AND OFTEN FLOORED HER ANTAGONIST BUT PIRNIE SENT IN HER CLAWS AND TEETH TILL BLOOD FLEW LIKE RAIN
8758-291170-0012 AND FUR LIKE DRIFT DRIVEN SNOW AND THE HARE SOON BECOMING EXHAUSTED PIRNIE SEIZED IT BY THE THROAT AND ITS PLAINTIVE SCREAMS WERE PRESENTLY HUSHED IN DEATH GRAYSIE WAS A TOM CAT AND RATHER FAMOUS FOR HIS HUNTING EXPLOITS ONE DAY
8758-291170-0013 THE BATTLE WAS WITNESSED BY GRAYSIE'S OWNERS AND LASTED THE GREATER PART OF THE AFTERNOON AND ENDED TRIUMPHANTLY FOR PUSSY IN THE DEFEAT AND DEATH OF THE WEASEL WHEN GRAYSIE FOUND OUT THAT HIS FALLEN FOE WAS INDEED DEAD
8758-291170-0014 INTENDING IT NO DOUBT AS A PRESENT FOR HIS MISTRESS
8758-291170-0015 A CAT NEVER SPRINGS ON HER PREY UNLESS SURE OF CATCHING IT AND HER AIM IS MOST UNERRING I KNOW A CAT THAT KILLED OVER A SCORE OF LARGE RATS IN ONE DAY AND ON ONE OF THESE SHE SPRANG FROM A HEIGHT OF NO LESS THAN TWELVE FEET
8758-291170-0016 I COUNTED ONE DAY NO LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MICE WHICH A CAT HAD KILLED SINGLE HANDED AT THE REMOVAL OF A RICK OF OATS IN A FARMER'S YARD HE WAS A FINE NOBLE RED TABBY
8758-291170-0017 AND IT WAS QUITE A SIGHT TO SEE THE SURPRISING STRENGTH AND AGILITY WITH WHICH HE WORKED HE KILLED MOST OF THEM WITH HIS PAWS SELDOM PUTTING A TOOTH IN ONE EVERY TIME THERE WAS A LULL IN THE FLOW OF VERMIN
8758-291170-0018 HE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF CLEARING THE GROUND OF THE SLAIN WHICH HE CARRIED TO A CONVENIENT DISTANCE AND PLACED ALL TOGETHER IN A HEAP WHEN ALL WAS OVER TO SEE HONEST TOM SET HIMSELF DOWN IN FRONT OF THIS HEAP OF CARNAGE
8758-291170-0019 THEY MUCH PREFER FISH TO ANYTHING ELSE AND THE FLESH OF BIRDS THEY CONSIDER A GREATER LUXURY THAN EVEN THAT OF RABBITS SOLOMON OR HABAKKUK OR NEBUCHADNEZZAR OR SOME GREAT HEBREW AUTHORITY SAYS CONEYS ARE A FEEBLE FOLK
8758-291170-0020 DOUBTLESS THEY WERE SO IN THOSE DAYS AND TAKEN SINGLY SO THEY ARE IN OUR DAY BUT COMBINEDLY THEY ARE POWERFUL INDEED AS MANY A POOR RUINED FARMER CAN TESTIFY
8758-291170-0021 THEY ARE VERY WISE TOO AND THIS WISDOM IS ESPECIALLY DISPLAYED IN THE NUMBER OF DOORS THEY HAVE IN EACH OF THEIR DWELLINGS SO THAT SHOULD AN ENEMY IN THE SHAPE OF A PUSSY OR A FERRET POP IN AT ONE DOOR BUNNY WOULD JUST POP OUT AT THE OTHER
8758-291170-0022 I KNEW A CAT IN THE ISLE OF MAN SHE HAD NO TAIL WORTH MENTIONING WHO USED TO MAKE THIS VERY HABIT OF THE RABBITS A MEANS OF SECURING HER PREY SHE USED TO ENTER ONE HOLE SUDDENLY AND AS SUDDENLY REAPPEAR STERN FIRST
8758-291170-0023 OF COURSE BUNNY BY THIS TIME WAS SCAMPERING OFF TO THE OPPOSITE HOLE AND THERE AT THE DOOR PUSSY WOULD NAB HIM JUST AS HE CAME OUT CATS ALMOST INVARIABLY BRING HOME THEIR PREY TO BE EITHER LEISURELY EATEN
8758-291170-0024 GIVEN TO THEIR KITTENS OR PRESENTED TO THEIR OWNERS A MAN IN BANFFSHIRE RENTED A SMALL FARM FROM A GAME PRESERVING LAIRD THIS MAN WAS RUINED BY RABBITS AND TURNED OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME BY THEM
8758-291170-0025 THEY FIRST ATE UP ALL HIS OATS HIS GRASS AND TURNIPS SO THAT ONLY POTATOES COULD BE GROWN ON THE PLACE BY AND BY THEY TOOK TO EATING THE STEMS OF EVEN THOSE AS SOON AS THEY APPEARED ABOVE GROUND SO THAT ALL THE POOR MAN'S LIVE STOCK WAS REDUCED TO ONE IN NUMBER
8758-291170-0026 NAMELY A BIG TABBY CAT THIS CAT THROVE UPON THE FOE SHE ALSO TOOK A FEW YOUTHFUL PRISONERS WHOM SHE BROUGHT HOME TO PLAY WITH AND AMUSE A FINE FAMILY OF KITTENS WHICH SHE HAD IN THE COTTAGE GARRET THESE YOUNG RABBITS LIVED AND GREW
8758-291170-0027 AND BURROWED AND MADE NESTS IN THE THATCH IT WAS THE AWFUL ROW THIS HAPPY FAMILY USED TO MAKE EVERY NIGHT WHICH FIRST LED TO THE DISCOVERY WHEN THE FARMER FOUND OUT ONE NIGHT THE CAUSE OF THE DISTURBANCE HE CAME DOWN AND AWAKENED HIS WIFE AND JANE SAID HE
8758-291170-0028 AND HE LOOKED ALMOST SUBLIME AS HE STOOD ON THE COLD DAMP FLOOR WITH A PENNY CANDLE IN ONE HAND IN RATHER SCANTY SHIRT TAILS AND RED KILMARNOCK NIGHT CAP HE WAS A STUDY FOR A REMBRANDT JANE
8758-291170-0029 LEAVING PUSSY AND THE FEEBLE FOLKS IN UNDISPUTED POSSESSION OF HOUSE AND FARM GAMEKEEPERS DO ALL THEY CAN TO DESTROY THE LIFE OF POOR PUSSY BY SETTING TRAPS FOR AND SHOOTING HER WHEREVER MET BUT SOME CATS COME TO KNOW ALL ABOUT THE TREACHEROUS WIRES AND HOW TO AVOID THEM
8758-291170-0030 THEY KNOW TOO THAT HARES AND RABBITS OFTEN FALL INTO THESE SNARES AND ACCORDINGLY THEY TURN THIS KNOWLEDGE TO GOOD ACCOUNT AND WHEN THEY FIND A HALF STRANGLED ANIMAL IN THE GIN THEY QUIETLY DESPATCH AND IF POSSIBLE CARRY IT HOME
8758-291170-0031 PUSSY HAS MANY ENEMIES TO CONTEND WITH ON THE HUNTING GROUND A POACHER THE OTHER DAY WAS RETURNING HOME IN THE GREY LIGHT OF EARLY MORNING WHEN HE OBSERVED A LARGE FOX COMING IN HIS DIRECTION WITH WHAT THE MAN TOOK TO BE A HARE OVER HIS SHOULDER
8758-291170-0032 THE MAN FIRED AND REYNARD DROPPED HIS BURDEN WAS A FINE LARGE CAT POOR PUSSY HAD BEEN PROMISING HERSELF A NICE PLUMP RABBIT FOR BREAKFAST
8758-291170-0033 THERE'S MANY A SLIP TWIXT THE CUP AND THE LIP AND THE POACHER'S GUN BROUGHT MATTERS TO QUITE A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION I KNOW A CASE OF A CAT THAT RETURNED FROM HUNTING WITH TWO MODERATE SIZED BUT FULL GROWN RATS IN HER MOUTH AND BOTH ALIVE AND STARING
8758-291170-0034 THEY WERE NO DOUBT SITTING CHEEK BY JOWL WHEN PUSSY MADE THE SPRING IF I TELL THE READER OF A CAT THAT IS SO CLEVER THAT SHE CAN CATCH SWALLOWS ON THE WING I SUPPOSE I MAY BE ALLOWED TO CLOSE THIS CHAPTER IN PEACE IT DOES SEEM A LITTLE YANKEE DOODLISH I CONFESS
