4734-220951-0000 NATURE IS GOVERNED BY ONE UNIVERSAL LAW NATURE IS THAT CONDITION THAT REALITY WHICH IN APPEARANCE CONSISTS IN LIFE AND DEATH OR IN OTHER WORDS IN THE COMPOSITION AND DECOMPOSITION OF ALL THINGS
4734-220951-0001 THIS NATURE IS SUBJECTED TO AN ABSOLUTE ORGANIZATION TO DETERMINED LAWS TO A COMPLETE ORDER AND A FINISHED DESIGN FROM WHICH IT WILL NEVER DEPART TO SUCH A DEGREE INDEED
4734-220951-0002 FROM THE SMALLEST INVISIBLE ATOM UP TO SUCH LARGE BODIES OF THE WORLD OF EXISTENCE AS THE GLOBE OF THE SUN OR THE OTHER GREAT STARS AND LUMINOUS SPHERES WHETHER YOU REGARD THEIR ARRANGEMENT THEIR COMPOSITION THEIR FORM OR THEIR MOVEMENT
4734-220951-0003 YOU WILL FIND THAT ALL ARE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF ORGANIZATION
4734-220951-0004 BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT NATURE ITSELF YOU SEE THAT IT HAS NO INTELLIGENCE NO WILL FOR INSTANCE THE NATURE OF FIRE IS TO BURN IT BURNS WITHOUT WILL OR INTELLIGENCE THE NATURE OF WATER IS FLUIDITY
4734-220951-0005 IT FLOWS WITHOUT WILL OR INTELLIGENCE THE NATURE OF THE SUN IS RADIANCE IT SHINES WITHOUT WILL OR INTELLIGENCE THE NATURE OF VAPOR IS TO ASCEND IT ASCENDS WITHOUT WILL OR INTELLIGENCE
4734-220951-0006 THUS IT IS CLEAR THAT THE NATURAL MOVEMENTS OF ALL THINGS ARE COMPELLED THERE ARE NO VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS EXCEPT THOSE OF ANIMALS AND ABOVE ALL THOSE OF MAN
4734-220951-0007 AND TO OPPOSE NATURE BECAUSE HE DISCOVERS THE CONSTITUTION OF THINGS AND THROUGH THIS HE COMMANDS THE FORCES OF NATURE ALL THE INVENTIONS HE HAS MADE ARE DUE TO HIS DISCOVERY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THINGS FOR EXAMPLE
4734-220951-0008 HE INVENTED THE TELEGRAPH WHICH IS THE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE EAST AND THE WEST IT IS EVIDENT THEN THAT MAN RULES OVER NATURE NOW WHEN YOU BEHOLD IN EXISTENCE SUCH ORGANIZATIONS ARRANGEMENTS AND LAWS
4734-220951-0009 CAN YOU SAY THAT ALL THESE ARE THE EFFECT OF NATURE THOUGH NATURE HAS NEITHER INTELLIGENCE NOR PERCEPTION IF NOT IT BECOMES EVIDENT THAT THIS NATURE WHICH HAS NEITHER PERCEPTION NOR INTELLIGENCE IS IN THE GRASP OF ALMIGHTY GOD
4734-220951-0010 WHO IS THE RULER OF THE WORLD OF NATURE WHATEVER HE WISHES HE CAUSES NATURE TO MANIFEST ONE OF THE THINGS WHICH HAS APPEARED IN THE WORLD OF EXISTENCE AND WHICH IS ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF NATURE IS HUMAN LIFE
4734-220951-0011 CONSIDERED FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW MAN IS THE BRANCH NATURE IS THE ROOT THEN CAN THE WILL AND THE INTELLIGENCE AND THE PERFECTIONS WHICH EXIST IN THE BRANCH BE ABSENT IN THE ROOT
4734-220951-0012 IS IN THE GRASP OF THE POWER OF GOD WHO IS THE ETERNAL ALMIGHTY ONE HE HOLDS NATURE WITHIN ACCURATE REGULATIONS AND LAWS AND RULES OVER IT
4734-220951-0013 PROOFS AND EVIDENCES OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD ONE OF THE PROOFS AND DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD IS THE FACT THAT MAN DID NOT CREATE HIMSELF NAY HIS CREATOR AND DESIGNER IS ANOTHER THAN HIMSELF
4734-220951-0014 IT IS CERTAIN AND INDISPUTABLE THAT THE CREATOR OF MAN IS NOT LIKE MAN BECAUSE A POWERLESS CREATURE CANNOT CREATE ANOTHER BEING THE MAKER THE CREATOR HAS TO POSSESS ALL PERFECTIONS IN ORDER THAT HE MAY CREATE
4734-220951-0015 CAN THE CREATION BE PERFECT AND THE CREATOR IMPERFECT CAN A PICTURE BE A MASTERPIECE AND THE PAINTER IMPERFECT IN HIS ART FOR IT IS HIS ART AND HIS CREATION MOREOVER THE PICTURE CANNOT BE LIKE THE PAINTER
4734-220951-0016 OTHERWISE THE PAINTING WOULD HAVE CREATED ITSELF HOWEVER PERFECT THE PICTURE MAY BE
4734-220951-0017 THE IMPERFECTIONS OF THE CONTINGENT WORLD ARE IN THEMSELVES A PROOF OF THE PERFECTIONS OF GOD FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU LOOK AT MAN YOU SEE THAT HE IS WEAK
4734-220951-0018 BECAUSE IF THERE WERE NO POWER WEAKNESS COULD NOT BE IMAGINED THEN THE WEAKNESS OF THE CREATURE
4734-220951-0019 FOR IF THERE WERE NO POWER THERE COULD BE NO WEAKNESS SO FROM THIS WEAKNESS IT BECOMES EVIDENT THAT THERE IS POWER IN THE WORLD AGAIN IN THE CONTINGENT WORLD THERE IS POVERTY
4734-220951-0020 THEN NECESSARILY WEALTH EXISTS SINCE POVERTY IS APPARENT IN THE WORLD IN THE CONTINGENT WORLD THERE IS IGNORANCE
4734-220951-0021 BECAUSE IGNORANCE IS FOUND FOR IF THERE WERE NO KNOWLEDGE NEITHER WOULD THERE BE IGNORANCE IGNORANCE IS THE NONEXISTENCE OF KNOWLEDGE AND IF THERE WERE NO EXISTENCE NONEXISTENCE COULD NOT BE REALIZED
4734-220951-0022 IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE WHOLE CONTINGENT WORLD IS SUBJECTED TO A LAW AND RULE WHICH IT CAN NEVER DISOBEY EVEN MAN IS FORCED TO SUBMIT TO DEATH TO SLEEP AND TO OTHER CONDITIONS THAT IS TO SAY MAN IN CERTAIN PARTICULARS IS GOVERNED
4734-220951-0023 BECAUSE A CHARACTERISTIC OF CONTINGENT BEINGS IS DEPENDENCY AND THIS DEPENDENCY IS AN ESSENTIAL NECESSITY THEREFORE THERE MUST BE AN INDEPENDENT BEING WHOSE INDEPENDENCE IS ESSENTIAL IN THE SAME WAY IT IS UNDERSTOOD FROM THE MAN WHO IS SICK
4734-220951-0024 THAT THERE MUST BE ONE WHO IS IN HEALTH
4734-220951-0025 THROUGHOUT THE WORLD OF EXISTENCE IT IS THE SAME THE SMALLEST CREATED THING PROVES THAT THERE IS A CREATOR FOR INSTANCE THIS PIECE OF BREAD PROVES THAT IT HAS A MAKER PRAISE BE TO GOD
4734-220951-0026 THE LEAST CHANGE PRODUCED IN THE FORM OF THE SMALLEST THING PROVES THE EXISTENCE OF A CREATOR THEN CAN THIS GREAT UNIVERSE WHICH IS ENDLESS BE SELF CREATED AND COME INTO EXISTENCE FROM THE ACTION OF MATTER AND THE ELEMENTS
4734-220951-0027 THESE OBVIOUS ARGUMENTS ARE ADDUCED FOR WEAK SOULS BUT IF THE INNER PERCEPTION BE OPEN A HUNDRED THOUSAND CLEAR PROOFS BECOME VISIBLE THUS WHEN MAN FEELS THE INDWELLING SPIRIT
4734-220951-0028 HE IS IN NO NEED OF ARGUMENTS FOR ITS EXISTENCE BUT FOR THOSE WHO ARE DEPRIVED OF THE BOUNTY OF THE SPIRIT IT IS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH EXTERNAL ARGUMENTS
4734-220951-0029 THE NEED OF AN EDUCATOR WHEN WE CONSIDER EXISTENCE WE SEE THAT THE MINERAL VEGETABLE ANIMAL AND HUMAN WORLDS ARE ALL IN NEED OF AN EDUCATOR IF THE EARTH IS NOT CULTIVATED
4734-220951-0030 IT BECOMES A JUNGLE WHERE USELESS WEEDS GROW BUT IF A CULTIVATOR COMES AND TILLS THE GROUND IT PRODUCES CROPS WHICH NOURISH LIVING CREATURES IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE SOIL NEEDS THE CULTIVATION OF THE FARMER CONSIDER THE TREES
4734-220951-0031 IF THEY REMAIN WITHOUT A CULTIVATOR THEY WILL BE FRUITLESS AND WITHOUT FRUIT THEY ARE USELESS BUT IF THEY RECEIVE THE CARE OF A GARDENER
4734-220951-0032 AND THROUGH CULTIVATION FERTILIZATION AND ENGRAFTING THE TREES WHICH HAD BITTER FRUITS YIELD SWEET FRUITS THESE ARE RATIONAL PROOFS IN THIS AGE THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD NEED THE ARGUMENTS OF REASON
4734-220951-0033 THE SAME IS TRUE WITH RESPECT TO ANIMALS NOTICE THAT WHEN THE ANIMAL IS TRAINED IT BECOMES DOMESTIC AND ALSO THAT MAN
4734-220951-0034 BECOMES BESTIAL AND MOREOVER IF LEFT UNDER THE RULE OF NATURE BECOMES LOWER THAN AN ANIMAL
4734-220951-0035 IF THERE WERE NO EDUCATOR THERE WOULD BE NO SUCH THINGS AS COMFORTS CIVILIZATION
4734-220951-0036 IF A MAN BE LEFT ALONE IN A WILDERNESS WHERE HE SEES NONE OF HIS OWN KIND HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BECOME A MERE BRUTE IT IS THEN CLEAR THAT AN EDUCATOR IS NEEDED BUT EDUCATION IS OF THREE KINDS MATERIAL HUMAN
4734-220951-0037 AND SPIRITUAL MATERIAL EDUCATION IS CONCERNED WITH THE PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE BODY
4734-220951-0038 THIS EDUCATION IS COMMON TO ANIMALS AND MAN HUMAN EDUCATION SIGNIFIES CIVILIZATION AND PROGRESS THAT IS TO SAY GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION CHARITABLE WORKS TRADES ARTS AND HANDICRAFTS SCIENCES
4734-220951-0039 DIVINE EDUCATION IS THAT OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD IT CONSISTS IN ACQUIRING DIVINE PERFECTIONS AND THIS IS TRUE EDUCATION
4734-220951-0040 THE MANIFESTATION OF THE WORDS LET US MAKE MAN IN OUR IMAGE
4734-220951-0041 NOW WE NEED AN EDUCATOR WHO WILL BE AT THE SAME TIME A MATERIAL HUMAN AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATOR AND WHOSE AUTHORITY WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN ALL CONDITIONS SO IF ANYONE SHOULD SAY I POSSESS PERFECT COMPREHENSION AND INTELLIGENCE
4734-220951-0042 AND I HAVE NO NEED OF SUCH AN EDUCATOR HE WOULD BE DENYING THAT WHICH IS CLEAR AND EVIDENT AS THOUGH A CHILD SHOULD SAY I HAVE NO NEED OF EDUCATION I WILL ACT ACCORDING TO MY REASON AND INTELLIGENCE AND SO I SHALL ATTAIN THE PERFECTIONS OF EXISTENCE
4734-220951-0043 OR AS THOUGH THE BLIND SHOULD SAY I AM IN NO NEED OF SIGHT BECAUSE MANY OTHER BLIND PEOPLE EXIST WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THEN IT IS PLAIN AND EVIDENT THAT MAN NEEDS AN EDUCATOR
4734-220951-0044 FOR ANY CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY OCCUR
4734-220951-0045 THAT IS TO SAY HE MUST EDUCATE INTELLIGENCE AND THOUGHT IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY MAY ATTAIN COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT SO THAT KNOWLEDGE AND SCIENCE MAY INCREASE AND THE REALITY OF THINGS THE MYSTERIES OF BEINGS AND THE PROPERTIES OF EXISTENCE MAY BE DISCOVERED
4734-220951-0046 AND FROM THINGS PERCEPTIBLE TO THE SENSES CONCLUSIONS AS TO INTELLECTUAL THINGS MAY BE DEDUCED HE MUST ALSO IMPART SPIRITUAL EDUCATION SO THAT INTELLIGENCE AND COMPREHENSION MAY PENETRATE THE METAPHYSICAL WORLD
4734-220951-0047 AND MAY RECEIVE BENEFIT FROM THE SANCTIFYING BREEZE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT AND MAY ENTER INTO RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SUPREME CONCOURSE HE MUST SO EDUCATE THE HUMAN REALITY THAT IT MAY BECOME THE CENTER OF THE DIVINE APPEARANCE
4734-220951-0048 TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THE ATTRIBUTES AND THE NAMES OF GOD SHALL BE RESPLENDENT IN THE MIRROR OF THE REALITY OF MAN
4734-220951-0049 HOW CAN ONE SOLITARY PERSON WITHOUT HELP AND WITHOUT SUPPORT LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF SUCH A NOBLE CONSTRUCTION HE MUST DEPEND ON THE HELP OF THE SPIRITUAL AND DIVINE POWER TO BE ABLE TO UNDERTAKE THIS MISSION
4734-220951-0050 ONE HOLY SOUL GIVES LIFE TO THE WORLD OF HUMANITY CHANGES THE ASPECT OF THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE CAUSES INTELLIGENCE TO PROGRESS VIVIFIES SOULS
4734-220951-0051 BRINGS NATIONS AND RELIGIONS UNDER THE SHADOW OF ONE STANDARD DELIVERS MAN FROM THE WORLD OF IMPERFECTIONS AND VICES AND INSPIRES HIM WITH THE DESIRE AND NEED OF NATURAL AND ACQUIRED PERFECTIONS CERTAINLY
4734-220951-0052 NOTHING SHORT OF A DIVINE POWER COULD ACCOMPLISH SO GREAT A WORK WE OUGHT TO CONSIDER THIS WITH JUSTICE FOR THIS IS THE OFFICE OF JUSTICE A CAUSE WHICH ALL THE GOVERNMENTS AND PEOPLES OF THE WORLD
4734-220951-0053 WITH ALL THEIR POWERS AND ARMIES CANNOT PROMULGATE AND SPREAD ONE HOLY SOUL CAN PROMOTE WITHOUT HELP OR SUPPORT CAN THIS BE DONE BY HUMAN POWER NO IN THE NAME OF GOD
4734-220951-0054 A WORK WHICH ALL THE VICTORIOUS GOVERNMENTS WITH ALL THEIR HOSTS ARE UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH CONSIDER WHAT WAS THE FATE OF SO MANY AND DIVERSE EMPIRES AND PEOPLES THE ROMAN EMPIRE FRANCE GERMANY RUSSIA ENGLAND
4734-220951-0055 ALL WERE GATHERED TOGETHER UNDER THE SAME TENT THAT IS TO SAY THE APPEARANCE OF CHRIST BROUGHT ABOUT A UNION AMONG THESE DIVERSE NATIONS SOME OF WHOM UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CHRISTIANITY
4734-220951-0056 SYRIANS EGYPTIANS PHOENICIANS ISRAELITES AND OTHER PEOPLES OF EUROPE
4734-220951-0057 AND HE MUST POSSESS A SUPERNATURAL POWER SO THAT HE MAY HOLD THE POSITION OF A DIVINE TEACHER IF HE DOES NOT SHOW FORTH SUCH A HOLY POWER HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EDUCATE FOR IF HE BE IMPERFECT HOW CAN HE GIVE A PERFECT EDUCATION
4734-220951-0058 IF HE BE IGNORANT HOW CAN HE MAKE OTHERS WISE IF HE BE UNJUST HOW CAN HE MAKE OTHERS JUST IF HE BE EARTHLY HOW CAN HE MAKE OTHERS HEAVENLY NOW WE MUST CONSIDER JUSTLY
4734-220951-0059 THEY WERE NOT REAL EDUCATORS THEREFORE IT MUST BE OUR TASK TO PROVE TO THE THOUGHTFUL BY REASONABLE ARGUMENTS THE PROPHETHOOD OF MOSES OF CHRIST AND OF THE OTHER DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS
4734-220951-0060 IT HAS NOW BEEN PROVED BY RATIONAL ARGUMENTS THAT THE WORLD OF EXISTENCE IS IN THE UTMOST NEED OF AN EDUCATOR
