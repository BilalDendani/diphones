1025-92820-0000 PRINCE MICHAEL OF THE ELECTORATE OF VALLELUNA SAT ON HIS FAVOURITE BENCH IN THE PARK THE COOLNESS OF THE SEPTEMBER NIGHT QUICKENED THE LIFE IN HIM LIKE A RARE TONIC WINE THE BENCHES WERE NOT FILLED FOR PARK LOUNGERS WITH THEIR STAGNANT BLOOD
1025-92820-0001 ARE PROMPT TO DETECT AND FLY HOME FROM THE CRISPNESS OF EARLY AUTUMN THE MOON WAS JUST CLEARING THE ROOFS OF THE RANGE OF DWELLINGS THAT BOUNDED THE QUADRANGLE ON THE EAST CHILDREN LAUGHED AND PLAYED ABOUT THE FINE SPRAYED FOUNTAIN
1025-92820-0002 IN THE SHADOWED SPOTS FAUNS AND HAMADRYADS WOOED UNCONSCIOUS OF THE GAZE OF MORTAL EYES A HAND ORGAN PHILOMEL BY THE GRACE OF OUR STAGE CARPENTER FANCY FLUTED AND DRONED IN A SIDE STREET AROUND THE ENCHANTED BOUNDARIES OF THE LITTLE PARK
1025-92820-0003 STREET CARS SPAT AND MEWED AND THE STILTED TRAINS ROARED LIKE TIGERS AND LIONS PROWLING FOR A PLACE TO ENTER AND ABOVE THE TREES SHONE THE GREAT ROUND SHINING FACE OF AN ILLUMINATED CLOCK IN THE TOWER OF AN ANTIQUE PUBLIC BUILDING
1025-92820-0004 PRINCE MICHAEL'S SHOES WERE WRECKED FAR BEYOND THE SKILL OF THE CAREFULLEST COBBLER THE RAGMAN WOULD HAVE DECLINED ANY NEGOTIATIONS CONCERNING HIS CLOTHES
1025-92820-0005 THE TWO WEEKS STUBBLE ON HIS FACE WAS GREY AND BROWN AND RED AND GREENISH YELLOW AS IF IT HAD BEEN MADE UP FROM INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE CHORUS OF A MUSICAL COMEDY NO MAN EXISTED WHO HAD MONEY ENOUGH TO WEAR SO BAD A HAT AS HIS
1025-92820-0006 PRINCE MICHAEL SAT ON HIS FAVOURITE BENCH AND SMILED IT WAS A DIVERTING THOUGHT TO HIM THAT HE WAS WEALTHY ENOUGH TO BUY EVERY ONE OF THOSE CLOSE RANGED BULKY WINDOW LIT MANSIONS THAT FACED HIM IF HE CHOSE
1025-92820-0007 IN THIS PROUD CITY OF MANHATTAN AND SCARCELY HAVE ENTERED UPON THE BULK OF HIS HOLDINGS
1025-92820-0008 HE COULD HAVE SAT AT TABLE WITH REIGNING SOVEREIGNS THE SOCIAL WORLD THE WORLD OF ART THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE ELECT ADULATION IMITATION THE HOMAGE OF THE FAIREST HONOURS FROM THE HIGHEST PRAISE FROM THE WISEST FLATTERY ESTEEM CREDIT PLEASURE
1025-92820-0009 OF THE ELECTORATE OF VALLELUNA WHENEVER HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO TAKE IT BUT HIS CHOICE WAS TO SIT IN RAGS AND DINGINESS ON A BENCH IN A PARK FOR HE HAD TASTED OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREE OF LIFE AND FINDING IT BITTER IN HIS MOUTH
1025-92820-0010 HAD STEPPED OUT OF EDEN FOR A TIME TO SEEK DISTRACTION CLOSE TO THE UNARMOURED BEATING HEART OF THE WORLD THESE THOUGHTS STRAYED DREAMILY THROUGH THE MIND OF PRINCE MICHAEL AS HE SMILED UNDER THE STUBBLE OF HIS POLYCHROMATIC BEARD LOUNGING THUS
1025-92820-0011 CLAD AS THE POOREST OF MENDICANTS IN THE PARKS HE LOVED TO STUDY HUMANITY HE FOUND IN ALTRUISM MORE PLEASURE THAN HIS RICHES HIS STATION AND ALL THE GROSSER SWEETS OF LIFE HAD GIVEN HIM
1025-92820-0012 IT WAS HIS CHIEF SOLACE AND SATISFACTION TO ALLEVIATE INDIVIDUAL DISTRESS TO CONFER FAVOURS UPON WORTHY ONES WHO HAD NEED OF SUCCOUR
1025-92820-0013 BESTOWED HOWEVER WITH WISDOM AND JUDICIOUSNESS AND AS PRINCE MICHAEL'S EYE RESTED UPON THE GLOWING FACE OF THE GREAT CLOCK IN THE TOWER
1025-92820-0014 BIG THOUGHTS WERE THE PRINCE'S AND IT WAS ALWAYS WITH A SHAKE OF HIS HEAD THAT HE CONSIDERED THE SUBJUGATION OF THE WORLD TO THE ARBITRARY MEASURES OF TIME THE COMINGS AND GOINGS OF PEOPLE IN HURRY AND DREAD CONTROLLED BY THE LITTLE METAL MOVING HANDS OF A CLOCK ALWAYS MADE HIM SAD
1025-92820-0015 BY AND BY CAME A YOUNG MAN IN EVENING CLOTHES AND SAT UPON THE THIRD BENCH FROM THE PRINCE FOR HALF AN HOUR HE SMOKED CIGARS WITH NERVOUS HASTE AND THEN HE FELL TO WATCHING THE FACE OF THE ILLUMINATED CLOCK ABOVE THE TREES
1025-92820-0016 HIS PERTURBATION WAS EVIDENT AND THE PRINCE NOTED IN SORROW THAT ITS CAUSE WAS CONNECTED IN SOME MANNER WITH THE SLOWLY MOVING HANDS OF THE TIMEPIECE HIS HIGHNESS AROSE AND WENT TO THE YOUNG MAN'S BENCH I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR ADDRESSING YOU HE SAID
1025-92820-0017 BUT I PERCEIVE THAT YOU ARE DISTURBED IN MIND IF IT MAY SERVE TO MITIGATE THE LIBERTY I HAVE TAKEN I WILL ADD THAT I AM PRINCE MICHAEL HEIR TO THE THRONE OF THE ELECTORATE OF VALLELUNA I APPEAR INCOGNITO OF COURSE AS YOU MAY GATHER FROM MY APPEARANCE
1025-92820-0018 IT IS A FANCY OF MINE TO RENDER AID TO OTHERS WHOM I THINK WORTHY OF IT PERHAPS THE MATTER THAT SEEMS TO DISTRESS YOU IS ONE THAT WOULD MORE READILY YIELD TO OUR MUTUAL EFFORTS THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED UP BRIGHTLY AT THE PRINCE
1025-92820-0019 BRIGHTLY BUT THE PERPENDICULAR LINE OF PERPLEXITY BETWEEN HIS BROWS WAS NOT SMOOTHED AWAY HE LAUGHED AND EVEN THEN IT DID NOT BUT HE ACCEPTED THE MOMENTARY DIVERSION GLAD TO MEET YOU PRINCE HE SAID GOOD HUMOUREDLY YES I'D SAY YOU WERE INCOG ALL RIGHT
1025-92820-0020 PRINCE MICHAEL SAT AT THE YOUNG MAN'S SIDE HE WAS OFTEN REBUFFED BUT NEVER OFFENSIVELY HIS COURTEOUS MANNER AND WORDS FORBADE THAT CLOCKS SAID THE PRINCE ARE SHACKLES ON THE FEET OF MANKIND I HAVE OBSERVED YOU LOOKING PERSISTENTLY AT THAT CLOCK
1025-92820-0021 ITS FACE IS THAT OF A TYRANT ITS NUMBERS ARE FALSE AS THOSE ON A LOTTERY TICKET ITS HANDS ARE THOSE OF A BUNCO STEERER WHO MAKES AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOU TO YOUR RUIN
1025-92820-0022 LET ME ENTREAT YOU TO THROW OFF ITS HUMILIATING BONDS AND TO CEASE TO ORDER YOUR AFFAIRS BY THAT INSENSATE MONITOR OF BRASS AND STEEL I DON'T USUALLY SAID THE YOUNG MAN I CARRY A WATCH EXCEPT WHEN I'VE GOT MY RADIANT RAGS ON

1025-92820-0025 THE YOUNG MAN GLANCED AT THE CLOCK AGAIN AND FROWNED DARKLY WHEN HIS GAZE STRAYED FROM THE GLOWING HOROLOGUE OF TIME IT RESTED INTENTLY UPON A FOUR STORY RED BRICK HOUSE IN THE ROW OF DWELLINGS OPPOSITE TO WHERE HE SAT THE SHADES WERE DRAWN AND THE LIGHTS IN MANY ROOMS SHONE DIMLY THROUGH THEM
