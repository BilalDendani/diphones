2039-141209-0000 THE RUSIZI RIVER ACCORDING TO RUHINGA ROSE NEAR A LAKE CALLED KIVO WHICH HE SAID IS AS LONG AS FROM MUGIHAWA
2039-141209-0001 AT FIRST A SMALL RAPID STREAM BUT AS IT PROCEEDS TOWARDS THE LAKE IT RECEIVES THE RIVERS KAGUNISSI KABURAN MOHIRA NYAMAGANA
2039-141209-0002 ON ONE SIDE IS MUTUMBI PROBABLY THE UTUMBI OF SPEKE AND BAKER
2039-141209-0003 ON THE EAST IS URUNDI THE NAME OF THE CHIEF OF KIVO IS KWANSIBURA AFTER SO MANY MINUTE DETAILS ABOUT THE RIVER RUSIZI IT ONLY REMAINED FOR US TO SEE IT ON THE SECOND MORNING OF OUR ARRIVAL AT MUGIHEWA
2039-141209-0004 WE MUSTERED TEN STRONG PADDLERS AND SET OUT TO EXPLORE THE HEAD OF THE LAKE AND THE MOUTH OF THE RUSIZI WE FOUND THAT THE NORTHERN HEAD OF THE LAKE WAS INDENTED WITH SEVEN BROAD BAYS EACH FROM ONE AND A HALF TO THREE MILES BROAD
2039-141209-0005 THE FIRST STARTING FROM WEST TO EAST AT THE BROADEST PART TO THE EXTREME SOUTHERN POINT OF MUGIHEWA WAS ABOUT THREE MILES BROAD AND SERVED AS A LINE OF DEMARCATION BETWEEN MUKAMBA'S DISTRICT OF RUWENGA
2039-141209-0006 THE SECOND BAY WAS A MILE FROM THE SOUTHERN EXTREMITY OF MUGIHEWA TO RUHINGA'S VILLAGE AT THE HEAD OF THE BAY AND IT WAS A MILE ACROSS TO ANOTHER SPIT OF SAND WHICH WAS TERMINATED BY A SMALL ISLAND THE THIRD BAY STRETCHED FOR NEARLY A MILE TO A LONG SPIT
2039-141209-0007 AND WAS THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE FOURTH BAY AT THE HEAD OF WHICH WAS THE DELTA OF THE RUSIZI THIS FOURTH BAY AT ITS BASE WAS ABOUT THREE MILES IN DEPTH AND PENETRATED HALF A MILE FURTHER INLAND THAN ANY OTHER SOUNDINGS INDICATED SIX FEET DEEP
2039-141209-0008 THE CURRENT WAS VERY SLUGGISH NOT MORE THAN A MILE AN HOUR THOUGH WE CONSTANTLY KEPT OUR BINOCULAR SEARCHING FOR THE RIVER WE COULD NOT SEE THE MAIN CHANNEL UNTIL WITHIN TWO HUNDRED YARDS OF IT
2039-141209-0009 THE BAY AT THIS POINT HAD NARROWED FROM TWO MILES TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS IN BREADTH INVITING A CANOE TO SHOW US THE WAY A SMALL FLOTILLA OF CANOES PRECEDED US
2039-141209-0010 WE FOLLOWED AND IN A FEW MINUTES WERE ASCENDING THE STREAM WHICH WAS VERY RAPID THOUGH BUT ABOUT TEN YARDS WIDE AND VERY SHALLOW NOT MORE THAN TWO FEET DEEP WE ASCENDED ABOUT HALF A MILE THE CURRENT BEING VERY STRONG FROM SIX TO EIGHT MILES AN HOUR
2039-141209-0011 WE COULD SEE THAT IT WIDENED AND SPREAD OUT IN A MYRIAD OF CHANNELS RUSHING BY ISOLATED CLUMPS OF SEDGE AND MATETE GRASS AND THAT IT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A SWAMP WE HAD ASCENDED THE CENTRAL OR MAIN CHANNEL THE WESTERN CHANNEL WAS ABOUT EIGHT YARDS BROAD
2039-141209-0012 IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TO ASCEND HIGHER THERE BEING NOTHING ABOUT THE RIVER ITSELF TO REPAY EXPLORATION OF IT THE QUESTION WAS THE RUSIZI AN EFFLUENT OR AN INFLUENT WAS ANSWERED FOR EVER THERE WAS NOW NO DOUBT ANY MORE ON THAT POINT
2039-141209-0013 IN SIZE IT WAS NOT TO BE COMPARED WITH THE MALAGARAZI RIVER NEITHER IS IT OR CAN IT BE NAVIGABLE FOR ANYTHING BUT THE SMALLEST CANOES
2039-141209-0014 THE BAYS TO THE EAST OF THE RUSIZI ARE OF THE SAME CONFORMATION AS THOSE ON THE WEST CAREFULLY JUDGING FROM THE WIDTH OF THE SEVERAL BAYS FROM POINT TO POINT AND OF THE SEVERAL SPITS WHICH SEPARATE THEM
2039-141209-0015 HAD WE CONTENTED OURSELVES WITH SIMPLY LOOKING AT THE CONFORMATION AND THE MEETING OF THE EASTERN AND WESTERN RANGES
2039-141209-0016 BUT ITS EXPLORATION DISSOLVED THAT IDEA CHAMATI HILL IS THE EXTREME NORTHERN TERMINATION OF THE WESTERN RANGE AND SEEMS UPON A SUPERFICIAL EXAMINATION TO ABUT AGAINST THE RAMATA MOUNTAINS OF THE EASTERN RANGE WHICH ARE OPPOSITE CHAMATI
2039-141209-0017 AND THROUGH THIS VALLEY THE RUSIZI FLOWS TOWARDS THE LAKE
2039-141209-0018 THAT SIR SAMUEL BAKER WILL HAVE TO CURTAIL THE ALBERT N'YANZA BY ONE IF NOT TWO DEGREES OF LATITUDE
2039-141209-0019 WHILE RUANDA HAS BEEN PLACED ON THE EASTERN SIDE WHEREAS A LARGE PORTION OF IT IF NOT ALL SHOULD BE PLACED NORTH OF WHAT HE HAS DESIGNATED ON HIS MAP
2039-141209-0020 THE INFORMATION OF SUCH AN INTELLIGENT MAN AS RUHINGA IS NOT TO BE DESPISED FOR IF LAKE ALBERT CAME WITHIN A HUNDRED MILES OF THE TANGANIKA HE WOULD SURELY HAVE HEARD OF ITS EXISTENCE EVEN IF HE HAD NOT SEEN IT HIMSELF
2039-141209-0021 ORIGINALLY HE CAME FROM MUTUMBI AND HE HAS TRAVELLED FROM THAT COUNTRY INTO MUGIHEWA THE DISTRICT HE NOW GOVERNS HE HAS SEEN MWEZI THE GREAT KING OF URUNDI AND DESCRIBES HIM AS A MAN ABOUT FORTY YEARS OLD AND AS A VERY GOOD MAN
2039-141209-0022 OUR WORK WAS NOW DONE THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO DETAIN US AT MUGIHEWA RUHINGA HAD BEEN EXCEEDINGLY KIND AND GIVEN US ONE OX AFTER ANOTHER TO BUTCHER AND EAT
2039-141209-0023 THEIR WOMEN HAD SUPPLIED US WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF MILK AND BUTTER AND WE HAD NOW BOUNTEOUS SUPPLIES OF BOTH
2039-141209-0024 AND MUGIHEWA WAS MADE OUT TO BE IN THREE DEGREES NINETEEN MINUTES S LATITUDE ON THE SEVENTH DECEMBER EARLY IN THE MORNING WE LEFT MUGIHEWA AND ROWING PAST THE SOUTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE KATANGARA ISLANDS
2039-141209-0025 WE APPROACHED THE HIGHLANDS OF UASHI NEAR THE BOUNDARY LINE BETWEEN MUKAMBA'S COUNTRY AND UVIRA THE BOUNDARY LINE IS SUPPOSED TO BE A WIDE RAVINE IN THE DEPTHS OF WHICH IS A GROVE OF TALL BEAUTIFUL AND STRAIGHT STEMMED TREES OUT OF WHICH THE NATIVES MAKE THEIR CANOES
2039-141209-0026 WAS IN SIGHT OF OUR ENCAMPMENT AND AS WE OBSERVED PARTIES OF MEN ASCENDING AND DESCENDING THE MOUNTAINS
2039-141209-0027 WE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE ON OUR COURSE SOUTH
2039-141209-0028 FOR ATTEMPTING AS THE WAVIRA BELIEVED TO EVADE THE HONGA PAYMENT SUCH FACTS AS THESE AND OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE GENERAL STATE OF INSECURITY IN THE COUNTRY RESULTING FROM THE MANY WARS IN WHICH THE DISTRICTS OF THE TANGANIKA WERE ENGAGED DETERMINED US NOT TO HALT AT KAVIMBA
2039-141209-0029 AND HEADED SOUTH AGAINST A STRONG GALE WHICH CAME DRIVING DOWN ON US FROM THE SOUTH WEST AFTER A HARD PULL OF ABOUT TWO HOURS IN THE TEETH OF THE STORM WHICH WAS RAPIDLY RISING WE POINTED THE HEAD OF THE BOAT INTO A LITTLE QUIET COVE
2039-141209-0030 ALMOST HIDDEN IN TALL REEDS AND DISEMBARKED FOR THE NIGHT COGNIZANT OF THE DANGERS WHICH SURROUNDED US KNOWING THAT SAVAGE AND IMPLACABLE MAN WAS THE WORST ENEMY WE HAD TO FEAR
2039-141209-0031 BUT NOT BEFORE WE HAD POSTED WATCHMEN TO GUARD OUR CANOE LEST THE DARING THIEVES OF UVIRA MIGHT ABSTRACT IT IN WHICH CASE WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN A PRETTY PLIGHT AND IN MOST UNENVIABLE DISTRESS
2039-141209-0032 AT DAYBREAK LEAVING KUKUMBA POINT AFTER OUR HUMBLE BREAKFAST OF COFFEE CHEESE AND DOURRA CAKES WAS DESPATCHED WE STEERED SOUTH ONCE MORE OUR FIRES HAD ATTRACTED THE NOTICE OF THE SHARP EYED AND SUSPICIOUS FISHERMEN OF KUKUMBA
2039-141209-0033 BUT OUR PRECAUTIONS AND THE VIGILANT WATCH WE HAD SET BEFORE RETIRING HAD PROVED AN EFFECTUAL SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE KIVIRA THIEVES THE WESTERN SHORES OF THE LAKE AS WE PROCEEDED WERE LOFTIER AND MORE BOLD THAN THE WOODED HEIGHTS OF URUNDI AND BEARDED KNOLLS OF UJIJI
2039-141209-0034 DISCLOSED ITSELF BETWEEN THE SERRATED TOPS OF THE FRONT LINE OF MOUNTAINS WHICH ROSE TO A HEIGHT OF FROM TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TO THREE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE LAKE WITHIN THE FOLDS OF THE FRONT LINE OF MOUNTAINS RISE ISOLATED HILLS OF CONSIDERABLE MAGNITUDE
2039-141209-0035 PRECIPITOUS AND ABRUPT BUT SCENICALLY VERY PICTURESQUE THE GREATER PART OF THESE HILLS HAVE THE ROUNDED AND SMOOTH TOP OR ARE TABULARLY SUMMITED THE RIDGE ENFOLDING THESE HILLS SHOOTS OUT AT INTERVALS
2039-141209-0036 PROMONTORIAL PROJECTIONS OF GRADUAL SLOPING OUTLINES WHICH ON THE MAP I HAVE DESIGNATED CAPES OR POINTS WHEN ROUNDING THESE POINTS UP WENT OUR COMPASSES FOR THE TAKING OF BEARINGS
2039-141209-0037 THE VEGETATION SEEMS TO BE OF SPONTANEOUS GROWTH GROUPS OF THE ELAEIS GUINEANSIS PALM EMBOWERING SOME DUN BROWN VILLAGE
2039-141209-0038 A BROAD EXTENT COVERED WITH VIVID GREEN SORGHUM STALKS PARACHUTE LIKE TOPS OF MIMOSA A LINE OF WHITE SAND ON WHICH NATIVE CANOES ARE DRAWN FAR ABOVE THE REACH OF THE PLANGENT UNEASY SURF
2039-141209-0039 THESE ARE THE SCENES WHICH REVEAL THEMSELVES TO US
2039-141209-0040 WHEN WEARIED WITH THE ROMANCE OF WILD TROPIC SCENES SUCH AS THESE WE HAVE BUT TO LIFT OUR EYES TO THE GREAT MOUNTAIN TOPS LOOMING DARKLY AND GRANDLY ON OUR RIGHT TO WATCH THE LIGHT PENCILLING OF THE CIRRUS BRUSHING THEIR SUMMITS
2039-141209-0041 AND WE KNOW THE STORM WHICH WAS BREWING IS AT HAND AND THAT IT IS TIME TO SEEK SHELTER
2039-141209-0042 AT BEMBA WE HALTED TO TAKE IN PIECES OF PIPE CLAY
2039-141209-0043 WHO THOUGHT US CERTAIN OF SAFE PASSAGE AND GOOD FORTUNE IF WE COMPLIED WITH THE ANCIENT CUSTOM PASSING NGOVI WE CAME TO A DEEP BEND WHICH CURVED OFF TO CAPE KABOGI AT THE DISTANCE OF TEN MILES ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE WAY WE ARRIVED AT A GROUP OF ISLETS
2039-141209-0044 THREE IN NUMBER ALL VERY STEEP AND ROCKY
2039-141209-0045 HERE WE MADE PREPARATIONS TO HALT FOR THE NIGHT
2039-141209-0046 AS THESE ISLANDS WERE WITH DIFFICULTY PRONOUNCED BY US
2039-141209-0047 THE DOCTOR SEEING THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY OBJECTS WE WERE LIKELY TO DISCOVER NAMED THEM THE NEW YORK HERALD ISLETS AND IN CONFIRMATION OF THE NEW DESIGNATION GIVEN THEM SHOOK HANDS WITH ME UPON IT
2039-141209-0048 ACCORDINGLY WE HAD OUR BREAKFAST COOKED AND AS USUAL LAID DOWN FOR AN AFTERNOON NAP I SOON FELL ASLEEP AND WAS DREAMING AWAY IN MY TENT IN HAPPY OBLIVION OF THE STRIFE AND CONTENTION THAT HAD RISEN SINCE I HAD GONE TO SLEEP WHEN I HEARD A VOICE HAILING ME WITH
2039-141209-0049 MASTER MASTER GET UP QUICK HERE IS A FIGHT GOING TO BEGIN I SPRANG UP AND SNATCHING MY REVOLVER BELT FROM THE GUN STAND WALKED OUTSIDE
2039-141209-0050 BETWEEN A NOISY VINDICTIVE LOOKING SET OF NATIVES OF THE ONE PART AND OUR PEOPLE OF THE OTHER PART SEVEN OR EIGHT OF OUR PEOPLE HAD TAKEN REFUGE BEHIND THE CANOE AND HAD THEIR LOADED GUNS HALF POINTING AT THE PASSIONATE MOB WHICH WAS MOMENTARILY INCREASING IN NUMBERS
2039-141209-0051 YOU BOMBAY SEND TWO MEN OFF TO WARN THE DOCTOR AND TELL HIM TO HURRY UP HERE BUT JUST AT THIS PERIOD THE DOCTOR AND HIS TWO MEN APPEARED ON THE BROW OF THE HILL LOOKING DOWN IN A MOST COMPLACENT MANNER UPON THE SERIO COMIC SCENE
2039-141209-0052 HIS FATHER THE SULTAN WAS AS INEBRIATED AS HIMSELF THOUGH NOT QUITE SO VIOLENT IN HIS BEHAVIOUR IN THE MEANTIME THE DOCTOR ARRIVED UPON THE SCENE AND SELIM HAD SLIPPED MY WINCHESTER RIFLE WITH THE MAGAZINE FULL OF CARTRIDGES INTO MY HAND
2039-141209-0053 THE DOCTOR CALMLY ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER
2039-141209-0054 THAT THE PEOPLE WISHED US TO LEAVE AS THEY WERE ON HOSTILE TERMS WITH THE ARABS BECAUSE THE ELDEST SON OF THE SULTAN OF MUZIMU THE LARGE ISLAND NEARLY OPPOSITE
2039-141209-0055 AFTER CONSULTING WITH THE GUIDES THE DOCTOR AND I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WERE BETTER THAT WE SHOULD ENDEAVOUR TO PACIFY THE SULTAN BY A PRESENT
2039-141209-0056 IN HIS INSANE FURY HE HAD ATTEMPTED TO SLASH AT ONE OF MY MEN WITH A BILLHOOK HE CARRIED THIS HAD BEEN TAKEN AS A DECLARATION OF HOSTILITIES AND THE SOLDIERS WERE READY ENOUGH TO ENGAGE IN WAR BUT THERE WAS NO NECESSITY TO COMMENCE FIGHTING WITH A DRUNKEN MOB
2039-141209-0057 WHO COULD HAVE BEEN CLEARED OFF THE GROUND WITH OUR REVOLVERS ALONE HAD WE DESIRED IT THE DOCTOR BARING HIS ARM SAID TO THEM THAT HE WAS NOT A MGWANA OR AN ARAB BUT A WHITE MAN THAT ARABS
2039-141209-0058 HAD NO SUCH COLOUR AS WE HAD WE WERE WHITE MEN DIFFERENT PEOPLE ALTOGETHER FROM THOSE WHOM THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO SEE
2039-141209-0059 AND THEIR LOUD PROTESTATIONS AGAINST ARAB CRUELTY WERE ABOUT TO SUBSIDE WHEN THE OLD SULTAN SUDDENLY ROSE UP AND BEGAN TO PACE ABOUT IN AN EXCITED MANNER AND IN ONE OF HIS PERAMBULATIONS DELIBERATELY SLASHED HIS LEG
2039-141209-0060 THEN EXCLAIMED THAT THE WANGWANA HAD WOUNDED HIM AT THIS CRY ONE HALF OF THE MOB HASTILY TOOK TO FLIGHT BUT ONE OLD WOMAN WHO CARRIED A STRONG STAFF WITH A CARVED LIZARD'S BODY ON ITS TOP COMMENCED TO ABUSE THE CHIEF WITH ALL THE POWER OF HER VOLUBLE TONGUE
2039-141209-0061 CHARGING HIM WITH A DESIRE TO HAVE THEM ALL KILLED
2039-141209-0062 BUT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THERE WAS LITTLE NEEDED TO CAUSE ALL MEN PRESENT IN THAT LITTLE HOLLOW TO BEGIN A MOST SANGUINARY STRIFE THE GENTLE PATIENT BEARING OF THE DOCTOR HAD MORE EFFECT THAN ANYTHING ELSE
2039-141209-0063 IN MAKING ALL FORBEAR BLOODSHED WHILE THERE WAS LEFT THE LEAST CHANCE OF AN AMICABLE SETTLEMENT AND IN THE END IT PREVAILED THE SULTAN AND HIS SON WERE BOTH SENT ON THEIR WAY REJOICING WHILE THE DOCTOR CONVERSED WITH THEM AND ENDEAVOURED TO CALM THEIR FIERCE PASSIONS
2039-141209-0064 BESIDES SAID I THERE ARE TWO OR THREE COWARDLY CREATURES IN THE BOAT WHO IN CASE OF ANOTHER DISTURBANCE WOULD NOT SCRUPLE TO LEAVE BOTH OF US HERE FROM CAPE LUVUMBA
2039-141209-0065 AT EIGHT P M WE WERE ABREAST OF CAPE PANZA THE NORTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE ISLAND OF MUZIMU AT SIX A M WE WERE SOUTHWARD OF BIKARI AND PULLING FOR MUKUNGU IN URUNDI AT WHICH PLACE WE ARRIVED AT TEN A M
2039-141209-0066 HAVING BEEN SEVENTEEN HOURS AND A HALF IN CROSSING THE LAKE WHICH COMPUTING AT TWO MILES AN HOUR MAY BE SAID TO BE THIRTY FIVE MILES DIRECT BREADTH
2039-141209-0067 AS WE WERE SHORT OF POWDER AND BALL AS WE LANDED OUR SOLDIERS AND THE ARAB MAGNATES CAME TO THE WATER'S EDGE TO GREET US MABRUKI HAD A RICH BUDGET TO RELATE TO US OF WHAT HAD OCCURRED DURING OUR ABSENCE THIS FAITHFUL MAN LEFT BEHIND IN CHARGE OF LIVINGSTONE'S HOUSE
2039-141209-0068 HAD DONE MOST EXCELLENTLY KALULU HAD SCALDED HIMSELF AND HAD A FRIGHTFUL RAW SORE ON HIS CHEST IN CONSEQUENCE MABRUKI HAD LOCKED UP MARORA IN CHAINS FOR WOUNDING ONE OF THE ASSES
2039-141209-0069 BILALI THE STUTTERING COWARD A BULLY OF WOMEN HAD CAUSED A TUMULT IN THE MARKET PLACE AND HAD BEEN SHARPLY BELABOURED WITH THE STICK BY MABRUKI AND ABOVE ALL MOST WELCOME WAS A LETTER I RECEIVED FROM THE AMERICAN CONSUL AT ZANZIBAR
2039-141209-0070 DATED JUNE ELEVENTH CONTAINING TELEGRAMS FROM PARIS AS LATE AS APRIL TWENTY SECOND OF THE SAME YEAR POOR LIVINGSTONE EXCLAIMED AND I HAVE NONE WHAT A PLEASANT THING IT IS TO HAVE A REAL AND GOOD FRIEND
