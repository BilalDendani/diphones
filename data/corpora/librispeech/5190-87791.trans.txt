5190-87791-0000 DEFENDS DIVORCE AS A PROTECTION TO MONOGAMOUS LOVE AND ONE OF THE MEANS OF PREVENTING INFIDELITY AND PROSTITUTION YOU WILL HEAR SERMONS AND READ NEWSPAPER EDITORIALS ABOUT THE DIVORCE EVIL
5190-87791-0001 AND YOU WILL FIND THAT TO THE PREACHER OR EDITOR THIS EVIL CONSISTS OF THE FACT THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE REFUSING TO STAY UNHAPPILY MARRIED IT DOES NOT INTEREST THESE MORALIZERS IF THE STATISTICS SHOW
5190-87791-0002 THAT IT IS WOMEN WHO ARE GETTING MOST OF THE DIVORCES AND THAT THE MEANING OF THE PHENOMENON IS THAT WOMEN ARE REFUSING TO CONTINUE LIVING WITH DRUNKEN AND DISSOLUTE MEN TO THE CLERGY THE BREAKING OF A MARRIAGE
5190-87791-0003 IS AN EVIL PER SE AND REGARDLESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES THEY KNOW THIS BECAUSE GOD HAS TOLD THEM SO AND IN THE NAME OF GOD THEY SEEK TO KEEP PEOPLE TIED IN SEX UNIONS
5190-87791-0004 WHICH HAVE COME TO MEAN LOATHING INSTEAD OF LOVE NOW I WILL ASSERT IT AS A MATHEMATICAL CERTAINTY THAT A CONSIDERABLE PERCENTAGE OF MARRIAGES MUST FAIL IT IS ESSENTIAL TO PROGRESS
5190-87791-0005 THAT HUMAN BEINGS SHOULD GROW BOTH MENTALLY AND SPIRITUALLY AND MANIFESTLY THEY CANNOT ALL GROW IN THE SAME WAY IF THEY GROW DIFFERENTLY
5190-87791-0006 MUST THEY NOT SOMETIMES LOSE THE POWER TO MAKE EACH OTHER HAPPY IN THE MARITAL BONDS WHO DOES NOT KNOW THE MAN WHO MASTERS LIFE AND BECOMES A VITAL FORCE WHILE HIS WIFE REMAINS DULL AND EMPTY
5190-87791-0007 IF SUCH A MAN CHANGES WIVES THE WORLD IN GENERAL DENOUNCES HIM AS A SELFISH BEAST BUT THE WORLD DOES NOT KNOW NOR DOES IT CARE ABOUT THOSE THOUSANDS OF MEN WHO NOT CARING TO BE BRANDED AS SELFISH BEASTS
5190-87791-0008 FULFILL THE NEEDS OF THEIR LIVES BY KEEPING MISTRESSES IN SECRET I KNEW A CERTAIN COUNTRY SCHOOL TEACHER ONE OF THE MOST NARROWLY CONVENTIONAL YOUNG WOMEN IMAGINABLE WHO WAS ENGAGED TO A MIDDLE AGED BUSINESS MAN
5190-87791-0009 AND WROTE HER THAT HE HAD MET SOME ANARCHISTS AND HAD DISCOVERED THAT ALL HE HAD READ ABOUT THEM IN THE NEWSPAPERS WAS FALSE AND THAT THEY WERE THE TRUE AND PURE IDEALISTS
5190-87791-0010 THE YOUNG LADY WAS HORRIFIED NOR WAS SHE ANY HAPPIER WHEN SHE CAME TO NEW YORK AND MET HER FIANCE'S NEW FRIENDS SHE OUGHT IN COMMON SENSE TO HAVE BROKEN THE ENGAGEMENT BUT SHE WAS IN LOVE AND
5190-87791-0011 A CONSERVATIVE CAPITALIST OF NARROW AND AGGRESSIVE TEMPER WHOSE WIFE TURNED INTO AN ARDENT BOLSHEVIK THE MAN THINKS THAT ALL BOLSHEVIKS SHOULD BE SHUT UP IN JAIL FOR LIFE WHILE THE WIFE IS EQUALLY CERTAIN THAT ALL JAILS SHOULD BE RAZED TO THE GROUND
5190-87791-0012 AND ALL BOLSHEVIKS PLACED IN CONTROL OF THE GOVERNMENT THESE TWO PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO A POINT WHERE THEY CANNOT SIT DOWN TO THE BREAKFAST TABLE WITHOUT FLYING INTO A QUARREL I KNOW ANOTHER CASE OF A MODERN SCIENTIST
5190-87791-0013 AN AGNOSTIC WHOSE WIFE A HALF EDUCATED SENTIMENTAL WOMAN TOOK TO DABBLING IN MYSTICISM
5190-87791-0014 IN HER BEDROOM AND CONSORTING WITH SWAMIS IN LONG YELLOW ROBES
5190-87791-0015 AND TURNED OVER THE CARE OF HIS DOMESTIC LIFE TO A PRIEST IS IT NOT OBVIOUS THAT THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF SUCH PROBLEMS LIES IN DIVORCE UNLESS INDEED
5190-87791-0016 WE ARE ALL OF US GOING TO TURN OVER THE CARE OF OUR DOMESTIC LIVES TO THE PRIESTS OUR GRANDFATHERS AND GRANDMOTHERS BELIEVED ONE THING AND BELIEVED THE SAME THING WHEN THEY WERE SEVENTY AS WHEN THEY WERE TWENTY
5190-87791-0017 SO IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO DWELL IN DOMESTIC SECURITY AND PERMANENCE TILL DEATH DID THEM PART BUT WE ARE LEARNING TO CHANGE OUR MINDS AND WHETHER WHAT WE BELIEVE IS BETTER OR WORSE THAN WHAT OUR ANCESTORS BELIEVED
5190-87791-0018 THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE MEANS MORE AND MORE TO US AND IT BECOMES HARDER AND HARDER FOR US TO FIND SEXUAL AND DOMESTIC HAPPINESS WITH A PARTNER WHO DOES NOT SHARE OUR CONVICTIONS BUT ON THE CONTRARY
5190-87791-0019 MAY BE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CAMPAIGN FUNDS OF THE OPPOSITION PARTY I DO NOT MEAN BY THIS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD GET A DIVORCE AS SOON AS THEY FIND THEY DIFFER ABOUT SOME INTELLECTUAL IDEA ON THE CONTRARY
5190-87791-0020 I HAVE ADVOCATED THAT THEY SHOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND AND TO TOLERATE EACH OTHER BUT IT IS A FACT
5190-87791-0021 AND LIVES ARE MADE AND IT IS INEVITABLE THAT SOME CHARACTERS AND LIVES THAT FIT QUITE WELL AT TWENTY SHOULD FIT VERY BADLY AT THIRTY OR FORTY
5190-87791-0022 WE ARE NOT FOSTERING MARRIAGE AS WE FONDLY IMAGINE WE ARE REALLY FOSTERING ADULTERY IT IS A FACT THAT NOT ONE PERSON IN TEN WHO IS HELD BY LEGAL OR SOCIAL FORCE IN AN UNHAPPY SEX UNION
5190-87791-0023 DIVORCE LAWS SUCH AS THE CLERICAL PROPAGANDA URGES UPON US
5190-87791-0024 FOR THE PROMOTION OF FORNICATION AND PROSTITUTION THERE IS A SHORT STORY BY EDITH WHARTON IN WHICH THE DIVORCE EVIL
5190-87791-0025 THE STORY CALLED THE OTHER TWO IN THE VOLUME THE DESCENT OF MAN A SOCIETY WOMAN HAS BEEN DIVORCED TWICE AND MARRIED THREE TIMES AND BY AN INGENIOUS SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES
5190-87791-0026 ALL COMPELLED TO MEET TOGETHER AND THINK OF SOMETHING TO SAY I CITE THIS STORY BECAUSE IT IS A PERFECT ILLUSTRATION OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE DIVORCE PROBLEM IS A PROBLEM OF OUR LACK OF SENSE
5190-87791-0027 MISSUS WHARTON WILL I FEAR CONSIDER ME A VERY VULGAR PERSON IF I ASSERT THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHATEVER WHY ANY OF THOSE FOUR PEOPLE IN HER STORY SHOULD HAVE HAD A MOMENT'S DISCOMFORT OF MIND
5190-87791-0028 EXCEPT THAT THEY THOUGHT THERE WAS THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO PREVENT A MAN AND WOMAN WHO USED TO BE MARRIED FROM MEETING SOCIALLY AND BEING DECENT TO EACH OTHER OR TO PREVENT TWO MEN FROM BEING DECENT TO EACH OTHER UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
5190-87791-0029 I WOULD NOT SAY THAT THEY SHOULD CHOOSE TO BE INTIMATE FRIENDS THOUGH EVEN THAT MAY BE POSSIBLE OCCASIONALLY I KNOW BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN IT HAPPEN IN HOLLAND
5190-87791-0030 AND AFTER A FEW DAYS HE REMARKED THAT HE WOULD LIKE ME TO MEET THE MOTHER OF THESE YOUNG MEN WE WENT FOR A WALK OF A MILE OR SO AND MET A LADY WHO LIVED IN A SMALL HOUSE BY HERSELF AND WHO RECEIVED US WITH A FRIENDLY WELCOME
5190-87791-0031 AND TALKED WITH US FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS ABOUT MUSIC AND BOOKS AND ART THIS LADY HAD BEEN THE WRITER'S WIFE FOR TEN YEARS OR SO AND THERE HAD BEEN A TERRIBLE UPROAR WHEN THEY VOLUNTARILY PARTED BUT
5190-87791-0032 THEY HAD REFUSED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THIS UPROAR THEY UNDERSTOOD WHY THEY DID NOT WISH TO REMAIN HUSBAND AND WIFE ANY LONGER BUT THEY DID NOT CONSIDER IT NECESSARY TO QUARREL ABOUT IT NOR EVEN TO BREAK OFF THE FRIENDSHIP WHICH THEIR COMMON INTERESTS MADE POSSIBLE
5190-87791-0033 THE TWO WOMEN IN THE CASE WERE NOT INTIMATE I GATHERED BUT THEY FREQUENTLY MET AT THE HOMES OF OTHERS
5190-87791-0034 HAS THE RIGHT TO FORBID DIVORCE OR TO IMPOSE LIMITATIONS UPON IT WE HAVE QUOTED THE OLD MAXIM MARRY IN HASTE AND REPENT AT LEISURE
5190-87791-0035 AND WE SUGGESTED THAT PARENTS AND GUARDIANS SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK THE YOUNG TO WAIT BEFORE MARRIAGE AND MAKE CERTAIN OF THE STATE OF THEIR HEARTS WE HAVE NOW THE SAME ADVICE TO GIVE CONCERNING DIVORCE
5190-87791-0036 THE SAME CLAIM TO ENTER ON BEHALF OF SOCIETY THAT IT HAS AND SHOULD ASSERT THE RIGHT TO ASK PEOPLE TO DELAY AND THINK CAREFULLY BEFORE BREAKING UP A MARRIAGE
5190-87791-0037 WHAT INTEREST HAS SOCIETY IN THE RESTRICTION OF DIVORCE WHAT AFFAIR IS IT OF ANY OTHER PERSON IF I CHOOSE TO GET A DIVORCE AND MARRY A NEW WIFE ONCE A MONTH THERE ARE MANY REASONS
5190-87791-0038 NOT IN ANY WAY BASED UPON RELIGIOUS SUPERSTITION OR CONVENTIONAL PREJUDICE IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE ARE OR MAY BE CHILDREN AND SOCIETY SHOULD TRY TO PRESERVE FOR EVERY CHILD A HOME WITH A FATHER AND A MOTHER IN IT
5190-87791-0039 SECOND THERE ARE PROPERTY RIGHTS OF WHICH EVERY MARRIAGE IS A TANGLE AND THE SETTLEMENT OF WHICH THE LAW SHOULD ALWAYS OVERSEE THIRD
5190-87791-0040 THERE IS THE QUESTION OF VENEREAL DISEASE WHICH SOCIETY HAS AN UNQUESTIONABLE RIGHT TO KEEP DOWN BY EVERY REASONABLE RESTRICTION UPON SEXUAL PROMISCUITY AND FINALLY THERE IS THE RESPECT
5190-87791-0041 WHICH ALL MEN AND WOMEN OWE TO LOVE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SOCIETY HAS THE SAME RIGHT TO PROTECT LOVE AGAINST EXTREME OUTRAGE AS IT HAS TO FORBID INDECENT EXPOSURE OF THE PERSON ON THE STREET
5190-87791-0042 THERE IS IN SUCCESSFUL OPERATION IN SWITZERLAND A WISE AND SANE DIVORCE LAW BASED UPON COMMON SENSE AND NOT UPON SUPERSTITION A COUPLE WISH TO BREAK THEIR MARRIAGE AND THEY GO BEFORE A JUDGE
5190-87791-0043 AND IN PRIVATE SESSION AS TO A FRIENDLY ADVISER THEY TELL THEIR TROUBLES HE GIVES THEM ADVICE ABOUT THEIR DISAGREEMENT AND SENDS THEM AWAY FOR THREE MONTHS TO THINK IT OVER AT THE END OF THREE MONTHS
5190-87791-0044 IF HE STILL THINKS THERE IS A CHANCE OF RECONCILIATION HE HAS THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE THEM TO WAIT ANOTHER THREE MONTHS BUT IF AT THE END OF THIS SECOND PERIOD THEY ARE STILL CONVINCED THAT THE CASE IS HOPELESS AND THAT THEY SHOULD PART
5190-87791-0045 THE JUDGE IS REQUIRED TO GRANT THE DIVORCE YOU MAY NOTE THAT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE SUGGESTED CONCERNING YOUNG COUPLES WHO BECOME ENGAGED IN BOTH CASES THE PARTIES DIRECTLY INTERESTED
5190-87791-0046 HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE THEIR OWN FATE BUT THE REST OF THE WORLD REQUIRES THEM TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT IT AND TO LISTEN TO COUNSEL EXCEPT FOR GRAVE OFFENSES SUCH AS ADULTERY INSANITY CRIME OR VENEREAL DISEASE
5190-87791-0047 I DO NOT THINK THAT ANYONE SHOULD RECEIVE A DIVORCE IN LESS THAN SIX MONTHS NOR DO I THINK THAT ANY PERSONAL RIGHT IS CONTRAVENED BY THE IMPOSING OF SUCH A DELAY NEXT
5190-87791-0048 WHAT ARE WE GOING TO SAY TO THE RIGHT OR THE CLAIM TO THE RIGHT ON THE PART OF A MAN OR WOMAN TO BE MARRIED ONCE A YEAR THROUGHOUT A LIFETIME IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE THIS PROBLEM I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT A CERTAIN MAN KNOWN TO ME
5190-87791-0049 IN HIS EARLY LIFE HE SPENT A COUPLE OF YEARS IN A LUNATIC ASYLUM HE LAYS CLAIM TO EXTRAORDINARY SPIRITUAL GIFTS AND USES THE LANGUAGE OF THE HIGHEST IDEALISM KNOWN HE IS A MAN OF CULTURE AND GOOD FAMILY
5190-87791-0050 AND THUS EXERTS A PECULIAR CHARM UPON YOUNG WOMEN OF REFINEMENT AND SENSITIVENESS TO MY KNOWLEDGE HE WAS THREE TIMES MARRIED IN SIX YEARS AND EACH TIME HE DESERTED THE WOMAN
5190-87791-0051 FOR TEN YEARS OR SO I USED TO SEE HIM ABOUT ONCE IN SIX MONTHS AND INVARIABLY HE HAD A NEW WOMAN A YOUNG GIRL OF FINE CHARACTER WHO HAD BEEN ENSNARED BY HIM AND WAS IN THE AGONIZING PROCESS
5190-87791-0052 OF DISCOVERING HIS MORAL AND MENTAL DERANGEMENT YET THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN THE LAW TO PLACE RESTRAINT UPON THIS MAN HE COULD WANDER FROM STATE TO STATE OR TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD PREYING UPON LOVELY YOUNG GIRLS WHEREVER HE WENT
5190-87791-0053 THIS PARTICULAR MAN HAPPENS TO CALL HIMSELF A RADICAL BUT I COULD TELL YOU OF SIMILAR MEN IN THE HIGHEST SOCIAL CIRCLES OR IN THE POLITICAL WORLD THE THEATRICAL WORLD THE SPORTING WORLD
5190-87791-0054 THEY ARE IN EVERY RANK OF LIFE AND ARE JUST AS DEFINITELY AND CERTAINLY MENACES TO HUMAN WELFARE AND PROGRESS AS PIRATES ON THE HIGH SEAS OR HIGHWAYMEN ON THE ROAD NOR ARE THEY CONFINED TO THE MALES
5190-87791-0055 BUT I THINK WE MIGHT BEGIN BY REFUSING TO LET ANY MAN OR WOMAN HAVE MORE THAN TWO DIVORCES IN ONE LIFETIME IN ANY STATE OR PART OF THE WORLD
5190-87791-0056 IF ANY MAN OR WOMAN TRIES THREE TIMES TO FIND HAPPINESS IN LOVE AND FAILS EACH TIME WE HAVE A RIGHT TO ASSUME THAT THE FAULT MUST LIE WITH THAT PERSON AND NOT WITH THE THREE PARTNERS
5190-87791-0057 THE GREAT MASS OF THE PUBLIC HAS SYMPATHY FOR THE LAW BREAKER JUST AS IN OLD DAYS THE PEASANTS COULD NOT HELP ADMIRING THE OUTLAW WHO RESISTED UNJUST LAND LAWS AND ROBBED THE RICH
5190-87791-0058 OR AS TODAY UNDER THE CAPITALIST REGIME WE CAN NOT WITHHOLD OUR SYMPATHY FROM POLITICAL PRISONERS EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE COMMITTED ACTS OF VIOLENCE WHICH WE DEPLORE BUT WHEN WE HAVE MADE SEX LAWS
5190-87791-0059 THAT WE KNOW ARE JUST AND SENSIBLE THEN WE SHALL CONSIDER THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO RESTRAIN SEX CRIMINALS AND IN EXTREME CASES WE SHALL AVAIL OURSELVES OF THE SKILL OF SCIENCE TO PERFORM A SURGICAL OPERATION
5190-87791-0060 TO PREY UPON THE LOVE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PLACED AT HIS MERCY BY THEIR BEST QUALITIES THEIR UNSELFISHNESS AND LACK OF SUSPICION WE CLEAR OUT FOUL SMELLING WEEDS FROM OUR GARDEN
5190-87791-0061 BECAUSE WE WISH TO RAISE BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS AND USEFUL HERBS THEREIN THERE LIVES IN CALIFORNIA A STUDENT OF PLANT LIFE WHO HAS SHOWN US WHAT WE CAN DO NOT BY MAGIC OR BY SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS
5190-87791-0062 BUT SIMPLY BY LOVING PLANTS BY WATCHING THEM CEASELESSLY UNDERSTANDING THEIR WAYS AND GUIDING THEIR SEX LIFE TO OUR OWN PURPOSES WE CAN PERFORM
5190-87791-0063 WHAT TO OUR IGNORANT ANCESTORS WOULD HAVE SEEMED TO BE MIRACLES WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE ALL SORTS OF NEW PLANTS WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO BREED THEIR OWN KIND AND SURVIVE FOREVER IF WE GIVE THEM PROPER CARE IN OTHER WORDS LUTHER BURBANK
5190-87791-0064 HAS SHOWN US THAT WE CAN CHANGE PLANT NATURE THERE FLASH BACK UPON MY MEMORY ALL THOSE DULL WEARY SICK HUMAN CREATURES WHO HAVE REPEATED TO ME THAT DULL WEARY SICK OLD FORMULA
5190-87791-0065 YOU CANNOT CHANGE HUMAN NATURE I DO NOT THINK I AM INDULGING EITHER IN RELIGIOUS SUPERSTITION OR IN BLIND OPTIMISM BUT AM SPEAKING PRECISELY
5190-87791-0066 IN SAYING THAT WHENEVER HUMAN BEINGS GET READY TO APPLY EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE TO THEMSELVES THEY CAN CHANGE HUMAN NATURE JUST AS THEY NOW CHANGE PLANT NATURE BY PUTTING HUMAN BODIES TOGETHER IN LOVE
5190-87791-0067 WE MAKE NEW BODIES OF CHILDREN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANY WHO HAVE YET ROMPED ON THE EARTH AND IN THE SAME WAY BY PUTTING MINDS AND SOULS TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE NEW KINDS OF MINDS AND SOULS
5190-87791-0068 DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AND GREATER THAN EITHER THE MAN SOUL OR THE WOMAN SOUL ALONE ALSO BY THAT MAGIC WHICH IS THE LAW OF MIND AND SOUL LIFE
5190-87791-0069 EACH NEW CREATION CAN BE MULTIPLIED TO INFINITY AND SHARED BY ALL OTHER MINDS AND SOULS THAT LIVE IN THE PRESENT OR MAY LIVE IN THE FUTURE WE HAVE SHOWN ELSEWHERE
5190-87791-0070 HOW GENIUS MULTIPLIES TO INFINITY THE JOY AND POWER OF LIFE BY MEANS OF THE ARTS AND ONE OF THE GREATEST OF THE ARTS IS THE ART OF LOVE CONSIDER THE GREAT LOVERS THE TRUE LOVERS OF HISTORY
5190-87791-0071 FROM ROBERT AND ELIZABETH BROWNING FROM TRISTAN AND ISOLDE FROM ROMEO AND JULIET WHAT IS THE DEPTH AND THE SPLENDOR OF THIS PASSION WHICH LIES HIDDEN WITHIN US
