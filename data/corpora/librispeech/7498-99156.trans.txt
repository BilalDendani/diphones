7498-99156-0000 SEVENTEEN FIFTY LETTERS
7498-99156-0001 IN A LETTER TO ONE OF HIS FRIENDS WRITTEN SOON AFTER THIS HE DESCRIBES HER AS MISTRESS OF THE FRENCH ENGLISH AND ITALIAN LANGUAGES AND EVEN CONVERSANT WITH GREEK AND LATIN LITERATURE SHE WAS THEN IN HER TWENTY FOURTH YEAR
7498-99156-0002 HE IN HIS TWENTY SEVENTH THEIR MARRIAGE TOOK PLACE ABOUT THREE YEARS AFTERWARDS HERE IS META'S OWN NARRATIVE OF THE RISE AND COURSE OF THEIR TRUE LOVE GIVEN IN ONE OF HER LETTERS TO RICHARDSON A NARRATIVE WHICH WILL BEAR A HUNDRED READINGS AND A HUNDRED MORE AFTER THAT
7498-99156-0003 AND STILL BE AS FRESH AND AS TOUCHING AS EVER YOU WILL KNOW ALL WHAT CONCERNS ME LOVE DEAR SIR IS ALL WHAT ME CONCERNS AND LOVE SHALL BE ALL WHAT I WILL TELL YOU IN THIS LETTER IN ONE HAPPY NIGHT I READ MY HUSBAND'S POEM THE MESSIAH
7498-99156-0004 I WAS EXTREMELY TOUCHED WITH IT THE NEXT DAY I ASKED ONE OF HIS FRIENDS WHO WAS THE AUTHOR OF THIS POEM AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I HEARD KLOPSTOCK'S NAME I BELIEVE I FELL IMMEDIATELY IN LOVE WITH HIM
7498-99156-0005 AT THE LEAST MY THOUGHTS WERE EVER WITH HIM FILLED ESPECIALLY BECAUSE HIS FRIEND TOLD ME VERY MUCH OF HIS CHARACTER BUT I HAD NO HOPES EVER TO SEE HIM WHEN QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY I HEARD THAT HE SHOULD PASS THROUGH HAMBURG
7498-99156-0006 I WROTE IMMEDIATELY TO THE SAME FRIEND FOR PROCURING BY HIS MEANS THAT I MIGHT SEE THE AUTHOR OF THE MESSIAH WHEN IN HAMBURG HE TOLD HIM THAT A CERTAIN GIRL IN HAMBURG WISHED TO SEE HIM
7498-99156-0007 AND FOR ALL RECOMMENDATION SHOWED HIM SOME LETTERS IN WHICH I MADE BOLD TO CRITICISE KLOPSTOCK'S VERSES KLOPSTOCK CAME AND CAME TO ME I MUST CONFESS THAT THOUGH GREATLY PREPOSSESSED OF HIS QUALITIES I NEVER THOUGHT HIM THE AMIABLE YOUTH WHOM I FOUND HIM
7498-99156-0008 THIS MADE ITS EFFECT AFTER HAVING SEEN HIM FOR TWO HOURS I WAS OBLIGED TO PASS THE EVENING IN A COMPANY WHICH NEVER HAD BEEN SO WEARISOME TO ME I COULD NOT SPEAK I COULD NOT PLAY I THOUGHT I SAW NOTHING BUT KLOPSTOCK
7498-99156-0009 I SAW HIM THE NEXT DAY AND THE FOLLOWING AND WE WERE VERY SERIOUSLY FRIENDS BUT THE FOURTH DAY HE DEPARTED HE WROTE SOON AFTER AND FROM THAT TIME OUR CORRESPONDENCE BEGAN TO BE A VERY DILIGENT ONE
7498-99156-0010 I SINCERELY BELIEVED MY LOVE TO BE FRIENDSHIP I SPOKE TO MY FRIENDS OF NOTHING BUT KLOPSTOCK AND SHOWED HIS LETTERS THEY RALLIED ME AND SAID I WAS IN LOVE
7498-99156-0011 I RALLIED THEM AGAIN AND SAID THAT THEY MUST HAVE A VERY FRIENDSHIPLESS HEART IF THEY HAD NO IDEA OF FRIENDSHIP TO A MAN AS WELL AS TO A WOMAN THUS IT CONTINUED EIGHT MONTHS IN WHICH TIME MY FRIENDS FOUND AS MUCH LOVE IN KLOPSTOCK'S LETTERS AS IN MINE
7498-99156-0012 I PERCEIVED IT LIKEWISE BUT I WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT AT THE LAST KLOPSTOCK SAID PLAINLY THAT HE LOVED AND I STARTLED AS FOR A WRONG THING I ANSWERED THAT IT WAS NO LOVE BUT FRIENDSHIP AS IT WAS WHAT I FELT FOR HIM
7498-99156-0013 WE HAD NOT SEEN ONE ANOTHER ENOUGH TO LOVE AS IF LOVE MUST HAVE MORE TIME THAN FRIENDSHIP THIS WAS SINCERELY MY MEANING AND I HAD THIS MEANING TILL KLOPSTOCK CAME AGAIN TO HAMBURG THIS HE DID A YEAR AFTER WE HAD SEEN ONE ANOTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME
7498-99156-0014 WE SAW WE WERE FRIENDS WE LOVED AND WE BELIEVED THAT WE LOVED AND A SHORT TIME AFTER I COULD EVEN TELL KLOPSTOCK THAT I LOVED BUT WE WERE OBLIGED TO PART AGAIN AND WAIT TWO YEARS FOR OUR WEDDING
7498-99156-0015 I COULD MARRY THEN WITHOUT HER CONSENTMENT AS BY THE DEATH OF MY FATHER MY FORTUNE DEPENDED NOT UPON HER BUT THIS WAS AN HORRIBLE IDEA FOR ME AND THANK HEAVEN I HAVE PREVAILED BY PRAYERS
7498-99156-0016 AT THIS TIME KNOWING KLOPSTOCK SHE LOVES HIM AS HER LIFELY SON AND THANKS GOD THAT SHE HAS NOT PERSISTED WE MARRIED AND I AM THE HAPPIEST WIFE IN THE WORLD THIS WAS WRITTEN IN MARCH SEVENTEEN FIFTY EIGHT
7498-99156-0017 AFTER THEY HAD BEEN ABOUT FOUR YEARS MARRIED WRITING AGAIN IN THE BEGINNING OF MAY SHE THUS SKETCHES THE LIFE THEY LED TOGETHER IT WILL BE A DELIGHTFUL OCCUPATION FOR ME TO MAKE YOU MORE ACQUAINTED WITH MY HUSBAND'S POEM
7498-99156-0018 NOBODY CAN DO IT BETTER THAN I BEING THE PERSON WHO KNOWS THE MOST OF THAT WHICH IS NOT YET PUBLISHED BEING ALWAYS PRESENT AT THE BIRTH OF THE YOUNG VERSES WHICH BEGIN ALWAYS BY FRAGMENTS HERE AND THERE OF A SUBJECT OF WHICH HIS SOUL IS JUST THEN FILLED
7498-99156-0019 HE HAS MANY GREAT FRAGMENTS OF THE WHOLE WORK READY YOU MAY THINK THAT PERSONS WHO LOVE AS WE DO HAVE NO NEED OF TWO CHAMBERS WE ARE ALWAYS IN THE SAME
7498-99156-0020 I WITH MY LITTLE WORK STILL ONLY REGARDING SOMETIMES MY HUSBAND'S SWEET FACE WHICH IS SO VENERABLE AT THAT TIME WITH TEARS OF DEVOTION AND ALL THE SUBLIMITY OF THE SUBJECT MY HUSBAND READING ME THE YOUNG VERSES AND SUFFERING MY CRITICISM
7498-99156-0021 WITH THIS WE MAY COMPARE WHAT KLOPSTOCK SAYS WRITING OF HER HOW PERFECT WAS HER TASTE HOW EXQUISITELY FINE HER FEELINGS SHE OBSERVED EVERYTHING EVEN TO THE SLIGHTEST TURN OF THE THOUGHT I HAD ONLY TO LOOK AT HER
7498-99156-0022 AND COULD SEE IN HER FACE WHEN EVEN A SYLLABLE PLEASED OR DISPLEASED HER AND WHEN I LED HER TO EXPLAIN THE REASON OF HER REMARKS NO DEMONSTRATION COULD BE MORE TRUE MORE ACCURATE OR MORE APPROPRIATE TO THE SUBJECT BUT
7498-99156-0023 IN GENERAL THIS GAVE US VERY LITTLE TROUBLE FOR WE UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER WHEN WE HAD SCARCELY BEGAN TO EXPLAIN OUR IDEAS BUT ALL THIS HAPPINESS TOO BRIGHT FOR EARTH OR FOR LONG ENDURANCE WAS ABOUT TO BE SUDDENLY EXTINGUISHED

7498-99156-0025 WHILE HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO MAKE A JOURNEY TO COPENHAGEN IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY HAD BEEN SEPARATED IT IS REMARKABLE THAT SHE SEEMS TO HAVE HAD MORE THAN A MERE APPREHENSION ALMOST AN ASSURED FOREBODING OF WHAT AWAITED HER
