2758-161217-0000 WERE THREE FEMALE DIVINITIES DAUGHTERS OF THAUMAS AND ELECTRA
2758-161217-0001 THEY WERE REPRESENTED WITH THE HEAD OF A FAIR HAIRED MAIDEN AND THE BODY OF A VULTURE AND WERE PERPETUALLY DEVOURED BY THE PANGS OF INSATIABLE HUNGER WHICH CAUSED THEM TO TORMENT THEIR VICTIMS BY ROBBING THEM OF THEIR FOOD
2758-161217-0002 THEIR WONDERFULLY RAPID FLIGHT FAR SURPASSED THAT OF BIRDS OR EVEN OF THE WINDS THEMSELVES IF ANY MORTAL SUDDENLY AND UNACCOUNTABLY DISAPPEARED THE HARPIES WERE BELIEVED TO HAVE CARRIED HIM OFF
2758-161217-0003 TO ACT AS SERVANTS TO THE ERINYES THE HARPIES WOULD APPEAR TO BE PERSONIFICATIONS OF SUDDEN TEMPESTS WHICH WITH RUTHLESS VIOLENCE SWEEP OVER WHOLE DISTRICTS CARRYING OFF OR INJURING ALL BEFORE THEM
2758-161217-0004 WHO PERSONIFIED THE TORTURING PANGS OF AN EVIL CONSCIENCE AND THE REMORSE WHICH INEVITABLY FOLLOWS WRONG DOING
2758-161217-0005 AND THEIR ORIGIN WAS VARIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR ACCORDING TO HESIOD THEY SPRANG FROM THE BLOOD OF URANUS WHEN WOUNDED BY CRONUS
2758-161217-0006 AND WERE HENCE SUPPOSED TO BE THE EMBODIMENT OF ALL THE TERRIBLE IMPRECATIONS WHICH THE DEFEATED DEITY CALLED DOWN UPON THE HEAD OF HIS REBELLIOUS SON ACCORDING TO OTHER ACCOUNTS THEY WERE THE DAUGHTERS OF NIGHT
2758-161217-0007 FOR THEY APPEARED UPON EARTH AS THE AVENGING DEITIES WHO RELENTLESSLY PURSUED AND PUNISHED MURDERERS PERJURERS THOSE WHO HAD FAILED IN DUTY TO THEIR PARENTS
2758-161217-0008 THEIR BODIES ARE BLACK BLOOD DRIPS FROM THEIR EYES AND SNAKES TWINE IN THEIR HAIR IN THEIR HANDS THEY BEAR EITHER A DAGGER SCOURGE TORCH OR SERPENT
2758-161217-0009 WHEN THEY PURSUED ORESTES THEY CONSTANTLY HELD UP A MIRROR TO HIS HORRIFIED GAZE IN WHICH HE BEHELD THE FACE OF HIS MURDERED MOTHER
2758-161217-0010 IN LATER TIMES THE FURIES CAME TO BE REGARDED AS SALUTARY AGENCIES WHO BY SEVERELY PUNISHING SIN UPHELD THE CAUSE OF MORALITY AND SOCIAL ORDER AND THUS CONTRIBUTED TO THE WELFARE OF MANKIND
2758-161217-0011 THEY NOW LOSE THEIR AWE INSPIRING ASPECT AND ARE REPRESENTED MORE ESPECIALLY IN ATHENS AS EARNEST MAIDENS DRESSED LIKE ARTEMIS IN SHORT TUNICS SUITABLE FOR THE CHASE BUT STILL RETAINING IN THEIR HANDS
2758-161217-0012 THE POWER WHICH THEY WIELDED OVER THE FATE OF MAN WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INDICATED UNDER THE FIGURE OF A THREAD WHICH THEY SPUN OUT FOR THE LIFE OF EACH HUMAN BEING FROM HIS BIRTH TO THE GRAVE THIS OCCUPATION THEY DIVIDED BETWEEN THEM
2758-161217-0013 ZEUS HIMSELF BEING POWERLESS TO AVERT HER DECREES BUT IN LATER TIMES THIS CONCEPTION OF ONE INEXORABLE ALL CONQUERING FATE BECAME AMPLIFIED BY THE POETS INTO THAT ABOVE DESCRIBED
2758-161217-0014 AND THE MOIRAE ARE HENCEFORTH THE SPECIAL PRESIDING DEITIES OVER THE LIFE AND DEATH OF MORTALS
2758-161217-0015 AGED HIDEOUS AND ALSO LAME WHICH IS EVIDENTLY MEANT TO INDICATE THE SLOW AND HALTING MARCH OF DESTINY WHICH THEY CONTROLLED PAINTERS AND SCULPTORS ON THE OTHER HAND DEPICTED THEM AS BEAUTIFUL MAIDENS OF A GRAVE BUT KINDLY ASPECT
2758-161217-0016 WHICH DEPICTS HER IN ALL THE GRACE OF YOUTH AND BEAUTY SHE IS SITTING SPINNING AND AT HER FEET LIE TWO MASKS ONE COMIC THE OTHER TRAGIC AS THOUGH TO CONVEY THE IDEA THAT
2758-161217-0017 TO A DIVINITY OF FATE THE BRIGHTEST AND SADDEST SCENES OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE ARE ALIKE INDIFFERENT AND THAT SHE QUIETLY AND STEADILY PURSUES HER OCCUPATION REGARDLESS OF HUMAN WEAL OR WOE
2758-161217-0018 IT WAS CONSIDERED THE FUNCTION OF THE MOIRAE TO INDICATE TO THE FURIES THE PRECISE TORTURE WHICH THE WICKED SHOULD UNDERGO FOR THEIR CRIMES
2758-161217-0019 BY AWARDING TO EACH INDIVIDUAL THE FATE WHICH HIS ACTIONS DESERVE SHE REWARDS HUMBLE UNACKNOWLEDGED MERIT PUNISHES CRIME DEPRIVES THE WORTHLESS OF UNDESERVED GOOD FORTUNE
2758-161217-0020 BUT THOUGH NEMESIS IN HER ORIGINAL CHARACTER WAS THE DISTRIBUTOR OF REWARDS AS WELL AS PUNISHMENTS THE WORLD WAS SO FULL OF SIN THAT SHE FOUND BUT LITTLE OCCUPATION IN HER FIRST CAPACITY AND HENCE BECAME FINALLY REGARDED AS THE AVENGING GODDESS ONLY
2758-161217-0021 APOLLO AND ARTEMIS WERE MERELY THE INSTRUMENTS FOR AVENGING THE INSULT OFFERED TO THEIR MOTHER BUT IT WAS NEMESIS WHO PROMPTED THE DEED AND PRESIDED OVER ITS EXECUTION HOMER MAKES NO MENTION OF NEMESIS
2758-161217-0022 A DIADEM CROWNS HER MAJESTIC BROW AND SHE BEARS IN HER HAND A RUDDER BALANCE AND CUBIT FITTING EMBLEMS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH SHE GUIDES WEIGHS AND MEASURES ALL HUMAN EVENTS SHE IS ALSO SOMETIMES SEEN WITH A WHEEL
