1844-145713-0000 AND IN FRONT OF THE CASTLE THERE GREW AN APPLE TREE ON WHICH THERE WERE GOLDEN APPLES ANYONE WHO PICKED AN APPLE GAINED ADMITTANCE INTO THE GOLDEN CASTLE AND THERE IN A SILVER ROOM
1844-145713-0001 SAT AN ENCHANTED PRINCESS OF SURPASSING FAIRNESS AND BEAUTY SHE WAS AS RICH TOO AS SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL FOR THE CELLARS OF THE CASTLE WERE FULL OF PRECIOUS STONES
1844-145713-0002 STOOD ROUND THE WALLS OF ALL THE ROOMS MANY KNIGHTS HAD COME FROM AFAR TO TRY THEIR LUCK BUT IT WAS IN VAIN THEY ATTEMPTED TO CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN IN SPITE
1844-145713-0003 OF HAVING THEIR HORSES SHOD WITH SHARP NAILS NO ONE MANAGED TO GET MORE THAN HALF WAY UP AND THEN THEY ALL FELL BACK RIGHT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STEEP SLIPPERY HILL
1844-145713-0004 SOMETIMES THEY BROKE AN ARM SOMETIMES A LEG AND MANY A BRAVE MAN HAD BROKEN HIS NECK EVEN THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS SAT AT HER WINDOW AND WATCHED
1844-145713-0005 THE BOLD KNIGHTS TRYING TO REACH HER ON THEIR SPLENDID HORSES THE SIGHT OF HER ALWAYS GAVE MEN FRESH COURAGE AND THEY FLOCKED FROM THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THE GLOBE
1844-145713-0006 TO ATTEMPT THE WORK OF RESCUING HER BUT ALL IN VAIN AND FOR SEVEN YEARS THE PRINCESS HAD SAT NOW AND WAITED FOR SOME ONE TO SCALE THE GLASS MOUNTAIN
1844-145713-0007 A HEAP OF CORPSES BOTH OF RIDERS AND HORSES LAY ROUND THE MOUNTAIN AND MANY DYING MEN LAY GROANING THERE UNABLE TO GO ANY FARTHER WITH THEIR
1844-145713-0008 WOUNDED LIMBS THE WHOLE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A VAST CHURCHYARD IN THREE MORE DAYS THE SEVEN YEARS WOULD BE AT AN END
1844-145713-0009 WHEN A KNIGHT IN GOLDEN ARMOUR AND MOUNTED ON A SPIRITED STEED WAS SEEN MAKING HIS WAY TOWARDS THE FATAL HILL
1844-145713-0010 STICKING HIS SPURS INTO HIS HORSE HE MADE A RUSH AT THE MOUNTAIN AND GOT UP HALF WAY THEN HE CALMLY TURNED HIS HORSE'S HEAD
1844-145713-0011 WITHOUT A SLIP OR STUMBLE THE FOLLOWING DAY HE STARTED IN THE SAME WAY THE HORSE TROD ON THE GLASS AS IF IT HAD BEEN LEVEL EARTH AND SPARKS OF FIRE
1844-145713-0012 FLEW FROM ITS HOOFS ALL THE OTHER KNIGHTS GAZED IN ASTONISHMENT FOR HE HAD ALMOST GAINED THE SUMMIT AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE WOULD HAVE REACHED THE APPLE TREE
1844-145713-0013 BUT OF A SUDDEN A HUGE EAGLE ROSE UP AND SPREAD ITS MIGHTY WINGS HITTING AS IT DID SO THE KNIGHT'S HORSE IN THE EYE
1844-145713-0014 THEN REARING HIGH UP IN THE AIR ITS HIND FEET SLIPPED AND IT FELL WITH ITS RIDER DOWN THE STEEP MOUNTAIN SIDE NOTHING WAS LEFT OF EITHER OF THEM EXCEPT THEIR BONES
1844-145713-0015 WHICH RATTLED IN THE BATTERED GOLDEN ARMOUR LIKE DRY PEAS IN A POD AND NOW THERE WAS ONLY ONE MORE DAY BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THE SEVEN YEARS
1844-145713-0016 THEN THERE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE A MERE SCHOOLBOY A MERRY HAPPY HEARTED YOUTH BUT AT THE SAME TIME STRONG AND WELL GROWN
1844-145713-0017 HE SAW HOW MANY KNIGHTS HAD BROKEN THEIR NECKS IN VAIN BUT UNDAUNTED HE APPROACHED THE STEEP MOUNTAIN ON FOOT
1844-145713-0018 FOR LONG HE HAD HEARD HIS PARENTS SPEAK OF THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS WHO SAT IN THE GOLDEN CASTLE AT THE TOP OF THE GLASS MOUNTAIN HE LISTENED TO ALL HE HEARD AND DETERMINED THAT HE TOO WOULD TRY HIS LUCK
1844-145713-0019 BUT FIRST HE WENT TO THE FOREST AND CAUGHT A LYNX AND CUTTING OFF THE CREATURE'S SHARP CLAWS HE FASTENED THEM ON TO HIS OWN HANDS AND FEET ARMED WITH THESE WEAPONS HE BOLDLY STARTED UP THE GLASS MOUNTAIN
1844-145713-0020 THE SUN WAS NEARLY GOING DOWN AND THE YOUTH HAD NOT GOT MORE THAN HALF WAY UP HE COULD HARDLY DRAW BREATH HE WAS SO WORN OUT AND HIS MOUTH WAS PARCHED BY THIRST
1844-145713-0021 BUT IN VAIN DID HE BEG AND BESEECH HER TO LET A DROP OF WATER FALL ON HIM HE OPENED HIS MOUTH BUT THE BLACK CLOUD SAILED PAST
1844-145713-0022 AND NOT AS MUCH AS A DROP OF DEW MOISTENED HIS DRY LIPS HIS FEET WERE TORN AND BLEEDING AND HE COULD ONLY HOLD ON NOW WITH HIS HANDS
1844-145713-0023 THEN HE GAZED BENEATH HIM AND WHAT A SIGHT MET HIS EYES A YAWNING ABYSS WITH CERTAIN AND TERRIBLE DEATH AT THE BOTTOM REEKING WITH HALF DECAYED BODIES OF HORSES AND RIDERS
1844-145713-0024 AND THIS
1844-145713-0025 IT WAS ALMOST PITCH DARK NOW AND ONLY THE STARS LIT UP THE GLASS MOUNTAIN THE POOR BOY STILL CLUNG ON AS IF GLUED TO THE GLASS
1844-145713-0026 BY HIS BLOOD STAINED HANDS HE MADE NO STRUGGLE TO GET HIGHER FOR ALL HIS STRENGTH HAD LEFT HIM AND SEEING NO HOPE HE CALMLY AWAITED DEATH THEN
1844-145713-0027 HE SLUMBERED SWEETLY BUT ALL THE SAME ALTHOUGH HE SLEPT HE HAD STUCK HIS SHARP CLAWS SO FIRMLY INTO THE GLASS THAT HE WAS QUITE SAFE NOT TO FALL
1844-145713-0028 NOW THE GOLDEN APPLE TREE WAS GUARDED BY THE EAGLE WHICH HAD OVERTHROWN THE GOLDEN KNIGHT AND HIS HORSE EVERY NIGHT IT FLEW ROUND THE GLASS MOUNTAIN KEEPING A CAREFUL LOOK OUT
1844-145713-0029 AND NO SOONER HAD THE MOON EMERGED FROM THE CLOUDS THAN THE BIRD ROSE UP FROM THE APPLE TREE AND CIRCLING ROUND IN THE AIR
1844-145713-0030 GREEDY FOR CARRION
1844-145713-0031 DOWN UPON THE BOY BUT HE WAS AWAKE NOW AND PERCEIVING THE EAGLE HE DETERMINED BY ITS HELP TO SAVE HIMSELF
1844-145713-0032 THE EAGLE DUG ITS SHARP CLAWS INTO THE TENDER FLESH OF THE YOUTH BUT HE BORE THE PAIN WITHOUT A SOUND AND SEIZED THE BIRD'S TWO FEET WITH HIS HANDS
1844-145713-0033 THE CREATURE IN TERROR LIFTED HIM HIGH UP INTO THE AIR AND BEGAN TO CIRCLE ROUND THE TOWER OF THE CASTLE THE YOUTH HELD ON BRAVELY HE SAW THE GLITTERING PALACE
1844-145713-0034 WHICH BY THE PALE RAYS OF THE MOON LOOKED LIKE A DIM LAMP AND HE SAW THE HIGH WINDOWS AND ROUND ONE OF THEM A BALCONY IN WHICH THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS SAT LOST IN SAD THOUGHTS
1844-145713-0035 THEN THE BOY SAW THAT HE WAS CLOSE TO THE APPLE TREE AND DRAWING A SMALL KNIFE FROM HIS BELT HE CUT OFF BOTH THE EAGLE'S FEET THE BIRD ROSE UP IN THE AIR IN ITS AGONY
1844-145713-0036 AND VANISHED INTO THE CLOUDS AND THE YOUTH FELL ON TO THE BROAD BRANCHES OF THE APPLE TREE THEN HE DREW OUT THE CLAWS OF THE EAGLE'S FEET THAT HAD REMAINED IN HIS FLESH AND PUT THE PEEL OF ONE OF THE GOLDEN APPLES ON THE WOUND
1844-145713-0037 AND IN ONE MOMENT IT WAS HEALED AND WELL AGAIN HE PULLED SEVERAL OF THE BEAUTIFUL APPLES AND PUT THEM IN HIS POCKET THEN HE ENTERED THE CASTLE THE DOOR WAS GUARDED BY A GREAT DRAGON BUT AS SOON AS HE THREW AN APPLE AT IT THE BEAST VANISHED
1844-145713-0038 AND THE YOUTH PERCEIVED A COURTYARD FULL OF FLOWERS AND BEAUTIFUL TREES AND ON A BALCONY SAT THE LOVELY ENCHANTED PRINCESS WITH HER RETINUE AS SOON AS SHE SAW THE YOUTH SHE RAN TOWARDS HIM AND GREETED HIM AS HER HUSBAND
1844-145713-0039 AND MASTER SHE GAVE HIM ALL HER TREASURES
1844-145713-0040 BUT HE NEVER RETURNED TO THE EARTH FOR ONLY THE MIGHTY EAGLE WHO HAD BEEN THE GUARDIAN OF THE PRINCESS AND OF THE CASTLE COULD HAVE CARRIED ON HIS WINGS THE ENORMOUS TREASURE DOWN TO THE WORLD
1844-145713-0041 BUT AS THE EAGLE HAD LOST ITS FEET IT DIED AND ITS BODY WAS FOUND IN A WOOD ON THE GLASS MOUNTAIN ONE DAY WHEN THE YOUTH WAS STROLLING ABOUT IN THE PALACE GARDEN WITH THE PRINCESS HIS WIFE
1844-145713-0042 HE LOOKED DOWN OVER THE EDGE OF THE GLASS MOUNTAIN AND SAW TO HIS ASTONISHMENT A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE GATHERED THERE HE BLEW HIS SILVER WHISTLE
1844-145713-0043 FLY DOWN AND ASK WHAT THE MATTER IS HE SAID TO THE LITTLE BIRD
1844-145713-0044 AND SOON RETURNED SAYING THE BLOOD OF THE EAGLE HAS RESTORED ALL THE PEOPLE BELOW TO LIFE ALL THOSE WHO HAVE PERISHED ON THIS MOUNTAIN ARE AWAKENING UP TO DAY
