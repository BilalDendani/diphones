1844-144486-0000 AND I WAS STRONGER THAN EVER IN THOSE TREMENDOUS PRACTICAL RESOLUTIONS THAT I FELT THE CRISIS REQUIRED I CONTINUED TO WALK EXTREMELY FAST AND TO HAVE A GENERAL IDEA THAT I WAS GETTING ON
1844-144486-0001 I MADE IT A RULE TO TAKE AS MUCH OUT OF MYSELF AS I POSSIBLY COULD IN MY WAY OF DOING EVERYTHING TO WHICH I APPLIED MY ENERGIES I MADE A PERFECT VICTIM OF MYSELF I EVEN ENTERTAINED SOME IDEA OF PUTTING MYSELF ON A VEGETABLE DIET
1844-144486-0002 VAGUELY CONCEIVING THAT IN BECOMING A GRAMINIVOROUS ANIMAL I SHOULD SACRIFICE TO DORA AS YET LITTLE DORA WAS QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF MY DESPERATE FIRMNESS OTHERWISE THAN AS MY LETTERS DARKLY SHADOWED IT FORTH
1844-144486-0003 BUT ANOTHER SATURDAY CAME AND ON THAT SATURDAY EVENING SHE WAS TO BE AT MISS MILLS'S AND WHEN MISTER MILLS HAD GONE TO HIS WHIST CLUB TELEGRAPHED TO ME IN THE STREET BY A BIRD CAGE IN THE DRAWING ROOM MIDDLE WINDOW
1844-144486-0004 I WAS TO GO THERE TO TEA BY THIS TIME WE WERE QUITE SETTLED DOWN IN BUCKINGHAM STREET WHERE MISTER DICK CONTINUED HIS COPYING IN A STATE OF ABSOLUTE FELICITY
1844-144486-0005 THROWING THE FIRST PITCHER SHE PLANTED ON THE STAIRS OUT OF WINDOW AND PROTECTING IN PERSON UP AND DOWN THE STAIRCASE A SUPERNUMERARY WHOM SHE ENGAGED FROM THE OUTER WORLD
1844-144486-0006 THESE VIGOROUS MEASURES STRUCK SUCH TERROR TO THE BREAST OF MISSUS CRUPP THAT SHE SUBSIDED INTO HER OWN KITCHEN UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT MY AUNT WAS MAD
1844-144486-0007 MISSUS CRUPP OF LATE THE BOLD BECAME WITHIN A FEW DAYS SO FAINT HEARTED THAT RATHER THAN ENCOUNTER MY AUNT UPON THE STAIRCASE
1844-144486-0008 SHE WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO HIDE HER PORTLY FORM BEHIND DOORS LEAVING VISIBLE HOWEVER A WIDE MARGIN OF FLANNEL PETTICOAT OR WOULD SHRINK INTO DARK CORNERS
1844-144486-0009 THIS GAVE MY AUNT SUCH UNSPEAKABLE SATISFACTION THAT I BELIEVE SHE TOOK A DELIGHT IN PROWLING UP AND DOWN WITH HER BONNET INSANELY PERCHED ON THE TOP OF HER HEAD AT TIMES WHEN MISSUS CRUPP WAS LIKELY TO BE IN THE WAY
1844-144486-0010 MY AUNT BEING UNCOMMONLY NEAT AND INGENIOUS MADE SO MANY LITTLE IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS THAT I SEEMED TO BE RICHER INSTEAD OF POORER
1844-144486-0011 HOW TO MAKE ME HAPPY PEGGOTTY HAD CONSIDERED HERSELF HIGHLY PRIVILEGED IN BEING ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE LABOURS AND ALTHOUGH SHE STILL RETAINED SOMETHING OF HER OLD SENTIMENT OF AWE IN REFERENCE TO MY AUNT
1844-144486-0012 HAD RECEIVED SO MANY MARKS OF ENCOURAGEMENT AND CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WERE THE BEST FRIENDS POSSIBLE BUT THE TIME HAD NOW COME I AM SPEAKING OF THE SATURDAY WHEN I WAS TO TAKE TEA AT MISS MILLS'S
1844-144486-0013 AND ENTER ON THE DISCHARGE OF THE DUTIES SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN IN BEHALF OF HAM
1844-144486-0014 I TOOK PEGGOTTY TO THE COACH OFFICE AND SAW HER OFF SHE CRIED AT PARTING AND CONFIDED HER BROTHER TO MY FRIENDSHIP AS HAM HAD DONE WE HAD HEARD NOTHING OF HIM SINCE HE WENT AWAY THAT SUNNY AFTERNOON
1844-144486-0015 AND NOW MY OWN DEAR DAVY SAID PEGGOTTY IF WHILE YOU'RE A PRENTICE YOU SHOULD WANT ANY MONEY TO SPEND OR IF WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR TIME MY DEAR YOU SHOULD WANT ANY TO SET YOU UP AND YOU MUST DO ONE OR OTHER OR BOTH MY DARLING
1844-144486-0016 WHO HAS SUCH A GOOD RIGHT TO ASK LEAVE TO LEND IT YOU AS MY SWEET GIRL'S OWN OLD STUPID ME I WAS NOT SO SAVAGELY INDEPENDENT AS TO SAY ANYTHING IN REPLY
1844-144486-0017 NEXT TO ACCEPTING A LARGE SUM ON THE SPOT I BELIEVE THIS GAVE PEGGOTTY MORE COMFORT THAN ANYTHING I COULD HAVE DONE AND MY DEAR WHISPERED PEGGOTTY TELL THE PRETTY LITTLE ANGEL THAT I SHOULD SO HAVE LIKED TO SEE HER ONLY FOR A MINUTE
1844-144486-0018 AND TELL HER THAT BEFORE SHE MARRIES MY BOY I'LL COME AND MAKE YOUR HOUSE SO BEAUTIFUL FOR YOU IF YOU'LL LET ME
1844-144486-0019 I FATIGUED MYSELF AS MUCH AS I POSSIBLY COULD IN THE COMMONS ALL DAY BY A VARIETY OF DEVICES AND AT THE APPOINTED TIME IN THE EVENING REPAIRED TO MISTER MILLS'S STREET MISTER MILLS WHO WAS A TERRIBLE FELLOW TO FALL ASLEEP AFTER DINNER
1844-144486-0020 THAT I FERVENTLY HOPED THE CLUB WOULD FINE HIM FOR BEING LATE AT LAST HE CAME OUT AND THEN I SAW MY OWN DORA HANG UP THE BIRD CAGE AND PEEP INTO THE BALCONY TO LOOK FOR ME
1844-144486-0021 AND WE ALL THREE WENT IN AS HAPPY AND LOVING AS COULD BE
1844-144486-0022 BY ASKING DORA WITHOUT THE SMALLEST PREPARATION IF SHE COULD LOVE A BEGGAR MY PRETTY LITTLE STARTLED DORA
1844-144486-0023 HER ONLY ASSOCIATION WITH THE WORD WAS A YELLOW FACE AND A NIGHTCAP OR A PAIR OF CRUTCHES OR A WOODEN LEG OR A DOG WITH A DECANTER STAND IN HIS MOUTH OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND AND SHE STARED AT ME WITH THE MOST DELIGHTFUL WONDER
1844-144486-0024 HOW CAN YOU ASK ME ANYTHING SO FOOLISH POUTED DORA LOVE A BEGGAR DORA MY OWN DEAREST SAID I I AM A BEGGAR HOW CAN YOU BE SUCH A SILLY THING REPLIED DORA SLAPPING MY HAND
1844-144486-0025 AS TO SIT THERE TELLING SUCH STORIES I'LL MAKE JIP BITE YOU HER CHILDISH WAY WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS WAY IN THE WORLD TO ME BUT IT WAS NECESSARY TO BE EXPLICIT AND I SOLEMNLY REPEATED DORA
1844-144486-0026 I DECLARE I'LL MAKE JIP BITE YOU SAID DORA SHAKING HER CURLS IF YOU ARE SO RIDICULOUS BUT I LOOKED SO SERIOUS THAT DORA LEFT OFF SHAKING HER CURLS AND LAID HER TREMBLING LITTLE HAND UPON MY SHOULDER AND FIRST LOOKED SCARED AND ANXIOUS
1844-144486-0027 THEN BEGAN TO CRY THAT WAS DREADFUL I FELL UPON MY KNEES BEFORE THE SOFA CARESSING HER
1844-144486-0028 AND OH SHE WAS SO FRIGHTENED AND WHERE WAS JULIA MILLS AND OH TAKE HER TO JULIA MILLS AND GO AWAY PLEASE UNTIL I WAS ALMOST BESIDE MYSELF
1844-144486-0029 AT LAST AFTER AN AGONY OF SUPPLICATION AND PROTESTATION I GOT DORA TO LOOK AT ME WITH A HORRIFIED EXPRESSION OF FACE WHICH I GRADUALLY SOOTHED UNTIL IT WAS ONLY LOVING AND HER SOFT PRETTY CHEEK WAS LYING AGAINST MINE
1844-144486-0030 THEN I TOLD HER WITH MY ARMS CLASPED ROUND HER HOW I LOVED HER SO DEARLY AND SO DEARLY HOW I FELT IT RIGHT TO OFFER TO RELEASE HER FROM HER ENGAGEMENT BECAUSE NOW I WAS POOR HOW I NEVER COULD BEAR IT OR RECOVER IT
1844-144486-0031 IF I LOST HER HOW I HAD NO FEARS OF POVERTY IF SHE HAD NONE MY ARM BEING NERVED AND MY HEART INSPIRED BY HER HOW I WAS ALREADY WORKING WITH A COURAGE SUCH AS NONE BUT LOVERS KNEW
1844-144486-0032 HOW I HAD BEGUN TO BE PRACTICAL AND LOOK INTO THE FUTURE HOW A CRUST WELL EARNED WAS SWEETER FAR THAN A FEAST INHERITED AND MUCH MORE TO THE SAME PURPOSE WHICH I DELIVERED IN A BURST OF PASSIONATE ELOQUENCE QUITE SURPRISING TO MYSELF
1844-144486-0033 THOUGH I HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT DAY AND NIGHT EVER SINCE MY AUNT HAD ASTONISHED ME IS YOUR HEART MINE STILL DEAR DORA SAID I RAPTUROUSLY FOR I KNEW BY HER CLINGING TO ME THAT IT WAS OH YES CRIED DORA OH YES IT'S ALL YOURS OH DON'T BE DREADFUL
1844-144486-0034 I DREADFUL TO DORA DON'T TALK ABOUT BEING POOR AND WORKING HARD SAID DORA NESTLING CLOSER TO ME OH DON'T DON'T MY DEAREST LOVE SAID I THE CRUST WELL EARNED OH YES BUT I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE ABOUT CRUSTS SAID DORA
1844-144486-0035 I WAS CHARMED WITH HER CHILDISH WINNING WAY I FONDLY EXPLAINED TO DORA THAT JIP SHOULD HAVE HIS MUTTON CHOP WITH HIS ACCUSTOMED REGULARITY
1844-144486-0036 SKETCHING IN THE LITTLE HOUSE I HAD SEEN AT HIGHGATE AND MY AUNT IN HER ROOM UPSTAIRS I AM NOT DREADFUL NOW DORA SAID I TENDERLY OH NO NO CRIED DORA BUT I HOPE YOUR AUNT WILL KEEP IN HER OWN ROOM A GOOD DEAL
1844-144486-0037 AND I HOPE SHE'S NOT A SCOLDING OLD THING IF IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME TO LOVE DORA MORE THAN EVER I AM SURE I DID BUT I FELT SHE WAS A LITTLE IMPRACTICABLE IT DAMPED MY NEW BORN ARDOUR TO FIND THAT ARDOUR SO DIFFICULT OF COMMUNICATION TO HER
1844-144486-0038 MY OWN MAY I MENTION SOMETHING OH PLEASE DON'T BE PRACTICAL SAID DORA COAXINGLY BECAUSE IT FRIGHTENS ME SO SWEETHEART I RETURNED THERE IS NOTHING TO ALARM YOU IN ALL THIS I WANT YOU TO THINK OF IT QUITE DIFFERENTLY
1844-144486-0039 I WANT TO MAKE IT NERVE YOU AND INSPIRE YOU DORA OH BUT THAT'S SO SHOCKING CRIED DORA MY LOVE NO PERSEVERANCE AND STRENGTH OF CHARACTER WILL ENABLE US TO BEAR MUCH WORSE THINGS
1844-144486-0040 BUT I HAVEN'T GOT ANY STRENGTH AT ALL SAID DORA SHAKING HER CURLS HAVE I JIP OH DO KISS JIP AND BE AGREEABLE
1844-144486-0041 AS SHE DIRECTED THE OPERATION WHICH SHE INSISTED SHOULD BE PERFORMED SYMMETRICALLY ON THE CENTRE OF HIS NOSE I DID AS SHE BADE ME REWARDING MYSELF AFTERWARDS FOR MY OBEDIENCE
1844-144486-0042 AND SHE CHARMED ME OUT OF MY GRAVER CHARACTER FOR I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG BUT DORA MY BELOVED SAID I AT LAST RESUMING IT I WAS GOING TO MENTION SOMETHING
1844-144486-0043 TO SEE HER FOLD HER LITTLE HANDS AND HOLD THEM UP BEGGING AND PRAYING ME NOT TO BE DREADFUL ANY MORE INDEED I AM NOT GOING TO BE MY DARLING I ASSURED HER BUT DORA MY LOVE IF YOU WILL SOMETIMES THINK NOT DESPONDINGLY
1844-144486-0044 JUST TO ENCOURAGE YOURSELF THAT YOU ARE ENGAGED TO A POOR MAN DON'T DON'T PRAY DON'T CRIED DORA IT'S SO VERY DREADFUL MY SOUL NOT AT ALL SAID I CHEERFULLY
1844-144486-0045 POOR LITTLE DORA RECEIVED THIS SUGGESTION WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS HALF A SOB AND HALF A SCREAM IT WOULD BE SO USEFUL TO US AFTERWARDS I WENT ON
1844-144486-0046 A LITTLE COOKERY BOOK THAT I WOULD SEND YOU IT WOULD BE SO EXCELLENT FOR BOTH OF US FOR OUR PATH IN LIFE MY DORA SAID I WARMING WITH THE SUBJECT IS STONY AND RUGGED NOW AND IT RESTS WITH US TO SMOOTH IT WE MUST FIGHT OUR WAY ONWARD
1844-144486-0047 WE MUST BE BRAVE THERE ARE OBSTACLES TO BE MET AND WE MUST MEET AND CRUSH THEM
1844-144486-0048 WITH A CLENCHED HAND AND A MOST ENTHUSIASTIC COUNTENANCE BUT IT WAS QUITE UNNECESSARY TO PROCEED I HAD SAID ENOUGH I HAD DONE IT AGAIN OH SHE WAS SO FRIGHTENED OH WHERE WAS JULIA MILLS
1844-144486-0049 OH TAKE HER TO JULIA MILLS AND GO AWAY PLEASE SO THAT IN SHORT I WAS QUITE DISTRACTED AND RAVED ABOUT THE DRAWING ROOM I THOUGHT I HAD KILLED HER THIS TIME I SPRINKLED WATER ON HER FACE
1844-144486-0050 I WENT DOWN ON MY KNEES I PLUCKED AT MY HAIR
1844-144486-0051 I IMPLORED HER FORGIVENESS I BESOUGHT HER TO LOOK UP
1844-144486-0052 AND DROPPED ALL THE NEEDLES OVER DORA
1844-144486-0053 I DID EVERY WILD EXTRAVAGANCE THAT COULD BE DONE
1844-144486-0054 WHEN MISS MILLS CAME INTO THE ROOM WHO HAS DONE THIS EXCLAIMED MISS MILLS SUCCOURING HER FRIEND I REPLIED I MISS MILLS I HAVE DONE IT BEHOLD THE DESTROYER OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT AND HID MY FACE FROM THE LIGHT IN THE SOFA CUSHION
1844-144486-0055 AT FIRST MISS MILLS THOUGHT IT WAS A QUARREL AND THAT WE WERE VERGING ON THE DESERT OF SAHARA BUT SHE SOON FOUND OUT HOW MATTERS STOOD FOR MY DEAR AFFECTIONATE LITTLE DORA EMBRACING HER BEGAN EXCLAIMING THAT I WAS A POOR LABOURER
1844-144486-0056 WOULD I LET HER GIVE ME ALL HER MONEY TO KEEP AND THEN FELL ON MISS MILLS'S NECK SOBBING AS IF HER TENDER HEART WERE BROKEN MISS MILLS MUST HAVE BEEN BORN TO BE A BLESSING TO US
1844-144486-0057 SHE ASCERTAINED FROM ME IN A FEW WORDS WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT COMFORTED DORA AND GRADUALLY CONVINCED HER THAT I WAS NOT A LABOURER FROM MY MANNER OF STATING THE CASE I BELIEVE DORA CONCLUDED THAT I WAS A NAVIGATOR
1844-144486-0058 AND WENT BALANCING MYSELF UP AND DOWN A PLANK ALL DAY WITH A WHEELBARROW AND SO BROUGHT US TOGETHER IN PEACE
1844-144486-0059 MISS MILLS RANG FOR TEA
1844-144486-0060 TO EXPOUND TO DORA MISS MILLS REPLIED ON GENERAL PRINCIPLES THAT THE COTTAGE OF CONTENT WAS BETTER THAN THE PALACE OF COLD SPLENDOUR AND THAT WHERE LOVE WAS ALL WAS I SAID TO MISS MILLS THAT THIS WAS VERY TRUE
1844-144486-0061 AND WHO SHOULD KNOW IT BETTER THAN I WHO LOVED DORA WITH A LOVE THAT NEVER MORTAL HAD EXPERIENCED YET BUT ON MISS MILLS OBSERVING WITH DESPONDENCY THAT IT WERE WELL INDEED FOR SOME HEARTS IF THIS WERE SO
1844-144486-0062 I EXPLAINED THAT I BEGGED LEAVE TO RESTRICT THE OBSERVATION TO MORTALS OF THE MASCULINE GENDER
1844-144486-0063 I THEN PUT IT TO MISS MILLS TO SAY WHETHER SHE CONSIDERED THAT THERE WAS OR WAS NOT ANY PRACTICAL MERIT IN THE SUGGESTION I HAD BEEN ANXIOUS TO MAKE CONCERNING THE ACCOUNTS THE HOUSEKEEPING AND THE COOKERY BOOK MISS MILLS AFTER SOME CONSIDERATION THUS REPLIED
1844-144486-0064 MISTER COPPERFIELD I WILL BE PLAIN WITH YOU MENTAL SUFFERING AND TRIAL SUPPLY IN SOME NATURES THE PLACE OF YEARS
1844-144486-0065 NO THE SUGGESTION IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO OUR DORA
1844-144486-0066 I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT IF IT COULD BE DONE IT MIGHT BE WELL BUT AND MISS MILLS SHOOK HER HEAD I WAS ENCOURAGED BY THIS CLOSING ADMISSION ON THE PART OF MISS MILLS TO ASK HER
1844-144486-0067 WHETHER FOR DORA'S SAKE IF SHE HAD ANY OPPORTUNITY OF LURING HER ATTENTION TO SUCH PREPARATIONS FOR AN EARNEST LIFE SHE WOULD AVAIL HERSELF OF IT
1844-144486-0068 UNDERTAKE TO DO ME THAT CROWNING SERVICE
1844-144486-0069 AND SHE LOVED ME SO MUCH AND WAS SO CAPTIVATING PARTICULARLY WHEN SHE MADE JIP STAND ON HIS HIND LEGS FOR TOAST AND WHEN SHE PRETENDED TO HOLD THAT NOSE OF HIS AGAINST THE HOT TEAPOT FOR PUNISHMENT BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T THAT I FELT LIKE A SORT OF MONSTER WHO HAD GOT INTO A FAIRY'S BOWER
1844-144486-0070 WHEN I THOUGHT OF HAVING FRIGHTENED HER AND MADE HER CRY AFTER TEA WE HAD THE GUITAR AND DORA SANG THOSE SAME DEAR OLD FRENCH SONGS ABOUT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF EVER ON ANY ACCOUNT LEAVING OFF DANCING LA RA LA LA RA LA
1844-144486-0071 UNTIL I FELT A MUCH GREATER MONSTER THAN BEFORE WE HAD ONLY ONE CHECK TO OUR PLEASURE AND THAT HAPPENED A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE I TOOK MY LEAVE WHEN MISS MILLS CHANCING TO MAKE SOME ALLUSION TO TOMORROW MORNING I UNLUCKILY LET OUT THAT
1844-144486-0072 BEING OBLIGED TO EXERT MYSELF NOW I GOT UP AT FIVE O'CLOCK WHETHER DORA HAD ANY IDEA THAT I WAS A PRIVATE WATCHMAN I AM UNABLE TO SAY BUT IT MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION ON HER AND SHE NEITHER PLAYED NOR SANG ANY MORE
1844-144486-0073 AND SHE SAID TO ME IN HER PRETTY COAXING WAY AS IF I WERE A DOLL I USED TO THINK NOW DON'T GET UP AT FIVE O'CLOCK YOU NAUGHTY BOY IT'S SO NONSENSICAL
