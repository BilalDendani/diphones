5588-39648-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR OF THE EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES D'ARTAGNAN LOST NO TIME AND AS SOON AS THE THING WAS SUITABLE AND OPPORTUNE HE PAID A VISIT TO THE LORD TREASURER OF HIS MAJESTY HE HAD THEN THE SATISFACTION TO EXCHANGE
5588-39648-0001 A PIECE OF PAPER COVERED WITH VERY UGLY WRITING FOR A PRODIGIOUS NUMBER OF CROWNS RECENTLY STAMPED WITH THE EFFIGIES
5588-39648-0002 D'ARTAGNAN EASILY CONTROLLED HIMSELF AND YET ON THIS OCCASION HE COULD NOT HELP EVINCING A JOY WHICH THE READER WILL PERHAPS COMPREHEND IF HE DEIGNS TO HAVE SOME INDULGENCE FOR A MAN WHO SINCE HIS BIRTH
5588-39648-0003 HAD NEVER SEEN SO MANY PIECES AND ROLLS OF PIECES JUXTA PLACED IN AN ORDER TRULY AGREEABLE TO THE EYE THE TREASURER PLACED ALL THE ROLLS IN BAGS AND CLOSED EACH BAG WITH A STAMP SEALED WITH THE ARMS OF ENGLAND
5588-39648-0004 A FAVOR WHICH TREASURERS DO NOT GRANT TO EVERYBODY THEN IMPASSIBLE AND JUST AS POLITE AS HE OUGHT TO BE TOWARDS A MAN HONORED WITH THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE KING HE SAID TO D'ARTAGNAN TAKE AWAY YOUR MONEY SIR YOUR MONEY
5588-39648-0005 THESE WORDS MADE A THOUSAND CHORDS VIBRATE IN THE HEART OF D'ARTAGNAN WHICH HE HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE HE HAD THE BAGS PACKED IN A SMALL CART AND RETURNED HOME MEDITATING DEEPLY
