6167-282391-0000 AND IN HER FRIGHT AND HASTE TO GET AWAY RAN ACROSS THE LION'S NOSE ROUSED FROM HIS NAP THE LION LAID HIS HUGE PAW ANGRILY ON THE TINY CREATURE TO KILL HER
6167-282391-0001 SOME DAYS LATER WHILE STALKING HIS PREY IN THE FOREST THE LION WAS CAUGHT IN THE TOILS OF A HUNTER'S NET UNABLE TO FREE HIMSELF HE FILLED THE FOREST WITH HIS ANGRY ROARING
6167-282391-0002 THE MOUSE KNEW THE VOICE AND QUICKLY FOUND THE LION STRUGGLING IN THE NET RUNNING TO ONE OF THE GREAT ROPES THAT BOUND HIM SHE GNAWED IT UNTIL IT PARTED AND SOON THE LION WAS FREE
6167-282391-0003 SAID THE MOUSE NOW YOU SEE THAT EVEN A MOUSE CAN HELP A LION A KINDNESS
6167-282391-0004 A SHEPHERD BOY TENDED HIS MASTER'S SHEEP NEAR A DARK FOREST NOT FAR FROM THE VILLAGE SOON HE FOUND LIFE IN THE PASTURE VERY DULL ALL HE COULD DO
6167-282391-0005 TO AMUSE HIMSELF WAS TO TALK TO HIS DOG OR PLAY ON HIS SHEPHERD'S PIPE ONE DAY AS HE SAT WATCHING THE SHEEP AND THE QUIET FOREST AND THINKING WHAT HE WOULD DO SHOULD HE SEE A WOLF
6167-282391-0006 HE THOUGHT OF A PLAN TO AMUSE HIMSELF HIS MASTER HAD TOLD HIM TO CALL FOR HELP SHOULD A WOLF ATTACK THE FLOCK AND THE VILLAGERS WOULD DRIVE IT AWAY SO NOW
6167-282391-0007 THOUGH HE HAD NOT SEEN ANYTHING THAT EVEN LOOKED LIKE A WOLF HE RAN TOWARD THE VILLAGE SHOUTING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE WOLF WOLF AS HE EXPECTED THE VILLAGERS WHO HEARD THE CRY
6167-282391-0008 DROPPED THEIR WORK AND RAN IN GREAT EXCITEMENT TO THE PASTURE BUT WHEN THEY GOT THERE THEY FOUND THE BOY DOUBLED UP WITH LAUGHTER AT THE TRICK HE HAD PLAYED ON THEM A FEW DAYS LATER
6167-282391-0009 THE SHEPHERD BOY AGAIN SHOUTED WOLF WOLF AGAIN THE VILLAGERS RAN TO HELP HIM ONLY TO BE LAUGHED AT AGAIN THEN ONE EVENING
6167-282391-0010 AS THE SUN WAS SETTING BEHIND THE FOREST AND THE SHADOWS WERE CREEPING OUT OVER THE PASTURE A WOLF REALLY DID SPRING FROM THE UNDERBRUSH AND FALL UPON THE SHEEP IN TERROR
6167-282391-0011 THE BOY RAN TOWARD THE VILLAGE SHOUTING WOLF WOLF BUT THOUGH THE VILLAGERS HEARD THE CRY THEY DID NOT RUN TO HELP HIM AS THEY HAD BEFORE HE CANNOT FOOL US AGAIN
6167-282391-0012 THEY SAID THE WOLF KILLED A GREAT MANY OF THE BOY'S SHEEP AND THEN SLIPPED AWAY INTO THE FOREST LIARS ARE NOT BELIEVED EVEN WHEN THEY SPEAK THE TRUTH
6167-282391-0013 A GNAT FLEW OVER THE MEADOW WITH MUCH BUZZING FOR SO SMALL A CREATURE AND SETTLED ON THE TIP OF ONE OF THE HORNS OF A BULL AFTER HE HAD RESTED A SHORT TIME
6167-282391-0014 HE MADE READY TO FLY AWAY BUT BEFORE HE LEFT HE BEGGED THE BULL'S PARDON FOR HAVING USED HIS HORN FOR A RESTING PLACE YOU MUST BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE ME GO NOW HE SAID
6167-282391-0015 IT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME REPLIED THE BULL I DID NOT EVEN KNOW YOU WERE THERE WE ARE OFTEN OF GREATER IMPORTANCE IN OUR OWN EYES
6167-282391-0016 THAN IN THE EYES OF OUR NEIGHBOR THE SMALLER THE MIND
6167-282391-0017 TWO TRAVELLERS WALKING IN THE NOONDAY SUN SOUGHT THE SHADE OF A WIDESPREADING TREE TO REST AS THEY LAY LOOKING UP AMONG THE PLEASANT LEAVES THEY SAW THAT IT WAS A PLANE TREE
6167-282391-0018 HOW USELESS IS THE PLANE SAID ONE OF THEM IT BEARS NO FRUIT WHATEVER AND ONLY SERVES TO LITTER THE GROUND WITH LEAVES UNGRATEFUL CREATURES
6167-282391-0019 SAID A VOICE FROM THE PLANE TREE YOU LIE HERE IN MY COOLING SHADE AND YET YOU SAY I AM USELESS THUS UNGRATEFULLY O JUPITER DO MEN RECEIVE THEIR BLESSINGS
