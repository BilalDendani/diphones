4824-36027-0000 ACCIDENT THAT IS TO SAY A CHANCE SOMEWHAT MORE FORTUITOUS THAN THE COMMON HAZARDS WHICH WE GROUP TOGETHER AND CALL EXISTENCE PUSHED EDWIN INTO THE NEXT STAGE OF HIS CAREER
4824-36027-0001 AS ON ONE AFTERNOON IN LATE JUNE HE WAS TURNING THE CORNER OF TRAFALGAR ROAD TO ENTER THE SHOP HE SURPRISINGLY ENCOUNTERED CHARLIE ORGREAVE WHOM HE HAD NOT SEEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS
4824-36027-0002 AND WHEN HE SAW THIS FIGURE AT ONCE FASHIONABLY AND CARELESSLY DRESSED
4824-36027-0003 HE HAD SCARCELY WORN THE SUIT AT ALL BUT THAT AFTERNOON HIS FATHER HAD SENT HIM OVER TO HANBRIDGE ABOUT A LARGE ORDER FROM BOSTOCKS THE RECENTLY ESTABLISHED DRAPERS THERE WHOSE EXTRAVAGANT ADVERTISING HAD SHOCKED AND PAINED THE COMMERCE OF THE FIVE TOWNS
4824-36027-0004 AND THUS THE NEW COSTLY SUIT HAD BEEN AS IT WERE OFFICIALLY BLESSED AND HENCEFORTH COULD NOT BE CONDEMNED
4824-36027-0005 I'VE JUST BEEN IN TO SEE YOU AT YOUR SHOP EDWIN PAUSED HELLO THE SUNDAY HE SAID QUIETLY
4824-36027-0006 IT'S A BIT OF LUCK I'VE GOT THESE CLOTHES ON AND HE WAS IN FACT RATHER SORRY THAT CHARLIE PROBABLY PAID NO REAL ATTENTION TO CLOTHES THE NEW SUIT HAD CAUSED EDWIN TO LOOK AT EVERYBODY'S CLOTHES HAD CAUSED HIM TO WALK DIFFERENTLY AND TO PUT HIS SHOULDERS BACK
4824-36027-0007 AND TO CHANGE THE STYLE OF HIS COLLARS HAD MADE A DIFFERENT MAN OF EDWIN COME IN WILL YOU EDWIN SUGGESTED THEY WENT INTO THE SHOP TOGETHER
4824-36027-0008 STIFFORD SMILED AT THEM BOTH AS IF TO FELICITATE THEM ON THE CHANCE WHICH HAD BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER COME IN HERE SAID EDWIN INDICATING THE SMALL OFFICE
4824-36027-0009 HE AS MUCH AS EDWIN WAS A LITTLE TONGUE TIED AND NERVOUS SIT DOWN WILL YOU SAID EDWIN SHUTTING THE DOOR NO TAKE THE ARM CHAIR I'LL ABSQUATULATE ON THE DESK I'D NO IDEA YOU WERE DOWN WHEN DID YOU COME
4824-36027-0010 LAST NIGHT LAST TRAIN JUST A FREAK YOU KNOW
4824-36027-0011 THEY WERE WITHIN A FOOT OF EACH OTHER IN THE EBONISED CUBICLE EDWIN'S LEGS WERE SWINGING A FEW INCHES AWAY FROM THE ARM CHAIR HIS HAT WAS AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND CHARLIE'S HAT WAS AT THE BACK OF CHARLIE'S HEAD
4824-36027-0012 THIS WAS THEIR SOLE POINT OF RESEMBLANCE AS EDWIN SURREPTITIOUSLY EXAMINED THE YOUTH WHO HAD ONCE BEEN HIS INTIMATE FRIEND HE EXPERIENCED THE HALF SNEERING AWE OF THE PROVINCIAL FOR THE PROVINCIAL WHO HAS BECOME A LONDONER
4824-36027-0013 CHARLIE WAS CHANGED EVEN HIS ACCENT WAS CHANGED HE AND EDWIN BELONGED TO UTTERLY DIFFERENT WORLDS NOW
4824-36027-0014 THEY SELDOM SAW THE SAME SCENES OR THOUGHT THE SAME THINGS BUT OF COURSE THEY WERE OBLIGED BY LOYALTY TO THE PAST TO PRETEND THAT NOTHING WAS CHANGED YOU'VE NOT ALTERED MUCH SAID EDWIN
4824-36027-0015 AND INDEED WHEN CHARLIE SMILED HE WAS ALMOST PRECISELY THE OLD SUNDAY DESPITE HIS METROPOLITAN MANNERISMS
4824-36027-0016 AND THERE WAS NOTHING WHATEVER IN HIS FIGURE OR DEPORTMENT TO SHOW THAT HE HAD LIVED FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN FRANCE AND COULD CHATTER IN A LANGUAGE WHOSE VERBS HAD FOUR CONJUGATIONS AFTER ALL HE WAS LESS FORMIDABLE THAN EDWIN MIGHT HAVE ANTICIPATED
4824-36027-0017 I SUPPOSE YOU'VE GOT THIS PLACE PRACTICALLY IN YOUR OWN HANDS NOW SAID CHARLIE I WISH I WAS ON MY OWN I CAN TELL YOU THAT AN INSTINCTIVE GESTURE FROM EDWIN MADE CHARLIE LOWER HIS VOICE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE
4824-36027-0018 THE CUBICLE HAD THE APPEARANCE BUT NOT THE REALITY OF BEING PRIVATE DON'T YOU MAKE ANY MISTAKE EDWIN MURMURED HE WHO DEPENDED ON HIS AUNT'S GENEROSITY FOR CLOTHES THE PRACTICAL RULER OF THE PLACE
4824-36027-0019 STILL HE WAS GLAD THAT CHARLIE SUPPOSED THAT HE RULED EVEN THOUGH THE SUPPOSITION MIGHT BE MERE SMALL TALK YOU'RE IN THAT HOSPITAL AREN'T YOU BART'S BART'S IS IT YES I REMEMBER I EXPECT YOU AREN'T THINKING OF SETTLING DOWN HERE
4824-36027-0020 CHARLIE WAS ABOUT TO REPLY IN ACCENTS OF DISDAIN NOT ME BUT HIS NATURAL POLITENESS STAYED HIS TONGUE I HARDLY THINK SO HE SAID TOO MUCH COMPETITION HERE SO THERE IS EVERYWHERE FOR THE MATTER OF THAT
4824-36027-0021 THE DISILLUSIONS OF THE YOUNG DOCTOR WERE ALREADY UPON CHARLIE AND YET PEOPLE MAY BE FOUND WHO WILL ASSERT THAT IN THOSE DAYS THERE WAS NO COMPETITION THAT COMPETITION HAS BEEN INVENTED DURING THE PAST TEN YEARS YOU NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT COMPETITION SAID EDWIN
4824-36027-0022 WHY NOT WHY NOT MAN NOTHING COULD EVER STOP YOU FROM GETTING PATIENTS WITH THAT SMILE YOU'LL SIMPLY WALK STRAIGHT INTO ANYTHING YOU WANT YOU THINK SO CHARLIE AFFECTED AN IRONIC INCREDULITY BUT HE WAS PLEASED
4824-36027-0023 HE HAD MET THE SAME THEORY IN LONDON WELL YOU DIDN'T SUPPOSE DEGREES AND THINGS HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT DID YOU SAID EDWIN SMILING A LITTLE SUPERIORLY HE FELT WITH PLEASURE THAT HE WAS STILL OLDER THAN THE SUNDAY
4824-36027-0024 AND IT PLEASED HIM ALSO TO BE ABLE THUS TO UTILISE IDEAS WHICH HE HAD FORMED FROM OBSERVATION BUT WHICH BY DIFFIDENCE AND LACK OF OPPORTUNITY HE HAD NEVER EXPRESSED
4824-36027-0025 ALL A PATIENT WANTS IS TO BE SMILED AT IN THE RIGHT WAY HE CONTINUED GROWING BOLDER JUST LOOK AT EM LOOK AT WHO THE DOCTORS HERE HE DROPPED HIS VOICE FURTHER
4824-36027-0026 YOU SEEM TO GO ABOUT NOTICING THINGS ANY CHARGE EDWIN BLUSHED AND LAUGHED THEIR NERVOUSNESS WAS DISSIPATED EACH WAS REASSURED OF THE OLD BASIS OF DECENCY IN THE OTHER
4824-36027-0027 LOOK HERE SAID CHARLIE I CAN'T STOP NOW HOLD ON A BIT I ONLY CALLED TO TELL YOU THAT YOU'VE SIMPLY GOT TO COME UP TO NIGHT COME UP WHERE TO OUR PLACE YOU'VE SIMPLY GOT TO
4824-36027-0028 THE SECRET FACT WAS THAT EDWIN HAD ONCE MORE BEEN UNDER DISCUSSION IN THE HOUSE OF THE ORGREAVES AND OSMOND ORGREAVE HAD LENT JANET A SHILLING SO THAT SHE MIGHT BET CHARLIE A SHILLING THAT HE WOULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING EDWIN TO THE HOUSE
4824-36027-0029 THE UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT IF JANET WON HER FATHER WAS TO TAKE SIXPENCE OF THE GAIN
4824-36027-0030 HE WAS SO EASY TO APPROACH AND SO DIFFICULT TO CATCH JANET WAS SLIGHTLY PIQUED AS FOR EDWIN HE WAS POSTPONING THE EXECUTION OF ALL HIS GOOD RESOLUTIONS UNTIL HE SHOULD BE INSTALLED IN THE NEW HOUSE
4824-36027-0031 HE COULD NOT ACHIEVE HIGHLY DIFFICULT TASKS UNDER CONDITIONS OF EXPECTANCY AND DERANGEMENT THE WHOLE CLAYHANGER PREMISES WERE IN A SUPPRESSED STATE OF BEING PACKED UP IN A WEEK THE REMOVAL WOULD OCCUR
4824-36027-0032 UNTIL THE REMOVAL WAS OVER AND THE NEW ORDER WAS ESTABLISHED EDWIN FELT THAT HE COULD STILL CONSCIENTIOUSLY ALLOW HIS TIMIDITY TO GOVERN HIM AND SO HE HAD REMAINED IN HIS SHELL
4824-36027-0033 THE SOLE HERALD OF THE NEW ORDER WAS THE NEW SUIT OH I CAN'T COME NOT TO NIGHT WHY NOT WE'RE SO BUSY BOSH TO THAT SOME OTHER NIGHT NO I'M GOING BACK TO MORROW MUST
4824-36027-0034 NOW LOOK HERE OLD MAN COME ON I SHALL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED IF YOU DON'T EDWIN WONDERED WHY HE COULD NOT ACCEPT AND BE DONE WITH IT INSTEAD OF PERSISTING IN A SEQUENCE OF INSINCERE AND EVEN LYING HESITATIONS BUT HE COULD NOT
4824-36027-0035 THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID CHARLIE AS IF CLINCHING THE AFFAIR THEN HE LOWERED HIS VOICE TO A SCARCE AUDIBLE CONFIDENTIAL WHISPER FINE GIRL STAYING UP THERE JUST NOW HIS EYES SPARKLED OH AT YOUR PLACE
4824-36027-0036 EDWIN ADOPTED THE SAME CAUTIOUS TONE STIFFORD OUTSIDE STRAINED HIS EARS IN VAIN THE MAGIC WORD GIRL HAD IN AN INSTANT THROWN THE SHOP INTO AGITATION THE SHOP WAS NO LONGER PROVINCIAL
4824-36027-0037 IT BECAME A PART OF THE UNIVERSAL YES HAVEN'T YOU SEEN HER ABOUT NO WHO IS SHE OH FRIEND OF JANET'S HILDA LESSWAYS HER NAME IS I DON'T KNOW MUCH OF HER MYSELF BIT OF ALL RIGHT IS SHE
4824-36027-0038 EDWIN TRIED IN A WHISPER TO BE A MAN OF VAST EXPERIENCE AND SETTLED VIEWS HE TRIED TO WHISPER AS THOUGH HE WHISPERED ABOUT WOMEN EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE HE THOUGHT THAT THESE LONDONERS WERE TERRIFIC ON THE SUBJECT OF WOMEN AND HE DID HIS BEST TO REACH THEIR LEVEL
4824-36027-0039 HE SUCCEEDED SO WELL THAT CHARLIE WHO AS A MAN KNEW MORE OF LONDON THAN OF THE PROVINCES THOUGHT THAT AFTER ALL LONDON WAS NOTHING IN COMPARISON TO THE SEEMING QUIET PROVINCES
4824-36027-0040 CHARLIE LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR DREW DOWN THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH NODDED HIS HEAD KNOWINGLY AND THEN QUITE SPOILED THE DESIRED EFFECT OF DOGGISHNESS BY HIS DELIGHTFULLY CANDID SMILE
4824-36027-0041 NEITHER OF THEM HAD THE LEAST INTENTION OF DISRESPECT TOWARDS THE FINE GIRL WHO WAS ON THEIR LIPS
4824-36027-0042 EDWIN SAID TO HIMSELF
4824-36027-0043 HE THOUGHT ENVIOUSLY OF CHARLIE AS A FREE BIRD OF THE AIR WHAT'S SHE LIKE EDWIN INQUIRED YOU COME UP AND SEE CHARLIE RETORTED NOT TO NIGHT SAID THE FAWN IN SPITE OF EDWIN
4824-36027-0044 YOU COME TO NIGHT OR I PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT SAID CHARLIE IN HIS NATURAL VOICE THIS PHRASE FROM THEIR SCHOOL DAYS MADE THEM BOTH LAUGH AGAIN THEY WERE NOW APPARENTLY AS INTIMATE AS EVER THEY HAD BEEN ALL RIGHT SAID EDWIN I'LL COME SURE
4824-36027-0045 YES COME FOR A SORT OF SUPPER AT EIGHT OH EDWIN DREW BACK SUPPER
4824-36027-0046 THEY STOOD A MOMENT TOGETHER AT THE DOOR OF THE SHOP IN THE DECLINING WARMTH OF THE SUMMER AFTERNOON MUTUALLY SATISFIED SO LONG
4824-36027-0047 THE SUNDAY ELEGANTLY DEPARTED EDWIN HAD GIVEN HIS WORD AND HE FELT AS HE MIGHT HAVE FELT HAD SURGEONS JUST TIED HIM TO THE OPERATING TABLE
4824-36027-0048 NEVERTHELESS HE WAS NOT ILL PLEASED WITH HIS OWN DEMEANOUR IN FRONT OF CHARLIE AND HE LIKED CHARLIE AS MUCH AS EVER HE SHOULD RELY ON CHARLIE AS A SUPPORT DURING THIS ADVENTURE INTO THE WORLDLY REGIONS PEOPLED BY FINE GIRLS
4824-36027-0049 HE PICTURED THIS HILDA AS BEING MORE ROMANTIC AND STRANGE THAN JANET ORGREAVE HE PICTURED HER AS MYSTERIOUSLY SUPERIOR AND HE WAS AFRAID OF HIS OWN IMAGE OF HER AT TEA IN THE DISMANTLED SITTING ROOM
4824-36027-0050 THOUGH HE WAS GOING OUT TO SUPPER HE ATE QUITE AS MUCH TEA AS USUAL FROM SHEER POLTROONERY HE SAID AS CASUALLY AS HE COULD BY THE WAY CHARLIE ORGREAVE CALLED THIS AFTERNOON DID HE SAID MAGGIE
4824-36027-0051 HE'S OFF BACK TO LONDON TO MORROW HE WOULD HAVE ME SLIP UP THERE TO NIGHT TO SEE HIM AND SHALL YOU I THINK SO SAID EDWIN WITH AN APPEARANCE OF INDECISION I MAY AS WELL IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THERE HAD EVER BEEN QUESTION OF HIM VISITING A PRIVATE HOUSE
4824-36027-0052 EXCEPT HIS AUNT'S AT NIGHT TO HIM THE MOMENT MARKED AN EPOCH THE INCEPTION OF FREEDOM BUT THE PHLEGMATIC MAGGIE SHOWED NO SIGN OF EXCITEMENT
