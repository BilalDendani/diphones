7700-92919-0000 DANTE IN THE YEAR TWELVE SIXTY FIVE THERE WAS BORN IN THE CITY OF FLORENCE IN ITALY A MAN WHO WAS DESTINED TO BECOME ONE OF THE FOUR GREATEST POETS THAT THE WORLD HAS EVER PRODUCED THIS MAN WAS DANTE
7700-92919-0001 THE SON OF ALIGHIERO A FLORENTINE WHO WAS POPULAR AND WELL KNOWN AS A MAN OF AFFAIRS WHEN DANTE WAS BORN ITALY WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT IS TO DAY FOR INSTEAD OF BEING FORMED OF A SINGLE NATION
7700-92919-0002 THE CITIES THEMSELVES WERE NATIONS AND MADE THEIR OWN LAWS THESE CITIES MOREOVER WERE CONSTANTLY AT WAR WITH ONE ANOTHER AND FIGHTING WAS THE ORDER OF THE DAY EVEN WITHIN THE CITIES THERE WERE OFTEN BLOODY FRAYS AND BRAWLS
7700-92919-0003 BETWEEN THE SUPPORTERS OF ONE OR ANOTHER NOBLE FAMILY THESE BRAWLS SOMETIMES BECAME SO EXTENSIVE THAT THEY GREW INTO CIVIL WAR AND PENETRATED BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE CITIES IN WHICH THEY WERE HATCHED
7700-92919-0004 SUCH WAS THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN DANTE'S TIME AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THIS
7700-92919-0005 HAD A GREAT EFFECT UPON HIS LIFE PARTICULARLY LONG AND BLOODY IN FLORENCE AND OTHER CITIES HAD BEEN THE STRIFE BETWEEN TWO FAMILIES AND FACTIONS WHO CALLED THEMSELVES RESPECTIVELY THE GUELFS AND THE GHIBELLINES
7700-92919-0006 AND SUPPORT THEM IN ALL THEIR QUARRELS THE GUELFS MOREOVER WERE HIGH IN THE AFFAIRS OF FLORENCE AND HAD OVERCOME THEIR OPPONENTS THERE AND FOR THIS REASON THOSE WHO BELONGED TO THE GUELF CAUSE HAD THE CHANCE TO RISE IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE CITY SO
7700-92919-0007 DANTE'S BOYHOOD WAS NOT SPENT LIKE THAT OF SOME OTHER POETS IN THE MIDST OF BOOKS ALONE OR IN THE QUIET SECLUSION OF SCHOOL AND COLLEGE HE WAS THROWN NECK AND HEELS INTO THE MIDST OF THE FIERY ITALIAN POLITICS
7700-92919-0008 AND GO UNPUNISHED PROVIDING
7700-92919-0009 AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE SAW MANY WILD DOINGS HE WAS HOWEVER OF STUDIOUS HABITS AND LOVED READING MORE THAN THE AIR HE BREATHED AND WHILE LITTLE IS KNOWN OF HIS BOYHOOD YEARS IT IS CERTAIN THAT HE MASTERED THEN AND IN HIS EARLY MANHOOD
7700-92919-0010 MANY OF THE BEST BOOKS THAT HAD BEEN WRITTEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD MOREOVER AS DANTE LATER SAID HE HAD TAUGHT HIMSELF THE ART OF BRINGING WORDS INTO VERSE AN ART THAT HE MASTERED SO THOROUGHLY THAT HIS NAME WAS TO LIVE FOREVER
7700-92919-0011 WHEN DANTE WAS STILL A YOUNG BOY THERE BEFELL SOMETHING THAT PROVED TO BE THE MOST WONDERFUL HAPPENING IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE THIS WAS NOTHING ELSE THAN MEETING A LITTLE GIRL NAMED BEATRICE PORTINARI ALTHOUGH BEATRICE WAS ONLY A CHILD AND
7700-92919-0012 DANTE HIMSELF HARDLY TEN YEARS OLD HE FELT A LOVE FOR HER THAT LASTED FROM THAT MINUTE UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEATH AND THAT INSPIRED HIM TO WRITE THE GREAT POEM THAT MADE HIS NAME FAMOUS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD A FESTIVAL WAS GIVEN BY THE FAMILY OF THE PORTINARI
7700-92919-0013 WHICH WAS A NOBLE ONE AND POSSESSED SUCH WEALTH THAT ITS MEMBERS AFTERWARD BECAME BANKERS FOR KING EDWARD THE THIRD OF ENGLAND AMONG THE GUESTS WAS THE BOY DANTE AND HE BEHELD BEATRICE THERE AS A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRL
7700-92919-0014 HOW STRANGELY HE WAS AFFECTED BY THE SIGHT OF HER HE TOLD IN LATER YEARS AND HIS WORDS HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED AND QUOTED AS FOLLOWS HER DRESS ON THAT DAY SAID DANTE
7700-92919-0015 A SUBDUED AND GOODLY CRIMSON GIRDLED AND ADORNED IN SUCH SORT AS BEST SUITED HER VERY TENDER AGE
7700-92919-0016 BEGAN TO TREMBLE SO VIOLENTLY THAT THE LEAST PULSES OF MY BODY SHOOK THEREWITH FROM THAT TIME LOVE RULED MY SOUL DANTE DID NOT SPEAK TO BEATRICE ON THAT OCCASION IN FACT HE SAW HER
7700-92919-0017 OR ADDRESSED HER ONLY TWO OR THREE TIMES IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE BUT FROM THE DAY WHEN SHE FIRST APPEARED TO HIM IN HER CRIMSON DRESS HE SOUGHT TO PERFORM SOME DEED THAT WOULD MAKE HIM WORTHY OF HER LOVE AND THE RESULT WAS THE GREAT POEM IN WHICH HE PLACED HER NAME
7700-92919-0018 BESIDE HIS OWN IN SPITE OF HIS LOVE DANTE DID NOT BECOME AN IDLE DREAMER BUT DEVELOPED INTO AN ACTIVE AND STUDIOUS YOUNG MAN READY TO TAKE UP THE SWORD TO DEFEND HIS CITY WHENEVER IT MIGHT CALL ON HIM TO DO SO
7700-92919-0019 AND WHEN HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD HE PUT ON HIS ARMOR AND WENT FORTH TO BATTLE AGAINST THE CITIZENS OF AREZZO A TOWN WHERE THE GHIBELLINES WERE POWERFUL AND HAD BEEN ACTING IN A HOSTILE MANNER TOWARD THE GUELFS WHO CONTROLLED FLORENCE
7700-92919-0020 WAR WAS NOT SO SERIOUS AN AFFAIR THEN AS IT IS NOW AND EVERYONE ENGAGED IN IT MOREOVER THE TOWNS THAT WARRED AGAINST EACH OTHER WERE SO NEAR THAT IT WAS SOMETIMES AN EASY MATTER TO GO FORTH AND FIGHT ON ONE DAY
7700-92919-0021 EVERYONE WAS EXPECTED TO BEAR ARMS FOR HIS CITY AND GOING TO WAR WAS HELD TO BE A MATTER OF COURSE BUT IN SPITE OF THESE THINGS DANTE GAINED GREAT PRAISE FOR THE WAY IN WHICH HE CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN THE WAR WITH AREZZO PERHAPS BECAUSE HE WAS BRAVER THAN THE REST
7700-92919-0022 OR PERHAPS BECAUSE A POET IS NOT GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE AS WARLIKE AS OTHER MEN AFTER THE FIGHTING HAD ENDED DANTE RETURNED TO FLORENCE AND PREPARED TO TAKE HIS PART IN CITY POLITICS
7700-92919-0023 BEFORE HE COULD ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING IT WAS NECESSARY FOR HIM TO GO ON RECORD THAT HE BELONGED TO ONE OF THE GREAT GUILDS INTO WHICH ALL THE CITIZENS AT THAT TIME WERE DIVIDED AND WHICH CONTROLLED ALL THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF BUSINESS AND MANUFACTURING
7700-92919-0024 AND ALL THE SCIENCES SO DANTE ENTERED THE GUILD OF THE DOCTORS AND APOTHECARIES NOT BECAUSE HE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR PROFESSIONS THAT WAS NOT NECESSARY BUT TO GIVE HIMSELF AN APPARENT VOCATION
7700-92919-0025 BY THIS TIME DANTE'S GREAT INTELLECT AND SCHOLARLY ATTAINMENTS HAD MADE HIM WELL KNOWN IN FLORENCE ALTHOUGH HE WAS ONLY A YOUNG MAN HE WAS HIGH IN THE ESTEEM OF MANY LEARNED MEN AND HAD A GREAT MANY POETS AND ARTISTS FOR HIS FRIENDS
7700-92919-0026 SO WELL DID HE APPEAR IN THEIR EYES AND TO THE MEN OF THE CITY OF FLORENCE WHO RAN ITS AFFAIRS THAT IN THE YEAR THIRTEEN HUNDRED DANTE WAS MADE ONE OF THE PRIORS OF FLORENCE THAT IS ONE OF THE CHIEF RULERS OF THE CITY
7700-92919-0027 WITHOUT MAKING MANY ENEMIES AND AS DANTE BELONGED TO THE CONTROLLING FACTION OTHERS WHO WERE NOT IN POWER PLANNED HIS OVERTHROW AND THAT OF HIS FELLOW RULERS
7700-92919-0028 DANTE HIMSELF HOWEVER DISLIKED THIS CIVIL STRIFE AND DID ALL IN HIS POWER TO BRING THE OPPOSING FACTIONS TOGETHER BUT HIS ENEMIES GOT THE UPPER HAND
7700-92919-0029 BEATRICE WHOM HE STILL CONTINUED TO LOVE ARDENTLY ALTHOUGH HE HAD MARRIED A GOOD WOMAN NAMED GEMMA DONATI AND HAD THREE CHILDREN HAD DIED SOME YEARS BEFORE LEAVING HIM NOTHING BUT HER MEMORY
7700-92919-0030 BUT DANTE'S LOVE FOR BEATRICE HAD NOT INTERFERED IN HIS RELATIONS WITH HIS WIFE IT WAS NOT AN EARTHLY LOVE HE HAD NOT WANTED BEATRICE AS HIS WIFE BUT RATHER AS AN IDEAL THAT HE COULD WORSHIP AND AFTER HER DEATH
7700-92919-0031 HE BECAME BOTH GLOOMY AND UNHAPPY HIS EXILE MOREOVER WAS A BITTER BLOW TO DANTE FOR HE HAD LOVED FLORENCE DEARLY AND COULD NOT IMAGINE MAKING HIS HOME ELSEWHERE WITH BITTERNESS IN HIS HEART
7700-92919-0032 HE WANDERED FROM CITY TO CITY AND THEN HE SET OUT IN EARNEST TO WRITE THE GREAT POEM WHICH IS CALLED THE DIVINE COMEDY DANTE HAD ALREADY WRITTEN A NUMBER OF BEAUTIFUL POEMS BUT THEY WERE MORE IN THE STYLE OF OTHER ITALIAN AND LATIN POETRY
7700-92919-0033 WHAT HE NOW PLANNED WAS ENTIRELY NEW AND SO DARING THAT IT HAD NEVER BEEN THOUGHT OF SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD HE PLANNED IN THIS POEM TO DESCRIBE A JOURNEY INTO THE NETHERMOST REGIONS OF HELL THEN INTO PURGATORY
7700-92919-0034 AND FINALLY INTO HEAVEN WHERE BEATRICE SHOULD BE HIS GUIDE AND CONDUCT HIM TO THE THRONE OF GOD HIMSELF SUCH A POEM AS WE HAVE SAID HAD NEVER BEEN WRITTEN OR EVEN WILDLY IMAGINED
7700-92919-0035 AND HE TOLD THE STORY OF THE POEM AS THOUGH THE ADVENTURES IN IT WERE REAL AND HAD HAPPENED DIRECTLY TO HIMSELF HELL ACCORDING TO DANTE'S BELIEF
7700-92919-0036 WAS A GIGANTIC FUNNEL SHAPED GULF DIRECTLY BENEATH THE CITY OF JERUSALEM SHAPED INTO NINE VAST CIRCLES OR PITS WITH A COMMON CENTER THAT REACHED DOWN TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH LIKE A CIRCULAR FLIGHT OF STAIRS
7700-92919-0037 IN THE LOWEST PIT OF ALL SATAN HIMSELF WAS TO BE FOUND RULING HIS KINGDOM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EARTH WAS A WIDE SEA FROM WHICH AROSE A MIGHTY MOUNTAIN CALLED THE MOUNT OF PURGATORY
7700-92919-0038 THE PLACE WHERE THE SOULS OF HUMAN BEINGS DID PENANCE FOR THEIR SINS UNTIL THEY WERE FIT TO ENTER HEAVEN HEAVEN ITSELF WAS COMPOSED OF NINE TRANSPARENT AND REVOLVING SPHERES THAT ENCLOSED THE EARTH
7700-92919-0039 AND IN WHICH WERE FASTENED THE SUN THE MOON AND THE STARS THE MOTION OF THESE HEAVENLY BODIES AS THEY ROSE AND SET ABOVE THE EARTH'S HORIZON WAS BELIEVED BY DANTE TO BE DUE TO THE TURNING OF THE SPHERES WHICH WERE MOVED BY THE HAND OF GOD
7700-92919-0040 IT WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS IDEA OF HEAVEN AND HELL THAT DANTE BEGAN HIS POEM ONE DAY HE SAID WHEN HE WAS LONELY AND SAD IN SPIRIT HE FOUND HIMSELF STANDING IN THE MIDST OF A DEEP FOREST THAT WAS SO GLOOMY
7700-92919-0041 WILD AND SAVAGE THAT NO MORTAL EYES HAD EVER SEEN ITS EQUAL AND EVEN TO THINK OF IT AFTERWARD CAUSED HIM A BITTERNESS NOT FAR FROM THAT OF DEATH ITSELF AS HE STOOD THERE HE WAS AWARE OF A PRESENCE CLOSE BY
7700-92919-0042 THE STATELY FIGURE OF A MAN WHO PROVED TO BE THE GREAT ROMAN POET VERGIL AND VERGIL TOLD HIM THAT DIVINE WILL HAD ORDERED HIM TO GUIDE DANTE THROUGH HELL AND AS FAR AS THE GATES OF PARADISE
7700-92919-0043 AND HAD BEEN DECREED BY HEAVEN ITSELF AND DANTE IN GREAT FEAR AT WHAT HE WAS ABOUT TO SEE WAS LED BY VERGIL THROUGH THE FOREST UNTIL HE CAME TO THE MOUTH OF A BLACK CAVERN
7700-92919-0044 WAS A VERSE THAT TOLD DANTE THAT HERE WAS THE ENTRANCE TO THE LOWER WORLD THE GATEWAY TO HELL AND THE VERSE CONCLUDED WITH THE GRIM WORDS ALL HOPE
7700-92919-0045 SIGHS GROANS LAMENTATIONS AND TERRIBLE VOICES WERE HEARD FROM THE DEPTHS BELOW AS THEY PASSED THROUGH THIS EVIL DOORWAY AND NOW THEY WERE IN A REGION OF MURKY GLOOM WHERE NO RAY OF SUNLIGHT EVER HAD ENTERED
7700-92919-0046 ALL AROUND THEM WERE THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD THEY CAME FLOCKING TO THE ACHERON OR RIVER OF DEATH
7700-92919-0047 WITH EYES LIKE FLAMING WHEELS BORE THEM ACROSS
7700-92919-0048 HE STERNLY ORDERED DANTE TO RETURN WHENCE HE HAD COME VERGIL INTERCEDED FOR HIM AND THEY PASSED ON AFTER THEY HAD CROSSED THE RIVER OF DEATH THEY ENTERED THE FIRST CIRCLE OF HELL
7700-92919-0049 WHERE THOSE WHO HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO DIE WITHOUT BEING BAPTIZED OR WHO HAD BELIEVED IN SOME OTHER RELIGION THAN CHRISTIANITY MUST SPEND THE REST OF TIME HERE WERE A NUMBER OF NOBLE SPIRITS FROM THE DAYS OF ROME AND GREECE
7700-92919-0050 INCLUDING MANY OF THE POETS MATHEMATICIANS AND ASTRONOMERS OF OLDEN DAYS DANTE WOULD GLADLY HAVE REMAINED WITH THEM FOR THEY WERE NOT UNHAPPY AND SPENT THEIR TIME IN LEARNED DISCOURSE AND SCHOLARLY FRIENDSHIP BUT VERGIL URGED HIM ONWARD
7700-92919-0051 DEEPER AND DEEPER THEY DESCENDED THEY PASSED THROUGH GREAT SPACES WHERE MIGHTY WINDS SWEPT BEFORE THEM THE SOULS OF THE DEAD
7700-92919-0052 THROUGH REGIONS OF CHILL RAIN AND SLEET WHERE THE SPIRITS OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN GLUTTONOUS IN THEIR LIFETIME WERE PERPETUALLY TORN INTO PIECES BY A THREE HEADED DOG
7700-92919-0053 AND AFTER MANY AWFUL SCENES THAT DANTE COULD HARDLY BEAR TO WITNESS HE SAW IN FRONT OF HIM
7700-92919-0054 OR SATAN IN WHICH THE SPIRITS OF THE DAMNED UNDERWENT PUNISHMENTS
7700-92919-0055 GUARDING THE WALLS WERE THE THREE FURIES OF THE GREEK LEGENDS WHEN THEY BEHELD DANTE THEY HOWLED FOR THE GORGON MEDUSA WITH THE SNAKY LOCKS TO COME QUICKLY AND TURN HIM INTO STONE
7700-92919-0056 A FATE THAT MUST BEFALL ALL MEN THAT GAZED UPON HER FACE BUT VERGIL BADE DANTE HIDE HIS EYES AND TO BE SURE THAT HE MIGHT BE SAVED HE COVERED THEM WITH HIS OWN HAND THEY ENTERED THE CITY
7700-92919-0057 THAT WE SHALL NOT DESCRIBE THEM HERE
7700-92919-0058 THAT STROVE TO ARREST THEIR PROGRESS AND IN PASSING BY A LAKE OF BURNING PITCH IN WHICH TORTURED SOULS WERE BURNING THE DEMONS THAT GUARDED THEM RUSHED AT DANTE AND PURSUED HIM EAGER TO HURL HIM INTO THE LAKE
7700-92919-0059 TO LOSE HIS LIFE AND THE HOPE OF HEAVEN AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME LOWER AND LOWER THEY DESCENDED PASSING FROM ONE HORROR TO ANOTHER STILL MORE TERRIBLE UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE NETHERMOST PIT OF ALL
7700-92919-0060 WHERE VERGIL TOLD DANTE THAT NOW HE WOULD NEED ALL HIS COURAGE TO SUSTAIN HIM FOR HE HAD COME AT LAST TO THE ABODE OF SATAN THIS WAS A REGION OF ETERNAL ICE AND A BITTER WIND BLEW ON THEM
7700-92919-0061 SO COLD AND DREADFUL THAT DANTE WAS HALF DEAD FROM IT AND IT SEEMED THAT HIS NUMBED SENSES COULD NOT SUPPORT LIFE ANY LONGER THE WIND HE SAW WAS CAUSED BY THE BAT LIKE WINGS OF SATAN HIMSELF
7700-92919-0062 A GIGANTIC AND HAIRY MONSTER WITH ONLY THE UPPER HALF OF HIS BODY PROTRUDING FROM THE ICY PIT IN WHICH HE STOOD HE HAD THREE HEADS ONE RED
7700-92919-0063 AND IN HIS THREE MOUTHS HE MUNCHED THE THREE GREATEST TRAITORS OF ALL TIME JUDAS ISCARIOT BRUTUS AND CASSIUS WHEN DANTE WAS ABOUT TO SWOON FROM THE TERRIBLE SIGHT VERGIL WATCHED HIS OPPORTUNITY
7700-92919-0064 AND AS THE GREAT WINGS OF SATAN ROSE HE SPRANG BENEATH THEM WITH DANTE FOLLOWING HIM GRASPING THE HAIRY SIDE OF THE MONSTER THEY COMMENCED TO DESCEND STILL LOWER AND SOON TO DANTE'S AMAZEMENT THEIR DOWNWARD PATH BECAME AN UPWARD ONE
7700-92919-0065 FOR SATAN'S WAIST WAS AT THE CENTER OF THE EARTH AND AFTER THEY HAD PASSED IT THEY MUST CLIMB INSTEAD OF DESCEND UP AND UP THEY WENT TOILING WITH THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY
7700-92919-0066 PASSING THROUGH A CHIMNEY LIKE PASSAGEWAY THAT LED FOR AN INCREDIBLE DISTANCE TO THE OPEN AIR ABOVE AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED BENEATH THE BLUE SKY THEY WERE AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN OF PURGATORY WHERE MEN'S SPIRITS THAT WERE NOT DOOMED TO HELL
7700-92919-0067 MUST PURIFY THEMSELVES BEFORE THEY COULD HOPE TO ENTER THE HEAVEN THAT LAY ABOVE THEM AFTER THE SOOT OF HELL WAS WASHED FROM DANTE'S COUNTENANCE HE BEGAN WITH VERGIL TO ASCEND THE MOUNTAIN THEY PASSED COUNTLESS SPIRITS
7700-92919-0068 ALL ENGAGED IN SEVERE TASKS TO CLEANSE THEMSELVES OF SIN BEFORE THEY COULD HOPE TO ATTAIN THE WONDERFUL REGIONS ABOVE BUT THESE SPIRITS WERE ALMOST HAPPY ALTHOUGH MANY OF THEM WERE UNDERGOING PAIN AND SUFFERING
7700-92919-0069 FOR THEIR TROUBLE WAS NOT ENDLESS AS WAS THE CASE WITH THE SPIRITS OF HELL AND THEY WOULD CERTAINLY FIND HAPPINESS AT LAST WHEN THEY CAME TO THE SUMMIT OF THE MOUNTAIN A WALL OF FIRE LAY BETWEEN THEM AND PARADISE THROUGH THIS THEY PASSED AND ONCE ON THE OTHER SIDE
7700-92919-0070 DANTE LOST SIGHT OF VERGIL WHO COULD ACCOMPANY HIM NO FURTHER DANTE WAS THEN GREETED BY HIS LONG LOST BEATRICE NOW A RADIANT SPIRIT WHO HAD BEEN CHOSEN BY DIVINE WILL TO SHOW HIM THE GLORIES OF HEAVEN AND WITH BEATRICE GUIDING HIM
7700-92919-0071 DANTE PASSED UPWARD THROUGH THE CRYSTAL SPHERES ONCE GETTING A GLIMPSE OF THE EARTH IN HIS HEAVENLY PROGRESS AS IT LAY BENEATH HIM SHINING IN THE LIGHT OF THE SUN AT LAST DANTE HAD ASCENDED TO SO GREAT A HEIGHT IN HEAVEN
7700-92919-0072 THAT HE BEHELD GOD HIMSELF BUT WHAT HE SAW WAS SO WONDERFUL THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO WRITE ABOUT IT AND IN THIS WAY HIS WONDERFUL POEM CAME TO AN END AFTER COMPLETING THE INFERNO DANTE WENT TO PARIS
7700-92919-0073 WHERE HE MET A GREAT MANY SCHOLARS AND WISE MEN WHO TREATED HIM WITH THE UTMOST RESPECT BUT ALL THE TIME HE DESIRED TO BE IN HIS NATIVE CITY OF FLORENCE WHEN HENRY OF LUXEMBOURG PLANNED TO LAY SIEGE TO IT DANTE ENCOURAGED HIM
7700-92919-0074 HOPING THAT HE MIGHT ENTER WITH THE CONQUERORS AND THAT HIS ENEMIES MIGHT BE OVERTHROWN THE SIEGE TOOK PLACE BUT IT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL AND THE POET WAS COMPELLED TO WANDER FAR AND WIDE AMONG STRANGERS FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
7700-92919-0075 AS HE LACKED MONEY HE HAD TO TAKE MANY HUMBLE OFFICES TO EARN HIS BREAD AND MORE THAN ONCE HAD TO UNDERGO THE INDIGNITY OF SITTING AMONG THE JESTERS AND BUFFOONS AT SOME GREAT HOUSE THAT HAD HONORED HIM WITH ITS FAVOR
7700-92919-0076 AT LAST WEARY OF LIFE AND SICK AT HEART DANTE WENT TO RAVENNA WHERE HIS GENIUS WAS HONORED MORE WORTHILY HIS NAME HAD NOW PENETRATED THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD
7700-92919-0077 AND HE WAS KNOWN AS ONE OF THE GREATEST GENIUSES THAT HAD EVER LIVED MANY PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT DANTE HAD ACTUALLY BEHELD THE SCENES THAT HE DESCRIBED WHEN THEY MET HIM ON THE STREETS THEY WOULD DRAW ASIDE TO LET HIM PASS
7700-92919-0078 THINKING HIM A MAN WHOSE DESTINY WAS DIFFERENT FROM THEIR OWN AND THEY WOULD WHISPER TO EACH OTHER THAT HE WAS THE MAN WHO HAD DESCENDED INTO HELL AND COME FORTH AGAIN ALIVE AND HAD LOOKED WITH HIS OWN EYES AT THE HORRORS OF THE INFERNAL REGIONS
7700-92919-0079 NO DOUBT THE FAME AND THE ALMOST FRIGHTENED HOMAGE THAT HE RECEIVED WERE PLEASING TO THE SAD SOUL OF DANTE BUT HE ALWAYS REMEMBERED THAT HE WAS STILL AN OUTCAST FROM HIS NATIVE CITY FLORENCE STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO REMOVE HER BAN
7700-92919-0080 AND WHEN DANTE DIED HE WAS BURIED AT RAVENNA THERE HIS BODY STILL LIES WITH A LATIN INSCRIPTION ON HIS TOMBSTONE THAT TELLS THE WORLD OF THE INGRATITUDE OF THE CITY OF FLORENCE
