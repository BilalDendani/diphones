4344-8892-0000 MISS MELBURY WENT OUT FOR A MORNING WALK AND HER EVER REGARDFUL FATHER HAVING AN HOUR'S LEISURE OFFERED TO WALK WITH HER THE BREEZE WAS FRESH AND QUITE STEADY FILTERING ITSELF THROUGH THE DENUDED MASS OF TWIGS WITHOUT SWAYING THEM
4344-8892-0001 BUT MAKING THE POINT OF EACH IVY LEAF ON THE TRUNKS SCRATCH ITS UNDERLYING NEIGHBOR RESTLESSLY GRACE'S LIPS SUCKED IN THIS NATIVE AIR OF HERS LIKE MILK THEY SOON REACHED A PLACE WHERE THE WOOD RAN DOWN INTO A CORNER
4344-8892-0002 AND WENT OUTSIDE IT TOWARDS COMPARATIVELY OPEN GROUND HAVING LOOKED ROUND ABOUT THEY WERE INTENDING TO RE ENTER THE COPSE WHEN A FOX QUIETLY EMERGED WITH A DRAGGING BRUSH TROTTED PAST THEM TAMELY AS A DOMESTIC CAT AND DISAPPEARED AMID SOME DEAD FERN

4344-8892-0011 GRACE SHALL I TELL YOU THE SECRET OF IT
4344-8892-0012 IF A BLACK COATED SQUIRE OR PA'SON HAD BEEN WALKING WITH YOU INSTEAD OF ME
4344-8892-0013 I TELL YOU IT IS THAT I'VE NOTICED AND I'VE NOTICED IT MANY TIMES THAT A WOMAN TAKES HER COLOR FROM THE MAN SHE'S WALKING WITH THE WOMAN WHO LOOKS AN UNQUESTIONABLE LADY WHEN SHE'S WITH A POLISHED UP FELLOW LOOKS A MERE TAWDRY IMITATION ARTICLE WHEN SHE'S HOBBING AND NOBBING WITH A HOMELY BLADE
4344-8892-0014 YOU SHALL HAVE SOMEBODY TO WALK WITH YOU WHO LOOKS MORE OF A DANDY THAN I PLEASE GOD YOU SHALL BUT MY DEAR FATHER SHE SAID MUCH DISTRESSED I DON'T MIND AT ALL I DON'T WISH FOR MORE HONOR THAN I ALREADY HAVE
4344-8892-0015 ACCORDING TO MENANDER OR SOME OLD GREEK POET AND TO NOBODY WAS ONE EVER MORE SO THAN TO MELBURY BY REASON OF HER VERY DEARNESS TO HIM AS FOR GRACE SHE BEGAN TO FEEL TROUBLED
4344-8892-0016 SHE DID NOT PERHAPS WISH THERE AND THEN TO UNAMBITIOUSLY DEVOTE HER LIFE TO GILES WINTERBORNE
4344-8892-0017 DESPITE HER FEELING SHE ASSENTED TO THIS HIS REASONING HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT ITS WEIGHT UPON HER GRACE HE SAID JUST BEFORE THEY HAD REACHED THE HOUSE IF IT COSTS ME MY LIFE YOU SHALL MARRY WELL
4344-8892-0018 TO DAY HAS SHOWN ME THAT WHATEVER A YOUNG WOMAN'S NICENESS SHE STANDS FOR NOTHING ALONE YOU SHALL MARRY WELL HE BREATHED HEAVILY AND HIS BREATHING WAS CAUGHT UP BY THE BREEZE WHICH SEEMED TO SIGH A SOFT REMONSTRANCE SHE LOOKED CALMLY AT HIM
4344-8892-0019 I MENTION IT FATHER NOT AS A MATTER OF SENTIMENT BUT AS A QUESTION OF KEEPING FAITH THE TIMBER MERCHANT'S EYES FELL FOR A MOMENT I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW HE SAID TIS A TRYING STRAIT WELL
4344-8892-0020 WELL THERE'S NO HURRY WE'LL WAIT AND SEE HOW HE GETS ON
4344-8892-0021 IT HAD AT ONE TIME BEEN PART OF THE BAKEHOUSE WITH THE ORDINARY OVAL BRICK OVEN IN THE WALL BUT MISTER MELBURY IN TURNING IT INTO AN OFFICE HAD BUILT INTO THE CAVITY AN IRON SAFE WHICH HE USED FOR HOLDING HIS PRIVATE PAPERS
4344-8892-0022 THE DOOR OF THE SAFE WAS NOW OPEN AND HIS KEYS WERE HANGING FROM IT SIT DOWN GRACE AND KEEP ME COMPANY HE SAID YOU MAY AMUSE YOURSELF BY LOOKING OVER THESE HE THREW OUT A HEAP OF PAPERS BEFORE HER WHAT ARE THEY SHE ASKED
4344-8892-0023 SECURITIES OF VARIOUS SORTS HE UNFOLDED THEM ONE BY ONE PAPERS WORTH SO MUCH MONEY EACH NOW
4344-8892-0024 NO INDEED IF YOU DIDN'T SAY SO TIS SO THEN NOW HERE ARE PAPERS OF ANOTHER SORT THEY ARE FOR DIFFERENT SUMS IN THE THREE PER CENTS NOW THESE ARE PORT BREEDY HARBOR BONDS WE HAVE A GREAT STAKE IN THAT HARBOR YOU KNOW BECAUSE I SEND OFF TIMBER THERE
4344-8892-0025 NONSENSE OPEN THEM NOW YOU OUGHT TO LEARN A LITTLE OF SUCH MATTERS A YOUNG LADY OF EDUCATION SHOULD NOT BE IGNORANT OF MONEY AFFAIRS ALTOGETHER SUPPOSE YOU SHOULD BE LEFT A WIDOW SOME DAY WITH YOUR HUSBAND'S TITLE DEEDS AND INVESTMENTS THROWN UPON YOUR HANDS
4344-8892-0026 IT DOES NOT COME TO THAT I HAVE TITLE DEEDS MYSELF THERE THAT PIECE OF PARCHMENT REPRESENTS HOUSES IN SHERTON ABBAS YES BUT SHE HESITATED LOOKED AT THE FIRE AND WENT ON IN A LOW VOICE
4344-8892-0027 IF WHAT HAS BEEN ARRANGED ABOUT ME SHOULD COME TO ANYTHING MY SPHERE WILL BE QUITE A MIDDLING ONE YOUR SPHERE OUGHT NOT TO BE MIDDLING HE EXCLAIMED NOT IN PASSION BUT IN EARNEST CONVICTION
4344-8892-0028 WHEN SHE SHOWED YOU HER HOUSE AND ALL HER KNICK KNACKS AND MADE YOU STAY TO TEA SO NICELY IN HER DRAWING ROOM SURELY YOU DID YES I DID SAY SO ADMITTED GRACE WAS IT TRUE YES I FELT SO AT THE TIME
4344-8892-0029 THE FEELING IS LESS STRONG NOW PERHAPS AH NOW THOUGH YOU DON'T SEE IT YOUR FEELING AT THE TIME WAS THE RIGHT ONE BECAUSE YOUR MIND AND BODY WERE JUST IN FULL AND FRESH CULTIVATION SO THAT GOING THERE WITH HER WAS LIKE MEETING LIKE
4344-8892-0030 AND SO YOU DON'T FEEL YOUR PLACE SO STRONGLY
4344-8892-0031 PERHAPS WHEN YOUR EDUCATION IS BACKED UP BY WHAT THESE PAPERS REPRESENT
4344-8892-0032 THOUGH IN DIRECT ANTAGONISM TO A BETTER FEELING WHICH HAD HITHERTO PREVAILED WITH HIM AND HAD INDEED ONLY SUCCUMBED THAT MORNING DURING THE RAMBLE SHE WISHED THAT SHE WAS NOT HIS WORLDLY HOPE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SUCH A POSITION WAS TOO GREAT
4344-8892-0033 SHE HAD MADE IT FOR HERSELF MAINLY BY HER APPEARANCE AND ATTRACTIVE BEHAVIOR TO HIM SINCE HER RETURN IF I HAD ONLY COME HOME IN A SHABBY DRESS AND TRIED TO SPEAK ROUGHLY THIS MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED SHE THOUGHT
4344-8892-0034 SHE DEPLORED LESS THE FACT THAN THE SAD POSSIBILITIES THAT MIGHT LIE HIDDEN THEREIN HER FATHER THEN INSISTED UPON HER LOOKING OVER HIS CHECKBOOK AND READING THE COUNTERFOILS THIS ALSO SHE OBEDIENTLY DID AND AT LAST CAME TO TWO OR THREE
4344-8892-0035 WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN TO DEFRAY SOME OF THE LATE EXPENSES OF HER CLOTHES BOARD AND EDUCATION I TOO COST A GOOD DEAL LIKE THE HORSES AND WAGONS AND CORN
4344-8892-0036 YOU'LL YIELD A BETTER RETURN DON'T THINK OF ME LIKE THAT SHE BEGGED A MERE CHATTEL
4344-8892-0037 EVEN IF IT TELLS AGAINST ME HE SAID GOOD HUMOREDLY AND HE LOOKED HER PROUDLY UP AND DOWN
4344-8892-0038 AND IN GIVING THE INFORMATION SHE ADDED INCIDENTALLY SO WE SHALL SOON LOSE THE MISTRESS OF HINTOCK HOUSE FOR SOME TIME I HEAR
4344-8892-0039 YES SHE'S GOING OFF TO FOREIGN PARTS TO MORROW FOR THE REST OF THE WINTER MONTHS
4344-8892-0040 WHEN THE OLD WOMAN HAD LEFT THE ROOM MELBURY TURNED TO HIS DAUGHTER AND SAID SO GRACE YOU'VE LOST YOUR NEW FRIEND
4344-8892-0041 GRACE SAID NOTHING NOW
4344-8892-0042 TIS WINTERBORNE'S AFFAIR HAS DONE THIS OH YES TIS SO LET ME SAY ONE WORD
4344-8892-0043 I NEVER DO MEET HIM FATHER

4344-8892-0045 BEAR THE ROUGHNESS OF A LIFE WITH HIM SHE SIGHED
4344-8892-0046 AT THAT SAME HOUR AND ALMOST AT THAT SAME MINUTE THERE WAS A CONVERSATION ABOUT WINTERBORNE IN PROGRESS IN THE VILLAGE STREET
4344-8892-0047 IT IS UPON JOHN SOUTH'S LIFE THAT ALL MISTER WINTERBORNE'S HOUSES HANG
4344-8892-0048 THEREUPON THE LAW IS THAT THE HOUSES FALL WITHOUT THE LEAST CHANCE OF ABSOLUTION INTO HER HANDS AT THE HOUSE
