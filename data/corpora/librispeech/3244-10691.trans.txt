3244-10691-0000 SAOUY WAS QUITE A DIFFERENT CHARACTER AND REPELLED EVERYONE WITH WHOM HE CAME IN CONTACT HE WAS ALWAYS GLOOMY AND IN SPITE OF HIS GREAT RICHES
3244-10691-0001 OF WHOM HE NEVER CEASED TO SPEAK EVIL TO THE KING ONE DAY WHILE THE KING AMUSED HIMSELF TALKING WITH HIS TWO VIZIRS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL THE CONVERSATION TURNED ON FEMALE SLAVES
3244-10691-0002 WHILE SOME DECLARED
3244-10691-0003 MAINTAINED THAT BEAUTY ALONE WAS NOT ENOUGH BUT THAT IT MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY WIT WISDOM MODESTY AND IF POSSIBLE KNOWLEDGE THE KING NOT ONLY DECLARED HIMSELF TO BE OF THIS OPINION
3244-10691-0004 YOU SEEM TO FIND THAT A VERY GREAT SUM FOR YOU IT MAY BE SO BUT NOT FOR ME
3244-10691-0005 AND CHARGED THEM DIRECTLY THEY HAD FOUND SUCH A ONE AS HE DESCRIBED TO INFORM HIM THEY PROMISED TO DO THEIR UTMOST AND NO DAY PASSED THAT THEY DID NOT BRING A SLAVE FOR HIS INSPECTION BUT NONE WAS FOUND WITHOUT SOME DEFECT
3244-10691-0006 AT LENGTH EARLY ONE MORNING WHILE KHACAN WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE KING'S PALACE A DEALER THROWING HIMSELF IN HIS WAY ANNOUNCED EAGERLY THAT A PERSIAN MERCHANT
3244-10691-0007 HAD A SLAVE TO SELL WHOSE WIT AND WISDOM WERE EQUAL TO HER INCOMPARABLE BEAUTY
3244-10691-0008 OVERJOYED AT THIS NEWS GAVE ORDERS THAT THE SLAVE SHOULD BE BROUGHT FOR HIS INSPECTION ON HIS RETURN FROM THE PALACE THE DEALER APPEARING AT THE APPOINTED HOUR KHACAN FOUND THE SLAVE BEAUTIFUL BEYOND HIS EXPECTATIONS
3244-10691-0009 AND IMMEDIATELY GAVE HER THE NAME OF THE FAIR PERSIAN BEING A MAN OF GREAT WISDOM AND LEARNING
3244-10691-0010 THAT HE WOULD SEEK IN VAIN ANOTHER SLAVE TO SURPASS HER IN ANY OF THE QUALITIES REQUIRED BY THE KING AND THEREFORE ASKED THE DEALER WHAT PRICE THE MERCHANT PUT UPON HER SIR WAS THE ANSWER
3244-10691-0011 FOR LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND GOLD PIECES HE WILL NOT LET HER GO HE DECLARES THAT WHAT WITH MASTERS FOR HER INSTRUCTION AND FOR BODILY EXERCISES NOT TO SPEAK OF CLOTHING AND NOURISHMENT HE HAS ALREADY SPENT THAT SUM UPON HER
3244-10691-0012 KHACAN WHO WAS BETTER ABLE TO JUDGE OF HER MERITS THAN THE DEALER WISHING TO BRING THE MATTER TO A CONCLUSION SENT FOR THE MERCHANT AND SAID TO HIM IT IS NOT FOR MYSELF THAT I WISH TO BUY YOUR SLAVE
3244-10691-0013 BUT FOR THE KING HER PRICE HOWEVER IS TOO HIGH SIR REPLIED THE MERCHANT I SHOULD ESTEEM IT AN HONOUR TO PRESENT HER TO HIS MAJESTY DID IT BECOME A MERCHANT TO DO SUCH A THING
3244-10691-0014 IT HAS COST ME TO MAKE HER SUCH AS SHE IS
3244-10691-0015 AND GIVEN TO THE MERCHANT WHO BEFORE WITHDRAWING SAID SIR AS SHE IS DESTINED FOR THE KING I WOULD HAVE YOU OBSERVE THAT SHE IS EXTREMELY TIRED WITH THE LONG JOURNEY
3244-10691-0016 AND BEFORE PRESENTING HER TO HIS MAJESTY YOU WOULD DO WELL TO KEEP HER A FORTNIGHT IN YOUR OWN HOUSE AND TO SEE THAT A LITTLE CARE IS BESTOWED UPON HER THE SUN HAS TANNED HER COMPLEXION BUT WHEN SHE HAS BEEN TWO OR THREE TIMES TO THE BATH
3244-10691-0017 AND IS FITTINGLY DRESSED YOU WILL SEE HOW MUCH HER BEAUTY WILL BE INCREASED
3244-10691-0018 HE GAVE THE BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN AN APARTMENT NEAR TO THAT OF HIS WIFE WHOM HE CHARGED TO TREAT HER AS BEFITTING A LADY DESTINED FOR THE KING AND TO ORDER FOR HER THE MOST
3244-10691-0019 BEFORE BIDDING ADIEU TO THE FAIR PERSIAN HE SAID TO HER NO HAPPINESS CAN BE GREATER THAN WHAT I HAVE PROCURED FOR YOU JUDGE FOR YOURSELF YOU NOW BELONG TO THE KING
3244-10691-0020 I HAVE HOWEVER TO WARN YOU OF ONE THING I HAVE A SON WHO THOUGH NOT WANTING IN SENSE IS YOUNG FOOLISH AND HEADSTRONG
3244-10691-0021 THE PERSIAN THANKED HIM FOR HIS ADVICE AND PROMISED TO PROFIT BY IT NOUREDDIN FOR SO THE VIZIR'S SON WAS NAMED WENT FREELY IN AND OUT OF HIS MOTHER'S APARTMENTS HE WAS YOUNG WELL MADE AND AGREEABLE
3244-10691-0022 AND HAD THE GIFT OF CHARMING ALL WITH WHOM HE CAME IN CONTACT AS SOON AS HE SAW THE BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN THOUGH AWARE THAT SHE WAS DESTINED FOR THE KING HE LET HIMSELF BE CARRIED AWAY BY HER CHARMS
3244-10691-0023 AND DETERMINED AT ONCE TO USE EVERY MEANS IN HIS POWER TO RETAIN HER FOR HIMSELF THE PERSIAN WAS EQUALLY CAPTIVATED BY NOUREDDIN AND SAID TO HERSELF THE VIZIR DOES ME TOO GREAT HONOUR IN BUYING ME FOR THE KING
3244-10691-0024 TO GAZE UPON HER BEAUTY TO TALK AND LAUGH WITH HER AND NEVER WOULD HAVE LEFT HER SIDE IF HIS MOTHER HAD NOT FORCED HIM SOME TIME HAVING ELAPSED ON ACCOUNT OF THE LONG JOURNEY
3244-10691-0025 SINCE THE BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN HAD BEEN TO THE BATH FIVE OR SIX DAYS AFTER HER PURCHASE THE VIZIR'S WIFE GAVE ORDERS THAT THE BATH SHOULD BE HEATED FOR HER
3244-10691-0026 AND THAT HER OWN FEMALE SLAVES SHOULD ATTEND HER THERE AND AFTER WARDS SHOULD ARRAY HER IN A MAGNIFICENT DRESS THAT HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR HER
3244-10691-0027 KISSING HER HAND THE BEAUTIFUL SLAVE SAID MADAM I DO NOT KNOW HOW YOU FIND ME IN THIS DRESS THAT YOU HAVE HAD PREPARED FOR ME YOUR WOMEN ASSURE ME THAT IT SUITS ME SO WELL THAT THEY HARDLY KNEW ME
3244-10691-0028 IF IT IS THE TRUTH THEY TELL ME AND NOT FLATTERY IT IS TO YOU I OWE THE TRANSFORMATION MY DAUGHTER
3244-10691-0029 THEY DO NOT FLATTER YOU I MYSELF HARDLY RECOGNISED YOU THE IMPROVEMENT IS NOT DUE TO THE DRESS ALONE BUT LARGELY TO THE BEAUTIFYING EFFECTS OF THE BATH I AM SO STRUCK BY ITS RESULTS THAT I WOULD TRY IT ON MYSELF
3244-10691-0030 SHE HAD NO SOONER GONE THAN HE ARRIVED AND NOT FINDING HIS MOTHER IN HER APARTMENT WOULD HAVE SOUGHT HER IN THAT OF THE PERSIAN THE TWO LITTLE SLAVES BARRED THE ENTRANCE
3244-10691-0031 SAYING THAT HIS MOTHER HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE ADMITTED TAKING EACH BY AN ARM HE PUT THEM OUT OF THE ANTEROOM AND SHUT THE DOOR THEN THEY RUSHED TO THE BATH INFORMING THEIR MISTRESS WITH SHRIEKS AND TEARS
3244-10691-0032 THAT NOUREDDIN HAD ALREADY GONE OUT MUCH ASTONISHED TO SEE THE VIZIR'S WIFE ENTER IN TEARS THE PERSIAN ASKED WHAT MISFORTUNE HAD HAPPENED WHAT EXCLAIMED THE LADY YOU ASK ME THAT KNOWING THAT MY SON NOUREDDIN HAS BEEN ALONE WITH YOU
3244-10691-0033 BUT MADAM INQUIRED THE PERSIAN WHAT HARM IS THERE IN THAT HOW
3244-10691-0034 CERTAINLY BUT NOUREDDIN HAS JUST BEEN TO TELL ME THAT HIS FATHER HAS CHANGED HIS MIND AND HAS BESTOWED ME UPON HIM I BELIEVED HIM AND SO GREAT IS MY AFFECTION FOR NOUREDDIN THAT I WOULD WILLINGLY PASS MY LIFE WITH HIM
3244-10691-0035 WOULD TO HEAVEN EXCLAIMED THE WIFE OF THE VIZIR THAT WHAT YOU SAY WERE TRUE BUT NOUREDDIN HAS DECEIVED YOU AND HIS FATHER WILL SACRIFICE HIM IN VENGEANCE FOR THE WRONG HE HAS DONE
3244-10691-0036 SO SAYING SHE WEPT BITTERLY AND ALL HER SLAVES WEPT WITH HER KHACAN ENTERING SHORTLY AFTER THIS WAS MUCH ASTONISHED TO FIND HIS WIFE AND HER SLAVES IN TEARS
3244-10691-0037 HIS WIFE TRIED TO CONSOLE HIM SAYING DO NOT TORMENT THYSELF WITH THE SALE OF MY JEWELS I WILL OBTAIN TEN THOUSAND GOLD PIECES AND WITH THIS SUM
3244-10691-0038 DO NOT SUPPOSE REPLIED HER HUSBAND THAT IT IS THE LOSS OF THE MONEY THAT AFFECTS ME MY HONOUR IS AT STAKE AND THAT IS MORE PRECIOUS TO ME THAN ALL MY WEALTH YOU KNOW THAT SAOUY IS MY MORTAL ENEMY
