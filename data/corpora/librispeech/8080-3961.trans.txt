8080-3961-0000 THE EX EMPEROR NOW LIVED IN A PRIVATE PALACE WITH THIS PRINCESS IN A LESS ROYAL STYLE AND THE NIOGO OF KOKIDEN TO WHOM WAS GIVEN THE HONORARY TITLE OF EX EMPRESS RESIDED IN THE IMPERIAL PALACE WITH THE EMPEROR
8080-3961-0001 HER SON AND TOOK UP A CONSPICUOUS POSITION THE EX EMPEROR STILL FELT SOME ANXIETY ABOUT THE HEIR APPARENT AND APPOINTED GENJI AS HIS GUARDIAN AS HE HAD NOT YET A SUITABLE PERSON FOR THAT OFFICE
8080-3961-0002 FOR THE LATTER THE SECOND SISTER OF THE EMPEROR WAS CHOSEN AND FOR THE FORMER THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE LADY OF ROKJIO WHOSE HUSBAND HAD BEEN A ROYAL PRINCE
8080-3961-0003 THE NUMBER OF PERSONS WHO TAKE A SHARE IN THE PROCESSION ON THIS OCCASION IS DEFINED BY REGULATIONS YET THE SELECTION OF THIS NUMBER WAS MOST CAREFULLY MADE FROM THE MOST FASHIONABLE OF THE NOBLES OF THE TIME
8080-3961-0004 AND THEIR DRESSES AND SADDLES WERE ALL CHOSEN OF BEAUTIFUL APPEARANCE GENJI WAS ALSO DIRECTED BY SPECIAL ORDER TO TAKE PART IN THE CEREMONY AS THE OCCASION WAS EXPECTED TO BE MAGNIFICENT
8080-3961-0005 EVERY CLASS OF THE PEOPLE SHOWED GREAT EAGERNESS TO WITNESS THE SCENE AND A GREAT NUMBER OF STANDS WERE ERECTED ALL ALONG THE ROAD THE DAY THUS LOOKED FORWARD TO AT LAST ARRIVED
8080-3961-0006 LADY AOI SELDOM SHOWED HERSELF ON SUCH OCCASIONS BESIDES SHE WAS NOW IN A DELICATE STATE OF HEALTH NEAR HER CONFINEMENT AND HAD THEREFORE NO INCLINATION TO GO OUT
8080-3961-0007 HER ATTENDANTS HOWEVER SUGGESTED TO HER THAT SHE OUGHT TO GO IT IS A GREAT PITY THEY SAID NOT TO SEE IT PEOPLE COME FROM A LONG DISTANCE TO SEE IT HER MOTHER ALSO SAID YOU SEEM BETTER TO DAY
8080-3961-0008 I THINK YOU HAD BETTER GO TAKE THESE GIRLS WITH YOU BEING PRESSED IN THIS WAY SHE HASTILY MADE UP HER MIND AND WENT WITH A TRAIN OF CARRIAGES ALL THE ROAD WAS THRONGED BY MULTITUDES OF PEOPLE
8080-3961-0009 EVEN NUNS AND AGED WOMEN FROM THEIR RETREATS WERE TO BE SEEN AMONGST THEM NUMEROUS CARRIAGES WERE ALSO SQUEEZED CLOSELY TOGETHER SO THAT THE BROAD THOROUGHFARE OF THE ICHIJIO ROAD WAS MADE ALMOST SPACELESS
8080-3961-0010 AND THEY AT LAST MADE THEIR WAY AND TOOK UP THEIR POSITION PUSHING THE OTHER TWO BACK WHERE NOTHING COULD BE SEEN EVEN BREAKING THEIR POLES THE LADY SO MALTREATED WAS OF COURSE EXTREMELY INDIGNANT
8080-3961-0011 AND SHE WOULD FAIN HAVE GONE HOME WITHOUT SEEING THE SPECTACLE BUT THERE WAS NO PASSAGE FOR RETIRING MEANWHILE THE APPROACH OF THE PROCESSION WAS ANNOUNCED AND ONLY THIS CALMED HER A LITTLE GENJI WAS AS USUAL CONSPICUOUS IN THE PROCESSION
8080-3961-0012 THE QUARRELS ABOUT THE CARRIAGE NATURALLY CAME TO THE EARS OF GENJI HE THOUGHT THAT LADY AOI WAS TOO MODEST TO BE THE INSTIGATOR OF SUCH A DISPUTE BUT HER HOUSE WAS ONE OF GREAT AND POWERFUL FAMILIES FAMOUS
8080-3961-0013 FOR OVERWEENING PRIDE A TENDENCY SHARED BY ITS DOMESTICS AND THEY FOR OTHER MOTIVES ALSO OF RIVALRY WERE GLAD TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF MORTIFYING THE LADY OF ROKJIO
8080-3961-0014 WHILE GENJI PRIVATELY TOOK VIOLET WITH HIM IN A CLOSE CARRIAGE TO SEE THE FESTIVAL AND SAW THE HORSE RACES WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT THE MIND OF THE LADY OF ROKJIO WAS STILL WAVERING AND UNSETTLED
8080-3961-0015 AND THIS STATE OF MIND BECAME MORE AND MORE AUGMENTED AND SERIOUS AFTER THE DAY OF THE DISPUTE ABOUT THE CARRIAGES WHICH MADE HER FEEL A BITTER DISDAIN AND JEALOUSY TOWARDS THE LADY AOI STRANGE TO SAY
8080-3961-0016 THAT FROM ABOUT THE SAME TIME LADY AOI BECAME ILL AND BEGAN TO SUFFER FROM SPIRITUAL INFLUENCES ALL SORTS OF EXORCISMS WERE DULY PERFORMED AND SOME SPIRITS CAME FORTH AND GAVE THEIR NAMES
8080-3961-0017 BUT AMONG THEM WAS A SPIRIT APPARENTLY A
8080-3961-0018 WHO WAS INTIMATELY KNOWN TO GENJI AND WHO HAD MOST INFLUENCE OVER HIM BUT THE SPIRIT GAVE NO INFORMATION TO THIS EFFECT HENCE SOME EVEN SURMISED THAT THE WANDERING SPIRIT OF SOME AGED NURSE OR THE LIKE
8080-3961-0019 LONG SINCE DEAD STILL HAUNTED THE MANSION AND MIGHT HAVE SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE LADY'S DELICATE HEALTH AND TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER
8080-3961-0020 THE LADY WHEN SHE WAS INFORMED OF THE SUFFERINGS OF LADY AOI FELT SOMEWHAT FOR HER AND BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE A SORT OF COMPASSION THIS BECAME STRONGER
8080-3961-0021 WHEN SHE WAS TOLD THAT THE SUFFERINGS OF THE LADY AOI WERE OWING TO SOME LIVING SPIRIT SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE NEVER WISHED ANY EVIL TO HER BUT WHEN SHE REFLECTED
8080-3961-0022 THERE WERE SEVERAL TIMES WHEN SHE BEGAN TO THINK THAT A WOUNDED SPIRIT SUCH AS HER OWN MIGHT HAVE SOME INFLUENCE OF THE KIND SHE HAD SOMETIMES DREAMS AFTER WEARY THINKING BETWEEN SLUMBER AND WAKING
8080-3961-0023 IN WHICH SHE SEEMED TO FLY TO SOME BEAUTIFUL GIRL APPARENTLY LADY AOI AND TO ENGAGE IN BITTER CONTENTION AND STRUGGLE WITH HER SHE BECAME EVEN TERRIFIED AT THESE DREAMS BUT YET
8080-3961-0024 THEY TOOK PLACE VERY OFTEN EVEN IN ORDINARY MATTERS SHE THOUGHT IT IS TOO COMMON A PRACTICE TO SAY NOTHING OF THE GOOD DONE BY PEOPLE BUT TO EXAGGERATE THE BAD AND SO IN SUCH CASES
8080-3961-0025 IF IT SHOULD BE RUMORED THAT MINE WAS THAT LIVING SPIRIT WHICH TORMENTED LADY AOI HOW TRYING IT WOULD BE TO ME IT IS NO RARE OCCURRENCE THAT ONE'S DISEMBODIED SPIRIT AFTER DEATH SHOULD WANDER ABOUT
8080-3961-0026 BUT EVEN THAT IS NOT A VERY AGREEABLE IDEA HOW MUCH MORE THEN MUST IT BE DISAGREEABLE TO HAVE THE REPUTE THAT ONE'S LIVING SPIRIT WAS INFLICTING PAIN UPON ANOTHER THESE THOUGHTS STILL PREYED UPON HER MIND
8080-3961-0027 AND MADE HER LISTLESS AND DEPRESSED IN DUE COURSE THE CONFINEMENT OF LADY AOI APPROACHED AT THE SAME TIME THE JEALOUS SPIRIT STILL VEXED HER AND NOW MORE VIGOROUS EXORCISING WAS EMPLOYED
8080-3961-0028 THE LADY WAS LYING ON HER COUCH DRESSED IN A PURE WHITE GARMENT WITH HER LONG TRESSES UNFASTENED HE APPROACHED HER AND TAKING HER HAND SAID WHAT SAD AFFLICTION YOU CAUSE US
8080-3961-0029 SHE THEN LIFTED HER HEAVY EYELIDS AND GAZED ON GENJI FOR SOME MINUTES HE TRIED TO SOOTHE HER AND SAID PRAY DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF TOO MUCH ABOUT MATTERS EVERYTHING WILL COME RIGHT YOUR ILLNESS I THINK WILL SOON PASS AWAY
8080-3961-0030 BUT NOW HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT SUCH THINGS MIGHT REALLY HAPPEN AND HE FELT DISTURBED YOU SPEAK THUS SAID GENJI AS IF HE WAS ADDRESSING THE SPIRIT BUT YOU DO NOT TELL ME WHO YOU ARE DO THEREFORE
8080-3961-0031 THE LADY WAS SAFELY DELIVERED OF A CHILD NOW TO PERFORM DUE THANKSGIVING FOR THIS HAPPY DELIVERANCE
8080-3961-0032 THEY CAME IN ALL HASTE WIPING OFF THE PERSPIRATION FROM THEIR FACES AS THEY JOURNEYED AND FROM THE EMPEROR AND ROYAL PRINCES DOWN TO THE ORDINARY NOBLES
8080-3961-0033 FIRST FEEDING AND THE MORE SO AS THE CHILD WAS A BOY TO RETURN TO THE LADY OF ROKJIO WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE SAFE DELIVERY OF LADY AOI A SLIGHTLY JEALOUS FEELING ONCE MORE SEEMED TO VEX HER
8080-3961-0034 AND WHEN SHE BEGAN TO MOVE ABOUT SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW IT WAS
8080-3961-0035 BUT THE ODOR SOON RETURNED AND SHE WAS DISGUSTED WITH HERSELF SOME DAYS PASSED AND THE DAY OF AUTUMN APPOINTMENTS ARRIVED BY THIS TIME LADY AOI'S HEALTH SEEMED PROGRESSING FAVORABLY
8080-3961-0036 AND GENJI LEFT HER IN ORDER TO ATTEND THE COURT WHEN HE SAID GOOD BY TO HER THERE WAS A STRANGE AND UNUSUAL LOOK IN HER EYES SADAIJIN ALSO WENT TO COURT AS WELL AS HIS SONS
8080-3961-0037 WHO HAD SOME EXPECTATION OF PROMOTION AND THERE WERE FEW PEOPLE LEFT IN THE MANSION IT WAS IN THE EVENING OF THAT DAY THAT LADY AOI WAS SUDDENLY ATTACKED BY A SPASM AND BEFORE THE NEWS OF THIS COULD BE CARRIED TO THE COURT
8080-3961-0038 SHE DIED THESE SAD TIDINGS SOON REACHED THE COURT AND CREATED GREAT DISTRESS AND CONFUSION EVEN THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR APPOINTMENTS AND PROMOTION WERE DISTURBED
8080-3961-0039 AS IT HAPPENED LATE IN THE EVENING THERE WAS NO TIME TO SEND FOR THE HEAD OF THE MONASTERY OR ANY OTHER DISTINGUISHED PRIEST MESSENGERS OF INQUIRY CAME ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO THE MANSION
8080-3961-0040 SHE WAS LEFT UNTOUCHED DURING TWO OR THREE DAYS IN THE HOPE THAT SHE MIGHT REVIVE BUT NO CHANGE TOOK PLACE AND NOW ALL HOPE WAS ABANDONED IN DUE COURSE THE CORPSE WAS TAKEN TO THE CEMETERY OF TORIBENO
8080-3961-0041 NUMEROUS MOURNERS AND PRIESTS OF DIFFERENT CHURCHES CROWDED TO THE SPOT WHILE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE EX EMPEROR PRINCESS WISTARIA AND THE HEIR APPARENT ALSO WERE PRESENT
8080-3961-0042 THE CEREMONY OF BURIAL WAS PERFORMED WITH ALL SOLEMNITY AND PATHOS THUS THE MODEST AND VIRTUOUS LADY AOI PASSED AWAY FOREVER GENJI FORTHWITH CONFINED HIMSELF TO HIS APARTMENT
8080-3961-0043 CONSTANTLY BORE HIM COMPANY AND CONVERSED WITH HIM BOTH ON SERIOUS AND AMUSING SUBJECTS THEIR STRUGGLE IN THE APARTMENT OF GEN NAISHI
8080-3961-0044 WERE AMONG THE TOPICS OF THEIR CONSOLING CONVERSATION IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE OCCASIONS THAT A SOFT SHOWER OF RAIN WAS FALLING THE EVENING WAS RENDERED CHEERLESS
8080-3961-0045 WALKING SLOWLY IN HIS MOURNING ROBES OF A DULL COLOR GENJI WAS LEANING OUT OF A WINDOW HIS CHEEK RESTING ON HIS HAND AND LOOKING OUT UPON THE HALF FADING SHRUBBERIES WAS HUMMING
8080-3961-0046 HAS SHE BECOME RAIN OR CLOUD TIS NOW UNKNOWN
8080-3961-0047 THEY HAD AS USUAL SOME PATHETIC CONVERSATION AND THEN THE LATTER HUMMED AS IF TO HIMSELF
8080-3961-0048 FROM WHICH DESCENDS THE PASSING RAIN HER GENTLE SOUL MAY DWELL THOUGH WE MAY CEASE TO TRACE ITS FORM IN VAIN THIS WAS SOON RESPONDED TO BY GENJI
8080-3961-0049 THAT CLOUDY SHRINE WE VIEW ON HIGH WHERE MY LOST LOVE MAY DWELL UNSEEN LOOKS GLOOMY NOW TO THIS SAD EYE THAT LOOKS WITH TEARS ON WHAT HAS BEEN
8080-3961-0050 HE WROTE A LETTER TO THE PRINCESS MOMO ZONO PEACH GARDENS HE HAD KNOWN HER LONG HE ADMIRED HER TOO SHE HAD BEEN A SPECTATOR WITH HER FATHER
8080-3961-0051 AND WAS ONE OF THOSE TO WHOM THE APPEARANCE OF GENJI WAS MOST WELCOME IN HIS LETTER HE STATED THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE SYMPATHY WITH HIM IN HIS SORROW AND HE ALSO SENT WITH IT THE FOLLOWING
8080-3961-0052 MANY AN AUTUMN HAVE I PAST IN GLOOMY THOUGHT BUT NONE I WEEN HAS BEEN SO MOURNFUL AS THE LAST WHICH RIFE WITH GRIEF AND CHANGE HATH BEEN THERE WAS INDEED
8080-3961-0053 NOTHING SERIOUS BETWEEN GENJI AND THIS PRINCESS YET AS FAR AS CORRESPONDENCE WAS CONCERNED THEY NOW AND THEN EXCHANGED LETTERS SO SHE DID NOT OBJECT TO RECEIVING THIS COMMUNICATION SHE FELT FOR HIM MUCH
8080-3961-0054 AND THE MEMENTOES OF THE DEAD BOTH TRIFLING AND VALUABLE WERE DISTRIBUTED IN A DUE AND AGREEABLE MANNER AND GENJI AT LENGTH LEFT THE GRAND MANSION WITH THE INTENTION OF FIRST GOING TO THE EX EMPEROR
8080-3961-0055 AFTER HIS DEPARTURE SADAIJIN WENT INTO THE APARTMENT OCCUPIED TILL LATELY BY HIM THE ROOM WAS THE SAME AS BEFORE AND EVERYTHING WAS UNCHANGED BUT HIS ONLY DAUGHTER
8080-3961-0056 THE PRIDE OF HIS OLD DAYS WAS NO MORE AND HIS SON IN LAW HAD GONE TOO HE LOOKED AROUND HIM FOR SOME MOMENTS HE SAW SOME PAPERS LYING ABOUT
8080-3961-0057 THEY WERE THOSE ON WHICH GENJI HAD BEEN PRACTISING PENMANSHIP FOR AMUSEMENT SOME IN CHINESE OTHERS IN JAPANESE SOME IN FREE STYLE OTHERS IN STIFF AMONG THESE PAPERS
8080-3961-0058 HE SAW ONE ON WHICH THE WORDS OLD PILLOWS AND OLD QUILTS WERE WRITTEN AND CLOSE TO THESE THE FOLLOWING HOW MUCH THE SOUL DEPARTED STILL MAY LOVE TO LINGER ROUND THIS COUCH
8080-3961-0059 MY OWN HEART TELLS ME EVEN I RELUCTANT AM TO LEAVE IT NOW AND ON ANOTHER OF THESE PAPERS ACCOMPANYING THE WORDS THE WHITE FROST LIES UPON THE TILES THE FOLLOWING
8080-3961-0060 HOW MANY MORE OF NIGHTS SHALL I ON THIS LONE BED WITHOUT THEE LIE THE FLOWER HAS LEFT ITS WELL KNOWN BED AND O'ER ITS PLACE
8080-3961-0061 THE DEWS ARE SHED AS SADAIJIN WAS TURNING OVER THESE PAPERS A WITHERED FLOWER WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE MARKED SOME PARTICULAR OCCASION DROPPED FROM AMONGST THEM
8080-3961-0062 AND THEN PROCEEDED TO HIS MANSION AT NIJIO HE WENT TO THE WESTERN WING TO VISIT THE YOUNG VIOLET ALL WERE HABITED IN NEW WINTER APPAREL AND LOOKED FRESH AND BLOOMING
8080-3961-0063 HOW LONG IT SEEMS SINCE I SAW YOU HE EXCLAIMED VIOLET TURNED HER GLANCE A LITTLE ASIDE SHE WAS APPARENTLY SHY WHICH ONLY INCREASED HER BEAUTY HE APPROACHED
8080-3961-0064 FIRST OF ALL HE SENT A LETTER TO SADAIJIN'S MAKING INQUIRY AFTER HIS INFANT CHILD AT THIS TIME HE CONFINED HIMSELF MORE THAN USUAL TO HIS OWN HOUSE AND FOR COMPANIONSHIP HE WAS CONSTANTLY WITH VIOLET
8080-3961-0065 WHO WAS NOW APPROACHING WOMANHOOD HE WOULD SOMETIMES TALK WITH HER DIFFERENTLY FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH HE WOULD SPEAK TO A MERE GIRL BUT ON HER PART SHE SEEMED NOT TO NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE AND FOR THEIR DAILY AMUSEMENT EITHER GO
8080-3961-0066 AND SOMETIMES THEY WOULD PLAY ON TILL LATE IN THE EVENING SOME WEEKS THUS PASSED AWAY AND THERE WAS ONE MORNING WHEN VIOLET DID NOT APPEAR SO EARLY AS USUAL THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE WHO DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS THE REASON
8080-3961-0067 WERE ANXIOUS ABOUT HER THINKING SHE WAS INDISPOSED ABOUT NOON GENJI CAME HE ENTERED THE LITTLE ROOM SAYING ARE YOU NOT QUITE WELL PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO PLAY AT GO AGAIN LIKE LAST NIGHT FOR A CHANGE
8080-3961-0068 SHE STILL CONTINUED SILENT AND SHY THIS WAS THE EVENING OF WILD BOAR'S DAY AND SOME MOCHI POUNDED RICE CAKE WAS PRESENTED TO HIM ACCORDING TO CUSTOM ON A TRAY OF PLAIN WHITE WOOD
8080-3961-0069 TO DAY IS NOT A VERY OPPORTUNE DAY I WOULD RATHER HAVE THEM TO MORROW EVENING
8080-3961-0070 SO SAYING HE SMILED A LITTLE AND SHARP
8080-3961-0071 SOON UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE MEANT AND THIS HE ACCORDINGLY DID ON THE MORROW ON A BEAUTIFUL FLOWER WAITER UP TO THIS TIME NOTHING ABOUT VIOLET HAD BEEN PUBLICLY KNOWN
8080-3961-0072 AND GENJI THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO INFORM HER FATHER ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER BUT HE CONSIDERED HE HAD BETTER HAVE THE CEREMONY OF MOGI FIRST PERFORMED AND ORDERED PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE WITH THAT OBJECT
8080-3961-0073 LET US HERE NOTICE THAT THE YOUNG DAUGHTER OF UDAIJIN AFTER SHE SAW GENJI WAS LONGING TO SEE HIM AGAIN THIS INCLINATION WAS PERCEIVED BY HER RELATIONS IT SEEMS
8080-3961-0074 THAT HER FATHER WAS NOT QUITE AVERSE TO THIS LIKING AND HE TOLD HIS ELDEST DAUGHTER THE REIGNING EMPEROR'S MOTHER THAT GENJI WAS RECENTLY BEREAVED OF HIS GOOD CONSORT AND THAT HE SHOULD NOT FEEL DISCONTENTED
8080-3961-0075 IF HIS DAUGHTER WERE TO TAKE THE PLACE OF LADY AOI BUT THIS THE ROYAL MOTHER DID NOT APPROVE IT WOULD BE FAR BETTER FOR HER TO BE INTRODUCED AT COURT SHE SAID
