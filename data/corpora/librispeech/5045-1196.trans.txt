5045-1196-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN OJO IS FORGIVEN THE NEXT MORNING THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS WENT TO THE PRISON AND TOOK OJO AWAY TO THE ROYAL PALACE WHERE HE WAS SUMMONED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE GIRL RULER FOR JUDGMENT
5045-1196-0001 AGAIN THE SOLDIER PUT UPON THE BOY THE JEWELED HANDCUFFS AND WHITE PRISONER'S ROBE WITH THE PEAKED TOP AND HOLES FOR THE EYES OJO WAS SO ASHAMED BOTH OF HIS DISGRACE AND THE FAULT HE HAD COMMITTED THAT HE WAS GLAD TO BE COVERED UP IN THIS WAY
5045-1196-0002 SO THAT PEOPLE COULD NOT SEE HIM OR KNOW WHO HE WAS HE FOLLOWED THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS VERY WILLINGLY ANXIOUS THAT HIS FATE MIGHT BE DECIDED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE INHABITANTS OF THE EMERALD CITY WERE POLITE PEOPLE
5045-1196-0003 AND NEVER JEERED AT THE UNFORTUNATE BUT IT WAS SO LONG SINCE THEY HAD SEEN A PRISONER THAT THEY CAST MANY CURIOUS LOOKS TOWARD THE BOY AND MANY OF THEM HURRIED AWAY TO THE ROYAL PALACE TO BE PRESENT DURING THE TRIAL WHEN OJO WAS ESCORTED INTO THE GREAT THRONE ROOM OF THE PALACE
5045-1196-0004 HE FOUND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ASSEMBLED THERE IN THE MAGNIFICENT EMERALD THRONE WHICH SPARKLED WITH COUNTLESS JEWELS SAT OZMA OF OZ IN HER ROBE OF STATE WHICH WAS EMBROIDERED WITH EMERALDS AND PEARLS
5045-1196-0005 AND ON HER LEFT THE SCARECROW STILL LOWER BUT NEARLY IN FRONT OF OZMA SAT THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ AND ON A SMALL TABLE BESIDE HIM WAS THE GOLDEN VASE FROM DOROTHY'S ROOM INTO WHICH SCRAPS HAD DROPPED THE STOLEN CLOVER
5045-1196-0006 AT OZMA'S FEET CROUCHED TWO ENORMOUS BEASTS EACH THE LARGEST AND MOST POWERFUL OF ITS KIND ALTHOUGH THESE BEASTS WERE QUITE FREE NO ONE PRESENT WAS ALARMED BY THEM FOR THE COWARDLY LION AND THE HUNGRY TIGER WERE WELL KNOWN AND RESPECTED IN THE EMERALD CITY
5045-1196-0007 AND THEY ALWAYS GUARDED THE RULER WHEN SHE HELD HIGH COURT IN THE THRONE ROOM THERE WAS STILL ANOTHER BEAST PRESENT BUT THIS ONE DOROTHY HELD IN HER ARMS FOR IT WAS HER CONSTANT COMPANION THE LITTLE DOG TOTO
5045-1196-0008 SEATED ON IVORY CHAIRS BEFORE OZMA WITH A CLEAR SPACE BETWEEN THEM AND THE THRONE WERE MANY OF THE NOBILITY OF THE EMERALD CITY LORDS AND LADIES IN BEAUTIFUL COSTUMES AND OFFICIALS OF THE KINGDOM IN THE ROYAL UNIFORMS OF OZ
5045-1196-0009 BEHIND THESE COURTIERS WERE OTHERS OF LESS IMPORTANCE FILLING THE GREAT HALL TO THE VERY DOORS AT THE SAME MOMENT THAT THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS ARRIVED WITH OJO THE SHAGGY MAN ENTERED FROM A SIDE DOOR ESCORTING THE PATCHWORK GIRL THE WOOZY AND THE GLASS CAT
5045-1196-0010 NOTHING COULD AWE THE PATCHWORK GIRL AND ALTHOUGH THE WOOZY WAS SOMEWHAT UNEASY IN THESE SPLENDID SURROUNDINGS THE GLASS CAT WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE SUMPTUOUSNESS OF THE COURT AND THE IMPRESSIVENESS OF THE OCCASION PRETTY BIG WORDS BUT QUITE EXPRESSIVE
5045-1196-0011 OZMA SAT LOOKING AT THE PRISONER A LONG TIME THEN SHE SAID GENTLY ONE OF THE LAWS OF OZ FORBIDS ANYONE TO PICK A SIX LEAVED CLOVER YOU ARE ACCUSED OF HAVING BROKEN THIS LAW EVEN AFTER YOU HAD BEEN WARNED NOT TO DO SO
5045-1196-0012 OJO HUNG HIS HEAD AND WHILE HE HESITATED HOW TO REPLY THE PATCHWORK GIRL STEPPED FORWARD AND SPOKE FOR HIM ALL THIS FUSS IS ABOUT NOTHING AT ALL SHE SAID FACING OZMA UNABASHED
5045-1196-0013 SEARCH HIM IF YOU LIKE BUT YOU WON'T FIND THE CLOVER LOOK IN HIS BASKET AND YOU'LL FIND IT'S NOT THERE HE HASN'T GOT IT SO I DEMAND THAT YOU SET THIS POOR MUNCHKIN BOY FREE THE PEOPLE OF OZ LISTENED TO THIS DEFIANCE IN AMAZEMENT
5045-1196-0014 AND WONDERED AT THE QUEER PATCHWORK GIRL WHO DARED TALK SO BOLDLY TO THEIR RULER BUT OZMA SAT SILENT AND MOTIONLESS AND IT WAS THE LITTLE WIZARD WHO ANSWERED SCRAPS
5045-1196-0015 HE SAID I THINK IT HAS I THINK THE BOY HID IT IN HIS BASKET AND THEN GAVE THE BASKET TO YOU I ALSO THINK YOU DROPPED THE CLOVER INTO THIS VASE WHICH STOOD IN PRINCESS DOROTHY'S ROOM HOPING TO GET RID OF IT SO IT WOULD NOT PROVE THE BOY GUILTY
5045-1196-0016 YOU'RE A STRANGER HERE MISS PATCHES AND SO YOU DON'T KNOW THAT NOTHING CAN BE HIDDEN FROM OUR POWERFUL RULER'S MAGIC PICTURE NOR FROM THE WATCHFUL EYES OF THE HUMBLE WIZARD OF OZ LOOK ALL OF YOU
5045-1196-0017 WITH THESE WORDS HE WAVED HIS HANDS TOWARD THE VASE ON THE TABLE WHICH SCRAPS NOW NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM THE MOUTH OF THE VASE A PLANT SPROUTED SLOWLY GROWING BEFORE THEIR EYES UNTIL IT BECAME A BEAUTIFUL BUSH
5045-1196-0018 OZMA TURNED TO OJO DID YOU PICK THE SIX LEAVED CLOVER SHE ASKED YES HE REPLIED
5045-1196-0019 WHAT CAUSED YOU TO THINK THAT ASKED THE RULER WHY IT SEEMED TO ME A FOOLISH LAW UNJUST AND UNREASONABLE EVEN NOW I CAN SEE NO HARM IN PICKING A SIX LEAVED CLOVER AND I I HAD NOT SEEN THE EMERALD CITY THEN
5045-1196-0020 OZMA REGARDED HIM MUSINGLY HER CHIN RESTING UPON HER HAND BUT SHE WAS NOT ANGRY ON THE CONTRARY
5045-1196-0021 I SUPPOSE A GOOD MANY LAWS SEEM FOOLISH TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEM SHE SAID BUT NO LAW IS EVER MADE WITHOUT SOME PURPOSE AND THAT PURPOSE IS USUALLY TO PROTECT ALL THE PEOPLE AND GUARD THEIR WELFARE
5045-1196-0022 WAS A SIX LEAVED CLOVER THESE WITCHES AND MAGICIANS CAUSED SO MUCH TROUBLE AMONG MY PEOPLE OFTEN USING THEIR POWERS FOR EVIL RATHER THAN GOOD THAT I DECIDED TO FORBID ANYONE TO PRACTICE MAGIC OR SORCERY EXCEPT GLINDA THE GOOD
5045-1196-0023 AND HER ASSISTANT THE WIZARD OF OZ BOTH OF WHOM I CAN TRUST TO USE THEIR ARTS ONLY TO BENEFIT MY PEOPLE AND TO MAKE THEM HAPPIER SINCE I ISSUED THAT LAW THE LAND OF OZ HAS BEEN FAR MORE PEACEFUL AND QUIET
5045-1196-0024 BUT I LEARNED THAT SOME OF THE WITCHES AND MAGICIANS WERE STILL PRACTICING MAGIC ON THE SLY AND USING THE SIX LEAVED CLOVERS TO MAKE THEIR POTIONS AND CHARMS THEREFORE I MADE ANOTHER LAW FORBIDDING ANYONE FROM PLUCKING A SIX LEAVED CLOVER
5045-1196-0025 THAT HAS ALMOST PUT AN END TO WICKED SORCERY IN OUR LAND SO YOU SEE THE LAW WAS NOT A FOOLISH ONE BUT WISE AND JUST AND IN ANY EVENT IT IS WRONG TO DISOBEY A LAW
5045-1196-0026 OJO KNEW SHE WAS RIGHT AND FELT GREATLY MORTIFIED TO REALIZE HE HAD ACTED AND SPOKEN SO RIDICULOUSLY BUT HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED OZMA IN THE FACE SAYING I AM SORRY I HAVE ACTED WRONGLY AND BROKEN YOUR LAW
5045-1196-0027 YOU ARE FORGIVEN SHE SAID FOR ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE COMMITTED A SERIOUS FAULT YOU ARE NOW PENITENT AND I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN PUNISHED ENOUGH SOLDIER RELEASE OJO THE LUCKY AND I BEG YOUR PARDON I'M OJO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE BOY
5045-1196-0028 AS THE ROYAL AUDIENCE WAS NOW OVER THEY BEGAN TO LEAVE THE THRONE ROOM AND SOON THERE WERE NONE REMAINING EXCEPT OJO AND HIS FRIENDS AND OZMA AND HER FAVORITES THE GIRL RULER NOW ASKED OJO TO SIT DOWN AND TELL HER ALL HIS STORY WHICH HE DID
5045-1196-0029 THEN SHE SAID THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WAS WRONG TO MAKE THE GLASS CAT AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL FOR IT WAS AGAINST THE LAW AND IF HE HAD NOT UNLAWFULLY KEPT THE BOTTLE OF LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION STANDING ON HIS SHELF
5045-1196-0030 AND TO UNC NUNKIE COULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED I CAN UNDERSTAND HOWEVER THAT OJO WHO LOVES HIS UNCLE WILL BE UNHAPPY UNLESS HE CAN SAVE HIM ALSO I FEEL IT IS WRONG TO LEAVE THOSE TWO VICTIMS STANDING AS MARBLE STATUES WHEN THEY OUGHT TO BE ALIVE
5045-1196-0031 SO I PROPOSE WE ALLOW DOCTOR PIPT TO MAKE THE MAGIC CHARM WHICH WILL SAVE THEM
5045-1196-0032 THAT IS PERHAPS THE BEST THING TO DO REPLIED THE WIZARD BUT AFTER THE CROOKED MAGICIAN HAS RESTORED THOSE POOR PEOPLE TO LIFE YOU MUST TAKE AWAY HIS MAGIC POWERS I WILL PROMISED OZMA NOW TELL ME PLEASE WHAT MAGIC THINGS MUST YOU FIND
5045-1196-0033 THE THREE HAIRS FROM THE WOOZY'S TAIL I HAVE SAID THE BOY THAT IS I HAVE THE WOOZY AND THE HAIRS ARE IN HIS TAIL THE SIX LEAVED CLOVER I I YOU MAY TAKE IT AND KEEP IT SAID OZMA
5045-1196-0034 THAT WILL NOT BE BREAKING THE LAW FOR IT IS ALREADY PICKED AND THE CRIME OF PICKING IT IS FORGIVEN THANK YOU CRIED OJO GRATEFULLY THEN HE CONTINUED THE NEXT THING I MUST FIND IS A GILL OF WATER FROM A DARK WELL THE WIZARD SHOOK HIS HEAD
5045-1196-0035 IF DOROTHY GOES THEN I MUST GO TO TAKE CARE OF HER SAID THE SCARECROW DECIDEDLY A DARK WELL CAN ONLY BE DISCOVERED IN SOME OUT OF THE WAY PLACE AND THERE MAY BE DANGERS THERE YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION TO ACCOMPANY DOROTHY SAID OZMA
5045-1196-0036 AND WHILE YOU ARE GONE I WILL TAKE CARE OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL I'LL TAKE CARE OF MYSELF ANNOUNCED SCRAPS FOR I'M GOING WITH THE SCARECROW AND DOROTHY I PROMISED OJO TO HELP HIM FIND THE THINGS HE WANTS AND I'LL STICK TO MY PROMISE VERY WELL REPLIED OZMA
5045-1196-0037 I PREFER TO REMAIN HERE SAID THE CAT I'VE NEARLY BEEN NICKED HALF A DOZEN TIMES ALREADY AND IF THEY'RE GOING INTO DANGERS IT'S BEST FOR ME TO KEEP AWAY FROM THEM LET JELLIA JAMB KEEP HER TILL OJO RETURNS SUGGESTED DOROTHY
5045-1196-0038 SO THEY NOW SEPARATED TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY OZMA GAVE THE MUNCHKIN BOY A ROOM IN THE PALACE FOR THAT NIGHT
5045-1196-0039 GETTING ACQUAINTED AS SHE SAID AND RECEIVING ADVICE FROM THE SHAGGY MAN AS TO WHERE THEY MUST GO THE SHAGGY MAN HAD WANDERED IN MANY PARTS OF OZ AND SO HAD DOROTHY FOR THAT MATTER YET NEITHER OF THEM KNEW WHERE A DARK WELL WAS TO BE FOUND
5045-1196-0040 IF SUCH A THING IS ANYWHERE IN THE SETTLED PARTS OF OZ SAID DOROTHY WE'D PROB'LY HAVE HEARD OF IT LONG AGO IF IT'S IN THE WILD PARTS OF THE COUNTRY NO ONE THERE WOULD NEED A DARK WELL P'RAPS THERE ISN'T SUCH A THING OH THERE MUST BE
5045-1196-0041 AS FOR FINDING IT WE MUST TRUST TO LUCK DON'T DO THAT BEGGED OJO EARNESTLY
