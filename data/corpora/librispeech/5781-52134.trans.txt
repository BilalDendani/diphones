5781-52134-0000 OF THE GIRLS VIOLET PRISCILLA AND LYDIA THOSE OF THE SECOND WIFE AS FOLLOWS FOOTY EMBRUS CALEB MITCHELL CUFFEE AND JACOB WHO IS THE AUTHOR AND THE GIRLS
5781-52134-0001 CATHERINE AND RETTA AS I HAVE SAID OLD COLONEL DICK SINGLETON HAD TWO SONS AND TWO DAUGHTERS AND EACH HAD A PLANTATION THEIR NAMES WERE JOHN MATT MARIANNA AND ANGELICO THEY WERE VERY AGREEABLE TOGETHER
5781-52134-0002 COLONEL M R SINGLETON SENT MY TWO SISTERS VIOLET AND PRISCILLA TO HIS BROTHER JOHN AND WHILE THEY WERE THERE THEY MARRIED TWO OF THE MEN ON HIS PLACE BY MUTUAL CONSENT MASTER ALLOWED THEM TO REMAIN ON HIS BROTHER'S PLACE BUT SOME TIME AFTER THIS
5781-52134-0003 JOHN SINGLETON HAD SOME OF HIS PROPERTY DESTROYED BY WATER
5781-52134-0004 WHAT IS KNOWN IN THE NORTH AS HIGH TIDES ONE OF THESE FRESHETS SWEPT AWAY JOHN SINGLETON'S SLAVE HOUSES HIS BARNS WITH HORSES MULES AND COWS THESE CAUSED HIS DEATH BY A BROKEN HEART
5781-52134-0005 AND SINCE HE OWED A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY HIS SLAVES HAD TO BE SOLD A MISTER MANNING BOUGHT A PORTION OF THEM AND CHARLES LOGIN THE REST THESE TWO MEN WERE KNOWN AS THE GREATEST SLAVE TRADERS IN THE SOUTH MY SISTERS WERE AMONG THE NUMBER THAT MISTER MANNING BOUGHT
5781-52134-0006 HE WAS TO TAKE THEM INTO THE STATE OF LOUISIANA FOR SALE BUT SOME OF THE MEN DID NOT WANT TO GO WITH HIM AND HE PUT THOSE IN PRISON UNTIL HE WAS READY TO START MY SISTERS HUSBANDS WERE AMONG THE PRISONERS IN THE SUMTERVILLE JAIL
5781-52134-0007 CAME TO MASTER'S PLACE TO VISIT US WHEN THE DAY CAME FOR THEM TO LEAVE SOME WHO SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN WILLING TO GO AT FIRST REFUSED AND WERE HANDCUFFED TOGETHER AND GUARDED ON THEIR WAY TO THE CARS BY WHITE MEN
5781-52134-0008 THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE DRIVEN TO THE DEPOT IN CROWDS LIKE SO MANY CATTLE AND THE SIGHT OF THEM CAUSED GREAT EXCITEMENT AMONG MASTER'S NEGROES IMAGINE A MASS OF UNEDUCATED PEOPLE SHEDDING TEARS AND YELLING AT THE TOP OF THEIR VOICES IN ANGUISH
5781-52134-0009 WHICH WAS ABOUT FOUR MILES FROM MASTER'S PLACE THE EXCITEMENT WAS SO GREAT THAT THE OVERSEER AND DRIVER COULD NOT CONTROL THE RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OF THOSE THAT WERE GOING AWAY AS A LARGE CROWD OF BOTH OLD AND YOUNG WENT DOWN TO THE DEPOT TO SEE THEM OFF
5781-52134-0010 LOUISIANA WAS CONSIDERED BY THE SLAVES A PLACE OF SLAUGHTER
5781-52134-0011 WHILE PASSING ALONG MANY OF THE NEGROES LEFT THEIR MASTERS FIELDS AND JOINED US AS WE MARCHED TO THE CARS SOME WERE YELLING AND WRINGING THEIR HANDS WHILE OTHERS WERE SINGING LITTLE HYMNS THAT THEY HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO FOR THE CONSOLATION OF THOSE THAT WERE GOING AWAY
5781-52134-0012 SUCH AS WHEN WE ALL MEET IN HEAVEN THERE IS NO PARTING THERE WHEN WE ALL MEET IN HEAVEN THERE IS PARTING NO MORE WE ARRIVED AT THE DEPOT AND HAD TO WAIT FOR THE CARS TO BRING THE OTHERS FROM THE SUMTERVILLE JAIL
5781-52134-0013 BUT THEY SOON CAME IN SIGHT AND WHEN THE NOISE OF THE CARS HAD DIED AWAY WE HEARD WAILING AND SHRIEKS FROM THOSE IN THE CARS WHILE SOME WERE WEEPING OTHERS WERE FIDDLING PICKING BANJO AND DANCING AS THEY USED TO DO IN THEIR CABINS ON THE PLANTATIONS
5781-52134-0014 THOSE WHO WERE SO MERRY HAD VERY BAD MASTERS AND EVEN THOUGH THEY STOOD A CHANCE OF BEING SOLD TO ONE AS BAD OR EVEN WORSE YET THEY WERE GLAD TO BE RID OF THE ONE THEY KNEW WHILE THE CARS WERE AT THE DEPOT A LARGE CROWD OF WHITE PEOPLE GATHERED
5781-52134-0015 LAUGHING AND TALKING ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF NEGRO TRAFFIC BUT WHEN THE CARS BEGAN TO START AND THE CONDUCTOR CRIED OUT ALL WHO ARE GOING ON THIS TRAIN MUST GET ON BOARD WITHOUT DELAY
5781-52134-0016 WE HEARD THE WEEPING AND WAILING FROM THE SLAVES AS FAR AS HUMAN VOICE COULD BE HEARD AND FROM THAT TIME TO THE PRESENT I HAVE NEITHER SEEN NOR HEARD FROM MY TWO SISTERS NOR ANY OF THOSE WHO LEFT CLARKSON DEPOT ON THAT MEMORABLE DAY
5781-52134-0017 SOMETIMES THEY GOT OLD BOARDS AND NAILED THEM UP STUFFING THE CRACKS WITH RAGS WHEN THEY COULD NOT GET BOARDS THEY HUNG UP OLD CLOTHES WHEN THE FAMILY INCREASED THE CHILDREN ALL SLEPT TOGETHER BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS UNTIL ONE GOT MARRIED
5781-52134-0018 THEN A PART OF ANOTHER CABIN WAS ASSIGNED TO THAT ONE BUT THE REST WOULD HAVE TO REMAIN WITH THEIR MOTHER AND FATHER AS IN CHILDHOOD UNLESS THEY COULD GET WITH SOME OF THEIR RELATIVES OR FRIENDS WHO HAD SMALL FAMILIES OR UNLESS THEY WERE SOLD
5781-52134-0019 BUT OF COURSE THE RULES OF MODESTY WERE HELD IN SOME DEGREES BY THE SLAVES WHILE IT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED THAT THEY COULD ENTERTAIN THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF IT ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR CONDITION A PORTION OF THE TIME THE YOUNG MEN SLEPT IN THE APARTMENT KNOWN AS THE KITCHEN
5781-52134-0020 AND THE YOUNG WOMEN SLEPT IN THE ROOM WITH THEIR MOTHER AND FATHER THE TWO FAMILIES HAD TO USE ONE FIREPLACE ONE WHO WAS ACCUSTOMED TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE SLAVES LIVED IN THEIR CABINS COULD TELL AS SOON AS THEY ENTERED WHETHER THEY WERE FRIENDLY OR NOT FOR WHEN THEY DID NOT AGREE
5781-52134-0021 THE FIRES OF THE TWO FAMILIES DID NOT MEET ON THE HEARTH BUT THERE WAS A VACANCY BETWEEN THEM THAT WAS A SIGN OF DISAGREEMENT IN A CASE OF THIS KIND WHEN EITHER OF THE FAMILIES STOLE A HOG COW OR SHEEP FROM THE MASTER
5781-52134-0022 SOMETIME AFTERWARD THIS MAN WHO HAD BEEN BETRAYED THOUGHT HE WOULD GET EVEN WITH HIS ENEMY SO ABOUT TWO MONTHS LATER HE KILLED ANOTHER HOG AND AFTER EATING A PART OF IT STOLE INTO THE APARTMENT OF THE OTHER FAMILY
5781-52134-0023 AND HID A PORTION OF THE MEAT AMONG THE OLD CLOTHES THEN HE TOLD THE OVERSEER THAT HE HAD SEEN THE MAN GO OUT LATE THAT NIGHT AND THAT HE HAD NOT COME HOME UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING
5781-52134-0024 HE HAD CALLED HIS WIFE TO THE WINDOW AND SHE HAD TAKEN SOMETHING IN HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS BUT IF THE OVERSEER WOULD GO THERE RIGHT AWAY HE WOULD FIND IT THE OVERSEER WENT AND SEARCHED AND FOUND THE MEAT SO THE MAN WAS WHIPPED
5781-52134-0025 WHEN IT WAS TOO WARM FOR THEM TO SLEEP COMFORTABLY THEY ALL SLEPT UNDER TREES UNTIL IT GREW TOO COOL THAT IS ALONG IN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER THEN THEY TOOK UP THEIR BEDS AND WALKED JOE AND THE TURKEY
5781-52134-0026 JOE WAS A BOY WHO WAS WAITER TO HIS MASTER ONE MISTER KING AND HE AND HIS WIFE WERE VERY FOND OF COMPANY MISSUS KING ALWAYS HAD CHICKENS AND TURKEY FOR DINNER BUT AT ONE TIME THE COMPANY WAS SO LARGE THAT THEY DID NOT LEAVE ANYTHING FOR THE SERVANTS
5781-52134-0027 HE PUT ONE OF HIS SHIRTS OVER THEM WHEN MISSUS KING CALLED JOE HE ANSWERED BUT DID NOT GO RIGHT AWAY AS HE GENERALLY DID AND WHEN HE DID GO HIS MISTRESS SAID JOE WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH YOU HE ANSWERED NOFFING MISSIS
5781-52134-0028 THEN HE WENT AND OPENED THE GATE FOR THE COMPANY SOON AFTER JOE WAS BACK IN THE KITCHEN AGAIN AND MISSUS KING WENT DOWN TO SEE WHAT HE WAS DOING SEEING THE POT ON SHE SAID JOE WHAT IS IN THAT POT HE SAID NOFFING MISSIS BUT MY SHIRT
5781-52134-0029 AM GWINE TO WASH IT SHE DID NOT BELIEVE HIM SO SHE TOOK A FORK AND STUCK IT IN THE POT TAKING OUT THE SHIRT AND SHE FOUND THE TURKEY SHE ASKED HIM HOW THE TURKEY HAD GOT INTO THE POT HE SAID HE DID NOT KNOW BUT RECKONED THE TURKEY GOT IN HIMSELF
5781-52134-0030 WHEN THE SLAVEHOLDERS HAD MADE A LARGE CROP THEY WERE PLEASED AND GAVE THE SLAVES FROM FIVE TO SIX DAYS WHICH WERE MUCH ENJOYED BY THE NEGROES ESPECIALLY BY THOSE WHO COULD DANCE CHRISTMAS MORNING WAS HELD SACRED BOTH BY MASTER AND SLAVES BUT IN THE AFTERNOON
5781-52134-0031 OR IN A PART OF THE NEXT DAY THE SLAVES WERE REQUIRED TO DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO THE PLEASURE OF THEIR MASTERS SOME OF THE MASTERS WOULD BUY PRESENTS FOR THE SLAVES SUCH AS HATS AND TOBACCO FOR THE MEN HANDKERCHIEFS AND LITTLE THINGS FOR THE WOMEN
5781-52134-0032 THESE THINGS WERE GIVEN AFTER THEY HAD BEEN PLEASED WITH THEM AFTER EITHER DANCING OR SOMETHING FOR THEIR AMUSEMENT WHEN THE SLAVES CAME UP TO THEIR MASTERS AND MISTRESSES THE LATTER WOULD WELCOME THEM THE MEN WOULD TAKE OFF THEIR HATS AND BOW AND THE WOMEN WOULD MAKE A LOW COURTESY
5781-52134-0033 AND SOME WHO WERE BORN IN AFRICA WOULD SING SOME OF THEIR SONGS OR TELL DIFFERENT STORIES OF THE CUSTOMS IN AFRICA AFTER THIS THEY WOULD SPEND HALF A DAY IN DANCING IN SOME LARGE COTTON HOUSE OR ON A SCAFFOLD THE MASTER PROVIDING FIDDLERS WHO CAME FROM OTHER PLANTATIONS
5781-52134-0034 THE DEVIL'S DREAM AND BLACK EYED SUSAN NO ONE CAN DESCRIBE THE INTENSE EMOTION IN THE NEGRO'S SOUL ON THOSE OCCASIONS WHEN THEY WERE TRYING TO PLEASE THEIR MASTERS AND MISTRESSES AFTER THE DANCING WAS OVER WE HAD OUR PRESENTS MASTER GIVING TO THE MEN
5781-52134-0035 AND MISTRESS TO THE WOMEN THEN THE SLAVES WOULD GO TO THEIR QUARTERS AND CONTINUE TO DANCE THE REST OF THE FIVE OR SIX DAYS AND WOULD SOMETIMES DANCE UNTIL EIGHT O'CLOCK SUNDAY MORNING THE CABINS WERE MOSTLY MADE OF LOGS AND THERE WERE LARGE CRACKS IN THEM
5781-52134-0036 YOU WOULD SEE THEM FILLING UP THE CRACKS WITH OLD RAGS THE IDEA WAS THAT IT WOULD NOT BE SUNDAY INSIDE IF THEY KEPT THE SUN OUT AND THUS THEY WOULD NOT DESECRATE THE SABBATH AND THESE THINGS CONTINUED UNTIL THE FREEDOM OF THE SLAVES
5781-52134-0037 PERHAPS MY READERS WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF MOST OF THE NEGROES WERE INCLINED TO VIOLATE THE SABBATH THEY WERE AS THE MASTERS WOULD MAKE THEM DO UNNECESSARY WORK THEY GOT INTO THE HABIT OF DISREGARDING THE DAY AS ONE FOR REST
5781-52134-0038 I REMEMBER WHEN A SMALL BOY I WENT INTO THE WOODS ONE SUNDAY MORNING WITH ONE OF MY FELLOW NEGROES WHOSE NAME WAS MUNSON
5781-52134-0039 HID IT UNDER THE LEAVES UNTIL NIGHT THEN TOOK IT HOME AND DRESSED IT THAT WAS THE ONLY TIME I KILLED A PIG BUT I KNEW OF THOUSANDS OF CASES LIKE THIS IN THE TIME OF SLAVERY
