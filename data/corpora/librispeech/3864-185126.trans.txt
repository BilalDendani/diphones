3864-185126-0000 IT IS ONE OF THE MOST CONVENIENTLY ACCESSIBLE OF THOSE POINTS OF INTEREST WITH WHICH GUIDE BOOKS SO ANXIOUSLY AND WITH SO MUCH PROPRIETY CONCERN THEMSELVES WHAT A TOURIST PRAYS FOR IS SOMETHING TO SEE
3864-185126-0001 IF I HAD EVER BEEN A TOURIST IN BOSTON NO DOUBT I SHOULD BEFORE NOW HAVE SURVEYED THE WORLD FROM THE TOP OF THE BUNKER HILL MONUMENT IN TALLAHASSEE AT ALL EVENTS I WENT TO THE MURAT ESTATE IN FACT I WENT MORE THAN ONCE
3864-185126-0002 BUT I REMEMBER ESPECIALLY MY FIRST VISIT WHICH HAD A LIVELIER SENTIMENTAL INTEREST THAN THE OTHERS BECAUSE I WAS THEN UNDER THE AGREEABLE DELUSION THAT THE PRINCE HIMSELF HAD LIVED THERE THE GUIDE BOOK TOLD ME SO
3864-185126-0003 VOUCHSAFING ALSO THE INFORMATION THAT AFTER BUILDING THE HOUSE HE INTERESTED HIMSELF ACTIVELY IN LOCAL AFFAIRS BECAME A NATURALIZED CITIZEN AND SERVED SUCCESSIVELY AS POSTMASTER ALDERMAN AND MAYOR A MODEL IMMIGRANT SURELY
3864-185126-0004 THOUGH IT IS RATHER THE WAY OF IMMIGRANTS PERHAPS NOT TO REFUSE POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITIES NATURALLY I REMEMBERED THESE THINGS AS I STOOD IN FRONT OF THE BIG HOUSE A STORY AND A HALF COTTAGE AMID THE FLOWERING SHRUBS
3864-185126-0005 HERE LIVED ONCE THE SON OF THE KING OF NAPLES HIMSELF A PRINCE AND WORTHY SON OF A WORTHY SIRE ALDERMAN AND THEN MAYOR OF THE CITY OF TALLAHASSEE THUS DID AN UNCOMPROMISING DEMOCRAT PAY COURT TO THE SHADES OF ROYALTY
3864-185126-0006 WHILE A MOCKING BIRD SANG FROM A FRINGE BUSH BY THE GATE AND AN ORIOLE FLEW MADLY FROM TREE TO TREE IN PURSUIT OF A FAIR CREATURE OF THE RELUCTANT SEX THE INCONSISTENCY IF SUCH IT WAS WAS QUICKLY PUNISHED FOR ALAS
3864-185126-0007 WHEN I SPOKE OF MY MORNING'S PILGRIMAGE TO AN OLD RESIDENT OF THE TOWN HE TOLD ME THAT MURAT NEVER LIVED IN THE HOUSE NOR ANYWHERE ELSE IN TALLAHASSEE AND OF COURSE WAS NEVER ITS POSTMASTER ALDERMAN OR MAYOR THE PRINCESS HE SAID
3864-185126-0008 BUILT THE HOUSE AFTER HER HUSBAND'S DEATH AND LIVED THERE A WIDOW I APPEALED TO THE GUIDE BOOK MY INFORMANT SNEERED POLITELY AND BROUGHT ME A STILL OLDER TALLAHASSEAN
3864-185126-0009 WHOSE VENERABLE NAME I AM SORRY TO HAVE FORGOTTEN AND THAT INDISPUTABLE CITIZEN CONFIRMED ALL THAT HIS NEIGHBOR HAD SAID FOR ONCE THE GUIDE BOOK COMPILER MUST HAVE BEEN MISINFORMED THE QUESTION HAPPILY WAS ONE OF NO GREAT CONSEQUENCE
3864-185126-0010 IF THE PRINCE HAD NEVER LIVED IN THE HOUSE THE PRINCESS HAD AND SHE BY ALL ACCOUNTS AND I MAKE CERTAIN HER HUSBAND WOULD HAVE SAID THE SAME WAS THE WORTHIER PERSON OF THE TWO AND EVEN IF NEITHER OF THEM HAD LIVED THERE IF MY SENTIMENT HAD BEEN ALL WASTED BUT THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF TEARS
3864-185126-0011 THE PLACE ITSELF WAS SIGHTLY THE HOUSE WAS OLD AND THE WAY THITHER A PLEASANT ONE FIRST DOWN THE HILL IN A ZIGZAG COURSE TO THE VICINITY OF THE RAILWAY STATION THEN BY A WINDING COUNTRY ROAD THROUGH THE VALLEY PAST A FEW NEGRO CABINS AND UP THE SLOPE
3864-185126-0012 ON THE FARTHER SIDE PRINCE MURAT OR NO PRINCE MURAT I SHOULD LOVE TO TRAVEL THAT ROAD TO DAY INSTEAD OF SITTING BEFORE A MASSACHUSETTS FIRE WITH THE GROUND DEEP UNDER SNOW AND THE AIR FULL OF THIRTY OR FORTY DEGREES OF FROST
3864-185126-0013 IN THE FRONT YARD OF ONE OF THE CABINS OPPOSITE THE CAR WHEEL FOUNDRY AND NEAR THE STATION AS I NOW REMEMBER A MIDDLE AGED NEGRESS WAS CUTTING UP AN OAK LOG SHE SWUNG THE AXE WITH VIGOR AND PRECISION AND THE CHIPS FLEW BUT I COULD NOT HELP SAYING
3864-185126-0014 YOU OUGHT TO MAKE THE MAN DO THAT SHE ANSWERED ON THE INSTANT I WOULD SHE SAID IF I HAD A MAN TO MAKE I'M SURE YOU WOULD I THOUGHT HER TONGUE WAS AS SHARP AS HER AXE OUGHT I TO HAVE VENTURED A WORD IN HER BEHALF I WONDER
3864-185126-0015 WHEN A MAN OF HER OWN COLOR AND A PRETTY NEAR NEIGHBOR TOLD ME WITH ADMIRABLE NAIVETE THE STORY OF HIS BEREAVEMENT AND HIS HOPES HIS WIFE HAD DIED A YEAR BEFORE HE SAID AND SO FAR THOUGH HE HAD NOT LET THE GRASS GROW UNDER HIS FEET HE HAD FOUND NO ONE TO TAKE HER PLACE
3864-185126-0016 HE STILL MEANT TO DO SO IF HE COULD HE WAS ONLY SEVENTY FOUR YEARS OLD AND IT WAS NOT GOOD FOR A MAN TO BE ALONE HE SEEMED A GENTLE SPIRIT AND I WITHHELD ALL MENTION OF THE STALWART AND MANLESS WOOD CUTTER I HOPE HE WENT FARTHER AND FARED BETTER
3864-185126-0017 SO YOUTHFUL AS HE WAS SURELY THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR HASTE WHEN I HAD SKIRTED A COTTON FIELD THE CROP JUST OUT OF THE GROUND AND A BIT OF WOOD ON THE RIGHT AND A SWAMP WITH A SPLENDID DISPLAY OF WHITE WATER LILIES ON THE LEFT AND HAD BEGUN TO ASCEND THE GENTLE SLOPE
3864-185126-0018 I MET A MAN OF CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN SEVENTY FOUR YEARS CAN YOU TELL ME JUST WHERE THE MURAT PLACE IS I INQUIRED HE GRINNED BROADLY AND THOUGHT HE COULD HE WAS ONE OF THE OLD MURAT SERVANTS AS HIS FATHER HAD BEEN BEFORE HIM I WAS BORNED ON TO HIM
3864-185126-0019 HE SAID SPEAKING OF THE PRINCE MURAT WAS A GENTLEMAN SAH THAT WAS A STATEMENT WHICH IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO REPEAT OFTEN ENOUGH HE SPOKE FROM A SLAVE'S POINT OF VIEW MURAT WAS A GOOD MASTER THE OLD MAN HAD HEARD HIM SAY THAT HE KEPT SERVANTS FOR THE LIKE OF THE THING
3864-185126-0020 HE DIDN'T ABUSE THEM HE NEVER WAS FOR BARBARIZING A POOR COLORED PERSON AT ALL WHIPPING OH YES HE DIDN'T MISS YOUR FAULT NO SAH HE DIDN'T MISS YOUR FAULT BUT HIS SERVANTS NEVER WERE IRONED HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN BARBAROUSMENT
3864-185126-0021 THE OLD MAN WAS THANKFUL TO BE FREE BUT TO HIS MIND EMANCIPATION HAD NOT MADE EVERYTHING HEAVENLY THE YOUNGER SET OF NEGROES MY PEOPLE WAS HIS WORD WERE ON THE WRONG ROAD THEY HAD SOLD THEIR BIRTHRIGHT
3864-185126-0022 THOUGH EXACTLY WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT REMARK I DID NOT GATHER THEY AIN'T GOT NO SENSE HE DECLARED AND WHAT SENSE THEY HAS GOT DON'T DO EM NO GOOD I TOLD HIM FINALLY THAT I WAS FROM THE NORTH OH I KNOWS IT HE EXCLAIMED I KNOWS IT
3864-185126-0023 AND HE BEAMED WITH DELIGHT HOW DID HE KNOW I INQUIRED OH I KNOWS IT I CAN SEE IT IN YOU
3864-185126-0024 YOU'S A PERFECT GENTLEMAN SAH HE WAS TOO OLD TO BE QUARRELED WITH AND I SWALLOWED THE COMPLIMENT I TORE MYSELF AWAY OR HE MIGHT HAVE RUN ON TILL NIGHT ABOUT HIS OLD MASTER AND MISTRESS THE DIVISION OF THE ESTATE AN ABUSIVE OVERSEER
3864-185126-0025 HE WAS A PERFECT DOG SAH AND SUNDRY OTHER THINGS HE HAD LIVED A LONG TIME AND HAD NOTHING TO DO NOW BUT TO RECALL THE PAST AND TELL IT OVER SO IT WILL BE WITH US IF WE LIVE SO LONG MAY WE FIND ONCE IN A WHILE A PATIENT LISTENER
3864-185126-0026 THIS PATRIARCH'S UNFAVORABLE OPINION AS TO THE PROSPECTS OF THE COLORED PEOPLE WAS SHARED BY MY HOPEFUL YOUNG WIDOWER BEFORE MENTIONED WHO EXPRESSED HIMSELF QUITE AS EMPHATICALLY HE WAS BROUGHT UP AMONG WHITE PEOPLE
3864-185126-0027 HE SAID AND BELIEVED THAT THE SALVATION OF THE BLACKS LAY IN THEIR RECOGNITION OF WHITE SUPREMACY BUT HE WAS LESS PERSPICACIOUS THAN THE OLDER MAN HE WAS ONE OF THE VERY FEW PERSONS WHOM I MET AT THE SOUTH WHO DID NOT RECOGNIZE ME AT SIGHT AS A YANKEE
3864-185126-0028 ARE YOU A LEGISLATOR MAN HE ASKED AT THE END OF OUR TALK THE LEGISLATURE WAS IN SESSION ON THE HILL BUT PERHAPS AFTER ALL HE ONLY MEANT TO FLATTER ME IF I AM LONG ON THE WAY IT IS BECAUSE AS I LOVE ALWAYS TO HAVE IT
3864-185126-0029 THE GOING AND COMING WERE THE BETTER PART OF THE PILGRIMAGE THE ESTATE ITSELF IS BEAUTIFULLY SITUATED WITH FAR AWAY HORIZONS BUT IT HAS FALLEN INTO GREAT NEGLECT WHILE THE HOUSE ALMOST IN RUINS AND OCCUPIED BY COLORED PEOPLE IS TO NORTHERN EYES
3864-185126-0030 HARDLY MORE THAN A LARGER CABIN IT PUT ME IN MIND OF THE QUESTION OF A WESTERN GENTLEMAN
3864-185126-0031 HE HAD COME TO FLORIDA AGAINST HIS WILL
3864-185126-0032 AND WAS LOOKING AT EVERYTHING THROUGH VERY BLUE SPECTACLES HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF THOSE FINE OLD COUNTRY MANSIONS HE ASKED ABOUT WHICH WE READ SO OFTEN IN DESCRIPTIONS OF SOUTHERN LIFE HE HAD BEEN ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THEM HE AVERRED EVER SINCE HE LEFT HOME
3864-185126-0033 AND HAD YET TO FIND THE FIRST ONE AND FROM HIS TONE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE THOUGHT THE SOUTHERN IDEA OF A FINE OLD MANSION MUST BE DIFFERENT FROM HIS THE MURAT HOUSE CERTAINLY WAS NEVER A PALACE EXCEPT AS LOVE MAY HAVE MADE IT SO
3864-185126-0034 BUT IT WAS OLD PEOPLE HAD LIVED IN IT AND DIED IN IT THOSE WHO ONCE OWNED IT WHOSE NAME AND MEMORY STILL CLUNG TO IT WERE NOW IN NARROWER HOUSES AND IT WAS EASY FOR THE VISITOR FOR ONE VISITOR AT LEAST TO FALL INTO PENSIVE MEDITATION
3864-185126-0035 I STROLLED ABOUT THE GROUNDS STOOD BETWEEN THE LAST YEAR'S COTTON ROWS WHILE A CAROLINA WREN POURED OUT HIS SOUL FROM AN OLEANDER BUSH NEAR BY ADMIRED THE CONFIDENCE OF A PAIR OF SHRIKES WHO HAD MADE A NEST IN A HONEYSUCKLE VINE IN THE FRONT YARD
3864-185126-0036 LISTENED TO THE SWEET MUSIC OF MOCKING BIRDS CARDINALS AND ORCHARD ORIOLES WATCHED THE MARTINS CIRCLING ABOVE THE TREES THOUGHT OF THE PRINCESS AND SMILED AT THE BLACK CHILDREN WHO THRUST THEIR HEADS OUT OF THE WINDOWS OF HER BIG HOUSE AND THEN WITH A SPRIG OF HONEYSUCKLE FOR A KEEPSAKE
3864-185126-0037 I STARTED SLOWLY HOMEWARD THE SUN BY THIS TIME WAS STRAIGHT OVERHEAD BUT MY UMBRELLA SAVED ME FROM ABSOLUTE DISCOMFORT WHILE BIRDS FURNISHED HERE AND THERE AN AGREEABLE DIVERSION
3864-185126-0038 I RECALL IN PARTICULAR SOME WHITE CROWNED SPARROWS THE FIRST ONES I HAD SEEN IN FLORIDA AT A BEND IN THE ROAD OPPOSITE THE WATER LILY SWAMP WHILE I WAS COOLING MYSELF IN THE SHADE OF A FRIENDLY PINE TREE
3864-185126-0039 ENJOYING AT THE SAME TIME A FENCE OVERRUN WITH CHEROKEE ROSES A MAN AND HIS LITTLE BOY CAME ALONG IN A WAGON THE MAN SEEMED REALLY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS GOING INTO TOWN INSTEAD OF COMING FROM IT IT WAS PRETTY WARM WEATHER FOR WALKING
3864-185126-0040 AND HE HAD MEANT TO OFFER ME A LIFT HE WAS A SCANDINAVIAN WHO HAD BEEN FOR SOME YEARS IN FLORIDA HE OWNED A GOOD FARM NOT FAR FROM THE MURAT ESTATE
3864-185126-0041 BUT HE THOUGHT A MAN WASN'T ANY BETTER OFF FOR OWNING TOO MUCH LAND HE TALKED OF HIS CROPS HIS CHILDREN THE CLIMATE AND SO ON ALL IN A CHEERFUL STRAIN PLEASANT TO HEAR IF THE PESSIMISTS ARE RIGHT WHICH MAY I BE KEPT FROM BELIEVING
3864-185126-0042 THE OPTIMISTS ARE CERTAINLY MORE COMFORTABLE TO LIVE WITH THOUGH IT BE ONLY FOR TEN MINUTES UNDER A ROADSIDE SHADE TREE WHEN I REACHED THE STREET CAR TRACK AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL THE ONE CAR WHICH PLIES BACK AND FORTH THROUGH THE CITY WAS IN ITS PLACE WITH THE DRIVER BESIDE IT
3864-185126-0043 BUT NO MULES ARE YOU GOING TO START DIRECTLY I ASKED YES SAH HE ANSWERED AND THEN LOOKING TOWARD THE STABLE HE SHOUTED IN A PEREMPTORY VOICE DO ABOUT THERE DO ABOUT
3864-185126-0044 YES SAH THAT'S IT TAIN'T EVERYBODY THAT WANTS TO BE HURRIED UP SO WE TELLS EM DO ABOUT
3864-185126-0045 AS I SAW MORE OF HIM I AIN'T DE BOSS BUT I'S GOT RIGHT SMART TO SAY
