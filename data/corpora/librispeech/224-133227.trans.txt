224-133227-0000 THEOSOPHY MUCH IS SAID NOWADAYS ABOUT THEOSOPHY WHICH IS REALLY BUT ANOTHER NAME FOR MYSTICISM IT IS NOT A PHILOSOPHY FOR IT WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH PHILOSOPHICAL METHODS IT MIGHT BE CALLED A RELIGION
224-133227-0001 THOUGH IT HAS NEVER HAD A FOLLOWING LARGE ENOUGH TO MAKE A VERY STRONG IMPRESSION ON THE WORLD'S RELIGIOUS HISTORY THE NAME IS FROM THE GREEK WORD THEOSOPHIA DIVINE WISDOM
224-133227-0002 AND THE OBJECT OF THEOSOPHICAL STUDY IS PROFESSEDLY TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF DIVINE THINGS IT DIFFERS HOWEVER FROM BOTH PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY EVEN WHEN THESE HAVE THE SAME OBJECT OF INVESTIGATION FOR
224-133227-0003 IN SEEKING TO LEARN THE DIVINE NATURE AND ATTRIBUTES PHILOSOPHY EMPLOYS THE METHODS AND PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL REASONING THEOLOGY USES THESE ADDING TO THEM CERTAIN PRINCIPLES DERIVED FROM REVELATION
224-133227-0004 THEOSOPHY ON THE OTHER HAND PROFESSES TO EXCLUDE ALL REASONING PROCESSES AS IMPERFECT AND TO DERIVE ITS KNOWLEDGE FROM DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH GOD HIMSELF IT DOES NOT THEREFORE
224-133227-0005 ACCEPT THE TRUTHS OF RECORDED REVELATION AS IMMUTABLE BUT AS SUBJECT TO MODIFICATION BY LATER AND PERSONAL REVELATIONS THE THEOSOPHICAL IDEA HAS HAD FOLLOWERS FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES
224-133227-0006 SINCE THE CHRISTIAN ERA WE MAY CLASS AMONG THEOSOPHISTS SUCH SECTS AS NEO PLATONISTS THE HESYCHASTS OF THE GREEK CHURCH THE MYSTICS OF MEDIAEVAL TIMES AND IN LATER TIMES THE DISCIPLES OF PARACELSUS
224-133227-0007 THALHAUSER BOHME SWEDENBORG AND OTHERS RECENTLY A SMALL SECT HAS ARISEN WHICH HAS TAKEN THE NAME OF THEOSOPHISTS
224-133227-0008 TAKING A FEW OF HIS FOLLOWERS TO INDIA THEY HAVE BEEN PROSECUTING THEIR STUDIES THERE CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS ATTRACTING CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION BY A CLAIM TO MIRACULOUS POWERS
224-133227-0009 IT NEED HARDLY BE SAID THAT THE REVELATIONS THEY HAVE CLAIMED TO RECEIVE HAVE BEEN THUS FAR WITHOUT ELEMENT OF BENEFIT TO THE HUMAN RACE THE EVOLUTION THEORY
224-133227-0010 THE EVOLUTION OR DEVELOPMENT THEORY DECLARES THE UNIVERSE AS IT NOW EXISTS TO BE THE RESULT OF A LONG SERIES OF CHANGES WHICH WERE SO FAR RELATED TO EACH OTHER AS TO FORM A SERIES OF GROWTHS ANALOGOUS TO THE EVOLVING OF THE PARTS OF A GROWING ORGANISM
224-133227-0011 HERBERT SPENCER DEFINES EVOLUTION AS A PROGRESS FROM THE HOMOGENEOUS TO THE HETEROGENEOUS FROM GENERAL TO SPECIAL FROM THE SIMPLE TO THE COMPLEX ELEMENTS OF LIFE
224-133227-0012 AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS PROCESS CAN BE TRACED IN THE FORMATION OF WORLDS IN SPACE IN THE MULTIPLICATION OF TYPES AND SPECIES AMONG ANIMALS AND PLANTS IN THE ORIGIN AND CHANGES OF LANGUAGES AND LITERATURE AND THE ARTS
224-133227-0013 ASSERTING THE GENERAL FACT OF PROGRESS IN NATURE THE EVOLUTION THEORY SHOWS THAT THE METHOD OF THIS PROGRESS HAS BEEN ONE BY THE MULTIPLICATION OF ORGANS AND FUNCTIONS TWO
224-133227-0014 ACCORDING TO A DEFINED UNITY OF PLAN ALTHOUGH WITH THREE INTERVENTION OF TRANSITIONAL FORMS AND FOUR WITH MODIFICATIONS DEPENDENT UPON SURROUNDING CONDITIONS
224-133227-0015 BUT AS A THEORY EVOLUTION BELONGS TO THE ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY LEIBNITZ IN THE LATTER PART OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY FIRST UTTERED THE OPINION THAT THE EARTH WAS ONCE IN A FLUID CONDITION
224-133227-0016 AND KANT ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY DEFINITELY PROPOUNDED THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS WHICH WAS ENLARGED AS A THEORY BY THE HERSCHELS THE FIRST WRITER TO SUGGEST THE TRANSMUTATION OF SPECIES AMONG ANIMALS WAS BUFFON
224-133227-0017 ABOUT SEVENTEEN FIFTY AND OTHER WRITERS FOLLOWED OUT THE IDEA THE ECCENTRIC LORD MONBODDO WAS THE FIRST TO SUGGEST THE POSSIBLE DESCENT OF MAN FROM THE APE ABOUT SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FOUR IN EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN
224-133227-0018 DOCTOR W C WELLS FIRST PROPOSED TO APPLY THE PRINCIPLE OF NATURAL SELECTION TO THE NATURAL HISTORY OF MAN AND IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWO PROFESSOR HERBERT FIRST ASSERTED THE PROBABLE TRANSMUTATION OF SPECIES OF PLANTS
224-133227-0019 WHICH THOUGH EVIDENTLY NOT WRITTEN BY A SCIENTIFIC STUDENT YET ATTRACTED GREAT ATTENTION BY ITS BOLD AND INGENIOUS THEORIES THE AUTHORSHIP OF THIS BOOK WAS NEVER REVEALED UNTIL AFTER THE DEATH OF ROBERT CHAMBERS
224-133227-0020 A FEW YEARS SINCE IT BECAME KNOWN THAT THIS PUBLISHER WHOM NO ONE WOULD EVER HAVE SUSPECTED OF HOLDING SUCH HETERODOX THEORIES HAD ACTUALLY WRITTEN IT BUT THE TWO GREAT APOSTLES OF THE EVOLUTION THEORY
224-133227-0021 WERE CHARLES DARWIN AND HERBERT SPENCER THE LATTER BEGAN HIS GREAT WORK THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF PHILOSOPHY
224-133227-0022 IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE APPEARED DARWIN'S ORIGIN OF SPECIES THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE LATTER WAS THAT DIFFERENT SPECIES ORIGINATED IN SPONTANEOUS VARIATION
224-133227-0023 AND THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST THROUGH NATURAL SELECTION AND THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE THIS THEORY WAS FURTHER ELABORATED AND APPLIED BY SPENCER DARWIN HUXLEY
224-133227-0024 EVOLUTION AS A PRINCIPLE IS NOW ACKNOWLEDGED BY NEARLY ALL SCIENTISTS IT IS TAKEN TO BE AN ESTABLISHED FACT IN NATURE A VALID INDUCTION FROM MAN'S KNOWLEDGE OF NATURAL ORDER THE ENGLISH SPARROW
224-133227-0025 THE FIRST ENGLISH SPARROW WAS BROUGHT TO THE UNITED STATES IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THAT THE SPECIES CAN BE SAID TO HAVE FIRMLY ESTABLISHED ITSELF
224-133227-0026 SINCE THEN IT HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE COUNTRY ITS FECUNDITY IS AMAZING IN THE LATITUDE OF NEW YORK AND SOUTHWARD IT HATCHES AS A RULE FIVE OR SIX BROODS IN A SEASON
224-133227-0027 WITH FROM FOUR TO SIX YOUNG IN A BROOD ASSUMING THE AVERAGE ANNUAL PRODUCT OF A PAIR TO BE TWENTY FOUR YOUNG OF WHICH HALF ARE FEMALES AND HALF MALES
224-133227-0028 AND ASSUMING FURTHER FOR THE SAKE OF COMPUTATION THAT ALL LIVE TOGETHER WITH THEIR OFFSPRING IT WILL BE SEEN THAT IN TEN YEARS THE PROGENY OF A SINGLE PAIR
224-133227-0029 FEMININE HEIGHT AND WEIGHT IT IS OFTEN ASKED HOW STOUT A WOMAN OUGHT TO BE IN PROPORTION TO HER HEIGHT A VERY YOUNG GIRL MAY BECOMINGLY BE THINNER THAN A MATRON
224-133227-0030 BUT THE FOLLOWING TABLE GIVES A FAIR INDICATION OF PROPER PROPORTIONS
224-133227-0031 WHEN A MAN BECOMES OF AGE THE QUESTION SOMETIMES ARISES WHETHER IT MAN IS ENTITLED TO VOTE AT AN ELECTION HELD ON THE DAY PRECEDING THE TWENTY FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF HIS BIRTH
224-133227-0032 FULL AGE IN MALE OR FEMALE IS TWENTY ONE YEARS WHICH AGE IS COMPLETED ON THE DAY PRECEDING THE ANNIVERSARY OF A PERSON'S BIRTH
224-133227-0033 THE LATE CHIEF JUSTICE SHARSWOOD IN HIS EDITION OF BLACKSTONE'S COMMENTARIES QUOTES CHRISTIAN'S NOTE
224-133227-0034 IF HE IS BORN ON THE SIXTEENTH DAY OF FEBRUARY SIXTEEN O EIGHT HE IS OF AGE TO DO ANY LEGAL ACT ON THE MORNING OF THE FIFTEENTH OF FEBRUARY SIXTEEN TWENTY NINE THOUGH HE MAY NOT HAVE LIVED TWENTY ONE YEARS BY NEARLY FORTY EIGHT HOURS
224-133227-0035 THE REASON ASSIGNED IS THAT IN LAW THERE IS NO FRACTION OF A DAY AND IF THE BIRTH WERE ON THE LAST SECOND OF ONE DAY AND THE ACT ON THE FIRST SECOND OF THE PRECEDING DAY TWENTY ONE YEARS AFTER
