2526-156061-0000 THE FOLLOWING HISTORY IS GIVEN IN A SERIES OF LETTERS WRITTEN PRINCIPALLY IN A DOUBLE YET SEPARATE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN TWO YOUNG LADIES OF VIRTUE AND HONOR BEARING AN INVIOLABLE FRIENDSHIP FOR EACH OTHER
2526-156061-0001 AND BETWEEN TWO GENTLEMEN OF FREE LIVES ONE OF THEM GLORYING IN HIS TALENTS FOR STRATAGEM AND INVENTION AND COMMUNICATING TO THE OTHER IN CONFIDENCE ALL THE SECRET PURPOSES OF AN INTRIGUING HEAD AND RESOLUTE HEART
2526-156061-0002 BUT HERE IT WILL BE PROPER TO OBSERVE
2526-156061-0003 AND MAKING IT ONE OF THEIR WICKED MAXIMS TO KEEP NO FAITH WITH ANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS OF IT WHO ARE THROWN INTO THEIR POWER ARE NOT HOWEVER EITHER INFIDELS OR SCOFFERS NOR YET SUCH AS THINK THEMSELVES
2526-156061-0004 FREED FROM THE OBSERVANCE OF THOSE OTHER MORAL DUTIES WHICH BIND MAN TO MAN ON THE CONTRARY
2526-156061-0005 THAT THEY VERY OFTEN MAKE SUCH REFLECTIONS UPON EACH OTHER AND EACH UPON HIMSELF AND HIS OWN ACTIONS AS REASONABLE BEINGS MUST MAKE WHO DISBELIEVE NOT A FUTURE STATE OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AND WHO ONE DAY PROPOSE TO REFORM
2526-156061-0006 PRESERVES A DECENCY AS WELL IN HIS IMAGES AS IN HIS LANGUAGE
2526-156061-0007 WRITERS WHOSE SUBJECTS AND CHARACTERS HAVE LESS WARRANTED THE LIBERTIES THEY HAVE TAKEN IN THE LETTERS OF THE TWO YOUNG LADIES IT IS PRESUMED
2526-156061-0008 WILL BE FOUND NOT ONLY THE HIGHEST EXERCISE OF A REASONABLE AND PRACTICABLE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN MINDS ENDOWED WITH THE NOBLEST PRINCIPLES OF VIRTUE AND RELIGION BUT OCCASIONALLY INTERSPERSED SUCH DELICACY OF SENTIMENTS PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE OTHER SEX
2526-156061-0009 SUCH INSTANCES OF IMPARTIALITY EACH FREELY AS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP BLAMING PRAISING
2526-156061-0010 THAT SHE IS NOT IN ALL RESPECTS A PERFECT CHARACTER IT WAS NOT ONLY NATURAL BUT IT WAS NECESSARY THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE SOME FAULTS WERE IT ONLY TO SHOW THE READER HOW LAUDABLY SHE COULD MISTRUST AND BLAME HERSELF
2526-156061-0011 AND CARRY TO HER OWN HEART DIVESTED OF SELF PARTIALITY THE CENSURE WHICH AROSE FROM HER OWN CONVICTIONS AND THAT EVEN TO THE ACQUITTAL OF THOSE BECAUSE REVERED CHARACTERS WHOM NO ONE ELSE WOULD ACQUIT
2526-156061-0012 HER ERRORS WERE OWING AND NOT TO A WEAK OR REPROACHABLE HEART AS FAR AS IT IS CONSISTENT WITH HUMAN FRAILTY AND AS FAR AS SHE COULD BE PERFECT
2526-156061-0013 AND THOSE WITH WHOM SHE WAS INSEPARABLY CONNECTED SHE IS PERFECT TO HAVE BEEN IMPECCABLE MUST HAVE LEFT NOTHING FOR THE DIVINE GRACE AND A PURIFIED STATE TO DO
2526-156061-0014 FROM WOMAN TO ANGEL AS SUCH IS SHE OFTEN ESTEEMED BY THE MAN WHOSE HEART WAS SO CORRUPT THAT HE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HUMAN NATURE CAPABLE OF THE PURITY WHICH ON EVERY TRIAL OR TEMPTATION
2526-156061-0015 SUCH STROKES OF GAYETY FANCY AND HUMOUR AS WILL ENTERTAIN AND DIVERT AND AT THE SAME TIME BOTH WARN AND INSTRUCT ALL THE LETTERS ARE WRITTEN WHILE THE HEARTS OF THE WRITERS MUST BE SUPPOSED TO BE WHOLLY ENGAGED IN THEIR SUBJECTS
2526-156061-0016 THE EVENTS AT THE TIME GENERALLY DUBIOUS SO THAT THEY ABOUND NOT ONLY IN CRITICAL SITUATIONS BUT WITH WHAT MAY BE CALLED INSTANTANEOUS DESCRIPTIONS AND REFLECTIONS
2526-156061-0017 PROPER TO BE BROUGHT HOME TO THE BREAST OF THE YOUTHFUL READER AS ALSO WITH AFFECTING CONVERSATIONS MANY OF THEM WRITTEN IN THE DIALOGUE OR DRAMATIC WAY MUCH MORE LIVELY AND AFFECTING
2526-156061-0018 MUST BE THE STYLE OF THOSE WHO WRITE IN THE HEIGHT OF A PRESENT DISTRESS THE MIND TORTURED BY THE PANGS OF UNCERTAINTY THE EVENTS THEN HIDDEN IN THE WOMB OF FATE THAN THE DRY NARRATIVE
2526-156061-0019 RELATING DIFFICULTIES AND DANGER SURMOUNTED CAN BE THE RELATER PERFECTLY AT EASE AND IF HIMSELF UNMOVED BY HIS OWN STORY NOT LIKELY GREATLY TO AFFECT THE READER
2526-156061-0020 WHAT WILL BE FOUND TO BE MORE PARTICULARLY AIMED AT IN THE FOLLOWING WORK IS TO WARN THE INCONSIDERATE AND THOUGHTLESS OF THE ONE SEX
2526-156061-0021 AGAINST PREFERRING A MAN OF PLEASURE TO A MAN OF PROBITY UPON THAT DANGEROUS BUT TOO COMMONLY RECEIVED NOTION
2526-156061-0022 BUT ABOVE ALL TO INVESTIGATE THE HIGHEST AND MOST IMPORTANT DOCTRINES NOT ONLY OF MORALITY BUT OF CHRISTIANITY BY SHOWING THEM THROWN INTO ACTION IN THE CONDUCT OF THE WORTHY CHARACTERS WHILE THE UNWORTHY
2526-156061-0023 ARE CONDIGNLY AND AS MAY BE SAID CONSEQUENTIALLY PUNISHED FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID CONSIDERATE READERS WILL NOT ENTER UPON THE PERUSAL OF THE PIECE BEFORE THEM
2526-156061-0024 EXPECTING A LIGHT NOVEL OR TRANSITORY ROMANCE AND LOOK UPON STORY IN IT INTERESTING AS THAT IS GENERALLY ALLOWED TO BE AS ITS SOLE END RATHER THAN AS A VEHICLE TO THE INSTRUCTION
