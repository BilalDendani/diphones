7150-2338-0000 MORLVERA THE OLYMPIC TOY EMPORIUM OCCUPIED A CONSPICUOUS FRONTAGE IN AN IMPORTANT WEST END STREET
7150-2338-0001 IT WAS HAPPILY NAMED TOY EMPORIUM BECAUSE ONE WOULD NEVER HAVE DREAMED OF ACCORDING IT THE FAMILIAR AND YET PULSE QUICKENING NAME OF TOYSHOP THERE WAS AN AIR OF COLD SPLENDOUR AND ELABORATE FAILURE ABOUT THE WARES THAT WERE SET OUT IN ITS AMPLE WINDOWS
7150-2338-0002 THEY WERE THE SORT OF TOYS THAT A TIRED SHOP ASSISTANT DISPLAYS AND EXPLAINS AT CHRISTMAS TIME TO EXCLAMATORY PARENTS AND BORED SILENT CHILDREN
7150-2338-0003 THE ANIMAL TOYS LOOKED MORE LIKE NATURAL HISTORY MODELS THAN THE COMFORTABLE SYMPATHETIC COMPANIONS THAT ONE WOULD WISH AT A CERTAIN AGE TO TAKE TO BED WITH ONE AND TO SMUGGLE INTO THE BATH ROOM
7150-2338-0004 IT WAS A MERCIFUL REFLECTION THAT IN ANY RIGHT MINDED NURSERY THE LIFETIME WOULD CERTAINLY BE SHORT PROMINENT AMONG THE ELEGANTLY DRESSED DOLLS THAT FILLED AN ENTIRE SECTION OF THE WINDOW FRONTAGE
7150-2338-0005 SHE LACKED NOTHING THAT IS TO BE FOUND IN A CAREFULLY DETAILED FASHION PLATE IN FACT SHE MIGHT BE SAID TO HAVE SOMETHING MORE THAN THE AVERAGE FASHION PLATE FEMALE POSSESSES IN PLACE OF A VACANT EXPRESSIONLESS STARE SHE HAD CHARACTER IN HER FACE
7150-2338-0006 IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT IT WAS BAD CHARACTER COLD HOSTILE INQUISITORIAL WITH A SINISTER LOWERING OF ONE EYEBROW AND A MERCILESS HARDNESS ABOUT THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH
7150-2338-0007 ONE MIGHT HAVE IMAGINED HISTORIES ABOUT HER BY THE HOUR HISTORIES IN WHICH UNWORTHY AMBITION THE DESIRE FOR MONEY AND AN ENTIRE ABSENCE OF ALL DECENT FEELING WOULD PLAY A CONSPICUOUS PART
7150-2338-0008 AND BERT AGED SEVEN HAD HALTED ON THE WAY FROM THEIR OBSCURE BACK STREET TO THE MINNOW STOCKED WATER OF SAINT JAMES'S PARK AND WERE CRITICALLY EXAMINING THE HOBBLE SKIRTED DOLL
7150-2338-0009 AND DISSECTING HER CHARACTER IN NO VERY TOLERANT SPIRIT THERE IS PROBABLY A LATENT ENMITY BETWEEN THE NECESSARILY UNDER CLAD AND THE UNNECESSARILY OVERDRESSED
7150-2338-0010 BUT A LITTLE KINDNESS AND GOOD FELLOWSHIP ON THE PART OF THE LATTER WILL OFTEN CHANGE THE SENTIMENT TO ADMIRING DEVOTION IF THE LADY IN PEACH COLOURED VELVET AND LEOPARD SKIN HAD WORN A PLEASANT EXPRESSION IN ADDITION TO HER OTHER ELABORATE FURNISHINGS
7150-2338-0011 EMMELINE AT LEAST MIGHT HAVE RESPECTED AND EVEN LOVED HER AS IT WAS SHE GAVE HER A HORRIBLE REPUTATION BASED CHIEFLY ON A SECONDHAND KNOWLEDGE OF GILDED DEPRAVITY
7150-2338-0012 DERIVED FROM THE CONVERSATION OF THOSE WHO WERE SKILLED IN THE ART OF NOVELETTE READING BERT FILLED IN A FEW DAMAGING DETAILS FROM HIS OWN LIMITED IMAGINATION SHE'S A BAD LOT THAT ONE IS DECLARED EMMELINE AFTER A LONG UNFRIENDLY STARE
7150-2338-0013 E KNOCKS ER ABART SAID BERT WITH ENTHUSIASM NO E DON'T COS E'S DEAD SHE POISONED IM SLOW AND GRADUAL SO THAT NOBODY DIDN'T KNOW NOW SHE WANTS TO MARRY A LORD WITH EAPS AND EAPS OF MONEY
7150-2338-0014 BUT SHE'S GOING TO POISON ER TOO SHE'S A BAD LOT SAID BERT WITH GROWING HOSTILITY ER MOTHER ATES HER AND SHE'S AFRAID OF ER TOO COS SHE'S GOT A SERKESTIC TONGUE ALWAYS TALKING SERKESMS SHE IS
7150-2338-0015 SHE'S GREEDY TOO IF THERE'S FISH GOING SHE EATS ER OWN SHARE AND ER LITTLE GIRL'S AS WELL
7150-2338-0016 SHE AD A LITTLE BOY ONCE SAID BERT BUT SHE PUSHED IM INTO THE WATER WHEN NOBODY WASN'T LOOKING
7150-2338-0017 THEY ILL TREAT IM SOMETHINK CRUEL
7150-2338-0018 SAID EMMELINE THINKING HARD ER NIME'S MORLVERA IT WAS AS NEAR AS SHE COULD GET TO THE NAME OF AN ADVENTURESS WHO FIGURED PROMINENTLY IN A CINEMA DRAMA
7150-2338-0019 THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT WHILE THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE NAME WERE TURNED OVER IN THE CHILDREN'S MINDS
7150-2338-0020 SHE THINKS SHE'LL GET THE RICH LORD TO PAY FOR EM BUT E WON'T
7150-2338-0021 E WON'T PAY FOR THE CLOTHES SAID BERT WITH CONVICTION EVIDENTLY THERE WAS SOME LIMIT TO THE WEAK GOOD NATURE OF WEALTHY LORDS AT THAT MOMENT A MOTOR CARRIAGE WITH LIVERIED SERVANTS DREW UP AT THE EMPORIUM ENTRANCE
7150-2338-0022 FOLLOWED SLOWLY AND SULKILY BY A SMALL BOY WHO HAD A VERY BLACK SCOWL ON HIS FACE AND A VERY WHITE SAILOR SUIT OVER THE REST OF HIM THE LADY WAS CONTINUING AN ARGUMENT WHICH HAD PROBABLY COMMENCED IN PORTMAN SQUARE
7150-2338-0023 NOW VICTOR YOU ARE TO COME IN AND BUY A NICE DOLL FOR YOUR COUSIN BERTHA SHE GAVE YOU A BEAUTIFUL BOX OF SOLDIERS ON YOUR BIRTHDAY AND YOU MUST GIVE HER A PRESENT ON HERS
7150-2338-0024 BERTHA IS A FAT LITTLE FOOL SAID VICTOR IN A VOICE THAT WAS AS LOUD AS HIS MOTHER'S AND HAD MORE ASSURANCE IN IT VICTOR YOU ARE NOT TO SAY SUCH THINGS BERTHA IS NOT A FOOL AND SHE IS NOT IN THE LEAST FAT
7150-2338-0025 YOU ARE TO COME IN AND CHOOSE A DOLL FOR HER THE COUPLE PASSED INTO THE SHOP OUT OF VIEW AND HEARING OF THE TWO BACK STREET CHILDREN MY HE IS IN A WICKED TEMPER EXCLAIMED EMMELINE
7150-2338-0026 BUT BOTH SHE AND BERT WERE INCLINED TO SIDE WITH HIM AGAINST THE ABSENT BERTHA WHO WAS DOUBTLESS AS FAT AND FOOLISH AS HE HAD DESCRIBED HER TO BE
7150-2338-0027 IT'S FOR A LITTLE GIRL OF ELEVEN A FAT LITTLE GIRL OF ELEVEN ADDED VICTOR BY WAY OF SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION VICTOR IF YOU SAY SUCH RUDE THINGS ABOUT YOUR COUSIN YOU SHALL GO TO BED THE MOMENT WE GET HOME WITHOUT HAVING ANY TEA
7150-2338-0028 THIS IS ONE OF THE NEWEST THINGS WE HAVE IN DOLLS SAID THE ASSISTANT REMOVING A HOBBLE SKIRTED FIGURE IN PEACH COLOURED VELVET FROM THE WINDOW
7150-2338-0029 THEY'VE BIN AND TOOK MORLVERA THERE WAS A MINGLING OF EXCITEMENT AND A CERTAIN SENSE OF BEREAVEMENT IN HER MIND SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GAZE AT THAT EMBODIMENT OF OVERDRESSED DEPRAVITY FOR JUST A LITTLE LONGER
7150-2338-0030 I SPECT SHE'S GOING AWAY IN A KERRIDGE TO MARRY THE RICH LORD HAZARDED BERT SHE'S UP TO NO GOOD SAID EMMELINE VAGUELY INSIDE THE SHOP THE PURCHASE OF THE DOLL HAD BEEN DECIDED ON
7150-2338-0031 OH VERY WELL SAID VICTOR SULKILY YOU NEEDN'T HAVE IT STUCK INTO A BOX AND WAIT AN HOUR WHILE IT'S BEING DONE UP INTO A PARCEL I'LL TAKE IT AS IT IS AND WE CAN GO ROUND TO MANCHESTER SQUARE AND GIVE IT TO BERTHA AND GET THE THING DONE WITH
7150-2338-0032 THAT WILL SAVE ME THE TROUBLE OF WRITING FOR DEAR BERTHA WITH VICTOR'S LOVE ON A BIT OF PAPER VERY WELL SAID HIS MOTHER WE CAN GO TO MANCHESTER SQUARE ON OUR WAY HOME
7150-2338-0033 I WON'T LET THE LITTLE BEAST KISS ME STIPULATED VICTOR HIS MOTHER SAID NOTHING VICTOR HAD NOT BEEN HALF AS TROUBLESOME AS SHE HAD ANTICIPATED WHEN HE CHOSE HE COULD REALLY BE DREADFULLY NAUGHTY
7150-2338-0034 EMMELINE AND BERT WERE JUST MOVING AWAY FROM THE WINDOW WHEN MORLVERA MADE HER EXIT FROM THE SHOP VERY CAREFULLY IN VICTOR'S ARMS A LOOK OF SINISTER TRIUMPH SEEMED TO GLOW IN HER HARD INQUISITORIAL FACE
7150-2338-0035 AS FOR VICTOR A CERTAIN SCORNFUL SERENITY HAD REPLACED THE EARLIER SCOWLS HE HAD EVIDENTLY ACCEPTED DEFEAT WITH A CONTEMPTUOUS GOOD GRACE
7150-2338-0036 THE TALL LADY GAVE A DIRECTION TO THE FOOTMAN AND SETTLED HERSELF IN THE CARRIAGE THE LITTLE FIGURE IN THE WHITE SAILOR SUIT CLAMBERED IN BESIDE HER STILL CAREFULLY HOLDING THE ELEGANTLY GARBED DOLL
7150-2338-0037 THE CAR HAD TO BE BACKED A FEW YARDS IN THE PROCESS OF TURNING VERY STEALTHILY VERY GENTLY VERY MERCILESSLY VICTOR SENT MORLVERA FLYING OVER HIS SHOULDER
7150-2338-0038 SO THAT SHE FELL INTO THE ROAD JUST BEHIND THE RETROGRESSING WHEEL WITH A SOFT PLEASANT SOUNDING SCRUNCH THE CAR WENT OVER THE PROSTRATE FORM THEN IT MOVED FORWARD AGAIN WITH ANOTHER SCRUNCH
7150-2338-0039 THE CARRIAGE MOVED OFF AND LEFT BERT AND EMMELINE GAZING IN SCARED DELIGHT AT A SORRY MESS OF PETROL SMEARED VELVET SAWDUST AND LEOPARD SKIN WHICH WAS ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE HATEFUL MORLVERA
7150-2338-0040 THEY GAVE A SHRILL CHEER AND THEN RACED AWAY SHUDDERING FROM THE SCENE OF SO MUCH RAPIDLY ENACTED TRAGEDY LATER THAT AFTERNOON WHEN THEY WERE ENGAGED IN THE PURSUIT OF MINNOWS BY THE WATERSIDE IN SAINT JAMES'S PARK
7150-2338-0041 EMMELINE SAID IN A SOLEMN UNDERTONE TO BERT I'VE BIN FINKING DO YOU KNOW OO E WAS E WAS ER LITTLE BOY WOT SHE'D SENT AWAY TO LIVE WIV POOR FOLKS
