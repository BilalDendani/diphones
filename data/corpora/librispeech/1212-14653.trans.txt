1212-14653-0025 NANCY OLDEN I SAID TO MYSELF MORE IN SORROW THAN IN ANGER YOU'VE MET YOUR MATCH RIGHT HERE WHEN A WOMAN KNOWS A FACT AND STATES IT WITH SUCH QUIET CONVICTION WITHOUT THE LEAST UNNECESSARY EMPHASIS AND NOT A SUPERFLUOUS WORD
1212-14653-0026 I SAID HUMBLY I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T BE LIKELY TO MAKE A MISTAKE BUT JUST TO CONVINCE ME DO YOU MIND LETTING ME GO BACK TO LOOK NOT AT ALL SHE SAID PLACIDLY IF I GO WITH YOU THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD NOT LOOK

1212-14653-0030 SHE OUGHT TO BE RULING EMPIRES INSTEAD OF SEARCHING THIEVES LOOK AT THE BALANCE OF HER MAG MY BEST ACTING HADN'T SHAKEN HER
1212-14653-0031 WE'LL CALL THEM THE TEMPORARILY UN STRAIGHT SHE WAS SATISFIED JUST NOT TO LET ME GET AHEAD OF HER IN THE LEAST PARTICULAR BUT SHE WASN'T MEAN AND SHE WOULD LEND ME A NICKEL NOT AN EMOTIONALLY EXTRAVAGANT TEN CENT PIECE BUT JUST A NICKEL
1212-14653-0032 ON THE CHANCE THAT I WAS WHAT I SEEMED TO BE OH I DID ADMIRE HER
1212-14653-0033 I TOOK THE NICKEL AND THANKED HER BUT EFFUSIVENESS LEFT HER UNMOVED A WHOLESOME BLUE GOWNED ROCK WITH A NEAT FULL BIBBED WHITE APRON THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS AND STILL I LINGERED FANCY NANCE OLDEN JUST HEARTBROKEN AT BEING COMPELLED TO LEAVE A POLICE STATION
1212-14653-0034 THE WOMAN'S PATIENT HAND ON THE KNOB AND HER WATCHFUL EYES ON ME THAT I ACTUALLY MAG I ACTUALLY DIDN'T HEAR THE MATRON'S VOICE THE FIRST TIME SHE SPOKE THE SECOND TIME THOUGH I TURNED SO HAPPY I COULD NOT KEEP THE TREMOR OUT OF MY VOICE
1212-14653-0035 THE ADMIRABLE DRAGON IN THE BLUE DRESS DIDN'T WAVER A BIT BECAUSE HER SUPERIOR SPOKE PLEASANTLY TO ME SHE ONLY WATCHED AND LISTENED WHICH PUTS YOU IN A DIFFICULT POSITION WHEN YOUR NAME'S NANCE OLDEN YOU HAVE TO TELL THE TRUTH I'VE BEEN DETAINED
