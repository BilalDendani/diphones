8199-289915-0000 SHE COULD GO TO SPANISH JOHNNY'S AND SING PART SONGS WITH THE MEXICANS AND NOBODY OBJECTED THEA WAS STILL UNDER THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF TEACHING AND WAS TERRIBLY IN EARNEST ABOUT IT
8199-289915-0001 IF A PUPIL DID NOT GET ON WELL SHE FUMED AND FRETTED SHE COUNTED UNTIL SHE WAS HOARSE SHE LISTENED TO SCALES IN HER SLEEP WUNSCH HAD TAUGHT ONLY ONE PUPIL SERIOUSLY BUT THEA TAUGHT
8199-289915-0002 TWENTY THE DULLER THEY WERE THE MORE FURIOUSLY SHE POKED AND PRODDED THEM WITH THE LITTLE GIRLS SHE WAS NEARLY ALWAYS PATIENT BUT WITH PUPILS OLDER THAN HERSELF SHE SOMETIMES LOST HER TEMPER
8199-289915-0003 ONE OF HER MISTAKES WAS TO LET HERSELF IN FOR A CALLING DOWN FROM MISSUS LIVERY JOHNSON THAT LADY APPEARED AT THE KRONBORGS ONE MORNING AND ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WOULD ALLOW NO GIRL TO STAMP HER FOOT AT HER DAUGHTER GRACE
8199-289915-0004 SHE ADDED THAT THEA'S BAD MANNERS WITH THE OLDER GIRLS WERE BEING TALKED ABOUT ALL OVER TOWN AND THAT IF HER TEMPER DID NOT SPEEDILY IMPROVE SHE WOULD LOSE ALL HER ADVANCED PUPILS
8199-289915-0005 THEA WAS FRIGHTENED SHE FELT SHE COULD NEVER BEAR THE DISGRACE IF SUCH A THING HAPPENED BESIDES WHAT WOULD HER FATHER SAY AFTER HE HAD GONE TO THE EXPENSE OF BUILDING AN ADDITION TO THE HOUSE
8199-289915-0006 MISSUS JOHNSON DEMANDED AN APOLOGY TO GRACE THEA SAID SHE WAS WILLING TO MAKE IT MISSUS JOHNSON SAID THAT HEREAFTER SINCE SHE HAD TAKEN LESSONS OF THE BEST PIANO TEACHER IN GRINNELL IOWA
8199-289915-0007 SHE HERSELF WOULD DECIDE WHAT PIECES GRACE SHOULD STUDY THEA READILY CONSENTED TO THAT AND MISSUS JOHNSON RUSTLED AWAY TO TELL A NEIGHBOR WOMAN THAT THEA KRONBORG COULD BE MEEK ENOUGH WHEN YOU WENT AT HER RIGHT
8199-289915-0008 THEA WAS TELLING RAY ABOUT THIS UNPLEASANT ENCOUNTER AS THEY WERE DRIVING OUT TO THE SAND HILLS THE NEXT SUNDAY SHE WAS STUFFING YOU ALL RIGHT THEE RAY REASSURED HER
8199-289915-0009 THERE'S NO GENERAL DISSATISFACTION AMONG YOUR SCHOLARS SHE JUST WANTED TO GET IN A KNOCK
8199-289915-0010 I TALKED TO THE PIANO TUNER THE LAST TIME HE WAS HERE AND HE SAID ALL THE PEOPLE HE TUNED FOR EXPRESSED THEMSELVES VERY FAVORABLY ABOUT YOUR TEACHING I WISH YOU DIDN'T TAKE SO MUCH PAINS WITH THEM MYSELF

8199-289915-0012 AND SHE HAS SUCH GOOD HANDS BUT SHE DON'T CARE A RAP ABOUT IT SHE HAS NO PRIDE RAY'S FACE WAS FULL OF COMPLACENT SATISFACTION AS HE GLANCED SIDEWISE AT THEA
8199-289915-0013 BUT SHE WAS LOOKING OFF INTENTLY INTO THE MIRAGE AT ONE OF THOSE MAMMOTH CATTLE THAT ARE NEARLY ALWAYS REFLECTED THERE DO YOU FIND IT EASIER TO TEACH IN YOUR NEW ROOM HE ASKED YES I'M NOT INTERRUPTED SO MUCH
8199-289915-0014 THAT'S ALWAYS THE NIGHT ANNA CHOOSES TO GO TO BED EARLY IT'S A DARNED SHAME THEE YOU DIDN'T COP THAT ROOM FOR YOURSELF I'M SORE AT THE PADRE ABOUT THAT HE OUGHT TO GIVE YOU THAT ROOM
8199-289915-0015 YOU COULD FIX IT UP SO PRETTY I DIDN'T WANT IT HONEST I DIDN'T FATHER WOULD HAVE LET ME HAVE IT I LIKE MY OWN ROOM BETTER SOMEHOW I CAN THINK BETTER IN A LITTLE ROOM

8199-289915-0017 THEA MOVED RESTLESSLY ON THE BUGGY CUSHIONS THEY NEED OTHER THINGS MORE SHE MUTTERED OH I FORGOT I BROUGHT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU LOOK HERE IT CAME ON MY BIRTHDAY
8199-289915-0018 WASN'T IT NICE OF HIM TO REMEMBER SHE TOOK FROM HER POCKET A POSTCARD BENT IN THE MIDDLE AND FOLDED AND HANDED IT TO RAY ON IT WAS A WHITE DOVE PERCHED ON A WREATH OF VERY BLUE FORGET ME NOTS

8199-289915-0031 ANY ONE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HEAR RAY'S SIMPLE AND CLEAR ACCOUNT OF THE PERFORMANCE HE HAD SEEN AT THE TABOR GRAND OPERA HOUSE MAGGIE MITCHELL IN LITTLE BAREFOOT
8199-289915-0032 AND ANY ONE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO WATCH HIS KIND FACE RAY LOOKED HIS BEST OUT OF DOORS WHEN HIS THICK RED HANDS WERE COVERED BY GLOVES
8199-289915-0033 AND THE DULL RED OF HIS SUNBURNED FACE SOMEHOW SEEMED RIGHT IN THE LIGHT AND WIND HE LOOKED BETTER TOO WITH HIS HAT ON HIS HAIR WAS THIN AND DRY WITH NO PARTICULAR COLOR OR CHARACTER
8199-289915-0034 REGULAR WILLY BOY HAIR AS HE HIMSELF DESCRIBED IT
8199-289915-0035 AND WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO TRAIN THEIR VISION UPON DISTANT OBJECTS RAY REALIZED THAT THEA'S LIFE WAS DULL AND EXACTING AND THAT SHE MISSED WUNSCH HE KNEW SHE WORKED HARD
8199-289915-0036 THAT SHE PUT UP WITH A GREAT MANY LITTLE ANNOYANCES AND THAT HER DUTIES AS A TEACHER SEPARATED HER MORE THAN EVER FROM THE BOYS AND GIRLS OF HER OWN AGE HE DID EVERYTHING HE COULD TO PROVIDE RECREATION FOR HER
8199-289915-0037 FROM DENVER AND KEPT HIS EYES AND EARS OPEN FOR ANYTHING THAT MIGHT INTEREST HER HE WAS OF COURSE LIVING FOR THEA HE HAD THOUGHT IT ALL OUT CAREFULLY AND HAD MADE UP HIS MIND
8199-289915-0038 JUST WHEN HE WOULD SPEAK TO HER WHEN SHE WAS SEVENTEEN THEN HE WOULD TELL HER HIS PLAN AND ASK HER TO MARRY HIM HE WOULD BE WILLING TO WAIT TWO OR EVEN THREE YEARS UNTIL SHE WAS TWENTY
8199-289915-0039 IF SHE THOUGHT BEST BY THAT TIME HE WOULD SURELY HAVE GOT IN ON SOMETHING COPPER OIL GOLD SILVER SHEEP SOMETHING
8199-289915-0040 MEANWHILE IT WAS PLEASURE ENOUGH TO FEEL THAT SHE DEPENDED ON HIM MORE AND MORE THAT SHE LEANED UPON HIS STEADY KINDNESS HE NEVER BROKE FAITH WITH HIMSELF ABOUT HER HE NEVER HINTED TO HER OF HIS HOPES FOR THE FUTURE
8199-289915-0041 NEVER SUGGESTED THAT SHE MIGHT BE MORE INTIMATELY CONFIDENTIAL WITH HIM OR TALKED TO HER OF THE THING HE THOUGHT ABOUT SO CONSTANTLY HE HAD THE CHIVALRY WHICH IS PERHAPS THE PROUDEST POSSESSION OF HIS RACE
8199-289915-0042 HE HAD NEVER EMBARRASSED HER BY SO MUCH AS A GLANCE SOMETIMES WHEN THEY DROVE OUT TO THE SAND HILLS HE LET HIS LEFT ARM LIE ALONG THE BACK OF THE BUGGY SEAT BUT IT NEVER CAME ANY NEARER TO THEA THAN THAT NEVER TOUCHED HER
8199-289915-0043 HE OFTEN TURNED TO HER A FACE FULL OF PRIDE AND FRANK ADMIRATION BUT HIS GLANCE WAS NEVER SO INTIMATE OR SO PENETRATING AS DOCTOR ARCHIE'S HIS BLUE EYES WERE CLEAR AND SHALLOW FRIENDLY
8199-289915-0044 UNINQUIRING HE RESTED THEA BECAUSE HE WAS SO DIFFERENT BECAUSE THOUGH HE OFTEN TOLD HER INTERESTING THINGS HE NEVER SET LIVELY FANCIES GOING IN HER HEAD BECAUSE HE NEVER MISUNDERSTOOD HER
