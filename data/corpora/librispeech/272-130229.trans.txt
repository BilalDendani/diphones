272-130229-0000 THREE MONTHS LATER THE KANGAROO STILL CONTINUES TO GROW WHICH IS VERY STRANGE AND PERPLEXING I NEVER KNEW ONE TO BE SO LONG GETTING ITS GROWTH IT HAS FUR ON ITS HEAD NOW NOT LIKE KANGAROO FUR BUT EXACTLY LIKE OUR HAIR
272-130229-0001 I AM LIKE TO LOSE MY MIND OVER THE CAPRICIOUS AND HARASSING DEVELOPMENTS OF THIS UNCLASSIFIABLE ZOOLOGICAL FREAK IF I COULD CATCH ANOTHER ONE BUT THAT IS HOPELESS IT IS A NEW VARIETY AND THE ONLY SAMPLE THIS IS PLAIN
272-130229-0002 BUT I CAUGHT A TRUE KANGAROO AND BROUGHT IT IN THINKING THAT THIS ONE BEING LONESOME WOULD RATHER HAVE THAT FOR COMPANY THAN HAVE NO KIN AT ALL
272-130229-0003 AMONG FRIENDS BUT IT WAS A MISTAKE
272-130229-0004 I PITY THE POOR NOISY LITTLE ANIMAL BUT THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO TO MAKE IT HAPPY IF I COULD TAME IT BUT THAT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION THE MORE I TRY THE WORSE I SEEM TO MAKE IT IT GRIEVES ME TO THE HEART TO SEE IT IN ITS LITTLE STORMS OF SORROW AND PASSION
272-130229-0005 I WANTED TO LET IT GO BUT SHE WOULDN'T HEAR OF IT THAT SEEMED CRUEL AND NOT LIKE HER AND YET SHE MAY BE RIGHT IT MIGHT BE LONELIER THAN EVER FOR SINCE I CANNOT FIND ANOTHER ONE HOW COULD IT FIVE MONTHS LATER
272-130229-0006 IT IS NOT A KANGAROO NO FOR IT SUPPORTS ITSELF BY HOLDING TO HER FINGER AND THUS GOES A FEW STEPS ON ITS HIND LEGS AND THEN FALLS DOWN IT IS PROBABLY SOME KIND OF A BEAR AND YET IT HAS NO TAIL AS YET AND NO FUR EXCEPT ON ITS HEAD
272-130229-0007 FOR BEARS GET THEIR GROWTH EARLIER THAN THIS BEARS ARE DANGEROUS SINCE OUR CATASTROPHE
272-130229-0008 SHE IS DETERMINED TO RUN US INTO ALL SORTS OF FOOLISH RISKS I THINK SHE WAS NOT LIKE THIS BEFORE SHE LOST HER MIND A FORTNIGHT LATER I EXAMINED ITS MOUTH THERE IS NO DANGER YET
272-130229-0009 IT HAS ONLY ONE TOOTH IT HAS NO TAIL YET IT MAKES MORE NOISE NOW THAN IT EVER DID BEFORE AND MAINLY AT NIGHT I HAVE MOVED OUT
272-130229-0010 FOR A BEAR DOES NOT NEED A TAIL IN ORDER TO BE DANGEROUS FOUR MONTHS LATER
272-130229-0011 IN THE MEAN TIME WITHOUT STIRRING FROM THE HOME ESTATE SHE HAS CAUGHT ANOTHER ONE I NEVER SAW SUCH LUCK
272-130229-0012 NEXT DAY
272-130229-0013 SO I HAVE RELINQUISHED THE IDEA THOUGH I THINK IT IS A MISTAKE IT WOULD BE AN IRREPARABLE LOSS TO SCIENCE IF THEY SHOULD GET AWAY THE OLD ONE IS TAMER THAN IT WAS AND CAN LAUGH AND TALK LIKE THE PARROT HAVING LEARNED THIS NO DOUBT FROM BEING WITH THE PARROT SO MUCH
272-130229-0014 AND HAVING THE IMITATIVE FACULTY IN A HIGHLY DEVELOPED DEGREE I SHALL BE ASTONISHED IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE A NEW KIND OF PARROT
272-130229-0015 SINCE THOSE FIRST DAYS WHEN IT WAS A FISH THE NEW ONE IS AS UGLY NOW AS THE OLD ONE WAS AT FIRST HAS THE SAME SULPHUR AND RAW MEAT COMPLEXION AND THE SAME SINGULAR HEAD WITHOUT ANY FUR ON IT SHE CALLS IT ABEL
272-130229-0016 TEN YEARS LATER THEY ARE BOYS WE FOUND IT OUT LONG AGO
272-130229-0017 AFTER ALL THESE YEARS I SEE THAT I WAS MISTAKEN ABOUT EVE IN THE BEGINNING IT IS BETTER TO LIVE OUTSIDE THE GARDEN WITH HER THAN INSIDE IT WITHOUT HER AT FIRST I THOUGHT SHE TALKED TOO MUCH BUT NOW
272-130229-0018 I SHOULD BE SORRY TO HAVE THAT VOICE FALL SILENT AND PASS OUT OF MY LIFE BLESSED BE THE CHESTNUT THAT BROUGHT US NEAR TOGETHER AND TAUGHT ME TO KNOW THE GOODNESS OF HER HEART
