1107-1042-0000 GERTRUDE WAS LOCKED IN HER ROOM WITH A HEADACHE AND I HAD LUNCHEON ALONE MISTER HARTON THE LAWYER WAS A LITTLE THIN MAN AND HE LOOKED AS IF HE DID NOT RELISH HIS BUSINESS THAT DAY THIS IS VERY UNFORTUNATE MISS INNES HE SAID
1107-1042-0001 NO DOUBT I SAID ABSENTLY MISTER HARTON I AM GOING TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS AND I HOPE YOU WILL ANSWER THEM
1107-1042-0002 BECAUSE I AND MY FAMILY ARE JUST NOW IN A MOST AMBIGUOUS POSITION I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE UNDERSTOOD ME OR NOT HE TOOK OF HIS GLASSES AND WIPED THEM
1107-1042-0003 FOR TWO YEARS HE HAD LIVED IN TOWN
1107-1042-0004 TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK MISS INNES
1107-1042-0005 HE HAD BEEN STAYING AT THE CLUB HOUSE ACROSS THE VALLEY FOR THE LAST WEEK JARVIS TELLS ME BUT THAT ONLY EXPLAINS HOW HE CAME HERE NOT WHY IT IS A MOST UNFORTUNATE FAMILY HE SHOOK HIS HEAD DESPONDENTLY
1107-1042-0006 AND I FELT THAT THIS DRIED UP LITTLE MAN WAS THE REPOSITORY OF MUCH THAT HE HAD NOT TOLD ME
1107-1042-0007 A SOFT HAT LAY BESIDE IT AND THE COLLAR OF THE DINNER COAT WAS STILL TURNED UP THE HANDSOME DISSIPATED FACE OF ARNOLD ARMSTRONG PURGED OF ITS UGLY LINES WAS NOW ONLY PATHETIC AS WE WENT IN MISSUS WATSON APPEARED AT THE CARD ROOM DOOR
1107-1042-0008 COME IN MISSUS WATSON THE LAWYER SAID BUT SHE SHOOK HER HEAD AND WITHDREW SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE HOUSE WHO SEEMED TO REGRET THE DEAD MAN
1107-1042-0009 IF I COULD ONLY HAVE SEEN HALSEY COMING AT HIS USUAL HARE BRAINED CLIP UP THE DRIVE IF I COULD HAVE HEARD THE THROB OF THE MOTOR I WOULD HAVE FELT THAT MY TROUBLES WERE OVER BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN THE COUNTRYSIDE LAY SUNNY AND QUIET
1107-1042-0010 IN ITS PEACEFUL SUNDAY AFTERNOON CALM AND FAR DOWN THE DRIVE MISTER JAMIESON WAS WALKING SLOWLY STOOPING NOW AND THEN AS IF TO EXAMINE THE ROAD WHEN I WENT BACK MISTER HARTON WAS FURTIVELY WIPING HIS EYES
1107-1042-0011 THE SECOND MISSUS ARMSTRONG HAD BEEN A WIDOW WITH A CHILD A LITTLE GIRL THIS CHILD NOW PERHAPS TWENTY WAS LOUISE ARMSTRONG HAVING TAKEN HER STEPFATHER'S NAME AND WAS AT PRESENT IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE FAMILY
1107-1042-0012 SAD PART OF MY ERRAND HERE TO DAY IS TO SEE IF YOU WILL RELINQUISH YOUR LEASE HERE IN THEIR FAVOR WE WOULD BETTER WAIT AND SEE IF THEY WISH TO COME I SAID IT SEEMS UNLIKELY AND MY TOWN HOUSE IS BEING REMODELED AT THAT HE LET THE MATTER DROP
1107-1042-0013 BUT IT CAME UP UNPLEASANTLY ENOUGH LATER AT SIX O'CLOCK THE BODY WAS TAKEN AWAY AND AT SEVEN THIRTY AFTER AN EARLY DINNER MISTER HARTON WENT
1107-1042-0014 SIT DOWN I SAID GRIMLY HAVE YOU FOUND A CLUE THAT WILL INCRIMINATE ME MISTER JAMIESON HE HAD THE GRACE TO LOOK UNCOMFORTABLE NO HE SAID IF YOU HAD KILLED MISTER ARMSTRONG YOU WOULD HAVE LEFT NO CLUES
1107-1042-0015 YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TOO MUCH INTELLIGENCE
1107-1042-0016 I HAVE BEEN TO THE CLUB HOUSE HE SAID AND AMONG MISTER ARMSTRONG'S EFFECTS I FOUND THESE ONE IS CURIOUS THE OTHER IS PUZZLING THE FIRST WAS A SHEET OF CLUB NOTE PAPER ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN OVER AND OVER THE NAME HALSEY B INNES
1107-1042-0017 IT WAS HALSEY'S FLOWING SIGNATURE TO A DOT BUT IT LACKED HALSEY'S EASE THE ONES TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE SHEET WERE MUCH BETTER THAN THE TOP ONES MISTER JAMIESON SMILED AT MY FACE HIS OLD TRICKS HE SAID
1107-1042-0018 THAT ONE IS MERELY CURIOUS THIS ONE AS I SAID BEFORE IS PUZZLING
1107-1042-0019 IN ONE OF THE ROOMS CHIMNEY THAT WAS ALL WELL I SAID LOOKING UP THERE IS NOTHING IN THAT IS THERE
1107-1042-0020 BECOMING AN OBJECT OF SUSPICION THERE IS LITTLE IN THE PAPER ITSELF HE ADMITTED
1107-1042-0021 HE NEVER BUILT A HOUSE YOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT IF IT IS THIS HOUSE IT MAY MEAN ANYTHING FROM A SECRET ROOM TO AN EXTRA BATH ROOM I SAID SCORNFULLY HAVEN'T YOU A THUMB PRINT TOO I HAVE HE SAID WITH A SMILE
1107-1042-0022 AND THE PRINT OF A FOOT IN A TULIP BED AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THE ODDEST PART IS MISS INNES THAT THE THUMB MARK IS PROBABLY YOURS AND THE FOOTPRINT CERTAINLY HIS AUDACITY WAS THE ONLY THING THAT SAVED ME HIS AMUSED SMILE PUT ME ON MY METTLE
1107-1042-0023 AND I RIPPED OUT A PERFECTLY GOOD SCALLOP BEFORE I ANSWERED WHY DID I STEP INTO THE TULIP BED I ASKED WITH INTEREST YOU PICKED UP SOMETHING HE SAID GOOD HUMOREDLY WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO TELL ME ABOUT LATER
1107-1042-0024 WITH THIS REMARKABLE INSIGHT OF YOURS I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME
1107-1042-0025 I AM GOING TO TELL YOU THAT WHEN YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU PICKED UP IN THE TULIP BED
1107-1042-0026 WE WERE ONLY MEASURING WEAPONS THEN HE SMILED A LITTLE AND GOT UP
1107-1042-0027 YOU MIGHT THINK OVER MY OFFER IN THE MEANTIME HE WENT ON THROUGH THE DRAWING ROOM AND I LISTENED TO HIS FOOTSTEPS GROWING GRADUALLY FAINTER I DROPPED MY PRETENSE AT KNITTING AND LEANING BACK I THOUGHT OVER THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS
1107-1042-0028 HERE WAS I RACHEL INNES SPINSTER A GRANDDAUGHTER OF OLD JOHN INNES OF REVOLUTIONARY DAYS A D A R A COLONIAL DAME MIXED UP WITH A VULGAR AND REVOLTING CRIME AND EVEN ATTEMPTING TO HOODWINK THE LAW
1107-1042-0029 CERTAINLY I HAD LEFT THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW WAY I WAS ROUSED BY HEARING MISTER JAMIESON COMING RAPIDLY BACK THROUGH THE DRAWING ROOM HE STOPPED AT THE DOOR MISS INNES HE SAID QUICKLY WILL YOU COME WITH ME AND LIGHT THE EAST CORRIDOR
1107-1042-0030 I SPOKE INSTEAD OF AN ANSWER WHOEVER IT WAS TURNED AND RAN UP I FOLLOWED IT WAS DARK BUT AS I TURNED THE CORNER AT THE TOP A FIGURE DARTED THROUGH THIS DOOR AND CLOSED IT
1107-1042-0031 WE WERE IN THE UPPER HALL NOW
1107-1042-0032 YOU WOULD BETTER WAIT IN YOUR OWN ROOM TREMBLING AS I WAS I WAS DETERMINED TO SEE THAT DOOR OPENED I HARDLY KNEW WHAT I FEARED BUT SO MANY TERRIBLE AND INEXPLICABLE THINGS HAD HAPPENED THAT SUSPENSE WAS WORSE THAN CERTAINTY
1107-1042-0033 I AM PERFECTLY COOL I SAID AND I AM GOING TO REMAIN HERE THE LIGHTS FLASHED UP ALONG
1107-1042-0034 THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE WOUND ITS WAY UP AS IF IT HAD BEEN AN AFTERTHOUGHT OF THE ARCHITECT AND JUST AROUND THE CORNER
1107-1042-0035 WAS THE DOOR MISTER JAMIESON HAD INDICATED I WAS STILL UNFAMILIAR WITH THE HOUSE AND I DID NOT REMEMBER THE DOOR MY HEART WAS THUMPING WILDLY IN MY EARS BUT I NODDED TO HIM TO GO AHEAD I WAS PERHAPS EIGHT OR TEN FEET AWAY
1107-1042-0036 AND THEN HE THREW THE BOLT BACK COME OUT
1107-1042-0037 THEN I THINK HE HAD A REVOLVER BUT I AM NOT SURE HE STEPPED ASIDE AND THREW THE DOOR OPEN FROM WHERE I STOOD I COULD NOT SEE BEYOND THE DOOR BUT I SAW MISTER JAMIESON'S FACE CHANGE AND HEARD HIM MUTTER SOMETHING THEN HE BOLTED DOWN THE STAIRS THREE AT A TIME
1107-1042-0038 IT SEEMED AT FIRST TO BE A CLOSET EMPTY
1107-1042-0039 TO STOP WITH A SHUDDER WHERE THE FLOOR SHOULD HAVE BEEN WAS BLACK VOID AND DARKNESS FROM WHICH CAME THE INDESCRIBABLE DAMP SMELL OF THE CELLARS
