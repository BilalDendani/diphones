5077-38105-0000 WHAT A DISHEARTENING CONTRAST DID CECILIA'S HAPPY LIFE PRESENT TO THE LIFE OF HER FRIEND WHO IN EMILY'S POSITION COULD HAVE READ THAT JOYOUSLY WRITTEN LETTER FROM SWITZERLAND AND NOT HAVE LOST HEART AND FAITH FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST
5077-38105-0001 AS THE INEVITABLE RESULT A BUOYANT TEMPERAMENT IS OF ALL MORAL QUALITIES THE MOST PRECIOUS IN THIS RESPECT IT IS THE ONE FORCE IN US WHEN VIRTUOUS RESOLUTION PROVES INSUFFICIENT
5077-38105-0002 WHICH RESISTS BY INSTINCT THE STEALTHY APPROACHES OF DESPAIR I SHALL ONLY CRY EMILY THOUGHT IF I STAY AT HOME BETTER GO OUT OBSERVANT PERSONS
5077-38105-0003 ACCUSTOMED TO FREQUENT THE LONDON PARKS CAN HARDLY HAVE FAILED TO NOTICE THE NUMBER OF SOLITARY STRANGERS SADLY ENDEAVORING TO VARY THEIR LIVES BY TAKING A WALK THEY LINGER ABOUT THE FLOWER BEDS
5077-38105-0004 THEY SIT FOR HOURS ON THE BENCHES THEY LOOK WITH PATIENT CURIOSITY AT OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMPANIONS THEY NOTICE LADIES ON HORSEBACK AND CHILDREN AT PLAY WITH SUBMISSIVE INTEREST SOME OF THE MEN
5077-38105-0005 FIND COMPANY IN A PIPE WITHOUT APPEARING TO ENJOY IT SOME OF THE WOMEN FIND A SUBSTITUTE FOR DINNER IN LITTLE DRY BISCUITS WRAPPED IN CRUMPLED SCRAPS OF PAPER THEY ARE NOT SOCIABLE
5077-38105-0006 PERHAPS THEY ARE SHAME FACED OR PROUD OR SULLEN PERHAPS THEY DESPAIR OF OTHERS BEING ACCUSTOMED TO DESPAIR OF THEMSELVES PERHAPS THEY HAVE THEIR REASONS
5077-38105-0007 FOR NEVER VENTURING TO ENCOUNTER CURIOSITY OR THEIR VICES WHICH DREAD DETECTION OR THEIR VIRTUES WHICH SUFFER HARDSHIP WITH THE RESIGNATION THAT IS SUFFICIENT FOR ITSELF THE ONE THING CERTAIN IS
5077-38105-0008 THAT THESE UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE RESIST DISCOVERY WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE STRANGERS IN LONDON AND WE KNOW NO MORE AND EMILY WAS ONE OF THEM AMONG THE OTHER FORLORN WANDERERS IN THE PARKS
5077-38105-0009 THERE APPEARED LATTERLY A TRIM LITTLE FIGURE IN BLACK WITH THE FACE PROTECTED FROM NOTICE BEHIND A CRAPE VEIL WHICH WAS BEGINNING TO BE FAMILIAR DAY AFTER DAY TO NURSEMAIDS AND CHILDREN
5077-38105-0010 AND TO ROUSE CURIOSITY AMONG HARMLESS SOLITARIES MEDITATING ON BENCHES AND IDLE VAGABONDS STROLLING OVER THE GRASS THE WOMAN SERVANT WHOM THE CONSIDERATE DOCTOR HAD PROVIDED
5077-38105-0011 MISSUS ELLMOTHER HAD NEVER SHOWN HERSELF AGAIN SINCE THE FUNERAL MISSUS MOSEY COULD NOT FORGET THAT SHE HAD BEEN NO MATTER HOW POLITELY REQUESTED TO WITHDRAW TO WHOM COULD EMILY SAY
5077-38105-0012 LET US GO OUT FOR A WALK SHE HAD COMMUNICATED THE NEWS OF HER AUNT'S DEATH TO MISS LADD AT BRIGHTON AND HAD HEARD FROM FRANCINE THE WORTHY SCHOOLMISTRESS HAD WRITTEN TO HER WITH THE TRUEST KINDNESS
5077-38105-0013 CHOOSE YOUR OWN TIME MY POOR CHILD AND COME AND STAY WITH ME AT BRIGHTON THE SOONER THE BETTER EMILY SHRANK
5077-38105-0014 BUT FROM ENCOUNTERING FRANCINE THE HARD WEST INDIAN HEIRESS LOOKED HARDER THAN EVER WITH A PEN IN HER HAND HER LETTER ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WAS GETTING ON WRETCHEDLY WITH HER STUDIES WHICH SHE HATED
5077-38105-0015 SHE FOUND THE MASTERS APPOINTED TO INSTRUCT HER UGLY AND DISAGREEABLE AND LOATHED THE SIGHT OF THEM SHE HAD TAKEN A DISLIKE TO MISS LADD AND TIME ONLY CONFIRMED THAT UNFAVORABLE IMPRESSION
5077-38105-0016 BRIGHTON WAS ALWAYS THE SAME THE SEA WAS ALWAYS THE SAME THE DRIVES WERE ALWAYS THE SAME FRANCINE FELT A PRESENTIMENT THAT SHE SHOULD DO SOMETHING DESPERATE UNLESS EMILY JOINED HER AND MADE BRIGHTON ENDURABLE
5077-38105-0017 BEHIND THE HORRID SCHOOLMISTRESS'S BACK SOLITUDE IN LONDON WAS A PRIVILEGE AND A PLEASURE VIEWED AS THE ALTERNATIVE TO SUCH COMPANIONSHIP AS THIS EMILY WROTE GRATEFULLY TO MISS LADD
5077-38105-0018 OTHER DAYS HAD PASSED DREARILY SINCE THAT TIME BUT THE ONE DAY THAT HAD BROUGHT WITH IT CECILIA'S LETTER SET PAST HAPPINESS AND PRESENT SORROW TOGETHER
5077-38105-0019 THAT EMILY'S COURAGE SANK SHE HAD FORCED BACK THE TEARS IN HER LONELY HOME SHE HAD GONE OUT TO SEEK CONSOLATION AND ENCOURAGEMENT UNDER THE SUNNY SKY
5077-38105-0020 TO FIND COMFORT FOR HER SORE HEART IN THE RADIANT SUMMER BEAUTY OF FLOWERS AND GRASS IN THE SWEET BREATHING OF THE AIR
5077-38105-0021 NO MOTHER NATURE IS STEPMOTHER TO THE SICK AT HEART SOON TOO SOON SHE COULD HARDLY SEE WHERE SHE WENT AGAIN AND AGAIN SHE RESOLUTELY CLEARED HER EYES UNDER THE SHELTER OF HER VEIL
5077-38105-0022 WHEN PASSING STRANGERS NOTICED HER AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THE TEARS FOUND THEIR WAY BACK OH IF THE GIRLS AT THE SCHOOL WERE TO SEE HER NOW THE GIRLS WHO USED TO SAY IN THEIR MOMENTS OF SADNESS
5077-38105-0023 LET US GO TO EMILY AND BE CHEERED WOULD THEY KNOW HER AGAIN SHE SAT DOWN TO REST AND RECOVER HERSELF ON THE NEAREST BENCH IT WAS UNOCCUPIED NO PASSING FOOTSTEPS WERE AUDIBLE ON THE REMOTE PATH
5077-38105-0024 TO WHICH SHE HAD STRAYED SOLITUDE AT HOME SOLITUDE IN THE PARK
5077-38105-0025 HAPPY IN THE COMPANY OF HER LIGHT HEARTED FRIEND THE LONELY INTERVAL PASSED AND PERSONS CAME NEAR TWO SISTERS GIRLS LIKE HERSELF STOPPED TO REST ON THE BENCH
5077-38105-0026 THEY WERE FULL OF THEIR OWN INTERESTS
5077-38105-0027 AND THE ELDER WAS TO BE BRIDESMAID THEY TALKED OF THEIR DRESSES AND THEIR PRESENTS THEY COMPARED THE DASHING BRIDEGROOM OF ONE WITH THE TIMID LOVER OF THE OTHER
5077-38105-0028 OVER THEIR JOYOUS DREAMS OF THE FUTURE
5077-38105-0029 TOO JOYFULLY RESTLESS TO REMAIN INACTIVE ANY LONGER THEY JUMPED UP AGAIN FROM THE SEAT ONE OF THEM SAID POLLY I'M TOO HAPPY AND DANCED AS SHE WALKED AWAY THE OTHER CRIED SALLY FOR SHAME
5077-38105-0030 AND LAUGHED AS IF SHE HAD HIT ON THE MOST IRRESISTIBLE JOKE THAT EVER WAS MADE EMILY ROSE AND WENT HOME BY SOME MYSTERIOUS INFLUENCE WHICH SHE WAS UNABLE TO TRACE
5077-38105-0031 THE BOISTEROUS MERRIMENT OF THE TWO GIRLS HAD ROUSED IN HER A SENSE OF REVOLT AGAINST THE LIFE THAT SHE WAS LEADING CHANGE SPEEDY CHANGE TO SOME OCCUPATION THAT WOULD FORCE HER TO EXERT HERSELF
5077-38105-0032 PRESENTED THE ONE PROMISE OF BRIGHTER DAYS THAT SHE COULD SEE TO FEEL THIS WAS TO BE INEVITABLY REMINDED OF SIR JERVIS REDWOOD HERE WAS A MAN WHO HAD NEVER SEEN HER
5077-38105-0033 TRANSFORMED BY THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE OPERATION OF CHANCE INTO THE FRIEND OF WHOM SHE STOOD IN NEED THE FRIEND WHO POINTED THE WAY TO A NEW WORLD OF ACTION THE BUSY WORLD OF READERS IN THE LIBRARY OF THE MUSEUM
5077-38105-0034 EARLY IN THE NEW WEEK EMILY HAD ACCEPTED SIR JERVIS'S PROPOSAL AND HAD SO INTERESTED THE BOOKSELLER TO WHOM SHE HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO APPLY THAT HE TOOK IT ON HIMSELF
5077-38105-0035 TO MODIFY THE ARBITRARY INSTRUCTIONS OF HIS EMPLOYER THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAS NO MERCY ON HIMSELF AND NO MERCY ON OTHERS HE EXPLAINED WHERE HIS LITERARY LABORS ARE CONCERNED
5077-38105-0036 YOU MUST SPARE YOURSELF MISS EMILY IT IS NOT ONLY ABSURD IT'S CRUEL TO EXPECT YOU TO RANSACK OLD NEWSPAPERS FOR DISCOVERIES IN YUCATAN
5077-38105-0037 FROM THE TIME WHEN STEPHENS PUBLISHED HIS TRAVELS IN CENTRAL AMERICA' NEARLY FORTY YEARS SINCE BEGIN WITH BACK NUMBERS PUBLISHED WITHIN A FEW YEARS
5077-38105-0038 FIVE YEARS FROM THE PRESENT DATE AND LET US SEE WHAT YOUR SEARCH OVER THAT INTERVAL WILL BRING FORTH ACCEPTING THIS FRIENDLY ADVICE EMILY BEGAN WITH THE NEWSPAPER VOLUME DATING FROM NEW YEAR'S DAY
5077-38105-0039 EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX THE FIRST HOUR OF HER SEARCH STRENGTHENED THE SINCERE SENSE OF GRATITUDE WITH WHICH SHE REMEMBERED THE BOOKSELLER'S KINDNESS TO KEEP HER ATTENTION STEADILY FIXED
5077-38105-0040 ON THE ONE SUBJECT THAT INTERESTED HER EMPLOYER AND TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO READ THOSE MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS OF NEWS WHICH ESPECIALLY INTEREST WOMEN PUT HER PATIENCE AND RESOLUTION TO A MERCILESS TEST
5077-38105-0041 HAPPILY FOR HERSELF HER NEIGHBORS ON EITHER SIDE WERE NO IDLERS TO SEE THEM SO ABSORBED OVER THEIR WORK
5077-38105-0042 WAS TO FIND EXACTLY THE EXAMPLE OF WHICH SHE STOOD MOST IN NEED AS THE HOURS WORE ON SHE PURSUED HER WEARY WAY DOWN ONE COLUMN AND UP ANOTHER RESIGNED AT LEAST IF NOT QUITE RECONCILED YET
5077-38105-0043 TO HER TASK HER LABORS ENDED FOR THE DAY WITH SUCH ENCOURAGEMENT AS SHE MIGHT DERIVE FROM THE CONVICTION OF HAVING THUS FAR HONESTLY PURSUED A USELESS SEARCH NEWS WAS WAITING FOR HER WHEN SHE REACHED HOME
5077-38105-0044 WHICH RAISED HER SINKING SPIRITS ON LEAVING THE COTTAGE THAT MORNING SHE HAD GIVEN CERTAIN INSTRUCTIONS RELATING TO THE MODEST STRANGER WHO HAD TAKEN CHARGE OF HER CORRESPONDENCE IN CASE OF HIS PAYING A SECOND VISIT
5077-38105-0045 DURING HER ABSENCE AT THE MUSEUM THE FIRST WORDS SPOKEN BY THE SERVANT ON OPENING THE DOOR INFORMED HER THAT THE UNKNOWN GENTLEMAN HAD CALLED AGAIN THIS TIME HE HAD BOLDLY LEFT HIS CARD
5077-38105-0046 THERE WAS THE WELCOME NAME THAT SHE HAD EXPECTED TO SEE
