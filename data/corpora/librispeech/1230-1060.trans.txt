1230-1060-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR FLINDERS IF HALSEY HAD ONLY TAKEN ME FULLY INTO HIS CONFIDENCE THROUGH THE WHOLE AFFAIR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH SIMPLER IF HE HAD BEEN ALTOGETHER FRANK ABOUT JACK BAILEY
1230-1060-0001 THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO HARROWING PERIOD FOR ALL OF US WITH THE BOY IN DANGER BUT YOUNG PEOPLE REFUSE TO PROFIT BY THE EXPERIENCE OF THEIR ELDERS AND SOMETIMES THE ELDERS ARE THE ONES TO SUFFER
1230-1060-0002 I WAS MUCH USED UP THE DAY AFTER THE FIRE AND GERTRUDE INSISTED ON MY GOING OUT THE MACHINE WAS TEMPORARILY OUT OF COMMISSION AND THE CARRIAGE HORSES HAD BEEN SENT TO A FARM FOR THE SUMMER
1230-1060-0003 GERTRUDE FINALLY GOT A TRAP FROM THE CASANOVA LIVERYMAN AND WE WENT OUT JUST AS WE TURNED FROM THE DRIVE INTO THE ROAD WE PASSED A WOMAN
1230-1060-0004 SHE HAD PUT DOWN A SMALL VALISE AND STOOD INSPECTING THE HOUSE AND GROUNDS MINUTELY I SHOULD HARDLY HAVE NOTICED HER HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE FACT
1230-1060-0005 I SHALL DREAM OF IT TO NIGHT GET UP FLINDERS
1230-1060-0006 IT IS SHE FLICKED THE HORSE'S STUBBY MANE WITH THE WHIP HE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE A LIVERY HORSE AND THE LIVERYMAN SAID HE HAD BOUGHT HIM FROM THE ARMSTRONGS WHEN THEY PURCHASED A COUPLE OF MOTORS AND CUT DOWN THE STABLE NICE FLINDERS GOOD OLD BOY
1230-1060-0007 FLINDERS WAS CERTAINLY NOT A COMMON NAME FOR A HORSE AND YET THE YOUNGSTER AT RICHFIELD
1230-1060-0008 PRANCING CURLY HAIRED LITTLE HORSE FLINDERS
1230-1060-0009 AND SOMEWHAT GUARDEDLY HAD TOLD HIM OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT'S EVENTS MISTER JAMIESON PROMISED TO COME OUT THAT NIGHT AND TO BRING ANOTHER MAN WITH HIM I DID NOT CONSIDER IT NECESSARY TO NOTIFY MISSUS ARMSTRONG IN THE VILLAGE NO DOUBT SHE KNEW OF THE FIRE
1230-1060-0010 AND IN VIEW OF MY REFUSAL TO GIVE UP THE HOUSE
1230-1060-0011 BUT AS WE PASSED DOCTOR WALKER'S WHITE AND GREEN HOUSE I THOUGHT OF SOMETHING STOP HERE GERTRUDE I SAID
1230-1060-0012 TO SEE LOUISE SHE ASKED NO I WANT TO ASK THIS YOUNG WALKER SOMETHING SHE WAS CURIOUS I KNEW
1230-1060-0013 I WENT UP THE WALK TO THE HOUSE WHERE A BRASS SIGN AT THE SIDE ANNOUNCED THE OFFICE AND WENT IN THE RECEPTION ROOM WAS EMPTY BUT FROM THE CONSULTING ROOM BEYOND CAME THE SOUND OF TWO VOICES NOT VERY AMICABLE
1230-1060-0014 THE VOICES CEASED AT ONCE A DOOR CLOSED SOMEWHERE AND THE DOCTOR ENTERED FROM THE HALL OF THE HOUSE HE LOOKED SUFFICIENTLY SURPRISED AT SEEING ME GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR I SAID FORMALLY
1230-1060-0015 I SHALL NOT KEEP YOU FROM YOUR PATIENT I WISH MERELY TO ASK YOU A QUESTION WON'T YOU SIT DOWN IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY DOCTOR
1230-1060-0016 A BULLET WOUND THINGS MUST BE LIVELY AT SUNNYSIDE
1230-1060-0017 BUT AS IT HAPPENS IT WAS IF ANY SUCH CASE COMES TO YOU WILL IT BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE FOR YOU TO LET ME KNOW
1230-1060-0018 UNTIL I AM BURNED OUT I RESPONDED AND THEN ON MY WAY DOWN THE STEPS I TURNED AROUND SUDDENLY DOCTOR I ASKED AT A VENTURE HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A CHILD NAMED LUCIEN WALLACE
1230-1060-0019 HIS FACE CHANGED AND STIFFENED HE WAS ON HIS GUARD AGAIN IN A MOMENT
1230-1060-0020 THERE ARE PLENTY OF WALLACES AROUND BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY LUCIEN I WAS AS CERTAIN AS POSSIBLE THAT HE DID PEOPLE DO NOT LIE READILY TO ME AND THIS MAN LIED BEYOND A DOUBT
1230-1060-0021 BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE GAINED NOW HIS DEFENSES WERE UP AND I LEFT HALF IRRITATED AND WHOLLY BAFFLED
1230-1060-0022 GERTRUDE AND I DRANK SOME HOME MADE ELDERBERRY WINE AND TOLD BRIEFLY OF THE FIRE OF THE MORE SERIOUS PART OF THE NIGHT'S EXPERIENCE OF COURSE WE SAID NOTHING
1230-1060-0023 SHOT HE SAID BLESS MY SOUL NO
1230-1060-0024 SOME ONE TRIED TO ENTER THE HOUSE DURING THE FIRE AND WAS SHOT AND SLIGHTLY INJURED I SAID HASTILY PLEASE DON'T MENTION IT WE WISH TO MAKE AS LITTLE OF IT AS POSSIBLE
1230-1060-0025 AND WE TRIED THAT AT CASANOVA STATION
1230-1060-0026 BETWEEN ONE O'CLOCK AND DAYLIGHT THERE WAS NONE UNTIL SIX A M THE NEXT QUESTION REQUIRED MORE DIPLOMACY DID YOU NOTICE ON THE SIX O'CLOCK TRAIN ANY PERSON
1230-1060-0027 I WAS UP THERE MYSELF AT THE FIRE HE SAID VOLUBLY I'M A MEMBER OF THE VOLUNTEER COMPANY
1230-1060-0028 RANG THAT BELL SO HARD I HADN'T TIME SCARCELY TO GET EM ON AND DID YOU SEE A MAN WHO LIMPED GERTRUDE PUT IN AS HE STOPPED FOR BREATH
1230-1060-0029 I SEEN THERE WASN'T MUCH MORE TO DO ANYHOW AT THE FIRE WE'D GOT THE FLAMES UNDER CONTROL GERTRUDE LOOKED AT ME AND SMILED SO I STARTED DOWN THE HILL
1230-1060-0030 ONE WAS A SHORT FELLOW
1230-1060-0031 HE WAS SWEARING SOMETHING SICKENING DID THEY GO TOWARD THE CLUB GERTRUDE ASKED SUDDENLY LEANING FORWARD NO MISS I THINK THEY CAME INTO THE VILLAGE
1230-1060-0032 I DIDN'T GET A LOOK AT THEIR FACES BUT I KNOW EVERY CHICK AND CHILD IN THE PLACE AND EVERYBODY KNOWS ME WHEN THEY DIDN'T SHOUT AT ME IN MY UNIFORM YOU KNOW
1230-1060-0033 SOME ONE HAD BEEN SHOT BY THE BULLET THAT WENT THROUGH THE DOOR HE HAD NOT LEFT THE VILLAGE AND HE HAD NOT CALLED IN A PHYSICIAN ALSO
1230-1060-0034 AND I THINK EVEN GERTRUDE WAS GLAD OF IT DRIVING HOME THAT AFTERNOON
1230-1060-0035 GERTRUDE I SAID
1230-1060-0036 YOU ARE GOING TO LEAVE THIS MISERABLE HOUSE TO NIGHT ANNIE MORTON IS GOING TO SCOTLAND NEXT WEEK AND YOU SHALL GO RIGHT WITH HER TO MY SURPRISE SHE FLUSHED PAINFULLY I DON'T WANT TO GO AUNT RAY SHE SAID
1230-1060-0037 DON'T MAKE ME LEAVE NOW YOU ARE LOSING YOUR HEALTH AND YOUR GOOD LOOKS I SAID DECIDEDLY YOU SHOULD HAVE A CHANGE I SHAN'T STIR A FOOT SHE WAS EQUALLY DECIDED
1230-1060-0038 THEN MORE LIGHTLY WHY YOU AND LIDDY NEED ME TO ARBITRATE BETWEEN YOU EVERY DAY IN THE WEEK PERHAPS I WAS GROWING SUSPICIOUS OF EVERY ONE
1230-1060-0039 I WATCHED HER COVERTLY DURING THE REST OF THE DRIVE
