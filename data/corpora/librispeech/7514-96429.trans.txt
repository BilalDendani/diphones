7514-96429-0000 WISHING TO BE SATISFIED WHAT DEGREE OF TRUTH THERE WAS IN A STORY WHICH A FRIEND OF JOHNSON'S AND MINE HAD TOLD ME TO HIS DISADVANTAGE
7514-96429-0001 WAS ONE DAY WHEN JOHNSON WAS AT DINNER WITH HIM SEIZED FOR DEBT AND CARRIED TO PRISON
7514-96429-0002 UPON WHICH THE GENTLEMAN'S SISTER WHO WAS PRESENT COULD NOT SUPPRESS HER INDIGNATION WHAT SIR SAID SHE ARE YOU SO UNFEELING AS NOT EVEN TO OFFER TO GO TO MY BROTHER IN HIS DISTRESS
7514-96429-0003 YOU WHO HAVE BEEN SO MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM AND THAT JOHNSON ANSWERED MADAM I OWE HIM NO OBLIGATION WHAT HE DID FOR ME HE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR A DOG
7514-96429-0004 JOHNSON ASSURED ME THAT THE STORY WAS ABSOLUTELY FALSE BUT LIKE A MAN CONSCIOUS OF BEING IN THE RIGHT AND DESIROUS OF COMPLETELY VINDICATING HIMSELF FROM SUCH A CHARGE
7514-96429-0005 HE DID NOT ARROGANTLY REST ON A MERE DENIAL AND ON HIS GENERAL CHARACTER BUT PROCEEDED THUS
7514-96429-0006 I WAS VERY INTIMATE WITH THAT GENTLEMAN AND WAS ONCE RELIEVED BY HIM FROM AN ARREST BUT I NEVER WAS PRESENT WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED NEVER KNEW THAT HE WAS ARRESTED
7514-96429-0007 AND I BELIEVE HE NEVER WAS IN DIFFICULTIES AFTER THE TIME WHEN HE RELIEVED ME I LOVED HIM MUCH YET IN TALKING OF HIS GENERAL CHARACTER I MAY HAVE SAID THOUGH I DO NOT REMEMBER THAT I EVER DID SAY SO
7514-96429-0008 THAT AS HIS GENEROSITY PROCEEDED FROM NO PRINCIPLE BUT WAS A PART OF HIS PROFUSION HE WOULD DO FOR A DOG WHAT HE WOULD DO FOR A FRIEND BUT I NEVER APPLIED THIS REMARK TO ANY PARTICULAR INSTANCE
7514-96429-0009 AND CERTAINLY NOT TO HIS KINDNESS TO ME IF A PROFUSE MAN WHO DOES NOT VALUE HIS MONEY AND GIVES A LARGE SUM TO A WHORE
7514-96429-0010 GIVES HALF AS MUCH OR AN EQUALLY LARGE SUM TO RELIEVE A FRIEND IT CANNOT BE ESTEEMED AS VIRTUE
7514-96429-0011 AND IF SAID AT ALL IT MUST HAVE BEEN SAID AFTER HIS DEATH SIR I WOULD HAVE GONE TO THE WORLD'S END TO RELIEVE HIM THE REMARK ABOUT THE DOG IF MADE BY ME WAS SUCH A SALLY AS MIGHT ESCAPE ONE WHEN PAINTING A MAN HIGHLY
7514-96429-0012 ON TUESDAY SEPTEMBER TWENTY THIRD JOHNSON WAS REMARKABLY CORDIAL TO ME IT BEING NECESSARY FOR ME TO RETURN TO SCOTLAND SOON I HAD FIXED ON THE NEXT DAY FOR MY SETTING OUT
7514-96429-0013 AND I FELT A TENDER CONCERN AT THE THOUGHT OF PARTING WITH HIM HE HAD AT THIS TIME FRANKLY COMMUNICATED TO ME MANY PARTICULARS WHICH ARE INSERTED IN THIS WORK IN THEIR PROPER PLACES AND ONCE
7514-96429-0014 WHEN I HAPPENED TO MENTION THAT THE EXPENCE OF MY JAUNT WOULD COME TO MUCH MORE THAN I HAD COMPUTED HE SAID WHY SIR IF THE EXPENCE WERE TO BE AN INCONVENIENCE YOU WOULD HAVE REASON TO REGRET IT BUT IF YOU HAVE HAD THE MONEY TO SPEND
7514-96429-0015 I KNOW NOT THAT YOU COULD HAVE PURCHASED AS MUCH PLEASURE WITH IT IN ANY OTHER WAY DURING THIS INTERVIEW AT ASHBOURNE JOHNSON AND I FREQUENTLY TALKED WITH WONDERFUL PLEASURE OF MERE TRIFLES
7514-96429-0016 WHICH HAD OCCURRED IN OUR TOUR TO THE HEBRIDES FOR IT HAD LEFT A MOST AGREEABLE AND LASTING IMPRESSION UPON HIS MIND HE FOUND FAULT WITH ME FOR USING THE PHRASE TO MAKE MONEY
7514-96429-0017 YET WE HEAR THE SAGES OF THE LAW DELIVERING THEIR IDEAS UPON THE QUESTION UNDER CONSIDERATION AND THE FIRST SPEAKERS IN PARLIAMENT ENTIRELY COINCIDING IN THE IDEA
7514-96429-0018 WHICH HAS BEEN ABLY STATED BY AN HONOURABLE MEMBER OR
7514-96429-0019 FROM THE ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION OF THE SYLLABLE EAR AND HE THOUGHT IT BETTER NOT TO HAVE THAT EXCEPTION HE PRAISED GRAINGER'S ODE ON SOLITUDE IN DODSLEY'S COLLECTION
7514-96429-0020 AND REPEATED WITH GREAT ENERGY THE EXORDIUM
7514-96429-0021 OR CLIMB THE ANDES CLIFTED SIDE OR BY THE NILE'S COY SOURCE ABIDE OR STARTING FROM YOUR HALF YEAR'S SLEEP FROM HECLA VIEW THE THAWING DEEP
7514-96429-0022 OR AT THE PURPLE DAWN OF DAY
7514-96429-0023 ALTERNATE SENSATIONS OF PATHETICK DEJECTION SO THAT I WAS READY TO SHED TEARS AND OF DARING RESOLUTION SO THAT I WAS INCLINED TO RUSH INTO THE THICKEST PART OF THE BATTLE SIR SAID HE
7514-96429-0024 I SHOULD NEVER HEAR IT IF IT MADE ME SUCH A FOOL MUCH OF THE EFFECT OF MUSICK I AM SATISFIED IS OWING TO THE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS THAT AIR WHICH INSTANTLY AND IRRESISTIBLY EXCITES IN THE SWISS
7514-96429-0025 HAS I AM TOLD NO INTRINSICK POWER OF SOUND AND I KNOW FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE THAT SCOTCH REELS THOUGH BRISK MAKE ME MELANCHOLY BECAUSE I USED TO HEAR THEM
7514-96429-0026 IN MY EARLY YEARS AT A TIME WHEN MISTER PITT CALLED FOR SOLDIERS FROM THE MOUNTAINS OF THE NORTH AND NUMBERS OF BRAVE HIGHLANDERS WERE GOING ABROAD NEVER TO RETURN
7514-96429-0027 MANY OF WHICH ARE VERY SOFT NEVER FAIL TO RENDER ME GAY BECAUSE THEY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WARM SENSATIONS AND HIGH SPIRITS OF LONDON THIS EVENING
7514-96429-0028 WHILE SOME OF THE TUNES OF ORDINARY COMPOSITION WERE PLAYED WITH NO GREAT SKILL MY FRAME WAS AGITATED AND I WAS CONSCIOUS OF A GENEROUS ATTACHMENT TO DOCTOR JOHNSON AS MY PRECEPTOR AND FRIEND
7514-96429-0029 MIXED WITH AN AFFECTIONATE REGRET THAT HE WAS AN OLD MAN WHOM I SHOULD PROBABLY LOSE IN A SHORT TIME I THOUGHT I COULD DEFEND HIM AT THE POINT OF MY SWORD
7514-96429-0030 MY REVERENCE AND AFFECTION FOR HIM WERE IN FULL GLOW I SAID TO HIM MY DEAR SIR WE MUST MEET EVERY YEAR IF YOU DON'T QUARREL WITH ME JOHNSON NAY SIR YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO QUARREL WITH ME THAN I WITH YOU
7514-96429-0031 MY REGARD FOR YOU IS GREATER ALMOST THAN I HAVE WORDS TO EXPRESS BUT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO BE ALWAYS REPEATING IT
