2607-87140-0000 YOU PROCEED TO GIVE ME NOT THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE CASE BUT THE CASE ITSELF YOU HAVE REPEATEDLY SPOKEN OF THE MURDER HAVING TAKEN PLACE IN SOME PLACE WHICH IS DIFFICULT OF ACCESS AND UNDER MOST MYSTIFYING CIRCUMSTANCES
2607-87140-0001 NOW IF YOU DON'T MIND I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHAT THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE ALL RIGHT OLD CHAP I'LL GIVE YOU THE DETAILS AS BRIEFLY AS POSSIBLE
2607-87140-0002 IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU MUST KNOW THAT HEATHERINGTON HALL IS A VERY ANCIENT PLACE DATING BACK INDEED TO THOSE PLEASANT TIMES WHEN A NOBLEMAN'S HOME HAD TO BE SOMETHING OF A FORTRESS AS WELL
2607-87140-0003 IF HE DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE UP SOME FINE MORNING AND FIND HIS PLACE SACKED HIS ROOF BURNT OVER HIS HEAD AND HIMSELF AND HIS LADY EITHER HELD FOR RANSOM OR FREED FROM ANY POSSIBILITY OF HAVING HEADACHES THEREAFTER
2607-87140-0004 WAS THE USUAL MEANS OF DEFENCE ADOPTED YOU'LL SEE DOZENS OF THEM IN SUFFOLK DEAR CHAP BUT WHETHER FOR REASONS OF ECONOMY OR MERELY TO CARRY OUT SOME THEORY OF HIS OWN
2607-87140-0005 THE FIRST LORD OF HEATHERINGTON HALL DID NOT STICK TO THE GENERAL PLAN IN BRIEF INSTEAD OF BUILDING A TALL TOWER RISING FROM THE GROUND ITSELF
2607-87140-0006 HE CHOSE TO ERECT UPON THE ROOF OF THE WEST WING OF THE BUILDING A LOWER BUT MORE COMMODIOUS ONE THAN WAS CUSTOMARY
2607-87140-0007 ITS CIRCUMFERENCE WAS TWICE AS GREAT AND BY REASON OF THE DOUBLE SUPPLY OF BOWMAN'S SLITS EQUALLY AS EFFECTIVE IN WITHSTANDING A SIEGE
2607-87140-0008 AND INDEED DOUBLY DIFFICULT TO ASSAULT AS BEFORE AN INVADING FORCE COULD GET TO THE DOOR OF THE PLACE IT WOULD HAVE TO FIGHT ITS WAY UP THROUGH THE MAIN BUILDING TO REACH THE LEVEL OF IT
2607-87140-0009 NOW OWING TO THE PECULIARITY OF ITS CONSTRUCTION IT IS NOT MORE THAN EIGHTEEN FEET HIGH THE FACT THAT IT CONTAINED BUT ONE CIRCULAR ROOM AND ALL THOSE BOWMAN SLITS IN THE WALLS OF IT
2607-87140-0010 THIS UNUSUAL TOWER GAINED AN EQUALLY UNUSUAL NAME FOR ITSELF AND BECAME KNOWN EVERYWHERE AS THE STONE DRUM OF HEATHERINGTON
2607-87140-0011 AND IS EVEN MENTIONED BY THAT NAME IN THE INQUISITIO ELIENSIS OF THE DOMESDAY BOOK
2607-87140-0012 I SEE SAID CLEEK WITH AN AMUSED TWINKLE IN HIS EYE YOU ARE GETTING ON MISTER NARKOM WE SHALL HAVE YOU LECTURING ON ARCHAEOLOGY ONE OF THESE FINE DAYS
2607-87140-0013 BUT TO RETURN TO OUR MUTTON OR RATHER OUR STONE DRUM WAS IT IN THAT PLACE THEN THAT THE MURDER WAS COMMITTED YES
2607-87140-0014 IT IS ONE OF THE FEW VERY FEW PARTS OF THE BUILDING TO WHICH MISTER JEFFERSON P DRAKE DID NOTHING IN THE WAY OF MODERNIZING AND ADDED NOTHING IN THE WAY OF IMPROVEMENTS
2607-87140-0015 THAT PROBABLY WAS BECAUSE AS IT STOOD IT OFFERED HIM A QUIET SECLUDED AND EXCLUSIVE RETREAT FOR THE CARRYING ON OF HIS EXPERIMENTS FOR WEALTH HAD BROUGHT WITH IT NO INCLINATION TO RETIRE
2607-87140-0016 AND HE REMAINED TO THE LAST IN THE LISTS OF THE WORLD'S ACTIVE FORCES
2607-87140-0017 BUT CONDUCTED MOST OF HIS EXPERIMENTS IN THE DAYTIME BUT LAST NIGHT WAS AN EXCEPTION
2607-87140-0018 IT MAY BE THAT THE NEWS OF HIS SON'S APPEAL TO THE LODGEKEEPER THAT AFTERNOON HAD UPSET HIM FOR HE WAS RESTLESS AND PREOCCUPIED ALL THE EVENING LORD FALLOWFIELD SAYS
2607-87140-0019 IN THESE DAYS NO AMERICAN GENTLEMAN WITH ANY PRETENCE TO DISTINCTION WHATSOEVER WOULD BE WITHOUT ONE GO ON PLEASE HIS JAPANESE VALET CARRIED UP THE ICE WATER AND THEN WHAT
2607-87140-0020 THEN HE SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION OF GOING INTO THE STONE DRUM AND WORKING FOR A FEW HOURS LORD FALLOWFIELD IT APPEARS TRIED HIS BEST TO DISSUADE HIM BUT TO NO PURPOSE
2607-87140-0021 WHY DID HE DO THAT OR DON'T YOU KNOW YES I ASKED THAT VERY QUESTION MYSELF I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS BECAUSE HIS LORDSHIP SAW VERY PLAINLY THAT HE WAS LABOURING UNDER STRONG MENTAL EXCITEMENT
2607-87140-0022 AND HE THOUGHT THAT REST WOULD BE THE BEST THING FOR HIM IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THEN TOO HIS LORDSHIP AND HE ARE WARMLY ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER IN FACT THE EARL WAS AS FOND OF HIM AS IF HE HAD BEEN A BROTHER
2607-87140-0023 AS WELL HE OUGHT TO BE BY JAMES WHEN YOU RECOLLECT THAT BEFORE HE GOT THE IDEA INTO HIS HEAD OF MARRYING HIS SON TO LADY MARJORIE HE ADDED A CODICIL TO HIS WILL BEQUEATHING THE PLACE TO LORD FALLOWFIELD
2607-87140-0024 TOGETHER WITH ALL THE ACRES AND ACRES OF LAND HE HAD ADDED TO IT AND ALL THE ART TREASURES HE HAD COLLECTED ABSOLUTELY FREE FROM DEATH DUTIES OHO SAID CLEEK THEN SMILED AND PINCHED HIS CHIN AND SAID NO MORE
2607-87140-0025 AND THAT NOTHING WAS WANTING THAT MIGHT TEND TO THE COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE OF A NIGHT WORKER WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING MORE THAT COULD BE DONE THE VALET WAS DISMISSED HIS LORDSHIP SAID GOOD NIGHT TO HIS FRIEND AND LEFT HIM THERE ALONE
2607-87140-0026 HEARING AS HE PASSED ALONG THE RAILED WALK OVER THE ROOF OF THE WING TO THE BUILDING PROPER A MATTER OF SOME TWENTY ODD FEET THE SOUND OF THE BOLT BEING SHOT THE BAR PUT ON AND THE KEY BEING TURNED AS MISTER DRAKE LOCKED HIMSELF IN
2607-87140-0027 AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING THE VALET GOING TO HIS MASTER'S ROOM WITH HIS SHAVING WATER FOUND THAT HE HAD NEVER GONE TO BED AT ALL
2607-87140-0028 AND ON HASTENING TO THE STONE DRUM FOUND THAT A LIGHT WAS STILL BURNING WITHIN AND FAINTLY ILLUMINATING THE BOWMAN'S SLITS BUT ALTHOUGH HE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR AND CALLED AGAIN AND AGAIN TO HIS MASTER HE COULD GET NO ANSWER
2607-87140-0029 ALARMED HE AROUSED THE ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD BUT DESPITE THE FACT THAT A DOZEN PERSONS ENDEAVOURED TO GET WORD FROM THE MAN WITHIN NOT SO MUCH AS A WHISPER REWARDED THEM
2607-87140-0030 THE BOLT WAS STILL SHOT THE BAR STILL ON THE KEY STILL TURNED ON THE INNER SIDE OF THE DOOR SO THEY COULD FORCE NO ENTRY TO THE PLACE
2607-87140-0031 AND IT WAS NEVER UNTIL THE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH HAD BEEN CALLED IN AND HIS SLEDGE HAD BATTERED DOWN THE AGE WEAKENED MASONRY IN WHICH THAT DOOR WAS SET
2607-87140-0032 THAT ANY MAN KNEW FOR CERTAIN WHAT THAT BURNING LIGHT AND THAT UNBROKEN SILENCE PORTENDED
2607-87140-0033 WHEN HOWEVER THEY FINALLY GOT INTO THE PLACE THERE LAY THE ONCE FAMOUS INVENTOR AT FULL LENGTH ON THE OAKEN FLOOR CLOSE TO THE BARRED DOOR AS DEAD AS GEORGE WASHINGTON
2607-87140-0034 AND WITH NEVER A SIGN OF WHAT KILLED HIM EITHER ON THE BODY OR IN ANY PART OF THE PLACE YET THE FIRST LOOK AT HIS DISTORTED FEATURES WAS SUFFICIENT TO PROVE THAT HE HAD DIED IN AGONY
2607-87140-0035 AND THE POSITION OF THE CORPSE SHOWED CLEARLY THAT WHEN THE END CAME HE WAS ENDEAVOURING TO GET TO THE DOOR HEART FAILURE POSSIBLY SAID CLEEK NOT A HOPE OF IT REPLIED NARKOM
2607-87140-0036 A DOCTOR WAS SENT FOR IMMEDIATELY FORTUNATELY ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS SURGEONS IN ENGLAND HAPPENED TO BE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AT THE TIME
2607-87140-0037 HE IS WILLING SO YOUNG MISTER DRAKE TELLS ME TO STAKE HIS PROFESSIONAL REPUTATION THAT THE MAN'S HEART WAS AS SOUND AS A GUINEA THAT HE HAD NOT IMBIBED ONE DROP OF ANYTHING POISONOUS
2607-87140-0038 THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ASPHYXIATED AS OF COURSE HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN FOR THE BOWMAN'S SLITS IN THE WALL GAVE FREE VENTILATION TO THE PLACE IF NOTHING MORE
2607-87140-0039 THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN SHOT STABBED OR BLUDGEONED BUT NEVERTHELESS HE HAD DIED BY VIOLENCE AND THAT VIOLENCE WAS NOT AND COULD NOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO SUICIDE FOR THERE WAS EVERYTHING TO PROVE TO THE CONTRARY
2607-87140-0040 IN SHORT THAT WHATEVER HAD ATTACKED HIM HAD DONE SO UNEXPECTEDLY AND WHILE HE WAS BUSY AT HIS WORK TABLE FOR THERE WAS THE CHAIR LYING ON ITS BACK BEFORE IT JUST AS IT HAD FALLEN OVER WHEN HE JUMPED UP FROM HIS SEAT
2607-87140-0041 AND THERE ON THE WORKING PLAN HE WAS DRAWING UP WAS THE PEN LYING ON A BLOB OF INDIA INK JUST AS IT HAD DROPPED FROM HIS HAND WHEN HE WAS STRICKEN
2607-87140-0042 SOME MURDEROUS FORCE HAD ENTERED THAT ROOM AND PASSED OUT OF IT AGAIN LEAVING THE DOOR BARRED BOLTED AND LOCKED UPON THE INSIDE
2607-87140-0043 SOME WEAPON HAD BEEN USED AND YET NO WEAPON WAS THERE AND NO TRACE UPON THE BODY TO INDICATE WHAT ITS CHARACTER MIGHT BE
2607-87140-0044 INDEED EVERYTHING IN THE ROOM WAS PRECISELY AS IT HAD BEEN WHEN LORD FALLOWFIELD WALKED OUT LAST NIGHT AND LEFT HIM
2607-87140-0045 BEYOND THE FACT OF THE OVERTURNED CHAIR AND A LITTLE PUDDLE OF CLEAR WATER LYING ABOUT A YARD OR SO FROM THE WORK TABLE AND OWING TO THE WAXING AND POLISHING NOT YET ABSORBED BY THE WOOD OF THE FLOOR
2607-87140-0046 THE DOCTOR TOOK A SMALL SAMPLE OF THAT WATER AND ANALYZED IT IT WAS SIMPLY PLAIN EVERYDAY COMMON OR GARDEN PURE WATER AND NOTHING MORE
2607-87140-0047 WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF ANY FOREIGN MATTER OR OF ANY POISONOUS SUBSTANCE IN IT WHATSOEVER THERE OLD CHAP THAT'S THE CASE' THAT'S THE LITTLE RIDDLE YOU'RE ASKED TO COME DOWN AND SOLVE
2607-87140-0048 AND THE DOCTOR
