5649-40567-0000 AMONG THE SMALLER PRINCIPALITIES OF ITALY DURING THE FIFTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH CENTURIES NONE WAS MORE BRILLIANT THAN THE COURT OF FERRARA AND NONE MORE INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH THE LITERATURE OF THE TIMES HERE ON SEPTEMBER EIGHTH FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
5649-40567-0001 WAS BORN LUDOVICO ARIOSTO THE GREAT POET OF THE RENAISSANCE HERE LIKE BOIARDO BEFORE HIM AND TASSO AFTER HIM HE LIVED AND WROTE
5649-40567-0002 IN WHICH ARE SEEN AS IN A MIRROR THE GAY LIFE THE INTELLECTUAL BRILLIANCY AND THE SENSUOUS LOVE FOR BEAUTY WHICH MARK THE AGE AT SEVENTEEN HE BEGAN THE STUDY OF THE LAW WHICH HE SOON ABANDONED FOR THE CHARMS OF LETTERS MOST OF HIS LIFE WAS PASSED IN THE SERVICE
5649-40567-0003 AND AFTERWARD OF THE DUKE OF FERRARA BUT THE COURTIER NEVER OVERCAME THE POET
5649-40567-0004 THE LITERARY ACTIVITY OF ARIOSTO SHOWED ITSELF IN THE COMPOSITION OF COMEDIES AND SATIRES AS WELL AS IN THAT OF HIS IMMORTAL EPIC
5649-40567-0005 THE LATER COMEDIES ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE EARLY ONES WHICH ARE BUT LITTLE MORE THAN TRANSLATIONS FROM PLAUTUS AND TERENCE IN GENERAL HOWEVER THE EFFORTS OF ARIOSTO IN THIS DIRECTION ARE FAR LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE ORLANDO OR THE SATIRES
5649-40567-0006 AND WAS THE LEADER OF THAT MOVEMENT IN ITALY AND FRANCE WHICH PREPARED THE WAY FOR MOLIERE OF MORE IMPORTANCE THAN THE COMEDIES AND SECOND ONLY IN INTEREST TO THE ORLANDO ARE THE SATIRES SEVEN IN NUMBER THE FIRST WRITTEN IN FIFTEEN SEVENTEEN
5649-40567-0007 NOR A MAN OF AFFAIRS AND HIS LIFE AS AMBASSADOR OF CARDINAL IPPOLITO
5649-40567-0008 WAS NOT AT ALL TO HIS LIKING
5649-40567-0009 HE WAS NOT STIRRED TO PROFOUND INDIGNATION BY THE EVILS ABOUT HIM OF WHICH THERE WERE ENOUGH IN THAT BRILLIANT BUT CORRUPT AGE HE DISCUSSED IN EASY FAMILIAR STYLE THE FOIBLES OF HIS FELLOW MEN AND ESPECIALLY THE EVENTS OF HIS OWN LIFE
5649-40567-0010 AND THE TRAITS OF HIS OWN CHARACTER THE SAME VIEWS OF LIFE THE SAME TOLERANT TEMPER WHICH ARE SEEN IN THE SATIRES FORM AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE ORLANDO FURIOSO WHERE THEY TAKE THE FORM OF LITTLE DISSERTATIONS
5649-40567-0011 INTRODUCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A CANTO OR SCATTERED THROUGH THE BODY OF THE POEM THESE REFLECTIONS ARE FULL OF PRACTICAL SENSE AND WISDOM AND REMIND US OF THE FAMILIAR CONVERSATION WITH THE READER WHICH FORMS SO GREAT A CHARM IN THACKERAY'S NOVELS
5649-40567-0012 IN THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE THERE IS A CURIOUS MINGLING OF CLASSICAL AND ROMANTIC INFLUENCES AND THE GENERATION WHICH GAVE ITSELF UP PASSIONATELY TO THE STUDY OF GREEK AND LATIN STILL READ WITH DELIGHT
5649-40567-0013 THE STORIES OF THE PALADINS OF CHARLEMAGNE AND THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE WHAT SIR THOMAS MALORY HAD DONE IN ENGLISH PROSE BOIARDO DID IN LATIN POETRY WHEN ARIOSTO ENTERED THE SERVICE OF CARDINAL IPPOLITO
5649-40567-0014 UNDER KING AGRAMANTE DRIVING THE ARMY OF CHARLEMAGNE BEFORE THEM UNTIL THE CHRISTIANS HAD FINALLY BEEN SHUT UP WITHIN THE WALLS OF PARIS IT WAS AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT IN HIS POEM THAT BOIARDO DIED
5649-40567-0015 ARIOSTO TOOK UP THE STORY WHERE HE HAD LEFT IT AND CARRIED IT ON UNTIL THE FINAL DEFEAT OF AGRAMANTE AND HIS DEATH AT THE HANDS OF ORLANDO
5649-40567-0016 AND BY MEANS OF WINGED HORSES TREMENDOUS DISTANCES ARE TRAVELED OVER IN A DAY ON CLOSER EXAMINATION WE FIND THAT THIS CONFUSION IS ONLY APPARENT THE POET HIMSELF IS NEVER CONFUSED BUT WITH SURE HAND
5649-40567-0017 HE MANIPULATES THE MANY COLORED THREADS WHICH ARE WROUGHT INTO THE FABRIC OF THE POEM
5649-40567-0018 AND BOTH AFFORD SOME OF THE FINEST EPISODES HAVE NO ORGANIC CONNECTION WITH THE WHOLE THE REAL SUBJECT IF ANY THERE BE IS THE LOVES OF RUGGIERO AND BRADAMANTE
5649-40567-0019 AND IT IS WITH THEIR FINAL UNION AFTER MANY VICISSITUDES THAT THE POEM ENDS BUT THE REAL PURPOSE OF ARIOSTO WAS TO AMUSE THE READER BY COUNTLESS STORIES OF ROMANTIC ADVENTURE IT WAS NOT AS A GREAT CREATIVE GENIUS
5649-40567-0020 THAT LOVE FOR FORM THAT PERFECTION OF STYLE WHICH IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE LATIN RACES AS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE TEUTONIC IT IS THIS THAT MAKES THE ORLANDO FURIOSO THE GREAT EPIC OF THE RENAISSANCE
5649-40567-0021 AND THAT CAUSED GALILEO TO BESTOW UPON THE POET THE EPITHET DIVINE FOR NEARLY THIRTY YEARS ARIOSTO CHANGED AND POLISHED THESE LINES
5649-40567-0022 SO THAT THE EDITION OF FIFTEEN THIRTY TWO IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE STANZAS IN WHICH THE POEM IS WRITTEN ARE SMOOTH AND MUSICAL THE LANGUAGE IS SO CHOSEN AS ALWAYS TO EXPRESS THE EXACT SHADE OF THOUGHT
5649-40567-0023 THE INTEREST NEVER FLAGS WHAT SEEMS THE ARBITRARY BREAKING OFF OF A STORY BEFORE ITS CLOSE IS REALLY THE ART OF THE POET FOR HE KNOWS WERE EACH EPISODE TO BE TOLD BY ITSELF WE SHOULD HAVE ONLY A STRING OF NOVELLE
5649-40567-0024 ITS HIPPOGRIFFS AND DRAGONS AND ALL THE PARAPHERNALIA OF MAGIC ART ARIOSTO'S TREATMENT OF CHIVALRY IS PECULIAR TO HIMSELF SPENSER IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY AND LORD TENNYSON IN OUR OWN DAY
5649-40567-0025 NOR DID THE POET HIMSELF HENCE THERE IS AN AIR OF UNREALITY ABOUT THE POEM THE FIGURES THAT PASS BEFORE US ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THEIR OWN ARE NOT REAL BEINGS BUT THOSE THAT DWELL IN A LAND OF FANCY
5649-40567-0026 AND THE VOYAGE OF ASTOLFO TO THE MOON HE DOES APPROACH DANGEROUSLY NEAR TO THE BURLESQUE WE ARE NOT INSPIRED BY LARGE AND NOBLE THOUGHTS IN READING THE ORLANDO FURIOSO
5649-40567-0027 NO LOFTY PRINCIPLES ARE INCULCATED EVEN THE PATHETIC SCENES SUCH AS THE DEATH OF ZERBINO AND ISABELLA STIR NO REAL EMOTION IN US BUT WE EXPERIENCE A SENSE OF THE ARTISTIC EFFECT OF A POETIC DEATH IT IS NOT OFTEN
5649-40567-0028 WITH SERIOUS PURPOSE WILL SOON FIND HIMSELF UNDER THE SPELL OF AN ATTRACTION WHICH COMES FROM UNFLAGGING INTEREST AND FROM PERFECTION OF STYLE AND CONSTRUCTION NO TRANSLATION CAN CONVEY AN ADEQUATE SENSE OF THIS BEAUTY OF COLOR AND FORM
