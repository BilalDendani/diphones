1132-145024-0000 DECLINING HEALTH OF JANE AUSTEN ELASTICITY OF HER SPIRITS HER RESIGNATION AND HUMILITY HER DEATH EARLY IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN
1132-145024-0001 AND RECALLED OLD RECOLLECTIONS CONNECTED WITH THEM IN A PARTICULAR MANNER AS IF SHE DID NOT EXPECT EVER TO SEE THEM AGAIN
1132-145024-0002 SOME OF HER LETTERS WERE OF A GRAVER TONE THAN HAD BEEN CUSTOMARY WITH HER AND EXPRESSED RESIGNATION RATHER THAN CHEERFULNESS IN REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES IN A LETTER TO HER BROTHER CHARLES AFTER MENTIONING THAT SHE HAD BEEN LAID UP WITH AN ATTACK OF BILIOUS FEVER
1132-145024-0003 SHE SAYS I LIVE UP STAIRS FOR THE PRESENT AND AM CODDLED I AM THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHO HAS BEEN SO SILLY BUT A WEAK BODY MUST EXCUSE WEAK NERVES AND AGAIN TO ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT BUT I AM GETTING TOO NEAR COMPLAINT
1132-145024-0004 IT HAS BEEN THE APPOINTMENT OF GOD HOWEVER SECONDARY CAUSES MAY HAVE OPERATED BUT THE ELASTICITY OF HER SPIRITS SOON RECOVERED THEIR TONE IT WAS IN THE LATTER HALF OF THAT YEAR
1132-145024-0005 TO A NEPHEW ONE WHILE HE WAS AT WINCHESTER SCHOOL THE OTHER SOON AFTER HE HAD LEFT IT CHAWTON JULY NINTH EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN MY DEAR E MANY THANKS
1132-145024-0006 A THANK FOR EVERY LINE AND AS MANY TO MISTER W DIGWEED FOR COMING WE HAVE BEEN WANTING VERY MUCH TO HEAR OF YOUR MOTHER AND ARE HAPPY TO FIND SHE CONTINUES TO MEND BUT HER ILLNESS MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY SERIOUS ONE INDEED
1132-145024-0007 WHEN SHE IS REALLY RECOVERED SHE OUGHT TO TRY CHANGE OF AIR AND COME OVER TO US TELL YOUR FATHER THAT I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM FOR HIS SHARE OF YOUR LETTER AND MOST SINCERELY JOIN IN THE HOPE OF HER BEING EVENTUALLY MUCH THE BETTER
1132-145024-0008 FOR HER PRESENT DISCIPLINE SHE HAS THE COMFORT MOREOVER OF BEING CONFINED IN SUCH WEATHER AS GIVES ONE LITTLE TEMPTATION TO BE OUT IT IS REALLY TOO BAD AND HAS BEEN TOO BAD FOR A LONG TIME
1132-145024-0009 MUCH WORSE THAN ANY ONE CAN BEAR AND I BEGIN TO THINK IT WILL NEVER BE FINE AGAIN THIS IS A FINESSE OF MINE FOR I HAVE OFTEN OBSERVED THAT IF ONE WRITES ABOUT THE WEATHER IT IS GENERALLY COMPLETELY CHANGED BEFORE THE LETTER IS READ
1132-145024-0010 I WISH IT MAY PROVE SO NOW AND THAT WHEN MISTER W DIGWEED REACHES STEVENTON TO MORROW
1132-145024-0011 THAT YOU MIGHT BE DETAINED AT WINCHESTER BY SEVERE ILLNESS
1132-145024-0012 AND QUITE UNABLE TO HOLD A PEN AND ONLY DATING FROM STEVENTON IN ORDER WITH A MISTAKEN SORT OF TENDERNESS
1132-145024-0013 WHICH WENT BY THE CHEESE I CANNOT BEAR NOT TO BE THANKED YOU WILL NOT PAY US A VISIT YET OF COURSE WE MUST NOT THINK OF IT YOUR MOTHER MUST GET WELL FIRST AND YOU MUST GO TO OXFORD
1132-145024-0014 AS I WANTED TO SEE THE IMPROVEMENT MISTER WOOLLS IS MAKING
1132-145024-0015 BUT NOT SOON ENOUGH TO AVOID A PELTER ALL THE WAY HOME WE MET MISTER WOOLLS I TALKED OF ITS BEING BAD WEATHER FOR THE HAY AND HE RETURNED ME THE COMFORT OF ITS BEING MUCH WORSE FOR THE WHEAT WE HEAR THAT MISSUS S DOES NOT QUIT TANGIER
1132-145024-0016 DO YOU KNOW THAT OUR BROWNING IS GONE YOU MUST PREPARE FOR A WILLIAM WHEN YOU COME A GOOD LOOKING LAD CIVIL AND QUIET AND SEEMING LIKELY TO DO
1132-145024-0017 WILL BE ASTONISHED AT MY WRITING SO MUCH
1132-145024-0018 JANE AUSTEN IN THE NEXT LETTER WILL BE FOUND HER DESCRIPTION OF HER OWN STYLE OF COMPOSITION WHICH HAS ALREADY APPEARED
1132-145024-0019 CHAWTON MONDAY DECEMBER SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN MY DEAR E ONE REASON FOR MY WRITING TO YOU NOW IS THAT I MAY HAVE THE PLEASURE
1132-145024-0020 I GIVE YOU JOY OF HAVING LEFT WINCHESTER NOW YOU MAY OWN HOW MISERABLE YOU WERE THERE NOW IT WILL GRADUALLY ALL COME OUT YOUR CRIMES AND YOUR MISERIES HOW OFTEN YOU WENT UP BY THE MAIL TO LONDON AND THREW AWAY FIFTY GUINEAS AT A TAVERN
1132-145024-0021 AND HOW OFTEN YOU WERE ON THE POINT OF HANGING YOURSELF RESTRAINED ONLY AS SOME ILL NATURED ASPERSION UPON POOR OLD WINTON HAS IT BY THE WANT OF A TREE WITHIN SOME MILES OF THE CITY CHARLES KNIGHT AND HIS COMPANIONS PASSED THROUGH CHAWTON
1132-145024-0022 ABOUT NINE THIS MORNING LATER THAN IT USED TO BE UNCLE HENRY AND I HAD A GLIMPSE OF HIS HANDSOME FACE LOOKING ALL HEALTH AND GOOD HUMOUR I WONDER WHEN YOU WILL COME AND SEE US I KNOW WHAT I RATHER SPECULATE UPON
1132-145024-0023 BUT SHALL SAY NOTHING WE THINK UNCLE HENRY IN EXCELLENT LOOKS LOOK AT HIM THIS MOMENT AND THINK SO TOO IF YOU HAVE NOT DONE IT BEFORE AND WE HAVE THE GREAT COMFORT OF SEEING DECIDED IMPROVEMENT IN UNCLE CHARLES
1132-145024-0024 BOTH AS TO HEALTH SPIRITS AND APPEARANCE AND THEY ARE EACH OF THEM SO AGREEABLE IN THEIR DIFFERENT WAY AND HARMONISE SO WELL THAT THEIR VISIT IS THOROUGH ENJOYMENT UNCLE HENRY WRITES VERY SUPERIOR SERMONS
1132-145024-0025 YOU AND I MUST TRY TO GET HOLD OF ONE OR TWO AND PUT THEM INTO OUR NOVELS IT WOULD BE A FINE HELP TO A VOLUME AND WE COULD MAKE OUR HEROINE READ IT ALOUD ON A SUNDAY EVENING JUST AS WELL AS ISABELLA WARDOUR IN THE ANTIQUARY
1132-145024-0026 IN THE RUINS OF SAINT RUTH THOUGH I BELIEVE ON RECOLLECTION LOVELL IS THE READER BY THE BYE MY DEAR E I AM QUITE CONCERNED FOR THE LOSS YOUR MOTHER MENTIONS IN HER LETTER TWO CHAPTERS AND A HALF TO BE MISSING IS MONSTROUS
1132-145024-0027 AND THEREFORE CANNOT BE SUSPECTED OF PURLOINING THEM TWO STRONG TWIGS AND A HALF TOWARDS A NEST OF MY OWN WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING I DO NOT THINK HOWEVER THAT ANY THEFT OF THAT SORT
1132-145024-0028 WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH YOUR STRONG MANLY VIGOROUS SKETCHES FULL OF VARIETY AND GLOW HOW COULD I POSSIBLY JOIN THEM ON TO THE LITTLE BIT TWO INCHES WIDE OF IVORY ON WHICH I WORK WITH SO FINE A BRUSH AS PRODUCES LITTLE EFFECT AFTER MUCH LABOUR
1132-145024-0029 YOU WILL HEAR FROM UNCLE HENRY HOW WELL ANNA IS SHE SEEMS PERFECTLY RECOVERED BEN WAS HERE ON SATURDAY TO ASK UNCLE CHARLES AND ME TO DINE WITH THEM AS TO MORROW BUT I WAS FORCED TO DECLINE IT THE WALK IS BEYOND MY STRENGTH
1132-145024-0030 THOUGH I AM OTHERWISE VERY WELL AND THIS IS NOT A SEASON FOR DONKEY CARRIAGES AND AS WE DO NOT LIKE TO SPARE UNCLE CHARLES HE HAS DECLINED IT TOO TUESDAY AH AH MISTER E
1132-145024-0031 I DOUBT YOUR SEEING UNCLE HENRY AT STEVENTON TO DAY THE WEATHER WILL PREVENT YOUR EXPECTING HIM I THINK TELL YOUR FATHER WITH AUNT CASS'S LOVE AND MINE THAT THE PICKLED CUCUMBERS ARE EXTREMELY GOOD AND TELL HIM ALSO TELL HIM WHAT YOU WILL
1132-145024-0032 NO DON'T TELL HIM WHAT YOU WILL BUT TELL HIM THAT GRANDMAMMA BEGS HIM TO MAKE JOSEPH HALL PAY HIS RENT IF HE CAN YOU MUST NOT BE TIRED OF READING THE WORD UNCLE FOR I HAVE NOT DONE WITH IT
1132-145024-0033 UNCLE CHARLES THANKS YOUR MOTHER FOR HER LETTER IT WAS A GREAT PLEASURE TO HIM TO KNOW THAT THE PARCEL WAS RECEIVED AND GAVE SO MUCH SATISFACTION AND HE BEGS HER TO BE SO GOOD AS TO GIVE THREE SHILLINGS FOR HIM
1132-145024-0034 J AUSTEN I CANNOT TELL HOW SOON SHE WAS AWARE OF THE SERIOUS NATURE OF HER MALADY BY GOD'S MERCY IT WAS NOT ATTENDED WITH MUCH SUFFERING SO THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO TELL HER FRIENDS AS IN THE FOREGOING LETTER
1132-145024-0035 AND PERHAPS SOMETIMES TO PERSUADE HERSELF THAT EXCEPTING WANT OF STRENGTH SHE WAS OTHERWISE VERY WELL BUT THE PROGRESS OF THE DISEASE BECAME MORE AND MORE MANIFEST AS THE YEAR ADVANCED THE USUAL WALK
1132-145024-0036 WAS AT FIRST SHORTENED AND THEN DISCONTINUED AND AIR WAS SOUGHT IN A DONKEY CARRIAGE GRADUALLY TOO HER HABITS OF ACTIVITY WITHIN THE HOUSE CEASED AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LIE DOWN MUCH THE SITTING ROOM CONTAINED ONLY ONE SOFA
1132-145024-0037 WHICH WAS FREQUENTLY OCCUPIED BY HER MOTHER WHO WAS MORE THAN SEVENTY YEARS OLD JANE WOULD NEVER USE IT EVEN IN HER MOTHER'S ABSENCE BUT SHE CONTRIVED A SORT OF COUCH FOR HERSELF WITH TWO OR THREE CHAIRS
1132-145024-0038 AND WAS PLEASED TO SAY THAT THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS MORE COMFORTABLE TO HER THAN A REAL SOFA HER REASONS FOR THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN LEFT TO BE GUESSED BUT FOR THE IMPORTUNITIES OF A LITTLE NIECE WHICH OBLIGED HER TO EXPLAIN THAT IF SHE HERSELF HAD SHOWN ANY INCLINATION TO USE THE SOFA
1132-145024-0039 HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE SCRUPLED BEING ON IT SO MUCH AS WAS GOOD FOR HER IT IS CERTAIN HOWEVER THAT THE MIND DID NOT SHARE IN THIS DECAY OF THE BODILY STRENGTH PERSUASION WAS NOT FINISHED BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST IN THAT YEAR AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS THEN COMPLETED
1132-145024-0040 AFFORDS PROOF THAT NEITHER THE CRITICAL NOR THE CREATIVE POWERS OF THE AUTHOR WERE AT ALL IMPAIRED THE BOOK HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO AN END IN JULY AND THE RE ENGAGEMENT OF THE HERO AND HEROINE EFFECTED IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT MANNER IN A SCENE
1132-145024-0041 LAID AT ADMIRAL CROFT'S LODGINGS BUT HER PERFORMANCE DID NOT SATISFY HER SHE THOUGHT IT TAME AND FLAT AND WAS DESIROUS OF PRODUCING SOMETHING BETTER THIS WEIGHED UPON HER MIND THE MORE SO PROBABLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE WEAK STATE OF HER HEALTH
1132-145024-0042 THE SENSE OF POWER REVIVED AND IMAGINATION RESUMED ITS COURSE SHE CANCELLED THE CONDEMNED CHAPTER AND WROTE TWO OTHERS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT IN ITS STEAD
1132-145024-0043 OF THE MUSGROVE PARTY TO BATH THE CROWDED AND ANIMATED SCENES AT THE WHITE HART HOTEL AND THE CHARMING CONVERSATION BETWEEN CAPTAIN HARVILLE AND ANNE ELLIOT OVERHEARD BY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH BY WHICH THE TWO FAITHFUL LOVERS
1132-145024-0044 WERE AT LAST LED TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER'S FEELINGS THE TENTH AND ELEVENTH CHAPTERS OF PERSUASION THEN RATHER THAN THE ACTUAL WINDING UP OF THE STORY CONTAIN THE LATEST OF HER PRINTED COMPOSITIONS HER LAST CONTRIBUTION TO THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE PUBLIC
1132-145024-0045 THREE DAYS BEFORE SHE BEGAN HER LAST WORK WHICH WILL BE NOTICED IN ANOTHER CHAPTER AND SHOWS THAT SHE WAS NOT AT THAT TIME AWARE OF THE SERIOUS NATURE OF HER MALADY CHAWTON JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH
1132-145024-0046 EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN MY DEAR ALETHEA I THINK IT TIME THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE WRITING BETWEEN US THOUGH I BELIEVE THE EPISTOLARY DEBT IS ON YOUR SIDE AND I HOPE
1132-145024-0047 NEITHER CARRIED AWAY BY THE FLOOD NOR RHEUMATIC THROUGH THE DAMPS SUCH MILD WEATHER IS YOU KNOW DELIGHTFUL TO US AND THOUGH WE HAVE A GREAT MANY PONDS AND A FINE RUNNING STREAM THROUGH THE MEADOWS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD IT IS NOTHING
1132-145024-0048 BUT WHAT BEAUTIFIES US AND DOES TO TALK OF I HAVE CERTAINLY GAINED STRENGTH THROUGH THE WINTER AND AM NOT FAR FROM BEING WELL AND I THINK I UNDERSTAND MY OWN CASE NOW SO MUCH BETTER THAN I DID AS TO BE ABLE BY CARE
1132-145024-0049 TO KEEP OFF ANY SERIOUS RETURN OF ILLNESS I AM CONVINCED THAT BILE IS AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL I HAVE SUFFERED
1132-145024-0050 THUS MUCH OF ME I AM SURE WE HAVE JUST HAD A FEW DAYS VISIT FROM EDWARD WHO BROUGHT US A GOOD ACCOUNT OF HIS FATHER AND THE VERY CIRCUMSTANCE OF HIS COMING AT ALL OF HIS FATHER'S BEING ABLE TO SPARE HIM IS ITSELF A GOOD ACCOUNT
1132-145024-0051 HE GROWS STILL AND STILL IMPROVES IN APPEARANCE AT LEAST IN THE ESTIMATION OF HIS AUNTS WHO LOVE HIM BETTER AND BETTER AS THEY SEE THE SWEET TEMPER AND WARM AFFECTIONS OF THE BOY CONFIRMED
1132-145024-0052 THOUGH WE HEAR THAT HE ACQUITS HIMSELF WITH AS MUCH EASE AND COLLECTEDNESS AS IF HE HAD BEEN USED TO IT ALL HIS LIFE WE HAVE NO CHANCE WE KNOW OF SEEING YOU BETWEEN STREATHAM AND WINCHESTER YOU GO THE OTHER ROAD AND ARE ENGAGED TO TWO OR THREE HOUSES
1132-145024-0053 IF THERE SHOULD BE ANY CHANGE HOWEVER YOU KNOW HOW WELCOME YOU WOULD BE WE HAVE BEEN READING THE POET'S PILGRIMAGE TO WATERLOO AND GENERALLY WITH MUCH APPROBATION NOTHING WILL PLEASE ALL THE WORLD YOU KNOW
1132-145024-0054 BUT PARTS OF IT SUIT ME BETTER THAN MUCH THAT HE HAS WRITTEN BEFORE THE OPENING THE PROEM I BELIEVE HE CALLS IT IS VERY BEAUTIFUL POOR MAN
1132-145024-0055 J AUSTEN THE REAL OBJECT OF THIS LETTER IS TO ASK YOU FOR A RECEIPT BUT I THOUGHT IT GENTEEL NOT TO LET IT APPEAR EARLY WE REMEMBER SOME EXCELLENT ORANGE WINE AT MANYDOWN MADE FROM SEVILLE ORANGES ENTIRELY OR CHIEFLY
1132-145024-0056 I SHOULD BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR THE RECEIPT IF YOU CAN COMMAND IT WITHIN A FEW WEEKS ON THE DAY BEFORE JANUARY TWENTY THIRD SHE HAD WRITTEN TO HER NIECE IN THE SAME HOPEFUL TONE I FEEL MYSELF GETTING STRONGER THAN I WAS
1132-145024-0057 AND CAN SO PERFECTLY WALK TO ALTON OR BACK AGAIN WITHOUT FATIGUE THAT I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO DO BOTH WHEN SUMMER COMES ALAS SUMMER CAME TO HER ONLY ON HER DEATHBED MARCH
1132-145024-0058 SEVENTEENTH IS THE LAST DATE TO BE FOUND IN THE MANUSCRIPT ON WHICH SHE WAS ENGAGED AND AS THE WATCH OF THE DROWNED MAN INDICATES THE TIME OF HIS DEATH SO DOES THIS FINAL DATE SEEM TO FIX THE PERIOD WHEN HER MIND COULD NO LONGER PURSUE ITS ACCUSTOMED COURSE AND HERE
1132-145024-0059 I CANNOT DO BETTER THAN QUOTE THE WORDS OF THE NIECE TO WHOSE PRIVATE RECORDS OF HER AUNT'S LIFE AND CHARACTER I HAVE BEEN SO OFTEN INDEBTED I DO NOT KNOW HOW EARLY THE ALARMING SYMPTOMS OF HER MALADY CAME ON
1132-145024-0060 IT WAS IN THE FOLLOWING MARCH THAT I HAD THE FIRST IDEA OF HER BEING SERIOUSLY ILL IT HAD BEEN SETTLED THAT ABOUT THE END OF THAT MONTH OR THE BEGINNING OF APRIL I SHOULD SPEND A FEW DAYS AT CHAWTON IN THE ABSENCE OF MY FATHER AND MOTHER
1132-145024-0061 WHO WERE JUST THEN ENGAGED WITH MISSUS LEIGH PERROT IN ARRANGING HER LATE HUSBAND'S AFFAIRS BUT AUNT JANE BECAME TOO ILL TO HAVE ME IN THE HOUSE AND SO I WENT INSTEAD TO MY SISTER MISSUS LEFROY AT WYARDS THE NEXT DAY WE WALKED OVER TO CHAWTON
1132-145024-0062 TO MAKE ENQUIRIES AFTER OUR AUNT SHE WAS THEN KEEPING HER ROOM BUT SAID SHE WOULD SEE US AND WE WENT UP TO HER SHE WAS IN HER DRESSING GOWN AND WAS SITTING QUITE LIKE AN INVALID IN AN ARM CHAIR BUT SHE GOT UP AND KINDLY GREETED US AND THEN
1132-145024-0063 POINTING TO SEATS WHICH HAD BEEN ARRANGED FOR US BY THE FIRE SHE SAID THERE IS A CHAIR FOR THE MARRIED LADY
1132-145024-0064 BUT THOSE TRIFLING WORDS WERE THE LAST OF HERS THAT I CAN REMEMBER FOR I RETAIN NO RECOLLECTION OF WHAT WAS SAID BY ANYONE IN THE CONVERSATION THAT ENSUED I WAS STRUCK BY THE ALTERATION IN HERSELF SHE WAS VERY PALE
1132-145024-0065 HER VOICE WAS WEAK AND LOW AND THERE WAS ABOUT HER A GENERAL APPEARANCE OF DEBILITY AND SUFFERING BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT SHE NEVER HAD MUCH ACUTE PAIN
1132-145024-0066 AND OUR VISIT TO THE SICK ROOM WAS A VERY SHORT ONE AUNT CASSANDRA SOON TAKING US AWAY I DO NOT SUPPOSE WE STAYED A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND I NEVER SAW AUNT JANE AGAIN
1132-145024-0067 IN MAY EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN SHE WAS PERSUADED TO REMOVE TO WINCHESTER FOR THE SAKE OF MEDICAL ADVICE FROM MISTER LYFORD THE LYFORDS HAVE FOR SOME GENERATIONS MAINTAINED A HIGH CHARACTER IN WINCHESTER FOR MEDICAL SKILL
1132-145024-0068 AND THE MISTER LYFORD OF THAT DAY WAS A MAN OF MORE THAN PROVINCIAL REPUTATION IN WHOM GREAT LONDON PRACTITIONERS EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE MISTER LYFORD SPOKE ENCOURAGINGLY IT WAS NOT OF COURSE HIS BUSINESS TO EXTINGUISH HOPE IN HIS PATIENT
1132-145024-0069 BUT I BELIEVE THAT HE HAD FROM THE FIRST VERY LITTLE EXPECTATION OF A PERMANENT CURE ALL THAT WAS GAINED BY THE REMOVAL FROM HOME WAS THE SATISFACTION OF HAVING DONE THE BEST THAT COULD BE DONE TOGETHER WITH SUCH ALLEVIATIONS OF SUFFERING
1132-145024-0070 AS SUPERIOR MEDICAL SKILL COULD AFFORD JANE AND HER SISTER CASSANDRA TOOK LODGINGS IN COLLEGE STREET THEY HAD TWO KIND FRIENDS LIVING IN THE CLOSE MISSUS HEATHCOTE AND MISS BIGG THE MOTHER AND AUNT OF THE PRESENT SIR WM HEATHCOTE OF HURSLEY
1132-145024-0071 BETWEEN WHOSE FAMILY AND OURS A CLOSE FRIENDSHIP HAS EXISTED FOR SEVERAL GENERATIONS THESE FRIENDS DID ALL THAT THEY COULD TO PROMOTE THE COMFORT OF THE SISTERS DURING THAT SAD SOJOURN IN WINCHESTER BOTH BY THEIR SOCIETY AND BY SUPPLYING THOSE LITTLE CONVENIENCES
1132-145024-0072 IN WHICH A LODGING HOUSE WAS LIKELY TO BE DEFICIENT IT WAS SHORTLY AFTER SETTLING IN THESE LODGINGS THAT SHE WROTE TO A NEPHEW THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTIC LETTER NO LONGER ALAS IN HER FORMER STRONG CLEAR HAND MISSUS DAVID'S
1132-145024-0073 WINTON TUESDAY MAY TWENTY SEVENTH THERE IS NO BETTER WAY MY DEAREST E OF THANKING YOU FOR YOUR AFFECTIONATE CONCERN FOR ME DURING MY ILLNESS THAN BY TELLING YOU MYSELF AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THAT I CONTINUE TO GET BETTER
1132-145024-0074 I WILL NOT BOAST OF MY HANDWRITING NEITHER THAT NOR MY FACE HAVE YET RECOVERED THEIR PROPER BEAUTY BUT IN OTHER RESPECTS I GAIN STRENGTH VERY FAST I AM NOW OUT OF BED FROM NINE IN THE MORNING TO TEN AT NIGHT
1132-145024-0075 BUT I EAT MY MEALS WITH AUNT CASSANDRA IN A RATIONAL WAY AND CAN EMPLOY MYSELF AND WALK FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER MISTER LYFORD SAYS HE WILL CURE ME AND IF HE FAILS I SHALL DRAW UP A MEMORIAL AND LAY IT BEFORE THE DEAN AND CHAPTER
1132-145024-0076 AND HAVE NO DOUBT OF REDRESS FROM THAT PIOUS LEARNED
1132-145024-0077 WAS PERFORMED WITH VERY LITTLE FATIGUE AND HAD IT BEEN A FINE DAY I THINK I SHOULD HAVE FELT NONE BUT IT DISTRESSED ME TO SEE UNCLE HENRY AND WM KNIGHT WHO KINDLY ATTENDED US ON HORSEBACK RIDING IN THE RAIN ALMOST THE WHOLE WAY
1132-145024-0078 WE EXPECT A VISIT FROM THEM TO MORROW AND HOPE THEY WILL STAY THE NIGHT AND ON THURSDAY WHICH IS A CONFIRMATION AND A HOLIDAY WE ARE TO GET CHARLES OUT TO BREAKFAST WE HAVE HAD BUT ONE VISIT FROM HIM POOR FELLOW
1132-145024-0079 AS HE IS IN SICK ROOM BUT HE HOPES TO BE OUT TO NIGHT
1132-145024-0080 AND WILLIAM IS TO CALL UPON US SOON GOD BLESS YOU MY DEAR E IF EVER YOU ARE ILL MAY YOU BE AS TENDERLY NURSED AS I HAVE BEEN MAY THE SAME BLESSED ALLEVIATIONS OF ANXIOUS SYMPATHISING FRIENDS BE YOURS
1132-145024-0081 WATCHFUL INDEFATIGABLE NURSE HAS NOT BEEN MADE ILL BY HER EXERTIONS AS TO WHAT I OWE HER AND THE ANXIOUS AFFECTION OF ALL MY BELOVED FAMILY ON THIS OCCASION I CAN ONLY CRY OVER IT AND PRAY GOD TO BLESS THEM MORE AND MORE
1132-145024-0082 BOTH WERE WITH HER WHEN SHE DIED TWO OF HER BROTHERS WHO WERE CLERGYMEN LIVED NEAR ENOUGH TO WINCHESTER TO BE IN FREQUENT ATTENDANCE AND TO ADMINISTER THE SERVICES SUITABLE FOR A CHRISTIAN'S DEATH BED WHILE SHE USED THE LANGUAGE OF HOPE TO HER CORRESPONDENTS
1132-145024-0083 THAT THERE WAS MUCH TO ATTACH HER TO LIFE SHE WAS HAPPY IN HER FAMILY SHE WAS JUST BEGINNING TO FEEL CONFIDENCE IN HER OWN SUCCESS AND NO DOUBT THE EXERCISE OF HER GREAT TALENTS WAS AN ENJOYMENT IN ITSELF
1132-145024-0084 WE MAY WELL BELIEVE THAT SHE WOULD GLADLY HAVE LIVED LONGER BUT SHE WAS ENABLED WITHOUT DISMAY OR COMPLAINT TO PREPARE FOR DEATH SHE WAS A HUMBLE BELIEVING CHRISTIAN HER LIFE HAD BEEN PASSED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HOME DUTIES
1132-145024-0085 AND THE CULTIVATION OF DOMESTIC AFFECTIONS WITHOUT ANY SELF SEEKING OR CRAVING AFTER APPLAUSE SHE HAD ALWAYS SOUGHT AS IT WERE BY INSTINCT TO PROMOTE THE HAPPINESS OF ALL WHO CAME WITHIN HER INFLUENCE AND DOUBTLESS SHE HAD HER REWARD
1132-145024-0086 IN THE PEACE OF MIND WHICH WAS GRANTED HER IN HER LAST DAYS HER SWEETNESS OF TEMPER NEVER FAILED SHE WAS EVER CONSIDERATE AND GRATEFUL TO THOSE WHO ATTENDED ON HER AT TIMES WHEN SHE FELT RATHER BETTER HER PLAYFULNESS OF SPIRIT REVIVED
1132-145024-0087 AND SHE AMUSED THEM EVEN IN THEIR SADNESS ONCE WHEN SHE THOUGHT HERSELF NEAR HER END SHE SAID WHAT SHE IMAGINED MIGHT BE HER LAST WORDS TO THOSE AROUND HER AND PARTICULARLY THANKED HER SISTER IN LAW FOR BEING WITH HER SAYING
1132-145024-0088 YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A KIND SISTER TO ME MARY WHEN THE END AT LAST CAME SHE SANK RAPIDLY AND ON BEING ASKED BY HER ATTENDANTS
1132-145024-0089 HER REPLY WAS NOTHING BUT DEATH THESE WERE HER LAST WORDS IN QUIETNESS AND PEACE
1132-145024-0090 EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN ON THE TWENTY FOURTH OF THAT MONTH SHE WAS BURIED IN WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL NEAR THE CENTRE OF THE NORTH AISLE ALMOST OPPOSITE TO THE BEAUTIFUL CHANTRY TOMB OF WILLIAM OF WYKEHAM
1132-145024-0091 A LARGE SLAB OF BLACK MARBLE IN THE PAVEMENT MARKS THE PLACE HER OWN FAMILY ONLY ATTENDED THE FUNERAL HER SISTER RETURNED TO HER DESOLATED HOME THERE TO DEVOTE HERSELF FOR TEN YEARS TO THE CARE OF HER AGED MOTHER AND TO LIVE MUCH
1132-145024-0092 ON THE MEMORY OF HER LOST SISTER TILL CALLED MANY YEARS LATER TO REJOIN HER HER BROTHERS WENT BACK SORROWING TO THEIR SEVERAL HOMES THEY WERE VERY FOND AND VERY PROUD OF HER THEY WERE ATTACHED TO HER BY HER TALENTS HER VIRTUES
1132-145024-0093 AND HER ENGAGING MANNERS AND EACH LOVED AFTERWARDS TO FANCY A RESEMBLANCE IN SOME NIECE OR DAUGHTER OF HIS OWN TO THE DEAR SISTER JANE WHOSE PERFECT EQUAL
