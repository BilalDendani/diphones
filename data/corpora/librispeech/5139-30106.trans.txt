5139-30106-0000 THE TWO GIRLS LISTENED TO LOUISE WITH EXPRESSIONS OF MINGLED WONDER AND AMUSEMENT WHILE SHE CONFIDED TO THEM HER FIRST SUSPICIONS THAT CAPTAIN WEGG HAD BEEN MURDERED
5139-30106-0001 AND THEN THE BITS OF INFORMATION SHE HAD GATHERED TO STRENGTHEN THE SURMISE AND ASSURE HER SHE WAS JUSTIFIED IN HER EFFORTS TO UNTANGLE THE WEB OF MYSTERY YOU SEE MY DEARS SHE EXPLAINED IMPRESSIVELY
5139-30106-0002 AS THE THREE LOUNGED UPON THE GRASS IN THE SHADE OF THE RIGHT WING OF THE HOUSE THERE IS A VERY INTERESTING STORY ABOUT THESE PEOPLE THAT OUGHT TO GUIDE US DIRECTLY TO A SOLUTION OF THE PUZZLE A ROVING SEA CAPTAIN MARRIES A GIRL OF GOOD FAMILY IN SPITE OF THE OPPOSITION OF HER RELATIVES
5139-30106-0003 HIS BOATSWAIN A CONFIDENTIAL SERVANT MARRIES THE GIRL'S MAID THE NEXT THING WE KNOW IS THAT A GREAT TROUBLE CAUSES THEM TO FLEE DOUBTLESS SOME CRIME COMMITTED BY THE CAPTAIN IT MAY HAVE BEEN ROBBERY
5139-30106-0004 HERE THE WEGGS MAKE NO FRIENDS BUT THE WIFE CRIES HER EYES OUT UNTIL SHE DIES MISERABLY LEAVING A SON TO THE TENDER MERCIES OF A WICKED FATHER SO FEARFUL IS HE OF DISCOVERY THAT HE WILL NOT ALLOW THE BOY TO GO TO SCHOOL BUT TRIES TO EDUCATE HIM HIMSELF
5139-30106-0005 MARK ME WELL GIRLS A NEMESIS WAS ON THE TRACK OF THIS WICKED SINNER AFTER MANY YEARS THE MAN CAPTAIN WEGG HAD WRONGED OR STOLEN FROM OR SOMETHING DISCOVERED HIS ENEMY'S HIDING PLACE HE PROMPTLY KILLED THE CAPTAIN AND PROBABLY RECOVERED THE MONEY FOR IT'S GONE
5139-30106-0006 OLD THOMPSON ETHEL'S GRANDFATHER HAPPENED TO BE PRESENT THE MURDERER ALSO TOOK HIS MONEY AND OH LOUISE THAT ISN'T REASONABLE OBJECTED BETH WHO HAD BEEN FOLLOWING THE STORY CAREFULLY WHY NOT
5139-30106-0007 BETH IS RIGHT SAID PATSY STOUTLY BUT OLD THOMPSON LOST HIS MONEY AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW AT LEAST HIS MONEY COULD NEVER BE FOUND AFTERWARD
5139-30106-0008 AND WHEN HE FOUND HIM HE DEMANDED A RESTITUTION OF HIS MONEY THREATENING TO SEND THE CRIMINAL TO JAIL THAT WOULD BE VERY NATURAL WOULDN'T IT WELL CAPTAIN WEGG HAD SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF THE MONEY AND COULDN'T PAY IT ALL BACK SO ETHEL'S GRANDFATHER BEING HIS FRIEND
5139-30106-0009 OFFERED TO MAKEUP THE BALANCE HIMSELF RATHER THAN SEE HIS FRIEND GO TO PRISON THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ALL THE MONEY IF THAT IS SO OBSERVED PATSY I DON'T SEE WHY THE MAN HAVING GOT HIS MONEY BACK SHOULD MURDER ONE AND KNOCK THE OTHER ON THE HEAD
5139-30106-0010 IS THAT AFTER THE MONEY WAS PAID OVER THEY GOT INTO A QUARREL THEN THE AVENGER LOST HIS TEMPER AND COMMITTED THE MURDERS THIS TALK ABOUT AN AVENGER IS ALL GUESS WORK ASSERTED BETH CALMLY I DON'T BELIEVE THE FACTS POINT TO AN AVENGER AT ALL BUT THE OLD CRIME
5139-30106-0011 THE GREAT TROUBLE OH WE'LL ALLOW ALL THAT RETURNED BETH AND I DON'T SAY THAT AN AVENGER WOULDN'T BE THE NICEST PERSON TO EXACT RETRIBUTION FROM THE WICKED CAPTAIN BUT AVENGERS DON'T ALWAYS TURN UP IN REAL LIFE WHEN THEY OUGHT TO GIRLS
5139-30106-0012 SO WE MUSTN'T BE TOO SURE THAT ONE TURNED UP IN THIS CASE
5139-30106-0013 WELL SOME ONE ELSE MIGHT KNOW HE HAD MONEY AND THAT ETHEL'S GRANDFATHER HAD MONEY TOO WAS THE REPLY SUPPOSE THE ROBBERY AND MURDER HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OLD CRIME AT ALL BUT THAT THE MURDERER KNEW THIS TO BE A DESERTED PLACE WHERE HE COULD MAKE A GOOD HAUL WITHOUT BEING DISCOVERED
5139-30106-0014 LOUISE REFLECTED A MOMENT THIS COUNTRY IS ALMOST A WILDERNESS SHE MUSED ALOUD AND FEW STRANGERS EVER COME HERE BESIDES A STRANGER WOULD NOT KNOW POSITIVELY THAT THESE TWO MEN HAD MONEY
5139-30106-0015 IF WE ABANDON THE IDEA OF AN AVENGER AND FOLLOW BETH'S CLUE THEN THE MURDERER IS STILL RIGHT HERE IN MILLVILLE AND UNSUSPECTED BY ANY OF HIS NEIGHBORS OH LOUISE WITH STARTLED GLANCES OVER THEIR SHOULDERS
5139-30106-0016 I FEEL THAT SOME ANGEL OF RETRIBUTION HAS GUIDED US TO THIS LONELY FARMHOUSE AND PUT THE IDEA INTO MY HEAD TO DISCOVER AND EXPOSE A DREADFUL CRIME SUCCOTASH CRIED PATSY IRRELEVANTLY YOU'RE ROMANCING THIS MINUTE LOUISE
5139-30106-0017 THE WAY YOU FIGURE THINGS OUT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU ACCUSED ME OR UNCLE JOHN ANY TIME DURING THE NEXT HALF HOUR ADOPTING YOUR LAST SUPPOSITION FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT I'M INTERESTED TO KNOW WHAT INHABITANT OF SLEEPY OLD MILLVILLE YOU SUSPECT
5139-30106-0018 DON'T GET FLIGHTY PATRICIA ADMONISHED BETH THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER AND LOUISE IS IN EARNEST IF WE'RE GOING TO HELP HER WE MUSTN'T TALK RUBBISH NOW IT ISN'T A BAD SUGGESTION THAT WE OUGHT TO LOOK NEARER HOME FOR THE KEY TO THIS MYSTERY THERE'S OLD HUCKS
5139-30106-0019 HUCKS TO BE SURE NO ONE KNEW SO WELL AS HE THE MONEY AFFAIRS OF THE TWO MEN WHO WERE ROBBED I'M ASHAMED OF YOU SAID PATSY AND THE MAN'S SMILE IS A MASK EXCLAIMED LOUISE OH NO PROTESTED PATSY
5139-30106-0020 BUT HE'S POOR URGED PATSY IN DEFENSE OF THE OLD MAN HE HASN'T A PENNY IN THE WORLD
5139-30106-0021 THEY'D HAVE TO GO TO THE POORHOUSE THAT IS NO ARGUMENT AT ALL SAID LOUISE CALMLY IF WE CONSIDER THE FACT THAT OLD HUCKS MAY BE A MISER AND HAVE A CRAVING FOR MONEY WITHOUT ANY DESIRE TO SPEND IT
5139-30106-0022 THEN WE ARE PRETTY CLOSE TO A REASON WHY HE SHOULD BIDE HIS TIME AND THEN MURDER HIS OLD MASTER TO OBTAIN THE RICHES HE COVETED MIND YOU I DON'T SAY HUCKS IS GUILTY BUT IT IS OUR DUTY TO CONSIDER THIS PHASE OF THE QUESTION
5139-30106-0023 IF YOU ALLOW YOUR PERSONAL FEELINGS TO INFLUENCE YOU RETURNED LOUISE I TOO SINCERELY HOPE THAT THOMAS IS INNOCENT BUT WE ARE NOT JUSTIFIED IN ACQUITTING HIM UNTIL WE HAVE MADE A CAREFUL INVESTIGATION AND WATCHED HIS ACTIONS
5139-30106-0024 I'M QUITE SURE HE'S CONNECTED WITH THE MYSTERY IN SOME WAY SAID BETH IT WILL DO NO HARM TO WATCH OLD HUCKS AS LOUISE SUGGESTS AND YOU MIGHT TRY TO PUMP HIM PATSY AND SEE IF YOU CAN GET HIM TO TALK OF THE MURDER
5139-30106-0025 THOMAS AND I ARE GOOD FRIENDS AND I'D FEEL LIKE A TRAITOR TO TRY TO GET HIM TO CONFESS A MURDER IF HE IS INNOCENT YOU HAVE DONE NO HARM SAID HER ELDEST COUSIN AND IF HE IS GUILTY YOU DON'T WANT HIM FOR YOUR FRIEND
5139-30106-0026 HE LIKES YOU DEAR ADDED BETH AND PERHAPS HE WILL TELL YOU FRANKLY ALL WE WANT TO KNOW THERE'S ANOTHER PERSON THOUGH LOUISE WHO MIGHT TELL US SOMETHING WHO IS THAT THE LITTLE MAN WITH THE GOLF BALL EYES MC NUTT
5139-30106-0027 NOW THERE'S SOME SENSE IN SUSPECTING HIM EXCLAIMED PATSY WE KNOW HE'S A ROBBER ALREADY AND A MAN WHO IS CLEVER ENOUGH TO SELL UNCLE JOHN THREE LIVES OF THE SAINTS WOULD STICK AT NOTHING I'M SURE HE HASN'T ENOUGH COURAGE TO COMMIT A GREAT CRIME OBSERVED BETH
5139-30106-0028 HOW MUCH ARE YOU ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE UNCLE JOHN HAD ASKED NOTHING TALL SIR SINCE CAP'N WEGG DIED WAS THE REPLY WE WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO HAVE A HOME NORA AN ME THOUT SPECTIN WAGES AND THERE WAS NO ONE HERE FOR YOU TO SERVE MUSED UNCLE JOHN
5139-30106-0029 BUT IN CAPTAIN WEGG'S DAY HOW MUCH DID HE GIVE YOU
5139-30106-0030 AN I AST HIM FER LITTLE MONEY BECAUSE MY NEEDS WERE LITTLE WELL THE CONDITIONS ARE NOW DIFFERENT REMARKED UNCLE JOHN CARELESSLY AND WHILE YOU ARE IN MY EMPLOY YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR WAGES REGULARLY WILL TEN DOLLARS A WEEK BE SATISFACTORY OH SIR
5139-30106-0031 AND FIVE FOR NORA YOU ARE TOO GOOD SIR I I NEVER MIND THOMAS IF YOU WANT MORE AT ANY TIME LET ME KNOW IT WAS THEN AS THE OLD MAN TOOK THE FIFTEEN DOLLARS EXTENDED TO HIM THAT BETH NOTED A FLASH IN THE MILD BLUE EYES
5139-30106-0032 AND A TREMBLING OF THE HORNY HANDS HUCKS WAS VERY GLAD TO GET THE MONEY THERE WAS LITTLE DOUBT OF THAT SHE SPOKE OF THIS INCIDENT TO LOUISE AND THE FOLLOWING MORNING THEY TESTED THE MAN AGAIN
5139-30106-0033 ALL THREE GIRLS BEING PRESENT BETH TENDERED OLD HUCKS TWO DOLLARS SAYING IT WAS INTENDED AS A SLIGHT MARK OF HER APPRECIATION OF HIS ATTENTION THOMAS DEMURRED AT FIRST BUT ON BEING URGED TOOK THE MONEY WITH THE SAME EAGER GESTURE HE HAD BEFORE DISPLAYED
5139-30106-0034 THIS GENEROSITY SO AMAZED HIM THAT TEARS STOOD IN HIS EYES AS HE TRIED TO THANK THEM ALL
5139-30106-0035 HE CONCEALED THE OFFERINGS WITH A STEALTHY MOTION AS IF ASHAMED OF HIS WEAKNESS IN ACCEPTING THEM AND THEN HURRIED AWAY TO HIS WORK WELL SAID LOUISE WHEN THEY WERE ALONE IS THOMAS A MISER OR NOT
5139-30106-0036 HE CLUTCHED THE MONEY ALMOST AS IF HE LOVED IT OBSERVED BETH IN A MUSING AND SLIGHTLY REGRETFUL TONE BUT THINK HOW POOR HE HAS BEEN PLEADED PATSY AND HOW DESTITUTE BOTH HE AND NORA ARE YET CAN WE BLAME HIM FOR BEING GLAD TO EARN SOMETHING SUBSTANTIAL AT LAST
5139-30106-0037 SOMEHOW THAT DID NOT SEEM TO EXPLAIN FULLY THE OLD MAN'S BEHAVIOR AND THE GIRL WHO HAD CHAMPIONED HIM SIGHED AND THEN GAVE A SUDDEN SHIVER AS SHE REMEMBERED THE AWFUL SUSPICION THAT HAD FALLEN UPON THIS STRANGE INDIVIDUAL IF THE PROOF MUST BE ACCEPTED THAT HUCKS HAD MISERLY INSTINCTS
