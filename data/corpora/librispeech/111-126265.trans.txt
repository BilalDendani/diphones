111-126265-0000 BUT THE OCEAN WITH ITS CEASELESS MOTION ITS WONDERFUL RISING AND FALLING OF THE TIDES AND ITS CONSTANT AND MYSTERIOUS MOANING IS NOT TO BE OUTDONE IN SUBLIMITY AND OFFERS A KEEN DELIGHT
111-126265-0001 TO THE LOVER OF NATURE ITS SANDS AND WATERS ARE EVER CHANGING ITS RUGGED COAST WITH ROCKS SCATTERED IN WILD PROFUSION IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING SPOTS IN ALL THE WORLD
111-126265-0002 A PIECE OF WRECKAGE IS THROWN UPON THE BEACH AND YOU WONDER WHAT DIRE DISASTER HAPPENED FAR OUT AT SEA AND IF THE REST OF THE SHIP WENT TO THE BOTTOM WITH ALL ON BOARD
111-126265-0003 BUT TAKE IT HOME LET IT DRY IN THE SUN THEN PLACE IT ON YOUR OPEN GRATE FIRE AND AS YOU WATCH THE IRIDESCENT BLAZE CURL UP THE CHIMNEY DREAM DREAMS AND WEAVE STRANGE FANCIES
111-126265-0004 IN THE LIGHT OF YOUR DRIFTWOOD FIRE A DAY AT THE SEASHORE IS ONE OF PLEASURE A DELIGHTFUL CHANGE FROM WOODS AND UPLANDS TO ROCKS AND RUSHING WATERS
111-126265-0005 SOME PREFER THE SMOOTH STRETCH OF SANDY BEACH WHERE ONE MAY LIE AT LUXURIOUS EASE IN THE WARM SAND AND LISTEN TO THE WAVES LAPPING ALONG SHORE OR DISCARDING SHOES AND STOCKINGS
111-126265-0006 WADE OUT UNTIL THE WHITE CAPPED WAVES LIKE POLICEMEN DRIVE YOU BACK FROM ENCROACHING UPON OLD NEPTUNE'S DOMAIN BUT WE PREFER THE ROCKY CLIFFS COMBINED WITH THE SANDY BEACH
111-126265-0007 AND SUCH A PLACE IS LAND'S END NEAR THE GOLDEN GATE IN SAN FRANCISCO WE STARTED DOWN THE STEEP INCLINE STREWN WITH JAGGED ROCKS
111-126265-0008 TO FOLLOW THE NARROW PATH ALONG THE CLIFFS BUT OUR OUTING WAS MARRED BY MEETING TWO MEN TOILING UP THE PATH ALONG THE NARROW WAY CARRYING AN UNFORTUNATE SIGHTSEER WHO HAD VENTURED TOO NEAR THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF
111-126265-0009 AND FALLEN INTO THE OCEAN ONLY THE PROMPT ACTION OF A FRIEND WHO SCRAMBLED DOWN THE ROCKS AT THE RISK OF HIS LIFE SAVED HIM
111-126265-0010 JUDGING BY HIS AGONIZING GROANS BUT THE AMBULANCE OFFICERS HAD BEEN SUMMONED AND THE UNFORTUNATE SUFFERER WAS CARED FOR AT THE HOSPITAL THE INCIDENT SERVED TO MAKE US MORE CAREFUL AND AT THE NARROWEST PLACE
111-126265-0011 FOR THE ROCKS BELOW ROSE UP LIKE DRAGON'S TEETH READY TO IMPALE US IF WE SHOULD MAKE A FALSE STEP
111-126265-0012 HAUNTED US LIKE A SPECTER THE PATH ALONG THE OCEAN IS A NARROW AND TORTUOUS ONE RUNNING ABOUT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE WATER AND THE TOP OF THE CLIFF GREAT GRANITE ROCKS RISE UP LIKE GIANTS
111-126265-0013 IS A DEEP DARK CAVERN EVIDENTLY WORN BY THE ACTION OF THE WAVES THAT HAVE POUNDED AGAINST IT FOR CENTURIES LOOKING OUT UPON THE OCEAN WE SEE A WAVE MIGHTIER THAN ALL THE OTHERS
111-126265-0014 SWEEPING ONWARD AS IF CHALLENGING THE ROCKS TO MORTAL COMBAT ITS MIGHTY CURVING CREST WHITE AND SEETHING WITH FOAM
111-126265-0015 BUT FORTUNE FAVORED US AND THE MUCH DESIRED PICTURE WAS SECURED BUT THUS WILL MEN GAMBLE WITH DEATH TO GRATIFY A WHIM FOR A FALSE STEP OR SUDDEN VERTIGO
111-126265-0016 WOULD HAVE SENT US CRASHING ON TO THE JAGGED ROCKS BELOW OVERHEAD THE SEA GULLS BEAT THE AIR ON TIRELESS WINGS OR SKIM CLOSE TO THE WATER INTENT UPON THEIR CEASELESS SEARCH FOR FOOD
111-126265-0017 FAR OUT THE LIGHTHOUSE STANDS ANCHORED TO THE ROCKS THE WAVES DASHING AGAINST IT AS IF TO TEAR IT FROM ITS FIRM FOUNDATION BUT IT DEFIES THEM ALL AND SENDS THE CHEERY BEACON LIGHT
111-126265-0018 TO GUIDE THE STATELY SHIPS BETWEEN THE PORTALS OF THE GOLDEN GATE DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE WHITE BUILDINGS OF POINT BONITA
111-126265-0019 STAND OUT AGAINST THE GREEN OF THE HILLS STRONGLY FORTIFIED AND READY AT ALL TIMES
111-126265-0020 AGAINST WARLIKE INTRUDERS TWO HARDY FISHERMEN HAVE VENTURED OUT AT LOW TIDE TO A LARGE ROCK AND ARE CASTING THEIR LINES INTO THE BOILING WATERS FOR ROCK COD OR PORGIES
111-126265-0021 WHILE THE ITALIAN FISHING BOATS WITH THEIR QUEER STRIPED SAILS FORM A STRIKING CONTRAST TO THE MASSIVE STEAMBOATS WITH SMOKE TRAILING FROM THEIR TWIN FUNNELS THAT ARE OUTWARD BOUND FOR CHINA OR JAPAN
111-126265-0022 FARTHER ON WHERE THE ROCKS DESCEND TO THE SEA LEVEL WE ROAM THE BEACH AND GATHER SEA SHELLS STARFISH AND SEA URCHINS AND BY A SHALLOW POOL WE STOP TO WATCH THE SCARLET
111-126265-0023 WAVING BACK AND FORTH WITH THE ACTION OF THE TIDE BARNACLES COVER THE TOP OF EVERY ROCK THAT THE TIDE REACHES AND THE LONG BLACKISH SNAKELIKE SEAWEED IS STREWN ALONG THE BEACH
111-126265-0024 WE WATCH THE TIDE COME CREEPING IN EACH SUCCEEDING WAVE RUNNING A LITTLE FARTHER UP THE BEACH AND DRIVING US BACK WITH RELENTLESS ENERGY FROM ITS RIGHTFUL POSSESSIONS
111-126265-0025 THE SUN SINKS DOWN IN GOLDEN SPLENDOR BEHIND THE OCEAN'S RIM LEAVING A TRACK OF MOLTEN GOLD THAT TIPS
111-126265-0026 WE TURN OUR FACES HOMEWARD
