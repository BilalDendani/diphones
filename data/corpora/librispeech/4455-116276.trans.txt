4455-116276-0000 MONA WAS SITUATED ON A PLATEAU TERMINATING RATHER ABRUPTLY AT THE RIVER ON THE WEST AND ELEVATED WELL ABOVE ITS WATERS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE STATION IT WAS HIGH AND A LONG CLIMB A MILE FARTHER DOWN STREAM
4455-116276-0001 WHERE THE MANSION SAT ON THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF THE ELEVATION WAS NOT SO GREAT PERHAPS A HUNDRED FEET OR MORE ABOVE THE RAILROAD TRACKS BY THE RIVER THE MANSION END OF THE PLATEAU WAS LOWER THEREFORE THAN THE TOWN
4455-116276-0002 THE LAND LAY AT THE SAME ELEVATION AS MONA THE BEAUTIFUL PLACE ITSELF WAS SOME DISTANCE BACK FROM THE CREST OF THE PLATEAU AND WAS APPROACHED FROM THE RIVER BY THE HIGHWAY WE HAD KNOWN SO WELL THAT DAY THIS WAS INTERSECTED AT RIGHT ANGLES ON THE PLAIN ABOVE
4455-116276-0003 BY RIVER ROAD WHICH RAN PARALLEL TO THE WATERS BELOW THE JUNCTION OF THESE TWO ROADS WAS KNOWN AS THE CORNERS UPON FOLLOWING RIVER ROAD FOR NEARLY A MILE TOWARD THE SOUTH ONE WOULD ARRIVE AT THE MANSION GATE
4455-116276-0004 NEVER WAS PLACE MORE HOPEFUL UNTIL RECENTLY WHEN THE BLACKNESS AND GLOOM OF THE UNOCCUPIED MANSION WITH ITS TALE OF DREAD SEEMED TO HAVE EXTENDED TO MEN'S MINDS AND LAID ITS GRASP OF UNCANNINESS AND UNEASINESS ON BUSINESS AND PLEASURE
4455-116276-0005 AND NOW TO MAKE THE SLOUGH OF DESPOND DEEPER HAD COME THE SHARP QUICK ACT OF A MURDERER ABOVE ALL AN UNKNOWN ASSASSIN AND A CRIME SIMILAR TO ONE SCARCE FORGOTTEN THE MANSION GATE OPENED DIRECTLY FROM RIVER ROAD
4455-116276-0006 AND A WALK OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS BROUGHT THE VISITOR TO THE FRONT DOOR THE BACK OF THE MANSION FACED THE RIVER DIRECTLY TO THE WEST THE BALCONY OF THE BACK PARLOR AND DINING ROOM HALF CIRCLED THE SOUTH AND WEST SIDES OF THE HOUSE AND HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN MUCH USED
4455-116276-0007 THE WOODWORK WAS OLD AND THE FLOORING QUITE WORN THE FRONT OF THE PLACE WAS PILLARED IN OLD COLONIAL STYLE AND WAS OF STONE HEWN IN THE ROUGH AND BUILT IN A PERMANENT FASHION ACROSS RIVER ROAD RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE GATE
4455-116276-0008 TO A LITTLE POND OF CONSIDERABLE DEPTH AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DEPRESSION ON THE FARTHER SIDE THE GROUND ROSE MORE ABRUPTLY BUT NOT SO HIGH AS ON THE MANSION SIDE THE POND ITSELF WAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FEET IN WIDTH AND ONE STANDING BY THE MANSION EXIT
4455-116276-0009 COULD SEE BOTH THE POND AND THE ASCENT BEYOND AND OVER THE CREST OF THE BILLOWY GROUND THE DISTANT WOODS AND THE COUNTRY TO THE EAST
4455-116276-0010 AND AT ITS FOOT A FRAIL BRIDGE CROSSED THE POND FOR HERE THE TWO SHORES WERE QUITE CLOSE EITHER SHORE PROJECTED INTO A POINT AND ABOUT FIFTY FEET OF BRIDGE HAD BEEN BUILT WITH LOGS RESTING HALF WAY ON A RUDE PILLAR OF STONES IN THE WATER
4455-116276-0011 THIS BRIDGE CONTINUED THE PATH UP THE FAR SLOPE AND OVER THE CREST BEYOND IT WAS A SHORT CUT TO THE COUNTRY AND THE SOUTHERN SUBURB OF MONA WITHIN THE GROUNDS OF THE MANSION EXTENDING NORTHWARD TO THE HIGHWAY AND THE SCENE OF THE MURDER
4455-116276-0012 AND SOUTHWARD INTO THE UNINHABITED COUNTRY WAS A FOREST OF OAK AND OF ELM INTERSPERSED WITH AN OCCASIONAL FIR ONE COULD EASILY WANDER BETWEEN THE TRUNKS OF THESE TREES BUT HAVING ENTERED A FEW RODS
4455-116276-0013 IT AFFORDED AN EXCELLENT SHELTER FOR ANYONE DESIRING TO ESCAPE DETECTION
4455-116276-0014 WE FOUND THE CARE TAKERS AWAITING US AND MORE THAN GLAD TO AGAIN SEE MISTER CLARK AS THEY KNEW OAKES THE EVENTS OF THE DAY BEFORE HAD CROWDED FAST UPON US AND HAD LEFT US WELL KNOWN IN THE TOWN THE NAME OF CLARK WAS ON EVERY TONGUE
4455-116276-0015 OAKES REMARKED THAT MORNING BEFORE WE STARTED FOR THE MANSION THAT HE HOPED THE PEOPLE WOULD NOT IDENTIFY HIM IF THEY DO WE CANNOT HELP IT HOWEVER HE SAID WE CANNOT CONTROL EVENTS LIKE THESE THEN HE SUDDENLY ASKED ME HOW ABOUT THAT NEGRO
4455-116276-0016 HE WAS HANDSOME YOU SAY YES RATHER BLACK WITH REMARKABLY CLEAR CUT FEATURES INDEED THEN HE MAY BE TRACED THROUGH HIS GOOD LOOKS DO YOU THINK HE IS THE MURDERER
4455-116276-0017 HAD THE DEED BEEN DONE BY A NEGRO BOY THE VICTIM WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED IT THEY ARE UNCOMMON HERE HE WOULD HAVE SAID A NEGRO GOOD LOOKING OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT HIS COLOR WOULD HAVE IMPRESSED THE DYING MAN
4455-116276-0018 THE RACE IS VERY SUPERSTITIOUS IF I MAKE NO MISTAKE CONTINUED OAKES MONA IS GOING TO SEE QUEER DOINGS THE PEOPLE'S MINDS ARE AT A GREAT TENSION
4455-116276-0019 AND THE STAIRS LEADING TO THE UPPER FLOOR WAS BROAD AND WELL CARPETED OUR ROOMS TWO IN NUMBER WERE OVER THE PARLOR AND THE DINING ROOM THE LATTER THE SCENE OF THE OCCURRENCES SO FREQUENTLY DESCRIBED OAKES WAS GIVEN THE BACK ROOM LOOKING ON THE RIVER AND OVER THE BALCONY
4455-116276-0020 MOORE AND I OCCUPIED THE FRONT ROOM OVER THE PARLOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HALL WERE TWO LARGE ROOMS
4455-116276-0021 THEY FORMED THE ROOF OF THE DANCE OR RECEPTION HALL BELOW TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR AS WE ENTERED AND ALWAYS KEPT LOCKED AS ANNIE TOLD US IN FACT THE DANCE HALL AND THE TWO LARGE CHAMBERS OVERHEAD
4455-116276-0022 FORMED THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND HAD NOT BEEN USED FOR MANY YEARS ACCORDING TO TRADITION THE HALL HAD BEEN A GAY CENTRE IN THE YEARS GONE BY WHEN THE MANSION WAS THE LEADING HOUSE IN THE VILLAGE IT HAD NOW LOST ITS PRESTIGE
4455-116276-0023 TO NEW AND MAGNIFICENT RESIDENCES OF THE RICH NEW YORK MEN OF AFFAIRS WHO HAD RECENTLY COME INTO THE TOWN TO MAKE IT THEIR HOME AND TO TRANSFORM ALL ITS SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND TO ADD LIFE AND NEW ENERGY TO THE COUNTRY AROUND
4455-116276-0024 DURING THE FORENOON WE EXAMINED THE DOWNSTAIRS ROOMS PRETTY THOROUGHLY WE DID IT IN AN UNOSTENTATIOUS MANNER THE ROOMS HAD SEVERAL WINDOWS AND THE FRONT ONE FACING THE ROAD IN THE DISTANCE HAD A LARGE FIREPLACE
4455-116276-0025 OAKES EXAMINED THIS CAREFULLY AND SHOOK HIS HEAD IN A NEGATIVE MANNER THE BACK ROOM FACING THE RIVER ON THE WEST THE LAWN AND THE ESTATE ON THE SOUTH WAS THE DINING ROOM ITS FOUR LARGE WINDOWS TWO ON EACH SIDE
4455-116276-0026 EXTENDED DOWN IN THE OLD STYLE TO WITHIN A FOOT OF THE ENCIRCLING PORCH AGAIN THERE WAS A LARGE FIREPLACE AND I LOOKED OVER IT CLOSELY BUT IT WAS SOLIDLY BUILT AND SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN UNDISTURBED FOR YEARS
4455-116276-0027 I WAS NEAR THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM LEANING UPON THE TABLE AND MOORE WAS FARTHER ALONG ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE NEAR THE EASTERN WALL WE WERE QUITE INTERESTED IN THE PLACE AND I AM SURE I FELT ANYTHING BUT SECURE
4455-116276-0028 DOCTOR MOORE LAUGHED IN HIS CARELESS WAY LOOK OUT OLD FELLOW SAID HE IT WILL CATCH YOU AGAIN OAKES AND I STEPPED OUT ON THE BALCONY THROUGH THE LOW SILLED WINDOW AND LOOKED ACROSS THE RIVER I HEARD A RUSTLE I THOUGHT A HALF MUFFLED TREAD
4455-116276-0029 A SWISH A PECULIAR NOISE AND OAKES JUMPED TO THE CENTRE OF THE BALCONY LOOK OUT THAT'S THE NOISE CRIED THE DETECTIVE WE BOTH GLANCED TOWARD MOORE AND SAW A TERRIBLE SIGHT THE STRONG MAN WAS UNSTEADY ON HIS FEET HIS KNEES WERE BENT AND HIS HEAD THROWN FORWARD
4455-116276-0030 GREAT DROPS OF PERSPIRATION WERE ROLLING OFF HIS PALE FACE HE LOOKED LIKE A MAN ABOUT TO FALL HELP FOR GOD'S SAKE HELP HE CRIED AND CLUTCHED AT HIS NECK THAT INSTANT THE PHYSICIAN CAME ACROSS THE ROOM HURLED BY TERRIFIC FORCE I CAUGHT HIM AS HE FELL
4455-116276-0031 PRECEDED BY A SLAM AT THAT INSTANT OUR ATTENTION WAS CALLED TO THE BALCONY A FIGURE JUMPED ON THE PORCH FROM THE WEST SIDE AND DASHED PAST THE WINDOWS LEAVING THE BALCONY NEAR ITS SOUTHERN END AND DISAPPEARING IN THE TREES BEYOND
4455-116276-0032 A MAN SAID OAKES AND HE WAS HIDING BEHIND THE PORCH YES BUT HE DID NOT DO IT HOW COULD HE HAVE RUN THERE SO QUICKLY I ANSWERED BETTER TAKE MOORE UPSTAIRS
4455-116276-0033 HE SPRANG TO THE WEST END OF THE HALL NEAR THE DINING ROOM AND OPENED A DOOR I HAD NOT NOTICED WHERE ARE YOU GOING SAID I INTO THE CELLAR DON'T FOLLOW UNLESS I SHOOT HE WAS GONE
4455-116276-0034 AS I WORKED HE HELD HIS REVOLVER IN HIS HAND AND WATCHED THE DOOR TALKING QUICKLY AND EARNESTLY HE TOLD ME ABOUT HOW HE HAD WONDERED IF OAKES WERE INSANE THEN OF THE ASSAULT ON HIMSELF HOW HE HAD HEARD THE NOISE AND HAD CERTAINLY BEEN ATTACKED BY SOME LIVING BEING
4455-116276-0035 AND WAS SATISFIED THAT HIS SUSPICIONS COULD NOT BE CORRECT HE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY CONVERTED ALL THIS TOOK SOME TIME AND NOW WE WERE WONDERING WHAT HAD BECOME OF OUR FRIEND THE MINUTES PASSED AND I DECIDED TO DESCEND AND SEE WHAT THE SERVANTS WERE DOING AND RAISE AN ALARM
4455-116276-0036 JUST AS I WAS SETTING OFF WE HEARD TWO PISTOL CRACKS MUFFLED BUT THE NOISE FROM CARTRIDGES SUCH AS WE CARRIED NEVERTHELESS I GRASPED MY WEAPON AND STARTED DOWNSTAIRS AS I REACHED THE TOP OF THE LANDING I HEARD THE CELLAR DOOR CLOSE WITH A BANG ON THE FLOOR BELOW
4455-116276-0037 AND HEARD A SLOW TREAD ASCENDING THE STAIRS I RETREATED SO AS TO AID MY WOUNDED COMPANION THE TREAD ADVANCED ALONG THE HALL IT WAS THAT OF A MAN LIMPING THE NEXT INSTANT WE RECOGNIZED OAKES'S VOICE WHERE ARE YOU ANYWAY
4455-116276-0038 AND HIS FIGURE LESS ERECT LESS SELF RELIANT THAN USUAL HE WAS BLOODY FROM A WOUND ON HIS HEAD AND HIS CLOTHES WERE TORN IN SHREDS HE STEADIED HIMSELF WITH HIS LEFT HAND AGAINST THE DOOR FRAME
4455-116276-0039 WHAT THE DEVIL I EXCLAIMED WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE CELLAR SAID OAKES
4455-116276-0040 BACK CAME THE ANSWER IN A FEEBLE TONE REALLY I DON'T KNOW HAVING A LITTLE PRACTICE I GUESS
