8058-99403-0000 THEY WERE ALL IN A RIGHT FRAME OF MIND SO I GAVE THEM WHAT STORES I COULD SPARE AND PUT THEM ON BOARD A SHIP THAT WE MET WITH ON HER WAY TO FRANCE ALL SAVE FIVE WHO WITH THE PRIEST HAD A WISH TO JOIN ME
8058-99403-0001 BUT WE HAD NOT SET SAIL LONG WHEN WE FELL IN WITH A SHIP THAT HAD BEEN BLOWN OUT TO SEA BY A STORM AND HAD LOST HER MASTS AND WORSE THAN ALL HER CREW HAD NOT HAD AN OUNCE OF MEAT OR BREAD FOR TEN DAYS
8058-99403-0002 I GAVE THEM ALL SOME FOOD WHICH THEY ATE LIKE WOLVES IN THE SNOW BUT I THOUGHT IT BEST TO CHECK THEM AS I HAD FEARS THAT SO MUCH ALL AT ONCE WOULD CAUSE THE DEATH OF SOME OF THEM
8058-99403-0003 THERE WERE A YOUTH AND A YOUNG GIRL IN THE SHIP WHO THE MATE SAID HE THOUGHT MUST BE DEAD BUT HE HAD NOT HAD THE HEART TO GO NEAR THEM FOR THE FOOD WAS ALL GONE
8058-99403-0004 I FOUND THAT THEY WERE FAINT FOR THE WANT OF IT AND AS IT WERE IN THE JAWS OF DEATH BUT IN A SHORT TIME THEY BOTH GOT WELL AND AS THEY HAD NO WISH TO GO BACK TO THEIR SHIP I TOOK THEM WITH ME
8058-99403-0005 SO NOW I HAD EIGHT MORE ON BOARD MY SHIP THAN I HAD WHEN I FIRST SET OUT IN THREE MONTHS FROM THE TIME WHEN I LEFT HOME I CAME IN SIGHT OF MY ISLE AND I BROUGHT THE SHIP SAFE UP
8058-99403-0006 BY THE SIDE OF THE CREEK WHICH WAS NEAR MY OLD HOUSE I WENT UP TO FRIDAY TO ASK IF HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS HE TOOK A LOOK ROUND HIM AND SOON WITH A CLAP OF THE HANDS SAID O YES O THERE O YES O THERE
8058-99403-0007 BYE AND BYE HE SET UP A DANCE WITH SUCH WILD GLEE THAT IT WAS AS MUCH AS I COULD DO TO KEEP HIM ON DECK WELL WHAT THINK YOU FRIDAY SAID I SHALL WE FIND THOSE WHOM WE LEFT STILL HERE
8058-99403-0008 SHALL WE SEE POOR OLD JAF HE STOOD QUITE MUTE FOR A WHILE BUT WHEN I SPOKE OF OLD JAF WHOSE SON FRIDAY WAS THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS FACE AND THE POOR SOUL WAS AS SAD AS COULD BE
8058-99403-0009 NO NO SAID HE NO MORE NO NO MORE AS WE CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOME MEN AT THE TOP OF THE HILL I GAVE WORD TO FIRE THREE GUNS TO SHOW THAT WE WERE FRIENDS
8058-99403-0010 AND SOON WE SAW SMOKE RISE FROM THE SIDE OF THE CREEK I THEN WENT ON SHORE IN A BOAT WITH THE PRIEST AND FRIDAY AND HUNG OUT A WHITE FLAG OF PEACE THE FIRST MAN I CAST MY EYES ON AT THE CREEK WAS MY OLD FRIEND CARL
8058-99403-0011 WHO WHEN I WAS LAST ON THE ISLE HAD BEEN BROUGHT HERE IN BONDS I GAVE STRICT CHARGE TO THE MEN IN THE BOAT NOT TO GO ON SHORE BUT FRIDAY COULD NOT BE KEPT BACK
8058-99403-0012 FOR WITH HIS QUICK EYE HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF OLD JAF IT BROUGHT THE TEARS TO OUR EYES TO SEE HIS JOY WHEN HE MET THE OLD MAN HE GAVE HIM A KISS TOOK HIM UP IN HIS ARMS SET HIM DOWN IN THE SHADE THEN STOOD A SHORT WAY OFF TO LOOK AT HIM
8058-99403-0013 AS ONE WOULD LOOK AT A WORK OF ART THEN FELT HIM WITH HIS HAND AND ALL THIS TIME HE WAS IN FULL TALK AND TOLD HIM ONE BY ONE ALL THE STRANGE TALES OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN SINCE THEY HAD LAST MET
8058-99403-0014 HE CAME UP TO ME AND WITH MUCH WARMTH SHOOK MY HANDS AND THEN TOOK ME TO MY OLD HOUSE WHICH HE NOW GAVE UP TO ME I COULD NO MORE HAVE FOUND THE PLACE THAN IF I HAD NOT BEEN THERE AT ALL THE ROWS OF TREES STOOD SO THICK AND CLOSE
8058-99403-0015 THAT THE HOUSE COULD NOT BE GOT AT SAVE BY SUCH BLIND WAYS AS NONE BUT THOSE WHO MADE THEM COULD FIND OUT WHY HAVE YOU BUILT ALL THESE FORTS SAID I
8058-99403-0016 CARL TOLD ME THAT HE FELT SURE I SHOULD SAY THERE WAS MUCH NEED OF THEM WHEN I HEARD HOW THEY HAD SPENT THEIR TIME SINCE THEY HAD COME TO THE ISLE
8058-99403-0017 SIR ALL THESE MEN OWE THEIR LIVES TO YOU THEN ONE BY ONE THEY CAME UP TO ME NOT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THE MERE CREW OF A SHIP BUT LIKE MEN OF RANK WHO HAD COME TO KISS THE HAND OF THEIR KING
8058-99403-0018 TILL WE HAD LAID TWO OF THE MEN IN CHAINS THE NEXT DAY THESE TWO MEN STOLE EACH OF THEM A GUN AND SOME SMALL ARMS AND TOOK THE SHIP'S BOAT AND RAN OFF WITH IT TO JOIN THE THREE BAD MEN ON SHORE
8058-99403-0019 AS SOON AS I FOUND THIS OUT I SENT THE LONG BOAT ON SHORE WITH TWELVE MEN AND THE MATE AND OFF THEY WENT TO SEEK THE TWO WHO HAD LEFT THE SHIP BUT THEIR SEARCH WAS IN VAIN NOR COULD THEY FIND ONE OF THE REST
8058-99403-0020 FOR THEY HAD ALL FLED TO THE WOODS WHEN THEY SAW THE BOAT WE HAD NOW LOST FIVE OF THE CREW BUT THE THREE FIRST WERE SO MUCH WORSE THAN THE LAST TWO THAT IN A FEW DAYS THEY SENT THEM OUT OF DOORS AND WOULD HAVE NO MORE TO DO WITH THEM
8058-99403-0021 NOR WOULD THEY FOR A LONG WHILE GIVE THEM FOOD TO EAT SO THE TWO POOR MEN HAD TO LIVE AS WELL AS THEY COULD BY HARD WORK AND THEY SET UP THEIR TENTS ON THE NORTH SHORE OF THE ISLE TO BE OUT OF THE WAY OF THE WILD MEN
8058-99403-0022 WHO WERE WONT TO LAND ON THE EAST SIDE HERE THEY BUILT THEM TWO HUTS ONE TO LODGE IN AND ONE TO LAY UP THEIR STORES IN AND THE MEN FROM SPAIN GAVE THEM SOME CORN FOR SEED AS WELL AS SOME PEAS WHICH I HAD LEFT THEM
8058-99403-0023 THEY SOON LEARNED TO DIG AND PLANT AND HEDGE IN THEIR LAND IN THE MODE WHICH I HAD SET FOR THEM AND IN SHORT TO LEAD GOOD LIVES SO THAT I SHALL NOW CALL THEM THE TWO GOOD MEN BUT WHEN THE THREE BAD MEN SAW THIS
8058-99403-0024 THEY WERE FULL OF SPITE AND CAME ONE DAY TO TEASE AND VEX THEM THEY TOLD THEM THAT THE ISLE WAS THEIR OWN AND THAT NO ONE ELSE HAD A RIGHT TO BUILD ON IT IF THEY DID NOT PAY RENT THE TWO GOOD MEN THOUGHT AT FIRST THAT THEY WERE IN JEST
8058-99403-0025 AND TOLD THEM TO COME AND SIT DOWN AND SEE WHAT FINE HOMES THEY HAD BUILT AND SAY WHAT RENT THEY WOULD ASK
8058-99403-0026 AND WOULD HAVE SET IT ON FIRE HAD NOT ONE OF THE TWO GOOD MEN TROD THE FIRE OUT WITH HIS FEET THE BAD MAN WAS IN SUCH A RAGE AT THIS THAT HE RAN AT HIM WITH A POLE HE HAD IN HIS HAND
8058-99403-0027 AND THIS BROUGHT ON A FIGHT THE END OF WHICH WAS THAT THE THREE MEN HAD TO STAND OFF BUT IN A SHORT TIME THEY CAME BACK AND TROD DOWN THE CORN AND SHOT THE GOATS AND YOUNG KIDS WHICH THE POOR MEN HAD GOT TO BRING UP TAME FOR THEIR STORE
8058-99403-0028 ONE DAY WHEN THE TWO MEN WERE OUT THEY CAME TO THEIR HOME AND SAID HA THERE'S THE NEST BUT THE BIRDS ARE FLOWN THEY THEN SET TO WORK TO PULL DOWN BOTH THE HUTS AND LEFT NOT A STICK NOR SCARCE A SIGN ON THE GROUND TO SHOW WHERE THE TENTS HAD STOOD
8058-99403-0029 THEY TORE UP TOO ALL THE GOODS AND STOCK THAT THEY COULD FIND AND WHEN THEY HAD DONE THIS THEY TOLD IT ALL TO THE MEN OF SPAIN AND SAID YOU SIRS SHALL HAVE THE SAME SAUCE IF YOU DO NOT MEND YOUR WAYS
8058-99403-0030 THEY THEN FELL TO BLOWS AND HARD WORDS BUT CARL HAD THEM BOUND IN CORDS AND TOOK THEIR ARMS FROM THEM THE MEN OF SPAIN THEN SAID THEY WOULD DO THEM NO HARM AND IF THEY WOULD LIVE AT PEACE THEY WOULD HELP THEM
8058-99403-0031 ONE NIGHT CARL WHOM I SHALL CALL THE CHIEF AS HE TOOK THE LEAD OF ALL THE REST FELT A GREAT WEIGHT ON HIS MIND AND COULD GET NO SLEEP THOUGH HE WAS QUITE WELL IN HEALTH
8058-99403-0032 BUT AS IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE FAR AND HE HEARD NO NOISE HE WENT BACK TO HIS BED STILL IT WAS ALL ONE HE COULD NOT SLEEP AND THOUGH HE KNEW NOT WHY HIS THOUGHTS WOULD GIVE HIM NO REST HE THEN WOKE UP ONE OF HIS FRIENDS
8058-99403-0033 AND TOLD HIM HOW IT HAD BEEN WITH HIM SAY YOU SO SAID HE WHAT IF THERE SHOULD BE SOME BAD PLOT AT WORK NEAR US THEY THEN SET OFF TO THE TOP OF THE HILL WHERE I WAS WONT TO GO AND FROM THENCE THEY SAW THE LIGHT OF A FIRE QUITE A SHORT WAY FROM THEM
8058-99403-0034 AND HEARD THE SOUNDS OF MEN NOT OF ONE OR TWO BUT OF A GREAT CROWD WE NEED NOT DOUBT THAT THE CHIEF AND THE MAN WITH HIM NOW RAN BACK AT ONCE TO TELL ALL THE REST WHAT THEY HAD SEEN AND WHEN THEY HEARD THE NEWS
8058-99403-0035 THEY COULD NOT BE KEPT CLOSE WHERE THEY WERE BUT MUST ALL RUN OUT TO SEE HOW THINGS STOOD AT LAST THEY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING TO DO WOULD BE WHILE IT WAS DARK TO SEND OLD JAF OUT AS A SPY TO LEARN WHO THEY WERE AND WHAT THEY MEANT TO DO
8058-99403-0036 WHEN THE OLD MAN HAD BEEN GONE AN HOUR OR TWO HE BROUGHT WORD BACK THAT HE HAD BEEN IN THE MIDST OF THE FOES THOUGH THEY HAD NOT SEEN HIM AND THAT THEY WERE IN TWO SETS OR TRIBES WHO WERE AT WAR AND HAD COME THERE TO FIGHT
8058-99403-0037 AND SO IT WAS FOR IN A SHORT TIME THEY HEARD THE NOISE OF THE FIGHT WHICH WENT ON FOR TWO HOURS AND AT THE END WITH THREE LOUD SHOUTS OR SCREAMS THEY LEFT THE ISLE IN THEIR BOATS
8058-99403-0038 THUS MY FRIENDS WERE SET FREE FROM ALL THEIR FEARS AND SAW NO MORE OF THEIR WILD FOES FOR SOME TIME ONE DAY A WHIM TOOK THE THREE BAD MEN THAT THEY WOULD GO TO THE MAIN LAND FROM WHENCE THE WILD MEN CAME
8058-99403-0039 AND TRY IF THEY COULD NOT SEIZE SOME OF THEM AND BRING THEM HOME AS SLAVES SO AS TO MAKE THEM DO THE HARD PART OF THEIR WORK FOR THEM THE CHIEF GAVE THEM ALL THE ARMS AND STORES THAT THEY COULD WANT AND A LARGE BOAT TO GO IN
8058-99403-0040 BUT WHEN THEY BADE THEM GOD SPEED NO ONE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FIND THEIR WAY BACK TO THE ISLE BUT LO IN THREE WEEKS AND A DAY THEY DID IN TRUTH COME BACK ONE OF THE TWO GOOD MEN WAS THE FIRST TO CATCH SIGHT OF THEM AND TELL THE NEWS TO HIS FRIENDS
8058-99403-0041 THE MEN SAID THAT THEY HAD FOUND THE LAND IN TWO DAYS AND THAT THE WILD MEN GAVE THEM ROOTS AND FISH TO EAT AND WERE SO KIND AS TO BRING DOWN EIGHT SLAVES TO TAKE BACK WITH THEM THREE OF WHOM WERE MEN AND FIVE WERE GIRLS
8058-99403-0042 SO THEY GAVE THEIR GOOD HOSTS AN AXE AN OLD KEY AND A KNIFE AND BROUGHT OFF THE SLAVES IN THEIR BOAT TO THE ISLE
