2004-147981-0000 THERE WAS A CURIOUS SOCIAL SITUATION IN BLACK HAWK ALL THE YOUNG MEN FELT THE ATTRACTION OF THE FINE WELL SET UP COUNTRY GIRLS WHO HAD COME TO TOWN TO EARN A LIVING AND IN NEARLY EVERY CASE TO HELP THE FATHER STRUGGLE OUT OF DEBT
2004-147981-0001 AND WHO HAVE HAD ADVANTAGES NEVER SEEM TO ME WHEN I MEET THEM NOW HALF AS INTERESTING OR AS WELL EDUCATED THE OLDER GIRLS WHO HELPED TO BREAK UP THE WILD SOD LEARNED SO MUCH FROM LIFE FROM POVERTY FROM THEIR MOTHERS AND GRANDMOTHERS
2004-147981-0002 THEY HAD ALL LIKE ANTONIA BEEN EARLY AWAKENED AND MADE OBSERVANT BY COMING AT A TENDER AGE FROM AN OLD COUNTRY TO A NEW I CAN REMEMBER A SCORE OF THESE COUNTRY GIRLS WHO WERE IN SERVICE IN BLACK HAWK DURING THE FEW YEARS I LIVED THERE
2004-147981-0003 DEVELOPED INTO A POSITIVE CARRIAGE AND FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND MADE THEM CONSPICUOUS AMONG BLACK HAWK WOMEN THAT WAS BEFORE THE DAY OF HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETICS GIRLS WHO HAD TO WALK MORE THAN HALF A MILE TO SCHOOL WERE PITIED
2004-147981-0004 THERE WAS NOT A TENNIS COURT IN THE TOWN PHYSICAL EXERCISE WAS THOUGHT RATHER INELEGANT FOR THE DAUGHTERS OF WELL TO DO FAMILIES SOME OF THE HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS WERE JOLLY AND PRETTY BUT THEY STAYED INDOORS IN WINTER BECAUSE OF THE COLD AND IN SUMMER BECAUSE OF THE HEAT
2004-147981-0005 WHEN ONE DANCED WITH THEM THEIR BODIES NEVER MOVED INSIDE THEIR CLOTHES THEIR MUSCLES SEEMED TO ASK BUT ONE THING NOT TO BE DISTURBED I REMEMBER THOSE GIRLS MERELY AS FACES IN THE SCHOOLROOM GAY AND ROSY OR LISTLESS AND DULL
2004-147981-0006 THAT THEY WERE REFINED AND THAT THE COUNTRY GIRLS WHO WORKED OUT WERE NOT THE AMERICAN FARMERS IN OUR COUNTY WERE QUITE AS HARD PRESSED AS THEIR NEIGHBORS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES ALL ALIKE HAD COME TO NEBRASKA WITH LITTLE CAPITAL
2004-147981-0007 AND NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE SOIL THEY MUST SUBDUE ALL HAD BORROWED MONEY ON THEIR LAND BUT NO MATTER IN WHAT STRAITS THE PENNSYLVANIAN OR VIRGINIAN FOUND HIMSELF HE WOULD NOT LET HIS DAUGHTERS GO OUT INTO SERVICE
2004-147981-0008 DETERMINED TO HELP IN THE STRUGGLE TO CLEAR THE HOMESTEAD FROM DEBT THEY HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO GO INTO SERVICE SOME OF THEM AFTER THEY CAME TO TOWN REMAINED AS SERIOUS AND AS DISCREET IN BEHAVIOR
2004-147981-0009 OTHERS LIKE THE THREE BOHEMIAN MARYS TRIED TO MAKE UP FOR THE YEARS OF YOUTH THEY HAD LOST BUT EVERY ONE OF THEM DID WHAT SHE HAD SET OUT TO DO AND SENT HOME THOSE HARD EARNED DOLLARS THE GIRLS I KNEW WERE ALWAYS HELPING
2004-147981-0010 TO PAY FOR PLOUGHS AND REAPERS BROOD SOWS OR STEERS TO FATTEN ONE RESULT OF THIS FAMILY SOLIDARITY WAS THAT THE FOREIGN FARMERS IN OUR COUNTY WERE THE FIRST TO BECOME PROSPEROUS AFTER THE FATHERS WERE OUT OF DEBT
2004-147981-0011 THE DAUGHTERS MARRIED THE SONS OF NEIGHBORS USUALLY OF LIKE NATIONALITY AND THE GIRLS WHO ONCE WORKED IN BLACK HAWK KITCHENS ARE TO DAY MANAGING BIG FARMS AND FINE FAMILIES OF THEIR OWN THEIR CHILDREN ARE BETTER OFF
2004-147981-0012 THAN THE CHILDREN OF THE TOWN WOMEN THEY USED TO SERVE I THOUGHT THE ATTITUDE OF THE TOWN PEOPLE TOWARD THESE GIRLS VERY STUPID IF I TOLD MY SCHOOLMATES THAT LENA LINGARD'S GRANDFATHER WAS A CLERGYMAN AND MUCH RESPECTED IN NORWAY
2004-147981-0013 THEY LOOKED AT ME BLANKLY WHAT DID IT MATTER ALL FOREIGNERS WERE IGNORANT PEOPLE WHO COULD N'T SPEAK ENGLISH THERE WAS NOT A MAN IN BLACK HAWK WHO HAD THE INTELLIGENCE OR CULTIVATION MUCH LESS THE PERSONAL DISTINCTION
2004-147981-0014 YET PEOPLE SAW NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HER AND THE THREE MARYS THEY WERE ALL BOHEMIANS ALL HIRED GIRLS I ALWAYS KNEW I SHOULD LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO SEE MY COUNTRY GIRLS COME INTO THEIR OWN AND I HAVE
2004-147981-0015 TO DAY THE BEST THAT A HARASSED BLACK HAWK MERCHANT CAN HOPE FOR IS TO SELL PROVISIONS AND FARM MACHINERY AND AUTOMOBILES TO THE RICH FARMS WHERE THAT FIRST CROP OF STALWART BOHEMIAN AND SCANDINAVIAN GIRLS
2004-147981-0016 ARE NOW THE MISTRESSES THE BLACK HAWK BOYS LOOKED FORWARD TO MARRYING BLACK HAWK GIRLS AND LIVING IN A BRAND NEW LITTLE HOUSE WITH BEST CHAIRS THAT MUST NOT BE SAT UPON AND HAND PAINTED CHINA THAT MUST NOT BE USED
2004-147981-0017 BUT SOMETIMES A YOUNG FELLOW WOULD LOOK UP FROM HIS LEDGER OR OUT THROUGH THE GRATING OF HIS FATHER'S BANK AND LET HIS EYES FOLLOW LENA LINGARD AS SHE PASSED THE WINDOW WITH HER SLOW UNDULATING WALK OR TINY SODERBALL
2004-147981-0018 TRIPPING BY IN HER SHORT SKIRT AND STRIPED STOCKINGS THE COUNTRY GIRLS WERE CONSIDERED A MENACE TO THE SOCIAL ORDER THEIR BEAUTY SHONE OUT TOO BOLDLY AGAINST A CONVENTIONAL BACKGROUND BUT ANXIOUS MOTHERS NEED HAVE FELT NO ALARM
2004-147981-0019 THEY MISTOOK THE METTLE OF THEIR SONS THE RESPECT FOR RESPECTABILITY WAS STRONGER THAN ANY DESIRE IN BLACK HAWK YOUTH OUR YOUNG MAN OF POSITION WAS LIKE THE SON OF A ROYAL HOUSE THE BOY WHO SWEPT OUT HIS OFFICE
2004-147981-0020 OR DROVE HIS DELIVERY WAGON MIGHT FROLIC WITH THE JOLLY COUNTRY GIRLS BUT HE HIMSELF MUST SIT ALL EVENING IN A PLUSH PARLOR WHERE CONVERSATION DRAGGED SO PERCEPTIBLY THAT THE FATHER OFTEN CAME IN AND MADE BLUNDERING EFFORTS TO WARM UP THE ATMOSPHERE
2004-147981-0021 ON HIS WAY HOME FROM HIS DULL CALL HE WOULD PERHAPS MEET TONY AND LENA COMING ALONG THE SIDEWALK WHISPERING TO EACH OTHER OR THE THREE BOHEMIAN MARYS IN THEIR LONG PLUSH COATS AND CAPS COMPORTING THEMSELVES WITH A DIGNITY
2004-147981-0022 THAT ONLY MADE THEIR EVENTFUL HISTORIES THE MORE PIQUANT IF HE WENT TO THE HOTEL TO SEE A TRAVELING MAN ON BUSINESS THERE WAS TINY ARCHING HER SHOULDERS AT HIM LIKE A KITTEN IF HE WENT INTO THE LAUNDRY TO GET HIS COLLARS THERE WERE THE FOUR DANISH GIRLS
2004-147981-0023 AND EVEN GREW BOLD ENOUGH TO WALK HOME WITH HER IF HIS SISTERS OR THEIR FRIENDS HAPPENED TO BE AMONG THE ONLOOKERS ON POPULAR NIGHTS SYLVESTER STOOD BACK IN THE SHADOW UNDER THE COTTONWOOD TREES SMOKING AND WATCHING LENA WITH A HARASSED EXPRESSION
2004-147981-0024 WHEN LENA WENT HOME FOR A WEEK TO VISIT HER MOTHER I HEARD FROM ANTONIA THAT YOUNG LOVETT DROVE ALL THE WAY OUT THERE TO SEE HER AND TOOK HER BUGGY RIDING IN MY INGENUOUSNESS I HOPED THAT SYLVESTER WOULD MARRY LENA
2004-147981-0025 AND THUS GIVE ALL THE COUNTRY GIRLS A BETTER POSITION IN THE TOWN SYLVESTER DALLIED ABOUT LENA UNTIL HE BEGAN TO MAKE MISTAKES IN HIS WORK HAD TO STAY AT THE BANK UNTIL AFTER DARK TO MAKE HIS BOOKS BALANCE
2004-147981-0026 NOR LIFTED HIS EYES AS HE CEREMONIOUSLY TIPPED HIS HAT WHEN HE HAPPENED TO MEET HER ON THE SIDEWALK SO THAT WAS WHAT THEY WERE LIKE I THOUGHT THESE WHITE HANDED HIGH COLLARED CLERKS AND BOOKKEEPERS
