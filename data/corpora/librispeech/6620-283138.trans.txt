6620-283138-0000 NOTHING IS MORE USUAL THAN FOR PHILOSOPHERS TO ENCROACH UPON THE PROVINCE OF GRAMMARIANS AND TO ENGAGE IN DISPUTES OF WORDS WHILE THEY IMAGINE THAT THEY ARE HANDLING CONTROVERSIES OF THE DEEPEST IMPORTANCE AND CONCERN
6620-283138-0001 IT WAS IN ORDER TO AVOID ALTERCATIONS SO FRIVOLOUS AND ENDLESS THAT I ENDEAVOURED TO STATE WITH THE UTMOST CAUTION THE OBJECT OF OUR PRESENT ENQUIRY AND PROPOSED SIMPLY TO COLLECT ON THE ONE HAND A LIST OF THOSE MENTAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE THE OBJECT OF LOVE OR ESTEEM
6620-283138-0002 AND FORM A PART OF PERSONAL MERIT AND ON THE OTHER HAND A CATALOGUE OF THOSE QUALITIES WHICH ARE THE OBJECT OF CENSURE OR REPROACH AND WHICH DETRACT FROM THE CHARACTER OF THE PERSON POSSESSED OF THEM SUBJOINING SOME REFLECTIONS CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF THESE SENTIMENTS OF PRAISE OR BLAME
6620-283138-0003 ON ALL OCCASIONS WHERE THERE MIGHT ARISE THE LEAST HESITATION I AVOIDED THE TERMS VIRTUE AND VICE BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE QUALITIES WHICH I CLASSED AMONG THE OBJECTS OF PRAISE RECEIVE IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE THE APPELLATION OF TALENTS RATHER THAN OF VIRTUES
6620-283138-0004 AS SOME OF THE BLAMEABLE OR CENSURABLE QUALITIES ARE OFTEN CALLED DEFECTS RATHER THAN VICES IT MAY NOW PERHAPS BE EXPECTED THAT BEFORE WE CONCLUDE THIS MORAL ENQUIRY WE SHOULD EXACTLY SEPARATE THE ONE FROM THE OTHER
6620-283138-0005 SHOULD MARK THE PRECISE BOUNDARIES OF VIRTUES AND TALENTS VICES AND DEFECTS AND SHOULD EXPLAIN THE REASON AND ORIGIN OF THAT DISTINCTION BUT IN ORDER TO EXCUSE MYSELF FROM THIS UNDERTAKING WHICH WOULD AT LAST PROVE ONLY A GRAMMATICAL ENQUIRY
6620-283138-0006 I SHALL SUBJOIN THE FOUR FOLLOWING REFLECTIONS WHICH SHALL CONTAIN ALL THAT I INTEND TO SAY ON THE PRESENT SUBJECT FIRST I DO NOT FIND THAT IN THE ENGLISH OR ANY OTHER MODERN TONGUE THE BOUNDARIES ARE EXACTLY FIXED BETWEEN VIRTUES AND TALENTS VICES AND DEFECTS
6620-283138-0007 OR THAT A PRECISE DEFINITION CAN BE GIVEN OF THE ONE AS CONTRADISTINGUISHED FROM THE OTHER
6620-283138-0008 WE SHOULD SOON RECOLLECT THE QUALITIES OF COURAGE EQUANIMITY PATIENCE SELF COMMAND WITH MANY OTHERS WHICH ALMOST EVERY LANGUAGE CLASSES UNDER THIS APPELLATION THOUGH THEY DEPEND LITTLE OR NOT AT ALL ON OUR CHOICE
6620-283138-0009 SHOULD WE AFFIRM THAT THE QUALITIES ALONE WHICH PROMPT US TO ACT OUR PART IN SOCIETY ARE ENTITLED TO THAT HONOURABLE DISTINCTION IT MUST IMMEDIATELY OCCUR THAT THESE ARE INDEED THE MOST VALUABLE QUALITIES AND ARE COMMONLY DENOMINATED THE SOCIAL VIRTUES
6620-283138-0010 BUT THAT THIS VERY EPITHET SUPPOSES THAT THERE ARE ALSO VIRTUES OF ANOTHER SPECIES SHOULD WE LAY HOLD OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL ENDOWMENTS AND AFFIRM THE LAST ALONE TO BE THE REAL AND GENUINE VIRTUES BECAUSE THEY ALONE LEAD TO ACTION
6620-283138-0011 WE SHOULD FIND THAT MANY OF THOSE QUALITIES USUALLY CALLED INTELLECTUAL VIRTUES SUCH AS PRUDENCE PENETRATION DISCERNMENT DISCRETION HAD ALSO A CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE ON CONDUCT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE HEART AND THE HEAD MAY ALSO BE ADOPTED
6620-283138-0012 AND THESE ALONE MAY BE CALLED THE GENUINE VIRTUES BUT INDUSTRY FRUGALITY TEMPERANCE SECRECY PERSEVERANCE AND MANY OTHER LAUDABLE POWERS OR HABITS GENERALLY STILLED VIRTUES ARE EXERTED WITHOUT ANY IMMEDIATE SENTIMENT IN THE PERSON POSSESSED OF THEM
6620-283138-0013 AND ARE ONLY KNOWN TO HIM BY THEIR EFFECTS IT IS FORTUNATE AMIDST ALL THIS SEEMING PERPLEXITY THAT THE QUESTION BEING MERELY VERBAL CANNOT POSSIBLY BE OF ANY IMPORTANCE
6620-283138-0014 A MORAL PHILOSOPHICAL DISCOURSE NEEDS NOT ENTER INTO ALL THESE CAPRICES OF LANGUAGE WHICH ARE SO VARIABLE IN DIFFERENT DIALECTS AND IN DIFFERENT AGES OF THE SAME DIALECT BUT ON THE WHOLE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THOUGH IT IS ALWAYS ALLOWED THAT THERE ARE VIRTUES OF MANY DIFFERENT KINDS
6620-283138-0015 YET WHEN A MAN IS CALLED VIRTUOUS OR IS DENOMINATED A MAN OF VIRTUE WE CHIEFLY REGARD HIS SOCIAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE INDEED THE MOST VALUABLE
6620-283138-0016 IT IS AT THE SAME TIME CERTAIN THAT ANY REMARKABLE DEFECT IN COURAGE TEMPERANCE ECONOMY INDUSTRY UNDERSTANDING DIGNITY OF MIND WOULD BEREAVE EVEN A VERY GOOD NATURED HONEST MAN OF THIS HONOURABLE APPELLATION
6620-283138-0017 WHO DID EVER SAY EXCEPT BY WAY OF IRONY THAT SUCH A ONE WAS A MAN OF GREAT VIRTUE BUT AN EGREGIOUS BLOCKHEAD BUT SECONDLY IT IS NO WONDER THAT LANGUAGES SHOULD NOT BE VERY PRECISE IN MARKING THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN VIRTUES AND TALENTS VICES AND DEFECTS
6620-283138-0018 SINCE THERE IS SO LITTLE DISTINCTION MADE IN OUR INTERNAL ESTIMATION OF THEM IT SEEMS INDEED CERTAIN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF CONSCIOUS WORTH THE SELF SATISFACTION PROCEEDING FROM A REVIEW OF A MAN'S OWN CONDUCT AND CHARACTER IT SEEMS CERTAIN I SAY THAT THIS SENTIMENT
6620-283138-0019 WHICH THOUGH THE MOST COMMON OF ALL OTHERS HAS NO PROPER NAME IN OUR LANGUAGE
6620-283138-0020 FOOTNOTE THE TERM PRIDE IS COMMONLY TAKEN IN A BAD SENSE BUT THIS SENTIMENT SEEMS INDIFFERENT AND MAY BE EITHER GOOD OR BAD ACCORDING AS IT IS WELL OR ILL FOUNDED
6620-283138-0021 THEY STILL HAUNT HIS SOLITARY HOURS DAMP HIS MOST ASPIRING THOUGHTS AND SHOW HIM EVEN TO HIMSELF IN THE MOST CONTEMPTIBLE AND MOST ODIOUS COLOURS IMAGINABLE
6620-283138-0022 WHAT IS THERE TOO WE ARE MORE ANXIOUS TO CONCEAL FROM OTHERS THAN SUCH BLUNDERS INFIRMITIES AND MEANNESSES OR MORE DREAD TO HAVE EXPOSED BY RAILLERY AND SATIRE
6620-283138-0023 THESE WE DISPLAY WITH CARE IF NOT WITH OSTENTATION AND WE COMMONLY SHOW MORE AMBITION OF EXCELLING IN THEM THAN EVEN IN THE SOCIAL VIRTUES THEMSELVES WHICH ARE IN REALITY OF SUCH SUPERIOR EXCELLENCE
6620-283138-0024 GOOD NATURE AND HONESTY ESPECIALLY THE LATTER ARE SO INDISPENSABLY REQUIRED THAT THOUGH THE GREATEST CENSURE ATTENDS ANY VIOLATION OF THESE DUTIES NO EMINENT PRAISE FOLLOWS SUCH COMMON INSTANCES OF THEM AS SEEM ESSENTIAL TO THE SUPPORT OF HUMAN SOCIETY
6620-283138-0025 AND HENCE THE REASON IN MY OPINION WHY THOUGH MEN OFTEN EXTOL SO LIBERALLY THE QUALITIES OF THEIR HEART THEY ARE SHY IN COMMENDING THE ENDOWMENTS OF THEIR HEAD BECAUSE THE LATTER VIRTUES BEING SUPPOSED MORE RARE AND EXTRAORDINARY
6620-283138-0026 ARE OBSERVED TO BE THE MORE USUAL OBJECTS OF PRIDE AND SELF CONCEIT AND WHEN BOASTED OF BEGET A STRONG SUSPICION OF THESE SENTIMENTS IT IS HARD TO TELL WHETHER YOU HURT A MAN'S CHARACTER MOST BY CALLING HIM A KNAVE OR A COWARD
6620-283138-0027 AND WHETHER A BEASTLY GLUTTON OR DRUNKARD BE NOT AS ODIOUS AND CONTEMPTIBLE AS A SELFISH UNGENEROUS MISER GIVE ME MY CHOICE AND I WOULD RATHER FOR MY OWN HAPPINESS AND SELF ENJOYMENT HAVE A FRIENDLY HUMANE HEART THAN POSSESS ALL THE OTHER VIRTUES OF DEMOSTHENES AND PHILIP UNITED
6620-283138-0028 BUT I WOULD RATHER PASS WITH THE WORLD FOR ONE ENDOWED WITH EXTENSIVE GENIUS AND INTREPID COURAGE AND SHOULD THENCE EXPECT STRONGER INSTANCES OF GENERAL APPLAUSE AND ADMIRATION THE FIGURE WHICH A MAN MAKES IN LIFE THE RECEPTION WHICH HE MEETS WITH IN COMPANY
6620-283138-0029 THE ESTEEM PAID HIM BY HIS ACQUAINTANCE ALL THESE ADVANTAGES DEPEND AS MUCH UPON HIS GOOD SENSE AND JUDGEMENT AS UPON ANY OTHER PART OF HIS CHARACTER HAD A MAN THE BEST INTENTIONS IN THE WORLD AND WERE THE FARTHEST REMOVED FROM ALL INJUSTICE AND VIOLENCE
6620-283138-0030 HE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO MAKE HIMSELF BE MUCH REGARDED WITHOUT A MODERATE SHARE AT LEAST OF PARTS AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS IT THEN WE CAN HERE DISPUTE ABOUT IF SENSE AND COURAGE TEMPERANCE AND INDUSTRY WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE CONFESSEDLY FORM A CONSIDERABLE PART OF PERSONAL MERIT
6620-283138-0031 IF A MAN POSSESSED OF THESE QUALITIES IS BOTH BETTER SATISFIED WITH HIMSELF AND BETTER ENTITLED TO THE GOOD WILL ESTEEM AND SERVICES OF OTHERS THAN ONE ENTIRELY DESTITUTE OF THEM IF IN SHORT THE SENTIMENTS ARE SIMILAR WHICH ARISE FROM THESE ENDOWMENTS AND FROM THE SOCIAL VIRTUES
6620-283138-0032 IS THERE ANY REASON FOR BEING SO EXTREMELY SCRUPULOUS ABOUT A WORD OR DISPUTING WHETHER THEY BE ENTITLED TO THE DENOMINATION OF VIRTUES
6620-283138-0033 IT MAY INDEED BE PRETENDED THAT THE SENTIMENT OF APPROBATION WHICH THOSE ACCOMPLISHMENTS PRODUCE BESIDES ITS BEING INFERIOR IS ALSO SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH ATTENDS THE VIRTUES OF JUSTICE AND HUMANITY
6620-283138-0034 BUT THIS SEEMS NOT A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR RANKING THEM ENTIRELY UNDER DIFFERENT CLASSES AND APPELLATIONS
6620-283138-0035 AS DRAWN BY SALLUST ARE BOTH OF THEM VIRTUOUS IN THE STRICTEST AND MOST LIMITED SENSE OF THE WORD BUT IN A DIFFERENT WAY NOR ARE THE SENTIMENTS ENTIRELY THE SAME WHICH ARISE FROM THEM THE ONE PRODUCES LOVE THE OTHER ESTEEM THE ONE IS AMIABLE THE OTHER AWFUL
6620-283138-0036 WE SHOULD WISH TO MEET THE ONE CHARACTER IN A FRIEND THE OTHER WE SHOULD BE AMBITIOUS OF IN OURSELVES IN LIKE MANNER THE APPROBATION WHICH ATTENDS TEMPERANCE OR INDUSTRY OR FRUGALITY MAY BE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH IS PAID TO THE SOCIAL VIRTUES WITHOUT MAKING THEM ENTIRELY OF A DIFFERENT SPECIES
6620-283138-0037 AND INDEED WE MAY OBSERVE THAT THESE ENDOWMENTS MORE THAN THE OTHER VIRTUES PRODUCE NOT ALL OF THEM THE SAME KIND OF APPROBATION GOOD SENSE AND GENIUS BEGET ESTEEM AND REGARD WIT AND HUMOUR EXCITE LOVE AND AFFECTION FOOTNOTE
6620-283138-0038 LOVE AND ESTEEM ARE NEARLY THE SAME PASSION AND ARISE FROM SIMILAR CAUSES THE QUALITIES WHICH PRODUCE BOTH ARE SUCH AS COMMUNICATE PLEASURES BUT WHERE THIS PLEASURE IS SEVERE AND SERIOUS
6620-283138-0039 IN ALL THESE CASES THE PASSION WHICH ARISES FROM THE PLEASURE IS MORE PROPERLY DENOMINATED ESTEEM THAN LOVE BENEVOLENCE ATTENDS BOTH BUT IS CONNECTED WITH LOVE IN A MORE EMINENT DEGREE
6620-283138-0040 THERE SEEMS TO BE STILL A STRONGER MIXTURE OF PRIDE IN CONTEMPT THAN OF HUMILITY IN ESTEEM
6620-283138-0041 ALL THESE VARIOUS MIXTURES AND COMPOSITIONS AND APPEARANCES OF SENTIMENT FROM A VERY CURIOUS SUBJECT OF SPECULATION BUT ARE WIDE FOR OUR PRESENT PURPOSE THROUGHOUT THIS ENQUIRY WE ALWAYS CONSIDER IN GENERAL WHAT QUALITIES ARE A SUBJECT OF PRAISE OR OF CENSURE
6620-283138-0042 AS WELL AS WHAT IS HATED AND WE HERE ENDEAVOUR TO TAKE OBJECTS ACCORDING TO THEIR MOST SIMPLE VIEWS AND APPEARANCES THESE SCIENCES ARE BUT TOO APT TO APPEAR ABSTRACT TO COMMON READERS EVEN WITH ALL THE PRECAUTIONS WHICH WE CAN TAKE TO CLEAR THEM FROM SUPERFLUOUS SPECULATIONS AND BRING THEM DOWN TO EVERY CAPACITY
6620-283138-0043 FOR WE SCRUPLE NOT TO CALL THEM SUCH BRING MISERY UNPITIED AND CONTEMPT ON EVERY ONE ADDICTED TO THEM ACHAEUS A WISE AND PRUDENT PRINCE FELL INTO A FATAL SNARE WHICH COST HIM HIS CROWN AND LIFE
6620-283138-0044 TO WIT THAT THE ANCIENT MORALISTS THE BEST MODELS MADE NO MATERIAL DISTINCTION AMONG THE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF MENTAL ENDOWMENTS AND DEFECTS BUT TREATED ALL ALIKE UNDER THE APPELLATION OF VIRTUES AND VICES
6620-283138-0045 OUR SOCIAL DUTIES FORM BUT ONE HEAD IN THE GENERAL DISTRIBUTION OF HIS SUBJECT FOOTNOTE
6620-283138-0046 OR PERSUADE HIM THAT NO QUALITIES WERE TO BE ADMITTED AS VIRTUES OR ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE A PART OF PERSONAL MERIT BUT WHAT WERE RECOMMENDED BY THE WHOLE DUTY OF MAN
6620-283138-0047 WE NEED ONLY PERUSE THE TITLES OF CHAPTERS IN ARISTOTLE'S ETHICS TO BE CONVINCED THAT HE RANKS COURAGE TEMPERANCE MAGNIFICENCE MAGNANIMITY MODESTY PRUDENCE AND A MANLY OPENNESS AMONG THE VIRTUES AS WELL AS JUSTICE AND FRIENDSHIP
6620-283138-0048 TO SUSTAIN AND TO ABSTAIN THAT IS TO BE PATIENT AND CONTINENT APPEARED TO SOME OF THE ANCIENTS A SUMMARY COMPREHENSION OF ALL MORALS EPICTETUS HAS SCARCELY EVER MENTIONED THE SENTIMENT OF HUMANITY AND COMPASSION BUT IN ORDER TO PUT HIS DISCIPLES ON THEIR GUARD AGAINST IT
6620-283138-0049 AND IT WERE THEREFORE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHETHER HE RENDERED HIMSELF DEARER TO THE GENERAL OR TO THE ARMY TO NONE WOULD HASDRUBAL ENTRUST MORE WILLINGLY THE CONDUCT OF ANY DANGEROUS ENTERPRIZE UNDER NONE DID THE SOLDIERS DISCOVER MORE COURAGE AND CONFIDENCE
6620-283138-0050 GREAT BOLDNESS IN FACING DANGER GREAT PRUDENCE IN THE MIDST OF IT NO LABOUR COULD FATIGUE HIS BODY OR SUBDUE HIS MIND COLD AND HEAT WERE INDIFFERENT TO HIM
6620-283138-0051 MEAT AND DRINK HE SOUGHT AS SUPPLIES TO THE NECESSITIES OF NATURE NOT AS GRATIFICATIONS OF HIS VOLUPTUOUS APPETITES WAKING OR REST HE USED INDISCRIMINATELY BY NIGHT OR BY DAY THESE GREAT VIRTUES WERE BALANCED BY GREAT VICES
6620-283138-0052 INHUMAN CRUELTY PERFIDY MORE THAN PUNIC NO TRUTH NO FAITH NO REGARD TO OATHS PROMISES OR RELIGION
6620-283138-0053 IN THIS POPE SAYS HE THERE WAS A SINGULAR CAPACITY AND JUDGEMENT ADMIRABLE PRUDENCE A WONDERFUL TALENT OF PERSUASION AND IN ALL MOMENTOUS ENTERPRIZES A DILIGENCE AND DEXTERITY INCREDIBLE BUT THESE VIRTUES WERE INFINITELY OVERBALANCED BY HIS VICES
6620-283138-0054 BROUGHT THE CARTHAGINIAN STATE INTO THE UTMOST DANGER AND AT LAST DIED IN OLD AGE AND IN POSSESSION OF SOVEREIGN DIGNITY MUST HE NOT BE ALLOWED SOMETHING PRODIGIOUS AND EXTRAORDINARY
6620-283138-0055 HIS HISTORIAN THEREFORE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ALONE RELATED WHAT TENDED TO HIS REPROACH AND INFAMY BUT ALSO WHAT MIGHT REDOUND TO HIS PRAISE AND HONOUR
6620-283138-0056 IN SUGGESTING THE REASON WHY MODERN PHILOSOPHERS HAVE OFTEN FOLLOWED A COURSE IN THEIR MORAL ENQUIRIES SO DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE ANCIENTS IN LATER TIMES PHILOSOPHY OF ALL KINDS ESPECIALLY ETHICS
6620-283138-0057 HAVE BEEN MORE CLOSELY UNITED WITH THEOLOGY THAN EVER THEY WERE OBSERVED TO BE AMONG THE HEATHENS AND AS THIS LATTER SCIENCE ADMITS OF NO TERMS OF COMPOSITION BUT BENDS EVERY BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE TO ITS OWN PURPOSE WITHOUT MUCH REGARD TO THE PHENOMENA OF NATURE OR TO THE UNBIASSED SENTIMENTS OF THE MIND
6620-283138-0058 PHILOSOPHERS OR RATHER DIVINES UNDER THAT DISGUISE
6620-283138-0059 GUARDED BY THE SANCTIONS OF REWARD AND PUNISHMENT
6620-283138-0060 EVERY ONE MAY EMPLOY TERMS IN WHAT SENSE HE PLEASES BUT THIS IN THE MEAN TIME MUST BE ALLOWED THAT SENTIMENTS ARE EVERY DAY EXPERIENCED OF BLAME AND PRAISE WHICH HAVE OBJECTS BEYOND THE DOMINION OF THE WILL OR CHOICE
6620-283138-0061 AND OF WHICH IT BEHOVES US IF NOT AS MORALISTS AS SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHERS AT LEAST TO GIVE SOME SATISFACTORY THEORY AND EXPLICATION A BLEMISH A FAULT A VICE A CRIME THESE EXPRESSIONS SEEM TO DENOTE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF CENSURE AND DISAPPROBATION
6620-283138-0062 WHICH ARE HOWEVER ALL OF THEM AT THE BOTTOM PRETTY NEARLY ALL THE SAME KIND OF SPECIES THE EXPLICATION OF ONE WILL EASILY LEAD US INTO A JUST CONCEPTION OF THE OTHERS AND IT IS OF GREATER CONSEQUENCE TO ATTEND TO THINGS THAN TO VERBAL APPELLATIONS
