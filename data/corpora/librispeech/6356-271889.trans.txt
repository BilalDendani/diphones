6356-271889-0000 I EVENTUALLY WON THEIR CONFIDENCE AND INGRATIATED MYSELF WITH THEM BY ADVOCATING RUSSIAN FREEDOM IN A SERIES OF ARTICLES IN A CERTAIN LONDON JOURNAL WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF ENLISTING PUBLIC SYMPATHY WITH THE EXILES IN SUCH A MANNER
6356-271889-0001 THAT THE EDITOR RECEIVED A NUMBER OF DONATIONS WHICH HE HANDED TO ME WHILE I IN TURN CONVEYED THE MONEY TO MY FRIEND PAUL GRIGOROVITCH
6356-271889-0002 I WAS SITTING AT HOME READING AND SMOKING IN A VERY LAZY MOOD ONE WINTER'S EVENING WHEN THE SERVANT GIRL ENTERED AND HANDED ME A SOILED CRUMPLED LETTER WHICH SHE SAID HAD BEEN LEFT BY A STRANGE LOOKING FOREIGN WOMAN THIS DID NOT SURPRISE ME
6356-271889-0003 FOR I SOMETIMES RECEIVED MYSTERIOUS UNSIGNED NOTES FROM MY FRIENDS THE REFUGEES WHEN THEY DESIRED TO SEE ME THE EXILES ARE CONTINUALLY UNDER THE OBSERVATION OF THE OKHRANNOE OTDELENIE OR SECRET POLICE
6356-271889-0004 ATTACHED TO THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY HENCE THE CAUTIOUSNESS OF THEIR MOVEMENTS
6356-271889-0005 THE WORDS WRITTEN IN A FINE EDUCATED HAND EVIDENTLY A WOMAN'S WERE COME TO SPRINGFIELD LODGE SAINT MARGARET'S ROAD REGENT'S PARK TO NIGHT AT NINE IMPORTANT I CONFESS THE COMMUNICATION PUZZLED ME FOR I KNEW NO ONE LIVING AT THE ADDRESS
6356-271889-0006 AND THE HANDWRITING WAS UNFAMILIAR NEVERTHELESS I RESOLVED TO OBEY THE SUMMONS WITH SOME LITTLE DIFFICULTY I FOUND THE HOUSE IT STOOD BACK FROM THE ROAD CONCEALED BEHIND A HIGH WALL THE THOROUGHFARE WAS VERY QUIET AND EMINENTLY RESPECTABLE
6356-271889-0007 WHILE THE BARE BLACK BRANCHES OF THE GREAT TREES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD MET OVERHEAD FORMING A LONG AVENUE I GAVE THE SUMMONS USED AT GRIGOROVITCH'S NAMELY
6356-271889-0008 AND PRESENTLY THE HEAVY DOOR WAS OPENED BY A RUSSIAN MAID SERVANT WHO ARE YOU SHE DEMANDED IN BROKEN ENGLISH I TOLD HER MY NAME AND SHOWED HER THE NOTE I HAD RECEIVED
6356-271889-0009 STEP THIS WAY SIR IF YOU PLEASE SHE EXCLAIMED WHEN SHE HAD EXAMINED THE LETTER BY THE FEEBLE LIGHT SHED BY A NEIGHBOURING STREET LAMP THEN SHE CLOSED THE DOOR
6356-271889-0010 THE FRENCH WINDOWS OF WHICH OPENED OUT UPON A SPACIOUS TENNIS LAWN AROUND THE WALLS WERE HUNG SEVERAL CHOICE PAINTINGS AND I NOTICED THAT UPON THE TABLE LAY A NUMBER OF PAMPHLETS SIMILAR TO THOSE
6356-271889-0011 AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH RUSSIAN ETIQUETTE TAKING ONE HERSELF SHE STRUCK A VESTA AND LIT HERS QUITE NATURALLY THEN AS SHE SEATED HERSELF UPON A LOW CHAIR I RECOGNISED THAT SHE WAS VERY HANDSOME
6356-271889-0012 AND FEATURE WAS PERFECT HER COUNTENANCE HAD AN EXPRESSION OF CHARMING INGENUOUSNESS AND BLUSHING CANDOUR WHILE HER DARK BRILLIANT EYES HAD AN INTENSE AND BEWITCHING GLANCE IN HER BROWN HAIR WAS A HANDSOME CRESCENT OF DIAMONDS
6356-271889-0013 AND HER EVENING DRESS OF SOFT BLACK NET DISCLOSED HER WHITE CHEST AND ARMS WERE YOU SURPRISED AT MY CURT NOTE SHE ASKED SUDDENLY BLOWING A CLOUD OF SMOKE FROM HER PURSED UP LIPS WELL TO TELL THE TRUTH I WAS I ADMITTED
6356-271889-0014 YOU SEE WE ARE STRANGERS AH I FORGOT I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO INTRODUCE MYSELF SHE SAID LAUGHING I'M PRASCOVIE SOUVAROFF I KNOW YOUR NAME
6356-271889-0015 PRASCOVIE ROSE QUICKLY AND INTRODUCED HIM IVAN SOUVAROFF MY FATHER SHE EXCLAIMED AND WHEN WE HAD EXCHANGED GREETINGS SHE SAID NOW I'LL GO BECAUSE YOU WANT TO TALK WHEN YOU HAVE FINISHED YOUR CONVERSATION RING THE BELL
6356-271889-0016 AND I WILL RETURN AND BORE YOU AND LAUGHING GAILY SHE TRIPPED OUT OF THE ROOM SOUVAROFF TOOK A CIGARETTE LIT IT AND SEATING HIMSELF THOUGHTFULLY LOOKED INTO MY FACE AND SAID
6356-271889-0017 SIR BUT THE MATTER ABOUT WHICH I DESIRED TO SEE YOU IS ONE OF URGENCY I HAVE HEARD FROM GRIGOROVITCH AND OTHERS HOW YOU HAVE ASSISTED US IN LONDON AND IN PETERSBURG AND I THOUGHT IT PROBABLE
6356-271889-0018 YOU WOULD RENDER ME A SMALL PERSONAL SERVICE IF IT IS IN MY POWER I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY I REPLIED IT IS QUITE EASY IF YOU WILL ONLY DO IT IT IS MERELY TO INSERT A PARAGRAPH IN THE PAPERS AS NEWS
6356-271889-0019 I HAVE IT HERE READY WRITTEN THEN TAKING A SLIP OF PAPER FROM HIS POCKET HE READ THE FOLLOWING ANNOUNCEMENT PRASCOVIE ONLY DAUGHTER OF IVAN SOUVAROFF
6356-271889-0020 WHO ESCAPED FROM SIBERIA AFTER FIVE YEARS AT THE MINES DIED IN LONDON YESTERDAY DIED I REPEATED IN SURPRISE WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOUR DAUGHTER WAS HERE ALIVE AND WELL A FEW MOMENTS AGO
6356-271889-0021 I'M AWARE OF THAT HE REPLIED SMILING MYSTERIOUSLY YOU ARE NOT ONE OF US OTHERWISE I COULD TELL YOU THE REASON DOES SHE KNOW NO NO HE EXCLAIMED QUICKLY DON'T TELL HER PROMISE TO KEEP THE MATTER STRICTLY SECRET
6356-271889-0022 IF YOU PUBLISH THE PARAGRAPH I WILL SEE SHE DOES NOT GET HOLD OF A COPY OF THE PAPER VERY WELL I SAID I'LL DO AS YOU WISH IT WAS A PUZZLING PARAGRAPH BUT I HAD ALREADY CEASED TO BE ASTONISHED AT ANY ACTION ON THE PART OF THESE MEN
6356-271889-0023 FOR THE MORE I THOUGHT OVER THEIR SECRETS THE MORE COMPLICATED THEY ALWAYS APPEARED AS HE HANDED ME THE PIECE OF PAPER WITH AN EXPRESSION OF EARNEST THANKS I NOTICED THAT HE WORE A GLOVE UPON HIS RIGHT HAND AND COMMENTED MENTALLY
6356-271889-0024 THAT IT WAS A RATHER UNUSUAL CUSTOM TO WEAR ONE GLOVE WHILE IN THE HOUSE A FEW MOMENTS AFTER HE HAD RUNG THE BELL PRASCOVIE RETURNED FOLLOWED BY THE SERVANT BEARING A STEAMING SAMOVAR
6356-271889-0025 YOU'VE NOT BEEN VERY LONG OVER YOUR BUSINESS SHE REMARKED GLANCING AT ME WITH A SMILE NOW IT'S ALL OVER LET'S TALK I WAS NOTHING LOTH TO DO THIS AND SHE AND I RESUMED OUR CHAT
6356-271889-0026 THEN SOUVAROFF RELATED THE STORY OF HIS IMPRISONMENT HIS TRANSPORTATION TO SIBERIA HIS WORK IN THE KARA SILVER MINES AND HIS SUBSEQUENT ESCAPE AND JOURNEY TO ENGLAND WHERE HE HAD BEEN JOINED BY HIS DAUGHTER SOME ENGLISH PEOPLE THOUGHT SAID HE
6356-271889-0027 THAT RUSSIA WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THE FREEDOM THE NARODNOE PRAVO WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT POSSESS BUT HE ASSURED ME THAT THE TIME FOR AUTOCRACY WAS PAST THAT THE TZAR'S EMPIRE HAD OUTGROWN THE PERIOD OF BENEVOLENT DESPOTISM
6356-271889-0028 AND THAT THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE WERE QUITE CAPABLE OF GOVERNING THEMSELVES
6356-271889-0029 SEATED HERSELF AT THE PIANO AND SANG AN OLD RUSSIAN LOVE SONG IN A SWEET CONTRALTO FULL OF HARMONY AND TENDERNESS IN THE MEANTIME HER FATHER HAD LEFT US AND WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE TURNED UPON THE MUSIC STOOL AND WITH FEW FOREWORDS
6356-271889-0030 TO SATISFY HER CURIOSITY AND AT MY REQUEST SHE RETURNED TO THE INSTRUMENT AND COMMENCED ANOTHER SONG AS SHE SANG THE SECOND VERSE THERE MINGLED WITH THE MUSIC SOUNDS OF LOUD TALKING BOISTEROUS LAUGHTER AND GREETINGS IN RUSSIAN
6356-271889-0031 PRASCOVIE HEARD IT AND CEASED PLAYING FOR A MOMENT SHE SAT IN AN ATTENTIVE ATTITUDE I NOTICED HER FACE WORE AN EXPRESSION OF INTENSE ANXIETY AND THAT THE COLOUR HAD FLED FROM HER CHEEKS A FEW MOMENTS LATER
6356-271889-0032 I DISTINGUISHED THE VOICE OF THE SERVANT ANSWERING HER MASTER AND AFTER SOME FURTHER CONVERSATION A MAN EXCLAIMED DOBROI NOTSCHE SOUVAROFF GOOD NIGHT TO THIS THE MAN ADDRESSED REPLIED IN A CHEERY TONE THE FRONT DOOR SLAMMED
6356-271889-0033 AND MY HOST RETURNED INTO THE ROOM AS HE ENTERED HE UTTERED SOME WORDS IN POLISH PATOIS TO HIS DAUGHTER IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ANNOUNCEMENT OF A STARTLING CHARACTER FOR UTTERING AN EJACULATION OF ALARM SHE REELED AND ALMOST FELL IN A MOMENT HOWEVER
6356-271889-0034 SHE HAD RECOVERED HERSELF AND SANK INTO AN ARMCHAIR IN A GRAVE DEJECTED ATTITUDE ALL THE LIGHT HAD LEFT HER FACE AND WITH HER CHIN RESTING UPON HER BREAST SHE GAZED DOWN IN THOUGHTFUL SILENCE UPON THE ROSETTES
6356-271889-0035 ON HER LITTLE MOROCCO SLIPPERS SOUVAROFF APPEARED TO HAVE AGED TEN YEARS SINCE HE LEFT THE ROOM HALF AN HOUR BEFORE AND ALTHOUGH I ENDEAVOURED TO RESUME OUR CONVERSATION HE ONLY REPLIED IN MONOSYLLABLES
6356-271889-0036 I MARVELLED AT THIS SUDDEN CHANGE EVEN IF AN UNWELCOME VISITOR HAD CALLED I COULD SEE NO REASON WHY SUCH A STRANGE EFFECT SHOULD BE PRODUCED I REMAINED TO SUPPER AFTER WHICH PRASCOVIE THREW A SHAWL ABOUT HER SHOULDERS AND WALKED WITH ME TO THE GATE
6356-271889-0037 I EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO CALL AGAIN AND SPEND ANOTHER EVENING IN LISTENING TO THE PASSIONATE CAUCAUSIAN SONGS BUT SHE APPEARED STRANGELY INDIFFERENT SHE MERELY WISHED ME PROSTCHAI VERY FORMALLY
6356-271889-0038 THEN I TURNED AWAY AND THE GATE WAS LOCKED BEHIND ME SLOWLY I WALKED ALONG THE DESERTED ROAD ABSORBED IN THOUGHT THE NIGHT WAS BRIGHT AND FROSTY AND THERE WAS NO SOUND SAVE THE ECHO OF MY OWN FOOTSTEPS
6356-271889-0039 I HAD BEEN STROLLING ALONG FOR PERHAPS FIVE MINUTES
6356-271889-0040 THE THOROUGHFARE WAS VERY INADEQUATELY LIT INDEED SO DARK WAS IT THAT I WAS UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE NATURE OF THE OBSTACLE BENDING DOWN I PASSED MY HANDS RAPIDLY OVER IT I FOUND IT WAS A MAN
6356-271889-0041 HE WAS EVIDENTLY DRUNK THEREFORE I RESORTED TO THE EXPEDIENT OF GIVING HIM A GENTLE BUT FIRM KICK IN THE RIBS AT THE SAME TIME URGING HIM TO WAKE UP THIS HOWEVER HAD NO EFFECT
6356-271889-0042 THEREFORE AFTER REPEATED EFFORTS TO ROUSE HIM I STRUCK A VESTA AND HELD IT CLOSE TO HIS HEAD THE MOMENT I SAW THE YELLOW PALLOR OF THE FACE AND LOOK OF UNUTTERABLE HORROR IN THE GLAZING EYES
6356-271889-0043 I KNEW THE TRUTH HE WAS DEAD HIS AGE WAS NOT MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE HE HAD GREY EYES FAIR HAIR AND BEARD
6356-271889-0044 AND FROM HIS DRESS I JUDGED THAT HE BELONGED TO THE UPPER CLASS THE HEAVY OVERCOAT HE WORE WAS UNBUTTONED AND A SILK MUFFLER WAS WRAPPED LIGHTLY AROUND HIS THROAT A GLANCE SUFFICED TO ASCERTAIN THAT HE WAS
6356-271889-0045 AND A DOCTOR RESIDING IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAVING MADE AN EXAMINATION AND PRONOUNCED LIFE EXTINCT THE REMAINS WERE CONVEYED TO THE MORTUARY OWING TO THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR AND THE QUIETNESS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
6356-271889-0046 THERE WAS NO CROWD OF CURIOUS ONLOOKERS NOR WAS THERE ANYTHING TO CREATE HORROR FOR NO MARKS OF VIOLENCE COULD BE DISCOVERED ON THE BODY AT THE INQUEST DULY HELD I ATTENDED AND GAVE EVIDENCE
6356-271889-0047 THE MEDICAL TESTIMONY WENT TO SHOW THAT THE UNKNOWN MAN HAD DIED SUDDENLY OWING TO AN AFFECTION OF THE HEART AND THE JURY RETURNED A VERDICT OF DEATH FROM NATURAL CAUSES NOTHING WAS DISCOVERED IN THE POCKETS
6356-271889-0048 WHICH COULD LEAD TO THE UNFORTUNATE MAN'S IDENTIFICATION AND ALTHOUGH HIS DESCRIPTION WAS CIRCULATED BY THE POLICE THE BODY WAS BURIED THREE DAYS LATER IN A NAMELESS GRAVE I HAD PUBLISHED THE STRANGE OBITUARY NOTICE SOUVAROFF HAD GIVEN ME
6356-271889-0049 AND ON THE DAY OF THE INQUEST I AGAIN CALLED AT SPRINGFIELD LODGE
6356-271889-0050 I HAD A PLEASANT TETE A TETE WITH THE FAIR RUSSIAN AND AS WE SAT TOGETHER I COMMENCED TO RELATE MY DISCOVERY ON THE NIGHT OF MY PREVIOUS VISIT AH SHE EXCLAIMED INTERRUPTING ME YOU NEED NOT TELL ME I
6356-271889-0051 I'M SO ANXIOUS TO KNOW THE VERDICT I TOLD HER AND AN EXCLAMATION OF RELIEF INVOLUNTARILY ESCAPED HER THIS DID NOT STRIKE ME AS PECULIAR AT THE TIME
6356-271889-0052 AND WAS MUCH PUZZLED AT ITS SIGNIFICANCE DO THEY KNOW HIS NAME SHE ASKED EAGERLY NO THERE WAS NOTHING TO SERVE AS A CLUE TO HIS IDENTITY POOR FELLOW SHE SIGHED SYMPATHETICALLY I WONDER WHO HE WAS
6356-271889-0053 THEN OUR CONVERSATION TURNED UPON OTHER TOPICS WE SMOKED SEVERAL CIGARETTES AND AFTER REMAINING AN HOUR I BADE HER ADIEU AND DEPARTED
