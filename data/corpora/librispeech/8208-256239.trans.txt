8208-256239-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE NEXT DAY RAMESES SENT HIS BLACK MEN WITH COMMANDS TO MEMPHIS AND ABOUT MIDDAY CAME A GREAT BOAT TOWARD SARAH'S HOUSE FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE CITY
8208-256239-0001 WHEN A SECOND MESSENGER FROM THE PRINCE DETAINED THEM HE COMMANDED THE SOLDIERS TO REMAIN AT THE SHORE AND SUMMONED ONLY THEIR LEADER PATROKLES THEY HALTED AND STOOD WITHOUT MOVEMENT
8208-256239-0002 LIKE TWO ROWS OF COLUMNS COVERED WITH GLITTERING ARMOR AFTER THE MESSENGER WENT PATROKLES IN A HELMET WITH PLUMES WEARING A PURPLE TUNIC OVER WHICH HE HAD GILDED ARMOR ORNAMENTED ON THE BREAST WITH THE PICTURE OF A WOMAN'S HEAD BRISTLING WITH SERPENTS INSTEAD OF HAIR
8208-256239-0003 TELL THE GREEK WARRIORS THAT I WILL NOT REVIEW THEM UNTIL THEIR LORD HIS HOLINESS
8208-256239-0004 THEY HAVE LOST THAT HONOR BY UTTERING IN DRAMSHOPS SHOUTS WORTHY OF DRUNKARDS THESE SHOUTS OFFEND ME I CALL ATTENTION ALSO TO THIS WORTHINESS THAT THE GREEK REGIMENTS DO NOT SHOW SUFFICIENT DISCIPLINE
8208-256239-0005 IN PUBLIC PLACES THE SOLDIERS OF THIS CORPS DISCUSS POLITICS AND A CERTAIN POSSIBLE WAR THIS LOOKS LIKE TREASON TO THE STATE ONLY THE PHARAOH AND MEMBERS OF HIS SUPREME COUNCIL MAY SPEAK OF SUCH MATTERS BUT WE
8208-256239-0006 SOLDIERS AND SERVANTS OF OUR LORD WHATEVER POSITION WE OCCUPY MAY ONLY EXECUTE THE COMMANDS OF OUR MOST GRACIOUS RULER AND BE SILENT AT ALL TIMES I BEG THEE TO COMMUNICATE THESE CONSIDERATIONS TO MY REGIMENTS AND I WISH ALL SUCCESS TO THEE WORTHINESS
8208-256239-0007 IT WILL BE AS COMMANDED WORTHINESS
8208-256239-0008 HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND STANDING ERECT MOVED WITH A RATTLE TOWARD THE BOAT HE KNEW ABOUT THESE DISCUSSIONS OF THE SOLDIERS IN THE DRAMSHOPS AND UNDERSTOOD STRAIGHTWAY THAT SOMETHING DISAGREEABLE HAD HAPPENED TO THE HEIR WHOM THE TROOPS WORSHIPPED
8208-256239-0009 AND HENS WILL LAY EGGS IN YOUR HELMETS SUCH IS THE FATE WAITING FOR STUPID SOLDIERS WHO KNOW NOT HOW TO KEEP THEIR TONGUES QUIET AND NOW TO THE LEFT TO THE REAR TURN AND MARCH TO THE BOAT MAY THE PLAGUE STRIKE YOU
8208-256239-0010 AND COMMANDED THEM TO SING THE SONG OF THAT PRIEST'S DAUGHTER WHO SO LOVED SOLDIERS THAT SHE PUT A DOLL IN HER BED AND PASSED THE WHOLE NIGHT IN THE BOOTH OF THE SENTRIES KEEPING TIME TO THIS SONG THEY ALWAYS MARCHED BEST AND MOVED THE OARS WITH MOST NIMBLENESS
8208-256239-0011 IN THE EVENING ANOTHER BOAT APPROACHED SARAH'S DWELLING OUT OF WHICH CAME THE CHIEF STEWARD OF THE PRINCE'S PROPERTY RAMESES RECEIVED THIS OFFICIAL AT THE GARDEN GATE ALSO PERHAPS HE DID THIS THROUGH STERNNESS
8208-256239-0012 OR PERHAPS NOT TO CONSTRAIN THE MAN TO ENTER THE HOUSE OF HIS MISTRESS AND A JEWESS I WISHED SAID THE HEIR TO SEE THEE AND TO SAY THAT AMONG MY PEOPLE CERTAIN IMPROPER CONVERSATIONS CIRCULATE CONCERNING DECREASE OF RENT
8208-256239-0013 OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND I WISH THOSE PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT I WILL NOT DECREASE RENTS BUT SHOULD ANY MAN IN SPITE OF WARNINGS PERSIST IN HIS FOLLY AND TALK ABOUT RENTS HE WILL RECEIVE BLOWS OF CANES PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER IF HE PAID A LINE
8208-256239-0014 AN UTEN OR A DRACHMA WHATEVER IS COMMANDED WORTHINESS SAID THE CHIEF STEWARD YES BUT THE WORST OFFENDER MIGHT BE BEATEN I MAKE BOLD TO OFFER A REMARK WORTHINESS SAID THE STEWARD IN A LOW TONE INCLINING CONTINUALLY
8208-256239-0015 THAT THE EARTH WORKERS ROUSED BY SOME UNKNOWN PERSON REALLY DID TALK FOR A TIME ABOUT DECREASE OF RENT BUT SOME DAYS AGO THEY CEASED ON A SUDDEN IN THAT CASE WE MIGHT WITHHOLD THE BLOWS OF CANES SAID RAMESES UNLESS AS PREVENTIVE MEANS PUT IN THE STEWARD
8208-256239-0016 WE SHALL NEVER LACK ARTICLES OF THAT SORT BUT WITH MODERATION IN EVERY CASE I DO NOT WISH IT TO GO TO HIS HOLINESS THAT I TORTURE MEN WITHOUT NEED FOR REBELLIOUS CONVERSATION WE MUST BEAT AND TAKE FINES IN MONEY
8208-256239-0017 BUT WHEN THERE IS NO CAUSE FOR PUNISHMENT WE MAY BE MAGNANIMOUS I UNDERSTAND
8208-256239-0018 LET THEM CRY OUT AS MUCH AS THEY LIKE IF THEY DO NOT WHISPER BLASPHEMY THESE TALKS WITH PATROKLES AND THE STEWARD WERE REPORTED THROUGHOUT EGYPT AFTER THE STEWARD'S DEPARTURE THE PRINCE YAWNED AND LOOKING AROUND WITH A TIRED GLANCE
8208-256239-0019 HE SAID TO HIMSELF I HAVE DONE ALL I COULD BUT NOW IF I CAN I WILL DO NOTHING AT THAT MOMENT FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE OUTHOUSES LOW GROANS AND THE SOUND OF FREQUENT BLOWS REACHED THE PRINCE RAMESES TURNED HIS HEAD
8208-256239-0020 SON OF REUBEN WAS BEATING SOME SUBORDINATE WITH A CANE PACIFYING HIM MEANWHILE BE QUIET BE SILENT LOW BEAST THE BEATEN WORKMAN LYING ON THE GROUND CLOSED HIS MOUTH WITH HIS HAND SO AS NOT TO CRY
8208-256239-0021 AT FIRST THE PRINCE RUSHED LIKE A PANTHER TOWARD THE OUTHOUSES SUDDENLY HE HALTED WHAT AM I TO DO WHISPERED HE THIS IS SARAH'S PLACE AND THE JEW IS HER RELATIVE HE BIT HIS LIPS
8208-256239-0022 AND DISAPPEARED AMONG THE TREES THE MORE READILY SINCE THE FLOGGING WAS FINISHED IS THIS THE MANAGEMENT OF THE HUMBLE JEWS THOUGHT RAMESES IS THIS THE WAY THAT MAN LOOKS AT ME AS A FRIGHTENED DOG MIGHT BUT HE BEATS THE WORKMEN
8208-256239-0023 ARE THE HEBREWS ALL LIKE HIM AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THE THOUGHT WAS ROUSED IN THE PRINCE'S SOUL THAT UNDER THE GUISE OF KINDNESS SARAH TOO MIGHT CONCEAL FALSEHOOD CERTAIN CHANGES HAD INDEED TAKEN PLACE IN SARAH
8208-256239-0024 AND HEIR TO THE THRONE OF EGYPT WHEN TUTMOSIS BARGAINED WITH GIDEON TO TAKE HER TO THE PRINCE'S HOUSE SARAH FELL INTO A STATE OF BEWILDERMENT SHE WOULD NOT RENOUNCE RAMESES FOR ANY TREASURE NOR AT THE COST OF LIFE
8208-256239-0025 BUT ONE COULD NOT SAY THAT SHE LOVED HIM AT THAT TIME LOVE DEMANDS FREEDOM AND TIME TO GIVE FORTH ITS MOST BEAUTIFUL BLOSSOMS NEITHER FREEDOM NOR TIME HAD BEEN LEFT TO HER SHE MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE PRINCE ON A CERTAIN DAY
8208-256239-0026 THE FOLLOWING DAY THEY TOOK HER AWAY ALMOST WITHOUT CONSULTING HER WISHES AND BORE HER TO THAT VILLA OPPOSITE MEMPHIS IN A COUPLE OF DAYS SHE BECAME THE PRINCE'S FAVORITE ASTONISHED FRIGHTENED NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE WITH HER
8208-256239-0027 MOREOVER BEFORE SHE COULD MAKE HERSELF USED TO THE NEW IMPRESSIONS THE JEWESS WAS DISTURBED BY ILL WILL FROM SURROUNDING PEOPLE THEN THE VISIT OF UNKNOWN LADIES
8208-256239-0028 THAT ATTACK ON THE VILLA THEN BECAUSE RAMESES TOOK HER PART AND WISHED TO RUSH ON THE RIOTERS SHE WAS STILL MORE TERRIFIED SHE LOST PRESENCE OF MIND AT THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS IN THE HANDS OF A MAN OF SUCH POWER
8208-256239-0029 AND SO VIOLENT WHO IF IT SUITED HIM HAD THE RIGHT TO SHED BLOOD TO SLAY PEOPLE SARAH FELL INTO DESPAIR FOR THE MOMENT IT SEEMED TO HER THAT SHE WOULD GO MAD
8208-256239-0030 SHE HEARD THE TERRIBLE COMMANDS OF THE PRINCE WHO SUMMONED THE SERVANTS TO ARMS BUT AT THAT VERY MOMENT A SLIGHT THING TOOK PLACE ONE LITTLE WORD WAS HEARD WHICH SOBERED SARAH AND GAVE A NEW TURN TO HER FEELINGS THE PRINCE
8208-256239-0031 THINKING THAT SHE WAS WOUNDED DREW THE BANDAGE FROM HER HEAD BUT WHEN HE SAW THE BRUISE HE CRIED THAT IS ONLY A BLUE SPOT HOW THAT BLUE SPOT CHANGES THE FACE AT THESE WORDS SARAH FORGOT PAIN AND FEAR NEW ALARM SEIZED HER
8208-256239-0032 SO SHE HAD CHANGED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT IT ASTONISHED THE PRINCE BUT HE WAS ONLY ASTONISHED THE BLUE SPOT DISAPPEARED IN A COUPLE OF DAYS BUT FEELINGS UNKNOWN UP TO THAT TIME REMAINED IN SARAH'S SOUL AND INCREASED THERE
8208-256239-0033 HIS FAITHFUL SERVANT HIS DEVOTED SLAVE AS INSEPARABLE AS HIS SHADOW BUT AT THE SAME TIME SHE DESIRED THAT HE AT LEAST WHEN HE FONDLED HER SHOULD NOT TREAT HER AS THOUGH HE WERE LORD AND MASTER SHE WAS HIS INDEED
8208-256239-0034 BUT HE WAS HERS ALSO WHY DOES HE NOT SHOW THEN THAT HE BELONGED TO HER EVEN IN SOME DEGREE BUT WITH EVERY WORD AND MOTION
8208-256239-0035 WHAT KIND OF GULF HAS SHE NOT HELD HIM IN HER EMBRACES HAS HE NOT KISSED HER LIPS AND BOSOM A CERTAIN DAY THE PRINCE CAME TO HER WITH A DOG HE STAYED ONLY A COUPLE OF HOURS
8208-256239-0036 BUT DURING THAT ENTIRE INTERVAL THE DOG LAY AT HIS FEET IN SARAH'S PLACE AND WHEN SHE WISHED TO SIT THERE THE DOG GROWLED AND THE PRINCE LAUGHED
8208-256239-0037 AS HE HAD INTO HER HAIR AND THE DOG LOOKED INTO THE PRINCE'S EYES JUST AS SHE HAD WITH THIS DIFFERENCE PERHAPS THAT HE LOOKED WITH MORE CONFIDENCE SHE COULD NOT PACIFY HERSELF AND SHE HATED THE CLEVER BEAST WHICH WAS TAKING A PART OF THE TENDERNESS DUE TO HER
8208-256239-0038 NOT LONG BEFORE THIS INCIDENT THE PRINCE MENTIONED DANCERS A SECOND TIME THEN SARAH BURST OUT ANGRILY HOW DID HE PERMIT HIMSELF TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THOSE NAKED SHAMELESS WOMEN AND JEHOVAH LOOKING DOWN FROM HIGH HEAVEN
8208-256239-0039 DID NOT HURL HIS THUNDERS AT THOSE MONSTROUS CREATURES IT IS TRUE THAT RAMESES TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS DEARER THAN ALL ELSE TO HIM BUT THESE WORDS DID NOT PACIFY SARAH THEY ONLY PRODUCED THIS EFFECT
8208-256239-0040 THAT SHE DETERMINED NOT TO THINK OF AUGHT BEYOND HER LOVE WHAT WOULD COME ON THE MORROW NEVER MIND AND WHEN AT THE FEET OF THE PRINCE SHE SANG THAT HYMN ABOUT THOSE SUFFERINGS WHICH PURSUE MANKIND FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE
8208-256239-0041 AND HER LAST HOPE WHICH WAS JEHOVAH THAT DAY RAMESES WAS WITH HER HENCE SHE HAD ENOUGH SHE HAD ALL THE HAPPINESS WHICH LIFE COULD GIVE BUT JUST THERE BEGAN FOR SARAH THE GREATEST BITTERNESS
8208-256239-0042 THE PRINCE LIVED UNDER ONE ROOF WITH HER HE WALKED WITH HER IN THE GARDEN AND SOMETIMES WENT OUT ON THE NILE IN A BOAT WITH HER BUT HE WAS NOT MORE ACCESSIBLE BY THE WIDTH OF ONE HAIR THAN WHEN HE WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER
8208-256239-0043 WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE PHARAOH'S PALACE HE WAS WITH HER BUT HIS MIND WAS IN SOME OTHER PLACE SARAH COULD NOT EVEN DIVINE WHERE HE EMBRACED HER OR TOYED WITH HER HAIR BUT HE LOOKED TOWARD THE CITY
8208-256239-0044 AT THOSE IMMENSE MANY COLORED PYLONS OF THE PHARAOH'S PALACE OR AT SOME UNKNOWN OBJECT
