7307-91998-0000 PROBABLY ONE NIGHT ONLY BUT I WON'T MAKE ANY PROMISE GEORGE HAD SAID TO MADAME FARAGON WHEN SHE ASKED HIM HOW LONG HE INTENDED TO STAY AT GRANPERE AS HE TOOK ONE OF THE HORSES BELONGING TO THE INN AND DROVE HIMSELF
7307-91998-0001 IT SEEMED TO BE CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD NOT STAY LONG HE STARTED ALL ALONE EARLY IN THE MORNING AND REACHED GRANPERE ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK HIS MIND WAS FULL OF PAINFUL THOUGHTS AS HE WENT
7307-91998-0002 AND AS THE LITTLE ANIMAL RAN QUICKLY DOWN THE MOUNTAIN ROAD INTO THE VALLEY IN WHICH GRANPERE LIES HE ALMOST WISHED THAT HIS FEET WERE NOT SO FLEET
7307-91998-0003 AND TO WHOM WAS HE TO SAY IT WHEN HE REACHED THE ANGULAR COURT ALONG TWO SIDES OF WHICH THE HOUSE WAS BUILT HE DID NOT AT ONCE ENTER THE FRONT DOOR NONE OF THE FAMILY WERE THEN ABOUT THE PLACE
7307-91998-0004 AND HE COULD THEREFORE GO INTO THE STABLE AND ASK A QUESTION OR TWO OF THE MAN WHO CAME TO MEET HIM HIS FATHER THE MAN TOLD HIM HAD GONE UP EARLY TO THE WOOD CUTTING AND WOULD NOT PROBABLY RETURN TILL THE AFTERNOON
7307-91998-0005 MADAME VOSS WAS NO DOUBT INSIDE AS WAS ALSO MARIE BROMAR THEN THE MAN COMMENCED AN ELABORATE ACCOUNT OF THE BETROTHALS THERE NEVER HAD BEEN AT GRANPERE ANY MARRIAGE THAT HAD BEEN HALF SO IMPORTANT AS WOULD BE THIS MARRIAGE
7307-91998-0006 NO LOVER COMING THITHER HAD EVER BEEN BLESSED WITH SO BEAUTIFUL AND DISCREET A MAIDEN AND NO MAIDEN OF GRANPERE HAD EVER BEFORE HAD AT HER FEET A LOVER AT THE SAME TIME SO GOOD LOOKING SO WEALTHY SO SAGACIOUS AND SO GOOD TEMPERED
7307-91998-0007 THE MAN DECLARED THAT ADRIAN WAS THE LUCKIEST FELLOW IN THE WORLD IN FINDING SUCH A WIFE BUT HIS ENTHUSIASM ROSE TO THE HIGHEST PITCH WHEN HE SPOKE OF MARIE'S LUCK IN FINDING SUCH A HUSBAND THERE WAS NO END TO THE GOOD WITH WHICH SHE WOULD BE ENDOWED
7307-91998-0008 GEORGE LISTENED TO IT ALL AND SMILED AND SAID A WORD OR TWO WAS IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO COME ALL THE WAY TO GRANPERE TO THROW HIS THUNDERBOLT AT A GIRL WHO HAD BEEN CAPTIVATED BY PROMISES OF A CHEST FULL OF HOUSE LINEN
7307-91998-0009 GEORGE TOLD THE MAN THAT HE WOULD GO UP TO THE WOOD CUTTING AFTER HIS FATHER BUT BEFORE HE WAS OUT OF THE COURT HE CHANGED HIS MIND AND SLOWLY ENTERED THE HOUSE WHY SHOULD HE GO TO HIS FATHER WHAT HAD HE TO SAY TO HIS FATHER ABOUT THE MARRIAGE
7307-91998-0010 THAT COULD NOT BE BETTER SAID DOWN AT THE HOUSE AFTER ALL HE HAD BUT LITTLE GROUND OF COMPLAINT AGAINST HIS FATHER IT WAS MARIE WHO HAD BEEN UNTRUE TO HIM AND IT WAS ON MARIE'S HEAD THAT HIS WRATH MUST FALL
7307-91998-0011 BUT HE NEED NOT TELL HIS FATHER THE ERRAND ON WHICH HE HAD COME SO HE CHANGED HIS MIND AND WENT INTO THE INN HE ENTERED THE HOUSE ALMOST DREADING TO SEE HER WHOM HE WAS SEEKING
7307-91998-0012 IN WHAT WAY SHOULD HE FIRST EXPRESS HIS WRATH HOW SHOULD HE SHOW HER THE WRECK WHICH BY HER INCONSTANCY SHE HAD MADE OF HIS HAPPINESS HIS FIRST WORDS MUST IF POSSIBLE BE SPOKEN TO HER ALONE AND YET ALONE HE COULD HARDLY HOPE TO FIND HER
7307-91998-0013 AND HE FEARED HER THOUGH HE WAS SO RESOLVED TO SPEAK HIS MIND YET HE FEARED HER
7307-91998-0014 YET HE DREADED THE EFFECT OF HER WORDS UPON HIMSELF HE KNEW HOW STRONG SHE COULD BE AND HOW STEADFAST THOUGH HIS PASSION TOLD HIM EVERY HOUR WAS TELLING HIM ALL DAY LONG THAT SHE WAS AS FALSE AS HELL YET THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIM OF JUDGMENT
7307-91998-0015 WHICH TOLD HIM ALSO THAT SHE WAS NOT BAD THAT SHE WAS A FIRM HEARTED HIGH SPIRITED GREAT MINDED GIRL WHO WOULD HAVE REASONS TO GIVE FOR THE THING THAT SHE WAS DOING
7307-91998-0016 HE WENT THROUGH INTO THE KITCHEN BEFORE HE MET ANY ONE AND THERE HE FOUND MADAME VOSS WITH THE COOK AND PETER IMMEDIATE EXPLANATIONS HAD OF COURSE TO BE MADE AS TO HIS UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL QUESTIONS ASKED AND SUGGESTIONS OFFERED
7307-91998-0017 HAD HE COME BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD OF THE BETROTHALS HE ADMITTED THAT IT WAS SO
7307-91998-0018 I WILL CONGRATULATE HER CERTAINLY SAID GEORGE THEN THE COOK AND PETER BEGAN WITH A COPIOUS FLOW OF DOMESTIC ELOQUENCE
7307-91998-0019 HOW PLEASING TO THE MASTER HOW CREDITABLE TO THE VILLAGE HOW SATISFACTORY TO THE FRIENDS HOW JOYOUS TO THE BRIDEGROOM HOW TRIUMPHANT TO THE BRIDE NO DOUBT SHE WILL HAVE PLENTY TO EAT AND DRINK AND FINE CLOTHES TO WEAR
7307-91998-0020 SAID GEORGE IN HIS BITTERNESS AND SHE WILL BE MARRIED TO ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTABLE YOUNG MEN IN ALL SWITZERLAND SAID MADAME VOSS IN A TONE OF MUCH ANGER
7307-91998-0021 THAT GEORGE HAD NOT COME OVER FROM COLMAR SIMPLY TO EXPRESS HIS JOYOUS SATISFACTION AT HIS COUSIN'S GOOD FORTUNE HE SOON WALKED THROUGH INTO THE LITTLE SITTING ROOM AND HIS STEP MOTHER FOLLOWED HIM GEORGE SHE SAID
7307-91998-0022 YOU WILL DISPLEASE YOUR FATHER VERY MUCH IF YOU SAY ANYTHING UNKIND ABOUT MARIE I KNOW VERY WELL SAID HE THAT MY FATHER CARES MORE FOR MARIE THAN HE DOES FOR ME THAT IS NOT SO GEORGE
7307-91998-0023 I DO NOT BLAME HIM FOR IT SHE LIVES IN THE HOUSE WITH HIM WHILE I LIVE ELSEWHERE IT WAS NATURAL THAT SHE SHOULD BE MORE TO HIM THAN I AM
7307-91998-0024 BUT HE HAS NO RIGHT TO SUPPOSE THAT I CAN HAVE THE SAME FEELING THAT HE HAS ABOUT THIS MARRIAGE I CANNOT THINK IT THE FINEST THING IN THE WORLD FOR ALL OF US
7307-91998-0025 HE IS A MOST INDUSTRIOUS YOUNG MAN WHO THOROUGHLY UNDERSTANDS HIS BUSINESS I HAVE HEARD PEOPLE SAY THAT THERE IS NO ONE COMES TO GRANPERE WHO CAN BUY BETTER THAN HE CAN VERY LIKELY NOT
7307-91998-0026 BUT NEVER MIND IT IS NO USE TALKING ABOUT IT WORDS WON'T MEND IT
7307-91998-0027 BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE MY FATHER THEN HE REMEMBERED HOW FALSE WAS THIS EXCUSE AND REMEMBERED ALSO HOW SOON ITS FALSENESS WOULD APPEAR BESIDES THOUGH I DO NOT LIKE THIS MATCH I WISH TO SEE MARIE ONCE AGAIN BEFORE HER MARRIAGE
7307-91998-0028 I SHALL NEVER SEE HER AFTER IT THAT IS THE REASON WHY I HAVE COME I SUPPOSE YOU CAN GIVE ME A BED O YES THERE ARE BEDS ENOUGH AFTER THAT THERE WAS SOME PAUSE AND MADAME VOSS HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TREAT HER STEP SON
7307-91998-0029 AT LAST SHE ASKED HIM WHETHER HE WOULD HAVE DINNER
7307-91998-0030 AND GEORGE ASKED AFTER THE CHILDREN AND IN THIS WAY THE DREADED SUBJECT WAS FOR SOME MINUTES LAID ON ONE SIDE IN THE MEAN TIME INFORMATION OF GEORGE'S ARRIVAL HAD BEEN TAKEN UPSTAIRS TO MARIE
7307-91998-0031 SHE HAD OFTEN WONDERED WHAT SIGN HE WOULD MAKE WHEN HE SHOULD HEAR OF HER ENGAGEMENT WOULD HE SEND HER A WORD OF AFFECTION OR SUCH CUSTOMARY PRESENT AS WOULD BE USUAL BETWEEN TWO PERSONS SO NEARLY CONNECTED
7307-91998-0032 AND WHAT WOULD BE HIS OWN FEELINGS SHE TOO REMEMBERED WELL WITH ABSOLUTE ACCURACY THOSE WARM DELICIOUS HEAVENLY WORDS OF LOVE WHICH HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM SHE COULD FEEL NOW THE PRESSURE OF HIS HAND AND THE WARMTH OF HIS KISS
7307-91998-0033 WHEN SHE SWORE TO HIM THAT SHE WOULD BE HIS FOR EVER AND EVER AFTER THAT HE HAD LEFT HER
7307-91998-0034 THEN HE HAD COME AGAIN AND HAD SIMPLY ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WERE ENGAGED TO ANOTHER MAN HAD ASKED WITH A CRUEL INDICATION THAT HE AT LEAST INTENDED THAT THE OLD CHILDISH WORDS SHOULD BE FORGOTTEN NOW HE WAS IN THE HOUSE AGAIN AND SHE WOULD HAVE TO HEAR HIS CONGRATULATIONS
7307-91998-0035 SHE THOUGHT FOR SOME QUARTER OF AN HOUR WHAT SHE HAD BETTER DO AND THEN SHE DETERMINED TO GO DOWN TO HIM AT ONCE THE SOONER THE FIRST MEETING WAS OVER THE BETTER WERE SHE TO REMAIN AWAY FROM HIM TILL THEY SHOULD BE BROUGHT TOGETHER AT THE SUPPER TABLE
7307-91998-0036 THERE WOULD ALMOST BE A NECESSITY FOR HER TO EXPLAIN HER CONDUCT SHE WOULD GO DOWN TO HIM AND TREAT HIM EXACTLY AS SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE HAD THERE NEVER BEEN ANY SPECIAL LOVE BETWEEN THEM SHE WOULD DO SO AS PERFECTLY AS HER STRENGTH MIGHT ENABLE HER
7307-91998-0037 THAN IN THE PRESENCE OF HER UNCLE WHEN SHE HAD RESOLVED SHE WAITED YET ANOTHER MINUTE OR TWO AND THEN SHE WENT DOWN STAIRS AS SHE ENTERED HER AUNT'S ROOM GEORGE VOSS WAS SITTING BEFORE THE STOVE WHILE MADAME VOSS WAS IN HER ACCUSTOMED CHAIR
7307-91998-0038 AND PETER WAS PREPARING THE TABLE FOR HIS YOUNG MASTER'S DINNER GEORGE AROSE FROM HIS SEAT AT ONCE AND THEN CAME A LOOK OF PAIN ACROSS HIS FACE
7307-91998-0039 SHE SAID I AM SO GLAD THAT YOU HAVE COME SHE HAD OFFERED HIM HER HAND AND OF COURSE HE HAD TAKEN IT YES HE SAID I THOUGHT IT BEST JUST TO RUN OVER WE SHALL BE VERY BUSY AT THE HOTEL BEFORE LONG
7307-91998-0040 DOES THAT MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT TO BE HERE FOR MY MARRIAGE THIS SHE SAID WITH HER SWEETEST SMILE MAKING ALL THE EFFORT IN HER POWER TO GIVE A GRACIOUS TONE TO HER VOICE IT WAS BETTER SHE KNEW TO PLUNGE AT THE SUBJECT AT ONCE NO
7307-91998-0041 SAID HE I SHALL NOT BE HERE THEN AH YOUR FATHER WILL MISS YOU SO MUCH BUT IF IT CANNOT BE IT IS VERY GOOD OF YOU TO COME NOW
7307-91998-0042 AND THOUGH COLMAR AND BASLE ARE VERY NEAR
7307-91998-0043 THERE WAS A TOUCH ABOUT HER VOICE AS SHE CALLED HIM BY HIS NAME THAT NEARLY KILLED HIM AT THAT MOMENT HIS HATRED WAS STRONGEST AGAINST ADRIAN WHY HAD SUCH AN UPSTART AS THAT A PUNY MISERABLE CREATURE
7307-91998-0044 COME BETWEEN HIM AND THE ONLY THING THAT HE HAD EVER SEEN IN THE GUISE OF A WOMAN THAT COULD TOUCH HIS HEART HE TURNED ROUND WITH HIS BACK TO THE TABLE AND HIS FACE TO THE STOVE AND SAID NOTHING BUT HE WAS ABLE WHEN HE NO LONGER SAW HER WHEN HER VOICE WAS NOT SOUNDING IN HIS EAR
7307-91998-0045 TO SWEAR THAT THE THUNDERBOLT SHOULD BE HURLED ALL THE SAME HIS JOURNEY TO GRANPERE SHOULD NOT BE MADE FOR NOTHING I MUST GO NOW SHE SAID PRESENTLY I SHALL SEE YOU AT SUPPER SHALL I NOT GEORGE WHEN UNCLE WILL BE WITH US
7307-91998-0046 AND YOU WILL TELL US OF THE NEW DOINGS AT THE HOTEL GOOD BYE FOR THE PRESENT GEORGE THEN SHE WAS GONE BEFORE HE HAD SPOKEN ANOTHER WORD HE EAT HIS DINNER AND SMOKED A CIGAR ABOUT THE YARD
7307-91998-0047 HE DID GO OUT BUT DID NOT TAKE THE ROAD BY WHICH HE KNEW THAT HIS FATHER WAS TO BE FOUND HE STROLLED OFF TO THE RAVINE AND CAME BACK ONLY WHEN IT WAS DARK
