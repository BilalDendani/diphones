716-129581-0000 IN THE EARLY MORNING IT WAS THE SECOND MORNING AFTER MY RECOVERY AND I BELIEVE THE FOURTH AFTER I WAS PICKED UP I AWOKE THROUGH AN AVENUE OF TUMULTUOUS DREAMS DREAMS OF GUNS AND HOWLING MOBS AND BECAME SENSIBLE OF A HOARSE SHOUTING ABOVE ME
716-129581-0001 I RUBBED MY EYES AND LAY LISTENING TO THE NOISE DOUBTFUL FOR A LITTLE WHILE OF MY WHEREABOUTS THEN CAME A SUDDEN PATTERING OF BARE FEET THE SOUND OF HEAVY OBJECTS BEING THROWN ABOUT A VIOLENT CREAKING AND THE RATTLING OF CHAINS
716-129581-0002 I HEARD THE SWISH OF THE WATER AS THE SHIP WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT ROUND AND A FOAMY YELLOW GREEN WAVE FLEW ACROSS THE LITTLE ROUND WINDOW AND LEFT IT STREAMING I JUMPED INTO MY CLOTHES AND WENT ON DECK
716-129581-0003 AS I CAME UP THE LADDER I SAW AGAINST THE FLUSHED SKY FOR THE SUN WAS JUST RISING THE BROAD BACK AND RED HAIR OF THE CAPTAIN AND OVER HIS SHOULDER THE PUMA SPINNING FROM A TACKLE RIGGED ON TO THE MIZZEN SPANKER BOOM THE POOR BRUTE SEEMED HORRIBLY SCARED
716-129581-0004 AND CROUCHED IN THE BOTTOM OF ITS LITTLE CAGE OVERBOARD WITH EM BAWLED THE CAPTAIN OVERBOARD WITH EM
716-129581-0005 HE STOOD IN MY WAY SO THAT I HAD PERFORCE TO TAP HIS SHOULDER TO COME ON DECK HE CAME ROUND WITH A START AND STAGGERED BACK A FEW PACES TO STARE AT ME IT NEEDED NO EXPERT EYE TO TELL THAT THE MAN WAS STILL DRUNK HULLO
716-129581-0006 SAID HE STUPIDLY AND THEN WITH A LIGHT COMING INTO HIS EYES WHY IT'S MISTER MISTER PRENDICK SAID I PRENDICK BE DAMNED SAID HE SHUT UP THAT'S YOUR NAME MISTER SHUT UP
716-129581-0007 IT WAS NO GOOD ANSWERING THE BRUTE BUT I CERTAINLY DID NOT EXPECT HIS NEXT MOVE HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO THE GANGWAY BY WHICH MONTGOMERY STOOD TALKING TO A MASSIVE GREY HAIRED MAN IN DIRTY BLUE FLANNELS WHO HAD APPARENTLY JUST COME ABOARD
716-129581-0008 THAT WAY MISTER BLASTED SHUT UP THAT WAY ROARED THE CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY AND HIS COMPANION TURNED AS HE SPOKE
716-129581-0009 THAT WAY MISTER BLASTED SHUT UP THAT'S WHAT I MEAN OVERBOARD MISTER SHUT UP AND SHARP WE'RE CLEANING THE SHIP OUT
716-129581-0010 AND OVERBOARD YOU GO I STARED AT HIM DUMFOUNDED THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT IT WAS EXACTLY THE THING I WANTED THE LOST PROSPECT OF A JOURNEY AS SOLE PASSENGER WITH THIS QUARRELSOME SOT WAS NOT ONE TO MOURN OVER I TURNED TOWARDS MONTGOMERY
716-129581-0011 CAN'T HAVE YOU SAID MONTGOMERY'S COMPANION CONCISELY YOU CAN'T HAVE ME SAID I AGHAST HE HAD THE SQUAREST AND MOST RESOLUTE FACE I EVER SET EYES UPON
716-129581-0012 LOOK HERE I BEGAN TURNING TO THE CAPTAIN OVERBOARD SAID THE CAPTAIN THIS SHIP AINT FOR BEASTS AND CANNIBALS AND WORSE THAN BEASTS ANY MORE OVERBOARD YOU GO MISTER SHUT UP
716-129581-0013 AMEN I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT BUT MONTGOMERY I APPEALED HE DISTORTED HIS LOWER LIP AND NODDED HIS HEAD HOPELESSLY AT THE GREY HAIRED MAN BESIDE HIM TO INDICATE HIS POWERLESSNESS TO HELP ME I'LL SEE TO YOU PRESENTLY
716-129581-0014 SAID THE CAPTAIN THEN BEGAN A CURIOUS THREE CORNERED ALTERCATION ALTERNATELY I APPEALED TO ONE AND ANOTHER OF THE THREE MEN FIRST TO THE GREY HAIRED MAN TO LET ME LAND AND THEN TO THE DRUNKEN CAPTAIN TO KEEP ME ABOARD
716-129581-0015 I EVEN BAWLED ENTREATIES TO THE SAILORS MONTGOMERY SAID NEVER A WORD ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD YOU'RE GOING OVERBOARD I TELL YOU WAS THE CAPTAIN'S REFRAIN LAW BE DAMNED I'M KING HERE
716-129581-0016 AT LAST I MUST CONFESS MY VOICE SUDDENLY BROKE IN THE MIDDLE OF A VIGOROUS THREAT I FELT A GUST OF HYSTERICAL PETULANCE AND WENT AFT AND STARED DISMALLY AT NOTHING
716-129581-0017 MEANWHILE THE SAILORS PROGRESSED RAPIDLY WITH THE TASK OF UNSHIPPING THE PACKAGES AND CAGED ANIMALS A LARGE LAUNCH WITH TWO STANDING LUGS LAY UNDER THE LEA OF THE SCHOONER AND INTO THIS THE STRANGE ASSORTMENT OF GOODS WERE SWUNG
716-129581-0018 FOR THE HULL OF THE LAUNCH WAS HIDDEN FROM ME BY THE SIDE OF THE SCHOONER NEITHER MONTGOMERY NOR HIS COMPANION TOOK THE SLIGHTEST NOTICE OF ME BUT BUSIED THEMSELVES IN ASSISTING AND DIRECTING THE FOUR OR FIVE SAILORS WHO WERE UNLOADING THE GOODS
716-129581-0019 THE CAPTAIN WENT FORWARD INTERFERING RATHER THAN ASSISTING I WAS ALTERNATELY DESPAIRFUL AND DESPERATE ONCE OR TWICE AS I STOOD WAITING THERE FOR THINGS TO ACCOMPLISH THEMSELVES I COULD NOT RESIST AN IMPULSE TO LAUGH AT MY MISERABLE QUANDARY
716-129581-0020 I FELT ALL THE WRETCHEDER FOR THE LACK OF A BREAKFAST HUNGER AND A LACK OF BLOOD CORPUSCLES TAKE ALL THE MANHOOD FROM A MAN I PERCEIVED PRETTY CLEARLY THAT I HAD NOT THE STAMINA EITHER TO RESIST WHAT THE CAPTAIN CHOSE TO DO TO EXPEL ME
716-129581-0021 OR TO FORCE MYSELF UPON MONTGOMERY AND HIS COMPANION SO I WAITED PASSIVELY UPON FATE
716-129581-0022 AS IF I DID NOT EXIST PRESENTLY THAT WORK WAS FINISHED AND THEN CAME A STRUGGLE I WAS HAULED RESISTING WEAKLY ENOUGH TO THE GANGWAY EVEN THEN I NOTICED THE ODDNESS OF THE BROWN FACES OF THE MEN WHO WERE WITH MONTGOMERY IN THE LAUNCH
716-129581-0023 BUT THE LAUNCH WAS NOW FULLY LADEN AND WAS SHOVED OFF HASTILY A BROADENING GAP OF GREEN WATER APPEARED UNDER ME AND I PUSHED BACK WITH ALL MY STRENGTH TO AVOID FALLING HEADLONG
716-129581-0024 AND THEN THE CAPTAIN THE MATE AND ONE OF THE SEAMEN HELPING HIM RAN ME AFT TOWARDS THE STERN THE DINGEY OF THE LADY VAIN HAD BEEN TOWING BEHIND IT WAS HALF FULL OF WATER HAD NO OARS AND WAS QUITE UNVICTUALLED
716-129581-0025 I REFUSED TO GO ABOARD HER AND FLUNG MYSELF FULL LENGTH ON THE DECK IN THE END THEY SWUNG ME INTO HER BY A ROPE FOR THEY HAD NO STERN LADDER AND THEN THEY CUT ME ADRIFT I DRIFTED SLOWLY FROM THE SCHOONER IN A KIND OF STUPOR I WATCHED ALL HANDS
716-129581-0026 TAKE TO THE RIGGING AND SLOWLY BUT SURELY SHE CAME ROUND TO THE WIND THE SAILS FLUTTERED AND THEN BELLIED OUT AS THE WIND CAME INTO THEM I STARED AT HER WEATHER BEATEN SIDE HEELING STEEPLY TOWARDS ME AND THEN SHE PASSED OUT OF MY RANGE OF VIEW
716-129581-0027 I DID NOT TURN MY HEAD TO FOLLOW HER AT FIRST I COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE WHAT HAD HAPPENED I CROUCHED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE DINGEY STUNNED AND STARING BLANKLY AT THE VACANT OILY SEA THEN I REALISED THAT I WAS IN THAT LITTLE HELL OF MINE AGAIN NOW HALF SWAMPED
716-129581-0028 AND LOOKING BACK OVER THE GUNWALE I SAW THE SCHOONER STANDING AWAY FROM ME WITH THE RED HAIRED CAPTAIN MOCKING AT ME OVER THE TAFFRAIL AND TURNING TOWARDS THE ISLAND SAW THE LAUNCH GROWING SMALLER AS SHE APPROACHED THE BEACH
716-129581-0029 ABRUPTLY THE CRUELTY OF THIS DESERTION BECAME CLEAR TO ME I HAD NO MEANS OF REACHING THE LAND UNLESS I SHOULD CHANCE TO DRIFT THERE
