2361-165622-0000 WHEN HE WAS ARMED HE DESCENDS THE STEPS AND FINDS HIS HORSE SADDLED AND THE KING WHO HAD MOUNTED EVERY ONE IN THE CASTLE AND IN THE HOUSES OF THE TOWN HASTENED TO MOUNT IN ALL THE TOWN THERE REMAINED NEITHER MAN NOR WOMAN
2361-165622-0001 ERECT OR DEFORMED GREAT OR SMALL WEAK OR STRONG WHO IS ABLE TO GO AND DOES NOT DO SO WHEN THEY START THERE IS A GREAT NOISE AND CLAMOUR IN ALL THE STREETS FOR THOSE OF HIGH AND LOW DEGREE ALIKE CRY OUT
2361-165622-0002 ALAS ALAS OH KNIGHT THE JOY THAT THOU WISHEST TO WIN HAS BETRAYED THEE AND THOU GOEST TO WIN BUT GRIEF AND DEATH AND THERE IS NOT ONE BUT SAYS GOD CURSE THIS JOY WHICH HAS BEEN THE DEATH OF SO MANY GENTLEMEN
2361-165622-0003 THAT UP AND DOWN THEY SAID OF HIM ALAS ALAS ILL STARRED WERT THOU FAIR GENTLE SKILFUL KNIGHT SURELY IT WOULD NOT BE JUST THAT THY LIFE SHOULD END SO SOON OR THAT HARM SHOULD COME TO WOUND AND INJURE THEE
2361-165622-0004 HE HEARS CLEARLY THE WORDS AND WHAT THEY SAID BUT NOTWITHSTANDING HE PASSES ON WITHOUT LOWERING HIS HEAD AND WITHOUT THE BEARING OF A CRAVEN WHOEVER MAY SPEAK HE LONGS TO SEE AND KNOW AND UNDERSTAND
2361-165622-0005 WHY THEY ARE ALL IN SUCH DISTRESS ANXIETY AND WOE THE KING LEADS HIM WITHOUT THE TOWN INTO A GARDEN THAT STOOD NEAR BY AND ALL THE PEOPLE FOLLOW AFTER PRAYING THAT FROM THIS TRIAL
2361-165622-0006 FOR WHOEVER SHOULD WISH TO CARRY OUT A LITTLE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND THE GATE AND NEVER COULD ISSUE FROM THE GARDEN UNTIL HE HAD RESTORED THE FRUIT TO ITS PLACE
2361-165622-0007 AND THERE IS NO FLYING BIRD UNDER HEAVEN PLEASING TO MAN BUT IT SINGS THERE TO DELIGHT AND TO GLADDEN HIM AND CAN BE HEARD THERE IN NUMBERS OF EVERY KIND AND THE EARTH HOWEVER FAR IT STRETCH
2361-165622-0008 BEARS NO SPICE OR ROOT OF USE IN MAKING MEDICINE BUT IT HAD BEEN PLANTED THERE AND WAS TO BE FOUND IN ABUNDANCE THROUGH A NARROW ENTRANCE THE PEOPLE ENTERED KING EVRAIN AND ALL THE REST
2361-165622-0009 EREC WENT RIDING LANCE IN REST INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE GARDEN GREATLY DELIGHTING IN THE SONG OF THE BIRDS WHICH WERE SINGING THERE THEY PUT HIM IN MIND OF HIS JOY THE THING HE MOST WAS LONGING FOR
2361-165622-0010 BUT HE SAW A WONDROUS THING WHICH MIGHT AROUSE FEAR IN THE BRAVEST WARRIOR OF ALL WHOM WE KNOW
2361-165622-0011 THE ESCLAVON

2361-165622-0016 NOR CAN YOU GO ALONG WITH ME FOR AS THE KING HAS ORDERED I MUST NOT TAKE YOU BEYOND THIS POINT THEN HE KISSES HER AND COMMENDS HER TO GOD AND SHE HIM
2361-165622-0017 AND GRIEVING AND HE WENT OFF ALONE DOWN A PATH WITHOUT COMPANION OF ANY SORT UNTIL HE CAME TO A SILVER COUCH WITH A COVER OF GOLD EMBROIDERED CLOTH BENEATH THE SHADE OF A SYCAMORE
2361-165622-0018 AND ON THE BED A MAIDEN OF COMELY BODY AND LOVELY FACE COMPLETELY ENDOWED WITH ALL BEAUTY WAS SEATED ALL ALONE I INTENDED TO SAY NO MORE OF HER BUT WHOEVER COULD CONSIDER WELL ALL HER ATTIRE AND HER BEAUTY
2361-165622-0019 MIGHT WELL SAY THAT NEVER DID LAVINIA OF LAURENTUM WHO WAS SO FAIR AND COMELY POSSESS THE QUARTER OF HER BEAUTY EREC DRAWS NEAR TO HER WISHING TO SEE HER MORE CLOSELY AND THE ONLOOKERS GO
2361-165622-0020 AND SIT DOWN UNDER THE TREES IN THE ORCHARD THEN BEHOLD THERE COMES A KNIGHT ARMED WITH VERMILION ARMS AND HE WAS WONDROUS TALL AND IF HE WERE NOT SO IMMEASURABLY TALL UNDER THE HEAVENS THERE WOULD BE NONE FAIRER THAN HE
2361-165622-0021 BEFORE EREC CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM HE CRIED OUT VASSAL VASSAL YOU ARE MAD UPON MY LIFE THUS TO APPROACH MY DAMSEL I SHOULD SAY YOU ARE NOT WORTHY TO DRAW NEAR HER YOU WILL PAY DEARLY FOR YOUR PRESUMPTION
2361-165622-0022 BY MY HEAD STAND BACK AND EREC STOPS AND LOOKS AT HIM AND THE OTHER TOO STOOD STILL NEITHER MADE ADVANCE UNTIL EREC HAD REPLIED ALL THAT HE WISHED TO SAY TO HIM
2361-165622-0023 ONE CAN SPEAK FOLLY AS WELL AS GOOD SENSE THREATEN AS MUCH AS YOU PLEASE AND I WILL KEEP SILENCE
2361-165622-0024 DO YOU KNOW WHY A MAN SOMETIMES THINKS HE HAS WON THE GAME WHO AFTERWARD LOSES IT SO HE IS MANIFESTLY A FOOL WHO IS TOO PRESUMPTUOUS AND WHO THREATENS TOO MUCH
2361-165622-0025 IF THERE ARE SOME WHO FLEE THERE ARE PLENTY WHO CHASE BUT I DO NOT FEAR YOU SO MUCH THAT I AM GOING TO RUN AWAY YET I AM READY TO MAKE SUCH DEFENCE IF THERE IS ANY WHO WISHES TO OFFER ME BATTLE
2361-165622-0026 THAT HE WILL HAVE TO DO HIS UTTERMOST OR OTHERWISE HE CANNOT ESCAPE NAY QUOTH HE SO HELP ME GOD KNOW THAT YOU SHALL HAVE THE BATTLE FOR I DEFY AND CHALLENGE YOU
2361-165622-0027 AND YOU MAY KNOW UPON MY WORD THAT THEN THE REINS WERE NOT HELD IN THE LANCES THEY HAD WERE NOT LIGHT BUT WERE BIG AND SQUARE
2361-165622-0028 UPON THE SHIELDS WITH MIGHTY STRENGTH THEY SMOTE EACH OTHER WITH THEIR SHARP WEAPONS SO THAT A FATHOM OF EACH LANCE PASSES THROUGH THE GLEAMING SHIELDS
2361-165622-0029 SO THEY QUICKLY RISE FOR THEY WERE STRONG AND LITHE THEY STAND ON FOOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GARDEN AND STRAIGHTWAY ATTACK EACH OTHER WITH THEIR GREEN SWORDS OF GERMAN STEEL AND DEAL GREAT WICKED BLOWS UPON THEIR BRIGHT
2361-165622-0030 NO GREATER EFFORTS CAN BE MADE THAN THOSE THEY MAKE IN STRIVING AND TOILING TO INJURE AND WOUND EACH OTHER BOTH FIERCELY SMITE WITH THE GILDED POMMEL AND THE CUTTING EDGE
2361-165622-0031 AND VERY OFTEN THEY MISSED THEIR BLOWS LIKE MEN WHO DID NOT SEE TO WIELD THEIR SWORDS UPON EACH OTHER THEY CAN SCARCELY HARM EACH OTHER NOW
2361-165622-0032 BECAUSE THEIR EYES ARE SO BLINDED THAT THEY COMPLETELY LOSE THEIR SIGHT THEY LET THEIR SHIELDS FALL TO THE GROUND AND SEIZE EACH OTHER ANGRILY EACH PULLS AND DRAGS THE OTHER SO THAT THEY FALL UPON THEIR KNEES
2361-165622-0033 THUS LONG THEY FIGHT UNTIL THE HOUR OF NOON IS PAST AND THE BIG KNIGHT IS SO EXHAUSTED THAT HIS BREATH QUITE FAILS HIM EREC HAS HIM AT HIS MERCY AND PULLS AND DRAGS SO THAT HE BREAKS ALL THE LACING OF HIS HELMET
2361-165622-0034 AND FORCES HIM OVER AT HIS FEET HE FALLS OVER UPON HIS FACE AGAINST EREC'S BREAST AND HAS NOT STRENGTH TO RISE AGAIN THOUGH IT DISTRESSES HIM HE HAS TO SAY AND OWN I CANNOT DENY IT

2361-165622-0061 IT SEEMED THAT SHE HAD SEEN AND KNOWN HER BEFORE BUT NOT BEING VERY CERTAIN OF IT SHE WAS NOT SLOW TO INQUIRE FROM WHENCE SHE WAS OF WHAT COUNTRY AND WHERE HER LORD WAS BORN SHE INQUIRES WHO THEY BOTH ARE
