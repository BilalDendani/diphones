3717-21498-0000 THE HARDER SHE PULLED THE FIRMER SEEMED THE PLANT AND AT LAST DETERMINED NOT TO BE BEATEN SHE GAVE ONE GREAT TUG AND THE ROSEMARY REMAINED IN HER HANDS THEN SHE HEARD A VOICE CLOSE TO HER SAYING WELL
3717-21498-0001 AND TURNING SHE SAW BEFORE HER A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN WHO ASKED WHY SHE HAD COME TO STEAL HIS FIREWOOD THE GIRL WHO FELT MUCH CONFUSED ONLY MANAGED TO STAMMER OUT AS AN EXCUSE THAT HER FATHER HAD SENT HER
3717-21498-0002 VERY WELL REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN THEN COME WITH ME SO HE TOOK HER THROUGH THE OPENING MADE BY THE TORN UP ROOT AND THEY TRAVELLED TILL THEY REACHED A BEAUTIFUL PALACE SPLENDIDLY FURNISHED BUT ONLY LIGHTED FROM THE TOP
3717-21498-0003 AND WHEN THEY HAD ENTERED HE TOLD HER THAT HE WAS A GREAT LORD AND THAT NEVER HAD HE SEEN A MAIDEN SO BEAUTIFUL AS SHE AND THAT
3717-21498-0004 AND THE MAIDEN SAID YES SHE WOULD AND SO THEY WERE MARRIED THE NEXT DAY THE OLD DAME WHO LOOKED AFTER THE HOUSE HANDED HER ALL THE KEYS BUT POINTED HER OUT ONE THAT SHE WOULD DO WELL NEVER TO USE FOR IF SHE DID
3717-21498-0005 THE WHOLE PALACE WOULD FALL TO THE GROUND AND THE GRASS WOULD GROW OVER IT AND THE DAMSEL HERSELF WOULD BE REMEMBERED NO MORE THE BRIDE PROMISED TO BE CAREFUL BUT IN A LITTLE WHILE WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR HER TO DO
3717-21498-0006 SHE BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT COULD BE IN THE CHEST WHICH WAS OPENED BY THE KEY AS EVERYBODY KNOWS IF WE ONCE BEGIN TO THINK WE SOON BEGIN TO DO AND IT WAS NOT VERY LONG BEFORE THE KEY WAS NO LONGER IN THE MAIDEN'S HAND
3717-21498-0007 BUT THE LOCK WAS STIFF AND RESISTED ALL HER EFFORTS AND IN THE END SHE HAD TO BREAK IT AND WHAT WAS INSIDE AFTER ALL
3717-21498-0008 BREAKING A SPRIG OF ROSEMARY OFF A BUSH HARD BY SHE RESOLVED COST WHAT IT MIGHT TO SEEK HIM THROUGH THE WORLD TILL SHE FOUND HIM SO SHE WALKED AND SHE WALKED AND SHE WALKED TILL SHE ARRIVED AT A HOUSE BUILT OF STRAW AND SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
3717-21498-0009 AND HER MISTRESS ANSWERED HER WHERE HE IS NONE CAN TELL BETTER THAN THE SUN THE MOON AND THE WIND FOR THEY GO EVERYWHERE ON HEARING THESE WORDS THE DAMSEL SET FORTH ONCE MORE
3717-21498-0010 AND WALKED TILL SHE REACHED THE GOLDEN CASTLE WHERE LIVED THE SUN AND SHE KNOCKED BOLDLY AT THE DOOR SAYING ALL HAIL O SUN I HAVE COME TO ASK IF OF YOUR CHARITY YOU WILL HELP ME IN MY NEED
3717-21498-0011 AND I AM WEARY FOR I SEEK MY HUSBAND THROUGH THE WIDE WORLD INDEED SPOKE THE SUN DO YOU RICH AS YOU ARE NEED HELP BUT THOUGH YOU LIVE IN A PALACE WITHOUT WINDOWS THE SUN ENTERS EVERYWHERE
3717-21498-0012 AND HE KNOWS YOU THEN THE BRIDE TOLD HIM THE WHOLE STORY AND DID NOT HIDE HER OWN ILL DOING AND THE SUN LISTENED AND WAS SORRY FOR HER AND THOUGH HE COULD NOT TELL HER WHERE TO GO HE GAVE HER A NUT
3717-21498-0013 ALL HAIL SAID THE GIRL
3717-21498-0014 TO ASK YOUR HELP IT IS MY MISTRESS THE MOON YOU SEEK I WILL TELL HER OF YOUR PRAYER SO THE MOON CAME OUT AND WHEN SHE SAW THE MAIDEN SHE KNEW HER AGAIN
3717-21498-0015 FOR SHE HAD WATCHED HER SLEEPING BOTH IN THE COTTAGE AND IN THE PALACE AND SHE SPAKE TO HER AND SAID DO YOU RICH AS YOU ARE NEED HELP THEN THE GIRL TOLD HER THE WHOLE STORY AND THE MOON LISTENED
3717-21498-0016 TILL SHE CAME TO ANOTHER CASTLE AND SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND SAID ALL HAIL I HAVE COME TO ASK IF OF YOUR CHARITY YOU WILL HELP ME IN MY NEED IT IS MY LORD THE WIND THAT YOU WANT
3717-21498-0017 ANSWERED THE OLD WOMAN WHO OPENED IT I WILL TELL HIM OF YOUR PRAYER AND THE WIND LOOKED ON HER AND KNEW HER AGAIN FOR HE HAD SEEN HER IN THE COTTAGE AND IN THE PALACE AND HE SPAKE TO HER AND SAID
3717-21498-0018 RICH AS YOU ARE WANT HELP AND SHE TOLD HIM THE WHOLE STORY AND THE WIND LISTENED AND WAS SORRY FOR HER AND HE GAVE HER A WALNUT THAT SHE WAS TO EAT IN TIME OF NEED
3717-21498-0019 BUT THE GIRL DID NOT GO AS THE WIND EXPECTED SHE WAS TIRED AND SAD AND KNEW NOT WHERE TO TURN SO SHE BEGAN TO WEEP BITTERLY THE WIND WEPT TOO FOR COMPANY AND SAID DON'T BE FRIGHTENED
3717-21498-0020 I WILL GO AND SEE IF I CAN FIND OUT SOMETHING AND THE WIND DEPARTED WITH A GREAT NOISE AND FUSS AND IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE HE WAS BACK AGAIN BEAMING WITH DELIGHT
3717-21498-0021 FROM WHAT ONE PERSON AND ANOTHER HAVE LET FALL HE EXCLAIMED I HAVE CONTRIVED TO LEARN THAT HE IS IN THE PALACE OF THE KING WHO KEEPS HIM HIDDEN LEST ANYONE SHOULD SEE HIM AND THAT TO MORROW HE IS TO MARRY THE PRINCESS
3717-21498-0022 HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY MAN TO WED HER WHO CAN TELL THE DESPAIR WHICH SEIZED THE POOR MAIDEN WHEN SHE HEARD THIS NEWS
3717-21498-0023 AS SOON AS SHE COULD SPEAK SHE IMPLORED THE WIND TO DO ALL HE COULD TO GET THE WEDDING PUT OFF FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS FOR IT WOULD TAKE HER ALL THAT TIME TO REACH THE PALACE OF THE KING THE WIND GLADLY PROMISED TO DO WHAT HE COULD
3717-21498-0024 CATCHING JUMPING CLIMBING BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE THE LACE WAS TORN THE SATIN STAINED THE PEARLS KNOCKED OFF
3717-21498-0025 IT WAS PLAINLY QUITE IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE WEDDING CLOTHES COULD BE READY NEXT DAY HOWEVER THE KING WAS MUCH TOO ANXIOUS TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER MARRIED TO LISTEN TO ANY EXCUSES AND HE DECLARED THAT A DRESS MUST BE PUT TOGETHER SOMEHOW FOR THE BRIDE TO WEAR
3717-21498-0026 SO THAT THE TAILORS MIGHT TAKE THE DRESS TO PIECES AND MAKE IT FIT BUT BY THIS TIME THE MAIDEN HAD ARRIVED FOOTSORE AND WEARY AT THE CASTLE
3717-21498-0027 AND AS SOON AS SHE REACHED THE DOOR SHE CRACKED HER NUT AND DREW OUT OF IT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MANTLE IN THE WORLD THEN SHE RANG THE BELL AND ASKED IS NOT THE PRINCESS TO BE MARRIED TO DAY YES SHE IS
3717-21498-0028 ASK HER IF SHE WOULD LIKE TO BUY THIS MANTLE AND WHEN THE PRINCESS SAW THE MANTLE SHE WAS DELIGHTED FOR HER WEDDING MANTLE HAD BEEN SPOILT WITH ALL THE OTHER THINGS AND IT WAS TOO LATE TO MAKE ANOTHER SO SHE TOLD THE MAIDEN TO ASK WHAT PRICE SHE WOULD
3717-21498-0029 AND IT SHOULD BE GIVEN HER THE MAIDEN FIXED A LARGE SUM MANY PIECES OF GOLD BUT THE PRINCESS HAD SET HER HEART ON THE MANTLE AND GAVE IT READILY NOW THE MAIDEN HID HER GOLD IN THE POCKET OF HER DRESS
3717-21498-0030 AND TURNED AWAY FROM THE CASTLE THE MOMENT SHE WAS OUT OF SIGHT SHE BROKE HER ALMOND AND DREW FROM IT THE MOST MAGNIFICENT PETTICOATS THAT EVER WERE SEEN THEN SHE WENT BACK TO THE CASTLE AND ASKED IF THE PRINCESS WISHED TO BUY ANY PETTICOATS
3717-21498-0031 NO SOONER DID THE PRINCESS CAST HER EYES ON THE PETTICOATS THAN SHE DECLARED THEY WERE EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE MANTLE AND THAT SHE WOULD GIVE THE MAIDEN WHATEVER PRICE SHE WANTED FOR THEM AND THE MAIDEN NAMED MANY PIECES OF GOLD
3717-21498-0032 WHICH THE PRINCESS PAID HER GLADLY SO PLEASED WAS SHE WITH HER NEW POSSESSIONS THEN THE GIRL WENT DOWN THE STEPS WHERE NONE COULD WATCH HER AND CRACKED HER WALNUT AND OUT CAME THE MOST SPLENDID COURT DRESS THAT ANY DRESSMAKER HAD EVER INVENTED
3717-21498-0033 AND CARRYING IT CAREFULLY IN HER ARMS SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND ASKED IF THE PRINCESS WISHED TO BUY A COURT DRESS WHEN THE MESSAGE WAS DELIVERED THE PRINCESS SPRANG TO HER FEET WITH DELIGHT FOR SHE HAD BEEN THINKING THAT
3717-21498-0034 AFTER ALL IT WAS NOT MUCH USE TO HAVE A LOVELY MANTLE AND ELEGANT PETTICOATS IF SHE HAD NO DRESS AND SHE KNEW THE TAILORS WOULD NEVER BE READY IN TIME SO SHE SENT AT ONCE TO SAY SHE WOULD BUY THE DRESS AND WHAT SUM DID THE MAIDEN WANT FOR IT
3717-21498-0035 AND CONTENTED HERSELF WITH THINKING THAT AFTER ALL IT DID NOT MATTER MUCH SO THE MAIDEN WAS LED TO THE ROOMS WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HER HUSBAND AND WHEN SHE CAME NEAR SHE TOUCHED HIM WITH THE SPRIG OF ROSEMARY THAT SHE CARRIED AND HIS MEMORY CAME BACK AND HE KNEW HER
3717-21498-0036 AND KISSED HER AND DECLARED THAT SHE WAS HIS TRUE WIFE AND THAT HE LOVED HER AND NO OTHER
