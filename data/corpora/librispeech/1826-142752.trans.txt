1826-142752-0000 THE LIMITS OF PHILOSOPHICAL KNOWLEDGE
1826-142752-0001 IN ALL THAT WE HAVE SAID HITHERTO CONCERNING PHILOSOPHY
1826-142752-0002 THIS HOPE I BELIEVE IS VAIN IT WOULD SEEM THAT KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE UNIVERSE AS A WHOLE IS NOT TO BE OBTAINED BY METAPHYSICS AND THAT THE PROPOSED PROOFS THAT IN VIRTUE OF THE LAWS OF LOGIC SUCH AND SUCH THINGS MUST EXIST
1826-142752-0003 AND SUCH AND SUCH OTHERS CANNOT ARE NOT CAPABLE OF SURVIVING A CRITICAL SCRUTINY IN THIS CHAPTER WE SHALL BRIEFLY CONSIDER THE KIND OF WAY IN WHICH SUCH REASONING IS ATTEMPTED WITH A VIEW TO DISCOVERING WHETHER WE CAN HOPE THAT IT MAY BE VALID
1826-142752-0004 WHICH WE WISH TO EXAMINE WAS HEGEL SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE HEGEL'S PHILOSOPHY IS VERY DIFFICULT AND COMMENTATORS DIFFER AS TO THE TRUE INTERPRETATION OF IT
1826-142752-0005 ACCORDING TO THE INTERPRETATION I SHALL ADOPT WHICH IS THAT OF MANY IF NOT MOST OF THE COMMENTATORS AND HAS THE MERIT OF GIVING AN INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT TYPE OF PHILOSOPHY HIS MAIN THESIS IS THAT EVERYTHING SHORT OF THE WHOLE
1826-142752-0006 IS OBVIOUSLY FRAGMENTARY AND OBVIOUSLY INCAPABLE OF EXISTING WITHOUT THE COMPLEMENT SUPPLIED BY THE REST OF THE WORLD JUST AS A COMPARATIVE ANATOMIST FROM A SINGLE BONE SEES WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL THE WHOLE MUST HAVE BEEN
1826-142752-0007 WHICH GRAPPLE IT TO THE NEXT PIECE THE NEXT PIECE IN TURN HAS FRESH HOOKS AND SO ON UNTIL THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IS RECONSTRUCTED THIS ESSENTIAL INCOMPLETENESS APPEARS ACCORDING TO HEGEL EQUALLY IN THE WORLD OF THOUGHT AND IN THE WORLD OF THINGS
1826-142752-0008 WHICH ACCORDING TO HIM HAS NO INCOMPLETENESS NO OPPOSITE AND NO NEED OF FURTHER DEVELOPMENT THE ABSOLUTE IDEA THEREFORE IS ADEQUATE TO DESCRIBE ABSOLUTE REALITY BUT ALL LOWER IDEAS ONLY DESCRIBE REALITY
1826-142752-0009 NOT IN ANY DEGREE EVIL WHOLLY RATIONAL AND WHOLLY SPIRITUAL ANY APPEARANCE TO THE CONTRARY IN THE WORLD WE KNOW CAN BE PROVED LOGICALLY SO HE BELIEVES
1826-142752-0010 TO BE ENTIRELY DUE TO OUR FRAGMENTARY PIECEMEAL VIEW OF THE UNIVERSE IF WE SAW THE UNIVERSE WHOLE AS WE MAY SUPPOSE GOD SEES IT SPACE AND TIME AND MATTER AND EVIL AND ALL STRIVING AND STRUGGLING
1826-142752-0011 IN THIS CONCEPTION THERE IS UNDENIABLY SOMETHING SUBLIME SOMETHING TO WHICH WE COULD WISH TO YIELD ASSENT NEVERTHELESS WHEN THE ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF IT ARE CAREFULLY EXAMINED
1826-142752-0012 THEY APPEAR TO INVOLVE MUCH CONFUSION AND MANY UNWARRANTABLE ASSUMPTIONS THE FUNDAMENTAL TENET UPON WHICH THE SYSTEM IS BUILT UP IS THAT WHAT IS INCOMPLETE MUST BE NOT SELF SUBSISTENT
1826-142752-0013 BE WHAT IT IS IF THOSE OUTSIDE THINGS DID NOT EXIST
1826-142752-0014 THUS BUT FOR THE OBJECTS WHICH HE KNOWS OR LOVES OR HATES HE COULD NOT BE WHAT HE IS HE IS ESSENTIALLY AND OBVIOUSLY A FRAGMENT TAKEN AS THE SUM TOTAL OF REALITY HE WOULD BE SELF CONTRADICTORY
1826-142752-0015 THIS WHOLE POINT OF VIEW HOWEVER TURNS UPON THE NOTION OF THE NATURE OF A THING
1826-142752-0016 IS NOT PART OF THE THING ITSELF ALTHOUGH IT MUST ACCORDING TO THE ABOVE USAGE BE PART OF THE NATURE OF THE THING IF WE MEAN BY A THING'S NATURE ALL THE TRUTHS ABOUT THE THING THEN PLAINLY WE CANNOT KNOW A THING'S NATURE
1826-142752-0017 BUT IF THE WORD NATURE IS USED IN THIS SENSE WE SHALL HAVE TO HOLD THAT THE THING MAY BE KNOWN WHEN ITS NATURE IS NOT KNOWN OR AT ANY RATE IS NOT KNOWN COMPLETELY THERE IS A CONFUSION WHEN THIS USE OF THE WORD NATURE IS EMPLOYED
1826-142752-0018 THUS ACQUAINTANCE WITH A THING DOES NOT INVOLVE KNOWLEDGE OF ITS NATURE IN THE ABOVE SENSE AND ALTHOUGH ACQUAINTANCE WITH A THING IS INVOLVED IN OUR KNOWING ANY ONE PROPOSITION ABOUT A THING KNOWLEDGE OF ITS NATURE IN THE ABOVE SENSE IS NOT INVOLVED
1826-142752-0019 HENCE ONE ACQUAINTANCE WITH A THING DOES NOT LOGICALLY INVOLVE A KNOWLEDGE OF ITS RELATIONS AND TWO A KNOWLEDGE OF SOME OF ITS RELATIONS DOES NOT INVOLVE A KNOWLEDGE OF ALL OF ITS RELATIONS NOR A KNOWLEDGE OF ITS NATURE IN THE ABOVE SENSE
1826-142752-0020 FORMS A SINGLE HARMONIOUS SYSTEM SUCH AS HEGEL BELIEVES THAT IT FORMS AND IF WE CANNOT PROVE THIS WE ALSO CANNOT PROVE THE UNREALITY OF SPACE AND TIME AND MATTER AND EVIL FOR THIS IS DEDUCED BY HEGEL
1826-142752-0021 FROM THE FRAGMENTARY AND RELATIONAL CHARACTER OF THESE THINGS THUS WE ARE LEFT TO THE PIECEMEAL INVESTIGATION OF THE WORLD AND ARE UNABLE TO KNOW THE CHARACTERS OF THOSE PARTS OF THE UNIVERSE THAT ARE REMOTE FROM OUR EXPERIENCE
1826-142752-0022 THIS RESULT DISAPPOINTING AS IT IS TO THOSE WHOSE HOPES HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE SYSTEMS OF PHILOSOPHERS IS IN HARMONY WITH THE INDUCTIVE AND SCIENTIFIC TEMPER OF OUR AGE
1826-142752-0023 AND IS BORNE OUT BY THE WHOLE EXAMINATION OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE WHICH HAS OCCUPIED OUR PREVIOUS CHAPTERS MOST OF THE GREAT AMBITIOUS ATTEMPTS OF METAPHYSICIANS HAVE PROCEEDED BY THE ATTEMPT TO PROVE
1826-142752-0024 THAT SUCH AND SUCH APPARENT FEATURES OF THE ACTUAL WORLD WERE SELF CONTRADICTORY AND THEREFORE COULD NOT BE REAL THE WHOLE TENDENCY OF MODERN THOUGHT HOWEVER IS MORE AND MORE IN THE DIRECTION OF SHOWING THAT THE SUPPOSED CONTRADICTIONS WERE ILLUSORY
1826-142752-0025 A GOOD ILLUSTRATION OF THIS IS AFFORDED BY SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME APPEAR TO BE INFINITE IN EXTENT AND INFINITELY DIVISIBLE IF WE TRAVEL ALONG A STRAIGHT LINE IN EITHER DIRECTION
1826-142752-0026 IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT WE SHALL FINALLY REACH A LAST POINT BEYOND WHICH THERE IS NOTHING NOT EVEN EMPTY SPACE SIMILARLY IF IN IMAGINATION WE TRAVEL BACKWARDS OR FORWARDS IN TIME IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT WE SHALL REACH A FIRST OR LAST TIME
1826-142752-0027 WITH NOT EVEN EMPTY TIME BEYOND IT THUS SPACE AND TIME APPEAR TO BE INFINITE IN EXTENT AGAIN IF WE TAKE ANY TWO POINTS ON A LINE IT SEEMS EVIDENT THAT THERE MUST BE OTHER POINTS BETWEEN THEM HOWEVER SMALL THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM MAY BE
1826-142752-0028 AD INFINITUM IN TIME SIMILARLY HOWEVER LITTLE TIME MAY ELAPSE BETWEEN TWO MOMENTS IT SEEMS EVIDENT THAT THERE WILL BE OTHER MOMENTS BETWEEN THEM THUS SPACE AND TIME APPEAR TO BE INFINITELY DIVISIBLE
1826-142752-0029 BUT AS AGAINST THESE APPARENT FACTS INFINITE EXTENT AND INFINITE DIVISIBILITY PHILOSOPHERS HAVE ADVANCED ARGUMENTS TENDING TO SHOW THAT THERE COULD BE NO INFINITE COLLECTIONS OF THINGS AND THAT THEREFORE THE NUMBER OF POINTS IN SPACE
1826-142752-0030 OR OF INSTANTS IN TIME MUST BE FINITE THUS A CONTRADICTION EMERGED BETWEEN THE APPARENT NATURE OF SPACE AND TIME AND THE SUPPOSED IMPOSSIBILITY OF INFINITE COLLECTIONS
1826-142752-0031 KANT WHO FIRST EMPHASIZED THIS CONTRADICTION DEDUCED THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SPACE AND TIME WHICH HE DECLARED TO BE MERELY SUBJECTIVE AND SINCE HIS TIME VERY MANY PHILOSOPHERS HAVE BELIEVED THAT SPACE AND TIME
1826-142752-0032 ARE MERE APPEARANCE NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF THE WORLD AS IT REALLY IS NOW HOWEVER OWING TO THE LABOURS OF THE MATHEMATICIANS NOTABLY GEORG CANTOR IT HAS APPEARED THAT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF INFINITE COLLECTIONS WAS A MISTAKE
1826-142752-0033 THEY ARE NOT IN FACT SELF CONTRADICTORY BUT ONLY CONTRADICTORY OF CERTAIN RATHER OBSTINATE MENTAL PREJUDICES HENCE THE REASONS FOR REGARDING SPACE AND TIME AS UNREAL HAVE BECOME INOPERATIVE
1826-142752-0034 AND ONE OF THE GREAT SOURCES OF METAPHYSICAL CONSTRUCTIONS IS DRIED UP THE MATHEMATICIANS HOWEVER HAVE NOT BEEN CONTENT WITH SHOWING THAT SPACE AS IT IS COMMONLY SUPPOSED TO BE IS POSSIBLE
1826-142752-0035 THEY HAVE SHOWN ALSO THAT MANY OTHER FORMS OF SPACE ARE EQUALLY POSSIBLE SO FAR AS LOGIC CAN SHOW SOME OF EUCLID'S AXIOMS WHICH APPEAR TO COMMON SENSE TO BE NECESSARY AND WERE FORMERLY SUPPOSED TO BE NECESSARY BY PHILOSOPHERS
1826-142752-0036 ARE NOW KNOWN TO DERIVE THEIR APPEARANCE OF NECESSITY FROM OUR MERE FAMILIARITY WITH ACTUAL SPACE AND NOT FROM ANY A PRIORI LOGICAL FOUNDATION
1826-142752-0037 BY IMAGINING WORLDS IN WHICH THESE AXIOMS ARE FALSE THE MATHEMATICIANS HAVE USED LOGIC TO LOOSEN THE PREJUDICES OF COMMON SENSE AND TO SHOW THE POSSIBILITY OF SPACES DIFFERING SOME MORE SOME LESS
1826-142752-0038 FROM THAT IN WHICH WE LIVE AND SOME OF THESE SPACES DIFFER SO LITTLE FROM EUCLIDEAN SPACE WHERE DISTANCES SUCH AS WE CAN MEASURE ARE CONCERNED
1826-142752-0039 OUR KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT MAY BE IS ENORMOUSLY INCREASED INSTEAD OF BEING SHUT IN WITHIN NARROW WALLS OF WHICH EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY COULD BE EXPLORED WE FIND OURSELVES IN AN OPEN WORLD OF FREE POSSIBILITIES
1826-142752-0040 WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE CASE OF SPACE AND TIME HAS HAPPENED TO SOME EXTENT IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS WELL
1826-142752-0041 AND LEAVING TO EXPERIENCE THE TASK OF DECIDING WHERE DECISION IS POSSIBLE BETWEEN THE MANY WORLDS WHICH LOGIC OFFERS FOR OUR CHOICE THUS KNOWLEDGE AS TO WHAT EXISTS BECOMES LIMITED TO WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM EXPERIENCE
1826-142752-0042 NOT TO WHAT WE CAN ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE FOR AS WE HAVE SEEN THERE IS MUCH KNOWLEDGE BY DESCRIPTION CONCERNING THINGS OF WHICH WE HAVE NO DIRECT EXPERIENCE BUT IN ALL CASES OF KNOWLEDGE BY DESCRIPTION WE NEED SOME CONNEXION OF UNIVERSALS
1826-142752-0043 ENABLING US FROM SUCH AND SUCH A DATUM TO INFER AN OBJECT OF A CERTAIN SORT AS IMPLIED BY OUR DATUM THUS IN REGARD TO PHYSICAL OBJECTS FOR EXAMPLE
1826-142752-0044 IS ITSELF A CONNEXION OF UNIVERSALS AND IT IS ONLY IN VIRTUE OF THIS PRINCIPLE THAT EXPERIENCE ENABLES US TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING PHYSICAL OBJECTS THE SAME APPLIES TO THE LAW OF CAUSALITY
1826-142752-0045 OR TO DESCEND TO WHAT IS LESS GENERAL TO SUCH PRINCIPLES AS THE LAW OF GRAVITATION PRINCIPLES SUCH AS THE LAW OF GRAVITATION ARE PROVED OR RATHER ARE RENDERED HIGHLY PROBABLE
1826-142752-0046 SUCH AS THE PRINCIPLE OF INDUCTION THUS OUR INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS THE SOURCE OF ALL OUR OTHER KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTHS IS OF TWO SORTS
1826-142752-0047 WITH WHICH WE ARE ACQUAINTED AND PURE A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE
1826-142752-0048 IS CRITICISM IT EXAMINES CRITICALLY THE PRINCIPLES EMPLOYED IN SCIENCE AND IN DAILY LIFE IT SEARCHES OUT ANY INCONSISTENCIES THERE MAY BE IN THESE PRINCIPLES AND IT ONLY ACCEPTS THEM WHEN AS THE RESULT OF A CRITICAL INQUIRY
1826-142752-0049 NO REASON FOR REJECTING THEM HAS APPEARED IF AS MANY PHILOSOPHERS HAVE BELIEVED THE PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE SCIENCES WERE CAPABLE WHEN DISENGAGED FROM IRRELEVANT DETAIL
1826-142752-0050 OF GIVING US KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE UNIVERSE AS A WHOLE SUCH KNOWLEDGE WOULD HAVE THE SAME CLAIM ON OUR BELIEF AS SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE HAS
1826-142752-0051 OUR RESULT IS IN THE MAIN POSITIVE
1826-142752-0052 WHEN HOWEVER WE SPEAK OF PHILOSOPHY AS A CRITICISM OF KNOWLEDGE IT IS NECESSARY TO IMPOSE A CERTAIN LIMITATION IF WE ADOPT THE ATTITUDE OF THE COMPLETE SCEPTIC PLACING OURSELVES WHOLLY OUTSIDE ALL KNOWLEDGE
1826-142752-0053 AND ASKING FROM THIS OUTSIDE POSITION TO BE COMPELLED TO RETURN WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF KNOWLEDGE WE ARE DEMANDING WHAT IS IMPOSSIBLE AND OUR SCEPTICISM CAN NEVER BE REFUTED FOR ALL REFUTATION MUST BEGIN WITH SOME PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE
1826-142752-0054 WHICH THE DISPUTANTS SHARE FROM BLANK DOUBT NO ARGUMENT CAN BEGIN HENCE THE CRITICISM OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH PHILOSOPHY EMPLOYS MUST NOT BE OF THIS DESTRUCTIVE KIND IF ANY RESULT IS TO BE ACHIEVED
1826-142752-0055 WITH WHICH MODERN PHILOSOPHY BEGAN IS NOT OF THIS KIND BUT IS RATHER THE KIND OF CRITICISM WHICH WE ARE ASSERTING TO BE THE ESSENCE OF PHILOSOPHY HIS METHODICAL DOUBT CONSISTED IN DOUBTING WHATEVER SEEMED DOUBTFUL
1826-142752-0056 SOME KNOWLEDGE SUCH AS KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXISTENCE OF OUR SENSE DATA APPEARS QUITE INDUBITABLE HOWEVER CALMLY AND THOROUGHLY WE REFLECT UPON IT IN REGARD TO SUCH KNOWLEDGE PHILOSOPHICAL CRITICISM DOES NOT REQUIRE
1826-142752-0057 THAT WE SHOULD ABSTAIN FROM BELIEF BUT THERE ARE BELIEFS SUCH FOR EXAMPLE AS THE BELIEF THAT PHYSICAL OBJECTS EXACTLY RESEMBLE OUR SENSE DATA WHICH ARE ENTERTAINED UNTIL WE BEGIN TO REFLECT BUT ARE FOUND TO MELT AWAY WHEN SUBJECTED TO A CLOSE INQUIRY
1826-142752-0058 SUCH BELIEFS PHILOSOPHY WILL BID US REJECT UNLESS SOME NEW LINE OF ARGUMENT IS FOUND TO SUPPORT THEM BUT TO REJECT THE BELIEFS WHICH DO NOT APPEAR OPEN TO ANY OBJECTIONS HOWEVER CLOSELY WE EXAMINE THEM IS NOT REASONABLE
1826-142752-0059 AND IS NOT WHAT PHILOSOPHY ADVOCATES THE CRITICISM AIMED AT IN A WORD IS NOT THAT WHICH WITHOUT REASON DETERMINES TO REJECT
1826-142752-0060 PHILOSOPHY MAY CLAIM JUSTLY THAT IT DIMINISHES THE RISK OF ERROR AND THAT IN SOME CASES IT RENDERS THE RISK SO SMALL AS TO BE PRACTICALLY NEGLIGIBLE TO DO MORE THAN THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE IN A WORLD WHERE MISTAKES MUST OCCUR
