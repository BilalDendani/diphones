3500-134409-0015 HIS FACE WAS SHRIVELLED AND YELLOW SAVE WHERE THE CHEEKS WERE STREAKED WITH THE COLOUR OF A DRY WINTER APPLE AND WHERE HIS BEARD HAD BEEN THERE LINGERED YET A FEW GREY TUFTS WHICH SEEMED LIKE THE RAGGED EYEBROWS TO DENOTE THE BADNESS OF THE SOIL FROM WHICH THEY SPRUNG
3500-134409-0016 THE WHOLE AIR AND ATTITUDE OF THE FORM WAS ONE OF STEALTHY CAT LIKE OBSEQUIOUSNESS THE WHOLE EXPRESSION OF THE FACE WAS CONCENTRATED IN A WRINKLED LEER COMPOUNDED OF CUNNING LECHEROUSNESS SLYNESS AND AVARICE
3500-134409-0017 SUCH WAS OLD ARTHUR GRIDE IN WHOSE FACE THERE WAS NOT A WRINKLE IN WHOSE DRESS THERE WAS NOT ONE SPARE FOLD OR PLAIT BUT EXPRESSED THE MOST COVETOUS AND GRIPING PENURY AND SUFFICIENTLY INDICATED HIS BELONGING TO THAT CLASS OF WHICH RALPH NICKLEBY WAS A MEMBER
3500-134409-0018 SUCH WAS OLD ARTHUR GRIDE AS HE SAT IN A LOW CHAIR LOOKING UP INTO THE FACE OF RALPH NICKLEBY WHO LOUNGING UPON THE TALL OFFICE STOOL WITH HIS ARMS UPON HIS KNEES LOOKED DOWN INTO HIS A MATCH FOR HIM ON WHATEVER ERRAND HE HAD COME

3500-134409-0033 WHICH DONE HE DRAGGED THE LOW CHAIR A LITTLE NEARER TO RALPH'S HIGH STOOL AND LOOKING UPWARDS INTO HIS IMMOVABLE FACE SAID WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO ME IF I WAS TO TELL YOU THAT I WAS THAT I WAS
3500-134409-0034 GOING TO BE MARRIED I SHOULD TELL YOU REPLIED RALPH LOOKING COLDLY DOWN UPON HIM THAT FOR SOME PURPOSE OF YOUR OWN YOU TOLD A LIE AND THAT IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME AND WOULDN'T BE THE LAST THAT I WASN'T SURPRISED AND WASN'T TO BE TAKEN IN

3500-134409-0038 TO SOME OLD HAG SAID RALPH NO NO CRIED ARTHUR INTERRUPTING HIM AND RUBBING HIS HANDS IN AN ECSTASY
3500-134409-0039 OUT QUITE OUT TO A YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL GIRL FRESH LOVELY BEWITCHING AND NOT NINETEEN DARK EYES LONG EYELASHES
3500-134409-0040 RIPE AND RUDDY LIPS THAT TO LOOK AT IS TO LONG TO KISS BEAUTIFUL CLUSTERING HAIR THAT ONE'S FINGERS ITCH TO PLAY WITH SUCH A WAIST AS MIGHT MAKE A MAN CLASP THE AIR INVOLUNTARILY THINKING OF TWINING HIS ARM ABOUT IT
3500-134409-0041 LITTLE FEET THAT TREAD SO LIGHTLY THEY HARDLY SEEM TO WALK UPON THE GROUND TO MARRY ALL THIS SIR THIS HEY HEY THIS IS SOMETHING MORE THAN COMMON DRIVELLING SAID RALPH AFTER LISTENING WITH A CURLED LIP TO THE OLD SINNER'S RAPTURES
3500-134409-0042 THE GIRL'S NAME OH DEEP DEEP SEE NOW HOW DEEP THAT IS EXCLAIMED OLD ARTHUR HE KNOWS I WANT HIS HELP
3500-134409-0043 HE KNOWS IT MUST ALL TURN TO HIS ADVANTAGE HE SEES THE THING ALREADY HER NAME IS THERE NOBODY WITHIN HEARING
3500-134409-0044 NO HE NEVER HAD A DAUGHTER YOU REMEMBER BRAY REJOINED ARTHUR GRIDE NO
3500-134409-0045 THE DASHING MAN WHO USED HIS HANDSOME WIFE SO ILL IF YOU SEEK TO RECALL ANY PARTICULAR DASHING MAN TO MY RECOLLECTION BY SUCH A TRAIT AS THAT SAID RALPH SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS
3500-134409-0046 BOTH OF US DID BUSINESS WITH HIM WHY HE OWES YOU MONEY
3500-134409-0047 REJOINED RALPH AY AY
3500-134409-0048 OH IT'S HIS DAUGHTER IS IT NATURALLY AS THIS WAS SAID IT WAS NOT SAID SO NATURALLY BUT THAT A KINDRED SPIRIT LIKE OLD ARTHUR GRIDE MIGHT HAVE DISCERNED A DESIGN UPON THE PART OF RALPH
3500-134409-0049 TO LEAD HIM ON TO MUCH MORE EXPLICIT STATEMENTS AND EXPLANATIONS THAN HE WOULD HAVE VOLUNTEERED OR THAT RALPH COULD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD HAVE OBTAINED BY ANY OTHER MEANS OLD ARTHUR HOWEVER WAS SO INTENT UPON HIS OWN DESIGNS
3500-134409-0050 I KNEW YOU COULDN'T FORGET HIM WHEN YOU CAME TO THINK FOR A MOMENT HE SAID YOU WERE RIGHT
3500-134409-0051 BUT OLD ARTHUR GRIDE AND MATRIMONY IS A MOST ANOMALOUS CONJUNCTION OF WORDS OLD ARTHUR GRIDE AND DARK EYES AND EYELASHES AND LIPS THAT TO LOOK AT IS TO LONG TO KISS AND CLUSTERING HAIR THAT HE WANTS TO PLAY WITH AND WAISTS THAT HE WANTS TO SPAN
3500-134409-0052 AND LITTLE FEET THAT DON'T TREAD UPON ANYTHING OLD ARTHUR GRIDE AND SUCH THINGS AS THESE IS MORE MONSTROUS STILL BUT OLD ARTHUR GRIDE MARRYING THE DAUGHTER OF A RUINED DASHING MAN IN THE RULES OF THE BENCH IS THE MOST MONSTROUS AND INCREDIBLE OF ALL
3500-134409-0053 PLAINLY FRIEND ARTHUR GRIDE IF YOU WANT ANY HELP FROM ME IN THIS BUSINESS WHICH OF COURSE YOU DO OR YOU WOULD NOT BE HERE SPEAK OUT AND TO THE PURPOSE AND ABOVE ALL DON'T TALK TO ME OF ITS TURNING TO MY ADVANTAGE FOR I KNOW IT MUST TURN TO YOURS ALSO
3500-134409-0054 AND TO A GOOD ROUND TUNE TOO OR YOU WOULD HAVE NO FINGER IN SUCH A PIE AS THIS THERE WAS ENOUGH ACERBITY AND SARCASM NOT ONLY IN THE MATTER OF RALPH'S SPEECH BUT IN THE TONE OF VOICE IN WHICH HE UTTERED IT AND THE LOOKS WITH WHICH HE EKED IT OUT
3500-134409-0055 TO HAVE FIRED EVEN THE ANCIENT USURER'S COLD BLOOD AND FLUSHED EVEN HIS WITHERED CHEEK BUT HE GAVE VENT TO NO DEMONSTRATION OF ANGER CONTENTING HIMSELF WITH EXCLAIMING AS BEFORE
3500-134409-0056 WHAT A MAN IT IS AND ROLLING HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE AS IF IN UNRESTRAINED ENJOYMENT OF HIS FREEDOM AND DROLLERY CLEARLY OBSERVING HOWEVER FROM THE EXPRESSION IN RALPH'S FEATURES THAT HE HAD BEST COME TO THE POINT AS SPEEDILY AS MIGHT BE
3500-134409-0057 HE COMPOSED HIMSELF FOR MORE SERIOUS BUSINESS AND ENTERED UPON THE PITH AND MARROW OF HIS NEGOTIATION FIRST HE DWELT UPON THE FACT THAT MADELINE BRAY WAS DEVOTED TO THE SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE AND WAS A SLAVE TO EVERY WISH OF HER ONLY PARENT
3500-134409-0058 WHO HAD NO OTHER FRIEND ON EARTH TO WHICH RALPH REJOINED THAT HE HAD HEARD SOMETHING OF THE KIND BEFORE AND THAT IF SHE HAD KNOWN A LITTLE MORE OF THE WORLD SHE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SUCH A FOOL
3500-134409-0059 SECONDLY HE ENLARGED UPON THE CHARACTER OF HER FATHER ARGUING THAT EVEN TAKING IT FOR GRANTED THAT HE LOVED HER IN RETURN WITH THE UTMOST AFFECTION OF WHICH HE WAS CAPABLE YET HE LOVED HIMSELF A GREAT DEAL BETTER
3500-134409-0060 WHICH RALPH SAID IT WAS QUITE UNNECESSARY TO SAY ANYTHING MORE ABOUT AS THAT WAS VERY NATURAL AND PROBABLE ENOUGH AND THIRDLY OLD ARTHUR PREMISED THAT THE GIRL WAS A DELICATE AND BEAUTIFUL CREATURE AND THAT HE HAD REALLY A HANKERING TO HAVE HER FOR HIS WIFE
3500-134409-0061 TO THIS RALPH DEIGNED NO OTHER REJOINDER THAN A HARSH SMILE AND A GLANCE AT THE SHRIVELLED OLD CREATURE BEFORE HIM WHICH WERE HOWEVER SUFFICIENTLY EXPRESSIVE NOW SAID GRIDE
3500-134409-0062 BECAUSE I HAVEN'T OFFERED MYSELF EVEN TO THE FATHER YET I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU BUT THAT YOU HAVE GATHERED ALREADY AH OH DEAR OH DEAR WHAT AN EDGED TOOL YOU ARE DON'T PLAY WITH ME THEN SAID RALPH IMPATIENTLY YOU KNOW THE PROVERB
3500-134409-0063 A REPLY ALWAYS ON THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE CRIED OLD ARTHUR RAISING HIS HANDS AND EYES IN ADMIRATION HE IS ALWAYS PREPARED OH DEAR WHAT A BLESSING TO HAVE SUCH A READY WIT AND SO MUCH READY MONEY TO BACK IT
3500-134409-0064 THEN SUDDENLY CHANGING HIS TONE HE WENT ON I HAVE BEEN BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS TO BRAY'S LODGINGS SEVERAL TIMES WITHIN THE LAST SIX MONTHS IT IS JUST HALF A YEAR SINCE I FIRST SAW THIS DELICATE MORSEL AND OH DEAR WHAT A DELICATE MORSEL IT IS
3500-134409-0065 BUT THAT IS NEITHER HERE NOR THERE I AM HIS DETAINING CREDITOR FOR SEVENTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS YOU TALK AS IF YOU WERE THE ONLY DETAINING CREDITOR SAID RALPH PULLING OUT HIS POCKET BOOK I AM ANOTHER FOR
3500-134409-0066 NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE POUNDS FOUR AND THREEPENCE THE ONLY OTHER MISTER NICKLEBY SAID OLD ARTHUR EAGERLY THE ONLY OTHER NOBODY ELSE WENT TO THE EXPENSE OF LODGING A DETAINER
3500-134409-0067 TRUSTING TO OUR HOLDING HIM FAST ENOUGH I WARRANT YOU WE BOTH FELL INTO THE SAME SNARE OH DEAR WHAT A PITFALL IT WAS IT ALMOST RUINED ME AND LENT HIM OUR MONEY UPON BILLS WITH ONLY ONE NAME BESIDES HIS OWN WHICH TO BE SURE EVERYBODY SUPPOSED TO BE A GOOD ONE
3500-134409-0068 AND WAS AS NEGOTIABLE AS MONEY BUT WHICH TURNED OUT YOU KNOW HOW JUST AS WE SHOULD HAVE COME UPON HIM HE DIED INSOLVENT AH IT WENT VERY NIGH TO RUIN ME THAT LOSS DID GO ON WITH YOUR SCHEME SAID RALPH
3500-134409-0069 RETURNED OLD ARTHUR WITH A CHUCKLE WHETHER THERE'S ANYBODY TO HEAR US OR NOT PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT YOU KNOW NOW IF I OFFER MYSELF TO BRAY AS HIS SON IN LAW UPON ONE SIMPLE CONDITION THAT THE MOMENT I AM FAST MARRIED HE SHALL BE QUIETLY RELEASED
3500-134409-0070 AND HAVE AN ALLOWANCE TO LIVE JUST T'OTHER SIDE THE WATER LIKE A GENTLEMAN HE CAN'T LIVE LONG FOR I HAVE ASKED HIS DOCTOR AND HE DECLARES THAT HIS COMPLAINT IS ONE OF THE HEART AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
3500-134409-0071 DO YOU THINK HE COULD RESIST ME AND IF HE COULD NOT RESIST ME DO YOU THINK HIS DAUGHTER COULD RESIST HIM SHOULDN'T I HAVE HER MISSUS ARTHUR GRIDE
3500-134409-0072 A TIT BIT A DAINTY CHICK SHOULDN'T I HAVE HER MISSUS ARTHUR GRIDE IN A WEEK A MONTH A DAY
3500-134409-0073 GO ON SAID RALPH NODDING HIS HEAD DELIBERATELY AND SPEAKING IN A TONE WHOSE STUDIED COLDNESS PRESENTED A STRANGE CONTRAST TO THE RAPTUROUS SQUEAK TO WHICH HIS FRIEND HAD GRADUALLY MOUNTED GO ON YOU DIDN'T COME HERE TO ASK ME THAT
3500-134409-0074 OH DEAR HOW YOU TALK CRIED OLD ARTHUR EDGING HIMSELF CLOSER STILL TO RALPH OF COURSE I DIDN'T
3500-134409-0075 I CAME TO ASK WHAT YOU WOULD TAKE FROM ME IF I PROSPERED WITH THE FATHER FOR THIS DEBT OF YOURS FIVE SHILLINGS IN THE POUND SIX AND EIGHTPENCE TEN SHILLINGS
3500-134409-0076 BUT YOU WON'T BE SO HARD UPON ME AS THAT I KNOW NOW WILL YOU THERE'S SOMETHING MORE TO BE TOLD SAID RALPH AS STONY AND IMMOVABLE AS EVER YES YES THERE IS BUT YOU WON'T GIVE ME TIME RETURNED ARTHUR GRIDE I WANT A BACKER IN THIS MATTER
3500-134409-0077 ONE WHO CAN TALK AND URGE AND PRESS A POINT WHICH YOU CAN DO AS NO MAN CAN I CAN'T DO THAT FOR I AM A POOR TIMID NERVOUS CREATURE NOW IF YOU GET A GOOD COMPOSITION FOR THIS DEBT WHICH YOU LONG AGO GAVE UP FOR LOST
3500-134409-0078 YOU'LL STAND MY FRIEND AND HELP ME WON'T YOU THERE'S SOMETHING MORE SAID RALPH NO NO INDEED CRIED ARTHUR GRIDE YES YES INDEED I TELL YOU YES SAID RALPH
3500-134409-0079 OH RETURNED OLD ARTHUR FEIGNING TO BE SUDDENLY ENLIGHTENED YOU MEAN SOMETHING MORE AS CONCERNS MYSELF AND MY INTENTION AY SURELY SURELY SHALL I MENTION THAT I THINK YOU HAD BETTER
3500-134409-0080 REJOINED RALPH DRILY I DIDN'T LIKE TO TROUBLE YOU WITH THAT BECAUSE I SUPPOSED YOUR INTEREST WOULD CEASE WITH YOUR OWN CONCERN IN THE AFFAIR SAID ARTHUR GRIDE
3500-134409-0081 WHY SUPPOSING I HAD A KNOWLEDGE OF SOME PROPERTY SOME LITTLE PROPERTY VERY LITTLE TO WHICH THIS PRETTY CHICK WAS ENTITLED WHICH NOBODY DOES OR CAN KNOW OF AT THIS TIME BUT WHICH HER HUSBAND COULD SWEEP INTO HIS POUCH IF HE KNEW AS MUCH AS I DO
3500-134409-0082 WOULD THAT ACCOUNT FOR FOR THE WHOLE PROCEEDING REJOINED RALPH ABRUPTLY NOW LET ME TURN THIS MATTER OVER AND CONSIDER WHAT I OUGHT TO HAVE IF I SHOULD HELP YOU TO SUCCESS
3500-134409-0083 CRIED OLD ARTHUR RAISING HIS HANDS WITH AN IMPLORING GESTURE
3500-134409-0084 IT'S A VERY SMALL PROPERTY IT IS INDEED SAY THE TEN SHILLINGS AND WE'LL CLOSE THE BARGAIN IT'S MORE THAN I OUGHT TO GIVE BUT YOU'RE SO KIND SHALL WE SAY THE TEN DO NOW DO
3500-134409-0085 RALPH TOOK NO NOTICE OF THESE SUPPLICATIONS BUT SAT FOR THREE OR FOUR MINUTES IN A BROWN STUDY LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY AT THE PERSON FROM WHOM THEY PROCEEDED AFTER SUFFICIENT COGITATION HE BROKE SILENCE AND IT CERTAINLY COULD NOT BE OBJECTED THAT HE USED ANY NEEDLESS CIRCUMLOCUTION
3500-134409-0086 OR FAILED TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE PURPOSE IF YOU MARRIED THIS GIRL WITHOUT ME SAID RALPH
3500-134409-0087 WITH THESE REFLECTIONS AND A VERY HARD KNOCK ON THE CROWN OF HIS UNFORTUNATE HAT AT EACH REPETITION OF THE LAST WORD NEWMAN NOGGS WHOSE BRAIN WAS A LITTLE MUDDLED BY SO MUCH OF THE CONTENTS OF THE POCKET PISTOL AS HAD FOUND THEIR WAY THERE DURING HIS RECENT CONCEALMENT
3500-134409-0088 WENT FORTH TO SEEK SUCH CONSOLATION AS MIGHT BE DERIVABLE FROM THE BEEF AND GREENS OF SOME CHEAP EATING HOUSE MEANWHILE THE TWO PLOTTERS HAD BETAKEN THEMSELVES TO THE SAME HOUSE WHITHER NICHOLAS HAD REPAIRED FOR THE FIRST TIME BUT A FEW MORNINGS BEFORE
3500-134409-0089 AND HAVING OBTAINED ACCESS TO MISTER BRAY AND FOUND HIS DAUGHTER FROM HOME HAD BY A TRAIN OF THE MOST MASTERLY APPROACHES THAT RALPH'S UTMOST SKILL COULD FRAME AT LENGTH LAID OPEN THE REAL OBJECT OF THEIR VISIT THERE HE SITS MISTER BRAY SAID RALPH
3500-134409-0090 AS THE INVALID NOT YET RECOVERED FROM HIS SURPRISE RECLINED IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING ALTERNATELY AT HIM AND ARTHUR GRIDE WHAT IF HE HAS HAD THE ILL FORTUNE TO BE ONE CAUSE OF YOUR DETENTION IN THIS PLACE I HAVE BEEN ANOTHER MEN MUST LIVE
3500-134409-0091 YOU ARE TOO MUCH A MAN OF THE WORLD NOT TO SEE THAT IN ITS TRUE LIGHT WE OFFER THE BEST REPARATION IN OUR POWER REPARATION HERE IS AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE THAT MANY A TITLED FATHER WOULD LEAP AT FOR HIS CHILD MISTER ARTHUR GRIDE WITH THE FORTUNE OF A PRINCE
3500-134409-0092 THINK WHAT A HAUL IT IS MY DAUGHTER SIR RETURNED BRAY HAUGHTILY AS I HAVE BROUGHT HER UP WOULD BE A RICH RECOMPENSE FOR THE LARGEST FORTUNE THAT A MAN COULD BESTOW IN EXCHANGE FOR HER HAND
3500-134409-0093 PRECISELY WHAT MADE ME CONSIDER THE THING SO FAIR AND EASY THERE IS NO OBLIGATION ON EITHER SIDE YOU HAVE MONEY AND MISS MADELINE HAS BEAUTY AND WORTH SHE HAS YOUTH YOU HAVE MONEY SHE HAS NOT MONEY YOU HAVE NOT YOUTH
3500-134409-0094 MATCHES ARE MADE IN HEAVEN THEY SAY ADDED ARTHUR GRIDE LEERING HIDEOUSLY AT THE FATHER IN LAW HE WANTED IF WE ARE MARRIED IT WILL BE DESTINY ACCORDING TO THAT
3500-134409-0095 THEN THINK MISTER BRAY SAID RALPH HASTILY SUBSTITUTING FOR THIS ARGUMENT CONSIDERATIONS MORE NEARLY ALLIED TO EARTH THINK WHAT A STAKE IS INVOLVED IN THE ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION OF THESE PROPOSALS OF MY FRIEND HOW CAN I ACCEPT OR REJECT
3500-134409-0096 INTERRUPTED MISTER BRAY WITH AN IRRITABLE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IT REALLY RESTED WITH HIM TO DECIDE IT IS FOR MY DAUGHTER TO ACCEPT OR REJECT IT IS FOR MY DAUGHTER YOU KNOW THAT TRUE SAID RALPH EMPHATICALLY
3500-134409-0097 TO STATE THE REASONS FOR AND AGAINST
3500-134409-0098 RETURNED THE DEBTOR PROUD AND MEAN BY TURNS AND SELFISH AT ALL TIMES I AM HER FATHER AM I NOT WHY SHOULD I HINT AND BEAT ABOUT THE BUSH DO YOU SUPPOSE LIKE HER MOTHER'S FRIENDS AND MY ENEMIES A CURSE UPON THEM ALL
3500-134409-0099 AND THAT SHE SHOULD COMMAND AND I SHOULD OBEY HINT A WISH TOO PERHAPS YOU THINK BECAUSE YOU SEE ME IN THIS PLACE AND SCARCELY ABLE TO LEAVE THIS CHAIR WITHOUT ASSISTANCE THAT I AM SOME BROKEN SPIRITED DEPENDENT CREATURE
3500-134409-0100 WITHOUT THE COURAGE OR POWER TO DO WHAT I MAY THINK BEST FOR MY OWN CHILD STILL THE POWER TO HINT A WISH I HOPE SO PARDON ME RETURNED RALPH WHO THOROUGHLY KNEW HIS MAN AND HAD TAKEN HIS GROUND ACCORDINGLY YOU DO NOT HEAR ME OUT
3500-134409-0101 I WAS ABOUT TO SAY THAT YOUR HINTING A WISH EVEN HINTING A WISH WOULD SURELY BE EQUIVALENT TO COMMANDING WHY OF COURSE IT WOULD RETORTED MISTER BRAY IN AN EXASPERATED TONE
3500-134409-0102 IF YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE HEARD OF THE TIME SIR I TELL YOU THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I CARRIED EVERY POINT IN TRIUMPH AGAINST HER MOTHER'S WHOLE FAMILY
3500-134409-0103 STILL REJOINED RALPH AS MILDLY AS HIS NATURE WOULD ALLOW HIM YOU HAVE NOT HEARD ME OUT YOU ARE A MAN YET QUALIFIED TO SHINE IN SOCIETY WITH MANY YEARS OF LIFE BEFORE YOU THAT IS IF YOU LIVED IN FREER AIR
3500-134409-0104 AND UNDER BRIGHTER SKIES AND CHOSE YOUR OWN COMPANIONS GAIETY IS YOUR ELEMENT YOU HAVE SHONE IN IT BEFORE FASHION AND FREEDOM FOR YOU FRANCE AND AN ANNUITY THAT WOULD SUPPORT YOU THERE IN LUXURY WOULD GIVE YOU A NEW LEASE OF LIFE
3500-134409-0105 THE TOWN RANG WITH YOUR EXPENSIVE PLEASURES ONCE AND YOU COULD BLAZE UP ON A NEW SCENE AGAIN PROFITING BY EXPERIENCE AND LIVING A LITTLE AT OTHERS COST INSTEAD OF LETTING OTHERS LIVE AT YOURS WHAT IS THERE ON THE REVERSE SIDE OF THE PICTURE
3500-134409-0106 WHAT IS THERE I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS THE NEAREST CHURCHYARD BUT A GRAVESTONE THERE WHEREVER IT IS AND A DATE PERHAPS TWO YEARS HENCE PERHAPS TWENTY THAT'S ALL MISTER BRAY RESTED HIS ELBOW ON THE ARM OF HIS CHAIR AND SHADED HIS FACE WITH HIS HAND
3500-134409-0107 I SPEAK PLAINLY SAID RALPH SITTING DOWN BESIDE HIM BECAUSE I FEEL STRONGLY IT'S MY INTEREST THAT YOU SHOULD MARRY YOUR DAUGHTER TO MY FRIEND GRIDE BECAUSE THEN HE SEES ME PAID IN PART THAT IS I DON'T DISGUISE IT I ACKNOWLEDGE IT OPENLY
3500-134409-0108 BUT WHAT INTEREST HAVE YOU IN RECOMMENDING HER TO SUCH A STEP KEEP THAT IN VIEW SHE MIGHT OBJECT REMONSTRATE SHED TEARS TALK OF HIS BEING TOO OLD AND PLEAD THAT HER LIFE WOULD BE RENDERED MISERABLE BUT WHAT IS IT NOW
3500-134409-0109 SEVERAL SLIGHT GESTURES ON THE PART OF THE INVALID SHOWED THAT THESE ARGUMENTS WERE NO MORE LOST UPON HIM THAN THE SMALLEST IOTA OF HIS DEMEANOUR WAS UPON RALPH WHAT IS IT NOW I SAY PURSUED THE WILY USURER OR WHAT HAS IT A CHANCE OF BEING
3500-134409-0110 IF YOU DIED INDEED THE PEOPLE YOU HATE WOULD MAKE HER HAPPY BUT CAN YOU BEAR THE THOUGHT OF THAT NO RETURNED BRAY URGED BY A VINDICTIVE IMPULSE HE COULD NOT REPRESS I SHOULD IMAGINE NOT INDEED SAID RALPH QUIETLY
3500-134409-0111 IF SHE PROFITS BY ANYBODY'S DEATH THIS WAS SAID IN A LOWER TONE LET IT BE BY HER HUSBAND'S DON'T LET HER HAVE TO LOOK BACK TO YOURS AS THE EVENT FROM WHICH TO DATE A HAPPIER LIFE WHERE IS THE OBJECTION LET ME HEAR IT STATED WHAT IS IT
3500-134409-0112 THAT HER SUITOR IS AN OLD MAN WHY HOW OFTEN DO MEN OF FAMILY AND FORTUNE WHO HAVEN'T YOUR EXCUSE BUT HAVE ALL THE MEANS AND SUPERFLUITIES OF LIFE WITHIN THEIR REACH HOW OFTEN DO THEY MARRY THEIR DAUGHTERS TO OLD MEN OR WORSE STILL TO YOUNG MEN WITHOUT HEADS OR HEARTS
3500-134409-0113 TO TICKLE SOME IDLE VANITY STRENGTHEN SOME FAMILY INTEREST OR SECURE SOME SEAT IN PARLIAMENT JUDGE FOR HER SIR JUDGE FOR HER YOU MUST KNOW BEST AND SHE WILL LIVE TO THANK YOU HUSH HUSH
3500-134409-0114 CRIED MISTER BRAY SUDDENLY STARTING UP AND COVERING RALPH'S MOUTH WITH HIS TREMBLING HAND I HEAR HER AT THE DOOR THERE WAS A GLEAM OF CONSCIENCE IN THE SHAME AND TERROR OF THIS HASTY ACTION
3500-134409-0115 WHICH IN ONE SHORT MOMENT TORE THE THIN COVERING OF SOPHISTRY FROM THE CRUEL DESIGN AND LAID IT BARE IN ALL ITS MEANNESS AND HEARTLESS DEFORMITY THE FATHER FELL INTO HIS CHAIR PALE AND TREMBLING
3500-134409-0116 ARTHUR GRIDE PLUCKED AND FUMBLED AT HIS HAT AND DURST NOT RAISE HIS EYES FROM THE FLOOR
