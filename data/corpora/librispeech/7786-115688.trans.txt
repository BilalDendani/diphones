7786-115688-0000 THIS CONVERSATION SET ME THINKING
7786-115688-0001 FOR A GOOD MANY YEARS AND THE HANS WERE JUST FINDING IT OUT FOR CENTURIES THEY HAD NOT REGARDED US AS ANY SORT OF A MENACE
7786-115688-0002 SOMEWHERE IN NU YOK OR BAH FLO OR POSSIBLY IN LO TAN ITSELF THE RECORD OF THIS TRAITOROUS TRANSACTION WOULD BE MORE OR LESS OPENLY FILED IF WE COULD ONLY GET AT IT
7786-115688-0003 I WONDERED IF A RAID MIGHT NOT BE POSSIBLE BILL HEARN AND I TALKED IT OVER WITH OUR HAN AFFAIRS BOSS AND HIS EXPERTS
7786-115688-0004 THERE ENSUED SEVERAL DAYS OF RESEARCH IN WHICH THE HAN RECORDS OF THE ENTIRE DECADE WERE SCANNED AND ANALYZED IN THE END THEY PICKED OUT A MASS OF DETAIL
7786-115688-0005 AND FITTED IT TOGETHER INTO A VERY DEFINITE PICTURE OF THE GREAT CENTRAL FILING OFFICE OF THE HANS IN NU YOK WHERE THE ENTIRE MASS OF OFFICIAL RECORDS WAS KEPT CONSTANTLY AVAILABLE FOR INSTANT PROJECTOSCOPING TO ANY OF THE CITY'S OFFICES
7786-115688-0006 AND OF THE SYSTEM BY WHICH THE INFORMATION WAS FILED THE ATTEMPT BEGAN TO LOOK FEASIBLE THOUGH HART INSTANTLY TURNED THE IDEA DOWN WHEN I FIRST PRESENTED IT TO HIM IT WAS UNTHINKABLE HE SAID SHEER SUICIDE
7786-115688-0007 BUT IN THE END I PERSUADED HIM I WILL NEED I SAID BLASH WHO IS THOROUGHLY FAMILIAR WITH THE HAN LIBRARY SYSTEM BERT GAUNT WHO FOR YEARS HAS SPECIALIZED ON THEIR MILITARY OFFICES BILL BARKER THE RAY SPECIALIST
7786-115688-0008 AND THE BEST SWOOPER PILOT WE HAVE SWOOPERS ARE ONE MAN AND TWO MAN SHIPS DEVELOPED BY THE AMERICANS WITH SKELETON BACKBONES OF INERTRON DURING THE WAR PAINTED GREEN FOR INVISIBILITY AGAINST THE GREEN FORESTS BELOW
7786-115688-0009 AND BELLIES OF CLEAR ULTRON THAT WILL BE MORT GIBBONS SAID HART WE'VE ONLY GOT THREE SWOOPERS LEFT TONY BUT I'LL RISK ONE OF THEM IF YOU AND THE OTHERS WILL VOLUNTARILY RISK YOUR EXISTENCES BUT MIND
7786-115688-0010 I WON'T URGE OR ORDER ONE OF YOU TO GO I'LL SPREAD THE WORD TO EVERY PLANT BOSS AT ONCE TO GIVE YOU ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING YOU NEED IN THE WAY OF EQUIPMENT WHEN I TOLD WILMA OF THE PLAN I EXPECTED HER TO RAISE VIOLENT AND TEARFUL OBJECTIONS
7786-115688-0011 BUT SHE DIDN'T SHE WAS MADE OF FAR STERNER STUFF THAN THE WOMEN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY NOT THAT SHE COULDN'T WEEP AS COPIOUSLY OR BE JUST AS WHIMSICAL ON OCCASION BUT SHE WOULDN'T WEEP FOR THE SAME REASONS SHE JUST GAVE ME AN UNFATHOMABLE LOOK
7786-115688-0012 I CONFESS I WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED THAT SHE COULD SO COURAGEOUSLY RISK MY LOSS EVEN THOUGH I WAS AMAZED AT HER FORTITUDE BUT LATER I WAS TO LEARN HOW LITTLE I KNEW HER THEN WE WERE READY TO SLIDE OFF AT DAWN THE NEXT MORNING
7786-115688-0013 I HAD KISSED WILMA GOOD BYE AT OUR CAMP AND AFTER A FINAL CONFERENCE OVER OUR PLANS WE BOARDED OUR CRAFT AND GENTLY GLIDED AWAY OVER THE TREE TOPS ON A COURSE WHICH AFTER CROSSING THREE ROUTES OF THE HAN SHIPS WOULD TAKE US OUT OVER THE ATLANTIC OFF THE JERSEY COAST
7786-115688-0014 TWICE WE HAD TO NOSE DOWN AND LIE MOTIONLESS ON THE GROUND NEAR A ROUTE WHILE HAN SHIPS PASSED THOSE WERE TENSE MOMENTS HAD THE GREEN BACK OF OUR SHIP BEEN OBSERVED WE WOULD HAVE BEEN DISINTEGRATED IN A SECOND
7786-115688-0015 BUT IT WASN'T ONCE OVER THE WATER HOWEVER WE CLIMBED IN A GREAT SPIRAL TEN MILES IN DIAMETER UNTIL OUR ALTIMETER REGISTERED TEN MILES HERE GIBBONS SHUT OFF HIS ROCKET MOTOR AND WE FLOATED FAR ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE ATLANTIC LINERS
7786-115688-0016 WHOSE COURSE WAS WELL TO THE NORTH OF US ANYHOW AND WAITED FOR NIGHTFALL THEN GIBBONS TURNED FROM HIS CONTROL LONG ENOUGH TO GRIN AT ME I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU TONY
7786-115688-0017 HE SAID THROWING BACK THE LID OF WHAT I HAD SUPPOSED WAS A BIG SUPPLY CASE AND WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF WILMA STEPPED OUT OF THE CASE IF YOU GO INTO ZERO A COMMON EXPRESSION OF THE DAY FOR BEING ANNIHILATED BY THE DISINTEGRATOR RAY
7786-115688-0018 YOU DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO LET YOU GO ALONE DO YOU TONY I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EARS LAST NIGHT WHEN YOU SPOKE OF GOING WITHOUT ME
7786-115688-0019 DON'T YOU KNOW DEAR HEART THAT YOU OFFERED ME THE GREATEST INSULT A HUSBAND COULD GIVE A WIFE YOU DIDN'T OF COURSE THE OTHERS IT SEEMED HAD ALL BEEN IN ON THE SECRET AND NOW THEY WOULD HAVE KIDDED ME UNMERCIFULLY
7786-115688-0020 EXCEPT THAT WILMA'S EYES BLAZED DANGEROUSLY
7786-115688-0021 THIS TOOK SOME TIME AND CALCULATION ON THE PART OF BILL BARKER
7786-115688-0022 THE SLIGHTEST RESORT TO AN ELECTRONIC INSTRUMENT HE FEARED MIGHT BE DETECTED BY OUR ENEMIES LOCATORS IN FACT WE DID NOT DARE BRING OUR SWOOPER ANY LOWER THAN FIVE MILES FOR FEAR THAT ITS CAPACITY MIGHT BE REFLECTED IN THEIR INSTRUMENTS
7786-115688-0023 FINALLY HOWEVER HE SUCCEEDED IN LOCATING ABOVE THE CENTRAL TOWER OF THE CITY IF MY CALCULATIONS ARE AS MUCH AS TEN FEET OFF HE REMARKED WITH CONFIDENCE I'LL EAT THE TOWER NOW THE REST IS UP TO YOU MORT
7786-115688-0024 SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HOLD HER STEADY NO HERE WATCH THIS INDICATOR THE RED BEAM NOT THE GREEN ONE SEE IF YOU KEEP IT EXACTLY CENTERED ON THE NEEDLE YOU'RE O K THE WIDTH OF THE BEAM REPRESENTS SEVENTEEN FEET
7786-115688-0025 FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS WE WATCHED AS GIBBONS BENT OVER HIS LEVERS CONSTANTLY ADJUSTING THEM WITH DEFT TOUCHES OF HIS FINGERS AFTER A BIT OF WAVERING THE BEAM REMAINED CENTERED ON THE NEEDLE NOW I SAID LET'S DROP
7786-115688-0026 I OPENED THE TRAP AND LOOKED DOWN BUT QUICKLY SHUT IT AGAIN WHEN I FELT THE AIR RUSHING OUT OF THE SHIP INTO THE RAREFIED ATMOSPHERE IN A TORRENT GIBBONS LITERALLY YELLED A PROTEST FROM HIS INSTRUMENT BOARD I FORGOT I MUMBLED
7786-115688-0027 SILLY OF ME OF COURSE WE'LL HAVE TO DROP OUT OF COMPARTMENT THE COMPARTMENT TO WHICH I REFERRED WAS SIMILAR TO THOSE IN SOME OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY SUBMARINES
7786-115688-0028 WITH SOME STRUGGLES WE GOT INTO OUR SPECIAL AIR HELMETS AND ADJUSTED THE PRESSURE AT OUR SIGNAL GIBBONS EXHAUSTED THE AIR IN THE COMPARTMENT PUMPING IT INTO THE BODY OF THE SHIP AND AS THE LITTLE SIGNAL LIGHT FLASHED WILMA THREW OPEN THE HATCH
7786-115688-0029 SETTING THE ULTRON WIRE REEL I CLIMBED THROUGH AND BEGAN TO SLIDE DOWN GENTLY WE ALL HAD OUR BELTS ON OF COURSE ADJUSTED TO A WEIGHT BALANCE OF BUT A FEW OUNCES AND THE FIVE MILE REEL OF ULTRON WIRE THAT WAS TO BE OUR GUIDE
7786-115688-0030 WAS OF GOSSAMER FINENESS THOUGH ANYWAY I BELIEVE IT WOULD HAVE LIFTED THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE FIVE OF US SO STRONG AND TOUGH WAS THIS INVISIBLE METAL AS AN EXTRA PRECAUTION SINCE THE WIRE WAS OF THE PUREST METAL AND THEREFORE TOTALLY INVISIBLE EVEN IN DAYLIGHT
7786-115688-0031 WE ALL HAD OUR BELTS HOOKED ON SMALL RINGS THAT SLID DOWN THE WIRE I WENT DOWN WITH THE END OF THE WIRE WILMA FOLLOWED A FEW FEET ABOVE ME THEN BARKER GAUNT AND BLASH GIBBONS OF COURSE STAYED BEHIND TO HOLD THE SHIP IN POSITION
7786-115688-0032 AND CONTROL THE PAYING OUT OF THE LINE WE ALL HAD OUR ULTROPHONES IN PLACE INSIDE OUR AIR HELMETS AND SO COULD CONVERSE WITH ONE ANOTHER AND WITH GIBBONS BUT AT WILMA'S SUGGESTION
7786-115688-0033 WE KEPT THEM ADJUSTED TO SHORT RANGE WORK FOR FEAR THAT THOSE WHO HAD BEEN CLEARING WITH THE HANS AND AGAINST WHOM WE WERE ON A RAID FOR EVIDENCE MIGHT ALSO PICK UP OUR CONVERSATION WE HAD NO FEAR THAT THE HANS WOULD HEAR US
7786-115688-0034 IN FACT WE HAD THE ADDED ADVANTAGE THAT EVEN AFTER WE LANDED WE COULD CONVERSE FREELY WITHOUT DANGER OF THEIR HEARING OUR VOICES THROUGH OUR AIR HELMETS FOR A WHILE I COULD SEE NOTHING BELOW BUT UTTER DARKNESS THEN I REALIZED FROM THE FEEL OF THE AIR
7786-115688-0035 AS MUCH AS FROM ANYTHING THAT WE WERE SINKING THROUGH A CLOUD LAYER WE PASSED THROUGH TWO MORE CLOUD LAYERS BEFORE ANYTHING WAS VISIBLE TO US THEN THERE CAME UNDER MY GAZE ABOUT TWO MILES BELOW ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SIGHTS I HAVE EVER SEEN
7786-115688-0036 THE SOFT YET BRILLIANT RADIANCE OF THE GREAT HAN CITY OF NU YOK
7786-115688-0037 TOWER PILED UP ON TOWER AND ALL BUILT ON THE VAST BASE MASS OF THE CITY
7786-115688-0038 THE CITY I NOTICED WITH SOME SURPRISE DID NOT COVER ANYTHING LIKE THE SAME AREA AS THE NEW YORK OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY IT OCCUPIED AS A MATTER OF FACT ONLY THE LOWER HALF OF MANHATTAN ISLAND
7786-115688-0039 TO PROVIDE BERTHS FOR THE GREAT LINERS AND OTHER AIR CRAFT STRAIGHT BENEATH MY FEET WAS A TINY DARK PATCH IT SEEMED THE ONLY SPOT IN THE ENTIRE CITY THAT WAS NOT AFLAME WITH RADIANCE THIS WAS THE CENTRAL TOWER
7786-115688-0040 IN THE TOP FLOORS OF WHICH WERE HOUSED THE VAST LIBRARY OF RECORD FILES AND THE MAIN PROJECTOSCOPE PLANT YOU CAN SHOOT THE WIRE NOW I ULTROPHONED GIBBONS AND LET GO THE LITTLE WEIGHTED KNOB IT DROPPED LIKE A PLUMMET
7786-115688-0041 ON WHICH A FAINT LIGHT GLOWED AS A SIGNAL FOR OURSELVES MIGHT BE OBSERVED BY ANY HAN GUARD OR NIGHT PROWLER APPARENTLY IT WAS NOT
7786-115688-0042 AND FORTUNATELY FOR OUR PLAN IN DARKNESS
7786-115688-0043 OR FROM WHICH THERE WAS ANY NEED TO OBSERVE IT THE HANS HAD NEGLECTED TO LIGHT THE TOWER ROOF OR INDEED TO OCCUPY IT AT ALL THIS WAS THE REASON WE HAD SELECTED IT AS OUR LANDING PLACE AS SOON AS GIBBONS HAD OUR WORD HE EXTINGUISHED THE KNOB LIGHT
7786-115688-0044 AND THE KNOB AS WELL AS THE WIRE BECAME TOTALLY INVISIBLE AT OUR ULTROPHONED WORD HE WOULD LIGHT IT AGAIN NO GUN PLAY NOW I WARNED SWORDS ONLY AND THEN ONLY IF ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
7786-115688-0045 CLOSELY BUNCHED AND TREADING AS LIGHTLY AS ONLY INERTRON BELTED PEOPLE COULD
7786-115688-0046 WHERE GAUNT AND BLASH ASSURED US THE MILITARY OFFICES WERE LOCATED TWICE BARKER CAUTIONED US TO STOP AS WE WERE ABOUT TO PASS IN FRONT OF MIRROR LIKE WINDOWS IN THE PASSAGE WALL AND FLATTENING OURSELVES TO THE FLOOR WE CRAWLED PAST THEM
7786-115688-0047 PROJECTOSCOPES HE SAID PROBABLY ON AUTOMATIC RECORD ONLY AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT STILL WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ANY RECORDS FOR THEM TO STUDY AFTER WE'RE GONE
7786-115688-0048 WERE YOU EVER HERE BEFORE I ASKED NO HE REPLIED BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN STUDYING THEIR ELECTROPHONE COMMUNICATIONS FOR SEVEN YEARS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THESE MACHINES WHEN I RUN ACROSS
