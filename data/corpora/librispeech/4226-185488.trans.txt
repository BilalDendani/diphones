4226-185488-0000 THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS DISEASED RELATIVES A HUNGRY SPIRIT PALMING A BALLOT REVELATIONS ON STRIPS OF PAPER AN APTITUDE FOR DECEPTION IS ALL THE CAPITAL THAT A PERSON REQUIRES
4226-185488-0001 IN ORDER TO BECOME A SPIRIT MEDIUM OR AT LEAST TO GAIN THE REPUTATION OF BEING ONE BACKING UP THE PRETENCE TO MEDIUMSHIP WITH A SHOW OF SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS IS ALL SUFFICIENT TO ENLIST ATTENTION AND INSURE THE MAKING OF CONVERTS
4226-185488-0002 ONE OF THE MOST NOTED OF THE MEDIUMISTIC FRATERNITY WHOSE NAME I DO NOT CHOOSE TO GIVE AT PRESENT STEADILY PURSUED HIS BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN A ROOM IN BROADWAY IN THIS CITY AND SUCCEEDED NOT ONLY IN HUMBUGGING A GOOD MANY PEOPLE
4226-185488-0003 BUT IN WHAT WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO HIM ACQUIRING QUITE AN AMOUNT OF MONEY HIS MODE OF OPERATING WAS THE BALLOT TEST AND WAS AS FOLLOWS MEDIUM AND INVESTIGATOR BEING SEATED OPPOSITE EACH OTHER AT A TABLE
4226-185488-0004 THE LATTER WAS HANDED SEVERAL SLIPS OF BLANK PAPER
4226-185488-0005 OF SEVERAL OF HIS DECEASED RELATIVES WHICH BEING DONE HE WAS DESIRED TO TOUCH THE FOLDED PAPERS ONE AFTER THE OTHER TILL ONE SHOULD BE DESIGNATED BY THREE TIPS OF THE TABLE AS CONTAINING THE NAME OF THE SPIRIT WHO WOULD COMMUNICATE
4226-185488-0006 THE SELECTED PAPER WAS LAID ASIDE AND THE OTHERS THROWN UPON THE FLOOR THE INVESTIGATOR BEING FURTHER REQUESTED TO WRITE ON AS MANY DIFFERENT PIECES OF PAPER AS CONTAINED THE NAMES AND THE RELATION TO HIMSELF OF THE SPIRITS BEARING THEM
4226-185488-0007 SUPPOSING THE NAMES WRITTEN WERE MARY JOSEPH AND SAMUEL BEING RESPECTIVELY THE INVESTIGATOR'S MOTHER FATHER AND BROTHER THE LAST NAMED CLASS WOULD BE SECONDLY WRITTEN
4226-185488-0008 AND ONE OF THEM DESIGNATED BY THREE TIPS OF THE TABLE AS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE RESPECTIVE AGES OF THE DECEASED PARTIES AT THE TIME OF THEIR DECEASE WOULD ALSO BE WRITTEN AND ONE OF THEM SELECTED THE FIRST TEST CONSISTED IN HAVING THE SELECTED NAME
4226-185488-0009 RELATIONSHIP AND AGE CORRESPOND THAT IS REFER TO THE SAME PARTY TO ASCERTAIN WHICH THE INVESTIGATOR WAS DESIRED TO LOOK AT THEM AND STATE IF IT WAS THE CASE IF THE CORRESPONDENCE WAS AFFIRMED A COMMUNICATION WAS SOON GIVEN
4226-185488-0010 WITH THE SELECTED NAME RELATIONSHIP AND AGE APPENDED QUESTIONS WRITTEN IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MEDIUM WERE ANSWERED RELEVANTLY IF NOT PERTINENTLY INVESTIGATORS GENERALLY DID THEIR PART OF THE WRITING IN A GUARDED MANNER
4226-185488-0011 INTERPOSING THEIR LEFT HAND BETWEEN THE PAPER ON WHICH THEY WROTE AND THE MEDIUM'S EYES AND THEY WERE VERY MUCH ASTONISHED WHEN THEY RECEIVED A COMMUNICATION COUCHED IN AFFECTIONATE TERMS WITH THE NAMES OF THEIR SPIRIT FRIENDS ATTACHED
4226-185488-0012 BY LONG PRACTICE THE MEDIUM WAS ENABLED TO DETERMINE WHAT THE INVESTIGATOR WROTE BY THE MOTION OF HIS HAND IN WRITING NINE OUT OF TEN WROTE THE RELATIONSHIP FIRST THAT CORRESPONDED WITH THE FIRST NAME THEY HAD WRITTEN
4226-185488-0013 THEREFORE IF THE MEDIUM SELECTED THE FIRST THAT WAS WRITTEN OF EACH CLASS THEY IN MOST CASES REFERRED TO THE SAME SPIRIT HE WAITED TILL THE INVESTIGATOR HAD AFFIRMED THE COINCIDENCE BEFORE PROCEEDING
4226-185488-0014 WHEN IT OUGHT TO BE YOUR FATHER JOHN THE REASON HE DID NOT DESIRE INQUIRERS TO WRITE THE SURNAMES OF THEIR SPIRIT FRIENDS WAS THIS ALMOST ALL CHRISTIAN NAMES ARE COMMON AND HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE MOTIONS WHICH THE HAND MUST MAKE IN WRITING THEM
4226-185488-0015 BUT THERE ARE COMPARATIVELY FEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE SAME SURNAMES AND TO DETERMINE THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DIFFICULT NO FACT WAS COMMUNICATED THAT HAD NOT BEEN SURREPTITIOUSLY GLEANED FROM THE INVESTIGATOR
4226-185488-0016 AN OLD GENTLEMAN APPARENTLY FROM THE COUNTRY ONE DAY ENTERED THE ROOM OF THIS MEDIUM AND EXPRESSED A DESIRE FOR A SPERIT COMMUNICATION HE WAS TOLD TO TAKE A SEAT AT THE TABLE AND TO WRITE THE NAMES OF HIS DECEASED RELATIVES
4226-185488-0017 THE MEDIUM LIKE MANY OTHERS INCORRECTLY PRONOUNCED THE TERM DECEASED
4226-185488-0018 THE OLD GENTLEMAN CAREFULLY ADJUSTED HIS SPECS AND DID WHAT WAS REQUIRED OF HIM A NAME AND RELATIONSHIP HAVING BEEN SELECTED FROM THOSE WRITTEN THE INVESTIGATOR WAS DESIRED TO EXAMINE AND STATE IF THEY REFERRED TO ONE PARTY
4226-185488-0019 WAL I DECLARE THEY DO SAID HE BUT I SAY MISTER WHAT HAS THEM PAPERS TO DO WITH A SPERIT COMMUNICATION YOU WILL SEE DIRECTLY REPLIED THE MEDIUM WHEREUPON THE LATTER SPASMODICALLY WROTE A COMMUNICATION
4226-185488-0020 WHICH READ SOMEWHAT AS FOLLOWS MY DEAR HUSBAND I AM VERY GLAD TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS YOU THROUGH THIS CHANNEL KEEP ON INVESTIGATING AND YOU WILL SOON BE CONVINCED OF THE GREAT FACT OF SPIRIT INTERCOURSE I AM HAPPY IN MY SPIRIT HOME
4226-185488-0021 PATIENTLY AWAITING THE TIME WHEN YOU WILL JOIN ME HERE ET CETERA YOUR LOVING WIFE BETSEY
4226-185488-0022 DISEASED RETURNED THE OLD MAN WAL SHE AIN'T ANYTHING ELSE FOR SHE'S HAD THE RUMATIZ ORFULLY FOR SIX MONTHS SAYING WHICH HE TOOK HIS HAT AND LEFT CONCLUDING THAT IT WAS NOT WORTH WHILE TO KEEP ON INVESTIGATING ANY LONGER AT THAT TIME
4226-185488-0023 THIS SAME MEDIUM NOT LONG SINCE VISITED GREAT BRITAIN FOR THE PURPOSE OF PRACTICING HIS PROFESSION THERE IN ONE OF THE CITIES OF SCOTLAND SOME SHREWD INVESTIGATOR DIVINED THAT HE WAS ABLE TO NEARLY GUESS FROM THE MOTION OF THE HAND WHAT QUESTIONS WERE WRITTEN
4226-185488-0024 ARE YOU HAPPY BEING A QUESTION COMMONLY ASKED THE SPIRITS ONE OF THESE GENTLEMEN VARIED IT BY ASKING ARE YOU HUNGRY THE REPLY WAS AN EMPHATIC AFFIRMATIVE THEY TRICKED THE TRICKSTER IN OTHER WAYS ONE OF WHICH WAS TO WRITE THE NAMES OF MORTALS INSTEAD OF SPIRITS
4226-185488-0025 IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE HOWEVER AS TO GETTING A COMMUNICATION TO TIP THE TABLE WITHOUT APPARENT MUSCULAR EXERTION THIS IMPOSTOR PLACED HIS HANDS ON IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE PISIFORM BONE WHICH MAY BE FELT PROJECTING AT THE LOWER CORNER OF THE PALM OPPOSITE THE THUMB
4226-185488-0026 PRESSED AGAINST THE EDGE BY PUSHING THE TABLE TIPPED FROM HIM IT BEING PREVENTED FROM SLIDING BY LITTLE SPIKES IN THE LEGS OF THE SIDE OPPOSITE THE OPERATOR THERE ARE OTHER BALLOT TEST MEDIUMS AS THEY ARE CALLED WHO HAVE A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT METHOD OF CHEATING
4226-185488-0027 THEY TOO REQUIRE INVESTIGATORS TO WRITE THE NAMES IN FULL HOWEVER OF THEIR SPIRIT FRIENDS THE SLIPS OF PAPER CONTAINING THE NAMES TO BE FOLDED AND PLACED ON A TABLE THE MEDIUM THEN SEIZES ONE OF THE BALLOTS AND ASKS
4226-185488-0028 DROPPING THAT AND TAKING ANOTHER ON THIS SO HE HANDLES ALL THE PAPERS WITHOUT GETTING A RESPONSE DURING THIS TIME HOWEVER HE HAS DEXTEROUSLY PALMED ONE OF THE BALLOTS WHICH WHILE TELLING THE INVESTIGATOR TO BE PATIENT
4226-185488-0029 AS THE SPIRITS WOULD DOUBTLESS SOON COME HE OPENS WITH HIS LEFT HAND ON HIS KNEE UNDER THE EDGE OF THE TABLE A MERE GLANCE ENABLES HIM TO READ THE NAME REFOLDING THE PAPER AND RETAINING IT IN HIS HAND HE REMARKS I WILL TOUCH THE BALLOTS AGAIN
4226-185488-0030 AND PERHAPS ONE OF THEM WILL BE DESIGNATED THIS TIME DROPPING AMONG THE REST THE ONE HE HAD PALMED HE SOON PICKS IT UP AGAIN WHEREAT THREE LOUD RAPS ARE HEARD THAT PAPER SAYS HE TO THE INVESTIGATOR
4226-185488-0031 PROBABLY CONTAINS THE NAME OF THE SPIRIT WHO RAPPED PLEASE HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND THEN SEIZING A PENCIL HE WRITES A NAME WHICH THE INVESTIGATOR FINDS TO BE THE ONE CONTAINED IN THE SELECTED PAPER IF THE BALLOTS ARE FEW IN NUMBER A BLANK IS PUT WITH THE PILE
4226-185488-0032 WHEN THE MEDIUM PALMS ONE ELSE THE LATTER MIGHT BE MISSED IT SEEMS THE SPIRITS CAN NEVER GIVE THEIR NAMES WITHOUT BEING REMINDED OF THEM BY THE INVESTIGATOR AND THEN THEY ARE SO DOUBTFUL OF THEIR OWN IDENTITY THAT THEY HAVE BUT LITTLE TO SAY FOR THEMSELVES
4226-185488-0033 ONE MEDIUM TO WHOM I HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED AFTER A SOJOURN OF SEVERAL YEARS IN CALIFORNIA WHITHER HE WENT FROM BOSTON SEEKING WHOM HE MIGHT HUMBUG HAS NOW RETURNED TO THE EAST AND IS OPERATING IN THIS CITY BESIDES ANSWERING SEALED LETTERS
4226-185488-0034 HE FURNISHES WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS TO PARTIES VISITING HIM AT HIS ROOMS A SITTING HOWEVER BEING GRANTED TO BUT ONE PERSON AT A TIME HIS TERMS ARE ONLY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR SEATED AT A TABLE IN A PART OF THE ROOM WHERE IS THE MOST LIGHT
4226-185488-0035 HE HANDS THE INVESTIGATOR A STRIP OF BLANK WHITE PAPER RATHER THIN AND LIGHT OF TEXTURE ABOUT A YARD LONG AND SIX INCHES WIDE REQUESTING HIM TO WRITE ACROSS ONE END OF IT A SINGLE QUESTION ADDRESSED TO A SPIRIT FRIEND THEN TO SIGN HIS OWN NAME
4226-185488-0036 AND FOLD THE PAPER ONCE OR TWICE OVER WHAT HE HAS WRITTEN FOR INSTANCE BROTHER SAMUEL WILL YOU COMMUNICATE WITH ME THROUGH THIS MEDIUM WILLIAM FRANKLIN TO LEARN WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN THE MEDIUM LAYS THE PAPER DOWN ON THE TABLE
4226-185488-0037 MADE BY THE INQUIRER IF THAT DOES NOT RENDER THE WRITING VISIBLE THROUGH THE ONE THICKNESS OF PAPER THAT COVERS IT HE SLIGHTLY RAISES THE EDGE OF THE FOLDS WITH HIS LEFT HAND WHILE HE CONTINUES TO RUB WITH HIS RIGHT AND THAT ADMITS OF THE LIGHT SHINING THROUGH SO THAT THE WRITING CAN BE READ
4226-185488-0038 THE OTHER PARTY IS SO SITUATED THAT THE WRITING IS NOT VISIBLE TO HIM THROUGH THE PAPER AND HE IS NOT LIKELY TO PRESUME THAT IT IS VISIBLE TO THE MEDIUM THE LATTER HAVING ASSIGNED AS A REASON FOR HIS MANIPULATIONS THAT SPIRITS WERE ABLE TO READ THE QUESTIONS
4226-185488-0039 ONLY BY MEANS OF THE ODYLIC MAGNETIC OR SOME OTHER EMANATION FROM THE ENDS OF HIS FINGERS HAVING LEARNED THE QUESTION OF COURSE THE MEDIUM CAN REPLY TO IT GIVING THE NAME OF THE SPIRIT ADDRESSED BUT BEFORE DOING SO
4226-185488-0040 HE DOUBLES THE TWO FOLDS MADE BY THE INQUIRER AND FOR A SHOW OF CONSISTENCY AGAIN RUBS HIS FINGERS OVER THE PAPER THEN MORE FOLDS AND MORE RUBBING ALL THE FOLDING ADDITIONAL TO THE INQUIRER'S BEING DONE TO KEEP THE LATTER FROM OBSERVING WHEN HE COMES TO READ THE ANSWER
4226-185488-0041 THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THE MEDIUM TO READ THE QUESTION THROUGH THE TWO FOLDS OF PAPER THE ANSWER IS WRITTEN UPON THE SAME STRIP OF PAPER THAT ACCOMPANIES THE QUESTION THE MEDIUM REQUIRES THE INVESTIGATOR TO WRITE HIS QUESTIONS EACH ON A DIFFERENT STRIP OF PAPER AND BEFORE ANSWERING
4226-185488-0042 HE EVERY TIME MANIPULATES THE PAPER IN THE WAY I HAVE DESCRIBED WHEN RUBBING HIS FINGERS OVER THE QUESTION HE OFTEN SHUTS THE EYE WHICH IS TOWARD THE INQUIRER WHICH PREVENTS SUSPICION BUT THE OTHER EYE IS OPEN WIDE ENOUGH TO ENABLE HIM TO READ THE QUESTION THROUGH THE PAPER
