7502-100425-0000 THIS ARTICLE CONSISTED OF CONTRIBUTIONS FROM EXPERTS IN THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF INDUSTRY INCLUDING ONE FROM A METEOROLOGICAL EXPERT WHO I NEED HARDLY TELL YOU FORECASTED A WET SUMMER AND ENDED WITH A GENERAL SUMMING UP OF THE YEAR BY OLD MOORE OR ONE OF THE MINOR PROPHETS
7502-100425-0001 OLD MOORE I AM SORRY TO SAY LEFT ME COLD I SHOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE IN ASTROLOGY BUT I CANNOT I SHOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT THE HEAVENLY BODIES SORT THEMSELVES INTO CERTAIN POSITIONS IN ORDER THAT ZADKIEL MAY BE KEPT IN TOUCH WITH THE FUTURE
7502-100425-0002 THE IDEA OF A STAR WHIZZING A MILLION MILES OUT OF ITS PATH BY WAY OF INDICATING A SENSATIONAL DIVORCE CASE IN HIGH LIFE IS EXTRAORDINARILY MASSIVE BUT CANDIDLY I DO NOT BELIEVE THE STARS BOTHER WHAT THE STARS ARE FOR
7502-100425-0003 WHAT THEY ARE LIKE WHEN YOU GET THERE I DO NOT KNOW BUT A STARRY NIGHT WOULD NOT BE SO BEAUTIFUL IF IT WERE SIMPLY MEANT AS A WARNING TO SOME UNPLEASANT FINANCIER THAT KAFFIRS WERE GOING UP THE ORDINARY MAN LOOKS AT THE HEAVENS AND THINKS WHAT AN INSIGNIFICANT ATOM HE IS BENEATH THEM
7502-100425-0004 THE BELIEVER IN ASTROLOGY LOOKS UP AND REALIZES AFRESH HIS OVERWHELMING IMPORTANCE PERHAPS AFTER ALL I AM GLAD I DO NOT BELIEVE LIFE MUST BE A VERY TRICKY THING FOR THE SUPERSTITIOUS
7502-100425-0005 AT DINNER A NIGHT OR TWO AGO I HAPPENED TO SAY THAT I HAD NEVER BEEN IN DANGER OF DROWNING I AM NOT SURE NOW THAT IT WAS TRUE BUT I STILL THINK THAT IT WAS HARMLESS HOWEVER BEFORE I HAD TIME TO ELABORATE MY THEME WHATEVER IT WAS I WAS PEREMPTORILY ORDERED TO TOUCH WOOD
7502-100425-0006 I PROTESTED THAT BOTH MY FEET WERE ON THE POLISHED OAK AND BOTH MY ELBOWS ON THE POLISHED MAHOGANY ONE ALWAYS KNEW THAT SOME GOOD INSTINCT INSPIRED THE PLEASANT HABIT OF ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND THAT ANYHOW I DID NOT SEE THE NEED HOWEVER BECAUSE ONE MUST NOT ARGUE AT DINNER
7502-100425-0007 I TAPPED THE TABLE TWO OR THREE TIMES AND NOW I SUPPOSE I AM IMMUNE AT THE SAME TIME I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHOM I HAVE APPEASED FOR THIS MUST BE THE IDEA OF THE WOOD TOUCHING SUPERSTITION THAT A MALIGNANT SPIRIT DOGS ONE'S CONVERSATIONAL FOOTSTEPS
7502-100425-0008 LISTENING EAGERLY FOR THE COMPLACENT WORD I HAVE NEVER HAD THE MUMPS YOU SAY AIRILY HA HA SAYS THE SPIRIT HAVEN'T YOU JUST YOU WAIT TILL NEXT TUESDAY MY BOY UNCONSCIOUSLY WE ARE CREDITING FATE WITH OUR OWN HUMAN WEAKNESSES
7502-100425-0009 IF A MAN STANDING ON THE EDGE OF A POND SAID ALOUD I HAVE NEVER FALLEN INTO A POND IN MY LIFE AND WE HAPPENED TO BE JUST BEHIND HIM THE TEMPTATION TO PUSH HIM IN WOULD BE IRRESISTIBLE IRRESISTIBLE THAT IS BY US
7502-100425-0010 BUT IT IS CHARITABLE TO ASSUME THAT PROVIDENCE CAN CONTROL ITSELF BY NOW
7502-100425-0011 THAT THEY LIKE IT STROKED NOBODY I SUPPOSE NOT EVEN THE MOST SUPERSTITIOUS REALLY THINKS THAT FATE IS ESPECIALLY TOUCHY IN THE MATTER OF SALT AND LADDERS EQUALLY OF COURSE MANY PEOPLE WHO THROW SPILT SALT OVER THEIR LEFT SHOULDERS ARE NOT SUPERSTITIOUS IN THE LEAST
7502-100425-0012 AND ARE ONLY CONCERNED TO DISPLAY THAT READINESS IN THE FACE OF ANY SOCIAL EMERGENCY WHICH IS SAID TO BE THE MARK OF GOOD MANNERS
7502-100425-0013 TO BEND BEFORE THE FORCES WHICH WORK FOR HARM AND THEY PAY TRIBUTE TO FATE BY MEANS OF THESE LITTLE CUSTOMS IN THE HOPE THAT THEY WILL SECURE IN RETURN AN IMMUNITY FROM EVIL THE TRIBUTE IS NOMINAL BUT IT IS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT ALL THE SAME
7502-100425-0014 A PROPER SENSE OF PROPORTION LEAVES NO ROOM FOR SUPERSTITION A MAN SAYS I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A SHIPWRECK AND BECOMING NERVOUS TOUCHES WOOD WHY IS HE NERVOUS HE HAS THIS PARAGRAPH BEFORE HIS EYES
7502-100425-0015 A REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE THIS GENTLEMAN HAD BEEN SAYING ONLY A FEW DAYS BEFORE THAT HE HAD NEVER BEEN IN A SHIPWRECK LITTLE DID HE THINK THAT HIS NEXT VOYAGE WOULD FALSIFY HIS WORDS SO TRAGICALLY
7502-100425-0016 PERHAPS HE HAS CERTAINLY HE HAS NEVER READ A PARAGRAPH LIKE THIS AMONG THE DECEASED WAS MISTER BY A
7502-100425-0017 YET THAT PARAGRAPH COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN TRUTHFULLY THOUSANDS OF TIMES A SENSE OF PROPORTION WOULD TELL YOU THAT IF ONLY ONE SIDE OF A CASE IS EVER RECORDED THAT SIDE ACQUIRES AN UNDUE IMPORTANCE THE TRUTH IS THAT FATE DOES NOT GO OUT OF ITS WAY TO BE DRAMATIC
7502-100425-0018 IF YOU OR I HAD THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH IN OUR HANDS WE SHOULD NO DOUBT ARRANGE SOME REMARKABLY BRIGHT AND TELLING EFFECTS A MAN WHO SPILT THE SALT CALLOUSLY WOULD BE DROWNED NEXT WEEK IN THE DEAD SEA AND A COUPLE WHO MARRIED IN MAY WOULD EXPIRE SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THE MAY FOLLOWING
7502-100425-0019 IT GOES ABOUT ITS BUSINESS SOLIDLY AND UNROMANTICALLY AND BY THE ORDINARY LAWS OF CHANCE IT ACHIEVES EVERY NOW AND THEN SOMETHING STARTLING AND ROMANTIC SUPERSTITION THRIVES ON THE FACT THAT ONLY THE ACCIDENTAL DRAMAS ARE REPORTED
7502-100425-0020 BUT THERE ARE CHARMS TO SECURE HAPPINESS AS WELL AS CHARMS TO AVERT EVIL IN THESE I AM A FIRM BELIEVER I DO NOT MEAN THAT I BELIEVE THAT A HORSESHOE HUNG UP IN THE HOUSE WILL BRING ME GOOD LUCK
