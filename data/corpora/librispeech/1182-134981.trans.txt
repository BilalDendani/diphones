1182-134981-0000 THE GOOSE GIRL ONCE UPON A TIME AN OLD QUEEN WHOSE HUSBAND HAD BEEN DEAD FOR MANY YEARS HAD A BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER WHEN SHE GREW UP SHE WAS BETROTHED TO A PRINCE WHO LIVED A GREAT WAY OFF
1182-134981-0001 NOW WHEN THE TIME DREW NEAR FOR HER TO BE MARRIED AND TO DEPART INTO A FOREIGN KINGDOM HER OLD MOTHER GAVE HER MUCH COSTLY BAGGAGE AND MANY ORNAMENTS GOLD AND SILVER
1182-134981-0002 FOR SHE LOVED HER DAUGHTER VERY DEARLY SHE GAVE HER A WAITING MAID ALSO WHO WAS TO RIDE WITH HER AND HAND HER OVER TO THE BRIDEGROOM AND SHE PROVIDED EACH OF THEM WITH A HORSE FOR THE JOURNEY NOW THE PRINCESS'S HORSE WAS CALLED FALADA AND COULD SPEAK
1182-134981-0003 WHEN THE HOUR FOR DEPARTURE DREW NEAR THE OLD MOTHER WENT TO HER BEDROOM AND TAKING A SMALL KNIFE SHE CUT HER FINGERS TILL THEY BLED THEN SHE HELD A WHITE RAG UNDER THEM AND LETTING THREE DROPS OF BLOOD FALL INTO IT SHE GAVE IT TO HER DAUGHTER AND SAID
1182-134981-0004 DEAR CHILD TAKE GREAT CARE OF THIS RAG IT MAY BE OF USE TO YOU ON THE JOURNEY SO THEY TOOK A SAD FAREWELL OF EACH OTHER AND THE PRINCESS STUCK THE RAG IN FRONT OF HER DRESS MOUNTED HER HORSE
1182-134981-0005 AND SET FORTH ON THE JOURNEY TO HER BRIDEGROOM'S KINGDOM AFTER THEY HAD RIDDEN FOR ABOUT AN HOUR THE PRINCESS BEGAN TO FEEL VERY THIRSTY AND SAID TO HER WAITING MAID PRAY GET DOWN AND FETCH ME SOME WATER IN MY GOLDEN CUP OUT OF YONDER STREAM I WOULD LIKE A DRINK
1182-134981-0006 IF YOU'RE THIRSTY SAID THE MAID DISMOUNT YOURSELF AND LIE DOWN BY THE WATER AND DRINK I DON'T MEAN TO BE YOUR SERVANT ANY LONGER THE PRINCESS WAS SO THIRSTY THAT SHE GOT DOWN
1182-134981-0007 BENT OVER THE STREAM AND DRANK FOR SHE WASN'T ALLOWED TO DRINK OUT OF THE GOLDEN GOBLET AS SHE DRANK SHE MURMURED OH HEAVEN WHAT AM I TO DO AND THE THREE DROPS OF BLOOD REPLIED IF YOUR MOTHER ONLY KNEW
1182-134981-0008 HER HEART WOULD SURELY BREAK IN TWO BUT THE PRINCESS WAS MEEK AND SAID NOTHING ABOUT HER MAID'S RUDE BEHAVIOR AND QUIETLY MOUNTED HER HORSE AGAIN THEY RODE ON THEIR WAY FOR SEVERAL MILES BUT THE DAY WAS HOT
1182-134981-0009 PRAY GET DOWN AND GIVE ME A DRINK FROM MY GOLDEN CUP FOR SHE HAD LONG AGO FORGOTTEN HER MAID'S RUDE WORDS
1182-134981-0010 IF YOU WANT A DRINK YOU CAN DISMOUNT AND GET IT I DON'T MEAN TO BE YOUR SERVANT THEN THE PRINCESS WAS COMPELLED BY HER THIRST TO GET DOWN AND BENDING OVER THE FLOWING WATER SHE CRIED AND SAID OH HEAVEN WHAT AM I TO DO
1182-134981-0011 AND THE THREE DROPS OF BLOOD REPLIED IF YOUR MOTHER ONLY KNEW HER HEART WOULD SURELY BREAK IN TWO AND AS SHE DRANK THUS AND LEANED RIGHT OVER THE WATER THE RAG CONTAINING THE THREE DROPS OF BLOOD FELL FROM HER BOSOM AND FLOATED DOWN THE STREAM
1182-134981-0012 AND SHE IN HER ANXIETY NEVER EVEN NOTICED HER LOSS BUT THE WAITING MAID HAD OBSERVED IT WITH DELIGHT AS SHE KNEW IT GAVE HER POWER OVER THE BRIDE FOR IN LOSING THE DROPS OF BLOOD THE PRINCESS HAD BECOME WEAK AND POWERLESS
1182-134981-0013 WHEN SHE WISHED TO GET ON HER HORSE FALADA AGAIN THE WAITING MAID CALLED OUT I MEAN TO RIDE FALADA
1182-134981-0014 AND THIS TOO SHE HAD TO SUBMIT TO THEN THE WAITING MAID COMMANDED HER HARSHLY TO TAKE OFF HER ROYAL ROBES
1182-134981-0015 AND FINALLY SHE MADE HER SWEAR BY HEAVEN NOT TO SAY A WORD ABOUT THE MATTER WHEN THEY REACHED THE PALACE AND IF SHE HADN'T TAKEN THIS OATH
1182-134981-0016 BUT FALADA OBSERVED EVERYTHING AND LAID IT ALL TO HEART THE WAITING MAID NOW MOUNTED FALADA AND THE REAL BRIDE THE WORSE HORSE AND SO THEY CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY TILL AT LENGTH THEY ARRIVED AT THE PALACE YARD
1182-134981-0017 THERE WAS GREAT REJOICING OVER THE ARRIVAL AND THE PRINCE SPRANG FORWARD TO MEET THEM AND TAKING THE WAITING MAID FOR HIS BRIDE HE LIFTED HER DOWN FROM HER HORSE AND LED HER UPSTAIRS TO THE ROYAL CHAMBER IN THE MEANTIME THE REAL PRINCESS WAS LEFT STANDING BELOW IN THE COURTYARD
1182-134981-0018 THE OLD KING WHO WAS LOOKING OUT OF HIS WINDOW BEHELD HER IN THIS PLIGHT AND IT STRUCK HIM HOW SWEET AND GENTLE EVEN BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED
1182-134981-0019 AND HAD LEFT THUS STANDING IN THE COURT BELOW OH REPLIED THE BRIDE I BROUGHT HER WITH ME TO KEEP ME COMPANY ON THE JOURNEY
1182-134981-0020 BUT THE OLD KING HAD NO WORK FOR HER AND COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING SO HE SAID I'VE A SMALL BOY WHO LOOKS AFTER THE GEESE SHE'D BETTER HELP HIM THE YOUTH'S NAME WAS CURDKEN
1182-134981-0021 AND THE REAL BRIDE WAS MADE TO ASSIST HIM IN HERDING GEESE SOON AFTER THIS THE FALSE BRIDE SAID TO THE PRINCE DEAREST HUSBAND I PRAY YOU GRANT ME A FAVOR HE ANSWERED THAT I WILL
1182-134981-0022 THEN LET THE SLAUGHTERER CUT OFF THE HEAD OF THE HORSE I RODE HERE UPON
1182-134981-0023 BUT THE TRUTH WAS SHE WAS AFRAID LEST THE HORSE SHOULD SPEAK AND TELL HOW SHE HAD TREATED THE PRINCESS SHE CARRIED HER POINT AND THE FAITHFUL FALADA WAS DOOMED TO DIE WHEN THE NEWS CAME TO THE EARS OF THE REAL PRINCESS SHE WENT TO THE SLAUGHTERER
1182-134981-0024 AND SECRETLY PROMISED HIM A PIECE OF GOLD IF HE WOULD DO SOMETHING FOR HER THERE WAS IN THE TOWN A LARGE DARK GATE THROUGH WHICH SHE HAD TO PASS NIGHT AND MORNING WITH THE GEESE WOULD HE KINDLY HANG UP FALADA'S HEAD THERE THAT SHE MIGHT SEE IT ONCE AGAIN
1182-134981-0025 THE SLAUGHTERER SAID HE WOULD DO AS SHE DESIRED CHOPPED OFF THE HEAD AND NAILED IT FIRMLY OVER THE GATEWAY
1182-134981-0026 AS SHE AND CURDKEN WERE DRIVING THEIR FLOCK THROUGH THE GATE SHE SAID AS SHE PASSED UNDER OH FALADA TIS YOU HANG THERE AND THE HEAD REPLIED TIS YOU PASS UNDER PRINCESS FAIR IF YOUR MOTHER ONLY KNEW HER HEART WOULD SURELY BREAK IN TWO
1182-134981-0027 AND WHEN THEY HAD REACHED THE COMMON WHERE THE GEESE FED SHE SAT DOWN AND UNLOOSED HER HAIR WHICH WAS OF PURE GOLD CURDKEN LOVED TO SEE IT GLITTER IN THE SUN AND WANTED MUCH TO PULL SOME HAIR OUT THEN SHE SPOKE WIND WIND GENTLY SWAY
1182-134981-0028 BLOW CURDKEN'S HAT AWAY LET HIM CHASE O'ER FIELD AND WOLD TILL MY LOCKS OF RUDDY GOLD NOW ASTRAY AND HANGING DOWN BE COMBED AND PLAITED IN A CROWN THEN A GUST OF WIND BLEW CURDKEN'S HAT AWAY AND HE HAD TO CHASE IT OVER HILL AND DALE
1182-134981-0029 TIS YOU PASS UNDER PRINCESS FAIR IF YOUR MOTHER ONLY KNEW HER HEART WOULD SURELY BREAK IN TWO THEN SHE WENT ON HER WAY TILL SHE CAME TO THE COMMON WHERE SHE SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO COMB OUT HER HAIR
1182-134981-0030 THEN CURDKEN RAN UP TO HER AND WANTED TO GRASP SOME OF THE HAIR FROM HER HEAD BUT SHE CALLED OUT HASTILY WIND WIND GENTLY SWAY BLOW CURDKEN'S HAT AWAY LET HIM CHASE O'ER FIELD AND WOLD TILL MY LOCKS OF RUDDY GOLD NOW ASTRAY AND HANGING DOWN BE COMBED AND PLAITED IN A CROWN
1182-134981-0031 THEN A PUFF OF WIND CAME AND BLEW CURDKEN'S HAT FAR AWAY SO THAT HE HAD TO RUN AFTER IT AND WHEN HE RETURNED SHE HAD LONG FINISHED PUTTING UP HER GOLDEN LOCKS AND HE COULDN'T GET ANY HAIR SO THEY WATCHED THE GEESE TILL IT WAS DARK
1182-134981-0032 BUT THAT EVENING WHEN THEY GOT HOME CURDKEN WENT TO THE OLD KING AND SAID I REFUSE TO HERD GEESE ANY LONGER WITH THAT GIRL FOR WHAT REASON ASKED THE OLD KING BECAUSE SHE DOES NOTHING BUT ANNOY ME ALL DAY LONG REPLIED CURDKEN
1182-134981-0033 AND HE PROCEEDED TO RELATE ALL HER INIQUITIES AND SAID EVERY MORNING AS WE DRIVE THE FLOCK THROUGH THE DARK GATE SHE SAYS TO A HORSE'S HEAD THAT HANGS ON THE WALL
1182-134981-0034 AND CURDKEN WENT ON TO TELL WHAT PASSED ON THE COMMON WHERE THE GEESE FED AND HOW HE HAD ALWAYS TO CHASE HIS HAT THE OLD KING BADE HIM GO AND DRIVE FORTH HIS FLOCK AS USUAL NEXT DAY AND WHEN MORNING CAME
1182-134981-0035 HE HIMSELF TOOK UP HIS POSITION BEHIND THE DARK GATE AND HEARD HOW THE GOOSE GIRL GREETED FALADA THEN HE FOLLOWED HER THROUGH THE FIELD AND HID HIMSELF BEHIND A BUSH ON THE COMMON
1182-134981-0036 AND HOW AFTER A TIME THE MAIDEN SAT DOWN AND LOOSED HER HAIR THAT GLITTERED LIKE GOLD AND REPEATED WIND WIND GENTLY SWAY BLOW CURDKEN'S HAT AWAY LET HIM CHASE O'ER FIELD AND WOLD

1182-134981-0038 ALL THIS THE OLD KING OBSERVED AND RETURNED TO THE PALACE WITHOUT ANYONE HAVING NOTICED HIM IN THE EVENING WHEN THE GOOSE GIRL CAME HOME HE CALLED HER ASIDE AND ASKED HER WHY SHE BEHAVED AS SHE DID I MAY NOT TELL YOU WHY HOW DARE I CONFIDE MY WOES TO ANYONE
1182-134981-0039 FOR I SWORE NOT TO BY HEAVEN OTHERWISE I SHOULD HAVE LOST MY LIFE THE OLD KING BEGGED HER TO TELL HIM ALL
1182-134981-0040 AT LAST HE SAID WELL IF YOU WON'T TELL ME CONFIDE YOUR TROUBLE TO THE IRON STOVE THERE AND HE WENT AWAY THEN SHE CREPT TO THE STOVE AND BEGAN TO SOB AND CRY AND TO POUR OUT HER POOR LITTLE HEART AND SAID HERE I SIT DESERTED BY ALL THE WORLD
1182-134981-0041 I WHO AM A KING'S DAUGHTER AND A FALSE WAITING MAID HAS FORCED ME TO TAKE OFF MY OWN CLOTHES AND HAS TAKEN MY PLACE WITH MY BRIDEGROOM WHILE I HAVE TO FULFILL THE LOWLY OFFICE OF GOOSE GIRL IF MY MOTHER ONLY KNEW HER HEART WOULD SURELY BREAK IN TWO
1182-134981-0042 BUT THE OLD KING STOOD OUTSIDE AT THE STOVE CHIMNEY AND LISTENED TO HER WORDS THEN HE ENTERED THE ROOM AGAIN AND BIDDING HER LEAVE THE STOVE HE ORDERED ROYAL APPAREL TO BE PUT ON HER IN WHICH SHE LOOKED AMAZINGLY LOVELY
