4519-80189-0000 THIS INDISCRETION SO UNCHARACTERISTIC WAS DUE TO THE AGITATION OF A SURPRISED MOMENT FOR DUKE'S EXPERIENCE HAD INCLINED HIM TO A PEACEFUL PESSIMISM AND HE HAD NO AMBITION FOR HAZARDOUS UNDERTAKINGS OF ANY SORT
4519-80189-0001 HE WAS GIVEN TO MUSING BUT NOT TO AVOIDABLE ACTION AND HE SEEMED HABITUALLY TO HOPE FOR SOMETHING WHICH HE WAS PRETTY SURE WOULD NOT HAPPEN EVEN IN HIS SLEEP THIS GAVE HIM AN AIR OF WISTFULNESS
4519-80189-0002 THUS BEING ASLEEP IN A NOOK BEHIND THE METAL REFUSE CAN WHEN THE STRANGE CAT VENTURED TO ASCEND THE STEPS OF THE PORCH HIS APPEARANCE WAS SO UNWARLIKE THAT THE CAT FELT ENCOURAGED TO EXTEND ITS FIELD OF RECONNAISSANCE
4519-80189-0003 FOR THE COOK HAD BEEN CARELESS AND THE BACKBONE OF A THREE POUND WHITEFISH LAY AT THE FOOT OF THE REFUSE CAN THIS CAT WAS FOR A CAT NEEDLESSLY TALL POWERFUL INDEPENDENT AND MASCULINE ONCE LONG AGO
4519-80189-0004 HE HAD BEEN A ROLY POLY PEPPER AND SALT KITTEN HE HAD A HOME IN THOSE DAYS AND A NAME GIPSY WHICH HE ABUNDANTLY JUSTIFIED HE WAS PRECOCIOUS IN DISSIPATION
4519-80189-0005 LONG BEFORE HIS ADOLESCENCE HIS LACK OF DOMESTICITY WAS OMINOUS AND HE HAD FORMED BAD COMPANIONSHIPS MEANWHILE HE GREW SO RANGY AND DEVELOPED SUCH LENGTH AND POWER OF LEG AND SUCH TRAITS OF CHARACTER
4519-80189-0006 THAT THE FATHER OF THE LITTLE GIRL WHO OWNED HIM WAS ALMOST CONVINCING WHEN HE DECLARED THAT THE YOUNG CAT WAS HALF BRONCHO AND HALF MALAY PIRATE THOUGH IN THE LIGHT OF GIPSY'S LATER CAREER THIS SEEMS BITTERLY UNFAIR TO EVEN THE LOWEST ORDERS OF BRONCHOS AND MALAY PIRATES
4519-80189-0007 NO GIPSY WAS NOT THE PET FOR A LITTLE GIRL THE ROSY HEARTHSTONE AND SHELTERED RUG WERE TOO CIRCUMSPECT FOR HIM SURROUNDED BY THE COMFORTS OF MIDDLE CLASS RESPECTABILITY
4519-80189-0008 AND PROFOUNDLY OPPRESSED EVEN IN HIS YOUTH BY THE PURITAN IDEALS OF THE HOUSEHOLD HE SOMETIMES EXPERIENCED A SENSE OF SUFFOCATION HE WANTED FREE AIR AND HE WANTED FREE LIFE HE WANTED THE LIGHTS THE LIGHTS AND THE MUSIC
4519-80189-0009 HE ABANDONED THE BOURGEOISIE IRREVOCABLY HE WENT FORTH IN A MAY TWILIGHT CARRYING THE EVENING BEEFSTEAK WITH HIM AND JOINED THE UNDERWORLD HIS EXTRAORDINARY SIZE HIS DARING
4519-80189-0010 AND HIS UTTER LACK OF SYMPATHY SOON MADE HIM THE LEADER AND AT THE SAME TIME THE TERROR OF ALL THE LOOSE LIVED CATS IN A WIDE NEIGHBOURHOOD HE CONTRACTED NO FRIENDSHIPS AND HAD NO CONFIDANTS HE SELDOM SLEPT IN THE SAME PLACE TWICE IN SUCCESSION
4519-80189-0011 AND THOUGH HE WAS WANTED BY THE POLICE HE WAS NOT FOUND IN APPEARANCE HE DID NOT LACK DISTINCTION OF AN OMINOUS SORT THE SLOW RHYTHMIC PERFECTLY CONTROLLED MECHANISM OF HIS TAIL AS HE IMPRESSIVELY WALKED ABROAD WAS INCOMPARABLY SINISTER
4519-80189-0012 THIS STATELY AND DANGEROUS WALK OF HIS HIS LONG VIBRANT WHISKERS HIS SCARS HIS YELLOW EYE SO ICE COLD SO FIRE HOT HAUGHTY AS THE EYE OF SATAN GAVE HIM THE DEADLY AIR OF A MOUSQUETAIRE DUELLIST
4519-80189-0013 HIS SOUL WAS IN THAT WALK AND IN THAT EYE IT COULD BE READ THE SOUL OF A BRAVO OF FORTUNE LIVING ON HIS WITS AND HIS VALOUR ASKING NO FAVOURS AND GRANTING NO QUARTER INTOLERANT PROUD SULLEN
4519-80189-0014 YET WATCHFUL AND CONSTANTLY PLANNING PURELY A MILITARIST BELIEVING IN SLAUGHTER AS IN A RELIGION AND CONFIDENT THAT ART SCIENCE POETRY AND THE GOOD OF THE WORLD WERE HAPPILY ADVANCED THEREBY
4519-80189-0015 GIPSY HAD BECOME THOUGH TECHNICALLY NOT A WILDCAT UNDOUBTEDLY THE MOST UNTAMED CAT AT LARGE IN THE CIVILIZED WORLD SUCH IN BRIEF WAS THE TERRIFYING CREATURE WHICH NOW ELONGATED ITS NECK
4519-80189-0016 AND OVER THE TOP STEP OF THE PORCH BENT A CALCULATING SCRUTINY UPON THE WISTFUL AND SLUMBEROUS DUKE THE SCRUTINY WAS SEARCHING BUT NOT PROLONGED GIPSY MUTTERED CONTEMPTUOUSLY TO HIMSELF OH SHEOL
4519-80189-0017 I'M NOT AFRAID O THAT AND HE APPROACHED THE FISHBONE HIS PADDED FEET MAKING NO NOISE UPON THE BOARDS IT WAS A DESIRABLE FISHBONE LARGE WITH A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE FISH'S TAIL STILL ATTACHED TO IT
4519-80189-0018 IT WAS ABOUT A FOOT FROM DUKE'S NOSE AND THE LITTLE DOG'S DREAMS BEGAN TO BE TROUBLED BY HIS OLFACTORY NERVE THIS FAITHFUL SENTINEL ON GUARD EVEN WHILE DUKE SLEPT SIGNALLED THAT ALARUMS AND EXCURSIONS BY PARTIES UNKNOWN WERE TAKING PLACE
4519-80189-0019 AND SUGGESTED THAT ATTENTION MIGHT WELL BE PAID DUKE
4519-80189-0020 WHAT THAT EYE BEHELD WAS MONSTROUS HERE WAS A STRANGE EXPERIENCE THE HORRIFIC VISION IN THE MIDST OF THINGS SO ACCUSTOMED SUNSHINE FELL SWEETLY UPON PORCH AND BACKYARD
4519-80189-0021 YONDER WAS THE FAMILIAR STABLE AND FROM ITS INTERIOR CAME THE BUSY HUM OF A CARPENTER SHOP ESTABLISHED THAT MORNING BY DUKE'S YOUNG MASTER IN ASSOCIATION WITH SAMUEL WILLIAMS AND HERMAN HERE CLOSE BY WERE THE QUIET REFUSE CAN
4519-80189-0022 AND THE WONTED BROOMS AND MOPS LEANING AGAINST THE LATTICED WALL AT THE END OF THE PORCH AND THERE BY THE FOOT OF THE STEPS WAS THE STONE SLAB OF THE CISTERN WITH THE IRON COVER DISPLACED AND LYING BESIDE THE ROUND OPENING WHERE THE CARPENTERS HAD LEFT IT NOT HALF AN HOUR AGO
4519-80189-0023 AFTER LOWERING A STICK OF WOOD INTO THE WATER TO SEASON IT ALL ABOUT DUKE WERE THESE USUAL AND REASSURING ENVIRONS OF HIS DAILY LIFE AND YET IT WAS HIS FATE TO BEHOLD RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THEM AND IN GHASTLY JUXTAPOSITION TO HIS FACE
4519-80189-0024 A THING OF NIGHTMARE AND LUNACY GIPSY HAD SEIZED THE FISHBONE BY THE MIDDLE OUT FROM ONE SIDE OF HIS HEAD AND MINGLING WITH HIS WHISKERS PROJECTED THE LONG SPIKED SPINE OF THE BIG FISH DOWN FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT FEROCIOUS HEAD DANGLED THE FISH'S TAIL
4519-80189-0025 AND FROM ABOVE THE REMARKABLE EFFECT THUS PRODUCED SHOT THE INTOLERABLE GLARE OF TWO YELLOW EYES TO THE GAZE OF DUKE STILL BLURRED BY SLUMBER THIS MONSTROSITY WAS ALL OF ONE PIECE THE BONE SEEMED A LIVING PART OF IT
4519-80189-0026 THERE WAS NO MAGNIFYING GLASS BETWEEN HIM AND THIS SPINED AND SPIKY FACE INDEED DUKE WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO THINK THE MATTER OVER QUIETLY IF HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT HE WOULD HAVE SAID TO HIMSELF
4519-80189-0027 WE HAVE HERE AN ANIMAL OF MOST PECULIAR AND UNATTRACTIVE APPEARANCE THOUGH UPON EXAMINATION IT SEEMS TO BE ONLY A CAT STEALING A FISHBONE NEVERTHELESS AS THE THIEF IS LARGE BEYOND ALL MY RECOLLECTION OF CATS
4519-80189-0028 AND HAS AN UNPLEASANT STARE I WILL LEAVE THIS SPOT AT ONCE ON THE CONTRARY DUKE WAS SO ELECTRIFIED BY HIS HORRID AWAKENING THAT HE COMPLETELY LOST HIS PRESENCE OF MIND IN THE VERY INSTANT OF HIS FIRST EYE'S OPENING
4519-80189-0029 THE OTHER EYE AND HIS MOUTH BEHAVED SIMILARLY THE LATTER LOOSING UPON THE QUIET AIR ONE SHRIEK OF MENTAL AGONY BEFORE THE LITTLE DOG SCRAMBLED TO HIS FEET AND GAVE FURTHER EMPLOYMENT TO HIS VOICE IN A FRENZY OF PROFANITY
4519-80189-0030 IT ROSE TO A WAIL AND ROSE AND ROSE AGAIN TILL IT SCREAMED LIKE A SMALL SIREN IT WAS GIPSY'S WAR CRY AND AT THE SOUND OF IT DUKE BECAME A FROTHING MANIAC
4519-80189-0031 HE MADE A CONVULSIVE FRONTAL ATTACK UPON THE HOBGOBLIN AND THE MASSACRE BEGAN NEVER RELEASING THE FISHBONE FOR AN INSTANT GIPSY LAID BACK HIS EARS IN A CHILLING WAY BEGINNING TO SHRINK INTO HIMSELF LIKE A CONCERTINA
4519-80189-0032 BUT RISING AMIDSHIPS SO HIGH THAT HE APPEARED TO BE GIVING AN IMITATION OF THAT PEACEFUL BEAST THE DROMEDARY SUCH WAS NOT HIS PURPOSE HOWEVER FOR HAVING ATTAINED HIS GREATEST POSSIBLE ALTITUDE HE PARTIALLY SAT DOWN
4519-80189-0033 AND ELEVATED HIS RIGHT ARM AFTER THE MANNER OF A SEMAPHORE THIS SEMAPHORE ARM REMAINED RIGID FOR A SECOND THREATENING THEN IT VIBRATED WITH INCONCEIVABLE RAPIDITY FEINTING BUT IT WAS THE TREACHEROUS LEFT THAT DID THE WORK
4519-80189-0034 SEEMINGLY THIS LEFT GAVE DUKE THREE LIGHTNING LITTLE PATS UPON THE RIGHT EAR BUT THE CHANGE IN HIS VOICE INDICATED THAT THESE WERE NO LOVE TAPS HE YELLED HELP AND BLOODY MURDER NEVER HAD SUCH A SHATTERING UPROAR ALL VOCAL
4519-80189-0035 BROKEN OUT UPON A PEACEFUL AFTERNOON GIPSY POSSESSED A VOCABULARY FOR CAT SWEARING CERTAINLY SECOND TO NONE OUT OF ITALY AND PROBABLY EQUAL TO THE BEST THERE WHILE DUKE REMEMBERED AND UTTERED THINGS HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF FOR YEARS
4519-80189-0036 THE HUM OF THE CARPENTER SHOP CEASED AND SAM WILLIAMS APPEARED IN THE STABLE DOORWAY HE STARED INSANELY MY GORRY HE SHOUTED DUKE'S HAVIN A FIGHT WITH THE BIGGEST CAT YOU EVER SAW IN YOUR LIFE C'MON
4519-80189-0037 HIS FEET WERE ALREADY IN MOTION TOWARD THE BATTLEFIELD WITH PENROD AND HERMAN HURRYING IN HIS WAKE ONWARD THEY SPED AND DUKE WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE SIGHT AND SOUND OF THESE REINFORCEMENTS
4519-80189-0038 TO INCREASE HIS OWN OUTRAGEOUS CLAMOURS AND TO PRESS HOME HIS ATTACK BUT HE WAS ILL ADVISED THIS TIME IT WAS THE RIGHT ARM OF THE SEMAPHORE THAT DIPPED AND DUKE'S HONEST NOSE WAS BUT TOO CONSCIOUS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN CONSEQUENCE
4519-80189-0039 A LUMP OF DIRT STRUCK THE REFUSE CAN WITH VIOLENCE AND GIPSY BEHELD THE ADVANCE OF OVERWHELMING FORCES THEY RUSHED UPON HIM FROM TWO DIRECTIONS CUTTING OFF THE STEPS OF THE PORCH
4519-80189-0040 UNDAUNTED THE FORMIDABLE CAT RAKED DUKE'S NOSE AGAIN SOMEWHAT MORE LINGERINGLY AND PREPARED TO DEPART WITH HIS FISHBONE HE HAD LITTLE FEAR FOR HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS INCLINED TO THINK THAT UNHAMPERED HE COULD WHIP ANYTHING ON EARTH
4519-80189-0041 STILL THINGS SEEMED TO BE GROWING RATHER WARM AND HE SAW NOTHING TO PREVENT HIS LEAVING AND THOUGH HE COULD LAUGH IN THE FACE OF SO UNEQUAL AN ANTAGONIST AS DUKE
4519-80189-0042 OR ABLE TO DO HIMSELF FULL JUSTICE UNLESS HE COULD PERFORM THAT FELINE OPERATION INACCURATELY KNOWN AS SPITTING TO HIS NOTION THIS WAS AN ABSOLUTE ESSENTIAL TO COMBAT
4519-80189-0043 BUT AS ALL CATS OF THE SLIGHTEST PRETENSIONS TO TECHNIQUE PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND IT CAN NEITHER BE WELL DONE NOR PRODUCE THE BEST EFFECTS UNLESS THE MOUTH BE OPENED TO ITS UTMOST CAPACITY
4519-80189-0044 SO AS TO EXPOSE THE BEGINNINGS OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL DOWN WHICH AT LEAST THAT IS THE INTENTION OF THE THREAT THE OPPOSING PARTY WILL SOON BE PASSING AND GIPSY COULD NOT OPEN HIS MOUTH WITHOUT RELINQUISHING HIS FISHBONE
4519-80189-0045 THEREFORE ON SMALL ACCOUNTS HE DECIDED TO LEAVE THE FIELD TO HIS ENEMIES AND TO CARRY THE FISHBONE ELSEWHERE HE TOOK TWO GIANT LEAPS THE FIRST LANDED HIM UPON THE EDGE OF THE PORCH
4519-80189-0046 THERE WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S PAUSE HE GATHERED HIS FUR SHEATHED MUSCLES CONCENTRATED HIMSELF INTO ONE BIG STEEL SPRING AND LAUNCHED HIMSELF SUPERBLY INTO SPACE HE MADE A STIRRING PICTURE HOWEVER BRIEF
4519-80189-0047 AS HE LEFT THE SOLID PORCH BEHIND HIM AND SAILED UPWARD ON AN ASCENDING CURVE INTO THE SUNLIT AIR HIS HEAD WAS PROUDLY UP HE WAS THE INCARNATION OF MENACING POWER AND OF SELF CONFIDENCE
4519-80189-0048 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE WHITE FISH'S SPINAL COLUMN AND FLOPPING TAIL HAD INTERFERED WITH HIS VISION AND IN LAUNCHING HIMSELF HE MAY HAVE MISTAKEN THE DARK ROUND OPENING OF THE CISTERN FOR ITS DARK ROUND COVER
