453-3040-0000 TO THE PUBLIC HAVING HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT MY ADVENTURES HAVE BEEN
453-3040-0001 THIS I HAVE BEEN FORCED INTO IN REGARD OF MY OWN HONOUR
453-3040-0002 AT THE CITY OF LONDON ENGLAND WE THE UNDERSIGNED AS TRUE BELIEVERS IN THE PROFIT DO MOST SOLEMNLY AFFIRM THAT ALL THE ADVENTURES OF OUR FRIEND BARON MUNCHAUSEN IN WHATEVER COUNTRY THEY MAY LIE ARE POSITIVE AND SIMPLE FACTS AND
453-3040-0003 AS WE HAVE BEEN BELIEVED WHOSE ADVENTURES ARE TENFOLD MORE WONDERFUL SO DO WE HOPE ALL TRUE BELIEVERS WILL GIVE HIM THEIR FULL FAITH AND CREDENCE
453-3040-0004 JOHN THE PORTER TRAVELS OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN CHAPTER ONE
453-3040-0005 THE ASTONISHING EFFECTS OF A STORM ARRIVES AT CEYLON COMBATS AND CONQUERS TWO EXTRAORDINARY OPPONENTS RETURNS TO HOLLAND SOME YEARS BEFORE MY BEARD ANNOUNCED APPROACHING MANHOOD OR IN OTHER WORDS WHEN I WAS NEITHER MAN NOR BOY
453-3040-0006 BUT BETWEEN BOTH I EXPRESSED IN REPEATED CONVERSATIONS A STRONG DESIRE OF SEEING THE WORLD FROM WHICH I WAS DISCOURAGED BY MY PARENTS THOUGH MY FATHER HAD BEEN NO INCONSIDERABLE TRAVELLER HIMSELF
453-3040-0007 A COUSIN BY MY MOTHER'S SIDE TOOK A LIKING TO ME OFTEN SAID I WAS FINE FORWARD YOUTH AND WAS MUCH INCLINED TO GRATIFY MY CURIOSITY HIS ELOQUENCE HAD MORE EFFECT THAN MINE FOR MY FATHER CONSENTED TO MY ACCOMPANYING HIM IN A VOYAGE TO THE ISLAND OF CEYLON
453-3040-0008 WE SAILED FROM AMSTERDAM WITH DESPATCHES FROM THEIR HIGH MIGHTINESSES THE STATES OF HOLLAND THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HAPPENED ON OUR VOYAGE WORTH RELATING WAS THE WONDERFUL EFFECTS OF A STORM WHICH HAD TORN UP BY THE ROOTS A GREAT NUMBER OF TREES OF ENORMOUS BULK AND HEIGHT
453-3040-0009 SOME OF THESE TREES WEIGHED MANY TONS YET THEY WERE CARRIED BY THE WIND SO AMAZINGLY HIGH THAT THEY APPEARED LIKE THE FEATHERS OF SMALL BIRDS FLOATING IN THE AIR FOR THEY WERE AT LEAST FIVE MILES ABOVE THE EARTH
453-3040-0010 HOWEVER AS SOON AS THE STORM SUBSIDED THEY ALL FELL PERPENDICULARLY INTO THEIR RESPECTIVE PLACES AND TOOK ROOT AGAIN EXCEPT THE LARGEST WHICH HAPPENED
453-3040-0011 A VERY HONEST OLD COUPLE UPON ITS BRANCHES GATHERING CUCUMBERS IN THIS PART OF THE GLOBE THAT USEFUL VEGETABLE GROWS UPON TREES THE WEIGHT OF THIS COUPLE AS THE TREE DESCENDED OVER BALANCED THE TRUNK
453-3040-0012 AND BROUGHT IT DOWN IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION IT FELL UPON THE CHIEF MAN OF THE ISLAND AND KILLED HIM ON THE SPOT HE HAD QUITTED HIS HOUSE IN THE STORM UNDER AN APPREHENSION OF ITS FALLING UPON HIM AND WAS RETURNING THROUGH HIS OWN GARDEN WHEN THIS FORTUNATE ACCIDENT HAPPENED
453-3040-0013 THE WORD FORTUNATE HERE REQUIRES SOME EXPLANATION THIS CHIEF WAS A MAN OF A VERY AVARICIOUS AND OPPRESSIVE DISPOSITION AND THOUGH HE HAD NO FAMILY THE NATIVES OF THE ISLAND WERE HALF STARVED BY HIS OPPRESSIVE AND INFAMOUS IMPOSITIONS
453-3040-0014 THE VERY GOODS WHICH HE HAD THUS TAKEN FROM THEM WERE SPOILING IN HIS STORES
453-3040-0015 THOUGH THE DESTRUCTION OF THIS TYRANT WAS ACCIDENTAL THE PEOPLE CHOSE THE CUCUMBER GATHERERS FOR THEIR GOVERNORS AS A MARK OF THEIR GRATITUDE FOR DESTROYING THOUGH ACCIDENTALLY
453-3040-0016 AFTER WE HAD REPAIRED THE DAMAGES WE SUSTAINED IN THIS REMARKABLE STORM AND TAKEN LEAVE OF THE NEW GOVERNOR AND HIS LADY
453-3040-0017 THE FOLLOWING SINGULAR ADVENTURES MAY NOT PROVE UNENTERTAINING AFTER WE HAD RESIDED AT CEYLON ABOUT A FORTNIGHT I ACCOMPANIED ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BROTHERS UPON A SHOOTING PARTY
453-3040-0018 HE WAS A STRONG ATHLETIC MAN AND BEING USED TO THAT CLIMATE FOR HE HAD RESIDED THERE SOME YEARS HE BORE THE VIOLENT HEAT OF THE SUN MUCH BETTER THAN I COULD IN OUR EXCURSION HE HAD MADE A CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS THROUGH A THICK WOOD WHEN I WAS ONLY AT THE ENTRANCE
453-3040-0019 I THOUGHT I HEARD A RUSTLING NOISE BEHIND ON TURNING ABOUT I WAS ALMOST PETRIFIED AS WHO WOULD NOT BE AT THE SIGHT OF A LION WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY APPROACHING WITH THE INTENTION OF SATISFYING HIS APPETITE WITH MY POOR CARCASE
453-3040-0020 AND THAT WITHOUT ASKING MY CONSENT WHAT WAS TO BE DONE IN THIS HORRIBLE DILEMMA
453-3040-0021 AND I HAD NO OTHER ABOUT ME HOWEVER THOUGH I COULD HAVE NO IDEA OF KILLING SUCH AN ANIMAL WITH THAT WEAK KIND OF AMMUNITION YET I HAD SOME HOPES OF FRIGHTENING HIM BY THE REPORT AND PERHAPS OF WOUNDING HIM ALSO I IMMEDIATELY LET FLY WITHOUT WAITING TILL HE WAS WITHIN REACH
453-3040-0022 ABOUT I FOUND A LARGE CROCODILE WITH HIS MOUTH EXTENDED ALMOST READY TO RECEIVE ME ON MY RIGHT HAND WAS THE PIECE OF WATER BEFORE MENTIONED AND ON MY LEFT A DEEP PRECIPICE SAID TO HAVE
453-3040-0023 AS I HAVE SINCE LEARNED A RECEPTACLE AT THE BOTTOM FOR VENOMOUS CREATURES IN SHORT I GAVE MYSELF UP AS LOST FOR THE LION WAS NOW UPON HIS HIND LEGS JUST IN THE ACT OF SEIZING ME I FELL INVOLUNTARILY TO THE GROUND WITH FEAR
453-3040-0024 AND AS IT AFTERWARDS APPEARED HE SPRANG OVER ME I LAY SOME TIME IN A SITUATION WHICH NO LANGUAGE CAN DESCRIBE EXPECTING TO FEEL HIS TEETH OR TALONS
453-3040-0025 I HEARD A VIOLENT BUT UNUSUAL NOISE DIFFERENT FROM ANY SOUND THAT HAD EVER BEFORE ASSAILED MY EARS
453-3040-0026 I VENTURED TO RAISE MY HEAD AND LOOK ROUND WHEN
453-3040-0027 WHICH AS BEFORE OBSERVED WAS WIDE OPEN THE HEAD OF THE ONE STUCK IN THE THROAT OF THE OTHER AND THEY WERE STRUGGLING TO EXTRICATE THEMSELVES I FORTUNATELY RECOLLECTED MY COUTEAU DE CHASSE
453-3040-0028 AND DESTROYED HIM BY SUFFOCATION FOR HE COULD NEITHER GORGE NOR EJECT IT
453-3040-0029 MY COMPANION ARRIVED IN SEARCH OF ME FOR FINDING I DID NOT FOLLOW HIM INTO THE WOOD HE RETURNED APPREHENDING I HAD LOST MY WAY OR MET WITH SOME ACCIDENT AFTER MUTUAL CONGRATULATIONS WE MEASURED THE CROCODILE WHICH WAS JUST
