4039-184264-0000 I WILL NOT AS I MIGHT POINT TO THE STRONG MORAL PURPOSE OF THIS POEM ITSELF TO THE ARITHMETICAL PRINCIPLES SO CAUTIOUSLY INCULCATED IN IT OR TO ITS NOBLE TEACHINGS IN NATURAL HISTORY
4039-184264-0001 OF SIMPLY EXPLAINING HOW IT HAPPENED THE BELLMAN WHO WAS ALMOST MORBIDLY SENSITIVE ABOUT APPEARANCES USED TO HAVE THE BOWSPRIT UNSHIPPED ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK TO BE REVARNISHED AND IT MORE THAN ONCE HAPPENED WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR REPLACING IT
4039-184264-0002 HE KNEW IT WAS ALL WRONG BUT ALAS RULE FORTY TWO OF THE CODE NO ONE SHALL SPEAK TO THE MAN AT THE HELM HAD BEEN COMPLETED BY THE BELLMAN HIMSELF WITH THE WORDS AND THE MAN AT THE HELM SHALL SPEAK TO NO ONE SO REMONSTRANCE WAS IMPOSSIBLE
4039-184264-0003 AND NO STEERING COULD BE DONE TILL THE NEXT VARNISHING DAY DURING THESE BEWILDERING INTERVALS THE SHIP USUALLY SAILED BACKWARDS AS THIS POEM IS TO SOME EXTENT CONNECTED WITH THE LAY OF THE JABBERWOCK LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY OF ANSWERING A QUESTION THAT HAS OFTEN BEEN ASKED ME
4039-184264-0004 HUMPTY DUMPTY'S THEORY OF TWO MEANINGS PACKED INTO ONE WORD LIKE A PORTMANTEAU SEEMS TO ME THE RIGHT EXPLANATION FOR ALL FOR INSTANCE TAKE THE TWO WORDS FUMING AND FURIOUS MAKE UP YOUR MIND THAT YOU WILL SAY BOTH WORDS BUT LEAVE IT UNSETTLED
4039-184264-0005 NOW OPEN YOUR MOUTH AND SPEAK IF YOUR THOUGHTS INCLINE EVER SO LITTLE TOWARDS FUMING YOU WILL SAY FUMING FURIOUS IF THEY TURN BY EVEN A HAIR'S BREADTH TOWARDS FURIOUS YOU WILL SAY FURIOUS FUMING BUT
4039-184264-0006 A PERFECTLY BALANCED MIND YOU WILL SAY FRUMIOUS SUPPOSING THAT WHEN PISTOL UTTERED THE WELL KNOWN WORDS UNDER WHICH KING BEZONIAN SPEAK OR DIE
4039-184264-0007 JUSTICE SHALLOW HAD FELT CERTAIN THAT IT WAS EITHER WILLIAM OR RICHARD BUT
4039-184264-0008 CAN IT BE DOUBTED THAT RATHER THAN DIE HE WOULD HAVE GASPED OUT RILCHIAM FIT THE FIRST THE LANDING
4039-184264-0009 JUST THE PLACE FOR A SNARK THE BELLMAN CRIED AS HE LANDED HIS CREW WITH CARE SUPPORTING EACH MAN ON THE TOP OF THE TIDE BY A FINGER ENTWINED IN HIS HAIR JUST THE PLACE FOR A SNARK
4039-184264-0010 WHAT I TELL YOU THREE TIMES IS TRUE THE CREW WAS COMPLETE IT INCLUDED A BOOTS A MAKER OF BONNETS AND HOODS A BARRISTER BROUGHT TO ARRANGE THEIR DISPUTES AND A BROKER TO VALUE THEIR GOODS
4039-184264-0011 A BILLIARD MARKER WHOSE SKILL WAS IMMENSE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE WON MORE THAN HIS SHARE BUT A BANKER ENGAGED AT ENORMOUS EXPENSE HAD THE WHOLE OF THEIR CASH IN HIS CARE
4039-184264-0012 THERE WAS ALSO A BEAVER THAT PACED ON THE DECK OR WOULD SIT MAKING LACE IN THE BOW AND HAD OFTEN THE BELLMAN SAID SAVED THEM FROM WRECK THOUGH NONE OF THE SAILORS KNEW HOW
4039-184264-0013 THERE WAS ONE WHO WAS FAMED FOR THE NUMBER OF THINGS HE FORGOT WHEN HE ENTERED THE SHIP HIS UMBRELLA HIS WATCH ALL HIS JEWELS AND RINGS AND THE CLOTHES HE HAD BOUGHT FOR THE TRIP
4039-184264-0014 THE LOSS OF HIS CLOTHES HARDLY MATTERED BECAUSE HE HAD SEVEN COATS ON WHEN HE CAME WITH THREE PAIRS OF BOOTS BUT THE WORST OF IT WAS HE HAD WHOLLY FORGOTTEN HIS NAME HE WOULD ANSWER TO HI
4039-184264-0015 TO WHAT YOU MAY CALL UM OR WHAT WAS HIS NAME BUT ESPECIALLY THING UM A JIG WHILE FOR THOSE WHO PREFERRED A MORE FORCIBLE WORD HE HAD DIFFERENT NAMES FROM THESE
4039-184264-0016 HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS CALLED HIM CANDLE ENDS AND HIS ENEMIES TOASTED CHEESE HIS FORM IS UNGAINLY HIS INTELLECT SMALL SO THE BELLMAN WOULD OFTEN REMARK
4039-184264-0017 BUT HIS COURAGE IS PERFECT AND THAT AFTER ALL IS THE THING THAT ONE NEEDS WITH A SNARK HE WOULD JOKE WITH HYENAS RETURNING THEIR STARE WITH AN IMPUDENT WAG OF THE HEAD AND HE ONCE WENT A WALK
4039-184264-0018 NO MATERIALS WERE TO BE HAD THE LAST OF THE CREW NEEDS ESPECIAL REMARK THOUGH HE LOOKED AN INCREDIBLE DUNCE HE HAD JUST ONE IDEA BUT THAT ONE BEING SNARK
4039-184264-0019 THE GOOD BELLMAN ENGAGED HIM AT ONCE HE CAME AS A BUTCHER BUT GRAVELY DECLARED WHEN THE SHIP HAD BEEN SAILING A WEEK HE COULD ONLY KILL BEAVERS THE BELLMAN LOOKED SCARED AND WAS
4039-184264-0020 ALMOST TOO FRIGHTENED TO SPEAK BUT AT LENGTH HE EXPLAINED IN A TREMULOUS TONE THERE WAS ONLY ONE BEAVER ON BOARD AND THAT WAS A TAME ONE HE HAD OF HIS OWN WHOSE DEATH WOULD BE DEEPLY DEPLORED
4039-184264-0021 THE BEAVER WHO HAPPENED TO HEAR THE REMARK PROTESTED WITH TEARS IN ITS EYES THAT NOT EVEN THE RAPTURE OF HUNTING THE SNARK COULD ATONE FOR THAT DISMAL SURPRISE
4039-184264-0022 IT STRONGLY ADVISED THAT THE BUTCHER SHOULD BE CONVEYED IN A SEPARATE SHIP
4039-184264-0023 NAVIGATION WAS ALWAYS A DIFFICULT ART THOUGH WITH ONLY ONE SHIP AND ONE BELL AND HE FEARED HE MUST REALLY DECLINE FOR HIS PART UNDERTAKING ANOTHER AS WELL
4039-184264-0024 THE BEAVER'S BEST COURSE WAS NO DOUBT TO PROCURE A SECOND HAND DAGGER PROOF COAT SO THE BAKER ADVISED IT AND NEXT TO INSURE ITS LIFE IN SOME OFFICE OF NOTE
4039-184264-0025 THIS THE BANKER SUGGESTED AND OFFERED FOR HIRE ON MODERATE TERMS OR FOR SALE TWO EXCELLENT POLICIES ONE AGAINST FIRE AND ONE AGAINST DAMAGE FROM HAIL
4039-184264-0026 YET STILL EVER AFTER THAT SORROWFUL DAY WHENEVER THE BUTCHER WAS BY THE BEAVER KEPT LOOKING THE OPPOSITE WAY AND APPEARED UNACCOUNTABLY SHY
4039-184264-0027 FIT THE SECOND THE BELLMAN'S SPEECH THE BELLMAN HIMSELF THEY ALL PRAISED TO THE SKIES SUCH A CARRIAGE SUCH
4039-184264-0028 EASE AND SUCH GRACE SUCH SOLEMNITY TOO ONE COULD SEE HE WAS WISE THE MOMENT ONE LOOKED IN HIS FACE HE HAD BOUGHT A LARGE MAP REPRESENTING THE SEA WITHOUT THE LEAST VESTIGE OF LAND
4039-184264-0029 AND THE CREW WERE MUCH PLEASED WHEN THEY FOUND IT TO BE A MAP THEY COULD ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT'S THE GOOD OF MERCATOR'S NORTH POLES AND EQUATORS TROPICS ZONES AND MERIDIAN LINES
4039-184264-0030 SO THE BELLMAN WOULD CRY AND THE CREW WOULD REPLY THEY ARE MERELY CONVENTIONAL SIGNS OTHER MAPS ARE SUCH SHAPES WITH THEIR ISLANDS AND CAPES BUT WE'VE GOT OUR BRAVE CAPTAIN TO THANK SO THE CREW WOULD PROTEST
4039-184264-0031 THAT HE'S BOUGHT US THE BEST A PERFECT AND ABSOLUTE BLANK THIS WAS CHARMING NO DOUBT BUT THEY SHORTLY FOUND OUT THAT THE CAPTAIN THEY TRUSTED SO WELL HAD ONLY ONE NOTION FOR CROSSING THE OCEAN
4039-184264-0032 AND THAT WAS TO TINGLE HIS BELL HE WAS THOUGHTFUL AND GRAVE BUT THE ORDERS HE GAVE WERE ENOUGH TO BEWILDER A CREW WHEN HE CRIED STEER TO STARBOARD BUT KEEP HER HEAD LARBOARD
4039-184264-0033 WHAT ON EARTH WAS THE HELMSMAN TO DO THEN THE BOWSPRIT GOT MIXED WITH THE RUDDER SOMETIMES A THING AS THE BELLMAN REMARKED THAT FREQUENTLY HAPPENS IN TROPICAL CLIMES WHEN A VESSEL IS
4039-184264-0034 SO TO SPEAK SNARKED BUT THE PRINCIPAL FAILING OCCURRED IN THE SAILING AND THE BELLMAN PERPLEXED AND DISTRESSED SAID HE HAD HOPED AT LEAST WHEN THE WIND BLEW DUE EAST
4039-184264-0035 THAT THE SHIP WOULD NOT TRAVEL DUE WEST BUT THE DANGER WAS PAST THEY HAD LANDED AT LAST WITH THEIR BOXES PORTMANTEAUS AND BAGS YET AT FIRST SIGHT THE CREW WERE NOT PLEASED WITH THE VIEW
4039-184264-0036 WHICH CONSISTED OF CHASMS AND CRAGS THE BELLMAN PERCEIVED THAT THEIR SPIRITS WERE LOW AND REPEATED IN MUSICAL TONE SOME JOKES HE HAD KEPT FOR A SEASON OF WOE
4039-184264-0037 BUT THE CREW WOULD DO NOTHING BUT GROAN HE SERVED OUT SOME GROG WITH A LIBERAL HAND AND BADE THEM SIT DOWN ON THE BEACH AND THEY COULD NOT BUT OWN THAT THEIR CAPTAIN LOOKED GRAND AS HE STOOD
4039-184264-0038 AND DELIVERED HIS SPEECH FRIENDS ROMANS AND COUNTRYMEN LEND ME YOUR EARS THEY WERE ALL OF THEM FOND OF QUOTATIONS SO THEY DRANK TO HIS HEALTH AND THEY GAVE HIM THREE CHEERS WHILE HE SERVED OUT ADDITIONAL RATIONS
4039-184264-0039 SEVEN DAYS TO THE WEEK I ALLOW BUT A SNARK ON THE WHICH WE MIGHT LOVINGLY GAZE WE HAVE NEVER BEHELD TILL NOW COME LISTEN MY MEN WHILE I TELL YOU AGAIN
4039-184264-0040 THE FIVE UNMISTAKABLE MARKS BY WHICH YOU MAY KNOW WHERESOEVER YOU GO THE WARRANTED GENUINE SNARKS LET US TAKE THEM IN ORDER THE FIRST IS THE TASTE WHICH IS MEAGRE
4039-184264-0041 AND HOLLOW BUT CRISP LIKE A COAT THAT IS RATHER TOO TIGHT IN THE WAIST WITH A FLAVOUR OF WILL O' THE WISP ITS HABIT OF GETTING UP LATE YOU'LL AGREE THAT IT CARRIES TOO FAR WHEN I SAY
4039-184264-0042 THAT IT FREQUENTLY BREAKFASTS AT FIVE O'CLOCK TEA AND DINES ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE THIRD IS ITS SLOWNESS IN TAKING A JEST SHOULD YOU HAPPEN TO VENTURE ON ONE IT WILL SIGH LIKE A THING THAT IS
4039-184264-0043 DEEPLY DISTRESSED AND IT ALWAYS LOOKS GRAVE AT A PUN THE FOURTH
4039-184264-0044 AND BELIEVES THAT THEY ADD TO THE BEAUTY OF SCENES A SENTIMENT OPEN TO DOUBT THE FIFTH IS AMBITION IT NEXT WILL BE RIGHT TO DESCRIBE EACH PARTICULAR BATCH
4039-184264-0045 DISTINGUISHING THOSE THAT HAVE FEATHERS AND BITE
