7294-92934-0000 GRACE DARLING THE COAST OF NORTHUMBERLAND IN ENGLAND IS ROCKY AND SEVERE WITH LOFTY FLINT LEDGED CLIFFS WHERE GREAT WAVES THUNDER HURLING THE WHITE FOAM HIGH INTO THE AIR
7294-92934-0001 IT IS A COAST THAT IS FEARED BY VESSELS AND MANY WRECKS HAVE TAKEN PLACE THERE AS IS USUAL IN SUCH A LOCALITY IT IS THE HOME OF BRAVE FISHERMEN AND DARING BOATMEN
7294-92934-0002 THE BRAVEST OF ALL WAS PERFORMED BY A GIRL WHOSE NAME WAS GRACE DARLING A NAME THAT NOW IS KNOWN NOT ONLY IN THE PLACES WHERE SHE LIVED BUT ALL OVER THE WORLD GRACE HORSLEY DARLING
7294-92934-0003 WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER NAMED WILLIAM DARLING WHO TENDED A LIGHT ON ONE OF THE FARNE ISLANDS AS HIS FATHER HAD DONE BEFORE HIM GRACE WHO WAS THE SEVENTH OF NINE CHILDREN
7294-92934-0004 WAS BORN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN IN BAMBOROUGH AND WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL OF ELEVEN YEARS HER FATHER WAS GIVEN CHARGE OF THE NEW LIGHT ON LONGSTONE ROCK
7294-92934-0005 WHICH WAS ONE OF A SERIES OF DANGEROUS REEFS WHERE NO VESSEL EVER BUILT COULD LIVE WHEN A GALE WAS BLOWING THE HIGHEST PART OF LONGSTONE ROCK WAS ONLY FOUR FEET ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE SEA
7294-92934-0006 AND NEAR AT HAND WERE TWENTY THREE OTHER REEFS OR ISLANDS BETWEEN WHICH THE OCEAN TIDES RAN IN CURIOUS CURRENTS AND EDDYS AND WHERE THE GREAT ROLLERS CAME RACING IN WITH A TREMENDOUS ROARING
7294-92934-0007 TO BURST UPON THE BASE OF THE LIGHTHOUSE AND THROW THE SPRAY HIGH ABOVE THE LIGHT ITSELF IT WAS A WILD SPOT EVEN IN CALM WEATHER BUT WHEN A STORM BLEW IT BECAME TERRIBLE
7294-92934-0008 THEN ALL COMMUNICATION WITH THE MAINLAND WAS CUT OFF AND FOR DAYS AT A TIME
7294-92934-0009 THE ONLY NEWS THAT THE OUTSIDE WORLD HAD FROM THE LONELY LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER WAS THE YELLOW BEAM OF THE LANTERN THAT SHONE FROM THE TOP OF THE TOWER ACROSS THE DESOLATE EXPANSE OF UGLY ROCKS AND ROARING WATERS
7294-92934-0010 HER FATHER WAS AN INTELLIGENT AND KIND HEARTED MAN WHO GAVE AN EYE TO HER EDUCATION HIMSELF AND TAUGHT HER HOW TO READ AND WRITE HE WAS ALSO CONSIDERED THE BEST BOATMAN ON THE WHOLE NORTHUMBERLAND COAST
7294-92934-0011 THE BRAVEST AND MOST SKILFUL AND IT WAS PARTLY DUE TO HIS REPUTATION IN THESE RESPECTS THAT HE WAS MADE THE KEEPER OF THE NEW LIGHT ON THE LONGSTONE WITH A LARGE INCREASE IN PAY
7294-92934-0012 AND A COMFORTABLE HOME FOR HIS FAMILY FOR THE INTERIOR OF THE LIGHTHOUSE HELD SEVERAL LARGE AND PLEASANT ROOMS WHERE THE DARLINGS LIVED ALL OF HIS ELDER CHILDREN HAD GONE OFF TO MAKE THEIR LIVING
7294-92934-0013 AND WILLIAM DARLING LIVED WITH HIS WIFE AND HIS DAUGHTER GRACE WHO SPENT HER TIME IN READING HELPING HER MOTHER WITH THE HOUSEWORK AND WHEN IT WAS CALM WANDERING OVER THE ROCKS OBSERVING THE GULLS
7294-92934-0014 THE SEA WEEDS AND THE STRANGE SEA CREATURES THAT THE OCEAN BROUGHT TO THE SURFACE OR THAT CRAWLED AND SWAM AMONG THE MORE SHELTERED ROCK POOLS BUT THE CONFINEMENT OF THE LIFE IN THE LIGHTHOUSE
7294-92934-0015 WAS NOT GOOD FOR THE GROWING GIRL AND GRACE NEVER WAS STRONG AND ROBUST AS WOULD BE EXPECTED FROM THE DAUGHTER OF FISHERMEN NOR WAS SHE HANDSOME BUT SHE POSSESSED A KINDLY AND WINNING NATURE AND
7294-92934-0016 AS WILL BE SEEN THE ABILITY TO RISE TO HEIGHTS OF GREATNESS WHEN NECESSITY CALLED ON HER TO DO SO WHEN GRACE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN OF TWENTY THREE A TERRIBLE STORM BURST SUDDENLY UPON THE COAST
7294-92934-0017 AND IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THE REEFS ABOUT THE LIGHTHOUSE WERE A SEA OF CHURNING FOAM WHILE THE GREAT WAVES RACING IN FROM THE OCEAN THUNDERED SO MIGHTILY AT ITS BASE
7294-92934-0018 THAT IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THEY MUST TEAR IT FROM ITS FOUNDATIONS AND SWEEP IT AWAY A SHORT TIME BEFORE THIS GALE BROKE THE STEAMER FORFARSHIRE HAD SAILED FROM HULL FOR DUNDEE IN SCOTLAND
7294-92934-0019 ALL TOLD ABOUT SIXTY THREE PERSONS INCLUDING THE PASSENGERS AND CREW SHE WAS A FINE NEW STEAMER WELL AND STRONGLY BUILT BUT SHE HAD PUT TO SEA WITH HER BOILERS IN POOR CONDITION
7294-92934-0020 AND IT HAD BEEN INTENDED TO GIVE THEM A THOROUGH OVERHAULING IN DUNDEE WHEN THE STEAMER WAS OFF FLAMBOROUGH HEAD THE BOILERS COMMENCED TO LEAK
7294-92934-0021 AND THE SHIP'S FIRES WERE EXTINGUISHED THEY WERE REKINDLED AND THE LEAK REPAIRED BUT JUST AS THE FORFARSHIRE WAS OFF THE FARNE ISLANDS THE GALE BROKE WITH GREAT FURY
7294-92934-0022 WHILE PITCHING IN THE HEAVY SEAS THE BOILERS LEAKED TERRIBLY THE FIRES WERE AGAIN PUT OUT AND THE SHIP BECAME UNMANAGEABLE SAILS WERE HOISTED BUT WERE TORN TO RIBBONS BY THE WIND
7294-92934-0023 WITH NO PROPELLING POWER THE FORFARSHIRE ROLLED HELPLESS IN THE TROUGH OF THE SEA AND WAS SWIFTLY BORNE TOWARD THE ROCKS FOG AND RAIN MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SAILORS TO SEE UNTIL THEY WERE IN THE TEETH OF THE BREAKERS
7294-92934-0024 AND THEN THE BEAM OF THE LIGHTHOUSE SHOWED THEM THE WILD ROCKS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY NOTHING COULD SAVE THEM FROM DESTRUCTION WITH A CRASH THE STEAMER DROVE ON THE HARCARS ROCKS
7294-92934-0025 AND REMAINED THERE THE SEAS BREAKING COMPLETELY OVER IT SOME OF THE CREW LAUNCHED A BOAT AND ESCAPED DESERTING THEIR CAPTAIN
7294-92934-0026 THE REST CLUNG TO WHAT SUPPORTS THEY COULD FIND AND HELD ON EXPECTING INSTANT DEATH A WAVE LARGER THAN THE REST PICKED UP THE FORFARSHIRE BODILY AND DROVE IT DOWN AGAIN UPON THE ROCKS
7294-92934-0027 BREAKING IT IN TWO THE AFTER HALF OF THE VESSEL WAS SWEPT AWAY BY THE SEAS WITH MANY PASSENGERS AND THE CAPTAIN AND HIS WIFE ALL WERE LOST ON THE FORWARD PART OF THE SHIP
7294-92934-0028 THE WRECK COULD BE SEEN FROM THE MAINLAND BUT THE MISERY OF THE UNFORTUNATE PERSONS WHO SURVIVED WAS EVEN MORE PLAIN TO WILLIAM DARLING AND HIS FAMILY GRACE BEGGED HER FATHER TO LAUNCH A BOAT AND GO TO THEIR ASSISTANCE
7294-92934-0029 BUT DARLING BRAVE SAILOR AS HE WAS KNEW THAT THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO CHANCE OF HIS EVER REACHING THE DOOMED SHIP AND SHOOK HIS HEAD THEN GRACE BEGAN TO PLEAD WITH HER FATHER
7294-92934-0030 TELLING HIM IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO LOSE HIS LIFE THAN TO PASS BY PEOPLE IN SUCH DISTRESS AND THAT SHE HERSELF WOULD GO WITH HIM AND BEAR A HAND AT THE OARS DARLING WAS NO COWARD
7294-92934-0031 AND THE PRAYERS AND ENTREATIES OF HIS DAUGHTER WON THE DAY HE DECIDED TO RISK LAUNCHING A BOAT FROM THE LIGHTHOUSE WITH MISSUS DARLING TO HELP THEM IN LAUNCHING THEIR BOAT
7294-92934-0032 GRACE AND HER FATHER PUT FORTH FROM THE LIGHTHOUSE RUNNING THEIR BOAT INTO THE SEA IN THE LEE OF THE ROCKS AND PULLING STRONGLY FOR THE WRECK FATHER AND DAUGHTER BOTH LABORED AT THE OARS
7294-92934-0033 UNABLE TO SPEAK ON ACCOUNT OF THE ROAR OF THE SEA AND WIND AND BLINDED BY THE SPRAY THAT WHIRLED OVER THEM THEIR BOAT WAS TOSSED LIKE A SHUTTLECOCK IN THE GREAT WAVES AND THEY KNEW THAT UNLESS THE SHIPWRECKED PERSONS COULD AID THEM
7294-92934-0034 IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO RETURN TO THE LIGHTHOUSE THEY MUST SUCCEED OR DIE AND THEIR CHANCE OF SUCCESS WAS SMALL LITTLE BY LITTLE THEY DREW NEAR THE WRECK BY THIS TIME
7294-92934-0035 THE TIDE HAD EBBED SUFFICIENTLY FOR THE SURVIVORS TO LEAVE THE SHIP AND STAND ON THE SLIPPERY ROCKS BUT ALREADY SOME OF THEM HAD SUCCUMBED AND THE REST WOULD CERTAINLY BE WASHED AWAY AND DROWNED
7294-92934-0036 AS THE RESCUERS DREW NEAR THE REEF DARLING LEAPED ASHORE AND GRACE KEPT THE FRAIL ROWBOAT FROM DASHING ITSELF TO PIECES AGAINST THE ROCKS
7294-92934-0037 THEN FOLLOWED THE DIFFICULT TASK OF GETTING THE SURVIVORS INTO THE BOAT ONE AFTER ONE WADED OUT AS FAR AS HE DARED AND WAS PULLED OVER THE GUNWALE WHEN THE LAST PERSON WAS ABOARD DARLING CLAMBERED BACK
7294-92934-0038 AND WITH NEW HANDS AT THE OARS THE BOAT WAS ROWED BACK TO THE LIGHTHOUSE A TRIP THAT REQUIRED GREAT STRENGTH AND MUCH TIME FOR THE CURRENT WAS AGAINST THEM AND WHEN THE LIGHT WAS REACHED
7294-92934-0039 THE SHIPWRECKED PEOPLE WERE SOON MADE COMFORTABLE AND CARED FOR BY GRACE AND MISSUS DARLING AND NINE LIVES WERE THUS SAVED BY THE DETERMINATION OF A SINGLE GIRL
7294-92934-0040 A BOAT FULL OF FISHERMEN PUT OUT FROM THE SHORE AT A PLACE CALLED NORTH SUNDERLAND AND AFTER NEARLY BEING SWAMPED IN THE HIGH SEAS SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING NEAR THE WRECK
7294-92934-0041 AND NOT DARING TO RETURN TO THE MAINLAND IN THE SEA THEN RUNNING SUCCEEDED IN REACHING THE LIGHTHOUSE AMONG THEM WAS GRACE'S BROTHER BROOKS DARLING AND THE HEROISM OF HIS ACHIEVEMENT AND THAT OF THE OTHER FISHERMEN
7294-92934-0042 ALL ENGLAND RANG WITH THE FAME OF GRACE'S EXPLOIT AND LETTERS AND GIFTS POURED IN FROM EVERY SIDE SCORES OF PEOPLE VISITED THE LIGHTHOUSE GRACE WAS FETED AND ADMIRED
7294-92934-0043 AND A PUBLIC SUBSCRIPTION IN HER BENEFIT RESULTED IN A GIFT OF SEVEN HUNDRED POUNDS OR ABOUT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OF OUR MONEY SHE ALSO RECEIVED FOUR MEDALS
7294-92934-0044 AND A LARGE SUM OF MONEY IN PRIVATE GIFTS GRACE AND HER FAMILY TOOK THEIR NEW PROMINENCE WITH GREAT GOOD SENSE AND MODESTY AND DISLIKED THE PUBLICITY WHICH CAME TO THEM
7294-92934-0045 THEY WERE ASTONISHED AT THE COMMOTION THEIR EXPLOIT HAD CAUSED FOR TO THEM IT APPEARED LITTLE MORE THAN A PART OF THE DAY'S WORK THAT DUTY REQUIRED THEM TO PERFORM BUT GRACE DID NOT LIVE LONG AFTER HER EXPLOIT
7294-92934-0046 HER CONFINED LIFE AT THE LIGHTHOUSE AND THE EXPOSURE SHE UNDERWENT THERE RESULTED IN THE DISEASE OF CONSUMPTION FROM WHICH SHE RAPIDLY WASTED AWAY IN SPITE OF THE BEST MEDICAL AID SHE STEADILY DROOPED
7294-92934-0047 AND TWO YEARS AFTER SHE HAD DONE HER BRAVE DEED SHE DIED IN THE TOWN OF BAMBOROUGH WHERE SHE HAD BEEN BORN AGAIN A SUBSCRIPTION WAS COLLECTED AND A MONUMENT WAS ERECTED IN HER HONOR
7294-92934-0048 HER FATHER AND MOTHER LIVED TO A RIPE OLD AGE REAPING BENEFITS FROM THE MONEY THAT GRACE HAD LEFT THEM PERHAPS SOME OF THEIR DESCENDANTS ARE STILL TENDING THE LIGHT AT THE PRESENT DAY BUT AT ALL EVENTS
