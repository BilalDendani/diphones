7809-108638-0000 A TALE OF THE RAGGED MOUNTAINS DURING THE FALL OF THE YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN WHILE RESIDING NEAR CHARLOTTESVILLE VIRGINIA I CASUALLY MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MISTER AUGUSTUS BEDLOE
7809-108638-0001 THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN WAS REMARKABLE IN EVERY RESPECT AND EXCITED IN ME A PROFOUND INTEREST AND CURIOSITY I FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPREHEND HIM EITHER IN HIS MORAL OR HIS PHYSICAL RELATIONS OF HIS FAMILY I COULD OBTAIN NO SATISFACTORY ACCOUNT
7809-108638-0002 WHENCE HE CAME I NEVER ASCERTAINED EVEN ABOUT HIS AGE ALTHOUGH I CALL HIM A YOUNG GENTLEMAN THERE WAS SOMETHING WHICH PERPLEXED ME IN NO LITTLE DEGREE HE CERTAINLY SEEMED YOUNG AND HE MADE A POINT OF SPEAKING ABOUT HIS YOUTH
7809-108638-0003 YET THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN I SHOULD HAVE HAD LITTLE TROUBLE IN IMAGINING HIM A HUNDRED YEARS OF AGE BUT IN NO REGARD WAS HE MORE PECULIAR THAN IN HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE HE WAS SINGULARLY TALL AND THIN
7809-108638-0004 HE STOOPED MUCH HIS LIMBS WERE EXCEEDINGLY LONG AND EMACIATED HIS FOREHEAD WAS BROAD AND LOW HIS COMPLEXION WAS ABSOLUTELY BLOODLESS
7809-108638-0005 ALTHOUGH SOUND THAN I HAD EVER BEFORE SEEN TEETH IN A HUMAN HEAD THE EXPRESSION OF HIS SMILE HOWEVER WAS BY NO MEANS UNPLEASING AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED BUT IT HAD NO VARIATION WHATEVER
7809-108638-0006 OR DIMINUTION OF LIGHT UNDERWENT CONTRACTION
7809-108638-0007 IN MOMENTS OF EXCITEMENT THE ORBS GREW BRIGHT TO A DEGREE ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE SEEMING TO EMIT LUMINOUS RAYS
7809-108638-0008 BUT OF AN INTRINSIC LUSTRE AS DOES A CANDLE OR THE SUN YET THEIR ORDINARY CONDITION WAS SO TOTALLY VAPID FILMY
7809-108638-0009 AND DULL AS TO CONVEY THE IDEA OF THE EYES OF A LONG INTERRED CORPSE THESE PECULIARITIES OF PERSON APPEARED TO CAUSE HIM MUCH ANNOYANCE
7809-108638-0010 AND HE WAS CONTINUALLY ALLUDING TO THEM IN A SORT OF HALF EXPLANATORY HALF APOLOGETIC STRAIN WHICH WHEN I FIRST HEARD IT IMPRESSED ME VERY PAINFULLY I SOON HOWEVER GREW ACCUSTOMED TO IT AND MY UNEASINESS WORE OFF
7809-108638-0011 IT SEEMED TO BE HIS DESIGN RATHER TO INSINUATE THAN DIRECTLY TO ASSERT THAT PHYSICALLY HE HAD NOT ALWAYS BEEN WHAT HE WAS THAT A LONG SERIES OF NEURALGIC ATTACKS HAD REDUCED HIM FROM A CONDITION
7809-108638-0012 OF MORE THAN USUAL PERSONAL BEAUTY TO THAT WHICH I SAW FOR MANY YEARS PAST HE HAD BEEN ATTENDED BY A PHYSICIAN NAMED TEMPLETON AN OLD GENTLEMAN PERHAPS SEVENTY YEARS OF AGE
7809-108638-0013 WHOM HE HAD FIRST ENCOUNTERED AT SARATOGA AND FROM WHOSE ATTENTION WHILE THERE HE EITHER RECEIVED OR FANCIED THAT HE RECEIVED GREAT BENEFIT THE RESULT WAS THAT BEDLOE WHO WAS WEALTHY
7809-108638-0014 HAD MADE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH DOCTOR TEMPLETON BY WHICH THE LATTER IN CONSIDERATION OF A LIBERAL ANNUAL ALLOWANCE HAD CONSENTED TO DEVOTE HIS TIME AND MEDICAL EXPERIENCE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE CARE OF THE INVALID
7809-108638-0015 DOCTOR TEMPLETON HAD BEEN A TRAVELLER IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS AND AT PARIS HAD BECOME A CONVERT IN GREAT MEASURE TO THE DOCTRINES OF MESMER IT WAS ALTOGETHER BY MEANS OF MAGNETIC REMEDIES
7809-108638-0016 AND THIS SUCCESS HAD VERY NATURALLY INSPIRED THE LATTER WITH A CERTAIN DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE IN THE OPINIONS FROM WHICH THE REMEDIES HAD BEEN EDUCED THE DOCTOR HOWEVER LIKE ALL ENTHUSIASTS HAD STRUGGLED HARD TO MAKE A THOROUGH CONVERT OF HIS PUPIL
7809-108638-0017 LATE DAYS HAS BECOME SO COMMON AS TO ATTRACT LITTLE OR NO ATTENTION BUT WHICH AT THE PERIOD OF WHICH I WRITE HAD VERY RARELY BEEN KNOWN IN AMERICA I MEAN TO SAY THAT BETWEEN DOCTOR TEMPLETON AND BEDLOE
7809-108638-0018 THERE HAD GROWN UP LITTLE BY LITTLE A VERY DISTINCT AND STRONGLY MARKED RAPPORT OR MAGNETIC RELATION I AM NOT PREPARED TO ASSERT HOWEVER THAT THIS RAPPORT EXTENDED BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE SIMPLE SLEEP PRODUCING POWER
7809-108638-0019 BUT THIS POWER ITSELF HAD ATTAINED GREAT INTENSITY AT THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO INDUCE THE MAGNETIC SOMNOLENCY THE MESMERIST ENTIRELY FAILED IN THE FIFTH OR SIXTH HE SUCCEEDED VERY PARTIALLY
7809-108638-0020 SLEEP WAS BROUGHT ABOUT ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY BY THE MERE VOLITION OF THE OPERATOR EVEN WHEN THE INVALID WAS UNAWARE OF HIS PRESENCE IT IS ONLY NOW IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE
7809-108638-0021 ENTHUSIASTIC HIS IMAGINATION WAS SINGULARLY VIGOROUS AND CREATIVE AND NO DOUBT IT DERIVED ADDITIONAL FORCE FROM THE HABITUAL USE OF MORPHINE WHICH HE SWALLOWED IN GREAT QUANTITY
7809-108638-0022 IT WAS HIS PRACTICE TO TAKE A VERY LARGE DOSE OF IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER BREAKFAST EACH MORNING OR RATHER IMMEDIATELY AFTER A CUP OF STRONG COFFEE
7809-108638-0023 AND THEN SET FORTH ALONE OR ATTENDED ONLY BY A DOG UPON A LONG RAMBLE AMONG THE CHAIN OF WILD AND DREARY HILLS THAT LIE WESTWARD AND SOUTHWARD OF CHARLOTTESVILLE AND ARE THERE DIGNIFIED BY THE TITLE OF THE RAGGED MOUNTAINS
7809-108638-0024 UPON A DIM WARM MISTY DAY TOWARD THE CLOSE OF NOVEMBER AND DURING THE STRANGE INTERREGNUM OF THE SEASONS WHICH IN AMERICA IS TERMED THE INDIAN SUMMER MISTER BEDLOE DEPARTED AS USUAL FOR THE HILLS
7809-108638-0025 IN HEALTH NO WORSE THAN USUAL AND IN RATHER MORE THAN ORDINARY SPIRITS THE ACCOUNT WHICH HE GAVE OF HIS EXPEDITION AND OF THE EVENTS WHICH HAD DETAINED HIM WAS A SINGULAR ONE INDEED YOU WILL REMEMBER SAID HE
7809-108638-0026 I BENT MY STEPS IMMEDIATELY TO THE MOUNTAINS AND ABOUT TEN ENTERED A GORGE WHICH WAS ENTIRELY NEW TO ME
7809-108638-0027 THE SCENERY WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF ON ALL SIDES ALTHOUGH SCARCELY ENTITLED TO BE CALLED GRAND HAD ABOUT IT AN INDESCRIBABLE AND TO ME A DELICIOUS ASPECT OF DREARY DESOLATION
7809-108638-0028 THE SOLITUDE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY VIRGIN
7809-108638-0029 HAD BEEN TRODDEN NEVER BEFORE BY THE FOOT OF A HUMAN BEING SO ENTIRELY SECLUDED AND IN FACT INACCESSIBLE EXCEPT THROUGH A SERIES OF ACCIDENTS IS THE ENTRANCE OF THE RAVINE
7809-108638-0030 THAT IT IS BY NO MEANS IMPOSSIBLE THAT I WAS INDEED THE FIRST ADVENTURER THE VERY FIRST AND SOLE ADVENTURER
7809-108638-0031 TO DEEPEN THE VAGUE IMPRESSIONS WHICH THESE OBJECTS CREATED
7809-108638-0032 THIS PATH WAS EXCESSIVELY SINUOUS AND AS THE SUN COULD NOT BE SEEN I SOON LOST ALL IDEA OF THE DIRECTION IN WHICH I JOURNEYED IN THE MEANTIME THE MORPHINE HAD ITS CUSTOMARY EFFECT
7809-108638-0033 THAT OF ENDUING ALL THE EXTERNAL WORLD WITH AN INTENSITY OF INTEREST IN THE QUIVERING OF A LEAF IN THE HUE OF A BLADE OF GRASS IN THE SHAPE OF A TREFOIL IN THE HUMMING OF A BEE
7809-108638-0034 IN THE GLEAMING OF A DEW DROP IN THE BREATHING OF THE WIND IN THE FAINT ODORS THAT CAME FROM THE FOREST THERE CAME A WHOLE UNIVERSE OF SUGGESTION A GAY AND MOTLEY TRAIN OF RHAPSODICAL AND
7809-108638-0035 IMMETHODICAL THOUGHT BUSIED IN THIS I WALKED ON FOR SEVERAL HOURS DURING WHICH THE MIST DEEPENED AROUND ME TO SO GREAT AN EXTENT THAT AT LENGTH I WAS REDUCED TO AN ABSOLUTE GROPING OF THE WAY
7809-108638-0036 AND NOW AN INDESCRIBABLE UNEASINESS POSSESSED ME A SPECIES OF NERVOUS HESITATION AND TREMOR I FEARED TO TREAD LEST I SHOULD BE PRECIPITATED INTO SOME ABYSS I REMEMBERED TOO STRANGE STORIES
7809-108638-0037 TOLD ABOUT THESE RAGGED HILLS AND OF THE UNCOUTH AND FIERCE RACES OF MEN WHO TENANTED THEIR GROVES AND CAVERNS
7809-108638-0038 VERY SUDDENLY MY ATTENTION WAS ARRESTED BY THE LOUD BEATING OF A DRUM MY AMAZEMENT WAS OF COURSE EXTREME
7809-108638-0039 BUT A NEW AND STILL MORE ASTOUNDING SOURCE OF INTEREST AND PERPLEXITY AROSE THERE CAME A WILD RATTLING OR JINGLING SOUND
7809-108638-0040 RUSHED PAST ME WITH A SHRIEK HE CAME SO CLOSE TO MY PERSON THAT I FELT HIS HOT BREATH UPON MY FACE
7809-108638-0041 SCARCELY HAD HE DISAPPEARED IN THE MIST BEFORE
7809-108638-0042 THE SIGHT OF THIS MONSTER RATHER RELIEVED THAN HEIGHTENED MY TERRORS FOR I NOW MADE SURE THAT I DREAMED
7809-108638-0043 I STEPPED BOLDLY AND BRISKLY FORWARD I RUBBED MY EYES I CALLED ALOUD I PINCHED MY LIMBS
7809-108638-0044 HERE STOOPING I BATHED MY HANDS AND MY HEAD AND NECK THIS SEEMED TO DISSIPATE THE EQUIVOCAL SENSATIONS WHICH HAD HITHERTO ANNOYED ME
7809-108638-0045 AS I THOUGHT A NEW MAN AND PROCEEDED STEADILY AND COMPLACENTLY ON MY UNKNOWN WAY AT LENGTH QUITE OVERCOME BY EXERTION AND BY A CERTAIN OPPRESSIVE CLOSENESS OF THE ATMOSPHERE
7809-108638-0046 I SEATED MYSELF BENEATH A TREE PRESENTLY THERE CAME A FEEBLE GLEAM OF SUNSHINE AND THE SHADOW OF THE LEAVES OF THE TREE FELL FAINTLY BUT DEFINITELY UPON THE GRASS
7809-108638-0047 AT THIS SHADOW I GAZED WONDERINGLY FOR MANY MINUTES ITS CHARACTER STUPEFIED ME WITH ASTONISHMENT I LOOKED UPWARD THE TREE WAS A PALM I NOW AROSE HURRIEDLY AND IN A STATE OF FEARFUL AGITATION
7809-108638-0048 FOR THE FANCY THAT I DREAMED WOULD SERVE ME NO LONGER I SAW I FELT
7809-108638-0049 AND THESE SENSES NOW BROUGHT TO MY SOUL A WORLD OF NOVEL AND SINGULAR SENSATION THE HEAT BECAME ALL AT ONCE INTOLERABLE A STRANGE ODOR LOADED THE BREEZE A LOW CONTINUOUS MURMUR
7809-108638-0050 LIKE THAT ARISING FROM A FULL BUT GENTLY FLOWING RIVER CAME TO MY EARS INTERMINGLED WITH THE PECULIAR HUM OF MULTITUDINOUS HUMAN VOICES WHILE I LISTENED IN AN EXTREMITY OF ASTONISHMENT
7809-108638-0051 WHICH I NEED NOT ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE A STRONG AND BRIEF GUST OF WIND
7809-108638-0052 I FOUND MYSELF AT THE FOOT OF A HIGH MOUNTAIN AND LOOKING DOWN INTO A VAST PLAIN THROUGH WHICH WOUND A MAJESTIC RIVER ON THE MARGIN OF THIS RIVER STOOD AN EASTERN LOOKING CITY
7809-108638-0053 SUCH AS WE READ OF IN THE ARABIAN TALES BUT OF A CHARACTER EVEN MORE SINGULAR THAN ANY THERE DESCRIBED FROM MY POSITION WHICH WAS FAR ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE TOWN
7809-108638-0054 I COULD PERCEIVE ITS EVERY NOOK AND CORNER AS IF DELINEATED ON A MAP THE STREETS SEEMED INNUMERABLE AND CROSSED EACH OTHER IRREGULARLY IN ALL DIRECTIONS BUT WERE RATHER LONG WINDING ALLEYS THAN STREETS
7809-108638-0055 AND ABSOLUTELY SWARMED WITH INHABITANTS THE HOUSES WERE WILDLY PICTURESQUE ON EVERY HAND WAS A WILDERNESS OF BALCONIES OF VERANDAS OF MINARETS OF SHRINES AND FANTASTICALLY CARVED ORIELS
7809-108638-0056 BAZAARS ABOUNDED AND IN THESE WERE DISPLAYED RICH WARES IN INFINITE VARIETY AND PROFUSION SILKS MUSLINS THE MOST DAZZLING CUTLERY THE MOST MAGNIFICENT JEWELS AND GEMS
7809-108638-0057 LITTERS WITH STATELY DAMES CLOSE VEILED ELEPHANTS GORGEOUSLY CAPARISONED IDOLS GROTESQUELY HEWN DRUMS BANNERS AND GONGS SPEARS SILVER AND GILDED MACES AND AMID THE CROWD AND THE CLAMOR
7809-108638-0058 AMID THE MILLION OF BLACK AND YELLOW MEN TURBANED AND ROBED AND OF FLOWING BEARD THERE ROAMED A COUNTLESS MULTITUDE OF HOLY FILLETED BULLS
7809-108638-0059 OR CLUNG TO THE MINARETS AND ORIELS FROM THE SWARMING STREETS TO THE BANKS OF THE RIVER THERE DESCENDED INNUMERABLE FLIGHTS OF STEPS LEADING TO BATHING PLACES
7809-108638-0060 WHILE THE RIVER ITSELF SEEMED TO FORCE A PASSAGE WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE VAST FLEETS OF DEEPLY BURTHENED SHIPS THAT FAR AND WIDE ENCOUNTERED ITS SURFACE BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE CITY AROSE IN FREQUENT MAJESTIC GROUPS
7809-108638-0061 THE PALM AND THE COCOA
7809-108638-0062 OR A SOLITARY GRACEFUL MAIDEN TAKING HER WAY WITH A PITCHER UPON HER HEAD TO THE BANKS OF THE MAGNIFICENT RIVER
7809-108638-0063 BUT NOT SO WHAT I SAW WHAT I HEARD WHAT I FELT WHAT I THOUGHT HAD ABOUT IT NOTHING OF THE UNMISTAKABLE IDIOSYNCRASY OF THE DREAM
7809-108638-0064 ALL WAS RIGOROUSLY SELF CONSISTENT AT FIRST DOUBTING THAT I WAS REALLY AWAKE I ENTERED INTO A SERIES OF TESTS WHICH SOON CONVINCED ME THAT I REALLY WAS NOW
7809-108638-0065 WHEN ONE DREAMS AND IN THE DREAM SUSPECTS THAT HE DREAMS THE SUSPICION NEVER FAILS TO CONFIRM ITSELF AND THE SLEEPER IS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AROUSED THUS NOVALIS ERRS
7809-108638-0066 I AM FORCED TO CLASS IT AMONG OTHER PHENOMENA IN THIS I AM NOT SURE THAT YOU ARE WRONG OBSERVED DOCTOR TEMPLETON BUT PROCEED
7809-108638-0067 YOU AROSE AND DESCENDED INTO THE CITY I AROSE CONTINUED BEDLOE REGARDING THE DOCTOR WITH AN AIR OF PROFOUND ASTONISHMENT I AROSE AS YOU SAY AND
7809-108638-0068 DESCENDED INTO THE CITY ON MY WAY I FELL IN WITH AN IMMENSE POPULACE CROWDING THROUGH EVERY AVENUE ALL IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND EXHIBITING IN EVERY ACTION THE WILDEST EXCITEMENT
7809-108638-0069 VERY SUDDENLY AND BY SOME INCONCEIVABLE IMPULSE I BECAME INTENSELY IMBUED WITH PERSONAL INTEREST IN WHAT WAS GOING ON I SEEMED TO FEEL THAT I HAD AN IMPORTANT PART TO PLAY
7809-108638-0070 WITHOUT EXACTLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT WAS AGAINST THE CROWD WHICH ENVIRONED ME HOWEVER I EXPERIENCED A DEEP SENTIMENT OF ANIMOSITY I SHRANK FROM AMID THEM AND SWIFTLY BY A CIRCUITOUS PATH
7809-108638-0071 REACHED AND ENTERED THE CITY HERE ALL WAS THE WILDEST TUMULT AND CONTENTION
7809-108638-0072 CLAD IN GARMENTS HALF INDIAN HALF EUROPEAN AND OFFICERED BY GENTLEMEN IN A UNIFORM PARTLY BRITISH WERE ENGAGED AT GREAT ODDS WITH THE SWARMING RABBLE OF THE ALLEYS
7809-108638-0073 I JOINED THE WEAKER PARTY ARMING MYSELF WITH THE WEAPONS OF A FALLEN OFFICER AND FIGHTING I KNEW NOT WHOM WITH THE NERVOUS FEROCITY OF DESPAIR
7809-108638-0074 WE WERE SOON OVERPOWERED BY NUMBERS AND DRIVEN TO SEEK REFUGE IN A SPECIES OF KIOSK HERE WE BARRICADED OURSELVES AND FOR THE PRESENT WERE SECURE FROM A LOOP HOLE NEAR THE SUMMIT OF THE KIOSK
7809-108638-0075 I PERCEIVED A VAST CROWD IN FURIOUS AGITATION SURROUNDING AND ASSAULTING A GAY PALACE THAT OVERHUNG THE RIVER PRESENTLY
7809-108638-0076 THERE DESCENDED AN EFFEMINATE LOOKING PERSON
7809-108638-0077 A BOAT WAS AT HAND IN WHICH HE ESCAPED TO THE OPPOSITE BANK OF THE RIVER
7809-108638-0078 MY COMPANIONS AND HAVING SUCCEEDED IN GAINING OVER A FEW OF THEM TO MY PURPOSE MADE A FRANTIC SALLY FROM THE KIOSK WE RUSHED AMID THE CROWD THAT SURROUNDED IT THEY RETREATED AT FIRST BEFORE US
7809-108638-0079 THEY RALLIED FOUGHT MADLY AND RETREATED AGAIN IN THE MEAN TIME WE WERE BORNE FAR FROM THE KIOSK AND BECAME BEWILDERED AND ENTANGLED AMONG THE NARROW STREETS OF TALL OVERHANGING HOUSES
7809-108638-0080 THE RABBLE PRESSED IMPETUOUSLY UPON US HARRASSING US WITH THEIR SPEARS AND OVERWHELMING US WITH FLIGHTS OF ARROWS THESE LATTER WERE VERY REMARKABLE AND RESEMBLED IN SOME RESPECTS THE WRITHING CREESE OF THE MALAY
7809-108638-0081 THEY WERE MADE TO IMITATE THE BODY OF A CREEPING SERPENT AND WERE LONG AND BLACK WITH A POISONED BARB ONE OF THEM STRUCK ME UPON THE RIGHT TEMPLE I REELED AND FELL
7809-108638-0082 AN INSTANTANEOUS AND DREADFUL SICKNESS SEIZED ME I STRUGGLED I GASPED I DIED YOU WILL HARDLY PERSIST NOW SAID I SMILING THAT THE WHOLE OF YOUR ADVENTURE WAS NOT A DREAM
7809-108638-0083 WHEN I SAID THESE WORDS I OF COURSE EXPECTED SOME LIVELY SALLY FROM BEDLOE IN REPLY BUT TO MY ASTONISHMENT HE HESITATED TREMBLED BECAME FEARFULLY PALLID AND REMAINED SILENT
7809-108638-0084 HE AT LENGTH SAID HOARSELY TO BEDLOE FOR MANY MINUTES CONTINUED THE LATTER MY SOLE SENTIMENT MY SOLE FEELING WAS THAT OF DARKNESS AND
7809-108638-0085 NONENTITY WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF DEATH AT LENGTH THERE SEEMED TO PASS A VIOLENT AND SUDDEN SHOCK THROUGH MY SOUL AS IF OF ELECTRICITY
7809-108638-0086 WITH IT CAME THE SENSE OF ELASTICITY AND OF LIGHT THIS LATTER I FELT NOT SAW IN AN INSTANT I SEEMED TO RISE FROM THE GROUND BUT I HAD NO BODILY NO VISIBLE
7809-108638-0087 AUDIBLE OR PALPABLE PRESENCE THE CROWD HAD DEPARTED THE TUMULT HAD CEASED THE CITY WAS IN COMPARATIVE REPOSE BENEATH ME LAY MY CORPSE
7809-108638-0088 WITH THE ARROW IN MY TEMPLE THE WHOLE HEAD GREATLY SWOLLEN AND DISFIGURED BUT ALL THESE THINGS I FELT NOT SAW I TOOK INTEREST IN NOTHING EVEN THE CORPSE SEEMED A MATTER IN WHICH I HAD NO CONCERN
7809-108638-0089 BUT APPEARED TO BE IMPELLED INTO MOTION AND FLITTED BUOYANTLY OUT OF THE CITY RETRACING THE CIRCUITOUS PATH BY WHICH I HAD ENTERED IT WHEN I HAD ATTAINED THAT POINT OF THE RAVINE IN THE MOUNTAINS
7809-108638-0090 AT WHICH I HAD ENCOUNTERED THE HYENA I AGAIN EXPERIENCED A SHOCK
7809-108638-0091 THE SENSE OF WEIGHT OF VOLITION OF SUBSTANCE RETURNED I BECAME MY ORIGINAL SELF AND BENT MY STEPS EAGERLY HOMEWARD BUT THE PAST HAD NOT LOST THE VIVIDNESS OF THE REAL
7809-108638-0092 AND NOT NOW EVEN FOR AN INSTANT CAN I COMPEL MY UNDERSTANDING TO REGARD IT AS A DREAM NOR WAS IT SAID TEMPLETON WITH AN AIR OF DEEP SOLEMNITY YET IT WOULD
7809-108638-0093 OTHERWISE IT SHOULD BE TERMED
7809-108638-0094 THE SOUL OF THE MAN OF TO DAY IS UPON THE VERGE OF SOME STUPENDOUS PSYCHAL DISCOVERIES LET US CONTENT OURSELVES WITH THIS SUPPOSITION
7809-108638-0095 FOR THE REST I HAVE SOME EXPLANATION TO MAKE HERE IS A WATERCOLOR DRAWING WHICH I SHOULD HAVE SHOWN YOU BEFORE BUT WHICH AN UNACCOUNTABLE SENTIMENT OF HORROR
7809-108638-0096 HAS HITHERTO PREVENTED ME FROM SHOWING WE LOOKED AT THE PICTURE WHICH HE PRESENTED I SAW NOTHING IN IT OF AN EXTRAORDINARY CHARACTER BUT ITS EFFECT UPON BEDLOE WAS PRODIGIOUS
7809-108638-0097 HE NEARLY FAINTED AS HE GAZED AND YET IT WAS BUT A MINIATURE PORTRAIT A MIRACULOUSLY ACCURATE ONE TO BE SURE OF HIS OWN VERY REMARKABLE FEATURES AT LEAST THIS WAS MY THOUGHT
7809-108638-0098 AS I REGARDED IT YOU WILL PERCEIVE SAID TEMPLETON THE DATE OF THIS PICTURE IT IS HERE SCARCELY VISIBLE IN THIS CORNER SEVENTEEN EIGHTY
7809-108638-0099 IN THIS YEAR WAS THE PORTRAIT TAKEN IT IS THE LIKENESS OF A DEAD FRIEND A MISTER OLDEB TO WHOM I BECAME MUCH ATTACHED AT CALCUTTA
7809-108638-0100 DURING THE ADMINISTRATION OF WARREN HASTINGS I WAS THEN ONLY TWENTY YEARS OLD WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU MISTER BEDLOE AT SARATOGA IT WAS THE MIRACULOUS SIMILARITY
7809-108638-0101 IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS POINT I WAS URGED PARTLY AND PERHAPS PRINCIPALLY BY A REGRETFUL MEMORY OF THE DECEASED
7809-108638-0102 AND NOT ALTOGETHER HORRORLESS CURIOSITY RESPECTING YOURSELF IN YOUR DETAIL OF THE VISION WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF TO YOU AMID THE HILLS YOU HAVE DESCRIBED
7809-108638-0103 THE INDIAN CITY OF BENARES UPON THE HOLY RIVER THE RIOTS THE COMBAT THE MASSACRE WERE THE ACTUAL EVENTS OF THE INSURRECTION OF CHEYTE SING
7809-108638-0104 WHICH TOOK PLACE IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY WHEN HASTINGS WAS PUT IN IMMINENT PERIL OF HIS LIFE THE MAN ESCAPING BY THE STRING OF TURBANS WAS CHEYTE SING HIMSELF
7809-108638-0105 THE PARTY IN THE KIOSK WERE SEPOYS AND BRITISH OFFICERS HEADED BY HASTINGS OF THIS PARTY I WAS ONE
7809-108638-0106 TO PREVENT THE RASH AND FATAL SALLY OF THE OFFICER WHO FELL IN THE CROWDED ALLEYS BY THE POISONED ARROW OF A BENGALEE THAT OFFICER WAS MY DEAREST FRIEND IT WAS OLDEB
7809-108638-0107 YOU WILL PERCEIVE BY THESE MANUSCRIPTS HERE THE SPEAKER PRODUCED A NOTE BOOK IN WHICH SEVERAL PAGES APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN FRESHLY WRITTEN THAT AT THE VERY PERIOD
7809-108638-0108 IN WHICH YOU FANCIED THESE THINGS AMID THE HILLS I WAS ENGAGED IN DETAILING THEM UPON PAPER HERE AT HOME IN ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THIS CONVERSATION THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS APPEARED
7809-108638-0109 IN A CHARLOTTESVILLE PAPER WE HAVE THE PAINFUL DUTY OF ANNOUNCING THE DEATH OF MISTER AUGUSTUS BEDLO A GENTLEMAN WHOSE AMIABLE MANNERS AND MANY VIRTUES HAVE LONG ENDEARED HIM
7809-108638-0110 TO THE CITIZENS OF CHARLOTTESVILLE MISTER B FOR SOME YEARS PAST HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO NEURALGIA WHICH HAS OFTEN THREATENED TO TERMINATE FATALLY BUT THIS CAN BE REGARDED ONLY AS THE MEDIATE CAUSE OF HIS DECEASE
7809-108638-0111 THE PROXIMATE CAUSE WAS ONE OF ESPECIAL SINGULARITY IN AN EXCURSION TO THE RAGGED MOUNTAINS A FEW DAYS SINCE A SLIGHT COLD AND FEVER WERE CONTRACTED
7809-108638-0112 ATTENDED WITH GREAT DETERMINATION OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD TO RELIEVE THIS DOCTOR TEMPLETON RESORTED TO TOPICAL BLEEDING LEECHES WERE APPLIED TO THE TEMPLES IN A FEARFULLY BRIEF PERIOD
7809-108638-0113 THE PATIENT DIED WHEN IT APPEARED THAT IN THE JAR CONTAINING THE LEECHES HAD BEEN INTRODUCED BY ACCIDENT ONE OF THE VENOMOUS VERMICULAR SANGSUES WHICH ARE NOW AND THEN FOUND IN THE NEIGHBORING PONDS
7809-108638-0114 THIS CREATURE FASTENED ITSELF UPON A SMALL ARTERY IN THE RIGHT TEMPLE ITS CLOSE RESEMBLANCE TO THE MEDICINAL LEECH CAUSED THE MISTAKE TO BE OVERLOOKED UNTIL TOO LATE N B
7809-108638-0115 THE POISONOUS SANGSUE OF CHARLOTTESVILLE MAY ALWAYS BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE MEDICINAL LEECH BY ITS BLACKNESS AND ESPECIALLY BY ITS WRITHING OR VERMICULAR MOTIONS WHICH VERY NEARLY RESEMBLE THOSE OF A SNAKE
7809-108638-0116 I WAS SPEAKING WITH THE EDITOR OF THE PAPER IN QUESTION UPON THE TOPIC OF THIS REMARKABLE ACCIDENT WHEN IT OCCURRED TO ME TO ASK HOW IT HAPPENED THAT THE NAME OF THE DECEASED HAD BEEN GIVEN AS BEDLO
7809-108638-0117 I PRESUME I SAID YOU HAVE AUTHORITY FOR THIS SPELLING BUT I HAVE ALWAYS SUPPOSED THE NAME TO BE WRITTEN WITH AN E AT THE END AUTHORITY NO HE REPLIED
7809-108638-0118 THE NAME IS BEDLO WITH AN E ALL THE WORLD OVER AND I NEVER KNEW IT TO BE SPELT OTHERWISE IN MY LIFE THEN SAID I MUTTERINGLY AS I TURNED UPON MY HEEL THEN INDEED
7809-108638-0119 HAS IT COME TO PASS THAT ONE TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN ANY FICTION FOR BEDLOE WITHOUT THE E
