2735-160603-0000 THE WARM WIND LIFTED UP HER SHINING HAIR AND SOFTLY KISSED HER CHEEK WHILE THE SUNBEAMS LOOKING MOST KINDLY IN HER FACE MADE LITTLE RAINBOWS IN HER TEARS AND LINGERED LOVINGLY ABOUT HER BUT ANNIE PAID NO HEED TO SUN OR WIND OR FLOWER
2735-160603-0001 AND AM COME TO HELP AND COMFORT YOU NOW TELL ME WHY YOU WEEP AND LET ME BE YOUR FRIEND REPLIED THE SPIRIT AS SHE SMILED MORE KINDLY STILL ON ANNIE'S WONDERING FACE
2735-160603-0002 DO YOU RIDE ON BUTTERFLIES SLEEP IN FLOWER CUPS AND LIVE AMONG THE CLOUDS YES ALL THESE THINGS I DO AND MANY STRANGER STILL THAT ALL YOUR FAIRY BOOKS CAN NEVER TELL BUT NOW DEAR ANNIE SAID THE FAIRY BENDING NEARER
2735-160603-0003 WHY ARE THESE GREAT DROPS SHINING ON THE FLOWERS
2735-160603-0004 WHILE THE TEARS BEGAN TO FALL AGAIN I AM NOT HAPPY FOR I AM NOT
2735-160603-0005 GOOD LITTLE FAIRY WILL YOU TEACH ME HOW GLADLY WILL I AID YOU ANNIE AND IF YOU TRULY WISH TO BE A HAPPY CHILD YOU FIRST MUST LEARN TO CONQUER MANY PASSIONS THAT YOU CHERISH NOW AND MAKE YOUR HEART A HOME FOR GENTLE FEELINGS AND HAPPY THOUGHTS
2735-160603-0006 BEND HITHER THAT I MAY PLACE IT IN YOUR BREAST NO HAND CAN TAKE IT HENCE TILL I UNSAY THE SPELL THAT HOLDS IT THERE
2735-160603-0007 THIS IS A FAIRY FLOWER SAID THE ELF INVISIBLE TO EVERY EYE SAVE YOURS
2735-160603-0008 WHEN YOUR HEART IS FILLED WITH LOVING THOUGHTS WHEN SOME KINDLY DEED HAS BEEN DONE SOME DUTY WELL PERFORMED THEN FROM THE FLOWER THERE WILL ARISE THE SWEETEST SOFTEST FRAGRANCE TO REWARD AND GLADDEN YOU
2735-160603-0009 BUT WHEN AN UNKIND WORD IS ON YOUR LIPS WHEN A SELFISH ANGRY FEELING RISES IN YOUR HEART OR AN UNKIND CRUEL DEED IS TO BE DONE
2735-160603-0010 LISTEN TO ITS WARNING LET THE WORD REMAIN UNSPOKEN THE DEED UNDONE
2735-160603-0011 O KIND AND GENEROUS FAIRY HOW CAN I EVER THANK YOU FOR THIS LOVELY GIFT CRIED ANNIE I WILL BE TRUE AND LISTEN TO MY LITTLE BELL WHENEVER IT MAY RING BUT SHALL I NEVER SEE YOU MORE AH
2735-160603-0012 I CANNOT STAY NOW LITTLE ANNIE SAID THE ELF BUT WHEN ANOTHER SPRING COMES ROUND I SHALL BE HERE AGAIN TO SEE HOW WELL THE FAIRY GIFT HAS DONE ITS WORK AND NOW FAREWELL DEAR CHILD BE FAITHFUL TO YOURSELF AND THE MAGIC FLOWER WILL NEVER FADE
2735-160603-0013 THEN THE GENTLE FAIRY FOLDED HER LITTLE ARMS AROUND ANNIE'S NECK LAID A SOFT KISS ON HER CHEEK
2735-160603-0014 FLOATING IN THE SKY AND LITTLE ANNIE SAT AMONG HER FLOWERS AND WATCHED WITH WONDERING JOY THE FAIRY BLOSSOM SHINING ON HER BREAST THE PLEASANT DAYS OF SPRING AND SUMMER PASSED AWAY AND IN LITTLE ANNIE'S GARDEN AUTUMN FLOWERS WERE BLOOMING EVERYWHERE
2735-160603-0015 WITH EACH DAY'S SUN AND DEW GROWING STILL MORE BEAUTIFUL AND BRIGHT BUT THE FAIRY FLOWER THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE LOVELIEST OF ALL HUNG PALE AND DROOPING ON LITTLE ANNIE'S BOSOM ITS FRAGRANCE SEEMED QUITE GONE AND THE CLEAR LOW MUSIC OF ITS WARNING CHIME RANG OFTEN IN HER EAR
2735-160603-0016 THEN AS THE FAIRY SAID SHE FOUND A SWEET REWARD IN THE STRANGE SOFT PERFUME OF THE MAGIC BLOSSOM AS IT SHONE UPON HER BREAST BUT SELFISH THOUGHTS WOULD COME TO TEMPT HER SHE WOULD YIELD AND UNKIND WORDS FELL FROM HER LIPS
2735-160603-0017 AND THEN THE FLOWER DROOPED PALE AND SCENTLESS THE FAIRY BELL RANG MOURNFULLY ANNIE WOULD FORGET HER BETTER RESOLUTIONS AND BE AGAIN A SELFISH WILFUL LITTLE CHILD AT LAST SHE TRIED NO LONGER BUT GREW ANGRY WITH THE FAITHFUL FLOWER
2735-160603-0018 BREAST BUT THE FAIRY SPELL STILL HELD IT FAST AND ALL HER ANGRY WORDS BUT MADE IT RING A LOUDER SADDER PEAL THEN SHE PAID NO HEED TO THE SILVERY MUSIC SOUNDING IN HER EAR AND EACH DAY GREW STILL MORE UNHAPPY DISCONTENTED AND UNKIND
2735-160603-0019 SO WHEN THE AUTUMN DAYS CAME ROUND SHE WAS NO BETTER FOR THE GENTLE FAIRY'S GIFT AND LONGED FOR SPRING THAT IT MIGHT BE RETURNED
2735-160603-0020 ONE SUNNY MORNING WHEN THE FRESH COOL WINDS WERE BLOWING AND NOT A CLOUD WAS IN THE SKY LITTLE ANNIE WALKED AMONG HER FLOWERS LOOKING CAREFULLY INTO EACH HOPING THUS TO FIND THE FAIRY WHO ALONE COULD TAKE THE MAGIC BLOSSOM FROM HER BREAST BUT SHE LIFTED UP THEIR DROOPING LEAVES PEEPED INTO THEIR DEWY CUPS IN VAIN
2735-160603-0021 I WILL GO OUT INTO THE FIELDS AND WOODS AND SEEK HER THERE
2735-160603-0022 NOR WEAR THIS WITHERED FLOWER LONGER SO OUT INTO THE FIELDS SHE WENT WHERE THE LONG GRASS RUSTLED AS SHE PASSED AND TIMID BIRDS LOOKED AT HER FROM THEIR NESTS
2735-160603-0023 LITTLE ANNIE LOOKED SEARCHED AND ASKED THEM ALL IF ANY ONE COULD TELL HER OF THE FAIRY WHOM SHE SOUGHT
2735-160603-0024 THE FLOWERS NODDED WISELY ON THEIR STEMS BUT DID NOT SPEAK WHILE BUTTERFLY AND BEE BUZZED AND FLUTTERED AWAY ONE FAR TOO BUSY THE OTHER TOO IDLE TO STAY AND TELL HER WHAT SHE ASKED THEN SHE WENT THROUGH BROAD FIELDS OF YELLOW GRAIN
2735-160603-0025 THAT WAVED AROUND HER LIKE A GOLDEN FOREST HERE CRICKETS CHIRPED GRASSHOPPERS LEAPED AND BUSY ANTS WORKED BUT THEY COULD NOT TELL HER WHAT SHE LONGED TO KNOW NOW WILL I GO AMONG THE HILLS SAID ANNIE SHE MAY BE THERE SO UP AND DOWN THE GREEN HILL SIDES
2735-160603-0026 WENT HER LITTLE FEET LONG SHE SEARCHED AND VAINLY SHE CALLED BUT STILL NO FAIRY CAME THEN BY THE RIVER SIDE SHE WENT AND ASKED THE GAY DRAGON FLIES AND THE COOL WHITE LILIES IF THE FAIRY HAD BEEN THERE BUT THE BLUE WAVES RIPPLED ON THE WHITE SAND AT HER FEET
2735-160603-0027 AND NO VOICE ANSWERED HER THEN INTO THE FOREST LITTLE ANNIE WENT AND AS SHE PASSED ALONG THE DIM COOL PATHS
2735-160603-0028 SO WEARY WITH HER LONG AND USELESS SEARCH SHE SAT AMID THE FERNS AND FEASTED ON THE ROSY STRAWBERRIES THAT GREW BESIDE HER WATCHING MEANWHILE THE CRIMSON EVENING CLOUDS THAT GLOWED AROUND THE SETTING SUN THE NIGHT WIND RUSTLED THROUGH THE BOUGHS
2735-160603-0029 THE WILD BIRDS SANG THEIR EVENING HYMNS AND ALL WITHIN THE WOOD GREW CALM AND STILL PALER AND PALER GREW THE PURPLE LIGHT LOWER AND LOWER DROOPED LITTLE ANNIE'S HEAD THE TALL FERNS BENT TO SHIELD HER FROM THE DEW THE WHISPERING PINES SANG A SOFT LULLABY
2735-160603-0030 AND WHEN THE AUTUMN MOON ROSE UP HER SILVER LIGHT SHONE ON THE CHILD WHERE PILLOWED ON GREEN MOSS SHE LAY ASLEEP AMID THE WOOD FLOWERS IN THE DIM OLD FOREST AND ALL NIGHT LONG BESIDE HER STOOD THE FAIRY SHE HAD SOUGHT
2735-160603-0031 SENT TO THE SLEEPING CHILD THIS DREAM
2735-160603-0032 AND UNKIND WORDS UPON HER LIPS THE MAGIC FLOWER WAS RINGING ITS SOFT WARNING
2735-160603-0033 LITTLE ANNIE LOOK AND SEE THE EVIL THINGS THAT YOU ARE CHERISHING I WILL CLOTHE IN FITTING SHAPES THE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS THAT NOW DWELL WITHIN YOUR HEART AND YOU SHALL SEE HOW GREAT THEIR POWER BECOMES UNLESS YOU BANISH THEM FOR EVER THEN ANNIE SAW WITH FEAR AND WONDER
2735-160603-0034 THAT THE ANGRY WORDS SHE UTTERED CHANGED TO DARK UNLOVELY FORMS EACH SHOWING PLAINLY FROM WHAT FAULT OR PASSION IT HAD SPRUNG SOME OF THE SHAPES HAD SCOWLING FACES AND BRIGHT FIERY EYES
2735-160603-0035 OTHERS WITH SULLEN ANXIOUS LOOKS SEEMED GATHERING UP ALL THEY COULD REACH AND ANNIE SAW THAT THE MORE THEY GAINED THE LESS THEY SEEMED TO HAVE AND THESE SHE KNEW WERE SHAPES OF SELFISHNESS SPIRITS OF PRIDE WERE THERE
2735-160603-0036 WHO FOLDED THEIR SHADOWY GARMENTS ROUND THEM AND TURNED SCORNFULLY AWAY FROM ALL THE REST THESE AND MANY OTHERS LITTLE ANNIE SAW WHICH HAD COME FROM HER OWN HEART AND TAKEN FORM BEFORE HER EYES WHEN FIRST SHE SAW THEM THEY WERE SMALL AND WEAK
2735-160603-0037 BUT AS SHE LOOKED THEY SEEMED TO GROW AND GATHER STRENGTH AND EACH GAINED A STRANGE POWER OVER HER SHE COULD NOT DRIVE THEM FROM HER SIGHT AND THEY GREW EVER STRONGER DARKER AND MORE UNLOVELY TO HER EYES
2735-160603-0038 THEY SEEMED TO CAST BLACK SHADOWS OVER ALL AROUND TO DIM THE SUNSHINE BLIGHT THE FLOWERS AND DRIVE AWAY ALL BRIGHT AND LOVELY THINGS WHILE RISING SLOWLY ROUND HER ANNIE SAW A HIGH DARK WALL THAT SEEMED TO SHUT OUT EVERYTHING SHE LOVED
2735-160603-0039 SHE DARED NOT MOVE OR SPEAK BUT WITH A STRANGE FEAR AT HER HEART SAT WATCHING THE DIM SHAPES THAT HOVERED ROUND HER HIGHER AND HIGHER ROSE THE SHADOWY WALL SLOWLY THE FLOWERS NEAR HER DIED LINGERINGLY THE SUNLIGHT FADED
2735-160603-0040 BUT AT LAST THEY BOTH WERE GONE AND LEFT HER ALL ALONE BEHIND THE GLOOMY WALL THEN THE SPIRITS GATHERED ROUND HER WHISPERING STRANGE THINGS IN HER EAR BIDDING HER OBEY FOR BY HER OWN WILL SHE HAD YIELDED UP HER HEART TO BE THEIR HOME AND SHE WAS NOW THEIR SLAVE
2735-160603-0041 THEN SHE COULD HEAR NO MORE BUT SINKING DOWN AMONG THE WITHERED FLOWERS WEPT SAD AND BITTER TEARS FOR HER LOST LIBERTY AND JOY THEN THROUGH THE GLOOM THERE SHONE A FAINT SOFT LIGHT
2735-160603-0042 CLEARER AND BRIGHTER GREW THE
2735-160603-0043 AND LEFT THE CHILD ALONE THE LIGHT AND PERFUME OF THE FLOWER SEEMED TO BRING NEW STRENGTH TO ANNIE AND SHE ROSE UP SAYING AS SHE BENT TO KISS THE BLOSSOM ON HER BREAST DEAR FLOWER HELP AND GUIDE ME NOW AND I WILL LISTEN TO YOUR VOICE
2735-160603-0044 THEN IN HER DREAM SHE FELT HOW HARD THE SPIRITS TRIED TO TEMPT AND TROUBLE HER AND HOW BUT FOR HER FLOWER THEY WOULD HAVE LED HER BACK AND MADE ALL DARK AND DREARY AS BEFORE LONG AND HARD SHE STRUGGLED AND TEARS OFTEN FELL
2735-160603-0045 BUT AFTER EACH NEW TRIAL BRIGHTER SHONE HER MAGIC FLOWER AND SWEETER GREW ITS BREATH WHILE THE SPIRITS LOST STILL MORE THEIR POWER TO TEMPT HER MEANWHILE GREEN FLOWERING VINES CREPT UP THE HIGH DARK WALL AND HID ITS ROUGHNESS FROM HER SIGHT
2735-160603-0046 AND OVER THESE SHE WATCHED MOST TENDERLY FOR SOON WHEREVER GREEN LEAVES AND FLOWERS BLOOMED THE WALL BENEATH GREW WEAK AND FELL APART THUS LITTLE ANNIE WORKED AND HOPED TILL ONE BY ONE THE EVIL SPIRITS FLED AWAY
2735-160603-0047 AND IN THEIR PLACE CAME SHINING FORMS WITH GENTLE EYES AND SMILING LIPS WHO GATHERED ROUND HER WITH SUCH LOVING WORDS AND BROUGHT SUCH STRENGTH AND JOY TO ANNIE'S HEART THAT NOTHING EVIL DARED TO ENTER IN WHILE SLOWLY SANK THE GLOOMY WALL
2735-160603-0048 SHE PASSED OUT INTO THE PLEASANT WORLD AGAIN THE FAIRY GIFT NO LONGER PALE AND DROOPING BUT NOW SHINING LIKE A STAR UPON HER BREAST THEN THE LOW VOICE SPOKE AGAIN IN ANNIE'S SLEEPING EAR SAYING THE DARK UNLOVELY PASSIONS YOU HAVE LOOKED UPON ARE IN YOUR HEART
2735-160603-0049 LEST THEY SHOULD DARKEN YOUR WHOLE LIFE AND SHUT OUT LOVE AND HAPPINESS FOR EVER
2735-160603-0050 AND LET THE SHINING SPIRITS MAKE YOUR HEART THEIR HOME AND WITH THAT VOICE SOUNDING IN HER EAR LITTLE ANNIE WOKE TO FIND IT WAS A DREAM BUT LIKE OTHER DREAMS IT DID NOT PASS AWAY AND AS SHE SAT ALONE BATHED IN THE ROSY MORNING LIGHT AND WATCHED THE FOREST WAKEN INTO LIFE
2735-160603-0051 SHE THOUGHT OF THE STRANGE FORMS SHE HAD SEEN AND LOOKING DOWN UPON THE FLOWER ON HER BREAST SHE SILENTLY RESOLVED TO STRIVE AS SHE HAD STRIVEN IN HER DREAM TO BRING BACK LIGHT AND BEAUTY TO ITS FADED LEAVES
2735-160603-0052 AND AS THE THOUGHT CAME TO HER MIND THE FLOWER RAISED ITS DROOPING HEAD AND LOOKING UP INTO THE EARNEST LITTLE FACE BENT OVER IT SEEMED BY ITS FRAGRANT BREATH TO ANSWER ANNIE'S SILENT THOUGHT AND STRENGTHEN HER FOR WHAT MIGHT COME MEANWHILE THE FOREST WAS ASTIR
2735-160603-0053 BIRDS SANG THEIR GAY GOOD MORROWS FROM TREE TO TREE WHILE LEAF AND FLOWER TURNED TO GREET THE SUN WHO ROSE UP SMILING ON THE WORLD AND SO BENEATH THE FOREST BOUGHS
2735-160603-0054 AUTUMN FLOWERS WERE DEAD AND GONE YELLOW LEAVES LAY RUSTLING ON THE GROUND BLEAK WINDS WENT WHISTLING THROUGH THE NAKED TREES AND COLD WHITE WINTER SNOW FELL SOFTLY DOWN YET NOW WHEN ALL WITHOUT LOOKED DARK AND DREARY
2735-160603-0055 ON LITTLE ANNIE'S BREAST THE FAIRY FLOWER BLOOMED MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER THE MEMORY OF HER FOREST DREAM HAD NEVER PASSED AWAY AND THROUGH TRIAL AND TEMPTATION SHE HAD BEEN TRUE AND KEPT HER RESOLUTION STILL UNBROKEN SELDOM NOW DID THE WARNING BELL SOUND IN HER EAR
2735-160603-0056 AND SELDOM DID THE FLOWER'S FRAGRANCE CEASE TO FLOAT ABOUT HER OR THE FAIRY LIGHT TO BRIGHTEN ALL WHEREON IT FELL SO THROUGH THE LONG COLD WINTER LITTLE ANNIE DWELT LIKE A SUNBEAM IN HER HOME EACH DAY GROWING RICHER IN THE LOVE OF OTHERS AND HAPPIER IN HERSELF
2735-160603-0057 SHE LISTENED ONLY TO THE MUSIC OF THE FAIRY BELL AND THE UNKIND THOUGHT OR FEELING FLED AWAY THE SMILING SPIRITS OF GENTLENESS AND LOVE NESTLED IN HER HEART AND ALL WAS BRIGHT AGAIN SO BETTER AND HAPPIER GREW THE CHILD
2735-160603-0058 FAIRER AND SWEETER GREW THE FLOWER TILL SPRING CAME SMILING OVER THE EARTH AND WOKE THE FLOWERS SET FREE THE STREAMS AND WELCOMED BACK THE BIRDS THEN DAILY DID THE HAPPY CHILD SIT AMONG HER FLOWERS LONGING FOR THE GENTLE ELF TO COME AGAIN
2735-160603-0059 THAT SHE MIGHT TELL HER GRATITUDE FOR ALL THE MAGIC GIFT HAD DONE AT LENGTH ONE DAY
2735-160603-0060 WEARY WITH GAZING AT THE FAR OFF SKY FOR THE LITTLE FORM SHE HOPED WOULD COME SHE BENT TO LOOK WITH JOYFUL LOVE UPON HER BOSOM FLOWER AND AS SHE LOOKED ITS FOLDED LEAVES SPREAD WIDE APART AND RISING SLOWLY FROM THE DEEP WHITE CUP

2735-160603-0066 THE TALL TREES AS THEIR BRANCHES RUSTLED IN THE WIND SANG A LOW DREAMY SONG WHILE THE WAVING GRASS WAS FILLED WITH LITTLE VOICES SHE HAD NEVER HEARD BEFORE BUTTERFLIES WHISPERED LOVELY TALES IN HER EAR AND BIRDS SANG CHEERFUL SONGS IN A SWEET LANGUAGE SHE HAD NEVER UNDERSTOOD BEFORE
