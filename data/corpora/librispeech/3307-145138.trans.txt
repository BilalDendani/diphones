3307-145138-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT THE CRAB SPIDER THE SPIDER THAT SHOWED ME THE EXODUS IN ALL ITS MAGNIFICENCE IS KNOWN OFFICIALLY
3307-145138-0001 OF HURTING NEITHER THE THROAT NOR THE EAR AS IS TOO OFTEN THE CASE WITH SCIENTIFIC NOMENCLATURE WHICH SOUNDS MORE LIKE SNEEZING THAN ARTICULATE SPEECH SINCE IT IS THE RULE TO DIGNIFY PLANTS AND ANIMALS WITH A LATIN LABEL
3307-145138-0002 WHICH SPIT OUT A NAME INSTEAD OF PRONOUNCING IT WHAT WILL POSTERITY DO IN FACE OF THE RISING TIDE OF A BARBAROUS VOCABULARY WHICH UNDER THE PRETENCE OF PROGRESS STIFLES REAL KNOWLEDGE
3307-145138-0003 IT WILL RELEGATE THE WHOLE BUSINESS TO THE QUAGMIRE OF OBLIVION
3307-145138-0004 SOME SORT OF INFORMATION SUCH IS THE TERM CRAB SPIDER APPLIED BY THE ANCIENTS TO THE GROUP TO WHICH THE THOMISUS BELONGS A PRETTY ACCURATE TERM FOR IN THIS CASE THERE IS AN EVIDENT ANALOGY BETWEEN THE SPIDER
3307-145138-0005 AND THE CRUSTACEAN LIKE THE CRAB THE THOMISUS WALKS SIDEWAYS SHE ALSO HAS FORELEGS STRONGER THAN HER HIND LEGS THE ONLY THING WANTING TO COMPLETE THE RESEMBLANCE
3307-145138-0006 IS THE FRONT PAIR OF STONE GAUNTLETS RAISED IN THE ATTITUDE OF SELF DEFENCE THE SPIDER WITH THE CRAB LIKE FIGURE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO MANUFACTURE NETS FOR CATCHING GAME WITHOUT SPRINGS OR SNARES
3307-145138-0007 SHE LIES IN AMBUSH AMONG THE FLOWERS AND AWAITS THE ARRIVAL OF THE QUARRY WHICH SHE KILLS BY ADMINISTERING A SCIENTIFIC STAB IN THE NECK THE THOMISUS IN PARTICULAR THE SUBJECT OF THIS CHAPTER
3307-145138-0008 IS PASSIONATELY ADDICTED TO THE PURSUIT OF THE DOMESTIC BEE I HAVE DESCRIBED THE CONTESTS BETWEEN THE VICTIM AND HER EXECUTIONER AT GREATER LENGTH ELSEWHERE THE BEE APPEARS SEEKING NO QUARREL
3307-145138-0009 INTENT UPON PLUNDER SHE TESTS THE FLOWERS WITH HER TONGUE SHE SELECTS A SPOT THAT WILL YIELD A GOOD RETURN SOON SHE IS WRAPPED UP IN HER HARVESTING WHILE SHE IS FILLING HER BASKETS AND DISTENDING HER CROP THE THOMISUS
3307-145138-0010 THAT BANDIT LURKING UNDER COVER OF THE FLOWERS ISSUES FROM HER HIDING PLACE
3307-145138-0011 STEALS UP CLOSE AND WITH A SUDDEN RUSH NABS HER IN THE NAPE OF THE NECK IN VAIN THE BEE PROTESTS AND DARTS HER STING AT RANDOM THE ASSAILANT DOES NOT LET GO BESIDES THE BITE IN THE NECK IS PARALYSING
3307-145138-0012 BECAUSE THE CERVICAL NERVE CENTRES ARE AFFECTED THE POOR THING'S LEGS STIFFEN AND ALL IS OVER IN A SECOND THE MURDERESS NOW SUCKS THE VICTIM'S BLOOD AT HER EASE AND WHEN SHE HAS DONE
3307-145138-0013 SCORNFULLY FLINGS THE DRAINED CORPSE ASIDE SHE HIDES HERSELF ONCE MORE READY TO BLEED A SECOND GLEANER SHOULD THE OCCASION OFFER THIS SLAUGHTER OF THE BEE ENGAGED IN THE HALLOWED DELIGHTS OF LABOUR
3307-145138-0014 HAS ALWAYS REVOLTED ME WHY SHOULD THERE BE WORKERS TO FEED IDLERS WHY SWEATED
3307-145138-0015 THESE HATEFUL DISCORDS AMID THE GENERAL HARMONY PERPLEX THE THINKER ALL THE MORE AS WE SHALL SEE THE CRUEL VAMPIRE BECOME A MODEL OF DEVOTION WHERE HER FAMILY IS CONCERNED THE OGRE LOVED HIS CHILDREN
3307-145138-0016 HE ATE THE CHILDREN OF OTHERS UNDER THE TYRANNY OF THE STOMACH WE ARE ALL OF US BEASTS AND MEN ALIKE OGRES THE DIGNITY OF LABOUR THE JOY OF LIFE MATERNAL AFFECTION THE TERRORS OF DEATH
3307-145138-0017 ALL THESE DO NOT COUNT IN OTHERS THE MAIN POINT
3307-145138-0018 AND SAVOURY ACCORDING TO THE ETYMOLOGY OF HER NAME
3307-145138-0019 THE THOMISUS SHOULD BE LIKE THE ANCIENT LICTOR WHO BOUND THE SUFFERER TO THE STAKE THE COMPARISON IS NOT INAPPROPRIATE AS REGARDS MANY SPIDERS WHO TIE THEIR PREY WITH A THREAD TO SUBDUE IT AND CONSUME IT AT THEIR EASE
3307-145138-0020 BUT IT JUST HAPPENS THAT THE THOMISUS IS AT VARIANCE WITH HER LABEL SHE DOES NOT FASTEN HER BEE WHO DYING SUDDENLY OF A BITE IN THE NECK OFFERS NO RESISTANCE TO HER CONSUMER
3307-145138-0021 OUR SPIDER'S GODFATHER OVERLOOKED THE EXCEPTION HE DID NOT KNOW OF THE PERFIDIOUS MODE OF ATTACK
3307-145138-0022 IN SOME CASES THE RIGGING OF THE NET IN OTHERS THE SWAN'S DOWN OF THE NEST IS MANUFACTURED THE THOMISUS A FIRST CLASS NEST BUILDER DOES LIKE THE REST SHE HOARDS IN HER ABDOMEN
3307-145138-0023 BUT WITHOUT UNDUE DISPLAY OF OBESITY THE WHEREWITHAL TO HOUSE HER FAMILY SNUGLY CAN THE EXPRESSION ONUSTUS REFER SIMPLY TO HER SLOW AND SIDELONG WALK THE EXPLANATION APPEALS TO ME WITHOUT SATISFYING ME FULLY
3307-145138-0024 EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A SUDDEN ALARM EVERY SPIDER MAINTAINS A SOBER GAIT AND A WARY PACE WHEN ALL IS SAID THE SCIENTIFIC TERM IS COMPOSED OF A MISCONCEPTION AND A WORTHLESS EPITHET HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO NAME ANIMALS RATIONALLY
3307-145138-0025 THE DICTIONARY IS BECOMING EXHAUSTED AND THE CONSTANT FLOOD THAT REQUIRES CATALOGUING MOUNTS INCESSANTLY WEARING OUT OUR COMBINATIONS OF SYLLABLES AS THE TECHNICAL NAME TELLS THE READER NOTHING HOW SHALL HE BE INFORMED
3307-145138-0026 HER FAVOURITE SHRUB IS THE WHITE LEAVED ROCK ROSE CISTUS ALBIDUS WITH THE LARGE PINK CRUMPLED EPHEMERAL BLOOMS THAT LAST BUT A MORNING AND ARE REPLACED NEXT DAY BY FRESH FLOWERS WHICH HAVE BLOSSOMED IN THE COOL DAWN
3307-145138-0027 THIS GLORIOUS EFFLORESCENCE GOES ON FOR FIVE OR SIX WEEKS
3307-145138-0028 FUSSING AND BUSTLING IN THE SPACIOUS WHORL OF THE STAMENS WHICH BEFLOUR THEM WITH YELLOW THEIR PERSECUTRIX KNOWS OF THIS AFFLUENCE SHE POSTS HERSELF IN HER WATCH HOUSE UNDER THE ROSY SCREEN OF A PETAL
3307-145138-0029 CAST YOUR EYES OVER THE FLOWER MORE OR LESS EVERYWHERE IF YOU SEE A BEE LYING LIFELESS WITH LEGS AND TONGUE OUT STRETCHED DRAW NEARER THE THOMISUS WILL BE THERE NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN THE THUG HAS STRUCK HER BLOW
3307-145138-0030 SHE IS DRAINING THE BLOOD OF THE DEPARTED AFTER ALL THIS CUTTER OF BEES THROATS IS A PRETTY A VERY PRETTY CREATURE DESPITE HER UNWIELDY PAUNCH FASHIONED LIKE A SQUAT PYRAMID AND EMBOSSED ON THE BASE ON EITHER SIDE WITH A PIMPLE SHAPED LIKE A CAMEL'S HUMP
3307-145138-0031 THE SKIN MORE PLEASING TO THE EYE THAN ANY SATIN IS MILK WHITE IN SOME IN OTHERS LEMON YELLOW THERE ARE FINE LADIES AMONG THEM WHO ADORN THEIR LEGS WITH A NUMBER OF PINK BRACELETS AND THEIR BACK WITH CARMINE ARABESQUES
3307-145138-0032 A NARROW PALE GREEN RIBBON SOMETIMES EDGES THE RIGHT AND LEFT OF THE BREAST IT IS NOT SO RICH AS THE COSTUME OF THE BANDED EPEIRA BUT MUCH MORE ELEGANT BECAUSE OF ITS SOBERNESS ITS DAINTINESS AND THE ARTFUL BLENDING OF ITS HUES
3307-145138-0033 NOVICE FINGERS WHICH SHRINK FROM TOUCHING ANY OTHER SPIDER ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE ENTICED BY THESE ATTRACTIONS THEY DO NOT FEAR TO HANDLE THE BEAUTEOUS THOMISUS SO GENTLE IN APPEARANCE WELL
3307-145138-0034 WHAT CAN THIS GEM AMONG SPIDERS DO IN THE FIRST PLACE SHE MAKES A NEST WORTHY OF ITS ARCHITECT WITH TWIGS AND HORSE HAIR AND BITS OF WOOL THE GOLDFINCH THE CHAFFINCH
3307-145138-0035 CONSTRUCT AN AERIAL BOWER IN THE FORK OF THE BRANCHES
3307-145138-0036 ONE OF THE UPPER TWIGS OF THE ROCK ROSE HER REGULAR HUNTING GROUND A TWIG WITHERED BY THE HEAT AND POSSESSING A FEW DEAD LEAVES WHICH CURL INTO A LITTLE COTTAGE
3307-145138-0037 ASCENDING AND DESCENDING WITH A GENTLE SWING IN MORE OR LESS EVERY DIRECTION THE LIVING SHUTTLE SWOLLEN WITH SILK WEAVES A BAG WHOSE OUTER CASING BECOMES ONE WITH THE DRY LEAVES AROUND THE WORK WHICH IS PARTLY VISIBLE AND PARTLY HIDDEN BY ITS SUPPORTS
3307-145138-0038 THE MOUTH OF THE RECEPTACLE IS HERMETICALLY CLOSED WITH A LID OF THE SAME WHITE SILK LASTLY A FEW THREADS STRETCHED LIKE A THIN CURTAIN FORM A CANOPY ABOVE THE NEST AND WITH THE CURVED TIPS OF THE LEAVES FRAME A SORT OF ALCOVE WHEREIN THE MOTHER TAKES UP HER ABODE
3307-145138-0039 IT IS MORE THAN A PLACE OF REST AFTER THE FATIGUES OF HER CONFINEMENT IT IS A GUARD ROOM AN INSPECTION POST WHERE THE MOTHER REMAINS SPRAWLING UNTIL THE YOUNGSTERS EXODUS GREATLY EMACIATED BY THE LAYING OF HER EGGS
3307-145138-0040 AND BY HER EXPENDITURE OF SILK SHE LIVES ONLY FOR THE PROTECTION OF HER NEST SHOULD SOME VAGRANT PASS NEAR BY SHE HURRIES FROM HER WATCH TOWER LIFTS A LIMB AND PUTS THE INTRUDER TO FLIGHT IF I TEASE HER WITH A STRAW
3307-145138-0041 SHE PARRIES WITH BIG GESTURES LIKE THOSE OF A PRIZE FIGHTER SHE USES HER FISTS AGAINST MY WEAPON WHEN I PROPOSE TO DISLODGE HER IN VIEW OF CERTAIN EXPERIMENTS I FIND SOME DIFFICULTY IN DOING SO SHE CLINGS TO THE SILKEN FLOOR
3307-145138-0042 SHE FRUSTRATES MY ATTACKS WHICH I AM BOUND TO MODERATE LEST I SHOULD INJURE HER SHE IS NO SOONER ATTRACTED OUTSIDE THAN SHE STUBBORNLY RETURNS TO HER POST SHE DECLINES TO LEAVE HER TREASURE EVEN SO DOES THE NARBONNE
3307-145138-0043 ANY STRANGE PILL WHICH SHE IS GIVEN IN EXCHANGE FOR HER OWN SHE CONFUSES ALIEN PRODUCE WITH THE PRODUCE OF HER OVARIES AND HER SILK FACTORY THOSE HALLOWED WORDS MATERNAL LOVE WERE OUT OF PLACE HERE IT IS AN IMPETUOUS
3307-145138-0044 AN ALMOST MECHANICAL IMPULSE WHEREIN REAL AFFECTION PLAYS NO PART WHATEVER THE BEAUTIFUL SPIDER OF THE ROCK ROSES IS NO MORE GENEROUSLY ENDOWED WHEN MOVED FROM HER NEST TO ANOTHER OF THE SAME KIND SHE SETTLES UPON IT AND NEVER STIRS FROM IT
3307-145138-0045 EVEN THOUGH THE DIFFERENT ARRANGEMENT OF THE LEAFY FENCE BE SUCH AS TO WARN HER THAT SHE IS NOT REALLY AT HOME PROVIDED THAT SHE HAVE SATIN UNDER HER FEET SHE DOES NOT NOTICE HER MISTAKE SHE WATCHES OVER ANOTHER'S NEST WITH THE SAME VIGILANCE
3307-145138-0046 WHICH SHE MIGHT SHOW IN WATCHING OVER HER OWN THE LYCOSA SURPASSES HER IN MATERNAL BLINDNESS SHE FASTENS TO HER SPINNERETS AND DANGLES BY WAY OF A BAG OF EGGS A BALL OF CORK POLISHED WITH MY FILE A PAPER PELLET
3307-145138-0047 A LITTLE BALL OF THREAD IN ORDER TO DISCOVER IF THE THOMISUS IS CAPABLE OF A SIMILAR ERROR I GATHERED SOME BROKEN PIECES OF SILK WORM'S COCOON INTO A CLOSED CONE TURNING THE FRAGMENTS SO AS TO BRING THE SMOOTHER AND MORE DELICATE INNER SURFACE
3307-145138-0048 OUTSIDE MY ATTEMPT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL WHEN REMOVED FROM HER HOME AND PLACED ON THE ARTIFICIAL WALLET THE MOTHER THOMISUS OBSTINATELY REFUSED TO SETTLE THERE CAN SHE BE MORE CLEAR SIGHTED THAN THE LYCOSA
3307-145138-0049 PERHAPS SO LET US NOT BE TOO EXTRAVAGANT WITH OUR PRAISE HOWEVER THE IMITATION OF THE BAG WAS A VERY CLUMSY ONE THE WORK OF LAYING IS FINISHED BY THE END OF MAY
3307-145138-0050 AFTER WHICH LYING FLAT ON THE CEILING OF HER NEST THE MOTHER NEVER LEAVES HER GUARD ROOM EITHER BY NIGHT OR DAY SEEING HER LOOK SO THIN AND WRINKLED I IMAGINE THAT I CAN PLEASE HER BY BRINGING HER A PROVISION OF BEES
3307-145138-0051 AS I WAS WONT TO DO I HAVE MISJUDGED HER NEEDS THE BEE HITHERTO HER FAVOURITE DISH TEMPTS HER NO LONGER IN VAIN DOES THE PREY BUZZ CLOSE BY
3307-145138-0052 TAKES NO NOTICE OF THE WINDFALL SHE LIVES EXCLUSIVELY UPON MATERNAL DEVOTION A COMMENDABLE BUT UNSUBSTANTIAL FARE AND SO I SEE HER PINING AWAY FROM DAY TO DAY BECOMING MORE AND MORE WRINKLED
3307-145138-0053 WHAT IS THE WITHERED THING WAITING FOR BEFORE EXPIRING SHE IS WAITING FOR HER CHILDREN TO EMERGE THE DYING CREATURE IS STILL OF USE TO THEM WHEN THE BANDED EPEIRA'S LITTLE ONES ISSUE FROM THEIR BALLOON
3307-145138-0054 THEY HAVE LONG BEEN ORPHANS THERE IS NONE TO COME TO THEIR ASSISTANCE AND THEY HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO FREE THEMSELVES UNAIDED THE BALLOON HAS TO SPLIT AUTOMATICALLY AND TO SCATTER THE YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR FLOSSY MATTRESS ALL MIXED UP TOGETHER
3307-145138-0055 IMPATIENTLY UNDER THE SILKEN CEILING HERSELF MADE A HOLE IN THE BAG SHE PERSISTS IN LIVING FOR FIVE OR SIX WEEKS DESPITE HER SHATTERED HEALTH SO AS TO GIVE A LAST HELPING HAND AND OPEN THE DOOR FOR HER FAMILY
3307-145138-0056 AFTER PERFORMING THIS DUTY SHE GENTLY LETS HERSELF DIE HUGGING HER NEST AND TURNING INTO A SHRIVELLED RELIC WHEN JULY COMES THE LITTLE ONES EMERGE
3307-145138-0057 IN VIEW OF THEIR ACROBATIC HABITS I HAVE PLACED A BUNDLE OF SLENDER TWIGS AT THE TOP OF THE CAGE IN WHICH THEY WERE BORN ALL OF THEM PASS THROUGH THE WIRE GAUZE AND FORM A GROUP ON THE SUMMIT OF THE BRUSHWOOD WHERE THEY SWIFTLY WEAVE A SPACIOUS LOUNGE OF CRISS CROSS THREADS
3307-145138-0058 HERE THEY REMAIN PRETTY QUIETLY FOR A DAY OR TWO THEN FOOT BRIDGES BEGIN TO BE FLUNG FROM ONE OBJECT TO THE NEXT THIS IS THE OPPORTUNE MOMENT I PUT THE BUNCH LADEN WITH BEASTIES ON A SMALL TABLE IN THE SHADE
3307-145138-0059 BEFORE THE OPEN WINDOW SOON THE EXODUS COMMENCES BUT SLOWLY AND UNSTEADILY THERE ARE HESITATIONS RETROGRESSIONS PERPENDICULAR FALLS AT THE END OF A THREAD ASCENTS THAT BRING THE HANGING SPIDER UP AGAIN
3307-145138-0060 IN SHORT MUCH ADO FOR A POOR RESULT AS MATTERS CONTINUE TO DRAG IT OCCURS TO ME AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK TO TAKE THE BUNDLE OF BRUSHWOOD SWARMING WITH THE LITTLE SPIDERS ALL EAGER TO BE OFF AND PLACE IT ON THE WINDOW SILL IN THE GLARE OF THE SUN
3307-145138-0061 AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF HEAT AND LIGHT THE SCENE ASSUMES A VERY DIFFERENT ASPECT THE EMIGRANTS RUN TO THE TOP OF THE TWIGS BUSTLE ABOUT ACTIVELY IT BECOMES A BEWILDERING ROPE YARD
3307-145138-0062 WHERE THOUSANDS OF LEGS ARE DRAWING THE HEMP FROM THE SPINNERETS I DO NOT SEE THE ROPES MANUFACTURED AND SENT FLOATING AT THE MERCY OF THE AIR BUT I GUESS THEIR PRESENCE THREE OR FOUR SPIDERS START AT A TIME
3307-145138-0063 EACH GOING HER OWN WAY IN DIRECTIONS INDEPENDENT OF HER NEIGHBOURS ALL ARE MOVING UPWARDS ALL ARE CLIMBING SOME SUPPORT AS CAN BE PERCEIVED BY THE NIMBLE MOTION OF THEIR LEGS MOREOVER THE ROAD IS VISIBLE BEHIND THE CLIMBER
3307-145138-0064 IT IS OF DOUBLE THICKNESS THANKS TO AN ADDED THREAD THEN AT A CERTAIN HEIGHT INDIVIDUAL MOVEMENT CEASES THE TINY ANIMAL SOARS IN SPACE AND SHINES LIT UP BY THE SUN SOFTLY IT SWAYS
3307-145138-0065 THERE IS A SLIGHT BREEZE OUTSIDE THE FLOATING CABLE HAS SNAPPED AND THE CREATURE HAS GONE OFF BORNE ON ITS PARACHUTE
3307-145138-0066 LIKE A SPOT OF LIGHT AGAINST THE DARK FOLIAGE OF THE NEAR CYPRESSES
3307-145138-0067 IT CROSSES OVER THE CYPRESS SCREEN IT DISAPPEARS OTHERS FOLLOW SOME HIGHER SOME LOWER HITHER AND THITHER BUT THE THRONG HAS FINISHED ITS PREPARATIONS THE HOUR HAS COME TO DISPERSE IN SWARMS
3307-145138-0068 WE NOW SEE FROM THE CREST OF THE BRUSHWOOD A CONTINUOUS SPRAY OF STARTERS WHO SHOOT UP LIKE MICROSCOPIC PROJECTILES AND MOUNT IN A SPREADING CLUSTER IN THE END IT IS LIKE THE BOUQUET AT THE FINISH OF A PYROTECHNIC DISPLAY
3307-145138-0069 THE SHEAF OF ROCKETS FIRED SIMULTANEOUSLY THE COMPARISON IS CORRECT DOWN TO THE DAZZLING LIGHT ITSELF FLAMING IN THE SUN LIKE SO MANY GLEAMING POINTS
3307-145138-0070 WHAT AN ENTRANCE INTO THE WORLD CLUTCHING ITS AERONAUTIC THREAD THE MINUTE CREATURE MOUNTS
3307-145138-0071 SOONER OR LATER NEARER OR FARTHER THE FALL COMES TO LIVE WE HAVE TO DESCEND OFTEN VERY LOW ALAS THE CRESTED LARK CRUMBLES THE MULE DROPPINGS IN THE ROAD
3307-145138-0072 AND THUS PICKS UP HIS FOOD THE OATEN GRAIN WHICH HE WOULD NEVER FIND BY SOARING IN THE SKY HIS THROAT SWOLLEN WITH SONG WE HAVE TO DESCEND THE STOMACH'S INEXORABLE CLAIMS DEMAND IT
3307-145138-0073 THE SPIDERLING THEREFORE TOUCHES LAND GRAVITY TEMPERED BY THE PARACHUTE IS KIND TO HER THE REST OF HER STORY ESCAPES ME
3307-145138-0074 WHAT INFINITELY TINY MIDGES DOES SHE CAPTURE BEFORE POSSESSING THE STRENGTH TO STAB HER BEE WHAT ARE THE METHODS WHAT THE WILES OF ATOM CONTENDING WITH ATOM
3307-145138-0075 WE SHALL FIND HER AGAIN IN SPRING GROWN QUITE LARGE AND CROUCHING AMONG THE FLOWERS
