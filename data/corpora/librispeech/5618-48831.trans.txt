5618-48831-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY THREE THE TIME WILL COME DID YOU HEAR THAT YOUNG EAMES IS STAYING AT GUESTWICK MANOR AS THESE WERE THE FIRST WORDS WHICH THE SQUIRE SPOKE TO MISSUS DALE AS THEY WALKED TOGETHER UP TO THE GREAT HOUSE
5618-48831-0001 AT GUESTWICK MANOR SAID MISSUS DALE
5618-48831-0002 DO YOU HEAR THAT BELL THERE'S PROMOTION FOR MASTER JOHNNY DON'T YOU REMEMBER MAMMA SAID BELL THAT HE HELPED HIS LORDSHIP IN HIS TROUBLE WITH THE BULL LILY WHO REMEMBERED ACCURATELY ALL THE PASSAGES OF HER LAST INTERVIEW WITH JOHN EAMES SAID NOTHING
5618-48831-0003 BUT FELT IN SOME SORT SORE AT THE IDEA THAT HE SHOULD BE SO NEAR HER AT SUCH A TIME IN SOME UNCONSCIOUS WAY SHE HAD LIKED HIM FOR COMING TO HER AND SAYING ALL THAT HE DID SAY SHE VALUED HIM MORE HIGHLY
5618-48831-0004 AFTER THAT SCENE THAN SHE DID BEFORE BUT NOW SHE WOULD FEEL HERSELF INJURED AND HURT IF HE EVER MADE HIS WAY INTO HER PRESENCE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES AS THEY EXISTED
5618-48831-0005 I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT THAT LORD DE GUEST WAS THE MAN TO SHOW SO MUCH GRATITUDE FOR SO SLIGHT A FAVOUR SAID THE SQUIRE HOWEVER I'M GOING TO DINE THERE TO MORROW TO MEET YOUNG EAMES SAID MISSUS DALE
5618-48831-0006 YES ESPECIALLY TO MEET YOUNG EAMES AT LEAST I'VE BEEN VERY SPECIALLY ASKED TO COME AND I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT HE IS TO BE THERE AND IS BERNARD GOING INDEED I'M NOT SAID BERNARD I SHALL COME OVER AND DINE WITH YOU
5618-48831-0007 A HALF FORMED IDEA FLITTED ACROSS LILY'S MIND TEACHING HER TO IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT SHE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE CONCERNED IN THIS ARRANGEMENT BUT THE THOUGHT VANISHED AS QUICKLY AS IT CAME MERELY LEAVING SOME SORENESS BEHIND IT
5618-48831-0008 THERE ARE CERTAIN MALADIES WHICH MAKE THE WHOLE BODY SORE THE PATIENT LET HIM BE TOUCHED ON ANY POINT LET HIM EVEN BE NEARLY TOUCHED WILL ROAR WITH AGONY AS THOUGH HIS WHOLE BODY HAD BEEN BRUISED SO IT IS ALSO WITH MALADIES OF THE MIND
5618-48831-0009 BECAUSE SHE HAD THE STRENGTH TO WALK AS THOUGH SHE DID NOT BEAR IT NOTHING HAPPENED TO HER OR IN HER PRESENCE THAT DID NOT IN SOME WAY CONNECT ITSELF WITH HER MISERY HER UNCLE WAS GOING OVER TO MEET JOHN EAMES AT LORD DE GUEST'S
5618-48831-0010 OF COURSE THE MEN THERE WOULD TALK ABOUT HER AND ALL SUCH TALKING WAS AN INJURY TO HER THE AFTERNOON OF THAT DAY DID NOT PASS AWAY BRIGHTLY AS LONG AS THE SERVANTS WERE IN THE ROOM THE DINNER WENT ON
5618-48831-0011 MUCH AS OTHER DINNERS AT SUCH TIMES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HYPOCRISY MUST ALWAYS BE PRACTISED IN CLOSELY DOMESTIC CIRCLES AT MIXED DINNER PARTIES PEOPLE CAN TALK BEFORE RICHARD AND WILLIAM
5618-48831-0012 PEOPLE SO MIXED DO NOT TALK TOGETHER THEIR INWARD HOME THOUGHTS BUT WHEN CLOSE FRIENDS ARE TOGETHER A LITTLE CONSCIOUS RETICENCE IS PRACTISED TILL THE DOOR IS TILED AT SUCH A MEETING AS THIS THAT CONSCIOUS RETICENCE
5618-48831-0013 WAS OF SERVICE AND CREATED AN EFFECT WHICH WAS SALUTARY WHEN THE DOOR WAS TILED AND WHEN THE SERVANTS WERE GONE HOW COULD THEY BE MERRY TOGETHER BY WHAT MIRTH SHOULD THE BEARDS BE MADE TO WAG ON THAT CHRISTMAS DAY
5618-48831-0014 HE WAS WITH LORD DE GUEST AT PAWKINS'S WHY DIDN'T YOU GO AND SEE HIM ASKED MISSUS DALE WELL I DON'T KNOW HE DID NOT SEEM TO WISH IT I SHALL GO DOWN TO TORQUAY IN FEBRUARY I MUST BE UP IN LONDON YOU KNOW IN A FORTNIGHT FOR GOOD
5618-48831-0015 MAKING HER FEEL THAT HER WOUND WAS AGAIN OPENED I WANT HIM TO GIVE UP HIS PROFESSION ALTOGETHER SAID THE SQUIRE SPEAKING FIRMLY AND SLOWLY IT WOULD BE BETTER I THINK FOR BOTH OF US THAT HE SHOULD DO SO
5618-48831-0016 WOULD IT BE WISE AT HIS TIME OF LIFE SAID MISSUS DALE AND WHEN HE HAS BEEN DOING SO WELL I THINK IT WOULD BE WISE IF HE WERE MY SON IT WOULD BE THOUGHT BETTER THAT HE SHOULD LIVE HERE UPON THE PROPERTY AMONG THE PEOPLE
5618-48831-0017 WHO ARE TO BECOME HIS TENANTS THAN REMAIN UP IN LONDON OR PERHAPS BE SENT TO INDIA HE HAS ONE PROFESSION AS THE HEIR OF THIS PLACE AND THAT I THINK SHOULD BE ENOUGH I SHOULD HAVE BUT AN IDLE LIFE OF IT DOWN HERE SAID BERNARD
5618-48831-0018 AND SAT QUITE SILENT WITH DEMURE COUNTENANCE PERHAPS EVEN WITH SOMETHING OF STERNNESS IN HER FACE BUT THE FACT IS SAID MISSUS DALE SPEAKING IN A LOW TONE AND HAVING WELL CONSIDERED WHAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO SAY
5618-48831-0019 THAT BERNARD IS NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AS YOUR SON WHY NOT SAID THE SQUIRE I HAVE EVEN OFFERED TO SETTLE THE PROPERTY ON HIM IF HE WILL LEAVE THE SERVICE YOU DO NOT OWE HIM SO MUCH AS YOU WOULD OWE YOUR SON AND THEREFORE
5618-48831-0020 HE DOES NOT OWE YOU AS MUCH AS HE WOULD OWE HIS FATHER IF YOU MEAN THAT I CANNOT CONSTRAIN HIM I KNOW THAT WELL ENOUGH AS REGARDS MONEY I HAVE OFFERED TO DO FOR HIM QUITE AS MUCH AS ANY FATHER WOULD FEEL CALLED UPON TO DO FOR AN ONLY SON
5618-48831-0021 FEELING THAT HE COULD NOT GO ON IN BELL'S PRESENCE IF HE SHOULD MARRY SAID MISSUS DALE IT MAY WELL BE THAT HIS WIFE WOULD LIKE A HOUSE OF HER OWN WOULDN'T SHE HAVE THIS HOUSE SAID THE SQUIRE ANGRILY ISN'T IT BIG ENOUGH I ONLY WANT ONE ROOM FOR MYSELF
5618-48831-0022 REGARDING HER WITH THAT PAINFUL SPECIAL TENDERNESS LILY WHO WAS SITTING NEXT TO MISSUS DALE PUT HER HAND OUT SECRETLY AND GOT HOLD OF HER MOTHER'S THEREBY INDICATING THAT SHE DID NOT INTEND TO OCCUPY THE CELL OFFERED TO HER BY HER UNCLE
5618-48831-0023 OR TO LOOK TO HIM AS THE COMPANION OF HER MONASTIC SECLUSION AFTER THAT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE THEN SAID AS TO BERNARD'S PROSPECTS MISSUS HEARN IS DINING AT THE VICARAGE I SUPPOSE ASKED THE SQUIRE
5618-48831-0024 YES SHE WENT IN AFTER CHURCH SAID BELL I SAW HER GO WITH MISSUS BOYCE SHE TOLD ME SHE NEVER WOULD DINE WITH THEM AGAIN AFTER DARK IN WINTER SAID MISSUS DALE THE LAST TIME SHE WAS THERE THE BOY LET THE LAMP BLOW OUT AS SHE WAS GOING HOME AND SHE LOST HER WAY
5618-48831-0025 THE TRUTH WAS SHE WAS ANGRY BECAUSE MISTER BOYCE DIDN'T GO WITH HER SHE'S ALWAYS ANGRY SAID THE SQUIRE SHE HARDLY SPEAKS TO ME NOW WHEN SHE PAID HER RENT THE OTHER DAY TO JOLLIFFE SHE SAID SHE HOPED IT WOULD DO ME MUCH GOOD AS THOUGH SHE THOUGHT ME A BRUTE FOR TAKING IT
5618-48831-0026 SHE'S VERY OLD YOU KNOW SAID BELL I'D GIVE HER THE HOUSE FOR NOTHING IF I WERE YOU UNCLE SAID LILY NO MY DEAR IF YOU WERE ME YOU WOULD NOT I SHOULD BE VERY WRONG TO DO SO
5618-48831-0027 WHY SHOULD MISSUS HEARN HAVE HER HOUSE FOR NOTHING ANY MORE THAN HER MEAT OR HER CLOTHES IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE REASONABLE WERE I TO GIVE HER SO MUCH MONEY INTO HER HAND YEARLY BUT IT WOULD BE WRONG IN ME TO DO SO SEEING THAT SHE IS NOT AN OBJECT OF CHARITY
5618-48831-0028 AND IT WOULD BE WRONG IN HER TO TAKE IT AND SHE WOULDN'T TAKE IT SAID MISSUS DALE I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD BUT IF SHE DID I'M SURE SHE WOULD GRUMBLE BECAUSE IT WASN'T DOUBLE THE AMOUNT AND IF MISTER BOYCE HAD GONE HOME WITH HER
5618-48831-0029 SHE WOULD HAVE GRUMBLED BECAUSE HE WALKED TOO FAST SHE IS VERY OLD SAID BELL AGAIN BUT NEVERTHELESS SHE OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER THAN TO SPEAK DISPARAGINGLY OF ME TO MY SERVANTS SHE SHOULD HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR HERSELF
5618-48831-0030 AND THE SQUIRE SHOWED BY THE TONE OF HIS VOICE THAT HE THOUGHT VERY MUCH ABOUT IT IT WAS VERY LONG AND VERY DULL THAT CHRISTMAS EVENING MAKING BERNARD FEEL STRONGLY THAT HE WOULD BE VERY FOOLISH TO GIVE UP HIS PROFESSION
5618-48831-0031 AND TIE HIMSELF DOWN TO A LIFE AT ALLINGTON WOMEN ARE MORE ACCUSTOMED THAN MEN TO LONG DULL UNEMPLOYED HOURS AND THEREFORE MISSUS DALE AND HER DAUGHTERS BORE THE TEDIUM COURAGEOUSLY WHILE HE YAWNED STRETCHED HIMSELF
5618-48831-0032 THEY SAT DEMURELY LISTENING AS THE SQUIRE LAID DOWN THE LAW ON SMALL MATTERS AND CONTRADICTING HIM OCCASIONALLY WHEN THE SPIRIT OF EITHER OF THEM PROMPTED HER SPECIALLY TO DO SO OF COURSE YOU KNOW MUCH BETTER THAN I DO HE WOULD SAY
5618-48831-0033 NOT AT ALL MISSUS DALE WOULD ANSWER I DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT SO THE EVENING WORE ITSELF AWAY AND WHEN THE SQUIRE WAS LEFT ALONE AT HALF PAST NINE HE DID NOT FEEL THAT THE DAY HAD PASSED BADLY WITH HIM
5618-48831-0034 THAT WAS HIS STYLE OF LIFE AND HE EXPECTED NO MORE FROM IT THAN HE GOT HE DID NOT LOOK TO FIND THINGS VERY PLEASANT AND IF NOT HAPPY HE WAS AT ANY RATE CONTENTED
5618-48831-0035 ONLY THINK OF JOHNNY EAMES BEING AT GUESTWICK MANOR SAID BELL AS THEY WERE GOING HOME I DON'T SEE WHY HE SHOULDN'T BE THERE SAID LILY I WOULD RATHER IT SHOULD BE HE THAN I BECAUSE LADY JULIA IS SO GRUMPY
5618-48831-0036 BUT ASKING YOUR UNCLE CHRISTOPHER ESPECIALLY TO MEET HIM SAID MISSUS DALE THERE MUST BE SOME REASON FOR IT THEN LILY FELT THE SORENESS COME UPON HER AGAIN AND SPOKE NO FURTHER UPON THE SUBJECT
5618-48831-0037 AND THAT LILY'S SORENESS WAS NOT FALSE IN ITS MYSTERIOUS FOREBODINGS EAMES ON THE EVENING AFTER HIS DINNER AT PAWKINS'S HAD SEEN THE EARL AND EXPLAINED TO HIM
5618-48831-0038 BUT THAT HE COULD REMAIN OVER THE TUESDAY HE MUST BE AT HIS OFFICE BY TWELVE ON WEDNESDAY AND COULD MANAGE TO DO THAT BY AN EARLY TRAIN FROM GUESTWICK
5618-48831-0039 VERY WELL JOHNNY SAID THE EARL TALKING TO HIS YOUNG FRIEND WITH THE BEDROOM CANDLE IN HIS HAND AS HE WAS GOING UP TO DRESS
