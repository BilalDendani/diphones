8506-293168-0000 ONE DAY A VISITOR CAME TO THE HOUSE OF JESSE DAVID'S FATHER THIS VISITOR WAS NO OTHER THAN THE PROPHET SAMUEL HE HAD RECEIVED A COMMAND FROM THE LORD TELLING HIM TO TAKE A VIAL OF OIL AND SEEK THE HOUSE OF JESSE
8506-293168-0001 THEN THE VOICE OF THE LORD AGAIN SPOKE TO SAMUEL IT SAID ARISE ANOINT HIM FOR THIS IS HE AS SOON AS THE PROPHET HAD ANOINTED DAVID WITH THE OIL THE YOUNG MAN WAS FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT AND POWER OF GOD
8506-293168-0002 AT THE SAME TIME THEY LEFT KING SAUL WHO DID MANY FOOLISH AND BAD DEEDS AFTER THIS BUT WHAT OF DAVID DID HE GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND DECLARE HIMSELF THE FUTURE KING OF ISRAEL NOT SO HE CONTINUED TO LIVE HIS PEACEFUL QUIET LIFE AS A SHEPHERD
8506-293168-0003 HE LEARNED TO SING AND PLAY UPON THE HARP HE NOW SHOWED HIMSELF INDEED THE SWEET SINGER OF ISRAEL HE BEGAN TO SHOW POWER IN OTHER WAYS TOO MANY TIMES THE FIERCE LIONS AND SAVAGE BEARS CAME CREEPING UPON HIS FLOCKS
8506-293168-0004 MANY TIMES DAVID MET AND OVERPOWERED THEM WITH THE STRENGTH GIVEN TO HIM BY THE LORD IT SEEMS AS THOUGH I CAN SEE HIM GUARDING HIS FLOCKS SAID SOLOMON AS LEVI STOPPED TALKING TO REST FOR A MOMENT HIS BEAUTIFUL BLACK EYES ARE LOOKING OUT INTO THE NIGHT AND WATCHING FOR DANGER
8506-293168-0005 HE LOOKS AT HIS SLEEPING SHEEP TO SEE IF ALL ARE SAFE THEN HE HEARS THE SOUND OF FOES DRAWING NEAR AND SPRINGS TO MEET THEM I LIKE BEST TO THINK OF HIM WITH A TINY LAMB IN HIS ARMS SAID ESTHER HE HOLDS IT LOVINGLY AGAINST HIS BREAST AS THOUGH HE WOULD SAY
8506-293168-0006 THEY BECAME MORE AND MORE DARING UNTIL AT LAST THEY GATHERED ON THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN RIGHT HERE IN ISRAEL THREE OF DAVID'S BROTHERS WERE FIGHTING IN SAUL'S ARMY AND WENT OUT TO MEET THE PHILISTINES DAVID OFTEN WENT TO THE CAMP TO VISIT HIS BROTHERS
8506-293168-0007 DAVID WAS NOT USED TO SUCH THINGS THE ARMOUR WEIGHED HIM DOWN SO THAT HE STAGGERED AND ALMOST FELL HE SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME TO CARRY ONLY SUCH WEAPONS AS I KNOW LET ME TAKE MY SHEPHERD'S STAFF AND THE SLING I HAVE USED SO OFTEN IN MEETING THE WILD BEASTS
8506-293168-0008 HE WAS ALLOWED TO DO AS HE CHOSE HE WENT FORTH TO MEET THE GIANT WITH NOTHING TO HELP HIM SAVE HIS STAFF AND SLING AND WHAT DID THE GIANT GOLIATH SAY WHEN HE SAW THE YOUNG SHEPHERD DRAW NEAR HE SPOKE IN SCORNFUL WORDS
8506-293168-0009 AS SOON AS DAVID SAW THE SUCCESS OF HIS SHOT HE RUSHED TO THE GIANT'S SIDE SEIZED HIS SWORD AND CUT OFF HIS HEAD THE WATCHING PHILISTINES WERE FILLED WITH FEAR THEY BEGAN TO FLEE BUT SAUL'S ARMY FOLLOWED AND OVERTOOK THEM AND KILLED GREAT NUMBERS
8506-293168-0010 WHEN HE LEARNED OF DAVID'S POWER TO PLAY AND SING HE OFTEN ASKED THE YOUNG SHEPHERD TO QUIET HIS ANGRY FEELINGS WITH THE SWEET MUSIC OF HIS HARP AND VOICE HE WAS VERY FOND OF DAVID IN THOSE DAYS BUT AFTER A WHILE HE BECAME JEALOUS WHEN HE HEARD THE CONSTANT PRAISES OF THE PEOPLE
8506-293168-0011 BUT SAUL SOON FOUND THAT HIS YOUNGER DAUGHTER LOVED DAVID HE NOW SAID YOU MAY HAVE MICHAL IF YOU WILL FIRST KILL ONE HUNDRED PHILISTINES HE ONLY SAID THIS BECAUSE HE HOPED DAVID WOULD BE KILLED BY THE ENEMY I KNOW WHAT DAVID DID EXCLAIMED SOLOMON WHO COULD KEEP STILL NO LONGER
8506-293168-0012 ALL HIS WICKED FEELINGS CAME BACK AND HE HIRED SOME BAD MEN TO TAKE DAVID BY SURPRISE WHEN HE WAS ASLEEP AND KILL HIM SOMEHOW OR OTHER MICHAL HEARD OF THE PLOT SHE WARNED DAVID AND HE FLED FROM THE PALACE
8506-293168-0013 BUT MICHAL DID NOT STOP HERE SHE MADE THE SHAPE OF A MAN AND PLACED IT IN DAVID'S BED IN THIS WAY THE BAD MEN WHO CAME TO KILL HIM WERE DECEIVED I AM RATHER TIRED REBECCA SAID LEVI WHEN HE HAD GOT THIS FAR IN HIS STORY
8506-293168-0014 WON'T YOU GO ON AND TELL THE CHILDREN ABOUT DAVID'S FLIGHT CERTAINLY SAID HIS WIFE IN HER SWEET CLEAR VOICE SHE MADE A PICTURE OF DAVID HIDING NEAR RAMAH BUT HE WAS NOT SAFE FOR SAUL HEARD WHERE HE WAS HE SENT MEN THERE TO TAKE HIM PRISONER
8506-293168-0015 A STRANGE THING HAPPENED ON THEIR WAY THEY WERE OVERCOME BY THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD AND THEY DID NOT DARE SEIZE DAVID WHEN SAUL WAS TOLD HOW THEY HAD FAILED HE WENT HIMSELF IN SEARCH OF DAVID BUT HE TOO WAS OVERPOWERED BY THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD AND WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED
8506-293168-0016 INSTEAD OF HARMING HIM HE ASKED DAVID TO COME BACK TO THE PALACE BUT DAVID DID NOT FEEL SURE THAT SAUL WAS A TRUE FRIEND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE THE WISEST THING FOR HIM TO SEE JONATHAN FIRST AND ASK HIM TO FIND OUT HOW HIS FATHER REALLY FELT JONATHAN WAS A TRUE FRIEND
8506-293168-0017 IT DID NOT TAKE HIM LONG TO LEARN THAT SAUL WAS AS MUCH AN ENEMY AS EVER HE MUST NOW LET DAVID KNOW ABOUT IT AND PREVENT HIS RETURN TO THE PALACE HE KNEW WHERE DAVID WAS HIDING BUT HE DID NOT DARE SEEK HIM OUT INSTEAD OF THAT HE STARTED FROM THE PALACE TO GO SHOOTING
8506-293168-0018 WHEN REBECCA HAD GOT THUS FAR MIRIAM LOOKED A LITTLE PERPLEXED I DON'T SEE HOW DAVID COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANT SHE SAID HE HAD AGREED WITH JONATHAN THAT CERTAIN WORDS SHOULD MEAN CERTAIN THINGS MY DEAR OH I SEE NOW GO ON WITH THE STORY PLEASE
8506-293168-0019 HE ASKED FOR THE SWORD OF GOLIATH WHICH WAS IN THE HIGH PRIEST'S KEEPING HE ALSO ASKED FOR FIVE SACRED LOAVES OF SHEWBREAD WHICH NO ONE DARED TO EAT EXCEPT THE PRIESTS WHEN THESE HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM HE HURRIED AWAY HE HAD ONE ADVENTURE AFTER ANOTHER
8506-293168-0020 IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT HE HID IN THE CAVE OF ADULLAM HIS BROTHERS AND A GREAT MANY OTHER ISRAELITES JOINED HIM THERE WHILE HE WAS HIDING IN THE CAVE OF ADULLAM THE PROPHET OF GOD CAME TO HIM TELLING HIM TO GO INTO THE LAND OF JUDAH
8506-293168-0021 HE STARTED AT ONCE TO OBEY THE PROPHET'S COMMAND SAUL HEARD WHERE HE WAS AND FOLLOWED HIM ON HIS WAY THE KING HEARD HOW DAVID HAD BEEN HELPED BY THE HIGH PRIEST HE WAS SO ANGRY THAT HE ORDERED NOT ONLY THE HIGH PRIEST TO BE KILLED BUT ALSO HIS EIGHTY FIVE HELPERS
8506-293168-0022 AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWN IN WHICH HE LIVED THE SON OF THE HIGH PRIEST MANAGED TO ESCAPE HE FLED TO DAVID AND TOLD HIM THE SAD STORY YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW BAD DAVID FELT WHEN HE LEARNED WHAT HAD HAPPENED THROUGH HIS OWN DECEIT
8506-293168-0023 BUT HIS MIND WAS KEPT BUSY WITH PLANS TO KEEP OUT OF SAUL'S REACH FOR THE KING FOLLOWED HIM FROM PLACE TO PLACE ONE NIGHT WHILE DAVID WAS HIDING IN A CAVE THE KING STOPPED TO REST AT THAT VERY SPOT LITTLE DID HE DREAM WHO WAS SO NEAR HIM
8506-293168-0024 HE HELD UP THE PIECE HE HAD CUT FROM SAUL'S CLOAK THEN THE KING KNEW HE HAD BEEN IN DAVID'S POWER HE SAW HOW GENEROUSLY HE HAD BEEN TREATED HE FELT SUCH SHAME THAT HE DETERMINED TO DO THE YOUNG MAN NO MORE HARM
8506-293168-0025 NO ONE SAW THEM AS THEY STOLE ALONG NO ONE HEARD THEM AS DAVID STEPPED TO THE SIDE OF THE SLEEPING SAUL AND SEIZED HIS SPEAR AND CUP THEN AWAY THEY SPED TILL THEY REACHED THE HILLTOP OPPOSITE THE ONE WHERE SAUL HAD TAKEN HIS STAND
8506-293168-0026 DAVID NOW CRIED OUT IN A LOUD VOICE TO WAKE THE SLEEPING ARMY HE SHOWED THE CUP AND SPEAR HE HAD TAKEN AWAY FROM SAUL'S TENT SAUL SAW THAT DAVID HAD SPARED HIS LIFE A SECOND TIME HE WAS AGAIN FILLED WITH GRATITUDE
8506-293168-0027 BUT DAVID HAD LEARNED NOT TO TRUST HIM HE SOUGHT A HOME AMONG THE PHILISTINES AND HELPED THEM IN THEIR WARS THEY TREATED HIM WITH GREAT KINDNESS AND THEIR KING BECAME HIS TRUE FRIEND NOT LONG AFTER THIS THE PHILISTINES WENT OUT TO BATTLE AGAINST SAUL
8506-293168-0028 DAVID WAS NOT WITH THEM AT THIS TIME IT WAS A SAD DAY FOR THE ISRAELITES THEY WERE BADLY BEATEN AND SAUL'S SONS WERE KILLED YES EVEN DAVID'S FAITHFUL FRIEND JONATHAN LOST HIS LIFE SAUL WAS OVERCOME WITH SORROW
8506-293168-0029 HE THREW HIMSELF UPON HIS SWORD AND DIED BY HIS OWN HAND WHEN DAVID HEARD THE NEWS HE FELT VERY SAD HE MOURNED BITTERLY OVER THE DEATH OF JONATHAN BUT THIS COULD NOT BE HELPED NOW AND THERE WAS MUCH WORK TO DO FOR HIS PEOPLE
8506-293168-0030 HOW JUST HE IS SAID THE PEOPLE HOW BRAVE HE IS ALL CRIED NOT LONG AFTER THIS HE WAS CROWNED KING OF ISRAEL AT FIRST HE LIVED IN HEBRON BUT AFTERWARD HE WENT TO JERUSALEM WHERE A BEAUTIFUL PALACE WAS BUILT FOR HIM AND HIS FAMILY
8506-293168-0031 AND NOW HE WENT ON AND BECAME GREAT FOR THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS WAS WITH HIM REBECCA BOWED HER HEAD AS SHE SAID THESE WORDS LET US CHANT ONE OF THE PSALMS OF DAVID SAID LEVI IT IS A GOOD WAY TO END OUR AFTERNOON
