8666-293943-0000 I HOPE I SEE YOU WELL SIR SIMON SAID DURHAM SHAKING HANDS HE WAS A SMART WELL DRESSED HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOW WITH AN UP TO DATE AIR AND FORMED A STRIKING CONTRAST TO THE BARONET IN HIS ANTIQUE GARB
8666-293943-0001 AND HE MENTALLY WONDERED WHY THE OLD MAN HAD BROUGHT HIM ALONG SIR SIMON HAD NEVER SPOKEN VERY WELL OF JULIUS BUT THEN HE RARELY SAID A GOOD WORD OF ANYONE I AM AS WELL AS CAN BE EXPECTED SAID SIR SIMON GRUMPILY
8666-293943-0002 TAKING HIS SEAT NEAR THE TABLE WHICH WAS COVERED WITH BOOKS AND PAPERS AND BRIEFS AND RED TAPE AND ALL THE PARAPHERNALIA OF LEGAL AFFAIRS ABOUT THAT WILL OF MINE
8666-293943-0003 AND STILL MORE PERPLEXED AS TO THE BARONET'S MOTIVE FOR BRINGING THE YOUNG MAN

8666-293943-0005 ALL THE MORE REASON I SHOULD NOT HEAR IT READ SAID JULIUS STILL ON HIS FEET SIR SIMON SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND TURNED HIS BACK ON HIS TOO PARTICULAR NEPHEW
8666-293943-0006 IT WAS NOT THE LAWYER'S BUSINESS TO ARGUE IN THIS ESPECIAL INSTANCE SO HE SPEEDILY SUMMONED A CLERK THE WILL WAS BROUGHT CAREFULLY ENGROSSED ON PARCHMENT AND DURHAM RUSTLED THE GREAT SHEETS AS HE RESUMED HIS SEAT YOU WISH ME TO READ IT ALL
8666-293943-0007 HE ASKED HESITATINGLY SIR SIMON NODDED AND LEANING HIS CHIN ON THE KNOB OF HIS CANE DISPOSED HIMSELF TO LISTEN
8666-293943-0008 WHICH DID NOT ESCAPE HIS UNCLE'S NOTICE AND HE SMILED IN A GRIM WAY DURHAM WITHOUT FURTHER PREAMBLE READ THE CONTENTS OF THE WILL CLEARLY AND DELIBERATELY WITHOUT AS MUCH AS A GLANCE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PERSON INTERESTED
8666-293943-0009 THIS WAS JULIUS AND HE GREW PALE WITH PLEASURE AS THE LAWYER PROCEEDED THE WILL PROVIDED LEGACIES FOR OLD SERVANTS BUT NO MENTION WAS MADE OF MISSUS GILROY
8666-293943-0010 AND SECRETLY WONDERED AT VARIOUS BEQUESTS WERE MADE TO FORMER FRIENDS AND ARRANGEMENTS SET FORTH AS TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ESTATE THE BULK OF THE PROPERTY WAS LEFT TO JULIUS BERYL ON CONDITION THAT HE MARRIED LUCY RANDOLPH
8666-293943-0011 FOR WHOM OTHERWISE NO PROVISION WAS MADE THE NAME OF BERNARD GORE WAS LEFT OUT ALTOGETHER WHEN DURHAM ENDED HE LAID DOWN THE WILL WITH A RATHER REGRETFUL AIR AND DISCREETLY STARED AT THE FIRE HE LIKED YOUNG GORE
8666-293943-0012 AND DID NOT CARE FOR THE ARCHITECT THEREFORE HE WAS ANNOYED THAT THE LATTER SHOULD BENEFIT TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE FORMER GOOD SAID SIR SIMON WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE READING WITH CLOSE ATTENTION WELL HE ASKED HIS NEPHEW
8666-293943-0013 BERYL STAMMERED I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU I AM NOT WORTHY THERE THERE THERE SAID THE OLD MAN TARTLY WE UNDERSTAND ALL THAT CAN YOU SUGGEST ANY ALTERATION NO UNCLE THE WILL IS PERFECT
8666-293943-0014 SAID GORE WITH A DRY CHUCKLE I THINK SAID THE LAWYER HIS EYES STILL ON THE FIRE THAT SOME PROVISION SHOULD BE MADE FOR YOUR GRANDSON HE HAS BEEN TAUGHT TO CONSIDER HIMSELF YOUR HEIR AND HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THAT EXPECTATION
8666-293943-0015 IT IS HARD THAT AT HIS AGE HE SHOULD BE THROWN ON THE WORLD FOR FOR DISOBEDIENCE PUT IN BERYL MEEKLY SIR SIMON CHUCKLED AGAIN YES FOR DISOBEDIENCE
8666-293943-0016 CALLED MISS PLANTAGENET I KNOW SAID THE YOUNG LAWYER NODDING SHE IS THE AUNT OF LORD CONNISTON WHO TOLD ME ABOUT THE MATTER I THOUGHT LORD CONNISTON WAS IN AMERICA SAID JULIUS SHARPLY I SAW HIM BEFORE HE WENT TO AMERICA RETORTED THE SOLICITOR
8666-293943-0017 WHO DID NOT INTEND TO TELL BERYL THAT CONNISTON HAD BEEN IN HIS OFFICE ON THE PREVIOUS DAY WHY DO YOU SAY THAT DO YOU KNOW HIM I KNOW THAT HE HAS A CASTLE NEAR MY UNCLE'S PLACE COVE CASTLE SNAPPED SIR SIMON
8666-293943-0018 ALL THE COUNTY KNOWS THAT BUT HE NEVER COMES NEAR THE PLACE DID YOU MEET LORD CONNISTON AT MISS PLANTAGENET'S JULIUS
8666-293943-0019 TO MISS PLANTAGENET'S ONLY IN THE COMPANY OF BERNARD AHA CHUCKLED SIR SIMON YOU DID NOT FALL IN LOVE WITH THAT GIRL NO UNCLE OF COURSE I AM ENGAGED TO MISS RANDOLPH YOU CAN CALL HER LUCY TO A NEAR RELATIVE LIKE MYSELF
8666-293943-0020 SAID THE BARONET DRYLY DO YOU KNOW MISS MALLESON DURHAM NO I HAVE NOT THAT PLEASURE BUT NO DOUBT BERNARD HAS TOLD YOU ABOUT HER DURHAM SHOOK HIS HEAD I HAVE NOT SEEN GORE FOR MONTHS ARE YOU SURE
8666-293943-0021 HE INHERITS A LITTLE MONEY FROM HIS FATHER AND YOU YES I QUITE UNDERSTAND I HAVE CHARGE OF THAT MONEY GORE CAME A FEW MONTHS AGO AND I GAVE HIM FIFTY POUNDS OR SO THAT WAS AFTER HE QUARRELLED WITH YOU SIR SIMON SINCE THEN
8666-293943-0022 I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM THEN HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT I AM IN CRIMEA SQUARE NOT THAT I KNOW OF CERTAINLY NOT FROM ME IS HE IN TOWN IT WAS BERYL WHO ANSWERED THIS BERNARD HAS ENLISTED AS AN IMPERIAL YEOMAN SAID HE
8666-293943-0023 THEN I THINK THE MORE OF HIM SAID DURHAM QUICKLY EVERY MAN WHO CAN SHOULD GO TO THE FRONT WHY DON'T YOU GO YOURSELF DURHAM IF I HAD NOT MY BUSINESS TO LOOK AFTER I CERTAINLY SHOULD REPLIED THE LAWYER
8666-293943-0024 BUT REGARDING MISTER GORE WILL YOU MAKE ANY PROVISION FOR HIM SIR SIMON
8666-293943-0025 I LEAVE IT TO JULIUS SHOULD THE MONEY COME INTO MY POSSESSION SOON SAID JULIUS VIRTUOUSLY A THING I DO NOT WISH SINCE IT MEANS YOUR DEATH DEAR UNCLE I SHOULD CERTAINLY ALLOW BERNARD TWO HUNDRED A YEAR OUT OF TEN THOUSAND
8666-293943-0026 PUT IN DURHAM HOW GOOD OF YOU HE DESERVES NO MORE FOR HIS DISOBEDIENCE TO HIS BENEFACTOR SIR SIMON CHUCKLED YET AGAIN I AM QUITE OF JULIUS'S OPINION HE DECLARED BERNARD HAS BEHAVED SHAMEFULLY
8666-293943-0027 I WANTED HIM TO MARRY A MISS PERRY WHO IS RICH
8666-293943-0028 THEY CAN LIVE ON TEN THOUSAND A YEAR AND BE HAPPY WHAT IS THE USE OF GETTING MORE MONEY THAN IS NEEDED BESIDES FROM WHAT I HEAR THIS MISS MALLESON IS A CHARMING GIRL WITH NO NAME AND NO POSITION SAID SIR SIMON
8666-293943-0029 A MERE PAID COMPANION I DON'T WANT MY GRANDSON TO MAKE SUCH A BAD MATCH IF HE DOES HE MUST TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES AND HE WILL CERTAINLY HE WILL SAID BERYL ANXIOUS ABOUT THE SIGNING OF THE WILL
8666-293943-0030 HE HAS BEEN HARD HEARTED FOR MONTHS AND SHOWS NO SIGNS OF GIVING IN SINCE I AM TO INHERIT THE MONEY I WILL ALLOW BERNARD TWO HUNDRED A YEAR OR SUCH SUM AS SIR SIMON THINKS FIT TWO HUNDRED IS QUITE ENOUGH SAID THE BARONET
8666-293943-0031 MISTER DURHAM WE WILL SEE NOW ABOUT SIGNING THIS WILL CAN I NOT PERSUADE YOU TO NO
8666-293943-0032 I AM SURE JULIUS HERE WILL MAKE A BETTER USE OF THE MONEY THAN BERNARD WILL WON'T YOU JULIUS I HOPE SO REPLIED BERYL RISING BUT I TRUST IT WILL BE MANY A LONG DAY BEFORE I INHERIT THE MONEY DEAR UNCLE
8666-293943-0033 MAKE YOUR MIND EASY SAID SIR SIMON DRYLY I INTEND TO LIVE FOR MANY A YEAR YET I THINK I HAD BETTER GO NOW OBSERVED JULIUS RISING WON'T YOU STOP AND SEE THE WILL SIGNED NO UNCLE I THINK IT IS BETTER
8666-293943-0034 AS I INHERIT THAT I SHOULD BE OUT OF THE ROOM WHO KNOWS BUT WHAT BERNARD MIGHT SAY DID I REMAIN THAT I EXERCISED UNDUE INFLUENCE NOT WHILE I AM PRESENT SAID DURHAM TOUCHING A BELL
8666-293943-0035 ALL THE SAME I HAD BETTER GO INSISTED THE YOUNG MAN UNCLE PLEASE YOURSELF REPLIED GORE YOU CAN GO IF YOU LIKE I SHALL SEE YOU ON FRIDAY WHEN YOU COME FOR LUCY TO TAKE HER TO THE CURTAIN THEATRE YES BUT I TRUST
8666-293943-0036 AND HERE AS A CLERK ENTERED THE ROOM AND WAS APPARENTLY WITH DURHAM ABOUT TO WITNESS THE WILL JULIUS DEPARTED HE CHUCKLED TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS OUTSIDE THINKING OF HIS GOOD LUCK BUT AT THE DOOR HIS FACE ALTERED HE MIGHT CHANGE HIS MIND
8666-293943-0037 THOUGHT BERYL THERE'S NO RELIANCE TO BE PLACED ON HIM I WISH HE OPENED AND SHUT HIS FIST BUT HE WON'T DIE FOR A LONG TIME WHILE JULIUS WAS INDULGING IN THESE THOUGHTS SIR SIMON HAD TAKEN UP THE WILL TO GLANCE OVER IT
8666-293943-0038 HE ALSO REQUESTED DURHAM TO SEND THE CLERK AWAY FOR A FEW MOMENTS RATHER SURPRISED THE LAWYER DID SO THINKING THE OLD MAN CHANGEABLE WHEN ALONE WITH HIS LEGAL ADVISER THE BARONET WALKED TO THE FIRE AND THRUST THE WILL INTO IT
8666-293943-0039 DURHAM COULD NOT FORBEAR AN EJACULATION OF SURPRISE WHAT'S THAT FOR TO PUNISH JULIUS SAID SIR SIMON PLACIDLY RETURNING TO HIS SEAT
8666-293943-0040 HE TOLD ME ABOUT BERNARD BEING IN LOVE WITH THAT GIRL SO AS TO CREATE TROUBLE BUT YOU DON'T APPROVE OF THE MATCH NO I CERTAINLY DO NOT AND I DARESAY
8666-293943-0041 THAT WHEN I INSISTED ON BERNARD MARRYING MISS PERRY THAT THE TRUTH WOULD HAVE COME OUT ALL THE SAME IT WAS NONE OF BERYL'S BUSINESS TO MAKE MISCHIEF BESIDES HE IS A SLY CREATURE
8666-293943-0042 AND IF I MADE THE WILL IN HIS FAVOR WHO KNOWS BUT WHAT HE MIGHT NOT CONTRIVE TO GET ME OUT OF THE WAY NO SAID DURHAM THOUGHTFULLY
8666-293943-0043 BESIDES PEOPLE DON'T MURDER NOWADAYS DON'T THEY SAID SIR SIMON LOOK IN THE NEWSPAPERS I MEAN THAT WHAT YOU THINK JULIUS MIGHT DO IS WORTHY OF A NOVEL I DON'T FANCY NOVELS ARE TRUE TO LIFE ANYTHING JULIUS DID
8666-293943-0044 I TELL YOU DURHAM HE IS A VILLAIN OF THE WORST I DON'T TRUST HIM
8666-293943-0045 AND WHEN HE LEARNS THE TRUTH HE WILL BE PUNISHED FOR HIS GREED BUT SIR SIMON ARGUED THE LAWYER BY LETTING HIM THINK THE WILL IS MADE IN HIS FAVOR YOU HAVE PLACED HIM IN THE VERY POSITION WHICH ACCORDING TO YOU MIGHT LEAD TO HIS ATTEMPT TO MURDER
8666-293943-0046 FOR CERTAINLY HE WAS ACTING DIFFERENTLY TO WHAT HE SAID BY THE WAY YOU HAVE THE OTHER WILL YES IT LEAVES EVERYTHING TO BERNARD SAVE THE LEGACIES WHICH REMAIN MUCH THE SAME OF COURSE IN THE FIRST WILL IS MENTIONED AN ANNUITY TO MISSUS GILROY
8666-293943-0047 I LEFT HER OUT OF THE NEW WILL THE FACT IS I DON'T TRUST MISSUS GILROY SHE'S TOO FRIENDLY WITH JULIUS FOR MY TASTE I UNDERSTOOD HER TO BE ON THE SIDE OF BERNARD
8666-293943-0048 OH SHE'S ON WHATEVER SIDE SUITS HER SAID SIR SIMON TESTILY HOWEVER LET THE FIRST WILL STAND SHE'S A POOR THING AND HAS HAD A HARD LIFE I HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO LEAVE HER SOMETHING TO LIVE ON WHY
8666-293943-0049 ASKED DURHAM BLUNTLY HE FOUND MISSUS GILROY SOMETHING OF A MYSTERY AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS THE BOND BETWEEN HER AND SIR SIMON NEVER YOU MIND I HAVE MY REASONS SO LET THINGS REMAIN AS THEY ARE
8666-293943-0050 BERNARD CAN MARRY MISS MALLESON WHEN I AM DEAD IF HE CHOOSES HE THINKS HE HAS BEEN DISINHERITED YES I TOLD HIM SO
8666-293943-0051 WON'T YOU TAKE HIM BACK INTO FAVOR AND TELL HIM
8666-293943-0052 NOT AT PRESENT IF WE MET THERE WOULD ONLY BE MORE TROUBLE HE HAS A TEMPER INHERITED FROM HIS ITALIAN MOTHER AND I HAVE A TEMPER ALSO
8666-293943-0053 BUT I DON'T WANT HIM TO GO TO THE WAR HE MUST BE BOUGHT OUT I FEAR BERNARD IS NOT THE MAN TO BE BOUGHT OUT OH I KNOW HE IS BRAVE ENOUGH
8666-293943-0054 THE ELEVENTH HOUR WHEN WAR IS ON
8666-293943-0055 ALL THE SAME I DON'T WANT HIM TO BE SHOT
8666-293943-0056 IN WHICH YOU CAN MAKE HIM GIVE UP HIS SOLDIERING WHAT'S THAT MAKE FRIENDS WITH HIM AND ASK HIM TO WAIT TILL YOU DIE NO NO NO SAID SIR SIMON IRRITABLY HE MUST KEEP AWAY FROM ME FOR A TIME AFTER ALL
8666-293943-0057 HE IS THE SON OF HIS FATHER AND BAD AS WALTER WAS I LOVED HIM FOR HIS MOTHER'S SAKE AS FOR THE ITALIAN WOMAN MISSUS GORE SHE IS DEAD
8666-293943-0058 AND A SCOUNDREL HE IS THE OTHER DAY HE CAME TO THE HALL AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS WAY INTO THE HOUSE A GAMBLER A ROGUE DURHAM
8666-293943-0059 WHAT IS HIS OTHER NAME TOLOMEO HE COMES FROM SIENA I UNDERSTOOD MISSUS GORE YOUR SON'S WIFE CAME FROM FLORENCE SO SHE SAID SHE DECLARED SHE WAS THE MEMBER OF A DECAYED FLORENTINE FAMILY
8666-293943-0060 THE TOLOMEO NOBLES ARE SIENESE AND A BAD LOT THEY ARE HE IS A MUSICIAN I BELIEVE A PLAUSIBLE SCAMP I HOPE HE HAS NOT GOT HOLD OF BERNARD BERNARD IS HIS NEPHEW I KNOW THAT SNAPPED THE OLD MAN
8666-293943-0061 ALL THE SAME THE UNCLE IS
8666-293943-0062 I DON'T THINK GORE IS THE MAN TO BE CONTROLLED SAID DURHAM SAGELY YOU DON'T KNOW HE IS YOUNG AFTER ALL BUT YOU KNOW BY THE WILL I HAVE
8666-293943-0063 PUT IT OUT OF BERNARD'S POWER TO ASSIST TOLOMEO IF HE GIVES HIM AS MUCH AS A SHILLING THE MONEY IS LOST TO HIM AND GOES TO LUCY
8666-293943-0064 BUT I MUST GET HOME NOW BY THE WAY ABOUT THAT LEASE AND THE TWO BEGAN TO TALK OF MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE ESTATE
8666-293943-0065 INSISTED ON RECURRING TO THE FORBIDDEN SUBJECT HOWEVER IT WAS JUST WHEN THE OLD MAN WAS GOING THAT HE REVERTED TO THE BONE OF CONTENTION I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME TELL BERNARD THAT YOU ARE WELL DISPOSED TOWARD HIM AH YOU
8666-293943-0066 PLEAD FOR THE SCAMP SAID SIR SIMON ANGRILY
8666-293943-0067 YOU KNOW AND WE ARE GREAT FRIENDS IF HE IS AN IMPERIAL YEOMAN THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY IN SEEING HIM
8666-293943-0068 I HAVE ASCERTAINED THAT HE WON'T GO TO THE WAR FOR SIX WEEKS JULIUS FOUND THAT OUT FOR ME SO WAIT TILL HE IS ON THE EVE OF SAILING
8666-293943-0069 IF NOTHING ELSE WILL KEEP HIM AT HOME I'LL MAKE IT UP BUT I THINK A LITTLE HARDSHIP WILL DO HIM GOOD HE BEHAVED VERY BADLY BERNARD IS NATURALLY HOT TEMPERED
8666-293943-0070 THEREFORE LET US KEEP APART FOR A TIME WHO KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN DID WE MEET NO DURHAM LET BERNARD THINK THAT I AM STILL ANGRY IF LUCY SETS A LAMP IN THE RED WINDOW THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING I SHAN'T INTERFERE
8666-293943-0071 WITH HER ROMANCE THE RED WINDOW WHAT'S THAT
