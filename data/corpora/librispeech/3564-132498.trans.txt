3564-132498-0000 HE WAS PARTICULARLY DRAWN TO THESE CLERKS BY THE FACT THAT THEY BOTH HAD CROOKED NOSES ONE BENT TO THE LEFT AND THE OTHER TO THE RIGHT
3564-132498-0001 WHERE HE PAID FOR THEIR ENTRANCE THERE WAS ONE LANKY THREE YEAR OLD PINE TREE AND THREE BUSHES IN THE GARDEN BESIDES A VAUXHALL WHICH WAS IN REALITY A DRINKING BAR WHERE TEA TOO WAS SERVED AND THERE WERE
3564-132498-0002 A FEW GREEN TABLES AND CHAIRS STANDING ROUND IT
3564-132498-0003 THE CLERKS QUARRELLED WITH SOME OTHER CLERKS AND A FIGHT SEEMED IMMINENT SVIDRIGAILOV WAS CHOSEN TO DECIDE THE DISPUTE
3564-132498-0004 BUT THEY SHOUTED SO LOUD THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF UNDERSTANDING THEM THE ONLY FACT THAT SEEMED CERTAIN WAS THAT ONE OF THEM HAD STOLEN SOMETHING AND HAD EVEN SUCCEEDED IN SELLING IT ON THE SPOT TO A JEW
3564-132498-0005 BUT WOULD NOT SHARE THE SPOIL WITH HIS COMPANION FINALLY IT APPEARED THAT THE STOLEN OBJECT WAS A TEASPOON BELONGING TO THE VAUXHALL IT WAS MISSED AND THE AFFAIR BEGAN TO SEEM TROUBLESOME
3564-132498-0006 AND WALKED OUT OF THE GARDEN IT WAS ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK HE HAD NOT DRUNK A DROP OF WINE ALL THIS TIME
3564-132498-0007 THREATENING STORM CLOUDS CAME OVER THE SKY ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK THERE WAS A CLAP OF THUNDER AND THE RAIN CAME DOWN LIKE A WATERFALL THE WATER FELL NOT IN DROPS BUT BEAT ON THE EARTH IN STREAMS
3564-132498-0008 THERE WERE FLASHES OF LIGHTNING EVERY MINUTE AND EACH FLASH LASTED WHILE ONE COULD COUNT FIVE DRENCHED TO THE SKIN HE WENT HOME LOCKED HIMSELF IN OPENED THE BUREAU TOOK OUT ALL HIS MONEY
3564-132498-0009 AND TORE UP TWO OR THREE PAPERS THEN PUTTING THE MONEY IN HIS POCKET HE WAS ABOUT TO CHANGE HIS CLOTHES BUT LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW AND LISTENING TO THE THUNDER AND THE RAIN HE GAVE UP THE IDEA
3564-132498-0010 TOOK UP HIS HAT AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM WITHOUT LOCKING THE DOOR HE WENT STRAIGHT TO SONIA SHE WAS AT HOME SHE WAS NOT ALONE THE FOUR KAPERNAUMOV CHILDREN WERE WITH HER SHE WAS GIVING THEM TEA
3564-132498-0011 SHE RECEIVED SVIDRIGAILOV IN RESPECTFUL SILENCE LOOKING WONDERINGLY AT HIS SOAKING CLOTHES THE CHILDREN ALL RAN AWAY AT ONCE IN INDESCRIBABLE TERROR
3564-132498-0012 SVIDRIGAILOV SAT DOWN AT THE TABLE AND ASKED SONIA TO SIT BESIDE HIM SHE TIMIDLY PREPARED TO LISTEN I MAY BE GOING TO AMERICA SOFYA SEMYONOVNA

3564-132498-0026 OF COURSE YOU DO HE'S NOT A BAD FELLOW TAKE IT TO HIM TO MORROW OR WHEN THE TIME COMES AND TILL THEN HIDE IT CAREFULLY
3564-132498-0027 SHE LONGED TO SPEAK TO ASK A QUESTION BUT FOR THE FIRST MOMENTS SHE DID NOT DARE AND DID NOT KNOW HOW TO BEGIN HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU BE GOING NOW
3564-132498-0028 WHY BE STARTING FOR AMERICA AND BE STOPPED BY RAIN HA HA
3564-132498-0029 BY THE WAY TELL MISTER RAZUMIHIN I SEND MY GREETINGS TO HIM TELL HIM ARKADY IVANOVITCH SVIDRIGAILOV SENDS HIS GREETINGS BE SURE TO HE WENT OUT LEAVING SONIA IN A STATE OF WONDERING
3564-132498-0030 ANXIETY AND VAGUE APPREHENSION IT APPEARED AFTERWARDS THAT ON THE SAME EVENING AT TWENTY PAST ELEVEN HE MADE ANOTHER VERY ECCENTRIC AND UNEXPECTED VISIT THE RAIN STILL PERSISTED
3564-132498-0031 LIVED IN THIRD STREET IN VASSILYEVSKY ISLAND HE KNOCKED SOME TIME BEFORE HE WAS ADMITTED AND HIS VISIT AT FIRST CAUSED GREAT PERTURBATION BUT SVIDRIGAILOV COULD BE VERY FASCINATING WHEN HE LIKED
3564-132498-0032 VANISHED IMMEDIATELY THE DECREPIT FATHER WAS WHEELED IN TO SEE SVIDRIGAILOV BY THE TENDER AND SENSIBLE MOTHER WHO AS USUAL BEGAN THE CONVERSATION WITH VARIOUS IRRELEVANT QUESTIONS SHE NEVER ASKED A DIRECT QUESTION
3564-132498-0033 BUT BEGAN BY SMILING AND RUBBING HER HANDS AND THEN
3564-132498-0034 FOR INSTANCE WHEN SVIDRIGAILOV WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE WEDDING SHE WOULD BEGIN BY INTERESTED AND ALMOST EAGER QUESTIONS ABOUT PARIS AND THE COURT LIFE THERE AND ONLY BY DEGREES BROUGHT THE CONVERSATION ROUND TO THIRD STREET
3564-132498-0035 ON OTHER OCCASIONS THIS HAD OF COURSE BEEN VERY IMPRESSIVE BUT THIS TIME ARKADY IVANOVITCH SEEMED PARTICULARLY IMPATIENT AND INSISTED ON SEEING HIS BETROTHED AT ONCE
3564-132498-0036 THOUGH HE HAD BEEN INFORMED TO BEGIN WITH THAT SHE HAD ALREADY GONE TO BED THE GIRL OF COURSE APPEARED SVIDRIGAILOV INFORMED HER AT ONCE THAT HE WAS OBLIGED
3564-132498-0037 REFLECTED AND KISSED HER AGAIN
3564-132498-0038 AT THE THOUGHT THAT HIS PRESENT WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY LOCKED UP IN THE KEEPING OF THE MOST SENSIBLE OF MOTHERS HE WENT AWAY LEAVING THEM ALL IN A STATE OF EXTRAORDINARY EXCITEMENT BUT THE TENDER MAMMA SPEAKING QUIETLY IN A HALF WHISPER
3564-132498-0039 SETTLED SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THEIR DOUBTS CONCLUDING THAT SVIDRIGAILOV WAS A GREAT MAN A MAN OF GREAT AFFAIRS AND CONNECTIONS AND OF GREAT WEALTH THERE WAS NO KNOWING WHAT HE HAD IN HIS MIND
3564-132498-0040 HE WOULD START OFF ON A JOURNEY AND GIVE AWAY MONEY JUST AS THE FANCY TOOK HIM SO THAT THERE WAS NOTHING SURPRISING ABOUT IT OF COURSE IT WAS STRANGE THAT HE WAS
3564-132498-0041 AND ALL THESE PEOPLE OF HIGH SOCIETY DIDN'T THINK OF WHAT WAS SAID OF THEM AND DIDN'T STAND ON CEREMONY POSSIBLY INDEED HE CAME LIKE THAT ON PURPOSE TO SHOW THAT HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF ANYONE ABOVE ALL
3564-132498-0042 NOT A WORD SHOULD BE SAID ABOUT IT FOR GOD KNOWS WHAT MIGHT COME OF IT AND THE MONEY MUST BE LOCKED UP AND IT WAS MOST FORTUNATE THAT FEDOSYA THE COOK HAD NOT LEFT THE KITCHEN
3564-132498-0043 AND SO ON AND SO ON THEY SAT UP WHISPERING TILL TWO O'CLOCK BUT THE GIRL WENT TO BED MUCH EARLIER AMAZED AND RATHER SORROWFUL SVIDRIGAILOV MEANWHILE EXACTLY AT MIDNIGHT CROSSED THE BRIDGE ON THE WAY BACK TO THE MAINLAND
3564-132498-0044 BUT CONTINUALLY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE STREET HE HAD NOTICED PASSING THROUGH THIS STREET LATELY THAT THERE WAS A HOTEL SOMEWHERE TOWARDS THE END BUILT OF WOOD BUT FAIRLY LARGE AND ITS NAME HE REMEMBERED WAS SOMETHING LIKE ADRIANOPLE
3564-132498-0045 HE WAS NOT MISTAKEN THE HOTEL WAS SO CONSPICUOUS IN THAT GOD FORSAKEN PLACE THAT HE COULD NOT FAIL TO SEE IT EVEN IN THE DARK IT WAS A LONG BLACKENED WOODEN BUILDING AND IN SPITE OF THE LATE HOUR
3564-132498-0046 THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE WINDOWS AND SIGNS OF LIFE WITHIN HE WENT IN AND ASKED A RAGGED FELLOW WHO MET HIM IN THE CORRIDOR FOR A ROOM THE LATTER SCANNING SVIDRIGAILOV PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER AND LED HIM
3564-132498-0047 AT ONCE TO A CLOSE AND TINY ROOM IN THE DISTANCE AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR UNDER THE STAIRS THERE WAS NO OTHER ALL WERE OCCUPIED THE RAGGED FELLOW LOOKED INQUIRINGLY IS THERE TEA ASKED SVIDRIGAILOV YES SIR WHAT ELSE IS THERE
3564-132498-0048 VEAL VODKA SAVOURIES BRING ME TEA AND VEAL AND YOU WANT NOTHING ELSE HE ASKED WITH APPARENT SURPRISE NOTHING NOTHING THE RAGGED MAN WENT AWAY COMPLETELY
3564-132498-0049 HOW WAS IT I DIDN'T KNOW IT I EXPECT I LOOK AS IF I CAME FROM A CAFE CHANTANT AND HAVE HAD SOME ADVENTURE ON THE WAY IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW WHO STAY HERE HE LIGHTED THE CANDLE AND LOOKED AT THE ROOM MORE CAREFULLY
3564-132498-0050 THE WALLS LOOKED AS THOUGH THEY WERE MADE OF PLANKS COVERED WITH SHABBY PAPER
3564-132498-0051 YELLOW COULD STILL BE MADE OUT ONE OF THE WALLS WAS CUT SHORT BY THE SLOPING CEILING
3564-132498-0052 THE MURMUR HAD NOT CEASED FROM THE MOMENT HE ENTERED THE ROOM HE LISTENED SOMEONE WAS UPBRAIDING AND ALMOST TEARFULLY SCOLDING BUT HE HEARD ONLY ONE VOICE
3564-132498-0053 ONE OF THEM A VERY CURLY HEADED MAN WITH A RED INFLAMED FACE WAS STANDING IN THE POSE OF AN ORATOR WITHOUT HIS COAT WITH HIS LEGS WIDE APART TO PRESERVE HIS BALANCE AND SMITING HIMSELF ON THE BREAST
3564-132498-0054 AND THAT ONLY THE FINGER OF PROVIDENCE SEES IT ALL
3564-132498-0055 BUT OBVIOUSLY HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
3564-132498-0056 THERE WERE WINE GLASSES A NEARLY EMPTY BOTTLE OF VODKA BREAD AND CUCUMBER AND GLASSES WITH THE DREGS OF STALE TEA AFTER GAZING ATTENTIVELY AT THIS SVIDRIGAILOV TURNED AWAY INDIFFERENTLY AND SAT DOWN ON THE BED
3564-132498-0057 THE RAGGED ATTENDANT RETURNING WITH THE TEA COULD NOT RESIST ASKING HIM AGAIN WHETHER HE DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING MORE AND AGAIN RECEIVING A NEGATIVE REPLY FINALLY WITHDREW
3564-132498-0058 HE BEGAN TO FEEL FEVERISH HE TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND WRAPPING HIMSELF IN THE BLANKET LAY DOWN ON THE BED HE WAS ANNOYED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO BE WELL FOR THE OCCASION HE THOUGHT WITH A SMILE THE ROOM WAS CLOSE
3564-132498-0059 THE CANDLE BURNT DIMLY THE WIND WAS ROARING OUTSIDE HE HEARD A MOUSE SCRATCHING IN THE CORNER AND THE ROOM SMELT OF MICE AND OF LEATHER HE LAY IN A SORT OF REVERIE ONE THOUGHT FOLLOWED ANOTHER HE FELT A LONGING TO FIX HIS IMAGINATION ON SOMETHING
3564-132498-0060 IT MUST BE A GARDEN UNDER THE WINDOW HE THOUGHT THERE'S A SOUND OF TREES HOW I DISLIKE THE SOUND OF TREES ON A STORMY NIGHT IN THE DARK THEY GIVE ONE A HORRID FEELING HE REMEMBERED HOW HE HAD DISLIKED IT
3564-132498-0061 THIS REMINDED HIM OF THE BRIDGE OVER THE LITTLE NEVA AND HE FELT COLD AGAIN AS HE HAD WHEN STANDING THERE I NEVER HAVE LIKED WATER HE THOUGHT EVEN IN A LANDSCAPE AND HE SUDDENLY SMILED AGAIN AT A STRANGE IDEA
3564-132498-0062 BUT I'VE BECOME MORE PARTICULAR LIKE AN ANIMAL THAT PICKS OUT A SPECIAL PLACE FOR SUCH AN OCCASION
3564-132498-0063 I SUPPOSE IT SEEMED DARK COLD HA HA
3564-132498-0064 BY THE WAY WHY HAVEN'T I PUT OUT THE CANDLE HE BLEW IT OUT THEY'VE GONE TO BED NEXT DOOR HE THOUGHT NOT SEEING THE LIGHT AT THE CRACK WELL NOW MARFA PETROVNA NOW IS THE TIME FOR YOU TO TURN UP IT'S DARK AND THE VERY TIME AND PLACE FOR YOU
3564-132498-0065 BUT NOW YOU WON'T COME HE SUDDENLY RECALLED HOW AN HOUR BEFORE CARRYING OUT HIS DESIGN ON DOUNIA HE HAD RECOMMENDED RASKOLNIKOV TO TRUST HER TO RAZUMIHIN'S KEEPING
3564-132498-0066 BUT WHAT A ROGUE THAT RASKOLNIKOV IS HE'S GONE THROUGH A GOOD DEAL HE MAY BE A SUCCESSFUL ROGUE IN TIME
3564-132498-0067 BUT NOW HE'S TOO EAGER FOR LIFE THESE YOUNG MEN ARE CONTEMPTIBLE ON THAT POINT BUT HANG THE FELLOW LET HIM PLEASE HIMSELF IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH ME HE COULD NOT GET TO SLEEP
3564-132498-0068 AND A SHUDDER RAN OVER HIM NO I MUST GIVE UP ALL THAT NOW HE THOUGHT ROUSING HIMSELF I MUST THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE IT'S QUEER AND FUNNY I NEVER HAD A GREAT HATRED FOR ANYONE
3564-132498-0069 A BAD SIGN A BAD SIGN I NEVER LIKED QUARRELLING EITHER AND NEVER LOST MY TEMPER THAT'S A BAD SIGN TOO AND THE PROMISES I MADE HER JUST NOW TOO DAMNATION
3564-132498-0070 BUT WHO KNOWS PERHAPS SHE WOULD HAVE MADE A NEW MAN OF ME SOMEHOW HE GROUND HIS TEETH AND SANK INTO SILENCE AGAIN AGAIN DOUNIA'S IMAGE ROSE BEFORE HIM JUST AS SHE WAS WHEN AFTER SHOOTING THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD LOWERED THE REVOLVER IN TERROR AND
3564-132498-0071 GAZED BLANKLY AT HIM SO THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SEIZED HER TWICE OVER AND SHE WOULD NOT HAVE LIFTED A HAND TO DEFEND HERSELF IF HE HAD NOT REMINDED HER HE RECALLED HOW AT THAT INSTANT HE FELT ALMOST SORRY FOR HER
3564-132498-0072 AIE DAMNATION THESE THOUGHTS AGAIN I MUST PUT IT AWAY HE WAS DOZING OFF THE FEVERISH SHIVER HAD CEASED WHEN SUDDENLY SOMETHING SEEMED TO RUN OVER HIS ARM AND LEG UNDER THE BEDCLOTHES HE STARTED UGH HANG IT
3564-132498-0073 I BELIEVE IT'S A MOUSE HE THOUGHT THAT'S THE VEAL I LEFT ON THE TABLE HE FELT FEARFULLY DISINCLINED TO PULL OFF THE BLANKET GET UP GET COLD BUT ALL AT ONCE SOMETHING UNPLEASANT RAN OVER HIS LEG AGAIN HE PULLED OFF THE BLANKET AND LIGHTED THE CANDLE
3564-132498-0074 SHAKING WITH FEVERISH CHILL HE BENT DOWN TO EXAMINE THE BED THERE WAS NOTHING HE SHOOK THE BLANKET AND SUDDENLY A MOUSE JUMPED OUT ON THE SHEET
3564-132498-0075 BUT THE MOUSE RAN TO AND FRO IN ZIGZAGS WITHOUT LEAVING THE BED SLIPPED BETWEEN HIS FINGERS RAN OVER HIS HAND AND SUDDENLY DARTED UNDER THE PILLOW HE THREW DOWN THE PILLOW BUT IN ONE INSTANT FELT SOMETHING LEAP ON HIS CHEST AND DART OVER HIS BODY
3564-132498-0076 AND DOWN HIS BACK UNDER HIS SHIRT HE TREMBLED NERVOUSLY AND WOKE UP THE ROOM WAS DARK
3564-132498-0077 THE WIND WAS HOWLING UNDER THE WINDOW HOW DISGUSTING HE THOUGHT WITH ANNOYANCE HE GOT UP AND SAT ON THE EDGE OF THE BEDSTEAD WITH HIS BACK TO THE WINDOW IT'S BETTER NOT TO SLEEP AT ALL HE DECIDED
3564-132498-0078 HE WAS NOT THINKING OF ANYTHING AND DID NOT WANT TO THINK BUT ONE IMAGE ROSE AFTER ANOTHER INCOHERENT SCRAPS OF THOUGHT WITHOUT BEGINNING OR END PASSED THROUGH HIS MIND HE SANK INTO DROWSINESS PERHAPS THE COLD OR THE DAMPNESS OR THE DARK
3564-132498-0079 OR THE WIND THAT HOWLED UNDER THE WINDOW AND TOSSED THE TREES ROUSED A SORT OF PERSISTENT CRAVING FOR THE FANTASTIC HE KEPT DWELLING ON IMAGES OF FLOWERS HE FANCIED A CHARMING FLOWER GARDEN A BRIGHT WARM ALMOST HOT DAY A HOLIDAY
3564-132498-0080 TRINITY DAY A FINE SUMPTUOUS COUNTRY COTTAGE IN THE ENGLISH TASTE OVERGROWN WITH FRAGRANT FLOWERS
3564-132498-0081 WITH FLOWER BEDS GOING ROUND THE HOUSE THE PORCH WREATHED IN CLIMBERS WAS SURROUNDED WITH BEDS OF ROSES A LIGHT COOL STAIRCASE CARPETED WITH RICH RUGS WAS DECORATED WITH RARE PLANTS IN CHINA POTS
3564-132498-0082 HE NOTICED PARTICULARLY IN THE WINDOWS NOSEGAYS OF TENDER WHITE HEAVILY FRAGRANT NARCISSUS BENDING OVER THEIR BRIGHT GREEN THICK LONG STALKS HE WAS RELUCTANT TO MOVE AWAY FROM THEM
3564-132498-0083 THE FLOORS WERE STREWN WITH FRESHLY CUT FRAGRANT HAY
3564-132498-0084 CAME INTO THE ROOM THE BIRDS WERE CHIRRUPING UNDER THE WINDOW AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM ON A TABLE COVERED WITH A WHITE SATIN SHROUD STOOD A COFFIN THE COFFIN WAS COVERED WITH WHITE SILK AND EDGED WITH A THICK WHITE FRILL
3564-132498-0085 AMONG THE FLOWERS LAY A GIRL IN A WHITE MUSLIN DRESS
3564-132498-0086 BUT HER LOOSE FAIR HAIR WAS WET THERE WAS A WREATH OF ROSES ON HER HEAD
3564-132498-0087 AND THE SMILE ON HER PALE LIPS WAS FULL OF AN IMMENSE UNCHILDISH MISERY AND SORROWFUL APPEAL SVIDRIGAILOV KNEW THAT GIRL THERE WAS NO HOLY IMAGE NO BURNING CANDLE BESIDE THE COFFIN NO SOUND OF PRAYERS THE GIRL HAD DROWNED HERSELF
3564-132498-0088 SHE WAS ONLY FOURTEEN BUT HER HEART WAS BROKEN AND SHE HAD DESTROYED HERSELF CRUSHED BY AN INSULT THAT HAD APPALLED AND AMAZED THAT CHILDISH SOUL HAD SMIRCHED THAT ANGEL PURITY WITH UNMERITED DISGRACE AND TORN FROM HER A LAST SCREAM OF DESPAIR
3564-132498-0089 UNHEEDED AND BRUTALLY DISREGARDED
3564-132498-0090 THE WIND HOWLED SVIDRIGAILOV CAME TO HIMSELF GOT UP FROM THE BED AND WENT TO THE WINDOW HE FELT FOR THE LATCH AND OPENED IT THE WIND LASHED FURIOUSLY INTO THE LITTLE ROOM AND STUNG HIS FACE AND HIS CHEST
3564-132498-0091 UNDER THE WINDOW THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING LIKE A GARDEN AND APPARENTLY A PLEASURE GARDEN THERE TOO PROBABLY THERE WERE
3564-132498-0092 NOW DROPS OF RAIN FLEW IN
3564-132498-0093 SO THAT HE COULD ONLY JUST MAKE OUT SOME DARK BLURS OF OBJECTS SVIDRIGAILOV BENDING DOWN WITH ELBOWS ON THE WINDOW SILL GAZED FOR FIVE MINUTES INTO THE DARKNESS
3564-132498-0094 RESOUNDED IN THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT AH THE SIGNAL THE RIVER IS OVERFLOWING HE THOUGHT
3564-132498-0095 FLOODING THE BASEMENTS AND CELLARS THE CELLAR RATS WILL SWIM OUT AND MEN WILL CURSE IN THE RAIN AND WIND AS THEY DRAG THEIR RUBBISH TO THEIR UPPER STOREYS WHAT TIME IS IT NOW
3564-132498-0096 AND HE HAD HARDLY THOUGHT IT WHEN SOMEWHERE NEAR A CLOCK ON THE WALL TICKING AWAY HURRIEDLY STRUCK THREE AHA IT WILL BE LIGHT IN AN HOUR WHY WAIT I'LL GO OUT AT ONCE STRAIGHT TO THE PARK I'LL CHOOSE A GREAT BUSH THERE DRENCHED WITH RAIN
3564-132498-0097 SO THAT AS SOON AS ONE'S SHOULDER TOUCHES IT MILLIONS OF DROPS DRIP ON ONE'S HEAD HE MOVED AWAY FROM THE WINDOW SHUT IT LIGHTED THE CANDLE PUT ON HIS WAISTCOAT HIS OVERCOAT
3564-132498-0098 AND HIS HAT AND WENT OUT CARRYING THE CANDLE INTO THE PASSAGE TO LOOK FOR THE RAGGED ATTENDANT WHO WOULD BE ASLEEP SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDST
3564-132498-0099 IT'S THE BEST MINUTE I COULDN'T CHOOSE A BETTER
3564-132498-0100 BETWEEN AN OLD CUPBOARD AND THE DOOR HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A STRANGE OBJECT WHICH SEEMED TO BE ALIVE HE BENT DOWN WITH THE CANDLE AND SAW A LITTLE GIRL NOT MORE THAN FIVE YEARS OLD SHIVERING AND CRYING WITH HER CLOTHES AS WET AS A SOAKING HOUSE FLANNEL
3564-132498-0101 SHE DID NOT SEEM AFRAID OF SVIDRIGAILOV BUT LOOKED AT HIM WITH BLANK AMAZEMENT OUT OF HER BIG BLACK EYES NOW AND THEN SHE SOBBED AS CHILDREN DO WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN CRYING A LONG TIME BUT ARE BEGINNING TO BE COMFORTED THE CHILD'S FACE WAS PALE AND TIRED
3564-132498-0102 SHE WAS NUMB WITH COLD HOW CAN SHE HAVE COME HERE SHE MUST HAVE HIDDEN HERE AND NOT SLEPT ALL NIGHT HE BEGAN QUESTIONING HER THE CHILD SUDDENLY BECOMING ANIMATED CHATTERED AWAY IN HER BABY LANGUAGE
3564-132498-0103 SOMETHING ABOUT MAMMY AND THAT MAMMY WOULD BEAT HER AND ABOUT SOME CUP THAT SHE HAD BWOKEN THE CHILD CHATTERED ON WITHOUT STOPPING HE COULD ONLY GUESS FROM WHAT SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS A NEGLECTED CHILD WHOSE MOTHER PROBABLY A DRUNKEN COOK
3564-132498-0104 IN THE SERVICE OF THE HOTEL WHIPPED AND FRIGHTENED HER THAT THE CHILD HAD BROKEN A CUP OF HER MOTHER'S AND WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT SHE HAD RUN AWAY THE EVENING BEFORE HAD HIDDEN FOR A LONG WHILE SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE IN THE RAIN AT LAST HAD MADE HER WAY IN HERE
3564-132498-0105 AND SPENT THE NIGHT THERE CRYING AND TREMBLING FROM THE DAMP THE DARKNESS AND THE FEAR THAT SHE WOULD BE BADLY BEATEN FOR IT HE TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS WENT BACK TO HIS ROOM
3564-132498-0106 AND BEGAN UNDRESSING HER THE TORN SHOES WHICH SHE HAD ON HER STOCKINGLESS FEET WERE AS WET AS IF THEY HAD BEEN STANDING IN A PUDDLE ALL NIGHT WHEN HE HAD UNDRESSED HER HE PUT HER ON THE BED COVERED HER UP AND WRAPPED HER IN THE BLANKET FROM HER HEAD DOWNWARDS
3564-132498-0107 SHE FELL ASLEEP AT ONCE THEN HE SANK INTO DREARY MUSING AGAIN WHAT FOLLY TO TROUBLE MYSELF HE DECIDED SUDDENLY WITH AN OPPRESSIVE FEELING OF ANNOYANCE
3564-132498-0108 IN VEXATION HE TOOK UP THE CANDLE TO GO AND LOOK FOR THE RAGGED ATTENDANT AGAIN AND MAKE HASTE TO GO AWAY DAMN THE CHILD HE THOUGHT AS HE OPENED THE DOOR BUT HE TURNED AGAIN TO SEE WHETHER THE CHILD WAS ASLEEP HE RAISED THE BLANKET CAREFULLY THE CHILD WAS SLEEPING SOUNDLY
3564-132498-0109 SHE HAD GOT WARM UNDER THE BLANKET AND HER PALE CHEEKS WERE FLUSHED
3564-132498-0110 OF CHILDHOOD IT'S A FLUSH OF FEVER THOUGHT SVIDRIGAILOV IT WAS LIKE THE FLUSH FROM DRINKING AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN GIVEN A FULL GLASS TO DRINK HER CRIMSON LIPS WERE HOT AND GLOWING BUT WHAT WAS THIS HE SUDDENLY FANCIED THAT HER LONG BLACK
3564-132498-0111 EYELASHES WERE QUIVERING AS THOUGH THE LIDS WERE OPENING AND A SLY CRAFTY EYE PEEPED OUT
3564-132498-0112 YES IT WAS SO HER LIPS PARTED IN A SMILE THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH QUIVERED
3564-132498-0113 BUT NOW SHE QUITE GAVE UP ALL EFFORT NOW IT WAS A GRIN A BROAD GRIN THERE WAS SOMETHING SHAMELESS PROVOCATIVE

3564-132498-0119 SOME FLIES WOKE UP AND SETTLED ON THE UNTOUCHED VEAL WHICH WAS STILL ON THE TABLE
3564-132498-0120 HE TRIED TILL HE WAS TIRED BUT COULD NOT CATCH IT AT LAST REALISING THAT HE WAS ENGAGED IN THIS INTERESTING PURSUIT HE STARTED GOT UP AND WALKED RESOLUTELY OUT OF THE ROOM A MINUTE LATER HE WAS IN THE STREET A THICK MILKY MIST HUNG OVER THE TOWN
